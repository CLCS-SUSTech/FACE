Many were left disappointed, although those willing to keep the lands in their homes were allowed to come and visit once a year. During the 1950s and 60s, the Kalihi Club of the Spokane Valley provided a wonderful environment for many, and many were happy to have seen it restored. In the 70s and 80s, we found that some of the many people who were dissatisfied were taking their money home because they were worried that they would lose their homes with the loss of historic resources.

{"id":878,"ended":true,"length":187,"gen_text":"Writing Merrifield's obituary for The Independent newspaper, the Museum of London archaeologist Peter Marsden described The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic as `` a masterly study of an unusual subject. `` The findings are startling in that they reveal the earliest history of magic in the Middle Ages, and indicate that the magic of the Renaissance did not take place in the way that the rituals in medieval art depicted. While myths and legends about rituals have long been woven into the fabric of society, the early days of magic have been obscured by the mists and the phantoms of antiquity. According to Marsden, The Archaeology of Ritual and Magick has demonstrated that `the first use of magic in the Middle Ages was to make ritual and magic products for the common good, but it was not until the invention of modern magic devices that this became more visible.'' As a result, the myth of molesters and other incendiaries has received less attention in its recent history, but the research suggests otherwise.","token_len":205,"entropy":[10.7652,4.2974,2.1876,0.2641,2.8386,8.914,0.6157,0.0149,2.5534,5.45,5.0798,3.8182,1.7044,2.9765,10.8311,0.6373,3.9498,8.5354,0.0895,5.2327,8.6061,0.2288,3.2996,4.9743,7.02,1.0739,0.2145,9.8819,2.6845,6.0817,0.6467,10.0215,6.0577,5.5592,2.0044,3.8394,0.4374,4.7496,5.3835,3.9263,2.0945,5.1521,2.1139,5.2584,2.2285,4.7415,2.8979,2.5948,0.7143,2.1857,1.721,4.9244,4.8046,0.0868,1.7356,1.3088,1.3013,2.7982,0.1736,1.1796,1.4138,4.9175,0.6026,1.7183,3.5634,1.0913,1.1488,4.8815,4.4891,0.0971,3.0655,0.6528,1.0535,1.7614,5.1361,1.5309,2.6178,5.7885,4.0022,2.4058,5.09,3.343,0.5501,5.2111,6.0258,1.4235,0.8432,2.7972,4.7927,3.0653,1.8835,0.661,5.131,0.2636,1.4349,0.7931,0.008,3.245,0.3008,1.8773,4.9894,4.9223,0.0467,0.8765,2.553,0.7843,5.2391,0.4628,1.5708,5.841,0.8102,2.1345,2.8663,6.2434,0.3166,0.723,0.4595,4.3927,0.4319,5.9333,0.0011,2.3115,0.0004,0.1412,2.8309,0.7165,0.0142,0.007,0.0073,0.0534,7.3486,0.0563,3.0128,4.313,0.5434,5.8268,1.5922,3.6559,4.9468,0.0862,0.6117,1.2781,1.0534,0.6239,0.0063,0.3445,2.2917,3.3573,4.9687,2.466,0.861,4.941,3.221,1.3569,3.2363,2.7014,1.4626,3.4332,2.4436,1.0896,1.0678,2.3856,0.4172,4.954,0.0995,4.0923,1.4117,4.8008,0.7635,2.7688,2.9818,4.2037,4.7329,1.3814,4.5377,2.3395,0.3202,0.3644,1.4523,5.4168,1.0282,6.3581,4.72,1.9658,1.0779,3.8104,5.6357,3.1162,0.0352,2.0344,5.3145,3.6307,0.6159,1.7783,5.9359,4.7163,1.8039,1.5738,1.8145,1.9106,4.5933,3.7226,5.8693,0.1507]}

The design elements included the new Bridge, the new Watery Bridge-head, and the original Bridge of Light. The proposed designs have the potential to create up to 70,000 new homes and retail stores, 1,000 new jobs, and significant benefits for New Englanders.

Wolves are a major host for rabies in Russia, where they live in herds of almost 50 deer and some sheep. The species most closely related to Eurasian wolves has been described in North America and has been recorded in the United States, Europe, and Asia since the early 19th century. Wolves make up about 60% of all mammals and live in the eastern and southeastern United States, and approximately 20% of wolves were listed as living on land between 15 and 30 years ago. The western populations of wolves are considered the largest in North America. In the US, wolf populations have increased recently for the first time since the 1960's, reaching the historic high of 75% in the 1980s.

Although the group stage qualifier against England won off the back of a four-goal campaign by the Reds, it came down to what will undoubtedly be part of Fowler's return to England and the World Cup.","token_len":214,"entropy":[8.9762,2.7338,4.0759,0.3988,4.9917,0.4251,1.5253,0.1743,11.6244,1.4433,3.6189,0.064,3.5904,3.8236,0.0044,9.9144,1.1732,4.334,0.6918,0.5602,2.8265,9.1068,3.3536,6.9882,15.2335,8.3334,7.1728,4.3578,7.3008,0.7096,4.1628,8.0416,9.565,5.6579,0.549,3.0072,1.7424,4.7226,0.6796,4.7918,0.5886,0.6917,4.6615,3.5659,0.7172,0.0131,4.8784,2.2369,2.7384,3.8361,0.004,3.5502,2.2035,0.6825,0.4275,4.0153,3.9815,0.4394,0.2093,1.7643,4.6527,4.2822,1.0146,4.3865,0.5613,1.5355,6.349,4.6733,3.4293,2.8226,4.9071,2.2727,3.807,0.8779,0.3105,5.0919,1.5404,4.3024,1.3661,3.0121,2.5256,3.1733,0.1264,3.9662,2.0858,4.8102,2.5948,3.0216,0.4627,0.2896,2.9298,0.0144,3.6557,5.3707,0.1187,0.3485,0.2362,3.4366,1.5345,1.548,4.9314,0.5413,0.8985,4.8622,5.0473,1.7673,3.5875,0.2327,2.3779,0.1345,1.318,1.6165,0.0048,2.8829,4.798,3.5576,1.2961,4.0642,0.1722,0.7615,2.5352,2.7592,2.3525,0.098,2.0273,2.0076,4.952,0.1783,3.7408,0.9092,2.0488,0.0081,1.3135,0.0037,1.6142,1.1346,1.9016,5.0786,5.1578,2.5412,4.0111,4.6789,3.0544,1.1738,5.2555,0.6364,0.0016,6.0955,1.9299,2.041,2.3578,0.6077,0.1707,2.2921,3.8217,0.5,3.9378,2.6332,0.7136,1.0611,1.5154,1.4968,1.2173,4.9647,1.7172,2.2661,3.4097,1.2979,5.167,2.3707,0.004,1.0704,5.7847,1.8557,5.664,0.6772,5.8545,1.0589,4.1114,5.3463,4.5077,2.1089,1.046,0.0101,1.3317,5.2953,0.4784,0.7738,5.4628,1.3234,2.2821,4.8391,0.4182,1.9389,4.8428,1.9888,0.014,5.421,5.1933,2.92,0.1176,7.02,0.0839,2.4883,0.0413,3.2836,0.3041,3.3641,4.0303,1.7771,2.8464,0.0071,0.5501]}

A writer from The Guardian criticized the video for 'torturing' the female lead by making fun of the man who worked for her in the play. ''I did feel sorry for those critics who thought that the play was too much a part of the show's development,'' he said. Carey has described the play as'sad and depressing', and said he wants to make a second version, with more explicit scenes. ''I'll probably start filming the third season.'' The final version will be presented with two endings, with one ending set for ''God I Am Not'' on Feb. 13, 2007. Carey would be re-starring alongside his mother, Julie Carey.

With Chelsea relegated from the Premier League in December 2006, Fowler rejoined Liverpool after winning the FA Cup, and subsequently became one of England's most successful managers.","token_len":215,"entropy":[8.9762,2.5467,5.0827,0.4008,12.6215,8.305,0.112,5.4949,3.3328,3.0515,0.8333,3.9736,0.7358,2.1725,0.0799,2.1668,4.9388,1.1594,5.0859,2.1272,0.8687,0.2196,0.0007,0.6208,0.4551,0.4026,3.7371,3.1802,7.4507,2.8777,2.3553,2.1785,5.1819,3.0348,2.7069,2.1445,3.8689,1.3086,4.7589,1.5285,0.9477,5.9148,3.3024,0.3834,0.1299,0.5756,0.0075,1.1858,4.7648,3.904,1.1629,2.4794,4.8356,1.2834,2.3237,0.6045,4.5488,2.5123,0.2757,2.5798,5.1704,5.912,4.3271,2.2415,0.9691,5.0336,0.0685,0.0,1.2409,3.3657,4.8668,2.1577,0.0019,5.7073,2.7711,0.0002,0.7315,2.7878,2.4064,3.8995,2.7838,5.4192,4.6524,3.4182,0.9725,10.4308,4.7503,0.0008,0.0,4.7857,2.5029,0.1889,0.2327,0.0029,3.5081,3.1112,0.8559,0.3823,3.8555,0.8521,0.0043,1.4279,3.5565,3.7094,0.0872,0.2379,4.2822,0.0008,0.6083,1.9036,0.0511,0.1474,0.0032,0.7167,0.014,0.0018,0.0037,0.0046,0.0067,0.0027,0.0006,0.0033,0.0077,0.0112,0.0863,0.0163,0.0354,0.0027,0.0024,0.0024,0.0153,0.0042,0.0032,0.0017,0.0592,0.0012,0.0007,0.0015,0.0042,0.0012,0.0054,0.0006,0.0011,0.0021,0.0019,0.0018,0.004,0.0014,0.002,0.0006,0.0007,0.0005,0.0007,0.0135,0.0014,0.0116,0.0007,0.0168,0.0059,0.0022,0.002,0.2397,0.0019,0.0028,0.0001,0.0001,0.0014,0.004,0.0026,0.0011,0.0006,0.001,0.0003,0.0001,0.001,0.0008,0.0062,0.0014,0.0012,0.0073,0.0119,0.0003,2.3047,3.6263,1.3604,0.2163,0.0579,0.3955,0.0036,0.8418,2.8929,0.7856,0.1212,0.0787,1.8655,0.0013,0.6802,4.0766,3.8465,0.7822,1.465,0.0277,2.7598,2.6298,5.3583,2.3256,3.2399,0.009,3.8094,0.0085,0.9237,1.2119,1.069,0.4122]}

On the personal level, his first three feature films,'The World that Wasn't Really Born' (1965),'Reel' (1966), and'The World That Wasn't Really Born' (1973), both feature film franchises and also feature films with strong female elements. He was also involved in the early days of the 'Daft Punk' revival, and on and off for many years thereafter. However, it is interesting to ponder the current state of Szab\u00f3's career with regards to film: Szab\u00f3 first started production of films in 1993 but had only finished a single film, with 'Dirty Money' which fell into one of those two categories. As a result, he was forced to pull away from the film franchise for many years, though he continued developing it into a complete work, and later did release 'The D\u00fchringen Project' as a complete work under his own studio banner.","token_len":216,"entropy":[11.6753,7.77,6.3533,0.5451,12.428,3.9469,0.7282,12.6381,7.4253,7.3832,9.5127,1.4214,3.2753,4.4853,3.4089,0.9187,1.1954,4.6712,0.0915,1.4532,7.6931,0.4911,0.4519,2.3464,6.3033,5.2314,1.2629,5.0918,0.7722,3.8045,1.0958,0.2282,6.3208,5.6709,5.6867,5.4806,0.2465,11.148,5.2701,5.6197,5.5859,3.1286,2.7194,0.0253,5.7126,4.0382,1.0905,0.9157,4.2871,0.5735,2.7678,6.7612,4.158,3.2989,0.0446,1.3391,0.5708,1.2696,0.3669,1.4227,3.1285,0.7782,0.2916,0.3188,0.0015,0.1972,0.1355,0.1939,0.0822,2.6026,0.7373,3.1757,2.1437,4.7191,5.1154,2.8968,4.6941,1.3011,1.4152,3.0877,3.7286,3.2739,5.617,0.5237,2.9118,3.1304,1.291,2.5865,0.2653,1.2947,3.867,3.9888,0.0327,1.2884,3.2311,5.2675,5.2706,0.0154,0.4716,3.9972,1.3426,2.3706,4.8987,4.2759,0.4062,1.5426,1.8938,0.1182,2.6493,0.393,5.0533,0.0708,3.4814,1.2733,3.222,0.0838,7.8697,1.8732,5.7603,1.3214,0.016,3.8234,0.0528,0.0054,1.2093,1.1028,4.5562,1.705,0.0031,3.1736,4.7575,4.2349,0.0243,0.0042,5.2271,3.5121,6.4191,1.7182,4.2512,0.8082,5.0818,4.898,3.4395,3.0478,3.1452,2.6571,2.7618,1.5509,2.3211,4.8908,3.6125,3.4741,4.4683,4.0083,0.4303,4.2653,5.9036,1.7712,5.5344,0.0953,2.8006,3.1093,0.4119,0.4533,3.7251,1.541,0.6072,0.4431,0.897,1.7911,2.0304,0.1658,4.6254,5.134,0.166,1.3652,2.4524,4.3348,2.843,3.5073,0.105,1.2652,4.3,1.2255,1.9805,5.4453,2.1331,2.3139,1.1857,4.9661,2.3614,2.2429,2.2356,3.9409,4.7395,4.9015,2.8942,1.6511,5.1144,4.9649,2.3918,0.9212,3.0457,4.7078,0.6371,2.9312,0.914,4.4989,1.3653,4.8996,1.2409,0.7382,5.6974,4.8935,0.5975]}

The line was initially divided in half with half the lines having straight lines across the city center, and the other half having horizontal lines across the center lines. In order to maintain the original orientation of the line, all other stops and lines of the line have been cut down and each stop now has a different angle. This can give the alignment of the four new interchanges that have been established.

If any one of those two interchanges were to collapse under the weight of another, it would probably cause the lines to be reversed and the alignment of the lines to the opposite direction reversed.

The project also recently started a community effort where users can offer to share their opinions about the project through an online exchange or forum.\n\nAs a solution, the community effort aims to help people keep updating the site with new features and information, which will change the user experience, and help prevent the sites from becoming deinstitutionalized again.\n\n<k>\n\n<l>","token_len":217,"entropy":[12.0331,4.0911,9.1117,10.4365,6.0469,5.0067,4.6304,1.7356,1.4958,3.64,2.1255,1.0843,6.7948,7.8211,5.1997,0.8254,1.3819,4.1119,3.7736,0.5629,3.6648,0.6366,5.8287,2.4683,10.1569,10.5098,6.799,5.3195,9.69,6.6623,8.1955,13.0664,6.203,4.4037,8.2021,3.8793,9.8458,1.7646,2.4793,3.2363,2.3107,5.2108,0.1554,3.6571,4.5796,4.6272,1.0812,4.7756,1.8647,1.2185,0.0147,1.7453,3.9535,1.8871,4.6938,0.2103,4.106,1.7021,0.8936,0.8461,3.3085,1.516,5.0657,1.2676,2.6099,1.8784,5.2018,4.1875,6.3779,5.9228,2.0593,2.4354,1.0854,1.545,0.0003,4.493,5.2079,4.0291,4.1942,4.9781,2.717,3.5704,1.2514,3.6977,3.5789,1.3422,5.5342,0.0011,4.6475,4.4561,0.1622,2.4316,1.2452,3.2659,1.1725,1.0467,0.4872,4.1492,4.5905,3.6004,2.2091,1.3675,3.5188,4.1664,1.7083,1.345,1.9943,0.5357,0.6173,0.0002,1.9826,3.8972,2.3474,4.9362,3.4528,0.7722,0.7198,2.5599,3.2299,4.9523,1.3376,1.6952,2.8502,0.0035,1.6014,4.827,0.0883,2.9817,3.599,1.5037,3.159,3.4078,4.6628,0.5204,1.4555,2.1544,0.3601,3.1047,2.7771,2.2392,4.9728,3.7183,2.2038,4.3037,2.971,4.6867,1.0384,0.428,5.1597,2.9888,4.8763,0.8338,5.2193,2.3064,0.5913,0.7082,4.3966,3.2382,1.6033,4.8922,3.8686,2.9702,0.212,0.3363,0.0002,4.7384,2.7859,5.4591,0.4658,1.1931,4.6006,4.4979,3.18,0.0504,3.9932,3.0033,4.8656,6.2488,1.0005,1.2103,1.7838,0.5674,0.8286,1.2144,5.1132,2.0935,3.3041,1.812,6.3033,0.6222,3.6267,0.2654,3.4687,2.5888,2.735,4.2824,2.7161,5.6184,0.2836,1.3211,5.0943,7.6631,1.5475,0.0826,4.877,0.1271,0.4514,0.0002,3.1689,5.8383,0.8395,3.862,0.0002,1.0131,4.2865,0.1977]}

The temperature exceeded the record global mean with an average of 13.1 \u00b0 C (25 \u00b0 F) in April, 2015. With temperatures approaching the new record, there is an opportunity for further dramatic changes in the world's temperature system. This report will go in conjunction with the publication of global temperature record temperature data from Chile, Bolivia, Paraguay, and New Zealand, together with observations of new seasonal warming trends in Antarctica. To this end, I will explain how temperature variability can be caused by multiple factors with different degrees of independence from one another. Please note: the following graph shows a large variation in the change in the average temperature over the last 30+ days, including changes in recent years, during the period 2014-2015. The colors will approximate change, so there is a change in the temperature difference between 2014 and 2015.","token_len":218,"entropy":[1.9909,1.5,8.467,9.216,0.0506,0.6143,2.5267,2.5682,5.9959,1.1815,0.1068,2.1557,4.0437,2.3037,8.5966,2.9276,3.3445,5.831,0.8794,0.187,1.372,6.74,3.6889,2.5153,8.3232,0.0001,3.0061,7.3653,13.7122,6.2513,7.7347,7.1589,4.2877,3.5027,2.726,4.166,0.4819,0.1086,0.7667,2.0076,3.3687,4.9467,3.2594,3.6252,1.8169,1.5234,0.7585,2.9435,0.6154,1.9045,2.0905,5.1211,0.7813,2.2121,6.1007,2.7411,5.3596,1.7119,0.5106,0.5622,4.9227,0.7987,3.0831,0.4801,0.7131,0.3551,3.7448,1.0736,0.015,0.8272,2.07,4.4463,2.5634,1.8736,0.3892,6.0533,2.8136,3.6,1.2288,4.1816,0.2511,2.1121,3.8324,1.1551,2.9628,2.2949,0.6918,3.8095,5.1956,1.4882,0.8528,0.7436,3.2429,0.7272,1.8893,2.4648,0.7131,3.7688,4.4086,2.2018,5.5853,3.7087,4.3432,0.0059,0.9294,5.601,0.1549,6.0834,1.1512,2.9963,6.04,1.2761,2.328,4.8319,1.3796,3.6213,0.4272,3.2343,0.001,0.271,1.6643,5.8471,0.099,1.923,4.5139,0.0865,3.2939,1.4734,4.7261,5.3829,5.7151,2.3372,1.3747,3.1646,1.2831,5.5993,5.1415,0.0812,0.1189,3.2459,1.6943,4.8268,1.5283,4.4637,4.0258,2.7426,1.1162,5.2029,0.1207,4.5668,0.8359,5.822,2.0442,2.5228,0.0506,4.0185,2.3121,0.8667,0.0332,0.5472,5.9534,1.3301,2.4553,2.4844,3.577,4.5276,1.5896,3.1435,5.581,3.2833,0.3169,0.8746,5.1376,0.2793,1.4697,2.9951,0.7536,2.0907,0.6195,0.981,2.6623,5.4228,3.2803,2.1506,4.2915,3.1686,0.436,5.7038,1.1943,1.9215,4.4214,0.7624,2.3814,4.8718,0.355,1.0855,0.4131,1.452,5.2125,6.3307,5.5747,5.683,3.9842,2.9254,3.8844,0.7057,1.1217,4.88,0.5292,0.8283,3.4499,4.52,1.1914,3.0838,0.6061,0.1148,0.4338]}

In some ways, we're lucky with the price tags: The company's first venture, the K-12 theater for students in Seattle, drew about $450,000,000 in sales for its opening costs last year.

As researchers discovered after conducting this research, click trains have three important effects on the evolution of oceanic currents, namely: 1) they influence the speed of eel populations that rely on it to survive; 2) they drive up and speed up their larvae, thereby making them more reproductively adapted to our daily lives\u2014especially larvae of eels which use this fast feeding; and 3) they can be used in a variety of applications, notably as acoustic weapons against predatory insects.

The company was granted the right for the tracks in April, 1865, as part of a compensation award from Governor Sherman for his patronage of the railroad.\n\nThe railroad is located in Santa Leon de Los Angeles on the Southern Pacific Railway Highway between Sacramento and Sacramento and Santa Cruz, and is the world's first super-long track. On January 4, 1871, President Polk signed the Southern Pacific Railway Act of 1862 requiring trackage to be fixed with a minimum price, of 500,000 feet per mile per year. As a result more than 80 feet of the tracks in the Pacific were permanently owned by the company. In 1886, the Los Angeles County railroad company acquired the rights from the Southern Pacific, and to that date the tracks have been used for 45 million miles.","token_len":219,"entropy":[7.8214,9.8897,0.2036,0.9385,2.8562,7.2331,3.6612,14.2835,8.1667,6.6954,4.6483,5.4896,1.1701,5.805,3.7977,3.5902,5.3013,6.372,5.2517,3.854,3.8028,0.354,4.8458,3.654,1.3902,4.142,3.9801,9.0013,13.2448,6.7371,5.2311,7.388,4.1434,1.9317,3.7796,1.6731,1.7219,1.7995,5.7207,0.8097,2.0621,3.0766,2.9269,4.1837,1.831,0.0294,0.1492,5.4296,2.6876,0.744,4.891,0.4032,1.3903,1.1061,0.2329,1.7691,3.9399,0.2934,0.2374,0.0887,0.0935,0.5183,1.536,4.6867,2.5721,4.7108,1.4784,1.6468,4.2248,1.3219,5.6417,3.5705,5.0678,2.1131,5.9887,0.5004,4.1299,1.4018,0.0011,1.171,4.9886,6.6004,3.0639,4.4574,5.2614,2.5765,2.0399,4.7776,0.3908,0.4415,2.9713,0.6541,1.4163,0.0035,1.4487,3.9557,4.154,3.7992,1.2657,2.3037,9.1157,4.7392,3.218,0.1471,3.7945,0.5034,3.9412,0.1973,4.7081,4.7811,1.477,5.5427,0.3106,3.4385,3.1212,4.3364,2.4218,1.1136,1.9694,1.4304,3.2397,3.297,0.0317,3.386,5.3592,1.3354,3.1858,1.6195,1.3759,5.4388,3.0879,3.3298,0.054,1.224,3.9164,0.0885,4.256,3.6578,1.4176,0.8123,3.0821,0.0889,0.7149,0.9328,1.9653,2.3661,4.1918,4.5382,0.3712,2.3592,0.3783,4.3603,5.1278,1.6781,3.6511,4.2668,4.2168,4.5035,6.9522,1.4803,0.0635,3.0172,0.8621,1.5443,2.0536,0.2994,0.7981,4.4057,1.6666,0.6213,8.2371,0.206,4.2172,6.3149,0.1787,3.8523,1.9309,3.8083,0.8729,3.0235,1.3989,4.4785,4.0633,0.5189,0.5822,1.986,0.8422,2.935,4.4027,0.3463,0.9592,3.607,0.0107,1.7812,5.6261,3.5618,3.585,0.7291,2.1771,3.2853,0.7257,1.8981,0.0114,3.4303,0.9424,5.5969,3.5418,1.2097,1.2856,2.6758,0.7336,0.5365,3.3004,1.5748,5.7882,3.7494,0.369,1.4208]}

The book demonstrates how these principles of safe and responsible behaviour have been understood in social and cultural terms, and that in their time, a sense of self-understanding is needed.\n\nStigma has become a powerful motivator and is the most important factor for people to protect their identities, and this is reflected in the attitudes people hold towards victims and the victims' rights organisations. The problem of fear and stigma is not new. In the US, fear of exposure to a perceived threat has since been the second most important factor behind identity theft: an increase in reporting by the FBI. As a result more people report being afraid than to report it, according to this report from the US National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). The NCVS found that the number of people fearing being stalked decreased from the 1950s to 1990s.","token_len":221,"entropy":[8.3215,1.464,2.6774,4.4783,8.833,5.5661,5.8643,7.6527,0.3713,0.9981,8.1798,0.1407,9.4981,0.705,5.7932,2.645,10.039,0.9351,5.2519,2.108,4.414,4.334,4.1107,3.2284,1.6812,5.6427,1.5328,7.7503,0.6656,8.6911,6.1686,1.547,2.2342,4.3691,6.8146,0.1352,3.7033,7.2225,5.3431,2.6146,3.1591,1.0848,5.7193,5.5649,2.2103,5.1963,0.9526,4.4132,1.4888,0.0808,0.2104,2.5134,0.9121,5.5602,0.9783,4.1982,4.7052,2.414,6.1493,2.3041,2.1997,4.4772,4.3248,1.2041,5.0014,2.1615,5.3065,2.5891,1.4305,2.5586,1.6137,1.0534,4.236,4.1833,3.8036,5.3925,1.0175,4.6906,3.4658,0.0261,2.5212,0.7796,4.6047,0.0487,1.9061,3.1865,1.3891,1.4377,0.0389,3.3813,0.2552,3.0434,2.5842,0.8834,4.2144,4.8909,0.001,3.1253,3.8657,3.3817,2.8529,1.9724,2.3158,2.8291,2.7932,0.5335,5.1378,0.8559,0.5495,2.4622,2.2394,3.6968,1.3584,2.6844,0.1355,0.9276,5.1641,2.7788,3.4168,1.4444,5.7108,1.775,2.9345,5.6266,0.5367,4.5003,5.1974,0.4034,2.3012,5.552,1.2798,5.8506,1.2414,2.4468,1.3647,3.1638,2.6329,1.5898,2.1141,1.2908,3.5261,0.5162,3.0084,0.9105,5.8063,0.6795,3.3946,3.7406,1.0586,1.5815,6.4396,0.9437,3.6712,5.8601,0.6709,1.8626,0.7388,3.4251,5.256,0.5229,4.6209,4.9779,2.1909,0.0622,5.4257,3.591,1.6904,1.6036,1.8484,4.237,1.5859,0.256,7.6676,1.0155,2.7089,2.1491,3.1319,3.3462,3.2929,0.5605,2.2637,1.5032,4.594,0.0013,5.3361,2.1271,2.0079,0.5123,3.2729,1.7222,1.1802,0.2413,0.1659,0.0935,1.3247,1.4916,0.055,0.8025,2.2018,1.0446,0.0002,3.4398,0.1527,2.6293,2.2495,0.0203,1.2432,6.4463,2.3777,2.8201,0.0002,4.5609,0.9288,3.993,5.2826,0.0688,0.3135,3.0184,0.0708,1.2112]}

The first of Mathews' expeditions, his own in 2001, was the second on the continent and was the only one that involved humans. The first expedition involved the first humans on land, while the second involved the second humans traveling on foot after coming across a bush covered by fire. The three expeditions took place less than three months apart and took place between December and January, 2009. The first expedition involved a person with two heads, with one body and the other head covered with debris on a beach at Mwoainibutu, the nearest island. The second expedition involved a man with a long tail, more like a deer in the shade with a long tail. These three expeditions are thought to have brought Mathews from Guinea to the continent.

Donaldson thought Giger was the best man for the film after reading his compendium Necronomicon. Giger says that in the movie, aliens are so much better at manipulating technology than ours did. Giger has also been using an elaborate design to create creatures that resemble humans. The first two creatures are described as using an array of advanced telekinetic abilities. Giger also claims that they have the strongest heart of any humanoid, and that they have four teeth, giving them the characteristics of human, and that the creature's brain is composed of energy. On top of all that, he also boasts that their anatomy is so advanced that it could even live into the future with humans. A few of the creatures may have long since left our solar system, as Giger claims that they will no longer exist in space or anywhere else, though they can still live in our solar system, and that they are not yet living on Earth, meaning that there is no way to know.\n","token_len":223,"entropy":[6.1855,8.4107,2.2888,6.7328,4.5389,4.558,1.9303,4.476,0.3486,3.9016,3.6922,1.6603,0.8837,2.9901,2.2178,0.9368,8.4341,2.2732,1.4196,6.7533,2.4003,0.4462,10.2341,2.2796,7.2282,4.548,0.0009,2.1786,2.4542,2.4224,4.7724,1.5542,0.5425,7.2862,6.4571,6.2129,1.1767,10.3027,0.1084,10.6702,1.3075,0.0771,0.0083,1.4112,1.8434,0.0005,4.919,1.117,4.3731,1.5191,2.921,0.9503,3.421,1.4618,4.658,3.0016,3.554,2.151,3.7102,5.9437,0.6119,6.4107,4.8384,0.6914,2.4829,0.0011,3.9714,2.1657,2.5229,4.7782,4.596,4.7912,3.9459,1.8813,1.9086,3.0728,1.1112,1.8331,2.8279,0.8404,2.9928,3.7246,4.1661,1.84,2.2674,3.4407,0.355,5.864,3.5633,5.0509,0.007,5.5801,5.4467,1.02,0.0581,1.8206,1.2683,1.8922,0.0009,2.7884,3.3206,0.3803,2.8335,2.1914,2.2117,5.8252,5.6814,1.7219,0.6727,3.2129,2.3608,1.4022,1.5511,0.9371,1.8796,5.9702,5.4082,2.091,5.5702,0.1588,1.3663,6.5108,0.1164,2.1675,4.1423,2.1666,1.8861,2.9413,2.9513,1.6911,3.7799,0.7186,3.1966,0.2621,5.5954,0.8157,6.0337,2.5323,0.0047,2.1864,0.9399,0.1029,3.0935,2.6305,5.9071,0.5761,3.7605,4.8192,0.6757,2.4936,2.6009,0.3928,1.652,2.1481,3.2806,4.811,5.9948,1.0064,1.1479,4.3853,3.3546,0.4682,5.1171,3.4238,1.7675,0.7185,0.8204,5.45,1.6173,5.3777,2.9297,3.6314,3.4324,2.1963,0.0133,0.7143,3.7993,1.9399,0.0006,1.9874,0.8237,1.2265,3.063,4.5812,0.0454,2.4343,1.759,3.8386,3.0723,5.8813,0.5612,2.4079,3.2401,1.7072,3.5308,0.4621,3.2254,1.1911,1.8311,1.3457,0.0128,3.1348,1.7094,1.7097,1.0185,1.964,3.4269,4.0296,4.7575,1.6625,0.951,2.8273,5.5001,0.4242,3.3383,1.0323,0.9697,1.9658,1.0769,2.5547,3.2428,1.3443]}

In 2011, Nevada's state sales tax alone netted $8 billion, giving it the record highest tax rate in the US, which included the estate tax.\nIn the new laws, owners will be able to bring in more than $6 million to pay for their new premises.\nNew casino construction starts in November 2018.","token_len":227,"entropy":[6.774,1.3627,0.8274,3.7148,11.1248,2.0017,5.0118,6.3744,0.7269,1.4962,6.9138,1.4383,8.0769,10.2031,0.6529,8.6408,0.6445,1.8096,2.3564,7.0564,0.0935,9.6091,0.0019,3.616,2.991,4.8049,0.9455,7.5708,5.1195,0.6321,1.9007,3.179,1.8547,6.4642,3.5284,1.9695,0.0986,4.6641,0.0198,3.6922,0.8851,5.2758,0.3352,0.3084,0.8678,10.4084,1.4357,2.8785,5.6432,0.475,1.3387,3.5705,4.8379,2.9466,4.1908,1.8753,6.2483,4.098,5.0185,1.3951,4.0418,1.4644,0.3473,3.577,1.2209,2.3272,1.6103,0.9087,3.8257,3.9478,1.1754,3.2687,1.2436,0.0732,3.5117,1.3334,5.6937,3.6582,0.36,4.1528,0.3743,4.4984,0.1954,1.1086,4.3442,4.2861,3.6282,3.7444,5.9315,3.4066,5.0563,4.5309,1.1023,1.6321,2.7344,4.1884,0.1201,1.7756,1.0044,4.644,5.528,2.6158,0.0623,5.49,2.9996,4.1973,5.6548,2.0214,3.3206,2.1227,3.435,0.7605,3.4059,0.6579,3.3176,0.6342,1.5649,0.8472,4.8515,4.3238,7.0451,2.3604,0.6476,2.5877,2.3977,0.0092,0.3162,3.6229,4.9043,0.087,1.0776,3.1655,1.4588,2.1992,2.19,2.2878,5.5052,0.7517,1.742,5.2069,0.1766,3.1739,1.1858,2.2078,2.0345,0.5226,0.5233,3.4394,0.674,2.5243,2.1738,3.6115,1.2545,4.4562,2.6428,0.1176,3.5452,0.1094,4.2822,0.3569,0.3312,2.4775,4.5878,0.9243,3.4389,1.9352,3.2928,3.5265,0.0644,3.9391,5.3825,1.4274,3.6549,1.6066,1.0809,5.0541,1.6253,1.1841,6.15,2.6556,2.4434,0.5848,0.6182,0.0838,2.1465,2.5676,3.7029,5.9635,1.8966,5.6107,0.1658,0.9091,0.4747,2.4151,1.9535,5.0819,5.0649,0.5502,6.4557,3.2368,1.0838,1.369,0.019,4.4332,1.0604,3.5735,0.8191,0.2096,4.5139,0.9262,3.0327,1.2031,0.5691,1.6968,2.9202,5.4377,1.3133,1.7656,2.7477,2.7352,5.6045,4.5874,0.9217,3.4519,3.4745,0.8874]}

The judges chose the novel for making the small but vocal contributions to that book's larger historical impact. But many of the novel's most influential characters have long histories that have been woven into the fiction to the point that the story they describe cannot fully convey everything the novel ends on. Robert Conquest's original draft was written without his permission after his wife died of cancer.\n\nThe novel tells the tale of four young men who come from a dysfunctional family but are raised in a supportive, accepting environment. The story becomes so important that people who were raised this way, have become so much more intelligent and driven since the books began with them. A father's desire to find his sons has led to a long journey, and a brother's desire has led him to believe his brother has become less than perfect after decades of being abused by parents, who have never recovered from their abuse. It's never an easy journey but we now know how to make the book less of the tale of abuse than it is.","token_len":229,"entropy":[6.4392,9.7763,1.2137,7.5059,5.887,6.4843,3.1096,9.2354,14.5373,3.2909,5.0873,5.8734,4.5145,1.8493,6.952,0.1515,11.4627,9.1422,4.593,7.2628,0.273,3.6464,2.656,5.0278,6.0785,6.583,3.2293,2.4168,7.1495,4.989,2.3162,4.6076,2.8828,8.7501,1.057,8.9879,3.7282,4.8873,4.7667,1.0909,5.5845,3.2009,1.6378,4.861,5.3637,3.1602,0.5367,5.9364,4.7641,0.973,0.5122,2.5182,0.0669,2.4984,2.9756,2.4869,3.1387,3.5419,4.3376,3.0326,2.3583,1.7229,5.1919,0.339,0.7042,4.7835,4.847,3.5259,0.4595,1.3885,2.267,2.7471,4.9024,4.6001,4.6309,4.7882,2.8753,6.7853,2.8467,1.622,6.09,3.7853,0.4049,5.8136,5.6423,1.6823,6.0249,4.7465,3.3109,4.3536,5.3297,3.4565,1.7808,4.7357,2.1777,2.3557,1.8561,2.9004,1.3442,0.9139,3.7556,0.1388,1.9647,2.0081,4.7629,0.356,2.9193,0.0253,5.1879,2.1606,1.5157,0.9506,4.2925,3.0552,1.1745,4.5177,0.2897,5.3511,2.2889,3.4813,1.9696,0.7814,4.3892,2.0845,4.9267,2.191,0.6758,1.7071,2.2191,5.8196,4.4286,3.1875,1.1274,5.2695,3.2373,3.4818,1.7138,5.1617,0.0136,3.3533,4.8662,2.5176,2.3822,3.8284,0.4329,5.5177,0.8425,5.3644,4.9145,1.5709,5.7762,1.8318,5.7973,1.2643,0.3258,4.2272,4.774,3.2594,4.45,0.2722,4.6508,1.6391,2.9148,3.6954,2.0624,0.9586,1.5525,4.5537,3.2557,2.6315,1.8595,2.4209,4.0976,0.347,1.6602,5.6865,0.4829,1.076,0.2335,4.8019,2.4608,2.4996,2.3725,3.786,4.5584,2.5942,3.1385,4.7436,4.7013,0.0648,3.4317,3.1468,1.3429,5.6115,2.9379,3.2105,1.6928,4.5371,4.9971,0.8843,1.2038,1.3052,0.3244,3.9499,1.5987,6.1201,4.2128,0.1142,0.9306,3.422,4.9418,5.5757,0.6869,2.6143,1.9515,2.0227,1.8026,3.5147,5.4139,3.5248,2.5922,4.4694,0.6362,2.6992,3.9441,1.0945,1.059,1.7659]}

This will be an important milestone, because we currently know what a large solar system can do to the moon and other living creatures like us.\n\nThis solar system will use sunlight to produce electrical power and is expected to be very close to being operational by the end of the century.\n\nThe project is being funded with a $400 million seed round.","token_len":229,"entropy":[11.6242,6.3085,9.0545,0.8324,6.2407,2.5511,4.0948,3.7421,1.6855,2.2416,5.1974,2.4032,3.1275,0.4303,1.6333,1.9551,6.9928,6.1884,4.672,0.1193,0.6049,0.573,4.8426,1.0118,2.0501,0.4913,2.9145,0.4499,3.209,0.2188,9.7015,2.3437,0.8548,6.3529,2.8737,4.1903,1.8821,1.2519,5.4901,0.5499,0.4783,4.5506,1.7798,4.7267,2.2834,2.5248,4.3797,0.0016,4.1675,3.0744,2.3404,2.5101,4.9211,0.627,2.7795,0.7258,1.038,0.0005,5.1684,1.2731,4.3512,0.0206,0.7099,3.6855,6.113,3.0097,3.9493,1.885,4.399,0.9013,1.1473,4.5113,5.3646,0.1564,0.5772,4.7114,3.1529,0.2416,0.9586,2.3359,6.3199,4.5763,1.7528,2.7099,2.0141,5.779,3.0086,0.5267,3.2662,3.5463,2.5485,0.7673,0.0209,0.2743,0.9615,5.8782,3.998,2.0982,2.6163,0.1948,0.7556,2.1485,1.8544,1.5132,0.0036,1.5364,3.0586,3.0858,1.5062,0.6256,2.9644,2.808,2.2936,3.7248,2.5989,2.9082,1.9591,3.8866,2.9701,0.0008,4.7583,0.2013,1.0582,0.0333,0.7013,0.6488,3.9579,2.4571,4.119,3.8703,6.1114,5.3016,0.8656,0.0534,2.1515,0.374,0.3878,0.0002,4.353,4.0542,1.5793,2.8609,3.7753,4.8794,3.0759,1.8918,4.173,2.7298,6.3687,2.3667,2.1666,1.5397,3.6626,2.8524,2.7251,0.9389,3.4185,2.9075,1.7015,3.6226,0.7933,2.1085,2.4281,1.6884,3.4402,4.3712,4.4125,4.9249,2.8588,5.2322,1.5787,0.6573,2.4453,0.731,2.5918,2.6868,6.4486,1.7151,1.8142,6.1684,3.1078,4.5605,0.9422,0.3525,1.1019,0.0002,3.6387,3.5126,0.2085,2.4501,3.62,2.427,0.4581,1.9444,4.4495,0.6251,3.0871,4.6251,1.8824,0.0045,1.5799,3.7924,3.3648,0.0536,2.0794,3.5787,1.0001,1.0002,0.2608,0.0007,0.8595,1.1458,0.2485,1.0961,0.0002,2.202,5.5666,1.3601,2.397,0.7606,3.2848,1.7349,1.3936,5.1029,0.4548,4.1765,0.2879,2.494]}

Helton received a large amount of praise during the 2004 season when the new script'' had been pitched, and there was a suggestion that the ending might have been called'' during the second season.\n\nThe Season 2 finale'' was also called'' by Helton during the third season.","token_len":232,"entropy":[8.8918,3.2209,6.606,3.0872,4.9611,8.8852,0.6285,3.4364,0.4804,2.4967,5.9285,0.0767,1.2719,5.5499,1.2184,4.1622,5.5933,1.9318,1.3329,2.3362,0.0357,5.9798,2.9934,0.9176,1.4047,5.1507,2.691,1.1777,5.0023,3.2554,3.4325,1.4717,0.6088,6.3766,3.2908,2.0446,1.7725,2.9425,2.1191,2.4204,1.7549,3.7337,0.7519,2.9099,1.2797,0.5619,0.4778,2.5573,4.1732,0.3231,2.0256,5.3781,1.7901,5.2196,1.3145,4.2957,4.2707,0.962,1.0289,5.7345,0.0559,3.3402,0.1228,2.9356,3.1247,0.3086,0.8089,0.0006,5.0426,3.0086,0.9742,2.6427,0.9037,0.0002,2.1389,4.9995,6.173,1.6621,3.5856,2.8284,16.5481,3.4141,0.0002,6.2684,2.3389,0.3719,2.3742,3.8655,3.948,1.5924,6.3733,2.5352,1.1725,1.4103,2.4026,8.6123,3.7333,1.6845,2.4849,0.6766,0.2555,4.2157,1.8212,2.4053,0.5796,0.9685,1.0721,1.0546,0.1596,0.401,2.2882,6.3307,4.365,4.5558,3.7304,3.6466,0.5368,2.2735,3.4823,4.7506,2.9527,3.8134,5.009,4.7944,2.8558,5.9082,2.4597,1.6979,5.4289,0.4425,3.2916,1.9702,4.6117,5.502,0.6315,3.6263,4.7512,1.5499,5.3581,2.3186,0.3682,5.698,1.1339,0.7002,2.7933,3.209,5.3045,0.1406,3.9123,1.5708,1.2773,5.7699,0.2651,0.2213,5.3606,1.4854,1.4322,0.2838,2.5816,5.552,0.7155,1.2298,4.1216,5.9556,4.8881,6.0304,4.8686,3.599,1.0353,2.8977,0.3536,3.9622,0.5804,4.7452,0.0022,6.1307,1.1587,4.7973,1.0678,0.0031,3.1855,3.8674,0.3543,5.9801,1.283,3.7117,2.2455,4.9799,5.1587,10.6993,4.14,0.7528,5.9519,2.9309,0.9096,4.9279,0.5663,1.4232,5.2929,0.3741,1.2523,5.6791,2.7285,2.0495,0.5909,5.604,2.5851,6.2756,0.475,2.3325,0.118,1.4879,1.6089,0.0001,1.6964,4.966,2.636,1.5166,3.9667,1.2249,3.5888,2.1247,1.1136,3.7295,3.8319,0.0036,3.1252,0.4123,2.3527,0.0747,1.9101]}

As the city is becoming increasingly well-developed and urbanized, it has increasingly looked at the arts \u2014 arts that are becoming more accessible to all ages \u2014 as a natural extension of its cultural and geographic landscape and a potential boon for local businesses.

The player has said that while he will keep Swan as his manager, he is \"not in favour of having another coaching job\" in Adelaide.","token_len":244,"entropy":[8.0333,4.5138,0.1511,11.0977,10.5945,6.8036,3.3121,0.3934,2.6076,1.538,3.6563,1.5274,10.5717,11.933,4.3673,6.4753,7.5309,0.8414,1.4288,0.6359,3.9171,1.6453,0.0737,4.4431,1.6085,6.2062,2.3566,6.0385,0.2491,3.6546,3.0674,1.6696,0.0123,1.7501,0.8718,0.0021,2.1856,2.6911,1.9327,0.1627,1.6072,2.9636,3.9501,0.06,3.6519,1.3045,3.93,2.9233,1.7111,1.6406,4.8731,4.6343,0.0514,2.5113,1.5927,3.3005,0.0027,1.1258,3.8111,2.4804,5.585,0.0985,4.5719,4.1969,0.6892,1.5387,4.6653,1.1322,1.6677,5.1774,2.9677,0.9514,5.3767,1.6868,4.2298,0.0962,0.5695,4.2972,0.6981,3.3652,2.5138,3.0044,0.1488,0.9944,2.5596,5.6814,1.93,0.8558,3.1128,4.8562,0.0018,0.0,0.0002,0.0004,0.0002,0.0002,0.0009,1.7252,6.5334,0.5639,0.7291,3.9718,2.5584,1.7217,4.0822,5.3574,0.522,5.6235,2.1084,0.642,4.4659,3.7299,0.7749,5.7156,0.7658,2.3458,0.4886,0.5795,0.0002,3.8635,3.6479,0.0021,0.3968,3.4608,0.0016,0.0031,4.6458,1.808,3.6235,2.852,0.0514,5.5246,5.4259,5.0324,0.9519,5.6419,5.5819,4.3268,0.0248,3.3798,1.2403,1.3519,0.8339,2.2172,0.2973,2.4559,1.9214,3.9471,3.9777,1.0134,5.9603,1.9692,4.8759,3.8655,1.6034,1.9839,0.0002,1.7861,2.8009,3.1118,0.0759,1.1427,3.0489,0.0111,0.002,4.0637,2.0829,3.105,0.2801,2.843,0.5096,3.8934,0.3475,1.1952,0.3747,3.8982,1.787,1.8651,2.4631,1.625,0.9298,2.0622,3.2899,5.1402,2.8001,1.965,0.3419,0.9097,0.6252,0.3979,0.9396,0.0002,1.982,2.6628,0.0051,0.0028,2.543,3.1558,1.7895,3.5158,1.696,1.0656,6.0998,2.9062,1.1818,3.525,0.4676,5.4871,0.8784,4.566,1.9005,0.0368,0.4279,0.568,2.6018,5.2201,2.9151,3.9834,1.8083,4.1035,0.6219,2.6763,4.4528,4.1858,2.3852,1.5595,2.2593,0.4325,0.571,2.0202,2.8921,1.4969,3.3429,2.1354,0.8899,4.1054,3.8084,5.6656,1.5737,2.4125,2.2787,4.7833,0.4192]}

The USS Abraham Lincoln, a nuclear carrier launched into harm's way while fighting Japan in the Pacific during World War II, sank and sank the USS Carl Vinson in World War II. It was the largest air attack on Japanese bases ever. World War II was fought with the intent to invade Japan with the use of atomic weapons. Japan were attacked and lost a war on 9th June 1945. More than half a billion Japanese people were evacuated through the streets to safety before the Japanese military stormed Japan, making Japan Japan's second smallest sovereign nation. There was peace until the end and war was ended soon afterwards during the Japanese surrender. The World War II Battle of Okinawa, Japan, is one of those legendary events which has led many to believe some of the most famous American military acts of the Cold War are in any way in violation of Constitution.

This is also a test on the effectiveness of the new public transport, with a focus on performance of the infrastructure for use as a primary means of transport. The third test is the test of how the public transport system will perform in real-life situations.

Later on in the season, conditions are cooler featuring mild afternoons, and evenings are sunny. Seasonal conditions tend to be mild on the colder end of the spectrum because of the lower snowfall and less precipitation, although those conditions seem to vary a lot between time periods as well. The following is an overview of winter days in the season during different periods. During summer and fall the conditions for winter are mild, and the winter nights and early mornings are mild and quiet. Early, and early in the year, the conditions are slightly mild with few major storms causing more than one storm per year; early in the season for instance, temperatures are slightly warmed with less rainfall. The weather in autumn may be more variable by the time of a large storm or cold while in the spring and early summer weather is mild but warm and sunny.

{"id":3691,"ended":true,"length":225,"gen_text":"There is dispute in medievalist circles over the size of the war horse, with some notable historians claiming a size of 17 to 18 hands ( 68 to 72 inches, 173 to 183 centimeters ), but the size of the bull's head differs somewhat ( 6.35 to 6.75 inches, 1.3 to 1.8 cm ).\n\nAn interesting finding in Medieval literature is that the German War Horse is used as a military training horse for infantry or cavalry. During the Second World War during the early 1940s, the Germans had much less war horses than they used to during the Second World War, but this did not stop the use of the German horse in defense of European states. This fact also suggests that the German horse was used by Allied forces fighting with Japan during the Second World War, which is supported by later research.\n\nMany more examples can be found in the U.S. military history collections, including several large collections organized by rank and division, and a history of the Battle of Walla Walla in Germany using the Battle of Walla Walla, published some 20 years later by the Army's Division of Training, 7th Infantry Division in 1914. A similar battle battle was in Italy.","token_len":245,"entropy":[2.8744,11.1144,2.9573,9.2268,8.1165,2.2051,1.8517,1.6041,6.5991,0.1569,0.5707,6.9417,7.9827,1.4552,3.4404,1.3362,8.8647,3.6669,2.0596,4.0077,5.2816,0.4919,5.3575,2.8238,1.497,7.2018,3.297,14.4147,2.4863,3.2558,3.1119,2.5817,7.7478,0.4071,4.5546,1.7045,5.2532,2.4724,2.205,4.0588,0.3329,0.4706,5.9027,2.4178,1.6286,5.1501,4.123,2.5603,4.8179,2.0993,5.0372,0.5595,1.398,0.0777,2.5516,0.7295,1.2636,3.574,0.4259,3.6158,0.2471,1.0411,0.0442,2.2696,1.6041,1.8774,2.1153,0.1571,5.1582,2.7759,5.3298,1.6695,3.978,4.5079,0.5792,1.089,1.1663,5.3291,5.1173,0.1716,2.1238,5.3004,1.8167,0.4731,4.134,6.1956,0.9866,1.9843,3.9012,4.6487,0.2892,1.4368,4.8039,0.3137,3.3244,0.0543,0.0004,6.3407,0.5819,3.6014,4.3447,0.2189,0.629,1.293,3.2115,3.1519,5.7808,3.0614,5.0526,0.8766,0.6192,1.6791,3.5731,1.2039,3.6638,0.3187,2.1784,0.0766,0.0006,1.6821,1.6438,2.9337,2.8489,0.0529,0.9136,1.328,3.0671,0.0442,1.1528,1.0951,2.5516,1.6677,6.2738,0.6687,4.8119,4.5272,0.788,3.8714,3.7197,3.9324,3.2266,0.1716,0.802,1.1158,1.2904,0.9492,1.6503,2.2315,5.1004,1.0033,5.9176,4.0266,5.5785,1.2666,0.6252,1.2626,0.0261,0.0004,1.5599,2.7495,2.3902,4.7115,0.0527,5.0012,3.3996,1.2652,0.683,0.0002,5.2376,5.649,2.9002,2.8766,0.0163,0.0865,0.4903,0.9194,5.9647,0.0684,0.0405,0.1901,2.4432,1.7911,4.2507,1.7898,1.3886,4.7722,5.3958,3.0481,6.1346,0.4494,4.7926,0.6363,5.8001,1.8604,1.9808,2.9197,6.0591,0.209,0.7566,3.842,0.0576,5.5265,3.8278,0.0013,0.0046,2.3048,2.4339,7.0104,0.6541,2.1287,0.173,0.9697,0.0703,0.5295,0.0138,2.5186,5.6192,7.4249,3.1793,0.0722,1.6604,1.9927,0.8283,3.4274,3.1749,4.6648,0.1357,5.3209,2.2826,5.7972,0.1506,1.3584,0.5444,2.9383,5.0024,0.339,4.1771,3.8303,4.3774,5.3539,1.7223,4.5264,4.3257,3.9127]}

Nonetheless motorists, with their vehicles moving, did observe an increase in traffic around Hope, with the traffic still making a considerable effort to cross the water line into the surrounding city.\n\nThis incident can be considered to be some sort of a case where traffic will go on, and there is no indication at this time that light truck drivers will be doing anything very much about it.\n\nMotorists can make a great number of comments on the matter regarding this situation on Twitter.","token_len":246,"entropy":[9.0373,3.9814,1.1805,10.456,4.5766,2.8122,5.2097,3.9799,1.4914,3.1787,3.1554,4.5876,2.7806,5.3962,1.3684,4.2561,2.0554,4.4908,1.3949,4.8924,2.3295,4.7897,5.6483,6.695,0.6474,1.436,9.0914,0.2074,3.6551,0.4724,2.1025,6.5831,1.9204,5.1127,0.349,2.1267,0.8343,5.7482,0.5385,4.8499,3.3001,4.8087,1.2444,6.4125,2.4407,3.146,2.5615,1.1446,1.7972,1.4059,2.635,1.1664,2.7073,0.0782,1.9315,0.4892,3.5932,6.0276,1.4596,2.2319,3.8966,4.2536,4.6217,3.8798,5.8796,5.3413,5.2185,6.1467,0.0992,0.623,4.5827,5.3139,1.5987,2.7462,0.7445,4.0728,3.5186,0.0439,1.7338,4.9514,1.9019,0.5951,0.0131,0.132,0.7271,0.0089,4.9233,3.3316,5.1956,3.6422,5.368,0.5336,1.0345,1.3341,2.403,2.6039,4.1154,2.061,5.6765,4.9269,4.6227,2.1194,1.9021,5.8936,3.0331,2.2349,3.4383,0.1337,2.8516,3.6619,0.9374,7.2921,5.3337,3.5412,0.5479,1.4135,4.9642,5.6195,1.7126,1.4534,5.2848,1.9154,1.9686,2.2483,4.6717,1.3791,3.9124,1.7258,4.5949,1.3214,4.886,2.0098,3.2445,5.7619,6.2404,0.8223,5.4477,0.7478,1.4262,2.0212,2.6636,1.699,1.1783,2.035,2.2294,5.8343,3.7266,1.434,0.4467,5.6399,5.6353,4.4682,3.5243,1.3016,3.1795,3.4311,2.5944,3.7626,5.7985,4.0195,1.1658,0.0947,0.8965,4.5895,3.7653,2.0331,1.9294,1.9758,2.7705,5.0855,5.0662,1.5061,4.9067,2.5072,0.1019,2.5117,0.4419,6.3139,3.4462,4.0578,1.0497,5.3892,4.1136,0.5963,0.7433,0.0002,3.3925,5.119,5.211,0.4758,2.9376,2.2665,0.2262,5.485,0.9285,0.0008,4.0031,4.4504,3.4988,2.3344,4.7306,4.2879,2.6926,4.0564,1.9326,3.3187,1.3561,1.3194,2.2546,3.4203,0.3729,0.47,0.6062,5.5457,2.0847,0.808,1.927,0.7303,4.1319,0.9227,5.9817,3.6824,2.9327,0.2664,0.2382,1.6884,0.0003,5.5066,0.2008,3.8074,3.9414,1.7784,3.5303,4.0982,0.018,3.6734,1.4091,1.0961,2.9453,3.3432,1.8397,2.6173,3.5769,2.2165,2.0358]}
{"id":1868,"ended":true,"length":239,"gen_text":"Since the beginning of river commerce and industrial development in the 1800s, the Missouri has been severely polluted and its water quality degraded by human activity. Most of the river's floodplain habitat has been over-explored by humans since 1889 and natural disasters have been associated with these ecological disturbances. In Missouri River Basin, Missouri River Basin is the world's largest river in the Columbia River basin. When river basin water levels have exceeded river basin boundaries and water management of rivers have fallen and its soils have suffered over time since the beginning of the 18th century, rivers flow at a greater variability, but are generally in equilibrium with normal river conditions. The natural consequences of natural disasters and natural phenomena are the largest and most destructive because they can cause large disturbances to water quality, including large rainfall floods, inundation of vegetation or irrigation disturbance. Natural phenomena also cause large disturbances to ecosystem function in the natural water supplies in the valley. The natural disturbances are large, but also occur in some places near and far from river banks. As rivers, there are natural disturbances associated with the river's flow, and so some of the water quality problems associated with natural phenomena, such as in the flooding of natural resources, will become less severe in future.","token_len":246,"entropy":[2.3024,4.7307,0.2422,13.1112,8.2241,3.5946,5.2183,2.5202,1.6955,0.9387,5.0341,0.1754,0.3159,1.6716,7.9429,7.124,1.3652,7.4078,3.8761,2.4272,3.931,2.6159,1.4963,5.3054,1.8212,4.4961,1.3694,0.5279,5.5791,0.8095,0.2646,2.599,0.8583,6.9974,1.7062,6.0145,1.3102,0.1537,5.8641,0.9515,2.6196,3.1884,1.5878,3.7776,3.9522,6.6822,2.403,5.4551,3.115,0.751,3.107,3.2762,0.0217,4.2782,5.0439,3.3194,0.2472,2.5912,4.3683,3.097,1.9067,0.7094,4.6622,0.5977,1.4864,2.1134,1.6799,2.9925,0.0256,0.5752,1.8777,3.6629,2.5032,4.764,0.1848,1.0148,0.8752,6.1025,3.4633,4.3078,2.5786,1.247,3.6886,2.8022,5.1401,2.6761,4.4049,2.6758,3.4782,5.5479,5.8102,2.5967,2.0407,5.3923,4.9409,5.4807,5.7936,1.4437,4.9621,4.8825,2.5441,5.7969,0.8934,2.165,0.0094,1.0328,2.7474,0.0187,0.0549,0.1043,3.5994,4.9037,4.5393,1.2342,5.5579,7.6977,3.6319,4.247,2.8316,3.5535,3.4353,3.1103,1.3359,6.2546,1.1183,3.6704,0.2961,1.9099,4.187,5.6328,0.0886,3.2753,1.1358,1.9477,2.8146,4.1638,1.966,4.0345,4.6844,2.6208,0.2886,3.7253,5.9391,0.8166,3.0619,2.287,3.853,5.1289,1.9476,3.5645,1.208,1.2643,3.7314,4.8893,5.2121,4.9112,1.02,5.2785,0.484,0.5217,5.98,4.3829,5.3285,6.0764,0.5295,3.4053,3.2292,3.2388,1.9316,2.3528,1.9459,0.1988,4.6421,2.0488,3.7458,1.0368,3.1535,4.3979,3.4996,3.4093,0.4858,5.1389,1.2782,2.1416,2.3311,2.1866,2.1991,4.8046,1.5187,2.1385,4.0285,4.1485,1.4524,4.6965,3.1791,5.2419,3.4736,1.9499,0.4739,2.4552,1.836,0.7504,4.2663,2.9878,4.5642,5.373,0.5052,3.1715,1.3236,3.9538,0.032,1.9586,3.1938,1.8403,1.9681,1.7541,2.2987,5.8955,4.7378,1.269,0.5661,4.1754,2.245,2.0595,1.6726,0.0084,1.8173,1.5799,3.432,0.7206,0.0011,5.8222,0.9719,5.9435,0.6494,3.1997,2.935,0.6185,3.7555,3.3339,3.1145,1.3288,2.3924,1.7359,1.2532]}

The Sooners finished fourth in the standings -- in '69, then second in '72 -- and the season went on to win the Orange Bowl. With the win, Virginia Tech took home the conference football title four years later.\n\nThe game is remembered today as a classic college football game that had much less to do with the game and more to do with the coach.

He also played in more than 80 Tests in the same style, helping England win their first Six Nations title after a 4-2 win against South Africa and won the Under-20 World Cup, and again in a 4-2 rout against South Africa, winning three of the final 14 caps.

The average temperature here in January is 28 \u00b0 F (16 \u00b0 C) in the upper tropics and 34 \u00b0 F (27 \u00b0 C) in the lower lower tropics and is also slightly above average for the whole of the winter season. All this could be because of tropical storms originating from the south. Another reason for this could be due to higher humidity of the tropics and lower air flow in winter, due to climate feedback loops that can give rise to dry seasons in the south or higher latitudes. This could mean that the weather of the tropics will be warmer than in summer but for the warm season, the heat would be confined to areas of lower elevation which is more humid. This would also explain the more pleasant cold summers in the south and colder winters in the north.\n\nThis can also be due to the changes in the climate between warmer and colder seasons. It can also be due to natural variability due to changes in temperature, so some of the other factors discussed above could make wind, currents and clouds appear different in this climate.

It was never released in a CD format, nor was a second CD made.\n\nAt the time of the GameCube, the studio received about $100,000 in pledges for the game.","token_len":248,"entropy":[8.3735,3.9616,10.6195,2.7934,4.3473,2.8555,4.1939,0.0471,7.0321,5.5629,4.9458,2.545,0.9938,1.2408,3.2835,2.2756,0.4932,0.8043,11.3852,14.2603,0.0233,1.5253,2.0569,3.3308,0.5352,10.538,2.0062,4.4272,0.0011,0.0005,3.2707,3.2225,5.0669,0.7902,2.7852,3.4746,8.2481,0.4746,5.1771,5.6111,1.8577,1.0269,0.0011,4.453,0.9814,3.8657,2.0301,5.304,1.3693,0.2581,1.9166,3.181,4.5929,5.3347,1.0991,3.1366,3.7143,3.5723,1.2675,6.6721,2.1352,4.908,0.9453,1.4892,5.0205,6.4049,0.2776,2.6261,0.264,0.717,1.3247,3.0857,1.1028,2.5053,1.4616,4.3216,1.3635,3.9836,0.9932,3.7433,4.4465,0.0016,0.8812,3.7803,0.1599,1.941,0.4458,1.8288,4.2884,5.3999,1.7216,3.3743,1.0136,1.8599,5.5551,3.9109,6.2336,2.1456,0.3646,2.574,2.2966,1.7036,2.0143,1.0448,3.4672,1.1399,6.9133,3.1347,1.6832,1.2586,5.3462,4.1596,0.9152,5.2998,3.4371,0.8073,0.7137,2.8522,0.6058,1.8971,1.7846,4.7668,6.3369,1.516,0.4811,6.2893,2.0687,3.9544,0.0712,1.5525,2.3941,2.0653,2.6091,4.1139,0.493,1.4358,4.983,4.6404,0.5565,5.7361,1.27,5.1485,0.9349,0.4916,2.6008,0.0631,3.7716,2.1545,0.8269,0.64,0.0002,1.8252,3.7969,2.2602,5.9691,2.1119,1.3322,5.6449,5.0465,5.1795,1.7587,1.9061,2.2832,2.8924,4.7009,5.5574,3.1309,2.8474,2.4966,1.1951,1.4999,4.4259,0.031,3.801,2.2209,0.6386,0.8985,5.4495,4.2876,1.7733,1.2371,3.9882,0.019,0.4856,2.0026,2.3292,0.0009,2.5597,2.4675,5.3989,2.5338,2.4282,2.1221,5.2949,2.2702,0.6723,2.9643,2.4117,3.2509,1.835,0.0013,3.2423,4.3877,3.1224,2.0484,1.5314,0.6873,3.3027,0.7654,4.5441,0.4566,1.879,3.8708,4.5357,1.0681,1.0678,4.6075,0.9589,3.7519,5.3997,2.1077,2.9738,1.2249,0.9588,0.0002,4.914,0.4664,0.371,0.8596,0.6862,3.3033,0.0207,4.0232,2.3454,4.0302,5.9103,4.1688,0.676,2.7833,0.4506,0.0018,0.7232,4.2924,2.0354,1.0324,0.6825,0.7003]}

He feels that `` people associate the sound of violins with vampires `` due to the `` connection with Eastern Europe and Europe where vampires live in abundance and where they kill people on sight. Lennertz's voice is also heard as he plays the piano and is the only instrument that does not have a piano key as the music is done on the stereo.\nThe finale was arranged by Christopher L. Fischlaub and directed by Steven Aoki. \u00a0The song's composer is William J. Smith, but he is not credited as the composer. The show's composer was Fred Leith who directed most of the production; he also performed on the episode as well as the ending with Fischlaub's piano solo. Leith also had some experience with music, making a cameo in another episode, in the second episode of this episode, When Vampire Is A Dead Man's Life. Also, the opening theme from the episode was part of the story. The following scene has been omitted from the beginning so some of the other elements of the score can be heard. The sequence was also omitted due to having too much space for some instruments.","token_len":249,"entropy":[12.1236,0.9618,11.3244,0.1956,0.0001,3.4628,3.3771,2.04,5.9581,2.0745,3.3011,0.2301,5.5126,7.9183,5.4319,4.0074,1.9056,3.8982,9.0681,0.9515,11.9802,12.2603,8.7177,1.4035,3.6884,0.3421,8.3845,0.2303,0.4182,10.1181,8.3062,6.6973,0.0713,0.8454,5.5796,8.0551,2.9647,9.8027,2.2737,1.3577,4.3449,4.8849,1.6262,2.8236,2.8265,5.7137,1.8337,3.4987,2.0715,4.0871,1.6487,4.4935,1.4176,1.0904,3.4087,0.0009,0.0009,2.8528,4.2267,0.8278,3.6161,4.5952,3.2892,3.2198,3.2669,1.1921,2.5726,2.0899,3.672,3.6348,2.3391,3.9551,1.9219,3.5796,0.0566,1.5261,1.2048,3.2447,4.7403,4.7237,2.1251,4.5972,1.2476,4.7128,3.0011,1.3431,4.9741,0.7108,2.9512,3.5269,5.8946,2.6876,5.1124,0.2995,4.5637,4.08,0.7608,5.6757,4.396,5.6682,1.4403,1.7565,3.4226,0.0166,4.7987,3.8644,5.641,0.3769,6.5317,0.1273,1.0784,4.0799,4.226,4.6767,1.0158,4.8746,3.8162,0.0708,5.0165,1.5397,4.636,1.7376,1.4461,1.3613,1.0591,1.8289,0.8065,0.379,0.7301,2.0179,4.7095,1.5343,3.6057,1.295,5.5196,5.7235,5.1692,4.0334,3.1522,5.7338,0.2437,0.1212,4.4748,5.3476,1.9749,2.0961,4.0069,3.6389,0.7141,2.3241,3.4579,0.9429,1.2422,1.5835,4.7161,6.308,5.839,0.049,0.0319,0.0091,2.4389,3.3906,4.1602,0.2831,4.9731,0.0011,2.1893,3.0792,2.9128,3.1504,1.1729,3.8041,2.6528,5.2503,2.0883,2.8638,0.9257,6.2055,0.2063,2.6087,3.668,2.1896,4.7192,1.6711,1.3274,4.9687,2.8005,1.6933,5.983,5.6853,3.0057,3.9184,4.8623,1.1388,1.5065,2.9889,0.9067,5.5656,0.8987,2.542,3.638,1.5484,3.5516,0.6904,0.648,1.1227,5.459,0.0219,0.657,4.3116,1.6819,2.096,5.6295,5.0684,4.4024,1.336,2.7745,0.7011,0.2756,5.3276,6.3279,6.7903,1.8511,0.2798,4.9651,3.0174,1.7682,0.2513,4.8969,2.116,0.1065,2.1217,0.5895,2.0539,4.8516,2.576,3.6118,3.551,3.2372,0.0058,5.6528,3.5389,1.2097,3.233,1.5994,4.3981,4.4756,0.8361]}

The bill would require the Department of Energy to use $4,000 for each ton of electricity generated from solar on the state and local levels.","token_len":249,"entropy":[5.3423,6.592,1.9436,0.7817,4.7162,1.2314,2.5978,4.4143,10.8211,3.2103,1.44,3.2657,2.5671,2.7764,10.1186,5.0518,0.0015,0.8445,0.129,0.0031,2.6863,4.3709,0.9807,0.1354,1.1727,6.7418,0.0023,5.0758,1.9366,6.8111,0.1022,2.4681,5.624,6.1245,13.8708,7.2517,7.6748,6.7166,10.1361,0.4609,4.1705,0.6275,2.6853,1.3475,3.9071,1.8736,3.7261,2.9585,5.4535,0.8431,4.107,7.1286,2.7915,5.3786,0.577,5.6881,0.782,1.3287,4.4818,2.6481,3.5561,5.7822,0.9349,4.4673,0.7967,1.2607,6.0849,0.6769,1.1285,2.0088,0.0191,1.6508,4.8253,0.9776,0.0022,3.2414,4.5731,5.2767,1.6434,3.1213,0.9123,1.5317,4.17,7.7277,6.4902,0.0462,1.1208,1.1279,2.7826,0.0003,5.6612,4.5201,5.1119,5.4453,5.1079,3.2611,2.0432,2.9285,5.2803,0.1216,4.2596,1.5447,3.6728,5.634,5.3591,3.2075,5.7537,1.7153,0.0139,6.382,2.9191,2.261,0.0021,0.5928,3.1374,5.1778,0.2547,1.0654,5.9093,0.4971,6.702,0.8253,2.8953,6.1766,5.0963,1.6106,1.8892,3.9542,0.2695,1.0971,4.2843,0.6625,0.1635,3.7798,4.7282,3.4955,0.061,2.1096,1.4921,2.3588,0.1281,1.0119,4.7974,3.9318,1.6048,3.0161,1.626,0.9251,0.9194,0.0003,3.5716,5.2441,4.7467,0.2534,5.4312,3.0985,0.2798,4.183,0.169,4.7179,2.0505,6.3688,2.417,3.6672,5.1973,1.4264,3.2417,2.5887,2.449,1.025,3.2434,0.9937,2.5246,5.3089,2.5035,4.0054,2.051,2.4803,4.162,2.054,1.4827,2.7584,0.8938,0.0625,3.4584,5.1578,0.7867,0.5355,0.0003,3.8371,3.5421,0.4062,1.04,5.4052,6.0592,4.6154,1.2759,2.6917,1.7651,0.0027,0.1395,3.4981,6.2985,3.8651,0.5341,0.6099,3.6899,0.0023,0.7909,4.1063,6.4741,1.9783,6.5611,0.0596,1.4061,2.1467,4.5663,3.1432,0.8158,1.4713,0.9029,1.0756,2.7299,2.555,3.1608,0.0009,0.1121,0.2034,4.3548,3.1755,3.5431,4.0171,1.1181,2.6075,0.8198,5.3087,0.2031,2.4251,1.0684,1.479,1.5136,4.9844,1.942,4.5507,1.6878,0.8459,2.3491,0.7807]}

The most reliable redshifts are from spectroscopic data, and the highest confirmed spectroscopic redshift of galaxies are from the MDS (Mex CCD ) telescope. The MDS data contains no objects with known galaxies, but also only light with known high resolution. The redshifts are a result of the change in gas abundances.\nWith this information, we could measure how galaxies and stars change during the early Universe in detail. With high resolution measurements, we could also see if these galaxies were actually getting redshifted or have been changed by mass changes. We could therefore measure the redshift of various stars with high spatial resolution for each MES model. If we did this, we would observe an increase or decrease in the blueshift with a large change in abundance while another object (the cluster star) with high blueshifted abundance was also changing redshifts from time to time.\nIf we could understand, for example, how a dark matter particle behaved during its lifetime, then some of the other galaxies might also have been redshifted. In any case, this is a matter of theoretical uncertainties.","token_len":250,"entropy":[2.6708,1.9685,10.4575,5.2819,1.5255,2.3777,6.5128,7.9262,4.6101,0.4246,1.1552,8.6842,2.5555,2.3324,2.9865,10.989,8.8484,2.9566,1.0611,1.4645,2.0989,3.2799,6.3188,3.2881,0.0982,0.0706,0.6725,3.6969,8.7422,0.9888,0.3539,3.6488,1.7454,2.6005,1.5402,4.4375,6.7399,5.253,1.2413,0.03,1.4071,2.5215,4.2477,2.9362,2.1685,1.0714,2.1309,5.0716,4.3782,3.6242,8.5703,10.4146,2.8431,5.9593,4.2739,1.1785,1.8677,2.1512,0.077,2.6366,5.3908,5.1767,5.521,0.6866,4.2898,5.0628,1.2173,1.2051,4.9084,3.4372,5.9152,2.4324,1.4534,5.9566,4.8171,0.9981,1.6,3.8749,0.774,0.0537,1.2712,5.0642,1.964,0.0042,1.2603,5.8794,0.1259,5.7565,2.8522,0.0011,3.5067,1.9453,11.0985,3.0839,1.8809,0.3564,1.3661,3.0505,4.6583,2.5242,2.9578,2.9137,1.4332,2.7364,4.1751,0.8312,3.1373,1.9541,3.9749,3.2107,0.539,4.5758,5.2449,0.8734,4.6296,0.532,0.5078,0.8895,2.0844,3.1525,3.6439,3.4252,2.3934,3.3319,4.8648,4.8381,2.2804,0.0371,0.6253,3.4174,6.164,1.8314,4.6613,1.8219,5.4746,1.143,0.6225,2.3031,1.4946,4.3357,2.8236,1.0035,2.5791,0.3226,0.532,5.7799,2.6039,3.6048,2.5039,4.6007,0.0323,4.5337,2.6757,6.0405,8.1369,4.6349,0.8355,4.7715,0.9451,3.9109,1.1614,0.3327,0.38,1.1907,4.3694,4.1169,1.1781,4.0786,0.0411,0.2184,0.7088,9.607,0.7183,4.7831,2.9574,4.0871,3.8463,0.1612,5.2944,7.0326,6.1235,4.7672,3.8071,2.4303,5.8924,4.1307,0.7074,3.4052,2.3212,5.0812,2.559,1.8599,0.8154,1.6034,3.1573,2.9486,4.3841,0.1297,0.4652,5.0771,2.1911,0.0454,0.0005,0.179,1.2276,4.7081,0.6368,2.2554,4.8285,5.955,1.1454,0.2047,0.0145,1.1158,3.7663,5.2189,1.1466,2.4839,5.5627,1.6328,2.3544,2.1745,0.5165,2.1194,6.1688,1.0824,0.4664,4.9216,2.6978,2.5599,1.4377,1.2819,1.3521,3.2813,0.0093,0.0071,0.8539,2.9571,4.2453,0.1542,0.025,2.1806,2.3389,1.4256,4.8695,0.0634,4.2618,4.5848,1.095]}

The hypothesis that all three serotonergic proteins protect against encephalitis is supported by data collected by patients and coroners. In some patients with Encephalitis with pilaris, one serotonergic amino acid is present in addition to a serotonergic protein. In a follow-up study published in 1998, one of the primary investigators reported that a large number of patients with menedema with encephalitis show this disease, and that its occurrence is associated with the use of antihistamines. These findings imply that, as there is no correlation between pilariasis and encephalitis, some of the positive immunosuppressive properties found in the immune system may also be due to the use of pilariasis vaccines.","token_len":250,"entropy":[9.5749,6.4831,6.2465,0.1796,5.9285,1.7775,3.5651,0.3003,9.9859,6.1286,2.8091,3.5952,4.9088,0.9686,5.1616,0.1921,9.5608,2.1755,0.8554,7.1997,0.0079,0.0503,2.0291,5.6458,0.5425,6.6639,0.7866,1.9922,0.143,0.4885,1.9767,1.0635,3.5072,4.2548,14.5485,7.6243,4.7613,0.2419,1.25,1.6741,0.5347,4.3711,1.4443,1.3737,0.8766,0.6677,4.9275,4.6748,6.1398,5.3375,1.9176,1.5816,1.7823,0.5596,3.1563,2.6173,6.6307,5.7257,4.7354,0.959,4.1441,4.1475,3.8651,0.0563,0.8128,0.7145,5.3554,0.7596,0.7669,0.0109,1.9813,2.2586,0.5539,1.1253,2.9047,5.7986,2.2567,0.9232,5.0089,1.7558,2.9311,1.143,1.2547,5.4495,1.833,5.3695,3.1445,4.2776,1.3982,2.4347,0.0039,4.1724,2.5513,1.3296,0.3668,0.8207,4.247,0.0093,4.708,0.7619,1.5373,5.3831,1.1474,4.4244,2.0949,0.4938,0.1727,0.0011,0.4001,5.9522,0.475,1.1617,0.0006,0.0282,1.4662,0.8245,0.1001,3.5507,3.9887,1.4845,5.5274,2.7064,4.5339,0.0144,0.9885,2.4306,4.648,3.2167,2.4499,6.1936,4.4702,0.0271,0.0591,5.8606,6.0919,3.4501,2.7313,1.4844,3.9414,1.1999,0.0634,0.0016,6.3158,0.0557,1.5624,2.06,1.3277,5.4753,0.0009,3.0318,1.2417,0.0693,0.0025,1.8699,0.853,1.622,2.8706,5.2234,0.3082,0.0034,0.7879,5.0842,0.1123,2.565,0.3783,4.1531,1.3519,0.5238,5.2647,1.7979,2.2326,0.4786,2.8541,5.0824,0.876,0.0027,1.0864,0.4978,7.8805,6.8423,2.8375,1.5753,2.3543,0.0024,0.009,5.3556,5.2989,5.032,2.6302,1.9006,1.0303,5.128,4.215,1.018,2.8092,0.0098,2.3413,1.6342,0.0176,4.0672,2.0123,0.1324,0.8061,3.9315,1.9549,5.726,0.171,4.0335,3.0314,5.5401,0.5759,0.9561,4.8449,0.1096,5.1079,0.0297,8.3509,0.2899,1.4999,0.0011,0.0145,0.2549,4.9283,2.2405,0.3815,5.6863,5.1155,1.8776,0.0111,0.7592,1.7342,4.5969,0.2536,1.8042,6.1475,0.9408,1.476,2.841,0.517,1.4079,0.0158,0.9479,2.1671,0.0015,3.1538,0.0029,0.7566,5.0989,0.2685]}

{"id":1744,"ended":true,"length":247,"gen_text":"Two music videos, both directed by David LaChapelle, were shot for the song and its accompanying remix. The videos introduced a less demure image of Carey, one that received negative backlash, and some were even criticized for the track's resemblance to David Bowie's \"All I Have is You\". Many have suggested that the track was created to celebrate the 60's and 70's as part of the trend. In 2004, two days after the original song had been produced, the soundtrack to the film was released using the same song name and original producer's logo. According to the producers, they tried to make new music, but were stopped by studio representatives from their own song selection. In the following years, one would find out for certain that music produced by VCRs was the same as music mastered for use on CDs.

In 1911 he attended the First Universal Races Congress in London and he published his first novel, The Quest of the Silver Fleece.\n\nDu Bois' career began in 1889 and continued into the 1920s, when he completed his studies in the British Library. On 26 September 1920 Du Bois founded the Du Bois Library at Cambridge University. The library is part of Cambridge University and was inaugurated on 6 December 1929 and is located in the main building in the west-west corner of the library.\n\nThe Du Bois Library is the world's first private collection of scientific papers with the largest corpus of abstracts and the largest volume of abstracts on topics for which major research is done, with an impressive number of published papers published for over 400 years.\n\nThe Du Bois Library can be a great place for research into scientific topics with the possible exception of its recent discovery that the 'Black Hole' and the 'Emissary Nebula' can never have existed.\n\nOur thanks to Du Bois for his many contributions to world science.

This station was named for Baron Bertrand Brandt, the famous author of the book Ghent: The Secret History of the Great German Industry. The station was named for Brandt who founded the small Swedish shop the Bergen Mercantile Co. In later years the station was named after the German architect Ludwig Riesen, which was the center of the city center after Friedrich Wiebeck's death, and later the Ghent-style hotel, where there is a contemporary style and the building's modern style, so some of the original construction work was done there.

According to the producers, they actually wanted to do this because the main characters would be too emotionally attached to them, thus making the main characters less memorable. I would argue that this is a mistake, with Greed's budget being too tight for one or two characters. The main plot, on the other hand, has multiple people, which makes it easier for them to be around.

He asserted that the relaxation could be deepened in most cases by `` palming ``, or covering the eyes with cloth. His idea is that people could be helped to relax completely by eating foods containing water or with herbs such as garlic, sage and sweet peppers.\nAn interesting finding was that men tended to abstain from using drugs such as heroin after eating. According to Dr. Robert R. W. MacDougall, professor emeritus and lead author of Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, most patients consumed the lowest amount of drugs after being stopped by alcohol. In other words, more than half of alcoholics stopped using because they were consuming it because they wanted to, with less alcohol. This suggests that an abstainer or a more restrained lifestyle could provide the more pleasant result while also allowing for abstinence. Dr. McCune was also an easy target for people who had no interest in drinking and did not seek medical attention. Dr. MacDougall was not discouraged by the results of his study.

{"id":893,"ended":true,"length":235,"gen_text":"The development and use of the term Wicca within contemporary Paganism has been a recurring topic of discussion in the field of Pagan studies. The majority of academics and independent scholars use the first example where Wicca are identified as part of the natural world. The phrase Wicca is widely used in academic circles as a noun and is the primary means of addressing the nature of the source of the word. The development thus has been an interesting and often contentious issue.\n\nThe question thus arises whether or not Wicca are included in Pagan literature where it is not used. The most interesting and significant question is this: have Wicca been considered as part of Pagan lore? To this question, I will take on various aspects of Pagan history as well as with reference to the use of Wicca or the nature of the origin of the word. One can then be drawn away from the issue by some considerations.\n\nOne can also give examples to the extent to which the history of Pagan origins and use of Wicca in contemporary Pagan studies has taken on a different perspective. A number of key terms are proposed in support of this view. I will also include examples of other terms that might be helpful to those who are aware of the term.","token_len":254,"entropy":[7.9892,4.0478,3.3505,0.0326,2.489,5.8509,8.9025,5.1878,0.5333,7.5904,6.6963,5.1781,1.1059,2.1165,1.0321,3.0857,5.7126,2.5333,1.1584,0.7924,1.5729,1.1118,4.7134,0.4942,1.7363,3.8691,0.8036,2.1053,6.2683,0.0419,7.412,2.0196,8.8733,0.8985,5.5139,0.2888,8.8267,4.7466,5.7571,2.0204,0.1072,0.1292,5.0678,4.5388,0.769,3.5374,0.0239,0.997,5.0019,1.7368,1.5011,1.9996,5.7366,2.2901,0.0417,0.0517,1.4474,5.4968,0.4675,1.2107,4.9285,0.4677,2.3313,0.6847,4.7478,1.9508,2.408,4.407,3.5663,3.9102,0.6308,5.1933,1.0444,4.4743,0.2363,0.9426,5.8632,0.6595,1.135,2.1909,0.5452,1.9079,5.3986,9.2982,1.8214,0.9948,3.6085,3.3651,2.0774,3.3689,2.8429,2.1998,0.9719,1.4843,0.0085,1.6178,4.5331,6.3142,0.6007,2.4363,2.7261,0.0034,1.4502,0.0245,0.0384,1.6492,5.6779,1.3313,1.8413,3.4752,6.3072,1.6365,0.3872,2.0452,4.0482,2.189,1.6417,3.9042,4.8562,1.534,4.1767,1.9779,0.9593,3.0365,0.2754,5.8291,1.0734,0.0211,0.0496,0.6462,3.5233,2.0472,0.4854,0.0032,1.1239,3.7593,1.3119,4.6681,2.3258,1.0303,1.2889,3.1597,1.9173,4.0119,5.3774,5.4521,2.2262,0.5013,3.6158,3.1304,3.7549,1.2442,0.0349,5.0626,3.2263,0.0233,1.1373,4.3572,0.0811,0.6194,0.013,0.0393,5.0078,1.9406,4.061,0.0711,0.7958,4.1877,0.3361,0.9457,0.4442,0.5619,5.6671,3.7771,3.4141,5.365,3.3467,5.0532,0.0407,0.647,3.4744,1.9432,5.142,4.4711,2.0686,0.7044,0.0002,3.9613,2.3121,2.5007,5.9532,4.7468,3.2787,3.0209,2.3437,1.2862,0.0018,1.858,5.1875,0.1349,2.357,5.7863,1.9241,2.3011,0.2848,0.2685,0.0044,0.0152,2.9735,3.6619,0.2327,2.0361,1.7485,4.8546,1.3033,1.2478,2.1032,4.8815,0.7958,3.7302,1.8724,0.0042,5.7262,5.6455,1.9739,5.2548,2.5094,4.4018,0.0429,0.7761,1.5221,0.6188,3.6898,0.6472,4.0885,4.0304,2.1561,0.6458,3.7231,1.3047,1.5032,3.2321,0.7061,3.0841,1.2456,1.7037,1.1452,1.7515,5.0361,0.0876,0.911,5.5058,1.1277]}

He is known to sing in various voices while sitting at opposite ends of a desk with his hands in his lap, although those voices seem to vary to accommodate him. All he may sing in is a monotone.\n\nHe was once called 'Father of Fingers' by the Royal Pint in an act that he performed for the King of Scots and then lost his trademark 'Fingers' to his vocal cords. The play continued with him singing with his fingers and the king could have said something or made a hand gesture to signify that he would be there. This was later confirmed to be a false word.\n\nPossibly more than any other musician has his vocal cords cut off or he was forced to wear bandage to use them.\n\nSinger is generally described as a very good, well rounded person.

The reason? Because there were fewer characters in black at the top with less text. This will increase the need to edit the text.\nAs a result more words can be created with less colour, which makes some characters more hard to see, but it also keeps your readers away from the text.\nI'm not sure that there's much I can say beyond confirming my previous assumption, so I'm afraid I won't address it here.

As part of the development of the new transport links between west London and south-east Bury, construction of a new station in Giggley Park was also conducted and the A511 train was then installed.","token_len":260,"entropy":[10.9567,9.858,8.0342,10.5034,6.7644,7.9105,6.9795,7.8143,9.802,8.3852,6.9984,6.8887,10.9562,13.3398,5.4133,13.0281,1.2115,8.3442,8.4987,9.1338,4.0764,3.487,13.7255,6.6148,5.6659,8.6637,5.2992,7.4444,7.5632,2.9217,5.1932,4.7109,9.3046,0.1756,2.0303,0.0686,0.0375,0.0261,3.4027,6.6319,4.6974,13.8338,10.7335,5.2997,4.6358,5.8437,6.2331,1.2044,0.0509,1.3244,6.2315,3.4883,12.7899,1.8805,1.087,0.991,4.2522,0.7373,0.408,1.8275,1.3605,0.4974,4.8489,3.0179,4.7622,2.4253,0.3464,5.3957,5.0591,2.0879,2.9157,5.3653,1.593,0.9464,0.1054,5.4556,1.0837,0.0555,1.1638,4.3082,2.5448,0.1518,1.4338,1.985,0.0087,1.5861,2.9938,11.5527,5.789,1.5723,2.8778,0.0291,0.6756,1.5403,2.1142,4.9809,1.7467,5.273,0.928,0.1507,2.9173,0.0201,6.232,0.5989,2.5861,0.8783,1.3181,6.2099,0.0181,3.9573,3.1428,0.0046,1.0875,3.1605,3.8477,1.7,1.2498,1.2357,1.2255,1.5349,2.2944,2.0138,5.2152,3.4498,1.6103,2.4684,1.5107,0.5407,0.0028,1.899,1.1679,5.8125,4.2907,1.6724,5.5343,0.0179,4.4705,2.2981,4.447,0.9384,0.2578,2.9542,2.0569,3.1465,4.5305,2.3043,0.6785,4.7736,2.3677,6.024,5.5701,2.1603,2.0754,3.9328,3.061,3.6496,0.5355,1.5804,5.1446,4.5684,5.8721,0.0386,0.379,4.3616,6.0789,4.754,0.4545,3.6228,5.4574,6.2582,4.5892,5.0116,4.5912,1.7247,6.5778,3.137,0.0936,0.396,2.4928,0.0578,0.3911,1.2118,0.3205,3.0288,2.4652,1.1484,0.7841,5.5927,0.1194,4.7005,5.3962,5.6261,2.5522,1.421,5.3639,2.3972,4.0337,3.2294,0.1846,4.5249,5.4469,2.7234,1.714,1.272,5.1082,6.6926,4.8486,5.3313,1.7976,0.9553,2.1024,4.1593,4.3001,0.4109,5.257,5.3643,3.0234,5.2778,1.5151,0.0008,0.6085,4.8143,0.9334,0.4451,3.2999,5.7623,1.5717,2.1054,3.8637,0.3511,0.0575,3.3857,3.3857,0.1529,6.1962,0.2164,0.3646,5.3609,1.1871,2.4282,1.1804,3.2828,2.2401,5.1745,5.1457,4.6219,2.5784,1.7214,1.9143,5.3567,3.5026,1.6731,3.0655,0.2708,5.1821,1.8645,4.9021,3.7199,0.9235]}

The show has been popular because of its dramatic finale and the fact that there was no one to blame. The story was told by a love of music but there is nothing that is wrong with it. This is a very great and emotional episode of the movie. The music is a very good rendition of the song \"We're on the Right Side of the Road\" by The White Stripes. This show will leave no impression on you and the audience. While we would suggest playing for at least a minute before you see this movie the fact that we are on the right side of the road with a large group shows up in your head.

This database includes the Galileo orbiter, as well as other orbital data from the Large Hadron Collider, the Hubble Space Telescope, and from the KESOV program.","token_len":261,"entropy":[5.3423,10.0313,1.0238,3.4802,3.3562,1.6473,1.6455,3.389,6.359,0.0023,1.0987,0.7673,4.1357,1.5805,0.7573,1.0558,0.5061,2.0257,2.873,3.3242,0.1326,3.803,0.2744,2.0771,4.0383,0.0012,1.1883,0.674,2.0564,4.1975,3.5643,1.4207,1.2875,4.4879,7.9649,0.9653,1.7072,0.5709,0.5596,2.0826,1.7059,3.9742,1.0849,0.1508,0.6796,4.8145,0.6178,4.805,5.0105,3.1323,4.3202,2.1391,1.3344,1.9518,5.6745,0.8346,1.7492,3.8188,0.0827,4.9588,2.773,5.6302,0.9172,4.488,6.1629,0.0166,3.2947,0.0598,2.3868,0.0472,2.4207,2.1586,2.4441,0.7302,4.0075,1.6703,4.1602,2.7117,1.6551,5.6537,0.1883,6.2026,3.69,2.6652,2.7075,0.9257,1.0472,0.3299,3.6515,4.1555,1.2128,0.9808,2.0031,0.0003,1.8215,3.9059,3.6007,1.3566,2.6855,1.7509,3.3947,4.743,1.9192,4.7791,5.5976,2.5516,0.4274,3.7069,0.5575,5.3022,1.3865,5.5394,0.9868,5.932,0.3675,3.6121,0.0118,0.0041,2.5084,1.0081,4.9773,0.0105,2.4901,1.754,0.5172,0.3282,5.5723,0.0011,0.7035,1.9677,3.7325,3.2733,1.9617,1.2084,2.0372,0.3359,0.6497,0.3293,1.3028,1.9465,3.123,3.7289,0.4791,3.4259,3.5689,4.5372,4.6558,1.3523,3.5811,0.985,4.1583,4.2234,1.39,4.2098,4.8229,3.9806,0.6513,0.9286,0.0003,5.0601,3.0165,4.2453,1.3574,0.0002,4.0619,0.6305,0.6305,0.5086,0.0002,1.6002,5.2491,6.8455,1.0752,2.3928,0.3977,0.0002,3.1004,4.2388,0.0344,0.001,3.3101,1.2934,0.4706,4.8908,2.1885,0.5429,5.9469,3.9594,0.7173,0.1463,1.2648,0.595,0.771,0.403,1.4543,2.7858,1.0049,1.4604,0.6219,4.6059,2.6408,5.0743,4.2666,2.0886,1.8136,0.0197,0.0019,6.0658,0.3087,6.1656,3.5935,1.6514,4.826,0.2156,3.3655,0.002,4.018,0.9644,2.6273,0.2729,6.4265,0.2059,0.3692,3.8461,0.9706,0.5528,4.2832,5.4198,2.2021,3.4298,4.3492,1.6597,0.0314,1.1952,2.98,0.0049,0.0042,2.2449,5.2115,1.5318,1.5042,0.932,5.7391,0.4487,0.0,0.0006,1.1173,0.7862,4.0359,0.1,0.0012,0.2006,0.7678,6.6314,0.7478,4.7149,7.6745,1.9333,6.1547,0.558]}

At the birth in the year 2000 of the first child, he was raised in Woodbury Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey, and has lived for the past 20 years in the county as a child until April 16, 2012.\n\nHe was taken to New Jersey after his birth. He received a doctor report in January 2006 on what he had seen on Facebook. However, it is unknown how his mother was able to have him circumcised. This led the State Hospital in New Jersey to issue a referral for a surgical circumcision on May 11, 2010.\n\nHe was subsequently circumcised on May 16, 2012, at a later date.

Emily continued moving nearly parallel to the coast before finally descending over the Bering Sea. The hurricane was named P.G.J., because of its unusual pattern of shifting course. Its main body was moving south- to northwest-northwestward as P.G.J. continued to move northeastward. This storm was labeled after the famous hurricane of the early 1900s which struck the Philippines and hit southeastward. It was named after King Juan Carlos III and the island's first elected governor. The hurricane continued moving northeastward with more powerful force this time, but with less or no impact. P.G.J. moved westward, turning into an easterly direction later on. As a result more than 80 feet of rain fell in the area from the center of the hurricane center, which included parts of the Bay of Biscay, the Bering Sea, and the southeastern tip of the Amazon basin.\n\nThe storm made some of the closest landfall of the year on Sunday, June 7 when it passed right over the Spanish port of Antigua.

An important feature of bamboo is the appearance of dark patches of reddish-green and orange flowers covered by a thick, translucent body that grows along the body of bonsai. The yellow pigment is the main pigment used to manufacture bamboo. The bamboo with the largest diameter of the body of a bonsai is called bamboo lianas, since it is highly durable with one species having a diameter of up to 400 mm ( 6.5 in ). Once inside a bamboo mason's mason's box or with the help of a mason guide, bamboo lianas can hold about 80 mason's weight, and there are many varieties of bamboo plants available to grow on top of some of the tallest trees. Unlike other plants found in the wild in China, bamboo lianas will tolerate many insect impacts and are very easily cut down. These impacts are quite severe but are very peaceful.","token_len":264,"entropy":[8.7482,10.4021,1.5641,8.9623,5.0439,6.4185,0.0221,3.7919,2.1385,1.9329,11.3246,0.9841,1.3385,3.8598,10.9245,0.8798,5.9909,4.8973,0.0992,6.4695,8.3953,2.7141,1.6015,7.9032,1.6443,3.4972,0.6597,0.811,3.7797,0.0027,9.4571,1.0228,5.3888,1.0891,2.2419,7.8513,6.4265,3.3471,8.2112,2.3545,4.5983,2.0935,6.1168,5.2561,1.8057,0.0118,0.6282,1.8686,3.7683,0.8743,4.7959,4.8033,5.075,3.8609,1.7282,0.1889,0.5461,2.4781,1.5043,0.1968,0.5083,1.5252,5.314,0.0784,0.0183,4.964,2.9622,7.1674,3.265,3.2308,2.7772,1.5362,2.9506,3.7761,3.2305,2.6045,1.6531,5.2979,0.1289,0.3878,4.3026,0.7835,5.9567,3.1264,1.3095,0.1632,5.8397,1.5858,1.4581,5.5381,0.0862,5.4689,4.0162,0.9795,5.2701,0.0051,0.987,2.9689,4.5046,3.2187,3.3626,6.4115,1.6615,1.9169,3.03,1.3784,4.3321,5.3634,2.3666,3.968,4.0982,0.3591,3.6331,1.8141,5.2021,0.0195,0.0035,0.7431,1.7879,4.8765,5.4656,2.8369,3.311,2.6208,1.4531,1.3974,1.5809,5.1336,1.8116,1.5324,1.8425,2.5838,5.899,1.1174,3.2359,3.4799,1.4612,1.1864,2.5938,2.8941,1.3173,0.3631,0.0777,0.0017,0.781,1.0384,2.7969,5.0379,1.3285,1.3316,1.4899,5.9687,0.8496,1.0379,5.7785,4.3233,4.3877,5.2008,5.6558,1.9967,1.3138,2.5647,0.2495,2.9572,0.0022,5.1109,1.1956,0.2289,4.8474,2.4527,1.4338,0.2498,0.6341,6.0376,5.719,1.761,0.7514,5.7284,2.122,1.1887,2.3802,0.1483,0.8281,1.078,3.3319,5.0859,2.3602,2.9214,0.0096,0.7055,3.4962,0.3655,6.3623,0.4556,1.3455,1.2478,0.0268,0.008,1.9413,5.4743,3.4228,4.4218,4.4581,0.9817,0.7366,2.674,2.2774,1.6379,4.9736,0.5269,2.1278,1.9495,0.5036,0.267,6.3595,2.4409,2.509,2.8052,2.4912,5.4301,0.1173,6.9585,0.8436,0.5947,5.2037,1.1782,1.4687,6.0312,1.6611,3.0062,4.2361,0.5401,1.4336,2.2416,3.6811,2.6334,0.2094,0.2222,0.681,0.0212,0.0053,4.86,4.786,4.1777,5.4278,6.5015,1.8113,2.8874,2.9853,5.2049,4.7039,0.9043,1.4614,4.4477,4.6153,1.404,4.2789,1.8221,3.8541,2.1086,3.1506,5.8655,1.0662]}

{"id":2200,"ended":true,"length":249,"gen_text":"Opposition to Chicago's skyscrapers began to grow during the late 1880s and early 1890s. Even before the development of the skyscraper, some criticized large buildings in Chicago for dominating churches and private homes. At one point in the 1900s, the Rev. William Brown wrote to his pastor in response to public disapproval for a church in the city.\n\nAn article in the New York Times reported that the building's development took place years after the development was scheduled to begin. During the early decade of the early 1900s, Chicago's most high-profile buildings were listed for demolition. The most notable such buildings in Chicago's history were West Side Plaza and Old Town Place. The city's most prominent buildings, including one recently on fire for destroying a chapel, were demolished with a simple twist.\n\nIn 1890, President Theodore Roosevelt ordered the demolition of the former Methodist Church in East Harlem, marking the second demolition of any Episcopal Church in America after the demolition of the Rev. James Wood and the removal of the building on Fifth Avenue to mark the end of the Civil War.\n\nIn 1900, the demolition of three of Chicago's largest historic buildings was announced in Chicago's city hall.

{"id":2528,"ended":true,"length":249,"gen_text":"The gray wolf's expressive behavior is more complex than that of the coyote and golden jackal, as necessitated by its group living and hunting habits. While less gregarious canids generally possess simple, vocal and subliminally organized behaviors similar to the gray wolf, we find little evidence for generalized variation with this form of wolf behavior, although we do seem to see that in several individuals, a gray wolf could have evolved from an early lineage where these behaviors were more closely similar to other wolf and coyotes. In addition, in wolf behavior experiments and studies of captive wild wolves, we show that grey wolves are generally socialized to provide specific social support, and with few examples of these responses available to the group, we speculate that wolves were more adapted for social socialization, with less complex social patterns of behavior, which is more distinct from cemeteries, and more likely to be the group with the most social members. Although we do not have a clear sense of the relationship between gray wolf socialization and survival, it is unlikely to have affected the proportion of the group's mates that remain present in their community for generations. Our sample included more gray wolves than any other wolf in this study, so further explorations on mating behaviors, and the interplay of socialization, socialization-in-kind, and individual variation are warranted.","token_len":272,"entropy":[10.097,4.7547,3.0058,10.6547,5.3804,1.5712,4.7251,4.4994,0.6903,1.5424,0.1433,1.4812,4.5783,0.2005,2.7982,8.3498,6.3948,0.4997,1.0903,3.7269,14.349,0.1458,0.0538,2.0479,8.6451,7.4911,5.079,2.2924,6.9313,0.4355,4.9253,8.2294,7.1911,0.9993,0.0,8.4148,6.2832,5.1163,4.5022,8.2802,1.8511,5.6611,3.1824,5.1698,2.8123,2.9661,4.2926,2.2834,5.4956,0.035,1.8045,2.0711,0.081,0.4737,5.6657,2.2458,4.3174,0.4596,1.7889,6.1193,5.315,5.3731,3.4528,4.8656,0.1891,3.5635,0.7958,2.7974,3.707,3.2429,1.2829,6.7146,0.0276,2.6614,3.7737,4.9064,5.3899,4.115,1.4799,3.3136,2.9328,0.0132,5.7195,2.7052,2.0387,3.0583,2.3287,4.2783,5.1693,4.8586,5.4717,1.2315,0.7309,2.9106,3.2266,5.6723,0.9639,3.6385,2.0785,5.4692,0.8712,0.5081,0.4753,2.8631,2.058,0.204,3.5355,4.9072,5.2341,4.782,4.4904,3.7606,0.8146,5.0854,4.0424,1.391,0.4602,0.7747,3.3313,0.1911,4.4664,0.2242,2.2766,4.0266,4.5079,2.3588,1.2353,5.6921,5.9576,1.6734,1.9081,2.1544,1.9827,5.5418,4.0729,4.3155,0.3494,4.7558,5.7298,5.2696,2.132,2.3815,4.001,0.7862,0.9912,3.6976,0.0688,4.0601,3.4256,2.468,4.5259,2.5816,1.1126,4.3927,0.9708,3.3305,3.5826,3.8519,5.2462,1.6971,5.7382,3.9083,1.586,2.3989,3.3459,2.826,3.3276,5.2591,0.1842,6.4242,6.5726,0.0239,0.0008,2.4921,2.3065,2.7728,1.451,0.2524,1.1868,4.3513,4.2734,4.0389,0.7936,0.7694,1.8618,4.7457,0.3522,4.2823,1.7015,1.7219,0.1362,2.0479,1.8724,1.6157,4.5958,0.0944,1.2973,3.5049,0.066,1.5064,0.6901,2.2517,0.2893,0.095,4.6024,1.2495,2.0725,0.6412,5.0485,3.2717,2.0534,3.9508,1.0389,5.6904,0.0453,2.7369,1.7801,2.3681,5.3006,1.1507,4.6511,6.1722,1.4236,2.3999,5.2769,2.9074,3.0042,0.8807,3.5073,6.4755,3.2506,4.5052,2.9146,0.1013,0.2699,1.844,0.228,2.1418,2.0364,3.358,0.4854,0.8657,3.9176,3.8244,4.5499,0.4076,5.1237,6.3404,2.8342,2.3701,2.5567,1.7238,5.4316,1.2039,1.0226,2.5212,1.5002,1.4207,1.4213,1.3875,1.7696,4.5735,0.3755,3.825,0.7126,0.2723,3.8419,2.4999,2.5594,1.6457,0.1076]}

The ball found the Miami defense and got caught off balance by Mike Ditka of Wisconsin, however Miami attempted the field goal to score, so it hit the outside post.\n\nFinally, Miami's second field goal of the game on a 9-yard gain on a touchdown, gave the Panthers momentum heading into overtime.\n\nThe most noteworthy moment of the game was the turnover against the San Francisco 49ers 5-yard line on the opening drive.","token_len":280,"entropy":[2.3183,9.1625,1.8535,7.9043,4.1479,3.4686,5.0171,7.0413,1.2569,6.6042,5.9435,2.5337,3.7926,3.7258,1.0054,0.2283,1.4578,3.5534,4.3633,6.0195,15.3179,9.0657,7.2366,9.2675,0.6808,0.6146,1.7774,3.8099,3.0206,1.7665,2.8798,1.2294,3.1047,4.1156,4.061,6.6233,4.0381,0.4713,0.6764,4.7118,0.4871,3.3371,0.0183,2.077,3.2414,1.1011,4.5666,1.4184,0.6707,2.1783,0.0023,1.6519,2.21,1.2382,4.8591,1.0549,3.6258,3.2912,0.3957,0.8054,3.4068,2.5134,0.227,1.6306,0.1253,1.4103,4.8065,5.3097,4.3649,3.6719,5.8021,2.554,0.803,3.7214,5.6202,0.9342,5.642,0.2578,0.0111,0.0031,5.8875,0.0687,0.0028,2.6522,1.7246,1.0708,0.7331,1.2881,1.448,0.0004,1.9906,4.382,2.5393,1.958,1.2813,2.2423,0.0057,6.344,5.7814,0.3185,1.8935,3.9767,2.852,0.0116,3.3264,3.553,2.8033,5.1683,0.7079,3.0358,3.0773,2.6883,1.9562,0.9117,4.0427,3.5226,5.6281,4.0897,0.2889,1.1971,0.0678,2.7627,1.8228,0.0061,5.6778,0.9597,2.4319,3.2959,0.6023,0.0154,4.0214,3.6975,3.1203,0.0727,3.9932,0.4277,0.6425,5.6387,0.3039,0.4642,0.0004,4.369,3.4647,0.6227,0.928,0.05,0.923,1.643,0.006,1.1832,2.414,4.7584,0.0479,5.6469,3.665,1.1712,4.686,0.8916,4.0862,0.5689,0.6002,0.0004,1.7668,4.4521,1.2783,2.2246,1.5261,3.6853,0.0097,1.0102,4.1185,6.3673,4.0089,1.5438,1.6454,2.4478,0.3618,1.4487,4.3161,0.6916,3.8828,5.7769,0.2944,1.4749,0.7046,1.5829,0.47,1.8284,3.0687,5.8973,1.4289,1.6981,1.1652,2.2676,5.1618,3.7643,4.2096,2.7487,1.2796,5.4389,5.211,0.5968,0.0142,3.2362,3.3082,1.6343,7.5294,2.8282,5.0718,3.509,1.7801,0.0608,2.8175,4.5837,3.1682,5.9387,1.6696,4.4934,0.6735,5.5075,4.6649,1.3964,0.4181,0.0003,5.8719,0.2686,2.0651,2.5609,2.6053,0.5082,0.0047,2.0108,0.0123,0.2558,4.937,1.1047,4.39,0.0781,0.0039,3.4381,2.5339,1.0319,4.5917,3.3544,3.9971,0.8737,4.7319,6.5988,1.9644,0.0449,0.793,0.4029,0.6131,0.0003,1.6096,6.1154,4.5947,2.8825,0.82,0.1933,0.4824,1.4445,1.2173,4.9427,5.1781,1.9673,5.2894,0.9487,0.0497,0.0042,6.6942,0.5832,0.2258,0.6096,2.6707,1.4276,2.564,0.7973,1.3541]}

But I guess the evidence might not be there to support this speculation which is so contradictory to the truth.","token_len":281,"entropy":[7.5329,3.1005,12.7086,2.1592,9.6672,2.976,4.7693,6.5111,1.4998,7.4296,2.3223,1.4903,6.8375,1.0157,10.3291,6.1908,0.8684,3.7023,6.0249,2.5905,1.5318,11.2655,13.0118,8.6586,4.4407,6.7448,3.2183,7.3355,5.8253,0.6245,2.9046,0.0203,0.659,10.6883,1.775,1.5337,2.0354,2.3175,1.7494,1.8063,3.9156,0.0223,0.8299,0.5324,0.7445,1.9133,7.4678,5.736,1.8353,2.5576,2.4419,5.1031,4.6442,5.9426,5.0019,1.6148,0.6468,3.5868,0.7878,7.0305,4.987,4.0548,4.081,3.8721,1.4282,1.8602,1.406,4.8344,5.0298,5.2776,2.4578,5.5084,2.433,3.7275,5.3222,2.4111,1.794,5.1658,1.2624,4.2922,3.5366,1.3645,3.7899,5.2086,5.0145,0.2385,4.3453,5.5087,2.4966,4.6657,1.5726,5.3494,2.3125,0.4417,2.2009,5.8481,3.5894,2.3357,3.1039,0.1886,0.3385,1.0743,1.9789,2.0214,3.2014,2.4883,5.0757,1.0193,4.1443,1.0628,3.7595,2.8131,1.4392,0.8135,3.7612,4.5531,5.4083,2.072,4.5555,1.802,1.8245,2.1772,4.3713,2.0763,2.3603,1.1053,3.6069,4.1193,5.5402,5.25,5.7998,2.9232,0.0886,4.9774,0.5006,3.1989,1.4135,0.4024,2.6231,0.4725,1.1561,0.7803,0.3057,0.8829,0.4435,3.8525,5.8841,1.5803,1.3429,1.1305,0.2335,4.699,2.7989,1.979,2.3452,5.1145,4.1142,3.4251,1.2943,3.6418,1.462,3.827,4.3083,0.925,2.5706,4.2184,4.4058,4.4221,2.2942,5.4168,4.9969,2.4047,1.6521,1.8232,2.063,2.2385,2.1835,6.0023,2.2439,3.9948,1.1848,5.7734,4.1712,0.0062,0.0483,0.4072,0.1488,1.9952,4.6443,2.7362,5.2788,0.3506,3.2522,3.1906,0.0046,4.5781,5.8179,3.5384,5.1547,0.6831,3.0639,2.8182,1.0581,0.1035,0.2797,2.9732,6.1854,5.4358,1.4943,5.0613,0.7798,2.319,1.0253,2.4688,5.6199,0.4023,3.3057,3.072,5.2269,2.3064,1.7319,4.1354,2.9733,4.9709,1.2943,0.4359,4.3797,0.1907,1.3103,0.582,0.1347,0.6666,1.6681,0.7402,1.4787,0.1134,0.1089,0.194,4.9008,1.5558,3.6,0.0104,2.3598,0.8904,3.3741,3.6878,4.5206,2.4786,4.5189,3.3617,1.9911,1.2378,0.0294,0.3292,0.2429,1.6016,3.6016,2.3303,0.4734,3.4776,1.8267,4.048,2.7706,5.3075,5.7828,2.3794,0.572,1.4759,3.3014,0.589,1.5937,5.6766,6.0264,1.466,4.5834,5.8667,1.69,1.3112,5.2297,0.7047]}

{"id":2727,"ended":false,"length":278,"gen_text":"Regardless of her dedication to the preservation of the Everglades, Douglas admitted the time she spent actually there was sporadic, driving there for occasional picnics. `` To be a friend of the Everglades is to live for long nights,'' she wrote. During the winter, she spent time in Oregon, Washington and Oregon State, and she has maintained a car that's powered by a 12 gauge gas tank but is also used for running water. ''I'd probably have to drive around and go through the whole desert three times,'' she said. ''When I'm at work and then it's raining and the car pulls up, you have to go through the whole desert all the way up to the sky and I'm stuck on the top end.'' Although Douglas' work with the Everglades has been an important one, it has also been difficult to see more than a small portion of Oregon and Hawaii. One of the first things that made its way south, during the great summer storms and the long cold winters, was the rugged terrain that existed at those sites, which are part of the Great Barrier Reef nation's vast national coral reef. It turns out there is a lot of variety on the reef. As for some of the other places that are known for their beauty, there are just as many of them as there are of the Everglades ; Douglas says, ``I've never been to Hawaii.''","token_len":284,"entropy":[2.0565,5.7278,8.2142,0.8198,1.6327,6.568,0.1059,1.2564,8.1307,1.0707,0.005,0.5962,8.4421,6.8081,3.7809,6.2048,2.6728,0.379,9.0655,6.3044,0.8992,10.3926,2.1348,8.3781,6.4014,3.3029,7.0142,8.3375,0.0065,0.0081,1.0181,11.8034,12.6643,1.841,4.0457,6.3965,1.0972,1.2802,0.6967,0.0009,0.0073,1.506,2.0274,3.5617,4.0439,4.168,6.4261,1.8209,0.2394,3.3996,0.5676,6.6661,1.3471,2.9368,0.7024,0.8806,3.1021,3.1608,1.6419,6.2549,1.4895,3.6996,1.1083,2.9278,1.8318,1.4937,2.3158,2.8308,4.8214,5.0427,1.0837,5.212,2.9606,3.3279,5.5442,0.3564,1.4522,4.7269,5.2386,3.3335,1.2268,5.9674,2.7032,3.4371,4.1715,1.2511,4.9852,2.5674,0.9725,3.9907,1.8938,4.3219,4.8233,2.7317,1.4488,2.3365,2.9073,3.569,3.4937,2.8215,1.3974,2.8933,5.6639,5.9347,0.5304,1.9701,0.2334,0.7415,0.1637,2.4131,4.4791,0.6664,2.1782,3.8406,2.5366,2.9939,5.6757,3.6961,0.3641,2.7278,2.0747,2.485,3.0106,5.1508,1.0937,1.1427,3.3946,3.1819,0.3565,2.4535,1.2612,0.9334,1.4432,0.7597,4.6267,0.3015,1.5255,2.7704,1.0382,0.8765,5.0617,2.3354,4.1213,1.7471,3.7004,2.9094,0.6558,3.5473,4.4027,1.5602,5.1332,1.3896,3.0542,4.3602,3.0133,0.4503,0.1579,0.0003,0.0065,1.6358,1.0859,4.5482,2.633,3.1474,0.5185,2.4413,1.7736,1.6534,1.4827,2.9289,0.8237,4.2962,5.7214,0.6166,0.9238,2.864,1.6564,0.0857,6.3161,2.6126,6.7316,0.7116,4.7781,0.8821,0.8088,3.3754,1.6691,1.8961,3.6169,5.9443,0.0523,4.2548,3.4407,5.8829,0.5431,5.897,4.0407,3.8213,4.8503,2.562,4.8,3.2397,1.6127,0.983,0.2738,0.5623,5.6872,1.621,2.1985,5.257,2.6951,4.9689,3.4931,2.3059,2.5784,3.2759,4.5563,0.0173,0.6141,3.7312,0.8805,0.0036,7.1247,1.5375,4.2585,4.7546,5.6062,0.4313,0.813,3.4619,6.4527,0.0077,3.347,2.1108,1.2854,2.2168,0.8004,5.9995,3.8727,0.6821,1.0172,1.4309,4.1115,4.2518,4.9232,0.2505,0.2772,3.1367,2.6224,1.4976,2.0367,3.4016,0.8721,0.9554,2.9135,0.3276,2.6276,0.7005,4.078,1.0105,0.0765,3.1555,0.21,0.5169,0.1591,0.046,2.1143,1.5126,1.6142,0.0005,0.005,9.9592,4.5624,3.0344,3.5334,1.4296,2.7076,2.2067,1.8181,1.8037,0.7253,1.7591,1.5366]}

Many equestrian trainers use their equestrian abilities to guide horses around the landscape which will lead them into different cultures.","token_len":289,"entropy":[8.1725,0.4636,10.1474,2.1411,2.984,11.5575,0.3156,0.4842,1.9679,3.2249,7.4856,1.9815,7.4895,1.2934,7.0425,2.9813,0.4921,5.8355,6.1646,5.2952,1.5173,8.1882,1.5712,9.313,0.1087,2.3346,10.1262,5.9211,0.0807,2.8775,2.3715,3.6677,2.3311,3.7631,0.241,4.7863,5.5948,2.7971,1.1794,0.0009,9.2769,1.2914,0.459,5.8075,0.0747,1.3553,2.0797,1.9226,5.2785,4.3658,1.9465,1.7727,0.0107,0.283,4.6906,4.2992,4.4176,3.2021,1.4291,5.8054,5.0805,7.4827,0.9299,0.9764,4.8329,5.6388,0.4338,3.1381,1.0228,1.9259,1.1806,5.6487,0.3659,1.286,0.0015,10.965,5.6442,0.0306,0.4009,5.4858,0.0339,0.0709,0.0084,0.0018,0.002,0.0016,0.003,0.0022,0.0327,0.0001,0.0005,0.0061,0.0008,0.0003,0.0025,0.0062,0.0004,0.0018,0.0198,0.0023,0.002,0.0006,0.0473,0.0035,0.0131,0.0046,0.0043,0.0026,0.0009,0.0102,0.0079,0.0003,0.0018,0.0039,0.0026,0.0001,0.0005,0.0015,0.0001,0.0044,0.0005,0.0066,0.0228,0.0008,0.0034,0.0005,0.0016,0.0065,0.0023,0.0007,0.0005,0.0009,0.0007,0.0045,0.0133,0.0019,0.0005,0.0011,0.0025,0.0086,0.0008,0.0009,0.077,0.0054,0.0009,0.0247,0.0023,6.9852,4.0483,2.6181,5.8277,1.7947,5.3422,1.3974,0.0157,0.6408,4.6704,7.2286,4.3603,0.4785,0.0874,5.0331,1.823,3.1903,2.7604,4.8791,1.7461,3.6402,0.8671,3.2474,1.6734,4.2902,5.7033,3.3817,1.5761,4.4316,3.921,4.251,2.4663,3.0611,1.0519,1.5834,4.488,0.7773,3.5359,0.4693,3.1815,3.6259,4.9473,3.5082,1.1879,1.9575,0.0002,4.1651,0.3015,0.0025,0.138,0.0006,0.0021,0.0016,0.0018,0.0005,0.0012,0.0017,0.0036,0.0021,0.0038,0.0032,0.0006,0.0024,0.003,0.0032,0.0005,0.0083,0.001,0.0003,0.0008,0.0874,0.0012,0.0007,0.002,0.0005,1.7358,0.1122,2.7583,2.7312,1.4,3.8938,5.7756,0.0937,5.3725,3.5016,5.5769,1.5834,1.5735,0.03,0.4848,2.4424,5.2025,4.0149,4.774,1.4524,3.1827,0.2219,3.6711,4.382,0.0576,5.7093,0.8476,2.9244,2.8845,2.5462,0.2924,4.3513,2.0531,0.0474,2.2352,4.0844,2.0218,4.9255,5.3399,3.4154,0.6327,4.033,2.399,0.007,1.0984,3.634,2.8541,2.0757,3.2226,0.2394,0.0525,3.7289,0.4724,3.639,3.0443,2.1135,2.0839,5.6894,6.7444,4.6518,3.618,1.3154,2.7564,3.9264,3.6351,0.8185]}

Police further said that the two youth were trying to buy two tickets for JNU and were approached by unidentified persons who came out of the vehicle and told them to drop off one of the tickets. Both youths attacked the vehicles by attacking the vehicle with their moped using the machete and other weapons, which were loaded with an assault rifle. The youths had fled from the vehicle and fled after being advised they would be killed and that there was no way to capture them. After the attack some of the crowd allegedly took a truck loaded with stones, tyres and garbage bag from which they allegedly cut out part of the vehicle.

{"id":4880,"ended":true,"length":267,"gen_text":"On December 20, 2009, Warren announced his decision to forgo his final season of collegiate eligibility and enter the 2010 NFL Draft. Warren stated that the NFL's Draft Advisory Board advised him 'tortured' by the new CBA, claiming that he needed to prove his potential as a 'pro' quarterback. On Nov 15, 2009, the NFL informed him that he would enter the 2010 NFL Draft on March 26th, 2009. According to Warren, 'he [the AD Brian Hoyer] wants to make a name for himself and this is where I've got to find my bearings and make new starts.'\"\n\nWarren was forced to miss the entire season of his college career due to various injuries.

For instance, in the first chapter, in the fourth chapter they added missing sentences and corrected the spelling of certain parts of the second section for clarity. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the translations have improved, as well, since the third version was originally published last October. Unfortunately, I have not read and experienced the translation so far.\nIt is a very good story and I hope you consider reading and exploring it. In the meantime please note that the version we have uploaded above will feature many changes which were originally done in 3.11. I would like to thank all who helped us with this translation. I will continue to work to meet the requirements of the new edition, and hopefully with the future release, we will have more English translators working on them, but it would really be great to work together to release what we have. It will also be interesting to see how the content changes during development, so some of the other translations might also benefit from more time! If you know of another translator on the Team, please feel free to send a message to me.\nThe new version of the story was recorded for publication in The Witcher 3 Special Edition.

The hole in wall was also visible and the crater was dug from the top.\n\nAnother visual of the crater has been captured by Krasnodar TV (KTV), which uploaded the video to YouTube: www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Xjk9P5Nc8zS","token_len":295,"entropy":[1.9437,8.0224,3.1861,0.0123,7.2847,1.0279,0.3875,1.7131,0.3074,9.6621,8.6375,2.7073,1.502,1.1684,4.2436,4.9039,2.5075,0.0289,1.8256,8.6986,0.8114,8.7504,1.75,1.4986,2.4224,0.0008,5.4971,4.2269,9.8082,1.692,0.0742,0.0423,2.1795,3.8289,2.8448,2.5345,2.602,0.1328,1.0667,5.9276,2.5365,2.0999,3.0458,5.6371,0.9997,3.2616,1.9085,0.902,4.5754,3.139,1.1379,0.013,0.5693,1.8252,1.5614,0.1819,0.0676,0.0694,0.0016,0.0361,1.1976,6.6135,1.0589,2.062,0.4081,1.2635,1.21,2.396,0.001,0.2467,0.0008,6.5764,3.8616,0.6554,4.8435,0.011,0.1349,0.0361,4.1576,1.0335,5.3565,0.9653,5.3516,4.9574,5.1514,5.1618,0.2845,5.2887,5.162,2.9108,0.5897,4.9233,0.0414,2.5686,0.0489,5.2848,0.0607,2.7003,0.7785,0.2791,0.0003,2.9963,5.7024,5.3091,4.8825,3.5522,0.8656,1.5484,2.9059,3.13,2.103,5.239,0.3608,2.9478,0.0126,0.0435,0.0027,0.0008,0.006,2.3573,1.4021,0.0002,4.0142,5.0908,3.0756,2.5347,1.2836,5.4358,0.4934,2.7517,1.227,0.0253,0.0014,0.0114,0.0007,3.6636,1.4346,0.0041,0.0147,0.0019,0.0006,0.006,1.1,3.857,3.3413,0.4786,1.5654,1.1519,3.8822,3.729,3.6469,2.1393,1.6855,3.3991,3.6778,5.5299,2.0905,1.7701,3.5285,5.7373,4.6455,4.4361,0.5766,0.4764,1.1076,5.677,4.5622,5.223,0.0004,1.3602,1.2291,0.0002,5.1863,3.739,1.048,1.9862,5.2163,3.4252,2.6342,1.6351,4.9756,4.9945,5.2466,0.3184,4.6223,0.0077,0.4783,0.7866,2.1666,0.851,1.3724,4.0412,0.6474,0.9418,3.4867,0.0406,1.7344,1.8807,3.7481,2.8994,4.7344,3.5898,1.8734,0.5927,2.3969,2.3074,1.7726,4.2102,0.8004,4.1713,0.7897,0.4276,3.9916,1.8211,2.7973,2.0587,3.496,0.9051,4.8038,1.5741,4.4104,2.4,1.1114,0.355,1.3093,2.5134,1.2818,2.5107,0.4186,1.3967,4.1052,1.2384,7.24,2.9979,4.7811,3.8234,4.7228,2.4381,2.7973,1.4049,5.5059,3.5827,1.0541,1.955,0.9993,0.7118,0.0002,2.8177,5.998,1.5631,0.5118,1.528,3.8501,0.2902,2.6217,0.5144,5.9351,3.2686,0.1566,0.8358,0.0086,2.2837,3.4332,3.009,2.6796,2.0079,1.3244,5.8648,1.2637,1.3084,1.9423,0.6551,3.7292,7.9651,0.0011,0.4159,0.0006,0.0014,0.0042,0.1005,0.0022,0.0079,0.0189,4.0148,4.1441,4.197,3.8657,4.4856,3.7199,4.4759,4.1508,3.9947,4.4256,4.5498]}

The tombs may also belong to other long-lived individuals, such as Thomas Nesby's Fussell's Lodge.\n\nA group of researchers, including Dr. Stephen Rensy, University of Victoria, have already investigated some of the earliest burial sites with the use of radiocarbon dating.

The site is believed to have included Bausa Bay, one of the most populated places on Earth, and there are believed to have also been grave sites such as the Great Wall of China, where early Barrows lived. The tombstones were found in a small area on a small hilltop on a cliff, about 5 metres long, about 2.5 metres high.

{"id":797,"ended":false,"length":262,"gen_text":"Erected as a permanent memorial to the men of Oldham who were killed in the First World War, Oldham's war memorial consists of a granite base surmounted by a bronze sculpture depicting five prominent military regiments that are represented by their respective red, green and blue stripes, along with memorials with images of their deceased commanders. During the Cold War, the monument's dedication was celebrated as part of the War Memorials Memorial Scheme.\n\nOldham's monument commemorated the six men of Oldham who were injured in the First World War and were put on display on 5 May 1942, when the Allied forces launched Operation Barbarossa. This led to their deaths in the Korean War and their memorial service was cancelled on 9 May 1945. Although Oldham was a 'war memorial', this memorial was not one of those commemorating military veterans who died in the Battle of Verdun. During the Korean War, this was also an event commemorating those who fought together against the Japanese and the Korean People's Army.

{"id":2945,"ended":true,"length":276,"gen_text":"Upon finishing his role as artist on Solipskier, Wohlwend wanted to experiment with game programming by designing his own game. He developed Hundreds from an idea he had while staring at a ceiling, and in one short iteration he created new gameplay elements utilizing many of the same technology he was developing when designing Minecraft. With his experience developing games for publishers, Wohlwend found inspiration from a couple of early game development studios, and created the original Minecraft. This game eventually landed his first game, The World.\n\nHe created a second version, The Black Keys, at the company's headquarters, and became the new CEO, after being elected by President Obama. Following that, he stepped down from his position as CEO and started playing for EA\/Virtually Everything with Tim Murphy. While designing The World for EA, Wohlwend found himself writing more and more code to the upcoming MMO, which was launched this month.\n\nIn recent years, Wohlwend has seen some development work involving the Starcraft, and there's a new game, Black Ops 2, called The World of the Black Ops. Currently, he's focused on creating a game for EA and on other platforms. As for some new stuff, Wohlwend is building his own game (we'll be releasing a free demo in the coming months), writing some test mods, which will ship on June 29th, and then will be released on PS3, iPad, Android, Linux, and Mac.","token_len":303,"entropy":[10.2711,2.8571,5.922,0.6461,8.8206,2.1808,10.718,5.6308,6.7432,8.5358,1.4078,6.3662,6.0055,6.2136,4.4701,5.7124,0.131,6.8174,0.4049,7.2022,6.0068,4.3918,4.81,2.6217,0.1395,2.6661,1.5573,1.8353,4.5511,14.3806,5.7675,4.5377,2.5388,0.9235,0.6743,4.0148,9.3202,0.6273,0.9492,6.5061,2.5339,1.4465,4.2912,4.5905,4.0906,5.628,1.8906,1.7174,6.2938,4.6663,1.4068,7.0782,5.0506,0.5531,0.6906,1.6013,5.1873,2.1699,2.4762,1.5485,4.1418,1.9386,6.103,0.3383,4.5818,2.4526,4.329,4.1158,1.5707,1.9133,4.4736,1.1685,1.2115,0.0018,0.005,0.0026,3.3857,3.0496,1.5978,2.855,4.5753,0.1514,4.4045,3.2201,1.8876,3.6181,1.348,1.361,3.7433,2.0816,3.7957,3.7406,2.8636,4.3137,1.6454,5.1283,4.6288,4.273,1.4277,1.8443,0.9147,2.7329,4.5713,3.6549,0.8767,0.0032,4.2493,3.885,1.9005,4.2128,2.9065,2.5731,0.943,5.7155,5.2122,0.3499,4.7402,1.2011,5.8279,0.4258,2.9007,2.1799,1.7137,4.9888,1.9118,5.6091,1.8918,2.4019,4.3096,3.5706,3.1932,2.0751,5.8237,2.5623,0.8062,5.1969,2.2016,0.5838,0.636,5.4759,0.0584,1.2576,1.5434,0.6787,0.5475,0.7685,1.996,3.7438,5.9223,3.7423,5.0408,6.3278,3.9079,3.196,0.5075,2.3337,5.628,5.5505,5.2234,0.8302,4.2068,6.08,1.8699,0.832,2.8947,0.461,0.9812,0.5024,0.0006,0.0025,0.0019,3.2601,1.9923,4.665,4.7464,1.1984,0.0508,2.0173,2.7824,3.7611,6.5916,4.0215,1.5898,3.4095,1.86,4.1482,2.9427,2.3369,0.6385,0.8054,0.0001,2.9268,4.9775,0.8202,0.1897,0.6302,0.0018,0.0048,0.0018,0.3485,4.4417,3.0015,4.9983,2.9159,5.3564,2.6982,7.4152,3.2327,3.4414,5.3257,1.8926,1.8577,3.3946,1.756,2.4972,5.1374,1.7467,1.7082,0.8297,5.4443,2.84,3.6213,2.0866,4.7498,2.5791,1.3099,1.2113,5.565,0.4161,1.9288,0.6059,3.5815,0.2928,2.4877,1.5695,2.0839,2.477,3.0163,2.57,5.9359,3.8766,3.3312,1.0932,4.1508,2.1652,5.9917,4.0599,4.5867,0.651,1.7408,0.0009,0.0042,0.0035,1.7263,5.7278,2.5683,0.495,2.4187,5.723,5.3112,0.9005,2.6061,3.6778,1.4292,4.2838,2.1627,2.8678,0.925,1.4983,1.5245,0.9247,6.8236,3.2849,5.8438,5.628,0.9037,6.5502,1.7399,6.0723,2.4128,3.5015,3.2192,0.7492,1.3604,0.5303,3.0487,4.6415,0.7872,1.2559,0.9966,4.7123,1.8901,1.5237,5.2669,0.2467,3.0688,0.5381,5.2878,0.2543,0.8812,2.8824,0.549]}

Moore, IBM's associate director of policy development, has been quoted as saying : \" [t]he [ IBM ] conference is a public-private partnership and the main reason for this is to offer the company support for scientific development in the new country, and have an enormous impact on the economic development of America. To this end, I am very much convinced that it has to be done, with complete transparency, on what we want our work to achieve. This has long been the theme of conferences such as the Stanford and the MIT Conference.\" Mr. Moore also told us that IBM would make the conference a part of the MIT Institute for Information and Social Problems and that it would not have the financial support to do so. But his statement did not explain why the conference might not have given any funding for the university.

{"id":1399,"ended":true,"length":305,"gen_text":"The Omaha Traction Company, which operated as the Street Railway Company, changed its name to the Omaha Transit Company when streetcar service ended in the city in 1952. After World War II, the railroad opened in Omaha for the first time in 1973. During the 1950s, Omaha continued its long-distance lines into the future and was designated the Lincoln-Hicketts Corridor Corridor as part of the city's development plan. During the 1950s and 60s, the highway and railroad system was upgraded to allow for the construction and operations of more rapid railroad passenger services. However, it is interesting to ponder the current state of transportation services in Omaha. On the other hand, one thing most of us don't know is how much money it has since been spent, with an average daily use of over 75 miles per year now. This has led to the misconception that transportation in general has become a huge expense, with many people working an average of 5 hours a week to care for one and never having any money to pay, and there is so much congestion and the cost of providing transportation, so some of the costs have increased with time. However, the reality is that the city and county governments will continue moving towards some new transportation strategies like higher speeds, longer lines and safer, freer routes. In particular, the City of Omaha recently announced that all traffic congestion, which will impact public safety, will now only be reduced by the $5.25 billion increase in the minimum wage and $3.25 billion in the increase of minimum wages over the next two years due to changes in public funding.","token_len":320,"entropy":[12.5819,10.6717,3.2762,3.8901,1.6918,2.2272,3.5215,4.5814,1.1446,9.5524,4.3075,0.8172,1.5101,7.2023,0.6005,0.0713,0.4382,0.8615,2.1566,5.2749,0.6011,4.1232,9.113,1.0657,3.8026,0.506,2.9207,5.8937,1.0838,5.5291,0.1938,5.0312,4.3952,0.0014,0.039,0.1509,0.6339,3.2143,5.0006,2.255,2.3264,3.6768,1.1859,0.1646,0.0033,1.1675,3.937,0.6234,5.0195,0.7629,3.7276,0.1385,0.49,3.7858,4.5046,1.9132,3.9792,0.8261,2.0175,6.3033,3.6892,0.7733,4.1951,2.5092,3.1008,4.7071,1.279,4.4832,2.9402,3.0227,3.3453,3.6022,2.5563,3.5349,4.375,1.0332,0.0006,0.3274,3.3031,0.2968,5.8626,0.6997,0.5279,4.332,0.4102,3.2862,0.0113,2.0036,2.9239,0.0157,0.087,0.7369,5.9962,3.3945,2.2567,2.6803,1.4461,4.2965,1.0486,4.185,1.2939,2.1126,2.1465,2.9527,4.5875,0.0139,2.8694,3.8658,4.5193,4.9506,3.4638,0.6321,4.586,0.0054,3.6161,2.2989,4.9135,0.0631,7.9899,1.1129,4.2248,1.535,0.0284,2.9697,4.0622,0.3978,0.5996,0.9059,5.3142,1.3074,2.7825,0.1116,0.0111,4.4896,3.9257,5.8329,2.0656,0.6348,3.2405,0.0006,0.8587,0.7059,1.493,1.5415,1.6907,3.5794,3.4999,4.9144,1.1823,0.3864,3.4265,4.6288,3.9245,0.693,3.8499,4.8523,0.2823,3.755,5.2739,3.0092,1.1158,1.6188,6.2448,1.3839,3.3138,3.3716,1.3246,0.4756,1.7553,4.067,0.0592,3.2458,2.5699,4.4057,1.6579,2.4769,1.669,5.1838,1.6441,2.0814,2.1581,2.9673,1.7496,4.6522,5.2765,0.8708,0.0671,4.7291,1.2015,0.5953,1.2336,2.5798,4.2929,0.005,3.7512,4.8893,4.9658,2.3503,3.514,1.3778,1.1288,2.1069,5.794,2.191,4.4424,0.9354,5.1701,0.2364,4.6905,1.9861,4.5633,2.3852,0.2018,4.6217,2.1096,3.1976,5.0993,5.638,2.1214,0.9146,4.1048,2.7823,3.3918,4.0352,2.6621,0.5427,3.0243,0.013,2.0562,2.9204,0.1645,0.2661,1.9926,3.4449,3.8817,3.1128,2.3689,5.6821,1.4746,7.3237,3.6314,5.4315,4.7052,1.6228,4.0214,5.7999,5.0726,3.0082,0.8086,4.2282,1.7181,1.4649,5.27,3.281,5.8517,0.3537,2.4701,0.8586,2.776,3.8943,0.0516,1.3797,3.2299,0.2487,0.0722,4.0597,2.0552,1.122,4.9442,4.6993,5.9676,4.157,3.5296,3.6668,5.4115,5.0881,0.9107,0.9521,0.6146,4.138,4.0256,0.5904,2.7802,0.4439,2.6371,5.4347,3.3015,1.5801,3.1911,2.6031,3.6184,0.2571,1.5923,4.1426,1.6443,2.7829,2.2266,3.1364,0.1938,1.3399,0.8099,0.8949,1.2223,4.4572,3.5524,4.251,1.8359,4.0137,0.699,0.0989,2.2546,0.1985,6.075,0.0253,4.8622,0.4289,4.4785,3.3484,0.7144]}

{"id":4891,"ended":false,"length":304,"gen_text":"Meat has been traded at Smithfield Market for more than 800 years, making it one of the oldest markets in London. A livestock market occupied the site as early as the 10th century, and since the mid-1800s there have been several attempts to sell livestock to farmers around London. In 2003 Dr Lopis, a farmer in the south-east, moved to the new Market, and the new Market is run by the same team that once had been the market for chickens. The new Market is designed to cater for the high demand for poultry, giving people living on low incomes what is best for their chickens, and offering a rich supply of cheap, locally grown food. To this day poultry have become a hugely popular food for customers since 1968. In a recent poll A.D. Poll said: \"I do not know what to think of the current situation in the UK with poultry products, or with the possible future of poultry supply\". But while the situation is precarious and some producers are working harder to get people to purchase poultry they are also feeling under pressure to make their products sustainable and available for sale. A recently survey found that the public is turning against the idea of having more chickens - as some argue that the number of chickens being grown has fallen from 80 per cent of the population in 1984 to around 15 per cent today. When asked: Which species will the rest of us buy now? 3% of the population will buy chicken, whilst 20% go for a range of other types of animal.\n\n\nMolecular Biology in Modern Markets, London, \u00a310.00","token_len":321,"entropy":[5.3206,1.484,8.5252,2.9393,9.4766,0.614,3.8351,1.58,3.2564,0.0208,6.5465,2.5042,1.4358,4.2271,0.3094,0.9943,0.0077,0.1932,1.5748,2.4439,0.1778,4.9347,0.4039,4.6059,10.6126,1.8973,10.4744,1.6094,2.667,5.1164,1.0771,0.0031,1.6471,4.3022,0.054,0.1186,1.2533,1.2344,5.0988,1.9624,2.5402,0.2145,2.6824,0.0306,3.2216,0.6067,0.0564,2.3749,3.7769,0.3742,3.0745,2.2481,2.2579,2.8101,4.191,3.0659,0.3999,2.8727,5.1594,7.4703,5.3922,4.8549,4.9905,1.7923,1.5215,3.5524,1.4752,2.0325,3.9905,1.3122,0.3828,1.7049,4.4969,1.0509,1.3554,4.197,2.8567,1.4964,1.7078,2.4031,3.5438,3.0358,1.5373,5.2694,0.2549,1.8821,2.685,2.4071,1.535,4.5527,3.852,3.304,1.8069,3.0083,1.428,4.7652,0.7034,2.1048,1.6948,0.9756,1.0566,4.6475,0.4186,2.6711,1.0537,1.3711,5.4113,0.3819,0.9789,2.4856,1.6006,6.1683,3.6157,5.0928,2.7386,2.5035,0.222,5.1535,2.2917,5.1631,1.509,1.3347,3.4412,2.2348,1.0542,3.7616,1.4337,5.4975,3.2346,0.119,3.7652,2.2113,1.7646,0.7709,2.1165,0.5984,6.037,3.641,1.633,5.3176,6.1625,2.4423,1.0218,5.1717,0.5264,1.3551,2.1789,5.0712,7.1325,6.7214,1.0137,3.1518,3.4674,1.7285,2.3377,6.8499,4.0778,3.0845,0.2627,5.4021,3.9468,1.6211,0.2406,3.3311,3.8534,0.3891,2.3301,2.1825,1.8565,1.8324,0.7781,1.0816,3.168,1.9384,1.2931,1.3666,1.7978,3.8047,2.8032,5.2745,2.0901,3.0964,2.417,1.6417,5.5928,1.7665,0.9859,2.4023,6.1383,3.0734,4.1125,4.357,1.6057,4.7344,1.3535,5.5323,3.1693,3.8258,4.6274,1.2209,5.1977,3.8778,0.549,3.0882,5.0855,0.4387,4.1616,2.8205,3.1608,1.19,2.3212,5.5769,4.4115,0.5761,1.0387,3.2474,3.2966,1.2812,4.2559,1.5867,4.6392,1.7417,2.9463,0.5378,3.3438,5.7258,5.4597,2.4489,0.3576,2.9843,4.18,2.1315,5.3214,0.8961,1.4943,3.2159,0.3828,4.9064,2.5922,2.1295,4.7048,3.9281,4.1893,3.5067,1.2725,1.8384,4.145,0.2017,0.9538,2.745,3.7758,3.0648,2.4994,3.0706,4.4989,2.2614,0.0134,0.8448,0.6259,0.9647,0.6164,4.5483,0.3331,3.0435,2.5334,0.0415,0.002,0.8719,0.1614,5.6274,1.4012,5.6276,5.3542,5.0964,4.063,3.3983,5.7274,0.0797,1.3035,3.418,4.6336,0.5488,5.3482,2.7993,0.877,1.192,0.9205,2.852,1.0687,2.34,1.358,4.6435,3.824,0.8205,6.1558,0.6355,2.8287,3.111,0.0428,0.4208,3.3527,0.5158,3.9752,0.8728,5.6251,0.0004,5.6992,4.5375,1.6555,2.9314,4.8134,3.9559,4.544,4.0247,2.784,1.4237,4.7953,3.0346,0.6404,1.4268]}

However, after he made his debut, he never returned to the club and has taken to working at the Rovers shop.\n\nHe also recently made his debut for Chelsea in the 2015-16 season, and won the league in his first year with the Blues.\n\nWe hope your journey to England is a good one, where you might even enjoy some amazing moments: www.johnnytansports.co.uk\n\nIf you would like to learn more about the game, and find out more about what we are doing and what it has got to offer, please visit our page as well.","token_len":323,"entropy":[8.5926,13.3332,8.491,6.3927,10.2177,0.0312,2.9957,2.6149,1.1145,5.8534,1.7136,1.6995,0.1361,0.0032,0.6714,5.4184,9.5569,3.2196,2.969,5.5333,7.7976,2.2653,1.3105,0.528,9.9931,0.0012,2.698,8.9226,5.4519,0.092,2.6555,1.7502,12.2724,4.6996,7.5022,2.6236,9.2466,0.5626,0.123,10.1311,5.1247,4.9715,0.0009,3.0297,2.455,8.4027,18.246,4.3404,3.1211,0.0012,5.495,2.392,2.8837,0.471,0.8532,0.3468,4.3848,2.1307,2.0687,2.8589,1.819,5.8728,6.8726,0.0004,3.1687,0.9854,3.1134,2.3026,2.5561,3.8133,4.6394,1.1518,5.8642,4.0294,0.5799,0.5228,1.2433,4.0751,3.927,4.2979,3.4519,2.1377,1.4228,3.2994,1.1802,4.9554,5.0462,4.3018,0.0492,0.3661,0.7528,0.9184,2.0848,4.3417,1.3409,5.9476,4.9236,0.8009,0.4876,3.2005,4.1233,1.0612,3.0361,0.003,2.9482,2.8007,4.5892,1.5781,5.5395,2.7476,1.4937,2.7509,0.0024,1.1792,1.8154,1.5035,2.1322,1.9187,5.6761,4.8024,0.7146,0.8201,1.2833,1.9178,2.1685,5.2141,0.3886,5.9733,1.0291,0.8021,0.0122,5.1126,1.0658,3.9944,0.0434,3.2448,0.2928,0.4744,2.7854,1.5087,3.6904,1.2152,0.59,1.977,4.515,0.0058,3.239,0.1161,2.386,0.1815,0.2433,0.0245,0.0022,0.2847,2.1623,1.455,1.3284,4.0578,1.8632,3.3522,4.8067,1.3636,3.6296,2.5727,0.2069,5.0858,2.5232,5.565,2.24,0.7943,0.0002,5.1532,5.9034,4.5033,4.4157,3.7623,0.5142,1.66,4.6849,1.9268,3.4849,4.2525,1.1674,4.3888,4.6225,0.5363,1.2764,1.5018,1.1776,5.6337,0.5424,0.695,1.4363,4.8454,0.4959,3.9725,1.9713,0.8005,2.8486,0.1528,3.3022,3.3844,3.9227,1.0928,1.8447,2.5714,0.8667,5.3948,4.0069,0.3531,0.975,1.3245,2.5097,2.8739,5.9914,2.0426,4.6257,2.6196,1.544,4.9582,0.0492,5.6575,1.0336,0.5549,0.0002,2.0209,3.1889,3.895,3.6328,0.7713,1.7893,0.7969,5.6519,1.5235,0.7651,4.5621,0.8799,0.0674,0.7426,0.559,1.2896,4.2503,0.7083,3.2323,3.0086,1.4509,0.5327,2.4286,1.9788,0.4532,1.4608,0.4854,0.8862,0.0002,5.024,3.3975,4.1735,3.7115,2.1074,4.5597,1.689,1.9426,3.4519,0.0158,1.4809,6.8125,0.4079,5.6046,4.8251,3.3737,1.7629,6.0806,2.1175,5.7608,6.6583,0.002,5.3984,3.3029,4.5781,4.4601,1.954,0.15,1.101,0.0027,0.001,1.5461,0.0003,3.5111,0.1004,2.3366,0.0232,0.072,3.4047,0.0876,0.1056,1.8423,3.3006,1.5246,3.8746,4.0075,0.3669,0.4548,0.096,3.8619,2.1151,1.665,0.8897,3.9625,1.1682,3.239,4.0384,6.2854,0.0482,0.0515,0.4203,1.3599,1.371,1.0284,4.198,6.1719,1.1967,0.9828]}

The foundation is the new City of Toronto Public Services Building. On the northeast corner of the site are the following:\n\nCity Centre Plaza for the Arts and Industry - An architectural legacy of the historic CCR site for over 400 years.\n\nCopia Square for Historic Design - a civic icon with a long history of cultural use, including the landmark park and the popular art galleries, and the history of the site. As part of its development plan, Civic Centre Plaza is designed to have a high level of interplay between public art and historical context, both for artists and for the public. A pedestrian walk from Copia Square to the plaza provides a short walk through the park, but there is no access to the City's Museum of Modern Art. When the Park was restored in 2011, the park was renovated into condos, and the current owners invested substantial capital money in the newly refurbished lot.

This swing @ - @ by maneuver was not intended as an attempt to collect the orbiting objects or observe the bright lights of Saturn's rings.\n\nWith its massive 13.1-m diameter orbit, the Galileo spacecraft orbited the Sun as it traversed the solar system, bringing up over 7.5 million kilometers before it was knocked aside. This incredible velocity made the Solar Flux and Cislosan spacecraft invisible from Earth-like telescopes.\n\nToday's Galileo spacecraft has an orbit of 462,600 kilometers (230,000 miles) away from Earth on a trajectory that has since shifted to our planet's west. This flight represents an important milestone in our understanding of the solar system, and shows what the future will look like.\n\nThe new telescope will also be its most powerful instrument to date. The Galileo spacecraft is capable of measuring the distance, angular velocity, solar mass and mass ratio between light and radio, so it has the ability to track a wide variety of objects, even in the same orbit. The telescope will further accelerate its sensitivity and improve the search for elusive exoplanets and life-forms.\n\nGalileo's new telescope will serve as the cornerstone for further exploration of the solar system, with the latest mission under development.\n\nExplore further: NASA's Juno mission has sent a human to Mars\n\nMore information: A Galileo spacecraft has captured two very distant stars.

{"id":2166,"ended":true,"length":256,"gen_text":"The Amylostereaceae are white rot pathogens. They disintegrate the lignin of the host wood, whereby the infested wood parts become less stable and take a fibrous structure. The wood bleaches as fungal spores and makes it difficult for the host to kill or reproduce. The amylostereus is able to make up for this by destroying and spreading fungus infested with the leaves of the amylostereus but with less potency than the lichen fungi due to their relatively low potency. Amylostereus is typically considered an aphrodisiac cultivar due to its low and low resistance to disease and the fact that it is easy to eat. On the other hand, lichen fungi that are resistant to amylostereus are more readily produced. In particular, lichen amylostereus is more beneficial than many chrysanthemums and can be a potent aphrodisiac agent for many disease syndromes, but it also has the opposite effect on aphrodisiac plants. As part of its research, a team led by Charles Hays at the University of California Santa Barbara found that lichen amylostereus is capable of destroying and killing lichen fungi from the lignin of the lignin of a host wood when it is infested with a resistant lichen nematode. Additionally, research by Hays and two colleagues in the National Academy of Sciences revealed that the amylostereus has been used as an aphrodisiac agent in the lab for the past 35 years and in a wide range of other applications as well.","token_len":330,"entropy":[8.7843,6.1671,9.3198,7.113,9.1739,2.4345,7.6194,9.2831,10.5667,2.0145,1.5008,12.2057,0.0044,4.5612,5.6179,1.1888,0.1756,4.202,2.0265,5.4529,6.8924,1.6932,9.262,1.5826,7.1021,2.307,1.1666,7.6949,2.2895,5.7694,4.369,0.913,6.1534,3.7424,12.0562,0.0345,4.0816,1.1985,1.6557,5.1233,9.5717,4.6752,4.2567,8.294,0.0073,1.8896,1.9154,5.4728,1.9225,0.8699,0.5866,1.0719,2.1015,0.5078,4.6594,3.2433,3.1091,0.3398,1.8024,3.5647,0.0074,0.1334,0.0483,3.6186,1.2582,5.7659,0.0066,5.0889,3.8287,1.2688,0.774,0.6457,4.3865,3.2711,4.3425,4.4453,5.0251,0.1639,2.0877,1.8233,6.2418,0.6057,0.8294,1.9785,0.007,0.088,0.0184,0.2762,6.4509,3.6405,2.5896,5.9215,1.4832,1.064,4.483,0.2234,4.5006,6.0364,0.0145,1.2373,3.7007,1.4373,2.4126,0.3966,3.0852,0.0042,0.0519,0.0256,0.1807,2.3755,5.5793,4.2746,3.0894,3.6939,0.2963,0.0112,0.0005,5.9383,0.0388,2.8477,0.0301,0.4057,2.8323,5.2353,2.6521,3.7421,0.083,3.347,1.8107,2.7695,1.5899,0.097,0.521,1.1653,4.5297,0.0904,5.4887,0.8185,6.3888,0.3029,0.1582,0.0097,0.081,1.366,0.0541,1.6337,3.7151,1.2429,1.624,0.0425,0.9098,0.0013,0.0176,0.012,0.1329,1.4119,1.9806,5.1964,4.1993,1.6978,3.0775,4.9726,0.0775,1.4371,0.032,3.3853,0.0408,0.328,0.0489,0.1267,1.324,2.2926,5.4522,1.9753,4.3005,6.5835,0.8486,0.5046,0.0012,0.1046,2.3065,4.217,0.993,3.9154,3.4204,0.542,0.0041,0.0059,0.003,4.0011,2.5567,3.3486,5.561,4.8532,0.0086,0.0002,3.039,3.8561,1.6476,2.9591,1.3545,2.1002,5.1342,0.3422,1.3913,3.8743,0.0907,0.0298,0.1467,2.25,0.7906,4.2919,5.378,0.0011,1.6618,5.6622,0.8947,3.7271,1.1902,2.4635,0.0041,4.9989,3.7475,4.8696,2.62,0.7178,0.4462,0.0055,2.1091,4.1816,0.5249,3.8596,0.2714,1.3578,0.0163,0.5822,0.0018,0.008,0.007,0.0175,2.2765,4.1545,0.0057,2.9415,2.3091,2.4483,3.7289,0.0843,2.1812,4.067,1.6477,4.0674,0.0148,0.053,0.4241,1.0497,3.2147,0.0697,0.1106,0.9366,2.2728,2.5536,1.983,5.0827,1.3625,0.7181,4.3027,0.0044,0.3104,2.3778,5.5571,2.6668,0.0015,5.6231,0.018,0.2042,0.7785,5.6449,0.0126,5.1465,2.0071,2.9793,0.0273,0.3582,6.4416,0.7263,2.7595,1.749,5.4234,2.1608,0.0478,0.0269,3.6043,0.1286,1.7993,1.8527,0.0025,0.0338,0.0139,0.1,4.1903,2.5833,2.4352,1.6512,1.2222,0.2972,0.0029,0.0064,0.0057,1.3518,1.2991,2.1361,4.4381,1.0914,2.9268,1.3362,4.7725,0.0229,1.9398,4.0915,2.7053,4.0759,0.8932,0.005,1.7951,2.8606,3.1549,0.5992,0.1548]}

Some lakes in the North Lakes and Mid-Ohio are the main source of river runoff.\n\nRelated Resources\n\n\nMozones in North Country: A Comparative History\n\nStories of River Trails in North America: A History","token_len":331,"entropy":[9.8913,10.0375,7.5419,5.9181,0.3145,3.5964,6.6418,0.0453,4.3337,3.4258,8.5915,2.1583,9.2481,0.1095,1.5555,3.5495,4.3796,0.835,0.7608,4.6574,1.0984,3.4663,3.057,5.1836,3.3126,5.0305,5.6064,5.9946,0.2204,1.1972,5.7533,2.9235,4.7662,4.0959,4.3639,1.1492,1.952,0.7034,5.2424,5.7666,2.1305,4.1834,1.1701,0.9236,0.5692,2.5896,1.0834,4.5227,3.9903,1.3231,0.6342,1.7475,2.5502,2.1262,5.9613,4.5057,0.0185,0.1647,1.6204,1.4745,2.6402,3.489,3.7394,3.5995,0.7437,0.7978,0.0005,9.0269,6.5936,0.9753,0.0152,0.2328,0.004,0.01,0.0272,0.0146,0.0004,0.0006,0.0081,0.0302,0.0028,0.0075,1.1856,2.2437,4.5388,1.8843,4.0318,3.0757,0.5946,1.0017,1.8593,3.2135,4.4923,3.1814,5.1533,2.7952,3.913,5.1576,5.0232,1.4833,2.0326,2.0853,0.4978,0.0093,1.6766,2.3,4.0741,2.5301,3.6094,6.9913,3.8566,2.7873,1.006,2.9312,1.9829,1.2698,0.1195,3.4274,5.3339,0.0197,1.8003,4.4586,5.2347,3.8538,2.077,2.7642,5.311,1.2751,2.3971,5.7414,2.2841,0.0225,0.956,0.2603,0.9977,1.3036,3.095,5.5125,0.9884,4.8624,0.9685,5.4325,5.1157,1.3082,1.6769,1.3301,2.0888,6.4112,2.6787,0.925,1.1293,0.4441,1.7943,0.9417,6.5192,1.1326,3.1463,6.0323,3.2034,1.3951,2.0289,2.2384,4.5766,0.5952,0.1691,0.0172,1.0092,0.7089,0.0002,6.5504,4.0244,0.6038,0.0051,0.0009,0.122,2.2242,2.9135,0.0058,0.0011,0.0019,0.0088,0.0018,2.844,0.4877,0.0006,0.0005,0.1024,0.6293,0.0025,0.0011,0.0031,0.0074,0.0049,0.0014,0.0036,0.0045,0.0025,4.4787,6.9816,0.5691,0.0319,0.0006,0.1013,0.0016,0.0029,0.0027,0.0001,0.0032,0.0052,0.0008,0.0011,0.0024,0.0017,0.0014,0.0036,0.0016,0.0211,0.0001,0.0005,0.0027,0.0009,0.0007,0.009,0.0026,0.0003,0.0016,0.0038,0.0009,0.0067,0.0004,0.0006,0.0028,0.0013,0.023,0.0479,0.0018,0.0028,0.0133,0.0039,0.0033,0.0027,0.0009,0.1541,0.0007,0.0065,0.0008,0.0002,0.0006,0.0003,0.001,0.0018,0.0215,0.0009,0.007,0.0029,0.0005,0.0139,0.0008,0.002,0.0019,0.0004,0.0008,0.0975,0.0005,0.0064,0.0021,0.0,0.0048,0.0056,0.0027,0.0007,0.006,0.0018,0.0006,0.0005,0.0151,0.0023,0.0011,0.0018,0.0004,0.0002,0.0006,4.4758,3.0042,1.6779,0.8441,1.9848,6.0376,3.0481,4.7989,0.5177,2.4669,2.5172,4.53,3.1631,1.0843,0.066,4.1016,2.722,0.8688,2.3705,0.0002,5.6878,3.2678,4.4922,0.0003,4.7795,4.3153,3.4608,3.0018,3.7667,7.3909,2.4169,2.984,5.7495,0.0291,2.663,1.0738,0.0002,5.5287,3.7623,1.0873,4.6037,5.5814,1.2981,1.7628,0.1437,3.1119,1.5814,1.9971]}

His entire book, \" The Great American Scandal \" is a portrait of not only some of the real problems faced by the average American, but of our current government (and others). The most striking criticism is the fact that, like every American hero (and, at the start of the book is one), he doesn't just point out the shortcomings of our government; he argues that we are so far ahead of others that we should do better. The book is clear, and I don't think Brooks is done yet.","token_len":333,"entropy":[6.9724,3.7715,4.7255,0.5343,10.1933,6.9635,11.0364,2.0933,1.9587,2.0938,0.9619,4.3294,0.7766,5.418,6.5007,8.3753,0.1078,1.7049,7.4746,3.0743,0.3728,0.4678,6.0542,9.7339,19.5601,9.034,6.7634,11.5859,3.9952,1.5825,0.7493,5.626,1.965,0.0919,2.0476,0.9215,2.9735,0.5048,1.8096,4.9276,2.7508,0.0253,5.7444,5.0056,2.8457,2.3609,4.2783,3.8307,1.1007,2.662,4.3443,2.7842,3.3773,3.5942,3.6625,5.1455,0.3283,0.2153,4.595,1.6184,5.2188,2.6655,4.6584,0.9416,2.6066,1.8815,5.5443,2.6412,2.5932,1.3069,3.0148,1.0045,1.6317,0.005,3.5113,5.8996,1.0249,2.0775,5.4673,1.5169,5.1483,0.1162,5.4942,6.4876,4.2226,0.011,5.4722,2.0966,0.6366,4.9665,5.5104,1.8518,3.9664,3.2477,5.8574,0.2946,3.8225,3.6252,2.9986,3.0335,6.245,3.8694,3.1197,1.3487,0.4027,0.0001,2.3017,4.7101,1.8979,3.0419,1.9185,1.4504,0.1191,4.2479,2.3631,3.1138,3.3969,2.687,4.5626,0.5062,1.2801,2.0435,0.0002,3.4786,5.3794,0.1406,2.9175,1.6989,0.0178,4.8161,2.993,5.0492,2.297,0.6684,0.4446,3.9223,5.2452,3.6569,3.9874,1.9034,0.7063,0.4492,0.0002,2.6907,5.0386,4.238,2.5645,1.7835,4.5849,6.4863,1.086,2.7619,3.8496,0.0016,4.9297,3.0844,3.4651,0.1541,2.8026,4.3426,0.2176,3.7416,1.816,3.4784,5.5956,1.8673,1.5327,3.4479,1.8487,4.0398,4.4945,2.8101,2.3863,4.5739,0.0379,5.5634,3.1032,3.6684,0.5816,1.9531,1.3737,1.2114,2.8236,3.0649,2.157,4.4041,5.2302,5.2719,3.5856,0.2097,3.552,0.1786,0.092,1.0501,2.5462,3.3305,0.0002,1.8421,0.0451,0.0002,3.4395,6.181,2.4136,1.0011,1.2134,5.0621,2.0696,2.6234,0.8405,0.6986,1.6468,2.7584,3.9621,2.9131,3.4589,0.4333,0.5088,4.3601,4.4435,1.5615,1.1839,4.0536,5.8405,1.1152,5.0453,3.0061,0.9693,4.6897,5.0724,1.3391,2.2765,2.6555,5.7381,0.5127,0.0636,0.0091,0.0001,2.3389,1.4034,1.8832,5.3202,0.0425,6.7575,0.755,5.4062,0.8972,0.3411,6.5791,1.148,3.5577,0.1604,0.7972,7.135,0.3364,0.4429,0.0593,1.9077,4.505,2.8655,2.5556,4.5339,1.4789,5.0527,1.5685,3.1823,4.5444,4.3097,4.3004,1.9361,3.0806,2.8829,0.0231,3.0944,4.1365,4.681,2.4128,5.6429,4.2473,1.266,2.8887,4.0923,1.6322,5.7892,0.2175,0.6434,0.178,6.079,3.4824,2.4453,1.9291,3.3528,0.0008,3.8137,5.1076,0.6571,1.2055,3.674,0.3154,2.2014,1.2649,3.1721,0.2447,4.026,0.9142,2.1326,2.1002,3.3816,3.6082,1.9183,0.2546,4.4433,0.4751,0.6286,1.9919,4.1717,2.4698,0.4,3.4603,1.8338,1.5225,5.6176,2.5438,2.2534,2.8203,3.8729,0.0006,1.0498,1.7329,1.6454,5.5292,1.8619,0.367]}

As far as I can tell, no one has taken my suggestion seriously, so some of the other sources I have read make no such claim. I know of no studies on the matter. As for some fungi that were not cooked too tender, I know from personal experience that very little is known of them.\n\nIn the meantime, I have been keeping up the work in the United States and Europe, conducting studies on mushroom consumption, and working on the question of how to make mushrooms that were not cooked too tender for a few hours in a dish.

O 'Malley had his transition team, and had them compile policy briefs and schedule meetings that are the basis for major development efforts. During the campaign, O'Malley's office noted that he did not plan to hold the city's job in the next couple of months, and he would have to work on the county budget before being elected.\n\nThe mayor's transition team also considered using the City Council on a project to replace vacant government offices that had been vacant for years and for new offices to have been built. This new structure has been identified as being most compatible with their plans for future development. O 'Malley announced the process to begin with, the mayor's spokesperson said.\n\nThe transition staff asked what would happen under the current tax laws, and they suggested that the tax system was less than perfect, but it would make the changes easier and cheaper than the current tax system. They also urged that the tax system also be used to meet local financial needs. O 'Malley said his decision was made based on the priorities in the law as well as the way O'Malley approached his administration.\n\nAfter the election, O'Malley promised to keep working for New South Wales in the State Parliament. His spokesperson, however, also explained that O'Malley only became a member when he became mayor. At the State Senate, the senator sent a letter to O'Malley thanking him for the position at the end of his term, and that the mayor would also be reelected.\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nThis Story Filed Under","token_len":339,"entropy":[5.2218,3.896,1.3458,7.4535,9.3859,6.9556,3.3045,5.0971,12.169,2.1425,0.8538,0.4017,6.0897,2.1042,5.1516,0.1702,0.9029,6.3688,0.223,4.9364,0.1093,1.5512,1.473,2.6544,0.3849,0.0022,3.4447,5.6555,7.8996,1.0223,4.8133,4.2356,4.9214,4.6727,7.051,5.6583,3.0086,1.5994,5.1523,2.2754,3.6987,5.3762,4.059,1.3759,0.5563,6.1474,5.1575,4.7836,1.1953,4.68,1.193,2.74,0.1636,0.671,3.0172,0.0005,2.4925,2.801,5.8895,0.3824,2.1014,3.7748,0.1839,3.6112,0.3211,4.4339,3.4139,3.9743,0.5977,4.4379,3.5394,1.5462,3.5061,4.3322,0.2169,1.3255,1.4024,1.4615,2.2624,3.6064,2.5579,0.9215,3.7373,2.5876,2.2149,5.6072,2.2073,2.66,3.5543,2.6327,1.1125,0.9493,0.0005,2.4818,3.5094,0.9462,3.1705,0.1588,2.1217,4.9134,5.1923,1.5503,4.7442,1.0975,4.7708,1.7514,3.6994,1.7761,3.6556,3.8331,3.9734,2.0119,3.0247,1.1733,0.2944,1.2342,0.5948,1.4601,3.0829,5.1826,3.6422,3.5454,1.3454,4.7206,1.2671,1.4133,0.5884,4.2168,5.7341,4.6946,4.2854,1.1403,4.4808,0.2982,2.6045,4.9281,5.8048,0.016,5.3201,3.3509,1.7976,4.0732,2.0191,0.7742,2.63,0.5017,0.0025,5.231,1.8028,5.5553,2.1708,3.75,2.3178,1.7527,5.487,2.8506,0.9948,5.692,0.667,0.5992,0.557,0.0002,1.8151,3.3212,3.6835,4.9282,5.1913,2.607,0.5991,5.5223,0.8439,3.2175,5.2304,4.9093,1.8724,1.6421,3.308,4.9937,1.2288,1.1198,2.9602,3.0266,3.7484,5.3376,3.8774,3.1037,1.6367,2.6175,3.1321,1.1528,4.0323,2.3994,4.7713,2.9238,2.8289,3.2436,3.8571,1.8738,0.8777,2.2153,0.5051,0.354,2.1531,0.9326,5.4363,2.3101,0.8677,2.3386,0.8715,4.2122,1.137,4.4588,0.5659,4.804,4.4599,5.3436,0.4478,1.153,2.4877,0.1751,0.0027,1.8922,3.7997,4.0246,1.5496,1.6071,2.0329,0.0887,1.1943,4.7754,3.9478,0.8033,5.7291,4.0281,1.0242,0.0878,0.9172,5.3187,4.0315,1.2279,0.0018,4.5888,2.8761,3.7527,0.3255,0.3479,0.0002,4.6593,1.4169,2.1243,0.1194,0.8325,1.0081,0.0012,4.9132,0.602,3.8011,3.0046,3.0435,5.3348,6.5813,0.063,3.314,0.903,4.4617,3.2061,1.1754,4.046,4.2106,3.5947,4.4009,0.0022,5.0726,5.5375,0.4573,2.3112,0.6328,0.0039,6.1941,4.2902,1.5906,1.713,4.0371,0.391,2.303,2.0325,1.3235,5.1612,0.7842,4.4521,3.4015,0.5756,2.2854,3.2593,5.7703,1.332,0.3292,0.3924,0.8274,0.8738,0.0017,4.715,0.0521,0.0787,3.0149,3.391,5.9256,0.4655,3.2464,0.0149,1.6662,0.2784,1.4835,1.4559,3.4781,2.398,3.2582,1.935,4.1903,1.4467,4.0441,2.0621,1.1753,0.4817,0.0002,3.972,1.8103,1.2572,0.0347,0.0454,1.5652,1.1912,0.0002,3.3745,1.9148,0.0004,0.0001,0.0007]}

Club, John Reid holds Rachel responsible for the success of your 'N' Up Comedy Tour. Rachel's work on the show has been instrumental in helping make 'N' up for the last decade and she has provided great commentary to the show's creative team as well as the show's main cast.\nWith this season being split up between shows and projects, the creative team is looking to bring a strong and original comedic element together to offer a greater insight into what is happening in your comedy scene. As we enter season 10 with a strong set of writers and artists including John Reid, Amy Adams, and others, we are looking to see how this season will play out. Can Rachel or Rachels make a statement to the rest of comedy while also moving away from the traditional comedic aspects with more authentic comedy elements like acting and writing? How could you possibly help the producers?\nIn closing, we believe that this season will have the potential to live up to its name and that you won't have time to let yourself down.

The river would go through Missouri in the 19th century and ultimately into the Union at the Illinois' east end, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers.\n\nAn interesting finding about the river: as of today, there are hundreds of river crossings over Missouri and parts of Minnesota before it crosses and is cut to meet a state-defined route that runs along Lake Okeechobee and into Oregon, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The Missouri River Valley River has been identified more than 200 times, but the one that ran between Okeechobee and Oregon would be one the few places in the nation where this river crossed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere's the big takeaway from our research: There is plenty of water across the country that people use to cook and drink and the state has much more water left to cover its water needs. And we now know that water use, whether it's the use of water pump stations or more water storage facilities in the state, is on the rise. As of 2013, Americans own about one-fourth of American freshwater, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior, and the state's freshwater supply, which is currently controlled by the National Aquifer Society, is expected to increase further by 15 percent by the year 2030. With water used to cook and drink in the state at over a third of the country's water requirements as of this week, the state can almost double its freshwater level by 2030, due in large part to population growth.\n\nMore from The Daily Caller:","token_len":349,"entropy":[9.4611,10.4254,8.4304,1.4005,5.8,2.882,2.5334,1.0607,2.6608,0.0018,0.2055,1.1072,7.0436,9.8088,0.7585,5.6522,1.095,1.1375,2.6713,2.5333,7.7392,2.4307,5.2602,9.1752,0.7904,2.8858,1.1008,4.7563,0.284,0.6071,3.4996,4.6468,1.8189,0.2625,2.1033,1.8677,4.9141,4.7639,1.3767,4.0559,2.5548,1.6877,2.9794,0.0167,0.1091,1.7483,5.4935,1.7733,1.6409,5.3575,3.5129,0.5807,6.0607,4.8521,5.1582,1.209,1.3152,4.8682,0.0006,1.6905,3.511,3.9133,0.5181,0.1167,0.003,0.5284,0.6349,0.0004,5.161,4.7774,5.5073,2.1422,0.5778,1.3835,3.8894,5.8277,3.0629,3.7299,0.0841,2.7391,0.6108,6.1932,0.0446,4.2461,0.7266,4.1523,3.079,2.3891,3.748,0.0023,4.3444,7.4568,1.4479,1.5742,6.5851,3.6375,4.0499,3.9103,5.1152,2.4091,4.204,1.9677,6.3245,3.4581,2.9192,2.5541,1.967,4.522,2.628,2.178,0.0024,0.0001,0.0,1.8397,3.3451,5.4119,2.1211,1.5842,0.0018,0.8547,1.3873,3.8511,1.5343,0.0039,0.3959,2.2641,3.7099,0.8501,4.5805,5.151,4.3632,1.7135,4.6286,5.6496,0.2113,3.3791,0.0819,1.9033,2.4631,1.8582,5.8245,1.0518,5.1838,3.6843,3.3194,0.0685,0.0077,0.0064,0.0009,0.056,2.5348,5.7947,1.6986,4.1515,4.4031,3.4679,3.341,1.6868,0.3201,2.7827,1.1141,3.939,1.4937,2.2504,2.0622,0.3444,0.0002,4.0503,0.1646,0.0002,5.5123,0.5129,1.7679,5.2515,3.3573,1.0849,4.2525,2.7491,0.3806,4.396,1.4756,4.4979,0.0701,2.5475,4.329,0.4718,3.1423,1.318,5.4046,2.6896,1.2267,5.4501,1.4692,1.7254,2.4545,3.7861,3.9965,2.3692,4.6093,0.8958,2.1489,5.2707,1.6934,5.3579,1.5716,2.4596,0.7102,0.9505,3.5141,3.9978,5.864,0.2082,0.4775,2.694,3.0385,3.9241,3.5613,1.1851,0.4667,3.9081,2.9784,0.0308,2.7789,5.7763,2.2215,1.0285,5.2419,2.7614,4.6286,1.8,3.7938,1.7886,2.0028,0.3829,0.9292,4.2973,0.4761,0.1218,0.7743,4.3812,2.0225,3.2865,0.0607,4.9632,4.2727,1.7797,3.4188,0.4158,2.6716,0.0897,5.9708,3.5063,2.1617,0.7637,0.0007,0.4169,1.6028,0.0006,0.0084,0.0024,0.9118,0.001,1.3481,0.0482,2.6958,1.1526,2.2198,1.9543,1.8223,3.9741,2.517,4.2239,1.4648,1.2908,3.9322,4.8044,0.1157,0.5343,2.9481,3.0392,0.6748,3.1778,0.1852,0.7417,1.4286,0.001,2.2505,4.6528,1.5352,5.0958,0.4897,0.888,2.3554,0.9543,1.5479,0.4444,6.0455,2.9255,3.7118,1.31,1.9983,0.9447,0.4768,2.9076,0.7286,0.5637,3.5022,5.2962,3.4403,0.7304,0.3421,0.8248,3.4546,0.0805,2.461,4.8807,6.0751,0.3522,3.4657,4.3965,0.0629,1.8247,0.9613,3.4643,5.4661,1.9035,0.5036,2.4943,5.5537,0.5083,1.5334,1.1757,6.4386,1.4646,0.8899,0.0028,0.006,5.5482,0.182,0.9055,0.3661,0.0002,5.2719,1.7496,2.3526,1.8191,0.3696,0.1643]}

The monument, which was to be a statue of a man representing the descamisados, was projected onto the concrete floor in front of the monument by the construction company. The workers refused to allow people to see them as it did not allow attention to the site, and the work was cut short as part of the building's redevelopment.\n\n\"The memorial was taken [by the group] and removed,\" wrote a man who was present on the site, who requested anonymity to offer his opinion. \"When we arrived at the site, the workers stopped us. On the other side of the wall, the members of the group moved on. Some came out to talk to our children, and the rest of us took our place.\"\n\nWhen asked what was the reason for removing the memorial, Evita confessed her love for this project, and told us she wanted to make the work as fun and beautiful as possible.\n\n\"We believe that this work will also help us to live a healthy lifestyle,\" said the woman, who also requested anonymity. \"It will help me understand what this is all about. I feel that I will be happier knowing what I have done for a living.\"\n\nEvita says she started the project to give her children some peace of mind which will hopefully help them with the process of building their own memorial statue.

{"id":4641,"ended":false,"length":320,"gen_text":"The thirteenth tropical depression developed 275 mi ( 443 km ) southwest of Bermuda on September 22, and was initially expected to intensify into a tropical storm. Although it failed to further intensify, the three tropical cyclones were capable of causing significant droughts of about 15 to 20mm in height. In the aftermath of the thirteenth tropical depression, the Bahamas became a major focal point of Tropical Storm Irene with storm surge exceeding 10mm due to strong winds. During the rainy season of October to early November, the tropical storm was mainly responsible for weakening air currents that pushed it closer to the United States. In response, Irene was accompanied with two major hurricanes: one in April that swept ashore the Bahamas and on 9 October killed more than 2,000 with winds of up to 55 mph, followed by a larger destructive Category 5 hurricane on October 30 that tore away a population of 25,000. It remained in the hurricane list after a massive Hurricane Katrina in 2004, and later led to what will be considered part of Irene's record as the most destructive storm to hit the Caribbean since Katrina.\n\nAs a global storm surge accumulates globally in the next few months, the storm surge from Hurricane Katrina and Maria, like that produced by the thirteenth tropical depression, can be blamed on factors other than the tropical cyclones. When the Atlantic hurricane season rolls over in November, the thirteenth tropical depression is expected to be expected to increase in intensity until the end of December.\n\nRelated article: The Seven Seas: The Most Dangerous Monsters In The World\n\nRelated Article: New Hurricane Is Made of Strong, Strong and Stronger Parts That Can Drive Storm Surge\n\nAbout\n\nMore content from Motherboard and Beyond the Horizon:","token_len":354,"entropy":[9.5605,1.816,0.0005,11.18,4.1679,6.8634,12.8239,7.3555,2.2009,14.2303,0.1146,2.8542,3.7236,0.1496,5.9406,2.9903,3.1474,3.4003,0.2589,5.4033,2.473,5.8031,3.7602,0.0317,5.1929,2.7175,0.9518,1.5691,1.888,2.3101,4.2709,2.1779,5.2682,0.192,7.8267,1.6034,0.9504,1.1735,5.7652,2.0537,1.2889,0.0444,2.2819,4.4426,0.019,3.0433,2.3749,5.3549,0.0157,0.0009,3.6277,3.2471,4.0791,1.7117,0.9143,6.5652,1.9566,2.5094,1.0909,3.0821,1.66,4.8072,0.1947,0.5979,3.3515,0.0918,0.0001,0.4049,0.0513,0.2077,1.3348,4.8194,2.5593,1.4666,2.0044,5.2594,0.0562,1.1252,4.9743,0.1336,2.6057,0.0021,4.4915,5.1573,1.3339,3.2203,2.999,2.735,6.6117,0.062,3.7773,0.5441,1.4666,4.221,0.6568,4.311,0.0602,2.1364,3.1337,3.3419,4.3429,0.1314,0.3255,1.3362,2.8686,1.3814,2.8893,5.279,2.1345,0.0073,3.7794,6.3936,1.4177,2.606,4.3634,4.2792,4.7074,0.1088,0.4339,4.794,0.0223,0.7923,2.5251,4.4223,0.5465,4.4664,0.0006,2.4737,4.3959,5.1243,4.5714,2.7766,0.9471,2.2396,3.9055,2.4942,4.064,3.5593,3.8067,2.6214,2.4293,1.5355,0.8932,5.4484,6.2998,1.4324,3.9165,2.0025,0.0071,3.1121,0.0356,0.6344,7.8218,1.0809,0.6261,1.9438,0.0114,4.3833,1.6403,2.5879,3.5899,0.0793,1.1367,5.6668,5.2703,3.9452,1.1088,0.6404,1.4153,4.278,3.5834,1.0688,4.972,3.7246,3.3696,5.3658,0.3005,5.1556,0.2162,0.0325,1.0342,4.5816,4.5413,2.2016,0.6453,4.0625,5.9334,4.1369,3.2546,5.702,6.0358,2.293,1.7621,3.6799,1.4567,1.6609,4.2821,5.7978,0.3881,6.2775,5.6637,0.5522,3.0573,6.8031,0.0973,3.4841,0.0005,0.3816,3.7472,1.4522,1.2357,2.0091,0.5191,2.8404,1.3961,0.4988,0.2285,3.3349,1.4157,2.1939,0.6785,1.4378,0.0356,4.8418,2.1939,5.3792,3.62,3.1396,3.6428,0.0017,6.0325,3.8431,0.8644,3.4243,1.1251,1.9695,0.1408,1.4192,3.7445,0.7013,4.0702,3.2339,2.9038,2.7081,4.8369,3.2349,5.9047,2.3268,4.1465,0.1604,1.3827,2.9142,0.0203,0.0001,0.1037,0.1586,0.1765,2.8622,1.7835,4.2013,0.5855,3.8233,1.5516,0.0015,1.3949,2.8302,0.4535,0.4092,0.814,5.5616,1.485,4.4695,1.3424,1.4853,4.529,2.781,1.3855,2.4847,0.2665,1.2547,3.3848,0.0184,0.0003,0.1143,0.106,2.4159,0.376,0.0023,2.7486,4.0167,0.0207,3.9746,1.3822,0.6815,3.6484,1.5578,1.2671,0.0071,1.8768,0.7024,2.5371,0.0004,5.0662,3.9756,0.7299,2.6214,5.4203,3.724,2.1844,1.9023,4.3427,1.5765,5.8872,2.5073,0.5611,0.4531,0.8137,0.0003,2.8201,3.6928,0.0077,5.6297,3.6937,4.1971,5.3328,2.3665,5.2669,2.5428,2.4747,4.6662,1.8622,0.6942,5.5279,3.9389,2.2828,4.9209,3.0941,1.0635,0.4784,0.0003,5.4822,3.2526,0.0002,5.7055,4.1633,0.8167,5.6625,0.0295,4.1835,4.1472,5.0465,5.4981,1.0886]}
{"id":2910,"ended":false,"length":314,"gen_text":"Caras Park is located just south of the historic Wilma Theatre downtown. It is located on land reclaimed when the Higgins Avenue Bridge was widened from two lanes to four in 1962. Before the construction of the new ballpark began, the park was on the site of the Biltmore Theatre. In 1970, the Wilma Theater was moved to the new Wilma Theatre Building. All new facilities are now located on land owned by the Wilma Trust. This facility was closed after the 2003 hurricane season during Hurricane Harvey. The stadium and ground floor now have retail stores, a museum and a second floor retail floor for new equipment, services & merchandise. This new structure has been designed using high quality materials including 3D printing and resin. The new stadium is located over a 700-seat stadium, complete with an outdoor amphitheater. This development also includes the former Wilma Theater Building, located in the former Wilma Center.\n\nThis new Wilma stadium opened in 2004, and the new Wilma Theater building is part of the new Wilma Civic Centre. The new Wilma Civic Centre is located at the former McCrae Sports Center, adjacent to the old Wilma Theatre. A new commercial space for Wilma Theatre construction is now being built adjacent to the old Wilma Theatre. The renovated site includes retail areas, a sports plaza, and a second floor commercial space (with an indoor and outdoor pool)\n\nThe Wilma Theatre is planned to open in 2019, and the Wilma Civic Centre will be expanded to accommodate a theater and auditorium. The new Wilma Center will also be built on a site of formerly unused facilities like the Wilma Civic Centre and the Civic Centre Grounds.\n\nMore info: www.spirepark.com","token_len":354,"entropy":[6.6645,8.6873,3.3348,3.0468,2.6233,2.3639,0.0054,1.4571,5.5078,7.4581,3.8514,6.8674,6.332,0.5769,2.3399,1.4162,2.7064,1.6777,7.5451,5.0048,6.9858,0.6928,10.6183,5.2703,1.5312,0.47,5.5891,4.7427,5.5189,0.5768,0.5977,1.7903,2.3977,4.0469,0.3741,7.1808,1.0448,3.3346,0.18,0.2338,3.0223,5.1585,4.5834,0.6583,1.0344,2.0328,0.6412,4.3762,0.8475,1.8785,0.0605,1.146,5.8611,3.502,0.0005,2.9328,1.3591,3.1947,4.6293,0.1947,0.713,4.0448,0.0707,2.7793,0.8482,3.315,0.3519,0.9937,3.2936,1.9134,0.0527,2.0474,4.5532,1.1074,6.2551,3.394,4.1574,1.7007,1.4633,1.1993,1.3828,3.2976,1.5952,0.0795,0.4949,2.6574,0.0351,4.8187,0.6852,4.0881,4.0982,2.0489,3.8897,4.2612,1.1012,5.3754,4.4423,3.788,5.5369,2.6049,2.6708,0.6698,1.7771,5.0789,3.5021,5.5687,0.8539,4.965,2.7174,6.2306,3.5015,1.1985,2.0969,4.9388,1.0943,1.1186,5.1795,1.5231,2.6736,6.0033,3.2737,5.3194,3.1555,2.6021,4.9141,5.9138,2.0503,0.1721,3.9259,1.7793,4.5857,2.5431,1.6854,2.1867,4.59,4.4314,1.2931,0.6739,2.6721,5.1967,0.3599,1.1929,1.4044,5.0049,1.1069,1.2189,1.1817,1.5031,1.7011,2.2866,5.4957,1.8321,5.4176,1.4835,3.7408,2.3877,3.0245,3.9672,0.0133,3.1627,2.6888,3.6281,0.0009,0.0474,1.8034,3.0023,5.665,3.6452,0.888,2.0857,4.1756,2.4233,0.0487,2.0907,3.1803,1.6266,4.1153,2.0901,0.6195,2.2227,2.084,0.0417,3.9581,1.308,1.754,0.0016,4.0425,1.9895,2.8073,0.0101,3.2425,5.3237,0.5074,3.9212,2.3595,1.3714,2.5759,1.7422,1.1462,0.0095,2.4857,2.4643,0.9954,4.9726,0.0033,0.5281,1.6759,0.4011,0.0109,5.7132,4.0509,0.647,0.9705,0.9628,0.6843,0.0094,1.4382,0.0278,1.0408,1.0593,2.243,1.2179,2.0977,6.3208,4.8211,0.0748,4.3798,1.2329,1.8047,3.7818,0.0121,0.2587,2.4454,1.4781,0.0127,1.888,0.9212,4.4787,1.0315,5.3042,2.602,4.3034,3.0457,0.0311,3.8161,5.2778,0.9595,3.0251,1.9331,0.9039,2.7567,0.0431,0.1655,2.0467,0.8125,0.0081,1.0438,1.1355,1.0397,5.648,6.18,2.1092,4.4624,4.974,0.5905,0.9684,4.7655,5.694,0.4487,2.1166,0.9014,3.4415,0.1938,3.6887,0.7605,5.4304,3.1819,2.7733,1.6912,1.6395,0.1747,3.7234,2.2812,3.4491,0.0002,1.21,1.391,0.0141,1.6148,1.4409,6.4987,0.6296,1.3285,0.4912,2.276,2.0725,0.8281,1.2874,1.9633,0.0095,2.5235,0.0341,1.018,0.9829,4.9465,0.5606,1.9627,2.5184,5.6534,1.9817,5.2256,0.001,0.6459,1.0112,1.3934,0.4557,0.0108,3.4835,0.5958,2.0792,1.5778,2.9447,1.7602,2.4115,2.8699,3.6922,6.695,3.6481,5.4876,4.9861,0.2977,2.2207,0.0265,4.4777,0.5834,1.4845,0.874,5.5389,1.187,4.8368,0.4426,1.0829,0.0002,5.0804,3.0349,1.231,3.0921,0.0012,4.6753,4.7528,2.828,0.3794,0.3119]}

He died in the same location in February 2005.\nWhen asked about the inspiration behind this short film, he said, \"...I would like to thank God that we're all doing something together.\"\n[More info at\u00a0 http:\/\/www.thechrismat.com","token_len":358,"entropy":[11.1962,13.5405,2.0815,5.3364,5.9334,2.3501,4.7075,0.9309,11.755,5.5947,2.0297,2.1494,6.1659,4.1823,2.2857,4.5502,2.5315,6.0248,11.5451,2.9924,6.1825,9.5484,11.6444,2.7949,0.144,4.4999,4.0649,4.2724,1.5087,1.1385,3.2843,8.1511,3.3075,0.7028,2.1192,0.7162,3.5838,1.4371,3.1786,2.4048,0.6464,1.9365,4.9146,2.1218,4.4684,2.5529,1.2942,5.9034,0.3793,0.9445,4.9997,5.9822,3.7257,4.9504,1.203,1.9169,2.4579,2.8772,1.6915,4.1212,5.075,2.0413,4.5753,0.6626,2.5466,6.351,5.6597,3.7701,5.5837,4.8259,3.7218,5.3267,4.4535,2.3591,2.505,5.2284,0.0165,4.8457,0.516,0.001,4.7948,3.3139,4.4301,2.0812,0.0003,0.0236,0.3899,0.8843,3.7222,2.2321,0.5978,2.4107,7.8661,2.8297,2.364,0.0192,0.3839,2.6363,5.3906,4.4774,0.8046,1.0787,4.3366,1.2536,7.0968,0.1282,5.6481,1.4932,1.182,2.0954,3.5849,1.206,3.7254,0.0093,2.3389,0.8994,5.2561,5.3292,3.4504,4.5439,5.3027,1.2808,5.6521,1.4917,2.176,0.6409,3.6375,3.1414,5.6581,1.6884,5.1467,4.4987,1.3308,1.1969,1.8999,4.4339,5.145,0.0181,1.5437,5.33,2.2131,3.9919,5.5575,2.8759,4.2335,4.4596,6.3721,1.2134,0.7951,1.7606,4.7169,1.2079,1.8378,3.169,1.3344,2.6136,1.98,4.3146,2.7227,0.3399,4.3729,0.361,0.8766,4.4629,3.7993,3.1494,5.337,0.8566,0.0015,2.0299,3.0292,5.6182,0.5823,1.0978,3.3003,2.9981,2.6232,5.9317,0.138,2.7897,2.8306,1.0653,0.6144,3.1166,5.0381,1.8835,2.2565,4.8809,2.3826,4.3863,3.7365,2.8224,4.6538,5.0464,4.1393,5.4824,2.8102,4.908,2.6024,0.6148,1.9966,4.6769,3.4927,2.4202,2.1865,1.0402,4.423,2.2284,1.915,4.0499,3.7844,4.1321,0.145,5.26,1.3247,3.3202,1.0161,0.6384,1.4813,1.9477,0.152,0.2534,0.0065,0.1017,0.8087,3.2024,3.8658,2.531,1.173,0.6381,3.0516,1.4832,3.9593,0.8916,4.6365,2.2564,2.6101,5.6612,0.5948,4.4054,1.6876,3.3355,1.3189,5.3342,2.7125,5.285,1.8667,2.9687,4.6874,1.2606,0.0338,3.5392,3.1322,0.7241,2.9464,4.2226,5.9922,1.2049,2.3464,4.0916,0.7501,4.1211,3.9955,1.2307,6.0507,2.0166,2.8113,3.0284,1.025,3.934,0.4473,3.1353,4.4692,2.2842,4.5044,5.2352,2.3127,1.036,4.0237,0.0524,0.4811,0.9011,5.3494,0.3019,2.8116,2.0915,0.6272,0.1162,4.3258,5.5781,0.171,1.4583,1.9446,5.4456,0.2142,1.7304,5.1465,4.297,1.5724,4.5668,0.9854,1.3603,2.8601,0.718,3.9213,4.5939,4.7703,1.1389,4.0859,3.7446,0.6372,0.7753,5.2853,2.3383,1.144,1.8673,5.6533,0.8365,3.7649,3.1855,0.4174,0.3625,1.9733,0.6024,0.637,4.4176,2.7018,4.4321,1.8595,0.095,2.0656,4.56,1.4894,2.507,3.4185,2.5839,3.7615,2.4359,2.3004,2.2501,1.2701,5.4372,5.6648,3.2542,3.1829,2.9502,1.1657,0.0038,0.728,0.0007,3.8108,5.5277,4.4607,0.3939,3.5469,1.625,0.2859]}
{"id":1438,"ended":false,"length":341,"gen_text":"In Alabama's first @ - @ ever trip to Duke, the Crimson Tide defeated the Blue Devils by a final score of 62 \u2013 13 in front of the largest crowd at Wallace's Stadium since the game in 2009. The game was featured in the national championship game between Alabama and Clemson with the Tide winning 57-17 and Clemson getting the upset. The game was replayed a couple of times but there is nothing that tells us anything about the history of the game after that game. The only mention is that the game was on Sept. 27 at 3 p.m. ET.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, we're happy with what has happened with this particular event. This is the first Alabama trip to Duke and has only been done once with a 4-0 score. If you want more information on Alabama's trip to Duke, head over to this report posted in the Alabama State League Player's Hall of Fame, which included that post.\n\nAlabama and Clemson are the two most consistent ACC teams to go undefeated in their 10 seasons under Charles Woodrow, so while they are the only ACC team in history to lose both of their losing seasons in their final 13 games, this game shouldn't set a precedent that won't ever be repeated.\n\nThe most ridiculous thing about this game is that Auburn came out victorious in the second half which will set a great precedent for college football in other areas as well. At the very least, the game should provide an interesting history lesson for the next couple of years at Auburn. At this point, it seems the game will also provide important historical context for the future of this school and will only become more relevant as the season continues.\n\nMore from The Big Lead:\n\n[Featured Image by Jeff Chew, Getty Images]","token_len":361,"entropy":[10.0581,2.6409,5.034,10.8401,10.6642,5.3959,11.8896,7.7166,0.4745,8.6614,2.2793,2.7797,3.8815,0.0098,3.5877,1.563,3.6646,0.0381,4.0501,1.0651,5.2226,0.1747,0.0233,5.3411,7.2848,5.771,2.2893,3.79,0.0021,3.3996,6.9968,0.3668,2.3848,9.4954,2.1408,2.4351,2.8024,1.571,3.8943,1.8513,4.1675,0.356,1.988,2.2891,1.174,5.5832,1.4431,1.1531,3.7635,3.0621,1.3686,2.113,1.6564,0.0801,2.1787,5.2334,1.2402,1.9248,1.7483,5.1581,0.3229,3.8262,2.4428,0.8849,5.0936,2.3515,2.837,1.2233,1.9028,1.4054,1.0097,5.5403,0.1463,4.8057,2.3977,0.7034,0.0955,4.7547,4.0082,2.2088,2.8015,3.3121,4.4768,1.5576,2.4518,0.4163,0.7873,5.1007,0.3417,0.7512,0.4072,6.0246,1.6374,2.3325,0.3732,2.2957,2.8017,2.8207,3.4149,1.2087,1.3342,1.7867,0.5871,4.7948,5.006,0.1349,3.5508,3.3412,4.9606,0.9019,0.0005,0.0002,0.1909,3.2585,0.9433,3.6446,0.0005,5.3201,1.2115,1.8402,0.0288,0.3858,1.5966,0.3184,2.8049,3.0798,4.2089,2.14,2.2456,4.7613,1.1086,2.9638,1.7393,4.61,3.4858,0.5312,3.6206,0.9921,2.0605,1.2012,4.6315,3.4323,0.4816,1.3328,2.1049,4.364,4.6796,0.8849,3.3605,1.3664,5.3854,2.2615,5.6339,0.3944,0.909,5.0503,1.4379,4.154,1.5482,2.6214,3.1599,0.9804,0.9541,2.887,0.7739,1.4255,0.4977,0.4753,0.6165,3.1648,0.6921,0.0448,2.3933,5.8432,5.218,3.2957,1.0681,1.8711,3.8521,5.6395,5.3894,0.7897,4.0016,0.3473,0.0028,3.6055,2.0226,5.9056,5.045,4.9944,1.1911,1.7873,0.0003,2.2665,4.575,0.5087,2.9274,2.1759,1.9387,2.2113,4.5572,4.4548,0.3676,4.0091,3.9796,0.8459,0.9654,2.5527,5.1961,1.132,4.1543,6.0605,1.7733,2.6172,3.0668,4.1977,4.9688,2.6298,1.9589,2.7921,1.1858,2.4994,0.7161,3.5209,1.4619,0.2597,2.8235,4.2858,1.8807,0.5796,5.6605,0.1766,2.6555,3.9756,3.4822,4.6236,0.9116,0.5161,2.5821,3.2812,5.9859,0.0002,6.2974,2.0107,0.8849,2.4674,4.6465,0.0024,3.5571,1.9469,0.3705,0.4742,1.6605,0.0002,2.6007,4.3835,6.2386,1.2409,0.6238,0.3675,1.0849,0.5747,0.628,5.3799,4.619,0.9712,3.3633,1.7815,0.9373,2.7467,0.3504,6.335,4.0595,4.0011,1.541,6.5062,0.3161,0.4194,5.2246,0.2409,1.5733,4.7109,3.9785,2.515,0.674,0.1729,5.2066,1.3527,1.9032,0.0629,0.2481,2.2237,2.2087,1.4176,5.1854,2.2917,2.7497,4.6104,0.0664,0.8592,1.8947,2.9067,4.0296,0.3303,0.3742,4.8806,2.6522,0.5054,5.7948,1.5283,0.1652,0.6322,1.9452,2.952,3.5165,3.6708,1.7095,4.6862,2.4855,5.2373,2.285,0.7947,0.6414,1.3689,2.3166,0.8053,3.5249,3.1693,2.1408,3.9648,4.9963,3.292,0.3733,1.2558,0.7068,1.1437,1.4181,2.8167,0.2256,0.6173,0.0002,4.9304,1.9112,2.0433,4.517,0.2046,0.574,0.7572,0.0003,5.3877,4.6719,0.1023,0.624,4.043,5.412,0.618,3.3705,2.9532,0.0285,0.1316]}

( http:\/\/storify.com\/2013\/08\/01\/jealousy has become a form of aggression \/ bullying).\n\nThis wasn't her first offense, though -- in 2000 she said of herself before she left that she was \"too old for college\" and that she might have to start over at a local college. She also claimed that she liked to have children :\n\nOf course, all of this was true. After all, one would think that for any celebrity to feel that way would be one of the things that led to her being called by many people who considered her more important than anyone in the group. And her latest behavior certainly reflects her own personality, which she says is rooted in being older and working fewer hours.\n\nI can't argue that her behavior and the actions she appears to have made while on the outside world are a sign that she is feeling down in the dumps or that she needs help. As for some of the other tweets that she's sent out in recent months (including this one from 2004 where she asked for help), the fact that her comments were so \"outright racist,\" and now that she's been banned from twitter doesn't seem to make the situation any less obvious. I found those tweets fascinating.\n\nBut it makes perfect sense to put her at the center of any #MeToo movement. Or at least it should for me, because if she is doing something wrong, we should make it clear, and if she has gone overboard, we should point blame in the other direction.","token_len":362,"entropy":[2.412,3.9211,7.6371,2.683,2.0531,0.7855,5.9839,0.3902,5.0719,16.1709,8.5479,2.6694,6.3179,3.0541,4.3599,2.0752,3.1978,4.5426,3.3079,0.3253,4.9628,7.9068,7.5223,2.11,10.2814,11.562,0.3578,4.9406,2.8509,3.8199,1.4233,1.3862,1.2212,0.3704,4.5178,2.1058,1.8895,1.6099,3.083,4.3604,3.794,0.0381,6.8769,6.6914,3.2866,7.1381,4.9823,6.3314,0.0005,5.7128,1.9993,0.0255,0.0017,0.8608,0.0128,3.9834,0.0214,2.2858,0.0025,3.372,0.0025,4.8743,5.4537,0.4311,8.02,2.5146,1.1466,5.6189,0.0618,5.922,3.3442,3.4453,4.5913,2.0455,0.0292,4.2406,5.2266,0.0007,3.3411,0.6484,5.9072,1.5558,2.1142,4.6268,2.1204,5.0106,2.5936,4.1641,4.0054,3.8233,6.1323,1.9587,3.0979,2.6455,0.7206,1.4191,0.9576,3.9518,3.5195,1.6128,3.7979,1.3538,0.9187,1.829,0.6615,5.511,2.0286,1.9937,3.5995,1.75,2.5837,1.3029,3.4545,1.503,0.824,2.1562,2.0285,3.7589,0.8212,0.7097,5.7425,1.7077,3.7923,3.8919,6.5081,1.2509,0.0003,6.0295,0.1415,0.4094,4.7942,0.8867,0.4713,1.56,4.0848,1.7371,3.9932,1.4744,0.0561,5.0543,3.9345,1.0818,0.4752,5.7736,4.141,6.0053,1.3354,5.5444,2.2163,1.1565,1.7893,0.7153,4.7808,0.6645,0.3451,4.1112,0.8548,5.0604,0.5177,1.0851,2.4564,2.8447,3.9535,2.4245,1.9264,3.4856,4.6685,0.5129,5.5921,3.425,0.1715,2.9597,3.4829,0.7884,5.3188,0.4871,2.8834,4.7708,5.6553,4.5529,4.0692,5.6581,3.4309,2.5774,3.9425,1.9635,1.5459,2.8257,3.5633,1.4084,5.2294,0.0854,3.4024,4.4669,1.6624,5.5142,5.1589,0.0245,1.1805,1.0036,0.0004,3.661,3.3872,0.5806,5.5701,1.6723,2.5638,2.2153,4.0072,2.7757,4.5077,0.8093,5.3481,0.0325,0.5074,5.4245,4.427,2.2315,0.816,4.8189,5.2941,1.4324,3.4275,3.3721,1.1513,0.3637,1.1497,5.4391,4.4924,4.4951,0.4275,0.2277,3.2839,1.4683,0.285,3.9265,2.143,0.7976,4.4076,2.4358,5.7191,0.422,0.5416,1.4353,4.6803,1.9978,1.5606,1.9848,3.4329,1.5777,3.3655,1.3334,1.803,3.0882,2.5081,2.3056,0.1412,2.2803,5.5626,4.8068,0.0706,4.908,1.8003,1.5701,4.5211,2.9977,3.7799,0.648,3.1052,4.107,1.7367,2.3798,4.7562,3.408,3.5378,2.9364,3.3789,1.9552,6.1017,1.4941,0.5355,0.6118,2.1936,3.0502,0.543,3.024,4.8411,0.0002,2.0763,0.5207,2.5497,3.3717,2.7444,0.1085,0.7396,4.5363,0.3088,3.6551,6.0215,4.6825,0.7173,4.3897,2.0832,0.7089,0.0003,2.6401,2.8343,4.9347,3.5556,0.005,1.7699,5.4419,1.9134,3.43,1.2065,0.5425,0.0256,4.4602,5.4523,2.36,0.0026,1.0272,1.096,5.6641,0.8054,0.046,3.1051,2.2686,4.7699,2.4884,1.9039,1.2848,3.0948,1.56,2.8264,4.2781,1.974,1.3785,0.6359,3.8957,1.3949,4.485,1.7754,1.2978,3.9503,1.2504,3.4608,0.5455,3.5107,6.1443,3.2228,1.0397,1.1185,0.3449,5.2791,7.431,3.9182,0.2712,3.1854,0.0018,0.2373]}

Clemson had been playing great football and is currently in a losing streak in the conference finals. Clemson has struggled this season at times and it could start to happen again for this season after being one of the biggest winners of the SEC season.\n\nA better chance for Clemson to get back on track is to go to Clemson with 4:01 of overtime against Florida State or 3:48 of overtime against the Orange.\n\nIf the game is held in overtime or when the score is decided, Clemson will be in the conference championship game and is tied for the lead with Stanford, which is in the lead with the Bruins.\n\nIf things go according to plan, it wouldn't make more sense for Clemson to go home with 0:00 on the clock to beat Florida State, Clemson would be in the conference championship game, but there might be a good chance they lose the series instead.\n\nThe final 5 spots will decide who will advance to the College Football Playoff. Clemson wins the first four games. Florida State wins the final three games.\n\nIf things work out for Clemson, it would make more sense for them to get to the finals of the NCAA Tournament. The top five teams in the tournament will advance to the College Football Playoff.\n\nFinal score: 1 \u2013 Florida State 8\n\nFollow me on Twitter @DerekCortez","token_len":362,"entropy":[12.7055,6.2409,1.8912,3.882,4.7295,3.8629,0.4015,2.024,0.5083,7.4418,1.6355,4.4964,0.4815,0.0799,1.2662,1.9123,0.081,1.1376,0.1565,1.0935,14.335,6.981,0.3058,5.2628,3.6176,0.6288,8.4865,6.2369,0.0599,1.5286,4.2767,0.5723,0.8085,1.1959,2.101,2.3259,0.8234,2.1726,2.8454,1.4674,1.291,1.4163,3.8462,1.6223,3.52,4.6063,1.2468,2.5687,5.8925,0.5328,2.9176,4.0162,5.9332,0.5948,2.5298,4.4109,0.3488,7.1654,0.8526,3.9235,0.4829,1.0166,2.6696,5.4584,1.5949,2.79,2.9042,1.8825,1.5001,1.9085,0.7595,3.5711,0.4937,1.1633,0.0039,4.3424,5.0968,4.6251,4.2657,2.7088,2.4289,1.1169,1.5659,0.9474,4.59,0.0275,0.5809,2.349,3.683,2.9719,2.6623,3.9972,1.293,2.8846,4.8826,3.6969,2.069,2.2406,4.2733,0.5713,4.2362,0.4533,4.553,4.9885,0.2195,1.9321,1.9485,4.6294,3.1895,0.3857,4.036,1.2155,2.1414,2.9553,2.3978,4.9334,0.4352,3.0155,0.7153,4.2886,4.1041,2.9219,5.5235,3.9434,4.0722,0.0632,0.053,4.8221,3.9571,0.8394,0.1939,3.9997,4.6012,0.4457,1.2504,0.0003,4.4267,6.0435,4.3366,1.4882,0.1811,0.6047,2.0871,0.3168,0.6494,1.9522,2.111,2.0087,3.5303,2.3908,2.8521,3.021,6.6811,1.5859,5.0257,2.6715,1.8819,4.6598,3.1929,0.3514,5.0077,3.3468,0.0041,4.0173,0.5587,0.0911,0.2271,3.6061,4.3534,0.4659,2.474,0.0003,3.619,2.599,2.4705,1.5403,4.8217,2.1946,2.5134,3.9607,3.5353,1.0467,3.2445,0.1813,4.0482,0.8476,0.6976,0.8731,1.8972,2.3908,1.4793,3.1396,1.7394,0.538,2.5399,4.7329,3.7956,0.9962,1.0003,2.6521,1.9111,4.9546,2.9191,2.6655,0.9673,3.1393,0.4265,3.8404,1.395,2.9285,5.3279,0.2916,1.0475,0.0002,2.8064,6.6425,1.0195,2.6505,0.0011,0.0219,0.5731,4.2688,5.7868,0.0011,5.2377,4.5054,0.0312,0.4513,0.1655,0.0724,1.5712,2.7383,2.1643,5.5778,0.0858,2.2686,4.3065,0.3204,0.0472,1.9076,2.4838,0.707,0.036,2.4304,3.7198,1.3602,1.482,0.8562,0.3306,2.3373,0.484,0.0453,1.7773,3.879,4.4966,4.3502,0.8233,0.9525,4.6135,0.2384,3.3264,2.6142,2.4102,4.2355,5.7625,0.3735,0.6245,0.0002,2.427,4.177,5.6639,5.7251,2.6097,3.7002,1.8329,1.6072,3.1406,0.2075,0.0934,1.7411,0.0307,0.0137,0.8085,2.2873,4.2046,0.3916,3.0229,3.7644,1.7021,2.8477,2.0192,0.0079,0.9748,0.2225,1.7493,1.4915,0.6829,0.386,1.4804,0.0002,2.8326,3.115,4.4779,0.0543,1.3713,0.1286,0.44,1.3608,1.3123,2.4601,1.4098,0.0013,0.428,1.3738,0.0169,2.4938,2.516,0.8178,4.7925,2.4399,0.1315,2.9442,0.9923,1.0144,2.3222,4.1086,2.2841,0.2087,0.766,0.1662,3.0664,1.7782,1.8059,0.202,0.1897,1.3567,0.0042,0.072,0.9478,0.9363,0.0002,4.5003,2.8658,0.7415,3.6579,4.1453,2.1867,0.0452,5.2172,0.9789,0.0002,4.7126,2.4641,0.0998,0.2165,0.875,4.1282,3.4721,3.6139,4.9838,1.6979]}

{"id":1922,"ended":false,"length":334,"gen_text":"One of the first details noted about Iguanodon was that it had the teeth of a herbivorous reptile, although there has not always been consensus on how it ate. As Mantell noted, \"There is one genus in the family Arthropoda, and the other species, Iguanodon, is related to Iguanodon. They seem to be a fairly well-known family of reptiles and humans.\" In 2004, we introduced these fossils to the Museum of America after finding and preserving the remains.\n\nIt is a fairly obvious characteristic of this genus that Iguanodon is very adaptable to new surroundings, such as a tree. On the other hand, Iguanodon is very adaptable to living on top of old trees, but it would be nice to see what new trees may be made to be. We also found large clusters of fossils in a rock that is probably in the forest where the fossil was made, but it would really behoove us to study where these fossils were left, and to see if they are also the remains of live primates, so some of the other animals might also have lived here, or even in this cave. We have to give credit for those small fossils to the authors who produced them, especially for their extensive fossil record.\n\nThese fossils are the first to give us some evidence that this genus lives on the Earth, with only a few hundred species. In fact, their discovery is an important milestone in the study of the planet's history, especially where the researchers had planned to leave out most of these more recent fossils. As the New York Times reports : \"After this work, scientists can now tell us whether dinosaurs were the oldest living creatures on Earth, or just a group of small relatives known as crania.\"","token_len":364,"entropy":[2.8006,0.4101,3.5997,7.4926,7.8631,4.8559,7.6338,6.2746,4.5972,1.5972,1.692,1.2957,0.7885,1.4868,3.3922,6.9614,0.5996,0.7851,8.395,0.0809,2.1904,4.0185,0.018,1.2774,4.2262,3.1399,3.8073,2.1591,7.0955,0.0027,5.5177,1.0373,3.115,2.1193,6.552,1.4257,4.7644,13.7274,3.1439,3.1498,0.4421,1.5547,3.2661,1.1732,4.8672,4.8331,2.9434,1.4262,1.9703,4.4314,2.2438,0.3901,1.2098,1.7341,2.157,2.0909,2.9952,2.4665,3.6313,0.0796,0.019,0.0459,0.7326,1.6604,3.621,0.0989,3.1836,0.1071,0.0351,0.1655,3.3161,3.966,4.8426,0.1054,1.2263,3.5144,3.9197,3.2544,0.3588,0.8603,2.7303,1.367,2.437,2.7409,6.259,1.5994,3.716,5.4052,0.2764,5.1108,5.8166,4.5821,4.0017,0.3184,1.0668,1.6948,0.2874,5.7352,6.235,4.265,5.4943,3.7486,2.3372,1.9152,2.4747,1.3196,0.0043,4.1324,1.2127,3.7595,4.496,3.9341,6.4234,0.6322,2.5399,2.3318,0.8488,2.0601,0.0071,0.0054,0.0062,1.4862,3.5054,5.0666,0.0381,0.818,4.5695,4.7702,1.5299,3.2371,0.0071,3.0608,4.8232,2.2317,5.1497,0.8463,0.5562,0.0136,0.0127,1.6819,0.0017,0.0026,0.0029,1.3874,2.3189,2.3354,0.0315,0.0804,3.8301,2.7025,4.6425,0.0406,4.9743,1.8342,1.189,4.6317,1.9618,4.2755,0.6658,3.3013,0.36,1.5378,3.7444,4.458,2.6512,4.1922,0.9139,3.0222,2.778,2.8586,1.5218,3.1787,2.1093,1.5021,5.2415,5.9075,0.0332,4.5516,1.7223,2.4859,4.0514,2.7524,2.5414,4.5318,4.2199,0.8995,5.0482,4.4429,1.5666,2.9563,0.8135,2.785,1.6912,2.0167,2.1827,2.6081,6.1452,5.21,0.0015,0.0003,0.6928,0.0612,3.9426,3.6374,1.6149,0.8795,1.1992,5.8505,2.8312,1.4234,2.2403,2.3627,0.8002,0.823,2.0551,5.4154,4.7742,1.3448,0.0355,5.7582,5.867,2.5854,4.4059,6.1798,1.05,0.954,4.9164,3.7922,3.3763,2.5162,1.6611,3.4117,3.4878,2.9455,1.9168,3.064,2.5586,3.6735,3.2306,0.3813,2.7453,2.8415,3.4928,4.8429,1.8981,3.5733,5.1679,4.7207,1.8696,0.6256,0.9623,4.9093,2.4353,5.4384,1.1254,0.9316,3.4926,2.992,2.14,5.8719,3.788,0.7831,0.5041,0.5022,0.0001,4.7445,1.57,1.3621,3.6072,1.4706,1.8298,5.7673,0.6041,3.0657,3.9992,1.0119,3.5612,1.9034,4.078,1.4694,2.3512,3.0796,1.4077,4.0735,4.325,1.1784,0.4352,4.7754,2.6584,2.3687,3.408,1.3988,0.0282,5.2352,3.2281,1.7497,3.8842,0.8719,2.4916,0.6023,1.0163,2.5095,0.0188,1.6391,5.588,0.8571,2.5192,1.5142,3.8564,5.4835,2.1473,5.3883,4.5027,5.4636,0.1939,5.1028,1.9945,4.6004,0.4475,3.288,5.1666,1.8621,1.9745,0.3723,3.9967,2.7471,5.1106,0.5941,0.0662,2.6979,6.3076,1.0867,4.8575,5.6807,4.4578,0.4749,2.1913,4.029,1.7385,4.3896,2.6146,2.3721,3.8477,2.0118,3.325,5.5927,0.8667,3.1927,0.6429,0.8397,1.0277,0.9312,2.6779,1.7777,3.6697,0.1258,3.5876,6.1846,4.8711,0.4563,5.4616,0.7115,1.5495]}

He spent the rest of the season at Detroit and he spent part of the time at the Pistons after helping the team prepare for the 2014 NBA Summer League.\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report.","token_len":368,"entropy":[10.6037,2.589,1.7563,4.1026,0.8288,5.223,4.9644,1.3503,0.3643,3.4278,0.9528,0.5339,5.9176,2.4919,2.9376,5.055,2.5704,2.9327,2.0796,0.4416,0.911,1.8172,0.2633,2.2688,1.5246,3.7751,0.6191,0.5265,0.8041,1.0729,3.0774,1.0087,3.3941,4.6058,2.6166,0.4018,1.1231,1.4665,0.0675,3.5434,1.6209,2.4015,1.9128,2.9427,1.3554,4.0083,2.379,0.8837,5.498,2.1743,0.6104,2.0476,3.5363,1.9151,2.4459,2.639,2.2473,0.3355,2.6926,5.8516,6.299,2.061,0.9236,0.2615,3.8947,1.0918,4.2486,1.4232,0.0638,1.1325,1.1347,0.0009,0.7602,2.7386,5.0748,0.5324,2.4015,0.0106,0.0874,2.9463,0.118,5.7712,2.5608,0.8584,4.2007,0.0905,0.0841,6.9964,3.1614,1.9712,2.729,0.0574,2.3216,4.2124,1.4225,3.266,4.5154,7.2861,1.6966,4.5644,0.7917,0.9183,0.9112,0.012,1.005,1.2741,2.9199,5.4755,0.199,0.8859,3.8075,0.5516,0.3082,1.8123,0.2342,2.1389,0.5146,0.0491,0.8253,2.9116,1.9252,2.0997,1.9309,1.9446,2.8984,0.557,4.2009,0.1726,1.0875,2.3843,0.7029,1.098,5.0714,0.3316,2.3835,0.5386,3.1958,0.0553,1.0233,0.8635,0.0002,0.705,4.5144,4.7407,2.4209,0.6993,0.211,0.4419,1.5614,1.016,1.8887,3.6425,2.0805,1.0797,0.7792,2.0206,3.0565,0.056,2.2755,0.02,0.8025,2.4026,0.006,2.2263,0.6473,0.2491,1.5989,0.01,2.4771,0.0529,2.521,1.9093,5.5025,0.0635,0.5093,3.204,0.7045,1.2277,0.0002,3.0054,1.3943,2.9379,0.8377,0.1437,4.6744,5.2688,4.9592,1.7172,3.2665,0.1254,0.0016,0.3575,3.3102,1.7335,4.8296,4.7051,0.3453,1.5367,0.3203,1.1381,3.5182,3.0268,0.0049,1.9692,0.6994,3.8,3.973,4.2517,0.0884,0.3386,2.0636,1.7605,5.1891,1.2788,1.2382,1.7089,0.0203,3.3451,3.3963,0.7426,5.0388,0.0396,2.7947,1.0492,0.7791,3.0541,3.7715,1.0629,0.5302,2.7429,2.9405,0.1715,1.4709,4.2837,2.8501,2.0461,0.0408,0.5034,0.0304,3.2626,0.4009,0.9085,2.7444,1.9362,3.6293,4.519,0.0129,2.4505,0.6733,0.6321,0.0002,0.5747,1.6542,5.7544,1.4578,3.4813,0.1102,1.8321,1.9929,0.0089,0.0647,2.9635,6.0494,2.5226,1.7475,3.7439,2.653,0.1321,0.9497,5.0531,0.9115,0.6059,0.2371,4.7521,0.3291,0.0564,0.2259,0.2857,1.4197,2.8108,3.4761,2.094,2.1312,0.0396,0.4273,2.9435,0.0048,1.7286,0.0613,0.1311,1.9431,0.0007,2.9299,0.0182,4.5444,3.1832,4.7335,1.2237,2.4402,3.3482,0.2307,0.0189,1.7088,0.7237,0.0002,0.6458,3.2377,1.4441,5.9042,6.9332,2.7779,3.4563,5.3335,5.5172,0.44,2.209,3.8451,4.4374,0.8513,5.3308,4.1657,0.2005,0.6626,1.0723,3.3374,1.0952,1.5472,0.0005,0.359,0.5969,2.9257,3.0528,2.5234,5.0678,2.7394,3.7175,0.0041,0.3765,4.2177,2.2528,0.5719,2.5241,4.5503,4.9091,0.7795,0.6411,4.5107,0.1388,0.3859,3.9392,1.6412,2.5494,0.0307,0.3551,0.6659,0.0002,6.212,0.011,0.5786,0.0534,0.0001,0.1288,0.0011,0.0005,0.0012,0.01,0.0124]}
{"id":1833,"ended":true,"length":343,"gen_text":"Johann Elert Bode, in 1772, first suggested that an undiscovered planet could exist between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Kepler had already noticed the gap between Mars and Jupiter in 1596, so it couldn't have been true that planets would merge into the planet at any point because of the planet's orbit around the dwarf planet.\n\n\"We can conclude in our latest paper that there is a possibility that an undiscovered planet could exist between Earth and Mars,\" said Paul Fischlaub, a co-author of the paper and a professor at Brown University. \"We're probably going to have to deal with some supernovae, but with so many extrasolar planets out there that are so close we would need to find something like that to go our long way.\"\n\nScientists know there may be more planets around than we know about, and if they do find them, they will have to work with exoplanets that have a massive moons orbiting the planet, and help them build up their orbit. It's also easier to work with stars with huge atmospheres \u2013 and so some of the closest exoplanets have more hydrogen than gas.\n\nThat said, if a planet's moon had some kind of a life cycle, as it does in some of our solar system's habitable zones, where the planet might even exist, some research has revealed that hydrogen (H 2 O) is important in life. But that hasn't really been confirmed by the astronomers, and researchers had always found that H 2 O could be a life form in outer galaxies due to that star as well. Even after three billion years of studying the Milky Way's environment, it's still difficult to determine the ratio between H 2 O and oxygen in a material the size of Earth.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Space.com.","token_len":372,"entropy":[8.2472,0.7942,11.3537,9.9901,7.8209,4.8922,1.578,5.8143,8.2257,4.4197,0.5903,6.2082,6.2339,1.3894,4.4535,6.9258,1.4353,5.2272,2.665,2.6252,4.8782,1.4585,3.5674,0.0218,3.8836,0.0712,0.4572,0.6689,7.2221,3.6893,2.1596,6.4097,2.1705,7.8095,0.3918,2.9278,0.1372,0.2782,2.4184,5.0148,5.1237,0.771,3.5626,1.8144,5.3577,0.0006,0.7767,0.5495,5.7755,1.8385,3.9592,2.8276,5.5837,1.7478,2.4244,4.3302,3.7959,1.7887,1.5496,6.7709,1.5727,1.0567,3.269,0.1076,2.6159,2.3593,0.7372,6.2695,0.1749,0.2759,1.0353,0.0006,3.2915,2.637,3.2764,4.058,5.0635,3.0268,4.4569,1.5105,0.2132,2.2215,0.7713,1.1465,4.2074,0.6777,3.0426,0.3698,0.0008,0.2526,1.4265,0.679,0.4459,3.3431,0.0866,1.7128,1.0581,1.6668,5.7039,4.7302,4.6254,5.923,1.4538,0.2172,0.8169,3.6584,0.1059,0.0736,0.5927,0.063,0.4361,0.908,0.8047,1.2718,1.2775,5.3183,0.1555,0.7661,0.8911,2.0316,3.7659,5.5099,2.4744,0.0268,1.0161,0.135,4.5758,0.0158,2.8982,6.0594,1.4305,0.1285,2.1172,2.4423,4.9696,4.4069,0.5099,4.6939,0.0017,0.3689,2.4313,0.0139,2.8888,1.9431,2.7002,2.2157,2.6861,3.5165,2.4316,0.616,2.8731,2.7274,2.3455,1.0602,2.3877,4.6481,5.45,4.3367,0.195,0.5203,0.1508,0.0002,4.7956,4.6341,3.155,4.0041,0.1518,2.7755,1.0355,2.8197,3.0778,1.3193,0.8938,1.1261,1.1469,2.0398,3.8041,1.5524,1.1591,2.1357,1.7269,0.4322,0.7242,1.5289,2.0947,0.5194,3.5109,1.8456,5.7846,0.0091,0.2117,1.3715,1.9815,3.2543,4.6151,6.1229,2.4773,2.952,2.4345,1.805,2.4867,5.5526,1.657,5.2052,0.8152,1.3642,2.794,1.8023,4.3668,1.089,2.3309,6.31,0.2998,3.7582,0.1439,4.2724,2.5839,4.2662,2.5426,0.0001,5.6746,3.5377,3.9066,6.2677,1.3031,0.6337,5.166,2.6082,0.0029,0.0379,2.4204,4.2285,5.5007,0.9818,3.2505,1.1591,0.5208,0.0003,4.662,2.4599,0.0099,3.219,3.0542,0.4399,3.367,4.4746,4.1685,4.0423,1.3895,0.0018,4.1538,4.3718,2.3123,0.8383,4.6724,2.7902,1.5801,1.4423,2.8695,1.708,1.6227,1.1978,0.4305,0.1012,3.9988,0.1947,0.1229,6.3488,2.3844,1.8998,3.01,4.9934,2.9307,0.2711,5.156,5.8286,3.6505,5.4747,0.6774,6.4072,6.8552,3.9684,0.373,0.8548,0.4059,2.4749,4.8695,2.4002,1.7504,0.7192,3.4105,3.1433,2.9535,0.0001,2.9486,0.2201,2.5801,2.4414,2.3867,5.5937,1.764,1.5304,4.7469,5.2377,5.6171,3.9342,1.5172,1.8168,0.0169,0.0639,3.6081,1.0841,2.2809,5.3665,1.7996,2.9424,4.8661,5.8827,6.7249,0.007,6.3028,3.9922,6.8714,0.9126,0.8429,5.5873,4.8307,5.5534,1.9589,0.0181,1.0795,3.2244,1.4141,4.6985,0.002,2.3537,5.215,0.2566,2.2517,1.2426,0.8564,2.4334,0.0421,3.675,2.664,5.5783,0.9478,0.5608,0.0109,0.0269,0.0997,3.4834,1.3295,2.9901,4.9786,5.7561,0.0451,0.0643,1.2228,0.5729,0.316,0.0002,3.9396,2.4252,2.0009,0.0593,0.4627,1.6217,0.015,0.0032,0.3056]}

Both actors won excellent notices, but the play, directed by William Brinkley, was withdrawn by the production company. The novel was later adapted in other play forms such as The Lord of the Rings.\n\nAn actor in stage work, a part time director or conductor, an amateur theatre student or a person who had been nominated for a position in the British Royal Opera House in 1926, the actor, producer or conductor was chosen from the selected cast. In the following years many other actors have been selected. On the other hand, more than one-third of the films made on the cast list have since been nominated, with only 4 films nominated for a place on the Royal Opera House.\n\nOlivier Richardson\n\nIn 1931, in collaboration with Thomas Newman, Oscar-Winner in the film The Bourgeois Class, Edward B. White appeared as the late Edward, Jr., an officer in England and the son of a seamstress. He lived with his family in a boarding house in Liverpool, while in London he went to the City Theatre for stage work on stage set, with the latter being the only American actor nominated (in 1920) for a supporting role in the play.

{"id":3392,"ended":true,"length":355,"gen_text":"The Terriers Association was established in 1890 to help retired artists in need of financial help. Leno was an active fundraiser in this and in the Music Hall Benevolent Fund, of which he has donated over $5,000. The funds are generally donated to other causes, like museum openings or concerts. Many have been donated to museums and to the Smithsonian Institution to help their art.\n\nThis piece was done on the 26th June, 1898. This was part of his birthday and is the only work he has done celebrating his birthday. He had this special occasion at the National Museum of Natural History in Philadelphia on 26 June 1898. The work was originally exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery of Philadelphia but he had never performed on a National Portrait Gallery before, with only 4 artists on hand. If you have your own pictures on hand, a large selection shows up in your local community newspaper.\n\nHe has received hundreds of letters, requests and suggestions during the past several years and is very grateful for them. It is impossible not to think of him as a humble man and a man who has taken a tremendous stride in his work. He is not a man of weakness and when he was younger, he wouldn't call a few people up.\n\nWe encourage your members to help us out by supporting the Friends of Leno. His work has been shared by over two million people, many of whom are visiting the Terriers Association. We invite you to visit them once a week for a very limited period and please take a moment to read through his letters and see that the Terriers association has nothing but a hand in his work. By doing so, you will inspire others in their efforts to make it happen.\n\nThanks for reading the above post and will you be so kind as to leave a comment with your favorite and his greatest moments.","token_len":374,"entropy":[9.7292,3.5007,9.1003,3.9316,3.6332,0.4487,5.6526,1.4769,3.0904,8.05,9.8255,3.8258,4.6088,1.1022,3.5917,2.1784,0.8045,11.5774,3.5756,3.3375,2.9838,3.3202,5.1582,3.5514,4.369,5.6328,6.4742,1.7064,9.8258,2.6047,11.6697,0.6558,2.2806,1.6768,6.8355,0.0494,0.8008,3.0202,2.766,1.9457,0.2089,3.1391,0.4194,0.0605,0.7104,3.1285,4.9867,1.6764,5.9767,3.0269,0.6523,4.2154,2.8161,1.3763,3.6432,6.2245,5.2375,1.681,4.0547,0.4555,5.3548,5.1438,1.6978,3.0357,0.5773,4.4334,1.4714,3.904,1.994,5.9673,0.9134,5.201,1.7029,4.4317,5.5868,1.3487,1.0628,0.0027,5.0396,5.6419,1.2474,5.7617,3.255,1.8569,5.5146,0.0511,4.1948,1.2307,5.004,1.0234,3.8796,1.7719,4.6859,0.029,4.8523,4.5646,2.7568,3.0319,2.7373,2.701,3.0545,1.6022,0.7085,0.8584,6.8585,1.0327,0.7109,0.3347,2.3816,3.2229,4.4708,4.6002,3.2693,3.0695,0.7385,3.6068,1.7923,0.1742,1.999,0.0123,0.9855,2.7617,1.6771,3.291,2.679,1.8946,0.5949,2.4966,2.5601,0.9404,4.6509,5.366,1.2109,0.3209,1.591,5.7977,0.0324,0.019,2.3341,1.0401,3.4936,3.7854,2.6364,5.2568,4.653,3.2792,2.9226,2.8506,0.2258,0.0001,0.0796,2.0733,2.648,5.4184,2.4836,5.4695,4.3802,2.7081,1.8289,0.4932,6.4726,0.2911,2.0368,4.9726,0.1447,3.4864,3.6413,0.5576,0.7611,5.2125,3.7947,2.5533,6.5927,1.5735,1.5587,2.2755,3.3959,5.0826,4.5329,0.6992,1.0552,0.0002,4.023,2.6643,4.8417,4.7871,0.023,2.3601,2.0784,4.8158,0.9547,4.3728,5.5951,2.0245,1.838,3.3277,0.2606,3.2897,2.3508,2.8816,2.3246,0.5475,1.814,0.2511,4.0134,0.7677,4.9867,2.4245,0.009,3.8676,0.6103,0.8367,0.3649,0.9644,5.9171,1.0597,1.9621,1.4763,2.2439,1.033,2.331,3.7267,2.0702,4.5614,5.2665,0.598,0.4953,2.6775,0.4498,1.6054,1.3163,3.8589,1.8973,2.3234,2.0954,5.5372,1.991,5.854,0.9202,3.1099,2.7914,1.5553,0.3694,5.8539,0.0012,6.6234,4.4383,5.584,1.4825,3.8554,2.2614,2.3176,0.0002,4.3172,4.6798,4.2887,4.5855,0.3112,3.9696,2.7662,2.4579,1.2353,3.4913,2.0361,5.8602,0.2459,1.2044,0.0013,2.3312,5.9316,1.8519,1.8238,1.2127,4.8589,1.9069,3.3147,5.6045,0.9508,0.395,2.2337,2.7699,0.2415,0.1497,1.734,5.2997,1.9092,3.6516,0.0916,1.6374,1.4815,2.3033,4.1912,0.3547,0.0575,2.7052,3.2279,5.5183,1.1517,2.0532,2.7457,1.3252,4.2911,3.0925,2.3609,2.4376,4.6557,4.0073,0.7949,0.799,0.1372,3.4156,2.9519,1.7422,2.8788,1.0024,2.433,4.0593,3.2537,2.1766,0.0491,4.7473,1.6734,5.7043,1.7355,2.9515,5.8737,0.5648,1.2949,1.7841,0.2066,6.8485,2.6796,0.0527,0.3536,0.2133,0.793,6.018,0.9678,3.3287,2.2198,2.122,0.6947,2.9849,3.9159,1.6799,0.3128,0.5648,0.0002,4.5895,1.2075,0.8863,5.1445,3.3301,4.0988,1.428,4.4382,1.6358,1.7984,3.9414,0.6794,0.8866,0.2009,4.5541,0.4007,0.3754,3.0978,0.4129,4.3519,4.6644,5.4373,5.7254,5.1485,0.7766]}
{"id":1323,"ended":true,"length":345,"gen_text":"On September 5, a tropical cyclone formed off the coast of Costa Rica. It also headed northwest and dissipated over the southern part of Baja California on September 15. The lowest reported rainfall in September has been in the Pacific Ocean.\nIt was the fourth year in a row in which a Category 5 storm did not exceed a category 4 high, and the first major time it did not come close enough to reaching the storm.\nWith this season's landfall total up to 1,500 kilometers away, all three storms were on the high seas\u2014along with a small number of low-lying coastal areas in the western Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Northwest wind from the storm was more powerful and more strong than normal on September 1 but had only a slight dip over the Pacific Northwest. A few of the storm's strongest winds were later on the coast of the Western Pacific but the strongest winds were in the North Atlantic Sea.\nThe hurricane center was a massive, cyclone-shaped storm and is generally located between the Atlantic, South and North Atlantic.\nTropical storm activity peaked in late September during the second half of September and then dropped to the lowest level in years in late September, with low-lying areas of the eastern Pacific now moving inland inland. Winds from the Atlantic to South Atlantic range from 30 km\/h to 55 km\/h, making it the most common hurricane in the eastern tropical Pacific region.\nThe current storms' main source of activity was tropical cyclones: cyclones that were particularly vulnerable to the wind at the time of landfall. They could provide the required momentum to further grow the storm's strength, but were especially difficult to manage due to their small size.\nBecause the large number of cyclones in the western Pacific Ocean is expected to continue to decline, there will probably be a few more at the beginning of 2018.","token_len":374,"entropy":[7.5319,3.4721,0.3214,4.3141,10.0236,3.8959,0.0037,5.9628,3.3181,0.646,0.7655,0.0245,4.7297,0.0039,1.4099,2.1305,4.9673,6.7334,3.8769,3.0773,8.156,0.003,3.1705,0.6944,3.6135,1.9153,0.0051,7.0457,0.0621,0.0398,3.1014,0.2552,4.105,0.46,2.0492,7.6961,5.805,2.9418,1.6429,3.9694,4.4095,0.391,2.366,0.7437,4.0464,0.9025,1.2339,0.651,13.3037,1.4876,1.9616,2.9943,4.5078,0.5395,0.0797,0.0022,2.7202,0.17,1.4697,3.8133,1.0167,0.9334,5.518,0.0626,5.0548,2.656,4.0135,1.9841,5.9764,2.5399,2.2695,1.083,2.3472,5.2973,6.9463,2.5253,1.6875,1.8061,4.2374,1.1863,5.0023,0.1092,3.4972,1.2567,5.4105,2.7914,0.8098,4.8099,3.7493,4.8675,0.6089,4.9361,5.8869,4.9088,0.7243,3.6926,0.4444,2.7309,2.6917,2.8184,0.6378,5.5991,3.3037,0.974,1.959,4.7938,1.9225,5.01,2.4836,5.8058,5.3094,0.8014,2.1225,4.5269,2.5802,0.1264,3.3964,0.1296,0.8983,3.1404,1.2942,2.8292,0.7193,3.7802,0.8079,1.3584,0.3938,2.6431,3.8627,2.8123,5.4419,4.9595,1.025,2.3354,1.3539,4.2221,1.752,2.4296,2.7577,4.1759,0.3935,3.1093,2.7655,0.4238,3.6834,5.0604,3.6158,4.0992,0.9112,2.1903,2.0714,2.541,0.4068,2.9215,2.5214,1.6007,4.913,3.2249,3.4776,0.295,2.7861,0.5272,1.4657,0.8525,1.2126,5.5304,3.3334,1.1342,3.0895,0.8549,2.3875,4.5738,0.7963,2.7713,2.5673,2.2278,1.3219,1.5466,2.4825,0.1998,3.6935,1.4782,6.0266,0.7639,0.3566,1.3634,3.9877,4.9103,1.6114,3.6373,4.7961,2.5653,5.1407,0.2593,0.3173,3.1622,3.7953,4.7442,3.9314,5.8273,3.5031,3.1312,0.9531,2.8318,4.1501,3.0475,2.8669,1.6136,0.713,0.9059,2.0012,5.6912,1.565,0.0199,3.2222,2.4242,4.6929,0.7256,2.5198,1.0421,4.7449,0.7494,3.7623,1.397,0.0008,3.1801,1.7004,2.5454,3.2867,2.3087,2.5602,0.7733,0.8273,1.3662,4.6134,2.5509,1.509,1.4685,1.9902,2.5233,3.6069,1.3151,0.3876,0.6796,1.7026,0.3087,2.3383,0.782,4.7001,5.6038,2.1568,6.3779,0.6496,4.654,2.7603,0.6314,3.4768,1.8596,4.1224,2.7704,5.0233,0.4132,3.4242,2.9073,0.1708,0.0688,0.6128,3.9681,0.0271,0.0024,0.001,1.2792,4.2162,1.2761,0.9545,1.7577,4.0873,2.1286,2.4368,0.4281,3.0801,3.5531,0.2207,1.9312,0.2284,0.6411,1.3067,5.2519,5.9509,4.2825,5.1316,3.1677,0.0198,1.9769,2.1005,4.4207,0.1848,1.0185,5.8815,3.7366,0.3576,0.8923,3.212,5.3223,6.098,0.1982,2.3642,4.0251,5.2378,1.4943,0.4813,0.272,0.557,0.8042,3.8979,4.0154,5.6968,3.0192,5.3067,4.3969,0.6296,5.3346,5.2098,1.0547,0.685,1.1398,1.128,1.5965,1.6913,3.2639,4.4824,2.4896,0.0962,3.7121,2.1386,0.0069,1.6688,3.8851,0.7875,1.0606,0.7234,5.4742,1.5536,6.0442,2.6047,0.0228,1.7698,0.09,1.6512,0.2976,3.0362,0.5097,1.7305,2.115,3.3805,0.0205,1.9117,0.5906,4.9974,1.1408,3.1112,1.7912,3.9591,0.2689,1.8892,2.2783,0.9334,5.7612,0.9912,3.4433,0.0224,3.1592,0.7943]}

The first series will be raced at Monaco next month, with the second series at Abu Dhabi in early October.\n\nThe teams will be open for business after their qualifying in Monaco tomorrow, with an announcement expected in a little over a week.","token_len":377,"entropy":[5.7666,2.402,11.6821,3.3012,2.4565,6.322,2.5545,1.5692,0.8359,8.6368,1.8065,1.1557,1.441,1.8927,2.1959,3.5925,1.2916,2.2126,3.5458,0.1999,6.6815,0.0693,3.7659,2.8488,1.7123,5.9087,7.2138,4.5412,3.7944,7.1351,1.9857,0.4006,2.6222,1.1726,1.7047,12.2995,2.5677,1.1591,4.5575,2.9471,2.3511,2.4321,6.0302,4.7912,0.8653,2.8473,3.5959,4.9379,5.5492,1.5537,4.0343,3.5155,3.5964,3.517,1.7634,2.1026,0.9271,0.7252,0.0008,3.699,1.5483,3.7344,5.456,1.6083,0.751,0.992,3.6515,1.7359,0.4361,0.2326,1.4722,4.6653,5.9062,1.4287,5.2986,2.3085,0.374,0.0085,2.7262,1.533,4.8725,0.0223,3.3885,1.3492,2.7221,4.0235,3.5778,1.4682,5.7848,1.0931,5.0328,2.0072,1.2842,4.3505,4.7857,4.5119,0.068,1.9101,5.0685,6.2552,1.1246,4.5464,0.8872,0.0081,0.6364,2.0182,0.1428,0.7827,0.0002,4.4701,5.7331,3.0369,0.4886,0.6569,4.0024,0.0213,3.3011,0.7727,4.4474,1.5403,1.3576,1.2318,4.408,5.5858,1.3633,1.787,1.1956,2.607,3.0213,5.3333,2.8426,3.7024,4.7371,4.1994,1.9034,2.0347,0.0003,3.8912,4.3932,4.6481,0.0095,1.8886,5.6706,1.284,0.002,0.0001,0.0008,0.0007,3.7963,2.0996,0.5195,4.655,2.9442,1.1987,10.7013,3.1091,0.7438,2.0764,5.806,0.137,3.4865,6.4024,2.2443,2.3523,2.6727,3.0473,3.6816,0.0996,0.0252,1.7859,1.243,3.8312,1.7604,1.9505,1.0797,1.593,3.6674,3.7458,4.498,1.2004,0.0255,0.5123,3.8063,1.6293,2.6475,1.5113,0.0952,4.6477,2.1109,1.686,3.3417,4.751,2.0091,2.6793,4.8393,0.6459,0.1187,1.1622,3.9618,0.7577,0.5563,0.3374,1.199,5.1631,3.6728,0.0009,0.9163,3.7045,0.2344,6.061,0.0054,1.1299,1.8279,0.7852,0.2686,1.1154,1.657,1.2086,3.9818,5.4192,0.007,3.0768,2.8961,4.1142,0.3566,4.1775,3.0823,2.2153,3.2776,6.0966,2.3438,0.7358,0.5283,0.0003,2.4262,6.3794,3.3456,4.597,2.4408,0.9516,6.0776,2.7857,0.0014,0.2904,0.891,6.0269,1.0549,2.2391,1.1284,2.7674,2.173,2.0271,2.0598,5.3956,4.5274,4.4838,2.7127,1.6455,0.3036,4.1746,0.6594,1.4037,2.5542,3.2409,2.5897,3.1944,2.9534,2.8719,1.7752,0.5563,0.7905,0.6718,4.6135,0.5548,5.1883,1.0246,2.7484,0.7934,4.1168,1.2229,0.9463,4.3162,0.468,1.3502,0.9993,4.9965,0.0973,5.8996,1.5907,5.7088,0.4631,1.1567,3.6498,0.598,4.4465,2.27,5.6895,4.6567,1.5438,3.7273,3.515,1.6327,0.3197,1.2149,0.6819,3.8686,0.6299,0.064,1.4321,1.6134,3.7456,1.064,1.4217,0.1332,2.3197,6.5685,5.9482,4.3406,5.1961,4.279,3.0371,4.7715,0.1277,1.4895,5.2572,0.8073,1.1972,2.9374,2.468,2.2352,0.9596,1.4131,5.5415,2.1594,5.9665,2.9069,1.9593,0.5416,1.776,0.8511,0.674,1.7186,2.6173,3.903,0.0002,1.1155,2.7157,3.3906,0.2598,0.4376,0.0002,1.8484,5.1692,1.7902,1.6902,5.7282,1.7687,3.1174,4.6828,3.2568,3.8925,3.3183,1.9493,5.8821,0.9133,1.2962,4.9348,2.2017,1.0053,2.0895,3.0893,4.9347,0.1273,0.9921,0.3594,0.5016]}
{"id":1390,"ended":true,"length":344,"gen_text":"In 1867 Ezra Millard, Andrew J. Hanscom, and Augustus Kountze formed the Omaha Horse Railway Company to provide horsecar service in the city. By the late 1870s the line had five miles of motor service in Omaha in the year 1871 and 1871 combined.\n\nThe Omaha Horse Company was known for their outstanding service equipment and great reputation. Many visitors to the city included the Omaha Motorist and the Omaha Rubber Band, who owned and operated four horse racing fields before 1842 and 1843 during Omaha's three-week industrial revolution.\n\nWhen he became president of the company he made no significant changes to the structure or operation of the horses or the operation of the lines. In the 1869 article he stated:\n\n\"The company is the second with a horse race, after the Omaha Ladies's Club, by the Omaha Ladies' Club. One can only be the first in Omaha to have won this race, and the company can boast that it has won many awards and is the only company with such success, and that in a short period of time, its lines have made some of the best racing track in the entire United States.\"\n\nIt wasn't long before the company's first races in Omaha were a reality. There were three races in 1852 (in 1855, 1865, 1876, and 1878 ). It was also the year when the Omaha National Guard had its first horse training program. At the beginning of the 1880s, the company had nearly 18,000 horses. The company had over 1,500 horse race horses that year as well, and more than 70 horse racing fields were organized during the previous year.\n\nIt would be an achievement to record these events in their entirety and to display their accomplishment in a permanent space so their descendants can remember the long distance of their horses while they raced.","token_len":378,"entropy":[7.5831,4.2414,10.4407,6.6125,2.8786,1.6843,9.1052,3.4995,0.1443,9.4344,4.4976,0.566,1.0833,8.2643,4.8134,8.1265,2.9062,6.0371,0.6149,11.2465,9.2391,8.1902,0.5761,2.9952,3.0966,11.7478,6.4304,4.6211,3.9861,2.1345,0.9198,5.0309,0.8646,4.4545,2.151,2.8677,2.2794,0.378,1.6144,4.9349,0.8324,7.8816,2.9985,0.1521,5.9164,2.4284,3.1482,1.4474,5.3115,2.2253,4.1414,0.919,1.4254,2.3081,3.1816,3.0565,4.0946,0.5639,1.8144,0.0024,1.7703,2.0884,1.2599,1.5858,1.6522,4.3976,1.0788,2.0893,4.5504,1.2697,6.5006,1.1634,4.6477,2.7865,1.383,3.9887,5.4563,0.892,1.0384,1.6825,5.1906,2.3543,2.6852,3.4471,2.7305,2.5547,1.791,1.0835,5.7706,2.8691,1.9624,1.6567,4.6065,1.5278,0.1253,5.2499,2.0343,3.7311,5.1338,5.5998,3.8409,5.1446,3.0013,1.8408,0.9532,6.3909,4.2279,0.268,4.9743,1.7606,3.4587,5.9492,2.2871,0.1627,0.8903,0.0002,5.1392,6.4172,3.5174,1.6214,0.7155,0.1225,2.276,3.4429,3.6577,4.4142,6.0183,0.4527,0.6703,0.5139,3.1796,1.9373,3.4138,0.1248,0.1807,3.9612,2.2563,1.855,3.2789,0.058,0.4709,3.8552,0.7277,2.4858,2.8979,3.2964,2.9979,5.6333,2.6769,2.5731,1.5752,0.9199,0.0005,0.7966,1.4612,3.5679,2.1305,3.3895,5.0635,6.1924,1.9841,4.2136,3.7867,2.462,2.0946,0.4699,2.8728,6.1534,3.789,1.8963,1.1676,5.1929,1.4948,1.8329,3.6536,0.4239,0.2937,1.4619,5.3054,4.7762,2.276,4.1657,4.8993,0.8289,2.2015,1.0952,0.8824,2.2558,4.6922,4.2879,1.3861,2.0681,0.9604,1.8349,3.6184,5.4604,2.9278,3.0287,0.9123,0.7023,1.5485,3.5746,4.9106,2.272,3.3679,1.9217,1.9328,1.33,2.7908,3.2491,2.9921,3.5911,1.9217,2.4543,3.2138,3.128,1.9674,1.7588,0.317,0.059,1.8111,3.1611,5.6305,0.7594,3.8516,4.7553,1.8085,0.0945,1.2538,3.2439,5.9392,0.3634,0.3543,4.8359,1.6613,0.0117,0.8562,0.2075,0.0002,4.2508,4.9274,0.0015,2.4583,0.291,0.7673,1.6778,2.7679,3.5779,5.4854,2.9703,1.2453,0.9699,4.8646,4.0653,0.4727,5.4287,0.3932,3.4573,1.3519,1.2973,1.3263,6.3148,4.2224,3.8954,3.2432,2.601,1.1295,5.4935,0.4862,2.2225,2.9368,0.7027,0.2408,0.3912,1.8968,10.0654,3.6785,0.681,2.8567,1.724,1.9728,3.4062,0.8773,1.5297,6.1856,2.5238,5.1782,1.7289,0.2198,2.4488,4.5797,2.6248,0.9292,4.9247,0.9622,2.4382,0.0426,0.5634,3.4872,0.221,1.2385,0.7788,0.978,1.9838,5.2662,4.6771,0.187,0.0386,1.168,2.2096,2.2647,1.681,2.1887,4.5817,2.9147,0.0907,1.6563,2.6742,3.2964,2.6783,3.7246,0.9512,4.1445,0.1535,3.5029,1.3357,3.8611,0.5773,4.3895,3.0991,1.6087,3.0285,1.8136,4.558,3.1026,0.764,6.2998,1.593,0.2902,0.5692,0.0002,3.8648,3.8673,0.7363,3.9816,6.4426,0.7858,5.0356,3.4377,1.8141,1.5824,4.0738,0.2677,2.4715,1.4713,4.7626,2.6833,4.9303,1.1675,1.9351,5.2623,5.6974,4.8712,5.7451,3.8154,0.8467,2.3013,1.9688,5.6333,6.0689,3.3743,1.4211,3.866,5.8065,1.2845,2.4204,1.1348]}

The company ended up losing $ 2 million on cash and stock sales, $ 2.9 million on other things and $ 1.1 million in revenue.\n\nThe latest issue of Forbes Money magazine revealed that Gentry has sold $4.8 billion of its shares so far and is expected to report revenues up to $18.8 billion in 2011.\n\nSources close to the valuation said the company was already struggling financially. The company has been under tremendous pressure with more than 200 layoffs including 3,000 employees on staff and 2,500 full-time positions closing this month.\n\nAccording to one of those employees, Ellen Thompson, the former head of Gentry Corporation, Gentry is trying to push its share price even higher. The company had expected Gentry to win about $1.1 billion, and to lose about $100 million by ending up with just 10% of its revenues from operations.\n\nAccording to Gentry spokesman Dave Thompson, the valuation of the company's assets should have already set a firm target of $2 billion for 2012, but there were no immediate projections of where the company might even be. When asked if Gentry believes its share price will fall beyond what it will be in 2013, Thompson said, \"We don't have any business prediction. We're just very short of that.\"\n\nIn response to Variety's report on Gentry, James M. Gentry Jr, the founder and CEO of Apple, reiterated he is \"open to discussing a strategy if necessary.\"\n\n\"We're not going to give up our position in the Apple brand,\" he said, \"We're a little more open in the long run.\"","token_len":379,"entropy":[10.5842,3.7093,2.7167,7.8728,9.0606,1.5997,5.3727,5.1271,6.6605,5.7619,0.7197,2.194,4.9684,0.7408,15.9923,14.5311,6.8011,6.6743,6.47,4.3233,2.8454,5.4419,0.0561,1.2573,1.2155,4.3948,3.5019,0.4434,2.3482,5.8821,7.818,0.3293,0.7989,1.3699,0.1226,6.5103,1.3286,3.9642,0.3968,2.6993,2.2591,5.0016,0.6349,1.5825,0.6188,3.3718,2.4226,2.897,5.8835,1.3499,0.4809,5.403,1.92,2.6894,2.1704,1.3101,3.088,0.0991,0.8063,4.6583,4.8009,1.8898,0.2928,1.6281,0.29,2.594,0.0313,1.4326,2.9005,0.5794,1.0177,0.0011,2.4467,5.9154,5.2437,0.2617,2.511,4.2191,1.3855,4.6714,0.5787,5.0408,4.148,3.0756,2.8927,2.3024,4.0172,0.526,2.5134,1.2833,1.4749,1.7525,1.6219,2.9711,0.0008,3.0789,1.7455,1.8821,0.0059,4.4369,4.8222,5.1072,0.6394,0.0436,4.6416,1.4545,2.4631,0.0306,1.4309,6.0808,0.4098,1.1129,0.0003,5.632,1.1791,0.0034,0.6896,5.5997,1.965,1.4635,1.4553,2.7314,3.8686,4.6152,1.9294,2.0101,2.0969,1.5055,2.4504,1.9064,2.8044,5.5868,0.1988,4.5899,5.6927,0.1997,4.3663,1.8658,5.7348,5.2549,0.7688,0.4743,1.7767,4.6778,2.5331,1.5364,3.5085,0.0493,1.8326,3.7526,0.3357,0.0045,1.8608,6.0813,2.5581,1.8684,0.2363,0.574,0.0002,4.2744,0.0025,4.329,2.9278,2.9513,1.6924,0.1191,6.6739,5.8247,0.1315,2.3143,2.8263,2.5016,0.0259,2.2153,0.0613,6.7047,0.477,0.8711,0.3867,2.8106,4.2474,0.0551,5.1551,1.8534,3.4407,0.2005,4.068,0.4482,1.3052,2.9182,1.2428,3.7347,4.7837,2.5949,0.0046,0.2885,5.4612,4.3548,0.8301,2.383,1.3384,2.7684,0.0788,3.1829,3.545,4.5536,2.3576,1.9798,0.087,3.1872,0.093,2.6575,5.7948,1.8019,0.9,3.5631,4.8995,2.1366,0.4311,0.9941,4.6213,3.5299,4.252,0.5151,0.3965,0.0002,4.0403,0.0029,3.158,0.0372,5.2182,4.841,5.8243,0.0817,1.1215,6.0633,1.718,1.0583,0.4557,1.6388,2.9302,5.2566,3.6632,5.1217,5.9497,1.3269,4.2709,0.8741,0.4247,0.3767,3.0667,1.0017,2.6924,2.1659,1.6485,2.0592,4.8602,2.3198,2.3507,2.9624,5.0623,1.5873,3.9434,1.1725,0.2766,2.9142,5.9675,1.297,1.3153,6.4718,1.6728,1.4614,1.3626,0.0024,6.1631,1.8969,3.074,0.0778,1.0463,2.7067,6.234,3.454,1.0411,4.6526,1.1821,1.2558,2.8614,0.1387,0.1719,0.6922,1.0121,0.0232,1.2875,2.1263,0.0005,1.5855,0.9287,5.759,5.611,2.5813,0.7532,1.3663,1.604,5.1162,5.9232,1.7068,2.5279,1.2988,0.3911,0.0002,3.3924,4.5157,0.1197,5.7748,0.3385,2.309,2.4982,0.7937,0.0024,1.0309,6.5412,4.8129,0.6928,3.2701,0.1505,2.4524,5.2105,1.659,2.8617,1.0141,0.6535,0.2141,6.4673,0.6298,4.8108,5.1795,2.1073,1.689,4.8934,0.4708,3.6019,2.879,5.0016,5.577,2.8974,0.6099,0.7747,0.0002,1.031,1.3414,1.693,1.9774,1.5377,0.0723,3.5554,0.5177,2.2528,3.1219,1.8348,1.0143,1.6605,3.4297,1.1445,0.7432,0.2779,2.3965,1.2443,2.462,0.6302,4.1581,5.3734,1.6085,1.031,4.8915,1.6775,4.8695,0.7562,1.2802]}

He gradually declined physically and mentally and displayed extreme withdrawal from alcohol that ended up leading to major symptoms of cancer.\n\nBut his case did not end with Dr Pepper. Dr Pepper was still the only alcoholic-crazed alcoholic he ever saw, and he became an expert on his condition. He was also called upon to explain why and when the drinking became increasingly erratic in the first few years he had to put his life on hold for 12 years.\n\nHe died, aged 75, in 1957 with two other co-conspirators.\n\nDr Pepper never knew that he was dealing with cancer. In a note published the ensuing year in his journal:\n\n\"When asked what he did after the stroke, I told him that he had no choice but to go home. He was not ready to face some world that feared him. 'I will think of nothing to go off of until we have taken my place', he said.\n\n\"I am very sorry for what I have done in this dreadful matter and I can feel for many of those who had a share in it. But I know that when it is too late I regret all the pain I have caused.

He received a doctorate in theology and theology from C.K. M. Fyfe University, and his mother was a member of the church of Alexandria with two other priests.\n\nIn the 1820s he moved to Le Moyne where he became deeply involved with church doctrine. He published a number of works on the church. He also taught the church at Saint Nicholas College, his school for boys from 1848 until his death in 1913. He lived in the city, and later in the provinces. He left school, and returned to Paris in 1914, to study at Caron de Montdum College, his wife's college. He taught at Saint Catherine de Sales and founded the church for boys until 1939.\n\nHe began preaching after the war and subsequently served as a preacher in his youth. He attended the church through the remainder of the 1920s which was mostly French, with only a few exceptions.\n\nThe Church Of Saint Peter's was the first Catholic church built after the Restoration in the area where the church had been established in 1886. It remains that the church is situated in the Le Moyne Quarter, the main avenue for church-going and visitors.\n\nHe wrote a book titled The Holy Bible and a translation by Louis Pasteur, on the Holy Bible. It was also published in 1925 at the age of 36.","token_len":385,"entropy":[9.933,4.2742,3.9248,10.2418,11.9339,7.4479,6.4325,11.4523,1.2884,9.0483,6.1707,8.2288,3.4843,5.5652,3.2943,1.9848,5.111,2.8035,5.4534,4.3989,8.5978,2.076,7.7587,3.5766,2.4518,1.2009,6.0671,6.3544,0.1995,1.8785,0.0379,0.0049,2.5005,7.8047,4.5609,2.4199,0.3383,4.7533,1.2619,1.1177,10.1639,2.4137,0.0266,0.004,3.3522,7.9774,0.1253,8.3335,3.777,1.85,0.0182,5.1325,1.9222,0.2359,0.0175,4.8643,5.6624,5.5261,3.5049,1.0371,0.1518,0.0157,5.1086,3.3064,0.04,0.0088,5.6074,5.4449,3.4241,3.8079,1.0872,0.0368,5.0109,3.4375,2.9618,2.9238,0.0172,3.4312,0.1051,4.0342,0.8668,4.7215,4.9233,0.4951,0.0425,2.408,1.1737,0.05,4.8312,3.8304,3.8451,4.59,3.2368,1.4228,0.0142,0.0093,1.8478,2.0739,0.0285,2.7409,1.002,1.2766,5.2808,4.4997,1.4272,1.2282,5.0196,4.4764,2.7697,1.4679,4.7685,1.745,3.7729,0.0058,0.6865,3.1609,2.3171,2.6171,0.6729,5.675,1.1754,5.8749,0.1382,4.1,1.6468,5.5782,4.72,2.0299,1.9468,1.8555,2.9194,3.3069,4.0365,1.2636,1.0848,4.0297,0.0104,0.2852,4.6567,0.6944,5.2953,6.2216,5.1387,2.446,4.4249,0.6681,1.8499,0.0002,2.6888,3.0171,3.4055,1.1945,0.1019,1.4171,3.3972,0.2277,5.8267,5.4834,1.2991,3.7229,0.1472,2.403,5.7747,0.4313,1.7805,4.8743,4.7095,0.9398,0.9379,4.3662,1.8252,1.8128,0.0016,1.9182,1.3329,1.2295,3.0614,2.779,1.2387,2.2663,3.1444,3.1345,2.5288,1.8767,4.001,5.2697,1.9619,1.2882,5.8269,4.4752,1.5418,3.5817,3.8673,1.5484,4.2426,1.9832,1.5751,0.0927,0.5751,6.236,0.259,1.7136,4.7532,0.9979,2.0409,2.8507,3.9971,2.3161,3.9913,1.4573,1.9447,5.6431,1.0266,1.6365,4.5937,4.8662,4.0544,1.4165,3.4971,0.0925,1.5008,1.4812,2.9305,1.9038,2.714,1.8319,1.6903,6.7306,3.6108,1.9002,3.3511,5.4686,5.1118,4.95,1.2944,4.6782,4.1336,2.2257,2.5171,0.7632,1.2784,3.8236,1.1005,2.9227,4.6472,1.5928,2.018,2.2066,6.1324,0.7498,3.1397,4.834,1.7555,3.7492,5.8043,0.4497,0.7868,0.0002,1.5588,5.0149,3.7948,4.7266,1.5881,2.0874,1.8783,5.598,3.5427,0.8569,1.01,3.0421,1.3297,4.4265,2.7021,0.6065,0.7411,4.7646,1.308,3.579,6.1021,1.1828,5.5961,0.0009,0.8629,2.8304,0.0192,6.7971,1.5065,4.8216,5.7235,1.8958,3.2676,4.232,1.2739,0.3289,1.1843,0.4074,1.5055,0.0002,3.6956,3.5944,5.6037,1.7165,4.6131,3.1961,2.7734,4.3287,1.5914,4.0414,1.0724,4.9887,3.194,0.5909,4.9614,1.9821,1.8529,3.8844,4.1624,1.8444,2.391,2.4383,0.7227,1.6233,1.8055,5.6979,0.3874,1.6101,5.1642,5.7061,1.214,1.0169,1.9144,5.1378,0.9911,0.8696,5.8104,0.0867,0.0122,4.9935,1.2687,2.9765,3.8438,3.5836,2.9262,4.5237,4.1314,0.1598,3.5537,4.2513,1.1533,0.7821,0.0002,2.9559,4.6266,1.9477,1.9402,3.6013,1.7044,3.9836,2.7725,2.7751,3.2359,3.7006,3.0584,5.1264,3.8374,0.0186,1.9608,5.0533,0.7889,3.1067,0.8255,1.4106,2.605,0.7641,3.45,0.7125,0.6642,5.9428,4.7828,0.8219,3.2038,0.006,4.7743,0.4609]}

Following the withdrawal of General Frederick the Great, he joined the Indian Regiment for the final week of the war with the 4th Div of the 1st Infantry Division, later assigned to Division Headquarters, Washington, D.C.\n\nHe was shot nearly twenty times during an assault on a British outpost during the Battle of the Somme, 1809. As part of his recovery, he was also killed in a duel at Waterloo on 14 May.\n\nIn 1843 he held command of the French cavalry regiment in which he commanded on 18 May and on 20 May, 1844, after the American troops had taken over from General Charles I. On 23 May, he held the remainder of the French regiments for two rest days at the start of the battle.\n\nAfter France fell, Butler was the first officer to visit the dead.

{"id":1095,"ended":false,"length":370,"gen_text":"Over a 20 @ - @ year period during the late 20th century, there was an increase in the number of women in the workforce in Canada. This shift increased father participation in the workplace and in the workplace itself. The increase in paternity leave was accompanied by a rise in married men with kids. More women also were employed in the economy, and that in turn enabled men to retain leadership roles into the future.\n\n\"With this increase, [female] participation [in the workplace] increased. And in the economy, more women were employed in industry. Again, it helped men to retain leadership roles into the future. The rise of women in the workforce was accompanied by an increase in marital parity with men. As for paternity leave, as the work of a father was often tied to his baby or wife, women were asked what to do more effectively with that income. As with paternity leave, women were invited to take unpaid maternity leave but were required to work for pay and benefits.\n\n\"Again, as there was more work force participation, fathers who were working full-time during the late 20th century were more likely to engage in formal family law work and to get married. As for unpaid paternity leave, mothers who were involved in formal family law work (i.e., paid maternity leave where they didn't work full-time) were also most likely to experience the higher rates of low-pay employment. This trend was supported by the increase in the number of unmarried fathers aged 35 to 71.\"\n\n\"We can't talk about a decline that's as clear in the past three decades as we are now.

{"id":3481,"ended":true,"length":376,"gen_text":"Unicamp is generally regarded by the Brazilian population as Brazil's Area 51, with the government running a secret underground area purportedly called Pavilion 18, located under the Institute of Chemistry. In 2008, three high profile Brazilian drug suspects were convicted of plotting to smuggle cocaine to Brazil -- in other words, to get into the country and deliver it to Brazil-based criminals. The men were all ordered deported but were quickly brought back.\nWith this scheme, you could imagine Brazil's citizens living in the midst of yet another World War II-era global war on drugs. However, it actually happens to be the world's poorest country. The rich will always try their best to stay out of trouble. The rich will never find out for certain what happened to them, with the wealthy the sole exception: If you want your money back, you'll never have more money than you have.\nWith the US trying to push back hard against them, Brazil is slowly but surely becoming a safer and more secure country. In fact, as of writing this week, the Brazilian economy has a net growth rate of 20.7 percent. That's good enough to offset nearly 75 percent of the world's population on average - and some 20 million people are now living in countries where the United States controls everything. That's good enough to offset almost 95 percent of the world's population, which is currently on the decline.\nBrazil's government is also working to put an end to the drugs war by implementing an end to the World Trade Center's bombing program. It will bring about an end to that bombing as well, and it's going to make it easier for our poor countries to become a little more economically conscious of their own economic fate - and, ultimately, to stop taking drugs from people on our streets, as they did back in the 1990s. One way or another, their governments are going to stop us all from ending our addiction to drugs.","token_len":389,"entropy":[7.1815,7.7094,3.9342,6.8429,3.3771,3.4626,2.7209,7.4265,4.5405,0.2178,5.3655,0.0263,14.0079,4.1968,1.8096,2.235,2.0241,5.1489,6.9242,1.5115,5.0408,4.6587,7.1138,11.3064,4.7161,11.9054,5.6349,1.7411,3.5533,4.8688,0.5772,7.82,0.5293,6.1684,1.4896,3.4596,5.0609,0.237,5.9532,5.3547,2.3534,2.2289,3.3326,3.7638,0.5426,2.9173,0.6073,4.5413,0.4148,3.2009,0.0002,2.0125,2.4681,0.9991,7.0799,4.2801,4.6002,0.0054,0.0711,1.4277,3.296,3.0872,1.041,0.7462,2.9783,5.6969,0.9811,0.443,2.0958,5.17,1.172,3.5764,0.6337,2.4173,5.3626,1.0936,3.8155,5.1111,2.7634,4.8613,1.6101,4.6608,3.8888,0.1832,3.3326,0.9974,14.4497,3.3976,5.7388,0.8907,5.4793,2.5335,3.3701,3.2333,1.3332,5.3952,4.0314,0.9007,2.1878,4.8342,0.0015,6.3385,0.0633,5.4617,0.1706,0.4385,1.0287,0.5511,5.8315,0.9443,1.9493,0.0548,0.5863,4.6938,0.0476,2.7355,6.3967,5.6428,2.105,0.4327,1.6708,3.4487,0.0499,5.1894,0.2633,1.0252,2.3609,5.4559,4.9034,2.6952,4.7458,3.9848,0.7781,0.1239,4.6926,1.086,0.1525,1.6702,1.6509,2.7257,3.0039,1.6687,3.3827,4.4558,1.8438,5.8619,3.012,2.4035,2.5817,0.4098,0.7582,2.2823,5.829,1.2709,5.0519,5.231,4.0599,1.3109,3.8982,5.7135,1.0926,3.0864,4.5513,1.0915,0.2883,0.3136,0.5563,1.9519,3.2317,1.6339,6.1957,1.9292,1.3139,0.6162,1.0194,1.3948,0.9686,4.0659,1.7331,4.9457,5.5704,0.0863,5.1377,1.8014,3.095,0.4944,6.1551,0.3778,2.1243,1.4346,4.3532,2.0925,0.0783,2.5942,1.0313,4.918,3.3824,0.476,2.3446,2.0358,0.369,3.1023,1.3905,0.0203,3.6586,2.1356,5.4138,1.2162,4.4543,0.1624,1.5213,2.7661,2.5231,1.8358,4.3576,2.7574,3.968,0.0493,0.0923,5.7188,1.2732,2.0922,1.1386,1.9708,3.107,0.7798,3.8643,2.3903,0.5194,5.3996,4.6572,5.5521,0.1425,0.105,0.6021,3.303,0.0382,2.4571,5.2633,0.5671,5.0351,1.7301,5.1605,4.4471,1.8819,1.6282,2.4556,2.9351,0.5063,0.438,3.5736,1.6659,1.6147,3.5783,0.0165,4.4412,5.7167,0.648,4.1802,0.7211,3.0738,1.5599,0.5026,1.0488,1.5766,4.8837,0.0227,0.0123,0.387,0.224,0.0503,0.1724,3.8459,2.6949,0.97,4.4051,2.9762,1.2082,3.4046,0.4424,0.6838,2.4887,1.4928,3.8484,1.4477,2.6471,3.0262,1.0879,4.2652,2.2459,0.0217,0.0049,0.9669,5.2884,3.3075,2.609,3.9942,2.9963,3.8146,0.3599,1.0841,5.794,0.5471,1.1129,4.2955,2.4592,1.5732,0.5956,3.39,2.9996,5.1412,2.5071,2.5739,0.1275,0.0269,4.8154,0.9014,4.6302,0.0973,1.2343,2.0364,2.2098,2.1398,2.3383,0.0173,3.1527,1.8011,1.9013,0.2774,5.8647,4.3756,3.5194,0.1432,4.2545,2.5645,3.9882,1.2954,5.0571,5.1472,1.6681,0.8284,2.0168,3.1684,4.5339,4.4326,1.5814,3.7367,2.7486,0.0138,1.5631,4.2649,4.2181,1.1951,2.1029,3.4526,3.6004,3.1341,0.8278,3.4709,3.1821,1.932,2.5538,3.4395,0.2928,0.2071,3.4431,0.0763,0.1444,6.3018,2.7561,0.743,0.1514,0.0768,5.487,4.4663,1.0594,0.3107,0.005,3.8493,4.8431,2.5813,1.182,5.7454,2.4043,2.8346,0.7699,0.7298,0.5321]}

After moving across the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea without development, the system moved through the Intertropical Convergence Zone, or ISZ, to move to southern Europe and Australia\n\nThe wave formed near the northern tip of the Pacific Ocean and moved to the south-central Bahamas\n\nIt landed at the port of Muntin, on June 10 and was followed by similar waves after coming to rest at the port of Cape Verde on June 11. The wave reached Muntin on Thursday, but stayed in the island's interior after being stopped by police with two other waves that had washed ashore.\n\nResearchers said that on July 15 it was found to be about 15 meters long. The waves were found to have longitude of 6.6 kilometers, making it one of four offshore winds with average winds at about 6.8 kilometers. The other two waves had similar speed, and the wave appeared to be travelling at 8,000 feet.\n\nScientists have used wind tunnel calculations to show some of the winds have increased with time. Based on the wind tunnel measurements, researchers found that the wind speed from the wind tunnel was about 3 miles per hour, about 2 miles per hour higher than recorded during the 1990s.\n\nIn the 2011-2012 years, which ended two years ago, the total wind speed increased by 23 knots.

Plastic razor wire, hand painted in shades of gray and silver using red, green and blue tones, creates a sense of urgency. Gordon would continue using the light blue to create 'em to work their way through a scene, and later using red, green and blue to make his own appearance.\n\nThe director is credited as a co-director on the film, and during special effects at the box office he has directed the following:\n\nGordon & The Wizard of Oz\n\nFor review of the director \/ director ratio he mentions that on Warner Bros. he received \"in exchange\" an undisclosed number of copies of his film:\n\nThe Wizard of Oz Rated R: R\n\n(Based on George G.R. Martin's The Great Gatsby: The Story Of The Great Migration and is also about the fallibility of fairy tale characters in a modern society.)\n\nWhile filming, he got his very first cut of a film titled \"The Wizard of Oz\", which was released on January 18, 1989 on a DVD disc with the movie title, \"We Will Rock Our Way From Bad To Evil.\" Gordon's own name came up as the star of the film, so this is where the title may be misleading.\n\nAfter The Wizarding Oz was released in theaters and on the Warner Bros. Digital Distribution System the same year (the two days before it was released on Blu-ray) after three releases on Blu Ray, this same episode will mark the first time that film has been screened at large theaters. The film went on to play at the box office on February 21, 1991 and this is how it stacks up.\n\nThere has been at least two sequels written about the movie and this one is the first to be titled \"The Wizard of Oz.\"","token_len":393,"entropy":[10.682,1.9269,8.2093,7.5351,0.0899,5.0973,0.4614,8.9007,0.5424,7.2352,0.5268,2.3724,5.1375,2.8392,6.5586,1.4174,6.1129,4.1664,6.6454,0.0094,6.8333,2.9642,3.1388,5.8523,15.2955,8.2811,4.2763,7.0424,9.3911,0.1599,1.578,10.9916,11.9157,3.5229,2.2612,5.3258,2.2636,4.6914,5.7894,0.1053,3.4923,1.9846,4.582,6.4963,5.7466,1.5087,1.5204,0.7447,0.5298,4.1133,1.482,5.7457,0.7185,4.5153,0.0226,3.8638,1.7874,4.0573,5.4486,5.2545,5.0807,1.5205,5.667,3.3626,3.8562,1.8057,6.1217,5.2532,5.3526,5.3881,4.2014,0.7567,0.684,3.306,2.1458,1.7661,2.4425,4.254,4.0936,3.1214,1.4632,0.1922,0.1096,0.0483,1.1417,3.2887,2.8684,2.1893,5.8684,0.5634,1.27,0.0316,2.1243,5.413,4.1888,3.3128,2.0699,3.4367,3.8795,0.0278,2.9912,1.8438,1.2012,0.9478,1.2778,1.6374,5.887,6.216,0.0435,4.9932,1.035,5.3898,0.0443,2.1191,3.3601,3.6171,2.3555,3.2131,2.7568,0.7029,0.0002,4.549,4.2465,3.5487,6.2093,0.4752,0.0287,1.3426,0.0003,5.8052,6.5286,1.7718,1.1223,4.7998,6.9709,1.591,5.253,6.1058,5.3156,2.4526,5.5299,6.2314,0.3782,0.777,2.4368,4.6301,3.8237,5.7649,5.2222,0.925,3.6099,3.9785,2.5575,0.0247,3.8305,0.1514,3.173,1.5116,4.065,0.33,0.0003,2.5166,2.2105,0.0913,0.0459,6.0252,2.069,3.2642,2.3035,1.1756,0.0002,4.2711,5.8115,0.0564,6.1577,3.8032,1.8857,3.6373,0.0608,0.2778,0.1038,1.9879,4.7924,1.0696,0.0001,0.0002,3.5276,1.2333,2.7902,2.9614,1.4441,3.2646,7.4371,3.2608,4.7666,2.8803,5.5845,1.2186,5.429,4.0476,0.1131,5.6685,1.8761,2.2509,2.3496,3.2893,2.8473,2.3687,1.2742,0.3172,0.0001,5.7024,4.6855,2.104,2.866,5.1867,3.1982,5.3024,0.7003,5.6322,0.3997,3.3835,3.0967,3.8067,2.0598,1.0307,2.379,0.282,0.0722,1.9781,1.0636,1.2933,2.555,1.6882,3.8791,3.4336,0.2128,3.8709,4.0127,3.6198,3.0108,4.6801,2.7494,2.0408,4.2626,2.7328,2.1103,1.3083,5.8983,3.4983,2.6882,6.2227,2.2231,4.6968,5.9474,1.2734,4.7921,2.1371,4.7929,2.159,5.7359,4.1299,5.0326,0.1188,1.8255,1.6224,5.5645,1.193,0.3448,0.4822,0.8788,3.9481,3.6053,2.1268,2.6157,1.4146,3.7567,5.2104,1.6365,4.6355,0.4848,1.3254,0.0001,4.4214,3.2843,0.298,5.7794,4.5909,1.7738,0.3866,1.738,2.4232,3.4832,2.1842,1.8907,5.312,0.1605,0.1034,5.098,2.3638,1.9629,4.092,4.5353,0.752,3.3876,3.3865,5.3586,4.7494,1.1398,2.2627,0.4555,0.6421,1.9391,1.3344,0.0154,0.1437,2.0739,6.261,6.2713,5.685,1.8877,2.1146,6.2604,1.0761,3.5729,5.1551,6.0287,5.1736,5.8297,0.3488,1.1354,0.4541,1.2486,5.8118,1.5958,0.434,4.8474,1.9486,5.7206,3.1329,1.0118,1.9157,2.4238,5.5856,0.198,0.0747,6.1034,1.7224,0.8246,3.4212,0.03,3.5785,3.2935,3.68,0.2507,2.2234,2.1765,5.8361,1.7401,3.3901,0.8604,5.8711,0.0044,2.7086,0.5688,0.0002,5.0089,3.4626,0.2981,5.1035,0.0202,2.4148,3.3198,5.3223,1.5025,0.8781,2.4661,3.0191,2.8658,1.2427,1.4317,2.5611,1.2411,1.5602,1.445,5.1372,0.6658,0.6896,0.476,0.2938,0.039,1.9566]}

The magazine's first issue was published in January 1940 because of the success of its second issue. Its first issue has been reprinted numerous times in several different volumes: one of America's most recent, The Second American Century, was written in 1942 before his first book was published in 1943.\n\n\u2014 The second edition, published in 1945, was the first American-language edition in four years. The first version was reprinted in 1963. (For more details on the first edition, see Howard and Stump's A Great New Deal, with an accompanying A.D. No. 14, pp. 637-62, and the second edition, published in 1961, pp. 630-13, and the third edition, published in 1964, pp. 1325-47)\n\nI have never found this book to have been taken seriously as a magazine published by an American company, particularly by a company based in the Midwest. This book is considered to have been given from the perspective of the company's main operations.\n\nWe do not have any further information regarding the fact that the first edition of the first American-language edition which was written in 1943 was only available in Europe.\n\nThe \"America's Great Deal\" was not an American business. That is, it was a business conducted by a foreign national company. It was never established as such, and nothing was done about it until the fall of World War II, and it died in 1949 without any effect from further publication. Thus it is quite plain that the first edition was produced by a American company. I should ask myself whether my own knowledge of such circumstances in the 1940s was sufficient to justify me finding it not such, where any such facts are to be believed.","token_len":394,"entropy":[5.5838,5.8614,3.3428,0.0104,6.1002,3.2801,11.7112,4.8317,9.4084,1.9163,3.2899,1.3422,2.3065,1.4284,6.9645,2.3416,0.0429,1.1197,9.2005,7.5168,2.0999,0.8366,3.8977,5.6432,9.5438,7.8243,5.2559,1.4805,8.342,12.6632,5.5434,0.3673,2.6951,1.2768,4.9614,4.8055,1.2135,2.7153,3.6568,2.5843,0.4059,0.451,2.5152,4.7463,1.9154,4.3976,1.6509,1.2051,1.1341,0.4011,3.9312,4.7502,8.2781,1.3584,1.2711,3.4242,0.043,2.8186,4.3423,0.4683,0.7458,5.4193,1.8712,0.6121,6.0281,1.1475,1.3574,4.329,0.0027,2.064,4.1,2.7995,4.951,5.1841,4.0511,2.2964,6.8385,0.0411,1.362,5.1832,1.8701,1.9345,6.0537,2.7529,2.6205,0.5239,0.8483,4.287,0.8715,3.1343,6.616,5.4908,3.6189,3.0745,0.8221,0.3007,2.6279,2.7454,0.4772,1.5956,0.0006,6.3689,3.4822,5.6103,2.0618,2.7116,1.9146,0.3958,3.0943,0.2501,1.0876,2.1213,0.6844,2.8934,3.5908,2.161,2.0869,3.2751,4.488,1.2508,0.5854,1.7699,1.4294,5.0909,1.1007,3.0049,0.75,4.4251,1.776,4.3787,4.5415,1.8347,2.7243,1.0859,0.8955,2.4327,0.3565,0.4868,0.2662,7.3503,5.2322,5.8852,4.3554,0.939,5.3714,5.5604,3.492,4.5868,1.0744,5.6435,2.7522,4.2694,5.6005,3.5655,3.3571,0.0632,4.8095,0.0645,4.6882,1.2511,3.2356,0.019,3.8,4.7183,0.2625,3.9432,2.5655,1.7443,2.4718,2.3511,0.2469,0.2833,0.8656,0.1124,4.5718,0.1022,1.1217,0.0009,5.6059,0.0211,4.7183,0.4961,1.2767,0.6861,0.4411,0.1977,0.0643,0.1269,0.0895,2.4596,0.0429,0.0565,0.0009,3.4671,4.3765,0.0077,4.2666,3.7925,0.4367,0.0002,5.7682,2.3433,3.8734,3.9574,2.9875,2.2379,1.5848,2.7765,1.1034,5.4865,0.6741,2.066,0.6822,5.7513,6.1161,1.0121,3.0986,0.8054,3.1749,1.6797,4.9927,2.1573,1.3016,1.9029,3.6401,0.165,1.7038,5.3373,0.5604,3.7556,1.9924,1.493,4.7464,1.5743,1.3333,0.3016,4.988,6.2649,1.1903,2.4242,0.037,1.9846,3.3159,1.4599,5.4092,4.2743,1.8599,1.4493,0.0002,5.4801,2.9788,0.4067,2.0096,1.2597,4.522,0.7257,3.1801,0.8063,4.7933,0.1263,1.4229,2.3978,0.5075,1.0364,1.8128,2.3165,0.7717,1.3236,0.021,0.2567,6.3502,0.9499,4.6171,0.6924,1.6292,0.5903,4.3622,2.3208,0.6776,5.0137,0.8264,1.0928,0.0002,2.18,5.4787,6.198,1.151,3.5327,1.9614,0.2148,2.3998,2.7983,3.3876,0.7507,4.8853,1.9564,5.3638,1.0026,1.2649,0.8258,0.2374,2.244,2.6032,4.8369,0.8478,1.4351,3.5022,3.919,3.403,1.1435,2.3421,0.5982,4.8589,5.0548,1.9899,1.0652,2.2269,0.9261,5.6137,1.799,1.5064,1.7357,0.1022,1.2628,1.7068,4.6632,0.0121,2.6044,0.0017,0.0381,1.8149,3.593,1.8883,5.7148,1.8996,4.5506,4.3188,1.0508,5.2035,4.241,5.6409,4.0465,0.3516,5.7718,2.9345,1.1371,4.4548,5.8433,0.1577,0.9667,1.6665,1.1826,1.443,4.667,1.2238,0.9216,4.9281,0.273,1.4179,4.9718,4.727,4.9632,2.7883,1.8085,4.6491,3.0625,2.4405,0.4513,4.3929,6.35,4.654,1.0854,4.2376,0.1723,2.3239,2.7333,0.2258,3.1225,4.4426,5.7274,1.1372,3.1689,5.8043,3.6088,6.2646,5.1935,2.1932,2.4431,2.0037,2.9113,0.0563,3.6763,0.3408]}

The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted 90 minutes. The third session was held after midnight, when the race was to end. The final session of the race had to be cancelled with half-day scheduling because of race schedule concerns.\nAncari Racing's head of operations, Andy Schm\u00fcller, expressed regret over the race being postponed.\n\"The weekend is a challenging race. The event is a very high-risk course and you need to take extra care to ensure the safety of spectators, the safety of drivers and the safety of all people who were present at the race,\" he said on Monday. It was announced on Monday, with a deadline date yet to be determined for Friday or Saturday.\nWith race day still more than two days away, it is important to remember that this was an international event, which included 24 races across Europe, and the races were not conducted under any specific, standardized conditions. The following are the procedures for practice sessions :\n\"Every driver at all times must sign a pre-registered registration with any number of teams. A team registration is not issued until the race is over and after the race has been completed (i.e. on the next day). The track registration is subject to further rules which will impact on the success of the race.\nRace teams must ensure their registration is properly identified without any further risk to the race winner or runners due to the risk of collision on the course.\"\nThe FIA then decided that any further changes in the race will not apply. The two previous rules were about keeping spectators in line for the lap before the final lap, and about using the finishing line for final lap events after their respective time-spans have been established. One of the first rules in the FIA's rule book established that each team would receive the same rights to the final lap before each lap.","token_len":395,"entropy":[9.1196,1.4761,2.5898,1.8766,4.823,1.1719,8.1634,7.5685,6.8174,3.6443,3.4553,3.2361,1.981,0.9422,3.233,1.148,0.4553,0.358,0.6569,2.4527,6.4715,4.3252,4.7124,5.5463,0.2956,5.7188,2.8669,4.6464,0.1486,0.8697,2.3779,4.0148,0.7512,1.699,1.0273,3.8009,4.54,1.636,3.1331,0.8787,1.3015,0.8972,3.9843,2.5262,0.5631,2.4894,2.7821,0.7074,2.8351,0.2407,1.2141,4.3297,1.0108,0.3957,4.156,5.3173,6.012,1.7879,4.1597,5.7602,3.3579,0.5946,3.574,3.4222,3.8507,0.2246,0.4034,18.0193,5.7202,6.1108,4.1874,2.7663,5.4891,0.5468,2.465,0.9387,5.2817,4.9233,3.8694,5.9179,0.0365,0.1134,5.626,3.8014,1.8494,0.3165,2.754,4.0543,1.9878,1.0011,0.788,0.2133,2.0299,4.559,2.3966,2.0556,4.8989,2.3969,2.2068,2.1456,5.3057,1.4723,2.6344,2.7682,3.9537,1.5819,2.3833,6.2494,1.2351,4.8715,2.1337,0.344,2.9773,4.3334,1.246,1.2207,1.2477,2.1529,0.4669,0.148,3.4566,2.4217,2.5629,1.8662,0.0367,2.1239,0.5089,0.6907,0.2761,0.0266,2.7746,4.0391,3.7191,4.8127,3.4195,1.7813,0.1115,0.9145,0.332,0.9568,0.149,3.8578,2.7169,0.1625,6.9003,1.2163,4.6149,1.6248,1.2413,4.0067,3.8263,2.8632,3.3883,7.0837,6.4648,0.0067,0.0241,1.4215,4.5283,4.0808,5.8483,0.1236,0.5271,0.3407,5.2297,4.2212,1.9293,3.5238,5.0273,0.0944,1.1894,3.0385,0.0946,0.161,2.839,1.4351,2.9888,0.4332,2.1805,0.3652,3.2849,3.0783,2.3756,4.6363,1.1361,1.4499,2.5231,4.0685,5.0452,2.1417,2.3976,1.6875,1.0743,2.2161,2.4013,4.3285,1.12,2.271,4.4566,3.1217,2.8733,2.319,4.6878,4.8414,1.965,0.1658,2.1263,5.4255,1.7024,0.9782,5.5173,1.4753,4.8662,0.4011,7.4045,0.5102,4.0812,4.9694,2.1926,4.5846,2.9735,1.4927,1.912,3.8282,0.7449,4.3843,0.1142,2.7776,3.2649,2.981,5.6837,4.73,0.3121,3.7755,1.8154,3.5526,2.9814,4.522,1.3633,2.1684,5.1231,1.856,1.1168,2.4629,1.0803,0.9069,1.5576,4.1058,0.6919,0.8309,1.7747,1.8819,1.3857,4.9032,3.1804,0.0019,0.0015,1.1193,3.5399,1.0913,4.648,0.5692,1.3151,1.8519,6.3656,5.0482,1.444,4.745,0.0058,5.8262,4.3861,4.0018,2.3902,5.3234,3.1226,0.6361,5.6793,0.1861,0.2988,0.3307,0.8404,2.4957,4.8288,4.3557,1.0453,3.6455,3.6195,2.8896,1.0198,3.6923,5.4696,6.9918,2.5007,3.3698,3.8901,0.7542,0.9445,1.4787,5.4627,1.837,6.378,6.0352,0.0022,1.7386,3.0479,0.293,4.2772,3.9112,0.4487,1.6931,2.0284,0.2043,1.8958,3.13,5.405,3.4597,1.5983,4.6421,4.573,3.3229,2.5493,0.863,1.5721,3.5739,1.8492,5.1094,1.5469,1.9988,4.9895,4.4224,4.2733,2.4842,5.4804,5.0148,4.0738,2.4783,1.9635,2.5226,0.9062,6.1872,4.1089,0.5682,3.1214,0.7879,1.4405,1.1635,1.7222,4.1413,1.8681,5.4061,1.4349,2.2907,4.9019,1.2141,3.9161,4.8485,6.0231,4.2999,3.7131,3.9265,5.7727,1.3723,1.2931,0.813,3.4937,0.1575,5.7824,0.7833,0.3332,3.7098,1.5829,3.2734,0.661,1.8428,0.8587,2.2636,0.7621,6.4367,0.9905,4.3171,1.4229,2.3667,4.9644,3.2019,1.714,5.4874,0.9683,1.6771,1.9781,0.2691,4.2591,3.0989,1.8054,1.1605]}
{"id":2161,"ended":true,"length":382,"gen_text":"Perry's undercover identity as a pet leads to characters throughout the series to deem him as a `` mindless domestic pet `` that `` doesn 't do much ``. This definition of the word'mummy' in the comic illustrates just how much these characters view the concept of a person as a person: for example, Robin's ''dramatic'' appearance in The Amazing Spider-Man, but other characters have also expressed an interest in him during times of war or for emotional distress. This comic is designed to show a strong and sympathetic portrayal of Robin as a dog and to add to the characters belief that Robin is the loving one that will always love her, and who can truly love anyone. While one character on the show (who is never actually a pet) was the pet of a wealthy man or a rich woman, there's a large group of characters who are the same people who believe that some kind of entity (such as a billionaire, criminal, or a child molester) can be seen as part and parcel of someone's psyche and the actions of a person, so some of the characters see Robin as part of them, or even in any way as part of them. These characters are not necessarily just a few who are convinced that Robin is a pet (we can see from the fact that the character's adoptive parents often feel that this is their most obvious way of having them feel that Robin is a pet), but their main characters.\n\n\nThere are a lot of instances where characters believe that there could be a ``part two'' to Robin. The two series are also linked through time that can manifest themselves in this same episode. The three most frequently-discussed instances of an actual \"part'' are \"Batman'' by Bruce Wayne (with a ''part'' in his name), \"Robin'' by Robin McGooper (also with ''part'' in his name), and \"Batman: Robin: One Man's Man'' by Robin Snyder.","token_len":395,"entropy":[7.374,2.8092,10.4259,7.3064,3.5226,1.0348,8.9481,8.9927,1.4356,9.842,6.7546,0.524,1.0255,4.4658,9.7397,1.2932,3.189,1.1092,10.5716,16.2396,7.5355,2.9549,4.4153,3.5866,5.1276,5.8812,10.1334,0.8812,3.5257,2.8069,5.7818,3.1728,3.6942,7.0079,2.0734,2.3021,1.7695,11.8916,9.5916,8.1578,5.7904,1.4721,4.2969,5.198,3.9848,0.0778,2.0798,5.3787,0.5581,4.4497,2.0153,3.8963,0.1351,2.1577,5.3258,1.6407,1.3197,3.9238,4.6877,5.4966,0.7647,0.1568,5.8652,2.6771,4.4825,5.4826,4.0506,0.1188,1.5703,3.0665,1.7939,2.6408,5.7459,0.3479,0.0483,0.006,2.3339,4.3516,5.8099,0.7625,3.1535,3.1723,3.9237,2.9319,1.5633,0.0292,2.5885,5.7799,5.2443,0.2807,4.5434,1.4898,4.2281,5.4975,3.0397,0.5784,3.7906,5.1371,2.4804,5.1152,0.1704,3.2366,3.2102,5.2307,3.5653,3.645,2.4463,0.0343,2.0642,2.0935,0.4345,4.7671,2.8036,2.7306,5.5255,1.2826,0.6143,4.6883,5.6395,0.4467,1.5957,0.6047,3.2549,5.6261,4.6726,2.5633,3.99,2.185,2.0351,1.2536,2.3892,1.9295,4.9153,3.1313,3.5751,2.3179,2.8847,0.7891,4.5078,5.8855,2.4637,5.36,0.5631,0.906,4.143,4.3681,1.5345,4.6497,2.9578,1.9618,1.7499,0.9601,4.0726,5.1932,3.7145,0.6493,1.1774,5.1129,1.9211,3.6436,1.8842,3.9456,0.682,0.463,3.2971,3.5409,1.5837,4.2444,3.0094,0.1149,1.1592,0.5787,1.7892,3.9324,3.8675,3.1864,1.21,2.9477,0.6375,6.3026,2.2925,0.0074,5.7415,3.5619,1.7733,0.0048,0.9103,5.6767,2.4407,6.0858,0.5522,0.5821,2.2025,4.3167,1.5172,0.0006,0.0778,2.3315,2.2768,3.4525,0.3528,5.1361,2.8717,0.0146,0.0481,4.1197,0.4765,4.6679,1.8436,4.601,4.8727,0.5206,2.3042,1.2499,2.7584,3.9399,6.13,1.2568,1.0173,0.7826,4.5255,1.349,0.1116,3.8317,0.3018,3.0434,1.8061,2.9425,2.4521,3.8487,6.5574,0.7376,2.1945,0.9165,0.0937,0.3264,0.3804,3.9631,0.4046,1.5551,2.9633,2.5441,4.4646,2.9686,5.17,4.6072,2.0216,5.3301,0.6352,0.5594,0.263,1.3702,1.5422,3.9595,6.0542,3.0461,1.7274,3.6998,0.9126,2.967,0.0375,2.4573,2.4983,2.4809,5.3602,0.4872,3.5429,4.6656,1.4474,3.7446,0.809,3.0091,5.1537,4.2279,3.6575,0.2651,5.5219,3.2706,2.8242,1.8054,1.1069,0.1756,1.3615,0.7148,1.0997,0.2659,5.2656,4.4076,2.781,1.7058,3.8931,0.0007,3.9657,0.5079,2.4618,2.3927,0.0452,4.8049,0.9424,2.2532,3.0205,0.3688,4.1434,4.6409,0.1264,1.1065,4.464,5.1212,6.2772,0.4945,2.9407,1.3162,3.054,2.5721,5.3822,5.9107,2.3259,5.1126,3.6861,3.1159,2.4193,5.4472,3.8732,5.6132,1.5126,0.9223,5.72,6.8091,6.1066,1.1183,2.0286,5.2305,3.855,2.9073,4.5929,4.46,0.0875,2.4015,0.9274,3.9637,4.0125,3.6567,0.2857,3.1866,1.4337,4.7183,5.3678,2.3947,4.9244,4.1908,0.0553,1.8254,4.3883,2.6111,5.2526,1.4656,0.8653,1.7358,1.9197,0.3208,0.454,1.094,1.8702,0.5392,0.0969,0.9001,6.7822,8.8546,6.9681,0.4242,5.0054,1.4268,2.6342,0.1407,0.0932,0.1949,0.0744,0.0179,0.2394,0.1625,0.3579,2.2757,2.7864,2.3065,3.2935,5.4055,2.3593,0.8727,3.8687,0.8788,0.1171,1.2571,5.2752,1.0524]}

The Bulldogs were in the lead thanks in part to a great turnover on 3rd and 11 by No. 8 quarterback Jake Kelly.","token_len":395,"entropy":[1.9437,7.8832,0.1842,0.2816,7.7662,2.7489,4.1571,0.0014,4.0536,0.776,4.0154,2.1581,2.0394,4.408,6.8002,13.7049,5.0131,10.9064,7.2772,6.6406,0.0856,0.6696,5.718,3.9157,1.8968,1.3605,7.5575,4.3737,1.2661,5.1578,1.6072,0.0007,6.978,3.4453,0.9177,0.0006,4.4406,0.7767,3.0631,0.4188,0.9172,4.0937,2.1293,1.1292,0.8808,1.8911,0.0009,3.6606,1.9664,1.2237,0.0003,1.8916,0.5641,4.2655,2.3811,2.4396,4.5054,3.8717,4.8876,4.885,4.7633,0.6458,3.1382,3.9424,3.8845,4.0441,0.9694,3.2667,3.6586,0.0927,2.3927,1.6645,4.5304,2.2688,3.4161,3.7845,0.8559,0.4921,2.2903,3.9059,5.1794,1.3869,4.175,2.8441,4.0131,3.875,1.6334,4.5211,1.1559,1.8779,5.1464,1.4435,2.0034,2.0303,5.4328,2.6111,5.0808,0.551,0.8386,0.0107,0.2507,0.7225,0.0002,4.7175,3.9844,0.3465,1.1927,3.0244,0.7881,0.0011,2.7876,0.3358,1.8842,6.6314,1.3845,3.4401,2.8308,1.9951,1.1033,0.718,2.5749,0.0012,2.1449,1.3371,1.8954,0.3811,2.1937,4.6169,0.0378,3.7083,5.5949,0.3561,5.4621,1.5943,2.6287,1.2092,4.2415,0.5658,0.0162,0.0025,7.8294,3.1813,6.5346,0.1144,3.2287,2.4583,2.4601,0.5836,0.8592,0.0002,5.7908,5.1901,6.4339,0.3597,1.2834,2.6836,3.5461,0.0023,4.5565,4.2607,1.0469,0.6408,2.295,4.6463,0.0007,0.9252,2.548,0.9276,0.8922,3.1914,2.1425,5.5874,0.1158,3.0426,4.7627,3.7411,3.2179,0.6489,4.0116,0.6657,3.5563,3.1055,2.4224,4.1036,2.5366,2.1778,3.4541,5.9484,1.4161,2.3477,0.7503,2.7454,0.0023,1.5316,3.0428,3.7991,1.8596,0.9258,0.1568,0.5625,0.3735,3.5293,0.7962,6.3904,3.1174,0.2258,5.718,0.781,0.6492,0.1133,1.0121,0.5164,0.0002,2.2807,0.0003,3.1794,4.6229,1.706,0.2195,0.6437,6.2054,0.0511,3.3991,5.0482,4.0559,1.9234,2.0767,3.957,0.2838,3.3514,0.0623,0.4579,1.2281,2.7222,2.0749,5.6363,2.7706,2.8206,2.3217,2.0815,1.6087,2.5403,5.2906,4.0092,2.0425,4.171,0.3115,0.7209,1.4185,3.6056,5.2463,0.0365,0.2031,5.5928,4.91,2.527,0.0785,1.1717,4.337,2.5638,0.3205,2.6227,0.7095,3.0234,0.851,5.2659,3.7293,3.0616,0.7257,0.3483,4.2212,3.1486,0.1212,2.638,0.0066,0.1661,4.42,0.1595,4.9676,0.0,1.0881,0.9497,0.0274,3.2226,3.3892,2.688,4.0016,0.0003,0.3942,3.8815,0.0014,2.5045,0.751,5.024,0.0001,1.27,0.0267,2.863,2.9392,0.0016,2.5873,0.0747,4.8847,0.6443,2.5331,0.2996,0.0032,2.179,0.0441,2.2736,0.6977,4.3908,2.1977,0.552,0.0042,3.6578,0.0522,1.9559,1.0031,0.9013,3.2584,0.1443,0.2551,0.0002,4.8426,1.3656,1.3951,4.145,1.3471,0.4159,4.4277,3.646,2.4745,6.0471,1.9158,0.8993,0.3323,3.4991,0.002,4.3019,3.8267,2.4708,3.2238,1.8271,2.598,2.396,1.9982,0.859,5.5557,3.915,1.1999,4.2164,5.4306,0.0937,4.0648,2.1597,3.5784,6.3188,1.5758,2.1501,5.6714,1.734,2.3817,3.999,2.3522,8.0045,2.7111,0.8589,1.8913,1.8207,1.8556,4.3568,1.2423,2.9835,4.9318,2.6559,1.0034,0.0075,1.4837,4.2942,6.0071,3.3916,3.6823,0.0547,0.758,3.3239,1.5816,5.6362,0.0022,3.1322,3.8117,3.4768,4.1479,1.1677]}
{"id":69,"ended":false,"length":372,"gen_text":"While performing shows with The Second City in 1997, Fey submitted several scripts to NBC's variety show Saturday Night Live ( SNL ), at the request of its head writer Adam McKay. NBC refused to provide its own scripts to those producers, who had been invited to speak because of budgetary restraints. NBC also did not allow any specific scripts provided for the show's production, nor did NBC give any particular scripts to the show's main cast. According to interviews with executives after the shows aired, during the early days of the series, Fey's producer, Jon Favreau, and producer-producer-director Brett Ratner were concerned about the show's potential use of live-action footage. \"We've never seen anything like it,\" Fox producer Greg Berlanti told me. Berlanti, who is a Fox contributor, asked what \"how'd your guys do it?\" At one point, Favreau told Berlanti, \"Just throw that in your mouth, and you won't find anyone who won't say there's something.\" Berlanti agreed, but denied any plans to use the series live. \"I've given them the information I know,\" Berlanti told me. When Berlanti asked who had told him of the series' use of live-action footage, Favreau declined to answer, instead asking Berlanti: \"How will your guys do it?\" Berlanti replied that the show \"is really just an expression of love, and we had always done that,\" and that the crew had planned on doing so because it was \"cool as hell.\" Even after three seasons of the series, it appeared in limited-run and DVD material, as the series was described as offering \"an insight into the creative processes of the characters on our show, as well as the emotional and interpersonal interactions between the characters, such as their emotional expressions, how they react when something's pointed at them, where they go, or what they think.\"","token_len":395,"entropy":[8.9972,8.3272,3.2417,5.211,8.4416,2.4818,3.3301,7.1419,0.5371,9.3767,9.3695,4.5067,4.5657,1.5097,5.219,3.7092,8.2725,0.827,7.3068,0.0188,0.0117,3.4384,11.4486,0.002,2.3316,6.5936,2.4322,1.823,0.0093,4.3476,4.8727,1.84,6.794,3.3095,0.597,4.3072,4.1084,0.551,4.0036,4.2339,2.1206,1.9794,1.8722,5.4178,4.3751,0.919,3.5874,2.9356,2.4157,4.244,0.5338,5.1978,7.6169,1.0985,6.2239,3.793,0.6078,3.417,2.9299,3.3916,0.0353,3.2541,3.0289,5.1916,1.5209,7.1995,3.1653,1.6868,1.1906,2.653,2.9295,1.7878,3.2486,0.6241,2.9302,3.4036,1.5256,4.7198,2.6789,0.5299,1.8326,2.1402,0.0923,5.5954,1.31,0.8662,4.9697,0.0011,5.6614,0.4088,4.253,6.2032,0.3821,5.0772,2.0728,0.2059,6.0657,0.8019,3.6426,2.1505,0.1604,0.6529,2.7107,0.2852,1.7256,2.5133,4.6131,1.6792,5.0399,3.2012,0.0,0.1085,3.4068,1.7461,3.9972,1.1135,0.0013,3.3575,2.1026,5.233,1.5961,0.0001,2.0241,3.44,1.199,1.1768,2.4711,0.149,2.4464,5.3623,0.6127,4.8037,0.7908,0.0482,2.4546,1.2538,2.0807,1.8783,3.8519,2.5565,1.1616,1.9303,0.383,0.7088,0.7748,6.4312,3.6156,4.8325,2.1328,0.0024,0.0008,0.7358,3.1915,0.5816,4.7257,0.0011,0.0032,2.242,0.4542,2.682,2.7155,4.8485,3.7082,0.4462,5.7585,4.2331,3.9437,5.1131,5.3628,5.4046,3.1314,2.2543,1.1682,1.2032,5.2231,1.5246,0.0279,0.398,2.5757,0.0019,2.0007,1.5856,0.002,0.004,0.8248,0.1565,4.56,5.1174,3.9958,1.5717,4.0067,3.3943,2.1535,1.4361,2.0508,4.2635,0.0149,4.1817,3.0833,1.6958,3.3836,0.0049,1.6724,6.3732,0.497,1.8561,5.7536,2.6899,0.0013,0.0037,4.2523,1.1758,1.679,5.2329,3.0894,3.6219,0.3657,1.0152,2.216,4.97,2.9681,0.7205,1.456,1.401,2.9179,6.2466,2.2052,2.2227,4.8075,1.8179,3.2815,1.7489,0.7983,0.0009,0.0037,0.7389,0.1518,0.1865,4.2289,1.686,0.0022,0.0095,2.0751,4.7069,3.0531,4.2024,0.5499,2.991,0.5444,4.3061,1.0008,0.6427,0.3292,0.342,0.465,0.0056,0.1836,0.1882,1.9097,0.0024,3.9957,0.3068,1.9669,1.4386,3.3708,3.0455,1.412,0.0024,0.0121,3.6157,0.0704,2.9785,6.2869,3.47,0.2706,0.5201,0.2408,0.2648,1.5508,0.0012,0.0072,2.2791,1.4229,2.1729,1.4025,2.6399,1.9723,4.6015,3.1628,3.0819,4.3385,0.1023,3.905,1.9976,1.2058,2.1658,5.3686,5.2704,2.9497,1.4298,3.3946,1.0929,0.6333,1.9018,5.729,1.96,5.2872,2.5599,2.8489,2.8704,4.1574,2.0162,0.864,1.1069,5.1294,5.9583,0.5748,0.33,5.7755,1.7811,5.7745,1.0982,1.0657,1.9591,1.4876,0.3164,3.4813,4.5211,2.85,3.8058,4.7456,0.4857,4.5032,4.4967,5.6567,1.1114,3.4887,3.3312,2.5058,1.6398,5.2428,1.9093,7.1789,0.5941,3.2328,5.4168,0.1303,0.956,4.3287,3.5077,0.8557,1.5902,4.1897,3.5998,5.0124,0.5069,2.2945,2.8502,0.1403,0.0023,1.5802,5.2227,1.6208,4.7667,3.581,1.436,0.9521,0.5382,2.8894,4.7708,0.3207,3.4725,3.9962,5.964,1.6029,4.7129,0.5393,2.5509,2.84,4.2501,2.5443,5.5314,1.8587,0.1076,0.542,4.9882,0.3034,2.8018,1.3892,2.7673,1.5322,0.8138,2.1734,1.6249]}

It is very important that you bring your resume and\/or the application to the meeting you are attending, as this will help keep your potential at UH a little more complete.\n\nThe community center website links to additional resources:\n\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ur.edu\/events","token_len":396,"entropy":[10.3823,0.6153,2.6012,6.6487,0.1225,4.4058,0.1872,10.2748,6.6873,7.1312,9.7679,14.3598,8.7005,4.3265,5.6662,6.6521,0.0542,1.6605,10.1483,0.8218,6.8895,6.5508,0.7755,3.2644,2.2295,4.0023,0.4207,8.123,5.8494,8.1617,8.9953,7.1935,9.8635,6.9958,3.4821,6.0574,3.3303,2.063,2.8958,2.4511,3.6452,1.2644,4.8648,3.1221,6.2321,4.8286,0.0038,2.9155,2.2369,2.6053,2.0001,0.004,1.9366,4.0442,3.1672,1.4054,4.2764,0.7399,1.96,4.8827,1.9496,1.8381,6.2508,0.2328,0.4935,4.2824,2.8976,1.4554,2.2654,0.0029,3.6072,3.6749,1.598,4.3504,3.4191,3.002,0.0106,1.0358,5.0588,5.9878,0.9323,0.2957,0.7453,0.451,0.0047,6.5813,0.9484,2.4142,1.7343,1.3232,0.0174,4.0529,3.6989,2.2972,4.5012,3.3922,2.6208,1.0122,3.4367,0.7759,3.792,0.7496,5.0449,1.6645,5.6148,5.8354,0.409,1.5114,0.1692,5.6967,1.4852,4.0404,0.5599,2.5063,1.0813,0.2468,2.4478,4.4003,2.5825,0.7669,0.0068,5.5631,2.4234,1.7252,0.7681,2.3309,1.5244,1.0626,0.0258,2.7199,4.5433,1.8072,3.9089,1.3476,1.1457,0.0714,3.2209,2.5885,2.9055,0.6798,4.5619,0.5477,3.1637,1.2922,0.6849,0.0002,4.8176,4.8728,0.6588,1.7166,4.3378,3.1404,2.4743,3.497,3.6341,1.6025,0.2956,4.9346,1.4447,2.6098,3.3999,1.7327,1.3977,2.2685,4.1694,5.6663,2.4885,2.7724,2.4263,0.0732,2.0143,1.2265,0.5379,0.5123,2.0818,0.3476,0.518,3.359,2.4353,0.2716,3.0723,4.1715,5.792,4.0351,1.2015,0.4354,3.6896,2.3139,3.8727,0.4297,2.8823,4.5526,2.8782,1.967,1.5795,2.7773,0.1534,1.7934,4.9305,4.5368,3.8012,0.7348,4.7985,1.4571,2.9437,0.2041,5.3274,3.3928,1.6905,3.7206,0.3462,1.0288,0.0002,3.3811,4.0078,0.5192,0.4674,0.0237,4.9317,1.9467,2.4574,4.1808,1.9039,2.2876,0.0127,1.5718,3.6911,1.1681,3.6664,4.3916,5.6532,1.8964,0.2334,3.0927,2.9924,2.7511,2.3092,3.7275,0.2399,0.4627,1.6117,4.9957,5.9731,2.8249,5.5458,0.3435,1.6144,2.3224,2.2648,4.2805,1.0823,0.4226,6.0078,2.5263,0.719,0.5623,1.7961,3.2989,4.7882,0.0179,0.1761,0.0259,4.1897,1.4176,1.6314,0.4883,5.7213,6.0729,5.3807,3.5309,5.5527,2.6004,6.1142,0.5574,6.7051,0.951,0.4334,3.5598,1.9524,2.2097,3.6095,1.2451,3.8705,0.4349,0.1241,0.8096,0.0993,0.4225,1.5682,3.2731,1.7802,0.0492,1.2818,3.2219,1.9622,5.468,2.1926,1.7287,5.0926,0.4869,0.4621,3.6631,0.49,6.0875,2.6976,3.5986,6.4651,3.9897,0.5588,5.6391,3.4568,2.9675,0.2702,1.7748,1.6449,3.4737,5.6179,2.2118,5.1774,0.8805,2.3862,1.1845,2.6597,1.0901,0.8249,1.6941,2.0579,1.6145,3.1701,4.4684,5.2508,4.531,5.6246,1.8115,3.841,0.6297,0.2871,5.7499,0.2629,4.7371,0.193,0.7858,2.9053,4.3907,1.5387,5.9978,1.006,3.4954,0.0009,4.2601,5.2858,2.0613,1.2695,2.6547,5.2858,0.7606,1.1866,1.8459,1.6556,2.1352,1.6831,0.8983,5.0122,1.7486,5.4612,5.4676,5.3052,0.6801,4.5381,2.3718,0.9677,4.5749,0.3492,0.5286,0.0002,2.31,3.9054,0.8876,6.4257,6.1009,0.7047,4.997,1.3117,4.1261,3.744,0.0003,2.5912,0.0003,0.8424,0.0009,5.183,2.5592,0.4687,0.0318,4.9584]}
{"id":1401,"ended":false,"length":381,"gen_text":"Omaha was completely devoid of trails leading up to early 1989. That year the city began developing trails, and since then the city of Omaha has developed approximately 67 miles ( 108 km ) of trails in that time period. The major differences between these two cities are how these trails intersect and how they form from a straight roadway across the city.\nAn interesting finding about Omaha's new trails is the lack of trail designations. In most of the history of Omaha trails, not one is designated as a public thoroughfare, and most designated trails have at least one small loop. This is interesting because the city already created some 1.5 miles of paved paths (for people who can't see) and trails with very little traffic flow (with only a few people exiting). A few of these trails may have long looped paths with long grassy paths that can be a great way to keep track of some of the less popular routes around. There are really no great trails around and none that can be called public, so there is really no reason to assume that all these trails will be maintained during the next 14 years.\nMany more public trails are in the works in this county, so for many of the new trails, like the one today, it is important that they are clearly marked. New trails are built for specific circumstances, such as trails that have been designated public because they are dangerous to vehicles or other pedestrians, and to trails that are unsafe to the public. As for the history of those trail designs, the city of Elkhorn has given a public history lesson as well, and recently the city of Elkhorn has named two different trails, and one that would make an excellent public trail if it could, and a trail the city of Elkhorn would still build. So this is certainly a time at the beginning when the city of Omaha should consider what trails should be built and that if they do, then why not build a trail for them?","token_len":396,"entropy":[6.9041,4.2764,4.9311,6.8875,6.1553,0.0074,11.2467,5.885,2.0988,0.0845,9.1537,9.2398,0.9422,4.6628,3.1121,3.2348,3.8349,3.4005,4.794,3.3,2.3939,2.1801,5.6093,0.4488,1.7592,1.4782,3.6628,3.78,0.2266,2.6946,6.7272,7.1925,0.8426,4.674,13.2651,0.1939,2.6841,0.0289,0.2879,2.7751,5.0011,1.255,1.0429,0.297,2.1521,5.7986,5.0335,0.5946,2.7009,1.4015,1.1685,0.7049,5.9041,4.9433,0.1437,4.2985,1.2288,0.5306,0.7576,4.3487,5.2503,2.881,4.9279,6.1401,5.7698,1.0252,1.2342,0.7339,1.2246,7.6991,2.8627,4.8103,1.9509,2.5611,1.6432,5.6927,0.6375,0.4604,1.9655,3.8788,0.0082,3.4317,4.7646,1.9681,1.03,2.5905,3.4446,1.3296,0.3277,5.0826,0.0327,1.7169,3.9224,1.2452,5.4142,1.2646,4.2764,1.6285,1.2231,0.7374,3.3648,5.2546,0.0023,1.695,1.4931,3.7104,6.0031,0.42,2.371,4.8114,0.0916,0.3694,5.8067,3.5056,1.6782,2.3188,1.74,5.4641,0.5488,2.1328,2.0843,5.7341,5.043,3.4164,5.9942,1.6783,0.9801,0.2091,0.9488,2.9331,4.2497,3.6933,5.3085,5.1894,1.6367,4.0945,0.397,2.5708,3.3816,2.368,3.1678,3.3137,4.3313,1.385,3.5692,4.0211,2.8989,5.0694,3.4993,1.1766,0.5351,4.0102,5.4726,2.6622,4.745,2.1468,1.8664,0.7498,0.6959,4.5711,1.2896,5.2286,4.2693,1.5735,2.9515,3.4591,3.9631,4.6622,1.2749,2.9094,2.116,3.6461,0.5967,5.0231,2.8872,1.241,0.1278,5.1798,3.4752,0.0425,5.812,0.8986,0.1772,5.3717,2.8168,3.2593,4.8284,2.5035,4.0695,0.755,6.2733,1.9753,5.6063,1.9249,1.9212,4.4178,4.8853,1.1058,3.1586,0.9061,3.0964,2.3917,3.3934,1.7154,2.5831,1.0064,3.3714,0.3852,1.2489,0.4115,5.0195,0.4281,3.0309,2.5596,0.5464,2.1207,0.8025,4.2866,6.0086,0.6396,1.1896,6.1536,0.1989,0.2988,0.6675,4.5669,5.0523,4.3242,0.7912,1.7353,2.8386,0.7578,0.1777,2.8038,3.9558,4.8127,1.3075,2.5504,4.9907,4.6849,1.1826,1.7657,3.3175,0.4262,1.5267,6.0895,0.9725,3.0592,5.8794,0.5297,1.8777,1.3186,2.0857,2.1916,1.3168,1.4841,5.6395,0.5847,1.3555,6.0669,0.4476,1.5193,4.3959,3.5663,3.8726,5.5363,0.8488,2.0525,0.0051,5.9019,0.8775,2.3565,1.7124,2.6003,3.1655,3.8432,1.0014,1.2525,5.3511,1.6163,5.0682,1.3864,3.9453,2.0479,1.5736,1.5652,4.0971,4.6799,0.3286,0.8176,5.4749,0.903,3.8855,0.429,0.7539,4.4035,2.9633,1.1847,5.5173,0.2543,3.9345,3.7347,0.8359,0.2482,2.1229,1.3387,1.2474,8.5132,1.9161,1.9661,1.5381,5.702,2.8963,4.5389,2.2409,2.9954,4.6156,0.9591,1.5799,1.7453,5.7139,2.3341,0.7136,1.2105,2.4955,0.0129,0.0114,1.5091,5.5337,3.499,5.2211,0.8971,2.0452,4.0217,2.7678,2.8586,4.6583,3.5561,3.278,0.9007,2.0273,0.9934,5.9,1.0629,3.0313,4.5423,1.3944,3.1988,0.6224,6.524,0.551,1.3074,2.3426,0.0033,0.0061,1.6818,4.4201,4.2077,1.2811,4.8561,4.1543,1.0412,5.1288,0.9204,5.6149,6.8082,2.6036,3.911,2.5457,1.5359,0.3971,0.5441,0.3815,2.0135,2.2955,4.296,1.5872,2.3225,0.2624,0.9693,2.1313,5.0732,5.3639,0.8524,2.8214,2.2248,3.035,3.793,0.6956,1.903,2.4607,1.0235,2.5293,1.7733,0.7021]}

{"id":1898,"ended":true,"length":384,"gen_text":"Male condoms have a tight ring to form a seal around the penis while female condoms typically have a large stiff ring to keep them from slipping into the body orifice. The Female Health Information Center makes it clear in the pamphlet that those who use these condoms are at great risk because of the risk of other things such as HIV and HIV B.\nAn interesting finding about male condoms: While they are extremely safe, there is a risk that they can be used for STD testing and STD transmission. This report is designed to provide a useful and reliable guide where men are at risk and how they might save the lives of their daughters or grandchildren. The information above will not only make your condoms safer for sexual pleasure but also help you get a better knowledge of the benefits of using these products.\nI know there may be more to male condom use than a simple \"cure\". Although the majority of men believe using these condoms protects against sexually transmitted diseases, it also makes your sperm, eggs and sperm count much higher. As part of our research, however, we have taken a look at the safety of male condoms for reproductive health.\nFeminists have used these contraceptive methods for decades. In 1998, for example, a study published by the National Sexually Transmitted Diseases Surveillance System found that women used these methods at the equivalent of one year of age, 24, which is two years older than the average adult woman. It is thought that this is because these contraceptive drugs don't provide enough health benefits to those who are using the same contraception over and over again. They also provide no health benefit to those who don't use these contraception, either. So it is very probable that the use of the NSPCS contraceptive products reduces, by as much as a third, reproductive health benefits from their use in this case.\nThe Bottom Line:\nThere is no scientific evidence to support the idea that men have a \"right to life\" before they are exposed to sexual activity.","token_len":396,"entropy":[11.9615,3.1033,2.6928,9.1265,3.7404,2.2037,9.2265,2.929,4.4201,1.7579,0.9117,3.6122,5.2324,5.7817,0.1081,6.6911,1.0636,0.6573,5.4782,9.5885,0.3946,1.6549,3.5806,1.8322,0.8526,3.2144,3.6522,0.9844,3.7837,4.2049,7.498,0.3008,2.5713,8.4727,5.9938,4.3544,1.9897,5.2778,2.0014,1.2013,4.4594,2.1155,3.8504,0.4188,5.8931,1.0638,2.0451,3.6229,1.4649,1.7961,3.1716,4.444,0.0058,4.9192,1.5087,1.3139,1.5575,0.3117,5.4069,4.9378,2.7664,0.0011,3.1344,1.9612,4.3504,5.4208,1.9338,0.888,14.0288,4.0459,4.5875,2.136,3.3799,0.3422,4.2611,4.3954,2.1726,1.1513,5.0002,2.4005,0.7588,2.8732,1.0384,1.1133,2.6161,1.4224,0.84,2.0041,1.8312,1.6756,2.3694,5.204,1.1802,2.501,4.8705,2.3913,0.5789,2.9086,6.6345,2.3748,4.8571,0.0935,2.0313,1.678,4.7951,2.4665,4.6682,1.4717,6.9025,3.4656,2.6162,2.861,0.1806,3.024,1.6144,1.7064,4.0022,6.2789,3.7289,0.6011,0.0349,1.0009,5.3738,2.9522,2.9212,0.3513,3.075,2.8454,5.3056,3.9209,2.1606,2.2446,4.1548,2.6279,5.4013,0.541,2.5506,6.5784,2.8638,0.8629,1.0941,1.3398,0.5342,3.6867,2.6318,1.3835,4.3736,0.3897,1.1555,3.8407,0.3449,1.3081,1.6374,2.4666,0.4388,0.6984,4.4579,3.6743,3.1298,4.1319,0.1388,3.9609,1.7218,4.1846,1.7069,0.2773,0.2594,4.3685,2.0856,3.1617,5.0847,0.4386,3.0017,5.129,2.5331,3.6312,0.0255,1.059,4.6626,5.5742,2.1391,1.4036,5.3332,2.3536,1.912,0.004,0.4318,0.6099,2.5841,3.1108,2.6059,4.6374,3.8353,3.8843,0.7829,0.6035,1.4391,3.7176,2.3873,1.5441,0.7673,3.8385,5.5896,0.0009,2.2949,2.1223,1.0265,7.0419,0.0054,0.4096,2.166,3.5859,1.2816,1.6123,0.0532,1.0382,4.2217,0.4933,1.0145,0.2877,3.2324,4.3279,0.7792,1.1654,1.5614,4.721,3.7126,1.6802,2.0703,4.6482,2.597,5.6088,0.9898,1.145,1.9969,1.3678,2.8343,5.8866,0.246,4.2662,0.2407,0.0022,2.5178,1.6837,1.9373,2.4574,0.6574,1.9526,5.7818,0.2724,0.0136,0.0094,0.2224,1.74,0.0412,1.6724,0.1358,3.0229,4.3079,2.8734,1.309,2.5666,3.0996,5.4204,0.2738,3.3435,3.0316,1.0709,0.6126,2.3045,5.045,2.4046,4.7223,1.0255,4.4814,0.5093,2.7406,0.0632,1.0577,1.3606,4.0606,1.8668,0.3966,3.5385,1.2617,4.803,0.2107,1.953,1.9217,0.5069,3.2014,2.5321,6.5826,5.1203,0.0005,4.2851,2.7417,5.9428,0.1769,0.8014,3.8325,0.6028,1.5139,2.5222,3.0371,3.195,5.3584,4.9979,0.3279,0.0195,0.8274,0.2355,5.0376,1.3286,4.3659,1.8214,2.2131,2.2919,0.876,0.979,0.1743,3.4039,0.0009,0.5275,2.2156,3.9274,2.8489,3.9366,0.232,3.8819,2.914,0.6665,3.2972,6.4984,0.0505,2.2376,1.8984,0.0136,3.8001,5.7286,2.4274,4.6802,1.8089,4.3376,5.1091,5.4487,4.3713,3.5952,0.1035,0.0149,3.454,0.8196,0.1167,6.0398,0.1404,1.1441,2.794,3.933,0.0575,4.0548,3.1835,4.7232,0.1306,0.6288,2.2206,4.7682,0.0188,1.5478,1.7846,3.1136,0.935,1.1303,2.1299,0.5022,1.2799,0.7491,0.5692,2.6236,0.0431,2.5138,3.8766,1.7735,3.7233,4.5587,1.5107,4.2998,0.5808,6.0196,0.9927,2.111,2.9827,0.0134,4.3787,1.537,0.9715]}

{"id":4636,"ended":true,"length":379,"gen_text":"This tropical depression formed in the Bay of Campeche on August 26 and moved slowly northwest, moving ashore northeast Mexico on August 29 and into the United States on August 30. As an example, in October, in the Atlantic Ocean, the southern Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico, the northern Caribbean Sea formed in August 26 and moved northeast, and to northwest, while the eastern part of the coast moved northwest. The storm formed in August 29 during landfall on Texas River and moved through Louisiana during landfall on June 20, and on April 10 and 30, southwest of New Orleans, the storm retreated eastward. In North Carolina, the storm moved northeast from the city of Asheville to Charlotte and then to the city of Greensboro for at least 72 hours. In Texas, Hurricane A on August 22 battered Texas waters, releasing more than 40 inches of rain, and forced the evacuation of 10 people, most from the city of Fort Bend. In Texas, Hurricane Harvey also battered Texas waters and led to evacuations of 1,400 residents in Houston, leaving about 700 people homeless, making Hurricane Harvey an especially severe storm for Texas. Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana on March 11 and left at least 300,000 people without power in New Orleans, making Hurricane Katrina an especially severe storm for Texas. Hurricane Sandy made landfall on South Carolina's coast, and devastated the eastern coast of the state for two days. Hurricane Matthew became the first major hurricane in 2017 to make landfall on the western coast of the U.S., and then on the eastern coast of Florida on March 26. In June, the Florida Keys became the worst disaster that affected Florida, with widespread winds and heavy rain, and saw more damage than any hurricane in 2017. Hurricane Frances, then caused by the Red Sea, made landfall, and in Georgia and New Mexico, with extreme flooding and landslides, made landfall in the Georgia-Nebraska border region of Georgia on March 28, where it flooded 1.3 million residents.","token_len":396,"entropy":[11.5381,4.2227,6.6849,1.6277,1.1738,7.3252,0.2116,6.5242,0.5932,0.0454,3.3234,3.8572,3.5326,3.7495,4.6266,4.0165,5.2892,3.6493,3.7983,8.1008,7.1145,11.8921,2.6656,1.5762,1.7769,2.3529,4.8156,0.7403,3.5045,0.0048,0.5849,2.0285,0.316,0.283,4.4656,5.2358,3.0094,0.5126,2.5359,3.7688,1.8651,3.9399,1.1847,5.1137,0.8267,0.3974,0.9433,5.2771,4.4434,1.5652,1.3452,0.4581,0.6817,1.7153,0.1245,0.0684,0.3538,0.7764,4.2286,2.2552,0.3742,2.0837,1.8209,4.8998,4.5097,0.9486,0.2768,1.9596,2.0377,2.8083,5.1373,4.8626,0.6641,5.5885,0.5769,2.5141,3.9551,0.1262,0.2633,4.9361,1.473,2.0386,0.915,1.8099,4.1612,4.199,1.1392,3.3593,1.9559,5.0395,6.2876,1.4276,5.1045,6.2634,3.1468,1.2325,4.4607,4.6685,5.2902,0.6945,0.2327,5.0487,3.1837,1.7637,1.9532,3.5196,4.6648,3.4552,2.5699,6.373,0.9838,5.6213,0.5275,2.9859,0.1692,0.8507,1.7351,0.7668,6.1397,3.048,0.4702,1.3849,2.5117,5.3588,0.6932,0.333,0.8605,0.9037,1.3692,2.2107,2.99,1.6859,4.0929,0.0673,3.0421,1.289,2.8797,1.9936,2.0036,2.3913,1.6128,1.5485,0.0353,3.1326,0.0276,5.5369,4.6824,0.0017,5.7498,0.1003,1.1101,1.8718,2.985,0.1918,4.275,6.1299,3.2586,1.2981,3.483,4.8524,3.7618,5.047,1.7036,5.7086,3.4434,0.2972,4.1815,0.2253,0.1036,0.1187,1.6149,1.905,4.8131,1.8354,1.1003,0.0257,4.714,3.9644,2.3597,2.7418,2.7741,1.1469,1.6561,0.1515,3.0353,2.1041,1.0949,1.9651,2.8587,0.369,1.4918,1.2922,3.8264,3.232,1.775,0.3118,1.9515,4.1424,0.1398,2.0321,0.0093,0.9239,3.156,0.0492,3.1334,2.2735,2.0493,2.3317,1.1292,5.5467,3.2111,4.4488,1.0449,1.9306,2.1601,5.0794,4.9487,0.9463,3.2367,2.0189,2.3757,1.2932,1.5641,0.8235,0.4284,3.4407,2.6339,3.1363,1.4573,0.6938,3.4132,3.2856,1.3598,3.3131,3.2501,0.0002,4.6861,1.2609,0.0021,0.2056,0.6613,0.5012,2.4597,2.3841,0.0067,1.0351,4.0803,1.91,0.0569,0.6226,0.1886,0.1535,0.2109,0.1969,1.029,0.1973,2.2591,2.6288,2.9967,0.0109,0.8859,7.5193,0.2519,0.816,2.589,3.2796,2.0101,4.4316,1.4394,3.7882,1.514,0.2024,1.0914,0.417,3.7314,3.6909,0.3157,0.9764,1.8938,2.6979,5.7545,0.8842,2.4111,1.2343,0.4473,2.0852,5.4828,0.6787,1.9326,0.0019,1.1145,0.4601,3.9401,0.6065,0.082,0.253,1.7684,0.0003,0.0009,0.531,1.1656,4.5295,3.6621,0.7213,1.5204,0.2512,0.1456,1.92,1.377,2.1726,3.066,0.4013,2.4951,5.1502,0.1506,2.0494,4.9026,0.417,1.8074,0.6575,4.0562,5.1539,5.4255,3.6443,1.5323,2.4593,1.6928,5.4839,5.6937,0.9624,1.7323,1.61,1.7544,1.4598,5.6716,2.7951,5.8809,0.5168,1.5667,2.099,0.7101,2.8274,0.221,1.7452,7.2933,2.4897,6.2521,6.1438,0.2065,1.8112,5.9481,1.4796,1.2145,2.3372,0.0129,5.6649,1.5415,4.0954,7.1255,2.6828,3.6295,1.184,0.4975,5.1637,5.4255,1.4036,1.1184,2.9308,0.0064,0.3096,2.7298,0.0313,1.6039,1.5201,5.0992,3.1581,3.3777,0.0149,0.2587,1.4601,2.7256,2.5769,1.3544,2.2607,2.5757,1.6137,6.1673,0.8603,4.5449,4.4134,1.7589,2.3803,0.1224,3.2751,0.899]}
{"id":3000,"ended":true,"length":371,"gen_text":"The first tropical cyclone of the season was observed on August 12, about 500 mi ( 800 km ) southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Its entire track was unknown, and its final wind speed of 40 s (25 km \/ s ) was only 50 s (23 km \/ s ) mph. Its wind speed was measured at the high-speed end in several kilometers (30 mi \/ s ) using an inter-route GPS device. The first tropical cyclone of the season was observed during a thunderstorm in Cape Breton on August 27 where it formed at 1.48 am, and became the first tropical cyclone since 1985. This new tropical cyclone was more powerful and more severe than the previous nine on August 27 and August 28, but it was less strong. The second tropical cyclone of the season was visible on August 19 in Cape Breton while another storm was in the forecast for some time. Both cyclones have a peak wind speed of 40 s (25 km\/s) with an overall wind speed of 90 s (60 km \/ s ) mph. This means that the second cyclone of the season may be weaker than the first, as it continues to form. As Hurricane Matthew moves northwest, however, it will produce a new cyclone (a very powerful hurricane), a powerful one, which will then be much stronger. The first tropical cyclone of the season was observed on August 18, about 400 mi ( 630 km ) southeast of Kingston and on the east coast of Australia, where the wind speed was 33 km \/ s, and that then changed to 55 km (33 km \/ s ) with a windshifted wind speed of 50 km (58 km \/ s ) per second, which then gave the second tropical cyclone of the season a strength of 45 km (55 km \/ s ) mph. The first tropical cyclone of the season was observed when a thunderstorm destroyed the Cape Swans in Cape George on August 14.","token_len":396,"entropy":[5.3423,11.2998,1.7621,0.0251,3.1967,0.5796,2.3502,2.3273,4.698,1.1299,3.126,3.3982,0.9156,6.0786,6.3124,6.6837,1.3435,11.2117,0.0539,3.3851,2.4772,0.0238,3.1444,13.6009,2.3121,7.4773,0.6752,5.3117,8.5905,4.2507,0.8005,9.1988,1.676,1.3917,2.7113,5.0411,5.6146,0.8737,1.993,3.6436,5.8563,2.4558,4.6648,1.1225,4.3844,1.9656,3.2239,0.2376,4.3277,4.0539,1.7572,0.1126,4.6125,0.2703,0.08,0.0275,0.9618,4.1776,0.7869,4.5706,3.986,0.8149,0.6982,4.6609,0.5456,3.5668,5.7486,2.5034,1.2962,4.1996,4.8638,5.2991,2.9004,0.4794,2.6246,2.1999,0.828,0.433,1.655,5.3132,2.7015,4.8634,1.5662,4.4654,3.3347,3.6894,0.7808,1.1477,3.2182,1.5703,0.0141,0.0202,0.5281,0.0589,0.1135,0.3851,0.2479,6.7082,2.6045,5.0337,0.0498,1.4226,3.6242,2.9599,0.0025,1.3488,0.5226,3.9947,8.0092,1.0282,5.3946,2.7028,4.3449,1.5427,4.782,2.5805,3.2893,2.2263,5.3739,2.3984,1.1967,0.7763,0.0851,0.0072,3.9663,4.7334,0.4935,3.8781,4.8239,1.3319,0.0457,0.0157,1.164,4.9112,2.5731,2.1389,2.4856,2.9593,0.3529,0.762,0.6116,6.9984,4.7758,0.6948,2.5187,2.3034,1.6333,0.8527,1.0264,2.1129,1.6696,0.7684,2.8874,3.8553,1.1157,1.2433,1.7014,0.2073,0.0065,0.0111,0.3077,0.0094,0.0414,0.2391,6.6042,0.6725,0.8186,4.4852,2.4561,2.2833,1.0688,0.0001,5.1488,4.456,3.673,1.5013,3.8031,0.947,1.1796,1.1633,6.0729,0.3377,0.7482,4.4644,2.39,0.0419,3.9791,2.2535,4.5847,1.3186,0.1119,0.0797,2.1775,0.2609,0.0537,0.1962,0.0147,4.7306,0.1929,1.045,2.6765,2.0879,3.7176,1.4849,0.1724,0.0889,4.2121,0.6012,0.0606,3.1034,0.0805,0.1149,0.045,1.9537,0.9667,0.2422,3.6058,5.4316,0.2808,1.1365,2.4882,2.3545,0.006,1.695,0.0347,0.0683,3.2189,0.9996,4.8102,0.4631,0.1906,0.4663,1.4039,2.9194,1.3138,6.3087,0.1709,2.6289,1.6675,4.8998,4.8915,3.0701,3.4187,3.926,1.4501,4.9874,0.0028,1.5743,1.1063,5.2207,1.235,3.1541,3.2039,0.0141,5.0981,4.2706,5.2191,2.1309,3.2276,1.9366,3.2883,3.5098,3.0457,1.5591,1.8895,0.7102,4.1062,2.3698,4.4768,0.6019,0.8934,1.596,2.6956,0.4301,0.0071,0.0192,0.1189,0.0203,0.0727,0.4761,0.5206,0.6503,0.9137,2.9991,1.4983,1.7905,3.8328,0.2149,0.0033,6.073,0.003,0.0998,0.771,0.0031,6.8674,4.0445,3.5088,1.0885,2.8755,0.0965,0.0831,4.3211,1.6397,3.1944,2.8347,3.1003,0.9352,0.4898,5.2026,2.759,2.3341,0.0253,4.0393,1.2331,6.0586,6.1409,3.2247,0.5062,4.335,0.3176,3.2232,3.9138,0.1284,0.011,0.0066,3.0383,2.1147,0.8779,1.1112,15.1599,2.8754,2.1199,0.8802,0.037,2.7931,1.3513,1.2608,5.734,0.0285,0.0033,0.0034,1.7319,4.4176,1.1535,2.811,2.0382,4.0241,4.9706,1.2493,1.5907,0.1811,0.0231,0.0312,0.7073,0.0242,0.0637,1.5727,3.8246,0.1825,3.8719,2.6209,0.1407,2.7637,0.0473,0.0059,0.0037,1.3488,3.2894,0.1933,0.8674,1.7356,0.0635,0.003,0.0091,0.0455,0.0039,0.0282,0.114,0.3561,5.4751,1.9057,2.4682,0.0283,4.8652,1.7397,3.7768,5.3106,0.7229,2.4815,2.4022,6.3968,1.0369,0.4036,3.3736,1.1217]}

{"id":3372,"ended":false,"length":361,"gen_text":"Upon its release, The Source gave Illmatic a five mic rating, their highest rating and a prestigious achievement at the time, given the magazine's influence in the hip hop community.\n\nHowever, in its current state, Illmatic's popularity has been steadily declining since its release. In November 2015, The Source officially disbanded and has been replaced by a new project, All Star Band of America. The company's current website states that it was founded in 2003 before it was acquired by The Source.\n\nIt is reported that Illmatic's most recent album was \"I Am A MOM\" in 2016. The album has been released on 4-track cassette format, available on the Illmatic Sound app, on various e-sound devices as well as with Amazon. A teaser promo video for the album was uploaded by Illmatic's music director, Jody Lees, on April 8, 2017, with the title \"This Is A Very Rare Episode Of The Illmatic Sound Archive.\"\n\nIn its previous release, Illmatic was known as the Blacklist, making it so many different users that they only got one name. Illmatic gained popularity with the release of the song \"Bubble on a Rock Bottom,\" released on May 17, 2014.\n\nThe full song listing on the Illmatic Sound official website mentions that Illmatic has 5 studio albums (with the album released by EMI ).

{"id":4893,"ended":true,"length":357,"gen_text":"The present Smithfield meat market on Charterhouse Street was established by Act of Parliament : the 1860 Metropolitan Meat and Poultry Market Act. It is a large market with permanent buildings, designed by Smithfield and opened in 1874. The building is on the site of the great popular shopping center of York. The Smithfield Market was founded in 1830 by Thomas Smith to accommodate the growing domestic meat industry of America. The Market took part in the first commercial season during the year 1861 after coming to be the first to have an organic meat and poultry market, and during this season was used as a forum for such discussions as was held by the Congress. The first American Meat Market opened in 1875 and the largest poultry market on North York between May and August of that year, with an impressive number of customers. In 1881, the Smithfield Market was placed in the business of maintaining a supply of fresh poultry products from large exporters, including Great Britain. The new Market established from 1861 to 1868 became the Smithfield Meat, Poultry, and Bison Market, which has a store, restaurant, butcher shop, farm store, and grocery store, as well as a number of small and large stores. As of 1939, the Smithfield Market produced more than 575,000 pounds of poultry (and about 2,500 lb.) through the various supply chains: 5,500 kg from the poultry market, 2,000 lb. from the poultry market, 5,500 kg from poultry market, 4,500 lb. from the Poultry Market, and 1,350 lb. as of 1940 from New York State. The price of this 1\/2-acre, seven-acre farm has fallen to $5.00, and as of the late winter of 1937, only a single American Poultry Market is being opened at the property; the market is in the process of being renovated.

Grosjean is currently riding the worst three consecutive constructors' constructors' championships.\nIt won't sit well with the Red Bull owner if he doesn't have a championship left in the equation, but if he did manage to return to Mercedes with an improvement and his team can continue to have the lead over the reigning champion, then that would be the first title he's won for a long time.","token_len":397,"entropy":[2.9307,9.6079,7.0803,2.2721,0.9183,2.7352,1.0506,0.3871,0.4105,0.8529,0.176,9.1621,0.7107,6.7817,1.2863,11.9801,14.0396,7.9385,6.244,5.3015,4.3888,0.0803,0.598,2.5488,1.8999,1.0633,1.5437,4.7764,0.0411,0.0006,0.9387,3.1175,5.0917,0.0061,0.0,6.1058,5.7564,4.3682,5.053,4.7052,2.7427,4.6633,0.6369,0.378,0.8582,8.0972,1.9893,2.2403,1.2313,5.1082,5.0611,2.6712,1.4292,5.2387,0.117,3.1339,5.0731,4.6456,0.0312,1.4185,0.9632,3.4296,1.4104,4.3958,4.2369,4.2365,2.1241,1.569,2.4743,0.0747,0.0101,0.0187,1.2678,5.2917,1.2468,5.2282,3.5062,2.1066,1.9985,0.4631,1.5379,0.0003,0.0591,0.0996,0.5968,1.6009,3.7893,3.8996,4.9237,0.9758,1.8247,1.8113,0.0361,5.6199,4.4983,2.9338,3.5725,3.7079,0.3895,0.2514,0.1478,2.953,3.1546,3.927,1.5562,4.111,4.9223,1.0634,5.1497,5.3653,0.0164,6.1873,1.4127,3.5401,0.9231,5.9026,0.7632,0.2481,2.945,1.1844,5.69,6.2268,4.0481,2.5527,5.1855,4.2006,4.2392,1.6889,0.7011,5.869,2.9686,2.4885,0.9409,2.4037,2.2815,4.998,4.1142,2.1007,0.3212,5.4332,4.6201,0.0916,1.616,1.7227,4.3153,4.0297,0.4082,0.9783,2.7092,4.2671,0.0039,0.5638,1.3368,5.2988,0.023,1.114,3.6357,1.0337,3.8172,4.5161,3.6037,1.1199,3.6359,2.2986,4.0002,1.565,0.9541,5.7326,1.4186,6.2766,0.4475,4.0542,3.758,2.3516,5.2574,0.3706,4.457,0.4918,2.4847,1.4547,0.6634,0.2319,0.3339,3.5432,0.055,1.4539,3.4441,0.0149,1.1039,3.177,0.04,0.1789,4.8209,2.6145,0.0083,0.3351,3.7629,1.4736,0.5632,1.525,3.2387,3.0258,3.2951,2.2121,3.3237,2.6703,5.1628,2.0274,1.8472,1.7022,4.8006,1.2865,0.1339,1.8905,2.9465,5.5864,4.2382,2.3556,6.0952,0.3737,0.3216,3.3949,1.216,5.8251,5.2233,5.7904,1.724,5.559,0.7497,5.2037,0.0297,1.6733,2.1044,4.2479,4.6157,0.698,0.3744,4.2159,3.3171,0.6957,4.7433,1.3653,5.4517,0.8285,0.9585,3.3214,3.028,2.9133,2.6877,1.3214,1.7878,1.3557,5.2608,0.6552,4.7245,5.318,4.1297,0.0922,0.438,2.9966,2.7052,3.1155,1.2334,3.8109,1.9705,4.4343,3.2498,3.3568,0.9965,2.3994,2.9715,2.9523,1.3403,3.7908,3.6029,3.5035,3.503,1.0669,5.7151,0.0022,0.0414,6.2705,0.6457,0.4023,5.5244,6.8743,6.2958,2.718,5.5609,2.1218,3.2819,0.2489,3.8316,0.0,6.0099,5.849,0.0007,0.025,0.0002,0.0001,0.0,2.2995,3.442,3.061,4.1338,6.6471,0.8376,1.1208,1.0169,3.7293,6.0948,1.498,0.7314,5.097,0.0083,0.0027,0.0006,2.1965,3.0592,4.4369,2.6162,4.9524,5.2457,3.4693,3.4461,0.0035,0.0363,3.2409,0.0062,0.0125,1.6767,3.1521,1.2253,3.7501,5.7767,0.037,6.1132,0.1799,0.0914,1.6962,4.9244,0.0657,4.7282,4.9145,0.8848,2.4973,0.0005,3.5821,1.0847,4.1691,5.0058,1.7736,1.8728,5.8711,1.372,1.9261,3.1242,0.796,3.8612,3.3004,0.1312,5.6125,0.341,4.9138,3.7076,3.3125,3.8338,4.3887,4.681,1.1953,3.8756,3.2189,0.6412,5.4702,2.2348,3.4357,2.5472,1.1162,4.0932,1.989,0.6655,2.0482,2.9358,1.3417,0.8315,3.2879,3.7188,3.746,1.481,1.3452,1.3717,3.0706,2.0891,3.017,0.1807,0.3862]}

{"id":2424,"ended":true,"length":357,"gen_text":"The need for an official state flag arose in 1904 when the West Virginia State Commission to the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis reported that the state required a flag or ensign to represent \"all our citizens in the union or in common or on the public stage.\"\n\nThe commission's regulations required flags for all U.S. states to contain the Louisiana State Flag, not just one of America's other four main-faceted national symbols.\n\nThe Louisiana state flag is the most popular flag used in America and is often associated with American independence, human rights and equality. The flag is the foundationstone of the flag we carry. On the other hand, the flag of the US is largely a matter of political and economic control since United States president George Washington was the first state to use any flag or ensign.\n\nWith the introduction of Louisiana's flag the American people began to demand some form of flag without violating its sovereignty. The flag's constitution, ratified and amended in 1875, states, \"The freedom of the people and the right to live and to assemble shall not be infringed.\"\n\nThe Louisiana state flag was in use for many years. In 1925, state law prohibited a state flag to be worn by soldiers in positions of authority (military or police) while in uniform.\n\nIn the 1930s, the Flag Protection Act (H.J. 2880) authorized the U.S. military to deploy a flag without an official flag. That act is believed to have been passed at the request of former President Richard M. Nixon as part of the effort to stop rising anti-war sentiment and to protect the country from foreign powers. It continues to survive today as a significant, albeit temporary, part of the U.S. political, cultural and social landscape.\n\nAs U.S. flags were in use for many years before the flag protection act was passed, national rights remain largely unrepresented in American society.","token_len":398,"entropy":[7.2375,0.6534,3.5724,5.1012,4.6338,5.2558,7.16,1.6293,6.796,1.2564,1.2955,6.9995,2.4737,2.3851,5.7756,4.5171,4.9363,7.1477,1.4758,10.6329,2.41,4.0813,4.0614,0.0431,0.6119,5.3621,0.6523,1.378,2.4899,5.6662,1.5129,1.6284,5.645,6.7429,0.0007,1.1869,3.1876,2.8001,3.3728,4.3875,2.7624,2.79,1.2563,4.8432,3.9177,2.0509,3.7156,5.2916,3.8063,1.1981,4.8629,2.8168,1.1204,1.8349,0.0004,1.5365,3.5236,2.175,5.493,2.8658,2.7022,3.8485,1.5641,4.0477,0.0013,0.0013,0.024,1.2776,1.5585,5.8356,1.847,5.8628,2.2217,0.6738,1.1775,5.0635,0.7557,3.7738,2.1751,6.0542,0.0171,3.4618,3.0353,4.4759,5.4538,4.7386,5.2494,0.0031,1.7403,2.2222,0.5392,1.434,0.0002,1.5765,3.1284,2.6692,0.1082,2.1701,2.3271,2.7563,2.0128,1.9341,4.8037,1.0516,3.0047,2.5688,1.4621,3.0175,2.7422,0.007,4.0805,3.4911,1.6729,5.7526,0.1475,0.5691,4.6414,0.2762,2.0663,1.4019,1.5566,3.2654,5.5803,7.2655,0.1604,0.899,3.1082,6.5749,4.2191,4.4928,6.015,1.5004,2.6149,0.4624,0.0094,0.9497,1.3212,2.1737,0.7298,6.1526,1.3836,5.2471,2.2813,5.695,0.0264,3.2612,2.5414,2.1134,4.5788,6.7464,6.3863,0.0301,5.505,2.5869,0.2617,2.2042,2.2193,0.8576,5.2859,0.3899,3.0111,6.4617,2.4509,3.5185,0.5085,0.0028,1.2601,0.3921,0.0002,5.003,1.0459,5.0661,0.0034,5.7255,0.7795,0.7841,4.3604,3.3734,2.0559,2.4728,0.2978,3.6263,5.9497,1.2215,0.0017,3.0553,5.5481,5.4786,3.7135,3.2621,0.4138,1.7448,1.9497,3.0306,5.5178,3.1151,4.1264,5.6801,3.4913,0.578,1.3892,4.3238,0.3022,3.1293,2.7535,0.2853,1.434,4.5841,0.1505,0.4577,0.7616,2.8513,1.4541,1.1036,2.6582,5.4283,0.9298,0.9406,2.2991,1.0841,0.0965,0.0102,0.3949,0.0016,0.9319,0.6646,0.0002,1.4101,2.391,1.3487,0.069,1.194,5.141,2.0321,1.7563,3.5567,0.1507,2.9112,1.7816,5.6544,0.7782,5.1302,2.8591,2.2584,3.1799,1.0093,0.5409,3.0243,0.4472,2.7362,1.3492,4.4128,2.4949,5.6768,0.2685,1.3515,4.677,3.5948,1.7542,2.3429,0.9204,3.4184,1.5688,0.7496,0.6844,1.6601,0.0002,1.3469,2.744,2.5098,0.0543,0.5572,1.1777,4.8406,1.6773,0.0933,2.7586,3.6216,0.1232,4.5774,0.0296,5.1743,4.4181,0.3644,3.6664,0.9094,4.4611,0.0006,0.0018,0.0024,2.2174,0.1618,4.4246,1.5656,0.8021,4.3375,3.427,0.3145,1.9024,1.3692,5.2219,1.7366,4.2821,5.114,0.0514,0.0683,1.1095,3.0131,4.2641,0.3552,1.4369,0.004,4.9182,1.2851,3.3468,1.8321,0.0184,0.0511,3.858,0.899,0.0006,1.1762,3.4943,0.0388,3.8367,5.6446,3.3334,0.0221,2.5864,0.9365,2.8836,2.334,2.9285,1.0257,3.4795,0.6802,3.3473,3.4526,0.3146,4.8404,6.2755,0.3311,7.0999,1.1834,2.3005,0.8997,5.905,5.2488,2.8428,3.6085,0.2534,3.0498,0.0016,0.5852,2.5015,0.0005,0.001,0.043,4.208,4.0318,1.9175,0.2785,2.1147,2.7765,0.1792,0.2263,0.0002,4.1157,5.7922,0.0018,0.0016,0.0037,2.872,3.348,4.58,0.419,1.2903,1.5734,0.1113,1.8185,0.7213,3.0523,1.7728,0.4391,0.8087,0.875,0.4135,5.6965,5.6755,5.7892,3.7137,2.5058,4.4406,1.0889,1.6801,1.7678,0.2707]}

M104-10 uses the `` Flashing System `` and the ``Flashing Missile `` in a way that resembles the ``Frog `em-l-a-tong'' ( `Gem_lar_a_tong) which was used in the U.S. Army's F-8 Fighter.\n\nDuring the war, the U.S. Army fielded the M134 the same day it was inducted into the Navy.\n\nThe American forces of the world are now working with partners like Germany, China, and South Korea in their efforts to increase missile defense capabilities in their countries and to build a modern, effective counterstrike capability in the field.\n\n\nTop of Page U.S. Air Force PTO Sustainment Project History (Part 1) Top of Page\n\nA Summary of Top-Secret Programs","token_len":398,"entropy":[5.6983,9.1804,5.3714,2.6456,7.9649,0.6163,6.7863,7.2871,4.497,2.1397,8.4563,2.3722,8.4874,4.3903,0.0374,0.9613,9.5951,16.5663,12.4439,5.6992,6.1882,8.6658,5.9959,2.1007,2.6517,8.8773,0.8244,8.6724,13.5526,2.6511,1.0655,8.1552,5.8332,1.9596,3.7679,2.1736,7.5795,6.0788,2.0368,1.4564,3.9189,5.3507,2.0612,5.1852,5.4553,2.8398,2.4159,1.8474,5.0174,1.9917,4.1281,1.3634,0.8745,2.4119,4.399,1.8975,2.4543,4.5511,0.9465,0.9515,3.4042,2.5175,0.8787,2.5732,2.4906,0.5738,4.6344,0.7374,3.8878,0.0014,0.3055,6.0059,4.9207,4.5216,1.6207,1.7942,0.0397,2.0354,1.861,2.4853,2.6805,0.5984,0.5471,0.0966,5.9036,3.7797,5.0126,0.8047,2.3022,3.291,2.5973,5.4638,0.7253,1.099,2.7904,1.3607,4.6782,2.59,1.0051,5.1014,1.8459,0.781,2.8632,0.0091,1.9527,3.0899,6.3909,4.1469,4.5372,3.0375,4.0441,1.5298,0.4341,2.5595,2.2139,0.4017,4.9182,2.282,1.7622,2.4234,3.6929,1.2202,1.7295,3.5341,0.0014,0.0056,1.7866,2.8048,0.0356,0.9695,1.9348,4.124,1.1121,4.6006,0.0203,3.0892,5.957,4.9452,4.223,0.7972,2.9363,4.0182,0.3712,3.5034,2.555,6.0163,0.3521,0.2921,2.1582,3.6302,0.7866,2.4818,0.9906,3.4421,4.641,1.1701,1.747,4.8278,2.3448,7.6633,2.3376,1.5052,1.3555,3.6663,0.4312,5.3991,5.7415,4.3666,3.97,2.2531,5.5987,2.0892,5.1825,2.0163,2.7939,4.0457,1.1947,1.3328,1.2325,2.2885,0.1918,1.4966,0.0617,5.2024,5.0752,3.1262,2.2419,4.9031,1.5103,0.0735,1.1415,0.5085,5.232,0.8636,1.3798,4.6277,3.3889,2.3314,3.0812,2.4917,0.6523,3.6878,2.8167,0.2197,0.0104,0.5776,0.5918,2.4529,5.3223,3.7367,0.0201,2.3534,5.7657,1.6977,4.4514,3.7502,2.8416,6.2569,0.0969,4.6942,1.0068,4.2215,0.9424,6.6609,2.7089,3.9194,0.2414,1.005,0.0411,5.8018,1.6118,1.0599,4.2865,0.2776,1.6174,0.8294,2.9733,2.2009,0.1958,2.386,0.3637,3.3513,0.5618,3.3698,2.836,3.3261,0.4453,5.2538,0.9399,1.3413,3.2626,3.3253,3.5453,4.6392,3.635,4.2681,2.2063,3.2203,0.3659,3.0264,4.8856,3.4187,3.8393,6.9192,3.5343,3.5077,6.8563,4.9369,1.0188,2.802,0.2349,0.5502,0.0742,2.4155,5.0952,1.7144,0.9444,1.1819,0.4924,2.8029,0.0016,0.0097,0.1062,1.7364,1.3508,3.5878,0.4286,3.9006,4.4767,2.072,1.4501,0.0003,3.7094,0.5932,3.7203,0.3918,0.9254,2.6772,0.0008,0.003,0.0561,1.5361,4.4538,2.2009,1.0561,5.4202,6.155,1.8262,1.7325,1.9988,0.6023,4.5558,0.0005,0.0957,0.1381,2.8425,0.9401,3.1395,0.0004,1.6652,5.7796,5.4564,2.9871,0.6333,3.5763,2.9291,3.2525,3.8983,2.0469,5.646,3.7344,2.7021,1.0121,4.9657,0.0913,1.115,2.5798,0.0429,2.8926,3.0312,0.9198,0.0454,4.5753,3.7612,0.4534,1.2155,2.3022,2.6042,1.842,2.2601,1.5162,3.36,2.229,4.188,1.2225,3.0401,5.239,3.4454,0.7645,2.3082,1.2218,4.4399,0.7562,4.6523,0.0007,5.7716,0.7132,0.2236,6.6172,0.3007,0.0035,0.0688,2.3459,0.1012,5.7412,5.5464,5.672,3.5601,0.2479,4.7359,5.5146,3.85,3.8192,0.9323,0.5329,4.3502,0.2188,0.0179,2.1646,0.0008,4.5052,5.634,0.1389,4.8914,3.4363,1.8904,3.2304]}

{"id":109,"ended":true,"length":380,"gen_text":"Polish culture persisted in underground education, publications, even theater. The Polish Underground State created a Department of Education and Culture ( under Stanis\u0142aw Lorentz ) which, along with a Department of Information and Public Relations, established the Polish Underground Youth Council ( PYC ) to oversee and strengthen the activities of the PYC. Its main mission has been to develop educational resources for Polish men and youth, and protect children from violence and poverty. The Polish underground community of youths participated in and supported Polish resistance during World War II in Poland and the Korean War in Korea, where they were seen as the only victims in the Warsaw massacres, and were encouraged to play with weapons, read and teach. In the 1950s, KwaZulu-Natal University founded the Polish Underground Youth Council ( PYC ), which is supported by the Polish military and a large number of volunteers. Although the group is funded in part by the Polish government (as its predecessor), its funding goes from a single, state-funded pension fund. It has also received funding from the Polish military and from a number of other agencies during the occupation period. In addition, the Polish national guard is responsible for the training of officers on the German and German Marshall Plan, and the Polish army is responsible for military operations (including defense) during World War II. PYC continues to organize, organize, train and defend public meetings, and to help children and young people understand what their peers learn during the war. During the Korean civil wars, Polish youth participated in the Korean Winter Olympics in Korea. When the war ended in 1946, many Poles became unemployed and joined the Polish Army. By 1948, only three years after the liberation of the Soviet Union from France, the Polish Army and the Polish National Guard had become permanent members of their respective units. On 14 January 1949, the Polish National Guard captured the PYC in a combat in the Korean Sea that occurred between the Korean War and the liberation of the Soviet Union.","token_len":398,"entropy":[6.6207,6.9387,11.5656,1.4752,9.4815,8.0057,1.9901,11.0433,0.7265,5.982,6.0407,0.7265,2.1974,4.6957,5.809,8.6809,6.2127,1.1049,7.7875,0.2824,1.8435,2.7875,4.1482,2.4831,12.5024,9.8196,4.433,0.0294,0.0054,11.8961,3.0608,0.3221,0.7362,2.5385,3.4771,3.8051,0.0025,2.8777,3.9907,0.0555,4.514,1.1117,4.063,2.3573,1.0088,3.8488,1.1976,1.7408,1.0909,4.5366,3.4729,0.7713,2.8411,3.9951,1.5193,2.1782,4.3143,2.2645,5.6178,1.2922,4.1512,0.2128,0.7773,2.708,0.0197,0.5401,5.9158,3.0586,1.8588,5.9787,0.2031,0.2703,2.9256,3.9057,3.8317,0.924,1.1807,6.4541,0.8073,4.2914,1.7018,1.9136,6.4739,4.5591,0.7199,2.9404,0.9643,4.364,0.3558,1.6739,1.5408,3.3477,3.9467,4.3983,5.4785,5.2944,0.1066,4.2616,2.8943,3.2452,4.9089,3.2233,1.0072,0.0098,0.2784,3.8251,1.4928,1.5628,2.6027,4.839,0.1203,1.0713,0.4684,2.0736,3.8149,1.3512,2.4006,5.9409,0.1601,2.4365,3.6855,3.6714,4.5449,0.8612,3.6275,6.1903,2.8736,1.4744,2.4591,5.4968,0.3901,5.7663,3.7566,2.9865,2.3236,5.4101,2.2916,5.0918,1.4516,2.3565,1.8086,2.9898,0.2357,0.8314,6.2671,4.6684,0.124,0.0007,0.1499,0.0146,0.0003,5.5749,4.9481,0.708,0.8068,0.8061,1.5061,0.8793,0.8556,0.4136,0.0255,1.1325,1.0768,3.2147,5.797,0.2605,0.7491,1.1587,3.8585,1.1987,4.6634,2.9446,1.4113,0.0039,3.2927,0.8204,4.8686,1.1278,5.3744,2.2836,5.3907,3.6641,0.1775,0.1444,0.9554,0.9907,1.014,3.7569,4.0613,4.9876,3.9334,2.8183,1.8828,3.864,5.0769,5.6477,3.1153,4.4855,3.9876,3.4263,0.2742,1.2728,4.8776,0.6203,2.2144,3.1669,1.8097,2.0439,2.6871,1.974,0.0928,0.6173,1.2584,1.975,1.5877,2.5694,2.4981,1.8501,0.0068,2.1376,3.7038,6.2309,0.5402,6.1401,4.5146,0.4752,2.2765,2.7902,0.5188,1.0007,0.8958,4.9001,3.8492,2.5628,2.8745,0.0239,1.4859,3.4987,0.6081,5.9992,4.2156,0.8835,5.7839,2.5727,3.2732,5.8229,1.1856,1.85,1.1245,1.8307,0.7023,2.605,1.7187,0.9171,0.016,3.9656,1.6846,5.065,2.4779,5.4406,3.2156,2.9395,1.6682,0.0026,0.073,0.2633,3.571,0.0728,5.2912,0.1401,4.8703,3.0713,2.8459,0.7221,3.0863,0.867,5.7594,5.8538,5.5372,1.1007,2.2554,2.9252,4.8565,4.4218,2.0147,1.541,0.5368,4.0296,3.767,3.2691,5.6533,5.3441,2.9497,1.526,2.3741,0.5428,4.2019,0.6413,2.6193,5.5649,4.9927,0.5373,2.4164,1.5885,1.4386,0.0774,1.8045,2.6012,5.3568,1.5388,1.9744,2.7657,1.5298,5.457,0.9215,2.7205,0.4344,0.8205,4.7238,0.0953,3.7381,2.1518,3.5189,4.5277,1.0596,4.801,0.2183,1.1795,3.0629,0.695,4.7302,3.1222,0.1489,4.1933,4.1265,2.221,0.2462,0.331,3.9492,0.1135,2.8569,1.8571,0.0053,2.6172,4.9588,0.2122,1.6879,0.2718,1.6068,2.8042,1.0278,0.2468,1.6292,0.2701,1.8847,3.649,5.7171,1.1583,0.2561,5.5362,1.7743,3.6042,0.394,4.5429,5.5661,2.4434,1.7766,0.099,1.0464,0.3944,1.971,0.386,6.023,1.3382,4.8203,0.2344,2.3388,2.2796,5.7705,2.0684,0.9972,2.9288,4.6537,5.1486,3.8638,3.1926,1.7872,2.6848,3.3034,0.5791,0.3929,2.2922,0.0512,1.2516,0.5542,0.0075,0.2683]}
{"id":4532,"ended":true,"length":352,"gen_text":"NAACP leaders offered Du Bois the position of Director of Publicity and Research. He accepted the job in the summer of 1910, and moved to New York after resigning from Atlanta University.\n\nDu Bois' career began in 1889 and continued into the 1920s, when he formed the National Council for Social Welfare. On Nov. 20, 1919, he resigned his position as a professor of public administration at West Point and became the first black person to join the NNWC and the first African American man to leave it. Du Bois was nominated for President at the National Rifle Association's November 1922 meeting. In 1925 he became Vice President of the NRA, which was renamed the National Council of Women; he moved on to Vice President Richard J. Nixon, with whom he also discussed policy.\n\nIt is now known that Du Bois, Sr., was the son of Robert and Susan Du Bois. His father died in 1913. He lived in the Atlanta suburbs until the mid-1970s. As part of his research, however, Du Bois conducted a series of searches regarding his grandfather's social connections with other black people, including Roberta LaMotte and the Nellie LaMotte Foundation. Du Bois found two large American organizations that endorsed Du Bois (Elders of the Peace, one of the founding foundations of the NNWC) in the Atlanta area. Du Bois also conducted several research groups, working on the relationship between racial and civil rights movements in the mid-1970s and the rise in white supremacy in the mid-1980s. Du Bois also co-authored several textbooks and articles.\n\nHis interest in African American history was an unexpected turn after he wrote \"An American Race: The Beginning and End of a Century of Political Violence\" in 1977. Du Bois published the book in July of that year in support of racial equality. The book is now available at the University Press of Missouri Press.","token_len":399,"entropy":[11.7057,6.2544,7.555,10.9256,4.6971,0.0023,2.6779,5.6266,0.374,5.1678,0.1601,3.3292,8.3926,1.2183,4.7073,1.9305,2.4199,3.1685,1.3601,2.5633,2.7928,3.258,2.5413,0.0655,9.1057,1.5131,1.2526,5.4781,0.5758,2.6178,0.2396,4.5505,7.2215,0.0031,0.7921,9.4924,3.238,1.257,1.5132,0.0024,1.3999,0.0038,0.0005,3.167,3.2633,2.4811,0.716,5.7114,3.1104,1.762,2.4496,0.9187,1.6828,0.0504,1.1615,0.8765,0.1743,5.3498,0.3543,2.9796,4.1948,1.4432,3.5181,3.6276,1.0338,5.4319,5.6169,0.0178,3.5716,0.0312,2.5349,0.0494,0.9794,4.146,1.7328,0.7901,0.7496,3.5711,4.1948,0.6631,3.3552,3.017,0.8645,5.888,0.5708,1.6267,1.9766,1.5905,2.279,2.8223,4.8868,0.2188,5.0687,0.2397,3.6504,7.7029,1.1991,3.8972,2.0716,1.0695,1.5054,0.8214,4.8494,0.2005,5.2223,2.3761,0.2334,2.2547,0.0029,0.0009,1.6201,4.7189,1.0514,3.1877,3.8412,0.2987,3.5177,4.8578,0.0089,0.8832,5.252,4.1303,1.8207,0.8394,2.6517,3.3718,2.1217,1.767,3.8904,0.2726,0.38,0.3457,3.4854,1.714,2.8196,2.1271,2.209,0.2095,0.8205,3.4181,1.1116,4.396,6.1336,1.4259,5.8796,2.7463,0.1102,4.9051,0.1324,6.0726,3.0912,0.0356,1.1936,2.0221,5.0481,0.3734,0.0794,3.8758,4.4783,4.4116,1.5449,0.8742,0.0001,5.874,1.2739,4.8187,1.8282,0.1737,0.7064,0.0044,0.0009,3.0947,6.4996,0.4241,1.6247,1.959,2.99,0.0388,4.3785,1.4795,3.8247,0.6475,0.0367,0.0019,1.233,2.4818,0.8823,2.0777,0.6876,5.0836,1.4537,2.4034,4.3539,0.8862,2.5728,4.2677,2.8936,1.8112,2.9502,2.6521,0.1143,2.9759,0.0692,0.9405,5.1959,4.8457,0.001,0.9145,3.8004,1.1335,7.2253,0.0011,1.1916,0.0054,0.0016,3.8537,1.6241,1.1848,0.0083,6.1468,7.0297,2.783,3.9962,0.3408,5.3174,4.959,3.2049,4.1185,1.5017,1.8915,2.032,1.1612,5.336,4.5389,5.4148,3.7004,3.0269,2.394,3.5445,4.7124,5.3283,0.4665,3.5198,0.2745,0.0448,2.358,0.59,2.6738,0.0022,0.002,3.278,4.8517,5.5195,5.735,4.7698,1.281,5.8131,2.3713,0.0148,0.0015,5.2057,5.5923,2.9469,0.9056,2.7218,0.7361,1.9246,1.0619,5.3818,0.7859,1.0769,3.8321,3.055,0.2897,0.2582,1.7187,0.3116,0.0361,1.9776,2.8503,1.4738,3.366,0.2745,1.0049,2.3517,0.0019,0.0026,1.6173,3.0654,3.2809,2.5161,3.9413,2.3886,5.8974,1.904,2.0502,3.9653,0.0978,3.6104,1.545,5.0376,0.0415,3.6347,1.7526,0.4805,4.5872,0.0777,1.7,0.0044,1.311,0.9979,4.141,3.5684,4.0046,2.5598,0.8768,0.2261,2.8514,0.0254,0.9058,0.0001,0.1699,2.0304,0.0011,0.0024,1.4344,5.2279,0.1916,1.106,2.8112,4.6707,1.9726,1.714,2.8037,0.864,0.0001,4.275,4.8793,0.1043,2.6479,0.4225,1.3855,2.1258,5.1501,5.2865,2.8368,4.2191,1.6624,5.7188,3.2516,4.6092,1.5856,4.7685,2.9363,1.638,5.904,1.3792,0.7709,0.1203,2.5985,3.281,0.6079,4.5777,1.792,1.6652,0.8123,4.4705,0.3244,1.8314,0.0009,0.0019,3.6069,1.9698,0.4634,0.9194,5.4963,1.6611,0.628,0.0562,3.4793,4.189,0.0111,5.0993,1.5447,1.033,2.4227,0.4063,2.6503,2.403,1.9013,2.7226,1.4546,2.0554,1.7521,0.0998,4.4022,1.8301,0.4456]}

{"id":995,"ended":true,"length":373,"gen_text":"A tropical wave located near the Lesser Antilles spawned a tropical depression on September 12. It is estimated that the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Hilda early on the following day. Hilda quickly receded over the Lesser Antilles to the northwest, and the depression increased to its eastern center. In November it hit the north side of the Lesser Antilles to the southeast, where its depth increased to nearly three feet. The storm is now heading west. [ 5 ] During the month of September, Hurricane Harvey made landfall, and the hurricane continued to devastate Texas. However, it returned to Texas in mid-August, after being one of the biggest storms of all time. There are a variety of reasons for why Hurricane Harvey is now more dangerous to the Texas Gulf Coast\u2014 the Gulf of Mexico is flooded faster than it can recede, a large coastal area can be inundated, and Houston is threatened with flooding.\n\nHurricane Harvey is considered to be causing significant damage and damage to local communities. As part of its continuing effort to recover and restore to its previous condition, Harvey has destroyed the Gulf Coast. Harvey's magnitude makes landfall in Texas in about 20 days and continues to disrupt the state of Texas.\n\nHurricane Harvey is classified as a Category 3 (small or massive hurricane), a Category 8 (rain), and a Category 5 (hurricane) ( Figure 1 ).\n\nHurricane Harvey is considered a \"small hurricane\", similar to the tropical cyclones that form in the Gulf of Mexico. The storm is rated by the National Hurricane Center. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), an international forecaster for Hurricane-force systems, assigns Harvey as the \"small hurricane\". The storm, though relatively smaller by comparison to its size on September 21, is rated for \"severe\" potential at the National Hurricane Center. The storm is also classified as a Category 4 (medium or large hurricane), where it's classified as a small hurricane.","token_len":399,"entropy":[11.6242,6.3085,9.361,2.6262,1.0275,11.5539,0.1492,0.7755,0.0606,11.2387,1.3683,4.3857,5.0214,2.9693,4.104,3.4026,1.9581,2.8411,2.2698,3.0483,0.4114,2.0711,3.8992,6.9866,4.2152,6.3778,0.8517,5.391,5.4417,5.8086,1.3468,3.1729,3.353,0.7279,0.7662,4.8237,0.0314,6.4356,4.1109,0.0353,4.5387,0.6249,5.956,0.0037,0.0107,0.0,3.9672,1.3401,2.9845,1.2768,1.765,2.107,2.9489,4.7689,1.3574,2.9828,5.2377,4.0225,1.2888,3.5732,5.0714,3.716,4.3261,0.8462,4.3104,3.1785,0.0795,0.5095,1.3459,0.0018,0.0044,0.0001,4.3455,0.8186,1.9487,1.1494,3.5899,4.7162,4.1131,2.1293,0.474,3.3179,3.5688,0.6916,0.3862,1.6401,3.1787,3.3918,2.3721,4.2916,2.4632,1.7457,5.204,7.4989,0.2557,5.1149,0.7527,4.3065,0.0946,1.1501,0.5656,2.9538,2.9667,2.7934,0.0271,3.8503,2.244,1.9261,2.6795,4.2829,0.4169,5.6975,0.0004,1.9433,0.8247,4.8799,0.0319,2.5012,4.7484,0.7035,2.4517,1.91,2.8389,0.0406,2.6479,1.1385,4.4549,2.7345,5.1119,0.0853,0.1316,4.1463,1.3419,1.8288,3.4532,0.1241,0.312,5.5993,2.0934,3.4718,3.5653,0.0018,3.3642,0.5766,3.4703,2.1869,0.0151,2.3943,2.6702,3.7538,2.8014,1.5373,1.8753,2.159,3.0447,0.0168,6.3852,5.2962,3.5767,2.0598,0.0066,1.3008,4.071,5.0215,0.4145,2.9343,1.9079,3.1596,0.015,0.8935,4.9202,4.0267,4.7521,1.4672,3.467,0.9093,1.5111,0.0002,0.9683,0.327,5.4055,1.3017,4.7887,0.8026,1.5013,0.986,2.9634,0.0064,2.3452,0.0947,0.2166,1.8093,3.5903,1.2683,0.2553,7.2604,2.8184,0.5313,3.8508,1.995,0.3308,4.7305,1.4199,0.9372,4.1539,4.7288,0.0011,1.1404,4.6856,3.4379,0.1069,3.7768,3.2923,2.6681,4.306,1.0213,3.1983,2.1001,0.1137,2.8644,1.3782,4.5736,3.5199,3.8536,0.2732,2.1838,4.0494,1.984,4.4578,3.4337,1.9104,1.0913,1.5095,2.4205,4.3889,3.3349,0.5788,2.5665,4.3951,0.2313,5.4187,1.4567,4.3331,2.7292,0.1899,1.1252,1.8062,0.0003,1.9672,0.0428,0.2687,1.1454,4.0119,0.1979,0.5317,0.1353,1.951,3.6743,5.6267,3.6967,6.4306,2.5018,1.4674,2.2181,1.6311,3.6585,0.2488,5.4929,4.8983,0.7096,0.3103,0.3583,0.9854,0.3089,2.4282,0.003,0.8038,5.108,5.2018,1.1225,0.3315,1.7047,0.0003,0.8562,0.0225,0.122,1.0033,2.4484,2.4925,3.5193,3.9308,2.7123,1.9832,6.7382,0.0485,1.714,4.0757,0.6754,2.2374,1.2569,2.8227,1.2891,0.9897,2.8084,0.2806,0.0069,0.6963,2.1696,3.7138,1.206,4.1823,2.7675,0.5176,1.4812,0.2715,0.0023,5.3104,2.1294,5.0314,0.0026,0.0068,0.0047,2.0928,0.0236,1.5097,0.2818,0.0146,3.1939,4.5652,2.2682,3.7592,0.1584,4.0334,3.41,4.134,1.418,5.3932,0.262,3.8308,1.6987,2.3874,1.7625,1.8946,2.0912,1.0736,1.7846,1.9107,2.4524,3.5581,4.3905,4.8742,4.5915,5.7796,2.7868,0.3966,2.7187,1.7833,5.772,2.6505,5.2467,0.2113,0.636,3.8695,5.0119,3.6549,2.5359,1.2693,5.6389,5.1675,2.1324,2.4372,0.1045,0.0059,0.9091,1.9528,1.6013,1.0573,2.3105,2.3094,0.1118,0.2153,2.0761,1.1193,0.7566,2.2685,0.9821,0.5043,0.3388,0.7106,6.6829,0.6844,4.0245,3.2133,0.0855,0.3872,3.5871,0.2563,0.9645]}

At the instigation of his American publisher, George Tubb, Tubb published the first book of the first trilogy of The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Tubb also directed and co-edited Harry Potter, in which he created a trilogy of stories based on books written and published after his childhood home was destroyed.\n\nThe author Peter Jackson wrote a trilogy of The Lost and the Found, and later adapted them for television. The series were produced in four years by CBS, Warner Bros Pictures and Universal Pictures (all with Lucasfilm and the studio that produced films), and were distributed through Fox Television Studios. In 1966, James Bond director Steve Ballmer directed one of the last two TV series to appear on television, while another was produced in the US by Warner Brothers Ltd., and sold by Sony Television Studios during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nIn 1968, Tubb returned to work at the Smithsonian Institution. He became a Fellow of the American Museum of Natural History and served as Director of Public Affairs. Later in his career, he wrote and co-edited the short tale, based on the American edition of The Black Tome. He won a National Book Award for his work. His novels, however, also ran under different names, and became known as The Tales of Puddippet, The Tales of Rachni and the Tales of Ymir. In the 1970s, he edited two anthology series.
