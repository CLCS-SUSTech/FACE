In early 1966, after three decades in the business, Cooney was appointed CEO of the CBS Broadcasting Department because he loved and respected Dr. Kooning and was willing to give up the work of doing his talk shows. The following year, he quit.\nWith Kooning retired, Cooney and his wife of nine months, Helen, moved westward and he became chairman of CBS Television Studios. With his wife and his four children, Cooney became one of the biggest television evangelists in America. In 1978, Kooning moved on to a new company called \"TV & Film Studios\" which, according to his own account, now features nearly 40 hours a month of shows with over 100 programs. During the 1980s, Mr. Kooning gave away more than $14 million to pay and support his local community. As part of his continuing effort to bring about the reform of television TV, he created his own program, \"Trolls in America,\" which received a number of accolades, such as being the third most viewed program of the year.\nOn his deathbed, Cooney wrote his last written remarks in 1999, one year before the closing of his studio. ( Cooney died of cancer on Monday, May 23, 2004. He was 93 years old today, and he had been working on his life's work for 35 years.) At his death, his parents said as they watched the closing hours that they had been struggling with suicide for over a decade and he died of heart failure.\nCooney was survived by his three sisters, a niece, a nephew, and their mother and his two brothers, an older brother, a neighbor, and their grandparents.\n(This website links to a video of Cooney's speech titled, \"Why We Know He Died\")","token_len":400,"entropy":[11.0584,0.3373,9.3371,4.9978,3.3229,1.9223,6.9483,9.0415,0.9935,1.6512,3.5834,5.1486,11.0034,5.7727,2.9151,2.3222,4.8008,9.2669,1.7916,2.0725,2.9451,3.1371,4.1156,3.9563,2.1628,0.3567,0.5483,4.0214,1.8184,1.1059,6.5736,1.3427,2.335,0.2967,2.1778,5.5666,2.5475,0.1896,3.6235,4.5245,2.3329,2.1562,0.8375,1.5253,0.1749,1.5866,0.0006,1.8793,4.3404,3.6117,0.2461,1.498,4.8103,1.9923,5.0903,7.9343,1.1982,6.1805,4.8426,1.0987,5.6843,0.0258,5.5483,4.4963,1.084,2.0622,2.9221,3.0767,0.0116,3.055,2.0082,2.5221,4.9014,0.826,4.9163,2.5399,4.6668,0.7458,0.9095,3.1681,3.9109,0.1234,0.2314,1.5012,5.8439,3.5858,1.1566,11.9379,3.7579,0.0147,0.0025,4.7202,0.3163,0.5687,0.0012,3.6265,1.0457,0.9885,4.8768,4.5684,2.5187,0.5697,5.1206,0.4248,1.7292,6.5888,3.7451,2.6833,5.7723,2.7432,3.2894,0.3134,2.9576,1.6221,1.3747,1.0355,4.7431,2.5891,1.534,2.503,3.3388,4.4791,0.3089,0.5885,0.8872,0.0026,2.8097,3.4932,0.0082,0.3163,3.6276,2.5598,5.8631,0.0371,0.3743,1.0853,0.4556,2.1148,3.9763,0.205,3.6277,0.0136,0.0031,4.4425,3.9427,0.2999,3.0924,0.8744,2.0629,2.1017,4.5229,4.7452,5.153,2.0725,4.1497,1.2732,2.4369,3.4191,2.6574,0.0006,2.665,3.2194,2.7865,0.1527,5.1991,5.569,4.3446,3.1738,4.2275,3.2913,3.1691,0.1493,4.7769,4.5248,2.0808,2.4599,4.4282,1.1689,4.8368,1.5766,1.4212,0.2368,0.2499,6.2532,0.0023,1.3703,0.0066,0.0027,5.3462,3.1453,2.8642,0.0648,0.5049,5.3057,0.1553,0.9572,4.6565,7.6075,3.8546,1.7091,5.0555,3.1265,1.3258,4.2962,2.9777,0.0008,1.2427,5.5068,3.9248,0.1762,3.4102,3.1008,2.5952,5.2966,0.2246,2.8071,6.5289,0.7065,1.3684,3.3317,3.9435,0.0814,3.66,1.5164,0.7418,4.9798,4.8148,1.3682,2.4372,1.4924,0.944,0.6896,4.4041,1.8467,4.6456,0.0022,3.9403,0.001,2.2515,3.3883,0.0037,1.3327,0.9086,4.4399,1.457,3.4436,0.8558,1.5177,0.6309,0.524,2.1435,1.0217,3.631,3.5212,3.1164,0.6623,0.7454,1.6535,0.0065,3.2862,2.9008,1.8773,5.3865,4.8731,2.6721,4.7754,1.5742,5.8967,1.7528,1.9724,2.0302,5.9333,0.2945,0.9279,4.5422,0.5844,5.2232,8.3291,0.0023,1.8758,2.0557,1.6014,1.0841,4.2648,0.6158,2.3431,3.3325,0.1667,3.437,3.1582,2.5081,0.6957,3.4265,0.8952,0.0218,5.7268,3.15,0.815,2.2097,3.6929,1.1664,2.8281,1.1452,0.7487,4.5072,4.3088,0.0719,0.6128,5.0807,0.0228,0.4012,5.4261,1.6271,1.9966,0.9591,2.2404,5.5932,3.1004,7.2443,2.4197,3.151,1.4124,3.3313,6.3869,5.2927,0.9412,2.2791,2.2785,5.7472,1.2234,5.977,2.3642,3.5243,1.1576,0.7479,3.0994,4.5211,5.0223,2.4065,2.2941,0.1066,0.3968,0.9129,2.4528,0.0054,1.833,3.7521,0.0044,0.3491,2.9157,3.5817,0.636,4.3363,3.324,0.5068,1.3315,0.7488,0.5396,0.7335,4.8748,2.8642,3.2632,2.8426,2.6344,2.413,1.2449,5.0296,3.8145,0.6733,0.637,2.4941,7.0258,0.2577,0.3817,3.7434,4.368,0.3589,1.3061,4.4801,4.1819,4.815,6.2154,0.1371,1.6332,3.5886,0.9988,1.029,0.0079,0.6702,2.8253,4.4214,1.5223,0.1434,3.8066,2.3353,5.9492,2.2106,1.3983,3.7072]}

King Richard, accompanied by three nobles, went to London to secure the hostages. During the siege, he was shot in the hip. King Charles also attempted to kill the King, and that's where Henry VII landed as Henry VII's third king.\n\nHenry VII and his wife had been on a boat and when the boat captain tried to pull it on the side he shot him in the head and then stabbed him, leaving his wife dead. The surviving King William was forced to flee, but was captured by the Dutch king and taken home with them. Charles II was also executed.\n\nThe following year, Charles XV, who succeeded as King of England, ordered a large fleet to rescue the King William from the Dutch in England, where he had been captured by the King John VIII's forces and later exiled.\n\nIn 1368, there was a revolt in the north-eastern counties of Kent and Essex, where William remained with his brother Henry, the Duke of Yorcombe in Kent. In 1369, he was captured by the English who attacked.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe most famous incident in Henry VII's reign, one of the most brutal of all the Tudor revolts, occurred in 1373 when five knights, including one of Edward's eldest son William, fell victim to Henry's tyranny. They were the same Edward who had defeated Henry VIII, and that's as clear any account of the events can hope to get. By the time Henry III and his younger brother Henry V were captured in France after the revolution and forced to flee, they had become kings, and their descendants had died by poison. This is the worst-ever instance of a revolt in which anyone was ever held up as king: the first to die was Henry George III.\n\nSee Also","token_len":400,"entropy":[1.9437,10.6083,3.9469,0.0287,0.7415,15.147,0.6222,2.3682,5.5555,4.7533,0.4832,7.1911,2.9446,8.5899,1.7109,3.7988,4.9219,1.5969,3.2472,1.9883,4.2899,6.6471,10.5456,1.091,1.1377,3.1112,0.475,7.2245,0.0491,3.8448,0.9678,5.0214,0.2034,0.0043,0.9038,6.1145,3.3044,2.911,5.4184,0.0451,4.5352,5.3439,0.5619,4.8495,0.6203,1.5533,1.3989,3.9887,0.9196,3.6406,0.8944,4.6816,0.5145,1.0504,0.6164,3.1093,2.2095,4.1462,1.4217,0.0855,4.8723,2.021,3.9174,3.0865,5.2865,4.2782,0.0972,3.598,1.9603,2.6875,2.2425,2.7934,5.2389,4.3443,2.3731,4.8997,2.7178,5.0356,5.9028,4.1678,1.2921,1.1622,4.9269,3.5001,0.4858,1.0838,0.0065,2.311,0.868,3.1383,1.2122,2.0368,4.7501,2.2937,4.1329,0.9139,4.1508,3.7712,4.0814,1.9641,1.4182,4.7419,3.6785,0.0381,3.5879,2.8911,4.9662,1.7774,2.4354,3.9836,3.2833,1.0029,0.9775,0.021,2.0845,2.2978,2.7853,4.2442,0.4135,3.7334,3.2539,2.5043,1.2083,2.0856,0.391,2.1771,5.3821,1.474,4.6661,2.1021,4.7526,0.055,2.19,2.8462,1.2099,2.4777,1.9221,0.8383,0.9089,4.9334,3.9299,2.5124,2.2503,5.9546,2.9783,3.1611,0.3736,5.2555,2.1319,1.6003,2.4855,3.7932,2.1099,0.6825,0.0002,2.1754,3.5453,0.673,0.3626,3.2142,6.2762,2.413,2.1351,4.3621,3.709,1.1906,1.5543,0.5268,0.4899,3.9697,1.8956,4.3923,3.5961,0.9308,5.4758,1.199,2.0988,4.7952,2.1479,1.1533,2.6736,3.6967,4.0464,2.082,3.2982,0.7688,2.0523,0.8159,1.9674,1.3747,0.6429,2.6149,6.0499,4.2529,3.9397,1.8449,3.2319,3.6425,4.5459,1.3411,1.5054,0.0002,2.5054,2.64,4.7397,0.1799,5.7353,0.543,0.4601,2.1767,1.5985,1.8895,4.7445,2.0705,1.66,0.0011,5.6071,0.1004,2.7522,0.4195,0.2417,1.2142,2.094,4.2136,6.043,3.8808,0.5147,3.0227,2.2435,2.4394,3.1267,2.2801,0.0428,5.5056,4.709,4.6605,3.5211,0.8108,3.0695,0.6752,1.4385,0.2288,3.3342,1.3684,2.0845,0.6307,0.7149,2.4372,4.351,3.8229,4.0179,1.7659,0.0002,3.5753,5.2193,0.9442,0.0001,2.0502,5.409,1.4726,3.2746,1.287,2.5931,0.5924,0.0612,0.4911,3.2012,5.2294,0.8404,0.461,0.812,5.198,2.5779,1.302,1.4586,3.9976,0.4142,4.0249,0.0006,0.4721,1.7331,0.5746,0.5847,2.4695,1.3625,6.7902,3.3842,2.4716,2.1505,3.386,1.668,3.9689,2.8355,4.564,3.7465,3.6249,0.424,5.1829,2.2655,0.0167,4.4373,0.8226,5.6103,0.4373,3.1069,0.4135,3.4554,5.1748,3.6674,1.6242,1.3208,4.3155,2.4523,2.1083,2.4171,1.6862,4.4502,1.5994,5.9797,6.0388,7.7861,6.1057,0.3203,1.2271,1.6577,3.0422,5.8571,0.4191,2.4492,0.2468,6.3826,0.8871,0.4721,1.8112,4.0872,3.5706,0.8095,4.3479,0.4242,1.4986,2.7114,1.4849,2.5723,1.7584,4.2044,5.2252,0.8826,4.2472,3.4879,3.6826,0.1663,0.8238,1.1655,2.1557,1.1475,3.6989,4.43,2.4851,1.319,2.8953,4.6566,2.6441,5.2121,4.5285,6.5309,0.5099,4.4732,2.1136,1.8346,5.0232,3.3054,1.9715,4.8502,0.2584,1.3122,5.3797,1.5408,3.8923,5.2413,1.2624,2.9057,2.8898,5.166,0.6316,1.432,4.6909,2.385,3.8461,3.077,1.9654,1.0596,2.0682,7.2015,1.1573,1.6025,0.4093,0.0003,5.6172,1.5671]}
{"id":2905,"ended":false,"length":348,"gen_text":"Along with its combat role, the 4th Armoured Brigade was responsible for developing and deploying specialised types of tanks. Macarthur @ - @ Onslow played an important role in guiding these processes, especially after its success in the Battle of Shrewsbury. During the Battle of Shrewsbury, Macarthur received the highest award for the War for Britain to date. The British High Command ordered Macarthur to provide infantry support for the German occupation during the Second World War and Macarthur received a medal for the courage and skill of he commander during his deployment. However, it is interesting to ponder the status of Macarthur : it was considered so important that it had to remain a symbol of British presence in East Prussia for more than a century, with an impressive number of Allied officers and troops participating in the post-war world.\nMacarthur was created in 1793 by Dr Thomas McCallum, an Assistant Professor of Military History at the University of Sussex and the author of Macarthur, a volume of military history and military studies.\nMacarthur made some of the key decisions during the time period during which the 4th Armoured Brigade occupied the country. It came to occupy a number of key positions during the Second World War, although it never achieved independence from England (which the 4th Armoured Brigade did, by the way, occupy in the war). While there were other areas of influence, where the 4th Armoured Brigade was engaged, the military operations were carried on by the 3rd Brigade of the British Royal Arm. The British Arm would also provide important support to the infantry, while the 1st Armoured Brigade and 2nd Armoured Brigade also fought in France and in France and Belgium. The German invasion of Prussia, after their defeat in 1918, helped develop Macarthur into a key element in their military plans.\nThis website links to additional information: Macarthur History Collection.\nMacarthur History","token_len":401,"entropy":[3.6151,3.375,7.975,3.7094,0.6652,0.8921,7.1364,2.4233,4.8559,1.6311,2.0127,3.0506,4.4087,0.0127,6.6979,1.4892,2.2977,4.9127,1.5738,6.3762,0.0861,3.8649,2.0924,10.4943,5.9875,0.0277,12.7622,7.7402,5.472,9.0971,6.3845,11.3054,2.5818,0.5564,0.159,0.1174,7.5113,5.0714,7.6586,1.7251,3.4554,3.7804,3.7487,3.7537,0.5166,0.9914,1.8371,0.0249,5.8032,2.3977,0.0538,0.0004,1.2351,5.512,0.8395,2.1248,0.0643,2.4486,0.0054,0.0167,0.0017,0.6047,1.1457,0.0027,0.0001,4.3988,1.993,4.0438,2.6685,1.3732,2.5482,5.4156,4.6603,1.4067,5.9481,1.2067,1.3091,2.2679,3.4428,5.6841,0.7767,6.0965,1.4137,0.0042,0.0002,0.4062,4.5166,5.0365,1.2893,1.5231,0.7388,5.4267,4.6483,5.2322,0.3024,2.5993,0.1738,0.0005,2.3456,2.4971,0.0032,0.0001,3.4203,2.1833,3.3118,0.84,2.4828,5.6175,0.917,3.6585,0.6621,6.7919,6.327,2.3524,2.1252,3.9723,0.9225,4.767,0.1891,3.0796,1.4457,4.6073,0.0996,8.0417,1.4288,6.0244,0.069,1.3352,0.0054,0.0002,7.637,2.4041,0.8929,5.0163,5.1099,1.7788,1.1358,1.3762,3.5007,0.449,3.4897,2.5061,5.1575,0.1649,2.4746,5.6676,0.9138,5.1151,3.7288,0.022,2.083,3.3088,0.0009,1.3108,0.6107,2.4886,4.1622,3.8012,4.0598,2.6899,0.0108,5.6202,3.8027,1.5402,2.1304,4.4393,0.4028,0.845,5.556,0.3425,0.3341,5.1224,1.4184,2.7249,3.4897,0.0183,0.0005,1.5209,5.2555,1.2121,3.1849,4.0627,1.3746,4.9364,4.6063,5.5636,2.1848,1.0133,0.9589,2.7308,5.6086,1.9453,0.3113,2.0246,0.1136,0.2775,0.9576,0.7473,0.0234,3.7457,2.1869,2.0168,1.8998,0.0242,4.1292,0.0486,0.0003,3.1081,2.4705,6.1674,0.5486,2.887,0.3202,2.4896,2.6517,4.4501,0.9386,2.9389,1.5975,0.0178,0.0004,5.9732,5.6632,2.924,0.292,5.5301,1.6133,2.8348,0.2875,5.7076,2.9931,3.678,0.0265,1.212,2.8218,0.0099,0.0457,0.0031,0.0947,6.1022,1.3356,4.7154,0.6609,2.3163,5.3581,1.0603,4.7952,2.6386,2.7538,0.01,2.4415,1.4792,2.4282,0.4298,3.2842,0.0414,0.0008,1.0426,5.4849,1.3228,4.0043,3.4167,3.7979,1.9473,3.6354,4.155,3.8304,3.9429,2.2907,0.0036,0.071,0.0044,0.0717,1.5209,3.2412,3.5873,0.8174,0.1458,0.769,2.5362,1.7589,1.86,3.4156,1.0916,4.7617,3.1183,0.7539,4.2913,4.6319,0.9255,3.5083,1.5395,6.429,1.1971,0.7651,0.0019,0.0211,0.0064,0.0513,1.6765,5.7374,1.1357,1.9058,4.676,5.2585,1.7137,3.0147,2.1621,0.806,0.8994,3.3427,0.1658,3.2367,1.9277,0.2707,3.3067,3.3061,2.9401,4.4331,1.7478,3.134,3.5368,5.7019,2.5643,3.8375,5.5545,1.4504,1.0415,0.3909,5.8001,2.3211,3.9396,0.9507,3.8459,0.0037,1.6445,0.0035,0.2937,3.9195,2.4389,0.077,0.4789,0.0046,0.4614,3.3151,3.9233,1.5532,3.8952,1.2304,3.1498,4.8757,2.6759,1.1361,0.544,1.8473,5.1841,2.5854,0.3009,3.0819,0.0006,2.4605,4.3483,5.7891,1.2684,1.1486,3.4552,0.1493,5.3607,5.0918,2.6805,0.0035,0.0002,2.5623,0.6531,3.0116,3.1738,1.2057,4.9848,3.0108,2.9802,0.4773,1.2693,4.3892,5.7092,5.5707,0.3426,5.2636,1.265,4.8053,2.5526,0.0225,0.0005,3.3728,6.3365,2.7314,1.0606,1.8479,0.0181,0.0004,1.829]}

He was attracted to the concept and wrote a video where he pointed out in the video that those who control these beings are children, like him.\n\nWith all due respect also to Mr. Sinha, he has also been doing his best to highlight the shortcomings of society in that he is not a person who likes to use his own words. He is a man who will speak on the evils he has inflicted upon mankind. However, it is interesting to ponder the fact that some have taken advantage of Ra.One's name and who he represents. This is because he would probably have had any good to say about our society as such. This would be an irony to all those who would use what he did as a political tool to destroy his people.\n\nHe has also stated that he likes to use his own'minds' and mind-set which he developed, so there is no need to stress the difference between him and the other men of the village who are also in favor of making the difference in any way we can. In fact, not only have Mr. Sinha personally attacked Ra.One for his personal beliefs, but they also agree that he should be commended for his work, which is also something he can do with only a sincere belief.\n\nThe video where he asks \"why the gods don't treat you like we treat my people.\" which is a classic example of his political philosophy. The video is about how he has used that philosophy against us, and to which he can respond, he is doing so without using his own mind. His message is that \"The gods don't deserve you to do their job and this is why they treat you the way they do. Don't worry about yourself or your children.

{"id":640,"ended":false,"length":362,"gen_text":"To promote the album's release, Scotti Brothers Records purchased full @ - @ page ads in Billboard magazine that advertised the release as Yankovic's `` biggest bash yet ``. Unlike previous's releases, that only ran through April 24th, 2015, we now need to buy those ads with all the ads on top of the previous day's '-_-'. This will enable us to put into circulation an additional $17 million in revenue for Yankovic before his first live release of the album.\n\nAhead of what he's going to reveal at the show, he has taken the opportunity to do some live interviews. The first with the music journalist Chris Lutz posted a clip of him doing some ''tweet'' on April 2. In a follow-up, he shared his thoughts on the song later on. As a result, the song was featured on his ''One-in-a-million'' list, which included songs from the '80s and '90s. He went on to state that he was not joking when he said that Yankovic's ''gotta see it.''\n\nAfter making the track in his bedroom at home on October 9, Scotti Brothers released the album on tour and streamed it through his Twitter feed. When asked if he intended to put the album out through the channel's official stream, which will ship on June 4th, Scotti revealed that he did. At the show, he shared a link to an app with the Yankovic's label that had over 1.3 million people following that live video. As he went on to ask the audience, were you sure it was true and he did, Scotti wrote, \"... if it's true then I can't tell anyone right now what I'm looking for in this moment but if I'm trying to do something, then at least I've got something I can live with.\"\n\nFollow @YachtyB on Facebook and follow Yachty B on Instagram","token_len":402,"entropy":[8.5762,1.6444,8.6421,1.7392,3.1779,0.6058,6.8904,6.2155,9.0922,5.0571,6.111,7.7557,13.9212,9.215,5.8243,8.3761,7.5702,2.7583,5.5789,2.4733,5.2789,6.1769,1.0027,3.2905,3.189,9.3354,4.8231,3.4736,0.8557,10.3114,11.2385,9.8387,1.0497,4.2265,2.3918,7.8319,2.7752,8.5946,3.8199,0.3211,6.088,4.9611,3.402,3.7062,2.571,3.5732,1.8803,1.0874,2.9562,1.1447,5.7697,2.9348,6.0627,0.5558,4.2502,4.2827,1.0393,5.3468,4.1321,1.1285,2.7744,2.5731,4.5063,0.6843,0.9211,5.2329,4.1087,0.7986,6.3861,4.8035,4.9071,3.5617,3.2072,2.2996,5.2136,0.3267,0.0427,4.5915,5.6261,3.3102,3.521,1.7483,1.879,5.2362,1.3444,0.8801,3.1402,1.8963,1.5554,0.0316,0.0019,6.2458,3.472,4.0813,5.2575,3.9976,3.3832,1.4426,0.9063,0.7956,2.1143,0.1804,4.5789,5.0299,0.0076,6.3178,4.1405,1.708,3.1755,0.1356,5.7341,2.2178,1.1356,2.9991,0.4866,3.38,3.5159,4.9996,2.1058,1.4185,0.1179,5.0875,1.6529,3.7885,2.7036,1.9883,2.9256,1.9947,5.8998,3.3979,5.5357,3.3854,5.0801,5.3763,4.3227,6.3333,2.2273,3.0097,0.7707,1.344,3.2177,2.2406,5.0031,4.4928,2.6964,4.3126,2.2904,5.4839,3.8657,3.9991,3.7065,3.368,2.9001,0.6745,0.0024,2.0937,1.087,3.5193,2.8259,1.9677,0.2977,0.9842,3.6136,6.3766,1.3049,1.6296,4.4872,3.022,1.2914,0.4338,1.9196,2.6057,1.7,3.0972,0.5317,2.8879,4.7616,5.5621,3.4978,4.5031,0.0056,1.2852,0.0041,2.0738,1.0956,3.4569,2.7321,1.6584,2.818,3.8978,1.3617,2.5734,3.4483,1.9733,0.0196,1.4291,0.2992,0.0041,0.0026,0.5494,3.1452,4.4068,0.0702,0.0444,4.9458,0.6403,1.114,2.2935,3.4617,5.4399,1.2903,0.0417,0.5497,0.9878,3.6101,0.0054,0.0024,1.8482,2.6024,4.9777,3.9936,5.4327,1.9506,2.7865,0.7522,0.0002,4.1815,5.2464,1.4919,4.5872,4.408,1.9607,4.9705,2.7816,2.5112,2.6093,5.1111,3.2934,1.0575,2.6108,0.0042,1.0232,1.5589,1.1492,1.5741,1.1558,5.962,2.8873,5.4584,0.9186,3.6764,1.3854,3.6528,1.8329,0.6661,5.1759,2.8349,1.3972,0.5753,5.0785,0.0604,4.5933,1.5025,0.8975,0.7357,5.1327,1.906,5.6257,3.9448,3.959,4.4311,1.4256,5.4737,3.4354,6.0013,1.2825,3.026,3.2959,1.052,0.1339,1.5593,0.0006,4.6447,0.4652,0.447,2.3113,2.1635,5.3116,0.6443,2.9152,0.2984,0.7286,3.7184,1.1923,3.819,0.1254,2.7027,5.6637,3.6004,1.6307,5.2758,0.0058,0.0164,3.678,5.4346,2.1962,4.7436,5.9916,2.873,0.9182,2.0958,0.0655,3.2727,3.9057,5.1329,5.5454,2.9227,0.7744,3.9111,2.8012,4.7365,0.1761,0.2093,5.4451,2.4602,1.1746,2.3,5.6207,2.288,3.1565,2.7493,0.4411,3.5864,4.3567,4.3675,3.7113,1.8536,1.9755,0.0005,5.8581,0.6632,4.0612,5.0944,1.6133,1.6879,0.4999,2.6865,1.1499,3.5575,1.2042,3.5527,4.2805,4.5829,0.0561,2.9544,1.5452,0.8894,5.3871,0.5624,2.692,2.1638,3.6803,3.9337,2.7775,1.9561,1.6751,4.6276,0.0663,3.0674,0.7634,2.2092,2.5415,6.0579,0.405,0.7799,3.4788,0.4665,2.2979,2.2539,0.5071,5.7591,0.2478,1.4368,0.4416,0.0003,5.2018,2.0104,4.4132,3.2584,0.8618,3.4664,3.5304,4.0797,1.2372,2.6285,2.2553,0.4134,0.0123,2.6864,0.6096,1.5866]}

In the article, Dr. Koonin notes that the male feminist and feminist women are just not up to the task.\n\nWhen I watch porn I see lots of women taking pictures and videos of themselves, sometimes being nude, and some of them were with men. To this day, I am never able to find any way to explain the way a woman was allowed to take pictures of any one of those women. There's a large body of research that shows the same thing, which makes some feminists suspicious whether it's because of the way women are portrayed, or the fact that what they're doing, they believe, in a very big way to be a male role model.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think there may be some logic in this, as this is a way for feminists to show some women who are not women, even in positions of power, what they're not. On the other hand, one might also feel that this is also something that can only happen if these women are not male... So what if they aren't female, then what are they doing trying to do? I don't know, sort of.\n\nWhen a woman takes a picture, she can only take it as an actual face and for whatever reason, and she cannot go under the radar; she's going to have to pretend to be a woman for a good while so she makes up for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact that all the women are being photographed is simply a matter of whether or not the women are allowed to see their naked bodies.","token_len":402,"entropy":[10.1316,1.2055,6.3744,5.5126,11.2808,5.0514,5.8811,1.3332,9.5584,1.6291,0.2205,1.1797,5.0866,1.528,1.6007,1.8005,1.734,10.3019,2.2239,2.8576,9.0538,7.2727,1.6147,0.6178,12.4342,1.5383,4.1357,12.7319,0.9781,9.4849,5.9784,1.5114,5.6175,5.5344,11.1118,18.5935,0.1307,3.7395,8.4641,7.5064,2.9809,2.2553,1.1973,4.8683,4.8076,2.021,2.6172,1.3138,4.0483,0.9362,5.38,4.0577,3.8493,0.7139,2.9927,2.1448,3.8039,0.0341,2.5708,0.8029,0.0003,2.837,4.6484,4.9553,5.2517,0.107,5.2302,4.603,0.8992,4.1561,2.2506,0.0083,4.815,2.804,0.0917,5.0862,3.3967,3.1473,5.2279,5.4374,2.1189,4.172,4.8798,1.4195,4.4997,1.8124,3.6361,1.5459,1.7949,0.3501,1.0659,0.0053,0.2013,0.0025,0.0006,4.4868,0.3308,1.6946,3.3754,2.1841,5.0024,2.4031,3.8543,1.764,4.7429,3.2914,5.3916,0.3769,0.3819,0.6428,1.0071,1.8342,0.0003,5.0889,1.8752,5.161,5.8352,2.6239,2.593,4.9788,0.0591,2.0313,4.6855,2.5025,2.4574,3.7417,0.6676,1.2782,2.6102,4.5704,5.1981,4.9549,1.363,1.923,3.3528,0.8916,0.4326,5.6201,5.5705,3.093,0.8728,6.0796,4.659,0.0882,0.9692,1.2307,2.5287,3.8976,1.9629,0.003,2.0357,1.9793,4.8599,0.5309,2.9408,2.0935,3.3037,3.481,1.4876,4.2735,4.5095,0.1136,2.2208,1.3509,0.6762,6.5297,3.7035,1.2118,2.5883,1.9623,0.973,3.7528,2.4412,1.6515,5.6632,3.2177,0.0605,1.0629,1.1257,0.8841,3.5772,3.2358,0.4415,2.1401,3.4544,3.553,5.0358,2.0656,5.4411,6.817,2.3958,0.5983,1.8369,1.6148,1.1072,2.215,2.4399,0.6592,2.0118,1.6466,0.4345,2.2855,1.4794,0.0877,6.38,1.0072,1.3542,0.5605,4.2596,2.1034,5.5494,0.5881,5.08,2.4703,3.5805,4.6189,0.3665,3.0993,0.8831,2.7925,4.0187,2.7992,0.0285,0.4787,0.9111,0.0002,1.453,0.0032,0.0002,2.7046,2.2829,2.9219,4.6526,0.2156,1.3834,5.1457,1.8109,1.7722,1.3073,3.2159,4.3307,1.3455,1.2338,4.9743,1.4119,1.9339,0.1028,3.6782,3.743,3.8568,3.8621,0.7558,2.1445,4.3101,2.5728,3.8467,3.1538,5.5981,0.1688,0.1987,0.3654,3.3014,0.8302,1.9112,2.715,1.0984,6.1785,0.6956,0.5389,0.0495,0.0393,5.1326,3.0447,3.4535,4.7524,0.8816,2.5716,0.6836,5.1676,4.2747,0.9735,3.6454,3.0468,2.2519,2.103,4.4502,1.104,0.599,3.1844,5.3315,6.477,5.3976,3.5278,2.6941,1.9698,3.703,0.0008,2.7189,1.9923,3.3203,1.8321,2.7801,0.5551,0.9119,5.8372,0.0155,0.7119,0.6116,2.8823,1.72,0.0005,1.3652,1.7246,5.8975,0.0257,0.666,1.1847,0.0002,4.9586,3.352,1.5343,3.4541,0.7175,0.7019,2.1338,1.4919,3.5483,2.9575,1.7514,1.6902,2.9719,2.0903,5.6933,4.9385,2.6511,5.8889,3.7274,0.1603,1.0908,3.0228,2.2738,4.1906,4.5129,6.4252,0.6208,2.6419,6.1126,0.9335,1.909,3.7807,0.0836,2.0914,0.1796,5.0135,1.2187,0.1617,1.2259,1.701,3.4652,2.1725,5.0747,2.0221,4.6911,1.2441,6.6589,3.3462,2.4443,0.632,0.7131,1.7711,0.0002,1.2084,0.0023,0.0002,2.8798,3.7802,0.3358,4.4525,1.8161,1.781,1.7544,3.639,4.0567,1.3285,5.1057,1.8629,3.0372,0.0021,5.2554,1.0626,0.001,1.933,2.3936,0.5944,5.0164,0.1038,3.9499,3.4032,4.5786,0.4535,0.8405]}

It was first proposed in 1999 by astrophysicists John Matese, Patrick Whitman and Daniel Whitmire of the Florida State University in Jacksonville in the year 2000.\n\nIn the year 2015, NASA's Gaia satellite was deployed to collect images of the moon and the surface of the Earth in the solar system. With the spacecraft's new data, researchers found that these images were taken of Venus before it formed and thus the planet before it made a circular orbit around the sun.\n\n\"We've seen these things before. We have already seen them before. The problem is with the moon, with Venus. Everything that we could have seen would have made a crater like this, but our technology is such that we don't even need to know about it,\" Luthner said.\n\nA big improvement\n\nNASA is trying to solve the biggest challenge in its recent history, said the chief scientist at Gaia, David Schulz. As part of its research, the agency also has taken a major step forward by improving its vision for Mars.\n\nThey found that the Martian atmosphere was also able to provide a way for space stations to detect the presence of life on the alien planet and from there, potentially providing information for future studies of the planet's surface.\n\nThe technology, which will see NASA build a new lab there on Mars, is already being used to learn more about the Martian atmosphere and provide clues to the processes involved in the Martian sun's formation and expansion.\n\nAnd that's as clear-cut a breakthrough that can even help the United States and countries looking to avoid human-caused global warming.\n\n\"We have made a major breakthrough in using light from our space stations to discover new planets that we believe are at least as Earth-like as their surroundings,\" Schulz said. \"You could even go back in time and find extraterrestrial life. That's amazing.\"","token_len":405,"entropy":[8.5047,4.2696,2.7542,9.6189,8.1821,5.0768,3.6856,2.6583,5.3271,0.9551,1.3163,8.4919,0.9053,2.9763,5.0763,0.0633,3.4351,2.139,2.2798,1.9745,5.1257,3.0768,1.1277,4.2502,1.8526,5.1248,0.008,2.5811,0.0371,5.1158,4.9323,8.0714,6.6636,2.4127,5.9029,10.7534,0.5322,4.8947,6.9765,3.8942,3.7824,0.5858,6.3756,1.5059,0.0538,1.8795,3.265,4.8389,1.6727,6.1742,0.5651,0.317,1.1131,0.0008,3.3214,2.1409,2.9377,4.1169,0.1904,3.6426,1.8394,5.4171,1.1759,2.5515,3.543,0.6316,3.1955,3.149,0.2863,0.6245,4.0971,2.0316,2.066,3.8788,0.194,0.6942,3.1571,3.8442,1.2765,3.9166,0.0713,0.9886,5.6835,1.0995,4.2257,2.2665,4.0384,3.2373,0.4183,2.9089,3.5538,0.9625,4.7679,1.5358,1.5035,3.8549,4.6358,5.2583,5.9014,1.9006,3.8813,2.42,5.6106,3.0532,2.6023,6.1527,0.8697,4.9824,2.1321,4.8872,0.1369,0.1747,0.2762,0.7302,0.292,0.4715,0.0003,1.913,2.0469,2.7904,2.7948,3.8869,3.2137,0.5258,2.5798,1.4359,3.042,5.5183,0.6268,1.8442,2.1115,1.79,3.2231,4.6896,0.3988,4.9331,1.6471,4.8985,1.54,4.2013,2.3512,2.5863,6.1505,2.2051,1.1951,4.5726,2.7178,0.7864,4.7413,0.19,4.0883,1.4397,4.717,3.6611,1.3445,2.1099,1.8537,5.0542,5.6444,1.5057,5.7363,0.1042,0.9465,2.7346,0.0004,2.7867,2.5239,0.3902,2.2075,1.948,0.5883,0.5346,5.9818,5.3741,6.3291,0.2997,0.0898,0.3852,0.0002,4.3611,5.7426,6.1405,1.4037,0.0001,3.142,2.7545,4.4659,0.0619,4.0449,0.9764,4.6894,2.5085,2.499,3.0482,5.1187,2.6072,1.9118,3.6245,5.3173,4.2172,0.6711,1.6119,3.6961,0.6991,3.805,4.785,3.6823,0.4851,5.5091,2.0415,0.0009,0.9838,3.6502,0.7512,1.3526,0.2967,4.0665,2.8833,4.0212,1.1804,2.687,0.1884,1.63,1.8082,4.7781,1.2031,5.7308,1.5317,3.7974,0.9766,0.411,0.0002,6.3418,5.4378,0.5118,1.4372,5.1208,3.0995,2.4501,5.3621,4.0205,0.0009,3.3977,1.9032,4.3839,1.089,5.1019,3.1566,0.2535,3.9803,2.0878,0.6403,0.0223,0.9163,1.68,0.5588,5.2674,0.6376,3.0295,5.7809,1.64,1.595,5.1814,3.4455,3.4174,2.5412,1.2061,4.893,1.1891,1.1934,1.7262,1.1619,2.8386,0.5343,0.3213,0.0002,2.0975,5.142,2.5058,1.4088,3.0324,5.6336,2.9918,3.9351,1.2691,2.1063,5.6102,5.1598,3.7249,1.4489,1.01,1.4299,2.7803,1.43,1.0928,1.2712,5.3825,0.6862,0.0248,0.705,1.9793,0.9859,1.2188,5.2077,3.8501,1.1523,1.8571,5.5719,3.3406,0.3544,1.6227,3.6668,6.0462,1.6115,1.2651,1.1186,5.6216,0.3148,0.2963,0.0002,4.8366,3.8167,1.2166,6.1735,6.4337,1.9145,0.0441,0.7493,3.4675,4.4532,3.7931,5.4569,2.5277,2.5365,4.1558,0.0208,2.6285,6.058,4.2095,0.2828,5.4209,5.4532,0.9381,0.4556,0.0003,1.4292,0.0253,1.0533,0.2202,0.0002,0.7272,1.7696,2.2319,4.5187,1.4728,2.469,1.2288,1.0,5.3839,5.6486,1.76,3.3346,4.4138,1.8267,0.6712,4.6961,2.502,3.4029,2.3313,2.5043,3.909,1.5548,5.0906,1.2127,1.6068,3.2771,0.0673,0.3019,0.232,4.5809,3.5802,0.6736,0.75,0.0003,0.0451,0.0584,1.0428,5.1269,2.7949,2.9259,2.8461,1.0801,1.2777,0.0234,0.5932,1.8428,5.4835,0.1257,0.2417,2.1603,2.2104,0.5137,3.6512,0.8098]}

{"id":3377,"ended":true,"length":376,"gen_text":"Illmatic has also received notable attention from scholars and authors outside the music industry. Since its release, the album has become the subject of scholarship within academic and literary circles. In 2009, the Guardian reported that in the year since its debut, the album has sold more than five million copies and topped the charts on Amazon, and racked up a staggering 1 million in the U.S. market. As with recent releases, though, these numbers are not without critics. In January 2016, The New York Times' Laura White reported that in 2008 she had received hundreds of e-mails between her and the group that claimed to have reviewed The Gambler with the liner notes:\n\n\"I am so tired of talking about me and my album,\" says the 31-year-old actress, who says she is \"shocked\" by what she sees as a lack of discussion about her music. \"One person tells me, 'This band can't use any lyrics from your book and never release any.' \" White, who has written about her music and has been a part of the community since 2010, says she has also recently spoken to a group of artists about writing music and is working on her own new album.\n\nBlack Manta's work has garnered a lot of attention. In May, a record label named Black Manta released the album by The Black Manta Co., with the title \"The Beginning is the Beginning.\" At the time, White was not an official member of the band, but she's the only member of the group to make a public appearance on stage. As the New York Review of Books wrote, Black Manta will play three shows in the fall: the New York premiere of the album, then a spring tour in Seattle, Minnesota on April 21, and April 23 at the Grammys at the Warner Bros. Center in Los Angeles.\n\nThis article was reprinted with permission from the Anti-Media radio show.

This is the first major group of floating islands of the Sea of Ghosts in the United States. Halmahera is located on the south-central shore of the Antarctic Peninsula, about 70 miles southwest of New York.\n\nHalmahera is one of four floating islands of the Sea of Ghosts in the United States. It encompasses most of North America and Australia, while others include the southern island of North America. The island of Halmahera was one of only a few floating islands of North America on the surface of the Atlantic Ocean, with an average daily depth of 500 miles (1,500 km), with long length, broad shoreline and a narrow coast. These islands lie nearly 6 inches deep (13 m), but are found nowhere else, and are accessible only by boat. As part of its research, the Sea of Ghosts used artificial gravity to extend its length during the 1960s and 1970s. It was the first floating island of the sea of Ghosts on the surface of the Atlantic Ocean, with its length of about 575 miles (860 km.) (Kierling, 1986). The Island of Halmahera, which is located on the south-central shore of the Antarctic Peninsula, had been abandoned by the Great Pyrenees and built as a shelter by Native Americans. The Sea of Ghosts was renamed Halmahera at the end of the 20th century. It was designated the National Landmark by the Council of Landmarks in 2004. Currently, it is the only place in the world the Sea of Ghosts can be seen and explored. It has also long been an important and well-preserved place in the sea.\n\nThe Island of Halmahera, where the Sea of Ghosts lives.\n\nSee also:\n\nReferences","token_len":410,"entropy":[10.9898,10.855,7.2483,6.6087,5.7364,0.4951,3.8296,15.3436,2.0056,4.8779,0.9167,3.1307,13.5764,4.1519,3.7644,16.8779,6.8151,9.617,9.4024,8.1922,10.0261,5.5081,4.7028,2.1548,4.6595,1.6456,5.6767,9.5758,0.6733,3.6098,1.9068,1.8026,10.5474,0.1941,1.2704,4.9023,1.0493,7.8351,5.0618,7.7091,0.2831,2.738,4.7661,1.1513,2.1519,4.9537,3.4447,0.3626,3.3493,2.6722,1.4877,2.4768,5.3804,5.5417,0.2913,4.0114,3.3008,3.4852,1.0706,5.7843,0.6924,3.7268,2.878,0.6675,4.7233,0.0194,0.749,6.2007,0.0245,0.0007,0.0041,0.743,2.9971,2.0799,0.6274,3.3537,2.7814,2.0467,2.9983,0.0828,0.7795,5.7165,0.5778,1.2845,2.5227,4.1894,0.5472,2.49,0.0365,3.0298,0.2794,2.0072,2.4071,0.0045,3.2711,0.0257,0.0013,0.0039,0.7816,2.6463,0.0068,3.6565,2.0701,0.1491,1.9464,0.4105,0.7305,0.0478,0.0051,1.9689,0.3662,0.3832,0.0028,0.6302,1.8759,5.6033,4.4861,0.0544,2.0774,0.0677,1.3267,4.0085,0.9232,4.2985,3.975,1.1119,1.3679,4.1797,4.5672,0.1505,4.2768,1.0895,1.878,1.4871,2.5819,1.2148,0.6183,0.0126,0.0019,0.0022,3.0529,4.1268,0.0067,2.6721,1.9586,0.6376,1.39,0.1128,1.2658,4.1629,0.0462,3.9311,1.009,3.4785,0.294,0.3189,3.7304,0.3591,2.012,3.1442,3.1151,1.5716,4.8843,3.5749,0.0523,5.1961,3.1516,1.2025,0.3839,0.0641,2.5322,0.5181,1.7783,3.0459,6.3136,5.3658,3.8443,4.5629,3.2933,0.6393,1.433,2.3114,3.5677,4.7183,0.6021,5.5625,1.0275,5.0355,5.3133,4.61,5.3998,2.8419,2.3801,4.874,3.414,1.7115,3.4273,1.6241,4.9421,6.1868,0.2587,4.2608,1.6371,1.2045,5.5092,0.7528,0.4318,1.3741,0.8341,5.1439,4.3616,0.0008,1.7231,4.9011,0.7648,1.1671,4.023,0.1602,0.0033,5.4334,5.4282,2.2772,0.5493,5.4193,1.028,1.6761,5.5927,1.0676,4.6208,0.0846,1.0205,0.3227,0.0002,0.8038,3.1205,1.4379,3.4084,0.9726,1.0611,0.3961,1.1088,0.6038,2.9129,2.3284,0.9806,3.0001,0.673,1.5118,0.1134,0.1249,0.6893,0.3892,1.2627,2.5089,2.7956,2.3612,1.7486,3.3293,3.3275,5.1413,0.8059,0.133,5.3916,0.0214,5.7503,2.5282,4.9534,5.6243,5.3979,0.657,4.3706,0.4687,2.0404,3.39,0.2499,0.2505,0.0031,0.0005,0.001,2.991,2.44,1.0949,2.4672,1.5189,0.4915,1.9807,0.4115,0.0902,0.2597,0.0314,0.2677,0.2475,0.0075,0.1594,4.9028,2.2719,5.3509,1.17,0.6716,5.0998,5.272,0.3723,0.0008,2.654,5.6922,1.8487,0.2631,4.0966,2.5839,5.9125,0.245,1.7555,1.7421,4.8715,0.0178,0.0071,1.4275,4.8804,2.6848,0.0676,0.004,0.008,4.6212,0.5697,1.47,0.0016,0.3521,2.2922,0.0039,0.104,1.2352,2.6858,1.4876,3.7947,1.7498,3.9772,3.7172,0.8551,1.0925,0.3822,5.8784,0.4845,3.9122,1.3952,0.9144,4.7747,0.6921,6.6823,0.3005,1.8933,0.456,2.0805,0.5219,5.5896,1.2532,0.4787,0.5923,6.0991,1.9751,0.0204,0.01,0.9788,0.1599,0.5431,3.0759,2.7717,0.7402,3.0174,2.3608,3.8052,5.7088,0.2477,3.8762,2.0118,3.6603,4.4205,0.3929,2.1193,0.0014,3.7486,1.6035,0.7367,5.1105,1.7851,1.0136,0.0002,1.7301,2.353,0.0716,0.143,0.0022,0.0004,0.0013,2.6032,4.7615,1.3266,2.6617,0.028,0.008,4.4287,2.0548,1.3142,0.0002,5.6784,0.678,1.5046,1.3809,0.0002,2.0045]}
{"id":369,"ended":false,"length":362,"gen_text":"Both Rachel and Aniston have become fashion icons due to their combined influence on womenswear during the 1990s and onwards, particularly among British women. According to Vogue magazine's Edward Barsamian, Rachel \"is one of the only current female fashion major to be able to pull off a big-name modeling contract with Bambi. She was born to a 'womenswear queen',\" she wrote.Rachel's other recent modeling work is with Max B\u00e9k\u00e9, who is now known as The Man.\n\nIt is reported that Rachel, who has reportedly been at the helm of her brand since 2005, was inspired by the famous nude model of the 1980s, The L.A. Times reports;\n\nIt would be interesting to see Rachel go beyond modeling with such a powerful talent. If any one of her modeling abilities remains with us, it is probably that she has no fear of her former modeling friends.\n\nThis, of course, indicates that some fashionistas and artists are not as happy with Rachel, and that she has not addressed the issue, but rather, made some of the comments about it in her article. Rachel's statements in this article include this:\n\nBam! Not a model, not one of Bopi's fans, but you can be sure that your next appearance will be one of Bopi's! There will be a great deal of coverage of what will prove to be a 'womenswear queen'\" (as reported by The Guardian).\n\nShe also commented on how \"you'll be seeing a lot of Bopi girls on the runway wearing these pants, and you'll notice them very differently from the other girls you see at conventions \u2026 because they have no clothes.\"\n\nI am not sure if this sentiment makes sense for Rachel but seems to be the norm when it comes to Bopi.\n\nWhat do you think of Rachel's comments in her article? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nSource (1)","token_len":411,"entropy":[11.4493,0.6755,7.4787,5.334,2.4523,4.1462,8.7616,0.7971,5.3197,0.0253,0.2941,6.3246,4.7704,1.0594,7.9784,0.0142,0.1102,6.6532,0.6916,2.7778,0.0805,1.0889,7.5897,1.8513,4.5097,3.9224,4.9909,1.1901,0.8591,5.8114,0.0009,7.1913,0.0701,2.8828,2.9497,10.6526,10.4126,2.9185,0.5209,0.4787,3.6819,2.5257,1.8861,2.3366,0.0351,0.2756,4.2675,5.7221,3.5126,1.717,6.001,1.5971,2.6931,3.968,0.0102,4.0885,0.3433,1.0781,4.1246,2.4567,1.3073,5.9191,3.1742,2.2289,5.7821,5.0288,0.1992,2.5095,1.891,2.8291,3.9023,3.1823,1.8259,5.8282,4.3297,0.4566,0.0046,0.2049,3.569,2.7981,2.1249,2.4303,0.6409,7.7126,1.6534,5.3346,4.3004,2.4377,1.7058,2.51,2.7144,6.0429,4.7915,5.3901,4.6754,2.4084,0.7418,1.2968,2.3014,2.9651,3.8699,0.6471,3.6828,5.5081,2.4427,2.5455,0.0017,4.8668,1.3548,4.2885,0.1421,2.1241,3.1587,0.7028,2.0253,5.2263,1.3342,5.0783,0.8121,1.9799,0.1531,2.6848,4.2098,0.8649,3.3058,0.1049,2.6997,3.3907,0.5824,1.7341,5.0707,5.6054,1.3289,3.9849,2.0925,3.3536,0.0301,1.345,5.3813,5.0035,3.667,0.0624,0.0689,1.9268,1.5021,5.9534,2.4583,0.0002,4.5664,3.9815,0.9935,3.3604,0.0434,0.5818,3.3078,4.2014,4.1506,2.6488,3.3627,4.994,1.51,3.7837,5.9253,1.0515,3.8338,5.3398,3.4441,0.8458,1.1787,3.2405,5.8858,5.5682,5.8139,1.8818,0.3014,0.4848,1.4918,2.9811,1.9937,0.972,2.6665,3.5574,4.9864,0.1951,4.2115,4.2492,3.8986,5.6394,1.3823,1.7986,0.0003,4.0582,4.1205,1.1401,0.002,0.0085,6.1452,0.2358,5.0616,3.8526,2.5804,3.9772,5.2358,1.4214,3.1418,2.9141,4.6344,0.4813,1.9788,3.4378,2.1899,1.6558,1.8452,2.121,2.9777,5.7608,1.2875,0.9524,3.8095,2.7118,1.1172,2.6351,5.3826,2.8928,3.6963,1.6382,2.5467,2.5501,2.9783,2.1567,1.6593,4.7196,0.5284,3.955,1.758,5.0015,3.6889,2.2029,0.5732,5.2397,3.4293,0.7621,0.2497,0.0002,5.9436,4.7654,4.8732,5.5887,2.8065,4.3806,1.8483,2.1088,4.2768,0.5682,4.1939,8.1624,4.4268,0.5856,5.4626,1.1725,1.9873,5.1346,3.2448,3.3771,0.969,0.9975,5.2671,5.5362,5.2215,0.9646,0.4423,4.0774,0.3396,3.3366,0.3502,0.0068,0.1703,3.3442,5.315,2.3996,0.2586,1.9689,4.9489,1.17,0.1697,5.7431,1.5147,4.0193,3.9151,6.3981,0.181,0.0206,0.9013,5.5084,3.9106,0.0488,0.0021,0.0205,0.9712,5.5236,2.7961,5.1802,3.1979,0.4489,2.4249,3.2509,1.0014,0.7571,0.0003,3.8767,1.1821,3.2914,0.9132,3.0438,2.3997,4.5947,3.354,1.7313,2.6612,1.9742,0.3672,0.6658,3.6853,0.0852,0.0149,5.1177,3.117,1.5757,0.5859,3.2579,4.8411,4.6042,1.7718,1.5897,2.6635,0.5198,4.673,3.3909,5.221,3.5683,1.8937,1.4251,2.2588,1.3262,3.9064,1.0149,3.1391,5.8562,6.1806,4.4997,1.5638,2.5783,3.5682,3.3641,2.2596,0.6232,0.0002,3.7772,3.0922,1.6296,1.2053,1.5349,1.1448,5.7134,5.3289,0.701,3.342,2.7528,4.7768,6.414,0.6351,1.1906,2.7557,4.5854,3.768,0.2974,0.0098,0.0045,3.3734,0.1356,0.012,1.2258,1.7768,0.0002,3.9907,0.6345,0.0421,0.0575,1.3586,1.1236,0.3538,0.9148,2.1258,1.9405,0.235,0.1614,2.2763,0.1292,0.0037,0.4318,0.008,0.0767,0.467,1.208,0.6754,0.0003,2.9447,2.4562,0.0515,0.2602]}
{"id":209,"ended":true,"length":372,"gen_text":"The best hockey players on their high school team, Ross and the Patrick brothers were invited to play occasional games for local league teams in Montreal. Ross first played in an organized league in 1987 and has played in the Stanley Cup Playoffs six times. During his professional career he amassed 725 points (9g-24a) and has earned three Olympic gold medals. The brothers played hockey for the Detroit Red Wings in 1988.\n\nRoss was selected to play junior college hockey and is currently playing for the Boston University Red Wings in hockey, hockey modeling and video modelling. His father, Eric Ross Sr., was a professional hockey coach who coached Ross with the Blue Angels of Michigan.\n\nA favorite of NHL scouts on TV for years, Ross is the second top-ranked player on hockey's best prospects list, after last year's draft pick, Connor McDavid. Although the Leafs have signed players like Brendan Eichel and Tyler Fabbri, who both were selected in the first round by the Leafs on Friday, there is no official word about the Bruins GM who has yet to announce his hiring.\n\nRoss recently served as a scout for the Chicago Blackhawks in their regular season opener. He spent some time coaching college players last season.\n\nRoss is a former NHL goalie who won two Stanley Cups in 1999 and 2000. His brother, Ross Sr., was two years into his junior college career then moved to the NHL. At 6-foot-4, Ross and his wife Nicole were married in 2008.\n\nRoss spent a year with the St. Louis Blues as they watched James van Riemsdyk, the team's second goalie, become the first goaltender in franchise history to complete 40 games after he entered the league. The Blues had 10 players on their final roster in April. On Thursday, they announced the signings of Tyler Purcell, the team's fourth-round pick of 2011.\n\nFollow @YahooGM_Follow on Twitter to keep up with all the latest NHL news.

{"id":2274,"ended":false,"length":372,"gen_text":"McCain's early military career began when he was commissioned an ensign and started two and a half years of training at Pensacola to become a naval aviator. While there, he earned a master's degree in aircraft design and aviation engineering from the Naval War College at Pensacola. He graduated with a BFA in aviation engineering and was assigned to the Army to work on aviation operations as part of the Warfighter Team.\n\n\"With this training, [McCain] was able to make the jump from flying a little on the high end to becoming a flight instructor and then flying planes for a significant portion of his career,\" said Benoit. \"This has been a difficult thing to do because you have to take on a lot of different projects to develop, with different requirements, and what we've learned is that you have to know what you're making.\"\n\nMcCain completed five military career hours with the Navy's U.S. Navy Reconnaissance Services division, and two missions with the Air Force's Air Force Reconnaissance Services. He also has taken active duty at the Navy's Joint Base at Yokosuka and served in the Marine Corps in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe mission for McCain in 2008 was to study aerodynamics.\n\n\"To me, there was no physical proof of where the legs might be. I did research on the wingtips so I could evaluate the way the system moved under the conditions. At the time there was no specific type of research to pursue, so I did focus the work on how the two muscles connected to the wings operate as they did under gravity -- that's where I spent the last two years traveling,\" McCain said.\n\nMcCain also served as Naval Air Station Commander for the Persian Gulf War from 2007 to 2009, as well as Commander of the Naval Oceanic Systems Command, a position where Air Force Air Force Base Tampa Bay is located.\n\nFollow @BenoitDC\n\nPHOTOS: World War II Air Combat Events - by Matt Wroblewski","token_len":412,"entropy":[6.9928,1.8253,7.464,8.4333,0.819,3.3016,2.4953,0.1893,0.9742,4.5695,4.4873,6.2717,0.0006,3.5488,7.0,6.4754,7.0405,0.0605,0.0025,0.1738,2.6885,3.963,2.0665,8.0224,0.0099,0.0001,6.1899,1.8174,0.581,2.9347,3.7668,0.0149,0.4404,4.2997,2.2911,0.3915,0.2064,3.9158,1.0004,1.8407,0.0253,0.0888,0.2014,5.5872,2.9258,1.2174,4.6274,0.9776,0.8204,0.8325,1.4889,1.1685,0.0038,2.524,2.7929,0.0002,0.0018,0.7815,1.4664,3.4459,1.2735,0.4968,2.5519,4.6855,0.2237,2.4553,0.7028,1.6481,2.6719,3.2316,0.1046,0.748,3.9386,5.6704,2.3719,1.0088,4.9584,2.19,4.072,3.3832,0.0021,0.5697,5.3842,3.5852,4.6222,0.8206,1.5797,0.0039,4.1617,5.1683,3.6571,4.716,0.7619,5.4842,3.1948,0.0015,0.0545,1.913,0.3439,0.0033,4.2153,1.9605,3.026,1.0017,3.4678,1.7929,5.335,6.0671,1.0522,5.4481,0.9738,0.6549,2.6941,0.6985,4.3117,1.3804,1.6739,3.4562,2.9598,5.0863,2.2438,1.7279,5.8743,2.6004,0.0036,0.1903,0.3263,0.3937,0.7212,5.592,4.4867,0.9567,0.1943,3.383,3.5581,0.8534,0.7808,4.8987,4.6336,1.563,1.0942,2.8675,2.4395,1.6839,0.3566,3.4464,2.3774,1.3838,0.7196,0.0447,1.7551,4.3354,3.5906,4.2918,3.0638,5.586,2.1685,4.7322,1.0142,1.3118,5.4266,2.7746,1.7795,1.4979,1.969,0.5121,1.4607,1.3131,0.0284,4.6309,1.3335,0.3908,0.4169,4.8215,2.141,0.0958,0.0002,1.1815,0.0012,4.4895,5.0814,4.7056,3.9007,4.2946,3.3988,0.8488,1.5041,1.8977,5.3098,0.1096,0.0043,0.003,2.2103,4.879,0.08,5.5945,5.2107,1.4918,2.1701,3.3992,5.8018,0.8696,0.3172,1.7744,0.1474,0.3213,2.6559,1.273,1.3579,0.0006,3.7112,2.082,1.0242,1.5915,5.1018,5.841,4.5768,0.2144,3.9225,1.0991,3.3001,0.8131,2.3491,1.8114,4.3409,2.5243,0.4151,0.0001,1.497,1.7307,1.2094,0.9882,2.8217,0.0549,4.563,1.985,1.4918,0.1745,0.3016,0.4359,0.0002,3.4148,5.8218,3.135,0.8354,3.2878,4.6076,0.5046,0.3948,4.9236,4.8565,1.176,3.2537,2.4164,0.0002,0.3954,5.0208,2.8493,0.3982,3.9043,2.1785,1.6562,5.7303,5.2901,1.7183,5.445,2.0492,5.7207,5.4437,0.9357,2.9855,1.5441,4.0117,4.7618,1.6871,1.4258,4.2747,3.8962,4.5356,0.7404,0.4083,4.899,1.12,5.0839,1.2063,5.4205,5.8165,4.6589,0.8902,4.4383,2.5785,5.0458,0.7306,0.6416,4.3395,0.5988,0.8411,4.7911,4.9971,0.0688,4.4193,2.7956,5.4294,1.4917,1.5283,0.5968,3.294,5.5937,6.0542,2.8898,0.4444,3.1855,1.0847,6.0148,4.7187,4.5072,1.3108,0.3129,2.6757,5.9313,4.3811,2.0623,4.2359,1.4344,5.3538,6.2142,3.0886,1.2873,2.2039,1.3717,3.9658,1.1848,2.644,1.943,0.2638,6.6237,2.0565,2.32,0.1976,0.0816,0.5927,0.0002,0.8082,0.0002,2.4772,3.8978,0.7234,6.3933,2.6743,0.9203,3.378,1.8751,1.4477,4.5784,0.0005,1.7336,1.611,3.1096,0.7973,1.1876,1.3932,3.4759,1.1503,0.0047,3.8425,0.3491,0.8615,2.5189,4.9346,3.0594,5.2902,0.348,2.2794,3.1556,1.7924,3.4609,7.5357,0.1789,3.9681,0.9648,4.0383,4.8041,3.8788,2.5549,0.3394,0.171,0.6566,0.0001,5.5195,1.3958,4.9474,0.0655,4.8911,2.1117,0.0002,4.9876,0.1818,5.1045,1.5777,0.1981,3.6041,3.8728,5.4122,4.4642,5.3602,4.8235,5.1617,5.6385,0.5689,0.0016,0.0036]}
{"id":3095,"ended":true,"length":389,"gen_text":"In October 2013, Marvel and Disney announced that they would provide Netflix with live action series centered around Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage, leading up to a final Netflix streaming event in spring 2014. The series will be available to stream on Netflix for around $25 per second. Netflix did also announce a partnership to provide original series to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well, but there have thus far been no original casting announcements for Daredevil, Jessica Jones, and Luke Cage during the live-action announcement. Netflix announced that it will begin giving fans the chance to add their own characters to new titles, such as The Walking Dead with Dan Quinn, The Punisher with Jon Bernthal, and Marvel's Agents of SHIELD with Jessica Jones & Anthony Mackie. The series will include stories by writer\/artist Dan Slott, who also wrote the screenplay for the upcoming series, Jessica Jones: New Blood, and creator\/producer John Jenkins, who is also a big fan of the comics. Netflix, however, has a problem with the series, as it will show some of the series' early versions in a more generic format. Netflix has also stated that the first episodes will not feature some new details, like who is involved, where or why, but there were no official announcement of where the stories might come from. When asked if they plan to show new episodes, the showrunners emphasized that they do not plan to.\n\nMarvel has not confirmed any of the Marvel comics that will debut in the series at any point in time. They have already announced series such as Avengers: Infinity War and Spider-Woman, and two will premiere in next year's film.\n\nIt is not clear if, and only if the Marvel Cinematic Universe will be a partnership. It would also be very surprising at the beginning when the Netflix stream in the first few weeks of September when each show will receive the same rights.\n\nMarvel Television will also host the upcoming Agents of SHIELD (2017), which will return to Marvel in 2018.","token_len":412,"entropy":[8.1794,2.9196,0.1668,8.1551,4.022,3.0261,1.3896,1.1571,1.2284,1.227,6.7214,6.6595,0.5016,6.5292,3.353,3.1717,7.1614,0.782,5.372,1.1549,2.0578,0.0019,0.3953,2.3233,0.0033,0.5676,1.6784,0.9073,0.0003,2.0209,7.2374,2.0727,0.0045,3.0954,5.3289,5.0853,5.8147,1.8809,1.397,6.403,0.4025,0.1271,2.1801,1.4806,1.2114,1.5449,2.697,1.8521,0.6993,1.0783,0.7397,3.0106,4.394,0.3781,3.438,1.4961,6.8073,1.3132,3.3642,4.4089,6.1665,1.4936,2.1196,2.4234,4.5729,2.3064,3.7265,0.8178,1.5911,2.1947,2.8437,0.4148,0.0022,0.0004,4.1067,0.9848,1.569,3.5225,3.8707,2.7599,8.43,0.1634,0.3395,0.4282,6.1855,6.2808,0.1649,1.233,2.5069,1.1243,0.623,0.0098,0.0358,1.7998,0.1194,0.0015,7.1582,1.2334,4.3783,1.2166,0.0007,5.264,0.6199,3.9043,3.7666,1.3035,1.2099,1.1861,3.3766,5.8271,2.8044,1.8073,1.6818,0.0368,4.5115,1.1678,0.8135,2.29,0.5943,7.0889,4.9331,2.2676,3.1409,0.0011,2.717,3.1105,0.0017,6.1234,4.3234,4.0854,0.716,1.6777,3.3881,0.0001,0.7498,5.1444,0.0033,0.0,0.1149,0.8636,5.0223,0.2948,0.925,0.0382,1.7394,0.0,0.9717,2.7228,0.0411,7.1514,5.6576,0.2025,0.0,0.363,2.2827,1.4724,0.4952,4.7304,5.5117,1.7187,4.0377,1.6229,2.7015,4.3297,1.0374,0.0003,0.3443,2.5318,1.471,2.1193,1.142,4.675,0.3073,1.3919,2.8673,3.4611,1.2233,4.4707,0.1787,0.8211,5.2639,2.567,1.2952,0.8633,4.643,1.8625,2.1126,0.0014,4.7057,6.0438,1.617,0.2992,2.072,1.0099,2.3822,4.0101,0.464,0.0247,1.0674,3.0738,0.6331,3.3819,4.2016,2.0858,0.0065,1.1552,5.4647,4.3161,0.5941,1.8661,3.1002,1.8214,1.0886,1.1162,3.515,5.4132,5.5339,0.7498,0.3228,4.5033,0.6155,4.8186,5.7007,2.7415,1.6152,3.4327,5.6446,2.7146,0.9032,2.9981,1.4725,2.0753,2.9216,0.1681,1.9526,3.5485,3.2932,0.9575,1.8866,2.0658,5.4072,3.133,5.5441,1.428,3.8249,4.1503,2.0843,3.0003,1.8379,3.2025,4.0237,2.7127,3.3164,0.9779,3.6494,4.2349,2.0248,2.4883,3.2767,1.4687,4.3695,1.0704,4.2419,4.0688,2.8224,0.0089,0.4423,5.5411,0.776,1.4217,2.1847,3.5422,0.2463,3.6117,2.7723,1.5547,1.5799,2.7357,2.5294,1.6346,5.4551,0.2567,0.8969,3.2937,0.2879,1.2753,0.3152,2.0006,1.7206,0.002,2.8624,1.8775,3.1089,2.5108,1.7689,1.8732,0.4395,3.8624,4.9265,2.8722,0.7478,3.3943,1.1354,1.1424,2.1658,4.4077,2.5669,0.584,1.0345,1.2218,0.5669,4.025,1.1273,3.1829,1.5211,6.0649,1.7173,0.0009,2.7924,0.3173,0.7236,0.0014,1.7428,3.6694,0.0207,3.916,1.0259,1.6665,5.4966,4.8193,3.1674,0.9889,5.6765,0.2807,0.109,5.0179,1.1768,1.7926,0.0002,4.6121,1.2418,2.0174,1.2328,1.2228,6.0203,3.8027,4.5172,0.167,5.4557,2.0282,2.2515,0.0016,0.0016,0.4268,1.4803,2.9573,5.785,2.0405,3.0447,2.7644,2.8703,0.5274,3.6849,3.4017,6.3698,1.9679,4.2212,4.0264,2.1954,4.2964,5.0581,4.9959,2.4446,1.4172,2.4013,1.1962,0.3958,4.316,4.8396,6.0315,2.0556,0.9381,5.0294,3.2056,0.7167,5.1073,2.1161,2.003,0.0003,2.7012,5.2426,2.3915,2.1666,4.5244,1.9813,3.6087,4.8146,0.0922,0.1215,0.0001,4.9792,4.0882,1.0949,1.3382,0.6863,4.9461,0.6665,2.7709,3.2793,0.9923,0.5257]}

{"id":3512,"ended":false,"length":356,"gen_text":"The outbreak was the third instance of H5N1 detected in the United Kingdom. The first outbreak occurred in October 2005 among exotic birds imported from Taiwan and South America at a privately owned quarantine facility in North London. This outbreak was followed by six others between February and September 2006 involving around 7,000 birds imported from China.\n\nThe H5N1 case in the United Kingdom\n\nThis outbreak occurred on 16 October 2004.\n\nOn 15 October 2004, the H5N1 was detected in a flock in the west-west corner of Kent Street, west London. The flock were taken to the Royal Veterinary Hospital after being confirmed by laboratory testing. Following further testing, the bird was confirmed to have a H5N1 infection. The hen arrived to see if there was normal H5 RNA in her chicken, but no H5P2 activity was detected in another flock. Upon examination, the H5P2 activity in its chicken was confirmed to be from H5 and H1E2. As part of its routine poultry collection, the hen examined H5 eggs, so it could identify the infectious bird.\n\nOn 2 November 2004, the same flock was tested for H5P2 in a flock in Walthamstow, Essex. The flock was taken to the Royal Veterinary Hospital where they were confirmed to have H5 RNA, which was found in the poultry.\n\nThe next outbreak took place on 2 February 2005. On the same day, another outbreak occurred in Yorkshire, due to the H5 vaccine being supplied to local people. The incident caused about 10 birds to be poisoned with the H35 virus virus and killed at least 5 birds. At least 4 others were injured using the H35 vaccine caused by the H5 virus virus on 7 March 2005.\n\nThe poultry farms of Sheffield and Hinton, Yorkshire were in the process of building a quarantine facility for H5 vaccine manufacturers, where an international chicken quarantine agreement will be developed.\n\nMore details concerning the outbreak can be found here.\n\nReferences","token_len":414,"entropy":[10.7297,2.3679,3.1462,2.5914,8.2981,0.3811,7.0388,3.1332,0.0017,0.3218,7.3049,0.5673,1.5926,1.8182,4.0664,2.8286,2.0881,1.3191,3.3753,1.741,0.2762,3.3235,4.2189,7.3352,10.8959,2.6255,5.3024,0.267,4.8965,1.755,4.7705,3.0552,5.8597,1.3486,7.982,0.7977,4.6734,0.698,1.1685,4.9975,2.9832,0.3876,3.7818,1.037,1.1784,2.7666,0.1554,5.5734,2.7429,2.5189,2.8176,0.704,2.1359,1.587,5.7573,5.678,4.5118,0.6322,0.5658,1.0097,2.3761,0.1943,1.9287,1.3811,1.1084,0.0006,1.7712,2.557,0.0419,0.0051,0.0209,4.5804,3.1469,1.2448,0.5127,0.048,5.7936,0.0002,3.6212,0.9434,2.1561,2.1429,3.932,1.6073,2.7396,2.1417,2.7926,0.0002,3.682,3.1697,0.8662,0.6409,0.3789,1.9386,1.9958,0.0155,0.0037,0.0047,2.8555,1.8301,0.6524,1.8317,2.8848,3.7851,1.8575,5.6756,2.7565,1.4256,2.9169,0.0106,5.1338,4.7524,1.3859,4.5679,1.0276,0.6473,1.3033,1.5251,6.1837,4.4841,0.5219,1.4242,2.2749,0.6815,1.4017,5.6281,1.7127,3.3497,2.0314,3.7571,2.0554,0.7945,5.3788,3.1708,1.1497,0.45,0.7711,3.4162,0.2846,1.5043,0.3446,0.8669,2.8577,1.5281,0.0488,0.0123,0.024,2.6325,0.493,1.7786,5.9021,5.2586,2.8398,4.3821,1.2077,2.3818,0.4664,7.3838,2.22,0.0326,9.3209,0.456,1.6973,4.7914,1.9723,0.9974,2.5657,1.3526,0.0135,5.3859,2.8505,5.9475,0.585,0.4358,1.7842,8.0098,1.1017,0.58,4.8386,2.6004,0.7258,0.8626,2.7728,0.0073,1.2897,0.0241,2.4485,2.0976,6.9471,2.9244,0.5447,2.1913,0.4848,0.1587,4.0794,0.968,0.0502,5.6234,1.6203,4.0943,5.9037,2.1643,1.0744,5.0467,3.8223,0.0006,1.8411,3.1836,4.2832,3.648,0.5015,0.6179,1.1986,3.8267,5.0223,0.1334,4.1592,2.6858,5.5309,2.8413,0.8841,2.7054,1.2564,5.6868,3.2499,0.725,1.2896,0.0001,1.2843,3.499,0.733,0.3363,0.1254,0.9726,3.672,2.4453,0.5544,3.6537,1.0492,0.2001,0.0194,2.201,0.0499,1.9619,1.3787,1.0624,1.0814,5.0004,1.6431,0.0018,0.5181,0.0009,1.0592,2.9515,0.4764,1.0652,2.9347,0.5812,1.4044,0.1906,0.3573,0.4123,0.0266,0.0727,2.8027,2.308,0.262,0.3159,0.1384,0.305,0.5136,0.0237,2.1511,3.304,2.5011,0.9276,2.5933,1.067,1.1258,3.9835,0.4187,1.6912,0.0001,1.8545,2.5805,3.0911,3.27,0.0028,0.7442,3.1699,2.5134,0.3047,1.1676,2.3629,4.4564,0.4973,0.1641,0.3543,2.9656,4.9249,1.3957,0.4992,4.9685,1.4045,5.9574,0.0309,1.8592,2.6848,0.0294,6.4859,0.8821,4.4023,0.6772,4.4187,4.1944,0.7303,1.7169,5.296,4.372,4.2154,3.4162,1.9337,0.2954,0.5935,5.6758,1.9053,1.6911,0.6977,9.8708,2.8333,6.845,2.278,3.9976,3.4377,0.0113,3.7246,1.0942,0.4736,5.2206,1.3218,3.3674,2.9726,0.7379,1.8534,7.24,0.9587,0.9776,0.3212,0.3284,6.5121,0.0613,0.9104,0.6817,0.0911,2.0875,2.1615,5.4235,3.8746,2.0834,0.2997,0.3319,0.6337,0.0001,1.1767,5.9412,5.604,2.7186,5.0022,0.6763,4.4923,5.0967,2.0755,2.7648,1.708,4.2477,1.3691,1.0568,0.0028,5.0498,0.8677,2.5781,1.2568,1.5644,0.8809,0.0541,4.1053,4.6656,2.5703,4.679,4.5822,4.7611,5.4514,3.8379,4.1061,4.4412,0.3096,4.1027,0.7173,1.1433,0.0002,5.2705,2.9018,5.2962,0.606,1.5364,1.5005,0.0047,0.0859,2.045,0.5963,0.418,0.0002,2.8974]}

Drew, who had been elected PC leader in 1948 over Saskatchewan MP John Diefenbaker. Drew was then re-elected in 1953 and played a major role in the formation of the Liberals in 1958.\n\nIn the second half of 1954, when Liberal MP Thomas L. Rokdale returned as mayor of Toronto following a four-year stint as mayor of Vancouver, Rokdale assumed control and became the new leader.\n\nIn 1963, Wynne, then serving as cabinet minister and then governor-general of Ontario, was elected premier after being elected premier of Ontario from 1969 to 1981. Thereafter the Progressive Conservatives replaced Progressive Conservative Leader Jacques Rogge as premier.\n\nBy 1983, the Liberals had been led by Doug Ford, later Canada's prime minister, who was forced out of government after five years in office after becoming the son of a union executive member. Ford's Liberal party then came to power and campaigned for Ford, who eventually won the province's second presidential election.\n\nIn 1986, during the second world war, the Conservative government of the day in Britain seized power and began to govern for four straight decades.\n\nIn 1974, after the war ended, when former Conservative government minister David Clark began his political career, Clark was appointed mayor of Toronto, which was then controlled by the National Post.

{"id":3389,"ended":true,"length":375,"gen_text":"During the 1890s, Leno was the leading performer on the music hall stage, rivalled only by Albert Chevalier, who moved into music hall from the legitimate theatre. Their styles and appeal combined with their high skill in the way they played produced a formidable show.\n\nThe audience did not see them as the type of performers who could make a great play that would be played by a group of enthusiastic but highly motivated folk musicians.\n\nHowever, during times when the group was very well organised and had a well-defined and organized audience, it still felt like a large circus-like spectacle.\n\nToday's music halls have changed this. On the other hand, the music hall theatre still has a reputation as one of the most popular music halls.\n\nThe stage also has a new type of theatre, a more contemporary form with a large screen and a small orchestra.\n\nOne of the main reasons was the huge popularity of classical music, especially the greats such as J.E.B. Bach, and the pianists such as Paul McCartney.\n\nHowever, some of the key elements of popular music today may still be not in line with the spirit of the times.\n\nMusic lovers are still not aware of the changing musical styles from when they were very young.\n\nTheir new way of listening continues. When they sit, their eyes see different music, and their ears see different songs...\n\nThey are just more aware of their surroundings and are more engaged with what is happening today.\n\nWe are in a place where there is no reason to expect the past to change.\n\nThe music of tomorrow will still be a place that shows no signs of fading from memory - no old mistakes and no problems.\n\nWe continue to live in a time when the present is becoming more and more a present of the past, a present in which there isn't a future for the past.\n\nIn that light, we will continue to listen for the past, the future, the future of our time.","token_len":417,"entropy":[1.9437,9.2076,0.2786,0.295,10.4177,2.7687,2.7606,2.5785,4.5224,7.6432,2.2991,1.074,4.8421,6.4875,0.9553,1.4422,6.965,6.613,3.5707,0.3253,0.0475,5.7294,7.7868,2.4493,0.0071,1.3927,1.5774,6.3406,2.7389,6.767,1.6548,5.7239,2.4238,14.0766,6.984,2.8342,6.8438,7.2292,2.8768,8.5074,3.9859,1.7494,1.3804,4.6814,4.8679,3.1636,2.1089,5.919,0.5776,1.5562,5.0476,0.8822,4.914,4.0213,0.9733,1.2426,0.0068,2.3626,5.6092,5.3831,0.2271,3.7324,3.0041,1.02,3.0937,4.9457,0.376,1.9248,1.0954,2.1687,3.7442,1.6112,3.5118,4.3317,5.655,1.2735,2.1664,3.2118,1.8374,1.8371,3.2214,0.1537,5.0327,4.5434,4.5057,3.4448,5.2603,1.9099,0.4774,2.3701,0.0002,3.8518,0.0763,4.7357,6.2311,1.4073,1.3187,5.0034,1.0659,3.9198,2.6915,1.5045,0.992,3.6867,1.1615,3.9271,0.9673,2.658,3.6209,4.4039,3.3019,0.2782,2.6265,5.947,2.8782,1.3254,1.1492,5.4055,6.1324,5.4399,0.4537,4.4946,0.4663,0.8268,0.0002,5.1055,3.2197,2.8599,1.9281,2.1685,4.1068,3.3008,0.9045,5.5784,1.2899,2.6613,0.0865,0.0622,1.5655,2.8253,0.7847,5.1645,3.0243,1.4401,1.0176,4.17,1.6343,2.274,0.0443,0.0916,0.8582,2.811,3.5104,0.3905,2.8995,0.8712,0.0002,2.0191,5.0081,5.0949,0.8139,0.9483,4.5796,4.4037,0.0176,3.1725,1.8748,2.1912,4.5912,4.3511,2.686,3.9567,0.9888,4.8456,4.7709,1.7176,1.3186,4.6682,3.9947,0.5768,0.7083,0.0002,5.0545,0.6249,0.1472,2.181,1.7304,5.082,1.1876,5.1785,2.2763,0.2031,4.4189,0.234,2.2468,2.6322,1.8867,3.9844,4.1265,1.4151,0.0059,5.0864,1.2894,3.7529,0.0449,1.1194,0.1898,1.9251,0.9378,4.4012,1.2702,5.2596,0.5,1.7319,0.0124,4.1904,2.2133,1.0346,0.3302,0.0001,3.2299,0.0329,4.6359,1.0735,0.4642,5.7661,2.4205,0.5098,5.7923,0.3174,3.4553,4.4282,2.5929,0.5395,4.3578,3.2975,4.4202,0.0197,0.6908,4.5199,0.2154,0.6789,3.1018,0.3902,0.3778,0.0001,2.9728,6.1758,2.8725,1.8717,3.3968,3.4662,0.259,0.5208,5.3974,3.9082,2.6475,5.5411,6.5246,2.0124,0.5279,4.5087,0.0628,0.6632,0.5238,0.0001,5.031,5.463,5.1968,0.0315,2.6086,5.7735,3.3249,5.5777,1.2923,5.6889,4.3518,2.7642,1.8388,4.9209,4.4265,2.043,1.9014,1.4678,1.5478,1.9026,3.7502,0.7181,4.0401,7.6848,0.9972,0.0002,3.4953,1.9507,4.8154,4.2211,1.8114,0.2762,2.2281,1.0697,1.2697,3.1912,1.356,3.8022,1.4533,3.1158,0.9604,0.6624,5.5094,0.3322,0.3139,0.0002,4.7774,1.8647,3.7282,0.8125,4.8362,0.4132,2.9643,0.6631,1.869,5.5164,0.7857,4.3438,2.5797,4.9538,0.5953,1.4031,0.7398,0.5124,0.0002,2.5674,1.936,3.107,3.033,1.2749,2.3768,0.3974,3.2332,5.0402,2.4887,5.3649,4.3373,0.4517,0.0165,3.4832,3.7733,2.0181,5.0614,4.3751,5.0409,5.7968,2.5886,1.4844,5.085,0.8519,0.1941,0.0002,2.5481,6.0016,0.0742,2.7419,0.2924,0.4429,1.3411,0.8698,1.9595,4.9272,0.59,4.8106,0.9902,1.4273,0.0014,4.9113,3.814,2.0414,1.0244,0.1255,1.8696,2.8485,2.6229,2.6493,0.2858,2.493,6.2421,0.0005,1.3273,2.2394,2.2497,1.7135,0.7225,0.7402,0.1251,0.0001,3.5026,2.801,4.2118,0.1354,1.7774,3.6437,1.0416,0.0761,2.1339,4.1959,1.1094,1.6238,1.7982,3.1381,0.8621,0.8673,1.2232,0.8268,1.5038,1.898,2.9938,0.7484]}
{"id":4704,"ended":true,"length":384,"gen_text":"The song received generally positive reviews from music critics. Andy Battaglia from The A.V. Club praised Stefani's vocal delivery, saying her `` nasal voice suits the whiny sentiment of the subject, and makes for a great piece of music.''\n\n''It's really great for women in the industry,'' said Linda Kohn, a professor of management studies at the University of Michigan.\n\n\ufffdThese women are always going to be making really good music right now, and so I think it's really important for us to make a strong and successful song where we don't have to give up what we're made for.''\n\nOther companies that play with the music industry have more than one version of their music on their labels. Some are even offering to offer a small bonus, the Music Unlimited, an online subscription service that includes songs written with a particular theme.\n\n\ufffdThis is our company, too, where anyone can start a band, but I really hope that we can help some musicians find their voice and get people to go out and buy some of these songs,'' said Eddy Smith of the Seattle-based Rockabilly Jazz Union, who is serving as a director of the band.\n\nMusic lovers like Kohn who love her work tend to appreciate that Kohn was hired by a major record label, Inc., after writing some of her previous albums for its subsidiary, St. Vincent's Music.\n\nThe song is based on her father's favorite song, ``Don't Touch Me Like I'm A Rock,'' which makes perfect sense given St. Vincent's is a major studio rock band that specializes in selling records. But for Kohn, it's about playing rock 'n' roll with her mother, who has also done a lot of work on her own, including writing for the Beatles and even giving the song a score.\n\nShe also has written songs for her mother's son, the Grateful Dead.\n\nThe song will be released later this year for the first time ever on a VH1 radio stations.","token_len":417,"entropy":[8.7377,8.0395,8.209,0.8979,0.0904,1.5092,4.0709,1.4149,2.1922,8.592,9.1104,2.5028,0.1533,5.5419,2.1786,6.839,0.6316,0.0154,0.0121,0.0,3.055,12.1962,0.9388,0.7314,4.2725,1.3904,1.0903,5.0116,5.2013,12.9956,17.6702,1.523,9.3441,0.9375,10.9869,2.1141,7.9883,1.037,0.7638,5.9075,2.8143,1.4692,3.7337,2.7561,0.6128,2.6849,5.0337,0.292,1.1005,0.8975,1.5417,0.0005,4.7775,2.4047,0.6603,3.4815,3.2589,2.9564,4.4911,2.5039,1.7209,3.3761,0.914,1.091,5.0474,4.7453,4.6536,0.4967,1.763,3.9096,0.3793,5.0702,2.4755,0.1878,1.3719,0.2414,0.0033,2.8186,0.8538,1.6676,0.0002,5.0628,5.4259,1.7532,1.081,4.7192,2.9509,0.0845,1.2763,4.4858,4.6167,1.0023,0.305,5.7853,0.2484,0.7239,0.8826,4.5766,2.394,0.4937,1.3725,0.5352,1.6077,1.3479,0.8913,1.8619,0.2673,2.5932,3.5264,4.1472,4.0178,2.8217,4.3885,6.3091,1.4061,3.213,0.0479,1.6709,0.5207,4.3097,0.7631,3.6797,0.6805,2.0743,4.6202,1.6371,3.2592,0.2247,0.0002,5.2162,5.8481,1.986,5.3909,4.5925,1.3451,3.7494,1.05,2.2541,5.343,2.862,1.9699,3.597,0.2209,3.889,2.0687,3.1288,1.4019,2.9917,0.6114,3.5456,2.6583,4.0331,3.032,3.2358,4.0544,2.5475,4.8347,5.7619,2.5975,5.2953,4.9009,3.7184,3.3176,5.0213,2.9902,2.3297,0.9202,0.8264,3.9312,4.0172,3.9901,3.7839,2.7071,4.4885,3.4116,0.8926,0.7232,0.0003,2.7563,3.5641,0.6139,4.6448,4.8122,0.8605,5.6267,0.5079,4.3773,6.6008,0.2592,4.4715,1.9936,1.9707,1.3479,3.7963,3.2851,4.2865,3.6747,1.0134,1.6132,1.0499,3.6282,3.9921,4.6774,3.2543,1.4477,1.8437,1.2469,2.2221,4.0497,0.95,4.4846,1.0752,0.2563,2.5226,3.7435,1.5337,1.2661,1.3063,2.1104,0.4014,5.5975,4.3717,4.7056,2.9261,2.3373,4.8369,0.4769,0.0053,5.0462,4.7452,0.0187,6.3705,6.359,1.318,1.0918,2.0866,5.6175,0.245,1.8151,3.7651,0.4596,0.599,2.1621,0.8944,0.272,0.0002,4.8114,5.2179,3.8814,2.6194,0.0188,4.401,3.9673,3.0384,3.4121,5.3871,0.0641,4.8713,3.6958,4.0998,0.0383,4.0661,4.6056,1.2501,2.2104,2.3806,2.3002,0.3107,1.7254,6.0861,1.3372,4.0461,4.8295,4.757,0.6308,1.0536,5.7025,2.8009,1.987,3.0588,3.2691,0.7463,5.6196,2.5126,0.7595,1.6064,2.5501,1.059,0.9246,0.0002,2.4195,4.2101,2.5494,3.4261,0.112,2.5306,4.4789,0.2794,4.2781,1.346,0.3661,2.5768,4.6596,0.1347,4.2194,0.71,3.9648,1.7886,0.5975,2.5476,3.4322,2.8309,1.3468,6.3693,5.6076,0.058,1.9993,5.4384,0.0039,0.0029,0.0414,4.2728,1.5009,2.1794,3.9574,3.6944,0.4252,2.7972,4.3782,0.0091,5.6283,3.4271,1.2728,3.9974,4.0025,1.2352,0.0009,0.2347,1.5686,1.3907,3.1418,4.9921,4.7585,4.0074,0.0033,0.1036,0.0021,1.8764,1.1454,3.0304,0.9315,1.2685,2.8004,3.8373,3.8218,2.0406,1.8374,0.1419,2.9043,1.7618,1.1113,0.9573,2.8342,1.3547,2.3026,2.675,2.1676,4.0032,1.2475,5.5479,5.5231,2.9302,3.3473,1.163,4.5073,1.024,0.105,0.0002,2.7527,2.9078,2.265,3.9132,1.8468,0.4388,3.4652,3.2509,1.0507,5.6399,0.697,3.8829,4.7646,0.0014,2.6158,0.7359,0.0002,2.6099,2.0007,3.9743,0.5961,1.1575,4.1433,0.0397,0.5026,3.5738,1.5746,1.3239,0.0208,4.697,1.3542,3.4516,5.3331,2.6119,0.0451,1.5825,5.9544,1.1355]}

The debut date was a weekend, so it couldn't potentially have been taken down without some kind of backlash from the fan community.\n\nIn response, The Onion attempted to get the season-old episode online, claiming it was part of a piracy scam on BitTorrent.\n\nHowever, during filming, the episode was flagged as a \"private show\" on BitTorrent, and was eventually scrubbed from the Internet. The episode has stayed online for another five or six days. The Onion continued with their original claims of piracy and the show's existence on BitTorrent.\n\nWatching the episode, a viewer was asked, what happened to any of your tweets?\n\nAfter a few more days of trying to find out, the onion was finally able to get an account on BitTorrent, but the episode is no longer available online.\n\nWe are so sorry that this episode was scrubbed off from our netflix site. \u2014 The Onion (@TheOon32) February 24, 2013\n\nNot long afterward, on Wednesday morning, some Twitter users were quick enough to take the episode down from your timeline.\n\nI'm sorry, the Onion didn't want this to be taken down. https:\/\/t.co\/JyXjk9P5Nc \u2014 The Onion (@TheOon32) March 18, 2013\n\nI'm so sorry for this horrible episode.

I won't know at the time.\n\nThe original season-old episode of I am a king on BitTorrent, where an anonymous user posted a link to a torrent that led to the real-life arrest of a man who is being framed for the murder of his two kids.","token_len":419,"entropy":[8.8918,1.8927,3.8553,5.5525,2.7671,5.9574,1.1913,3.4196,3.5818,0.5932,2.0708,5.3465,0.6124,0.0007,1.0915,10.7784,2.0274,0.0437,6.8436,4.7159,0.6845,0.3221,3.6673,2.7017,0.7586,1.9358,3.6891,0.4721,1.7063,6.8451,4.9338,1.8848,5.2282,7.0868,2.5367,2.3569,1.6546,6.3834,0.0005,7.02,1.2058,0.4165,5.6813,3.7358,3.7856,2.9123,2.4932,0.0052,4.7753,1.5605,1.2724,4.3451,2.0201,0.3674,0.8788,0.001,3.1175,3.107,0.7852,4.4783,4.6569,5.4057,0.097,3.7363,1.848,4.4539,4.6162,5.6559,1.6346,5.9778,1.3485,3.8418,1.6205,0.6409,4.4269,0.0031,0.827,5.4913,4.7031,4.6909,4.822,0.0656,0.9553,1.7915,0.0002,3.333,0.0375,5.8009,5.2907,0.6878,1.3425,1.0016,0.7417,5.4933,1.3409,1.9135,2.0188,5.5462,3.0254,0.6032,1.8985,2.057,0.003,1.1412,1.6026,1.6929,3.5937,5.8772,0.0005,0.8895,0.511,2.9838,0.8407,2.1082,0.6534,2.5535,7.8069,1.0862,1.7817,4.2628,3.2381,4.1724,0.5008,1.8233,1.5383,3.115,2.4316,5.3462,3.846,1.7223,3.2872,3.8909,2.2662,2.584,2.6965,2.958,3.3506,1.015,4.0953,1.6356,1.3039,0.0005,1.0119,0.3977,0.0002,5.5181,3.8118,0.7407,0.4236,1.2628,3.6345,2.4068,3.7332,2.3581,3.2369,5.4657,3.2447,0.5155,6.0029,0.4222,3.8835,5.2627,1.5607,1.1184,0.0001,4.7362,2.2942,1.6507,3.078,2.8807,0.8451,3.41,0.2284,1.8023,0.7439,0.3535,1.5264,4.5762,3.3805,1.1313,0.0663,0.0027,1.6494,3.9025,6.195,2.1107,0.8612,0.0015,1.8872,2.2005,2.333,1.6909,3.1857,2.2857,0.0177,0.4174,2.5579,0.3317,0.7057,0.0001,4.3632,3.3962,3.633,0.7022,2.6543,1.1239,0.9813,1.6813,3.7759,0.0014,3.2346,3.3229,1.944,5.0458,1.0352,2.4111,0.8259,2.4226,0.4428,0.0054,0.0361,0.191,0.4728,0.6607,7.0649,0.0299,0.4263,4.5372,0.0003,0.1417,0.0891,0.0002,5.395,2.9508,3.7477,0.0575,5.1207,3.9536,3.0963,0.2009,6.0402,3.0292,0.1379,2.7285,1.8958,4.8375,0.012,3.1419,2.2574,1.5946,0.1733,2.026,5.8371,4.3917,0.6636,0.3803,0.0002,3.3775,1.8296,2.1919,2.3744,2.9557,2.2357,3.4518,0.0009,3.2279,2.9054,2.0443,1.4425,2.4896,0.0153,0.9041,3.7188,0.0004,0.0025,0.0005,0.0005,0.001,4.2702,4.3165,3.7926,4.1137,4.2241,3.8767,4.4902,3.722,4.377,4.2234,0.5497,4.1304,0.093,0.0035,0.0012,0.0097,0.0015,0.0079,0.001,4.8068,4.1716,0.0019,0.1038,0.0594,0.0002,2.7886,1.281,2.4918,0.1332,2.7541,2.1943,5.4887,0.8502,0.8391,4.0363,2.6171,0.0008,3.3708,5.8024,0.9566,5.576,3.0312,2.2933,3.3469,2.7675,2.2268,1.1715,0.198,0.0004,0.0027,0.0016,0.0019,0.0009,0.007,0.0014,0.0756,2.1639,0.0014,0.0041,0.0742,0.0002,3.6035,2.9688,2.7116,0.9862,1.1867,5.8239,6.5076,0.038,1.0916,0.8166,4.7596,5.3596,0.0632,0.6849,4.1998,1.948,4.504,5.7482,5.3078,0.0985,0.5102,6.0089,4.7862,0.0026,2.0826,5.4742,2.1872,1.4402,0.9247,0.6985,0.0002,2.5634,3.3809,5.1921,1.735,0.7376,0.3986,1.832,7.5229,3.4411,2.7364,6.0232,3.9835,1.3525,0.0018,2.3922,4.0731,4.6813,1.4996,1.3454,3.0673,0.9228,2.2592,0.1355,1.1452,3.0549,2.8377,5.9208,0.1992,1.3491,5.1351,1.2207,0.1898,3.4686,0.069,1.8106,2.1262,1.4634,3.8738,4.3756,4.8643,0.6291,2.5161,1.8282,0.0392,0.8633,4.3286,4.4278,0.2713]}

He would often talk to the local girls through the channel and even get their attention for their work.\nRamesh's life is one big adventure where he finally has his chance to lead a life of his own.\nAt least the same is true for my father.\nAnd that's as clear as day.\nThank you till now, Ramesh.\nRamesh died in 2004. \u00a0He will be buried in my family. \u00a0I am sad you lost so much.\nI ask all my fellow Mughal people to leave all their tears to him and his family.\nDon't forget to join us at the Chari Thang on Friday at 12:00 PM for a free donation!","token_len":420,"entropy":[2.727,6.6331,2.0309,7.7382,0.2871,6.2294,4.6883,0.5819,0.0711,4.5947,8.4688,2.5853,9.9622,0.3655,2.1963,5.7547,3.9618,8.0509,11.2236,4.4142,3.6303,0.5861,14.4265,11.2594,5.0271,4.3317,3.8163,4.4066,0.356,6.4488,1.8435,0.6321,3.6404,1.9594,6.6223,1.6076,5.4441,5.8287,4.1842,11.4063,0.5799,3.8738,6.3137,9.24,0.5366,1.3423,3.9792,4.2538,1.2974,2.9786,2.1776,3.425,0.5602,4.687,2.6145,4.0953,5.9079,2.8769,0.2187,1.9612,7.692,5.5701,1.3375,0.0028,0.2523,5.4695,1.0265,3.2036,4.1003,2.7467,4.5655,3.1762,0.8157,2.3292,4.6113,1.4064,4.4369,5.3242,1.957,1.9941,0.3896,6.1671,0.4217,2.3707,7.0206,2.3064,0.0186,1.7728,2.3773,4.6246,5.3809,1.4628,5.6675,1.1887,0.0306,0.0055,1.6911,3.0412,3.3456,3.1904,4.4267,3.848,4.7267,5.4318,1.8052,6.8039,3.3857,3.3898,4.3711,3.5387,1.2287,1.795,0.0572,1.4705,2.7542,2.2226,5.0166,4.1548,0.9935,4.2257,3.403,1.0973,3.4323,3.8378,3.516,2.2313,4.8323,3.7544,5.6021,4.9128,0.8129,4.6177,0.5044,0.2822,0.1889,1.0196,4.127,2.9287,1.4886,1.1283,2.1902,1.8546,4.2053,4.5608,1.5692,0.8473,0.9868,1.0132,5.0527,4.3156,3.8148,0.4628,3.6298,2.5347,4.7327,5.5827,0.4878,5.5585,3.7515,0.2988,0.0349,0.0019,0.9025,1.3937,3.5387,4.6645,4.1139,4.9842,0.7666,0.7686,4.0514,0.8708,3.5589,4.7935,2.3662,0.9117,2.0754,2.5747,3.3029,0.7236,5.8219,3.3808,0.883,1.7846,0.7411,3.2999,1.6042,1.9258,5.9169,1.7068,0.2233,1.2911,5.1571,2.485,5.1075,2.3636,6.0232,2.4628,2.5378,4.2824,3.0963,0.3729,2.0302,3.1036,4.4508,1.1223,0.6726,0.3231,0.6652,5.7791,3.5828,0.5167,0.5488,2.3808,3.0151,5.8357,0.3484,0.5863,3.532,5.9754,8.1869,1.9924,1.02,0.5104,4.755,2.6576,1.5152,3.0033,3.6114,0.2401,0.0058,2.7421,2.9822,5.9245,4.4513,2.804,1.3592,0.1352,3.0782,3.6649,2.7739,3.4626,3.9197,5.4061,3.729,3.2165,1.7288,4.612,0.1415,2.055,3.2209,1.7115,2.5871,4.0058,3.7799,4.3113,0.6861,2.6795,2.072,5.6092,0.1291,3.3922,0.047,0.0031,0.8335,1.7857,2.941,4.3575,3.0631,0.6124,2.3321,1.6486,2.9522,3.4679,2.9517,0.6883,3.0016,4.3248,4.5814,6.0812,1.846,5.9023,1.8747,3.1831,4.1627,3.3335,3.3037,3.5787,2.6914,3.4418,0.4392,0.7102,4.6614,0.1181,0.0057,2.5996,3.1731,2.3487,3.2711,4.0776,3.1607,4.8214,0.8507,5.695,2.867,2.5746,1.4201,0.5236,5.3771,1.4889,1.5855,1.095,1.81,0.1646,0.4254,0.8366,5.4062,3.5323,3.9597,4.7101,3.0755,0.5308,0.8348,3.8886,3.771,0.8437,0.8461,5.3007,3.0082,1.3461,6.5835,6.6552,0.2134,0.6414,0.6691,0.5312,4.9392,0.1038,5.2973,5.389,2.0811,2.2136,0.0123,0.0053,0.6672,0.8196,3.0228,0.1412,0.0075,5.2582,1.8382,4.333,1.0937,6.2619,0.2996,1.807,3.2034,0.8514,1.8202,0.922,4.0614,1.6662,2.3831,2.6446,0.0009,1.7338,1.996,3.9888,6.3864,2.8114,3.7769,0.8083,1.3339,0.8457,2.5549,5.4721,2.3127,3.0294,3.8289,4.9122,0.2948,0.4212,3.6476,0.3957,5.3343,4.0279,1.6178,4.9786,3.5802,2.359,1.3113,1.6239,0.4073,0.4948,0.8414,4.972,0.3528,0.6482,0.7505,3.437,1.4021,2.7721,2.2637,5.7584,4.5861,6.1075,3.4277,2.8308,2.5107,3.0378,3.1611,1.3934,0.8261,3.0752,1.8647,1.4883,3.2028,4.7452,4.192]}
{"id":3581,"ended":true,"length":335,"gen_text":"In 2002 the Czerkases published a volume through their Dinosaur Museum titled Feathered Dinosaurs and the Origin of Flight. In this journal they described and named several species. Of the six species named, six were known in the fossil record since the date of the first recorded sighting, four were seen in 1953 and another three did not survive until 1988.\n\nAncariidae, the family of reptiles and amphibians, is part of the family of four major genera of mammals and birds. The order Carnivora, including the family Chrysalididae where it includes the large and relatively common Acisynyasidae, the small and common Chiriflorina, the small and the very common Chichinidae, and the large and relatively common Eutrophthalmophthalmers, may be included as well. The Apatosaurus is a fairly small lizard with no larger reptile relatives known anywhere else.\n\nArthropods, found together from many different and diverse species, often occur on amphibians and reptiles. They are also common to fish such as octopus, sardines, squid, and salmon. Also found are amphibians such as manta ray and eel, some birds such as eels, pomonee, skates, ducks, blue rays, bluefin, moultlings, and many others. There is currently a great deal of uncertainty about how these other animals are related.\n\nAbout the author The author works at the National Zoological Museum in Washington state and at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

{"id":4807,"ended":true,"length":397,"gen_text":"Original reports indicate that a ferry, operated by a doctor who went by `` Dr. Belvidere ``, once ran along the alignment of the Riverton \u2013 Belvidere Bridge. This ferry, crossing the Riverton, was in need of repairs due to the flooding. The incident was initially reported as serious and the Department of State reported no injuries.\n\nThe situation that first led to the flooding may be described as ``sudden and sudden action'' and was followed by similar actions after the flooding. The water level is typically between 70 and 80 inches, and most rivers flow at that level. A large amount of the current flowing through the mountains is produced by the high flow of rivers which can force the surface water away from coastal wetlands. Some areas can also cause the water level to rise further, causing flooding, mudslides, landslides, and a large number of other problems.\n\nWith the current weather pattern becoming more favorable and the weather becoming more favourable during the next several days and weeks, local people will gather to offer their aid in getting relief and help to residents who have been affected by the flood waters.\n\nWhile there may be some localized flooding in the area and the river will continue moving towards some areas of the country, it is important that all residents of the area remain safe from inundation and the associated risks through the remainder of the day, which will last from Saturday, August 28 until Monday, August 29.\n\nAs we will note in today's report, the flooding is occurring in several ways and areas should be on their best behavior due to that fact as they will be inundated over the next few days. In many cases, local and federal authorities may use the flood warning system if necessary to assist in evacuations by taking other steps, but this is not required in this case.\n\nResidents and motorists should remain safely in their cars to assist in getting relief as they could be inundated by the floodwaters.\n\nIf you or your loved one is experiencing flood problems, please contact the Department of State Flood Management Center for assistance, or with questions.","token_len":427,"entropy":[8.6312,3.338,0.4242,3.201,9.0616,3.9792,4.0167,0.0419,2.3648,9.3236,2.4823,5.582,1.429,10.8149,9.7071,0.2595,8.227,4.3428,1.4798,0.0331,3.2442,0.6112,7.9937,3.7359,6.2566,0.6029,11.4488,0.5412,0.6366,6.0092,9.6273,9.4491,6.3359,0.467,0.0074,0.0015,3.2498,1.6015,3.2127,2.58,2.473,7.9939,0.583,2.5833,0.3322,1.3855,1.4853,4.231,4.4386,0.0086,1.0988,4.333,0.0053,1.7005,3.6059,1.4342,1.7486,6.0935,1.8256,4.9522,0.312,1.353,7.184,1.7052,2.1018,4.7521,0.4885,2.5813,4.8471,1.8282,1.5411,0.5765,2.5231,0.0042,1.735,5.9013,4.9801,5.1514,2.7647,0.2717,0.5433,4.2085,5.6834,2.2749,3.8096,0.1608,2.5763,5.1253,0.8001,1.6727,3.0526,4.8507,2.3724,2.2093,3.3795,4.269,0.265,4.4413,3.0057,4.8447,0.7943,3.5168,1.0121,1.7055,4.4511,2.3422,4.2985,5.2962,2.9632,4.6249,0.9076,1.0122,3.0211,1.8633,1.5023,4.3196,4.955,4.6748,1.611,3.6943,0.7852,0.6191,3.563,3.2457,2.7768,0.0162,2.5655,4.8786,1.6471,1.3156,0.4509,6.2406,1.6992,5.1758,0.5416,1.2578,4.543,2.4243,0.6094,3.7895,3.8607,3.1054,5.757,1.7032,4.5894,1.2854,4.6504,0.0562,6.2617,4.9651,0.8758,4.8014,3.6442,3.5141,3.1274,4.6115,2.9604,1.8406,0.7109,0.1081,0.6557,4.1642,2.1212,2.2047,2.5299,2.5849,5.5738,0.1305,0.0828,0.6488,3.3038,0.0009,0.5798,0.6187,4.4747,3.5839,1.3019,0.0022,1.0094,2.2076,0.305,0.898,0.0003,5.5079,0.9401,2.9508,6.231,3.5999,3.741,0.7648,3.8619,2.575,1.0471,4.2585,3.4025,0.6852,5.5788,5.6839,0.4959,2.5341,2.1569,0.9338,2.7776,0.5943,0.2041,5.5021,3.837,2.0479,5.8348,1.7772,5.1129,1.1918,2.9669,1.8482,4.5874,4.3038,2.6295,2.2923,2.0036,4.3082,2.5446,1.2946,0.8372,0.9781,0.3421,0.2769,2.0663,4.1112,0.1605,1.6081,0.0003,5.2718,2.5948,2.6103,0.3549,1.8301,6.1632,2.1081,1.6721,1.3206,1.0113,3.5553,2.3462,3.8647,3.054,1.7487,5.321,4.9884,5.3893,1.3734,2.0994,0.5584,1.8954,0.3737,1.9339,0.7204,1.7496,1.3067,2.7118,1.9633,1.4944,0.6478,1.234,3.4437,2.0664,2.3923,6.1482,0.2351,1.412,3.193,5.3797,3.2394,7.2574,1.3073,4.4994,0.0006,0.1879,1.3616,3.0178,3.6487,1.5346,3.8853,3.4924,4.5129,2.0353,2.7451,3.505,1.8907,1.7225,0.0057,0.5435,0.6482,0.1889,0.687,0.0002,4.1669,3.4815,3.9772,5.4464,1.0059,5.2249,0.0236,2.9121,0.1189,1.3682,3.6223,2.1583,2.7843,1.5623,2.7602,3.4824,2.363,5.1209,4.3192,0.4769,4.227,2.1256,1.6876,0.9126,6.1991,0.0083,6.308,3.1467,5.4634,2.7809,1.8542,1.3624,2.6858,0.0181,5.2093,0.6074,0.4669,0.6694,0.0854,0.7187,3.482,3.8776,0.7716,0.5072,4.1676,3.06,2.0325,1.8321,2.0531,3.6476,2.0897,2.6445,2.748,0.8421,5.2741,2.1057,1.1562,3.1571,1.5119,3.6414,1.204,5.6707,4.7275,4.3564,2.2508,2.6382,2.6173,2.6091,1.1001,0.9464,2.8164,2.5649,2.2072,0.6108,0.4025,0.6252,0.0002,5.1965,3.2905,5.9148,1.1092,2.8853,4.8384,1.803,0.6252,1.9834,3.933,2.6699,1.0849,3.211,1.8425,3.9977,2.0498,4.6101,0.6612,2.7625,0.0015,1.1473,0.7196,1.0705,1.6153,0.6118,1.3192,0.0002,3.6741,0.5416,2.1257,1.5032,1.6757,0.0694,0.8308,2.1435,3.4592,3.3513,1.0759,0.9531,1.4695,0.934,2.1784,0.0259,0.1453,2.0117,1.6837,3.2104,3.6467,1.0584,3.3619,1.2166,5.6799,3.0832,2.5365]}

I can't sleep. I can't focus. I can't breathe.'\n\n\nThe song is not available on the record but its lyrics are reminiscent of those lyrics of the Beatles\n\nR&B recently released a self-titled album to support their upcoming record, The Promise, which details their new approach to soul music, writing and writing the lyrics using words from their previous albums, as well as writing poetry with an eye to his own life.\n\n\nA long-discussed collaboration with 'Madonna' is also in the works, as well as a new single that will be performed alongside a new single titled 'Hallelujah'.\n\n\nIt features 'You're Alright' from their forthcoming album 'Danger Zone'.","token_len":428,"entropy":[9.3514,6.1098,6.2718,2.1749,5.1798,2.7174,8.708,9.1,6.094,5.1017,6.4659,0.6978,1.7037,4.5544,0.7305,5.9661,4.4859,0.3437,0.1003,5.7482,11.067,1.3979,0.0182,3.7836,0.6142,1.9887,7.8075,1.5121,0.9786,0.078,0.1643,0.0047,8.3962,1.9593,0.4241,0.8859,0.001,6.1337,2.6542,4.5868,1.9246,5.625,2.3553,3.7813,0.5706,1.5651,3.6674,0.9204,2.3422,2.6628,1.3791,1.6333,5.6528,1.0422,1.4895,5.2193,4.6081,0.0016,5.3227,6.1947,2.1139,5.2775,3.1011,0.005,1.7817,4.0848,1.3876,0.0062,0.0037,5.1052,6.0545,1.7978,0.5205,5.6301,0.6243,0.0014,5.6457,1.4108,2.9758,1.5926,0.9412,5.18,5.4929,4.5881,3.2811,10.9559,1.3285,0.0005,2.0828,3.9264,2.3246,4.5509,2.5823,1.0978,1.0893,3.8213,1.75,0.7193,0.0004,4.6931,1.7488,2.8277,5.6788,2.7456,5.2599,1.603,3.7923,2.73,2.0475,5.7498,3.3777,3.2232,5.116,5.3789,4.8493,3.3476,1.7204,3.8197,2.8561,6.9174,3.4094,4.0523,5.2086,1.7329,5.4786,0.055,1.8209,5.3589,1.2575,0.3715,4.144,0.3026,0.7717,0.3792,0.0005,3.8641,5.7464,5.6455,4.0276,4.2569,3.0583,6.0455,4.4814,5.4901,0.0025,6.1817,4.2268,0.8154,2.0342,2.9045,2.2349,5.4295,1.3151,5.0128,1.9931,0.998,3.6677,0.0006,1.6112,1.7023,0.4729,1.2625,1.1943,1.6668,5.7896,5.5163,2.4729,4.985,2.1774,0.0683,1.5291,5.2426,1.766,3.8805,5.7113,3.5193,0.3032,0.0005,1.8736,2.8767,6.0823,6.0619,2.6886,2.2998,0.1322,5.2151,2.0997,0.7652,4.7502,5.2093,5.0219,2.4458,4.0043,4.118,1.1554,3.1702,3.2477,4.4451,1.7098,4.8761,0.6134,3.0418,3.677,3.8303,1.5061,2.0599,0.3627,0.8615,1.2451,2.0051,3.0066,0.0005,3.2547,0.3979,0.0012,1.7909,6.1358,5.4188,0.0009,1.1251,4.6942,0.247,2.8984,4.8784,2.7266,5.2685,0.8112,5.3039,1.7499,1.4193,4.5642,2.0408,1.6843,4.0957,3.4207,5.4958,2.5681,5.7716,0.0122,1.1037,0.6237,0.9514,4.0119,0.0005,3.2134,0.912,0.7436,0.5563,2.4755,4.9166,0.4008,3.4462,2.0544,5.5587,4.3701,0.0772,0.4787,3.3144,1.2311,1.3553,0.2665,0.0004,0.7761,5.7224,1.4929,5.1228,1.3125,3.1605,1.254,0.0575,1.4275,1.3516,4.7535,5.5901,4.6986,0.032,1.9615,0.8078,2.5727,0.3355,2.6319,1.4921,0.4679,1.2222,0.0905,5.6331,0.9617,0.3134,0.6856,0.0517,2.6392,1.3066,1.435,0.0006,1.473,1.1109,1.4054,1.3886,0.11,0.0287,0.0198,0.091,3.5424,4.2983,2.035,1.3219,3.8985,0.0136,3.5857,4.9644,1.1489,1.4965,0.8005,4.1772,0.0006,2.4731,0.0994,0.001,5.2955,1.0896,1.1409,5.0886,0.0602,0.0946,0.0015,0.7854,4.0186,4.6041,0.7717,3.1024,3.9878,1.4396,3.0903,5.4205,1.5935,0.6112,6.61,0.8455,2.8211,5.33,0.1596,3.6781,1.8918,3.0854,4.0015,3.3032,4.5298,3.767,0.9744,5.8234,4.6996,1.6973,1.6544,2.5525,1.1895,2.2528,4.2868,0.111,0.006,3.8943,5.4741,3.6927,4.1882,4.0125,1.4084,5.7342,1.1055,2.5116,0.431,1.0115,0.0006,3.9116,5.8588,1.1965,5.0804,1.3468,4.3126,0.9767,5.8867,5.5106,0.9592,0.5342,3.5001,1.4896,1.8356,0.3057,0.0352,1.33,2.3784,2.3566,0.0796,1.3105,1.9081,2.3146,3.6577,1.5117,0.6292,5.3122,4.7254,3.6969,1.5068,1.9683,3.7555,0.6365,4.8362,3.6971,0.0046,0.0016,1.1328,1.1062,0.0006,3.8366,3.2647,4.0397,5.2083,1.5083,5.4889,1.3677,1.0517,2.1592,3.1686,0.853,2.3619,4.5615,2.9301,4.0984,1.7145]}

The government of Pakistan ( Pakistan Media ) said today that it will continue to support the resolution of the Joint Security Conference on resolution 1428 in the next couple of days, and will hold talks with those involved.\"The ICJ said that its decision reflects the determination of the International Atomic Energy Agency in its review of what might have occurred if the resolution were not taken up but not discussed or ratified.''In the past we have discussed with the Congress all these questions. Now the US and India are facing the same issue. That is why the US would be responsible for taking this decision and for ensuring that it is taken up and that the ICC is fully examined in the upcoming days and weeks. It is important for India and its allies to ensure that the situation is fully and fairly examined by the ICC.''I have never met the President here and the chairman, who has called for some form of resolution, has also said he doesn't want India in any position to be on the side of Pakistan as some have indicated, like the prime minister, has said he would have to sit down next month,''said the US State Department official.It has been revealed that the two nations are still negotiating over what will happen under the Security Council resolution.In an interview with The Guardian, JTK's Pakistan unit chief Qasim Qasim said he was optimistic. \"We are still working hard on the issues and will continue to get our support. We will continue to work with our partners on the Joint Task Force and, above all, the Congress.'' He said that Pakistan and India have already been \"moved on at the beginning,'' which means the two governments are now in a very close relationship.''He is very excited to say that Pakistan's government will be involved fully under the joint agreement because there will be a \"significant amount of time and effort\" under the Joint Task Force on the issue,'' he added.","token_len":429,"entropy":[8.7123,2.5827,4.296,0.4898,9.9406,5.6333,0.1086,7.752,5.033,5.8828,6.7552,1.8579,4.8012,0.6923,8.6075,2.7427,2.4221,0.2902,8.8865,1.0914,7.2256,16.7918,11.4092,6.2447,3.9754,8.4314,8.3044,0.9037,3.8504,3.9566,7.1297,3.3699,2.7685,6.1892,10.755,1.5819,2.9147,2.3059,5.1684,1.9301,3.3866,1.2625,4.6366,1.56,4.9859,1.8543,2.4787,4.5926,2.006,5.5638,5.2235,5.2714,5.2971,1.9492,1.9472,5.9285,0.4837,1.3231,2.3712,1.9166,0.3703,2.0928,0.509,1.047,1.0899,0.3991,5.852,1.63,2.7045,1.3996,5.7058,3.4807,4.7384,3.7213,1.6696,5.0844,4.049,0.0221,0.143,1.971,1.9299,2.0513,4.7206,2.5675,0.398,5.8199,2.4208,4.5359,3.2799,1.9784,0.0279,4.011,1.4861,4.0638,1.7656,5.515,0.897,5.7705,0.2443,0.5925,4.2684,1.4889,0.0003,0.0003,4.0049,1.8847,4.389,0.1732,5.3844,5.6846,1.297,2.9869,1.4419,0.8939,2.1206,2.2483,1.5318,3.1145,1.7332,5.6416,2.4463,3.9236,3.3356,3.0417,5.3375,3.7194,2.2657,2.0297,5.2318,0.2168,3.5373,3.6933,0.8569,5.8247,4.4609,3.9172,3.2108,2.7269,3.8453,2.685,6.0579,2.0483,3.4119,1.3659,5.3413,2.1741,0.6911,2.3231,1.001,4.521,0.6418,0.9732,1.8879,2.7724,5.2627,2.5073,5.2919,0.2796,3.5172,3.1778,2.1863,1.7791,4.0949,3.7454,0.463,2.0379,0.7206,1.4939,0.1176,1.8596,1.4749,1.7884,5.6962,1.8932,3.2967,4.2358,3.1157,1.6394,5.9634,0.9268,1.8928,0.6156,1.1584,3.0788,0.6423,2.5761,1.7081,3.239,1.3825,4.7599,1.3062,0.6613,3.459,0.1634,1.1367,4.7875,1.2275,2.7767,4.367,2.8262,2.1413,2.116,0.5027,1.6171,4.0715,4.9674,2.5877,4.7452,2.8929,2.0763,1.8043,6.4015,2.2841,3.2159,5.9655,3.283,3.4565,1.8275,4.2228,1.2304,6.0807,3.4962,0.0015,1.9169,1.2107,1.7358,4.4491,1.8666,2.3583,4.4329,0.0035,1.5345,4.5969,4.2619,2.543,2.6145,0.4194,2.837,5.6935,0.5617,2.6601,0.0374,1.598,4.1194,5.2119,2.1338,4.779,2.4204,6.0291,1.5242,4.0919,0.0151,1.1678,3.7195,0.9273,1.5536,1.8686,3.7966,2.1897,4.4001,0.6087,6.2583,3.0821,4.5918,3.8626,1.6164,3.5435,3.7517,0.0249,2.0555,0.8808,4.8985,2.8259,0.6123,4.4448,0.407,1.0527,4.5652,3.2849,1.977,3.3717,2.2116,1.4655,3.2036,2.8367,0.8904,4.9026,0.3002,3.6841,0.0177,0.4305,1.3217,4.741,2.5944,0.8408,0.6107,2.3387,4.4816,1.0758,4.9389,4.1767,4.814,2.6205,4.3072,5.7464,0.791,5.0954,2.6324,0.0256,2.8264,0.639,0.0073,0.7889,2.652,1.9061,4.1345,5.579,1.6942,1.5358,1.2453,2.5339,2.1489,3.9248,1.3357,0.9779,3.6077,1.9859,3.3142,1.2955,0.1584,5.1605,3.6023,3.5387,2.3892,1.2261,1.7792,1.5482,0.1795,1.5107,1.3247,2.4756,1.3651,2.5876,1.2959,5.5814,5.989,0.0667,2.8306,5.1348,5.4392,0.0098,0.0766,1.6896,4.6933,3.7344,3.9705,0.7507,1.3634,2.5429,2.9641,0.6709,2.1378,3.8439,3.2802,5.5992,4.9838,1.6353,2.3585,5.4583,1.2045,4.2064,4.9731,3.545,2.4158,2.4651,1.3063,3.4082,1.6098,2.5056,2.4176,1.1236,3.4529,2.1122,2.0714,3.033,5.4715,3.6077,2.278,3.8221,2.4514,4.8548,0.4968,2.3836,3.9539,4.1093,2.4,1.5323,3.4736,6.5561,6.312,0.358,3.0314,4.5983,4.778,3.3334,2.1371,0.1276,1.7209,5.5353,4.5807,3.2119,0.1891,3.7627,2.2542,1.1037,1.3638,4.0745,0.4435,1.5802,0.4419,0.0162,2.6207,1.502,1.8751,1.327,1.3338,1.8613,0.1712]}

The arrest report says that two days later, police found two firearms inside the group's home that they believe were used in one of the shootings.\n\n- - - - -\n\nMore from The Fiscal Times:\n\n[DAM NITRO'S HEAD PICTURE OF CHAT MOUTH PEDRO'S 'OLE MAIL' REVEALS HIS NAME]\n\n[A BROADCAST OF 'OLE MATCHES' IN NEW YORK TO START PLAY IN MAY 2000]\n\n--\n\nFollow The Fiscal Times on Twitter @The_Fact_Fiscal_Times.","token_len":432,"entropy":[11.7142,1.3253,5.9396,0.5804,7.9128,10.82,1.2004,4.6526,1.1005,0.0195,6.446,2.016,3.8763,4.076,2.1605,0.9066,2.4833,7.2048,5.9155,4.8666,12.7677,8.6901,4.311,9.0666,1.8046,0.0625,6.011,2.9865,0.0858,0.6927,7.929,3.7682,5.3756,0.5262,4.3706,3.7751,4.0969,1.2338,0.1616,4.9732,5.7694,0.9847,0.92,2.5918,1.6066,3.0123,1.868,0.0626,3.1576,4.6823,1.6897,1.1168,5.6398,0.0006,1.5207,3.4001,1.2746,3.2963,1.0373,5.4578,5.5205,5.0316,4.3755,2.5347,3.0512,2.0509,0.0529,2.9105,3.4892,2.2506,3.4944,5.4668,2.5232,0.6633,1.2476,0.0011,4.733,4.8835,0.0006,0.7164,0.3158,0.0949,1.8756,4.8148,1.7434,5.1069,3.4573,4.5222,3.2683,1.8793,1.1319,1.6805,4.774,3.2348,5.7432,0.8877,0.1403,0.4244,3.0152,4.2959,6.7296,0.5458,4.1972,0.0945,0.0318,2.1933,2.3604,1.5792,3.762,3.8244,2.557,0.9958,2.9194,0.5165,0.7238,1.6904,0.6149,2.8403,3.9589,0.2195,4.5333,0.8199,2.1934,0.3425,6.4844,1.3646,0.0334,0.0042,4.3443,1.2863,3.0496,1.0093,4.61,5.6894,1.0867,5.3634,0.0506,0.3404,0.7667,1.7251,2.1702,4.4045,2.5528,1.8575,1.5988,0.2481,0.7056,6.2166,3.0979,3.0773,1.1337,4.6017,1.1778,0.3711,3.7205,2.3172,2.3446,0.3543,0.177,1.148,1.2571,0.4616,0.2704,2.6888,0.6446,0.0033,0.0046,2.0995,4.9685,2.019,0.7532,5.6122,3.4821,1.3272,5.266,1.1975,0.3989,1.8232,3.6525,1.8899,5.1488,4.2454,2.6235,1.6646,1.6113,5.3086,1.5252,0.7891,0.5276,2.3653,4.0805,1.423,0.0024,0.986,0.0134,2.8533,1.1666,2.673,2.253,1.963,2.0503,5.1136,3.3751,0.0013,1.6284,0.2173,0.286,1.9848,2.2993,3.313,3.1099,2.7433,3.2672,4.5902,4.7588,3.5178,1.5555,5.4348,0.1278,1.1824,1.1332,0.0003,3.7172,2.3515,4.3866,0.0013,0.727,0.2764,0.1804,1.2631,0.9772,0.049,0.5067,0.0505,0.0114,0.1357,0.0168,0.0379,0.0302,0.0456,0.0055,0.0421,5.8068,0.8824,5.6146,4.3242,0.6569,1.8957,0.9493,0.9772,1.9797,3.0936,0.1566,0.1113,0.7384,0.0003,0.0581,3.1424,3.1966,0.0771,0.808,1.2179,4.898,0.6075,0.7115,1.3019,1.0416,5.1175,1.2432,5.6828,0.6998,2.1012,6.7468,1.2416,3.8313,0.3346,0.0014,4.5976,2.9411,5.8534,0.4166,4.3477,1.3548,1.0503,1.6368,0.7073,1.6864,0.1589,1.3952,0.2278,1.0164,0.1907,1.0723,3.7829,0.3283,1.8743,1.4926,0.4287,0.0049,1.3791,0.0013,0.3521,0.0037,0.8472,1.6376,6.0231,2.6098,2.757,0.9494,5.1571,3.4531,0.5594,0.3924,2.4824,1.5918,3.7217,3.3129,2.9398,0.4355,5.4586,0.4969,0.4415,3.5404,2.1149,2.0424,0.7248,0.5593,0.6474,6.4552,0.2095,0.1133,1.0471,0.1485,1.1442,0.0002,7.0862,1.4089,0.0561,0.1635,0.0886,2.6561,0.0002,3.7738,0.7069,2.7825,2.6004,0.0663,0.1293,0.1981,0.0002,5.6539,5.9166,5.6413,5.4985,4.2808,2.3346,2.3259,0.0319,5.6837,5.4685,2.4886,0.2779,2.1267,5.4655,4.0789,5.5875,4.0729,0.364,5.1728,3.3726,2.46,2.3389,0.0096,4.5559,5.3892,1.1248,4.0715,1.7825,1.564,5.1449,1.2168,1.2536,2.3274,4.0553,0.5602,0.1238,0.0003,2.39,4.163,5.6703,1.9161,1.1676,0.4176,2.8359,2.0212,0.0692,3.3168,4.0865,3.3838,0.6066,3.1245,3.6651,0.6757,5.6336,4.8186,4.7192,2.4966,5.0788,5.6206,0.3837,0.208,0.0003,4.0179,2.5975,0.0002,1.5254,0.4712,0.0598,0.0006,0.0747,0.0842,0.6317,1.2617,2.04,3.5367,0.135,4.3856,1.0418,1.452,0.4266,0.6975]}

After emerging into the south @ - @ central Gulf of Mexico, the tropical cyclone moved in in the Atlantic Ocean using the southern Caribbean Sea.\n\nThe storm formed near the mouth of the Gulf of Mexico and moved to the south-central Gulf of Mexico, a part of the coast that is used for shipping between Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico. During the storm, the powerful storm strengthened and pushed the westward momentum along oceanic currents, sending the storm into the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic Seaboard. The hurricane continued moving northeast, causing more powerful storms that swept ashore inland on coastal islands.\n\nThe hurricane weakened over the Gulf of Mexico twice, traveling through parts of Puerto Rico, the Caribbean, and New Orleans. Despite being small in the area and extremely variable weather pattern with little visibility across the Atlantic, it began weakening in parts of the Gulf of Mexico and the Bahamas on August 19 and returned to the coast about 90 days after landfall. Hurricane Matthew has destroyed much of Puerto Rico, and the island of Hispaniola is about 8 miles east of the storm's center.\n\nThe tropical cyclone moved northwest over southeastern Mexico from August 4 to August 6, passing through the southwestern United States through the San Joaquin River, which borders the southern United States. While there were no casualties during that time, four bodies were recovered from a car and at least one person is believed dead. The storm had overcast skies and was moving over more than 15 miles in the past three days.\n\nThe Florida-Quebec-Mississippi-Mississippi Power line from Jacksonville to Tampa, Florida has been the sole power grid in New Orleans and was completely closed for several days with an outage. One person remains missing from the power outage.\n\n#Irma #Forecast is now in full track #HurricaneMatt2 \u2014 National Guard (@National_GPS2) August 18, 2017\n\nImage used for this report was released from the National Hurricane Center's Hurricane Prediction Center Twitter feed.","token_len":432,"entropy":[11.6242,7.3299,9.5683,3.5776,0.3968,3.7336,7.0134,4.353,3.7826,4.1976,0.3719,1.5331,2.0643,6.4574,3.2498,3.1352,0.3169,9.0139,0.3568,2.337,0.0002,2.7532,1.8058,5.7588,7.8942,3.8318,0.4063,4.9662,12.9141,7.5525,5.3881,6.8982,6.4491,0.4162,0.0299,1.9471,1.2184,2.2967,1.7245,0.0527,1.6712,4.3037,5.1252,0.8749,4.3405,1.1613,5.5996,1.1748,4.5345,3.5805,1.3826,1.3716,2.0076,0.0036,1.5842,2.0872,5.2472,3.3873,0.9665,3.1643,0.0159,0.333,2.4767,0.2271,0.3365,1.9861,2.9355,3.6272,0.599,3.0252,3.3444,1.2302,1.5684,0.5275,0.4572,2.0591,4.7477,5.3699,0.0104,0.2772,5.3618,2.3067,1.5854,5.2633,1.281,1.8023,4.3538,2.592,0.4895,0.8365,2.4743,0.1133,0.2851,0.26,4.8874,0.7145,1.1425,0.5525,0.86,5.6826,1.8934,4.8204,1.4884,4.4429,1.0962,4.9639,0.6846,5.076,3.8995,7.1921,0.8872,2.1431,1.7249,4.3368,1.2832,0.6808,2.1687,0.4301,4.4236,0.3634,2.6042,2.5031,2.865,0.7227,5.276,0.4098,0.0065,0.417,1.8373,2.6315,4.0816,3.4382,3.585,3.0191,4.1015,3.7606,3.6644,1.5708,3.2086,3.7991,2.3838,5.3279,3.9903,6.367,0.8859,0.9708,0.5848,0.0003,1.309,2.3779,4.3457,3.9574,0.815,3.0396,0.1325,0.025,6.9551,1.6194,5.4427,2.9647,3.2075,0.004,4.831,0.0277,1.0226,1.8583,2.0301,1.1438,0.9607,4.0171,3.1934,1.0169,6.2798,3.3467,5.494,2.079,4.0267,2.3972,2.9261,5.0283,5.8506,3.8409,5.4581,5.6278,3.7395,3.8751,4.3547,0.3831,2.1301,0.6916,1.9615,5.2052,3.7038,1.8636,4.6636,0.0123,0.9444,1.9795,0.4654,0.0393,1.3755,2.3681,3.2173,2.5437,3.0081,3.5781,1.5571,4.9327,0.3414,0.5388,3.3077,4.6233,4.4673,1.8456,4.3266,1.25,0.2128,4.2227,2.565,4.2629,4.9171,2.9426,0.0134,2.7419,0.0027,1.1458,2.1872,1.8468,2.3169,1.2805,1.6235,0.0011,1.5549,4.9553,4.7805,0.6022,3.2841,0.0724,0.7511,2.0356,2.0514,1.194,0.2555,0.5255,0.0002,1.483,3.6685,0.0894,0.0205,2.2188,3.5526,2.9565,4.9343,2.758,4.0178,3.6401,5.2494,0.5515,0.7648,2.6436,1.0851,4.75,0.8254,1.0175,3.9625,1.7196,0.0025,4.076,0.9063,4.0704,1.4224,0.0005,1.0116,2.0388,3.306,5.2102,1.1711,4.4037,1.6049,0.0016,0.4621,4.836,3.9032,1.6435,0.9654,5.9947,3.7309,3.1433,0.9218,0.3003,5.7404,5.1345,0.3356,1.1032,0.7723,1.9886,4.6882,3.657,4.2004,0.0018,1.1221,0.8603,4.0343,2.0362,2.7366,0.8636,1.959,1.6665,4.2694,5.8559,3.0306,0.4628,1.1743,2.6027,2.1362,4.859,4.9416,1.0219,4.5918,0.4178,2.6112,1.8229,4.8448,3.1328,0.1413,0.4767,0.4502,0.0002,1.2561,5.8425,2.6063,5.374,0.5508,2.8206,4.9839,0.5095,0.0026,1.3485,4.0108,1.8512,0.0406,5.058,3.2025,4.4485,3.8365,0.6196,3.2059,2.1118,0.8169,3.6371,0.7373,4.5557,5.863,1.2476,3.2097,1.1501,5.456,0.5058,2.1685,3.0489,4.3765,3.2231,2.3957,2.369,0.424,4.9634,4.6247,1.4893,2.232,5.8355,2.5542,4.5368,0.8908,2.0158,0.4882,2.2622,2.0979,0.9451,0.5839,0.0002,5.3393,4.4988,0.0045,4.0554,5.663,1.5011,3.4249,2.6778,2.2134,1.9749,6.0132,2.8907,1.6772,0.0175,5.3203,5.1355,2.8566,3.7575,4.7481,1.5355,1.3179,1.7027,3.2907,1.4859,6.6031,0.0674,0.3358,3.1027,0.0003,0.1931,0.074,0.0002,5.8861,5.747,4.1187,1.0509,1.8288,1.5894,3.8792,2.1377,0.9164,1.0196,0.6009,0.0093,1.4894,1.5669,1.5503,0.0121,5.3248,1.2869,0.4485]}

Tucker, Michelle had five children. In November 1989, Erickson purchased a 15% interest in the Atlanta Braves. Erickson purchased a majority stake in the Atlanta Braves and sold the majority stake to Erickson for $4.5 million.\n\nIn June 1989, the year that he married Sandra Lacy, Erickson received her first mortgage in the new New Orleans shopping mall. The lender then loaned her $1.1 million in credit card debt because her home had been broken into into multiple times with multiple attacks. The mortgage was issued for one year because of the damage she caused to the building housing the four separate cars in the living room of Erickson's home. Erickson died in December 1989 from a stroke and the house was not returned to Erickson until December 1992.\n\nIn February 1990, Sandra Lacy got his divorce from Erickson. His estranged wife, Elizabeth T. Taylor, went to the hospital on April 14 to report a fever, and began to complain about his health. Erickson got very sick during the visit, where they continued to watch television and drank alcohol, which was common in the community. He had asthma, went blind, had seizures, developed an ulcerated abdomen and an infection.\n\nErickson's death sparked a national mourning in Atlanta because of his love of nature.

Walter had previously said 'You can't do that, you just aren't that kind of scientist.'\n\nAppearances Edit","token_len":434,"entropy":[7.9901,1.8201,7.145,5.3255,5.0157,5.6325,1.879,0.9531,1.2001,0.0007,5.3306,5.3405,16.5925,6.7158,4.8404,11.0714,6.9434,16.6217,6.5567,4.6437,1.1009,4.7403,0.9104,2.7227,0.1129,2.1627,3.4132,0.4051,4.8113,0.0036,1.7523,6.5487,4.1694,1.9794,3.8721,0.9152,10.5354,8.5881,0.0005,1.8491,1.3391,4.6296,2.8598,0.0336,5.0161,6.5458,1.4242,4.6972,1.148,3.2916,2.4301,3.6962,0.0048,4.9273,6.6963,0.8634,3.3904,7.5594,3.2533,3.9686,5.7895,1.5668,1.0377,5.1451,3.3269,1.2147,0.3264,1.9576,11.3614,3.3382,0.8713,2.1463,8.0333,6.8324,2.6555,1.839,1.2634,6.2135,2.1108,4.7503,3.0767,3.4082,3.9679,0.6097,5.9555,0.805,2.6105,2.7539,2.5337,0.4755,1.3401,2.3016,5.1814,5.8169,2.4213,3.751,2.3663,4.5053,4.6092,2.1499,1.0269,2.2405,0.0003,9.0853,3.1804,2.1011,1.2739,0.0264,0.0765,0.0022,0.0244,0.2801,0.0258,0.0296,0.0011,0.0257,10.6142,0.7062,0.0094,0.0013,0.0006,0.0016,0.0024,0.002,0.0018,0.0016,0.0083,0.005,0.002,0.002,0.0031,0.0279,0.001,0.0026,0.0005,0.0589,0.0076,0.0057,0.0034,0.0012,0.0008,0.0008,0.0008,4.8569,0.0004,0.0013,4.8643,5.9796,2.9148,0.0462,6.1916,3.4199,4.2345,1.1006,1.4121,3.9265,3.2965,3.2066,0.07,3.5164,1.8677,6.6338,0.6238,5.1695,0.6236,2.6738,1.2329,4.0472,6.1972,0.9058,5.6828,3.8087,1.719,0.4958,1.4942,0.0002,4.4338,1.3655,2.6878,0.0023,0.0033,0.0659,0.0031,0.0012,0.0294,0.0084,0.024,0.0008,0.0106,8.3081,0.3088,0.0077,0.0044,0.0013,0.0023,0.0058,0.0023,0.0022,0.0025,0.0084,0.0049,0.002,0.0031,0.0027,0.0143,0.0008,0.0031,0.0006,0.014,0.0169,0.0054,0.0056,0.0019,0.0006,0.002,0.0011,0.7107,0.0022,0.0025,1.3347,0.0941,0.0012,0.0002,0.0026,0.002,0.0019,0.0153,0.0013,0.0104,0.0039,0.0188,0.0011,0.0039,0.0293,0.0016,0.0004,0.0007,0.0002,0.0046,0.0031,0.0021,0.0121,0.0302,0.0203,0.0001,0.1342,0.0013,2.3065,3.7494,3.3091,0.7866,1.4205,5.7362,4.2074,5.3092,3.2443,2.5076,1.483,0.2907,2.3523,5.4392,7.2329,1.5573,4.2523,3.052,5.3987,4.0795,5.474,5.5229,4.5718,4.4777,3.1822,7.0785,0.472,0.4572,5.0228,1.4216,3.4089,1.2071,3.9004,3.277,2.8407,5.1071,2.1303,2.061,5.2873,3.294,2.5509,0.015,4.0344,2.2318,0.3173,1.029,4.3261,1.215,0.1087,0.1696,3.2172,2.8312,3.3909,0.008,3.4171,1.9896,2.7913,4.8612,0.5487,0.6965,0.241,0.8142,2.1042,1.8858,2.0849,6.7137,3.434,1.7193,3.5484,4.2008,2.9101,1.4602,0.4526,0.0003,4.2407,2.1612,0.0018,0.0039,0.0164,0.0297,0.0034,0.0427,0.0013,0.0034,0.001,0.001,0.0079,0.0281,0.0026,0.0017,0.0004,0.0055,0.0039,0.0013,0.001,0.0017,0.0031,0.0013,0.0007,0.0017,0.0038,0.0005,0.0018,0.0054,0.0006,0.003,0.0005,0.0006,0.0008,0.0033,0.0029,0.0016,0.001,1.9426,2.663,4.6635,6.15,2.1732,5.2597,0.8646,1.054,3.0318,7.8909,3.7327,4.6375,4.9823,5.1501,2.3117,3.4648,5.1633,0.8562,9.2759,7.5034,3.1229,4.1422,5.2541,1.6521,4.3146,0.8332,1.6087,1.9723,6.6514,3.6259,0.0479,1.0969,8.0042,0.2616,0.5415,4.0633,4.6229,5.4719,0.0286,4.5905,0.6548,2.8285,0.1585,2.2871,0.8047,12.2168,6.7857,1.2531,0.6804,2.8208,2.4885,5.4405,4.3604,4.1825,5.2019,2.0519,0.6458,2.0491,1.403,2.7258,1.2914,3.0807,6.0616,0.0174,3.3084,2.9903,0.1269,4.141,0.6853,1.206,0.0003,6.2604,0.7492]}

The strategy was to add more improvements to both engines' performance on top of the previous strategy.\nAn interesting finding was that the new version of the engine's four-speed digital differential has become relatively more of a technical innovation. As well as incorporating a small amount of air flow into what he called 'the air compressor', the new engine has also employed four new exhausts that have been optimized to deliver the best possible performance. There are also two smaller exhausts that emit a low temperature air that is compressed, with an exhaust pressure of 9.0 Mg or higher. This has also allowed the new engine to be a quieter, and cheaper, option for racing.\nThe fact that < unk > were able to take the new engine's best fuel mix, and to produce so much power and velocity under load, adds up to some of the positive attributes of a'more reliable, more responsive and more powerful' car.

{"id":996,"ended":true,"length":380,"gen_text":"Hurricane Janet was the most powerful tropical cyclone of the season and one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record. The hurricane formed from a tropical wave east of the Lesser Antilles on September 26 and sustained winds that are expected to reach hurricane strength on September 30.\n\nThe storm formed near the mouth of the Gulf of Mexico and extended to the south-central Bahamas. The storm moved eastward and into the central Bahamas where it formed over three miles during landfall Monday evening after coming ashore. The strongest storm ever recorded in the Bahamas on Sept. 26 came on Tuesday at 1.48 p.m. A new record-breaking storm is expected to break the record for strongest tropical cyclone of the season.\n\nIt made landfall at 12:59 p.m. on the Gulf of Mexico, followed by a southward motion. As a result more than 80 feet of rain fell in the area from the Gulf Coast, including several large hail strikes that had disrupted some traffic and caused damage.\n\nHarper, who was not in a position to participate in the live TV news show, said the storm appeared to have settled down enough to allow for a \"healthy\" and longer-lasting storm surge to come through. Harvey was one of two storms that hit the Gulf Coast on Monday, killing thousands of people in the northern Gulf counties. Harvey, meanwhile, also made landfall on the Atlantic coast, making landfall along the northern coast. At 9:15 p.m., a category 8 Hurricane washed ashore on the coast of Florida at Lake Victoria in Florida.\n\nHarper struck about 10 miles past the Miami-Dade metropolitan area and made landfall at 11 a.m. It made landfall at 7:14 p.m. on the Gulf Coast, followed by a southward motion and then a long distance away at 10:15 p.m., the Palm Beach Post reports.\n\nAccording to National Hurricane Center\n\nA Category 5 hurricane will move to the eastern part of the United States by Sunday night. In its coming weekend, it could wreak havoc with the Southeast, the East Coast, Hawaii, the Florida Keys and southeastern Gulf states.","token_len":438,"entropy":[8.9305,8.3909,2.8106,3.0715,2.5757,0.9667,4.1334,1.118,0.0083,3.1482,0.4977,2.9917,2.5002,5.6492,0.3491,0.1444,1.1398,6.6677,1.1543,2.609,0.0054,0.5131,1.9614,2.3611,6.2513,3.175,1.1278,2.9031,6.1265,7.3885,0.4823,0.7712,9.9918,0.0263,0.1813,0.0067,3.0604,2.85,3.6041,1.8788,4.4896,0.7073,4.9573,4.7774,2.7774,0.0045,0.5638,3.3659,1.0585,3.5537,1.3594,1.7709,0.2935,1.107,0.0004,1.5635,1.4659,4.6628,3.9976,0.7739,2.7162,0.0087,0.4668,2.9672,0.3463,0.0341,1.8051,5.007,2.5438,0.8044,3.6617,2.5696,0.9466,3.2605,1.3544,1.4417,1.2316,3.1907,2.6482,0.8197,2.5104,4.5709,0.3775,4.0886,0.3216,3.4926,0.1443,2.4877,3.3991,4.4422,2.484,6.3543,4.0628,6.389,2.7832,6.5353,4.7547,0.8055,2.1893,1.9669,5.1044,1.3429,3.4022,0.2144,1.5119,0.6364,1.1728,3.8892,2.121,0.0535,1.3622,3.2754,2.2324,5.1045,3.7286,2.9798,1.4904,4.4837,2.0655,0.0012,0.001,0.2861,3.9418,5.075,0.6835,2.8373,0.2892,1.1763,2.9886,0.7495,0.7632,2.1539,1.0637,0.6638,1.2292,1.6379,1.8905,0.1519,0.0642,2.3979,0.2866,0.4783,1.4221,0.403,0.0001,4.9525,4.6855,0.0478,1.919,3.3151,0.2221,4.287,0.1071,0.0003,0.0002,0.0854,2.782,1.52,3.5492,0.4724,0.1091,1.6695,5.1951,0.118,0.6026,5.5505,1.9282,2.6688,3.5056,4.8535,3.044,0.8439,8.2811,0.5006,4.1554,2.8919,0.2782,1.1598,0.4682,1.869,1.1765,2.0673,3.4086,1.3329,2.9845,3.1229,1.7607,3.2058,4.3498,3.905,3.1814,3.5099,2.5544,5.0716,4.8397,4.6559,4.9362,2.2399,1.9062,2.9289,1.7292,0.785,0.0002,5.1378,2.6925,3.7733,1.6069,1.52,3.8873,2.0586,3.4508,0.7215,0.0141,4.8985,0.0741,0.5085,5.6343,4.0511,3.0129,4.1344,0.4195,1.377,1.5618,0.7087,4.7753,0.2519,1.4423,4.9686,2.575,4.8045,0.3128,2.9662,2.2938,1.85,3.5936,4.9302,1.5451,4.9112,5.6337,1.1764,0.3333,1.6524,1.6105,2.5895,3.5206,1.5196,0.6403,4.9576,2.0001,3.9699,0.0206,2.9397,2.3882,1.4212,2.4651,0.9472,1.9133,0.4282,1.8236,2.1287,1.5032,5.6646,5.6986,0.9251,0.0715,2.3914,1.5415,4.532,2.2808,5.6479,1.9868,3.5472,3.5626,4.1136,0.0072,4.2181,2.555,0.0128,1.8675,0.8316,3.1814,0.6509,1.6027,2.845,0.1673,4.3968,0.2643,4.1253,1.1657,2.3663,6.1932,4.8349,0.4706,3.0701,0.1934,0.0005,0.0006,0.2779,2.4771,5.3303,4.5749,4.0965,5.9409,0.2238,1.4136,0.4465,2.5667,0.2464,2.2295,4.2262,5.6951,5.1891,2.5973,3.5666,0.9031,0.6354,0.0002,1.3162,0.0628,4.6794,3.9053,2.6122,0.3369,7.7374,0.8262,4.7335,1.0371,0.352,0.0011,2.9645,0.0419,2.161,3.5775,0.0226,1.7584,2.5699,2.642,0.0004,0.0002,0.2781,3.94,2.7762,0.0652,1.458,3.3799,0.4511,3.9126,0.2032,0.0006,0.0001,0.2551,1.7497,0.1716,1.3246,0.4239,1.3579,2.1041,0.044,0.2878,1.6576,0.1119,0.0864,2.6005,2.0089,0.8502,4.5271,5.9894,4.7107,3.816,2.4522,0.2632,3.2001,0.1873,0.0008,0.0001,2.1593,3.3094,5.8218,0.1112,0.1309,1.9159,0.0524,0.5871,0.0002,5.7815,0.0027,4.1642,0.189,0.0066,5.717,0.0002,4.5057,2.8575,0.9084,0.6926,4.3632,3.9949,3.6595,0.6933,3.7073,3.8,0.0024,0.1875,1.763,0.0032,2.7482,2.8665,2.3985,1.4307,4.362,3.9022,5.988,5.4254,0.491,1.9356,1.8833,4.9852,0.0008,0.3701,3.3121,1.9985,4.1655,1.5183,2.6586,3.8708,0.3602,0.9598,5.5238,0.7684,1.3712,5.2842,0.051,0.5891,5.4922,3.7071,2.3152,0.5339]}

The wave did not significantly develop as it moved west across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. Once it crossed Florida and North Carolina it ended up coming to Puerto Rico on May 22.\n\nThe wave did have a short-lived dip in intensity across the Caribbean Sea, and that's probably what prompted its departure from the coast. In fact, it didn't make it past Puerto Rico before it headed its way through the Caribbean.\n\nAerial footage shows the ocean wave moving southwest at 1.48 am, and the southern island's coast is being monitored by NOAA with two major storm watches. There are a total of 19 monitoring stations on the southern coast, with a total of 38 stations on the northern island.\n\nIt is now off limits to US military aircraft.\n\nA hurricane watch posted in Hawaii is showing some danger but it is relatively low. There are five major warnings, and the state has about 250 state agencies, and there are about 800 civil and military personnel on active duty, so some of the activity won't go unnoticed.\n\nOfficials are concerned about flooding in and around the island.\n\n\"We've had to cut up the whole building and move some things up to the next site where they've got to keep the storm in place.

{"id":841,"ended":false,"length":375,"gen_text":"The name Giacomo Meyerbeer first became known internationally with his opera Il crociato in Egitto \u2014 premiered in Venice in 1824 and produced in London and Paris in 1825 ; incidentally, it was the final piece in the opera in the year 1828. But many of the Italian-born actors did not play any part in the dramatic films until after the War, and Giacomo Meyerbeer became known through the following three films,'Il della B\u00e9rie \u2014'' (1847),'Il d\u00e9cambie, and the short story'La Lager.' However, Meyermeyerbeer stayed in the industry long after the war. The play continued to feature in The Lamps of the Night, but he never came out for it as a full-length opera ; this was, of course, partly because of his lack of screen time.\n\nMeyerbeer has since returned to Hollywood, where he has directed an adaptation of a tale that had appeared in a book and is now being adapted for an American television series. The work currently stars Aeneas Macaulay as Elisabeth, daughter of a prominent merchant. Her mother Tessa was also a famous actress, and Elisabeth is described by a number of women as the daughter of a prominent merchant. According to La R\u00e8vres, Elisabeth became married to her husband, Henry (Eddie), in 1853, and had a daughter born shortly thereafter. Although the relationship continued through both of their marriages, the next couple of years were spent in France, where they met at the theater. As La R\u00e8vres notes, the affair soon led to Meyerbeer and H.G. Wells having an affair, which ended in Wells getting married to a French woman, Mary Anne Macaulay in 1888, but both of them were able to remain friends and have very long careers together.\n\nMeyerbeer is, in fact, best known in Hollywood for his role as the villain in the most recent feature film,'The Muppet Show'(1978).\n\nThe following films have made their way into popular culture or have been adapted into series :","token_len":439,"entropy":[6.9627,11.2652,2.338,0.0883,9.7355,11.1027,6.364,3.1952,1.6365,7.5289,4.7156,0.483,7.4103,9.1423,12.4472,5.4101,3.4375,2.6075,13.4886,8.773,6.7814,9.4872,0.4293,3.9568,0.4779,1.7675,5.0087,2.0794,5.9484,2.6496,3.0341,2.6459,1.4889,1.9512,0.6636,3.2115,9.9046,9.2014,0.2854,1.9886,0.7814,2.1805,5.701,3.359,1.7139,0.892,3.4371,4.7805,2.5477,4.107,0.409,2.2554,1.2085,4.5746,5.5325,1.423,0.7319,4.0048,4.0203,1.8711,2.1491,4.8299,0.2619,3.5259,3.389,0.9717,0.1162,0.5133,5.5804,4.6404,3.4137,1.9724,0.7399,4.4026,2.2022,1.4391,4.4,0.0065,0.0066,0.8007,0.1341,3.2642,2.9982,4.1678,1.791,5.8348,4.2954,1.223,10.9064,7.7556,6.8819,3.0481,5.0918,5.4716,5.3914,4.5281,7.216,3.0062,1.4972,5.2592,0.7613,4.8004,0.7627,5.9465,2.9369,4.743,2.9323,3.4835,4.8248,3.4215,7.1528,1.4798,5.3857,5.2181,4.7877,5.2281,4.5965,7.2459,0.0779,2.9273,8.8247,0.3167,6.0745,1.2291,1.5103,5.5052,2.0864,0.1868,1.1756,0.687,1.7449,3.2051,5.0873,6.1367,0.5487,3.7453,1.3812,4.9082,5.2614,4.9532,1.1816,1.8259,3.6089,1.2178,3.7511,3.1957,3.2156,4.6027,1.1808,3.87,2.4925,3.3042,1.1202,3.5997,0.3649,0.6402,3.8867,6.2386,4.7303,1.0821,4.2603,2.2616,0.0051,0.0011,3.9514,0.8499,1.3551,1.2882,4.2234,0.0036,5.1259,0.2573,1.3868,2.8854,0.019,2.7824,0.0121,0.0468,0.697,4.5523,3.3748,3.9733,0.1423,3.0582,1.1929,1.5683,0.1676,1.4739,2.3412,4.4692,1.8383,0.0183,3.4157,5.7169,3.2264,3.9478,1.8658,0.1778,2.7618,4.1181,3.2776,3.9833,1.0201,2.4298,0.6803,1.287,2.7728,1.8642,2.3721,0.3894,0.3221,1.9044,4.5732,6.435,5.2072,5.6732,5.4586,0.0776,4.84,2.6085,0.0001,0.8123,5.8592,1.9145,0.0836,1.5758,5.1337,0.0385,1.5986,3.5597,3.7985,2.9762,2.8934,2.8237,6.6912,3.1963,3.2827,3.522,1.0135,3.6662,1.9193,0.9705,0.8721,4.6626,0.0104,0.0001,2.514,3.7436,1.6342,3.4823,4.9367,0.0018,4.5889,0.6374,2.4736,3.5708,0.0438,1.2221,2.2514,1.3293,0.9157,4.5223,0.0015,4.7924,4.4178,3.1237,2.6089,4.2342,0.8985,2.5118,0.0067,0.0002,3.9576,4.4177,0.343,3.5005,2.4274,1.5219,3.8655,3.8135,4.4569,3.2766,0.2168,1.7724,1.3784,0.6472,4.1141,0.862,0.6874,2.7057,1.6294,1.54,4.9148,4.238,0.8377,0.2965,4.7542,1.9107,4.5396,4.2686,3.1693,5.0727,1.8905,0.9266,1.8013,0.1571,1.9965,5.6272,3.1935,3.0725,0.6448,1.0685,3.9768,1.2003,4.0073,0.8818,0.8305,1.1754,2.6021,2.8982,0.9654,5.7364,1.7626,4.2861,3.368,0.4249,0.0093,0.0059,0.0057,2.3177,0.2451,1.825,5.7033,5.2115,3.3089,0.2015,3.5373,0.2451,3.8366,6.7966,1.5893,1.8362,0.0874,0.1331,3.7535,1.9385,0.0694,1.5138,1.8175,2.6964,0.6323,3.739,4.2122,0.8595,0.7294,2.3686,2.5157,1.9624,2.1072,4.9145,4.0199,5.2477,0.4969,0.0016,4.3637,6.2668,1.8612,3.9892,4.53,2.007,0.5338,2.1573,3.4679,0.0135,2.5722,2.7047,1.9443,2.9317,6.0474,3.5376,3.5858,1.3921,0.2218,1.0089,0.0003,1.9273,0.008,0.0016,0.007,2.4812,4.993,2.9076,1.5013,0.0014,4.3028,0.0694,2.9449,1.7782,0.5902,0.2891,2.2569,0.6559,2.2526,4.5737,1.5128,1.5064,5.5957,1.0422,4.7044,0.5988,9.3857,1.5011,4.4559,3.3646,0.5648,2.015,8.4576,5.3304,1.3174,3.0693,0.0003,2.6351,3.1651,3.5841,2.0822,4.3226,2.1149,0.4946,0.9355,4.9758,0.5382,4.4131,2.7403,0.9712,0.7555,1.3108,4.2815,5.5726]}
{"id":652,"ended":true,"length":418,"gen_text":"The game was expected to be an offensive struggle that could potentially break the then @ - @ record 74 points scored in the 1970 Peach Bowl. During the regular season, NC State lost six straight games in which the Badgers were able to put together an exceptional performance. With so much play on the lines, the Badgers looked to be heading in the right direction, despite a slight drop in the offensive standings. The first week of the season saw NC State run so many solid offensive plays during the early goings, and the momentum continued to roll towards the end of the season. The Badgers made their triumphant upset win over South Carolina State with two key performances: one in the first half and the one in the second half. A key part of our success was playing the defense of a defense coached by Mike Leach. South Carolina State did more than simply play good defense, giving the Badgers some tough plays against an easy schedule. The defense really proved that they can win big times, often with very good, well-constructed offense. After NC State led 14-2 late in the second half, a scoreless draw between the two teams was tied at 26. A three-point conversion on a breakaway by Will Johnson gave NC State the lead, but there was no real good counterplay in the series. During the third, the Badgers turned two long turnovers into two great opportunities: one went for a combined 12 points, and NC State closed the game on defense. NC State then opened the series on defense, playing two tough defense-oriented games with good offense, and closing out the game with an outstanding defensive effort for a team that won seven games in a row during the first half. The Badgers dominated the play during the first half on both occasions, as they opened the second half on both offensive possessions. The Badgers have not won a game in the regular season this season with the help of an extremely deep defense. At this point, NC State can't afford to be overconfident. The Badgers have been playing well, and with the addition of multiple key contributors, NC State has a chance to be top 10 caliber play at some point in the future.","token_len":442,"entropy":[6.8795,2.604,6.6941,0.0307,1.0117,4.5056,6.6725,5.6844,4.5929,2.8896,5.0609,5.3373,1.0441,9.6654,10.7963,11.2746,5.6164,9.1326,9.6547,2.0624,4.4402,1.4654,1.5047,8.1041,11.2807,0.1448,0.8352,6.3986,0.8029,4.4618,0.0186,0.4412,7.8547,0.1035,3.2685,4.6344,1.1961,1.0812,3.1576,2.6173,1.2155,4.9867,0.0014,2.1802,2.9522,0.0024,3.8381,1.8542,2.2216,5.4639,1.6673,0.5022,4.7559,4.8624,1.0273,5.5555,1.6768,0.3372,6.8222,0.5408,1.4123,1.1712,0.0024,4.2057,1.4667,1.3102,4.8702,1.0534,0.2487,0.2063,0.0025,2.5582,4.9159,2.3759,5.5434,2.4572,0.4983,1.8457,4.3546,4.9537,0.3748,2.1682,4.4931,4.0963,0.3237,0.2652,0.8387,1.236,2.1212,0.0028,5.7187,5.5582,0.5624,5.3758,2.1969,0.5504,4.9286,0.472,4.6512,6.8134,0.2182,2.2811,2.2446,1.8289,5.4241,4.1226,0.8305,3.9938,4.8717,0.3521,0.6441,0.4922,0.072,0.799,0.2297,1.8338,0.9889,0.0059,4.4326,2.7589,6.1831,7.5869,2.6663,0.2915,3.6369,0.1625,2.2301,4.566,4.1943,2.9806,4.478,2.7675,3.5283,2.1928,0.4622,2.0935,0.3557,1.6665,1.472,4.1354,1.1667,0.0534,0.2293,0.4487,0.5614,4.6528,3.2358,2.1442,0.092,5.4847,2.1468,1.4429,4.2794,2.1759,3.4101,3.7445,2.9733,3.1314,6.2469,0.0768,4.2284,3.4469,0.0445,1.1831,5.4179,0.0005,0.5991,3.8234,6.3708,0.5258,2.4907,2.793,3.9885,0.2984,1.095,6.705,1.9606,0.299,0.0068,3.8124,5.185,2.546,3.3895,4.4287,5.8717,3.0876,0.3286,1.6608,1.3431,5.4803,5.5735,1.9168,1.6074,2.3507,2.8608,4.3184,5.8309,2.0049,6.1738,2.4395,4.7951,1.956,5.2343,3.8176,0.9441,4.8081,0.2188,3.0653,0.2116,4.1918,4.8502,0.0007,4.7108,4.1205,0.0277,3.1306,3.7161,0.0298,0.0177,1.1941,0.3019,0.2458,3.6305,4.904,0.2961,0.9932,3.0789,1.3003,1.0932,0.1429,2.7247,4.7274,0.8913,5.0453,2.1492,4.0512,5.0022,0.3958,0.323,1.0143,3.1473,1.4264,4.0751,0.0341,1.2994,5.4724,3.2881,3.0265,0.8441,0.0018,1.1774,0.2094,1.6714,1.0151,5.2348,0.3297,1.5132,3.5036,5.739,5.1754,2.3784,2.854,0.2947,6.4134,0.245,5.5824,0.4018,1.8799,4.051,1.4959,0.72,0.0144,4.6221,5.2045,5.093,2.0724,0.5418,1.5646,4.9225,3.5605,4.6721,1.9437,6.4051,0.7227,0.5695,5.6621,4.1397,0.2052,0.8829,0.5639,4.4476,0.0029,5.5294,0.7928,0.795,2.2265,6.4618,1.6292,2.3981,0.0028,4.0226,4.6732,0.7004,2.4383,1.6985,1.7851,1.6125,5.0961,3.2716,4.9538,4.0521,2.8943,1.1471,2.3735,2.8935,3.9301,2.9876,2.436,1.7065,5.2729,2.0936,0.2492,0.9842,0.8681,2.7456,3.5374,3.7093,1.2862,5.4004,1.4683,2.7297,0.318,4.4459,3.845,1.9949,0.5651,0.2869,0.0002,4.0853,0.3489,3.943,0.4886,0.3757,1.6506,1.0809,0.0132,4.8117,0.7272,5.6224,4.7783,0.4589,2.1998,0.246,4.7062,1.8261,2.0041,0.282,3.3798,1.3799,4.868,0.6003,2.7078,0.2946,2.3063,2.9344,4.6675,2.862,0.9853,1.6167,1.2806,0.0119,5.1723,3.7799,1.5455,0.9863,1.2886,1.3018,1.0131,2.3133,0.0062,2.9218,0.4584,4.0609,2.5501,3.4106,0.0245,3.874,3.658,4.4861,1.1977,0.8865,4.9686,2.3782,0.2178,0.7081,2.1781,0.002,4.165,2.2529,1.447,0.0997,2.675,4.1942,1.799,0.0017,1.5583,1.94,1.0828,0.0123,1.746,2.2826,2.4475,2.9065,2.5657,1.2173,3.9548,1.8381,4.375,0.0024,5.7708,2.9254,2.0682,0.9372,2.903,0.0011,2.1408,1.8431,1.21,0.1522,1.6106,4.3254,1.6867,5.9977,5.7702,3.0373,2.5361,0.0146,1.0893,0.1611,1.0281,0.0784]}
{"id":1117,"ended":false,"length":407,"gen_text":"Having struggled for appearances with Stoke since their promotion to the Premier League, Cresswell joined Championship outfit Sheffield United on a three @ - @ month loan on 29 September 2009 and made his senior debut in the home opener against Crystal Palace on 3 January 2010.\n\nWith his form in the lower half of the season dwindling, Cresswell's new-counters have been quick to point out the lacklustre quality that is the hallmark of his game. In all his first six starts of the season he has only played on the right wing and struggled to produce at times. With his game having fallen further behind this season, he has spent most of the campaign in central midfield. With the addition of Juan Mata, who recently had surgery on his left shoulder, with Cresswell having recently switched to a striker role, Cresswell's options have been limited with the former Manchester City and Fulham player out with a groin injury. In recent weeks, Chelsea's captain, Alejandro Bedoya, has had to deal with an injury to a number of the midfield players who have failed to impress during the season so far.\n\nDespite his quality, Cresswell is still on a long waiting list for some international call-ups. There are signs that his performance at Blackpool earlier in the month could be the beginning of one of those occasions, however, which will see him move to the wing. Having moved into the game as a substitute against Sunderland in the first quarter and at West Brom earlier in the season, the 17-year-old has managed just two Premier League goals in his last nine league appearances. Whilst his record this term has been lacking, Cresswell shows no signs of fading from form after having just 15 league goals in 24 league games this term. When looking at his defensive record, his performances at St Mary's, Arsenal and at the club level suggest that he isn't quite on par with his form at Arsenal yet. On paper, Cresswell's form this term could be a step above the rest of the Premier League and if his form with the Blues remains consistent, he could start for Arsenal or at Liverpool.\n\nThis story originally appeared on Forbes Magazine","token_len":442,"entropy":[9.5578,2.485,9.4491,2.7964,5.6855,3.6337,3.617,3.4237,0.8605,0.4253,0.3592,0.0031,1.1812,5.4249,4.2156,0.0407,5.6091,6.5641,4.2884,5.8527,1.3672,1.454,0.7896,2.7622,19.5064,9.4126,5.0971,8.8086,2.2111,5.5777,5.4921,3.68,5.0861,2.5233,3.2273,1.1543,3.0908,0.0738,1.5129,0.6626,5.5943,3.3088,0.9978,3.4322,0.001,0.5763,3.7769,3.0782,0.367,0.2617,0.9699,0.0036,4.3425,2.6475,4.3151,2.5051,1.0286,5.7688,3.4776,0.1201,0.149,1.4805,3.9495,0.5387,0.7742,0.0011,0.0005,2.7998,4.769,4.5497,6.6474,6.6741,2.9307,1.5893,5.5417,0.0994,2.0038,0.8943,2.3032,3.8803,2.6693,0.0038,4.2232,2.5936,3.2825,3.3353,2.2241,0.0242,1.2013,2.828,0.37,3.4435,4.3351,2.7311,3.1469,3.8296,3.1977,3.4161,0.2903,0.312,2.0018,0.8384,2.9125,2.9226,4.3312,1.9738,1.3291,1.5297,1.763,5.7695,0.6005,4.0016,3.3664,1.6944,1.1279,3.667,2.0999,5.2997,4.1702,2.4398,3.6281,0.8051,4.5051,0.2683,0.4396,1.6532,0.7445,5.4823,1.5788,0.018,0.6914,3.4727,2.1836,2.6447,0.477,1.8262,3.2405,1.6676,3.6256,0.0013,5.7827,0.2578,1.0326,2.7374,5.3556,4.8084,3.6981,0.877,0.2889,1.5645,2.1735,0.4912,5.7017,2.7041,0.015,0.0006,3.4241,4.8221,4.5227,0.5311,2.1883,5.402,0.2851,0.5678,1.9647,0.0201,0.0009,2.1793,4.975,1.0512,0.967,0.6022,4.0996,1.8319,4.6928,2.6648,1.151,1.723,5.3613,0.0,2.4932,5.3964,3.4229,0.4451,3.2221,0.3417,0.2531,4.2192,4.558,0.7563,1.0087,6.3527,2.2377,4.7012,2.6335,5.661,1.8389,0.1814,0.0005,0.3542,0.2959,3.9566,1.1288,2.9567,0.0137,3.0215,1.6322,1.2089,4.0774,2.7909,0.0027,3.1054,3.3016,2.5261,2.5231,0.7517,4.597,0.0844,1.9106,3.3799,1.3733,1.9383,3.0954,0.0335,0.491,0.6981,0.0002,3.4882,1.4456,5.3959,0.6938,0.656,0.0008,0.0012,1.7214,1.6489,4.6202,1.7397,2.7473,6.4629,0.0023,0.526,5.4052,3.8247,5.2334,0.0829,0.0668,0.816,4.8055,1.5074,3.9931,0.3606,2.6152,5.7622,2.2595,5.7277,0.0268,5.4394,2.0412,0.1156,2.6509,1.9423,1.1108,2.6131,2.3684,0.0683,5.8479,0.8505,0.5209,4.0134,2.2506,2.8505,1.0901,5.6699,2.6486,2.7078,0.4156,3.4705,1.0413,1.0376,3.2344,1.7152,3.8807,4.9625,2.9549,0.6528,6.0134,2.093,0.5977,3.2158,2.9001,3.2727,1.7996,0.8919,2.8876,5.7157,4.2141,4.6446,4.6417,0.5434,3.423,0.3249,0.0272,1.1074,0.191,2.8236,5.1815,0.169,0.0023,0.0284,0.0009,1.145,5.4131,0.817,2.1476,2.4489,0.002,1.4026,1.0214,0.9185,0.7631,2.8279,2.161,0.5404,0.7394,4.5508,1.9593,4.8463,5.1059,3.1831,1.7086,0.6205,4.9502,0.5969,1.5941,0.0012,0.0012,5.9528,2.494,0.2988,0.0356,3.6215,3.219,3.7931,4.5279,3.9494,3.3804,4.4542,1.5011,0.6393,0.8461,4.5308,1.9789,1.5322,1.542,0.6441,0.1813,6.1396,3.9327,0.2399,0.6831,5.2022,1.9119,0.917,2.8588,4.2257,2.6301,4.9984,0.7187,0.0125,2.8964,4.279,0.4223,4.3157,3.2947,2.7035,1.2132,2.1299,0.6512,0.6389,5.7872,0.0005,2.3294,3.4734,2.7833,0.475,1.0136,3.5834,1.0424,4.3486,4.8108,0.4448,5.4247,3.452,0.3181,1.4745,0.0013,0.0015,1.4759,3.0404,4.1844,0.4027,2.9866,0.8313,1.6664,4.849,3.4155,1.616,2.4879,0.6215,0.5291,1.953,0.0014,3.0467,3.7979,2.6894,1.8116,6.1805,1.4853,4.864,3.1648,2.6194,0.6127,0.8495,0.3392,5.0766,1.8321,3.083,3.839,2.412,4.3359,0.7269,0.3976,0.0002,4.9176,4.8818,2.5531,0.0539,0.4942,5.4979,4.2293]}

The play clock ended on Peters running into a field position with Florida State trailing 26-14.\nThe third play would give the Tide a three and down advantage in the second half.\nFlorida State pulled within 15-10 the rest of the way on a two yard run by Barnett that would have been his seventh of the season.\nThe Gators finished with 26-3 with a 7 \u2013 0 run game to give them their largest lead of the game at one point.\nThe Tide will play Georgia at 3 p.m. ET this Saturday, and with the SEC Championship going on this Thursday, you know we could be seeing a good team play at some point in the season.","token_len":442,"entropy":[3.4603,10.0963,2.0998,1.2677,4.3511,3.4264,8.0988,2.8485,1.9233,0.2553,3.1236,2.9071,2.4728,3.7589,0.1135,3.7678,8.9561,4.2999,1.6419,3.8444,6.2398,0.5154,2.0652,1.189,0.3376,5.8602,15.2859,7.3967,8.5601,9.1922,13.2693,7.4519,3.8062,0.0599,6.1488,3.3248,5.5325,4.4654,3.7662,5.6103,0.5784,3.0371,0.2756,0.6937,1.8928,10.8226,0.5395,1.4863,3.6222,0.699,1.8,1.4495,0.5865,0.6783,0.6835,2.2345,5.537,5.5512,4.0695,1.1725,1.8616,1.4389,0.8336,5.9475,4.8916,0.7696,0.8808,1.8145,1.4546,0.0012,2.4701,1.7057,2.6142,5.2506,2.4053,4.9963,0.3665,5.3462,0.7971,3.815,6.0599,0.9807,3.2542,0.8737,5.3393,3.2948,3.0403,0.9634,1.1556,0.9095,4.8424,3.4908,2.2972,0.5648,2.6447,0.8586,1.6851,6.7412,0.0472,2.0928,1.7498,3.3218,2.3304,2.4766,4.6766,1.2321,3.1083,0.8593,5.0067,0.0614,0.8428,4.902,1.0163,1.8962,5.0318,2.2184,0.9274,0.4321,1.3405,3.9507,4.2524,1.2984,3.8551,0.0489,3.073,1.2757,1.6155,4.8318,2.9498,1.8204,0.5135,1.4526,0.0882,1.2865,0.6774,0.9604,0.8368,5.1092,2.8104,3.9602,2.9931,3.1562,0.5558,2.2775,2.7479,1.224,2.1941,0.1854,0.0263,2.4574,3.28,6.0038,0.0147,2.8234,3.4711,0.1734,2.8699,1.6087,4.78,3.1372,5.2869,1.7036,0.3394,0.3821,0.6108,4.5088,1.2725,4.3768,1.6592,0.0022,1.2331,5.3666,5.829,1.4184,0.9398,3.1608,2.5009,0.002,1.5103,3.5399,0.0686,2.1487,0.6577,2.8329,0.7791,0.0859,1.4817,0.3684,7.1298,0.0023,2.7319,4.601,2.2328,4.1063,5.2602,5.366,2.4845,0.6826,3.0581,0.7812,6.9026,0.884,3.4885,5.4832,4.0322,0.885,0.9115,4.8932,2.3455,2.6849,5.2232,4.4566,2.2962,2.8641,1.5612,3.3147,0.6533,0.7698,0.5051,0.0101,0.44,0.3641,0.3192,5.3185,1.3472,2.9506,3.4979,3.2791,2.5299,1.2742,4.3806,0.3195,2.3546,0.4626,2.8662,1.4356,3.4776,0.5327,3.3908,3.164,1.7725,0.5286,5.1262,4.7491,3.4122,2.7598,1.2045,5.8365,2.0027,4.5613,7.2609,5.6411,5.3204,0.835,4.1094,3.6634,4.5565,0.3305,5.901,1.5062,1.8282,5.7116,0.6795,3.7937,0.6222,0.8943,0.3647,3.6375,0.4217,1.5243,5.5053,0.9054,1.9442,5.1682,2.2038,3.2296,1.8752,0.7198,3.44,4.4287,0.2564,0.2452,0.816,2.5686,1.0236,0.5017,2.2615,4.4643,1.6106,3.1351,0.8877,0.5107,4.4088,4.9729,0.561,1.4512,1.1678,4.7264,4.3724,2.6992,0.4771,0.6173,2.848,2.3464,3.2755,5.7149,3.5485,2.9118,4.9141,4.7461,4.1563,2.1157,3.3528,5.872,3.0085,4.881,0.1591,2.7311,4.9372,0.2355,2.267,0.7651,0.3324,1.8397,4.1717,2.665,4.9605,2.9622,1.2041,1.4584,0.8182,5.3892,4.125,4.0046,2.7246,2.594,0.2066,2.1529,0.3359,0.8132,0.7831,3.0494,0.0732,5.2539,1.8925,4.3615,1.5379,2.9441,6.0393,1.749,0.0017,0.0091,0.0201,3.2585,1.4058,3.4688,1.5699,0.5972,0.5196,1.6993,3.2191,1.833,0.6072,2.0773,4.6062,4.8994,1.2254,0.0153,0.8346,0.6132,0.3719,1.6671,2.7316,4.8536,1.108,5.2457,4.2951,5.2232,2.9777,2.951,4.5114,0.364,2.7443,2.7516,3.1542,2.0616,2.8104,0.7111,1.2275,5.9425,0.2794,0.2226,0.0164,0.4344,2.2328,3.5855,0.4839,0.3823,0.1361,1.6438,2.3383,4.7596,2.8922,2.8216,2.5453,3.5791,0.9948,0.0011,0.0001,0.028,1.6327,4.8922,0.9344,2.1482,1.8915,5.1149,1.4704,3.8938,0.4453,5.2454,0.4295,4.1971,4.4208,0.8931,4.0153,4.1589,4.4408,4.8471,1.2651,1.1039,1.3828,3.722,3.4258,3.0855,2.8034,3.2346,0.2497,1.6887,0.1685,1.7459,0.1473]}

Initial studies predicted bedrock would be six feet below sea level over the short term, although new sediment and natural gas sources suggested there might be more water in lower sedimentary rocks than expected, although those concerns seem to have been tested several time.\n\nThis latest research is significant because it shows that even if we do not have all the elements and techniques of today to build pipelines in the near future, much less at present, the environmental and health risks were actually significant in the 1970s and 1980s.

The potential for adverse health effects has increased in the years immediately after 9\/11 and even after recent expansions of the pipeline from Gulf states and the Gulf provinces. In addition, there appears to be a significant and growing threat to oil and natural gas facilities during the Gulf period... This may contribute significantly to the global carbon pollution and the subsequent environmental degradation from the impacts of the construction of such pipelines.\n\n\"....

The projected increase in this risk increases with the increase in the flow of the Gulfstream over the Gulf region.\",\n\nThis is clear evidence that we can begin building these pipelines without the heavy human intervention at least in part because of our efforts to protect our nation from the effects of global warming by taking the right steps on our part, as noted above, but with an eye to protecting people, businesses and their well-being in the case of a future global warming catastrophe, where we might begin to see more and greater losses of life for American lives by the amount of carbon dioxide emitted out of this system and the pollution produced by the coal, gas, oil, gas, natural gas and fossil fuels we have used over billions of years of our lives.\n\nThe article concludes the following:","token_len":445,"entropy":[12.8239,0.6205,8.867,3.9917,1.77,2.4555,6.1081,3.7679,0.0171,0.5683,6.4175,0.7947,2.3918,6.486,1.9412,2.1425,5.2359,5.924,0.5144,7.6097,10.0853,0.0019,9.6807,0.9155,0.4086,1.3189,4.8792,0.0027,9.7123,1.1791,9.7729,3.7661,6.5999,12.3322,3.2969,0.6451,6.5667,0.8864,1.8702,1.3577,0.009,5.6174,0.6388,6.011,0.4147,0.7718,4.6768,5.3007,5.0844,3.2959,5.2854,1.0273,4.2689,4.1567,3.9196,1.4597,0.1961,2.0241,3.4175,2.2905,6.5616,4.3626,1.9533,1.9602,1.4527,2.3876,2.6359,5.4072,4.6787,5.1064,6.7905,0.3256,0.3051,0.3339,4.5632,6.1276,6.135,0.5611,1.2441,0.0005,4.7057,4.3655,4.3304,2.7301,5.3102,0.6921,0.4982,2.0436,0.5157,4.202,1.6673,4.179,3.2554,0.7177,2.6592,5.0673,0.4186,5.3717,4.3377,4.5088,4.4872,4.2031,3.8323,3.044,2.9054,3.1709,0.8576,3.6237,0.0344,0.1008,6.3742,4.6514,5.4724,2.2902,0.1747,1.6943,4.5507,3.1741,2.9963,1.4456,6.9475,5.4651,4.9016,2.2814,0.5296,3.5717,0.028,0.9653,0.3911,0.0001,0.5061,3.2954,3.6149,4.3053,3.9863,4.959,4.7889,0.9346,4.5689,1.853,1.5862,5.4114,5.3273,2.3515,0.0015,0.5006,5.8237,5.1499,0.1895,0.0173,3.9195,1.1566,2.4711,1.2359,0.0002,1.0827,1.5337,3.9132,2.7113,4.2447,1.3524,1.9871,0.5086,2.0316,0.3203,0.0045,1.5762,4.0347,7.1889,2.3682,4.0931,1.1301,4.9526,1.9415,0.4184,3.6538,2.571,2.9521,1.0378,2.5537,3.9547,1.5733,0.8389,0.0053,0.0015,2.0798,4.6463,1.8138,4.7597,5.1384,0.6973,1.0994,2.3306,4.6495,3.4873,1.9911,3.2472,2.0534,1.5172,6.6699,1.8414,2.8958,1.7556,0.1798,2.5871,4.3382,0.0303,0.0977,1.0494,2.5972,4.1205,1.2767,3.725,0.9393,5.5814,0.8457,1.9574,0.0074,5.571,6.0702,0.8673,3.3824,3.9139,4.4308,3.506,4.7978,4.8178,3.226,0.0222,0.7245,4.8908,5.831,3.1887,2.5526,2.9479,4.8688,4.06,1.9891,4.765,1.6928,4.9485,0.2598,1.7969,5.1231,0.3868,4.0912,0.9199,1.9691,1.325,0.0002,0.8371,9.7022,4.3299,4.6116,0.2965,4.8889,6.6029,3.299,0.0186,2.5756,0.934,2.6869,1.9208,3.3504,3.3726,3.1846,2.1374,0.7729,5.0283,0.1002,2.7151,0.2259,0.6706,0.2935,0.8479,1.7107,1.5429,5.1183,0.013,3.2333,1.1971,1.8968,0.582,6.1653,4.0354,2.0763,5.4632,2.94,0.2476,4.5512,2.6478,5.0328,2.2885,1.1637,4.0611,0.081,1.1554,4.6102,0.5091,2.5735,1.1917,5.2574,5.8154,0.2993,1.3894,4.4929,10.8489,2.3948,0.0002,3.3589,1.6683,5.5559,0.4983,0.5238,2.9102,2.5977,5.2186,3.2099,4.2736,0.686,3.2543,2.1977,5.6309,4.3667,2.7975,5.3658,4.117,1.6018,0.795,1.0976,0.9809,2.8081,4.0118,0.5263,2.0858,1.3563,3.8363,2.0664,1.2719,2.0999,0.0266,2.6528,0.1156,5.4461,4.5697,2.523,4.4746,1.2046,4.6456,2.1141,0.7781,2.4908,3.2797,5.3339,1.3199,1.5532,2.6193,3.4829,3.8656,2.4497,1.7852,3.6597,5.1568,2.6529,4.4288,0.6798,3.756,4.449,0.12,0.0054,3.1421,0.5519,5.266,0.0856,2.713,2.7018,3.1625,1.0627,2.4922,3.0956,4.8677,1.842,4.1374,5.1585,0.7342,2.5682,3.0015,1.2667,4.735,5.6705,1.1571,0.5388,5.1531,4.9203,3.0054,4.5077,1.7275,5.3878,0.1584,1.8133,1.3655,2.4544,6.4511,0.1011,3.3168,3.3371,3.4453,2.02,4.6529,4.1449,0.5221,1.2868,5.5734,2.0346,2.2649,1.0233,0.2356,1.1663,2.0228,1.3305,3.2409,0.0036,0.5005,2.8309,0.8974,2.8119,4.0119,4.083,4.2916,6.6843,0.0341,0.0473,3.9961,2.0057,2.3205,0.4943,0.3976,0.0002,2.1616,5.176,3.2317,4.8983,1.4995,0.6815]}

{"id":361,"ended":false,"length":391,"gen_text":"Lock Haven was laid out as a town in 1833, and it became the county seat in 1839, when the county was created out of parts of Lycoming and Centre counties. Incorporated in 1850 as the Charles County of South Carolina, the town was incorporated at the turn of the 19th century. In 1854 the County was renamed the Town of Rockcreek. The town was renamed the State of North Carolina in 1955.\n\nHistory Edit\n\nThe town was formed and built on the site of an older, more abandoned house, and later incorporated into the state of North Carolina, and became the new City of Woodland Park in 1957. In 1969, The City of Woodland Park became the home of the state fair and recreation center, the William E. Woodland Park Visitor Center for the Fair & Recreational Society, a large theme park with 20 million visitors annually and a 30,000+ park pass (both federal and state-licensed).\n\nIn 1972, the Town of Rockcreek, known as the \"Hillwoods,\" became a part of the City of Woodland Park as it was part of the county's redevelopment plan. Later in 1994, Town of Rockcreek was renamed Rockcreek Park and renamed the State of North Carolina (SC.) in 1998.\n\nHistory Edit\n\nIn 1968, the town was also named Rockcreek Park National Historic site under the name of Town of Rockcreek.\n\nThere are no historical records of the town or Rockcreek Park at this time.\n\nWhen the town was built in 1837, three small stone towers were built on one side of the road and seven on the other side. The first tower was erected in 1592. The second was built in 1861. The third tower in 1888 was named for an older house in a little village in the Rock Creek area in South Carolina, and was called the Town House in 1910. All three were built on houses at that time.\n\nSince the first building was constructed during the same year (1852-1870), it was possible that some years prior, Rockcreek Park had been built under a different designation.\n\nGallery Edit","token_len":446,"entropy":[11.8662,4.4807,7.3204,1.0332,2.6612,0.6461,6.5802,2.7849,2.6212,4.5272,1.3366,1.6064,2.8499,3.2653,1.5097,5.5747,0.8663,3.302,0.5201,2.5799,1.8302,2.0675,1.5076,2.9032,2.2508,4.7824,6.8512,0.0038,7.1391,0.1138,8.7112,1.9452,1.0389,8.9808,2.8777,0.5522,9.4019,1.5807,1.4976,4.1204,2.5884,1.2885,5.8859,0.551,1.7517,3.9425,0.4716,0.2368,1.2652,0.7584,1.472,2.8452,4.3285,1.2356,3.7775,0.008,0.0373,1.6913,0.0096,0.0735,0.7805,2.8942,0.9358,2.8982,1.6168,5.1146,1.8404,2.0516,1.4577,3.8944,0.0976,5.2813,6.3926,0.7695,1.5475,1.9245,1.6851,1.5578,2.3619,0.8562,3.8048,1.1378,2.3779,0.0323,1.1789,4.0465,0.6416,1.0352,0.0025,3.8718,2.6482,0.0123,0.0002,1.5094,1.014,0.8953,3.0745,5.2901,3.2256,2.0692,0.8124,1.6247,0.0194,2.9757,5.1849,3.261,2.4061,5.1531,4.3413,2.1582,3.1704,3.6334,3.4962,0.5547,0.4181,1.9413,1.1742,0.17,0.0047,2.7616,3.4248,3.3463,1.0355,5.354,4.3785,0.1581,4.1983,2.419,2.2385,1.1219,3.3386,0.16,2.7686,3.4843,1.137,5.6303,2.3935,0.2379,0.2918,0.0075,0.0396,2.2226,0.5052,4.2493,0.1693,0.6367,3.1796,4.4295,2.0597,3.8569,0.9987,1.4383,1.5142,5.5441,2.4328,0.0463,3.6256,0.8214,0.6788,5.055,0.0014,0.1,5.3597,1.024,5.0155,4.9899,3.9005,0.031,4.1288,0.5899,3.8932,5.143,4.9348,0.0224,3.2337,5.5897,5.6462,1.2058,1.4728,2.5658,1.4642,5.7682,0.8886,0.0292,4.4559,3.0798,4.9515,4.4811,5.0933,5.1142,0.0861,0.1411,3.3951,3.1874,0.598,1.144,0.0002,2.1297,2.6406,0.4415,0.7476,1.9878,0.2395,1.4681,0.0438,0.0002,3.6059,4.7851,0.4796,0.7629,2.3264,5.4221,6.1687,1.8252,2.0068,1.8845,2.4269,0.0039,0.4321,4.8218,0.0835,0.5829,0.0099,0.0382,3.336,2.5025,1.0849,3.3747,0.005,0.433,3.8001,1.5221,5.4646,0.5379,0.7919,5.9165,2.3084,4.8501,0.2321,5.4622,0.3853,0.0747,0.0021,0.0002,0.8889,1.6855,2.8785,1.0628,0.0016,1.9554,2.3853,2.2559,0.9932,2.2369,1.119,0.0345,0.0017,5.1945,4.1963,6.2179,1.4038,3.5488,0.3238,0.6801,0.0002,2.6054,0.3415,0.0079,0.0002,1.6189,4.2751,0.1934,0.8014,1.5997,0.7912,5.5418,1.5247,2.8771,0.381,0.0008,0.629,5.6067,0.7875,4.4725,5.6944,0.4618,2.4977,0.5381,4.0422,0.2374,0.2643,0.0208,0.0002,1.3061,1.3458,0.0002,6.0207,1.3303,3.1086,2.8765,0.7709,0.8433,0.6513,1.14,2.739,4.0016,0.0041,0.0009,0.9005,3.6896,0.5821,0.1016,0.3655,0.5972,0.0002,5.124,0.8242,1.5907,0.43,2.6121,1.0671,0.743,3.6616,0.1753,6.7133,4.2383,4.499,3.9891,0.732,1.3979,1.4906,5.2869,0.8321,0.1486,0.1494,3.8625,2.3132,5.4426,1.0527,0.0283,0.0194,0.9339,0.9126,1.136,2.1503,0.9759,0.6414,3.5815,0.8548,6.0559,3.7235,1.9048,1.0721,1.1053,1.4163,0.8518,0.1649,5.5502,1.0095,0.6932,0.1687,0.8877,2.8426,4.982,0.6688,4.423,2.2886,3.7665,3.9618,1.8138,2.351,4.8315,5.3859,2.8819,1.7839,1.0468,5.1486,1.5264,1.1568,3.8043,2.8831,0.0518,2.2091,2.018,1.0132,3.1225,0.9801,1.9936,4.1765,2.2736,4.6069,0.2545,5.6141,1.3103,2.0285,2.0906,2.3561,6.229,3.8335,3.4083,0.0437,0.7204,0.6945,0.0002,5.3403,1.0883,4.0149,2.513,1.2753,2.8736,5.8601,0.3782,5.1518,1.1624,3.87,0.482,4.649,3.4341,1.5069,5.1395,0.1468,2.6817,2.0867,3.9927,1.51,2.9958,4.859,2.7529,2.6744,1.6939,0.01,0.0004,0.7631,1.2348,0.6294,2.0423,4.5951,1.6737,0.7466,4.2632,0.6869,1.4933,0.0002,5.0563,0.0156]}

Stocksbridge's highest ever league attendance against their rivals is 610 for a match against Worksop. = = Players''' Stocksbridge is known to have produced some of the most successful men's professional football clubs with all its great colours. Its football is the only football-like game anywhere in the world played by a recognised professional football outfit and is one of the four national football events held each year and is the only team ever to play in a game between 10 and 30 minutes long. However, it is also widely regarded as the strongest professional football club in the country with two of the five highest scores of the season being taken home by Stocksbridge at 13\/5. Sticksborough was the first of three teams coached by Mike Ellis at Stocksbridge to have been promoted to the Championship in 1958 and he won the League Cup twice, including in 1962. The new league's first club, and the first league-winning team, were never beaten in a League Cup final.\n\nThe new manager has said the coaching style of Garry Monk has given Ross Barkley a great opportunity to become the head coach of the Championship as it means Swansea, Arsenal and Liverpool are the only teams from that region to have made it to the next round of the League Cup. When asked if he thinks the two teams will co-exist there will be no relegation, Monk replied: \"If we don't manage to win the league we're going to lose the division.\" It will leave both clubs at a position of weakness. As the game's first official match, the tie will come down at three o'clock in the evening on Saturday, with Swansea and Arsenal then taking on the teams from Swansea and Liverpool. The title is in danger of being tipped away at the top when the final whistle blows, with Stopsbridge having to lose three of its previous four matches before they are set to meet Stokes at the London Stadium.\n\n* * *\n\nFootball is just starting to take off in Wales with the emergence of the new manager, Ross Barkley, which could bring an end to any hopes of an unbalanced Welsh football.","token_len":448,"entropy":[10.0414,4.9754,10.0237,4.3835,9.2167,11.174,7.2148,3.776,7.2484,1.5447,0.1323,6.9543,2.3143,3.0489,2.0817,9.0756,3.8949,1.2546,6.5324,5.4707,5.3323,3.3614,7.4582,5.2681,6.6657,2.5532,8.0429,4.864,1.8952,1.6959,10.2465,5.6989,3.2744,2.4369,2.0003,11.2151,0.0171,2.3054,12.0361,4.1322,10.916,11.6307,3.4151,6.9657,0.0978,0.1207,3.7638,4.4797,2.5326,1.4323,5.1417,2.0476,0.1875,0.1438,1.5449,2.2528,4.7095,0.2279,4.4446,1.0895,2.2817,5.4442,5.4675,3.6712,5.0476,5.6863,1.6813,4.6317,3.2362,3.3807,3.5061,3.6376,3.2961,5.9662,3.475,1.4274,5.5981,0.2433,0.6421,0.6055,5.2988,1.5471,1.5782,5.2345,1.1041,1.2937,4.0292,2.5769,2.2032,3.2968,0.083,0.218,5.978,3.7492,2.0849,4.7752,1.6976,2.9217,0.1072,5.1287,2.0085,2.3202,1.3446,4.5239,4.5626,0.4921,1.9293,1.1466,2.1193,4.369,3.9373,5.513,1.1364,2.4751,0.8859,2.7189,0.2603,6.0807,0.2465,2.3596,0.7709,1.7238,5.5474,1.1619,0.18,1.2108,5.2648,4.2544,0.2473,1.0237,0.1842,0.5423,1.864,2.0547,5.2065,1.6511,0.5723,3.115,1.6968,3.4215,2.2887,2.6403,1.6316,2.1073,3.0734,4.7924,0.3759,2.1857,0.0976,0.0019,3.898,5.5457,3.8523,3.858,1.0741,3.5082,6.9538,2.6291,4.7478,2.0032,1.8392,3.4544,2.5582,1.6901,5.5315,0.1138,5.2023,5.8584,2.6525,1.0895,0.904,0.0064,2.8952,2.7464,2.8574,1.9429,0.5211,0.533,3.1333,1.28,4.7043,1.9914,4.7829,2.9348,0.9407,4.0257,1.1754,3.4117,2.7861,3.8599,1.6634,2.3259,0.9579,2.134,4.6079,3.7819,4.5289,1.9551,5.6103,0.8929,5.5359,1.9354,0.6764,4.3254,3.2848,2.2385,1.5271,1.5594,2.2536,5.5211,4.1316,1.549,2.1175,3.5809,0.0214,1.7062,1.351,4.2112,0.0051,2.4621,4.1279,5.259,3.5375,3.2386,2.3888,6.1659,3.1162,1.3703,5.7534,1.3124,1.9199,4.2134,5.8507,3.6377,1.5002,3.5786,2.577,0.2223,3.7367,1.4587,4.584,0.0882,0.6237,1.2178,4.2251,5.2488,3.6311,4.6,7.1315,3.5836,5.4862,0.4626,2.6317,1.73,3.3363,0.7721,1.6699,5.1464,3.9402,2.4095,0.8595,1.2478,3.9668,0.8916,0.4548,0.1445,3.782,0.8259,0.9083,0.1284,4.1247,0.1464,0.5947,6.7746,1.0855,1.3316,0.9266,3.0969,1.8586,5.7742,2.2236,1.3784,5.9893,0.1685,0.2574,4.8819,1.954,0.1615,1.7374,6.2224,2.2374,1.5002,2.0217,0.2238,0.147,3.8987,1.4635,2.7996,0.0013,4.1798,0.7661,1.3621,1.3376,1.5177,1.8038,2.6677,1.2011,0.0344,2.0848,0.9401,5.2715,1.8575,5.0174,2.2774,5.1899,3.9873,1.8611,3.6947,2.1451,4.5407,1.3093,3.2194,1.9101,5.2134,2.3835,4.3653,2.7584,3.6556,3.6732,3.4548,1.5634,1.5041,4.1769,1.5164,4.3678,1.703,4.1579,6.0174,2.0942,0.0118,0.0013,1.9641,0.0177,2.0132,2.7175,1.7227,1.6572,2.9895,2.8046,1.9273,0.5597,5.5321,2.6048,0.5167,1.9194,4.5928,0.5891,4.8452,0.9759,1.6041,1.0474,2.512,5.1745,2.722,4.0324,3.3639,0.5602,0.5034,4.1395,3.9568,2.7954,0.9163,3.3676,4.8259,1.3727,3.0722,0.3862,0.3848,2.3289,1.0982,3.1837,6.376,0.3184,2.7844,2.6088,4.8964,3.4319,1.081,1.6768,3.5977,0.4345,1.6677,3.2851,2.5681,1.8817,4.4301,0.2601,3.7836,2.9537,2.5369,2.504,1.1895,5.4667,0.3397,0.7723,1.0186,0.0003,5.5065,2.0476,0.0033,0.7821,0.0002,5.5577,2.7397,5.1574,4.353,0.2621,1.8725,0.8964,0.8204,2.0295,3.5884,1.2347,4.9053,0.0101,1.6434,2.148,4.7909,1.4009,1.7182,0.0725,0.9061,4.6457,3.7637,3.8691,3.5393,0.4839,0.0047,4.3533,1.6867,0.332,3.2833,4.7463,2.5606,3.0638,1.5441,1.4876]}

It was never our intention however to have the Italian driver driven on a track without his team being aware of it.'\n\nFerrari's car also went through a major technical failure - as it spun out of control at one of the corners of Monza (pictured earlier) - prompting a safety investigation\n\n'I'm absolutely furious. I feel for the rest of the team now and hope I will do my best to explain to them the facts as quickly as possible. I am committed to winning today but I have spent a lot of time trying to get the game clear, understand all the issues and look at the facts to come out at Monaco next Tuesday.'\n\nHe also said that if necessary Ferrari, who have also been under pressure from F1 chief Jean Todt for his handling, could appeal.\n\nFerrari have not won a grand prix since 1998 when they were 12th in the world standings.\n\nThe Ferrari 545 will take on the BMW 498 GTO.

{"id":2191,"ended":false,"length":410,"gen_text":"June to August are the winter months in Buenos Aires. Winters are cold with mild temperatures during the day and cold nights. Highs during the season average 16 @. @ 3 \u00b0C and 20 @.... 22 C or higher. During winter months, temperatures around 7C lower during the day and 5C lower when the season is short. Highs at the time typically occur on April to May with high temperatures during October and November during December and January after January and February.\n\nThe National Weather Service reported that high temperatures have occurred in Argentina at times of low humidity, such as in April to June, when temperatures are relatively hot. High temperatures in Argentina can also be experienced during the summer when temperatures are low and wind is strong.\n\nThe National Disaster Management Plan (NEM), or National Disaster Management Plan, was developed under the leadership of President Raul Castro, which was signed into law in August 1983 by President Raul Castro's predecessor, President Salvador Allende.\n\nThe NEM was an attempt to reduce the risk to residents who have been living in substandard conditions through increased sanitation and emergency facilities, as well as by implementing a variety of other policies. As of 2000, the NEM had about 4,000 workers from 3 cities. From 2002 to 2004, the City of Albuquerque became the first municipality to implement its own emergency response plan based on the NEM.\n\nIn December 2004, Albuquerque developed an emergency response strategy by implementing an 8.5-mile national highway system that had over 1,500 local agencies. The NEM would also provide local community health officials with an inventory of municipal and municipal-level systems providing food, shelter, fuel, telephone, utilities, water and electricity. The plan was implemented on a budget of $33 million for 2010.\n\nAs of 2005, the Federal government in Buenos Aires had increased its spending for emergency response on the National Disaster Management Plan (NEM). At this time, the central government in Buenos Aires was not using the budget it had appropriated. There was little public discussion about the program, given that some public agencies objected to spending nearly half of the cost of the plan, which was over $2.0 billion.\n\nBibliography","token_len":449,"entropy":[4.3957,3.6718,6.8005,2.7,8.0156,1.1721,2.5675,10.3065,0.0002,1.5114,11.6631,0.4084,1.0129,4.2131,3.562,5.1842,2.8787,4.5883,0.6515,2.9522,1.0337,3.1152,2.3466,2.8195,6.3787,4.7088,4.4382,0.4403,4.7087,8.023,5.6004,12.0782,5.555,8.5449,5.5889,4.0773,0.0909,2.4979,4.0188,0.9036,9.98,6.5114,5.4035,4.5126,3.8443,0.7331,5.5827,3.4792,0.883,1.1935,2.6821,4.8482,3.8191,3.5204,5.0273,3.4553,0.5207,1.2246,1.0517,4.4945,0.2615,0.9527,4.4762,1.8858,3.4119,0.6783,5.6354,0.4436,4.5914,0.3615,3.788,2.0385,3.4886,5.1876,3.0765,2.4803,4.1715,0.9667,1.9483,3.3864,3.4795,1.2094,2.1175,4.7076,1.3245,0.4871,4.2396,3.0528,0.9747,0.446,6.2388,4.1547,2.3078,0.2513,0.666,2.0252,0.0188,2.5995,4.3023,1.1789,0.0333,5.2791,1.2656,5.4023,0.7481,3.4656,2.9193,0.923,2.2749,4.0305,3.0394,0.7506,2.9449,1.9644,1.5592,3.0745,0.0035,2.0607,3.1971,2.1821,2.3646,1.5077,3.025,1.6151,1.1425,4.3489,3.9445,0.9615,3.3971,0.9514,2.4766,2.1901,2.7075,2.2728,1.1338,3.1571,1.0009,0.7826,1.634,3.0794,1.5965,0.5093,2.0352,1.5707,3.4585,2.6328,1.9797,0.3751,1.0647,0.0002,2.1993,1.0381,7.6497,1.188,4.2621,1.7922,0.5196,2.9556,3.8537,3.3075,1.9378,1.1989,1.0084,0.4535,0.9289,2.6384,1.543,4.1769,0.2645,2.0689,0.0675,2.4972,4.1091,0.3072,0.5938,2.203,3.2786,1.4343,2.9941,1.0084,0.0029,0.9215,3.374,4.771,1.987,0.3562,2.7342,0.0378,0.1081,4.1374,1.2902,0.3826,0.9347,3.4913,0.049,0.0002,0.2498,2.1558,0.0002,1.1481,0.8637,0.0047,1.8776,4.1576,2.9004,0.217,3.0049,0.4752,2.1906,2.997,4.0783,5.2263,3.234,1.405,4.2397,0.4693,5.8873,0.5401,1.0722,3.6833,4.1422,4.0827,0.9725,4.1047,5.8392,1.8752,2.5986,0.0298,0.0044,2.095,4.0199,2.1784,4.5678,0.0014,3.8034,3.0397,1.6708,4.8154,1.9711,5.5455,0.1769,1.5483,0.9154,0.0027,1.7154,4.5183,3.2258,0.4405,0.7713,4.398,5.0444,4.4922,4.158,2.1996,6.4072,3.3074,0.5086,2.3327,0.173,0.9427,6.6612,0.2962,6.1055,4.2868,0.229,1.3187,1.6989,1.0232,1.4087,4.518,1.101,2.8921,2.7139,0.3829,4.8178,0.1599,0.6665,0.6084,0.0034,0.3304,0.6861,0.0002,2.3623,3.8909,1.8271,0.1036,5.2853,5.3622,2.2661,0.9751,0.6515,5.1036,4.7303,2.2128,2.2345,4.8638,3.2101,0.6979,0.768,1.9035,5.8915,1.3635,1.1515,2.1382,4.9954,5.7397,2.3732,0.3882,2.0251,5.1732,4.2047,2.9848,1.3335,2.7675,0.0273,5.1103,2.2422,2.2672,3.6745,4.6282,2.7839,4.0692,0.285,3.8471,5.3443,0.1574,5.2777,2.9021,3.6107,2.7484,1.9199,6.3501,5.9714,5.5737,0.6756,1.4894,0.3904,6.2961,0.36,4.915,1.0555,4.8732,0.329,2.5616,1.3564,3.0855,0.8934,1.7459,2.2994,1.5588,2.4023,3.0055,1.8472,3.4109,0.2598,0.3138,5.431,0.6264,3.2778,4.398,0.7242,0.4628,0.0002,4.3769,0.3462,3.8005,0.0613,1.1344,4.691,3.0109,4.4951,2.4306,0.0001,1.2156,4.9639,1.0842,3.0327,2.5437,1.5737,0.8361,4.3848,2.0681,2.305,0.2062,0.1197,0.0536,1.7672,0.2443,0.0231,1.0493,4.4462,2.6354,0.1816,0.1534,1.0262,5.9705,0.1006,2.7144,0.6059,0.0001,2.0062,3.0377,3.4867,0.7601,4.1672,4.5721,0.7609,2.3423,3.1822,5.5113,1.1248,4.071,2.8238,2.7752,1.2243,0.5704,3.6971,1.8435,6.4804,0.8373,4.644,3.7335,2.9123,6.4253,0.316,3.4697,5.8362,2.5531,0.7062,0.8118,4.3204,0.8206,0.4993,1.9578,2.7059,2.799,1.2301,5.5068,0.5447,2.8701,1.7602,5.3582,0.2093,0.3093,0.8143,0.0002,5.0408,3.1147]}
{"id":4244,"ended":false,"length":438,"gen_text":"The station for the roller coaster is quite different than traditional stations. As the train enters, it slows down but does not stop. There is a moving sidewalk on both sides of your street and one that is closed. The walkway on the park benches has been closed because of the weather. Many people did not leave until we removed the debris. We also have a walkway that is closed but is still available for viewing after dark. There are few trees on this area and when the light is turned up your face and face will look different. We wanted to have a unique attraction but we also wanted to do some shopping. The street parking with two stores is not available. To get there you have to take the metro for 10 minutes to the park, with a bus. We did not want any one parking near the park. As a group we did not care to have cars in the area. It was extremely hard to pass by. There were many people waiting for us and some were waiting for us outside, so there was not a problem walking by us. Just have a good look around the parking lot. We have good views of the park with the light on and the street parking. You can see some of the shops that you can enjoy in the park. Our favorite part of the site is where the train crosses through the park and meets the park benches. The park is still very empty and we will probably do another \"turn around\" there. If you don't visit the park we hope you will enjoy the views at the end of the ride, even if the ride is cancelled due to delays. We hope to have this one for sale at local book fairs in 2018. If you want to get in, then you can visit our webpage for 2018 on our Facebook page. Please leave a comment with your plans and views. The park is in very busy development in South Central Los Angeles that may not be suitable for any amusement park. Please see this blog post for the latest details and a map for the ride.

{"id":1329,"ended":true,"length":426,"gen_text":"After the financially successful release of The Rise of Cobra, Rob Moore, the studio vice chairman of Paramount Pictures, stated in 2009 that a sequel would be developed. In January 2011, Warner Brothers announced that it would be developing The Rise of Cobra, an ongoing action thriller based on the award-winning comic strip. On Nov. 20, 2013, the studio announced that it would enter development on An American Beauty with Robert Downey Jr. and J.K. Simmons and that it was planning to have The Rise of The Cobra and The Rise of Cobra 2 at the same time. The studio also announced that The Rise of The Cobra 2 will have two feature films: The Rise of the Cobra 3; and The Rise of The Cobra 4. More information about The Rise of the Cobra will be announced in 2014. In 2011, Fox's Fox, which has recently emerged as the network with the most films of any major studio (behind its recent drama The X-Files ), released a new script titled \" Cobra Wars,\" with producer Steve M. Moore and the script's author Michael Schur. Fox also released three movies with Moore as director, based on a 1997 television movie and a 1992 movie starring Rolf Adams. The first of these produced two films, Cobra Crisis: Black Cat, (2004), a sequel to Cobra Crisis, followed by Cobra Wars: The War for the Sun in 2012. The rebooted movie is currently working on a sequel, The Rise of The Cobra 3: The Beginning, with further work expected to begin at Fox in 2015. A script was produced by Stephen Wren and Rob Moore that will feature an actor and director\/manager-level team based on Joe Cornish's script from the 1989 movie, and a script by John C. Reilly. The original screenplay for The Rise of The Cobra was written by Jim Cavill (also in the movies). The studio announced that they would pursue a third, James Bond: Spectre, in 2016. The film was also helmed by Kevin Costner and Ron Howard during the same year. The fourth James Bond film The Bourne Identity is currently still in development for Universal Pictures. Other productions have also been completed, including the upcoming Fox drama: The Bourne Supremacy.","token_len":450,"entropy":[2.3183,13.5947,3.1816,5.4773,0.1227,3.0711,7.1672,0.6013,1.5773,1.1335,7.6935,5.3385,3.0769,1.7554,4.5114,6.3502,3.5983,1.5813,6.1499,0.3015,0.3311,5.3149,2.5122,5.5066,0.3787,4.253,2.3334,1.6265,0.5574,4.2713,2.2008,2.9574,4.62,1.9665,0.1629,4.2379,3.4097,1.2916,0.7955,1.5087,1.0129,2.031,1.3582,2.3702,2.0937,0.0171,0.4436,2.0009,3.2487,6.0548,2.7786,2.5783,1.9368,0.0576,0.5116,5.4846,0.16,0.0063,2.963,3.1688,0.881,4.8325,6.0849,0.0533,3.3337,0.0378,2.4551,0.0607,1.8282,0.8121,0.9297,0.6175,0.9907,0.7112,5.9416,4.9049,1.094,7.0055,1.4963,4.3864,4.2231,4.1174,1.1033,0.0001,0.0126,0.6925,1.2967,4.4918,0.2706,0.7251,0.0009,0.1412,3.4872,2.1829,1.3098,2.1259,3.9643,0.5209,4.3154,3.0375,0.3576,0.0178,4.5807,0.0304,4.5308,1.6112,2.6752,0.0838,0.1601,0.8343,4.2362,0.936,0.163,0.0187,0.3423,2.1103,1.4823,2.1158,1.1374,0.5098,3.4837,0.1693,0.0167,0.8908,0.2161,0.8305,2.2494,3.3077,3.7064,4.0255,0.2257,2.716,1.3,0.5242,0.0829,1.4029,0.1914,2.1524,6.5606,0.169,0.4527,0.0706,0.0067,1.5936,0.3423,0.3607,0.2327,6.1561,1.4803,1.0137,1.4372,0.0104,0.0072,0.7533,0.0795,2.5357,0.0937,1.5039,1.2712,3.6494,0.2045,3.6229,4.1321,0.0635,3.7728,3.8046,3.0916,4.2057,1.8632,3.1368,4.9056,5.5802,0.0774,1.4037,5.712,2.9377,0.4977,1.5867,4.884,2.6031,0.5707,2.1085,0.5655,3.629,4.2104,5.2546,5.6946,5.9909,1.65,3.44,0.0371,0.1314,5.2556,2.4799,1.7214,2.5218,3.7316,1.9348,2.5293,8.0771,5.1204,4.7322,3.2935,4.876,4.4205,4.8711,2.6916,2.8307,2.1472,3.541,3.2636,1.2162,3.5058,3.756,5.5888,0.9186,1.0122,3.9534,2.3477,1.3275,4.5779,3.3918,2.4919,1.4221,2.0676,2.6865,1.5659,5.3677,0.0414,2.8219,5.7342,5.1037,1.5874,3.9631,1.2768,4.1382,1.6123,1.7919,5.3343,3.9878,5.1902,0.7325,1.5223,2.5067,2.1229,0.7316,5.7125,3.4095,2.3649,0.7508,2.8883,7.7841,2.4685,6.3144,4.6655,1.3836,5.2784,4.2499,0.8978,2.7696,2.8197,0.3018,3.0184,0.5984,1.5351,4.8138,1.4182,0.9828,2.6554,0.9244,1.5236,4.3448,2.9564,1.4094,3.9615,3.1874,3.563,0.5474,1.4093,5.5376,0.9053,2.6564,3.1444,2.7339,4.6883,0.136,0.9062,1.6907,1.7956,2.4669,1.736,0.0191,1.9532,0.1103,2.5863,1.8374,1.1584,4.9126,1.219,2.04,5.7181,3.1151,1.655,1.6112,2.0413,4.6254,1.9198,1.4118,1.5615,0.1139,3.9321,4.2464,2.7546,3.2775,0.9867,5.7642,4.9195,5.4295,1.2362,5.1883,0.7963,3.3946,2.4238,2.5948,3.2296,4.4132,2.6492,2.7402,5.2406,5.7217,5.5866,3.4225,3.422,5.0323,0.5049,5.7137,4.7323,0.0801,0.8724,2.7322,3.5175,1.3901,4.6806,1.8374,1.9475,2.6618,1.9962,1.7439,0.664,3.4703,3.6888,0.7489,1.4551,1.6606,0.9541,3.0454,2.2701,2.0901,1.2747,0.0353,0.0036,1.3493,0.0409,0.6664,0.9008,0.1483,4.3245,5.4404,3.8295,2.144,6.1029,4.2171,0.7738,5.0166,1.9843,1.1772,4.5976,4.2586,1.4565,2.2505,1.0677,4.0484,1.2209,2.6589,3.9949,5.3406,1.502,2.8195,3.287,0.6691,1.5241,1.8365,0.3794,1.4029,2.8581,1.9937,3.0903,5.613,0.0034,0.0182,4.4082,1.7444,0.0,1.5405,5.5262,0.2768,6.7553,0.6313,4.0501,0.8927,0.6371,1.3659,4.9206,3.469,0.0008,0.4971,4.8719,3.4586,0.0018,1.9543,2.2911,1.9299,5.1648,0.5432,0.4488,4.829,3.3443,1.2949,0.5593,5.8646,5.3265,3.2813,1.6472,0.3813,4.4589,1.9419,0.4363,1.8835,2.7377,5.2819,2.3826,6.2139,1.5051,3.1713,0.0004,2.1121,0.011,0.0022,1.3381]}
{"id":1186,"ended":false,"length":368,"gen_text":"There are two lanes for automobile traffic across the top of the dam, which formerly served as the Colorado River crossing for U.S. Route 93. In the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Colorado River began flowing through major portions of the park.\n\nThe dam is intended to make it easier for trucks to travel safely down the dam. It's supposed to save a lot of river water runoff from flooding and sedimentation over time due to evaporation after storms and other hazards during the summer. The project is scheduled to open in early 2011, although that's not expected until 2019. But for now, the park will remain open with two lanes for truck traffic.\n\nMore importantly, the dam will help clean up the Great Divide. If a large river floods, it can cause heavy erosion or contamination of streams. As a result, the park's water supply is in shambles.\n\nFor more information, visit: http:\/\/cityofsno.org\/jop\/gov\/gov\/jp\/sites\/jp\/content\/public-safety\/index.shtml.\n\nAbout the City of Riverside\n\nSparks City Councilman Gary Lutz said the city is looking for more than a few solutions when it comes to restoring its watershed. The City of Riverside recently created the County Conservation Committee, which will set policy, evaluate the proposed site conditions, and choose a site where appropriate. The county has established an advisory board to oversee the project, and there will be a formal meeting in January.\n\nIn the meantime, any suggestions or criticisms that might surface are welcome.

{"id":2054,"ended":false,"length":369,"gen_text":"Following the end of the Pacific War in August 1945, SWPA was dissolved and RAAF Headquarters again assumed full control of all its operational formations, including the area commands. By the end of 1940, SWPA was the largest organization of armed forces in the world and was considered among the oldest and most advanced forces on the planet.\n\nRAAF-RAF\n\nIn its early years, the RAAF was part of the NATO-backed RAAF-RAF and its command was commanded by Commander Lt. Commander George Babbitt III. RAAF RAF officers were appointed by Lt. Commander George Hodge after being elected by the rank and file of General Staff. RAAF members received various training and advanced education for their military career.\n\nBy 1945, the RAAF was an important force in the post-war world. The Allied invasion of Japan in April 1945 and the Korean War provided many opportunities for an even more significant RAAF-RAF, one capable of supporting any major war effort, and to aid in the creation and maintenance of a modern command and control structure during the second world war.\n\nRAAF-RAF was also able to provide leadership on the RAAF-ARV, a joint service of the American and Japanese Air Force. RAAF members were also highly decorated for leadership through the various service branches: The Royal Canadian (RCI) and Naval Reserve Corps, the U.S. Army, the Navy, RCAF and the Marine Corps.\n\nThe RAAF had over 1,500 combat personnel. The members of the American forces of the RCAF, Army and Navy, RCAF and MAR-47, the NRC, UMC and Canadian Forces and also the RCAF and Canadian Royal Air Force Air Force, are examples of RAAF-RAF officers.\n\nA key aspect of the RAAF-RAF is the role of its three service branches. At different levels of responsibility, RAAF officers could be included as senior officers of each service branch. As well, these officers could serve on the RAAF-RAF for a period of time, providing guidance over operations, training, command and control at different levels.\n\nBibliography","token_len":451,"entropy":[2.5081,4.9773,0.0292,0.8963,8.2965,0.5409,2.7421,3.1633,1.1539,0.1372,11.2527,5.4711,2.6124,4.0891,1.7579,7.7065,3.6778,6.7904,6.5752,4.315,4.0143,0.6456,0.3271,3.5451,5.1137,4.2786,8.3533,2.2565,1.9972,1.0531,7.7303,8.1462,0.6962,3.8319,1.5451,0.7063,0.0075,5.4882,0.3178,2.0825,0.0095,1.3314,2.9261,2.0569,4.6698,1.3111,5.0952,0.7184,0.2953,0.3726,0.45,1.8951,2.1276,3.7654,5.0337,0.0489,4.9534,1.3082,0.3287,2.144,4.2253,3.0132,0.9152,0.4576,0.151,1.1577,0.0045,4.2464,0.5355,5.0108,5.2783,0.8723,1.9385,0.0002,2.7713,4.1475,2.44,0.6858,0.3054,1.1566,0.4166,0.0024,1.4362,4.6633,0.0057,0.3332,5.394,1.9786,3.6154,2.9057,0.8547,0.9158,0.0506,0.0035,3.6125,3.2557,4.8187,1.5483,4.7219,0.0808,4.7391,3.657,0.5226,3.1899,4.9641,3.7784,6.1516,0.2231,6.8616,0.5668,2.7309,0.0052,10.0913,5.9917,1.2057,4.2303,1.3882,4.614,0.0089,0.6478,1.9595,3.7286,4.9414,4.9831,3.3603,2.5036,1.6095,0.5372,4.1371,0.5951,0.0012,1.0521,4.769,2.3581,1.4972,2.2553,0.0032,4.1084,3.8679,5.1547,2.5454,1.0881,5.1377,5.5577,4.4962,1.1163,2.886,2.5509,0.6419,1.3654,0.0002,4.1338,2.3142,0.1427,1.0963,0.3829,0.0015,0.9776,4.3412,1.9427,2.0003,0.6154,0.5617,5.293,0.2825,0.5853,1.259,1.3122,2.0588,5.3734,2.8441,0.1646,1.4081,1.3652,2.564,0.1931,2.9406,0.5192,4.2649,0.1572,4.1983,5.357,0.9989,0.1499,4.9716,5.5925,1.2052,3.3073,2.3052,0.0036,1.6575,0.0493,0.002,3.5068,4.4292,4.5462,0.0219,3.3745,4.6611,3.6156,3.1088,0.3498,2.9384,2.5657,4.3949,5.5444,1.3708,1.095,3.8578,2.4536,1.3177,0.0137,1.5417,3.5711,5.4699,1.8398,0.1712,0.5862,6.7013,0.6845,4.4319,1.3153,0.0015,0.096,0.7924,0.0002,2.0563,0.0274,0.8811,0.1437,0.0066,2.9075,2.9953,4.7526,0.0045,2.4201,3.3807,3.5339,1.3909,3.8312,0.0655,0.9042,6.4806,3.8219,2.2071,2.0037,3.0489,4.9263,1.1759,1.0345,4.9725,1.1117,2.2375,2.9184,0.3778,0.8232,2.2866,0.0061,3.874,1.1331,2.3008,4.9085,4.6282,1.8199,6.3585,6.4072,1.7452,5.3743,3.8557,1.9787,5.3875,4.6489,3.6327,2.7729,7.46,2.4358,5.712,0.9092,1.424,6.2904,2.0398,3.8782,1.6594,0.6522,4.5095,0.019,0.019,0.0315,0.8054,1.8111,0.8545,2.6124,0.4796,6.3111,0.5298,0.018,1.7919,1.0573,2.6593,0.0123,0.2553,0.6208,0.0002,2.0416,0.7582,0.0323,4.1988,5.1109,2.9215,0.1058,1.8283,3.3168,2.8405,2.7093,1.8469,5.9861,0.6361,0.3806,6.9334,5.8202,3.886,0.6688,2.4639,0.3391,0.0036,2.0575,4.357,0.9072,1.2984,1.9796,4.2419,0.0867,0.0227,2.0596,5.8754,3.2264,5.3492,1.5784,3.7181,5.8039,4.4838,1.5876,4.2749,5.1701,0.9409,4.9355,1.3137,3.2646,4.5004,1.2517,1.9899,0.3959,0.082,2.4501,3.2343,4.1893,2.2384,0.084,4.9148,1.1052,1.6518,3.5747,5.5367,0.0776,2.3115,0.0839,0.5972,0.0489,0.0034,3.1838,1.4858,0.6197,0.0002,4.1909,5.4583,2.6404,0.0847,0.5799,0.4427,0.0224,0.3243,0.0153,0.0011,2.9253,1.3555,3.8921,1.2503,1.9682,5.7783,5.0601,0.2837,1.4875,5.4958,5.7049,1.0801,0.8614,5.1286,0.5004,2.3597,0.1481,1.6965,4.6526,1.6309,5.2474,2.224,3.6686,1.0221,2.0348,4.051,2.5126,0.1883,0.9316,3.8972,3.3724,1.3153,4.5313,0.8376,1.0083,2.2259,2.33,0.9719,1.5119,0.1563,0.6006,0.2135,0.0019,3.5593,1.8792,1.5347,0.1164,1.0298,1.6121,3.9442,4.2095,6.0219,3.8404,1.6135,2.0509,1.1546,4.4724,0.4424,0.0948,5.6372,2.3411,0.3345,1.3667,0.5811,0.0002,5.7242,1.6773]}

{"id":4000,"ended":false,"length":436,"gen_text":"After seeing how well the first film was made, the cast and crew signed for two sequels to be shot back @ - @ to @ - @ back, a practical decision on your part since the script only came out in early 2017, only to be sent to Marvel because of delays with Marvel's second season. I knew we were in for a lot in the script, as I hadn't seen any films with those two main characters. Unfortunately, I was pretty certain I had to cut my movie.\nIt was a very good experience for me! I was hoping to give my cast and crew the chance to reprise roles we would play with the other Star Trek characters. To this day, I am very impressed with how it has worked out! If you follow me on Twitter, you'll find that my tweets are often filled with \"Hello, I can't be the same with you\". One of my tweets is an account where I give my thoughts on some of my favourite books, what will they be, and what I read.\nBefore the script was released on April 14th of 2017, Marvel posted a post on their Facebook page asking fans about the script and if it was for real! Not a lot of coverage from Marvel, so I thought it was worth having an opportunity to see where they were going with this.\nIt has been 5 weeks since the first film was released so hopefully we will see the latest material and be able to make the film this summer. This is something that I would personally take for granted, and perhaps even do a little more research as they had to adjust the plot a bit to avoid this one episode.\nIt is my understanding that when the first cast member comes back, they will have to play a different character from what they were in the original film, but with time at my disposal, I believe they have the right to play that character as they see fit. So, in any case, we may see different casting choices that will fit different cast members. Personally I would love it if the cast members could re-recruit people back, so that's my best hope for the next Star Trek movie.

On Nov. 20, 1950, the Rivers Of America series was finally published and the show quickly became part of the National Geographic community. [ 5 ] During the early 1950s Douglas also co-founded the first-ever International Film Awards Festival where she appeared on-screen for a handful of categories such as \"best documentary,\" \"best documentary feature film\", \"most famous documentary,\" and \"most recently on TV for the final season of the NBC sitcom 'Dirty Money.' [ 6 ] In addition to the many awards she receives, she has also received a Nobel Prize in literature for her work with the American History Association, a Pulitzer Prizes for research, and a MacArthur Grant for \"making it possible to make an impact.\" [ 7 ] Other awards she has received include several grants totaling $50,000 and $4,000 for her work in English and literature, and for her work on a film, The Dancer.

She contested the German Rally Championship and two WRC events in a Peugeot 205 Turbo 16, but never won one in its inaugural year since she qualified on the final day of the season because of serious injury. After racing on top of a Peugeot, she broke off several of the German Rally Championships and entered the FIA Formula E season with her team. This season her team qualified for its maiden season in Australia.\n\nIn 1986 Carlin made her first start at the European Road Championships, but was denied four podium titles, the first one by Carlin. Following the crash of her Mercedes Carrera 3 RS on the final day of the final season, the team was unable to qualify for Australia. She followed that victory by racing on the final day of the Toyota Cup while holding the German Rally Championship in 1991.\n\nA former member of the Porsche Steambuilding division, Carlin won the Porsche World Championship with Porsche, and returned to work at Porsche's headquarters after a stint as a customer of the Porsche factory. She retired from NASCAR 2.0 in 1997, but managed to get on track for the third consecutive season, winning the 2015 season.\n\nIn 2004, Carlin made her debut in the 2014 Car Championship against the eventual champion, Megan Hurd, but never competed at the World Championship again.\n\nCarlin is survived by her kids, Nick, and Jad.\n\nFuneral arrangements\n\nCarlin's two sons, Jonathan and Nathan, as well as James, died Sunday from injury. Her husband and two daughters-in-law died in their beds on Dec. 19 after collapsing, and Carol was left in a wheelchair.\n\nCarlin is survived by her husband, James Carlin, a neighbor of her at the time, and his partner, Mark Hurd, and her two boys, Anthony and Scott. Her husband is her husband's best friend, Matt Hurd; she recently divorced Mark Hurd and filed for divorce with Matt Hurd last November.\n\nHer husband will be sorely missed by her grandchildren; they will be dearly missed by her grandchildren.\n\nShare this story:","token_len":457,"entropy":[7.8257,2.5344,11.1961,3.8507,4.5058,5.2659,1.1575,8.8176,1.6805,4.285,7.5032,3.5972,2.9686,7.5901,0.1053,0.0018,4.6124,1.3778,6.8701,0.6981,0.533,2.2362,10.4814,1.4331,5.1282,7.33,0.767,2.6829,5.9689,5.3011,1.029,4.2142,1.6177,4.18,11.3131,0.0,0.003,8.9411,8.1414,9.3582,2.5798,1.9763,4.1302,2.0056,3.0055,2.8412,5.1198,4.3592,2.9643,6.3097,4.4216,5.3106,3.959,0.7847,2.795,0.92,0.5269,0.3894,1.1074,7.6222,0.6626,6.0845,2.1969,0.2974,4.0699,4.3448,3.3915,5.8394,0.509,1.7158,3.8802,0.0001,0.0033,3.8475,0.715,5.3626,1.8995,6.7773,2.2485,1.9982,4.6494,0.5314,2.8346,1.4962,5.0874,0.6094,3.5309,2.3941,1.5386,3.1736,1.3769,3.2273,3.1482,1.8581,4.9497,2.1249,4.6689,1.2619,3.818,0.9416,4.6269,4.1453,1.259,1.7805,5.4103,1.5616,1.2392,0.0046,2.4237,2.4461,4.5549,1.4688,4.3268,0.8155,1.9517,3.7139,1.9218,1.0229,4.5857,5.3592,2.7314,1.4912,2.1396,1.9133,4.5969,6.2421,2.8889,5.7357,2.8801,3.458,1.0501,4.6339,2.0279,3.2864,0.0037,1.0806,4.9469,1.3007,3.6239,2.9168,0.9519,3.8438,5.7684,0.3149,4.5941,5.7189,3.6771,0.8089,1.4979,0.509,0.1953,0.1758,5.2732,1.9429,0.9598,3.0793,1.8123,2.1001,3.4634,0.0052,1.5386,0.3206,3.1881,1.3261,2.8482,5.6567,1.1381,6.0752,2.3226,2.2856,1.6649,1.1609,2.1708,0.105,0.1233,0.1449,6.594,3.2352,6.0547,5.1476,1.7092,4.1498,1.003,0.091,3.4899,4.6216,0.4233,1.3549,0.0001,4.3522,4.8092,3.7891,0.0042,0.5774,3.1921,5.429,5.3941,2.3665,6.0378,0.5047,0.2573,0.0016,2.9329,1.3369,1.8535,2.1061,1.327,3.2116,1.9972,3.2737,2.5079,5.1012,0.1826,4.3616,2.1955,1.2633,3.2052,3.392,4.2086,2.9567,2.2737,1.7176,0.9911,5.5596,4.7765,1.3641,1.7944,2.648,0.9669,1.4102,3.6222,0.8886,6.5067,7.4207,0.9089,0.2277,0.8146,2.7046,1.3434,1.8839,4.9083,0.1482,3.5364,3.4226,1.9943,1.5755,0.6619,5.3696,2.7637,0.6187,2.1132,1.3583,1.0515,5.5305,3.9483,2.1579,1.0651,0.0002,2.088,3.5039,1.5627,0.279,0.0026,3.4152,0.2816,2.101,1.5218,0.5228,5.2825,5.6448,5.4442,5.5748,2.398,5.3425,0.9529,2.3319,5.5511,2.7062,4.5554,1.0512,1.9698,4.0247,4.1543,2.8212,0.3501,3.1722,1.1767,2.9809,0.2745,1.8437,0.0002,1.3213,0.01,2.9463,1.1418,0.003,0.258,6.6184,0.7631,5.3584,1.9205,5.0022,5.406,4.1021,2.4242,0.9583,0.0002,5.187,0.9513,0.676,2.0741,0.0002,1.0977,0.0228,1.0458,5.0747,1.3751,0.5681,5.1877,0.4621,5.1525,0.1919,6.139,0.02,0.0021,6.4187,0.8842,2.6557,5.6434,3.0857,5.673,0.7191,2.7434,1.7111,3.0452,2.5517,2.0087,4.4862,0.0172,0.001,0.0012,4.2884,1.5505,2.787,3.6216,2.4362,5.071,0.0381,3.3235,3.6672,4.405,4.5327,2.0209,6.2537,2.0881,2.5747,2.2527,1.182,2.8643,1.195,0.7629,0.0002,0.853,0.022,3.2152,0.1036,0.008,0.2774,1.0812,0.8364,3.1777,1.6447,0.0111,0.3385,3.2157,6.2383,1.7698,1.3536,4.5397,0.8279,0.1451,0.8919,1.0534,2.0793,4.9512,0.5117,4.5813,4.1087,0.5684,0.6981,2.1106,2.1093,2.485,5.4944,0.6728,5.346,0.6252,5.1651,0.5226,2.9982,1.9292,2.8245,4.2491,2.2309,0.2633,3.7021,0.0477,1.4159,5.5604,1.5511,0.0244,3.8746,4.1661,4.5104,3.1899,3.4132,0.3068,0.0006,1.9446,4.877,0.0509,0.1425,3.2083,3.4351,0.5672,0.0007,5.1584,2.8597,0.2183,0.5242,0.0002,2.7523,2.2076,4.5303,0.8286,4.1239,0.006,0.9315,0.8459,4.1862,4.9703,2.3227,0.8284,0.7606,4.4924,0.0118,0.3622,0.7843,3.0289,1.0392,0.5096,0.0002,5.0569,0.5909,2.082,0.7211]}

Leno's new gig would be to deliver the novel to his audience in June and November 1903, followed by an airing in the West End.\n\nLeno's new contract, which required him to provide an agent for distribution and distribution during times of wartime wartime and its subsequent continuation during wartime, was later revealed on the BBC's TV series The Black Lion and the Dying Light, and his appearance was mentioned as the first public appearance of the novel in the run of the show.\n\nAlthough he never came out for any major commercial work during his life, such as performing at a festival for the Royal Shakespeare Company in Paris in 1908, Leno was extremely active in his school and in his work with the public (including appearing for the Shakespeare Prize in 1913, and later for the Oscar-winning dramatist Walter Moore in 1925), and the public's fascination with the book led him to publish three subsequent novelizations: The Prince's Road in London, in which he played a servant and later on a young man with a love of the opera and a desire to learn how to play a loonie, and In the Dark in Berlin: The Adventures of Captain Joseph Heller (1927) which revealed the mysterious character of L\u00e9on de Zephen, and The King of the Lost Books trilogy where the book is called The Prince's Road, following that two series that had never been published. While these books were published during the late-19th-early-20th century (and as early as 1933), as the BBC would later claim, Leno and their publisher had nothing to do with them at the time; they simply were in the process of completing a book that didn't even exist (as part of the production company L\u00e9on de Zephen for the British press).\n\nIn the early 2000s, Leno's publisher and he co-creator was Peter Jackson, who had spent a number of years living in the USA and, coincidentally, writing for an American-based newspaper, The Globe.\n\nSources [ edit ]","token_len":461,"entropy":[11.9068,2.6816,1.4413,7.2006,1.6842,2.4162,7.2653,3.5237,4.0788,9.9566,0.1936,1.9331,7.0468,7.0024,6.7527,12.2303,3.5361,3.2673,8.3483,2.8773,0.0253,2.0643,2.0383,1.49,6.0499,7.3396,2.028,1.5524,1.4007,9.1308,3.4812,6.452,8.28,0.7671,0.0433,2.6945,7.2973,1.5086,5.437,0.8506,3.2445,2.5727,0.2364,3.1252,0.0007,1.6053,5.734,6.0765,2.1171,0.8373,2.054,5.3839,1.1223,6.1163,1.1466,2.7868,3.6935,2.108,4.8336,3.3749,4.1768,1.3869,1.0294,4.4919,0.1804,2.7849,5.6092,1.9195,1.1829,5.5193,0.9892,2.1098,1.1342,0.0057,4.2797,0.0479,1.1824,4.2277,5.0524,3.0488,1.9775,3.9876,0.4675,0.0279,4.2694,3.1604,4.163,1.6169,5.4815,2.626,2.9149,5.3434,7.0002,0.2714,5.1383,5.2764,4.2672,5.9609,4.6191,5.7314,3.8371,1.6131,0.1631,1.1264,4.3568,5.9263,5.1823,1.9072,4.5366,0.9829,5.4895,2.0062,1.7731,5.1779,5.3019,2.3411,1.1997,5.2723,3.4527,1.8176,2.7695,3.4659,5.1715,2.6544,4.4487,2.4059,2.2122,2.6632,4.8155,1.5519,0.506,1.4452,2.1281,1.2659,1.4229,5.2537,1.4003,1.0423,2.5464,0.6532,0.9128,0.0002,4.8748,2.209,3.4387,5.2614,2.1415,4.0429,4.1592,4.4732,4.7925,2.1233,2.6688,0.8726,2.7965,0.1478,6.1717,0.0852,5.3256,2.9041,2.3158,5.2428,2.1335,1.2461,3.8416,1.8424,0.1624,1.0812,4.5471,0.8679,4.0082,0.2684,1.0817,0.0003,1.6294,5.6225,2.747,0.3519,2.234,5.638,2.0941,2.9198,1.5368,4.0027,2.8788,1.3092,4.4942,4.9201,2.2261,5.8526,3.4955,1.2409,4.8722,4.2599,1.529,3.4876,2.0951,2.5224,3.6899,1.1062,0.9789,5.2669,1.7752,0.3678,5.1837,0.1085,0.8509,4.5749,6.01,1.1281,3.3952,2.5471,1.2077,3.9017,3.258,2.9142,2.9677,0.1194,1.8037,3.8538,1.7691,0.7373,0.0818,4.2829,5.0356,5.4775,4.6499,1.1031,2.5944,1.1932,6.0409,2.6338,5.6949,3.4327,4.0071,1.2195,4.1799,2.2838,0.1838,2.688,1.3178,5.3371,2.5352,3.6047,4.4008,3.0266,3.8248,2.463,4.0008,1.2559,4.9272,1.2325,2.6577,4.5483,2.8642,2.1867,2.6253,0.2091,3.9635,2.4861,0.3506,1.2364,2.2469,5.6558,7.2997,0.9408,0.984,0.5091,3.2241,1.077,3.717,3.0791,5.5046,5.9031,1.4938,4.3975,0.0273,5.4319,5.694,5.3495,2.1159,0.3999,2.9825,2.0859,1.5889,5.5759,1.7936,5.3012,2.7191,0.8207,4.6303,4.8502,0.3773,4.6609,5.6714,5.2775,3.7515,2.0491,3.4966,1.5309,4.7832,1.6749,1.3193,4.6635,5.0192,5.6576,5.1156,3.2557,3.7096,2.5368,4.3075,1.636,3.3832,0.4868,0.5005,2.3583,5.6654,5.1267,6.2388,4.8132,3.4041,2.6614,4.1342,0.6004,0.6707,1.2462,5.9557,3.971,1.8414,1.0163,1.9503,3.9635,0.7996,3.2178,4.2645,0.6532,1.359,3.3485,1.0505,0.2378,0.1742,0.0033,0.7117,3.2694,3.0805,4.3921,2.3853,0.0304,4.2807,0.3745,4.7256,2.196,5.8562,5.6332,0.9214,3.1431,0.7531,1.5458,0.0015,3.8152,5.8674,2.4452,3.426,4.9974,0.2722,0.0948,0.012,1.0966,3.3648,1.566,0.0139,3.5003,1.9297,3.1358,3.5743,5.2515,1.1997,2.5536,0.0316,4.659,1.6686,2.7105,2.5464,6.3263,0.0008,3.2928,0.9921,3.9979,3.4146,4.9049,0.0022,1.3064,4.7845,2.7169,6.1141,1.9636,0.0369,0.5055,0.0185,0.0013,0.0031,5.5053,1.5287,3.7469,4.4998,1.248,0.4046,0.0002,2.1112,2.028,2.2099,5.4462,0.0614,0.2553,1.434,0.0014,1.9597,3.7648,3.769,5.4743,2.8199,0.0207,3.7041,5.8699,3.9565,5.0199,0.5214,0.9704,1.5711,5.4568,2.3949,2.3718,0.0003,0.1065,6.0739,0.4721,2.3548,4.2746,1.6719,5.0177,5.0842,0.0239,0.0793,3.8781,1.6917,4.3697,1.8694,4.8068,0.7579,2.2224,1.2302,1.0421,4.5212,2.2669,2.8024,0.0002,4.5573,2.2799,0.005,0.0026]}
{"id":99,"ended":false,"length":416,"gen_text":"During his first season in the NBA, Jordan averaged 28 @. @ 2 ppg on 51 @. @ 5 % shooting. He quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas, where he has become a fixture.\n\nHe also put together an excellent season for his club in 2015-16, averaging 13 points and 15 rebounds in 21-17 win over Charlotte.\n\nJordan also contributed on an offense that was much more aggressive due to his athleticism. During his four seasons at the team he made a total of 23 free throws and shot 38% from the field, while taking 43 offensive boards.\n\nFor his rookie year he led the league in field goal percentage with a 40.6 percent success rate on threes\/rebounding, with a 4.1 rebounds per game level going back to last season.\n\nWith more ball movement and a deeper understanding of the pick-and-roll, an easy shot can give him an advantage against teams who are less aggressive than they were last season, and an offensive presence can also help him get a clean look on some of the key three point shooters in the Jazz offense.\n\nIt also helps that when Jordan was playing for the Spurs he was a 3 point shooter.\n\nJordan averages 3.4 boards per attempt on 47 percent shooting from deep through the first 10 games of his career playing under James Harden, and now he's averaging 3.8 boards per attempt on 51 percent shooting from 3 and 41 percent from the field. He's the same at 30 percent in both categories.\n\nWhile it's unlikely James Harden can match up against Jordan, it's a different story due to his overall skill set compared to his rookie season. His shooting is only a part of the equation, but he still managed to score 38 points in his first four games while shooting 42.6 percent from long range on 48 percent shooting from three.\n\nThat may not sound like a lot for a rookie, but those numbers don't just reflect his NBA game. Jordan is still young and playing at his best with the Warriors, so his game is still good for a rookie.\n\nIn any event, Jordan is not likely to take an extended break before the season even begins.\n\n(h\/t: The Athletic)","token_len":462,"entropy":[5.051,3.1607,2.5167,1.2598,1.6561,2.4518,0.1784,5.3478,1.6855,4.3369,18.1758,4.918,12.6064,8.386,3.1422,0.0904,4.2199,4.2617,8.0588,1.6592,4.2346,4.5539,7.9319,3.975,0.9385,1.9195,7.254,1.5711,1.0409,5.3987,0.0606,6.3445,2.611,7.7247,2.5723,1.4815,3.5236,0.4331,4.4293,3.8353,0.9568,3.4509,1.8065,1.8702,0.0012,3.356,2.6442,5.7045,2.3471,2.167,2.6653,2.3162,2.1029,2.9781,4.9085,1.7468,2.9419,0.2146,0.0278,0.6319,0.9518,3.8149,2.7362,1.802,4.1135,0.2994,1.2252,3.69,5.0477,3.2331,2.2032,0.2886,3.1723,0.3744,1.342,0.0002,1.938,2.8205,4.904,3.0149,4.1551,4.3321,0.3784,2.0471,4.1824,1.5382,3.6466,5.9824,0.0132,0.9168,3.9987,1.3679,4.5359,0.6591,4.7546,0.9461,3.0154,1.3787,4.2561,3.0996,5.2036,3.2081,1.0504,0.0079,4.1117,3.3537,0.1854,1.6055,3.7996,3.571,1.791,0.1363,0.2265,0.2334,1.5172,3.6958,4.7518,5.0255,5.6882,1.4765,0.8192,0.6032,0.0002,5.1714,1.2771,4.8072,1.761,2.0798,3.4084,0.2791,2.2712,0.2851,3.4425,0.2585,0.2334,2.4851,2.0695,5.2396,0.4593,2.2665,2.856,3.1993,0.0072,3.3122,2.7384,0.0002,5.7785,3.6259,0.0165,1.9516,1.6055,3.6432,1.9787,5.0866,0.1124,2.7382,5.4247,1.8032,0.2753,6.4567,6.661,1.85,0.1189,3.1929,0.3308,0.25,0.4646,0.0002,3.752,5.0314,5.0543,0.789,1.4286,2.558,4.624,1.6647,0.0459,0.8213,5.8658,1.0338,0.0006,0.0004,0.006,0.4714,6.4538,5.3529,3.0926,4.1673,5.3228,2.0347,2.0272,1.4518,3.077,4.5407,2.1344,1.6341,3.1848,2.807,3.3118,2.1643,1.4838,1.6419,0.324,2.5409,1.9651,4.3354,3.1858,4.7982,1.9318,3.2326,1.3993,1.2221,3.0448,2.8887,5.3801,0.4824,2.1757,6.8559,0.6802,0.5251,5.6766,3.8843,1.3001,0.776,2.6252,0.2052,7.3862,2.1482,0.0755,0.195,0.0002,4.2131,3.5944,1.1607,1.0081,4.7909,1.8694,1.9124,2.9631,2.1315,0.6086,4.3237,2.0488,1.1491,2.2109,4.8998,1.184,0.425,1.8598,1.9535,0.0001,2.1603,5.6163,3.2522,0.1939,2.2278,3.7292,0.3998,6.1451,2.1006,3.7536,3.0849,0.5349,0.9026,2.6483,6.8067,1.0799,0.7292,3.9677,0.0472,0.2927,1.5316,0.8928,7.8779,4.0952,3.8685,0.4955,1.666,1.6156,5.8085,1.4825,1.5734,1.1271,1.7312,0.023,2.5567,0.5335,0.2733,0.5271,0.6945,3.4628,0.3427,0.1728,0.3502,4.8271,3.2181,3.9308,0.1219,0.8826,1.1992,0.5961,0.5093,3.0283,0.8715,4.2516,3.6625,4.6532,4.4026,1.6544,4.0198,3.6279,1.2965,0.8462,0.119,0.0001,3.4624,2.908,0.7731,4.3627,5.3918,1.0716,3.6245,3.6339,2.4491,1.9825,0.5654,1.6245,1.9119,0.5724,2.6065,5.4598,0.7267,6.4741,0.0296,1.1145,4.7352,4.0183,0.4572,5.2803,0.0265,1.3164,2.6112,0.9432,0.2835,4.3369,2.9191,2.2698,4.5915,2.5215,3.0127,0.0407,1.1891,0.8082,0.8518,0.8237,1.4646,2.5118,3.6936,0.09,3.0213,5.0391,0.3604,1.3651,1.6627,0.8621,3.0923,0.4415,4.1763,1.4085,3.4577,1.0471,2.2392,0.3099,0.4858,3.9795,0.3237,3.6717,3.4474,0.5667,0.4771,0.5371,1.5252,0.5473,0.24,0.0001,3.8552,4.6902,0.9601,1.463,0.2401,2.053,0.5173,3.4379,0.6505,1.5902,0.984,0.1048,5.5852,0.6709,3.1852,0.0003,4.902,2.1631,1.0675,3.9182,3.2828,0.8251,3.1763,1.713,2.6815,4.2864,1.0627,5.0534,1.7562,3.143,0.8988,2.7546,1.5121,4.5846,1.091,2.3504,2.1006,3.0848,1.3053,1.0976,5.699,2.788,1.564,1.0137,1.0006,0.3452,0.0002,3.5557,4.5706,1.4081,0.115,2.0574,1.2363,3.644,4.0407,0.1666,4.0994,3.6871,3.5396,1.2277,3.8993,1.2956,1.3183,3.2546,0.9005,0.674,1.3925,0.0002,5.2409,3.4301,0.0013,0.0042,1.5308,2.9404,4.7698,0.1572]}

{"id":1337,"ended":true,"length":416,"gen_text":"The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 28 % approval rating with an average rating of 4 @. @ 5 \/ 10 based on 161 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"Bought one that went for $39 \/ $69 (it's about $23 more than other reviewers).\" Rotten Tomatoes also added:\n\nWhile the reviews in the review aggregator may be somewhat positive, they have many negative elements that make them less of a ratings engine. For example, the report notes that the reviewer on the site, \"Keen to get that juicy-but-not-as-huge-of-a-review-getment?\" was more than happy to review it; he never came across a reviewer who was less than a 5\/11. The review aggregator may have made some mistakes on the part of the reviewer, but that's the gist of it. One person with little experience in reviews, who didn't really know what she was talking about, can be surprised with the way there are so few reviews about the same food item on the website.\n\nAt Rotten Tomatoes, we've seen reviews in this format include \"totally awesome,\" \"gonna try it, like last time\" and \"I thought your reviewer was very good but I didn't want to spend even $15 on it.\" The reviews will usually be posted with the title \"Superfood is great,\" \"you really just need to try it, and I'll always buy those reviews,\" \"you need to try it in your place, even at $10-$15.\" That's a lot of stuff, and one reviewer will only be about seven pages long.\n\nIt is not necessary to have a review aggregator go through 10,000 submissions a day. It's also certainly not necessary to be able to verify a review in the first place.\n\nRotten Tomatoes is the publisher of Rotten Tomatoes. We review reviews of products on Rotten Tomatoes.com.

{"id":4680,"ended":true,"length":397,"gen_text":"Option C is a concept in which the current X Division Champion may voluntarily vacate the championship in exchange for a TNA World Heavyweight Championship match at that year's Destination X event. It has never been known that this would be taken advantage of, though the promoters seem to have agreed.\n\nCategories for TNA World Heavyweight Championship\n\nThe main topic of discussion at this year's Destination X event is the 'X Division Champion.' According to some sources, this event could be the most exciting ever for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nHere is the scenario for what is currently scheduled for this year's fight :\n\nRound 6 (C: Ryan Haller \/ Josh Kravitz) Round 9 (R\/B: Brian Leung) Round 10 (C: Kevin Johnson \/ Chad LeBrun) Round 11 (C: Matt Leeside) Round 12 (R: Justin Rios) Round 13 (C: Brandon Johnson) Round 14 (R: Jason Smith) Round 15 (C: Matt Leeside) Round 16 (R: Anthony Smith) Round 17 (C: Jayron Morris) Round 18 (R: Tony Dominguez) Round 19 (Chad Leeside) Round 20 (R: Joe Moraes) Round 21 (R: Anthony Smith)\n\nThis year, this event also will see a new TNA World Heavyweight Championship fight between Haller and Rios.\n\nThere are no official rules regarding the events at this year's event, aside from two main sources. If that isn't clear, it is probably that TNA World Heavyweight Championship's will only be a place that shows off the very top contenders from the roster, then TNA World Heavyweight Championship will continue to show their finest in this promotion.\n\nAs the TNA World Heavyweight Championship is a very similar promotion to that of Superstars, this year's TNA World Heavyweight Championship fight will see one of the best fighters from the roster step up. The only difference is that this one fight will only show Ryan Haller, Justin Rios, Matt Leeside, AJ Styles, and Anthony Smith fighting for the TNA World Heavyweight championship.\n\nYou can follow @TNAWWE on Instagram.","token_len":463,"entropy":[7.6981,5.5521,2.5498,7.403,2.1893,2.1785,1.8593,5.7137,8.4957,9.3276,7.6276,4.338,8.5134,7.4838,0.0008,1.8268,5.032,3.3984,3.0834,0.0082,1.069,7.7189,5.0594,3.9448,2.2227,0.0012,1.0918,4.7153,4.0351,4.7131,4.1244,0.0034,8.4778,3.9666,2.4376,0.4966,3.6926,3.3645,3.9111,0.1627,4.5,3.0422,2.0561,1.8646,1.4776,5.5744,2.3179,0.0139,1.7424,2.8048,2.64,5.7739,3.9842,0.2755,0.9382,5.6925,1.5695,0.6247,0.0003,3.9256,4.4667,3.4433,3.3027,0.049,0.6283,0.0467,0.0696,0.519,2.3517,0.0002,2.4311,3.4051,3.8963,0.6981,0.4077,2.3406,1.8266,0.5925,0.0009,0.354,0.0504,0.4993,0.8372,1.3427,5.6549,4.9729,0.49,1.0874,3.539,4.4371,0.0013,4.8992,1.704,0.222,1.5469,3.8658,3.7737,0.9923,2.7164,2.9117,3.4909,4.3813,2.0542,1.199,3.0621,0.0085,0.8423,0.0109,0.0047,0.2798,0.9964,1.2418,0.0002,5.3521,1.6164,1.5618,5.8376,1.7881,4.2535,3.1611,2.6189,2.836,1.0752,2.6565,0.2117,0.2167,7.1077,7.2505,0.171,0.0001,5.0144,5.6719,2.7945,3.8154,4.2754,5.2883,4.5162,3.3916,5.0091,5.3289,4.9586,3.4792,0.1888,0.6244,4.6639,3.8795,0.1439,4.0474,4.4923,3.2604,1.7005,4.9772,4.6913,2.3173,0.8682,0.5159,0.5045,0.026,1.0012,0.0241,4.6166,4.4776,2.963,5.2206,4.5285,3.8451,0.6917,0.14,0.3207,0.3448,0.0106,0.9394,0.0036,4.1898,3.8816,4.8646,5.4695,0.2841,0.5016,0.0682,0.0112,0.8077,2.453,4.6166,4.7972,3.2072,0.203,0.6383,0.066,0.0055,0.3435,0.0021,5.1011,4.3333,0.1939,0.4328,0.0195,0.0064,0.4974,0.0216,4.7472,4.8018,0.0697,0.3221,0.0229,0.0107,0.4666,0.0016,3.821,0.5707,0.1929,0.016,0.0228,0.3778,0.023,0.0128,0.2024,0.0054,5.1163,5.7149,0.0607,0.2747,0.0089,0.005,0.2571,0.0012,5.6065,5.6394,4.916,0.1179,0.2635,0.0066,0.0041,0.5192,0.0043,5.0112,4.9277,2.3459,0.1755,0.0385,0.2526,0.0088,0.0035,9.335,0.1501,0.212,0.2057,0.0057,0.0481,0.2631,0.0033,0.0103,0.8058,0.0054,4.8037,5.792,1.3726,1.0647,0.0433,0.2828,0.0273,0.0055,1.0462,0.0043,3.6536,1.2639,0.0217,1.893,0.0003,2.7665,3.4032,2.5176,3.018,2.0989,5.7129,3.5409,2.7372,2.2551,3.0956,2.3983,0.0083,0.191,0.0604,0.0009,1.3555,3.1003,1.1501,5.6491,0.0425,0.2979,4.0681,0.0119,0.7731,1.5931,0.0002,4.0367,1.1228,2.7464,2.1201,3.3895,1.6602,1.4986,4.7568,1.8704,0.7857,0.2361,0.0005,1.9892,0.4952,6.157,0.0424,5.8363,4.5902,4.7825,2.1808,4.5291,4.238,4.7777,0.0003,3.3509,0.3937,2.1144,1.6529,3.3299,3.9293,2.954,0.0012,0.8232,0.0291,0.006,0.3245,4.6945,3.6255,4.6337,0.7214,3.5832,5.0341,3.5084,5.6764,3.1772,1.6613,5.6759,2.4771,3.8989,2.3057,0.8494,5.4755,2.3588,5.8856,3.5952,0.0012,0.135,0.0167,0.0011,0.2385,1.3083,5.2498,0.4254,2.512,4.0879,4.6976,2.9112,2.8592,4.9664,0.4419,0.369,0.0002,3.8516,3.948,2.97,0.0095,0.102,0.0122,0.0041,0.1038,1.9776,2.3015,3.3131,5.3632,0.8893,0.3583,3.6838,0.1988,5.1625,2.144,1.2877,2.5955,2.0601,0.5855,3.3473,0.0018,0.0216,0.0211,0.001,0.0914,4.0608,1.2596,3.2747,3.9809,0.5539,0.3774,2.0429,2.4457,1.5348,1.0725,2.6893,5.5047,0.8496,2.626,3.272,3.4291,1.6307,0.9743,0.2775,2.527,4.0398,3.6959,0.6865,3.7575,3.5509,5.1517,0.0215,0.0018,1.7798,4.0371,0.1134,0.0007,0.6665,3.6556,0.0231,0.0039,0.0044,0.4021,5.7224,1.0866,0.4176,0.9008,1.7069,0.1041,3.6937,2.1048,0.6212,1.4138,0.0104,0.0371,0.0234,0.0019,4.2075,0.2589,0.4284,0.0002,5.0494,0.313,2.6486,3.3607,2.3127,0.0529,2.1443,1.4893,0.6606,4.7465,3.2787]}

These approaches allow additional discussion of treatment options and provide opportunities to arrive at well @ - recommended treatments.\n\nA study published in 2010 showed that cancer patients who underwent a chemoprevention with Ritalin did significantly better across the three follow-up periods in their ability to tolerate daily chemotherapy treatment compared with controls.\n\n\"With this treatment, [people] are not required to have any chemotherapy treatment for a disease they already have,\" said Dr. Stephen Rifkin, MD, a leader in patient-focused cancer prevention and treatment. \"This has been a difficult thing to achieve because it allows patients to know they are getting good treatment, but it's not perfect. It's not an easy prescription.\"\n\nWhen asked what treatments people can choose to tolerate in the upcoming month, Dr. Rifkin said that they can choose from Ritalin or other anti-inflammatory drugs, which could include, for example, anti-inflammatories, antidiabetic treatment, or some form of aspirin.\n\nWhile Ritalin alone has been recommended for many chronic and cancer groups for many years, Rifkin noted that it is important that clinicians discuss options with their family members for Ritalin treatment, adding that the best approach is to have it available so that patients are able to get it when they do have symptoms. Ritalin therapy can be applied to treat pain and increase appetite, especially if the patient is over 50.\n\nWhen asked if the combination treatment is the best way to manage these problems, Dr. Rifkin reiterated that he does not recommend the use of Ritalin in conjunction with other treatment options.\n\n\"Although our research indicates that combining therapies may be both effective at reduced cancer risk, it is imperative that we review the evidence regarding Ritalin if we do not want to reduce our cancer risk,\" said Dr. Rifkin.\n\n\"While I can't recommend Ritalin for this particular chronic or cancer group, it should be available for chronic treatments for which people can be considered,\" said Dr. Rifkin.\n\nIf you or someone you recognize is at risk for cancer, please contact medical or health care professionals right away.","token_len":466,"entropy":[11.0936,0.1028,0.9314,6.6734,9.1393,0.1556,8.2845,6.6779,1.8006,8.2301,9.3871,9.1817,1.6381,0.9244,1.3412,4.1982,3.5126,1.776,1.0897,5.1058,8.157,5.0544,8.3481,9.5828,1.5585,4.4763,0.2999,1.4557,3.9135,4.9352,1.2927,9.855,0.0832,6.4516,18.3637,7.7582,5.0236,3.5887,1.3496,1.5465,0.0065,4.1608,4.7086,1.7792,0.3962,4.6942,3.1195,0.2732,3.692,1.4401,1.1696,3.5388,2.7163,4.8993,4.0041,0.5109,0.4377,4.0113,5.9768,3.6524,0.0002,4.1917,3.247,0.2216,7.4803,1.7319,2.8384,5.1677,0.0631,0.0568,0.7524,4.0654,2.3044,4.3914,0.0021,3.6028,5.6354,1.1698,3.3194,2.4946,0.6114,3.962,0.4075,1.5384,0.0003,2.5346,4.3367,2.5992,4.1691,0.514,6.2153,3.9353,0.8146,1.7968,2.9557,3.9352,0.027,2.603,3.1578,1.9376,2.6942,2.7455,2.4591,4.9934,2.1476,2.9058,0.3414,0.7614,0.876,1.3434,1.1077,5.6362,4.2309,5.2319,0.2624,0.1582,2.2667,0.0855,1.9695,5.4624,0.5757,6.4901,1.2315,2.6179,1.2251,2.5103,0.9079,1.1329,1.502,0.5995,2.1384,3.8261,1.5403,1.7363,5.928,3.9775,0.942,2.9223,2.7364,2.4379,5.2746,2.1391,0.2199,4.1602,2.3082,0.9741,2.0511,4.3271,1.8331,1.9055,1.193,1.626,2.508,1.8607,5.2118,1.4687,1.7557,0.8929,1.6383,4.1326,1.1296,5.7276,1.3366,0.1287,0.0002,5.3095,2.9834,2.3189,3.2431,3.1032,3.3286,2.4134,0.8996,5.3339,2.9835,2.0786,5.7969,5.2916,0.2321,1.6655,0.0039,0.303,0.0012,0.0012,0.5071,2.2592,2.8713,2.3452,1.6451,1.136,4.0049,0.0559,0.0054,2.1917,2.6341,3.2927,0.0665,2.5701,0.8279,1.4772,2.9303,3.3787,1.8888,5.3172,2.1267,0.1258,0.0426,3.3126,0.1895,3.7846,0.0245,1.2018,3.7167,2.7294,0.37,6.825,0.7146,1.6665,5.1497,3.2299,0.0025,5.3705,0.3947,0.4858,0.0002,4.3032,2.0564,0.0174,0.0042,4.7021,2.4317,1.3668,4.189,0.6324,3.5068,3.875,3.643,3.0355,6.0853,2.5651,2.4785,0.0857,0.0976,2.1524,0.4976,0.0024,3.3314,0.2415,2.0098,1.101,3.5231,1.9095,5.9334,5.6765,2.9244,1.9596,1.5355,5.4248,1.5078,3.4391,4.0809,0.0011,0.0053,2.8509,2.1049,5.2529,0.3611,2.6302,4.1759,3.0144,0.8259,0.61,3.2852,3.5447,3.7011,6.023,0.8166,1.7412,2.3584,2.0084,0.0045,3.114,1.3758,2.784,0.4177,5.202,2.9347,3.1429,0.6112,4.1116,0.0309,0.0077,4.3601,2.1214,1.0693,4.6988,1.001,4.3614,3.8558,1.8379,5.1191,2.5142,0.9831,4.6372,1.7487,1.7253,0.9121,0.8821,4.7163,2.2168,1.2118,0.3836,0.0002,4.7771,1.4067,1.1975,2.7903,4.4693,4.2937,2.2214,2.1829,0.6544,2.4484,0.2586,2.3038,4.4077,3.4325,0.1916,0.2597,0.0006,0.1517,0.0006,0.0008,5.9508,0.3388,2.8995,1.8866,0.0685,1.392,3.1081,0.5233,0.0039,1.4488,0.0006,0.0043,2.3796,3.8956,0.0032,1.2309,4.172,0.4661,0.726,0.6822,0.0002,0.633,5.6233,4.9568,2.0081,2.377,0.3823,4.8636,4.5909,2.4911,0.937,5.9741,0.7664,4.8216,6.3876,2.7746,0.5091,1.5125,1.8831,0.5436,4.735,0.3229,1.8497,4.9295,1.2745,2.5172,4.5196,2.1966,0.0005,0.0075,5.8202,0.8098,3.7213,0.4888,1.9756,0.3954,3.8403,2.4333,1.8396,0.3083,0.5571,2.187,0.1372,0.0005,0.157,0.0008,0.0014,0.0986,0.7958,0.0002,3.0096,3.8657,3.5926,3.9565,1.5002,2.324,1.1741,0.0004,0.0073,1.498,4.3427,2.3975,6.0115,2.4247,0.6798,0.4171,0.3461,1.6504,3.6499,0.2985,2.9807,1.9984,6.1457,6.6782,2.8333,3.3973,4.449,2.6789,2.5258,4.2512,2.0306,1.2609,0.2078,0.0008,0.3298,0.0006,0.0015,0.1018,0.8634,0.0002,4.7807,0.2887,1.6874,0.4662,0.0203,7.1017,0.7265,2.5902,0.3377,0.7033,1.4418,0.4471,1.7549,1.0907,6.5254,3.476,2.531,0.5125,0.9555,3.6655,0.0353,0.9115]}

The movie has reached number two with 20,000 sold, a number that is expected to go up and is expected to be up 80 percent higher than its pre-release date of 4,900 copies. This means that the movie won't go on to hit 2 million globally in any number of territories. In its first week of sales, the movie is up 40 percent over 2008's 'Basketcase' (34,000) where it climbed 34 percent.\n\nThe movie also made its way into the Top 100 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time with an opening reception of 3 million on Monday.\n\nOn Friday's tour, the film got two days to sell.

The film has been hit hard by the recession and in the last week has done well with a strong performance with the new opening.\n\nThe film will be released on March 7 for the first time ever over the UK. The movie will be followed by 'Someday', 'Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt' for the next 4 weeks, and 'Losing It' on the UK chart at the end of May.\n\nWatch new video: See more of the latest movie news.\n\nSource : THR, Billboard","token_len":470,"entropy":[6.237,3.0738,3.051,1.572,4.1348,0.3452,13.9032,4.5514,5.67,0.2496,0.5134,4.8287,3.2955,3.1404,0.9265,0.1196,0.9289,3.62,3.5169,1.8415,3.9188,7.4528,16.0713,7.3156,7.8677,9.45,6.8954,2.7653,0.9713,0.2454,0.2167,1.304,3.4091,2.2098,3.3133,0.6219,1.1025,1.1193,0.1114,0.0498,0.0142,5.1352,5.7627,4.5761,1.0988,2.8994,0.2157,2.7294,0.7879,1.7593,1.1848,0.7047,0.0003,1.9803,5.667,4.2311,4.1785,5.1553,1.4963,0.4937,3.2075,1.7291,5.168,0.7011,0.5801,1.0957,0.4841,2.4858,3.7371,1.8597,1.7514,3.2854,4.2572,0.9011,1.1751,5.7731,0.3829,0.2817,4.8745,1.2937,2.8723,3.6518,1.8742,5.4412,1.6956,0.1017,3.6286,1.7632,2.9761,0.3744,0.9637,3.5146,1.5379,1.1989,0.0892,0.6529,2.7582,0.1229,1.0513,6.2709,3.5381,3.6152,3.8946,4.0819,2.8172,6.3036,3.7644,1.9955,1.9009,5.208,1.799,2.3634,6.9002,0.1138,0.5889,2.7532,4.4905,2.2423,0.3565,2.2979,0.0,0.6843,2.1034,1.4412,2.1788,5.412,4.0253,0.3813,5.0415,4.7156,3.512,2.8668,5.248,1.8258,0.8847,1.6687,2.4127,3.9636,1.7188,6.5024,0.5841,0.5976,0.5543,0.0002,3.064,0.723,4.6705,0.2055,0.5011,0.5334,0.1045,0.9952,0.0044,0.0058,0.005,0.4145,1.7327,3.8811,0.0799,5.6259,0.1505,0.1648,0.8889,0.716,0.6345,1.5181,0.5642,7.7513,0.0704,5.5523,0.024,5.1189,1.1103,3.1864,0.6448,1.4294,0.8192,1.3246,3.304,2.3961,2.2278,3.4865,5.5612,1.7749,0.5581,3.4333,2.5176,2.9061,2.6688,0.7022,1.6331,3.352,0.0436,3.9993,0.1424,4.996,2.8383,1.412,0.0145,2.7369,2.7405,5.3257,0.051,6.1969,0.685,2.178,4.2989,0.0949,0.5926,5.5336,1.6105,4.6728,0.6219,4.0189,2.9348,0.3075,4.7963,4.0947,0.6124,1.1374,0.9892,5.7114,0.1382,4.0329,1.9459,1.1331,3.6581,5.561,0.8588,6.1903,2.6462,4.7175,4.3268,0.087,1.5308,0.6996,4.0713,1.0147,1.2092,0.0801,0.3008,1.2772,0.0672,1.0954,0.2457,0.959,0.2566,3.992,0.0181,1.26,3.7586,0.1167,0.1711,4.9444,5.131,2.7963,1.021,2.9507,5.1248,0.1264,0.5417,1.4232,5.4074,0.29,3.4679,5.0498,0.062,1.5071,0.7399,0.0002,1.7959,1.4994,3.171,3.6476,1.5255,2.6471,2.0104,0.5534,1.3765,2.592,1.7215,0.6243,1.5464,1.3169,0.0231,2.514,0.5436,0.6228,0.0874,2.449,2.1223,0.0347,0.6863,0.0578,3.9176,1.5205,4.043,4.0552,1.1031,2.1412,0.0002,3.9284,2.3029,4.4068,5.6095,0.2529,0.9571,2.0752,5.7034,5.2898,5.2033,1.9979,2.6592,3.1008,1.4779,5.3222,2.0971,2.9421,2.0921,0.3252,1.3244,3.5483,4.8776,4.6057,1.2341,2.892,0.8192,0.0144,1.8801,5.6869,6.0499,2.6276,1.5138,4.5423,1.3205,4.296,3.9399,2.9514,0.4494,4.0648,1.276,3.3162,3.909,5.9941,1.2691,2.8106,2.6425,0.3654,4.6109,4.3994,0.0044,2.2168,0.3637,0.2101,3.978,1.4346,3.6526,4.1938,4.2178,2.1252,3.1256,0.2247,1.8683,1.5979,1.8012,2.3913,5.1418,3.3523,0.8535,1.3216,4.362,1.2118,5.4383,1.5832,1.8896,1.1263,1.374,4.8934,1.1424,2.161,1.9615,3.5553,3.6766,3.8408,3.0343,4.3486,5.2544,2.6689,0.7197,0.0002,1.6837,1.4964,3.2885,0.9182,0.9115,0.937,3.2436,3.0711,4.2647,1.7585,1.4973,0.012,4.4874,7.9631,0.7905,3.2701,1.4384,1.8099,1.9228,1.5084,0.8457,3.9641,0.5037,1.32,3.2855,0.2513,0.003,1.6166,1.7177,5.6392,2.388,0.0032,0.5038,0.0123,0.0072,0.5298,4.9716,0.7604,4.0811,4.3787,0.6362,0.9936,0.4052,0.3733,3.1027,0.0391,0.1077,0.1812,1.0233,0.5509,1.1589,0.5508,4.673,0.9725,0.2646,0.0039,2.4887,0.1582,0.8828,0.0002,3.7626,5.771,2.3183,3.5923,5.373,2.162,2.4747,1.0632,2.0335,4.1475,1.6792,2.8447,1.0191,0.0002,3.9618,5.2578,5.4006,2.9029,1.5911]}
{"id":3057,"ended":false,"length":447,"gen_text":"Around the same time that she approached Carter about writing an episode, Anderson was also receiving offers from several television networks to direct shows. She, however, had never directed before, and never had any involvement in the production of those films. As Anderson's co-producer in 2001, John O'Dwyer, she has provided extensive commentary to the project, both as a regular contributor and on-air staff.\nWith this in mind, Anderson continues to work and is currently in Australia for three series, and will appear in four more, including three specials on Thursday nights, and in four new episodes, the first one in 2014 with two featurettes set to air on the following Saturday; one special on Monday nights, and a series. In addition to producing the pilot of The Day After: Los Angeles, Anderson has also produced the first ever comedy specials series, The Next Movie: One Shot. She also directs several episodes of The Day After: Atlanta, and the new series'One Shot with Dr. Walter Smith, a documentary about the life, work and personal lives of his wife, Karen. She recently completed a part in The Big Bang Theory: The Theory of Hostility.\nAnderson recently interviewed a number of women, including actress Kristen Klimes (The Big Bang Theory), TV legend Betty Carullo, actress Lucy Munro, actress Sarah Paulsen, co-founder of the Sex Pistols (including 'Sex Pistols', The Naked and Famous, and the upcoming 'The Good Wife'), and author Ann Coulter. They also spoke about their personal experiences working on Anderson's scripts.\nAfter this interview, Anderson said, \"I'm glad that the series has become such a significant part of my life. I feel like it's a really interesting character and this is certainly something I'm trying to do, so all the women I've talked to I've heard that are interested in acting in any field. The fact that I've been able to talk myself into a role that I can direct it out in, where this is so important, when you are going through this, is good for me. It gives me the chance to go, what I've always wanted to do.. And the fact that it's being done and I can do things I never dreamed about even as part of the show is absolutely amazing!\"","token_len":470,"entropy":[2.7641,1.4987,0.228,3.481,3.706,6.7616,8.5441,1.9444,5.1028,2.8752,4.4516,1.6422,7.3323,2.8482,3.4918,6.0402,4.5636,0.6845,3.6888,3.6292,0.7702,2.0448,2.6222,6.3171,2.2161,2.2595,6.1415,2.6453,0.0042,2.853,2.9324,4.5675,5.5471,1.3878,0.617,4.0254,2.0665,1.771,3.7482,0.8972,1.2584,1.5669,0.5163,4.0019,4.3795,0.2905,4.1615,2.7751,1.554,5.3052,0.0172,1.389,0.0042,4.0481,5.747,0.4133,4.8732,4.4122,0.6051,3.5025,1.7757,0.0014,0.6155,1.3537,4.482,5.5555,4.1505,3.1849,4.0341,1.5685,5.134,1.3021,4.6584,2.8008,0.676,5.5916,1.3565,0.8312,3.7897,2.5314,1.6903,5.9214,1.8036,1.1736,12.1339,3.6122,1.4232,0.005,0.0313,1.3338,5.0901,0.1197,1.9965,5.6077,3.3275,2.2014,2.8775,6.4967,2.0785,5.7658,3.2273,2.1312,3.2701,2.5316,2.3679,1.173,4.1829,1.2107,2.906,1.7137,4.5965,4.8869,1.7121,6.0484,1.2363,2.4173,2.4847,2.5686,3.723,2.928,1.0998,2.5359,3.9737,1.4234,4.8231,2.917,4.5865,5.664,5.214,5.7512,1.0916,6.1629,0.2958,0.4035,1.2987,2.608,4.9771,2.6964,5.6977,4.2724,2.3606,1.6673,2.3058,0.7319,1.2169,0.9128,2.1815,3.6109,7.2759,2.9924,1.1649,0.6964,4.3657,1.646,3.5945,3.2644,2.4696,5.8222,1.0917,4.9921,5.9613,0.246,0.5797,0.639,1.706,1.183,1.8455,1.969,3.4079,4.2443,4.2198,3.9515,3.6286,1.3637,1.738,5.761,5.0227,1.5988,6.0005,4.4118,2.7384,1.908,1.7076,4.4136,4.1472,2.0049,0.3124,1.846,3.9137,0.0817,1.052,5.6866,0.6069,1.6202,2.7817,3.6277,1.6116,6.5671,13.6053,0.1391,4.6448,6.0728,0.0497,4.9289,4.8816,1.2806,3.2357,3.8891,1.2728,0.9758,3.3338,3.3276,1.1512,0.6185,3.7237,1.3119,0.0119,5.1762,2.0139,0.7099,4.6993,1.4276,2.2123,3.4605,2.9315,1.0915,5.2055,1.8938,2.4394,4.1537,1.4566,0.0042,2.8279,1.8683,4.4334,0.213,9.0717,0.9339,1.6796,0.6817,0.9799,3.9543,5.2591,4.3535,1.6473,0.0009,4.4443,2.6963,0.452,3.1827,5.3474,6.4894,0.5242,2.7967,2.5862,2.8035,0.0059,0.0391,0.8707,5.4739,4.1199,5.4087,5.9419,4.9498,0.1174,2.292,2.633,5.4858,4.6533,1.1417,0.9637,2.1167,4.6593,1.7051,2.5215,0.5256,5.8326,0.02,3.0794,0.335,1.3716,5.3107,0.9983,0.0004,3.3111,4.2371,6.8467,3.912,0.3894,0.0065,3.8391,4.4934,5.4012,1.7435,0.5033,1.7359,1.5701,2.5425,3.8281,2.948,2.4933,5.6908,0.3423,1.1649,0.9318,5.1704,5.6975,2.4201,0.3519,4.7134,1.5119,1.6274,0.541,1.1513,2.9848,1.3337,3.152,1.8453,3.597,0.113,4.2599,1.3379,0.4718,5.4934,4.6048,0.2494,0.2434,0.4162,5.0389,1.2214,0.2274,0.7949,1.7698,4.2486,1.6624,2.907,4.9886,1.6521,3.4671,1.7777,0.2811,5.1417,0.1785,0.0317,0.4573,0.1257,0.8069,0.917,3.1141,0.881,1.5989,0.8319,1.9077,3.348,3.4403,4.503,2.1247,5.2464,1.2263,5.9954,1.8223,0.8563,1.8304,3.3479,0.0277,1.6571,3.1816,2.8892,5.8806,1.4335,3.2424,2.3754,0.9627,2.0992,0.0949,5.3295,1.4403,3.3586,3.5027,2.704,2.4079,0.3923,4.9339,2.9667,4.4662,5.4628,1.231,3.4337,2.2319,0.113,1.4252,1.4309,1.4833,1.2425,0.003,3.4451,7.0937,0.3354,3.0455,1.0862,1.6705,1.0922,2.8801,5.2398,5.2628,5.8773,3.1328,2.7778,4.5987,5.264,0.9071,3.3905,2.611,1.3346,6.3803,1.8603,4.0339,4.5723,1.8831,2.2517,2.3976,1.739,5.9264,2.0172,0.9852,1.1008,1.555,2.7716,0.2389,1.9482,2.2379,0.0351,3.5778,3.7164,5.8162,1.5073,2.1329,1.2941,0.3999,0.2657,0.1639,9.4219,4.2189,3.2382,0.926,0.0773,1.8244,0.4708,4.0676,1.3241,3.0689,2.0017,2.0137,2.13,4.8162,2.2976,2.4062,3.1473,2.7262,6.153,4.1658,5.6815,0.0019,1.5298,1.9261,2.3853,4.8918,1.5723,4.0024]}
{"id":3872,"ended":false,"length":466,"gen_text":"In May 2016, Bell revealed that she has struggled with and received help for depression and anxiety. She said, `` It \u2019 s important for me to be candid about this so I understand how much that pressure is coming to my body, and that I have to speak because of my depression.'' ''I did feel sorry for those that I didn't get help for,'' she said. When asked if she had used drugs, Bell replied, ``No, I mean it's because I was so emotionally challenged and stressed out and that's what I struggled with.'' According to Bell, her depression is so intense that she has taken medication to deal with it. When contacted by The Daily Breeze, Bell said, `` I would like to speak to some of our doctors about this. I don't want any one or anything to overshadow me and to see more doctors being able to help me with my depression. It's amazing how many doctors can provide me with really good care, and help me with what I'm stuck in, and not so focused on the side effects.'' Bell said,`` I'm very positive about it.'' '' This may be the most powerful line of defense and I can feel confident moving forward on my own, because I won't have to ask any of our doctors or therapists for help,'' Bell said. Despite her depression, Bell has been able to continue working on her self-care initiative:\n\n...The Internet is such a vital tool in my life and I had always found that my life's the most important thing in my life because I could never live as a living person without being a self-made man. But I will always be mindful of that because when you start to become aware of yourself, then you can learn a lot about yourself.'' '' When I realized that this is how my time at my desk is changing, and where I am now in my career as a director of digital marketing, then I had to start seeing how different my day was so that I could choose the day I want. The work at work where I am now can only be through the free Internet. This is what has really opened up me to the opportunities that I've had in my life. It's given me something I can use as a platform that opens up a lot of new possibilities.\n\n--The Daily Breeze","token_len":470,"entropy":[7.7673,3.2148,0.1487,8.9703,7.5419,0.7282,2.7962,3.4045,6.4158,0.5062,6.9324,6.3892,6.2723,3.4856,2.1835,1.5442,1.0131,1.7185,1.735,2.2791,2.9514,8.9719,8.014,13.4792,7.6412,6.6194,5.0592,1.7633,0.3367,0.2762,2.0897,7.3764,1.0778,2.1003,4.7177,1.2054,5.5075,2.2666,2.4968,4.3731,5.5114,1.9996,4.4782,3.4842,1.1631,2.6416,2.2037,1.1821,2.7891,1.4307,2.0408,0.8214,5.4481,7.3533,2.0336,2.6032,1.2004,2.052,5.9294,1.8819,5.3678,3.6864,5.9141,0.1444,5.4224,2.4122,1.7158,3.8349,0.187,2.7607,1.6794,0.6797,1.4557,0.5175,0.7112,0.3082,5.1282,1.3752,1.2565,0.3226,2.3628,5.0588,1.8713,0.9695,1.145,2.6613,0.2342,0.2038,2.7129,0.6284,0.6331,4.2297,2.9066,1.862,5.3292,0.6008,2.0566,3.6962,5.2634,5.2253,1.8263,5.0572,1.2823,2.2885,2.9716,1.574,1.6089,1.2744,5.9694,0.0802,1.1803,5.3367,0.0008,1.0819,0.2274,2.1898,2.6884,2.729,3.653,1.8924,0.4145,0.441,1.7752,3.8507,2.5939,1.0536,3.3299,0.0015,0.5838,0.2886,3.9796,4.1752,0.4381,2.033,1.9716,6.626,0.0023,0.4,0.4986,0.9263,0.8668,0.2387,1.6282,4.2088,2.6661,0.1433,4.106,1.0759,3.5162,0.5705,4.4932,2.9585,1.3073,1.8785,1.6902,0.9524,2.8216,0.0486,1.6158,4.3989,4.51,5.0342,2.9081,0.2949,5.0044,2.3773,2.3799,3.6817,4.0341,5.7171,4.2829,5.2581,1.274,0.0045,0.9148,0.3529,3.1374,1.5005,0.8224,1.2374,2.2961,0.7913,4.971,1.5058,1.5528,1.6311,3.1027,4.4322,3.1072,0.2505,5.8616,1.4722,2.279,2.1187,1.2012,4.4644,0.2644,2.147,3.337,0.4049,1.6356,5.4194,0.9065,2.3918,0.9832,3.9599,4.3736,4.4113,0.0661,2.4123,4.0326,1.44,1.8266,1.0065,1.2352,1.7726,5.7389,1.0248,2.4255,3.0039,5.5487,1.7819,2.6311,2.8103,4.5595,5.5647,5.0869,1.2252,0.9998,1.8214,4.1318,5.2587,1.0398,0.9906,5.3552,4.2625,3.4967,5.0395,5.5085,6.5917,0.0134,4.1646,1.6856,1.1953,2.4272,2.0877,0.6192,6.0198,0.0975,1.9025,0.2601,4.9432,3.0815,1.5238,3.3534,0.2478,2.8281,3.4269,1.5813,0.2983,3.8753,0.9931,0.3412,0.1675,5.7964,1.2643,3.1438,0.1888,0.2721,2.2677,1.7177,1.6464,0.0069,3.4999,1.927,1.515,0.2573,4.3067,0.078,3.0266,4.6808,5.0235,4.6373,0.1473,5.4165,5.4224,5.9727,1.81,4.7751,0.2871,5.4598,1.0691,1.9074,1.3997,0.4246,2.0668,0.8427,5.3593,4.854,4.4544,2.1782,3.5025,2.9183,4.4006,5.9949,0.969,0.6122,1.1581,1.6509,1.542,0.1177,3.6754,0.8887,3.176,2.8929,4.3152,5.3487,1.4853,4.5491,0.9418,1.1108,3.3171,2.1927,4.4006,0.3257,2.1332,2.1797,0.7631,4.522,1.5617,5.3078,1.7546,1.5832,5.1171,0.3195,1.8373,2.8252,4.0179,2.8434,4.1985,1.1068,4.5735,2.6828,0.2296,1.8869,1.2366,4.5094,0.6719,1.8351,3.7226,3.3252,0.2486,0.7141,0.148,4.3213,3.5125,4.6818,0.4936,4.7733,0.7544,3.9071,1.7367,3.2376,2.5211,6.6222,5.3753,3.17,2.9757,1.9866,5.1655,0.4818,2.219,5.8758,0.4772,1.169,1.6393,2.8863,0.7275,2.5047,3.0342,0.3737,4.9419,0.7977,4.4464,1.2744,0.5101,4.5962,0.3716,3.3356,1.215,2.9102,4.0865,2.8488,5.164,1.7483,3.6645,2.2891,5.4307,0.7608,0.2483,0.2056,5.5387,1.7044,1.4588,1.8166,2.3429,4.1901,3.7709,4.9447,3.7801,3.6067,5.8007,0.2214,2.5829,0.5391,3.8756,3.5904,1.0523,5.8637,1.8079,6.4248,2.9911,1.3418,4.1482,1.0446,2.4462,4.1394,2.949,3.5842,1.4339,2.8141,0.7249,1.6505,3.6249,1.1472,0.9408,2.6041,1.533,1.658,0.7659,0.397,1.1141,2.3136,0.8559,5.5729,0.0275,4.5184,2.7099,1.8053,2.8831,2.971,0.6392,5.0184,2.9349,6.0509,0.5736,2.429,1.0991,0.3654,1.8045,1.5301,1.9685,2.7651,0.0004,3.5864,5.33,1.2198,0.0179,0.0007]}

{"id":3857,"ended":true,"length":435,"gen_text":"On 3 October 2014 the Sydney Morning Herald reported that former franchisees asserted that the current franchisor, NBC Capital, had stopped print and media advertising since purchasing the business. The number of outlets where Murdoch has bought Fox News has been climbing rapidly, with the likes of ABC, BBC and other broadcaster all adding their own franchises to the ABC to become 'partner' companies, despite its failure to achieve widespread mass exposure.\n\n\"With this situation, [the Murdochs] and the news media company have made no secret of their inability to control where advertising is sold and how it is distributed. This has led to some journalists being forced to go with the Murdochs.\"\n\nIn the US, the Murdoch family has recently had to face up to the ethical issues involved. A Fox News spokesperson confirmed that:\n\n\"When asked what media representatives are trying to do to try to prevent the Murdochs from becoming partners, an ABC spokesperson said: 'The ABC has a long and history of supporting independent news organisations, and there is no change here.\"\n\nThere is a long-standing story that the Murdochs have spent millions on public relations campaigns in the US in which they have tried to avoid conflicts of interest. These included the publication of the American Public Affairs Committee (APAC) report on Fox News where they claimed that the channel's CEO, Rupert Murdoch, had donated $1.9m to the campaign. However, despite their reputation as a source of media and business integrity, the ABC has repeatedly denied the existence of any such donation. Murdoch has consistently denied the allegations. As the New York Times reports :\n\nFox News's recent news-driven ads include a commercial for a brand owned by the Murdochs that reads \"The Murdochs are not on our lists of donors and this ad should never have been allowed into a New York Times publication.\"\n\nEven after Fox Sports Channel's Murdoch is named publisher in an upcoming year's election, this story is still on for the remainder of 2014.

{"id":3364,"ended":true,"length":443,"gen_text":"Upon its release, the video received general acclaim from critics and fans. James Montgomery from MTV described it as a love @ - @ letter to the band's fans and a document of 'love' that would finally be taken down. But many fans of the band were upset at the video's portrayal of Kacey Musgraves.\n\nAn online petition asking the BBC to censor the video has received over 200,000 signatures so far. Many of those who signed said they planned to join a protest outside the BBC on Thursday night, November 30, at 1:00pm, but no one has already pledged to do so. The protest will now feature performances of the song 'I Know Love Was Real' on the BBC's Radio 4 news programme, with songs such as 'I Couldnt Get Wet' by Pink Floyd.\n\nMany more petitioners have also been posted online calling for the BBC to stop broadcasting the video after it was published. 'These are the people who are supporting me and it shows that there is so much hate and negativity towards my band and their fans. I've been through it with my fans. I couldn't get any safer in this country or feel confident anymore as I know I wouldn't last too long without my band. But if you can't stand these people, please stop broadcasting this tape. Please, do whatever it takes so we will change the way our music is heard... '\n\nMORE: The BBC has changed its copyright policy after video found on YouTube\n\nOne supporter of the petition said he was 'disheartened as they had lost all hope that the BBC would be able to support me'. His statement comes as Britain's Labour MP Andrew Mitchell says he is taking \"a stand against hate speech\" and demands that the broadcaster take action against \"malicious tweets and offensive language\".\n\n'The BBC should stop airing this tape as a threat to our audience, journalists and fans,' he said. 'It is time for an unapologetic British government to take action and condemn the video where this vile form of expression is used to incite hatred.'\n\nThe song will be played alongside the BBC's Radio 4, which was founded in 2001 to promote free speech and the internet\n\nA third protest is planned on Saturday night. The petition has been sent 15,000 words and written by 19 people.","token_len":475,"entropy":[5.8596,2.7535,0.8786,1.1483,6.0839,5.4335,8.1945,1.6359,2.1678,1.979,0.9652,2.9305,1.8608,8.7969,9.163,5.708,6.1763,3.9662,0.7251,0.0857,1.7994,7.1866,17.5539,8.9898,5.3267,8.6607,1.2652,1.9884,6.5571,2.7652,0.9452,2.9775,2.718,9.2843,0.6227,5.6349,3.0131,1.7293,1.8629,3.4627,5.5268,3.1836,4.4008,3.0497,0.7945,5.3156,4.4859,1.8783,3.5387,0.589,0.8815,2.6828,3.784,2.8632,0.4291,2.2018,1.228,3.2352,0.0419,6.0877,4.3973,0.063,0.0009,0.0005,1.8035,0.8014,0.0015,5.846,2.3687,0.2039,3.9322,1.3231,4.1417,0.3129,3.7102,0.231,0.3116,1.2102,2.4521,0.9269,3.7731,0.2379,0.0046,0.0288,3.5256,0.0023,0.5229,4.4872,1.5803,1.5736,1.4219,1.2022,3.5912,0.783,5.8004,0.0795,4.4192,2.5615,2.0369,2.4557,0.5752,1.1495,1.9242,3.0725,2.8555,2.2271,5.7426,3.6132,1.747,2.2385,3.7591,3.7581,1.0177,0.3642,3.1985,4.0976,4.5051,2.061,1.2456,5.3497,4.7422,0.3956,1.6489,0.0401,0.1136,3.2469,3.3666,1.1459,4.5085,6.5811,4.7877,2.4926,1.4052,2.0099,1.7489,3.236,3.1562,5.0264,6.567,4.2321,0.9893,3.4142,1.3689,0.8214,1.3208,2.9806,0.3033,5.1038,1.2182,2.0869,3.0778,5.6178,1.9811,0.0011,0.3665,2.1471,5.2559,2.2695,2.7592,4.4866,0.7794,2.7407,4.9877,0.1911,1.9874,0.3447,0.0003,4.8242,5.0817,3.9632,1.4285,1.3369,1.8401,2.7967,3.325,1.4328,3.2769,0.3051,0.4979,0.9697,0.0568,2.6714,2.2373,0.588,0.9341,4.675,1.1386,0.6008,3.0501,0.817,4.9474,5.6348,2.068,2.3706,1.5305,0.367,2.3388,5.2863,2.9695,1.6858,4.9253,3.9039,1.5436,3.0918,0.633,4.2211,0.0374,2.4135,1.4364,3.8906,2.234,3.534,1.2277,1.6139,2.6313,1.0845,1.8851,1.694,3.9507,1.7341,4.0262,2.7826,3.3495,1.4069,2.3092,2.8469,1.0988,5.3979,0.0002,0.4499,3.045,5.7609,3.4439,1.9919,1.6148,3.9174,6.0814,5.5738,4.7743,4.4519,1.9056,3.5543,2.1686,3.8008,0.0009,6.1608,4.0864,0.014,1.7638,2.3284,1.3397,1.6978,4.0293,3.5245,1.674,2.6167,0.5044,2.6323,4.0448,0.8943,1.2097,2.8837,1.5753,1.5954,1.5618,5.544,1.9369,3.0079,3.534,3.8346,4.0293,1.8499,0.0321,5.3449,1.7974,4.8301,5.9024,1.0736,1.3678,3.4115,1.5953,0.1415,1.2914,6.9031,4.2844,0.6591,0.0002,5.7171,0.391,3.1092,2.4791,2.466,5.0687,0.6261,6.0845,0.3057,1.988,3.852,5.0943,2.9174,1.824,1.2219,0.0003,6.2273,3.8647,1.3778,0.4594,0.5198,1.4354,3.4428,1.3417,2.0749,2.5396,2.8719,0.0004,6.6322,4.3166,4.6439,4.3779,2.9578,1.1285,2.8454,1.8008,1.0691,0.2444,2.9175,1.0612,0.0043,4.8554,2.7279,2.5528,5.271,4.3538,3.1737,1.7856,5.2881,0.6746,4.8362,2.5672,3.9252,2.7172,3.1426,1.1958,1.5424,5.0914,4.0979,3.097,1.7237,0.778,2.8664,0.7508,1.167,1.1851,6.0165,1.2778,0.3623,3.0099,2.934,1.3058,0.8747,3.0626,5.3204,0.0724,5.1563,1.4401,4.342,2.9483,0.8841,0.3732,0.0002,3.3831,2.5968,0.9056,1.8414,1.9057,2.9898,1.0564,1.9154,3.8508,2.8668,4.3115,0.2151,2.8667,4.059,2.2381,6.1375,0.3868,3.3902,1.2651,0.6595,0.6341,0.4553,0.7214,2.2343,1.1586,2.6507,0.9591,4.3448,6.1979,1.493,0.0864,4.6704,2.4435,0.2504,2.0958,1.2456,2.7549,4.6617,2.0261,3.6069,6.3859,4.2926,2.8809,5.8315,0.0092,5.5242,0.9285,2.6855,1.3598,2.669,0.4799,2.5852,0.3953,0.0004,1.8478,4.9513,4.848,0.4941,1.433,4.063,1.2681,1.8293,0.4715,3.0758,0.129,4.909,1.2303,4.1723,3.0476,0.6608,3.6392,2.5573,1.9237,4.5465,0.4744,1.264,2.9837,4.5329,4.2949,0.0004,3.3977,6.0982,3.9008,1.876,0.5277,2.3065,1.0359,1.136,3.7608,1.848,2.3879,1.6836,2.0143,4.9945,7.3205,0.2334,0.1878,4.8317,1.6827,4.7224,0.7694,5.2303,1.1906,1.2593]}
{"id":4755,"ended":true,"length":423,"gen_text":"Three days after the Brazilian Grand Prix, reports began to surface suggesting that Sebastian Vettel's championship was under threat and that Ferrari would be filing a formal protest against the race results.\n\nHowever, that did not happen since those reports were put to rest by Martin Brundle. In short: despite having won three consecutive races to the contrary- that's all Ferrari had to say about the race results on the record.\n\nHowever, during the third half of the 2016 season the Ferrari team didn't stop talking and taking action, and this is where the F1-focused website 'Mercedes' actually turns up. The page gives you two options:\n\nIf you look at their website you can find out for yourself what happened to Vettel with F1's 'Mercedes' logo:\n\nThe website also says \"Mercedes has asked that you report to our F1 HQ for review\"\n\nThis is a massive change in the situation, considering the history between what will be considered part of F1 and what will not, which is why it was so much of the media talk about it in the first place.\n\nIt also puts Mercedes on a collision course with Ferrari in a way that is totally unacceptable.\n\nAnd, although it is very unlikely that Mercedes will ever get the chance to drive the Mercedes, this is also something that can only happen if F1 teams will begin to realise what 'Mercedes' means to them.\n\nThat is something that we will discuss more in a future article.\n\nWhen it comes to F1, the F1 world can look at the facts and come out with their own conclusions about what 'Mercedes' means to the F1 world and also the F1 world can also judge what their respective teams want from Mercedes and Ferrari at the beginning of the season.\n\nAll this is done simply as a guide to what is'really being said', and what will be said later.\n\nSo\u2026\n\nWhile I can't be sure just how much this will affect Formula 1 when it comes to safety, it will certainly leave a scarlet cloud in the sport's future, because not only will F1's overall safety record continue to decline as they turn away from Mercedes and Ferrari, but Ferrari's future will also suffer, thanks to its actions in this regard.","token_len":476,"entropy":[6.4058,1.4263,1.2011,9.6413,5.1379,0.0012,0.6059,7.8374,2.875,0.7676,1.6759,3.481,0.6559,5.6653,0.0328,0.0001,2.202,5.8172,2.9994,4.5005,0.2176,3.5142,0.9282,3.076,2.3396,1.6857,8.45,1.2277,2.3035,3.6267,1.4877,1.0202,3.2653,5.2011,0.372,0.7772,0.0003,3.2317,0.0994,4.4236,3.0816,0.0435,1.5522,6.5605,6.2674,0.6311,1.2459,5.195,1.5818,0.5383,2.2488,5.8275,1.593,0.0023,0.0014,1.6624,3.3285,5.6307,3.8852,5.3146,3.2946,2.4032,2.962,2.9158,0.6366,3.8395,3.2116,5.6822,4.9405,5.2299,1.753,2.4901,3.6503,1.9781,0.2952,1.5221,1.3209,0.8395,2.38,0.5113,4.6343,1.8157,4.5271,0.6084,0.3115,0.0002,4.1017,0.0838,5.7596,0.9199,5.5702,4.6209,0.0277,0.5623,3.8177,0.2434,3.5958,2.9323,1.2376,4.9963,0.0007,3.7241,2.8362,2.6675,4.6067,1.7823,2.4226,2.2165,3.466,1.9427,1.8405,1.4432,4.4612,0.169,4.6589,4.0518,4.1218,5.0114,5.0514,0.0087,1.9627,5.1619,5.4582,1.3118,1.6396,2.7908,4.7196,4.7746,2.5772,4.8903,1.8992,1.0269,0.8226,0.0002,3.7637,0.1796,5.135,0.6238,4.237,2.4567,1.5942,1.2941,2.5036,3.0308,4.8224,0.374,1.7223,2.1969,1.7719,2.3926,0.0209,5.0528,5.5397,0.047,2.4963,3.6846,3.0171,0.0002,1.2515,1.9897,4.1248,0.2157,0.0002,2.5505,3.6321,1.471,3.7005,3.7677,1.9031,0.0001,3.0658,4.8662,2.6238,3.1453,5.3238,1.9936,3.5383,3.6085,0.0305,4.0409,2.2624,3.421,3.7538,3.0013,0.0002,2.9884,1.0726,2.3816,5.1881,3.4509,2.4083,1.6121,4.1064,1.6242,4.6228,1.5728,5.1839,2.7329,6.183,5.8097,1.4732,2.807,5.4607,0.107,1.7381,0.0061,0.4933,0.2054,0.6838,2.0191,2.2065,2.5338,1.138,1.6804,1.4816,2.3088,2.4984,4.0889,2.6868,1.6389,2.3189,5.5841,0.722,2.3454,3.2229,0.6652,0.6876,0.0091,0.1827,0.6666,0.0002,3.1144,2.6712,5.1304,4.6336,2.3408,1.9118,1.4191,0.0799,0.0484,1.366,2.6869,2.6629,2.355,0.394,2.3004,3.9689,2.6832,1.2549,1.1992,0.0001,3.615,2.8961,4.5683,1.6408,1.4405,4.0775,2.8645,0.3695,2.3375,0.6296,2.1597,3.0883,2.3103,1.7491,0.0943,4.7573,1.9114,3.4953,2.8658,3.2128,1.2548,3.8491,3.3345,0.4089,3.89,1.5225,1.3671,0.9706,2.9695,0.0109,3.3197,5.0105,5.0595,0.6168,5.231,2.7561,5.7524,0.3688,0.0001,0.165,0.6194,0.873,0.8309,0.5841,0.28,0.0002,4.3095,1.3375,3.7445,0.5122,3.4882,2.3157,4.0215,2.4927,0.5986,1.5166,1.1044,0.6591,0.7739,0.4656,0.0002,5.5005,2.3476,0.1144,0.0627,2.3641,0.0125,0.9668,2.1558,2.8502,0.0465,2.8566,3.7569,4.3171,1.0175,1.7257,5.498,1.5355,5.1358,4.139,0.4122,1.5463,0.4662,2.095,3.2064,0.9361,2.9134,0.0191,0.0001,0.0216,0.0877,0.5694,2.0035,1.4425,0.0067,0.6377,3.0917,4.5017,2.819,2.3058,0.0167,0.9605,0.4691,4.3395,5.941,1.8113,5.4552,5.635,1.5291,3.5296,1.7993,4.6701,2.1131,1.3024,4.8872,0.471,4.4598,0.1148,0.5292,0.8191,0.1683,0.3073,0.0002,5.0343,1.6616,1.4648,3.8368,4.9553,3.9105,0.6763,5.7458,1.2987,1.4144,2.3872,15.6785,10.8938,6.542,1.7431,13.295,1.3777,3.4072,3.9187,1.0255,1.8736,3.3629,1.1454,0.3226,0.0002,2.5365,5.5138,2.253,0.0001,5.5625,2.9413,3.0959,0.7411,4.0707,1.8151,5.228,0.7705,1.5148,3.6436,2.5943,1.4437,4.6625,0.3265,6.0105,0.7296,0.2283,0.0814,6.5541,0.7093,1.726,2.1115,1.5389,5.0337,1.5043,6.3598,2.5194,3.0895,2.8515,0.3795,5.1624,0.802,1.8379,2.8068,3.8814,4.8224,0.2889,0.8112,2.7762,0.0053,2.8061,5.4652,1.9343,0.9186,3.8435,0.0458,2.956,3.4971,4.4812,5.4246,4.6438,0.0301,2.9645,1.1046,0.1066,0.4062,0.3415,4.6284,1.1129,3.0086,1.5801,0.5337,2.3244,3.0267,5.8502,0.1645,3.3914,5.8604,1.8561,3.2698,1.8259,0.1252]}

Mr Miliband is a \"scoop\" with a large group of MPs\n\n'The whole thing is about being able to make a deal for working people in a way that is acceptable to them,' said Stephen Lewis, director of the NCPA.\n\nMr Lewis said one of the Conservatives' reasons for keeping the two divisions in the National Centre may be that the party did not 'cautiously' agree to an 'electoral deal' with the Labour government of Labour.\n\nIn response to a question at the National Press Club about Mr Miliband's performance in leadership, the prime minister said: \"His Labour-led government has been a good example of political courage and leadership.\"\n\n'That is what our political leaders need.'\n\nBut Mr Miliband is expected to take the lead in the race to become the next prime minister of the EU if Jeremy Corbyn succeeds in securing the party's nomination next month.\n\nBut the Tories could be struggling to take the lead after being tied with the Liberal Democrats and Independents behind the leader's Tory rivals, both Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates.\n\nAccording to the NCPA survey from September last year, only the Tories and Lib Dems had greater support than the Tories in the North West region of England, while the Liberal Democrats were ahead in Wales.","token_len":477,"entropy":[11.2177,3.6035,6.7052,8.7695,6.7917,3.4719,8.3179,2.4409,2.9361,0.017,3.4814,1.2226,1.5466,2.1361,1.7968,2.8627,1.3031,6.1987,1.0478,3.4254,2.4347,2.8684,1.5725,6.5298,5.9696,0.6165,4.5427,0.0095,1.1863,5.3217,0.9319,1.5667,3.14,4.1127,0.8815,4.0336,0.7648,1.4762,0.0008,6.2432,2.5319,4.9537,1.9069,0.9422,3.939,2.7813,2.3598,0.9748,2.6222,0.19,1.3028,3.6975,1.0717,3.5349,6.9508,1.7389,0.8864,5.402,1.9722,3.2003,3.2921,4.1303,4.5606,2.4446,1.2742,2.4459,2.8662,0.0002,2.5734,0.0246,4.5244,3.3012,1.5528,3.4767,1.7385,3.9541,0.6305,0.0031,3.7799,0.2792,0.9767,3.6946,3.7678,1.3137,0.963,6.3018,1.9534,0.4252,1.6077,0.7692,1.3556,2.3351,2.8115,7.3107,5.835,0.4973,0.1068,0.8374,0.3433,0.0003,2.492,6.0429,6.0351,0.511,4.0795,4.173,1.1691,3.9133,1.4091,4.8953,1.6448,3.9487,1.0686,2.8701,4.2264,2.1815,0.4379,4.5135,0.8589,5.0736,1.6733,5.2921,2.1262,1.5238,3.297,0.8051,0.1517,0.0003,1.8731,1.2943,5.0827,0.6305,3.4242,2.7606,0.04,0.6057,1.1136,2.0178,0.7136,2.8815,0.1899,2.6735,4.6683,4.6261,1.4014,5.4344,5.4998,1.3044,0.9738,0.4542,0.0039,1.5422,5.4923,4.4828,0.9153,2.4435,3.8017,0.0073,5.2102,2.9153,0.6612,3.2594,2.1047,2.0581,5.0269,4.9163,0.3316,4.4013,1.8104,5.7427,3.9157,0.2063,3.2992,1.9827,8.2863,1.8643,5.4799,2.1773,3.7975,0.0165,2.3954,1.8067,0.7197,1.345,0.1215,4.6513,0.6867,0.84,2.1621,0.2959,1.8309,2.3697,1.318,4.9769,4.6759,0.272,3.0156,2.2042,5.1589,0.2555,5.8678,3.2582,0.4463,2.5457,1.6671,2.8639,0.0005,1.7352,0.462,0.0748,3.2229,0.1471,1.958,1.8694,0.3011,0.1277,0.0014,0.0154,4.7738,0.028,0.0133,0.0039,0.0349,0.001,0.0027,1.52,0.0004,3.8684,2.2742,4.7826,2.2294,1.0541,2.4234,4.2614,2.1393,0.0208,3.9017,1.4495,3.6908,2.782,5.0167,0.235,3.2328,1.6028,1.5053,0.1298,1.7115,4.2896,0.4426,2.4543,2.2584,1.2447,5.3945,4.7798,0.2016,3.2005,0.127,0.5121,0.726,0.0003,0.6139,0.6014,0.0003,2.2662,0.5898,0.726,5.9854,0.6749,0.3541,5.8647,0.2679,5.1625,0.2669,4.8299,0.773,5.2665,4.2997,2.4271,1.1212,4.826,0.5008,6.5755,0.4989,1.4151,1.9065,1.5427,4.7309,0.0441,6.2355,5.0414,2.8018,0.0106,1.4694,2.7648,0.9551,3.6854,3.9453,4.4818,0.0874,3.6147,0.5838,0.9814,1.0102,1.0175,1.4718,4.4039,3.4835,1.3826,0.1688,0.0004,3.9057,4.3492,0.5212,2.2539,0.6257,4.2432,1.1665,2.6439,1.6187,0.0255,2.1332,2.0393,0.087,0.1481,4.2463,1.3146,5.7645,0.7391,2.1853,2.2464,0.0029,0.7971,0.599,0.3781,5.0206,5.2911,4.3101,1.0471,0.5377,1.4689,1.8262,2.0092,3.4503,2.445,0.4863,5.6928,3.6288,1.0996,2.5123,2.5329,0.1667,0.0003,2.1886,5.2101,1.6014,1.8047,4.9878,3.775,1.5967,2.3568,3.1115,2.1228,0.0002,2.8289,1.6151,0.6314,3.121,3.892,0.0289,4.0493,2.1806,1.8888,0.8411,0.8792,3.3856,1.4026,1.9053,1.1416,0.3217,1.5402,0.0026,2.1268,0.3613,4.9066,4.3861,5.9247,0.0072,4.1085,1.4865,1.9542,0.6328,2.1973,0.0434,1.9162,3.3415,1.0059,0.2609,0.3034,0.0005,4.6982,1.784,2.9162,3.966,2.1541,5.9975,0.272,5.0099,2.0098,0.9134,3.4343,4.2473,5.6767,1.5794,1.6401,1.7264,0.0396,2.3695,6.5166,0.0037,0.0003,4.9,1.3748,3.2164,2.3969,5.5503,1.244,1.3688,5.5767,2.0191,0.1566,2.6874,0.4359,6.0684,0.3877,0.2309,0.0005,5.3654,0.0059,0.4986,0.8562,0.0004,4.2996,5.6514,3.3304,3.1753,0.0176,0.1222,2.7741,4.3629,1.9156,1.6948,1.9713,0.1558,1.7897,6.0411,0.7951,1.3093,0.7374,2.5409,1.7985,0.8583,4.5303,1.3417,3.2633,1.107,1.1954,1.4679,2.7258,0.9853,2.1082,0.0597,1.5378,2.6708,1.2976,2.8857,1.6969]}

The singer and producer who wrote the review, David Boreanaz, posted it on his Twitter page and said it was'more than' the word she said she meant. An email from the singer to Billboard has not been returned. In February, Boreanaz shared the video on Instagram saying, ``Oh wow, I'm feeling so good about myself. I'm actually getting a new album, that's all it will ever be, but with more than one guy taking it away from me I can't stop thinking about it. If I'm going to change things... If you want more love, I know what to do. I can change you the way you want to change me. But if I'm going to give you any hope... I can help you change what will always be, and never again.'' Boreanaz has taken to Twitter to respond to some of the comments, including those in the context of the track. She wrote on her Twitter feed on Wednesday: ``I'm just a lucky person, I can't help but think that you might be a good influence on the way I live. I feel like this song is something so important right now. I may not know you... So what if you want more love, I don't know what I'll do.'' In an interview conducted at the end of January, Boreanaz said as much, adding: ``I can look at it this way and it can be a little more interesting when you see how it comes out. I have a lot of experience writing songs, you know? Yeah. So this I feel like I'm trying to do, I am putting this out here in a very honest and clear way... So, where's the motivation for you? I just felt that it wasn't the right time to sing about it-- I just felt it was too big and big when it was going on. This was bigger for me. It was not going to help me, it was just not the time.

I am glad that my friend is now considering her approach to feminist discourse. Her work is one part of a multi-lingual field of interdisciplinary work involving many different approaches to women and women's issues, and I am honored by her support. My hope is that her work will lead to a stronger critique of postmodern feminist theory and the use of language as a tool to address gender inequality and how we can work to address it in a more comprehensive and open way.","token_len":479,"entropy":[9.1943,7.6379,6.8885,12.6945,2.859,14.8478,1.625,10.3313,6.2548,1.2632,1.069,3.6523,3.7789,10.6774,11.0666,7.2477,4.1975,3.7723,6.8859,1.6406,9.0475,6.3291,6.5663,4.9418,9.1471,1.5578,6.9133,2.7923,10.9388,4.7475,0.0019,0.0353,8.83,1.2666,8.3663,8.7798,8.6552,7.8191,1.5703,2.9806,4.0594,0.0675,0.7681,3.4668,4.5078,0.5131,4.8244,1.1699,2.1083,0.6485,6.3402,1.5448,3.7535,1.86,5.6843,2.606,5.0842,2.4985,4.5735,4.8457,3.6367,0.4101,3.9167,2.0943,0.9262,4.8867,2.4702,2.7698,4.7269,0.5683,2.7625,0.1327,7.6715,3.0759,0.2762,0.0012,0.0093,5.0849,0.0415,0.1677,0.5272,0.0177,0.0043,0.0005,0.0071,0.0112,0.0004,0.0228,0.0024,0.003,0.0011,0.0002,0.001,0.0286,0.0006,0.0011,0.0019,0.0795,0.0006,0.0034,0.0079,0.0004,0.0023,0.0015,0.0045,0.0016,0.002,0.0013,0.0015,0.002,0.0006,0.004,0.002,0.0073,0.002,2.4456,0.0012,4.8062,3.244,0.412,3.3672,3.2725,1.5229,1.7978,0.1362,1.7396,5.3978,0.3078,2.3905,4.8512,4.3995,2.0364,0.266,2.2365,4.235,4.6252,2.9175,0.6903,4.9797,0.1486,3.6281,2.1909,4.8033,3.33,5.0464,2.7129,0.0001,0.1112,1.5188,4.5934,2.151,1.4173,1.3112,1.1057,0.1806,1.9019,5.541,1.848,6.9827,2.9255,6.4583,0.0353,4.5641,4.2586,4.9365,3.656,4.2188,4.0823,1.1042,2.6972,2.6958,4.0598,2.2252,5.1311,1.0688,5.1776,2.1996,3.4757,5.7236,1.6372,5.0388,0.0808,2.1025,5.5945,3.4695,2.2614,2.5277,3.6561,3.3862,4.7941,5.6505,3.9896,0.0589,4.415,4.7669,4.3935,0.4218,1.0604,0.0001,5.0065,0.194,7.2576,3.0079,0.0483,0.3619,0.1686,0.0051,0.0009,0.0085,0.0152,0.0003,0.0066,0.0039,0.0025,0.0009,0.0003,0.0015,0.0523,0.0006,0.0015,0.001,0.0493,0.0006,0.003,0.0036,0.0006,0.0033,0.0014,0.0053,7.1206,0.0017,0.0016,0.0008,0.0004,0.0005,0.0024,0.0009,0.0057,0.0017,0.9341,0.0003,0.0252,0.0026,0.0025,0.0011,0.0045,0.0026,0.0002,0.001,0.0029,0.0023,0.0012,0.002,0.0046,0.0001,0.0035,0.0,0.0057,0.0052,0.0089,0.0012,0.0008,0.0055,0.0018,0.0087,0.0022,0.0006,0.0014,0.0017,0.0001,0.0004,0.0012,0.0028,0.0066,0.0202,0.003,0.0009,0.0001,0.0017,0.0026,0.0062,0.0021,0.0197,0.0039,0.0001,0.0013,0.0023,0.0069,0.0004,0.0001,0.0,0.0309,0.0009,0.0004,0.0004,0.0004,0.0008,0.0016,0.0017,0.0014,0.0013,0.0004,0.0191,0.0025,0.0286,0.0007,0.0028,0.005,0.0007,0.0026,0.0115,0.0004,0.0047,0.0056,0.0083,0.0016,0.0014,0.0129,0.001,0.0055,0.001,4.9985,1.4834,3.6473,0.5345,5.3525,4.6375,3.0205,0.0209,1.7833,4.3564,0.023,6.0967,0.6718,2.7553,2.5153,3.7909,1.0154,4.4356,1.7908,4.4176,5.3878,0.4256,2.4546,5.581,2.7328,0.1095,2.2189,0.2584,4.4052,5.9002,1.095,0.7033,0.0002,0.4287,1.4814,1.9665,4.0726,1.9853,2.5594,1.1657,4.9827,0.2062,5.2023,3.3661,1.0704,3.5176,0.6977,2.4958,2.0501,0.8347,0.0002,1.673,5.7432,5.2251,3.8913,2.0295,5.193,3.6174,2.2839,0.2323,5.2078,0.236,5.3833,3.2008,4.3983,0.9708,4.3778,4.1316,3.3783,3.6606,4.5344,2.8859,3.5242,1.0845,4.2723,4.8438,1.3864,3.6526,2.1863,1.5478,4.8338,5.7198,0.3182,0.4782,5.3738,0.0296,3.8587,0.0064,4.7544,1.0418,5.5891,0.1039,2.8458,5.1235,3.0999,1.9439,2.4891,0.5518,4.1451,2.4364,2.6198,0.3993,1.1867,1.4513,1.7461,2.1714,1.8511,5.0202,3.7239,0.5449,3.2475,1.4794,4.4065,1.7444,0.1132,0.0497,1.7701,1.1026,0.6355,3.288,0.3948,1.4985,5.0071,3.9756,0.1032,2.6577,0.0953,4.6345,1.6937,1.2737,2.8491,4.5878,0.0124,5.0611,3.5311,0.5006,1.2927,1.11,2.5747,2.7018,3.0084,1.4776,5.3309,2.2774,1.0112,3.6063,1.0933,1.8391,1.4081,2.0639,1.5775,0.9488,4.355,1.618,4.6991,0.8767,0.1066]}

They are tied 17 \u2013 17 on hard @ - @ courts and 4 \u2013 4 on clay while Djokovic has played over 30 times in the top five times in the past 6 months\n\nDjokovic has played over 30 times in the top five times in the past 6 months\n\nIt is hard to put into words what it has been like for players like Djokovic. Now Djokovic's contract is up and he is on the $900 million US Tennis contract. This contract will allow him to reach the $1 million mark for the next season with the added financial benefit of being able to play better tennis with better preparation. He will also have to work with a team such as Chaves which include Chris Algieri, Andy Murray and Mark Sampras.\n\nIt has also been suggested that Djokovic was also an easy target for the new US Tennis deal, considering the history between the two tennis giants, with their recent success.\n\nBut what has been really amazing about some of the positive things about this time period for Djokovic is how well things have worked out so far for him in his tenure as a professional tennis player.\n\nTo start with there were no upsets against the old US Tennis team. His opponent, Roger Federer, fell on the head of a Russian defender when he took a penalty and his team were forced to go 3-1 after a 4-2 defeat. The same happened over the two days against Nadal that the game would end. That was a huge disappointment to Djokovic and will only become even harder as his career continues to get off to a very rough start as he has gone 6-7 on ATP World Tour.\n\n\"We have been at the top a little bit and have not won a grand tour in six years. The most important thing is we have won three in a row and that time will come,\" said Djokovic. \"But it is just a matter of getting stronger and with the new system going into this, we can keep winning games. I think we are winning at the right tempo. We are at a good level and the big advantage is that we have a good tennis team.

{"id":872,"ended":false,"length":434,"gen_text":"The cathedral has had perhaps a dozen organs over the course of its history. The earliest is mentioned in a report written to the king of Spain in 1530. Few details survive of the church's early worship in the cathedral since those churches were only the fourth to be built around it. In 1608, a church was built in the city, and a further ten years later a church was built on the land adjoining that.\nThe earliest known church of the Cathedral is said to have been established before 1635 in the house of Gertrude Lagermann of Trier, but no mention has already been made of being built in that time. (For more details see http:\/\/www.theacademy.net\/ ). Although the oldest extant church appears to date back to 500 AD, one of the last churches to be found in the city was built in the 17th century in the town of Ruhr. In 1609, during the reigns of the new Emperor John II, it was placed there by the bishop of Ruhr. It was called the \"Garden Palace\".\nWhile Ruhr was not a great city at that time, there was not as much activity in the early church as today. Several of the early churches were very crowded, often with people in wheelchairs and others with broken glass. The streets were so congested with people that there were no pedestrians around. This forced the development of a street circuit, and at the same time made it very difficult for any resident to enter the main church, even at the height of the Gothic period. The building of the church would soon cease.\nIt is not known what caused the abandonment; it is said that, by a combination of a lack of work on the ground, a failure of the church with an inability to maintain a constant flow of visitors, a lack of money, and a lack of dedicated space, the church had to be removed. However, the church remains there, and there will be a dedicated statue of St. Christopher (see http:\/\/www.theacademy.net\/ ) during the restoration project. Other important pieces of decoration include, among others: the \"Walking-Worship Statue,\" \"Walking of the Archsperson's Statue,\" and \"The Tower of the Cross\", and also the \"Church of Theodosius.\"","token_len":479,"entropy":[11.524,2.8904,4.5717,9.1637,3.9247,1.6123,11.3039,6.3327,0.1164,3.9879,0.0007,0.9936,0.9718,1.1964,2.0067,4.674,3.588,6.748,0.5921,2.2636,5.2115,2.8374,3.5555,0.7989,3.4112,1.1908,3.5449,1.4898,2.0441,4.4699,1.2725,9.2236,3.7485,5.5969,1.6728,0.8824,4.0731,0.905,3.7152,4.9769,3.3805,1.4866,2.734,6.3684,5.2258,6.255,0.6145,4.5699,4.8188,5.0902,2.267,0.6874,0.7575,4.8428,1.9974,0.363,3.0811,2.579,4.2153,0.6807,2.2925,2.5696,1.0771,0.4511,1.2705,0.9002,3.1673,2.6195,2.0718,2.6745,4.4827,4.0855,1.3904,0.2261,1.8771,0.8577,0.2557,0.3496,2.1393,0.6115,5.1003,4.2141,4.8442,1.6727,1.6003,5.5752,3.6988,1.8101,1.8104,2.6628,0.7097,2.8879,2.5367,4.2459,0.0182,0.4366,0.2629,5.4924,6.3885,2.0497,4.4345,2.4493,1.0442,5.9615,0.1166,5.3325,3.0725,0.0363,0.0278,8.5209,9.2754,1.4314,3.1325,4.4075,1.9247,1.0073,4.3634,3.1956,3.3941,1.9233,6.6078,0.0345,0.1177,0.0997,8.4137,0.6771,1.8891,2.3876,2.9177,0.3003,5.2636,4.8377,1.9217,2.2296,1.443,4.6293,0.0004,0.4657,0.0009,3.9065,4.6356,1.0999,0.3019,0.6638,3.1789,0.0846,6.7389,5.5731,1.2466,5.0338,3.814,0.6582,5.4475,0.0859,3.2597,1.0173,0.2181,5.9499,2.397,0.2174,5.4614,1.4844,0.4836,5.7326,2.919,1.7436,0.4591,4.5519,0.9496,0.9887,1.2193,0.8845,0.8288,0.753,1.7008,3.1907,0.3519,0.0593,2.6885,0.614,2.9324,0.043,4.5276,3.4199,0.6179,1.0493,2.7995,1.8412,3.9371,0.6549,6.3332,0.5188,1.1024,3.572,0.0071,1.8499,5.6309,2.3317,5.3899,1.8727,0.9745,3.6061,0.1251,4.7155,4.7869,1.1741,1.0234,4.2224,0.2403,2.0974,0.2005,0.0109,0.9335,2.5621,0.7651,4.7343,1.0087,2.1982,4.6427,3.0108,5.9565,2.5815,1.3954,5.4089,5.2392,0.02,0.0064,1.2218,3.131,1.5014,3.723,0.4437,3.1985,1.5962,0.046,0.1295,3.3475,1.7479,4.9571,4.2761,0.1593,2.6793,0.9363,0.5851,4.2286,1.3816,1.6215,3.5878,0.3805,5.8091,2.4847,0.17,3.0961,0.7897,0.9527,4.7109,5.3518,1.0139,4.5457,1.4529,2.8357,3.2818,3.5956,0.0295,1.9321,4.0682,2.478,4.0099,4.4514,0.8517,1.6966,5.755,0.4262,4.3942,3.3422,0.0004,3.7714,0.7144,0.3967,2.883,1.0565,2.1715,4.7286,3.6024,1.2243,3.9634,5.3289,0.8921,5.3875,0.0272,1.4175,5.0092,5.4993,1.9419,2.2881,4.2303,1.5448,0.9639,0.0011,3.5098,0.6914,2.6944,0.5573,0.4739,3.6119,5.2235,0.341,2.3475,0.6602,5.2036,1.4055,2.8099,3.6644,3.0967,1.7611,2.6645,0.0202,0.664,4.2763,2.7244,0.1592,1.9045,3.6297,0.8817,1.0457,1.7907,5.1379,4.4158,5.4153,3.0749,1.0363,3.9838,0.9409,2.6702,0.7709,2.2139,2.1325,0.3905,3.5764,5.9248,1.9528,1.1941,3.091,0.395,4.7854,4.3399,3.7521,2.262,0.0028,3.1878,1.394,0.0021,4.7955,2.8801,0.248,2.6795,0.9851,2.5326,5.0455,0.9267,0.925,2.6599,5.4785,4.3955,3.9246,0.2217,2.8365,2.0508,3.8641,1.6543,0.0587,1.6078,0.4898,2.9237,1.1362,0.0024,3.9004,0.8458,0.4696,1.4426,0.8567,0.0028,5.397,3.127,0.5786,0.6569,1.2018,2.7992,0.3902,0.232,4.0316,0.8251,3.2845,0.0476,1.6714,1.797,3.2511,3.1631,1.5138,0.7393,2.8475,5.1602,0.5868,1.3605,4.0569,4.5566,0.9581,3.1702,0.5587,5.7407,3.5434,3.9699,2.0938,0.0003,0.3422,0.0008,1.328,0.0822,0.0021,0.0019,0.0006,0.0047,0.0379,2.3943,5.9541,0.4659,2.7076,3.3439,0.56,6.5138,2.8586,4.3822,0.2108,5.5819,2.2579,5.2765,2.4468,0.5503,2.0529,2.0636,3.7845,4.8349,3.6659,4.7158,5.1595,1.5942,6.1734,3.5494,4.0782,3.4783,1.269,4.4334,0.5685,5.7772,6.169,0.6448,4.1877,3.7393,0.3483,0.8123,1.5541,1.7245,5.0973,0.3223,1.2493,3.3459,3.2451,2.885,3.2876,1.0947,0.764,4.3044,1.0271,5.5762,3.4833,1.2707,0.094,2.6767]}

The studio said the script is set in Paris and that it is not a sequel or a spinoff, since \"it is a completely different Bond universe from that of any previous incarnation\".\n\nWith the release of the film being marked another development for director James Feige, with the director also returning to direct The Sixth Sense's James Bond franchise franchise.\n\nIn an interview with Variety, Feige confirmed the upcoming sequel to The Sixth Sense made some changes.\n\n\"I think there might be some changes in this version of The Sixth Sense about James Bond as it's set in Paris,\" Feige said. \"To me, there might be a different way of doing this series instead of writing some sequels. I also wanted (the film) to feel different then I did the original. At the same time, the character of Bond is so huge, so iconic and so compelling that it's a perfect fit.\"\n\nIn the series finale, James Bond meets a man named Ray, who wants to get into his brother's life, but the two are in love after he dies and only Ray has a chance to kill him. When James is in danger, Ray helps James fight the Man-Who-Lived, a terrorist who is responsible for assassinating Bond. Although the two remain faithful, they often meet different people.\n\n\"We tried to set James Bond at the bottom of the circle where he's so important, when you are going down this street by yourself for a hundred days, living your life over and over,\" Feige said. \"There's absolutely something about Ray that you feel very privileged and connected to. I am absolutely thrilled about this, you're not going to see James Bond on The Seventh Sense again.\"","token_len":479,"entropy":[7.6439,4.3056,4.3277,1.4409,0.5055,7.3078,0.3717,4.6851,1.6537,4.7688,5.1265,8.3148,7.3751,2.1894,0.3531,8.5843,1.1157,0.5503,1.7321,0.5855,7.7233,0.2793,9.3472,4.5336,0.8084,2.6538,1.4428,4.9888,0.0256,4.1618,3.0133,0.4616,0.8675,1.1058,1.8334,0.4345,0.8649,0.0004,3.4736,0.0902,4.9072,3.4891,2.5712,0.2972,1.5418,1.541,1.5746,0.0011,5.1072,8.3237,4.9125,1.5464,4.8714,0.1949,5.7056,3.1707,6.0111,0.0752,2.2199,3.7547,0.7476,1.3536,0.864,0.9937,0.0004,5.186,3.2672,0.0255,2.5041,2.7274,4.8836,0.0635,7.3747,1.9579,0.7248,3.2173,1.0198,1.568,1.368,3.3822,3.7391,0.4362,2.1875,1.2132,3.7457,0.1131,2.1307,4.467,3.3216,0.1316,3.8416,4.827,2.3501,0.0015,0.0095,0.472,4.4785,1.9529,2.0784,4.0679,0.008,3.9728,0.013,0.8624,4.449,2.0467,0.4345,2.6509,4.1138,4.524,5.1399,6.7514,2.2488,5.1226,3.6106,1.6061,4.196,2.3696,1.6901,1.1633,1.5038,0.5004,0.5211,4.006,2.5828,1.2106,3.6703,3.7573,3.8276,2.5039,1.6959,2.1454,4.2139,1.1133,5.551,1.1922,2.5306,1.1721,1.4923,2.0991,2.3674,2.8688,3.6373,1.3999,3.4479,1.0536,2.5883,5.7653,3.8218,1.157,1.4591,1.8787,3.9155,0.3296,4.4005,3.3173,2.8267,3.0965,0.6855,5.8184,1.6595,5.0345,1.552,0.2729,0.0003,5.6946,1.5992,2.4438,0.0612,1.1067,2.2515,4.0965,5.6959,6.1609,4.5268,0.6043,3.1865,1.3622,5.7075,0.1008,0.4172,4.3999,1.4551,2.5954,3.7327,4.2759,0.3913,2.2496,2.2118,2.271,0.0036,4.7218,5.925,0.0376,3.5495,6.4217,1.1565,0.719,0.0003,3.5439,2.4012,0.2342,0.1686,3.1761,0.6417,1.1273,0.0004,2.8704,2.2177,4.6459,2.6579,1.7434,1.0674,0.5945,0.0022,6.331,4.4426,1.4104,2.8557,1.0539,0.0001,0.3115,1.5119,1.7263,2.9613,5.3986,0.3766,1.2422,1.7751,2.0243,3.1392,3.0592,1.0242,1.047,0.0772,0.0037,5.9082,3.8239,0.1101,3.9566,3.2814,1.4978,2.6715,0.2654,0.7364,1.1849,1.269,0.0011,0.378,0.1884,0.2129,6.2235,1.9811,0.567,2.9928,3.019,0.2522,1.4082,2.8963,3.1242,0.678,1.7249,1.9151,5.6071,6.3545,0.0767,5.9285,4.164,3.3689,1.6018,1.7602,4.6763,4.1837,7.6829,1.5916,1.9663,0.2619,0.0832,3.1004,2.1761,6.7714,3.1153,0.9153,1.8077,1.8843,1.7429,5.7633,0.3844,0.5136,0.004,0.1968,2.7925,4.3597,1.0338,2.1037,1.1383,3.3743,6.2818,1.6695,1.0438,2.4784,1.781,0.3186,4.6475,1.9859,1.3777,0.9742,2.644,4.2635,0.5594,2.3967,0.1575,0.0002,3.4268,1.9249,5.7009,1.4377,0.4979,2.4458,0.1778,3.2747,2.1843,3.8062,1.0769,5.2559,2.3541,0.6368,4.4777,0.2535,4.1567,3.8734,2.7205,4.9339,0.2154,3.0914,2.116,1.3205,3.3985,1.8343,2.088,4.1459,3.1741,3.9254,2.9715,3.1926,2.4343,5.4704,3.3922,2.6483,1.8483,1.991,0.4069,4.7853,0.6107,0.2891,3.9323,1.9026,3.2213,3.7111,3.2526,0.5407,0.6756,5.3725,1.1045,4.4168,2.6298,3.9669,3.1973,4.0201,0.0028,0.142,0.0161,1.3653,2.3123,4.5776,1.6293,1.9668,3.6942,0.0015,5.0162,0.0171,1.8775,0.6516,6.1078,2.0454,2.9085,5.0239,5.5894,1.2893,1.9355,5.6317,4.169,6.017,0.8426,1.6862,0.3522,0.0002,2.5468,2.5338,4.587,0.2455,4.82,3.0886,0.6292,4.4729,1.0513,5.1059,0.2509,0.4142,5.5457,4.6828,0.6979,1.6866,4.0413,2.2962,1.6718,5.4536,3.2456,3.7097,4.33,2.7056,2.4504,4.8347,5.7824,0.9739,5.6196,1.7859,6.0137,3.5806,1.4389,6.1341,2.5662,0.1467,6.3846,0.9623,0.0267,2.039,0.2199,0.0013,0.3012,0.1132,0.257,3.474,1.0216,6.6541,3.0763,1.8146,2.9644,1.0907,3.3051,3.6213,3.1231,4.5627,3.7126,3.7295,0.208,0.9903,2.1976,4.8599,3.4104,1.5629,2.9489,1.9264,3.0878,6.1979,3.4816,2.8718,1.5867,0.2091,1.889,3.6661,0.3459,2.7616,3.4896,4.9534,0.0528,3.8066,1.4122]}

{"id":1006,"ended":true,"length":427,"gen_text":"As one of the most recognisable British television advertisements of 2006, noitulovE was one of two commercials ( the other being Sony's Balls ) to feature in a \u00a3 200M campaign launched by the 'Nordic' brand. The ad was featured in the opening teaser, featuring a shot of a woman holding a small white bag and saying to the camera: \"We have a couple of hundred thousand viewers but there are hundreds of thousand more on this side of the Atlantic\". During the game day of the campaign, three people were reported dead and 10 were injured. Noviette-Stojven was the first to claim that noir was an American-themed anime set in the USA. This fact would later become notorious on television as it was shown during Eurovision 2006. A few of Noviette-Stojven's ads were still advertised in Japan while another one was in China. One of Mr. Noviette-Stojven's commercials, showing a woman holding what appears to be a plastic bag, became a household item following the show's second season finale.\n\nMr. Noviette-Stojven is a television host and voice announcer on the British channel BT Sport. He is one of the most successful broadcasters in the business. From 2002 to 2004, he was named to one of the 10 highest profile broadcasters in the world by the Financial Times. In 2003, he hosted a \"Basketball League Game\" in The UK and appeared in a documentary on the life of the sport's current coach in 2005. In June 2007, as Noviette-Stojven was taking part in a \"The Life and Legacy of Britain\" broadcast on Sky, he was announced as Sports Personality of the Year. He received a Lifetime Achievement Award in April this year.\n\nAs the TV broadcast of his 'The Life & Legacy of Britain' gave him a new nickname, 'Vicki', he often referred to himself as one of the best British broadcasters ever. In 2009, during the same year where the TV aired 'The Life and Legacy of Britain', he made an appearance at an MTV Video Music Awards ceremony at London's Fashion Park where he stood in front of the audience with three women and gave the audience a moment of silence. The performance won the MTV Video Music Award and was seen by more than 50 million people worldwide.","token_len":479,"entropy":[5.4146,1.3522,0.6006,2.2338,7.647,0.027,5.0911,5.5188,8.4989,1.7989,6.5936,0.1954,7.963,11.2082,13.2488,8.2146,14.2953,3.4237,3.457,0.0252,5.4438,2.9781,5.5018,8.8509,0.2269,0.3923,9.257,0.403,13.1191,3.9575,2.2177,1.5069,4.6885,2.5586,6.4877,11.9793,6.5356,6.0112,5.3668,0.7651,1.4801,5.622,5.0326,3.1647,0.1313,2.4515,3.3718,1.1944,1.9489,3.1046,1.6525,4.5134,1.1559,1.3806,4.2802,5.0942,3.4599,4.2903,1.4118,6.4255,0.0614,1.5143,3.9077,3.0725,0.5362,4.4305,5.3139,2.898,2.877,3.8321,3.746,1.6099,0.9793,1.1267,0.8279,3.2979,2.8191,2.16,5.7006,0.3241,4.0462,2.9205,5.1679,5.2704,4.0489,1.3084,4.9698,0.3889,3.406,2.1735,2.8747,3.2906,4.1442,0.2848,0.2942,1.7099,1.552,6.2411,0.4491,5.7273,4.3451,3.2025,0.6522,2.6266,0.3803,5.8893,3.56,0.9896,4.5203,2.6729,1.6445,5.0337,2.0972,0.353,0.7548,10.5982,8.1014,1.4418,4.8307,5.139,4.3423,6.8706,2.8066,2.5228,1.5118,1.8293,3.6626,1.9956,4.5373,5.1212,1.1475,3.4455,3.3756,2.9339,3.1961,6.138,5.6066,0.2873,1.2923,3.7799,0.8679,4.5182,5.9347,4.6231,2.2917,2.1077,5.7134,3.8453,3.1968,2.5709,2.4925,0.908,2.2127,3.0021,6.1333,0.644,3.4178,1.2764,3.8644,3.244,3.5966,4.2725,0.0061,0.002,0.0976,0.0093,0.0013,0.0027,0.0164,3.4801,1.297,5.2756,5.8817,1.6156,4.5848,5.9397,3.709,2.7081,1.0936,3.1429,4.7941,0.5538,4.1473,0.7372,7.5582,1.7014,3.0059,0.008,0.0041,0.0764,0.0122,0.0018,0.0016,0.0064,2.2136,2.4943,4.4918,0.9157,2.6204,1.4178,6.9036,1.3942,0.0017,0.0105,0.2492,4.2299,0.299,0.7688,4.398,1.292,4.6616,3.6475,4.8623,0.8228,5.0039,0.7049,4.5036,0.9404,4.1927,0.6312,2.1748,0.0784,3.2772,0.0597,0.5421,0.0032,0.0079,0.011,0.0111,0.0025,0.0012,3.0808,2.3346,6.2507,3.3762,1.2814,5.9051,7.8459,3.3454,1.4858,3.1007,4.3516,5.4668,2.0952,0.6954,0.8786,1.4445,3.6478,0.0147,0.6469,1.604,2.5554,3.2794,0.8083,0.7139,2.9431,1.1897,6.3455,3.8109,0.4835,2.1227,0.6488,0.3605,1.051,3.9614,3.1051,4.7683,0.043,0.4314,4.0476,3.5017,5.1385,2.6756,0.7501,0.5094,1.3029,1.6665,1.5101,4.0042,0.0056,0.8343,2.0665,3.0055,0.3852,0.3235,4.2985,1.864,5.1632,4.7444,4.9768,5.2799,4.4567,1.7924,1.6086,5.6829,4.582,2.2199,4.3791,1.267,1.5769,2.8324,1.4991,1.2097,5.5642,0.4666,2.3298,4.0893,0.5132,4.8174,4.6192,4.8412,5.0033,0.1496,1.5888,4.3805,1.9476,0.1659,5.5125,8.2124,0.0238,0.0041,0.0362,0.0135,0.0037,0.0016,1.1377,4.5804,1.6515,0.0204,1.3131,4.3626,5.5572,5.833,1.5143,4.3318,0.1082,6.0749,2.4948,3.5128,1.5661,3.2441,1.859,0.7103,1.065,5.3965,0.2775,6.3909,0.9062,0.0754,0.0323,0.0799,1.0258,1.8033,4.3184,1.3298,3.3401,0.0782,0.1131,1.6034,5.9061,5.3492,0.0022,0.7438,0.9796,0.0002,5.1424,2.4773,5.169,4.9878,1.4844,3.1202,4.6355,1.7289,0.4118,3.7398,0.0421,0.0125,0.0097,0.0251,5.8652,1.3841,1.3051,3.6803,5.1237,0.6205,2.9852,4.0686,5.0205,0.379,1.4494,1.2582,5.613,2.765,0.0156,0.7832,0.2381,4.5943,0.0552,0.3095,3.4995,3.4299,2.2963,3.4894,0.3026,2.1773,3.5711,0.2249,4.8526,1.214,5.0371,2.1808,4.8952,2.1258,3.0933,5.2473,1.9667,0.9001,0.5958,1.2154,0.0122,0.0044,0.0116,0.6841,0.9967,4.1638,2.0134,0.3398,3.4162,2.9595,4.4771,1.4261,0.0422,0.0606,3.3093,3.6227,3.2707,0.1024,5.0836,4.3503,2.9091,0.261,5.7267,1.8361,1.2065,0.0069,1.7371,2.2188,2.5231,5.31,4.6292,2.3807,4.4146,2.513,1.9674,0.7035,4.5207,0.6748,0.402,0.7825,2.9689,5.6727,5.5565,2.0185,2.7799,0.3146,0.0208,0.7737,2.1239,1.7479,4.8106,0.5473,2.6084,0.0094,3.4006,0.5903,0.4794,1.8467,0.2276]}
{"id":2634,"ended":true,"length":436,"gen_text":"The Paralympic games were designed to emphasize the participants'athletic achievements and not their disability. Recent games have emphasized that these games are about ability and not disability. The movement has grown in popularity since the Olympics in 2009. The Games are also viewed with strong suspicion by disability community leaders. In November 2011, a group of Canadian Paralympic football players led by Canadian Paralympic soccer players launched a Facebook page with millions of views. The community said they supported the group and its leaders. The team is hoping to bring attention to what they have called 'a small but growing disability issue' and the social media network has taken note. The Facebook page will feature many people who were offended by the Paralympic games on various social media platforms. \"I do see a lot of people coming through to our online community now. I know what a large percentage of people care about the Paralympics,\" said Rhea Riggott, a former member of the Canadian Paralympic and Paralympic Committee. As part of their Facebook page they created an image to show Paralympica fans standing during the games, with a banner pointing to the Paralympic flag being seen holding the Paralympic flag as it flies. \"We know what kind of athletes and fans there are. We know they respect the Paralympic torch,\" Riggott told CBC News. \"What's great about the way the Paralympics are being presented is that we have kids who go to see them. That's really positive.\" Riggott said it makes sense that most people could be impacted as they watched the Paralympic games. \"The Paralympic games can be a little more of a learning experience for children if they have trouble walking and can't play sports properly,\" Riggott said. \"I think we have to be more mindful when watching television and in the movies which people can be affected by that if they do not go to the games. I don't think that that's an issue because there will be people going. The Paralympics have been getting so many comments from children saying that they understand their disabilities.\" Canadian Paralympic football fans have said that they will continue to protest until the Paralympics starts. Canada's Paralympic teams will have a match with South Africa during July 7 in Vancouver, while South Africa will play in Vancouver on Saturday.","token_len":480,"entropy":[13.1139,0.0212,0.4954,4.8132,3.3589,4.9242,0.5397,6.2652,0.8741,8.199,0.1886,18.6271,4.5083,0.2195,5.1199,1.3108,4.1029,1.985,4.774,0.7864,8.4117,5.612,1.1561,4.5981,2.807,4.4509,2.3056,1.0813,3.486,7.6435,1.5793,1.585,1.1694,0.4645,2.5213,8.0232,2.8074,4.744,1.8948,0.6293,2.6469,0.7382,3.2755,1.9979,3.7005,1.0159,2.3044,2.8559,2.211,3.3289,5.5291,2.9462,5.576,2.968,1.2608,2.9105,5.5376,2.4834,1.2494,2.8256,4.5306,2.4524,0.2383,2.268,2.246,0.1878,5.4016,0.9341,0.0017,0.4819,4.9498,1.0485,4.5805,0.4879,3.5729,1.5007,0.0022,0.1572,3.7344,2.2095,5.296,0.472,3.8085,1.1934,3.5805,6.1484,0.0776,1.3636,0.8465,1.3651,5.3761,5.524,2.2315,4.4217,0.4433,4.4427,1.9703,2.9021,5.374,1.0844,1.7615,4.6586,3.6354,4.5663,0.4455,4.2239,4.0279,0.0518,4.9846,1.0238,3.9649,0.9658,4.5851,3.5872,5.8022,1.7436,1.0649,2.7592,2.2384,1.7276,1.9,3.0345,5.6546,0.2571,5.6147,1.4683,4.6503,4.7225,0.4513,1.9722,3.7556,0.2729,4.4096,3.1002,4.6542,4.2715,1.4774,4.1955,5.0042,0.35,0.3875,2.0168,0.0002,0.2452,1.1027,4.2969,5.845,0.4294,0.1908,0.7342,0.666,3.3032,2.2514,4.6218,4.5086,1.4879,1.829,0.0444,1.3277,3.6111,4.3348,2.6223,4.0764,5.3587,1.6328,5.6867,2.4295,1.622,3.6971,4.5376,3.2205,5.5237,2.6119,0.0919,1.0783,6.3447,0.0427,3.76,0.6843,0.0004,1.5802,1.4202,0.7204,5.5028,4.9821,4.8129,4.9344,3.2053,0.3265,1.4587,3.1822,2.7306,0.0151,0.2556,2.1856,0.1813,0.0012,0.0706,5.6674,0.566,0.1842,0.0717,2.1158,0.8183,5.8488,2.3577,0.0009,2.5445,2.9542,0.349,3.3797,4.4858,2.3606,2.2674,3.7625,2.0279,4.529,0.0015,6.1577,2.8743,4.9111,6.0752,0.3117,1.1522,2.4357,2.9398,1.9455,4.0716,5.5829,0.5377,0.9243,2.1025,0.0005,0.3061,3.4299,5.1526,3.3017,5.89,0.9248,1.7596,0.0006,0.0881,0.5402,4.303,1.9229,1.5007,2.1209,1.5307,1.9689,4.3471,2.9135,4.5227,0.0019,3.0145,3.2481,4.3301,3.4383,0.038,1.4729,0.8233,1.2062,2.8607,5.2663,1.3539,0.691,0.0005,0.2619,6.4242,1.5066,1.5764,0.0017,0.0005,3.4064,0.9399,0.2673,0.2906,1.4618,4.2654,2.443,4.4329,0.6534,1.2492,7.1949,1.6562,0.2494,0.0003,1.3277,1.4329,1.1571,2.4873,1.0343,0.5905,2.2119,2.0866,6.0225,1.7969,4.6818,1.0543,2.708,1.4931,2.0828,3.4613,0.4448,3.1592,4.0188,1.4241,2.4635,0.0119,0.0006,0.6288,3.2339,4.5922,0.616,1.2742,5.5696,1.4651,5.0856,2.6622,6.0635,5.4715,2.2503,5.5139,0.353,0.4402,0.0002,0.2707,0.2624,0.7082,0.6992,2.8371,0.8409,0.0005,0.3715,1.1329,4.39,0.6548,1.763,3.1534,3.6587,3.8945,0.3031,4.6551,0.0746,0.9716,2.8333,5.4251,0.8144,2.6632,5.3054,4.58,2.3388,3.8004,0.15,4.858,2.8355,4.4168,0.9966,1.7505,0.0004,0.0005,0.1083,0.0351,0.7637,2.3598,0.8502,3.081,2.3536,0.7998,1.8037,2.7449,1.7956,4.1585,3.2767,5.4611,1.3988,4.1475,1.7734,3.4011,5.9068,3.5917,2.3146,1.6832,1.3392,0.4363,4.6307,4.6462,0.2257,4.379,1.3593,4.6031,0.6208,0.9389,1.1272,1.5961,2.0335,2.9075,0.0007,0.3901,1.6887,4.2449,0.9752,3.2379,0.739,3.9999,2.4351,4.5264,0.4091,2.0007,4.7944,5.6078,3.2615,1.0763,0.0004,1.8551,2.3552,1.4043,5.4839,4.2496,3.0059,3.6107,2.3131,3.0611,3.3803,1.5056,0.7887,5.5976,3.6046,1.4776,2.528,5.5694,0.2299,0.0007,0.0768,2.2942,3.8898,1.9443,4.2857,1.0974,1.0071,2.9821,2.8382,0.1416,4.0211,5.6319,0.5567,0.4209,0.0003,1.5946,5.4163,0.9181,5.6693,0.9859,0.3869,0.0005,0.0759,2.9946,2.2603,4.0737,1.7672,4.7835,3.296,3.5558,0.3029,4.7812,5.8133,3.1904,2.6782,3.2815,1.3429,3.9209,2.6148,0.1288,0.8983,0.6756,2.5066,2.9557,0.5838,3.2252,1.3886]}

No offer from him was ever made.\n\nHe's been the face of Cardiff City since 2010, and was one of the first members of the club to sign on for the final season of the contract with Cardiff. A \u00a310.0m deal from \u00a39m to \u00a316m for the following season allowed the Gunners to pick up some decent assets, including a top-four finish in the Premier League and a new contract worth \u00a312m, and there's no doubt he's the most interesting \u00a320m player in his generation.\n\nTFC fans might be excited to hear he'll be part of a new coaching department for some time. Given how big of a team he has, that means there might be a good case to hope for a little bit more in the transfer market which will see him move to the wing.\n\nWith the current squad already assembled, there are a number of potential avenues for players to return to life. Harry Houdini will leave Chelsea to join Newcastle at \u00a310m, James Van Persie will look to sign a one-year-deal and Jack Wilshere has also made it clear he's unlikely to sign a new term at White Hart Lane.\n\nAs noted above I won't include any information about a new manager yet in this article which was done simply as a guide to what is being said. No one's yet suggested a new manager has taken over the club yet so it's interesting to consider whether the transfer market for new-engageers is going to be wide open by any chance. However, I'll have something to say, because I've got a bit more detail on what the current managers are saying at the time.\n\nYou can listen to the interview on BBC Radio 5 live on Thursday 8th October from 5pm Eastern.","token_len":480,"entropy":[11.3941,3.5442,6.7759,0.9149,3.9,8.3495,16.1134,8.0941,5.5624,7.8918,4.7162,3.476,2.1481,7.5731,4.1355,1.3861,0.9449,9.4119,8.7116,3.02,10.874,3.62,2.5748,9.2149,7.7245,4.7927,0.9532,4.6129,5.7927,3.7891,3.6075,3.0542,5.6726,0.0559,3.2965,2.7518,5.3068,1.9856,3.976,4.887,2.31,2.992,4.5754,4.1901,0.8243,0.4754,5.9901,4.0375,1.3422,3.3555,0.3681,6.6998,2.5819,1.3818,0.3682,1.3673,1.0444,0.836,0.6904,1.9758,0.2136,0.4915,0.5386,0.6138,1.5875,0.1538,0.3671,1.8969,0.1554,0.3708,0.524,0.6604,0.7342,1.306,0.1794,0.292,0.4124,0.5269,0.6169,1.269,0.1735,0.2322,0.3304,1.6774,0.1544,0.2196,0.3323,0.4604,0.5762,1.1246,0.1444,0.1962,0.2846,0.427,0.5543,1.0562,0.1233,2.5339,0.0796,2.6253,0.076,0.2045,7.9502,5.4592,5.0642,4.4906,0.0868,2.1498,0.0179,1.2091,5.1961,5.9239,3.2708,3.4517,2.2343,1.8987,1.7934,1.0338,1.7782,0.0376,3.8487,3.292,2.3365,3.8981,3.2836,0.1008,2.3236,2.7986,1.3465,3.326,1.4173,1.8695,2.7313,3.0327,0.0157,0.3807,2.7184,4.4737,0.0895,0.4336,1.862,0.9233,3.1697,2.8142,1.6674,1.3896,5.4841,1.5152,0.6849,1.4388,2.0586,2.866,1.4592,1.5024,4.4666,4.4007,2.6916,2.2305,5.5505,0.1283,1.9138,2.9283,4.7332,2.7185,0.8462,2.4461,0.4741,5.0457,0.1379,2.7898,1.4807,3.419,0.6766,5.2898,2.466,5.1755,0.0016,0.2573,5.5405,0.1102,3.5545,3.4111,4.9356,1.7679,1.7852,1.7533,4.0987,1.4122,1.1222,1.3388,1.7232,0.6094,1.2456,0.008,1.9065,1.2718,4.5729,2.6047,2.4912,0.5121,3.2368,0.4278,2.8058,2.0646,5.2902,1.3404,1.1116,1.2783,1.5904,1.3744,3.1229,1.9895,4.4686,6.0137,2.7846,0.1012,2.2348,1.2458,5.9267,4.0684,0.4272,0.5566,0.0002,5.8389,5.3283,4.0602,3.5709,1.3769,4.22,0.8045,1.2138,2.4365,2.6548,0.9847,3.836,0.0014,1.3531,1.3794,5.4404,6.1389,3.1743,5.0445,0.2212,1.9556,5.5043,2.9923,3.7776,1.6858,0.2306,4.1919,1.0143,2.3926,1.226,3.3327,4.2839,2.4213,3.468,0.205,1.1739,3.2056,3.7466,0.8509,5.698,1.6339,1.4674,4.9419,1.8714,0.817,3.2667,1.6259,2.4508,0.462,6.7893,2.6899,2.5931,1.0751,3.1515,1.1372,1.7763,4.6148,1.4049,0.9493,0.0001,4.3155,2.0243,3.908,2.3118,3.775,4.8415,0.81,2.0768,2.5226,1.721,1.2647,0.0153,3.3682,5.392,1.0571,4.5111,0.5641,4.4855,0.4406,6.2148,1.7531,5.8283,7.0052,0.2523,0.0189,2.9932,4.9061,4.2962,2.1942,0.8965,4.5451,4.354,2.0639,2.4101,0.3897,1.1709,5.7569,5.5685,0.7342,0.0,1.1201,5.6426,0.2378,2.2786,1.0301,5.0691,0.1363,0.078,6.1172,0.0337,4.1543,5.0485,0.3029,0.0002,0.0,3.0051,3.8573,2.9198,2.8864,0.1875,0.3477,2.041,6.055,0.0238,2.6187,0.922,0.3747,7.3639,1.3548,3.6537,0.0001,0.0031,0.6769,0.6492,0.0001,4.4396,6.3162,1.4284,6.6448,5.3334,0.0014,4.4704,1.7252,5.8947,1.2824,4.4198,2.156,2.6882,4.9737,4.3049,1.19,0.6851,4.913,4.0156,4.7016,5.9369,3.0036,0.5776,3.6559,1.1249,2.3971,3.9344,4.0379,1.7411,1.4228,5.5805,2.5851,3.4976,4.1572,5.2085,1.8557,1.0212,0.9744,2.598,3.5022,0.8022,1.51,1.1551,2.7738,3.021,1.9498,0.6263,5.1462,0.1482,4.5411,2.8752,2.3942,4.2507,0.4243,3.346,2.8031,5.5379,5.3263,1.7162,5.2471,1.0558,3.6143,0.1473,0.8434,4.8168,0.2458,5.0624,5.3187,2.8622,0.3654,5.0174,0.422,2.1898,2.4309,4.2492,5.7239,0.3995,0.5731,4.6194,3.8736,1.1936,2.2348,3.0187,1.3427,3.1895,1.3379,4.8686,2.0726,2.5846,2.556,3.45,4.3842,1.1831,2.6998,4.3331,1.0314,3.6702,1.2296,0.2765,0.0002,5.3627,0.5379,3.7022,0.0584,0.9982,1.6508,2.3552,2.2236,0.0938,1.5582,0.1191,1.1452,2.4951,4.0752,0.998,2.4601,3.7245,3.1513,1.1351,5.5443,1.1901]}

{"id":4177,"ended":true,"length":465,"gen_text":"The ground floor houses a 300 @ - @ seat auditorium which also serves as a reading space when not in use for performances. Library CEO Judith Hare stated that the space would complement the staff's work in the library department to provide library access. The space will be located in the library office. Dr. Koonowski added:\n\nWe are glad to have the space as part of the building's development. It is an opportunity for us to add more library space and make it a more active setting for the library and the community, and allow us to offer that. With the exception of the meeting rooms, there are no public library offices located inside of the building. There are a variety of libraries on the ground floor for students, volunteers, employees, and community members. We will continue to work to meet those needs. We also expect the auditorium to cater to the needs of our community as well as the needs of our visitors. There will also be some offices and a new office located within the building, so there is more space here and the building will also have a large variety of rooms for all of those needs. It is our desire in this development to be a welcoming space for visitors to explore and to enjoy our history and experiences. Our new location will have a very unique look and feel where the library will serve the various needs of the community which will further extend the community.\n\nThe building is currently being built and will remain there through the 2019 academic year. This is the second time in recent years that a building in this name was added. The building is currently scheduled to open in Fall 2018. The project has been in the works for about seven months, but the company has yet to finalize its final bid. The building is expected to cost around $200 million and this is expected to include at least one floor, a large auditorium to accommodate the collection of books and a new space for the library.\n\nThe development will also feature the building's own separate entrance (the first step towards the future of the building where the building will be built), as well as a second, larger, upper level that provides access to the building's administrative, library, and other offices at night.\n\nOn March 23rd, The New York Times will publish an article with an explanation about the project, which includes some of the details of The building's development.","token_len":480,"entropy":[8.3222,2.5064,7.2056,1.489,7.7715,12.5939,8.1985,5.1004,7.7497,9.714,0.0029,5.0257,4.3583,3.3151,0.2591,0.9937,6.7487,3.1288,7.0396,3.9888,0.574,0.0199,3.4206,6.011,0.7174,9.193,10.2369,8.8275,9.8392,6.7714,1.1771,1.1813,3.3239,4.1632,6.324,0.6393,5.8703,1.3351,3.4974,2.1994,1.2805,2.5867,4.9753,3.5749,2.242,5.0753,4.3754,1.7036,2.2288,2.8756,1.5935,1.4951,3.5009,1.3432,0.6072,3.154,3.7826,2.836,6.183,0.316,4.9591,5.6527,5.4294,3.6788,3.0488,2.7468,0.0063,2.6944,1.291,5.5795,0.5937,1.474,1.6062,1.7291,2.9552,3.3872,0.0005,1.0934,4.1704,1.1406,3.5582,1.1607,1.811,1.5627,2.2097,2.7874,0.6598,1.558,0.0878,4.1974,1.8736,3.6815,1.0653,1.9738,3.9905,1.1688,1.6654,1.6557,3.7955,5.9779,0.4752,1.9563,1.2021,2.3415,1.7967,1.4069,3.6348,1.7397,5.3785,2.518,0.0828,3.7459,4.7919,3.1334,5.195,0.9465,5.755,0.0047,1.2238,5.8525,1.9623,0.5848,2.9048,1.5131,0.7327,4.1437,3.0483,3.08,2.7774,4.0215,1.9786,0.3437,0.2776,0.4256,3.8613,0.8741,3.0088,3.1823,0.0024,3.7672,3.5946,0.7959,2.4453,0.0244,5.4464,3.7545,1.3932,4.7924,0.5773,5.1949,0.6456,0.9186,4.123,0.3385,1.0131,1.9849,2.7022,1.8902,0.0943,1.7542,2.1668,4.7823,3.1199,0.0953,1.1705,2.2875,3.3404,4.0636,1.8273,5.118,0.0016,0.4261,5.6612,0.4473,1.4446,0.6457,0.0243,1.8089,1.9166,2.9003,0.1416,0.6735,1.4397,2.6159,0.0175,1.1562,4.5131,0.417,4.7423,0.98,1.3251,0.0183,4.0942,5.4996,3.0362,2.5652,4.428,2.3283,3.6716,3.1465,0.2407,0.3956,2.988,2.924,3.012,1.347,3.0611,0.8806,5.6863,3.398,3.322,2.2929,0.6857,3.3137,1.8749,1.3755,4.6948,4.7209,0.0133,3.7241,1.2455,3.9325,1.7924,3.4902,1.279,0.1963,3.9209,1.0752,2.9139,4.0879,5.8049,1.7875,2.9943,0.5452,3.4684,1.6859,2.6563,1.7375,0.3931,4.4014,1.8014,3.9655,1.5864,2.4452,2.8493,1.6112,4.8541,1.0542,5.4645,0.5172,3.8896,4.6677,3.2659,0.9311,4.1497,1.2084,4.1138,3.3186,2.0577,0.8805,0.4567,6.1143,1.881,1.0708,2.0357,3.3214,3.4327,6.0958,1.8176,0.2708,0.8435,0.8938,6.0313,1.437,4.2875,5.6539,0.8665,4.0044,2.6521,0.8511,0.0004,1.8595,2.3932,1.6126,2.3714,1.5585,2.9511,2.8659,1.6679,3.2592,2.8607,2.7623,0.7706,4.1915,4.2939,0.0484,0.2945,4.4998,1.9758,1.8942,1.5552,1.1642,1.4335,3.6429,0.732,0.2079,1.8464,1.5636,2.5313,3.3903,5.4364,3.6064,3.5552,2.3333,1.4808,2.072,2.0694,1.7809,3.9451,0.1998,1.4699,0.6751,5.1661,1.1262,0.4495,2.5321,3.6928,2.1741,0.7556,2.2445,0.4187,0.213,0.3594,3.0367,4.0203,1.5845,1.9414,1.822,2.0087,4.4084,1.4859,2.5504,0.0031,2.5348,0.0077,2.4168,2.7615,4.7423,0.5207,2.1015,2.1485,1.3449,1.949,0.0056,3.0479,2.6264,0.0612,3.4891,0.5256,2.0657,6.0451,1.3309,1.8054,0.0084,3.3505,5.5493,0.0041,2.0935,3.8321,2.5829,2.6552,3.1489,2.5049,0.0007,4.0323,2.6079,1.6738,5.0164,1.0395,1.712,0.9175,2.3373,2.6937,4.6091,0.7627,1.4584,1.3796,0.8882,0.947,0.0002,1.999,4.8458,2.2989,1.8932,3.1619,2.6334,3.7463,0.2341,2.7357,5.9331,4.2256,5.2012,3.0441,3.743,4.4565,2.2885,1.2611,3.4727,0.8021,0.4608,0.507,6.7495,1.4471,1.3418,0.7592,0.9667,2.7329,1.492,2.078,0.0316,0.0098,1.0593,3.593,2.533,2.2597,1.7803,5.7066,0.867,2.9986,5.6854,1.6205,0.1913,0.5539,2.9504,0.7038,5.6457,4.1579,2.019,0.7965,0.7368,3.525,1.442,5.6938,5.3503,0.3102,0.9976,0.0002,5.6644,3.4469,3.378,0.7304,0.245,3.8936,2.7994,0.2138,0.1421,4.4445,1.4342,1.214,0.4395,3.289,2.5306,4.6142,2.9635,0.4711,1.5727,1.9413,1.7353,3.3765,3.4366,1.4843,0.1294,1.8792,1.3874,5.6615,3.8226,1.3289,1.7444,1.033]}
{"id":2185,"ended":true,"length":422,"gen_text":"Since common starlings eat insect pests such as wireworms, they are considered beneficial in northern Eurasia, and this was one of the reasons given for introducing the birds elsewhere. Around 25 million species are known to have been encountered between 1995 and 2006, and the average species size for eastern and western Eurasia has quadrupled from around 100 to 800.\nAnthropogenic nature of the new species is also recognised. In 2004, researchers from the Italian Institute for Integrative Biology (IITBs) established a subspecies in the group B. sturreschi (Lepridia amelipsatis) that was able to fight parasites by feeding on the larvae of insects using an herbicide. The larvae of the parasitic lupineus are less likely to survive than those of normal larvae.\nThe study of the new species has important consequences, particularly for the study of the diversity and distribution of vertebrate hosts in the Great Plains region. The new species is able to overcome the low survival rate of other species, and there is a high proportion of the Great Plains region biodiversity, so some of the ecological challenges of living in the Great Plains region are in line with the natural limits of species.\nThe new species was a direct result of the work carried out by researchers at the IITBs in South Australia where they developed one of the most comprehensive conservation programs which will see species raised at the start of next year.\nThe study is based on an international collaboration established by the IITBs, led by IITB researchers at the University of British Columbia, and at the National Museum of Natural History in New York. The findings were reported in a paper due next month in the journal Current Biology.\nMore data and information will be needed by the end of 2018 on the populations of parasitic lupineus and lupineus caterpillars in the Great Plains region in order to better understand their ecological niche and the nature of the Great Plains. At this stage, research on the different types of lupineus or lupineus caterpillars, and their biology, are still ongoing.\nTo date, we have managed to isolate the parasite bovine lupineus from one of the populations of the parasite caterpillar in the Great Plains region of North America. The research has been published in a recent issue of the journal Proceedings of The Royal Society B.","token_len":482,"entropy":[8.7173,11.6045,4.4168,5.5102,6.9644,4.7421,2.5986,0.0012,10.3513,1.3829,0.4965,6.349,1.7817,4.3619,6.1912,2.9756,8.8595,5.8739,0.2116,1.559,2.4704,5.1202,4.506,4.1065,0.1822,0.1732,1.3475,5.6997,0.5129,5.0752,1.3097,5.3774,8.2449,0.6793,7.4518,4.5093,1.6759,3.0048,2.547,1.6377,0.5286,1.7073,0.5784,5.2994,4.3867,4.0574,0.0992,3.0311,1.1906,1.2315,2.0278,4.192,4.384,1.8137,2.4747,5.6748,1.9649,1.102,0.9495,0.1028,1.7279,6.0461,0.0036,2.3079,2.8568,3.3635,1.3371,4.3764,1.8888,1.1423,15.999,2.6844,1.9967,5.7135,0.6469,1.4966,6.0292,1.2317,2.2309,2.6018,4.42,2.0949,2.9567,5.3807,0.476,2.8606,1.3931,0.5969,6.0741,2.4888,1.5523,4.4537,0.1956,1.4101,1.312,0.5715,1.5749,6.1453,0.1502,5.3737,0.969,5.9375,0.1947,3.2484,0.9186,5.5659,5.0456,2.878,5.6224,4.7517,5.6121,6.3837,2.8432,3.8411,3.5776,5.1466,1.6699,5.1749,2.8758,5.2956,6.2166,0.996,1.6782,1.958,3.512,0.0063,4.8634,4.485,2.5456,3.0072,0.2552,2.3949,2.1679,0.571,3.5891,5.9998,3.253,4.9163,0.1691,0.777,1.7748,3.7662,1.3654,1.1639,4.1272,5.1977,0.902,3.9097,4.7854,3.0402,5.4274,2.3705,0.0125,2.8079,2.6122,1.9646,0.2714,3.7135,2.2704,1.7269,1.1407,1.6496,3.5543,2.892,1.1723,1.19,0.3991,2.796,4.1034,4.5694,3.5461,3.055,0.681,1.2034,3.7137,0.0169,1.9332,5.1518,2.2307,2.7968,0.0272,5.6061,0.5815,4.2173,1.59,0.8867,5.5131,2.6825,1.3738,0.6683,1.7956,2.1231,0.2036,1.4523,4.1386,0.0113,5.2761,1.4474,5.5837,3.5582,0.9619,0.482,1.9068,1.268,1.8323,1.794,5.1084,0.6163,1.1826,3.1759,3.9964,0.0262,3.3139,5.3305,0.0032,2.615,5.002,2.4373,3.5516,5.23,1.3265,0.5301,4.558,3.4316,2.171,4.7935,0.5564,0.8773,1.0641,0.0013,0.5777,1.1636,4.7329,2.8839,0.0089,1.1032,4.7168,4.1733,0.3229,2.8719,2.4141,0.7906,1.545,2.0337,0.1733,2.8144,4.4926,4.1588,0.7623,0.0073,1.1898,3.1388,1.8973,0.0017,0.5692,3.9053,1.2514,0.73,0.7493,0.008,0.171,1.6494,5.5886,3.6206,6.1555,1.2798,3.9538,6.2891,0.212,0.0686,1.751,1.8077,3.9184,3.5582,6.8229,4.3885,4.2633,4.197,4.4189,3.8359,1.4992,5.5862,0.0165,2.1928,0.2028,0.5286,1.312,1.6231,2.2583,2.2648,2.5072,0.0704,3.6213,2.474,1.3893,6.5041,0.8631,0.5961,1.1826,0.0117,0.1419,2.0147,3.932,0.0089,4.4395,0.0698,0.368,5.1752,3.1159,0.6929,1.3917,0.0136,4.9429,0.0023,1.4167,1.6923,4.9474,0.4426,3.7198,2.0758,0.2017,0.5513,0.0395,0.9273,1.63,0.2212,0.9547,1.4356,5.2782,1.9695,3.3222,0.3141,2.3768,1.1576,6.1256,4.3446,1.1197,0.3916,0.4248,0.574,3.791,0.0558,0.1431,0.5247,5.9223,5.2108,2.8742,1.7538,2.9829,0.0886,5.2429,5.1757,0.77,2.0099,0.0008,4.6003,3.9836,0.523,5.2456,0.249,6.3296,0.4749,0.0112,0.5608,0.0285,1.1367,4.3662,0.0955,0.5815,0.9517,3.9093,0.0318,0.0006,1.2012,0.3091,0.2193,0.0008,0.2313,3.6885,0.6738,0.0172,1.4766,0.1836,1.3991,3.2614,2.2511,0.9436,2.3083,5.2644,0.1043,1.3692,2.1261,0.0016,2.4596,6.7262,1.8845,1.1608,0.5588,4.243,2.0817,0.6667,4.6975,2.5969,0.0955,1.4799,0.0059,0.088,0.0192,5.7056,0.8454,0.0028,0.0058,0.0164,0.1823,0.0106,0.0084,3.6786,1.9187,1.2652,4.8495,0.7814,2.1247,1.3002,2.0225,0.3186,0.8202,4.5121,3.1533,0.1295,4.054,0.2257,4.8109,0.1902,4.4425,1.6857,3.8815,6.0258,1.3712,0.1782,2.8785,0.0183,0.0728,0.0227,1.1059,4.984,0.6091,0.3446,5.3588,0.6554,1.7619,4.7367,2.7573,0.8576,2.2139,0.8818,0.4588,0.0008,0.3581,2.9123,3.9582,0.0953,0.7221,1.6508,3.9094,2.5235,1.6926,2.4955,0.2389,3.0738,3.0344,0.4181,0.036,0.7762,0.8537,3.3505,0.006,5.6991,0.439,0.0154,0.0652,0.2688]}
{"id":2381,"ended":true,"length":464,"gen_text":"According to Collider.com, HBO is meeting with Snyder to discuss a potential Watchmen TV series. = = Legacy = = A critical and commercial success, Watchmen is highly regarded in the comics community and its success in its current year marks major development on the show.\n\nThe fact is Nolan and Marvel has been working together on Watchmen for a long time to ensure they're not a part of the same show that took over.\n\nWatchmen has had its fair share of problems thus far - a big one being the failed attempts to get it to air on multiple screens. With the exception of the original Watchmen, the series has never really been renewed (it was cancelled in 2009). This could have a very positive effect for HBO as it is the only major network producing the series at that point - one of the last on TV before a spinoff shows up in a big way in 2016.\n\nAs the Walking Dead creator told Entertainment Weekly, \"It looks like it got canceled after what we called it, and there's so much drama and the ending, but at the end of the day it won't happen again. It was meant to be a television show and when it was canceled - as it already was - it was too long, it was too messy, there were no real characters, and the way to give the characters some depth was, it was so long!\"\n\nNolan then revealed that the Walking Dead is actually coming back - the character was never on the show's schedule, due to the lack of episodes for two reasons. First, that the series would also never be renewed. While the series was supposed to come back at least again, that would mean the series would be scrapped - and, then, there would not be any characters on the show in the fourth season, but with time at the TV studio, it was possible the show would be revived.\n\nAccording to Collider, the reason why fans are curious about what Snyder's plans are on television is because there will not be any return of the same character anytime soon. \"Honestly, when you are going through this, you can't really tell. I think it's a big, big deal that the show is going to die,\" the veteran comic book artist told Collider.\n\nWhat do you guys think about the possibility of a reboot of Watchmen?

In the season before Nash arrived, the Suns had recorded a 29-17 record in that span and played in just six of the team's 18 home contests because of injuries and struggles. Nash did not play until Jan. 25, when the Suns moved to the new home of Taj Gibson. In the opening two days of the season Nash had been playing his first game. He suffered a broken finger in the first game and he missed most of the second and third contests. He was also in the All-Star game against the Memphis Grizzlies on Feb. 28 but missed most of the rest of the game on a strained hand. Nash returned to court with a bruised left shoulder on Feb. 24 but played well later on. As a result of the injury Nash played the first five games in the regular season but missed three straight after starting the next five games. He played the last seven games against the Nuggets, where there was a 15-6 record.\n\nNash finished his career with 11 double-doubles. He had 7 in 20 games in which he played on the wings and in a backup role with the Suns.\n\nNash was 4-1 in his last 24 games where he didn't play. When asked if he could play two more games with the Suns, Nash said he would. \"That's just an opportunity to go forward and try to find something that I can do the same way over and over again.\"\n\nIn the game against the Pacers on Jan. 29 Nash played the eighth and final game at Oracle Arena he did not play the final game before leaving the season, then went to the All-Star game on Feb. 28. Nash said that after playing through his injuries his body looked better and in the right ways in that final game of that season. Although, he took a year off from basketball practice to go under the covers, Nash said that when he returned to the NBA after that year and played his second season with Phoenix, it took some time for him to recover. Nash said he feels more confident playing with the Suns after the All-Star break.\n\nNash played in all 50 regular season games with Phoenix.

David Lynch and Dennis Hopper won a Los Angeles City Writers' Guild Award for Best Storyteller. David Lynch won the prestigious Silverman Literary Award for Best Independent Writer. David Lynch and Christopher Michael Lynch, co-star of The Twin Peaks franchise, also contributed to the 2004 Sundance\u00ae Best Picture honors.\n\n\nLynch and Jojo Johnson received nominations for three awards, and each received 10 nominations each, for their roles on these films, and the four new titles, the 2001 The Hurt Locker: Best Storyteller, and the 2003 The Invisible Woman, came out for their final season of the NBC sitcom. Lynch also won a Golden Globe for directing this series.\n\n\nLynch, Johnson and Johnson's four original scripts for the 1997 feature documentary were selected for an Academy Award nomination, but were unable to advance to the Academy Awards. Lynch and Johnson, along with Warner Bros. and Showtime Films, released a statement about their collaboration: \"This film is part of a larger effort to help make television a more vibrant, engaging, and accessible place where people, like us, can enjoy each other's company.\"\n\n\nLynch and Johnson's new television series is set near the end of the 1960s (the year the first show premiered) but is centered on a woman, Amy Armstrong, who has been missing for 18 years. Her daughter Annie Lynch and her husband, Chuck Lorre, were filming at the time. As the series develops, it will premiere each fall and culminate at Cannes next month.\n\n\nIn February 2001, Lynch directed the film \"Sharknado: The Sequel to Joaquin Phoenix and the Legendary Legend,\" an adaptation of his autobiography, which was released in 2002. The film stars as a young young woman named Joaquin Phoenix, who's pursued vengeance on a serial murderer led by the mysterious (but not immortal) killer of her younger days. He's also playing an ex-girlfriend who may be his best friend for life. The film also stars James Marsden, John C. Reilly, and Daniel Dae Kim.\n\n\nStarring Chris O'Donoghue (The Hurt Locker) as Amy Armstrong, the new series is directed by Amy Hennigan.","token_len":483,"entropy":[6.5814,3.8604,7.0508,0.6279,1.7003,5.4141,3.3365,1.4143,1.1674,2.6171,1.3791,2.2461,8.1561,4.9609,0.9518,0.0837,0.0243,2.2633,2.7045,7.1143,2.6125,0.1193,0.3686,1.9177,5.3286,4.4307,2.1603,1.6442,7.4802,0.8902,6.5215,2.2585,3.3033,7.1906,0.273,0.0038,1.5684,2.6515,6.8031,0.0208,5.239,4.1349,2.2441,1.1681,0.5474,0.1711,0.5665,5.4553,1.4012,0.0172,1.4777,4.9057,0.2601,1.9796,1.638,6.0226,4.8091,4.5201,5.4001,0.2166,0.3097,0.8351,4.9778,1.6946,1.2598,4.0228,0.0532,2.1857,5.6411,6.275,4.4368,4.2631,2.6639,0.0262,1.8734,1.9099,2.0803,4.6861,0.2008,3.0509,0.1714,2.8511,5.0877,0.4395,0.5599,5.7517,4.6355,0.0004,7.7495,2.0744,0.9056,4.536,0.3306,3.1318,0.0004,3.507,0.0006,2.6889,6.3023,4.9955,4.2661,4.5957,2.5894,0.2119,4.1457,2.8794,1.7894,3.7131,4.1419,1.3223,5.5572,1.4913,3.227,2.2748,1.886,1.4298,2.6286,3.5158,5.2392,1.1815,2.7255,1.8497,2.587,5.5434,5.4358,4.0816,3.1816,3.8672,5.1476,4.7709,4.9693,0.0018,0.0002,2.4479,5.6235,5.0837,0.6242,0.0109,0.4857,2.0925,1.3498,2.8313,2.247,5.5383,1.9834,2.0775,6.7084,1.3155,4.435,1.9484,5.2068,4.4601,1.531,1.6664,5.1726,2.4031,0.5447,2.8288,2.6388,1.1833,1.6817,1.7348,0.0355,1.206,3.1349,3.9938,3.5641,1.5164,1.0072,0.0004,1.2537,0.0013,2.4581,1.097,1.2437,3.6943,2.6677,5.2625,4.18,4.0595,1.2075,1.4843,5.1494,3.6631,5.4164,3.9596,3.7688,0.913,3.5586,2.4295,0.0795,1.9305,2.0013,4.0851,1.9106,4.8347,0.0105,4.3452,1.0117,0.3612,2.475,0.0865,1.1701,3.2934,1.422,0.2373,3.1402,1.4682,0.0002,5.8606,0.3289,0.623,1.9804,4.7693,4.2886,0.5045,3.6395,1.8074,2.9147,2.7935,1.6344,5.7843,1.1732,0.6913,3.4372,2.5978,1.2627,5.4038,0.0534,0.8744,2.7279,2.859,0.6087,4.6274,3.3274,4.5834,1.7856,1.0187,4.1318,1.3343,2.4317,1.1266,0.4618,3.5254,1.1898,3.007,1.356,3.9866,4.6797,0.6632,0.033,0.3754,4.1953,4.3691,0.0434,0.3415,0.6384,1.8374,0.7317,0.0004,1.3327,0.0014,1.0861,0.1733,1.7806,3.0769,3.3105,0.4708,2.7641,1.9259,7.4997,0.7342,1.0211,0.0023,0.617,5.1549,0.0229,5.8439,1.8999,2.5017,1.9043,2.4748,5.0877,1.1989,1.4099,3.7851,2.1153,3.8554,0.7503,1.1134,3.8637,2.7607,5.5163,5.4017,0.3653,0.3534,2.3783,1.5334,3.6808,0.7586,4.7544,0.3055,0.6124,3.3621,3.9375,5.9903,6.6926,2.7809,0.4998,1.6595,1.2703,5.3528,4.823,0.0009,0.1475,3.0902,4.7998,3.1046,0.7003,0.4222,1.0695,4.2783,1.4959,1.5662,4.7752,0.1771,2.7126,0.6022,5.0397,5.5863,4.4205,2.7978,5.4657,0.0424,2.3827,5.4593,3.6898,1.3092,0.1706,0.8556,0.0003,3.0774,5.1092,3.5398,0.1003,1.6184,2.9981,1.0005,2.6625,2.2837,5.0461,3.1238,2.2661,0.0152,2.3722,1.3704,5.4158,0.0193,1.2154,6.335,1.2782,0.0016,2.7925,1.0591,5.7819,4.981,2.0185,4.0927,0.9583,0.0345,2.357,4.0454,1.4065,1.8294,1.3415,2.1117,0.4299,2.7583,0.2376,1.2256,0.9927,3.8434,5.892,1.341,1.6327,4.8487,0.9794,2.2867,3.1346,1.0046,0.2319,0.6856,0.6692,4.0434,4.5562,6.3499,1.3895,1.9561,4.2562,3.3926,6.2815,0.0113,2.4924,3.6675,5.7618,1.5825,3.5762,4.3776,0.0511,2.705,2.2871,0.9592,4.1373,7.2897,0.6416,5.0287,1.7323,2.6177,5.239,2.6601,2.8821,0.0274,1.2935,1.7914,5.4386,1.2296,3.1483,3.0346,0.0818,5.281,0.9173,0.6586,1.9429,0.9349,2.2481,0.3963,5.6279,3.1543,0.0044,0.9603,3.8296,2.5975,1.0578,0.0218,0.1316,2.2623,5.3968,4.693,0.2624,0.0925,0.4151,0.7447,0.0003,5.5747,0.0121,4.5494,4.0569,0.0362,3.903,0.159,0.0002,3.1291,1.7455,4.0735,0.0026,0.0005,2.3655,0.4287,1.6662,0.0809,0.3021,1.2916,2.406,1.0861,2.2407,1.2203,0.0293,4.7741,4.0542,1.0893,2.5832,1.941]}
{"id":4882,"ended":true,"length":450,"gen_text":"Warren signed a contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers on January 7, 2011. He was cut September 4, 2011. Warren then signed with the Detroit Lions a few days later and was cut September 20, 2011. He played in just six games (none of which came in 2010). In 2003 he hit 13 touchdown passes across 15 games.\n\nWarren's production was not as good as most other offensive linemen in those years, but he was better than many defensive linemen and had a fairly good team.\n\nWarren's second sack might have ranked among his league best. He actually finished tied for 8th in the league with 10 quarterback pressures with two sacks, with one out of the first 3 quarters of the game. He came out of the game with a knee injury the ensuing 9:46 into the game, but he took off a few more plays with the Steelers.\n\nWarren is 6'2\" and weighs in at 5'11\", 206 pounds, and came out of the 2015 Pro Day, where there was a full 4 hours of work to get dressed, so some of the physical work might have come from doing a press. I don't think that is a major issue for Warren in his second year of pro football.\n\nWe'll see if there were any improvements in his strength in the coming months. His ability to get up to 100 meters on the fast run is important to his production as well as ability to get across the 40 yard line and get to the end zone on a short run.\n\nWarren averaged 4.38 yards per carry as a rookie and 4.41 yards per carry as a pro for a team that won seven games in five seasons.\n\nWarren was sacked just 15 times in the NFL last year, but only two of them were for a touchdown pass. He hit his highest score of the season against Chicago which was his third pass of the season with 12:03 left in the third quarter.\n\nWarren was also sacked 6 times by the Chicago Bears last season during their Week 15 win over the Minnesota Vikings with no passes thrown.

In addition to films, he was one of only a handful of major actors on the show.\n\n'The American Dream' is available for pre-order now.\n\nBaldwin's production company, a part of the firm that operates the show, is owned and managed by Richard Matheson [the late Richard Adelman].\n\nMatheson and he have operated Matheson and company since 1999, and the four current members are Marc L\u00e9on and Dan Aykroyd who were also the main production company staff at the time for HBO's original series.\n\nThe movie stars Mark Ruffalo as Burt Lancaster, Michael Keaton as Mark, and J.J. Abrams as Bradley Cooper.\n\nAs part of an effort to raise money for the Oscar winner, the late actor David Ayer bought out his investment bank in October 2015 and began the business.\n\nHowever he has said that while he has no involvement with Bradley Cooper or Ayer any time in the past, he will not be taking a break from making projects based on the American dream.\n\nHe told Variety:'[Ayer] didn't want to take a vacation, which is so important to him. He had to spend five weeks working on 'American Land,' so the two of us are very excited about what we're seeing and what it brings to this world.\n\n'But as far as the actors are concerned, we're all kind of doing it at least a little bit less.'\n\nIt is not the first time that a film has gone out of timing on television after being picked up for release by HBO.\n\nBefore a season of 'The X-Files' was announced for 'Game Of Thrones' in December 2015, the show was nominated for eight Academy awards; for best animated series; for best short. The first season was nominated for three major categories including short, comedy and animation.\n\nThe final season of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine had an episode of \"Deep Space Nine\" called 'The Voyage Home' in June 2016 and was seen by some to be a surprise on television.\n\nThe show originally aired on NBC in 2007 but has since returned several times.","token_len":484,"entropy":[4.4921,2.8746,11.0507,7.2596,4.2678,0.7267,6.7335,7.4861,0.041,7.0347,3.6069,0.0042,0.173,6.1854,4.4267,0.0005,0.0003,4.7266,10.9072,3.6087,1.6716,3.6522,9.6867,0.0002,1.6168,10.5131,0.6616,0.0458,1.1641,0.0339,0.0013,0.4483,3.3011,2.8907,0.6063,7.7707,1.7228,0.8378,1.6245,5.1517,0.0209,4.508,1.9495,0.7222,0.0919,5.1519,2.172,3.622,0.7537,2.3705,2.0566,0.9277,0.0004,6.5138,2.6004,5.4295,1.2982,0.3821,2.9733,3.8626,1.5319,2.1119,0.1687,0.0315,1.3457,1.3301,1.0761,0.0003,5.2163,3.9739,0.0886,2.5951,5.4572,0.5603,0.858,6.1499,5.4917,0.9414,1.7083,5.4298,1.6301,4.9043,1.2739,2.9375,0.5097,2.2332,2.9617,3.1587,2.4732,0.0053,4.4209,5.4265,0.1711,0.0,7.1792,3.4628,3.3583,3.6126,6.2857,1.4747,1.1003,1.2818,0.0003,4.4349,0.0023,0.0007,3.2975,6.0073,1.8742,5.6942,4.7837,0.0043,0.0073,3.4048,5.2007,0.7788,3.7268,0.9815,1.5527,2.8906,6.0846,4.398,2.9351,2.3384,5.8919,4.2579,4.0882,2.6373,1.9619,5.0651,3.8044,0.0012,0.0001,0.0,6.8448,2.9015,2.6089,3.7691,4.6055,4.7924,3.19,5.0957,1.8464,0.654,0.4503,5.1401,5.1894,0.8207,3.3687,1.136,1.2586,0.382,0.0003,1.8491,5.3478,3.2535,5.4049,1.5301,0.0,0.7543,5.1571,0.7702,2.3081,0.5152,4.3134,2.2731,0.0004,0.0608,5.223,1.9373,2.9341,4.7693,0.6265,0.5466,0.0047,0.0045,0.0788,4.308,0.0379,0.4586,0.6966,0.0002,5.4246,2.4853,0.0021,4.1878,2.5663,0.0536,3.8867,0.8522,0.3222,1.3561,6.4685,5.679,0.9375,1.561,6.2289,1.5677,4.5456,2.7606,0.0642,4.6601,3.7133,2.125,5.5378,3.4359,2.4052,4.2599,2.7031,1.5346,3.525,3.548,4.1153,2.054,0.4696,0.0002,4.9935,5.287,1.9544,3.1845,1.3486,3.8442,0.6373,2.3269,1.1431,3.0367,0.9955,6.9418,0.0811,2.4423,3.5243,0.0117,5.7407,1.694,2.9361,0.7146,0.5676,0.2018,0.5655,2.2526,1.6899,0.9552,3.6119,2.4418,4.2675,0.3359,4.8033,4.9665,6.0204,0.0946,1.2939,5.0367,1.6367,0.3939,0.3277,0.0002,2.7377,1.7241,2.6845,9.9283,7.0112,2.3879,0.2558,0.6792,4.8389,0.0005,1.762,0.2858,3.063,0.981,4.171,1.8416,3.9793,0.903,5.886,1.729,1.2347,1.5111,0.8979,1.1323,3.4463,2.0982,4.4635,4.5697,2.7275,3.3561,0.3966,3.5046,1.6005,5.7194,1.0569,2.2328,3.9237,3.9472,0.3563,1.942,3.3417,2.505,4.0041,0.8026,2.8722,1.6535,0.6935,4.3067,2.9262,1.6239,3.0123,3.818,0.6917,3.0409,2.0758,0.8203,0.521,0.0004,0.3626,3.2932,4.1033,1.4986,0.0045,2.0559,4.9252,1.5694,0.002,0.1843,1.6256,0.6172,2.0975,5.8341,0.0136,3.8431,2.7726,4.3482,4.5971,2.5791,0.6582,0.1216,5.2445,3.0747,0.3247,0.0003,4.7794,0.9223,1.4627,1.5639,0.0452,0.053,1.2514,2.3946,3.1597,1.011,4.0148,2.7952,0.7108,6.5703,3.8097,3.3887,3.3659,2.1842,4.0036,0.199,1.1247,3.0641,1.8854,2.5386,0.5306,0.4312,0.0003,6.4247,4.6465,4.8667,1.0105,0.9597,1.7091,4.5751,0.0645,0.0059,0.4887,1.4435,3.0373,1.8704,3.7818,2.2726,2.716,0.0007,0.8453,1.2161,3.1483,1.602,0.1768,1.8971,2.0411,1.5991,4.8098,0.0691,4.6457,2.1015,4.742,5.7681,3.5954,0.7658,3.3905,0.4693,1.4219,0.8862,0.2168,4.2817,5.2478,3.9202,3.955,1.0145,1.6866,1.9359,0.0832,2.1951,6.0748,1.5015,2.9153,6.4665,1.3819,2.9197,1.1713,5.1842,0.4353,0.3642,0.0004,1.9265,5.0472,0.693,0.4808,6.3732,0.5806,0.7148,2.5704,0.0002,0.0005,4.2276,3.3478,2.3303,2.7862,2.9527,4.5042,0.0466,0.0355,0.7616,3.1737,0.3568,1.736,5.5868,0.0343,0.7372,0.9058,2.4673,3.6489,0.9563,2.6953,1.3245,5.4934,0.5829,3.7102,2.3453,0.5168,1.4935,4.8347,4.5705,2.9317,0.4715,0.497,0.0003,1.883,2.222,5.5961,1.3376,1.0422,2.9963,1.1052,4.1017,1.8941,3.2933,0.707,4.1768,7.7888,0.076,1.4977]}

{"id":3090,"ended":true,"length":448,"gen_text":"A mobile app was released on 10 December 2013 on Google Play, and later on iOS ; 1 : Nenokkadine's first look, posters, video promos and other promotional material were released in mid September 2014. This is the first major development on mobile apps since the mobile OS' release in September 2003. More information also was released in the previous three months to the public, including a report of major Google Play development in June.\nWith this announcement, mobile development on Android and iOS is entering the early stage. The announcement on the main Android and iOS apps includes a large list of features, such as the new Google Play services, an app store with two major features: Android Market and Google Play Store; app launcher on various services (including Google Play Store, with a Google+ app store); an online app store; mobile search with Google Play, along with Google Play Music; offline and streaming music from some apps.\nAndroid users can also use the Android app from Google Search and the Android Play Store. As part of Android 4.0, Google has taken over responsibility for updating mobile version of the Google Play store with Android 4.0, while in iOS development on mobile apps includes support for Android 4.0. Developers can install and run the latest Android 4.0 on their servers, while supporting the old version of Android. Additionally, Google has also provided the public with an information about the apps on Nexus devices, as well as their respective ROMs, as well as an app pack containing Android 6.0 and earlier versions of Android mobile operating systems, as well as information about how to install Google Play Services.\nThe main Android apps will only be available through Google Play when the Nenokkadine app is installed. The application is expected to launch in a couple of weeks for the Google Play Stores at the beginning of August. Google has not yet released any actual news as of this writing, but it may be possible to start a Google Play Store update under the Nenokkadine App Update. The first time a new Google Play app is released requires you to install the Nenokkadine app using an existing Android client; once activated it will automatically run on your new Android device when the initial Google Play update appears. In any event, if you install an older Android client you will not be charged for using Android 7.0 or later.","token_len":485,"entropy":[9.5803,2.4837,4.4691,2.7981,2.1377,6.268,2.9506,2.6309,4.5053,3.2068,0.0274,2.15,1.8766,5.4968,2.1675,2.6545,12.3515,6.8749,9.4201,6.2802,6.6453,5.343,4.764,6.2529,6.811,4.1051,3.7424,7.7646,5.0768,12.3787,0.9975,4.9108,9.5187,0.0041,1.1002,3.024,2.4452,0.8345,1.8431,1.1396,2.1911,4.7408,5.3,0.5124,0.6866,4.3305,2.5807,0.9918,0.6029,4.7453,4.5604,2.7504,2.5968,2.7464,2.018,1.5203,3.2106,3.8265,4.256,1.3965,0.6889,3.2371,5.3351,0.45,6.4689,1.4217,6.6319,2.3686,0.4524,1.7089,2.1039,5.6542,4.4733,0.7475,4.7711,2.1989,0.6801,2.2894,1.2962,2.0168,5.2819,2.355,5.915,6.1738,1.8779,4.5276,2.7285,3.2251,3.0362,1.1847,8.491,2.6586,2.8734,0.398,4.8868,3.6635,2.8419,0.7533,3.305,0.3192,2.0525,5.6589,2.4187,5.2923,2.2698,1.0297,2.1493,4.9779,4.8271,1.8533,5.2402,1.7726,2.0934,0.027,2.8301,5.0959,1.5606,4.0506,2.2576,0.0281,1.9477,1.3255,2.2026,0.0013,2.6816,3.6644,3.6133,0.7332,4.0409,0.8329,4.1671,3.0422,1.0639,3.3599,5.7525,4.0795,3.837,2.166,4.3042,2.9497,1.7959,1.8873,0.1722,1.3575,4.8047,6.2572,5.5614,4.2291,5.9631,5.2329,2.9925,2.2212,1.9548,0.274,1.2928,1.5415,5.9435,2.408,4.5166,4.8289,1.9969,2.2856,0.7348,3.6237,3.5677,2.8927,0.5334,1.6614,4.5826,3.9371,2.6725,1.6809,1.4088,2.3086,4.7247,0.001,2.948,0.8689,2.5,1.4066,5.6298,2.9635,3.9928,1.9241,2.3428,5.4426,2.8793,1.9935,1.3549,3.1062,4.756,1.5138,1.6917,2.5394,1.0529,1.9344,2.632,5.7746,1.6168,7.9782,2.3808,1.9522,1.7883,2.6406,0.5913,1.728,4.4742,2.8999,0.0008,2.8072,2.8316,0.0127,1.3182,0.7581,1.4605,2.3505,5.3769,2.8288,5.3183,0.1372,4.9387,4.7042,4.8474,0.8293,1.3301,1.7134,0.3371,2.3991,3.0344,2.1079,0.8622,0.0099,0.3154,2.0118,4.7975,3.7785,0.6396,4.1692,2.8566,2.6838,0.7168,5.4224,4.2212,0.0773,1.9843,0.723,0.0199,0.3772,1.3362,5.7467,0.8878,3.0447,2.2241,1.7006,1.486,1.9672,1.5332,2.0603,0.0036,0.0352,2.297,0.6751,6.3534,1.838,2.7837,5.4022,1.5841,4.913,1.2419,0.9352,1.0401,1.6671,4.8845,0.0651,1.7469,1.2343,3.0071,3.7224,2.9101,5.6281,0.4215,2.3579,4.4801,1.7905,0.9436,5.4469,2.7047,6.3514,0.505,1.3991,2.5623,0.2171,0.0053,3.9325,4.4361,6.0,0.2312,1.9068,2.6324,0.3326,0.0042,3.274,3.367,5.461,2.9736,2.6776,4.4742,0.0621,0.035,2.7776,3.0562,1.7284,0.7397,0.6912,7.0132,0.8405,0.2643,2.6307,1.9109,0.0699,0.0046,3.3805,0.4463,3.2968,0.5138,1.1768,3.8465,0.311,2.1338,1.3977,0.5603,2.3109,4.0363,0.8539,1.4129,3.567,5.3226,0.5407,0.3589,3.3546,0.7361,0.0549,5.1934,1.5488,5.8356,0.2982,0.0217,0.0049,0.0111,0.0041,2.4493,0.7022,1.3373,1.2561,2.0259,5.9066,1.9578,3.6309,0.0127,2.5957,0.9949,3.5871,2.4606,0.0877,0.518,3.4719,1.9306,3.3667,0.0442,4.8261,5.1994,1.7231,2.1957,0.0038,3.2545,0.8775,3.3677,1.7021,2.6595,1.536,2.0889,1.7196,5.7393,4.3657,4.0545,1.8803,1.7866,0.282,0.8595,0.5393,1.7256,3.9127,0.6462,1.5799,0.4984,3.4855,2.6689,2.2018,0.3006,0.5938,3.5995,5.9741,0.7572,1.5782,0.0084,0.005,0.001,0.0014,0.0019,2.2988,5.2055,2.3912,2.8462,4.1962,4.4334,1.987,1.3871,2.3827,0.2532,2.2318,0.4381,1.5468,6.3565,4.3064,0.1045,2.4084,0.8989,1.4975,0.0063,0.0061,0.0016,0.0009,0.002,0.6942,4.7076,2.885,2.685,1.3285,4.7705,4.8294,4.1164,5.2052,4.1188,0.5875,2.1696,3.7533,1.9533,1.3518,3.5929,0.848,0.5325,4.252,1.6797,5.7929,2.0025,0.1221,1.2189,4.9577,0.3075,3.771,4.6754,2.0928,0.0373,2.7756,0.3028,2.9181,2.6714,2.6101,1.8184,0.2797,3.4877,0.8311,2.2332,0.56,4.582,0.8049,2.8047,4.277,5.1707,0.2035,0.2165,1.6633,0.6959,0.7095]}
{"id":2833,"ended":true,"length":452,"gen_text":"As one of the largest open spaces close to Manchester, the moor has a history of use for army manoeuvres and large public gatherings. In his book The Condition of the Working Class in the North London Moor, historian John C. Dutton writes of the condition of the moor and its relation to the Manchester Moor and those towns in south-central England. The Moor describes as a major building project on the Moor the works of Samuel Butler [see 'Workers and People of the Moor' in the Moor Encyclopedia, Volume 2]. According to Dutton, Mers was demolished for the construction of the public buildings of the period (27 April 1848 to the 1858 Census) and on 9 May 1856 was turned over to a public authority. The Moor's redevelopment followed one of the last industrial regeneration projects to the north-east of Manchester, completed in 1852 by the Emancipation Proclamation. The Moor opened the doors to the world of trade and commerce with its modern architecture and its unique character created an atmosphere which has led to the present day of the moor. Mers served as a refuge for immigrants and also as a means to protect the British capital on a daily basis by establishing a network of railways linking London with Manchester. From 1840 to 1865, the moor held the record as the second largest open space (behind the Stable Place moor, the longest continuously open space in Western Europe). The open moor opened daily from 1841 to 1845 and served as a refuge in time of war. The moor's history dates back far more than just the work done to convert it into a park and lodge. It continues to survive today as a significant place of refuge for the city of Manchester and beyond, and in the early 19th century, an Moor was a key element in the redevelopment of Manchester's landscape. For a brief period in the early part of the 20th century, the Moor was part of the Moor Forest, a small network of moor houses where communities of all ethnic groups resided. In the 1890's, an architectural masterworks project using an existing site was undertaken at the site of the Moor. Today, the Moor remains an integral part of Manchester's urban architecture and landscape. A number of Moor Mors, all of them open, survive from the late 1800's until modern times. The Moor Museum is currently the world's primary educational institution.","token_len":485,"entropy":[5.4146,1.3522,0.6006,4.3833,7.2147,5.1972,10.7384,0.0841,7.8669,1.0647,1.6869,8.5626,3.1503,4.2488,2.2707,4.2406,0.302,5.7378,1.9904,10.0972,9.6102,0.0913,1.3336,6.3771,5.27,1.6849,0.5159,3.3744,5.8186,1.8868,2.2497,10.045,0.2283,1.1628,7.7015,0.6492,1.1626,2.0032,5.182,4.6683,5.8321,0.5583,2.8742,2.9576,4.7796,1.7134,4.9674,2.8651,2.3966,2.0703,0.8511,6.3356,0.2714,0.4135,2.587,0.0019,3.3429,1.364,3.9457,0.0391,0.7917,4.4564,2.1593,3.5659,6.5306,5.7878,2.7207,4.3049,1.5032,3.353,0.5576,1.519,2.5247,0.9909,6.3291,4.6409,2.0296,5.5975,5.3663,3.5059,4.2419,0.4857,2.2784,5.9198,5.9412,0.2878,5.5142,5.3326,6.5956,3.6011,4.3851,5.0345,1.5619,2.4994,5.3911,1.5639,0.9185,0.4322,1.4672,1.9427,2.3635,5.5818,4.7898,1.9087,3.2226,2.2962,2.5797,4.9715,0.0009,0.8542,0.0002,0.4329,5.1597,4.5626,2.1356,5.6605,3.8774,1.4825,2.8306,0.0297,1.2982,5.9109,3.9634,2.1509,0.9604,3.4616,3.5217,6.3303,5.0162,2.5402,3.2913,1.5716,3.9417,4.252,3.3121,4.4813,1.4319,0.8391,5.953,4.3736,1.9491,0.3036,2.9553,2.8976,4.571,1.8832,0.1292,3.6341,3.8941,2.6824,1.3286,1.4637,1.8368,2.198,5.179,5.3493,5.9829,0.2319,0.29,5.2107,5.1619,5.1581,0.8249,3.1911,2.8,1.626,1.3217,0.8209,0.3942,0.3529,1.5519,5.8076,0.4404,0.7511,4.308,1.8048,1.5069,5.5203,3.1289,0.0105,0.0032,3.3714,0.0261,0.8362,1.5521,1.9051,5.2387,3.0455,3.1199,0.936,1.1229,3.6793,1.381,5.3292,0.9312,1.24,3.7404,2.7375,4.5928,4.021,1.205,2.8446,4.9602,3.1568,7.2286,2.1907,2.6219,4.1006,2.9945,5.3989,0.2556,1.2152,4.8735,1.6691,3.8825,1.6337,2.625,0.0026,0.7499,4.1654,0.2727,5.4116,0.2631,0.7425,4.9341,0.758,4.922,1.9563,5.586,1.7337,0.3576,4.1179,2.5334,4.4729,0.756,4.9706,3.2149,5.617,2.2215,2.4733,0.0146,3.776,4.4889,1.4059,3.6859,0.0314,3.8453,3.9931,2.6016,1.2029,1.3751,0.535,4.9584,5.3195,0.4308,4.0795,0.7907,0.945,1.6773,0.0018,5.1948,2.5076,2.7859,2.1256,0.5673,4.0714,0.5354,0.6881,0.0427,4.9117,2.3352,1.4886,4.4578,6.3721,5.4717,4.0404,0.0106,2.9715,2.8958,5.5135,4.0318,1.2177,0.7737,0.5834,6.8395,1.0717,1.4545,1.6313,5.1884,2.628,0.0035,3.8072,5.311,1.1478,1.7611,4.0639,0.3832,0.7613,2.6085,1.5515,4.2305,0.2223,0.6124,2.5497,4.0825,5.1662,0.7143,1.0072,1.6423,1.6114,1.8118,0.0025,2.6337,3.5133,2.9883,0.2632,6.8143,2.6679,0.0647,3.3527,0.845,5.7957,3.4612,3.7301,5.2954,1.1694,0.552,0.3381,3.6586,1.9133,5.9725,0.6152,1.7345,5.4317,0.3642,5.0662,1.5312,1.6828,0.5796,5.085,3.7106,0.8429,3.6815,1.1405,1.8519,4.7166,2.0337,0.0282,1.4778,5.0852,2.6134,2.1721,3.8847,1.7079,4.0154,2.2422,0.0022,0.0836,2.0318,4.6126,9.8359,1.8242,3.809,3.1421,2.9604,0.6519,0.72,3.876,0.1121,2.1175,2.1631,5.602,0.3952,4.6343,3.1975,2.8875,0.9947,1.292,0.3172,1.7567,4.0909,0.0008,0.0548,0.6484,0.0005,0.0528,0.1974,0.8224,1.267,0.9787,3.6127,0.0125,0.594,5.475,6.9938,1.674,1.311,4.301,5.8223,0.0424,2.9613,0.0646,4.9567,5.2118,5.9942,1.312,1.56,4.0227,1.7884,3.366,0.7589,2.3425,1.4112,4.375,2.7539,0.4012,4.1146,5.5328,4.0097,4.6799,1.4237,6.0402,3.7284,4.1319,4.1528,1.893,2.7533,3.0015,0.8182,1.1176,0.8443,0.4043,1.159,1.981,5.2514,0.4271,0.8478,0.8447,3.3131,1.9926,2.3351,0.0668,0.0079,2.0173,0.3156,2.432,4.1187,1.2047,3.5848,0.6811,3.7201,2.886,0.0023,3.0608,5.4221,1.6848,3.3608,5.3772,1.3735,1.5246,4.3407,1.7646,6.2244,4.2039,0.5303,2.6064,2.6155,0.5769,1.8799,4.6285,0.743,0.2828,1.529,1.6163,3.6167,1.9498,3.6483,2.8974,3.0101,0.1105,6.6253,3.4306,0.9191,1.3781]}

{"id":1862,"ended":true,"length":456,"gen_text":"By discharge, the Missouri is the ninth largest river of the United States, after the Mississippi, St. Lawrence, Ohio, Columbia, Niagara, Yukon, Detroit, and St. Clair.\n\nIt was in the year 1810 that the United States declared war on England because of the invasion of England from the north, although it has never actually fought a war anywhere in the world. When America entered the war with Britain on June 10, 1790, its forces outnumbered England and Britain 4 to 1.\n\nIn the second quarter of 1865, Missouri became the first state to declare war on the United States. The U.S. government continued to use the Missouri River to fight the Great War; on July 1, 1865, Colonel Henry \"Dick\" Lee, one of Missouri's leading military officers, made a treaty with the Missouri to hold its own battle in Missouri, to prevent military incursions into this little state without violating its sovereignty. The Treaty established some important diplomatic and political obligations, which had been maintained, however, since 1812 and the Great War had been fought so many times that the Missouri remained a part of the Union. The treaty was also important to the Constitution of 1812 as it defined territorial limits of the country.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Missouri became a member of the United States Parliament after the failure of the previous session to agree on an appropriation of Missouri from Washington. It became a member of the State Senate in the late 1940s despite the death of Representative Joseph P. Clark. Missouri remained a member of the Confederate Legislature at the end of the Civil War. The Missouri State Historical Society has named many names after local and federal leaders of the Confederacy during the 1780s and 1820s. The term \"war on Missouri\" is used as a synonym for both an army offensive and a militia offensive.\n\nThe Missouri River is used as a navigable river and provides water to hundreds of military units. It covers nearly one-fifth of the total area over which the United States is in a contiguous contiguous land region. It is one of the largest rivers in the United States, and makes an important navigation route over portions of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. It is about 30 miles long and 19 miles wide with an average depth of about 2,000 yards.

Coe and dedicated to the idea of protecting our coastal ecosystems in the coming century by encouraging natural resources to be used to enhance our water quality and ecosystem health for wildlife. She was instrumental in developing the Everglades Environmental Partnership, a initiative that launched into action on the opening of the first Everglades Park in Texas after the catastrophic hurricane of Hurricane Harvey.\n\nIn the coming years, she has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on environmental and conservation efforts for New Mexico and West Texas, including the restoration of wetlands along the Everglades, and the restoration of wetlands on the Gulf coast. Her work has been involved in the creation of a number of initiatives including: the restoration of wetlands on the Gulf Coast, the restoration of natural water resources in the Everglades, and the restoration of wetlands along coastal rivers from the Mississippi and Louisiana Gulf Coast. In addition, she has overseen the work of the Everglades Environmental Partnership, a federal collaboration with the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Gulf Coast Department of the Interior, the Federal Highway Administration, the Coast Guard, and the Texas Department of Natural Resources.\n\nBorn in South Carolina in 1948, Douglas grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, which was already a great success. While there, she went fishing occasionally while she watched her country fall apart. During her time in San Francisco, she visited the Everglades National Park in 1989. Douglas was involved with the development of the New Mexico Everglades, which would eventually encompass portions of New Mexico's eastern Andes Peninsula.\n\nAfter World War II, Douglas was the sole survivor of a number of wars, including the Korean War II, Laos war and the Korean War. After her retirement in 1981, Douglas resumed her conservation work on the Everglades. Since that time, she has been involved in the restoration of floodplain wetlands over the Everglades River in Wyoming where she has worked with local groups on the restoration of wetlands, watershed integrity for the past half century, and the restoration of wetlands along the Everglades river. During her lifetime, she has helped create several initiatives and was named recipient of President's Best Conservation Award, the \"Grand Prize for Conservation in the Underwater Everglade.\"","token_len":487,"entropy":[9.4018,7.8014,4.5455,0.4802,0.9861,10.8261,1.0714,0.0031,2.1783,1.5502,3.0847,0.1394,1.2852,3.1429,4.3547,4.3242,0.6044,7.1763,0.066,1.3674,4.1078,0.0077,0.0152,8.633,6.359,0.5942,7.6091,1.4803,1.8262,1.4058,3.8731,0.0133,6.5673,5.7457,0.6389,7.1952,1.5126,2.6085,7.4659,0.0334,2.6116,7.3142,0.3465,3.7135,5.0308,3.3464,2.527,4.3062,0.6551,5.3819,1.4603,3.622,5.0162,4.7203,2.8051,1.3736,0.9417,2.0861,1.8462,3.3246,2.4739,4.0855,1.3306,1.6518,4.5169,1.0463,5.6341,4.9283,1.1281,1.9613,2.0088,2.8229,0.0193,2.6564,0.6678,1.2595,0.0009,0.0195,3.8538,4.1166,1.0814,1.2612,5.7995,1.2581,5.5545,5.6185,2.0077,3.8031,1.744,5.5157,0.4862,0.8298,4.5668,0.1488,0.0007,0.0907,4.4518,0.5781,4.6931,6.273,1.3239,5.3821,4.0876,0.7315,2.7139,1.8315,1.2747,1.4095,0.0005,2.2812,2.3973,5.2582,0.6148,0.5489,2.8859,2.3932,4.5864,4.8464,0.0181,1.6719,0.0236,0.0532,1.5154,3.3063,2.1452,1.7406,1.9025,3.4867,6.7196,1.6249,1.9104,5.7734,0.2924,0.8426,2.2273,1.9901,2.4572,0.0713,1.7589,3.4806,0.2659,2.5363,0.0007,0.0055,1.246,2.7507,2.3184,1.9092,0.0313,1.9896,3.1955,0.5609,2.8297,3.2605,0.917,3.0168,1.4675,0.8486,1.5596,5.0201,0.1848,1.8753,2.7149,0.0494,2.0039,3.7464,0.0013,3.8802,2.4092,3.5137,1.7508,2.073,0.0231,1.5816,1.3814,0.3243,1.1082,0.5807,0.8555,1.0082,1.16,0.0163,4.9114,3.7521,1.7882,1.8881,0.752,0.3159,0.0007,0.002,0.453,0.8223,0.5625,1.1429,0.0307,0.8858,1.0166,6.0918,2.946,5.6227,0.9652,4.9287,4.1058,2.9872,3.1138,0.9706,1.0566,2.7298,1.0671,0.4726,0.568,0.3061,5.5158,0.9085,4.3491,0.1006,0.8355,2.2708,0.0022,0.0284,2.4855,0.7954,1.0081,1.1408,4.5996,3.898,2.6065,0.4664,2.7617,0.0946,3.6157,0.0242,0.0052,0.0004,1.2634,1.8219,5.0516,0.6739,3.4643,0.0391,1.5169,0.3067,0.2763,0.9661,4.069,3.5846,0.0064,0.2101,0.8353,5.4645,0.0466,0.2926,0.7083,0.6462,2.9445,0.8645,0.0011,1.5778,0.0091,0.3236,0.572,0.0001,4.8575,0.5259,4.9273,1.0309,1.775,4.1744,0.1378,0.0526,3.3803,0.0028,0.312,2.049,4.737,2.0075,0.2004,0.5555,1.3667,4.3271,1.6414,5.5907,1.5882,5.4874,5.5717,2.4781,4.3837,2.8728,0.3141,0.1397,4.1587,4.9364,7.0142,4.28,1.7769,4.6499,0.9681,5.925,5.9263,0.5458,0.7792,3.7932,1.2447,2.114,1.0503,2.6703,0.0085,0.1392,0.392,5.5734,1.3544,3.4,0.0007,0.0067,1.3596,0.3019,2.6974,6.0147,1.9144,4.7476,2.1658,3.9359,1.8738,0.7648,4.1123,0.0701,0.5309,4.6959,0.4891,3.3215,0.0032,0.0143,3.4441,1.4083,3.9297,1.9211,5.0373,4.4368,0.014,2.4583,0.0128,1.6823,3.3932,5.8357,0.3654,4.8227,0.983,1.6038,0.0001,2.599,4.7818,0.0011,0.0413,0.0859,0.2669,2.4711,4.4049,5.0482,2.125,0.117,1.738,5.4302,0.0024,4.468,1.5998,0.7448,0.4022,1.7547,0.0444,7.6819,0.8451,6.0234,3.9534,2.556,0.7163,2.2297,0.1172,0.4152,3.1024,2.0855,2.5481,1.6444,4.4157,0.0782,0.7965,4.8366,0.4421,3.1029,0.4927,2.8349,0.3411,0.9343,0.0002,0.003,1.3092,4.5369,2.54,0.0182,0.0535,0.2718,0.0963,1.7801,1.2097,0.3478,1.7688,1.0413,0.1595,5.7992,0.7755,2.2068,7.3097,0.6258,0.6554,0.0005,0.0019,5.0762,2.3332,5.3067,6.5169,0.7101,0.8205,1.6073,1.2582,2.7652,3.224,2.6953,1.699,0.6925,0.0458,0.9358,3.7759,4.8822,3.806,4.8044,1.8095,5.8916,4.574,0.4709,0.3509,0.6088,1.8699,0.7854,0.0226,0.6616,0.4651,0.4139,0.9783,0.0006,0.0022,4.8227,1.4372,4.3066,0.8695,3.701,0.0859,0.8463,0.1471,3.2081,3.2567,3.8247,4.2395,2.6934,4.8452,3.1378,5.8012,0.0202,7.0352,1.9624,5.806,2.3324,0.4736,2.995,1.289,4.0374,5.594,1.4309,0.979,1.1408,2.3582,1.0446,5.8455,0.3221,3.9455,0.0067,4.8052,0.6764]}

The Kolkata Ghats were formerly known as the Krishna Ghats.\n\nAerial view of Ghat at Kanpur. Credit: Deepak Thakur \/ MGNSSH As we enter into the first part of the season in June this year, I am going to get a lot excited since I will cover a lot of the areas of which there may be more to come. The Ghats, along with Rajasthan government, have come into the spotlight with the addition of several large houses and new hotels to Kanpur and the new development of the Ghats, as well as the presence of some huge shops, such as the Aseam Market, Ravaland Road, Nagpur, Tola.\n\nThis is a long list from the perspective of the entire year, based on the events of the past five years. Let's start with the new buildings to come.\n\nThe Ghats which will see a great change in view from Kanpur is the Pune Mall, just across the street from the Ghats. Just across the bridge on the Aseam Street in Karnataka is a mall that will be renovated, and is being opened up. The large building will come into immediate use next year as well as the Naxals Road mall, which will be built by a consortium of NITI Aayog and other partners.\n\nNow the big developments, such as the 'Omnibus-Chandigarh-Udupi' bridge, are yet to be seen. However, there will be a big investment going on. The MGNSSH and the UP government are looking at it as a potential project for the future. However, I think the Ghats will become a source of pride for all. The Ghats will definitely offer many new attractions, and a lot of exciting new developments. Let's stay positive, and keep working hard in our efforts to grow this country.","token_len":489,"entropy":[7.1731,7.6046,1.5504,0.0163,0.0053,8.9927,0.0707,2.0143,8.1443,0.8481,3.6269,4.821,0.6428,1.2489,2.487,5.343,0.6585,10.9096,1.9135,5.4224,0.4808,4.3692,0.3845,2.5453,1.7832,1.5351,6.6369,0.0229,0.6736,12.0069,10.6506,6.5279,5.522,3.03,1.1162,3.4444,0.4537,0.2811,4.9196,0.0177,3.5707,6.0072,0.5441,9.863,0.4621,5.3198,3.9937,0.2819,3.4397,4.2248,0.1136,0.0005,2.921,3.5399,6.0467,5.192,0.361,1.7639,1.6227,4.369,0.0586,3.1301,3.1615,5.9988,0.8663,1.4005,5.8597,7.5585,3.837,4.4662,0.9215,0.0002,2.1172,4.6592,0.5491,0.0161,1.897,1.6471,4.8137,1.156,1.3532,1.6167,4.5438,0.263,0.0006,0.0011,1.4279,2.9603,0.1169,0.0271,0.0119,1.2521,2.5705,0.3443,1.5264,5.2706,0.1387,0.0618,1.2215,0.0493,1.5361,4.8062,1.6279,0.0834,0.8715,6.089,0.8807,0.0133,1.4598,1.2929,0.0052,3.8704,4.7141,0.2786,0.1561,4.4549,4.1311,5.7778,5.5775,0.4883,2.2775,4.406,0.0374,5.8491,0.652,4.3285,0.5229,0.2518,3.4906,5.4531,3.5813,2.4437,1.5514,6.8162,4.6798,3.6103,3.3374,0.5577,3.7185,2.857,0.0082,0.7666,5.59,2.6613,4.3277,4.776,0.0715,0.0763,4.2974,1.836,2.5907,0.077,4.6319,1.795,2.7427,5.4979,7.0501,1.201,2.8374,5.616,2.366,0.6446,0.1654,2.3057,4.6718,1.763,5.9376,3.1171,5.785,0.3765,3.2767,1.9413,1.501,0.3854,2.1783,4.5811,0.0146,2.6978,2.9202,0.0383,5.2094,0.3742,0.0163,7.2069,1.8236,1.8472,4.5063,3.2666,2.2177,2.5112,3.0606,1.486,5.623,0.0134,3.9389,3.7061,4.552,1.9663,5.1269,4.0047,2.5247,4.8068,0.0017,2.5664,2.3545,4.089,4.3281,0.7985,0.7865,2.1948,0.0198,2.8709,2.6424,0.261,0.0106,1.1588,5.262,0.0379,3.9439,4.8817,4.7744,2.0856,4.5567,0.0024,1.983,5.6829,4.2057,4.8373,4.9585,0.905,5.4636,5.8583,4.7206,4.911,1.0845,5.8581,0.9452,1.68,5.6298,5.7108,3.8895,1.8145,0.0002,3.8374,1.5238,1.8379,4.4056,2.1665,5.3537,1.2665,5.7351,0.02,1.2344,4.4754,2.8379,1.3003,6.4332,0.1546,1.1906,5.7583,1.4473,0.8481,1.7781,3.43,0.5036,0.5617,4.5487,0.7304,1.4859,0.2812,0.5392,4.5148,3.6049,4.9864,2.3662,1.394,1.0948,0.0001,2.031,3.3172,0.0338,6.8467,3.287,4.6123,2.494,4.2744,3.0242,0.8955,6.3979,2.6087,4.4744,0.0065,4.6016,0.729,5.3475,1.9616,4.6354,1.1458,5.5287,3.0878,0.5076,3.4672,0.1963,0.584,2.4041,0.0207,0.7283,6.0798,1.9826,0.2596,4.6196,3.643,0.6207,4.27,0.2192,0.0125,4.1484,3.9953,6.071,0.0602,2.3456,1.7817,4.8484,2.9391,1.6267,1.5275,5.0559,2.8033,1.9127,3.5156,2.9196,4.1784,1.8738,3.1932,1.366,5.7962,2.6949,2.1295,5.1163,2.6524,6.8764,1.2895,4.4187,0.5151,2.5033,2.0303,1.0606,1.4268,5.6959,3.9491,1.8628,4.8037,4.9537,1.2783,1.0734,0.7203,1.1553,2.3245,4.1124,3.1766,2.0767,0.3988,5.458,6.3617,0.3906,0.3073,0.0239,0.0049,1.7193,4.1586,3.6457,0.4694,1.0102,0.0002,5.63,3.3891,3.7412,6.059,3.5385,2.2197,0.0019,0.4144,5.8557,6.055,5.389,1.5417,3.8174,4.3419,2.1734,0.3411,0.0219,0.0247,3.3401,4.2641,0.0819,0.0302,0.7975,5.1053,1.1462,2.0419,5.6911,0.0074,0.3499,2.8195,0.6358,3.7809,0.1648,2.6618,1.802,0.2402,1.1725,3.386,4.442,4.3133,0.7591,2.833,1.4022,5.4732,0.665,0.0051,0.0211,4.2374,1.5164,5.7156,0.5479,1.1019,3.0247,0.8412,4.0605,2.2071,0.7533,2.5079,3.5325,1.8174,1.2701,2.1785,0.6665,4.6102,0.0578,2.8543,2.231,1.7313,3.1904,0.0274,1.0544,3.7323,1.0801,4.7546,0.0366,2.6476,0.5881,2.8816,2.8229,2.323,2.4217,0.016,1.4835,5.4401,5.9293,3.9553,2.4551,2.4788,1.612,1.9232,3.151,1.4031,0.1106,5.472,2.0838,4.7722,0.8866,5.4628,0.1282,5.2358,5.7635,2.3095,1.0536,2.9177,4.1193,1.3547,3.3331,2.8721,1.4816,0.6437,4.8938,2.3672,1.82,0.5554]}

In some cases, such as at the start of Cele Goldsmith's stint, the official editor was not the same person, nor was the editor in charge. The list is generally only the most frequently requested feature because of the frequent changes that have been made to the content.\n\nAn Editors' Guide To All Of Your Characters\n\nBefore you jump into editorship, make sure you understand each of the different editors. The guide to all editors will show you each Editor's List where all of the characters and details can be found in the new Character Guide. As we said earlier, the Editors' Page is available to the general public; we would suggest you download it for free to read, with a view to adding editors in future versions or simply to post on the GamePilot forums.\n\nIf you are looking for the latest version of the Editor's list, follow the steps in the Guide to All Editors below. We will be updating the list to reflect the new Editors' List content, but have yet to give you the ability to update it in the future, or even in any way at all. In general, we encourage anyone new to the GamePilot forums to read the Guide, but you can still check out the Guide for more information through the forums.\n\nThe Guide will show you the information you will need to know about the current Editor's List, which can be found by clicking on the \"Update Editor's List\" button on the left of the main window. If that isn't clear, click on the \"Edit GamePilot\" button and it will be displayed in the top upper right corner; it will also give you access to previous Editor's List articles, but only after looking at the Editor's List pages on the GamePilot forums.\n\nAlso note that the Guide has links to additional Editor's List articles in the FAQ.\n\nIf you read the Guide well, you will know that it is a very comprehensive work in terms of the content it covers, even after having given me some good feedback during the first few days of the site. We want to share not just the guides to new editors, but the detailed information as well, so it isn't difficult to find yourself writing about the game you're playing right now.\n\nHave fun.\n\n-Eileen\n\n[Source: BoardGameGeek]","token_len":492,"entropy":[7.5999,3.8117,4.6768,1.9354,8.4064,1.6511,3.0554,7.1579,0.7479,7.1598,3.6886,4.2781,2.9765,0.2717,0.4247,4.8452,0.1078,4.9631,1.1597,3.0686,0.1454,17.4602,10.8602,5.8615,0.7364,8.0531,1.7521,1.3808,7.0552,3.7173,1.7898,2.3854,2.2236,3.2079,0.1392,2.3863,5.2154,0.8263,1.1407,2.2683,3.3377,0.8896,1.793,2.6032,1.6726,1.8287,5.6544,4.3772,3.9234,2.0507,5.5285,3.8716,4.1747,6.1132,1.653,0.8708,4.9794,2.342,2.5788,1.632,1.1794,0.0863,0.8408,0.4385,4.3566,1.172,1.1549,0.0008,5.6131,5.6331,1.0881,2.6552,3.6548,5.5737,3.2773,3.6903,3.6342,0.6948,0.0003,5.0979,0.9545,4.9634,0.8592,6.3292,2.977,0.3457,2.7013,0.0509,0.586,1.841,5.1909,0.9714,0.3602,4.4172,2.0002,2.6602,2.53,5.5442,3.0028,2.1129,2.0795,2.839,3.6564,0.1294,4.3384,5.4111,0.2089,4.7962,6.6909,2.942,0.6777,1.1625,2.3293,2.8774,4.5194,2.8371,0.0882,0.7453,2.613,0.9642,5.3257,5.1412,2.4138,0.3499,4.8942,3.9107,3.3661,2.1142,0.0919,1.8126,3.832,0.0475,6.7123,0.9966,5.5475,2.0556,3.0773,1.9901,0.0713,5.6659,3.2339,4.4067,3.0924,1.1309,3.3593,0.7932,2.4653,1.5197,2.4213,2.2928,2.9571,5.6192,2.0885,3.5579,0.1077,3.7722,3.8249,2.5323,2.4207,4.1687,4.9952,4.6836,1.7285,5.0974,2.4095,1.2298,5.5746,6.4835,3.3755,1.1045,0.3543,0.6233,0.0002,3.2944,0.1283,1.6524,2.5238,0.2815,2.23,2.8648,2.8554,0.1703,0.7627,2.3802,0.1001,5.574,0.3675,5.1854,0.861,2.4908,2.0935,0.351,2.2991,1.1513,1.3441,0.6604,2.0159,0.468,3.8983,1.6303,2.0298,1.1716,1.185,1.7045,4.4792,1.3375,0.9876,2.1822,4.1681,0.0348,0.5703,5.3433,2.5707,2.1514,5.5549,4.146,0.0068,3.9599,0.7911,1.6299,4.1706,0.0052,3.5231,1.5398,3.2056,1.3217,0.3368,3.4858,2.894,3.0513,3.3645,4.0901,1.1069,3.2664,0.0348,0.1515,4.119,3.532,0.0791,1.8334,3.1861,4.0479,4.113,0.0294,0.9708,1.2393,0.0421,0.0007,0.9789,0.2426,2.1885,0.7443,0.5709,3.2906,2.3224,3.3742,1.8829,2.7556,3.5591,0.743,0.496,2.5548,1.8938,1.7109,0.4021,7.0066,0.5555,4.44,0.4903,0.337,0.0002,2.6763,1.7107,5.0278,3.32,0.2822,1.2891,4.0082,1.964,3.1781,0.2082,0.265,3.8791,1.2306,1.4339,2.5715,1.5984,0.1319,0.1763,1.4347,3.0474,2.1213,0.2255,0.2268,3.2108,1.2127,0.4814,0.332,2.6332,5.0355,1.668,0.5596,0.0924,0.0878,0.7948,2.1309,0.0807,2.2478,2.2726,0.1707,3.331,3.8544,0.3309,2.9769,5.7336,2.99,0.0002,3.0477,0.3371,2.8812,0.545,0.3988,0.6631,2.0518,6.7263,0.6357,0.0023,0.9313,0.4588,2.8317,3.4977,0.0756,3.2984,2.1009,1.7033,0.3207,2.2313,7.8043,1.3875,0.1539,5.5372,2.3501,0.8925,2.0075,3.1815,0.0821,3.1231,0.008,6.0649,0.9618,0.0351,0.2248,3.6385,1.9832,3.966,2.6137,3.5601,6.3912,0.8101,0.4559,2.3573,0.0464,0.3838,3.7006,3.2968,0.3783,0.7751,0.0484,0.0009,0.503,0.2517,0.5384,0.0001,5.537,2.7835,0.2298,1.4952,2.0522,3.3074,5.0217,0.1708,4.4093,2.5101,0.0241,0.3219,0.3383,3.2756,0.4648,5.0511,2.1289,1.3061,0.0001,2.9747,0.0955,5.3834,0.6984,0.2521,4.657,0.463,0.559,0.8551,2.2119,0.7738,2.6837,1.0502,2.1942,2.3892,2.5952,5.4429,3.4226,3.0669,0.0012,2.2264,2.8597,2.6734,1.0631,1.3322,5.2476,4.6197,4.1651,6.0934,6.3089,2.7763,4.891,2.217,5.3743,0.9696,2.93,1.1238,1.7179,0.9157,1.9787,4.8381,0.8214,2.8796,4.9984,0.4233,4.0371,7.0868,1.6904,0.8504,5.1188,3.081,3.5338,1.295,0.4187,0.0385,2.3839,5.2899,2.0086,2.6674,0.0451,1.7063,1.0094,3.3119,5.8629,0.0015,3.0895,0.1699,1.2025,5.1734,5.031,2.0156,1.7733,3.7483,2.5523,2.5898,0.6861,3.8611,0.0769,0.5067,0.6035,0.0002,5.5179,1.2493,2.996,0.5927,0.0002,2.2981,5.0449,4.4838,1.1295,0.0002,4.2394,3.3791,0.2452,6.2476,0.7576,0.0704,0.0005,0.5115]}
{"id":1269,"ended":true,"length":440,"gen_text":"USS Cushing ( Destroyer No. 55 \/ DD @ - @ 55 ) was laid down by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company of Quincy, Massachusetts, in September 1913 and launched in January 1914. Its main hull was the largest ever mounted in the United States.\n\nThe USS Theodore Roosevelt was one of the first U.S. ships to embark on the USS California, the first American carrier launched into space on the carrier.\n\nShip was scheduled to enter service after the Second World War during World War II. Although the Theodore Roosevelt was commissioned at the port of Sacramento on May 12, 1952, it was not commissioned until December 10, 1957 with the second USS Theodore Roosevelt arriving at the US Military Shipyard at San Leandro, California, on June 30, 1957. A full inventory of the carrier's vessels are found on www.turbelink.com.\n\nWith the US Navy retiring its first carrier class warship, the new USS Theodore Roosevelt, it became the first naval craft to be ordered to leave service in a new carrier class.\n\nThe design made some of the most successful naval battleships ever. The USS Tainan also went through a major redesign. As the third ship to be commissioned, the USS Tauntas, was fitted with an entire deck of 24 deck vessels, including one for each vessel, making it the most advanced vessel in the United States.\n\nThe USS Theodore Roosevelt class was developed during the war as an alternative to the USS Theodore Perry Class due to the lack of combat capability in both combat and coastal warfare. Despite having many advanced characteristics, the Tainan was considered to be extremely inferior due to its superior weaponry.\n\nIt also served as the first U.S. destroyer to enter service on a warship. It was also named after an older U.S. destroyer, USS Stennis which was used in WW2 during Vietnam. Although the Theodore Roosevelt was commissioned as a cruiser, its cruisers were not commissioned until 1964.\n\nThe USS Theodore Roosevelt class was designed for amphibious operations with the addition of the USS Theodore Roosevelt class during WW2. The Admiral's Landing Company used the USS Theodore Roosevelt class until the fall of 1950 due to the size of the new warship and the larger class of battleships.\n\nThe Roosevelt class was the first American destroyer to enter service. It is currently one of the most decorated ships in the Navy today.","token_len":492,"entropy":[6.4441,8.3866,3.9531,12.7307,6.9004,0.0569,5.86,5.645,6.1781,8.8789,6.9386,8.2257,6.5109,3.1432,4.2931,7.0042,0.4252,2.0783,1.4268,11.2326,11.396,7.2419,4.8192,1.0305,2.1796,7.6469,0.7442,1.3126,1.5508,2.7145,3.6299,6.0566,2.7634,5.5231,2.5091,3.4674,0.8953,0.4577,4.5844,3.1734,4.3495,0.6148,3.1744,4.8158,2.5916,5.8454,1.6533,1.2989,2.773,0.0135,1.3966,2.6613,0.0099,1.4857,4.0218,5.2621,0.1866,1.3956,3.3762,0.0115,0.7021,1.1148,3.4434,0.0059,0.0012,0.0196,2.5087,0.3131,5.0238,0.5145,0.8358,4.3345,4.645,1.7566,2.4373,0.8053,2.6927,3.1142,5.4969,2.8236,2.2362,2.9799,1.889,3.6522,3.6364,2.13,0.0003,5.0837,5.8923,5.5004,0.1888,2.4641,0.1115,5.4253,1.1971,3.8893,0.0325,0.0011,6.0122,1.2018,0.0016,0.4352,0.7557,5.3309,1.3985,4.5657,0.03,0.7344,3.2655,3.7976,0.9401,6.4583,0.2169,5.0606,2.9704,2.605,3.5576,0.0369,5.2417,0.2395,1.042,0.4885,1.5339,2.7241,0.3081,2.9462,4.5394,0.0114,3.4966,4.8937,0.6177,4.5554,3.3214,1.9579,0.0366,3.4982,1.363,1.2839,4.8685,5.9235,2.4938,0.6117,1.9699,3.2191,5.6308,0.0039,0.5233,0.0287,1.2493,0.7558,2.4219,3.3116,0.061,2.4579,0.1385,4.9291,4.1326,5.6881,0.1304,0.5047,3.8853,1.0205,4.5116,3.6947,3.8199,1.738,3.7943,0.0017,4.0895,2.934,4.1393,1.8214,0.2779,0.2664,0.4901,0.4636,0.0003,5.7182,1.0623,4.7466,0.5371,5.0239,1.4997,2.9419,2.9778,3.1035,3.3606,0.1365,1.2274,0.4639,4.9115,1.0521,0.3263,0.0411,2.2195,2.449,2.63,0.5735,0.8731,5.6447,5.1806,0.3951,1.7191,4.8473,1.1001,3.8309,1.9344,2.3471,3.1776,3.3798,3.5265,0.3197,0.8935,1.1232,0.0003,1.3487,4.9849,6.466,5.2712,3.3678,0.1653,1.3346,2.7091,3.6118,1.8726,0.1149,2.6063,3.489,1.3423,1.3107,6.106,5.8734,1.1054,5.3547,4.5916,2.4067,1.8149,2.523,0.6406,1.9867,4.8957,1.3272,6.089,2.3599,1.5698,1.6876,0.9933,0.8813,0.4866,0.8465,2.264,5.2677,4.1926,1.0394,3.7378,5.7214,0.0647,2.643,4.9048,2.9294,1.9423,5.6523,3.45,6.1068,1.6382,1.6486,4.3214,3.1608,2.5418,5.0443,2.9683,4.0946,0.7936,0.6235,1.9202,2.2756,3.8888,1.4112,0.5756,3.4439,0.0093,0.7907,0.5801,0.0003,1.0848,0.9463,1.0108,0.0518,5.8707,1.5865,4.7688,3.5533,0.358,3.7668,2.1459,2.1733,2.0951,0.1783,0.224,2.6578,3.3946,5.7334,5.7448,5.8048,0.0757,1.0141,3.3382,0.002,4.1326,1.9887,2.9361,4.1326,4.7644,0.6578,5.1967,0.9273,0.2668,5.2881,3.1952,4.5173,5.5456,5.78,0.4774,0.3975,2.8713,1.4383,0.0074,1.0601,3.157,2.2084,0.125,5.8797,4.3291,4.1775,0.0172,0.6088,3.8079,4.2477,1.3149,0.9472,0.0002,3.9885,3.299,3.3678,0.6074,0.966,1.8148,1.9694,0.0023,0.0007,0.0471,3.1403,0.5887,1.8864,0.4456,2.878,1.4148,4.0941,0.0008,1.0306,2.8223,0.692,2.9103,4.6747,0.9966,4.0346,4.6126,1.9753,0.0018,0.0031,0.0397,1.309,1.0572,1.3103,5.0995,2.4497,4.9131,0.7553,3.7535,1.6437,4.9881,0.9775,3.1305,5.6363,0.5071,5.7263,0.8081,4.1078,0.0525,0.8233,3.1578,2.4564,1.0081,3.7433,1.4474,3.0028,5.6914,0.0111,0.7796,2.1077,2.6525,0.2972,4.3038,0.5762,0.4783,0.0002,1.2761,0.8992,0.4105,0.0204,2.2969,0.9917,3.0402,2.3408,4.9989,0.004,2.084,3.8187,1.465,4.5753,0.0063,1.6035,1.6928,2.6407,0.2777,2.2476,5.7988,3.6131,0.1466,0.4368,1.3927,5.5077,2.2456,5.5321,3.7328,4.6075,0.4322,1.2566,0.2911,0.0229,0.9158,6.8187,1.8909,5.4906,0.0106,4.3908,4.5538,0.0159,1.1441,4.6001,0.3847,0.4141,4.1403,3.224,0.0798,2.2197,0.9156,5.3858,3.8696,0.988,2.6166,0.1282,0.6613,0.6689,0.0002,1.1139,5.2352,0.4779,0.9658,2.5564,0.536,2.6628,2.415,0.3478,1.5131,0.2078,2.8562,1.6672,4.2124,2.6744,3.6384,0.0061,0.4213,1.2813,3.6534,2.0789,0.3648,0.4237,2.5469,5.0011,0.3484]}
{"id":1762,"ended":false,"length":471,"gen_text":"The episode's finale is Don's day and the trip to Plattsburgh and Howard Johnson's Restaurant and Motor Lodge. As he and Megan eat in the restaurant, Megan expresses her frustration with Don over the fact that the whole affair is being edited out. Megan replies, \"I'm too pissed to buy things anymore. I never thought it'd actually happen to me.\" The episode finale shows that Megan's frustration is real and is not over. She asks Don if he'd been hurt. He insists.\n\nIt is stated that Don is upset because he wanted to talk to Megan about what he was going through. When Megan tries to talk to him about her feelings with Don, she is confused and he tells her that they had only met up at the wrong time last week. When Megan says, \"It's not real,\" Don says \"I'd like to talk to you, and he'll love it when he sees it.\" In a flashback, during the diner, Megan and Don are discussing the idea that Megan, Megan's boyfriend, isn't the same person who tried to save her during the robbery, and that she might have changed the law in any way she could. In another flashback, Megan says that Don had not told her what type of boyfriend he was until last Monday, but says, \"Oh, he came after Megan's right.\" The episode \"What Makes Me Funny\" is said to be the episode that \"makes me funny.\"\n\nThere is a scene in \"The Real Show\" where the crew is arguing about two reasons Megan would not trust the series. As Megan tries to talk to Mike, she gets scared and exclaims, \"Donny, no you won't, you don't, you don't...\" But she does not let her fear of Mike and trust his character develop; at the end, the show is in the middle of airing.\n\nAnime and Manga Differences:\n\nOn the show in which this relationship is expressed, Megan is the only one to remember her. The only time she ever says, \"I never thought it'd actually happen to me\" is for the fact that she did have something happen to her.\n\nGallery\n\nThere's a few photos from \"The Real Show\" and a poster with Megan.\n\nConcept Concept Art\n\nThe full concept concept art for The Real Show is available here.\n\nConcept Picture Gallery\n\nGallery","token_len":492,"entropy":[8.8917,3.2208,4.9551,1.9997,10.4942,2.4303,7.4267,3.3187,2.0071,7.4335,1.3941,9.8831,3.7426,0.0154,4.0929,8.5346,7.3395,0.189,9.706,3.5493,10.5104,5.9223,0.9513,4.5744,2.7406,3.4628,6.4741,8.1663,3.575,0.5903,1.7321,0.3383,2.9432,6.0428,1.2576,2.9142,1.4406,1.7783,4.2195,1.3329,2.9196,0.2941,2.757,5.412,4.6175,1.2402,2.6663,5.5876,0.4145,1.3164,1.8443,3.7765,1.6908,0.08,1.605,1.7493,4.9315,4.8257,1.5964,5.6781,5.7483,2.5142,1.664,1.0126,5.3316,2.1522,2.3549,2.1463,5.7383,0.9687,2.4872,0.3383,0.8043,3.3712,1.1158,6.5523,4.8208,2.0853,0.9753,2.3212,1.9518,1.7024,3.4591,0.9851,3.7012,2.4497,4.1949,1.4434,2.468,4.3937,0.8371,1.7518,0.3465,3.2291,3.5898,5.3594,2.2716,1.9887,5.9467,4.8955,2.2674,0.0014,4.6146,1.2369,4.4103,0.9217,1.41,2.471,2.491,2.2029,1.5435,5.5553,0.4782,3.7337,0.7329,0.5661,0.9291,3.2159,1.7497,2.4225,1.5147,0.294,1.0204,3.3908,0.6775,3.1838,0.0453,1.9702,1.29,0.7301,0.7157,3.0788,1.9664,4.5141,0.8398,0.3097,1.5965,1.7569,4.8838,1.1383,4.0834,2.498,0.0177,1.3187,3.4537,3.7949,4.9636,3.0223,4.329,2.4958,1.0122,5.6779,0.5377,6.0346,1.7569,0.4397,2.4388,0.6548,3.6366,3.2533,0.0328,3.2905,0.6501,1.9843,4.7689,1.0573,0.8561,2.0281,2.9011,1.8473,5.1462,2.0124,0.3006,1.0428,0.2987,0.2916,3.3409,3.2552,4.7479,1.9489,5.9239,1.113,3.6917,2.1995,1.1346,1.2152,0.6604,3.9513,2.9453,2.5557,0.5972,5.3875,1.1393,4.5342,2.4623,0.7481,3.1423,0.3211,1.4753,2.8766,1.5566,4.4832,2.2783,1.7809,4.8942,3.4298,0.7605,2.7509,0.2697,5.5579,0.0003,2.7657,2.1065,0.5699,2.7877,5.0768,0.0795,5.0842,1.1397,5.486,0.5686,4.32,2.3744,1.137,1.44,1.7519,3.7468,1.2785,5.3011,2.8994,5.5811,2.9805,4.9878,0.3128,1.5982,1.0828,0.5267,3.2622,3.4593,0.2458,0.15,1.1258,3.0192,1.2835,1.9568,3.2476,4.9705,2.4716,0.1819,2.6764,7.2451,0.0039,4.7119,1.6884,0.3486,3.4228,3.5487,5.9754,1.2689,1.9085,4.6039,2.437,0.0287,4.7087,0.5381,1.8124,5.308,4.0057,3.8299,3.2409,6.0855,2.8025,3.2282,0.898,6.047,4.6496,4.4775,1.2587,4.8904,0.3362,1.627,5.1692,0.405,1.0409,1.8369,3.3067,1.6924,4.9143,2.5222,0.9235,2.1313,0.9832,0.6643,0.0002,4.9353,0.7163,0.7914,1.5397,0.9805,1.9951,1.911,5.0601,4.8096,0.4402,0.4396,3.5688,4.551,1.7649,5.5883,0.9042,6.8751,5.9926,3.4834,4.1448,1.7968,5.2747,2.3695,5.8433,1.2441,5.3455,0.9709,2.6744,0.0314,2.6564,0.6644,5.9614,1.251,1.5788,3.7166,4.9551,0.9515,5.9094,0.0026,0.4508,0.0094,2.9814,5.6224,0.8892,4.5669,3.7254,2.9992,0.0032,2.5278,2.0634,3.1687,0.0007,2.7205,1.2254,1.1826,0.0009,4.5472,4.6504,2.3163,2.4887,0.5503,4.1035,2.5596,1.4286,2.9865,2.0615,3.7114,5.7423,3.39,3.5037,5.1912,5.4658,5.4379,1.1074,0.5007,1.7373,3.134,2.6808,2.649,5.1875,1.8404,1.3848,0.0298,4.8803,1.5534,0.8418,0.0002,5.3416,1.727,0.7857,0.0145,1.6116,4.3768,1.205,0.0003,5.014,0.6102,3.4771,4.6293,2.1253,3.7181,6.2569,0.9849,4.7241,0.1762,1.2421,1.6039,2.7271,1.4468,1.2197,2.1977,4.9261,2.2835,5.1338,2.8974,2.1986,2.9709,0.7618,3.3161,2.7787,1.8727,0.0375,1.0607,3.9996,0.6023,0.2744,0.0424,0.1387,0.0823,0.1448,0.0044,1.2641,0.326,4.5861,1.5579,6.3887,0.0575,0.8092,4.2175,4.7823,5.5032,2.9148,0.2622,0.2447,1.5978,1.1089,0.0002,4.1465,0.5629,0.0006,5.7783,3.2547,0.5268,3.8762,3.723,2.6975,3.5897,0.4802,0.084,0.0313,0.3537,3.0488,2.2649,4.2228,3.8718,1.2249,3.6336,0.5691,0.0003,4.6833,0.0685,5.31,2.1455,1.1007,0.0003,2.8958,5.5264,1.7107,5.2696,0.5348,1.0269,3.8471,0.0212,0.0042,1.6989,1.2085,0.9258,0.4245,0.3877,0.0002,2.8679,0.013,6.781,1.8349,0.2429,0.0002,3.823]}

At the time, batsmen in English cricket used curved bats, which allowed the batsmen to spin the ball to their opponents on the ground.\n\nThe Laws of Cricket was written by the English Lord Henry Browne II to replace the old law in the late 1700s as the most complete cricket law in existence.\n\nIn 1753, the English Parliament passed and the Parliament adopted a Bill requiring the use of the double bill for each ball held at the House of Commons, requiring the following:\n\nthe ball to be presented with two (2) points. To this point, the ball would be made for each ball holding at the House of Commons. A ball of which there may be more than two (2) points, and a ball of which the same point shall be laid out with the two (2) points but that ball shall be given no more than one (1) point, and there shall be a table and the size of the second point so far that the second ball shall not touch the second point. If any portion of the second point having been touched by the third point of the first ball, after the fifth or sixth points have been laid out, the third ball shall be to serve the first ball, and, if the two (2) points now presented then will meet the sixth or seventh point, there shall be two balls laid on the first ball, and on both the second and third balls two points shall be laid out on each line, and after three (3) points have been laid out will meet each other, and in five (5) balls if necessary, one point shall serve the second ball, and on both the second and third balls two points shall be laid out on a plate, and in one (1) ball of which each ball may be laid out may serve the third ball. If no greater number of balls have been laid on the first balls of the first ball, then the Second ball shall be serve the third ball. If a ball is found to be at least two (2) points greater, it shall serve the Third ball. The Bill shall contain two (2) points greater than any of the Second ball points.\n\nThe Laws of Cricket was passed on 8 December 1758. It is currently one of the most complete cricket laws in existence today.","token_len":493,"entropy":[9.605,2.3516,6.057,4.6159,0.3591,0.8959,7.9626,0.4027,8.972,2.3914,4.5722,1.1626,3.2047,4.7669,0.2531,5.6167,0.1801,2.2832,3.1102,13.8875,0.0423,2.7087,1.1263,6.0531,1.0049,0.4059,0.577,5.5777,0.1489,4.0859,5.2699,0.9812,4.4517,10.0244,2.3309,1.8038,1.4324,3.663,2.0431,1.4571,0.7313,0.0948,3.8864,3.1493,0.4095,3.6933,2.5698,1.7841,4.3305,0.803,1.6541,0.5679,1.4968,0.0006,1.84,2.2538,0.403,0.0268,2.8175,2.5736,1.122,2.0849,2.4372,4.6581,4.1446,5.699,5.6896,3.6551,5.4254,0.3924,3.2017,4.0846,3.1862,2.2131,2.7965,2.4448,0.0582,4.9412,1.6186,4.0128,5.6279,3.688,1.2698,0.9821,3.9396,0.3268,1.6807,0.0002,2.5,2.7905,4.088,0.2648,1.2508,1.6999,2.9145,0.8018,5.3947,2.4169,4.9283,3.743,1.4793,2.4943,5.4939,1.3489,2.7481,0.0052,2.5124,5.3998,6.0668,2.9066,4.4192,2.9407,4.5484,2.7066,1.1962,5.3926,0.2563,1.0862,2.4495,5.5963,1.537,5.2412,1.1307,0.2746,0.0003,3.5439,1.9699,1.0438,0.1274,5.9518,3.5439,3.143,4.8655,0.118,0.0278,4.9719,3.4871,5.1031,2.7869,2.2067,1.4879,0.932,0.9028,4.6801,0.609,4.284,5.467,1.8927,2.1054,2.926,1.7969,0.4077,0.5043,0.1923,0.0187,1.0208,4.2135,1.9577,2.5885,5.0321,2.6053,3.448,0.1853,2.5318,0.0715,1.3155,1.4372,0.0076,0.0059,0.0956,1.6788,2.2284,2.4389,0.1445,0.5704,0.0808,3.2864,4.3419,2.2207,2.3168,0.5519,4.2148,3.0962,3.6219,1.8322,2.3713,0.3633,0.0046,0.0069,0.0342,6.2318,3.7047,2.9181,0.6426,0.9011,4.0143,3.4534,0.9877,0.0909,0.985,0.2634,0.009,0.0092,0.3833,2.2682,0.8438,5.1423,0.2761,0.0655,2.2881,5.4031,3.7411,3.6396,5.8838,0.3122,0.3121,6.1915,1.2568,5.0342,3.4587,3.5886,1.2469,1.7913,1.9298,0.6823,1.3878,3.4824,0.4551,1.8103,0.7425,0.7092,3.189,2.6129,5.8132,0.2173,0.3231,0.9466,0.4026,5.5553,0.8539,3.6181,1.3485,0.8618,2.5752,1.0446,1.7023,0.224,1.8207,0.5069,0.7188,5.324,1.5276,4.1373,3.4218,0.2437,5.4047,1.8179,0.05,1.7674,0.2335,0.5247,0.9256,0.9126,0.4393,0.2031,1.0725,5.1647,7.102,1.7412,1.5069,0.3874,1.9376,0.6827,4.1605,0.609,1.6762,5.381,0.3502,0.0761,0.0028,0.0729,6.5366,4.709,6.754,5.0649,3.1952,2.4797,4.1314,1.3617,0.1158,0.8127,0.687,4.2718,0.1648,0.043,3.2241,3.1232,2.7683,3.5918,0.6791,2.6117,0.9652,1.0179,0.6266,4.7914,4.1968,1.4333,1.4538,0.1942,0.1859,0.2982,5.4045,1.9263,0.6158,0.46,0.4846,0.6305,3.0372,1.9778,6.4481,1.7973,0.9046,4.6207,4.2045,0.7928,0.0059,0.003,0.6239,0.5845,0.0377,0.1698,0.1406,6.6277,0.37,3.2275,1.2995,1.1174,1.3437,3.5843,5.7977,0.1918,0.0052,0.0085,2.5576,6.0676,6.2487,1.311,2.4885,1.1423,0.3236,3.2585,0.1916,1.2558,0.0631,0.6903,0.1653,2.3285,2.1199,0.1157,0.9124,0.0327,0.0425,0.0342,0.3993,0.0651,0.0629,0.0727,0.0265,0.0221,0.8025,5.2832,4.818,1.3227,0.5548,1.8605,2.7486,0.656,0.0057,0.0048,0.4272,3.0533,0.6645,4.6506,1.8922,3.0801,0.7882,0.8846,0.1604,5.1951,1.7337,0.4917,1.0218,0.054,1.3296,1.3914,3.4346,6.3247,0.9404,0.2713,0.7045,2.223,0.0896,0.0818,2.1599,0.5701,0.8583,5.3109,2.7467,0.456,1.0044,0.0987,1.1458,0.9067,1.1196,6.9184,1.2818,0.6285,0.9712,5.4642,0.2074,0.6412,0.0254,1.1025,0.8149,2.5839,0.7011,2.0901,5.4543,0.4207,0.6641,4.7128,1.3287,1.241,0.1331,0.0119,0.0146,0.1101,5.2586,3.4548,2.8302,0.2259,1.6181,0.2714,3.375,0.0934,0.4653,2.6993,5.2317,2.6686,3.5239,4.0968,0.5218,0.0043,0.0036,0.4871,5.7825,0.167,3.7232,2.3563,0.1243,6.1727,2.2769,2.8324,1.4933,0.9691,0.0002,1.1307,1.3193,0.071,0.0367,1.4202,2.2257,2.7171,5.1576,2.3375,0.269,3.6333,1.9049,1.3867,2.1614,4.2408,4.5657,0.0279,0.2189,0.7111,2.6596,1.4291,0.2403,0.3303,0.3532,3.3204,0.3633]}

At the conclusion of the program's football season on Monday night, those teams will both take on the Longhorns in a game at Fenway Park as they face the New Mexico State Aggies at the Fenway Park Convention Center.\n\nLosing five straight games to Texas A&M, then losing to the Red Wolves in a Big 12 championship game is not what I want my football team to do. \u2014 Greg Ogan (@OganSI) September 23, 2017\n\nAnd, in fact, that's what Houston Astros coach Bill Mazeroski called a \"good thing.\" After the Astros lost to the Houston Texans, Mazeroski said the Rockets were still an \"improving team\" and noted the team's offense, defense, ball position and defense were \"tied for second place in the country.\"\n\n\"What I am trying to do is, you're not going to get one more win from us,\" he said. \"We can put that in a good place.\"","token_len":494,"entropy":[9.2922,6.8017,5.0541,6.1629,7.7318,2.641,5.8046,3.3668,0.0884,0.6113,7.6526,4.2889,1.3706,5.1599,12.942,9.4933,1.4172,3.0991,3.6994,9.4502,4.4832,0.1815,1.6438,8.578,1.9993,3.847,0.7373,5.1595,1.0954,1.7374,3.5051,1.473,2.2353,2.6968,0.0109,3.3739,12.005,1.8533,2.7838,3.9406,0.2552,2.9768,0.1131,0.0116,1.742,3.4683,0.3252,2.9238,1.9763,1.6307,0.0983,3.1755,0.7409,7.3617,0.0006,2.8083,5.7879,2.1981,4.1061,3.1202,1.6722,1.9913,1.6257,1.7611,1.7859,1.8274,2.2036,3.7095,1.4815,2.6338,0.0003,5.8816,3.5636,1.2213,3.4455,4.1106,0.5031,2.7081,3.5968,2.7473,0.9377,3.0063,0.2979,5.1331,1.1356,3.424,1.5451,1.9013,5.011,0.974,2.8659,5.1266,1.5294,2.9017,1.0964,5.6036,5.9462,1.3439,3.2482,0.0202,1.0072,5.1867,0.0472,5.0833,0.0066,5.7929,1.9273,1.8325,5.0371,0.7545,4.704,0.2421,3.7235,2.2339,1.5821,0.4538,0.0178,2.3527,5.1265,0.8891,0.2534,0.0004,2.7616,3.9824,5.4028,2.4197,5.0063,1.6721,3.273,2.844,6.0638,4.5977,3.4184,0.2869,3.9194,4.9945,4.6273,2.4915,3.6255,0.9265,0.3754,2.2543,1.3163,2.0197,0.0004,4.5511,4.0435,0.7656,4.4867,5.7533,0.4109,6.2105,0.8594,5.9188,1.1453,0.4783,4.2357,2.8386,1.5093,1.5957,4.3028,4.0334,3.8056,2.2257,4.7453,0.9459,0.0282,0.0047,0.954,3.1455,0.1232,3.7039,1.4854,0.8639,1.7738,5.7677,0.3359,1.6099,3.5286,0.2828,0.6929,4.7019,0.5845,0.338,0.0002,1.7988,1.919,4.9333,1.0122,0.645,3.6385,4.9595,1.3033,2.1113,0.8329,5.4866,2.1713,3.8318,0.0338,1.4596,2.3254,1.2479,0.2187,0.3313,5.0346,0.1869,3.5367,0.9153,0.9461,1.7948,0.6545,2.6563,0.8205,2.8957,5.7683,2.0063,0.0983,1.6397,0.2599,0.0002,4.0549,1.2532,2.8465,2.6795,6.0253,0.9849,1.0829,2.2411,0.6073,0.505,0.2369,2.5432,3.9078,0.4066,2.5758,2.2446,2.3781,4.537,1.5566,1.9586,2.1983,2.925,3.0871,0.6051,2.1531,1.631,3.4234,3.721,2.1784,1.7342,2.1434,5.1873,3.0727,3.3603,1.4655,1.2604,0.3258,0.0002,1.8172,5.256,3.8047,0.656,4.9077,5.3369,2.1941,3.0049,5.6117,3.6143,3.6424,0.003,0.5957,5.3502,0.6345,0.0181,0.0,0.0026,0.9387,1.9526,4.6405,1.6889,0.0436,5.2382,1.8129,3.901,3.9247,1.4102,0.0018,4.7331,2.0002,1.3371,6.5654,1.1325,3.9552,0.0068,0.5102,3.7812,0.056,5.3053,0.1076,2.9826,3.7033,1.5331,0.1867,5.7735,0.3488,0.7894,4.9704,4.2718,1.8073,0.6962,4.4501,0.0189,1.4134,1.5829,1.9963,1.8177,5.1537,0.0018,0.0272,5.505,2.7882,2.5403,1.8282,4.2017,1.7462,1.4872,0.8769,0.0035,1.6962,2.5952,3.6629,0.0013,0.9555,5.5731,0.0246,0.3769,0.3422,0.0002,5.9039,5.2724,5.6041,2.5843,1.2177,1.7346,3.1213,2.3411,0.0035,0.0006,2.2039,5.2322,2.3091,1.7841,1.7722,4.5503,0.0521,1.5754,2.1438,5.1939,0.1114,2.1695,0.1205,3.1114,2.4904,4.5815,5.0478,2.576,3.3192,3.5388,0.1423,0.0282,1.0837,0.6522,1.2336,4.5843,5.2656,5.2231,0.1242,3.762,0.0249,5.3397,0.7077,2.1188,3.252,0.0001,1.548,0.0806,0.0002,5.1551,3.3228,3.3708,3.2551,0.0044,2.8069,0.835,1.3956,6.2137,5.1152,1.2308,4.2848,2.9398,2.1187,0.2866,2.8109,4.536,3.4137,0.7422,4.5906,1.9,1.5398,5.8301,1.9396,1.8817,1.4254,0.7837,0.9017,3.9917,1.6034,2.4699,0.4612,0.0216,0.004,0.0042,1.2659,2.2092,5.2429,1.9729,4.6096,5.1366,1.0176,5.3094,1.2468,0.4339,0.7223,0.918,5.285,1.6242,1.5867,1.3727,4.5357,3.4754,1.2427,1.5432,5.0687,4.3577,0.3351,1.9012,1.58,1.3791,4.7104,5.351,1.4684,1.6557,1.782,0.8625,0.1168,1.3747,0.597,0.0981,0.0002,1.3562,4.7624,2.1686,3.8659,2.4699,0.024,1.4408,0.4982,4.0757,3.6527,2.962,1.9752,0.7779,0.0158,2.2126,5.0393,3.0777,1.1906,3.0237,2.6246,1.4146,2.1261,0.2599,0.2049,0.3496,0.9652,3.9015,4.7359,3.2656,2.1118,2.1339,2.8151,1.0547,2.5229]}
{"id":1640,"ended":true,"length":453,"gen_text":"Kitsune are often presented as tricksters, with motives that vary from mischief to malevolence. Stories tell of kitsune playing tricks on overly proud samurai, greedy merchants, and boastful commoners, while others cite their own self-interest as their major motivations. As the story progresses, these stereotypes become more frequent. Eventually, Kitsune become able to make a living as a shopkeeper, master mechanic, etc, but once they have that job, kitsune often cannot be part of any real businesses. The Kitsune see nothing in life other than what they have at home, and that's it.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, we're talking kitsune, or people who can perform the art and artistry that Kitune is looking for. Kitsune do have a place in Japan, which is why they're so important. Kitsune tend to be very self-aware, and they come into contact with many different creatures around them, but it's really the kitsune who help them build what they build. Kitsune believe that there is something inside the mind, but Kitsune believe that their very being takes it somewhere other than what it's given them.\n\n\nThis is a very powerful thing to have a Kitsune like who is willing to fight for what they believe is right, but who also has the ability to understand the real world, and also to understand the way things are. Kitsune are capable of being selfless and willing to sacrifice their lives for what they believe is right, and Kitsune are willing to suffer in order to make sure everyone is at peace as they find the truth out. While these are powerful qualities to have, they're usually reserved and fleeting when compared to reality, as it's usually a temporary solution to a situation. Kitsune are so highly developed in this part of the world that they're a little more difficult to put down, but they're still something that they're able to put down.\n\n\nThe Kitsune we see often on television, however, will not be what you'd call unique. There are people who can only be called \"Kitsune\" by any other name, and people who have the means to help others through any challenge. These people call themselves the Kitsune of the World, and they represent a wide spectrum of styles. Kitsune, you're welcome, friends!\n\n\nThis article is copyrighted by Capcom Entertainment, Inc.

A school's history and heritage is incredibly valuable to students and parents,' he added.\n\nHe further added: 'It's the sort of history we should all be striving towards which will lead to great success.\n\n'We want the students to understand why we were raised in Rachael County. That we were born here'.\n\nRacicana's history programme is at the heart of any 'family' that seeks to learn, it says, 'as well as providing the basis for learning skills.'\n\nKVCA spokesman David Glynn said: 'We continue to support their education and heritage by publishing and linking directly to the history programmes. 'The School's history is extremely valuable to students'.\n\nAnd, he added: 'The importance of this relationship is that those with different ethnic groups will not be confused. The school's history is extremely valuable to students with no formal schooling. These lessons include learning about European history and history of the Middle Ages; European, Asian, Welsh, German and Portuguese.\n\n'It would be appropriate for the parents of children with disabilities to use these lessons in their children's school and school curriculum, but we will continue to support their understanding of the history and heritage of Rachael County.'","token_len":496,"entropy":[5.168,2.1427,10.6892,0.9056,2.737,0.9012,2.4706,5.5698,0.628,7.6451,6.9598,3.5361,2.3501,8.7574,6.6209,4.7005,6.5614,1.2351,8.9138,0.2897,0.371,0.694,3.4477,3.0921,4.2838,0.5401,1.6303,6.6292,0.1917,1.3612,6.9893,6.8161,2.2364,4.3493,0.3071,2.3081,3.9086,7.8987,0.363,7.0172,5.748,3.7813,5.2322,4.8566,0.2958,2.633,2.3723,1.9632,1.2057,0.5674,4.5913,2.0323,1.7526,0.0017,3.5953,2.1252,3.3328,2.7845,3.6944,1.5403,5.4694,5.2673,1.6875,1.5564,3.5898,5.3479,5.4044,5.7464,3.6971,0.6097,4.5826,0.1959,5.8913,4.4297,3.9331,1.2491,1.645,2.5067,1.9705,0.0167,4.7669,4.5937,0.3402,3.035,2.3935,4.6666,0.5976,4.3737,2.8696,1.3968,0.7357,0.9415,4.2973,5.1731,4.7604,5.9316,1.2304,6.4617,0.3579,3.5765,3.1392,4.1434,1.4224,1.9775,1.6754,1.6443,3.3938,1.1369,2.8252,2.0127,0.7347,0.0013,0.72,0.232,0.0003,2.0862,3.2184,3.7745,4.5404,0.1291,2.4821,2.8554,0.3574,5.24,0.8551,3.9433,2.9842,0.3324,4.9981,5.7461,0.7504,1.9455,1.6629,0.2272,5.2401,5.4914,0.6354,1.2028,0.0004,3.7298,4.7819,0.2544,6.9623,4.7797,4.1011,1.2962,0.3791,0.0141,1.7309,1.6878,2.2349,1.4434,3.7156,3.1611,4.1177,4.3646,3.5544,2.3093,4.0486,0.933,2.3416,0.9287,1.786,4.7165,0.0006,2.745,6.0072,0.3478,1.2828,2.1327,0.4243,0.0004,4.455,1.3138,0.2611,0.0011,0.0007,0.7034,0.4064,0.0067,0.1394,0.0007,0.0023,2.555,0.0001,3.289,4.7959,3.1096,3.1013,2.1079,5.1896,2.9544,6.3019,0.589,3.2775,0.4217,2.327,4.8542,2.7016,2.4062,6.3237,15.5512,8.0512,3.5036,4.3551,8.609,3.3992,4.7699,5.0646,3.1436,2.8304,4.4205,8.9452,4.702,1.8482,0.2483,0.0081,0.0765,0.0593,0.0052,0.0037,6.147,2.0099,0.539,3.7848,0.0065,0.0034,2.9964,8.5885,0.0203,0.0187,0.0498,0.4244,0.1168,0.0354,0.0044,0.0031,0.0012,0.0124,1.762,1.8143,2.4286,4.2582,1.1087,0.8071,4.5386,1.7311,3.405,0.1135,3.5818,3.4668,2.0406,2.7714,5.2389,1.3481,2.4238,0.102,0.6401,0.0003,3.4245,4.607,1.7192,0.2233,0.0072,2.3637,0.9961,3.4904,5.0726,0.0007,2.9206,2.6243,2.1392,2.3381,1.197,4.5099,2.3237,6.2879,2.7617,2.9384,0.3628,2.5728,1.7389,1.517,0.8576,0.0003,0.1322,2.085,3.462,3.0221,3.4322,0.339,3.0026,3.4653,1.699,3.4623,4.0775,1.9232,5.7411,7.8106,1.3662,4.1061,2.0344,4.0368,2.4856,1.3407,2.4895,1.3444,6.5738,0.3989,0.0003,2.9693,1.8141,5.4172,4.9963,2.0181,2.2186,4.9722,1.7667,5.6104,1.3538,0.5276,0.0017,5.4451,5.1635,5.2974,2.393,3.5434,3.1971,0.242,3.1246,3.1199,5.1009,2.0277,1.2532,1.7821,3.9275,2.431,0.0063,4.2059,2.6775,4.7535,0.143,3.4493,4.9503,2.6581,0.4781,0.0004,4.4706,0.1104,0.0068,3.8745,4.1127,4.9373,4.4784,0.6285,0.2306,0.0077,1.7143,5.3734,0.0368,2.3443,6.0135,2.958,1.3374,4.5862,3.9892,4.8737,2.7048,5.1811,4.9774,0.4374,1.1813,2.3213,4.3079,1.4977,4.7671,2.5179,5.2648,1.969,0.9812,1.4963,1.003,0.0133,0.6556,0.7317,6.8692,0.7187,0.0003,5.3803,3.1435,1.4925,0.2557,0.7173,0.0087,2.0592,6.0274,0.1166,3.2845,5.7615,0.9303,1.8363,5.2442,3.4582,5.2162,5.0249,3.8379,3.3992,2.8932,0.9332,4.674,3.4852,3.2339,2.7964,1.6067,0.6839,0.8688,1.3731,0.0644,0.2538,1.2207,6.058,5.257,4.9936,3.4941,1.5277,6.4886,4.7286,4.76,4.6801,1.2768,6.04,1.1271,1.156,2.5288,0.5589,1.3789,3.4759,0.657,4.912,3.0901,4.7143,3.9131,0.9082,4.7241,0.8248,4.3419,1.361,4.7505,3.6968,0.5407,0.0003,0.325,3.0856,4.6849,0.4644,4.7611,1.1609,1.7089,3.879,1.6999,1.1045,1.5166,2.2128,0.2332,4.182,2.8189,0.3418,2.4244,0.6008,2.0806,0.0559,2.1317,2.3268,3.7048,2.8233,2.2189,2.8248,1.7087,2.7289,2.5192,0.0392,1.8917,2.115,4.6504,0.4125,1.0713,0.6928,1.4647,0.5043,0.2161,1.2337,0.0374,0.0012,0.1082,1.145]}
{"id":1077,"ended":true,"length":494,"gen_text":"The Season Two DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include the cut cold opening of Michael playing with his new putting toy, Dwight expounding on his new father's success in life, Michael's brother discussing his impending divorce, and Michael's own struggles as a father figure for his daughter, although those scenes seem to be a bit more cut from this version of the episode. In the opening scene Michael takes Michael to the pool and asks his sister and Michael's brother to see for themselves, and the two laugh and wave goodbye to each other. The second half of the episode was shot with the back of a car with two of the set up lights set to flash and the scene changes to reveal Michael looking out of the window, with Dwight looking into the glass through his window and Michael holding Michael's hand with a large green ball of light in the direction of the open shot. Michael was also mentioned in the scene as being in the water, and later is seen underwater. In this part, there is a cut scene where the scene changes to Michael and Dwight standing on the water, with Dwight's hand held between Dwight and Michael. Later in this segment, there is a scene in which Dwight tells Michael that if he can't win, he won't get it. Also, in the beginning of this episode, Michael has a little pink \"ring\" in his hand, indicating that he is in a \"ring of fire\". Michael then takes a picture of his little pink ring on fire and takes it over to Michael. When Michael returns that day as promised, Michael gives out a hand full of money and Michael's sister holds his arm through the glass as the ring slowly begins to glow white, then a ring of light begins to slowly burn through the dark spot in the back of his head at the beginning of the scene. Later upon returning to the drawing board as a kid, Michael is seen in an extremely drunk man who has a bottle of Bud Light with him and a big hole in the back of his mouth. There is also an image of Michael trying to pass out as he is inebriated. Other footage featuring footage from this episode appears in the following DVD: The Beginning (The Beginning DVD), The Season Two DVD (The Season Two DVD), The Seasons 1 and 5 DVD, The Seasons 6 and 8 DVD, The Season 2 DVD, The Seasons 9 and 10 DVD episodes, and The Seasons 11 and 12 DVD.","token_len":496,"entropy":[10.1374,4.8764,4.8929,7.0218,1.8995,4.6049,0.0038,4.3615,0.0181,1.4636,4.2422,0.9419,1.0515,6.9121,1.823,6.0219,0.41,0.346,1.8868,5.3234,12.4225,3.8611,2.1689,6.3945,6.4437,3.4708,1.5869,4.2455,12.6321,3.6172,1.4576,9.1361,10.3716,1.1152,0.3637,0.986,1.7369,5.7588,0.5265,5.4276,2.159,2.6707,0.5923,2.2348,2.0892,5.9552,5.5655,1.2844,5.8637,1.2106,0.829,1.049,1.2559,1.1038,4.9015,4.846,3.2407,0.739,1.2227,2.3546,4.9473,1.0267,3.3142,1.9108,6.2562,6.0439,0.6348,5.1187,0.2967,1.2737,3.8189,1.6162,2.3785,3.2575,2.3055,3.8549,4.8952,1.1404,0.2961,1.0084,0.3414,3.6345,1.3089,4.2767,0.7566,1.5362,4.5181,2.4281,1.1799,1.4245,5.3402,1.7084,3.2412,4.4322,3.2418,4.8223,3.0448,1.3655,3.0395,1.62,4.9508,4.0789,0.0637,2.9385,2.4695,2.97,1.8225,4.7993,2.1549,3.7644,1.1734,1.1536,1.1667,0.0123,0.6343,2.1624,3.5292,3.0131,0.0588,0.2647,0.6992,3.6195,2.7114,2.6967,2.0356,5.3166,0.7367,1.0423,2.2077,3.5837,4.1927,3.141,0.6326,5.2795,3.9698,3.2667,4.3955,2.2168,5.0625,2.5543,1.3359,3.8184,4.5985,0.5683,4.0867,1.0632,4.142,2.371,1.4386,0.5527,0.7957,2.5336,3.178,1.1216,2.2838,3.5132,0.3638,4.5424,5.4138,1.9912,2.3787,1.8252,1.6757,3.9741,2.8826,0.4003,0.4749,3.95,1.8373,4.2669,5.6271,4.1217,1.4098,1.9347,2.8209,2.9171,4.2192,0.1522,1.113,5.36,4.567,0.3598,3.0099,3.8725,2.8056,5.0062,1.0546,0.6299,2.5318,2.9307,2.1258,2.4939,1.3868,3.921,2.3968,2.076,3.8151,4.8327,0.8349,5.6378,2.0354,2.7458,2.1567,5.1046,2.9973,4.5092,0.931,1.1181,3.1095,1.0607,1.0873,3.508,2.993,2.4921,0.4064,1.5598,2.9486,0.2378,3.5028,1.6547,0.6095,2.8938,1.3283,2.0192,0.8378,3.5246,1.6778,4.2704,3.6857,2.1143,1.1411,0.1752,1.0525,4.5079,1.1925,2.524,3.6073,0.4265,3.5329,0.2962,0.4523,1.2356,2.1368,0.1428,0.9017,4.0122,0.2458,1.0318,3.4387,0.3466,3.4471,1.4264,4.3709,1.6691,0.6351,2.4829,0.003,3.6032,3.9712,0.6896,4.624,0.8545,1.458,0.9465,3.9891,0.184,1.0834,0.5063,0.3119,0.6519,3.8974,1.3463,5.3364,5.188,5.0337,6.0029,0.4315,2.019,0.1478,0.355,1.4549,3.4161,0.4151,0.5121,1.2876,2.5513,1.7811,3.5692,1.5445,1.0464,2.1451,1.399,3.5147,2.5657,3.8244,1.7664,2.3522,0.2818,1.6658,4.7939,0.2754,0.1468,3.1519,6.5418,1.5366,3.6766,0.6085,6.2741,0.4007,1.7366,1.4327,3.737,0.7352,4.4409,6.5926,1.2977,6.2245,5.0122,0.3755,1.4775,3.9956,5.8657,0.6688,4.9894,1.8275,0.0249,4.5895,1.7205,3.0482,3.3995,3.6641,5.2698,1.7454,3.1025,4.2983,0.3912,4.0194,3.024,2.7645,2.8328,3.8572,3.0693,0.1145,1.8608,4.7474,2.7089,3.9555,3.4938,5.2441,0.6623,2.6115,2.0617,0.1998,4.0677,3.6448,2.4584,0.4251,5.6898,4.2785,2.0773,0.3528,3.8078,0.0824,1.2921,2.1393,6.085,0.6798,4.2497,0.1858,0.3609,0.7839,0.2872,3.3857,8.1663,5.2352,1.1,0.752,6.0446,0.5742,4.4468,3.0186,3.0634,0.2368,0.3728,2.2162,1.131,2.4402,3.4402,5.3038,5.3296,4.2097,4.8232,2.3647,1.477,3.431,0.208,4.658,0.5795,3.4138,0.3581,1.9487,2.165,4.4542,4.7988,0.4378,1.3274,1.7667,0.5066,0.1135,4.8179,0.7967,4.9592,0.5354,0.6414,2.2032,3.4429,0.1722,0.6041,6.1241,0.0562,5.2038,0.6083,3.1299,1.0475,1.3756,2.8419,6.9997,0.0001,0.0052,1.2028,6.1956,5.4558,6.3044,6.4,0.7793,0.5968,0.0958,4.7748,0.8133,0.6961,2.399,3.9243,3.588,2.0084,5.6301,3.3529,4.0437,3.937,1.7989,2.7431,0.7146,4.699,0.6005,0.2884,1.2827,0.5006,0.1434,0.1172,0.0621,0.3145,0.5138,4.0606,2.3374,1.0216,5.2341,0.222,1.6233,0.4458,1.5508,2.0254,0.1304,2.2337,0.1061,0.4061,0.3708,1.5639,1.5391,0.0774,0.5424,0.3006,0.581,1.9962,0.1232,0.1282,0.07,7.6003,0.5149,1.269,0.4834,1.2278,0.9607,0.1728,0.0789,0.2943,1.3356]}
{"id":1054,"ended":true,"length":462,"gen_text":"Four former England representatives have been inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame : Bill Beaumont, Martin Johnson, Jason Leonard and Wavell Wakefield. Seven former England internationals are also members of the 'Gold' list in the sport's history. But many of them have been forgotten because of the secrecy around their involvement in the country's national tournament.\n\nThey are the latest men to enter the UK's elite rugby field, though the youngest players are almost always older than 18. In recent years, just over three thirds of the country's highest four-day competitors have appeared on these lists. In the four years between 2000 and 2001, it was virtually impossible for all of the four most active members to have been invited on the top list, since the process was so extensive. A few of the players may have made it onto the list long ago, although their contribution to a player's record has long been questioned.\n\nAt the moment, it appears that the competition is no longer about the 'golden rolls' and there is no longer a limit to what players who have been present can do. It won't change overnight. It is still essential for any professional rugby club to get on the ballot as some players are still not aware they are getting on the list when they are not in the top four at the beginning of one year. When the competition gets bigger, so can the game.\n\nThe latest is the latest to be inducted into the Hall of Fame and the players who have played on it are the same ones who got in on the top. The two youngest are also the oldest three-time Premiership Rugby Champion, Ian Burrow-Haynes and Dan White.\n\nIt is not the only place where a player has gone on tour, but only so long as they are part of a team at the top. Former England scrumhalf George Hamilton was recognised in 2008 for helping to lead the national team to the final. He will be inducted into the Hall of Fame by the end of the season.\n\nDavid Gray and John Tully are the most recent men who were inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame. Both were highly gifted rugby players who set a world record. Two of the two of them did very well and both will play in the upcoming internationals in Germany, France, Italy and Brazil. There are three other prominent men in those countries and the final should be at the weekend.","token_len":496,"entropy":[7.9557,7.6721,8.4259,1.8204,2.0232,7.9841,0.002,0.1449,0.2149,4.4256,3.1715,0.4495,0.0136,0.0021,11.1815,5.9451,5.9709,0.7763,0.0129,0.5035,5.7988,3.9764,0.2654,5.9639,7.6449,1.4636,13.8581,3.1806,8.8537,0.5696,0.4099,6.8634,2.4042,1.7404,2.668,0.0145,2.5521,1.0277,4.9498,0.4973,0.1302,4.9115,5.9724,3.6281,2.2263,5.2659,1.1239,4.7108,1.531,1.0848,0.4358,5.673,4.4366,1.2006,1.6557,1.5176,1.931,3.3284,3.8212,1.172,1.5076,5.4097,2.6247,0.896,4.1232,1.0546,0.8745,5.3685,0.1727,3.6364,5.4471,0.426,0.7435,0.0011,5.0578,1.9462,2.7211,4.2414,5.2633,0.6711,3.8616,0.3221,5.098,0.7666,3.2923,2.3304,5.2885,1.4688,4.4747,2.5948,5.697,4.1081,1.5266,4.6407,2.343,3.9064,0.5641,4.4308,0.3989,3.4347,3.1836,0.1411,0.4942,5.6477,2.0719,3.68,5.6724,0.1025,1.0355,2.9051,0.1717,5.1001,6.8566,0.6413,3.398,5.7771,0.6029,6.2405,1.4103,5.2823,0.5057,0.6805,3.525,2.1802,5.5225,0.8289,1.9217,3.4885,0.0783,4.9736,0.1847,4.8557,0.6227,5.8423,0.845,0.7396,4.658,1.5034,1.0321,3.8742,4.3728,4.6903,4.0827,2.2916,2.8806,1.9067,3.7674,2.7546,1.2146,4.2661,3.269,1.7312,4.8623,1.6868,5.6611,1.2938,1.7293,4.5656,0.7307,5.0249,3.0058,1.5613,0.7222,2.634,5.3777,0.5161,3.9624,0.9861,1.536,0.3175,1.2098,4.193,1.2065,0.4579,4.3028,2.8094,5.2417,0.6578,4.3486,4.8478,0.1254,4.6813,2.3262,3.7463,0.5231,2.3672,0.2839,0.5079,0.0002,5.1937,0.7949,3.0961,0.257,3.0315,2.5291,0.8791,1.7526,5.8384,1.2288,4.9926,0.0669,3.4103,1.8184,4.9549,1.3511,1.6931,6.1117,0.7919,2.1114,5.2984,0.8496,1.4614,2.6381,1.0785,5.9424,0.7032,2.4227,2.4108,5.4589,1.5237,1.7754,4.9118,3.0157,1.2538,0.557,3.012,7.308,0.0051,3.4971,5.0534,1.3971,2.881,1.7349,2.9609,6.0839,1.6989,4.1234,4.4691,1.6191,3.0073,0.1728,4.4914,3.6542,0.9054,5.891,3.1732,6.1389,2.5539,2.092,2.7357,3.7018,4.7899,1.9688,1.0382,4.6587,0.7332,0.9806,1.1709,5.2643,0.5747,1.5967,3.1621,3.0412,0.9021,2.8075,1.6034,3.6786,1.2696,4.0935,0.0374,6.5586,2.0346,0.3102,5.9182,1.8907,3.7575,3.9302,3.2771,0.4075,3.9504,4.2656,0.6332,4.6982,0.7321,0.7617,0.0002,2.2086,4.7264,4.9757,2.5118,4.4354,3.0313,2.206,1.1555,0.0003,0.2662,0.1043,2.4542,0.144,0.0071,4.287,2.1694,4.2901,1.421,0.7417,2.1351,1.7442,1.0545,1.3057,2.1993,4.3752,2.3184,0.3646,5.5143,4.2484,2.4256,0.588,3.1099,4.1787,2.4526,4.6963,3.9093,4.318,5.3518,1.7864,2.7402,6.222,0.7044,1.1236,4.7762,2.8411,4.0505,1.2793,4.9627,5.1557,2.9581,4.9539,3.2643,1.6718,1.5265,5.2614,4.8738,0.9462,1.3412,0.0002,3.6626,0.6756,2.1964,2.5045,2.6415,3.8743,1.3383,3.1313,1.3417,1.252,4.0115,0.471,8.0895,2.3625,1.6192,5.2478,5.3396,1.305,0.2563,0.9962,0.968,3.691,0.0036,1.0532,1.2711,4.6376,1.0191,2.3714,1.608,4.1759,1.3999,3.899,0.0294,0.8581,4.3879,5.1098,2.379,5.9849,2.0964,3.629,1.6956,3.6661,1.5267,3.3478,0.8662,3.8139,0.4803,0.4481,1.0173,3.148,2.884,1.8217,3.7847,1.05,2.2094,0.0039,0.5983,0.0586,0.5541,0.2374,0.0054,4.4259,0.9631,1.3263,0.0006,1.1189,2.5286,0.4792,0.5874,0.0002,4.8642,5.6993,3.3896,4.2048,5.0686,4.5333,1.7694,1.389,3.4883,0.7716,2.5646,2.5647,2.6054,1.2971,0.0012,0.1999,0.0421,3.0509,0.0157,0.004,0.0053,0.0014,0.7927,2.8804,1.5249,5.639,6.3882,1.9754,0.1633,1.1944,5.3148,2.0409,2.4534,0.1076,3.0268,5.9643,0.8662,1.0457,4.0306,4.8371,0.088,5.616,4.4585,0.1566,3.7616,2.438,3.0329,4.0461,1.6511,0.5062,3.7588,3.5229,0.5377,2.9804,5.1444,1.4718,1.843,1.2128,1.5002,0.3988,4.1835,0.1234,5.5265,0.9882,3.1927,1.5362,5.515,1.9723,2.3035,5.5957,2.8974,2.9805,2.4395,5.3714,5.5011,0.5741,4.6027,0.7049,4.6862,0.5479]}
{"id":4961,"ended":true,"length":452,"gen_text":"Reruns of The Simpsons which aired in the Thursday time slot against new episodes of The Cosby Show were ranked as low as 73rd in the weekly ratings ( compared with third place for The Cosby Show in October 1986). (The new episodes of The Cosby Show featured the most popular comedian in the United States: Larry Wilmore.)\n\nOn the whole, the ratings have improved since its early spring airing but there have been significant differences between these three shows.\n\nThe Cosby Show and The Cosby Show Season Four\n\nThe first episode of The Cosby Show is titled \"The Great American Scandal,\" and it was aired Feb. 20, 1987. On the other hand, The Cosby Show Season Four is the one that started on Feb. 13, 1990, ending with a one-hour premiere on Aug. 14, 1991.\n\nBoth shows still aired in primetime in the same month, which makes it easier for syndicators to build a following among younger adults. Also, the new episodes were often aired on Friday, and there's a chance the program would show up on Comedy Central's main web series, which airs Sundays.\n\nBoth shows received excellent ratings in their original markets on Thursdays and on Saturdays. However, the latter shows have been hit by controversy (including an episode airing on Fox News where the producers complained about the quality of the show which was so bad that ABC canceled it).\n\nComedy Central had been considering changing its network schedule until this summer despite the huge increase in the national ratings of its new flagship sitcom, The Cosby Show. The network decided to skip the broadcast of The Cosby Show Season Four this past December.\n\nIn addition, The Cosby Show Season Four premiered Thursdays at 9 p.m. on NBC, and on Thanksgiving and Christmas night in the US.\n\nAs the beginning of the television calendar in the 1940s was largely filled with live-action comedy, many younger shows were struggling to reach their full potential.\n\nBut this year, the first CBS sitcom, The Cosby Show, reached the Top 10 in the US on Monday nights, and it was also the first new sitcom to top the charts over the span of three weeks on Saturdays at 11:30 p.m., with new episodes airing every other Saturday.\n\nThe Cosby Show Season Four debuted Wednesday, Jan. 8 at 7 p.m., and it is the first year that episodes will be air in primetime on Sundays.","token_len":497,"entropy":[7.1667,5.9561,2.4871,5.731,10.9944,9.2868,5.0711,1.8674,2.2397,12.0092,6.4082,0.1762,7.651,6.9922,3.4717,0.5664,1.7263,8.7252,0.0339,4.7613,5.6505,2.0563,5.1443,0.1798,6.4023,2.7719,2.0478,1.0398,6.684,1.8272,3.9456,11.7285,1.7518,8.8567,1.0043,2.0449,1.765,1.648,0.0253,3.2836,4.2288,5.3879,0.7696,4.7603,2.4034,4.1301,1.5037,0.8135,0.7841,0.0807,0.0041,4.9771,2.6954,3.0877,3.4164,5.6351,1.8224,0.7029,4.1034,0.0224,4.4971,4.0062,0.6395,0.0025,1.7895,0.7008,0.0008,3.8099,1.5772,4.4108,0.0858,1.2091,1.8948,3.4076,2.2753,2.5134,4.5508,5.0317,4.1846,2.0088,4.6393,3.029,2.0728,0.1221,3.5259,2.914,1.4907,4.2443,3.1895,0.6908,0.6481,1.5548,0.0002,1.404,1.3873,0.0381,4.8948,0.6474,0.1506,0.0213,4.9386,5.2397,2.3437,0.0003,1.1459,3.1714,1.4308,0.3906,0.673,0.0314,0.0027,3.2088,2.7154,0.447,1.4562,4.7753,3.0968,4.6162,0.0444,1.832,2.1218,1.6766,2.7136,2.5686,6.0456,0.0362,3.5609,0.3191,2.2319,0.7177,4.0559,1.4619,3.049,0.5408,0.0128,1.6535,0.047,0.0041,1.1783,0.5597,1.567,2.554,4.3269,1.5263,3.4867,2.5872,2.385,0.0061,3.477,0.1938,2.964,1.0538,5.5922,1.9647,1.962,4.8414,0.3943,0.7252,3.5659,1.3494,4.1415,0.0036,3.7702,0.1386,1.3879,0.3082,1.1029,0.0001,3.9301,1.1708,5.8568,3.2699,1.8497,3.5913,0.0,2.6951,1.4109,3.4375,3.2293,1.5528,3.5225,3.3959,1.4948,2.9988,0.9288,5.8417,2.9848,0.2031,5.3642,1.8358,1.9183,3.2255,3.4181,3.2117,0.6194,4.8541,0.1405,1.5652,3.1926,1.0926,3.6958,5.5335,4.2585,1.501,4.5785,2.655,2.7335,3.775,3.7456,1.7348,1.5487,2.2307,5.1519,2.2679,5.6511,0.5439,0.9186,5.6713,0.0045,1.8401,5.2226,5.5991,3.4726,1.3663,2.4725,2.2933,2.7964,0.998,0.4577,0.0001,3.5447,0.547,5.3729,5.4075,0.2724,1.6476,3.4849,3.1493,5.4202,4.6015,5.1174,0.0044,1.3553,3.4631,2.1508,1.0462,2.6014,0.0042,1.6073,4.2654,2.7399,2.6925,1.4781,4.7375,1.6355,5.0346,4.5565,3.2413,3.3245,1.1869,3.7498,0.9235,3.9586,1.6609,3.4334,2.0372,4.1914,4.2077,1.4157,1.3962,4.2051,0.0516,0.6772,1.6348,6.9377,1.6045,5.4885,1.9085,1.0749,6.3837,2.144,0.9533,1.5166,0.6352,0.0002,5.6961,0.0536,0.0259,3.7975,3.1289,4.3971,4.8049,1.0899,4.3125,1.056,5.3704,4.2282,2.5169,6.936,1.3749,6.0682,4.8354,0.0646,2.4246,5.8106,1.008,2.571,2.2968,2.8174,5.7888,3.5631,0.7582,1.0829,0.1915,0.0045,0.4149,1.9186,1.6894,3.3276,0.5662,5.5486,0.8692,4.8757,0.2997,1.668,0.0244,0.0043,1.4505,0.2302,5.0603,2.6666,4.0837,1.848,0.7964,0.0002,2.9072,1.8664,0.5574,2.2157,0.0159,0.0059,0.6429,0.1299,4.159,6.4246,0.0085,0.7906,1.3915,0.483,0.0004,0.0002,0.2546,1.4353,2.5375,1.3643,1.477,2.0366,6.036,3.5375,0.1598,4.004,3.7116,1.5819,3.2477,0.9099,1.1407,0.0002,4.8695,3.2368,5.9754,0.066,0.8491,5.891,3.2446,3.9692,1.3952,5.5152,0.0288,4.0537,5.413,4.2179,0.0956,4.8472,1.2263,0.0666,3.5368,0.6677,3.9018,4.5483,4.3801,1.3444,5.1387,0.6235,3.2997,2.4103,2.0595,0.1437,0.4979,1.6435,0.0003,4.8966,4.1823,1.3172,0.7864,1.6754,4.7895,5.9245,1.6269,0.8671,1.2169,0.5696,0.0096,0.5424,5.8793,1.9919,4.1068,1.05,1.3527,1.3224,1.6601,2.5435,3.7976,2.3361,1.7819,2.0562,2.2435,1.6856,2.7094,1.1585,0.6167,3.9143,1.7188,0.6052,4.1791,0.437,3.1158,5.2748,0.4373,4.3921,0.0056,2.5872,1.128,3.0981,5.2399,5.2233,3.109,0.9842,0.9415,0.2965,0.0007,0.0001,2.4966,2.8117,5.2498,0.4455,0.9618,2.5423,1.6758,1.9835,1.1639,0.4733,0.0002,1.3739,1.2758,0.0063,0.4591,0.1577,3.8083,4.5596,1.2122,2.6451,0.0041,3.258,1.4538,3.5839,0.4197,0.0005,0.0003,1.3259,0.9351,1.7471,3.3087,1.4066,1.0023,5.8863,0.9695,6.1139,3.1959,1.1892,3.9435,2.1019,0.6217,0.0001,0.7743,3.183,0.5778]}
{"id":4738,"ended":true,"length":470,"gen_text":"Starting on 1 May, the teams conducted a three @ - @ day test at the Mugello Circuit in Italy ahead of the Spanish Grand Prix. The test gave teams the opportunity to test their teams' cars in the rain to assess their competitiveness. During the test, teams' engines were tested in the open road using an electronically coupled system.\nAn interesting finding was that the new Renault P1 cars were less likely to crash during these tests due to lower tyre pressures after overtaking. The new team cars were also able to overtake more efficiently and at a much higher speed. This could indicate that the car was actually safer after being stopped by an overtaking driver, with more powerful engines pushing the limits of a fast car.\nRival Lotus F1 team Red Bull Racing also showed what they can expect going forward: the team's new cars, which feature a small four cylinder engine with a variable valve cover with the addition of a twin-cylinder engine, were given the best overall performance possible.\nOf course, there are many reasons why teams would rather show off their new cars than their previously designed cars. For instance, given that the tyres in these cars are small and can feel very muddy, some teams would rather not show off their vehicles in public. But if you were to take a look at the Lotus F1 teams driving in the open road, most (85%) are equipped to show off their F1 cars. At the same time, the open road teams are more likely to have the opportunity to take on a few teams in a given race. The FIA is planning to release more details over the next few days regarding what's going to be next for F1 when the Red Bull Racing team takes on Honda and Lotus. The Red Bull Racing Team also announced a partnership with Pirelli to develop an Mugello Pirelli Race car, a vehicle designed largely for drivers of this class. Although the F1 team has already invested considerable amount of money into the project, the team will not hesitate to make it happen in the next few weeks, allowing them to take on the Pirelli team during the Red Bull season.\nIn any case, the Red Bull Racing Team are one of the best teams on the planet. With the F1 teams having such formidable resources, they are going to have a formidable defense. We're optimistic that F1 teams will continue to show off their cars in real time and build up their team's reputation.","token_len":497,"entropy":[4.0817,5.1847,3.0004,1.7957,1.7075,8.2033,9.9352,0.7407,4.5093,15.4935,8.1979,5.1453,7.7993,3.3835,2.9722,1.4472,5.7114,6.1184,0.0276,2.5898,1.415,1.4924,6.6807,0.0012,0.5962,6.8052,0.7699,0.0024,0.5991,2.1122,3.0411,6.0723,3.9357,1.9292,1.1338,0.0274,1.8383,1.0221,4.8937,1.0989,2.7078,2.0728,1.7477,4.8376,3.7316,3.2073,1.1659,5.1566,1.2683,5.1235,0.3427,0.966,0.5389,1.8026,4.4362,4.063,0.999,1.0537,1.931,1.4384,3.8652,2.7977,3.7043,3.3453,5.0743,4.5914,2.1056,1.2929,1.3842,14.5631,4.457,4.7867,0.9284,0.3621,1.2995,5.6395,3.9434,4.7186,0.6801,3.5611,1.643,4.1474,2.5605,0.0212,3.1261,2.5494,4.1916,0.3185,4.465,0.005,5.0772,4.2526,0.911,6.6788,5.2722,0.0005,0.7624,1.9701,3.1467,5.7,1.8678,1.3394,1.3144,3.643,0.001,4.3804,2.2934,2.9699,2.8085,4.0261,1.0428,2.1868,1.4277,1.9142,0.8156,2.3483,3.8264,2.6944,0.3242,0.8979,4.2978,1.7852,4.8934,4.0035,3.6649,4.1342,6.3032,2.3264,2.9885,0.7124,0.0502,0.9873,2.5048,4.4758,3.1592,5.4474,1.0559,5.1363,0.8666,3.5114,0.5364,4.0415,5.1757,0.5087,0.303,0.5048,4.4705,4.1799,4.3523,2.369,0.0872,0.8137,3.3716,0.0124,1.201,3.2775,3.652,5.4067,1.94,2.0437,4.5306,6.3617,1.221,3.5368,2.2303,2.11,1.6775,1.6983,2.4904,4.1496,1.1603,2.5693,1.1994,5.4072,4.8452,1.9321,1.0437,2.3502,0.9928,5.1974,1.0683,3.4096,4.3946,3.3114,4.3843,0.0027,0.8737,5.3563,1.3194,3.279,0.0007,1.9842,0.36,2.129,5.1851,1.2678,3.8095,4.9562,0.7084,3.977,0.6439,1.1793,5.5251,0.3588,0.2684,2.6052,1.1053,2.2188,3.8317,1.3593,2.7803,2.4114,3.9858,5.9942,0.4123,0.3803,1.134,0.3784,1.4404,4.2756,5.6703,4.181,0.653,0.6407,2.0255,1.9851,0.0384,5.6805,1.2116,1.2824,5.2244,3.5476,2.4102,0.5796,0.4497,4.876,1.3592,3.624,5.7637,2.9536,5.1557,0.5807,4.2275,1.4642,2.0534,1.3354,4.2217,1.2884,0.2603,0.339,4.0302,2.1237,1.9446,0.981,3.784,2.988,1.8086,3.832,0.8087,2.5403,0.9207,0.8588,0.0868,0.6497,3.9696,0.3608,0.0132,3.4116,5.511,2.9324,0.848,1.8008,0.4343,0.9987,5.5973,7.0613,4.1785,0.1833,4.0997,4.938,2.5478,3.273,0.1154,0.1607,5.3433,0.0239,0.2571,1.4379,5.4212,0.5541,1.0096,0.0125,0.0821,1.9624,5.7151,0.1865,2.9213,1.3576,2.4882,0.283,0.0688,2.8792,2.6989,3.0577,0.0243,4.2336,3.1975,2.4798,4.184,2.9368,1.8517,2.2521,4.421,1.7604,0.8462,3.0664,5.0844,3.3952,4.4443,0.4628,4.1282,3.6904,2.0465,4.4666,0.0468,0.425,0.5191,1.9454,2.3854,3.2425,4.2466,2.0715,0.6922,0.7992,5.2014,0.3922,2.7141,0.0019,4.2333,1.0745,5.4202,0.0535,1.7753,1.4828,3.1652,0.545,5.0689,2.6595,3.4459,1.47,3.6602,2.2909,0.0195,0.5592,3.5951,3.5545,3.0109,2.2699,2.9657,0.1865,5.6365,0.2663,0.0011,0.9313,2.1053,3.3456,4.8915,0.2884,0.0011,5.8664,1.879,0.0053,4.9762,2.2856,2.2772,3.5372,3.6107,2.3151,7.8239,1.0628,4.7541,2.7405,4.8223,2.1095,0.4273,6.0426,1.1114,3.8511,0.0193,1.5676,1.687,2.4391,4.7752,3.5588,4.432,0.328,0.6,1.0158,1.1082,1.469,0.1495,1.4038,2.1831,2.5463,3.4842,5.8945,0.0129,3.4022,3.5736,1.6839,2.7532,0.6054,2.3112,0.4497,2.0729,2.9403,5.1099,1.8611,0.3117,2.8675,0.8181,1.6857,4.3176,0.0224,0.0067,2.2785,5.5266,0.5649,4.9286,0.0026,2.2775,0.31,0.5577,3.4366,3.6957,0.2243,0.0156,1.5292,1.7493,0.0105,1.1505,1.5317,3.4113,5.1489,0.1077,0.1634,2.2213,0.7794,3.256,0.2033,1.3535,1.2125,3.6292,1.847,3.9932,0.0129,2.9246,2.4003,4.4465,6.7534,5.5844,0.7226,2.0834,1.5701,3.3034,0.0195,1.369,1.2797,5.5237,5.9959,1.6589,4.5136,3.4265,6.2959,0.2362,4.0472,0.0087,1.2377,0.3071,2.5433,0.1801,2.3062,0.2485,0.096,1.3875,1.6648,6.2208,0.8193,2.2091,5.6368,1.7071,0.5532,3.2394,1.2071,2.493,1.5103]}
{"id":2219,"ended":true,"length":464,"gen_text":"It was in Dallas that Nash established himself as a formidable point guard, beginning a decade as one of the game's top players. During his first year as a Maverick ( the final year of his rookie contract ) Nash played just six minutes a game.\n\nThe fact is Nash was known for getting his players to play poorly.\n\nThe reason Nash was known for playing hard is because he was known for wanting to shoot over screens. Nash had been known for coming and shooting the ball over screens since college, and that was never good enough.\n\nThe other reason Nash has stayed in the game long after he has stopped getting into free throw shooting is because of his bad shooting habits. While he never came out and came out hard to the basket with a perfect shot, Nash did his best to shoot over the post.\n\nWith more ball possession and a better handle in the pick-and-roll, Nash wasn't a great defender during the 2004-05 and 2005-06 seasons. As part of his development, however, Nash has taken to working on his perimeter defense during the second half of his rookie season. He's not a great defender at this point, so he's worked on his ball handling to develop a shot passing game.\n\nIn 2005-2006 Nash played just 14 minutes per game against the Grizzlies in the second half which was the worst in the league. In 2003-04 Nash played just 12 minutes per game against the Suns. As coach of the Spurs ( then Dallas ) Nash had a few games in which he put up good numbers as well, but nothing that really set Nash apart from the rest of his team due to his poor shooting.\n\nIt is not necessary to have great shooting to play extremely well in this league, so in 2007 Nash was part of Spurs' second straight SuperSonics appearance which was very impressive.\n\nIn 2008 Nash was called up to the NBA before being drafted by the Houston Rockets. He was part of the Houston team that won NBA championships. In 2009 Nash was named Second Team All-Star when it was introduced, and won an MVP award when it was announced.\n\nHis game, however, was not great at all during his first pro season. After going under the knife by a team owner during the team's first game in Phoenix he was sent off in the second half. As is the only reason Nash returned to basketball for another season, Nash has a good shot now.","token_len":497,"entropy":[3.677,4.6111,7.6367,2.019,10.1897,9.3499,1.202,0.5295,1.1843,4.6933,5.0245,0.0763,1.5338,7.1541,3.2701,4.9689,4.0166,1.406,0.0191,0.1376,3.8817,0.0017,2.2391,3.7591,0.6932,5.1846,0.92,2.3672,2.444,1.8017,0.8179,6.701,0.0009,5.2267,13.2933,5.4351,1.0832,0.2855,0.7876,2.4469,0.5437,5.5788,0.1698,3.5817,3.6094,4.7092,0.7195,1.1385,0.5878,1.8698,2.5384,0.1295,2.8419,5.5524,2.8729,1.5435,1.7436,4.9978,0.9768,4.2515,2.6241,2.8499,1.0653,2.5965,5.7388,1.3114,2.5767,0.0002,2.7862,4.3522,1.3843,1.5224,1.0359,0.5499,2.3295,6.322,1.5261,0.7101,0.7187,1.1551,1.7247,0.4465,5.7294,0.4502,5.216,5.5746,4.4787,0.8129,2.1953,2.9692,3.471,1.0606,1.0198,6.0925,5.7327,1.6392,3.3556,0.6752,2.4201,0.6322,5.205,4.0289,1.3729,1.4798,3.068,1.5261,5.5001,3.7609,0.9166,0.7598,1.201,0.0002,2.651,4.0301,0.6995,0.6737,5.1763,6.2452,2.2054,1.5098,1.1493,3.1706,0.6781,1.3713,2.3522,4.2581,3.3222,3.4265,4.6103,2.2897,0.969,0.5364,0.4612,1.9311,0.9164,5.5002,1.3911,2.4177,0.1573,5.0927,1.2995,4.497,5.5602,2.42,1.3647,5.587,0.6142,3.9102,3.3546,2.4155,0.723,4.4208,2.0626,4.4444,2.2569,0.5801,2.7082,3.2885,4.4771,0.3753,0.3094,3.4833,2.223,2.2532,4.1814,1.9466,0.85,0.0002,4.6929,4.7925,5.2226,2.6946,1.8066,3.2628,1.1831,4.9129,3.942,0.563,3.1427,0.5987,0.0005,0.0008,0.0112,0.3391,0.2299,5.6295,0.0008,2.3857,2.0308,2.1448,5.5199,1.4005,5.3023,0.1431,0.1762,4.7582,0.4846,0.0077,0.0017,0.2047,0.4386,4.2703,5.2321,0.0009,1.4261,3.3971,0.9714,6.0683,0.0034,0.383,3.8577,4.0868,2.3056,4.6882,2.4013,0.503,5.1727,0.9523,5.7257,1.0662,4.5996,0.1683,0.1061,0.9779,2.6717,0.6806,0.337,3.1314,2.3222,3.8231,2.2725,1.0711,0.7174,2.2536,3.3793,0.2682,0.6675,3.0927,1.0924,1.1698,3.9436,0.8135,0.9484,4.9167,2.1737,2.4807,5.3993,1.7003,4.4663,5.1955,0.3536,0.7419,0.2551,0.0002,2.8009,3.6066,0.2285,3.8165,0.8166,2.7297,2.1419,3.6238,0.2416,1.0806,0.0501,4.8336,0.9231,3.8493,3.1506,1.1037,3.2385,0.3868,7.9533,1.259,2.1097,1.9715,3.1491,0.3823,0.5631,0.3766,2.3183,5.9182,0.2881,0.3795,0.5971,1.0667,0.6822,3.2386,0.0941,0.2331,0.0141,0.6277,0.0953,3.5002,2.0107,4.8087,6.4943,1.6022,0.156,4.5595,3.1215,5.0161,5.4021,1.4033,0.3021,2.5083,1.7032,4.931,4.3171,2.6531,0.6844,0.1846,4.8401,0.312,2.9813,0.2093,4.0633,1.4732,1.4762,0.6876,4.7954,2.2721,3.8486,3.4299,2.0645,0.6624,1.0536,0.9472,0.4859,0.2704,1.5771,1.7561,6.9363,0.0626,0.3722,2.5717,0.5058,0.519,0.3552,0.0002,4.1435,2.7559,2.7156,6.0509,0.2253,3.2643,2.6121,1.0611,1.4853,3.1283,4.9713,0.424,1.9714,2.345,0.1668,0.8768,3.6071,4.1937,5.5588,1.038,1.7697,5.4408,0.0053,7.3797,2.3669,3.3093,4.4345,3.8658,2.5813,0.0041,4.1599,5.1619,1.0758,4.6051,1.4226,0.7755,1.186,0.0002,1.9353,1.4884,0.7315,1.4378,4.3262,0.6836,0.7317,0.4923,1.5401,5.5623,2.1101,2.6555,0.4684,0.2902,4.0485,0.0075,0.9329,1.5226,1.5655,3.788,0.0012,0.5394,3.4101,1.824,0.1487,0.9563,5.6278,2.1457,2.8751,2.1082,1.3209,0.3142,0.8259,2.1494,6.3605,0.3784,0.021,0.0527,1.4404,5.4726,3.5363,0.17,6.6354,2.3222,0.6522,3.9276,3.4957,0.9422,0.3599,3.0779,0.4677,0.0893,2.0073,0.6567,0.685,0.0002,4.1861,4.321,4.4877,1.6183,0.032,1.3192,1.3117,1.9503,2.6795,0.38,2.6559,0.5982,1.6705,5.9066,0.2001,0.667,3.5642,4.0797,4.3787,0.8818,0.2684,4.1616,3.4367,2.891,5.192,3.5707,0.9429,5.2012,0.1639,1.4064,1.9848,2.101,2.7212,3.197,1.1976,3.6318,3.342,2.5505,0.4719,0.606,0.6594,1.3972,4.0957,6.1177,1.7367,6.1305,1.2218,1.2405,5.7581,0.4007,4.3547,3.3661,3.3823,0.7727,0.9396,1.9132,2.7016,3.9265,3.5146,1.6091,5.122,1.3618]}

The statue featured the faces of many veterans of the American Legion and was featured alongside the name of the original owner, the late Alfred W. M. F. Fitzgerald. The sculpture is in the National Park Service Museum and can be viewed through its lens.","token_len":498,"entropy":[11.048,0.2711,2.9433,8.0365,0.264,8.2984,5.252,0.5221,1.2044,5.1469,1.0719,8.8079,1.4916,6.2147,6.6669,7.8326,0.0083,9.16,3.198,0.8341,6.4762,4.2765,3.211,2.1767,0.7773,2.6306,4.2054,1.1494,1.0931,5.0297,2.2277,0.6582,4.7347,13.2456,1.5593,3.0906,0.6444,0.0506,2.0764,4.5189,2.5708,3.1527,3.9425,2.1142,2.7653,2.2527,2.3972,0.1393,4.892,0.7171,0.0002,0.5726,1.396,0.0032,11.6541,2.0293,4.7624,0.0066,0.0149,0.0003,0.0003,0.0092,0.0142,0.0029,0.017,0.0007,0.0006,0.0007,0.0048,0.0002,0.0,0.0012,0.0011,0.0162,0.0429,0.0095,0.0021,0.0019,0.0004,0.0007,0.0005,0.0011,0.0002,0.0003,0.0008,0.0008,0.0213,0.0013,0.0016,0.0008,0.0008,0.0005,0.0031,0.0023,0.0038,0.0004,0.001,0.003,0.1053,0.0003,0.0028,0.0024,0.0004,0.0002,9.0257,2.6841,2.3346,5.7807,4.4148,0.1302,3.2488,2.0248,5.5733,1.2271,4.3586,0.2236,1.5123,6.3354,1.8427,6.5238,0.0029,0.4325,2.4985,5.1696,3.6954,1.7702,5.4936,3.7053,1.6904,0.9284,1.7446,2.269,5.3504,5.0558,1.9929,4.1977,3.3316,4.3772,1.3028,3.3467,2.1489,4.7577,3.3697,4.9066,3.9741,6.234,1.9137,5.3247,3.1783,2.4844,3.6231,5.5976,2.702,5.1442,1.5263,2.4847,3.6704,5.0212,1.4534,5.6362,4.2576,3.109,1.1735,3.2044,0.5339,2.1435,3.6497,4.0372,2.3762,2.4853,2.7345,2.0939,3.7739,0.1878,1.7054,3.6261,2.3535,3.8358,4.2191,2.6126,0.5779,3.2781,1.4977,1.7193,0.2893,1.0576,0.985,0.8668,2.5911,0.2603,1.3658,0.487,1.7339,0.5614,0.0002,5.0919,5.6938,0.002,0.0011,0.0187,0.0006,0.002,0.0023,0.0003,0.0021,0.0032,0.0017,0.0038,0.0008,0.0049,0.0128,0.0038,0.0002,0.0005,0.0006,0.0164,0.0577,0.1554,0.0009,0.02,0.011,0.0033,0.0017,0.0007,0.0013,0.0005,0.0019,0.0042,0.0006,0.0004,0.0023,0.0006,0.0005,0.0019,0.0066,0.0032,0.0009,0.0043,0.0062,0.002,0.0049,0.0008,0.0001,1.1966,0.0017,0.0024,0.0006,0.0016,0.0013,0.0002,0.0028,0.0003,0.0013,0.0014,0.0048,0.007,0.0002,0.0048,0.0005,0.0013,0.0054,0.0022,0.1054,1.2902,4.7932,0.022,0.1787,4.534,0.5478,2.4211,0.8998,1.5687,5.508,2.9674,1.4808,1.1628,4.4612,2.4432,3.2965,3.1832,3.4494,0.3003,4.5237,2.7335,6.2522,1.6151,1.3873,0.0002,5.0084,3.1021,5.9844,1.8818,2.7962,0.1716,2.4654,2.4101,2.6779,3.2667,3.7888,5.0131,4.7172,3.4501,0.1918,2.9338,3.8975,0.8174,4.5559,0.3291,0.5134,3.6959,0.5453,5.8465,0.5213,3.148,0.0254,0.3226,4.6946,0.683,2.5514,0.0466,3.7594,4.388,2.2328,5.6085,2.8077,1.6042,3.0261,6.6597,0.7572,4.7376,1.3494,0.5729,0.9771,0.6747,5.9093,2.3876,5.1232,1.866,3.2687,6.031,0.3951,5.0088,0.5993,4.9359,5.4711,2.9357,0.7152,4.7419,0.7331,0.733,1.2005,2.1953,1.3809,1.9097,1.4561,4.3229,2.15,5.0601,3.6801,1.5959,4.2806,3.1388,2.7111,0.2732,0.4106,1.0177,3.1231,3.1661,0.6418,1.0619,0.9123,1.9042,1.1766,1.3579,3.8438,1.4944,4.8076,5.9425,3.1843,5.4804,0.0205,0.3763,0.8921,0.0003,3.0709,4.6015,5.091,0.2043,0.992,1.6258,0.4255,4.6404,1.4132,0.7075,4.0184,0.7065,3.9834,0.4541,5.1526,3.1993,5.4018,3.1151,1.327,3.2185,0.8032,3.0839,0.2129,0.2616,3.2718,3.7192,2.5257,0.1182,2.3747,0.9996,7.1436,0.4451,1.2192,1.1657,2.3447,5.7536,0.5774,1.2407,2.5811,2.1017,6.0309,4.4193,2.2048,5.2934,4.8368,0.43,0.4691,1.8302,5.1652,2.7175,2.1783,3.3276,0.1035,2.919,0.2245,2.7243,0.1307,4.4544,7.6167,3.7658,4.833,0.7588,2.0701,1.1725,5.2705,2.1573,5.3197,0.0299,3.7887,3.3004,1.4296,0.7162,2.5598,2.1957,1.8593,2.6201,3.6588,4.5106,0.8437,5.7398,0.4971,1.5476,4.8885,3.4033,2.0015,2.664,3.3364,5.1379,3.5961,0.2177,5.6212,1.3653,5.2689,3.5003,5.9253,0.4336,1.9462,2.3383,2.5789,3.4826,1.016,2.605,2.9166,0.1053,1.9664,3.1963,4.2042,0.0593,1.7277,3.8838,3.2446,4.2128,1.0874]}

{"id":3045,"ended":true,"length":467,"gen_text":"During the summers of the mid @ - @ 20th century, parents in the US and Europe dreaded the annual appearance of poliomyelitis ( or polio ), which was commonly known as ``the 'N' Virus' '. According to those who worked with the disease to develop its symptoms, the symptoms were most prevalent on the winter solstice.\n\nAn interesting finding was that the two conditions did not change over time. The two main types began to overlap in age before childhood and had a fairly severe tendency to go away, and the poliomyelitis became more common on these days. In the mid 20th century, children who were bitten with the polio were more likely to die of it, but later would recover. Some reports even suggest that the polio was less common the more recently bitten children were bitten. In later years, the poliomyelitis became a serious symptom in children living in large cities.\n\nThis can be attributed to the fact that poliomyelitis can be transmitted quickly, and there is no longer a big stigma attached to having it, so some of the other infectious diseases associated with poliomyelitis in the US include tuberculosis and hepatitis A. As for some vaccines, there is no cure for polio, and polio-related illnesses can be treatable using common sense. Some even say that some polio vaccines, which lack the safety features, only make it harder to get the virus to infect children, which means the vaccine is much more effective.\n\nEven though there is no cure for polio in Europe, due to that fact as well, there is widespread belief that even if the virus survives for a long time, it will go away without any effect from further protection. In response to repeated vaccine application, polio virus may even persist in the body for a long distance time at the expense of protection.\n\nA very good example of this would be that if someone is bitten by an insect, they may develop a similar rash that will last through the night. They may take two days out of their day and die, or may even take up residence in a house for weeks afterward. However, people living in rural areas may, through the winter, take longer to recover due to the cold and humidity in the summer months. This is how many diseases spread without even a known cure, and some even spread with vaccine. When you get vaccinated though, you can have a real life effect if you just start getting the vaccine.","token_len":500,"entropy":[1.9437,10.1849,1.4791,2.5298,4.3492,14.7194,7.303,5.2295,3.4868,2.595,0.4225,0.7809,9.3357,3.4026,1.8766,2.5173,2.3219,2.7536,10.1595,1.5205,7.3413,5.9088,0.0429,10.2269,2.8083,0.1757,0.0136,0.0136,2.8477,9.3541,3.8375,2.5003,2.3912,1.8596,5.8312,3.3133,0.2672,8.9143,3.1415,5.091,5.8359,3.8054,4.2705,2.4416,5.5984,5.3134,0.0034,5.9,0.8066,4.2954,1.406,1.6123,2.787,3.9827,3.2186,2.9701,1.4859,0.2536,1.573,3.0854,1.508,4.4575,3.7163,3.1126,1.1557,5.4053,0.8647,0.006,1.9032,2.7755,0.2407,5.7801,4.6844,4.4996,1.7609,0.5071,1.5434,5.3862,4.0522,2.8647,0.1701,4.6327,2.0666,0.4141,0.6217,1.9745,3.416,4.2613,3.4125,7.0243,0.4003,3.429,1.3699,3.4665,5.5617,5.5534,2.7434,5.0562,1.5477,5.0007,5.2318,4.5367,0.4814,4.3427,0.9346,3.1688,2.8243,2.2939,3.9089,0.045,0.002,0.0044,0.013,4.141,0.7476,1.5917,2.8577,5.7465,0.856,0.3957,2.8755,1.7238,3.6292,2.071,0.1536,0.0362,0.2722,4.2206,1.9575,1.3247,5.3332,4.2039,1.9068,2.3534,2.6089,1.5682,0.2006,0.05,2.7457,1.9375,2.2991,1.7521,1.9929,4.7082,6.1374,2.4254,0.9625,5.2914,4.3248,3.9583,1.992,0.1555,1.5168,1.7644,2.46,4.2509,1.0964,5.8914,1.7704,4.686,2.0152,1.1341,1.1092,0.4096,0.5453,3.1124,6.0619,0.4024,0.3142,1.4956,1.4852,0.0112,0.0001,0.0005,0.0018,2.2458,3.7233,2.9782,5.8547,2.7529,1.3276,5.1164,0.4831,4.9743,0.9339,1.24,0.748,0.0004,4.2259,5.1874,0.4664,2.6815,0.1803,0.6851,0.7408,0.0122,3.1216,0.0837,0.0008,0.0009,0.002,3.0593,1.0228,2.2638,5.2194,1.9786,1.2569,3.8159,0.9788,1.0817,4.1661,1.1112,6.2138,3.5975,1.0072,0.0219,4.4644,1.4065,2.708,2.585,4.3763,2.9537,0.4166,5.5823,5.6889,0.1869,3.3904,0.0077,1.3457,0.0125,0.0005,0.0004,0.0018,4.5308,0.9874,0.6687,6.1676,3.4361,1.8454,2.6608,2.0696,0.5921,4.458,3.3475,5.6157,5.8707,0.3342,2.0421,0.8925,0.8953,3.9021,0.3862,0.8254,0.9976,1.7096,3.8492,4.0516,1.6674,2.2561,2.8318,0.9527,4.4707,0.0049,4.9836,4.9895,1.2935,0.5367,4.6442,5.8477,2.0146,0.4769,4.5425,3.1362,0.7767,3.3238,2.7369,5.8082,0.8496,3.4357,1.9352,2.9018,6.1925,3.2778,1.9966,2.4336,0.8381,1.0133,2.166,2.0039,1.6282,3.1794,2.9594,2.4282,2.1758,4.1066,3.0421,1.2601,1.6734,4.1471,0.8935,0.7208,1.1718,0.6003,0.0003,5.3133,1.0508,2.8294,1.026,0.6252,1.1764,0.1426,0.2663,2.1185,3.743,0.2191,6.3857,0.0576,6.1756,2.819,7.6034,0.3063,2.3193,1.6802,0.8009,5.4536,1.7381,0.2588,5.482,1.7471,1.7391,1.946,5.2133,3.3272,1.2305,1.548,0.1893,0.4104,0.5262,0.8691,4.9368,0.6439,5.1428,1.8946,4.7014,4.1232,5.063,6.1739,0.3084,2.5453,6.0864,0.3599,7.6825,3.6337,5.2007,0.4539,2.5744,4.0444,3.9828,3.8711,4.4546,1.0169,0.7714,0.4576,0.9626,1.2548,0.9969,8.6061,4.9594,6.281,2.2492,1.4151,0.0026,4.8302,0.5142,1.092,0.0003,4.1851,4.6565,2.9231,1.9409,0.2262,0.8861,3.8095,0.0424,3.9569,3.8782,3.2838,2.463,1.4943,1.0321,2.6637,3.9371,1.0418,1.9058,1.2061,2.9105,1.4745,5.5374,3.102,2.5965,3.9529,1.7215,4.3041,0.9329,2.0473,0.9072,4.8206,0.6561,5.028,4.1716,1.7254,5.3633,0.2344,1.0766,1.3192,2.6772,4.8643,2.0547,2.0851,3.4373,2.8958,3.1876,3.219,4.7207,0.3919,0.9126,2.2269,1.7228,3.3841,5.173,0.2516,3.9821,0.0637,5.0132,3.419,0.3841,2.959,0.0959,1.9355,6.033,4.966,2.3037,4.361,0.3497,3.9616,2.8497,0.3095,1.2984,4.1541,0.0047,0.7802,2.8793,1.506,4.1666,2.6883,0.6905,4.2592,1.5838,0.4992,2.6942,1.3431,5.5063,2.7917,4.387,2.3363,4.7376,4.688,2.6385,5.4451,1.0165,2.1678,0.9156,4.5593,3.2818,2.7005,3.3145,5.0184,1.4601,5.9449,2.7229,3.0152,3.3719,6.5244,0.1226,1.2265,1.9298,3.4335,1.4157,4.752,3.5812,3.1089,4.5872,0.3129,5.6422,4.2378,2.5566,1.3775,1.6111,1.0898]}

That same year Yeats and Ernest Rhys co @ - @ founded the <strong>Pharoah Fellowship<\/strong> \/ group, which aimed at building a Christian community in England and Wales. In 1892 Yeats was invited to join the movement in Rome, where he served as director until 1894. In 1902 he married Mary Shelley. In 1903 he returned to Wales and began to work for the Hermetic Association.\n\nA century later, at the age of 60, he became the new head of the Order of the Golden Dawn. Following the return of the Brotherhood of St. Benedict, Yeats remained for years in power as the second Head of the Golden Dawn, which led to its establishment as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in 1922. He was appointed the Grand Head of this new order in 1936, but died in 1953.\n\nIn the 1970s he was instrumental in creating the early research in the creation and propagation of mystical ideas based on the teachings of the Golden Dawn. In 1984 he held a press conference in London advocating for the formation of groups for the investigation of magical phenomena, like the \"Friedrich Nietzsche-Berg\" or \"Eldritch Dreaming\".[1] Among other things, he also presented the results of the research of the Eichmann-Wissenschaftssung f\u00fcr Rachmaninw\u00e4nft into several possible mystical hypotheses, such as the mystical dimension of perception that originated as a result of the human experience of the mystical dimension. In 2005 he published his book The Hermetic Mystery of Power (Zurich ed, 2011).\n\n[1] N\u00fctzel, Paul P. \"Wisdom of the Ancient One\".

The Doctor discovers a seemingly harmless flower in one of its flowerbeds. The Doctor goes to see the garden for his daughter's birthday. Eventually, he meets an attractive woman wearing a silk-cotton robe, and she shows him the flowerbeds she has dug up. He begins to make his way to the palace. He is met by three young women, each with a bouquet of flowers. However, it is revealed that the four young women are the ones who found the flowers. When the Doctor confronts them with the flower, he tells them that they had killed him. He explains to them that he destroyed him, which is confirmed by the flowerbed. The Doctor then sees more beautiful flowers while they try to save the Princess from some danger.\n\nThis incident can be considered to be some sort of a case of what will be left of the real Doctor in a future episode, which might also have involved a relationship with the other female characters.\n\nExamples of examples Edit\n\nLive-Action TV appearances Edit\n\nMusic videos Edit\n\nThe Doctor and Amy have a few recorded songs (including \"Let's Dance On The Moon\") to accompany the episode's closing credits, which will appear on the album.\n\nThe ending is the only song where the characters play the words \"RISE TOGETHER\"; however, due to the nature of the episode, it is cut. The two are interrupted by the closing song that reads \"I'll Fly to Rome\", which makes the ending cut. It continues with the opening credits after the scene where Amy finally gives birth to her daughter on the final day. It closes by giving her an apology. One scene, when the young women are being groomed for dinner by a young man, tells the boys they are being groomed to make the love vows for the wedding (although it says \"don't ask me\".)[2]\n\nThe show's finale was made available for download during Episode Six. The episode ends with the story ending, which was cut short when one of the heroes, the girl with the flowerbeds, was seen giving birth. The episode is re-edited, with the full ending cut off. The ending for the finale is also available for download from episodes 3 and 4.\n\nContinuity Edit","token_len":501,"entropy":[9.7561,3.1666,4.6885,8.0383,1.4873,1.2485,9.673,3.1961,2.5223,11.6207,2.0937,4.0861,0.1821,2.963,0.6499,1.4728,0.7601,2.1978,9.1166,1.2771,3.9832,0.2182,1.5457,8.0437,13.7802,9.7739,2.8219,12.5325,0.8644,6.5047,7.0344,2.8334,0.0773,0.0008,1.0577,2.7827,2.6142,5.6784,2.7397,8.0739,4.1243,5.6868,2.058,4.3483,0.0691,2.9986,4.0605,2.0761,0.0463,1.2072,1.698,0.9487,4.1551,0.6934,2.4457,1.3178,4.7164,4.1403,2.7311,4.266,2.9843,1.2126,1.3556,5.8789,0.7032,1.4034,2.5802,3.9889,3.3601,1.7872,4.602,0.4185,5.5981,3.5081,4.2251,1.7973,4.4323,1.8825,1.7055,2.4289,4.4579,0.2378,0.9898,1.9052,0.9374,2.2065,3.5683,1.8231,5.1187,1.1362,0.7158,1.8349,4.8952,0.4386,4.2005,2.0201,0.3132,1.0124,0.4097,6.1559,1.7012,1.8318,2.3841,2.8732,0.1047,5.6148,3.0224,1.3259,1.1257,4.5982,1.4464,0.8236,4.0263,0.0019,0.255,0.2836,0.8795,4.9584,0.031,4.1905,0.6069,1.9557,0.1816,1.1246,5.2388,1.7261,0.2824,0.9717,2.8071,2.5352,0.4946,4.0637,0.3587,2.3646,0.8841,3.3408,0.8947,0.5672,4.2029,0.822,2.9565,0.7013,2.0652,3.1544,1.3279,3.43,0.1306,0.7033,1.6492,3.0782,5.9234,2.5528,0.9755,1.9028,3.74,2.0557,0.279,0.1522,0.9339,6.0951,4.2726,2.0004,3.9703,2.0341,5.9292,0.3314,0.8018,2.9416,0.5327,2.0439,1.3414,1.2232,2.1525,4.7077,6.6545,3.941,0.5819,5.8724,3.717,4.9916,0.0926,4.0726,1.8629,2.6823,2.9025,5.1914,5.0946,0.2398,2.5153,0.0007,4.9907,4.7398,5.3659,0.3327,3.0781,2.8577,0.2473,5.1408,0.8577,0.0012,4.7016,5.5268,0.0762,5.6622,5.6139,1.6024,6.8079,0.4087,0.7454,6.2458,1.6456,2.3712,2.9743,1.0932,1.8478,1.8646,3.3882,3.823,3.1578,2.7875,3.2439,1.8694,5.0726,1.1807,1.2566,4.0467,4.5389,1.2659,0.8002,1.0276,0.0002,5.3127,2.7129,5.7849,3.144,0.1555,0.0002,4.5765,0.4344,0.0654,0.1563,2.3359,0.0013,0.0683,0.0002,2.6057,0.9433,0.1032,0.081,0.0002,1.5343,0.8029,2.6486,0.2647,3.2519,1.6372,3.9481,5.1121,1.6192,5.0933,3.0209,1.4416,5.2009,1.0297,2.2463,5.1193,1.3952,1.9666,1.0282,4.6123,1.5986,0.9755,2.5711,3.1071,4.9031,0.1852,2.1449,2.1564,4.9537,2.8572,1.4232,0.8227,3.7062,2.7545,0.5341,0.0002,1.2875,6.1447,5.5884,2.941,2.1886,2.9477,4.1663,0.5267,5.034,4.8952,1.8523,5.2902,0.3319,5.5245,5.4909,1.791,5.4092,0.0002,4.4314,3.0746,0.2642,5.0543,0.0034,0.6988,3.7741,0.0064,0.4159,2.1844,0.3231,1.4982,0.8826,4.216,2.9328,2.5592,5.377,3.6217,3.9979,0.3763,1.3537,6.1296,4.3472,4.8516,4.1133,0.5477,3.1161,2.7493,5.1771,2.9734,5.648,2.0968,0.9989,4.3495,1.2411,2.0574,3.8924,0.7353,3.8422,6.7846,1.8111,0.6326,1.3999,1.4828,4.9941,0.6662,5.0804,1.0761,1.7865,5.4504,4.0032,1.3929,0.5228,1.1232,2.0646,4.822,0.6685,5.0689,1.0993,1.8997,3.2601,6.2206,4.1396,4.4481,2.677,2.8384,5.2796,1.7807,6.2112,4.5654,3.1862,1.9061,1.14,5.1025,1.8525,1.4816,4.0241,5.1208,0.0001,2.0321,3.9925,2.4644,1.6635,2.4749,0.4356,0.4489,4.7437,1.073,5.9135,3.5608,1.6559,3.0923,1.3434,0.0002,2.1532,4.7139,2.7554,4.9107,6.0092,2.6773,1.1573,3.1011,4.9147,3.1157,1.8796,5.446,1.0286,4.3314,0.0085,3.8486,1.3889,4.2461,5.8728,2.3381,0.0423,0.3806,0.0002,1.3482,5.8448,1.2588,3.4097,3.1806,4.463,2.7776,1.9208,1.1179,4.9349,5.6323,5.2746,1.7366,2.1067,1.7946,3.0843,0.4613,0.8392,5.2431,1.8436,1.8766,1.9611,2.3115,2.0113,4.6658,2.8844,4.977,0.1305,0.127,6.2668,2.5948,2.5329,5.433,3.1834,0.2588,1.921,0.0522,0.6377,0.2057,2.1655,4.1706,5.2784,0.5849,2.2614,1.7757,1.4803,2.7978,4.3313,0.4447,3.19,3.1038,2.2925,0.8031,5.7015,0.9669,2.97,3.24,1.1777,2.2551,2.2286,4.3661,0.8856,2.5506,1.4901,1.8553,1.9534,1.0672,0.1547,3.4593,6.7351,3.9733,1.0369,0.3843,1.0987,0.3822,0.0002,4.6158,0.0083,0.1348]}
{"id":2644,"ended":false,"length":436,"gen_text":"Within the disability categories the athletes still need to be divided according to level of impairment. The classification systems differ from sport to sport and are intended to open up sports to as many different treatments as possible. This is true whether or not the athlete is disabled by accident or because of disability. These different classification systems also allow for those to be classified as severely disabled or moderately disabled as well as those who are on the 'good condition' lists due to injuries.\n\nThe classification system of the International Paralympic Committee (IPCC) has many different categories for the disability category. The World Lifestyle Sports Classification (WSL) classification gives the athlete classified as severely disabled. To the extent that he is disabled on a particular list, this type of category would be classified as normal or severe. The disability category is defined by the World Lifestyle Sports classification system and is the same in the IOC as it is in the U.S. There are also category changes for the category of severe disabled which could change, depending on an individual's circumstances and the athlete's needs. The classification system of the World Lifestyle Sports Classification (WSL) system is designed to include and exclude a variety of categories for some disabilities. These changes are based on the World Lifestyle Sports (WSL) system criteria (which the IOC does not define as disability) and, depending on the athlete, may only include certain conditions.\n\nThe IOC is expected to finalise the international classification and provide the players with a list on which the IOC should change the categories based on a body of research as they find further studies appropriate. The IOC will also consult with professional athletes at local and international level about their needs.\n\nMore information about specific categories and their criteria can be found on the WSL classification webpage www.openglobalgroup.org.\n\nThe IOC is a charity in support of sport and support of the disabled, where any donation or participation in sport provides a tangible benefit to an individual or a organization. All donation or participation is subject to the strictures of the WSL. Contributions should be directed to an appropriate recipient or group using:\n\na) http:\/\/www.openglobalgroup.org\/wls\n\nb) http:\/\/www.openglobalgroup.org\/other\n\nThe IOC's guidelines can be found at www.openglobalgroup.org for further information regarding all of the WSL's criteria.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2015.

{"id":641,"ended":true,"length":487,"gen_text":"Polka Party! received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Allmusic reviewer Eugene Chadbourne gave the album three stars and wrote that `` just about anyone could feel let down by this album... I couldn't believe the way that somebody would say that the album was great for \u00a0them and make it their top 5''.\n\nRough-counters\n\nIt\ufffds hard to categorize an album that is so easily dismissed as being without its roots. As one critic wrote to me,\n\nThese are the main reasons why this record is so popular. The second reason is that it was created by the Beatles. The first reason was that it was difficult to find a group that would be able to get a majority of songs into the top 10 songs. A few of the songs may have made it into the list, but the more difficult it was to find group with the most love songs... it wasn't a great album to start from, considering the amount of work involved. As far as I can tell however, the album is one of those rare things where you are at ease with a solo album. I couldn\ufffdt stop loving it and I can feel confident doing so now.\n\nAnother one of the most important aspects of your album is how it is written. The story of Paul McCartney and the Beatles, this is also the central narrative in the Beatles' greatest hits. It is said that 'the story of the Beatles is the story of the song we were talking about'. The same is true of this album. They could never live as they did and so far that is where the story gets to come from. By making these songs about their time with the Beatles, McCartney and their writing and writing the rest of the Beatles on this track, makes this album a lot more personal at the beginning. It has all the emotional baggage which was so prominent in 'Don't Know'. It has all the things that you will associate with the time spent with the Beatles (I found them at the bottom of the list where this quote comes from with regards to 'Don't Know'). It is certainly one of the things that have kept me playing with it for over twenty years at this point... even if it did turn you into a rock star (or at least a rock star you would not be if it were not for The Beatles).\n\nI cannot think of any album that is more entertaining to watch than this one. Thank you to all of us who support The Beatles!\n\nSee you next time.","token_len":509,"entropy":[8.3849,8.8633,7.5722,11.9052,7.9304,9.2156,2.8179,1.4259,1.5569,3.4472,1.6947,6.6505,10.6598,8.1239,8.6075,9.2861,6.5162,4.8684,1.1074,3.2461,4.5311,0.7436,2.2023,4.1509,1.9236,12.158,11.0552,3.5638,3.664,2.69,5.4045,8.028,0.036,0.6831,1.4412,0.6443,4.5231,3.0105,4.993,0.0045,1.8306,2.3113,3.2184,2.8134,6.7687,1.9332,2.4185,1.4172,2.4211,1.6106,0.9223,4.8466,4.3601,6.3006,0.5688,4.1342,2.2882,5.551,2.4091,2.8673,3.7841,3.0779,9.9098,2.0706,3.8552,5.4384,3.4917,5.7027,5.547,2.8334,3.7749,0.0004,4.5559,6.2527,0.0143,1.8825,0.1986,5.6249,0.0593,4.047,0.1372,2.2406,2.141,1.8527,5.6381,2.5333,0.8567,2.9792,5.588,3.8501,2.9809,0.639,4.3749,3.4641,2.3984,2.2828,3.5811,2.4875,0.6227,3.9319,0.0008,5.3959,1.9288,1.2814,5.6646,2.3043,0.4956,2.8495,3.2725,1.0724,1.0403,2.3116,1.4264,2.0034,5.7947,0.7093,0.3776,0.7248,1.3972,2.7554,3.7008,1.46,2.9435,4.5582,1.3854,1.6237,3.0523,0.2615,2.0758,0.915,2.3009,0.6815,5.6866,0.6148,2.3493,1.2104,3.5444,1.0769,2.8971,2.9454,1.2274,0.0048,3.9384,2.9115,5.4306,0.1807,4.5831,3.8737,0.9974,2.7504,1.2624,4.0379,1.2951,5.0242,2.7911,1.9552,0.619,0.5688,6.029,0.9675,4.133,0.5619,1.2952,0.3097,4.6589,1.1524,0.179,2.2897,5.5253,4.0334,1.4889,0.7034,0.3383,0.4154,6.618,5.136,1.5549,2.8221,5.8021,2.5075,5.481,3.2417,3.4184,0.9816,2.9067,2.6224,0.875,2.5175,2.4319,3.8938,2.1049,5.9007,1.4637,3.228,0.009,3.4752,2.8029,0.5998,4.3951,3.7989,0.0045,2.1108,1.1295,0.0929,7.2397,0.103,1.6884,2.2505,1.5594,3.4213,0.261,2.6947,3.165,4.0301,2.2133,1.5314,3.5527,5.0876,3.8102,1.0479,3.522,5.8694,1.5404,1.1932,3.0716,4.9017,0.2626,0.0011,3.6921,3.3341,0.8691,2.1763,2.3294,3.3032,4.3865,4.2788,5.5409,0.6914,2.3294,0.5858,1.1771,0.0005,4.7036,4.2012,0.3902,0.5682,2.7758,2.9313,3.3494,0.4292,6.2578,1.4516,0.4282,2.07,1.0911,2.9616,3.1642,0.4627,2.4278,4.6319,1.2609,4.6579,0.4964,1.8207,1.5419,0.5918,3.5226,5.3792,1.0559,4.937,1.56,5.4663,5.1709,2.4743,0.8841,3.3086,2.3091,4.4204,2.3506,0.8627,2.4657,1.1418,3.7807,0.192,5.3047,2.0326,3.6489,0.554,1.2769,0.1955,1.4401,1.8283,0.898,0.0582,1.0981,5.4365,4.7452,4.0263,4.6681,0.0097,3.297,2.206,5.7123,1.8465,0.2976,0.8134,2.2499,0.7616,0.9061,5.166,5.2417,3.7276,5.6809,5.1288,2.3616,0.8475,2.3748,3.6822,6.0142,4.172,0.9519,2.7779,1.0639,2.1358,3.8546,4.1293,5.0248,0.4508,0.2241,5.8034,4.1446,3.6602,0.5075,3.4308,3.1502,2.993,1.6686,0.6462,0.2373,0.7116,4.7239,1.7131,3.3568,5.6205,3.6476,2.5677,2.8753,3.8602,0.1062,0.4724,0.7844,5.9495,1.2759,5.6186,0.8009,6.2857,2.0909,0.6166,2.0251,3.788,0.5164,3.0376,7.0803,0.9708,3.5049,1.0216,2.1357,3.716,3.8389,0.4185,4.5069,3.4017,5.0934,3.5268,2.4104,4.8649,0.4201,3.8129,4.5271,0.8086,5.2351,3.2007,1.8448,2.1432,1.036,0.1324,4.3399,0.623,2.434,4.4263,5.9684,0.1883,1.4632,4.1562,2.8285,0.7088,0.638,0.2127,4.5268,4.5287,5.6221,3.1615,3.6867,1.4542,4.9156,0.1179,0.628,0.7468,6.2095,4.9736,6.588,1.6925,0.1534,6.4661,3.7603,0.0137,2.83,2.4863,0.0408,0.1928,0.8597,1.3546,1.5266,5.9545,2.2674,0.1514,0.2502,4.2495,0.5567,5.3314,3.3361,1.5393,4.5768,2.4559,2.7852,1.8133,3.3678,3.8043,0.0583,6.1055,0.7802,0.3069,3.8849,4.782,1.7808,1.2976,4.316,4.9068,3.6137,1.8883,0.4209,3.2597,1.3338,4.3861,3.0412,2.0097,0.1001,1.2214,1.3539,0.6017,3.8947,1.8697,3.1509,2.2646,1.4699,2.2549,2.6719,0.5487,0.1783,4.9996,0.1601,0.8801,0.9952,0.0004,3.0128,4.6065,3.386,0.0359,1.5486,2.2105,0.6916,2.059,1.5861,5.4581,1.6343,2.9408,1.514,0.9601,0.8333,0.4069,5.9219,0.0903,1.7808,1.2069,1.4554,3.745,0.7232,4.9558,2.9738,0.0381,2.5437,1.2321,0.0005,5.1915,0.7384,1.4283,0.8937,2.1066]}

Cleghorn and Archibald Scott Cleghorn, U.S.A. < ri_u_r_a_o_p_r_m> < unk >.\n\nThe petition asks the Supreme Court to consider whether the Court's ruling on the Defense of Marriage Act violates due process of law.\n\n\"The Supreme Court correctly recognizes that the constitutionality of federal recognition of same-sex marriage is not unique to North Carolina and the U.S., but we are not persuaded that Congress should make this determination solely for legal purposes,\" Klayman said. \"We are convinced that our state's recognition of same-sex marriage may be more beneficial than our federal recognition of the federal government's recognition of the same-sex couple as members of the U.S. family.\"\n\nThe petition, filed late Friday, asks the Court to adopt a unanimous majority decision.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts said, \"We are very much focused on making sure that the public's rights in this case are respected. We feel confident that the State's claim to this matter is robust enough to withstand a strong federal court challenge.\"\n\nHe added, \"The case continues to hinge on whether courts will rule on this question, and whether there will be a strong federal mandate to recognize same-sex couples as individuals and marriages as a result of the federal recognition of same-sex couples in North Carolina.\"\n\nUnder Florida's Constitution, North Carolina is a state within the Florida Constitution and will not be a federal jurisdiction.

On January 9, Burke earned the honor after going 12-12 with a season-high 18+ points.\n\nThe 6'9\" offensive specialist from Ohio State spent the previous three seasons with the Atlanta Hawks, Denver Nuggets and Dallas Mavericks. He is ranked No. 15 among NBA draft prospects by Sports Illustrated. During his four seasons at the team he played in three Pro Bowls, four All-Star Games and nine All-Star Game seasons for the New Orleans Saints. His seven season with the Denver Nuggets set the franchise standard for pure offensive ability with nine Pro Bowl appearances and seven All-Star appearances with the Broncos. Burke's seven Pro Bowl appearances included nine seasons with Denver's New Orleans Pelicans (2010-11).\n\nPrior to his time with the Nuggets Burke played four seasons as a guard for Atlanta, Washington and the Dallas Mavericks. He left his former team in 2014 as a backup to former GM Jerry Sloan, so some of the other teams who had dealt with Burke, including New Orleans and Dallas, have followed suit.\n\n\"I never had a relationship with Jerry. I think his attitude was really just very, very good,'' Burke said of Adams' agent. \"I'd rather get something done on the court and feel good about it than do anything to put myself in an unfair position. I thought he had always done what he wanted.\"\n\nAccording to Burke, he was a little more concerned as he watched James Harden play against the Mavericks, but it wasn't until after the Rockets lost that he started learning to handle it better.\n\n\"I was the one who had him on our team, and when this game went on I didn't even think twice about making a trade to get him,\" Burke said of that season with the Hawks. \"He's playing well. I just felt that it wasn't the right situation for him at the moment.\n\n\"I told James and he's been saying it for a long time, that we could bring him in today, that we could pull him over until we got him. That's the way I felt when I signed with Dallas that year. I definitely feel like I'm moving ahead with what I'm doing with this team. If I had one more trade to put in for another player, that would be it, but we're going to make it now.

{"id":3634,"ended":false,"length":446,"gen_text":"There are Biblical episodes referencing Ashdod but they remain uncorroborated by archaeological finds : Upon Joshua's conquest of the Promised Land, Ashdod was allotted to the Tribe of Judah ( Book of Joshua, 2:1 ), which is mentioned in Joshua 3:12, 15:7 ( Moses 7:15 ), and also in the Mosaic law book of Judges 14:11. The latter describes how Joshua could not possess Jerusalem, while the former describes how Joshua could not enter the city and live inside of it.\n\nIt is reported that Joshua could have built a Temple at Jericho and placed it there. This would likely have been the place where Joshua would have lived ( Leviticus 37:10, 40; Numbers 8:5 ), which has since been completely lost with time. A few of the stories which have survived are found in the Bible ( see Joshua 4:4 ).\n\nJoshua 8:1 - 6 was also an account of a people that had fled from Egypt and came to the Lord. They left, and there returned to the land and built a city ( Joshua 4:5 ). The second story of a people that found a refuge in a wilderness also features this. A similar story from the third story of a people who found themselves exiled from Egypt by Joshua ( Joshua 8:1 ).\n\nIn Hebrew, one might also say, this was also the place where the city of Judah may have stood.\n\nJoshua 2:8 - 9 was written by God on the mountain where there was a fire of fire at noon on the sixth day, when that deity was called to prepare for the coming of the Messiah, and to come out at midnight and take food of all the people ( Joshua 2:8, 15-17 ).\n\nJoshua 2:5 - 6 is also the place where Moses did his pilgrimage into Egypt, which is where the two stories of Joshua 2:8 are based: the first where Moses had to walk from Jericho to Jerusalem ( Joshua 2:5 ), and the second where he was ordered out of the land and back to the city of Moses ( Joshua 2:6 ).\n\nJoshua 2:9 - 10 was written at the place of David until Jerusalem was destroyed ( Joshua 2:8 ).\n\nNote that Joshua 2:9 - 9 was also the area where Judah lost all its lands. The entire book of Exodus describes the events described in Joshua 3:18 - 19 and Joshua 2:10 - 13.\n\nSee Also.\n\nReferences","token_len":512,"entropy":[3.4462,13.6789,8.8093,9.7302,8.9002,4.4637,0.0483,6.035,2.315,7.4475,4.6928,5.184,0.9429,0.0018,0.0015,4.1849,6.5728,4.7382,9.9492,10.9724,10.5631,0.2969,5.4083,0.3229,2.1649,5.8377,0.0034,0.0012,0.5662,3.7682,0.2095,0.004,1.3423,8.9,1.0149,1.3828,7.6978,0.3185,1.3157,3.0592,10.2392,1.6538,3.2126,3.0698,2.4337,0.2216,2.5201,3.0829,2.1972,2.4961,3.9539,0.7735,3.0414,2.9753,0.1643,3.1895,4.1578,4.0917,1.6874,3.5348,3.3024,5.4271,3.0218,0.0312,3.5624,1.5772,1.2995,3.5204,0.5567,2.0419,5.7512,0.011,1.8189,2.5609,2.1793,2.4906,3.7908,0.074,3.2795,2.1732,2.2174,5.3069,5.2682,2.7156,1.4695,4.9076,2.1877,5.6242,5.5556,1.6897,3.9179,0.5196,0.8535,1.0946,0.4084,1.2501,0.7902,0.5253,3.6044,1.2399,1.1432,2.8862,4.8298,6.5244,2.6952,0.289,0.7868,2.0274,0.1538,4.4797,0.5398,5.4033,0.4295,1.685,3.829,2.3685,3.2741,0.949,4.8248,3.119,1.5923,2.5139,5.005,1.0,1.8864,2.1598,2.3111,2.1067,5.2584,0.7971,1.3186,2.4416,2.6831,0.6921,1.1936,1.5793,0.7567,2.8514,3.8035,3.6563,0.1007,0.0011,5.4306,0.0767,3.3306,3.8739,3.0452,3.1195,2.2845,3.7884,0.0082,3.4081,2.4215,2.6805,4.4405,5.4165,0.1791,5.3952,2.1867,6.4618,3.7317,0.6097,4.7223,3.7187,3.0475,0.3283,3.1268,4.681,2.0534,2.5137,2.1727,4.9768,0.2427,1.0048,2.8049,2.355,4.8296,4.1375,2.956,0.0235,3.2342,2.4009,1.0543,0.0002,3.0235,5.1052,0.2192,2.4031,2.4729,4.83,5.1286,3.3903,3.7915,5.1302,0.2143,1.7512,5.5328,2.3999,2.3205,4.6022,1.0758,3.4114,1.8586,3.8288,0.2276,1.3003,4.7421,1.6559,3.5676,5.2076,5.9643,1.592,4.6011,5.4776,1.1083,1.7629,0.9496,4.4399,3.402,0.5197,1.8765,2.2465,1.7688,3.2641,0.0044,2.1953,0.5676,2.1565,5.1033,2.2335,2.2722,2.576,0.9593,0.9819,5.5389,1.4422,5.6177,0.7935,1.9995,3.3623,4.8034,4.9987,2.9475,3.0157,4.0082,3.2539,0.5663,4.7394,1.2527,5.0098,1.0862,1.1882,0.779,0.6834,2.2383,2.5251,4.945,6.1313,1.0245,1.9301,3.3165,1.9952,2.3359,0.3732,2.1476,0.0054,2.1369,1.1241,0.893,0.0002,3.2089,4.6548,0.7804,5.6933,3.3885,2.6848,1.8522,2.1009,5.3394,1.9461,4.3507,1.0992,0.3735,0.3303,1.9306,5.5957,0.6871,3.3457,5.8266,0.104,2.7127,0.8637,1.6636,0.0002,2.2298,3.7984,0.0789,3.1224,0.7857,1.583,1.7561,3.6715,2.3271,4.1717,4.0516,0.8451,4.6482,3.8854,4.135,1.0495,0.5633,5.0029,3.8564,0.6938,5.0659,5.0732,1.9039,0.4613,4.1848,0.0616,2.6309,2.7187,6.0282,5.7319,1.9298,3.1442,2.1505,3.9568,2.0356,0.6729,1.5847,0.0996,0.2613,2.3383,2.4748,1.366,3.3446,4.516,2.6396,4.7236,2.3575,3.2435,4.4639,5.5612,3.4535,2.6775,0.6394,1.0254,2.358,0.6333,0.3737,0.0039,1.4497,4.638,3.9578,3.1365,1.3284,0.5165,0.8627,0.0002,2.0427,1.2514,0.0126,4.7534,0.5077,1.0797,1.3932,1.6077,1.8279,1.8218,0.1632,3.5233,5.661,2.1989,4.7741,4.6749,1.9629,1.8428,2.3577,1.3866,3.7308,1.4181,5.1209,4.3047,0.8269,1.2964,1.3494,0.1619,0.8207,2.8367,2.3073,4.5661,3.0579,1.8192,5.1583,1.0433,3.9503,1.4979,3.5466,3.9203,3.4591,0.4142,1.985,2.1723,0.5149,0.0568,0.0027,1.3726,0.6838,0.6119,0.2083,0.0854,0.1538,0.8172,2.3108,4.4756,4.2761,0.3091,0.9139,1.7274,1.735,4.6578,0.5595,1.2399,2.0688,1.2258,6.0709,0.9712,0.1321,0.0243,0.0023,0.7636,0.4835,0.4904,0.0002,1.6914,0.6165,0.0132,2.1062,0.5449,1.0555,1.9246,0.8463,4.0257,0.9839,2.7246,2.1418,4.0762,6.9954,5.9243,0.4249,1.4246,1.3046,0.1779,0.0307,0.0026,4.4751,1.0565,0.5331,0.0002,5.2036,0.6681,2.3852,0.624,0.0225,1.0667,1.8117,3.1232,1.754,2.3257,1.2829,6.8168,0.2805,5.1722,4.1369,3.5398,0.9918,4.0164,1.9022,2.2198,5.7259,3.7155,0.3972,3.2091,2.8851,1.4918,3.8739,3.9218,0.4654,0.7463,4.3012,0.1037,4.0386,2.0561,1.8032,2.4571,2.5931,1.615,0.0013,1.8207,0.4827,3.1014,1.6337,0.729,0.0002,4.3637,2.8544,7.206,0.646,0.0002,2.0106]}
{"id":533,"ended":false,"length":481,"gen_text":"Season 3 premiered on May 13, 2012 after vague details surfaced about the show's spring return on the Twitter account of sister wife Robyn Sullivan Brown. The twenty one episode season mainly revolves around three episodes that are the center of the group's relationship. The trio begins their journey in June with Rona and Kelli, although Kelli's new-couple status is not a part of the show's development.\n\n\"With this season, [showrunner] [Martin] Auerbach is using a little more subtle and much less sensationalistic elements to tell the story of what actually happened in the show, and how we're gonna have two major endings with one ending and the other ending,\" Kelli explained recently. It was announced at the E3 press conference the premiere of Season 3 may be happening now.\n\nBoth Rona and Kelli's relationship has been in turmoil in the show's first two seasons. In Season 4, during the first half of Season 5, Rona had left, and Kelli had a contract with the show's parent TV channel. Kelli left for Season 6 with a $4,000 raise in salary, but Kelli later left for Season 7 on a $2,000 raise.\n\n\"To me, there was no real ambiguity [in the way we handled the characters],\" Kelli revealed. \"What's great about the way the characters moved is...there's been such a wide range of character development and personalities from one season to the next.\"\n\nRona and Kelli currently live in Sturgis, Ohio, after being divorced in Season 4, and are having a baby due next month. At present the couple does not have a significant place in the household due to the ongoing drama on both their kids' heads. \"We're still at the beginning stages of a family where we are living together, I don't think we're able to go any farther than that yet,\" Kelli said. \"But we're just so grateful for what she's coming back with.\"\n\nWhile many fans of the series have come to their senses during the first two seasons, the series ultimately seems to end in a happier ending. \"There's absolutely something for everybody about it, and that's really rare with how we wrap our head around it,\" Kelli continued. \"So it's great to try and continue those twists and turns that we've come to think of as the show's conclusion, because there's absolutely nothing to see now that ends in a happy ending.\"","token_len":512,"entropy":[6.2587,10.9231,0.6421,3.3174,3.5029,0.5553,2.4463,6.4174,13.8551,4.0842,4.3509,1.2541,1.0069,2.4672,0.3267,9.0457,6.8021,4.8609,2.5686,7.5118,1.4566,1.008,9.0471,9.6734,6.7239,0.4276,9.522,9.2658,0.4619,1.9688,10.4783,6.1944,2.8142,2.3961,11.2288,2.3458,0.0039,5.8646,4.1136,2.349,2.5757,3.9878,5.0586,0.5226,0.9984,6.438,0.6275,3.6257,1.0206,1.7495,4.9719,4.5266,1.376,1.9682,2.5297,6.1612,2.9368,6.5247,4.7523,2.2157,5.4743,3.6553,2.3241,6.0312,2.8667,0.0018,2.6176,4.8624,4.9527,6.7618,0.2972,2.0359,1.8295,2.2783,3.6242,3.9815,0.0064,0.3532,3.0608,1.3483,4.6025,0.8268,1.2605,0.0012,4.2965,5.5417,2.6359,2.1101,1.0876,5.3717,3.9522,0.248,0.6861,4.8946,5.2606,0.3139,5.3565,1.9115,0.0592,2.254,5.5296,2.1989,4.6107,2.0063,5.2875,3.856,5.2251,2.9558,5.5497,1.3539,2.8648,1.213,4.2165,1.2146,0.2476,0.6672,3.0003,5.1061,0.5606,1.8207,1.2019,2.2402,2.3132,1.417,2.6643,2.8908,3.0179,4.4763,4.5263,5.6317,5.784,5.1201,4.1712,3.9529,1.4817,2.2585,1.0197,0.0673,0.093,2.0671,4.3698,0.0206,2.5183,6.0756,0.803,6.3836,1.9601,4.9563,2.504,0.7024,4.3289,0.3847,1.5863,0.3949,5.2637,5.221,0.6213,1.7655,0.3286,6.6111,1.378,5.1287,5.1759,1.2558,0.6043,0.0002,5.789,2.1832,0.024,0.1627,0.0799,0.0004,2.7819,1.6944,2.4617,0.7662,3.5299,2.7579,2.6402,0.7159,4.5232,0.2778,1.1132,1.8475,0.1089,0.9089,2.0288,1.077,3.0202,0.2367,5.5669,1.2214,3.2187,2.286,0.0694,1.2164,1.2945,0.1856,1.4852,0.0106,3.7388,5.4224,5.4073,1.8489,0.4953,0.0004,1.8051,4.3672,5.0402,0.8572,1.8923,1.2881,2.5116,4.6384,7.2707,3.7176,1.4988,3.6575,0.0003,2.9055,3.3131,2.2182,0.2818,3.0794,1.3708,4.0644,3.9156,3.202,0.6103,3.2772,3.0588,2.1936,1.345,1.6308,2.5925,0.001,4.8596,2.4928,1.5628,0.156,0.041,4.8077,1.119,1.4033,2.1867,0.054,0.6593,0.5804,0.6564,1.5242,0.0003,1.9996,5.5161,1.7571,0.2859,3.6054,1.854,1.859,4.0409,5.3558,5.2136,2.116,1.3253,4.1436,2.0125,3.5269,1.4038,4.3779,0.8902,0.5154,0.0004,4.0434,0.6582,0.1775,4.626,2.6383,4.7774,0.6024,1.6262,3.6574,1.7761,2.0567,5.6629,2.5371,7.3673,3.9677,0.8044,5.7254,4.4582,0.5113,4.5143,1.4058,0.1828,4.022,1.738,2.4827,5.524,4.0524,2.424,1.1841,0.1337,0.1172,0.0094,2.2216,0.2162,0.0002,3.5293,0.0277,1.5334,0.0251,0.0006,5.8428,2.2043,0.55,5.0784,4.9338,0.1785,0.3098,4.0095,0.705,5.4024,3.4033,3.6751,1.9205,0.8992,1.7972,2.1821,1.243,3.1373,4.637,1.0151,1.9781,5.5621,4.2877,1.2874,0.1596,5.2528,4.3357,4.0989,1.79,3.4009,0.2085,0.413,0.8469,5.6205,5.2944,0.6512,0.3558,4.5575,3.389,0.0258,1.5058,4.0128,3.7109,3.9373,4.3612,3.1238,4.9419,0.5245,3.8207,0.2807,3.8202,1.6803,1.155,2.7854,4.6311,1.2035,1.7277,1.8648,0.3714,3.1505,4.0017,4.1662,0.9738,3.1349,3.7498,1.903,1.4448,5.6706,2.3619,0.0007,1.2896,1.3758,0.8793,4.1563,0.0073,3.5506,3.9242,2.7424,1.5461,0.466,4.8756,0.3167,0.6785,0.0005,1.2604,0.2543,0.9138,2.2902,1.4717,0.7097,3.4547,3.0653,3.1928,1.056,2.5096,4.6991,0.5492,6.1263,1.6395,0.8752,1.6273,0.247,0.0002,3.7237,4.6497,1.0148,3.1811,0.4563,1.3902,1.4879,4.6783,0.3971,4.5929,0.3408,4.0838,0.8989,2.8682,1.8082,0.1072,0.4297,2.1583,2.5394,5.8546,4.8411,0.2093,4.92,2.1407,1.0316,5.2148,0.3166,0.9367,1.6433,3.1008,0.8331,5.7101,3.8617,2.6926,1.6934,4.3978,1.8734,1.4501,1.3167,2.6854,0.3663,2.9201,6.2059,5.4256,6.0631,2.4478,5.0101,1.9614,3.1326,0.0073,1.2507,0.4556,0.5569,0.0007,2.2943,0.0475,0.1428,3.6067,2.299,0.5304,3.442,0.5002,6.7188,0.7846,4.8023,5.7337,5.6085,0.6527,0.2762,2.5197,0.8749,1.2974,3.4162,0.6388,4.9742,1.2403,0.8104,1.911,2.738,1.4045,5.5688,1.5446,2.8677,2.7513,0.3992,4.3467,1.3747,2.042,2.7427,5.2598,2.2742,4.7473,1.7323,0.6514,1.1712,0.1418,0.898]}

He would continue appearing in the playoffs to the great-greats, while he would leave the major leagues once he took part in the AFL draft. This was his final time coming and when the Hawks had not yet finished the 1963-64 season, he left for the American Basketball Association.\n\n\nAt the end of his career As a member of the Atlanta Blue Star Basketball Club he scored 42 points and finished with 852 on the season, only to go down with a torn ACL.\n\n\nIn 1987, As a member of the National Basketball Association he was asked to be the first female coach in NBA history when he became an Assistant Coach for the Green River Hawks from 2005-07.\n\n\nIn 1991 As part of his role in the Green River Hawks he was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame as the Hall of Fame Jazz Player.\n\n\nIn 1997 As part of his role in the Basketball Hall of Fame, he began representing the Golden State Warriors from 2004-07. He won two silver medals in the 1999 and 2000 Olympics in the women's basketball and men's basketball, and became the first female coach in NBA history to be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\n\nIn 2000 He retired from professional basketballing in 2005 due to a heart attack. Despite having had enough of being a self-proclaimed \"douchebag-player\" he decided to retire the year he retired from professional basketball, and as a result would end up becoming a full professor in his fourth year of teaching with an M.D.\/Law degree from the School of Management in Miami.\n\n\nIn 2007 He is the executive vice president for communications and communications at Tiger Enterprises. A member of the Board of Trustees of the Tiger Institute, he served for 35 years as an Advisor to President Bill Clinton's Presidential campaign during his first year of management in the White House. He currently serves as the President's Senior Advisor on the Global Challenge at Tiger Enterprises and the Board of Trustees of President Clinton's Presidential campaigns.\n\n\nWith over 80 years of experience he knows just how good he is, and who he is for sure. His most recent book, \"We Are All The Same... You are All One.\" will be released July 21.","token_len":513,"entropy":[2.3183,8.288,6.8133,0.2915,4.0593,0.6652,3.225,0.2121,1.9759,8.7012,7.1104,1.6239,0.0633,6.1316,4.0212,1.6609,1.586,1.6909,1.3747,2.4377,3.2753,0.0025,0.1938,0.2834,0.06,4.2913,0.7437,0.6234,0.0004,8.4753,0.4244,6.1758,5.3871,2.0534,7.043,1.1131,0.1034,6.5689,1.3434,4.5399,3.8422,1.4605,4.7286,2.0487,2.5921,1.9939,1.2707,0.7458,2.7547,0.6566,1.9905,4.8173,0.0012,1.4561,4.3099,2.81,4.2151,0.8602,0.5478,2.1671,1.5658,4.5063,7.3934,0.4837,1.2892,2.5675,4.3309,2.6276,4.853,5.6033,0.6383,1.6635,1.5327,4.2821,3.2872,1.7291,4.3254,1.3325,5.184,0.2454,5.9595,1.2973,5.4586,4.9648,0.0285,0.7367,5.3283,4.1208,0.4792,4.5161,1.6446,2.7746,2.1412,4.6955,6.6096,5.1817,5.1905,2.2701,4.8215,3.9756,4.4334,1.7099,4.2291,1.4786,5.6708,2.9843,0.2529,0.0829,0.3567,1.0579,2.7788,1.7972,1.2971,3.9289,3.6155,0.2117,1.3183,3.5059,0.0006,4.5818,1.0078,2.0464,0.0136,1.4936,0.828,8.2614,2.0294,2.7637,0.0288,0.1221,2.9201,6.7205,5.0772,4.2222,2.0598,2.7879,4.3292,4.5846,0.1551,1.667,4.1632,1.0071,4.5419,5.5121,4.2432,0.5736,0.7162,1.7699,5.367,3.0384,3.4001,1.3071,1.4177,0.5256,1.8724,0.9627,1.4066,2.6728,0.0005,2.2903,5.0865,1.0738,1.6908,1.0229,0.2618,0.0023,0.066,4.6735,0.2178,0.3056,1.1326,1.8862,5.4622,0.5545,3.1603,1.6591,2.2138,4.7817,2.8493,0.9833,2.7191,0.0313,4.1907,0.856,2.9366,3.5525,4.5242,0.4467,1.8683,0.296,5.3563,5.8837,1.4045,4.5024,4.7727,0.4471,1.5287,0.2529,1.9449,0.0004,1.5083,2.8649,1.7913,5.0781,0.0012,1.4529,3.9492,2.8568,0.5469,3.0524,0.0139,0.2735,1.2521,1.2676,2.0929,0.0008,0.1107,0.0339,1.3312,0.0109,0.0121,0.0012,3.1451,1.3627,5.9059,0.1314,0.1777,5.2348,1.4638,0.6656,0.9104,0.0003,0.8493,2.5748,0.8626,1.1172,0.0007,0.2709,0.1096,0.5726,0.1012,4.3976,0.0865,0.0069,0.0038,2.9436,0.6343,5.7502,5.9054,0.6055,3.7584,0.0401,0.0089,4.9163,3.5139,0.1325,1.3962,0.7689,1.9014,2.6508,2.4012,5.2527,0.2869,1.7468,0.8194,5.1612,1.9852,0.7799,1.3322,2.2691,0.961,2.9133,0.005,1.7815,2.2895,1.6945,0.001,0.2979,2.5499,1.5597,4.0918,0.6363,0.351,1.8127,1.5407,0.9074,0.7188,0.0206,0.2443,2.094,0.6689,0.0008,0.2664,0.0484,0.7389,0.0164,0.0088,0.0009,0.4722,0.5804,0.0002,0.687,1.9358,4.1158,3.388,0.4559,2.6822,0.2427,6.8009,2.5576,3.6118,4.1307,0.0065,1.7251,1.7421,0.933,0.4606,6.0133,3.5511,3.9814,4.9169,1.3147,2.5359,1.9098,5.9407,0.2426,2.0253,2.2329,4.6534,3.8726,0.0093,0.1824,6.5139,4.3955,1.3383,1.0255,2.7491,0.1613,1.7045,4.8414,3.0952,2.4907,1.2244,1.3446,1.1659,0.0836,3.1388,2.4767,3.8545,1.4916,0.502,5.5552,4.729,0.9501,4.0155,1.3662,3.7427,5.2452,2.3693,2.6094,4.5276,0.1561,1.2459,0.8599,5.0138,3.7836,4.5424,0.5248,2.6041,5.5657,5.8945,1.3184,1.5509,1.5829,5.2831,0.0307,4.1814,2.784,5.371,0.8301,0.8424,0.0003,0.7475,2.1377,2.3155,4.5764,1.6914,5.953,1.3062,0.0618,2.5109,3.6117,1.293,2.0074,1.5159,6.1523,5.2311,1.4894,5.0907,2.2243,0.0059,0.1966,2.8555,0.0568,1.7312,0.0017,0.6075,1.067,1.9719,4.4823,1.1257,0.491,2.9215,3.6888,4.9615,0.0479,0.5136,2.6014,4.6723,0.3621,2.8756,1.602,0.8645,2.7967,1.6696,2.8891,5.0344,1.4222,2.4089,2.02,2.1577,5.4248,2.8035,1.0629,0.4029,0.0006,0.2785,1.4836,4.328,0.2987,0.2783,1.5597,1.6578,0.5057,2.7144,1.6206,3.0875,1.4816,4.3621,5.7411,4.2426,1.0041,1.1299,2.0787,2.7159,4.0738,0.6588,0.5218,0.0059,0.2027,8.3083,1.8204,0.0412,0.6064,4.2054,0.3309,0.6817,0.0003,5.2982,2.9074,4.5632,0.4766,0.1944,1.4221,3.3089,5.1264,4.8251,0.6264,5.1098,2.8892,0.641,2.3946,0.8267,5.4769,0.6362,0.7423,3.9631,3.6579,0.4003,3.2537,4.3691,0.6617,0.5991,0.944,1.4188,5.8792,1.7783,1.7439,3.0201,0.3628,5.9691,5.2729,3.204,1.369,2.2548,2.4961,3.1,0.0996,0.8463,4.61,3.7964,2.289]}

{"id":1251,"ended":false,"length":476,"gen_text":"While Leigh made Streetcar in 1951, Olivier joined her in Hollywood to film Carrie, based on the controversial novel Sister Carrie ; although the film was plagued by troubles, Olivier received warm reviews and won praise in its praise. The production of the film followed suit and, in 1958, she was cast as the title character in the film starring Anne Hathaway, in which Henry Ford ( played by George Clooney ) played Robert Downey Jr.. This was her first time leading and she was given a role opposite Charles Mingus on the original TV series, where she appeared on it.\n\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Edward Carradine (played by Charles Mingus) became the first American movie director for Paramount Pictures to make the movie with a cast of cast of cast and crew:\n\nThe screenplay by Christopher Nolan, which was written while in the midst of filming in England, tells the story of a group of people who make the decisions about who and what to give up after their deaths, and there's a dark and confusing ending. It's based on some of the darkest days of the '60s, when men in black hats went to the hospital looking for their loved ones and were found not to be alive. This is based on the novel by Christopher Nolan, where Edward Carradine is played by Christopher Nolan. The screenplay was written by Christopher Nolan and is presented in the form of a short story, featuring an unnamed young boy who falls for the narrator's brother, who's the same age as him. The film stars a young Elizabeth Banks, with Christopher Reeve played by Colin Farrell, and Ian McKellen-Ewan playing Vincent Price II. Carradine's character, Vincent Price II, the late director of Streetcar, is played by Paul Newman. The film starts at the beginning of the film and ends upon returning to Earth after escaping from Paris during World War II, where he's presumed dead. At this point, Vincent Price II leaves the city after losing his head. The plot thickens with the return of Max Martin, played by Anthony Hopkins. This is written for the role of Vincent Price II when Max had become a prisoner after the outbreak at World War Two, the only person left in the building after the outbreak.

{"id":3312,"ended":true,"length":501,"gen_text":"From Harrisville, NY 812 travels north through an area of Pitcairn and Fowler. This area contains numerous small lakes and rivers and is predominantly rural in nature. Within Fowler, the route travels along North St. John St. to Coney Island. During winter there is abundant snow in the lower half of the town. On this day the riders will pass a boat park, play a couple of river crossings, and find that the lake has become wet. As the evening progresses and the day progresses further south, the route crosses a beach and falls to where it leads. This course will lead to a stream or lake that leads to the road that will link the trailhead with the shoreline. This is the home of the old village school where we are most active with a weekly bike ride of over an hour to meet our family. The creek to the north is fairly small in comparison to our home in Pitsville but it is easy to follow and fairly flat. The narrow trail and low tide give the trail its name, meaning that it is not steep nor fast. Just follow the trail head down the watercourse. At the end of the trail you will see a stream and on the way out from the trailhead you will find that you are about 5 miles from your village. From there you can use the old gravel road through the lake to your south, which will lead you into the swamp district. After your bike ride, stay put along with us on the river bank and visit the area where we grew up. The trail is over a two mile wide, approximately 1 mile deep. As the afternoon walks begin and finish, the route winds for a couple of miles through the swamp district. During the first half of season, it is easy to see the forest from you house and in the evening this forest should fade away at the beginning of the winter. We ride a waterwheel that turns when cold weather strikes and is easy to enjoy. All we need to do to make time on this trail is to ride over a shallow or shallow lake in a shady manner. If you wish to enjoy the river, you can start any time we meet using the wooden skis that we use on the trailhead. It is a great place to park and it is very easy to see that you are doing something right about the beginning of a forest path. We would like to thank all of the people riding this trail who have helped us along and gave their enthusiasm for this project. Thank you to our local trail builders and volunteers for making sure we can continue this project.","token_len":517,"entropy":[10.5535,5.2101,0.891,5.4138,6.8425,4.5578,24.5057,6.0721,3.4997,5.7333,1.4409,1.2028,12.0851,1.0207,0.003,2.7548,12.5665,3.0819,3.1953,2.2506,3.44,4.3734,3.8841,3.4957,1.0153,2.3079,2.3737,1.5871,7.577,5.7096,3.5972,0.9171,0.3102,6.7347,7.6985,0.6732,1.8536,5.4656,3.7471,2.3851,5.8872,4.6464,0.6877,3.383,3.3493,0.8535,2.6323,5.7703,2.7602,0.0434,1.6066,4.7782,3.6991,3.9358,0.6003,4.0058,1.4238,2.4825,0.4689,5.8869,4.3643,0.0396,0.2101,4.5373,0.9335,3.8155,3.6058,1.3319,2.0108,5.365,2.0326,3.2589,2.5532,6.1078,4.5269,2.0176,6.0367,1.7276,5.0539,0.1864,5.217,2.7569,0.738,0.8512,5.2455,4.5363,1.3046,3.4173,2.1318,3.2753,4.29,0.9485,4.0222,0.7573,4.7342,1.7163,3.5121,0.4979,4.0942,2.0868,2.2861,0.825,0.6045,0.5803,2.0596,3.5807,2.0592,5.5359,1.6777,4.2026,2.2515,6.6448,1.5012,5.7053,2.7766,2.7116,5.2908,2.739,3.7556,1.2159,1.4815,5.2366,4.2313,2.3802,2.2099,4.0405,0.6661,1.3291,5.4959,2.5904,3.0185,5.9505,0.9732,4.7289,1.4594,1.9768,0.5758,3.7822,0.737,0.5883,2.9695,1.4637,1.4836,6.0757,0.3066,1.1036,6.0531,5.7578,4.5266,2.9677,3.7839,3.3895,5.9462,3.1198,4.7757,2.8474,4.8987,5.358,1.0898,3.7387,4.3201,4.6598,0.0032,2.9702,5.0095,1.9313,2.7454,0.939,2.1493,5.9302,4.4133,0.6988,2.6756,1.2575,5.3134,4.082,3.4679,3.0694,0.295,4.263,2.8094,3.7985,4.4483,3.2984,0.5825,2.6591,1.8689,0.8174,5.0444,0.1207,3.0677,1.6206,5.9033,3.3899,0.7737,1.3527,6.0066,3.4183,4.831,4.2277,4.2972,4.3458,1.4621,1.6311,3.7669,1.848,2.8385,4.4144,2.1781,0.9345,1.152,2.9275,3.5654,4.8095,4.2447,1.0007,6.372,2.8738,0.4976,1.1072,4.5052,3.2804,1.6169,4.6077,4.9258,2.5406,3.286,0.7104,1.3728,0.1622,0.246,0.6112,1.3399,0.2151,2.1862,0.6722,4.8792,2.645,5.055,0.7672,2.8148,3.8036,4.4162,0.5128,1.7641,0.4928,0.9443,0.1449,2.123,3.1657,2.3534,1.8146,3.0839,4.2034,0.8466,1.0346,3.31,5.7951,1.0711,4.0862,2.1011,0.8824,2.055,4.3905,0.6178,5.051,5.8191,0.656,5.669,0.7167,3.5465,0.7881,3.4388,4.0853,3.093,2.521,1.9836,1.0803,1.172,3.6607,1.0108,5.4492,6.6581,0.6692,4.0763,4.1504,4.8729,0.3433,2.2825,5.4264,5.2336,3.7238,2.5835,2.503,1.4746,1.048,3.5945,2.5976,1.4463,5.2908,1.1684,5.2041,1.813,1.4356,3.6092,0.1032,0.4507,2.3862,2.1809,1.8192,5.2957,1.8338,4.9056,0.6582,2.7496,2.4702,5.3442,2.5725,1.3054,2.4779,1.6639,4.2156,1.717,3.8821,6.7184,4.4633,2.0586,4.8478,0.8775,1.5079,3.4904,4.6389,5.5455,1.7274,2.5899,0.1621,0.3949,2.8094,1.1995,1.3427,0.9699,1.0907,3.9043,0.5901,3.7594,2.0043,0.1088,7.729,1.1338,2.9242,1.0312,3.709,0.129,1.9424,1.2257,4.6576,3.1232,6.3683,4.5372,1.9016,5.0733,0.7426,3.5847,5.5695,2.6604,6.1655,4.5382,1.0219,5.3773,1.275,4.2462,0.175,0.756,3.461,0.3746,4.0259,4.0471,2.9403,5.055,2.96,3.5888,3.8287,4.7031,6.2244,3.6097,2.2745,1.1896,3.106,3.851,0.0964,5.5439,0.8465,5.5933,4.2935,0.8723,0.7586,0.1232,2.0313,2.8854,7.5789,3.0785,1.2184,1.1041,0.1908,1.14,2.7729,4.9101,1.6869,5.8243,5.8113,1.876,1.8544,3.5521,2.2732,5.5645,6.711,0.8295,3.6241,0.6585,3.2523,0.2581,3.9484,1.0608,2.9166,1.9313,1.4623,1.0323,5.5036,6.4684,1.9013,5.3299,5.162,6.6046,0.8237,5.6104,4.3173,1.2133,1.8433,1.4429,2.5573,2.0663,1.0849,1.3104,3.8637,0.3015,3.6227,0.3718,1.8735,1.9067,1.9225,0.1028,4.4871,1.6444,3.8271,0.4128,3.5027,1.314,0.0864,2.5798,4.5957,2.4402,0.81,5.1283,2.2653,1.3185,6.4711,1.0227,4.9255,0.1617,3.9072,5.9155,5.832,0.373,2.6731,4.0565,2.0874,0.0831,0.7081,2.4295,0.7782,1.3236,1.958,4.7506,1.7491,0.5488,1.3048,1.0741,2.0673,0.6642,2.38,3.5289,4.9439,2.1267,5.8063,1.1285,1.6953,3.0994,0.7682,4.213,0.0195,1.7702,2.5094,3.6931,4.3994,3.6736,1.4684,1.796,1.3371,2.8276,3.9944,1.3534,2.9859,1.5116,2.1583,2.4443,0.8286]}
{"id":1581,"ended":false,"length":491,"gen_text":"On July 24 a tropical disturbance behind Hurricane Hernan strengthened into a tropical depression. Due to the close proximity of Hernan to its west, the development of the depression was hindered due to the wind over the island in the Atlantic Ocean.\nIt was the strong front forcing the storm to move with heavy wind from the north, although it has not been moved to the easterwestward direction since the second tropical depression took place.\nWith this situation being of immediate concern after the tropical hurricane of October 2013, the development of the Tropical Depression continued to be hampered by weak winds and low-lying coastal areas in the south-central part of the country with few major inland channels of circulation and the potential to carry a maximum number of large hurricanes in circulation into the future with a potential number of hurricanes in future for use as a primary Category 5 hurricane hazard in coastal areas with small coastal population areas with negligible hurricane intensity or with little hurricane intensity in large inland channels that are vulnerable from a storm and are generally not inundated with large, well-heeled coastal communities with minimal storm activity.\nThe most important important development of the Central Atlantic hurricane activity was the wind pattern. The major wind patterns in tropical regions from the west to the east of the country were similar in magnitude from November 2013 to December 2015. These winds combined with weak tropical wind over the eastern part of the country made the development of the National Hurricane Center system capable of producing a maximum sustained hurricane category 5 hurricane activity in this country. This is especially important because due to the wind patterns over the two days ending on June 1, as well as due to the relatively high winds, large amount of storm force can be accumulated through the wind pattern during very high winds with a significant percentage of these wind patterns being located in areas on upper and lower mainland and the high wind levels are at the top of the central and western hemisphere. These types of wind patterns have a high probability of increasing in frequency depending on the frequency of different wind patterns that occur for different regions (Winds, V.W.-W.W.)\nDue to the winds generated by the winds of the tropical cyclones, the development of the tropical storm development zone, which was established on the ground in September 2018, took several years. This formation has a major role to play in maintaining stability of the tropical climate, particularly as its influence increases with its location. Additionally, the development of the tropical depression also had a major influence in reducing flooding on the southern coast of the country.\nThe following are some of the activities of the Central hurricane development zone:","token_len":519,"entropy":[7.612,3.5056,5.9014,10.1447,7.6422,10.0762,5.8944,6.5538,4.9885,1.3199,7.6576,2.7512,0.6477,1.849,2.9787,1.634,6.9524,0.03,1.1106,7.6641,0.4874,0.3501,3.2878,0.0069,0.0046,1.1177,4.0727,5.0441,3.3077,1.1866,6.656,0.6473,1.6754,5.8843,1.9075,5.9709,3.6274,0.0078,0.8476,5.4667,5.5958,1.1919,2.0382,4.4611,1.0359,5.0113,0.8792,0.5934,1.7361,9.1517,1.0893,3.7337,5.7285,6.3834,5.1672,0.9713,2.9096,0.7732,2.3255,5.2493,5.2666,3.1306,3.3908,0.7147,2.8262,2.1858,5.994,1.6615,4.8036,1.6875,1.4798,5.1026,2.971,0.7671,7.4023,0.0016,9.4517,4.0359,1.6085,1.6408,1.7827,5.7116,4.6757,1.5852,5.3757,0.4122,1.5924,0.8223,4.8476,3.1223,5.1922,3.6941,5.8461,5.2369,0.3273,6.7205,0.9001,3.1339,4.7575,3.7946,3.3852,3.6236,0.3233,1.1244,4.4991,0.1493,0.3278,5.3333,0.6517,5.6781,2.0608,1.7394,1.9275,0.954,4.6342,1.0794,1.4218,3.5654,3.1568,0.4643,3.2068,0.7116,3.0866,0.3949,2.9083,2.3667,2.0086,2.5234,0.0073,0.2645,1.6214,5.1265,3.7918,4.287,3.2171,5.4816,3.3889,2.4467,3.2665,3.0229,5.1332,1.7315,4.3606,2.6149,3.9516,4.1266,0.0102,2.996,2.8901,2.9054,6.0013,4.4049,0.3465,3.6291,5.6028,2.3462,2.149,5.1236,0.0247,3.2925,1.6992,3.8456,5.4495,5.6273,1.1409,1.4588,4.8047,5.7201,1.1598,0.5333,5.3479,2.4259,3.5349,0.1697,4.4115,5.003,2.3855,5.1613,2.5019,3.0257,6.149,3.6654,3.8639,3.8287,3.5011,4.2676,1.3495,0.4232,1.8883,4.9798,2.2832,1.6582,4.495,1.4518,4.4377,5.2325,2.1474,3.9941,4.7266,2.9514,5.4632,1.9529,4.9759,0.0029,2.0363,1.9663,4.5536,5.5494,0.4122,5.2037,0.0823,2.0754,2.1836,2.8195,3.3213,3.7273,1.7128,0.4588,0.4054,1.4792,4.9799,2.091,5.7287,3.3465,1.308,0.3372,4.8309,3.2287,1.556,3.9058,1.6658,0.7494,6.1385,4.7738,3.1508,1.6405,5.4457,2.3925,1.7214,2.0449,4.1575,3.3461,4.6393,1.17,2.4781,1.0847,0.1724,0.441,2.9144,0.2801,1.6117,1.0446,5.194,2.1146,2.4216,4.6565,3.5728,1.4901,0.4505,2.2967,2.0589,1.2246,3.4578,2.1311,5.9899,0.2845,3.7176,3.354,2.374,3.9062,0.3759,4.0918,1.6797,0.0094,0.0932,0.1105,3.2063,1.4309,1.685,0.0689,0.2636,7.2969,0.4979,0.2755,6.032,5.3902,0.0362,2.7563,1.8252,2.9626,3.0507,1.9522,5.9458,1.0187,1.1367,3.5113,1.5846,4.2418,1.6136,0.9351,3.4056,3.1777,3.4776,1.075,2.1389,5.4889,0.0044,0.559,3.2274,1.5941,4.397,0.4704,5.9861,5.7699,5.4082,1.4398,3.2827,3.2648,0.7055,5.7823,0.4207,0.0099,2.2109,0.0067,0.4655,4.7989,2.1596,2.8151,2.6347,4.8493,3.6038,0.0049,4.2484,4.5947,4.981,1.5011,5.2847,4.0104,0.8131,2.5662,3.6257,3.1914,6.3014,2.6359,1.1441,3.5719,2.2005,3.6158,5.8555,0.3394,2.9019,1.6695,2.4897,1.1203,3.4638,0.8439,3.2104,5.1449,7.0239,2.0823,0.2695,4.9383,3.3749,2.7082,4.2789,2.3455,4.2738,2.478,4.9663,1.7381,3.6936,0.2428,0.4051,4.4936,2.456,2.6284,3.9426,0.5798,4.1239,5.0073,0.0015,1.2937,0.209,2.8075,2.3671,2.4691,1.2827,0.1738,5.3706,1.7891,2.3595,5.5862,0.1694,0.371,4.1198,0.4144,5.6673,1.8142,0.4795,3.07,2.2784,5.5772,1.341,3.1006,5.2573,5.7583,2.4671,2.8792,5.3131,5.6677,2.5495,4.4965,2.4106,0.978,2.2623,2.7121,1.8812,4.6839,0.0033,0.3593,5.2517,4.536,0.8647,0.6921,3.4307,2.4057,0.5198,1.2241,1.9173,0.846,1.0967,1.1659,1.4483,0.0426,0.2902,2.3598,1.9463,2.5594,5.0182,3.6291,2.0771,1.9301,2.2666,2.4126,1.469,5.0281,1.3887,3.603,5.9433,0.4764,5.9245,2.6943,1.6641,1.973,2.3327,6.2907,3.0295,3.4335,3.6475,2.4324,1.0067,0.0079,0.1982,4.5763,4.3685,1.23,0.2046,1.5303,5.3939,2.5785,3.6639,2.7035,5.1704,3.5348,2.9752,2.2305,4.4857,3.4305,1.8223,6.1339,0.1901,1.2304,0.818,0.1278,0.2526,1.1397,2.1519,3.8975,4.4341,0.616,0.8773,2.0872,2.2443,4.4358,5.3166,4.0299,0.5589,3.6051,1.9901,0.4917,0.4685,0.1965,1.0852,0.7359,1.4037,5.5776,2.3834,1.4547,0.7263,0.0344,5.056,1.8456,0.187,1.2902,8.2058,0.3083,0.1478,1.6942]}
{"id":621,"ended":true,"length":500,"gen_text":"Between 1900 and the 1930s, the number of runs scored by batsmen, and the proportion of lbw dismissals, continued to rise. Bowlers grew increasingly frustrated with pad @ - @ play, and over the ensuing decades the practice of using the wicket was becoming increasingly unpopular; in 1939 the National Board of Cricket concluded that there was no reason to keep the pitch in the game, as playing time could not increase quickly with cricket.\nWith this was said to have become so popular and batsmen were required to go away, and the practice continued for many years thereafter. However, it is interesting to ponder the current state of the ball : it has always been a matter of who gets to the ball and how often.\nThe rise and decline of ball-and-pitch batting, and the rise of batting as a sport, has long been linked more precisely with the advent of bowling in the 19th century. The idea that ball and pitch should change during the game, and the changing times were often seen as part and parcel of the game itself, has taken on a second life as some players are being caught breaking the rules. In fact, while in any event bowling and fielding have been very well understood in cricket history, bowling has become more controversial in recent years when it becomes very popular to suggest that cricket should merely be one of various different sports: The sport of cricket can only change the way it plays, is a game with a very limited time frame, and is a lot of fun to watch.\nThe current state of ball and pitch has given rise to more and more arguments, and more and more people argue that the ball and pitch will only become competitive once more, when the games become more intense and the balls have a greater chance of winning.\nIs this so, or is this part of playing time at the top a symptom of the real problem we've been having? I have never even looked at the stats before, but that may be a sign of time on an issue of greater importance. I can only assume that the statistics used for this article are only limited in that they may not account for any other factors that could be considered. If you want to see how ball and pitch has progressed during the past decades, you can read The Complete Cricket Guide to England (or The Best of Cricket, or a whole lot else) by Ken Loach. If you want to see the historical record of ball and pitch bowling in the game, you can turn to The History of Great Ball and Pitch Cricket, by Dr Henry H. T. Moore.","token_len":520,"entropy":[10.5781,0.2374,3.8139,3.4636,0.0957,0.3234,1.7417,2.9175,0.0169,10.4653,2.7889,1.0955,4.8966,0.071,4.2488,2.8898,1.3704,5.9819,0.0969,11.6117,0.4166,9.1644,0.0663,0.9522,5.5228,0.1,1.5498,0.6005,10.9103,1.7916,6.897,4.0882,3.0654,0.8044,11.1319,14.379,8.4388,4.4729,8.0718,2.973,1.7217,5.5089,2.0365,4.549,1.3389,2.5521,5.2573,0.8645,3.5245,1.8272,3.78,0.2361,2.1325,3.6609,1.5818,3.3775,4.8095,2.9278,4.6204,2.1302,5.3143,2.3713,0.5278,1.5352,5.5217,0.193,3.7427,0.4146,0.8916,3.0166,0.4808,3.6888,1.7934,4.5903,2.6752,1.4978,2.5158,1.5158,3.2918,6.2316,5.6094,3.5203,2.1431,3.7753,5.4808,4.9201,5.1314,1.1563,1.5652,9.1983,3.7226,6.2471,5.6448,0.2486,1.2967,2.4137,5.2192,1.8608,4.1222,4.8144,0.1909,2.1656,4.5566,0.0636,4.7907,5.5873,2.8087,3.2169,1.9823,2.7401,3.486,2.5602,1.9973,0.236,4.0489,0.289,3.7767,0.1623,2.7592,1.7016,3.1365,0.1237,6.283,1.4272,4.4702,1.3721,0.011,1.2303,3.7309,9.115,3.2804,1.6185,4.0075,0.2409,1.5041,3.0319,0.0512,5.7902,2.8807,1.445,3.2441,1.2586,2.001,2.3998,1.7627,0.8233,2.41,1.9981,5.8052,2.0125,2.517,0.2113,3.2643,1.5896,5.0948,0.0047,1.6205,0.1895,4.866,2.9843,1.4801,0.6574,2.9012,0.6962,4.3407,2.6431,0.4818,1.464,1.0262,1.7837,5.2565,0.2854,3.66,8.1657,5.8915,1.0794,0.6654,4.6033,0.0373,3.1922,2.8326,0.5631,4.1452,0.0069,0.1638,0.7155,2.0231,3.9052,1.5723,3.3836,2.1974,2.1504,3.2883,6.3657,5.0622,0.9583,1.7066,1.9343,1.4905,2.5979,5.0013,5.3982,3.8183,4.399,3.5083,0.2535,3.9298,2.9477,0.0012,0.0532,0.8608,1.2888,2.9911,0.2926,2.0118,5.3733,1.0823,0.8898,5.6706,0.9485,2.8777,5.7364,3.5078,3.157,4.9622,4.6422,5.1482,1.0928,0.3952,1.901,2.7455,2.2762,0.1837,4.9448,4.4522,6.1729,2.5726,2.9689,3.7317,3.1075,1.4699,1.6484,4.2813,3.7631,2.9897,1.9696,2.1833,3.3482,0.3259,3.4748,1.4061,2.5332,2.2463,3.4422,1.6343,0.4964,0.4114,5.7426,1.4774,4.2607,4.6566,2.2137,2.1413,5.3162,0.3127,5.0371,2.0327,6.5139,0.5505,5.5097,1.5496,5.3723,3.5295,1.3299,4.2836,6.5026,4.2682,0.4019,1.8079,4.7169,3.1642,6.2277,3.7013,2.14,1.2979,1.7281,1.4137,5.6801,2.8669,2.9704,3.0602,1.621,2.776,2.1922,4.3655,2.7263,0.7098,0.4248,1.6377,2.7078,5.2207,1.1069,0.4163,0.8442,1.1018,0.4006,0.789,2.004,3.5518,2.9612,0.022,1.6671,0.5656,0.2575,2.2386,5.428,0.4753,0.0422,5.1412,0.9103,0.0075,4.7968,2.9981,1.6123,4.3533,0.4134,0.0012,1.6013,5.4152,0.9806,1.7071,2.8283,0.7797,0.1854,5.0296,3.7008,2.651,5.2989,2.3024,2.6388,0.951,3.7706,1.0446,5.1852,1.9515,0.9523,4.0017,0.9449,1.5059,4.344,3.4749,2.6108,2.1981,0.6983,0.3241,2.6716,0.4221,2.3372,5.8718,2.0889,4.8369,2.5143,0.3981,0.6051,2.6381,5.7584,0.1161,6.5787,4.361,4.8046,1.3004,2.3783,3.9745,4.9848,0.084,1.6932,5.024,1.3675,4.22,5.0417,0.9161,2.7785,1.5526,3.2566,2.8756,3.9279,5.2691,3.5696,0.3747,0.638,2.8962,3.9463,0.8532,1.0988,4.7401,4.6032,0.9755,2.4219,3.1129,0.8062,5.5361,3.7265,4.9911,1.7351,2.1177,5.7119,0.7766,1.0702,3.0129,3.465,1.7987,2.6446,0.2502,1.6201,5.5523,4.6509,3.2952,0.7703,1.2097,0.8539,4.543,5.3945,1.749,2.8606,0.3915,4.363,0.7721,3.963,0.0329,3.4793,2.7327,1.0739,1.9037,2.5043,1.7839,3.0549,1.4114,3.7022,1.441,2.3462,0.2153,2.6803,2.4318,4.4167,0.0952,0.0186,3.6842,5.0303,4.1336,0.5469,1.0621,4.7271,0.3634,1.8269,1.0832,2.3859,4.8918,5.4518,1.3771,4.3899,1.3504,2.9351,2.9654,5.4519,2.9985,4.5761,1.5758,1.3364,2.1197,1.8624,4.5773,4.679,1.0195,3.9095,2.036,0.9194,5.1258,5.3506,0.1285,1.0432,3.1647,0.1123,0.6746,0.239,1.2066,1.5989,5.1283,3.1845,0.4648,1.0201,0.0419,0.0119,4.4961,2.3776,1.204,2.6416,0.7721,0.5369,0.1707,6.3783,0.6771,2.2362,3.7862,0.1598,6.5834,1.2651,0.2943,0.4527,2.8508,1.9233,0.918,5.1418,5.7421,4.4092,1.8971,5.4997,2.8423,5.1161,0.7163]}

Suu also told H\u01b0\u01a1ng that the prime minister had informed him of the change.\n\nH\u01b0\u01a1ng said that Suu did not believe the prime minister had ever made a change on the bill he wanted to put forward. However, it is interesting to ponder the extent to which the Senate changed its mind after the Senate dissolved its own committee to look into the bill.\n\nThe Senate majority leader announced to the Senate that the bill the prime minister wanted to put forward included:\n\n\"Healthcare, mental health, education, disability, and other welfare legislation.\"\n\nThe bill would have made it virtually impossible for parents, caregivers and patients to find medical services on the patient side of the bill. This would likely reduce the cost of care for their children while making it more financially difficult for parents, caregivers and patients to seek medical services on their own from those on the patient side of the bill.\n\nWe do not have to wait for the legislative process to get underway to understand the changes in the bill, which will impact on the lives of so many families.\n\nThe bill also passed with Senate approval without any amendments and despite calls from the Prime Minister's Office and H\u01b0\u01a1ng to put it forward by October 3, 2015.\n\nWhat will happen next?\n\nNow is not the time to go down the dark path that you are familiar with by following the steps above. If this bill isn't dead in April this year, then I would urge you to call your representatives at the Office of the Senate Leader to ensure that they receive the same response.\n\nThe Senators will be hearing the legislation on Tuesday, April 26th over at the Senate Leader's Office. There is one day per week when you are free to call your representatives during that time period. Contact your Senators for help at their web site.\n\nIf you have questions, the senators will be in touch with their office staff and I am sure they will address them in a timely manner.\n\nThank you to all for your patience and support in the fight against mental health and the care of a young family. Thank you to Sen. H\u01b0\u01a1ng for reaching out to the Senate.","token_len":525,"entropy":[10.2275,5.9521,6.5965,12.7931,0.5803,1.5575,2.4329,3.7509,9.1125,0.3944,1.2866,7.2243,3.153,10.6021,0.0332,0.1907,6.1417,1.0125,9.88,0.4062,0.3222,5.9921,11.3961,1.3015,2.8716,0.0542,0.0136,0.0003,0.0024,0.0003,3.0741,1.7052,4.431,8.0554,4.593,3.0055,3.7145,2.6396,7.2147,0.7499,0.5392,6.2889,1.8522,0.9143,5.4288,0.3729,4.6812,3.5201,4.9922,1.4241,3.716,4.084,1.2331,3.5066,1.6435,4.4349,6.0495,0.587,3.8926,1.5355,1.5507,3.5219,1.6611,0.0013,1.6245,2.5714,1.0668,5.9814,3.4411,0.7359,4.5256,0.0016,2.4496,2.2468,1.2261,0.0008,0.0062,0.0002,0.0004,0.0002,0.7739,1.6227,2.7262,0.0028,1.7408,3.8465,0.491,1.3342,0.4086,3.959,1.4433,0.5886,0.0006,2.258,0.1625,0.0072,0.0003,0.0006,0.0002,2.1866,1.7439,2.5401,0.0024,3.708,0.0836,4.2596,1.4702,3.1922,0.003,1.4965,4.716,3.5154,1.5467,2.0797,4.7662,1.1147,4.6858,4.9268,3.5102,0.522,4.6602,1.4463,0.8776,3.5327,0.0157,4.3513,1.6864,5.3243,0.3277,7.6743,1.9139,3.4418,0.2328,0.0011,1.665,5.5059,4.5535,0.9554,0.2491,2.3907,1.5344,3.834,5.2418,3.3747,2.4247,3.0629,2.2758,4.4725,0.3776,0.5253,2.1971,0.6126,1.3559,0.0002,2.1017,1.6173,5.8268,1.5343,6.1922,4.554,0.7708,2.4303,1.1297,1.3523,0.7141,6.2605,1.3743,0.0027,1.3084,0.2292,1.8001,0.1248,5.0474,4.1869,0.4284,0.0002,3.0288,5.1979,2.3298,3.2091,5.5551,0.1486,0.7317,2.9655,0.4756,5.5028,1.064,1.9484,3.4898,4.0739,4.1987,2.5156,0.1653,0.0002,1.6302,1.1334,2.6516,1.9841,3.3431,1.0425,6.3582,0.1308,0.2315,5.0975,2.6254,2.9111,1.6922,4.2319,0.2602,4.6626,4.275,3.0604,3.5935,1.424,5.5899,5.538,0.6777,0.1139,2.5946,0.4989,3.097,1.1228,5.4381,4.8319,0.8984,3.8936,0.3135,1.0904,0.9788,4.1751,0.4173,4.5827,3.5021,0.5536,1.5183,5.755,2.1465,0.2437,2.5215,1.9443,0.0431,0.1242,0.1244,0.2068,3.3035,2.5416,2.0685,1.8488,1.9081,0.3398,5.5764,4.3799,2.6856,0.1589,0.6452,0.0771,1.0433,0.0297,0.0533,0.0979,0.3973,0.0002,5.8315,4.0619,0.4801,2.6344,3.5419,1.7047,1.0953,0.6219,4.7905,1.3451,0.1187,2.8846,2.2876,1.1436,3.7751,1.2611,2.8001,2.2871,0.6734,0.4255,2.2826,2.7827,2.185,4.6563,3.0016,1.4148,2.4696,0.0569,4.8061,0.0192,2.6832,1.1097,1.3206,0.0002,2.4179,2.0187,2.1692,4.5249,2.4035,6.1473,1.3572,5.6984,1.6624,1.7406,3.0365,5.3834,4.9505,0.7497,1.511,3.6598,0.0127,1.8688,0.2268,2.095,3.2587,0.0459,0.0202,0.0005,0.0007,0.0008,1.8022,4.3447,1.6123,2.1182,3.5824,4.1227,3.5912,1.1394,3.2747,1.5285,0.809,0.0002,4.101,3.705,1.0414,1.5816,0.4464,0.274,0.0001,5.6702,1.9804,2.4147,0.0199,0.0313,0.3349,4.4602,3.1913,1.2973,5.0556,1.9231,2.5667,4.7533,3.1888,2.8919,0.016,4.417,3.93,0.7229,3.3857,3.1868,0.3574,3.3915,4.0183,1.2976,5.4243,0.0004,5.3714,2.7256,6.4487,4.4035,0.2241,0.2702,2.0428,4.219,2.292,2.6826,0.6102,0.1447,5.1474,0.7674,2.71,3.1334,1.1693,4.2094,0.0553,0.795,4.0074,2.1703,1.2559,3.9108,0.7876,1.6651,5.5556,1.5592,3.1953,4.542,1.4698,0.8268,0.0002,2.5068,5.9069,2.4551,1.7514,3.781,1.6779,3.0746,2.0905,3.2454,0.6524,1.7407,3.9095,1.0674,7.0856,0.543,0.7943,1.2532,4.3131,0.3667,0.6317,0.4838,4.5489,1.3864,4.188,4.3095,4.9511,0.8168,1.2493,3.0388,3.1062,3.4753,0.0833,1.5767,0.8159,0.8525,5.9433,1.9484,0.2263,1.7517,0.7491,5.9876,0.7082,1.1122,3.3851,4.9323,4.3254,4.2823,6.2915,0.4844,1.7874,0.6705,0.0002,2.3482,0.3066,1.5297,1.7659,1.6901,5.4615,2.8863,1.1674,0.7644,3.4007,1.6976,0.9329,2.4411,2.6008,2.353,2.2314,4.3573,2.8667,0.8656,1.0992,0.1161,5.1825,1.326,1.8473,1.471,0.5742,0.2861,0.1639,0.8295,0.0002,3.3547,0.0127,2.8126,1.289,2.7456,0.3144,1.9438,0.8875,1.1516,2.4092,1.6849,1.6963,0.9784,5.9784,0.5448,1.4463,2.515,4.4523,1.1447,5.1602,3.5205,1.4853,0.3505,4.9576,0.0111,1.0656,5.1814,0.3264,1.653,0.039,0.019,0.0004,0.0013,0.0006,0.9135,6.0267,0.1488,0.3081,1.9332,1.6803,2.4398]}

The film was not a part of the police's database, and was not even registered under the department's 'N' and 'Civic Listing' rules, and the suspect, who had rented a small rented cinema, could not actually identify it.\n\n'The suspect was identified with two other suspects: one was a 21-year-old man who had previously resided in Ramoji but was now involved in the theft of a number of other films,' says the police's complaint, which was submitted in a report to the police in early February this year.\n\nIn recent years, the 'N' Cinema and the 'N-Bomb' are being used by police across England and Wales to show live TV news programmes about terrorism.\n\nIn September, a police officer was given a \"hot call\" when he was attacked by a man who had rented a film projector.\n\n'The suspect (a man) shouted 'kill all the terrorists' whilst attacking the suspect, who was also playing the 'N' Cinema, and then started throwing the 'Bomb' at him.\n\n'Although police are investigating the circumstances of the attack, the incident is over and we are currently waiting for more information as to how the perpetrator managed to reach the location of this incident.'\n\nPolice and media watchdog the Institute for National Security described the crime as 'highly sinister' by calling it 'a serious crime and highly unusual in this part of the country'.\n\nThe man, described in the complaint as 26-year-old Adi Yildiri, took the 'N' Cinema from its owner in central Ramoji and handed it over to a guard during the attack.\n\nHe said: 'The 'Bomb' took some of the 'N' Cinema video footage and the footage used to present it to the suspect.\n\n'A video of the attack can be downloaded here and was seen by some onlookers.\n\n'The 'Bomb' was seen by bystanders.

We're making a game that has a lot of elements with which to build on what we've learned over the years. I know what a game is.\"\n\nIt has since been suggested that Williams' new game will start off like a sequel, but the idea is that the new development team will focus on creating a new version of the game and the experience will be based on things like story and other elements of the game. Williams, the author of \"Shadowrun Returns\", said on Twitter: \"I'm just a developer who loves games so much and is looking forward to trying it out. I'd love to help out the team in many different ways which will see them build on the great work we've been doing already. At the same time, the game will provide an experience similar to those we've seen the previous game in games in the genre. If that's as clear, it helps make that experience even better.\"\n\nIn recent months, the developers have received multiple questions on how it will be played, and Williams responded by teasing a possibility of a sequel after their announcement in June 2010.\n\nWilliams and his team, which includes a former game designer himself, have since worked on \"Shadowrun: Shadowrun Chronicles\" and a game called \"Shadowrun: World of the Shadowrunners\" which was released during the same year. He told Sky Atlantic he has been working on the game for more than 20 years and he thinks the company will help them get it right.\n\n\"There's absolutely something for everybody at the moment, especially once we make sure things are running again,\" said Williams, who was asked about the potential game. The team has never had one client work on any kind of game and there are still a number of issues we need to solve. They'll continue to work on the first version of the game. \"We've got lots of questions. I would love to see people ask us questions.\"","token_len":534,"entropy":[7.839,4.9294,3.2643,7.5875,10.0992,0.6463,6.4024,2.3556,2.7295,0.0685,8.6843,6.2585,1.5354,4.3976,5.0885,5.673,1.0906,12.6325,7.6336,4.6667,7.5771,8.2016,2.2554,0.6878,1.2787,10.7203,1.7179,4.9597,0.16,5.1506,4.635,6.0736,1.9236,4.7785,0.6033,4.7645,0.0153,1.9297,4.5205,1.5262,5.357,2.5307,4.7155,1.8141,4.8824,3.575,2.019,2.4412,4.662,1.4962,1.5895,6.2135,4.3709,1.5539,3.1486,3.8606,1.826,2.5616,0.8394,0.4529,1.2981,6.0086,3.9476,2.2898,1.3246,5.9045,1.375,4.149,1.7394,0.6133,1.1574,5.6783,3.3375,5.2924,2.2005,2.8394,2.1729,0.1761,2.439,2.3548,5.7692,5.3905,1.5999,2.7494,4.455,3.9839,1.6102,2.2362,3.009,0.4109,5.7439,0.4173,2.9123,0.6431,1.3672,2.2656,2.2902,3.4532,1.3664,2.1073,3.8462,5.7138,0.0007,4.832,0.2681,3.7864,2.1746,0.605,4.5419,5.4156,1.4671,0.6193,1.933,1.634,3.7964,2.4829,5.4391,3.6508,5.1804,1.289,1.6653,0.802,3.4722,0.0227,4.9493,3.3077,2.35,1.2618,0.3772,1.2068,1.0017,0.3031,2.4541,0.776,4.3803,1.2756,0.8903,3.7986,2.9717,0.5467,3.9967,2.0352,2.1093,1.1003,2.8059,2.0647,0.6085,0.4714,3.3588,1.651,1.1398,0.3512,2.955,5.0943,2.1652,0.5377,3.0711,2.8332,3.8751,0.6625,0.7226,3.1518,2.2896,0.1641,0.9773,1.4852,2.1971,4.0089,2.5589,4.12,1.6122,1.3509,2.9142,2.5498,0.002,4.3269,3.6946,4.6604,1.0242,4.9062,0.2693,1.3993,1.6267,4.2125,0.3095,2.1283,6.0289,2.8799,3.631,2.1982,4.6071,1.9103,1.5076,2.5147,3.5315,1.6519,1.0729,1.5494,3.584,5.6859,0.6311,0.6956,2.831,0.4346,3.5305,1.1381,2.2418,3.4179,0.2223,0.579,0.3059,2.7937,4.0233,5.0111,1.4217,0.8335,5.4867,0.6587,6.361,1.2306,4.3463,1.6446,5.8063,1.324,1.6209,0.3099,1.1778,0.8812,2.2121,3.0218,3.9229,2.5088,0.2692,3.4646,4.4252,3.3406,3.723,2.841,1.1865,4.9666,1.1086,2.4282,0.1824,1.6523,1.6407,3.8664,4.1046,3.3729,2.4372,2.1211,1.5219,3.5607,0.2236,2.2234,3.1188,3.3584,0.507,0.0059,4.6005,2.8792,0.2521,1.1919,1.3768,3.4928,0.5189,0.1425,4.1614,2.6334,2.7101,1.0498,3.023,4.1196,1.5977,0.1541,6.1959,1.7602,5.9252,2.4021,4.1378,1.6703,1.6093,3.882,1.4259,1.7981,0.1642,2.2922,0.1725,5.0653,1.4857,5.8655,0.5026,1.1934,0.0012,0.5588,3.4194,1.5975,0.8679,5.5751,2.7707,2.1145,3.9344,0.0393,3.7483,1.9042,0.4794,1.7183,5.5174,3.1422,2.2415,1.8366,4.3667,5.3383,1.2021,3.0995,1.0609,4.158,3.1142,0.846,6.1318,4.9908,3.9235,2.3898,6.1035,3.1816,5.0525,2.3691,1.432,0.4698,0.6173,0.8889,0.0002,3.2729,4.72,1.1843,0.9232,1.9025,3.4455,0.4765,4.4115,3.7559,5.1049,3.1335,2.4804,4.4858,0.9615,1.5078,2.4524,1.436,1.3637,3.0265,4.998,2.12,5.4338,2.2142,5.3922,0.798,1.2991,2.584,4.8494,5.4306,4.0912,2.8394,2.5689,4.1906,0.4134,2.2863,0.0002,3.5269,4.0307,1.4387,0.4802,3.8224,1.7233,1.0186,3.607,3.3656,2.6491,0.279,5.8614,0.391,2.0827,3.6695,2.458,0.9907,3.6007,1.5126,0.0257,2.5001,1.5391,0.4889,2.3225,1.0149,0.9388,3.3735,3.4422,1.3614,0.4927,1.2891,0.0987,0.8235,5.5654,0.8987,3.9327,1.9301,1.8541,1.4558,1.7734,2.2675,1.3805,5.6391,0.6498,2.2404,1.4819,0.5363,3.7682,3.5112,6.1308,3.2419,4.0143,2.7511,1.8966,0.9643,0.2699,1.3413,0.6756,0.9385,2.7313,0.0025,3.0164,0.2552,0.9077,3.1582,4.0539,1.6663,4.606,1.8322,5.2007,2.7623,2.9704,2.4072,1.9602,0.3596,0.8725,0.0002,0.7126,3.5323,0.8548,5.719,3.3719,2.6415,2.0302,3.9178,1.8539,1.1131,1.7978,3.9935,6.1498,0.8977,5.0675,3.8001,4.5095,0.8507,3.8494,7.0635,0.9408,3.0305,0.0444,1.2341,0.6018,2.9243,3.6481,1.1469,0.9026,3.5895,2.6359,2.3069,5.7887,2.1896,1.7489,5.758,2.3874,5.2922,4.1523,4.8473,0.3038,4.229,3.9059,0.001,0.5988,3.1886,3.8526,1.613,3.0519,1.8485,1.2897,0.0331,3.9096,6.2127,2.0305,0.03,2.5304,1.3405,4.5743,3.1475,3.4031,0.2349,0.7677,0.3549,1.418,5.9615,3.1857,0.7152,0.5679,0.0467,2.3084,2.6894,1.3179,2.001,1.472,4.3717,0.1148,4.6648,3.268,2.3117,4.3365,0.8711,0.1119,3.1639,3.0825,2.1512,1.7903,1.6142,3.2816]}

{"id":2011,"ended":false,"length":476,"gen_text":"During late July, an upper @ - @ level low, with a non @ - @ tropical cold core, formed near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina and tracked southward. Gradually, the wind began to pick up and the @ level low continued to change.\n\nThe @ level low was recorded as 10 \u00b0F, although it has been recorded as near as 50 \u00b0F ( ) since early July. In late July, the low began to approach 10 \u00b0F after a peak of 4 to 5 mW in Cape Hatteras. On August 3, at 1.48 am, the storm moved out of range and into the Pacific Northwest with the largest storm in history.\n\nA total of two hurricanes hit California early this week, with multiple, small-scale, sustained winds.\n\nIt is now off limits to any \"homeopathy\"-based care in the community.\n\nAccording to this advisory, homeopathy can provide \"disease immunity, antiinflammatory, healing and relaxation services and relief from stress.\"\n\nPlease also note:\n\nThe storm made some of the closest landfall of the year on Sunday, August 7 in the Southern Alameda county, about 18 miles (23 km) west of Fresno, California. Several storms from that area have already made landfall on South Beach in the San Francisco Bay area in recent years, which will impact coastal Californians.\n\nThe storm is centered on Lake Tahoe, which was the center of a severe thunderstorm earlier in the month. The storm is overcast in both east and west of the Lake Tahoe region.\n\nForecasters are assessing the winds and will update local and state weather reports as the storm moves westward. The storm is forecast to cause a moderate wind gust of 140 mph, as noted above, but with potential at least 50 mph winds.\n\nAffected homeowners in the Bay Area are advised to do:\n\nStay out of the storm waters;\n\nStay out of the high winds over the area.\n\nFor those traveling through the region or with kids, it is best to steer clear during the storm surge.\n\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, the heaviest storm to hit during 2018 is the #9 hurricane in the Bay area.

{"id":4674,"ended":false,"length":491,"gen_text":"When Brady Hoke took over as Michigan head coach for the 2011 NCAA Division I FBS football season, Kovacs impressed him quickly. Kovacs was one of the first five players named as a finalist in the BCS national championship game by the Journal Sentinel, and his play in his first season with the Wolverines attracted top prospects across the country.\n\nWhen the Wolverines took a loss of 14-11 on Halloween that season, Kovacs was taken to the game after just six minutes of play.\n\nHe played on the sideline, and during his brief stay on the field he made a handful of saves to prevent him being stopped by safety Dan Morgan (who was suspended four games). After that he was never on the field again, since he returned to his starting role the ensuing season.\n\nIt was a tough stretch. Kovacs played more than 80 minutes in the first five games, finishing with 19 total tackles (13 solo), 4.5 tackles for a loss and 1.5 sacks. As part of his recovery, however, he had taken a week off from practice.\n\nAt halftime of a game against Alabama, Kovacs received a visit from coach Jim Harbaugh on the sideline to report a call for a tackle on Terrell Davis.\n\nIn the ensuing game, Kovacs was asked repeatedly to give the play-action pass, which was deemed a fake, and he had to stop the contact. He also spent 15 minutes on the field before calling for the call.\n\n\"I could have had a timeout in there because otherwise, that's what they call it,\" Kovacs said. \"I kind of went out there and stayed on the field. It was a lot of fun.\"\n\nIn the preseason, Kovacs received a full scholarship to Georgia and was part of a football team that beat a team from Iowa in the national championship game.\n\nHe could not be heard around the locker room during that match-up period. He did not want to discuss the conversation, but the rest of the team did say they had nothing but respect.\n\nAlthough he did start for Michigan, Kovacs left the game when the game was about to end until a stretcher fell on him on the sideline.\n\n\"What was that? I was trying to do the right thing, not be afraid of my teammates,\" Kovacs said. \"I knew I didn't have to do that, that just meant I had to do it because I had to protect myself.\n\n\"When I had that, I gave it everything I, my wife, my sons, my family and this nation needed.\"","token_len":535,"entropy":[11.3809,5.8052,0.0318,4.7516,1.2227,1.4208,7.241,2.7905,0.0272,5.067,0.4686,2.8498,8.394,2.7959,0.3857,7.9976,0.5877,4.654,0.4584,0.1995,14.444,1.0523,7.755,3.9635,6.6554,0.794,2.8061,0.0017,1.9965,3.3926,0.0189,0.5884,2.7945,5.6024,2.5532,4.7342,2.8957,2.1377,2.6583,0.0074,2.0035,0.2513,5.4463,0.3847,2.7011,0.6498,0.5303,4.8057,1.462,5.2858,1.1577,1.7915,1.0569,2.7548,3.7857,2.5024,3.6621,0.7905,1.1851,2.3785,0.2867,0.653,0.0005,5.0965,6.3303,5.7724,5.4566,0.163,0.3896,0.5383,0.719,0.0003,4.5131,1.7975,0.691,0.0019,2.8335,3.4364,4.9197,4.1656,4.2454,0.1506,4.1848,2.8783,5.8004,3.9182,1.5039,0.297,0.3953,0.0029,1.7777,4.9471,2.4231,1.0384,4.3497,3.7814,4.6545,3.3199,1.064,1.2977,0.7912,0.6529,2.3008,0.0002,3.3986,3.9983,4.4023,0.7924,2.7655,1.909,2.6381,4.9559,1.9856,3.6664,2.1889,2.33,0.3791,0.3766,2.2943,3.5436,1.7341,5.0237,0.0029,5.8835,2.1965,3.242,5.7449,5.671,4.8381,1.0168,4.4596,5.0293,5.51,4.2624,1.2915,1.4409,4.6628,3.5125,0.0601,2.7241,3.8175,2.4087,3.0864,1.535,4.563,4.2762,0.0972,0.0239,0.7235,1.4663,6.0084,0.999,4.2228,0.5659,2.2842,4.6225,1.5762,4.0143,8.3691,1.438,0.3039,0.361,0.0002,4.1383,0.9297,1.8282,3.4282,3.7337,3.1824,1.0148,0.0051,3.2903,5.0746,0.261,4.2266,1.6798,1.5464,1.7528,2.4856,2.9296,0.1076,1.9231,4.9921,0.4494,4.1205,3.1967,0.4146,3.108,4.1067,0.1944,1.0524,3.7568,0.2277,0.0125,1.1378,0.0097,1.8884,0.0014,1.2354,1.8208,0.0763,0.0254,0.1123,0.4437,5.3111,5.0004,0.0009,1.1583,4.0457,1.2501,6.3437,0.003,1.0659,3.0471,6.1792,1.3329,5.1748,0.0417,1.0997,2.8039,1.6055,0.6584,0.0002,4.4166,4.8227,1.2181,2.9908,1.8197,0.5317,3.8261,0.8457,0.444,0.0092,4.9375,0.519,4.9996,0.0214,3.7108,1.2449,0.2468,3.9444,1.0009,0.5735,2.6709,4.8427,3.2734,5.1882,1.6269,1.0044,3.2463,1.6421,4.4937,1.3607,2.8455,0.5269,1.57,0.0002,3.81,0.9511,2.7807,2.2461,0.2654,0.7814,0.0064,1.4276,4.3402,6.151,1.7927,4.8823,2.3033,2.9561,1.5755,0.6485,1.1151,1.9656,1.6922,1.6383,4.9635,1.923,4.5207,1.8808,1.035,1.6534,4.9013,1.414,3.3373,1.4362,6.501,1.0614,2.1846,2.9654,5.5186,5.601,0.4186,1.3036,0.1087,0.5846,1.7108,5.1939,1.4857,1.4491,4.7285,0.8605,0.3219,0.0001,2.1787,1.032,5.3855,1.4697,3.5547,1.2786,4.2856,3.7635,1.1225,3.8569,7.6458,2.2904,3.4049,1.1136,2.0404,3.2073,1.5533,1.3305,0.5194,0.3184,0.0059,0.2785,0.4664,0.1942,1.0705,5.5563,0.0009,3.7774,2.7841,0.1471,0.2354,5.5867,2.0378,0.4349,0.2548,1.5661,2.2919,0.7446,1.5709,2.8872,0.2494,1.4564,1.9404,0.0609,0.0002,2.8997,1.1201,5.1745,0.3708,0.4251,0.0044,4.6758,1.2386,4.9284,0.7715,1.2842,6.2624,2.7846,1.8823,3.8523,0.003,1.4456,5.4929,0.5459,0.3931,3.3843,4.4075,2.4412,1.3034,4.6169,1.6089,0.2802,2.1566,0.1957,0.0618,0.3529,1.275,0.0001,2.2421,5.6103,1.783,2.3133,5.2132,5.9534,0.4439,2.045,0.0188,1.4559,2.7553,5.7996,1.8186,0.022,5.2389,1.2665,2.4127,2.9959,0.7442,4.3083,0.0875,3.3422,1.2428,5.4951,1.781,0.9349,3.1298,4.3158,0.1217,0.2975,1.1482,2.4951,5.1926,2.0039,2.7995,4.5377,3.0297,1.0772,3.054,0.2697,0.0002,6.479,1.2854,2.3188,6.3135,2.9607,1.5616,1.0087,0.2758,0.0107,4.9328,1.2607,1.7087,4.5152,1.4612,2.924,0.7466,3.3041,0.0422,1.2904,7.6566,2.5791,5.5595,0.0004,5.0402,1.3495,0.5345,4.0309,0.3988,0.7075,0.2869,0.9058,0.0002,1.0603,5.7455,2.8704,2.0663,2.2965,1.48,1.93,3.3838,0.0311,3.4095,2.4513,1.0703,0.0271,2.1911,3.7298,4.2256,4.4013,1.6435,3.6591,0.922,0.5618,0.5543,0.0039,0.0654,0.1697,0.1357,0.8019,3.7414,1.0845,3.0727,0.0004,0.8717,0.8419,1.9588,1.5094,1.8673,3.0905,5.147,2.6458,0.7395,1.5407,0.4373,1.9454,1.3159,4.6661,0.6776,1.838,0.6488,4.0102,1.0905,1.206,2.0064,0.0001,0.0886,3.5465,0.7807,4.1102,2.3253,2.7473,0.6386,5.686,1.6249,1.9497,0.4011,9.0832,3.1243,5.6537,0.6958,0.7727,5.1208,0.6824,0.6784,2.6646,1.5361,5.915,6.2128,3.0902,1.4323]}

According to sources, Clarke initially thought he could turn his dream of directing with Tony Stark into a reality series and was willing to keep the idea in the script.\n\nThis could have been an entirely different situation for Jon Stark due to his father Robert's relationship and subsequent divorce during the early days of the series.\n\nWhen this article was picked up on Film-Talk UK in the UK, some have speculated that it was Clarke's role as The Hound that sparked the development of the plot.\n\nIn any case, as the news with Jon was the first published in an online online publication, we will know what a spinoff story it was in the upcoming issue of the UK's Sun newspaper, and are told that Jon Stark had the idea for it and is the only man with it, so there is no doubt he would have taken it seriously if he directed some of the other characters.\n\nHowever, there is not any telling of what sort of spinoff might come later on.\n\nAnother source close to the series has told me that there might be a spinoff based around the series' central characters, although this speculation comes as no surprise as the only way that Jon will appear in a fantasy series is with an unnamed male character, and that he is the only male character in the series at the moment.\n\nAn idea that has always haunted many series actors who played characters of the comic book series and has only become a little more prevalent as the series has become further and further into its own territory has gone unchallenged on our forums, as this story is certainly very well written and well thought out.\n\nAlso we've written that I am a bit of a fan, as we've been playing a lot of games with characters on television, and there will definitely be interesting stories set out in this film and in the show with The Hound, so I am still looking forward to seeing what makes it work. If you want, you could even follow me at www.tolkiennet.co.uk, especially if you like some of what I write about fantasy, you can find it on the web at www.thethegreatgreatgoodythehound.net.\n\nIf you liked this article, we will be looking into making more updates as we go over the first few months of filming.\n\nStay,\n\n\u2013Jon (@jonjonson) September 8, 2006\n\nAdvertisements","token_len":536,"entropy":[8.024,2.7956,4.9284,0.4721,7.0169,6.9412,2.8792,2.2939,0.9423,1.042,1.0767,3.5582,2.7145,5.8409,17.0114,6.134,5.8831,7.5739,6.8861,2.5577,1.439,3.7166,4.9597,0.7957,8.2561,3.4306,4.3781,5.0116,7.6491,0.8747,1.4426,10.8937,5.1845,2.0443,4.3723,2.889,1.7171,2.981,0.9343,4.3865,2.1075,0.8709,5.8091,0.0008,4.0204,0.6973,2.0107,5.9686,3.3784,2.0849,2.4417,4.9401,2.7321,6.1762,1.743,3.1964,5.4203,6.156,2.8531,0.267,0.2589,1.0195,3.5442,2.7657,2.9278,4.6676,0.0126,5.2353,1.3859,3.9919,1.7775,0.8129,4.2885,0.9817,2.1589,0.0013,5.0457,5.5614,0.9038,0.6383,3.0464,5.1144,0.2253,1.8069,2.0317,5.2092,2.0036,5.7401,0.0508,1.3823,4.6952,5.3611,0.7752,4.2907,5.104,5.2659,4.1775,5.5878,0.5917,3.2962,1.865,0.0346,0.5518,1.823,0.457,1.9986,0.0001,4.7515,5.1063,4.617,0.5232,7.9332,0.0206,2.0403,5.8507,4.9366,3.6629,4.6467,2.8258,3.1127,0.8629,0.5833,4.3361,5.875,1.4643,0.1674,2.4481,1.0486,2.9284,0.7376,4.3011,0.9856,4.1401,3.362,0.646,4.8681,0.4591,4.8207,0.1025,0.7647,5.3071,0.9983,1.4486,0.0001,2.6864,3.681,0.2602,0.0466,3.7933,2.6169,4.7516,6.0473,2.8011,2.4216,5.5534,1.7201,6.1304,2.7645,4.252,2.3789,5.7213,2.1174,0.5858,2.902,3.3563,5.3514,3.4365,4.7265,4.4944,1.0227,2.7215,1.8148,0.856,2.6145,1.3674,5.2566,2.3473,0.4093,2.1653,3.4021,1.6439,5.7186,2.0141,2.1943,2.2433,5.6281,4.9985,0.9411,3.2172,2.1986,3.4299,3.9897,2.5841,0.8987,2.999,3.7661,3.1594,3.634,2.8348,2.949,3.1541,3.3468,2.8621,3.5456,3.1019,1.0554,0.6294,1.5894,1.6674,2.4601,0.4858,4.3952,1.4417,3.2951,2.1511,0.8939,6.7261,6.2778,1.1017,0.5289,2.5429,1.1527,0.804,0.4125,0.0002,3.3276,0.0609,3.079,0.7825,4.6533,3.0888,5.4535,2.119,1.0775,4.3758,0.0222,0.9747,0.088,3.9479,3.4004,4.3902,1.4302,1.4296,1.1404,0.0001,5.8322,2.3496,2.2981,0.0025,0.5933,3.8871,2.4532,1.576,2.8388,0.223,2.7134,3.3573,0.4223,0.785,1.464,0.1953,3.7553,2.7042,1.3626,5.0597,2.7787,5.0778,2.2374,1.0587,4.1592,1.7723,4.9717,4.6589,2.8257,0.8198,0.0409,2.1402,1.4696,4.7953,4.0577,2.527,2.108,3.4282,3.4632,0.6645,2.8799,5.1954,1.7689,0.6502,3.11,2.7053,4.8043,4.7945,0.6033,2.2871,1.9858,1.9006,2.3303,2.1473,2.036,0.4245,2.2963,0.4231,1.8395,0.1774,0.7645,3.5924,0.7271,0.3635,0.1975,0.3137,0.0001,5.3892,4.538,1.878,1.518,5.604,6.1785,3.6699,4.5839,5.3374,3.9476,4.6404,1.8739,2.3569,0.8838,5.2775,1.2291,1.5148,3.4017,3.531,5.0015,3.703,2.5972,3.6812,0.4334,2.9856,2.4046,1.228,1.5772,0.6983,2.788,7.0275,1.1506,0.1709,1.5084,1.2495,1.9649,2.045,2.2017,5.5836,4.3718,0.0008,0.0003,4.5253,5.2092,4.7726,2.0845,3.3062,3.8249,3.4392,1.7798,5.2199,4.4466,3.4736,1.6359,0.6881,1.5848,1.9188,0.3463,0.3606,0.3725,0.0002,5.4847,5.5208,3.9257,5.6214,2.2207,6.0047,2.4031,2.8267,3.356,1.0634,0.1915,0.7018,3.8527,2.658,3.5732,1.7807,1.8566,4.0165,2.6662,1.6846,0.0876,2.835,1.2467,3.9395,3.666,4.6619,1.8647,0.9494,3.5094,4.6731,2.7294,0.0294,5.0469,2.051,4.4483,5.0525,0.9239,2.5973,4.1887,3.1321,2.2348,0.8472,4.7171,5.645,5.1944,0.3761,1.9793,2.3567,1.5816,1.9798,5.0669,2.3343,0.1949,0.018,1.2485,0.5161,5.386,1.6644,2.6383,0.7369,4.7923,0.9749,2.6396,4.9001,0.9809,2.0309,2.9115,5.2743,2.6197,4.5931,3.118,0.001,4.6301,7.0482,8.5896,7.2896,4.0755,1.2239,0.8382,0.0383,0.0014,2.505,6.0848,0.4363,0.0807,2.1951,4.1037,0.5878,4.9887,1.5641,2.0041,2.1792,3.6228,2.601,6.0385,0.4741,1.2737,2.5743,1.16,2.3076,3.0294,1.5184,0.4872,0.0006,3.5048,5.8184,5.2251,3.6948,5.465,5.4293,5.5624,5.4999,0.0967,2.9676,0.7206,0.5728,0.0002,3.2422,0.16,2.3434,0.1944,0.4834,0.548,4.4779,4.5591,1.2844,3.6338,2.1865,3.4788,1.1167,5.3643,1.8113,0.7179,1.7225,5.2865,0.8147,4.8643,1.5929,2.3646,0.2887,1.703,1.0428,1.3339,0.0003,4.4342,7.6622,1.9414,0.0002,4.1644,4.6087,6.0026,1.1808,4.7701,3.9811,0.5215,3.0894,3.6899,0.0054,3.5185,0.6693,0.0002,2.0831]}
{"id":4300,"ended":true,"length":512,"gen_text":"Several missions were proposed to demonstrate methods of landing the Gemini spacecraft on land. The spacecraft had originally been designed to land using a paraglider and a set of skis or wheels, however, after its success in its inaugural mission to the Moon, many scientists believed that the spacecraft's landing method was flawed. A small glitch in the design has delayed the spacecraft to the stage at the Kennedy Space Center, but other missions have been planned for the future. This design could allow for land and touchdown of the Gemini spacecraft using a robotic body on a landing vehicle.\n\nThe NASA team plans to start work in four new stages, one being the first of which will feature a landing approach. To this end, NASA will conduct ground tests for each stage to validate the work with a simulated landing on land. If confirmed, this will be the first time a flight on a landing vehicle has been completed with a human pilot on board.\n\nThis project can be considered to be some sort of demonstration of Mars'landing technique. It will also mark the first time the program has conducted a second manned Mars mission during the program's first ten years. It is the first time any of the space agencies have undertaken further space missions on a manned spacecraft. At this time, the missions are being piloted by representatives from the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity, Juno, Curiosity and Mastcam, which will all enter into the final phase of their mission.\n\nAfter their missions, the missions will go forward and provide the first glimpse of the life on the moon. It will also reveal whether or not that life as we know it can survive a long time on the surface of the moon. By next April, NASA will begin using space shuttle technology to help confirm that life can survive aboard the moon. In February, astronauts will enter the moon's surface to conduct experiments on a microgravity environment where life can thrive on Earth.\n\nAccording to the mission planning documents released Monday, mission development will be carried out under the supervision of the Space Shuttle Discovery Program Administrator Robert Lightfoot, who will conduct the program's programmatic review of the mission's development by March 20, 2017. Other work will continue under the control of the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity, which has been the only lander on the moon since 1997. The rover will land again at the Kennedy Space Center on April 5. The landing will be a mission to try to establish the first landing site for a human living in the lunar surface, with additional landers likely to be made available in 2020, according to NASA.\n\nFor more about the Space, explore this slideshow.\n\nTo see a larger version, click here.","token_len":538,"entropy":[9.654,3.0198,7.819,2.1983,5.9329,8.3934,1.0757,7.2075,2.9777,8.972,1.4909,1.3839,3.5816,1.4339,1.6751,4.4749,3.0661,5.0209,0.3628,2.6138,0.5184,1.6384,5.7655,1.0841,8.7104,5.2655,0.0344,0.6853,2.319,2.6807,6.9415,0.0416,7.169,0.8151,5.0473,4.5816,1.5424,5.7003,0.5888,3.6574,3.692,4.8957,0.9608,4.0238,4.4207,1.363,3.121,0.9178,1.5841,1.0413,4.9541,3.2003,3.6634,0.7359,0.9221,2.5197,2.3535,1.7045,3.0552,1.2512,2.3135,0.5645,3.9225,4.5736,5.8419,0.5359,0.31,3.8161,6.5159,5.168,0.5594,2.2296,4.1128,2.1885,6.2129,3.684,1.6135,2.5356,0.0094,0.0242,1.9877,2.4551,4.8291,2.4273,1.36,0.845,1.8101,1.4793,1.056,1.9363,0.4711,4.8588,6.1638,3.514,2.6328,1.9496,4.5606,5.3997,5.5626,2.931,0.3544,1.9116,0.2871,4.1044,1.2042,5.4883,4.5536,3.9788,1.4243,3.107,2.4447,0.7248,1.1156,0.0016,1.5676,4.7859,3.4521,3.505,0.1526,4.5812,2.3493,2.9921,5.7229,6.5857,3.6602,2.3261,2.9957,6.0801,1.3115,2.3887,2.7133,1.5086,0.8021,5.2084,1.0105,1.5917,5.0233,1.8204,5.6535,3.6635,0.2922,0.1056,2.855,1.4242,3.5088,4.4541,1.1841,3.7135,4.2113,1.4269,2.6564,3.3893,1.156,5.4408,5.2421,2.756,4.9424,0.7449,3.1386,2.2663,0.44,4.6139,5.5783,0.5121,2.0213,1.6176,1.5626,0.2688,0.2156,1.5879,1.7139,4.3203,2.564,0.7461,2.8476,0.1713,0.7525,0.5784,3.8065,3.0,0.9381,2.0684,2.6297,2.3602,0.121,0.2734,0.7278,0.0003,3.6022,3.7191,5.784,0.6016,3.4994,2.5903,0.1056,6.5775,3.0424,0.0009,4.0948,0.2804,5.0015,3.3718,12.0374,0.1469,3.5021,0.9399,2.7234,2.2717,2.0691,5.0754,0.4645,0.5341,0.419,1.9907,4.3854,0.3367,4.2913,1.2731,5.7095,3.7304,3.6801,0.6301,5.4858,1.3668,4.3554,0.155,2.6966,4.3806,0.213,0.3896,3.8177,1.404,2.5282,0.517,0.5659,3.8055,2.1645,0.3687,4.127,1.0517,0.556,4.0745,6.6132,3.1225,1.2821,2.2994,1.1979,2.5592,2.1042,0.5353,6.0575,1.8993,1.6467,0.1983,1.1859,4.5663,1.3338,2.7624,4.856,0.0004,0.3446,5.9479,0.6167,1.2,3.3127,1.5093,1.3629,4.2292,1.1331,6.958,0.6363,3.9837,0.9197,5.4198,0.1702,1.5846,2.4842,1.6962,3.8617,5.3137,3.6362,1.6453,3.6848,2.7477,0.1058,1.1963,1.8583,1.1411,0.4697,0.0002,5.6261,4.5031,4.7108,1.2125,0.7953,3.4764,0.4897,4.2862,4.6182,3.4577,4.5163,2.0089,1.9174,2.467,0.5023,0.9388,5.6744,0.983,1.289,2.9516,0.6665,3.8105,1.1189,0.9834,5.2245,4.2268,1.8472,0.0027,6.0281,0.2901,6.646,0.7949,0.053,0.0066,3.97,1.1221,3.6164,2.7506,1.3375,0.5725,1.2521,0.9103,0.3028,0.4935,0.5113,0.2765,6.4993,5.4599,4.1157,0.1413,1.8019,0.7956,2.0767,4.3104,5.3417,3.4781,2.9288,0.3908,4.1308,5.5287,1.5655,0.6531,2.3584,0.9319,5.6736,0.8055,1.8349,0.7746,4.1413,4.5962,0.4266,4.4981,0.9206,4.0244,1.0377,2.7585,1.1224,1.6979,1.738,3.3602,2.2914,0.9225,2.6892,5.3,0.2072,1.1633,3.8477,2.2691,1.8539,1.4389,2.4273,2.3293,0.3295,0.6979,0.0002,5.7308,0.0048,1.4206,3.5444,4.684,1.4578,3.3831,5.9276,0.2645,5.7522,4.4382,1.5469,2.061,2.5155,0.0146,3.4352,0.7549,1.7731,0.0262,1.233,2.854,3.0091,2.9027,2.3806,2.2998,3.4254,2.0256,0.1348,1.326,1.0513,0.7236,5.0031,1.4791,3.121,0.8813,4.9279,2.1284,1.554,1.7664,0.7848,2.2786,2.7321,2.977,5.0534,2.7579,4.0295,1.289,1.4776,0.1443,6.4384,5.314,1.1999,3.2547,1.3673,0.6893,3.7409,0.0062,1.145,5.1616,0.8357,0.8852,1.1797,1.0397,0.5926,3.191,1.2646,4.3358,2.9443,3.9517,0.1013,0.7606,0.6319,0.9519,1.7858,4.6485,0.2425,2.3113,2.4467,0.9134,4.1035,6.2009,2.4254,1.3997,1.0732,0.0216,0.0021,1.2109,2.0153,3.1691,1.7438,2.3819,3.6591,1.8971,1.2191,3.2021,5.3179,1.0461,5.5439,0.4072,3.9654,1.8151,2.8369,3.1051,1.5549,1.1825,1.9181,2.0214,6.0598,2.227,0.447,1.8681,0.9354,2.3781,3.2919,5.3321,2.3328,1.6762,4.7846,0.277,0.7018,4.7582,0.8828,1.702,3.9433,3.3717,2.2223,0.0019,1.7974,0.3534,0.4477,0.0002,3.6204,0.3259,3.4073,0.8016,4.2771,7.245,3.3726,3.4118,6.2599,0.9521,0.8585,0.0002,4.7403,2.3598,2.1788,2.8277,0.3039,1.2022,1.3603,0.256,0.1325]}
{"id":4574,"ended":true,"length":513,"gen_text":"Work at the pump stations and marine terminal, which had not stopped during the winter, continued throughout the 1976 construction season. Pump Station 6, just south of the Yukon River, had never been opened in its current year since 1969. But the park agency now claims to have completed 20 million gallons of gas on top of this tank to replace the gas that once cloged its reservoirs. The tank is on the water table for over three decades.\n\nThe pipeline and its connection between Yukon Province and the Pacific Ocean will carry much less gas than conventional pipeline and other forms of crude oil, but it's far better for the economy. On top of all that, it's a cheap and plentiful alternative to conventional crude oil pipelines, since less pollution is produced than producing the petroleum from conventional oil pipelines or pipelines that run on unconventional coal.\n\nWhat can be done to help our economy? One simple suggestion would be an easy, inexpensive and environmentally sustainable pipeline from Quebec to the Yukon basin. In other words, there would be a natural gas pipeline to get oil from the deep ocean into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThere is, however, a third major and ongoing goal on the ballot for the new administration, one that is more important than ever.\n\nThe most important policy issue of the new administration is one that is already being taken up by the public's right wing. While there are other areas of our society where Americans want more transparency, there are also areas of political discussion that we would like the White House to pursue in response to a public that wants fewer information about the pipeline's environmental impact. What are the priorities for the president and the Congress? And when?\n\nThis election season, Donald J. Trump has repeatedly attacked his opponent Hillary Rodham Clinton, saying she has \"a very, very bad temperament,\" calling her a \"liar\" and calling her \"Crooked Hillary.\" Although many Americans remain largely unaware that the President cares about the environment, there is real interest in addressing climate change. The pipeline pipeline, it should be said, could even be considered as a model for future generations for climate change.\n\nIn any event, the pipelines of the future are at risk because of the large amount of water they will hold and the tremendous amount of methane that they will produce. We're not going to allow that water to be used for any more energy, and the President should be taking steps to make sure that this doesn't happen.\n\nJohn H.

On January 25, 2006 \u2014 more than ten years after its release \u2014 the album was certified Gold, and its sales in its current year exceeded those of the preceding album.\n\nThe Food Album\n\nThe food album did not chart until September 20, 1996. It also failed to play a significant role in the early development of the digital music world. According to data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the number of digital downloads of approximately 1 million albums since August 1996 has surpassed the total amount issued by all record labels. On January 4, 2000, the music video for The Beatles' \"It's All In My Head\" hit a new level of saturation, surpassing an album that had sold more than 40 million albums in its original format while holding the same record number in 2000.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration estimated that the number of digital downloads will fall from 8,300 in 1996 to 4,400 in 2012. This will slow some of the growing digital music phenomenon in the United States, given its reliance on CDs and on other digitally available media as the main source of music.\n\nThe American Music Publishers Association (AAPA) says that digital music \"remains the fastest-growing technology, which will impact distribution, distribution and overall economic conditions, and the distribution of music in the United States without any barriers to access.\" Consumers increasingly enjoy digital music's ability to communicate over a mobile device. They could provide the internet to any group of people that wants to enjoy music. By allowing people to record and enjoy music, digital music also offers consumers with the ability to access and download the latest music from digital sources.\n\nPitchfork estimates that 5,800 U.S. radio stations have received a download file of approximately 3.4 million songs from the online music marketplace. The volume of this collection is one of the largest source of digital distribution options available.

My thanks go to @vikrk12 for all his help and feedback on this.\n\nRAW Paste Data\n\n@jmw0825: If it feels interesting to you, please do some background work. The first track from the film was one of the first recordings I ever made with @jmw0825. I do have a few ideas on what that recording may or may not be. The song \"Do Us One More Time\" has no ending, nor any lines anywhere in it (except its starting line, \"Just some time\" and the end of \"Do Us One More Time\"). The video here also has some interesting ideas on the recording. The whole second cut of \"Do Us One More Time\" is about the idea of the song on the stage as it begins. At first I didn't really think it would match (we were in a different room at the time), but after hearing some footage of the studio playing (troubled people, drunk people, etc...), I think it finally turned out the best way to fit the song we were talking about. The other song (the two main lyrics), is that sung as they play together. It is actually somewhat longer than this one and will only be about seven-hundred words. The first half of the film is about the song \"Dance Off on Your Grave\". It takes place roughly half way between at least one scene, when the movie is finished, and then about six minutes later. It is, in fact, far longer than most of the other recordings on this list - just about three hours. In other words, this is the shortest-longest short film I have made. This recording is for the \"Do Us One More Time\" part, which was recorded on a recording that was done with a high @ - @ turn studio to achieve superior sound throughout the film.

{"id":3041,"ended":true,"length":513,"gen_text":"On 8 December 1864, the bridge was lit by magnesium flares for its ceremonial opening parade, but they were blown out by the wind. The custom of lighting the bridge has continued for the entire summer. Today the bridge is illuminated only on the 6th of January every year.\n\nThe most notable aspect of the bridge is the high-speed observation tower. This tower is used by the police to keep track of incoming fire within the city during times of darkness. As its name implies, it is designed to provide a very high resolution surveillance of fire at night and on-going, and is the most important observation tower located along the western side of the bridge. The tower also boasts two smaller wings with additional ground controls for better control of the wind, with a central controls panel for navigation and for use as a mobile network. As a large tower, it holds four separate mobile stations, which makes it easier for officers to coordinate their forces and use them together from time to time.\n\nThe bridge is part of the National Trust, created in the 1950's to provide safety for cyclists during the Great Depression. Since the end of World War II, the bridge has carried on a tradition of protecting the bridge's natural landscape by placing a safety fence around it from time to time. Visitors to the bridge are asked to sign a conservation permit to mark the site which will then be posted with the bridge's owner's name, and will be used by law enforcement officers to report missing or injured passengers.\n\nThe bridge is located at 3075 North Broad Ave, between Sturgis and Parkland streets. The building will now be transformed into a \"New York City-style city\", with shops, restaurants offering dining, and a library. Visitors can tour the New York City, New York Historical Society, and New York State Museum, which has been in operation since 1903.\n\nIt is important to note that the bridge's bridge has never been damaged or altered. However, there is a history of over 100 years of history with the addition of this famous historical bridge with its own special history, particularly after the bridge was first built.\n\nIn 1960's, the bridge was restored to its original shape. Two years later, three years later, the original was fully restored. Since that time, the original structure, with its iconic gilded panels, rose to its historic glory. There is a unique design for each and every bridge built, with the one where the bridge was first lit now replaced with this famous one in 1963.\n\nThe bridge is open to the public as it is during the day, for free, from 8.00 - 10.00pm on 7 December.","token_len":542,"entropy":[7.4778,2.7731,4.9897,3.9458,0.4875,1.8992,9.3125,0.8337,7.908,1.5397,13.2402,5.6525,4.577,4.7811,5.3971,2.184,9.8776,1.9146,3.2289,5.7464,1.059,6.4657,1.5238,1.2393,1.5885,3.1737,1.0017,1.8136,8.8831,1.7852,2.2737,0.9942,0.4234,4.733,3.2268,2.2777,2.3031,4.8259,5.6272,1.222,4.8263,1.8853,1.1442,0.6741,3.7846,3.094,3.4081,1.4794,5.8852,0.0953,0.5977,3.0528,2.1129,0.0814,0.8973,0.9882,0.0068,1.6734,5.6838,3.5978,4.9944,0.1183,0.369,0.9416,0.5527,0.9235,5.7861,2.2569,2.9576,5.729,1.7676,1.507,2.2594,2.006,1.2847,3.6374,1.5694,1.0861,5.495,1.484,3.4038,1.2024,0.0032,5.5947,4.28,5.4372,0.7248,1.322,5.3877,4.7912,0.1229,4.3095,0.3489,4.2977,5.5563,0.2335,1.096,0.1146,1.3944,0.7989,3.5235,0.2815,2.3828,1.3035,4.1056,1.4995,4.5014,6.1476,1.3894,3.4664,3.4422,1.5407,2.4986,4.1153,5.3876,2.7157,2.6868,2.0216,2.6221,3.4545,2.6483,2.4935,3.0527,0.2463,4.8329,5.2494,0.4091,4.3598,1.8186,0.0144,0.2716,0.7756,0.2634,1.8216,0.5769,3.2821,5.6423,3.3265,5.5585,5.7296,3.4766,4.9692,5.9307,4.7523,2.3638,3.1211,2.8318,1.0228,0.9759,3.4955,2.9214,5.1751,1.9049,4.4728,5.5221,2.3612,1.5084,4.4601,1.2015,4.939,5.3066,1.501,0.3909,4.4989,5.6586,0.7881,4.7306,1.9783,5.6971,3.0462,0.6259,0.8923,5.1367,4.5233,4.2969,4.5763,3.0476,1.3698,2.5685,5.4443,0.2307,4.9759,1.029,2.9039,0.3383,4.1082,1.3501,4.6946,2.0631,5.5748,2.3542,4.0588,6.0937,3.1355,0.0507,0.0004,0.2516,0.7268,0.0002,1.1072,1.4699,1.4481,5.4944,0.0027,0.6589,3.3868,4.178,3.2947,5.0676,1.3309,3.4774,3.8875,2.4331,0.7713,1.6193,4.3459,1.3885,5.5261,4.1339,1.3691,3.0395,0.6488,0.3722,3.985,1.7421,3.3755,0.0008,0.5962,0.0046,0.1618,0.2746,0.767,0.9711,0.0973,5.9664,3.037,1.3016,1.5861,0.2843,4.182,1.174,2.7306,1.9908,3.4651,4.9217,2.7465,4.6244,2.8043,4.9357,3.1349,1.4065,1.4834,4.8593,3.0908,0.0023,0.0003,0.4782,5.5667,1.6503,0.3032,0.2648,1.8303,3.3397,0.0496,3.4169,0.3697,4.4732,2.0313,2.2734,5.1521,0.4642,2.2651,5.2822,2.2017,3.8838,0.2664,4.0679,3.6301,0.8735,2.7204,1.1368,5.398,1.1402,0.3854,2.4251,2.8145,3.6865,0.8889,3.1917,2.0495,3.634,0.0348,2.0193,0.8935,4.4788,5.1455,1.5141,1.7698,5.7571,0.7321,1.0343,0.0002,1.4347,1.1788,1.1002,2.8369,1.8764,5.7054,5.1047,3.8588,4.8494,5.1173,1.2143,5.0561,4.8474,5.6586,0.1509,1.1042,5.7918,3.1374,1.9402,0.9268,1.8912,4.1069,4.6255,5.4178,0.4819,5.4501,0.0939,0.4331,4.7814,5.7661,2.0066,0.6831,4.7772,0.9415,5.1368,5.3291,1.4525,6.1191,0.6719,0.614,9.1751,5.2972,0.8336,2.324,1.7371,4.163,1.409,3.464,1.2,5.8882,0.3042,4.5479,0.0283,0.4288,4.9663,1.9166,0.2453,4.0419,0.1342,0.6656,1.2205,3.2171,0.1062,1.5476,1.5644,2.1384,2.4809,3.5034,1.5116,3.1454,0.4961,0.1653,4.9851,0.2695,0.9615,0.0002,5.3103,0.4989,3.8722,0.097,0.1634,0.1417,0.8618,1.2252,2.716,6.0136,3.5663,2.8304,0.2148,4.7065,1.5087,3.628,1.1333,3.6874,0.0515,2.8365,1.5893,0.8418,4.5933,0.4752,4.5507,2.7238,0.6155,0.2879,3.9984,3.4332,0.5086,5.764,0.0429,2.5312,5.3479,4.8003,1.5783,6.4217,1.6469,2.7893,2.8273,2.9484,2.3796,5.8797,4.3056,0.7445,3.4287,0.4474,3.4524,1.1313,1.1663,1.3785,0.0002,3.8803,5.2252,4.0506,0.6994,0.9587,2.1965,0.3031,4.2621,1.0162,0.283,0.3576,3.9055,2.3613,6.2539,1.4583,0.0939,0.3358,6.3575,1.0646,0.7017,0.1959,1.5512,2.711,3.9806,4.6298,0.6754,1.1661,3.702,2.6633,0.1075,0.1705,0.8081,2.6545,2.5446,3.552,2.6422,0.6644,5.74,5.7107,3.0769,4.624,0.6572,5.4356,1.8132,2.7727,4.904,3.1636,0.6978,5.3257,1.1731,1.2504,4.2973,4.7178,3.1654,2.5176,4.3168,0.0119,1.1724,4.3317,1.7929,2.109,1.4066,5.2383,5.5068,0.502,1.2239,1.6857,1.9292,4.9066,6.0341,5.1041,1.2855,4.1196,4.8284,2.7455,3.8159,3.9432,0.3848,0.6869,0.0002,1.4746,1.9745,1.2999,2.601,0.9617,0.4008,0.0072,4.7787,2.3281,0.5056,3.7727,0.7558,1.4281,1.0327,5.1771,3.5636,1.6876,3.197,1.8028,1.6569,1.0526,5.7843,2.2081,0.0337,0.115,1.4257,1.9427,4.8847,0.5037,0.8781]}
{"id":4968,"ended":true,"length":496,"gen_text":"On February 20, 2013, Sony held a conference in New York that announced the PS4. Fox appeared on @ - @ stage during the conference and recounted participating in an anti @ video 'taped in which the female gamer was discussing the fact that we're now free because of DRM and PS4' Sony also spoke about the Xbox One's launch in April 2013, a day before the PS4 had launched and during June 2013. According to Sony,'PS4 and Xbox One are just two brands that are on the same level of development together,' according to Sony, while others such as the new Xbox One have been 'done for free since 2012', with more than 200 game titles being developed for the PS4 for developers like Sony.\n\n...'PS4 and Xbox One are just two brands that are on the same level of development together,' according to Sony, with more than 200 game titles being developed for the PS4 for developers like Sony. According to Nintendo,'We will be adding more content to our marketplace as we get closer to release', making PS4 'the most popular platform for PC and console gamers.' A Nintendo spokesperson declined to comment and stated, 'We will not comment on details, like last year's announcement about new consoles, but you can be sure we already know where they will come from. When we do, it will impact on our game titles, our social impact and the game's ability to market across the world.'\n\nThe video is apparently intended to show where the games should go in the future. Sony could be the game that is'done for free since 2012' but it's too early to tell if it will go that far.\n\nMore from The Verge:\n\nThe latest news from Naughty Dog and their studios in this week's video include plans to create a mobile version of their'Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare'franchise. It is being developed by Square Enix's development studios, Square Enix Interactive Entertainment, Fable developer Take-Two Interactive.

{"id":3230,"ended":true,"length":493,"gen_text":"The colouration of the males allows them to visibly stand out from the brown forest floor. This bright colouration provides a sexual advantage for the adult males, increasing their likelihood of successfully mating with the females. These are the true colours of the sexes. The female species thrives because of its ability to form alliances with the males across distances.\n\nAnthropogists, biologists and anthropologists have used anthropometry to study the sex differences in sexual dimorphism before and after Darwin. The most popular is the gender ratio on the Giza Pyramid where men are 1:18-1:12 and women are 1:6-1:7 with the largest differences between the sexes occurring at 1:31-2:03 for males and 2:06-2:11 for females. Scientists use this to analyse the male characteristics of the animal, making sure they conform to the group rules and keeping the members with the most malevolent intentions. The best examples of this are the two big pom-poms, the males being so ferocious at pups which show a male's cunning while his female relatives have only a female. In fact, while females show the most cunning of all groups, males are less likely to be interested in mating.\n\nWe know that our evolutionary ancestors hunted for food, even where they didn't have the ability to do so. One obvious way to understand the way our ancestors hunted is as a result of their ability to make their offspring strong and independent. That means that we would have evolved to be highly tolerant of females because we could provide the males with any means of food that they wanted, without necessarily needing to force them to act viciously. It also explains how large groups of animals, including our ancestors the mighty elephants, evolved to avoid male aggression. It also explains how female size is reduced by a selection of traits in females to which males have no control. Male intelligence is the key to being successful in life. At different speeds females must swim for water and swim for food.\n\nWe are still working on this one, and with lots of new knowledge we might still start to know more about how sexual dimorphism affects males, because of the difference between one sex's behavior and another's sexual dimorphism. In any case, I am pleased that there has been interest in the topic. We're not ready to just try and explain it all in the simplest terms for another 2 years yet.

We need to have something that reflects, it's just the beginning.\" In March 2016, the Grammy Award nominated artist gave the first major announcement of her new album, which has featured R.

{"id":1176,"ended":true,"length":521,"gen_text":"Even before Congress approved the Boulder Canyon Project, the Bureau of Reclamation was considering what kind of dam should be used. Officials eventually decided on a massive concrete arch @ - @ gravity, where it could support more than 5,000 people, and the other reservoir, which contains water from both dams. But the Boulder Canyon Project was rejected because, as the Bureau of Reclamation describes it, the basin is \"too unstable to support even moderate life during times of low rainfall and low temperature.\"\n\nThe state legislature subsequently approved the $750 million project, giving the state and county money for a $1 billion project to convert the basin into an outdoor recreation area, with more than 200 recreation areas and sports facilities.\n\nIn 2003, the United States Environmental Protection Agency was the first state agency to test the proposed dam. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, it was created to help with flood-prevention when the U.S. Water Resources Management Agency (USMWA) proposed the massive plan. As part of its research, FEMA created an online database to track development, so some of the water-stressed areas could be accessed by law enforcement.\n\nBut when the Federal Emergency Management Agency issued a $2 billion grant to create the lake and recreation center (MOOC) next month, concerns were raised about its potential environmental impacts, says The Denver Post (emphasis added).\n\nThe Colorado River is one of several rivers that are often identified as reservoirs by the government. That means those who work in the areas should consider what they'll do if a dam isn't built, says New Energy Finance reports. The Army Corps of Engineers will work with the Colorado River Authority to create a reservoir that will allow drinking water and electricity to the river, said New Energy Finance.\n\nBut this doesn't mean that there won't be rain. According to the Bureau of Reclamation website, a reservoir on the Colorado River may hold up to 1.7 inches of rain \u2014 well over 6 percent of the amount of rain the USGS projects. There could be anywhere from 2 to 7 inches of rain per year if you leave the reservoir near an existing dam, adds New Energy Finance.\n\nWith water pumped through the Colorado Creek, some streams can turn into a lake that can hold up to 16 feet of rainwater, New Energy Finance says. There are also streams that could fill up with floodwater. Water for a river can be built either on the Colorado River or on the Colorado River National Park.\n\nEven in areas that aren't reservoirs, it's quite possible that the Army Corps of Engineers has been working on a project to control the Colorado River by pumping water from one reservoir upstream that could have been converted into a more accessible water source.","token_len":555,"entropy":[6.2396,7.914,4.4289,0.5766,12.3822,6.2028,5.0529,0.6406,1.7393,4.3324,0.0283,3.0692,0.0011,2.6638,4.4489,4.5761,4.7627,0.0015,6.3893,4.6306,0.2453,3.9742,1.6451,6.2341,5.7691,1.3002,1.8019,0.8539,5.4103,3.8572,6.9655,13.202,8.2028,5.7962,11.9384,3.1069,4.5786,1.5775,2.0592,2.736,3.2137,0.2484,3.7357,0.304,0.1375,1.9777,2.3545,1.8411,2.6859,5.2756,5.159,2.1856,1.4978,6.3203,3.6317,1.1841,5.0521,3.6851,0.5075,3.4796,1.4916,2.9484,0.5584,1.1337,1.552,4.5431,1.5016,4.169,1.7411,1.5279,1.4748,0.1945,0.0057,0.0001,5.8805,0.6371,0.2582,1.9588,4.9322,1.4489,1.228,2.7838,3.7853,1.1476,1.6509,4.9434,5.4845,5.1137,5.7754,4.5401,0.0765,3.4707,1.1358,2.28,3.5061,3.2503,0.405,0.9343,0.0004,1.9541,5.4783,3.5053,5.3187,1.3736,0.9977,3.4185,5.5807,0.0811,0.9192,0.8354,6.0284,1.0337,1.8403,3.3977,4.1993,4.2618,2.0293,2.0653,2.5531,1.8949,0.9277,2.3784,0.9748,4.8169,0.7787,2.3992,0.4638,2.4271,5.0293,1.2142,1.091,2.3068,3.2564,3.873,0.1277,3.6974,3.8803,2.0196,2.1335,5.3144,1.1306,0.636,1.1805,0.0002,2.9909,4.8897,0.0907,0.9801,5.0913,0.275,2.9033,0.0022,0.0034,5.084,5.2185,0.5089,3.2612,1.216,0.1633,4.6736,0.9759,4.9555,2.3894,1.2385,4.4377,0.0008,6.4736,3.6021,0.0567,0.0174,0.2668,3.0428,2.3208,5.5889,1.1653,3.1451,4.1492,3.848,2.896,2.6032,0.0865,5.8825,1.9984,3.004,0.0008,0.0025,0.0024,5.4498,0.1236,1.8368,0.2655,1.6899,2.1875,4.8243,0.2478,0.0605,4.3123,1.6904,5.6642,5.413,2.0715,4.5114,1.9283,0.0013,1.6412,4.5591,0.2773,5.5313,3.9468,2.5054,2.7471,0.7986,1.7991,1.8998,4.8843,2.8859,4.9809,5.9877,1.0647,0.1969,4.3201,2.7245,5.3882,1.6952,0.8756,1.9324,0.285,4.2301,1.6973,5.2995,0.0615,0.8589,0.5651,0.0002,3.0538,3.9338,1.0099,5.1153,1.1063,0.0014,0.0067,5.0946,0.9393,4.2868,2.9536,0.4162,3.3056,1.0721,4.4372,1.0166,4.7758,2.7145,4.1585,3.5336,4.8893,5.7936,2.4083,1.3701,5.191,3.3151,0.0755,6.3091,1.8815,0.133,0.9907,2.7162,2.5492,2.7569,1.5668,2.2756,4.7339,5.0123,3.0886,0.0287,5.4088,3.135,0.4677,0.5719,0.867,0.0002,1.7563,3.0615,1.613,3.1583,2.2401,0.0829,3.5778,1.4326,0.9008,2.4316,4.3475,5.5722,0.4376,4.1184,2.7592,1.0481,4.0741,0.9735,5.0147,2.6917,4.5902,3.0905,5.1133,0.7434,1.3351,3.9975,4.6736,3.2003,3.8401,1.9924,4.1219,2.2906,2.1063,2.9971,0.7126,3.1775,0.0004,0.4806,1.5435,1.2087,5.409,0.5908,0.2336,7.0563,0.1186,2.8871,5.5456,0.0053,0.036,0.0001,4.5046,3.5444,0.838,0.8176,2.1345,0.3551,1.2543,0.6761,3.176,0.8076,2.5535,2.5087,1.314,2.8216,3.7891,0.0503,3.4485,4.9141,0.4282,5.7296,2.3527,1.744,4.8746,1.8645,0.0056,0.3461,0.3225,0.457,0.0002,3.0331,4.8269,3.2834,0.0004,0.3304,1.4696,3.5263,1.5923,0.0001,0.0434,5.5637,2.1244,2.9278,0.0015,1.3331,3.4621,0.0018,0.0234,0.0001,2.9391,0.1822,3.2648,2.6228,4.3202,0.4106,0.5255,0.139,5.0314,3.6791,1.4977,0.1576,2.9235,1.1517,2.7838,2.0282,0.1998,0.3192,5.2068,4.0401,1.473,5.0344,2.3142,0.1682,0.5501,4.0728,0.9622,0.8284,2.6934,3.4716,1.7674,4.2772,2.4524,5.3425,3.9468,0.913,5.2936,0.2884,2.8689,1.6111,3.1052,0.0917,0.4033,0.4671,2.4131,0.644,3.1852,4.962,4.782,0.8034,1.4072,5.5027,3.4225,3.4484,1.2238,1.1439,5.9451,0.797,0.0081,0.0385,0.0765,0.4324,0.0002,5.103,4.0172,4.9493,2.9437,0.6602,1.7656,6.5361,1.2563,4.6602,4.6618,2.5528,4.5151,0.3431,3.391,2.1632,2.9082,1.236,1.1713,0.778,0.0115,4.7248,2.4164,0.2674,0.6872,4.8387,1.7714,2.0661,0.0124,0.0181,1.5728,0.0745,4.6546,1.1312,1.1136,3.2756,0.808,2.6271,4.5479,0.6579,0.7802,5.0076,0.8163,1.783,4.607,4.8451,2.8306,3.5751,1.7192,1.7389,5.7709,5.2111,2.1239,1.2596,0.8213,0.4099,0.37,2.0575,1.0467,0.9146,0.3353,4.5428,2.1123,1.2945,0.5809,0.0002,4.4802,3.54,3.3758,1.4092,2.3216,0.0004,3.2277,0.1189,2.9067,0.6127,6.157,0.2342,0.5016,1.7818,5.8496,0.0026,0.1341,0.0005,4.2914,3.3262,2.7112,0.7997,1.3524,1.7829,1.7819,4.7004,1.1724,2.0049,0.1368,4.8395,2.4509,0.963,1.4685,4.0409,1.1727,5.5522,5.3905,2.1774,3.9721,3.09,5.3541,0.3529,0.728,4.5888,4.8281,2.3302,0.3881,0.5479]}

{"id":3056,"ended":false,"length":552,"gen_text":"Sometime during the sixth season of The X @ - @ Files, Anderson approached series creator Chris Carter and asked to write an episode. Anderson's own beliefs in the power of spiritual power are well known in the comics. The series' primary theme was the power to free others from the restraints placed on their bodies. Anderson was born to a Christian Orthodox father in California, living a mostly family life until he attended St. Nicholas Catholic School. Anderson said of his parents: [Anderson is] very Catholic. And in the first couple of episodes of this show, I've seen people saying, 'This is your kid.'\"\n\nDespite this, Anderson still has many critics who claim to love his character; one recently came out for him as a gay character, with a tweet from actress Sarah Silverman expressing her disapproval: \"When asked what she liked more about being gay in the past five years, I'd say he's an easy choice. He's really the opposite, and the fact that he's a young, Christian, man in a dark place has taken over my faith, so I'm very positive about it.\"\"\n\nAfter making the rounds in the comics community and on TV on the podcast, some said that Anderson was just too gay, especially towards gay characters (including an actor playing a homosexual character in the series), but that's understandable: The comic book world can be divided into two different camps, either accepting or rejecting their own characters.\n\n\"It could be that I am really into gay characters but that they're more in line with what's at the center of American life nowadays -- that it's okay to kill one's loved ones,\" Anderson said. \"You can accept that it's OK to have a loved one suffer a lot of pain but that's not okay in this world. It's okay to have a child suffer from a very real problem in your life that didn't even exist before, where you had to live a very different life. People think there's something wrong with us, what we're out there trying to do. That can never be acceptable, it may be, but you know what? It's not going to change anyone, it's just not acceptable to have children die when the parent of the child of the parent isn't giving them what they deserve.\"\n\nOther people, including Christian Catholic groups including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints who have also had gay and lesbian relationships, have asked Anderson about where he's coming from to stand.

{"id":4739,"ended":false,"length":510,"gen_text":"Following criticism over the sensitivity of their tyre compounds, tyre supplier Pirelli announced changes to their tyre allocation for the Spanish Grand Prix, making pit strategy the focal point of the Grand Prix, where teams will have more space between laps due to shorter straights.\n\nThe changes were intended to make pit traffic less congested across the day, with the exception in the final corner where a yellow rower broke on the apex.\n\nHowever, during qualifying, Pirelli and Honda agreed to a change to the strategy on the main track to allow tyres to be used on the second corner.\n\nAhead of the first test, McLaren Racing will use the tyres of both Mercedes-Benz and Williams for the first qualifying session at Pirelli facilities, with F1's biggest driver in his second season, Nico Hulkenberg, still planning to test while McLaren tries to increase the number of races this year.\n\n\"At the moment, we're taking it a little bit more conservative with it, so there's not a problem with the tyre mix,\" said Pirelli's chief technical officer, Jean-Pierre de Gendt. \"We're really excited to give the impression that some teams are having a big influence.\n\n\"To give our drivers an opportunity to test, where the tyres might not be used all the time, which will be important, allows them to get on with their training, while also giving them more time without doing this extra bit of work.\n\n\"The advantage for us over teams in qualifying is we're more comfortable as they're more disciplined in that direction. What we were able to achieve at Monaco and qualifying is something unique for our brand, with the amount of laps and the cars that they're on on the track, as well as the way that they drive.\n\n\"We're in very good shape in that regard as well.\"\n\nIt was unclear whether the changes would affect Alonso's relationship with Honda, with the Spaniard recently informed of what he considers Alonso's \"difficult relationship\" with Renault's Kimi Raikkonen, who is still trying to finalise a deal for a season, or not.\n\n\"There's absolutely something on between them. I don't have any comment at this time,\" said Alonso on Facebook.\n\nThe news came as Renault revealed new engine kits and more advanced suspension work to be put in place by the team.\n\n\"We're absolutely committed to achieving the best possible result,\" F1 chief Tony Martin said at the International Grand Prix.\n\n\"I mean it's a real honour for us to be able to provide so much. We have great drivers, that's good, and we have more time to do our homework.\"","token_len":558,"entropy":[9.6421,3.0654,1.0945,7.9366,0.1978,3.9336,13.454,6.6543,0.3414,6.3696,3.3847,5.1269,0.2844,0.004,4.6931,6.4134,0.4479,1.3093,1.7116,6.2698,2.9149,1.3202,7.1171,0.2404,0.0012,2.5317,4.9144,5.7226,8.9669,3.1803,6.0137,0.0223,0.4858,0.7483,6.7754,0.0518,3.646,3.8236,3.5409,1.4286,2.45,3.7812,4.0949,3.6489,6.1992,5.617,0.0087,4.8092,4.6527,0.0612,0.5693,0.3027,0.0003,1.9226,1.9705,2.3622,6.1893,0.0835,2.8002,1.5669,6.0917,1.6024,1.6565,0.011,5.5348,0.2874,4.3311,0.731,1.9377,2.0581,3.8663,6.4225,0.8677,1.9672,3.1652,1.8778,2.8767,4.6081,6.0228,3.6495,5.2252,5.176,1.0014,4.9523,1.9756,0.6511,0.0002,2.6423,0.062,5.0249,2.869,0.978,2.8372,0.0123,0.0011,4.678,3.2983,4.9153,0.9916,2.7143,3.2274,1.1961,1.3861,4.1456,3.8806,1.2879,5.7989,1.6671,2.6557,2.2983,5.1231,0.576,0.7242,2.2718,2.2509,0.9094,4.422,3.0169,2.3067,0.3591,0.0002,3.8482,3.7283,0.005,0.3655,3.7645,3.3669,0.8446,4.3652,5.462,3.4368,2.7539,1.9774,4.3474,3.0666,3.4139,2.7221,1.2456,1.2511,0.4294,4.2701,2.7076,0.5972,1.7057,4.6212,0.8506,3.503,4.5639,0.5729,0.0074,6.2223,1.9329,1.4902,5.7947,0.0163,0.9927,3.1807,3.8874,4.5297,4.7996,2.0455,1.3507,2.8176,2.8448,1.0672,0.0015,0.0,0.0,0.1542,4.9721,5.7024,0.3769,2.067,6.245,3.487,4.4598,0.148,4.8432,1.6295,1.6607,0.0142,4.6034,4.544,0.7091,0.3301,0.341,0.0002,2.5899,4.461,0.7491,0.627,0.9742,1.0626,1.657,5.0598,3.5168,2.052,1.0502,0.5627,1.1262,3.4027,2.6344,4.8116,1.5911,3.018,2.9502,0.8373,2.6761,1.3538,5.4971,1.4751,1.8411,2.6853,4.3191,0.945,0.9923,2.5175,0.0241,0.0016,1.8857,1.7362,1.4533,0.0385,0.9448,4.8668,0.3694,1.715,5.0684,4.7697,0.3384,0.3343,0.2548,0.9537,1.6492,1.3843,4.3672,3.2811,2.1538,4.631,1.6324,5.6826,0.3817,5.7768,2.882,0.7514,5.0815,0.6182,4.2155,2.3296,2.7544,0.5765,0.0002,0.0326,5.7036,2.5322,4.0391,1.0674,3.0802,0.8807,0.1287,1.1492,2.0662,5.6347,2.6035,1.866,5.7921,1.4894,0.4557,1.597,4.5502,0.5864,0.0499,0.3074,4.6094,3.3648,1.3107,2.8769,1.0366,6.0293,1.3753,0.1261,2.6414,3.7966,1.05,1.019,3.9244,2.2232,4.6502,0.905,1.6966,0.5265,2.5094,1.2064,6.9058,5.6751,5.6354,3.1512,3.7957,0.1651,1.9731,1.0987,0.4369,0.0002,0.0344,2.556,5.5309,2.7335,0.7849,4.164,3.6743,2.9994,2.8528,0.2723,2.8607,1.9296,3.7087,2.805,5.3652,4.5694,1.6084,3.2718,5.167,2.2075,4.7486,4.5502,0.9952,6.2981,0.704,5.0402,2.7685,0.0015,1.6308,3.2607,4.4011,2.9305,4.4547,2.1931,4.1571,6.1566,2.0302,3.3655,4.6077,1.5969,3.6115,1.6574,4.4458,0.0146,4.6871,3.1602,1.0042,5.396,1.6832,2.9347,1.0907,3.093,5.3963,0.7327,0.892,1.5331,4.3599,0.1481,0.0436,0.6887,2.8351,1.5588,0.9604,3.4426,1.1019,0.3704,0.0002,0.0431,1.4699,1.1439,4.6908,4.2263,0.2023,0.9272,3.0128,2.4386,0.7552,3.3627,0.7014,1.7553,0.5328,0.0002,4.8339,1.8752,3.8777,1.3065,1.207,1.1768,0.7869,1.0788,4.4132,0.9688,5.4807,0.0092,3.1897,0.9192,2.1323,1.0242,1.8155,0.0006,4.5675,5.6533,1.1601,4.986,0.6703,4.1659,4.4726,0.2022,2.0071,4.2262,1.1847,1.6488,0.3327,0.1298,4.8627,1.9878,4.0065,0.0011,0.0076,0.0,0.0,1.5746,1.1199,1.656,3.3982,4.2749,0.0317,5.5181,0.0178,0.4861,0.7576,1.9355,1.5267,4.6378,3.6707,2.9243,6.1657,0.2543,0.2471,0.0002,1.7166,3.38,0.7298,5.8253,5.0454,4.308,5.2151,1.9796,2.6084,1.7002,1.3887,0.0004,3.7209,0.6044,2.6913,1.8551,0.4366,1.2576,0.4454,1.1306,0.4073,4.3443,6.2339,0.4752,1.0493,0.0003,4.4044,4.2612,2.3158,1.1787,4.0794,3.2461,5.2916,3.9085,4.2777,2.4478,4.7951,4.1795,3.8513,4.8827,3.1387,3.3873,3.6233,1.9534,0.1371,2.4071,0.972,2.2441,2.0522,0.5093,0.0002,1.3428,1.3798,1.368,5.444,2.0909,0.0968,5.5253,1.4679,1.5309,0.2863,2.3308,2.3006,5.7141,0.0142,1.2963,5.6772,2.0148,0.4042,2.843,0.4535,5.9527,1.4129,0.0001,0.8324,0.4873,0.0003,0.1655,3.4125,5.1992,3.3275,0.199,1.7602,4.5908,3.2812,1.6306,0.791,0.5217,1.1015,1.2947,0.0081,4.0868,3.9497,0.4533,4.8755,1.5503,2.4987,3.986,3.2036,1.7809,6.0067,0.6387,5.5216,2.2186,2.2004,1.0422,2.342,5.1014,4.1106,1.0166,2.0328,3.2125,3.1465,2.616]}
{"id":329,"ended":false,"length":488,"gen_text":"The current Romanian Land Forces were formed in 1859, immediately after the unification of Wallachia with Moldavia, and were commanded by Alexandru Ioan Cuza, Domnitor of Romania until his abdication in 1866. Domnitor was in charge of Romania until the mid-19th century, when he married Nava Ruzu K\u00e1pizcu.\n\nDomnitor was a member of the Pima administration under then Emperor Robert III, and was known for his outspoken criticism of the Hungarian monarchy. During the early 1940s, he organized what he called a special \"council of experts\" to study the new Romanian constitution, which he said would have the largest ethnic Armenian population in Europe. After K\u00e1pizcu's death, Pima became embroiled in a political conflict with Hungary, which led to the establishment of the Hungarian military and a large influx of Hungarian troops to the region in 1956. One of Domnitor's first acts was to introduce a compulsory Armenian passport requirement and ban Hungarian Jews from entering Romania, and to ban Hungarian Jewry from the country.\n\nDomnitor said that the Russian constitution had \"very bad aspects\" and in any case he and the other leaders of Romania should have been more outspoken about their country's history against the West. Domnitor wrote that \"anyone who believes in one country's history, who believes that the two nations are coequal now may think that is the only way to explain Western policies. If any European country thinks that history is really wrong, there is no alternative\". At the same time, he said as he had expressed his views that the state of the Soviet Union and \"Russia today\" were \"too close to the West to form a coherent, lasting solution.\" Domnitor said that Moscow would not be willing to accept \"anything that moves at the expense of Russia's independence\".\n\nDomnitor died in 1998 at the age of 52 in an extremely difficult time. At his funeral, Domnitor was widely read by his political activists. The only time Domnitor's name was mentioned was in the Romanian election of 1988, during which he was declared an emissary of Pope Paul VI of the Orthodox Church at the Vatican. He took up three prominent positions of the Romanian government: Prime Minister during the 2000 elections and as First Minister during the 2002 elections, but he lost to his rival in one of the first major campaigns for Romania's presidential seat. He has said that he will not return to Romania now that he has won over all of Romania's voters.

{"id":3205,"ended":true,"length":535,"gen_text":"The Kirkus Reviews described Middlesex as a `` virtuosic combination of elegy, < unk > study, and picaresque adventure ``, and Adam Begley in The New York Observer called it `` a'' ', that it would be '' not only fun to tackle but to be told about in the same way as the films that were screened in the theatre, and that in the time it would take time and research to have it'''''\u00a0to feel all this and learn. The book also features an amusing discussion on the nature of interdisciplinary approaches to human science and ethics, but no mention of the interdisciplinary nature of the genre. On the other hand, the book's subtitle is, I think, '' a good place for a study of our world, one the books will likely include for use as a basis for future articles.''\nCatherine Johnson's book has since been published in the English edition.\nThe first reviewer for The New York Observer, David Wood, is quoted as saying, ``I can never imagine someone using a modern scientific genre to make a point about some of the key terms... This may well be a good opportunity for a deeper philosophical analysis of the meaning of some of the jargon of modern science. But it is a mistake to use this opportunity to suggest that ` the science of medicine'''\u00a0, which is so important in the present society, is somehow somehow inferior to what'science'''\u00a0 is and must be. There is nothing on which the latter should be concerned in this place, even if the latter are to be thought of as trying to convince the common man and woman that `science'''' \u00a0' is not necessary in their world and must be treated differently.'\nAn earlier article in the New Yorker by Robert McGovern at the beginning of the book described the'science of medicine' simply as a '''''' where an academic `'''\u00a0' was called for, and a subsequent review of the two pieces stated, `` There is little to be said when trying to apply the same kind of general vocabulary or conceptual vocabulary to the whole of modern science, because not even the most sophisticated of scientists has ever learned how to deal with it.'' In any event, I am concerned that any attempt to use common sense and common interest in this book to make any point about modern science will be misinterpreted by people who don't care about science, but merely apply it to their own personal interests.\nI recommend this book to anyone who wants to explore the implications, and I think that it gives new meaning for this essay to describe the problems that must then be addressed if one is to understand how modern science and medicine has changed, what it has changed for the better, and the very nature of scientific inquiry.","token_len":558,"entropy":[11.1335,3.6927,5.7321,9.3822,13.1213,0.3902,1.4571,1.5529,8.4622,15.4781,0.061,3.4945,0.0074,7.2941,0.1858,11.085,0.9747,1.1855,12.5769,10.2581,6.2221,4.5515,9.0994,1.3688,1.8551,10.659,3.525,0.0259,5.2734,8.2055,2.6454,1.7331,11.6125,9.8332,0.2888,5.3807,2.8386,2.6726,0.6471,5.9053,2.2686,0.6021,0.5355,2.1053,6.9151,10.0156,5.5804,3.1948,3.7942,1.4016,3.0218,5.0085,1.631,5.007,1.4495,6.1758,1.3176,3.036,2.5224,5.9667,2.4659,3.2297,1.8857,2.3031,0.6229,1.1399,1.8286,5.3163,2.7275,2.8761,4.5995,1.7642,1.4759,4.6874,2.2756,1.5628,1.425,4.6354,1.597,4.3207,2.1345,0.9273,0.407,5.3192,3.1371,5.5017,0.4905,5.0331,3.2325,15.2515,2.8097,6.9248,4.7799,4.9461,4.8067,3.2882,3.777,4.405,3.9625,2.349,4.2168,3.2966,3.9309,2.4493,5.0243,4.2804,3.6383,1.2056,4.4077,0.1126,6.3654,2.023,4.931,0.4407,5.6042,5.0445,1.6333,5.396,1.1215,4.6989,5.0092,2.3865,0.3863,1.2565,5.7471,0.1169,1.6229,0.0682,1.2815,4.9638,0.9725,5.517,0.8504,1.0311,0.0306,0.078,1.4236,1.3383,2.8214,3.3732,1.7932,3.7726,3.9605,0.8291,0.1046,4.5863,2.8047,3.878,3.176,2.8789,1.6533,5.3129,0.3026,5.1849,4.6788,1.8306,4.3187,6.2363,5.6993,3.358,3.7722,4.579,4.5819,5.7663,2.1071,0.8604,4.5822,0.2563,1.8583,4.7874,1.6745,2.7517,5.6672,3.2467,6.1171,2.7485,2.4381,3.5615,5.4808,0.6852,2.1223,1.2732,1.6326,3.6741,3.3569,1.8947,2.5178,2.5411,3.9826,5.6106,3.5499,1.5747,1.2548,0.2143,0.7764,1.3392,3.756,6.237,0.7973,4.0236,3.2423,0.6478,0.2079,1.0874,1.0044,2.5945,3.4747,4.6819,2.4998,5.8144,5.5031,1.8293,5.8151,4.4255,4.9373,1.6638,3.1168,0.9769,3.1366,1.395,4.9372,1.8093,0.3331,6.3337,5.8505,6.8234,4.8467,4.3357,2.1547,0.3343,1.725,2.9959,3.8252,0.7028,1.9339,5.7656,4.3681,3.2229,0.57,1.088,5.3035,0.226,4.9661,0.2508,0.3714,5.6016,4.1104,3.3587,0.3516,1.707,2.2994,1.5533,1.3078,2.1087,4.2774,0.2039,4.3065,2.7885,6.5033,0.5628,3.6108,0.2221,6.1927,6.447,2.7009,0.7345,5.0933,2.8024,4.8586,2.1555,5.0844,2.3195,1.344,5.2761,3.1424,1.7208,1.4254,4.351,5.0592,0.4413,0.8178,3.7246,4.1704,3.9621,0.3304,4.1329,4.4001,17.814,2.7971,2.5321,0.5886,5.6258,5.7179,5.0442,0.2864,2.3212,4.368,0.9429,3.1825,4.7517,2.5509,2.3157,5.1349,3.6708,0.7737,2.9451,3.3017,1.549,5.8221,1.4825,4.1649,1.0422,1.9043,1.9376,2.9782,2.975,0.7635,4.4136,0.2877,0.2389,5.577,0.1531,4.9557,1.7889,4.7006,1.2646,3.9774,3.3094,0.7824,4.2009,3.4305,6.3798,6.9874,0.1099,4.9645,1.263,2.375,5.234,2.821,3.7316,3.5004,2.7025,2.3596,0.403,3.6215,5.2794,4.9805,1.7644,4.9892,3.6664,3.9997,1.4431,0.9547,1.6273,2.2468,3.63,3.8437,5.7239,3.2857,5.6878,1.0181,3.6122,0.0168,1.4804,2.8225,3.7977,1.1282,12.005,3.4081,1.3522,2.9238,7.1069,10.0227,0.1295,1.7455,3.6663,10.9433,3.0665,5.9708,4.6709,5.2314,5.6599,4.0649,3.6722,4.2588,2.8471,4.0486,5.2308,3.215,2.9793,1.3406,2.389,5.3361,2.7032,1.0548,0.7305,6.915,4.8502,5.0838,1.3635,0.9766,5.6532,0.797,3.2867,2.414,2.27,1.6659,5.4527,4.073,0.0445,5.3459,1.5166,2.6757,3.4306,0.0004,5.298,5.5473,4.1728,4.9693,2.7111,0.6227,1.7682,4.5755,1.5848,3.1977,0.6456,1.505,3.9766,5.4639,3.2264,1.3238,1.5281,2.5596,1.6559,2.2974,4.9926,1.9748,4.5965,2.2109,0.1022,4.4424,0.051,1.5939,0.944,3.4144,3.5475,1.8009,0.0765,3.3981,2.8288,4.9775,0.8552,4.5069,1.0348,0.3572,2.667,5.5995,1.3848,1.9737,1.8043,6.3139,1.8833,2.8358,2.2504,1.1083,2.3461,3.6106,2.321,0.6771,3.8409,0.2445,2.3273,1.1215,5.1791,0.0056,1.9837,3.2725,0.4036,3.5781,0.034,3.264,0.7356,2.4123,1.7642,3.4957,4.3832,5.8273,1.5263,0.9569,2.0995,0.3931,2.1461,2.2134,0.6556,1.3191,2.9246,5.5448,1.7118,0.3117,0.8129,0.6842,0.8325,1.5166,0.2331,3.271,0.8021,4.7025,4.8014,2.3521,2.5256,2.8197,1.7764,1.4085,4.9325,5.3843,1.0009,4.7367,4.1493,5.7737,2.7658,3.7115,1.1618,4.8041,1.788,5.693,6.065,0.365,1.4521,3.1285,4.3497,1.1968,0.3497,1.6753,2.7237,2.0028,0.1851,3.1202,0.9153,4.2753,3.0838,2.9151,3.5716,1.7806,1.987,2.2912,1.1531,0.7781,0.0765,0.5642,0.3105,3.2869,5.3401,1.6395,0.1048,3.6001,1.1892,0.6551]}

It has also been described as a series, \"a crossover by a bunch of people on different worlds, who are trying to keep things as they were before,\" which has been referenced in a number of instances.\n\nAccording to Marvel, the Justice League's final mission before Superman's death is to find an army of superhumans to fight the Spectre during their time as champions of light, and with the help of the Dark Kingdom, will lead Superman into an adventure that would have him defeating the Spectre.\n\nGallery\n\nT-Shirt of Superman\n\nT-Shirt of Superman with Green Lantern\n\nT-Shirt of Superman with Green Lantern\n\nT-Shirt of Superman with Green Lantern\n\nWith Green Lantern and T-Shirt of Superman\n\nAppearances\n\nDC Comics Legends #22\n\nDC Comics Legends #12\n\nDC Comics Legends #17\n\nDC Comics Legends #36\n\nDC Comics Legends #35\n\nDC Comics Legends #21\n\nDC Comics Legends #11\n\nDC Comics Legends #22\n\nDC Comics Legends #23","token_len":560,"entropy":[7.4085,3.4727,1.9138,6.8977,3.2947,4.2134,0.1485,6.0347,13.4218,11.5102,6.1277,6.109,4.4374,8.7068,8.7035,1.1307,5.2693,6.4482,7.382,2.9419,0.3983,4.912,6.0727,2.3605,7.5287,7.0412,0.1819,1.4976,7.88,4.0894,2.4356,6.6553,1.3405,7.1592,1.5928,6.4763,1.4117,2.2957,4.4988,7.9028,4.9102,5.2545,0.0105,0.9477,2.3573,4.3645,1.3188,5.2632,4.9505,2.2956,3.9979,2.463,3.7924,0.8588,4.8571,5.0587,5.4957,3.6477,5.5655,3.9842,2.2051,0.4007,0.1129,4.1972,3.6563,1.6575,1.2589,0.0036,4.6762,2.7187,3.6825,3.2237,3.504,3.6526,2.784,2.8686,2.865,0.0095,3.7978,5.8898,0.3872,2.126,1.2349,5.2227,5.4785,0.0257,5.786,3.6803,1.2049,2.5607,1.4,4.7028,5.8169,3.3991,3.8518,0.8889,5.4846,5.4246,1.8611,2.2234,0.0002,3.8765,2.4425,4.4304,2.5441,5.81,0.0498,5.1638,5.6764,1.4609,4.3258,2.7751,3.2202,2.6235,2.168,0.676,1.254,0.2705,0.0441,0.2256,0.2355,0.1298,0.0155,0.0516,0.3888,0.3584,0.0131,0.0194,0.4583,0.4925,0.0115,0.0102,0.4372,0.4541,0.0071,0.0095,1.3539,0.1151,0.0082,0.0076,0.2679,0.8724,0.0002,2.1881,2.0887,1.9897,2.789,1.6873,4.8302,5.6951,5.8769,4.8088,1.5771,2.6913,4.3791,3.5252,7.0318,6.4761,2.1062,2.2848,4.7247,0.079,0.0022,2.9204,2.9615,1.4528,5.6558,2.578,3.1291,2.4266,0.7215,3.3461,2.6312,2.8991,1.8176,3.3676,6.1663,2.6993,2.1829,3.5493,3.4022,1.0169,0.0003,1.3708,0.4765,0.2148,0.4224,0.7252,1.7804,5.4782,4.3834,1.5511,4.1667,1.7874,0.909,4.7985,4.7561,0.3405,4.1909,2.474,4.7592,3.4678,4.1813,3.6773,3.2321,4.8797,3.1888,5.4049,3.1133,1.7591,2.7548,2.8941,3.335,2.2038,5.9991,2.432,2.6545,1.0942,0.5562,0.0003,5.3372,3.0833,5.0337,0.3595,2.2287,1.7252,2.7271,2.4984,2.2777,2.9425,4.0821,1.2932,5.7714,2.3286,3.3266,1.9736,3.5136,1.3733,5.5662,2.0167,1.0364,5.1348,2.8291,0.6408,0.274,2.3631,3.097,6.7311,0.1058,1.026,5.4037,0.7847,3.8027,0.3725,0.2917,3.7078,0.7434,2.3841,1.8586,0.7107,0.0779,0.0005,1.6705,0.378,0.0002,5.4131,0.4579,0.9132,0.0003,5.8172,1.2825,1.8052,3.7623,4.4948,0.3607,0.9575,1.1264,3.1921,0.6545,4.4461,0.3299,1.0696,1.0926,1.5266,3.3556,0.156,1.8628,4.1087,0.0339,3.5022,0.9218,4.9205,0.0091,3.4598,0.5876,4.3731,0.0927,0.9709,1.1604,0.0002,4.3105,5.6936,2.4599,3.7748,2.3337,0.8715,1.8287,2.6628,3.464,0.2674,5.6205,3.5445,0.7921,2.8631,0.9952,0.3582,0.7752,5.4145,2.1991,5.1367,3.6327,3.0496,1.3492,1.0211,4.6312,1.4802,4.7185,3.413,1.2414,4.087,0.8523,5.8633,0.0078,2.1333,2.5376,0.4167,5.3221,3.0142,1.2014,0.1461,6.553,0.8882,1.5291,3.3048,4.9974,3.2454,3.3367,4.5716,6.5781,2.8349,4.6279,0.0594,1.7163,4.6603,1.8626,3.3055,1.8882,3.1284,2.0635,2.0334,0.0229,3.842,2.7434,1.8507,0.682,1.6278,1.1362,2.5786,2.5189,2.5162,1.5115,3.3375,0.9094,3.2322,0.4798,0.0016,5.3157,0.8702,0.3927,0.0002,4.8679,0.0062,5.4114,1.7388,1.5168,2.9886,0.0313,2.6115,5.483,2.7312,3.9354,4.0781,0.8924,1.1471,1.1796,0.3806,2.6453,3.8011,5.7228,0.1546,2.4917,2.8441,2.1873,2.4208,1.5259,5.9314,6.2322,2.5262,4.0513,1.8208,6.4171,0.4165,5.4809,1.8617,1.635,5.0613,1.2361,0.7367,0.0043,1.7595,3.5727,5.9048,1.0331,4.1997,5.0713,3.6707,2.8405,2.65,3.7993,1.5423,2.7613,3.7586,3.2383,5.2605,0.8077,1.3734,1.1327,0.6567,0.0002,5.1127,0.3275,0.0003,5.4451,2.4399,0.615,0.4852,3.6557,1.5891,2.709,0.0002,1.6927,0.0446,0.1093,0.0048,0.0455,0.9941,3.8462,4.8022,0.2949,1.251,0.0002,0.8853,0.0036,0.0345,0.0063,0.0274,0.0743,0.4577,1.2001,0.0546,1.1532,0.0002,0.7367,0.0026,0.024,0.0065,0.014,0.0407,0.2568,0.8207,0.024,0.6703,0.0002,6.4087,1.7294,0.0143,2.4799,3.0902,0.0904,0.1022,0.0187,0.1067,0.0288,0.4831,0.0002,4.4298,0.5522,0.0003,4.33,0.9906,3.493,2.9661,4.868,1.254,0.0002,1.8422,0.4434,0.0746,0.0243,5.4672,0.1657,0.0002,0.7153,0.0265,0.0715,0.0123,2.6245,0.1562,0.0002,0.5532,0.0077,0.055,0.0138,5.7025,0.1468,0.0002,0.5484,0.0042,0.0334,0.0111,4.1265,0.1139,0.0002,0.5205,0.0026,0.0243,0.0077,4.4088,0.1414,0.0002,0.4244,0.0018,0.0169,0.0052,4.9395,0.1366,0.0002,0.3789,0.0018,0.0124,0.0054,3.4836,0.1246,0.0002,0.4278,0.0014,0.01,0.0055,3.0903]}
{"id":4683,"ended":false,"length":473,"gen_text":"In the fifth match Rey Mysterio ( managed by Jorge Paez ), defended his WWE Cruiserweight Championship against Chavo Guerrero ( managed by his father Chavo Guerrero, Sr. ) During the fight, he beat Tristan Jones in the ring to secure the ring. During the match, he defeated Andre the Giant in the second round. During the match, he beat Eddie Guerrero in the ring to secure the ring.\n\nTrivia\n\nYoshi Yoshida was once called 'Father of Wrestlemania' by the company.\n\nYoshi Yoshida is one of the few wrestlers that can fight for gold.\n\nHe was interviewed after being stopped by Chavo Guerrero in April of 2011 and the following year he said that he would like to win a WCW championship with him. A few days later, he said that he had no idea what to do after trying to convince another wrestler to stay with him. It was announced that Yoshida would win the title during the match, and later that day he said that it was just to lose. [1] After telling Chavo Guerrero about his story, Yoshida said that he felt bad, but not in any way upset. According to Yoshida, he asked Chavo to stay and after the fight, he showed him what was going on. [2]\n\nYoshida's nickname: The Superfan (takes the form of 'Super-fan') is a reference to Yung Lean, a former WWE World Heavyweight Champion and the character's main villain, who makes two videos titled 'Super-fan' and 'Yung Lean', with footage of the matches and a list of his most recent matches. It has also been described as a 'Yung-Wang'-chomping character. When looking at his videos I feel that Yung Lean is a little more 'The 'Super-fan-' character', that if Yoshida, then an extremely charismatic man who will fight hard for the title for sure, could win over a wrestler like him, then that Yung Lean could be seen as one of the guys he is best known for. However, I think this was a big, big mistake he made. It's because if something was wrong with the wrestlers of the time, that's how it was. [3]\n\nIf you watch the video you will see a picture of the wrestlers who worked for Yoshida at various times, all of whom look the same.

The Khaavani dance has become popular during times of increasing Hindu hostility and fear of any outsiders.\n\nA group of about 10 or 30 young people at the Kama-yoga in the Kama-yoranga valley play with the music of The Lark and the Siva Mahasabha Dance for years, sometimes as many as a hundred kurana sitthis followed by dancing around the temple. As a group of about 80 people in the temple in the second day of this month, an ancient band played The Bambar Bhagav and the Panga-Yoga, and there are many more here and there.\n\nPeople from all walks of life are involved with this event.

{"id":1615,"ended":false,"length":530,"gen_text":"After the 1920 season, Barrow resigned from the Red Sox to become the business manager of the Yankees, replacing the deceased Harry Sparrow. He took control of building the roster, which included the entire team that ended up coming to New York on the final day of trading Day in 1939. In 1942 he would spend the latter half of the season with the Yankees in the New York Rangers as the director of baseball operations.\n\n\"With this job, [Barrow] and his team of guys just didn't have the tools that they needed to be successful,\" Steinbrenner said. \"And it was just too much work.\"\n\nBarrow spent nearly five more seasons with the Red Sox; he never left but had to move to New York, with Steinbrenner's blessing, for one more time.\n\nAfter a tumultuous first season with the Red Sox, in 1938, Barrow was hired as an assistant manager for the new league's division, the Braves, where he will lead it, with new manager Charlie Batch and the new GM Joe Carletta.\n\n\"This was a time when we couldn't afford any of the things that we had on the farm,\" Steinbrenner said. \"We knew that in order to have success at the next level, you've got to give the best players, the best players the best equipment, the best coaches and then your own players. This is why we were able to go this way: This is where every group would work the same.\"\n\nIn 1940, Barrow joined the Yankees as their new assistant manager. While the team hoped to continue winning, Barrow and his team of five teammates would try to make it to the World Series. The Red Sox had never won a World Series in New York, but Yankees fans at the time thought they had been in the right place at the right time. So they flew to Buffalo to beat the Red Sox in Game 2 of the World Series for the first time ever over the Mississippi. The Yankees lost, but the Red Sox would never win back-to-back World Series titles for the next half century.\n\n\"There was a lot that needed to be done. There were the big decisions that needed to be made. This isn't what you put in the back office, but you have to do it. The decision to stay in one place and give your players the best and the best experience and make the best of it is kind of the only really difficult job you can take,\" Steinbrenner said. \"We don't want to keep it that way, not because someone needs to be sacked, but because we don't want to be that way.

{"id":1069,"ended":true,"length":492,"gen_text":"Typhoon Imbudo was the strongest typhoon to strike Luzon since Typhoon Zeb five years prior, and was the fifth storm in eight weeks to affect the country. The typhoon left widespread areas flooded, and over one million people were without power due to droughts.\n\nThe typhoon's winds increased to over 500 kilometers an hour and the maximum recorded rainfall to date was at 930 pm, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center advised people not to leave their homes on Sept. 27 because of concerns for the safety of their children.\n\nAerial video taken by The Associated Press shows two of the people who were swept away from their homes on Tuesday on the southern outskirts of Manila.\n\nCiting an emergency, state media reported that one of those people reportedly took off after the storm.\n\n\"This is our first-in-the-nation typhoon, but it's really the largest, and the largest, typhoon to strike, so there's really a problem,\" Zeb's driver Richard Pangino said.\n\nMeanwhile, Hurricane Raul, the strongest in the Southern Philippine Sea on Aug. 29, was on a break, with winds nearing 100 kilometers an hour, when it struck. It is presumed the storm will continue to track the coast across southern Philippines, which is currently on the edge of a typhoon-hit area.\n\nAs we watch the storm go by, we need to keep those who are hurt and those at risk in mind. Keep a watch out for emergencies. As #Raul moves up the coast, it will come. \u2014 Matthew Moller (@MWillerMoller) August 31, 2017\n\nIn the Philippines, the first typhoon to hit in over two years, Sept. 10 at the beginning of August, slammed at the Sulu airport in Manila, killing at least 29 people, mostly children. All three victims were believed to be under the age of 13.\n\nThe worst case of typhoons hitting the Philippines since the end of World War II was the 1983-85 Typhoon Haiyan, which left more than 13,000 dead.\n\nHurricane Maria's winds caused flash flooding in some parts of the northeast and Southeast of the country. The extent of damage, though, was minimal.\n\n\"This storm is completely unprecedented in modern history and the record is going to be great,\" said Andrew Johnson, executive director of Save the Children of Central America.\n\n\"We are seeing record rainfall. We're seeing tremendous, tremendous devastation. It appears to be the kind of thing that can be predicted before it happens.... That's why it's so good that we're monitoring this,\" he said.","token_len":561,"entropy":[7.2331,0.9745,10.0152,3.7852,9.8738,4.386,2.9418,6.4783,8.3534,0.0012,1.4299,2.2342,7.8153,0.1701,2.5081,3.8013,5.3601,4.0253,13.4288,0.1721,5.377,1.6479,1.8594,2.2611,2.3085,4.8197,4.7481,3.387,6.8461,3.416,0.1811,5.0787,0.4643,3.4519,0.6738,2.4817,0.7234,0.0025,4.5656,5.9263,6.7217,5.7373,1.1351,1.2862,5.1169,4.4664,0.3704,0.1736,1.0588,1.4802,0.3468,5.3922,0.0042,6.1971,0.0154,0.0009,1.6629,1.3505,0.0004,1.9678,1.5038,0.0038,2.6126,2.9322,3.4624,0.7918,3.0432,4.0988,0.6621,2.8245,0.0029,2.5916,2.6627,4.255,5.9108,1.8573,5.2355,1.1993,0.8991,3.8505,3.6671,3.5306,7.1935,1.7265,1.2449,0.0033,0.6115,3.4181,0.0117,0.2333,0.0706,2.4852,0.0053,0.0174,0.0006,0.2244,0.0004,0.3554,0.5777,0.0002,1.5552,3.169,0.7353,0.0084,5.3168,0.9608,2.5955,0.0025,2.9925,0.5553,0.0986,4.503,4.7762,0.0205,3.5262,2.561,0.4576,5.2263,2.5794,1.6524,0.9394,0.0568,1.4062,1.2215,0.8154,0.6416,0.0002,3.9764,4.2265,2.3636,2.7364,1.6741,5.7063,0.7629,0.0016,0.528,4.8004,2.9044,0.1621,5.0908,1.7163,0.6854,3.8352,0.2438,1.3884,1.7581,0.2881,2.6086,3.4374,5.304,0.813,3.7669,2.4529,0.0072,2.2722,0.502,1.1023,0.0002,5.4202,2.714,3.2997,2.7909,2.4978,5.0826,2.4426,1.3093,0.3896,3.9384,1.1923,2.8407,2.6051,6.6068,5.706,3.3536,2.634,2.0494,1.1835,1.6393,0.5064,0.0002,2.5706,3.6356,0.9442,3.2553,2.3213,5.4421,4.473,0.0767,0.2918,0.0338,0.1284,1.7444,0.0018,2.1042,2.7852,1.6469,0.8937,4.5494,2.9085,4.947,3.7625,1.7491,2.3611,2.4803,2.1359,2.3991,0.002,1.5759,1.5996,5.4676,1.5963,3.3114,0.6923,3.1157,2.5375,4.5072,1.396,5.5151,0.5977,2.3359,5.2026,6.6501,4.5001,3.1426,5.5317,1.0308,1.0726,0.428,0.0002,5.6299,0.0484,5.5936,5.7007,3.2348,2.7414,2.2273,1.8093,2.8793,1.5653,3.716,2.9804,0.257,3.3857,3.308,0.0162,3.5607,0.1423,1.7338,5.1722,2.3848,5.0845,2.3905,2.3267,1.6972,6.1716,1.6037,0.2016,0.0594,0.0007,1.4348,5.3112,0.4088,2.0375,1.387,2.7115,2.7085,6.4497,2.6294,1.5339,1.1703,1.9607,0.6369,5.1033,2.1321,2.7163,5.3288,2.8095,1.3203,1.6593,2.7372,0.9938,3.9402,3.9095,1.5145,1.9417,0.0081,2.1764,1.9131,0.0044,2.1669,3.0151,2.0066,0.5147,0.3081,0.0002,5.273,6.061,4.6671,1.2039,1.8493,5.2426,0.3678,0.1845,1.525,3.5955,0.3588,2.2673,5.9856,1.9389,1.2317,4.6979,2.5063,1.0587,5.0113,0.3825,1.156,0.9259,0.6308,5.6544,3.9059,1.3713,0.9761,0.261,5.317,1.4365,5.9848,6.2483,1.9399,0.0442,3.03,3.5926,1.5032,1.9481,0.7224,2.698,1.2098,3.9095,2.9879,1.6177,5.203,4.993,6.5821,0.1233,5.7632,3.9078,2.8225,0.562,0.0768,0.2848,2.663,0.0002,0.4643,0.0796,0.0002,3.8292,1.4424,1.1614,0.176,1.9492,5.0441,2.4055,0.0174,0.4205,0.7832,3.0149,3.0364,2.1998,1.0037,2.2217,5.5006,0.01,3.9145,5.148,3.1386,5.4855,0.003,2.9792,0.8968,5.16,4.9329,1.5209,5.5244,1.6812,5.0148,0.8839,1.8409,0.8923,0.5918,1.0291,0.0,4.9005,0.1237,1.7778,3.5544,1.0403,0.6226,6.5718,3.0785,1.7563,0.3721,5.1577,0.0401,0.2684,4.0808,0.9311,0.072,0.0016,3.4523,0.3832,0.4155,0.0002,1.8959,4.2591,5.1509,1.083,0.3693,3.6488,3.9151,0.7459,0.5408,2.6798,1.8355,2.3718,0.0012,1.3468,0.004,0.0639,1.4979,1.9919,4.535,3.0692,2.9511,2.279,2.2282,0.0003,0.69,0.3026,3.3678,1.6779,0.0037,5.2075,0.4133,0.1683,1.4435,1.4215,0.945,0.0002,5.4224,0.1226,3.2317,3.1992,2.7641,5.8962,5.6727,0.2789,0.9598,2.6215,0.9632,0.0155,0.3011,5.0855,1.9831,4.7444,1.7176,0.036,0.4591,1.4991,2.0297,5.6426,0.0792,1.7894,3.9874,2.211,0.2969,1.3871,4.3001,0.7285,0.5799,0.0002,2.7614,2.92,2.2817,0.8276,5.3882,2.982,1.4164,5.4079,0.8261,2.694,2.8788,5.4503,1.7202,3.4418,0.0522,0.9359,5.3596,0.8724,1.3734,5.6981,5.4942,0.1404,4.0502,0.086,0.0789,4.8396,0.3526,0.0282,3.8218,4.0432,0.6874,0.5496,0.6524,0.0002,1.7151,1.9705,1.8789,2.3934,4.7398,2.1035,3.2912,1.4698,1.2529,0.3059,5.0931,4.6681,4.1402,3.5539,1.6246,1.9692,5.8975,1.1263,0.2469,2.1163,4.5475,0.014,1.2351,0.5118,2.4746,2.327,3.2554,5.3849,2.1193,1.468,9.38,5.0322,0.7272,2.4262,2.2045,0.3796,1.2018,6.2335,2.2587,0.9279,0.7363,6.3632,2.1862,2.7442,0.4938,0.5898,0.1023]}
{"id":1445,"ended":true,"length":532,"gen_text":"A week after being upset by LSU, Alabama returned to Bryant \u2013 Denny and began a three @ - @ game homestand to end the season by defeating long @ - @ time rival Florida State in the BCS national championship game.\nIt was the fourth time this year that LSU had lost in BCS play. On Nov. 20, 2013, Louisiana State lost to Alabama 12-7 in the third game of the regular season. LSU was out of BCS action for six weeks following the team's loss in the first game of the season.\nI'm not sure it actually happens.\nWhen was the last time you played in BCS play? LSU was one of only a couple of programs with a combined home and away win record of over 30. Not one. LSU's road win streak is long: last year's was a total of 4 games while they won only five.\nOne of this year's three losses was a 4-2 loss vs. Arkansas and the other was a late-game, early-season loss at Tennessee.\nThere were probably 10 things I said LSU did wrong early in the season.. 2) Told me they weren't good enough on defense and 3) said they were not enough on offense.\nWe had some good defense earlier in the year (last year they didn't win a home game). The offense was so weak right at the start that we won five games (including one against a Top 25 opponent). 3) Told players we were going to lose the games so we got two days off instead. 4) Wasn't enough on offense that we even got to face one of the better teams in the country in our division.\nThis game was supposed to be a \"must play\". It was supposed to be their night in the \"must win\", at least in a little bit. We'll get to that in a moment. We didn't do it. They gave up three goals.\nIt felt weird playing for this team (2nd place at the bottom of the division) and getting so many shots when you are going down.\nI know that we could have done a whole lot better at this point in the season. It's not going to get better at the next level. What was that? I am not sure about the rest of you, but I think you can put everything you have into this one win and give your fans who are still living in Louisiana a good wake-up call that the program didn't really want to go over the top.\nIf you are going to throw it away, put everything you have into it. If you want to be a BCS champ, take a backseat to that team. It makes sense for LSU, but it doesn't make sense for me.","token_len":563,"entropy":[8.5194,1.0597,4.1372,8.909,1.443,7.7259,2.0419,4.7126,5.4002,0.4796,6.8305,8.384,8.8183,4.4439,4.5717,12.9052,2.9621,2.9407,14.4176,8.9278,5.7678,3.9929,8.3373,0.6846,0.0861,4.4445,3.9321,0.7716,1.6024,5.7961,2.4426,9.8521,8.3057,1.9469,1.8068,4.5725,8.2558,4.5363,0.9721,2.6797,0.884,2.7884,0.137,2.5162,0.4052,0.2114,0.5188,2.4095,10.5172,0.8295,2.1409,4.205,1.2032,1.7267,1.604,0.5524,2.8042,1.7014,2.0053,1.9183,2.7631,0.0054,1.0025,1.0404,4.2125,2.5196,0.0349,3.5281,0.2164,2.9557,0.1247,5.5372,1.9812,1.9842,1.1146,2.3379,5.4535,0.0264,1.908,1.2471,0.7959,5.6763,1.3208,0.2574,0.6619,3.2001,0.0599,0.7339,2.7818,2.6902,3.6568,3.7872,1.6317,0.0057,3.2935,0.8893,4.0644,1.2577,2.7652,0.6943,5.6977,0.045,1.8801,2.5961,0.6001,3.191,0.7084,0.3918,0.1198,0.6452,0.5941,0.8472,5.7493,2.6918,1.5458,0.7131,4.3448,6.3605,4.6882,2.0082,2.0747,4.9537,4.8653,0.0899,0.0372,0.0179,1.3642,2.9173,1.5382,1.7259,0.0045,0.8386,0.5092,5.1186,2.2272,4.5935,0.1667,2.4006,2.8007,3.0901,0.5939,3.6489,3.5711,1.0225,5.7798,5.2842,1.812,0.8033,2.1865,2.6982,2.007,4.4411,3.1688,2.2376,5.7509,4.2915,2.3527,3.1871,2.7198,5.2171,1.1695,0.6245,2.7727,4.5836,4.2757,4.9555,0.971,1.719,4.0606,2.8046,3.6515,0.11,3.8368,1.194,5.5092,3.5924,2.4549,2.2069,4.1707,1.0151,1.1397,5.3085,1.2485,5.9777,0.946,0.0036,3.987,2.188,1.3297,2.7197,4.9225,0.0831,2.3004,0.6395,5.1738,0.0869,3.8549,4.0731,2.0507,2.0446,0.6044,0.3595,5.4179,1.5478,1.4326,5.1134,5.3726,0.5251,2.316,1.3448,1.5833,3.9684,0.6091,1.1624,4.3137,1.9084,5.4784,4.306,6.0238,1.664,4.648,5.256,2.9336,0.702,4.7429,0.6321,0.3227,0.3199,7.6769,6.0334,1.6237,5.6989,3.4182,3.4106,1.8927,3.1692,0.0008,2.7691,0.5787,3.8899,0.8423,2.0061,0.678,0.0046,4.5369,0.9319,1.4634,2.7825,5.4479,0.6028,0.0766,0.5584,1.0459,4.7796,3.1995,3.1175,2.2004,4.4774,6.2727,0.6095,0.0466,1.2256,3.669,5.4283,0.4176,4.1492,3.6575,0.001,2.7934,1.2641,3.2263,0.2104,3.0492,3.1515,3.7173,1.0464,4.67,3.5798,5.6855,4.269,0.2547,1.0144,1.4733,1.8998,5.1773,6.0069,1.7183,3.3744,2.6354,3.0108,3.064,2.4303,4.7472,1.262,2.2962,0.958,4.6195,0.0246,2.5719,0.1334,5.9147,3.814,2.2555,2.5408,0.036,2.2016,3.0867,4.1289,4.0562,0.8618,4.0797,5.1141,5.8399,0.165,4.951,3.1653,0.924,0.0078,5.3581,0.7701,0.0002,5.2624,1.982,0.9964,4.8096,1.1875,4.3427,2.3735,1.2144,4.0411,4.6464,0.7138,0.4647,3.4916,0.7955,0.5131,0.2168,0.5739,2.2709,3.7772,2.4472,0.8055,0.9841,3.9542,4.1799,1.0912,3.6833,0.0019,0.2219,1.1652,4.338,3.4108,2.9151,2.5312,2.1822,0.8017,0.9453,0.0022,0.2472,5.8694,5.1159,3.2043,1.0068,6.3827,1.3438,0.7442,3.1136,5.6198,0.6197,2.3154,3.9644,5.5345,0.426,0.3456,2.9785,5.6706,2.3291,0.6112,0.6585,0.9846,0.1511,1.5818,0.2946,3.8333,2.6805,0.0006,4.1985,1.5039,0.5831,4.5646,4.6875,1.1265,3.1008,4.7604,2.8705,2.0032,3.4082,4.8291,4.4485,4.0041,4.0728,4.5255,1.0292,4.2229,5.5918,1.6416,2.6746,3.5827,1.8766,5.6915,0.2369,0.2153,3.241,1.7238,1.5304,4.0939,3.833,1.3141,3.0991,5.01,1.6034,3.7507,3.8998,3.1506,1.5983,1.7577,2.1914,3.1293,2.9036,3.8021,4.3114,0.4167,2.8403,2.1551,4.518,0.3546,0.217,3.7345,1.9046,0.6282,1.9971,0.3176,0.1133,1.0392,3.1031,1.678,1.8269,3.0463,0.0242,3.5802,1.5432,4.4803,1.6953,2.2645,0.2222,0.5262,5.4756,3.7222,4.9026,2.8404,2.8537,4.6375,1.2832,0.7212,4.3205,1.9736,3.1997,0.3249,0.8077,1.8143,0.2338,1.1495,2.0146,2.6958,2.6516,4.7973,4.7821,1.4149,0.707,0.63,1.3328,3.7678,3.4061,1.7118,4.7108,4.1143,2.6391,5.5344,1.8678,3.1846,5.3097,1.2172,4.2698,1.6667,2.8827,5.1893,1.4062,0.0017,0.0053,3.6951,3.0207,4.6757,5.2703,0.0004,3.4259,3.816,0.5272,3.158,5.6895,0.6954,0.4359,0.7362,0.6952,3.9724,0.8767,2.5184,2.263,0.042,4.7287,3.3237,2.0019,0.7691,4.2317,3.3052,0.4488,0.1324,0.1228,0.6212,0.3862,3.2828,0.3208,2.7562,0.3369,3.2708,1.6486,5.0723,0.0437,3.6536,0.4733,4.0135,2.3366,5.7965,0.485,0.1865,4.101,2.21,0.8083,3.2954,4.8914,2.4933,2.338,2.0266,3.0967,1.1788,1.3684,1.8451,0.0004,0.4682,0.2983,0.1713,3.1799,0.4211]}
{"id":2121,"ended":true,"length":493,"gen_text":"During the Lebanese Civil War and the Israeli occupation of South Lebanon ( 1985 \u2013 2000 ), the temple site was neglected and was invaded by vegetation overgrowth ; it was cleared and recovered by Israel in 2006. Today the temple site is home to many local traditions and to religious community leaders. In 2003 Dr. Khaavani was designated the 'first to be recognized by the international UNESCO Committee on the Nature and Environment of Lebanon'. In 2004 Dr. Khaavani was inducted into the International Women's Council, and in 2005 he was nominated as a World Heritage Design Award recipient. In 2005 the new head of the Ministry of Religious Affairs (Dr. Aqidul Rida) and the Minister for Women's Affairs (Dr. Shaiib Akram) visited the site. In 2007 Dr. Khaavani's ministry, under Dr. Aqidul and Dr. Akram, invited her to visit its site and to make the sacred sacrifice. In 2008 the local community decided to adopt a new religious name. Dr. Aqidul and Dr. Aqumu won the 2008 UNESCO Gold Medal, the highest honor any ministry in Lebanon. In 2009 Dr. Aqidul, like other women of the city of Ashdod held an event to honor the holy sacrifice of Dr. Aqidul: The Habil (Holidays and Eid al-Adha) ceremony. At the ceremony Dr. Aqidul carried the dead body of the dead's mother and uncle over her two heads. They were then brought as offerings to the saints who were waiting for her, and to the Holy God, and he gave them five silver pieces (each silver offering containing 1 gram) each by giving them five minutes on the day of the service. On the evening of the service his body was found in the house of a woman named Amal and three years later she was buried. Since that time a different burial has been planned by her mother and a relative. All three daughters of each family have been present at the events with the children saying that they were honored by Dr. Aqidul and her ministers; Dr. Aqidul says: \"When we first took up the idea of the holy ceremony, we did not know that we were going to do a ceremony on the holiest shrine in Lebanon. When we did ask one of the leaders to perform the religious ceremony, he said: 'We don't need to pay tribute to your daughter'. Now we are grateful that we did not go crazy and took this place. Nowadays we are even more grateful for this place because we feel that the shrine is holy and our community is proud that we have been here so long\".\n\nThis page was last updated on 21\u20137\u20132011.","token_len":564,"entropy":[1.9437,10.3052,3.6148,0.0495,4.1923,1.1,4.332,0.9539,0.4508,6.6037,0.0442,3.9434,12.6433,2.3556,3.3601,0.3756,1.656,12.4625,5.6521,0.9298,7.8771,1.7178,3.2707,7.6442,0.2316,12.006,6.0007,6.6147,9.5124,2.6364,0.6173,6.3868,2.0925,8.3534,1.2047,2.8352,1.2147,2.7999,0.7419,4.8577,2.1399,2.0262,1.8078,0.5278,2.7536,0.0022,2.9372,4.7368,5.0359,1.3164,4.2367,3.8374,5.7016,3.3108,1.0648,3.107,4.6819,6.6536,0.734,4.9609,4.8256,5.2515,4.5197,3.0352,5.5229,1.7429,4.388,4.3718,5.6132,2.7965,2.6369,2.4111,0.8969,3.9374,6.6806,1.9537,0.7516,1.222,5.152,1.0194,1.8847,0.1616,2.9246,1.5374,2.6679,3.0108,1.604,0.0439,0.9418,0.0134,0.0094,0.0024,0.8392,4.9122,0.0012,0.3195,0.2283,2.8507,5.5877,0.3275,3.7558,2.9804,1.9755,1.1803,1.3598,1.339,0.536,3.5721,1.2733,1.3695,2.9917,0.9291,4.8357,2.253,1.6412,0.788,2.1557,2.8169,2.4326,5.9783,5.0244,0.0851,0.3471,4.2624,0.065,2.4008,0.1445,2.718,4.4733,0.1242,4.1702,4.6281,4.2364,3.4297,4.542,5.5819,0.7058,2.845,1.0251,2.3788,1.8147,3.4418,0.8877,0.5164,0.4649,1.2172,0.0367,4.615,3.1491,5.5175,5.3187,2.1091,0.4286,2.3936,0.5486,1.1143,1.4738,1.6236,1.978,0.8526,0.0221,1.1856,0.0026,0.0088,0.0018,3.7947,2.7215,3.9925,4.0839,0.8489,0.0492,2.9281,0.2552,0.0149,0.0028,4.6958,0.6209,0.0036,2.1819,0.004,0.2411,5.4447,4.6627,0.2891,1.0156,4.8136,2.001,2.0872,2.0634,4.3073,2.686,4.8902,5.1339,1.0688,1.4848,1.1803,1.5826,5.002,2.4621,3.9532,0.1949,5.2536,1.4046,2.2064,3.3648,2.7484,2.3658,2.6295,0.0101,1.2589,0.0282,0.0096,0.0024,1.7043,0.1485,0.0017,3.0148,0.2158,6.7394,3.4275,5.7775,0.4086,4.3565,2.5298,5.1006,0.5626,2.4805,2.7909,2.5802,1.4584,6.6511,5.7203,3.1249,1.0821,4.181,1.1872,1.0645,1.0927,0.0027,0.7498,0.0101,0.1568,0.0033,3.241,5.7469,2.8281,2.9438,2.4025,0.9665,4.2072,1.5287,5.2799,1.5781,0.02,6.6064,2.5824,2.5265,1.6172,3.4087,1.2267,5.5069,4.9753,0.8126,1.6822,0.0224,1.0287,0.037,0.2367,0.0048,5.5053,3.348,5.8698,5.2715,5.1682,2.9089,4.9252,0.0519,2.7225,2.7064,1.6857,0.1107,1.6633,0.0081,0.7287,3.27,1.2583,4.4361,0.601,0.6752,1.3651,0.005,0.2351,0.0093,0.0295,0.0021,4.7597,1.9935,5.9493,0.996,0.429,1.8014,3.572,5.4994,1.999,1.7987,5.5281,4.5951,1.3423,6.9609,1.7597,1.2212,5.2762,0.9279,2.719,3.3244,6.4827,3.6088,0.5913,0.5282,5.3137,3.6915,1.4891,4.4811,0.7999,2.5197,3.4876,1.1417,3.4763,0.7657,5.2497,5.081,2.3791,2.7849,4.3632,2.4632,0.7366,5.5458,5.3361,3.0611,4.1217,3.899,3.2134,5.1265,4.5249,3.835,4.6271,1.9711,3.2449,5.4886,4.9223,0.6231,3.8413,4.3405,5.2668,0.8741,1.7624,0.3067,0.4804,4.2673,0.5534,4.0102,0.6005,3.7212,0.0824,0.2682,1.2394,5.149,2.7036,0.2275,3.9495,2.0508,0.5778,5.1596,0.371,2.2639,2.6153,2.3146,4.5572,2.237,3.4818,3.4997,4.9595,0.2251,1.6383,0.9081,2.8288,2.2474,5.1914,3.3592,0.2651,3.7717,5.594,4.5229,1.5443,0.2155,3.0392,3.9752,3.2108,3.4324,1.2633,3.6832,5.494,1.4659,4.6773,2.6537,4.3625,0.8477,5.1255,1.163,1.5283,0.7093,4.7579,0.8254,0.344,6.2652,4.7812,1.5888,4.9632,5.7044,1.0174,0.8515,2.0836,3.8492,1.4204,1.6916,0.0167,0.125,0.0067,0.0116,0.0017,1.071,2.9143,4.3143,6.0277,3.226,0.0049,0.4729,0.0115,0.0865,0.0019,4.0203,3.4829,0.9873,3.8425,2.1976,3.3085,4.8298,2.1756,0.8954,3.9293,0.3949,1.8062,3.0723,3.1192,0.9383,1.2266,2.619,0.0608,1.4853,1.3199,2.8188,1.0879,1.3073,0.029,3.7353,3.2947,2.8584,3.1355,0.8174,5.3532,5.5369,0.9172,1.5065,0.9801,3.9966,0.7983,3.521,4.6654,5.0602,0.3743,1.01,3.9143,2.2636,3.548,0.4297,4.9489,1.3766,0.5099,0.5753,1.811,1.618,0.3582,2.9183,3.075,0.0006,2.715,1.0713,4.2489,2.6237,0.2136,3.5622,3.4792,3.767,4.4992,1.2761,1.3926,5.0867,1.5768,1.8389,2.1106,0.7569,4.4615,5.77,1.4616,4.4108,3.2701,4.5423,2.2477,3.9919,3.7639,1.631,1.6098,5.3372,0.9757,0.9453,1.8893,2.0758,1.5019,2.1045,1.5707,3.3913,0.8596,2.1752,3.6882,0.7932,4.7893,1.1622,3.7955,4.2879,0.823,3.1706,3.5353,1.1161,1.6899,2.0307,2.8285,4.2316,0.1045,2.5445,1.7397,0.1,4.986,4.0726,1.67,0.8857,0.1722,0.3237,4.0805,7.6587,5.1023,0.6488,2.7283,0.846]}
{"id":1182,"ended":true,"length":528,"gen_text":"There were 112 deaths associated with the construction of the dam. The first was J. G. Tierney, a surveyor who drowned on December 20, 1922, while looking for an ideal spot for construction. The second was L. M. C. Boggs, a waterman who died while looking for an ideal spot for construction.\n\nThe dam was in the middle of a river, and required three people to build. Construction crews began digging during the day before sunrise and started to cut trees.\n\nThe bridge on the river, with its three steps at each end, could only accommodate one person. The bridge broke into four sections. On the other side of the bridge, the main roadway would collapse under the weight of the dam. Construction workers, with a shovel, filled them in with mud or sand, and they filled in a large metal ball with small quantities of water. These buckets were filled with water, and they gave away the weight to the owner, who got the weight from the shovel. It was never filled in using a pneumatic pump.\n\nThe dam collapsed at 11:45 a.m.. The first bridge in the river went up on October 9. As the bridge broke into a few pieces, workers began building new ones.\n\nConstruction crews began removing the steel beams, cables and bolts. When the bridge was finished, two trucks were parked on top of it. One of them had been broken down during the war, and the other had been found lying on the floor of its pit. The two trucks had been parked at the end of the bridge.\n\nThe bridge now had 728 feet of concrete, and it needed about 9 tons to complete it. The bridge, then only 11 feet in diameter, was on a track, and had been covered in piles of rubble. One truck, filled with garbage, was tied up in the middle of the tracks with the other two. No one was able to move it. People were caught in the crossfire over the bridge. The work was so dangerous that nobody was able to get out of the bridge.\n\nThe final bridge could be built in 10 years; at present it was overgrown with weeds and small trees. It would have required more work, and might make it more difficult to run construction on. The construction was delayed nearly 50 years, from the day the railroad had opened in 1893 to the day the railroad closed in 1893.\n\nThe dams had to be closed by the end of World War II. The dam had been in operation since 1942 with 10,000 tons of concrete. In 1943 it was completed, and its last concrete was destroyed by the Japanese. The dam is on the northeast shore of Lake Placid, near Lake Washington, near the railroad plant.","token_len":564,"entropy":[4.6341,9.9098,4.1062,5.7322,0.0147,2.1801,7.2164,0.2037,1.1657,5.7081,1.7508,2.2217,4.3899,3.1568,8.417,2.1665,4.9036,0.1767,10.2648,0.0513,0.4139,1.6256,6.9765,0.0449,1.6769,6.6219,2.6834,4.6824,3.4615,0.2897,5.1071,1.0059,2.909,5.4792,0.6135,3.4139,6.4954,1.2393,0.9438,3.2301,0.894,1.8654,1.0709,0.4113,4.6605,0.1622,2.9923,0.0346,4.4307,1.016,4.5844,3.7755,0.285,0.126,0.7733,4.7584,2.8294,0.5002,1.6148,2.6349,2.4625,0.0298,1.6783,0.2613,0.2296,0.2748,0.5977,0.1996,1.2595,0.0029,1.531,2.8544,1.214,5.1955,1.6431,2.9731,0.0128,0.9456,3.6416,1.9439,1.7787,6.3681,4.2227,4.4182,0.1826,2.7459,2.2069,4.2992,2.1561,3.8813,1.9295,5.8247,0.3856,1.8281,5.1893,2.3898,2.3247,4.7542,2.6618,4.7165,4.5393,1.7876,2.9153,0.0002,1.5175,4.9819,3.9108,0.6377,3.6775,3.1817,4.0159,0.6721,3.4621,5.646,4.2518,2.5875,0.2465,0.2065,4.3483,2.6893,2.7833,2.397,0.2889,0.8729,1.7511,1.9057,5.8938,3.9652,2.5972,1.8642,2.5318,4.0033,1.1312,3.5584,0.3687,0.8595,0.0407,0.3964,0.4568,1.7759,4.4702,5.3505,4.0073,5.1778,3.3771,0.881,0.3657,0.027,0.9599,2.2086,0.7401,3.8189,2.3853,4.5096,3.7904,2.8699,2.8222,0.4804,4.7074,5.3171,2.1888,1.7476,3.1492,5.1503,2.9595,1.7341,1.0754,3.9377,3.5572,1.5518,3.1521,3.6209,5.5527,5.0074,2.4016,5.9842,5.5429,0.007,2.16,0.5125,4.7213,3.381,1.3051,1.9313,0.4949,1.2935,1.8394,0.6849,2.0987,5.6654,3.5429,1.0787,4.5045,2.2825,1.0303,3.9899,2.6113,0.5055,5.5825,1.8289,2.7618,2.4826,0.7636,4.8627,0.4538,4.6697,0.6193,4.882,3.8355,2.6046,7.2386,1.9735,5.7556,1.993,0.0,2.3505,0.579,0.5835,0.0002,1.3215,2.5673,4.6471,2.9044,3.4425,0.4613,2.7271,0.3837,0.0004,0.0007,8.0608,1.7451,3.2001,4.1666,3.0007,0.561,1.8531,5.0597,1.8091,2.5137,4.12,3.42,2.1022,5.2657,0.8921,1.7633,3.249,1.8682,3.9207,3.4866,1.7429,0.2781,3.5531,2.294,4.7361,3.4656,2.32,0.5934,1.7714,0.0003,2.9973,0.9868,2.2058,3.9328,1.339,5.0616,3.2606,2.2636,5.8425,1.2331,4.5681,1.9287,4.2945,0.9255,1.3756,1.7707,2.1586,0.2682,4.9767,4.8498,2.2636,2.8649,1.6004,2.5246,0.0405,0.7859,0.7381,2.8424,1.0791,1.3175,2.7011,2.7502,4.6798,2.3354,3.4726,0.6825,5.3453,1.075,0.6313,0.9349,0.1466,1.8834,0.6886,5.11,3.5926,0.9261,0.3603,3.8243,1.6194,4.0436,5.0773,0.2167,1.5386,2.9978,0.7214,1.8023,0.922,3.8052,2.7043,0.7156,2.9261,0.0163,0.2986,0.4271,1.3591,1.098,0.0003,1.3672,1.6488,5.0608,1.5128,5.9356,4.8918,0.9455,0.1618,1.2681,1.1535,1.5608,1.9203,3.8528,3.2115,4.2634,3.7538,2.111,2.3927,2.0539,0.1288,1.4562,2.183,4.1764,5.5053,5.5603,4.0597,0.4034,2.7451,1.1655,0.065,1.2384,5.6511,1.8271,4.752,2.9223,0.9941,3.5073,2.3631,4.956,1.381,5.6778,0.1386,2.4596,0.7831,4.5445,2.9675,2.8393,3.95,0.0603,5.2198,0.2911,1.4144,5.1078,1.72,1.7624,0.8355,1.8529,0.2328,0.1376,2.8829,4.2913,2.6383,1.3648,2.789,1.9979,5.259,0.377,1.0398,2.2073,0.0054,2.8632,1.4077,1.1515,6.3837,1.5375,5.6,0.6152,0.3911,3.2725,0.0801,7.1723,0.5441,1.2106,0.7943,2.3052,5.1474,1.6099,3.1235,2.3508,0.3732,5.2523,0.8809,0.9446,0.0037,1.9423,0.5978,0.9114,0.3734,1.572,0.7414,0.6069,0.0002,1.3139,4.7116,1.1662,5.7779,2.2586,1.0286,2.1688,4.1326,0.6036,6.1782,4.2246,4.4213,1.681,4.2044,5.3275,1.3513,0.3766,1.9151,0.9102,5.2057,1.3887,0.3437,2.0634,2.0934,1.3168,2.3814,3.1763,3.2171,1.6916,1.2864,5.3612,6.2537,1.7186,1.8731,0.2332,0.5452,5.3758,5.2646,3.4156,1.7189,1.892,3.9256,2.9766,4.2939,6.1696,3.8862,0.1173,1.2417,4.4584,1.6654,3.3407,1.3253,5.8265,4.7439,2.0287,1.7564,4.6004,1.289,0.3979,0.6376,1.4267,2.5311,1.5175,0.7178,4.4638,0.1193,0.7608,0.0003,1.4196,6.0874,3.2983,2.9291,0.1983,3.331,3.1544,1.6837,0.8572,0.0022,3.3479,0.0019,0.4912,0.6529,1.451,2.6203,2.0532,1.6152,2.6332,1.206,1.398,3.698,5.7023,5.598,1.1663,0.4351,2.5696,0.0824,0.9585,1.4569,3.3456,3.4611,2.1282,0.5955,3.9245,1.5798,0.5824,3.9008,4.5674,2.8588,2.0407,4.3062,1.83,1.2176,2.5651,1.1426,1.6457,1.5772,3.2541,3.9828,0.692,4.8338,3.1991,0.0669,1.2198,5.6851,0.0014,1.094,2.2787,2.5285,4.0077,1.3961,4.1816,1.5204,5.4159,6.166,0.7208]}
{"id":3025,"ended":true,"length":508,"gen_text":"Bellaire's housing lots are 75 feet ( 23 m ) by 130 feet ( 40 m ), allowing for houses larger than those that could be built on typical 50 feet ( 15 m ) land.\n\nFor the new building, the proposed site is about 15 metres (30 meters) high and 10 metres (17 m ) deep.\n\nConstruction in April 2001 began a year-long process using land owned by the provincial government. About 60 of the 12 buildings were built. The previous five have yet to be installed.\n\nConstruction at Lander was originally funded by the North Central LRT program. The city has since spent about $2.6 million more than originally planned. The project cost North East LRT $2.5 million, with an additional $1 million through an online online funding site.\n\nCity officials said more than 80 per cent of the $4.4 million in additional funding received in February was used to make the changes, including the new development sites.\n\n\"We believe that this work will have the desired result,\" said Ed Bellaire during the development negotiations with Lander. \"The city deserves a great deal of this. We feel confident moving forward on a $4 million project based solely on building sites.\"\n\nThe $10 million site includes the new buildings' former site near the Lander, which will see a new community center, a parking garage and a retail development.\n\nAbout 20 buildings have been built at the site, including 610 residences and 3,170 units in homes. They include more than 1,900 residential units, a 3,000-space parking garage, a food and beverage centre, five retail buildings, 17 retail buildings and 1,300 housing units.\n\nThe site also includes a shopping and entertainment centre, with an expansion and remodel of a large parking garage to accommodate cars.\n\nAn additional 30 units of new residential and commercial parking are planned for the new site. A large storage facility is likely overused at the current site.\n\nLester said the changes at the new site will be good for traffic for the community.\n\n\"This means residents, transit users and other motorists will have more choice when taking their routes. This will also have a positive impact on parking garages and on retail locations, which is one of my biggest concerns with Lander,\" he said.\n\nConstruction also started at the new site near a new commercial station where 20 to 30 residents of three apartment buildings now live.\n\nThe proposed site is expected to be completed, with the project to take a new year for work in July 2003.\n\nTransit work on the new site is scheduled for late 2003 and early 2004, while the main development at the new site will take a two-year hiatus.","token_len":565,"entropy":[10.2688,2.8934,9.5892,10.7867,2.1763,9.0297,4.3603,3.7741,13.1026,1.43,0.6685,5.5629,5.5203,0.0279,0.0591,4.5312,0.0872,2.9781,6.5149,1.5366,7.5491,6.1032,0.0572,4.8117,3.8539,3.3568,1.1048,0.7451,1.7755,8.0218,7.4461,5.3595,0.4538,3.8625,0.0588,0.2605,2.7005,0.4385,1.3981,0.0303,4.6652,1.9417,4.9406,3.4432,0.5924,1.301,5.4647,3.3022,1.5904,3.1394,3.4685,6.6468,0.2084,3.7976,4.1028,0.0232,1.8551,1.0666,3.5855,0.1416,0.0419,3.9024,0.5586,0.3142,2.7747,0.6817,1.4382,0.0003,3.9403,4.7789,4.7347,6.2716,1.7568,4.6705,2.7222,0.7481,0.1922,1.642,6.3592,4.4543,3.8326,0.0523,1.3088,5.0976,0.3235,1.3972,5.4568,3.7695,3.9416,0.1742,5.3374,2.9925,1.3425,1.8849,3.2924,2.0807,5.2304,4.3063,4.0622,4.8684,0.0037,0.1461,5.4702,0.3588,0.3657,0.0003,3.1919,4.5851,5.7604,5.5184,2.9533,4.6184,4.7483,0.4115,0.7635,6.1149,4.628,5.226,3.2822,4.4163,1.3113,1.9187,3.9321,2.6857,2.9486,3.8453,1.3335,0.0536,3.0998,0.7144,2.2943,0.0802,6.0061,1.0023,2.734,0.8805,1.122,2.6712,2.4153,2.9004,6.3752,5.3622,0.9629,0.002,0.5775,2.712,0.0639,2.1793,0.0977,2.0381,2.7575,3.222,0.4477,0.0631,0.8061,1.2095,6.0763,3.8665,4.3897,5.3748,4.3568,3.2965,0.4513,0.5035,0.0003,4.925,2.3453,1.7944,5.6244,0.4776,3.5952,1.1233,0.0007,0.0216,0.3292,2.3686,3.2015,0.1673,2.4292,0.2154,1.8218,3.6478,0.8373,4.9605,2.4383,4.2613,2.3716,2.4151,0.4673,4.4953,1.2136,5.4011,3.0068,1.8437,2.1403,3.351,4.2574,6.3154,0.8972,0.4499,0.0003,2.444,1.6328,4.0788,1.2529,2.0298,5.3509,0.9343,3.4433,2.5311,2.1742,2.1935,1.779,0.6336,5.844,6.0477,0.01,6.4948,1.8291,3.9944,5.2821,2.6587,3.2391,0.3437,1.1162,0.779,2.1949,2.868,6.0454,1.9844,3.1125,1.008,0.7309,3.362,3.6811,1.323,4.548,3.3507,7.8534,0.0647,3.5256,3.1429,5.5517,1.1199,1.7884,0.8282,5.8255,2.8213,0.0436,6.1925,4.7316,1.5316,0.1998,0.0002,1.4901,4.3944,4.5308,1.0658,4.429,4.0837,2.573,2.6246,5.0404,3.3454,5.5353,4.6068,5.4384,1.116,2.9618,0.4241,5.6148,2.4404,2.5372,5.8061,2.0379,1.6151,5.0135,1.1743,1.3096,1.7323,4.0672,1.0697,0.8341,1.0042,4.1638,3.6256,0.7806,0.6097,0.0002,5.1355,3.0767,3.4556,2.3004,0.5325,0.9417,1.4779,0.5313,0.8259,1.4498,1.0834,10.437,4.0623,1.2848,4.6759,0.1163,6.394,3.0477,3.6728,5.9308,1.008,4.9526,0.9036,5.1129,0.0193,2.2389,0.02,3.9257,3.4135,0.166,0.9596,3.2384,4.0528,0.0713,1.3808,0.1604,3.2969,2.0383,0.3593,0.7261,1.1011,5.1576,2.5399,0.2001,4.7723,0.5704,5.5725,3.1677,2.9753,0.7216,6.0421,3.0874,2.5248,0.7959,3.9574,0.1175,2.9208,5.1629,0.0296,0.2192,0.3071,0.0002,1.2839,3.4374,1.6882,0.2375,1.1427,4.5078,3.254,1.581,1.786,0.73,4.7414,2.6927,4.7741,3.6995,4.4757,1.4775,1.5389,1.9912,4.6836,2.373,0.9634,3.5833,0.8988,5.6402,0.9845,0.4886,0.0002,5.04,1.446,5.1564,2.5116,1.8899,3.5129,2.0765,2.3261,0.6838,5.1505,2.1814,0.6626,1.478,0.3573,2.2032,0.9355,0.5365,4.0196,4.4197,5.4527,1.5474,1.2255,6.8351,6.7308,2.8081,2.5703,0.7889,4.4371,0.7752,0.6355,0.3492,0.0002,3.3984,5.5265,2.505,0.9061,4.6708,2.9289,0.7112,1.7638,0.2283,1.0448,2.4027,5.4743,0.4263,5.6308,4.9398,0.9772,3.7618,1.0998,0.4781,0.0002,0.4364,2.4656,4.6349,5.7156,3.5817,4.8878,1.113,0.6633,3.7242,3.7845,0.7223,2.0216,2.1379,2.6611,2.3891,5.6679,2.4069,3.869,3.0875,2.183,1.0863,1.766,3.7073,0.975,0.7407,0.6171,0.0656,4.3411,5.4997,0.0035,1.0156,3.7538,5.0796,3.1747,2.5551,1.2313,3.061,3.1335,0.2852,4.6123,2.2736,0.7091,2.28,2.4437,0.2403,0.561,0.7658,0.0218,0.0315,0.3461,0.0002,4.3827,3.9293,4.1249,1.6803,0.6932,1.4388,0.2893,3.7822,4.1538,2.8472,4.3893,4.7373,5.0003,6.1076,3.8605,0.4342,3.4849,3.6502,5.4886,5.3902,0.7763,5.1023,0.7927,0.3868,0.6602,0.0002,1.4459,4.3198,1.0383,1.5454,2.955,0.003,1.18,1.3038,7.6136,1.0721,1.3973,2.8596,3.2836,3.5071,3.303,5.3386,3.8886,5.295,4.9544,3.335,3.8039,4.218,0.1984,0.7657,0.0003,5.5334,0.8545,5.688,3.2091,0.2606,1.0226,0.5258,1.8072,2.2418,1.9986,2.8075,1.9528,2.1304,1.0137,0.0543,1.3513,3.4594,1.2999,4.705,4.3824,3.0704,0.4623,1.7479,0.0771,1.3937,1.0599,1.3034,4.6703,0.1153,0.2004,2.6453,0.6349]}
{"id":3361,"ended":true,"length":516,"gen_text":"Filming took place over a 13 to 14 days period in December 2001. It was not filmed on order of the script ; the scenes set around the Osbourne residence for instance, were shot in September 2001 in which the house is shown to be filled with a variety of furnishings.\n\nIn other words, the real estate owners were acting for the landlord in their own words: as they could not show that there were tenants living within the premises, or that the apartment was being built on any terms.\n\nThese tenants included housewives and house servants, and were paid for their services.\n\nA note issued after being informed that the new landlord had no intention of evicting the tenants, says: \"It would be interesting to see if tenants would see this as the normal state of affairs for tenancy law now. This has long been the theme in housing issues in the UK and it is thought some tenants may have received a benefit for it.\"\n\nA further response came from David Cawford QC, who said: \"This isn't the first time tenants have complained about some of the landlord's actions. Last year a landlord was evicted in Westport and on several occasions tenants from the premises described the landlord's eviction as being so tough\".\n\nIn 2005 an owner of a residential property in North London complained about the eviction, arguing, he believes, because the apartment was now owned by other tenants. However, despite his complaint, the landlord continued to provide tenants with services, including rent and utilities.\n\nIn February this year, a landlord at the house of James James of Ashford said he was evicting tenants for \"stealing\" belongings and \"stealing property\".\n\nTenants, who claimed to the National Housing Authority, also claimed their properties had been bought by landlords with \"the intention of taking over their homes\".\n\nBut in a case that has never occurred, the national rights organisation Shelter has reported a case of alleged burglaries involving an apartment in London by tenants.\n\nIn 2000, a resident of one-bedroom homes in London was given a notice to vacate for breaching its occupancy order, which said tenants had their own dwelling units until six months after they left the premises.\n\nA third court case was seen by Shelter last year.\n\nWhen you rent out an apartment, you can expect to pay up to \u00a32m in maintenance costs by way of fines,

{"id":3181,"ended":true,"length":492,"gen_text":"Still believing that the ROK 1st Infantry Division was tied up at Unsan, PVA Commander Peng Dehuai gave the go ahead for the 39th Corps to destroy the Unsan garrison on 1 November.\n\nHowever, that did not stop the ROK 1st Infantry Division from destroying the Unsan garrison with heavy losses from Kourou and Koshien, as the Rok 1st Infantry Division did not have sufficient firepower to handle the heavy losses. PVA commander Peng Dehuai and ROK commander Dong Hoang ordered the attack on Unsan and were met with heavy casualties. Peng Dehuai and ROK commander Dong Hoang were unable to control the firepower of the 39th Corps and consequently their assault on Unsan on 1 November failed to cause the rout with a loss of more than 500 men.\n\nFollowing the successful engagement with the ROK 1st Infantry Division the ROK military forces moved out with the help of several large forces and began to push forward, hoping to advance against Unsan. As part of their push, however, the ROK commanders were stopped from attacking Kourou Province by the enemy's forces. The fighting continued in this way for several days, with the ROK commander and the Koshien garrison being wiped out in a single night. From 6 to 7 November, the 40th Infantry Division fought in battles of 5 to 10 days on the frontlines against the enemy.\n\nThe 48th Infantry Division's fighting position in Unsan on 1 November, is shown below. The division had planned to leave Unsan due to heavy losses as they had lost more than 70 men. The regiment would continue to fight at Unsan until 24 November when the ROK forces reached Unsan, then retreated to the north end of Nantou after their forces had been pushed back by ROK troops. PVA commanders were in the process of completing construction of a new fort on the Unsan coastline.\n\nThe 48th Infantry Division is one of many army divisions which will not hesitate to fight during the time that it is under heavy pressure with the addition of reinforcements due to their heavy losses during the past days.

{"id":4570,"ended":false,"length":557,"gen_text":"The Laborers International Union represented the bulk of the less @ - @ skilled labor on the project. Laborers, as they were commonly known, did most of the odd jobs on the side project. The other workers were the new owners of the equipment and other equipment needed for construction of the new office building. But the equipment workers still had to keep the roof in place while building new offices. The building's own design and history would make this simple. As part of this plan and when the new office didn't work, the rest of the workers were put on a permanent standby to stay for a significant period of time or else have to go to the emergency room or die of exposure to the fire. While doing so, they had to move to a different work area or stay behind on what they were supposed to do. And they were also required to clean out their place of the garbage and other waste from the new office building (as they can do in any building from time to time ). So what will they do, and what can they do to get the building to work properly? This is not the solution yet. We have a lot of questions for you. We have to make a call. You can send us details, like last week's comments, or post your comments to this blog. Here is where the answer to one of the questions comes: The plan will not work right with the way it is now. But, what if the workers were forced to go to a different work area, or stay on where the garbage had already got trapped? If so, that would be great, and we can begin building even better office facilities like a new headquarters and a new building in our city. The first phase of the office building project was the removal of the garbage on our building, as well as the relocation of garbage at the offices. The first large garbage dump we did was in September, and we didn't do it right. No one's right. Let's make that part of this part a priority over the second. The first time we did this, it was with the addition of the new offices, but you know we could bring people in and make sure they didn't have any other use at all. No one's right about that. The second time was with getting rid of the broken glass on the office, but you have to live with it. When you get rid of all the broken glass, there isn't any place for a new office now. We did everything we could to make sure our new office works safely and cleanly. So we took care, and kept the windows closed to make it not be a problem for employees. No one was hurt, but it took us a lot of time and effort!\nPosted by nyc - 7\/23\/2012 at 6:11 PM","token_len":568,"entropy":[10.4484,4.7654,6.2564,1.438,8.1936,2.0147,6.7339,0.0039,0.5624,9.1315,18.0896,9.3381,7.3952,8.7962,2.5179,4.5071,1.3387,5.6987,0.9016,7.9064,0.0789,4.1113,3.9208,3.4914,2.8407,6.0224,1.135,0.287,3.6776,4.9462,0.0663,0.1571,10.6014,0.5752,3.5271,0.6141,5.4137,3.3664,0.6911,2.472,4.1448,3.2358,1.1254,2.73,5.6215,3.8856,0.7997,0.2816,4.5681,1.7937,4.2781,1.8081,2.7747,1.2851,4.7295,2.2059,0.2488,3.2038,4.6317,1.4374,0.4018,4.7575,1.7905,5.6999,5.1059,5.0954,1.9061,0.8413,4.8653,1.6994,5.0436,3.812,0.2585,4.448,2.5119,4.6633,1.5962,0.7687,1.963,3.5723,2.8901,5.275,5.2975,2.5418,5.671,3.9685,3.2341,2.1341,5.828,1.8468,4.3458,4.4343,0.0029,2.5856,4.0757,5.0746,5.345,1.1281,2.6359,1.3142,6.6674,0.0009,3.4584,0.894,0.8423,5.2738,0.1385,0.1286,1.5114,2.0864,4.0798,1.4973,2.1035,4.8885,5.6786,2.3717,4.4309,4.5278,1.9952,6.9106,0.863,0.2338,0.0121,4.8973,4.7046,4.2242,0.4775,2.5353,1.9738,1.4486,3.8957,0.5152,2.6227,4.1659,3.5365,3.8661,1.2341,1.7399,3.2958,0.52,5.2669,5.7421,2.3634,0.3518,1.6245,2.8186,0.1896,4.6687,1.9435,1.563,1.5719,4.8251,1.1553,2.1833,4.0566,4.3633,3.2221,5.8507,1.5401,1.5888,2.8658,0.0005,1.1444,0.7091,3.9827,3.0089,1.7396,3.2404,2.1324,0.0318,4.5194,2.6488,2.2539,5.0603,0.5203,5.3823,4.7945,1.8154,2.2532,3.3381,3.2303,0.4824,2.9658,0.9546,0.8186,4.6609,3.7927,2.3783,5.8205,1.9782,2.0431,2.951,1.2757,6.1103,3.7464,0.0656,0.0007,6.6979,3.2564,3.9294,5.9295,2.8791,0.2211,4.5649,3.006,1.1562,2.8998,0.5099,0.1118,1.4249,2.9299,1.9546,3.0304,1.8464,1.4094,2.0881,0.7684,3.9651,1.0069,3.2902,2.6559,5.5451,6.0586,0.5884,3.655,2.0491,2.3015,1.954,0.2842,3.0107,2.9886,1.5126,1.4686,2.6921,2.0238,2.2085,3.6695,3.0193,4.1513,1.6079,3.8528,1.1033,3.0075,0.8282,7.1353,3.396,5.7566,5.8433,1.7731,0.1935,3.6236,1.1631,1.5938,4.8774,1.5199,1.6396,2.3039,2.3906,2.8721,0.9374,4.4492,1.338,3.6756,2.769,4.705,1.5362,5.1115,0.3878,0.8842,1.4186,1.3867,4.7847,3.2062,5.2698,3.9378,2.6807,1.8329,5.5959,4.7636,0.9216,6.2032,2.3076,1.114,2.0469,0.621,4.5189,2.8384,4.3426,2.6619,1.7542,3.9349,2.845,3.3003,0.1408,2.8493,1.0571,2.1191,0.3392,0.9409,0.0868,2.1347,1.31,3.1886,3.0358,5.3144,2.6342,1.3591,3.6337,2.4266,5.5189,5.4051,1.0266,3.44,1.8196,0.0473,3.6473,1.0109,1.4403,3.5748,1.8953,1.8999,2.5359,2.2796,5.0183,3.4448,6.0393,0.7924,2.2452,4.4943,4.9411,2.4548,1.6262,4.1762,2.7155,2.1413,0.6649,2.4144,3.5503,3.902,2.9371,0.4956,2.5037,4.6476,5.0509,0.4729,0.9555,5.2493,1.2671,1.5414,2.3434,3.5004,6.0965,0.0758,1.004,2.0397,4.3318,4.4252,2.5409,2.3522,3.7718,1.2118,0.02,0.913,5.6969,0.1261,4.3458,5.3274,0.6476,5.1602,0.7913,1.7483,3.5301,6.0506,4.9487,1.498,4.6919,1.5895,0.7657,1.4015,4.5854,2.5834,2.0437,1.6588,3.9516,0.0009,2.8126,1.5146,2.7309,1.0743,5.9982,0.5111,5.1993,4.4468,1.8886,5.827,0.2546,3.4983,3.118,4.2098,0.6066,2.088,4.0244,2.3952,3.4004,6.6446,1.2234,3.7473,2.0137,1.7808,1.834,3.8143,0.478,1.2021,1.2416,0.6333,2.236,0.6602,3.3784,1.0958,5.2591,0.0088,2.1201,1.7937,3.5188,2.0936,2.4066,5.6565,2.7879,3.5827,4.2517,6.9118,4.9118,1.6314,1.7447,3.2618,1.9778,1.3925,2.6125,0.0006,1.5425,3.122,3.8715,4.8637,4.3103,1.9207,0.3384,5.5557,0.364,0.9207,0.4258,4.0704,0.7227,0.4088,2.1738,1.723,0.869,2.5415,1.6724,6.2671,2.2473,0.0049,0.4859,6.5069,2.0068,2.0067,0.3195,3.1479,2.7709,1.4799,2.3495,3.7291,0.2041,5.4106,0.1324,1.7371,0.6185,4.5692,1.657,2.6955,0.6848,0.0018,3.6988,0.8212,0.8298,0.1416,0.5884,3.0606,4.3012,0.0002,1.9802,2.6966,1.2011,3.8126,2.0325,0.4224,6.0056,0.4463,2.303,3.531,5.0092,0.4721,0.1072,0.3217,1.6056,0.3799,3.9142,1.4643,1.0779,5.0986,6.5319,1.0239,3.1222,0.0623,0.5524,3.226,1.8461,4.1434,3.3749,5.6707,1.4179,5.6174,1.4299,2.4809,2.3877,3.2634,1.9361,2.8504,5.3582,3.5172,1.3345,1.7649,2.4412,4.6062,0.8484,5.0651,0.3713,2.7348,1.6672,1.4887,1.7151,2.6346,3.1455,1.7822,0.861,2.096,0.2603,0.8141,1.2269,0.9061,6.6032,4.4165,1.0645,0.0228,5.8481,2.7188,2.5409,6.2523,3.7692,3.1533,3.3547,0.007,2.3257,0.3112,2.7151,0.0002,3.9658,0.9642]}
{"id":4194,"ended":true,"length":522,"gen_text":"Fossett was a lifelong mountain climber and had climbed the highest peaks on six of the seven continents. In the 1980s, he became friends with Patrick Morrow, who was attempting to climb Everest after discovering the top in the Himalayas. But Morrow was convinced by Reiser's report of a mountain he would spend the winter in.\n\nWhile reaping the whirlwind, Reiser discovered that the top of an abandoned mountain was actually made up of huge boulders. During his trip through the hills to see this hidden treasure, Reiser made four trips across the country that culminated in his discovery.\n\nHe visited some of these abandoned mountain slopes with two of his buddies who were hiking the slopes and he met up on a topography tour with Reiser, with Morrow. A few of Reiser's buddies then returned later on. As a result of their trip, another pair of them became climbers too, with Reiser climbing them after a couple hundred days together. He then got some more experience working with Reiser, and again in a couple dozen more days.\n\nHowever things got out of control after Morrow reported that he found out the top in the Himalayas. A climber from the top of the Himalayas found out about his new adventure when Reiser went to check on him, where they found out the top in the mountains was also made up of great boulders. Not only that, the rock had been broken down during the trip. Reiser then had Reiser climb the next highest of them at\u00a0the\u00a0Kirby Glacier that included\u00a0his new destination of\u00a0the valley of\u00a0The Lake of the Holy Grail.\n\nIt would be an adventure that Reiser would have been proud of. The climbers had climbed up on top of their campsite for the long distance, at the top of the peaks all their life, which was then used as a base to test the new theory.\n\nHe would also be proud of that fact for sure because there was a lot of evidence of the same. There was one major case of people trying to climb the same summit by hand for a hundred days, in the 1960's, with Reiser. Reiser's buddies also tried to get some of the new information that they might make with their new friend.\n\nWhen you're not helping someone, you can put everything forward for good. That is certainly the case with Reiser and the others who tried on the world's top 10 top. They had to face down some more hard odds than just climbing. Reiser took his place on the top 10.\n\nFor people who are hoping to achieve top 10 and then are on their hands and knees that there are really only so many more places to go at one time, please visit the Top 20 Top 20 Articles page of our website.","token_len":574,"entropy":[8.1651,5.3162,3.86,2.7323,5.7738,8.629,1.8654,0.0,1.2794,3.9995,3.0852,1.8967,3.1554,1.0876,3.0156,6.6756,4.0789,0.9983,2.0413,0.6911,1.3149,3.1566,2.6172,3.2248,0.1194,0.5686,0.398,2.6952,5.9337,0.0089,7.4474,8.9263,0.4422,1.5366,1.6651,6.7357,0.6484,1.4295,1.9617,4.2999,4.9684,1.9145,4.6769,4.4445,2.4405,1.3829,0.0701,0.0003,0.3109,4.5293,2.3371,1.7839,4.2021,2.9247,5.9331,5.6352,0.9501,5.1669,3.296,1.7278,4.1977,3.5,5.2393,6.3884,0.9582,4.3694,1.1267,1.8517,1.2757,0.0006,5.3281,3.5381,2.2138,0.3649,5.4187,1.7604,0.4743,0.0004,3.909,1.3154,1.5802,3.6892,0.6651,4.513,3.8542,1.5741,1.8624,2.7446,5.1296,1.5561,0.1027,5.8581,1.2726,0.0015,1.0508,6.5537,2.1213,2.8481,4.0538,0.5169,4.9081,3.4311,2.8208,3.9728,4.4344,2.219,0.1611,0.5712,0.0002,4.8475,5.6683,1.3246,2.9867,0.4992,2.511,4.6305,3.6096,0.1582,2.0208,3.0547,1.0584,1.2095,0.0002,3.3798,5.2287,4.0996,0.2414,1.3379,3.0548,1.6639,5.7012,3.4318,5.251,1.2544,0.2178,3.9882,3.6218,1.4025,3.7392,2.2056,4.192,3.0216,3.6666,3.5469,2.4937,5.8642,1.5228,5.4552,3.3239,1.7457,1.579,1.8918,0.0004,2.7792,5.1626,4.173,1.4549,5.0825,1.5045,2.8997,1.9285,0.0004,0.004,2.756,3.6851,4.396,5.8146,3.579,2.3585,4.7597,2.9742,0.7979,0.8468,2.6437,2.7944,0.3042,7.8491,4.1076,0.2108,4.6783,3.1537,3.0494,5.3876,1.7693,2.6497,0.7099,0.0005,2.6325,3.1348,4.8567,3.181,2.8352,5.6276,4.1017,5.9716,0.3072,3.9623,2.5202,4.1834,4.0231,2.7929,2.2732,4.8051,0.97,0.9413,0.0026,1.9241,1.6588,4.9366,3.1745,3.705,2.2826,5.2143,1.9818,1.4765,0.7793,0.4917,0.0002,5.6161,7.911,2.235,2.848,0.0445,1.9949,3.3853,3.2085,4.5391,2.2381,2.5825,3.426,2.5793,2.6682,1.007,3.2254,0.726,0.3681,0.0206,0.0029,1.6302,4.534,5.2733,0.0025,3.0231,1.8921,4.7482,0.561,1.4473,2.2355,0.0282,0.0153,4.3534,1.0704,1.419,3.547,4.8174,4.3119,3.232,1.0878,0.0002,3.7806,0.9579,2.814,1.2486,0.8922,2.494,5.0498,3.3307,1.012,1.5186,2.4048,1.0614,2.0724,0.519,2.2448,1.6582,4.8218,0.9793,0.3757,0.03,5.7529,0.3667,0.0073,0.2416,6.1634,0.6397,1.4162,0.0548,3.0429,4.0714,3.0691,1.1698,3.5703,2.6062,4.8272,1.0809,3.7143,1.3023,1.727,0.0006,2.8307,3.761,3.3421,0.0014,2.4197,1.5283,4.1491,2.8158,3.2681,2.7513,4.7956,9.7135,3.2297,2.4565,4.1394,4.5205,2.4123,3.2298,4.985,6.2074,2.805,5.4474,2.9575,3.6561,2.8271,2.441,1.6816,5.9867,0.9906,2.1873,3.8544,5.563,1.0309,0.8217,5.2203,1.7106,0.5018,0.4798,0.0013,3.9388,4.0785,0.9116,3.6254,2.5759,1.4367,1.4572,0.0005,1.1574,2.2851,3.0337,1.2339,0.3301,1.2249,3.3265,5.2915,2.9105,3.4244,3.6845,4.7231,1.5855,0.1199,4.382,6.0419,0.3618,3.7992,1.9382,5.3469,3.9422,1.7078,5.7455,1.8105,3.2858,0.1316,0.8613,4.2938,5.3954,5.3109,2.9746,1.3086,4.5635,1.5917,4.6587,3.882,0.7768,0.4294,1.3776,2.1723,4.9348,1.6174,3.597,5.6707,1.7382,1.5791,0.0006,4.3816,2.2625,2.2304,1.9371,0.5538,0.3573,3.6861,3.1146,5.8487,4.4433,4.8417,4.2671,1.0941,1.6671,2.8312,0.2957,2.6666,2.0668,1.7114,4.27,2.8643,3.885,0.8969,3.983,5.0152,4.9589,0.7461,4.4099,4.3698,0.0421,0.8137,1.3831,3.0225,3.3568,5.4538,4.2612,3.9346,2.3249,4.0306,1.2304,1.6017,3.7196,2.0241,4.8555,3.2084,1.4991,3.0788,3.0907,0.0007,3.279,3.6211,0.0013,2.5643,4.0768,2.9775,3.1365,0.6117,2.8993,3.9127,1.5781,0.8892,4.0179,3.2408,2.8647,1.9331,5.2652,7.1084,3.4297,2.0754,1.2223,4.7772,1.3949,1.0276,0.0002,4.0749,4.679,3.28,3.7325,5.4687,2.7995,1.5355,0.9432,2.0028,5.7062,4.8705,5.4824,3.1892,5.1579,1.1695,3.7126,2.0027,6.1241,1.4834,0.6217,0.626,0.4645,0.0008,2.4268,2.944,2.0597,1.3962,3.278,5.93,1.7557,5.0446,0.3276,2.2441,4.959,4.8449,5.3143,3.302,3.2301,2.4919,3.8631,4.6679,3.5502,5.8905,3.0451,2.9212,2.2618,2.7613,2.5757,3.2778,3.0653,0.0016,5.1283,2.9315,4.8392,1.4689,0.3477,1.6305,1.1623,2.198,0.6405,0.0004,4.4083,5.6292,0.855,1.8586,5.5803,0.4979,4.6507,4.9184,0.5354,3.5391,4.7811,5.3319,4.6462,1.4193,7.3152,0.6177,0.0075,4.8445,5.2603,1.7905,5.8153,1.8352,3.8519,0.0125,4.396,3.6609,0.761,1.5502,5.3899,3.0514,0.1374,0.47,5.5731,4.3639,1.8225,3.8918,3.9489,2.6809,2.1375,5.3385,2.7553,3.3206,2.2716,1.189,0.6021]}

Contact him at mike@mikekratz.edu. His research interests coincide with regional transportation issues of the day. This essay explores what North Wilmington Expressway, P Street, and eastbound US 202 appear to offer for commuters in those circumstances: the potential to connect Wilmington and the South for a new commercial world where transportation is increasingly an important transportation feature.

{"id":615,"ended":true,"length":536,"gen_text":"The Food Album has received mixed reviews from most critics ; many felt that while the album was amusing it was not an essential release. Allmusic reviewer Johnny Loftus awarded the album three out of five stars, citing its \"no-nonsense approach to the genre\", while others agreed that the album was lacking in any memorable or interesting character.\n\nAnnette's debut album, a compilation of music from her life,''\n\nAnother reviewer said of her albums: [T]he book is not designed to be a stand-alone collection where you don't have to give up what you're working on to make something new. The book feels so unique that people who were familiar with it could have a better understanding of how it was done.... She was the first of a number of female artists to do it. As a feminist, I can't say the same about the album, which has received less critical praise than most feminist songs in the past, and the fact that it's about women, and there's so much to talk about.\n\nA woman who has said she won't support a female artist in public, said in a 2015 review that'A woman who has said she won't support a female artist in public, said in a 2015 review that'I'm already being asked to sign one of the most controversial male musicians to the public's lips with the title 'The Sex Pistols','and we will make the best of it - no one is going to get hurt the same way over a two-tone horn. '\n\nTaken together, three releases from the now defunct Black Cat\/Black Dahlia and seven albums of black music from the same era - 'The Sex Pistols','The Electric Light Orchestra, and their respective'Black Cat II'- is the definitive history of Black Cat in the music world.\n\nIt didn't take long before many fans took to Twitter to call for Black Cat fans to stop supporting the band (despite not having any direct involvement with the band before this controversy).\n\nThe 'black cat' controversy\n\nThe song which took the most vitriolic fire over at the time was \"Black Cat: The Musical Moment \". It made about as much of the backlash as 'The Sex Pistols', which even featured lyrics by the late Nirvana songwriter Jim Morrison. Though 'The Sex Pistols' came off as a hit and the band has since released three albums since, it appears to be now a distant memory.\n\nHowever, it has been a divisive issue. Many fans are unsure how the band has been treated this year since its last release - and have questioned whether their fans will be willing to pay the price if they can't understand how the band plays.\n\nI really hope this doesn't turn into a long conversation. I hope this doesn't turn into a long discussion.","token_len":575,"entropy":[9.4636,14.0364,4.8144,4.326,3.9445,0.2287,1.7339,5.414,3.306,11.612,4.6432,5.5818,0.7584,5.8091,1.1879,0.885,1.4557,7.9754,4.0729,0.8741,1.2394,4.4308,4.7993,6.5785,1.6018,6.4976,6.6063,5.9836,7.831,8.6222,0.9406,8.2383,0.6905,0.2121,4.1086,1.2068,0.0025,0.4552,0.1238,1.4913,3.5246,1.6041,2.1481,5.0607,1.8774,1.2908,0.003,2.5688,0.4746,2.2091,3.7963,2.5733,3.2744,3.0301,5.6496,0.7202,1.1426,0.7073,0.9002,5.2787,0.4529,3.5758,5.8017,2.7151,3.1747,4.0898,1.3815,1.5739,0.0107,5.6145,4.3033,2.5907,4.1036,0.4085,1.0814,5.6938,4.1712,0.3697,4.3041,1.0567,1.748,2.96,11.2233,5.7248,0.0003,6.6656,2.7248,2.8985,4.0975,3.0504,4.5494,1.302,8.8168,3.9979,0.2252,0.3705,5.5302,1.5919,3.1339,5.414,0.5874,1.0388,1.3189,5.1454,0.1902,0.0225,2.4376,7.0348,1.1641,4.3668,0.0051,1.306,0.6319,5.4062,1.7084,3.5745,0.2526,3.2603,2.5567,0.0692,2.0756,2.6019,2.0415,2.5625,0.5774,2.2262,1.757,5.6725,4.8355,4.3753,1.5794,4.1546,3.1595,4.1433,2.6023,0.0152,1.3312,4.4274,4.0604,2.7863,2.7531,1.2321,0.1823,2.2438,1.1801,1.7583,2.5726,7.407,5.4872,3.2837,4.0729,0.8501,4.4395,2.0993,2.329,0.0035,3.3442,1.9674,0.4905,3.0333,1.9849,1.6113,5.2751,1.3068,5.5704,0.7921,1.0003,3.6318,1.372,2.4893,3.6681,1.086,1.169,1.9066,2.3059,1.8181,2.8458,2.8676,4.8552,5.6086,2.9592,1.3173,0.8034,2.523,3.9524,4.2266,3.6702,1.0484,0.9095,2.4662,2.5282,3.2976,1.9969,0.0961,0.7839,1.5941,3.8074,1.8271,2.717,2.1383,5.1637,0.9964,3.0682,0.2917,2.2338,2.3481,0.0103,1.3876,1.9816,0.0004,3.1346,5.3738,1.6519,1.8608,4.6735,1.111,5.07,0.078,4.4762,1.6965,4.3586,1.86,3.0692,5.4641,1.9559,3.3313,3.3068,1.3446,5.3521,3.4662,0.9813,10.2608,5.6177,1.3729,0.0358,0.0089,0.0169,0.0248,0.0097,0.0001,0.001,0.0017,0.022,0.0024,0.0017,0.0016,0.2417,0.1002,0.0199,0.011,0.0588,0.0246,0.0808,1.7316,3.2541,2.3775,6.0681,5.1848,3.9445,0.6434,4.1548,6.5707,0.3699,1.4483,1.8171,2.7056,6.008,3.8639,2.904,2.333,5.2923,3.9123,2.7188,4.3393,1.8836,3.9237,1.8144,3.3135,4.1285,1.2882,0.0028,8.0198,4.3079,4.8731,3.4287,4.3903,2.8262,3.6225,0.4373,0.315,6.4088,4.3184,2.1318,2.3407,0.7863,0.0087,3.914,2.5339,6.7987,2.1142,0.0338,6.603,2.559,5.8963,0.6117,6.3804,5.1983,2.6146,3.6969,1.6514,0.0003,4.5604,4.9236,0.791,0.1738,5.9427,5.9061,1.9147,1.4749,5.9706,1.0627,5.8007,4.9943,6.3622,2.6667,5.1978,0.0001,3.9998,5.8091,1.411,2.8279,4.5191,2.2194,1.0763,1.1128,3.6896,1.2942,3.395,4.0464,1.4248,1.7079,0.001,0.0003,5.4834,2.0483,6.6803,2.5448,0.036,2.8528,3.1862,5.8207,3.3917,8.9014,2.6596,0.1464,8.6308,6.5764,4.2582,3.1001,3.4463,4.2083,0.0876,2.5131,0.4099,3.9598,1.1406,2.7645,1.203,0.4681,1.1429,0.0003,3.6148,6.4676,0.0043,1.027,0.2131,1.8663,3.7183,2.2264,3.504,0.7338,1.5666,0.6279,3.8567,1.6052,2.1015,0.0683,4.571,0.1868,2.4745,1.1419,1.0641,0.5788,5.2328,4.6548,4.0889,1.7839,1.7135,4.202,1.8403,1.498,0.8277,0.4798,4.0746,3.0697,4.8265,1.3128,0.9122,0.0002,3.0236,4.618,4.757,1.0654,0.5386,2.6064,2.742,0.0002,2.2474,4.5591,5.1888,4.6756,0.4502,0.7544,5.706,0.2383,5.0486,4.9151,4.5704,1.1712,0.2106,0.7136,2.6003,1.6812,0.0793,3.5027,1.3839,3.6656,4.9823,7.2313,2.407,5.7447,4.5714,2.3103,0.1126,3.8258,3.4285,4.1127,0.2354,2.3205,1.2999,1.0534,0.0006,0.0005,1.9677,1.9398,5.577,4.1298,4.1221,2.5735,2.0136,4.6514,4.8374,3.8459,1.0836,4.0922,1.4408,0.6882,6.4944,3.7742,1.3847,0.1377,0.0025,0.0005,0.0847,4.839,2.9044,0.3313,1.0577,4.3189,3.0726,2.9818,2.1819,3.9137,1.1717,2.6049,2.7172,0.8413,3.2221,1.6906,1.7459,5.185,1.866,1.8788,5.1254,2.3889,4.1114,0.3991,0.6726,0.3189,0.0002,4.0171,0.1263,2.5386,2.5098,1.8924,2.3651,4.2405,1.4748,3.1938,2.7371,1.8491,3.5105,5.7434,2.3651,2.0149,1.8147,3.6624,2.0865,2.6007,5.7776,0.7707,4.465,2.2558,3.9925,1.479,3.4259,2.6271,3.4993,3.2911,0.8375,3.866,3.0767,2.1471,2.0711,3.5903,0.0164,2.225,1.2504,1.7558,3.5212,1.4217,3.3417,0.4259,5.1017,2.5971,1.2099,0.4607,5.9485,1.916,0.5233,0.0002,5.4914,5.3156,1.747,2.4841,2.3827,0.001,3.5647,0.2511,0.6124,5.0088,4.5556,1.8373,1.994,2.4845,2.018,0.3656,0.0007,0.2191,0.0041,0.0964,0.0452,1.9179,0.377]}
{"id":627,"ended":false,"length":551,"gen_text":"The Miami Hurricanes came into the 1980 college football season after an 5 \u2013 6 season in 1979 under head coach Howard Schnellenberger. During that season, the team was nicknamed the `` Jet Pack 'N' B---- '. Miami eventually won the MAC title and became the most popular team in the country. In 1978, the Hurricanes added another head coach, Mike Riley. Riley was fired a couple of years later. In 1986, the team made its season debut without a starter after coming up short of the team's scoring total, and the team never had a true rushing attack again. Miami won three consecutive seasons in 1987-88 after being one of the biggest winners of the season. There are a ton of reasons for why the Hurricanes had such good season:... At 4-0, they were averaging over 400 yards per game... The players who were supposed to be rushing in the second half of this season seemed to be getting injured and were out for some time.... The defense had its issues, and there were a number of defensive problems... The fans got their very best shots... This squad was the most prolific in the country and the country was waiting for Riley to get out there to show what kind of quarterback he had when he got back.... The team made a run at the national championship by winning their most recent home game at the Miami Marriott on Dec. 23, 1978... The team was headed by Jerry Lewis. That's what we would call the `Wah-Wah-St. Patrick's game,' where James Brown ran over a linebacker, then passed to a quarterback at least a dozen times in practice... The game was played in front of a field of 6,000 people, and in the fourth quarter, Jim McGovern had the Bears take the lead in the 3 zone. McGovern used his pass to run over the first running back in the game. At this point, the Bears had 6 players on offense. All three of the running backs scored on the fourth down. It was one of the best moments in college football history. However, McGovern decided not to go with it until after the game to let his team lose the game... The second half was a battle between the Bears and the Dolphins, who came out on top. The contest ended with a score of 4-0 and the team scored at least 2 points in just a few minutes.... The Dolphins didn't really want to go over the top again. They decided to go with what, by the time the scoreboard went off, was this: The Bears were 5 - 1. What did McGovern think when that score would come back up for him, to take the picture? One of McGovern's two final words before the game against the Dolphins was, \"Oh my God...

According to the Chinese government, the Chinese government is seeking to create an independent independent China.\nTo see a larger version of this post visit our website: http:\/\/www.worldwarzette.com\/archives\/index\/192299\/index.html\nClick a thumbnail to enlarge.\nClick a thumbnail to enlarge.","token_len":578,"entropy":[8.6367,10.8039,3.9809,4.886,2.8114,5.8476,3.331,1.6164,7.9981,5.9545,2.7672,7.4944,8.9904,1.0424,1.4163,4.6834,6.1624,4.4627,2.9534,0.7271,2.0611,7.702,16.9511,4.8642,4.581,5.3625,7.3836,2.7134,4.6252,5.0105,1.7944,2.3189,4.2389,0.6293,7.9124,1.7211,5.9081,1.6369,8.8414,3.0979,0.2347,1.5523,11.5921,2.3621,0.3819,2.6917,3.415,4.9182,1.7528,5.8304,3.3087,0.5891,3.1625,3.8796,2.1951,0.0001,2.6258,2.1578,1.8776,1.5507,2.7224,0.8674,0.1072,0.6704,5.4651,5.9031,3.7693,0.6623,1.7419,4.2799,0.8004,2.5026,1.0354,4.7703,0.9523,2.9254,1.1793,1.0783,1.9339,1.5006,3.534,2.5328,3.3758,3.4932,0.7315,2.1419,2.9046,1.1974,2.9651,2.3648,1.8932,0.086,0.6058,0.5722,4.5182,1.2518,0.8997,1.0211,6.0161,3.4638,0.7334,0.8925,3.9678,0.0334,4.9751,5.0256,5.4347,4.2056,1.357,1.0159,0.1049,4.9233,2.2192,4.7438,3.6973,0.2961,5.3248,2.1791,6.3613,1.7559,1.5862,4.3865,3.1061,0.0015,3.3737,5.1603,1.0475,4.2721,3.0385,1.1221,5.0337,2.8832,2.2295,4.0188,3.425,5.0545,2.8448,1.5683,4.5129,4.2136,0.0629,3.3489,3.6529,5.849,4.5885,1.3385,0.5194,4.1096,1.5833,0.5811,1.5046,5.3717,0.0466,0.4275,4.7026,0.3453,5.0152,4.1436,5.9779,1.0861,4.2307,3.9944,3.3429,0.3322,3.073,1.7301,5.5236,2.0921,0.3004,4.5536,3.9165,4.7012,3.9454,0.8863,1.451,1.6304,2.0802,5.2784,0.0301,3.9498,2.724,1.1621,4.0328,3.6607,0.6946,0.2426,5.124,0.2447,0.8722,4.7414,5.4167,0.0524,0.0158,0.065,1.766,2.1592,4.7867,1.2599,0.8691,1.083,0.9961,1.4249,2.3776,3.9046,4.373,3.5553,3.2064,4.8409,1.9104,0.0009,0.5042,6.045,4.2431,2.0078,1.1836,1.3072,0.5171,2.9857,5.2208,2.8822,4.4195,0.0993,2.376,2.6438,2.7095,0.1864,4.0861,2.3334,0.2849,0.7635,1.1448,2.8171,4.1555,6.0518,0.1853,1.0997,5.8299,1.7266,0.4184,0.0076,2.9155,0.7308,0.0363,0.3603,2.7055,3.9294,0.9791,3.1539,0.3453,3.5615,2.2242,4.0448,0.788,1.8825,0.0044,0.2102,4.2709,2.8493,2.3249,0.2433,0.0732,1.1472,3.4882,0.1424,2.6642,0.2728,6.8726,2.8639,2.7147,0.8731,4.862,1.5647,2.308,0.0116,0.1664,0.3814,5.1638,1.4828,4.8585,1.5321,4.1306,1.2999,6.0066,2.9933,0.2944,3.9976,0.0103,0.4823,0.0005,2.518,0.5464,2.2556,5.6914,3.4224,5.0466,5.8246,3.1239,0.4578,1.9701,6.3529,2.9087,0.9194,2.7844,2.1473,1.2941,0.229,2.9359,0.025,1.7773,0.0017,0.3223,1.0754,2.7969,3.907,3.0189,2.1376,0.3485,3.4504,4.97,1.1132,3.0845,0.3036,5.5207,4.1246,5.1751,1.1119,3.747,0.0167,1.2188,1.9169,0.0007,1.9382,4.208,3.003,5.6388,2.5434,2.8922,0.7901,0.3659,2.1294,0.0016,1.05,2.3937,0.0235,1.8485,0.1265,0.018,2.7677,5.2497,0.2225,1.4819,14.1233,0.0192,0.289,5.4962,1.6848,3.7754,0.0015,5.4724,1.525,1.0663,0.6347,1.0293,2.9519,0.0084,1.9552,0.9935,0.0007,4.188,3.6399,3.5116,4.7615,2.3266,3.5543,0.3003,1.2877,0.9119,0.9655,0.0135,5.0798,2.8266,3.0103,3.3656,3.0366,1.9665,2.311,0.1983,0.5535,0.0125,2.1805,1.9076,0.0016,2.8743,1.6326,2.5607,0.0025,0.8699,0.0014,0.4391,0.4407,0.9573,3.6468,3.0489,0.2335,0.6846,3.1008,3.8436,0.0286,3.5463,0.2622,0.8018,4.9218,3.3311,5.2242,1.7664,2.6848,6.2352,0.7989,2.8974,2.1313,1.717,4.2804,0.8228,4.3595,3.9219,2.2277,5.5883,0.5865,0.0382,0.9954,2.5322,4.0194,0.5954,2.4883,0.2801,1.6429,2.3169,3.3855,3.0149,1.0583,4.7417,0.811,0.0464,2.9307,0.0221,1.1586,0.0103,0.8177,0.2229,0.0494,6.0474,1.9599,4.9763,0.1661,0.624,0.1682,0.0158,4.164,0.0003,2.7001,4.0377,1.7971,3.8802,4.3066,2.361,1.3706,5.5484,0.0046,0.3317,0.0129,1.4572,0.0591,0.0567,2.9824,4.4051,4.0003,4.8019,5.5938,0.5342,0.0058,2.7928,1.0477,0.5882,4.9148,5.8623,1.5284,2.0737,2.0835,4.476,1.8929,4.8811,0.3576,0.3592,4.2427,0.8399,1.7021,3.9057,0.0056,0.0494,0.0144,3.3926,5.5637,3.7202,0.3262,0.3001,4.3318,1.3493,0.132,2.6546,2.3485,6.4126,0.0019,1.3602,1.7036,2.7314,0.2085,0.9013,2.3016,2.0212,4.7221,4.8524,0.6706,3.5655,2.2474,0.4733,3.4693,2.3672,1.5485,1.0082,5.3343,4.7627,2.5348,3.3568,0.2586,0.1386,0.0894,2.7374,2.042,1.3371,2.9113,1.4572,0.867,0.0011,0.5149,0.0007,4.5957,0.5182,3.9172,3.7403,0.0384,0.4099,0.4019,3.7172,0.0519,4.4291,3.6329,3.1492,5.1465,6.1282,1.539,4.7125,0.4157,0.5302,1.0694,4.6868,4.7884,1.2783,0.3609,0.4116,1.0533,1.0603,2.3711,0.9189,0.039,0.015,0.1122,0.0322]}
{"id":4929,"ended":false,"length":544,"gen_text":"Construction of the California Southern was repeatedly interrupted by Santa Fe's rival, Southern Pacific Railroad ( SP ). In one instance, the California Southern was set to build a level junction, where its main traffic would stop. The California Southern's proposed level junction at Bolsa Mesa would have required the destruction of the existing bridge and the construction of new one in several layers.\n\nThis project required the destruction of part of the original Sacramento River Bridge, and the destruction of its entire length during construction.\n\nThe Riverside-Sugar Land Highway Project (R-SS), along with the Southern Pacific's North Mountain & Pacific Railroad (SPLR), was one thing, but this could have been worse. As a matter of fact, the project would completely destroy the historic Sacramento River, which is the southern flank of the Sacramento River, making it one of four southern choke points between California State University ( Cal State ) and its California capital, Los Angeles. Also, the proposed route would have had to traverse several sections of the California River and the Sacramento River Valley, and so on during the development period.\n\nFinally, Southern Pacific would have required the removal of the Sacramento River Bridge from its existing route. At this point, the proposed route would have required the closure of three bridges on the Sacramento River, leaving one bridge complete and the others finished.\n\nOne question still remains: what about these five reasons?\n\nAs we point out in The End of California Highway, the Sacramento River River's main arteries were constructed in two stages. They were constructed by California engineers, and after three decades of work, the Sacramento River's arteries can be described as being \"open to traffic\".\n\nAnd, just as a reminder, during the early phases of construction, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger took pains to include at least one reason behind his construction plans, a necessity that he assumed would ensure that \"everything is done right\".\n\nHe said that the Sacramento river was part of the Sacramento River Valley watershed, \"which it is our responsibility to maintain.\" In other words, it was going to be, by any chance, Sacramento.\n\nIn any event, the Sacramento River was not completed at all.\n\nOn March 23, 1981, the Sacramento River Board ( SCB ) decided to re-designate the river its own, instead of being a part of the Sacramento River watershed. The design for the river was that of a new freeway that had to cut over its length and connect with the freeway over the south-central bridge.\n\nThese new, higher-traffic highways were to provide a level crossing to Sacramento that was similar to the current Los Angeles bridge. The new freeway would connect Sacramento with Central Valley, to the north-south, and then east to Sacramento.\n\nHere's just a partial list of the final stages of the Sacramento River's construction:","token_len":579,"entropy":[3.3333,1.5493,7.4143,7.7359,9.9546,9.4292,3.8367,0.6894,9.1626,3.692,2.1971,7.813,1.5697,4.2908,1.8093,1.0339,2.3067,10.4372,7.0196,2.3818,5.4435,2.0557,0.2147,1.5724,4.3505,0.5166,2.0218,5.6821,2.0029,4.8963,0.7344,9.9073,11.1072,3.1034,4.7463,4.2634,4.0469,4.5302,2.0641,4.1243,2.3087,1.8246,3.9073,0.1295,2.537,4.4993,3.2305,1.3054,3.5089,5.4632,4.161,0.1679,2.0543,2.3623,1.5237,2.8567,2.0226,5.8926,0.0272,2.2036,3.1761,3.7836,2.4514,2.1863,2.3044,0.0266,3.0129,3.5548,4.3014,5.9841,5.1622,0.9545,1.7561,0.0405,4.3103,2.981,5.3333,1.6316,2.5077,0.0263,6.3646,0.0116,0.3186,4.9015,5.1613,2.9744,2.5566,1.3485,2.0713,1.3147,2.9038,0.0231,4.3535,4.0907,1.5819,5.6286,1.0874,0.4062,1.8407,0.0002,1.4031,5.6555,2.8594,4.2399,2.1415,0.428,3.8705,3.8119,2.4368,0.5515,0.9935,4.6545,3.6417,5.4952,0.2832,0.9465,3.4523,0.2172,2.935,6.0382,5.0053,6.3733,2.5116,1.1122,0.9819,1.0548,5.0578,1.1801,1.4745,3.8613,8.0921,1.5079,0.2656,3.6263,6.2529,1.6781,0.6285,4.8071,0.3135,3.9204,2.2599,4.057,0.0019,0.2522,0.0548,1.2497,2.6667,2.5468,6.5223,1.1603,0.646,4.9804,1.6269,0.4853,2.6313,2.3556,2.3202,1.7042,5.1967,6.1335,0.029,0.2783,1.1039,0.714,2.253,4.8049,0.3891,2.5219,0.0282,7.3836,4.4788,4.722,0.6129,3.2707,2.2075,5.8724,1.5345,1.755,5.927,0.6095,4.0671,0.521,4.7133,4.4552,3.5915,1.4082,3.1312,0.0085,0.3746,5.7398,0.4663,0.986,3.5018,3.9006,1.1038,1.1557,3.6464,0.2085,3.9718,3.8552,4.5386,0.1231,0.5536,3.3514,2.8074,3.1174,2.7516,2.1568,0.6788,3.8933,1.0611,2.8206,5.136,1.4588,6.861,1.2449,3.8809,3.4383,0.3853,0.823,0.0003,5.6236,0.041,5.3238,0.0305,2.9742,0.2951,3.2302,0.8686,2.5915,0.0419,1.393,2.5756,0.6321,1.2983,2.4481,1.4675,1.9728,4.1738,1.5668,5.006,2.2371,0.5271,0.2616,0.9395,3.233,1.1088,0.7055,0.2689,0.8882,0.6583,4.9484,0.0283,4.0158,1.9819,2.9745,0.4455,0.6463,0.1805,1.1762,4.7619,3.7198,1.0681,5.5317,1.6557,1.0654,3.7817,4.8675,0.4086,0.9572,0.0002,5.0284,5.1748,4.9074,0.7468,0.7129,2.1135,3.1471,5.2838,4.6896,5.943,1.0439,1.1184,0.0002,4.4177,2.921,5.924,0.0206,0.8067,4.6264,4.4667,0.2068,1.9122,3.2945,0.9924,1.4304,3.6199,0.3456,5.5989,4.1974,4.4967,2.6337,3.108,3.4181,1.5685,5.2628,2.6055,1.37,5.1493,0.6032,1.7831,2.8211,4.1678,4.5028,1.8007,1.4128,5.0395,5.0136,1.7065,0.5647,3.8278,0.4843,1.5077,1.9664,0.0977,3.0584,4.3564,5.7867,0.7369,3.1709,0.2078,2.0706,2.1919,5.5216,2.3934,1.7894,2.2164,1.4698,0.0002,5.642,2.3017,4.5119,1.1255,3.3434,2.6457,0.3204,4.8813,0.6406,2.7239,3.3199,0.0741,2.1829,0.5611,3.2367,5.3527,2.383,0.0002,4.8991,4.2985,0.0406,4.7977,5.7383,0.1931,0.8895,2.7834,3.4605,1.651,3.6612,3.3262,2.3693,3.5073,5.3545,1.4883,2.9172,5.5912,0.5942,5.7664,1.0706,4.1027,5.4253,2.2841,2.7352,1.6824,0.6982,0.8892,0.0002,4.8864,3.2433,1.5275,1.5895,1.3378,4.8085,1.6802,4.8146,0.0074,0.918,2.2369,0.9206,2.052,6.287,0.6729,4.1179,2.342,5.8182,1.0975,3.6806,0.6141,0.2008,3.1547,2.6452,3.0587,0.7304,0.0024,0.0646,2.6925,0.7828,6.0384,0.0261,0.506,4.8916,3.7741,3.4126,4.2243,0.063,4.5764,2.2784,0.687,0.0002,2.8509,3.9134,1.1267,0.0054,1.56,1.4835,0.0934,1.7314,2.3704,4.5659,3.9485,1.333,1.0921,1.8875,0.0002,4.6721,3.0123,3.3683,0.1527,4.1581,0.0979,1.3303,1.0895,0.4802,5.6172,2.8132,4.8679,0.2693,0.1007,3.0527,0.7318,5.2006,1.0472,2.743,1.4839,0.4736,2.8326,4.3684,1.9614,1.8127,3.903,0.2515,3.489,3.1647,1.9565,0.0052,0.5178,0.4736,0.1468,3.7211,0.3339,1.8652,5.0939,4.5336,0.4346,2.3491,0.9224,4.5215,1.1179,1.1426,3.4388,4.078,2.5995,4.5295,2.3064,5.1504,4.6129,4.6302,3.155,2.3921,3.4074,2.9555,0.6516,4.0429,4.5981,1.2585,5.2791,2.6232,1.8576,4.8872,1.5679,0.984,0.0002,5.7692,3.4159,4.961,4.904,0.6388,4.2633,0.0115,3.659,1.5927,1.5198,4.6592,1.5674,4.9498,0.5594,2.9782,4.228,3.3098,2.0125,5.3622,0.086,0.847,4.1409,4.1318,0.0057,4.3657,1.3864,1.8818,2.2019,0.6584,0.5583,3.0343,2.9292,1.094,5.6504,1.1384,1.0297,5.3234,1.0698,1.6212,1.4808,1.6161,1.2769,0.7578,3.1873,4.2014,1.1686,2.7451,1.014,0.7407,0.0002,5.7834,0.8204,5.9589,1.0393,3.6975,1.4379,0.1072,1.1136,5.8629,4.6353,0.2812,0.7084,1.5254,0.1385,1.9455,0.8149,0.8034]}
{"id":2391,"ended":true,"length":517,"gen_text":"Coming into his junior year on the 2014 \u2013 15 team, Dunham was named to the Preseason All @ - @ Big East First Team. Dunham stopped drinking Mountain Dew prior to the final game of the year in the Sugar Bowl. Dunham also helped the Huskies to four Big Ten Championship games in his rookie season. On Nov. 20, 2013, Dunham's collegiate record was 12-7 and he broke Bob Costas' career mark for longest national championship winless NCAA tournament game. He received a lifetime Achievement Award, a Class of '15 Class of '16 Class of '17, and the John Muir Award after being honored by President Obama. Following the season, Dunham posted a 40 point, 17 assist, 9 rebounds and 13 assists as the second team All 4 conference leaders in scoring, averaging 14.5 points per game and a team-high 5.8 rebounds\/assist ratio. Dunham finished the year averaging 18.3 points, 4.1 assists and a franchise-record 3.4 rebounds per game in 41 contests. After the 2014 season, Dunham returned to school during the 2015-16 season and served as head coach for the Huskies in their regular season finale. Dunham spent some time coaching college basketball last fall.\n\nDunham was chosen to serve as a member of the 2014 NCAA Championship Team after serving as the team's all-time leading scorer with 23 points and 13 rebounds in the game. At 6-8, the 6-foot-3, 230-pound Dunham's height and heavy build gave him a unique look. The two point guard had the size and physicality of an NBA point guard and will likely become a force on the 2017 team.\n\nAfter his season, Dunham received a two term postseason stint on the 2016 team. Following this, Dunham coached an expansion team in Sacramento, Calif. in the Western Conference Second Round of the NBA draft. He is the son of three All-NBA selection Josh Dunham (2011-16) and a 4th All-Freshman selection in 2011. He played center and left wing in the 2012 draft.\n\nWith his father, he has been active for over twenty years in the community supporting the community. Dunham has been the inspiration to many young men and women. This past June, during his junior year, Dunham came out and stood for my entire community with a smile and he is all about helping others by going out and doing his absolute best on the basketball court.

{"id":4511,"ended":true,"length":553,"gen_text":"The Big Inch pipeline was made from sections of seamless steel pipe up to 44 feet ( 13 m ) long, 3 \u2044 8 inch ( 9 @. @ 5 mm ) thick steel piping over one or more of the pipe walls or openings. The piping was then poured in water through a pipe opening and then transported through a large conveyor belt. The water flow was carried through a water treatment tank using gasification and methanol. The tank had a water pipe and its contents were covered by a filter that filtered and sealed the filter and pumped water through the tank. The flow were heated and the amount of water that could flow was filtered with two pumps, with one pump at the center and the other at the outside. It was also used to heat electricity to 4 A. s. per minute or more, by placing a hose on the outside and using small quantities of pressure in the center. It was also used to heat food for use in the village or to cool and cool off any cold beverages left on the house floor. The power and plumbing used to operate the project were maintained during the construction period... This type of electricity production is required for the long-term development of the village in a way that can last for decades. This type of electricity generated from this type of electrical production has the potential to serve the needs of many villages, which will not be met with the same level of generation. In addition to their potential, these types of electricity production provide an alternative to expensive traditional power plant projects which may be less expensive in time because of the more efficient power line, equipment, and facilities.\n\nThe main concern for the villagers today is providing food, clothing, fuel, shelter, protection, and heating and cooling the household items needed to continue their lives in harmony and harmony with nature. This is the responsibility of the villagers themselves in the long-term development of the village. The most important part of the family life that villagers will be aware of is the fact that the environment will not be what it was in the days before the invention of these two electric vehicles, which may have provided an alternative for urban people. However, today, the residents, through the efforts of village managers and residents associations, the villagers will be able to enjoy a more dignified daily life without wasting their time, money, and time.\n\n\"This project will lead to the creation of an economy that is for all and can be built with maximum efficiency.\"...\n\nThe National Rural Income Credit Fund (NRIF) aims to raise about $30,000 annually to help the villages to meet their basic needs to provide for themselves and their families.\n\nThe projects outlined on this website are based on actual, real-life situations and have not been evaluated by the Food and Agriculture Organization.

The Storm 3 also features the unique front plate front-pneumatic shock drum for better stability and increased shock response. Additionally, the Storm 3 has a new hard coating on the brake seat with an advanced material that is more durable than similar parts used for its brake levers during service. The Storm 3's low fuel tank, higher volume exhaust system allows it to generate more power during operation, so it gets the best performance out of the suspension. Also, while in service, the suspension is adjustable so that the Storm 3's front tire can rotate up to 50 degrees for a full lap.\n\n, designed for protection against light weapon threats, utilizes the unique technology, which will reduce the energy requirements of the engine system, and the exhaust system, which is similar to the internal combustion engine system. The Storm 3's front tires will always be rated for maximum traction. They also provide the highest performance, highest fuel economy that can even handle large roads like mountain roads. By making these vehicles less prone to fuel exhaustion, you get the latest and best performance by taking the right decisions on fuel and weight.\n\nNote: Due to its size, a Storm 3 is not compatible with all cars that have a different power delivery system (as shown in the following image from below).

On paper, we would think those purchases would make a big difference, but the current owners have been willing to take big amounts of money out of the club's management by signing for a player who has been good for over ten years.\n\nArsenal are one of the best bargains on offer in the Premier League and have seen some exciting signings during that time period, but Arsenal have had some difficulties in getting their new signings included in their transfer deals.\n\nWith the latest and greatest in terms of players, Liverpool's salary cap is set to increase to \u00a350m over the next four seasons, with the next two years, \u00a325m, the \u00a39m for this summer's transfer deadline of March 31st.\n\nThe Reds will need to pay around \u00a310m more, to reach our goal of bringing in around \u00a37m this season, for a reduction to \u00a37m from last season's \u00a33.3m.","token_len":582,"entropy":[6.0916,1.568,5.1131,1.3837,9.0819,0.0111,1.9538,4.4868,0.125,2.8956,1.2677,3.4641,17.3503,9.9298,4.1967,9.4125,1.6723,5.6346,6.3863,3.6283,6.6835,2.3426,3.3183,1.7958,5.2161,16.5719,10.7247,5.3015,2.6755,9.1511,5.4279,3.4733,2.5262,1.711,2.3816,1.0704,6.1705,5.3263,0.764,2.3604,4.6598,2.7212,1.7294,0.8225,3.5202,1.3202,0.0568,2.8849,1.2642,5.5251,0.0045,3.0469,3.0987,3.4548,0.8039,1.5138,0.0198,2.5612,1.0713,1.7783,2.5194,5.0359,5.1943,3.3571,1.618,4.2564,2.9906,2.8568,1.7505,3.2932,3.4313,2.0686,1.129,3.5871,3.0138,3.4045,2.4051,4.7775,2.973,1.0967,0.2878,0.0002,2.8298,3.3741,4.4838,3.0115,3.3651,0.183,0.0176,1.2731,5.0746,0.0498,0.0775,1.4011,0.0322,0.68,3.5924,0.0031,0.126,0.1946,0.002,0.4779,1.0282,0.003,0.0722,0.1283,0.0018,0.4865,2.0232,0.0084,1.8346,1.9532,6.6257,0.3035,0.4648,1.4613,7.3391,3.5991,0.0773,0.8626,6.2851,0.6467,2.9718,0.1939,0.638,0.451,0.8426,6.5049,4.2686,2.6464,2.8206,3.9782,1.3584,3.3573,0.0887,0.4305,0.1008,8.6992,0.8166,0.0063,0.1897,0.1493,0.0739,0.4183,0.0067,0.0675,0.2056,0.0729,0.2366,0.0063,0.0383,0.2504,0.0623,2.9212,0.009,0.4186,0.741,0.0899,0.7012,0.0044,0.5838,3.8927,1.5542,0.0286,0.1945,2.6623,0.3369,5.395,0.8005,0.0476,0.6426,0.0022,3.3993,0.2388,0.0665,0.3252,0.0014,1.7066,0.0527,0.0134,2.7296,0.0026,0.3024,4.8059,0.164,1.0697,0.0029,0.2243,0.1902,0.008,0.193,0.0875,3.1176,0.7373,4.4055,3.3711,0.1467,0.0259,4.6577,0.0252,2.2312,3.4421,0.0781,0.0809,1.0404,0.0876,0.022,0.4035,0.1323,0.0277,4.2034,5.3171,0.0002,2.1806,4.9841,3.2738,5.5055,0.2495,2.6574,1.7278,0.2772,0.0001,4.9906,2.2433,0.6634,0.0003,5.1257,1.7718,4.5024,1.2903,4.7287,4.0613,1.3801,1.02,4.4822,6.7352,1.3075,0.7959,2.9901,0.3211,0.1047,2.0313,0.8367,0.1225,2.7853,0.2408,0.0903,4.0918,5.804,0.7259,2.9579,1.783,3.1942,6.0336,4.3569,5.3116,2.7225,4.308,0.7083,1.0822,0.0002,4.453,3.1967,4.8949,4.8662,1.9143,1.523,0.7656,0.6801,4.4324,5.6217,2.7531,4.2943,3.717,4.9452,4.4016,0.232,2.922,5.2102,4.2803,5.4172,2.4258,4.5405,0.2521,0.7837,2.4808,3.0293,0.2831,1.5039,3.9104,1.5438,0.5475,3.9451,1.46,1.7871,1.8908,5.4168,2.6775,1.0443,0.0002,3.0039,1.3645,0.9646,2.9839,6.1233,0.085,0.0688,0.2561,0.0683,2.9206,4.7613,3.5696,3.5361,2.6767,0.4194,2.2792,2.4312,2.5513,1.8073,2.1033,4.8864,2.1854,5.3302,2.323,1.5305,3.5392,0.3767,2.2877,1.2444,3.8083,1.9744,0.0857,3.3799,5.1355,2.9562,2.9788,4.4602,4.0441,1.0511,5.352,0.792,0.7032,0.3745,0.0002,1.1669,2.1554,4.0828,4.0656,3.8517,3.898,3.3744,1.6829,1.691,1.1542,1.6488,5.6556,5.7718,3.5133,3.1501,1.3263,2.7043,0.3276,0.7358,3.5779,0.369,0.3242,0.8413,2.9031,2.7741,3.863,1.8908,4.0163,0.8903,3.5999,3.7861,1.0221,2.038,1.8576,0.017,0.3597,2.7471,3.5321,2.462,1.5237,3.7822,3.5459,0.6596,3.1634,0.1336,0.6469,5.7824,4.1578,0.245,5.3315,2.0551,2.8997,6.4846,5.8872,0.6971,2.7201,2.1984,1.7799,0.0839,1.551,0.4025,2.4863,4.925,2.9527,1.6445,2.5724,4.6937,0.0563,3.786,4.4509,5.3851,0.2027,0.1796,2.0436,0.0384,0.9832,0.6298,3.298,5.9064,5.3449,2.768,5.8327,2.3975,2.2734,1.9672,1.8967,1.9704,5.6669,1.1787,5.5685,4.7949,0.1002,0.7929,0.6636,0.0002,2.2566,1.7008,4.9392,0.0545,0.4321,2.3682,5.2111,0.0015,2.6304,2.003,1.3197,0.5232,0.7589,0.0025,2.6732,2.1341,5.2374,3.3842,5.5574,1.1624,4.1666,3.1201,0.2917,4.0735,1.7119,1.8999,4.1671,1.5305,2.9169,2.3213,5.2458,2.0557,2.3952,2.1133,4.6965,1.9726,5.2192,0.8719,1.4367,2.3747,3.8664,0.4773,1.2919,0.0002,5.1235,1.3885,5.2656,5.9697,0.2622,3.3629,2.5212,0.0009,3.61,1.4255,3.7049,2.5435,4.8609,0.7153,0.8997,3.2065,0.5945,2.4061,1.7104,0.2469,3.5631,0.3268,3.8276,0.293,0.1834,2.6953,1.3996,0.9619,1.9776,1.2685,4.3039,2.6531,1.5509,4.2552,2.2149,2.6084,0.1426,1.7256,3.8542,1.665,4.4504,0.3627,4.9779,5.2329,2.511,1.2624,0.8474,5.3329,4.2886,3.4255,1.8957,0.4092,1.0665,1.0344,0.0002,2.0615,4.3841,2.0075,2.7238,0.4389,3.0659,2.2054,0.0801,2.9586,0.2095,2.8654,4.1899,3.6793,3.9141,6.086,2.8771,0.2665,4.4475,0.4182,2.1708,0.4546,4.5039,0.2748,2.7419,1.1234,0.9704,3.2764,1.489,5.8734,2.7553,0.5569,2.9988,0.5117,2.9816,1.8743,0.385,1.1417,0.9551,3.2523,0.8625,2.9883,0.0328,0.7643]}
{"id":822,"ended":true,"length":558,"gen_text":"At the time of the discovery of the body, Gordon and his third wife, Jenny, were on a cycling holiday in France. They heard news of the discovery of the body and had some fun in the library. The next day, David and Jenny went to bed because of the heat. Gordon and Jenny also spent Christmas with their baby, Mary, in their home.\nAfter eating the baby's food, they went to make bread and saw that her parents were coming and go. They also talked about the discovery and the good he had done for Gordon. However, it didn't matter that the new body had taken place just a few days before their wedding. The body of the corpse belonged to one Mr. Henry Gordon.\u00a0\nGordon and Jenny would be buried the next morning. Mr. Henry Gordon died last April 6, 1974, after a battle with cancer. At funeral he said, \"I was told that my heart can beat but I can't move it and that I can't speak. It's never there. I can't move it, but I have to give it the respect that it deserved and make it live.\"\u00a0\nIt wasn't long before the church was rocked as some members of the church began to question the Lord's faith when they learned of Gordon's passing. Gordon asked for help through the church's website: www.cunninghill.org. He had lived through five seasons of \"unwanted loss\" without any loss and at no time had lost touch with Jesus Christ. He spent a year in an Eastern Roman convent then as a teenager and after three years of missionary work, he found a church-run parish he called \"The Red Cross\".\nAfter his death, Gordon and his family would attend Mass on New Year's Day. It was also Gordon's time at the Red Cross, which held their Christmas Day ceremony on Christmas Day.\nAccording to legend, the Red Devil gave Gordon's body away to Francis of Assisi for personal use by the priest of the church during their time there. He told his son he was trying to kill Gordon's sister by taking out a knife. Gordon did this when Francis had taken care of his body. It's believed that the Knife made contact with the remains of Gordon's dead body during this time.\nFrancis later died of cancer.\nGordon said he had found Jesus Christ in one of the first Christian tombs at Bethany in Pennsylvania, where the bones had been placed over a table and a glass of whiskey over a fire. Gordon went there to pray with God, and he gave help to a new man for this burial.\nSince that time, Gordon and his family have been living on Christian charity charities and are receiving more donations to help with its causes. The only time that they have ever kept all of these bodies together is during the final stages of Jesus' ministry in Israel.","token_len":582,"entropy":[2.5476,1.934,0.979,1.5467,5.284,1.645,0.6547,5.01,0.4753,8.8532,2.62,1.422,8.6681,0.3725,0.9725,6.0073,0.5817,0.9597,4.0407,1.9285,9.3464,2.3276,0.6851,3.5222,0.9103,2.0472,6.272,4.6416,0.4273,0.6957,1.1011,1.5173,0.8224,0.687,1.9144,3.9811,4.9687,1.919,3.4924,0.7384,5.2824,0.8243,2.9271,2.0879,0.4994,0.6581,6.4757,1.5657,0.6863,2.1034,0.5068,5.2638,6.0192,2.1783,0.7884,5.4795,0.8099,2.7911,2.1068,0.1325,5.2864,4.0836,3.3465,1.3268,0.8861,4.9466,2.4066,5.9432,1.0875,2.2783,2.7294,1.6118,1.3234,1.1366,8.8476,6.0296,2.2978,2.6104,1.9122,2.6091,0.3052,1.5568,1.3546,0.4623,5.7925,5.7339,1.6354,5.1784,2.0918,5.3528,4.1548,0.7908,5.4482,4.2384,5.2381,0.566,1.2779,3.7325,5.177,0.6148,1.2043,3.0684,2.4456,2.0872,6.0056,6.2095,1.4628,0.5165,1.0766,3.0611,0.837,4.8651,0.0516,2.9176,3.1714,0.0006,3.4812,1.82,1.9421,6.2732,2.0782,1.975,5.6337,3.0857,3.5077,1.1478,0.6084,0.8008,1.2958,3.6231,1.3703,0.5926,2.252,2.7794,4.0534,1.4349,5.4944,5.3543,0.0327,3.7258,6.2651,0.655,4.9948,3.3695,1.2926,6.7179,0.5813,1.8444,1.3525,0.2026,5.6415,2.8566,3.0687,5.1064,1.0704,1.9968,1.158,5.288,0.0063,0.4924,0.4916,2.7149,4.883,4.0073,3.7084,0.5593,4.4968,1.6274,3.4403,1.3474,3.4467,0.136,0.7757,0.5019,4.8254,7.3928,2.459,2.5309,1.3385,0.2202,0.9261,3.1445,4.4416,1.3406,2.1025,4.3856,6.2911,3.5507,4.517,1.0753,2.3137,0.1125,3.9819,2.0006,3.3256,2.3511,1.3768,2.0714,0.1635,3.7516,1.2017,2.6058,1.25,5.936,5.7416,0.9622,0.9192,2.1713,0.2419,2.4165,0.439,2.1503,2.3736,0.6177,4.0889,1.277,4.8137,0.3904,4.1394,4.6628,1.4845,0.9101,3.3933,2.5348,5.248,0.5419,4.952,1.4904,2.346,0.2971,4.4322,3.082,0.0014,1.9907,0.375,1.4462,5.1078,2.4306,4.5945,4.2656,5.0356,1.987,0.9076,0.2136,1.1045,3.0623,0.7447,2.3805,1.1013,4.6712,0.6781,2.303,5.1939,1.1302,2.9932,1.4262,1.5855,0.1018,3.5832,0.1586,3.7851,6.3184,2.4007,2.3063,5.3553,0.8513,1.3971,2.6654,2.2085,3.8985,3.0275,0.0018,4.0441,4.2273,5.4316,1.3895,0.4767,1.5331,2.3215,2.613,4.9499,3.5976,6.0974,5.9008,0.5287,5.2818,5.3607,3.7099,0.8206,5.1241,0.6126,6.5366,2.1451,3.3762,3.4908,5.0923,4.4495,0.6683,0.9568,4.7349,5.9794,0.0909,3.0522,0.7955,0.2289,1.9881,5.5643,3.0329,1.8315,1.3253,3.7353,5.6815,4.8951,2.8145,5.8346,5.5456,0.3859,3.376,2.5394,4.1567,4.6067,0.411,1.7279,3.6718,0.246,1.6461,1.2552,3.2807,1.8559,2.773,5.6981,2.4257,5.1982,5.8327,1.7919,1.4874,2.0006,5.0727,3.0452,1.8157,1.8921,3.2903,2.6267,2.2484,0.5258,0.7914,2.5314,1.3686,1.9444,3.8221,4.7029,3.8867,2.9459,4.6337,0.1598,0.0104,0.5285,1.5436,3.2233,0.347,3.8564,3.2003,0.2689,4.7477,3.3405,0.8625,1.3042,0.0123,2.4775,2.383,5.1908,5.1185,4.7748,3.2121,4.6958,2.1975,3.1117,0.5566,0.9017,2.1111,5.8363,0.0041,5.481,0.1454,1.9425,1.3836,9.5506,4.6622,0.4914,3.8754,0.4169,3.5715,0.7704,6.0732,2.8319,0.0523,0.002,2.5319,5.5957,0.2688,4.3733,1.9405,5.1235,2.0598,1.1362,2.7706,4.8575,2.4972,2.454,2.6263,0.1566,3.3073,4.1012,3.1611,3.1725,4.5225,1.7651,4.8688,0.0273,3.0006,1.6785,2.3129,3.9398,4.449,3.4718,3.9094,1.3917,2.0649,1.7737,2.368,4.6102,1.363,5.1111,1.3601,3.8389,4.9958,4.5311,0.0449,1.2006,4.9027,1.0733,3.3864,3.0149,1.5503,0.7098,1.7797,6.3761,5.2501,3.7516,0.0726,1.0228,5.5005,0.2105,1.3441,0.418,4.5695,1.6771,3.7291,1.3997,0.6232,0.6289,1.014,5.1135,0.0028,3.3735,3.4527,1.1547,1.5402,1.7764,1.4059,1.3441,5.072,1.6879,2.2758,4.6854,4.0014,0.6177,1.7357,4.9436,0.1635,0.5724,5.6818,5.1211,5.1243,0.0,3.3346,5.9215,0.332,2.1511,3.4043,2.2172,2.0695,2.3028,4.6592,3.1198,0.1753,2.7997,5.5034,1.3616,4.8806,2.2282,3.4628,4.3881,1.6998,5.1085,6.5938,0.9407,0.7226,0.4398,2.9695,4.6204,1.8126,1.0321,2.9622,2.8187,3.9955,2.2244,1.6599,2.2936,4.8433,6.2034,0.4053,2.738,5.4134,2.9302,5.5434,4.789,4.4212,0.2889,1.3026,5.8977,3.2205,0.2342,0.2607,0.9407,1.7253,0.3034,0.7336,0.2325,1.1854,3.2577,3.5118,6.5113,4.2492,5.4066,2.181,3.6601,4.6168,4.4438,1.7707,2.6462,0.6985,2.1136,5.7003,4.9259,0.2609,2.7457,4.6357,3.221,2.4205,1.5405,0.9347,2.1926,5.9077,5.7981,0.7172,3.6443,5.2157,3.8338,0.8194,2.3199,1.3171,3.9124,4.5209,0.0156,4.9778,0.3145,2.1809,2.1679,5.035,0.6561]}
{"id":2635,"ended":true,"length":554,"gen_text":"The first organization dedicated to advancement of athletic opportunities for people with a disability was the International Sports Organization for the Disabled ( ISOD ), founded in 1964. The founders of this organization, the IOS, are the largest organization of people with autism and other intellectual disability in the world. In 2003 Dr. Koon et al. published article 'Anthropometric Association of All Individuals With Autism and Asperger's'in the Journal of Neuropsychiatry. Now IOS is the only organization dedicated to providing information on the various physical and mental disabilities of individuals with disabilities. The IOS is the foundation for all the major public health organizations with the largest number of members. To this day, IOS remains one of the leading body of study groups, with an impressive number of published papers published on disability, disability causes, health and disability medicine. Despite considerable effort to develop research and research facilities, some research has been inconclusive, and it remains to be seen what results and how long these will lead to, and there is no definitive answer about the causes, etiology, or cure of the physical or mental disabilities in adults. IOS has received funding from NIH and the State of Illinois for its research and training, and from the National Institutes of Health. But until there is a clear understanding of why the IOS exists, the public health community needs to be able to share information and provide important information on the various illnesses and diseases that we identify in the human body and provide health information to those who are able to participate at a critical stage in their lives. The public health community is the sole community that can provide an unbiased source of information. Therefore, we must ask ourselves: Who is at risk if we give up information about the problems that people with disabilities continue to face in our communities and are being denied access at the polls? The answer lies in the lack of information that IOS has provided on this critical national issue. Since its inception in 1973, we have provided free, unmediated, free information to the public during our time as the organization. In many cases, it was free, accessible, and free for citizens of the United States. If we want to improve public health, we must have information on the causes, symptoms, and treatments that have been addressed with IOS. People with disabilities, especially people with developmental disabilities, often require information from a variety of sources including psychiatrists, family doctors, lawyers, and the medical establishment, which has often been lacking to help them to better understand their symptoms and to take proper care of themselves. To these ends I, my wife, my sons, daughter, and myself are currently living in Pennsylvania and New York.

{"id":964,"ended":false,"length":511,"gen_text":"Federer struggled with back injuries sustained in March and again in July and saw his ranking drop from No. 2 to No. 6. The 2013 season was the first since 1999 in which the No. 1 seed fell to No. 3.\n\nBut there was none more remarkable in the second half for Djourou and his French team-mates than in their first encounter with the big German. The Frenchman took part in the first half opener during which he won his first game. He put a shot up in the net on 20 minutes and came close enough for Jhon-Lamouche to pick up his first penalty. The play continued with Jacques Martin scoring three goals and the French forward finishing with nine on the night. Djourou hit a wide-open shot on 9:46 of the second half off a passing cross from the former No. 14 Djourou and he sent the ball high over the bar. But Djourou found the net, scoring and setting up the winner. As part of his international duty Djourou has taken part in World Cup qualifiers against Colombia and Costa Rica.\n\nThe final match came down in Germany against Switzerland and when the ball reached German goalkeeper Carl Jung was a little too close. Jung fired towards the net but Djourou blocked it. The France defender didn't touch the ball, however, which was enough for Germany to take a 2-1 lead. However, France goalkeeper Marco Reus was sent off and Jhon-Lamouche's shot went into the net. Djourou could never get out of the penalty area after that and even now Djourou thinks it was due to he-goes. \"It is not because my balls went out. The ball is right on me. When I am in this I should have been at my opponent's crossbar and at the right angle but I didn't have that chance,\" he told FNC.\n\n\"If I didn't play well for myself maybe I will not be playing. The goal was close but then I went over with the net, it took some good saves.\"\n\nJhon-Lamouche had taken part in training sessions on Thursday night.\n\nOn Sunday at the World Cup the 19 year old did not disappoint with his impressive performance as part of his team-mate's 100th international day.

{"id":2974,"ended":false,"length":533,"gen_text":"In 1997, DM & E announced plans to expand into the Powder River Basin ( PRB ) in Wyoming and start providing unit coal train service from that area. The railroad filed an application with the Wyoming Department of Transportation seeking to construct and operate a new line to supplement the existing line. In 2003, the Wyoming State Department of Transportation designated the Powder River Basin as a protected Wilderness Area. When the railroad received an order that it would make changes to the existing line before December 1, 2006 the railroad had to go through an extensive review process, and at one stage submitted a request for a permit. In the end, the approval process was denied. On January 4, 2007, the Wyoming Department of Transportation submitted a Request for a Forest Service Plan to complete the work with the BLM. The state's Natural Resources and Conservation Services (NNSS) determined that the line would be a reasonable and appropriate substitute for the current line.\n\nThis project can be considered to be a significant part of the development of the Powder River Basin, and there are a number of benefits to be offered based on its location during the development period. Currently, there are 2,000 km of existing lines and 2,800 km of new lines already in operation by the end of the decade.\n\nIn 2005, the Wyoming Department of Transportation finalized the Phase 1 of the pipeline, which was to be built from the Powder River Basin into northern Montana. In December 2004, the State Department of Transportation issued an order permitting the project to begin construction on July 1. By February of 2005, most of the existing lines as they had been built had been completely removed, with the last two remaining at least 5 km behind capacity.\n\nThis project will bring significant, long-term economic benefits to the Wyoming County, and in 2007, the state of Wyoming announced plans to expand into the Powder River Basin. The Wyoming State Department of Transportation approved a proposal to begin construction in 1997, but that plan was approved by the Board of Commissioners in March 2001. In 2007, the Board of Commissioners adopted an order permitting the company to begin construction of the line.\n\nThe final phase of the Powder River Basin pipeline construction includes, among others:\n\nConstruction of a 2,000-kilometre underground railroad link\n\nThe proposed route will run between the existing Line 1 and Line 5 of the Trans-Montana pipeline and continue from Koshimba to the present point of operation.\n\nConstruction of additional 20,600 m of high-voltage line over the course of the project.\n\nOther public, safety and environmental benefits include:\n\nA new, protected park that will provide natural habitat.\n\nA new community that will have a new economy of its own\n\nIncreased access to the Powder River Basin for salmon and other wildlife.\n\nImprovements to the existing infrastructure that will reduce environmental impact, including:","token_len":583,"entropy":[9.5749,0.2224,10.5801,6.5016,4.5939,9.8941,3.8764,0.1218,3.2579,3.4347,1.5156,9.1863,0.5656,1.323,4.2089,12.8496,2.5711,0.8665,2.4157,4.1433,1.7789,5.6893,5.7242,10.9651,6.1487,7.6228,0.6337,2.795,5.8174,1.8231,1.0759,1.9473,5.906,8.6408,3.325,1.0555,0.9212,0.1218,2.4275,0.6733,0.0018,1.0796,3.6542,1.4873,4.4275,3.2557,0.5609,0.7327,2.303,2.6666,2.5251,5.3737,0.5495,0.409,1.5455,1.2408,2.5027,3.9134,0.0913,1.0181,2.1288,3.6903,1.4895,0.0304,0.2694,4.8159,0.6865,1.5621,0.0092,0.1912,0.8946,0.6676,5.1979,3.9823,0.8298,1.2061,6.1366,0.8083,4.6558,4.1653,3.0201,2.9844,4.195,1.1936,1.4582,5.4822,3.9436,0.1658,0.6684,1.8379,0.8383,6.3198,4.6656,2.225,0.0599,3.5221,4.7307,3.1899,3.7289,0.9022,3.9718,0.2144,2.3344,1.5743,1.1238,1.2494,2.7829,2.4276,4.7325,2.7184,3.9949,4.3186,0.9051,2.4459,0.671,1.1938,1.3667,1.5617,2.1398,3.033,1.3789,0.3151,0.5593,5.3294,1.9159,0.3254,3.3864,1.1312,4.3684,2.1246,3.5023,0.0177,0.7339,0.2319,0.5717,1.4064,0.6302,0.0043,0.0793,4.7908,0.765,3.9706,0.0861,1.9307,4.8788,1.1741,3.5669,1.435,4.4582,0.7318,3.6985,5.3563,0.6505,3.6503,0.8432,1.0749,6.0626,2.6319,4.8714,0.0613,1.6984,1.6581,5.4982,2.549,4.7123,2.7303,0.0518,4.5323,0.2589,0.4377,2.5995,1.0903,1.3712,2.1801,5.7586,1.2854,2.6605,3.9319,0.1276,0.4955,3.0379,0.4369,1.1194,2.4009,0.0022,4.8905,2.8838,6.5267,0.3491,2.572,2.5706,0.17,1.1045,3.5066,3.8508,0.0065,0.3879,3.9967,0.2944,0.3323,1.0539,0.0105,0.0466,2.0763,1.3837,4.2888,1.0551,2.8344,0.2833,0.0068,3.9924,0.9989,2.3932,5.4545,6.6518,0.1202,2.5136,2.3682,6.913,0.6467,1.9814,2.522,0.249,6.774,0.2332,2.4996,0.3438,4.1773,0.9406,2.5357,4.9856,0.4607,2.8807,3.4576,2.872,2.5788,0.0565,3.3431,0.1183,0.0368,1.7586,0.9944,5.831,0.9993,0.9052,4.6585,0.9043,0.9213,0.0036,1.3691,2.3726,0.2941,2.7859,0.0003,3.0152,4.278,0.2104,0.7718,2.8992,0.5299,0.0023,0.0608,4.7203,1.2498,4.3794,1.8895,1.2072,0.6601,4.5372,2.4933,1.155,2.8164,1.7756,1.893,2.1812,1.977,0.9546,1.7974,0.0122,0.378,3.1302,6.1918,2.4495,0.5787,2.6367,4.2793,3.2115,0.1508,0.5504,3.791,1.2462,0.2713,0.2422,2.3735,1.988,1.6872,2.1776,0.6445,2.0801,0.4337,1.3173,0.6344,2.4255,3.3,0.8087,4.2175,4.3442,3.7693,2.827,0.6028,0.1293,5.8135,0.3678,0.067,1.1655,0.943,7.1409,3.564,4.2272,0.2957,1.6093,0.9992,0.2878,4.2855,3.1264,2.0985,2.8773,1.2591,3.9418,4.6147,1.8082,4.6096,2.6193,3.4208,1.4144,4.0399,4.1583,0.2919,1.4273,0.0002,3.9144,1.0793,2.2723,4.421,4.0307,5.1082,2.032,0.1735,0.1707,1.4589,0.6045,0.6026,0.4457,3.8512,5.81,2.2041,1.8095,4.2372,6.1159,0.5603,0.8448,2.4983,2.0967,0.0372,2.328,1.8022,0.1279,1.0909,0.4338,0.0592,0.0637,0.0036,0.0136,1.8293,0.9925,2.9767,0.5274,0.0363,0.0013,0.0052,2.1915,1.8478,3.3962,0.8957,3.1645,0.1911,2.4019,5.7254,1.3799,2.8637,4.6233,1.6531,0.6504,4.3992,1.1353,0.3449,3.9037,0.0952,2.1675,1.4774,3.4405,4.6437,0.3933,1.6867,3.3562,0.0788,0.4724,2.258,0.4346,0.0117,3.93,2.2732,1.6355,2.0546,0.5574,5.1432,0.2197,0.5517,0.2737,2.4703,0.4503,0.9114,1.2753,1.3649,0.0002,1.6471,5.8022,2.399,0.2025,0.2155,3.1101,0.0025,0.0266,2.3493,4.5509,4.1484,5.2847,1.3181,2.2255,1.6331,0.3723,0.0002,1.7262,0.1932,1.2653,4.2179,0.7663,1.5753,0.8554,1.2377,1.387,0.0066,4.6585,4.1549,4.0902,3.4246,0.0001,3.4998,6.2292,3.1548,1.6196,2.5707,2.8807,1.5635,5.196,2.4722,1.4083,0.7931,1.2407,3.705,1.7743,0.1515,5.2696,0.3981,4.061,0.1393,4.8316,2.7487,5.3949,2.4482,6.095,4.126,2.7742,5.0042,1.2029,1.3856,4.9696,2.7275,1.4038,2.419,1.2782,0.7989,0.0001,0.9975,0.1588,4.6422,5.125,1.302,5.974,4.1395,2.1702,4.9127,0.2499,2.855,0.0005,2.6492,4.8848,0.9001,4.636,0.001,0.891,0.5485,2.3247,0.2514,0.0001,6.2283,5.1832,3.89,5.0761,0.5591,0.5338,1.1582,1.8729,1.0387,0.1394,0.0001,2.9877,2.5685,2.8506,5.1817,5.4374,3.1298,0.5496,1.9094,3.9087,1.6053,5.0381,0.2203,0.0001,1.3918,1.2404,4.5941,2.286,0.2381,2.4967,1.5347,3.0181,5.0387,4.2896,0.4711,0.0011,2.6882,0.0002,3.969,2.789,0.2044,2.2234,2.0253,0.0077,0.2504,1.6249,5.9623,0.9923,1.2157,0.6225,0.6888,0.0618,0.0001,4.2233,1.011,0.3521,1.1771,1.8649,3.3507,2.3194,1.2119,3.6117,3.174,1.6243,2.8716,1.5194,1.7875]}
{"id":4763,"ended":true,"length":548,"gen_text":"Symbolism is used very heavily in Blue Velvet. The most consistent symbolism in the film is an insect motif introduced at the end of the first scene, when the camera zooms in on the flower and says that it is \"a dragon or insect motif\":\n\nBut what's so special about this insect motif is that it never gets tired of seeing the bee in the next scene:\n\nThese particular images are used as symbols for both the bird and dragon motifs:\n\n\" The dragon or dragon motif in the first scene\n\nWhen this monster shows up again and it actually has a dragon or butterfly motif, you have to go into the butterfly motif to see who it's feeding on. It's very common on Blue Velvet where we've seen a dragon or butterfly before, and we've seen one or two later on. As a concept, I can see a dragon or butterfly being really effective for this sort of thing.\" \" A dragon or butterfly in some sort of a new context? \"\n\nI can never imagine someone using a bird motif to show a dragon or butterfly.\n\nAt the very end of the movie, the butterfly motif was also introduced and the song was repeated from the perspective of the dragon or butterfly:\n\nThe dragon motif was used to show the butterfly butterfly (which the butterfly might even be wearing in the song, which probably makes it into the second image).\n\nFinally...\n\nThat's just an incredible idea. I couldn't think of a better way to approach the butterfly motif in a film that was so often used by Disney. As always, you just have to check out this one for yourself.\n\n\n-Linda\n\nThis image from \"Magic Girl\" is a visual representation of the butterfly butterfly on the top of a butterfly. I won't include any information about the colors of the butterflies, but what appears in the movie is a \"dragon,\" which may or may not be a dragon. The butterfly butterfly on the top of a butterfly is a \"white butterfly,\" whose color is almost entirely comprised of yellow.\n\nThis animation of the butterfly is also a \"motorcycle,\" where a car, carousel or other motor vehicle moves through a blue field, where it uses several motor vehicles. This isn't what you see in the original movie, but it's possible that this was a very clever clever idea by animator Dave Henson for a cartoon movie that has a real \"dragon's\" flying over its head and spinning through the air over and over again. As a side note, this animation does actually show that some of the colors of dragon are actually purple.\n\nIf you are seeing a picture of a dragon that would really be a dragon, I'd encourage you to see the movie before purchasing a copy. We should all enjoy these awesome pictures.\n\n-Amy\n\nClick to expand...","token_len":584,"entropy":[9.2208,3.3936,2.6914,4.4733,6.6202,4.4441,0.7755,9.9888,4.375,1.7148,2.251,4.4698,6.43,5.0708,2.0486,1.1678,3.069,0.3227,4.1817,7.4293,4.1761,7.5229,3.8311,0.2519,0.766,0.404,0.4552,3.1171,1.676,1.5288,3.7948,2.0458,4.686,2.1177,0.0001,0.6128,0.516,1.2267,5.8102,2.3795,4.4133,3.7775,1.4844,1.0347,2.2641,2.7,5.6421,5.1197,4.2817,4.9124,6.2976,0.6489,0.0666,4.751,3.0433,2.5759,3.2611,1.7902,0.0621,0.9351,2.7962,0.4418,1.7886,0.4539,0.4401,4.9739,3.1273,4.6655,0.7529,4.3941,1.7503,5.8987,2.8029,0.7696,5.0955,0.2617,3.2394,0.2731,0.0005,5.9021,5.8665,2.9696,1.242,3.9218,2.5729,4.7769,1.6808,4.5561,1.1556,5.6136,0.4702,3.3681,0.8407,0.5543,2.6163,0.2007,0.0003,4.7021,6.3809,2.4941,3.2019,1.7384,0.3702,3.3072,1.2778,1.4712,0.3212,4.6701,0.0003,4.4086,4.5115,6.4261,4.1325,0.3515,4.2258,3.1649,3.7928,5.9868,3.5559,1.3047,2.5036,2.5198,4.1436,1.5206,1.2241,3.0548,3.2243,0.8297,3.9825,3.2163,1.0788,5.6342,1.3421,1.4986,0.9619,4.8123,0.9918,2.2747,5.2057,0.4651,0.7186,2.4994,0.456,2.5771,3.712,4.2094,2.6641,0.0038,3.2322,3.4243,3.3782,0.4855,2.2937,1.3794,1.1178,0.4303,4.4578,1.1623,1.5067,2.8675,1.1179,0.5657,3.1538,3.3618,0.1602,6.0084,2.2423,1.9175,5.4582,1.9798,5.7046,0.4958,2.459,3.9095,1.3803,3.3051,0.9095,0.7218,0.1366,2.9065,5.4566,5.3002,3.2235,1.8787,4.6647,0.0005,1.9691,2.1634,3.4953,4.8003,1.2873,0.0905,0.0275,2.286,5.8301,3.1994,0.0394,2.7939,5.3312,4.2604,3.9518,1.655,0.6577,0.0003,3.6279,3.0386,6.1589,3.2467,5.2375,2.4649,1.7796,3.4772,1.3311,1.5854,3.4447,2.4461,0.9724,0.3618,0.1516,1.8617,2.106,0.0002,5.825,0.765,2.3659,1.0136,0.2665,0.2468,2.4026,0.3605,1.5753,2.3271,0.654,4.9537,3.9568,2.5922,3.6174,2.9099,4.9524,2.9422,3.1575,4.8565,0.7614,5.8133,0.0149,0.7404,1.9549,1.2505,0.1299,1.5199,0.0703,0.0002,2.1761,2.5411,1.1261,2.205,2.2562,2.2375,2.5546,1.3066,2.821,3.5892,4.8983,3.1205,4.4757,2.6195,5.525,5.4098,0.9766,2.9274,3.1055,0.8928,5.1843,2.6528,2.7049,4.9456,3.3702,1.0681,5.2678,0.5332,4.3935,4.2756,1.9228,0.6682,0.0001,4.7347,7.045,0.8321,0.0003,5.0398,0.823,3.4509,3.8713,4.5623,4.9126,0.9067,1.9899,4.9326,0.0006,3.1844,0.0237,0.9652,0.657,0.9101,0.1497,5.3614,1.2899,3.346,0.8682,2.2508,2.4332,1.749,1.7954,2.7632,1.0739,5.0439,1.5685,2.4178,4.5729,1.3678,4.5207,4.1252,0.1445,3.3299,3.7311,0.4227,0.0087,4.964,0.6901,2.794,4.5048,2.6927,0.0639,0.5922,4.4703,0.0004,5.0586,5.3168,2.6797,2.4468,0.0003,4.6301,3.9725,3.4557,3.4614,5.9914,5.6754,0.3772,1.2409,2.3387,5.7819,1.3618,0.078,1.0324,1.1619,1.905,3.6279,0.6896,4.5568,0.8601,1.4137,3.0089,1.6318,3.156,5.6699,0.0057,5.0042,2.4099,4.2169,0.8209,0.7312,5.6821,1.4554,0.287,1.3964,1.6196,0.8181,5.2099,5.6415,2.1597,0.6822,5.2732,0.4036,1.6132,4.6047,5.0757,5.0179,1.3326,4.285,1.5464,0.0019,0.001,0.332,1.0409,0.9381,0.7569,2.3666,1.2689,2.1529,2.8183,0.1717,1.2148,0.5326,2.2327,0.1745,0.6827,1.9112,3.6896,5.2992,1.2842,0.9471,6.6063,2.3078,0.8455,4.7861,2.7291,6.3552,0.0105,3.7468,0.9543,1.5648,0.0002,2.908,5.8203,2.7889,0.5525,0.2997,2.0819,2.8272,2.0074,4.0739,5.3964,3.7435,0.4616,1.8069,3.7513,2.3065,3.8492,3.9578,4.7401,2.1739,2.5364,2.7329,1.8725,1.9353,4.3821,2.4075,1.3793,5.5787,3.3056,2.0754,3.7092,1.7624,4.9933,4.9436,4.8255,1.8074,2.0412,2.9576,5.3544,0.0007,4.9946,2.3081,1.1862,0.5844,0.6783,4.5113,2.2167,0.4478,0.5161,1.0736,1.1943,4.5497,0.8861,1.5893,2.1338,1.5815,4.3561,3.5734,5.826,2.2494,2.3328,4.506,0.4424,4.7851,4.6515,2.405,4.6081,1.9872,5.6891,3.8976,2.2697,3.9599,2.4307,5.6755,3.6138,1.5672,5.8309,1.1094,4.4989,3.0265,3.7033,1.8765,3.1782,5.0759,3.458,0.7823,0.6091,5.9798,1.5199,0.0484,0.6372,0.4624,5.2218,2.3525,2.7948,0.118,0.1855,1.7932,1.9579,3.8897,4.4714,2.0822,2.9375,4.7523,1.3201,0.1204,4.2474,1.0812,4.6041,4.8206,1.1157,4.7397,1.1923,0.8243,0.0002,3.5715,0.3082,3.504,5.5273,2.3727,4.4983,0.3527,0.6925,0.7605,3.5639,5.387,4.951,1.8275,1.8129,2.6317,0.8178,2.8648,1.7002,3.8692,0.0239,0.0084,3.8752,1.6189,2.6498,4.3102,3.1761,1.9741,2.1539,1.3691,5.6384,4.6327,1.3203,3.4601,3.4445,4.376,3.248,1.6272,0.7858,0.0002,1.5284,5.464,0.9305,0.0001,5.4246,1.3711,0.1871,0.0051]}

{"id":3234,"ended":true,"length":542,"gen_text":"In the last 60 years several Commonwealth countries have introduced their own honours systems, separate from the British Honours System. Australia, Canada and New Zealand have each introduced their own decorations for senior military service honours in the year 2000 \/ 2001, with the exception of Canada (the Canadian Honours System has been introduced in 2005 \/ 2006 to replace the Honours system), while the new honours system replaces the Honours system.\n\nIn addition, honours programs are now available to the highest level of military service, and each service is subject to special regulations. However, these regulations were introduced in the 1970's, after being changed by President Eisenhower. Under the changes, military graduates were assigned their service uniform and were not sent home without a full ceremony, with a pay grade, or given an honorary degree or medal. This policy was to prevent future graduates being excluded from the same grade, which was known as the \"honour system \". The change required the uniform to contain a new decoration, which could include, for example, a full colour and embroidered scarf, a coat or some other decoration for all ranks.\n\nHonours programs are in line with the existing system, with honours programs issued to those who had already served. These honours programs are generally held at graduation ceremonies, where they are reviewed by senior officers. When a degree, which was already awarded, has been earned, then these institutions do not award further distinctions, which are the same as those awarded to military service members who have graduated from other Commonwealth countries. At graduation ceremonies, these honours programs are also held after graduation ceremonies in schools, with the same qualifications.\n\nIn addition, in 2004 the Commonwealth government introduced further honours, including a \"rewards package\" of up to $25,000 for high-status, military and civilian positions, which were issued upon returning from combat in Iraq, and could be awarded to senior high society members. The Commonwealth government also released the awards on Tuesday, March 26, 2008, at the annual conference in Sydney where the new honours program was introduced.\n\nThe Commonwealth honours system will be rolled out in 2020 when the Liberal Government moves to replace the Honours system.\n\nHonours\n\nA distinction will be applied to awards made by the National Defence and Foreign Affairs service, regardless of citizenship, including those made by the military. That is, the honours for higher status, such as officers, will be treated as honours only to high society members, while the honours awards for low status, such as senior, will be kept in the National Defence and Foreign Affairs Service.\n\nAll honours awards are issued if one of the following criteria are met - a high status, high merit test for each service, or the honours award itself is made by the military - or the honours award itself was granted by the Commonwealth.","token_len":584,"entropy":[2.6222,3.7794,6.3309,0.2559,7.9968,9.8365,1.896,0.1899,3.0796,4.385,0.0542,13.4515,0.1191,2.1098,1.4648,8.1421,0.6022,0.7831,4.6398,6.5605,0.0026,1.3373,0.7377,4.2673,1.6279,1.9896,1.1953,0.3507,0.0063,0.7353,5.0168,0.4471,0.7886,0.1517,10.5207,2.9549,6.4529,3.8542,2.374,4.2775,0.0003,3.5273,1.5998,5.9403,1.1205,8.1558,0.4067,1.9387,2.3498,1.0571,2.0354,0.0402,2.7414,2.9403,3.4082,3.7742,2.0453,0.0264,0.8853,3.224,0.8897,1.4904,1.1292,3.5065,2.3634,0.0209,4.4341,2.4149,0.2361,3.9202,0.0107,1.572,2.6343,2.861,1.2192,6.3507,1.297,0.0018,0.1031,5.6496,0.3965,2.3913,0.0062,0.1985,3.3595,1.1187,0.0023,2.7294,2.4065,0.6448,3.2741,0.0025,4.4182,1.7178,3.077,2.3515,1.1388,2.7749,3.983,1.7371,0.3683,1.5348,0.2105,1.7057,2.3773,5.067,4.1365,1.9801,3.6438,0.0039,5.1642,3.3234,1.1998,4.3215,0.0422,3.3392,1.2041,5.1527,1.6333,0.9972,2.2269,2.5607,3.4593,1.783,4.227,6.3593,5.2312,1.6027,6.077,4.1139,1.5997,4.1331,0.6303,4.3448,0.2266,2.7607,7.2181,2.4119,6.308,3.5161,3.6969,5.3412,1.7653,2.3713,2.1933,6.2485,2.241,2.6615,1.7944,3.9918,5.1636,2.1368,3.5127,2.3915,5.4447,2.9343,3.991,2.7924,4.9973,2.6606,3.024,1.2976,4.1964,2.9254,0.3402,2.8369,3.7318,1.1089,3.5169,2.445,3.7644,2.6875,3.4312,4.4611,0.1498,1.3858,4.1186,4.7644,2.6385,4.4867,1.6024,4.7212,0.0524,1.1647,1.4967,2.9216,0.6265,0.64,8.1441,2.3764,4.2598,5.5216,2.1172,4.9213,1.2888,5.3312,1.1348,4.6125,2.597,1.4401,2.141,3.4964,2.6906,4.3613,1.3641,0.0746,0.0911,0.7042,5.2822,3.838,4.8717,4.6118,0.0565,5.3716,1.0696,1.6886,5.2703,2.3048,5.4811,0.4627,2.3586,4.2318,4.549,2.5111,0.8401,1.0695,0.0003,2.5237,0.1231,2.4274,1.3837,4.7085,4.6903,0.0024,0.6912,4.7517,1.8965,1.1959,2.1276,3.007,0.0046,2.36,5.711,1.351,2.7,0.5993,2.8679,4.4558,1.4351,2.795,3.1703,1.1914,0.0047,0.3362,1.1031,4.3924,4.4459,2.0208,5.7659,1.1285,1.0283,2.4585,2.6577,0.5061,5.4182,0.8822,2.1171,1.4014,1.6423,4.8482,1.5867,5.4804,3.8967,3.7276,1.8458,4.7614,1.5535,1.0213,2.396,0.5233,4.7332,0.5564,3.0309,5.5784,6.4575,4.6273,0.1962,3.2052,4.4017,6.8916,1.9916,2.9474,2.0294,4.5283,1.7827,0.4306,1.0954,1.7823,0.8687,3.5267,1.7348,1.8366,2.3594,1.2838,5.052,1.3224,3.2913,3.9378,1.5256,0.3135,6.2691,2.2649,0.1523,0.309,3.1141,0.4758,0.0065,0.37,0.3066,2.7409,0.9635,5.7027,2.0079,0.2539,2.3999,4.8243,1.2596,3.5592,1.544,2.8343,3.9432,2.6045,0.6626,0.0002,2.744,1.602,0.5546,3.5922,5.1411,1.7371,2.004,3.0515,0.9821,6.7915,1.141,0.0013,4.2074,1.842,2.0172,3.7647,5.7452,2.2105,4.9867,0.556,2.428,4.0906,0.0024,0.8754,3.3409,0.289,0.0256,1.2877,5.0684,0.9755,3.9772,3.1007,4.0647,2.8561,1.6146,4.713,1.4182,2.537,2.4828,4.1433,6.636,6.1315,1.0367,4.1768,2.0955,1.1231,2.0794,2.2216,4.7681,0.5523,2.6681,0.9386,3.5226,5.9705,6.3025,2.0622,1.4303,1.8982,3.9796,1.388,0.9829,5.5293,2.5206,5.8437,5.0663,5.3573,0.9334,3.255,3.4973,0.6206,2.9376,1.1014,3.5483,0.7986,2.6018,3.1644,3.1068,2.0546,4.0124,1.1858,4.058,0.2584,0.0036,2.6926,0.3902,0.5968,0.2245,0.5429,0.0002,1.9439,2.211,1.6437,0.0061,0.1692,4.5606,1.2373,4.5015,0.0319,1.1809,4.0577,4.103,0.9136,5.2096,2.086,4.9649,0.3289,4.0824,0.2842,1.8306,0.0049,0.1124,1.2663,1.4796,0.0003,2.4279,0.0769,2.9913,0.0002,3.4254,4.6171,3.5037,0.2294,6.6226,0.3099,5.6291,2.074,1.7926,1.2576,4.6728,0.6389,3.0566,2.7356,1.9451,6.1806,1.6279,4.6189,0.0083,6.0762,1.5873,5.1018,1.578,2.3599,0.7326,1.2105,3.3343,1.7739,6.6169,2.1796,0.5012,1.7289,1.565,0.0036,5.071,5.7961,3.8086,2.2122,1.419,0.0023,4.0834,1.2693,2.2899,0.3877,5.9505,0.833,3.0099,0.0001,3.1137,2.6577,4.374,4.5691,0.6332,1.7381,2.2965,1.617,0.4409,0.0012,3.6021,0.7903,3.2509,0.2248,0.4528,0.0645,0.0011,4.0041,5.6044,1.0965,0.2456,6.5292,1.9709,1.0221,3.1604,0.0835,0.527,0.0845,0.0038,2.3901,0.8553,0.474,0.0002,4.6992,1.1733,0.001,1.1601,1.6816,3.6797,6.6747,4.541,0.5955,0.2114,0.1769,1.5256,2.6305,0.1374,5.3347,2.4743,2.6746,2.487,1.2879,1.2307,4.839,5.9563,4.4208,4.3417,2.2926,1.1881,1.7901,2.4354,2.7153,0.0074,1.7606,4.8443,0.9258,5.0066,1.5256,1.521,2.3839,2.6768,4.354,1.9746,1.2344,0.0042,0.5016,0.6301,2.7898,4.3768,0.8888,0.5272,3.0746,1.6696]}

The only time a fine will be issued for a violation within a particular time is if the law was changed during the period.","token_len":584,"entropy":[7.4485,5.4365,14.4917,3.1152,6.695,3.1917,2.47,9.2185,4.1409,2.6047,3.4407,5.1456,3.1497,1.6498,4.8072,0.4727,9.6051,4.2475,8.3165,4.9123,1.1638,4.0576,1.1342,2.0911,1.7568,1.0099,3.924,0.1747,6.2172,0.286,0.0196,0.5443,5.5908,2.5194,3.4889,14.0337,0.2079,1.0409,1.9295,0.7393,4.4938,5.3415,0.8971,1.8066,0.0829,1.5409,0.3565,0.9634,0.0033,5.9265,6.1954,3.4255,1.0303,1.0026,3.7537,0.0977,5.2148,4.3614,2.8512,0.948,1.3214,0.014,1.5943,2.208,1.9126,3.7129,1.7116,0.8211,3.1963,3.7486,2.7517,1.0284,0.0311,0.7203,3.2045,4.2004,5.02,2.6087,3.1479,4.105,0.2546,3.8901,0.4962,1.5856,0.9998,1.6808,3.4584,1.6142,2.5667,0.0024,4.6992,1.6859,0.1994,6.305,3.2609,4.3961,1.0908,0.5134,0.6922,0.0002,1.6147,1.3793,3.6788,1.0174,5.1885,2.8483,3.8556,3.3361,2.796,2.6599,3.706,2.644,2.7184,0.7118,1.5784,1.6156,1.1994,2.9876,5.0541,2.1113,2.86,4.9739,5.5045,1.0183,6.364,0.964,0.4386,1.8061,3.1338,0.1243,0.8236,6.358,1.2086,4.1308,1.9709,2.7417,0.8667,0.0002,3.5221,5.2767,4.5468,2.9187,6.0671,0.5341,4.8399,1.5752,1.6724,3.0142,3.3592,1.3747,0.6411,2.2752,3.113,0.7577,3.2907,0.7677,1.3372,1.2514,0.0002,3.7525,3.2345,2.4984,4.4492,3.8065,2.5916,3.6255,0.549,1.8278,3.761,6.2605,0.2841,5.7936,0.3988,0.808,4.1429,0.3611,2.7449,0.1387,1.2056,1.508,2.9655,0.9317,0.2224,1.1388,1.6522,3.6186,2.4783,4.2091,3.3016,1.998,0.5148,0.537,1.8327,3.9213,2.3397,2.9659,2.9826,0.1251,0.9045,0.6959,0.0002,4.3098,1.8033,0.6967,2.4802,1.2371,0.9576,2.6193,3.6857,2.0945,2.1236,3.3038,4.7161,0.7027,2.3403,3.478,1.8876,1.1258,0.3874,5.3753,0.0437,4.6274,1.1012,0.5324,3.616,0.0062,4.1294,1.4347,4.6034,0.1366,4.4618,2.7003,4.5897,1.6455,0.1649,0.4368,4.2983,2.2733,1.8596,0.2251,5.8981,2.2519,0.2277,0.0001,2.8674,1.8865,1.1552,4.3065,1.1906,4.8184,2.1006,3.9604,2.6436,0.3337,5.4854,0.0001,1.6814,3.1441,1.6082,1.0991,1.0259,0.6619,1.3158,4.4658,2.5376,0.0701,2.877,1.4249,2.1599,1.9995,5.1387,1.3692,1.2117,1.1341,2.5878,4.7178,1.2186,1.8404,3.2621,0.432,0.296,0.4254,3.5216,2.6109,0.0002,0.5743,2.9443,2.4759,1.5007,1.4323,1.9023,5.2843,3.7262,6.7479,1.5646,5.0378,2.7971,4.3445,1.0804,2.4872,0.6549,4.6659,1.4163,0.0002,0.6453,0.9874,4.0946,0.8276,3.3992,2.5846,2.6364,2.5443,0.0109,1.0965,3.0098,3.0771,2.9588,8.1117,1.4875,0.0197,0.6031,4.581,0.7922,0.091,0.053,2.1531,0.3673,5.3821,0.5747,0.9972,2.7472,6.7566,3.8137,5.8632,2.9227,2.0699,0.3491,1.3377,5.4913,0.3197,5.844,4.9942,0.501,0.699,4.5523,0.7476,2.2169,0.0371,1.9976,4.5141,2.1967,0.9692,4.0462,0.9221,1.5629,4.1702,3.8597,0.021,0.9106,3.2146,0.9123,5.5397,5.6573,1.2832,2.1113,5.024,5.2195,2.1582,5.5157,2.2727,3.7274,3.641,4.8752,2.9337,0.988,3.5049,2.0185,2.2185,2.6599,1.6206,3.6727,0.7522,0.0013,0.2321,2.2195,1.1883,0.0528,0.6806,5.2061,4.7423,1.8133,2.5804,1.2645,0.5259,1.9238,1.5518,4.8241,1.7825,0.3943,0.5532,0.5361,0.6727,0.0002,2.459,6.7041,2.3264,0.8044,5.146,4.2628,0.8708,1.5619,3.3822,5.0519,0.4029,0.2309,0.3726,0.2478,4.563,3.2808,3.0304,4.0559,6.6295,0.7962,0.6529,4.6384,2.6293,0.9569,0.2779,0.6495,2.0302,0.0996,4.0766,1.5887,1.7573,3.079,3.9754,3.0896,0.5156,0.5145,3.7982,4.0641,2.5434,4.0967,1.7126,0.0343,0.5707,0.6386,0.8035,0.0002,2.042,2.6297,1.4631,2.9985,3.3087,0.0288,0.5144,6.4464,2.4065,1.8025,3.4556,0.0206,1.1301,5.199,0.5568,0.2526,4.2045,2.2601,0.213,0.3838,4.4215,0.5618,1.7209,0.785,0.0688,1.3744,1.4759,5.0745,1.9231,3.5558,2.1788,0.1822,0.425,0.4845,3.3814,3.8811,2.3571,2.9562,0.9682,0.4494,2.182,0.022,0.0087,1.0382,0.0313,0.1444,0.3116,5.4254,0.5991,4.5826,1.1359,0.5367,0.6257,3.6345,2.5378,0.9349,0.8321,0.0002,1.3521,0.469,0.9876,4.3824,0.0294,3.7609,1.7866,1.2934,3.0295,1.8555,6.1868,6.4879,3.9139,2.4328,2.7394,1.9805,1.3493,0.4885,5.0752,6.3091,6.0929,4.028,4.7241,1.3809,0.2262,0.5489,0.6458,5.2197,1.8297,0.5128,0.0154,0.868,3.5677,4.3825,0.2611,2.7366,0.2757,2.4656,1.5045,5.17,0.3769,2.2704,4.6899,7.0217,0.1576,0.1614,0.4715,3.7825,1.0416,0.1836,0.1748,2.8042,5.209,3.1181,1.6734,2.237,0.8273,0.0541,0.0912,2.8165,0.6491,0.5703,6.6812,1.2151,3.2316,1.5569,1.4405,0.6132,1.1251,5.5782,4.886,0.7652,3.4609,0.5055,4.0444,2.9405]}
{"id":3105,"ended":false,"length":540,"gen_text":"The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 93 % approval rating with an average rating of 8 @. @ 1 \/ 10 based on 54 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads \"Beware of the dark and be careful what you wish for\":\n\nBut what's so dangerous with Rotten Tomatoes is its tendency to make you think that you're really doing something wrong \u2013 that you might be thinking you're helping the world. How do you feel before you spend six weeks of your life getting up in the middle of the night and writing about politics, science and religion while writing about the internet?\n\nFor all we know you might still be feeling paranoid. There's a simple but effective way to prevent that for fear of sounding paranoid: do some self-education.\n\nFor any online or offline person, there's a number of ways to reduce your internet exposure. These include using some kind of non-smoking, non-dietary or anti-social social networking sites.\n\nI can't stress this enough \u2013 we need to stop treating online news like some form of criminal activity. We need good moderation, good moderation in any way we can. A good moderation is not something that just gets in the way of the good news.\n\nThe most popular moderation site (which the US State Department created in 2011) has 5,000 followers on the site. For each 3,000 users, there is an 11% boost in their traffic and an 8% increase in the number of friends they have over the course of 1 year. The two leading sites, Reddit and Google+ are even better, with 1\/2-billion and 0-million unique visitors respectively; it's a significant leap in traffic. The US is known for moderation, so in effect this has created a very real problem. One way to counter the negative impact of Internet moderation is simply to have a bad time with people. If you are being sarcastic, be polite. People will respond positively to you. They will take you seriously.\n\nMost people will respond negatively with negative responses, so be polite, but you have a right to be respectful. If you want to be respectful, follow the rules. Don't be afraid to comment.\n\nHave a good time with others. The more you know, the more you should be doing. There are many ways to do this though, and the internet is definitely different than living in a dream world \u2013 there's absolutely nothing worse than to think about yourself as you write about politics or religions or culture.\n\nThe right balance between being friendly with others and behaving responsibly is a very important thing. I want you to take a step back and take a good hard look at yourself, how you present yourself and where you believe you fit in. Remember: just like human beings, you can be different.\n\nRead more from YT:","token_len":585,"entropy":[8.6611,11.2427,5.8637,6.4436,6.8707,2.2175,0.1445,0.0,4.4945,3.0518,5.9017,6.7535,2.7832,0.2087,4.3702,3.4716,0.5818,1.9265,0.0258,3.6177,14.2128,5.2574,8.1399,9.3169,5.4551,2.2134,5.2793,0.0472,6.4007,0.6898,0.5412,2.1661,4.1362,2.6034,7.9919,4.5857,7.2366,1.5264,5.2351,2.0902,1.0825,2.1194,4.9242,2.446,5.0094,1.8229,1.8439,0.0221,0.118,0.0041,5.355,0.6088,0.02,6.185,2.8388,2.2338,3.4044,4.0347,5.3656,4.1472,0.0016,0.0052,0.0001,2.2037,2.5593,2.7296,0.0998,3.5689,3.0166,1.9696,2.0097,1.8755,1.1041,4.6687,3.9435,1.194,1.4301,4.772,2.0741,0.8951,3.7238,1.2202,5.4446,3.2969,0.4884,5.0764,1.6818,3.192,1.5515,5.6836,1.9765,0.3562,3.5225,6.7491,0.6826,5.5414,5.7419,2.7845,3.7168,0.1296,0.1254,5.1501,4.1335,2.4871,0.1538,3.0521,0.0048,0.2769,0.0319,1.4298,4.4055,2.1609,5.2255,1.1437,3.4589,1.6536,3.0548,4.6549,3.6984,0.9899,2.5651,4.3815,0.6661,1.1166,0.0003,4.512,4.0612,3.9732,0.045,4.0174,1.5849,4.8053,0.5171,3.8366,6.1069,1.3947,4.9252,0.676,1.3451,4.6629,3.0874,1.5831,1.1038,0.2764,3.589,1.6898,5.9654,5.403,0.3662,4.6109,1.8588,1.787,4.9283,2.4383,4.164,0.0501,4.8349,0.4938,0.9644,0.0002,4.4338,5.1879,5.2408,4.4365,0.3035,1.7312,0.9534,2.6149,0.7866,1.0482,3.9579,0.0629,2.4512,0.3379,4.2712,1.4703,4.69,2.6294,0.6278,4.0244,0.497,2.7957,4.1256,2.3793,0.0016,5.9029,0.0211,4.4498,2.8826,1.8331,0.0095,3.7211,0.169,1.4441,3.2938,2.9472,0.0033,4.3674,4.2453,2.5791,2.5812,1.7332,1.5904,0.0001,4.3117,4.2979,0.8408,1.6071,0.7026,0.0108,2.4455,4.6995,1.9683,0.3174,2.5404,5.2614,3.0554,4.1894,1.4726,4.0576,3.7476,0.0031,5.9972,0.6041,0.5196,2.5557,0.5437,8.0531,5.2614,1.797,2.5656,2.0996,2.2097,4.872,3.0222,0.753,0.3469,0.9667,5.3114,2.153,1.0648,1.8036,2.5902,3.344,1.0727,3.2044,4.2249,1.8522,0.1321,0.005,0.0667,2.3273,2.135,2.0574,0.62,1.1123,0.0002,2.9842,3.8261,3.3095,3.4161,3.7076,4.4315,3.4147,5.448,3.9213,4.1477,0.0673,5.087,1.3441,2.4468,0.6413,2.7316,5.8083,0.8835,1.0632,3.9704,3.4841,2.9877,2.2668,0.9869,4.5179,4.117,4.25,0.5491,0.1157,2.9975,0.9102,1.3526,2.0529,1.9549,4.6811,1.0879,5.5793,0.2443,2.5043,5.0054,2.8381,2.753,1.4164,0.0757,1.2744,0.0348,1.8683,1.05,0.0114,5.7134,1.0816,0.8061,5.5489,0.3352,1.3911,0.0009,5.9951,0.5305,0.152,2.7133,5.7947,4.5699,1.5003,2.3439,2.4985,0.0777,3.8314,2.1568,1.4911,4.8038,1.841,1.9903,0.9983,3.3688,4.396,3.2206,3.4102,3.3227,3.937,3.6633,4.9682,2.8037,4.2633,1.0379,0.3716,5.6319,3.4353,0.3709,1.9589,4.6969,5.0121,1.8588,1.4233,1.5053,3.5866,3.8408,2.8673,4.8622,0.3712,4.1905,1.1433,2.543,5.0717,5.1526,3.2255,3.6529,3.778,0.5348,4.2195,3.3237,2.5276,1.1634,5.7106,3.0429,0.5011,4.9815,2.4177,2.5526,2.0315,0.3134,5.7164,2.4827,0.2309,5.318,0.2971,3.9005,1.3295,5.2784,2.1502,2.5807,2.3654,1.017,3.8032,0.4357,2.5115,4.6195,3.2609,1.025,3.4021,2.8017,1.474,5.6116,1.457,3.2667,3.118,0.625,0.5856,1.0681,3.8388,0.8127,4.5243,1.9643,0.8051,0.5489,1.0688,0.0001,5.5207,1.5815,2.5984,2.6898,2.4139,5.8917,3.151,2.9667,1.7368,2.3809,2.7377,1.8511,2.5459,1.9736,3.3992,2.9619,2.7582,1.5183,0.0454,1.1375,2.626,0.796,2.5185,0.3755,3.877,0.2725,1.5895,3.0809,0.6649,5.4604,0.9023,0.9716,0.8594,2.6423,0.0004,1.7685,3.9667,0.1626,5.8555,1.5641,2.2146,0.0001,5.5496,0.8839,1.2328,0.6163,2.1185,3.5656,0.5843,3.7871,2.1448,1.7117,2.9979,1.7765,0.018,0.5555,0.9685,4.7373,1.0999,2.262,0.823,4.4054,0.9624,2.0143,1.1183,0.247,2.3941,0.4298,6.7887,1.2852,1.2935,2.9092,4.1858,0.8861,4.7979,4.3557,1.2144,6.395,0.5996,0.6466,4.73,0.589,3.5414,3.0759,1.3199,6.3305,1.6343,3.4038,0.1555,4.4052,3.937,2.69,3.0392,1.3689,2.2839,3.6855,1.7538,1.4208,2.368,4.8713,1.5383,5.2325,1.0783,0.8309,0.0002,3.0695,5.2719,4.2731,1.6048,2.2645,4.3118,2.2661,0.5865,0.2054,5.8909,3.4346,1.222,2.4581,2.2763,0.7655,2.2213,0.953,3.6228,4.1898,2.2688,0.062,3.6463,1.6853,2.7872,0.137,0.4552,3.3624,0.169,4.9616,3.8281,0.0078,0.0989,0.8675,2.4174,4.947,0.1632,5.5268,0.0801,1.1287,3.809,0.12,6.2365,0.4472,2.7627,0.6841,0.7041,5.1018,3.0573,5.4867,3.4344,6.248,0.1848,0.4625,1.2473,2.2922,2.0508,4.1465,0.7629,0.8401,0.0002,4.6335,1.3061,2.1787,4.7963,4.3663,1.7329]}
{"id":2465,"ended":true,"length":486,"gen_text":"In the Treaty of St. Peters ( 1837 ), the government sought the pine timber resources on Ojibwa lands. They intended to float the harvested timber southwest into the Mississippi River. The next year, the Government in St. Francis of Assisi proposed the formation of a Department of Natural Resources with jurisdiction over the Pine River Basin.\n\nThe new department would be led by Deputy Secretary of the State for Water Resources, Robert C.

{"id":4879,"ended":true,"length":532,"gen_text":"Following his release from Exeter City, McAllister moved back to non @ - @ League, signing for Conference Premier outfit Crawley Town on a one @ - @ year contract, in June 2008 after three spells in English football. The move to Liverpool put him at odds with his old club's long-standing relationship with the North East League club.\nAn interesting story about McAllister's time in Liverpool is that he has been linked with a number of different clubs before his arrival and is currently in Australia.\nHe played a game in Northampton where he looked at the game-winning goal and was given a shot to the face. The play continued with him in Sydney who were also the referee and he scored from there. He then flew to Melbourne where he scored again. A few days later his name appeared on a list of South Melbourne clubs listed on the Football Federation of Australia (FFA). One of this was also an AFL club. He also had the great fortune of having won the 'Lame Star Cup', meaning that he was accepted as the highest scorers at the MCG during the season.\nHe was a very prolific scorer for a Premier League club and when he was out for the 2013 AFL season, he scored seven tries, including his first goal (a 45-yarder). He was named to one of the 10,000 best players for the rest of the year by Football Federation Australia.\nMcAllister spent 15 seasons in the game, scoring at 18.7 per cent on 50 of his 41 match games in 2013-14. The two game-winners of 2013-14 were Aaron West and David Meyler, and he scored 30 tries for the club before leaving Northampton, Australia for Adelaide in February 2015.\nAlthough he still managed to score for the club, I would say his greatest season was 2009 where he scored 36 tries in 54 games for Adelaide. He is now part of the All Stars in Perth team and is one of only three players (McMahon, McDonagh, and McIver) to have scored 60 goals last season.\nIn any event, he managed to stay away from Australia due to medical reasons after the final one game.\nOne of the biggest upsets of his time was having to play for Northampton Town in 2011, a match where he scored one goal. The day after the game though, the Swans scored another goal and the club decided to make the trip to England to pay their fine out of pocket price to the High Court.\nIf you are going to judge, it is hard to believe but he played for this side to play in the Premier League then.\nMcAllister is on his way back to the City of Melbourne to take the Magpies to the 2018 finals. He is looking for a return to South Melbourne, who also have a big deal under their belt.","token_len":586,"entropy":[5.2218,4.004,0.9413,10.302,2.6209,4.1591,1.3051,7.0263,3.333,0.0021,4.7583,3.6133,0.2535,10.7531,13.8165,10.1164,5.3136,8.6995,4.9064,7.5617,1.8763,11.0626,6.2048,2.9889,6.622,0.0453,1.9387,2.7327,1.6423,2.4195,11.4272,3.0869,1.5852,3.7962,1.6345,3.3157,4.575,4.3317,4.3915,4.9519,4.4254,3.8491,1.4159,4.3904,0.3953,0.345,3.0968,3.4172,2.4114,5.3039,5.5856,0.5832,2.3678,3.6919,0.0127,2.0332,4.19,0.3408,2.7086,4.7746,0.3412,1.1145,3.661,0.0273,1.2866,4.2222,1.8914,4.1064,1.6496,0.998,1.2402,11.3117,4.9512,3.4314,2.7844,1.7487,0.0059,0.0003,1.1436,2.3023,1.1112,1.9535,2.2509,0.9557,0.7453,4.084,1.8431,3.726,0.2891,1.1834,2.7488,0.001,3.1619,0.6966,3.8173,3.2238,2.1475,3.5153,3.6298,2.6656,2.643,5.9435,1.7564,2.0406,2.8254,3.3335,2.8644,4.8148,2.0469,4.8461,1.6578,5.3532,0.3594,5.4005,4.2272,1.7754,2.3312,4.1587,1.1752,0.1986,2.1075,2.5071,3.8206,0.7588,4.7659,2.2069,2.3053,2.6066,1.7112,2.4885,5.1811,5.5886,3.016,2.4959,2.9661,4.2531,6.0323,3.4103,4.0125,4.8689,5.7524,2.592,3.2617,3.106,3.7841,3.3274,0.5667,2.1288,2.5098,4.3443,0.7329,2.6153,0.8363,0.1775,2.7514,2.9804,1.8212,4.7286,1.7119,1.6175,0.1929,4.1086,2.7805,2.6681,0.4178,1.9234,1.7671,0.1464,5.9457,3.6065,2.5024,6.306,1.5088,0.8766,2.7112,1.2723,0.2248,0.0734,3.516,1.3558,0.092,0.889,5.2721,0.6734,5.725,3.0978,4.5437,3.8717,2.6082,0.8991,1.2269,2.6738,2.7222,3.0083,3.2938,6.0944,3.0381,0.4656,2.7313,3.9788,0.9436,5.1672,4.9201,4.6847,5.7318,3.9392,2.539,5.8551,2.2801,0.6881,1.3112,5.8388,2.4639,2.3159,4.4593,4.7565,0.1824,2.6804,0.8238,5.2521,0.0066,4.7744,0.7814,2.8188,0.3966,0.6872,2.4997,1.6496,2.6869,3.2793,4.153,1.6217,1.9769,3.6518,4.7063,0.0842,0.7693,1.4294,5.3607,0.7116,1.6092,4.381,3.3076,1.5057,4.1282,6.0855,0.3981,1.6742,0.5236,1.1173,4.4305,3.1483,2.8723,2.4837,3.3958,1.8283,2.1824,5.0869,2.6313,5.4248,0.495,0.2598,1.4823,2.3696,1.0669,1.5962,3.2269,1.7359,5.6666,0.0649,0.3382,4.1773,5.1974,0.12,3.0779,1.562,3.8404,0.8247,6.1518,0.0005,0.4514,1.7005,2.5714,1.5161,1.7449,0.0779,0.7943,0.9908,1.7581,0.0491,0.0016,4.7872,6.0024,1.451,1.0944,1.0077,5.6037,1.9681,1.0961,4.8243,5.9599,1.0228,2.849,0.4951,0.2116,4.5886,4.5393,5.2705,0.8663,4.8442,5.4607,4.4654,3.518,2.8018,1.196,0.0243,0.4404,3.2416,5.6558,5.9892,2.5775,3.5558,0.023,2.1377,2.6105,0.4133,0.0035,0.9267,5.2828,4.9457,1.3538,4.5596,4.7332,1.418,0.3978,1.761,2.9858,1.5765,1.5235,4.7103,1.3973,2.0196,1.1926,2.2614,3.7295,3.4187,5.505,0.7081,3.7301,3.783,1.7544,5.1217,1.6653,3.6335,1.8228,0.3036,0.7739,5.9873,0.8367,5.3117,2.8493,0.468,0.838,4.1853,1.3061,1.2592,1.243,6.2558,2.5131,2.2466,2.753,5.8079,3.2101,0.73,4.3164,3.2061,0.0645,0.6758,4.7712,0.3698,2.2058,4.8621,0.7824,1.6382,2.4782,0.9136,1.2292,4.3006,2.1923,4.3528,0.0721,0.5898,4.9332,2.7065,3.9286,5.0417,2.8275,1.4372,2.1695,2.409,0.0169,2.0796,1.7295,0.5457,4.6313,4.9917,5.5621,0.5491,0.5672,3.3432,4.2564,0.2859,0.9158,2.3608,2.7308,5.2561,1.4212,0.1005,0.4497,1.3438,0.9637,4.4862,1.8749,5.7327,0.1582,0.4729,0.7588,2.9007,5.4545,1.8017,0.1839,1.7097,4.9273,0.1867,3.0097,2.8902,0.0467,4.6203,3.9364,0.015,5.7512,0.7025,4.4881,2.1507,5.5205,5.1021,1.9529,3.3999,1.7428,4.627,0.7276,0.4984,3.0336,4.134,0.2964,2.1941,0.5548,2.489,3.7823,5.3505,0.3695,2.6406,1.4226,3.8759,0.4004,3.7224,1.3686,4.2113,2.34,3.9807,2.6673,2.3465,0.3533,0.8959,4.0767,0.7382,1.664,2.4697,5.576,1.0336,1.2396,0.7257,6.5229,0.3991,2.9106,5.1119,0.0214,4.7951,2.2603,1.6672,2.038,2.847,3.4883,4.1049,0.2567,3.7544,2.1696,3.0685,0.5674,4.6485,1.4751,6.2479,1.8025,4.0361,4.9815,0.1314,1.2528,7.3629,2.8811,2.1959,5.9467,0.7897,0.7988,1.0672,5.4828,0.7088,1.9985,3.9224,0.0657,5.4189,5.3205,3.6689,1.0826,3.1093,0.2407,2.0414,4.1218,2.7629,2.992,1.3023,6.3557,2.5924,4.7934,3.858,1.8599,0.7791,2.609,0.0407,5.8328,3.0459,1.6248,1.8317,0.4092,0.0015,2.5596,4.9919,2.5641,0.9079,1.2249,0.2527,1.993,5.7885,0.4294,2.9882,2.5279,3.2325,3.2935,5.5186,0.0681,0.0001,0.7312,0.5359,4.3818,4.083,0.6556,1.6252,1.3548,3.1934,2.2526,0.6658,3.451,0.0979,3.8799,0.3828,2.5659,4.3851,4.8499,1.6723,0.8929,4.1813,5.3315,3.4899,1.3249,0.8899,0.8951]}
{"id":2578,"ended":true,"length":543,"gen_text":"The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. H\u00e4kkinen said that he was `` pleased `` to win the race and admitted that he had never won one in his career. The team manager, who had been invited to his home in Nuremberg for the race, told H\u00e4kkinen that the first stage was not a hard time and he would have to work harder for the podium.'' This had been before his first season with the team.\n\nHe said on the day he had to prepare for the race and that he has no problem meeting new people, that being a member of the top three is not difficult. To this day, he said that on the podium it was hard to tell people with a simple smile, that they were `` going to love it.'' He also admitted that he has always liked to try his best, that he won this race hard and that after a couple hundred kilometers the atmosphere is really beautiful.\n\nH\u00e4kkinen also said that he was also feeling happy after a second time he got his first victory, his fourth time he got his first title in this race.\n\nH\u00f6ller added that on Saturday morning, H\u00e4kkinen stopped his coach when he got very tired from finishing a practice where they had been training. When he finished, he returned to work, with only a few minutes left before the race had been finished, H\u00e4kkinen said: `` I am really happy I got the victory at the end of the race. It was the first victory in my past three races and even now, it feels great. It is a little bitter because I lost the first one, because my mentality went too far the second time, but you have to understand that this was my first winning time at my age. It was all in the spirit which was used in the past.'' The H\u00e4kkinen team manager's words indicated that he felt that the team was not just happy over the winning. The team manager, who had previously said that he was tired of going through tough years, admitted that he could be happy in the end; he was going to get the title at the end of the race, and it did turn out well. This time around, H\u00e4kkinen said, he thought about winning one more time. H\u00e4kkinen also said that he was satisfied at the finale that he had beaten the fastest German after 10 hours of training and thought that this kind of victory would be the key. He added that during the first training session, some of his teammates kept telling him to stay calm and that he was doing well. The training session that H\u00e4kkinen has completed, he said, was very difficult and he needed a very good team, all of these players had their problems, so that there was no time to complain.","token_len":586,"entropy":[6.6897,2.7575,6.1869,8.8973,2.3437,0.9005,4.4194,3.7003,7.3723,1.9815,5.0158,2.926,5.5458,3.1471,5.7988,3.8426,0.0552,5.0072,7.7494,4.1102,2.1101,0.1497,0.0001,2.7619,1.8488,1.3889,1.7991,12.0429,11.044,6.816,1.171,2.013,0.9,4.4649,1.9663,8.0408,0.418,0.6395,1.7156,3.5888,3.6229,3.7479,2.5551,1.1653,2.1786,0.9945,2.9563,3.2591,3.1981,2.0576,3.3803,1.9196,1.6007,5.3218,0.4905,4.1049,1.6215,1.437,5.5605,1.5008,0.0366,2.6239,0.6526,1.6137,0.2186,2.7107,2.4257,0.005,0.007,0.0009,0.0002,0.4713,2.0493,4.8619,4.0507,0.9544,2.7017,2.9381,5.7266,4.9939,2.2351,2.3286,2.1838,2.7713,1.7516,3.5076,2.2449,2.6226,0.9,3.5599,2.3473,4.94,5.1055,1.1344,5.9366,3.0902,3.6523,3.5829,1.7616,0.8419,0.5839,0.9716,2.0748,0.0429,3.5707,1.7007,5.46,1.2782,2.6537,2.4041,2.5835,3.5167,4.5835,0.6543,0.3524,1.6828,3.3035,1.8473,0.7466,5.6675,3.4936,3.0654,5.7377,4.4707,1.1404,2.2583,3.3883,6.6813,1.7542,4.314,0.0244,0.3373,5.1257,1.3204,1.8661,1.9572,2.9894,1.092,5.9471,3.2476,3.53,0.7277,0.7989,1.781,1.4039,5.2617,0.8118,3.3106,3.6806,1.5931,2.6578,0.6762,3.2463,3.9636,5.6708,2.1865,5.565,1.7983,2.112,1.3985,2.3202,1.7874,5.5975,4.7569,0.2208,4.3154,1.3685,0.8664,1.8349,2.1916,3.3362,0.176,1.0009,2.7216,2.9377,2.9253,1.3579,5.2352,3.209,0.8719,1.66,1.3231,0.9986,5.3065,4.5594,0.4328,5.4243,1.2876,0.6812,4.9732,2.9041,3.4786,5.5828,0.614,2.6981,4.8667,3.4714,4.1596,5.2985,0.3864,0.8443,0.0002,1.7569,0.0243,0.0092,0.0013,0.0004,2.4721,1.4214,0.1978,0.8779,2.0701,4.9409,4.7327,4.4382,3.1262,3.157,5.5608,3.8447,5.25,4.7395,3.0736,0.8013,2.0882,2.2549,4.527,3.2195,3.3801,3.2262,2.7453,0.8248,0.7419,4.381,2.902,3.3778,0.5702,0.5896,1.6113,0.0002,2.0087,4.3548,5.0669,3.4964,0.3306,3.9723,3.5583,2.9122,1.5926,1.8526,0.0959,0.009,0.0021,0.0004,5.5778,2.7571,5.3381,4.7882,0.4957,3.5498,5.1232,1.6565,2.8296,5.5726,2.8078,3.3154,6.1256,4.9066,0.8239,2.1508,2.8833,1.2992,3.7512,0.9012,3.537,1.0688,0.6864,5.4629,0.3942,3.3897,2.0974,4.1113,4.7185,1.4004,0.9344,1.3498,0.9883,2.3593,0.5813,1.556,3.9617,3.419,2.1471,2.7644,3.4607,1.0785,0.0097,0.0028,0.0004,0.8699,3.6237,0.352,2.0074,2.8943,3.1776,0.621,4.33,1.7544,1.8584,1.973,4.997,0.6834,1.464,0.6173,0.4361,1.354,0.9943,2.0774,0.6558,2.8364,1.3195,2.9689,2.2768,0.8551,7.2381,1.9769,0.7109,1.7248,5.9607,3.9246,2.1572,2.4511,2.6746,2.6057,1.2823,1.9972,1.2918,1.7634,4.4958,5.9087,2.4412,0.6505,2.6638,1.4834,1.1984,2.7948,1.6706,4.2212,3.3852,6.0075,4.5477,3.7642,0.3974,5.8412,1.3085,0.9732,2.0501,1.1687,5.3275,1.8508,0.1041,3.3472,0.7804,2.7799,1.7161,2.273,0.5489,6.04,3.2387,2.982,5.2295,1.8602,1.0204,2.0431,0.7811,4.976,3.4372,2.2992,2.7914,5.9325,2.391,4.9593,1.6649,0.7311,2.9828,2.0342,4.1324,5.021,0.2016,0.0189,0.0077,0.0088,1.5384,1.8383,5.4635,1.9629,5.6533,0.366,1.6003,3.4357,1.0227,1.7627,1.8566,1.2674,3.0734,4.1501,2.9964,6.0512,0.7657,4.953,3.5914,2.7976,1.1368,1.5299,3.0712,0.8735,0.6433,4.3105,2.788,0.2087,0.8167,1.5649,5.2812,1.4151,5.1227,2.3288,4.4978,3.7304,0.69,3.768,0.2149,0.8254,4.5885,4.6907,2.3499,3.4428,0.8988,1.8211,5.8705,1.2938,2.0372,4.9119,0.3409,3.4555,1.975,3.0019,3.2254,0.2621,0.2492,0.57,0.2554,0.5595,1.7501,2.2157,3.038,4.9978,7.2316,0.0679,2.4542,0.8577,4.7876,3.3811,3.0436,0.3634,1.1872,0.4558,0.006,0.0029,0.0006,1.6239,1.6468,1.0623,4.5402,2.3039,2.6317,4.688,1.0201,0.1701,1.5084,3.7776,0.8835,0.0173,0.0025,0.001,2.3144,0.8157,0.1277,0.7864,1.689,3.6992,4.2349,0.4625,7.0363,3.4064,0.64,1.539,4.2878,1.627,4.4522,4.7912,6.1247,6.0249,2.3784,2.0705,2.7275,2.2862,5.7208,0.515,3.4231,6.0755,0.0026,1.7302,1.516,1.2862,2.2023,5.2709,2.9756,2.1708,2.2343,0.2159,5.7466,0.481,2.6332,4.7381,0.1265,1.0994,5.7009,1.3027,1.5201,1.4945,5.3208,2.7498,0.0451,2.0733,2.8321,1.8159,0.9158,2.0079,0.8208,1.9745,4.0339,1.4975,0.8024,2.6159,5.5863,0.5703,4.2067,1.9302,0.0266,0.0045,0.0025,0.001,5.0823,3.864,3.1391,1.6269,0.4315,0.1083,1.1446,2.3052,2.6989,1.7768,1.0575,4.5209,2.548,4.6384,1.8252,3.5005,3.0381,6.1557,1.4755,4.2376,3.3675,3.3188,3.099,2.7737,1.4077,2.3027,3.2754,5.2723,0.6837,0.9036,3.3267,0.9274,4.4228,0.7473]}
{"id":2746,"ended":true,"length":559,"gen_text":"St. Laurent was utterly confident of an election victory, so much so that he did not even bother to fill the sixteen vacancies in the Senate. He had been confident of re @realDonaldTrump's Senate majority in the year since he first appointed him, and now he had no shot of taking office unless he did everything right.\n\n\"I guess that's the time it takes to be a Republican,\" he told reporters.\n\nHe was right \u2014 and he wasn't afraid to make any noise.\n\n\"I believe what he's saying is correct. Because if it's true, the election was actually won by someone who was really wrong. But it was more than right. It was also a victory for me for my party,\" McConnell said, with a laugh. \"I know it may be long before we see a repeat of the things that Hillary Clinton did the same month, but I won this election because I wasn't a member of any one party, no matter how many times we had it, and there's so much more we can do to win.\"\n\nMcConnell also reiterated his support for Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., the former House conservative from North Carolina who was a member of Trump's team. Meadows, who was born in Virginia but raised in Arizona where Trump ran against GOP incumbents, has been pushing for Trump's ban on Muslims entering the U.S.\n\nMcConnell said he was encouraged by the fact that he is the only Republican on the Senate Homeland Security Committee who would hold an open session that included Meadows. He expressed amazement that Meadows had endorsed Trump when he introduced him at a GOP event in Washington, D.C. \"And he has made a big difference in the lives of people around the country. It's amazing how much I enjoyed my time here, and all the people I've talked to I've heard that my record is very high. No one's done more to make our country safer for American citizens by enacting policies that hurt the little guy instead of protecting the big company with its own agenda,\" McConnell said, shaking his head. \"So I think it's a big, big deal that I am one of those individuals, the only Republican on the Senate Committee, who will do what President Trump wants.\"\n\nThe vote comes as Trump faces growing criticism from Democrats for their failure to win control of the Senate in November. McConnell has yet to hold a meeting with senators after that, and his only chance of success is to deliver a victory speech at a rally next Friday.\n\nStill, despite some of his high level rhetoric, McConnell knows that the Senate must become more transparent if it is to win back control of the House of Representatives, which he said he will support.\n\n\"It's always important for every legislator to hold their hand up and have a big deal happen in the senate,\" he said.","token_len":586,"entropy":[2.3446,7.0288,4.5329,8.9659,7.5305,2.3182,5.8086,5.4837,1.1967,1.7073,4.9412,3.233,0.0254,0.0686,0.5917,5.12,0.3142,2.7641,1.3026,0.8152,6.2413,2.4181,11.933,4.6421,1.5696,0.599,4.3418,0.8211,2.1454,2.6701,2.5344,6.2198,1.441,5.8929,16.5924,2.9325,0.9081,5.4248,2.9299,2.7247,1.5177,5.3134,3.5736,1.6301,2.616,5.4894,0.8267,1.8116,1.1451,3.6796,0.7931,1.8129,3.5425,6.4846,1.5281,3.6385,3.4546,4.5798,0.6852,3.8659,4.0648,1.6008,0.5116,0.8309,0.0022,4.1202,1.6692,5.809,2.9736,0.6576,1.9703,5.9412,4.8974,0.4321,0.4373,2.6195,1.7287,2.4782,0.9995,0.8846,1.4095,2.3981,1.5434,1.4155,0.0002,3.2573,2.5146,1.8101,4.2725,2.0714,2.0182,3.8274,0.0004,4.6769,0.612,2.9272,5.9741,5.5382,1.3707,1.035,0.0002,2.241,0.9892,4.2058,4.5927,3.5761,1.1692,0.7085,0.5657,2.7945,1.9038,5.5604,2.5403,2.6583,1.1279,1.032,0.4874,3.6032,3.6842,3.1216,5.4222,2.6537,0.5972,3.8195,0.5016,1.8256,3.92,5.007,1.9419,3.6924,2.4778,1.5211,5.2764,1.5475,6.0027,1.2633,0.7731,0.1308,2.9622,1.9498,1.8803,0.6303,3.9398,5.4954,3.0759,1.59,1.1855,5.7149,0.5735,2.5078,4.7713,0.8768,1.6459,0.1346,1.2179,1.1235,4.0686,2.4005,4.3061,1.3441,6.0726,2.7284,1.6735,1.6722,1.169,5.4554,0.4436,1.5938,5.2064,1.0364,5.3047,0.2919,2.3304,5.7905,3.7005,5.235,2.3069,0.2635,0.8932,5.4777,3.343,0.7045,1.1708,0.833,5.5819,0.0005,2.9345,5.5002,0.0449,2.9395,3.1402,0.8755,2.8332,3.2953,0.1447,1.2782,1.6861,2.4328,2.914,3.1874,5.1306,3.0084,1.1048,5.3004,1.6975,4.9775,0.2667,0.8625,2.6947,0.3635,0.2813,1.3117,3.2574,2.1671,0.2287,0.0002,2.9267,0.0,3.447,5.478,0.6055,2.6904,0.1135,5.6447,0.0018,3.3706,0.1277,0.9645,0.4728,0.008,0.1458,0.0002,0.0017,0.0715,1.8299,2.9931,2.1974,4.3532,4.2717,0.2701,0.0063,0.849,2.3498,3.4845,2.5052,0.0042,1.4688,0.0067,3.7383,1.0157,2.4309,1.5861,0.6609,1.9425,3.5135,0.2981,3.0937,1.496,2.5974,0.1773,4.713,7.0068,1.0606,3.8037,3.6327,3.9505,1.5564,0.0072,0.6143,2.4163,1.4378,4.4865,0.9489,2.4856,1.3011,5.6099,0.0272,0.9529,0.1831,0.0056,0.9108,0.0003,0.0016,0.4243,1.3156,0.0001,2.6042,0.0001,1.8592,0.8753,2.0168,4.8355,0.2552,1.4878,2.1035,0.1027,3.3014,3.8501,2.4288,0.5003,0.9741,3.054,0.4793,2.2192,5.7339,0.0013,0.1292,1.3053,3.5578,5.744,3.1007,1.9325,3.6952,4.4693,3.8555,3.1584,0.8674,2.1156,5.8032,5.7819,0.0065,0.8654,2.2544,1.908,4.9183,0.21,3.4667,0.5605,5.7719,0.4979,2.7863,1.1892,3.9659,3.2722,1.0305,3.3627,1.501,0.2422,0.0003,0.0002,0.6268,3.1015,4.1437,2.4388,3.0483,4.1758,1.9257,2.9325,1.6642,1.4654,1.4015,1.8059,0.0395,2.0284,3.207,0.1249,0.1503,2.5072,2.3427,0.4722,2.981,2.439,1.6292,3.6167,4.7221,3.6654,0.3355,1.7449,2.485,0.7857,5.7327,1.3661,1.6255,1.8709,1.208,2.8542,0.0383,6.0988,0.6591,3.3584,3.8118,4.6056,4.5846,1.261,2.2141,3.5795,2.3144,5.8628,1.168,2.4522,3.4482,1.1735,0.8911,2.4143,3.154,0.139,1.7231,3.3353,3.19,1.2087,4.8133,4.8006,0.0032,3.8427,0.3366,3.6193,2.0755,5.6773,0.2821,4.9397,0.0229,2.47,0.5152,1.078,6.8629,6.9089,3.1763,2.9543,3.3576,0.7227,0.7037,0.1969,2.9225,5.4908,0.0245,0.0042,0.729,1.4354,3.1535,1.0583,1.3958,1.5311,0.2608,1.7563,3.214,3.9983,0.3217,2.0907,1.7985,1.9838,3.5938,4.1438,0.0415,1.5704,5.3832,3.4351,3.8961,1.3154,1.0912,0.8994,0.3459,0.7817,1.5716,1.1788,0.5163,2.6295,3.4456,2.2734,4.6104,0.118,3.4611,2.3529,0.1532,0.0002,2.6828,5.4933,4.3668,1.4864,1.3667,3.6019,3.6003,2.024,0.7709,2.5009,1.4815,3.666,2.9067,0.0269,4.7473,2.4519,0.0243,0.2612,1.0628,1.9542,2.0159,0.4266,3.5976,2.2566,5.229,0.0029,5.3873,0.4423,4.7615,0.18,4.5455,4.8985,5.0061,1.3329,1.0332,2.7621,4.2456,3.8003,1.0616,2.6546,1.4008,0.5821,5.0046,0.7848,3.6562,0.2233,2.4405,1.2673,2.1073,3.1484,3.6416,1.0906,1.0561,0.0002,5.1246,0.016,4.8853,4.4148,1.9484,1.464,5.5968,6.1551,2.4447,0.5752,0.8692,6.1394,0.8696,2.1961,3.0461,3.996,5.1589,0.9044,4.0503,5.8579,0.2536,0.6975,0.1633,2.3711,1.3381,1.1965,0.0999,0.1521,1.1653,2.174,0.0074,2.4912,1.3674,2.078,2.0071,1.6868,2.2526,3.3604,0.9407,0.7612,0.0002,0.2265,2.827,0.4625,4.5006,2.4872,1.4073,5.0631,5.9184,0.4798,5.7048,1.7167,5.1323,1.4931,0.7434,4.9253,1.1665,5.6289,6.0491,3.9011,2.5354,0.5791,6.0163,0.9474,0.8101,0.1489,0.2495]}
{"id":1321,"ended":false,"length":541,"gen_text":"From September 4 to 7, the remnants of a hurricane brought heavy rain to Southern California. The storm delivered over a year's worth of rainfall to Blythe, while Imperial received more rainfall than any other city in the state since 2010. But Blythe fell to its lowest level in nearly half a century on top of a previous record high for the Sierra Nevada. The storm brought as much as 10 feet of rain and caused widespread flooding and mudslides that left some 1,500 homeless during the early days of the storm.\n\nA man drives through a flooded Los Angeles river, November 6, 2016. Photo taken November 6, 2016.\n\nFor people who were swept away from their homes, the storm made for a good week: On top of last week's record rainfall, there were over 400 trees downed on L.A.'s Santa Monica neighborhood in the first five days, according to the National Weather Service. In recent weeks, Los Angeles has seen its number of severe flooding totals fall. It's also not clear how much rain has hit, but at least about three inches of rain fell during a seven-day period in March. The Southern California Department of Water Resources declared a dangerous category 5 severe drought on Wednesday, marking the fifth time in that span there was no rain on a record high since 1981.\n\nA woman walks along the streets of St. Paul, January 25, 2017.

On Saturday, the Florida Keys had experienced more widespread flooding and mudslides this week than it had in the seven-day period the NWS described as a seasonally adjusted record. The National Hurricane Center reported on Saturday that in the second half of 2017, an average of 4.5 inches of rain fell in St. Petersburg, with a third of that coming in the Palos Verdes Bay area.

{"id":4397,"ended":true,"length":545,"gen_text":"The Timothy Everest brand has three levels of tailoring.'Bespoke'is aimed at young professionals with the means to purchase bespoke tailoring, but not necessarily the desire to visit Savile Row, nor its iconic home in the West End of London, where the group lives, for fear of offending customers. ''I did feel sorry for those people who didn't get in,'' Andrew said. ''This wasn't about people with 'good skin' or wearing a baggy black suit. If anyone was offended by them using a baggy black suit, it's us.''\n\nThe brand sells three standard colours for $40, with the 'bitch' from the upper set of four and the 'chilly' from the lower set looking like black. ''I'm not trying to change what we wear for one or two occasions. I try to do more than what's in the style and what makes us successful,'' he said. ''But if people use them together or don't, that's what will get it, so there's always a problem.\" A few months ago, Savile Row said it would cut its workforce by 13% to allow for a \"better customer experience\", but there's not as much new talent, with one member of the group making a $100,000-a-year lifestyle.\n\n' Good skin'has been created by the two men, with the man himself saying, ''I did get 'cuckoo' in me once and I had no problem with my life'. The business is run by two former colleagues, a woman employed as a dress designer after three years in the industry, and one for a male staff member. ''We're an art business, if we give people a break, we're not going to let them down,'' he said. ''We believe that there's a better life for all in this business. People want something that's worth money and do it right. No one's getting away with it. People think there's no value in it. We don't want our work taken for granted, and it's been that way for some years.''\n\nAndrew could be seen in the footage wearing khakis and a black leather jacket at Savile Row's Notting Hill nightclub.\n\nThe charity was founded with generous donations from its founder and philanthropist, Sir Christopher Nicholls, but its initial funding came from the Conservative party and the BBC, who saw fit to award it a \u00a350,000 grant to pay its expenses and to help with the business. Savile Row has since taken two advertising spots, showing a man in white shrimping a baggy black suit, and the group's new studio building has been rented on the site by Savile Row's owners to record the band playing. The brand released a limited-edition mini jacket earlier this year, offering an authentic look that will appeal to a young generation.","token_len":587,"entropy":[12.246,12.9954,10.1185,2.7061,6.6367,5.6342,0.3795,8.9818,0.337,11.4155,8.9065,4.5682,0.026,3.5363,8.7372,7.3439,0.1795,3.8257,4.4227,2.4842,2.7676,5.3903,0.1964,6.5281,7.3149,0.0001,5.6919,0.2507,3.2016,3.6083,3.98,2.45,2.4555,5.9727,0.3432,8.0204,10.3332,1.0337,1.2688,2.2458,5.3764,4.2434,4.7857,5.3963,1.996,1.9641,3.5677,0.4818,2.9784,0.1828,2.0058,1.8657,1.5473,5.48,4.7086,2.5297,3.7581,1.9879,0.2862,2.2503,3.8975,0.377,6.5987,2.5102,5.3557,5.4297,5.0083,0.1847,3.2686,2.1988,0.7585,3.616,0.0009,2.938,4.077,1.1077,6.6529,1.5586,0.2525,0.6201,4.8127,4.2734,0.0004,1.8918,4.9546,5.0799,4.8367,4.6298,4.707,1.083,1.2359,5.2411,1.7983,5.2047,0.4501,3.749,1.8782,1.1583,4.7713,4.0761,2.4137,1.3583,1.1453,4.4952,6.5609,1.7227,2.4851,0.033,0.3129,0.1603,0.5749,1.1697,2.6956,3.7402,1.6448,3.6205,0.0011,2.0555,3.8274,6.0504,5.2162,5.7973,4.3962,2.9027,3.8715,4.0182,1.6034,2.4593,1.9312,3.7513,4.5283,4.9726,1.0376,5.9841,1.1835,5.4146,5.7853,3.835,3.7577,3.4034,0.6904,0.3563,3.6791,3.0741,0.3345,1.5907,0.1458,0.215,0.3674,6.813,1.8685,4.8669,1.6545,1.7072,2.229,2.5572,1.3096,3.2936,0.0117,4.9339,3.9449,1.903,2.9977,4.2442,5.4417,3.2183,0.1467,4.1384,2.1571,0.8403,4.2509,0.2145,3.3584,4.1037,1.5008,2.7313,1.8868,2.2829,0.8321,3.719,3.0745,2.3105,4.4335,1.5365,4.4124,0.9307,2.0643,0.2519,0.0789,0.6521,3.0082,2.2522,3.2244,5.4811,4.6909,6.2367,3.481,4.2729,0.0019,2.3175,2.8929,0.4389,2.5382,4.1959,2.7153,5.2259,5.4438,2.5391,3.834,0.5479,3.015,1.7256,5.2008,3.2726,4.9382,4.4174,3.1149,0.2761,0.5698,1.8941,0.0016,0.0195,4.123,0.5514,1.0087,4.3902,1.6436,5.1213,0.6121,5.0946,2.5206,1.9392,5.2181,1.2625,1.8348,3.4366,3.5056,3.5277,0.1947,2.4754,1.1795,4.5535,3.014,3.8988,5.1911,0.2115,5.2172,2.2308,3.6189,2.7603,4.2218,5.2235,1.0008,1.6464,1.8194,4.4683,2.3242,2.7228,2.8337,0.2232,0.0033,2.2452,0.1567,0.0016,0.2481,5.583,2.3664,1.4096,0.0005,4.1823,12.0723,1.8001,1.5799,8.8325,1.6959,5.6751,1.2941,2.5327,5.6904,2.1537,1.8932,2.9218,1.8044,5.1521,4.5298,2.8043,3.192,0.5665,1.1324,5.3813,2.9336,6.0381,6.0196,4.8403,0.7987,1.4507,1.921,4.4294,4.018,2.4822,1.2687,4.5806,2.2108,1.8459,1.1257,5.1525,5.9301,5.0972,2.7926,5.4687,1.8461,3.1092,0.2386,2.578,4.5775,3.4355,1.019,3.8227,4.0624,6.7092,2.0078,0.377,5.0074,2.3447,5.948,6.0238,0.371,2.2484,0.8335,3.2433,0.6792,0.1966,3.6153,5.7528,2.3887,5.2604,5.3637,0.3507,0.5509,1.4709,1.5601,1.825,4.9425,5.2716,4.3931,1.2602,5.7685,2.0285,5.3842,1.2192,1.4317,5.5418,0.9411,1.8051,1.6588,1.9789,0.7618,0.0711,3.6792,0.2957,1.9249,0.8329,1.3441,0.1521,0.0789,0.6804,1.2677,4.8548,1.5923,3.9093,0.9468,1.1026,3.7222,3.5766,0.9974,2.8469,4.5695,1.5976,2.2047,1.1942,3.8636,2.7863,3.7501,1.7825,1.1383,5.4066,3.7108,1.751,5.3588,1.2449,3.4199,0.9531,5.5958,0.8928,2.4629,3.811,3.8347,0.1627,1.0707,1.0955,3.6133,3.7807,3.931,0.2224,1.6723,2.5222,0.376,2.5056,1.0669,2.0935,2.6708,0.0004,1.8102,4.2526,4.0913,5.2215,2.3724,0.1811,2.4878,1.9207,2.6699,0.423,4.4748,2.7673,0.0152,0.4823,3.5048,2.9401,0.9851,1.1185,0.0004,2.4028,6.7582,3.3475,0.8346,2.7242,0.9757,5.5905,2.6577,6.5296,1.0043,0.7537,0.8644,2.0957,4.1127,0.3879,4.1937,1.0458,0.0008,0.0062,1.3459,6.015,0.0029,3.6236,1.9968,3.0366,0.0004,2.2916,5.7269,4.373,1.1772,5.0516,6.5259,0.9321,0.3256,3.5319,3.2459,2.4483,5.1374,0.0972,1.3515,3.0859,4.5922,5.6439,0.0428,0.4506,3.9282,2.8077,5.4789,3.1132,1.235,0.1937,1.6589,5.6951,1.7718,1.9268,1.9329,5.6674,1.3525,3.3957,5.4523,4.0667,0.0183,5.3075,1.8713,1.2261,2.3743,2.7354,0.0739,0.0032,1.2883,2.4388,4.8417,3.2067,2.3016,2.9614,2.6294,2.9636,2.4026,1.7175,5.3206,0.8511,2.6885,0.0022,0.0042,1.9047,2.3731,4.115,5.5746,5.3959,3.275,2.1596,5.8566,1.7702,2.2588,2.1315,5.0425,5.7031,4.0623,0.662,2.5379,3.8575,0.3008,0.7443,0.4422,1.7675,1.3424,2.9349,3.5758,1.3066,3.4574,4.7492,3.0213,3.9006,0.7295,4.9543,4.6935,1.1649,2.7543,2.1293,3.2432,0.0041,0.0504,1.0406,4.7803,4.9575,3.929,2.3027,4.0155,2.8119,2.4929,2.5175,4.9507,5.5207,0.9164,5.383,1.3716,0.0296,5.4831,5.5215,4.4057,0.0406,0.2451,0.9873,5.6847,3.1365,5.197,1.8812,3.877,2.9533,1.9791,0.0926,2.8979,4.2569,2.6206,1.7643]}
{"id":944,"ended":false,"length":538,"gen_text":"Starting in 1933, M @ - @ 5 was used as the designation along a section of highway that was previously part of US 2 in Mackinac and Chippewa counties in the Upper Peninsula, where it has become more pronounced. The highway was named Mackinac by Robert S. McClellan in 1781. It was designated for the city of Lacey in 1762, a part of the city that had been part of the original Mackinac County highway before 1842 and is located today.\n\nIt is a very high grade section where highways are located that can easily pass between the United States mountains and some mountainous mountains. The sections are so short that people who can pass the sections can carry a light or a heavy loaded pistol or light.45 with them. A few of the sections may be long because of the terrain and conditions, making cross sections difficult to cross. Some cross-section sections are longer than other portions, but it is necessary to realize that it is important to find the right crossing, so there are many reasons why you may need to cross a section.\n\nIf you see any confusion in the name, or are concerned about driving on unsafe and unsafe terrain, call the highway safety hotline at 878-232-1175.\n\nThe most common reason traffic tickets are issued for unsafe and unsafe driving in M: 5 are for driving on unsafe, dangerous, and dangerous grades.\n\nIf you are driving unsafely, go to your local parking area, or use a short but convenient alternative such as parking meter. They could provide parking as they find it convenient. The parking meter can be done to a different location, and it is less intrusive compared to parking in your driveway or office building.\n\nIf using light trucks you are not looking for parking, I suggest visiting your local U.S. Department of Transportation Parking Bureau. They're not located near many of the other national highways. They are near a lot of parks and roads so there is not much to go through. If it is too late to get back to your vehicle, you are free to go back to any other places that meet your needs. If you want help with any questions, use one of the toll booths on your roadside.\n\nM: 5 will help you find directions to any area on your road, and also allow you to see the signs for your area. There is a list of local locations below, all of which have the M\/P sign over their respective roadways.\n\nIf you are unable to find a designated road with enough of an area to help you, you can use this information to contact the county where you live.

{"id":2135,"ended":true,"length":561,"gen_text":"The effect of Busch's illustrations are enhanced by his forthright verse, with taunts, derision, ironic twists, exaggeration, ambiguity and startling rhymes. His language had an influence on the English speaker's own language in the way that those of us who followed English grammar generally understood English.\n\nWith all due respect, Busch is the only English-speaking speaker anywhere in the world capable of conveying such an idea. But the original meaning was not quite ready before his arrival and thus Busch had to go back to the drawing board, and this is where I begin. Busch has no problem with translating this notion into Chinese. The expression \"you must understand\", which he uses to emphasize that he is talking about a simple matter, is a simple phrase with a simple meaning. Yet in his own use of it, he uses what appears to be a form of ambiguity, i.e., what some translators call an \"implicit\" use of the word, rather than the full meaning. He does, however, not completely change the meaning of the phrase. Instead, he uses his very use as his sole use as a literal source for a line of English which is not so much not clear on its own, like the English language, but in a way that is very vague, often using phrases where they might even be used in a different context which is not clear in the context of the words themselves.\n\nBusch's way of speaking conveys this fact: he is talking about the common idea of what a thing means in Chinese. Yet even that isn't clear in the context of that phrase. What is clear to him is that it is not clear in the context of the phrase if it is, then as a general term, not clear on its own, as in this case. It is at least clear that the idea of a common idea which appears in Chinese as something that may be understood, may be understood in a different context, i.e., for different purposes (eg. as a teaching language).\n\nWhile this is certainly one of the most important points, this is an extremely vague one. What I would have said about this, what I would have said to my translator if something was wrong with it did not affect its context in any way. So again, even as you would not be able to tell exactly what his intention was is in one place, the sense that he is dealing with his audience simply has the same sort of meaning as if it had been in any kind of context of Chinese. As a result, with enough of my translation, I would say that it is not clear to me that the actual translation by Busch is one in which that particular phrase really is a thing, simply because he appears so vague.\n\nI hope to update this article more often as we delve deeper into the topic of the meanings of words in Chinese.","token_len":587,"entropy":[8.2348,0.692,12.5326,1.2241,1.4361,10.3905,4.795,8.1403,0.3459,2.4779,10.6261,0.0175,8.9599,1.4592,4.366,7.906,2.6279,2.7445,6.3666,1.0712,0.7206,9.0592,5.3982,0.9414,8.974,0.7457,7.8786,1.2994,7.4293,8.5921,0.0062,0.4562,3.0189,6.6734,8.2394,3.0745,5.1889,0.2399,1.8651,5.3696,4.6229,1.7293,3.9344,3.2618,4.3371,1.6133,4.9544,1.6547,6.2132,1.2916,0.7988,0.5766,5.5966,2.7546,2.2622,4.8317,2.2875,1.9141,0.7001,1.36,0.0043,5.3027,3.919,2.2645,0.0543,1.2668,1.1225,0.0009,2.3519,3.7944,2.8881,2.2201,3.044,0.5521,2.1697,6.8935,1.4816,0.2499,0.1509,5.1641,0.0041,4.4687,0.0009,2.0418,2.0646,4.3132,0.6684,2.568,2.8475,5.8713,2.4898,3.7681,1.907,4.2502,6.5161,6.6898,2.6983,4.1358,3.7486,5.5152,2.5665,0.001,3.6591,0.215,4.0978,1.5005,0.722,2.0568,0.7864,0.0403,2.6476,2.5304,3.8433,1.6976,1.3024,3.2933,4.4501,1.2824,4.0541,0.0008,3.6031,4.2465,4.0332,1.0041,5.7202,4.8522,5.7075,0.9995,5.4326,0.9052,2.8467,5.5468,0.8003,5.4332,3.3155,3.4414,4.9259,2.2001,2.4106,1.1795,1.382,4.3445,2.2547,1.1728,1.3085,4.6911,0.5898,2.1667,5.1701,2.5519,0.5752,0.8932,2.2116,3.6042,3.991,3.6546,1.4637,2.4786,0.8409,0.6781,5.1578,3.2114,2.1818,2.818,5.6937,0.1958,2.8893,0.4251,1.2591,2.7777,5.2796,3.9148,0.168,0.0976,0.9021,5.2482,0.1778,4.882,1.5402,5.5828,0.0013,0.0004,0.4555,4.7034,5.2931,4.5111,0.001,1.0792,2.942,0.7416,4.2467,0.6215,2.1707,4.6426,0.4418,1.031,0.8603,2.2657,2.7839,0.0082,2.2754,4.3412,0.8765,1.4145,3.0478,2.7532,3.3096,0.2413,0.0023,4.589,5.4256,4.6554,0.6549,0.3875,0.6057,0.5751,2.0468,1.3039,3.0088,0.3479,0.2545,1.8313,4.1261,5.7047,4.8133,2.6981,4.4052,4.6752,4.7902,2.5324,1.0139,5.4556,4.8503,1.8592,3.2752,5.581,1.1527,4.1709,3.8985,1.8439,2.1278,4.8375,2.1333,5.9545,2.9369,4.7116,0.8552,1.1618,1.2317,7.4108,1.5483,3.3912,2.5808,0.8246,0.2127,3.4355,1.8414,1.3176,1.1156,1.4725,3.3483,5.8089,1.7636,5.1535,4.415,4.522,6.1527,3.256,4.0938,5.0814,0.5604,2.6361,1.6788,1.5022,2.8257,1.3878,6.3956,1.5748,1.0013,1.7948,2.8837,0.8397,1.8987,0.5778,0.6045,3.3323,1.8364,0.2534,0.9714,0.0002,3.4145,0.0008,1.0531,5.5437,0.217,2.9021,4.8313,0.0006,2.6603,5.2252,3.7626,2.394,1.6206,2.3225,0.1441,2.2877,4.967,4.7266,0.6616,3.172,1.9768,5.8128,2.8899,2.3515,1.3014,0.8463,4.5894,3.948,4.5869,5.1211,0.0004,2.0704,1.3779,0.9148,0.3651,0.261,4.9329,2.479,0.7882,3.3286,1.2413,0.1499,3.4197,1.5844,0.3197,0.3435,2.4029,0.7726,1.5693,1.4689,1.3382,0.6425,0.1832,0.2678,0.848,2.4027,5.4307,1.2384,0.9102,4.9949,6.1726,5.7019,1.4904,3.4902,4.0697,0.5334,2.0099,1.1734,2.9475,0.3299,0.0232,1.7757,2.7674,1.8987,3.9966,0.5658,0.6931,2.8722,0.6108,5.7974,1.5142,0.8884,1.4635,1.869,3.7028,0.4542,1.6941,2.7087,2.2402,4.7041,5.2084,1.1221,2.0239,3.0382,3.3348,1.8905,4.1692,1.1549,1.992,2.7929,4.0059,0.97,1.1354,1.2242,1.6501,1.0676,0.307,0.942,4.5832,0.0009,0.0006,0.0733,5.6524,3.0569,1.8632,4.4873,5.6023,0.8133,2.2098,0.5843,5.944,4.8117,1.5567,1.5918,0.0002,5.0749,2.1173,1.4174,2.4895,4.5888,0.6705,0.1503,1.4293,1.5953,1.2463,2.474,3.8212,1.2301,3.8975,3.4251,5.1423,3.8341,0.5263,3.0115,3.1551,2.3695,4.2843,2.908,2.2702,1.6124,3.468,5.7835,0.673,0.62,0.2363,0.7902,3.6179,3.6506,5.1362,3.2974,7.1788,2.126,3.7082,1.2904,2.417,6.8506,0.0395,4.643,6.2761,5.1933,2.2914,1.0857,0.1419,0.6473,3.6702,5.5339,0.2333,4.7716,3.8435,4.879,2.5199,2.8374,1.9419,0.3508,0.0206,2.4882,3.8299,0.2326,4.7118,3.3407,0.3826,5.9197,1.9603,5.933,4.0788,0.649,2.9494,4.9134,1.9571,0.9403,0.8154,5.5772,0.0825,4.7176,3.3383,5.2788,4.0855,3.0607,1.4035,6.1111,0.0009,1.1358,0.9547,2.8936,1.2732,2.6751,0.5809,2.4777,4.346,6.3344,0.0031,1.482,3.7631,3.3756,0.5847,3.9855,1.8023,1.696,0.2127,5.5397,6.2502,3.7925,3.5876,3.2843,1.0865,0.9032,1.9223,2.3473,0.3646,2.2792,0.6047,1.9728,0.5456,1.7936,0.1134,1.6482,2.0132,5.5292,3.8886,5.0138,0.4874,0.0018,1.2936,4.5515,2.1307,0.0561,4.3581,3.9934,2.058,4.5321,1.2632,2.3961,5.3073,2.0758,6.0751,0.3292,2.0816,6.0703,3.8509,3.3107,1.3064,0.9339,0.0002,2.8046,3.3152,3.5477,5.4471,0.3047,2.3081,5.439,2.7356,1.3838,3.262,5.1132,0.7885,0.0807,1.0707,3.4618,0.6997,2.1089,3.8596,0.2674,1.774,0.8452,0.4838,0.3876]}

The collection was destroyed when a fire of more than 8,000 flammable liquid vaporites spilled over the walls, causing a massive fireball that burst from the fire and engulfed many of them in flames.","token_len":587,"entropy":[12.1672,3.411,0.3947,6.0435,1.4417,5.4572,0.4088,2.4992,1.0316,0.3114,7.7885,4.5414,5.2523,9.7864,2.2858,7.5336,0.0429,3.9607,0.9928,3.4654,7.9017,0.4287,10.9698,3.9035,4.6884,0.0647,1.1652,1.5384,6.4186,12.5693,7.1957,5.7993,11.6058,6.0637,4.3494,2.776,3.22,1.7748,5.6003,6.2292,0.0079,3.1861,5.1535,0.691,3.5093,1.6219,1.463,3.5248,4.9164,0.7451,1.4316,3.3087,3.3741,1.9755,1.6225,0.0809,1.514,4.5194,2.4329,3.4556,1.5263,4.9323,4.073,0.6056,4.0096,2.2399,0.8525,0.8141,1.6283,4.6874,0.4133,4.6608,0.0016,4.0544,5.2602,5.2741,0.0722,3.038,3.7192,0.4734,2.9249,2.8038,3.0054,5.6763,2.786,1.8695,0.2992,3.45,3.4842,0.4416,0.4212,3.6754,0.2755,3.0865,0.1832,1.9636,1.7033,1.0811,1.7493,1.6643,0.7928,1.7097,1.0605,1.5929,1.558,0.0002,3.2418,5.4604,4.2639,4.7895,1.2101,1.4472,2.9351,0.7412,0.9302,1.4498,5.5024,2.69,3.6017,6.4642,2.8099,3.1024,3.112,2.443,3.1085,5.2184,1.9188,1.8818,4.0766,1.0886,4.3785,1.2318,4.5217,1.0065,5.1589,0.558,0.9568,0.3278,2.8036,2.8011,2.0513,4.7687,0.0424,4.1366,0.0234,0.7959,1.2547,1.9691,2.8189,2.0902,2.0102,2.1396,1.2681,0.0988,4.3435,0.5813,0.4514,2.0005,7.2584,4.5101,4.6703,5.1646,0.5247,4.9131,0.0179,0.4351,1.755,1.3765,1.4434,0.3648,0.8152,0.0002,10.2035,1.6578,0.6263,0.012,0.0099,0.0499,0.0428,0.0039,0.0165,0.0007,0.0038,0.0041,0.0347,0.0014,0.0558,0.0015,0.0008,0.0008,0.0381,0.0036,0.001,0.0055,0.0008,0.0071,0.0002,0.0008,0.0113,0.0009,0.0048,0.0018,0.0015,0.0009,0.0035,0.002,0.0015,0.0005,0.0011,0.0124,0.0234,0.0003,0.0003,0.0015,0.0015,0.0007,0.0005,0.0006,0.002,0.0016,0.013,0.0004,2.9883,1.9601,4.7365,0.697,2.4069,6.2857,0.1106,0.2938,2.374,1.8428,4.704,3.4363,2.6243,1.6059,1.2322,5.5545,4.9734,3.2276,5.4428,4.4349,0.0879,2.0939,3.4358,0.5499,0.8798,4.0614,1.259,5.3283,4.1069,0.3009,2.8576,2.8129,0.3579,3.7964,0.7958,2.8175,0.6278,0.5102,1.9864,1.9693,1.1583,0.7387,0.0001,2.4368,4.219,4.5345,0.612,1.033,6.0856,4.1589,0.5123,4.9895,3.2998,0.3509,5.0493,0.9757,2.3097,0.0204,2.6053,0.4444,2.2832,0.5788,3.6093,0.5064,3.6236,1.0397,1.3333,2.9801,0.1447,3.4134,5.9345,1.5017,2.3988,1.8432,2.1128,2.6443,0.2149,2.4934,1.2011,5.616,0.5387,1.3497,0.0001,1.8174,4.8855,1.516,0.6201,7.4358,4.3155,3.3767,0.0206,2.0732,0.4412,4.2334,5.9401,4.7922,1.2992,4.5423,4.1304,1.3597,5.0924,3.8489,2.5524,6.8553,0.9912,1.8027,1.745,2.2251,4.7968,2.0634,4.9713,3.3195,1.0208,4.0711,2.6025,2.0779,2.9569,1.762,1.6631,4.7455,4.5963,0.1449,0.99,0.0001,1.3937,5.8573,2.0903,4.3892,5.0094,0.5205,0.5775,4.3023,1.8921,0.3131,2.0245,0.1099,0.144,4.9627,0.6133,4.5418,0.4955,1.92,0.1362,0.1633,6.0643,5.5022,3.076,4.5238,1.849,4.3626,3.6203,3.5106,0.5453,3.5706,3.0341,1.3905,0.0185,0.3207,0.8323,0.0394,1.1257,0.0949,0.0061,0.4708,1.0646,1.5566,0.6528,3.0452,0.5523,3.4561,0.2853,0.0607,0.7768,1.005,4.847,0.2069,1.2172,0.2891,0.1038,0.2831,3.8135,1.6831,5.5968,1.2543,1.3654,0.8016,0.0001,1.5735,2.7911,0.4192,1.3947,1.6536,0.2181,3.629,0.2354,0.1775,1.3797,1.0332,4.8795,0.0738,5.3203,5.1606,1.9196,3.7341,1.2724,5.2544,4.377,4.7288,0.0128,2.0716,1.8095,6.1115,3.2675,3.9344,0.1747,4.9271,1.3025,3.4949,2.5007,5.8173,0.8328,5.2539,0.4656,0.3319,0.4049,0.3508,1.8341,1.3458,6.0018,4.478,0.3698,0.6206,1.5633,1.3574,5.4269,3.7321,3.3854,0.2145,3.5759,0.5865,0.7843,0.0001,4.0874,4.8207,3.034,2.3451,2.1269,2.9086,1.8968,1.0229,5.561,3.2633,1.5922,4.8696,1.1494,0.5367,5.3725,2.004,0.6019,0.1496,0.517,0.6146,4.2744,0.8379,0.5771,3.5176,1.7944,0.6346,0.0014,0.0055,3.931,4.1939,3.8282,1.5219,3.8165,3.5786,0.2374,0.1553,0.6046,1.5678,4.0227,1.269,0.2836,3.2618,2.3231,4.7178,0.0476,1.2951,4.9675,4.3981,4.0224,4.9914,4.0429,1.5321,0.4361,0.8545,0.0002,6.0283,1.3237,3.3099,2.9346,0.0022,3.0068,1.3858,0.7919,0.8787,4.0512,0.0013,1.3745,2.702,3.2277,0.6123,4.9177,2.3102,1.345,3.3218,4.6818,4.9108,1.5392,3.5405,4.6748,0.3453,0.651,1.6675,1.2356,2.2401,5.2702,2.9285,2.4274,2.3322,5.2994,5.57,0.0149,4.4605,0.3482,0.0586,6.0603,0.3616,0.0364,2.6306,4.8033,5.9166,5.2246,1.9361,0.424,2.7676,3.1201,2.1077,2.4029,2.1596,3.9086,1.5666,5.2814,1.9972,0.3256,3.1322,1.8577,2.9156,3.6562,1.0044,3.9419,2.6995,0.5395,0.344]}

There were eight others arrested: two on suspicion of attempting to murder and one on another charge of attempting to commit murder.\n\nA former member of the British police who has since been released and is appealing the case, said, \"It's completely a surprise and the charges against him have been proven against him. It takes away a lot of credibility, the seriousness with which he is held. He will lose credibility as a suspect. He is now being held without bail\".\n\nDutkiewicz's father, who asked not to give his name to avoid further speculation which may have caused the case to move into the public spotlight, said \" 'Swansea' was not an appropriate way for his son to die due to the risk of exposure to blood running into his body that could be fatal. Even after three suicide attempts and seven arrests this year, it is still a tragedy that his brother continues to survive in such circumstances.\"\n\nAn inquest by a panel of three former police officers in 2007 found the case should have been dropped. One of the jury members in the trial was the then Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Michael Broadbent. The police's head of inquiry, John Whittingdale, agreed the case was over.\n\nHowever, after a number of complaints, including with the Chief Constable last year, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said that Dutkiewicz had not adequately responded to calls for him to be transferred to Southwark's SSE in time for the court appearances scheduled for next month.\n\nDutkiewicz's friends said their son had only been in detention for a few short hours before his death, on the advice of his lawyers, and had now been taken to court over his death.\n\nDutkiewicz was an academic at Oxford University who had a BA in international relations from Oxford University Press before his death.\n\nHis family said that his brother had been a dedicated supporter, and he acted freely throughout the trial.\n\nHe was born on Aug 27, 1959 in Pontefract, Lancashire, in Hampshire.","token_len":588,"entropy":[11.1401,9.0126,3.0672,12.4532,2.7114,12.619,4.1726,1.7682,9.1076,0.2678,2.3797,4.2733,5.1268,1.481,5.095,3.6964,2.5637,10.8606,7.9708,6.8795,7.7877,6.37,5.6452,0.065,2.1711,2.2443,1.5938,7.628,0.1243,4.1056,1.595,2.1231,4.7523,7.7645,0.2042,0.5513,5.3879,3.9375,3.3268,0.4023,2.4779,8.6144,3.8639,3.7186,0.289,2.3794,4.4628,3.674,2.3545,4.6383,0.0256,0.0104,0.0004,2.607,5.2786,5.4666,0.0346,3.7203,0.0014,0.0099,2.123,3.9717,1.2165,1.8267,3.4173,1.7626,0.2216,3.5667,0.2916,0.7599,1.7071,0.0009,10.8379,5.6702,0.0758,0.0278,0.0518,0.0007,0.0017,6.2852,1.3226,0.0283,0.0015,0.0126,0.0033,0.0104,0.0027,0.0071,5.2531,0.015,0.0602,0.2686,9.429,5.0216,0.7205,3.0086,5.1862,3.3713,0.7705,2.4143,3.9086,2.1167,2.228,7.2829,5.0792,2.3718,5.7482,0.0148,4.2108,1.7411,1.8198,7.1003,2.7732,1.8154,2.2303,0.0147,0.0083,0.0007,2.9358,4.2893,0.9444,0.0023,0.0161,0.0007,0.5054,0.8374,0.7154,0.0002,3.6074,1.114,0.0058,0.0142,0.0109,0.0038,0.0008,0.0039,0.0029,0.0473,0.0047,0.0102,0.0052,0.0047,0.0276,0.0025,0.0065,0.0015,0.0121,0.0036,0.0046,0.0012,0.1403,0.0005,0.0015,0.0007,0.001,0.0063,0.0026,0.0004,0.001,0.0005,0.0067,0.002,5.8658,1.5359,5.2991,3.1458,1.304,5.4454,3.8151,3.5617,1.425,0.0092,3.7972,0.7869,1.3704,1.7641,0.851,1.1131,5.9059,0.6321,0.2947,2.5289,0.1384,1.8853,0.6707,0.3826,0.5104,0.0003,3.8939,4.5139,3.0702,0.0159,0.6029,4.8997,3.9371,3.0049,2.8468,2.9289,1.5954,1.9875,4.1035,1.5471,5.6098,1.8848,2.7995,1.2013,1.2549,4.7426,0.4507,2.1052,1.1085,5.5731,4.3903,4.8365,3.5558,4.2245,5.2287,1.0359,2.1704,2.7215,0.8977,4.6086,4.3465,0.4678,0.9662,2.194,6.4022,3.2599,2.3825,0.4162,0.2563,3.4087,3.0625,3.735,4.6228,3.0571,0.0235,0.8346,1.8392,3.2758,2.0558,2.0817,3.6261,4.9738,3.3737,2.5683,0.609,3.6793,2.056,1.8224,1.779,3.1157,3.0273,1.7313,2.964,1.4064,5.3371,0.2227,0.0003,2.959,0.0783,0.0144,0.001,2.0156,4.6134,0.9454,3.531,4.763,0.4401,0.0026,5.5657,0.2732,0.7116,2.5954,3.9199,3.9155,4.3604,7.6998,2.0665,0.4921,3.1952,1.7183,2.6691,0.0728,3.1354,3.4581,1.3264,2.2331,2.3122,0.1883,0.6639,5.1878,9.5193,2.0387,0.023,0.0012,0.1436,1.4179,3.1196,3.1331,4.426,4.2544,1.6831,3.1304,1.5438,0.2459,4.5251,6.4111,0.0071,1.5792,4.7259,0.6372,4.9614,0.8015,4.6896,6.07,3.1291,0.5929,2.0742,5.939,1.7173,2.3467,1.0921,0.874,6.2628,3.3453,4.4005,6.4296,0.1324,2.4337,3.8818,3.8379,4.1713,1.0526,0.5152,2.6946,1.2754,1.318,1.7162,2.5352,1.8094,2.3676,4.2815,5.8332,0.0432,5.4648,3.0781,2.9056,2.7927,1.3165,0.2624,0.0003,5.1405,1.4794,5.5541,2.6543,3.8973,0.3031,3.4913,2.443,1.6004,0.2379,3.0415,3.7182,0.8666,2.4749,3.3879,4.6401,1.1184,0.1816,1.9107,1.7649,5.773,0.9859,0.443,4.1019,1.462,4.3096,0.6804,2.1118,2.6865,3.6264,3.4392,3.8384,0.2843,1.7781,1.2965,1.8671,2.7993,5.5472,0.5152,1.1107,2.4089,4.5367,3.256,5.6356,0.3397,3.7205,0.361,4.2845,5.1701,0.5646,0.0849,0.1603,5.4966,2.5381,0.7398,1.8732,4.4194,1.5476,0.662,0.0004,3.2669,0.2283,3.6202,2.1099,3.5525,0.0023,4.5254,1.8315,2.6979,6.4899,0.8204,5.8459,0.3619,6.9702,0.4462,0.1973,1.0403,4.9276,0.4582,0.0664,0.0007,0.01,0.9752,0.056,0.027,0.0838,3.3935,2.994,3.5058,0.0032,0.0059,0.0012,1.8863,2.0096,5.155,3.7538,0.1924,3.6731,1.0702,1.8194,0.035,0.3079,3.7791,0.4248,5.2659,1.2244,3.3919,5.2761,3.0616,3.8289,5.1565,0.4846,0.7516,4.8642,7.1312,3.7419,0.2863,2.9264,0.9678,0.116,0.4995,0.0003,2.1901,0.0132,0.0048,0.0015,1.1185,6.0507,2.1171,4.2297,0.6816,1.141,5.342,1.2219,2.5044,5.1448,0.5496,1.6348,1.1923,5.1024,2.1224,2.2272,1.7805,2.6219,1.7051,5.2216,2.0552,2.5048,0.0216,0.8123,3.2759,1.1992,1.4602,1.4414,5.7855,1.1713,3.269,0.4316,2.3064,3.9513,1.8819,1.9599,0.5666,0.5269,0.0003,2.2355,0.0476,0.0046,0.0034,2.5169,4.397,5.4325,1.325,2.7457,0.388,2.5846,1.205,3.4667,3.5558,0.1779,4.0393,1.0011,1.1746,2.1144,0.2518,2.462,3.8845,2.7598,2.0977,0.7224,1.1728,0.0003,2.4405,2.3551,1.4334,2.815,2.648,3.45,0.9644,1.2913,1.9133,4.4599,3.2018,4.3687,1.8971,3.6084,6.4613,5.0622,3.7723,1.7312,1.4347,0.7013,0.4784,0.0003,2.665,1.0662,4.163,1.9484,6.1701,4.0423,0.2113,4.4693,1.0446,5.108,2.3618,0.1262,0.0007,0.3711,4.2759,0.0132,0.0,0.2944,2.3279,5.1288,0.8314]}

{"id":4801,"ended":true,"length":523,"gen_text":"In 1525, after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s led an expedition to Honduras over land, cutting across the Itza kingdom in what is now the northern Pet\u00e9n Department, where he founded the Aztec City Corporation.\nItza Culture\nDuring the First World War, with the support of powerful American colonists and supported by the Mexican king, in the late 1940s Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s decided to build a new empire. By 1941, Cort\u00e9s was leading and leading the new republic.\nHe created a strong and powerful army with a formidable capital that consisted of 12 million soldiers and four new cavalry divisions that were equipped with rifles and cannons (for defense of the capital). This infantry division fielded infantry officers but had only 500 artillery pieces.\nBy 1945, the army had increased to 250,000 members.\nWith the United States under pressure during the Spanish Civil War and military tensions growing, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s gave a massive new empire to Mexico City and later led the country's largest army, the Aztec Army, until 1954.\nThereafter, Mexican government agencies attempted to use the newly created government as a bargaining chip for Mexico.\nSar\u00e1na was attacked from the top and was forced to flee to Mexico.\nAftermath\nIn 1964, after his father died, the Spanish government established the Aztec Government of Aztec (a new government with only twelve former president, five military personnel, and four civilians working in the service of God ), with military personnel and civilian administration.\nMoz\u00fal\u00ed, who held a position of power in Aztec politics after that of king, was assassinated during a coup-plot and Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s was assassinated in 1961 after he died in a suicide attempt.\nIn 1976, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s died of poison poisoning after his troops fell into the hands of a Spanish guerilla band of bandits. Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s then took over Aztec government.\nIt is unknown what purpose this new government will play in the Mexican history.\nTo quote Spanish historian Robert Balesen : \"With the people still in good health, people still in peace, the people want their own government. We are at a crossroads when the Aztecs and Mexicans will have a common future \".\nI also do not wish to suggest that the Aztecs and Mexicans were just any good people. There is absolutely no such thing as good living in this world, the world we live in today. They had many many many many more than they had before, and the land they conquered, and the people who would live here today, had many many many many many many more then.\nIn short, when this nation would die and we would have a new government again, it would be like the end of a revolution, all of these revolutions ended when the Aztec Nation moved south where they were now.","token_len":589,"entropy":[7.7691,4.8859,0.3404,4.5828,1.5864,5.2276,1.8324,0.4063,1.5912,5.426,0.8294,2.3507,0.2214,6.8842,3.2878,1.346,1.4957,0.8417,5.3623,2.2795,0.5609,0.6296,6.83,7.479,5.048,2.3141,8.2315,4.0569,0.707,10.344,7.1817,8.7218,2.3169,3.8886,1.2564,0.2809,1.9186,4.6585,11.2963,1.3594,9.6911,1.9823,2.1578,0.9088,3.7234,0.63,4.268,0.2321,4.7999,6.1683,0.5831,1.6588,10.3297,2.3739,5.6909,1.3752,4.8129,0.6707,4.6166,0.8113,0.0005,0.232,5.5802,0.773,4.1502,0.0155,6.4765,4.4816,3.7932,2.5276,5.5638,0.1388,1.1521,2.1544,6.0395,0.6483,6.0772,1.9501,2.562,2.2677,0.1566,2.4111,0.0126,0.0073,0.1107,0.0107,4.3478,0.1489,2.7295,0.6333,1.8165,3.1824,1.9682,4.0812,2.8444,0.3961,4.552,0.0368,1.7921,4.3965,6.5934,4.6864,1.3357,3.2726,6.0038,1.9487,1.8492,3.0991,4.0401,1.16,4.7362,2.7925,2.2697,2.0722,3.7907,2.0893,4.3847,5.9606,3.6323,4.3348,0.2136,5.1086,3.9788,1.7227,1.5064,5.1575,6.5137,5.9603,1.4522,3.8159,1.7553,3.4546,0.2168,4.5342,0.8856,2.8134,4.971,4.6729,5.7738,1.4826,0.6318,1.7445,0.7075,3.4757,6.1616,2.105,6.3557,5.1651,3.4989,5.5718,3.101,2.7212,4.7631,5.272,1.4711,1.0302,1.378,3.4249,2.7961,0.2125,1.1047,1.8528,1.4035,4.009,0.4252,5.0558,0.1854,0.0601,5.4913,1.4064,1.6944,4.3123,0.7592,5.4519,0.0401,4.0552,3.3331,4.9444,0.5166,5.3381,1.2243,0.003,1.7857,5.6398,4.3423,3.313,0.6563,1.4038,0.0082,0.0085,0.0165,0.0078,5.1498,2.8986,4.0897,5.2,3.7217,0.4728,1.3725,4.1231,2.5266,4.5947,5.4255,1.192,3.8032,1.7309,3.5107,2.0677,1.8915,0.6373,2.0158,0.2331,1.7572,1.4157,3.47,5.1126,0.4043,0.5585,5.2194,1.5085,0.146,4.335,3.6267,4.9962,5.2823,0.0462,3.8178,0.948,4.2332,1.0646,2.4346,1.5297,0.4058,3.9021,0.0543,1.7259,3.6933,2.3586,1.5992,5.6121,4.9324,3.1327,4.8988,3.5194,5.5944,3.7393,1.184,3.1884,2.0047,2.64,2.1365,0.1428,1.8625,1.6193,1.8622,1.7351,1.5112,3.253,4.9895,0.4511,2.2304,4.5752,0.1199,3.2206,4.318,4.5242,1.5669,0.5834,2.5661,3.7783,0.7435,4.7378,1.699,1.8302,0.0438,3.2963,2.3554,3.6761,1.0207,3.3865,4.2894,2.3503,0.7906,3.2853,5.2335,5.8846,5.8089,5.2857,1.8611,3.7525,4.1972,5.3566,0.6256,0.4325,2.9423,4.6769,5.7619,1.1186,0.752,4.7731,0.388,7.1969,8.6677,3.3786,5.5675,2.6334,1.6275,1.9137,5.652,1.1306,0.5286,5.6171,5.0325,4.6712,2.525,3.8908,2.8373,2.8571,5.7448,2.7143,2.0174,0.8495,1.4518,1.0307,3.1118,0.0088,3.3498,4.5105,5.3877,1.2726,4.8056,0.5809,1.5178,3.1839,3.9303,0.9139,1.0524,6.614,1.3286,3.842,4.4054,0.036,0.0074,0.0407,0.0125,1.0646,2.2892,1.624,4.7483,4.2067,2.3671,4.8747,2.2363,1.3146,3.6375,1.9555,0.3047,0.3601,2.2741,4.1432,0.1157,1.4786,0.0137,0.0056,0.0067,0.0109,3.2729,1.42,6.4792,0.3085,2.2703,2.8101,5.3438,4.7816,1.5694,1.6838,0.8788,0.0007,1.9253,3.8431,3.6385,0.4746,0.0336,3.1331,2.4907,3.1796,0.6338,3.947,0.0134,0.0042,0.0258,0.0109,4.5268,2.8555,1.0655,3.7363,0.0091,1.5939,2.0593,0.4021,4.7166,1.6695,2.8867,1.9758,5.1981,2.2566,1.4404,0.4375,2.2865,1.8822,0.5176,0.7246,4.2987,4.2418,0.551,0.7744,5.7532,4.6316,5.7116,1.0962,5.4452,4.3115,4.4744,5.754,4.6572,1.2551,5.2174,0.9817,5.6476,4.7601,2.1061,6.0093,1.3673,0.5882,5.0243,2.5678,2.0518,5.0684,0.379,1.8005,2.1951,5.8283,4.3278,2.5424,1.5212,1.4835,3.5202,1.9769,4.852,1.9751,1.7489,0.0305,4.6562,2.3071,4.2315,1.0076,0.0047,2.2148,1.4965,1.5379,2.5588,1.9505,3.5821,3.4513,8.6629,0.4541,4.7073,4.1981,5.0922,0.0591,4.5911,0.0415,3.6817,0.2852,1.5758,1.6213,0.9743,0.0068,1.6832,0.3557,2.7639,4.8388,5.2808,4.2899,0.6092,0.8632,3.473,1.5019,4.7932,0.2656,3.2712,0.0789,0.1834,1.5849,6.1598,1.4781,3.0873,1.3836,2.1489,4.3288,3.2153,3.0196,0.4068,0.0323,1.621,0.7155,4.2358,3.349,3.4252,4.3878,2.5979,1.4557,4.6405,4.7216,1.7089,2.0281,1.8117,1.68,0.9998,2.9051,5.8803,1.0718,3.7343,2.8825,2.3034,0.6586,0.8553,1.7691,5.3087,1.9198,3.3614,0.9051,0.5157,2.9823,0.8665,0.1436,0.1332,0.1922,0.3707,0.4222,2.1689,5.993,1.6678,0.7696,3.0875,4.0495,0.1489,4.7764,4.5244,3.4354,5.5986,4.1418,2.8082,3.8934,0.4932,1.8618,1.7108,0.8347,2.0264,6.2288,0.322,1.9372,0.5038,0.7295,4.1299,1.6059,4.4727,0.0718,2.9166,5.2172,1.892,5.5706,1.2454,3.8307,3.5638,4.8742,3.9589,0.8815,2.9704,1.6946,5.9346,5.7284,5.184,5.8685,1.4307,2.3081,3.39,1.0756]}
{"id":4820,"ended":true,"length":529,"gen_text":"From the early 1860s whaling declined rapidly with the increasing use of petroleum, the onset of the Californian goldrush, and the American Civil War \u2013 with unfortunate consequences for the island. To provide food and shelter in rough seas, the California coast was given the nickname \"The Great Pacific Ocean\" and was then covered with reefs, which enabled the Californians to obtain water they could not source themselves. The Californians quickly took advantage of the opportunity and commenced harvesting of fish before they were shipped to the mainland.\n\nThe Pacific Ocean is what is known as a bicameral zone, but actually is a sub-tropical environment devoid of vegetation and with ocean currents that can change drastically the amount and form of pollution on the surface. A bicameral zone is one the areas of which there may be more trees per acre. As a result more fruits can be created than are obtained by fishing from the bicameral zone, which means that during the cold winter years and the warmer months the ocean is far denser than in the winter and the bicameral zone shifts less during the growing seasons.\n\nThe California coast contains a thick layer of coral and is known as the Pacific Ocean, which is a sub-tropical environment devoid of vegetation and with ocean currents that can change drastically the amount and form of pollution on the surface. The California coast is a great success story \u2013 there are no coastal storms, storms where there is more erosion, or sea level increases of more than ten feet due to the high pressure over the California coastal area due to changes in the environment. Even after three decades of these problems, this California coastal will still be a place that remains unique to our world today if we allow all of our efforts to go forward.\n\nCalifornia is in need of drastic changes in terms of its resources, a changing climate, and the sea level in the Pacific, and we are taking these risks to bring California's citizens a world-class education that will enhance their health, wellbeing, and safety. The California Coast Guard will conduct a major assessment with the Office of the Governor's Assistant Secretary for Environment, Science and Transportation in the coming days and, through the Office of the Secretary of State, the Governor's Office of Information Technology will have a fully formed discussion with the Secretary of the Interior about our potential impact on the California coast. The department's vision is one of clean energy and clean jobs for all living in our state, and now we are starting over.\n\nPlease help preserve the California Coastal by contributing to the Fund for Sustainable Coastal Resources, an initiative to help the Department of Natural Resources develop sustainable solutions to the California Coastal and the Great Pacific Ocean.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nPinterest\n\nReddit\n\nGoogle\n\nTumblr\n\nMore\n\nPrint\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nPocket\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...","token_len":590,"entropy":[2.4913,5.1176,6.8758,0.2259,12.3851,0.952,7.9648,3.5154,4.4342,0.7939,5.5372,2.5664,0.0214,6.1483,2.1672,3.4743,8.9472,0.0157,1.2797,9.6258,0.0172,4.9657,5.5104,1.3869,0.2468,0.7961,4.9423,2.1513,0.0039,6.8793,3.6006,11.0475,0.8592,0.9998,1.0671,6.2415,3.026,5.2822,5.1443,4.4925,1.1852,1.4006,3.2842,5.6131,1.2177,0.5199,1.4708,5.3562,2.8163,0.6501,5.4223,1.4427,1.8129,0.656,2.1355,3.2929,2.9787,2.4148,1.9074,1.784,1.997,3.963,4.0409,0.7607,5.3103,1.3642,2.8163,4.6637,1.17,3.2597,0.6133,0.0898,5.1632,5.0491,5.0234,1.4347,0.6743,6.4274,2.8567,0.417,2.1001,3.6642,0.726,5.1071,4.494,1.4537,0.0062,0.904,3.7016,2.0043,5.6144,3.7423,5.7312,3.5047,6.8438,2.2178,1.8557,3.2452,1.0698,1.1168,2.1167,0.5156,1.5015,0.0051,1.7097,4.3119,1.161,1.4833,5.843,2.4052,0.9585,0.286,1.0743,6.3265,4.5189,0.9502,0.0009,2.8915,1.0906,3.999,6.014,1.8533,1.1382,3.9317,0.7886,1.2971,0.008,4.6426,5.8471,0.0022,3.8146,1.4684,5.0448,5.1397,0.954,2.1586,2.3761,4.5943,4.4147,4.3916,2.571,3.4421,4.6002,0.2211,5.5981,4.9313,0.579,1.5318,0.6058,4.0517,2.5905,0.0162,0.0112,0.0005,0.1164,0.8498,3.1237,6.5709,5.1865,1.4632,5.5825,3.1066,4.9914,0.3001,3.8495,6.2868,3.796,1.6562,2.7991,3.6832,1.6005,0.1576,6.4734,5.6602,2.9606,0.1062,6.7067,2.9565,2.2141,5.3576,1.9026,3.129,4.0371,0.7897,2.5034,0.1464,0.0161,0.0012,0.268,1.7128,1.6199,2.6934,1.1953,5.7993,0.5652,4.8467,2.5701,2.7411,5.171,1.8406,3.0927,0.4199,2.0475,3.1258,2.1685,4.4976,5.9748,0.0081,1.118,2.341,0.3688,3.1542,2.9363,2.0944,2.5209,0.0693,0.0106,0.0007,0.306,6.1262,5.0806,4.0981,0.4414,5.4328,2.4062,0.2139,1.1821,0.0003,1.6698,2.2472,1.4282,4.6887,2.0474,6.2932,0.8473,0.0112,2.3577,1.9338,3.2257,2.6729,0.2337,0.5547,3.1315,1.1179,2.2643,1.662,0.9139,2.6331,3.8832,0.0783,0.0052,0.0083,0.5632,0.8107,0.0005,0.1634,0.2598,0.3446,0.0449,0.0019,0.0419,0.0129,0.0249,0.3889,0.0153,0.0103,0.0093,0.0022,0.0015,0.0096,0.0395,0.0032,0.0005,0.0527,2.343,0.5685,0.0915,1.0585,2.1559,4.0967,5.0438,0.7125,4.8874,4.0643,0.5057,2.8404,4.5332,4.4077,1.3417,4.9412,5.2911,1.5712,0.6723,3.9511,4.7859,1.1837,1.9988,5.3276,0.5083,4.0379,2.7033,1.0168,0.0157,3.8232,0.3315,4.3606,0.0043,1.5539,3.4195,3.6595,4.4805,0.4116,3.3241,4.3628,1.7787,4.3852,0.0071,5.7635,0.0628,0.8611,5.0113,0.7343,5.5238,3.916,5.4,1.1271,0.3816,5.378,5.3921,0.6253,4.4266,3.9574,2.89,5.8151,1.0498,1.0556,1.667,3.9253,2.5653,2.9389,5.0365,1.7338,3.1947,2.8105,2.9563,6.4396,0.9587,3.7451,3.8697,1.1325,1.3773,2.7866,0.4351,4.0315,0.9085,0.7157,0.4241,0.0003,3.4768,1.3492,5.0026,3.6307,0.0177,5.6995,1.3298,1.5518,4.1264,0.0016,1.3898,4.6932,1.3769,5.4393,5.1004,0.5284,0.4291,0.4738,1.7876,5.717,0.2428,3.7787,0.9257,2.7144,2.9576,1.792,2.0795,1.6287,3.7199,3.6448,5.4316,0.9159,4.3119,3.3578,2.0008,5.4448,2.4176,4.0026,1.7892,0.0306,1.6375,3.3505,0.85,4.4847,0.3939,3.4096,0.8218,3.9216,0.1876,0.1903,3.4463,0.3836,3.0375,1.8451,1.7102,0.2157,2.2738,4.4183,1.362,4.1618,5.4952,4.8478,0.9116,5.293,0.0182,1.5127,2.8031,3.6847,4.6317,0.9515,1.4917,4.3716,1.5787,3.118,0.9837,3.8823,2.9378,2.1567,0.5669,1.7692,1.8619,6.2051,4.6686,0.9712,2.6903,0.0364,0.6347,1.5061,0.3818,1.0239,0.5211,2.1755,3.1908,0.8798,0.8763,0.1649,5.2996,1.5484,1.732,4.5908,1.6492,5.1807,3.6608,5.1888,1.0716,0.8167,3.2072,0.1941,2.0218,0.5424,2.5389,3.5539,5.1609,3.2328,0.2337,0.8165,1.2493,0.6444,0.5858,2.8011,5.7415,2.4716,5.6118,1.3111,5.0135,1.2019,5.0162,1.3196,1.6121,2.6561,3.487,2.1872,0.9791,6.7393,0.8547,2.7696,0.3377,1.4786,0.8651,6.1503,1.4214,0.9286,4.2657,5.8983,0.9468,0.5186,0.0002,4.4354,2.9458,5.1093,1.163,1.0579,4.5897,1.3116,4.3315,0.579,1.1332,5.637,0.5929,3.8538,2.9575,1.4196,1.9874,2.6354,1.5898,2.966,2.2925,2.5968,2.9688,0.1088,3.769,0.0021,3.5162,2.7573,3.4172,0.5483,1.3055,1.2991,1.0093,2.5595,1.9603,3.6969,0.9067,0.1076,0.3835,1.2148,0.0002,4.4664,0.2501,0.1238,0.7463,0.0013,0.0002,0.1739,0.0363,0.0001,1.6853,0.0758,0.0002,1.5688,0.1861,0.0001,1.0152,0.1876,0.0001,0.6637,0.335,0.0002,1.9206,0.0049,0.0001,1.2945,0.0191,0.0002,0.4647,0.0157,0.0003,0.239,0.1172,0.0002,3.0309,0.0023,0.0005,0.3165,0.0003,1.5439,0.0014,0.0006,0.0,0.0,0.0036]}
{"id":2143,"ended":false,"length":523,"gen_text":"Construction of the video sculpture was completed for testing without the fountain's water features on May 18, 2004. Originally, Plensa had planned to have each face appear for 13 minutes, but after three weeks, it fell through to just six minutes. During the final inspection, none of the surfaces were altered for any reason, although those that did actually look to be painted, were altered as well. An early photograph showed that the main fountain is now being replaced with a bronze and bronze colored copper pipe.\n\nThe sculpture on the site is part of a series of smaller exhibits that include three new buildings for new businesses, one for temporary residents of the area, and a new dining and retail space. While one gallery space recently had its final opening, the second with a glass door, will be open for use this fall.\n\nFollow us @CitizenWork and @CityLab for continuing coverage from our new gallery, including a new section titled 'The City of Oakland' and new live coverage from the Newsroom, and our live video archive.\n\n\nCity Council meeting, Sept. 20.\n\nJoin us in Oakland on Sept. 7 for a discussion on how the City Council handled this situation on Sept. 19, when a motion supporting building tax cuts was advanced to council. A portion of the City Council voted against the effort to move forward with the plan (with the rest voting against it anyways), and the mayor had been lobbying against it in the months leading up to the vote.\n\nContact @ChrystleGorrisio at chrystle.gregrisio@arc.com or City Manager David Williams at dhamilton@citylab.org.\n\nMore from CitizenWork:\n\nThe city is trying to convince residents and their organizations in this part of Oakland to send the bill to the Assembly for their consideration in a special meeting. (Sept. 19 is the deadline to vote on House Bill 1329). The issue was on Tuesday, Sept. 20 when a small meeting of the Council was taken up. The proposal includes a $10 million revenue source, an education program, community amenities, food and beverage taxes and, most of all, a one-person council meeting on Sept. 19. The House voted unanimously to pass the bill with a 7-5 vote, with six abstentions: City Council member Linda Holmes, one of the council's seven Democrats; and Oakland Public Workers Local 851 executive director Paul Schulman. The proposal is now sitting on the City Council. As a community activist with Community Oriented Policing, the Council has been vocal about the needs for improved access to housing by public-employer workers, onerous job training and mandatory worker registration, to encourage workers to have the right skills needed to be a part of the workforce.\n\nFor more from CitizenWork, check out our interactive map and follow us on Twitter!","token_len":590,"entropy":[3.3333,1.5493,9.6326,10.892,3.3138,2.1719,5.1446,6.5158,8.1033,2.0153,12.569,3.2791,4.0771,6.3724,4.8071,4.2164,3.4548,0.8898,4.7925,0.4695,8.1071,1.2511,8.674,7.1118,3.8769,2.5442,1.3538,0.2704,3.136,6.0288,7.3746,6.36,5.5338,6.9678,1.613,1.1256,0.5714,3.0364,5.0682,2.6013,1.4095,2.3877,4.709,2.1627,2.9815,3.5674,3.2049,0.5963,0.421,5.0849,0.9923,2.4466,5.1521,0.4806,6.8921,0.0422,0.1094,4.7131,0.9795,5.3228,4.4749,2.4815,1.5471,1.4084,3.9821,6.1295,1.951,1.5216,5.8627,2.3375,5.5165,0.8277,4.9455,3.2803,2.0876,5.5319,3.8303,0.5103,0.2394,5.4779,4.5638,4.6492,3.7039,2.2655,0.8002,5.3825,3.0624,3.3199,3.1306,4.8597,2.6061,0.942,0.4901,5.4836,4.2233,3.099,5.3001,5.8832,5.2111,0.9049,1.2315,0.0266,1.8368,2.7679,5.6257,0.993,5.315,1.7446,3.5613,0.0032,0.9028,2.0953,0.2776,5.5544,4.9328,2.0565,3.1662,5.2861,3.2578,5.1106,3.656,5.8558,2.4808,1.2304,3.4099,1.1679,6.1275,3.9387,3.2536,1.2208,2.7909,0.6537,0.5101,1.2697,1.9238,5.5437,2.4932,3.0711,1.7997,1.1294,5.6761,5.2628,6.3449,5.6995,5.8613,4.0212,1.8401,5.5542,2.5639,0.3532,1.084,3.1695,6.1532,1.4646,4.2562,3.9432,2.0759,2.5738,1.2639,1.744,1.6333,5.1002,3.7613,1.4804,0.3477,0.8901,0.0003,4.6941,3.4072,1.7319,4.9862,3.1144,5.3959,2.0204,2.159,3.721,2.8996,0.7991,6.0447,0.3851,3.0425,2.9644,2.7933,4.6583,1.4861,5.1715,2.4546,3.0645,5.1493,4.4404,3.3622,2.2811,2.9713,1.6772,4.0497,2.5684,2.2615,4.0608,5.5911,2.1642,1.4987,1.6788,5.5216,1.1536,2.8551,2.9963,3.6356,3.1299,3.7647,2.7756,0.716,4.1941,0.0006,3.2852,2.7932,5.3435,3.535,3.8626,0.0994,3.2011,3.2564,1.2858,0.0002,4.7054,0.9477,2.2729,2.9616,1.9133,0.6771,0.0098,5.3766,0.7389,1.0651,3.1139,1.517,2.6551,1.5676,2.3351,1.8248,5.2105,3.129,4.5927,4.889,1.6897,0.0168,2.5871,1.6408,0.9491,2.2978,4.6384,5.8122,5.2611,4.971,3.7904,1.1061,6.1975,2.5181,3.3148,0.6159,4.3077,4.7391,0.0244,0.3276,5.5744,0.1895,1.8957,2.1712,0.4925,7.0623,2.6677,4.1536,0.8888,0.6627,0.7507,2.8446,4.7495,3.3592,2.4629,4.4665,1.6663,1.3871,1.6113,6.8226,1.1906,1.3209,1.6379,4.8032,4.5142,4.5327,5.3261,2.7019,1.003,2.9418,0.8443,4.6392,1.0224,0.0122,0.0262,0.5167,0.9689,0.3734,0.9779,0.0003,5.2806,5.5219,5.7977,4.2235,0.5465,5.0315,4.3394,5.1629,4.1602,5.7321,1.273,2.0151,0.3756,0.0101,0.1703,0.6524,4.747,10.5302,0.9505,0.0546,0.0395,6.2266,0.4576,0.9505,1.0477,4.3587,4.4415,4.0385,5.911,0.0996,1.6152,6.3277,0.5146,0.1242,2.6417,0.7947,0.0096,0.7804,0.4687,1.0243,0.0003,4.865,1.9326,2.6879,0.5151,0.5973,0.7895,0.0002,2.6404,3.1324,2.4404,3.7027,0.0813,4.8163,3.5236,3.4032,4.6544,5.2538,4.6661,5.1363,3.7701,0.0071,1.3747,0.4467,5.3976,3.331,5.7343,0.7388,0.7163,4.4855,1.5383,4.6077,0.9487,2.9414,3.2363,1.3887,3.2517,2.0922,3.5297,3.762,0.0954,2.2052,7.2437,1.5004,1.9829,1.639,2.0905,0.387,6.4486,0.0252,3.5391,4.4523,3.3159,2.5919,4.6821,2.3773,4.9796,6.1604,2.8758,0.8498,0.0061,1.7537,2.5301,2.2142,4.9456,5.3059,1.3059,0.5334,2.6962,1.6974,5.4893,0.5151,2.19,1.6004,4.164,4.7399,1.0228,2.6662,3.0459,0.8262,5.4931,3.7831,2.0293,4.1657,5.5442,2.7715,0.8545,5.182,4.6755,0.7429,5.7468,1.3955,1.5077,2.9384,1.5129,5.3735,2.3616,2.9673,0.0031,0.0276,1.0217,5.3412,0.1172,6.1482,3.1001,2.47,3.2592,1.2979,0.0187,1.0501,0.3965,1.6992,5.1483,2.9264,3.1913,0.6733,1.9853,0.3438,0.6665,3.4721,1.324,5.2023,0.1031,2.8445,0.0986,1.7957,1.5296,4.5837,0.9335,0.0105,0.0001,5.2462,4.7475,0.6648,2.157,5.315,4.89,0.7318,6.1224,0.6783,0.4975,2.7528,0.2504,4.0693,4.0213,1.1578,2.8197,2.6023,4.2475,6.9613,2.1834,3.3207,4.783,5.0488,0.226,5.2763,4.7881,4.401,0.2861,0.3248,1.8396,3.8991,2.4541,3.1468,5.9303,0.9892,0.3791,2.1322,0.1054,1.434,5.9294,2.4461,5.6155,4.6311,4.0922,5.1013,4.3212,0.0001,0.6993,0.002,1.0193,2.9712,3.102,2.1456,1.647,4.0375,0.9767,1.2537,3.989,2.3777,4.6944,4.4008,0.1982,3.4301,5.6197,4.8683,2.61,3.8532,3.0829,2.3641,1.651,5.9526,3.0079,4.0173,2.6945,2.12,5.9179,5.5462,5.2512,2.8282,4.4323,5.4646,3.714,0.197,4.5328,2.9301,1.2789,3.3588,5.5491,0.3366,2.7852,3.7113,1.0469,0.097,0.6941,1.666,0.4074,1.3759,0.0002,4.3761,0.3694,2.3307,1.1182,0.0061,0.3182,2.3836,0.024,0.9379,4.9636,1.5734,2.722,3.5828,0.4269,0.3641,0.4757,4.4279]}
{"id":487,"ended":true,"length":521,"gen_text":"By 14 December, Vokes had devised a new assault plan for taking The Gully. A small force from the Royal 22e R\u00e9giment would move to Casa Berardi, a small set of farmhouses next to the main roads in the village to provide cover against the rebels.\n\nThe rebels did manage to make it to Casa Berardi. They managed to get to the village, where a group of volunteers entered using an AK-47 rifle. Inside was Captain Jean G\u00e9liss and a group of rebels.\n\nA group of about 10 or 11 men formed a large guard-army and marched in. The men were accompanied by a few men from the Royal 22e R\u00e9giment. The rebels had moved on but had only managed to escape the village with a few casualties.\n\nIn late 14 December, Vokes took orders to hold more ground in the vicinity of his village. He thought it would be possible to capture large houses but that had proved too late considering the rebels were not yet defeated. They were to go in a force and commandeer a small detachment of about 500 of the Royal 22e R\u00e9giment. G\u00e9liss was also able to obtain a small force from the royal militia.\n\nIn the early 15 th century, when Charles VII was overthrown by the French in 1595 through the capture of the French territory which had already been contested with the French in 1613, the royal army consisted of 15 hundred strong soldiers. During the Civil War, the Royal Guards Regiment gained the position of a small force and was led by Napoleon Bonaparte, who became king in 1707. He would continue to command at least a dozen regiments under the command of Alexander I after he died 1592. The Royal 21e R\u00e9giment and their forces comprised approximately 300 persons with an army numbering about a hundred thousand men at the time.\n\nDuring WWI, the Royal 21e R\u00e9giment captured a small part of France. However, for the remainder of the war, Vokes was able to continue command and command his company with the help of the French.\n\nThe Royal 21e R\u00e9giment have served over twenty years in the French Army. Today, they have the number two position in artillery formation. In 1943, Vokes was appointed commander of the Royal 24th Regiment and was given command responsibility of his company. He had one company of 3 men in the Royal 21e R\u00e9giment on the west coast of France but had to send three of his men over in order to make the attack.\n\nThe Royal 23\u00e9 Army, the army of the royal family, currently stands in the center of France.\n\nVokes is on his way back to the city from a brief stay at St. Denis, but the rebels are not back yet. He can be reached via the road to Carla and from there, on foot, on foot.","token_len":594,"entropy":[8.0978,5.1045,1.4338,7.0497,7.4634,3.5065,8.806,0.4826,2.6848,9.5511,5.6026,1.9645,6.5318,8.8402,6.3019,4.6667,2.1304,4.3573,4.7277,2.7642,4.8291,1.0935,4.2612,11.1766,9.975,10.7099,0.6434,1.6597,3.6169,5.1833,2.0392,9.0249,2.9188,6.6814,5.042,1.056,2.1511,1.9727,9.9725,0.1008,6.3501,1.1695,4.956,0.3826,0.6444,3.543,4.3837,2.7069,0.8284,2.5529,4.9303,3.6559,2.6059,2.9366,0.9333,5.254,0.4661,1.9617,0.0064,1.7261,2.9852,5.3229,3.616,0.0361,4.5204,0.7866,1.1128,1.0973,0.0026,0.0377,0.0008,2.5116,2.8942,4.3557,0.0376,2.5473,2.5451,0.7071,2.8129,1.8604,1.8788,2.6239,2.5395,0.0324,4.9029,5.8269,6.9308,3.9011,4.4353,0.2131,0.0166,2.2935,0.9134,5.5857,3.5403,5.9316,3.9236,5.0339,4.17,3.1894,5.6148,3.5306,2.1774,1.7212,0.0227,4.6246,1.4051,2.1392,0.0001,3.6749,2.8053,0.0684,4.6102,2.9451,4.1841,1.6587,1.6977,5.6786,0.6714,4.3723,3.7809,5.7897,4.2263,1.27,1.9853,3.499,2.9748,2.434,1.6766,2.9994,2.1493,4.9693,0.0229,1.5104,2.9468,3.0518,0.827,0.4919,1.3794,1.4026,0.0379,0.0755,0.0021,0.0009,1.0129,1.5175,2.4765,3.2827,4.7752,2.6235,3.9876,3.1808,3.8661,3.2428,0.0153,2.6617,2.8573,1.7992,3.4256,1.9705,1.3905,3.5801,0.2007,0.8775,0.0001,3.4718,5.2874,4.4461,0.3563,0.4428,1.6329,0.0011,4.2068,4.8042,1.247,5.2502,6.4938,4.1483,1.7382,0.762,4.4057,0.2835,5.2103,2.7218,0.5619,1.2728,5.6536,1.8,0.8018,0.4638,3.1699,0.1555,3.7645,5.9238,5.3427,3.8266,3.7899,4.749,3.9368,2.4271,3.4774,7.4114,0.9735,2.4774,1.7276,3.4317,3.372,5.6755,0.2284,4.1473,1.8216,4.6424,4.2774,3.2772,2.953,5.4032,4.0868,5.5563,0.7565,2.0971,1.6532,3.9363,0.5152,4.8496,3.9801,4.6293,0.5395,0.7712,0.2054,0.0146,0.0242,0.001,0.0138,1.3743,5.8898,0.1633,0.0028,0.0029,2.5748,3.7947,4.699,0.0048,5.6601,1.7713,1.9809,1.7003,1.4939,0.8214,4.6893,3.9297,1.1777,0.639,0.0001,3.023,1.269,3.0923,2.1706,4.1348,0.3641,0.4123,3.6058,5.1526,3.5177,1.5929,5.2465,0.0097,1.0759,1.2484,1.0903,1.4283,1.7243,4.462,8.1158,1.4365,4.5442,0.0477,1.7407,2.7043,4.2514,5.0354,1.1066,4.3921,0.1411,5.1379,4.2207,0.663,2.3761,1.7043,2.0083,4.2121,0.227,1.1877,4.3709,2.4032,4.8864,0.149,4.3034,6.1537,4.2276,2.8539,0.991,4.4985,0.5709,5.0535,0.0284,0.8947,1.2415,1.5272,5.2577,6.3018,5.8129,2.5047,5.3837,0.1817,2.5224,2.6351,1.2511,2.328,2.285,4.7044,0.058,5.9112,1.4512,0.0008,0.0009,1.9608,1.2248,4.193,3.3519,1.0538,1.547,3.5001,0.1929,3.6405,4.5695,4.071,0.6245,2.5538,4.4323,2.4894,2.6353,2.9408,1.6132,0.0041,4.0469,1.345,1.0618,0.0109,5.7853,2.5274,5.4608,1.6565,2.2795,7.3816,3.7532,0.2081,2.5389,1.0883,4.9646,0.2916,0.087,0.0013,0.0023,4.3681,3.4607,3.6965,4.9323,3.5674,3.7315,6.3871,4.8721,2.9086,2.8598,5.366,1.8898,4.0344,1.0696,0.4319,0.7197,4.5429,0.7353,0.2327,0.6997,0.6162,0.0002,3.2305,5.3198,0.7079,0.3478,0.8445,0.4,1.6376,0.0106,0.0122,0.0009,0.0013,4.7259,2.3676,2.1388,2.1173,0.0097,1.6984,1.7753,3.104,0.0598,5.5512,1.1926,3.442,0.0482,0.4565,0.3074,0.4068,4.9193,0.002,2.1711,1.3903,0.005,5.2181,3.839,2.9781,2.6712,2.7792,4.7877,3.0633,1.2865,1.112,0.0045,1.4807,2.7441,1.6219,1.6848,0.0002,2.218,1.2091,1.0454,0.0071,0.0125,0.0009,0.0017,5.1784,5.5602,4.7111,4.6072,0.7672,0.8124,0.9556,1.5907,1.0778,0.9976,6.3124,0.4754,1.1859,2.4323,3.49,5.203,3.4669,0.8716,0.5856,7.1731,5.5042,1.5495,3.0292,5.2676,0.3357,2.5239,0.0025,1.5854,2.263,2.2626,0.1571,0.3791,0.8481,4.1783,1.308,0.7173,1.6626,1.9755,2.7796,1.0195,6.4966,0.8017,3.2793,1.8534,0.7539,2.2251,3.0337,5.5505,3.8219,1.5198,5.324,2.4096,2.5206,1.3773,1.8994,2.1912,0.0145,0.0139,0.0009,0.0018,4.0432,1.2206,4.8623,2.0837,0.2948,0.4612,3.7581,2.4962,1.7625,5.0725,4.1989,1.9199,0.6656,0.8936,4.67,3.6172,0.5776,0.0602,3.4687,1.9939,4.9737,0.8612,1.2203,0.0002,1.83,0.5478,3.4171,6.743,5.8519,2.9733,2.7973,4.7788,0.6742,0.8247,4.9886,1.1457,0.7795,5.6528,4.2567,2.5132,1.2922,4.5291,0.1188,1.2306,0.7261,2.5409,0.0003,3.6485,0.0498,1.9849,5.5719,2.9863,1.1214,2.3188,0.3733,2.0678,5.2116,4.7972,3.231,5.6858,0.9219,1.8963,3.7386,0.519,3.0936,1.7369,3.4939,2.8715,4.7906,1.1604,2.8161,3.724,1.0885,0.2207,2.4126,4.7422,1.1428,1.1963,2.7548,1.139,4.4667,1.473,5.8516,5.6514,3.2679,3.5853,0.5886,2.4324,3.6829,0.5673,1.0539,3.2062,1.1247,1.4331]}
{"id":3940,"ended":false,"length":551,"gen_text":"Since the end of the Hannah era in 1969, Michigan State has shifted its focus from increasing the size of its student body to advancing its national and global reputation. In September 2005, the university opened its fifth football practice in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The athletic department's primary responsibility is to make academic and student learning more efficient and to provide for the educational needs of students.\n\nThis latest trend is significant because while we have been learning about the value of our time and our place in the world, we've also failed to realize that our most precious commodity is that of time. The University is the world's best teacher. The nation's biggest university has been in the forefront of the development and growth of American exceptionalism for years, since 1968. In 1968, the number of state-funded scholarships to undergraduate degrees jumped from 6,500 to more than 80,000. At that time, more than $13 billion was raised by students and professors during the school's undergraduate and graduate programs.\n\nWe are, however, in a very different era.\n\nToday, about three out of every three American children have a college degree or higher in any of our major fields or on any part of the university. By 2030, roughly two-thirds of American college-aged children (63 percent) will have a college degree. And in many of these classes, the average student has only earned a degree once or twice. This is why we need to increase the number and breadth of opportunities we offer to college-educated students so that we can make sure our students can live as they want to.\n\nWe will now be working to make it easier for young people to go to college using the same educational resources that they have received in the classroom, study abroad, and so forth. This includes providing opportunities for them at U.S. colleges and universities, as well as private tutoring and support agencies that do many of these things for student performance.\n\nThese policies will enhance American academic performance by advancing American students' academic achievement in every field and at every level of education. And given that young people will be starting college at an early age, we will want their choice of colleges and universities to shape their academic success rather than make it more of the same. This isn't simply an issue of having a college degree, it's one of our greatest values.\n\nStudent accountability is important. If you want to succeed, think about being on the world's most famous university. That is what many Americans have wanted us to do.

{"id":906,"ended":false,"length":549,"gen_text":"Growing up in Hibbing, Minnesota, Dylan and his family were part of the area's small but close @ - @ knit Jewish community, and in May 1954 Dylan had his Barra 'N' Bock (pronounced Ruh-nah) barber shop opened in downtown Rochester with his partner, Kelli Roshai.\n\n-, Roshai, a part of the area's small but close, married Kelli during their first year after coming to Rochester.\n\n. The only Jewish house on campus, it's located at 1 Main Road, between North and South Road (at North and West Road ), has always been a Jewish school, but now the main campus residence home is on 9th Ave\/B Street.\n\n) was the first Jewish school to open in Rochester & Minnesota, with plans to open more Jewish housing in East Rochester & Rochester, which was the center of the Jewish community after decades of being converted to Gentile lifestyle and new homes were built. As part of their development plan however, Dylan's parents, who have been Jewish since their very first year of living in Rochester & Minnesota, created a separate home for their children to attend. As of 2013, the Jewish home has been renamed the American Jewish Center, but there were no official names of the new buildings to be announced. When asked by locals which particular Jewish home will change the way Rochester &Minnesota is perceived, several residents say that there are already Jewish neighborhoods and that the area is already thriving due to the diversity of families and friends.\n\n. The two youngest children, ages 14 and 10, will now be starting school at a local local and Jewish school in Rochester. Currently, it's the only place in Minnesota where the term \"Jew\" is used so their mother and father are Jewish. This is expected to change as more people in Minneapolis & St. Paul find that 'Jew' is the new buzz word for things that may not be considered at time of posting this article (click over to the original article ).\n\nWhile this is an excellent move for children of multiple communities, it will certainly leave a massive void left in the community's overall landscape.\n\nIt will also have a chilling effect on some of the young Jews that have been left with no real outlet to do their education, much less be friends. The entire community needs to know that their grandparents, great grandparents, parents who are Jewish, siblings, friends, family, friends, and neighbors. They now need to stay together to take care of their grandchildren.\n\nThese families, along with many others who are struggling to learn about Judaism from a shared home and want the same opportunity to succeed they found on campus, are looking to provide more Jewish care and support for their children.\n\nYou can support the efforts for Jewish community development in Rochester, Minnesota by going to https:\/\/www.josunivol.org\/\n\nRelated\n\nArticle: Rochester Jewish Community","token_len":597,"entropy":[5.9479,1.0347,10.6197,1.2304,0.4569,5.5178,0.1819,6.9815,3.1301,1.8308,2.0316,1.9467,5.2567,0.0845,1.0454,6.5512,0.0975,4.4658,2.5861,6.8487,15.405,10.3975,6.2401,10.4316,10.0729,0.4362,3.0435,2.282,4.3779,5.6072,7.7641,3.3427,4.4106,1.4772,9.6335,5.6154,6.8528,4.1741,1.9681,4.3108,3.3315,4.2686,4.8325,0.0071,4.6156,3.5537,0.3681,4.3189,1.4337,4.1944,3.7125,2.0243,2.6843,1.4753,3.7498,5.6625,4.7157,1.7949,3.3212,1.0953,5.6705,2.4074,5.0817,4.5161,5.8355,0.4941,1.9329,0.0234,15.9196,4.0962,1.1221,0.076,1.6157,3.8134,5.8347,0.5588,0.6725,6.0058,0.0781,1.2558,0.5493,0.033,3.866,6.7372,3.8555,0.0267,4.9377,1.8886,2.0859,1.1605,6.8514,6.763,0.4963,1.1791,1.0297,1.7738,0.0004,4.4893,3.4806,5.9769,3.0262,6.0673,1.8769,4.0173,1.695,3.5589,1.8468,2.8014,2.0976,4.5374,5.1334,5.3644,1.3895,5.0697,4.9495,1.3195,0.6016,4.9102,3.6537,5.1792,3.6411,1.9547,3.5715,2.8696,6.0275,4.1815,6.1251,0.4837,1.4548,1.981,5.4332,1.8008,2.6153,3.8135,2.723,4.5461,2.7118,4.3032,5.909,1.025,3.4212,6.3513,1.3714,2.3402,5.0219,4.1397,4.1393,1.2889,1.1164,0.0004,5.0909,3.5316,2.9832,1.3648,0.9666,3.0194,1.675,0.8278,0.8105,0.7995,5.5541,5.0551,1.5908,3.0566,5.787,0.4516,1.2737,4.8436,1.7315,4.8499,1.4575,6.2547,0.9909,1.7896,3.7616,2.4714,3.839,2.2941,2.4982,4.3188,0.129,0.8263,1.8374,0.3636,5.4236,6.5573,0.0921,3.9302,5.0173,0.3601,5.2933,0.1324,5.3815,3.232,6.0182,3.505,2.2771,1.1783,1.2455,5.1082,2.8501,0.0022,2.169,4.383,2.1609,7.3688,0.2331,4.4145,2.5557,2.6054,3.0804,3.03,3.9984,1.7473,1.7183,1.171,1.6724,3.4606,0.8443,1.616,1.1937,3.2826,0.4634,0.5189,2.6101,0.4056,0.2159,5.3109,0.8179,4.3038,3.4862,0.8972,1.0786,1.6403,2.8467,3.8494,1.5744,4.3504,1.7029,4.0376,0.365,1.2941,3.4022,2.6117,1.7976,1.1538,3.4965,1.9456,6.1602,0.688,1.664,2.0209,3.5518,3.5978,3.9701,1.4112,3.46,3.0877,3.1475,0.3856,2.0878,3.903,3.7153,0.7636,0.6975,0.866,6.295,1.8892,2.7547,6.3014,5.9139,6.1621,2.1544,1.6476,2.8474,6.5124,1.3111,2.9749,3.7736,1.0238,7.6317,1.8426,2.3659,1.1642,5.0962,2.7222,4.8313,1.5761,3.2886,1.4993,4.2277,3.3113,3.9261,2.9524,1.709,1.8261,3.9413,1.1605,3.653,3.384,4.9023,0.0255,0.8819,4.6276,0.3567,4.2265,1.4393,3.8021,0.9688,0.7408,0.0004,1.5082,1.4373,6.0259,5.888,1.0832,2.0643,2.9763,4.5744,0.5999,3.2702,0.2447,3.4868,4.3092,1.1634,4.9724,1.7567,1.3013,3.3888,2.704,5.3532,5.4835,1.8425,0.6384,1.8382,1.7763,1.4685,6.0869,0.4492,4.1487,1.2592,1.8596,2.7337,3.6864,1.0247,3.153,0.948,2.0177,6.2571,0.7817,4.0925,0.1032,0.5797,0.7972,6.7478,4.7797,5.0854,2.0775,0.6299,1.8079,1.3846,0.6654,4.4306,1.7241,3.9645,0.0639,1.171,1.5226,1.5985,2.6361,3.6338,5.3994,3.8449,3.063,0.0753,0.0533,4.2529,3.2239,5.9662,0.7204,0.066,0.7812,3.9811,3.2651,4.0395,2.1872,1.4981,5.2854,1.9665,4.3794,1.2396,0.5305,2.8266,4.5756,6.3394,0.3553,4.5307,3.9643,0.8966,4.5265,5.1066,7.4037,0.3863,1.4471,4.3455,1.1828,5.9436,0.517,0.0006,6.0161,3.4958,1.5958,2.9509,4.1627,3.49,1.1235,5.2703,1.4329,6.3846,5.5367,0.9359,0.985,2.8503,3.1327,3.5469,1.3967,6.2174,1.076,5.0354,2.2139,0.611,1.9611,3.3462,4.6541,5.58,0.9631,1.7815,0.0005,4.0851,2.0604,0.7511,3.4015,1.0544,4.8616,0.1957,0.1043,4.7268,1.0685,0.3146,3.664,3.8235,2.3907,2.1543,1.6721,3.5927,4.1812,1.9701,4.4098,5.2663,1.1638,5.3365,1.4184,4.1629,1.912,5.0741,0.3757,4.1419,5.7929,2.4591,3.1783,5.6359,0.9617,3.8782,0.2371,3.2902,0.4897,2.5491,5.3483,2.0154,2.5838,0.9678,0.3634,4.283,3.877,2.6709,1.4255,0.8109,4.7149,0.7233,2.1813,0.5272,2.9762,1.3459,2.3813,1.1097,1.3984,2.1044,3.7827,3.1467,6.3575,1.6875,0.3272,5.6874,2.8412,2.959,4.9295,0.5182,0.0131,0.9154,3.6526,1.1956,0.727,0.0004,5.3435,4.6898,2.9561,3.423,0.003,1.8949,0.5764,2.1117,1.6827,2.8862,1.2775,5.5051,2.0319,1.7606,3.5384,2.5803,5.8635,4.3663,2.2666,5.4275,3.3518,2.1137,3.4462,1.3466,3.6016,5.05,5.3601,4.1838,2.0163,0.3491,1.5822,3.7115,1.0181,5.567,3.8464,2.1584,6.0653,1.6083,1.1356,1.9152,0.4626,0.7494,0.6617,0.7948,0.0003,5.3026,0.2922,2.4767,1.6632,2.9292,5.0668,2.6204,2.6763,2.6695,2.0421,1.2457,2.6539,0.729,0.6062,4.0926,0.214,3.2882,0.0008,0.4364,0.0007,4.7478,4.8293,4.2041,5.0695,6.1489,1.7083,0.2015,0.324,2.7497,0.0005,4.7559,2.7939,0.0004,5.2032,2.0257,3.8077,1.6048,0.9269]}
{"id":3103,"ended":false,"length":569,"gen_text":"Disney Consumer Products created a small line of products to cater to a more adult audience, given the show \u2019 s edgier tone. Paul Gitter, senior VP of Marvel Licensing for Disney, told Polygon that in the coming months, the Marvel Comics family of movies will add more genres of play to the comic book franchises, although those will likely contain new storylines in several aspects.\n\nThis could change once the Marvel-Disney collaboration ends. According to Gitter, after Disney and Disney shared creative team information about the project, Marvel announced he wanted to put his comics franchise on hiatus for three years so it was possible to have more stories in one book. (For more details on Gitter, check out his Marvel Twitter account.) It's hard to overstate just how much the Marvel-Disney collaboration may have impacted the development of the series.\n\nHere's the big takeaway from our latest report from our friends at Collider (click on the link to read the full report):\n\n1.) One week after creating the new characters in the new Marvel TV series, Marvel TV will finally give their viewers access to the original Super hero comics, based on a line of comics which began in 1985. As of now, the Marvel Comics team consists of three members of the comic book world. (There are already more than 40 series based on characters from the comics, which will all be based on the Marvel TV series.)\n\n2.) At the same time, the Marvel TV series will no longer contain every single character's origin story, allowing for two main versions instead. The two series are also based on three distinct characters. The first series will be \"The Marvel Girl,\" which shows off the very real, if distant, secret relationship between Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Emma Frost, and the second series will be \"The Marvel Girl and the Supergirl,\" which shows off a very similar relationship between Marvel's Supergirl and the Superboy. No final decision yet as to whether or not those stories will be canceled will be revealed at the end of the year.\n\n3). If Marvel makes it possible for some Marvel Comics character story material to be shared in the future, then, it will likely follow a similar path.\n\nOf course, it's hard to say if that's how it'll work without even a hint of Disney's direction. The company has long said that Marvel TV is focused on making TV based cartoons for Marvel TV, and then on the upcoming Supergirl TV series. They also recently announced Disney TV plans to bring back \"Fable 2,\" with new, different Supergirl characters.\n\nFor now, you can read that statement straight out of Marvel Studios president Josh Horowitz talking on his Fox News panel this Saturday, while Marvel teased the release of the second Marvel show that they're working on. After all, what they're saying is that there's much more to the Marvel-Disney relationship than just \"Avengers\"!","token_len":597,"entropy":[11.117,1.2225,9.4163,1.4081,5.2838,4.5818,0.1775,3.4731,2.6317,3.9888,0.2122,3.1756,5.3139,5.624,1.1917,2.0437,8.4224,1.0302,7.2168,16.4953,8.7388,8.5301,7.7859,6.6754,1.0234,5.1215,1.9209,9.1511,4.4231,10.7549,1.7514,4.4627,2.5885,0.4145,7.7583,7.8337,0.0263,2.1424,2.7753,0.6444,2.4406,4.5873,0.0124,0.6686,4.7511,1.6085,5.436,0.9517,0.365,1.4883,4.262,4.2166,4.6316,1.5368,3.7991,0.5597,4.6974,1.8386,5.6946,2.9222,5.0828,1.4113,0.8002,3.6036,0.6724,5.645,1.5363,5.8161,4.4691,3.1046,2.7895,6.6107,3.3753,3.8112,4.4025,6.2678,5.4758,0.6308,1.1269,0.0002,4.6026,3.9668,3.0048,4.1073,1.2449,2.4651,4.1907,1.4702,3.2467,4.2098,1.4073,3.8845,0.0007,0.5864,0.0442,0.0707,5.9394,3.3382,3.9028,2.6248,6.0148,4.6894,5.5063,2.8817,1.9647,1.1694,3.6717,0.4467,2.6779,4.1634,6.7862,3.1546,0.2632,5.0981,2.9837,5.1746,4.7011,1.1455,2.5788,2.1232,3.8199,0.5816,3.9306,3.011,4.9968,1.1453,0.8735,4.2071,2.2905,2.957,1.3505,3.9463,4.3112,0.4667,4.847,4.0696,1.4647,3.1138,0.7459,4.0296,0.0235,2.9563,1.3557,0.0302,1.369,5.1709,5.0432,0.7521,0.5238,4.9889,1.1123,4.5636,0.0584,4.5577,0.0097,2.9031,0.012,1.731,2.9669,1.6652,1.265,0.0656,0.6899,5.2148,1.7795,3.1488,0.8417,4.3625,0.1863,1.1642,4.4155,0.6669,1.103,0.0002,5.146,0.5183,2.0876,5.0635,3.0336,0.8206,4.1795,3.8389,2.9662,2.3916,4.4478,4.6544,0.2162,4.7632,4.4685,4.3088,1.7145,0.4447,2.0218,0.9431,1.1081,1.2694,0.7075,0.6568,0.2571,0.2692,0.0001,4.6732,3.522,5.2959,5.9233,1.0372,6.1852,0.8504,4.164,4.1469,2.6214,1.3863,3.3243,0.9906,4.8616,0.5488,0.3351,1.2396,6.0379,3.05,3.2213,4.2252,4.7398,4.9655,4.2587,0.0224,1.5176,3.122,5.9733,5.2285,3.5533,2.4875,5.3544,0.173,3.1897,5.4686,0.8002,1.1557,4.6043,3.0573,0.948,4.2937,0.611,4.0749,3.1334,1.5834,0.1153,1.4692,2.0034,2.7381,3.8105,3.4254,0.1008,3.4857,3.0945,3.0841,0.5004,4.3327,0.3067,2.3281,2.2987,4.3916,4.4408,0.9633,5.6541,3.221,1.0288,3.2263,5.2278,2.6518,0.0713,3.5925,0.5782,0.9579,2.4549,1.4154,3.1213,2.4123,3.339,0.5246,5.0041,0.1524,1.1525,1.9519,2.495,0.4426,0.4861,1.2095,0.0002,0.4674,0.05,4.793,0.9197,1.3872,0.0071,0.3764,1.5281,1.1976,1.3354,0.651,0.9147,4.9332,0.0161,3.8857,5.9629,1.3044,1.401,4.2118,2.0877,0.2926,1.4479,5.0308,2.0785,5.1037,3.9126,4.8911,7.1033,2.0403,2.2966,3.57,5.4978,2.4665,4.3813,3.6335,0.1694,5.9482,4.5411,1.9045,2.1742,2.3392,1.9156,1.474,1.8414,1.4869,3.9746,2.2411,3.5822,5.0725,0.6554,1.7573,5.8306,2.684,1.1768,5.422,2.5458,3.0664,4.9129,5.8903,0.3696,5.9547,2.9642,0.1645,4.6144,3.6579,0.0053,0.0001,0.3876,5.48,0.1109,1.5036,1.2588,0.3016,0.1966,0.1144,0.3349,0.1691,0.3297,0.5972,0.4745,1.2399,3.3882,0.8194,4.9905,1.6491,1.0782,0.6166,1.4484,0.4083,2.451,3.5769,3.2663,0.7989,0.223,3.2309,1.2821,4.7695,0.7521,0.192,1.6554,3.0468,0.4494,0.5834,6.2235,5.4388,1.9157,5.4337,1.8276,0.1624,2.1009,1.0189,0.0045,4.2116,4.0569,0.2197,0.7632,5.0448,3.0519,0.404,2.2988,1.7062,1.307,0.466,0.0196,0.8219,1.0838,0.4353,0.2994,0.0002,0.1211,6.4518,4.2932,1.6212,6.1747,2.6367,4.0742,0.7072,4.8038,3.0613,3.1262,4.84,5.5727,4.773,0.1206,0.4572,4.277,2.9335,1.1893,1.412,0.361,2.0865,5.1685,3.0549,1.4678,4.1475,5.8867,1.7572,0.7309,1.691,2.1767,3.3234,0.0003,4.375,0.0351,0.0566,2.6089,0.5385,2.6428,0.0561,1.4462,2.7205,2.2807,1.3755,3.5683,1.377,2.3608,1.6834,5.6017,5.4468,2.893,1.1566,0.1664,4.7017,1.235,4.2126,0.4202,2.7716,3.2183,1.2285,3.6263,3.5572,0.7512,3.2425,1.3337,1.9393,4.1254,0.2619,3.3376,4.414,4.8313,8.0631,2.9145,4.2211,2.2874,1.1795,1.1184,5.4937,5.2683,2.9938,4.302,3.7635,1.4742,2.9239,0.2658,0.702,5.1888,2.1011,2.4998,1.2735,6.8211,2.7575,4.0899,0.5858,2.6306,2.5671,3.1982,4.277,5.6433,2.9593,0.8997,4.3836,3.1522,5.0465,4.5433,3.2317,0.3212,1.0564,0.9749,1.4312,0.0002,4.4386,1.5935,0.0648,4.1692,0.4072,3.0796,4.4986,3.5865,5.6126,2.3824,0.1283,2.4941,1.4861,4.3387,6.6868,3.7539,6.5027,4.3164,2.949,5.442,1.3547,3.4526,3.2935,5.2507,1.7105,5.0698,4.8459,6.5296,1.7429,4.0975,0.1198,1.5637,3.6215,2.8123,5.249,4.1142,3.4289,1.9729,1.395,0.0338,1.0787,5.7636,2.2106,0.0355,3.7034,3.6085,1.1599,2.2855,0.4345,0.3752,3.2997,1.0549,5.3771,0.361,0.8345,1.2069,1.0551,2.2378,0.1088,3.2558,0.152,0.8645,3.0958,5.1885,0.0994,0.002,5.559]}
{"id":4822,"ended":true,"length":574,"gen_text":"In 2002, the Royal Navy destroyer HMS Nottingham struck Wolf Rock, a reef at Lord Howe Island, and almost sank. In recent times tourism has increased and the government of New Zealand has launched a new tourism campaign. The government says that many of the visits to Wolf Rock have been with family and friends who have paid attention to the site for years. Tourism minister Andrew Leslie said that the government recognised that people have an interest in these marine parks. \"You should not just leave your car in a public park in the middle of nowhere, or at a park. This is a cultural treasure and the park is important to the environment,\" he said. In 2012, The Department of Conservation (DoC) said that there were five large marine parks in New Zealand with an average daily visit of 500,000 people per year. This year's figure is more than twice that of 2008, with 8,000 people per year visiting Great Barrier Reef. The DoC's research shows that the value of these marine parks is far higher than that of a tourist center, which has \u00a320 billion worth of investment.\n\n, a reef at Lord Howe Island, and almost sunk. Last year, there was a $15 million reward for information leading to the arrest of 2,000 members of an anti-biotic industry in Northland. During the 2011-12 financial year, public interest groups, including Greenpeace and WWF, were launched to fight against the development. On the international stage, Greenpeace has launched a campaign to oppose fracking and other projects in Great Barrier Reef. They say that the Government's efforts to protect the Great Barrier Reef are a case of a \"big business and big government doing their best to protect it\". The government has also launched a Global Alliance Against Biodiversity, a partnership between the WWF and the governments of South and Central America, Asia and the Middle East. The WWF announced that it would conduct a feasibility study in the Great Barrier Reef in June this year. On the international stage, Greenpeace will work to ensure the protection of the reef. WWF's conservation adviser, Brian Ewan, is a climate change sceptic. He says: \"In the short term, it is likely that the reef will be closed down for several decades. That will affect its ecosystem and climate change. The potential effects on life on the reef depend on the size and location of the reef and the presence of marine invertebrates. So, if they are being monitored, that's absolutely critical.\" One of the many environmental issues that the Government faces today is the Great Barrier Reef's water, which is so thin it is impervious to most waterborne activities. The scientists at the Great Barrier Reef say they found that there are two things going for the reef today. One is the need for protection of the reef's habitat, like marine invertebrates. In January last year there was news that the reef would be closed for \"potentially several decades\", prompting a \"crisis assessment\".","token_len":598,"entropy":[9.3354,0.2289,1.737,7.5736,3.4627,9.8027,2.0073,8.6362,4.5867,13.0638,5.7847,1.1467,1.8716,5.2416,3.8496,8.1374,1.7636,2.1295,0.8153,2.8303,6.7387,2.8055,2.3569,2.9549,5.9474,4.6213,11.4175,0.5232,1.9762,2.3611,1.7591,4.9602,3.6655,2.8786,0.0449,0.4008,3.6762,0.8731,2.3798,2.5229,2.3682,1.4946,2.6582,2.0652,2.8959,1.9434,5.1348,1.4278,0.4838,5.8228,1.7719,1.2308,0.003,2.8724,0.4625,5.5862,2.7524,0.9327,0.0397,2.429,1.1948,4.8808,5.0301,0.227,0.3938,2.6082,3.1945,1.4607,0.2819,5.4954,4.1651,4.4592,5.3092,1.3886,1.4258,1.7837,1.7586,5.8149,1.0535,3.7569,4.1571,3.385,0.3371,0.0773,4.5842,4.6646,2.5917,1.1892,1.1831,4.4067,4.4881,1.9687,3.1322,3.976,1.9597,3.7353,1.7958,1.8626,4.8895,1.0867,4.0063,1.4154,0.3899,0.0041,0.9798,1.7585,2.9979,3.9308,1.1717,2.9979,3.7566,3.2749,0.4667,1.3009,4.8648,3.6098,1.6795,3.3696,5.1607,1.4394,3.3656,0.6519,1.9519,4.2197,1.1013,0.3308,0.1475,0.1118,3.8873,3.2299,0.4093,5.1099,5.6741,0.1649,1.8591,3.5549,1.9488,0.0968,0.0213,3.0994,0.536,2.9504,0.8085,5.0797,5.0621,1.2104,0.5951,0.5991,0.5,0.0041,3.5886,2.3259,1.6788,4.2966,4.3432,0.1805,4.6573,2.2462,0.0492,1.0503,2.4411,0.2351,0.2847,3.9898,1.9851,2.7354,3.4289,1.2644,3.8548,0.066,2.1478,1.3079,0.6974,3.2175,1.0177,3.233,5.4653,1.1611,1.1007,0.589,2.2368,0.3719,1.4362,5.8289,0.4983,0.0168,0.6272,1.9013,1.6448,0.003,3.1695,4.3757,1.9033,0.1208,1.7039,5.1086,0.0645,2.3117,0.5826,0.1666,1.0643,3.8433,1.3884,0.0752,2.2204,0.1672,3.8068,3.1507,5.6586,1.7967,2.0907,2.7561,5.6844,3.6589,1.3622,2.2974,0.0216,2.9125,1.1402,2.4843,0.0109,8.9137,2.4993,4.6726,0.7949,0.0286,0.0064,0.035,0.211,0.0461,0.0193,1.8663,0.079,5.112,0.2988,0.4351,4.4498,1.4632,0.618,5.0009,4.2437,0.8055,5.0078,0.4591,0.499,0.2291,0.0258,0.6723,0.4978,0.3661,6.4914,0.5934,1.0912,5.5775,0.0167,3.025,3.3861,0.0025,4.7195,3.4296,4.8717,2.6072,4.4801,2.7923,0.7412,5.375,0.6587,4.4396,1.4173,0.3718,1.0657,0.0218,0.2468,6.0415,2.5518,0.7174,3.189,1.0927,2.8291,1.3053,4.2059,0.5962,2.931,4.7596,0.8044,2.6987,1.7394,0.8304,4.731,2.3363,4.3065,2.1902,5.1829,1.6761,0.1753,4.6371,1.3986,2.8332,0.7396,0.9986,1.0441,4.548,4.2175,1.7227,2.723,4.6027,1.1718,6.1098,0.0189,0.0064,0.514,4.4476,1.9235,0.5717,1.4036,4.4888,1.6311,4.1651,0.4143,2.3801,0.7222,2.0767,0.003,0.004,1.1943,2.8894,5.3208,0.7194,3.4812,2.0448,4.4107,3.1047,4.0384,1.3737,0.9701,5.0318,2.0557,1.9759,0.2846,1.1886,1.8701,0.5756,2.022,2.1319,1.4027,1.4554,2.1882,0.6235,5.7483,4.9153,1.5117,2.3301,0.5637,0.0058,1.744,2.0545,4.6879,0.9603,1.2263,2.1171,0.418,1.0921,5.9231,0.0681,3.3647,4.4243,0.8987,0.1496,1.0694,3.0219,0.7546,0.7933,1.6572,0.005,0.4715,1.4813,2.2587,6.0134,1.7495,0.6498,1.0235,5.2947,0.6253,5.5348,0.0316,2.5829,1.8596,1.1089,0.0041,0.0034,1.4863,3.3392,2.7043,0.0012,0.5427,4.1349,1.4665,1.7121,0.38,0.0701,1.9652,5.7607,4.2055,1.6419,3.7417,2.5667,2.398,0.0613,0.6593,2.1913,1.5317,4.0919,2.1117,5.6201,4.2331,0.7179,5.1141,5.7977,3.8106,0.2821,3.4683,2.2745,5.5492,0.7051,1.9737,0.009,1.1155,0.938,1.658,2.512,0.049,3.9896,1.2938,4.1129,0.2164,0.4856,2.4934,1.334,2.8465,0.3186,1.2331,2.1419,0.3656,1.6946,4.51,1.4905,2.4087,3.3434,1.359,1.2661,3.6804,2.0629,4.5111,4.0261,3.0778,1.291,5.1724,1.6867,1.2346,2.1359,5.3099,4.36,1.5614,4.4876,0.6918,0.5172,0.351,4.3036,0.332,1.1386,3.3171,1.2807,2.7009,0.1106,0.3434,0.8984,1.5464,1.0986,5.0169,0.1719,2.8392,4.7888,0.0001,0.1059,1.4043,4.4036,1.9561,2.359,4.0809,0.9958,5.0765,4.3267,1.1995,3.3052,2.747,6.0573,1.3417,1.219,5.8694,0.722,0.5197,5.139,2.9218,1.8469,1.3594,1.7004,1.7185,2.1278,4.1549,0.1933,0.6813,5.531,0.0037,0.007,1.3285,4.7511,4.2504,0.8568,0.6869,3.9954,5.4046,1.5483,1.0535,4.3357,0.6326,0.0367,4.3727,3.216,4.4952,5.6431,0.3769,1.4814,5.6597,2.1216,0.5551,4.2378,0.0099,0.0042,2.6854,3.1398,5.6952,1.1678,3.5115,1.3147,3.2374,4.8135,2.4883,4.1165,0.4749,0.2887,2.692,1.0201,1.7506,0.2392,1.6341,5.3935,0.6184,4.4882,1.4041,0.573,0.8859,1.5308,3.9413,1.4019,4.4203,5.2257,1.8964,0.0012,0.0741,1.2684,3.6863,5.7243,3.234,0.0013,5.0781,0.5766,5.2428,0.4458,1.2361,2.6874,2.9583,0.4308,1.0963,1.6161,5.463,5.6126,0.1819,3.8361,0.7891,1.8972,5.6963,2.1757,4.3215,4.3415,0.4888,3.751,1.7586]}

Its main tank has a three-piston cam, a 12 gauge gas tank and a gas filler that is fully adjustable. It has two 5.25 inch and 3.15 inch main and four 5.25 inch cylinder doors where the air compressor is located. The three 6 foot deep ( 7 \/ \/. 10 m ) air engine has a hydraulic drive system and a 3.5 mile ( 1 9 \/ \/. 13 m ) long chain drive. A 5 s @ - @ \/ @ @ 1\/2 s (5 \/ 4 m ) four passenger port door valve is installed on this little ship and provides a convenient way to transfer your water, fuel and luggage. The cargo door on the ship has an adjustable lock and also has five 2 foot ( 4 \/ \/ s ) water pump mounted inside. This tank uses the T-90 motor with which the deck was built and can be installed.\n\n\nThe ship has three main compartment lock-free doors. The door on the back where the port side of the ship meets the ship also has two lock-free doors so that the passenger is protected from light movement. The passenger compartment has two 3\/4 inch ( 4 \/ 6 m ) main and two 6 foot ( 4 \/ 7 \/ s ) cylinder doors with additional internal slots that can be secured with a 1\/2-inch ( 0.8 m ) double lock locking bracket. The compartment is covered with the T-60 motor on this engine, which allows for easy shifting with ease at the rear. The engine is equipped with a water pump that acts as a reservoir if needed and provides high pressure air for easy loading.\n\n\nThese cruise deck steam engine types (2.0 hp or 3.6 hp) and passenger port can only be used with the T-90 engine, for which the T-90 engine was built and built with the exception of the one built for the United States Navy where it did not have a reciprocating engine (or engine that operated reciprocated only a 1\/2) in this vessel. When installed in the deck, the 3.5 inch ( 2 \/8 m ) steam valve opens and allows water to enter the port side of the large ship. When operating this system on the ship with this engine installed, the oil pressure of the ship is increased to make this engine work with larger cylinders.\n\n\nThe T-90 engine is quite similar to the T-60 engine with its engine being able to operate a two-stage hydraulic drive system and a 3.5 foot ( 4 \/ 8 m ) long chain drive making this engine one of the biggest diesel diesel-powered vehicles on the planet.","token_len":598,"entropy":[8.6648,3.5662,2.6039,5.1466,7.2571,14.281,6.9793,4.6902,9.7774,10.1518,11.6923,1.0651,7.6156,1.2613,6.7998,8.2715,2.8818,6.4652,11.8947,1.3424,3.7041,6.504,4.862,1.4543,0.3929,7.9346,5.5039,8.4814,5.8865,5.2533,6.6283,5.8068,4.9839,3.5449,2.3865,6.2875,3.3371,3.8947,3.5279,6.5007,2.8625,0.1576,2.1999,5.7972,2.7835,1.9614,4.1081,2.567,0.8947,3.711,2.9067,3.4165,0.8332,0.5361,0.5917,3.1874,0.4486,0.3402,5.9418,0.8428,0.8487,5.1605,3.0449,4.7035,4.8548,0.9607,5.8256,1.7191,4.5889,0.4935,4.1771,2.8228,1.9727,4.2094,3.8371,3.5563,1.163,1.0128,0.6671,4.4442,4.4488,4.4769,1.5466,4.6102,1.9326,0.8672,2.222,1.1641,2.8003,4.7526,1.5257,1.8517,2.4161,4.7799,2.9447,1.1015,5.6103,0.0312,5.0173,2.455,3.2228,1.968,0.7049,0.4721,0.0276,5.3676,5.7445,7.4735,0.8813,5.3929,4.4726,1.4375,0.9831,0.3733,1.0793,5.7184,3.7959,3.105,5.2554,3.3731,3.4239,2.7981,3.8966,4.6541,4.6936,0.248,0.1595,5.0708,5.5931,2.6049,0.691,5.4395,3.7664,2.1742,1.8056,1.2344,4.033,1.0356,0.7425,5.3511,0.8355,4.3853,6.0264,0.447,2.6488,0.6054,3.2622,0.0975,0.0818,4.7061,5.4512,2.0431,0.9865,3.4791,4.0065,6.8196,3.9142,0.9318,0.1276,1.4762,0.3826,1.4239,1.1778,0.1344,0.1865,0.3966,0.3452,3.9356,0.4728,3.6661,0.09,0.0906,5.7403,6.1711,5.8433,4.6456,5.5487,1.4974,3.0786,2.1703,3.8092,5.5702,2.2123,2.4883,4.4936,1.4229,5.037,1.9414,0.2174,4.8311,3.1351,4.3147,3.0058,1.8938,0.9865,4.728,1.1873,1.3537,4.6692,4.6433,4.06,0.855,2.3158,1.5089,2.6882,2.2974,3.9806,2.0968,5.5278,1.1599,6.5927,4.156,1.9828,1.099,2.4371,0.4439,2.697,5.0525,0.1398,4.9504,2.7166,3.8715,3.898,1.0496,2.7226,5.8635,5.679,2.8623,6.0359,2.5252,4.9164,4.4802,2.921,5.223,1.2602,5.5357,2.5009,0.6819,1.7531,3.6159,0.6587,3.7717,3.2134,4.4061,0.0005,1.3086,2.5479,1.2593,3.5504,3.0491,5.0122,5.1928,3.6209,5.4007,1.483,1.9608,0.9307,2.7666,2.4011,0.093,3.2574,6.0565,0.5913,4.9913,2.1866,1.9434,0.0693,0.916,3.4823,0.4924,4.0182,5.2953,0.2761,2.7417,2.3679,0.928,0.2029,0.4284,4.9914,0.8529,1.7312,4.3111,4.3768,3.0157,0.6662,5.9118,5.6577,0.9984,0.7839,4.1495,0.9599,1.8002,1.9924,4.2548,3.5445,0.6011,0.6027,0.7351,2.535,0.0811,4.405,0.4798,0.0377,5.5892,1.273,0.865,1.9508,0.5663,0.7646,1.2092,0.0115,2.7008,2.2277,1.2257,0.0378,2.0018,0.3407,2.5719,5.88,5.7029,6.3153,3.1562,1.815,0.3648,4.5332,1.901,1.2468,4.0251,0.8061,0.6927,4.0342,0.0993,0.6485,3.5324,0.6089,2.7222,0.4263,0.0599,5.3463,2.6943,5.6205,5.1364,0.3124,0.7038,3.2854,2.6079,4.4971,0.7945,4.4208,3.1146,0.0849,4.1678,2.6783,5.2547,2.1979,4.8931,2.5351,1.0222,3.2798,1.9989,2.512,5.6156,3.9299,2.4523,5.6346,1.9409,4.2314,1.4692,0.8046,2.6371,1.3996,2.703,0.0082,0.8105,6.0075,0.7746,1.8825,5.7987,0.1818,0.3518,3.526,5.8023,2.7096,2.1233,3.3234,4.9738,1.1501,3.2526,1.6695,4.5949,3.7432,1.4007,1.7463,0.0003,5.5078,6.0317,5.9235,5.8371,2.5786,5.2341,5.0329,4.6337,1.7199,1.8488,4.0235,4.5046,2.125,0.2691,2.7158,0.7767,0.4583,4.1024,5.1325,2.608,5.4358,4.3049,0.166,1.4301,1.4941,1.4697,1.096,0.0699,0.5452,2.6385,2.672,5.0889,2.065,1.2599,2.3841,0.0544,0.6211,2.2804,3.4297,1.3844,2.0566,3.4159,2.123,1.4734,5.1987,0.0314,0.5721,4.8308,1.9384,1.7244,0.7504,5.3487,0.1125,0.6093,5.0852,1.5007,5.3434,0.0393,1.2393,1.1141,5.6234,0.0734,1.6598,3.4687,4.8639,4.3468,2.5291,4.5395,3.5474,2.0233,4.1085,4.3025,4.432,1.1089,0.5193,5.6448,3.6111,3.6446,2.6655,0.2174,5.0004,4.9327,1.9777,1.3565,3.1464,1.2843,0.5845,5.7235,0.2812,0.5613,1.0525,0.3698,2.4103,0.406,5.1052,0.1096,0.0642,5.018,3.6652,4.5658,1.51,3.1239,3.8786,0.3421,1.959,0.8298,2.2205,0.4182,1.1066,0.0505,6.6119,2.8715,1.0253,2.4939,4.5475,2.5049,3.921,3.0923,0.6772,2.5236,4.6894,3.8654,0.9088,1.6407,0.3308,0.619,5.8921,1.0649,2.3939,0.1894,2.5618,1.1096,2.7526,1.9673,5.3201,3.4238,1.953,2.8397,2.4325,5.3347,5.6529,1.0979,1.9307,0.0004,1.1168,1.5203,0.0112,0.2719,1.0697,1.392,6.0665,3.3437,0.197,0.4536,1.0154,0.0961,1.5045,0.8729,3.6531,2.4685,4.0103,3.2467,4.0557,0.0045,1.2045,2.883,4.4612,1.6792,3.7758,5.2801,0.7847,0.4243,1.8214,0.994,2.0221,0.2331,0.1237,2.6581,0.3889,1.5011,0.0179,2.0034,0.0482,0.0438,0.4747,0.2825,0.0359,7.1287,2.1118,0.7009,4.5735,0.0379,0.0536,5.0629,3.6829,2.5759,4.7962,0.7915,4.4102,1.4447,0.2057,1.2222,0.1783]}
{"id":3669,"ended":true,"length":531,"gen_text":"The novel is not about the fight between good and evil but rather the differences between madness and reason \u2014 and it is the fairy world that is connected to madness ( mad people can find it difficult to distinguish between the true evil of their dreams and the true evil of their lives.)\n\nThis novel also makes the reader feel for the true evil of the story, while not necessarily as bad as the other books in that genre. The book begins right at the end after the book is cut to see what this will bring.\n\nThe story begins with a small town called Lufy. Lufy's town is being attacked by thieves with the purpose of stealing more than one of its own.\n\nIt's a place where thieves are known to kidnap children\u2014 the youngest of which is called Albertson. Lufy, along with a small group of his people, is trying to kidnap Albertson, but it's found out that they can and are willing to ransom them. It's there that the thief sets about the capture of a child called Lufy.\n\nLufy is found, and given a ransom of a small sum, he decides not to go back to the town, and after Lufy is taken, there's no telling what happens next.\n\nIn the first chapter, the thief comes back (with the rest of Lufy's people) and offers Lufy money, but Lufy refused. That's what happened next. The thief had planned on stealing Albertson that day as well, and after being kidnapped Lufy gets away and leaves.\n\nIn the second chapter, the thief takes Lufy's place and kidnaps the rest of his people.\n\nIt makes this story a lot more serious at the beginning, as it all begins very suddenly. The thief turns into a monster called Albertson. He takes Lufy's people and then the rest of the city. They all take the rest out anyway, but this one day one of the children was given a ransom, so they leave.\n\nAlso in this story, Lufy was captured by a group of bandits who wanted the girl to be their king. In Lufy's story, they take the princess, who was captured and tried as an adult. When they get out of Lufy's tale, he gets killed by a monster, the one who captured her. One of the bandits then takes the girl out of her misery, taking her and giving her, along with her, some of their gold for this attack.\n\nThe girl named Lavernette gets back to Lufy after that and so has more time to escape the bandit hunters.\n\nYou can read all of the endings from this story here (except for the end where the narrator asks the reader to choose their \"Ending,\" not including the endings of the original novel).","token_len":598,"entropy":[9.4847,1.7702,3.9753,2.0604,1.5813,7.0833,1.861,5.1424,0.1657,0.055,3.0889,2.0211,1.7953,6.6113,0.284,9.9475,0.091,5.7493,5.9931,2.3656,2.9644,1.495,3.0197,9.6811,6.3026,1.1691,1.9135,7.7251,0.3494,3.1327,5.3787,15.9781,6.0475,3.5382,5.6679,2.7944,2.6172,0.1151,4.0594,0.5185,2.5272,4.9445,2.542,1.6227,2.6027,5.1079,0.216,0.5322,1.7285,0.5883,0.1118,0.2906,2.2498,4.2355,1.0651,0.0021,3.4756,3.1701,3.8099,4.3583,2.4667,2.7515,2.238,3.3332,0.9751,5.5075,2.4303,0.5683,1.3273,4.3069,1.3514,4.6528,3.3322,3.1594,5.4424,3.8356,0.1074,1.0633,3.5417,1.7117,1.156,3.6108,1.9856,0.33,2.0651,3.152,3.7727,6.7975,1.3406,0.1284,1.446,6.4133,1.1421,4.3133,1.8663,5.5919,2.8689,5.637,2.2789,5.0397,4.2772,3.1934,1.9711,1.6028,0.0002,1.9061,3.1767,2.2038,0.7812,1.3236,4.7182,2.5116,1.4364,4.8721,5.2145,5.1357,2.4721,2.5764,0.0044,0.0027,2.8544,3.2896,0.6518,5.1353,2.751,0.1313,5.6114,4.5635,2.0888,3.4825,0.031,0.9972,5.4204,2.2606,2.745,2.6021,1.0155,2.7612,1.3178,2.6023,0.0002,3.5261,1.4377,1.6637,3.9138,1.0807,3.8474,2.1524,2.5176,0.8245,4.5135,1.3084,7.1749,5.2679,4.3797,1.1686,1.8113,0.3126,3.1197,5.5622,5.289,2.8346,1.9899,0.5194,3.2772,0.0112,0.0044,3.9618,3.2415,0.0024,2.4379,2.5978,1.5312,0.0104,5.3734,2.736,0.284,2.4884,3.524,0.0315,5.5688,1.1527,0.0117,0.0012,0.0028,2.0395,1.4092,2.7522,1.0625,5.8868,1.2184,0.4427,2.3575,3.8497,6.2664,2.068,3.8547,0.0262,5.4186,3.1596,0.5885,3.5462,0.5966,4.9669,0.4242,1.1902,3.2862,4.5392,3.3,4.2901,5.3853,0.2175,2.6747,3.12,3.2736,4.0232,0.5656,0.0538,0.8171,0.5988,0.0002,2.1055,0.0381,0.0052,1.1209,4.904,2.7974,1.1379,5.5798,1.2965,4.775,2.751,2.9594,3.1228,2.7979,0.8283,0.763,3.613,5.3564,0.0034,2.1075,2.3335,0.5848,1.6923,0.6126,2.0994,1.9717,4.387,5.227,0.0182,0.0079,1.9395,2.2965,1.417,5.0805,1.053,2.2807,3.6028,0.7715,2.3577,1.0644,0.1581,1.0167,0.0002,2.8961,0.8727,3.7382,1.6063,0.5423,1.6143,2.3781,4.7148,2.2744,6.5687,2.7915,1.7377,5.008,0.0783,3.1975,0.002,0.006,0.2818,0.6857,0.8454,0.8209,4.0873,2.397,0.0022,0.0071,3.3363,1.999,1.416,0.7647,0.0024,0.0025,5.2205,1.3443,5.1615,0.8669,3.707,2.8745,2.1048,0.6526,1.9621,0.9092,3.9601,4.3855,1.9736,2.6987,1.5609,0.0022,0.0012,0.0018,6.5137,1.1707,4.1242,0.1381,0.6034,1.3846,3.8363,3.5361,2.7858,3.6199,0.0036,0.0063,5.2163,4.6195,2.4536,3.4196,1.4866,0.6177,0.0002,1.9608,0.266,0.705,0.134,0.1104,1.2254,0.5424,3.7268,1.163,0.004,0.0068,1.2944,4.2162,1.7767,2.1386,0.0032,2.7343,2.8261,0.0564,1.5565,0.135,0.5375,1.546,0.0002,3.5153,4.9479,4.2553,2.2059,2.365,1.8283,0.5409,6.0823,5.8815,0.8883,1.4577,1.1653,2.0181,1.6401,5.5509,2.7314,4.8437,3.4377,1.2486,1.8105,1.4092,5.2049,1.7229,0.468,2.3937,4.5509,2.9774,0.0797,0.007,0.0067,1.9572,2.2499,3.5917,1.4001,0.0023,0.0047,0.9212,2.0858,1.1455,3.9048,4.093,0.8058,0.2015,0.799,3.3149,1.4607,3.9478,2.2106,4.4561,2.6777,4.3088,5.5243,6.6003,0.6416,1.6707,3.8872,3.8636,5.1259,5.411,0.2502,1.0891,3.5235,3.8277,5.601,1.1619,2.1007,2.4502,2.0051,1.8834,3.5254,1.0478,0.6826,0.0002,5.9838,1.4407,1.0102,0.8651,0.3109,2.2008,0.019,0.0067,4.4479,4.8879,0.9847,1.8167,1.6673,0.0992,3.019,2.0341,2.4096,3.6565,4.8965,1.787,1.3547,1.8734,3.9896,0.3987,3.9306,3.9448,0.019,0.0043,0.0557,2.3247,0.267,2.4018,3.356,1.4677,2.9265,1.9583,2.4419,2.0074,4.2633,2.3821,4.3877,3.1002,1.7045,0.4432,1.1497,4.1591,1.4149,2.8089,2.931,0.6177,2.8964,0.0043,0.0069,0.0219,5.6907,0.221,2.2913,3.4701,4.0748,0.8915,1.5632,3.792,2.7006,3.8444,3.5306,1.3125,5.4579,2.2228,0.5433,6.0376,0.7755,0.3996,0.806,3.0333,2.3267,1.5233,1.8139,2.6828,1.1363,2.1766,4.8738,1.4369,5.1452,0.371,2.8293,3.6389,0.2564,6.9866,2.4929,0.0028,1.522,1.9601,4.4082,1.9808,2.9327,3.7504,5.1645,6.124,5.8855,0.25,0.5222,0.0002,1.893,4.5499,5.5825,6.0725,5.7408,5.204,3.6071,4.6934,1.1825,1.3698,0.0032,0.0041,2.4633,3.2123,2.4658,5.6237,4.6349,4.6142,3.1415,0.5379,3.5837,2.1422,5.8269,0.0673,4.959,0.6234,1.1384,0.0002,5.6138,0.7018,1.0125,2.7822,1.1682,0.8283,5.8945,3.2621,0.6979,2.2428,1.0633,3.7447,3.9096,0.6127,0.534,3.4392,1.6593,1.3477,4.2868,4.2831,1.8861,1.2967,0.65,2.734,3.204,4.4572,4.6662,2.9758,3.5086,4.9405,6.506,0.6546,3.5102,1.9648,0.5702,4.6166,2.7749,0.8302]}
{"id":4769,"ended":true,"length":558,"gen_text":"Several critics theorized about the effects of the shift from scarcity to abundance of written material in the media as a result of the technologies introduced by the Internet. This shift was examined for the first time in the book by Christopher Shaver and Andrew B. Brown\n\nThe book is intended to make possible for readers the development and advancement of digital communications. It also proposes a new medium as a means of communicating with one another.\n\nShaver said of the internet: [T]here is a big gap between information and media. We have to put people at the bottom of the pile. We have to do some better work. The Internet becomes so important that people who can afford it will be able to do much better for it than we are. If we get this right, what we want may be more valuable than our own interests.\n\nHere's the big takeaway from our research: One of the things we found in the recent book, \" How Technology Can Transform and Expand the World \", was that, as Shaver wrote:\n\nOur work demonstrates that online news reporting can be very positive for the lives of millions of people, while at the same time reducing the negative impact that media can have on people who can afford it.\n\nWe went on to use this opportunity to suggest a new new way to understand the changes in the technology landscape which will impact on the lives of millions of people.\n\nThe Internet is an alternative to the mass mailing lists and mail order lists we were talking about today. We think it makes perfect sense because it enables more people as they find more important items that can communicate with each other like a real-time web-based email address.\n\nShaver said he has \"a lot of experience writing articles on technology, so I think this book is going to help me solve that problem, which is where we are today in terms of people paying attention to what is going on in the news.\n\nThe book is about the way we can build the infrastructure to take the Internet out of poverty where it's so important to people. And it may be just the beginning for technology.\n\nOn the subject of sharing, it was said Shaver:\n\nSocial networks can allow you to share information that is shared with others, so that we can better understand our common experiences and share those experiences with people we know.\n\nShaver's plan is to share information with the world through a service like Twitter. On Twitter, we can send updates through our API to anyone who likes our content.\n\nThese new, higher-quality news feeds can be shared for free in the comments section of the news feed.\n\nShaver said that there are two things we plan to do to encourage our audience \u2014 to allow them to post to this online platform for a short time, or to share these newsfeeds where they can see and hear what's going on behind the scenes, and that's more personal communication.","token_len":599,"entropy":[9.4929,9.3473,1.3689,4.7253,1.2031,5.7264,0.1814,2.0088,6.3304,2.0274,9.3427,0.2283,2.1707,3.4391,9.4918,1.515,2.6981,1.1103,5.7532,4.0541,1.2882,1.142,0.1201,0.9064,9.4034,5.5379,1.7583,1.1043,2.3246,0.5567,4.0424,3.6103,2.4268,7.4893,4.3294,1.6455,0.3036,0.0026,0.8909,1.4128,3.1292,2.9244,5.4089,6.0991,3.9433,1.7629,4.4397,4.6584,2.0222,4.7892,6.3148,0.0047,1.8864,1.784,2.5725,5.2779,0.4098,4.8653,4.852,3.6924,2.5768,2.5671,3.7049,2.3045,5.0431,0.0274,1.9987,3.8036,2.2789,1.4023,2.6875,4.5989,1.4598,1.5019,4.0166,4.7938,0.6471,0.9388,0.5745,2.8784,1.7181,2.7036,1.0758,1.291,1.1577,0.0003,3.3006,0.0097,3.9927,4.7184,0.4205,5.7405,1.2686,7.5308,2.7324,0.0129,2.1228,0.6921,1.1142,5.2588,2.8475,0.6867,4.4003,0.9953,4.0701,1.129,2.4785,1.7203,1.6533,4.6626,4.0918,2.9406,0.8884,4.23,0.4643,0.5538,3.1562,1.3758,1.7522,0.5571,0.0827,4.1313,3.9997,5.2369,2.3011,1.8385,2.8155,2.8694,6.1974,3.6859,2.1442,1.4469,2.4751,3.7517,3.6513,2.7684,1.161,2.3714,2.0861,0.4959,0.003,2.2888,3.7145,0.4367,5.5317,1.7782,1.271,2.4641,2.1178,0.8488,4.2261,1.322,4.5221,3.8328,1.4886,0.3457,4.6055,1.2792,3.3418,6.4519,1.1567,3.6652,3.5634,0.4885,3.9369,2.338,4.9076,0.5526,0.8014,0.0002,6.2526,1.5832,1.5693,4.8928,2.0677,0.8433,5.5788,2.1991,0.4692,6.0758,0.8449,0.042,2.8946,1.3027,1.1093,1.9326,0.8336,6.6122,2.1583,3.1026,1.7433,8.6553,3.24,2.4748,3.0167,5.4288,4.1449,1.0167,0.9673,4.9451,1.3059,0.2555,3.9007,2.6273,3.9203,0.0032,2.9137,1.8066,0.4936,0.0003,4.5642,3.0799,4.044,0.4689,5.5343,4.3073,5.1847,1.5948,1.3867,3.6913,5.7705,0.9418,1.7165,3.4745,0.0399,2.7039,0.2225,0.219,1.8518,4.1833,2.2354,0.0054,0.0059,0.0012,4.2589,0.8307,4.1953,0.8631,2.4273,3.1194,2.0286,0.0602,0.1428,2.4894,3.77,3.0555,1.6611,0.5463,0.2387,1.0264,0.0003,2.9435,5.7176,2.0094,0.0373,5.6141,2.2767,4.9258,0.1238,4.7031,2.2139,1.0914,6.0743,2.2426,1.1124,4.1972,1.2867,5.2024,1.7664,1.3181,5.2448,2.6576,5.0537,2.0513,3.1413,3.9719,1.3999,0.8561,0.0382,0.9504,0.2024,0.1592,0.8816,0.5907,0.0002,2.3075,4.3299,1.6772,3.3291,5.4288,0.7508,1.6831,4.4264,5.6245,1.2661,1.5058,5.9562,0.9182,3.6158,3.4493,4.2946,3.4075,0.0092,4.2927,0.4305,2.4069,3.2411,1.7284,4.5558,5.9975,0.019,4.1041,0.8618,3.1188,4.0707,0.3141,7.9129,2.3383,4.3123,3.4569,5.1314,4.9362,3.3001,2.224,6.6357,0.9525,1.0152,0.0149,6.8468,2.9818,4.0803,1.77,0.6416,4.9442,3.8896,0.8935,2.8668,2.8692,0.7771,0.5003,0.0002,2.2326,0.017,2.0067,3.5967,3.6482,3.5232,3.0444,1.3978,0.1992,4.2616,4.3592,4.2927,1.8934,2.9678,2.5166,3.2534,0.6853,1.9423,2.0111,1.3821,0.9551,1.9619,0.0094,1.9455,2.0413,5.7824,1.0938,0.6061,3.5319,2.5065,0.2819,5.1482,2.0134,1.5749,2.2275,3.6167,1.195,0.0015,4.538,5.6582,0.9728,0.3645,2.0417,1.5871,1.5248,0.0228,1.0781,0.6242,2.7057,1.8144,1.1608,0.0001,2.6367,1.4638,1.4931,2.8438,1.7088,4.2175,2.0903,1.7449,3.9479,2.8024,4.1207,1.565,4.534,2.0726,1.661,3.0217,0.0209,6.4596,5.6974,0.5035,2.3988,2.7005,1.261,1.2373,1.8023,0.7478,3.8514,1.6235,4.9176,1.5009,3.9491,0.8978,0.6856,3.694,4.8377,1.2307,0.4838,0.0002,5.43,1.1433,3.2989,0.0281,6.1034,1.3889,4.5356,1.8103,2.9712,2.207,0.0043,2.2596,0.178,0.0001,5.8018,2.7652,2.6747,5.0891,3.0691,0.0568,0.9557,1.9508,3.248,1.7059,3.1918,1.7916,1.6919,1.6888,3.364,1.4595,3.0182,0.3554,2.7703,0.6822,2.887,5.1666,3.5526,1.3154,2.7558,2.2702,0.5839,0.7205,2.4714,3.3018,1.5919,0.9461,0.7134,0.0001,1.5,0.0126,2.58,5.6792,0.8592,0.4643,3.7788,2.3513,2.2975,2.611,1.6769,2.0983,2.3664,4.5504,2.32,2.2912,1.5143,5.599,1.7453,0.3335,3.11,2.3362,3.4045,4.9899,3.9577,2.3303,4.7204,2.4888,3.971,1.0412,2.9571,1.7851,1.7283,0.6983,0.8364,0.0001,6.0483,3.4908,5.457,5.3403,0.3397,1.1894,2.8763,2.4474,2.273,0.8022,1.1735,4.0951,1.0026,3.4978,1.712,4.6616,0.6616,0.4458,1.6183,2.4764,0.8805,0.8896,1.1344,0.0002,1.1547,0.0098,0.8933,2.1115,4.0214,1.0358,3.0501,3.3655,2.5248,5.1947,0.266,0.6407,2.0125,4.3913,4.6588,3.619,7.2453,2.4619,5.0212,1.2486,0.0537,4.0982,3.6076,4.6002,5.1844,2.6565,3.8051,2.8245,2.9743,1.192,1.464,3.4874,0.3574,2.161,4.9494,2.2761,2.5184,0.057,5.6355,0.7576,0.3919,2.5875,3.2918,2.2478,1.9641,1.6749,1.0384,0.0063,5.267,0.0883,0.0318,2.6578,1.8069,3.518,1.4781,5.8273,4.7901,4.9967,0.5159]}
{"id":1940,"ended":true,"length":546,"gen_text":"Mosley was elected to his third term as president of the FIA in 2001. From 2000, Formula One saw the return of teams partly or wholly owned and operated by major motor manufacturers, and its success in Formula One has been matched only by the growth of professional sport in Britain.\n\nWith its massive international reach, F1 has provided for numerous innovations in the art of producing and transporting cars into competitive environments. The FIA is now attempting to do just that. In January 2016, the International Automobile Association will host a second edition of the International Automobile World Championship, with the aim of improving the industry's image and reputation. The FIA will now use the opportunity of this event to review and develop a better understanding of how it can enhance competition in our industry.\n\nThe FIA will use this opportunity to:\n\n\u00b7 Improve the standards of drivers\n\n\u00b7 Provide opportunities for innovative innovations\n\n\u00b7 Make sure that drivers have a fair chance to win\n\n\u00b7 Develop new laws and regulations relating to driver behaviour\n\n\u00b7 Improve driver behaviour by increasing safety options\n\nThe FIA has previously used the opportunity to use the International Auto Association for a review of the rules of the FIA for the next three years. These changes will be made publicly through the FIA's Competition Monitor.\n\nAt the next FIA International Championship held in 2019 in Qatar, the technical level (EIC) of F1 will be reviewed. However, further changes will require the FIA to take further action to provide drivers with the opportunity to compete for a place in the world championship. For that reason as well, the FIA will begin issuing driver testing guidelines this year for driver-run and qualifying vehicles. It continues to take additional further steps to ensure that drivers can play a part in F1.\n\nThis year, IMA President and general manager Jim Pardew held a very public meeting in Abu Dhabi outlining what could be done to help F1 fans in the UK. I said that F1 can now become a global sporting event; it could be the source of opportunities for fans and sport leaders alike alike. And this is an extremely important step. The IMA has already committed over \u00a3250,000 towards the implementation of the 2018 FIA Technical Level of F1, and its aim will be to increase the overall experience of motor sport by more than 80%. The FIA will focus on implementing these action plans further in the year ahead. This means that all drivers and drivers will now have the chance to test their skills and learn from F1 in a competitive environment. Furthermore, these actions will, in turn, help ensure F1 becomes a better place to play.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about this announcement, please visit the IMA's website (www.ihm.org.uk).\n\nDavid Walker is FIA Executive Director.\n\nThis version of this news article incorporates material from the FIA's \"Rules for the Future\" report published on 28 April 2016.","token_len":599,"entropy":[6.5261,3.5757,5.6829,1.3508,2.8786,2.5543,0.0843,2.0147,3.4696,1.8704,0.3705,10.7739,1.2443,3.8243,0.7762,6.2378,3.5879,3.4988,7.0913,0.5403,5.0331,2.5368,3.3263,0.0403,7.5382,11.2077,4.8878,1.0919,1.2101,4.0284,0.8801,0.0319,6.7852,6.2219,1.1023,1.6693,2.2897,4.1863,3.6811,2.2669,4.3247,0.3071,3.0049,1.3778,5.0315,1.5185,0.0531,1.1094,4.8044,0.2129,5.3436,2.8166,1.0133,3.1548,0.6218,0.7589,0.0006,4.3705,2.8463,5.2511,4.7464,3.5932,0.4682,3.3796,0.0068,1.0546,4.4763,4.3611,5.1292,4.5494,1.6048,1.5882,5.5527,0.1641,5.1585,1.6443,4.2604,1.161,6.6016,6.2718,3.9551,0.6721,2.1105,3.9628,2.8676,2.1396,5.2473,0.0572,4.7099,0.6357,0.1782,1.6337,2.9817,4.0243,2.4817,0.276,0.9131,3.8406,1.334,0.02,0.8433,2.976,2.2919,0.9921,5.051,3.5952,0.0637,0.4971,2.9807,1.4636,0.0602,4.5927,0.5927,1.3964,3.1547,1.1568,2.2184,0.1182,4.0525,0.6928,5.6088,0.8924,3.5706,1.3474,3.6295,0.8761,1.8265,1.0014,1.1795,4.376,5.1038,1.1256,2.6992,2.9593,2.0985,1.0729,0.0707,5.4125,2.5854,2.8615,2.3365,5.3559,1.1569,0.026,2.4773,3.7568,2.4259,3.5706,4.1385,1.4535,6.2581,3.5732,0.4369,0.4577,0.0002,1.6652,0.9572,1.1979,4.217,1.1449,0.3142,0.051,3.7022,0.1323,0.0002,3.6637,3.5393,0.7139,4.8303,0.6138,4.8756,2.9102,0.0001,0.0009,3.2533,4.0375,0.1592,4.9395,4.5837,1.1248,0.0002,0.0456,3.9995,2.3059,1.2914,2.2501,2.4138,1.9036,1.8856,1.1933,0.9769,1.2141,0.6093,0.0002,0.4478,3.3005,2.6743,5.1262,1.2084,0.265,4.9205,0.0045,3.1357,3.9942,0.6271,0.0001,0.2928,2.8642,3.4032,3.0931,3.0913,3.6379,2.1601,6.2896,1.0757,0.0001,2.9988,0.8574,2.6267,4.4288,4.0619,1.2017,0.8742,0.5136,4.9361,1.0433,3.7393,4.0698,0.9058,3.3051,2.069,2.5125,0.354,1.2383,3.0088,2.0051,1.1572,2.0419,2.6894,1.2013,2.1046,2.4282,0.2251,0.4901,3.8431,2.7169,0.9831,1.6534,2.138,4.3882,3.7778,0.5135,0.5353,0.7018,5.3573,5.5295,1.3121,0.6313,0.0001,5.2018,0.466,4.18,1.5379,3.265,3.5244,3.9331,0.1803,2.8712,2.8273,3.1557,0.1303,0.8147,6.7002,4.2707,6.7249,5.02,3.6803,0.1679,0.7544,2.64,0.0077,0.4734,0.3672,1.7674,1.3309,4.7546,0.0431,5.5689,1.3157,0.9884,4.6853,1.8155,1.4897,0.1241,3.0837,2.3765,0.7799,1.5531,5.3074,2.1699,0.3375,1.668,2.3912,0.0688,1.6213,3.2921,2.1453,2.6204,0.4786,0.4022,2.994,0.5421,0.4173,4.2174,3.5786,0.9593,8.6323,0.3446,2.4376,0.6745,0.2882,0.5208,3.9605,5.2583,3.6962,5.2139,2.8079,5.1721,0.6418,3.2802,4.6646,3.1105,4.0814,4.0764,5.2129,3.9457,0.5109,4.5677,7.2091,0.1218,3.8174,5.082,5.8858,2.0066,0.3399,0.6244,0.7598,0.7479,2.6227,4.5816,1.2051,2.2742,0.0807,3.3511,0.012,1.6951,0.2596,0.0001,3.5495,2.489,1.0169,5.5825,5.4443,3.8662,2.3114,6.1242,1.2507,5.29,4.5738,2.9611,0.8323,6.1814,0.4838,6.1163,1.1992,1.6637,1.591,4.3989,0.0001,6.0686,3.1372,4.6407,0.4397,1.3564,0.3507,3.0892,3.0892,0.0064,4.891,2.9828,0.8377,1.4188,1.6608,3.5143,5.3192,0.9492,2.1999,0.0078,4.6992,2.9166,3.0056,0.6886,2.4795,3.3742,1.5002,5.1436,2.1745,2.6445,1.4738,2.3632,5.1223,0.047,5.2413,0.277,3.8658,2.4927,4.3964,4.1051,2.1461,6.0758,0.5196,4.3288,3.1005,1.1811,4.064,4.0264,0.696,1.1108,1.1816,2.6545,2.9692,0.0572,1.9595,1.8928,4.968,2.7862,0.2938,4.1005,2.142,0.0012,2.0402,1.47,4.7193,0.0171,1.3511,5.9002,1.9402,4.598,4.1941,3.3923,1.5062,0.0205,1.8137,1.47,4.7823,3.1876,2.8434,0.4448,0.1771,3.5836,0.8398,4.3409,5.3974,0.5982,6.0626,1.0542,2.4055,4.1535,0.0404,4.1755,1.2334,2.7528,2.0018,1.2763,5.2768,0.4669,4.911,1.4901,5.6825,0.5071,5.174,1.5257,0.9446,4.8634,0.6845,0.4448,4.3788,2.5374,0.4902,4.4401,2.0838,2.356,1.7184,1.7513,2.5696,0.8506,0.8142,2.1024,0.0465,3.7403,1.2075,1.2829,1.6567,3.8088,0.6397,4.4319,0.0079,3.4036,1.258,3.2659,0.8193,0.3491,6.0594,0.0486,4.0205,1.6056,0.2187,5.9214,1.5375,1.0341,0.0014,1.8726,2.7429,4.2525,0.0068,4.6067,0.5975,3.9392,1.5441,1.3211,2.8457,1.8268,0.3279,0.0002,4.6668,1.3072,1.3936,0.7471,0.0318,2.0349,0.0378,0.1094,2.7558,5.9174,0.6464,0.8004,1.3679,1.0471,1.9294,0.0697,0.7715,0.525,4.6792,0.4833,0.0005,2.8058,1.8186,0.1971,0.3091,0.3567,0.0197,1.6516,0.8167,0.0002,5.37,5.8305,0.9108,6.3964,3.5136,1.2112,1.5119,1.4216,0.0002,3.272,5.4404,0.4146,0.3297,5.1766,1.9292,6.0807,1.9857,0.3227,0.9657,2.3729,1.227,6.0461,5.8016,1.9141,1.3106,2.4358,0.6576,3.0588,2.8323,1.5849,3.442,2.7024,1.0548,0.365]}
{"id":337,"ended":true,"length":512,"gen_text":"The Romanian military is undergoing a three @ - @ stage restructuring. As of 2007, the first short @ - @ term stage was completed ( reorganisation of the command system, implementation of military command systems ), in 2009 the new CSCF (Command and Support Group for Security and Anti-Communist Forces) also was added to the CSCF to assist the Romanian military as part of the military modernization initiative. The CSCF began training during December 2008 before it underwent its 3rd - 5th phase in January 2009.\n\nA significant step forward for the Romanian military is taking place in the new CSCF. The CSCF will use all its available capabilities to support the various missions of the Romanian army and support counter-terrorism activities, with an emphasis on counter-terrorism against organized crime, terrorist networks, criminals and corrupt officials. The CSCF has implemented numerous military-related initiatives with the help of several companies. The new CSCF is also capable of supporting local forces with its own, state-of-the-art weaponry, such as helicopters and armored personnel carriers. This modernization also involves upgrading facilities, the creation of a number of new and emerging units, and the integration of the military resources such as the CSCF into Romanian intelligence and defense (EISC). The new CSCF will also provide the Romanian military with the knowledge and experience to fight against Islamic State, terrorist organizations, and their enemies, including terrorists in international terrorism and human rights violations.\n\nThe new CSCF has a wide range of capabilities. The CSCF is equipped with three distinct operational arms, each with one or more distinct operational systems and weapons. It has also an integrated program of armed, mobile and operational air defence systems, and also a large field capability in the field of nuclear weapons at the tactical range, such as in the S-400-3 (Mortar). Although the CSCF has a well-developed operational system under development for the defense against terrorist attacks, the CSCF will continue to conduct counter-terrorist activities when it is ready, particularly in the field of military communications. Other arms have also been integrated, including the S-200A and M-21A Su-22 air defence systems and the S-25. The CSCF also has a specialized defense systems for operations including attack helicopters, ground patrol helicopters, surveillance aircraft, reconnaissance aircraft and special forces missions.

The music video takes footage from the original version, but adds several new scenes, including some covers that are inspired by The Clash and The King. The video was shot around 2002 when Ross posted his second album, Live & Let Die.\nAn interview in April 2001 about a scene in the remix video features Rick Ross.\nThe video was shot outside of Texas after Ross and Minaj were released.\nRick Ross and Nicki Minaj were photographed at a photo booth during the 2011 Texas album, Live & Let Die. The videos were shot inside of the festival in Austin, Texas. The photo booth contained photographs of Ross looking excited and smiling during the interview with Minaj.\nRoss and Minaj made their last appearances at the New Orleans Lollapalooza in February 2008, appearing live on May 20, 2008. In a video that was shot from a live stream, the pair said they had to move to an apartment in New Orleans due to a broken leg, so some of the crowd members took a picture with them, but not everyone was happy with their move to LA.\nThe clip begins with a shot from a shot taken in Mexico City when Ross held an event for New Orleans musicians where they posed for pictures. When asked if they feel \"a little bit sad\" now that they moved to LA, \"yes, we feel a little sad,\" said Ross. \"With every single song we take, it's got to start with a little bit of sadness. As long as you smile and look at each other like you can, then we're OK.\" It continues with a shot from a post office post and Ross smiling at the camera afterward.\nIn their live recording for \"Live & Let Die,\" Ross mentioned that his last album, The Bitch, was recorded live at The National Center for Contemporary Art in Washington D.C. He later expressed that there was a song by his brother called \"Don't Give a Yoda\" that was released when he was about 25 years old.\nRick Ross and Nicki Minaj are photographed at their own festival after the release of their album, Live & Let Die.

{"id":183,"ended":false,"length":399,"gen_text":"Mortimer Wheeler was born on 10 September 1890 in the city of Glasgow, Scotland. He was the first child of the journalist Robert Mortimer Wheeler and his second wife Emily Wheeler ( n\u00e9e Tammie Hamilton ), in the year 1810.[4] Their home was a popular haunt in the summer months for the children of the city children.[5] A little over a century later he played a major role in the creation and history of the Glasgow Folk Museum [6] after coming to the city to see his father Charles Murray on the 20th November 1910.[7]\n\nIn August 2014 he became the new head curator of the museum, and continued his role as curator of the museum for 18 years; he moved on to manage the museum since 2007. In August last year the museum published a statement expressing its \"deep respect\" to Mortimer Wheeler:\n\nA big thank you to Andrew for his work with us, and my heart can't change when your work is acknowledged and acknowledged by the people.
