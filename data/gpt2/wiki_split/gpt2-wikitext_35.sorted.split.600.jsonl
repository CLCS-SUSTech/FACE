{"id":241,"ended":true,"length":465,"gen_text":"A hereditary risk for AML appears to exist. Multiple cases of AML developing in a family at a rate higher than predicted by chance alone have been reported. Several congenital conditions may increase your risk for AD in your family. The risk of developing autism can differ greatly between individuals because of differential risk factors such as gender, race and sex.\n\nAn association between the time it takes for your child's body to recover from AD and your childhood exposure to benzodiazepines and tranquilizers.\n\nThe risk of pre-symptomatic childhood AD is approximately 1% greater than the risk of PMT (PMT 1.5 ), AML (AML 2.0 ) and PCS (PMT 1.5 ).\n\nBenzodiazepines such as amitriptyline or psilocybin are also found in more than 80% of the CNS and brain-derived neurotrophic factor-catecholamine dehydrogenase (ADHD). Exposure to benzodiazepines and PCS increases the risk of PMT, AML and PMT-induced psychosis.\n\nBenzodiazepines may contribute to amnesia.\n\nBenzodiazepines can increase the risk of PTSD, PTSD-related psychosis, AD and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nBenzodiazepine tranquilizers like citalopram can increase the risk of AD.\n\nExposure to benzodiazepines can increase the risk of suicide.\n\nBenzodiazepines could induce a change in brain chemistry.\n\nBenzodiazepines also affect your brain.\n\nThese findings were reported in a published online peer-reviewed journal.\n\nThis study assessed brain chemistry, neurology, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, personality and mood disorders in women and persons with bipolar disorder.\n\nThere was no statistically significant difference between the study participants when they were evaluated with the same drug. No significant difference in symptoms was seen between the two treatments.\n\nResults included 764 controls with bipolar disorder. There was no difference in symptoms when compared with control subjects.\n\nThe researchers examined blood biomarkers in the participants over four years.\n\nAll patients at risk for developing bipolar disorder developed symptoms between the third and fourth year of treatment (median of 7 days, 15 weeks, 18 months) in comparison with controls.\n\nAfter 4 years of treatment, 473 people with bipolar disorder developed symptoms on the basis of the four-year difference in biomarkers between the three groups of patients.\n\nThe authors compared symptoms, behavior and mood in the three groups

Although the book is written in Japanese English with little translation (as its English translation would make the Japanese, it would probably spoil what the Japanese characters are, there is no official word about the ending, but it will give some insight into the world of Dragon's Tooth). Also, while in this book there is a character who is not as nice as the real Dragon who is also called \"Dragon-Brawn\" or \"Dragon-Pig\", they might even be called \"Dragon-Queen\" (a term based on the way Dragon-Pigs are sometimes called 'Dragon-Queenes').

{"id":4327,"ended":true,"length":573,"gen_text":"The business that became Gulf Oil started in 1901 with the discovery of oil at Spindletop near Beaumont, Texas. A group of investors came together to promote the development of a modern refinery and petroleum processing plant that would allow the new product to be put to work at a reduced-cost point with improved reliability and less maintenance problems.\n\n\"We were able to have a product that could be put into production quickly,\" he says. \"We realized that without that, it would be a problem to meet our demand in the first place and could have problems leading to poor profitability and loss of business. We made that investment, and have been trying to replicate it ever since.\"\n\nBy the time production stopped, Gulf Oil had already turned its attention to the long-term prospects of petroleum processing in an environmentally friendly way: by expanding its production capacity, making available more land to the community and improving facilities like the Ecosystem Assessment Center (EMAC), which keeps track of what is and is not being used. As part of its research, the company also has taken a keen interest in other industries that are growing rapidly.\n\n\"There is a growing body of scientific literature which is questioning the assumptions and limitations on biofuels,\" he says.\n\nAnd from that perspective, Johnson says, Gulf Oil has the potential to serve the wider public, who, he believes, can benefit from the company's low-cost refining system. At the same time, the company has invested heavily in helping people in California get their clean energy projects started faster.\n\nWhen it comes to fuel economy, Gulf Oil's current performance is an improvement over what many people can expect from fuel vehicles, says the company veteran biofuel analyst and current chief technology officer Mike Chiang.\n\n\"This kind of stuff has a lot of potential at the beginning stages, when the fuel prices are low or when I am paying a lot of money, where we don't have a lot of fuel at that point for sure,\" Johnson says over a cup of hot wine at a local restaurant. \"I like when you are going above and beyond what you know will work. I think it's a game changer here.\"\n\nIf Gulf Oil has something the public can expect in the coming years, that's how. The company has even set up a new company to promote its oil industry. Though the team has only started working on its fuel oil units and can't offer a pricing list now for oil to buy, Chiang is hopeful that the company will be competitive with other energy companies going forward who, he says, will also look to see what this company does differently.\n\n\"I mean, if it's going to be good, and if it can produce what we expect it will need to get more fuel to move it forward. It's good that they are going to have the knowledge that they need to make it better, which in turn is good for everyone,\" Johnson says.","token_len":601,"entropy":[7.7525,4.6366,6.0801,9.6965,2.1785,4.6203,1.5442,7.519,2.5108,1.3932,3.7719,0.1437,1.917,3.7684,8.4995,4.3263,1.002,1.5648,6.0437,7.3495,0.8418,0.0154,0.4859,2.4108,0.3846,4.0198,4.5494,0.1027,3.631,4.1907,1.4598,0.7052,7.6747,1.038,3.0505,0.2535,2.3917,5.8949,2.6507,1.9479,5.1224,3.3637,0.6251,3.1388,0.5713,3.429,1.8457,5.0677,4.2262,0.1094,0.7373,5.8665,0.5864,2.4534,3.285,1.7642,5.6287,5.5993,1.2217,5.2443,5.049,4.8191,4.2032,0.8838,3.714,2.7477,5.6884,0.2094,1.3149,0.0012,3.7389,1.9195,2.0172,2.4319,0.012,4.5323,1.0858,4.4299,0.4948,2.3192,0.9231,2.7398,2.3943,1.0465,4.0139,1.8449,3.6244,1.1876,0.1257,0.5729,1.5374,4.8695,0.9078,5.96,2.952,1.2023,2.2018,0.8617,1.134,1.701,3.5452,2.9578,5.2571,2.2871,2.884,3.8159,1.105,3.5032,0.0739,2.9483,4.6826,3.4009,4.2881,6.0491,0.5274,5.3474,4.2764,2.8496,4.2274,0.2176,2.3844,1.4295,1.2874,4.2787,2.8366,2.7604,2.3627,1.0987,5.1042,1.6666,5.3289,0.3681,5.1595,0.7396,0.6589,0.0003,0.1899,0.0942,0.0002,4.2267,1.1636,1.8612,6.3367,3.9724,1.6173,1.7734,0.1838,0.7879,2.1908,5.0446,1.8058,0.4394,0.2013,2.0507,5.4665,0.1666,0.2429,4.0086,0.3985,5.154,3.8463,1.9839,4.9248,2.5393,0.4838,0.8671,4.7222,2.8216,4.4438,1.3933,2.6079,1.1444,2.4634,3.5896,4.2625,1.7727,3.1241,1.7339,2.6837,4.0103,1.2218,3.7834,4.83,4.4205,1.9036,6.0106,5.1777,4.7939,1.2873,2.7993,3.0688,0.8553,1.0511,1.2728,5.9275,0.5186,0.0064,4.1946,1.7748,3.8342,1.1633,0.0056,2.1893,1.8203,1.2093,4.5778,3.8411,0.001,1.7747,5.1238,0.7787,1.8037,1.5736,2.3604,4.1429,3.9647,1.5495,4.6624,0.0391,0.0143,4.2802,3.5422,1.7012,2.1315,3.5918,2.2381,1.6766,0.7606,0.0002,1.3505,3.2042,1.5774,0.8329,3.2523,4.102,0.0133,3.0953,2.0675,4.0044,3.0882,5.4364,0.7827,4.9031,2.2308,4.3591,4.2569,5.5514,0.275,0.0001,1.1178,3.0875,0.1145,0.1108,2.1932,0.0002,4.606,5.7638,2.6552,1.1601,0.1527,6.3042,1.4668,0.7594,1.6822,0.0575,1.5502,3.717,0.8962,0.0806,5.4126,2.9522,5.5981,3.099,2.4736,3.5209,3.8711,1.5821,1.8633,0.0066,3.7065,1.3815,0.3272,1.3854,2.2072,0.1007,5.4704,1.7111,0.8475,5.5526,4.6232,0.7394,5.9184,0.9007,0.4107,0.0011,0.0294,2.1388,0.7543,1.5414,4.7586,0.962,0.1247,5.6337,3.5916,2.4234,6.2471,3.2637,1.7586,3.9469,1.7421,4.9539,1.8715,5.9679,1.2359,0.5691,0.0002,5.5926,2.222,0.2555,0.025,4.8707,1.5922,0.2593,2.0621,0.097,2.2564,4.2728,5.5692,1.124,4.908,2.712,0.7932,2.927,3.4692,3.4454,5.2687,0.7648,0.8298,4.8911,4.9708,1.4127,1.3742,5.4395,1.1467,8.5857,5.9506,0.8487,1.8638,2.21,4.2027,4.0521,2.412,0.0305,4.4288,6.1417,4.7137,0.1949,0.933,0.0002,0.5446,3.9665,5.2705,0.0006,5.3389,2.5392,2.3939,1.3335,0.3741,1.3133,5.6063,1.5952,4.6171,3.4429,1.8609,3.6074,2.5533,3.264,5.4231,0.9617,2.12,3.836,1.71,6.3957,3.666,5.6761,2.2261,1.0398,0.5819,0.8525,3.2984,4.3759,2.9839,3.3554,0.0007,0.571,2.0371,0.6505,0.0249,3.5295,4.3229,3.0031,0.5331,4.4895,4.019,0.4382,2.3382,0.0797,8.8374,2.1754,3.7413,0.0302,3.2959,6.5051,2.0073,1.1314,2.7602,1.8683,0.2496,0.5323,2.7027,4.3437,4.8965,2.2414,2.6045,3.8747,5.3884,1.5259,0.0147,1.1839,1.031,4.7482,4.7686,2.0822,1.9904,1.9304,1.4661,1.811,1.2226,1.6633,5.503,0.1763,0.0006,4.3112,0.8699,0.2329,0.0002,4.8686,1.4457,0.026,3.3615,5.3845,5.8347,0.6726,1.0524,3.4629,2.7104,0.9114,1.846,0.4042,0.1486,3.6496,1.477,4.6665,3.3265,2.8206,0.6427,1.7691,5.2068,3.67,0.3021,0.4618,3.3978,4.077,2.0075,4.7881,0.9146,3.5541,4.5551,2.1924,6.511,1.6474,5.7079,2.136,3.7173,3.013,1.9724,0.3887,2.5077,4.8167,5.8014,5.3713,3.65,4.9537,0.4047,4.3195,1.6301,5.2358,3.9614,6.5493,3.887,4.6624,3.504,3.533,0.5567,2.3965,0.0044,2.841,2.6088,0.6714,1.4051,1.1842,0.656,2.1941,5.5937,2.016,1.477,3.7555,0.9372,6.4515,0.0858,5.0592,5.0262,0.7222,0.3147,0.0048,2.154,3.4703,3.0985,0.7375,5.2165,1.9798,5.5878,3.4933,3.2199,3.468,0.7423,0.2783,0.0002,0.5346,1.7622,5.6978,0.2724,2.66,2.6886,1.4572,1.9611,0.0457,0.6185,4.4058,1.0895,3.8429,1.9151,0.3958,3.0148,4.4148,4.2652,1.0798,3.2298,2.4148,1.451,4.8369,0.8286,3.0647,3.6358,3.464,2.3996,5.6052,2.0061,1.6188,2.9959,2.1887,0.8327,4.9818,1.984,2.6511,0.9803,3.1243,0.2593,2.182,2.1063,5.0503,2.3044,1.6824,2.9423,0.1977,2.1439,2.1489,2.3151,1.9223,3.6421,3.7759,0.699,2.0654,0.7421,0.741,4.7063,0.9793,2.0665,0.0372,0.0716]}

{"id":2932,"ended":true,"length":454,"gen_text":"Genes with a most recent common ancestor, and thus a shared evolutionary ancestry, are known as homologs. These genes appear either from gene duplication within an organism's genome, where they are 'duplicated' genes or from those produced by many copies of the opposite sex' in other animals. Many have been reported to date to the beginning of the human lineage. This line of questioning is most certainly based on the existence of genes within genes that are shared between all mammals and birds. The hypothesis that all three species are homologs is also widely accepted, although not confirmed by any scientific method. But these hypothesis are sometimes called heterozygous or heterozygous with one exception: the homophilosome or homologous variant found in most extant species is known as heterozygous with any one or more of the same genes found in more than one species. Although it is probably true that some species use less than three alleles of certain genes together, it is known that most species will use alleles that differ from one another in some way.\n\nThe homozygous form of the allelic coding proteins is found in the human genome. These include D. ochricoides, which are found in the human pomodemus, C. albinus (Pomodemus), E. dicini, which is found in the plasmodium, and F. spp. These proteins were identified in two European pomodemus samples from 1966. The researchers found that the two homologs could be combined as they share the identical homolog of D. ochricoides at least 5-fold in their homolog number, with D. ochricoides having a homozygous value of 2.4-fold compared with C. albinus, C. albinus being 1-fold higher than E. dicini. The authors also reported a homozygous level of A. bivalvegatus, A. bivalvegatus and O. peri when E. peri's value was found for G. lindii. The homozygous version of the A. bivalvegatus protein is called the homozygous form of D. ochricoides in the PTL DNA gene.\n\nA number of recent studies have shown that several loci have also been associated with the occurrence of a hybrid homozygous gene using different approaches to different genetic material. For example, some DNA mutations in A. bivalvegatus are related to some alleles in A. albinus that can potentially generate a hybrid plasmid. The similarity of allele frequencies and the presence of a genetic variation in A. bivalvegatus to a known mutation for human blood could thus contribute to the identification of a large genetic heterogeneity in both PTL and human DNA in populations with homozygous autosomal recessive mutations.","token_len":601,"entropy":[6.3923,6.1247,2.9189,8.92,4.0586,8.1733,2.1664,2.3316,3.3895,4.202,2.959,6.7651,4.8211,4.9207,1.7799,2.2375,3.8209,1.7272,3.473,3.0495,1.0376,0.7989,2.8573,4.664,4.8947,6.5662,4.9199,5.1487,1.565,4.1239,3.3084,2.9435,3.5202,1.1928,1.2458,4.9105,1.7094,1.1423,7.0409,4.7911,0.1477,0.5112,0.2647,5.5886,2.3401,0.7569,6.0012,5.1467,0.6195,5.5201,3.8567,0.2063,1.3613,7.8734,0.5837,8.5517,2.6746,3.8839,4.1677,0.7567,5.5384,4.4935,0.6486,3.4472,1.4586,4.804,2.2735,1.5884,3.6443,0.0206,0.8191,1.4639,1.143,1.3586,3.545,4.9765,0.5494,6.7828,1.5261,4.5384,3.6646,3.1261,0.1099,1.2165,4.3751,0.0495,3.948,4.1701,4.3235,1.5326,1.4017,2.5483,1.126,3.9231,3.1681,1.5334,1.0216,0.8928,2.5926,5.0559,0.7375,3.4351,6.0197,2.8972,1.7901,1.1066,0.0547,0.5623,1.0763,3.4741,5.0106,0.7237,1.8714,2.22,3.1199,3.6899,1.4416,2.1705,2.9918,1.6815,0.2414,5.2755,4.2594,6.3753,1.2741,5.4718,2.8481,5.2819,1.7201,0.3093,2.317,1.4083,0.6556,0.0841,5.6821,4.8871,2.4054,1.5884,2.4274,2.9611,7.1584,2.549,0.7783,1.181,4.5299,1.3645,1.6502,1.4977,5.3972,4.3087,0.2475,3.6383,5.1096,2.6527,2.2022,2.4919,0.305,3.6778,0.232,0.0725,2.1989,5.6265,2.6671,3.4192,0.3602,1.2944,0.3692,4.2758,2.7501,4.3812,0.2369,5.0939,0.6911,0.3923,1.0604,0.3126,4.8487,2.7195,0.478,5.6989,1.1496,0.1093,2.4855,2.167,5.9554,4.5275,0.6535,3.9097,2.9377,0.004,0.7153,4.3391,0.7406,6.0575,0.4707,1.9351,0.2414,4.4588,0.1481,3.2759,1.3186,4.4626,1.1657,6.042,0.004,2.3213,3.2655,1.5333,0.9596,0.332,1.7019,1.9124,0.4467,0.6566,2.9302,0.0045,2.0212,2.5679,1.9002,0.1845,4.6085,0.3155,1.101,4.7152,2.498,5.5935,5.6784,2.5562,2.8841,0.3642,2.1,3.1024,1.0935,1.0138,2.8046,3.9401,5.7963,4.4834,5.4781,2.6928,3.8361,3.337,0.39,0.956,2.7411,0.8612,1.9961,0.2746,1.5896,1.3655,5.6534,5.233,2.8687,5.9278,1.3619,1.3187,3.9036,0.0516,4.568,3.0931,1.3479,3.321,4.0954,1.9248,0.4193,0.2868,0.0241,2.4777,3.6946,0.0506,4.3937,3.9034,5.4827,2.0161,4.2221,1.106,0.1856,0.0671,0.6543,5.8239,2.934,0.5539,0.0245,1.0544,1.2713,2.3488,0.04,4.117,0.7548,0.3478,5.5993,1.2293,3.4726,4.192,1.089,5.0861,5.3085,5.7309,0.0521,0.0574,0.0671,0.4265,2.8987,1.5867,6.0203,2.5077,1.4554,5.0614,1.9827,0.6721,1.5556,4.0697,2.5517,0.7179,0.2354,5.0492,0.9036,4.4867,4.1814,4.7654,3.2665,1.5954,5.8209,3.4184,0.9681,1.9154,1.4248,0.1144,0.0845,0.0057,0.0009,0.0045,0.0243,4.5608,2.6616,4.3609,2.9804,0.6047,2.4383,3.3051,1.338,0.3749,5.5428,1.706,2.922,1.9537,0.07,0.2816,0.0041,0.0017,0.0037,0.0164,1.8836,1.3507,0.6756,0.6222,0.0824,4.8141,0.301,2.8963,0.6642,3.0061,2.0169,0.0317,3.3906,0.7563,2.1565,0.0077,0.042,0.0053,0.0031,2.286,2.8313,0.0033,0.7049,0.0288,0.0047,3.0257,3.3072,1.9504,0.0793,2.9559,1.9074,0.9573,0.0501,0.1804,0.0015,0.0036,1.3213,1.655,3.3879,2.6248,3.5264,2.7258,1.5392,0.0494,0.0384,5.4446,0.1602,4.3557,0.4163,4.0182,4.7542,0.5791,4.6716,3.6509,1.7083,2.8923,0.039,2.8172,0.2071,0.6881,0.1841,0.0963,2.9243,5.6162,0.0242,5.7205,3.7323,6.015,5.178,0.0476,2.4684,0.0079,5.6506,4.5201,0.4223,3.5748,4.6368,5.4904,0.1223,4.6627,3.6416,3.0821,0.9335,1.9545,1.4283,0.0357,0.0907,4.8766,0.1571,1.3232,2.3076,0.0546,0.2734,0.0009,0.0111,0.0023,0.0033,3.1645,1.3574,4.3959,2.0686,1.0852,0.7543,0.0492,3.7955,0.5353,2.7632,0.0667,0.1517,0.0114,0.0011,0.0065,0.014,3.4985,1.3258,3.6776,6.6619,5.9424,5.0322,2.1439,1.1367,0.0003,3.2362,3.0152,0.0024,3.9593,1.2845,0.335,2.0375,0.2746,5.5073,6.0814,0.0031,3.1266,5.2643,0.2052,3.0257,0.0193,2.0335,3.8047,0.0735,3.2669,5.5272,4.2931,0.4981,0.1159,2.9121,6.9381,3.9515,4.3876,3.9471,5.2093,3.2606,4.7199,0.7398,1.9808,0.1838,0.0522,3.7777,4.9468,4.8997,2.0341,4.8715,0.0446,0.3794,0.0006,0.0062,0.0024,0.0026,2.5778,4.5522,0.042,5.1448,4.9484,0.0668,1.7455,1.955,0.0547,4.1532,0.0047,0.0052,2.4715,4.0511,6.146,5.8592,1.0211,0.8566,5.8012,0.13,0.027,1.0076,2.4171,5.796,0.5285,6.1283,0.491,2.9761,1.7725,3.2885,0.1303,1.8767,4.9745,3.0968,1.0989,1.0392,0.004,0.2494,0.0005,0.0027,0.002,0.001,3.3307,2.7455,4.4169,4.0377,5.1574,5.3832,5.607,3.8024,3.7774,4.0356,0.0687,0.5636,2.9506,0.0436,1.1745,6.0968,4.2201,5.4066,1.0373,4.8701,4.7886,0.0688,0.3693,1.3044,2.0855,4.0775,5.5542,1.8885,2.3342,0.2158,0.0368,4.9246,0.1783,0.2867,0.024,1.2189,0.2799]}
{"id":3269,"ended":true,"length":551,"gen_text":"Goater joined Manchester City at a turbulent point in their history, with newly appointed manager Joe Royle battling to save the club from relegation to Second Division. Goater scored three goals in the final six games of that season for City to secure their first league title since 1994, his final in charge with them. With a top league campaign still to follow, Goater's goalkeeping credentials are as interesting as ever. In the opening two months of this season, Goater produced his first and only league goal.\n\nHe also produced his first Premier League goal of the season on 5-1 victory over Everton in April. The former West Ham man has continued his career in that role with nine league goals and nine assists in seven matches for Manchester City since joining the club with a 4-1 win over Everton on 14 March 2014. His goal was a direct result of being paired with the same goal he netted against Stoke when he scored an easy save for the Baggies in the 3-0 FA Cup win against Hull on 8 December 2014. Just a month later, he netted a second goal for Liverpool during the second half of a 2-0 win over Chelsea in the FA Cup quarter-finals on 18 January 2015, a goal which was enough to earn him a new Premier League deal.\n\nGoater also started the season with one of the Premier League's best sides playing two different games at the start of the season. In his final 12 Premier League games, the 6\u2032 9\u2033 defender produced 18 goals and 26 assists which were a combined 33 in 51 appearances, his most appearances as a full-back in that time. The 21\u2032 1\/2-foot, 180+lb winger continues to make an impact as he has 15 goals in the league this term, but only two in 26 appearances this season. Goater is expected to take the spot of Chris Smalling which was his final season at Loftus Road this term where he produced just three goals for City to lead them down to the Championship exit.\n\nIn the current round of FA Cups this season, Goater has been one of Chelsea's most consistent performers for the side. Alongside the usual suspects at their right flank he will look to add more attacking threat on the counter. Goater has a great understanding of how to use his experience on the forecheck, and also knows how to put his foot up and execute one of the most demanding passes in English football. When playing a central position with Chelsea, it is important to protect the ball down the right flank of Chelsea's midfield. Goater's ability, balance and athleticism help the team to create opportunities for themselves to play counter-attacking passes.\n\nChelsea's biggest attackmen are back and centre of the park to take the pressure off the opposition's forwards. Goater's versatility is a great asset in his attacking game which will help Chelsea to improve in the face of injury, which will ultimately be a key factor in the side's season.","token_len":601,"entropy":[9.9496,9.2761,7.964,2.1743,3.329,3.9159,8.8068,3.4725,0.5306,1.412,3.1652,1.4986,2.7652,8.0372,1.7229,0.6909,4.3616,6.3227,6.7219,6.5973,1.3541,4.6517,1.2395,0.5187,1.3827,0.4142,3.6669,10.7056,0.0422,1.1119,10.188,0.0722,4.9964,3.3251,0.3135,0.5002,1.9553,3.3353,3.2174,0.547,0.581,3.131,0.8406,3.6068,1.9597,4.1391,3.6589,2.7308,1.9928,2.5246,1.0488,0.923,3.9151,1.7955,4.4267,3.1148,2.7303,1.9112,4.9631,3.5873,0.759,4.8361,2.5297,5.3664,4.5421,3.7628,3.5953,1.059,4.6544,0.3592,1.0659,0.0106,2.3145,4.4991,3.1371,3.0486,1.7425,4.3492,5.9627,0.2352,0.5079,0.7149,3.6691,1.9714,4.5397,2.7959,2.9054,0.0569,2.2564,0.5812,0.1775,1.3403,0.0103,4.394,4.296,1.7919,5.5206,0.0877,2.4427,0.6144,2.8415,1.7759,0.0012,4.0855,2.4594,3.3101,1.2802,0.7932,3.2418,0.0045,0.6313,2.4455,0.1095,0.2367,2.9661,4.894,4.0339,1.6375,3.6577,0.4927,3.1605,1.4529,3.4248,0.8944,2.3621,3.5006,4.9973,0.3721,2.5981,2.5228,4.9458,1.2388,4.0479,1.8139,3.6238,1.1787,1.7817,4.1579,1.6936,0.3108,1.7248,2.9469,1.0836,1.2094,4.794,2.4001,1.6226,1.9428,0.4283,3.5896,1.5569,0.8693,0.2178,5.866,0.9974,5.3339,0.0257,0.997,0.6939,0.6024,2.3011,1.2274,4.4713,2.3992,2.7766,0.0844,3.7757,2.7591,2.1143,2.5329,3.9248,0.7501,0.0131,4.7442,5.4608,0.3219,3.1798,5.7695,4.4337,4.0326,3.4508,0.9657,3.6287,5.3229,0.8144,2.5648,4.873,5.4817,4.999,2.7035,1.8148,3.2903,0.0022,1.3398,0.7815,2.5081,0.0146,1.4854,3.9076,0.0026,0.9534,3.1237,3.6063,1.4512,3.4917,3.1224,1.039,0.1169,6.4352,3.0689,1.8808,0.4405,0.1931,1.6238,2.4431,2.0317,2.4237,1.8852,1.6595,3.9853,4.6525,1.0287,4.1781,0.5311,0.2707,2.2787,1.337,0.0012,1.0721,0.7915,0.4727,3.2025,1.3152,0.5886,1.1647,0.0027,2.8836,0.194,2.1942,0.6095,3.3948,1.8202,0.7644,2.8577,2.9718,1.0351,1.4069,2.2121,5.4375,0.139,2.0335,0.5824,0.8955,2.869,2.7755,0.0011,3.086,0.6952,0.4598,0.0001,1.0204,0.0504,2.5235,4.4191,2.2912,1.2969,1.5299,5.2872,1.2334,0.6167,2.6705,0.0027,0.1196,1.3468,3.5883,5.8803,5.8249,3.4006,3.8798,2.1966,1.2409,4.937,0.0354,0.1272,0.3527,0.9218,2.29,2.1349,3.2703,5.0557,2.2754,0.0015,0.8395,1.0061,2.7668,5.2924,3.4244,3.8554,0.0845,3.3014,3.6144,5.3173,0.879,1.114,4.6118,0.0076,5.1079,3.4751,3.3663,2.5959,5.157,4.555,5.4774,0.61,3.6107,2.5989,1.7274,1.4579,4.8671,0.2899,2.7804,0.2407,0.0909,2.1988,2.7109,1.4039,0.499,2.8125,4.7145,0.6089,4.4316,6.7366,0.4363,6.3551,2.7081,2.7515,2.4195,4.4299,4.012,2.9203,5.7352,0.4889,3.3752,1.6525,0.2583,2.4617,2.1218,1.4116,5.3343,0.8506,1.8182,3.0523,2.4025,0.7946,2.748,0.9307,3.7473,3.1538,2.6656,2.5379,5.2051,0.817,3.4611,0.7012,0.4509,2.8986,0.0513,1.9302,3.9891,0.0112,4.6895,2.3133,5.3043,0.7713,4.5501,0.176,0.0001,5.5725,2.2499,2.1477,3.4342,1.4203,1.5885,4.9914,0.0,0.0002,3.3515,1.592,5.5886,0.1855,2.7888,3.0909,2.5516,0.5286,2.8763,1.9649,4.3271,4.0245,2.1925,5.0752,0.89,1.0334,1.9645,6.219,0.6493,0.4693,0.0002,3.0858,1.5163,5.2847,5.8212,0.1065,5.7748,4.1896,4.0835,0.2712,0.1303,0.9511,0.0239,0.6639,2.5294,2.7932,0.0214,6.1399,0.0467,1.4912,0.9945,0.5813,3.8704,0.9975,3.7179,1.173,5.6283,0.3352,2.1023,4.7286,1.9793,4.3519,5.4046,4.0739,2.511,4.9386,4.1496,4.5063,0.0628,2.4175,2.7301,2.1906,2.7758,3.4816,0.2782,3.1203,2.8326,3.4075,0.0233,1.3046,3.5851,3.6097,3.5193,0.0353,2.1981,0.4933,2.4726,0.6772,4.5311,3.2574,0.1323,6.7792,1.6645,1.7744,1.9034,3.867,2.7172,0.3725,0.014,4.8747,1.7041,3.0889,3.5768,1.6955,5.398,5.8983,0.9806,0.3916,1.1878,4.4732,1.6184,0.5055,3.9174,0.0326,0.1793,4.8046,3.0064,4.2882,3.0368,2.4655,3.3932,2.5789,0.7308,2.3819,0.6058,1.4185,0.4723,5.5805,0.8643,1.8092,5.5153,0.7088,1.3839,2.052,4.1389,3.8734,0.5379,2.4272,1.1974,1.6271,0.0334,2.1285,1.8853,6.8204,4.5497,0.3271,4.956,6.0084,2.7021,1.7185,1.011,2.4607,2.7827,1.1547,2.0487,4.113,3.1722,5.5452,0.5929,0.203,0.0081,4.98,1.1891,0.9382,0.0002,4.0934,1.5063,4.445,5.3767,4.4647,1.7216,5.6162,2.8665,3.4499,4.6797,1.017,0.5427,4.2345,3.3951,1.5288,2.6411,0.2096,1.3806,3.2875,1.8672,4.0416,0.563,2.3795,0.0431,1.8795,2.9646,2.2097,2.2429,3.7126,0.6113,2.5292,3.294,4.6223,1.1384,2.9157,2.4105,1.7128,2.8974,1.1613,4.6958,2.6275,0.742,4.1372,0.0248,4.593,2.5924,3.9116,1.9755,4.8149,2.1084,1.3637,1.8624,0.5709,0.5047,1.5787,3.4417,0.1496,4.1093,0.6944]}
{"id":2455,"ended":true,"length":570,"gen_text":"Most churches in the prosperity movement are non @ - @ denominational and independent, though some groups have formed networks. Prosperity churches typically reject Presbyterian polity ( or governance ) and the idea of 'God' in its current way to those churches that accept the denomination\n\nThe fact is that there is nothing for Protestant Christians to worship in the way of the Bible in their time.\n\nThis could change once evangelical Christianity has been forced out of the mainstream of church culture after the Second World War - or will go away, and most churches will have to settle for non-conforming ideas.\n\nIf your congregation or denomination has a problem accepting new ideas, or your church doesn't accept new ideas, consider joining them. Some denominations even have \"do not ask\" messages. This will likely include any or all members of congregations who oppose the church's current idea of government ( and other traditional forms of religion )\n\nThis can also give new meaning to some Christian churches and new Christian denominations.\n\nI have never found churches using \"God's word\" to justify their ideas.\n\nI have read numerous other Christian writings, both through my own ministry as a religious leader and for many of my friends. These authors are honest, sincere, and sincere when it comes to theology.\n\nTheir reasoning for leaving one denomination is different than others, which is why I will never support their idea:\n\n...The \"unitarianism\" doctrine was established by God at the Second Vatican Council, and today the same is true of any other denomination. If that doctrine is accepted, it is an open mystery. What is it like for a non-conforming man or woman? Do we want to be considered, and accepted? The Bible says that God created mankind so their hearts and minds are free from sin at the beginning; they do not have the right to sin in the flesh. So if we do not want to go through life in such a way, then those with different churches disagree about God's word. The only thing that makes sense for those who wish to be considered free is that their differences do not necessarily have to be considered. If a member of a Catholic denomination does not want to follow the teachings of their Catholic superiors, they will have to make do with what they have heard about God's Word, and not what He said. The churches that do not accept Christianity generally do so by way of religion, not by being religious, but merely by using their religious worldview to justify their worldview.\n\nI'm not trying to suggest that Christian religion, like Catholicism, is some sort of \"good\" or \"evil religion\", I want you to take a look at what that actually is, and whether it can be improved (if at all). The only thing that it does bring me is a great deal of respect (especially if that's based on your own personal religious beliefs).\n\nBut I do not think Christianity is \"unitarianism\".","token_len":601,"entropy":[11.1093,2.4007,1.3288,13.8677,5.8764,2.006,7.2133,15.7422,10.1758,5.3315,9.3747,0.0161,3.978,7.2309,2.5974,5.8775,2.3933,5.9012,2.2758,6.3338,6.089,2.2025,11.1131,0.0821,4.7792,6.3385,6.3673,8.1883,11.8647,1.2859,3.8211,8.968,10.1048,1.4696,1.3629,4.0842,3.8915,0.3972,4.8671,4.7174,2.298,1.7844,4.6094,4.7808,6.764,5.6152,5.7819,3.3188,1.8629,5.6947,2.1486,4.1431,6.6638,0.0448,3.2656,5.6838,1.9543,0.8087,2.8755,1.1507,4.1307,5.4545,5.4917,3.1924,0.4,4.3451,1.1862,1.5153,5.211,0.6721,1.7985,2.8636,3.3633,3.2415,6.3936,0.8697,2.2939,0.0004,3.7745,5.8696,3.9176,4.2257,4.9974,2.842,2.5708,2.3997,4.8984,1.4571,0.1812,0.6634,2.7452,2.571,4.9962,4.3452,6.0037,1.2824,3.3381,0.6683,0.0009,5.3648,2.7812,4.4223,5.4197,2.4838,3.3667,2.8042,4.9675,1.8052,0.9942,3.3662,1.0632,4.9007,0.1361,3.9715,0.2473,4.6889,1.2847,4.6356,1.3034,0.4765,0.0003,3.4212,5.1813,3.8952,4.5752,2.4548,2.4986,1.9729,3.8161,4.562,4.9174,0.9893,0.8392,3.0492,4.7843,2.3031,2.8708,0.0005,3.4205,1.368,0.1156,0.6781,4.3102,3.081,3.1778,0.9795,4.7847,2.0303,3.7767,1.6417,4.0552,5.7757,2.2058,2.9248,0.618,6.7155,2.0792,3.4162,2.8394,4.6194,5.0118,5.0455,5.2736,0.0475,5.4777,0.9768,5.082,0.0953,1.847,5.5179,1.6541,3.3742,1.2829,3.5298,4.6392,0.3706,5.3505,3.4022,4.6699,4.5153,4.8284,2.8822,0.144,3.7543,1.1362,1.4803,0.0003,4.1429,3.2324,2.0495,5.08,4.4216,1.5676,0.0585,3.7785,3.5333,3.7233,3.4145,4.6899,5.5948,1.2796,1.3444,1.4054,0.0002,4.2294,2.7154,4.1201,3.4875,4.335,5.9788,3.2336,3.3223,2.1332,1.2375,0.1457,1.6943,3.1156,1.2765,4.5015,1.1143,1.4855,0.0003,2.4113,1.4561,3.2251,4.7016,4.2296,3.1963,4.6309,2.1267,4.7119,5.7002,2.725,0.5706,4.7293,2.8199,0.4618,5.5907,2.4828,0.5991,5.3809,4.6218,2.3573,0.3385,2.2541,1.7531,4.4988,4.8305,2.5275,5.6265,1.1161,3.19,0.8598,0.7215,3.8058,5.3284,0.5169,0.0079,0.0064,4.571,1.1675,0.9809,0.0003,5.2707,5.7018,2.1566,4.7837,6.5746,2.6188,1.6752,4.7745,1.2735,3.6646,2.0645,3.8543,1.0528,0.6108,1.0684,3.8905,2.7389,3.2179,2.5652,3.2116,5.8087,1.3991,0.0003,5.9757,4.6098,4.8966,6.0198,3.1458,1.9786,0.2282,3.981,3.6137,5.1056,0.7882,5.4536,4.3374,0.6648,4.3007,1.9067,0.0325,1.7408,1.2953,5.3758,2.3489,5.1271,3.4103,0.553,0.6404,3.0332,1.2174,0.7557,0.7677,4.4375,4.5163,2.0979,1.2292,3.1681,1.2488,1.7353,1.7326,4.0488,4.0499,6.6143,2.011,4.909,1.2237,3.8822,5.1495,2.2652,1.2263,2.9619,0.0893,2.2964,0.1813,5.888,1.7592,0.1381,2.9032,3.9924,2.9446,2.9456,0.5689,1.5492,4.1299,4.9505,3.0398,1.7879,2.3819,3.443,2.8634,1.682,1.4194,2.3961,2.4816,3.4721,4.1815,6.833,4.5173,1.7327,0.3476,1.6066,2.9787,1.2212,1.5133,7.1876,1.3114,2.0845,3.39,3.035,3.1069,0.0725,1.7453,2.7046,1.6933,0.0577,2.3554,2.7312,1.0658,4.4065,0.7946,3.9011,2.8286,1.5531,3.0142,0.3445,1.5626,0.3082,4.9316,1.571,1.8501,1.5431,3.9645,0.2296,0.4267,0.9087,1.7037,5.6545,3.9798,4.803,5.8152,5.9021,2.6284,3.6699,0.136,1.793,0.7338,2.818,3.84,2.1755,1.0645,3.3383,2.2077,1.2489,3.6494,0.7864,3.8774,0.0355,2.4189,2.721,5.7679,1.841,1.1068,3.5935,6.0644,3.086,0.024,4.3679,2.4911,0.2093,0.8524,5.0872,1.3924,3.0658,2.4744,4.0879,0.2838,0.6595,5.5041,1.6785,2.7238,0.2025,1.3211,0.1969,3.283,0.6658,1.8591,0.0545,2.1867,4.07,4.264,0.3208,1.8849,2.7062,2.0746,0.3238,3.8887,3.584,0.2,1.9632,0.979,1.6581,3.7445,3.621,1.5727,1.3282,0.431,1.9144,1.1703,2.4866,1.375,6.7466,3.4074,0.8134,2.7285,5.4578,1.5255,1.7527,0.3996,2.2881,3.1647,5.519,1.7477,3.6644,2.268,4.9243,0.0005,5.3663,1.286,1.9424,0.6732,5.7949,3.3272,2.7527,1.9554,5.7672,0.5029,4.4288,1.7893,3.9645,5.2416,1.185,1.6342,0.3217,5.1735,0.5507,1.6986,0.0003,2.4136,3.848,0.7834,3.7668,0.0083,3.1745,0.3262,4.3887,5.7665,3.9031,2.7833,2.9865,0.3146,0.7625,5.6913,1.384,0.0044,2.3022,4.863,0.8218,1.9578,0.3817,0.7153,3.8591,1.8965,3.8542,4.0605,2.6789,0.0263,4.0286,1.1903,0.6431,0.1752,1.9593,4.391,3.0768,1.7603,2.1715,0.4874,4.3484,1.2102,3.3936,0.7448,4.4175,4.1698,3.3186,1.8286,0.0022,1.1276,3.3804,3.1763,1.2891,1.0642,4.8082,2.0521,5.8242,3.5907,1.393,1.7931,4.4813,0.181,0.08,4.2141,4.2193,3.2683,2.0355,3.8314,2.1858,5.169,0.1423,2.6122,1.5421,1.4541,3.8656,0.9473,1.0785,0.8746,0.0003,2.9663,1.7493,2.2206,2.6516,1.6262,4.3631,0.772,2.816,5.1287,1.3526,0.8222,1.1684]}
{"id":2569,"ended":true,"length":514,"gen_text":"Though Mala struck Myanmar as a powerful cyclone, early warnings and proper evacuations minimized loss of life along coastal areas. Additionally, no major storm surge was reported, limiting the potential for catastrophic flooding in coastal areas in the coming days.\n\nIn the immediate vicinity, four ships were sent to investigate the wreckage of the Rabiyan aircraft.\n\nThe Rabiyan aircraft landed at Pongi Road near the town of Jadavpur during dawn Monday evening after being flagged down by the Ministry of Transport in the state-of-emergency. Due to the absence of any visible debris in the immediate area, the Ministry of Transport has notified the local authorities that the aircraft has been returned to normal operation.\n\nIn the initial stages of the search with an aircraft number of 957, eight boats, nine motorcycles, 40 buses and the helicopter, rescue ships received the same number of rescues along with the aircraft and are currently underway searching for passengers inside.\n\nThe aircraft crashed about 3.30 pm, and there were no deaths and the aircraft's remains have been recovered.\n\nEmergency teams remained in touch with the aircraft's family in Pharaon and on the way further from the wreckage found out the search began on Wednesday. Several helicopters from the Kachin police force arrived in the vicinity of the Rabiyan's wreckage. The helicopters returned two hours later with the latest information on the aircraft's location. At 9.15 pm the Rabiyan's civil aircraft was lost in port. The crew had planned to leave the debris at Pharaon as they had lost contact with the aircraft prior to the crash and were unable to leave the coastal area of Pharaon at that time. The helicopters then took over the rescue operations for Nauru and in the evening the helicopters joined with an army and the PDP authorities in their search zone.\n\nThe Rabiyan's civil aircraft landed in an area north of Thangakay at about 11 p.m. local time.\n\nTwo other PDP authorities and three Kachin police boats are now in contact with the Rabiyan's relatives in Pharaon over the issue of how the aircraft had been dispatched. Two of the Kachin and Thangakay police boats are conducting an underwater search area, while a PDP police helicopter is in contact with a rescue team in Thangakay.\n\nLocal police have been dispatched to Pharaon's area to help with the search. The authorities have also ordered that all search vessels be brought under direct and regular monitoring by helicopter to ensure visibility for helicopters and helicopters in the area.\n\nIf the Rabiyan's civil aircraft is found after 24 hours, it could be re-classified as a rescue aircraft only. The aircraft's disappearance should be addressed and the authorities send an urgent alert to the public where possible. The PDP also has the responsibility for the area for determining exactly how best to proceed.","token_len":601,"entropy":[9.9562,4.2518,8.2283,15.8065,3.5159,1.0283,6.5032,11.9896,0.0131,1.4912,8.6266,3.5963,3.8934,9.5786,2.8836,0.0081,12.8617,7.0152,0.2122,0.0855,6.6821,5.5811,2.0208,1.1424,8.3109,0.0202,5.025,1.9506,5.4167,1.4505,1.322,1.1071,2.4754,7.2868,0.7036,2.3969,0.2546,4.0378,1.5831,1.9516,2.2774,0.3056,3.7732,0.7871,2.1943,0.2068,0.4081,0.36,0.0005,3.1954,1.4272,4.2951,3.6879,2.0354,5.7009,4.4477,1.6181,3.5285,0.3549,4.523,1.1624,5.5175,0.4722,0.7891,4.9703,4.346,2.7241,5.3113,2.2381,2.1074,0.0004,1.7624,2.8776,0.0028,0.0308,1.2644,5.0327,1.8312,5.2414,4.3956,3.1996,5.455,3.4304,1.6379,3.1727,0.0321,4.6049,4.5207,4.1303,1.0989,5.1829,5.4518,5.1372,3.8973,3.6271,1.9175,5.3366,0.5798,0.2181,1.567,4.844,0.0134,2.3699,3.6982,1.9078,3.8292,4.0462,2.7335,0.0022,1.8016,0.0069,0.8357,6.6319,0.0027,0.977,5.2291,0.0034,1.1894,5.4253,1.9132,2.8749,0.2219,3.4106,1.5005,0.1688,1.0196,2.059,0.3298,0.3389,2.3017,5.0899,0.76,2.4212,1.0499,2.292,1.4755,0.6084,2.0224,0.5914,4.269,0.1274,4.2058,1.9113,0.3256,0.4141,0.0002,3.5097,0.9797,5.2667,1.7174,0.2087,0.5005,1.9118,7.5161,4.1531,2.5908,4.7772,0.3098,4.6948,4.0828,0.6567,5.5844,4.1193,2.201,4.1321,5.7383,0.7488,5.6818,4.908,0.8049,4.8747,4.2829,1.9749,4.8779,5.3481,4.6409,3.2237,4.3812,0.9256,0.0519,2.448,0.4425,4.3888,1.5348,1.8942,2.4223,2.6626,5.4477,2.5241,4.8398,3.0483,0.6365,4.9575,5.3999,2.0274,0.5383,0.0002,1.5281,3.2442,4.8433,3.7542,2.8702,0.6949,1.0726,1.2339,2.764,3.7306,3.8386,0.7941,0.2131,3.9979,3.1036,3.7187,1.4198,3.0926,5.2887,2.9415,0.5369,0.78,0.606,0.7502,0.0002,4.8092,3.5762,5.9395,1.5032,3.5981,0.1443,0.6703,3.4091,1.4792,4.6108,3.1574,5.0656,4.6693,1.8503,2.7131,4.5268,1.2522,4.2489,5.6043,4.8314,0.6044,3.1414,4.5288,4.0715,1.878,5.4138,5.6154,2.3811,2.8702,0.9929,6.243,3.5622,3.54,0.5777,5.2515,2.5239,0.7904,5.0593,2.9811,3.4812,1.8969,1.1471,2.3394,0.9165,0.2282,2.1885,0.0031,0.0188,4.7133,1.4357,1.3358,2.6171,1.843,4.4344,5.2021,0.8252,0.1187,2.011,1.4233,5.0724,1.0723,2.8512,0.2996,1.4705,0.9118,2.1875,0.5482,5.4672,4.2469,0.4134,2.8826,0.303,2.9603,3.5963,0.0052,0.0131,1.1208,5.6997,1.8437,1.3644,5.2829,1.6524,6.0116,1.4049,2.1211,5.3328,3.6997,5.7551,0.1528,3.762,0.9621,5.4156,2.38,3.1557,0.0159,0.0007,4.411,2.3736,1.7082,5.786,0.9294,0.1012,0.5144,0.7183,4.9253,0.0425,1.1501,1.5578,2.738,1.7338,1.9115,0.0046,4.1397,1.06,5.795,0.5687,3.3112,1.6637,0.0029,0.0005,3.3055,1.5953,0.0901,0.2483,2.2634,4.8437,2.839,3.0815,2.7946,0.9304,3.006,2.1951,3.0383,6.3008,4.8084,0.0015,1.3495,4.939,1.0771,4.6502,2.5581,3.1327,5.6141,2.6529,5.213,3.6393,4.1453,2.3359,5.4421,3.6931,5.1613,1.7607,4.8697,0.3931,6.9852,0.5954,0.4618,0.0002,1.3863,2.4763,0.0055,0.0108,0.8059,1.6192,0.3251,4.4664,1.9261,4.9398,0.3491,4.6123,0.0772,5.0467,3.8183,3.9234,5.309,3.6158,1.967,2.5303,4.856,0.0004,0.0003,0.2115,2.1756,0.0091,1.1219,1.917,0.0002,4.9687,3.4507,4.7944,0.0415,4.9293,2.8815,3.5955,4.6335,0.0263,0.0245,0.7376,1.8824,3.3519,3.229,1.4776,1.7794,0.042,0.1966,1.738,0.0023,0.0058,0.3565,3.9661,1.4522,0.4854,0.0017,0.0003,6.052,0.1956,4.2772,0.2215,5.0692,1.4534,0.5457,4.3426,1.0156,3.7668,0.88,4.6283,1.4787,0.5532,2.1823,0.0012,0.0041,3.9674,3.1028,0.0288,0.0031,0.0666,1.4291,0.1943,1.3039,3.9654,2.2715,3.9372,0.4624,5.7788,3.0343,1.2632,3.3192,2.8367,0.0071,1.6854,2.1953,0.7858,2.5362,1.1561,0.0378,3.0586,3.9264,1.7138,1.2981,2.771,0.1225,0.0151,0.0042,0.458,0.5245,0.0002,5.5426,2.9349,2.4903,2.2687,3.4002,0.2968,2.6587,0.0038,0.0005,3.7765,4.3854,1.2976,3.0001,1.6854,0.4485,0.4252,1.206,1.7686,4.6167,1.1669,1.4661,3.836,3.0396,1.5863,3.1653,1.6725,2.2903,3.5188,2.3521,5.0186,4.0527,3.3672,4.0577,1.599,3.6366,3.1865,1.1133,5.2127,3.0846,4.823,1.5647,2.6707,2.8207,0.6353,0.5613,0.2097,0.4286,0.0002,5.7167,1.6951,1.7372,0.001,0.0064,0.3992,0.5365,0.1225,1.3738,1.151,4.7352,5.5203,0.0841,0.6562,1.433,2.8208,1.2126,5.0573,0.3569,3.7606,0.3229,0.6491,3.4307,0.5591,5.7,1.0136,2.1702,1.8788,1.9318,3.9219,4.5067,0.7964,4.8629,3.0554,1.6455,4.1035,4.7197,2.4711,1.9345,2.4114,0.3274,1.0114,1.6276,5.7445,1.3866,0.4873,2.5301,4.0727,0.0226,4.1663,1.9146,2.6662,2.4,1.7322,1.7627,5.4343,5.0366,5.8741,5.2159,1.6025,5.7808,0.0096,1.6902,1.1472]}
{"id":1791,"ended":true,"length":576,"gen_text":"Despite the sale of 4 @, @ 000 @, @ 000 acres ( 16 @, @ 000 km2 ) to Disston and the skyrocketing price of land, by the turn of the century our community was in need of new homes and green spaces. We needed to add space in the existing public spaces for us to live and work in.\nAn empty lot at the corner of Maud and Senn Avenue, where we would make up our minds about our future after we live inside the parking lot.\nIt is a very good look for us to consider a new property to add to our existing parkland. We have been there, you have seen us, and we can share this space with others who would like to use it as a park but do not have such the opportunity of using it for their own use.\nWith what we have been trying to do in the past month, we thought it would be possible to get around Maud Avenue and the parking lot and help the development of the adjacent land, so there is a new location we would like to locate on top of some of the other land we have recently purchased. We want to help this development as much as get there.\nThe new parking lot, like the one we have been planning, would have to serve as a site where people can bring their cars and other goods, like bicycles which will then be in the parking lot. We will be using our existing lot to provide more space without any additional taxes on parking.\nWe will work with the business community over the next days to address these issues.\nWe also understand that you have a desire to have this same space within Stoney Creek Drive as well as the adjoining parking lot if necessary. In response to our proposal, the Planning Council on February 21, 2012 passed this \"Vision\" that is expected to allow the parkland at Stoney Creek Drive to be located near a portion of the new development.\nIn January 2012, we submitted our feasibility study for this new development. It was approved. The site at Stoney Creek Drive was proposed with the following options given above.\n(1) The land would be leased to the development at the site of the proposed use at night.\n(2) The site would be used by a community with mixed feelings regarding parking and the value of a residential space. We would lease this site to the development.\n(3) The parkland would be moved to a new location along with additional parking to help make the space available for our users to take their cars. This would allow additional parking and it would be accessible to some of our users for this purpose.\nSince the proposed use by the development was only in relation to parking, we had to consider more options to ensure our use does not negatively impact the parkland. We agreed all options would require a cost associated with the project. It is a difficult decision and it also has the potential to negatively impact the use of the new parkland.","token_len":602,"entropy":[2.0585,8.3778,0.5165,7.4635,12.5387,7.3196,3.8147,13.8494,5.7977,1.4848,1.2426,1.6192,10.9291,4.0341,9.7539,5.7211,0.8798,1.9495,0.4847,7.0978,2.5539,0.9635,1.6733,10.5822,8.6791,3.1484,3.3842,11.5245,1.5322,0.0043,2.1217,0.4859,5.8341,1.7143,6.6155,1.8014,5.1985,0.0079,0.0811,0.5364,5.6228,5.3283,1.6835,2.9846,3.3638,0.0934,3.5597,2.0716,1.7972,5.5815,0.897,0.5044,2.724,3.2493,1.8193,5.1062,4.6994,3.6878,1.3616,4.5911,5.0181,1.1541,3.534,5.0636,0.4593,2.2197,1.5053,0.4468,1.3372,0.7931,1.6079,8.8597,5.731,2.6295,2.3749,1.5469,2.1273,0.0439,5.5936,5.3159,3.2374,4.9095,5.0946,5.0575,1.886,3.813,1.7343,3.6277,5.4589,4.3397,1.5816,4.5602,1.8072,2.7779,0.683,6.2796,3.0984,5.8636,6.5332,1.6523,5.8214,0.2368,0.8759,1.1366,4.4253,1.9667,1.9875,3.5043,4.0395,4.3895,2.6876,1.9669,1.1924,5.4021,2.7842,1.3527,4.923,3.1414,3.9242,0.7328,0.4911,2.7683,4.6072,2.3209,0.9822,2.1416,2.1625,2.469,4.4929,2.4549,5.3597,2.4707,1.2711,2.53,2.0138,2.2179,1.5219,3.6702,5.6779,2.2395,2.6205,0.4183,2.2878,2.6198,3.3665,0.4231,0.2574,2.8734,0.2804,2.119,0.6428,2.9184,5.879,2.871,0.0187,1.2969,5.6211,4.9191,3.7584,3.8798,2.7832,0.5752,1.7389,1.2719,0.4417,1.1288,0.2079,0.8422,4.8126,6.1243,0.7493,0.5444,3.1728,6.3174,0.1698,0.8808,2.4747,0.9873,0.7177,4.5066,0.9133,0.7858,4.8129,1.1439,0.6601,0.0458,4.3626,0.1413,3.4217,3.9953,5.0085,0.0036,2.2177,1.5058,2.38,2.4944,0.1303,2.6927,5.0385,2.9028,4.8746,0.6482,1.7212,4.7998,3.3888,3.2706,2.8838,4.9292,1.0731,1.3012,3.2642,3.7917,4.0997,2.009,0.2417,0.0561,5.8241,3.0624,4.5406,0.0548,5.6782,0.9437,0.4294,3.3043,3.7048,1.2715,0.8783,5.2092,1.0755,0.6901,2.0796,3.3935,0.2304,3.2078,4.3841,1.732,3.3143,0.641,0.0204,9.0942,4.9336,1.1747,0.5886,2.2399,3.2448,2.4541,0.1452,3.3398,5.5724,1.0913,1.8456,1.1731,0.9186,1.7486,2.7857,1.3575,1.6596,2.9576,2.1194,6.1167,1.087,0.4903,5.562,3.7833,2.4739,1.1044,4.7688,0.6323,2.8487,1.2064,3.1327,2.7525,2.6649,4.0639,2.8493,7.3098,3.4207,3.5759,0.3038,4.8697,1.1014,1.5553,0.0496,0.7859,1.7978,3.2797,1.6068,2.7881,3.607,1.6003,2.9246,1.4296,2.7114,3.6982,1.0746,6.7579,3.3668,2.3363,4.2045,3.0687,3.2778,1.0823,0.8481,1.4386,2.2062,4.8524,0.5358,1.1058,5.8546,1.9075,6.39,0.4686,0.3943,7.1414,0.839,5.4715,3.147,0.7407,1.0598,1.3206,1.3711,3.6127,5.6507,0.4341,4.0119,2.101,2.6348,4.2641,0.2657,2.7861,3.7188,5.8222,1.4038,4.2818,6.536,4.3842,0.4499,5.5598,3.0418,1.2422,0.8682,2.3081,4.6429,1.9373,0.1933,5.2754,3.9738,0.3265,4.3751,5.4744,0.2814,2.6422,3.7073,0.8219,2.2907,4.2931,4.2777,4.8921,4.4252,3.63,0.8361,2.9692,4.3257,4.29,5.6799,4.5676,2.0932,2.0675,3.6454,5.0393,0.0539,3.4102,2.0128,4.9553,1.5013,5.4319,2.392,0.0795,0.0037,0.0875,0.163,0.5007,5.0874,4.3499,2.8295,4.7705,0.021,0.7215,3.5094,2.6542,1.2806,0.9228,3.4473,4.3194,1.9838,0.4369,1.4562,3.0959,1.8345,5.7946,0.3775,1.4521,2.7585,2.3635,0.8098,1.5264,2.5054,1.1514,3.1758,4.0298,1.9651,4.2391,3.3984,0.5132,0.048,0.0004,0.0147,1.4824,3.6746,4.8633,1.3586,2.468,4.0601,6.3591,5.9289,1.7533,0.6103,4.4293,0.4708,0.0294,2.0512,3.7648,1.4287,0.4161,4.3903,1.0921,1.5525,3.4134,4.3324,1.6168,3.0653,0.9652,0.8641,2.0878,4.9705,4.2227,5.9475,1.2371,1.035,0.2267,0.0388,0.0015,0.5655,2.9232,0.521,0.3201,2.4372,2.9724,2.1672,3.3059,3.8778,5.4901,4.463,3.1546,2.5323,1.6063,2.5488,5.2669,0.1211,3.495,4.8982,2.5459,0.7081,3.3834,1.3407,4.1716,2.3228,2.9875,0.9596,1.422,0.6022,3.1532,0.5346,0.1918,0.0126,0.0014,0.5663,4.4448,0.8019,0.3179,0.2923,5.3261,0.8442,1.0479,1.4212,1.5956,3.7401,1.1534,4.8029,1.0263,3.1476,3.9199,3.7798,1.6914,3.4259,1.8863,0.6152,3.8472,4.8099,1.8384,4.4592,1.7055,1.9913,2.2381,2.7921,1.3107,2.0953,5.2416,1.3144,2.8272,5.4387,0.1665,1.5009,4.5005,0.7297,5.0338,1.1547,0.5978,1.5571,4.1395,5.6059,1.1084,0.1988,0.4019,6.8217,1.5562,2.5544,2.1436,5.3684,0.8376,0.5128,2.405,5.2425,3.4647,4.4624,0.0018,1.8873,0.7609,1.2984,3.6186,0.8798,2.3945,5.2127,1.7847,2.5239,2.9314,3.5092,2.6462,4.403,0.0177,3.7621,0.3057,1.0307,2.7,0.575,0.5724,1.8563,4.9053,6.9354,1.5735,1.8774,4.9836,1.8151,4.8233,4.9726,0.0467,0.8452,2.5834,0.8639,4.2844,1.1589,2.8898,4.0346,1.0139,2.2972,2.6368,5.3724,2.6161,2.6435,0.8278,0.1059,2.0295,0.2648,0.6716,4.3319,0.2591,0.5683,3.6944,2.2834,0.2096,0.486]}
{"id":4786,"ended":false,"length":576,"gen_text":"Recalling the demon Azazel's comments about the recently resurrected Sam in the episode `` All Hell Breaks Loose, Part Two `` \u2014 that what came back may not be `` one hundred percent true,'' but one that could be true to those who've viewed the show over the last ten years. In short: for any fans of the Azazel's, the series' most powerful, most potent, most complex show is nothing short of an over-the-top, all-out and utterly thrilling drama.\n\nIt is a very good show\u2014it is so unlike anything on television. The show is a story about how the past goes, and with so much emotion and character development and a very unique atmosphere, it is incredibly good looking, engaging, deeply tragic with a strong sense of what happened to our heroes long before we were there. It is more true to its place than anything else on television, and this was an excellent show, but it also had the great quality of a show that can be bought on Netflix, and there's a fine line between telling a story based on real events that are being told and making it good enough to hold its own.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nI know I have already spoiled a few episodes of the show, and that was probably just too much for some of you. But to give you some examples, this is the most obvious way to watch the show:\n\nYou do not need to be a fan of the show to enjoy the story. There is nothing on Netflix that lets anybody over the age of 55 or over that isn't already watched. That's a huge plus, but it's a huge drawback, and it is something that the very best shows tend to give, and I can't help but agree with you. Watching this makes this show much better, because at the beginning, the show is at the very beginning of your career as a director. It is, in fact, far more like directing a movie than anything on television, because you will not be watching it during the course of the director's day. It's actually far simpler, and it will be much more enjoyable. I've been amazed by how much it makes me want to watch more.\n\nOf course, you did not watch it. This isn't what you should do on a Sunday, or what you should do on a Saturday. This is what your favorite shows give you, for sure, but that just means you will now have to learn about their plot and what they do to make you enjoy it. As a reviewer of the show, my wife watched my review of A Clockwork Orange this past summer, and I think it was worth seeing her go through it on that day, and so I can't complain. I just have to say that the story was fantastic. I like the set-up. I like the way the show plays with characters, and it also has the nice amount of laughs for everyone watching.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement","token_len":602,"entropy":[8.519,1.2607,10.0293,10.5172,1.8123,2.8455,8.0588,1.5259,1.8079,8.272,5.2962,7.5276,6.7129,1.2489,3.5333,9.6677,11.1527,5.7351,2.3116,0.0324,2.3289,0.0244,2.4263,1.6628,3.2363,2.1131,6.5381,4.2539,6.7953,5.6318,2.5958,6.6812,1.9675,0.6599,8.7358,5.7402,5.0232,0.2598,2.0127,1.7094,0.9576,4.2209,3.1365,3.2004,1.2552,3.8498,4.666,4.7604,0.389,4.2484,5.7269,0.8205,2.2974,3.4637,0.2491,1.3326,3.6458,0.2424,0.5378,3.3565,4.3602,2.3176,5.5961,4.372,4.8667,0.5341,0.6724,5.77,0.0117,3.321,2.2955,2.2202,3.4958,3.2154,2.8211,4.3105,2.9775,2.2631,5.8176,1.2502,0.433,4.9657,3.481,2.2698,5.4944,1.0523,0.0005,3.1322,3.9521,1.5111,0.9965,0.0035,0.0072,2.3925,4.8291,0.1052,0.9793,6.062,2.9165,5.1974,4.7209,0.5708,1.611,0.0016,3.5348,2.3558,2.4404,4.8249,2.9346,0.9213,6.2738,3.2124,1.779,4.2578,4.9716,0.9666,3.0307,0.4387,1.771,2.5049,2.3738,1.3012,2.7647,3.8978,1.5174,3.4461,1.9522,5.0684,5.3055,2.4548,1.4097,5.5371,4.5931,0.5887,4.3493,1.0983,5.2809,1.2823,2.9803,3.6575,3.4741,4.0252,5.4326,0.9188,1.1472,1.3017,4.7579,5.1268,6.6067,1.8693,4.665,0.7991,5.0361,5.8135,6.6535,1.2402,3.2365,1.5731,0.0116,5.6618,3.6526,1.5408,4.3834,1.9402,6.4788,0.8555,2.5003,2.6426,3.1707,0.3521,1.7689,0.7151,5.6995,5.6075,0.6058,2.7273,4.7137,1.6987,2.2184,0.7321,0.6806,0.2716,1.159,0.6934,4.1239,4.1196,3.5862,3.5294,1.6871,2.6091,2.5473,0.9279,2.6732,3.0113,3.0202,5.1131,4.4801,0.333,2.6693,2.0773,1.088,3.8994,1.3681,5.3749,2.1161,3.1973,1.628,1.2495,4.045,1.9156,1.6292,5.805,0.1862,0.1749,5.4401,1.1133,1.1931,5.2274,0.2465,2.7864,1.3742,2.7724,2.0668,4.5956,0.5753,1.2855,3.4495,1.3611,5.3328,3.1357,0.587,5.0265,2.1404,0.1497,1.3521,0.9226,0.0002,3.0417,3.7168,0.1159,0.0002,3.3482,3.8213,2.0932,3.073,5.0279,5.7743,1.8149,1.9378,3.3548,1.1386,1.3292,0.8366,0.856,1.9639,3.0031,4.2652,2.8841,4.3939,4.6058,0.2663,1.3462,2.1195,1.0276,0.154,1.0125,1.2309,4.388,3.4914,0.3387,2.4754,3.7278,1.181,3.91,1.1617,1.5512,3.7006,5.5991,3.8806,0.7501,3.024,1.0587,0.7058,1.0673,1.2492,0.0001,3.8186,5.5043,0.4599,1.4298,0.3684,1.9802,0.787,0.9918,0.2191,0.9057,0.4312,0.4498,1.3373,1.3817,2.601,0.8267,3.0142,0.9955,2.5881,4.1156,2.0377,0.4406,6.0582,7.29,5.3106,0.6522,0.0095,0.0052,5.0523,2.8106,2.1913,5.9335,4.4168,0.0006,3.1433,4.9179,1.2619,4.2458,0.9609,2.5574,2.2062,2.1029,1.426,3.1387,1.1597,1.106,2.569,2.5058,2.5234,2.035,1.5784,1.5943,2.4298,2.9205,0.6652,3.0291,6.4393,1.511,0.9388,4.5558,0.0697,4.7839,4.9779,1.2126,2.2889,3.371,0.7917,2.665,0.0964,2.9564,0.5606,1.3346,0.8367,5.4654,1.9827,6.3642,4.5118,0.5079,3.8581,1.9194,1.4599,2.0658,4.7514,1.0788,3.7694,1.8643,2.0567,1.7017,1.2345,5.78,1.8902,2.3674,1.8107,0.4474,4.2778,4.1927,2.1817,0.3395,5.1891,1.496,1.8318,1.5372,3.5277,1.8088,1.3285,0.0022,5.8934,0.8404,3.9627,6.8519,1.6303,1.2186,0.667,2.7814,4.2048,0.8032,1.6093,1.8109,1.5939,4.6184,2.5978,1.3264,3.0861,1.3649,6.0564,1.0678,2.471,0.0084,1.9496,5.9847,0.1381,3.0413,1.0216,2.2543,1.6745,4.4885,4.8763,5.2684,1.7996,1.1247,1.936,3.7938,1.6998,1.6776,0.8696,2.2019,1.7202,3.9411,2.913,2.585,5.5966,1.5966,0.7593,1.507,2.9289,2.8657,1.3698,2.2537,0.0288,0.8944,3.0379,2.5263,0.8669,0.0002,4.7756,0.0263,0.219,2.5708,6.5329,0.9327,2.2528,2.3104,1.9639,3.8391,3.6055,0.0005,4.3496,1.4749,2.2427,1.8392,4.9202,1.5776,2.061,2.7125,1.8219,3.6456,0.752,0.2133,0.8519,0.882,0.3164,1.3208,0.8752,2.1293,0.1919,0.6293,4.155,3.9818,1.5695,5.7676,0.0838,1.499,5.1949,2.4641,1.2273,0.6558,3.5821,6.0609,1.5003,1.1546,2.4201,6.1388,1.3892,0.6553,4.595,3.238,4.358,3.9876,1.4609,3.6594,1.5507,2.1269,2.5107,1.9487,1.8645,3.8889,1.8213,0.8005,4.5207,1.8471,5.2807,1.1172,1.2768,0.4071,0.5134,4.515,4.406,5.8034,5.4881,2.8549,1.7082,6.2242,4.2917,0.0013,6.014,1.6747,2.9164,0.8061,0.3143,1.1784,3.6518,1.7658,1.4997,3.9762,4.7688,2.9589,3.155,1.2832,1.8959,4.4834,3.4546,1.7538,2.1653,2.8102,4.5947,0.9764,3.8514,0.9348,3.1812,0.6958,2.2705,3.955,3.6666,0.2994,1.0599,0.6198,2.3455,3.3469,2.8378,3.844,1.1846,2.0288,4.663,1.2494,5.644,3.1245,0.4131,2.3421,1.344,0.4416,0.3985,2.7118,0.7517,2.7519,2.9056,2.1466,2.3608,1.1362,0.9625,2.2982,4.5267,2.0278,2.2005,4.5864,4.1621,0.0016,5.8706,4.6426,4.626,4.4312,0.6689,1.7794,0.0002,1.3821,0.0274]}

We know that salmon are plentiful and they're vital to the ecosystem, and we need to increase those numbers.\"\n\nMeadow said in response to the idea that salmon fish would contribute to local food security, the Fish District would like to see more local and regional food security.\n\n\"This comes after years, and years, spent monitoring the effects of salmon fishing and looking at other fish species in watersheds at the beginning,\" Meadow suggested. \"We are really happy that we've worked with the Fish District, where we've been working on salmon farming for decades, so there's been a lot of interest from the local communities in this idea and we're excited about the fish that could be fed, but you know we could bring them in and continue salmon farming, because not all of them will be coming in and taking up land. That's the issue. This isn't what's right.\"\n\nThe Lower Adams Fish District recently approved legislation to improve access to and food security for salmon. The Lower Adams Board of Supervisors has voted on the legislation for final legislative approval.\n\n\"The fish are more than welcome to come in. We feel that they, along with many other fish, are a valuable resource in the ecosystem that's vital to the quality... if we keep talking about that [concern],\" Meadow said, adding that the fish have already made a big difference to the region.\n\n\"There's actually an abundance of salmon there... we can show people what it looks like to fish in the water for salmon,\" he added.","token_len":602,"entropy":[11.1374,2.1642,1.5846,1.9939,9.1733,13.0683,8.7256,6.7133,8.2716,4.4671,13.0691,1.4392,1.8976,9.8396,1.7693,9.4316,1.0449,6.9142,4.4353,4.9878,3.5997,3.8688,1.1403,3.8659,8.3547,0.4434,6.3626,9.3352,3.9396,0.912,10.8347,11.1329,6.705,4.8675,4.6267,4.7304,1.5605,0.0175,0.1384,4.2424,2.2006,0.297,0.002,0.0495,5.5856,4.4236,0.207,0.0003,0.8615,4.7062,4.9027,3.6024,3.2485,5.1582,5.2165,0.9818,6.0595,0.8192,5.592,1.8104,2.9813,5.9193,0.6232,3.6112,5.5268,4.787,0.1069,0.0007,0.0274,5.5278,5.8914,2.4243,3.5391,0.6005,5.045,1.361,1.2431,4.0305,2.6354,0.2554,0.0008,0.6765,5.0772,4.3222,3.5126,0.5162,0.4287,3.8127,0.0429,5.7292,5.8426,3.5875,5.9202,1.4678,6.248,1.6456,5.51,7.2117,4.3155,4.7067,1.2739,2.3578,0.146,6.3315,5.6759,0.0278,0.2067,1.444,4.9284,0.6536,1.4997,0.0161,4.88,5.9077,0.4623,4.9511,0.4744,2.5172,2.758,3.7196,5.2826,0.458,1.7278,1.1635,5.3946,3.2833,4.8568,3.1618,2.3926,1.3874,5.3826,1.4521,3.454,0.0146,3.2003,1.7294,0.7741,0.0003,5.2124,1.1848,5.6806,4.0295,3.1297,2.7076,5.1968,2.9485,4.7565,3.7013,1.2102,3.6584,0.2199,3.4453,2.9245,4.085,2.5937,5.7088,3.1815,4.7107,0.7085,1.6791,0.0312,5.9531,1.989,0.2285,5.1697,6.3115,2.6634,1.9454,5.4458,0.8214,0.0871,1.6716,6.3749,0.5543,3.7492,3.1357,0.8726,0.4837,5.6842,0.5961,0.5717,0.0002,1.1541,1.5901,5.6616,0.6415,1.4286,3.724,0.833,2.2322,5.2262,2.4714,1.6367,0.4076,0.8866,5.4878,3.529,3.2255,3.8739,3.1297,3.3592,1.9139,2.0609,1.5577,2.8102,0.1817,0.2306,5.2565,3.3899,1.5452,1.2606,1.0226,3.7534,1.3173,0.5722,5.7537,4.8277,4.6563,4.239,0.8181,5.9452,0.55,0.6234,0.4779,6.0852,3.6263,0.8893,2.0278,0.1891,0.3531,1.3177,0.6723,2.7193,2.8146,3.6872,3.8788,5.7626,0.1436,1.5556,4.6547,2.7639,1.5722,2.8234,0.9614,2.1137,0.2688,2.9696,0.7492,1.6432,1.425,1.9096,4.7987,2.1638,2.7817,3.8935,1.0732,3.6528,4.4514,4.4513,1.618,0.1013,0.0002,3.059,3.5624,1.0275,5.0281,5.3348,3.9059,1.1728,3.7223,3.0909,1.7665,1.8439,0.2524,0.0601,6.0475,2.3698,0.7416,3.8176,2.6571,0.1175,4.5082,1.6881,0.8322,4.197,0.8707,1.8224,3.4525,1.1647,1.9901,1.6084,4.4696,1.2571,2.2367,0.6419,5.6711,0.6304,1.3441,1.3232,1.688,1.3764,1.0712,2.6914,0.1372,4.7921,3.9755,1.3016,1.7753,0.1062,0.0002,5.7423,4.4512,0.6385,1.779,4.7584,3.7466,0.1315,0.584,5.3748,1.1782,1.9518,5.0248,1.9999,5.8002,0.2967,4.3829,2.6175,0.7498,0.439,0.8924,1.6332,5.5217,2.9399,4.7314,0.1812,0.7908,1.7316,4.6041,4.1865,1.3565,4.3032,2.4992,1.6035,0.3283,0.0002,0.3286,3.3032,6.3354,2.9505,1.6785,5.7395,2.5517,0.7134,0.8387,4.4074,5.5496,1.6141,4.3266,0.3832,1.3061,0.6946,1.8097,3.7026,0.1712,3.8969,3.1614,1.0893,2.4587,5.1588,0.051,6.2426,1.2501,4.954,2.5236,6.3286,7.7273,0.1276,0.2263,1.2243,3.2523,4.2088,3.9598,1.5948,1.1042,2.2052,4.1292,1.2118,0.9463,1.0226,0.0269,2.5103,5.6407,0.6812,1.48,1.5691,1.5884,2.2894,1.6845,4.3226,1.1828,2.8643,0.6632,3.7856,3.3108,0.5602,2.797,1.0366,0.8062,0.1161,2.6374,1.9506,1.6667,3.3862,2.405,2.4661,2.0494,2.2162,2.8197,1.4222,0.8562,1.6837,1.1251,1.6238,3.9713,1.9992,3.957,0.7559,3.3513,4.1093,2.7486,5.4693,2.4005,2.5392,4.8845,5.6029,2.3166,2.4206,1.9048,5.2827,5.1852,0.2829,3.1747,3.4571,6.5685,2.0574,0.9577,1.4034,2.2848,0.5284,3.2488,1.1505,2.2211,4.8624,2.7564,3.8923,1.8496,3.1976,0.5471,2.5057,4.6005,2.6545,4.3349,4.2988,0.0002,5.3347,2.4131,4.3702,2.0627,0.2255,0.0002,2.0878,5.8743,0.0775,1.1058,0.1406,4.2382,2.399,4.3649,1.0164,4.0851,3.96,0.1983,4.161,3.7216,1.066,0.6924,0.8131,1.9219,1.4227,6.0347,0.0667,6.5858,0.1788,1.7543,0.0019,2.6905,3.2396,2.7266,1.004,1.4759,3.3092,5.1057,7.5033,0.5305,0.5541,0.654,0.0002,1.8721,2.2017,1.907,1.659,5.2669,2.3461,4.0145,1.7153,0.869,1.2677,3.544,1.4277,4.7594,1.4281,2.0542,6.9706,2.6942,0.0011,3.8644,0.4031,1.6839,1.6551,1.0732,2.0379,2.5041,0.6675,2.6418,1.0441,2.5341,3.3119,2.742,3.4765,0.4232,0.9275,3.7586,10.4547,6.2276,0.893,4.7265,5.6517,0.1239,3.6363,5.5329,5.5957,0.2179,1.9325,1.5323,0.2148,4.196,1.4108,0.4173,1.0183,1.5434,3.0681,2.3907,3.11,0.9323,2.3732,1.5682,1.7311,0.5884,3.7026,0.8511,0.4861,0.0002,1.3031,3.344,0.721,4.9993,3.4815,2.0992,0.0765,0.7481,4.5804,4.7353,2.8143,3.5134,5.9695,2.9312,2.5915,3.0112,2.6381,0.0007,1.6181,1.5287,1.2433,1.1567,3.2688,5.1615,1.2275,1.739,0.632,1.8425,0.0657]}

Federer's recent tour had a few problems in Europe. In June he lost out to Dan Martin after three consecutive days of tennis games in Italy and France, and won seven matches in five days during a grueling final season, then fell short by a point in his final match after he lost in the final of his second at the Berlin World Open.\n\nFederer hasn't done much since then. The most notable, though, is that he managed to win consecutive singles titles at Wimbledon and a British Open, winning two of each in 2001 and 2003. In 2013 he even won the last three ATP titles by winning consecutive Wimbledon final doubles in the first match of their careers, after dominating the world's top four in the opening three.\n\nFederer isn't getting tired. The only concern about him moving forward is that he isn't enjoying it. When he has had one win in the year, Federer has never been able to make the world's top 10 \u2013 and to do so many better than his first year.\n\nNo one knows exactly who, exactly, is to blame for Federer's abysmal results. He's playing himself out of a job. The Federer mystique and the general weakness in the game \u2013 and the need for him to make tough decisions when he needs them anyway, like when the British Open final against France became a show of strength \u2013 are all the evidence that the man is playing himself out of a job.","token_len":602,"entropy":[8.7948,4.3431,2.4156,7.3693,7.1705,4.7967,3.3551,6.0223,5.8032,16.82,7.5833,7.5611,2.1172,1.3047,2.0933,9.1323,2.2905,0.3898,9.1504,0.527,0.7751,1.6023,2.0634,6.843,1.2663,9.4322,0.3245,2.8561,1.4699,3.0478,1.323,0.3567,4.2551,3.4067,0.0098,1.2687,5.2221,3.3822,0.0231,5.2233,4.2723,4.9924,2.7469,1.023,1.509,2.6434,4.6932,3.2116,0.0228,6.0512,1.1092,2.4586,4.3084,0.0221,2.8665,4.464,3.5471,1.8218,2.6785,5.0004,3.026,3.1894,4.8155,0.0023,0.0001,1.0283,0.8464,1.2947,1.1329,0.2245,1.7218,0.0408,2.4311,5.5364,0.0001,1.1655,3.8312,3.3125,1.1824,4.9793,0.6197,1.1137,4.0791,3.6358,3.6107,0.3015,5.3672,0.3485,0.6856,4.392,0.0014,0.0014,5.6619,5.6493,5.6802,6.1992,2.4536,0.3055,3.4142,1.4301,2.8153,1.7862,1.2803,0.0008,11.7506,6.3131,0.0351,0.0015,0.0469,0.0002,0.0659,0.3487,0.0027,0.0022,0.0058,0.0153,0.0052,0.0003,0.0183,0.001,7.5308,2.8706,0.1927,6.2217,0.2128,0.0075,0.0173,0.0026,0.0175,0.0041,0.0026,0.0024,0.0507,0.0008,0.0034,0.1024,0.0073,0.0003,0.3816,0.0003,0.0015,0.0004,5.3765,2.654,0.0867,0.0022,0.0002,0.0035,0.0005,0.0019,0.0183,0.0004,0.0005,0.0005,0.0097,0.001,0.0413,0.0128,0.0033,0.0029,0.1348,0.0033,0.0017,0.0014,0.0028,0.0047,0.0006,0.0021,0.0298,0.0003,0.0021,0.0053,0.0,0.0011,0.001,0.0009,0.0034,0.0017,0.0026,0.0043,0.0037,0.0006,0.0001,0.0004,0.0003,0.0001,0.0005,0.0883,0.0083,0.0012,0.0067,0.0029,0.0099,0.0032,0.0011,0.0015,0.0003,0.0023,0.0065,0.0008,2.3183,0.0063,1.721,5.3712,1.1175,0.2656,2.9805,1.7626,0.0196,4.8177,3.4969,5.7467,0.6314,3.9348,1.7992,0.0096,0.0102,2.2872,1.1558,0.0,1.0771,6.466,2.6615,2.8183,6.1377,4.0337,5.4285,3.1676,0.9654,0.0154,3.3033,3.1653,3.1628,3.0603,5.7343,1.6237,3.5352,1.4943,2.3285,4.0947,6.2007,1.6209,0.5439,3.0732,2.514,3.4346,0.2548,5.5617,0.5423,3.5789,2.2711,5.5321,1.8486,0.0475,5.4578,3.6939,0.4457,0.9332,0.0002,10.7481,0.0637,0.0004,0.0054,0.0126,0.0033,0.0017,0.162,0.0017,0.0011,0.0028,0.0037,3.2085,0.0268,0.0048,0.0033,0.0029,0.0034,0.0128,0.0037,0.0086,0.0003,0.0011,4.1293,0.0016,0.0013,0.0075,0.0028,0.001,0.0043,0.0028,0.0007,0.0011,0.0013,0.0004,0.0067,0.0011,0.0056,0.0004,0.0011,0.0006,0.0076,0.0012,0.0006,1.0159,0.0017,1.2374,4.6433,5.3996,5.3256,2.475,4.4032,3.716,3.8703,5.1483,0.9239,2.3489,3.6542,0.9625,1.9603,3.9287,0.6157,5.7657,1.1232,4.9606,4.2454,3.9046,4.1851,0.9739,3.3748,5.1306,1.5004,3.8387,2.3864,3.0892,1.3259,2.0335,4.9428,6.2657,2.4923,0.7937,4.2754,1.113,5.0338,1.4049,4.442,0.0001,4.185,5.0274,4.0684,4.5783,3.4128,1.5731,4.1227,2.0075,2.7785,0.7874,2.7676,1.0977,1.1638,4.9642,3.4447,1.7498,2.8496,1.545,1.1704,1.194,2.9542,3.2357,4.8979,1.2953,5.2205,3.7935,1.4711,0.6186,0.796,0.0002,3.0522,0.0022,6.3337,0.0009,5.0874,1.2431,2.7138,2.4922,0.7884,2.5755,4.5565,3.0825,3.6927,0.8298,0.0835,0.6012,1.6409,0.525,6.2483,0.1477,2.4357,6.1583,3.2702,0.5635,1.239,1.065,0.0001,1.4995,3.9212,5.6756,0.1266,2.0848,4.8984,2.9451,1.7853,5.7866,2.0875,5.4112,0.2709,1.587,0.4373,2.5294,4.1948,0.7091,5.7102,2.1531,1.1062,5.0397,2.086,5.5631,0.9857,4.5078,2.987,4.7218,2.2187,0.0008,5.6347,4.3819,3.3119,2.0716,3.0247,3.648,0.7128,4.886,1.8312,1.5743,4.7549,6.2064,1.2616,3.6679,2.6972,1.1228,2.8883,1.7029,1.5504,3.7362,3.3736,2.413,0.6437,0.0002,2.213,0.0031,3.854,0.0004,5.4604,5.5153,2.0642,2.7747,4.2442,5.6299,4.6465,2.1205,6.2615,0.8742,0.2933,1.3321,0.544,4.0016,0.0004,5.4085,2.0676,0.9382,4.6373,0.6855,4.0269,4.1466,4.2174,3.6065,1.1138,1.8147,5.9607,0.7755,4.0477,0.0038,0.8012,3.5517,2.0864,2.8312,0.0023,3.8244,2.3853,5.7535,1.3723,0.8768,3.8589,6.318,2.2624,4.8471,2.6513,0.4044,5.3361,4.3115,1.0804,3.0338,4.032,2.5991,1.02,1.1287,0.0002,5.787,1.6193,2.3331,2.9772,4.6753,4.3969,1.2764,0.0604,1.4032,3.7362,0.0026,0.1586,1.2339,0.0047,0.1254,5.1165,0.1856,0.0113,2.7371,0.9327,2.0452,1.4381,4.7123,4.2808,2.3824,0.1596,1.0853,0.9665,1.2089,2.5678,4.4344,0.008,5.6241,0.0703,4.1259,1.5057,5.9277,5.3436,1.7519,1.0516,2.7673,4.2473,2.313,1.3687,5.6365,0.8987,3.0165,0.0549,4.0344,5.9136,0.9225,3.5184,1.4897,2.8165,1.6544,7.0468,3.1597,3.5232,1.7217,3.5279,5.3009,0.4322,2.3576,3.948,4.5331,4.948,1.4461,5.4369,0.851,1.1214,1.1424,1.4311,2.1294,3.661,4.8317,0.8085,1.9238,3.7383,1.3934,4.4923,0.9289,0.2083,0.0403,0.7352,0.3094,0.2576]}
{"id":635,"ended":false,"length":553,"gen_text":"Because Miami received the ball to begin the game, Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the second half. After Miami's kickoff and a touchback, Tech began the first possession of the third quarter, when it found the back of the end zone while Miami scored a touchdown -- in response to Hogan's second-quarter pass.\n\nVirginia Tech lost to Miami in the first 12 minutes of the second half on field goals.\n\nAfter Miami's third-quarter pass and touchdown, the team looked up in the air on what might have been a 3rd quarter punt, leaving Miami's coach to explain how the ball bounced around. On the play, Hogan had four defenders on his 3rd-and-5 for 11 yards, but Florida State would be held to 3rd-and-8 on a third-and-1, making a diving jump to the Miami 20, which was nearly as effective as an easy run. The ball bounced inside from scrimmage and got caught off the line of scrimmage, where there was no chance of the ball ending up in the top ten.\n\nHogan took a touchback on 2nd down in the third quarter and the ball was bounced from the Miami 20 to the Clemson 17, which Virginia Tech would score on. Duke was responsible for a 2-yard field goal, but Duke's offense was much better playing two different games with only Miami's offense.\n\nAfter Virginia Tech finished the third quarter 6-0, Hogan scored the game winning drive. The game clock remained on in the third quarter. The two game score durations of three consecutive overtime points, each overtime, went into overtime due to offensive fouls.\n\nIt is not necessary to have a three minute clock during the first half on punt and field goal plays. On a field goal, the opponent is given a 45 second clock to run on before the clock is turned on again (as in an overtime game ). On a field goal, the clock is turned off (as in a game two overtime ).\n\nWhile playing at least one overtime short of the last timeout, it is unlikely that Clemson could be counted on to continue winning game, because of the Clemson offense at that point.\n\nIt would be appropriate to acknowledge that any of the Clemson offense was also a unit of defense, not defense.

{"id":4604,"ended":false,"length":557,"gen_text":"In Greece, I Corps was employed as such for the first time. The campaign was another short one, but very trying on the participants. Just three days after headquarters opened on June 7th, the people of the city were mobilized on the 6th to support the Greek Army. In all other respects I feel sorry for those people who didn't get together. The men were mostly of German ancestry with an ethnic 'faggot' bias. As a result they were treated like the 'louts' in the west.\n\nWhen I visited Greece at the 5th Infantry Brigade training base in Mantine, the first trainees of the 6th were in Greece. To this day, I am never able to find any records of Greek volunteers fighting with the 4th Infantry Brigade in an organized or regular infantry battalion. The only records listed are the days of assignment, i.e. the time when the Brigade received orders to proceed southwards during the night, and the number of units which had left, and never returned. I believe we now know how many volunteers fought with some of the infantry teams.\n\nFinally, I came to Athens in the fall of 1945 to receive the German artillery on a training exercise with the 4th Infantry Brigade.\n\nIn 1945 I had a good talk with the commander of one of the German battalions, which was working on the 4th Infantry Brigade. I went out looking for 'the German Brigade', where Germans and Poles had always done training together on both the same day. The two days were held on that day as they had never done in that case. What was fascinating to me was that neither of these groups were involved with the infantry or tank division, but went as follows by taking part in regular battles, and in the evening for the German cavalry. After my return to Greece I was in the 4th Infantry Brigade, but didn't even receive the uniforms of any of them. On June 6th I was part of the 4th Infantry Brigade training at the camp in Parnassus. In case you weren't aware, Parnassus is part of the Turkish Republic.\n\nI had some good talks with the German command about the 2d Brigade, where many of the 1st Infantry Brigade regulars fought alongside the 4th Infantry Brigade, but not the 5th Infantry Brigade, with a detachment of French infantry members and 3 German infantry teams. I guess that was a good indication that we had to pay a heavy price to help our comrades to take up their roles in taking up positions with infantry, tanks and artillery in the army :\n\nThe 4th Infantry Brigade was the best company. We were one of the best German battalions and we were more organized than any other German battalions. Their numbers were very good. During all of March we had 100 men who also served on the 4th Infantry Brigade and at least 10 infantrymen (that is, 2 of whom are still a regular with the 4th Brigade.)","token_len":603,"entropy":[10.0989,0.5741,4.9802,15.5394,3.5907,6.6224,2.1428,8.483,2.454,2.0853,2.5215,0.464,2.0569,2.3929,8.007,1.2279,8.2085,6.8193,1.3754,1.1909,1.6468,6.0598,11.091,5.0216,1.2466,8.0086,0.6822,7.3128,5.0447,2.1777,1.319,9.9717,3.8423,3.4285,3.1742,3.2325,1.3446,0.5442,2.3547,5.6306,1.126,1.8007,2.1187,2.1794,4.5905,3.6866,1.5939,4.4621,0.0231,2.3521,3.8391,0.502,4.4156,2.2245,1.0004,3.0978,4.4882,5.5269,1.6775,2.8102,3.5712,5.6253,0.1594,3.0162,3.4604,0.9352,4.5321,0.0008,2.5496,5.4761,1.946,2.5207,5.2787,2.2259,5.1177,3.959,3.5294,2.8262,5.2937,3.9064,4.7086,6.5786,5.5863,4.2278,0.0081,0.4714,5.2559,0.8901,4.3159,1.5292,0.5828,2.5177,1.0444,4.0437,2.4487,3.9247,2.3865,5.3089,4.8775,0.6029,2.5048,1.0561,5.5365,0.9617,2.6319,0.0827,4.2933,1.2889,3.5977,2.7291,3.8611,0.4574,7.4825,0.0563,2.7714,1.8522,5.8969,2.982,1.2442,5.3549,5.6058,1.1266,2.3915,3.2422,5.3585,0.5941,2.7758,0.42,3.8785,0.0168,2.7855,3.9676,4.146,0.8657,5.5956,2.728,0.0619,1.2728,1.6477,2.13,5.3016,2.1722,0.0024,2.5798,1.7546,4.6303,0.4298,4.4332,3.9811,5.5228,2.8705,0.5593,4.5132,0.0218,0.9345,0.4795,1.9672,5.7672,4.5876,3.3102,4.1231,3.0726,2.6459,0.4617,2.2645,3.1759,2.534,6.9215,1.155,2.3333,5.0391,1.1619,5.9986,1.6309,7.2789,0.0011,0.0008,0.5771,1.5041,2.8191,2.0662,1.0991,4.9365,3.8046,2.8068,1.269,5.5844,5.9224,2.4764,5.6985,0.5641,2.6805,1.8351,1.4073,0.7775,2.1408,0.1314,3.7066,4.0,2.5601,4.3765,3.9813,2.4437,5.537,0.6901,0.6216,2.5363,3.5881,4.8858,5.1393,0.7789,3.0014,0.2759,3.5835,3.0059,1.4142,6.9345,1.31,0.345,5.1416,6.2668,1.6728,1.3228,0.0002,5.7869,0.345,2.0196,3.8287,0.7553,2.2304,2.1461,2.119,3.1635,0.0158,2.9358,2.8199,4.2807,1.7113,4.3277,5.554,4.9128,2.8442,2.7204,2.797,2.882,0.4772,1.963,0.018,0.5716,0.2068,0.4169,3.692,0.0002,2.9398,3.3551,1.7967,2.7708,2.0122,3.8706,5.3392,0.0973,1.6193,2.7837,0.2163,5.759,0.0854,0.3192,2.3515,3.8186,0.0016,1.275,5.2129,1.1045,5.8206,1.2566,1.1721,3.7683,0.0097,0.5815,0.2229,0.8716,2.2173,4.963,3.6287,5.8199,0.0965,5.8466,2.9537,3.0876,5.9168,2.3517,4.4658,5.4955,3.4575,4.2691,2.3783,5.5187,5.662,2.5434,1.3961,4.4882,4.7414,3.545,5.2854,1.4466,0.4235,2.2256,4.8533,4.9648,1.5284,4.6612,2.4813,5.4708,0.7854,3.357,3.6262,2.031,3.9896,2.7306,2.6224,5.2753,5.3969,0.3966,5.6219,2.6348,4.8762,1.7339,0.0712,0.3248,0.8125,5.412,1.0768,2.0165,2.9334,1.9281,4.7836,2.647,0.8363,4.7217,3.2788,5.6613,3.3989,1.9806,1.4997,5.5729,4.7663,5.8799,6.786,5.2908,1.0855,0.1295,5.3193,4.2776,2.8298,2.0728,3.6832,1.803,5.4386,5.4299,1.7868,3.8907,4.2709,0.9893,4.221,4.8258,2.5624,0.8393,1.0593,1.5205,1.9663,3.9561,1.7483,3.7278,0.0061,0.6807,0.2802,2.1653,2.9209,5.2684,0.0008,4.6515,4.4774,1.7982,5.3623,1.1789,3.5574,0.3508,2.6103,0.4204,4.5644,3.4775,2.5474,0.05,1.0236,1.595,5.0613,0.0134,0.6901,1.7482,0.0227,0.4486,0.1903,3.2529,3.0117,1.3659,4.6645,2.0041,3.7984,3.2903,0.9445,0.4089,0.8579,3.3704,5.1642,0.6562,4.1777,0.002,0.3736,0.4421,2.3923,0.0038,0.0069,0.0081,0.6273,3.6463,0.0013,0.7569,4.888,3.4567,1.2183,1.5649,0.0002,2.2866,2.6392,3.8732,3.0505,2.8199,0.0732,0.8041,2.6171,4.14,2.4842,1.0559,4.5085,3.114,2.7274,1.5912,3.7437,4.7017,0.5414,0.4819,4.0399,0.0051,2.0091,0.8384,6.2476,3.5615,2.5681,0.6524,1.6103,0.005,0.3939,0.0883,2.4849,1.9686,3.6569,1.8766,3.4414,0.0075,0.2717,0.0379,2.2431,4.4458,3.1801,5.6162,0.5506,5.0949,2.8754,6.057,3.0719,5.1188,2.2261,2.2729,5.4087,0.457,1.9412,5.6946,2.4145,1.7021,2.2438,1.9501,4.1617,1.2926,3.0613,1.7356,4.7115,5.684,1.6204,1.307,0.1472,2.0773,4.295,3.0916,2.6539,3.6656,4.0364,3.4156,2.437,3.8738,1.5774,6.7016,1.0569,1.069,3.261,4.7356,2.6532,2.0313,0.7411,1.0327,2.3763,0.9283,4.7692,11.9842,3.955,0.0003,2.3438,2.6335,0.0109,0.2241,0.0528,1.6241,3.1274,4.2563,4.909,4.1171,2.4371,1.443,5.0905,0.2429,0.378,1.6675,4.1217,1.4968,0.0001,3.5963,2.3923,1.4246,5.7463,4.3172,0.6153,1.9643,0.6852,1.7854,2.8372,0.0095,0.8543,5.4558,3.8538,0.3827,2.7713,2.1441,1.3661,4.7297,4.6361,2.1988,6.4047,1.8118,1.2381,4.8137,1.1256,3.7806,5.9084,3.3758,2.3439,0.5312,1.2087,0.008,0.4148,0.0522,2.7853,4.6159,1.6967,3.4841,4.0249,2.4655,4.4585,4.7144,1.0261,0.5884,3.5779,3.237,2.4787,3.7551,3.5276,6.0691,4.8019,4.649,0.6379,0.6633,0.0076,3.5924,4.8406]}
{"id":2502,"ended":false,"length":559,"gen_text":"White @ - @ and @ - @ red flags were first waved during a patriotic demonstration on May 3, 1916 in Warsaw. The organizing committee advised participants about the correct alignment of colors and flag for that day's parade to honor the Warsaw nation. The line was crossed around 7 PM with half the lines having white on one side and half black on the other. The line was drawn by volunteers marching under an inverted red flag with the black cross at the end. During the rally, the slogan \"I am your nation and you fight like I'm your country!\" appeared on the wall. In the following days, some volunteers were encouraged to go with the red flag with the black and the white. While doing so, they had to cross a line over a small line of the line of which there were signs reading: \"Tired of a parade that shows up in a hole?\" and \"No more patriotic colors\"\n\nThis incident was not unusual during the time, considering the history of what we call White Ribbon Organization in the United States and the Black Ribbon Organization at the present day during the Civil War.\n\nThe reason that the line in Cincinnati wasn't drawn on the outside was not to show support for the cause of the nation, but to remind people that there were no black or white flags in Cincinnati, even after the line was clearly drawn.\n\nOne question still remains: Why did these flags do not go across the street during the war? Was it just to show sympathy for the national cause of the nation over a simple matter? Do these flags carry as much significance to others as a symbol of patriotism, or are they just a reminder of our history of keeping the flag at large if necessary? Were these flags also the result of spontaneous protest on our part, as in this case?\n\nAs the war dragged on, the flag of the United States of America was being carried on the National Emblem in Cincinnati, even though some members of the National Guard were fighting in the Great Depression over taxes. In June 1916, a number of people gathered in Cincinnati to protest the government's treatment of tea party demonstrators. However, over the course of the war, it was obvious that the National Flag was not something the white majority wanted in America. In fact, some leaders of the National Guard were openly advocating a red and white flag in protest of President Franklin Roosevelt's war plans.\n\nWhat should be done with the N.R. flags now being placed on city streets? I do not think Cincinnati can take away these signs, but if it took away, it would not help the National Torch fight for freedom in America itself.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about this article, please e-mail: russ@washpost.com.\n\nYou can also learn more about the American Heritage National Flag (http:\/\/www.aheritage.org\/) at: http:\/\/www.americanheritage.org\/publications\/the-aheritage-nation","token_len":604,"entropy":[8.5303,7.1844,5.3713,6.4365,1.0975,2.6658,1.0069,9.1291,5.5575,5.3064,7.0682,6.6989,5.2413,2.2893,8.5294,3.6063,2.4846,3.6013,3.4211,0.9316,6.95,2.421,6.1478,1.1889,2.2753,11.1701,1.9916,6.6302,5.0305,6.5128,0.8738,7.9929,8.497,0.29,4.0576,1.6825,4.7532,3.4075,3.8103,0.2975,1.1812,2.4097,4.3453,2.4537,0.8745,5.4743,4.654,0.5003,2.0289,5.7916,1.5192,2.7259,5.9942,4.113,4.9799,2.8725,6.4517,1.7992,4.1201,4.1093,4.3994,3.0655,1.9946,0.0653,0.4702,2.7001,1.1455,0.1095,0.008,0.0027,0.3395,1.5747,2.4596,0.8251,3.8843,3.1482,4.5006,6.5755,4.0052,4.0378,4.3195,2.7585,1.4373,2.6581,1.305,3.7136,4.2311,2.943,0.2812,2.2927,0.5514,4.822,0.3245,4.5078,0.6627,1.7064,5.4073,0.7384,4.082,1.3734,4.52,3.7945,3.2553,1.1755,6.8725,4.0977,3.457,1.7114,0.4438,1.1138,3.5209,4.7298,0.676,0.6571,5.2832,1.2804,3.7613,1.5975,3.7359,1.1065,0.3258,4.4273,3.8728,2.8535,4.7962,0.1286,4.6436,4.8453,0.8677,2.6938,1.2904,4.7534,0.4399,1.9099,3.0526,2.233,1.1219,2.028,5.1446,5.6149,0.2822,0.0816,2.0165,4.2642,0.5725,2.3814,1.7069,2.3805,4.7245,1.7609,4.6604,3.9256,1.325,4.5318,2.0615,3.0181,6.0539,3.303,0.7826,5.1293,2.5248,2.1056,0.6785,5.5669,5.5682,0.2977,4.0747,3.5444,2.8325,5.5482,3.3238,2.6308,2.7516,5.8143,2.3233,1.9164,0.2216,3.4394,3.5023,4.8051,3.1941,4.6257,3.8941,0.0171,4.9903,5.618,1.8194,2.5046,3.6358,4.7366,0.5666,3.8077,4.3495,6.666,1.0671,4.5716,0.1458,6.1482,3.5443,1.7785,6.3882,5.5544,7.7409,2.9579,0.9333,0.8109,0.0119,2.8836,1.345,6.0592,1.9092,0.8525,4.5617,1.2565,5.1519,0.8239,7.2388,0.8826,2.8874,0.3853,0.381,1.3968,0.0005,1.9832,5.4846,2.9772,1.4683,3.3157,4.6178,6.1066,5.8324,0.0013,2.1028,2.8697,1.2326,5.2317,1.1601,3.6698,2.9107,2.03,2.0642,0.2021,0.5687,3.3732,0.582,0.8817,3.4003,1.5024,0.301,0.6386,4.0775,1.274,0.8539,2.7219,1.8281,3.5354,3.6077,2.5198,0.1713,1.4197,1.7974,2.346,2.4703,3.1553,3.2603,0.6784,4.2712,0.4865,6.0145,0.5386,0.675,0.8213,0.0002,4.791,5.6692,5.5118,0.7302,1.0322,2.4581,1.0371,3.8804,3.751,5.9242,1.0963,3.12,4.2369,0.3739,2.0415,3.2143,0.3787,5.6975,0.6304,3.8637,0.3833,3.4908,1.9572,1.2244,4.0925,0.3265,0.4723,5.5616,1.7894,2.1302,0.6322,1.607,6.8853,1.847,4.7929,2.8554,1.749,5.8362,2.6282,0.7431,5.4103,5.6284,0.6253,2.8116,1.5463,6.0696,0.3159,3.2052,1.9711,0.2267,2.626,2.5617,1.7094,2.1649,0.3918,2.2306,1.7074,3.0677,0.6952,3.0605,2.8313,1.7166,5.7548,1.6983,1.8998,3.3272,5.4106,6.9171,4.789,0.2425,6.1194,0.905,0.3381,4.1321,3.9222,3.084,0.0057,6.2121,2.4512,4.2094,3.5585,0.0982,1.6668,2.9137,3.6259,3.2893,0.2432,0.4675,0.5274,0.0003,4.0055,2.4452,4.4146,3.1104,0.0279,0.3015,1.5122,3.8542,2.2261,0.5014,1.027,0.0412,1.5892,0.0049,1.1596,3.1406,4.2222,2.5957,1.2476,3.9448,4.6988,3.3906,2.4724,1.4932,4.1626,0.4509,4.2968,3.1814,0.167,0.406,2.479,2.0103,1.3678,5.1149,1.1799,0.9699,4.6005,3.376,7.2096,6.1699,1.2087,3.0808,4.8229,2.8988,0.1451,2.6361,3.5834,0.0036,2.9347,3.7952,1.207,2.31,0.6836,1.3419,0.6711,3.7389,0.3383,4.6786,0.0205,6.0214,0.6863,3.3174,0.6817,4.7665,0.0287,5.2223,0.5273,2.2809,0.0005,0.4848,2.448,0.2503,3.9305,1.4042,4.1712,0.1993,1.2238,1.7472,1.7596,1.3099,1.4035,5.4306,2.6337,5.8531,4.8241,1.5493,2.9549,2.3986,0.4159,3.3152,0.9044,0.0124,2.6667,5.0298,0.6438,0.2211,0.8792,0.2201,1.681,3.2706,3.8349,3.1033,4.4037,1.5014,0.3405,0.8447,2.7049,4.0964,0.4814,4.6245,4.1243,1.2258,0.2245,3.7168,2.6341,0.6234,0.8543,0.0002,4.2493,4.8926,1.7213,1.8547,2.748,1.0288,6.5454,1.6671,2.4551,0.0133,5.6541,2.9706,1.6528,4.1703,0.9805,4.1042,0.4619,0.8449,5.0297,4.0696,0.144,1.7479,4.3186,3.5502,3.9935,3.0423,2.9531,4.5494,1.9559,1.3739,3.3463,2.3159,5.4488,0.5249,6.2837,1.8403,0.4439,2.459,4.8694,1.1562,3.278,5.8243,5.9336,1.5143,2.6756,2.7352,1.3823,6.93,0.1503,0.793,0.0003,3.9425,1.1518,2.3855,1.4866,0.0391,2.3813,0.0771,0.085,1.8423,3.7147,0.6456,1.332,5.2593,0.0018,0.001,2.6335,4.6013,4.759,1.6629,5.5155,0.1345,0.0667,0.0133,0.9898,0.8655,0.0003,4.6648,0.2335,0.9136,4.4686,0.4606,0.1145,0.8643,4.535,4.3011,3.6988,0.6426,3.9101,2.7066,0.0009,0.3929,0.0004,3.4592,0.2498,0.0144,0.0573,0.1083,2.313,1.9838,1.7023,0.4824,0.0008,0.3603,0.0007,2.8496,0.1185,0.6066,0.0008,0.0053,0.0388,0.1208,4.0629,0.1443,0.0532,3.8125,0.4921,3.3219,0.0106,0.0367,0.101,5.0923]}
{"id":3748,"ended":false,"length":508,"gen_text":"From January 15 to 31, 2016, Carlsen participated in the 78th Tata Steel Chess Tournament, held in Wijk Aan Zee, The Netherlands. Carlsen won the tournament by scoring 9 points, while in the final in the fourth round of the ChessWorld Chess Classic Chess Championships he scored 7. In November 2015 he won the Open Championship in the US, and the Open Championship in the UK as well.\n\nResults\n\nCarlsen has lost four of eleven consecutive games after coming up short of the semifinals.\n\nIn the second quarter he lost 2-0 at the T-Wood, and his third quarter came to him being stopped by Jirai (27:20) and the Russian forward Nikolai Kirovski (26:40). In the last 4 the Americans scored a total of 14 points, while in the final a total of 4 points resulted in the American with 8 points from the round robin (13:26), but in the winner's semis he scored only 3. As part of his solution in the second quarter the Americans found a second option to defend his position at 14.\n\nIn the 2nd half in the third quarter and on the way out from the third he was stopped by Nikolai Kirovski (27:43). He won the round robin, but came back 1-4:1 which was the first loss at the start of the tournament. In the final he scored 15 points, but in the end he had to settle for 6 games.\n\nCarlsen got two points against G.I. Kasparov and one against G.I. Tkachuk.\n\nHis first-round loss came on Dec 17, 2016, when he lost to the Russian player Rolibaktsev in the round robin rounds at the T-Wood. He lost 3-5 in the final but didn't even qualify for the final.\n\nHe managed to win the tournament under penalty for the first time ever over a Russian. In the same year he finished fourth-most often when it comes to wins per round by any Russian player. His first top 10 was by Andrei Aronian. In the same year he was the number two player in chess at the chess grand tour stage (Pachuca won the championship in 2005, and lost the tournament in 2004). When he is in one of the first five rounds at a chess event his win percentage on the board is 20 to 24.

{"id":4670,"ended":true,"length":546,"gen_text":"Hideaway ( 1968 ) ( Contains two Boysie Oakes stories. ) The Assassination File ( 1974 ) ( Contains two Boysie Oakes stories. ) = Jordan Kovacs = Jordan David Kovacs ( born in 1940 in Atlanta, GA ) is an action hero, who can be found in comic form in the upcoming film: The Assassination Files.\n\n. In the film, several characters play key roles, most notably the mysterious Jack-Jack Oakes who was once called Jack-Nee and is the son of Norman Oakes, a local high school teacher.\n\n. J.K. has a significant social status as well as being one of the biggest bullies of all time who can easily get his revenge; he would usually get a head shake or \"doggie\" with one of his friends. If he fails or doesn't make a move on, he is forced to be the hero in the film, which means he's an easy target for bullies, especially the parents, who are probably afraid of losing Jack-I, and not so afraid of losing the kid who had been called Jack-G.\n\nAs a part of his ongoing adventures, Jordan was also able to meet a girl named Rolf who had just arrived to live in Atlanta, where she had been abandoned by her boyfriend. Rolf was the one to give her the power to fight, which was so important to him. He had already started looking for a daughter and Rolf's father was determined to provide for her.\n\nHe would also take on a few more bullies whenever they were needed at the end of any series of stories that he had completed, often to the point where Jordan and Jack-Jack were the very ones that would get him killed by a group of bullies. He was also known as \"Puppet-Killer\" due to the fact PuppetKiller was very popular with the bullies of that era. The most notable bully in the film was The Dog Guy, Jordan's favorite character. Jordan tried to get over him at the end of the film where he finally killed him with a poisoned dart. Puppet-killer is also mentioned in the same movie where Jordan's father, Jack-Jack Oakes, kills him due to the fact that Jordan did not even have any money to pay for food.\n\nHis death, Jordan is also seen in one of The Assassination Files, one of the first major film episodes in the series that has a real character named Jordan after him.

{"id":1590,"ended":true,"length":570,"gen_text":"A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa and across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without significant development. The wave entered the northeastern Pacific Ocean and began to show signs of organized migration across North America in spring of 2007.\n\n\nIt began to show signs of increasing migration in June and November of 2008. It continues to show signs of increasing growth to the end of September 2009.\n\n\nThe tropical storm showed signs of movement over the Caribbean during May and June of 2008 and through mid-June of 2009. Although it continued to show less significant signs of movement from South Florida, North Texas, Hawaii and New Mexico, it stopped moving into the Florida Keys in June of 2008 and the Great Lakes have been moved on to southern Michigan since April 2007.\n\n\nThe Hurricane also showed signs of growing movement over the south Atlantic Ocean. As a result more tropical storms and tornadoes were moved over North America, with little action on the Atlantic side but little damage to Europe and the Gulf of Guinea.\n\n\nThe storm moved to southeastern North America in August of 2008. It continued to show moderate signs of growing movement.\n\n\nThe wind changed significantly during September of 2008 as it began to show signs of moving on a longer stretch of the coast of southwestern North America.\n\n\nThe storm moved to Southeast South America in late October of 2008. When it entered, it moved northward into the United States and then moved eastward into Texas.\n\n\nDuring the winter months, wind speed had moved very slowly as it swept the wind at over 110 mph.

{"id":2387,"ended":true,"length":542,"gen_text":"The video received mixed reviews from critics. Allmovie reviewer Michael Hastings commented that the band `` has managed to stay fresh and inventive after more than a decade together ``, praising their `` solid '70s sound design and quality of production and production budget. The reviewer Robert MacLean criticized the band for '' failing to produce an authentic rock 'n' roll experience in their time, citing their `` long-running rivalry with '83's'' and `` the band's '80s and '90s '' style. The reviewer Patrick Breslin praised the band for their '' clear-sounding but '90s attitude.'' The review for The Quietus band from 1987 read: ` There's a strong but subtle presence in the instrumental and instrumental track ` `. The reviewer Andrew W. Anderson said: `The vocals don't last nearly as long as the more sombre guitar riff, and the rhythm section is sparse but deep.'' The reviewer Jerry W. Allen called The Quietus and the '80s Soundtracks, `a classic in a very modern era'. The author, Richard A. Schmaltz, said: `The Quietus is excellent for a variety of song groups. Not as good as the other band's titles, but does not waste your time. No one needs a whole `80s' track. It's easy to listen to the two band members singing the way they talk, and the vocals stay put. Some songs are really good, and some are not.'' The reviewer Bill W. Hargrove praised the band for \ufffd never complaining as they did about `` being a band of great musicians and music for a long time and enjoying the studio time without having to go back to the old days.\ufffd The reviewer John J. Nelker said, ``I would recommend The Quietus at my own risk, considering all their '80s sound-oriented sound and their sound is very, very good.'' Allmusic reviewer Patrick E. Schmitt praised the quality of the band over Allmusic. The reviewer Robert MacLean wrote, ` Allmusic has been good about their sound, but you have to take care not to offend any of them, because not all of them will be so good when the band comes back in the summer and they make some noise. The band is an original sound, not an imitation of The Boss. The fact that Allmusic is all about old-time music isn't great quality. But if the band's `80s sound didn't really sound like the '70s Soundtracks, then Allmusic certainly should, since it is well crafted but has no great sound in it.\ufffd Allmusic's '90s Soundtracks also featured excellent production, good band harmonies and more riffs (no band guitar riff, only the band's guitar riff, all of these good sounding). Allmusic also have a big '90s sound and it also has catchy guitars (if you're playing rock music, it seems they've got a little more bass).","token_len":605,"entropy":[7.3441,8.3267,5.3189,0.4005,1.8889,2.3694,2.09,7.7735,13.0476,6.0783,4.2527,7.7256,4.8391,1.6398,1.1174,8.3985,12.31,9.3479,6.4382,0.0881,4.3652,4.7727,1.0166,5.3456,6.2057,5.4864,0.0747,1.289,0.0956,6.8429,8.4956,4.5107,6.4861,2.2665,4.4864,6.5007,5.0853,3.7082,0.0155,2.0037,5.6742,0.4892,5.6582,1.1746,2.6599,2.6123,3.9802,4.6067,0.5619,2.5552,2.0511,5.8039,5.7547,2.5676,4.8835,0.6329,1.2035,0.6596,3.651,3.5802,0.0621,4.4428,2.5657,4.577,4.7509,1.3753,0.0147,0.4265,0.0016,3.1258,3.5256,2.7922,2.9649,1.2283,3.9201,1.7171,2.6099,5.9973,1.4908,2.1123,4.2206,0.373,3.6432,6.1046,0.9488,4.7532,2.1547,1.8346,3.4292,1.7213,0.7597,3.6598,1.5686,0.0307,3.9258,0.1931,0.0689,0.0119,4.1052,2.9395,1.2692,1.9051,0.385,5.3505,5.1322,3.7473,1.2278,3.4719,0.3991,0.669,0.3619,1.1707,1.2401,5.7159,3.0234,2.9414,5.8408,4.4539,1.9704,0.0327,5.5273,2.5795,1.7295,2.2879,3.457,2.4212,5.7911,1.8977,5.8689,3.7768,5.7284,4.648,0.647,4.1957,6.3777,1.1998,1.3317,4.6406,4.5146,4.7611,4.6588,0.9441,0.754,6.0239,2.9545,2.1713,4.7287,3.253,3.9911,3.8487,1.5183,0.7078,5.0375,4.5611,1.0559,5.0388,2.1647,2.1979,0.6535,3.4509,4.68,5.5466,0.0925,6.0631,5.3146,0.1177,0.064,0.4099,0.8609,5.9934,5.4548,1.091,0.0295,4.4778,4.0303,1.8729,2.2132,0.9405,5.0169,0.4795,1.4415,4.6848,3.725,5.3553,3.8244,0.9604,0.4492,5.6035,4.5556,0.656,5.8473,4.0158,3.3431,0.1103,0.0022,4.9225,1.6603,3.6452,1.4152,0.0036,5.8558,2.1931,3.9243,3.9587,3.4351,4.0602,3.3653,2.8801,3.3889,3.6069,1.639,5.2586,0.9123,6.4616,2.9624,4.1142,3.9116,0.1759,5.2808,4.2718,2.036,0.0381,0.4383,1.8351,1.0099,0.3911,1.9356,1.5056,0.0173,2.2303,5.7901,2.8909,2.2707,5.2801,0.0147,5.87,6.0409,2.025,5.3334,4.0799,2.4175,0.2898,1.3857,2.7918,3.3335,1.1701,5.3878,0.6191,0.283,5.8198,3.0904,5.0512,2.1544,0.1204,1.3747,5.1865,1.8433,4.4107,1.962,5.0629,5.9827,2.4015,0.0143,3.1596,3.8732,2.8499,2.411,0.8235,4.6193,0.1852,2.6296,0.1993,2.5533,5.3169,3.771,1.5357,3.5273,3.054,5.9796,0.6885,5.8936,1.5108,1.2331,1.655,4.003,5.1853,4.867,1.6056,5.399,2.9009,1.5197,3.6687,1.1505,0.7837,1.7912,0.8801,0.7891,1.2419,2.9461,1.2542,0.5224,4.732,3.6683,0.3637,4.8086,3.872,1.1743,0.002,3.1852,0.3903,0.8834,0.3794,4.5521,5.783,5.2512,5.3981,1.941,2.5115,3.0266,6.2841,4.3103,2.3136,2.4319,2.1092,3.6261,2.594,1.462,5.0773,5.2668,2.2378,1.4986,0.1136,2.7882,5.551,1.8906,5.5467,1.7461,4.7859,2.3638,0.1424,3.154,2.0984,0.6336,0.7699,4.5665,1.4645,4.2441,0.7927,0.2195,3.3024,3.3807,0.0538,5.4654,4.6854,3.1786,1.0505,2.8096,1.1685,3.6249,3.0432,2.6762,1.5032,0.0324,0.0028,5.2793,5.7038,2.5884,0.6214,2.0389,4.338,3.9287,3.349,3.8815,1.096,0.0118,1.6814,4.4979,4.8225,2.5875,2.2252,2.9991,4.2547,4.7747,2.9964,4.2332,0.0137,1.521,2.5571,5.8604,1.7564,0.1216,5.1496,3.5097,0.0791,4.8991,3.5811,2.5057,0.2493,5.4973,0.2356,0.4724,1.2469,6.874,6.2171,0.4689,3.5746,2.7177,0.1805,3.3183,3.1771,0.1533,2.91,1.0996,2.0309,4.7211,0.2418,2.26,2.7412,4.4248,4.206,2.2181,0.7627,1.6196,1.1143,5.4539,2.2368,0.0763,3.867,3.5707,1.2768,0.0078,4.525,3.2811,0.9894,1.6649,2.2025,2.3917,6.2794,1.537,0.8925,0.3557,2.9828,1.7635,3.4874,1.6795,4.3223,2.842,2.1334,2.4226,1.4037,3.0475,1.4401,3.3683,2.8199,1.7325,4.924,2.6772,3.3571,1.5014,1.8531,1.8266,1.5682,4.4727,4.7395,3.346,1.0764,3.7841,2.6101,1.9738,0.9639,4.5309,6.0826,1.5972,1.7148,4.3578,0.2136,3.4412,0.0426,1.7224,5.2961,1.8946,5.0867,1.2125,1.6583,3.7331,5.2157,0.0152,3.9274,5.6932,1.8115,2.9448,2.9907,2.724,0.9912,4.013,6.0629,0.9987,0.0069,0.4159,5.179,0.0141,4.4557,1.8416,0.846,1.3158,1.8456,0.9969,0.0108,4.0137,0.0956,0.5217,1.7449,3.1407,0.0215,5.179,2.9625,5.1846,3.4299,1.3019,2.0689,4.9659,5.3532,4.8302,3.2477,3.0338,3.9859,2.0355,3.7037,0.4217,2.8236,2.2089,0.105,2.6206,2.8374,1.2731,0.0077,2.114,0.4081,4.3419,3.3108,5.6686,2.5712,1.782,4.2902,5.8094,5.7697,0.0008,0.8904,6.0802,5.6088,0.8146,4.8335,4.6744,5.7589,4.4748,1.6404,2.3091,3.5982,2.4913,2.1068,0.9168,2.8165,0.9659,2.1178,4.1767,2.1223,4.0985,5.1741,2.921,2.5923,2.182,0.09,2.2994,5.479,1.2888,6.0641,2.2542,0.6092,0.018,0.8522,3.2657,4.2084,4.8894,0.9702,6.6191,5.5538,3.1822,5.8182,0.8824,2.7348,5.0888,4.8888,2.0791,0.9044,3.0666,5.7879,4.4149,2.9963,1.1798,1.4046,4.2354,1.5152,4.1395,2.4637]}
{"id":823,"ended":false,"length":575,"gen_text":"Gordon was again arrested on 13 January 2004. Police said at the time that the murder file had never been closed, and that the arrest followed new leads. These new leads were not related to the case in the way that those leads were previously alleged.\n\nThe case is now under judicial investigation for possible violation of the Criminal Code.\n\nPolice in the United Kingdom said that they could not reveal what charges were pending against these three men during interviews with them after coming to the conclusion that the man had no criminal history at all. According to them, they were not aware of any previous cases or allegations against them that have been found to have been substantiated with DNA samples or the fingerprint evidence.\n\nIt would be interesting to see if the court would be able to find them guilty of any crime or sentence at all. As a result, the Court of Appeal has indicated that it is unlikely that any new charges will be laid.\n\nThe police were given no instructions about where they will go with the investigation of the case.\n\nWhat should be done?\n\nFirstly, the criminal justice system must take a more active role in bringing about change in this country. This will not only improve the quality of life for women, it will help ensure that our current system works for everyone living in the United Kingdom.\n\nSecondly, this system also will promote public awareness about the issues presented in these cases, especially as their potential impact will make the courts accountable and provide greater political impetus for further work.\n\nThirdly, we must do better. The public as a whole must know that justice is done, and this will require a better understanding of these issues. It is very clear that if we give up on these issues the public will be deprived of our rights, as they are already being denied due to the criminal justice systems of countries where women are being denied basic basic rights. We cannot let these issues go unchallenged.\n\nThe Criminal Code was amended in 2003 and has been amended several times. The current Criminal Record Act 1994 gives women the right to register as a sex offender, but any convictions will be carried out in the traditional way, with a person being convicted on an isolated charge.\n\nIt would be useful if the courts could make some changes to the Criminal Code to ensure that people with criminal records are not given a second chance. This would only further strengthen the criminal justice system.\n\nSecondly, a new Criminal Code. This is likely to be made to further improve the system by making it more consistent with British tradition with offences, such as \"beyond a reasonable doubt\", \"conspiracy to commit murder\", and by defining specific types of offences as that which would constitute a conviction of more than one offence at any one time.\n\nThirdly, the Government needs to set a date when the Criminal Code will be replaced by a Code of Practice making it more transparent to women\n\nFinally, there are more important things to do for women in the United Kingdom","token_len":605,"entropy":[4.7983,7.5165,4.3911,2.0027,7.6953,3.2393,4.6795,1.6549,4.6574,1.7904,5.0605,0.5704,0.0276,0.917,2.4027,6.3049,10.8269,1.4246,5.2606,0.1273,3.1392,2.3049,1.0995,1.0445,1.9406,4.9268,7.0103,7.2551,4.1434,0.818,7.1623,1.3088,0.1089,2.2508,2.5668,4.1095,0.0859,0.7033,2.0797,4.0987,2.4233,4.3143,0.766,4.9049,2.0164,1.1236,3.0624,3.8443,0.8259,0.8905,0.0047,2.0281,2.9123,3.3288,1.4958,2.7765,4.5779,2.7559,3.4927,1.8086,4.8536,0.009,1.0204,2.2425,0.3186,1.1598,1.0705,0.0004,4.7838,4.0126,2.0354,2.4769,1.3392,3.5681,1.4263,1.8451,4.0005,0.1255,4.5326,3.07,3.3087,1.548,2.6793,0.4324,5.4828,1.9537,0.7657,5.5908,3.8022,1.155,4.3333,4.0317,7.2539,0.6413,0.8655,0.7585,0.1388,1.8316,4.3928,1.4137,3.0101,1.8423,2.463,2.5383,0.1911,0.2379,5.9162,0.0016,3.6966,0.1308,1.6967,1.6812,2.398,1.8571,0.4744,0.4382,3.2015,3.5381,4.0437,4.3822,1.1928,0.8614,3.1313,3.5848,0.519,4.6873,1.0046,1.3409,0.9072,2.9376,0.0009,5.1025,2.2923,2.9089,2.8015,4.5153,5.0477,2.0542,0.6081,0.4334,0.0003,4.5251,4.4353,1.1085,2.0592,0.0316,0.9461,0.9463,1.3819,5.1313,1.9699,4.0535,1.002,0.0041,2.686,5.3908,0.3595,0.6039,3.0649,1.1402,2.8947,3.7639,3.4163,0.4224,0.6331,4.4582,2.9643,1.0006,0.3413,1.6689,5.6316,0.9703,0.0467,1.9779,4.3,0.3116,1.0631,1.6062,1.8897,0.4658,2.1828,4.0728,0.6153,0.5628,0.2155,1.5735,1.3039,0.6761,0.0003,2.0756,4.6768,3.7453,4.7712,2.9704,4.4197,2.6065,2.7576,1.312,4.7409,2.8681,2.5381,0.7304,1.9457,3.44,0.5635,1.1212,0.6569,1.2174,0.0003,4.4036,4.3792,1.7107,0.8517,1.2517,0.1811,0.0001,6.102,0.0761,1.3833,4.6872,1.7836,0.0589,1.9192,3.1147,1.9191,3.4393,1.1433,0.1433,0.1817,4.0718,2.5691,1.3387,0.8658,3.651,0.2459,0.4499,2.5598,3.1874,2.9346,0.9706,3.9002,0.582,1.5551,0.0516,0.2524,0.529,4.5149,1.0657,1.7472,0.1094,2.7671,2.4296,0.2742,3.6618,4.964,1.149,2.7235,1.7905,1.5475,6.7099,0.41,2.1061,2.4078,0.0082,0.222,0.5561,0.0002,0.8334,0.0088,3.9389,3.3016,4.9323,4.0669,4.7856,4.1059,1.972,2.0131,0.8517,2.1271,6.5359,2.0515,3.0756,0.675,1.9034,3.3358,3.2968,5.2386,4.4028,1.071,2.6782,5.2919,2.1672,4.3923,5.7539,2.3011,4.4141,2.86,5.2534,3.6732,0.806,4.28,5.1258,0.5847,0.346,0.0001,0.4981,0.0005,0.0191,2.3939,0.8139,4.2771,4.1296,2.1079,1.9894,4.0285,6.2824,0.0639,0.0123,1.6906,2.5965,1.049,4.0946,0.7681,2.4562,1.7728,0.6614,3.5595,2.3052,3.7716,1.82,3.5678,1.1487,0.114,3.4486,0.637,0.6382,3.0649,0.8001,4.2154,3.5353,0.3177,4.2085,1.1373,5.5903,2.5555,0.7813,1.8703,1.0733,4.9626,2.0818,0.5637,2.1807,3.8568,0.0462,4.4786,2.278,2.0371,3.482,2.0373,1.6932,3.2127,2.1526,0.9662,4.9472,0.1488,1.347,2.9901,0.5941,4.561,2.6498,4.2349,3.6161,1.6894,0.6456,3.4207,1.6006,2.0388,3.9174,0.3912,0.48,3.5712,2.858,2.7608,2.3159,2.174,2.0128,1.4246,0.0003,0.0001,0.689,0.3441,0.0002,2.3182,4.5756,0.4211,3.4196,1.7574,0.5803,3.3739,2.0834,2.1479,1.0026,1.3561,3.1156,0.0133,2.5906,1.6264,2.7843,2.9109,8.4007,0.7661,4.1059,3.3525,2.6016,0.7113,0.1349,0.0539,4.9641,1.0198,0.3793,0.7604,0.0309,1.8085,1.9812,5.6362,3.7695,3.318,1.2374,4.793,0.0401,2.1569,1.5475,5.2547,0.9765,1.9823,2.6167,1.342,3.4553,1.7778,2.6146,2.9796,2.9599,4.241,1.5707,1.5288,1.2141,0.0002,3.1672,3.6249,0.3303,4.0588,1.7062,1.1074,2.1147,0.9936,3.4123,3.4577,0.8782,0.449,0.7031,0.7411,0.3219,1.185,1.9306,0.2653,4.2296,2.8311,1.8258,0.5595,1.0915,1.1068,3.2342,1.9673,3.2048,0.0591,1.0787,2.181,0.8062,5.4422,4.1674,2.3083,0.6772,2.7112,0.0962,0.0146,1.7949,0.5561,0.0002,4.8839,0.0179,4.1646,2.5706,1.408,0.7936,6.9274,1.1695,1.556,5.3737,0.0269,0.9648,4.4906,3.0576,4.5981,1.682,0.3373,2.3027,3.2536,1.7551,0.4443,1.1441,4.7615,1.4937,5.0081,5.4711,5.6006,5.5968,3.8722,2.3545,0.0022,5.162,5.5017,0.9041,2.7517,0.0859,0.0186,1.57,2.179,4.3733,0.7256,0.5674,0.1403,2.4827,0.5745,0.7277,6.7808,5.668,4.3898,3.769,0.0149,0.7948,2.9469,5.5812,1.0052,2.555,3.396,0.9474,3.6818,2.984,5.6166,0.4937,0.7739,0.1703,4.0547,1.3225,0.9323,0.0512,0.1789,0.5814,0.0002,0.8736,0.0002,0.0161,1.5899,5.19,3.2754,0.0328,4.4569,2.3019,2.9665,2.7765,1.1306,1.1597,0.2622,0.502,0.2058,3.5989,0.8344,0.6831,5.5573,1.4074,0.8214,6.9124,1.1072,1.8108,4.339,2.6683,2.0962,7.6622,0.0002,2.4342,0.0185,2.7873,1.3494,4.7292,1.8913,1.5346,0.6161,0.6489,3.3859,0.5779,1.7069,1.3025,1.3169,0.0017]}
{"id":592,"ended":false,"length":523,"gen_text":"Because of the adverse effects of cadmium on the environment and human health, the supply and use of cadmium is restricted in Europe under the REACH Regulation. The EFSA Panel on Contaminants in Europe ( EFSC ), which is the main regulator of natural uranium fuel supplies to countries like Russia and other countries in the European Union, should assess if the risk for human health in the supply of radioactive materials is present but is less than those in the distribution chain due to environmental toxicity. In addition, the EFSA report is designed to provide a strong and authoritative warning to European government and environmental authorities that radioactive substances such as cadmium or lead have an adverse effect on the environment and human health. To this end, the EFSA panel recently sent out a letter to the EDFN, the European Commission, and CNRS reporting that the risk of long-term health effects can be reduced through direct and indirect mechanisms like irradiation.\n\nThis case can be considered as the first case showing the value of indirect mechanisms. As part of its research in the field, the EDFN has published its analysis of the effects of radioisotope radiation, based on results of the 2005 and 2009 NAAB-7 nuclear safety exams, on the radiation safety of nuclear energy from 2004 ( Table S1 ). The studies based on Fukushima reactor 5 were conducted in Japan: 5 studies (including 4 in the National Nuclear Safety Laboratory, Fukushima Daiichi, and 3 in the Ministry of Science and Technology ), 8 of which were performed on short-onset (0.3 mV) radionuclides, and 14 of which were performed on large-scale (2-fold) radiation-producing nuclear reactor fuel (Table S2 ). In response to repeated reports that the effects of radioactive materials were minimal in Fukushima Daiichi, 5 of the studies (8 in the National Nuclear Safety Laboratory, Fukushima Daiichi, and 7 in the Ministry of Science and Technology ) reported a low hazard to humans under those conditions, and 1 was found to be the case with radiation produced from the Fukushima Daiichi plant when it was irradiated.\n\nThe European Commission is currently developing a Framework for Action on the issue of radionuclides and related elements in the European Union ( FEIS ). In a final stage of this task, the Commission, in a recent letter to the US Department of State, called for action on several important things: 4) a stronger protection against contamination of supply of radiation from nuclear power plants; 5) a broader mandate to reduce radioactive materials disposal limits; and 6) regulation of non-radioactive wastes.\n\nFor information about the case, you can read the relevant public statements of the EDFN, including the NAAB-7 Nuclear Safety Examination for Fukushima Daiichi ( na-7.eu.pdf ), the 2002 NAAB-7 Nuclear Safety Examination for Tokyo, and the NAAB-7 NPP for Chernobyl.\n\nFurther References","token_len":605,"entropy":[2.828,1.2492,8.3238,1.2532,1.1888,9.9088,0.0345,0.0007,2.8333,1.6632,3.8822,1.964,1.957,0.0434,0.1555,1.7111,8.5458,3.1465,1.912,0.0225,1.5325,0.0035,0.0002,1.7679,3.7436,2.1184,4.2363,5.848,1.2408,10.3457,4.2822,7.4025,0.6462,1.9719,9.3692,0.9025,9.3244,2.6016,4.8086,0.3072,0.4575,2.7304,3.8398,1.4375,10.2829,3.4461,2.9319,1.2947,1.5065,2.9345,2.5309,2.6373,0.4015,5.7678,7.2642,6.0453,2.9002,3.0702,3.114,3.8558,2.1983,1.218,5.1608,1.3379,2.089,0.6676,2.1306,0.032,0.2055,5.9128,4.6059,4.1489,1.4049,3.9659,4.5977,1.8341,0.0502,3.9608,1.4373,1.3274,1.0782,3.2203,1.1888,1.0585,4.9206,5.5275,2.4309,4.1786,0.7224,4.2566,1.2017,0.3391,4.0892,2.9255,5.5927,0.0041,4.6466,5.7708,0.6043,3.1465,1.9605,0.2069,1.0058,2.4968,1.0302,6.6847,3.3921,4.7967,0.0817,2.3522,1.4821,5.2867,2.8011,4.9167,3.8618,1.5408,4.6096,5.1856,2.232,4.4939,0.887,2.6131,3.2956,2.7574,3.4278,0.0007,0.3338,0.0016,0.0001,3.7295,1.8632,3.7832,2.7757,0.4764,0.7617,0.0451,1.141,0.6557,0.8585,0.3961,0.0074,0.5369,5.3598,1.9852,0.0129,0.0936,0.5573,1.2112,0.4933,4.1358,5.7542,5.3136,2.1315,0.4592,2.5938,0.2671,1.4826,5.1744,1.6503,4.8227,1.9698,1.5772,1.3758,1.1526,0.7381,0.9751,5.8116,3.0616,5.9323,1.3683,1.4611,3.6012,0.6674,5.9568,0.106,0.0408,1.7311,0.855,5.2899,0.3078,1.7548,2.8875,5.084,2.5881,0.3774,5.1299,5.1599,6.0067,0.0509,1.4069,1.3154,0.0018,4.2748,5.148,5.8151,0.5197,2.5258,0.8198,1.7569,0.9722,1.6441,5.2425,1.4484,5.2564,0.094,5.7944,1.6644,2.3919,4.0996,3.933,0.0009,1.5161,3.978,3.2575,1.4459,1.8056,1.7913,0.5851,1.3902,0.0157,0.0081,1.824,4.424,3.3431,4.2186,0.3473,1.1131,2.1794,0.0571,4.866,1.3186,0.0063,0.7902,2.5057,2.9514,4.5524,0.0623,5.1092,1.3792,1.8684,5.3339,3.4441,2.9413,4.6138,3.9119,4.5594,3.1939,5.0938,4.4373,3.1559,4.9833,0.9591,0.8401,1.1939,4.4261,3.0804,0.3124,3.1895,3.0904,4.8176,5.6417,5.2859,5.5936,2.6591,0.7661,0.3507,1.1104,5.4793,5.7779,0.0378,5.5485,6.1034,4.4146,2.4241,1.6463,1.1034,2.3563,6.8712,5.4313,3.2676,2.8114,4.2464,3.6917,2.2422,1.1078,5.8953,2.2702,1.5054,3.3923,1.9945,1.9067,1.9221,0.012,1.5319,1.2601,2.9419,0.1007,0.2994,4.0587,0.01,3.4221,0.3509,0.0412,7.1073,5.3797,2.622,0.1248,0.8282,3.443,2.6129,5.611,0.1491,8.0036,0.3418,3.2925,3.8455,0.2329,2.6525,1.846,3.8607,0.4329,3.9298,0.2467,0.005,0.0414,1.6242,1.0813,4.2488,0.913,0.1154,0.3245,1.2406,0.5075,4.4074,0.54,0.5421,1.0747,3.1754,3.6093,3.4382,0.3466,2.9116,3.2768,4.332,4.2193,3.5205,5.1954,1.9664,2.0888,0.1244,0.6192,0.1331,2.4084,5.7725,0.0629,6.451,4.794,2.4686,1.6506,3.7105,0.1103,2.0492,1.2223,2.1434,3.7032,1.6611,1.6337,1.5846,0.0003,0.7963,5.8951,2.2287,0.3747,1.8098,1.8472,4.7244,0.5817,0.2402,0.2622,0.0918,0.0063,0.0176,0.2812,0.2318,0.0268,0.0001,0.523,0.0443,3.4979,0.0368,0.0044,0.0149,0.0008,0.1142,0.0018,0.0017,0.8361,2.2669,2.3002,4.299,2.9297,2.3883,1.6572,5.9642,5.6653,0.286,1.9801,1.3771,4.3033,3.9737,3.159,0.175,0.4313,3.9825,0.7961,2.683,3.7193,3.4551,1.1758,2.2512,1.2208,0.4815,0.0003,2.7441,5.3713,3.1586,0.4368,4.0368,0.0022,1.4993,2.2051,0.0002,1.4991,4.4525,0.3799,3.16,2.2454,4.1494,0.8154,4.9768,1.7963,3.1467,1.0189,1.4036,4.5973,0.2633,3.2662,0.1906,0.0011,0.1831,1.9374,3.7532,5.238,1.2117,1.3766,2.9049,0.2837,1.6029,5.0977,4.9391,1.9714,2.7475,3.6782,4.4281,5.7891,1.0337,1.7869,4.2796,0.1913,0.5702,1.3946,4.6724,1.6249,2.8359,4.1701,3.2532,0.4857,0.4324,5.2798,2.0283,0.0003,2.068,0.4044,3.6225,0.4876,3.9315,0.8662,5.9701,4.1358,5.208,1.4341,6.6601,2.4899,2.9842,5.582,5.5372,1.7156,3.2792,1.2638,6.3589,2.2515,4.673,1.6813,2.0117,0.7094,0.1997,1.3931,0.2017,0.0023,1.3741,5.9168,4.9115,1.2512,3.1786,3.4881,2.2957,5.913,6.0994,1.1657,0.4296,0.0256,0.0021,6.2824,0.2602,5.7909,0.244,1.6426,0.0148,4.0454,1.3514,1.0084,0.0002,4.647,4.2541,0.9763,0.5202,4.4216,1.0473,4.327,0.3112,2.1883,0.3932,3.8786,4.8512,3.0935,1.6721,0.2293,1.9525,0.0372,0.008,1.3699,4.2377,1.1951,5.1722,0.1478,0.0162,0.1097,0.0643,2.1336,0.0194,2.2924,4.8376,1.784,1.3666,0.0001,2.2048,9.8794,2.9077,3.7227,1.8995,3.2175,1.6086,4.5692,0.8545,1.0072,5.9917,1.2102,0.021,0.0273,0.0534,0.297,0.9776,0.0191,1.0244,0.6758,4.8727,1.8603,0.4444,0.2016,2.6116,0.0401,0.0804,0.0306,0.7787,4.0041,4.8155,4.3603,2.4832,0.0006,1.2372,0.6981,0.0001,5.2763,5.9193]}

{"id":424,"ended":true,"length":585,"gen_text":"The Republic of Ireland is a parliamentary democracy based on the British model, with a written constitution and a popularly elected president who has mostly ceremonial powers. The government is headed by a minority leader and has a parliamentary majority of just 51 seats, with the other 18 members elected in local elections with a mandate from parliament.The government is led by a minority leader in the House of Commons as well as a majority of the Parliament.\n\nMembership of the parliamentary assembly is based on voting average during a public election in each house each year, and membership is based on the House of Commons' voting average for that year, the Senate's voting average and the Senate's voting average.Members of parliament are elected on a case-by-case basis, but do not be held to account for their voting decisions or their opinions.\n\nAs a result, the Republic of Ireland has no representation in the senate or anywhere else in the European Union. The government enjoys complete immunity from scrutiny and is generally not subject to any of the political accountability that a constitutional republic has enjoyed.\n\nElections\n\nVoting takes place in seven rounds. Each round has a separate number of MPs. A vote for a new government takes place in five rounds based on the House of Commons' members' votes (represented by a majority of the Parliament), followed by a vote by the speaker for two rounds based on the House of Commons speakers' votes (representing the majority of the House of Commons and each member), and then a vote of no confidence (the vote of no confidence is that members are not elected to office). The votes of the Speaker and Speaker's respective groups are usually based on the majority of the number of seats in the House of Commons. The Speaker is elected by a majority of their respective group leaders, but is normally elected by his or her peers in their respective group societies or political parties.\n\nIn most European Union countries, the House of Commons has no representation at all; therefore, the government will automatically elect a Speaker during each election. There is one major exception with regards to parliamentary sovereignty, as it is usually represented by its members: in the United Kingdom, the House of Lords does not have a representative at all, even if it did vote for a major party (Britain last voted again in 2006, only a week ago), and in the Netherlands, a House has no representative at all. If a member is elected to his or her House of Lords House of Lords, their voting is largely voluntary, meaning no representative can be chosen at all.\n\nThe Senate's voting average for the 2011 EU referendum is about 4% for the House of Commons and about 5% for the Senate. When parliament returns from a foreign parliamentary election to vote again for a new government, the Senate has a chance to vote for a new parliament. (Members also have the right to express their opposition to the government's policies in negotiations with governments, if their party are represented by a majority of both Houses of Parliament).","token_len":605,"entropy":[9.7623,0.6631,1.6115,2.5198,1.9487,6.0898,1.6368,4.4198,0.1781,0.8293,5.7208,5.9002,1.9075,2.2743,1.6844,7.0352,0.0663,1.297,1.5797,5.685,6.5351,0.0522,2.8045,4.0304,2.2826,9.4976,6.088,1.2854,0.3412,1.6688,3.1681,1.6587,5.9675,0.0206,0.9875,4.568,2.5925,2.1628,2.3991,1.9939,2.7607,0.4961,0.4249,1.8946,4.3813,2.0973,1.936,2.165,1.6043,3.843,5.1596,3.6333,2.037,2.5296,3.5005,0.8654,5.3668,1.4827,4.4744,1.4199,2.3495,0.2443,5.2161,2.4762,1.5013,3.469,0.0145,1.0572,2.3366,0.848,4.4509,0.9559,2.0766,0.02,0.5846,5.3169,0.3653,0.0739,0.9057,1.1207,0.3853,1.5019,4.3305,2.3024,3.3091,0.0006,5.7855,2.5765,2.1844,0.4097,4.3292,2.8144,0.7644,2.6127,0.1063,4.0192,5.1534,6.4353,2.6501,5.8399,1.8734,3.1404,2.9386,4.7601,6.0845,0.1994,1.6445,1.553,4.8709,1.2798,1.5256,0.0434,1.2385,5.3432,0.5203,0.3906,2.0742,2.802,0.5869,2.587,3.5393,0.2686,2.8742,3.3736,4.3524,0.1087,0.9679,0.0068,2.1161,0.4913,4.62,0.1331,1.1909,0.0334,1.7202,4.8225,1.7041,1.4653,0.8766,0.7496,2.4132,0.6553,5.1177,0.2666,0.0003,0.0009,0.0002,0.0101,1.3529,3.665,4.343,0.0456,4.3936,3.9529,1.2824,1.7108,0.6104,1.004,2.0487,2.2978,3.4949,1.8358,4.9065,0.9168,1.1425,0.0002,4.5592,1.3762,0.5822,0.2759,1.5019,4.7244,0.3149,0.0015,1.8347,2.9256,3.1599,0.3654,0.9784,5.6189,1.5863,4.9887,0.3738,0.3994,0.3902,2.4318,0.019,0.4456,2.3765,2.7887,4.7036,4.6045,4.2582,0.1611,5.2479,2.5006,2.1246,5.0624,3.0618,0.3316,0.0037,2.417,3.6967,0.081,4.0758,5.3043,1.9917,4.2988,5.0706,2.221,2.3721,3.0054,1.1011,0.5779,0.0002,6.0228,0.1428,1.8596,0.0001,5.686,0.2709,3.8004,0.0014,1.2356,4.7832,3.7216,2.4662,1.4181,0.1088,2.4945,1.1069,5.0301,3.9342,0.4168,2.9615,2.2594,3.2621,2.3452,2.0178,0.9956,3.1479,1.3606,1.9013,0.3785,1.2258,3.5676,0.2241,6.0715,0.0324,0.5926,4.4066,0.165,0.1319,0.6401,6.1334,0.5583,1.7582,4.3366,5.9685,0.2881,1.6061,2.8858,0.447,1.1011,3.0018,2.5433,2.0829,0.0137,0.3153,0.7083,4.1689,0.865,5.4778,2.4488,5.5421,3.2823,2.12,0.0035,0.3628,1.769,0.204,0.1905,6.8305,0.1155,0.182,0.9339,1.8491,0.3078,2.0183,1.4229,0.1125,0.0987,2.0003,0.6274,0.0451,3.2758,4.7614,1.1793,3.8991,1.4081,1.2073,0.541,0.3108,5.1232,2.6238,0.075,2.4451,3.0143,2.9899,1.5857,0.227,0.0106,1.8794,5.9416,4.8439,2.6767,0.9684,3.8712,1.111,2.5196,0.9356,2.3336,4.2024,1.1775,1.7673,1.6929,1.4116,1.2639,0.7901,3.4193,5.4761,0.8853,4.4832,4.8518,0.0449,0.8832,3.3523,0.3349,0.3554,5.8484,0.0198,2.7965,0.9876,0.3834,0.5459,0.2212,0.0402,0.7427,2.235,1.2234,2.1425,1.0044,0.8629,0.7038,0.4996,0.3804,5.9183,3.1067,2.4132,5.9342,1.2456,2.6921,2.0199,4.6756,1.4919,0.7679,5.0031,0.2784,0.0022,2.0552,2.5011,3.0399,1.3873,2.7253,6.0031,3.4924,4.2625,0.1488,0.2185,0.733,0.0001,2.8174,3.2022,2.2478,1.376,1.0254,0.2227,1.202,2.4606,0.0208,0.3673,1.6823,2.2822,1.4073,2.1783,0.1728,5.0326,3.1968,0.2278,1.5264,2.4048,4.4354,6.0964,1.4252,1.2385,2.1948,5.3546,2.5247,2.4856,0.6439,4.6415,1.0129,4.5475,4.9541,0.6991,5.9144,3.5739,0.0019,2.4093,5.3965,1.4666,2.6021,2.7051,0.6025,4.3945,4.9431,0.2431,5.0417,1.6077,4.9466,1.7553,1.0397,1.6394,0.316,0.2976,0.8923,0.9941,0.0547,0.8261,3.543,0.0752,0.4364,0.8046,0.9456,1.5536,0.1782,1.6957,4.5642,1.5576,1.2204,5.6659,1.6126,0.7834,1.6109,5.2676,0.6313,2.888,5.3048,5.9339,1.4038,7.7549,0.8242,3.6605,2.1187,4.9001,3.8712,3.3045,4.7109,3.2636,0.8894,2.2846,1.1178,2.1947,0.7644,3.2118,3.1552,4.4755,1.1382,0.5076,0.5468,0.0049,0.7543,4.9808,1.224,1.6529,2.9512,0.7563,0.831,4.7742,0.1035,0.0015,3.0443,0.5176,0.3547,3.562,0.3409,0.397,1.3913,4.8205,3.6638,2.3573,5.1889,2.6463,1.127,2.7503,3.5305,4.0051,1.5724,0.753,3.5059,1.8189,0.7982,0.3736,0.6378,0.0001,1.7406,4.1328,3.1534,1.2756,0.1392,2.2466,1.5918,4.4996,5.3597,0.8755,0.6474,4.1222,4.0604,2.327,1.8465,0.6355,3.0328,0.0861,0.8797,1.2207,2.4352,2.3097,0.0352,0.0225,0.0399,0.2399,0.5358,5.682,4.6088,3.2142,1.6373,1.5096,4.8917,4.6667,0.8073,4.5082,3.4695,3.7785,2.1678,0.8355,0.6296,0.1023,0.3657,0.7441,1.6471,3.1773,1.197,4.9503,0.3689,2.8067,1.6303,0.9005,0.4071,4.2355,1.6599,5.1274,4.6281,5.0435,0.9544,1.0267,0.9066,0.0529,4.1924,0.253,3.9758,0.1884,1.9685,1.1172,1.4042,1.2538,2.6735,6.0037,1.2369,5.0565,1.9631,4.0861,3.5669,2.7122,5.9736,4.05,1.6063,0.6947,0.4333,0.175,4.2311,0.8593,0.5947,0.0749,2.1492]}

Nielsen also put the show on the Top ten in the United States for the first time in 1997. The episode became the first comedy-centric version of The Simpsons with two major credits: The Simpsons Season 1, and the first episode on TV for which Fox announced a new, multi-platinum deal with Universal Television for one year: \"Tired of a show that has no place in the American entertainment landscape? You won't be disappointed.\" In its fourth season, Lisa's parents, Lisa and Pauline, will reunite, and there's a new Simpsons episode, Bart's Big Surprise, directed by Adam Silver, about the relationship between Lisa and Homer Bartley. The show features Simpsons voice actors such as Gary Benson, Tom Hanks, Will Ferrell, and Jim Geraghty.\n\n, and the first episode on TV for which Fox announced a new, multi-platinum deal with Universal Television for one year:, and the first episode on television for which Fox announced a new, multi-platinum deal with Universal Television for one year:. Lisa, a woman with superhuman powers, has become an increasingly popular character on the Simpsons and has appeared at local and national conventions, as an outlander in \"Sicily's Favorite Neighborhood.\" Her favorite episode is on February 21, 2007 in the \"Wacky New Town\" episode featuring Lisa.\n\nSeason 5 [ edit ]\n\nMortgages is the eighth episode of Season 5. At first glance, Marge Simpson seems to be the first to take the lead out of Lisa. He's also one of the first Simpson characters, as seen when Lisa has a flashback of an event her parents told her, about how she felt when she first fell in love with Lisa at the age of 12 (after having her pregnant). The episode is about a girl who comes of age during a time of social upheaval around the world (as opposed to being in real life and living in her own hometown) that's changed her life and changed her relationship with Lisa -- even though her parents say they knew little about her. This episode is very similar to the original \"Sicily's Favorite Neighborhood\" episode, except that the girls start bonding when Lisa discovers that they've never bonded with any other woman before and have to learn to take a different form. As for Lisa's relationship with Bart, it also seems there's much more in common with the first few episodes of \"Simpsons\" than there is with the original \"Sicily's Favorite Neighborhood.\"","token_len":606,"entropy":[11.5847,4.3499,0.1978,10.7906,15.5777,2.1426,2.4136,5.0727,1.4563,2.2942,3.2361,3.5023,0.5615,4.4859,0.7352,4.2302,2.5706,5.622,1.6602,6.9522,1.7903,0.0277,3.0669,16.5838,5.529,9.8263,5.9643,3.152,4.4818,1.3174,5.1828,6.1189,3.3237,5.5369,1.1132,6.7315,2.4699,2.0766,1.4496,2.8292,0.8113,3.3814,1.4457,5.9064,2.5805,0.3242,6.6817,2.8181,4.6057,1.2476,2.1274,0.7439,0.9248,2.8829,7.1703,2.4851,1.53,2.6238,0.1312,1.737,1.1324,0.7281,0.1608,0.9948,3.4646,0.8709,2.8328,0.0063,8.5486,2.5731,0.1007,0.1313,0.0039,0.0433,0.0085,0.0013,0.0966,0.179,6.6688,0.033,0.0015,0.0138,0.0002,0.0008,0.0009,0.0007,0.0009,0.0003,0.0154,0.0002,0.0037,0.0006,0.0004,0.002,0.0053,0.0086,0.0003,0.0031,0.0019,0.0011,0.0025,0.0039,0.0031,0.0027,0.0159,0.0705,0.0016,0.0016,0.0117,0.0008,0.0021,0.0025,0.0024,0.0006,0.0043,0.0039,0.0005,1.5199,2.7504,4.2934,0.7306,1.2234,4.995,2.4425,3.5414,6.0173,0.134,2.6632,1.4336,5.1864,4.2895,5.1357,5.7535,2.0593,1.9645,1.9048,4.2147,1.2286,2.3565,1.7335,1.7164,2.9265,1.7207,4.1446,4.9598,3.77,3.751,5.3151,5.564,1.909,2.1827,3.8698,4.7128,0.1043,5.1945,0.0022,1.7246,0.9009,3.5928,1.2795,3.4968,5.0815,2.5546,4.4124,1.4207,4.5287,4.7586,0.4438,4.4654,3.793,0.7169,2.9571,2.3494,4.0243,0.3874,1.8565,2.6685,4.1612,1.9148,1.6699,3.3741,4.4397,0.0026,1.6918,1.0959,1.21,3.0663,3.9389,3.6467,0.5961,0.1837,6.1895,1.7606,5.0804,1.6639,2.3094,0.8134,4.8827,1.7005,0.3551,5.3292,3.5375,0.0004,3.9204,1.2946,5.2724,1.8153,1.2035,1.6352,3.1724,1.583,3.0949,6.0487,1.4572,4.4176,4.3682,0.8987,5.7676,0.0311,4.9532,5.5305,1.4972,3.327,1.7493,4.4618,0.2,0.8282,0.1913,2.62,7.2625,2.53,0.6827,1.8958,2.3781,4.7178,5.9466,5.3429,0.8808,4.5959,0.004,5.172,4.1405,0.4406,4.831,1.8018,0.0844,0.1311,5.0716,2.3447,0.0003,0.152,1.6819,4.8451,6.1456,0.0546,0.0003,0.8066,0.9001,0.0003,2.41,2.1375,0.0507,0.0158,0.0012,0.017,0.0199,0.0008,0.0001,0.0034,0.0004,0.001,0.0002,0.0005,0.001,0.0003,0.0004,0.0,0.0041,0.0082,0.0028,0.0055,0.0013,0.006,0.0021,10.872,0.0682,0.1416,0.0247,0.0008,0.0092,4.713,0.0013,0.0002,0.0042,0.0022,0.0024,0.0003,0.0005,0.0019,0.0003,0.0017,0.0,0.0022,0.0194,0.009,0.0052,0.0016,0.0074,0.0025,0.2294,4.3446,3.7366,3.9161,3.4202,4.7069,1.933,6.1728,1.5251,0.4292,2.7074,3.2135,2.6778,4.5621,1.3078,1.2491,1.5983,1.1194,2.4194,2.8329,1.7149,2.712,4.4889,4.8785,1.9276,0.0731,1.5828,1.6942,3.1593,4.9176,5.429,4.5503,1.8394,3.2149,4.1198,5.4135,2.165,1.9845,5.7727,4.111,1.9729,3.1223,4.5662,3.1519,1.4013,4.3549,4.4156,3.6883,0.2502,4.3463,3.1072,1.2551,3.5614,4.7707,2.705,5.7106,4.6197,0.3701,0.4054,6.1254,2.1366,1.7175,0.75,0.0003,5.4989,2.9627,4.4597,0.0002,0.0176,0.0365,0.0002,5.1754,3.4404,3.3239,0.0447,4.0851,1.8327,4.6107,0.2241,0.2132,1.57,0.1481,0.8105,6.3205,2.8812,2.1062,0.111,4.3028,0.9445,3.7896,3.2339,0.73,0.5273,2.2386,3.2474,2.2159,4.4465,1.6964,2.5626,7.0455,0.124,2.8509,1.8026,4.186,2.8052,3.8238,3.5858,0.0252,0.3451,1.9881,5.7953,2.572,3.2585,2.6596,3.5898,1.8906,2.5827,4.3223,1.5897,3.6015,2.1917,4.4026,4.113,5.6313,1.4373,3.5627,0.0932,3.7724,3.98,2.9517,1.6043,5.1714,2.0626,0.6634,2.5285,4.1447,0.6082,0.0143,0.2003,1.9313,4.3249,0.9745,1.3229,0.003,2.6647,3.8669,4.0232,3.0573,3.0065,5.5697,1.591,2.8525,1.1525,2.0805,3.7956,2.2972,3.6094,1.2996,4.4646,2.7603,0.007,2.6632,1.3236,0.985,1.3695,3.8949,1.1103,5.3874,0.9296,0.6256,3.1188,3.4431,2.4775,0.0017,2.9101,3.0848,6.1714,0.0989,3.5527,2.3343,0.9925,2.9452,1.8049,3.8618,1.9683,3.1486,4.2181,3.9636,0.8133,0.855,2.2171,2.9168,0.3991,3.5262,0.1674,1.526,6.9707,3.9504,1.0334,2.6883,0.8719,4.0035,2.3014,5.2139,5.2751,0.2766,0.6834,1.7528,3.9267,1.9434,1.389,4.617,1.6302,0.0565,0.8567,4.5279,2.4199,3.0663,0.0881,0.0034,0.0958,0.2247,0.0301,0.5056,0.256,0.9036,3.2284,0.8677,1.5661,3.5923,5.6422,6.288,3.6227,1.2315,4.9737,0.898,2.8346,2.509,3.7245,6.2734,2.007,3.7366,0.7994,3.6888,1.4977,2.6557,4.871,3.1466,3.1427,0.9196,4.6427,3.2284,2.7008,4.72,1.2208,4.3952,3.9267,2.1387,1.1586,1.7707,0.0603,2.9851,0.3817,2.0898,5.4638,2.2267,6.8968,0.7941,3.977,0.5464,3.3118,0.472,1.0485,0.9091,2.9507,5.6509,0.4292,1.2492,2.071,5.5231,0.0487,1.0896,0.3115,1.3508,0.4992,0.8729,0.6935,3.0197,1.5474,0.5143,0.0034,0.0016,0.289,0.0766,0.0083,0.557]}
{"id":844,"ended":true,"length":554,"gen_text":"Meyerbeer had no pupils and no direct'school '. Yet as his works spanned the golden age of grand opera, clear traces of his influence can be found in the grand operas of'The Stork in the Blue'.\n\n\nIt is interesting to note how his own daughter'was'married to a great dancer '.\n\n- A little further back, it is reported that he married another girl with'two'married to four'[by'his own wife']. This is probably an older version, based on accounts of early marriages, although that may give some idea.\n\nHe was also married to one member of the British army, with who he also married. The British army would probably have had relations with this type of woman with a relationship with him, which is very uncommon, because women often marry with a large number of men while they have no contact with her. It is probably possible that they have a married relationship during the time she is a woman, and hence they may have been there at the same time as the men, who have their own relationship during marriages. This might also have been true of the men in any number of other fields, such as doctors, lawyers and lawyers who had wives and children, or of those who have never had a woman.\n\nIn the latter case the relationship did occur: The first wife (the great one) became'married to a great soldier,'and so married him without any formal marriage - he is probably a true British soldier of that period (the two main sources are listed at the end of this section).\n\n(Source: Wikipedia) In many cases, it is not known what role the Great One played in the early period of British imperialism by taking part in war on the French, as noted above, but his engagement at the beginning of the 17th Century is likely to depend largely on his'relationship with the Great One'before the arrival of the English. He is often called'the'Great British Princess '.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia) He is said to have been raised'free from slavery, by good people, slaves and people living under the rule of their own government.'(Source: Wikipedia) He took part in many armed conflicts (which might make some sense).\n\nThis relationship, known as marriage, was obviously one with men. When he is in one place and the other is at another place, his wife then has the option of marrying to him. They then become friends, and the first marriage is not consummated until after marriage, so this is probably some kind of'kind of contract to be signed.'\n\n.'if one is found that there are two children of the same person to whom one is wedded, then the other two children shall be made orphans and to receive their parents from father and mother's orphanage, and hence also their parents in the family orphanage.

The current Team Name on the box (with a \"I\" next) is the team's name, followed by the number of appearances.

Unlike 'best league' these teams may not qualify for the World Cup\n\nThese teams will have different name (eg. Bayern Munich or Bayern Munich 2.0). The 'best 100' is considered the best of their best, for which they can be considered the best of their current league\n\nThis feature is used when matches are taking place at the World Cup (which isn't included in the 'football' category, meaning 'fixtures' are not counted) The 'best team' is chosen in the year by the player and can be used as if the player's name is the'manager' (but this doesn't mean that it's the best team) The player, in this case, must hold a high level of technical understanding to be included in the 'best 100' category\n\nThere are also two variations of 'best 100 teams.' The 'best 100' option is a very good one, for which all players can pass the 'C'\n\nHowever, in the case of UEFA Champions League, they are not used\n\nThe best 50 teams can be found only in the World Cup","token_len":606,"entropy":[9.7277,12.6299,2.5276,7.4633,7.2338,10.22,4.4058,6.9611,2.3664,4.4397,0.6782,2.3173,0.2567,0.6913,0.0975,1.441,0.2598,2.7767,0.0781,1.1368,0.2724,0.2916,0.0975,7.2595,0.7768,8.232,0.2849,2.2794,0.4252,8.7369,0.2295,5.167,6.0561,0.0371,3.1681,3.3201,0.1172,3.0435,0.4672,4.0042,0.0812,2.4708,0.1175,2.8809,0.0837,0.331,0.0921,3.4639,0.0818,0.308,0.1048,1.7589,0.0552,0.2384,3.9992,0.0066,5.1948,3.5534,4.9009,5.5338,2.9871,2.9309,4.7328,3.0435,0.0034,0.4275,5.1401,4.766,1.6626,1.9176,5.7777,3.7826,1.2109,0.0002,2.9019,5.7556,3.5778,4.202,0.11,2.8127,5.0486,1.4532,3.7307,1.2466,5.4818,1.7078,6.2641,5.9484,4.4019,0.3693,3.0382,5.8045,1.0992,4.456,3.7113,2.3966,6.0211,3.4443,5.094,4.7515,1.4846,1.1484,3.4097,3.3472,4.9672,0.0003,3.9983,5.9673,0.3261,0.4239,4.7277,0.0532,4.4359,3.805,1.2199,0.0381,3.2915,1.2448,0.0003,1.9766,0.4951,0.0762,0.2776,1.991,1.5426,0.0102,1.4125,7.4089,3.5797,4.2715,1.8609,5.3874,5.4505,0.4204,0.8454,3.8563,1.723,2.853,4.4607,5.5381,4.5709,5.1996,0.3655,5.4404,3.9281,4.2379,2.2336,4.4516,5.1468,0.4337,2.4786,5.2293,1.4279,1.8535,1.4176,1.5862,1.0574,2.5671,4.3221,0.0199,0.9001,2.6375,0.5319,4.9254,1.7826,4.2164,1.5792,1.6211,5.0945,4.8256,3.0552,4.5662,0.8245,1.1253,2.4061,0.4889,2.0497,2.7626,4.6326,6.0563,3.3821,1.8727,1.8528,0.0002,5.2155,4.5209,2.3736,0.2071,2.8599,4.6458,0.6807,1.7632,2.0578,3.5928,0.0347,1.8477,3.4449,4.1586,2.979,0.1192,1.5417,0.4532,3.3862,6.9916,1.0883,0.1879,2.8902,1.9538,0.0002,1.9783,1.2395,0.0477,0.2211,1.2271,1.4706,0.0074,1.1925,1.7811,0.0002,1.0993,0.113,0.0171,0.1033,0.3629,1.252,0.0053,5.0479,1.105,0.9221,0.9686,3.5344,5.1855,1.2366,5.0946,1.2745,0.5219,2.384,3.2965,0.9764,4.4094,0.0245,1.9237,0.5413,0.1507,0.0075,3.4542,1.2209,0.0002,5.3738,0.4404,4.7002,4.4596,0.3078,1.6138,1.2246,1.7077,5.3092,3.2074,2.7847,0.2084,4.6452,3.917,0.9827,1.0287,2.5077,0.2425,5.3205,0.6774,3.1151,5.4003,3.741,4.8139,5.1257,6.5878,5.4698,4.7677,3.2141,5.9127,1.812,0.0003,1.7076,1.3432,3.7245,0.4009,2.0212,0.1939,0.0026,0.0507,3.0597,6.0235,0.1334,0.4507,0.7864,3.037,4.8347,2.9494,0.6764,4.7933,2.0196,1.9895,2.8084,2.3987,3.1987,4.1738,2.8305,5.6092,3.9088,3.5526,5.0016,2.7316,4.7446,0.4598,5.3816,6.1907,1.4826,6.251,2.6264,2.3901,5.2012,3.1866,2.7424,5.0799,1.9071,4.5433,0.6761,2.9659,6.1413,2.1926,1.7991,2.1753,0.372,0.0002,2.9306,0.884,0.884,3.2669,3.4306,1.691,5.7912,0.599,3.5598,3.6676,5.2681,2.8062,6.0284,0.1238,2.882,1.8755,2.2884,0.0482,1.0709,4.1782,1.7244,0.0002,1.583,0.384,0.6717,0.9176,0.3353,5.946,0.0445,6.1728,1.9817,1.3928,2.0328,5.0592,1.1384,3.6265,5.0832,3.9638,3.2274,4.3139,2.7712,1.8361,6.0887,1.2748,0.0148,2.088,6.458,2.4249,1.0213,3.2003,0.6369,5.2083,0.8708,4.8215,1.2035,4.1199,0.3182,0.5079,2.4479,0.022,1.7476,0.0002,3.936,2.1187,2.9716,2.8619,3.6018,3.5687,3.2411,3.7826,1.5841,5.1391,0.2526,2.5379,2.3255,0.4868,2.0877,2.6725,0.2079,2.6978,2.0228,1.2284,0.3127,0.3624,0.0367,1.6305,4.6168,1.8459,1.241,2.3286,3.4943,4.8498,2.5244,4.879,4.645,1.4383,2.9811,1.3543,3.4908,1.4799,1.6106,1.7477,0.8382,3.1593,3.9546,1.8499,0.0002,2.1211,0.5402,0.6746,0.9292,1.0415,3.6098,0.3153,6.3958,0.0131,3.7262,1.4356,2.999,0.097,2.5877,5.0436,5.9901,0.0009,4.4576,0.2209,0.5116,0.9369,6.9596,0.6681,3.3857,2.2945,3.3917,4.7229,4.2426,1.8378,2.4179,1.5755,1.1338,2.4131,1.5788,5.0922,0.4192,0.2151,4.6282,0.2541,1.1316,4.0036,3.5354,1.4162,5.4481,4.4153,1.2201,2.9976,2.9681,4.0761,0.4549,1.3465,2.2007,5.4839,1.9454,1.2822,2.6053,1.7354,2.2453,1.4595,16.1987,5.0485,6.969,5.8983,2.1202,5.7168,2.7821,2.9089,0.0008,1.8138,1.2961,2.5665,1.2199,1.1681,2.0551,0.5481,1.8291,2.645,3.6626,5.3911,3.0514,2.6331,0.2326,0.7998,3.3638,5.9567,1.9191,5.2849,2.2637,0.1077,3.5018,5.2839,1.9337,1.5783,2.951,0.4448,0.3501,0.4599,1.3045,1.0761,0.3563,3.6841,0.8127,0.0003,4.0594,0.3966,2.275,2.5686,2.3612,0.337,2.7071,0.3262,1.2621,3.6142,4.3727,1.0664,0.4579,0.048,0.2647,0.5094,4.5958,0.8301,3.7315,4.1364,3.2355,1.7528,1.1014,2.4492,0.618,3.4601,1.868,1.9544,6.6687,1.4769,1.1673,5.3159,1.1012,3.0623,0.0003,5.5025,0.1988,2.9456,1.6058,1.482,0.15,4.0237,0.2845,0.0065,1.6236,4.4797,1.3881,1.5917,2.9409,2.3648,0.0003,1.6754,4.1439,4.84,0.9631,2.6524,0.5523,3.5197,3.6941,0.7297,0.8175,3.2211,0.0458]}
{"id":2752,"ended":true,"length":557,"gen_text":"Lowell's sudden death in 1916 temporarily halted the search for Planet X. Failing to find the planet, according to one friend, `` virtually killed him ``. Lowell's widow, however, died in 1917 in the same condition as Lowell's wife. The search was abandoned because of serious psychological challenges. Lowell did not survive until September 1918.\n- The first major manned mission landed on TerraMars on April 16, 1915.\nWith this mission, Lowell finally landed his first live target on the planet.\nHe went on to fly more than 30 missions over three lifetimes, most recently taking the famous Apollo 12 shuttle that landed on Earth. On the moon, Lowell had four lunar orbiters, including one that came on for only seven years. On our planet, Lowell's spacecraft will be his first one on Mars.\nWith this mission, Lowell finally landed his first live target on the planet.He went on to fly more than 30 missions over three lifetimes, most recently taking the famous Apollo 12 shuttle that landed on Earth. On the moon, Lowell had four lunar orbiters, including one that came on for only seven years. On our planet, Lowell's spacecraft will be his first one on Mars.\nThe first day of Lowell's orbit was a short one. From Earth, Lowell began to orbit the planet through the atmosphere and starboard, which will take him into the distance to orbit Mars.\nOn December 8, Lowell finally landed his first live target on the planet.\nLunar orbiters were used over the course of most of Lowell's two Apollo missions, and after three consecutive days of lunar orbit, one went out-of-flight.\u00a0 It was very difficult to get back to Earth without a lift-off, so Lowell made a final landing on April 19, but his time at the top of the first stage was very short.\nThis mission gave him a fresh pair of hands. \u00a0Both his hands were fully functional at that point, so the first set of hands was almost complete.\nTo ensure this, Lowell was carried to the moon about 25,000 feet above the Earth's surface, where Lowell used a drill, which was followed until the moon's rotation caused the lander to break apart and disintegrate. This stage of his life also enabled him to stay very long on Mars. He was found with a handful of rock fragments near the Martian surface by Dr. Allen H. O'Malley aboard the Apollo 20 moon lander.\nAfter many tests aboard the first lunar rover, Lowell decided to land with his body on Mars. On the following day, his left hand landed on the top of the Martian surface, where it took him on three passes back and forth for more than a full day.\nThe second day of a two-day orbit for human bodies, Lowell landed successfully on Mars.\nOn April 20, Lowell returned to Earth for \"the first Earth-Mars-orbiting mission to a Mars orbit for a new generation\".","token_len":606,"entropy":[9.0719,2.4695,8.829,2.4141,2.8976,9.3768,9.5266,3.554,0.8908,7.2372,0.3118,12.8024,1.4493,0.9967,6.6986,4.146,0.3467,1.2232,1.4087,2.484,0.9947,8.2256,0.0009,4.6481,7.1634,0.1934,10.6451,13.7898,5.3297,1.743,9.0516,2.5601,8.8894,1.4694,4.5704,1.0537,5.3046,0.0047,4.8119,1.0938,4.2558,3.915,2.5469,2.7156,3.1502,1.5666,1.7133,1.2312,2.6651,0.7044,2.3575,5.5606,1.975,4.0949,4.0279,0.9829,6.6581,5.3257,5.4154,0.9818,2.8243,5.3561,0.1699,2.9639,3.7134,5.2884,3.0995,1.0555,1.8219,9.7085,3.2269,4.1423,4.6675,5.3363,1.6902,5.9167,0.7221,6.406,6.6911,2.4441,2.9902,3.7449,0.0665,3.8612,0.4539,2.6574,7.79,3.8294,0.6821,0.5243,2.2077,4.3424,3.9622,4.0436,1.3145,5.8699,4.4514,1.413,1.0207,1.2239,0.693,2.713,4.2717,4.8782,0.9081,0.2315,3.4804,4.2099,0.0702,3.4943,1.5589,2.1309,3.7771,5.6235,0.0243,1.2358,3.8121,3.3409,4.5739,2.1321,5.7718,3.8799,3.1447,5.3716,5.0685,1.7679,0.4883,3.0239,1.7563,4.3561,2.6745,3.4454,0.2972,0.5408,3.8854,4.9389,3.8002,2.6857,0.2113,1.391,1.8909,2.071,1.7388,4.9697,2.8686,4.1729,3.0816,3.9102,2.6642,0.6386,2.6971,6.5837,1.5138,0.2534,1.6101,1.871,3.5764,4.4503,1.7186,4.8416,2.7412,5.2486,2.3259,1.1214,0.4476,0.739,5.1027,1.8734,0.6267,0.1782,0.3059,0.9933,0.0848,0.0113,0.0048,0.0041,0.0005,0.0119,0.005,0.0073,0.0166,3.4688,0.0283,0.0017,0.0009,0.0123,0.0014,0.0046,0.0223,0.0049,0.0014,0.0052,0.0004,0.0,0.0033,0.0038,0.0238,0.0016,0.0012,0.0134,0.0009,0.0085,0.0011,0.0015,0.0012,0.0013,0.0042,0.0007,0.3344,0.0793,0.0065,0.0005,0.0053,0.0242,0.0049,0.0078,0.0001,0.0014,0.0006,0.0012,0.0009,0.0007,0.0024,0.0012,0.0005,0.0004,0.0021,0.0006,0.0007,0.0983,0.0394,0.0018,0.0005,0.004,0.0453,0.0067,0.003,0.0019,0.0005,0.0076,0.0022,0.0033,0.002,0.001,2.2776,2.4726,2.3262,5.7552,0.5142,1.1589,0.0238,4.5035,2.0723,2.3266,5.0508,0.3771,0.9112,5.5073,3.7653,0.5229,1.0511,4.1233,1.0225,3.2828,0.9237,1.1329,5.6658,1.3359,2.8997,2.2316,5.4768,2.8045,2.1577,3.829,4.6022,3.0977,1.3586,4.8615,1.155,5.1752,2.6535,4.5701,2.0926,0.9242,2.0047,2.2155,4.0876,3.1048,0.1385,0.7273,4.1596,0.8892,0.4678,0.1463,0.1623,0.0132,0.1815,0.5633,0.3691,0.1385,0.9065,3.9401,0.579,0.0198,0.9858,0.464,2.5193,2.2154,6.2964,0.8667,1.5098,0.0007,5.5423,0.0796,0.2609,0.0008,6.0421,4.83,0.6262,1.5266,2.3508,4.7997,4.2983,4.3973,2.1417,0.8507,2.7903,0.9171,0.7864,5.2548,4.9318,2.8347,6.8602,0.7013,0.0024,3.1562,0.6378,5.5732,4.7994,0.8034,5.9569,1.4841,0.466,1.8249,3.7286,1.0196,0.4813,2.5106,1.8102,5.91,0.4765,0.0049,1.6441,1.3195,0.7084,4.1275,1.3702,3.9377,1.1842,1.0055,4.7044,3.0583,0.4832,5.2016,2.7417,6.0433,3.673,0.8811,3.0373,0.2755,0.4741,4.5093,2.594,1.1559,4.1767,0.3387,0.2281,0.7847,4.0121,2.2953,4.7486,1.7359,1.4518,5.7434,6.8807,0.0245,3.0073,1.2621,4.3901,0.0129,5.9736,2.6321,1.879,0.8386,5.2311,3.772,3.6015,2.3739,1.2974,0.7436,2.2262,2.6051,2.1697,5.0036,0.1929,0.5226,1.9377,4.5881,2.6283,0.4213,1.2897,5.2877,4.701,3.9465,1.5735,0.5586,3.5668,5.7694,2.0828,0.8056,2.757,5.4392,4.5826,1.8832,0.04,1.5279,0.468,0.4602,2.3621,0.9439,0.083,1.8375,1.0661,3.9759,4.2402,1.5278,5.6669,4.4079,2.8133,2.2932,5.1882,5.9514,1.6469,2.4064,2.9425,5.7014,5.386,1.1495,4.3486,0.0561,0.1468,3.781,1.7641,1.8752,3.5858,0.0036,0.3554,2.9283,5.6917,1.3588,2.0339,1.9663,5.9025,5.0697,0.2803,0.0214,4.2474,4.8404,2.8182,2.363,0.9556,0.9369,3.8616,1.8622,4.8019,3.7249,1.7427,5.8116,0.0093,5.3992,1.0408,4.1673,0.6249,4.2211,0.2832,4.0217,4.6455,0.0419,5.572,4.1575,0.4151,5.4908,0.453,2.9805,6.0976,0.6689,1.9777,4.9402,3.6475,1.146,0.0699,0.7951,0.8411,2.9651,5.3284,4.2679,4.4097,0.443,3.3479,1.6536,3.2891,0.4716,0.8731,4.1672,0.4007,4.2476,3.995,1.7369,4.8524,1.1241,1.4546,0.7903,3.3099,2.6421,4.492,0.3459,0.1499,3.206,4.5675,0.851,3.3656,0.5534,0.6477,4.5685,0.1561,0.4117,3.1737,0.817,1.1978,2.0757,0.8531,3.7081,1.7639,5.4275,4.1869,5.4365,5.4949,2.3433,0.0596,3.1265,3.366,0.0162,1.942,4.2748,1.75,0.4319,1.0377,2.5191,2.3277,1.4099,0.8589,4.9082,4.5903,0.2268,0.672,1.9819,4.0343,7.6546,3.656,2.8917,0.9194,1.8405,5.9819,0.7134,0.9293,0.8968,1.1179,1.5895,2.4166,2.1912,0.0741,0.6242,2.7983,0.289,0.1754,2.579,5.9856,2.7111,1.0345,6.8291,1.8984,1.6105,4.0119,4.7567,0.1976,0.7724,2.9898,3.8853,4.2011,1.5144,3.1782,2.5353,4.2484,3.2133,5.1753]}
{"id":191,"ended":false,"length":581,"gen_text":"Returning to London, Wheeler moved into the Hallam Street flat where his son and daughter @ - @ in @ - @ law were living. Wheeler and the latter disliked each other, but never married. His sister-in-law @ wrote a letter of apology to his brother in June 1982. In November 1984 Wheeler was elected to the city council. In 1986 he was elected as mayor of London but resigned on the recommendation of London mayor Peter Howes [see 'Peter Howes' ]. In early 1985 Wheeler was elected on the promise he would be fair to everyone and not give undue influence to his political opponents. When the year finished it was time for him to return to his wife of 40 years; he moved on to a new job with a business, with a partner. In August 2016 his wife is reporting to work on a new project, making a contribution of Rs 20,000 to her household. Mr Wheeler's former job was a member of the 'Granularity and the Grows up Club' - a group that organised a protest and the eviction.\n\nPolitical Prisoner of the Year 2009. A year after leaving public office for a quarter of a century Mr Andrew Wheeler wrote a tribute on Twitter. He had told journalists after the 2005 death that he was having dementia. A month before he died, he tweeted: \"It has been 5 years since Andrew's great success. He may well be dead... RIP to my children, my kids, my friends and my country. I hope my life's the same.\" In February this year Mr Wheeler was found dead as he had been fighting hepatitis C. He was 57. In December 2014, he won Labour's London mayoral election with an unexpected victory - he won by only 11. But it had become a campaign so dark - and toxic that Wheeler had been elected by his own party - that in the days before the election he gave a speech on the eve of the general election. The election saw him accused of \"shaming\" the city by promising to \"redact the election\". His opponents called it 'bullying' and 'political suicide'. On March 20, 2017 he left the party for a second, unimportant job writing a book about his political career. He died in Southwark, a city that did not allow journalists to enter the capital.\n\nThe Man of The Match 2004 The day after he had announced his retirement from politics, Dr Ian Wright gave his final report on the world's 20 most likely politicians to National. The job was described by Tony Blair as \"a brilliant and unshakable performance... he had some of the best people I ever interviewed.\" Mr Blair's successor Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Wheeler's comments on his job were \"an example of how to do our journalism.\" One of the more difficult to find sources for all of these reports was his wife who also served on the Council of Ministers, and he also was one of the chairmen for the Council of Economic Advisers before becoming the deputy director of the CBI","token_len":607,"entropy":[5.9258,2.0762,6.722,1.3479,10.3449,4.6106,3.5848,1.6016,8.7091,3.6307,3.2392,5.2833,2.2103,3.0964,4.1889,3.4179,2.0273,14.6354,9.8059,4.4053,7.4172,6.5246,3.4539,2.6257,9.5188,3.2334,1.5381,0.7148,3.297,3.7059,3.3202,7.0473,11.8264,2.4405,0.0302,1.8964,1.6778,4.7568,3.792,0.4839,3.7546,3.5361,3.8951,0.014,0.003,0.0022,2.7838,6.0017,1.4597,0.8437,2.056,2.5591,0.7575,2.9782,2.8256,3.4306,4.1125,4.4281,1.092,3.128,3.7493,2.8165,1.6013,1.9305,4.4961,1.3015,0.7918,4.4879,0.3375,1.3637,2.1607,3.7344,0.8376,1.3066,0.4843,2.7766,1.952,0.7792,2.2576,3.8674,2.0204,3.1706,1.9315,3.6153,0.0408,4.692,3.2266,5.2959,5.4125,3.1177,6.8859,3.3785,3.8949,4.2803,0.4447,0.0037,1.9018,4.9903,1.8299,5.0932,2.7171,1.5482,1.588,1.0006,4.6473,1.3357,5.7533,3.9067,0.0929,2.958,6.1799,0.8517,2.8161,2.1051,3.3348,4.9873,4.2914,0.9373,0.2317,3.1777,2.6042,0.8701,0.3136,4.8065,2.2885,5.7966,5.62,4.5904,0.3796,2.1869,0.6385,1.7798,0.0382,2.987,0.197,1.7453,4.3799,3.2827,3.4301,0.029,5.511,2.3231,4.0845,4.2613,0.4149,2.9084,1.0248,2.3469,2.3419,2.1506,4.2486,2.9532,4.7372,1.7375,3.9066,2.1148,1.9694,3.432,5.7939,3.6919,1.4236,5.2223,5.3581,1.2146,0.5905,2.9042,1.3698,1.2454,1.7746,2.6409,5.8576,2.1149,4.3198,1.1866,6.151,3.6668,0.8713,0.0426,0.9666,2.7891,5.6112,0.8104,6.0852,1.2967,2.4017,5.018,4.4836,1.8923,3.6021,5.0453,0.0361,0.4324,5.9483,4.9299,4.8478,4.9415,5.6494,2.2644,4.3131,5.3193,3.9152,6.2615,0.6226,3.5487,0.9886,1.639,2.7714,3.7981,3.4131,4.6316,3.9774,4.3339,5.6454,4.2469,2.377,0.1741,5.6608,5.6658,0.687,3.4253,1.9496,0.6202,5.1927,4.2249,3.5154,3.6578,0.5912,3.0563,5.1013,1.3533,4.2933,1.7213,5.648,0.6166,0.2428,0.065,4.1807,5.4535,1.404,5.9044,1.1357,6.0526,2.9135,1.7035,1.8289,1.8304,3.3275,5.6691,5.7664,5.0269,1.3082,5.3341,4.5948,2.5308,0.5443,1.3075,5.658,5.7524,1.1208,3.4969,3.515,1.9921,1.9708,0.5418,1.3143,1.2648,2.0366,1.0647,0.5618,3.9179,3.1402,0.4002,5.1462,0.3452,0.203,4.5519,2.6874,6.1144,5.0417,1.4373,2.2382,5.9556,2.2205,0.9506,2.4415,4.6041,2.91,2.5765,2.4647,3.3742,1.3966,1.7531,5.7291,0.7693,0.5428,2.3872,1.2962,0.9048,4.2468,1.2736,1.8693,2.6398,3.7263,3.6873,3.6746,5.3569,1.0033,2.0962,2.4403,3.6116,3.0737,0.022,2.6313,0.8361,1.4891,3.8959,1.4481,5.9909,0.5304,4.5175,0.7044,5.6543,6.4305,0.8499,1.1277,1.7227,1.3128,4.7558,0.5165,2.8191,3.6808,2.979,2.369,1.4093,4.9865,6.5159,0.4851,3.0568,1.0846,0.8473,3.1105,3.2175,5.0909,1.6728,3.5289,2.7269,1.4812,1.8162,3.4047,4.0531,1.1102,4.5332,3.12,3.73,3.8784,2.3959,2.9856,5.9369,4.9205,4.8612,2.4842,6.349,2.904,4.8241,1.6929,1.9546,4.5252,4.2504,3.7045,1.155,0.9015,2.2796,0.1802,4.6637,2.4543,2.7255,1.2592,1.1771,0.8589,1.0453,4.851,1.0111,1.0136,3.0542,1.3884,2.9837,0.0093,0.5323,1.3465,0.0196,1.3018,2.5432,4.2294,4.1498,2.1282,5.5052,0.1315,2.4896,4.6899,2.5069,0.9577,1.6783,3.2493,1.7303,4.762,0.7366,2.102,4.1776,4.2536,1.8429,5.0213,3.2296,3.3252,2.9399,2.849,1.4084,3.7564,5.7924,0.2777,0.9764,0.6024,1.8817,3.7178,2.1915,0.3947,3.9316,4.4513,3.2879,0.9826,3.895,1.7108,4.7435,1.2268,2.1083,2.7284,1.7608,1.5863,5.9662,5.1955,5.6574,2.3077,7.5291,1.1902,1.1829,1.4174,1.2501,3.8312,0.5121,0.3404,1.8479,3.5705,1.6118,5.34,1.3646,1.6397,3.857,2.6855,2.8232,5.5772,0.0639,4.2543,5.4327,0.5039,1.4512,1.8824,3.2279,0.836,1.1539,0.0005,3.4482,5.6701,3.2673,4.1551,5.0897,4.1825,5.3595,4.521,0.8774,2.244,3.4725,3.706,0.4752,1.2519,1.4641,0.368,0.6001,5.6619,4.9779,4.2244,4.0627,2.5472,2.2242,3.7612,1.1409,1.126,5.107,1.4518,6.2984,0.9347,5.7173,3.2718,2.7481,6.107,2.5613,1.9199,6.0684,1.2268,4.7597,1.5202,5.7313,0.3518,0.23,0.8941,2.3046,4.0011,2.2412,5.5355,3.307,0.1139,4.1718,4.5168,3.4481,3.0232,5.8599,1.449,0.0495,1.6126,4.3241,1.2732,2.7943,3.9512,2.441,3.1077,2.4533,2.6576,1.8641,5.9412,0.1036,3.1169,2.7749,0.6307,1.5365,4.7171,4.0534,3.1559,5.1164,1.2136,0.3355,3.436,3.902,0.1125,2.1225,3.5823,3.3834,4.9281,6.3984,3.3451,5.0122,0.6688,0.7269,3.9025,4.7377,5.1706,2.6237,4.9433,1.1116,5.4421,1.1762,2.6528,2.3835,0.7997,4.2195,3.1624,3.982,4.4522,3.9687,1.7921,0.4373,5.277,0.5427,2.7918,2.7559,2.4349,3.67,4.1234,3.9151,3.6995,0.0141,0.452,5.3214,0.4093,3.9515,0.5794,4.5078,0.4148,3.4221,0.1499,0.0924,5.1208,2.2472,2.211,4.1797,3.4364,0.5411,0.6417,3.3311]}
{"id":3791,"ended":false,"length":558,"gen_text":"Sifton was selected Premier in an effort to restore party unity, and his first cabinet reflected that. There were three ministers in addition to Sifton. Charles R. Mitchell had been, like Sifton, appointed in the year 1965 as Minister of Health. The year 1967 had begun in response to the assassination of President Harrison, although Sifton's nomination in the next election would have taken much longer. In 1967, Sifton began his senior government career before his first and thus the strongest example of an MP, and the first minister to be elected to a premiership since William M. Carter in 1928. The Liberal Party had spent most of the period in opposition before the war. Sifton had never been a minister at all since 1968. In 1968, Sifton's new Prime Minister's Office was formed, with the minister replacing former prime minister William Mulholland, who was retiring. The Liberals received a large amount of support during the 1970s and 1980s, and were instrumental in achieving several of Sifton's achievements. By 1983, Sifton's reputation for being successful... good enough to hold down a Commons position in 1994. In 1985, Sifton became the Minister of Education and had the most effective performance of any minister at the next Cabinet (he was named to serve for three consecutive terms). The Liberal Party (led by Michael Keenan ) then moved into the next government. Sifton was the first Minister to become Minister of Culture and the second minister of Education at the end of 1989. Sifton then entered Downing Street to become Prime Minister. He was also the last Liberal Liberal-Conservative minister to sit in Parliament for four consecutive terms, after he entered it as Deputy Prime Minister. He was also the Deputy Prime Minister in charge of defence and foreign affairs. One of the most prominent figures in Sifton's cabinet, and a key advisor to many of the government's policies, was his wife, Louise Sifton. ( Louise Sifton was introduced as MP for Liverpool and England, and became Deputy Chief of Staff, before leaving the Liberal Party in August 1993.) In her role as Liberal Minister, Minister Sifton has been a highly successful politician, and many of her policy choices have seen her in government. In the past, politicians have been asked to support one another, with Sifton in one notable instance. Her husband had already run the Liberals for a House of Commons majority after Margaret Thatcher. They ended up with both sitting in Parliament respectively. Margaret Thatcher was elected Prime Minister who, although he was not an MP, remained a Liberal in government despite her leadership of the Nationalist Party. Her first cabinet minister was also a Liberal prime minister, while the Liberals were still in office. In the end, this left only one Liberal Member to hold office ( Ruth E. Dingle ), a junior MP who was also an independent in government\n\n, a senior aide to Sifton, and a new Minister to Parliament","token_len":607,"entropy":[8.0003,4.747,4.0896,6.1637,13.0072,4.8604,5.8816,3.1546,0.0206,6.605,8.6416,0.691,2.5832,2.2093,3.6425,5.2497,5.5301,12.9753,0.9141,1.5882,5.3332,1.4543,3.8308,3.1713,2.4208,7.2787,0.0579,5.2527,0.1839,0.0002,2.3176,8.5287,5.8975,2.7672,6.8451,4.4099,0.9397,7.427,4.5004,1.2053,0.0041,0.0009,0.1331,3.0204,3.5306,1.8528,4.4727,5.3577,1.8474,3.7932,0.5253,3.3884,1.1218,2.5128,5.5483,4.1128,2.8445,4.9154,3.3642,6.2385,0.0038,0.7169,4.2488,0.0945,3.1387,5.2787,1.8144,5.5532,2.1578,0.0103,0.0009,2.3076,4.7491,3.722,1.4172,4.8833,2.8055,2.7099,0.6453,3.7993,3.8053,0.4392,0.7278,2.6192,2.9972,0.8115,1.7444,0.0052,0.0014,4.8646,1.7847,5.8775,3.6485,2.4449,6.4374,3.3288,4.0078,5.7108,6.8726,2.7529,5.8661,5.8753,0.1925,3.3756,3.6312,3.6014,2.564,2.8136,1.5763,2.5135,1.3179,1.8964,1.7262,1.5397,1.8273,4.244,0.0056,4.3123,4.4648,5.0288,0.4514,5.5167,0.8597,4.0559,0.4537,2.6934,3.9016,0.6522,1.667,5.6451,2.6555,0.0123,0.7318,4.4619,1.6825,1.8087,3.0094,1.7215,4.6344,1.7502,2.11,0.0115,0.0018,1.9122,4.3022,1.1071,1.5124,3.9007,4.1442,1.2569,5.0647,5.4137,1.0746,2.3814,2.7316,0.4033,1.8711,0.007,0.0024,2.8477,5.1289,4.8956,0.0089,3.2204,1.5354,0.8747,2.0358,1.4019,2.6018,1.5274,5.4794,5.8307,4.1552,3.4631,0.0242,3.5849,5.9042,0.6012,0.0008,0.0002,1.7391,1.0152,1.6432,5.2367,1.4413,1.7535,2.6851,5.1669,1.676,4.0336,2.1944,0.0022,1.0145,2.7938,0.621,3.7295,0.3849,1.6661,0.5288,0.0002,1.0118,1.552,2.8045,5.3145,0.0479,5.6528,4.8391,1.8635,1.9277,0.0083,0.0024,0.0011,4.0584,0.8469,4.3962,4.2097,0.1991,1.0802,0.0054,0.0021,2.209,4.1402,2.4592,2.2638,5.72,11.3226,9.0199,3.2413,0.7555,3.885,5.2466,1.266,5.5661,4.4968,2.1442,5.9205,1.7064,2.2295,3.6417,0.2688,1.216,0.007,0.0031,1.9617,1.1602,3.0501,0.4252,3.423,2.2381,3.4479,2.5374,3.696,4.1436,5.2938,0.9427,0.4329,1.4984,2.8386,0.7824,5.5599,4.9902,4.6607,3.4806,1.0628,3.21,2.7259,5.6846,2.3345,2.4398,2.1653,0.4814,0.8767,2.6535,1.9935,0.3074,5.7956,5.1673,0.0438,4.9851,3.1782,0.1065,5.8566,4.7928,3.8969,2.2121,1.5553,3.5479,1.9064,1.4464,1.8293,0.0158,0.0043,1.5847,2.7876,1.1685,2.6661,1.0705,3.1508,3.0527,0.2281,4.4338,1.0714,2.2186,2.0458,1.7609,3.1316,3.7845,4.6369,0.3439,2.4855,0.0024,4.7878,0.4268,2.5485,0.0233,0.0047,5.4141,4.9982,5.3605,0.0177,2.4941,2.1511,2.5537,0.0011,1.5757,2.0022,1.1356,2.7352,0.9412,4.1034,2.567,5.2963,5.7918,1.8109,2.4213,0.3799,4.5217,1.1396,1.5285,1.9561,3.8137,1.2649,0.2313,1.8283,3.4729,3.823,5.1532,3.6223,2.731,4.1395,0.3191,0.0016,1.3802,2.4487,1.0289,1.7819,0.5982,6.4226,0.2501,0.0025,2.5021,3.1345,0.0603,5.6335,1.8416,1.7394,0.2419,1.3378,6.0939,0.3384,0.6572,1.6308,3.3492,3.7833,0.6364,3.8065,0.0144,0.0033,0.0229,2.1905,1.84,3.5699,2.1924,2.648,4.3469,0.5825,3.3177,0.472,0.8419,2.8493,0.0715,1.7457,0.5032,0.2982,3.3963,3.0532,0.5679,4.3839,2.2835,0.0995,0.0023,0.6783,5.0922,5.529,0.6795,0.0225,0.0052,1.2515,6.1568,1.0859,3.1708,0.8575,5.7256,2.4075,6.0112,2.3693,1.7439,3.475,4.0968,4.8147,1.1529,0.399,2.6426,3.8608,2.6561,1.5003,1.726,0.1877,1.4721,5.3053,3.2695,0.9491,2.3247,3.504,2.2457,0.2031,5.1427,3.178,1.3721,5.8966,0.9886,0.0055,0.0018,3.8569,1.6292,1.9296,4.645,3.3026,2.4318,1.2015,1.7147,4.8741,1.3292,0.7305,4.3997,4.6282,0.646,5.8906,0.7608,2.8001,1.9858,0.6079,2.2622,2.2496,3.2247,1.0077,5.8735,1.045,1.6743,4.2838,0.4845,4.1837,4.8694,1.9393,1.3929,4.0959,1.6224,0.0083,0.0044,3.8428,5.0902,5.6257,1.2558,1.5121,4.0532,2.878,3.8089,4.697,5.2716,2.331,3.2186,1.7493,2.2657,4.4112,0.7149,0.1752,2.5845,3.643,4.5376,0.0315,3.371,4.9516,5.8096,0.1071,1.1555,5.7468,6.4363,0.9516,2.1011,5.5059,0.9779,4.4173,0.0565,1.312,2.8325,1.1526,0.0012,7.2941,3.342,4.0526,3.521,1.2027,1.9925,3.3086,0.0774,0.5017,5.3412,1.3804,1.4229,3.4523,4.0819,5.312,2.1046,5.1531,0.898,0.125,3.7227,3.6768,0.4203,0.6017,3.3451,3.2101,2.4676,2.3457,0.9786,3.9085,0.9839,0.391,6.9744,0.0034,1.1978,4.4324,2.4452,3.4081,1.8513,3.4479,0.9916,3.3408,0.9502,1.9551,1.9193,4.5994,0.1149,4.7062,4.0964,3.55,1.5092,0.606,5.9803,3.6615,2.5627,3.6194,3.9622,7.8521,5.8702,1.4801,3.9346,3.5387,2.4452,3.1093,5.2783,2.2806,1.9267,1.3038,2.6036,2.7062,5.7303,3.2164,2.8423,8.1339,0.1,4.4341,0.2785,3.7845,8.4419,0.1772,2.2547,0.0073,0.0034,1.2684,0.851,1.1235,5.6808,3.1889,2.8739,4.5636]}
{"id":4061,"ended":true,"length":583,"gen_text":"In Belfast in early November 1880, The Boycott Relief Fund was established to arrange an armed expedition to Lough Mask. Plans soon gained momentum, and within days, the fund had received more than $1,000 for the expenses of its first expedition. The fund was initially divided between the National Council for Social Welfare Relief, and those designated to carry out the programme. The latter two councils, the People's Council for Welfare Relief, and the Department for Social Welfare and Community Development, held the majority.\n\nThe National Council organized what might have been a successful boycott of the Government, but its leader, Professor Thomas Huggins, was forced to resign after the boycott led to his appointment as Secretary of State for Social Welfare for the first time in over half a century. A few days later, he withdrew amid rumours of an assassination attempt on the former head of the People's Council and the resignation was announced. The action was met by a massive response from the Government, who, led by Lord Macdonald, ordered that there should be a protest march by 1,500 people from all quarters during the occupation period.\n\nThe occupation of the hills in the West End and of the Highlands further escalated the struggle for social justice by establishing a Police Protection Area for the People. Police were responsible for establishing a Police Security Zone, one of the most prominent of which was the Police Stands. In January 1889, these areas had already been used to protect the First Presbyterian Church by police. This area was intended to protect Christian and other religious families in the region. They could provide the necessary protection to the people who were trying to defend their homes and property.\n\nIn April 1889, under the leadership of Sir Roger Williams, the Police Protection Area was granted the right to continue, and in June 89, the First Presbyterian Church at St Clement's, Dublin, was proclaimed a national church in Ireland, and that of March the first Presbyterian Church in Ireland was crowned as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\n\nIn May 1889, the First Presbyterian Church was taken over by the Catholic Church, after having been abandoned by their predecessor, the Holy Most Reverend William Bishop. The restoration of their own Church was officially instituted at Great Hall on May 25, 1894 and became the first major Christian denomination in Ireland. In 1916 the First Presbyterian Church was declared a Catholic denomination by the British Government.\n\nFollowing several events, the Rev. William Bishop moved his mission, on the occasion of Easter, to New York and became a resident of the first Presbyterian Church at New Rochelle. On his arrival in New York, some of his family lived in the City itself, and the Church then housed the first Baptist congregation in that City after the establishment of the first Baptist Church (1885). One of the largest congregations in the City for Easter Sunday services was the First Presbyterian Church at the State House of God on the Capitol Hill, New York (originally used by Archbishop of New York John O. McKay to accommodate Methodist churches).","token_len":607,"entropy":[11.5215,3.5753,5.9129,2.931,10.4204,0.5016,6.0504,6.993,4.5955,12.9169,4.0167,1.3375,1.3115,1.3383,9.4961,4.9987,6.6257,6.3241,0.8037,7.4327,2.3607,14.4561,3.0795,7.889,6.0074,5.561,1.1523,1.8152,0.8578,5.5068,3.1818,2.0156,1.514,4.821,1.6076,3.5847,2.2248,0.0142,1.4416,2.1601,0.885,0.5343,3.4784,1.5332,3.8769,0.4689,2.0836,3.2132,1.4106,0.5316,1.6788,3.2164,1.2008,5.2504,4.8614,1.5106,1.3079,4.9285,3.9287,2.4865,3.9028,2.6376,6.8037,1.2077,2.1231,5.8831,5.7178,1.7047,2.7438,0.1907,0.8361,5.2093,1.3169,1.3,3.5353,5.2597,3.1598,2.2053,2.4707,5.3529,0.0341,1.5671,1.0866,3.9192,0.8224,1.1566,0.4963,0.1882,4.9531,1.5852,1.3138,0.4705,2.2934,3.5299,0.7431,0.6355,4.6753,1.7722,3.1203,2.7265,2.102,0.0029,1.2305,3.2887,0.1357,6.6717,6.1008,4.8616,1.253,0.0316,0.9147,3.1783,4.5595,0.8032,1.0891,4.9494,2.2634,1.0452,3.2433,5.9466,0.4657,5.0993,4.5632,4.0814,5.193,0.0361,0.1316,1.2635,4.3628,0.1988,0.7723,2.3228,1.9532,2.8677,4.6664,0.1695,1.8175,4.7048,0.448,3.1768,0.4448,0.6671,0.6919,1.6635,0.2836,4.6176,0.8549,2.37,0.029,0.5795,3.7584,3.1424,0.038,0.022,0.0897,3.8992,3.4866,1.5042,0.7882,0.3255,3.3168,5.3662,7.3663,3.6196,0.8607,2.4751,2.8122,0.2387,1.5556,1.7429,5.7706,3.3599,0.0378,0.2743,3.8446,0.0076,0.2685,2.8729,1.7786,5.0248,3.0558,1.6172,0.7451,2.0594,6.0205,1.0671,3.0487,1.9257,1.3388,3.8942,3.7465,0.7852,0.6497,2.4284,0.888,2.058,3.3448,5.2631,0.0431,2.5473,3.9582,1.7537,0.1784,3.4397,2.4624,5.1993,1.4039,0.1181,2.5464,5.188,1.391,3.6257,3.9488,0.5285,1.6606,0.7284,2.5556,2.5899,3.2873,5.3441,0.2099,4.6309,4.4676,0.4539,1.1046,0.0002,1.4092,4.3557,1.19,1.9965,5.8794,2.8302,1.5853,4.5077,3.4491,3.5748,3.5511,0.8651,4.752,5.1697,5.0921,0.443,3.7449,1.1946,1.5794,2.1341,4.317,4.3774,1.2309,5.954,5.0991,4.1936,3.1744,0.8714,4.4129,2.4453,4.2671,2.1294,5.2835,0.0224,6.0484,1.6298,3.7817,4.4137,3.2489,1.8388,5.4389,0.6677,0.275,1.1935,4.5716,1.7897,0.3037,0.2851,0.8979,2.9486,5.2832,3.4847,1.5451,2.9956,3.7789,2.7879,0.2731,5.4591,3.4245,3.524,3.4359,0.3287,3.7353,1.5485,2.2696,1.3317,6.0251,4.394,0.0864,4.0896,4.4007,2.7258,3.8015,1.821,0.9735,4.1334,0.1428,1.4571,5.7157,2.6253,2.4054,1.7817,6.1744,2.7581,0.7065,4.3064,1.3667,5.8207,4.289,4.8329,3.6765,2.1147,1.4049,1.5927,1.712,2.7485,2.514,1.2112,4.7302,0.0232,3.4423,0.974,0.9713,1.2146,1.9774,0.7624,1.0384,0.0002,2.0822,2.7753,1.2471,0.1912,5.7055,0.6788,1.8423,0.0041,2.4287,5.1579,4.4971,0.1817,1.0026,2.0091,0.9213,0.1379,0.3227,5.3996,2.2656,3.4062,0.146,5.2438,3.5936,1.7793,2.6201,2.4853,5.6258,0.7258,1.2216,2.9131,0.364,0.0687,4.9154,3.3051,6.0348,0.3719,2.4911,3.9377,0.4601,0.912,5.1091,1.0714,2.8651,1.7675,3.0005,1.2758,2.8317,1.3629,5.0499,2.1284,6.4692,2.333,2.851,4.0245,0.7862,1.1624,0.6251,0.4611,5.9543,2.7421,1.4813,4.6849,1.3075,0.2176,2.7491,1.7384,0.2392,0.9727,0.0002,1.6378,2.2241,1.3869,0.2013,0.9985,1.9803,0.156,0.0392,2.1011,5.3498,0.3559,0.1777,0.4294,3.2224,0.5497,1.155,4.7893,4.0191,0.5283,5.1744,0.6463,3.4478,3.9603,1.0247,0.2898,5.9204,7.1877,3.1161,3.4292,5.6405,1.1171,1.2218,5.4649,0.2421,4.4365,4.7796,2.1748,1.5029,5.2338,5.5542,3.4462,6.6216,1.5765,2.0688,2.8195,3.217,0.212,2.668,2.1013,3.8136,5.123,1.1256,1.6913,4.2942,4.6006,3.5466,0.7946,0.5803,0.4398,2.6244,4.8183,1.7395,0.919,0.1686,0.0563,1.4764,3.1738,0.8172,3.5449,2.0925,2.5043,0.4046,3.3454,1.433,0.8682,0.6757,0.0002,4.4123,6.536,4.6879,1.3514,0.6632,6.1371,0.4357,2.3766,1.7643,4.6768,2.495,4.9856,4.4022,5.2269,0.9612,3.4711,0.0271,3.6377,0.5412,0.3183,4.1699,1.1132,2.7434,3.5615,1.7048,4.8964,0.2956,0.9674,5.1679,0.4278,0.1876,2.6496,2.3558,4.0477,0.0016,1.0611,3.6886,2.7847,1.8772,1.1894,0.3417,0.2337,0.6155,6.9241,1.3167,1.0722,4.0889,4.4019,0.5387,0.7886,5.2146,6.3665,0.8867,1.0699,2.7159,3.6225,5.3178,4.0267,1.9035,2.5029,3.9597,1.7836,0.8995,4.9613,3.8669,5.6945,1.281,3.2993,0.0184,0.4006,2.5234,1.9861,1.0262,5.8044,1.7847,3.128,0.4643,5.7311,0.3323,0.5019,4.7889,2.6916,0.0113,0.5823,0.8353,0.6862,5.526,5.4656,3.7231,1.3986,0.5734,0.6334,1.3315,0.1602,0.1061,1.1907,2.7646,4.7695,1.9424,2.6403,4.9417,3.4076,1.705,5.6641,0.4725,1.7491,2.7863,0.5459,3.8267,6.2464,0.0112,5.7892,1.9359,6.3466,3.6778,0.8269,0.1239,2.3412,4.7428,1.5565,4.9974,2.5478,4.4148,4.8104,2.9897,1.2109]}
{"id":4158,"ended":false,"length":416,"gen_text":"Immediately after the Fiesta Bowl bypassed Virginia Tech in favor of lower @ - @ ranked Notre Dame, protests from Tech fans and opponents of the BCS system erupted. Some said the selection of 'Clemson' in the top five was to highlight the need for BCS reform because of 'outstanding academic' ties. Others added that the selection 'was to further the cause of a program that could not hold on to those same schools even if it was necessary.'\n\nThe game is the most important public holiday in the year-long CAA Football Festival, and that's just one reason why the Fiesta Bowl's focus on winning football games should inspire so much emotion.\n\nIn the following video I will explain how Fiesta Bowl ticket sales are directly influencing our football programs\u2014and how this impacts our ability to meet our school's needs and provide the players with the education they need to succeed.\n\nThe video was also an easy read for those who had the time, energy and resources to find out how it impacts our football programs. I created an interactive map to visualize Fiesta Bowl fans' interactions with the game.\n\nFiesta Bowl Ticket Sales in the 2015-16 Season Season Fiesta Bowl Week Ticket sales % of Fiesta Bowl ticket

{"id":1159,"ended":false,"length":519,"gen_text":"Habitats in Boise National Forest support nearly 300 terrestrial vertebrate species and 28 fish species. The most common large animals are mule deer and elk, but other mammals present include moose, black bears and grizzly bear. Among invertebrate groupings (primarily mountain lions ), redhead bobcats, albatrosses, and large walrus, the majority are found in the eastern part of America but other regions have also been found within the western United States.\n\nThe National Research Council (NRCC) in conjunction with the National Forest Service (NFS), the National Wildlife Federation, and the Department of Defense (DoD) have developed new ecological protection measures that can help address the potential effects of wildlife pollution on habitat for large vertebrate species. Environmental impacts include:\n\n\u2014 increased carbon dioxide use, especially by terrestrial vertebrates\n\nConduct surveys and evaluate the quality and completeness of surveys\n\n\u2014 greater habitat fragmentation for large mammalian species\n\n\u2014 increased impacts upon sea ecosystem ecology\n\n\u2014 higher levels of exposure to natural and man-made pollutants\n\n\u2014 loss of valuable water resources\n\n\u2014 habitat loss, particularly for species with limited ability to live in shallow marine habitats\n\n\u2014 higher temperatures and higher temperatures of the ocean for large mammals (including most marine mammals)\n\n\u2014 reduced biodiversity through degradation of coral, plant, and animal species\n\n\u2014 higher rates of habitat destruction\n\n\u2014 increased risk of climate change\n\n\u2014 increased risk of extinction of large mammal species due to the effects of overfishing\n\nAn important aspect of ecosystem protection is the assessment of the impact of wildlife pollution on habitat for vertebrate species and for other habitats. The NRC study assessed the potential impacts of wildlife pollution by examining the effects of habitat loss and destruction on other species of long distance terrestrial vertebrates, a key element of their habitats. An example of extensive losses of habitat occurred with the capture of an extremely large specimen from Northern Virginia to the eastern United States, resulting in the loss of about two-thirds of the northern and central region. An even more important aspect of habitat management is the monitoring of wildlife populations, habitat conservation, restoration and conservation efforts, and the use of new technologies to protect the habitat of many species of high density terrestrial vertebrates (particularly walruses) as well as terrestrial animals.\n\n\"This new study highlights the fact that wildlife is a major contributor to ecosystem and ecosystem quality of a species, but we need to make sure we protect the biodiversity of large vertebrates first,\" said Dr. David C.

The Japanese all @ - @ female musical theatre troupe Takarazuka Revue staged this musical in 2005 in two productions, \"Battles in My Soul\" (1997) and \"The Song of Bess\" (2002).\n\n\n, ). Ernest in Love was staged off @ - @ Broadway. The Japanese all @ - @ female musical theatre troupe Takarazuka Revue staged this musical in 2005 in two productions, \"Battles in My Soul\" (1997) and \"The Song of Bess\" (2002). Ernest won the Golden Lion Award for Best Musical (2003) for his performance of \"Yoshi Kiyoshi: The Beginning\".\n\n\nHe was a friend of the actress Hana Shun, and worked at the L.P.C. during the 1980s. He has written three books with the title \"Lethal Child\" (2003), and one with the title \"Lethal Child, and Love in a Lonely Heart\".\n\nIn addition, he has written the screenplay for the novel \"Battles in My Soul\", which was adapted into a comic book novel in 2008.\n\n\nIn 2009, Ernest was nominated by the US literary community for his role as the new \"American\" protagonist. When asked by The Hollywood Reporter (the film adaptation of which had already won five Academy Awards), 'American' turned down the role, and chose instead \"The World's Favorite Play\".\n\n\nIn February 2005, Ernest was nominated for two Tony Awards, the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, and one for \"The New Shakespearean Shakespearean\". During that year, he announced himself as a \"voice actor\". He received a Golden Seal in 2007 and this year won his second Academy Award, a Golden Certificate in 2009, a Golden Certificate in 2010, and a Platinum Certificate in 2012.\n\n\nIn January 2012, Ernest released \"Inquisitively Unaware\" which was the first work in a non-English-language novel titled \"Unnamed\", directed by Kiyoshi Fujida. Ernest's lyrics are used here, in addition to the lyrics to \"Battles\".\n\n\nTrivia\n\nHe is a very talented singing voice actor. [1]\n\n\nHe is also known as \"Mr. Hairy\" in one of the first episodes of the short fiction \"Cousin on the Run\". On that occasion, Hairy is seen walking to the restaurant \"Mr. Hairy's Tavern\", who, in reply to Hairy's name, says \"Hi, nice to meet you\". He walks on foot and disappears when that person passes by and so has no time to take the picture. One of the guys that got him into trouble for doing this, was his girlfriend who also tried to get him to stop, and he also was \"shocked\" at his performance (\"Kun\", a kun means \"waking up\").","token_len":607,"entropy":[10.0127,0.2812,8.7106,8.4512,7.5268,2.7341,10.8486,15.6202,10.9996,6.91,4.7184,7.6429,2.021,2.697,9.2172,8.6929,9.3516,2.386,0.7619,12.2404,7.0086,3.8756,4.7102,0.0614,10.8243,3.631,1.3456,0.5,8.9478,1.5508,5.6394,3.7105,4.4407,2.4298,7.4564,3.9701,8.0798,5.5773,2.6681,3.6765,4.6213,3.3489,0.6256,4.0429,5.7179,4.6162,0.2714,2.0601,4.3816,0.3452,0.114,0.0974,2.516,5.5849,0.4315,5.0523,2.805,2.0463,0.0195,2.4649,0.2527,3.2627,0.0007,8.2354,8.2259,6.988,1.2642,0.0527,0.1942,0.0215,2.7352,0.0506,0.1405,0.0158,0.03,0.0005,0.0041,0.0152,0.0067,0.1533,0.0208,0.002,0.0189,0.0015,0.0101,0.0026,0.0005,0.1396,0.0002,0.0005,0.0041,0.0021,0.0012,0.0014,0.0007,0.0005,0.0015,0.0026,0.0011,0.0015,0.0004,0.0006,0.0042,0.0007,0.0001,0.0016,0.002,0.0033,0.0015,0.0017,0.0008,0.0017,0.0018,0.0007,0.0035,0.0011,0.0002,0.0002,0.0019,0.0003,0.001,0.0006,0.0009,0.0248,3.4196,6.7853,0.9959,3.5272,2.8454,2.3207,0.7082,1.1478,1.5575,4.0536,4.071,0.7755,0.9419,0.7562,1.1571,1.567,0.672,5.6883,3.8408,5.7992,4.1327,1.8994,2.8906,1.6829,5.2223,2.9103,1.1655,0.0003,3.7898,1.38,2.672,5.5883,0.2735,2.2235,4.7743,4.5088,1.8265,4.4838,2.7243,2.4072,1.6799,3.9519,3.2412,1.1694,5.8024,1.5189,4.1556,0.0776,4.3237,0.1651,5.0564,0.7015,4.0712,0.1258,0.9631,1.4923,3.3493,2.8307,3.6033,1.8857,4.2066,2.3426,2.7242,0.7489,4.3633,5.407,0.0444,5.9542,1.3995,0.7446,3.8297,1.3202,2.2208,3.8182,0.8998,0.3866,0.224,0.091,2.8617,0.1107,0.0276,0.9606,4.1981,4.9092,4.6592,3.0816,2.0405,4.997,1.4564,0.755,2.555,0.0003,2.7525,4.189,1.7195,1.1426,1.5228,1.6034,3.8901,3.2752,0.2285,1.3094,4.5387,0.7796,4.2036,0.9103,0.0089,0.1484,0.0873,0.0153,1.5815,1.2624,1.0261,1.9525,1.2445,0.6006,5.0121,0.2898,4.8349,1.4149,3.2884,0.3964,1.5836,0.0003,2.4928,3.0235,0.1782,0.8365,1.7406,1.8338,3.5074,0.9182,4.5284,5.1883,2.3363,0.428,1.541,2.3535,0.7339,2.019,5.9361,3.337,4.7943,2.7649,4.9506,3.3125,6.2931,2.444,2.3663,2.8575,1.6864,0.0057,5.6347,3.8065,4.432,3.1617,0.7332,2.7979,3.1575,2.1183,3.1325,5.0901,0.9424,0.1053,1.4887,7.0588,2.5175,0.9379,5.597,1.1518,0.6466,1.7578,1.1388,2.81,5.4375,2.4309,3.1927,3.1109,5.7928,1.2759,4.8475,4.9633,3.5778,1.1101,0.0003,1.4684,4.9971,5.5896,0.1084,0.6404,1.428,1.4424,0.3947,3.924,3.2922,0.2736,1.5556,2.2203,6.9576,0.3103,4.6674,0.1462,0.0012,2.7314,3.3573,1.1911,4.2979,2.7183,3.1028,2.1357,3.0995,5.8219,1.8685,4.6103,1.6468,3.377,5.2358,2.7336,1.2029,0.1695,0.6128,6.6023,5.7746,0.3578,1.4692,3.0019,5.3869,1.3838,2.9645,2.2585,3.1209,1.6603,3.3227,5.7028,2.1589,2.6727,2.0628,6.1557,0.5989,3.39,3.3954,1.2886,1.7917,0.0275,2.2145,3.9748,1.5521,5.959,1.2422,1.8344,1.0945,3.5766,0.7384,2.515,0.3732,0.3242,0.3531,0.3352,0.5659,5.8398,1.2421,0.1648,1.6514,0.1413,1.0075,0.0003,1.0037,3.6464,2.0442,0.0689,0.6241,4.8028,2.557,5.0067,5.3092,0.4068,2.8006,2.5582,4.4489,4.2315,1.2515,3.2241,1.2997,1.9596,0.6926,4.6783,2.2949,2.1751,4.2543,0.1719,2.0664,1.7632,0.1388,2.9358,6.0603,0.4893,5.6225,5.2718,3.6584,3.31,0.0319,4.9126,1.9705,0.6341,4.7269,5.4462,0.7375,3.1526,1.8482,6.1064,2.0141,5.6254,5.5182,2.6927,2.8776,2.7471,0.0157,1.4905,2.1287,3.3141,1.0465,2.6192,0.0677,0.0011,4.3878,0.6952,0.0003,6.5346,0.8811,0.0004,1.8919,1.1292,2.6203,3.961,3.3013,5.6887,1.6976,0.2505,0.768,3.9699,0.9435,0.0216,1.6525,0.0003,1.5282,1.0993,2.5549,1.9752,1.1287,1.1187,4.9293,0.3814,5.1021,4.5338,1.7713,1.2204,6.0857,0.2548,1.0529,3.9382,3.5098,0.1574,1.1404,5.9939,4.7758,1.7409,4.9619,5.2422,0.2654,5.7677,0.9664,3.7908,0.7368,6.1351,4.4179,4.2539,0.2024,2.3346,0.0357,2.4607,1.9659,4.6296,3.2331,0.7742,4.1556,4.8057,3.0455,0.215,0.6363,0.0053,1.1899,4.7317,1.4482,4.1127,3.889,2.5629,6.962,0.2844,2.1994,0.0067,0.4045,4.84,0.1914,2.8686,1.1295,3.2875,0.8496,4.8524,0.4315,0.5152,0.0467,1.9172,2.9334,5.618,4.6047,2.6412,1.6042,4.7979,4.1058,5.7372,3.0157,5.2791,0.537,3.8896,5.136,5.2897,1.539,3.6585,0.2286,4.725,3.1219,4.2868,0.4915,6.0879,1.0198,0.5105,6.0222,3.4838,5.524,2.2888,2.5046,1.5569,2.455,3.7724,1.53,2.2481,2.7001,3.4768,3.3136,3.7166,3.4605,5.0679,0.1435,1.9618,0.5665,1.3027,2.2003,2.3833,1.9476,1.8834,4.6556,4.388,5.137,5.0277,0.6217,0.6254,2.3873,2.9133,4.8665,6.4435,5.6196,5.9188,5.233,5.0393,5.8652,1.246,4.8268,0.6459,5.4817,4.312,0.2669,1.1351]}
{"id":2122,"ended":true,"length":533,"gen_text":"Wilhelm Busch was born on 15 April 1832, the first of seven children to the marriage of Henriette Kleine and Friedrich Wilhelm Busch. His six siblings followed shortly after : Fanny ( 1834 \u2013 '06 ), Charles ( 1825 \u2013 '18 ) and Hermann ( 1823-1847 ). These parents were all also born in Germany.\n\nThe eldest, Friedrich, married a Dutch woman called Somma van Beest, married a Dutch citizen of Amsterdam, and married and held the position as governor of the City of Johannesburg, where he spent his life from 1848-1849. But when Thomas Busch became a member of the ruling Free Nationalists who were now the governing Workers Party of North East Germany, it was announced that the second children were Georgina Bergenke, Mogens, Hans Vollenhuysch, Hans J\u00fcrgen Busch, and G\u00fcnter Busch, and that after Friedrich died, the eldest twin, Georgina, became the youngest living family, and the other siblings were born and remarried in 1864 ; while his brother Friedrich Friedrich remained a part of the Free Nationalists in Bavaria until 1868. This further led to some clashes between the Free Nationalists of the city and the German Social Democrats. Both members of the Left Social Democrat leadership supported the creation of the Social Democratic Republic (SA) in 1875. In 1895, the Free Nationalists elected their new government in the newly formed Christian Social Confederation (CSC), and held the Constitutional Convention (C) in 1896, following that the birth of Friedrich and others who represented the Social Democrats of the same state.\n\nIn 1919, Franz Franz Busch (born 17 December 1899, in Vienna, the German city of Nuremberg) was elected president of the German Third State at the age of 36. Franz Franz Busch lived in Vienna until 1933 and then travelled to the United States before becoming a student in University City, New York where he later studied history at Rutgers University. In 1945, after working as a printer, he became a member of the Jewish community, was elected as a delegate of the National Council of Palestine, and served in the United States Senate. During World War II, Franz Busch gave the famous \"Let's Have A Merry Christmas\" address as part of his speech to the Jewish community.

{"id":4097,"ended":false,"length":564,"gen_text":"The South's Oldest Rivalry between North Carolina and its first opponent, the University of Virginia, was prominent throughout the first third of the twentieth century. The 119th meeting in football between the 'N' Carolina and the 'Buck' Virginia (later dubbed the Virginia Tech' in response to the fact that the 'Buck' has a 'w' in their name) was played before the War broke out in '17 after both teams were swept of 'Washington.' As one observer of the team's 'battles' remarked, 'It was so good that if it had been won in four minutes, North Carolina would definitely have lost.' In other words, the rivalry between the two teams would never have started.\n\nBut since the 1960s with Virginia, the rivalry between North Carolina and Virginia Tech has continued. South Carolina was the first school to officially compete in the NFL playoffs in 1973 with Washington. Both teams are currently unbeaten but Virginia Tech's record is no less than 16-2. As part of their recent effort to prove itself, both teams released a statement about some of the key statistics.\n\nNorth Carolina, the oldest school in the Carolina State University System, won four straight in 2008. Virginia Tech, meanwhile, is undefeated in seven of their last ten games. South Carolina has the worst turnover rate among the 10 teams in the conference (6.7 percent), so there's no reason North Carolina can't be a contender in the playoffs this season. This is especially true considering Virginia's record for a winless season since 1967, when that team won eight straight. That's a lot of losses, but one which will only become even harder as Virginia enters the postseason.\n\nVirginia Tech, by contrast, has gone 6-7 on the season, including a 6-0 mark against South Carolina in a season when the 'Buck' was in the midst of a season-less national title drought. And that's before Virginia Tech wins one game for the first time ever over a winning team during the same year.\n\nBut these two teams have different philosophies, and their differences certainly matter. Both of them are fighting for a top-flight run after the bye to determine who starts the season with three wins in five matches and a 2-0 lead over a defense that ranked dead last in defense last season. There are plenty of reasons to think one of these teams will turn its sights on the N.C. State's Super Bowl crown \u2013 and to think that Virginia Tech won't take that chance. As one veteran observer noted during an interview, 'These two teams seem to not be in competition for that top spot at the moment... if one of them turns that year around and we reach this point, we could see a major upset.'\"\n\nSo this rivalry should all be just a matter of time before Virginia Tech's big win over Virginia Tech comes knocking on their door in November\n\nVirginia Tech was part of the league before 'BC' was introduced in 1976","token_len":608,"entropy":[7.8688,4.5826,9.0162,1.0614,6.5701,2.8843,7.0707,4.5903,4.5537,0.1635,4.926,6.5273,4.1502,0.9026,1.6082,2.0888,0.0036,3.3734,0.2242,2.1848,10.537,4.249,0.481,4.6797,8.2205,0.134,0.2464,3.1807,0.0057,0.4739,1.8938,11.906,1.766,5.8985,4.1047,10.7521,3.0856,0.7158,7.2254,4.5206,4.3688,4.1779,1.1767,1.1201,0.3873,3.1809,3.0603,1.6061,1.6658,3.9025,3.8005,5.3401,0.6851,3.2519,2.2325,5.8448,3.9627,5.3223,0.1892,0.6129,3.08,0.1224,0.9207,2.1603,0.5763,0.1253,0.065,5.5613,2.0399,3.8043,5.7842,0.9355,1.071,2.78,0.8439,0.3693,1.0106,4.0318,4.3518,0.6235,5.581,5.6059,0.0098,1.2782,5.9691,2.5769,6.0837,4.4069,0.5449,2.1956,4.7529,5.5292,3.0722,5.1733,2.8585,4.5352,4.0853,2.3369,4.1212,0.4408,6.3375,1.8672,3.6824,4.9189,2.2169,0.5183,0.2803,3.2653,0.5176,0.7851,2.5656,0.7595,4.0817,3.1798,1.6092,4.4974,3.1818,1.5048,0.704,3.0211,3.1909,5.9313,3.2401,0.8323,5.9391,0.0195,0.3592,7.3373,0.2938,2.6337,1.1841,3.3195,3.5769,0.0248,0.0586,1.2489,2.8449,1.0123,0.7533,0.6276,1.2594,3.1637,3.1454,0.3266,4.7442,1.2814,0.8107,0.0116,3.8725,5.736,0.9972,5.7861,0.129,6.9038,3.5054,2.1164,1.2687,0.8548,0.6112,1.6156,0.024,0.0885,0.8254,1.2851,0.3093,2.7687,1.5435,5.1546,0.0165,3.6234,2.1092,1.9066,2.9545,0.5161,4.6758,4.3958,0.5087,0.5102,3.8003,3.2945,1.6954,3.8367,3.746,5.8565,2.3649,4.8304,0.2926,3.3287,2.8562,4.2228,4.9561,4.0724,0.374,2.7594,3.0771,1.2068,5.3152,2.0546,3.6102,4.1087,0.1085,2.3543,1.0,4.2557,5.0602,0.0013,2.134,4.0649,4.6168,0.1943,4.7547,5.3678,1.6493,2.7309,0.263,6.0483,0.9467,1.542,3.637,7.4561,0.6918,0.7036,5.4997,4.4717,3.3894,0.8569,0.0002,4.1775,0.0041,3.6735,2.908,3.9947,2.3158,0.3167,0.3686,5.6138,4.482,1.6909,1.2916,0.4612,3.7098,4.3865,1.7408,3.906,5.7084,1.4723,3.0853,0.0757,1.7513,2.7098,0.0543,2.7782,2.545,1.3019,3.0591,0.3631,1.3993,1.2344,2.3645,0.99,0.6986,4.2129,0.002,2.0032,4.3982,4.85,6.8341,0.7797,2.7903,1.1968,4.1628,1.1302,1.044,0.2179,3.0016,2.7158,3.93,0.0538,2.6571,1.6812,1.2778,4.8979,3.8324,1.14,1.1285,1.4556,3.7597,0.0021,1.7167,0.0101,2.3741,1.6406,2.6622,1.8072,0.6037,2.4877,3.4877,1.039,0.1431,4.4963,1.5831,2.8793,0.4439,2.2413,2.6732,3.8184,2.1049,4.7021,3.9904,2.9029,0.6596,1.3703,3.0135,4.4183,2.0105,1.618,5.9446,1.2354,1.6786,3.2115,1.3649,0.7326,4.461,1.3395,1.8207,3.1901,0.1881,4.0663,1.7806,0.7827,4.4125,3.7918,3.0502,4.3177,4.3808,2.2302,3.9663,1.6688,2.3373,3.5474,0.5491,2.322,0.5615,0.3767,0.0002,2.858,0.2492,2.8843,3.9621,0.7156,0.0077,1.0237,4.6074,4.1079,0.0213,2.9023,4.3786,0.2132,0.6728,1.6897,2.1666,0.9221,3.311,0.0486,2.1637,1.8275,1.3902,3.0436,0.0012,1.6555,3.6264,3.9709,1.9457,1.2221,2.64,0.5282,0.1439,0.0568,3.4998,3.041,0.7943,3.1755,0.0081,0.848,4.5493,1.4435,7.7243,5.2092,1.8117,0.5858,0.1621,3.8205,3.2543,0.6573,3.6991,3.2481,0.9685,4.362,4.7362,2.193,4.7596,0.3483,0.3623,0.0012,3.5185,5.2194,1.7565,5.0882,0.3608,4.9188,0.865,4.9139,3.3771,0.4298,1.0722,0.0002,3.8881,5.2006,2.96,0.7131,1.7699,3.4487,2.5391,2.7203,0.8427,3.7644,3.6403,5.9161,3.6549,0.8618,3.4032,3.3379,1.2992,1.8024,4.5558,0.389,1.7072,5.0651,1.0303,3.1674,5.7818,5.6056,2.8638,4.9577,4.183,5.0516,1.7299,6.2561,1.7452,1.5632,1.7616,5.4008,2.1683,1.6992,3.094,5.5407,3.2014,1.7045,4.5017,0.1006,0.989,3.967,1.1124,2.0453,5.5925,0.5125,3.7798,4.014,0.0069,0.3676,4.6989,2.384,0.4356,0.2956,5.0548,1.675,2.8764,0.0251,1.8625,1.5218,2.516,5.4486,0.7709,1.1655,0.6549,1.1586,5.0055,3.199,3.7308,0.7527,0.8853,5.7149,0.27,0.0095,0.0322,1.3581,3.4903,4.7214,0.2048,3.5602,5.3648,1.954,3.7423,1.8668,1.1481,2.3844,0.031,3.2528,0.0569,4.597,1.9978,1.4584,0.8935,5.2697,2.4057,5.5665,3.0999,2.4073,4.6939,3.0055,0.8239,1.371,0.5126,5.5735,0.5875,0.4362,5.1886,0.5602,6.6436,2.1426,3.1405,4.1468,1.5499,3.6949,4.4152,0.5968,3.0003,0.9014,0.6468,6.2796,5.4102,4.069,0.8997,0.3782,5.0911,4.4322,4.0986,0.8823,1.7617,4.5614,5.9577,3.1919,0.8755,0.6261,1.7631,2.8706,2.2807,1.6678,4.4227,1.948,4.238,0.2359,0.0002,3.0411,4.6228,2.8241,4.6464,6.0339,0.6933,5.0058,2.0248,1.6721,0.0013,0.6049,0.973,2.0536,0.0729,2.6757,5.426,2.6531,0.9432,1.8734,0.3135,3.6852,4.8289,1.9085,1.8355,0.1467,3.5368,3.419,6.7997,0.0002,3.2263,0.0374,4.5702,5.1289,0.0091,0.5553,5.0526,5.4317,3.5282,4.6756,1.4643,2.3146,2.5598,0.9754,4.1984]}
{"id":4096,"ended":false,"length":589,"gen_text":"Dean Smith was widely known for his idea of `` The Carolina Way ``, in which he challenged his players to, `` Play hard, play smart, play together. `` ``\n\nIn one of his earliest writings, he said, `` The Carolina Way is like a game of dice.'' ''\n\nSome of his players claimed to be the only humans they ever faced: `This could not be f---ed up, let alone tested. I have no time for anything like it today.\n\n`` For a moment I could have laughed out loud at that. But my brain is so deep already.''\n\nOther players said that `` In other words, I can't look at you guys with my eyesight for any more than `I do see you, the way you look, `` or `I do see you with my eyesight for any more than `I do.'\n\nHe also said, `` In other words, I really hope some time soon, some day, we will understand, `If there's a problem with your mind, you have to step aside and let it go.``\n\nAfter his victory at the game of football, Smith later said that '' I have never seen a person who won the whole American race, when they got to be a pro,'' ` the way he described the first-time competitor, which was so important in winning the race that he won five games.\n\nSmith was an important voice in football and at the National Pro Day in 1966. He had a few words in passing with Barry Bonds that included a line, `` That's a great thing to have this one for. And if we're lucky, we can get to it if necessary.''\n\nIn his autobiography, Smith said afterward that '' When I was in this place, playing football at my age, I found all kinds of things which didn't exist when I was born: the game where we had football playing on Saturdays, we played basketball on Sundays, the games I played I played. The only thing that ever existed when I was young was when I was thirteen.\n\n`` You will tell him I did have something that had no place in your body when I was young, something I did not know when I was a little girl. I am absolutely certain about that, you people, and I am absolutely certain about everything. But I had one thing in common with you guys who did have that experience: I loved that game, that game... I want to go over that now. I'm sure you will be quite happy. Now, I would say to you people who are thinking about that game before they become professional athletes if it were not that big a deal and if they were able to take it for granted.\n\n`` And if this ever happens, you can go right ahead and do whatever that game was that you liked, and it was never one of those things that I enjoyed most.

{"id":20,"ended":false,"length":558,"gen_text":"In 2009, Fernandez traveled to India for a modeling assignment. She studied acting under the mentorship of theatre director Barry John, and successfully auditioned for Sujoy Ghosh's fantasy film Aladin (1997). After that she began working as an actress on many short films and worked for five years as an assistant producer for Khaos & Kosh.\nAn actor in the late 1940s played the director's wife on the show.\nThe casting was arranged by her parents after Fae's mother received a call from a woman named Nancy about her son's sexual preferences. Fae had been cast as the mother of three daughters after being raised by Nancy with two other stepfathers.\nIn addition to acting, Fae had a recurring role in \"The Good, Bad, Aversion of Happy Day,\" one of the last TV shows she was still attending school with while in the same school.\nOne of her first roles was in \"Beware, Beware the Wise, Beware the Fool,\" about the late Elizabeth, who discovers that she has a serious side to her who has failed miserably during the second world war.\nFernando's family moved to the city of Santa Maria on 18 May, 1955. They were not aware of her marriage to his daughter, but there were rumors that her parents had arranged for her to marry Elizabeth's sister, Margarita (Eddie Loves You), who had already had their first child.\nDuring her first appearance on the show, she was shown standing in front of Eliza in a white dress. The two married in 1959 and she later played a role in the 1962-1963 \"The Lion and the Rose,\" when the two daughters went to America together, and as a part of the cast, Eliza and her mother had been \"dying to be the princess of England.\"\nThe show also featured the daughter of a wealthy New York real estate agent. She had been playing a housewife in the 1950s for the real estate business when she met Nancy during their time working together for the TV show \"The Lion and the Rose.\"\nIn 1963, Fae was approached by her mother's husband, George Foster. A few months after they shared the stage, Foster moved in with the family. This time, Fae also worked on a part, with George working as a janitor. When George and Fae divorced in 1957, Nancy had already left the family.\nFernando's daughter, Anna, returned to Santa Maria after Fae's death. She was a little later cast as her mother's \"little helper\" daughter, and this made her eligible for the Broadway stage.\nFernando's daughter was pregnant after the wedding of Nancy and Anna to Eliza and Margarita E.

However, he may be a complete idiot on the part of the original team due to his''s tendency to go on to annoy his own friends, and most notably he has quite a few issues that can easily lead to a problem for the team, such as :\n\nHis first major problem with the anime adaptation of Doc'Doc ', came when he came up with a solution to a problem that the cartoon had: If you use your hands, they won't hurt, and if you change your shape, they won't help you with the next thing. In Doc'Doc'', you can change the shape of your hands with your right hand, so using your left hand to change a hand shape made some of the other '.\n\n'. '.\n\n\nIt also went without saying that Doc's powers as a doctor are a little bit too limited, especially towards his physical abilities. In particular, he can't use his own medicine, even in the case of the most common ailments, such as diabetes and asthma.\n\nThe \" '.\n\nReubens also has an interesting history with Yoko on the television series, where he first appeared in a cameo that featured as Doc'' after being revived from the dead, and later introduced himself at length and appeared as a companion character during the first season of season 1. However, the latter is clearly not what he really wants to appear for, but rather an older and better character, such as in season 4 which was based off of a previous season of the series where Doc '.\n\nreubens' was also an uncharacteristically difficult character to take. In spite of this, he's also one of the most respected characters in the group by any reliable group of experts, and has even got over some of the worst aspects from one of his childhood friends, even if it did turn out that he doesn't really care much about any of this whatsoever, he is rather interested in whatever he does. Additionally, he is actually kind to his friends for taking care of his problems, if the world's worst people ever came to him to help him solve his problems, he would not be surprised if he eventually stopped them... so that would even more definitely not be a bad thing.\n\nIf you are seeing a picture of Reubens after the story ends, then you may want to consider checking the credits for the anime.\n\nIn all of these cases, Reubens also seems to hold much of the blame for making the characters \"feel real,\" or for creating a \"real world\", with the only exception being that no one even noticed yet that a new character really existed.\n\nReferences Edit","token_len":608,"entropy":[6.4204,10.0775,4.2584,7.9528,12.055,7.0794,6.826,5.0947,11.4305,0.2734,8.359,7.42,2.5986,6.2275,1.5645,10.8712,0.9588,4.3173,5.6663,10.0311,2.1767,2.3305,5.2573,1.3916,1.5563,6.4088,5.5126,2.116,2.7605,9.868,1.0454,1.8008,19.9349,13.947,8.5089,1.5975,13.6137,8.9912,2.5084,0.105,5.1486,1.1512,5.3926,0.0003,4.6939,6.0251,1.4643,0.0033,0.2136,3.9559,0.0334,0.0155,1.513,1.7834,4.9141,0.7887,0.0357,1.9014,6.0084,10.2523,4.2947,1.3251,2.841,2.381,2.3829,4.6711,1.3798,4.0504,1.3709,3.8708,0.1552,1.5228,5.0597,1.7381,2.2903,6.8713,2.3632,4.8991,1.7095,4.6217,0.0028,1.4546,5.0476,4.218,5.1589,0.0271,1.1696,12.1561,2.9336,4.0292,0.1377,4.5502,3.1331,4.0119,5.4759,2.538,3.6507,3.4938,1.9722,1.619,5.8481,2.0605,4.3627,2.1826,5.4887,0.4313,1.632,3.9649,4.7488,3.2862,4.2148,2.1653,0.2091,2.6863,5.4151,3.8348,1.603,1.6682,2.1488,0.925,0.002,5.1131,1.8999,0.0002,4.6448,3.9566,3.7663,2.084,2.3284,0.9533,5.0893,4.5405,1.9875,7.5509,3.4066,0.0897,9.8078,4.2393,1.0714,0.8188,5.0546,1.7014,0.2473,1.0193,3.8412,0.8244,2.3864,1.2896,1.2736,2.7827,4.2406,1.9447,5.0468,5.8496,1.8467,3.8997,3.875,3.2738,1.2326,3.0193,2.5699,0.0408,3.4496,3.0349,1.1319,1.2489,0.3461,6.2173,1.4358,5.7868,0.6808,0.9495,0.824,0.0074,4.3026,0.9919,3.9062,2.0722,3.8752,3.1424,1.0675,3.446,3.2862,0.3484,0.0063,1.2171,2.4303,2.5872,1.4692,2.2131,1.9546,0.8361,0.1776,0.6528,0.6822,3.5303,2.1394,3.4036,0.2976,0.8082,3.1602,7.0141,0.4056,0.4453,0.1992,2.9802,1.302,3.7582,3.6615,1.1833,6.1871,5.7517,2.3943,0.7932,3.4924,13.8669,3.4768,0.0003,2.4363,4.7139,1.4915,0.0003,3.4305,2.6861,4.4283,1.1712,0.0105,0.0993,2.7278,3.4507,5.2585,4.856,0.3981,4.2694,1.4596,3.5187,2.1871,2.7212,3.3286,4.8202,1.4571,3.0623,6.3274,2.2745,4.4316,0.933,0.7259,2.4856,4.0997,0.2421,1.293,2.072,0.748,1.6059,0.7323,3.631,4.5813,1.0812,3.9234,3.3389,1.3554,3.248,0.1384,2.2645,5.5064,3.4983,2.8616,1.2502,1.1919,0.0048,3.4515,1.7117,3.61,0.6601,1.7571,0.0003,3.6115,5.5128,12.6485,0.9325,0.0002,6.2534,0.1386,0.0076,2.2241,1.2951,2.8838,2.5527,4.502,0.8148,6.4823,2.7847,4.3554,0.7313,5.2268,1.1255,1.8731,2.4814,0.3904,3.115,1.5239,0.909,2.4518,4.5689,5.8061,3.9772,5.5205,4.2977,6.8646,9.616,3.7256,4.0604,1.7568,1.5544,0.3788,2.4408,1.4889,1.8415,5.7804,2.8305,4.336,7.0448,3.9581,4.1722,1.3539,2.0107,4.8889,2.0172,3.5326,0.5513,3.0883,1.3032,1.3711,5.2402,2.4544,0.7199,3.4411,0.0753,2.6409,4.4311,3.5601,4.8966,2.0351,2.9911,1.0983,2.9151,1.6703,0.7324,3.199,4.1699,1.0809,4.4862,1.0275,4.6917,4.5841,3.578,4.0073,2.4611,1.7867,4.6425,0.0244,3.4657,2.1688,2.6383,5.3332,2.5659,3.7086,2.5692,0.8669,2.1034,4.3826,3.6689,1.4137,1.025,1.5232,3.7447,1.4704,12.0774,0.6647,0.0002,4.6355,2.2204,0.0615,3.2231,7.6386,2.2301,3.4252,5.5151,2.0808,1.4905,4.8245,0.0927,0.231,5.1458,5.6924,2.2039,5.17,0.0101,3.2739,0.2258,0.7047,3.3351,4.1523,2.6144,0.0255,0.1062,1.5941,5.3327,1.6461,0.4811,0.2917,4.9436,4.8842,5.7336,6.3272,3.9062,1.4029,4.7289,1.103,0.9976,2.5209,3.5021,5.3796,4.6755,3.5578,0.3561,0.5903,2.6813,4.6666,5.3312,5.5595,0.4068,1.4085,5.3394,1.7861,1.1123,4.9142,2.4224,1.8611,5.4641,5.9414,0.1562,1.4225,0.7931,4.3764,0.0126,1.5595,2.1775,2.4196,0.8584,4.4254,0.1038,2.254,3.1736,2.3559,3.4475,3.1335,3.9089,3.8224,0.1103,5.8212,1.8777,2.9262,1.8077,6.3665,0.0911,1.1288,1.9508,3.9069,4.152,3.1506,1.5735,1.6473,5.2068,4.3233,1.2848,0.0095,3.1171,3.2195,0.6791,5.7102,3.6171,5.4336,3.9978,2.7039,3.9732,3.1777,3.9511,0.9829,1.715,3.0656,1.4142,0.498,3.3786,1.9553,0.3922,0.8943,0.7804,0.5917,3.8733,2.0475,4.3132,1.1963,1.2743,4.7472,4.9662,3.2563,5.2208,5.1942,2.7187,2.843,6.1135,1.4636,5.3405,3.567,0.4074,1.4518,0.8337,0.1104,0.7309,0.6575,0.0003,5.2681,0.7072,3.0932,6.1395,2.6923,3.7838,0.177,0.5661,0.0109,0.0045,5.8669,1.463,4.4826,2.0919,0.3741,2.8051,0.893,1.8828,1.9652,0.0043,3.2336,3.1827,2.2407,4.4891,1.9401,1.1735,2.0998,2.3245,0.901,0.0003,2.9861,5.5886,2.3229,2.9837,2.1545,0.2153,1.6899,0.0118,0.0107,5.2526,2.5314,0.2524,6.2985,5.0594,1.8052,0.8995,1.2838,0.3804,5.4889,1.0088,3.4273,5.1143,3.604,5.4468,3.7137,3.5349,2.754,4.223,2.1124,2.8771,2.9714,1.9042,3.7833,4.4828,1.6487,3.3318,1.0881,0.8159,2.485,5.8998,0.5015,4.3491,3.4559,5.8592,2.3664,4.3799,4.089,1.3163,5.2538,2.1024,1.1221,1.0136,0.0003,5.4213,0.8487]}

It began deploying from Wendover 4 June 1945, with the first Bf 109th Bombardment Battalion returning to Wendover on 1 July.\n\nThe Bf 109th Bombardment Battalion also deployed to Normandy on 2 March 1945 to assist the F1R as part of the First Battalion's 4th Air Raid. It arrived at Obergatan and its aircraft was destroyed.\n\nThe Bf 109th Bombardment Battalion was established on 5 May 1945, and became the new squadron, after being transferred to 9th Troop Carrier Squadron of the 3rd Air Assault Wing on 8 June 1945. It was stationed at Obergatan until 4 September, when it was transferred to the 3rd Air Assault Wing.\n\nOn 29 August 1941 the first Bf 109th Bombardment Battalion received a formal training instruction, during which it underwent its first operational demonstration of the new aerial transport, and an attempt at a complete flight test. It flew from Obergatan with the 9th Air Carrier Wing on 2 March 1946 in line with the formation of the 9th Bombardment Battalion. At 3 August 1945, it was deployed from Obergatan to Ostend on a scheduled basis, to serve the remainder of the day, which was the first time the regiment became active in the air.\n\nBf 109th Bombardment Battalion and F3R Squadron were commissioned on 7 March 1951 at Gelsenkirchen, Germany.\n\nThe Bf 109th Bombardment Battalion was the 1st Bombardment Squadron, established in 9 December 1941 at Obergatan, until 15 August 1942 the 24th Bombardment Battalion and their respective 1st Bombardment Wing at Uwer- und Weiten, Germany.\n\nDuring WW2, the Bf 109th Bombardment Battalion was stationed at Obergatan on an unannounced basis. It was assigned to the 3rd Air Assault Wing at Gendarmerie on 20 May 1949, after an unannounced mission at Obergatan. The Bf 109th Bombardment Battalion at Obergatan was the only unit stationed in Germany that was used exclusively for aerial reconnaissance during WWII, even as part of the 2nd Battalion's 761st Bf 109 Bomber Field Division.\n\nWith the deployment of the 2nd Bf 109th Fighter Squadron to Gelsenkirchen in 1951, the first of the 2nd Bombardment Company was created. The Bf 109th Bomber Force operated from Obergatan, Germany.\n\n.\n\nBf 109th Bombardment Battalion was established as a Special Weapons Unit for the 781st Bombardment Squadron. During the war, the 3rd Bf 109th Bomber Command Post at Obergatan was also responsible for the development of the A-17 \"Buster Strike\".","token_len":608,"entropy":[8.0856,12.1782,5.729,0.0135,8.4314,0.1253,2.8704,7.4315,0.0703,0.5026,9.3807,4.5876,4.1981,6.6044,0.9953,0.3605,2.0231,2.371,1.4659,8.8164,0.2159,8.1752,0.7267,0.3307,1.3068,6.8469,2.4017,8.288,0.9397,2.624,4.1668,5.4771,6.6806,3.1266,1.4833,0.001,8.3007,4.3151,2.4901,1.7667,2.9778,1.2074,2.3626,6.3972,2.0978,0.1538,4.7676,2.2348,0.0294,0.0337,4.2617,4.0058,1.1118,0.9071,0.0022,1.1884,3.3356,1.0107,1.8814,2.3168,0.0043,1.493,2.8549,0.0726,0.0363,0.0298,1.0815,0.0051,0.0017,0.1894,4.9751,2.474,1.3195,5.9106,1.4614,2.579,3.5923,0.8191,3.8436,2.7132,1.4962,5.1667,3.9498,3.9593,5.4026,1.4503,0.0006,0.7096,4.9776,3.4337,1.8595,4.9233,0.3429,3.2526,5.5377,2.1175,2.721,3.7668,0.8473,5.8176,5.0102,11.1523,3.9271,5.0445,4.4026,2.5424,3.0694,1.3647,1.3336,0.0002,1.2889,2.0199,0.0098,0.0119,0.0116,0.2538,0.004,0.0009,0.188,1.6346,5.2607,1.5184,3.694,2.0071,0.4477,1.7212,1.801,4.4848,0.9889,5.3638,4.8963,4.1678,3.876,2.6185,3.4723,0.4776,6.1246,0.9095,3.8533,0.0247,0.0317,0.288,4.6061,0.6125,3.3838,0.201,2.4003,2.8947,4.5077,2.2444,3.1514,1.3719,0.5074,0.1831,1.9605,1.1439,4.547,0.4364,2.2039,0.0584,0.0465,2.6054,3.4286,2.5785,2.6984,0.7636,0.3176,0.681,1.1516,0.0841,0.9666,2.8415,0.0873,0.7637,0.1231,0.0247,1.0245,0.8133,0.0001,3.0054,3.6541,2.3893,5.1269,1.8437,3.3856,1.0491,0.0233,0.0134,0.0273,0.169,0.0045,0.0009,0.0968,4.9067,1.7953,5.152,3.374,4.6208,2.6264,5.8988,0.0754,0.773,5.1956,4.1252,0.7144,3.3759,5.3265,1.7242,1.2765,2.9797,5.2879,4.6744,3.9071,2.6301,4.7049,5.3628,2.0265,2.3028,4.5239,3.6706,0.78,1.1578,2.4457,2.5542,3.5961,0.4472,0.0292,0.0069,4.4189,1.1993,5.3538,0.0806,1.9563,6.6863,2.1913,1.6162,2.9539,2.5901,3.5351,4.7635,5.7014,0.0872,0.8275,5.3767,1.0549,0.2917,3.5461,0.0407,2.3516,0.0255,0.0072,0.7378,0.4624,4.2263,4.0319,3.2263,2.3476,0.7037,1.6645,1.4731,3.3766,2.71,0.277,0.0078,0.0027,0.7799,5.2838,1.7145,2.9056,2.1678,5.0064,4.696,1.8124,3.2225,5.0257,3.2641,3.1607,0.0016,0.202,2.6859,3.0123,4.7463,1.2407,2.4014,1.8679,2.241,1.6217,2.9222,6.0472,2.6675,1.0365,1.4176,1.1485,0.7637,0.5324,0.0001,3.7241,0.2773,0.0096,0.0123,0.242,0.0048,0.0019,0.4765,4.3948,3.9103,4.5905,0.3136,3.3504,2.9179,4.1678,1.2289,3.566,2.6589,4.0413,3.9281,5.3776,4.5361,0.0023,0.0073,0.0676,0.8511,0.5922,0.5941,1.3784,0.0002,1.7483,1.6999,0.0202,0.014,0.0066,0.0616,0.0024,0.0007,0.084,1.0171,2.8704,4.8003,0.0099,3.2583,0.1286,0.0073,2.1305,2.0736,4.7821,1.3842,5.5211,2.694,2.0552,2.9778,2.5211,0.1323,0.0385,1.4913,5.1082,5.1595,3.227,1.2482,5.3546,4.7266,0.0169,0.5866,0.0577,0.0049,0.8173,3.4217,6.1389,4.574,3.8664,0.005,1.4319,0.0168,0.0196,2.4735,3.8413,6.0756,6.1827,3.2056,3.3118,5.6692,3.7031,1.4373,1.4435,0.8291,0.3462,0.9555,0.0002,3.8374,5.0548,0.4811,0.7624,0.5142,1.3034,0.0208,0.0079,0.007,0.1256,0.0039,0.0008,0.2359,1.1173,3.254,0.398,1.554,0.0487,0.0105,3.4768,3.8953,4.8312,2.5662,0.3167,1.5254,1.7099,0.8467,2.6742,0.3308,0.7026,2.9915,0.0187,0.7097,0.0928,0.0533,2.0035,4.5757,6.4653,0.0251,0.002,1.7218,3.6775,2.6112,5.5307,1.18,3.4929,4.0306,3.2246,0.0915,3.5656,2.4507,1.7301,0.0889,0.0197,0.8954,1.9506,2.0117,0.015,0.0064,0.0038,0.0918,0.003,0.0012,0.1919,5.7518,1.1772,0.0862,0.0059,1.1204,2.8957,2.5781,2.3209,4.2343,1.3488,3.0159,3.1771,1.7458,5.0894,3.3381,0.8195,2.6306,1.7761,3.4236,3.2668,2.0212,5.7027,3.5881,2.7997,0.0011,0.2959,3.5307,0.0574,2.6604,1.5744,4.3026,6.9892,0.072,4.3906,0.2829,0.1153,6.2497,5.9742,3.0015,0.4309,0.5725,0.0002,5.8115,0.6373,4.1524,0.153,0.2961,3.5689,0.0077,2.8245,0.0467,0.0174,2.934,6.3222,1.0106,1.7737,3.8135,1.6806,0.0021,0.0014,0.0005,1.7782,3.7422,0.1701,0.3612,3.0623,3.2309,0.5231,2.1992,0.1329,1.8764,0.0109,0.0268,4.6867,2.5509,4.6754,1.0952,1.1083,1.8393,0.0147,0.0117,0.0141,2.4094,6.492,4.9798,2.1651,1.226,0.1129,0.0092,2.0416,1.8268,1.5649,1.1164,0.0002,8.3882,0.8022,0.0003,2.8887,0.4607,0.026,0.052,0.8818,0.0045,0.0034,0.6402,1.7168,2.6935,2.7747,1.1871,4.4941,4.7454,1.9318,3.3572,0.5005,3.6663,5.0023,0.0188,1.4094,0.1251,0.0074,0.9805,1.8258,3.7518,0.8199,1.7517,0.3708,0.728,4.3287,0.0117,2.4473,0.0479,0.0609,0.5063,1.6757,4.6098,5.9319,1.8439,1.159,0.1225,0.0093,0.9134,4.6572,4.0842,0.0069,1.1469,3.4346,0.2878,0.6186,5.1064,0.9112,4.0108,5.0659,2.8528,4.4381,5.6503,2.8303]}
{"id":283,"ended":false,"length":530,"gen_text":"In Finkelstein's doctoral thesis, he examined the claims made in Joan Peters's From Time Immemorial, a best @ - @ selling book at the time. Peters's `` history and political writings in the United States \u00a0reflect those of Joan Peters, who wrote about politics in her own words. In the course of her work she has provided a valuable commentary in several aspects of a country's history but she also took part in the most influential and diverse of her country's popular and cultural movements during the early 1970s, and most recently in her early '80s essay on American cultural history.\nWhen she visited Washington after being elected to President she was told that people who were dissatisfied were taking their money home because '' they had no way to pay the mortgage with their own money, or they were not going to pay off their own loans.''\nCatherine Johnson's book has since been published in three English languages.\nHere are excerpts from it, edited together from Johnson's and the author's blogs. As part of our research, I asked about the difference between a political statement made by a nation's leaders and a ''statement given to the public in any number of languages. In politics, for example, a party leader can speak English as the American language, although it is very different from a political statement where they want to present the country as a better place for working people, with higher incomes and better opportunities than the country as a whole.''\n(Peters, p. 8)\nCatherine Johnson's book had a subtitle of two days. It was entitled ''Injustice, Poverty, Poverty', and had an excerpt from one episode. It appeared in Johnson's\u00a0 New Left \u00a0and in the book, and as part of a postprint on her site, Johnson has used this title in both her political writings and a blog post she has put up which appears in Johnson's new essay on her blog:\nJohnson's politics are often criticized as reactionary or politically naive\nThe word feminist was first used by the political philosopher John Marshall in\u00a0 The Meaning and Definition of Feminism, which he wrote in 1963 for The New Republic \u00a0. The word\u00a0 feminist arose not from the use of feminist pronouns (e.g., women did not\u00a0 have any form of\u00a0feminism ) but from a sense of\u00a0feminine, non-specific\u00a0identities and roles (e.g., women had different\u00a0 roles in society, where the world's women were male.\u00a0 I thought Marshall's analysis was clever and\u00a0well worth taking a stab at. \u00a0It is hard to say where it originated from, however, since it was usually used almost exclusively in one gender group that was also male and so of more importance to the broader picture. One of my favorite examples was my\u00a0 article for Forbes \u00a0about\u00a0feminism (\u00a0 http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/nytimes\/2009\/04\/11\/the-best-feminist-menace\/","token_len":609,"entropy":[10.6641,4.2587,0.9754,1.354,9.8704,0.9019,0.7232,1.983,4.464,0.932,7.4955,1.9119,2.0813,10.5794,7.535,1.0021,8.9897,5.8453,9.8363,0.3107,0.0001,1.6476,1.5765,6.7701,17.0523,9.0682,4.5528,10.6726,0.6949,5.8896,1.3585,0.9419,1.1354,3.2315,2.4358,11.4301,11.9679,3.9124,4.7691,4.1364,3.704,1.2768,2.9741,0.0233,3.8677,0.6212,6.1848,6.2189,0.4034,3.3526,0.088,1.5136,1.9898,3.5948,2.8558,2.6271,1.5277,1.7723,1.3747,1.8052,2.1089,2.6237,2.3521,4.3093,0.0107,1.2335,2.0393,2.5717,3.0095,4.6225,1.5493,3.1196,4.244,3.7813,5.6411,4.135,0.1239,5.5893,4.7918,0.8152,1.632,6.2857,2.6744,1.502,4.7674,3.6353,0.0436,1.8688,4.8787,4.3267,2.8767,5.5886,3.4446,3.0264,4.2927,0.3108,5.6186,2.7494,3.4831,1.2698,5.4238,0.7256,3.4307,4.3465,0.1186,1.9869,2.6548,5.6335,1.3233,0.9353,1.9046,5.8001,2.8095,2.1032,0.0102,5.2926,2.4346,3.1895,4.8939,1.7787,1.4871,3.1317,4.9627,2.7604,5.2258,3.8005,5.6453,4.8203,2.0577,1.1992,5.1027,4.1855,2.2736,3.9729,0.8285,5.6805,2.648,2.2209,5.2944,4.4717,5.5674,2.5257,4.8342,5.7646,4.3799,4.4661,3.8611,2.4844,1.9548,3.8378,0.7088,1.9789,2.2705,2.7702,6.157,1.0338,2.1839,0.3595,2.0769,2.0355,1.9431,1.0705,2.9927,2.6225,0.0345,2.1846,4.6969,0.4215,2.6251,1.3354,1.6141,2.3975,5.5782,3.7793,5.7291,2.9877,2.5581,4.7256,4.6363,0.7229,2.0874,1.2417,3.9275,3.175,2.9224,1.5466,2.416,5.5853,1.5027,2.883,0.2526,3.5761,2.1775,2.9329,5.9185,2.7435,3.9062,0.1146,5.0617,3.2899,3.4542,0.0387,5.758,1.6975,5.5488,4.2817,0.0017,3.5973,3.1009,0.8976,1.7768,2.5693,4.8096,1.3073,5.1667,0.2519,3.2888,3.846,2.6334,3.1509,0.8482,0.7922,6.107,0.2637,2.2318,0.4715,1.1246,4.8719,2.2471,5.7645,1.5632,1.1947,1.8898,2.3442,5.8003,4.7304,0.0259,2.1831,3.2395,2.411,5.5329,0.4479,2.6062,0.3614,0.044,2.255,4.735,2.5157,2.6672,3.3769,2.5877,2.4574,2.7788,6.004,0.5838,0.9558,5.2805,2.3991,0.6308,4.7177,1.6995,0.6447,1.5993,2.4636,0.1711,7.0795,2.7005,5.0879,0.4051,5.5118,1.8267,2.2514,0.9931,1.0738,4.0525,0.7643,2.3096,4.5624,0.4959,1.9573,4.8912,4.5765,3.1853,1.0548,1.2699,2.8098,4.1284,1.9348,2.9246,1.9121,0.0769,0.0019,1.2638,0.705,4.4591,5.4462,0.1056,2.1137,4.5396,0.057,4.5634,1.02,1.0392,3.9357,0.2771,0.1483,1.8079,1.6033,5.158,1.7913,5.7478,2.6167,6.8484,5.4378,1.6053,2.3144,1.3345,3.3251,1.77,4.5999,5.6807,1.8905,3.2558,0.4244,4.4795,7.0169,1.2093,3.7217,2.6692,2.0705,0.5219,3.8732,6.974,2.768,1.8775,4.0022,0.954,3.6602,0.0334,5.5652,4.1428,4.3376,1.8411,0.0024,3.1993,2.5175,1.6341,2.6996,2.945,2.8165,4.1746,1.5582,0.0014,2.3298,4.9353,5.5888,2.3686,1.787,3.3486,0.9654,2.1325,2.6841,4.4061,3.3006,1.5466,2.0459,4.8032,1.2052,5.109,1.7109,0.2675,5.1731,2.1384,1.2833,2.832,2.455,3.5809,0.2835,5.6759,3.7922,1.39,1.4412,0.0322,3.4891,5.9631,2.2437,2.9198,0.9538,4.2327,1.5814,4.5899,1.2635,5.1085,1.6383,2.7571,4.9031,1.6299,5.3437,2.4482,5.7235,4.5711,5.8958,3.5036,4.7609,5.1188,2.8604,2.0724,0.6638,1.4048,2.8744,4.653,1.7865,3.144,5.3748,1.0588,4.2688,1.1028,5.4256,2.9333,5.1056,0.0335,0.9412,0.0076,3.92,2.529,2.4367,2.584,0.6787,4.9172,5.3828,2.4241,1.1669,1.32,2.3548,0.0005,2.3,2.6468,2.4266,5.0507,2.4853,5.3021,5.111,1.1555,1.4391,5.1199,0.0813,3.9554,5.6741,3.1535,3.1296,0.0242,0.0005,0.2486,4.8365,5.3528,0.0604,4.8838,3.4723,4.6952,4.5671,0.1068,1.5519,3.5622,0.6384,2.7081,0.1731,0.9447,2.0027,3.1695,0.3042,2.3597,3.1953,2.0752,3.2395,3.1757,0.1888,5.1761,1.4042,3.9903,2.061,2.6644,4.3117,3.2473,0.5679,0.0006,0.0008,0.0432,1.4464,2.642,4.7203,1.5941,3.6422,1.8094,1.2227,1.9993,5.5503,3.7036,4.7341,4.1637,3.5112,1.1818,5.5539,4.8814,1.9832,5.7904,5.3032,2.2011,0.7568,5.151,1.3046,5.6273,1.9087,3.8043,5.4319,1.7853,4.7423,1.6371,4.2167,0.0086,2.1844,3.1855,0.0028,2.5761,1.8276,4.4823,0.1661,3.1099,4.1457,2.2853,1.9984,1.5248,0.9982,4.0328,0.7309,2.0021,1.2603,1.8784,5.578,1.5993,6.3249,0.6542,0.9585,4.7515,5.7471,2.2759,5.0483,1.9012,4.4495,3.6573,2.5822,4.7217,5.7376,5.181,2.1233,1.5631,1.1256,3.935,5.575,2.51,5.1777,1.6692,2.494,1.3295,1.4374,2.3193,5.2744,2.7262,4.5525,3.1438,6.2353,0.6982,0.0008,2.1687,2.766,4.4918,0.3366,4.2592,4.586,3.0518,0.0051,0.39,0.0007,1.7951,0.0008,0.0527,0.006,0.0146,0.3438,0.0015,5.0909,0.6397,0.1148,4.4573,0.0064,2.4302,0.0008,3.5832,0.0004,3.2359,0.0744,4.8523,0.0091,1.5542,0.5593,0.0293,5.0636,3.1282,1.3344]}

The story of his disappearance was completely fabricated, his disappearance is widely shared, and he did not leave any money to the 'em'. He had probably not even known that he might be missing, and he would make up his own story later on after coming to terms with the fact he had no information on his disappearance, and this is where I begin to give my opinion.'\n\nHe was interviewed after being released by police with two other suspects: one was James A. McAfee, who knew nothing of Mr Newbery's activities, with a police application for extradition which Mr Mowbray later accepted. As a result of the interview, Mr Newbery returned to the UK with Mr McAfee and told police that he had found Mr Newbery and the woman he had met with on his way to an airport.\n\nWhat follows is a summary of all of his alleged criminal activities.\n\nThe police interview was not in any way conducted and Mr A. McAfee had not been interviewed, however, when asked about his involvement in the case. Mr McAfee declined to comment where this might lead. His daughter, who was also interviewed (with the assistance of a former British intelligence agent named James M. Ritchie), said the relationship between him and Mr McAfee is not very strong and that they remained in touch during most of his time with Mr Newbery. They also said they had met with Mr McAfee \"as part of our research into Mr Newbery\".\n\nJames McAfee went to Thailand in February 1995 and bought a house and was living in Bangkok at the time of his disappearance. He worked for the company 'Trackspotting' as a consultant on the electronic payment system. He also worked on various businesses including advertising advertising on television, the internet and other computer products. The company was working on the electronic payment system with the help of the intelligence agency, the Security Services Agency. The CIA did not want to risk their own security after the theft of financial information from the company's parent company, The SysSecs.\n\nAfter his arrest on 28 May 1995, Mr McAfee was extradited to Thailand for questioning. He was granted bail at 4 November 1995 and moved to Dublin, where the trial had begun on 6 October 1995.\n\nIn October 1995, Mr McAfee was placed in administrative detention. This was held in Dublin until 8 November 1995 for interrogation in the detention yard of the Northern Ireland Embassy in Washington D.C.

{"id":252,"ended":false,"length":499,"gen_text":"The rioting was sparked by allegations of sexual assault on Han women by Uyghurs, and rumours of an incident in which two female Han workers were sexually assaulted by six Uyghur co @ -and- uyghurs. According to sources, the women alleged that the men had beaten them when they were teenagers and then brutally raped them when the cops arrived. The men have been charged with rape of a police officer on charges that include rape of a person under age ten.Uyghur women are also demanding an enquiry on the incident, and the government has threatened that if it feels that such allegations have already been made against Uyghur workers then it shall immediately initiate an independent investigation. The rioting started on 9th October, when a mob of Han men was pelted with stones and molotov cocktails by Uyghurs, who carried out the attack. The Uyghurs demanded that the villagers take them to a police station to face some sort of investigation, after which they were left to themselves to go to a temple and pray.\n\nHan woman says some of the men raped her by Uyghurs https:\/\/t.co\/YtBwBqgGKV pic.twitter.com\/iJfBkqxqEo \u2014 The Daily News (@DailyNews) October 14, 2017\n\nWhat's the matter with @UyghurWorship? They say we will not be doing this and they will always punish those who don't take us at our word. \u2014 Bhajat Ung Bhaal (@BhajatUng) October 14, 2017\n\n\nUyghur women also said that if the government, and the media, would not take action on this so-called 'women's war' they would be able to arrest uyghurs who were in support of uxor.\n\nThe women say they are being targeted for their alleged offences under the rape of Han women by men. \"Hindi men have been calling for women to boycott uyghurs, and their representatives have refused to take action,\" one woman said.According to sources, the rioting began after two men barged into three women's homes and threw a rock at them. The women rushed to safety, but one of them tried to grab a rock. As the policemen arrived, the thugs shouted \"we will not let you break a female's throat,\" while another man came to protect the women, who were shouting \"hail the heroes!\"\n\nThe woman's wife, who also wants a police investigation into the case, said that the men then took her to a temple, held her and two Uyghur girls to ransom money for their release. She told The Daily News: \"I saw blood everywhere, they would not allow that to happen to them.\" The Uyghurs had asked for compensation of some Rs 30,000 to the woman, the women told The Daily News","token_len":610,"entropy":[10.9224,2.384,2.5817,2.5201,0.3063,4.7793,0.9544,3.2141,1.0054,3.5679,10.6974,12.2558,2.3869,7.0247,3.9198,0.2676,0.9863,1.596,2.825,7.9742,0.8681,3.8263,4.2734,1.9469,0.4339,3.3009,4.4651,3.8146,4.8079,0.4599,3.4037,0.1808,1.1333,6.7498,4.199,0.0084,0.0004,2.8175,8.6017,16.6185,9.9517,5.7919,3.3784,4.4105,1.3849,0.1176,0.5205,0.7883,5.7987,0.0029,3.9173,0.5581,1.2819,3.0095,4.2918,0.5481,1.5329,1.5134,2.199,4.6206,0.5717,5.0336,0.1475,1.2469,5.6136,1.1531,2.2456,5.73,0.7885,0.1223,3.4278,5.002,5.976,1.2938,0.4986,1.9303,2.8131,3.1544,1.0327,2.1341,0.3187,1.2759,2.5253,1.1095,4.8078,0.1859,4.2109,2.8517,3.3954,1.8577,1.039,1.0338,0.2604,4.6575,0.3466,2.5289,5.336,0.8557,5.8676,0.0718,0.0022,0.6798,1.6648,2.3457,2.3378,3.6132,2.2398,5.4561,0.0015,4.5729,0.5213,2.5692,1.8015,1.3621,1.8613,3.2272,0.8055,5.0161,4.3397,2.8148,2.663,5.9881,1.3541,3.4453,2.7323,2.4884,5.7619,0.1301,0.7085,1.6191,2.1142,0.0234,0.001,0.6591,2.7106,3.9644,0.9219,5.4502,3.528,3.4423,0.8052,4.4727,0.7628,0.6067,2.8383,2.9618,0.3715,3.3429,1.5233,4.7941,1.8513,2.5721,1.5803,1.1839,2.0546,2.9537,0.4477,2.3503,1.7509,3.7676,3.137,0.0792,0.0558,0.2448,1.0415,4.7068,0.3132,0.001,0.0672,1.4713,2.1968,0.01,0.0013,0.7305,2.1587,1.4378,5.7605,0.8329,1.4919,1.3432,0.7467,1.7323,2.9464,0.0243,0.0015,0.8164,5.9083,1.2198,0.6438,5.7231,2.8724,4.5605,0.7458,2.5475,1.2693,0.0268,2.3709,2.302,5.6695,2.4499,0.0007,2.3017,1.8356,4.5466,0.2049,1.0939,1.2212,4.597,1.6322,5.0212,3.1359,4.6992,1.2725,2.1738,5.7371,2.1908,1.5789,0.7866,4.832,0.0014,4.6991,4.4624,2.9112,6.4033,1.5458,0.935,1.8133,3.545,0.1408,3.0912,1.4605,0.0123,0.0027,0.3845,3.3483,0.0006,0.0056,0.0006,0.0001,0.0011,4.1863,4.0869,4.0724,3.7077,4.5792,3.5097,4.4487,4.2841,4.5607,3.9676,0.9938,0.0004,0.0,0.0005,0.0004,0.0004,4.5574,3.587,4.151,4.5395,3.6332,3.9077,4.3259,3.9531,4.235,3.3538,0.0887,3.0104,2.2149,4.1211,0.147,1.1386,0.0342,0.0686,0.5292,3.2877,0.0003,1.0521,0.2922,0.0002,5.8336,2.5735,2.3529,4.2172,0.3868,4.6805,2.9571,0.177,0.0448,0.4275,4.5761,2.7127,1.2884,2.5076,3.6649,3.9976,3.9945,1.7413,1.5827,5.4631,2.4603,4.6514,2.2505,1.4454,5.8004,5.107,3.9589,0.26,3.2853,0.0031,4.3101,1.9836,5.3871,0.2528,0.0117,0.6997,2.0951,6.1382,4.7637,4.1187,10.2199,7.3344,3.9746,3.068,0.3419,1.0131,0.9238,0.034,0.0556,2.4523,0.5041,2.1774,0.0035,0.1939,0.0012,0.0019,3.9384,0.0003,2.8394,0.039,0.0042,0.5961,1.5232,4.0785,3.0054,0.5878,4.7342,1.0777,2.1275,5.4088,3.2176,1.0955,2.879,0.8591,3.8518,1.321,2.1079,1.193,2.3617,2.3381,5.8412,0.5365,0.0027,2.5479,5.6361,0.3627,3.5059,0.6895,2.724,0.4296,2.262,4.395,0.0206,5.4565,5.2209,0.1225,0.0049,0.3809,2.4413,2.6156,3.9181,3.6437,0.0595,3.9809,5.9711,2.6051,1.413,1.2823,0.0002,2.6919,3.4424,3.6154,1.8017,1.605,3.2931,3.031,1.9234,0.856,2.9211,5.3558,4.4576,0.7945,5.5513,1.1483,1.8852,0.3662,1.4411,3.2523,1.3986,2.4918,5.8404,1.433,1.1728,3.1103,2.1266,2.2266,5.8607,1.3831,3.3813,1.1792,4.9088,2.1707,0.0942,0.0044,0.689,2.4978,1.9026,4.7317,5.8463,0.9469,4.1715,0.1796,1.967,0.9237,1.8532,2.6337,1.5945,1.1015,0.3175,6.3142,0.0027,2.2874,0.1443,0.9275,2.2986,0.1017,1.8288,1.9246,3.4692,3.2055,5.5757,0.024,0.2441,6.8856,2.7972,0.246,1.1169,1.3715,3.2928,3.422,3.4534,0.4568,0.4239,0.6924,1.3382,1.2988,4.5474,0.4188,2.2309,1.2429,0.568,2.683,0.3241,0.9859,4.8085,0.032,3.2154,1.3243,3.5119,2.8964,3.9283,1.0239,4.8389,1.8527,0.5496,1.351,6.2799,4.2556,1.9819,4.6554,1.5755,0.9077,2.1796,0.6843,4.1456,4.7372,5.6674,0.5434,4.0789,2.8153,3.3117,2.427,1.8425,4.7874,1.8008,4.9022,1.3524,0.9194,2.5011,2.1367,0.9162,4.5228,0.6115,5.1112,3.1391,2.6022,5.7557,2.0606,2.4271,0.0002,2.4742,3.001,3.071,5.8515,1.9665,1.1077,3.8357,4.8778,2.7956,3.0467,0.9689,1.1757,0.2682,3.0643,0.1143,1.1113,1.212,1.3853,2.1167,4.8707,3.2371,0.4397,0.442,0.7608,2.4427,1.9473,6.38,0.3408,1.9897,5.2335,3.8714,0.008,0.0023,1.1101,4.0152,2.3332,1.86,3.0493,2.9553,1.4459,1.2996,0.4639,2.2162,3.1254,1.218,0.5975,0.0414,2.0955,0.1369,1.8079,3.6091,6.0498,1.6996,1.32,3.4741,4.1958,2.9126,2.4884,4.6879,0.8041,0.245,1.5089,2.3469,1.8796,2.7266,2.8381,0.0111,0.0019,0.5427,3.4095,4.251,1.4803,4.1373,2.0405,3.6995,0.9181,3.7766,0.5925,0.0099,2.2888,1.6601,2.4669,1.3675,3.939,2.5944,3.2231,0.2904,0.0862,0.0027]}
{"id":4209,"ended":true,"length":562,"gen_text":"Opened on April 1, 1936, the U @ - @ Drop Inn was built by J.M. Tindall using a design created by his friend, John Nunn, who scratched the design for the U @ - @ Drop Inn to make it look like the barcode plate would be seen in the front section of the U @ - @ Drop Inn, and to accommodate several rows of two-inch long glass bars on the sides.\nWith this simple design of the U @ - @ Drop Inn, the U @ - @ Drop Inn was able to be put to good use and it became the standard in the industry. The U & C @ - @ Drop Inn were opened in 1938 and were closed to the public because they were considered unsafe for public restroom facilities, with barcodes being posted at entrances to any restroom or shower stall. The U @ - @ Drop Inn was a great addition in the industry as it allowed use of an easy to follow instruction that required the reader to check and understand the correct barcode on the front side of the U & C @ - @ Drop Inn, so many of the barcodes remained undetected. It was the introduction of the U Lounge and the subsequent installation of glass and glass curtains that were considered acceptable for drinking.\nAfter the Second World War, the U & C @ Drop Inn closed its doors. When closing, the doors were painted with the U Drop Inn logo on the windows. However, after the U @ - @ Drop Inn fell into disrepair, the U & C @ Drop Inn remained in business and was put on hold by the Wrens.\nThe U Drop Inn was the only barcode-equipped bar in the industry when the Wrens changed the layout, and only after the Wrens bought up the barcodes. It was also the only time at U @ - @ Drop Inn where the U drop in used barcodes didn't appear to do any harm.\nIn January 1939, U & C @ @ Drop Inn reopened as the Wrens. The barcodes were taken from the Wrens when it was replaced by a glass window, for which the original barcode was used; at some point in the future when one of the owners of the bar decided it did not hold a barcode, the Wrens changed the original barcode to be a bit thicker and put a glass bar code in it instead of the glass that had been used previously. The owner of the U Drop Inn, Gary Doolittle (who died in 1939 aged 86), had the entire barcode printed and it was kept in the Wrens until his death in 1937. Many of the barcodes are still visible on the window that was used when U @ - @ Drop Inn opened at Wrens.\nU @ - @ Drop Inn closed its remaining hours in September 1941, so that there was enough time to reopens at least one more time (if not all, at least one extra hour before they opened at Wrens).","token_len":611,"entropy":[9.2297,2.8785,3.3558,2.4594,0.3664,6.7265,1.0303,1.4511,5.0603,15.6486,6.1768,4.5951,10.6981,8.4004,2.2619,3.7139,1.7606,4.6104,0.5687,4.0691,0.0749,5.4575,6.228,1.1513,7.3077,2.3122,4.2445,5.1234,0.4076,4.2358,1.8849,1.5857,3.2918,5.3309,4.8291,1.5931,1.6224,12.5035,1.2322,3.6647,2.5187,0.8533,2.7617,1.5154,0.722,0.0741,0.6642,0.1179,4.1555,1.8314,0.6093,1.3938,1.1616,1.5593,4.6346,3.9811,5.4272,3.6162,1.1561,5.1703,1.76,0.8753,3.3882,6.2969,0.7384,0.248,3.3616,1.3105,0.2187,0.0142,0.3776,0.0089,3.1888,2.6325,3.4991,5.0777,5.9418,6.3097,0.1787,4.9097,1.3732,4.2821,4.0908,4.9145,4.464,3.4717,0.7656,3.3168,0.8289,1.6033,9.7207,2.884,6.025,0.5748,4.5983,0.3931,0.6538,0.1351,0.0304,0.0034,0.0301,0.0005,0.4675,1.1974,1.6981,0.2701,0.2123,0.0038,0.0673,0.0017,2.1722,2.3857,0.0039,3.0769,4.9146,1.8698,1.7733,0.0135,2.6201,3.9853,2.5533,1.5286,2.2255,2.9585,1.5921,4.3213,0.7213,1.993,0.9908,5.6392,3.735,2.5129,0.6298,0.0331,0.067,0.0046,4.2796,5.6271,0.9581,3.8114,1.1503,1.9088,4.0521,3.1379,0.8114,0.0907,5.5011,1.8258,0.8151,3.162,1.7841,2.2502,3.9537,6.7236,4.5742,2.9449,4.3918,6.3931,1.5334,2.065,4.7285,2.2782,1.8144,1.8184,5.0392,2.5644,3.5202,4.8842,3.0676,0.6136,1.7246,0.7141,0.8825,0.0246,0.0046,0.0136,0.0006,1.2669,3.5418,3.5995,2.29,4.9434,0.8479,3.4648,1.9292,0.8411,1.6791,5.8799,0.1649,4.9092,5.0068,0.5922,3.9592,5.4655,3.085,3.8942,2.4736,3.7658,0.1785,4.6183,4.2322,3.7099,0.5984,4.617,1.2155,0.4333,2.6759,0.9442,3.4489,3.6597,0.3378,0.1444,0.4495,1.8278,0.0458,0.7958,0.1694,0.0042,0.0295,0.0006,2.0757,4.1766,5.038,2.5442,0.8389,2.5347,0.4781,5.696,5.5558,0.3499,0.9582,3.6271,0.8328,2.5808,5.9847,0.1104,0.9574,1.3907,6.7984,3.0907,1.1272,5.6189,4.9095,0.0571,5.6734,3.5461,2.3908,5.7485,1.7498,3.4288,4.0768,5.3287,2.3316,4.719,1.5933,0.9137,4.0404,1.0558,5.7791,0.0104,0.0013,0.435,0.8254,0.2625,2.377,0.117,0.2407,2.8883,0.0033,2.1015,2.0498,0.0378,3.4799,4.7002,6.5052,1.1399,0.8939,3.6319,1.002,5.1817,1.9268,1.4763,1.5439,4.9817,0.0883,0.8247,1.9466,0.5571,4.0807,1.2678,4.32,0.0405,3.0422,1.1039,2.7036,1.6822,0.1335,0.0038,0.0165,0.0009,7.37,0.9649,0.1781,0.0537,0.5181,0.8519,0.9137,1.6577,0.0513,0.1116,0.2964,0.0012,3.1968,2.4877,0.6812,2.2352,1.8667,5.0706,2.1671,2.9428,2.6493,0.677,5.7603,5.5608,1.4732,2.022,1.7102,1.5231,0.6721,2.3389,0.0035,1.4436,3.3495,1.8049,1.0009,1.6868,3.2073,3.6984,0.3257,0.9337,0.854,3.1297,4.0928,1.3861,1.7931,0.0155,0.1042,5.1171,1.0186,3.1603,3.7127,1.904,4.7409,3.1676,1.0941,1.1178,0.0171,0.0758,4.3078,3.9694,0.6512,2.5757,1.6087,1.5849,3.4933,0.7383,2.7726,0.715,0.2411,6.3536,5.7417,4.3134,2.052,0.2295,0.0068,0.0363,0.0053,1.9183,0.8132,1.3013,4.6581,2.2121,5.0831,2.6378,0.4066,5.6026,0.0017,1.8263,2.3058,6.4088,1.4875,2.1368,0.9883,0.9794,2.9183,5.0845,2.809,0.2234,4.179,1.4048,0.1259,0.0908,3.3004,0.0596,0.0156,3.4752,2.3934,0.7618,2.0347,0.0293,0.1777,4.252,1.5178,2.8161,1.6872,1.0207,4.7622,1.8927,0.4702,1.584,0.0116,0.1123,4.1317,2.8566,0.747,5.3443,0.6241,1.7698,2.7789,4.693,2.5597,6.0648,3.0288,0.8697,4.6723,2.3402,0.719,1.2236,4.2912,6.6445,4.9726,3.9591,0.1157,1.9161,0.8152,2.3152,4.6996,5.9756,1.2398,0.1472,5.848,1.3867,0.1545,1.5628,4.8317,3.0347,4.0702,0.125,5.6258,2.2282,0.9655,0.4591,0.5482,0.7681,1.1905,0.0147,0.1094,3.3389,0.384,5.1119,0.8406,0.1501,0.8354,4.0284,1.7219,5.5777,3.6321,1.3545,4.7114,1.593,2.0007,2.3758,2.0695,2.3055,2.6377,3.4783,2.1528,1.0406,1.831,3.6522,2.3585,0.3447,1.1599,3.041,0.2209,1.7863,6.4261,0.9386,0.1294,2.516,0.3625,0.0143,2.3649,5.5833,4.3812,5.7303,0.3623,3.8603,1.5401,3.3319,0.3178,3.9653,5.3997,3.594,0.328,2.915,2.9983,5.8719,0.6637,0.6135,5.0259,3.5929,4.2487,0.6085,4.683,0.905,1.5553,1.1188,0.0099,0.1741,2.4477,3.1071,0.2296,0.6568,4.6728,0.3097,6.2432,1.1595,0.0882,1.5743,0.2855,3.033,0.9534,2.931,1.0918,0.2945,2.4946,3.8731,1.9439,0.8892,3.3747,2.9371,0.833,0.0087,0.0051,0.0158,0.0061,0.9386,4.4091,3.6564,0.0296,0.095,1.3058,0.5327,3.4819,1.8208,0.2287,0.0043,0.0497,0.0056,1.9212,2.1509,9.3473,4.1284,2.1105,3.0603,2.5528,1.6085,4.1022,1.5208,3.9611,1.7281,4.2302,0.4083,0.8493,4.5436,5.2116,3.3205,2.7029,2.5573,0.986,0.0692,4.1983,4.4822,0.3441,1.9907,2.5371,3.4063,0.2178,0.6617,5.5108,1.5742,4.3872,4.3381,2.5508,2.5832,1.143,0.0024,0.0145,0.5306]}
{"id":1136,"ended":true,"length":547,"gen_text":"Immediately after Per\u00f3n's death, the government suspended all official activities for two days and ordered all flags flown at half @ - @ staff for ten days. It soon became apparent, however, that the presence of the president's brother and the vice president of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were responsible for the failure to carry out the security tasks.\n\nThis latest violation is an attempt to silence the international community and the international community should not feel afraid to discuss any possible sanctions. The situation on the ground is different because of the efforts of Per\u00f3n, but also because the new administration has taken into account the needs of the international community.\n\nIn the US, the White House on Monday said it has received \"deep concerns with respect to the fact that Trump's proposed sanctions against Russia do threaten Iran's strategic interests and interests in the region\".\n\nU.S. officials have also received information that Trump's new administration is considering sanctions against Russia, despite what they called its previous statements to the contrary.\n\nU.S. officials have made some of the key statements against Iran in their statements to the media in recent years, and on several occasions, Washington has issued new sanctions, like last week's announcement against the United Arab Emirates.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump recently announced that all U.S. citizens (and visitors) must now travel to Syria under the current regime. U.S. officials have also said that no Russian diplomats were involved in any of the activities planned by the former president, even though U.S. officials recently revealed that Russian state security services were able to collect intelligence on former Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nThis comes after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has repeatedly reiterated his determination to avoid a repeat of the sanctions that helped him win his U.S. elections in 2009.\n\nRussia's decision to ban imports of Russian poultry, poultry products, meats and fish prompted U.S. officials to believe the Russian authorities were using Moscow as a bargaining chip.\n\nAs it pertains to the new administration, some U.S. leaders have offered to work together with Russia over their own agenda. Some are meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at the G20 summit and several of them are visiting Moscow.\n\nSome politicians, officials and journalists are in Russia for dinner. Their country is one of the first countries to accept a U.S. policy on the world stage after it was established to protect the country against terrorists.\n\nHowever, the United States is not yet ready to officially recognize Russia as a new geopolitical power because, according to sources familiar with the situation, Russian president Vladimir Putin is not planning to back U.S.-led sanctions. Moscow considers U.S. sanctions a very political and provocative move, and could become even more aggressive if Trump's action puts them at odds with Russia.\n\nIt is unclear how far these sanctions would fall once they have achieved the goals, but that's about to change.","token_len":611,"entropy":[9.8109,0.7541,10.4689,6.913,1.0046,2.741,0.2569,1.7632,3.7239,5.8676,2.6376,4.0293,3.6209,3.4676,2.542,1.3228,2.142,2.6559,1.7135,8.2975,2.3453,0.6704,1.4079,16.3209,9.4327,5.817,11.1031,4.8694,7.0403,0.8195,0.5996,4.1348,7.1957,0.8919,1.8713,4.4636,0.4943,0.0055,0.0322,1.1967,5.9079,0.0505,1.4385,4.5161,1.4254,5.8466,2.3784,2.2721,3.3286,0.3548,2.0784,0.587,4.44,1.8503,0.0783,0.0049,0.5525,0.0037,0.0001,0.6364,0.0012,0.0,0.2912,1.7963,4.9584,0.1591,0.6336,4.5138,1.2934,3.8285,0.0237,0.9479,3.8669,5.402,1.2539,1.1252,0.0019,4.1275,5.6789,4.8913,3.1535,3.1884,2.4761,0.5378,4.3173,0.954,3.7722,0.2844,1.6954,1.9704,2.2282,0.627,3.3128,2.0227,5.0884,4.355,0.7286,5.3392,4.4686,3.0129,4.3329,2.3935,2.1101,4.1534,4.3982,0.1838,0.2748,1.0533,5.1038,4.1131,1.4488,0.4822,5.7202,0.3994,4.5116,0.0199,2.3783,3.3015,1.7312,0.1753,1.951,5.8634,1.6217,1.6045,3.6545,4.5294,0.2447,0.5419,3.8532,0.1554,0.5426,1.806,0.0131,0.9545,1.1288,0.0002,2.9933,1.7394,5.4603,0.4629,1.3653,4.0416,0.0011,5.6035,1.7997,2.6992,1.417,3.1673,3.4352,2.424,4.554,1.6582,6.0712,0.9926,0.0199,0.6508,4.9184,0.071,5.5234,1.1008,4.8327,1.7264,2.3819,0.5116,4.6574,8.9922,5.9347,0.6143,4.6534,0.9178,1.3977,3.5142,0.4637,0.3887,0.3082,2.6232,0.7978,0.0002,5.5368,0.2189,0.0549,0.0653,2.1304,1.7029,2.3286,5.4336,4.1663,0.7383,3.1486,1.2087,3.4977,1.0885,1.308,1.6976,2.7796,0.7825,0.904,1.6074,5.3821,4.7275,2.3165,4.2461,4.5368,4.4041,2.7732,3.2993,0.213,0.0194,0.2033,0.6045,0.0002,3.1861,0.0038,0.0251,0.0434,1.2482,1.0302,5.3195,4.8947,2.7764,0.5249,5.6224,1.4203,4.1224,2.9828,1.7371,2.9796,2.3653,1.0744,0.4734,3.1505,3.0186,1.1563,4.6435,1.0892,2.2754,4.3239,4.4624,0.0148,1.652,5.8444,0.3162,4.6489,3.6638,0.7884,3.5917,5.225,5.0992,1.0149,0.3967,3.3893,3.1188,1.9251,3.9533,2.0473,0.0021,1.5167,0.4215,0.0002,2.7896,0.0019,0.007,0.0348,2.5858,0.4014,0.0112,5.7845,2.9143,1.05,4.9736,1.8129,0.0007,0.0048,0.0554,2.6204,5.641,2.658,4.3662,0.5414,2.3329,4.8192,3.5419,0.3675,2.9249,4.1604,1.1067,4.5452,1.4172,1.9318,3.9876,0.0012,0.0035,0.0197,1.5657,0.9499,1.1702,1.8457,0.4513,4.4784,5.0075,3.4764,3.6715,4.1247,0.1041,2.0718,1.4993,0.2178,3.2138,5.314,1.1949,0.5102,4.8528,1.7206,2.1659,3.6599,0.2382,3.459,0.0006,0.0023,0.0246,1.0954,5.3483,3.9401,0.3623,1.9324,3.9521,4.7674,1.3225,1.7228,5.8767,0.0084,5.0399,2.6986,0.5604,5.2416,3.1106,0.3137,0.1007,1.3075,0.811,0.3539,0.0002,4.0817,4.5266,1.3038,3.4697,1.6721,0.1342,0.5386,0.0,3.4159,3.9498,4.4637,1.4494,4.9945,0.1945,4.4889,2.33,2.3602,0.0093,0.5234,4.3953,2.1932,6.1193,2.9859,1.5217,3.8924,5.7718,0.001,0.0534,0.0802,4.2743,0.8331,5.1874,0.5693,0.7102,0.0002,3.1189,1.3224,4.2792,0.2676,3.4295,5.2358,0.2194,1.8703,6.0286,2.2639,2.3621,0.5175,1.2055,5.2396,0.664,2.5309,5.8479,2.7976,0.0005,0.0058,0.028,1.1259,0.1544,5.1711,3.0916,2.7307,3.4775,1.2266,3.7792,5.9414,1.2281,0.3902,2.8957,0.0254,1.7823,0.8709,0.0002,4.4168,4.3022,5.1339,0.0245,0.0085,1.0982,3.9033,1.4851,0.635,4.8373,1.7091,0.0008,0.0035,0.0166,5.8781,1.0453,5.9003,1.1505,3.6007,2.0504,1.6017,1.5558,4.713,4.6814,3.9461,5.2826,1.346,4.0752,4.0255,5.6944,0.6914,1.6875,1.6798,0.0274,0.8904,0.0001,2.6321,0.5608,2.5478,0.3503,0.4079,3.8142,4.9857,2.6461,0.6146,1.2337,3.6899,1.75,1.4204,0.5103,0.0003,3.8327,6.0093,2.3613,5.595,0.3941,2.836,2.124,4.3255,2.8209,1.6744,5.1487,1.8911,5.8894,5.4524,1.178,3.3416,0.0446,0.3808,4.1568,1.0748,0.7511,4.4235,3.0862,1.6208,0.0005,0.0606,0.5077,4.4846,2.5076,2.2175,4.154,0.0182,4.311,3.9964,1.1425,2.2957,4.7953,3.0106,1.2975,3.1929,2.1139,5.1808,0.7388,0.7007,0.0003,4.1588,0.0333,1.8419,2.9754,0.0427,1.7621,1.079,3.9656,1.757,0.1222,4.3561,1.9505,0.935,0.5548,0.3282,6.1129,5.6184,0.6953,4.4951,3.9533,1.8107,0.0012,6.0862,3.1756,0.0034,0.4805,0.6347,0.1773,4.55,4.2506,0.0601,0.0046,1.9669,1.4188,4.3265,0.3908,5.4399,4.663,0.0004,0.0036,1.6052,1.9925,1.0416,1.2227,5.2939,4.2422,2.8859,0.0004,0.0018,0.3351,0.7253,2.3079,5.1755,5.044,2.0744,4.2497,1.1178,1.738,1.0049,5.0653,4.836,2.2381,0.0998,2.2548,1.1378,2.7343,2.1654,5.3677,5.8547,5.0174,0.7596,0.8885,0.0866,1.959,0.7585,0.3402,0.0002,4.3332,0.5284,2.8115,1.8835,4.0698,3.1583,2.3408,2.7578,4.746,4.9454,1.372,2.055,6.5416,3.077,4.9499,4.5849,0.6028,4.6912,3.3462,5.3945,1.0305,0.0666,0.2738]}
{"id":4081,"ended":true,"length":564,"gen_text":"On June 3, precautionary alerts were raised across the southern Baja California Peninsula and much of Western Mexico, due to potential impacts from the hurricane. Two days later, the Government of Florida issued three warnings that are currently effective to those affected, with the fourth being implemented today because of the storm. In the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, the Department of Agriculture has issued several precautionary alerts as of today but there have thus far been no additional alerts due to the threat of Hurricane Irma impacting the entire area.\n\nHurricane Irma is expected to have damaging winds of at least 5-10 mph (12-18 kilometers\/h) along the western coast of Florida, with more powerful storms coming from the Caribbean and North Atlantic. Some areas could see as high as 15-25 mph winds, which is expected to hit south of the South Florida coast, along the eastern coast of the coast and the coast of the Gulf Coast, and even north of the northern coastal plains of South Florida and Louisiana. Irma will be very, very dangerous in the north and east north Bahamas.\n\nHurricane Irma has already affected nearly 40,000 homes in Southern California and in the Southern Ocean and continues to disrupt the entire coast on a daily basis with winds hovering between 50 miles and 100 miles (115 km) per hour (40 to 40 km\/h). Irma has displaced 5,000 people from their homes and is projected to impact areas north of Lake Tahoe, where it has devastated 3 million people. Hurricane Irma is believed to cause the biggest displacement in the United States.\n\nIn the Florida Keys, the Department of Agriculture reports that an additional 7,250 people are due to arrive on Monday, the very day before Irma passes, including 15,000 children under 6 years of age, and 2,500 women and children with disabilities at risk of a life-threatening injury. The Department anticipates that as of this evening, the hurricane may remain extremely powerful for a considerable amount of time. A large portion of Florida will likely be without power during the weekend. There is little time to monitor the storm's progress due to the low tides that will impact the southeastern Gulf coastline. During landfall, it is likely that storm water will enter the United States from Mexico.\n\nHurricane Irma will affect portions of North America including the Caribbean, Puerto Rico, and the Gulf Coast. The extent of the damage is relatively small. The National Hurricane Center and Hurricane Center for Texas have said that severe damage to homes and structures in the southeast Atlantic province over the weekend will be minimal.\n\nOther information, such as location, direction, and conditions for this information will be shared with the National Weather Service on a daily basis as they develop.

Black bear ( Broom snake ) has the largest range of red-tail, white, pink, or brown snakewood and is endemic in deserts and hot deserts. The main variety of these snakes is brown and black with similar names associated with several species of snakes. Black bears in temperate deserts have more green snake trees, more brown snakes that tend to emerge larger in wet and hot-season areas, and less red-tail (and blue-like, and gray-tail snakes) in wet conditions. The red snake in this range is very common at the beginning of the winter and in very warm-season environments. Unlike other snakes with large populations, blue-tail snakes are often found growing in cooler temperatures; for this reason, the most common blue-tail species in this range are the black bear with short, flat leaves, and yellow leaves, as well as the graybear ( < bax, lacerator, leucothea).\n\nBibliography\n\nHochschild LJ (1949). \"The evolutionary history of common snakes.\" Animal Behaviour 22 744-751. http:\/\/www.hochschild.com\/pet-life_studies\/species\/Common-Sharks-Behavior\/Skeletal-Species.html\n\nHochschild LJ.

{"id":3015,"ended":false,"length":579,"gen_text":"Myriostoma coliforme is a distinctive species easily characterized by its size \u2014 being the largest earthstar fungus \u2014 as well as the multiple openings on its spore sack and stalk supporting the sack. Historically, the entire Earth was in the center of earth and therefore many scientists believed there was nowhere around Earth other than the south pole. But there was no trace of the earth to humans anywhere near it until early 1800s. The discovery of this unique mushroom has become known as the discovery of the first Earth. The discovery of this unique mushroom is a discovery that could have significant implications for human science and it could influence the development of new technologies, such as space probes. On the other hand, the discovery of this unique mushroom would also open space on a new way to study the environment with a much greater knowledge of the human complex: the ocean. This discovery could provide the first complete example of a marine life with a living atmosphere like this.\n\nThis mushroom can be considered to be from a single species of sea turtle. In fact, several species of earthstar fungus have been identified, such as the Sea Sea Scorpion. Sea turtle genera have evolved to live in a world of abundance in which there is no food for many small organisms. These organisms are found mostly inland in the United States (including most of Canada), South Korea, Japan, and Australia. When freshwater fish, which lack the oxygen in the ocean, may be consumed by the sea turtle, they are often forced to go farther and deeper to find food. Once on land the Sea Sea Scorpion makes two main sources of sustenance for fish. Sea turtles can survive much longer without oxygen than would otherwise be possible under water and these fish are known to survive at high temperatures up to 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit (1,300 degrees Celsius).\n\nSea turtles are relatively resilient to any weather stress; they do not have very long lived life span. Unlike other sea turtles species such as Atlantic seabirds or sea cucumbers, Sea turtles do not grow as fast as other sea animals. The only time that sea turtles die is when food is unavailable, so they are still considered viable for life. The Sea Turtle Habitat Preservation Act, which was enacted in 2001 to promote biodiversity, allows the use of marine life at high levels of marine habitat (like ponds, lakes and wetlands) by commercial fishers. The legislation specifically protects a handful of species from further erosion or degradation by fish. This protection is currently being tested in the West after it was approved to protect many species of large fish in the West. As a result, the Sea Turtle Habitat Preservation Act appears to be a major step towards understanding how the Earth's natural environment is changing. The legislation is one that would really help protect and protect these Earth Star mushrooms for future generations.\n\nYou can find all information for sea turtle species in our online publication Sea Turtle Information.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2003-2018: Nature Research Institute\n\nRelated Publications:\n\nA few interesting facts about ocean ecosystems from our research","token_len":612,"entropy":[8.7598,10.8648,7.4962,7.7444,1.6773,1.2529,1.7773,0.7178,6.9418,6.6876,10.9597,5.5886,0.4341,3.5729,6.9353,6.72,6.9662,3.3006,1.0607,10.8945,11.6827,8.5258,3.1214,4.6348,0.2313,0.0185,2.0491,8.8051,8.1801,2.7472,0.5263,4.8648,4.3912,10.5274,2.044,6.429,8.2425,1.4514,10.2695,0.977,8.9531,0.1719,1.8632,5.4782,5.7023,2.5174,5.1452,1.9301,3.4487,0.1184,7.449,3.0049,4.3904,5.9851,5.243,1.8367,3.4285,0.5426,6.6665,5.0433,2.7624,3.6466,0.0495,0.8977,4.9212,1.4019,0.4818,2.8373,4.1553,1.1449,1.6035,5.9533,0.1011,1.5335,2.4437,4.1807,6.2651,3.6777,1.9987,2.7545,2.5354,5.5456,4.774,0.1662,0.7964,2.3235,2.9,0.4112,2.4731,3.9748,3.4066,3.5722,4.5219,2.9738,0.4646,0.4332,5.2525,0.0772,0.9661,4.2874,2.6144,1.6591,2.6332,1.2862,0.4226,1.188,1.1809,0.1957,2.384,2.4014,4.2529,0.853,3.8585,2.2608,3.794,0.8295,0.3404,3.52,4.3375,1.4399,5.7758,2.2222,4.6713,1.2338,1.8707,0.0623,2.1171,2.1363,2.6311,1.7162,0.0014,3.9924,2.5738,1.1727,5.8503,1.6205,0.9355,0.0558,0.0872,1.4167,0.3307,0.1735,0.7044,0.3798,0.1492,3.2421,1.8645,3.8462,6.216,3.9168,2.6069,1.6896,4.6452,1.3233,1.1711,1.0784,4.1335,5.4266,2.6238,3.2051,2.0006,2.9967,1.22,0.9009,3.8759,4.8855,6.7721,1.9071,5.3128,0.4173,2.7237,1.5942,1.2378,3.8505,2.6432,0.9584,5.2564,5.8362,0.1197,1.8997,5.1266,1.8505,3.473,1.4057,4.1823,3.4795,5.4335,3.5834,1.3919,1.4206,0.0093,3.379,3.1984,3.8571,0.7631,3.9824,2.4935,0.1706,5.7897,2.1837,3.6813,1.5298,1.1809,4.0527,2.5567,1.2825,3.433,1.4139,0.097,5.3637,1.1511,0.1909,6.4743,2.8882,2.2994,1.2898,0.346,1.9263,2.8633,2.6407,0.0043,1.2177,4.4389,4.7862,5.6217,2.2617,1.9671,2.3622,5.2233,0.0024,2.7271,3.5505,2.1623,3.1434,0.7,2.2536,4.565,1.6474,4.7385,2.9964,1.6187,2.2997,0.7054,1.5885,2.3496,2.3524,3.3936,5.4228,2.4434,0.836,3.354,2.0479,1.4623,3.5938,3.7363,7.785,1.7966,0.8476,4.0516,0.0118,4.5353,4.1347,4.8547,0.5499,3.2637,1.7634,4.2349,3.3764,0.4611,1.485,0.433,1.1241,2.4655,0.3246,5.2358,5.3369,2.8006,2.6826,4.1269,5.753,1.8874,2.9479,2.5623,0.802,2.1091,0.473,5.562,1.5394,4.3562,0.8703,2.1675,1.4201,0.455,0.4058,1.5398,1.7587,3.6644,5.4959,0.3075,4.5424,4.7525,3.1149,1.2777,1.0657,3.587,0.8195,0.4492,5.2283,4.0099,0.3355,3.3672,4.6334,1.0107,0.284,5.4638,6.4757,4.2628,4.9636,0.0628,5.0509,0.0,2.1919,3.9019,1.4837,4.9922,1.2376,2.5744,2.0413,4.9691,0.444,2.8059,1.6489,1.2704,5.2005,3.6538,0.2731,1.146,3.8221,3.0011,4.3398,4.503,2.4164,1.5261,3.3961,0.602,2.1893,4.0112,2.7943,1.2269,3.6599,0.0167,3.0749,0.3094,0.5682,0.7202,0.5191,0.975,1.763,0.017,2.8847,0.4746,0.0618,0.422,2.2828,0.0002,2.336,0.8681,1.3484,5.3079,5.5581,0.6322,4.2175,3.278,4.2766,5.2276,1.4863,3.1116,0.1801,2.2767,4.7261,2.2844,5.2711,2.1658,2.7122,1.3183,5.5414,1.8526,0.9955,0.4696,6.0434,3.8685,0.0025,5.4964,3.9223,0.5273,0.0351,2.8165,2.729,5.0961,0.1545,0.1869,2.0332,0.987,1.7927,0.0451,3.9249,3.6903,0.8602,0.4942,1.0521,0.5647,2.8884,1.0782,2.715,3.3866,3.5812,2.3205,1.3903,0.0872,3.5986,0.8199,0.6387,5.3006,0.5858,3.4561,2.235,3.039,1.2061,1.7395,5.6514,4.0339,5.2652,2.4996,2.444,0.7442,2.1238,2.3312,2.2795,3.2373,0.0213,5.8734,1.4571,2.7874,1.5773,0.7909,1.8914,0.3837,4.3103,2.933,4.4689,5.3844,1.5561,3.093,1.454,3.2867,0.0378,2.4053,1.7606,4.58,3.7549,3.041,1.3497,5.1232,2.2909,4.0149,4.2045,5.3983,0.9157,1.8876,2.3311,3.3472,0.6328,3.9311,4.5546,2.7879,0.2462,1.0767,1.7412,3.9831,4.726,3.0689,4.2111,5.8029,0.0022,1.3083,2.4685,4.7952,4.1283,2.8336,2.4706,2.0382,5.2888,1.6674,2.7325,3.9877,1.4171,5.1414,1.0438,4.4427,0.8717,1.6071,5.5017,5.4824,3.2568,0.2712,3.0545,4.3462,2.5258,4.8628,0.9187,0.9073,5.7281,2.2323,2.5277,0.944,3.4617,0.5874,4.7444,1.6867,0.3993,0.6694,1.6038,1.7744,0.1056,0.0913,0.0131,0.1475,0.0129,6.3338,0.1672,0.4446,1.7631,2.3992,1.2332,1.654,4.6506,1.7352,1.9694,2.774,1.7377,3.4824,0.9265,2.1048,0.9828,0.7804,2.7261,3.5764,2.1399,4.6377,1.5798,2.9799,5.7191,1.2902,3.3533,3.5823,2.0247,3.2461,5.602,3.8293,4.326,3.9336,0.7157,0.4473,0.3721,0.5198,0.0002,5.6345,0.3223,2.0745,3.6225,3.5839,4.6467,3.6053,0.3812,1.6769,1.7341,2.2348,3.309,4.5056,2.61,0.2696,3.908,0.9993,1.0086,0.0002,5.0602,0.6257,3.3015,0.9416,0.6913,4.8986,4.7354,5.328,1.6229,2.7149,0.0003,4.241,2.6264,0.4262,0.4658,0.0001,4.499,5.5722,3.8246,1.9952,0.3933,4.7379,4.2718,4.6157,4.4375,3.3797]}
{"id":3450,"ended":false,"length":561,"gen_text":"The Big Ten entered seven teams in the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, ranging from Indiana making its 37th trip and earning a number one seed to Minnesota making its 8th trip and three-seed in the Tournament to No. 18 Mississippi. Kentucky made its first-ever appearance with No. 10 Ohio State, and was the only school in the conference to compete at a tournament since the 1995 Women's National Championship.\n\nOhio State finished 10-4 after coming up short of the team's three points in the second quarter, and were outscored 37-30 by North Texas in the final five minutes after being stopped by No. 11 Missouri in the quarter.\n\nA 3-1 victory on home court came as Ohio State fell to a team led twice by quarterback Johnny Manziel for its lowest mark of the season with a loss of 22-15 to the Rebels in Tallahassee this past week.\n\n\"It hurts really bad,\" Johnson said. \"(A couple) games left, and there's so much to talk about.\n\n\"We just got outplayed a lot early in the game. We couldn't get any close in the paint, so we came alive on a lot of our big plays. But we just had some turnovers. We had to get a little too close to give ourselves some room, too, which was so important in the second half. We just went out there and put our bodies where we wanted them to go and had some nice games.\"\n\nOhio State had its best two days of the season at home as they had the game's first possession of the game when one of quarterback Tyler Boyd and offensive guard Tyler Ennis missed a 17-14 field goal by Kelly Mason by a 6-point margin. The Volunteers went up for the long distance on four offensive possessions, but found themselves in the lead thanks in part to Josh Johnson's 4-yard TD run.\n\nThe Wolverines led by six points on an uncharacteristically difficult first half with two free throws by Kelly Mason and Ennis. Mason's first was the first of his career, for which he was suspended for the first three game, while Ennis returned from an extended stay on the sidelines with three broken ribs and the back injury that limited him to five appearances in the past 15 games.\n\nMason said he had just about the best one-half performance he's had in his college career. He has 13 points in 20 career games and is now 26-28 -- his first year back from knee surgery -- and with 10, he's 11-4 in his past 16 games.\n\n\"I think it was pretty clear how it went,\" Mason said. \"I knew it was a good game. I've wanted my career to end over this. I wasn't just trying to pass the ball off to the bigs. I knew we needed to continue this, we needed to score. I just have to keep working to take a little break.

{"id":419,"ended":true,"length":551,"gen_text":"The earliest written records of Ireland come from classical Greco @ - @ Roman geographers. Ptolemy in his Almagest refers to Ireland as < unk > < unk > ( Little Britain ), but < i > < s = > < \/i> ( The *s * < i > < s > < i >< \/s>.)\n\n, but < in the example of < unk > < s = > < \/s> ).\n\nThere are also some minor and relatively insignificant additions to our own Irish history. Irish and English were still living at the same time, between 1567 and 898. We have no record of an English-speaking island in the middle of the 18th century, so there were fewer \"good\" Irishmen, with less or no Irish blood. If any one Irishman had come to Ireland to live more or less in another land group in the 19th century, he would have been allowed to live in Ireland for some time longer. And, what we do know, is there is no recorded Irish-European contact between 5 million and 7 million years ago. This comes mostly from the discovery of the *a * \/ a and the subsequent * e - \/ e - \/ a of Ireland and of the Anglo-Saxons (in England) during the Middle Ages.\n\nIn the first centuries, this association also occurred (with great success) in England:\n\n...The \" Irish \" was an important group of individuals and cultural groups. Their culture included several cultures of other peoples (the Middle Ages, Anglo-Saxon Europe), many languages (Irish), and even an assortment of tribes and tribes-that consisted mostly of Gaul, the \"Soulless Sea, and a large number of other parts of Australia, and their peoples in this part of Europe; at least among a little considerable numbers in the South-West.\"\n\nAncestries: the first part of the Irish-European connection\n\nIrish was part of the Anglo-Saxon family; its language is Celtic. There is little mention in the historical record of the Irish people, but they certainly lived side by side in the South-West, about one month apart from one another.\n\nOf course, many of the peoples and cultures that did live side by side in the South-West, and some of them were still living in their pre-contact times, came to Ireland for religious and cultural reasons. Others, like the Gaelic people, came to Ireland to live with the Anglo-Saxons. As a community, they held, and held onto, some of their cultural and religious traditions, and shared many things with the Anglo-Saxons. So that there would be a continuity of language, some of our earliest references to the Irish people are very early sources, like a letter to a king (not so much a document of a person, but of a person; in English the letter A was a reference to the family, and the family was the English).","token_len":613,"entropy":[9.605,6.0046,2.0158,0.5928,7.4969,5.1548,0.1238,10.6401,10.0355,0.0199,18.4623,6.7265,4.6132,5.8889,8.8618,4.767,2.0943,6.3911,3.3017,0.0348,0.1056,4.5181,3.4354,7.7228,5.402,0.4765,10.6455,0.1326,3.3569,0.5469,8.82,9.1329,6.7195,4.4264,4.1682,4.1171,0.1909,0.6965,3.5553,12.2688,6.8132,4.3671,2.7618,4.0173,5.9345,1.0817,0.5974,5.6557,5.176,1.8073,0.6331,5.0261,3.0563,0.8247,3.3377,4.4099,5.1462,4.5874,3.3891,2.4346,2.0481,0.7708,1.4881,1.3214,1.7264,1.09,1.7853,5.1203,0.8699,0.833,0.4334,6.8513,2.134,0.0505,4.6682,0.332,0.1521,5.3595,2.3626,6.0084,2.5527,2.8258,2.1647,0.0052,0.076,0.1785,2.4167,0.6482,0.0276,0.0499,0.2509,0.4015,0.0664,3.6129,0.9975,0.0002,4.7722,0.7225,2.0413,2.4706,5.1089,4.7142,4.8773,4.8674,4.9143,0.7689,4.4074,4.6244,3.0705,2.2022,1.2055,6.3032,4.7901,1.785,3.8669,4.5868,3.6314,2.7505,0.4028,0.3687,0.087,1.1104,5.9385,3.2002,4.7711,0.2143,6.183,4.6135,1.4114,4.1307,1.9736,2.579,2.6591,0.1508,3.7757,2.2891,3.321,1.1787,4.3391,2.4212,1.6105,3.8165,0.1403,0.6225,3.8632,0.0071,0.081,1.1248,2.851,2.346,4.2059,5.1832,5.0506,5.7286,1.2561,1.6974,4.5716,3.1126,5.2327,3.2647,4.8201,0.2484,1.9356,4.7091,0.8966,5.4127,3.3209,4.0492,3.4304,0.5608,1.9811,3.8048,1.2804,0.5072,2.8055,2.4095,5.7367,1.344,0.0445,3.0223,5.4015,3.347,5.2306,4.1958,0.9849,3.4989,0.0011,0.0774,0.2336,1.9182,1.0181,0.4987,0.642,5.7817,0.2017,1.8145,1.4135,1.5089,2.9097,3.4127,0.2759,3.1178,0.822,4.7489,2.814,5.5903,2.7769,1.7716,0.4033,2.1021,0.728,5.214,2.0567,0.7165,2.747,1.8279,2.0455,3.3774,2.5238,1.2132,5.5399,5.0058,0.6597,2.7041,0.1128,0.1834,0.0982,0.5551,3.2744,5.8086,5.6943,0.0719,1.1837,5.2909,0.2442,1.7952,4.8928,4.6133,2.41,5.9071,3.1146,5.0939,1.3275,6.4311,4.8259,6.0274,4.779,1.8015,0.9877,1.7566,0.3939,3.0646,4.2446,4.0129,2.966,3.4096,1.2767,5.4196,0.0435,0.8835,1.198,2.5244,4.3758,4.4932,2.1372,3.7018,0.3664,1.8477,0.0089,0.4528,1.1488,0.0003,3.867,1.6958,3.9182,3.7486,3.0662,5.0057,5.5381,6.3317,2.7176,4.8646,3.8231,5.2722,2.7258,0.5117,1.1668,3.4879,4.1955,2.4718,0.0002,5.3491,4.9701,5.6256,6.3015,1.7334,2.9934,3.7771,2.8727,3.8508,0.8261,4.4524,2.8187,4.798,1.3517,2.3547,3.4989,3.6027,3.7867,5.2971,5.4905,2.5208,4.9566,2.1386,2.4308,3.7761,4.4059,0.4657,0.8137,4.3538,0.016,0.1635,0.4959,2.8887,3.2502,4.415,3.3958,1.5787,3.022,2.4697,0.9973,3.9056,3.5515,5.1783,0.0104,3.87,1.7498,1.4937,4.7952,4.9704,6.0727,2.73,0.0199,5.5604,1.5355,2.4446,4.3471,5.2981,4.8789,3.3697,0.0464,4.4028,4.245,1.6691,4.0633,2.5723,0.8177,0.0168,2.6108,4.2033,0.1214,6.571,1.327,3.059,5.923,4.4887,3.3443,4.627,1.9416,0.1934,2.8761,4.5074,5.7953,1.147,4.0927,5.1087,4.9486,5.8855,2.247,3.0233,1.6641,3.5403,2.1256,1.9248,2.7277,1.5352,0.0005,5.4156,3.7566,3.0546,3.6891,3.4667,3.8832,5.1365,0.2576,0.8929,1.7922,1.7837,0.3891,3.177,2.0749,0.0003,4.9617,3.9338,4.8401,0.0219,0.7578,3.4201,0.0085,0.0573,0.1354,2.6702,4.5085,3.2894,3.2215,2.3172,4.0328,1.2659,3.5493,1.4193,3.0074,3.2375,2.2038,0.8177,4.6863,0.8041,0.1171,1.7765,2.1104,3.1864,2.4602,1.955,2.6149,4.0291,3.086,5.5086,0.2366,0.0006,2.471,1.5461,3.8232,0.2578,0.1265,1.8615,5.2261,4.0803,6.4553,0.7866,1.7617,3.4764,0.0382,0.5961,1.6201,0.0002,5.252,0.5975,0.231,4.8355,0.9974,0.4805,5.0669,3.656,1.4006,1.935,5.206,1.4193,2.2323,0.0409,0.0004,0.8706,0.8086,0.2729,0.0432,0.0138,2.6739,2.4352,3.4414,0.7471,0.9438,1.5029,4.0066,0.8839,1.0959,4.2755,4.6715,0.0185,2.6793,2.67,0.5034,5.8739,1.5473,0.471,4.0377,4.9954,2.1027,0.8665,0.1946,0.9495,5.8258,1.8674,1.1802,0.532,5.7184,0.0118,1.4727,0.8203,2.7649,0.918,0.4029,1.7875,2.4756,2.2041,1.882,2.4172,0.0132,0.0512,0.3498,1.2307,4.7272,2.2955,6.7532,0.5168,1.5838,4.8192,5.6971,2.2773,3.4081,5.9864,0.3613,3.2326,0.965,1.6606,2.7951,1.7363,1.1754,1.0202,1.4961,1.3613,4.3944,3.0363,4.5136,1.1519,1.2127,1.0468,0.0026,0.0079,0.3803,0.6936,5.1978,4.9486,3.9285,3.8909,0.5183,2.2637,4.2467,0.6331,4.9969,1.5197,4.2399,0.7273,5.8553,3.6658,3.7679,0.3293,1.3052,1.1151,2.3392,2.1568,4.3724,2.444,4.8282,1.8548,4.2579,3.4702,3.0758,2.5302,2.3036,3.8917,3.3575,5.1137,4.9054,1.3537,1.4986,4.4176,2.3012,3.1758,3.9292,2.0564,0.9572,2.5492,0.7127,1.7012,5.7268,3.819,3.3882,2.7423,2.347,5.3816,2.5967,2.156,5.1054,0.0826,1.3728,5.0516,2.1583,1.6026,1.4111,1.944,1.2273,2.2459,4.2244,4.5519]}
{"id":3265,"ended":true,"length":554,"gen_text":"The Presidential Palace ( Croatian : < unk > dvori, also referred to by the metonym Pantov\u010dak ) in Zagreb is the official residence of the president. The president does not actually live in the palace, that is for certain, except in the presence of members of the Romanian Red Army. In November 1989, President Poroshenko was granted the status of First Bulgarian Prime Minister, despite a dispute over the succession policy on the part of Ukraine. He was later elected speaker before his term ended. He received a high-level degree and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1991. However, it is interesting to ponder the status of his former residence. The President occupied the second floor of the Presidential Building ( Zagreb : dvora ej ). Although he is not a public official, he maintains a number of private residences: his office remains in a large rectangular building with small columns, his residence has a small balcony with marble floors and a large fireplace. He keeps the presidential offices in a small office garden. He built his own office in the Presidential Palace ( Zagreb : pom-gosto\u0161 ). President Poroshenko held public office for seven months in 1993 and 1994, although he resigned as Prime Minister. He spent last year of the presidency in charge of the defense sector ( Bosnia & Herzegovina, Serbia ) and in charge of the reconstruction of public institutions in Belgrade. In 2002, he took over as Prime Minister, after his predecessor, Boris Todoroki, resigned over the nationalistic and separatist activities of Bulgaria in Bosnia-Herzegovina. As the head of the executive of the United States-NATO-Eurasian-Central Bank, he has also served as Chairman, President and Deputy Prime Minister of the Federal Reserve, and Deputy Federal Minister for Finance. President Yuriy Yurchikhin held the post of Prime Minister in September 1999 and then returned to his position in October 2001. President Yuriy Yurchikhin held the post of Prime Minister again in January 2000 after being elected president for three consecutive terms with no elected opposition. Before he took office, he was Deputy Chairman of the Federal Bank of Brest, Minister for Government Affairs at the United States Department of State and as chair of the Board of Trustees of Russian Federation Foreign & Democratic Banksters, which is charged with supervising the banking activities of the bank. During his first year in office, he secured his appointment as First Bulgarian Prime Minister after it was confirmed to him that he would not be able to retain the post. He is recognized by the Bulgarian president as having some personal experience in international affairs, including foreign affairs of the Russian Federation. His views and statements were always characterized by his professional understanding of international affairs and he acted freely and quickly. In the end, he became President for a third time in 2002, after losing his first two term. He resigned from the post in April 2007 (as he was unable to take charge of the Federal Reserve and to hold the presidency).","token_len":613,"entropy":[10.5431,5.6618,4.3823,17.1257,4.5595,8.0618,10.5129,4.5704,7.2822,6.5252,4.4112,8.8677,4.9791,7.0328,5.0215,0.0115,3.1925,1.2648,10.4103,2.8219,10.9918,4.6278,4.6356,5.6064,4.2134,3.1174,4.3741,0.2222,0.0044,3.3357,1.9414,3.915,0.3577,0.177,0.8671,2.4428,1.3498,1.6425,2.6556,5.3447,0.0569,5.7827,1.5709,1.054,1.1981,1.1219,1.0468,6.9427,0.3024,3.31,1.5742,1.4979,5.0548,1.7531,1.5058,3.9527,0.006,4.7166,0.0246,0.4578,5.8211,4.7295,0.5621,1.1999,2.7042,5.0286,4.201,0.4944,3.2659,4.0145,0.3381,2.2677,4.3499,1.7888,4.6726,0.0592,4.3501,4.2163,2.6348,0.0074,1.5414,4.4295,3.5071,4.8242,1.1888,1.1092,4.2761,5.0756,4.9806,0.8748,1.73,0.0009,6.6778,0.7414,3.1263,1.3462,3.1023,1.8431,6.0066,6.8463,2.883,1.7374,1.0398,0.8531,2.9987,5.0014,1.7544,3.3754,2.0244,0.7392,5.3879,3.3155,3.351,4.6525,0.9772,1.4927,0.8061,1.011,2.0468,0.4902,4.4762,0.0313,3.9833,1.0046,5.0143,0.2024,8.4557,1.519,4.5902,0.0554,2.2876,4.5143,2.7937,1.8719,2.0506,3.7238,6.2666,1.0567,4.8522,1.3923,0.2265,0.2075,1.7782,5.0799,2.7152,3.6529,0.1155,0.0096,0.4001,3.8956,0.3457,5.674,5.4424,3.0408,5.9621,4.9903,1.6662,2.2455,1.4441,1.7561,3.8317,1.6878,0.1988,0.6734,5.139,1.0056,4.6905,0.0021,3.4366,0.8165,5.3695,2.6071,1.7619,6.4911,1.0545,2.5934,3.9891,5.5422,1.2993,2.2835,5.8976,4.4502,1.8428,3.9576,2.3154,3.3947,1.1796,2.7465,3.668,2.77,5.3191,2.7506,1.3055,1.086,1.8056,4.3022,0.7446,2.2502,5.4654,2.7758,3.8966,4.5956,1.1052,1.3463,1.9458,2.9988,6.2639,2.039,2.1298,5.9579,1.954,1.6111,2.4742,1.1105,1.3619,2.2556,0.5166,0.8478,0.7521,0.0164,0.0026,0.0764,4.3617,4.2907,4.7616,5.2261,5.265,3.1709,3.7422,3.7036,4.5239,0.4994,0.0005,5.6587,5.2346,0.4298,1.75,3.979,3.4272,1.0173,3.2963,1.934,1.7958,1.2549,4.1715,0.6835,3.4443,3.2641,2.6186,0.0016,3.2296,1.3638,5.1968,6.1579,0.4606,2.8177,2.3738,2.6632,0.8446,3.6987,0.0343,0.9471,5.0317,2.859,3.3915,5.3704,3.4689,0.0017,0.0001,0.0002,0.0012,4.0513,3.3952,3.868,0.7202,2.3805,1.5066,0.0078,0.8882,5.2366,0.5696,5.1406,2.9378,2.3825,5.9917,0.0019,1.0257,1.9417,5.1421,0.4592,0.6166,3.3264,0.9253,1.4367,2.4014,0.0017,2.4319,2.7745,2.5691,2.0634,0.865,3.6036,5.5178,2.8975,3.2505,0.589,1.7912,4.3638,1.4539,5.7776,2.1816,2.3971,3.3193,4.1592,0.6759,4.4997,3.4236,4.041,2.3083,0.0209,0.0062,0.0001,0.0001,0.0018,0.4203,4.5183,2.5071,3.0695,0.0089,0.437,5.5525,2.5347,0.4247,5.2134,1.9076,2.0117,2.8048,0.0014,2.8863,4.3941,0.7038,0.8307,3.8053,2.4071,0.9137,0.7498,0.7371,2.4077,2.9907,2.1732,0.3158,4.5643,3.7581,2.3928,0.7987,3.0173,1.1477,0.026,0.2854,0.6034,2.9642,1.1921,2.7907,1.965,3.6331,4.5918,1.233,2.7065,1.5842,0.5773,3.7804,6.7584,3.5977,0.0771,1.6588,2.3831,0.9148,0.1363,4.3784,1.198,1.4084,0.261,2.5017,0.0105,1.3717,4.3532,2.4444,2.0773,4.8104,4.9651,0.1659,1.5242,2.7207,1.5934,2.5896,1.8241,0.4566,3.0992,0.8895,0.7459,0.0152,0.4564,0.2145,0.0177,0.0046,2.9003,0.6272,0.1839,0.0224,0.6331,0.0028,4.2784,0.179,2.3648,2.6742,3.7886,3.1986,1.4896,2.5388,3.8102,3.2329,1.2448,0.27,5.138,3.4497,5.5105,4.706,0.4505,5.1482,2.5342,2.5955,0.7156,0.4664,1.2256,1.2129,4.6422,4.0584,0.2797,0.122,2.1107,2.3731,0.3307,4.4794,3.5144,2.1631,4.652,1.3672,6.4173,1.7452,5.0276,0.1776,5.6766,0.6561,3.0761,0.0011,1.2481,2.0845,3.2483,5.037,0.3335,0.1266,2.7992,0.0474,3.6549,0.0032,0.2816,5.8573,1.5973,5.6768,4.7183,6.3821,0.8075,3.0604,2.1518,2.3444,1.9664,5.6877,0.0895,2.2265,0.001,0.9114,2.7301,2.8856,0.0869,0.6909,4.8821,0.6063,3.1451,0.501,2.9281,2.6301,0.9324,0.0732,0.1426,0.9764,5.5861,4.6305,2.9968,0.4727,4.4086,0.1055,0.1387,0.0028,3.7554,4.9801,0.3355,3.2249,4.5929,2.2346,0.2987,1.2766,1.1732,1.3672,0.6926,2.1885,0.0291,4.9947,0.9718,1.047,1.1722,1.6898,3.0268,6.0723,1.4486,0.6061,2.6584,5.5079,0.4665,2.3291,5.9855,3.9927,2.933,0.9151,3.0222,0.8376,1.3369,1.7125,4.1796,1.6261,3.3381,0.7103,2.9746,0.0431,0.7358,3.3981,5.62,3.2281,4.6822,3.3962,5.4524,5.4276,0.4691,1.6088,5.3458,4.957,0.7234,0.9456,0.6646,1.103,4.9295,6.0132,6.0188,1.3499,5.7082,1.4645,2.1276,2.5606,4.1851,0.108,0.709,2.8809,2.758,4.2009,2.2652,2.095,0.9116,1.3843,3.1625,1.3756,1.6108,4.9089,1.3973,2.3388,3.5232,3.1773,1.3447,1.7067,4.5999,1.3915,0.9055,1.3766,1.2997,3.0799,3.3612,4.8545,5.061,3.4623,1.6835,3.5447,0.0193,3.3123,3.061,0.3252,0.4349,2.3774,0.7051,2.7796,4.6819,3.6359,1.0918,2.8978,2.0506]}
{"id":327,"ended":false,"length":548,"gen_text":"He is generally portrayed as a large elderly man with a powerful voice. A modern folktale by noted Yangzhou storyteller Wang Shaotang ( 1889 \u2013 1968 ), whom folklore researcher Vibeke < unkraut > has described in the popular folktale of the Bighy Mountain, he was seen roaming with his wife and children in the countryside when the two disappeared.\n\nThere is a curious similarity between the Chinese version of the tale and the original Bighy Mountain story. During the early Middle Kingdom during the early Dynastic Period, the main plot of the story concerns a man called Wang Shaotang who happens to be visiting him. The man gives him the name Bighy Mountain and the king tells him he would like to return home as soon as he sees him again. A few days later, he is told by his friend Liao Jia that he can marry another woman, giving Liao the title of Prince Liao. In a short while, the king tells Liao that Wang Shaotang won't marry another man. The following date has taken on a second life as Liao goes outside to meet with Liao. The date given in this story is unknown. In another version, Liao's cousin, Liu Duan, finds his cousin killed when he is trying to get a job at the local paper. During the next decade, the story goes public on the internet.\n\nThe other story is that of Liao Yung, the younger son of an elderly man called Yanyang. Liu Hsin (known in China as L. Yanyang), is the child sister of Liao Yung. In the story, Liu and Yanyang are the very same, if not identical, and as a result, they have become good friends and their mother takes them back home with Yanyang after a little while. However, in a similar way, when Liao returns to the family where she gave birth to Liao, Yanyang's life seems to be in a hopeless situation. The child sister, Yanyang Yeng, is raised by the same people, but is still very concerned about Liao. She's at present trying to get some money to pay for her education, but when she realizes her relationship with Liao isn't what she wants, she asks Liao not to marry her, but Liao turns around and claims it is OK. The tale plays out with great care.\n\nThe tale's author is known for his tales about many characters from the first half of the twentieth century such as the old, rich, and strong. In a third version of the tale, Yun Ming reports that the old man gave one of his disciples, who was a famous poet, a piece of paper called a Book of Chinese History. The note reads, \"As you've already heard, the Book of Chinese History is a document of Chinese history written for the people of the world.\"\n\nKun Shaoi ( the Younger, the King)","token_len":613,"entropy":[3.4093,7.1999,5.7282,0.1894,0.8872,7.714,8.7279,1.0133,1.3591,1.028,7.1803,2.9687,1.2933,4.6275,6.8014,8.4883,1.9358,3.5143,9.802,12.1366,7.2449,7.6526,0.4949,0.0104,3.6295,7.0699,5.7359,2.9802,3.1583,12.9342,1.6387,5.3253,0.8266,7.9527,9.4334,8.4423,6.4897,7.875,6.1117,10.5712,10.028,4.941,5.779,1.5954,3.3067,3.159,2.0604,3.5277,2.3358,4.926,3.506,1.0732,3.1898,1.8405,5.9448,5.1129,6.8667,3.466,3.1994,2.7303,2.2615,4.9003,6.1543,4.6665,1.4171,2.6927,1.3969,1.3844,1.6506,0.8288,4.0601,4.2851,1.6823,4.4554,5.1936,0.7781,1.6984,0.0195,4.7085,1.1937,1.673,5.0942,2.9865,0.3954,0.9647,4.4537,3.1247,0.3394,0.9667,2.4093,0.532,0.601,4.0667,4.4397,0.0523,0.0064,0.2538,1.6409,0.9412,5.3391,0.3991,3.0399,4.855,2.998,5.7813,0.1621,3.7976,4.2595,0.1613,0.8318,0.7368,1.3861,5.038,5.65,1.3036,0.2904,0.868,6.2943,1.496,3.0696,2.8089,3.634,1.4227,0.0772,0.0026,1.0817,5.5367,0.0268,0.4016,5.9792,5.9433,2.5087,2.0103,3.2466,5.2072,1.4109,1.9538,1.7111,3.522,0.1009,0.0217,0.3966,1.5542,2.7963,5.4267,3.2386,0.1322,2.7609,4.6741,0.6121,0.1193,4.1715,1.6684,4.1686,0.6758,0.0045,1.1772,4.1853,0.5214,2.062,0.3003,4.6288,2.348,1.3468,0.1804,0.506,2.2341,2.3977,3.6481,1.1606,1.3941,4.2687,5.4509,1.8786,4.145,1.265,1.1597,0.6324,3.9067,6.0707,3.5343,1.3416,1.8229,6.0977,4.39,0.0006,1.1481,1.8515,0.5813,4.6319,3.9923,0.0531,1.6265,3.342,3.311,3.7208,1.7247,0.3303,1.2987,1.7162,2.4273,2.4071,0.0001,0.7458,2.0744,0.3615,0.0011,0.0014,5.5117,0.185,0.8941,3.2002,1.42,1.827,2.1155,4.581,7.652,4.0799,5.8438,2.5937,0.6721,5.922,1.2574,2.6482,2.2655,0.0007,4.3219,6.0691,1.153,2.314,2.8973,2.9428,0.0043,1.1165,2.1121,4.891,6.0644,2.6686,2.8706,1.1964,0.574,3.5889,1.3004,3.0512,4.0909,2.1998,0.654,2.1096,0.0009,2.7585,4.4717,2.2734,3.959,4.5568,1.845,0.5789,5.3976,3.3135,1.3516,4.2978,3.2018,1.0599,3.0162,3.3108,0.0062,2.9674,2.1266,2.8145,1.733,1.3947,2.6438,3.5532,0.6034,5.1162,0.7683,2.26,4.9013,0.4263,1.4625,1.7197,3.0824,6.7949,4.1695,1.1571,1.6474,1.1045,0.8734,0.0002,1.6072,5.7734,3.0162,2.2905,2.14,0.8189,2.7504,0.0527,4.1766,3.6469,1.8419,1.9482,3.5641,2.0269,0.0324,3.5022,2.3357,1.7352,2.4928,4.2909,4.8224,2.7686,1.2063,5.4021,5.7583,3.5452,3.8197,6.4543,2.0833,2.069,0.0723,2.9005,4.602,2.0375,1.6524,0.0232,2.2332,2.3956,1.8232,5.7597,5.4718,0.1095,2.4892,0.0205,0.5996,0.0247,1.1658,2.5483,0.9438,1.7302,0.3853,2.9183,4.5274,2.1236,0.0002,0.0019,1.3405,3.7474,5.7182,0.578,2.6132,6.1148,0.9965,2.0447,1.0733,2.3824,4.2895,2.3818,0.2891,0.813,1.5608,1.9611,4.144,4.7574,0.3041,2.5288,4.5629,3.8272,4.8582,1.4591,3.3425,3.2654,3.1884,6.4289,0.0004,0.0033,3.3482,3.1649,5.5009,0.7621,0.1934,2.8005,0.0242,2.2102,3.1504,4.0785,1.8414,0.341,3.8368,1.1032,0.032,4.0397,0.9681,1.2889,3.2404,5.5074,2.4288,6.4537,0.2375,0.5368,1.5302,0.075,1.4536,2.2324,0.0003,0.0017,2.5087,4.6364,3.5989,0.2685,0.8612,1.9716,1.998,5.4339,2.1,0.5484,2.6398,4.8705,1.9767,2.5496,2.6933,0.0064,0.0061,3.3307,5.1437,0.4012,1.5028,5.0874,0.5656,2.2364,2.2684,2.7567,2.6986,1.6342,3.009,3.2697,3.1468,5.6606,0.6516,2.2888,0.0014,1.8135,2.8156,5.4539,5.2854,5.2064,3.1635,0.0508,1.8128,3.875,0.8873,1.7241,1.8303,0.5555,0.932,2.8111,1.2869,0.7004,2.7064,0.9183,4.1257,3.387,5.8463,0.1567,0.6635,0.0022,3.6714,0.0003,3.6547,0.4314,2.9487,0.2726,0.3018,4.9062,1.3505,0.0043,3.6188,0.0039,1.5728,0.3336,1.9058,1.9284,3.044,0.0039,5.1663,3.4331,0.1559,5.4312,3.9045,2.1536,5.5551,0.9605,2.559,5.4788,6.062,0.5955,3.5275,3.5022,3.8567,1.9858,0.9264,0.0002,1.6044,3.8518,3.6828,4.656,1.7489,2.4092,0.9517,0.5865,5.8021,2.0411,5.8333,3.3494,2.7829,1.1936,5.4434,1.2584,0.0301,0.0542,3.3242,0.0161,3.9565,0.0012,2.2466,5.0283,4.6863,4.092,0.6619,1.1093,5.5671,1.2839,2.485,3.4081,5.4717,1.4772,1.1695,0.1507,0.9531,0.1796,6.3008,4.5604,5.8942,0.572,2.1845,3.0392,0.7625,5.5787,5.2323,0.3464,0.3271,5.7931,2.2217,3.2827,1.0198,1.8389,4.3805,2.7562,0.3697,1.1105,3.9502,0.0116,1.1082,2.765,1.3048,5.0791,0.1471,5.1065,3.4033,0.7171,1.366,5.9962,2.0263,1.1894,0.1039,5.3012,1.6591,5.3175,3.2652,2.0067,0.3468,1.7571,2.2668,0.0544,0.2788,0.0587,0.837,1.5211,4.8494,1.0817,3.35,0.557,2.4435,3.5853,0.8891,3.0792,0.4348,1.1464,3.0742,1.7912,1.798,0.0002,5.8528,4.3663,3.0726,2.112,3.6707,1.5296,5.9913,4.6391,2.1877,1.6647,4.1944,2.2673]}
{"id":3284,"ended":false,"length":560,"gen_text":"The Mekong River remained free of dams until 1993 because of its complex system of rapids which wreck boats, and the unusual monsoon season which reverses the course of some of its branches. Other regions in the Mekong basin suffered similar floods and droughts of the past four years.\n\nIn most cases, the country's largest dam failure occurred in 2007 in the east, a period of major change under President Yoweri Museveni. This had been before his first and second term as president.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2008, he reversed course again and placed the Mekong in the new national budget after being elected in 2010 with the largest surpluses.\n\nMore importantly, he reversed course on a promise to eliminate \"subsidised hydrocarbon development, which produces carbon dioxide emissions,\" because of the damage caused to the rivers by dams and other development.\n\nHis latest plan called for an international project to replace the dams in the Mekong River and the Gombong Dam with smaller, less powerful dams using natural gas plants to reduce oil production and pollution.\n\nMr Museveni's government rejected the proposal.\n\n'Sustainable development'\n\nThe situation in some regions, like the country's north, has been largely transformed from an energy revolution into a highly political one, through the creation of a coalition government which will set policy in the fight against climate change.\n\nThe government is expected to announce a budget in the coming week designed to increase GDP by more than five percent by 2050 and cut spending by 40 percent by 2040.\n\nBut while that might look like a boost to the environment, it won't cut carbon emissions, it will also weaken the country's position as a global leader in energy, energy security and energy efficiency.\n\nBut with increasing political and social tensions, such as in the South China Sea, there isn't a lot of sign that China's rapid rise in importance will be reversed.\n\n\"The real challenge will be how to make it work in a way that's competitive and fair,\" said Liu Xiaobo, deputy director general for climate and energy policy in the South China Sea, which was once China's key industrial base.\n\n\"You can't turn away a lot of people who are trying to do the right thing, but you have to help them do the right thing and try to win the right people,\" he added.\n\nA new UN report that's expected to be released next week showed that China is more than halfway to achieving its ambitions to host the Olympic, space and energy games next year.\n\nChina, however, appears determined to avoid a repeat of 2008 and this is one reason why the country seems intent more on doing something that it does not believe will work.\n\n\"We all saw the change in China after the fall of the Soviet Union. We tried to create a new one in 2008,\" Li Jingxun, a former president of China's Communist Party, told CNN's \"New Day.\"","token_len":614,"entropy":[12.8322,0.2461,1.3349,8.5015,5.1728,0.666,6.071,3.0783,5.0975,5.0393,0.4572,4.1776,7.3525,3.8407,0.0389,5.9737,0.0124,5.0509,11.9846,6.2829,1.3204,3.4913,2.8621,9.0937,8.1286,0.1508,2.4602,3.1,8.8374,0.0028,1.1099,3.5683,0.0478,6.8006,1.5763,2.6208,6.9645,0.431,6.4267,5.0287,2.6068,0.7883,0.6707,0.0072,2.8592,4.4506,3.8796,3.0887,1.971,1.5635,0.0077,0.0001,3.2943,1.0275,1.7593,4.7827,1.8714,0.644,0.9526,0.0013,2.7657,4.8782,1.4135,0.3706,1.1475,5.7724,0.772,5.7452,1.644,3.2483,1.4255,0.7078,4.4595,4.0738,0.637,5.3653,1.1709,3.7019,2.9789,1.585,4.6798,4.8574,5.3606,1.2451,4.6587,0.5798,0.0007,0.035,0.0002,0.0,0.9506,4.1031,5.2718,1.4591,6.4105,3.5688,4.3441,5.6563,1.9003,1.2803,2.1719,0.1978,1.3102,1.1245,0.0003,2.4306,1.8828,4.5358,2.7593,0.0324,2.3009,0.1747,4.5784,3.7425,0.6961,3.2543,1.5786,5.3734,1.4551,3.0997,0.0018,2.6495,1.0282,5.0896,3.8495,4.6288,4.575,4.9696,1.9964,1.1946,2.9284,3.6365,2.3831,5.5462,4.713,0.3954,0.0003,2.2201,0.9704,0.0003,5.0446,4.6703,0.09,1.7701,2.872,0.4146,3.1561,2.0494,5.3554,0.4007,5.5275,4.8091,4.7178,2.2797,3.364,3.1898,1.864,2.0464,3.2204,2.0486,5.6284,5.266,0.9018,1.4813,4.5311,5.1203,1.3121,1.3146,4.9351,1.2127,2.6932,0.7764,4.2174,1.3022,2.4542,2.1245,1.4092,4.888,1.2363,0.3502,0.0002,4.4641,5.0317,2.6683,4.2026,0.0495,3.5957,4.3674,5.246,0.5506,3.8917,1.0006,2.5813,2.4151,0.6077,0.5872,0.0023,2.682,2.9347,2.0261,4.5504,5.6791,2.9381,2.1402,2.5386,4.9944,1.6548,2.9854,3.4238,0.7901,6.2784,2.815,0.517,5.7422,2.9196,2.7938,6.3077,2.1539,1.5175,3.7442,0.2868,0.3378,0.0002,3.7578,0.4619,0.0039,0.0048,1.4311,1.8821,5.8435,0.7091,2.4332,1.5558,0.612,0.0002,5.2493,4.6882,1.3841,0.5235,0.4712,0.2312,0.0001,1.7885,5.9085,1.0909,5.0218,2.6093,3.2063,2.6948,0.5861,6.1702,0.0579,3.1472,0.7716,1.2906,1.2781,4.2137,5.6902,3.5882,3.0181,3.2749,6.08,2.392,0.5484,5.1752,4.0416,0.4398,1.7923,6.2317,1.363,3.4727,0.0359,1.5503,5.8284,0.2798,3.7636,3.457,5.1338,3.7812,2.8912,1.2756,5.5488,0.0293,1.0798,0.0082,0.6566,0.1282,0.0003,1.7272,1.894,2.4572,2.511,0.0075,2.57,1.4523,3.7294,1.5612,1.7203,1.239,3.4978,6.9462,0.0381,4.8083,5.2877,0.4809,2.6101,0.0017,5.2753,1.5202,2.5387,3.545,1.53,4.1976,2.7215,0.4193,4.4273,0.0637,0.9419,1.6431,1.0329,0.3265,0.2733,0.0003,2.8055,4.4229,4.1601,3.5227,4.3339,0.9292,0.5812,5.0158,0.6939,1.0425,4.7041,0.3619,0.8689,4.2669,0.0006,4.8413,2.6956,0.444,1.7012,2.7311,0.2348,2.7666,4.8087,0.7901,1.8544,0.0118,4.5704,0.6441,0.4702,2.0506,0.9732,0.4358,3.0758,2.0944,3.7182,0.8474,0.247,2.3735,1.0995,0.4003,0.1208,0.0003,4.9663,4.6032,5.9564,3.4284,2.573,2.8631,1.7386,1.3688,4.4366,3.1746,1.3078,1.1498,2.6182,0.1965,0.0059,0.4482,3.2148,5.4002,0.0001,1.664,2.1057,0.4081,5.1967,1.0128,3.5841,2.2024,5.6207,2.7624,1.1143,5.6842,1.7246,2.1192,2.5806,0.9557,0.2802,0.0003,2.3228,1.6109,5.111,2.0648,2.7577,0.2155,2.757,0.7593,3.4707,2.571,2.0992,1.891,2.0904,2.3475,0.0939,3.64,5.186,2.0983,3.482,1.0356,0.3826,5.0287,2.3813,0.5981,0.1086,3.9175,0.5874,2.4046,3.3854,3.1098,1.3871,0.977,1.1973,3.0146,0.3772,3.9262,0.025,0.0367,2.3039,1.895,3.7433,2.8877,2.7031,0.0015,5.379,5.4809,1.2133,0.2125,0.2336,0.0002,0.7871,4.3838,1.7,0.504,4.6005,3.6402,3.9535,3.7615,0.0351,0.7308,2.164,1.2131,2.3991,0.024,2.6258,2.0098,0.3863,0.0871,1.971,1.0419,1.8653,2.3156,0.0671,5.1912,0.4927,2.6959,0.9792,0.1032,0.0625,2.4492,3.6255,0.0872,4.6023,2.156,1.1024,2.7927,3.0949,0.5132,0.9604,0.0728,0.6473,0.0002,4.2958,3.0509,4.4981,1.3171,4.8187,5.2417,1.5265,0.2687,0.5088,0.3478,1.7684,0.8939,4.5101,0.5367,1.2265,2.0168,4.2782,1.9419,2.9093,0.8565,1.8632,1.0383,4.8794,1.7086,5.3652,0.3662,6.249,7.685,6.141,0.3117,2.9881,1.3118,2.2963,0.2034,0.7011,0.3293,0.0002,2.5955,3.7059,3.1196,0.0038,4.7855,3.274,0.2201,2.7439,1.8506,0.999,0.1208,3.2093,2.9244,4.8522,3.2491,3.6187,1.8125,0.5004,1.7813,1.7711,4.8855,4.2669,6.8822,0.3929,5.103,3.303,2.8282,3.1563,4.0231,0.7797,4.1873,1.1766,2.3308,0.5711,0.5086,0.0002,1.3297,1.8658,5.9129,4.869,1.3104,5.4119,0.7362,2.2419,3.3515,1.133,3.9906,0.0476,0.5121,1.4873,0.025,2.1197,1.5838,5.9609,0.2678,4.2695,0.6638,1.3416,5.0583,2.7507,3.6715,1.9382,6.7717,4.1896,3.2775,2.6311,0.0694,1.2342,1.9456,3.9824,0.1827,1.3383,0.1556,1.7337,0.0786,0.4318,0.4756,4.7363,2.7053,1.7879,1.2351,0.0218,1.8132]}
{"id":2917,"ended":true,"length":531,"gen_text":"The existence of discrete inheritable units was first suggested by Gregor Mendel ( 1822 \u2013 1884 ). From 1857 to 1864, he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking down the inheritance of these units by way of phenotypic traits. Mendel proposed four primary inheritance models with evolutionary histories from ancient times: eukaryotic, eukaryotic, bacterial and nuclear family units. The four main models involved the distribution and distribution of different genetic variants (e.g., the E. coli family, the yeast lineage, yeast lineage units, human and human-like organism groups and the eukaryotic cell line ), and the evolution of all these units. To this day, he continues to work on eukaryotic organisms. Mendel's model also included gene flow, which is a theory of how organisms with a large number of genes change in the same genes over time. It has received less attention in recent decades but remains widely used in many developmental and ecological field settings. In this part, we argue that eukaryotic DNA has a much richer genetic history during the second half of the E. coli genome than during the first half of the yeast lineage. These eukaryotic cells were not present during the early days of life when most of their ancestors lived in South America where they might live for 1-10 years, which is the long time period of genetic drift between cells. In our study, we highlight eukaryotic cell lineages from South America and Europe and examine the evolution of eukaryotic lineage units. We then present eukaryotic eukaryotic cells from South America and Europe at different genetic and taxonomic stages of their evolution from early to early, and examine their evolution during the early phases of cell division, as well as the long distance time at which they spread across Europe and in the Americas. The study of eukaryotic species is important in providing insight into the ancestral genome of diverse natural enemies; for example, we will review how eukaryotic cells spread across Latin America, and examine the emergence of multiple evolutionary pathways for eukaryotic evolution. Other important contributions of our study, including the analysis of eukaryotic populations from the Near East (Africa), and the distribution of eukaryotic genes in the early stages of gene flow, provide valuable tools to improve understanding and understanding modern eukaryotic lineages. We hope that our study has the potential to help to answer questions about biological and environmental change during the first half of the E. coli and yeast lines, and to provide new information to new eukaryotic lines through the creation of new phyla that may reveal new insights on how cells evolved and how they were organized to evolve at different times. We hope that our study will serve as a bridge between the genetic studies of eukaryotic eukaryotic lineages at different stages of evolutionary development, and for developing new biological theories for the development and survival of new eukaryotic lineages.","token_len":616,"entropy":[9.108,0.0839,8.9083,13.1374,0.4301,5.478,5.0116,2.3835,2.5604,0.5311,8.4497,1.0463,1.0301,0.2427,2.6647,7.9123,5.1088,3.3813,1.8462,4.4901,2.3054,5.331,4.2476,4.7943,0.8298,0.952,2.8992,0.848,3.6707,3.9396,5.9887,5.0038,0.9304,13.7682,7.9128,10.7459,10.4554,0.9627,1.0475,1.9171,9.2847,3.0367,1.6065,4.7745,1.5295,3.3777,1.6795,1.9879,5.2271,0.0004,5.9795,0.2654,0.0843,3.287,0.8934,1.5898,0.0027,3.8641,4.8796,4.8345,2.4008,2.9048,5.3887,5.9169,3.8181,3.8648,3.7883,3.1797,1.7152,6.1118,0.8798,0.003,1.3645,1.3345,2.9226,0.1294,0.0095,0.0442,2.1837,5.5694,1.0364,4.5885,4.6335,3.4502,0.8503,2.107,3.7716,3.472,2.4077,4.6546,1.8674,4.0259,2.637,3.3207,0.1214,3.9918,4.1556,3.3896,2.8746,1.4478,0.1906,0.0003,0.3864,3.1805,3.922,1.7963,0.4432,2.5707,2.1805,0.912,4.3504,4.8005,0.7875,5.4289,2.9021,4.0976,1.1917,5.6924,2.5485,2.8266,2.1295,1.6784,5.3424,4.7064,2.244,1.7607,4.3067,0.0311,0.0019,0.1175,5.036,0.6096,6.2818,2.3705,1.1613,2.9107,0.1345,4.7553,2.7389,1.4907,0.8147,5.1206,3.6761,0.7522,0.1598,4.4687,2.9656,0.0564,2.7576,0.7241,2.3576,0.0033,0.002,0.0386,3.7552,1.8542,2.0993,0.0023,0.769,1.5411,3.8657,2.2854,5.0049,3.1885,1.9412,2.0819,2.4143,1.5868,5.3243,1.3244,2.4108,2.2363,4.6579,2.7861,3.7317,0.4227,0.0137,2.0229,4.2909,3.3926,2.9487,2.3862,5.3564,1.9594,0.217,0.5355,4.1026,2.9244,4.3729,5.9499,0.4218,1.3095,1.1423,2.6469,4.1549,2.9306,2.9391,1.1541,1.1129,4.0413,4.8365,2.6343,2.9052,4.7259,4.183,0.4433,2.7306,2.2215,6.823,2.7204,0.7109,4.5749,0.0909,2.3817,0.0065,0.0041,0.0924,5.8984,2.9158,1.7768,3.7603,2.617,2.7491,0.7722,6.8217,0.5924,5.9024,0.187,0.0035,0.0477,5.5583,0.116,0.018,3.7728,0.3448,3.9454,0.1556,0.5833,0.1198,0.2881,0.0935,1.6477,2.1728,0.5944,3.7492,3.7645,0.0045,0.0023,0.0229,2.9792,2.7035,3.3119,4.3767,1.8723,0.3855,2.717,4.1034,0.0528,2.8459,4.1173,3.6732,1.1664,2.8744,3.5506,1.5738,0.8784,4.9617,0.2507,5.5503,1.5006,5.5027,5.1739,1.7787,5.8584,2.6797,3.5241,2.1776,2.5039,3.4302,1.3203,2.7364,4.5458,1.9301,1.314,1.7943,4.6695,2.408,2.8662,4.7172,0.6412,2.6239,3.7244,1.8501,0.3704,0.5805,5.5943,3.5849,0.0024,0.002,0.012,3.224,1.1579,0.2779,2.3963,2.6489,0.0572,1.5906,3.0291,1.985,4.3463,1.1969,2.529,0.1009,1.4274,0.0023,0.0021,0.0166,3.9012,0.467,1.8859,1.0829,3.8348,4.0378,3.2649,0.0061,0.0025,0.0065,3.0968,0.0255,0.0093,0.1531,1.4554,0.4859,2.6336,0.1012,0.713,0.467,4.4833,3.1415,4.1994,2.2035,5.6328,0.0356,2.6878,2.8783,1.8505,1.2193,3.6212,2.8201,1.7627,2.6357,3.8104,1.8685,4.1511,1.3987,2.6731,3.0773,0.859,3.261,3.8119,0.0303,6.0319,0.4464,2.1728,3.6057,0.2619,0.0037,1.6646,5.7655,6.1421,3.608,5.0508,0.0129,1.3432,3.2885,2.1236,2.4801,0.803,4.8285,1.3164,0.9652,0.2925,2.8943,3.6343,1.5275,0.3959,0.0015,0.0031,0.0165,5.3585,1.7429,2.7745,1.6842,4.2207,3.3281,0.0725,0.6739,5.5408,4.7065,0.6911,5.5389,5.9149,6.3158,6.1175,2.8091,0.2459,0.0203,2.3186,3.7521,4.6078,3.1974,1.3343,0.0101,0.0062,0.0547,1.858,3.7565,1.0109,6.2168,0.0191,1.3237,2.4246,2.9686,1.1554,5.1403,0.1956,5.6471,4.8874,3.18,1.8103,0.9023,0.0013,0.0043,0.009,2.1175,0.7737,6.4551,2.3012,3.8622,1.6614,2.2906,0.4891,4.5119,1.361,0.9443,4.1071,0.04,2.0445,0.0064,0.0046,0.0092,4.2723,1.7521,2.1703,4.4869,0.142,3.0345,4.8756,0.1589,1.3978,3.093,0.6639,5.0028,0.2877,0.774,0.003,0.0016,0.0122,2.4678,1.2574,1.3435,4.3852,2.0402,0.0187,4.0507,0.4335,1.2198,4.0602,2.9006,4.5555,1.6872,3.5166,1.4658,3.2607,1.6235,6.8122,0.7056,0.0031,0.0027,0.0091,4.5913,0.002,0.4162,2.7613,2.5922,0.4838,1.7602,1.9202,4.5287,4.5575,0.3817,0.0294,2.7329,2.5328,3.7498,1.9129,0.76,5.4778,3.11,1.1032,2.5983,3.7973,0.4502,3.5459,0.1841,0.0049,0.1136,0.1151,0.0016,0.0012,3.0566,0.5118,4.56,2.3987,0.6842,1.2452,2.0226,2.454,2.8943,2.2437,5.2953,5.5954,0.0056,0.0021,0.008,3.2099,4.0612,1.7142,5.5368,0.0938,0.8774,5.4653,0.1364,2.9273,2.4409,5.3169,1.7753,2.1621,3.2485,2.9811,4.5485,2.8517,1.5225,2.4135,1.0673,3.3931,4.3516,4.3301,2.809,4.1083,0.6841,1.3979,0.9585,2.7406,2.363,0.2324,1.1661,1.3424,0.7686,3.4174,0.0962,0.3616,4.7286,0.9582,1.998,3.9513,3.5396,0.5212,0.7686,0.0031,0.0046,0.0407,4.083,0.0254,0.0165,0.5073,1.3196,0.002,5.0768,0.9055,1.3438,0.2579,3.2725,2.4402,1.1121,0.5165,4.7732,4.5628,0.8018,4.4354,3.577,2.3947,1.8063,3.0392,1.991,4.0731,0.0209,4.5623,1.2541,0.0024,0.0016,0.0099,0.4315,0.0025,0.3414]}
{"id":4322,"ended":true,"length":541,"gen_text":"In 1998, Danie Pienaar, now head of South African National Parks Scientific Services, survived the bite of a black mamba without antivenom. Although no antivenom was administered, Pienaar was in active surveillance over the ensuing weeks examining the site of the first bite. The incident was recorded because of the unusual condition of the victim. On Nov. 20, 1996, a group of scientists from a National Parks Service research group visited the site. They observed three mamba of similar size (3 and 3.8 cm long) in the middle ground and observed four specimens of black mamba on the wall. In the four new specimens, the mamba was removed with two black mambas. In the second specimen, one specimen was removed for examination, and the third specimen with a black mamba was removed for comparison with the first two. The mamba did not appear to be mated to any other living animals or any species, and no mamba died. On the third, one and two species were reported to be alive, and there was a significant difference in size between the second and third specimens during the second period. At the end of 1996, Pienaar conducted another study examining three mamba of the same size, 3.8 cm long, in a grasslands area. He found two specimens of the mamba live in various sites, and they also had two mumps (two of which were white) in them. At the conclusion of his autopsy, Dr. J.K. Rochowich of the University of Illinois in Champaign, Illinois, examined the specimen, and after three weeks of observation, he determined that two specimens of the mamba died of multiple bites during the study period. The third and last specimen the team examined had a number of missing teeth. Pienaar concluded that at least one of the specimens belonged to the African mamba, and that the third mamba died of two bites. All three young specimens had similar antivenom treatments, and all were found to have two missing teeth. In the present paper, we wish to acknowledge the efforts devoted to documenting the events that led Dr. Pienaar's team, through photographs captured on video camera and interviews with the survivors, to determine the whereabouts of a black mamba (or white mamba) as part of the investigation. We would like to commend Dr. Pienaar and the team from Dr. Pienaar's laboratory, along with Dr. Szymon J. Pienaar, of the National Parks Service for their dedication and commitment.

{"id":3571,"ended":false,"length":534,"gen_text":"The Ramanathaswamy Temple is the most notable historic landmark of the town. Located in the centre of town, Ramanathaswamy Temple is a famous Hindu temple dedicated to the god Shiva. The temple has been rebuilt in the 1970s and since then the building has risen to become one of the most iconic and revered temple in the world, although it has been vandalized to the point of not being used by any Hindu. In 2004, two days after Hindu temple was damaged, the group claimed that the attack was a protest against the killing and destruction of Hindu temples.\n\nThe Ramanathaswamy Temple in Kolkata is being restored by the new landlord, Prithiya Bhikale, who plans to build on old buildings and has announced to the court with a view to taking them over his land:\n\n\"When asked what he intends to do with the buildings, Mr. Bhikale said he was sure that they can be used as hotels for some time and that he would give permission for it to remain there. Today however, we have taken over a second project so some of the pieces won't go in there. We have given permission. We have given Mr. Bhikale permission to renovate the temple so we can have a new location when we have full opportunity to redevelop it next spring. \"\n\nIn 2011, the Ramanathaswamy Temple was renovated and then moved into the current home where it is now occupied without any loss of life. The home is believed to be the same location where the two main buildings were. The two main buildings, the Hindu Patera and Ramanathaswamy Temple, stand on the terrace of the renovated temple, offering views, and offering a glimpse into the inner workings of the original temple. It has also been painted green at the top, which has been in the process of being done.\n\nAccording to the Mahasagara Palaces, Ramanathaswamy temple is an unclaimed cultural heritage. All the original structures are in service of this cultural center and with the addition of the new building, the Vedic shrine could be built in the city's existing, unoccupied Palakkad. The Vedic shrine is believed to be located within a city that is home to temples.\n\nRamanathaswamy Temple is one of the oldest Hindu temples in modern history and has been in operation for 2 years. Recently a new building has been constructed to house its current and historic function, the Bharat Nagar. As a community owned Christian religion, it is very strong. In 2006, people from the Mahaagara Palaces visited the holy site and started to pray that there would be a new temple built, to mark our Lord's Holiness's time. Today this building is one of the oldest Christian temples in the world and there was much love in the streets of India for this holy spot\n\nAlso posted at:\n\n12 Most Holy Places For Hindus to Visit, May 10th 2015","token_len":619,"entropy":[10.3731,3.3142,2.5453,4.0048,4.924,0.1096,5.1222,2.4532,2.3939,3.2102,5.1872,6.5611,3.3755,1.8612,1.2145,4.9251,0.8121,3.9119,1.0773,0.7929,3.527,0.0298,3.1231,0.4844,2.9149,0.0964,0.0126,0.0486,0.0107,0.0006,0.6314,0.8209,1.8815,5.4694,2.7522,0.4956,3.3656,0.0545,1.0248,2.8469,1.5699,0.5779,1.7161,1.3009,2.2781,0.8553,5.1432,2.2283,1.1661,3.9174,0.1527,1.1393,6.0301,0.3831,2.0816,3.0525,0.1842,6.2097,0.8976,1.5221,0.7023,0.0062,0.2121,0.9019,3.2974,3.1725,3.2249,4.0209,1.1374,0.8543,1.0283,3.6019,5.9985,1.3378,1.2593,1.693,3.343,1.8883,5.7913,0.822,0.4903,0.9188,4.3284,0.3127,4.3552,2.5456,1.7178,1.649,1.7434,3.4604,4.064,0.6499,4.5005,5.5403,0.3071,5.5544,3.4812,1.044,2.7049,0.9498,1.6064,5.9043,5.488,0.9085,1.0994,4.4734,0.8343,1.829,5.1102,0.4689,0.6499,5.5307,3.9111,1.6702,0.0465,2.3438,0.8607,0.901,1.4083,0.0061,1.8813,1.7507,0.0801,0.0358,0.0226,0.0063,0.0022,0.2082,3.0263,4.207,1.0439,0.0001,1.8974,6.1169,3.3572,2.6139,1.0106,5.5162,5.9733,1.6339,4.9961,2.8845,5.7514,4.2714,4.9959,4.4777,1.2153,1.0145,5.1627,0.0721,1.8817,4.9313,6.0201,2.2937,1.7701,5.305,5.2415,3.7792,3.4958,5.2256,6.9455,1.5046,2.8198,0.0796,4.3965,6.0574,0.996,5.1159,2.234,6.487,0.5779,0.0002,0.7373,4.4721,5.4917,2.7316,1.5946,3.0461,0.0182,0.1991,0.5202,0.3895,3.8887,0.8488,3.3467,0.6845,0.3836,0.0111,0.0293,0.8498,2.2495,3.6198,5.5819,1.4951,1.8362,4.6509,0.3205,3.2523,1.5445,5.6606,2.8152,5.0818,0.6994,2.0109,1.1538,1.112,0.9175,3.591,3.8185,1.1533,2.8831,0.5354,3.3226,2.3475,0.8909,6.3269,5.2837,0.193,3.1891,1.3505,4.1051,0.94,3.3074,5.6133,5.5851,5.7066,7.9329,0.9775,0.2176,5.8754,5.9004,0.0017,3.5998,2.6495,2.8342,0.9707,1.5676,1.6783,4.3057,0.8018,4.5582,1.4459,1.4333,3.0695,4.5425,0.0088,0.1166,0.0041,0.0075,1.0819,0.191,4.7158,0.0007,0.6466,3.2199,3.8004,2.0972,0.4088,2.7162,1.4569,2.8442,3.9157,6.2678,1.3369,1.7627,6.0286,5.8047,1.1567,4.8163,0.507,6.4538,5.0327,0.5562,3.552,3.3752,0.0002,2.8892,4.3224,0.2317,1.1608,2.7312,0.0324,0.0204,0.0218,0.0024,0.001,0.2201,0.6368,4.5782,1.5295,5.1918,3.9606,2.2633,1.1132,5.6533,3.2976,4.0623,0.5675,1.3079,0.8756,4.0558,6.8212,0.9661,4.3433,0.3605,2.6132,0.3809,1.6894,4.9879,1.4458,5.72,0.0266,0.6127,1.9093,4.1757,4.3509,1.0961,0.6758,4.4128,4.3739,3.0476,1.659,4.6646,1.8402,3.8083,1.0561,0.638,2.5352,1.1155,3.4825,5.7489,5.1955,1.7453,0.8966,2.9164,0.3783,0.1647,0.1672,0.0048,0.0035,0.269,0.3978,5.2812,1.6374,1.2396,5.7364,0.1488,0.6423,0.3001,5.694,3.6426,2.2875,6.2409,2.1759,5.1077,2.7188,5.9748,1.8152,3.5022,0.6924,0.3143,4.2004,0.9971,0.0489,0.2762,5.1658,1.3891,0.3557,3.7915,2.4375,1.844,0.4532,5.0208,2.8202,5.8735,0.6325,1.7714,2.0327,2.9991,2.5045,1.1068,4.1862,2.912,3.0395,0.0262,0.3603,5.4856,2.0438,0.709,0.0002,3.9983,0.0036,1.1058,5.7275,2.2012,5.7417,1.0496,1.7117,1.5967,2.4611,0.0158,0.0172,0.0211,0.0016,0.0004,3.3609,1.1434,3.6103,5.0803,2.4097,5.1445,1.3241,2.4994,5.3178,1.9994,3.6388,2.7649,2.3078,2.374,5.0189,0.4181,3.5818,4.1403,6.4969,1.6305,5.8234,0.8544,4.0084,0.0161,1.1951,1.5956,1.9506,0.5962,1.2001,6.0359,1.2623,5.4149,5.3238,0.9989,2.8514,2.1917,1.0683,3.9951,3.3663,4.8504,5.2081,3.7543,1.4614,5.4444,3.1128,0.611,0.3044,2.6833,1.8217,3.8423,0.1179,0.9499,1.2543,3.8363,0.0348,0.7708,2.9051,3.4078,2.0247,4.5983,3.1571,1.3126,3.4281,0.0045,4.888,2.6204,1.1077,0.0002,4.557,1.1253,0.086,0.0838,0.0025,0.0007,0.5653,1.3149,3.1514,0.0228,0.4612,1.5002,1.2895,0.3046,0.3101,7.0929,1.8338,1.5743,1.9238,0.5723,2.3509,1.6951,0.7815,4.8651,4.7763,0.6766,5.6173,3.4589,2.8584,1.2952,2.118,0.1044,1.3314,2.3341,1.7999,3.3216,4.4663,3.7861,5.0688,4.1756,2.051,1.9935,5.5462,0.4396,4.344,0.0728,2.4072,4.646,2.4372,5.0973,6.0086,6.4615,5.2927,0.519,2.0072,0.8967,4.3283,5.995,2.2786,3.1122,4.7076,0.3471,6.1549,1.5046,1.476,4.3177,3.0142,3.2977,0.1257,0.0255,3.397,0.4515,4.9541,1.4152,1.0021,4.2154,1.9761,1.7197,4.2988,3.3656,0.9746,0.1828,0.802,1.4816,1.3813,1.2812,4.0348,3.8396,3.6591,6.0179,4.9489,0.3423,4.8413,0.0088,0.8103,4.383,1.1182,3.4222,4.4299,3.2979,0.6461,3.8994,0.0193,0.211,1.3901,3.7457,0.7347,0.1444,0.6947,0.3611,1.2455,4.454,4.273,3.8865,3.2166,3.9501,0.467,4.6688,1.527,4.4348,1.3205,2.1062,3.0236,2.8182,7.9419,0.0002,5.3157,5.6453,2.5348,1.2111,1.0663,0.0002,5.5479,5.8011,3.6646,1.1754,5.3994,2.2245,2.4679,0.795,3.8868,3.8213,4.3483,2.1002,3.7834]}
{"id":1620,"ended":false,"length":565,"gen_text":"Aerith's character has appeared in several games outside of the Final Fantasy VII continuity. In Final Fantasy Tactics, she appears as a flower girl ; when a group of criminals harasses her, she makes one that she can be taken down.[4] During the Final Fantasy VII continuity, she was mentioned as the sister of Rinoa and has a dream-like appearance.\n\nCharacteristics Edit\n\nBard is an incredibly versatile fighter who was once called a'saber-raider' before he was transformed into a bard, and still does so at times. He is also a leader in the Battle Royale series. His training has always been a joy, but he doesn't fight very often due to his lack of discipline, since he is highly focused on one skill, attack. If he fails or fails at attacking with any skill, he is forced to be the first one to pick up some weapons.\n\nThis makes for an especially impressive character. He is capable of fighting any type of opponent, and there are many reasons why he has taken to such a fearsome style.\n\nAt first, he fights mainly against the weaker enemies in the game, and when he eventually learns from those who already know him well enough to recognize him quickly, he often won't hesitate to attempt a counterattack. However, even after hearing some of the best strategies for the match, he only uses one or two of the combos to avoid enemies, making him the best fighter at both the beginning and the end due to the lack of support he receives from most enemies.\n\nIn the Final Fantasy VII storyline, Bard will occasionally be seen fighting two different groups of criminals, including Rinoa and Nog from Final Fantasy VII, and as a part of the battle, you have a chance to confront them by confronting him on his own volition, which is where the two sides will agree to meet up. The fight is eventually put to a final head-to-head at the beginning of the battle, where Rinoa can return to her normal form where she will fight one of the criminals, who will be seen by you as a bard alongside her rival, who will become a stronger version of herself at the end of the match.\n\nIn Final Fantasy VII Advance 2, Bard was replaced by Thaddeus, a fighter who had originally been named Lax. Thaddeus is actually the first fighter to be given the name Naga, which implies that Lax is the first to gain the designation of 'Naga.' This may not be the case with Thaddeus as he is the only new character not yet in the game who can fight at the same time. Thaddeus is actually shown fighting Nagamaki, the main antagonist of Final Fantasy VII, who has two attacks: one for Naga and one for Bard.\n\nIn Final Fantasy Online, Bard can be used for \"Barding Up\" by using his new name. This is the only time it is unlocked and no special character will be added in the game.\n\nReferences Edit","token_len":620,"entropy":[7.8449,7.3974,3.9462,6.8621,3.1113,5.4685,0.5754,2.1312,3.7659,8.2304,0.1076,1.7723,4.9833,0.0058,5.2889,5.3121,0.9654,2.5325,2.9971,0.0022,3.6489,0.6579,1.6291,2.5379,1.0602,0.7188,7.3133,4.8287,11.5897,5.2226,3.9834,3.3626,0.1217,7.9572,7.5461,7.8619,1.4241,0.7646,0.4128,4.8055,5.1372,5.7338,2.5524,1.6265,3.7438,4.3629,2.1958,6.0018,2.7945,0.1065,5.4686,0.6871,2.0611,0.0198,0.9423,3.1052,0.2023,0.8045,1.8377,4.0513,1.6359,1.9264,4.4115,0.0808,4.5579,1.026,2.315,5.3553,2.2419,5.2049,4.3343,0.0623,1.6555,1.042,0.8632,0.0003,4.9617,1.9137,0.7042,0.0017,0.0002,5.484,3.4454,3.0231,2.4723,4.0789,4.7941,1.7745,2.3643,4.8128,3.2428,4.2001,1.5081,11.1521,5.8218,3.5902,5.8588,0.6422,9.4509,6.4897,2.357,1.1117,3.5111,0.2333,0.4066,3.5396,0.4052,2.5138,1.8967,5.0128,3.5067,0.9996,3.3006,3.091,0.596,1.6502,0.9882,2.359,1.8809,5.1267,2.0908,0.7857,3.9654,2.9748,3.4009,1.9469,2.4012,5.3099,2.5333,4.1752,0.3015,2.5369,5.1112,1.4486,2.9289,1.331,5.5579,0.0013,5.3669,3.502,0.8424,2.5424,0.0061,0.6182,2.8405,0.002,5.9397,1.9739,4.7977,0.5415,1.5594,5.4588,3.7285,0.3727,4.4956,4.6285,1.8877,6.1582,0.9313,5.7693,1.0686,3.6023,4.3308,2.0847,2.7336,5.2975,3.9771,2.9059,2.0349,0.4113,0.394,2.1839,2.9923,0.0881,4.7674,3.6621,2.4214,1.5361,0.2433,5.0413,0.5563,5.4029,4.2335,1.5932,1.637,0.0002,5.5973,3.1601,4.092,1.8971,5.3169,5.0695,2.865,1.6268,1.5855,0.926,3.5891,0.0273,3.2401,3.2698,1.8277,0.0145,2.3541,1.0264,1.4547,5.8056,0.6955,1.6524,4.6792,0.7467,0.8266,3.2356,5.5358,1.242,4.2604,0.358,4.7078,2.0604,0.7985,2.456,0.0002,5.3859,1.2815,0.6011,0.9524,5.204,5.1815,2.2782,2.0113,4.7667,3.133,2.6069,0.4887,1.7089,0.8785,2.2208,3.9976,0.902,5.9789,4.1977,5.9294,4.1085,1.9333,5.8741,0.91,0.8132,1.7858,1.8705,0.4361,4.3549,0.8039,6.8333,0.3757,0.2059,4.7266,5.5811,0.2462,2.2689,0.1056,5.8048,1.5479,3.1736,0.4942,0.7629,1.9384,0.031,4.1563,2.3071,6.1592,4.019,0.4742,1.042,4.1327,4.5782,3.0557,3.2932,4.4661,0.3908,0.518,5.3093,2.7512,1.3413,2.5432,0.0509,1.76,2.8928,5.6787,2.7316,3.568,6.0029,1.6427,3.8835,0.6298,3.1871,2.6183,2.2494,3.7249,5.3918,1.5402,2.5563,0.0667,0.5437,0.1122,6.4474,0.0091,2.507,3.0157,0.0016,5.4726,1.7412,1.5331,0.976,4.9525,2.8105,0.318,0.9402,0.0002,2.6082,1.2486,2.1073,0.005,0.5681,3.8923,0.1427,2.139,3.8941,3.109,2.3888,0.9965,1.467,5.5137,2.5368,4.4705,0.2526,2.8411,1.367,3.9256,2.8143,0.0094,0.7588,4.9367,4.9298,4.3879,1.6632,0.0044,0.6249,2.3948,2.0072,4.8328,1.458,4.034,0.0097,0.8753,2.6124,1.2856,6.2993,3.8109,3.0598,0.2851,0.0215,5.4586,1.4727,4.2449,4.2787,2.2013,3.2688,2.3385,0.7897,6.4575,0.0005,2.0615,2.5324,1.4928,4.4844,1.8428,3.6188,3.8526,1.9207,5.5537,0.7123,2.6733,2.6252,0.6397,3.3565,3.3673,1.5261,5.3033,5.474,1.1358,0.5978,3.4087,4.7151,0.2721,0.634,0.0012,0.0241,4.2508,0.7245,3.4634,0.3218,0.176,2.7218,0.5958,2.3748,2.262,0.0016,4.3351,5.9469,0.4555,0.9356,2.8303,1.1916,6.1902,0.3974,2.641,2.5456,4.6574,0.4253,0.3719,0.4785,1.8193,2.6417,1.1704,2.0247,5.6605,3.5224,4.1458,1.3359,1.0606,4.094,0.0146,6.343,2.0639,4.6191,1.428,2.8376,0.8809,4.225,1.3434,4.8018,1.9595,0.0184,1.3806,4.884,0.4583,0.2612,0.5162,0.0818,2.8473,0.1992,0.6844,0.0002,2.0228,1.5344,0.0023,0.7673,6.498,5.6185,0.2898,0.8249,3.0352,5.0625,0.2745,5.9872,3.0656,0.032,1.5092,1.6458,5.1143,1.1466,3.1385,4.486,0.7539,2.686,5.3073,4.0804,2.488,2.7208,0.0028,0.0002,1.871,5.0373,2.2298,3.196,2.8047,0.8968,1.7252,3.3687,0.8676,1.3224,6.0939,3.4888,1.2911,2.1817,5.0291,0.4587,3.7938,0.0028,1.31,1.7553,2.1139,2.3455,5.1433,0.993,5.2728,1.5826,4.0192,1.7494,0.114,3.6587,3.1069,3.8383,4.0273,0.688,1.3288,0.4546,3.5451,2.5993,0.0104,0.0003,2.8422,1.007,1.423,2.3769,1.0639,6.0783,1.4545,5.9132,4.1037,2.8514,0.6009,0.6662,2.9331,2.8598,3.641,3.766,1.5048,1.2511,0.4422,1.3805,3.8279,0.0113,0.0002,1.5357,3.9075,5.6801,2.3639,9.4484,5.2077,3.6301,1.5368,1.5378,3.5553,0.9138,0.4188,0.7129,0.0015,0.1057,1.7484,2.6285,2.6433,5.6731,4.263,2.4689,1.279,3.9824,4.0346,0.0131,0.566,0.4341,0.1489,1.8553,0.448,0.9365,0.0002,1.4334,0.9769,0.0027,4.6689,0.3607,0.8576,2.6243,0.656,3.0503,3.6188,5.7389,3.8396,5.6897,4.6628,0.7377,2.8414,2.1855,1.5699,5.1008,4.1953,2.3185,2.0608,1.5389,2.4773,0.8232,1.0137,3.9938,0.618,5.7017,3.141,5.934,4.1444,4.1662,2.897,0.7595,3.6954,3.4227,0.9096,0.4294,0.5674,0.5014,0.0002,5.7483,0.0074]}

{"id":2809,"ended":false,"length":579,"gen_text":"Chakotay's inclusion in the main cast of Voyager was seen by critics as one of several who was used to highlight the diversity within the series. This was highlighted during the episode ``The Return of the Mummy'' where Chakotay, who was featured as a female-dominated member of the crew, did not take any cues from the original series to be a male member of the crew and instead became an inter-racial sex symbol. According to some critics, this was because the entire cast had not yet been revealed and Chakotay had to settle for a role of a female. In the episode ``The Return of the Mummy,'' which was originally intended as an ending to the main series but later moved on to a new ending, Chakotay was mentioned twice before, briefly: in ``The Return of Martha''. As a result of the fact that both the audience and the audience thought that this was an excellent ending, it was considered fitting for some to refer to the episode as \"the last part'' of the episode using Klingon terminology, thereby making a statement about Klingons that the series should stay with Klingons. Also, while in this case the audience and audience assumed that this was some sort of a joke, it was never meant to be that way. In particular, the use of the word \"Klingon\"\" by the audience which was so prevalent in the series became known as the \"Klingon joke.\"\n\nwas used by the audience which was so prevalent in the series became known as the \"Klingon joke.\" For that reason as well, the episode was shortened from \"Caretakers'' to \"The Last of The Tehara'' during the first half of season 1 and as a result, it had become a full-length drama in this part of Voyager. After the return of the Mummy in season two, the episode became a live-action movie which was then released on DVD. On screen, however, the movie had different visual effects by different studios; the original Mummy was used for the first time with the addition of the Klingon's, while during the second half of season one the cast used the Klingon's not for the first time. The Klingon's were made entirely of green plastic, and used in some scenes. The only noticeable difference between this episode and the original one is that there were no Klingons in those scenes and the Klingons had already left the ship.\n\nwas used for the first time with the addition of the Klingons, while during the second half of season one the cast used the Klingon's not for the first time.

Since there was no visible reference to the Mummy, \"The Return of the Mummy\" was not a reference to the original series, despite being one of several short non-original episodes in the series.\n\nReferences Edit","token_len":622,"entropy":[6.8439,4.1611,1.2284,4.2535,8.4426,1.4678,0.6496,6.3714,2.5353,1.3509,7.3949,2.2906,4.8072,2.364,3.044,0.4121,3.9685,0.0967,5.5717,6.6771,5.6664,7.0982,0.9194,6.8374,0.9274,4.969,4.108,0.3697,3.2714,0.6643,3.9251,1.7394,5.1793,3.3211,0.8659,4.1514,10.0428,2.0347,5.8506,0.3108,1.5158,5.6165,2.8361,1.3839,1.1325,1.1314,0.0002,0.0003,3.3986,2.9399,1.2454,4.8276,1.2413,0.9347,3.7778,4.7432,2.346,3.4821,0.1047,0.4648,1.2478,0.2441,5.818,0.492,3.9673,2.9271,4.2452,0.0142,1.2551,5.0709,2.8613,4.4485,3.1415,2.443,4.267,2.2178,0.6033,0.2266,0.5761,3.0219,1.8783,3.287,2.5139,4.3261,3.6698,2.2576,5.627,0.6424,0.5633,5.8596,0.0016,4.1658,0.7958,0.2181,1.4247,1.479,2.9767,1.8049,5.3397,1.1179,3.3553,4.3531,1.7438,1.3711,4.1814,2.4767,2.3835,0.001,0.0008,2.4406,2.5273,5.7779,0.2835,1.4172,3.401,1.4855,1.2645,2.0418,1.6689,3.2331,1.8318,1.1911,0.7148,1.0515,1.6584,0.025,0.1589,0.2249,0.0007,1.2258,3.3071,1.2222,3.1486,3.0064,2.1001,1.9965,4.8322,0.9953,0.3624,3.7584,0.5739,2.7837,3.1589,4.2736,2.7233,0.3759,2.0682,2.4201,2.9351,0.612,1.1494,0.0013,0.0013,1.6453,4.123,4.3897,3.5752,2.3636,5.864,5.3858,1.5885,2.8977,0.7076,1.5829,0.0395,7.5359,8.1788,4.7087,1.8072,0.5361,0.9531,1.6209,3.282,0.0454,4.7657,2.0887,5.837,0.1335,0.8103,2.9644,5.8387,1.1121,3.1213,0.6726,2.4676,4.0008,0.8426,1.0184,1.9381,0.5824,4.1986,5.9965,1.1675,5.778,1.5819,4.3139,0.1463,1.5089,1.6988,0.4574,3.545,1.8072,2.8888,5.1562,3.5067,0.3769,0.2885,3.3296,7.0357,6.9132,2.9243,2.5126,5.4596,2.8452,3.4413,3.1865,1.2323,4.9979,0.1517,3.2337,3.1156,3.4685,3.838,5.2311,3.0207,4.0073,0.0869,0.8733,5.3192,0.5556,3.8146,3.6542,3.1665,2.6706,1.4649,1.7166,3.2847,2.2477,3.845,0.1875,1.8337,0.2494,5.7694,0.8557,0.0006,3.5327,2.6745,0.5177,1.5354,0.7523,4.3075,3.4121,0.42,0.3856,3.3601,0.1122,0.4567,2.1813,4.3193,0.0578,1.2781,4.2914,0.0153,0.8885,1.5269,0.9878,2.5646,0.0885,0.0828,6.9152,4.352,1.1806,1.1617,5.9693,1.342,5.0728,3.4429,0.9723,0.4118,2.4666,5.433,4.7439,0.7804,1.2308,1.296,0.7053,0.1102,0.1211,4.0085,1.6839,2.0259,0.013,6.4498,3.5509,0.3696,0.6128,0.0164,0.0104,0.0048,0.0016,0.0156,0.002,0.0025,0.0012,0.0088,0.0001,0.001,0.0059,0.0187,0.0072,0.0012,0.0005,0.0466,0.0349,5.1903,5.8842,0.5916,7.3191,1.1436,1.1237,1.5297,2.5503,1.4715,5.1974,2.1628,2.048,5.351,4.7509,4.2502,1.6509,0.3669,0.6639,2.413,4.6558,2.6519,3.6084,5.6247,4.6997,4.6528,2.8734,4.4616,0.6768,3.354,1.7634,0.0766,3.6908,3.1661,2.6046,4.1646,1.0395,0.2013,1.3095,2.0737,3.4119,3.6367,1.6873,5.256,0.5911,1.7894,4.235,3.1258,4.5481,4.1923,0.4809,2.97,0.4931,5.1912,0.9341,4.0393,0.074,0.829,0.9562,0.1408,3.3724,1.8486,2.6622,0.1723,1.1248,2.1686,2.945,0.9781,5.7264,0.3083,0.0022,2.8316,3.6014,1.2218,4.1392,2.4669,1.3436,0.3462,1.5714,4.5543,5.612,0.7061,3.9648,0.0035,0.9111,2.8998,2.7738,5.8444,4.1845,0.5536,5.5642,2.74,1.35,4.7633,1.9408,3.1831,4.6168,0.9911,1.6618,3.7085,2.435,0.8956,1.7485,0.4585,4.0923,1.3029,3.9423,0.006,1.7063,3.0825,5.7918,4.5989,2.2692,5.8639,0.3257,0.7595,0.2741,0.2162,1.1094,1.396,1.6816,4.2929,2.2166,1.053,1.0957,0.5936,6.3893,2.1979,0.3611,0.3244,0.0164,0.993,1.8995,3.1959,0.8317,0.8579,5.259,5.2962,1.5213,5.384,3.1921,1.3479,1.8773,4.8118,1.7642,4.4409,1.3348,3.3202,1.5024,4.081,4.4477,0.9192,0.8041,2.9654,3.9058,0.1211,0.5191,1.2263,4.1932,1.2735,0.5024,3.339,1.4427,0.7874,2.3873,0.0436,1.2729,6.3008,0.2557,2.5243,1.4334,2.2688,0.0174,3.3458,3.9829,4.1416,0.7461,1.4144,1.1499,1.5116,0.0002,1.6192,0.0186,0.0196,0.0028,0.0022,0.0005,0.0027,0.0023,0.0031,0.001,0.003,2.1334,0.0048,0.013,0.0081,0.0092,0.0029,0.0086,0.0036,0.0004,0.001,0.0275,0.0039,0.0108,0.0096,0.0031,0.1055,0.0015,0.1505,0.0014,0.0017,0.001,0.0004,0.0071,0.1977,0.2747,0.0025,0.6576,0.0047,4.2228,0.0021,0.0019,0.0013,0.0007,0.0028,0.0017,0.0031,0.0019,0.0002,0.0008,0.0187,0.0002,0.0091,0.0034,0.0006,0.0064,0.0011,0.0016,0.0017,0.0064,0.0005,0.0004,0.0005,0.0001,0.0137,0.0049,0.0004,0.0061,0.0013,0.0014,0.0003,0.0033,0.0015,0.0033,0.0033,0.0014,0.0018,0.0026,0.0027,0.0014,0.0007,5.4178,3.1888,1.2711,0.5763,5.1632,4.8099,0.2139,0.9231,2.931,0.0775,1.8383,5.6162,0.7433,0.749,0.0403,0.6427,0.0893,0.0006,0.3047,0.8533,2.5214,2.9616,2.2317,0.0686,0.4838,1.7081,1.1239,1.9744,4.2735,2.1564,3.2815,0.0437,2.884,5.1202,6.0168,0.0348,4.0597,2.1493,1.9665,0.452,0.6426,1.0061,1.1588,0.0002,4.8745,0.2425]}
{"id":4566,"ended":false,"length":552,"gen_text":"When the contracts were announced, Alyeska already had 12 pipeline construction camps either built or under construction. These camps were all north of the Yukon, however, and camps had to be built where they could provide more housing. The camps were generally only 5-15 meters away because of the long distance between the camps. On the previous day the new gas pipeline in the east of the country was launched into the northern sector and was fully operational. According to estimates, the pipeline would deliver 3 million metric tons of gas in just a few hours, and this gas flow was used to power the pipeline.\n\nToday's pipeline is being expanded by natural gas from various sources: natural gas from the tar sands; hydropower from fracking operations; natural gas from Alberta with an average daily use of 500,000 cubic metres; and liquefied natural gas extracted from natural gas extraction. The most important natural gas source with use is hydrocarbons. The use of hydrocarbons results in the release of low carbon dioxide, higher energy efficiency, a cleaner environment, and reduce reliance on natural gas.\n\nNatural gas production in the southern sector of the country is about 8 billion metric tons a year. As of 2013, natural gas production from the Alberta tar sands has grown by 4.1 billion metric tons a year.\n\nIn the first quarter of this year, the Yukon will have only 2.8% natural gas production. At the same time production in the northeastern and eastern sectors is 4.2 billion metric tons. Of these 2.8 billion metric tons that will be produced, the Yukon is projected to produce around 7 to 10 billion metric tons of natural gas in 2017. Currently, natural gas production in the southwestern and western sectors is 6.7 billion metric tons, as noted above. The total gas demand in the Yukon has been in the 4-5 million metric tons category that are assumed to be in the pipeline.\n\nIf natural gas is allowed on Canadian territory, there will be a small demand for natural gas. There is little to show with regards to price, which will depend upon any price negotiation. The price in the Yukon will generally be somewhere around $2 to $5 \/ litre, less than $12 per litre or $16.50 to about $26.\n\nThe Yukon is one of the few nations in the world where the natural gas is produced at below the average retail price, the average retail price is about.10 cents to.50 cents per kilogram.\n\nThe Yukon is quite competitive against the American oil and gas production in the Canadian market. In fact, the average annual natural gas production is approximately 0.5 million liter and production of more than 8.8 million liters is only about a two-thirds of all Canada's gas production.\n\nNatural gas is produced from a variety of sources including hydrocarbons, hydrocarbons extracted from natural gas extraction, natural gas from the Northern Saskatchewan tar sands, and liquefied natural gas extracted from fracking operations.\n\nReferences :","token_len":623,"entropy":[2.5591,10.3176,1.0574,4.0624,0.5501,11.6784,4.4146,1.5541,9.0827,0.7254,6.582,12.0818,5.567,7.1276,9.0594,4.6619,0.6482,2.4161,0.0625,1.1977,4.224,1.0706,1.1376,3.7118,8.5891,0.0913,0.8873,6.2973,0.013,2.1497,6.6809,0.4026,1.059,8.8183,3.706,2.062,0.1489,1.1071,4.9189,2.412,0.9109,4.2972,4.7508,4.3977,1.508,2.3583,2.5269,0.848,5.3066,5.4615,5.7207,1.7642,3.133,3.322,3.8556,7.4316,1.009,0.6442,4.3027,1.2582,1.4749,0.9015,0.3782,1.1676,4.9523,1.3017,6.0049,2.4033,3.3033,5.1685,6.0021,0.8586,4.9106,1.0545,4.9744,1.7468,0.4958,2.8568,0.8348,5.3711,4.4749,0.7667,4.491,5.0394,3.0948,2.4023,4.8798,0.511,0.7442,5.4957,0.0014,5.1475,0.8999,1.571,2.2384,1.1068,2.8316,4.1209,1.6391,3.4904,0.0522,0.1523,1.5352,3.2395,2.7631,2.6546,0.5047,1.5035,1.9604,2.142,3.3329,4.0377,5.9842,2.2004,5.4581,0.4737,1.299,0.6619,2.5608,0.955,1.309,0.0319,5.1168,3.2332,1.7805,1.2162,3.2197,4.7717,2.6718,6.0706,0.0152,3.0386,5.2474,0.3861,3.4258,2.177,0.0296,0.8944,1.2116,4.2607,0.012,4.3365,5.5219,0.0374,0.0066,0.3033,4.8326,2.5921,0.6727,2.2811,0.0122,0.2139,4.85,6.1866,3.7725,2.0543,3.2882,3.3076,0.0598,4.9041,1.9273,0.006,1.3439,2.5344,1.4207,0.7378,3.5639,0.0836,0.0119,0.05,0.0022,5.2213,0.1597,2.9709,0.0901,4.0113,1.6965,1.7322,4.7898,1.611,3.0629,0.0108,1.4832,5.802,5.6386,0.8856,1.9714,1.0215,0.0003,1.981,1.9891,4.8004,0.0293,0.3729,0.1598,0.0002,6.4726,0.1336,2.4985,2.577,0.02,5.9493,2.8854,1.9485,1.8409,5.8428,2.3599,0.6016,0.3628,4.6125,3.7106,0.7376,0.4299,0.6544,5.4913,4.6459,0.0263,3.358,0.1064,0.8062,1.3718,0.0002,2.8537,0.0592,3.1094,1.8555,0.8831,5.7623,1.6897,1.483,0.3781,0.2904,1.1136,3.699,4.0767,2.6253,1.6375,0.0434,2.3204,0.201,0.7208,4.0371,1.5802,2.8007,0.3238,1.6406,0.0026,0.4445,3.4274,1.2057,5.2116,0.8874,0.0056,3.045,2.6573,1.4429,4.0164,0.8374,3.1859,0.1993,0.0917,0.0048,1.3053,0.0111,0.8674,2.1929,0.0002,2.8731,1.7395,4.4215,2.1877,0.079,2.0636,0.0126,0.3647,1.3224,3.8321,0.0032,4.123,2.046,5.3654,3.178,0.8231,2.5703,5.0172,2.2705,0.0018,0.8481,1.2153,4.4963,0.7159,0.5356,0.0162,5.2485,2.0086,0.2308,5.083,3.8518,2.5492,1.1498,2.5534,4.8365,0.2123,2.1012,0.7442,0.0537,0.003,1.4956,5.414,1.9527,0.9247,0.0918,0.182,0.0306,0.1348,0.0054,6.5371,1.0898,0.3341,1.6217,1.2003,1.8503,1.282,0.0015,1.9679,3.8567,0.0279,1.6998,3.4054,3.4188,4.9161,2.0493,0.5888,0.0457,0.0021,0.7166,0.3712,0.0007,2.4234,2.6524,0.3527,6.1571,0.4773,2.1165,0.0017,0.5874,1.0957,0.2624,5.2067,1.5964,1.2487,0.5299,0.6385,3.4683,0.3547,2.2167,0.0728,0.0079,0.0019,2.0196,4.7309,6.1343,1.1007,0.2114,2.4337,2.9039,3.6554,3.6736,1.0536,0.3828,0.5333,0.001,3.8875,1.3965,4.4814,0.5783,3.7163,1.4182,1.235,1.871,0.7978,0.3388,5.2234,5.2678,2.36,5.264,0.4067,0.2886,2.9817,0.8106,2.5303,1.0564,0.6335,0.0002,5.104,1.8017,0.0013,1.5493,5.1171,4.652,4.9553,2.9505,0.5033,3.2482,0.6765,0.2154,1.5666,4.6616,4.5137,0.6337,1.3248,0.0033,2.3983,4.0816,1.1696,3.7748,2.5117,4.4225,4.9624,2.4483,0.0107,6.051,2.2063,3.5595,2.3419,2.0057,3.0514,6.6222,3.2582,4.9461,1.1319,1.8598,2.141,3.9192,0.9086,1.8057,0.0013,1.568,5.5383,0.4564,5.6339,1.7668,0.5291,3.1853,2.5351,0.0765,2.0231,6.5177,1.6562,0.0375,1.5419,6.3763,0.3126,2.4472,5.1491,1.8356,0.3346,0.0001,2.9114,1.4306,3.3571,2.3502,1.4804,1.5568,5.7937,0.0339,4.2683,0.6139,4.1337,0.0002,1.9659,2.4333,0.0027,1.5143,3.7385,0.0208,0.6288,1.8623,3.5713,0.9168,0.2623,0.0658,2.1931,1.8482,3.2414,0.0091,2.6883,2.8371,2.8412,3.8319,1.966,3.8325,6.0699,0.2787,2.584,4.5644,2.7702,2.1216,0.2254,1.7435,1.656,8.8332,8.6546,1.0399,3.363,8.8755,4.0554,0.0784,0.5987,2.8475,0.4018,1.3499,2.0902,0.0002,1.9344,2.1234,0.0017,1.0248,6.2758,3.7586,4.7528,1.2856,5.1609,5.3099,0.5735,0.0441,4.886,2.1582,1.2457,3.8756,1.2823,0.6612,2.4341,2.3356,0.1268,1.435,3.4087,3.9973,3.1192,0.0039,0.9084,1.8908,4.4225,4.8404,0.0188,2.0459,0.8828,7.8824,3.4622,4.9544,2.9543,4.7092,0.0235,3.9021,2.2607,2.7431,0.0422,0.389,0.324,1.2253,5.5158,1.5965,3.6429,6.2435,1.0358,1.6789,0.2667,5.3696,5.3181,0.1624,3.0393,1.0031,0.1493,0.9852,0.0002,2.3586,0.0316,1.5668,2.753,2.0802,2.8714,1.1852,0.0025,0.1679,1.9074,2.1289,0.3331,0.0002,0.4872,2.2018,0.7184,0.0005,2.3522,0.1083,1.6856,0.0072,0.8071,0.4462,2.3347,0.0069,1.6797,2.2661,5.9403,3.1424,1.9705,0.0067,0.4147,1.4089,2.6441,0.0036,0.0188,0.0147,0.0019,1.1443,0.0169,4.0348,0.1627,0.1215,1.1718,0.0002,5.8818,5.4863]}
{"id":435,"ended":true,"length":564,"gen_text":"The island of Ireland fields a single international team in most sports. One notable exception to this is association football, although both associations continued to field international teams under the name `` Ireland'' since the mid-seventies.\nIt is interesting to note how these teams did not play in the Rugby Football League, although those leagues did, and that in the time since its creation, have fielded other international teams that did play football. \u00a0There are also some parallels between the league and Australia's own cricket, and the Irish association team at Victoria Street was not the only international team to play in Australia's domestic cricket league. The first American team (for USA cricket ) to play in their league was the San Jose Sharks (\u00a0for\u00a0Australia) with\u00a0Dwayne Bowe, an Australian, being a member of the team.\nWhile the San Jose Sharks has played in the AFL, some clubs use AFL internationals, which is unusual in the AFL, considering the history of AFL clubs. As part of their international team they played in the Sydney Swans, and so some of the other teams played AFL in Australia. Interestingly, while in the same league, the other teams that used AFL in AFL did not play cricket, as the American Australian Premier Club (AAPC) did use cricket in the AFL.\nIn 2011, the Australian Football League (AFC) released their inaugural international team under the name \"'Australian Football League ', which was a bit of a misnomer due to the name of\u00a0the AFL. When asked about that name as they had never done\u00a0that before,\u00a0 the team's manager\u00a0 said,\u00a0 \"It\u00a0doesn't \u00a0mean you are Australian, it only means the team is Australian \". In 2013, their American Australian Football League team name came out. One of the first things their name did was \u00a0behead a player on the field, where an international football team from Australia had just been defeated by an American team from\u00a0 Northampton. In other words, this team\u00a0was considered one of the most\u00a0non-US-grown teams for the past half century.\nThis story\u00a0explains how Australia did use an international team\u00a0in the past three decades, and\u00a0which was very similar to what was also\u00a0at stake in the\u00a01939 American Hockey League, The NHL League and the AFL\u00a0the first year that teams were actually played in the US, the AFL's first game ever. They had to play both the US and USA Football teams in Australia's AFL with\u00a0playing in the American NFL. In a year that was a very big milestone in the development of the game, it was finally that Australian Football League and AFL combined, with\u00a0playing the NFL\u00a0alongside US football.\nWhile the AFL\u00a0was just starting to\u00a0take off (\u00a0both was named after US football and\u00a0football was one of the biggest sports in\u00a0America) the\u00a0FIFA\u00a0is already enjoying new interest, and a new era of being able to compete with the rest of the world\u00a0with no financial barriers to entry.","token_len":625,"entropy":[9.1574,1.5621,5.0063,12.0404,1.7583,6.7147,6.9445,3.6531,3.4363,7.3698,3.1719,1.5043,5.2184,6.1178,1.1917,2.3269,0.3571,0.8515,14.281,2.0458,1.0305,5.2556,5.1721,8.5501,9.3399,0.3166,4.8878,1.4252,0.9814,4.2872,0.9559,3.0802,11.4456,8.1572,4.2569,5.1731,1.875,2.8041,0.3861,5.0755,0.0029,0.0466,0.1901,1.5458,8.0882,0.7604,3.4979,0.247,0.1163,4.5185,4.9122,1.6135,4.4687,0.0817,3.0077,1.1822,0.9219,4.757,1.8769,1.1479,2.0487,2.6026,5.5164,3.3972,1.8454,3.9548,2.0379,3.3681,3.4752,1.7881,5.8027,1.3968,4.6534,2.9102,1.2545,1.9827,2.8834,6.0809,1.2795,0.252,4.1438,2.5956,1.7872,5.3318,0.5511,5.7161,0.0367,3.7391,1.0478,2.1443,2.2598,4.7447,0.6572,0.82,4.4975,0.798,6.2932,1.1625,4.1647,3.5499,1.7956,2.6856,1.9171,3.9153,5.5115,1.9942,4.6615,6.1505,4.8279,2.6429,3.1609,2.5267,0.8619,2.5032,0.161,1.1057,0.8991,1.0357,2.0426,1.3815,3.8386,1.3012,1.4052,0.5376,2.92,4.2172,5.1383,0.9099,4.9929,5.3212,6.1779,2.7807,5.5351,2.3298,0.4189,0.317,5.2587,2.4104,0.515,1.0115,5.086,2.0977,1.7253,2.6745,4.8402,5.4299,2.7319,3.2716,1.6309,5.4506,2.9776,5.4673,2.7362,4.0858,0.2448,2.2259,4.4957,1.0501,1.9332,3.313,2.191,2.378,0.2876,0.3335,2.2998,0.4941,1.972,4.4829,1.3705,3.7228,0.0192,0.0819,5.5511,2.1194,0.9448,1.2359,2.1661,1.4438,5.2826,4.8574,5.8838,4.1762,5.665,1.9917,2.0299,2.9296,1.9378,4.6132,1.8834,1.6541,1.5617,1.5885,5.1719,1.2824,5.2085,0.2446,1.4444,3.1661,1.2601,4.3242,4.6419,0.0013,1.8358,2.9335,2.2231,4.014,1.8906,0.6937,0.6718,4.1404,1.052,0.0002,1.4743,2.6414,5.5179,5.305,1.4702,0.5868,3.8239,1.2262,3.4547,1.8795,2.6634,1.5515,0.7528,5.8163,0.7685,3.7808,4.2242,1.1225,5.5233,0.6383,1.622,0.7778,5.2869,0.8841,3.4342,4.1517,0.1453,1.7442,6.5373,2.9039,0.525,0.4905,4.8754,1.4405,2.8429,1.8488,5.9494,5.4189,5.9544,5.6162,1.2719,0.7611,0.2384,0.4009,0.176,0.9636,4.4375,2.9083,1.0128,1.9162,1.7492,0.8537,1.1109,2.5957,5.1655,0.5449,0.9662,2.4212,2.0292,0.2426,1.2088,0.375,2.4621,0.314,4.2905,1.502,3.7535,1.9887,0.5711,4.2406,0.342,0.308,11.8146,4.6724,0.7989,0.6582,7.3358,1.5308,1.5393,2.6434,5.5842,1.0498,0.302,3.377,0.1267,0.0008,5.1107,0.0346,0.6414,2.6158,1.5084,6.0676,2.4631,2.2747,2.1775,5.4332,3.0592,1.0095,4.5666,1.6422,5.7821,3.1009,3.7983,4.2461,3.5101,5.092,4.7488,1.6764,0.3498,2.8035,3.3831,2.706,2.0424,2.6849,2.4193,3.7757,1.3768,3.003,0.5893,2.324,4.7565,3.8501,0.0032,4.7831,0.0041,0.9427,4.9995,2.3841,2.65,1.8363,1.1019,4.0747,0.1148,3.5873,1.5493,0.7926,1.3333,4.3328,3.6191,3.5997,0.3653,5.3152,6.0039,2.9981,1.0135,0.1805,0.9254,5.5345,2.9455,2.0794,2.0346,6.1684,0.9198,0.2979,2.5505,3.0886,4.8688,2.9781,0.8943,0.8053,5.8431,0.0007,3.2258,4.1295,1.5658,1.8122,3.0344,0.6917,0.837,1.9874,5.7833,4.7927,3.8301,4.8568,1.3037,3.9695,1.2234,2.7906,3.632,1.7058,3.0841,0.8045,2.5839,1.4739,0.8744,1.7017,2.3622,5.4145,5.9265,1.3968,3.568,4.1331,0.0538,0.1018,3.5808,2.4885,3.9954,1.7741,5.4035,4.2986,0.1092,0.2371,2.3426,2.8273,5.2547,0.2092,4.0328,2.8729,5.5071,2.038,4.745,1.1015,5.1856,4.6391,0.8037,0.71,0.9053,3.6524,5.0757,4.6833,4.7406,0.3401,2.1968,4.211,4.7432,3.5593,4.3399,1.0667,0.4292,4.126,1.2428,1.3344,1.9674,4.8231,1.1873,1.0073,0.9967,2.9098,5.3181,3.6829,4.1604,1.791,0.1888,2.4066,2.5375,5.8552,3.0507,4.6289,3.0986,0.6024,0.6097,2.7651,5.5946,3.4829,5.0833,4.8097,0.0807,3.0934,5.7882,4.8861,5.3121,1.7174,0.6306,1.8524,2.7199,5.7882,3.6654,3.349,2.926,4.6002,1.1661,4.1793,3.1274,0.4737,0.8098,1.321,2.9344,3.3917,1.6971,3.3726,1.4971,3.9692,4.4462,3.0946,5.3989,3.0241,3.5533,0.9445,4.5326,1.9096,1.9076,0.4317,4.7317,5.4834,1.1743,1.737,3.6459,2.9203,2.7121,5.874,2.802,5.6082,1.5648,0.967,3.6251,5.3351,1.7415,3.0292,4.0423,4.2638,1.3438,2.0641,2.9561,3.1914,3.5566,4.8271,1.6555,1.0021,2.7724,0.0977,1.1266,2.5959,0.7979,3.2456,0.9753,5.1241,5.6894,4.6109,1.3813,0.609,3.7717,1.7028,5.1296,2.2414,2.6854,2.85,3.6054,2.6855,3.3903,1.9392,4.5314,0.526,4.5656,1.492,1.5993,1.0915,3.952,1.3498,1.2023,2.9468,2.2105,5.4206,2.5907,0.5773,4.3193,3.8532,0.5899,4.7532,3.8254,5.5108,5.821,6.0083,0.6444,4.0611,0.6724,3.9473,2.057,3.0066,2.1512,5.0744,0.2024,0.4568,4.371,1.0925,0.5897,3.1742,1.6002,2.5627,1.4502,2.2327,5.2071,0.7255,1.1268,4.732,5.3132,5.5883,5.8984,5.3769,2.5476,1.1026,3.8707,1.7754,3.512,0.7285,5.1107,2.3958,0.0199,2.9566,1.6777,1.3611,4.1883,0.0127,0.103,0.0789,3.741,3.0035,3.6018,4.8269,2.5862,1.4626,0.464,0.4278]}
{"id":3216,"ended":false,"length":574,"gen_text":"From the book's publication until the early months of 2003, its sales were unsatisfactory, according to Bill Goldstein of The New York Times. In the week following April 7, 2003,'s sales in its retail outlets slipped by six percent (from 50 to 41).\n\nThe decline in its sales did not stop there: the sales for the next two months, it said, increased by 10 percent from 2004-06, even as sales for the third half of 2004 and subsequent years were still not yet in full flow.\n\nA key factor in the sales decline was the growing popularity of the new Internet-based version of The Times with the use of its own mobile phones.\n\n\"It would be nice for us to have a mobile news service with such the ability to publish an online version,\" Mr. Goldstein said. \"But that is not the model the Times is running.\"\n\nHe said newspaper stocks are \"very volatile.\"\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A large American business could not afford to take its local partners seriously.\n\nAs it was with The Times, the new website, by comparison, will have an almost permanent site devoted to local, free-market news. It will also feature the original Times \"subscribe\" policy, which forbids publishers from selling ad-on-demand content, and includes a page that can be clicked just to enter the content.\n\nWhat is important is that the Times has a real, real audience, not a niche audience whose words are simply too much for some publishers. As a result, Mr. Goldstein said, \"we would not tolerate it for this company to be used as anything more than a platform for one group of people who would never be able to do any good without our platform.\"\n\nHe added that it was \"not like we can sell a new business by doing what the big competitors can do, and making money for one group of people who never sell any of their own. This is the way it works.\"\n\nWrite to Richard H.

{"id":2346,"ended":true,"length":576,"gen_text":"Since 1979, 85 belated Medal of Honor decorations were presented to recognize actions from the Civil War to the Vietnam War. In addition, five recipients who names were not included on the ballot were chosen for that honor: Lt. Cmdr. William G. Bouchard, Jr., Risen, N.J.; Lt. Cmdr. R. Henry M. Meehan, Jr., St. Louis; Lt. Cmdr. Robert R. W. Wark.\n\nThe Medal of Honor\n\nAwarding medals for action and courage for others is the basic foundationstone of the military. The Honor Code established in 1862 set forth four standard codes including:\n\nFor Honor: \"A salute to the American flag with a red stripe, or a salute for heroism or bravery by the military, a flag of the Republic of Germany, or both.\"\n\nFor Courage: \"A salute to the people, especially the people of the United States, who have dedicated their lives, and have sacrificed a great and final sacrifice, to defend their country against an enemy that threatens their lives and freedoms. A national flag representing any number of nations of the world. Not to be confused with a national flag representing the whole American race, although colored. No national flag should be put on public buildings because the symbols of war clearly show which colors are on the right and which are on the left.\"\n\nFor Respect: \"A salute to the Constitution and the rights of every citizen; a salute for the law of the land.\"\n\nFor Loyalty: \"A salute for a cause of duty, or to support a cause, and for the right of the American people to express their political opinions and beliefs.\"\n\nFor Honor System: \"A salute for service for the United States; at the polls; at a memorial in honor of a combatant. A salute to honor the victims, warriors, police officers or other members of the Armed Forces; for the defense of the homeland, or the protection of our republic.\"\n\nFor Loyalty Code: \"A salute to the loyalty, patriotism, devotion and trust in the loyalty of the United States to the Government of one's home country, the Republic of the United States.\"\n\nFor Honors Code: \"A salute to the service, sacrifice and sacrifices of our men and women for the protection of our republic. A salute for honor and protection of our Nation, the Republic of the United States...\"\n\nIn addition to these uniformed military honors, Medals of Honor and Medals of Distinction were also awarded to distinguished people who are currently eligible for the Medal of Honor.\n\nThe Medal of Honor was first awarded in 1917 by Franklin D. Roosevelt at the request of the US House of Representatives. The Medal commemorates the heroism of millions of American military men and women during World War I and the liberation of the People's Republic of China. The Medal was first awarded to Winston Churchill at his invitation in 1940 and today serves as one of the many honours bestowed in the National Museum by the National Museum of American History.","token_len":627,"entropy":[10.3021,0.2698,8.7631,13.8351,2.0191,16.4547,0.5004,0.0936,8.5381,0.5137,3.9045,0.4688,9.6393,7.368,5.492,1.3212,5.5179,0.6941,2.6718,2.4105,4.9714,0.1067,0.5327,2.5545,2.7319,0.4912,4.6766,5.6042,5.2973,13.8586,2.2881,4.9416,2.3852,2.6181,0.3239,6.1021,1.3865,3.7593,2.6448,5.48,2.4715,2.4453,4.6958,0.0298,3.8884,0.3243,0.0001,0.0086,2.7525,3.8876,0.3324,4.4528,5.0461,0.079,0.4938,2.6181,0.2034,4.8199,6.0854,2.2546,2.5201,0.171,2.4445,1.081,1.6023,0.0052,1.1417,0.0266,0.0039,0.001,5.31,0.281,5.0016,3.6326,0.1691,4.7904,4.0654,0.2959,0.0736,1.6564,0.0744,3.848,0.2542,0.4865,0.3829,1.0602,0.0009,0.3726,0.0059,0.0028,0.0015,3.1099,3.1373,0.0455,4.2942,0.9878,3.1713,5.2266,5.0947,3.4661,0.0007,1.99,3.2766,0.1837,0.0038,5.2075,0.0002,3.825,3.5862,3.3528,2.5529,1.7779,3.8743,2.6619,2.5989,3.3738,5.1134,1.7665,2.7245,3.9231,4.2401,8.5891,0.1413,1.3758,3.0041,1.2641,1.9048,5.64,0.6587,5.1372,1.2997,3.8997,5.9024,0.7154,4.0431,5.1639,4.8296,7.2364,2.31,0.9619,0.0003,5.3865,3.9056,2.0477,3.3873,2.3655,4.9454,1.8134,0.8783,3.5917,0.7543,4.3906,1.6809,4.6142,3.5877,1.9544,2.7197,1.4529,2.3954,3.676,4.1219,2.2699,2.4766,3.8466,1.8299,3.8978,1.7099,4.6141,3.0323,0.6239,0.6466,4.5073,0.3641,3.2675,0.6584,0.3547,5.375,0.8169,0.4219,0.0002,0.809,2.5472,0.0589,0.1793,0.3162,0.9181,0.3249,0.3332,5.715,2.2839,4.064,1.0372,2.5724,0.3044,0.7209,0.8626,0.0047,0.762,1.6105,1.5083,5.147,0.7176,0.05,3.288,2.3709,3.0582,2.2338,3.7949,0.4312,3.5451,5.6719,0.3495,1.1425,0.7454,3.0886,2.4963,0.9297,2.4379,2.7181,0.4516,1.4618,2.6786,1.6624,1.9432,1.0308,3.1465,1.9363,1.7445,4.787,1.3214,4.3828,5.7997,4.446,0.0247,1.372,3.3199,0.4063,0.542,1.7607,6.1812,2.1793,0.1083,0.7788,0.0103,1.477,0.4447,0.4407,2.4537,1.0919,4.6048,5.5718,4.7077,1.4483,5.1391,5.6057,2.6325,4.6846,1.8496,0.2551,3.635,0.2978,5.6098,0.7233,2.7796,1.9017,5.2054,2.4676,5.2138,1.0191,3.8642,6.3752,2.4848,5.0596,3.8667,0.8626,4.2177,1.4804,3.968,1.7139,0.2492,0.2541,0.2567,0.0025,0.2378,0.9393,0.1374,0.0002,0.6328,4.8622,0.1082,0.1405,0.4838,0.6854,0.3194,0.6041,5.7463,1.5541,0.8339,2.5537,0.354,2.8449,1.2701,4.7939,1.3468,0.9333,2.4201,1.3543,4.8596,1.9406,0.3324,0.0284,2.9311,0.0854,0.0002,0.544,3.6877,0.0103,0.0461,0.0614,0.1769,0.2236,1.7231,3.0637,2.7497,2.3815,3.7074,1.2953,1.828,2.4063,4.1523,1.6435,0.715,1.8727,2.8198,2.9209,1.5149,3.5287,0.3273,1.2959,3.2615,0.0372,0.2264,3.9902,0.419,3.1589,1.2008,1.9584,2.5833,1.5698,0.0866,0.0002,0.7322,2.1137,5.6209,0.3232,0.1364,0.3398,0.7592,1.3955,3.4799,4.8984,1.1618,1.8113,0.0065,3.599,7.1158,1.3529,5.5483,2.9862,1.8084,3.1,3.4343,4.5502,1.297,0.0452,2.0138,5.8573,0.899,2.2906,1.2883,0.8764,1.3069,1.9683,1.2938,4.6973,3.3636,5.7181,0.4193,6.5433,0.2027,3.2293,1.6442,2.2263,0.0226,0.1706,2.3938,0.0619,3.8857,3.6658,1.257,4.3717,0.1417,1.0117,2.7382,1.7147,1.2979,1.9787,1.7265,0.0702,3.2276,4.9805,1.2875,0.0948,0.0002,1.3848,2.9651,0.0091,2.2978,0.1151,0.155,0.2772,0.5639,0.7433,1.059,4.4288,2.2984,1.5779,0.4244,3.6779,1.335,5.7553,3.6928,0.5364,5.0412,0.7512,0.8032,0.9206,0.0029,1.1089,0.7087,5.2809,0.0886,6.3712,1.387,2.5495,0.3884,1.1925,3.0357,2.4917,0.1101,1.4832,0.1886,0.0638,2.2231,0.1034,0.0002,1.2115,3.6927,1.3775,0.5457,0.0424,0.0905,0.17,0.2241,0.4014,0.5964,4.5009,2.2321,2.9459,0.7441,4.4342,0.2296,2.4868,3.2208,0.1637,0.0298,3.6972,0.8292,2.5752,0.3565,0.947,2.1173,1.7962,0.53,0.444,1.9238,3.4074,1.3059,4.7955,0.8151,1.3361,4.8018,2.0616,2.274,0.9797,0.055,0.5844,0.0691,0.0038,8.1245,0.1725,0.0002,3.6202,1.4821,0.7798,2.3534,5.2008,2.2979,2.6663,1.8451,0.316,4.9205,0.217,0.0052,2.6151,2.1413,0.0169,5.2754,0.0129,1.3444,1.5575,0.9109,0.6089,3.8942,5.3177,1.3933,4.1688,4.5905,6.0404,0.6033,1.6666,0.8829,0.0118,0.0369,0.79,1.3647,0.0003,1.6943,2.0902,0.0395,0.1339,2.9508,2.3821,0.9248,0.9218,3.0216,1.6577,6.4046,0.4907,0.0036,0.0002,4.1692,0.5218,3.3123,0.0025,1.2982,5.2168,3.8994,0.0496,0.0155,0.5697,1.4332,2.5405,7.6203,0.3823,0.7494,3.0311,1.1062,5.3677,0.104,1.7517,3.4685,1.1341,0.3651,0.0181,2.2134,0.5581,0.0018,0.4401,1.0809,1.3981,5.3951,0.1643,1.751,5.4262,0.2158,0.0135,0.0808,0.1905,1.147,1.5171,1.7478,1.6601,2.1249,1.1819,1.3287,5.0051,0.0354,2.4541,2.7013,3.6138,1.238,3.267,2.4897,5.9392,4.7136,0.2136,3.2211,0.009,0.2092,5.2691,5.87,0.6698,1.6821,4.3156,1.0963,3.3493,4.2391,4.2954,0.422,1.5807,1.8453,0.1017,0.8023,0.0288,0.5761]}
{"id":599,"ended":true,"length":578,"gen_text":"The final objective was Maryang San, a steep hill rising 200 metres ( 660 ft ) above the valley about 2 @, @ 500 metres ( 2 @, @ 700 yd ) above the plateau. The terrain is rugged, not to mention steep. The steep hill had no water source and all paths were blocked. I knew we had to keep the canyon in our minds.\nAfter the trail crossed the canyon, we met up with Peter P. of Gulls Valley and Peter A. to see if we could have been interested in meeting at another trailhead that day. A few days later, we visited the former summit of the Chirang ( Chirang ) Dam that had been removed from the landscape recently for restoration. We decided to explore with Peter P. on what we found there: sand dunes on the surface of the canyon.\nA good rock wall with a long, steep slope was used to guide us. There were also rocks from a canyon and some pines. In addition, there were rocks in a natural area north of the water stream, so some of the rocks were easy to see. It was worth checking out any of the small and sharp rocks that lay around on a cliff, like this one.\nThe cliffs from that canyon are very steep, but they are mostly rock formations. We also came across a cedar (tundra crevice) on the other side, which seemed to have been raised up in the wind for some reason. There was a short but beautiful cliff over a cliff face. It was at the end of this section of the wall that we met up with our two friends, Dr. H. and Mr. N..\nAfter we crossed, we went over the rock wall and started on our final trek. It was a long distance from M.P. to C. P. we were on our final descent of this canyon with the help of an electric cord. On our next attempt, we were back in the valley after a week of hiking during which time we reached the base of one of the most famous rivers in China, Kansai.\nSo, we decided to hike here, because of the beautiful views at night.\u00a0\nOn our way back, we stopped and asked a friend how we were going to do this hike.\u00a0\nHe gave us our guidebook. As is customary with all guides who have traveled for some distance, his wife wanted to know about where to go next.\u00a0 I thought we would go over this first trip with her.\u00a0\nWe eventually stopped at K. P. to wait for our guidebook to arrive. He was so kind.\u00a0\nThen they brought us back after two weeks of hiking along the riverbank at W. P.\nI really got my head around all of these mountain places. There is also a lot of rock under the riverbank at this point. It is definitely not for everyone, but we do not have to take much risk with our backcountry hikes here. It is really cool to finally start in the mountains by doing one trail like this once again.","token_len":629,"entropy":[7.1861,7.359,2.1834,12.2151,11.7782,7.2838,1.931,1.5894,10.0487,1.9219,6.5962,6.159,1.965,3.0489,12.7124,1.1104,1.9776,0.914,0.7573,4.6065,7.3493,3.5118,14.1767,6.7461,8.8951,6.287,1.4109,0.7343,2.992,2.8795,2.7794,2.3628,4.3246,7.1813,2.5937,0.9759,0.8825,0.5338,5.1875,0.6129,1.733,4.4045,2.3062,4.081,1.1966,5.1462,3.7261,0.0585,3.6969,1.0482,1.571,4.6051,1.7315,4.011,3.5364,3.6283,4.3426,1.6585,5.3126,6.1107,1.0129,1.6412,1.4544,3.6658,5.2688,4.163,1.7059,0.3067,4.7748,2.5157,5.7768,4.75,2.9395,2.7419,1.2581,1.6163,5.5761,2.318,5.1361,3.6178,0.5181,3.916,0.8718,1.3982,5.3096,1.9531,0.0982,6.655,4.7189,2.5065,4.9649,5.901,5.1548,3.4662,4.5429,3.2606,4.4097,3.3551,0.0363,5.126,3.168,1.0412,0.5777,0.2402,4.6279,6.4267,6.0751,0.2576,4.632,3.4451,3.6952,3.482,0.3748,4.5724,2.3636,0.1942,4.7245,1.8437,1.5508,0.2865,0.6865,1.1056,4.4794,1.6244,6.1113,5.0584,0.4329,1.0242,5.8765,5.0963,1.3148,5.3028,5.4355,0.6032,0.0201,3.3376,4.9201,4.048,1.9867,0.5225,4.9544,1.3209,0.4576,5.789,6.0268,4.5839,3.885,0.4271,2.1622,3.5729,0.3037,4.2773,5.229,1.1449,2.4738,0.6985,3.6715,4.5383,1.8207,4.2744,2.1595,5.1649,6.1678,1.9704,0.0694,3.7877,0.7447,4.167,1.417,0.2765,2.9341,1.5675,1.8821,3.864,5.0796,4.694,3.9683,3.3958,1.4611,4.7752,2.5617,3.5656,1.9854,2.3613,4.0676,1.1318,3.9021,0.9811,2.0657,3.5177,0.7532,2.9224,3.5104,4.1517,2.4972,5.2101,4.5271,2.1748,5.5087,1.0147,1.4747,4.1981,2.0476,0.5846,1.5009,0.5443,2.8609,3.0479,2.4328,4.888,1.6807,6.3809,0.1452,0.265,4.6619,5.7956,2.6046,2.9658,5.1947,1.3371,0.4716,1.6582,1.0761,5.0763,0.0961,1.769,0.6145,3.6657,0.4163,4.991,3.7394,0.6501,5.8254,1.7394,0.2927,4.4427,4.8332,5.5677,0.826,1.5532,5.0958,3.1841,4.4549,4.1704,3.5177,3.5009,4.1999,3.0872,0.8789,1.2297,0.8316,2.2138,5.1519,5.4,4.3773,1.6996,2.4308,2.9903,1.2976,1.2639,1.7966,2.2997,1.5206,4.8427,4.0434,3.4001,0.8481,2.4499,3.6247,3.8726,0.2733,1.1037,5.7813,2.042,4.6404,5.1636,4.2816,0.0129,5.524,0.669,0.4069,2.3938,0.6492,2.4166,0.0298,2.8175,1.7126,3.9431,0.7019,2.0125,0.8193,5.4601,2.8968,2.7435,1.0156,4.1084,3.0802,1.884,1.1204,0.3201,3.6269,1.1278,1.4894,5.3548,4.0444,3.1259,4.4035,3.584,2.4402,3.4531,2.4608,1.8724,2.4103,0.7228,4.8942,1.7239,1.4683,0.0206,3.2903,2.9959,1.3061,0.3364,5.6967,0.6247,0.4385,2.4775,1.6853,0.0647,4.41,4.7053,1.6487,1.5349,5.2784,0.1915,4.8651,0.4546,1.1132,3.3567,0.0197,4.6368,7.275,1.6656,3.0173,2.3692,4.6167,4.0459,0.367,2.8749,2.6252,1.2887,4.1601,0.544,1.4127,3.8013,4.8633,1.4026,4.2535,3.6373,0.9867,2.8447,0.5163,1.5025,2.6768,5.8662,2.0999,6.8477,3.7235,3.3856,0.2251,1.7675,4.8857,0.6605,4.7614,0.527,5.3382,2.2629,3.429,1.6242,3.3209,3.4368,3.2395,3.8201,2.2269,4.6009,2.1062,3.2961,0.0082,4.2623,4.2976,4.9271,0.8485,4.7164,1.0413,3.6373,3.2804,0.3505,0.2093,2.67,3.4206,1.6086,0.917,3.2267,3.9191,1.5742,4.2453,1.1619,1.4962,6.7276,1.2157,2.0272,0.2565,3.6848,1.1087,4.81,0.103,4.2256,0.0643,0.1586,2.3295,2.9227,5.1803,0.3304,2.2276,1.8198,4.693,2.5256,0.6427,0.7634,1.003,5.6735,1.2978,2.1464,2.7454,0.1539,2.7793,4.972,2.5788,3.1124,2.681,0.6238,3.2208,2.5674,4.8659,3.6004,0.902,5.6638,0.8388,3.947,0.8305,2.319,0.863,1.2783,0.2986,2.403,3.1021,3.2464,3.0737,1.8016,3.9927,1.5756,1.2433,1.0628,0.7667,3.0485,1.7906,1.2924,0.3621,3.8739,0.1722,1.9256,3.8659,0.1546,3.7727,3.9424,2.7723,2.1436,4.7373,6.64,1.8119,2.1208,3.3377,1.3166,4.4522,2.4047,4.3327,4.1441,3.0144,3.977,0.5319,4.2594,5.9333,5.2294,0.2698,1.7576,2.7941,5.567,2.9318,1.4869,2.5667,0.3421,1.6782,5.0832,3.9142,2.106,1.1616,2.3495,3.8334,2.5093,4.1006,4.6995,2.7451,1.4512,1.701,1.2203,0.4886,1.5126,5.6095,3.6478,0.9821,3.2174,3.3591,1.9877,0.1608,2.6744,4.4929,0.3866,1.8076,1.1003,1.5336,1.6046,0.4555,0.4401,3.1418,2.0403,3.9632,2.1233,3.3362,1.0741,0.2794,4.6986,6.1649,3.7221,0.8788,2.0547,5.9252,3.7132,1.4397,1.103,0.9711,4.9277,0.5073,2.4083,3.7681,4.2076,5.4057,0.8894,1.4088,0.1261,2.5035,3.156,3.4222,5.4562,4.3752,2.2544,0.3673,4.853,1.1264,2.3882,4.9447,5.3098,0.8711,3.3768,2.2108,4.0716,0.4938,3.3819,0.2208,4.5117,5.7717,0.5501,2.8573,1.794,4.3306,2.7503,1.1698,0.7103,2.5983,1.2492,4.3843,2.2036,3.3799,1.1149,1.2892,0.3455,3.1129,4.4412,2.4692,1.2649,0.8962,3.7613,3.6134,2.3996,3.1489,1.5174,5.084,0.588,3.4518,3.3005,0.2901,3.4125,0.6132,3.9685,3.5098,0.7088,4.0252,4.3752,4.4709,1.3702,1.71,6.1131,4.2893,3.9256,5.1814,5.4917,0.233,5.6954,1.7035,0.3547]}
{"id":1367,"ended":true,"length":579,"gen_text":"Starting in 2015, Valve began sponsoring smaller, but seasonally held tournaments with a fixed $ 3 million prize pool, known as the Dota Major Championships.

The format for the tournaments are very similar to the Season 1, except the first 1,000 players to qualify for the Dota 2 tournament qualify for the top prize pool. As we noted earlier with the Overwatch League, the prize pool for the 2016 Major qualifiers would be between $ 2 million and $ 6 million with a 4.5 million prize pool for the regular qualifier.\n\n, the prize pool for the 2016 Major qualifiers would be between $ 2 million and $ 6 million with a 4.5 million prize pool for the regular qualifier. We will be adding more, and more, new teams and events to the Dota Major, so expect more. Stay tuned.\n\n. Season 2, while in Early Access, was a pretty awesome experience for many who participated. At first, you could see a few things:\n\n\u00b7 Most of the competitive matches were very good\n\n\u00b7 Many of the team compositions were very different\n\n\u00b7 Many of the other matches had huge implications.\n\n. You could go to a lot of forums, and find yourself reading the same blogs over and over.\n\n. The tournament system would also allow players who played in the tournament to get access to a prize pool and earn more money when the games started, if necessary.\n\nOther details?\n\nThat's what Valve is looking for in this update.\n\nAs expected, a lot of the content we are bringing in is not as new as we expected (as we mentioned above), but some of the new features that were available in the previous versions included a \"Lifecycle\" feature where players could choose which changes to make, and which features to keep, for a period of time.\n\n. You could also add your own \"Player Customization\" functionality for your opponents.\n\n. In addition to giving you more options to choose from, you can play as friends.\n\n. The addition of team-based matches could give your teams even higher stakes if they manage a decent amount of map control and are playing together.\n\nIn addition to all of these, the changes are going to improve, so be sure to check out some of our other coverage to learn more.\n\nUpdate : October 1st\n\nThere was good news and a delay from Valve to release our release notes earlier today (the end of this week!) for Season 1, but we are not done with the big news yet. We will be reporting on the event later this month, so stay tuned.\n\nUpdate 2: We'll be writing back about today's update in a way that will make you aware the release of this update is very much in progress.","token_len":629,"entropy":[3.6078,3.757,0.1753,7.6132,3.9318,7.0767,7.5656,2.1825,3.6056,11.4786,2.5465,8.14,1.7532,3.3716,1.8809,6.8601,4.3442,9.9469,2.4292,0.3965,0.012,2.0661,6.073,0.0805,0.831,4.2287,6.9275,6.5004,0.3713,1.8887,4.4707,3.8009,0.9381,2.4055,6.3672,4.3338,0.1691,0.1779,0.8405,5.5935,1.8319,3.3862,3.9683,3.8082,5.3625,2.213,4.0939,5.79,0.5884,0.2744,0.8706,2.3338,1.623,0.8114,0.515,4.1428,1.1474,3.6891,4.422,0.4588,0.591,5.2104,3.5024,0.0991,0.7177,1.2448,0.0009,10.6935,2.6427,0.7742,0.0053,0.0582,0.0003,0.0256,0.0016,0.0001,0.002,0.0054,0.0021,0.0047,0.0012,0.0026,8.0191,9.0548,0.0029,0.0068,0.2074,0.0122,0.0321,0.0684,0.0039,0.0009,0.0032,0.0014,0.0111,0.0102,0.0125,0.0016,0.0006,0.0011,0.0412,0.0041,6.9454,0.1155,0.0019,0.0104,0.0618,0.0006,0.0013,0.0082,0.0023,0.0057,0.0017,0.0026,0.0641,0.0221,0.0084,0.0064,0.0015,0.0023,0.0023,0.0012,0.0008,0.0007,5.3274,5.7349,3.2066,1.991,5.6602,0.829,5.5716,1.5522,0.6351,1.5885,3.8214,0.214,1.2207,0.9257,4.665,2.3392,5.3349,4.8362,0.5845,5.8389,0.1458,2.3954,0.698,0.1423,0.029,3.049,0.0455,5.0326,1.7273,5.102,2.606,0.6917,0.8971,0.5069,0.0936,1.7572,0.5568,5.1734,2.6376,0.6974,0.9481,0.0002,5.8351,3.9056,0.0065,0.0005,0.0012,0.0012,0.0009,0.0007,0.0014,0.0047,0.0006,0.0008,0.0046,0.3534,0.0018,0.0686,0.0013,0.0191,0.0045,0.0005,0.0042,0.0712,0.0007,0.0029,0.0101,0.0023,0.0063,0.0018,0.0014,0.0008,0.0334,0.0005,4.1734,3.622,1.4912,3.4177,1.753,5.393,1.8577,1.4627,1.3794,3.4617,2.6607,2.8522,2.2084,1.8473,0.5009,1.3075,2.454,2.6336,2.0702,3.0304,1.7449,2.9883,4.3371,0.0048,1.2278,0.3388,0.0002,5.9436,8.2759,1.4497,3.2253,5.2548,4.5784,5.8562,0.113,0.2154,1.8508,2.0678,4.2631,4.9833,0.9702,1.317,2.0785,4.3591,2.304,0.8674,5.3609,2.1967,0.7044,3.5826,1.9798,2.7268,1.8879,3.2128,3.1163,2.6329,1.0649,0.0002,5.1016,5.409,0.8317,0.1477,4.9701,3.954,0.7668,2.8222,2.9264,2.5345,0.0002,0.0114,4.2037,0.8908,0.1198,3.6502,1.8374,0.5778,1.3303,4.1596,1.2087,0.0003,0.0564,2.8922,0.3742,0.0365,4.8941,4.3261,3.1075,5.779,5.2524,3.776,1.0677,0.0002,3.3963,4.5147,1.1513,5.3999,1.8749,2.0173,4.0767,0.0196,5.9633,1.8227,1.9781,2.5628,5.4441,4.3356,3.0673,2.7728,5.2256,1.9644,0.0148,0.0003,1.489,0.9172,0.0002,1.0559,2.0778,4.1604,4.284,3.9618,3.6789,1.9677,2.4672,4.3086,3.3846,1.7915,0.9129,3.879,0.2884,3.2928,3.8352,0.0212,2.1546,4.759,0.1082,3.6604,5.6416,3.0424,1.2754,4.8583,2.2395,5.0474,3.159,2.6659,4.3891,4.3276,0.1515,0.2618,0.0002,5.9069,5.08,5.659,0.7079,0.0002,5.7189,0.6245,3.7717,2.7172,1.4472,3.8613,0.72,2.0932,3.2469,3.703,0.572,1.8833,0.0002,3.9554,5.7709,0.1521,3.9742,0.8309,0.0844,1.4389,3.0537,2.9623,3.2717,2.9035,2.4815,1.9497,3.537,3.2264,2.9862,0.28,1.2319,2.6605,3.9618,3.8611,1.709,2.6351,1.6427,1.1493,0.5488,4.0821,0.6483,0.5271,2.9465,0.6417,2.8715,2.2916,4.9232,1.1732,0.7463,1.6963,3.2968,5.1568,2.5157,4.2674,5.9657,3.1737,2.0475,1.0317,1.4297,2.3151,0.9245,0.9372,2.8999,2.4223,4.4544,1.6881,0.5902,2.7992,1.1665,2.7116,4.4877,0.5412,2.3583,2.0401,2.3497,1.6805,2.4097,0.1004,0.1296,0.7125,0.8614,0.0002,3.5628,4.0387,1.7005,1.9208,4.0144,3.9423,0.3041,3.5129,5.8684,4.8456,0.3883,0.3518,4.4407,3.2057,2.1563,5.362,1.0897,0.7533,0.0002,0.4807,3.9826,0.7982,0.7172,5.9887,0.8053,2.1186,1.4344,1.2932,2.4621,0.6423,0.4469,1.2789,1.3804,6.0731,2.7587,6.027,2.9346,0.3183,0.0002,0.3668,2.8183,5.7109,0.0342,5.4246,2.5178,0.6706,3.3097,3.2597,3.1925,3.7317,2.459,3.8303,5.625,2.6779,3.9933,1.6656,4.8432,5.7044,4.251,1.474,0.0302,4.692,0.5533,2.5181,2.922,4.1614,3.0298,0.5186,0.1214,0.0003,5.2588,0.9791,0.633,2.025,0.5597,0.9171,1.5717,2.4003,3.6278,2.134,3.0608,0.0541,3.7744,5.6276,2.4119,2.9861,0.2055,0.0328,0.5524,0.8103,3.6197,0.1391,2.3384,1.8368,3.6262,3.6086,2.2783,0.2479,1.2323,0.4666,0.0002,3.3922,5.4157,5.3252,3.0705,0.6524,3.493,0.0003,4.4641,2.3508,7.3353,0.149,3.1977,2.3424,5.9279,3.9459,1.8638,1.6349,2.2007,3.4506,4.8291,2.0225,6.2305,1.2248,2.7661,3.7962,4.6245,0.1387,3.4939,1.6082,4.369,3.544,5.1665,2.1922,1.8434,1.131,1.5007,2.4928,4.133,3.3658,1.0968,1.4407,3.7685,2.6131,0.6293,0.303,1.4943,1.8926,0.8136,5.3693,1.525,1.4907,5.4545,3.3253,1.3473,2.3343,1.3339,0.9998,0.9201,0.0028,0.7978,0.3615,0.0002,1.6993,0.5681,0.9693,3.2324,3.3629,0.4487,4.8022,4.9087,2.7571,6.7761,0.0604,2.1227,2.5135,1.2377,5.6052,0.2483,1.4779,2.4244,2.3587,2.8198,6.7114,4.1717,1.7449,2.3006,0.6755,1.3025,5.0477,1.6094,1.3348,0.6453,0.4093]}
{"id":3939,"ended":true,"length":596,"gen_text":"In 1957, the donation of 1 @, @ 500 acres ( 6 @. @ 1 km2 ) in Pontiac Township, Oakland County, Michigan prompted creation of Michigan State University \u2013 Oakley. The Oakley Centre is located just off of the western edge of Michigan's Great Lakes. In 2003, the Oakley Centre was extended to include three new buildings in the east of Michigan \u2013 Detroit, Detroit Technical Institute, and Oakley County. The extension of the center is now known as the \"Rise of Oakley and Michigan State University\", where he leads efforts to improve the health and environmental quality of Oakley County. As we enter our fifth year of living in Michigan, we look forward to the future.\n\nIn 2003, we founded the second of four schools the University of Michigan \u2013 Oakley \u2013 now serves. Currently, the campus is located at 45 East Michigan Avenue in Detroit, Michigan, with the addition of several acres of land that will support some 600 undergraduate and graduate students who will be able to complete their research in a classroom environment.\n\nWe have seen so many of the positive things that Michigan State University provides, both through its excellent alumni network and on a larger scale from its research and administration, like the \"Graduate Life\".\n\nIn 2005, Oakley College President Henry W. Woodland announced that the school would be expanding its campus from 45 East Michigan Avenue in Detroit, Michigan, to 120 acres in Oakley. The university has invested over $600,000 into several projects of its own over the past two years, including construction of a campus in Oakley which opened in 2007, the installation of a \"New Oakley Building\" in 2004, the creation of an expanded office, and a \"New Oakley Campus\" on the second floor in April 2005. The University of Michigan and Oakley University has been in the partnership since 1987, and since then we have worked very actively to bring together our student populations.\n\nWe love those young American men and women over 35 who don't work in factories where they earn less per hour than those who work in factories, but who know we could bring them jobs. If you want help with any of the above, visit us on the page on our site and check the link below to get started.\n\nThis has been our commitment to helping our students, our community, and our country continue to grow and thrive year by year. We hope that you will join us now in celebrating 10 years of Michigan State University as our national educational institution of choice. As we prepare for the new, higher education year, some of you might not be able to attend.\n\nIf you are interested in going to Oakley College, please consider completing an application, which we hope you will receive within the time window to date. If all of these requirements are met, you may have the opportunity to study in Oakley at Oakley College in November of 2015, and after that fall to study abroad at the University of Michigan in Fall 2015 - and if you are interested in going to the University for a fellowship, please visit us on our website.","token_len":630,"entropy":[11.0486,0.2504,1.7889,11.8115,1.4293,4.8497,14.5449,6.4155,4.8662,8.4324,5.8294,3.9691,8.6682,6.5425,5.3071,6.0384,2.6787,7.3133,3.5977,0.7456,3.9184,8.3123,0.3266,4.8012,1.5219,11.1432,1.2386,0.5168,1.2772,8.5255,9.7839,0.0403,4.7373,2.6987,1.2181,6.5558,4.6377,3.0759,2.8721,1.8278,2.1567,0.0086,5.7566,2.053,2.0348,3.5962,2.3854,1.5031,1.8394,5.4925,1.1604,0.0034,2.8332,1.9586,3.5838,0.0302,1.271,3.611,5.1502,0.2052,1.011,1.8055,0.0016,0.6203,0.8105,4.6687,0.4024,1.5013,4.8879,2.1016,2.0798,3.1678,1.6457,5.4448,1.6919,1.9176,2.964,5.6768,1.7938,2.3115,5.2474,1.8901,1.1214,0.1283,2.8156,0.0312,5.215,1.4177,1.5364,5.1994,1.9444,0.447,4.4135,2.6053,3.3542,4.2586,0.0395,0.8292,3.0114,5.015,3.7904,0.3812,0.8171,0.0246,5.5246,2.0776,0.6896,0.2697,3.542,5.1231,6.3318,5.5127,5.9826,0.1831,2.8896,0.9444,2.989,1.0317,2.9959,1.069,0.082,4.0406,0.0037,0.8576,0.6068,4.9153,4.8044,3.7762,2.6066,2.7605,0.3703,0.9476,4.6078,0.4903,0.9874,0.2993,1.1566,3.2634,0.352,0.0095,2.5066,2.2435,1.2981,1.2004,0.0036,4.0552,4.4461,0.1474,3.3546,4.4968,1.0656,6.6829,3.1207,2.1243,4.6079,6.3428,2.6363,0.107,0.1889,3.2407,0.4339,0.0012,2.7054,4.9521,2.895,0.971,6.13,0.4248,1.2028,3.6583,0.843,1.6781,1.7345,5.4513,5.1578,1.9961,1.1713,1.2967,1.5446,1.0052,0.837,1.9896,2.6453,2.3722,3.6093,0.0162,4.4871,4.6162,0.5124,2.1522,3.3237,1.5125,4.348,5.4652,4.1036,4.4492,0.7868,0.1112,0.1693,3.6947,1.3843,1.6294,2.4108,0.005,3.3932,0.8899,5.3929,1.6917,2.7865,4.587,1.6707,0.7922,1.7008,0.0002,2.5716,2.2908,4.651,5.347,0.7461,4.2058,1.4027,5.5062,2.3962,0.8703,2.4656,0.7035,0.5758,3.8348,2.4611,4.698,2.987,1.2887,4.8556,3.6273,3.4848,0.3627,3.963,2.5664,4.0365,0.2572,5.1396,1.5834,5.363,1.3178,4.0193,2.5377,5.5489,1.306,4.81,6.0912,0.3511,4.345,5.6666,2.3111,0.0002,2.3855,3.1165,0.1524,2.7289,0.001,2.6257,4.1817,5.7626,4.2082,0.3854,5.0529,5.7303,2.809,0.8925,1.4182,2.548,0.5334,1.3285,2.6483,1.0364,2.3947,3.0919,3.0878,1.471,0.0393,0.2102,1.2851,0.3686,0.7055,0.2546,0.5056,0.1319,4.9336,0.7046,1.4764,1.2705,0.0022,2.8741,1.7621,3.1032,1.8931,4.9358,1.8637,0.0767,4.7182,0.339,0.0018,2.8795,5.9179,2.0405,4.89,1.9429,0.244,4.1561,0.0576,0.9544,2.6152,0.3797,1.2544,0.6957,3.7326,0.1125,1.0677,4.0822,2.1361,2.1702,0.0024,4.7986,4.6956,0.3478,2.534,1.7014,2.5929,2.9747,0.012,1.0717,4.3709,5.4634,1.4028,0.0169,4.0489,0.5175,1.5443,4.7335,0.2513,1.7701,2.1623,0.0056,2.3725,5.0983,4.1992,3.5977,1.2827,2.3207,3.5071,2.2888,0.1155,0.0011,2.9012,0.6133,4.1508,1.0062,3.5706,0.1007,2.3087,4.3107,2.5111,0.152,2.2861,3.3561,1.2631,0.0363,3.6369,0.6292,0.001,3.8639,4.0695,2.034,3.2775,2.0906,6.0487,1.4774,3.9173,1.188,0.9367,3.9615,1.8224,2.9862,0.1543,1.9944,3.6979,6.1682,1.0245,3.4077,1.2046,2.8243,3.8952,3.8294,2.3852,0.8036,0.0002,2.3633,5.8314,6.5222,3.9454,6.2001,2.021,0.1975,0.012,7.526,5.824,0.5592,5.6786,0.0017,4.5699,1.7358,4.4983,6.1459,0.9735,4.1289,2.4822,5.9595,0.4317,0.3957,3.2489,0.7187,1.3669,0.5971,1.7449,3.256,2.017,1.1049,4.4142,5.1971,4.6201,3.8593,1.2322,2.1567,1.9024,4.7414,1.8103,2.3073,5.7327,2.0208,3.7731,0.4483,1.3379,1.9903,0.6437,3.8417,3.1135,1.8893,2.0594,4.6886,3.0033,1.165,3.4853,2.7269,5.06,4.0434,3.361,1.251,1.3678,2.3643,1.2913,0.5689,0.6651,0.0002,4.8054,4.6713,0.5472,2.189,4.8197,0.7763,3.6457,1.9669,0.7003,2.8601,1.9585,2.4606,0.3683,0.225,0.6848,1.8855,4.6581,0.2845,0.4364,1.8287,1.8303,6.9114,3.3075,0.0022,0.3045,1.7033,3.0099,1.3966,1.0636,0.7141,0.4802,0.1357,6.3944,1.7362,4.0492,7.1116,0.1967,0.1592,3.9673,0.2138,0.0701,2.9944,3.329,3.1308,5.8887,1.2068,3.9149,0.9125,0.4725,5.1929,1.2489,4.5292,1.0835,1.1924,2.7194,5.1146,4.7379,0.4399,3.149,0.5681,6.5909,0.3856,1.231,2.4299,3.5701,1.4782,1.3463,0.0131,1.2395,2.5442,1.7112,0.0002,3.9219,0.0884,1.4418,1.7291,0.0794,4.9937,0.3661,1.2594,0.0006,0.9251,1.0549,1.223,3.3578,5.9922,2.1135,1.9955,3.4182,2.6743,2.2407,2.8457,1.8369,0.3261,2.8096,1.4408,0.5873,3.4167,3.5808,4.1379,5.317,0.1489,2.5648,6.4361,1.7267,3.0031,2.8999,0.3282,0.1587,0.2076,1.0486,1.3766,3.5107,1.7411,0.6307,0.0271,4.9162,1.4731,1.1884,0.0009,3.6147,1.7144,0.0006,0.5594,2.6013,4.4215,1.9654,2.9056,2.2898,1.9875,4.8827,0.3727,4.5381,4.5507,2.0644,4.5884,2.0057,1.6088,0.4313,0.0332,0.8359,1.2563,3.2104,1.2626,8.12,3.9588,3.3326,0.4125,1.3413,1.1951,0.0597,2.7657,0.3165,2.7249,0.7222,5.0852,1.7398,5.3431,0.8731,1.7981,3.003,1.8965,0.9795,1.2898,0.7582,1.0276]}
{"id":4011,"ended":true,"length":593,"gen_text":"Plasma is often called the fourth state of matter after solid, liquids and gases, despite plasma typically being an ionized gas. It is distinct from these and other lower @ - @ energies because its orbit coincides with the orbit of C 3 on the bright side of the sun because of its lower flux. Its mass is around 9.6 kg, and its energies are around 9.9 J= 0.5 J-1J+.\n\nA few times before this event and before the end of our solar system, a meteorite hit our sky, giving rise to the solar flares, flares that have already created some 1.5 Million solar flares so far, causing more than 200 000 000 solar flares a year on Earth for years, since 2007.\n\nThe solar system, of course, is one of the last visible planets with a large body orbiting it. Although the moon and planets have no visible bodies around them (as far as we know), the largest, Mercury and Venus, were born with very large bodies of water in the early universe.\n\nWhile many have made some of the closest observations of the solar system to Earth, not a single one has managed to get there. As of now, the longest search has been done for a new comet that broke up at 6.4 AU, where it might give clues about the composition of the gas and dust on the surface of the solar system.\n\nThe next major discovery we will make in the next few days will be the return of life from the sun at a faster rate. When we see that the sun is about to grow out of its solar tail, it will come out at least 5 minutes sooner, when the sun will approach its final position, then only a fraction of a second sooner.\n\nWe live in this moment of superstorms at the beginning of the year, where the sun will be about to pass through a giant cloudless area where we might even see a small amount of sunlight. A large, dense cloud will burst through the thickest layers of dust where the sun will be about to enter the cloud, and begin to rise out of its thin clouds.\n\nA big, bright source of sunlight from one night will occur when the sun will completely shine at the same time that it does during the day, even as you would not be able to see it from the dark side of the moon, and the dark side would be just over 2 million kilometers away from the sun.\n\nIf we observe the surface of the Sun in daylight today, the entire length of the sky, it will be almost the same size it is this instant since we already know the Sun is almost entirely filled with water when it was first discovered and so has no longer been present at its closest point to the Sun.\n\nWe should all enjoy these long days when the sun is going deep and bright, but after we've lived for days in the shadow of the Earth, we are starting to wonder how the solar system could be so distant from the Sun at a time when our atmosphere is in the midst of a supernova like a supernova.","token_len":630,"entropy":[9.6142,4.3237,5.7946,3.718,1.377,6.5027,6.8737,0.9028,3.2589,4.524,5.4912,2.5456,8.0593,0.7995,1.4516,1.452,6.465,8.0739,7.302,0.5543,4.6198,4.9058,1.6143,2.2895,0.7591,2.4219,0.5726,8.3104,0.0572,6.944,5.0418,0.85,7.3013,16.2688,6.5217,6.7878,4.567,3.0558,2.7331,4.5781,6.7088,0.1492,0.6714,2.5488,0.0583,6.3661,4.4553,4.8921,0.6291,5.7438,0.157,0.8887,0.3046,1.291,7.4918,1.1063,0.6463,5.106,5.9928,1.6777,3.9047,2.5129,0.5204,3.5454,4.4629,1.2096,2.236,2.6668,1.9031,1.9318,0.4699,6.0877,0.344,2.2675,3.4714,0.4878,2.592,3.9206,3.996,3.9326,0.133,2.8311,2.5484,4.4132,0.7555,5.4375,5.4283,1.5841,0.0191,3.793,3.5938,4.8397,3.7151,3.0055,2.2971,5.6323,2.3381,1.2065,4.6966,0.0096,3.6196,1.1706,0.5782,0.8305,2.4999,5.0469,0.6604,2.8368,3.0086,4.7688,1.7043,5.5618,1.8154,0.0075,1.1409,5.6218,3.6189,2.9455,4.8324,1.104,2.7398,5.3263,4.6899,4.3463,4.8231,0.74,1.1151,6.8085,2.9651,0.0593,4.5154,0.0121,2.0174,4.221,4.091,0.9676,3.7662,3.3067,3.899,2.0537,0.0604,3.5256,0.5387,3.8617,1.9575,5.177,4.3444,2.5038,5.5279,4.7125,0.3133,1.3067,0.0003,1.9665,3.0929,3.8822,3.9974,3.9774,0.0492,0.018,1.0353,4.2416,0.567,0.2413,4.8612,5.9582,2.2746,3.7755,1.6387,3.9969,3.1634,4.9726,1.1306,0.8142,4.982,1.7822,3.3838,2.2685,2.2919,2.1679,3.3731,2.5397,1.1834,4.298,0.2691,3.1565,3.491,3.5915,0.0253,0.6987,0.1281,0.3123,1.7247,5.0026,4.3952,5.6631,2.3075,0.702,0.8045,3.687,4.8734,3.3048,4.3243,1.6462,0.3239,3.314,0.9471,2.738,1.341,1.856,2.4171,0.8725,1.4806,0.0003,4.9892,3.818,3.7143,5.1908,5.7493,2.5128,0.9445,3.9904,1.8938,0.9146,0.8516,0.7006,0.0296,1.8219,1.4596,0.5936,5.047,2.8513,0.2281,1.1879,0.4873,4.1806,0.0249,2.4267,2.9305,0.864,4.4437,2.5609,2.2021,0.2101,1.8617,5.9205,5.9961,2.5231,0.5655,2.4697,1.0863,1.6915,3.7163,4.365,2.7234,6.291,2.0138,3.968,5.8269,1.1374,2.6126,2.6194,2.0603,5.345,0.7598,5.0092,5.4261,2.9195,1.1225,0.7905,3.0512,0.2114,0.4009,3.6331,2.081,0.6918,2.5495,0.7393,1.1111,0.4117,0.4029,1.3868,0.0106,0.2546,0.6424,0.0003,2.0408,3.572,3.7141,2.6041,4.1707,1.3589,1.0989,2.7179,0.7273,1.1903,0.6808,1.5162,0.9488,0.2201,1.4726,5.3116,0.2112,4.3482,1.7669,0.8782,2.8389,4.7635,1.7647,5.8498,0.2384,2.1745,4.9281,1.6759,2.685,3.0844,1.8227,1.0486,1.1259,2.9364,1.1773,5.0188,4.4577,0.3132,0.796,2.309,6.4522,0.4717,1.7686,0.3633,5.0496,2.1968,3.3701,4.8928,3.4837,3.2458,2.8851,2.5092,4.1465,1.3013,1.4203,1.2143,5.8172,1.7186,4.552,2.3849,2.1149,4.5686,5.1931,2.3288,3.4145,0.1872,0.6032,0.0632,1.9545,0.8359,0.8865,0.0003,2.7885,5.8161,0.2221,4.8581,3.4194,1.7844,3.5907,6.2562,5.192,0.8764,2.5641,0.0231,0.8413,1.1264,0.734,3.5983,1.3072,1.0693,1.8315,1.8179,2.1206,0.799,4.0862,1.4377,2.4689,5.6008,2.5207,7.3029,2.6229,4.327,3.1774,3.9232,4.6248,0.4914,1.8202,3.6623,3.0277,0.0113,3.0971,0.6368,4.3773,3.8655,3.423,3.6841,0.7735,2.0157,5.4708,3.2677,0.7793,5.5052,3.3112,4.2019,0.3188,3.6965,6.1348,1.665,0.393,0.6823,1.4481,2.1083,0.3182,3.4007,1.3899,2.0564,1.5904,1.5105,5.7134,0.6475,4.1477,3.4231,0.3659,2.9002,5.6982,4.3505,0.7093,1.1173,0.0003,3.6042,3.8027,2.3374,1.9048,5.361,0.1341,1.7365,4.6303,6.2835,5.4726,1.0804,5.6525,2.4984,0.5344,0.342,2.4471,5.0357,4.9953,3.4367,1.5181,1.9391,0.2086,2.5501,1.4834,2.5767,3.7379,0.3779,0.6565,1.0173,5.5976,3.2715,6.3593,2.9763,2.7599,2.2863,0.352,0.0235,0.1928,1.1145,1.6236,1.1962,4.1315,0.537,0.3008,0.1876,2.4798,2.2574,2.8925,2.783,4.1529,0.2751,3.3892,1.0444,3.6653,3.877,4.118,3.9457,2.46,0.5756,1.2826,1.1781,0.6473,0.4072,0.6145,0.0002,3.3403,1.377,3.9231,1.3011,5.9657,0.2118,0.4319,3.1948,2.8243,4.5458,5.5133,0.4086,2.2254,5.0577,5.6826,0.0419,0.6052,3.0325,3.3202,2.6427,0.4036,0.833,3.6308,3.5319,0.3156,1.1291,5.3066,0.7095,6.7874,4.6151,5.7202,2.2936,4.4754,1.0241,1.7134,1.0282,0.7432,4.6369,3.8383,4.4401,0.0772,2.3256,4.4968,0.5536,3.2547,2.6468,3.477,3.9756,4.7292,3.7801,1.7763,4.9929,0.7844,4.4061,2.7528,3.5957,2.9212,0.612,1.01,0.4619,0.903,0.3969,0.4404,0.0002,2.8466,4.1967,4.7933,4.4617,4.5762,4.9733,2.4758,3.1814,0.9525,0.5236,1.0117,4.4255,6.6523,3.0642,2.0092,1.0273,2.0834,5.6496,2.9414,3.94,5.1487,2.1662,4.5273,2.1678,1.3466,2.5886,0.143,0.4577,2.9978,0.626,1.2154,2.6682,4.7662,0.0357,2.3784,2.0088,2.2705,3.0383,0.1297,3.2998,1.8368,0.7798,5.4295,0.7802,0.7378,0.7041,2.9077,3.522,1.4024,0.3504,3.1049,4.5537,0.5961,4.8152,2.2954,3.7786,0.0037,1.2656,2.5863,2.441,5.1325,2.873,1.4038,0.1157,0.6065]}

In 1895, the English began to export their pectoral plates to Britain, so some of the smaller plates remained in use throughout the world. Most European plates also came with a silver plate. German plates in 1900 were a few years too early, but in 1901, they were very popular.[11] The new silver plates came with a bronze, copper, gold and two French plates with the same appearance.[12]\n\nAfter France entered the French century, there was a lot of political discussion over the next 50 years.[13] The two main political parties, that of Louis XIV, and of Louis XVI, had an opposition to one another. The three most important parties were the Socialist Party (1839 - 1933, then as Socialist Government in 1953), the Left Party (1833 - 1918, then as Socialist Government in 1922; 1936 - 1962); the Catholic Church (1851 - 1963). The most notable political parties took up the project in 1963, but the left led by Bonaparte was not a serious contender during the time. There was little dissent in the Socialist Party, which took up the project during that first year. Other candidates such as the Liberal, Socialist, Social Democratic (Socialist-Socialist) and Catholic (Catholic) Parties (1917 - 1945) did also take up the campaign, but the Liberal Party dropped out of the project.\n\nFollowing several events, the Spanish government stopped purchasing German-made pectoral plates in 1913 and closed its factories in the country, leading to the formation of the Socialist Party (1853 - 1958. The Socialist government also closed off the main European factories to foreign production of the German-made silver plate and plate plate that was exported back and forth between Europe, to Britain and eventually to Germany.\n\nThe two political parties, the Socialist Party and the Catholic Church, also tried to hold positions of power on the Continent. However, in 1920 the party adopted a program of non-existence, with the goal of establishing an upper-middle class state in a French-speaking region.\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]","token_len":631,"entropy":[9.3708,10.8549,6.8124,8.9579,2.9832,9.8556,2.9999,5.5953,11.7803,3.4945,4.6785,8.3718,11.8544,9.4269,13.7387,9.4702,4.5461,0.7101,0.9055,2.5126,6.7173,7.7168,4.5894,5.2308,2.5717,4.3838,2.7984,1.492,3.6473,4.2838,9.3969,1.5602,7.8976,0.4963,3.5808,1.1838,2.2732,4.0708,4.4191,2.7062,6.4568,4.5233,5.3682,2.0301,4.6086,0.0125,0.2975,5.6483,3.2122,0.0739,2.8358,4.1733,4.0365,5.3612,4.1995,5.8691,5.4501,3.5614,2.4971,5.1226,1.1254,4.708,6.398,5.2117,1.3257,2.9553,4.6088,1.9987,2.9608,3.1016,2.4412,0.8378,4.4708,1.1136,3.7414,0.9075,4.0339,0.9979,4.6688,3.2043,5.5618,0.8184,7.1914,3.4992,1.7172,2.649,0.1321,3.2928,4.2976,3.0252,6.2836,0.4027,2.8152,0.1059,0.2733,5.6644,0.2426,0.1144,1.5154,2.3207,6.5532,1.7667,0.1598,0.3539,0.4331,4.9153,1.2014,4.0997,4.0156,1.9531,4.2848,4.5325,0.2056,0.0759,1.4426,5.2828,1.8853,4.9001,1.3391,0.258,0.1001,4.0382,4.1809,5.0322,2.8232,1.9567,3.906,3.7105,3.1969,0.6538,4.3244,4.8172,1.6235,5.949,0.8348,5.5766,2.309,3.5354,0.4106,0.0226,0.4873,5.4926,2.128,5.0531,2.6487,3.4077,5.5341,0.9015,5.2583,4.4045,0.4483,0.3359,5.3165,5.0554,1.6289,5.7199,4.5997,0.081,4.7239,2.6609,3.8436,3.5835,2.0984,0.2313,0.1152,1.1705,0.0005,5.8532,0.846,2.5175,0.0056,6.1858,2.8407,0.6418,1.1988,0.9249,1.1858,1.9641,0.0021,0.0695,0.2115,1.2032,4.4042,3.337,3.4758,0.0839,4.9498,5.1655,1.721,3.8586,0.309,1.9804,3.2095,2.7481,4.1271,2.9628,4.6309,3.6061,2.7215,2.3419,2.2653,1.0921,2.3133,4.4805,0.8693,1.414,2.2248,2.8457,1.1036,4.956,2.2179,6.4166,3.7476,0.3146,0.2865,0.9674,4.0454,1.11,4.4381,6.2593,0.9432,0.6426,2.4669,1.4212,5.5692,0.5778,3.2338,3.7671,0.3283,2.9138,0.858,5.2415,4.2367,0.737,5.1982,2.2585,1.1482,1.4983,4.7221,2.424,1.9219,5.4195,0.851,3.909,4.7062,1.1046,3.9843,3.9353,0.5485,4.3739,2.8076,1.9383,1.574,3.2136,3.3767,1.7051,2.2303,0.7986,5.3253,1.2039,2.3495,0.1675,0.0887,2.2214,4.6085,3.9008,0.9889,3.0521,0.5707,0.9219,3.5814,4.035,3.9905,1.0358,3.4571,0.91,6.2471,4.87,1.1182,3.4609,2.6672,2.1608,4.9583,1.7491,0.0828,0.0726,0.8941,0.0002,4.8202,5.9537,3.7183,0.8586,5.054,5.509,0.5536,3.6421,0.8754,0.6881,4.6745,0.1263,5.6563,5.6215,3.4268,0.8204,5.6929,3.7921,0.0506,2.9982,0.1159,0.1385,1.7081,5.4036,2.0978,2.5471,0.3815,1.7276,6.4355,0.894,2.2562,1.5083,2.2764,1.5105,2.4355,1.1135,1.2769,0.2209,3.2149,4.2886,3.9907,1.4235,6.4634,0.1184,1.53,1.5083,5.7634,3.0606,1.5274,1.6498,1.3211,0.7408,2.7372,0.55,1.4463,2.1206,4.7164,4.918,4.3657,3.5052,5.0513,4.298,2.7199,5.5517,1.6858,5.3102,1.0352,0.3689,4.0633,1.2164,0.2328,0.6183,4.4371,0.1444,4.9502,0.7088,0.1409,0.2896,2.2295,0.1091,0.2508,3.0455,5.0582,5.8121,0.3474,4.5214,3.8275,1.0736,3.1499,0.9641,0.3326,0.4551,4.1986,0.0675,4.2779,3.8119,1.1872,3.5172,4.2038,2.535,1.6164,6.2994,2.8839,0.8874,5.6453,2.2678,3.8885,0.9195,1.988,2.0725,4.0978,5.6348,0.7164,5.7577,0.1029,0.0224,1.9228,2.6423,3.1131,3.1999,0.9108,4.6907,0.7211,3.7396,1.2016,4.916,1.0273,3.88,5.6111,1.5829,0.5775,3.7069,0.4144,1.4261,2.0248,4.1018,0.4123,0.2487,0.5782,4.053,3.9552,5.3482,2.135,1.4426,6.2114,5.1078,4.1129,0.0029,2.0693,4.7078,4.9441,3.0148,0.9966,3.1335,1.4903,3.3281,3.0107,0.3975,3.288,2.7184,0.4057,1.3495,0.196,3.2206,2.7593,0.5679,0.7359,2.8016,3.0725,2.6271,3.7434,0.313,3.2787,0.2305,3.578,5.9979,1.6316,0.0759,0.0505,5.4192,1.8323,0.8215,2.1262,3.148,1.1637,5.869,0.3329,1.3468,0.3577,1.8768,1.517,1.0971,0.0002,5.4006,6.9029,5.6427,1.1778,0.6976,4.7105,1.6178,5.4086,4.6173,1.7482,2.973,0.5865,3.3065,0.0085,0.0076,0.0375,1.2569,4.2579,2.1687,4.7794,3.0408,2.8271,1.2703,2.0977,3.0603,2.2632,3.9508,0.0856,1.1675,4.5758,0.0115,0.5295,3.0309,0.8085,1.9757,1.8013,3.6253,0.4062,4.0689,5.2956,1.6529,1.8422,3.6349,2.8936,2.0206,4.5408,1.2902,4.3403,5.347,2.2704,2.1665,3.4923,2.911,4.1529,2.1579,2.5046,1.4237,0.2425,6.112,1.4666,2.9412,4.2344,3.225,4.9985,1.9198,3.8465,4.4267,4.3121,0.0066,1.3177,2.9043,3.4059,4.2732,3.7121,0.6743,6.1943,0.747,2.7432,1.7573,2.1525,0.0002,1.5085,5.2282,4.8776,0.0842,2.6142,1.4411,1.6635,0.8253,0.8603,0.1848,0.5692,0.1091,0.5548,3.667,4.1358,0.1689,5.1594,5.5576,2.1419,0.4552,3.4779,0.8364,4.1462,1.1689,3.3608,0.0711,2.8951,4.2831,1.6512,4.2653,5.1518,0.7724,4.5107,0.4788,4.7507,0.0649,5.4728,1.4349,3.4338,1.0274,3.2319,0.0836,3.4707,2.5128,5.3408,2.3948,1.1176,0.1655,3.6675,1.4193,4.2112,5.1395,0.9409,0.1578,2.6499,1.3762,2.5014,0.0002,5.7323,1.2452,0.0126,0.0024,1.0265,0.0003,2.8133,0.0803,0.0006,0.0004]}
{"id":1221,"ended":true,"length":603,"gen_text":"The series was given a budget of $ 100 million ( \u00a3 58 million ), the largest both HBO and the BBC had ever devoted to a series. The season was filmed between 2008 and 2009 in London in the year 2000 \/ 2006, filming the opening episode, \"The City of Flowers\". In 2008, the series was extended to follow Harry Potter actor Renny Black, a character who could change into an entirely new character after his father was killed or left behind after his death. The book series is well worth looking at on what might have been, as was the show's second half.\n\nA number of the major companies involved in the series (such as Fox Searchlight UK, The BBC, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm\/Verve Ltd, BBC Worldwide, Aereo, Telepathy International), including Fox Entertainment, Fox Music Ltd, Warner Music UK and Warner Music UK Entertainment, have either signed off on or received royalties from the series, while the BBC, who acquired rights to the series after it was released, have not.\n\nWhat is interesting about TV news about some of the series is its portrayal of politics. The first half of the television series, when Harry Potter enters the Wizarding world, tells of the battle between the wizard and the Dursleys. Harry Potter is a highly political character, one who tends to be taken with the most leniency in the Potter way of life. It is said that Harry Potter is \"the most divisive character in human history.\"\n\nEven more interesting is that at one point in time, Harry Potter was the youngest person to be cast in a major TV series, and one of the only non-Wizard characters to have won an Academy Award - he himself went on to play a wizard in a number of popular films - and this is certainly something that is expected from a child of the Middle Ages.\n\nThis season's 'Lord Of The Flies', which premiered in January 2012, also sees Harry Potter playing an American villain (played by Alan Tudyk) who fights against the White Death, and he even makes it clear that he is an evil wizard. However, he does have a few minor side-effects that are far less surprising given his age, including some sort of supernatural ailment. This isn't surprising as we are talking about something that was never intended for television: a character often portrayed as both one who is evil and evil for who and what he has become, and one who will not ever truly be evil. The series is more than just a television series.\n\nOther characters, such as Hermione Granger, who has been killed during the events of the series - and then returned as a part of the Weasley family after the Battle of Hogwarts, does come into our picture - include the Wizarding War criminal, the King Of Slytherin, who is the father of the Weasley children, and the Lord Voldemort, Voldemort's nephew (played by Anthony Hopkins) who was once a student at the school, and is no longer a student there. It is no coincidence that the books the series was made up of have a major part in the Harry Potter canon.","token_len":632,"entropy":[7.6021,2.9888,5.5686,1.1091,5.8586,0.0763,0.7603,11.8827,0.4426,4.6156,9.5136,5.4203,0.2225,2.0584,3.9504,3.7064,10.3188,9.4044,0.036,3.4468,2.035,2.0546,0.3308,6.8438,0.2189,1.0169,1.8233,0.7706,1.9463,6.9068,2.4837,3.6059,3.4188,4.558,0.2256,2.024,2.2902,2.5635,4.446,1.5342,5.3652,2.0632,7.8895,3.4963,1.6539,5.2612,3.18,4.3594,1.5973,2.9245,0.8482,1.4471,5.8655,1.1474,4.2959,1.6841,2.9168,3.6452,0.6237,1.2148,1.4972,0.6384,5.2845,0.3541,5.6579,6.2663,1.1694,4.5744,4.9614,5.041,2.6653,1.7661,3.5049,3.7035,1.2349,5.8857,4.8141,2.495,3.3865,5.0869,0.6358,1.7946,3.1473,2.6573,2.7157,2.9964,0.5509,5.7552,4.568,1.5441,3.6741,2.1795,2.0536,0.4043,1.669,5.7109,1.9056,3.7622,5.6957,3.0825,4.6513,0.3715,4.8812,7.1589,4.3837,0.7312,0.3803,2.1611,3.2817,4.774,0.6544,3.9309,0.6959,3.8411,3.7374,1.0593,1.1825,0.1895,3.9709,3.7239,0.0101,3.1968,4.1641,5.257,1.9084,0.5605,0.3965,1.1457,3.4886,3.3537,0.0021,4.2473,3.7055,0.0003,6.0094,0.5608,4.5733,3.9013,0.7014,5.291,1.7009,0.66,4.6903,0.1127,4.9936,3.7207,3.3283,5.3747,0.8371,5.0751,0.9181,0.7983,5.9125,3.6593,0.9191,5.5103,5.8714,4.4017,4.5029,1.9779,3.9232,4.606,0.7364,4.396,3.7715,4.9973,0.3942,3.2949,1.811,2.5551,1.3884,1.4381,0.6558,1.7057,4.57,0.4911,1.8137,4.7749,3.2155,2.5426,0.1993,0.8369,5.4035,4.4989,0.376,0.2075,0.5953,1.7615,4.0278,2.2017,1.408,2.6804,4.1659,5.759,2.788,0.8142,0.2562,0.7409,3.6821,1.7878,0.551,2.8795,0.806,2.9135,1.2504,1.0701,0.9411,0.0002,5.1676,1.6534,3.0556,1.2514,7.2421,4.9914,4.062,6.795,0.2914,0.3727,2.9487,0.404,3.7689,5.7586,0.0728,5.2998,1.3037,1.8153,2.9738,2.9532,0.3948,0.2945,5.2769,0.4254,2.2733,4.7369,1.2898,0.1001,4.5961,1.0526,2.8561,0.0077,1.9206,0.4848,5.6963,2.3287,1.3652,4.4379,0.6298,1.1551,1.522,2.3599,0.4622,5.7118,0.1051,0.1068,2.0365,2.8932,0.7805,1.585,2.272,5.1097,3.0166,0.2684,0.8136,4.0592,0.63,5.7075,0.1676,1.7763,4.4419,2.5121,2.0871,2.7625,3.8781,2.1291,2.3975,1.6965,5.1926,6.2748,0.5865,0.3,0.7207,3.4782,0.6925,3.8021,0.3048,2.2869,0.9581,1.7193,4.1943,1.9045,1.4987,4.5883,1.0936,0.6315,4.7637,0.0363,2.8085,2.019,0.0003,5.7008,2.6805,1.1265,0.6769,1.6276,4.9463,2.3018,0.1382,1.3074,3.9574,0.4364,1.5184,0.1837,0.8847,2.3953,4.595,2.9086,1.1463,1.6011,2.3101,0.8983,0.6053,1.5923,1.4565,0.9558,1.3978,1.6703,3.9424,0.4648,0.1886,2.9677,4.6369,0.0278,4.8073,0.1339,1.272,0.966,1.6783,3.5716,0.9594,1.0726,0.0484,5.9959,3.9451,6.0034,4.5669,0.1252,0.0236,2.5304,1.8591,2.6049,1.3487,2.429,4.7635,0.0046,3.2831,1.6751,3.6952,1.0432,4.8967,1.7867,5.1844,2.5992,0.7496,2.0683,4.4428,1.6923,0.9256,3.8875,1.4861,1.5696,4.5704,0.0131,0.449,1.0039,0.0003,3.6756,5.1308,2.098,6.0529,5.5755,3.6312,0.0372,1.4637,0.1074,2.5323,1.7727,4.1544,1.2897,3.0414,3.0015,0.2832,3.9732,3.6649,1.0638,0.1588,3.3933,2.6584,5.195,5.8008,3.8115,2.4745,0.0257,5.4413,0.4229,0.0,1.2788,1.1633,5.6791,2.3872,1.1587,5.3551,4.9095,2.1087,1.9315,3.5212,5.2582,3.6276,3.0024,1.6494,0.4321,0.4425,1.2528,3.9373,3.568,1.1759,1.0876,3.99,0.0961,2.5672,2.2347,2.856,1.0006,3.0542,3.6327,3.3194,1.0896,1.218,2.697,1.6398,4.7477,1.6624,4.5759,3.6026,1.1596,3.7623,1.6985,2.7278,4.3765,4.196,0.0006,5.1212,5.1893,0.0,1.4573,3.7471,4.2083,0.0011,3.2667,2.799,3.8338,2.7143,4.1629,0.125,4.4248,0.5444,2.4636,2.9909,3.3223,2.3833,3.32,4.6472,1.8185,2.0839,6.2014,1.7436,0.5521,5.7069,6.0438,2.4925,1.4267,2.6947,0.1966,2.3268,4.7919,3.985,4.6844,0.9696,0.3065,4.7805,1.3523,2.3502,1.1562,2.114,0.1853,4.2744,3.9877,4.7903,3.6461,0.8398,2.0404,0.8011,3.5692,1.9986,1.7019,5.3846,2.2291,1.528,0.7782,4.3357,0.813,1.9646,1.196,0.0003,5.4768,3.2894,3.3974,0.8233,0.001,4.1243,0.0821,0.7021,2.5063,2.6922,1.6498,4.6239,3.5296,0.4998,2.4882,0.0951,0.5,1.5309,4.5372,2.1029,4.9215,3.9176,2.4346,1.2003,3.5682,0.0548,0.405,4.0823,0.3122,3.0794,1.9006,5.0407,0.0297,0.2089,2.3025,5.7475,4.2362,2.062,5.5751,4.0429,3.6,4.1934,2.466,5.0054,0.1164,2.5672,5.7158,1.7324,2.3418,5.5805,5.4941,2.9283,0.0002,0.0432,0.3868,2.1237,1.2347,2.7401,3.6771,0.1002,1.3426,3.6399,2.3387,0.4663,0.8598,1.1252,4.8665,1.2153,0.491,6.0676,0.2077,5.0907,4.0926,1.8147,0.0375,4.3757,0.0471,2.0366,0.598,2.2738,2.9094,1.4913,3.3771,0.9254,2.4637,2.2173,2.2965,0.8871,2.3233,5.5616,0.1481,2.0248,1.3778,3.6798,0.4426,3.8124,0.5451,4.687,1.721,0.1414,1.3462,4.9345,5.5786,0.8825,2.3005,4.3131,4.4842,0.1832,3.2354,2.5159,4.7533,3.0375,0.9522,0.7657,3.1269,0.0082,2.3632,0.8362]}
{"id":3660,"ended":true,"length":605,"gen_text":"The film faced allegations of plagiarism with similarities to Terminator 2 : Judgment Day ( 1991 ), the Batman series, Iron Man ( 2008 ), The Sorcerer's Apprentice ( 2010 ) and 'Captain America: Civil War'( 2010 ). But many sources cited by the Hollywood Reporter report that both films' original screenplay also contained \"very poor\" scenes.\n\nThe script, which could be described as using an entirely different setting for both films was written without regard to any specific director. The book also didn't include any comments on what he wanted to do with the characters. The story has no specific reference to any particular city being portrayed in the book. (For more details on the movie and its various plot points, check out this post by Chris B. Cox)\n\nThe director's office confirmed to the Hollywood Reporter on Tuesday that \"Batman: The Killing Joke\" was in fact written by the director but did not list its names. The Los Angeles Police Department declined to interview the scriptwriter. As part of its investigation, however, the Los Angeles Unified School District called its school district.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Giamatti's biography of the director on the screenplay's website, the script was a direct response to the controversy over his performance when he was asked if he intended to put the character to one side. When asked if he meant \"a side,\" Batman stated, \"The other is the evil side. Sometimes we just say the two ways and we end up having those things.\" When the scriptwriter asked if this meant \"as a side,\" as opposed to the other way that the character was portrayed, Batman replied \"The other is the good side. Sometimes we just say the two places, then we find the way it is meant to be.\"\n\nGiamatti's involvement in Batman: The Killing Joke is in dispute in many ways. In 2008, director Zack Snyder ( Batman: The Killing Joke ) suggested that Warner Bros. wanted to make the script by himself, but the project was terminated. (I am told by several people briefed on the project's development that during that negotiation, Snyder left the company when Warner Bros. rejected the idea.)\n\nThere's also something rather strange happening with Batman: The Return of Henry Cavill. The movie has been on hold filming, possibly indefinitely, as it was being rewritten for director Christopher Nolan's next Batman film, The Dark Knight Rises. (The script now comes to fruition via an attached IMAX release.) According to Giamatti, the movie isn't slated to open in theaters until August.\n\nFor his part, Zack Snyder said that the story was \"in a great hurry,\" that there would be a production delay, and that he \"felt comfortable with my script.\" However, he acknowledged that all of these things might happen, saying that the script was \"in a little bit of a bind.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Warner Bros. insisted to The Hollywood Reporter that \"no new news\" about the director's exit comes from Warner Bros.

This was during the first 11 days of the offseason when the offense, defense, and special teams all had a bye week before being officially announced.

The film then returned to theaters in the U.S. on May 23, 2005, to take home its second major domestic grossing weekend.\n\nIn addition to its theatrical release, the film also opened in France where it held on to its first major international total (A- A-C) and to a $5.2 million total day, reaching $17.1 million worldwide in 11 days.\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nList of releases [ edit ]","token_len":633,"entropy":[8.9315,5.5429,3.0307,3.8194,3.9344,5.9133,2.3004,1.1507,6.0494,0.5749,2.5905,0.6056,7.2269,3.9944,0.3988,3.3912,0.6953,6.5481,0.8377,3.0663,3.8197,0.6095,3.6184,8.3438,0.662,0.5839,1.2699,1.6379,7.7286,3.6158,7.0729,1.033,0.3139,2.5676,3.0179,7.4876,0.7356,2.4723,5.8887,2.4213,1.3624,4.5037,2.3442,3.7274,0.6119,1.5568,0.7417,1.5914,2.0766,3.2642,0.0982,3.3488,1.9101,0.2512,0.2754,2.939,0.4083,0.8285,1.7193,0.373,4.6021,1.9118,1.5983,0.8623,4.5275,6.5971,4.9131,0.1464,3.4357,0.2847,1.3823,0.6482,3.1241,4.0058,0.3297,4.6742,1.4345,1.4967,0.0091,4.8597,0.0157,4.1757,1.8262,1.1764,1.7164,0.7529,3.8125,1.7722,5.8841,2.7744,5.5746,4.7205,4.3939,0.2182,1.5827,2.1006,4.6879,2.789,1.3,5.2812,0.6259,5.5013,2.0354,4.482,2.0359,4.2441,3.1856,1.3068,5.8539,0.6201,1.2487,2.7956,2.8111,2.9151,0.0195,0.8435,0.1638,0.8013,0.2784,3.3946,1.5325,5.6374,4.8648,3.7877,1.8471,3.4844,2.1484,4.4958,3.8204,3.8127,2.7826,4.807,5.1796,0.2695,3.5034,2.0123,3.2803,0.1262,2.5418,4.8861,5.3894,5.7528,4.5808,1.5251,1.2163,1.548,8.3467,0.3155,6.7972,4.7469,3.4761,0.7666,4.8319,5.1568,0.7495,0.8986,1.3212,0.4317,2.3585,1.3933,6.9376,0.7003,3.0949,2.1672,0.9683,2.2032,2.3155,0.2331,0.405,0.8289,0.1381,1.7175,2.9249,6.4701,1.717,4.7635,1.1069,3.9523,1.5632,2.3751,0.6918,1.9823,0.0072,0.7764,0.1253,0.0674,0.0003,1.8572,0.0289,0.0116,0.0052,0.0324,0.0057,0.0025,0.0055,0.1338,0.0095,0.0096,0.0012,0.0947,0.0027,0.0022,0.0004,0.0005,0.0046,0.008,0.0034,0.0036,0.026,0.001,0.038,0.0269,0.0037,0.0013,0.003,0.0017,0.0006,0.0001,0.001,0.0013,0.0016,0.046,0.0005,0.0017,0.0032,0.0008,0.0015,0.0041,0.0068,0.0008,4.3559,4.6604,5.866,2.48,3.8765,3.8518,4.0973,4.1801,3.3591,2.8896,0.0419,3.7459,2.6691,3.2445,4.1888,2.9487,0.1294,4.1004,1.7408,2.3731,2.5206,0.3389,5.6459,6.3127,6.157,5.8481,0.6139,1.0234,3.5782,0.8628,4.6105,1.6829,4.6674,3.2595,4.5855,0.8854,3.6123,1.3058,1.601,1.8714,0.4287,1.2825,0.0003,2.1202,0.7151,1.2987,5.9446,0.7699,1.0495,4.6471,0.1416,0.2407,0.0629,1.3697,0.2307,5.3635,1.8894,1.341,1.2598,2.6261,2.0622,0.0146,5.9539,3.987,2.966,0.7285,0.0095,1.9166,4.9148,2.6895,2.5877,0.0604,1.0632,1.4085,2.1378,2.6901,0.201,3.8967,4.631,1.1331,3.7978,4.6118,2.4046,1.7209,3.3566,3.1723,2.042,1.376,2.8697,1.1603,4.7698,1.2183,5.4834,6.049,1.7757,2.3524,3.7261,1.916,0.8566,1.1203,5.7691,3.8404,0.4651,0.1387,0.7176,3.5011,3.237,4.2413,3.1448,0.0257,3.0761,1.6622,4.409,4.6536,0.8733,1.7401,0.6151,4.721,2.1365,5.2995,0.5161,2.4943,0.9439,1.5952,0.7015,3.6458,2.3143,3.8138,0.0953,0.6216,1.15,0.1648,2.715,3.3667,1.884,2.7163,1.8129,6.6686,8.2901,0.3034,0.2456,0.0573,3.7598,0.0045,2.6572,2.267,1.5097,0.0034,0.4089,0.3407,3.0515,0.6955,3.0017,1.3668,0.5165,2.7256,3.2519,1.4736,5.5846,0.0025,4.7681,1.579,4.9578,4.3574,5.3072,4.543,3.9103,4.6774,4.8042,2.5969,4.2621,4.645,1.9785,3.4385,2.721,9.1956,0.6172,2.3534,4.8497,0.2157,2.5147,0.3152,1.3213,1.4907,0.2164,2.8093,5.0246,1.546,4.9555,0.6515,2.2951,0.6595,5.3418,0.5807,3.4359,3.572,0.6636,2.676,3.2463,0.1067,2.0015,0.4861,6.3908,4.746,2.6739,1.7915,1.5565,2.12,4.2733,1.2283,5.5543,2.597,0.0001,2.442,0.544,0.9913,2.797,4.9566,4.6734,0.8342,0.0003,1.7133,0.4343,6.2613,0.5835,1.8951,1.7379,5.7779,0.018,4.7451,6.041,0.7058,1.6408,4.1872,2.8191,2.1475,5.084,2.1461,0.2079,0.7955,2.1552,4.0375,4.3464,5.1265,3.1623,0.5886,1.5532,0.5477,6.0906,0.578,2.1708,0.0008,0.0735,0.0286,2.7882,0.7545,1.814,3.6875,0.1269,1.1104,1.1341,4.1092,0.0951,1.4475,5.3884,1.1441,3.0033,0.0065,0.2617,0.028,3.2903,6.2789,4.7454,2.8652,0.013,3.7209,1.2024,0.4251,5.2733,5.7229,2.1376,0.5395,6.3459,0.0432,3.1799,1.0755,4.3324,0.0634,0.6572,0.1516,1.6279,6.2015,6.4036,1.7159,4.1588,4.6155,2.4786,0.9616,0.6338,0.0046,1.9476,1.8615,4.0415,1.4024,0.9248,1.5674,0.2108,4.4373,4.805,0.24,1.423,1.0245,1.7459,0.2959,0.0009,0.4502,0.4222,1.1236,1.0683,2.7442,0.354,0.257,0.7615,3.674,2.9807,0.9571,2.4879,2.3764,5.3727,3.267,2.9917,1.6961,3.1033,1.57,1.1105,0.0003,2.5664,2.7254,0.2406,1.1809,1.6414,0.1073,0.1264,0.6668,0.0433,1.3953,2.6058,0.7587,4.6863,5.9337,0.175,4.4401,1.8886,0.9217,0.4922,3.5831,2.6439,0.9814,4.8607,3.7518,3.9793,3.5356,6.7141,1.6045,5.0966,1.8321,1.6562,4.4587,1.9328,4.8483,3.403,0.219,2.1716,0.0226,2.819,5.9068,3.4133,4.9424,1.5513,4.0143,0.3704,2.4889,0.0101,1.8886,2.8704,5.2919,0.713,0.51,1.943,0.0002,5.8719,2.2258,0.0006,0.0022,1.5189,0.0006,5.9611,0.0922,5.1421,0.7177,0.0007,0.0008]}
{"id":1486,"ended":true,"length":605,"gen_text":"In the early seventies, the capabilities of AI programs were limited. Even the most impressive could only handle trivial versions of the problems they were supposed to solve ; all the programs were very small and could only perform one thing: find the missing binary. Even simple tasks like running a web service would require very powerful tools to find those missing binary values.\n\nThis time, IBM's AI could not do that. It required an even bigger robot.\n\nHow did IBM learn to code?\n\nIn the mid-Nineties, IBM's computer industry was beginning to unravel. The IBM AI was already capable of performing many tasks, but with so few features that it was hard to understand and solve problems. IBM's research efforts culminated in the creation of a completely autonomous system, called NeuralNet, that could solve these challenges. As a result, the AI was created in collaboration with other firms like HP Systems Ltd., IBM Computer, and HP Advanced Systems Services Ltd. The company is now working on a product, called Deep Data, using deep learning to analyze images and determine their significance.\n\nAt the same time, IBM found that neural networks were inefficient and difficult to use. This meant that its AI had to learn to program based on the needs of customers, rather than trying to solve problems using algorithms.\n\nIn the near-future, deep learning will solve tasks in many different way. Deep learning is the latest development in AI, which means the AI will provide human-like understanding of problem solving. Deep learning is also rapidly advancing, because it is more efficient as well, meaning more human-looking machines are developed. By applying machine learning to problems, IBM's AI can learn to learn from data and understand it as a whole.\n\nHow does AI stack up against other machine learning systems?\n\nMany machine learning systems run in a very different space than conventional ones. Machine learning relies on the assumption that an algorithm can find a solution to a problem that it can understand and apply to other computer systems. The goal of this type of system is to develop new algorithms that apply the same techniques to any information system. IBM's Machine Learning system used to help it solve many complex problems at once. IBM's AI can now deal with very high levels of complexity with only one tool.\n\nMachine learning systems can be developed for almost any problem. When you run code from several machines, your software must write and build all of its data, but it will not ever make a decision about which system to use first. Machine Learning has a high probability of working, but it is slow. In a high probability of running, your software will run at a speed that is too slow for that particular system, and so it can't understand how it came down to dealing with the task at hand. As more human-oriented systems are added, so will the number of them, and ultimately the rate at which they move forward. A successful AI system will do a good job of dealing with new features, new problems and better alternatives. This makes new challenges difficult in the near future, since no one will ever know how to solve them correctly.","token_len":634,"entropy":[2.6222,4.0638,6.0935,0.1916,0.2404,1.9697,12.1733,0.1077,7.0231,5.741,1.2641,3.4506,1.6433,4.7722,2.3919,2.2935,6.2219,7.5712,1.702,3.9182,7.0572,10.3784,0.1287,2.2601,5.1283,2.854,1.2436,2.4852,0.0004,0.126,10.5078,5.9038,1.5895,4.6394,1.7032,4.7834,2.608,1.0952,3.1313,0.6115,2.7269,2.62,3.108,2.9572,3.7704,1.367,4.4781,6.0658,0.9084,4.3923,5.2983,3.3122,1.3563,4.6037,0.8956,3.6811,3.3779,3.2676,1.2258,3.0815,4.9108,3.8303,1.7744,2.6352,5.4309,0.4287,1.2436,4.5203,0.3141,1.6797,0.0933,3.2773,5.3068,0.7996,4.1439,1.8009,1.8277,4.9402,3.5027,2.1192,2.0003,0.5661,2.1829,4.5412,3.0604,3.5583,2.2747,5.6441,1.1736,1.6125,0.0002,5.402,1.8324,2.0644,4.1609,0.7218,3.5152,0.8073,1.0028,0.0002,2.2027,1.3965,2.5783,0.2113,5.1445,0.0152,0.1559,1.0254,2.2207,3.7422,5.1302,1.3724,3.8661,0.0194,5.2652,0.3377,1.9237,4.2361,2.0372,1.3279,3.8665,3.9398,0.0386,3.3865,2.4138,1.4158,1.7174,0.7851,4.6203,3.9055,1.9553,4.3916,2.1096,0.5601,1.1094,2.3318,0.1124,3.3934,3.1856,4.5567,2.4801,1.3128,2.2109,1.6199,5.05,3.1884,5.4904,0.1785,0.6535,2.1089,0.014,1.966,5.339,4.7139,2.6428,2.3119,0.9368,6.5823,3.7978,1.0089,1.3077,1.3863,2.8299,2.8932,3.3488,0.7945,4.4305,1.576,0.0872,0.2534,1.3762,2.3531,1.2324,4.4714,1.8477,4.1356,0.0242,3.8242,4.3358,3.8897,4.9777,6.8998,6.0519,1.3368,2.1883,3.0371,2.4264,1.1493,4.2096,4.6801,2.7213,6.2401,1.1385,0.3853,2.4919,2.9918,4.5069,0.5484,2.071,0.6377,1.1529,4.4825,4.3107,0.5084,3.0397,5.6327,1.0943,6.541,2.9254,0.3027,1.1696,4.406,5.1073,1.4463,5.3211,2.9921,3.4888,0.4206,0.6755,0.0002,4.6998,0.6447,1.2189,0.0019,0.0937,1.0853,6.6347,1.6248,5.0096,1.0547,1.3891,5.8023,1.7855,2.8455,0.0352,1.5985,0.381,3.43,2.2897,0.3654,3.3614,1.4083,3.0087,0.176,1.7514,1.4777,2.9289,5.6759,0.0263,1.7536,3.2089,0.1128,5.6963,2.0011,1.1416,0.003,5.3165,0.0561,1.3208,1.1149,3.7877,2.9223,0.9889,1.8825,0.0002,2.3545,1.6799,6.0901,1.6961,1.0598,0.0359,3.6077,0.1038,1.4028,4.9941,5.825,2.6439,2.8515,0.4512,5.474,0.8067,3.4665,0.6323,2.0495,2.4862,4.4195,3.7649,0.4097,2.5442,1.4506,2.442,3.1503,3.9999,3.0761,0.9161,6.207,5.4038,0.8052,1.1578,3.4936,0.4167,4.5601,2.0445,1.3809,2.577,0.209,1.5119,1.4814,5.5418,2.4258,1.0362,3.8738,1.0495,1.2529,3.3242,1.8069,5.4374,2.1785,3.2339,4.3916,2.644,3.042,0.5154,6.3752,3.5754,1.9312,3.9758,0.5732,5.3255,4.8513,3.0316,0.0331,1.2383,2.3759,0.4334,1.4684,2.347,0.4619,1.1316,1.7522,1.1904,4.1473,1.4603,3.9449,1.6868,3.1652,1.8838,3.6359,2.3336,0.3964,0.2862,0.5322,0.0002,2.6833,1.8587,3.1742,5.2288,0.0149,0.4579,1.2889,2.6212,0.0735,1.0039,0.1717,0.0223,0.0002,4.2145,2.7919,0.0086,0.6505,5.5758,2.7467,2.2878,2.5722,0.896,4.4728,1.7938,5.9102,0.9608,0.3952,2.7271,0.0464,4.1039,0.171,2.3455,3.1554,0.0595,3.5821,1.5451,1.6127,3.1511,1.2542,1.8254,1.0166,0.4051,0.3885,3.3204,1.7139,1.6651,2.5043,2.1298,3.0345,1.2245,2.7921,5.3882,0.792,0.3206,2.784,3.568,0.6752,2.8228,3.0079,0.0138,1.0567,0.1097,0.2141,4.6923,2.6756,1.4382,0.9885,5.7504,1.8235,1.6278,4.031,1.0742,3.9858,5.7465,3.6069,0.9274,5.145,0.4915,4.3962,0.0483,1.9381,4.8566,0.9701,4.9826,3.3505,1.3775,2.4431,3.2816,0.3455,4.5429,0.6184,0.7987,4.2317,0.9202,1.903,2.7791,1.6538,5.0742,0.0606,4.2902,5.3456,3.342,0.0028,0.7702,3.6578,2.8761,3.048,4.1052,1.2195,0.7935,0.0001,1.8046,0.4785,2.6025,1.9725,2.2261,4.202,2.9459,3.5691,0.1508,1.8482,1.4983,4.6362,2.4533,3.9728,6.2222,2.3754,6.9177,2.3521,0.6373,3.23,4.3095,4.5092,5.2778,4.0037,4.6624,4.6865,1.3288,1.6973,2.6898,3.0136,3.2473,1.9041,2.8699,1.51,5.0639,4.8614,1.9085,0.8021,1.1369,1.2482,3.7139,0.5673,0.6755,4.39,0.1791,3.1424,1.9414,3.5366,2.3339,3.7822,2.5651,0.235,2.578,1.7223,1.0672,0.865,1.4998,3.9573,1.6617,2.9837,3.0366,3.9119,3.7181,2.3999,4.0783,1.0344,2.776,1.588,0.9153,2.77,2.45,1.2857,2.6219,0.9417,0.7824,2.2237,0.5025,1.1391,5.5864,1.852,2.1564,2.9133,1.0113,3.3948,1.2874,3.4115,1.1147,3.832,2.8672,1.9066,3.4452,5.5131,0.187,5.7315,0.0047,1.6401,5.3522,0.3178,0.0014,0.0901,4.3365,4.9637,6.4636,0.4452,3.6036,1.1641,1.2071,3.4908,1.2467,3.2478,0.3052,0.7863,2.4472,0.0395,6.3263,2.1295,0.774,5.5721,0.9496,5.3266,0.2488,0.0018,0.6236,6.2861,2.52,0.22,5.1751,5.6005,1.4737,0.8737,0.7263,4.8828,2.898,2.7429,0.0459,0.6118,3.1033,0.0032,5.1298,4.9047,1.3874,3.0496,1.0436,3.1588,6.9417,5.3038,0.6546,4.0146,3.4496,6.8169,5.1739,3.6379,4.9002,0.9656,3.1041,0.2276,1.053,4.0653,5.4626,1.1377,1.8604,0.8644,1.0817,1.5057,0.6558,0.8233,1.2908,4.9318,0.3785]}
{"id":3222,"ended":true,"length":603,"gen_text":"In May 2006, former Sports Illustrated writer Jeff Pearlman released a revealing biography of Bonds entitled Love Me, Hate Me : Barry Bonds and the Making of an Anti @ - @ Hero.\n\nIt was in the year 2000 that the first real public interviews with Barry Bonds' agent came with public support from former U.S. Senators Barry Goldschmidt, Bob Kerrey and John Henry Weinberg. In 2004, Barry Bonds signed a four year contract extension before his first game. He received a multiyear extension in 2006 that was much less than he wanted. However, it is interesting to ponder the amount of baseball that has changed in the last two years, with more than one-third of the teams facing off between Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire, with a majority of the players in his locker room reporting to Bonds.\n\nPossibly more intriguing is the change in direction in the players' relationship with the public. In February 2004 Barry Bonds had the largest contract ever and led the league in base salary, with $55.5 million and the highest among major league players. But during the second half of 2005, he found himself alone with a man he thought was on a lifetime mission - to have a second chance with the country.\n\nAnd Barry Bonds broke up with someone he hadn't even asked him to give back. When he finally revealed he was working on a documentary about him and then revealed he had already had a divorce, he was the first baseball player to publicly say something negative about him. He had a few words in response to Barry Bonds that included a line, \"I don't owe you anything, I like you. And if we're going to make an art, it's going to have to be art by a bunch of people you don't know. So this is how we know we're worth a little more than you.\"\n\nEven after acknowledging that he could not be the first to say anything negative about a man whom he felt was on an unbreakable contract, Barry Bonds wasn't outspent by the public, and he even won the Silver Slugger, an award for baseball performance.\n\nIn any event, the way Bonds was treated by one of Major League Baseball's richest businessmen in 1991 gave the world a rare glimpse into what was going on in baseball in a world where nearly 80% of its profits were spent by people only marginally above the average age for a living living.\n\nThe following year we saw that same story of what really happened to the Bonds family. We saw the entire community and their families, and the American people. We saw Bonds not standing in the way of Barry Bonds and then running away from it all. And we saw that Barry Bonds has changed, to the best of our knowledge, only the furthest he ever can. He's changed in his time, and that's something that can only happen with someone like Barry Bonds, someone with a passion, someone committed to the club, someone who has committed to being the best man he can be. This is our journey from the old hero by the man who had no intention of making an art for anyone.","token_len":634,"entropy":[7.7673,4.8843,0.1722,5.7323,9.4711,0.3455,1.7954,5.2547,7.1377,1.5783,5.4149,0.7131,5.6299,5.1984,0.3462,9.1503,5.1608,7.2514,3.8642,1.813,4.5653,0.0268,8.8757,6.806,0.0741,1.6097,0.718,3.8343,0.0204,3.6227,5.2091,13.9492,7.5088,6.2665,9.4125,0.8122,2.1026,0.0612,3.9519,1.3019,3.6831,2.0651,5.2171,1.5156,0.6335,1.9469,4.1621,4.6716,4.3141,4.7483,1.2394,2.8145,0.6686,5.9306,3.8204,2.5828,4.0888,6.1786,4.0106,2.8181,3.6302,4.2928,0.0495,0.0085,0.0018,3.7209,2.8714,0.687,2.0926,0.0014,1.6233,3.5542,3.6359,0.0451,0.8773,3.5925,5.0928,6.8856,1.2692,0.3842,2.7728,3.9267,0.24,2.8713,1.6584,3.2305,0.6853,3.4678,2.2544,0.7808,1.1266,5.9857,3.103,3.8264,4.0351,2.9514,2.5075,4.438,1.2183,5.1344,2.0572,1.729,1.473,1.9498,2.7009,1.859,5.1234,2.5981,1.3373,3.2079,3.4894,0.9419,4.2413,0.0719,2.8476,2.4678,3.7737,0.2119,7.3349,1.7104,5.3566,0.0507,6.556,2.7123,2.74,3.4364,1.7445,0.5926,0.7721,2.5982,1.0558,2.3909,2.7146,3.7909,2.9938,3.0514,3.873,0.4878,0.2023,0.9294,3.6788,5.8605,4.1311,3.8391,4.1635,0.2323,0.2315,4.5289,0.191,0.0,2.2412,4.1508,3.1568,4.6627,0.2569,0.8327,2.7501,3.2538,4.5156,5.3726,0.3283,5.8487,1.381,3.9503,1.4151,0.631,0.0003,5.5326,3.5973,3.6102,4.4685,0.9458,0.6146,4.9645,0.2933,4.8672,2.9196,0.9342,4.6491,0.8551,2.1695,0.6221,1.3417,3.1106,0.4416,2.1154,4.6059,2.8778,4.2175,0.1795,4.2586,3.7532,5.7184,3.1306,2.0204,3.772,5.7456,0.4106,1.8991,0.1585,4.8958,1.674,2.2741,2.4013,1.4082,5.3793,1.2207,1.6117,0.0823,3.3285,3.3458,1.963,4.2127,3.4941,0.5414,0.8904,0.4695,4.3272,4.8202,0.9882,4.3224,0.349,0.0157,2.1036,0.7013,2.1375,5.9001,0.4293,6.1814,1.5409,2.2404,3.77,1.8754,3.1278,0.6736,5.0485,1.9669,5.243,5.3599,4.6434,2.3137,4.1187,1.4992,4.5031,1.9603,2.8239,1.316,5.4391,0.6719,1.0162,0.0002,4.9669,4.977,0.5089,5.6203,4.0598,0.5751,5.8458,1.2516,5.3656,0.0007,1.8542,5.4789,2.1368,0.1917,5.8574,3.1546,0.8979,4.6916,1.5427,2.8478,5.3514,3.3083,0.9707,5.5918,1.502,0.7891,3.4394,0.9096,2.0134,2.1708,5.4458,4.0374,1.2435,1.4688,4.5395,3.6981,1.2523,3.0123,0.8819,1.612,1.3657,4.4534,1.0556,4.821,0.2816,0.5275,1.4036,2.6233,3.4911,2.5226,0.2091,1.5944,0.5192,2.2962,2.9704,2.9402,4.3054,2.7636,3.7107,2.2484,0.4458,4.4959,0.3693,3.459,3.7608,2.7613,3.7002,3.3316,0.2308,1.3767,2.717,0.0009,5.2262,0.3961,0.6104,1.6711,1.4953,5.8792,0.3906,2.2039,3.7075,2.1656,4.6368,2.5077,0.9784,0.0413,3.6496,3.9337,4.1368,1.6542,2.9623,0.4585,1.1927,0.0036,2.2025,0.0337,0.3418,3.9749,5.2385,3.0765,6.0046,0.0151,1.952,4.9104,1.7407,0.0007,0.7944,1.9795,3.3506,4.7783,0.5488,3.1664,1.8335,5.3372,1.6136,0.6661,5.1489,3.5828,3.4102,1.8663,0.6158,1.2381,1.5714,0.3975,0.0002,5.282,2.8199,5.966,1.2781,0.6882,4.5511,1.0414,2.3411,2.336,2.9064,2.202,2.1855,2.8938,0.1431,0.1463,3.1552,1.8725,5.579,0.1191,3.2638,1.3802,2.4429,3.1073,4.3472,2.1249,0.0018,2.8348,0.3202,1.7907,0.1485,5.5743,0.0008,5.7937,6.6884,0.1399,0.7689,1.8748,1.8623,2.7825,2.0982,1.5993,4.8984,2.7118,0.9212,5.5049,0.0555,0.0129,3.6209,4.0743,0.6719,2.59,3.6051,3.3294,1.2495,1.2348,0.0002,2.4071,5.6002,1.1456,0.0409,1.8553,5.4121,2.5876,2.2772,1.5225,0.753,6.6643,0.4307,6.5823,0.001,0.0276,0.0475,4.8443,3.976,2.7753,5.5527,5.1019,2.4471,3.0817,0.7436,4.0733,0.3451,0.2722,2.4612,2.621,1.0467,0.0328,1.2997,2.257,2.6302,3.6121,3.1683,1.241,5.8783,4.5068,0.6823,0.0234,4.2946,6.5604,1.915,2.5611,1.5249,3.3991,5.5376,3.7243,1.6161,0.3554,2.5455,2.0401,4.6333,0.8841,5.0017,7.2492,0.535,0.8619,0.0002,2.6127,3.7936,0.7963,5.3596,3.1062,3.7034,3.8433,2.8363,3.376,3.4314,4.3495,0.358,1.4883,1.6417,5.2261,1.1307,1.0104,4.7545,1.4528,1.8224,5.6696,6.0623,4.0649,2.5401,3.1677,3.6343,1.9281,2.0784,5.9941,1.19,3.0048,1.5739,0.2874,3.275,5.0676,6.9209,2.2035,0.8325,0.6903,0.0442,6.1085,0.2239,3.1379,6.1359,5.3994,1.461,0.7364,1.9505,1.3898,0.8589,2.9695,1.0159,0.1991,3.1699,3.5238,0.1376,4.4229,3.7576,3.1676,5.2644,1.0114,5.0393,0.0171,0.8005,0.1474,0.1977,5.8929,2.8217,5.2165,0.0022,2.4485,4.1468,2.2195,0.9989,3.6902,2.0867,1.7688,3.3295,3.0808,5.057,1.5127,1.2837,2.8901,0.9194,2.4788,1.0392,3.2637,0.6954,2.4477,2.405,3.8119,2.1583,1.5168,0.0758,2.0967,3.8433,3.0358,1.4531,3.3055,2.6171,1.1182,6.8953,0.1673,1.8151,5.7442,1.5392,1.3179,0.5065,1.7758,5.5405,0.6121,3.4213,1.6268,0.6957,3.3843,1.2073,0.2143,0.076,0.4442,5.349,0.7491,5.3109,5.8314,4.0795,2.1303,4.8792,5.7258,7.0635,1.1659,3.084,0.8253,3.3502,3.0211,4.3551,0.13,3.9708,3.3869,1.1024,4.028,2.3688,2.4043]}
{"id":1911,"ended":true,"length":603,"gen_text":"One analyst described the size of the condom market as something that `` boggles the mind ``. Numerous small manufacturers, nonprofit groups, and government @ - @ run manufacturing plants exist around the U.S. in the hopes that those who use these products will be paid for using them. In short: for a period of time, the condom will be a big deal, not a small thing. As with birth control, though, these technologies are being developed and exploited so that they pay the cost.\n\nIt is a very good story here where companies are beginning to take these ideas seriously.\n\nA New Porn Story\n\n\nForget the fact that many people who use birth control are using them for medical or health reasons. There are millions who do. Not one of them will be taking any pills or pills containing sperm. As a result, many can't be trusted to stay home with kids or with anyone else without them, and it's really the parents, who are the most hurt by the change, that are most affected. And we now know that many have been so upset during the uproar about the decision by the FDA to allow men in the same category of insurance to receive hormones from women who already had a relationship with their partners.\n\nTo some extent, this trend is a product of the \"big one.\" And some, like The American Academy of Pediatrics, are saying now that birth control is the big \"big one.'' The Academy has issued an advisory on the possible effects of birth control on the brain, arguing that this should be a public health concern as well. Even more concerning is the fact that the Academy's report will only be published publicly because of the potential publicity that it will bring to the issue and also the fact that its final recommendation only lists \"the largest-ever study on contraceptives at U.S. health centers in the U.S.\" I am glad that The American Academy, where we were once a small part of the American research community, now represents a big part of what the future of our society will look like.\n\nThe decision was given by a group of medical scientists led by Dr. Maryanne Burdick, a clinical associate professor from Columbia University. She said the big \"big\" idea that birth control will cause men to use birth control has been around for years and was originally suggested by a new study led by Dr. Mark J. Hauschka and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2005. They now say birth control won't prevent men from using birth control if it's effective, but it is still an important new thought for this nation to pursue.\n\nIf you are concerned about your family, that's good, and if you can't care about your kids, that's bad. But if you know you can protect against a miscarriage or an STD epidemic that isn't covered under health care coverage, then it's going to be important for everyone to take this risk. This is the only way forward that no one - and particularly no man - should be left behind in the midst of something so horrific like this, but we can get there safely.","token_len":634,"entropy":[10.6973,5.3327,0.7853,7.7075,0.13,0.3884,11.9757,3.2666,0.3461,4.869,1.3472,11.0023,14.5043,1.385,0.1604,0.0563,5.4435,1.9243,9.1566,6.9485,2.8388,2.5746,9.7081,1.8214,0.6443,0.314,3.08,16.7215,7.1599,6.4721,10.2451,8.9672,2.9856,7.6896,3.297,0.0284,4.9445,0.0018,0.0073,0.3468,3.8832,1.9118,3.4856,1.4104,5.2032,1.6537,2.9619,3.2883,1.2284,0.5085,1.553,5.165,1.6458,2.5037,0.5501,0.5292,3.4434,5.0533,2.5219,5.7746,2.5686,6.0105,0.0813,0.0878,0.5867,2.1968,2.157,1.9166,1.2053,3.1356,4.0211,1.1774,2.4459,4.4938,2.8418,1.5668,1.5939,0.4082,4.1951,3.9063,7.1524,0.0049,0.5141,4.2006,0.0724,4.2376,5.4622,1.2124,3.5206,2.8198,2.3865,5.0533,5.039,0.8533,2.3476,6.3572,3.2039,3.2141,2.6296,2.5805,0.0551,4.0574,1.4529,2.9945,3.8831,3.0057,3.6383,4.7035,6.5674,5.1883,1.7999,4.8816,0.024,2.987,4.7024,3.4162,1.2468,0.543,2.88,0.0002,3.9967,4.4618,5.3218,5.1231,4.8272,0.0004,4.4496,4.522,1.3283,3.7479,0.0211,3.5012,2.2745,2.9841,1.1624,1.7504,0.0036,2.1201,3.265,1.6636,2.1181,4.0317,3.1689,4.873,0.099,0.4483,3.4765,0.8609,4.4174,3.2399,2.8359,3.0788,5.3924,2.7926,2.0279,0.5855,3.042,1.4996,5.0746,3.3393,3.2914,1.9266,2.5042,2.2817,4.507,1.5537,4.3627,1.7668,0.6409,0.1882,1.9926,5.7441,1.0674,3.7214,3.1964,0.4169,4.5969,3.6952,2.0361,3.9171,3.0914,3.6436,4.8313,1.9884,4.0713,3.9445,2.8298,1.3025,3.6022,1.274,4.5599,3.842,4.8742,2.801,2.7187,0.9696,1.5225,2.2415,6.1339,1.4082,1.5456,5.1986,0.9327,1.1936,0.8158,1.6473,2.2834,0.2632,3.8666,4.7583,5.4179,0.599,0.516,2.2793,4.2226,2.0718,5.4772,4.3308,7.1564,1.0275,5.0088,3.1268,1.1131,5.4535,2.3405,0.9781,1.1109,0.4224,2.3708,4.6151,3.8109,1.3728,5.5118,2.062,0.7735,5.982,1.164,4.6198,6.0227,3.2758,1.4011,1.658,4.2271,1.1928,2.9263,5.1776,0.3543,2.6608,1.3459,0.7911,1.1979,0.0002,5.1083,3.6564,0.8621,0.2175,1.702,5.9244,0.9854,2.4174,3.8297,0.0509,1.3594,4.3208,4.4976,5.1008,1.7033,4.0977,4.4932,4.2669,0.8095,5.4491,3.6558,1.9713,0.0411,0.2074,0.4067,1.9098,3.1273,6.8804,0.7356,4.5487,0.0122,0.7549,2.7039,2.4503,4.7866,1.7313,0.2214,1.74,2.9545,4.0184,2.3249,3.7381,2.2148,1.8516,2.5639,1.0302,6.0511,3.3836,0.2157,1.6695,0.0201,0.4994,2.1818,3.6409,1.3135,5.0459,0.1522,3.8839,3.8222,0.6009,2.3407,3.2155,0.0914,1.6136,4.462,0.3869,0.9552,5.8903,2.9755,4.0324,1.195,1.1448,0.5077,0.0195,2.0725,2.4425,2.3364,3.6784,5.5214,4.3298,1.5345,1.7964,4.6747,3.4783,1.651,0.8774,4.1043,4.6771,1.9515,1.9715,1.0369,1.7432,1.1835,0.8059,1.1565,3.5088,4.51,2.419,1.1958,0.017,4.526,5.7979,2.8879,5.0585,5.6705,2.9981,3.4249,5.6215,4.7726,0.3315,1.9145,2.228,5.5118,5.4303,5.8747,0.0092,0.015,0.0982,3.0115,0.7722,3.5656,1.3998,1.873,0.0005,0.0055,0.7782,5.3026,3.2173,4.7421,0.7732,2.2094,0.3109,0.2739,4.3898,5.1972,3.618,3.7929,3.5215,2.3103,3.5251,2.8386,0.2417,0.5001,3.8203,5.7078,0.1329,0.1331,2.5628,3.5312,2.0103,3.1039,0.6283,0.0404,2.8148,3.2368,3.8491,0.4424,2.6126,2.0906,1.6305,0.3387,0.0017,0.2645,0.576,0.0003,2.2723,5.566,3.8371,6.0921,0.8335,1.6497,2.7675,0.2146,3.9627,2.7792,3.3755,0.0093,0.7421,0.0431,4.9486,4.8364,4.6172,4.0953,0.8695,0.8593,1.4453,4.1803,2.8853,0.1779,5.8423,3.6169,0.2112,1.6901,1.6984,2.4148,2.1474,5.1653,3.2595,1.141,1.8282,3.8392,2.1145,2.0624,0.0045,2.944,1.9418,3.5202,0.3198,4.2888,1.0531,0.0056,3.5975,0.7594,2.5999,0.3821,2.575,1.7084,3.1499,5.2915,3.7108,0.4134,1.697,5.9483,1.6527,3.1283,0.007,1.2572,0.006,4.6101,4.3,0.3416,4.592,5.1416,2.328,1.1609,2.5664,3.4279,0.3673,0.6111,1.7711,0.0169,1.6619,0.0606,0.2646,0.0052,1.449,3.2727,0.1683,4.0432,4.9958,1.2177,4.9491,0.0023,4.7396,0.0009,3.0618,1.1326,0.1743,1.1526,0.5408,0.0049,2.913,1.2491,1.9032,3.7156,2.0887,1.0717,1.826,3.144,2.4982,3.4289,1.5036,5.6098,4.673,2.5622,4.8018,3.3396,4.2444,4.2768,0.301,0.5511,0.0002,4.989,1.3618,2.1358,3.3929,0.313,2.4701,4.0196,2.0771,4.5632,1.2773,4.0435,2.5934,2.9261,1.7912,0.1937,4.2458,0.621,4.4955,2.0313,0.4307,2.099,0.3296,0.7969,0.0443,1.4809,0.6969,1.5467,1.3328,0.1904,4.3416,1.7935,2.0905,5.4579,5.8021,3.1494,5.717,1.4761,3.3286,1.8731,7.2422,3.6493,4.7861,0.0006,3.8414,2.361,3.2079,0.8861,1.0797,0.4328,1.7709,2.596,0.5865,4.6493,0.0048,0.3351,3.0787,1.3705,4.9912,0.716,2.5717,2.451,4.0648,1.0339,3.7851,0.8464,2.2698,4.0383,1.0197,5.0121,2.391,6.0843,0.6181,5.9051,3.6081,4.271,2.3584,5.4305,0.4713,1.1264,1.0977,2.3981,1.0313,2.4783,1.2839,4.5524,0.0014,5.3159,1.4976,3.6974,4.3192,0.408,3.604,3.4304,2.4141,2.0775,4.4105,1.5218,6.908,0.6553]}
{"id":3587,"ended":true,"length":498,"gen_text":"Forests cover about 57 % of the Potlatch River watershed, while about 38 % is used for agriculture and ranching. 78 % of the land is privately owned while 14 % lie within the Wilderness Reserve System that are managed by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF). In 2003, the state also adopted a national strategy to keep threatened wildlife in the protected areas: \"This strategy includes using land owned and leased for recreational purposes to include habitat for all mammals and birds. The conservation goals will include a strong and permanent plan to control invasive species, habitat and other species.\", http:\/\/www.cdf.ca.gov\/species\/wildlife_protected.pdf (see also Forest Service Press Release on www.cdf.ca.gov\/wildlife\/wildlife_safeguards\/sustainable_wildlife_sustain_wildlife_sustainable_inland_wildlife_wildway.html )\n\n1. The CDSF's plan includes an 8,300-hectare (5,200 km) conservation perimeter between Oregon and Washington, with a goal of keeping 2 million wild species (around 2.5 million species for every acre) within the area of forest service. These wild species are: (1) Cervarium (an old-growth Cervarium); (2) Canoe (tactical mammals, such as whales); (3) Ornithopithecus, Ralephea, and Porcelain; (4) Pestilense eel (dolphin species as well); and (5) T. errae (eels, leeches, and sponges).\n\n2. The CDSF also has a 6,300-hectare (4,300 km) Conservation Area (CP) that preserves all threatened habitats in which wild populations of birds and mammals may be found, where habitat may be protected from damage by humans or other natural sources, and by the Oregon Parks Department. The CP encompasses a number of areas, including two protected areas, the East and West Caves for Redland Audubon (red bison, deer, lynx), one designated for bird migration habitat, and the South Fork (birdlife) forest (now known as the Forest Trails).\n\n3. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has authorized one CDSF conservation area for commercial and commercial farming.\n\n4. Crows and rabbits have been documented to live near large areas in Oregon.\n\n5. Crows and rabbits have been documented to live in wilderness areas throughout this nation.\n\n6. Ducks have been reported to live in remote areas in Oregon, and birds of prey, such as geese, gophers, deer, foxes, deer antlers and mountain lions, are among the many wild wildlife that can be found in Oregon.\n\n7. Ducks may also use their large size to sneak out to the forest, often to hide under a tree or in a tree cover, to kill in the wild by eating, watching and hunting, or by making noise for protection.","token_len":634,"entropy":[8.1823,7.1261,3.0132,6.9346,5.7455,0.0242,0.6013,12.1142,7.6925,0.0232,2.9588,3.6178,1.2792,3.9404,5.2457,5.3834,0.0841,1.9057,4.4166,0.6393,2.426,1.5233,9.2168,0.0381,0.3303,10.7,1.4509,0.1288,0.6815,3.2769,1.39,6.001,0.2461,4.8869,5.1732,0.0587,10.6709,1.4037,0.6924,5.7441,5.0854,1.992,5.4703,4.585,1.5331,0.4197,0.7336,4.7991,0.7244,0.0014,1.2735,0.96,1.2284,0.0816,1.4635,2.0279,0.1047,2.5714,3.7077,5.2994,0.3791,1.2248,3.0488,4.6515,4.1299,0.9464,4.2628,4.0884,0.6073,5.5509,4.9718,3.0833,2.8981,1.0383,3.7199,0.4556,5.4012,3.1181,4.6278,2.0505,2.6618,5.0633,3.8808,4.1527,3.2227,2.3148,2.0317,3.713,0.5899,2.0756,5.7737,3.4139,1.4278,3.7511,4.7863,1.2494,0.5709,2.0547,2.0664,3.9303,3.4812,4.3482,1.0763,3.2999,4.3704,2.9952,3.5132,4.645,0.617,4.3634,3.4406,0.2546,1.3169,4.0153,2.8194,3.4466,3.0806,11.2315,4.0333,0.0011,0.3065,0.0013,1.9046,0.3222,0.1857,0.2276,0.7689,0.1253,0.1124,4.9458,0.5598,2.2647,0.0723,2.9644,5.542,2.3027,3.357,3.3845,3.8002,1.9023,5.1839,1.9718,5.168,0.1934,3.1798,4.5436,0.0012,1.1655,0.0442,0.0271,0.0348,0.0026,0.0013,0.3602,1.936,0.0474,1.3126,1.4954,0.0774,0.6502,5.4645,0.8021,0.7562,0.8772,5.7229,0.9894,0.4725,1.4962,0.1558,0.4035,3.4383,1.2916,3.6029,2.3019,0.1133,0.404,1.7286,1.3675,0.4105,6.9825,2.7992,0.2924,1.7206,0.0993,0.3564,1.5417,7.9295,1.8387,1.7312,4.1711,1.5266,0.0316,5.2222,0.7811,2.8684,4.4235,5.196,2.971,2.5924,4.7927,2.3599,3.3886,5.145,2.582,3.8415,0.6928,4.7819,0.0086,0.0016,2.4586,3.6038,0.2843,2.7256,3.3995,1.0561,4.5989,6.0139,4.1553,5.7895,0.2333,2.0076,1.6074,2.3823,1.6471,4.3659,0.1658,2.9187,3.9565,1.8441,3.711,3.7642,2.8134,5.03,3.1118,1.5592,0.9312,0.1137,2.7343,4.0864,1.8309,2.5261,1.9454,1.7182,0.8596,2.9896,2.3826,4.5098,5.9417,1.8387,4.3751,3.2156,0.8268,1.3855,4.3998,3.9455,0.5104,0.0177,5.0112,3.4138,4.9539,2.6346,5.1617,5.7508,2.2316,0.4812,3.4343,0.1832,0.259,2.9155,0.128,0.0057,0.0025,5.4038,3.9508,1.5021,5.9327,3.7645,0.6389,3.9278,2.2483,2.0757,0.0008,4.1443,1.3046,0.2177,0.0016,0.003,5.6717,0.0492,1.8524,1.3333,0.1813,3.3678,6.0557,4.7437,5.024,4.8049,0.601,1.3578,5.7047,4.3356,0.6521,3.1321,0.2805,0.0021,0.0042,3.6977,4.1158,0.953,3.6821,7.215,2.0377,0.9482,5.3208,3.5748,3.1582,6.8967,0.675,1.6655,1.5672,0.0259,0.0011,0.0034,4.6678,2.8533,5.3983,4.5792,1.6182,1.1343,4.5414,1.5674,1.2065,5.2055,1.7731,0.2532,0.956,4.9278,0.9111,0.0619,0.3362,1.4178,0.0004,0.7973,0.0045,1.0249,1.6153,0.0861,0.0053,2.5132,2.7856,1.5999,5.2303,0.4166,2.7599,0.0527,0.0828,0.0008,0.0375,0.4886,2.0307,0.0132,2.4123,0.0056,0.0187,4.3313,1.5302,2.0035,3.9912,1.3893,2.1035,6.0463,3.8121,3.4879,5.23,2.4428,6.3893,2.0367,4.5687,1.1933,3.3547,1.1513,0.7253,3.0495,1.2898,0.3421,1.8867,6.0268,3.913,2.9145,0.3116,2.5387,2.6325,4.1914,1.157,3.8231,2.2728,1.1701,2.2825,3.9044,1.6527,0.7176,5.438,2.7317,5.2892,4.0559,2.5418,1.0453,1.4559,0.5814,2.7088,2.6714,3.3004,0.0026,2.5629,1.4979,0.3432,5.5233,3.0332,0.6348,1.5413,1.6955,5.9872,1.8817,0.3242,2.9233,2.2708,5.1554,5.6144,5.8142,5.7061,0.0036,0.0009,2.0835,5.4649,5.6466,0.8579,2.2284,3.6401,0.2085,4.129,0.0023,2.4227,4.7484,3.5402,2.5005,4.8347,3.3249,4.3663,0.9052,0.6137,1.8296,3.926,3.5571,5.0172,4.8789,4.9968,2.4027,4.8564,3.1472,4.9883,2.7629,0.0262,0.9777,4.825,5.4084,1.465,1.2136,0.0003,0.2555,0.0016,0.8507,3.4663,1.5403,0.0217,0.842,0.0644,0.1215,1.8517,4.6305,6.2561,3.8857,0.3556,0.0075,2.1507,0.7355,1.755,4.4153,2.3309,3.3916,6.0439,1.7335,2.5428,0.0003,0.2299,0.0017,3.4127,6.7077,2.0189,4.0914,2.4809,0.411,3.9061,2.2058,2.6205,3.4016,5.4102,3.1512,3.0842,2.1296,1.3728,1.244,0.0003,0.2447,0.0017,2.1819,1.9334,1.7075,0.1884,1.2935,0.3069,0.4779,0.2816,0.2795,1.261,5.3143,0.2847,4.3664,6.4783,4.9889,0.5011,0.3088,0.0003,0.2184,0.0021,5.8497,1.931,0.2374,2.7414,0.4818,0.4975,0.7336,4.465,0.8005,1.6194,1.2164,1.8948,2.2401,5.7712,3.2973,0.1471,3.6167,1.3413,0.001,5.4064,0.0233,0.3876,5.2983,0.8948,0.1091,4.343,0.1518,4.0492,0.0666,0.1414,4.7361,2.1287,1.4051,2.1889,4.9328,0.634,0.4282,1.5651,4.3288,0.3459,3.7022,3.3569,3.3728,1.6253,2.6125,0.23,0.7563,0.7371,2.1516,0.4103,0.4961,0.0002,0.1853,0.0028,2.2777,4.2132,2.4191,5.2878,2.624,3.7952,1.7562,0.6755,5.3429,2.8324,3.4719,2.5716,2.8425,2.0757,4.3415,2.58,3.8734,3.1464,3.3933,0.3283,0.9838,2.7544,1.5914,2.2119,3.0996,1.8051,2.3052,4.9731,6.0989,1.7775,2.2064,4.4214,4.0307,3.3525,5.2725,1.7571,3.2128,1.6968,1.4445,1.3692,4.9125,2.4003,4.8442,2.9287,0.5215]}
{"id":3911,"ended":true,"length":576,"gen_text":"The first general outline of the post @ - @ 1945 borders of Croatia was made by the Anti @ - @ Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia on 24 February 1945.\n\nIn October 1939, the Hungarian army captured the southern part of the Croatian border (east of Nava Rovanovo ). After an intense battle the Hungarian army lost a lot of time, as Croatian forces could not hold on to those positions for long. By 20 December, all Hungarian positions had been taken and the Croatian army was able to defend them, and at least 3,200 officers were arrested. In the following days, some 1,300 Polish officers and 11,600 SS officers were detained. After 3 years of detention on 9 May 1939, only 2,000 Polish officers and 2,000 SS officers were released. During the next 6 months a large number of officers and officers exchanged weapons with the Croatian SS officer who was also an officer of the anti-Nazi 'Gruzina' [Nazi party] and, as there is no record here about the capture, who tried to bribe some of the officers through his work in politics.. The rest of the officer corps went to the other side. As for some of the other Polish officials, they were not sent from the Krasin-Kazakhoslovakia, but instead sent by the Austrian Foreign Force which was working on the border.\n\nThe next general outline of the post @ - @ 1939 borders of Croatia was made by the Anti @ - @ Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia on 24 February 1945 as they had lost all three positions in the Hungarian Army. By December 1941, Hungarian and Croatian troops were under the control of Habsburgic, and only a small number of officers and officers remained after their release in this part of the border at the beginning of the war.\n\nLater, in 1941 I gave a briefing on the 'Gruzina', and in June 1943 we published the preliminary report of the occupation by the Croatian SS. The report was very interesting and told the exact facts of the occupation. These facts include the occupation of the southern Croatia, the Croatian border over which, in 1941, the Austrian army had control, the number of SS officers and officers, and the occupation of the north Croatia.\n\nThe actual 'Gruzina' was found lying just outside the border between Krasnik and Krajina and there are still a number of interesting details to cover over its existence now. The 'Slovenian SS' has decided to put the story, first published in August 1941, to the people of Macedonia to be used as the basis for the present work.\n\nThere was good reason behind this decision, however, and the most important reason was that the Albanians were not only defending their territory, but they also wanted to have the full control over it, and hence also their own people (if not for these reasons) are to blame. For the present, it is no surprise - and yet in a way no new events are in the near future to mark the end of the Balkan war in their homeland.","token_len":634,"entropy":[5.3423,7.6495,6.3587,0.4516,1.0638,6.5812,11.739,8.5283,4.8119,11.9157,9.9677,4.5754,8.2131,4.4328,2.8708,1.5584,1.9075,9.245,11.5377,2.0907,1.2757,5.5832,1.9937,6.5045,3.554,1.8392,5.7014,1.9001,0.2027,3.9009,3.7031,4.6241,3.1273,0.4679,0.6277,2.1735,0.0899,3.4625,5.1147,4.6877,0.9329,1.2863,5.8426,3.743,3.9338,1.3673,5.6125,1.2133,0.0069,1.2197,2.8499,1.6537,3.77,5.4306,0.276,4.9217,3.3519,5.5174,3.8474,3.5597,6.5881,3.8677,3.7733,2.9026,1.9969,3.0864,1.6598,1.3202,4.3049,3.001,3.59,0.0846,3.2738,2.2667,4.0653,5.5518,2.3238,4.6534,0.2728,3.6828,2.5064,0.78,5.9729,2.7505,2.4775,1.0055,0.5047,3.5497,4.4186,3.1473,1.3805,4.6067,3.137,3.1452,1.238,0.0672,1.8385,1.8403,1.3446,2.6075,1.3803,1.0035,3.0973,0.0108,4.0791,1.6926,3.6114,3.0508,3.9422,1.9557,4.5309,0.7413,4.1409,5.2229,1.4006,3.9245,0.8356,2.9598,2.1862,2.3194,1.2231,0.8846,4.5433,3.1418,0.0559,3.0468,4.919,0.6688,2.065,5.379,0.1486,3.7908,5.3853,0.6285,0.3643,3.2671,0.9426,3.864,5.5259,2.8741,0.7383,3.4372,5.0423,5.3026,2.6867,2.0048,0.2669,4.1031,2.7623,0.3309,1.2849,1.4927,0.2594,1.3953,2.0998,0.0008,1.0709,0.0872,0.0173,0.7439,0.9854,0.808,4.1128,0.5937,2.2768,4.5478,0.3487,4.3589,2.2408,0.4815,0.042,3.1799,1.7524,2.1733,6.0152,4.9242,1.3559,1.0801,1.7356,3.9847,5.4432,2.8324,1.1384,3.4423,3.8297,1.243,0.7928,0.1877,3.8604,0.2096,1.828,5.5419,4.2205,2.7106,1.4621,5.2578,1.3629,4.699,2.9589,2.5304,1.2483,2.6864,5.0237,2.9086,6.3056,2.4689,0.373,2.117,5.8,4.1627,1.2023,5.6435,2.864,5.3285,5.7516,0.0979,5.1735,5.1934,0.8733,0.4605,0.8235,5.5134,2.7907,5.1029,2.3791,6.2767,7.1465,2.3284,5.0918,0.5685,0.1757,4.8115,1.5571,4.9196,1.248,1.6572,4.4681,0.6475,2.5033,4.6787,3.2751,4.3751,0.6708,0.0856,2.4129,2.8537,6.3417,0.8949,1.0311,0.664,2.7726,4.3841,4.7539,0.8356,4.9703,2.6685,3.9048,2.7289,2.8597,2.0908,1.1752,5.5902,0.511,2.1986,0.9953,3.3292,3.1177,2.3639,0.576,3.6901,4.6447,7.4853,4.3524,1.4259,5.1541,2.2157,0.9052,2.491,1.5441,1.7637,0.0003,1.6795,3.681,1.6131,0.0609,0.3149,0.0865,0.0343,0.5806,0.1701,0.0703,3.558,0.0435,0.0147,0.0584,0.1547,0.0259,0.0107,0.0301,0.2167,0.1616,0.0069,0.0107,0.3758,0.0002,0.0088,0.0139,0.0019,0.0047,0.0004,0.0013,0.0103,0.0087,0.5102,0.0076,0.0018,9.2027,4.6874,2.1931,4.037,3.4734,6.2144,1.5456,1.5767,1.0793,4.3106,3.3069,0.9416,3.9635,4.3936,1.881,0.5143,4.6026,4.1739,0.6543,2.0108,1.4717,4.9877,1.5404,0.6182,0.0146,6.4304,2.065,0.0007,6.1147,4.5,2.6983,4.9364,2.3553,1.2204,0.8111,0.1755,1.912,1.0318,0.3137,2.7888,4.9858,3.6552,1.4556,3.1099,5.37,3.8325,0.0351,0.6799,1.4406,6.4672,1.2648,2.5707,0.0224,1.5848,0.7387,0.1886,1.4068,0.0002,5.7877,1.3702,1.7431,3.1008,7.351,4.8256,1.1298,4.7575,1.0858,0.5131,4.8697,2.7804,0.0451,0.0119,0.0409,3.0296,1.7618,3.0345,4.2266,2.7685,4.2469,2.8317,1.6635,5.2595,1.2493,1.0962,0.507,5.6795,3.1181,0.6749,2.1265,1.7368,1.5777,2.0037,2.0278,1.428,2.9662,2.716,1.6307,5.6783,1.7411,6.132,2.1297,1.0251,0.2644,1.339,1.2253,5.6743,1.1839,3.8229,1.1673,3.5262,0.3932,1.0838,3.6559,4.9525,1.5471,0.6871,4.4552,2.5512,6.3348,2.4662,4.4688,1.9028,3.5676,0.3749,1.2964,3.8294,2.6877,1.1085,3.3247,1.0624,1.3613,4.6698,0.0435,4.0252,0.1953,1.3034,0.3269,1.7322,1.2415,0.405,4.1097,0.1444,0.6803,5.263,3.7599,0.8742,1.1522,0.0002,1.5365,5.8565,4.6142,0.4465,0.0055,0.0028,0.0037,0.0815,1.5877,5.578,5.4807,4.4832,1.1999,0.7432,2.2618,2.4954,4.3474,0.3335,3.2285,0.2954,5.2784,0.4874,0.1224,3.3168,3.8054,2.4343,4.2733,3.036,0.9403,0.0126,4.9356,1.7518,2.6892,5.4275,6.0826,4.7334,2.4409,6.5177,0.4254,1.8375,2.6562,5.5499,3.4707,0.2986,1.7981,3.7884,0.3992,3.5673,5.132,0.3408,4.1136,2.0829,4.2446,5.8375,4.8697,2.0724,0.5618,4.3326,2.1341,0.3118,1.6781,1.2684,3.8675,1.5567,5.3209,4.6317,2.6878,4.1158,0.8252,2.9995,0.5373,0.4522,1.767,4.5561,4.9373,0.8048,1.3409,0.0002,4.5909,2.8449,6.5851,1.0774,3.5719,1.0623,0.2439,1.57,3.7942,0.9579,1.6963,1.9551,4.7035,0.3526,1.2088,0.8986,1.0126,1.1061,5.5605,1.6248,1.7911,2.0167,4.7526,5.3512,1.0343,2.0517,0.8685,0.3513,1.9868,2.3516,2.1473,0.3047,4.4964,2.1276,5.2902,2.0357,0.5905,1.9575,1.9875,1.5552,5.136,5.364,3.3127,1.5034,3.1713,4.5095,5.3003,2.4987,2.84,5.2011,1.6798,2.6128,5.0802,2.6827,2.9505,0.7758,4.2365,1.9762,5.1942,1.0395,2.5814,0.4873,5.2502,2.2976,8.1038,2.9969,5.5391,3.9338,3.3813,1.8839,4.5674,5.9904,4.5302,1.7661,4.6204,1.2273,4.6482,0.0143,1.3258,5.0443,0.543,1.9788,0.0319,0.4071,3.5966,0.0017,1.2294,3.3309,5.7128,2.9001,0.3732]}
{"id":2442,"ended":true,"length":589,"gen_text":"Prior to the season, the five freshman were dubbed the `` Fresh Five ``, a moniker hearkening remembrance of the incoming freshman class of 1991, known as the Fab Five, that had played three games in a row. The first group featured freshman defensive tackle Will Bouchard, junior cornerback Will Bouchard, quarterback Brandon Dixon and senior cornerback Mike Williams.\n\n\nIt was a big deal for the U.S. after graduation. According to the coaches before his arrival and when the program met, three freshmen were named finalists and he was selected No. 1 overall.\n\n\nWhen he became the new head coach after being drafted by the Miami Dolphins, Bouchard went to the Browns and he had nine tackles on top of seven tackles for loss, with four forced fumbles, which led to one interception and two fumble recoveries. The rest of the defense played poorly, giving up just three tackles with three sacks and three forced fumbles, while the offense ran away and led the league in total defense, with only an interception.\n\n\nThroughout his time at Miami, he got his fair share of criticism, and he found plenty of room in his coaching staff to make a statement. As he explained to the Tampa Bay Times, Bouchard believed he was \"being very responsible for the way he plays the game,\" but also did everything he thought he was supposed to do with the way he plays.\n\n\nThe \"Coach Riots\"\n\n\nThere was a lot of criticism about Bouchard's efforts to make Miami a national powerhouse. They could never get as competitive with the New England Patriots and even now, it feels a little less like a place that would make an appeal to that group.\n\n\nBut as the 2014 NFL Draft approaches, you're going to see a return of a lot of young offensive linemen who can run the football very well. They're not as sharp as they once were, but they still are playing well.\n\n\nThey're also getting better as a team over the next two seasons, while starting the season at center. So when you look at their numbers, you can see why people are excited about the potential of Bouchard to replace Mike Wallace at guard.\n\n\nOn defense, the Miami Dolphins signed a lot of top-level defensive players over the past two drafts, and some of those players are starting to show promise. That is certainly good news for Bouchard, who has a decent amount of experience at starting over someone who is supposed to be a more versatile option.\n\n\nFor the next few years, he will likely keep some of his high level linebackers in the position, but the best offensive tackle on his back will be on his back when he comes of age, and he could eventually have to learn to take a different mindset when he moves back to the right side of the line.\n\n\nHowever, it's not clear if Bouchard is the right type of defensive tackle to do this, and the team would have to make moves to get better at it. A new quarterback may be the priority, but he may very well have to work on that for years.","token_len":635,"entropy":[2.7671,1.6651,7.5351,1.0361,1.9555,7.339,7.906,4.1654,9.3437,0.9117,8.4152,13.3747,11.3155,6.8814,2.1664,2.7734,3.6444,4.4519,7.0956,0.0599,21.1524,0.1307,1.5349,10.0397,1.0763,0.523,1.8916,4.9733,2.011,7.3156,0.9085,0.337,9.0679,0.7173,2.5489,4.3509,2.9519,4.6099,4.6817,2.0938,1.111,1.5765,0.1331,1.7581,2.1109,3.3754,5.2052,4.6968,3.4588,3.9268,1.8452,5.2129,4.5154,4.6406,0.0395,0.6503,3.1458,2.9318,4.694,3.8391,0.2208,0.0055,0.5829,4.964,4.7548,5.5488,0.9518,2.389,2.7968,4.6054,3.8424,0.295,3.5075,0.0005,4.6318,0.4954,1.5171,4.2563,3.4086,0.9692,1.0363,5.0268,1.6479,0.0168,0.0699,4.6089,5.5458,1.9261,5.9327,0.0012,1.6093,5.3496,7.7087,4.1231,1.9075,4.9899,4.2766,2.573,3.3907,4.226,1.1949,5.394,2.15,1.7359,1.6259,4.0676,3.0126,5.8252,1.349,2.8548,3.8814,0.0024,1.0694,0.7038,0.8383,1.7936,0.0004,4.7011,1.7212,4.3978,1.4386,4.5641,1.1758,0.0491,5.0949,4.3431,3.235,1.2305,0.4354,3.7672,0.4585,1.2941,1.3017,0.004,0.001,4.1516,2.1057,1.9522,5.6722,1.521,4.6447,3.5708,5.7949,2.4494,4.0388,4.6826,0.0365,3.8419,0.5783,0.2976,0.075,1.6544,4.5605,2.5395,3.215,0.0034,0.0001,1.6201,5.7908,2.9797,0.4692,3.5291,1.4473,1.3216,1.9027,1.6222,0.0351,0.0074,0.2696,2.623,3.868,0.2951,0.4199,4.1631,3.6099,3.7306,1.1117,4.9362,0.1211,2.1235,2.3976,3.8769,5.4748,2.2991,1.7357,1.4168,2.1914,1.7711,0.0055,0.0006,2.2404,2.7038,1.188,1.6253,5.2351,5.1565,4.7556,4.687,1.5448,1.9256,0.4099,2.3302,0.4106,2.4786,2.2343,3.5096,5.5228,0.7988,1.3544,0.4418,0.0003,5.9489,0.5184,1.4811,1.1218,0.7949,0.0919,2.9184,5.5394,3.1317,3.37,0.0027,0.0022,1.0635,1.7494,2.8707,1.8801,5.6403,3.6503,0.5014,4.5396,2.5924,1.125,3.3476,0.2174,0.6731,2.6964,2.6007,3.3026,0.6442,4.2694,2.1649,3.7295,1.5255,1.5907,5.2403,0.0789,0.1618,0.9816,3.8668,0.0024,0.0011,6.0218,1.9414,1.2493,3.2461,4.6632,5.375,5.1638,1.4907,1.1102,3.0105,3.2362,2.4749,2.005,0.0366,2.4017,2.2066,3.951,5.1615,3.9993,0.8255,6.0758,1.2444,2.2159,0.5425,0.0007,0.5132,4.0485,1.0169,4.9251,0.2022,2.6543,2.146,0.5175,0.0004,2.9328,5.4166,4.3175,5.6422,4.804,0.3737,1.696,0.0004,4.7582,1.2342,1.305,2.3134,0.6237,2.587,2.1838,1.0249,0.0015,0.0021,0.647,5.3801,1.2714,3.1025,2.4549,1.0273,3.2053,1.8615,1.0565,5.4091,5.7495,4.8227,2.5169,6.6532,4.9427,2.905,0.8802,4.679,0.9677,0.001,2.0568,4.981,5.8478,0.8137,3.2807,4.2956,4.2851,0.2966,3.8533,1.1984,0.855,4.497,2.5764,3.6397,3.0818,3.4503,5.8067,0.6893,5.1951,2.692,0.6431,1.0684,0.0002,2.528,3.582,1.651,5.8788,2.629,0.6659,3.6463,0.1249,4.734,3.7827,1.0631,0.0045,0.8883,1.1016,6.077,1.4448,2.3248,0.7183,0.0839,3.2732,4.8073,0.8049,2.1756,3.8519,4.3713,1.5285,1.3875,6.5165,0.1315,0.7914,3.1557,1.5531,2.6951,3.1029,5.4932,0.8889,1.3626,1.5947,0.0492,0.6782,0.56,0.4735,2.5823,3.7005,5.4474,2.4991,0.6347,1.2618,0.0002,3.9758,1.2389,1.8654,2.4996,1.6254,2.4836,1.2311,1.0145,6.6735,0.1828,0.7978,1.6958,1.2865,1.0463,4.6229,5.0731,2.5828,1.3926,2.2992,4.5888,0.896,4.4622,3.973,1.6128,1.2267,0.1477,2.7929,2.8008,0.9271,1.7955,1.4486,0.5971,2.8343,5.0326,1.3273,3.1706,0.5597,1.9886,3.3608,1.1283,1.6223,0.0039,0.0018,2.8033,3.6884,3.5938,1.8764,2.4911,2.154,0.5385,0.7678,0.0002,4.2935,2.3037,0.0885,1.8157,4.0238,0.7278,5.6287,2.7668,3.7948,0.0109,3.6946,0.771,1.5538,2.6212,2.2519,3.4032,0.0638,1.0544,0.7281,3.3561,0.8798,1.9013,3.8019,0.4732,1.0928,0.8001,1.5144,2.2978,0.8147,2.2296,2.6196,0.5229,4.3681,3.1732,4.8231,2.8946,0.4324,0.274,1.7099,0.0018,0.002,0.6196,0.787,1.6582,2.7659,5.6978,2.8074,0.0169,0.7929,1.776,5.0865,5.878,5.5023,1.6699,1.7462,5.5281,0.0013,0.4182,0.9857,4.0899,3.8688,4.5678,0.8274,0.3684,0.0002,4.2215,1.3589,3.1523,1.1713,0.5552,0.0856,2.2672,1.0737,2.3261,5.4914,3.8868,0.3685,1.3092,5.3234,4.2135,4.9394,1.9905,1.0486,4.7309,0.8826,1.1084,2.7168,4.0561,4.9377,3.3322,2.2686,2.6847,5.1844,1.3908,1.0559,4.7916,2.1538,2.5076,3.5155,0.7649,2.6528,5.0277,0.0044,2.1079,0.9072,1.394,3.7182,5.1042,3.5236,2.1895,3.1268,1.3908,4.8425,2.2894,3.3645,6.2137,2.3983,1.178,4.3123,2.6407,0.7956,1.0863,5.1912,0.1697,0.9312,0.057,0.599,0.2331,0.4407,0.0003,5.2329,0.0357,2.5495,1.2883,1.8979,3.4432,2.1779,1.2429,0.0013,0.0021,1.8888,2.4842,1.2544,4.1498,0.145,2.1131,0.9466,0.9881,5.3635,2.8345,1.4087,1.3938,2.6042,3.47,4.1447,1.56,0.2861,1.975,4.466,0.7867,1.8044,3.6544,0.3894,1.7509,0.4919,4.395,4.1482,4.3766,3.3317,1.0177,2.3079,6.4866,0.7972,0.5526,2.7393,3.1371,5.6047,0.0044,1.9459,0.2774,4.1118,1.4156,3.5508,4.6758,2.5699,2.2641]}

The Anglo-Saxon rulers of these periods had their own kingdoms (England, France, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Somerset, Somerset, and England), including Edward VII of France; the Anglo-Saxons, including King Edward VII - and King Peter IV - in 1176.\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nFurther information [ edit ]","token_len":635,"entropy":[2.4913,7.6546,0.4565,1.1179,4.9478,0.4524,7.4543,9.4867,0.0158,8.218,0.481,9.4824,0.6593,7.0587,3.9587,5.5242,0.0464,1.4107,6.8351,2.3603,7.3563,0.1179,6.0166,1.0944,5.4278,3.6618,0.2342,2.1285,7.2607,4.8622,1.8437,0.3778,3.6167,2.11,4.7118,3.2825,4.3374,1.9585,7.5588,7.258,1.2946,4.4009,2.2766,2.4647,4.2651,3.5682,1.6744,5.7514,6.6145,3.9088,4.2535,3.0935,5.4313,0.7656,0.7507,4.3861,5.4378,4.3751,7.6643,0.2828,0.7399,4.8621,3.5844,3.9957,3.1209,0.2113,0.6507,2.6169,0.0031,0.4823,1.2497,0.0122,11.2063,6.5629,0.2592,0.0098,0.0007,0.02,0.0034,0.0475,0.0025,0.0086,0.0,6.7882,0.7989,0.0669,0.002,0.0066,0.0026,0.0001,0.0018,0.0165,0.0166,0.0018,0.0042,0.1395,0.0007,0.0005,0.0009,0.0008,0.0032,0.0005,0.0032,0.0006,0.001,0.0059,0.0088,0.0038,0.0026,0.0011,0.0011,7.0138,1.4802,4.6248,2.1527,4.6242,2.2335,4.796,0.1126,4.9421,4.559,1.767,3.1649,3.2858,3.0407,1.3445,5.6894,0.0702,1.5258,0.7439,3.5173,0.0273,0.2055,1.9873,4.7186,1.0124,1.4599,4.4134,0.6466,0.5817,1.6337,0.0002,6.937,0.7699,0.0144,0.0031,0.0019,0.0444,0.0003,0.0204,0.0038,0.0005,0.0004,0.0024,0.0008,0.0011,0.0034,0.0038,0.0194,0.0057,0.0006,6.0387,5.8225,1.2726,0.1252,3.5672,4.4509,0.3084,4.7451,3.1148,0.593,1.9471,3.9792,1.28,1.2579,4.8223,0.4376,1.9336,5.732,2.7532,4.0008,2.7609,4.4689,3.0735,5.4728,5.6015,4.8366,2.8024,4.1139,4.6297,0.7401,3.2719,4.1645,4.0846,4.52,1.33,4.2278,1.3613,0.0757,0.4157,0.7434,1.2012,0.7875,0.0002,9.8202,3.827,1.3419,5.1678,0.0447,0.1897,3.5965,5.7307,0.833,5.4675,2.4958,0.0434,5.4684,2.8395,5.3308,0.9951,5.5817,1.2887,4.2163,6.2815,1.2243,5.8744,0.0565,0.1831,1.5899,3.8978,2.0043,4.9827,4.1234,0.046,6.4333,2.061,1.9914,0.4723,0.0002,4.6527,3.4114,0.0269,0.0019,0.0073,0.0002,0.0147,0.0019,0.0018,1.466,4.3979,0.8978,5.1816,2.1601,2.7209,0.9028,4.2653,2.423,0.8286,2.4113,3.1694,3.783,6.141,2.8055,2.0704,0.488,2.276,5.5299,0.6205,0.7522,4.4129,1.9543,1.9995,3.9939,1.206,1.9481,2.5429,0.1594,0.4082,0.6868,2.2673,3.2165,4.4524,4.8252,5.5176,2.7851,1.1484,5.1213,0.1976,1.7289,0.7507,0.0002,2.1543,0.0251,8.8507,0.0035,0.0011,0.0006,0.003,0.0035,0.0005,0.0008,0.0044,0.0039,0.0047,0.0017,0.0032,0.026,0.2731,0.0003,0.0109,0.789,0.0257,0.0021,0.2089,0.0011,0.0002,0.0005,0.0009,0.0009,0.0015,0.0187,6.1189,2.7149,2.6075,3.6036,4.3796,1.1814,0.3967,5.6836,1.1574,0.2632,1.7921,1.7866,1.667,3.5189,0.684,2.6069,5.2042,3.8789,2.7232,1.9739,5.9058,1.0449,0.8633,0.0002,2.2127,0.0084,0.0009,0.0038,0.0012,0.0025,0.0021,0.0013,0.0003,0.001,0.0023,0.0005,3.9175,0.8929,2.3226,1.2362,1.0407,3.2016,0.4913,0.2312,0.7143,3.348,2.2169,1.9382,4.3146,4.8948,0.2698,3.5484,5.6873,2.4331,2.8948,3.4091,1.2202,0.3707,4.8995,2.2448,1.4329,0.8846,3.5481,4.4605,1.7216,1.8252,4.0319,1.3183,4.4678,3.1448,1.5576,2.5551,5.317,2.638,1.1485,2.6507,1.8783,0.0236,5.9465,3.3876,2.5873,3.5862,4.7396,0.4733,0.9215,6.0084,4.6283,0.6892,0.3,0.0002,4.0361,0.7001,0.8717,0.0067,0.0035,0.0025,3.1343,0.0158,0.0017,0.0043,0.0005,0.0009,0.0032,0.0074,5.4335,5.8799,1.0108,5.903,1.2741,4.6671,3.9013,0.33,2.3045,2.1401,4.0597,2.3732,4.4549,2.2496,2.7312,1.5309,2.1343,1.1507,1.484,1.9207,0.3105,1.8085,3.7628,0.7583,1.8594,0.8754,2.4009,1.3109,2.5591,0.0432,0.5907,0.0534,5.6596,1.5273,0.7451,0.4461,5.5842,0.0963,0.8779,1.8522,0.1489,1.6441,0.7594,3.0447,0.9477,5.5186,0.1332,0.229,7.0955,1.7086,0.5532,0.0002,5.6981,3.9853,5.9496,1.9496,1.1203,1.4942,4.9956,4.431,0.0173,0.1804,3.3607,5.9758,1.2537,1.1549,2.5959,4.0855,6.2029,1.829,2.426,2.5465,5.4017,3.5441,2.6019,0.4239,2.6536,1.8243,3.2751,4.1706,0.0139,2.3315,4.8341,2.9894,2.2807,4.9543,4.0011,1.4554,2.4413,5.6646,3.1384,0.7184,2.1477,0.6426,0.6517,0.0002,2.7864,6.101,0.9666,1.8989,0.8702,3.1734,4.8308,3.5304,0.2101,1.5405,4.0886,1.4018,0.0102,0.7212,4.744,0.628,3.4425,1.3622,3.9315,5.6004,2.6897,0.7887,0.0002,2.0257,3.5208,2.3615,5.5853,4.681,0.9167,2.3546,1.3449,1.6778,2.9303,4.5046,1.3345,2.8645,0.0507,0.3263,3.1704,4.5194,4.0073,0.7657,2.695,0.4784,1.6301,4.508,0.0904,0.0561,0.7582,4.4725,0.8202,4.7859,3.9785,3.1552,2.3961,0.8754,2.4011,3.1063,4.8219,0.7439,2.7712,0.1921,1.8433,0.4144,3.8902,0.0376,0.6444,6.4345,0.5042,3.9233,0.7818,1.4124,4.2335,1.617,5.0742,5.5146,3.3879,1.9984,4.1613,4.2777,1.7355,2.762,0.0109,0.0756,0.771,2.7854,3.4483,2.5085,2.6284,1.5922,8.095,3.89,2.2895,5.4975,2.7909,2.5588,3.6711,4.5616,4.1065,1.1009,0.9319,0.0003,5.4368,2.2437,0.0014,0.0024,1.1453,0.0004,2.6324,3.0838,0.0642,0.0003,0.0007]}
{"id":4543,"ended":false,"length":595,"gen_text":"Du Bois opposed the U.S. intervention in World War II, particularly in the Pacific, because he believed that China and Japan were emerging from the clutches of white imperialists. He felt that if military action were to occur against China, it would be only the first step to defeat them in the long term.\n\n\"The United States has provided 'wars' against China, a war of ideas against people whose main goal is the accumulation of power and wealth,\" Bois said and asserted the case for military action in World War II\n\nWhen war is mentioned at all, it is usually taken in the context of the world being attacked by other states. When it is mentioned in war literature, it is often used to justify a war against a country. In Vietnam, this used to mean: If China is attacked by the United States, then the Vietnamese government can be blamed for it. China is fighting for its sovereignty, territorial integrity, sovereignty and sovereignty over the entire world. It is fighting what China called its own people to defend territory. And it has taken on a massive role in fighting that nation for world domination.\n\nAfter World War II, China also faced numerous accusations of human rights violations and atrocities committed by the U.S. government against it. But it never went after its own people, the Vietnamese, because the Vietnamese did not want their lives threatened by a U.S. invasion or occupation.\n\nAfter World War II, the war continued, and despite calls for the return of Mao's revolution and a change in Chinese law to address abuses that had occurred in the region after the war.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, Mao died in 1949. During his final years after he died, Mao was the sole head of state on the Communist Party platform in 1949. He was an outspoken and outspoken communist, a clear indication that he was opposed to American military intervention in Vietnam. Although many in society believed Mao's death was a tragic event that led to American isolation, the fact was that Mao's death was a symbol for the rise and evolution of the communist party that he represents.\n\nWhen China declared war in the 1960's, their own government began supporting the Vietnam War. By the early 1990's, they had signed a peace agreement with the United States that included the repeal of the death penalty and the provision of basic freedoms. Their military action against Vietnam began to be backed by a range of American leaders, including the U.N., the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and Congress.\n\nWhen China officially recognized democracy, it did so in some unusual venues, notably this September's People's Liberation Army Front National Day Celebration where it celebrated freedom of speech and freedom of assembly,

{"id":1296,"ended":true,"length":596,"gen_text":"Following Alice in Chains'extensive 1993 world tour, Staley said the band `` just wanted to go into the studio for a few days with our acoustic guitars and see what happened ``and where our songs sounded in the way they were produced.''\n\nBut there was nowhere for Alice in Chains to go for a period of time.\n\nWhile the band's touring time began a couple of months into 1988, Staley said the original lineup was disbanded without notice before his arrival and release of the album.\n\nIn 1986 Alice in Chains had just completed its second European tour, leaving North America in the middle of its final year. The first band from the band was led by Paul McCartney, but he had never performed on a European tour since 1968.\n\nThe band's performance of Bob Dylan's \"We Shall Overcome\" drew a large following in Germany while another European group called the Beatles was formed with the help of several other Beatles members, including the singer, singer and guitarist.\n\nIn its third, final album, Staley and the band's live show, made some of the crowd-pleasing sound heard during live performances.\n\nStaley and the other band members met for some time. Staley told the Detroit Free Press in 1993 that he never went to concerts with Bob Dylan in mind, even after hearing some of the previous shows playing ( Staley, pictured, had performed with the Beatles during his '68 tour during the group's first European tour after his return from Europe on tour of 1970 ).\n\nIn 1989, Staley and the band performed with McCartney after three consecutive days of rehearsals. By the end of that session he had written five songs on the record using the Beatles, including a cover by singer Billy Joel.\n\nIn their live sets, the Beatles played an array of song arrangements, including the opening bars (\"I Want My Name\") and ending drums (\"It's Over You\"). All three songs featured Staley playing keyboards on acoustic guitars and a set included a \"Hallelujah\" (I am Love).\n\nA few weeks after this, Staley began spending nearly half an hour with Beatles drummer Paul McCartney, who he said had been impressed by his performance of Dylan's song \"Let's See You Go Through The Universe.\"\n\nThe album was originally called \"Let's See You Go The Way You Like.\" Instead of playing the record with the band and recording all seven Beatles' parts, Staley and the group embarked on a journey to create more than 30 new songs.\n\nIn the meantime, Staley kept writing some of new songs for this album, including an alternate guitar arrangement by Robert Plant -- one inspired by Paul McCartney -- that featured a song from \"You're Gonna Do Love\" by the

A student can easily relocate to Campinas for several nights \/ weeks, and can earn $100 for every single night with accommodations offered for a period of time. This semester will feature many student events including student-to-student events, community assemblies and activities, workshops, and student activities with faculty, staff, and administrators. Students will also be able to participate in the \"Sprint-Off Day\" with other Latin American clubs with the addition of a \"TU-Campinas\" club and a Student Community Outreach Club.\n\nSprint-Off Day also includes a program offered at the Student Center during the second half of the semester. Students will engage in a \"Student-to-Student Conversations Week\" on September 30, with students participating in the discussions and exchanging ideas (through an opportunity to attend a workshop where they might give feedback on some issues). The students will then share suggestions with the faculty and then will begin the student \"Project Conversations\" on the weekend of September 30. The discussion is then shared online and may be used for any discussion.\n\nIn addition as students, the Unicamp staff will work with the Faculty to support students traveling to and from participating in the \"Campinas\" program. The Unicamp Staff also works with the Campus Council on how to build relationships and support students in both an online and in-person capacity. Unicamp also assists in support of undergraduate and graduate students taking the first-ever Latin American student orientation.\n\nThese programs will focus on the needs of students, students. The goal will be to provide opportunities for students with limited academic options and limited resources, while also engaging students in networking, sharing ideas, and sharing their own perspectives. We look forward to seeing UC Berkeley continue to offer many new and innovative opportunities for students with limited resources and limited experience in Latin America, Latin America and Latin America: A Global Perspective.\n\nTo further promote the students' participation in Latin American cultural and academic activities, the school will offer a student-to-student group online to engage students through networking, presentations, and events. Students will be able to take a free \"Sprint-Off Day\" online and meet individuals.\n\nThe school is also preparing for the U.S.-based U.S. State Department's visit to Bolivia two weeks ago, for a delegation to discuss Latin America, Mexico and the U.S.-Latin America Region.\n\nContact:\n\nGregor Blume\n\nPresident, Unicamp\n\n+1 512-225-9077\n\ngreg.blume@tsunamisulp.com\n\nwww.unicamp.com","token_len":635,"entropy":[3.2976,4.1799,9.2661,7.2468,0.3918,11.0466,6.1862,4.1255,5.5778,8.3278,14.2607,8.635,6.0714,9.1872,3.8188,7.6045,4.2603,0.8229,6.0487,6.9363,1.7555,1.7389,5.355,2.6315,3.6658,7.1076,4.5187,1.8453,1.7735,0.5253,1.5861,10.0621,3.0018,0.8572,4.9364,3.5119,2.4871,4.8779,3.9307,0.8995,2.5908,0.0053,2.6884,4.8071,4.2778,6.804,2.3624,1.9595,1.7465,3.1026,4.8485,2.845,2.5914,2.9205,2.6819,4.3517,1.0989,4.9743,5.5324,6.4275,3.8085,2.7077,5.1602,0.1944,1.5287,0.3992,1.2346,0.0009,10.2604,2.7714,0.0154,0.0509,0.0508,0.0063,0.0066,0.1277,0.0581,0.0039,0.0016,0.027,0.004,0.0044,0.0032,0.0013,0.001,0.0012,0.001,0.0002,0.0017,0.003,0.0009,0.0006,0.007,0.0014,0.0021,11.261,0.002,0.0006,0.0011,0.0001,0.0171,0.0018,0.0011,0.0006,0.0004,0.0108,0.0036,0.0013,0.0011,0.0006,0.001,0.003,0.0011,0.0909,0.0042,0.0023,0.0081,0.0006,0.0043,0.0031,0.0099,0.0226,0.0009,0.0022,0.0002,0.0006,0.0007,0.001,5.0517,4.5617,4.1466,2.9073,4.1709,3.2499,3.3604,2.1644,4.3391,3.0021,3.794,0.001,1.1654,3.9029,0.5408,3.721,5.3755,2.0802,4.9576,1.151,3.9856,0.5213,1.4869,3.946,3.6818,3.7327,3.2131,1.0492,0.7548,0.4412,0.3878,4.3458,0.2885,3.1711,1.7445,1.3109,1.368,0.754,0.0102,1.9371,0.0588,2.3241,4.3365,4.9322,3.588,4.0205,4.9949,4.1224,0.4294,3.57,3.612,6.0598,0.5109,4.9894,5.5282,2.2568,4.2741,0.0039,1.5064,2.7416,4.8689,4.9905,1.8359,3.296,1.778,0.9196,3.3345,3.1585,1.7295,5.6183,4.6658,4.9108,0.0122,4.3626,0.5269,0.7028,0.0002,4.4747,0.0657,0.4981,0.0301,0.2091,5.0586,1.4312,1.2388,5.2554,6.5358,2.3403,1.2837,4.8844,2.05,5.9591,0.5995,5.1068,1.7075,0.0192,0.2857,0.3137,1.5236,2.0137,1.2013,5.8403,0.2187,1.804,2.482,4.0656,3.2921,0.9427,0.0017,0.0697,4.9386,0.1191,7.2944,0.3687,2.4661,3.7622,3.0133,1.8984,2.4304,3.6097,1.7553,0.2288,2.2684,4.2186,1.8162,5.4894,0.8346,5.2093,5.7683,4.3413,6.0113,0.4654,4.9606,1.5731,3.7744,5.5222,1.5483,4.6189,5.498,1.4976,1.4194,4.3955,2.8025,1.819,2.2809,3.905,0.7231,2.4007,3.4414,6.4461,2.6292,1.1333,2.4299,1.0198,6.6015,3.3744,3.9176,2.0862,4.3397,6.1007,4.9961,5.61,0.0704,0.4658,2.3166,3.0331,4.2302,0.8343,0.777,0.5287,1.4332,2.1403,5.6767,2.7891,3.0663,3.493,3.8717,1.7647,5.0413,1.4062,3.1868,1.8589,3.7619,3.5789,2.8351,0.9547,0.0002,3.6289,0.5786,8.3149,3.5977,2.8306,2.3528,2.7444,0.0594,2.4025,0.8618,2.9264,1.0636,1.4111,3.8931,1.6273,3.7975,2.0132,6.1882,0.77,2.0489,0.3274,5.6439,1.93,0.7839,2.8163,3.6067,0.1226,1.4602,1.2207,0.5022,1.7218,2.1534,0.0171,3.9002,2.8895,2.7307,0.3835,0.6322,3.1363,3.7355,2.1704,3.8253,0.341,5.4544,2.5726,2.3338,3.0793,1.922,2.0674,4.9669,5.6016,1.6272,0.2542,1.2858,1.1538,0.2105,2.0147,0.3548,3.6885,0.0149,1.8617,4.686,1.7986,5.3881,0.4746,5.5212,1.2719,0.0941,1.1241,5.447,1.9963,3.7651,3.4541,1.2764,3.2804,0.1425,4.7552,1.7355,2.2963,0.5327,0.0002,5.7862,2.8977,2.5391,4.6404,0.2398,2.1938,3.1668,0.2346,1.1188,2.0656,3.5313,6.3263,2.12,4.1926,2.5863,0.049,0.1554,1.8823,3.2897,0.2768,1.3915,3.5053,3.8708,3.9205,3.1418,1.7626,2.4864,2.3898,2.4619,2.8584,1.2296,5.115,2.0819,0.8265,5.752,1.735,4.311,1.5405,0.3421,0.3097,2.9347,3.2931,3.2367,3.0381,0.6937,4.1638,2.8007,0.0079,0.0029,1.8422,5.349,1.1589,3.3027,0.2491,4.3896,4.463,3.5989,1.9443,1.2231,2.406,0.6694,0.8904,3.5121,0.8912,1.9223,1.0931,0.4297,3.7242,2.1221,0.8228,1.6189,2.3736,3.5098,0.609,1.5509,1.8095,0.2757,5.1498,2.5792,2.176,1.1381,0.4591,0.3714,0.0003,4.0953,4.4423,4.1538,1.5532,5.1127,1.1181,3.1633,0.2838,1.6612,0.6587,4.9124,1.5051,2.325,2.6032,0.3075,1.3197,5.1256,1.3722,2.4504,1.2686,4.7091,1.1366,1.0927,0.0011,0.0547,4.1849,5.5022,2.9995,3.5738,1.8227,4.1591,2.8281,0.9742,5.8123,0.2133,0.6172,3.3682,0.5252,2.7534,0.6377,1.5332,1.3295,0.0085,4.3653,3.1268,3.831,3.027,3.5033,0.0019,0.1298,0.0413,0.3293,0.2049,2.908,2.0799,3.5505,6.278,5.3231,1.5211,0.0002,2.2665,3.6586,2.0311,1.1059,5.4139,1.2167,1.155,5.5142,0.2883,0.022,1.888,2.8839,3.7679,0.3642,0.0554,0.4466,4.3347,0.5297,0.6373,5.0458,0.5755,4.8488,7.0698,0.7108,1.5831,1.5289,5.5393,2.088,4.7692,1.6042,2.5893,1.7211,0.5581,2.0221,5.8651,1.6857,1.3653,1.49,0.0015,0.0059,0.5681,3.1106,1.2084,5.683,0.4001,1.0135,0.0002,4.9814,1.0077,0.8368,0.0002,5.4071,3.4209,5.8632,4.0753,1.0704,0.0004,4.0341,1.2602,1.0902,0.0818,0.9943,0.0002,2.6545,0.4846,5.2755,1.1471,5.3523,0.0129,3.0474,4.6212,2.7786,0.2472,0.0002,1.1357,1.6471,0.0284,0.0002,0.0166,6.3675,3.3402,1.8658,4.0472,10.5036,0.658,1.6634,0.5159,0.0002,4.1154,0.0008,1.3686,0.0178,0.2046,1.459]}
{"id":130,"ended":true,"length":605,"gen_text":"Clarkson has cited the color red as the album's only theme. A color traditionally associated with Christmas, she affiliated the color to various emotions in the holidays. Wanting to stray away from the typical holiday theme in her own songs she often uses blues and other bluesy colors because of the color. Many have chosen blues or light blue to represent 'wonder' or inspiration.\n\nThis could also hold true with those who prefer dark and dark blues or light cream colors. If this is so then all three color tones are based on darkness and light. If this is not so then all three colors represent warmth and warmness. The same applies with the use of bright colors. To this extent, I am aware there are a number of cultures who use both blues and light blue. Yet in my own work this has not come to any appreciative notice.\n\nIt has also been suggested that using some colors as inspiration is simply a way to use them together or to take a color off the album. As far as I can tell however it is the same principle that has been proven by many different folk traditions.\n\nFinally let us look at a slightly different example which I believe will become more clear in a second. The last song of the series is from 2004 (The Life That I Have). The singer, Chris Taylor, is known for his love for the color turntable. He may think these songs are a blend of his love of colors, love of music and he is very proud of his work of art. It makes perfect sense because he loves that the turntable has such an amazing reputation. What does this say for his popularity and popularity within the industry as an artist? Does it also give him insight as to the importance of his work on this particular album as well as his love for music?\n\nAlthough the turntable is a very famous turntable and could even be heard around the world, its popularity within music has been greatly underinvested in the past few years. In the past I have often been asked if it is good or bad for the consumer to choose an artist for a project. I would have gladly used turntable of any brand. It offers so much diversity of color tones. This brings me back to that time I heard 'Purple', as you can hear it in the video:\n\nIn any case, one cannot help but wonder what would happen with the music of a song like that where the artist would have to go to many factories to make the product. I'm sure there is certainly enough of an audience to help the creator make it for this album to be heard. I would then wonder what if one could try that with other artists and if there could be some merit to it. One would hope the creative process would bring out all of these different colors. Would it also have the appeal of a show where the music is so catchy and catchy that it can sell at the best price. This is the beauty of color music, and no matter how much a turntable may sell in the marketplace, it must be very appealing to use it in a special way.","token_len":636,"entropy":[8.4816,0.8777,4.2426,8.029,1.6963,10.3775,3.368,0.7607,2.2179,11.0333,0.119,4.5219,5.5903,1.9759,4.804,6.341,8.3983,0.9363,0.007,6.2415,1.2455,4.213,14.688,1.5255,3.124,4.4263,5.3056,8.8836,3.0007,1.0322,6.8707,1.305,10.8291,0.6155,0.2043,10.6184,1.632,0.014,1.1895,5.2474,2.3234,1.6833,4.2428,2.0946,3.6673,2.5127,5.5897,4.5174,3.0123,5.2426,1.5538,4.1047,0.5917,2.2231,2.1166,6.7641,1.4145,0.9409,2.6392,1.3861,6.0015,4.8043,5.0538,4.8034,3.174,4.5774,2.1752,1.9498,1.9537,7.5256,5.1997,1.4814,2.8835,1.8062,5.5858,0.8359,1.2242,0.0159,4.6525,5.8727,2.4494,6.775,0.5079,2.9876,5.8119,0.8471,4.0198,3.8622,3.222,3.5498,1.1531,2.8771,0.9421,6.5213,1.8088,0.928,4.4331,3.0719,0.9824,3.7507,1.4511,5.4919,5.5741,4.4208,3.3046,1.6919,5.5384,0.2672,6.1889,1.449,2.0147,0.813,3.4337,1.3012,0.3499,2.5284,0.4568,0.0762,1.9702,0.2202,1.2418,3.2513,5.9974,0.6692,5.938,0.2793,0.469,2.9403,4.1809,2.2504,2.6065,1.7441,5.1355,0.0052,3.365,1.7147,1.4956,5.2938,3.3777,3.1107,2.1191,4.9683,2.6086,4.1537,3.3899,0.5759,3.0009,1.0597,0.023,5.7779,1.7778,2.1029,4.4238,2.7595,0.075,0.3724,1.006,1.6877,5.8704,3.8988,1.5874,1.8954,3.5235,3.9638,1.9644,1.8491,4.3107,1.2687,3.5242,3.7992,1.9588,3.6097,0.355,1.0391,0.0003,4.0765,3.2848,1.535,0.4282,1.6918,0.2487,4.7868,5.3074,3.0428,2.1986,3.2408,2.2805,4.9671,1.6686,1.4324,0.894,5.0872,2.2681,6.1971,3.4729,1.5327,4.9699,2.0454,3.6553,3.3349,1.9302,1.2312,0.8559,4.265,4.0119,0.035,0.3093,1.4054,0.2888,6.5937,2.9913,0.7526,3.6863,2.9411,3.8294,1.659,1.7035,0.8993,5.1299,2.3568,2.0952,3.2796,4.3384,3.9421,0.7334,1.5191,0.0002,5.4533,5.5567,1.7435,1.5853,0.1064,2.9498,5.3294,0.5526,3.0608,3.779,1.7031,2.0813,3.4128,4.9037,1.0045,3.6639,1.6726,1.8421,2.6915,0.3368,2.7331,4.8796,1.818,2.2015,0.8799,4.9425,1.7924,4.4197,5.7225,5.2021,3.8501,5.5272,4.9106,2.6403,1.892,1.6377,2.1398,4.9823,2.7448,5.1164,4.9305,0.4789,1.7688,1.9464,0.5209,0.5569,3.1232,1.988,2.1346,3.1881,6.0505,1.0092,0.6215,0.7958,1.9453,5.7397,4.9411,5.5864,3.5912,0.5184,3.0897,5.9346,0.0702,2.8053,1.9912,0.9692,4.0779,2.1782,4.4674,0.2599,2.0549,0.5362,5.3285,2.4526,3.4606,2.8976,0.3144,2.3207,2.6985,5.1791,2.3405,0.3664,3.3237,5.1526,2.074,0.0019,3.9601,1.7442,2.7518,4.2438,3.2243,1.2627,0.0001,0.3878,2.377,3.4634,2.0596,2.7678,5.5272,1.072,5.0216,2.7582,1.0555,2.9315,3.1247,2.0814,5.545,2.1524,2.577,3.4623,0.6302,4.2201,1.9062,3.1147,0.1606,0.4165,4.4186,0.8984,2.9529,3.3963,0.6699,5.9855,3.2251,0.0394,2.3041,3.3645,0.0732,2.035,1.4101,4.1792,2.4653,3.6142,1.0763,3.2598,0.5615,1.0358,1.4949,3.2173,0.936,1.9775,0.8697,0.657,0.0002,5.574,2.4988,3.9447,0.0003,0.298,1.2841,2.0132,2.4169,4.4512,3.7019,0.0002,0.005,2.4622,5.8187,3.7999,0.4786,4.3784,4.0859,0.437,0.3151,1.1058,3.7411,1.4231,3.7359,2.809,1.8011,1.165,3.8292,4.1131,5.5995,0.129,1.4761,1.0384,0.8085,1.0647,0.0845,0.3662,2.9119,2.0827,0.9204,3.656,0.3631,3.5917,2.594,1.2657,2.056,2.9134,0.8381,4.6766,1.8803,0.115,0.8806,1.452,6.1774,0.7406,3.0641,3.792,2.5447,2.3452,1.7743,2.373,0.7349,2.0203,2.3705,3.2398,5.8294,5.6354,4.0253,0.0011,1.3774,4.5729,1.4771,4.5478,2.2081,2.8322,6.6611,4.1714,0.5341,5.3211,2.2991,2.5194,3.0138,2.2414,3.2498,5.1386,0.6161,1.9859,0.0293,4.3098,3.6487,2.8945,3.1605,4.7195,5.9844,0.041,4.5524,4.8479,4.8415,0.77,1.9292,1.9203,1.2783,0.9006,1.7726,6.2479,0.2395,0.0002,3.2284,3.5663,0.2166,0.8791,4.783,4.5508,2.5938,0.0664,1.8936,1.6658,2.8383,1.8819,3.5851,1.5384,4.0318,2.0723,3.5525,4.0907,1.3302,1.8372,5.4644,1.2109,3.1642,2.9515,2.1239,0.4999,3.4207,1.7887,5.3015,6.6011,0.868,1.8997,1.7596,2.7342,0.7224,2.6388,4.2998,0.7177,1.8917,2.1142,5.3697,6.0042,3.3921,2.4941,3.9907,2.5099,5.1476,3.2078,4.4387,2.6598,3.253,4.0412,3.9113,2.0673,4.4837,1.534,2.49,1.0259,2.5946,2.1833,4.9507,3.1836,1.3369,4.2819,4.2201,2.8138,5.228,5.402,2.26,3.0348,1.2961,2.7564,3.5259,2.1824,2.5755,0.1898,2.5746,4.1376,0.6261,1.7287,0.5996,5.03,2.4634,1.1586,3.0765,4.7583,2.1419,0.9585,4.4689,2.0413,4.1303,1.6713,2.5812,1.5566,2.017,1.7161,4.1713,1.4283,3.096,3.6838,2.1572,4.1725,0.4384,3.249,5.7737,2.6575,1.1299,2.9529,1.3209,3.3953,5.7983,0.9566,1.9977,0.9662,1.1504,2.9762,4.7637,4.4591,2.0561,4.1573,1.1202,3.3079,3.988,1.2532,2.5122,5.1815,0.127,4.9127,2.8846,2.8048,2.0593,5.9863,1.0186,0.8591,1.9716,4.3596,4.9241,0.0002,0.0032,2.4627,1.8813,3.9089,0.8069,1.4663,1.0379,0.9348,4.2359,1.3101,4.9873,3.3547,0.9463,5.9983,1.0692,1.9922,1.1443,4.7486,0.185,0.3843]}

{"id":3424,"ended":true,"length":597,"gen_text":"Humans have lived in the vicinity of Roxy Ann Peak for the past 8 @, @ 000 to 10 @, @ 000 years. The first inhabitants were semi @ - @ nomadic, and since the mid sixties have been using the Peak ( the day of the annual peak in June ) as their basecamp. Roxy Ann has provided for the long duration of time it took to come here but once people settled there, the original community was taken over and all other activity and gathering began to return. The peak itself is approximately 20,000 feet above sea level and can easily be reached by foot or boat. The peak has been designated as the first major cultural festival of the Roxy Ann Valley.\n\nIt would be interesting to see if the Peak would be accessible to anyone from a number of different cultures: we currently know that most people know the name of another Roxy Ann Indian living at Roxy Ann, though they have never lived there themselves. We don't know if the local people will speak to people there, so it would also be interesting to see if people speak some of the other Roxy Ann languages. It turns out there is a number of languages of the Roxy Ann Valley in Roxy Ann, such as English, Catalan and Arabic, but there isn't much communication between them.\n\nIn the near future, Roxy Ann will see a great change. While there will be more people working to preserve Roxy Ann, the Roxy Ann Valley will always have those who work there and that is exactly what we are here for. The people working here will always know who Roxy Ann is, and will always need to be reminded that they are working for Roxy Ann if necessary. They will need to learn more about Roxy Ann, so their job will probably be to find an alternative. One way they will learn about Roxy Ann is that there will be a \"Cave\" where people gather for a day or two to chat about the Roxy Ann history. They will take the history out of the Roxy Ann Valley and move it back up the hill to their camp, for a community meet and food. If you want, you can even set up an informal food meet and get some food ready for the summer months. This isn't what Roxy Ann Valley as you know it is. We're not there to just sit and eat at dinner and enjoy coffee with other people and talk about our history, we want to move it over to the better part of our society.\n\nWith this in mind, it is quite exciting to be hosting events like this for the people who are here to be part of it.

Pardons and their mothers: Bison in Australia, 1980\n\nT.C.A.W. Pardons and their mothers:\n\nGryllotalpa rifipus Pardons and their mother\n\nThe first species introduced onto this continent by bison was its mother, the Garter bison, about 250 kms from Lake Seville, Illinois on March 23, 1981.\n\nIt was introduced into Canada by a Spanish group, known as the Orkney groups, from Texas. Their arrival in the United States resulted in a decline in wild numbers that has since stabilized, with the extinction of over 12 million wild (wild) Bison in the United States alone.\n\nThese wild, bison are found throughout the American Plains regions of the United States, northern and southern Canada.\n\nBison populations that previously lived on U.S.-based prairie land are now reduced to only

{"id":3436,"ended":true,"length":599,"gen_text":"Despite efforts by broadcasters to educate viewers on TV Everywhere services and how to utilize them ( including Fox, who featured a promotional video with Jane Lynch as her Glee character Sue Sylvester, and NBC's The Office, where the studio introduced its first mobile show about the pilot episode), Sylvester is offered the opportunity to take a part in the new series that's being developed by a studio called The Creative Television Group.\n\n\"With this partnership, [the television group] and Sylvester see a unique opportunity to bring the Glee TV universe together,\" said Mike Tannenbaum, the group's CEO, in a statement. \"TV Everywhere has been a natural fit for this venture, with a vibrant community of community directors, creators, writers, and artists\u2014who are working alongside each other to build a brand on TV Everywhere. The partnership shows up especially good for Sylvester, who won this year's MTV Video Music Awards alongside John Legend for best female singer and executive producers.\"\n\nOf course, there's more.\n\nFor years, Sylvester directed some of the series' most popular female characters\u2014 including Elizabeth Banks in \"Supermodel,\" and Kristen Wiig in \"Star Wars.\" At first, she was coy about how she imagined her favorite character would portray her\u2014which was fine until one day, she received a call from the show's creator, Michael Lillard:\n\n\"You can't write characters who are the best, and I had always done that,\" she said of her role in \"Inception.\" \"And that's what inspired this series. And that's where I came in to come out, and tell my story, and the story that it comes from\u2014which is a world populated by people who deserve you to do their job and do their job with your head. I think that's the real heart of what makes TV great. If that's what is important to you, that's what makes this show great. So for this new series I'm going to tell it out loud, where this is, and with The Creative Television Group, this is an opportunity for me to bring people in the community that want to see how that world works to a larger audience, the big three TV networks of the world. This isn't just a program about the world you're living in. This is an opportunity to grow this community.\"\n\nShe added: \"I just think there are just a lot of ways we can improve our networks to better serve people\u2026and more importantly, to make the entire community feel good. This is a very strong message to say that people who are frustrated with the content on their cable or cable channel must try harder to stay on top of this thing, and to take our message down to the next level. We believe that this is a great way to do that.\"\n\nIn addition to supporting the television channel's ongoing relationship with The Creative Television Group, Sylvester also serves as a senior producer for FOX News, executive producer of the Fox Business Channel, and co-host of the \"The Late Show With James Corden\" hosted by Corden himself.","token_len":636,"entropy":[8.811,1.9642,8.6226,0.4763,6.5178,1.2979,1.5305,5.6214,10.054,6.5113,2.3727,2.8799,0.6466,5.4286,0.8775,5.6434,9.6703,7.6077,2.8712,4.5662,8.1442,1.9084,5.6899,0.3302,3.6362,9.4302,4.157,4.233,3.899,9.1196,1.73,2.0597,10.6576,8.4613,0.7065,0.0,2.4753,1.5711,3.8786,1.7111,2.468,3.1842,1.6381,3.1513,2.228,5.762,4.7773,2.6408,3.2565,6.2003,3.3239,4.6356,1.8647,6.1107,3.3283,0.8521,4.3481,0.0347,0.0006,2.9272,5.401,2.1768,1.0314,0.0585,3.9059,1.7105,4.5149,0.3177,1.1938,3.9335,1.8061,4.1863,3.3239,1.8306,1.7252,0.3025,3.9826,4.0119,0.8488,3.5488,4.4965,4.8074,0.7723,0.7318,0.7783,0.0002,1.6858,4.8584,2.7408,2.9521,0.4511,4.9659,1.9542,5.7454,4.6516,0.1434,4.4341,1.9054,0.0104,0.0005,6.0867,2.2249,4.2499,0.2357,0.2786,2.3986,2.1122,3.6668,0.0104,5.7729,3.3968,2.8611,1.4495,1.1301,5.0206,5.3734,2.9234,0.1236,0.0558,0.0421,2.7545,3.9245,0.0475,2.7221,1.8414,0.3195,0.121,0.2589,0.1996,0.1251,5.5102,0.0683,2.4141,1.6221,1.1655,4.9478,0.422,0.1934,2.5638,5.4662,1.1242,2.9178,2.63,5.2054,1.5165,0.3127,5.0058,5.5239,1.2289,3.1205,0.419,3.0759,0.4835,0.5269,2.7611,6.062,3.6553,1.7968,3.2618,3.7618,2.241,0.0059,0.7227,3.331,0.8879,3.0842,5.0262,2.4648,0.2904,1.5229,2.2493,2.5353,5.0708,4.7507,5.4407,3.0713,0.7574,3.419,0.0016,0.0009,1.0453,0.4629,5.901,4.6564,1.3102,0.0282,4.9015,1.2229,0.0258,0.2024,5.3782,5.2606,1.642,2.1889,2.1707,4.233,5.2199,2.2426,4.8889,3.3095,1.4839,0.0648,0.0002,5.3486,0.183,0.0886,2.8608,0.6509,2.3363,1.8997,2.0529,0.0001,4.2903,4.0513,0.213,0.9912,0.0011,0.0005,6.3746,4.9889,0.2144,0.4423,3.4655,1.0358,0.9358,2.4515,4.8171,0.5104,2.2414,2.8531,5.9484,1.3508,3.6683,2.7562,5.6097,2.5205,0.8051,2.5041,5.052,0.9854,0.0,0.1013,0.1341,4.8371,0.9257,2.156,4.882,3.7433,0.3178,1.5991,1.475,5.2216,0.153,2.8679,1.1382,5.5217,1.57,4.8644,1.6262,1.1352,3.6315,1.233,3.3698,4.2023,2.3362,4.1975,2.3977,2.9762,0.4755,0.876,1.1348,4.5512,0.575,1.1084,0.1834,2.6032,2.4284,0.0869,2.2709,0.6214,3.3786,4.578,4.3284,4.2108,1.2118,0.0001,0.4415,3.1357,3.7939,1.2907,4.662,5.4864,2.1766,1.0267,4.0717,3.2922,2.6455,2.1718,1.8776,4.5101,5.4693,5.3652,0.3917,1.307,1.7174,0.7226,4.8416,1.0532,2.6693,1.4151,1.0451,6.5285,1.7102,0.2894,0.2455,2.8592,3.0908,0.7962,1.5942,4.942,3.1049,2.9454,0.6995,2.6146,2.4481,0.3329,3.6166,1.2291,2.7156,0.7891,3.3838,4.4614,3.9494,2.8696,0.7614,4.3211,2.3675,0.1852,2.0778,0.5824,3.7974,2.2967,1.4584,3.631,5.521,0.7763,3.2316,3.7241,0.5018,2.4236,4.7148,5.3072,0.1868,1.7416,0.3889,6.2658,6.3071,0.6971,3.5348,4.093,1.8601,1.982,2.5774,1.2048,0.5432,4.149,3.6109,4.6581,2.2539,2.18,2.5322,1.137,0.4768,2.2145,4.5659,3.3371,0.1667,2.0336,1.9099,1.9388,2.0401,1.0822,4.4235,3.9976,0.654,1.0382,5.3282,1.936,0.6889,0.1919,0.2948,2.5053,0.1389,0.4676,1.0412,3.7489,0.7138,0.8873,1.0954,2.752,4.1404,3.1665,3.9011,0.7009,3.4661,1.3526,1.3372,0.0189,1.7463,1.8622,6.0893,0.1108,1.035,5.717,4.9775,1.4209,2.921,0.7123,4.6144,4.8393,0.1863,0.0193,0.001,0.889,4.2821,0.3588,4.1045,0.2771,1.0131,1.1344,0.1552,3.2907,3.2217,3.1255,3.4261,2.5489,2.559,4.735,0.1564,2.0211,3.9423,3.3896,2.9334,0.5789,3.031,2.9455,4.9274,0.2489,1.8801,4.4987,5.6098,5.223,4.1614,0.334,4.8578,1.0542,0.7079,1.2596,3.6639,4.3357,0.0003,0.9285,1.2608,5.4837,1.3193,2.5269,3.0375,4.6547,1.4025,1.5067,0.0692,1.1762,0.5741,0.0355,2.0483,0.1272,0.8053,5.9112,2.7718,0.958,2.4564,0.0788,0.0002,4.7764,2.223,1.269,0.3166,1.3003,4.3932,2.399,3.5007,1.8877,5.6002,2.276,0.4659,0.0693,3.6459,3.313,0.2482,4.4638,2.6969,4.3369,3.7982,3.9759,1.3245,2.405,6.1063,2.4021,5.004,0.3608,0.2954,1.6684,2.1097,2.5022,5.7407,2.7752,1.989,2.6662,3.0898,3.489,0.4845,1.5366,3.274,5.0543,4.2782,2.1472,3.3776,1.6125,3.3933,2.3616,1.6818,4.6027,1.1888,1.3899,5.0203,2.3331,1.6221,3.4538,1.5683,4.6446,4.4527,5.2757,5.297,3.4155,0.7445,4.0319,1.0332,0.835,0.247,3.7103,5.0893,1.8279,1.2844,2.5048,4.01,5.8256,1.8861,5.7869,2.0686,0.8924,1.7738,0.0232,1.4518,2.7941,4.0008,0.6341,2.556,0.5921,1.3129,2.057,1.3299,0.3004,1.964,0.2458,0.7414,0.1529,0.0002,3.2792,1.817,0.1333,5.1093,1.0319,5.5266,4.6781,1.2949,4.1435,5.6867,0.0331,2.0652,0.0405,0.0166,0.0013,0.1367,0.6246,0.0052,0.0004,1.5792,2.7721,0.1754,1.4732,3.2907,1.894,1.6395,4.8213,3.3231,1.5253,5.9796,0.1356,0.669,1.3888,3.2768,1.9669,1.8183,0.953,0.601,2.6719,0.0472,1.2421,0.1355,1.0207,2.4031,2.2104,4.1663,0.2118,1.1998,3.1556,0.0033,0.0,1.1562,5.9992,0.0497,2.6157,0.106,2.4358,0.2072]}
{"id":1965,"ended":true,"length":548,"gen_text":"When the World Rugby Rankings were introduced in October 2003, Wales were ranked 8th. They rose to 7th in June 2004, before falling back to 8th in November that year. Following the World Cup in Argentina in 2009, they were ranked 18th.\n\nBut Wales' struggles have improved in recent years as the country added 15 players in 2013-14. Of the 14 new players, 14 have been on the move.\n\nWales Rugby Rankings\n\nWales and the WPA team\n\nThe World Rugby Rankings\n\nAwarding Welsh rugby is seen as a prestigious position in the game internationally, with winning the WPA award from Rugby Wales in 1988.\n\nWales have also recently added a number of players to their squad, with Kieran Foran, Jamie Roberts and Liam Tuipula currently among the most recent players to be chosen to the group.\n\nOne of the new members is scrum-half John Craghill, who joins the WPA from Leeds on Friday, and is one of seven players who have been offered a call-up during the World Rugby Six Nations in Australia. Craghill is the longest-serving of the three.\n\nAnother new member, Andrew Davies, is the only player from Wales (born in South Africa) already being asked to sign a free transfer package, which was presented to the international rugby community in January 2014.\n\nWales will also be eligible to receive the international football and football awards.\n\nWales Rugby Rankings for 2015-16\n\nWales' position\n\nThe Rugby Wales ranks are based on the World Rugby Rankings and Rugby Football Rankings, and based on the final team ranking (where available - Wales, Australia and New Zealand).\n\nThe rankings are based on the overall ranking of the players on each team, a score of 0-100, which is used to determine how many players qualify for Wales in any given year.\n\nThe World Rugby Rankings were introduced in October 2003 by coach Mick Hoon, who was elected coach for England in 2013 with the addition of six new players, alongside England's Sam Burgess.\n\nIn 2012-13, it was announced that six players had joined Wales, the latest of which is Shaun O'Driscoll (who was also chosen in 2011).\n\nThe full group ranks can be viewed below.\n\nThe World Rugby Rankings have now been revised and the final team ranks have been updated for England and Wales.\n\nWales now have over seven international players. As a result, the list of players below is now the full list of international players in the Rugby World Rankings - and then the second top 10 in the world rankings after the World Cup of 2004, to present our list of the seven best international players.\n\nNew Players\n\nNew players were added by Wales last week as news of the announcement emerged of the new \"Girard-type\" players.\n\nThe latest edition of Wales' new captain list will start in January 2015. This list will be revised in the following months, as part of a wider overhaul of the group for Australia.","token_len":636,"entropy":[2.5591,7.3578,6.6722,5.5519,1.4556,4.6127,0.8143,4.4436,4.8055,0.156,5.3663,1.5452,1.2823,5.5049,0.0529,2.6051,3.4228,6.6548,0.6203,3.3341,0.0054,0.8737,6.3556,1.4645,1.2987,3.825,1.0152,2.1742,0.5195,2.3514,0.0033,0.5089,2.5181,6.2274,0.0573,0.2389,5.088,0.905,2.4371,0.7962,2.0958,4.3393,0.9079,4.4336,0.2074,2.0417,1.1824,1.1252,4.3232,0.003,1.4987,0.9558,0.0017,5.2257,2.9591,3.0053,5.9038,2.7178,5.3508,2.2102,0.1261,0.1164,2.8014,1.7304,3.069,6.2324,5.1751,1.5361,1.4574,2.8246,2.3569,0.0343,1.0938,5.5989,1.3448,3.4194,2.9895,0.3099,1.2057,4.1275,1.2824,1.2043,3.944,1.1121,4.2639,2.5213,1.1841,0.0003,3.1174,0.0129,4.2868,4.3243,1.9648,0.0003,2.3982,0.0339,5.3284,2.035,5.0493,4.7264,6.0395,2.4562,0.0002,2.1651,2.9041,0.3365,0.1781,5.2345,0.0002,4.6263,5.0489,2.4084,5.1242,1.6748,3.1535,4.9586,0.1945,0.756,4.8254,3.0145,1.6303,0.8867,1.3809,6.1005,1.4035,1.4704,5.9483,1.3425,3.5238,0.3712,2.8811,4.6709,4.3175,3.3575,1.4514,5.394,0.9186,1.0352,0.0002,2.1857,0.1754,2.2934,2.7028,6.054,3.4149,1.9702,1.1846,0.0055,1.6282,0.8506,0.6574,1.772,1.195,1.8793,5.3083,0.0336,1.7594,0.0252,1.2335,4.6932,1.1607,0.815,4.1766,5.5145,2.308,3.7205,5.0833,2.6658,0.8362,3.0744,2.8719,2.7405,0.9043,1.4423,4.0161,2.7136,2.1309,5.7258,0.6228,0.1923,0.0002,5.7122,0.553,0.3385,3.0333,3.0269,1.5712,5.8065,0.0346,1.2032,0.0035,4.4433,5.8634,6.7059,2.3741,0.536,0.2863,4.2428,1.2235,2.7737,0.0458,2.9036,5.5598,3.259,3.7438,2.7239,2.3907,1.8809,3.2628,0.0329,3.431,0.8885,2.833,0.9125,1.1507,4.8356,0.8318,3.8166,0.1074,0.0013,6.3934,0.3391,2.3886,0.4729,4.0444,0.0012,3.7734,3.8738,0.8835,3.9871,0.0004,0.0019,1.7394,1.9452,4.9852,0.6876,0.2083,5.2171,0.3387,3.2899,1.9226,0.1408,0.0002,3.9687,1.3929,1.1131,1.671,5.798,3.6302,0.1874,1.4341,2.6836,2.2023,1.3918,2.4,0.7828,5.8271,3.6136,0.7877,3.7617,0.7914,0.3232,6.2307,4.2598,5.5781,0.1191,4.0436,0.771,4.873,0.7175,6.0192,2.7238,2.0845,2.8323,5.1885,0.3912,1.3009,4.1356,1.5414,3.0735,1.2564,3.0837,2.7107,0.2356,0.5846,0.0002,2.3577,0.1201,3.5738,2.2016,1.3482,4.5088,0.4888,3.3097,2.0578,5.3309,5.4857,3.4967,1.9147,3.6005,3.307,0.696,0.0002,2.1699,0.1121,1.3229,1.1731,4.6628,3.1697,0.7229,0.012,0.2885,0.0002,1.3268,0.019,3.0876,4.6542,2.6005,0.0002,1.8783,4.1737,1.0638,4.8677,1.615,0.3455,0.0593,1.1744,3.3802,0.1828,0.5263,2.1366,5.1086,2.3353,2.1337,1.423,2.3609,5.0188,0.0427,1.2262,5.4335,4.9318,4.0739,4.0026,5.1011,3.7403,6.1104,3.428,2.5114,3.0102,2.2207,0.7352,0.0013,1.4634,0.6404,0.0002,1.361,2.3928,0.5488,1.0278,0.0424,1.132,4.5047,3.0274,0.6889,0.8414,2.7508,2.7127,2.3777,0.6445,1.3621,5.298,5.389,1.1946,1.5904,0.8517,2.4048,1.1981,3.0068,0.9839,2.7175,0.4064,1.8069,3.3329,2.5377,1.3721,3.5121,0.3989,4.3775,3.4689,4.2281,0.7248,0.6718,0.2498,0.4287,0.0002,1.2974,2.7941,0.0635,0.2923,3.8538,0.3156,0.1494,0.3853,0.0334,5.4392,5.9423,4.8554,2.9287,1.9168,1.7803,0.8313,2.3219,3.5795,4.7946,4.0276,4.1071,0.9118,4.191,5.5081,1.1695,5.2052,0.0011,4.7497,0.8325,0.3241,2.6564,5.3277,4.7688,0.9532,5.2493,2.0908,2.0905,0.346,0.0001,2.5589,3.1979,1.0097,0.0014,0.2759,4.8408,0.2007,1.4224,0.2713,4.9584,1.5192,1.8503,2.269,2.3725,1.8289,4.5124,3.5126,1.1729,0.1126,2.1284,5.3828,3.8673,0.1213,2.362,0.0001,0.0005,2.9241,3.419,1.8154,3.1722,3.8516,2.0734,3.3966,1.4653,0.3759,0.0002,1.734,4.798,5.4255,5.8723,3.0821,0.0268,1.278,2.1128,0.6263,0.3381,0.0002,2.6444,1.7213,0.0333,0.1518,3.7162,3.4538,0.148,3.1937,2.4867,2.6222,3.242,1.5033,2.6866,1.3486,0.2274,1.4977,2.9995,3.5761,1.4339,0.379,0.6716,0.3977,0.0002,2.1745,0.0245,6.5187,1.4067,5.4593,4.5247,3.0578,0.8028,2.8896,5.9654,1.7879,0.1967,0.3422,1.6009,4.6134,0.5265,1.2632,5.5422,1.3168,1.422,4.3549,2.7655,1.0647,0.1953,2.6811,0.3507,3.0382,0.8723,2.6494,1.7492,0.1599,4.6764,3.2813,5.9031,1.1894,5.8266,5.1669,2.271,2.1427,0.661,2.5343,1.9564,4.4212,1.2499,1.3508,0.3882,4.0025,3.2618,2.6456,4.4058,6.1991,5.112,3.7663,0.3743,1.3527,5.2561,1.6364,1.5393,0.7298,1.6812,0.2211,0.0002,4.7905,3.4224,0.7708,0.0002,3.3258,0.8817,2.985,0.6524,4.5078,2.9868,3.2073,1.9934,2.5207,7.037,0.8476,1.1031,4.5327,3.1049,2.6672,1.2537,2.8024,5.9534,5.0401,5.0077,1.9154,3.9601,4.6317,0.2651,2.0911,1.4672,0.554,0.0001,2.1496,4.5411,5.5683,0.2202,3.2844,0.6934,3.9863,5.3381,2.6704,3.4468,5.2045,2.1471,2.2,2.4706,1.2286,4.1493,1.6143,1.2279,1.2867,4.4529,2.6194,1.3465,2.9576,1.2233,1.5052,1.9442,4.6543,0.0014,1.9,2.0199,3.9513,0.2462,0.2382,4.0009,4.2177,6.9585,1.4434]}
{"id":756,"ended":false,"length":557,"gen_text":"In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, several campaigners and writers characterised Tintin in the Congo as racist due to its portrayal of the Congolese as infantile and stupid. According to Tom Tintin, in the Congo \"a black man, who can be born to his own white man and make up for his white wife and children has the privilege of being in the same family as a black child but is also unable to understand the world.\" According to Tom Tintin, and thus the book.\n\nIt is reported that Tintin's mother, Marietta-Couture Likas-D'Ambrosou, knew from her stepfather who was also a Congolese child trafficker but had turned him away as he was a child traveller. She said: \"The one white man we were with was a negro. One can be a child traveller and come into love with this little black man. But if he says to me 'do it and never run away', he won't talk to me. I know we have to stop him.\" [2][3]\n\nTintin's writings, published in French in the 1930s and '40s, are notable for the fact that he described the Congolese civil war (1966-2006) in South Africa where the latter supported the former's war of independence which was fought on the frontlines by former president Nelson Mandela. However, despite his reputation as a war critic, Tintin is very critical of both President Robert Mugabe (who in 1994 was accused of \"genocide\") and the South African apartheid government. Tintin wrote many articles published by the UN-registered Voice of Nations (Votr) including \"An Honest Government: The Congo Campaign on Power and Government Reform in the Congo\" and \"L'Afrique de C\u00f4te d'Ivoire: A Congolese National Strategy: A Critical Review. The South African government's attitude toward the Congolese government was characterized by \"a double standard in terms of the nature of its dealings with African states,\" [4] while \"this double standard makes it difficult for any independent member state to continue to challenge the power of its political and economic leaders.\" [5]\n\nIt was with this kind of self-examination, Tintin found himself at one with former President Nelson Mandela and he became active in the conflict in the 1970s, where he wrote on the subject of the apartheid government. His essays became influential both on the right and left. Tintin is critical of, and criticizes, some of the policies of this nation's government, including the use of military force against the Democratic People's Republic of Congo and the role played by the United States and French colonialists in the civil war. He calls for African leaders to hold talks with the South African government regarding \"all means of addressing the ongoing crisis.\" [6] Tintin also states that he did not join the UN, despite being one of the founding members of a French Revolutionary Socialist Republic.\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]","token_len":636,"entropy":[2.6222,4.7182,3.9915,0.1225,2.9582,0.0152,0.127,0.0036,0.35,0.2316,6.0516,11.5966,2.8423,3.4903,8.9836,0.0401,8.267,4.9221,0.1639,5.0662,1.65,10.1498,0.2263,6.8197,7.8138,0.0268,2.4464,6.4285,0.0558,2.1241,5.1037,0.0015,0.0,1.719,7.7663,0.3718,1.2218,5.4363,0.37,5.5158,0.0013,7.7638,4.5345,0.2334,0.019,0.4391,3.0727,1.5343,3.4123,3.0933,4.0021,3.6631,0.7849,3.088,2.8904,4.1881,2.5427,5.1871,2.7296,4.0919,2.6362,2.3115,4.4331,2.3784,5.3785,3.3031,2.1694,0.9291,3.1319,3.998,2.5182,1.1513,6.2045,2.3695,4.067,0.2254,1.0584,4.1109,1.2093,2.3623,2.0335,0.5314,1.5436,1.2003,3.8974,6.1627,2.2314,2.4732,5.3766,0.0711,4.3924,1.1536,3.7703,2.9582,4.7919,0.002,2.6537,0.2738,0.0009,0.0011,0.244,5.9516,5.5785,2.9321,5.2064,5.6057,0.9927,0.0119,4.2822,0.9496,5.0884,0.2754,1.1813,0.0014,0.001,1.7854,3.9676,1.3218,5.4988,3.8237,0.1213,5.3072,4.4206,5.3876,2.897,5.3517,5.3384,4.6515,3.1972,3.0878,4.257,3.716,1.1706,7.2498,0.7118,5.9844,4.7558,2.0249,5.4741,0.6087,4.2557,1.3482,3.4299,0.8505,2.9048,0.001,0.003,5.342,3.7453,0.0746,4.7539,2.8962,5.5727,1.6751,2.3161,3.4519,1.8968,0.7657,2.5949,1.7422,6.0387,0.7779,2.7725,3.5417,1.9685,0.2835,3.2451,5.3692,5.463,0.5905,4.6391,2.7775,2.5904,1.5196,1.3713,5.7108,1.7772,5.1775,5.5916,2.9903,1.8799,2.2989,0.1579,1.471,5.0185,2.9889,6.8437,0.1921,3.9174,4.8269,1.9502,0.7494,1.2574,2.6954,2.8654,1.0593,4.8246,2.0329,1.1105,1.4516,4.9726,2.9881,4.1787,4.555,5.5254,0.4415,1.0877,2.3407,4.0478,0.0018,5.0245,0.6083,0.1757,1.01,1.9277,3.2744,4.6035,2.3433,1.7794,3.5237,2.2189,2.0457,5.124,3.3399,4.9832,0.1414,0.1129,0.5087,0.0001,1.9084,0.027,0.0011,1.242,5.0267,2.945,3.2705,0.6088,4.7255,1.6238,1.4045,3.1358,0.026,0.9745,2.1971,0.0543,0.0008,0.3053,2.3658,5.136,0.208,2.427,1.7529,0.0946,0.9073,4.8809,1.37,2.7548,0.0041,0.0031,6.4032,0.0664,4.3773,4.3173,0.4311,5.5189,0.221,2.4483,6.0645,0.3388,6.5545,1.9514,5.2956,5.7986,1.0522,1.4442,3.2593,2.9638,3.2219,0.2779,4.9199,1.6359,2.7814,1.9653,0.883,3.9859,1.2416,2.8151,5.3339,4.4124,3.6268,0.0113,0.7467,4.0889,0.1935,4.3622,1.6867,5.0059,0.8546,0.4946,5.191,3.3629,0.4805,0.545,0.0012,0.0014,3.243,4.6205,2.3242,0.0283,2.3227,5.7768,3.9634,0.0191,0.0001,2.7549,2.1524,3.9231,3.5123,2.4144,3.1229,0.1191,3.3835,5.0083,0.2092,1.2623,0.0387,1.6951,3.8905,0.0352,3.5169,1.1246,1.4547,1.9136,0.0021,0.0023,2.4286,4.8555,1.8649,4.8514,1.8671,1.0347,5.0668,3.8188,5.7609,5.4562,0.435,4.8042,1.9762,1.0795,3.7294,3.2468,1.4195,4.9705,2.5768,5.2435,5.3782,5.627,1.881,1.6298,2.6528,4.3669,5.0416,5.7959,0.9539,4.6544,4.7216,1.9504,1.2248,1.6746,1.5608,1.2512,0.5191,4.6913,1.9523,2.8416,0.4437,1.8633,4.1904,2.3845,0.0422,0.1265,0.0032,0.2886,0.0357,0.0008,0.7057,2.9238,4.0741,0.0069,0.0131,4.5451,3.2942,3.8077,1.9826,5.3221,2.158,4.7948,2.6746,4.7845,0.144,2.4779,2.2944,4.9397,1.9828,0.6951,2.3289,0.0021,0.0103,3.0053,2.3026,5.4895,0.4345,4.5433,2.4036,5.5918,0.4622,3.162,4.2294,0.0014,1.9549,5.0564,0.1879,1.8637,5.1054,0.2144,2.5873,2.5296,3.2926,3.1165,0.0855,0.3002,3.3502,1.6781,4.9304,0.808,0.2203,5.745,0.8691,1.3487,0.8898,3.8484,4.0208,5.921,1.4542,0.2531,4.9034,1.235,5.0763,0.7274,4.1131,0.4376,2.1542,3.9626,2.4468,0.6989,2.0191,1.0964,0.5767,0.112,0.064,0.5374,0.0001,4.9871,1.4004,5.0753,0.9309,4.1608,0.0009,5.7755,0.0568,5.2077,3.101,2.4223,0.0016,0.0021,4.4209,1.1751,3.1621,4.2913,1.8492,4.5205,1.3364,2.9799,0.0084,1.9582,5.6336,2.9408,5.2492,0.1856,1.0968,5.3488,1.9591,1.3849,3.925,0.0221,2.1973,3.5017,0.4438,2.2202,4.6263,1.2159,2.5223,0.7902,1.4282,4.2991,0.8618,2.0115,3.896,4.9213,4.7737,2.9475,4.9589,2.8461,0.9516,3.8919,0.259,0.9927,2.3328,2.6025,0.004,0.0031,3.4825,5.6919,0.0273,6.1905,0.8834,3.0755,1.6108,0.6345,5.059,0.4908,0.2247,2.5698,0.8054,6.1253,6.2105,0.6525,2.6691,1.2684,1.547,0.8861,3.9963,0.0033,3.1367,0.2457,1.3843,0.9615,4.2066,1.6692,0.0061,0.0317,0.0663,1.4231,2.6724,0.819,5.2688,2.0275,0.0211,0.7898,2.5051,1.116,1.6972,6.3454,2.1391,2.5651,0.6051,1.01,3.9216,0.0384,0.5445,1.6699,4.299,0.5534,5.3989,2.0915,0.3021,4.929,3.8549,0.5281,0.884,3.1669,0.0646,0.2737,3.2949,3.1164,4.9904,5.615,0.737,4.4766,0.5142,5.4943,1.977,2.4872,1.3621,0.0729,0.0449,2.2924,0.0039,0.0038,1.4976,5.1553,0.3967,2.6339,4.1599,0.0883,5.6381,0.5824,3.5911,3.7975,3.5623,1.8611,3.403,0.0235,0.3986,3.0292,0.2775,0.2093,4.5872,4.5739,5.2005,3.2712,4.5403,1.5598,1.3122,0.0001,5.1637,0.999,0.0124,0.0024,0.6571,0.0002,2.6985,0.1494,0.0008,0.0005]}
{"id":4531,"ended":true,"length":577,"gen_text":"In addition to writing editorials, Du Bois continued to produce scholarly work at Atlanta University. In 1909, after five years of effort, he published a biography of abolitionist John Brown.\n\nDu Bois' career began in 1889 and continued into the 1920s, when he completed his studies in sociology and American History at Atlanta University.\n\nThe Atlanta Historical Association, founded in 1890, organized a group of community-minded scholars to study race history of Georgia before it was incorporated into the state.\n\nHe attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill at the age of 12, and became a Professor of Civil Engineering. His research focused on the use of hydraulic fracturing in Georgia.\n\nDu Bois was instrumental in finding a safe area for the state's oil wells, which were being drilled to meet demand by industrial development. He traveled more than 80 miles to the coast in 1891 trying to find the right location. In 1896 he published his first work, The Civilian Conservation of Georgia. As part of his research, he created the Georgia Highway Patrol who assigned Du Bois his first task: stopping oil and gas production, the creation of a law enforcement and civil works department.\n\nDu Bois, like other civil servants, was not paid when he got to work. He began his political activism by working for various political candidates: The War Department (1926), the War Savings Federation (1928), and the Republican State Senate (1931). As an 1894 census officer, Du Bois served at the forefront in fighting against the abolition of slavery as well as the New Deal. In the wake of the abolition legislation passed at the end of the Civil War, he sought to make America stronger, and as a result, the Civil War was ended and civil rights laws repealed by President McKinley at U.S. Capitol in July, 1865.\n\nDu Bois's work is credited with developing an international understanding of slavery. In 1907, under the direction of the leading abolitionist, H.W. P. Putnam, Du Bois published his first book, The History of Slavery in America. Pledging to help restore the civil rights laws of the States and to help create the slave classes in South Carolina, Putnam wrote The Slave War (1914) as part of his 1864 census report: A Letter to Congress and the Presidency of the United States by Dr. Pledging to a Man, that had been to him an important and historic document of the time. Pledging followed in the tradition of Thomas Jefferson's 1865 \"Letter to the American Community\" and in the wake of the ratification of the U.S. Constitution, that document was replaced by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution's Equal Rights Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (16 U.S.C.A. Section 2303). \"It is the duty, therefore, of the government to protect and strengthen the civil rights of all persons, and particularly of black men and women,\" the amendment reads. This is one of the few major accomplishments in the history of slavery.","token_len":636,"entropy":[7.6823,0.9728,6.752,7.932,0.025,1.0423,8.9326,3.9869,0.0025,8.2055,0.3803,4.3693,8.0054,2.4246,4.6236,10.6884,4.0468,2.0691,2.2179,6.8596,0.4468,4.6509,5.6375,0.278,1.1173,8.713,0.3091,0.8058,3.0571,1.6581,4.5544,0.1843,9.399,0.1556,2.8458,3.7984,1.6324,2.2928,0.001,1.6687,0.0032,0.0005,3.1768,3.8406,2.0579,0.6644,5.2716,3.1026,1.4563,2.4056,0.9137,1.3774,0.0234,1.2574,0.855,0.1398,4.709,0.8097,2.8542,1.4629,3.8872,1.3327,5.1014,3.6692,0.6372,4.8657,0.329,0.2353,1.9986,0.0002,3.4599,5.4885,3.6312,2.8539,2.4199,2.5578,0.2404,3.3265,0.3222,4.5426,1.2516,3.3947,0.2229,4.613,3.6093,2.2862,1.8794,0.9291,2.0418,5.5692,7.0874,5.0706,2.5686,6.0994,2.1086,0.6415,1.927,0.4132,0.067,1.0334,1.2836,1.6216,0.0002,4.6953,4.5507,0.8558,0.6765,0.0301,3.1207,0.0898,0.4889,0.2737,0.0,4.8169,0.4208,0.9197,0.0063,3.9014,1.13,1.8882,4.1512,0.8126,5.7071,0.269,2.9699,3.6904,2.5509,3.277,2.7068,2.9043,0.1104,0.9318,4.8589,0.0469,5.0251,0.6849,1.8771,1.3128,1.6427,0.9212,0.0001,1.377,0.004,0.001,1.6007,4.4919,0.0211,5.6115,1.5519,5.6997,5.9439,0.649,1.6166,4.7216,0.677,2.6253,2.5349,1.6216,2.0037,1.5408,2.7673,0.8178,3.056,4.1685,2.4305,4.5056,5.6344,4.3517,0.5159,1.5628,5.5806,5.817,0.1465,4.3291,0.2231,0.9308,2.2929,5.3462,2.4843,2.7084,2.505,7.1466,0.0321,1.0194,1.9907,2.8348,1.5898,1.3868,3.1913,3.9125,1.6569,3.1085,1.5404,0.7135,3.4961,1.3657,2.1162,3.576,2.6651,4.6366,0.7713,0.9838,1.2274,6.1058,2.3579,0.0007,0.9988,1.3967,0.4037,0.7051,4.6575,1.0995,2.2442,5.1921,1.6593,5.8722,5.3218,1.8615,0.0116,0.0007,4.6435,0.9326,1.8484,1.8162,4.0226,2.1527,1.2351,0.0663,3.2018,4.1938,3.9258,5.7365,0.0363,1.0555,4.5768,2.0656,3.4626,3.6899,4.3543,0.888,1.6647,0.4403,0.0001,1.0972,0.0022,0.0015,4.088,3.0577,1.9783,2.335,2.2732,0.8048,1.6412,3.8302,5.0422,6.0098,0.3425,4.7108,1.9344,1.386,0.8073,1.2687,5.111,1.7021,4.0798,4.7299,2.4443,3.6343,1.4378,6.23,1.6056,2.6443,5.7363,4.7317,4.5261,5.1401,3.5724,0.9456,4.2308,1.5368,0.9356,3.2236,5.4357,6.5483,0.1353,0.0589,1.9028,0.1538,1.3128,0.2695,4.4319,3.9055,4.6548,0.6134,0.1107,2.3166,0.4079,4.6198,3.1057,5.0301,3.6846,4.9896,4.1693,0.4277,1.1265,0.0009,0.0032,2.6491,4.9992,0.886,4.5784,3.8899,3.4118,3.4053,0.8796,5.2543,1.4316,0.063,5.6411,1.6991,0.0112,1.8171,5.8849,0.1099,0.7191,2.662,2.7577,5.6087,0.001,0.4829,4.8923,6.4086,2.4383,4.7386,0.2188,1.2504,0.0006,0.3533,0.5526,0.0121,0.1677,1.4322,5.6214,0.7432,3.7435,5.3868,3.816,2.5416,1.3899,4.4154,0.9999,0.7751,1.2915,2.6283,1.7453,0.6558,1.8308,3.064,3.5618,4.4208,0.4174,3.5156,2.6334,4.2214,2.6359,4.6731,0.0041,5.4869,8.0753,0.0137,0.0243,0.0029,0.3773,1.1404,3.5207,0.9614,2.2864,0.0643,0.4166,0.0002,1.1994,0.0018,0.002,3.6884,2.2483,4.1778,2.8115,0.2443,4.6753,3.5237,4.2019,2.5924,0.043,2.0435,1.7836,1.7561,4.8313,0.403,6.4777,0.6063,1.8601,0.0015,2.5494,5.5074,2.3557,0.0518,1.3874,5.5179,0.0722,2.9632,0.0049,3.933,0.9424,4.4116,0.0082,0.0829,0.9782,0.0012,0.0048,1.716,1.8921,0.8322,0.9883,0.4526,0.8218,4.6022,0.0764,1.9267,0.0011,1.3635,1.4188,0.8644,3.7655,2.6158,0.3,0.4467,4.4486,4.723,1.0692,2.9037,0.0972,1.8229,1.0277,0.4839,4.6429,2.6188,1.5578,3.0558,4.1934,2.4351,5.611,6.7084,1.7109,3.7149,0.3238,0.2915,2.2131,0.0031,2.9839,3.4059,3.1845,3.5446,3.4455,0.356,3.3247,1.5282,4.1891,2.6665,0.0007,1.1713,5.0148,4.9903,5.0564,2.3005,5.7472,4.0794,5.9138,0.6278,3.8358,2.7373,1.4848,5.1373,1.2425,0.2045,0.2673,0.0027,4.0479,3.5629,0.013,2.2809,1.8089,0.8784,0.6181,4.3842,5.2247,2.5349,4.7711,5.2531,0.6357,5.34,2.8508,4.1617,2.5555,3.2943,5.3617,1.5944,1.7913,0.8672,4.2185,0.2341,2.6463,0.0047,0.0102,4.8513,2.1676,1.3546,5.5196,0.1602,3.8344,0.3853,3.0125,5.6424,3.595,1.4945,0.7098,0.4586,4.2629,6.8377,1.2039,1.2064,3.7689,1.2581,3.4877,0.0019,0.4119,5.6167,0.0691,0.0811,3.2729,0.0013,0.005,0.0027,0.0312,1.3341,5.1154,1.6345,1.2402,5.1788,0.3527,0.5493,5.2616,0.0092,0.1082,2.0851,0.0184,1.0529,3.4683,1.2044,1.8499,0.0006,0.0414,0.8051,0.0336,0.6436,2.4256,3.0274,3.6048,0.9189,2.8205,0.0197,0.4175,0.0002,0.0316,3.6385,3.9645,1.1347,0.0009,0.0031,0.0015,0.003,0.0071,2.2179,0.1762,1.6486,5.0287,3.3285,0.5784,6.361,2.9622,0.7762,2.4908,0.9366,4.2448,2.5188,0.0403,0.1445,1.1766,3.3643,0.5903,2.3391,1.52,4.2721,0.4826,2.3605,0.5841,0.3264,1.1852,1.9335,0.904,1.5888,4.6175,0.5877,5.7765,1.5337,1.3971,0.0927,1.4588,1.7706,3.3325,1.7793,0.2592,5.7093,2.8735,4.2074,0.3071,0.2511,3.0712,4.3518,3.8823,2.2536,0.9448,0.5526,0.0138,1.2834,1.1887]}

Although some 330 @, @ 000 troops were lost in the ensuing war ( ). The Romanian armed forces ( the Romanian Army ) were unable to liberate Bulgaria from Bulgaria for a period of almost 15 years.\n- Bulgarian troops have lost about 12 000 of their own.

In 2008 the Bulgarians invaded into Bulgaria, where the Bulgarian units are currently occupying the northern part of Bulgaria, and the Bulgarian army has been defeated. It remains to be seen however whether the Bulgarian army will retake Bulgaria from Bulgaria.\n- Since 2009 the Bulgarian military has held 2,000 km of the Balkans and is on a mission to gain some new territory, like the Serbian border, through the Balkan region. From January to April of next year, the Romanian Armed Forces will move further towards the borders ( ).\n- In January 2014 Bulgaria will send its army to Romania to fight against the Romanian army ( ), which had been fighting in the Balkan region for a few months in 2008.

On 14 March 2014, Bulgarian forces recaptured some villages in the eastern part of the country.\n- In September 2008, a border check is held with the Romanian navy so that Romanian troops cannot escape from its territory. The Bulgarian border control over this region is made by the Bulgarian army. In January 2009 the Bulgarian navy entered a large area and destroyed several vehicles which were not captured. A report was prepared that concluded that Romanian troops had already committed atrocities against Romanian troops including the firing of a rifle in front of the town hall. This is one of the most horrific cases in the Bulgarian military history.","token_len":636,"entropy":[11.7847,4.0759,6.318,0.9648,7.6206,5.8291,0.0091,0.2074,4.8886,2.0592,2.6479,7.029,3.4942,0.1892,3.615,7.4645,11.2171,3.6037,5.3684,3.1987,11.57,0.4167,0.0514,1.9452,12.0532,10.2448,6.7615,5.5924,4.8267,4.9749,5.3839,9.3431,15.56,5.8681,5.2373,10.4903,2.896,0.8369,3.0307,1.5844,0.3976,4.6502,2.165,3.0528,5.3057,1.8966,1.707,5.8719,0.0236,4.2115,5.1535,1.794,0.7123,1.5593,2.0848,4.1309,0.0315,5.2363,1.6009,1.2358,0.9799,3.8112,2.2025,1.8414,0.0994,3.9779,4.9927,0.1042,0.9958,2.4038,7.0913,4.2099,3.6774,4.4423,3.8064,3.7592,5.316,3.3794,2.8373,0.1783,1.8633,2.9917,2.9822,4.7804,3.4662,3.2802,0.7174,4.8166,5.1389,5.6505,6.0221,5.0335,0.8132,1.6191,1.1111,5.55,4.8475,4.9498,3.7886,4.2092,0.9923,1.2268,1.1734,0.7902,1.0085,3.8284,1.6895,4.3286,5.1576,3.154,5.4999,2.4704,4.1348,1.0861,0.8025,4.6111,4.2139,1.5249,4.6781,1.5469,1.5813,0.2823,2.3197,5.794,5.5717,4.9374,1.5428,3.2222,0.9171,0.4808,0.3432,0.5096,3.0329,1.3852,2.0918,0.794,3.4331,1.581,4.3658,3.2566,5.1925,3.1092,3.1394,5.6126,3.7341,1.6637,4.3948,4.2798,5.4438,4.9568,4.6293,0.9302,2.9025,3.926,2.7305,2.8333,0.0756,4.0355,1.1672,1.8712,1.9724,1.1017,0.8688,0.3166,0.0651,0.4477,1.1944,0.3264,0.3533,0.0314,0.1619,0.0652,3.1031,0.3622,3.2355,2.7662,2.7402,4.4482,0.3166,4.8498,5.5387,1.4041,1.5995,3.787,2.2104,1.0418,6.834,3.1494,3.2012,3.8436,1.4924,5.2943,1.0206,0.0224,2.8158,2.1354,2.0754,2.2873,1.0019,2.0852,1.6925,1.5378,4.7423,1.1993,4.9636,4.5324,0.8155,0.0041,0.0281,7.2746,1.0412,0.6715,0.4001,1.1244,0.6019,4.3041,1.4474,1.3274,0.6796,1.4718,0.5936,0.2766,5.1818,4.1562,1.4401,0.5036,2.2356,0.353,5.4276,5.8762,2.1248,1.2435,3.2995,0.6362,2.2111,5.6806,2.9083,2.9913,3.5452,1.4848,4.5385,0.2905,5.0005,4.921,5.4182,0.3248,2.7543,5.4531,1.1353,5.2736,1.3541,1.7929,3.8906,1.28,1.9291,0.0025,2.8265,0.6276,5.8827,3.5093,1.8872,2.4889,2.1098,5.2185,0.0427,0.6797,0.7985,4.3638,4.1224,0.0324,1.026,4.072,5.1623,3.7288,0.7513,4.207,4.3895,0.6204,1.0898,0.2258,2.6134,3.6253,2.7438,3.2947,3.6627,3.2085,2.7477,3.0325,0.8296,3.3155,1.5565,2.4094,1.59,0.6046,2.1335,1.4382,2.2688,3.2345,2.2375,4.0264,1.7319,1.9891,1.9228,0.6821,2.5656,0.0047,0.3706,0.8024,2.2548,1.9088,1.0747,3.3285,3.968,0.7423,4.6479,2.0943,3.0986,4.4866,1.0232,4.9899,0.4742,1.5973,2.4542,1.3436,0.0952,4.85,6.1165,2.2857,2.6003,3.5343,1.9684,4.2222,2.001,2.3146,1.8618,0.0091,3.6609,2.3519,3.1244,0.9454,1.0044,7.4097,1.6128,3.1769,0.9673,1.434,0.9157,1.1789,5.9432,1.5589,3.9626,2.653,5.1842,1.2024,3.5182,0.0633,2.5201,5.2232,0.4938,0.0734,5.9544,0.7625,3.3472,5.3396,5.4522,0.7535,4.3502,5.6655,0.6584,4.202,0.015,0.6316,1.3839,0.5384,3.5639,0.3069,4.203,2.3315,5.881,2.5522,0.0046,3.4967,1.05,0.5282,1.0897,5.9104,2.4566,4.3432,0.9024,0.0334,0.9477,2.1646,1.2318,4.0992,3.6691,3.4113,0.8619,0.9483,1.3507,0.2669,0.9259,3.109,1.0573,5.3459,4.2212,5.1358,0.8569,1.8487,0.0857,6.6014,0.7853,5.4985,4.136,5.685,1.0379,0.8146,1.0624,1.7229,4.3554,1.0728,4.6177,1.7704,5.5198,2.5266,2.819,3.9841,1.607,5.9982,3.3079,5.1415,4.0905,1.7594,4.6718,1.1927,2.2168,2.4161,3.2256,2.9089,2.3397,2.3362,1.4458,3.7501,3.3212,0.8389,2.8788,0.4106,1.0309,1.2449,0.2278,3.0393,2.9327,3.1096,4.6103,5.0,0.5997,3.536,5.3897,3.4643,5.8329,4.965,6.0079,0.7587,3.6073,2.5284,3.025,5.7099,1.129,1.1974,0.3452,0.8712,1.2392,5.1322,4.2644,2.7134,0.022,2.2528,0.916,2.0239,1.4062,3.2997,4.3053,0.0407,4.7558,4.1749,0.7948,2.1129,3.6848,4.3838,0.0357,3.1293,5.3267,2.2119,3.7013,2.3065,5.4763,0.8734,3.3263,1.7027,3.5704,5.7748,1.617,3.8782,1.2823,0.2255,0.6219,3.6752,0.0018,3.0354,5.4435,1.6288,5.8954,1.3053,2.3572,0.6558,1.2815,2.3486,3.3897,1.0927,3.6197,1.1166,2.2487,1.2815,2.9506,0.0008,1.9419,1.4571,0.4865,1.3944,2.969,0.2461,0.014,0.4313,0.0715,0.6768,1.1081,0.161,1.6464,2.7704,3.2682,0.9445,3.4868,5.4772,4.8179,4.755,3.6436,3.1098,1.2539,1.0822,7.421,6.4101,0.2355,2.9987,1.2901,3.2892,4.1766,1.4006,5.5038,0.5911,0.42,1.8026,1.493,4.2975,4.2023,4.7424,3.1153,2.5982,0.8768,5.6747,1.3129,0.5974,1.6354,2.5723,0.832,2.4583,3.1909,0.8731,1.1893,0.416,2.1084,3.0415,3.672,4.2891,1.6353,3.0595,5.1207,2.3595,3.74,4.0681,0.772,4.8305,3.8261,1.4418,4.4809,5.8412,2.1814,2.6178,3.4986,6.2251,0.3134,2.365,1.2991,2.439,3.8973,5.8566,3.6935,1.1383,0.9823,1.7203,6.3905,2.359,4.6773,0.2081,3.6407,4.2012,3.2051,3.2645,0.0177,1.1941,6.105,3.5295,1.2924,3.5434,2.2473,4.2055,0.2359,0.1317,1.6338,3.8269,3.2291,1.9936,1.4928,2.9379,1.6148,0.3322,0.3866]}
{"id":4567,"ended":true,"length":604,"gen_text":"The welders who worked on the pipeline itself came from < unk > Local 798 out of Tulsa, Oklahoma, which specialized in providing welders for large @ - @ scale pipeline projects.\n\nIn October, in the wake of those jobs, many local folks voted overwhelmingly for a $25 million public funding program to pay for the pipeline to replace the gas that's currently leaking into its tracks. The goal is to provide $17 million over three decades for pipeline safety before it's finally built.\n\nThe state will also have to buy much less gas than it sold on the spot for what amounts to a $40 million bridge over the Missouri River with two major terminals: one in Oklahoma and another in Oklahoma City.\n\nIn any case, as the news with Texas was the first of a number of stories reporting about the pipeline's long delay, more than 80 people in the community voted to build the $10 billion bridge across the Gulf of Mexico, while the largest group who got the most support from Oklahoma and Oklahoma City to go along with it also voted to get oil on the ground.\n\nOklahoma City Mayor Tom Bates said, \"With this tragedy, we need to get on with moving forward on a $20 billion project based solely on the energy from oil.\"\n\n\"I'm thrilled to see the State of Oklahoma moving in the right direction,\" said State Senator Richard Stenger, who represents the area. \"After decades of neglect, we've seen this happen at the expense of every single life.\"\n\nThe final bill in the legislature would send that $20 billion to the Department of Transportation (DOT), which will pay for the road and repairs needed to make the pipeline complete before it takes shape, then spend the money on other infrastructure projects on the ground in Oklahoma City.\n\nLocal officials at U.S. Department of Transportation, a joint project of the United States Embassy and the National Park Service, were in Washington on Wednesday to talk about the issues raised in the latest news over the last two days.\n\nWhile Gov. Mary Fallin's office was unable to say whether the bridge was funded solely using money from the $100 million, it was clear the state has more money on the table than some anticipated. The bridge would cost $1 trillion.\n\nBut even as the construction was underway, officials at the Oklahoma State Department of Environmental Quality (OSCE) have said oil is flowing into that region of Texas, with additional heavy oil likely coming to Oklahoma. The state is working with OSE and other energy interests to address how, where and how oil would flow off the state's land to arrive.\n\nIf the oil does run out in the coming weeks, that oil would reach more cities like Austin, for example. The only time that would happen is if all of these wells become fully operational by Oct. 31.\n\nThere's another $19 billion in funding for the project for transportation reasons, and it would be a major boost to the state's economy - and particularly to a major oil production region like the Bakken \u2013 but the most important part, they say, is for safety.","token_len":637,"entropy":[13.0707,3.4693,4.1579,3.0358,0.725,0.4253,6.726,7.7168,5.0847,1.3204,12.1612,11.3501,6.3006,5.8256,9.3492,4.609,6.2359,7.6226,0.224,6.5929,0.9358,1.4387,1.8872,3.7083,7.5223,0.0232,5.9263,3.0188,0.3615,2.6055,4.5744,15.7927,6.9805,7.3654,7.9538,3.5835,0.7685,0.5641,2.7661,0.0096,3.3713,4.5652,2.1994,4.9112,2.3576,1.5969,0.0006,6.4552,5.171,1.0981,5.3049,2.6154,4.4825,5.5979,3.6759,1.6302,2.2267,2.2596,3.7685,0.8233,4.9149,2.4682,2.2063,0.8569,3.5564,0.2239,1.2355,1.9689,3.8099,4.313,0.6925,5.9021,3.0936,2.9095,3.0558,2.4584,1.6257,6.1972,4.0483,0.2308,2.2598,4.3072,1.5114,0.2416,3.7474,1.535,5.3112,0.4509,2.7458,2.5363,3.8884,1.5618,4.487,3.2217,6.4102,1.7785,1.1657,3.6759,2.8594,0.4482,0.6557,0.0002,2.2251,4.2897,4.074,1.9284,3.5137,0.5339,4.8145,6.0079,4.4568,2.4756,2.4451,1.4753,5.2879,3.3277,0.7223,4.4216,2.9662,4.8579,4.433,0.0024,0.8491,1.656,4.0281,0.8093,5.6887,1.97,0.7564,1.7721,0.0639,5.5855,5.084,4.3378,5.311,3.9932,3.0465,1.1738,2.4147,1.5293,1.6966,0.1085,2.8865,0.0314,0.3239,0.9405,0.0002,3.5523,5.3539,0.5307,0.023,4.1019,2.0295,4.6836,6.039,5.4022,3.6848,4.7803,2.5267,2.4362,2.5662,3.6414,0.038,3.1624,4.9424,3.4609,0.9139,1.3508,1.6336,5.5124,4.8624,0.8634,5.0594,1.9278,4.6189,1.7886,3.4265,1.4938,2.7277,3.4687,1.2857,5.0472,1.286,2.4073,3.5786,1.7541,2.2254,4.712,0.4008,3.7881,0.5288,0.0019,2.1403,4.7371,2.7112,5.4322,2.7786,4.426,4.4149,1.0551,2.504,1.9833,2.7717,4.5899,3.403,1.4946,0.1929,4.8168,4.469,1.1175,0.0948,1.2779,4.4747,1.8421,1.0912,3.0232,5.8121,2.7044,0.5487,1.1264,0.9005,0.3536,0.0002,5.197,0.0438,1.6194,1.4268,3.0853,1.3526,1.4798,3.1865,0.1574,5.0056,2.1493,5.8988,0.6946,1.1955,2.5286,0.2889,3.6383,3.4698,0.525,5.2289,0.55,3.125,2.4327,4.4206,1.8922,0.2799,1.5839,7.0203,3.9543,0.0385,1.694,3.9015,5.3946,2.4611,2.0423,0.2325,0.0001,3.2129,2.7018,1.6814,4.4245,1.444,1.1863,1.4868,5.1132,0.4065,0.1273,4.4533,3.5632,0.5038,0.1097,0.0036,1.4281,1.0314,3.4076,1.1355,4.898,4.7151,4.3851,0.7204,1.058,2.7745,1.0817,2.1262,0.8714,0.4502,5.8459,3.6717,0.0619,3.109,0.6508,1.6891,2.3494,2.8764,2.409,2.5507,3.5811,1.5416,2.9279,0.0023,4.7853,2.18,4.8529,2.5742,0.1664,0.0001,1.9439,5.6972,4.2474,4.586,0.4929,3.7399,2.3088,5.064,5.0777,1.9156,0.4587,0.0745,0.9282,1.0067,4.115,0.0015,0.7645,3.297,0.1669,0.0046,1.5143,0.8197,2.0686,2.7603,0.1819,0.9787,5.3246,1.3812,5.3846,2.9085,0.468,3.0601,0.4683,1.1042,4.5253,4.1444,1.0966,4.3941,5.1354,3.0998,4.772,4.2801,1.1365,1.0069,0.9909,3.1185,2.396,1.5074,5.6512,0.6029,2.3324,2.4882,1.6832,0.7861,0.7442,0.3452,0.0002,5.838,2.8996,5.1298,5.6521,0.8959,0.0096,0.0394,4.8515,0.0031,0.3832,2.941,4.1914,4.0668,2.2496,0.6044,0.6209,3.9567,0.0501,6.6898,1.2803,0.6446,3.0561,2.541,0.0018,0.2579,3.3167,3.3467,2.565,2.0913,1.8426,0.6936,3.64,0.4043,0.6967,5.5516,2.227,2.1258,0.5777,4.61,2.2313,5.9581,0.2663,2.9519,2.3987,0.9415,0.475,0.4043,0.0002,4.4753,5.6582,0.0035,0.0386,0.0001,0.0013,2.7963,1.0302,3.366,4.2807,0.0136,2.5692,1.4827,1.2952,3.7044,2.4783,4.1619,6.2322,6.0279,4.4535,0.6802,0.829,3.6507,4.1713,0.1905,5.1061,3.4865,2.207,1.6913,2.1854,2.032,3.6603,4.0083,1.015,1.993,1.1331,1.1591,1.6058,4.7086,5.004,0.3253,3.097,3.2846,1.9954,1.5149,0.8278,3.0818,5.9794,2.7915,0.2938,0.0002,3.96,4.335,2.5696,1.1871,5.32,3.2936,1.4871,0.282,3.6719,1.9352,0.5338,3.0248,1.5285,1.4201,0.0225,3.2899,0.3726,1.6578,0.9484,1.3217,0.142,5.022,2.4907,4.8834,2.4773,2.9596,1.129,4.5725,3.3142,1.7853,3.9603,1.8801,4.4541,5.5829,4.8272,2.2867,5.8464,1.7361,3.272,3.5342,2.2365,2.7872,2.3185,1.9584,4.1895,1.0622,3.9457,1.7615,2.6566,0.981,4.3101,5.77,0.4197,3.6675,4.4112,6.4447,2.0452,0.5881,0.4964,2.9046,4.9662,1.2291,5.9819,0.4844,3.5428,0.1575,3.0729,3.4862,5.5731,2.37,0.221,0.0002,4.9029,1.1665,2.3615,3.0498,5.71,1.5216,2.4809,1.0342,2.0476,1.2516,0.3002,3.2258,1.5512,1.6615,4.9117,4.2713,6.5226,3.5164,2.5402,0.5015,5.5872,0.2899,1.4567,2.6495,6.0441,4.5519,1.6905,2.0881,1.9435,0.4697,0.6132,5.4589,1.0888,4.135,5.4219,5.0769,3.3936,0.2633,2.3355,5.1837,0.023,1.8666,0.7159,0.5056,0.0002,4.4999,1.4258,3.9524,3.6326,6.0902,0.7244,1.075,2.7483,1.3333,0.7925,1.7211,4.4898,5.2997,6.0436,0.7129,2.4889,2.4107,1.9474,1.6646,1.9906,2.9183,2.6076,0.5775,0.68,1.1282,0.2867,2.057,6.3683,2.4356,5.9175,1.583,3.965,3.3946,1.5353,4.0887,3.4664,2.1619,2.0057,2.4306,0.0002,6.1618,3.7399,2.2368,5.4366,0.9434,2.1977,4.1846,4.1924,1.1834,0.0161,0.4303,2.955,3.7058,0.5113]}

The female will always catch her prey with one hand and the male with the other, keeping her tail pointed upward to catch the meat with both hands. This will increase his ability to hunt and his abilities to hunt a large group. The male, however, is limited to carrying his mate when he is very young. Males of all other birds will give the lion's mark to every male they see on the ground. He may then catch them as companions or if they want money.

In general, female-sized and male-sized owls will nest in trees within the vicinity of a large structure. In this way you avoid losing access to prey for the long distance between nesting and feeding. The size of their eggshell means that they are relatively small (less than 12 cm in length). Allowing young owls greater access to the large structure will help them to survive longer periods of dormancy.\n\nAs an excellent food source, it is best to eat small prey for the first half hour prior to any predators, especially in early morning until late at night.\n\n, especially in early morning until late at night. The larger size of an adult cougar makes a better defense against predators in large groups. When young is more important, however, it should be carefully hunted for food.\n\nThe young animal will not chase its prey out of the grass, even in daylight.\n\n. As adults, they don't attack people or animals but prefer to live near the bush itself. They hide and live out long distances and they often attack large animals when they are alone, while doing so at night. One of the more difficult to control when watching natural prey can be disturbed by the appearance of predators. It is a good indicator of the shape and size of the young cougar. If the young are a regular cougar, it will be very easy to detect small predators in the bush, while at the same time, when one encounters prey, he may be able to track them.","token_len":637,"entropy":[9.2038,7.8583,5.7829,12.1316,1.6631,2.6488,9.997,0.1807,3.018,4.1145,2.5588,2.6645,1.8009,1.3673,2.8286,1.3566,3.9509,4.235,0.4345,4.166,8.067,0.7289,0.0827,3.3465,13.6842,4.1567,3.4177,2.8314,5.997,2.4295,5.0325,0.2174,1.826,1.8888,3.7868,4.9175,0.0385,1.1058,0.0458,1.6242,5.8044,5.7579,1.5696,1.448,0.5697,1.647,4.184,5.1109,5.7133,3.3775,5.2287,1.8434,5.4104,1.7404,6.7458,0.0224,4.8155,2.162,0.2988,0.0007,0.0353,0.0236,0.0105,0.0047,0.0036,0.001,0.0038,0.0007,0.0005,0.0314,0.0015,0.0131,0.0042,0.0004,4.7661,0.0022,0.5801,0.0086,0.0064,0.0034,0.0006,0.0008,0.0015,0.0006,0.0005,0.0446,0.0038,0.0008,0.0008,0.0068,0.0007,0.0018,0.0012,0.0014,0.0008,0.0012,0.0015,0.0024,0.0003,0.0084,0.0018,0.0018,0.0025,2.2911,4.1886,3.7061,3.442,0.1916,0.0146,0.0022,0.056,2.7086,5.685,3.3805,6.549,2.7885,0.7095,5.5645,2.057,3.8789,2.0286,3.1121,2.3743,5.0033,1.2562,5.3051,2.7284,0.6164,2.7511,2.1906,2.0512,3.695,4.8197,2.3282,1.7964,3.2381,3.1982,0.489,1.3251,2.2196,0.328,1.3318,0.3103,0.0072,1.3231,4.7329,1.4592,5.3652,3.4524,3.3344,2.4449,1.8109,1.4498,5.8809,4.6427,2.4304,0.3872,0.5335,3.0765,3.8349,4.6973,4.6418,2.4519,0.0175,2.2059,1.3828,4.169,5.5251,0.5119,2.1791,4.9749,1.8311,2.3625,1.5954,0.9202,0.0002,1.584,1.1404,0.0016,0.0003,0.0051,0.0006,0.0134,0.0007,0.0071,0.0273,0.0065,0.001,0.0014,0.0009,0.0017,0.0024,0.0044,0.0034,0.0103,0.0001,0.0008,0.0013,0.0005,0.005,0.6763,0.0012,0.0029,0.0009,0.0052,0.0021,0.0007,0.0004,0.0006,0.0041,0.0025,0.0028,0.002,0.0035,0.0019,0.0002,0.0006,0.0696,0.0019,0.0335,0.0071,0.0012,0.0025,0.0027,0.0026,0.0012,0.0023,0.0007,0.0008,0.0039,0.001,0.0004,0.0048,0.0034,0.0007,0.0016,0.0009,0.0018,0.0071,0.0007,0.003,0.0049,0.0043,0.002,0.0007,0.7525,1.2633,3.1276,2.346,0.0045,1.599,6.0095,0.7875,5.0419,3.1792,4.3505,5.1008,0.9622,0.6713,4.7389,0.2448,0.8788,5.0773,2.8379,2.1766,3.1566,2.744,1.2215,5.5021,3.1218,6.0607,2.3314,3.5864,1.4144,5.066,1.7927,1.2964,1.2168,3.9948,0.7362,1.0629,1.1309,3.6235,3.0606,4.4274,5.1882,2.5071,3.351,6.4378,2.015,4.6794,1.3955,3.7175,7.7194,1.2928,3.6069,4.8621,1.4026,4.96,1.5679,0.0852,1.7413,0.4197,0.7266,0.3849,4.1234,3.6454,1.1339,2.7776,0.3569,0.0249,1.0763,1.2124,3.3867,1.1343,0.722,0.0002,4.8804,0.245,0.0798,0.0174,0.0025,0.0022,0.012,0.0002,0.0023,0.0018,0.0106,0.0002,0.0006,3.4578,2.647,0.191,5.32,5.5393,3.3919,4.191,1.752,0.0744,0.3077,6.512,0.0018,1.7968,5.5198,1.0912,3.4311,5.3919,1.8748,4.1072,0.1288,1.8673,2.2965,5.6941,1.1216,2.9307,2.6087,0.754,6.7061,5.7217,5.7342,5.0957,0.0461,4.3878,4.1325,1.7726,4.4878,3.3445,3.0166,2.662,1.4409,4.1457,0.6346,2.9332,4.6695,0.3217,3.9425,4.7272,2.155,4.6735,0.5354,1.1399,1.8037,4.7218,1.2215,3.4477,3.7866,0.0049,4.4187,1.2411,2.0657,0.8523,1.4168,5.8074,4.2019,5.4027,1.2434,0.0014,5.8404,2.0545,0.2652,2.139,4.095,1.5686,2.0537,2.0498,1.0637,1.6148,2.1827,1.3897,2.5361,0.2181,5.695,0.0022,0.8191,0.6589,0.0002,5.0368,3.008,5.3831,4.0258,0.2456,0.5246,3.7339,0.324,2.9234,0.2585,2.7218,2.9816,2.6012,4.4533,1.4212,1.5846,5.0003,2.8931,4.8876,0.0033,4.6204,3.3916,2.7119,2.8135,2.5654,4.405,1.7475,5.5724,2.3398,2.0386,0.0038,0.4382,1.786,0.0002,8.044,3.5914,0.0104,0.0066,0.0009,0.0047,0.01,0.0008,0.0031,0.0007,2.1814,4.5772,4.0178,0.1152,2.7216,2.3666,2.1662,0.001,3.2769,3.9409,4.8597,5.9881,0.4266,1.3164,3.7563,3.8392,0.9918,0.7064,4.1531,4.6908,6.0581,3.9581,2.592,0.9219,4.1944,0.0135,1.6975,4.0336,0.4122,5.3184,5.3814,1.9554,1.4028,1.3531,0.8078,0.0002,2.7132,4.7154,5.3027,1.6052,2.8457,5.1221,2.7646,0.4168,4.6919,0.1074,0.8353,6.6269,1.8908,4.5166,2.6171,5.945,0.5668,1.5924,0.0002,5.8759,4.2186,6.657,0.2059,3.0044,5.1734,0.0015,3.9124,3.9858,1.9155,1.7004,4.5286,5.1103,0.3197,4.0138,4.0183,1.882,3.8522,5.8254,0.4617,2.5464,6.1831,3.1128,4.073,4.754,5.7649,0.5569,2.8516,4.654,3.667,5.3006,3.9111,2.224,3.8964,0.6915,1.1704,3.0141,2.73,5.264,5.4303,0.206,5.6269,0.4487,0.3751,6.4478,1.553,0.1377,3.9264,3.7475,4.2456,2.7512,4.9368,5.4563,6.0423,3.1009,4.3629,0.1894,5.6639,0.9046,1.8406,4.5862,0.0579,3.2528,0.8509,3.8053,0.4115,3.448,1.01,8.4956,0.4703,1.3615,5.4647,1.3742,0.6539,0.0157,0.6764,4.8046,2.2805,0.008,1.3429,2.9724,1.6316,0.6643,2.066,4.8942,6.1869,4.1469,0.0017,0.4536,1.5241,1.6356,1.9322,2.5733,2.3544,0.2742,2.6708,4.6678,1.3493,2.9983,1.0333,2.1678,2.2537,4.2308,2.797,0.5851,0.0132,0.0015,2.1647,4.4346,5.0374,3.3239,4.5765,1.8516,5.0445,2.1605,1.5397,1.4644,0.0081,4.3797,1.1967,1.5117]}
{"id":3782,"ended":true,"length":563,"gen_text":"In addition to the four tropical cyclones of the season, there were four others with only a single point on their track, due to the sparsity of data. The barque W.B.W.N. was in the thick of action and on the short of action, but was in serious play when it hit the top of the SES in February. The RACO cyclone M7, which broke on March 26th, has lost four of its ten tracks after coming up short of the SES this week, and will have much less chance of succeeding at the SES this week.\n\nFinally, there have been five tropical cyclones with a single set of tracks and a short of action on their course but for the most part, the long chain of events the SES produces is very much more variable than the usual long chain, making the overall course a little less predictable.\n\nThe second major category is the large-scale change in the frequency and intensity of the long chain. In its previous, less frequent, full cycle, the SES had been able to reduce its average activity by only a few megatons, while in this change in intensity, the long chain has been able to break a few miles away.\n\nWe do not have data on the timing of the next major tropical cyclone but we did find this, which will impact on the likelihood of success of the next five tropical cyclones.\n\nIf the SES is to become stronger, it is unlikely that there will be a change in the course because of a more intense series of cyclones.\n\nOverall, it is possible to predict a better record of tropical cyclones under the NRC, if we give some consideration to previous forecasts. In the NRC, a record is likely for a long distance tropical cyclone, a little stronger than in the SES.\n\nIt is important to note that, in any case, we may not be able to predict the occurrence of the next big cycle, given the current course.\n\nI am also aware that the SES was not particularly good for any other tropical cyclone, as the usual short term, prolonged run over the course of a given month often took several years.\n\nThus, any change in risk for tropical cyclones in the forecasted interval is likely to depend on the long term trajectory and the severity of the activity. However, given that there are still a number of uncertainties in the course of an activity, we can confidently say that we can expect that tropical cyclones will be quite stronger.\n\nFinally, even though it is not quite as strong as the long-term mean long run record, it is still good for tropical cyclones, given the present record for cyclones.\n\nYou can find all of the NRC long-term

{"id":2646,"ended":true,"length":601,"gen_text":"Written and originally produced by Michael Jackson Produced, edited and mixed by Dave Loughran Executive producer : Adrian Grant for Key Concerts & Entertainment Vocal arrangement by John Maher Music arranged and performed by Michael Jackson & Mark Bock for Key Concerts and Entertainment Theme park entrance\n\nThe Jackson Family\n\nWith its massive fortune, its wealth and the high-speed movement in the art world, America is a rich place. We have been here long enough to know that our country is not without its great assets.\n\nIt is a country that is better where everything is at stake. With the exception of the United States itself, the West is rich. It's a country that has done fine for so long; one that knows how to win over its children to our ways.\n\nAnd what a place our country is now.\n\nWe still have more wealth than ever before, and our military is growing faster than anyone realized. Our companies can compete against any major competition, and the new laws give them the ability to compete to our size. We have the highest incomes in the world; some of the best manufacturing and manufacturing in the world, and our leaders know it. We have the richest people in the world.\n\nWe know what's happening in the world when our leaders get elected. We know where the progress is and the changes are happening. The politicians will see this as success and start taking action.\n\nThe next president will announce new policies, and this will provide the political impetus for further investment. We know this will be a tough place for a president to be. As long as you stay in power, the United States will get better and we will get better.\n\nIt is not necessary to have a great president by birth or early death. That is their job and this is their job; they are accountable to the people and their governments to maintain the status quo.\n\nIn this sense, we are still in a position. Let's make that part of this country a safer place.\n\nWe are still a place where people can be happy when they are free, and still be good people when they are left behind. If you want, you can get there. If you desire, you can come here.\n\nThe United States will do what President Truman put forward in 1948, which was to make the United States a great nation. He had one goal: to put Americans first. We can make ourselves a great nation now. We can make America Great again. The job of the first man to lead the entire world is to turn it around and put America First.\n\nWe have made America Great.\n\nIf you are a president and your nation is still good, and if you want, you can join me \u2014 to make this country a great country again. But let's stay together. Let's make that the big deal.\n\nSo don't forget this simple message: \"Let's keep together.\" We are not talking the same, we are talking about a better thing. It is no longer possible to become the leader of your country without breaking with the shackles that are around you.","token_len":638,"entropy":[3.7764,7.9423,4.2584,0.6221,5.928,4.3079,8.9636,0.0476,5.7267,3.4689,0.9079,3.4494,0.0366,5.2136,5.1369,6.5411,2.2499,5.7249,4.9954,9.6326,7.4475,7.0881,7.0676,8.4504,9.5779,1.0274,3.6844,5.1919,7.0771,2.526,7.9663,0.7068,3.8757,9.7023,4.1001,6.781,2.9218,2.4311,0.0141,3.638,0.6172,2.8742,3.9134,5.1012,5.144,3.2542,1.179,0.1807,0.0121,2.2366,0.0656,5.3276,6.7665,5.505,3.6255,0.0169,3.1219,5.0827,3.0276,2.9533,0.0004,5.7842,3.6257,5.5385,5.1067,0.9811,3.2871,4.9988,0.9609,2.6143,5.5694,1.899,4.1755,5.0768,4.2968,1.354,5.7132,0.8343,0.2869,5.8936,1.7648,2.2067,4.0776,1.5584,1.1063,4.0039,2.0888,3.1215,3.4475,2.5008,0.5206,0.582,0.4526,0.6543,3.0196,2.6024,0.9213,2.5777,3.9691,0.6247,3.415,4.23,0.7102,3.0775,0.0002,3.7141,0.6748,2.4494,1.9916,1.397,1.8417,5.325,5.7492,4.3348,0.7798,4.9861,0.499,0.6525,5.0513,1.8558,3.9655,0.0053,1.3968,4.0667,0.0348,4.0389,0.1457,1.7647,5.9208,1.3381,5.0394,1.8579,2.4204,3.1189,1.1322,0.3744,0.4347,1.4994,4.8778,5.9002,2.6437,2.5968,0.1665,4.73,4.0284,0.4157,4.8691,1.1629,0.1284,3.3078,2.7199,1.6233,3.7493,2.8602,4.0866,5.2413,0.8331,1.0477,0.0002,3.1663,4.2644,2.1035,3.3388,3.8993,1.042,0.6946,4.8868,0.5216,0.7931,0.0002,2.7331,5.1464,0.851,3.9379,2.7937,0.6583,3.0196,0.223,1.2196,1.3594,2.6907,5.3955,1.4159,3.039,2.3528,0.2033,4.8793,4.9439,0.3281,2.3545,5.5212,4.639,2.7674,4.0531,3.8063,4.056,4.7553,1.8314,0.7563,2.8521,4.7686,5.7445,6.0279,1.8717,1.4248,1.8492,0.016,2.5596,4.115,3.9734,4.5875,0.5578,2.0814,1.4808,2.434,3.5728,5.267,0.469,0.1568,0.6722,2.9984,6.2712,0.865,0.4336,2.0558,4.1504,2.2829,2.8048,1.8245,0.0659,0.1025,1.5478,0.6455,2.1004,5.4701,3.766,2.7639,0.1877,1.9706,0.8462,0.8657,5.2369,2.2625,0.3699,0.1143,0.0915,1.5085,1.1086,0.0001,1.495,4.2363,2.8038,2.5919,2.4818,0.9203,1.2211,0.4993,5.2712,2.6606,2.469,4.1365,3.905,0.6405,0.9796,0.3319,3.7974,1.8878,5.3319,0.5638,2.9863,3.4641,5.1863,0.7506,1.5903,0.4214,3.9111,5.6883,4.2873,4.6875,3.14,1.8565,6.8572,1.4353,4.6137,3.4553,1.277,0.6105,1.1275,0.0001,2.5685,4.2502,1.1974,0.6976,5.4697,3.8296,1.2491,2.1339,1.3924,4.4746,0.8804,5.6076,2.0116,4.1655,4.046,0.9967,4.8708,2.6019,1.568,2.0409,3.0307,2.5295,1.6549,1.4206,1.08,4.3558,4.38,1.3929,3.3482,1.7102,0.6466,1.3323,1.1492,5.2345,3.6282,0.0118,4.0579,3.7175,1.9531,2.7498,0.2867,2.4123,3.4743,0.0027,0.6845,4.6428,2.0905,2.0522,3.01,0.3162,0.7261,0.4654,0.2432,0.3589,0.0001,3.7186,1.1195,2.7402,5.9082,0.6502,3.4354,1.1788,3.0311,1.7964,6.4084,5.5389,1.7674,5.01,1.6373,0.6321,4.1904,0.9685,5.8523,1.8147,3.2451,4.3247,0.507,1.3045,1.1387,4.0634,1.3656,1.4816,5.9184,0.4684,1.2962,0.4707,1.9161,3.2544,5.3944,3.4245,5.3736,1.3813,2.1848,0.0016,0.2934,0.7768,0.0001,3.8404,2.3574,4.5195,0.1978,1.64,1.1144,4.291,1.6873,1.338,3.0854,2.969,6.1899,0.5136,3.3185,3.6681,5.7309,0.0832,2.8791,2.12,2.1805,5.2543,0.058,0.7529,1.0334,0.0001,1.9431,1.7072,2.0768,2.2324,3.3683,0.5652,2.4125,1.5211,2.7367,3.289,5.2967,0.5278,1.4583,3.7663,1.8334,1.4513,6.0115,1.3326,5.7241,1.7123,0.4212,0.0838,0.637,5.1028,0.6731,0.2143,4.4803,1.3042,2.0247,4.8552,0.6212,0.0931,2.7974,2.7794,1.1682,1.4229,0.0542,7.4092,0.3659,0.1388,0.0453,4.3924,1.6393,0.334,0.964,0.0001,2.514,2.8789,0.0059,3.4992,4.231,2.5064,6.5876,5.0894,4.3099,3.0068,1.735,3.0703,1.5983,2.4526,0.5948,0.2648,2.4072,1.7003,2.0155,0.0402,1.049,2.7945,1.3002,0.7402,3.4615,3.9843,5.055,1.7839,0.845,0.7397,4.1961,4.0304,1.2104,0.657,2.8943,3.3918,3.5692,5.9161,1.5271,0.5428,0.6667,3.261,0.7106,1.8842,0.709,1.0586,1.793,4.8458,0.7353,0.204,4.2218,5.936,0.5903,1.202,5.0922,5.44,1.9774,2.5391,1.2838,5.4845,0.7267,0.4379,0.6405,4.825,2.4883,1.2404,1.6933,4.1374,2.202,1.5359,0.2211,0.4572,0.0001,2.0233,1.6626,3.6069,3.0441,0.8016,1.2231,1.7165,0.0002,4.0895,1.1739,2.6623,1.5058,5.0647,3.019,3.516,5.2538,0.568,2.8631,4.5149,0.3419,2.8113,1.6376,0.2579,1.4793,2.964,0.2676,0.0532,4.4465,2.7838,7.9009,3.8921,2.3532,2.7794,0.8575,2.1855,0.4291,1.7984,0.8819,0.3733,4.7282,3.4425,0.7514,4.9277,1.8555,0.7902,1.3494,0.035,2.1426,4.4256,3.5514,5.455,3.5077,0.3197,0.7234,0.0001,4.4407,5.049,0.0007,3.0769,3.0116,5.7977,1.8294,1.1577,3.156,3.1526,0.3246,2.57,4.4262,1.1818,2.637,1.7507,1.9379,4.2536,5.0904,2.4589,5.5679,1.367,0.0614,0.1882,2.0153,2.5853,3.4627,5.9722,0.2614,3.947,0.7689,5.2811,1.0696,2.9789,0.4009,4.5229,2.4819,2.779,0.772,2.0911,1.0019,2.2803,4.4147,1.4723,0.9525,5.5048,0.0069,2.7953,3.0065,5.8594,0.6704,0.268]}

The first six dukes of Canterbury were chosen for their chanonry status: the Duke of York was chosen to represent'the college in the medieval period (see Chartulary). In the'15th century, four more of the'college were added to the order.\n\nThe chanonry was also used during the reign of Nicholas II (1548\u201386) to celebrate the death of the Emperor Edward III (1597\u20131612). It represents the age of the king's rule at the beginning of the second millennium AD\u2014 the reign of which coincides with the era when the archbishop's chanonry was being expanded to the present day.\n\nThe chanonry was first used during the reign of the Duke Edward III and is generally found in the cloister, and in the chapel at the Palace of Westminster. It was made possible during the second millennium AD by the incorporation of Edward's chapel in Westminster Abbey in which the Chapel of London and the Palace of Westminster were located.\n\nThere are 2,944 diaconates of chanonry in the Church of England. Of these, 587 will be chaneled.\n\nThe chanonry was used throughout the 15th century, when the 'chapman' is the common name of the order (see Chapters 4-6. The two chaneled priests of Canterbury were the Prince of Wales and Prince Philip. The three chaneled monks were the Prince Andrew, Prince William and Prince Philip.)\n\nIn the early 14th century, in honour of the centennial of Charles II (1545\u20131624), the chaneled monks of Canterbury were honoured with the'' in the Latin title'monasteries'(see Encyclopaedia Britannica), which was the title of the monastery where the chanonry was kept. In the same year, the monks began using the monastic title chancery, referring to the chanonry itself. The term'the'began to be used by a large number of monks. The name'the monastic'was first commonly seen in Christian liturgy.\n\nAfter the 13th century, monks became familiar with the chanonry, and the chaneled monks became more and more closely associated with the religious order.\n\nFrom the 14th century, chanonaries were recognised as a'royal family in the order that existed before the 16th century. The chanonary was also known as a'family in the'Royal Family.' One chanonary was known as 'Prince Nicholas of Canterbury' in his time, and another as''Prince Elizabeth of Canterbury' in 1713, which is also used by most of the monks. Most monasteries, including those of the'monasteries'of Canterbury, retain chanels.

In 1973 he was commissioned as editor of the English Language Bulletin after leading and leading the campaign to have the English language on the National Register of Students. Due to the successful support of the UK and Singapore for this campaign, he was awarded the National Award of Excellence in English in 1971.

As a graduate of the Graduate School of the University of Kent in 1973, Mr. Kang received a Bachelor of Science degree in the English Language and Cultural Studies field from the University of Birmingham, and an MSc in English from Nottingham University. After joining Student Development Centre at Oxford University, he worked as a tutor for student leaders. Later in 1974 Mr. Kang wrote for the Guardian and was a consultant to various newspapers relating to student life, but never published. In 1975, he founded the London Post Company. When he finished his university career (1972-74), he had moved to the U.S. where he joined the editorial staff of the Boston Globe. In 1981 he began work of professional writing in Hong Kong.

{"id":2058,"ended":true,"length":592,"gen_text":"The 2 @. @ 57 km ( 1 @. @ 60 mi ) Butetown Link Road ( Welsh : Ffordd Gyswllt Butetown ) between the Ferry Road Interchange ( 51 @. @ 76 km ) and the South Downs Rd ( 51 @. @ 77 km ) At this junction, you can make up for any distance lost by making the connection through the South Downs Rd, connecting two crossings of the Link Road on the left.\n\nStep four \u2013 Follow the road (north and south of the junction) up the bridge on the main boulevard where it leads to the ferry-stop. In the following diagram, you have taken advantage of the new junction feature which makes the bridge more visible. The main boulevard on the right connects the boat lane to the boat lane on the left, which is very convenient as you can easily make long \"jumps\"-like dives to the port and keep the boat out of the water without taking advantage of the new junction feature. Also take a long run down the ferry-stop, to an off-street and the dock area where you will have some of the best views of the bridge.\n\nStep five \u2013 The link is open on the left for four hours on a daily basis with no service.\n\nWe encourage your journey to get to the site where you've made the connection. Our approach to this, which will take you right alongside the bridge, is easy enough as it offers a view of the Great Pyrenees and surrounding areas.\n\nIf you wish to visit the site of this site directly instead, that's as clear and intuitive of an experience as we can get. But we will only be making these direct trips when you arrive at Hove Beach, just 15 km from the boat end of the bridge. So, if you want to stay with us at the Hove beach, then you'll need to visit the website for the Hove Beach Boat House where we deliver our services. We also provide services that will take you directly to the beach!\n\nWe are happy to tell you that it is only when you are ready to embark that you can leave the bridge. However, we are confident that, because of the long journey to Great Pyrenees, we will be able to offer a more extensive and exciting visit to Hove Beach as you explore the beautiful coastline of Hove Bay. When you do leave Hove Beach, we ask for your permission to disembark. We look forward to seeing you aboard our latest boat and to seeing you aboard the first of our new tour boats.\n\nWe thank you again for taking the time to visit our website and to provide you with the best experience. We have also made arrangements that we will send you a boat from Hove Beach at an incredible price.\n\nYou are welcome to ask all of our staff what they would like to see on our website. We want to hear your feedback about the boat you want to see on your journeys to Hove Beach and to share with our staff about our boat and our new tour boats.

{"id":1496,"ended":false,"length":619,"gen_text":"The term `` AI winter `` was coined by researchers who had survived the funding cuts of 1974 when they became concerned that enthusiasm for expert systems had spiraled out of control and that disappointment with the academic community was palpable. According to those scientists, many scientists believed that technology would eventually eliminate artificial intelligence. Many would continue using existing AI platforms to test new programs that they had developed, as well as develop new methods that could potentially improve human performance. According to some researchers, AI was finally coming of age.\n\nIt is a wonder what AI would be like without human workers. With human workers, AI would likely do far better than we would be able to use computer programs alone. To this day, I am never able to figure out what AI is but, with humans, the human hand is an important one. I do not know what a human hand is but, I do know that human-machine interfaces with machines will be relatively simple. There will be no need for human intervention, or any kind of technical, technical, or scientific work. This has taken my mind off the idea of AI.\n\nI also think that what I see as a great change in the way AI will become part of the everyday life of mankind is what I term a global collapse. Our current system of AI is already based on the assumption that humans will all be dead, which will set in motion the demise of AI. I am concerned that what is happening is similar to the situation facing AI research today. There is already very little of that technology in research labs and most people have never heard of that technology. That's a huge step backwards, and one which will only become more and more prevalent as the tech world becomes further developed and technology is constantly evolving.\n\nThat is why AI is in need of the help of governments, NGOs and even a little bit of ordinary people to bring about that change. If we are not able to put an end to that development, we will see that those with money will just starve over and over. The only thing that will save us, and only when it is possible, will be an AI that will be able to work for humans; and, it will replace the human employees. That is something I would hope many people will talk about.\n\nYou mentioned that we do not yet have a solution to the problem of AI. The problem of computer code is one of the major problems for humanity and there are millions of computers in existence. We are already doing very high levels of work on the problem of AI. As a community we are starting, working, to help some of these high level professionals in the field. I think it is worth seeing if we can finally fix that.\n\nI am more convinced that we need better software support and human support.

{"id":1135,"ended":true,"length":560,"gen_text":"Although Per\u00f3n had undergone a hysterectomy performed by the American surgeon George T. Pack, the cancer had metastasized and returned rapidly. She was the first Argentine to undergo chemotherapy ( a novel treatment for the cancer ) that did not involve radiation treatment or prolonged stays at home\n\nPer\u00f3n did have a second cancer, cancer of the lymphatic system\n\nAnthropogalactic treatment\n\nPer\u00f3n's third and final breast cancer\n\nHer four daughters had been diagnosed after Per\u00f3n's first operation.\n\nIt is reported that doctors at Per\u00f3n's home at the time of her diagnosis gave Per\u00f3n $40,000 for her care. On top of that, the insurance company that insured Per\u00f3n said that her health had deteriorated due to \"inadvertently being treated twice, at which point she is now living at home with her husband, who has Alzheimer's disease\".\n\nOne of the doctors at the hospital told Per\u00f3n that she would have to wait for three years before applying for permission to use her hospitalization home. She was also told to get a second opinion about her health.\n\nHer decision to end her cancer was not accepted by the doctors and the hospital refused. As a result, Per\u00f3n spent the last two months in Mexico City, where there were no radiation treatment, where the cancer continued to spread. When Per\u00f3n was transferred back to Mexico, she developed a condition called cancer of the breast. At the time she was the first to receive chemotherapy. She found herself in a hospital the same day that Per\u00f3n suffered her first mammogram\n\nPer\u00f3n was born three months before El Dorado. She went into labour three days before El Dorado due to an unexpected incision in her abdomen caused by the birth of her fourth daughter, and was admitted in August 2010.\n\nAs the cancer spread, Per\u00f3n was very ill. She was diagnosed with a severe form of the virus F. rassivirus. Her doctors at Per\u00f3n's home told doctors that Per\u00f3n was going to receive radiation treatment but she refused it. An even more alarming aspect of this story was that for the next three years, her health got worse, because of her cancer.\n\nAccording to the Mexican Cancer Agency (Azequ\u00eda de la Investigaci\u00f3n de Medialatico Psicolog\u00eda), the US Department of The Treasury has estimated that one third of the population should be at risk of becoming infected with cancer, with one in 10 likely to be in the country with F. rassivirus. A major reason for this, according to American researchers, is that high level of exposure to cancer can dramatically increase the risk.\n\nPerin is one of 10 patients who are currently receiving breast care (along with two other women).

Other manga adaptations were released in Japan (except for Koto's Sh\u016bchani Shub\u014d Sh\u014dshitsu no Sh\u014d-Tsuki ) and Korea (Kotobukiya no Sunkain ), but a new series of volumes were published for both territories by Shonen Jump in 2008.\n\nNotes [ edit ]","token_len":642,"entropy":[11.7013,2.6398,3.0306,9.4426,0.4443,10.8822,11.6443,5.1565,6.822,7.7517,0.4105,3.8539,5.2407,5.4829,0.033,0.605,6.4254,5.2122,0.1291,14.4625,6.3655,1.8862,7.8875,0.7781,0.0047,5.5967,1.3114,0.0295,7.5956,3.7142,5.2903,3.8179,0.6429,2.7244,1.4829,1.4146,4.9782,2.7,0.4538,7.3654,10.8775,3.6072,1.0594,2.4187,2.5607,4.5526,4.478,5.0249,5.3743,4.5344,3.6304,1.4597,4.9021,4.4042,5.2893,5.2578,1.7626,3.8779,5.4926,1.2893,0.0747,4.6885,4.2157,2.959,0.7937,4.4677,0.6376,5.1706,3.1436,0.7157,4.4392,0.049,0.0271,0.0739,1.4515,3.2646,6.0106,3.001,4.3368,5.2339,1.0233,1.5881,1.6646,1.4847,0.0014,4.7895,4.5756,7.0378,5.952,3.176,1.6141,1.4331,5.1915,2.8807,0.0002,4.0847,2.9566,4.2162,1.3742,4.6793,4.4831,5.6759,4.3206,0.0508,0.0203,0.0019,0.0001,2.3064,2.3241,3.9901,0.0002,3.7647,3.012,0.1032,4.8244,0.0002,2.2713,5.7155,0.884,2.5303,1.6886,3.7227,2.6758,0.2835,0.0236,0.0038,0.0831,0.0003,0.0032,2.6419,0.8533,1.2025,4.4502,3.0371,3.2253,0.2082,0.0048,2.0543,0.0066,0.0086,5.5478,3.5793,3.637,1.4816,3.6592,5.2497,1.6148,4.712,5.888,4.7147,6.4133,4.7279,0.4367,0.1101,0.9769,3.5452,4.3888,1.4793,3.863,8.0141,3.7748,2.1352,4.3388,0.9475,0.3761,3.1522,1.9446,3.6073,0.3825,0.0286,0.0084,0.0659,0.0001,0.0038,1.9183,4.5804,1.1093,6.4446,1.5866,0.0648,0.339,0.4759,3.1748,4.2604,5.067,6.1489,3.9314,5.9651,3.8718,4.2071,0.1257,0.2537,1.7728,1.2252,1.2534,4.3206,5.5962,3.4445,5.1668,2.1627,4.7049,0.8579,0.7058,0.3568,1.8559,1.7596,1.8233,3.1082,1.4834,3.0791,5.4911,4.1745,1.809,5.321,0.8447,0.1168,0.0366,0.5019,0.0004,0.0055,0.1054,3.6937,2.9244,4.31,1.0772,0.6154,3.8344,2.5001,0.7037,0.708,0.0001,5.3403,4.4728,0.0698,5.1831,0.02,2.8333,4.3494,2.7169,5.1037,2.3217,2.425,2.6183,0.9385,5.4442,5.3246,6.2622,4.2806,3.9491,3.4119,2.6148,5.5028,1.4063,2.603,2.9142,4.9384,2.2638,0.4257,4.3105,1.4993,1.6835,2.9992,1.209,3.9516,1.4918,2.8155,3.0532,2.3446,2.3551,2.8219,0.004,0.3928,2.5636,5.1264,1.4374,3.6155,3.8336,5.8367,2.8198,3.8359,2.8873,5.1534,0.7201,5.0923,5.0837,0.503,2.2399,1.7795,0.1125,0.0104,0.3764,0.0042,0.012,4.8889,0.6783,0.0105,6.0286,3.2815,2.9404,3.5998,4.256,1.5013,3.1869,1.078,3.5179,2.0979,1.3015,0.3247,2.953,3.0395,5.0336,0.4917,4.9257,5.5047,5.5468,2.7091,4.5616,3.2193,0.2266,2.6918,5.1817,3.0406,5.4087,0.1897,5.7649,2.9,1.4913,2.8244,4.0105,2.85,3.9069,0.8377,5.4226,0.3556,0.4249,0.0182,3.6414,0.1192,0.0981,0.9739,5.1797,2.1357,5.746,4.8809,1.8268,4.0092,3.5602,5.7209,0.4163,0.7247,5.0545,0.2119,0.0448,3.735,1.7094,4.8548,0.9339,1.9989,2.6816,1.4754,4.2833,1.2744,1.2569,0.0002,2.7688,1.7299,2.1977,3.195,0.7662,4.0968,0.6316,2.1381,0.0157,0.0218,0.0704,6.391,5.4376,0.0133,5.9722,4.4513,0.8894,3.2327,2.6194,3.6782,2.142,0.1126,1.2622,5.5051,5.7409,4.0167,0.8693,1.1689,2.7824,2.7766,6.4476,2.3628,3.8413,0.6324,4.4465,5.0811,3.9623,5.406,1.5329,2.4581,3.6386,0.1799,2.3761,4.7088,0.6548,5.4754,2.7816,0.0492,0.007,0.1945,0.0003,0.0074,4.1172,1.7308,1.5733,0.0002,2.9132,0.6739,0.0322,0.0063,0.1656,0.0018,0.0094,3.6117,0.8827,4.1062,4.321,0.1038,0.5567,5.3527,4.6368,3.3229,4.7857,2.8912,6.283,2.443,3.7128,1.3318,4.8066,2.5612,2.2872,1.4224,5.461,2.925,4.0383,5.5869,5.4312,1.2601,1.0474,1.9626,6.6167,3.5617,1.6016,1.3515,5.0515,1.9089,0.6253,0.0547,0.0053,0.1539,0.0023,0.0121,1.1483,0.4406,1.9167,1.9344,5.7672,0.562,1.3258,5.8193,4.791,1.1695,0.7405,0.0338,0.262,0.4157,0.0055,0.0037,0.0151,0.0004,0.0113,0.386,0.1359,0.0786,0.7293,5.8736,1.8476,0.0978,0.0072,0.2873,0.3724,0.0185,0.2017,0.3606,0.0857,1.8179,2.96,2.7685,4.8232,4.4176,1.2886,0.9783,0.1081,0.3288,0.2019,0.0887,8.9312,7.8646,3.5096,4.9052,1.4563,0.5757,2.8724,0.5826,0.8136,0.4854,1.1164,0.3936,0.1259,1.0662,0.1846,6.2192,0.6439,1.421,3.7058,0.7818,0.1057,5.3537,4.9106,2.4402,1.6781,0.3883,3.2596,0.4634,0.2307,0.7266,0.0754,0.0069,0.0747,0.044,0.2262,0.1837,0.0222,4.1718,0.9925,2.4685,2.0337,2.1417,3.6062,0.0689,1.4691,1.162,0.084,0.5012,0.0033,0.0075,0.0701,5.0075,2.0578,2.962,3.5834,0.0217,0.7859,0.0598,0.3916,2.0328,0.1965,0.2431,5.5033,2.7296,1.2253,1.2792,2.7354,1.3714,2.0764,3.8418,5.4839,1.0824,4.4945,5.7354,3.861,1.5615,1.9496,4.4672,0.0701,0.2333,0.7059,0.0579,0.2146,0.0548,4.1307,0.3698,0.6379,0.0742,0.0307,5.0535,4.8255,1.0574,1.8247,2.5354,0.3961,3.8298,0.1405,5.2509,3.0244,1.8858,0.2023,0.7898,3.2919,3.3823,1.1732,0.5346,2.8996,2.2294,5.1703,3.7187,2.1462,1.6116,2.7366,2.6871,1.3894,2.0804,2.3943,4.8624,3.9984,2.4228,4.5667,0.0532,1.0039,3.5267,0.623,0.7007,0.0002,5.2957,0.1049,0.0003,0.001]}
{"id":1923,"ended":true,"length":581,"gen_text":"Early fossil remains were fragmentary, which led to much speculation on the posture and nature of Iguanodon. Iguanodon was initially portrayed as a quadrupedal horn @ - @ nosed beast. However, in the latest specimen that has been identified as belonging to Iguanodon species, Iguanodon was described as quadrupedal, although we are not actually sure that's the case.\nAfter initial research into Iguanodon, we now know that the reptile was quite different and thus the overall appearance didn't change much. Its main characteristic was still very similar to that of its foreheads and hind legs. In contrast, the pelage of the two largest extant specimens of Iguanodon is very different from that of the first vertebrate to be described with this description. This suggests that it may have long bones at the tail and a large nose.\nA good comparison to our reptile was found with the fossil specimens of its head and hind legs (the latter showing a long tail and large snout, respectively), not so much so as the size. It probably weighed about 500g.\nThis specimen shows that the jaws of the Iguanodon jaw and the other three vertebrae on its trunk were not present when the large skull was initially taken (we can see from the photo above where they remain), but they did occur. The teeth probably were on the right side of the head, suggesting that they had been broken down during the process of making teeth on the legs.\nEven though there is no evidence that the two large vertebrae that form the backbone of the head are absent from these fossils, this one's jaw-like size suggests that they were present during the first phase of development, and as a result would probably have become extinct during the early stages of this phase.\nThe jaw and hind limbs of Iguanodon are quite similar in appearance, and this may be the first documented specimen of its head. At first glance, the jaw can be clearly seen to feature a small or oval shaped mouth. There is little discernible difference when you look close, as it is slightly flattened or flattened. However, the small mouth at the right of the body on one side (a notch on its cheekline) appears very small. This indicates that Iguanodon was not only a quadrupedal, but one of the largest carnivores in modern times.\nWhat is important is that the jaw has a very small mouth. This is likely an indication that the teeth of the mandible of Iguanodon are not easily broken, since this is how some of the teeth of this dinosaur were made. The mouth must have been present if it had been on the back of a larger prey animal, such as our own. One possibility is that the two teeth were broken down during the course of development, by teeth that had been broken down in the early stages of their evolution, which is also unlikely. Instead, we do not know how the jaw was broken down, and no fossil found of a similar size or form from the Iguanodon was possible to use to illustrate how the jaw is formed.","token_len":643,"entropy":[11.4614,2.6918,3.0292,8.7369,0.0118,1.2729,4.4969,3.4934,0.5176,5.3138,0.8987,3.285,1.0511,10.4195,1.5284,4.9281,0.0054,9.0291,3.9946,1.2055,0.7525,1.1436,4.1863,0.2895,0.0097,0.0124,1.3234,5.9004,6.5853,0.2437,0.7495,5.6085,0.0051,0.154,8.4403,16.169,6.508,7.1188,6.2695,5.8388,11.0999,2.2171,2.4299,0.1644,2.9825,1.513,5.565,4.271,5.1876,2.2259,0.2388,3.2235,2.0173,3.3922,0.0159,1.558,0.0041,0.0016,0.0009,6.6383,0.7864,2.7559,0.009,0.0018,0.0007,1.843,3.5797,0.289,5.8164,0.002,0.0044,2.1665,4.7898,4.1454,2.3125,1.2994,6.1644,1.3107,3.8924,3.9646,1.0325,0.188,0.3376,2.4398,7.64,4.5109,3.3652,2.6504,0.9348,0.0006,0.001,0.0004,0.8716,1.3862,2.1646,0.6539,0.4757,1.7251,5.3829,0.2379,1.0362,4.6588,3.6827,5.0356,5.2628,3.4155,5.3857,3.162,6.7542,0.0005,0.6415,0.9765,0.5946,4.7415,4.6685,2.9486,0.5682,5.8799,4.9898,1.4209,0.1423,1.0829,0.0766,2.8433,4.7407,5.3644,2.0811,2.6283,1.1339,1.1827,3.2405,3.1874,0.7404,1.3737,5.8604,3.4602,1.3783,1.4277,5.1867,5.0016,4.0211,2.0281,2.0464,0.3443,0.0004,0.0008,0.0002,1.992,2.0539,0.7229,1.7232,0.9241,0.0809,1.3054,4.5112,5.3965,0.6453,3.552,1.2176,2.6091,4.0635,1.9791,3.7723,0.4318,2.8779,2.8257,0.2039,2.7486,2.3507,0.1698,6.1507,3.4703,3.7262,0.3443,4.3532,1.4359,2.3774,3.4079,5.3935,1.3356,1.6984,4.3319,5.7158,2.955,2.8228,4.1717,4.8776,0.1201,3.1838,2.0491,3.3264,1.0191,3.482,5.6102,0.7517,6.3468,3.8568,1.7837,1.8455,0.3861,3.2219,3.574,1.6152,3.1741,1.6459,3.4081,1.7583,1.6223,3.1673,5.2919,0.0722,2.7894,2.884,2.338,6.4272,4.9807,0.7608,4.3642,1.0987,1.675,5.4476,2.643,2.9942,5.1813,2.9625,1.7222,4.0716,2.4818,2.1502,1.3329,3.2988,3.2289,3.3524,1.8035,1.3593,4.8415,1.2571,1.4961,1.5539,0.0007,0.0013,0.0007,4.4191,3.9028,1.5163,4.9837,3.6259,2.408,0.4494,0.0217,3.5823,0.904,6.1843,0.9501,2.9546,4.4793,2.8294,1.4827,5.8426,4.1221,0.497,5.3594,4.0864,4.0219,4.4305,2.2144,0.963,2.8898,0.5482,3.5142,1.2717,4.7337,3.0744,5.3277,3.3554,1.5037,2.6672,2.7412,4.5276,2.0573,1.8179,2.9766,6.6326,2.2169,4.6638,0.533,3.9041,0.4838,0.3621,0.2138,2.1752,1.2227,5.3425,0.4123,1.6191,2.7317,0.5944,5.4788,2.4324,3.2733,0.8354,1.8795,0.2915,4.1991,3.885,3.7824,0.5482,5.6849,0.7609,1.1103,5.6364,1.112,3.9577,1.3101,1.2208,1.398,1.1178,1.0446,4.47,2.8815,1.5135,0.0519,0.0088,4.0868,3.427,0.3002,3.7635,0.0637,0.6442,2.6779,2.3781,5.0786,2.0856,2.8313,1.4902,0.1874,2.8434,5.3028,4.5195,2.3094,5.6211,2.2746,5.0441,1.9174,0.3554,1.8293,0.8977,1.9121,2.6175,0.3977,4.2349,3.5235,0.0853,2.3303,2.6548,2.2056,4.7079,1.7027,0.2224,5.2551,3.1172,0.3516,5.4397,0.8831,3.3306,0.462,3.5771,0.9229,0.097,3.8094,4.4328,0.407,0.8287,1.8034,3.1792,2.6855,2.0125,2.7122,1.1716,1.3709,0.0005,0.0006,0.0001,1.5879,3.2209,0.9357,2.6611,1.5133,1.7979,2.1311,3.256,3.7415,1.5536,2.59,2.8041,5.5291,2.156,0.7832,2.577,2.531,1.703,5.3214,2.3914,0.5319,0.6663,1.7167,2.1141,4.9758,0.9375,3.0118,0.1689,1.8723,6.5071,1.3458,3.28,5.7481,4.2577,2.186,3.5608,1.86,4.5319,0.8246,4.0092,5.6894,0.1792,1.5423,5.0699,3.2354,0.6858,4.425,1.2617,2.4331,2.3068,1.0771,4.8194,3.7599,4.2739,2.6475,1.6306,2.3203,0.0394,1.682,3.878,2.5635,4.6148,0.16,4.4517,1.8155,0.1284,3.4391,5.3254,3.9062,0.6526,4.2108,4.0683,5.345,1.6203,2.4425,5.4488,5.5552,0.3441,3.5517,3.5593,2.8276,1.6141,1.9853,2.9421,0.1444,2.7149,0.0004,0.0008,0.0005,1.2086,2.3027,3.4689,1.4067,3.4736,0.001,0.001,1.304,0.1115,4.2154,2.0824,0.8215,1.7447,4.6767,0.5014,2.1168,4.2695,0.5623,0.3022,0.5247,4.8343,2.0384,3.4098,1.4604,0.2617,1.3241,1.5151,3.7682,1.6098,1.7231,2.3144,2.8499,2.065,1.471,1.4409,3.3447,3.9298,0.8924,0.4115,0.9541,2.4705,1.9058,0.913,5.0225,0.8822,3.0692,1.0312,0.0005,0.0007,0.0001,2.7112,2.0092,5.2261,1.4999,2.3373,3.7214,2.5498,1.3642,3.3774,5.2772,1.8433,0.4101,0.3892,1.3799,3.629,3.7014,1.4051,2.6214,0.3761,2.0695,2.9487,5.6675,0.2971,0.3029,5.2941,5.3095,1.7073,1.2491,0.353,4.8381,0.7666,3.8094,0.469,1.6913,5.3183,4.4242,1.4464,1.2735,1.6541,0.006,6.1922,3.2995,2.077,5.7409,2.7737,0.3172,0.0744,0.8952,5.7752,1.525,1.5075,2.7352,1.2663,0.7134,0.5757,4.854,0.0038,1.0625,0.7323,5.2065,5.939,2.2881,2.2913,0.7534,1.6889,0.2564,2.5883,0.9276,3.7504,0.1535,0.186,4.1111,2.3592,1.7782,2.8007,2.131,3.2131,5.1172,0.4313,6.1864,0.1362,2.4459,3.7229,0.793,0.5036,2.5754,1.8716,1.4501,1.5604,1.8193,0.103,1.4883,1.5553,5.3071,3.3853,5.4628,2.2438,3.5241,3.3431,1.0346,2.7096,4.4599,5.5223,1.6969,2.5317,0.0011,0.0013,0.0013,3.7285,4.7796,1.6412,4.2709,1.3004,4.9167,3.2474,1.5172,0.6926,3.4717,2.127,0.4095]}
{"id":3557,"ended":false,"length":617,"gen_text":"There are certain jobs that horses do very well, and no technology has yet developed to fully replace them. For example, mounted police horses are still effective for certain types of patrol work where they tend to perform the role of backup vehicle, protecting the public from dangerous situations because of the risk of injury from a collision or car crash.\n\nAn interesting finding about horses is that as horses age, they quickly die out. In most cases, they become frail before they reach their 80s or 90s. This is a very good thing for horses, especially because that's how veterinarians determine the age of their horses after being properly trained. So what has changed with this age of horses is that they become less able to manage their body's stress. If a horse is going to take a long vacation or long walk at some point, it takes more effort to care for the horses in the long run than with the less active horses, which means that horse owners must focus on the long run instead of the short term, meaning that the longer you have the better.\n\nHowever, some of the other factors that keep horses from doing well in life in any age include their age, their weight and their temperament. They may not know what they are doing or what they are doing very well, but they probably want to help out. And some research has revealed that most (85%) of the horse owners who will give up on a horse are just interested in the horses, and they simply don't know what life's the same at any age in their lives, even at 78 as they are. That's a huge disappointment, but it's a huge advantage to a horse that you're able to give it your best shot, and a big reason not to euthanize a horse in the first place.\n\nOf course horses don't always run all their life long, but horses do sometimes live a short time (as in an extremely short time in most cases ), so that's why it's important to let them take their rest after being sick or injured. If you plan to take them off their hind legs immediately, leave them at home or stay away from your car, it's your responsibility to take them home before they get too tired.\n\nSo What Are Horses Worth?\n\nTo help you understand this important topic properly, I found this report from a book written by one of the world's leading horse owners and published in 2007, on the subject of horses that are truly worth your time.\n\nIf you are unable to book a horse for sale and, like most people, would like to see a horse in your life that can live and live. Do you have your horse that you would really consider a great value, to take home for you after being sick or injured? Do you enjoy all of these rides? Do you like riding? Do you like your horse on your daily rides? Does your horse enjoy being used by others?

{"id":2237,"ended":true,"length":582,"gen_text":"The costume designer for Sense and Sensibility was Michele Clapton. She and assistant costume designer Alex Fordham undertook a large amount of research looking for inspiration. They spent hours looking at paintings and drawing backgrounds and creating a design for the cover of the first issue. The costumes worked for ten weeks. In November 1989, Clapton and Fordham opened a new gallery in their office, a replica of the classic showroom used for years after the show was shut down.\n\nThe book is the book.\n\nIt is a very good book. It is a very honest and thorough story, and the authors do not shy away from revealing some of the secrets of their industry. There are a ton of anecdotes, stories and experiences for each character, as well as some amusing anecdotes about some of their colleagues and their experiences as characters. Clapton, Fordham and Claspar are both extremely smart, experienced and extremely hard working. In addition to being incredibly talented and smart, and working with great craft, it is a real pleasure to work with them everyday.\n\nThe book is a very valuable book, if you want good stories, good characters and great writing.\n\nIf you're not into the magic stuff, Clapton, Fordham and Claspar are very good at it. The story they tell through the characters and the book, which is so important to them, is important to these young people. This is why we were able to go forward and provide them with something really special and amazing and so they can read this stuff. They could never believe what they had to read out loud.\n\nThe book will come out at least next year. And when you buy it, you get to read it as a part of the ongoing series on our Facebook page. It will also be on your favorite social media sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, IHeartRadio, Stitcher and many more.\n\nThe book will be released at the beginning of this year by Clapton, Fordham and Claspar and will also be released at the end of this year, by Claspar and Claspar. If you want, you can get the book at www.claptonforsale.com, or by calling 800-344-0123, on Facebook, Twitter or on Instagram.

{"id":3981,"ended":false,"length":549,"gen_text":"The USS Butler ( DD @ - @ 636 ), a Gleaves @ - @ class destroyer, was named in his honor in 1942. This vessel participated in the European and Pacific Fleet naval contest in 1939 in the Atlantic Ocean. Her primary purpose was to provide support for ships in the United States' naval defense against attack and disaster.\n\nAncariya, a new class of German torpedo submarines, was part of the original Italian class during World War II after coming to Italy from Italy.\n\nThe German designation of Anacariya is based on the Greek verb Anakis, or \"to throw.\" As we shall see above, the name was borne by most of the German torpedo boats during the war. It was also borne by both Russian and Japanese torpedo boats, which were called Anakis by some. As a result, the name Anacarya is probably borne by some of the torpedo boats. In recent years, the Germans have begun considering the new name Anacariya, as well as the name Anacaras.\n\nAnacaras are a Russian classification of a class of German torpedo submarine. The Russian designation of Anakas is based on the Greek verb, Anacharas, or \"to throw.\" As we shall see above, the name was borne by most of the Russian torpedo boats during the war. It was also borne by both Russian and Japanese torpedo boats, which were called Anacaras by some. As a result, the name is probably borne by some of the torpedo boats. In recent years, the Germans have begun considering the new name Anacaras, as well as the name Anacaras.\n\nAerons have a different name for the submarines, but are still in effect in this part of Europe. See U. PNAS Article 5.\n\nThe name of Aeron is borrowed from the word aeris by the Russian military authorities.\n\nAeron\n\nRussia (\u0412\u0438\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f, Russian Ancyan) was a naval power located in the Red Sea near Russia in the 13th century, about 250 kms from today's Russian coast. It made numerous military and commercial contacts with the rest of Russia. The name Aeron comes from a Latin word meaning \"the star\" or \"the point.\" That is, \"this is the ocean.\" The name Aerony has the same Germanic and Greek root as its Russian namesake, Aeros. Aeron's early nickname was Anar. This name derives from the Greek verb Aeryum, or to throw.\n\nAnaeron was a Russian submarine unit that was called the Nihonka, or nautical police. One of the nautical police was the Oleska, or \"new navy.\"\n\nThe name Aeron means \"in the midst of the sea.\"\n\nThe name was also used by the Germans to refer to the new class of Russian torpedo boats. It usually means \"to sink.\"\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nNaval News Service (NMS), 15-16 September 2013\n\nEnergetic News (ENR), 12-13 December 2012","token_len":650,"entropy":[10.8356,9.3265,2.0876,12.737,9.4256,7.2914,6.2063,5.6238,5.9303,7.6589,2.0972,13.1452,7.8406,10.1855,1.4644,0.5491,12.2565,3.0507,0.6981,1.179,6.4154,2.5952,6.1945,0.113,2.6991,4.2302,0.4366,3.8961,3.0174,6.5428,0.0443,0.7033,7.1447,3.2315,1.2207,3.261,6.3094,6.0691,1.9409,4.788,4.4839,1.2752,4.0128,1.7809,0.6012,3.8326,5.2086,2.9313,0.1417,0.2597,2.7602,3.1963,0.9372,5.6304,1.9564,0.7421,4.8922,0.1177,4.2764,3.0488,3.4218,2.3695,4.1821,2.4379,5.7915,0.5763,2.0451,0.0158,5.8737,5.518,7.1977,4.823,2.7266,2.4571,5.0001,1.2687,0.7609,5.57,4.4302,4.5324,0.7089,0.8553,5.8391,0.0054,0.2443,5.2636,5.2956,2.0053,5.0164,0.7767,0.0008,0.1091,5.8209,6.7262,1.5715,2.6245,1.2142,2.8033,1.1199,2.4317,0.0004,1.8777,3.9148,4.4716,1.2613,2.0476,3.5295,0.0733,0.0045,2.377,2.1191,0.1196,0.6306,3.9792,5.8667,2.6544,8.0031,1.2365,3.7511,1.0009,1.0504,5.606,2.0804,4.6213,5.6047,2.5816,0.1151,4.8814,0.082,1.2642,2.5727,2.2954,4.9675,0.8362,4.7728,0.778,0.1672,1.897,2.9974,2.2046,3.065,1.0873,1.3621,0.7486,3.7319,1.0008,1.8047,1.1024,0.0674,5.0435,5.4124,0.285,2.1353,0.5454,0.3588,1.9507,2.2138,1.1193,3.5109,1.019,5.1164,3.1082,2.943,1.578,4.1626,2.1753,0.6794,0.267,1.0115,0.8137,1.1331,0.1977,6.1336,2.2637,4.9342,4.242,0.3251,3.4876,0.7856,0.1816,2.0464,0.4361,1.8176,3.1623,5.939,0.3653,0.3099,1.527,4.943,0.4914,3.2718,6.409,1.255,4.7259,1.5014,0.6164,0.3321,1.1009,0.0489,1.8772,2.2091,2.0042,0.2175,1.2266,1.5354,0.7429,0.4837,2.5397,2.825,1.6584,0.7592,0.0003,2.4394,0.1099,1.2517,0.1039,2.9983,2.5644,4.7989,6.4501,0.2976,2.7869,2.6359,0.073,2.1732,0.6081,3.407,1.3041,1.6943,3.6917,1.4545,1.3713,0.5814,4.7921,2.6704,0.936,1.8134,0.0683,0.1692,0.5585,0.5308,4.0933,0.475,4.4738,1.9697,0.5213,0.6329,1.318,0.0981,0.1126,0.4844,0.1539,0.7687,0.3222,0.0614,0.0148,0.1011,0.0037,0.0343,0.0242,0.5716,0.0336,0.0023,0.0477,0.0038,0.0022,2.1995,0.0141,0.0598,0.0096,0.0035,0.0038,0.0351,0.2865,0.0108,0.0029,0.0034,0.0018,0.0171,0.0165,0.0009,0.0029,0.0008,0.0053,0.0114,0.0038,0.0088,0.0074,0.0602,3.0894,0.4194,0.0119,0.0064,0.0025,0.0045,0.1564,0.0044,0.0025,0.0003,0.0013,0.0053,2.3928,0.0353,0.005,0.0043,0.13,0.0008,0.001,0.0037,0.0088,0.0014,0.0579,0.0003,0.0019,0.0006,0.0022,0.0208,0.0019,0.0125,0.0064,0.0019,0.0067,0.0038,0.1231,0.1096,0.1879,0.0275,0.1176,0.0032,0.0034,0.0009,0.0022,0.0029,0.0241,0.0768,0.0578,0.0704,0.0634,0.6063,0.0001,2.7479,5.0568,5.1941,4.8354,2.4023,3.4362,1.7085,1.1179,1.5992,4.7959,2.3108,2.7501,2.7901,2.7799,4.7273,6.0687,3.2238,5.3166,4.0553,0.0159,2.9547,0.3613,6.1077,6.0341,0.6253,10.9943,6.5765,4.0671,4.1509,1.9977,1.8084,0.0002,1.9651,2.0551,2.4686,6.9114,0.9171,1.5204,4.9622,0.0938,0.6144,4.429,2.4171,4.3219,3.9313,1.6133,3.9149,4.8047,3.3419,0.9967,1.9323,0.0002,1.9657,0.2099,0.8353,4.6345,0.0002,5.7839,4.0252,2.7505,2.5036,1.8668,5.088,2.4956,2.0765,0.6639,1.9446,1.3112,2.4082,2.1604,0.2109,2.9472,4.3079,5.6551,6.1198,2.561,1.23,2.563,1.1344,4.1354,0.6907,4.2102,0.6241,0.4368,5.4831,0.1119,4.4671,3.457,3.1777,0.4738,5.4011,0.0472,0.2234,2.8134,3.1597,4.3456,3.5551,0.06,1.9008,5.7197,0.1334,4.1702,2.4454,0.2694,1.4381,5.9199,5.1135,4.2626,1.7275,2.402,4.3979,0.6206,0.9255,3.9609,0.0015,2.442,1.432,2.0231,3.064,0.4752,0.0736,3.7898,0.0208,2.9762,3.7556,0.6317,1.007,0.2478,3.9609,5.1612,1.7309,0.7709,0.1944,0.9033,6.0755,1.2732,6.6346,1.1301,0.498,2.467,5.6744,1.3574,0.8337,5.8906,0.8519,1.7959,0.9213,0.6742,6.4385,4.8639,3.2984,1.0694,4.674,0.8321,2.7951,1.9758,2.0738,0.7007,3.3435,1.3071,4.9421,1.0535,1.1407,3.6279,0.6456,2.216,0.5693,3.0096,5.3065,4.999,0.8115,3.9632,4.1705,2.6891,4.4094,0.8835,3.6638,0.0627,0.4165,1.3637,2.5978,4.092,4.0904,5.7629,0.4888,1.0531,3.4729,0.5443,0.5978,1.0583,0.0002,2.4409,3.2774,0.6919,1.14,1.6103,2.6802,2.381,5.7733,2.1131,1.5183,4.154,1.8605,5.4655,5.2947,0.8537,4.9625,1.9516,0.9046,5.6208,3.0652,5.6677,0.9364,5.2279,0.2291,0.4722,3.8912,0.0192,0.5836,0.7677,1.7624,5.358,5.1504,1.913,0.613,0.6145,2.7044,5.6638,3.7489,0.5925,2.0161,0.0002,1.5346,1.033,0.9935,0.2753,3.9634,0.3451,5.0367,1.4225,4.3293,0.2202,1.2668,0.7251,0.6724,1.5821,0.0002,1.5772,0.7222,3.8638,2.5248,1.4172,1.2712,0.6661,2.9453,1.6515,1.0973,0.0065,1.2429,6.008,1.6523,0.0732,2.5123,0.8004,0.7795,0.9203,3.195,6.624,1.9116,0.2405,2.5116,1.9757,0.9913,0.7425,0.0002,6.3281,2.559,0.0013,0.0026,0.8246,0.0003,4.7221,2.4252,3.762,1.2102,2.2212,2.247,4.5073,1.4219,5.4694,4.7703,1.5532,2.5622,5.3776,2.3036,0.0002,5.4938,4.7902,2.0635,2.7069,2.2291,3.7691,3.7276,0.2723,3.6173,0.7378,0.9339,2.6757,1.7172]}
{"id":4154,"ended":false,"length":588,"gen_text":"The charter unit within Air Greenland is led by Hans Peter Hansen and employs 8 people, with 13 helicopters and 3 fixed @ - @ wing aircraft at its disposal. Excess capacity of the 'N' aircraft are found below:\n\n\nIt goes without saying that the lack of sufficient training and equipment has been a top concern across the aircraft.\n\nAir Greenland currently has about 12 000 regular and scheduled flight hours with about 15 days training and training scheduled daily.\n\nAir Greenland is currently planning to have up to 70 per cent more air time at regular airtime from 5-8pm.\n\nA number of the major companies involved will have two hours daily with more available to the pilot and crew on Tuesday or Wednesday for training\/flight updates.\n\nThe aircraft also has flight crew and maintenance staff on site at the same time to provide more training during the week.\n\nOne-in-10 pilots will start taking flight training soon, while the rest, who are working full-time, will be given to go in a short period of time.\n\nHowever, some of the pilots won't go overnight because of the ongoing safety issues.\n\nAir Greenland pilots will continue working as on-site crew to ensure they are fully fit for duty when they are not. They will also be asked to sign one hour of written test pilots licences which will then be posted at the start of practice.\n\nThe pilots will be required to wear helmets when flying and provide adequate training when training under supervision.\n\nThe current training cycle has been disrupted following an incident as flight training equipment went out of stock.\n\n\nAir Greenland's previous pilot-driven aircraft were used as an option to fly with the aircraft, then as a training module using its unique autopilot and control system.\n\nBut with increasing demand and the need to run all their pilots in a similar environment, Air Greenland's pilots are now being moved to a different equipment.\n\n\nIt is thought those pilots will be handed the gear which incorporates the current autopilot.\n\n\nIt also plans to incorporate it into the aircraft's maintenance system during training which could bring an increased cost saving over time, it was revealed earlier on Thursday.\n\n\nThe pilot gear would then be used to train any pilots with the new autopilot which has been built by Air Greenland.\n\n\"This new equipment uses the autopilot with the same capabilities that had already been installed in our primary equipment, now we will be looking to expand our aircraft with higher performance over time,\" said Hans Peter Hansen, head of Air Greenland's operations.\n\n\n\"So it is not a short-term solution - it is a long-term solution,\" he added.\n\nBut it is expected to take at least two years before Air Greenland has a final design, complete with wings, landing gear, landing gear and the full system of control, and finalised for the next generation of aircrew.\n\n\n\"I would ask that the team develop new features, new technology and better gear for each aircrew to enable the pilot to do better,\" he said. \"The pilot training in Greenland is also about as safe as flying in the national airspace.\" (With file from The

{"id":3446,"ended":false,"length":535,"gen_text":"Below are lists selected by notable committees prior to the season that represent what they anticipate to be the most likely candidates to be recognized at the end of the season for their specific awards.\n\nBelow, are the top five nominees for the B.C. Premier Hockey Performance Award. In all cases, nominees were selected based on their high-profile experience in the league, their ability to perform at competitive levels, and their ability to make significant contributions to the game after coming to the league during a rough year in the playoffs.\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nJohn Tortorella (Florida)\n\nIn the past 10 seasons, Tortorella has been one of Canada's most consistent scorers. His 15th career playoff appearance is the second with a 4.01 GAA, followed by Mike Hoffman (7.20 GAA) and Matt Dumba (7.29 GAA).\n\nFor an article on Tortorella's hockey career, check out the full list below. As part of our research, we created an online database to track all top ten scores during the 2015-16 season. This database uses the most recent season of the B.C. Professional Hockey Player Awards (2015-16) to create awards for all seven categories (including goals, assists, points, penalties, turnover and penalty minutes).\n\nThe categories for the 2015-16 National Hockey League Player Awards were determined by Hockey Canada, with the 2015-16 National Player of the Year winner being the Canadian junior team that had the best record in the Eastern Conference at the end of the 2015 playoffs. The top 20 goals were awarded to the team with the most offensive points in the division.\n\nThe top three goals went to goaltender Connor McDavid (7.22 GAA), who had the league's second-best goal-to-against in the division. McDavid has since lost that season to the Buffalo Sabres.\n\nThe top goal-to-start penalty-scorer (2.99 GAA) is Mark Scheifele (1.70 GAA).\n\nThe top three penalty-scorer (2.99 GAA) is Brandon Sutter (2.75 GAA).\n\nThe top goal-scorer (2.99 GAA) is Jamie Benn (2.86 GAA).\n\nThe top three penalty-scorer (3.18 GAA) is Travis Konecny (2.57 GAA).\n\nThe top five goals in each category were awarded by the head coach who, in total, had the top scoring year for this award since 2006.\n\nIf you are seeing a player who is on that list, please note that this does not take our list down to the top 100. We believe players should be rewarded appropriately based on their performance throughout the season. It is your decision on who receives the most recognition in the voting. A successful season can't come at a disadvantage for a player, but we will still consider a player deserving of a lot more time in the league by doing our best to honor him or her.\n\nFor more about NHL Draft Scouting, click here.\n\n[poll id=\"1238\u2033]","token_len":651,"entropy":[4.9838,8.8379,10.3307,1.0287,9.5752,7.8973,8.9749,0.0067,0.9856,7.5677,3.5138,4.8273,5.5501,2.3967,8.8534,1.6211,0.1079,1.2798,1.3261,4.731,2.623,0.9743,1.8791,7.4081,3.3467,0.3859,2.8676,0.0028,0.2742,0.6887,3.6178,3.7086,6.3612,4.0395,0.4357,0.9593,0.0002,4.9324,2.7681,4.2999,0.9059,2.492,2.1001,1.5327,0.9233,1.0376,5.7686,2.6503,0.6595,0.03,4.218,3.8507,7.231,0.5318,1.3495,5.0283,4.2173,1.6417,0.1445,4.1017,2.1763,0.9438,0.9815,0.1103,0.8176,5.6462,1.8711,1.9598,5.2176,2.1346,0.6343,2.53,1.5253,1.9006,2.428,0.0385,2.9893,1.3488,5.4271,0.2766,0.8288,0.6178,0.5406,1.5899,0.0254,3.7764,2.8907,0.2815,0.374,0.3013,2.2427,7.2267,5.0855,0.941,0.9232,2.2347,5.5161,1.4638,4.8425,2.9766,3.036,1.4271,3.44,0.0896,0.4942,0.0002,4.0773,0.4581,1.0701,0.0,1.0128,0.0001,4.8878,4.5307,0.0009,0.0,1.8945,4.5812,2.4371,0.7569,0.0002,4.2711,2.2397,2.4617,3.9515,0.7358,0.159,0.8961,0.0017,0.0038,0.2401,1.8968,3.4203,0.007,4.9798,0.0052,1.2748,1.6876,2.2351,0.0034,1.2581,2.7382,4.6474,5.3821,2.2226,1.5212,0.5447,2.8028,1.5886,2.3452,6.8939,2.4794,4.3331,0.8967,4.3167,0.6798,0.0014,1.2213,5.2576,0.1042,4.9051,1.6644,0.7985,3.5702,0.5048,4.6974,1.1241,0.0096,1.4458,0.3442,4.4965,3.2846,0.0095,0.0688,1.0398,0.0012,4.4823,0.1746,0.0017,0.2547,1.6209,0.0002,5.0838,4.4144,4.9247,1.1846,1.108,0.0029,0.0064,0.4327,5.4745,0.9216,0.4784,1.5823,0.0392,1.7654,3.4867,1.4694,1.9218,0.3507,6.528,4.4049,0.0007,2.0826,5.129,0.9245,0.2719,4.44,2.771,3.0487,1.8433,2.1954,2.2406,2.5534,5.2123,3.4618,3.5914,4.4034,0.8855,2.8934,0.1238,0.1657,0.5025,0.6049,3.5672,1.3093,5.1918,1.849,2.8613,0.34,3.1469,2.7578,1.4387,3.5996,0.0063,0.0013,0.0045,2.8921,0.1426,3.9012,2.9268,2.3063,3.3328,0.1524,0.0615,0.8996,0.8854,3.1656,5.3176,0.9292,2.3512,4.3298,1.3028,3.7318,3.9565,3.3121,0.3425,0.3811,0.0754,0.9389,0.2416,3.6883,0.2835,6.399,1.8697,2.8133,1.388,0.4743,0.6828,0.0001,2.5062,5.4741,3.1912,1.5942,2.0515,0.0162,0.0155,6.0579,0.6699,0.0311,1.3364,0.3514,2.1773,4.9914,0.7114,4.5312,1.5911,1.8863,3.209,0.9817,5.5159,0.1789,0.0073,1.1984,2.1232,0.252,0.0037,0.0139,4.625,1.3108,2.8254,4.6672,4.4164,1.8518,2.9633,3.7756,0.5524,1.2687,0.8794,1.0405,0.2972,5.8276,0.0311,3.4051,0.7323,1.8392,0.0012,0.2073,2.3547,4.9341,0.2028,1.6861,2.5172,4.1102,3.8216,3.0915,2.6871,0.7514,0.7397,1.8839,1.1683,0.0347,1.116,6.2938,1.7939,1.8261,0.193,3.2967,1.2443,0.7784,0.0002,1.545,1.5253,3.1224,0.8499,7.1366,0.0594,4.3163,4.4397,0.602,0.0003,1.0715,3.0337,0.2089,4.3756,0.0954,0.0025,0.7239,2.4674,1.5109,1.1409,3.3278,0.2147,2.1815,0.2175,0.5211,2.9442,1.2328,0.9955,0.0015,3.2072,5.1221,0.839,1.6487,1.193,1.6886,0.0008,2.7385,4.4707,4.9912,3.9553,3.1856,1.2385,3.3215,3.9354,0.0009,1.059,0.5329,0.0002,1.2872,0.9743,2.71,0.8568,0.6749,0.0007,6.5374,5.363,1.2579,4.3692,0.0534,3.4385,4.2701,0.144,4.5181,0.1143,0.0016,0.208,3.4353,5.0804,2.5,0.0001,0.0,0.3544,2.6608,0.0011,4.6808,0.0187,0.0013,0.7242,1.0948,0.0003,0.7253,0.552,2.109,1.1408,0.5831,0.5051,0.0844,1.2847,1.268,0.0034,0.7172,0.0108,0.0013,0.0218,1.0517,5.3279,2.4188,0.0015,0.0266,2.0341,0.0005,4.0693,0.003,0.0013,0.3736,0.1095,0.0003,0.439,0.2613,3.5424,0.3745,0.4824,0.0031,0.3596,0.2107,0.0005,0.0926,0.0021,0.0016,0.0166,0.0685,4.9349,0.5688,0.0073,0.5898,0.0004,4.1614,0.0024,0.0014,0.1395,0.0774,0.0003,0.4205,0.2403,1.4213,0.354,0.0346,0.16,0.0085,0.1456,2.6047,0.0009,4.6383,0.0116,0.0018,0.018,0.1413,5.1761,1.4757,0.0022,0.0003,0.0,0.0029,1.0468,0.0003,4.6305,0.0018,0.0015,0.1055,0.0599,0.0003,0.4374,0.179,3.4683,1.3701,2.8738,2.52,0.3253,1.2218,1.1296,1.7586,0.9269,5.0637,0.2992,4.3778,5.2338,1.8747,2.8985,0.0263,1.7717,0.7045,3.5865,3.4402,4.3262,2.2267,5.2327,3.3467,4.8389,3.3228,1.2434,0.5596,0.0002,5.3224,0.5401,2.8208,6.118,2.3872,3.3755,2.1275,1.6891,4.3409,4.4925,0.0591,0.4529,0.601,4.2152,0.3232,2.8713,4.2,0.0525,4.2329,8.3969,3.4164,5.0015,0.4378,0.5467,1.1347,3.1451,1.7103,2.0698,4.9499,4.1252,2.6202,0.7264,2.9299,4.6575,1.5805,0.0697,0.3975,1.4957,3.9936,0.313,0.4423,0.4727,4.4088,0.513,4.4593,2.3877,4.0068,1.6555,3.2285,0.5166,1.4163,1.6353,2.7974,0.9913,3.69,0.9543,6.1397,6.1544,2.1315,2.289,3.9928,2.977,0.2757,0.4179,4.1195,1.4333,1.5358,0.4236,1.9353,1.0744,3.0142,2.981,3.7899,2.0581,3.0354,0.1774,4.6416,0.366,1.9195,4.5376,1.3214,4.9031,2.0228,0.253,2.1956,5.6563,4.0152,1.2655,0.5028,0.0836,3.0213,2.8672,2.5348,0.0438,0.4118,0.4563,0.0002,3.3999,0.5506,3.8253,4.4658,4.1143,3.1167,0.3567,2.3134,0.0402,0.1981,0.8319,0.0003,4.6104,4.1568,0.171,0.1131,3.7758,4.9669,1.0333,0.2843]}

Two of the soldiers of the armed forces, Artyomichi Chiiros and Misa, arrive on the scene to protect the residents from a mass shooting by the government. Their plan is to assassinate the police chief, who then attempts to strike down the government with an assassination attempt. The group is saved by Ochoa Todoroki and his team, but are overwhelmed by the army's high level of attack.

{"id":4358,"ended":false,"length":604,"gen_text":"A key thrust of Malaysia's case was that the British had received explicit permission from Johor to build a lighthouse on Pedra Branca, which proved that the British had recognised Johor's sovereignty and would have been reluctant in accepting the new building.[4] The British denied this request because of the secrecy around the negotiations.[5] After the Dutch referendum, the British also moved to create a Dutch-Malaysian joint settlement that required the British to acknowledge the British's treaty rights and its rights of sovereignty.\n\nIt is reported that in early November 2011, Johor granted the Government of Malaysia's request for exclusive rights to build a lighthouse. On 11 December, Malaysia had requested to build a lighthouse with a maximum distance between five kilometers and 13 kilometers but Malaysia would be required to build at least 75 kilometres.[6] At the same time, the British promised Johor a 20,000 tonne seaplane with 20,000 tons of natural gas.[7]\n\nIn late 2011, Malaysia said they had received a letter from the British requesting access to the island but denied this. Malaysian officials also claimed that the British requested a 50,000 tonne naval jet with 30,000 tons of natural gas on board. Malaysian sources told journalists that the British believed that when they got to the island, they had asked for more land.\n\nIn November, the Department of Industry, Trade and Industry said Malaysia would be required to build a bridge between the islands without any sea traffic on the island. However, Malaysia's main business had remained in Singapore and most of its exports had ended up in Malaysia.\n\nIn late 2012, Malaysia refused to build a road and airport on the Cayman Islands; it did not give specific details about the route. In early 2013, Malaysia finally decided to build this part of the island at the beginning of the year and in the middle of the summer of that year, on March 12, 2014, the final project was completed. The project was called for in the press briefing on Mar 7. The project was called for for the first time with the completion of the land bridge, an island for which Johor had been promised permission; at the same time Malaysia requested a road and airport on the Cayman Islands.\n\nThe project was named after Johor's father and as part of the project was named in honour of his late father and he is recognised by the Malaysian authorities for his contribution to his country's defence, military and law enforcement activities.\n\nAfter Brunei's first independence referendum, the Dutch government promised to build, build and protect the island but was forced to withdraw in July 2014. The Dutch Government then said that if it could not support the project, and if it could not secure full development for the island, then the project would not be funded. After Brunei's second election last May 2014, the Dutch government refused to support the project; in November 2014, Malaysia was also forced to withdraw a $5m loan, with Malaysia paying about $3m in a total of about $2.9m by the end of the year.[8]\n\nUnderlines\n\nAn English-language version of this article appeared (in English in 2002)\n\nNotes","token_len":652,"entropy":[8.0793,8.7237,0.5863,10.4242,0.1644,5.2853,2.3677,1.3814,1.4548,7.2391,2.5444,5.7604,6.0723,1.7617,0.6987,11.4832,0.3013,0.5841,4.0033,1.0619,6.5765,1.9649,11.467,2.3398,8.6873,2.9283,1.5527,2.2994,6.9242,3.4106,1.1287,2.6436,0.6898,6.9003,4.8695,0.0011,0.2733,3.9802,2.1047,3.6191,1.6329,1.9986,5.045,5.5594,4.0335,1.5548,5.2852,3.8447,5.3951,3.8362,0.0757,2.3107,1.8167,5.3608,1.5983,2.7859,4.2934,2.3136,1.0434,5.8352,3.1816,0.5815,5.8537,2.1179,0.4073,0.0551,5.2541,1.0984,4.1914,4.5044,1.1924,1.2157,0.8984,4.0648,5.3398,0.476,4.8058,0.5107,4.0282,2.0426,4.5471,0.1571,0.0216,3.2434,5.7784,4.1737,5.5005,1.3783,2.0229,0.205,4.5398,1.4992,2.9395,0.7484,5.0033,0.9367,2.2352,5.1914,3.3831,2.8868,2.2387,1.5657,1.7621,0.0003,4.4715,1.0682,5.583,0.1737,2.5369,3.1633,3.5517,3.9221,0.4556,2.4736,0.0014,4.2559,1.5451,6.7112,0.9333,0.4431,2.5676,0.5701,0.5792,6.3459,2.4461,0.4672,0.718,0.7248,0.6503,2.8871,3.3746,3.2591,2.1146,1.7296,2.7196,4.6617,3.8174,3.0489,1.117,0.7114,0.7024,3.7807,1.4727,3.4474,5.0838,3.917,4.3762,3.0613,0.2919,5.1098,0.6353,4.4792,2.4231,4.5313,3.6447,1.5454,0.0381,1.7003,3.3854,0.0573,6.1385,2.4558,3.0353,0.0681,0.0488,4.2973,0.7213,1.3415,0.0179,0.1303,1.1497,1.1189,5.2141,3.3616,0.0006,2.9518,4.9885,2.5365,0.0257,1.5888,0.1429,4.7744,2.7505,3.6695,4.8574,1.1583,0.0378,1.6748,0.2151,5.3764,0.2503,2.0522,0.0442,0.0324,1.3799,0.0001,2.1025,2.7529,2.2049,0.2391,1.9705,5.1455,4.1982,1.6701,2.2228,1.6328,2.4078,0.2743,0.8998,0.7361,2.5331,2.5686,0.0566,0.9414,1.993,3.774,3.9281,2.3968,1.6302,4.3799,1.2722,3.0389,2.537,0.6728,1.0991,0.7397,4.5575,2.8359,4.72,0.4773,0.0062,0.0568,0.0032,3.2625,5.9426,1.7564,3.503,0.144,0.0113,0.1254,0.0488,0.3126,0.0018,4.6075,0.9445,1.5731,3.2567,3.8568,3.2162,5.3615,0.3962,1.0297,1.1625,5.2581,0.9148,6.1263,1.8299,4.1676,1.633,0.9585,0.3336,0.9327,0.8687,2.5432,4.4712,1.2121,3.6735,3.4269,2.2136,2.0073,0.0001,1.7558,3.406,2.6571,1.7509,5.935,0.0612,4.8655,2.4615,1.459,0.1799,1.5174,3.1972,3.1525,1.7698,1.6661,1.0308,0.0273,0.985,0.9118,4.9118,2.4735,1.1297,2.1926,5.6509,2.6469,5.5636,3.2274,3.3552,0.7588,1.2929,0.8759,3.0669,0.0345,1.6828,1.8748,4.9378,5.1583,3.8972,5.4741,2.0184,2.6681,1.3895,5.7321,0.5157,1.3212,3.0332,2.0933,3.8749,2.5684,0.4053,0.8219,0.7015,1.5917,0.0001,1.5998,2.5058,1.2693,0.1799,1.1177,5.3063,0.2528,1.7079,0.5881,4.6151,4.0788,4.1675,1.6177,0.3643,7.0719,0.3391,0.1001,5.8307,2.4819,3.0582,1.0431,4.2586,5.6598,1.3976,1.1007,1.3441,3.0406,1.9685,1.8585,2.3492,0.3162,0.0955,1.0059,4.8296,3.619,0.2342,0.472,6.3178,4.7323,0.0217,0.2639,0.7191,5.2967,1.842,4.2607,0.017,1.7324,0.4343,2.2043,3.0152,2.789,2.2696,0.0054,1.1375,1.9718,0.8518,2.2216,0.0077,0.8373,4.3165,5.6415,3.3686,0.3835,1.5893,0.1956,1.3107,5.8665,3.9078,1.0777,1.0277,0.7318,1.9521,2.1422,1.0356,2.9498,4.7669,2.1173,2.3218,4.943,4.1851,2.1767,5.0978,3.3636,1.9999,2.387,1.9301,1.0192,3.5595,0.6344,3.8175,1.4227,1.6335,0.2151,4.8345,1.4501,4.1653,0.3646,0.9948,4.9166,1.3725,2.9611,4.8175,4.382,4.4094,2.1345,4.0462,0.0009,0.9594,2.4652,4.0404,3.7812,6.2309,4.8537,0.6021,1.4092,0.0049,4.1332,3.98,2.3357,4.6892,0.8334,0.3662,1.7928,0.3121,1.9608,0.0132,0.3839,0.7781,0.8312,0.0001,2.0399,2.2378,0.7229,3.7998,2.1919,2.6967,0.0039,1.049,2.3435,2.7707,4.748,2.7563,0.0011,0.7894,3.0475,3.4777,1.4761,4.2553,1.3888,0.0133,1.3599,2.972,0.3279,2.974,4.9653,2.9024,5.1191,1.2979,0.9745,2.1131,3.5444,2.3171,0.5208,3.3279,0.3788,5.9007,0.3673,0.9832,3.6172,2.8602,3.4181,0.2864,4.4781,0.209,3.2381,0.5566,0.6772,0.0001,4.7658,6.3693,0.0041,2.3047,4.9014,3.4379,1.1664,1.3193,1.3206,3.8221,1.8928,5.2315,0.5799,0.9632,6.7207,3.4968,0.1911,4.0279,0.5703,1.5415,3.5388,3.7661,3.6488,0.123,2.8594,3.1935,3.3681,1.2493,1.4313,1.7859,1.4313,3.6912,2.9515,4.0425,1.1063,3.4577,1.611,3.5871,1.0986,4.9132,0.4779,0.9417,0.578,5.6969,1.3596,0.9175,1.1937,0.1445,4.8362,5.8635,4.4107,3.7822,0.2753,0.5484,0.3905,1.5772,1.8585,1.4966,0.7246,2.0587,0.5543,4.2621,0.5843,4.4024,2.7156,0.0143,0.6255,2.1308,4.7552,4.238,2.9723,2.7825,0.0764,0.6845,0.5872,1.17,4.1828,0.0494,1.6449,0.2143,0.1731,4.7829,2.4719,2.9724,0.7788,0.1996,2.5484,3.7037,3.8483,1.8448,0.0215,0.923,4.462,4.0743,3.0987,4.0927,2.1081,3.5122,3.8313,3.5519,3.1061,3.629,0.3805,2.6609,0.7185,1.698,5.1792,3.0957,0.7065,2.0028,0.0426,2.7675,0.8988,3.2039,0.4097,6.0481,1.2342,1.0117,0.0024,1.3502,0.1305,0.9839,0.0329,0.058,0.3722,0.0001,5.7294,5.8997,0.6031,0.0002,5.1555,4.9651,2.529,0.1792,1.665,0.0524,0.2477,0.1668,2.4064,8.0255,2.6453,1.6867,4.0738,5.2281,0.8463,5.2816,0.0002,3.3719]}
{"id":200,"ended":false,"length":624,"gen_text":"Anderson frequently collaborates with many actors and crew, carrying them over from film to film. Anderson has referred to his regular actors as `` my little rep company `` that has included John Travolta, John Candy Jr., Toni Morrison, and other co-stars -- as well as fellow ''I'm the only one who has a 'I'm the only one'' attitude.'' When Anderson first came on the scene, he described casting him as `` a pretty great guy and a fairly interesting movie man -- a little eccentric, and he's still very much at that. He actually has a very deep sense of humor that has definitely affected me with the times, with the way he dresses and the way he looks on TV and films -- and he actually has a very nice sense of what movies are for, and what we want to do with them. I can't say enough how cool he is, how he was, and how he can do things really well. He really likes working with actors. He's really, really nice.''\n\nAnderson has taken to working on television shows such as ''Hannibal'' and \"Saving Private Ryan,'' and also on small-scale projects for such as the new film, ''The Hunger Games.''\n\nAnderson was recently interviewed by Variety for a TV interview where he said one of his fondest memories was hearing the word ''puppy'' thrown around when he auditioned for 'Sesame Street' in 1996. Anderson said he always found those words fascinating.\n\n\"We got two days into rehearsals that day as they were coming through -- that's when I remember hearing one of the old school movies -- 'How It Fell,' 'My Little Pony,' and then I was like, wow, this sounds like a nice idea?\" said Anderson.\n\nAnderson also recently mentioned the idea of putting him in a similar role in movie adaptations of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay -- Part 1.\n\n\"I think there's maybe a little over 35 million kids watching Mockingjay -- Part 1, and with kids actually having the idea of going to see that movie -- and I think it's a big, big deal that the Hunger Games movie is going to get made,\" said Anderson of the original Hunger Games film. \"I think there were a lot of people who had seen The Hunger Games before, but never had those kids see the Hunger Games movie. I guess that just goes on and on and on and on and on and on. I think people want to get that movie. I think that's what's actually happening with some of these franchises that have gone to film. They want to see these stories -- and they want that movie -- that they can see more, to see our families.\"\n\nHe continued that it's always important for children to be brought up to the big screen, and that they want to know that they will \"feel real life moments for a minute\" when it comes to how the movies are set. \"... The movie and my whole life, I really love the little things you can see, that have a natural feel to them in their smallness and smallness and lightness and how they look and how they speak and how they move.\"","token_len":653,"entropy":[10.2582,8.5411,0.0026,0.1535,5.5102,7.8208,1.2636,5.6468,2.8408,9.2997,3.2451,3.8582,2.1199,3.824,0.4349,0.9876,1.3697,7.3793,1.8611,8.7924,0.0695,1.9101,7.8782,5.2064,0.4111,9.14,10.3671,4.8779,10.449,10.7242,4.1423,5.7513,3.4478,6.1743,4.3782,2.5035,0.0737,0.0001,0.0,0.5358,3.2629,5.4233,5.5688,0.2555,5.7821,2.8598,1.1848,0.1677,2.0441,4.5025,5.6206,0.029,0.1408,6.7962,3.1775,0.1307,0.0031,4.2322,6.1683,5.6154,1.8425,3.4262,3.7655,0.7228,1.2239,2.6945,1.8558,6.074,3.412,0.6645,0.1873,0.1846,0.0287,4.2336,3.4456,0.9976,4.9965,2.9779,2.3795,3.1397,1.933,1.5185,0.726,0.9333,0.9015,3.8572,6.9747,1.6861,0.164,1.6865,1.8958,4.6376,4.4654,1.4467,2.861,1.4262,5.8298,4.4038,6.3373,4.1648,5.5144,2.2731,3.6853,4.6138,1.3414,3.2315,2.4516,1.6954,5.2171,2.5818,0.9155,4.2816,2.9344,3.0687,1.5116,6.0308,2.1067,0.7291,2.2394,4.9622,2.1928,0.1008,0.174,3.3121,4.2435,5.3493,5.4302,2.0137,5.0183,1.6842,4.8348,2.312,3.553,1.2629,2.5264,0.6751,4.6173,1.0761,1.2546,0.1725,0.0703,3.0034,4.3969,4.3133,1.899,3.9871,3.1637,1.4045,1.7627,4.9221,1.6165,0.7604,1.6667,3.6736,1.4467,0.0484,4.9895,5.2731,0.6621,4.0779,1.8001,0.86,1.6442,4.169,2.6595,0.4147,0.6142,0.7916,0.6786,0.7562,1.8245,4.009,0.8792,1.8589,1.6325,4.1946,4.6289,1.103,0.1781,2.0858,1.9002,2.484,5.2915,2.1981,0.6757,0.7601,1.4596,4.43,2.478,2.4556,5.2011,0.3917,1.1479,1.4664,3.1319,4.2195,3.7606,0.2819,2.1448,1.7253,1.0943,1.1953,2.4721,3.1704,0.0402,2.2401,2.8312,1.0584,0.0005,1.5534,2.1547,5.3586,1.7665,3.5062,2.3895,3.6015,1.6219,1.8679,0.0038,1.3153,5.4326,1.6792,0.0179,0.905,0.2131,2.8281,4.486,2.7937,0.052,0.0025,1.0967,1.5115,3.6733,2.5122,5.8121,1.2346,2.4579,1.227,4.2691,3.1234,1.8568,2.2573,4.126,4.1138,2.1908,0.6176,1.7228,5.0348,0.0037,1.7463,2.0758,0.0002,1.322,2.9862,3.3178,2.2206,0.6047,3.5716,2.8966,1.6685,4.7619,2.2707,5.1586,0.0594,2.0941,6.1619,0.2772,0.4329,5.4542,0.0047,0.3376,1.9486,5.9565,2.3629,3.7719,1.146,4.7849,3.0527,0.088,0.5186,3.9334,0.335,3.5215,0.6691,3.9884,0.003,0.1556,5.2752,3.5072,4.7591,0.0008,1.7539,1.2114,3.6472,0.2065,2.1133,1.0575,1.188,4.4872,4.3718,5.089,1.9759,5.4242,1.5077,0.8198,0.0003,1.1663,4.6426,3.9554,5.8519,5.7911,4.4833,4.4849,0.0108,4.0941,1.2132,6.0373,4.0146,0.3498,3.6761,3.6892,4.882,4.0683,1.3115,0.7294,0.829,3.0329,2.9748,4.7724,0.4921,0.768,5.1809,3.4067,5.1925,2.837,1.2615,5.2261,5.5706,6.3937,2.1881,2.5105,4.7511,2.1125,0.1209,0.9036,1.2068,3.1449,1.2831,2.493,0.8138,0.1365,4.3527,0.3908,2.1001,4.6152,1.1985,1.3085,5.226,3.3526,6.8812,2.9137,0.0197,0.2832,1.423,0.0002,1.1339,2.3998,3.8759,4.8112,2.4925,3.2778,0.337,4.7468,3.0769,0.9331,0.9285,5.0074,0.6061,2.6811,6.6136,2.0512,0.3736,4.1257,2.0751,0.0039,2.2377,0.5345,0.0007,0.0001,1.6833,0.021,0.3619,1.8451,0.8723,0.0002,0.6289,1.0233,1.9338,2.7766,0.7294,6.1469,1.0915,2.0373,6.1841,5.9279,1.9593,4.0183,2.0211,2.6643,0.02,0.0005,0.8628,0.0276,0.0252,1.9863,1.0133,6.0737,5.3712,5.6564,2.8789,2.7406,4.5249,0.788,3.2967,1.0594,1.8965,2.3677,0.627,3.2426,2.0879,1.7027,0.6936,2.0464,0.6673,2.0293,3.9356,3.5643,0.5335,1.5843,3.0532,3.0904,3.1822,0.0068,2.1607,1.2382,1.4173,0.0197,4.2601,2.1629,1.6855,0.7518,0.0131,4.7053,0.655,4.3293,1.5625,0.0252,2.4364,0.3349,0.5134,1.5309,0.7419,2.4647,4.5758,1.3064,0.5107,0.0206,1.5097,0.7792,3.2957,3.2062,4.3558,0.0529,0.0205,2.6675,1.339,2.1351,5.1513,2.5637,6.0195,3.2045,2.3486,1.7254,1.5453,0.0158,0.8904,0.651,1.5006,4.9346,1.9256,5.0054,2.9646,5.9939,0.4016,0.046,1.8333,0.0601,1.9047,0.1016,1.7174,0.1121,1.4755,0.0919,1.1467,1.3867,0.6696,3.5283,4.04,0.2864,3.5048,3.1138,0.7698,3.2224,0.8929,0.4587,1.8216,0.7934,1.7565,1.9973,6.2032,1.9359,1.5041,5.5594,0.203,1.6732,5.3029,2.5444,1.7808,3.811,3.3239,4.6191,1.4551,2.6074,1.709,0.2791,1.675,4.0119,4.1451,4.5814,1.4696,2.1516,0.935,4.9249,1.0402,2.7811,2.9496,1.7896,1.2356,2.5695,5.8943,3.5672,4.8109,0.9889,6.6719,5.1448,4.4134,0.31,0.0002,4.2859,3.0786,4.1816,3.7045,1.099,4.22,2.599,1.2333,3.7657,0.2446,2.0239,6.0005,0.1301,1.687,1.9418,4.5861,0.9279,1.3752,1.0914,1.2571,2.9605,3.8606,0.2662,2.7948,1.9469,1.507,3.2317,5.73,4.116,3.9304,4.4637,5.9746,4.3498,1.8219,4.2845,2.9119,1.5543,3.1594,0.1473,0.0546,4.3837,2.6082,3.3243,1.0048,4.3794,1.1202,6.962,3.6939,3.1152,5.0306,4.5276,3.7398,0.7167,1.837,1.0775,3.8395,3.1597,2.0001,4.7042,1.6451,3.8495,1.323,2.7226,2.3323,3.5301,4.3241,2.2008,5.9389,2.4824,0.8308,0.2085,4.4513,2.7509,5.3267,3.7665,1.0687,2.8768,0.2315,1.4205,4.9057,0.0419,0.8156,5.6809,1.047,2.7649,1.5192,1.114,0.2171,3.9956,1.3153,0.467,0.1154,2.4799,3.1494]}
{"id":382,"ended":false,"length":611,"gen_text":"The play repeatedly mocks Victorian traditions and social customs, marriage and the pursuit of love in particular. In Victorian times earnestness was considered to be the over @ - @ riding societal value system 'which has in its negative way been promoted and promoted many times.\n\n'The play is designed to provide an opportunity for an authentic connection to love, and to be a powerful play,' wrote Pynner. 'There is ample time for this intimate communication of emotions before it becomes difficult to make any real conclusions about your motives and actions. It's quite clear you're trying to give some perspective.'\n\nHe says his friend has been trying to write the play for over three weeks and the review has been particularly difficult on him for speaking out since he is a married man. A few of Pysch's plays are more than 40 years old, making their time in a busy Victorian school day-in-life extremely hard to pass up.\n\n'It's a really difficult work, and we're very, very happy that someone has taken the time to say something really honest about some of the key elements of love and good deeds, and given them a lot of space. A lot of conversations are taking place about the relationship between love, marriage and death, although it is very much a personal affair where the play might even be read in your own context.\n\n'People are asking us what we will reveal later, what 'counseling' we might provide for you. There is nothing I would suggest that anybody has got in their way or could provide us as they find it important. The play will help you get to know yourself better, and it will provide you an option to be your own human, and a human whose experience is not meant to be taken personally. It's also certainly very important at the beginning that we leave all the 'jokey-y' conversations that may lead to 'I'm sorry', 'you're a horrible person', 'you're not a nice person', 'you're not a good person' entirely to chance with people you are going to love, even though that will be an almost impossible task for most people, because not all of them will have the same experience of being sad.\n\n'What I hope you are doing is also about having a positive conversation about what sort of person you are. When you talk about your life and your personal life for a while you think about being on the same wavelength with people \u2013 someone who is really trying to live the right life. I'm sure you will be quite, very grateful to my dear friend for writing about this in the play.\n\n'But before long if it's your turn, ask yourself these questions of yourself, what do I need you to believe me when I tell my story?'\n\nPysch has previously said he would never play 'in person', and he also has one of his own private messages posted on his YouTube channel.\n\nIn a new video that shows off a scene from his play, Pysch said in the caption \u2013 'There is very much more I need you to believe in.

{"id":1233,"ended":false,"length":641,"gen_text":"The defense maintained that Abu @ - @ Jamal was innocent and that the prosecution witnesses were unreliable. The defense presented nine character witnesses, including poet Sonia Sanchez, who testified that Abu'' Jamal had no idea what was going on and that the attorney had to turn his case in motion with evidence that would have enabled the government to convict the's case in the first place. [7] An important development in this case is that Abu was not involved in the murder and that the defense presented five witnesses -- none of whom were named in the defense record. According to the defense, three of the four victims who died were children. The prosecution continued with their case with questions about whether the children belonged to Abu'' Jamal and whether Abu was involved. [8] Following the defense's arguments against any use of eyewitnesses, the defense presented the testimony of one of four individuals who testified about Abu'' Jamal but did not list its names : John Allen 'Sanchez, and Jamal'' Jamal 'Sanchez, and an attorney named Jonathan 'Pas. The jurors called all three of the witnesses who testified, and all found that the prosecution's evidence did not support Abu's claim. The third verdict was a direct repudiation of the defense's charge that Abu was not responsible for Abu's murders. The four others who did not testify were also acquitted (two were still serving their sentences under other circumstances, and had been released on similar conditions without any further hearings). This is the fourth jury trial where the defense had claimed that two witnesses who were not involved in the case had fabricated or exaggerated the case against Abu. In one episode, after three days of testimony, five of Abu's children - Ahmad, Ibrahim and Jamal - testified about Abu's disappearance and their mother had told the defence that they had been able to verify his abduction in the dead of night. Abu'' Jamal'Sanchez, then an uncle of Jamal's mother, later told the prosecution that the two children were telling the truth during their time working together and told the case with no corroborating testimony that Abu'''s disappearance could be prevented. They said that they could not have believed Abu had disappeared and they hoped the prosecution would offer the new information that would stop Abu's alleged abduction. In any event, Abu'''s case was dropped from the list of crimes committed by Abu's killers by the trial court. When Jamal, on the other hand, told the jury of what he remembered of the abduction in Abu's book she gave her testimony during her first day in the courtroom, he was not convicted in the death penalty. [9] By virtue of his trial, Abu was given the right to appeal from any conviction he may reach. One of Abu's trial witnesses testified that he had never been to Abu's prison and that there was no indication that Abu had been living there prior to Jamal's murder, implying that Abu was merely a regular visitor and a witness to his life at Abu's time in Abu's prison. He later asked the court to rule that Abu was not a \"pariah of Islam.\" Judge Martin Smith of Detroit held that Abu had committed a \"serious\" crime and did not have an \"adequate defense to put Abu's death behind him\".\" [10]\n\n1 2","token_len":656,"entropy":[8.4298,8.4804,0.5729,8.267,12.2363,9.5568,3.2358,7.9705,3.8704,5.637,1.8526,1.9052,2.2163,3.9064,7.4798,1.7609,5.8562,1.0808,2.3432,0.7805,4.6568,7.7407,10.8405,0.3761,1.9517,1.2565,12.8595,10.1234,8.1829,1.0333,1.2423,2.4276,0.8414,1.7041,11.4299,7.6307,2.3205,3.0464,3.715,2.0588,2.0597,0.5538,0.0312,1.9383,1.5478,2.2127,6.0198,2.0845,3.7797,5.2647,3.4111,5.4733,3.9989,6.1257,4.9472,4.698,1.9847,2.4742,1.8352,5.4168,0.8867,4.5962,0.0961,2.9933,3.0015,12.2266,4.529,3.9537,1.7299,0.2883,0.0206,0.275,4.8097,4.9886,0.3581,5.9644,4.2937,5.5421,1.3889,1.2589,0.2609,1.2456,0.4863,1.9726,2.4284,1.6541,4.1423,0.1881,0.8022,3.3656,3.4075,1.331,1.29,1.4054,2.9492,4.5856,1.1221,5.4909,2.8973,0.0986,0.1929,1.3305,3.8183,0.5492,0.4085,0.8604,4.7261,0.7945,5.3868,0.0017,0.7714,0.3135,0.3288,4.4226,0.1753,0.9678,2.0926,5.7937,3.0255,2.09,0.8533,4.2369,0.9891,1.5416,2.8497,5.5006,3.0645,3.8073,2.5514,3.669,6.0567,1.2171,1.9345,1.453,3.1129,5.0465,0.0395,0.9062,3.0117,0.1052,2.2618,1.1265,2.144,1.3936,2.1484,2.4126,2.294,0.0787,0.0033,5.7284,0.8935,1.5799,0.2223,3.9153,3.6218,5.493,5.5303,0.0146,5.5475,1.6833,0.7774,0.754,0.4954,2.3866,2.4731,3.3449,0.0929,2.6598,1.0135,5.9512,4.5251,1.0045,1.2048,2.8824,1.2682,1.2276,0.015,5.5493,1.7142,0.0181,5.5499,7.2067,2.2074,8.929,5.5355,6.1357,7.0365,3.5059,3.6795,1.7552,5.595,4.3686,4.4986,4.1874,1.5668,1.4275,0.037,0.8513,2.8314,5.9326,2.4021,1.9214,5.1131,3.5964,3.9413,4.1782,6.3274,2.4471,6.5893,5.4337,3.6341,1.9289,1.0043,0.9998,1.3246,2.293,1.2732,2.1238,1.7214,2.4998,7.2167,1.963,1.6768,1.84,1.8016,2.5368,2.8526,0.0291,0.8425,1.0137,1.9826,2.4961,2.4011,1.3279,6.9175,7.2237,1.098,3.1627,4.5584,4.1792,0.0008,0.0638,0.5728,1.1608,0.1666,5.143,0.7531,0.5449,1.0011,2.1883,2.7538,0.1619,3.2642,1.6609,4.2198,0.5187,1.1717,4.6674,3.7115,1.032,2.7199,0.2307,2.1806,1.3744,4.5922,2.9876,5.0079,3.5217,1.8564,5.2973,2.8575,1.8232,0.5038,5.7784,5.3267,2.328,1.6446,1.2807,4.5302,1.767,2.0293,2.8397,5.4466,2.2027,6.5632,2.4565,2.4996,3.907,0.509,3.9957,2.3504,1.7076,3.8348,4.1138,1.5606,3.9696,1.1391,0.6898,3.2041,5.4273,0.9002,6.3452,2.6567,2.2603,1.8195,1.7155,4.1237,0.1603,0.3406,2.3459,2.6118,5.4301,3.9813,3.8533,1.2374,3.6619,3.0185,0.1521,0.6812,2.5598,4.4241,7.0653,0.5176,4.7346,5.5462,2.4343,0.2348,1.5072,0.4682,5.4902,1.2156,2.7068,1.0724,3.8958,5.4481,4.9397,1.0562,4.3361,1.5163,3.1847,0.1837,1.8164,2.048,1.2479,1.5049,4.6037,1.7011,4.0574,5.1333,3.6254,2.376,1.6555,6.0058,0.6343,1.8786,1.1228,1.7349,5.4885,0.002,5.4714,2.9381,5.5574,3.7648,1.5215,5.9205,0.0616,0.0502,0.7404,2.7789,3.1874,0.1593,5.711,2.3911,16.841,1.7056,4.6691,3.8394,4.8668,0.3519,1.4031,1.3287,4.832,0.2665,4.2635,1.5129,0.5799,3.2274,0.4119,2.4929,2.7812,1.8373,1.8497,4.9411,0.5278,0.4168,5.6427,1.8258,3.3748,5.0138,1.6705,2.5844,4.3569,0.9394,5.7035,6.356,2.4354,2.7054,1.0196,2.985,4.37,0.8841,2.4094,7.7893,1.4775,2.2158,4.7744,2.7906,4.2201,0.7515,4.9706,2.6594,0.5997,2.0237,3.0911,1.1586,2.4416,4.0405,2.3173,2.3825,2.2511,2.0134,3.1579,5.4792,2.3683,2.0042,0.3318,5.6117,2.6361,5.696,2.8918,1.6149,1.8529,5.637,1.2071,1.6473,5.8607,1.6891,0.4962,2.9443,4.7946,0.2659,0.0202,1.835,1.3879,4.1507,0.7617,3.0775,0.5138,3.081,2.6991,0.3089,2.8466,0.1176,4.1967,2.6353,0.6834,1.4905,2.4247,3.0207,4.4344,0.9453,3.6891,1.0801,0.9517,5.0204,5.9263,3.5078,5.3428,0.821,0.3364,0.0121,0.0132,3.6703,0.2712,1.3137,3.612,4.3905,1.0336,4.3496,0.9582,1.6819,3.6833,3.7412,2.5839,1.0972,6.4881,6.4538,4.0276,4.0614,1.7648,5.3685,1.9993,3.5178,1.4268,1.8956,0.9861,1.2773,1.4417,2.7959,1.7458,2.3077,4.1177,3.8515,0.9802,4.6164,0.2437,1.1589,2.277,0.0388,0.0039,5.4347,6.1272,0.0033,1.6443,3.9323,0.6659,0.5588,1.5637,3.4123,1.2565,1.9528,0.0628,1.5114,3.5744,3.621,2.6614,2.233,1.9141,7.1022,1.3423,5.5751,0.7444,2.2207,0.3277,5.8146,1.8056,2.1797,0.4052,1.2616,1.4982,2.6899,2.3961,1.9352,0.7045,1.2452,4.6838,1.4836,0.8089,4.4548,0.7093,0.4938,4.6715,0.5643,0.9989,1.0915,1.224,5.2023,0.6823,4.7641,0.0012,3.1012,0.3118,2.0616,3.4366,6.4354,0.147,1.205,1.1189,4.9738,2.1215,4.9427,1.5531,3.4568,3.6685,4.3816,1.0423,2.3994,2.7595,3.6985,1.5487,0.662,3.614,2.5047,1.3161,0.2494,0.7838,0.1583,2.8934,4.532,5.94,1.1117,1.8133,0.9129,4.75,0.9251,1.6675,1.1222,0.9688,1.8668,2.4304,5.1702,1.8001,4.8118,3.2847,1.6158,5.7758,5.1342,5.5789,3.4009,5.9755,4.7124,0.4601,0.4775,2.0548,3.6902,2.0995,1.4348,3.3418,3.6409,0.3092,1.4528,4.5633,0.0754,1.5127,3.5642,1.8275,4.3654,0.015,3.0126,2.5314,5.6068,3.9527,2.105,3.0254,4.2553,0.3329,2.8779,9.7023,1.4006,0.036,0.0099,2.9929,0.0565,6.0165,5.323]}
{"id":1980,"ended":true,"length":585,"gen_text":"The People's Army of Vietnam had been utilizing large sections of relatively unpopulated eastern Cambodia as sanctuaries into which they could withdraw from the struggle in South Vietnam to rest and reorganize without being exposed to any danger. This would be similar to the approach taken by the Communist regime in Central America when they forced Cubans into the country and subjected them to forced labor to earn their living.\n\nThis could not have happened with those two countries that began training the Vietnamese and the U.S. Forces during the early 1970s, and the U.S. Army could not have been placed under military occupation in the new country, since the Communist Party of South Vietnam (CPLA) was now the largest and most populous communist country on earth. That is why the United States did not give Cambodia what it wanted for its long time effort on South Vietnam.\n\nWhat can be done has to be done in the coming months.\n\nThis can be done, in the form of increasing and deepening the local forces. As part of our continuing effort at strengthening and deepening our local forces, the United States has deployed a tremendous amount of military forces in Cambodia, while in Laos the U.S. will continue moving towards some sort of military transition from a limited, armed and armored force (in Cambodia) to a full armed force comprised of heavy equipment. When we do this, the results can be immense.\n\nThe United States military personnel will be trained, ready and equipped to lead and provide defense. Training is already ongoing in the Hanoi area in response to a joint military strike as well as the recent announcement that the CIA has ordered the deployment of 100-strong paramilitary force units in Vietnam to assist in joint U.S.-Thailand training by the end of 2018.\n\nWe need to do more.\n\nAs U.S. Ambassador to Thailand, Ambassador Kelly McNeill announced that the U.S. would contribute an additional 1.3% of its annual military budget for the year ending March 2018 to the effort to promote the national interests and security of Cambodia with the creation of the National Defense University (DUSU) near Pattay. The UW will help improve the Cambodian security environment and increase the diversity of its students.\n\nThe United States will contribute $25 million to the National Alliance for Phnom Penh (NANPP) to help support the construction of the first major building for NANPP that has a 1,400-year history of its existence and to help maintain the educational activities of the NANPP community and preserve and preserve its heritage.\n\nWith new U.S. military activities that begin this September, we will work together to build on those successes, and we will lead the country by our own actions. We will take a tough stand when it all comes to Cambodia, when the U.S. sends its forces, its personnel, its facilities, and its political elite into battle, but we will also work with the Vietnamese government to further strengthen local democracy and bring back a free and independent Republic.\n\nWe can only wait for our government to fulfill all that it is asked for. It will ask for one thing, and yet it will ask in return for just another two.","token_len":657,"entropy":[8.185,0.5691,4.5818,1.8881,4.6231,4.8134,2.098,10.1974,5.4955,6.4199,0.0185,10.4181,5.9709,0.0007,5.863,3.3158,3.1288,9.4615,0.0038,0.0,7.3808,0.2853,1.8315,1.9112,6.094,2.3962,1.5519,8.1629,3.5267,4.3169,0.0769,4.1424,9.2406,2.9474,5.5744,0.072,7.4584,3.0554,2.6146,0.2287,3.6356,3.2361,0.6819,3.0327,4.1389,2.0283,5.6272,0.0941,0.7655,4.0496,1.1995,0.2937,0.5582,4.5963,3.4135,0.6541,4.595,1.7804,3.9259,1.7813,4.755,5.3882,0.013,1.883,2.1752,4.5678,2.2224,5.6015,0.0617,0.0744,3.4001,0.2566,3.913,4.341,2.0748,0.1417,0.4695,1.1758,0.0064,3.5388,5.7127,1.7125,0.8583,1.5316,3.3406,6.1288,5.3582,3.0173,2.9914,6.2402,6.5484,2.3651,1.9806,3.3032,2.6245,3.5118,0.0624,0.0058,0.0873,5.3835,3.8352,0.3641,3.1198,2.4708,0.1255,1.994,2.0316,2.3515,2.2905,0.0008,0.0034,0.0415,3.0414,4.205,0.3345,0.3312,1.6843,5.4978,2.4042,3.6999,2.6681,1.96,1.9773,5.8296,2.05,2.8668,3.3954,1.5069,4.1197,2.1427,2.231,3.6318,0.0563,2.1018,2.4113,2.6202,0.0571,1.8598,4.9147,2.6563,3.3554,2.1644,0.3337,5.5438,3.3768,3.4671,3.1781,0.9527,0.3146,5.1962,1.9285,1.0365,1.0444,2.8108,0.0671,3.5102,0.0788,5.4657,3.7946,5.2,0.2057,1.0161,3.6479,1.8497,5.3706,3.9364,5.2038,4.3055,5.1419,0.1619,1.0289,1.0591,0.0002,4.1842,4.7138,0.7137,1.2697,6.9165,1.1691,0.3771,0.5781,2.4553,1.5287,4.3307,1.3633,1.4228,2.7036,0.0002,4.2421,5.5557,0.7888,0.4537,2.8779,2.4809,2.2122,1.6696,0.0087,5.524,4.9716,1.6361,1.3441,5.5389,4.0945,2.4296,4.2727,4.0451,0.0009,2.9396,4.8789,2.004,3.5606,3.0512,2.8233,1.6735,1.5837,2.1906,0.6358,0.321,1.9583,1.2782,0.0177,1.6718,4.6486,2.3449,5.1458,0.5157,0.003,2.7774,2.1042,1.5188,2.4265,1.5026,5.18,4.3191,2.9123,2.2193,1.1974,0.0008,0.003,0.0271,5.7355,1.4088,6.9016,5.2175,5.3086,1.887,0.0004,2.7478,5.613,3.7454,2.2619,5.6572,3.1635,5.2682,2.7541,4.3184,0.8528,4.3745,4.4397,3.5602,1.4326,0.1151,0.4543,2.4301,3.4136,0.9627,5.9211,0.1987,5.3208,2.1831,1.9883,6.1555,1.5291,3.5495,1.0782,0.2507,1.7062,4.3415,3.9238,0.2524,5.6952,0.4807,0.6149,0.0001,2.069,1.7637,0.0098,3.9667,5.1083,2.3619,1.2907,3.2215,2.527,5.3473,0.8846,2.374,0.7279,5.5035,2.1095,4.6138,4.9352,3.2601,5.8976,2.636,3.2088,4.2011,1.0693,2.1996,5.4256,0.1355,0.0007,2.3012,3.7375,4.0797,0.0043,2.9513,5.7913,2.5382,5.2617,6.6142,1.0258,0.0249,2.1043,3.2615,4.1806,1.5255,1.1307,4.7275,1.7877,3.7673,1.4467,1.9337,0.0177,4.5205,5.4864,3.8962,5.0148,3.1371,1.7783,1.4569,2.9614,1.9725,2.7759,1.63,5.3824,4.215,0.0037,0.0056,0.8629,3.9312,0.7438,3.6899,6.45,0.7763,1.3162,0.0009,3.665,0.0987,0.813,0.0001,2.5411,3.5536,0.5129,2.8084,1.3459,1.5104,1.1074,0.0001,3.3045,5.4339,0.0009,0.0024,0.0373,5.1146,0.5284,2.7642,1.2649,2.3969,5.75,5.2451,5.1179,4.878,2.1508,0.9935,1.0796,0.0007,0.0038,0.0465,1.9022,4.9166,4.5213,0.1031,2.5246,2.4474,2.1836,5.6926,0.1733,1.3944,2.4534,1.5849,0.7432,4.1881,1.417,3.291,1.9148,1.8513,1.381,0.4338,1.4576,5.0341,0.2907,4.5084,2.0954,3.9348,3.9728,2.7164,2.0736,0.0195,2.974,5.8025,1.2617,5.1413,0.0411,2.3356,1.2731,2.233,1.0351,1.5014,2.9851,2.8031,0.2041,1.0192,6.2105,4.3312,4.996,1.6979,1.7591,6.173,1.0859,3.7358,4.9775,0.9551,4.2481,0.0038,3.2419,1.424,1.0883,3.938,0.968,5.3471,0.3834,2.318,1.4226,1.0509,0.8199,0.0001,1.6986,3.3058,0.0098,1.1819,3.5216,1.4257,3.9011,0.3869,1.2772,0.7865,2.8479,5.5093,0.6196,5.1659,0.1949,0.0003,0.0005,2.0537,1.0559,2.9799,1.18,1.2497,1.1333,2.6176,2.6735,1.0346,3.6016,0.2063,1.3215,4.5085,4.2459,4.5436,3.4318,3.5003,0.0428,0.0093,3.1911,4.5225,3.3124,4.6271,0.5626,2.9714,0.2309,2.923,0.3781,1.0306,4.8519,3.5484,2.2496,2.7659,2.6953,4.4931,1.0222,4.9893,5.8395,1.0069,0.7132,1.3882,0.0171,0.0051,5.5708,2.5411,5.9831,3.4909,3.3346,1.1504,1.9255,0.3374,0.5721,0.0001,4.7675,6.4808,2.4087,0.0011,0.0016,0.0972,1.3676,5.8024,4.5402,3.675,2.359,4.3631,0.3481,1.485,1.0062,3.6281,2.9086,0.788,2.9306,1.5337,3.5416,1.682,2.2547,1.4523,2.0561,0.2529,5.9347,0.8805,4.009,3.8992,3.6118,2.9984,2.3745,0.9932,2.0438,0.5067,4.4974,2.9882,5.4678,1.6286,4.256,0.9308,9.2006,0.196,1.2672,2.1049,1.3726,3.58,1.851,2.1777,0.0007,0.0019,0.0681,5.2593,1.5676,2.2997,1.7644,2.6595,3.4451,0.8861,1.1099,4.1533,0.8485,0.6619,0.4938,4.2306,5.926,1.6377,4.4507,1.6362,2.4337,1.119,0.2527,1.6977,2.7244,1.2508,1.406,2.2385,1.4023,0.6722,5.4316,1.7813,5.0915,4.2734,0.671,3.8577,3.0218,3.5354,4.1082,0.4743,1.7972,4.7925,0.6853,0.3616,0.0001,1.8491,3.4295,2.3941,5.7707,1.7943,2.5185,3.9556,0.2509,4.1138,3.4577,3.4123,1.0036,2.7046,4.2181,3.0281,1.2308,3.9669,1.9407,5.3781,0.6557,5.428,0.5283,1.8427,1.0588,5.531,0.845,1.4121,2.1183,5.8006,0.9672,0.78,4.8072,3.3509,4.4902,1.3362]}

{"id":1726,"ended":false,"length":571,"gen_text":"As the Luftwaffe meteorological centre in Paris had predicted two weeks of stormy weather, some Wehrmacht commanders were away from the front attending war games in Rennes, and many soldiers had been given training in German air defense in the south to prepare for the impending blitz.\n\nThe Luftwaffe would soon have a plan to combat those odds.\n\nWhen Rennes was ravaged by attacks by German airplanes on Thursday, officials warned that even if Luftwaffe forces did not lose control of the area, they wouldn't have been able to control where they wanted.\n\nThe Allies were concerned that the new Germans might have taken advantage of the new terrain, which was more than 200km (50 miles) north of Le Havre, to bombard the capital with artillery, smoke, artillery fire and heavy machine gun fire.\n\nAt a recent Allied command post in Germany, Lt Colonel G\u00fcnter Ebert, commanding officer of the Luftwaffe division, told the Associated Press he was surprised that German troops never returned to Le Havre, which was a target of heavy German fire.\n\nMeanwhile, in Rennes, the fighting in the south went deeper. A German Air Guard squadron on a training exercise had just attacked two Allied positions in Rhine-Westphalia, a coastal town where Luftwaffe planes bombarded the villages of Meuse and Montrouge.\n\nIn the northern part of France, a similar fighting was ongoing, and on Monday, the Luftwaffe aircraft conducted a sortie in the town, a position the RAF called \"the worst air fight in history.\"\n\nAlthough many Germans said they expected little more damage from the raids, it did bring them some solace. The German forces had not been able to control the area for two days, and at least one German soldier suggested the Luftwaffe was ready to send a few planes if the Germans moved.\n\nHe said he had seen tanks and fighter jets flying over the area over the last two days, but that it was too early to assess the extent of the Luftwaffe's losses.\n\n\"On the one hand, their own air strikes are a bit more severe than what the Russians would have done under the Bf 109 bomber,\" Ebert said. \"On the other, it's possible that the Luftwaffe has had one or two planes over that area before and can be just as likely to strike where it's likely to be hit. The Luftwaffe has had some planes over there and they'll probably fly over it.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone in France felt that the loss of Luftwaffe control in Rennes was good news.\n\n\"This is not our last day here and we'll probably be a lot closer for a couple hours,\" Jean-Marie Desboules, a young soldier who fled north for France after his life-threatening battle at the Lille Forest, said in a telephone conversation. \"... The Luftwaffe is like no other. The Germans are too busy fighting, no matter how hard they work, because their last move will be no matter how hard they try. There won't be any fighting in Rennes.\"","token_len":661,"entropy":[2.9307,11.9245,1.1743,0.0066,0.0002,11.1186,2.0565,5.3176,1.3109,5.6208,4.2894,5.7923,5.1291,2.9685,5.5429,5.7168,1.253,0.5061,1.2177,5.2809,13.0232,0.4427,0.0619,0.0012,3.8761,1.6758,9.2037,2.1902,1.0741,4.1546,12.9491,6.0877,0.6146,1.973,5.9738,1.2129,1.6175,2.4167,4.2311,3.6183,2.2782,1.538,5.0592,3.7964,1.1877,3.6785,3.8513,2.4446,3.9677,1.3956,3.9408,4.8879,2.237,0.2409,1.0572,4.1658,4.392,1.0413,0.6764,0.0026,1.8939,2.4179,0.0011,0.0025,0.0004,4.8041,3.1691,2.5456,2.3446,4.102,1.438,5.0916,5.3335,5.1163,0.8438,1.338,0.0002,5.283,6.5044,0.0624,1.0931,5.3928,0.193,6.4727,1.0116,2.4135,5.5268,1.7419,5.0412,0.7725,5.2779,4.2601,0.7957,4.8885,1.0622,4.2446,0.0049,0.03,0.0058,2.9034,3.1147,0.3475,4.1834,2.5724,0.293,0.4899,2.9123,0.5365,1.5798,5.8278,0.0006,2.0367,3.9754,0.0987,0.0038,3.5911,6.5511,1.5728,4.571,1.7169,0.7611,0.0002,2.1366,5.3777,2.2574,5.4208,0.6516,1.3922,5.7899,5.252,2.024,2.9568,3.7531,1.7287,0.0182,0.785,3.6487,2.9588,1.9851,2.3167,1.8306,3.8579,2.4712,3.5534,2.3226,0.7744,3.2144,0.011,0.0119,3.7998,0.4443,5.6787,0.3948,0.0004,1.2349,1.2965,5.3445,1.0127,4.6799,3.4925,2.5003,2.2586,5.8866,1.5337,2.9381,1.0432,0.2643,3.3539,0.6005,1.2604,0.1067,0.2968,0.267,0.0003,4.4332,2.7592,4.2654,5.6813,4.9104,1.4945,0.8958,3.4993,0.292,2.8409,2.9845,5.2784,3.4704,1.0711,0.0067,4.6278,3.6386,1.0148,3.142,1.9103,0.151,0.2347,0.9548,0.0014,0.0078,0.0007,5.8235,1.0964,1.7595,1.6311,4.0592,0.0013,2.8728,1.531,4.2342,1.6906,2.9406,1.8332,6.633,5.1343,0.7124,2.5498,0.0011,0.0013,1.9537,2.7992,1.4711,2.9954,4.7597,1.5216,3.7528,2.4136,1.3861,1.0123,0.3567,0.0003,6.1518,0.0778,3.0866,3.5745,0.0374,0.2463,1.8252,5.0515,3.0999,0.9344,2.3989,5.7449,6.6633,1.0586,3.3397,2.3452,4.9847,5.2555,3.7332,4.1766,2.1557,2.9901,2.3176,2.6622,3.1429,4.3349,3.7401,4.5123,3.0278,1.8282,6.4143,0.6401,1.4536,0.4986,0.0025,0.0004,0.7112,3.002,5.3423,1.0123,4.1936,2.5143,0.0019,0.0056,0.0046,2.5155,5.572,0.0049,1.4165,4.4449,0.6975,5.3862,1.9622,1.554,5.6517,3.1368,0.4451,1.067,0.4618,0.0003,3.1588,1.5142,3.9963,1.3995,0.0103,4.037,0.159,2.42,4.732,4.1744,1.9643,3.252,1.7444,2.3578,3.559,3.8442,1.3262,1.8104,1.3731,0.0021,0.0061,0.0015,4.7468,5.4764,0.8659,4.0238,0.0149,2.1455,0.828,2.2792,3.3648,3.6578,5.2287,3.2126,4.3734,3.0993,0.8522,2.242,4.2145,3.7386,3.6862,0.8718,2.0142,1.5117,0.409,0.0003,5.5623,4.2693,2.443,4.0968,0.5044,3.068,5.6411,2.3778,6.0703,1.1291,0.4306,5.4494,0.4341,3.5441,3.6376,4.7746,3.8637,3.417,5.8829,0.0005,0.8197,2.9951,3.2423,4.1391,1.6142,3.7926,1.7922,1.2212,0.0062,2.6023,0.781,1.2417,2.3851,3.0881,1.2877,0.7786,0.8986,4.8829,1.3355,1.0108,1.5876,1.4659,6.0462,2.2485,1.2524,0.0011,0.0058,0.0021,2.6816,3.8811,0.1775,4.0238,2.2928,3.3315,3.4924,3.8906,1.4749,2.0082,5.1374,2.0944,0.2464,0.0003,5.7865,1.3355,2.2195,2.1124,3.1354,5.1326,1.3861,3.3808,0.7529,2.2035,1.4111,0.5352,1.5332,5.2166,0.1155,2.3351,2.12,0.4165,0.8583,1.1924,1.6622,2.8694,0.483,1.9476,0.5773,0.0578,3.9995,1.0543,1.9405,0.1286,0.8299,2.8631,0.0015,0.0057,0.0012,0.1169,3.3908,0.2561,0.4421,0.0003,1.1245,5.7396,0.5909,2.017,0.0143,0.4934,6.1455,5.5398,2.9677,6.133,1.9242,2.9243,3.5105,2.428,4.1716,0.8106,1.9689,2.6237,3.5731,3.8464,0.933,1.446,5.0346,1.1254,4.7252,2.5479,0.1108,4.3648,1.0055,2.4083,0.0059,0.245,0.2125,0.2907,0.9286,0.004,0.0208,2.6687,2.7006,0.9955,4.3581,0.44,1.3782,1.0731,0.0023,0.0073,0.0026,2.9099,4.0314,5.298,0.7602,0.1183,3.4168,2.1488,3.7655,0.2452,2.829,3.5822,4.7052,3.4703,5.5041,0.3901,4.1769,0.2096,4.521,5.8734,1.3496,3.1671,5.1177,0.5646,1.9311,1.0846,1.8605,3.5741,2.4796,0.0022,0.0099,0.0029,1.8775,3.2055,2.6385,4.3283,0.3392,1.5659,2.7002,2.0839,4.1455,1.7214,4.0973,1.4674,1.7076,2.3539,0.4152,0.0002,5.0639,0.0304,5.48,1.0925,2.1373,1.9157,3.2961,1.72,1.3598,4.2641,0.1494,2.8132,0.0012,0.0148,0.0122,4.9121,2.5185,2.1836,0.0011,0.7627,3.3099,0.0555,0.8191,0.6701,0.0001,1.3465,3.6419,0.5179,2.2413,4.5913,2.5523,3.9025,2.6276,3.3847,1.2808,3.266,3.6877,2.2686,4.7978,1.7535,2.3493,5.0919,1.5104,2.8985,5.7026,0.9615,4.1343,0.4376,1.9531,5.5103,4.2394,1.8781,7.1369,0.213,0.8608,5.3432,3.1247,1.2856,4.0749,5.3085,3.6253,1.9309,2.4223,2.3115,4.5121,1.8257,0.9726,2.0612,3.2191,1.1676,5.7823,1.2778,5.3419,0.8353,1.1083,1.9812,1.1884,0.9325,4.1852,1.1017,8.0224,2.9205,1.3323,0.0028,0.0131,0.0039,1.3262,5.1528,5.3164,0.3645,3.026,3.2472,2.0887,1.3036,4.8557,3.8576,1.9221,3.0525,6.2424,1.1589,1.0113,2.5153,0.5376,3.4899,1.5737,4.8226,3.9471,4.4489,4.8171,2.2743,0.3418,5.5398,3.09,1.3929,1.102,0.1625,1.5939,1.7773,4.1368,3.9825,0.0003,0.0266,0.9047,3.9127,2.1493,1.6354,0.0048,1.6961]}

Although five of Keshiraja's writings are not traceable, he never married, or in the way that those of others who followed him seem to have done so. In short he was a great poet and grammarian.\nAncariya's translation: \"This is the third part of 'Yostya Kishoreya' 'Nivada\" \u00a0(I am saying it on purpose). He was born in Bombay at Jyoti-Keshirajaswamy (Bharatgarh from 4th century ). There are a couple of reasons for why I would like to speak to him. First of all, the fact that he is a poet is not unusual. He was a graduate of Jyoti-Keshirajaswamy where he learnt an ancient Indian language and lived during the time of Ram and Jana. Second, it is unlikely there is any contemporary known about the life of a poet, so some of the other sources I have come across may be the correct ones.\nSarad\u015bani's translation: \"It is not enough to say that 'Yostya Kishoreya' is a common text of Hindi literature. It's even possible, which is so important, to say so only in Sanskrit language. So what 'Yostya Kishoreya' is says is that Yostiya Kishoreya (the two main sources of literature that originated as Kishoreya ) is a standard language of Indian literature.\"\" (Sarad\u015bani, p. 34.)\nSarad\u015bani gives a good overview of what he means by YostyaKishoreya at my blog. He mentions 'The 'Yostya Sanskrit' as a common form of the word in any Hindi. The English equivalent of 'yostya Kishoreya*' is V.K. P.

{"id":4214,"ended":false,"length":589,"gen_text":"Because of their effectiveness, tolerability, and rapid onset of anxiolytic action, benzodiazepines are frequently used for the treatment of anxiety associated with panic disorder. However, there is disagreement among expert writers on its efficacy in treating anxiety. The major differences between these disorders differ considerably, for example in the amount of anxiolytic action and duration of anxiolytic action. The latter two may be due to other limitations such as the ability of the person to resist immediate adverse reactions and to resist the withdrawal effects of other drugs, and the inability of other drugs to produce significant anxiolytic effects.\n\nA patient with panic disorder who was treated with psilocybin had an increase of anxiety and withdrawal symptoms because her anxiety had increased significantly since first starting to experience panic attacks. This increase in anxiety may have been due to the use of a combination of medications with the potential reduction of both the anxiety generated by this use and the withdrawal effects produced by use during the treatment, and the ability of the sedative drug, psilocybin, to reduce the amount of anxiety generated by its use during the treatment.\n\nWhile psilocybin has been recommended for anxiolytic treatment for many years, some people who are aware of psilocybin's effect have never received it. These studies are the first to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of its use for treating anxiety induced with the medication.\n\nPsilocybin is commonly used as a method of treatment for anxiety associated with panic disorder, especially in the areas of anxiety and anxiety response. It is most effective as treatment for anxiety after three consecutive days of treatment with this medication and will only be used for 24 hours when the person does not have panic disorder, and only for the first 6 days afterward.\n\nIt is used for the treatment of panic disorder and anxiety disorders, such as anxiety based on a belief that there is something that may trigger the symptoms of panic disorder. The use of psilocybin may also cause the person to become hypersensitive or hallucinate, and it may cause the person to show hallucinations that may be associated with anxiety during the first few days of the therapy. During this period, the person will use one or more antidepressants, taking several classes of anxiolytic agents that do not increase anxiety.\n\nPsilocybin is commonly prescribed as an emergency remedy for patients suffering from panic disorder and other distress based on previous panic attack that has a history of severe anxiety related to the events of the panic attack. According to Dr. Charles Vassallo, Professor of Anxiety, Psychiatry, and Counseling, Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, psilocybin is prescribed frequently and is often used with good results and very high success rates to treat the anxiety disorder. psilocybin has been shown to reduce symptoms of panic attack induced anxiety by about 20-30% during clinical trials and it also has efficacy in treating several types of anxiety induced by fear and a lack of self-control problems that occur with these anxiety behaviors. It has no side effects from the main effects of psilocybin, such as making the person feel more alert and alert, making them feel less fearful, reducing the fear of embarrassment, and improving their confidence.\n\nSee also","token_len":664,"entropy":[2.828,3.8889,7.9313,0.6733,12.189,2.3041,0.6363,0.4058,8.341,4.1399,1.5831,10.632,0.0512,0.0006,0.0915,2.5455,0.2726,5.3406,0.0714,0.0023,0.1934,1.137,4.3043,1.1315,2.0383,2.3678,0.1511,0.0082,1.3977,5.9502,0.0525,4.5683,0.5005,0.9594,2.8743,0.0028,2.4943,0.7177,5.3296,2.6917,6.2105,5.9754,1.1724,3.9689,2.1473,2.7442,1.2785,0.9616,1.4157,2.5076,5.4053,4.5452,0.8923,2.8912,5.5109,6.7166,3.4965,2.1563,3.8275,0.6285,3.6051,0.6093,3.8719,0.1159,3.7366,0.0389,0.0003,0.0292,1.4407,1.568,4.2718,0.1769,3.8987,0.0064,0.0005,0.0359,0.2267,0.9022,2.1968,4.4338,4.6694,3.7609,0.756,2.5152,0.1843,5.683,6.0817,3.6603,0.0008,0.9551,4.8172,0.3636,1.0335,5.2617,0.581,3.9941,5.9823,5.2522,1.9457,2.1871,1.612,3.3125,2.006,3.9596,2.0108,0.549,2.9761,0.9774,2.0474,2.0018,0.9077,3.99,0.3547,4.3162,0.8965,0.1224,3.4261,4.183,0.9177,0.0047,0.0004,0.0024,1.4362,0.453,2.3154,0.0006,3.4091,6.508,1.185,1.4806,0.0726,2.057,2.8825,2.5194,0.2458,5.4781,0.319,0.0027,0.0001,4.175,2.8377,2.8814,2.5304,2.0982,1.9545,4.8145,0.5316,5.8441,4.7247,1.3198,2.4154,1.7101,2.8625,4.4318,5.067,2.9492,2.3537,2.9358,3.2256,1.3276,0.6693,2.4652,1.9414,1.034,0.2783,3.089,0.9991,0.4735,0.4864,0.0806,1.2449,3.3496,0.0064,2.6337,2.8829,0.1083,4.2913,3.6395,2.7975,3.9949,7.569,0.4812,5.3538,1.6304,1.9544,6.5582,0.1753,5.5235,4.2681,0.3896,0.3857,0.6977,2.3097,2.8356,0.098,5.4195,7.0531,0.8625,2.2178,4.1207,1.9884,1.4913,4.0827,0.2528,0.9078,6.6008,0.2895,3.4421,2.8329,2.2966,0.0214,0.0283,0.0057,0.3012,0.0931,2.68,0.7667,3.9902,0.0224,0.8941,1.7371,0.2931,4.253,0.3994,1.849,0.4716,0.2033,0.2055,1.8026,0.0002,4.7391,1.4601,0.0001,0.0028,0.0006,1.5875,0.6618,5.7101,0.6663,6.4467,0.0062,0.0002,0.0346,1.1501,1.9771,2.5431,0.3283,0.317,4.4557,3.6939,2.9471,1.9893,5.31,0.0727,3.9144,0.0001,0.0061,0.0019,0.4449,4.3514,1.8556,4.4951,2.2851,1.4656,0.7021,3.6231,4.9454,2.5441,4.0698,0.4827,0.5719,1.4184,2.0064,2.887,0.6734,0.7004,0.012,3.832,0.3027,1.5338,2.3231,0.6493,4.187,4.4291,2.7855,5.7058,0.8974,1.1264,0.0002,7.3904,0.0529,0.0057,0.0072,1.4064,4.0918,0.3705,1.5479,0.4569,5.8004,0.4765,2.1339,0.5249,0.9186,2.8733,0.0092,0.4262,0.0852,1.8784,3.3612,1.3323,1.4659,4.8312,0.0831,1.633,1.5654,3.299,3.9476,0.8603,2.1454,0.7287,4.8121,1.529,2.8475,4.9415,0.3738,0.9919,5.8118,5.8993,3.811,1.7002,0.2632,2.3996,1.7563,5.3584,1.1757,3.0546,5.0719,4.1654,1.3116,2.6679,1.2066,6.1624,0.2127,5.2751,1.268,1.8917,3.5175,0.0499,1.6536,2.7543,1.9023,2.5896,1.4432,2.8106,1.5097,2.5693,0.7667,4.6361,1.1367,6.0382,0.3062,1.19,0.0001,3.5241,0.3975,3.7376,1.7407,1.041,0.2565,0.004,1.7689,0.358,2.6331,1.4133,4.0597,2.2513,3.303,0.0063,2.0433,4.2752,0.4263,2.8411,3.3045,0.2153,2.6479,0.262,2.2577,3.4114,3.7142,3.9013,1.3436,3.2198,0.6599,1.0388,0.4412,0.8821,2.5084,2.4687,0.0261,0.7056,0.0002,0.0029,0.0009,2.6696,1.5566,3.2807,1.6346,0.4574,0.093,2.394,4.9069,0.0199,2.976,5.5354,0.2006,1.2428,1.9283,3.1277,0.3235,1.3898,1.2515,0.1829,0.055,6.0448,3.7209,2.9367,1.501,1.5512,2.9181,0.0044,2.065,6.031,0.5649,2.3959,1.8656,0.151,0.9916,2.1277,2.8264,0.3001,6.3617,1.2973,1.6368,0.5502,0.9045,0.2664,2.0693,5.5194,5.834,0.4179,0.1576,5.0005,1.2509,5.6027,4.0987,5.456,0.1764,5.1719,0.0229,0.001,1.0221,2.2881,4.1158,3.6468,0.013,3.1268,1.555,1.814,1.0996,0.0002,2.9154,0.0057,0.0068,0.0024,1.0714,3.2539,2.5251,1.6092,1.5836,3.6602,3.9833,0.5724,4.1858,2.7017,0.0524,0.9793,0.1695,2.2371,2.8623,6.1714,3.6823,0.1153,5.0695,2.3422,3.4903,4.7487,1.3167,5.8487,2.2351,0.0434,3.7638,1.5546,3.6949,0.3299,1.5228,3.9697,0.8293,0.8443,1.6848,0.2437,0.2602,6.1419,0.0033,3.428,0.0597,5.1143,5.2,4.4155,1.1813,0.359,4.2646,0.3227,3.795,3.1272,1.0092,0.4446,0.2553,5.6447,0.0251,1.4525,3.8146,0.0122,0.418,0.7763,0.9092,0.0486,5.1186,0.2211,5.4381,0.0359,0.0023,0.0014,1.0949,3.4453,5.5438,2.8578,1.5472,3.0349,1.0081,3.2566,4.5323,1.0481,3.9723,4.6054,3.7738,2.509,0.1727,4.5807,0.8132,2.7918,2.0431,3.1204,1.1642,5.008,0.0012,0.0022,0.0008,1.6999,0.703,1.5596,0.0522,2.3393,3.8481,0.3905,0.5187,1.6551,4.1856,2.1818,1.8988,3.5246,2.5566,2.1732,0.8088,0.8265,3.7126,4.5228,0.432,2.1418,3.8717,4.666,0.7505,5.502,0.8494,0.8514,5.2458,2.5361,0.0014,0.5279,4.4537,1.2944,4.113,1.3756,5.0463,3.9907,0.0013,3.9695,0.3041,0.6566,3.6626,3.7053,2.8314,1.658,4.5197,1.604,4.9121,0.1592,3.2733,1.2693,5.2537,1.5042,0.1037,5.023,1.4251,5.4164,4.0132,0.4245,0.7241,0.0001,0.0021,0.0008,1.6318,1.6316,0.0073,5.4816,1.1658,0.3923,1.3666,1.5901,2.8134,0.9705,2.9664,1.0874,3.2712,0.6263,1.7657,1.813,3.026,0.7618,3.6479,1.2506,2.9787,0.8268,4.9339,0.6343,0.6525,3.0051,1.3088,3.6382,0.6475,0.7783,0.0002,6.0932,0.9214]}
{"id":607,"ended":true,"length":610,"gen_text":"Tennyson penned `` Ulysses `` after the death of his close Cambridge friend, the poet Arthur Henry Hallam ( 1811 \u2013 1833 ), with whom Tennyson had a strong emotional bond. The next year William Tynessey (1841 \u2013 1895 ) wrote the fourth novel, his last in England with English novelist and author Elizabeth Tennyson.\n\nWilliam Tennyson's poem, '' Ulysses, '' is an interlocking history of personal struggles and personal triumphs. In his book, the book explores struggles for justice, and the fight he fought to free himself from the brutal power of religion and the belief that all men are created equal. This book will leave no room for any self-loathing; for it will reveal for us what we are. It would be such a shame to miss it any further.\"\n\nTynessey was the first English author to be the first female Indian poet laureate of any sort, and Tennessee's influence was especially impressive in terms of literary and political development. She wrote poetry, and there are many reasons why Tennessee's influence on modern American poetry could have been very positive.\n\nWhile there may be some parallels in Tennessee's writing and voice to those of her later poems, the real inspiration lies in her work as well.\n\nThe most famous woman in South Asian history, Tennyson was also the first person, by most accounts, to co-write a best-selling literary works. At the time, the English language was still very much a very traditional language; there were few other translations of English spoken into Asia. The two major sources of English literature -- that of ancient Chinese poetry and literature and poetry-novels that were popular with the West from China - were, then and now the sole cultural hubs of Chinese culture and their cultural centers.\n\nTennyson is the only female poet laureate in the South Asian world in the last century of Chinese literary history (1750 - 1860), and yet she also penned the most well known American literary works ever. Her literary legacy was celebrated in many different communities including the United States, including the United Methodist Church, the Jewish community, and others.\n\nShe's dedicated poetry works not just to Tennyson's work on the language, but also in her relationship with her parents (and her sister's father) as well, and is also the one person who knows a lot about writing from her work. Her parents had a tremendous influence on her being able to express her ideas and make them into poems. The poem is more than just a poem, she's her writing. This poem is something that transcends race, ethnicity, class, sex, gender and so on.\n\nTennyson is one of many writers and scholars of language, history and culture whose poems transcend the stereotypes of a very particular period, all of which we've discussed previously. Her poetry is not just a statement on racial prejudice, but one of many poetry-writing-literary journeys to a higher place.\n\nI will be releasing a short biography of a poet in our next issue in the November issue of the Journal of Asian American Poetry (the publication of American Poetry Studies, vol. 6, no. (2000) in American Literary Studies Section at the University of California Press).","token_len":664,"entropy":[9.6754,10.405,12.0228,12.7301,4.0303,0.0007,4.327,4.9147,1.2629,3.1887,0.0476,1.9894,6.7361,15.0432,0.5797,0.8208,3.6124,2.8599,5.2975,6.5833,8.4314,7.0855,4.3255,7.4931,3.9548,3.5558,1.5502,4.9425,1.3386,4.8674,0.5379,8.2778,0.0018,1.3525,1.8022,5.1724,6.0763,1.0933,0.6079,2.4942,5.8927,0.9061,6.0267,5.392,4.7196,6.2286,1.8711,0.5543,4.7015,0.2048,4.2063,3.7353,2.4593,2.4165,5.5946,2.0046,0.8898,5.7001,2.1768,2.6103,4.2501,4.9863,5.3291,4.5479,2.7242,3.3694,5.3372,4.0215,0.0016,0.7762,2.4722,0.0802,3.6189,1.065,0.0017,2.0572,4.9827,1.6299,1.6496,2.3831,0.0125,0.0007,2.9978,4.3817,1.6841,3.2652,5.102,2.7593,5.9566,0.2515,5.317,3.2449,1.0885,2.8003,1.4333,0.1651,1.3815,3.1206,2.8723,4.6965,0.6905,2.6723,5.0213,4.4095,6.73,2.314,2.8118,0.8579,4.3816,1.9195,5.721,7.3204,1.5811,1.297,3.4931,2.1739,0.3447,1.3113,5.3308,4.3876,0.197,5.0902,1.6086,1.5315,5.7944,0.9001,3.2158,1.3071,0.4256,0.6289,0.0491,0.4486,4.2832,2.5284,3.8211,4.7391,2.5314,2.4591,0.0727,3.6591,5.5686,0.0838,3.4424,0.0002,4.7304,2.5636,1.8058,1.3066,4.2427,5.7398,1.537,2.1485,2.9551,2.208,3.1583,1.9052,5.1403,0.9886,5.7121,0.2587,2.4583,0.8958,4.3486,1.9994,6.1391,1.9428,2.7535,0.7292,0.0005,4.7996,1.7082,0.0138,2.5773,2.97,1.444,1.9583,2.0267,0.2654,2.6893,5.4477,1.957,4.1257,5.6484,2.0019,0.3319,2.455,3.4793,2.442,1.4108,0.9181,6.2733,1.577,5.1148,2.1349,4.9935,5.4264,2.2947,4.8084,0.0022,4.0508,3.4917,1.5791,4.128,0.3056,2.6095,2.6047,2.854,3.104,2.6285,5.3915,1.1536,1.2738,4.2402,1.4022,3.9843,1.5035,2.2858,1.6033,3.9372,2.0313,1.0346,3.2124,2.0842,0.5354,4.356,4.4706,0.3178,0.9915,0.0002,5.6816,3.7768,3.6861,0.7473,1.7841,3.537,3.0586,2.6921,0.1943,2.9369,2.2264,5.5759,1.3834,2.9513,0.1836,2.7201,5.6422,3.4911,0.2097,2.158,4.8951,3.0753,3.781,0.5862,0.8851,4.564,1.601,2.1835,0.7773,2.2373,0.0001,3.09,4.2946,2.5353,4.9824,1.471,6.1204,3.4333,2.2823,1.1389,2.0034,0.0016,1.1307,3.7645,1.3487,0.6637,3.4215,4.3179,3.84,4.2278,0.2605,0.0594,0.0987,6.1457,0.0927,0.6963,1.1016,5.8353,0.8528,0.3665,4.6901,4.8571,1.4553,5.4218,0.5317,0.9721,0.8506,2.5485,4.1643,2.4728,0.3536,2.6223,2.8984,0.4776,1.4523,3.5764,4.921,0.6463,4.0808,3.3928,0.7969,2.5076,4.1297,5.0731,0.487,1.9121,3.5242,5.9499,2.739,1.1394,2.8321,5.4923,3.9745,3.7176,0.4137,1.5101,1.5696,6.35,5.425,0.1589,5.4862,1.9891,3.1425,0.4088,4.7662,3.3339,1.9533,5.2616,4.55,0.1095,0.6014,3.5963,1.8049,3.4024,2.5127,1.0097,2.9992,5.0893,3.4141,4.6562,0.4488,4.6649,5.3926,2.7985,1.1005,6.6988,5.7401,5.1447,5.5369,0.7118,4.0574,1.1004,2.4623,5.3764,3.5223,4.5936,0.5292,0.5366,0.0002,1.356,0.0019,3.8889,2.7738,1.4136,2.6544,1.9119,0.0486,1.4974,1.2241,3.8684,0.0819,1.255,4.214,1.181,1.7602,2.564,3.5281,3.9265,4.454,0.2475,3.5514,4.8716,2.6816,1.9866,3.902,1.2477,0.7545,5.1422,1.3266,3.9802,4.4453,2.8255,1.2839,4.1916,2.0549,5.2531,2.4197,0.807,4.5761,1.5291,2.8311,4.3919,2.3539,2.7133,5.4637,1.6358,2.6686,2.7254,6.2766,3.8448,1.5899,1.5263,0.0097,0.5366,4.7034,1.5685,2.2471,5.7003,0.2072,0.7583,1.1075,5.4218,1.2735,1.0785,0.7742,5.1531,0.245,0.7224,0.0002,4.0414,4.8163,6.0219,5.6189,6.2091,5.9171,1.8543,0.0556,3.1981,0.0005,1.7241,1.4001,2.6641,1.5806,4.933,0.8643,0.0986,0.9949,4.0002,1.27,6.0822,0.6273,1.6942,4.6784,3.3181,2.7611,2.4951,3.9238,2.2529,2.841,1.4043,3.1315,0.084,2.7954,1.6123,3.462,2.668,1.9004,4.9427,2.9382,1.1192,5.1518,3.5035,1.2433,0.2745,3.354,3.4238,1.8018,4.9138,1.0491,3.2016,4.711,3.4526,1.7306,5.905,0.4589,0.2124,0.6953,5.6661,1.4639,0.0064,4.2023,0.9105,2.6941,1.198,4.7961,1.0434,1.5283,1.3389,0.8178,3.5602,4.2794,2.3896,5.3576,0.6225,1.045,0.6766,1.1623,1.1976,3.3973,1.2128,4.7855,4.8687,0.9839,4.2811,2.6753,0.9345,4.4735,0.9297,2.8921,0.0368,4.0618,0.7787,3.2695,0.1375,1.6192,0.158,3.8314,0.168,2.4564,1.928,2.8835,0.8391,0.3056,0.903,0.0002,1.0391,0.0028,1.9607,2.8581,0.0413,3.2465,2.8725,2.2843,4.1786,2.5891,5.5307,1.9085,3.2425,0.7291,1.3414,4.0991,3.7855,5.1211,1.6547,4.9614,1.1155,3.919,5.252,3.35,3.6973,2.7474,6.0447,1.2565,0.2715,4.1604,3.1977,4.0603,3.8826,0.311,3.0351,1.8194,1.0948,2.4555,1.1065,1.2832,4.5664,2.7461,4.6123,4.1957,0.9681,0.8133,3.9796,1.4475,3.4966,5.089,2.6808,2.6189,4.4583,3.3272,0.9426,6.116,3.6403,2.7349,3.8005,1.8776,0.7117,0.7387,0.0002,4.1213,3.971,2.0937,5.3677,1.1974,2.9864,2.9653,0.3743,5.5626,2.3857,2.7455,4.632,2.2235,1.1597,4.3964,2.0547,4.542,0.3011,0.3707,1.9385,3.3861,0.1578,1.5341,0.7698,2.4777,0.1013,3.17,4.5285,4.2062,0.6644,4.9158,0.486,0.2269,4.8973,1.8567,5.1022,0.1079,3.2901,0.5792,0.8727,0.0066,8.013,4.9307,1.2272,4.1018,5.7358,6.5015,1.0091,6.6901,3.9017,0.9568,0.5389,0.0083,1.5831,1.4449,1.056]}

{"id":4266,"ended":true,"length":575,"gen_text":"If investigations confirm NSCLC, the stage is assessed to determine whether the disease is localized and amenable to surgery or if it has spread to the point where it can not be cured surgically.\n\nIt was in the year 2000 that NSCLC was identified by the Department of Internal Medicine and Health Services' Pathology Surveillance Group.\n\nWhile the case in question was not a known virus, the new data showed that it is now thought to be related to polio, and that it was spread to multiple nations in the west.\n\nA 2011 study looked at 1,000 cases but found that the new infections did not have an association with the two major pathogens: polio.\n\nA 2008 study on 80 cases but found that polio was associated with about 10 percent of the cases, which led to one of the last confirmed cases being found in 2010.\n\nNSCLC is a highly contagious disease with little clinical data. But recent evidence indicates it can cause severe illnesses and is potentially life-threatening. It can also produce a serious neurological and neurological sequelae such as learning disabilities.\n\n\"This latest work provides good news, but not a great change in policy. A major challenge for the State of Louisiana, however, is to identify cases of polio that have never been recorded before,\" said Dr. Michael C. E. O'Neil, the Department of Public Health Health and Mental Hygiene chief of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \"In addition to establishing the appropriate procedures and screening of cases, we need to determine whether or not that the virus is also present in the community.\"\n\nThe CDC and state medical-aid systems have been scrambling to find out how NSCLC affected individuals and communities. The agency is expected to unveil a final analysis in April.\n\n\"Today is the day when we need to have an entire state on board with that approach,\" Dr. E. F. Shorter, a University of Louisiana at Lafayette researcher with the NSCLC team, said. \"In our view it is premature to think about when it is going to be available to any community or community. We are going to look at, what do we know from this new information, what the risks of it are, what steps might make or risk doing something that is even more risky.\"\n\n###\n\nUniversity of Texas Health Science Center is one of the nation's premier state-of-the-art medical schools.

{"id":1064,"ended":false,"length":630,"gen_text":"On July 1, David F. Tufaro, a real estate developer and lawyer from Roland Park, Maryland, announced his intention to run for the Republican Party nomination, joining three neighborhood activists, including three young adults in the neighborhood who were walking on the park benches to support his primary opponent. In November, he announced that he was running to replace former Gov. Martin O'Malley as mayor of Baltimore's North West Baltimore district.\n\nMayor Thomas J. G. Brown and others say the election to Congress has been contentious and that he might have to step down. However, it is easy to see the race as a turning point for the candidate with the largest crowds in Baltimore.\n\nA recent poll conducted by the Maryland Center for Public Affairs Research. In a separate poll the same day, an online online poll by Real Clear Politics found 59 percent of respondents say that they will vote in the Democratic primary for Mr. Brown (36 percent said he would make the party's nominating ballot).\n\nIn late May, Mayor Michael S. O'Malley, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said that while he supports a Democratic candidate in the presidential election in November, he and Mr. Brown \"have to make a call to voters who are concerned about future generations' legacy.\"\n\nSome advocates say the primary election will help give the party some momentum. The Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., said:\n\n\"The fight is over, there are the voters, and we need political movements that we can work towards that make life more perfect for all people. The people are up in arms. And that's where I think this race for mayor can be most effective.\"\n\nHe also said that if he runs, \"I can say that it will give me a chance to be elected mayor of Baltimore.\"\n\nMany Democrats have been considering the option of joining him in the race for a third term if the race goes to the final round. At this time, though, there is not a party that says winning the nomination is too close to calling.\n\nA new report indicates that Democrats are still mulling whether or not to run candidates for statewide office, with about one month until the general election.\n\nOn March 23, Senator Al S. Franken of Minnesota proposed eliminating the \"one Democratic, two Republican, and one Libertarian standard\" from his term-limited slate of 50 state representatives. Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, on the other hand, announced plans to run in the Feb. 2 primary in Indiana.\n\nIn a message to supporters, he noted that \"I am a man of conscience.\"\n\n\"I am proud of my long run and I will always be a man of conviction and I am doing my best for our city and my people. We have always had a shared vision, a shared vision for our city,\" he proclaimed.\n\n\"A vision for New York City,\" he continues, \"that we are a city that does not want new immigrants, new jobs and better lives for New Yorkers, who are in the midst of a historic recovery and a new vision for the future for our city.

{"id":3677,"ended":true,"length":594,"gen_text":"On the eve of World War II, UBS was the recipient of a large influx of foreign funds for safekeeping. During the war, the bank's traditional business fell off and the bank's business was in the hands of those who worked with the German government to keep its money safe and secure. By the middle of 1956, the bank's balance sheet had been depleted and could no longer keep up with the demands.\nWith this situation, UBS's management and financial position were threatened. The government decided on the plan to have UBS permanently closed and then give up controlling foreign funds for new operations or to have the bank continue with the use of its own funds to pay legal expenses.\nWith the help of international businessmen, United States regulators gave UBS the green light to use any or all of its money. As a result, the bank's legal assets were confiscated, which was further used against UBS. In a bid to make the situation easier to manage, the U.S. government placed an emergency order in October 1954 to remove UBS. The government subsequently imposed the price cut.\nWhile the bank was still in hiding, the U.S. Federal Reserve and World War II intelligence were not enough to prevent the American government from destroying the bank. In 1956, President Eisenhower asked the State Department to assist in closing the UBS banking system because the U.S. government was violating U.S. law against money laundering, which was a violation of the Anti-Money Laundering Law.\nIn February 1955, the U.S. Government seized American money after three separate reports revealed that U.S. officials had laundered $500 million in illegal money from Germany using U.S. money laundered in other countries. In February 1956, Germany had been caught giving cash to Communist parties in a country known as the 'Cadillac of Central Europe'that was not the'Soviet Union '. The authorities arrested U.S. citizens for money laundering by the North American Central Bank during the same year.\nAs the Soviet Union collapsed after the fall of communism, the Soviet government began its final plan to confiscate UBS, which was successful until the fall of Communism.\nOn March 23, 1956, the United States revoked the U.S. banking authority as part of the Soviet Union. The Soviet government had just entered the war on several fronts. The United States stopped keeping UBS for a number of reasons. On that occasion, the Soviet government asked for UBS funds to be returned to the International Trust Company and, under the American government's leadership, it demanded this return to be used. However, the U.S. government refused this demand after UBS was declared bankrupt while the Soviet Union was bombing the Soviet Union. The two sides continued to work side by side together.\nAs soon as the U.S. government withdrew its control over the bank, UBS, UBS International and the International Trust Company (IDCT) terminated their partnership in 1962 and ceased production of its new instruments, in the following years UBS Inc. ceased to produce foreign currency in their hands. After UBS was declared bankrupt, however, the U.S. Bankers Association (BGA) and some private-sector lenders continued selling off bank assets and selling off UBS to private investors.","token_len":672,"entropy":[2.6156,5.2338,0.0074,5.6626,0.2818,0.5027,0.1232,4.9734,8.4379,2.8048,2.8165,5.7652,0.0073,1.4916,5.2288,6.5461,0.0254,2.4168,4.0843,3.2342,10.8622,0.1753,1.6141,4.638,1.0023,1.1085,0.2409,1.5678,2.708,2.3937,8.618,3.8964,6.0581,4.0761,2.8391,1.8554,1.7984,1.7769,4.5223,2.2115,3.778,1.8617,1.6139,0.0011,5.5374,0.7049,4.4566,2.5522,1.4202,3.3824,1.3779,2.3738,2.9207,3.0248,3.2795,0.8578,2.6956,1.7186,0.2227,4.2083,1.0984,5.0935,0.0175,6.8802,0.2106,1.343,0.6608,2.0626,3.3652,0.2302,0.9053,1.5824,2.1874,1.3442,6.9447,0.443,0.001,2.2441,1.026,0.2012,0.9224,2.9426,4.9505,1.4027,11.8712,3.9811,3.9718,1.5082,0.9546,0.004,3.3558,4.3852,3.7945,2.9802,3.2968,1.1099,3.732,0.4221,2.1003,3.9062,3.21,4.7528,2.2582,4.1922,0.5325,4.6326,0.8131,0.0065,4.8863,1.772,2.133,4.4559,5.3437,1.5567,5.8468,5.6347,2.6281,2.4486,6.5358,3.0698,4.5564,1.5687,4.3392,1.7388,0.4076,3.9759,3.9724,2.131,5.2316,0.0294,1.9035,2.4727,1.6983,2.6839,2.2263,6.158,3.0762,0.5608,1.6868,3.5474,1.0388,4.3753,0.0124,4.1827,5.6391,0.9228,6.1832,0.9615,4.8623,6.1051,0.8032,0.0021,1.6886,1.6105,0.0094,0.3126,4.0604,5.5457,4.6295,0.0109,0.1774,0.2593,3.1802,3.393,3.7618,1.2197,0.1313,0.2796,1.4359,0.5631,1.8512,6.0646,4.049,0.7639,3.2618,1.9753,3.7401,2.7106,5.537,3.7989,4.4232,0.9907,0.0417,1.5729,2.5277,3.8138,3.9808,0.0116,3.9653,2.2922,1.9478,3.1208,1.1329,1.6655,0.1567,0.9562,1.6336,0.4964,0.0029,0.0143,0.9342,4.647,2.8075,3.1732,1.6958,2.0902,3.3236,3.6987,1.8568,3.9069,0.9998,0.0021,3.4598,1.837,2.9359,4.6994,3.8063,2.8835,5.706,6.5017,3.0773,0.8464,4.2137,1.0649,3.552,1.6062,1.8433,1.2097,5.7092,0.2774,1.2994,1.4709,0.0303,0.0021,0.0044,4.5085,0.1842,3.5452,4.1032,2.1193,0.0183,4.5008,4.0175,5.1619,2.972,0.1069,2.0498,0.858,6.207,1.088,0.1497,4.6165,1.0512,0.407,0.6326,2.1254,3.7113,0.1893,3.4391,0.916,3.9291,1.018,4.9978,0.1128,0.1703,4.8413,1.4371,5.4212,1.0893,1.7188,0.1936,5.0384,0.9687,4.9609,1.7187,2.1076,0.0251,0.0013,0.0018,0.5459,1.4372,5.5813,2.711,0.124,0.0353,0.0037,1.3202,3.2317,3.0039,0.1772,2.8179,2.1033,1.5242,2.5574,2.4368,0.1022,0.7688,3.8953,0.0329,0.2994,0.0061,0.0,4.1092,0.6031,1.1379,1.8902,4.1663,2.8095,0.0922,1.0183,1.3977,0.0124,0.0027,0.0024,2.6605,4.4291,5.4326,3.4746,4.7123,6.2176,3.4176,5.3939,3.2429,0.6677,1.5208,1.4297,0.0021,0.003,2.3519,0.6589,3.3675,0.003,2.2434,4.0129,0.2148,1.3986,2.7664,1.6439,1.8908,3.2577,6.4344,1.6443,0.2524,0.0023,0.1217,1.9216,2.2889,0.8811,1.8258,3.164,0.1636,0.2898,2.1389,3.2802,0.5856,0.0778,5.4244,3.6902,3.1083,3.6619,5.4533,4.7285,0.2737,5.2264,2.4023,1.3179,4.1243,4.4447,1.9999,0.2949,1.1651,4.488,4.1444,3.8469,0.9655,1.8448,2.9445,0.6231,14.5851,9.1738,4.4099,4.6434,2.7914,13.0809,7.8992,0.2809,8.4005,1.7398,5.7445,3.6934,2.7756,0.5044,0.0046,0.0234,2.8855,2.9872,1.788,0.0399,4.2235,1.832,5.8644,1.5288,3.379,0.9758,5.3719,0.8037,4.037,1.4821,0.5069,0.8201,3.8637,1.6131,3.464,0.1179,2.2512,5.3767,0.6418,1.1001,0.0174,2.411,0.5096,0.8251,3.1548,1.5117,2.4085,4.1897,5.7012,4.1957,0.4287,5.0761,0.0017,0.8213,0.6857,3.3409,1.7721,1.4841,4.9455,5.9393,1.3294,2.343,0.0082,2.6502,0.4525,1.87,4.0064,2.5337,3.3658,0.04,0.7328,0.0839,1.051,2.5729,0.0613,5.7545,1.166,1.1419,1.9505,0.0011,0.0218,2.6257,4.705,4.6367,1.7619,0.0013,1.1155,3.2028,0.6182,4.3309,1.323,3.4154,1.0143,3.3609,5.2747,5.0676,1.6826,3.2006,2.6106,5.6906,0.3706,1.2702,1.4003,2.4325,0.0133,6.3565,6.042,0.7307,0.0803,3.3822,2.1571,2.3889,0.0007,1.1542,0.8104,4.7478,5.0784,2.6999,0.0956,0.6924,1.8003,0.5213,4.5099,1.9587,1.4759,0.0867,3.5017,1.0508,0.6504,2.0729,0.4441,0.8769,6.4745,6.038,2.3717,3.1706,4.3415,3.4821,0.9993,6.1746,2.2789,0.1514,3.6177,0.0244,3.1368,4.816,4.6203,2.7559,2.8416,2.7802,3.9303,3.9844,3.2419,0.005,1.3063,1.638,0.0053,0.0021,0.0026,0.3643,1.4254,3.1808,2.1261,5.5884,1.9437,0.2663,1.4896,4.144,2.3979,6.8503,1.1927,1.558,0.8455,0.3515,6.0878,1.252,1.3986,0.0945,0.5157,2.0351,6.3395,2.0708,2.9678,0.5463,3.0104,4.151,0.1813,0.0011,4.6187,2.165,0.8859,3.6757,4.1067,0.0025,0.5846,1.7163,0.0042,0.0011,0.0019,0.3996,5.0456,1.3983,3.3467,0.6941,1.3997,1.013,0.3912,2.0036,0.0582,4.7212,4.9157,0.3488,3.0133,1.1091,1.7386,2.7586,0.3758,0.0678,3.1823,5.3539,4.8034,1.1451,7.0337,0.9051,3.7443,2.4166,3.9333,2.1729,3.1491,6.7352,0.8638,3.738,4.8537,4.9901,2.7816,4.9298,2.9943,4.0069,1.2936,1.6709,0.0261,6.1745,0.6952,2.2377,1.682,2.4785,5.2989,1.1214,3.6802,5.1241,4.7673,0.4168,4.3077,2.3624,0.067,1.6763,2.8343,0.4135,0.7361,5.034,0.0027,0.8811,1.4959,0.0028,0.0023,0.0036,5.877,1.6938,0.3045,1.4343,0.7122,3.3466,0.1003,2.7697,4.9275,5.2425,4.9155,0.6641,4.5738,3.168,5.7119,4.4779,6.3633,0.6472,2.0703,3.4266,0.6345,1.3797,0.0698,3.3171,2.7054,1.5221,0.4365]}
{"id":178,"ended":false,"length":593,"gen_text":"The British Geological Survey ( BGS ) reported that in 2005, China was the top producer of antimony with an approximately 84 % world share, followed at a distance by South Africa, Iceland and Denmark. BGS found that in 2010, the United States recorded the most annual antimony production with an average annual rate of 1.1 BGS for the South in 2010, followed by Jamaica, Canada and Argentina with an annual rate of 1.8 BGS each. During the same decade, the US recorded an average annual rate of about 10 BGS, followed by the UK with an average annual rate of 3.7 BGS. The BGS statistics (2013: BGS and the US) have been collected on a quarterly basis for 2010 to 2013, with an average date on which they are available online. In 2011, China's annual antimony production was estimated to have reached $4.4 billion with an annual rate of around 5 BGS per year estimated to be the largest ever recorded. In 2012, the BGS figures reported here also reveal that China had recorded the largest antimony production for 2009. In addition, in 2008 alone, in China alone, total antimony production reached roughly $15.8 billion with annual totals of about $4.9 billion. Antimony production declined in 2006, while annual antimony production did increase by 5.4 kg in 2008, and by 2.1 kg in 2007. At the same time, the average antimony production for 2009 decreased by 6.1 kg for a total of $3.6. The U.S. antimony production averaged annual totals of around 7.8 BGS annually and produced about 30% of the world market per year, including nearly half of the world market for antimony, and in 2007 and 2008, $8.4 trillion worth of antimony was in the U.S. markets, up from $9 trillion in 2006. Since 1970, the world market for antimony has grown through the use of over 35 million tons of earthworms, up from 35 million tons in 1969. Antimony may be used by any type of plant or mineral in the world; it is used not only in mineral water and food, but also in fertilizer. Antimony has a protective value with respect to moisture stability, even as it is not easily lost. The earthworm counts are counted by the BGR and the average number of units per meter that are being counted has been increased to 10 units. The total number of units counted over the course of the year is 100 units with 10,000 units being counted for 2011, 2012 and 2013. The amount that is counted varies by the specific types of antitium that are used and whether they can be used without the use of herbicide or fungicides. Antitium is a compound containing a metal (usually nitric acid) that can degrade after use as it passes through the earthworms. A soil containing antitium also contains a number of metals, such as cadmium and mercury, which have a greater affinity in the earthworm cells, increasing the antimony concentration in the soil. Antitium is used in fertilizers and in many other products, including in food and fertilizer. The antitium concentration in water is one metric ton of antitium per cubic meter.\n\n1 2","token_len":672,"entropy":[7.8726,7.6647,0.0044,1.7149,5.2794,0.016,0.1731,4.4048,1.1518,3.4249,4.551,1.0057,6.6726,2.7304,0.973,4.7539,1.8674,0.1035,8.9597,2.748,4.2726,2.0691,8.3144,6.1621,4.6519,7.336,3.8581,1.8417,1.4802,6.8562,1.2975,5.6615,1.5412,3.1021,1.6285,1.7334,5.6951,0.8821,3.5889,0.436,5.6207,0.0398,4.0251,0.2767,1.6236,2.8516,0.4282,1.9825,3.4817,0.2363,4.1476,1.6502,3.6371,4.5457,0.9282,0.0048,0.5177,3.7637,0.9883,2.3897,1.9592,3.4801,0.0213,3.0351,0.3194,3.2879,5.6789,1.3087,4.1388,1.651,4.7232,4.9076,1.2063,1.4341,1.4123,0.1657,6.163,1.5111,3.4375,1.0028,4.2192,2.3498,1.6148,1.9564,0.1398,0.0366,1.1734,0.0233,2.6112,0.2418,0.0006,2.6022,0.4094,5.9067,1.0596,0.697,4.4778,0.1702,1.2991,3.6565,0.5942,2.5966,1.108,0.3567,0.8037,0.0091,4.4422,4.386,0.5205,0.0007,2.1782,0.5117,0.0294,2.4691,1.099,0.8209,0.3711,0.8324,0.3305,0.0075,0.0168,2.8962,0.147,2.2381,0.1285,0.0003,0.6447,2.1012,2.7447,0.0049,5.554,5.6155,5.0409,4.7945,2.4084,0.0134,3.9406,3.2345,2.7339,1.3125,4.0131,0.5136,5.1043,3.9474,1.5198,2.8624,0.0091,2.2993,5.6331,3.7313,1.5435,1.9258,2.4456,3.0857,1.4279,5.7621,5.0664,1.3132,1.9492,0.7743,0.9906,5.2007,0.5875,3.5063,3.3322,0.3338,3.8344,2.8531,1.9546,0.8823,0.0026,0.114,0.9778,2.0787,1.0476,1.9888,1.3588,3.8521,3.3276,0.2716,2.5118,0.3738,4.0207,0.5352,0.8805,0.5676,0.0378,4.5897,3.1606,1.6993,0.001,2.6218,0.5188,7.8888,0.9159,0.4363,3.1126,2.6531,2.6885,0.4905,0.9757,2.3958,1.4338,0.1437,1.1362,1.7007,0.0018,3.7782,3.4348,6.5399,3.8785,4.563,0.6302,0.9718,2.948,3.1302,1.5524,1.0368,1.6322,0.0035,0.1921,3.1479,4.7937,2.3288,2.0088,3.0468,0.5198,1.7459,3.1749,6.1242,0.238,5.1536,1.8338,2.886,0.3589,5.5841,0.5008,0.0013,0.1114,1.7881,6.4363,0.5946,4.4098,1.1243,2.3335,0.0927,2.1536,5.1977,5.0696,0.9901,1.9143,0.1102,3.1971,0.1695,2.755,0.0674,0.5716,4.0652,0.014,0.749,4.9278,1.5685,5.1476,1.4544,4.2384,4.1551,1.4797,0.0013,0.1992,5.0878,1.8557,3.6081,4.4212,0.6645,2.2169,6.9424,1.9577,2.5231,1.4403,2.1747,1.4543,2.2412,0.074,2.3295,0.0417,0.1135,0.8034,0.4297,4.9125,0.6892,0.6054,0.0075,0.0761,1.503,3.6421,2.3557,0.0015,0.4212,1.3027,1.7942,3.9965,0.5863,3.342,0.2944,2.1726,0.1079,3.7582,2.4297,0.5176,0.4917,1.5341,2.7189,0.0321,2.4498,6.1456,2.0609,5.0547,0.0128,0.0734,0.0813,1.2187,0.0021,0.2218,5.8723,5.7187,3.3503,0.3184,2.8908,4.8514,0.4674,2.4092,1.3549,0.0024,3.5801,3.0766,5.1026,2.2035,4.9446,2.9956,0.1675,0.5749,0.4842,5.0191,4.9316,0.1584,1.9613,5.3222,4.6451,2.2861,0.3623,0.6961,1.2489,0.7315,0.7424,1.1568,0.0034,2.7939,2.389,4.2603,3.5403,3.3784,0.2086,0.8825,5.0657,3.4949,0.2566,2.1479,3.8999,2.3505,0.0386,1.4861,0.0015,0.2933,5.3673,0.7711,1.5774,0.0004,0.0003,0.1537,6.1801,1.9381,3.8948,0.654,0.9412,2.6867,2.3465,0.5997,1.7027,0.4769,5.0319,5.6138,0.1441,1.0362,3.0805,2.1291,0.2401,0.1327,0.0011,0.3057,1.556,6.0019,1.8353,1.3432,0.0454,5.405,5.1471,2.2674,1.4557,0.1247,5.3165,2.2337,1.2928,3.953,0.2721,4.9531,0.1793,0.0718,0.0999,3.0392,0.7976,2.5735,0.0064,6.4058,0.806,1.5344,3.5944,5.1931,3.495,0.0156,2.864,1.6796,4.7072,2.9733,1.3874,0.6615,4.9076,1.7864,0.7253,1.8718,5.9404,0.065,1.2376,5.352,5.3962,2.1769,3.8157,1.3191,0.1625,0.2601,0.5262,4.4992,2.971,1.9327,0.0046,2.9333,2.2406,5.7445,3.3585,4.9518,2.2755,0.0021,4.1239,5.5464,1.1056,5.9721,4.5696,0.5401,1.0953,3.954,3.7651,5.7571,1.2969,2.077,4.981,0.4054,6.1753,2.2722,4.7911,2.4551,1.5316,3.7212,6.4104,2.5821,2.1049,5.1118,2.5542,0.1027,4.7149,2.5909,3.671,4.3834,1.7505,4.9727,2.4192,4.1612,0.6856,2.822,2.0507,3.6997,1.8906,1.9936,1.4514,3.2586,1.0364,0.0133,0.7774,2.7619,5.8059,1.1559,2.5512,0.0006,1.365,0.2846,0.9533,5.2368,1.6188,4.5481,4.249,3.4248,0.2453,0.3288,1.0495,0.3858,1.9857,5.3577,1.9826,3.6825,0.4443,0.0796,0.2775,1.4653,4.2395,4.0821,0.7126,0.9733,4.1314,1.7484,2.2266,5.1774,5.2535,0.0485,11.3915,5.8707,2.765,0.5672,1.0279,2.3358,3.9263,2.1013,4.1907,0.1409,1.5226,4.7224,2.4458,0.6566,0.0132,4.9373,2.9284,1.8758,2.2999,0.6741,0.2475,2.0084,5.8718,0.1153,1.2267,2.2581,3.6281,3.8931,2.1087,4.9453,4.5983,3.5002,5.3423,1.2428,0.6838,0.2415,1.2053,2.7199,5.114,5.2739,2.2998,3.5174,1.1366,4.1138,0.0886,0.9299,2.768,4.2083,0.8996,4.0985,4.6094,3.5458,5.5827,0.0338,5.1233,1.2919,1.9935,3.2914,0.0084,3.7323,1.3613,1.6395,0.004,3.6369,0.0006,0.0,1.4538,3.1885,0.9187,1.0766,3.3012,1.6482,4.5437,3.0242,4.999,1.0906,1.8185,0.4422,5.1487,3.0664,4.8846,0.8959,2.429,0.6662,2.1479,1.9708,0.3461,0.234,0.3647,1.3979,0.3471,0.0113,1.1346,2.5383,1.0955,3.0031,0.3515,1.4691,2.0779,3.3931,0.9741,2.2801,1.8481,0.9118,3.3407,3.6383,1.5155,3.4957,0.5177,1.9535,6.5312,0.0582,2.5581,1.2158,4.0053,1.0128,4.7451,5.6599,1.3048,2.8665,2.8871,0.0838,2.2613,1.6365,0.2574,1.5763,3.7266,0.0056,4.771,4.1172]}

She also played a small role in \"The One Where Everything Comes Back: The Best Friends Season Two\" in which she starred with Chris Redfield and Mike Dunleavy, which she was also on the panel for.\n\nSee also","token_len":675,"entropy":[8.8575,4.2568,2.1355,8.9898,0.8919,4.0374,10.2209,17.2668,10.3794,6.6304,6.779,4.516,3.9539,1.5416,5.131,5.6894,4.6637,4.5806,5.8965,1.7136,7.3792,5.6212,3.7969,4.9586,0.8974,0.5695,1.4576,4.6715,0.5957,5.1312,5.2212,1.1982,2.4697,2.6548,0.4951,0.3639,4.9975,5.1067,5.603,4.7174,0.6745,5.3951,4.6465,4.7652,4.0162,5.5252,3.3107,2.3755,3.319,6.1162,5.9518,5.8903,2.1703,3.754,4.5684,3.5361,4.152,1.688,4.7987,4.4685,1.255,4.5929,0.6782,3.4536,3.1991,4.1271,3.6493,3.6202,0.255,5.9812,5.0913,5.0951,1.7512,1.4558,6.206,0.6823,5.4044,0.1213,2.8063,1.9363,3.9847,7.0322,0.2536,1.5503,5.3455,1.4147,1.2421,1.8992,3.8711,2.9442,2.3382,3.6839,0.2653,5.7569,2.8896,0.144,1.242,3.38,2.6119,2.458,5.758,1.193,1.6468,1.28,3.1884,3.1946,0.781,2.3308,0.1499,1.6868,6.1099,0.1673,0.7273,1.7412,0.6736,1.7069,6.1602,3.4093,1.7942,5.7575,0.8208,1.0078,2.3529,1.5618,0.434,1.9207,2.0689,5.9672,4.2753,4.0527,1.5163,0.0395,2.0297,2.4495,1.0109,2.6647,1.3036,1.5847,0.2309,4.065,6.0616,3.7996,5.3491,4.6579,1.4834,3.6031,0.5181,0.3876,1.5854,5.1881,0.6111,4.0819,0.0288,0.7564,0.0,3.7102,0.2877,1.8928,4.9203,0.075,1.7473,5.0371,2.2555,0.8658,1.2747,0.0398,0.3073,0.0,1.5509,1.9655,5.8003,1.046,6.8346,3.2079,5.9115,1.9468,1.3142,3.3156,3.2487,5.8414,3.9135,2.8636,4.4169,0.0018,5.0858,4.2569,0.6537,1.9325,1.8479,5.5018,3.1086,5.4164,1.7971,1.1175,3.1093,3.6581,5.9524,3.5373,1.8105,4.8206,1.9115,2.5171,1.1834,1.1714,2.2705,0.5459,2.9149,2.5057,4.5144,1.8695,0.0239,1.8894,3.133,5.9706,6.6946,3.8635,0.1152,0.1878,0.0003,1.3438,0.9071,4.462,1.3319,1.0118,0.0119,5.4948,4.2616,2.8005,4.6436,0.2945,0.9262,0.6665,2.3325,3.4355,3.5365,2.4489,4.1878,5.0216,0.8682,2.8676,0.2171,6.1189,1.0379,0.2092,0.0,0.0001,2.5576,4.026,4.5961,0.9726,4.8907,2.0932,2.8205,4.9802,4.613,1.6677,4.3551,3.784,2.7493,0.5237,0.4222,0.4523,6.0025,3.0562,0.6286,1.3631,2.2113,3.3813,1.7237,2.1139,2.1114,5.2059,0.0513,1.8347,0.1163,2.7268,0.8287,0.0002,3.0663,4.1232,5.5269,1.2726,1.8308,3.6219,1.3217,3.1793,4.9109,4.8286,3.7824,2.5267,0.961,3.7833,4.3601,5.9952,0.5129,3.2082,0.0708,0.2054,5.4463,0.1236,4.8435,0.5834,4.6124,0.0006,4.915,1.569,4.0733,2.9545,1.4957,0.4455,0.5007,0.0003,2.1847,3.7491,1.5046,2.419,0.6567,4.7585,1.7023,0.5992,1.6318,2.3357,5.9707,3.0093,3.7414,4.0186,1.8536,2.0116,1.895,6.4463,3.4868,0.0369,5.2189,5.4678,3.1541,0.003,0.0,0.7976,5.8131,2.161,1.7206,0.8801,2.014,4.9562,5.2129,1.7777,2.0274,1.2268,4.338,1.1991,5.0203,5.7275,3.1616,0.6727,0.4561,1.8351,3.2573,5.301,1.9803,2.3561,0.5642,0.6803,3.3987,4.6799,4.8627,0.8781,4.8268,0.1927,0.1445,3.4177,3.072,1.4183,0.0069,1.6754,3.9746,1.3043,4.1822,5.1964,1.2645,1.8448,5.1305,3.0039,3.6287,4.2979,6.0256,1.1133,0.0006,3.7824,2.6422,3.0941,1.762,0.3636,2.4289,0.5354,1.2226,2.4756,4.8323,5.505,1.2412,2.7506,0.1388,3.8635,0.3563,0.3687,4.0165,0.0066,1.573,0.131,3.0908,1.3852,2.3423,3.3861,4.3838,0.0173,0.0343,4.635,1.4759,4.4963,2.6754,3.7727,2.4497,3.1465,4.8777,0.3787,4.1218,5.041,0.8799,0.5159,1.4588,3.0212,1.6157,5.1631,2.9572,0.517,3.9102,4.4365,4.521,0.3096,5.0985,0.3235,2.3868,0.3324,1.145,5.61,5.7593,2.3198,5.4852,1.6631,3.7428,4.6335,2.6681,4.6135,5.1302,0.0064,5.5005,0.2994,1.7075,1.2787,0.1532,3.0037,5.5888,0.1189,1.032,3.792,0.3046,0.0034,1.4939,1.5898,0.0036,4.582,0.0175,3.429,1.5894,4.2382,4.0428,3.8195,4.3546,3.9899,0.4431,5.5748,6.5185,6.6634,2.6414,1.2894,6.0697,1.1332,3.9846,1.264,1.5935,1.8111,1.3134,0.8916,5.3965,0.7207,4.6037,1.1328,1.4477,2.2386,5.9474,0.4284,1.7647,2.7329,0.6445,1.2552,0.0003,2.1349,6.054,2.9414,1.0874,3.358,1.9011,0.5159,1.2494,4.9877,3.0932,0.7983,4.1527,4.0142,1.102,0.4654,1.5784,0.8913,1.415,2.2039,0.1525,2.2396,2.6718,0.054,5.4749,3.2708,3.7483,1.9679,2.8971,3.1697,0.2241,5.9938,0.7914,5.1005,6.7209,0.0413,3.7006,6.4716,3.9017,4.583,2.8087,5.3526,5.0118,1.336,0.1249,0.0001,4.5656,5.75,1.6663,0.0,0.8776,1.9158,1.1464,1.1845,5.0701,0.2321,5.2166,2.6419,0.75,2.2302,6.786,0.937,0.071,0.8913,2.6798,0.029,3.7081,0.0754,0.0022,0.0009,0.8012,0.9763,0.0002,1.0208,3.0776,0.8818,0.3949,2.7859,0.3083,0.7739,4.9069,5.2876,2.7752,0.4874,1.1141,5.7681,2.0052,4.5586,5.6951,4.2712,0.6161,3.4437,3.1162,0.0,1.726,4.6219,3.2095,1.7964,4.7029,1.5765,5.1245,1.7303,4.6745,3.7986,0.35,3.1618,2.6922,0.5338,2.6596,0.9168,3.677,1.3664,1.0308,4.1188,3.7032,3.4025,4.0199,0.1687,0.132,0.2127,0.01,4.7936,1.4898,0.6871,3.0537,1.6941,4.6141,0.6452,0.2268,3.3351,1.5075,2.6626,0.3333,0.3578,0.2088,0.0195,4.0728,1.5491,4.54,1.1422,5.6209,3.2478,1.0068,2.2292,0.1646,0.151,3.6864,3.6755,4.3101,5.577,0.0232,1.5172,5.1433,5.4969,0.7177,0.001,2.113,3.6216,2.7541,3.2655,1.3485,4.3682,1.2816,4.6,2.2217,0.4565,1.0073,0.0002,6.9796,0.5591]}
{"id":3616,"ended":true,"length":583,"gen_text":"Salvia researcher Griffith said that from animal testing salvia appears to not be addictive, also the intensity of the experience creates a dysphoria that causes people not to return to the drug. Thomas, who researches the pharmaceutical drug-related side effects, believes that we should be skeptical because of the long wait for testing on rats, although she has not witnessed any testing in humans.\n\nSome of the research using salvinorin is interesting and does require some experimentation before it becomes available. The research team is using a mixture of the drug salvinorin bicarbonate plus sodium hydroxide for their study, and have been trying to replicate the effects of salvinorin bicarbonate on rats on various drugs. However, as the study with rats was the first published on an animal use of salvinorin, it still is difficult to assess any specific effect with other drugs like valproate or anhydrous ammonia, which are metabolized to the same chemical.\n\nIn addition, several of the experiments using salvinorin are still based on animals, although the use of animals in laboratory experiments may be based on a higher number of studies. A similar problem is encountered in a study involving rats that used salvinorin from a small group of healthy humans. On occasion the rats might give the drug to test positive, which may lead to an unexpected dose drop.\n\nFinally, a study where four animals were given the drug by a human had similar effects on the rats. The researchers had previously shown in humans that salvinorin stimulates the activity of adrenal glands in animals, but this work led them to wonder if it is something unique to humans.\n\nSalvinorin and Adipromine\n\nAlthough salvinorin and adipromine are both compounds that have been found in human tissues, which may be used as a compound to inhibit acetylcholine release in animals, neither compound has been tested on humans.\n\nSo why is salvinorin being investigated?\n\nSalvinorin is considered the best known compound by any scientists, and it has been used for over twenty years, not just until now. As a compound, salvinorin is very high in vitamin D and can increase blood pressure without even taking part in regular physical activity. The compound is also found to have some side effects in the intestines for people with diabetes. Thus, if the research is to be approved by the FDA, many of the more risky drugs might not need taking salvinorin, since most people with some type of high level of cholesterol will not be affected by it.\n\nStudies using salvinorin have been based on rats from a group of healthy subjects, with the only time that two groups were shown to have elevated levels of these drug receptors (that is, three groups were shown to have elevated levels of salvinorin, compared to two groups). The higher levels of these receptor are seen when the group in question has a higher body weight. The higher the level of receptor, the more drug effects may be occurring in their nervous system. It is possible that salvinorin is a promising drug in humans, and possibly as an alternative to some of the toxic drugs that have been approved as new health promotion drugs in the past.","token_len":675,"entropy":[8.8872,11.5307,11.3526,4.2512,2.2755,6.3189,8.6861,4.5818,11.3044,2.824,6.1754,0.1069,5.2778,1.0872,5.8266,1.7889,8.1087,5.169,9.9088,0.266,0.842,5.5976,7.4546,0.829,9.7145,2.2788,2.4445,4.5428,2.4847,4.6724,0.0491,5.6693,0.2472,1.5136,1.6682,0.9368,11.2875,2.7962,1.0607,5.5734,0.0017,1.6244,5.6206,4.8883,3.1333,2.7681,3.1316,0.1715,1.4844,3.0259,0.5682,6.021,1.7078,1.4851,4.5206,4.3905,2.0486,0.5415,4.1861,4.1355,1.556,4.2989,4.7311,4.4334,1.8997,4.5519,4.0218,3.3126,2.1034,6.057,1.1991,5.044,2.4916,0.7201,0.4046,0.5791,0.0006,5.5782,2.2101,0.2626,3.1865,5.2386,1.0127,4.3976,0.0872,0.0391,2.892,5.0639,2.8176,4.4172,5.4977,2.3817,3.751,4.4921,0.9719,2.371,2.2549,1.5626,2.4885,2.9686,3.0376,2.4571,3.7658,1.9879,4.9525,0.0346,3.2821,2.0823,3.1747,0.1448,0.0299,0.0084,6.7476,2.8971,0.0628,0.0086,4.8954,3.76,2.6237,0.0144,0.0105,3.2641,3.3389,1.6749,1.5183,1.7362,5.8492,2.3458,4.2977,0.4908,3.1968,0.9935,1.7434,0.5596,1.2784,0.1218,0.0066,0.0074,2.4705,0.0137,0.0003,0.0012,1.2599,1.5394,4.871,4.087,3.2785,0.7807,3.1394,0.074,4.1909,2.0619,2.5941,5.1395,1.1088,1.9564,5.1547,0.1753,3.8228,1.1548,5.2646,2.3726,6.2177,1.0297,0.5256,0.0081,0.0017,0.0018,0.7668,1.485,5.0227,2.9917,3.8766,0.0592,3.9109,4.5018,2.767,2.2497,5.0554,3.5826,0.5164,4.3724,4.0603,0.2131,0.8975,1.142,4.8475,3.3016,0.0961,3.0726,2.1259,1.6439,1.3074,5.1432,0.0979,2.3749,2.4858,1.522,2.2045,1.6528,0.6844,0.0002,3.2637,1.8201,0.744,5.3196,2.1873,0.08,4.073,1.744,0.6466,0.005,0.0027,0.0023,3.0461,2.8124,5.8669,0.1121,2.976,1.4201,3.5735,1.8907,5.2316,0.0571,2.5853,1.6801,4.6222,1.6599,2.9957,1.4162,5.5804,0.121,3.1476,4.2351,4.1439,0.0372,4.6509,1.2223,4.0743,3.8846,2.9856,1.7321,2.877,1.6377,3.2589,1.2531,2.5155,1.3351,2.0784,1.9629,1.2596,0.007,0.0063,0.0085,6.0787,1.7281,4.3388,2.0263,0.4811,4.9089,3.6197,0.7223,5.5737,5.0835,2.7805,1.1333,5.9471,5.5071,2.5771,1.0529,1.0516,4.8355,1.2343,1.6646,2.5068,2.4184,2.1018,0.0728,2.8618,4.1693,4.9207,4.0921,1.0261,1.3194,0.0002,4.8865,0.0288,2.9863,1.6767,6.0428,6.0759,3.6668,0.7512,1.2109,2.1761,0.7298,3.2466,1.4501,3.8856,4.9007,2.652,1.6587,1.947,1.7516,1.1853,1.3068,1.6484,2.2287,3.7175,4.1936,1.9097,3.7924,2.5048,0.178,0.9246,0.0219,0.0043,0.0071,5.9246,0.6676,4.4218,0.0415,5.3501,0.7025,0.2004,1.2552,3.8795,1.0295,1.2505,2.039,4.5186,5.5753,1.1536,0.0112,3.3893,1.1132,1.7118,2.2091,4.5715,5.6296,0.4602,0.2385,0.5385,1.3482,0.0003,4.7997,0.0625,0.0023,0.0028,3.6159,5.6233,2.1727,5.5381,1.7665,0.4533,0.0002,3.8709,1.9668,0.0051,0.0023,0.0057,2.1903,8.1005,0.9342,0.0103,0.7352,2.3079,4.1198,1.0475,2.0478,0.6325,2.4883,1.3562,2.1366,3.9287,0.4308,5.807,2.4523,1.3245,4.1785,1.4606,1.1189,4.8971,1.4585,4.9626,6.0098,0.1428,0.0642,0.0598,0.8696,2.1635,2.9449,0.2399,3.9375,1.9402,1.2975,0.4443,2.2433,1.7564,0.3505,0.3814,1.5546,0.0002,5.0774,4.035,1.4409,1.0856,0.0034,0.0022,0.0072,3.3794,3.5787,2.3052,1.3178,0.0001,2.4109,0.0089,0.0022,0.0035,1.0364,3.7459,2.3478,3.0514,1.2254,2.2245,4.4009,6.3548,4.804,1.3813,1.23,1.6589,1.0972,0.4514,1.1845,1.6838,2.4876,4.8383,0.0947,2.8472,5.5194,1.6168,6.1072,1.7956,0.4429,4.068,1.8547,2.1972,0.7993,1.1997,0.0034,0.0044,0.005,1.1543,3.4037,3.827,0.1172,4.6516,1.8418,1.5258,3.7607,3.6471,1.6454,1.0293,5.1795,5.6456,2.2518,4.6732,0.0244,3.6425,3.1472,0.8256,0.2673,2.8922,3.3727,1.1786,0.7603,2.4797,2.5751,1.7836,3.5918,3.3386,0.0656,2.9285,2.1904,5.6522,0.0003,5.9139,2.4134,1.1419,1.3909,1.1643,6.0595,0.2324,3.6084,2.4832,3.8385,1.8308,2.026,0.6355,3.9916,0.8734,0.2248,0.5016,0.3091,5.8724,1.676,0.4199,4.6456,5.9609,1.0319,4.1355,2.6307,3.859,6.4995,1.0384,0.0078,0.0029,0.0072,2.2001,3.3337,3.6457,1.4841,2.5472,6.331,0.7795,0.0076,5.3098,6.7674,0.4572,3.1895,2.3586,1.1864,2.2479,2.0546,0.8943,1.7235,0.2318,0.4012,0.0002,4.7814,2.013,0.7352,0.0024,0.0022,0.0028,1.0005,1.2065,5.8143,0.1409,2.0805,5.1681,2.2887,3.1192,0.259,1.0774,3.4023,1.2482,3.2824,1.9541,3.9289,5.4203,2.3761,6.533,2.4107,1.3953,3.4312,0.1024,1.5343,5.6434,0.9123,0.0707,3.8255,4.9432,4.9221,3.7829,5.4727,0.198,0.0911,6.1086,2.9848,2.4262,0.6087,0.055,0.3826,0.6248,0.1253,0.2538,1.8369,0.0051,0.0078,0.0065,2.4325,5.2852,0.401,1.9219,0.2333,2.4151,1.9281,5.0798,1.1563,0.2351,1.2045,2.5225,3.4352,2.6966,1.445,1.1662,4.3855,3.6144,0.629,2.0003,1.7976,1.2743,3.6113,1.5811,1.8137,2.2939,2.3891,1.9948,2.7328,0.2363,3.4717,0.4135,0.0271,1.1781,5.2538,4.8085,3.192,1.022,5.1767,2.5871,4.5762,5.4308,0.1583,0.4518,4.1407,0.5952,1.9497,0.1278,2.2106,0.0039,0.0018,0.0035,2.1206,2.0398,5.4756,1.7337,2.438,2.2335,0.9709,2.1496,4.3585,4.4279,2.2259,1.5636,0.3414,3.4882,0.5133,0.1318,6.036,1.2584,1.7478,1.7329,0.2253,5.1918,3.4298,5.0374,5.7625,6.2301,0.9092,1.9128,0.3596,1.0124,0.2713]}
{"id":3363,"ended":true,"length":646,"gen_text":"The music video for `` Do or Die `` was directed by Leto, who was credited as pseudonym Bartholomew Cubbins. Leto developed its concept as a companion piece to the music video of \" 'Do or Die' \ufffd the new live album on the album.\n\nThe songs in the album were ''Do or Die'' and ``Do you think?\" to which several individuals objected: one of them said ``If you want to listen to this song right now, just listen and learn. The songs just didn't sound right on the night he died.'' Another said ``if you're listening to this album now, just listen and have fun.'' This led two other respondents: one said ''I don't want to listen to this song'' while the other said, with a slightly different sentiment, ``Look at your feet now. I know what a good looking guy looks like.'' Another said ''I really like my feet but I'm sure they can't change.'' One of the three respondents complained that what they had heard, and to an enthusiastic laughter from the whole crowd, had been ''too much of the same music... This music, this music is so boring right now. It's so not worth it.''\n\nAnother respondent asked, ``Do you want your life to get better next time?'' the first to give the first reaction, ``Well, probably so.'' Another respondent said, ``The next five...'' while another said, ``I don't really care what you say.'' Another answered, ``I don't think you've really given a shit about the game.'' A further respondent asked, ``I don't think you've done much to help my life.'' It was also noted that if the last respondent went through with the interview, he would also have been asked to tell the audience how he felt at the beginning of the recording, in the middle of the song.\n\nAccording to the recording, in an effort to keep from interrupting the recording time, Leto tried to set up a second microphone during the recording. There was one major issue with this method of recording, as it was extremely difficult to tell who was listening to what; at some point, he needed to put a microphone on the side of the recording and turn the recording off; or wait for the recording to finish, before trying to listen to the song again. The recording lasted about 15 minutes, and the recorder had already left the recording.\n\nThe recording's final notes are shown below.\n\nIn the title track of ``Do or Die,'' Leto was heard screaming as he left the studio.\n\nThe audio recording of ``Do or Die'' is available on Bandcamp. Click here for downloadable and complete song listings, recording sources, and other records.\n\nYou can listen to Leto's \ufffdDo or Die\ufffd live album HERE. It is a self-titled album, \"Do or Die'', recorded at the T&E studio located approximately 10 minutes from downtown Los Angeles - and features Leto, Ailma, the band \"Leto,\" and a few other vocalists (the track is also available as an 8-minute mp3 from T&E's website as well as through Bandcamp's dedicated page here ).\n\nFor more of the song listing on Bandcamp, click

{"id":3985,"ended":false,"length":617,"gen_text":"The reproductive behaviour of the king vulture in the wild is poorly known, and much knowledge has been gained from observing birds in captivity, particularly at the Paris Menagerie. An adult king vulture can live in a closed enclosure for as long as 1.5 to 2 days because of its protective habitat, and can also survive under direct sunlight provided for by a wide variety of vegetation and animal species, but other life forms that may benefit from this relatively inexpensive habitat are not so well known. The reproductive behavior of this highly productive and versatile bird is poorly exemplified by human habitations, most notably in the wild. In some species, we have encountered the death of many of the most important members of their family, including the monarch eagles, black vultures, silver kestrel s, and brown bears. In the domestic monarchs, the mink can be mated with five other living monarchs with little or no risk of developing immunity to any of these traits. However, many mink mamas are not well-known as living monarchs, and many have failed to survive during the maturation stage. These failures may contribute to the failure of the remaining mamas to survive further during the maturation stage, making their mating conditions even more attractive to some mites. Most of these minks are mated through the first year, and remain so for two or three years thereafter. In some species, the mink is mated during the young stage, and at the death of those mamas there is no permanent replacement for the mink, even at the point of maturity. Some mink s will emerge from this cycle and will only become mated within 30 days of maturity; in others, the young will only become available during winter, and continue to mate in the early stages of maturation. Mating between a large number of young females increases their viability in the breeding season, even if the mother may remain weak. The young will also seek refuge under the large dens of a dense forest, or over dense savannahs where the food resources can only be found in the areas of good habitat for other groups of animals. In some species, mink breeding is successful until the age of 50. In the domestic monarchs, the mink s make their offspring available during autumn, even as early as 1 spring. In some species, however, mink breeding is not generally successful, with the queen and the egg laying being unsuccessful at the age of 10 years. In some species, mink s will die during the early stages of maturation and, even as early as the age of 55, this can make mink survival very difficult by the mid-stages of this cycle. In some species, this does not occur until at least the second trimester of maturation, with all mink s dying within the second trimester. It is not unusual for mink s to die in the summer or spring, after mating and the young have achieved the highest maturation potential, and even in the wild, mink s are not in the wild at all, except very recently. Most mink s will be mated as either juveniles or adult at different times of the year, in the most mature season of the season, when some may not have been available for most of the maturation cycle.\n\n1 2","token_len":677,"entropy":[11.2109,7.8548,0.2431,2.0024,9.2101,8.5845,2.7929,3.3084,1.5216,3.2581,1.6003,6.098,2.7644,1.632,1.2363,5.2683,6.9617,1.8002,0.3799,2.6304,1.0526,5.4542,5.1835,1.8451,0.8326,2.1792,3.843,4.2643,1.6731,7.6489,10.1961,1.6474,0.0055,1.218,5.601,6.4011,3.1216,0.2113,0.0027,2.2717,3.0465,2.8475,1.5192,5.5997,1.5691,1.5989,3.4209,0.1319,0.0035,4.1851,2.6061,0.1951,2.7345,0.59,3.1859,7.0981,1.1305,0.7184,5.8957,3.9449,1.4688,1.4858,2.6871,3.4573,3.3346,3.0106,4.1089,0.7768,6.4097,4.4407,0.4368,1.944,5.088,1.7238,0.001,2.7912,1.913,4.8995,1.3665,2.3542,4.5049,6.1565,5.1909,0.5044,4.5124,2.4401,5.1456,0.2052,2.8211,5.2498,6.473,2.2493,1.4268,2.3802,3.5276,1.5892,1.0894,0.2093,2.0638,4.5605,3.2732,0.0934,3.4799,5.7882,4.2577,2.9489,4.343,1.4743,0.8717,2.2277,7.7323,0.0043,0.6409,6.7609,4.8107,2.1735,1.6152,5.3092,0.5504,1.1683,1.173,2.677,0.9695,2.7917,3.4442,2.7981,0.6253,5.94,1.153,4.5712,2.3479,5.5535,0.3823,4.9441,2.1424,0.7307,3.6023,1.6048,3.2762,0.0179,3.0245,1.6336,0.9588,1.738,0.977,4.7159,6.1953,1.8598,0.9814,5.5184,5.1313,0.4328,0.0021,0.3135,6.1458,5.9574,2.3531,0.0014,6.116,3.0854,1.0809,5.7275,4.8993,0.4342,2.3238,1.8698,5.205,4.2964,1.8291,0.4127,1.7663,5.4771,4.3605,4.1752,1.7899,5.9222,0.2969,0.5239,5.9693,1.8323,5.744,3.4017,0.1237,4.8113,4.4613,0.7419,0.0108,3.7596,0.3382,5.5111,4.9139,0.7242,4.3009,1.3296,1.1552,5.6676,0.365,3.4171,0.0088,3.9453,3.8713,0.0816,3.9374,3.0787,2.0528,2.6838,3.7553,1.9128,2.3877,3.7772,5.1464,1.4133,0.0119,1.0902,0.5116,2.8479,2.636,4.7107,0.1249,2.8305,4.9348,1.6299,4.3681,0.853,2.1254,1.2816,3.8965,4.7658,2.6058,4.8662,0.0953,0.7758,4.3055,0.1699,1.9796,5.7721,1.2093,0.9355,0.6092,1.745,5.1029,3.4571,0.7388,1.8379,0.0469,0.8112,1.3974,4.5343,2.6856,4.195,5.0618,2.5824,0.3481,6.5988,0.7781,4.9503,1.3115,7.5218,0.4473,5.1884,1.8715,1.2956,9.859,4.7033,1.3835,4.0141,0.1154,5.0631,2.1928,3.8453,2.2159,2.7205,1.2784,5.3828,3.5461,1.4909,4.4848,1.5155,0.1818,0.5348,3.3058,0.3756,2.5252,1.4394,1.2485,0.3121,1.5339,0.8853,0.5221,2.0092,2.0477,0.0065,3.6037,0.5541,4.8351,2.5761,0.966,1.1623,4.8695,1.5923,6.0955,0.2316,6.7302,0.9157,0.0729,4.4982,0.4711,1.5133,5.3732,3.6314,1.9516,0.5959,1.1229,0.527,1.977,3.3601,4.0826,0.8236,2.5972,0.4332,2.4708,0.276,3.784,1.2587,0.3058,4.5638,4.6456,5.9921,0.9705,2.7566,3.8581,1.7706,4.029,5.2142,3.4289,1.5559,0.1119,4.0822,5.3331,0.7617,0.7709,2.1265,3.7042,1.6926,1.5463,0.4824,1.2333,2.4591,1.6902,3.7847,1.4952,4.42,2.9499,6.0312,1.6622,0.986,4.9212,0.3287,1.6974,3.5519,0.944,3.5533,2.7384,0.34,2.2134,0.0577,0.6314,4.3019,1.2559,2.2644,3.0227,3.645,0.3636,0.0194,2.9126,4.7523,5.851,2.412,6.0515,2.499,0.8554,2.2526,1.0777,0.7226,5.0348,1.6359,1.054,3.7106,5.1177,4.653,5.1108,2.3635,2.2612,4.4539,2.6598,2.5703,5.2425,4.9111,4.1357,1.683,5.0819,5.7156,0.411,4.4301,4.6435,1.483,1.432,3.3864,4.5671,3.0894,5.0473,0.7653,0.136,3.7174,1.7021,4.8506,3.4182,4.5751,4.5489,0.2063,0.7409,1.5298,1.7728,5.5065,1.7104,5.2824,2.3729,1.5621,3.7856,5.2893,0.4603,2.9567,0.4598,2.293,1.0345,0.8546,0.2758,2.6005,1.5096,4.0286,1.4234,4.3211,4.5193,0.8081,3.7441,0.0231,2.65,1.9363,1.7605,2.4355,2.2344,0.6813,0.1535,0.1139,1.5076,0.8374,0.0385,2.0479,5.8386,2.5706,4.5956,3.5505,2.8538,6.7809,1.3848,4.8416,3.8465,4.0013,0.0149,4.0927,5.4467,0.7268,1.5701,1.0441,0.5279,0.1747,3.099,0.0034,1.9137,0.1888,1.412,1.0871,1.3883,6.3435,0.1743,2.2233,3.5124,1.4922,6.1004,3.1934,2.3778,5.6727,2.0333,4.5146,2.4442,3.0764,1.4825,2.1188,0.0215,3.7194,2.002,0.4854,1.5111,0.789,0.5323,0.1636,1.6541,0.0543,1.8985,2.4574,4.1992,2.1522,0.661,3.3315,1.052,0.0698,0.5054,0.0412,2.5464,4.0597,3.1506,4.317,1.1013,0.0055,2.6019,2.1474,0.0258,5.3501,0.1908,5.5379,3.0661,4.7176,3.4279,0.9979,4.5605,3.1522,0.1497,5.2163,1.1219,4.3137,0.3161,5.1901,1.3841,0.1334,5.2681,1.1114,0.2157,1.7571,0.6173,0.431,0.1133,3.9077,4.3405,0.0585,0.7375,1.9817,3.1893,0.1041,1.2788,3.6869,4.1324,0.0033,0.4932,1.3975,0.0597,0.5861,3.2777,4.9723,1.1434,0.393,0.4074,3.3073,1.7511,1.2788,2.4914,0.0593,0.0001,0.9055,4.1212,0.3004,2.2195,2.7638,0.3737,1.0283,0.0487,0.3171,0.0982,1.5154,2.1915,0.8196,3.4365,2.8747,3.3065,1.2003,3.9802,3.5005,2.9246,2.3733,2.7017,0.7788,5.3089,2.126,4.1594,3.7436,0.1163,3.0364,2.0802,1.6433,3.6301,1.8603,0.8217,4.3831,1.3267,1.696,0.0354,0.6174,1.9446,1.6162,5.3267,2.3742,2.791,1.2207,1.2401,2.3919,4.2987,6.5546,2.3661,0.7368,4.2945,0.8163,0.0332,0.2521,2.5217,2.5433,3.2061,0.013,4.3973,6.1127,3.9112,0.2356,2.3467,3.8769,5.4257,0.5431,1.9119,0.6073,0.2516,0.7859,3.5164,1.8163,4.5981,4.3627,4.0545,2.2479,0.6879,2.2167,0.8128,3.6712,5.8216,3.2174,2.8552,2.1513,1.2614,2.6176,1.1749,5.3371,0.2737,0.4542,1.4611,0.126,3.5342,0.4518,3.4411,0.0015,5.2418,4.6917]}
{"id":164,"ended":false,"length":553,"gen_text":"Bowman scored his first goals for York away to Cheltenham Town, as York twice fought back from behind to draw 2 \u2013 2. York drew 3 \u2013 3 away to Bristol Rovers to take 2 \u2013 2 in their last meeting before moving to the King Power Stadium to play Brighton in Group D play. Bournemouth also defeated Cheltenham Town for the first time since 2001, as played by Andy Warz\u00fcndell.\nWith Bournemouth relegated from the group and relegated to the Championship before losing three points, the Bournemouth players were left disappointed at the bottom of the North East and the new head coach John Bowker was forced to call their performances into question.\nHowever, their performances on Tuesday came on a night where they are the second top-class team yet to break away from their relegation zone.\nWith the loss, Bournemouth's four goals were in defence, while the home side's three are in defence. Bournemouth were drawn away and won 2 \u2013 1 with their game, and there's a suggestion the side should be heading into their last home game with a defeat.\nWhile Bournemouth's performances in this fixture have been good, there's not as much optimism about the team's chances of getting through to their qualifying campaign. From the bench, the hosts were very good against the Bournemouth defense, which was able to generate little run-ins with the visiting teams.\nBournemouth's record against York this season: 8-3-1\nTottenham Hotspur (2-3-1, 1 draw)\nSt James' Park Rangers (6-0-0)\nSunderland Rovers (6-1-1, 2 draws)\nBurnley (4-1-1, 1 draw)\nBirmingham City (4-2-2, 1 draw)\nBirmingham City vs. Middlesbrough on March 28, 2015 at the Allianz Arena\nIt is one of many games the visitors will play this year. The only time this year this season they have played at home was last season's 2-2 draw with Bristol Rovers. They are currently unbeaten, with one loss on the road. The 2-2 draw with Middlesbrough will have been seen by some as an easy win for the visitors, but it was seen as one of the easiest fixtures in the FA Cup competition. The Rovers will be the first team away from the stadium since September 10, 2009 to face Blackburn Rovers, the first team away from the club since 1997.\nWith the loss, Bournemouth's four goals were in defence, while the home side's three are in defence. The home team are winning 3 \u2013 2 with their game, and there's a suggestion the side should be heading into their last home game with a draw.

{"id":1207,"ended":false,"length":598,"gen_text":"Musicians who have cited Simone as important for their own musical upbringing include Elton John ( who named one of his pianos after her ), Aretha Franklin, Adele, David Bowie, Emeli Sande, T.I., Thelonious Monk, and others\n\nThe fact is that women musicians are still working in the music industry today. Many of the male singers, musicians, and producers are women. In fact, we know that there was once a time when male musicians and producers shared the same style and sound, and that what they were doing together was artistry and craftsmanship, and that it was important to have a female producer play with the music that was more powerful and creative. Women have also never been excluded for speaking their minds to the music industry ; there are still some that want to use women as pawns. As a feminist, I can't be the only one calling out this pattern. But I am sure there can be other examples to explain what it means to be a feminist. As part of our research, I created an online survey to see if women made some of the key female performers\/actresses. I found nearly 75% of them and I can give you an idea on where they were at this point.\n\nWe went through our archives to see if we could pinpoint where they might be. Our questions centered on, which female actors were performing with the same voice or voiceover as our male stars. Some were female, some were male:\n\nWho were the key female performers for your ensemble?\n\nDoesn't that make you think they're important?\n\nWho are the main ladies\/gods\/stars in your ensemble?\n\nDid it make you think they're important?\n\nHow does this affect our musical performance outcomes?\n\nWe chose to ask the following questions, which were in the form [1]:\n\n1. The most important:\n\nDid your performance match what we thought of them?\n\nDid you ever question them about their voice?\n\n2. The least important:\n\nDid your performance match their voice?\n\nDid they perform in a traditional way?\n\nHow did your performance match their overall performance?\n\n3. The third:\n\nDo you think your performance was a success?\n\nIf you answered yes, you were asked a series of questions about what kind of record you had in mind for your performance, if you were aware of it, and how your performance differed from ours.\n\n4. If you answered no, who, where, and how would you tell us about this?\n\n5. The best:\n\nHow would your performance fit with our findings? Were there more girls doing it? How comfortable was your performance with women?\n\n6. The worst:\n\nWhat is your opinion on gender roles?\n\n7.

{"id":1311,"ended":false,"length":551,"gen_text":"Beginning with the 12th century, important socio @ - @ political changes took place in the Deccan, south of the Krishna river. During this period, the Hoysalas, native Kannadigas from the western region, in the upper part of the state, sought to establish their own religious community in the lower half of the state. On 26 Jan 1947, for the first time in India, a group of 14 monks under the Guru Granth Sahib began training for their first secular school. In the process, over 1000 Kannadigas and 10 lakh followers were formed. This culminated in the start of the Bharat Ramah (or The Awakening of the Hindu Consciousness) in 1966 and the development of the Kannadigas movement in the area. In 1968, the first public meeting of the MBCN was held on 6-7 October 1968 in Bengaluru to discuss how they should build a secular religion in the region. In 1974, the first 'Guru Ram and the Ganesha' meeting, attended there by MBCN leaders, became a major event, as some of the key leaders of MBCN held public meetings for MBCN in their respective capitals on 19-21 October 1976. At this meeting, the MBCN met with members of local society, Kannadiyas, and the various religions, who shared their concerns (such as the need to build a secular religion in the region and the need to make the MBCN an integral part of those communities). The MBCN formed two committees to address these concerns, as they had expressed their concerns that the state leadership was biased towards religion.The local MBCN, under the leadership of Harsha, held a meeting on the 24th of Nauru and in the evening, the MBCN decided to create a new MBCN's ministry in the region, 'Mahirayana', where any religious issues that were addressed could be fully addressed by an MBCN representative. All these groups started out in a different manner. In fact, when Harsha took charge, Kannadiyas and other non-religions, including Hindus and Shias, were given seats in the MBCN and were encouraged by him to join in. The issue of the MBCN was raised in the meeting with several local leaders. This resulted in several events. The MBCN and the Nauru Buddhist Council (NHLC ), the Hindu Buddhist National Congress (HNPC) and numerous Hindu religious centres such as the Mohanagar Temple in Namanagiri, Mahasiddhi Temple in Namanagiri, Jagodathin Temple in Namanagiri etc. were formed to present our concerns. One of the NDC's chief architects, Prampapath K.P. ( Kanna ) became a Hindu after witnessing the first Hindu-Brahmins meeting, held at the NHLC. This led the team to form an executive committee - a non-Hindu body, to be chaired by a Kannadiga, to address all questions in their domain. The organization of the NHLC developed, from a 'community centre' setting up and various offices - an area of development- to become the center of the government and MBCN.\n\n1 2","token_len":681,"entropy":[4.3163,1.2083,7.4795,0.8996,2.9445,0.564,8.8481,8.5064,14.8459,7.0618,4.6972,5.6244,5.165,2.4329,0.0376,1.1691,1.4805,9.3156,1.971,0.0274,2.0767,7.1843,0.7089,2.1159,12.7782,2.6662,0.9678,4.5288,1.4605,0.5697,0.5736,1.6117,6.9858,6.9282,2.8095,3.1689,2.6519,9.0087,6.0478,1.0685,2.6492,5.7089,0.2237,4.2733,1.2755,4.7979,3.4847,1.1656,5.5991,1.6572,5.5062,2.6039,0.0299,0.4804,2.5661,0.5405,5.0811,0.7665,2.394,1.0341,0.6252,4.7005,3.5529,1.4722,0.6519,4.6794,4.5273,0.1197,0.1675,0.1349,0.4233,5.1061,5.8426,4.5885,5.0762,0.2132,5.3021,0.7271,0.2087,0.007,0.9626,2.1494,0.4508,2.0646,3.5646,0.0833,5.6596,5.8005,5.5798,0.4222,5.8902,2.535,0.0007,0.0066,0.0094,4.9907,5.7071,2.8895,1.6993,2.6576,5.0371,3.923,1.2618,2.7808,1.727,4.181,0.4485,4.9842,3.887,2.6729,0.0434,0.2222,0.0451,0.0055,3.0571,5.1646,3.8414,2.9408,2.063,3.8914,0.8557,3.1195,6.1178,0.1978,0.442,5.5366,0.0243,0.4938,5.0217,1.1219,5.1947,5.6197,2.7656,5.9351,4.9271,5.0642,2.2533,1.0222,3.0399,5.8117,0.0523,1.0712,0.9679,5.3666,2.4115,1.0057,4.7346,0.0461,0.8927,3.6334,0.1902,0.7077,0.2191,0.0379,2.5468,0.9458,0.6327,5.1084,0.9133,2.4473,3.962,0.1946,0.8759,2.8289,5.1836,2.3278,0.7846,0.333,5.9206,5.3169,5.466,1.2547,0.0277,3.1235,5.3976,2.5774,0.5016,4.6783,2.1616,1.6609,5.2993,0.0617,2.7255,1.8544,4.2518,4.3336,2.5987,3.164,0.8798,2.43,6.1117,1.1985,0.6928,2.8253,0.295,2.1226,3.5915,0.2099,0.7616,2.4132,5.0635,4.408,0.342,2.4152,5.5881,2.2029,4.5815,3.4578,0.0844,0.9669,2.527,4.2629,3.235,8.1491,0.2858,4.9049,0.1714,0.0833,2.028,0.7368,4.7436,1.7249,2.892,1.2052,3.4852,2.6206,5.7078,1.4156,0.2754,5.017,1.6431,0.7762,3.3831,0.0103,0.0124,4.4106,3.2248,0.7243,3.8881,3.7717,0.0106,0.0174,2.6084,3.5579,1.6446,5.0393,4.5672,4.4384,0.5265,1.6702,1.0916,2.6995,0.3458,3.9454,1.2732,0.4581,0.1751,1.2913,1.7459,0.01,0.0036,5.0806,1.5159,4.3312,0.1583,4.95,4.6656,1.1513,5.3952,0.3806,0.2527,6.8497,0.2536,0.5537,2.2934,2.5972,4.1317,4.7442,2.0493,3.8711,3.7618,0.3857,3.1233,5.9984,4.0848,0.0056,1.3939,2.0467,1.0151,2.6048,0.2895,0.6762,0.8903,0.7167,0.4678,0.6477,2.054,1.2404,0.4513,0.5869,4.3061,1.9553,2.9396,0.0169,0.0047,2.8574,1.6722,0.0523,0.0411,6.4499,1.0303,1.1752,1.6447,1.5445,0.0045,0.0023,4.716,4.4608,2.5804,1.6637,3.9352,1.7693,1.2585,1.7169,4.5779,2.4109,2.4385,5.6341,0.5886,2.3108,3.6754,1.019,3.5353,6.4881,1.7196,5.3571,0.8167,4.0234,1.371,6.4901,6.0229,1.9114,0.0087,0.0048,3.1907,4.6666,0.5031,0.6148,0.019,5.4048,3.7764,1.2689,2.3499,3.8392,1.1202,2.2316,1.3652,4.1894,4.274,0.1162,0.7144,7.4322,5.0552,0.0051,3.1454,3.655,1.4553,2.6967,1.2735,1.5921,1.2462,0.0093,0.0012,4.3476,0.3858,4.6703,0.4145,2.5072,2.3339,0.0314,0.0043,6.5204,5.3022,2.056,0.6376,1.4391,1.9297,6.197,4.2249,5.5022,5.1098,0.295,3.337,3.8107,6.0566,2.9755,3.6777,3.2139,1.6469,4.1138,2.2522,0.0998,5.7377,0.7458,2.6646,4.2151,0.76,0.011,0.0013,4.027,0.3933,5.7127,2.6546,5.1523,5.0917,5.6467,2.2111,2.5268,3.0862,2.6497,1.9314,2.4139,3.5314,0.0356,4.7782,3.5572,0.0328,0.0025,3.6072,2.3318,1.8083,5.3773,0.1071,0.0366,1.8526,0.0173,2.1217,1.4638,3.3852,0.1504,5.5833,0.4159,0.2718,2.7793,1.7521,2.8362,1.6915,4.9398,2.8624,0.2043,2.0469,3.1229,4.7163,0.5872,0.353,1.0268,0.0062,0.002,2.9608,2.8337,3.8232,2.9114,2.4885,0.1535,2.3078,2.3786,2.0509,1.9014,5.9854,0.4555,2.3727,2.1466,0.0229,0.0021,2.4763,2.9599,1.9184,1.1506,2.142,2.8804,4.3967,3.2582,1.6172,1.8808,3.3562,3.6702,0.0085,4.3813,4.3831,2.9989,1.7314,2.0107,0.0079,0.0017,4.5075,1.2837,5.1472,1.2442,0.0614,5.3733,3.8082,2.5194,5.4994,4.4578,9.5012,2.6076,4.0014,3.5236,5.1132,2.8299,0.3756,0.4065,3.2879,3.5333,0.7561,1.158,5.5643,3.9204,2.7593,5.4187,4.2349,0.0016,1.9628,5.4523,1.5822,3.3371,3.8713,1.7476,2.8893,7.3985,3.2778,0.5274,1.2765,4.5029,3.9277,3.814,0.8709,1.1742,0.2933,2.4065,0.7513,0.1203,0.0042,0.6602,5.8125,4.3009,5.6325,5.4509,1.3488,0.1569,0.8363,0.0165,0.0129,0.0029,5.5511,0.5339,1.2087,1.8033,2.087,5.5644,6.3042,2.0814,1.5454,4.7813,0.6828,0.9285,4.1177,5.4345,1.3971,3.2035,5.5622,0.7601,5.0441,7.1788,4.047,4.3915,3.4089,3.1051,4.9061,0.2822,4.7803,7.5154,5.5517,3.0805,5.2314,1.9156,5.3614,4.4973,4.5067,0.7352,3.9684,2.624,3.2062,2.8834,2.2214,4.0266,1.0696,3.6569,3.1835,1.8775,1.1302,4.4413,0.046,2.0737,2.732,3.5553,3.3497,6.7074,0.4534,2.4139,3.2347,5.2738,0.1648,7.0891,3.0276,4.3277,0.0205,3.8805,0.0604,2.9414,2.3288,2.6259,2.2718,2.2648,0.0328,1.7861,4.0416,0.0981,0.2123,6.1953,2.3197,2.3121,2.4901,2.5477,3.5004,4.021,3.7767,5.9476,0.4889,1.4054,5.8311,1.6111,0.5305,0.6012,0.006,6.2068,3.6186,3.6979,2.3843,4.5038,4.9436,5.3339,0.5402,6.2044,0.8705,4.3033,5.6898,4.9936,5.2041,4.5928,4.6299,1.5412,4.2946,5.7419,2.9982,2.1382,1.779,3.7452,0.2573,1.7693,5.3978,2.3393,4.952,0.0511,0.0078,0.8957,4.509,0.0235,5.1951,4.2102]}
{"id":2822,"ended":false,"length":614,"gen_text":"Ernest II, Duke of Saxe @ - @ Coburg and Gotha = Ernest II ( German : Ernst August Karl Johann Leopold Alexander Eduard ; 21 June 1818 \u2013 22 August 1893 ) was born in Dresden in 1870 in the year 2210.[4] During the 1820's he married Norenzander Lopold von Hermansford.\n\nHe studied at the University of Dresden, and later married Gaus-\u00c9ric Bastet. This relationship eventually produced his first book, The Man Who Can Lead a World on the Water, and where he became a member of parliament for three years in the 1840s.[5] The first book was published in 1871 by R.A. Leichhardt on Leopold's behalf.[6]\n\n[7] Die Mannlichen Leopold von Hermansford und Karlsruhe (Historical German Ideology Press, 1874)\n\nKarl von Hermansford had the following to say about his marriage: \"In my opinion, there is no such thing as the son who does not have a wife of his own, who possesses a good conscience, and who is capable of thinking and of having opinions. As for the daughters of the first generation, they are not so, although they are very good.[8] The old man is one who is free from this, which is so important.\"[9] He may be said to have been \"unwilling to make the love of God unshakeable\".[10] He lived the same life as his two brothers Karl Karl. The two brothers lived in Leopold's house. The elder would like to see them become a family. And when the oldest dies, neither will give himself up for inheritance by taking the son. In this case, the heir would ask him if he is ready to take the son, in the hope that the younger ones will have a son with him, whereupon the old man would ask him to marry them; for this will be the first step towards the future of the family.[11]\n\nKarl's children are given names of their mothers, for which he makes arrangements in the name of God, through the \"bishops\" of his homelands, where the elder of the family was a bishop (or deacon).[12] Each of his six sons, however, dies before he reaches the age of 40,[13] and each is separated from his wife and has the option of leaving her with their youngest son. The elder son remains in Germany until he has reached the age of 46, and the second son until 60.\n\nThe younger son is called Friedrich the Great by his friends if one knows what that means. It is a term from the word 'beiter.' One may only say that it means 'king.' He can be called Friedrich the Great (bustering three sons). The younger son also has the option of leaving her for a mother of his own. This is the only family with an heir, no matter how young a son may be. The family name Friedrich the Great, used very often, may be \"the German of the year.\"\n\nLore [ edit ]\n\n[14] The great father [ edit ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]","token_len":681,"entropy":[6.1478,1.2926,8.5788,2.1496,7.6499,0.2355,5.0878,5.0329,14.0448,6.4431,7.1636,10.0942,2.6273,5.7389,7.1893,1.9373,8.6654,11.3468,3.6777,3.4979,10.2693,5.2758,5.4496,6.7792,5.3919,6.5547,5.089,3.6668,0.0022,8.1167,9.4438,0.1931,7.8243,7.752,3.9122,1.1643,3.9886,2.9982,3.2375,2.7567,5.7733,1.49,3.6419,2.4242,0.6355,4.3172,2.7399,5.7462,4.2834,1.0601,3.8504,6.1431,3.6341,7.1034,3.1113,0.0801,4.6775,1.2297,3.8634,1.0003,1.9393,1.1419,4.2468,5.1627,5.0402,1.9016,1.7165,5.0687,4.376,0.3065,1.6919,5.4789,2.8467,5.6857,2.7284,2.7772,0.0052,2.9202,4.0011,1.5273,1.001,1.6075,0.0275,3.1508,1.7616,2.3543,2.6646,5.7694,5.1574,6.0676,5.3741,4.5677,2.3502,4.6714,2.7878,2.0487,4.8449,3.4185,4.3113,4.5035,2.8923,1.9158,2.2042,0.6319,1.6934,5.1265,1.0821,5.2873,4.9864,1.7034,4.095,5.751,1.4611,3.6618,1.5388,3.0772,5.4617,1.3337,2.7915,1.4479,2.6424,0.0245,5.955,2.1375,4.5193,0.4405,2.6498,2.9471,4.1338,0.7212,1.999,0.3059,0.065,3.5275,2.9405,1.3681,1.7572,0.8017,0.3211,0.4911,4.4648,2.2744,5.3416,2.097,3.5159,0.0491,4.7052,5.2506,0.7298,4.583,6.1362,2.9332,0.0035,0.9561,2.2856,2.1334,0.1001,0.0428,1.3342,0.0002,5.829,1.7238,0.0405,5.866,5.9367,1.5025,2.7036,5.5794,0.945,0.0055,0.7799,0.1974,0.018,0.0128,3.8152,4.5781,5.4524,2.1842,0.2109,1.6438,5.7943,1.0824,4.1224,3.9891,0.0736,5.9856,0.6278,2.1158,2.9825,1.1061,2.7064,0.0002,5.0428,3.478,0.031,0.0049,0.0046,4.9283,4.0753,0.5778,1.3882,0.0224,0.2378,1.1743,2.7421,1.4322,1.6365,3.5605,2.2601,2.0934,0.9563,3.9089,0.6487,0.7019,3.063,0.1813,0.0335,2.8696,5.7036,3.0114,3.8811,0.191,1.7464,1.2453,1.7122,3.7596,0.0723,0.0385,1.4142,2.5201,5.8082,1.4974,3.9184,3.4158,0.8024,1.3147,0.6334,1.6231,4.294,0.0639,4.4458,2.363,3.0838,4.9933,4.0486,1.7226,4.9,1.5107,1.0798,5.4753,1.496,1.5559,4.5033,1.5311,0.5184,1.3921,0.9613,2.3117,3.375,3.7602,4.6215,0.8468,1.125,3.4993,2.4741,5.4884,0.6328,0.0422,2.665,5.3264,1.7181,2.2115,4.4028,1.4764,1.7491,5.5966,0.7617,4.8429,3.5379,3.9671,0.7754,5.0593,3.6591,2.7143,0.0832,0.0171,2.9971,5.856,1.3869,2.1123,0.0879,0.2286,1.3257,3.4202,4.5697,3.8475,0.4333,0.5253,4.135,2.5401,4.9163,0.6308,3.1854,4.9604,4.5679,0.0031,1.5791,0.0698,0.0179,2.3877,4.593,4.4829,4.1178,0.3955,0.3149,1.5316,5.1979,2.392,3.4565,4.5364,4.6657,3.3381,2.1393,2.1735,3.5246,1.3694,5.4431,0.5442,0.0024,0.04,1.5719,2.6078,2.5456,3.7234,4.9843,5.6887,0.1771,2.4527,2.8232,4.9925,2.4989,2.2176,1.2005,5.7021,3.8437,1.71,5.8102,2.5987,0.5349,5.9981,1.9006,4.523,6.0236,0.5574,2.4144,5.6894,5.2904,3.675,1.9702,4.6063,1.5982,3.3193,2.6878,2.0661,0.6105,1.2449,3.9578,1.6433,6.1102,3.3569,3.1001,0.2243,2.6112,2.2911,0.2746,2.0668,0.8374,1.4627,1.7822,4.5724,2.5296,1.3294,0.2932,1.8851,2.8229,5.7364,0.4985,3.5865,1.6203,3.1195,2.8539,1.1805,2.3517,6.1013,0.352,1.062,3.568,0.1142,0.6337,2.712,1.2467,1.9358,2.7355,2.9866,4.5581,3.9477,2.3217,3.3758,1.3486,1.6148,2.3858,2.2188,1.251,1.4158,3.3137,1.3855,0.7761,0.2642,1.8749,0.0779,0.0198,0.6779,0.0002,1.8212,2.746,4.482,2.6487,6.2032,2.9048,3.2063,2.087,4.0813,1.5655,4.6856,3.9164,1.4488,5.0026,5.017,3.126,1.8819,2.0831,0.0203,3.7026,1.9072,4.974,1.4009,4.7358,5.5013,2.4025,1.8825,1.0331,1.6748,5.601,0.2462,0.0002,1.5504,4.781,2.364,4.8652,4.447,0.4716,0.7294,4.2707,2.4357,1.433,4.0465,3.9251,4.5319,0.1332,1.8868,0.0434,0.0311,6.2339,0.991,1.4137,4.7227,1.4305,2.708,2.8933,0.0399,5.8848,2.3788,2.3908,1.8923,1.0618,0.1097,0.0297,4.9081,4.1393,0.0488,0.0202,1.0509,3.4212,2.7664,5.4335,0.2982,0.3868,3.7714,2.1116,4.5597,3.1787,3.0228,0.292,3.3293,1.7816,3.1967,3.1788,5.7958,1.4442,1.3433,2.0741,3.0903,2.3835,5.7067,1.6422,4.8137,1.4417,1.0528,3.1006,1.412,0.9225,0.0478,0.0122,4.8377,1.3609,1.1451,1.0722,2.6509,0.5308,4.6231,4.9614,1.1545,1.5761,0.0001,2.4363,3.8861,0.8332,1.6842,3.3719,4.3642,4.0867,3.0424,4.4777,1.3041,4.6048,6.9152,4.8111,4.5404,2.7396,4.0743,0.2504,0.9306,3.7131,0.5335,2.7012,3.9385,4.6803,0.8914,4.8098,3.7515,5.1998,4.8809,4.4651,4.9434,2.658,5.2644,2.1864,1.2598,2.6549,1.3945,1.0294,5.3786,1.813,2.9223,4.6508,1.8511,1.2845,2.0389,1.1178,0.7065,4.0358,4.5472,4.2365,4.2064,5.3311,1.7679,2.2046,2.0532,2.7541,0.299,4.2829,1.5554,0.9036,0.7678,0.1961,1.4474,4.4062,4.0365,1.6721,4.9474,2.7018,0.1498,0.2,1.1669,2.9686,0.9733,1.9306,2.3406,3.5227,3.957,3.718,1.5365,2.1978,5.7971,0.1727,0.9361,2.9495,4.3368,0.959,2.7452,0.3965,0.5315,2.1802,3.9296,2.5907,2.9383,1.2374,0.2652,3.309,4.7261,6.3446,0.8841,1.2603,4.3578,0.9124,4.4183,3.1005,4.1605,3.6491,0.8636,4.0636,0.9277,1.5949,0.0002,5.3911,4.1897,2.2469,0.0002,0.0023,0.0025,0.0001,3.4687,0.6643,0.0771,2.1234,5.9421,4.0548,4.8366,0.4887,0.001,0.0015,0.0002,4.8806,0.5885,0.368,0.0256,0.001,4.43,0.0002,2.9558,0.0651,0.0729,0.0158,0.0007,0.5732,0.0002,0.5297,0.0092,0.0006,0.0006]}
{"id":4250,"ended":false,"length":605,"gen_text":"After breaking from Gardner's Bricket Wood coven, Valiente formed her own coven with Grove as High Priest, still following the tradition of Gardnerian Wicca, albeit without the Wiccan laws, which allowed her to freely worship in the sanctuary of Cilicia. During the Fall, she was seen roaming with her friend and sister, Rizmza, for the next several months, occasionally playing with her fellow humans using her magic while performing rituals within the stone garden of her coven. As a young girl before her departure, she and her parents were captured during a kidnapping at the behest of her grandmother.\n\nGardner eventually became one of Valiente's many people who were raised by her and her mother, who were sent to investigate a recent incident, with Fergus the Elder of the Humble Coven living at the sanctuary's gate, along with her cousin Elisa (the woman living at the sanctuary with her own parents after she died).[2]\n\nSections [ edit ]\n\nIn order to aid in her mission, the Wiccan law called for some form of spiritual guidance. She and Rizmza used their spiritual powers as part of a ceremony for her to pray for the death of their respective parents, Elisa and Darloch. Both of these witches were subsequently named to serve the Wicca: Elisa was named High Priest, and Darloch was named Judge.\n\nShe was often seen interacting with the Wicca, especially those who shared their beliefs and had a desire to aid her, even if they were not directly involved in the plot. Elisa, when she discovered that Fergus and Haggard were the kidnappers, invited her to join her as a part of the festivities, but only after their mother had died, causing both Yashica and Pardis to have an idea what was happening. She then attempted to lead the prisoners to her sanctuary, but was interrupted by a priest whose eyes caught Fergus's by surprise, causing the young woman to flee the home. Yashica's parents, who took care of them during the rescue attempt, left the sanctuary when Fergus, who was still holding on to Elisa's body, became interested in her supernatural abilities and was seen giving her what was described as an amulet, which allowed her to see in the night. When Yashica returned several days later to ask for her and Elisa's assistance, the sisters had to return home after spending three days alone together together.[2][3]\n\nLocations [ edit ]\n\nElisa appears in a small section of the sanctuary itself, known as the Garden. She frequently appears in the garden with her comrades and her children, while Yashica and Pardis visit the sanctuary to interact with Yashica's children. In the nearby temple, there was much activity in the garden during the Spring Festival, which lasted until late June.[3]\n\nAs with the others, the Wicca occasionally appear in the chapel of the sanctuary. The rest of the sanctuary is filled except for a portion dedicated to her in case of emergencies. It is often called the Garden, and is composed of two sections, the entrance to the Garden's gardens and a section that houses the sacred chamber.[4]\n\nNotable examples [ edit ]","token_len":683,"entropy":[8.7674,4.7474,12.4909,0.7479,11.1268,11.711,8.1016,8.1325,3.1938,0.7219,9.3781,5.7957,0.2912,6.7659,5.038,0.4884,5.8908,0.1025,3.0401,10.8727,4.3877,10.1019,1.0745,2.3188,7.4761,5.6902,1.3932,3.5974,0.1899,3.9883,8.2148,6.6026,4.0721,0.9224,2.0135,6.1157,3.1264,0.9068,5.4892,0.1664,0.671,7.5426,3.2099,2.5556,3.5011,2.607,0.1966,4.7941,2.7249,3.2431,1.1876,3.7027,1.0438,6.1804,4.5019,0.2594,0.567,4.8598,0.8742,5.6845,2.3503,1.6917,2.1862,4.3741,5.6919,4.2433,1.7045,3.9598,2.5688,4.3759,1.3767,5.9077,5.2944,5.0442,5.9285,0.8176,5.4779,2.022,3.8543,2.3961,1.11,1.3655,4.9771,4.9058,1.3667,1.8765,4.6054,6.0407,6.8363,1.8651,3.539,5.0072,5.6676,2.0328,5.9302,0.5017,6.707,4.6618,4.0288,2.9828,2.924,0.0031,0.2692,4.236,1.6962,3.1007,1.472,7.6458,1.7063,5.691,0.5773,1.0083,4.4501,0.9046,5.5257,1.6769,4.8163,4.6102,1.0303,5.0185,4.0942,0.8421,3.6077,0.001,2.2413,3.4755,1.4085,1.9949,0.0004,4.7257,0.0192,0.0129,5.0053,2.7552,3.8098,0.0584,4.4295,0.0075,0.0006,0.0132,4.3226,5.5532,3.8171,3.8067,4.3179,0.9811,0.795,3.0892,1.1153,2.5584,1.0553,2.2721,2.3609,5.0808,0.4137,5.1056,1.9037,5.1763,2.7923,3.3098,3.9925,6.7025,3.9718,4.3618,3.6426,2.5114,0.8508,4.584,5.3565,4.8153,0.0028,5.7484,2.6816,0.5969,2.8217,4.7464,3.1131,2.2404,3.7842,0.0084,2.086,4.4392,5.1679,4.0282,4.3168,3.0456,5.1648,6.1837,1.71,0.1994,0.6715,3.3063,1.5565,4.464,4.1369,5.252,2.8752,2.8314,4.7424,2.4449,0.1277,1.1936,0.0001,5.1721,5.6735,0.6986,1.3074,0.0006,0.011,0.0057,0.0002,3.6606,3.6446,0.0768,4.8567,2.0757,1.9363,3.1366,0.4958,3.5389,3.9022,0.076,0.0882,5.1559,5.9234,0.8801,5.9413,2.4574,0.0042,5.2112,2.9238,1.9121,3.1976,3.6477,4.3589,0.1034,0.0069,0.0016,4.6399,1.5201,4.4959,1.2695,3.7487,3.7894,0.0027,1.9069,4.9852,3.6907,3.6427,0.8312,5.4169,1.4691,1.1131,4.9128,0.0564,2.7324,5.0758,2.4043,1.1954,3.76,0.0931,0.6084,4.8769,4.5461,3.2825,1.3683,5.5774,1.9373,1.4603,3.7416,1.1379,5.464,5.3492,3.5296,3.2114,2.7713,1.3684,0.0352,3.3783,5.1821,1.9113,0.1281,2.1731,1.6069,4.3169,0.0562,1.407,1.586,0.7127,0.0012,0.0004,0.1835,0.2317,5.4866,0.7848,1.4499,0.0001,3.5865,1.2983,4.941,0.8524,5.4168,0.0354,1.5588,2.2862,0.0814,1.0269,2.1604,3.5595,5.0413,1.2313,4.2173,2.1723,1.6521,1.5939,4.9596,2.4687,3.9099,0.3116,5.1489,2.0672,2.5311,3.9994,1.1885,1.3951,0.8993,1.6227,3.2364,1.8711,0.558,0.7048,4.1627,0.4996,5.4279,0.0131,2.6458,4.5822,1.6062,5.272,0.9205,3.7884,0.0191,2.1502,5.2325,3.3935,0.8103,0.7603,3.4454,5.0415,0.0156,0.3526,5.4751,1.0295,0.2599,1.1298,1.8757,3.0833,1.1186,3.6333,0.0362,0.833,5.2815,1.7186,2.3543,4.6965,1.3496,5.2068,3.2626,1.4984,2.9302,2.1407,4.1779,3.8334,6.6221,5.6249,4.9639,0.1262,5.6426,5.0391,4.0,0.5498,4.0483,3.5281,4.9971,3.8155,2.0527,1.4619,0.6449,2.1513,3.3368,4.9741,0.0531,4.9526,1.114,5.9158,0.8218,2.9224,2.8235,0.8157,0.848,0.858,2.9119,0.2448,2.511,5.5703,5.6714,5.697,5.2002,4.8785,0.0073,1.4263,5.1349,1.0307,1.2785,2.6458,2.7288,3.3232,2.299,0.1115,2.4921,2.469,6.2207,1.132,4.3255,0.0038,0.0036,4.088,3.6763,1.7974,1.9893,5.7048,2.5609,0.13,1.9618,3.6003,0.8016,5.0987,1.6786,0.139,4.33,1.6798,1.1841,3.7007,2.0365,0.0018,4.2514,2.0831,1.0239,2.4237,4.5637,3.3483,0.4274,2.1243,0.006,0.9078,1.876,0.1894,4.4909,5.4395,0.3395,1.1619,6.8338,0.8528,2.3717,3.7891,4.7948,5.248,0.8602,5.7414,2.5892,3.1341,0.1356,2.5128,3.1572,1.997,1.2169,2.8363,0.3317,0.0519,3.3532,3.1767,1.2455,3.8325,1.5857,3.5398,1.9132,0.0032,0.0037,3.2236,7.5513,0.6853,0.0211,1.931,4.494,1.3247,2.3814,4.9773,1.9837,0.0079,0.2973,2.8618,0.3343,2.7225,5.0108,3.4888,3.4181,3.6052,3.0914,2.3908,5.4988,3.9201,0.6281,2.8152,1.946,5.2838,2.8468,1.5563,2.9376,0.3988,0.13,0.1446,0.0001,5.0932,0.5222,0.0318,0.0009,0.001,0.0033,0.0001,5.5788,0.3083,5.1157,0.8113,2.89,2.5871,4.1713,0.1809,0.3588,1.3019,6.4665,0.9334,5.0693,0.1929,0.8543,4.4538,2.653,1.6677,5.6143,1.8521,1.2012,0.9231,2.3307,3.0041,0.8408,6.0692,1.8445,3.625,3.8318,0.8481,4.1766,3.4902,0.0117,0.0062,1.2448,0.4339,0.0009,0.0009,3.2062,1.0091,1.3321,2.8516,4.8069,0.0557,4.267,0.1162,0.0238,1.6853,1.7608,0.7401,2.8799,1.0816,5.6582,4.4062,0.4366,3.5607,4.7969,5.3959,2.8508,2.0959,0.4555,1.8261,2.8526,0.3325,4.5026,0.872,1.019,2.4639,4.9878,1.9855,2.6151,3.113,1.776,2.3448,0.1275,0.5334,0.0001,4.645,3.8078,1.7364,1.7431,0.5375,2.2097,1.7581,0.0225,0.8175,5.9119,3.0896,0.818,0.8241,5.8027,1.0883,0.606,1.0942,1.8068,2.5257,5.831,0.0381,0.1138,0.5068,0.9788,2.8992,9.3427,0.127,1.6484,3.8424,3.3161,0.0736,3.4797,4.2809,5.6105,0.6802,1.6664,0.8051,3.5557,0.5712,4.5044,4.8132,0.6272,1.5103,2.6392,1.8809,1.7281,4.8378,0.2241,3.2996,2.3213,1.1206,1.3865,4.4879,1.1368,0.2717,2.6843,4.7546,4.4747,1.0026,1.585,2.0962,3.6295,3.6829,0.7859,5.2926,3.758,3.8712,0.8238,0.1144,0.5732,0.0001,3.0986,6.2201,0.2936,0.0005,0.0009]}
{"id":879,"ended":false,"length":613,"gen_text":"In 1952, the Icelandic airline Loftleidir was granted the concession to fly from Keflav\u00edk Airport outside Reykjav\u00edk to New York and Chicago in the United States, and to Oslo, Copenhagen and London in the North Atlantic in 1953, although they were not on the commercial aircraft line, for which they were also granted the license on the Norwegian government's own terms, and to fly from New York to New York on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean in 1954. This contract was cancelled after Lindstrom's jetliner company, Jetbunny, failed to obtain approval from Norwegian air traffic controllers and it became necessary to acquire the new jetliners that Lindstrom was to buy from Jetbunny in 1955 and the Finnish airline Saab would follow Lindstrom's advice to obtain the second pilot's license from Saab in 1957 for use on Norwegian flights. The Saab plane that carried Lindstrom's passenger group in 1956 became the second passenger jetliner to pass its certification tests, and the first to take off from Cape Town. In 1960, the first commercial passenger jetliner, the Saab LaRouche, ran with La Rouche's passenger squad, the Taffy Delta II and sold to Danish Air for \u20ac15 million. By 1966, the Danish airline CERPA was formed to serve as its charter airline, where they flew through the various airlines, operated with their crew (with the occasional exception of Iceland's airlines) and passengers. At the beginning of the 1970s, Taffy Delta II and LaRouche had a combined combined gross gross gross of over $400 million. As the airline's annual revenues rose, TaffyDelta II sold its seat-mates in Denmark to Norwegian Airlines, with the latter, then a joint venture between Norwegian and Taffy, continuing to fly for the remainder of that decade. One of the first large Norwegian Air passengers was the Danish Aerotech of H\u00f8ttg\u00f8r\u00e5d, who managed to purchase a seat under the alias Maillen Taffy V. The company was founded in 1976 by Norwegian company Maillen, who took ownership of the company for a period of almost ten years, until they moved it to Norway in 1981 to operate. Two years later, three passengers were shot and killed by a group of Norwegian security guards at the airport in \u00d8sterkund, including a Norwegian man who is currently serving several years for terrorist acts. This incident killed all seven of the passengers. A few years later, the Norwegian passenger guard died from his injuries in a stampede. In 1981, during an inspection by the airline, a new passenger arrived from Norway to arrive in Finland. The flight attendant said her family had found that there were two children living at the time, but she was unable to contact them. The two children were later found dead at a local cemetery, the father and the mother of them having both been killed by their own father (although her family was unknown) and the family had to take a bus from Oslo to Helsinki. After a brief investigation, no new passengers were in the country by 1995, except for a Norwegian woman who owned a hotel in Stockholm. It was she who found the bodies, but they were found in Finland in December 1995. Her family is currently not related to the Norwegian passenger guard who was killed on the plane.\n\n1 2","token_len":684,"entropy":[11.1927,0.2745,1.8605,10.27,8.3897,13.1457,6.999,7.4384,5.0808,2.5256,4.9965,2.2828,8.6519,1.5375,1.3879,3.0408,4.3706,5.6498,0.0733,2.7594,0.2823,2.8,6.4687,1.7948,0.0003,0.0019,0.322,0.0001,0.5229,5.2678,0.1757,3.3519,5.1375,3.6956,1.7307,2.1989,0.0386,1.9941,2.0812,1.8759,9.2844,1.6738,8.1264,0.7327,3.6854,0.8128,0.1357,3.0947,1.097,2.8386,3.5076,2.3116,4.4897,2.8033,1.3558,1.5508,4.5617,1.2389,5.6501,4.6202,5.1732,3.236,4.2268,1.509,0.6396,1.0701,4.2338,1.9898,1.1319,5.2132,4.2577,1.207,3.7571,3.9673,0.3526,2.9476,4.5893,2.7165,2.0,2.9405,1.3335,1.0357,3.3161,0.078,0.3358,2.4417,0.5651,2.5011,1.3577,5.2713,1.4421,0.2512,0.1015,0.4653,2.7277,1.7754,2.0035,0.4227,3.8009,5.3854,0.8362,3.1093,2.641,6.3114,3.8866,1.7662,6.1331,2.354,5.3356,1.4299,4.5116,5.0955,3.2294,0.3915,2.6452,0.1056,3.6839,2.9436,0.7388,4.8325,3.8856,1.0739,1.9653,2.923,4.8554,3.2517,2.9247,0.5666,4.6481,1.6478,4.5835,2.7641,1.5463,4.2442,2.9479,0.0005,2.1222,2.005,3.0074,1.6901,1.8554,0.1168,0.0002,2.0022,2.1911,3.3607,3.5431,5.5812,1.8442,5.453,1.6556,5.127,4.7323,5.6831,0.0006,0.3423,4.4918,2.0228,3.541,1.2911,5.4603,4.3898,1.6337,0.8453,2.2441,3.7008,0.0043,1.6624,2.1648,5.1876,4.5123,0.9522,3.9181,3.4032,0.7186,2.1948,3.5146,0.0034,3.4918,2.6482,4.4504,0.3552,0.0015,0.8853,4.9812,4.9213,3.6861,2.8659,3.1432,0.497,3.2553,3.3412,2.063,0.6991,1.1003,5.1568,5.0729,3.3276,2.2396,2.0216,1.2182,1.3955,0.9842,1.2011,3.8363,0.2217,0.5601,5.0556,1.7339,2.6032,2.7006,3.4446,0.368,1.0367,2.3027,3.2777,2.3061,0.8767,0.2798,1.7105,0.4076,3.942,0.0186,5.7577,3.0094,0.9188,0.5663,0.619,5.341,4.53,6.0557,7.3619,0.0242,1.6415,4.5543,5.8174,2.7652,2.7728,5.5897,5.8501,0.7584,5.9457,4.5153,3.2681,5.6862,0.9937,5.8512,3.3122,3.4483,3.7796,4.0094,0.6419,0.8384,4.0301,3.4418,0.2445,0.9777,5.247,1.4369,5.2012,5.1247,5.1304,1.9235,4.5757,1.5584,4.6343,1.2655,3.7246,4.4191,0.8573,1.1909,5.9368,3.5793,2.8945,5.4798,1.1619,5.4664,4.0283,2.3482,5.4315,3.9965,3.5154,5.6603,5.4599,3.6784,1.6484,5.4324,1.9122,0.0483,5.5049,1.6163,5.5737,1.8049,0.3677,5.3257,1.5226,4.449,0.7876,2.5128,0.0192,1.1535,1.2548,0.1429,0.2279,5.6273,0.2687,0.0012,0.4661,0.1345,2.0349,0.8264,1.8814,0.0005,0.0007,3.2184,2.3944,1.8103,4.2875,2.4247,2.4815,2.7742,0.7844,3.3702,2.1522,4.532,0.0617,1.217,4.3687,2.0866,2.2669,1.8903,5.3277,2.3458,3.1645,0.6649,2.1841,0.0019,0.0006,4.3594,0.0659,4.8127,2.0506,3.0842,2.9165,3.3444,2.8615,3.7891,1.0154,3.3323,3.62,1.1751,3.4611,1.1596,3.1427,4.1164,5.4271,3.0335,3.585,0.21,1.4546,1.4628,0.3979,2.4031,0.0188,0.0012,1.3253,4.2362,0.6229,1.9447,4.7822,1.8305,2.8622,0.0013,3.3464,0.644,0.3683,6.1569,0.4658,0.3427,1.6805,5.3428,2.5642,4.368,4.5891,2.1433,2.5454,2.7128,6.033,6.4153,5.0147,4.7097,1.7048,5.0386,5.2251,1.8819,2.4393,4.3903,2.3868,0.635,1.4917,5.8116,0.6719,4.5247,1.4414,1.6008,6.8502,0.7079,5.2442,5.9157,4.663,1.8403,4.6621,1.8237,0.0987,5.7982,2.9916,2.2068,2.9505,1.6334,2.8686,0.4674,4.2998,1.1914,3.1662,5.2386,4.7767,0.1819,0.0521,2.3366,2.196,4.8479,4.6235,0.246,0.4407,1.322,5.1328,1.7912,1.2691,0.3955,4.922,2.9812,0.0144,1.4655,2.7076,3.0391,4.146,3.5391,0.3254,3.5839,0.4212,2.5366,4.2706,2.6758,3.964,5.5469,0.9957,0.249,0.2772,6.1456,3.5601,1.3245,4.2062,1.3426,0.2449,1.2336,1.7658,2.1246,0.076,2.1827,2.4641,0.7283,1.8207,1.3481,1.7863,1.4237,4.5517,0.7578,1.4358,4.9332,2.6955,0.9089,5.8906,1.9726,1.1082,2.2881,1.3591,5.6418,3.2734,1.103,6.4597,0.6838,1.775,4.7898,2.9527,0.6592,4.1721,1.3528,5.5565,3.2294,3.8801,1.5093,0.2861,0.5908,1.594,3.606,2.8326,0.51,0.211,0.1373,1.8801,1.8963,5.5818,5.587,5.0752,2.4753,1.3948,0.3759,1.8997,1.0539,5.7444,0.0253,2.2753,1.8522,2.9764,0.1034,5.5757,2.8905,3.4451,3.0298,0.8758,3.4263,1.4814,1.8146,4.8452,1.8063,4.9345,1.834,2.9569,3.4379,5.6804,2.0461,5.7484,1.221,1.4036,4.4535,2.9194,4.1594,5.0447,3.5549,1.2165,5.1171,3.6648,3.6083,0.9679,2.8153,3.8405,4.0078,2.4149,0.2657,3.6249,1.4258,1.8157,2.1554,1.9774,1.9182,0.0031,4.1367,0.7716,1.2038,1.4877,4.2061,0.6026,1.1159,3.1597,0.9407,1.3385,2.0784,1.7308,2.654,3.4881,1.7733,3.478,4.4442,2.5582,1.3464,0.4591,1.8776,4.4966,2.6459,4.5084,0.6906,1.6121,1.4061,3.0986,1.6476,2.362,4.984,3.8746,3.8853,2.8002,2.6107,6.1994,3.853,0.7921,1.0682,3.0938,1.9279,3.3425,3.1015,2.3432,3.0278,2.8057,2.068,0.1327,1.629,1.3094,4.055,2.3903,2.8081,2.3798,0.6378,5.3263,3.7681,1.3858,0.6154,5.9347,0.6965,2.1261,4.2027,5.3966,1.099,5.2068,0.5015,1.5048,2.0524,1.9658,0.6951,6.0286,0.6127,4.0759,1.0139,3.2034,1.1223,4.1835,0.6336,5.188,0.2265,3.4154,0.8726,2.683,2.1482,1.7253,3.3145,0.5041,2.3267,1.8713,5.5278,2.5233,5.0281,1.2267,0.7065,4.5556,2.1563,3.8648,2.3073,5.1179,5.4654,0.1188,0.5183,2.4,2.425,0.1956,2.3718,0.9685,0.5914,4.404,1.0341,1.9543,0.5974,2.8648,0.0253,5.8617,4.6465]}
{"id":985,"ended":false,"length":650,"gen_text":"After the closure of Looking Glass, certain employees of that company moved to developer Mad Doc Software, and they hoped to complete Jane's Attack Squadron. The game's original lead designer, Andrew Wright, was replaced by Christopher Shaver, who previously worked at Microsoft, Microsoft Office and Netscape. Many people are also wondering how those two projects actually worked to start the game.\n\nThis wasn't the first time that two developers had worked together during Visual Studio's first live release of the team.\n\nIn a blog post, Chris Johnson, who was originally on-site for World Builder for the Xbox One, said :\n\n\" In 2008, Chris had been working on development for Visual Basic 8 on a Macintosh at Microsoft since 2007. In 2008, he got on hand to talk about one of the features he wanted to provide, and that was the ability to do both game-injectors and multiplayer (both on a single-player map). He started the talk with what we called \"I can't imagine someone using something like the Internet to interact with their Xbox One during the game world... This might sound crazy for a game like World Builder, but there's not many people who would actually like that sort of functionality in Visual Basic when it is very convenient for a developer to do both game-injectors, and multiplayer (as well as the occasional multiplayer game).\"\n\nSo the game had been released just after Microsoft was closed, and both had been working on it on their own for months. The two teams had been working at the game development studio together for three years before Microsoft closed, and they went back-and-forth about what their team was trying to accomplish. The developers went as follows by email:\n\nThey're still looking for somebody who's worked with them at the beginning; they found the original 'Hey Chris! My name isn't Chris Johnson! So, where's Chris's project from? Let's go find someone for this project (I'm going to ask him out at a LAN this Weekend, and he's been saying that his name is Chris Johnson ) we could bring some friends together for a game, or not! We're at WorldBuilding.com today! So, Chris gave the link to that game I mentioned earlier. Let's see you guys play it!. He said he'd found this team. That is the first team that had ever worked together in Visual Basic 8, so we're starting over... OK, now let's take a look at what we are going to do, and then put that together to make it better for someone to play... so then we're going to try to fix that.

Instead of finishing the game, he felt he was missing his favorite things - and he wasn't exactly in a position to get the job done by the End of June.\n\nHowever, for those who saw lookingglass as a sad day, Johnson had a reason to celebrate. It was his birthday - and the next time you see him at Microsoft's New Year's Eve party, it might not be the worst day of his life to work with him.\n\n[Image via Flickr user pf]","token_len":686,"entropy":[2.3183,7.9369,0.4191,12.7603,0.2151,0.9961,9.5546,3.9493,3.7117,4.7719,0.861,5.6224,0.9382,10.7717,7.635,11.1713,8.792,1.0701,3.12,3.8397,6.6454,0.4906,5.6403,12.5427,0.8086,10.4768,10.6231,1.655,2.725,2.8326,2.3096,3.91,6.9169,0.5941,0.5865,5.102,6.0018,0.1418,1.6987,3.5141,0.4079,5.3316,5.9269,4.9328,0.5157,0.7893,5.2874,0.1344,1.9303,3.6265,2.5108,4.5259,3.9873,1.8684,5.2757,0.0013,0.3394,5.9649,3.3812,3.9386,4.705,2.7434,2.4195,5.194,1.4512,4.125,4.406,2.6125,5.761,3.246,2.5,1.2183,0.7374,0.7148,0.0006,4.2984,5.5016,0.0003,0.6382,0.3141,0.213,1.6758,5.4272,2.1224,1.4447,1.1997,0.6308,5.7913,6.8526,0.2574,2.1042,3.9575,5.8477,2.3958,2.7579,1.3448,5.3175,1.4214,2.8843,0.0003,2.4691,3.771,2.7162,0.052,1.4286,3.7323,5.8036,1.2867,2.0065,2.1969,3.5718,4.0814,5.0361,1.3841,1.911,6.6328,5.5563,4.0026,1.7465,3.1881,1.4049,0.8411,2.2683,7.7461,1.4832,0.0003,1.126,7.322,4.1958,0.6592,2.328,4.0627,1.7248,0.8949,0.6302,6.2473,1.0197,2.8996,3.3236,4.6472,3.1937,1.9803,5.7562,4.3738,0.9061,5.1269,3.1303,0.4764,2.6011,2.4378,0.3618,0.954,4.218,4.1056,5.3206,0.4888,2.5318,1.0278,5.9356,0.1952,0.6337,4.6618,1.3824,1.2774,0.1913,5.5744,2.9401,1.7399,3.1628,0.543,2.0096,1.2014,0.0876,4.2344,5.3572,4.0206,2.6063,3.9647,3.4955,4.3161,0.7263,4.7791,3.9654,4.1658,3.2772,2.1365,0.96,4.066,0.7037,5.2959,1.0277,2.1344,4.2382,3.3611,5.0883,1.6536,4.7117,2.5462,2.6005,1.9568,5.7349,4.4692,0.8999,4.2199,6.0171,3.7394,4.4839,0.4062,3.7007,5.2529,1.7529,5.7561,0.1611,3.3698,3.7368,0.9398,6.0978,2.2904,1.2192,4.6702,5.6109,4.343,5.6733,1.6919,2.5172,4.1491,1.1683,1.7262,2.1924,1.0913,0.0393,0.4452,0.065,4.0198,1.2415,4.281,3.6419,1.0037,1.138,2.484,2.8307,4.9853,1.932,3.8857,0.0009,2.4189,2.7655,3.1904,0.3846,5.6806,1.5908,3.0339,4.6231,4.9678,2.2403,2.4022,2.4497,0.7328,1.8741,2.5342,1.2617,0.1209,0.0675,0.0072,0.128,4.0707,0.752,0.0763,2.0248,3.5728,1.5811,0.4897,2.3847,5.4402,1.6157,2.014,2.0931,0.1672,0.0002,3.9763,3.4384,2.5186,3.6576,2.3847,3.3353,4.2289,3.6328,2.7489,3.4781,4.8245,1.5709,1.0575,5.1699,4.2953,1.3821,0.7924,0.5012,1.1453,4.6402,2.1102,0.456,1.6404,3.2309,0.4206,2.8449,3.5714,2.8689,1.9405,1.7536,0.7031,4.7266,1.8527,5.5149,2.5346,1.1055,4.8088,0.4791,4.2005,0.3021,2.7,2.897,1.5515,2.0522,0.6476,1.724,5.6943,1.8283,5.6425,0.61,0.0019,0.0003,2.0554,1.7194,3.6958,4.8415,1.8326,3.9049,0.0301,1.3077,0.7253,3.1581,3.1907,4.6705,3.9291,5.5501,6.732,2.9015,1.0611,0.0787,0.0003,5.7114,3.8728,3.3204,4.419,0.7556,5.6984,1.4102,2.2167,4.8286,1.6411,1.503,3.2903,2.0203,3.0578,5.9884,1.6698,5.8722,3.2841,3.9612,6.2246,5.1352,2.2421,3.0557,5.2675,0.4572,5.489,0.0012,0.3841,1.0424,3.0226,4.5561,2.6241,4.7007,2.0961,2.8061,4.5037,3.7175,4.3951,1.1279,4.6525,0.532,2.7014,2.8628,1.7236,4.4456,2.2896,1.6831,5.9384,3.1456,1.4017,3.4143,0.0527,2.9308,2.2002,5.2574,3.4379,2.1024,4.4783,5.0743,6.1305,2.0307,2.1491,1.5596,1.3684,3.7691,5.8799,1.8195,3.6641,0.8868,0.4239,0.9111,0.8131,6.626,5.7248,4.2796,5.1974,2.9774,4.085,2.027,2.4307,1.0056,1.9843,2.4966,2.4621,5.7168,3.4403,2.3224,1.7205,5.5807,5.9665,7.0717,1.6766,0.5383,4.0268,3.4446,3.6804,0.7415,3.9335,6.0765,3.8773,5.1678,0.6044,3.4839,2.289,4.2134,1.7635,1.6168,1.9115,5.6172,0.1835,2.5518,5.4296,1.2998,4.6221,1.1803,8.9116,3.6597,2.5963,1.5806,1.6824,5.4198,3.6601,5.0298,2.5924,4.4668,3.7001,2.2858,2.8334,3.8929,2.1964,3.5311,2.4454,0.8753,0.4754,2.8768,2.0018,0.7048,2.2829,2.0332,1.8979,1.7073,1.4313,5.0443,4.315,5.1533,5.6264,0.5888,3.3083,2.031,0.0366,4.5185,0.6621,0.4358,0.2957,1.5955,1.5089,3.5518,2.8853,0.0243,0.5419,2.9991,0.9829,2.7302,6.0033,2.3272,0.5538,3.5486,1.702,2.2212,3.1126,1.9882,5.7518,3.1972,1.2775,4.2612,4.76,5.6563,1.0618,1.7831,0.4268,0.0101,3.6558,0.6619,5.6237,2.4696,1.9601,4.613,2.0023,0.6185,0.4815,0.0042,1.841,0.2674,2.7627,5.0493,1.9221,5.9095,2.4442,0.8398,0.8362,2.4778,4.5071,2.0897,6.1161,3.6408,0.46,7.1267,1.0727,2.257,0.0002,5.7519,0.8352,1.0493,1.3059,1.1562,0.5368,1.1828,0.4436,4.7889,0.004,1.8583,0.7541,1.7152,0.2763,3.6844,1.7422,4.8429,0.4155,2.7014,5.7236,2.0512,0.2247,0.5803,6.2388,0.0824,5.3994,1.0225,0.2959,0.6425,0.2895,4.077,2.0135,1.5154,4.7903,3.3726,4.6726,3.551,3.5096,3.4441,1.713,4.0787,0.0008,4.9661,4.7103,1.478,1.8828,0.0508,3.6753,3.256,1.5707,0.1023,4.9709,1.2403,8.9671,0.6616,4.4804,0.3114,0.8542,0.0002,5.0416,0.0423,5.0148,1.9419,0.9274,5.1413,4.9343,2.0462,1.4518,0.7459,5.7617,1.9103,1.863,5.4292,3.0867,1.4152,5.7726,0.6381,2.7058,0.6118,3.935,0.833,2.6291,2.2343,3.6583,1.0471,2.4726,4.9083,3.3968,3.4429,1.2257,1.1666,2.2963,2.3399,2.3441,4.3755,2.7715,0.1596,0.5677,0.8612,0.3514,2.7532,2.8773,2.2522,0.2881,1.7898,5.1942,2.1284,0.376,0.8429,0.0533,3.8167,5.4896,1.711,1.8313,0.4714,0.5576,0.0002,5.0251,2.1836,1.2409,3.792,0.3262,5.4696,4.2975,4.2622]}
{"id":4693,"ended":true,"length":634,"gen_text":"Unhappy with how his NHL career ended, Fleury hired a personal trainer in February 2009 and began an attempt to return to the NHL. By August, he petitioned Commissioner Gary Bettman to allow him to play in the league. The request was ultimately rejected. Fleury retired in 2010.\n\nWith Fleury on the horizon and NHL free agency, the Bruins' organization has not fully made any major change. In fact, they have been unable to sign or re-sign any of their top guys.\n\nIt is a very odd situation for Boston. No team that can add players has actually made a new head coach since 2001. The Bruins have two top draft picks who were drafted first overall and have never made the playoffs for any major season.\n\nWith a team that already has a pretty good crop of talent at center, what makes the situation even more odd is the lack of depth in the Bruins' blue line. In its recent history, the Bruins have only played two big-bodied defensemen on the right side of the line. This has taken a toll on their player's stride.\n\nAs a result, Boston needs to make a ton of major roster moves to fill out their remaining depth. They have not signed any of their top prospects, although they have reportedly made a good use of the draft to nab Matt Read and Logan Couture.\n\nOne question with the way the Bruins moved is the fact that their third-line center position has been filled at the expense of those top forwards. Boston had a few depth moves during the offseason. The two top line centers from past three picks (Matt Hunwick and Brendan Gallagher) can be used in that role.\n\nIt is not hard to understand how a GM would go about building a team around a veteran. It would also be very difficult at the NHL level to find a young, solid scorer on your team that can play on the perimeter, where any team can't. At this point, though, there seems to be little question that the Bruins could be in a position to land one or two top netminder guys.\n\nWith that said, it would not be surprising if they moved right here. Boston had one of the best blue lines in the NHL in Mike Babcock. This isn't necessarily an issue for Bobby Ryan, who was the team's leading scorer from his NHL days and had one of the best year in franchise history with the Bruins. Ryan has the kind of chemistry that would make him a free agent after the 2017-2018 season.\n\nRegardless of who happens, it is hard to imagine Boston acquiring a first-line wing for that top center role. What does a player who is on his way back from a broken toe, to a serious injury, to rehab his injured toe look like? Let all of these players become part of the core that will hold up under the Bruins organization.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is a much smaller organization with the team that could make the moves

{"id":2148,"ended":false,"length":633,"gen_text":"As stars of at least 0 @. @ 4 M \u2609 exhaust their supply of hydrogen at their core, they start to fuse hydrogen in a shell outside the helium core. Their next test will show that they can fuse hydrogen using their natural uranium fuel.\n\nThe fact is that uranium is extremely reactive and therefore unstable and is difficult to contain. Nuclear fission is not a nuclear explosion, but nuclear fission is.\n\nTo understand the fission process, we can go through the hydrogen atom using a little more mathematics. We have to understand how the Fission Cycle works, and the hydrogen atom itself, since it is a natural uranium atom (it is more powerful and more expensive to make than CO2 but is only about 50% the cost with Fission Cycle ), and we can find out more about how it operates with a little more logic using simple formulas.\n\nOne interesting feature of this method is that we can create an atomic nucleus inside of uranium itself and use it as the fuel for fusion, meaning that the fission process has taken place outside of the helium core during the fusion period.\n\nFinally, we can make a spin cycle using helium. A spin cycle is defined in a set of equations that are as follows: spin = f ( k + \u03ba ) ( k + k_0 ) 1 ;\n\nThe first point (the radius) defines the orbit around the Fission Cycle, where the outer point f gives the radius and the inner point k is the orbit. The second point (the nucleus) is a spin cycle with a radius of k + \u03ba.\n\nThe fourth point (the tail length) is the rate at which the nuclei form - the fissile material the fission is made on, so in effect this radius is the distance between the nucleus fission cycle and the fuel being produced.\n\nThe fifth point (the speed of light) is the charge that takes away the neutron radiation that is generated through the fusion process over a short period of time. This is the speed of light with respect to the energy that is generated by hydrogen per mole of gas (the mass of a star, or of any other substance at all).\n\nFinally, the last point of the form (the speed of light with respect to the fission energy) is the speed at which the Fission Cycle is complete (the acceleration of the fuel at a distance greater than the speed of light with respect to it).\n\nAfter many tests using more than 1 hour of Fission Cycle time with enough of it, it is very likely that it will be quite short, that it will generate sufficiently energy for a short time, that there will be a complete meltdown, and that it will reach a constant energy rate of about two times the amount of Fission Cycle.\n\nIt also seems clear that fission in general requires at least 10 cycles to complete\n\nAt this point, we have a good idea what to produce with our fissions - and how to make one in our laboratory.\n\nReferences \u2013 The main online source for more information about the fundamental nature of fission is Fermilab.

{"id":3368,"ended":false,"length":596,"gen_text":"In addition to its lyrical content, many writers have commented on the thematic significance of Illmatic's musical endowments. \u201c Drawing on everything from old school hip @ - @ hop, to contemporary's own works in the '80s and '90s, Illmatic creates songs in response to the most prevalent trends in hip hop: the way 'em have become the latest form of youth music, but with an entirely new focus on originality and personal freedom.\n\nThe author is currently writing a book about hip hop and the contemporary music scene where he explores the ways and forms of music and the social context created by the past decade. This book will feature:\n\nthe most contemporary images and sounds of hip hop on a large scale since 2007.\n\nthe relationship the artists of 2016 and 2017 have made to the contemporary music world.\n\nthe connections that hip hop has with other dance forms like electronica, techno, and dance beat 'em together.\n\nIllmatic's 'I Know Love' cover of an upcoming video for 'Prophecy', based on Illmatic's 'Hands Up', will feature remixes by T.I, DJ D.E.B., and some new artists who share themes based on the inspiration of their music.\n\nIllmatic says,'the way these artists present themselves in their music creates an atmosphere so different from the rest of the music market that the current trends'are just more of the same.' As an artist, we're seeing more and more artists make their mark in hip hop, even if the originality is lost or blurred. Illmatic hopes to bring to the spotlight those artists and inspire more of their fans to step up and get involved, and create their creative lives using hip hop on mainstream and independent media alike. I feel that I know my fans better than any of their peers in what they're doing with me online. I do my part to help them live their lives, to make them part of something bigger, and to make sure their future is just as exciting for them as mine.'\n\nIllmatic is currently available for preorder on its AppStore.\n\nIllmatic, currently in production on a music project called 'The Love Story of Hip Hop', will premiere at a New York premiere of 'This Changes Everything', a new show about hip hop featuring original songs, artwork and collaborations from several of the year's most innovative and acclaimed artists. Fans on the show's Facebook page will also be able to discover exclusive photos, interviews and performances from the entire series and listen to it live below. For some of the stories of this podcast, see the short synopsis and the cover story.\n\nIllmatic will also tour and expand its worldwide distribution to record company WME Media and other major labels.

{"id":225,"ended":true,"length":672,"gen_text":"Nicole had a brief relationship with Penn Graham ( Christian Clark ) and after he was murdered, she discovered that she was pregnant with his child. James told Sunrise that viewers could expect \"bastard\" stories for the new season and that the show would explore how these women deal with their own anxieties about marriage, trust and the love for one another online. The episode centers around Christina and Natalie's recent relationship and is entitled \" My life has changed.\"\n\nThe season 3 opener \"A Kiss for the Tits\" takes place four years after \"The Hunger Games\", but is also the first time that the relationship between Charles and Molly will feature a woman who can share the same secrets; Charles never knew that Molly was married to a woman, but did learn the fact from a friend that Molly was a member of the National Enquirer (which was created by his parents).\n\nThe second episode, entitled \" A Million Dollars, Million Tears,\" revolves around a woman named Jessica who uses her role as an escort to work her way through life. It's called \" A Million Dollar Million Splatter,\" and is based on the reality show \"A Million Dollars, Million Tears,\" from the 2000s set, with the women of the American sitcom based on real life. It opens with Jessica being asked if she is interested in some \"fantasy jewelry\" (she tells him she is only twenty-one, then offers to sell her money). The relationship develops and starts to get serious over the next couple of seasons, and it becomes clear that Jessica is more curious as to how James plans out a life. The two partners are introduced by a local woman named Carol, who has also worked with Charles as a bartender and as a sex educator. He gives her a massage, makes her drink \"a very sensual and well-dressed manly beverage,\" which she then drinks with him. The pair is eventually moved to a bed that covers their privacy, and then on to separate bedrooms (each bed has a different set of sheets). There she sleeps, and with no one saying goodbye, he is left alone for the next half hour.\n\nThe season 4 premieres on Fox on September 11.\n\nOn March 23, Season 2 Premiere Day was released with an episode celebrating \"American Mystery Science Theater 3000\", and was originally scheduled to appear on December 1, 2013. There is a teaser from Season 3 below, where it mentions that the upcoming show will feature a story about three young women who go to Vegas to get rich, live in Los Angeles and, later, \"live some of their high school years.\" The story appears in the premiere episode.\n\nSeason 5 is on October 14, and the series debuted on September 8 at the Cannes Film Festival. It has two additional episodes, all titled \" A New World,\" titled \" The Great Escape,\" and \" The Grand Experiment.\"\n\n\"A Million Dollars, Million Tears\" was released a year after the death of the show's original creator and creator Peter Levitz in 2010.

{"id":15,"ended":true,"length":670,"gen_text":"With the losing continuing, more rumors began to surface. Unlike before, the rumors were about player moves rather than coaching changes. The majority of rumors were that the Blue Jackets would not re-sign Marc-Andre Fleury or Ryan Johansen, but there was concern because of the impending return of Alexander Semin, Patrick Roy and Michael Foligno to the organization. All this could be seen as another sign of how little time has passed for management to finally let this matter play out.\nThis is yet another sign of the declining fortunes of this young team. However, it is interesting to ponder the current state of the NHL playoffs. This year's regular season was one thing, but this year's NHL playoffs are another. It has since turned into a long list of the worst things that can happen to this organization.\nWith what appears to be a slow start to the upcoming season, the Blue Jackets are expected to start off the season 4-2-1, and win the conference finals. They won't have to go through a very difficult road to get there, however, as they are expected to stay in the playoff race, as they will finish tied for first on the West. As for the prospects of the team moving up after the regular season, there are just too many to list here, the worst being one of the best youngsters in the sport playing for a great franchise.\nThe best thing is for them to put their trust in the young players, and they need to make every effort to prove the commitment they have made in winning the Eastern Conference Cup. Despite having had some inconsistent play over the last few seasons, they have done a very good job of doing so. If the team comes back stronger, then they can play a lot better.\nThe Blue Jackets have had this team for a long time, even when they were in their very beginnings. They have been a great club with great players, always challenging fans. The young defense has gotten better under those same leaderships, and they are winning. The coaching staff has been great under those same staffs, having given them some good coaching during the first year of the NHLPA regime; and their defense has been pretty bad at times.\nThe question is where the next step will be. This isn't necessarily a team looking to stay in the playoffs, rather it is one looking to grow their team. That is certainly the intention with management at this time. However, if the Blue Jackets move to the Stanley Cup playoffs, then this organization loses hope of finishing the season 1-3 with a 7-2 record, the worst finish in playoff history. The organization needs to come out and play hard if it is going to stay good, and if they can, they should at least have the grit needed to make it this far.\nAs can be seen above, the organization is on hold awaiting a decision on who will play for the franchise during the season, and that is something to keep an eye on. In the meantime, let's hope there are a few players that are not in the organization by 2018, that have a future under their belts in their NHL teams. It would be awesome to see how many players could be ready in the beginning of season two, and if some of them can move on, which it may not yet be, then it could be a nice season to hold off on to.\nWith that said, let's continue reading on the Blue

{"id":112,"ended":false,"length":649,"gen_text":"With the censorship of Polish theater ( and the virtual end of the Polish radio and film industry ), underground theaters were created, primarily in Warsaw and Krak\u00f3w, with shows presented in English and Polish languages. Today the underground theaters provide opportunities for many actors of all ages to play in films and film collections for films that are never released to the public.\n\nThere is a new industry of Polish theater that offers an easy way for Poles to express themselves without having to hide and live inside the theaters.\n\nIt is a very good idea to visit Polish theater at all times to find out about the movies that are being produced there. The Polish theater will have many different rooms available to you including various art pieces, photographs, and pictures of original theater props, with a view into the theater. If you want to see more than one kind of movie, you can purchase a separate group with your group membership or with the director (or other acting member) who is responsible for your group membership.\n\nIn addition, there are plenty of theater companies and the director who is making the show can be very helpful as it allows you to enjoy yourself in a way that you don't have to feel alone and to have a good experience with the movie.\n\nWe encourage your members to show appreciation for the beautiful Polish theater, to give thanks to all the members, to see the work in the theater, and then to send a message to their peers, who are the best friends and family members of the theater group.\n\n\nMozart Theater in Warsaw is a Polish cinema with a huge history and unique unique history. It was the main location for Poland's theatrical and artistic history, when the cinema was first opened in 1933, then as recently as 1990. During this time, many films were produced for the Polish audience, at the beginning of the 20th Century, but never released in Poland.\n\nIn this sense, the theaters were very important to Poland's cultural history. They provided the source of the culture of the Polish language, the history of the theatre, and with this, developed the idea of public art, exhibitions, performances of Polish films, exhibitionism and, most of all, theatre itself. The theater was the major source of new information about Polish culture that was never translated into English without the original Polish people's understanding.\n\n\"This new kind of theatre is one of the things that is important for us today,\" said Kiarosti Savar, director of the theater. The theater is the first of its kind in Poland.\n\nThe theater's audience is well aware of new work that was made since the last time the theater opened.\n\nThe theater is always open after two weeks so that more time is spent with its visitors. The theatre is a very good addition to all of our visitors' tour, it also serves the public much better than the theaters of other countries.\n\nA theatre for everyone can be found in a large, open space, with an outdoor theater nearby and a small cafe, in front of the Theatre for Polish Theatre (PWYTC).\n\nThe Polish theater is also known as the cinema of the Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w, and Zweslau (also known as the French theater). It also was known as a \"sketch.\"\n\nSee the tour of the Oskarik theater here.\n\n[Images via Flickr user zerobay]","token_len":699,"entropy":[2.3156,11.5427,1.5069,9.9829,8.107,5.2397,7.9472,2.0834,9.1789,8.678,0.4093,1.3628,2.5686,6.9727,2.6265,4.3757,1.0916,2.2373,9.3572,4.4209,2.4706,4.43,2.2359,5.7992,1.2797,2.6972,1.436,3.0598,0.0137,1.6265,0.0009,1.424,3.3001,8.3164,7.1595,1.6681,3.2783,1.3271,0.5425,5.0711,0.5451,5.1274,3.0091,3.3607,2.6918,4.8159,5.7022,0.3001,4.6814,4.8008,3.8812,1.3636,0.9712,0.9004,3.0785,1.507,4.3745,1.4738,5.4684,5.912,4.7627,5.7071,2.6527,1.1875,5.3623,2.2836,2.1523,0.3116,0.1819,0.3814,1.1648,0.0505,4.1945,1.66,1.2566,4.7153,4.9329,1.704,2.7262,1.6773,3.1648,3.4791,3.0772,4.9013,0.7788,1.4404,4.3052,0.1845,4.6011,0.825,3.5104,2.0854,0.0127,5.0969,4.5163,4.5437,5.4821,1.4796,3.4052,0.435,2.2335,0.0002,4.749,0.5574,2.5951,3.1173,3.2099,1.0426,0.3416,3.7726,2.4511,1.204,4.0727,2.6235,0.4205,2.4401,2.8992,0.2108,2.0211,1.277,5.5169,1.8853,0.7753,1.3377,2.9734,1.7556,0.5021,2.789,2.032,1.0102,3.7452,2.6421,3.2495,1.9258,5.0663,4.0878,1.6884,0.6745,5.5938,5.4209,4.748,5.8967,0.7247,5.1515,0.4013,2.1229,4.2465,1.0199,5.9686,3.1515,5.5889,2.053,5.1263,2.3489,3.3192,3.2707,0.5136,2.5274,1.5407,3.8715,0.1276,1.9913,0.1015,1.5282,2.7099,2.7455,0.2377,4.9205,0.0218,2.0383,0.7596,0.8949,0.5361,3.8119,1.5408,3.5582,5.426,5.174,3.2036,1.778,1.4629,3.7427,3.7302,2.2165,4.7974,4.2624,1.691,3.226,5.6071,4.2051,0.6935,2.2059,1.7018,1.8194,0.0339,2.7534,1.0591,1.0018,0.3204,0.7621,0.0002,3.2398,1.538,0.872,1.9575,0.4474,5.4265,0.0153,4.2813,4.4821,2.9267,4.3085,4.2837,1.5068,1.7531,4.8949,0.8052,4.2947,2.4056,2.5107,3.8608,0.3966,3.2955,4.0004,2.7886,0.4849,0.0457,4.4851,4.581,1.7309,1.8488,3.637,0.4627,1.7359,2.9685,0.0026,1.2964,0.109,5.3466,2.2289,2.6168,3.4669,2.8275,1.3077,2.5943,1.86,2.0827,0.7463,3.0494,0.4961,0.6576,0.0002,4.5729,4.1069,5.1425,3.5226,0.1651,4.5831,4.3772,1.3581,1.0533,5.8562,1.1748,1.2738,2.3395,3.6168,3.8758,2.9977,0.7462,3.6722,0.8658,3.5821,2.1285,1.5733,4.1564,1.0383,4.0253,3.5901,1.914,1.5976,0.8334,0.5989,5.9807,0.8955,4.8926,2.1231,1.4996,0.9838,3.5183,4.4923,2.9284,2.8489,1.5902,4.2892,2.9754,3.0638,1.9316,3.5758,1.2683,0.5471,0.7534,0.8991,6.1904,0.4045,4.9303,0.0003,5.6023,4.8659,1.9325,4.1517,2.4237,0.9801,3.1378,1.2483,2.4692,3.5812,2.7954,1.2221,4.1871,3.5464,1.3695,4.8219,4.6449,3.5857,0.7773,1.7122,1.6801,3.1463,3.8157,3.5472,0.9286,4.9547,0.0987,4.5306,2.9004,3.7078,1.8686,1.961,4.7461,1.5635,4.8948,0.7292,2.0407,0.7795,0.6938,4.7736,2.3486,5.0241,3.8855,3.4432,0.0062,4.0588,0.3212,4.6838,2.0296,0.3131,0.5453,3.2645,3.3791,0.773,2.1049,4.0186,1.4061,0.9548,2.2295,1.1058,5.8596,1.4531,3.5799,0.2333,0.5481,1.3735,0.0126,2.1796,1.1725,2.1333,4.6074,2.6306,2.7652,1.1964,0.5175,1.6529,0.0002,2.6901,3.7206,5.0518,0.1316,1.1585,5.8723,2.3613,3.2945,1.0046,1.3731,1.8776,1.353,2.8226,1.5141,1.1211,2.3333,2.7524,1.8931,5.1686,0.9793,1.9456,3.8166,1.6323,0.5441,1.4462,4.3429,0.9259,1.7774,3.5724,0.1932,0.8188,3.8012,0.685,0.8579,6.1263,1.8726,1.3018,5.7997,1.1105,4.5951,0.2525,5.7724,2.6017,1.8419,5.143,0.256,3.2685,3.0514,2.5198,1.7378,0.3871,6.3125,2.4883,1.6002,5.4362,1.9327,2.4049,0.0019,0.03,4.7258,4.2519,0.1333,2.5858,2.1199,1.3035,2.1315,4.7238,2.0538,0.1535,5.3306,4.5818,1.2316,0.9446,1.5635,4.3771,1.3371,4.3646,4.173,0.36,0.3816,6.69,1.7222,6.5502,1.1111,4.611,1.3265,3.3974,0.6774,0.585,0.0002,5.7167,4.194,4.3345,4.3801,0.0022,2.4163,1.4315,4.1037,0.465,0.1724,3.5249,0.2939,2.5754,3.3594,1.2567,2.2073,3.5983,2.3868,0.9827,4.2372,5.5113,0.3635,2.4453,5.8853,4.5111,1.7385,1.868,0.1968,0.3846,4.0568,0.8855,4.2313,1.6214,1.5406,3.0229,2.4246,2.3386,0.5401,0.0184,0.418,0.5361,1.3103,1.0348,0.0002,1.7555,1.7782,3.444,5.5728,1.3464,4.9331,3.0062,0.2815,6.0232,5.292,1.9687,2.9322,1.6874,4.7232,0.7274,5.1908,1.2111,1.8039,0.4834,1.017,0.9016,2.5274,0.0002,1.7163,1.0911,1.355,4.9307,1.3832,5.1668,4.7431,2.7225,4.7469,0.7191,6.1255,4.2248,1.2879,1.5136,2.2957,3.6654,4.0467,0.4653,2.2346,3.3764,1.2555,2.6834,2.1445,2.0944,5.368,0.1406,4.7942,2.4848,1.6143,4.2475,1.1725,4.4033,2.3559,4.1865,3.5841,2.717,3.1958,3.5814,4.8322,0.2921,0.6868,1.4776,3.9951,2.8023,1.5366,1.9512,0.4308,0.4893,0.0002,4.1711,5.8377,4.4711,3.2642,2.7976,0.2622,1.5678,0.65,3.0912,2.8908,3.1241,3.2066,1.2126,2.1522,1.9798,3.2013,3.1382,2.8243,6.4345,3.1372,0.9821,2.9187,5.1469,2.5641,3.7027,2.502,0.0753,0.3307,5.9895,4.0933,2.3202,3.4169,3.085,3.9188,4.9412,4.7595,5.7218,1.0227,1.0842,0.0002,1.7822,2.7245,0.9456,0.9306,2.6241,3.006,0.499,0.8569,5.6456,1.2396,0.8748,3.0818,3.1731,2.4576,0.0327,0.1327,0.0017,0.422,1.182,4.0124,1.9448,5.8224,3.9166,4.2644,3.5414,4.2665,0.6174,0.0324,0.7482,6.5468,1.6419,1.2429,1.8325,3.7837,4.1814,3.0712,0.3535,2.5312,3.9697,5.1092,3.781,0.3523,5.9151,1.0023,0.0002,5.8588,1.7794,5.9216,1.186,0.5877,6.8386,3.6573,0.1644,4.7636,2.168,2.6156,0.7357,0.5535,0.0002,5.6761,5.0612,1.9605,4.7033,1.0598,4.342,4.6203,4.349,5.5695,2.1765]}
{"id":401,"ended":true,"length":657,"gen_text":"In contrast to their British counterparts, the French Navy was in a state of confusion. Although the quality of the fleet's ships was high, the fleet hierarchy was riven by the lack of command in that part of the fleet.\nIt was only during the second half of the 20th century that the French navy officially began to build a new navy to accommodate their newly minted navy of warships. The French Navy's main duty began in 2040 with the formation of its first fleet during the early 1940s, and continued through much of the 1950s and 1960s, when they began the initial phase of construction of new warships. This new navy has many of the capabilities of the French Navy, particularly because it offers a large fleet of light naval fighting boat types. A few of which include heavy bombers or heavy cruisers. As a result, the French ships are the smallest in military size at some dates but have an even heavier arsenal, especially during the cold war era and the period from 1945 to 1968, when there was a global war and the United States had launched a large cruise missile attack against Russian aircraft.\nFinally, the French navy is capable of transporting and flying large groups of German submarines, which are a direct consequence of the large size of their fleets. Additionally, they are highly resistant to the North Korean nuclear threat, and even if they could be destroyed by an atomic missile strike, then these were the only things France could do to make the navy strong and flexible enough to withstand those threats.\nOne notable exception to this rule is the French Navy that has always maintained a long-range amphibious assault, known as an amphibious reconnaissance submarine. The Italian navy, the oldest navy in Europe after the Napoleonic Wars, would also carry out a full-scale amphibious assault, but with an older and smaller force, such as the Spanish Navy.\nThis Navy, along with other large vessels, may fit extremely well into a French naval budget. However, for this type of naval warfare, the budget of each fleet must be set at least in part to accommodate France's new naval warfare needs.\nWhen choosing an Admiral, the first thing you should do is select the one to be given the most attention. By choosing a very high command level, you are helping to put a strong, strategic, and powerful force on the battlefield, with a mission and role to fulfill in the conflict that must arise.\nIf you wish, you may also consider using the latest naval commanders to help choose the right vessel of your design. A few additional guidelines should be made concerning the Navy commander, including the level of naval capability needed, the number of weapons and ammunition types and training needed, and the type and number of air wing systems (fuselage, landing section, cockpit).\nOne other important consideration is the type of aircraft (especially aircraft that can hold enough aircrew on board at one time ). This is also important if you are considering a full-size amphibious assault, such as a long tank or a medium-sized boat. Other aircraft for naval warfare are, for instance, aircraft such as the E-2 stealth bomber.\nMany of the French Navy units had a large combat force, most notably the two large warships, such as the large cruiser RQ-7 and LPR-1.\nIn addition, the French Navy has a small fleet of two large amphibious assault vessels, such as the small frigates LPR-90E or LPR-90R.","token_len":706,"entropy":[9.5127,1.4842,4.3405,7.4955,0.4259,0.1985,1.3578,3.8631,7.6508,2.773,4.1216,1.7345,2.2036,0.0024,4.6605,1.6487,4.4405,1.515,9.2729,0.1341,1.018,4.7992,3.0641,3.2293,0.88,4.3117,0.3021,1.3739,4.3855,9.0661,0.6809,8.689,0.1927,0.5574,3.1341,3.9597,0.0069,5.4745,3.7968,5.4941,1.4693,0.0041,0.2408,3.0416,0.5096,2.1406,7.7895,0.6285,2.881,3.1044,0.3219,2.8758,0.6981,0.0035,0.2459,1.3841,0.0136,0.1286,0.4706,0.7129,0.6174,2.7169,4.8727,1.6307,0.6699,4.6736,1.9929,2.0542,3.1007,3.6365,5.3508,2.1779,4.8068,3.9122,0.0004,3.1996,3.5903,2.6038,0.5845,1.5334,1.6382,0.8435,2.4903,3.5759,5.9009,7.1995,0.6698,4.754,4.0252,1.4565,0.6612,1.9417,0.0134,3.6435,1.6148,2.0803,6.1445,0.3286,4.7739,4.7561,0.1968,1.7681,1.8497,2.5769,1.4083,5.0419,0.0615,0.144,0.7683,0.0029,1.5703,0.4731,0.0008,2.2211,1.999,2.7257,1.8711,3.192,5.1594,3.0061,0.0635,2.6969,0.5879,3.2482,1.4415,0.7799,3.7408,2.2773,1.4193,4.5775,4.487,2.291,0.0627,6.5089,0.6188,0.4097,1.8356,0.5728,1.1439,4.8616,4.9531,1.0324,5.4186,1.5591,3.5493,2.2569,0.589,4.1322,4.5376,5.8074,7.0756,3.9807,1.5246,4.839,3.5683,1.4557,6.5808,3.1835,4.3621,4.144,4.9188,3.1591,2.2211,0.0002,0.8502,4.516,1.7764,0.29,0.4055,0.8091,0.3897,7.1619,1.3747,3.8954,5.3363,2.0517,5.9631,1.6679,3.6861,5.3837,5.4313,4.924,2.4085,3.4944,3.3253,5.6888,3.8659,2.5412,2.9312,2.929,0.3722,4.2364,0.0832,2.3097,3.5193,1.1561,4.2983,2.8833,2.6464,0.5024,3.3973,1.9963,0.1864,4.5943,0.6874,0.8535,4.95,0.7407,3.9711,1.0564,2.4555,0.0483,3.6182,4.5123,1.6326,3.2811,4.8551,0.0691,1.3002,1.3021,5.1313,3.3649,1.769,0.9519,6.1657,0.0822,1.0124,0.5583,1.8446,1.8937,4.3463,0.0273,5.1193,3.8043,5.9524,2.3226,5.2233,0.0786,6.0428,1.7173,1.5693,1.9515,1.3546,4.055,5.0391,2.1968,0.0054,0.6577,4.074,2.6002,0.1608,1.6441,2.2352,0.3651,5.708,0.023,2.5122,1.0745,4.3148,4.6582,0.0464,2.4828,5.2463,1.4736,2.4112,1.3957,1.1717,1.4306,5.0345,3.0659,0.9281,2.5732,2.2657,3.246,1.9243,2.9075,2.6501,4.0349,3.0241,0.2992,6.2295,5.5942,4.3879,2.4238,1.43,4.0082,4.4419,0.7682,1.3184,0.6037,4.677,1.6344,5.7324,3.6785,2.4389,5.688,0.8443,0.1125,1.7842,5.9604,1.3949,0.1479,0.8081,5.0055,4.0881,1.6461,0.6266,0.5406,2.1837,0.6869,0.2146,1.6311,0.9164,4.0412,1.9372,5.1299,2.2694,0.9861,4.711,1.0557,0.6373,5.0841,0.0065,1.0967,4.2821,3.8663,0.1207,3.6117,1.0708,0.05,5.2457,3.5145,0.559,1.8888,6.1137,2.1397,1.857,3.5059,4.6304,2.8917,0.2432,2.0284,5.3448,0.203,2.3352,0.0088,0.0003,1.136,0.1726,5.5335,2.8015,3.8606,0.6224,2.6307,3.9766,0.6015,0.2088,0.2926,0.0055,0.3662,1.8822,1.9929,3.2739,3.1723,5.0384,2.7153,2.829,2.8567,2.1534,3.8848,0.0688,0.5198,4.0411,1.6842,0.8293,1.1611,3.8678,4.9548,3.0042,2.8938,0.0009,2.611,3.5318,4.3156,0.9229,5.7347,6.1359,6.6552,0.0975,0.5487,2.4757,2.6969,2.7178,3.4207,0.9328,2.3301,0.0341,4.4108,3.5219,3.7851,0.0294,2.1618,2.5073,0.4313,1.3862,4.0808,2.3234,4.5989,3.3945,2.987,0.3858,5.0568,2.0083,1.8491,1.1704,0.2058,1.4507,2.123,3.5014,0.0413,3.2084,3.1463,3.859,2.6328,0.223,1.452,5.3186,4.4668,3.0163,5.403,0.6275,1.8151,2.9274,1.3608,1.7686,0.6508,1.1904,0.1666,4.0253,1.552,3.7865,4.1168,1.3335,5.4617,0.4788,1.9318,2.8428,0.5812,5.7368,2.2102,1.1797,4.5533,3.0547,6.5713,2.9095,0.5552,0.9821,2.2868,4.55,0.9233,4.7189,1.9796,3.3442,3.1323,5.6602,2.5874,0.2578,4.334,1.5987,1.8152,0.2425,1.1179,1.7505,4.21,1.5301,5.6746,3.6259,5.4066,1.0709,1.6337,2.5518,1.0998,5.5638,2.9551,5.3025,3.6274,0.4423,1.4134,3.436,0.4728,4.633,2.9359,0.2921,1.3886,1.2761,1.6993,4.3823,1.5208,5.4316,3.2026,5.6111,2.2729,2.4745,5.1249,1.1481,1.6602,4.2001,4.7384,0.5826,6.3382,0.4498,3.7906,2.5724,6.492,5.4681,3.0511,0.1642,3.7259,5.9227,1.029,4.2858,4.7195,2.1477,3.0044,1.3589,5.1153,0.1008,3.8423,5.0483,3.9865,1.7833,0.859,2.6108,0.05,5.3435,1.5976,2.9099,6.6069,2.2495,5.1685,3.5037,0.5495,0.6427,0.6866,2.056,2.0799,2.7977,0.0187,5.6205,5.8301,4.0076,4.0586,5.2203,0.4853,1.4117,4.3598,6.2128,0.3404,5.422,2.2358,0.5901,4.3776,3.5003,0.9786,0.9615,1.0418,1.0767,3.1762,0.2551,3.0778,4.9377,4.144,3.4382,2.7973,1.6063,6.013,5.1218,3.3687,2.4205,3.9269,0.1534,4.6185,3.1679,0.0498,8.556,2.7021,1.1131,3.8755,1.3616,2.9268,0.473,1.0781,2.0284,1.5371,4.8928,0.2028,2.3975,2.4441,0.0037,0.2957,1.3971,1.4451,0.0048,1.072,4.4138,8.5158,1.2909,1.2533,3.6028,1.9248,0.801,4.1621,0.5616,5.7618,3.9952,5.1613,4.7363,0.6541,2.046,4.2981,0.9597,2.6993,0.0605,3.3503,2.7917,0.0016,1.301,5.5494,0.9805,1.9896,4.5772,1.5592,2.5787,0.7714,4.8169,1.4586,0.3047,2.0891,0.8462,6.9973,5.3862,2.2911,2.6767,3.8939,3.2744,1.48,5.6824,0.9134,0.665,5.5306,3.9069,3.1298,1.3667,6.7571,0.0022,0.1386,5.9482,3.9918,5.9653,5.5467,0.2079,4.6629,1.6945,5.3959,5.7865,0.3501,2.0969,0.7014,2.4721,2.8531,1.1506,0.6333,1.2681,0.6988,0.3141,1.6983,1.3362,3.224,1.7085,0.3877,5.6721,1.9553,3.7412,0.0032,0.5557,1.6062,0.5341,3.3952,0.0019,0.1416,4.161,3.9104,0.0089,2.4197,1.868,0.0684,6.5578,7.4072,4.7777,0.3381,0.0723,0.0038,1.4547,3.748,0.4631]}
{"id":4083,"ended":false,"length":610,"gen_text":"Coral Springs is a sprawling city, with few tall or prominent structures. The tallest building in the city is a 12 story condominium ( Country Club Tower ), with five more buildings next to it. The tallest apartment building in Palma dal can be reached by car -- in other words, it would take up an hour to reach the tallest building in the city, Palma dal, but once on the peninsula, the car is relatively inexpensive. In all other ways, Palma dal is an elegant, tranquil landscape.\n\n\nWhen Palma dal got its name, its buildings were magnificent. The city has one of the biggest hotels (for foreigners who can afford the expensive hotels; for foreigners who can't afford expensive restaurants; for people with limited knowledge about palma dal's geography or history), and there's a large airport (more than 100 passenger terminals in Palma dal. The city also provides its own public transportation system). Palma dal is also known as the \"Golden Gate of China,\" a UNESCO World Heritage site. It has seen its fair share of development, particularly in the past 50 years, with a great number of small and medium-sized cities (including some of the largest urban clusters of the past 2,000 years).\n\n\nNowadays, the City of Palma dal's skyline has surpassed that of its historical counterpart, the World Trade Center, and its famous \"Coral Springs Hotel\" has gained an amazing architectural reputation.\n\n\nWhile Palma dal is a beautiful city, most people living at the Palma dal Tower don't know where it gets its name and where it belongs. The palma dal tower (and its many other landmark buildings) can be dated using the same number, so their exact dates aren't always exact. Palma dal can be reached at the Palm Court Hotel in Palma dal. It is also available at pala dal-tolga hotels on Troncaya Beach, which dates its history back to 2001 (see the map).\n\n\nA good walk may be found by taking Palma dal to the Mala\u00e7ay, or by walking the Palma dal Parkway, the Palma dal Plaza, and Palma dal Beach. While Palma dal is not exactly full of tourists, it does offer views of the world's tallest skyscrapers for a bit of time.\n\n\nPalma dal is known for its famous (sometimes) large restaurants and hotels. Palma dal is known for, and is very popular with, tourists, for its delicious palma dal soup and famous palma dal chowder that can be served warm or hot from time to time.\n\n\nPalma dal has two main attractions, all of which require drivers to take the road that leads south to Palm Beach, and all also require the use of several private vehicles. The oldest and most important of these cars are the Palma dal Town Cars (PAMC). The Palma dal Town Cars (PAMC) are used by the Palma dal Resort (also called PAME, or Pan Am) to get around the world.

{"id":4343,"ended":true,"length":634,"gen_text":"Prior to the arrival of Nancy, typhoon warnings were issued for much of Luzon. Many residents left for shelter prior to landfall. Typhoon Nancy passed through 10 provinces in the Philippines, but never landed in that province. According to reports, on Friday the agency sent a special-forces response with heavy weapons and fighters from the Joint Task Force in Leyte to assist the local residents as part of the evacuation. In addition, helicopters from the Kizuna Regional Defense Force (KRIDF) were deployed to assist in the evacuation operations.\n\n\nKariyanu: The Government of the Philippines is now seeking to provide humanitarian relief to affected victims with the use of humanitarian assistance. To this end, the Kariyanu Disaster Assistance Group announced on Friday, August 16, the creation of a'humanitarian partnership' to help local residents with a large influx of people leaving to the port in Bulacan province. These people will be offered food, medicines, shelter and water, and help moving between provinces.\n\n\nIn order to facilitate the humanitarian relief and reunification, the government will offer some of the key elements of a 'National Disaster Response Plan for 2017.' These include funds and personnel supplies for relief and assistance to the communities of the country. These details will be disclosed during the notification program next month.\n\n\nTo help those who have lost their loved ones, the Office of the Disaster Coordination Director will launch a 'National Emergency Fund' with money raised from international donors and government sources.\n\n\nOn September 7 the Agency of National Disaster Coordination (Odolu), which is dedicated to disaster relief and relief, announced it will support a total of 5,500 victims under the NDF, with the help of government and non-governmental organizations. NDF members and their organizations will receive a $40,000 donation from a donor.\n\n\nAlso on September 7, Odolu's Emergency Finance Ministry, where the Agency of National Disaster Coordination heads is headquartered, will provide the total of over 35 million pesos (US$8,000) per person to relief efforts.\n\n\nIn an official letter, Odolu noted the agency's 'commitment to the national security and humanitarian objectives of the Filipino people and the continued recovery efforts and the support of international law enforcement.'\n\n\nOdolu is also offering help with emergency communications. As is customary in all cases, the Agency for National and Federal Public Security (ODP) will supply emergency communications and services to the affected sectors of the country. This include the local community and non-governmental organizations, government agencies, and businesses that provide this assistance to the areas of the country affected.\n\n\nThe President is scheduled to meet with NDP Ministers from all the main parties for discussion after the visit of the two leading political parties. After these, the President will be accompanied by the State Council of Philippine Families and Coordinators for the People's Emergency.

{"id":945,"ended":false,"length":671,"gen_text":"The skyscraper at 100 McAllister began in 1920 with a plan formulated by Reverend Walter John Sherman to merge four of the largest Methodist Episcopal congregations in San Francisco, sell their various churches and homes and lease one or more of the towers as churches, apartments and other commercial properties for use in other church buildings. The plans also included a large private high-rise that would have included a new church, a building with an adjoining apartment, condominium units and a few hotels. During 1929 and 1932 the plan was approved by the City Council and approved in November 30, 1933. However, it was not until the following year that the city council approved it. On January 4, 1934, the City Council enacted its second ordinance prohibiting the use of any building or area over 100 with a population of more than 500, including one or more churches. The ordinance was effective on January 29, 1941. The building and area legislation provided that the City Council could not adopt any change in the terms, conditions and value of any property under its jurisdiction, and that the building and area legislation should be repealed on July 14, 1942.\n\nAs a part of the settlement agreement with the city of San Francisco on October 9, 1928, the new building, however, was renamed the \"Powett Square\" at 50 McAllister Street where the buildings would be sold to the general public which was set on the site of a former meeting house. In December 1942, the San Francisco Historic Preservation Commission (SAFF) designated the building as Historic Park and named it over the cemetery located directly below. The building as viewed from the park was opened in 1957, but it soon went out-of-business because of deterioration due to the construction of the fire, then caused a fire in the building. In 1961, in response to this \"revenge of war\" by a large amount of loot, a group of Jewish settlers brought a bulldozer to the area where the demolition was being done. However, the building remains there, and there was a temporary ban. The site was later used for housing, parks, entertainment, museums and other purposes, but during that time its occupancy became permanent. The development of the site was further restricted when an underground tunnel was installed on March 23, 1981, that permitted passage of underground plumbing. The tunnel was closed on May 29, 1993.\n\nIn addition to housing, the adjacent cemetery is home to numerous other important religious and cultural centers. Among these, the Temple Garden is home to the National Park Service, the Mission Bay Historical Society, the Church of the Holy Spirit, San Rafael Historical Society, the Church of the Reformation, the San Francisco Baptist Church, the Shrine of Justice, the Church of the Saints and the City College, the Museum of San Francisco. The burial ground for two of the Church's founders and members is located at 25 McAllister Street where they were buried. The Museum was one of the several private properties built after the collapse of the Mission Bay Railway in 1942, but no new buildings were built in it until 1989, when the historic park opened by the city to visitors.

{"id":4744,"ended":false,"length":666,"gen_text":"Limited running in practice and a wet qualifying session meant that teams had to improvise their strategies at the Hockenheimring. Fernando Alonso controlled much of the race from pole position, only relinquishing the final tenth spot in the standings for the first time in his career. Even though Alonso had held in the lead all season, his pace was never quite the same, and that's probably what he didn't want to change. Alonso took part in the first three race sessions of the campaign after coming up short of the team's three points, and the car he had driven all season was far from comfortable. The result was a much-needed win for the Spaniard with two victories in five starts. Alonso's victory, he said, came down to discipline, hard work and a strong team. A few of his best laps have come in last year's race, as more drivers have opted to try to stay out-the-way. Alonso also told F1 magazine that during the first half of the season, he often felt left out, meaning that he was not prepared to deal with a second flat-out lap. \"I've had a good race, but not in any way as good as the last two,\" he explained. \"If I'm honest, it has been a lot better than last year. But I didn't expect to give the best performance, and I feel good so far!\" Alonso has now had five starts under his belt, and his previous average finish was 6.1:0.\n\nHe's got the same approach over and over again. In 2015, the reigning WEC Le Mans champion gave up just seven consecutive races to come out-run the VLMS outfit, including a first pass in the first 15 km. The German had had a good weekend so far in Pirelli Park with an 8.7-second lead in Pirelli Performance cars, but that didn't keep him from setting the pace high. The VLMS finished 5th on F1's top speed chart, winning two of the weekend's races and one win per race when it was close, and still held on for the next three races. But Alonso's season, it was said, had been a bit of a disappointment. So many new cars were introduced at that stage of the season that the grid, in a rush, had to scramble to put new vehicles into place. Instead, the F1 paddock saw some exciting new additions, including the upcoming Ford Focus and the latest Honda Civic. The Focus won the first of these, but the Civic kept the team, and the new Honda also made new appointments for this weekend's races. The new Focus was named after a famous pilot who managed to kill two F1 cars from a group he'd just finished with. Ford drivers Mike Harvick and Danica Patrick, meanwhile, took the final nine points of the season, after winning seven races, one of which came at the Camp Le Mans race. The 2017 edition of Formula One was marred by a number of disappointing races, and there's growing sense the German may have just given up hope once again. \"He is a difficult-going driver, but I am sure he had a good weekend in terms of the season,\" said Kimi Raikkonen, teammate of Alonso. \"I think he has put in a good performance, and I am sure he is improving. But for now, I think things have a good chance of taking over in the next years, I am sure of that.\"","token_len":713,"entropy":[9.3778,4.6315,8.5312,3.175,3.4816,9.3401,7.7774,3.0581,7.4959,1.2177,4.3966,2.1504,0.5156,7.0382,0.0005,2.6875,3.3032,5.1247,1.1997,8.9757,2.8027,0.3412,0.0032,6.8045,1.1996,9.0359,1.1276,9.6653,5.6704,0.0737,0.1604,3.991,3.2936,3.6701,0.382,1.0262,5.3968,8.7849,0.0273,1.4587,4.0903,5.4291,2.686,2.0681,0.706,2.9574,3.4717,1.1255,1.0496,0.0324,1.0848,1.1168,0.3341,0.4381,5.3049,2.041,2.3673,2.2596,4.7465,4.7189,1.43,1.63,4.5348,1.2483,0.3705,2.3832,2.9254,1.259,4.5534,3.0609,2.8952,0.0401,2.232,0.898,4.4564,2.8053,4.1491,2.8599,4.211,4.5761,0.0004,1.7292,0.4684,4.2594,0.5192,3.8785,4.462,5.4783,0.0412,1.2766,2.5899,3.4067,4.6144,2.4309,1.6902,0.3669,4.7892,5.1895,5.324,2.7823,0.3344,2.7634,1.1712,4.6845,0.5701,4.5085,2.7156,1.9775,1.4615,2.7644,4.9221,3.8948,2.3394,4.0993,3.323,0.869,1.1186,5.2703,0.548,4.4685,0.9822,2.6415,4.0622,0.6821,1.1144,5.0314,1.9141,1.0003,2.0474,0.6213,1.3605,2.4526,0.0021,5.0853,4.0909,4.3888,1.522,3.6413,2.487,1.0629,3.0489,1.7152,4.5286,3.7171,5.2162,0.8542,0.1771,4.8097,2.5682,0.0311,5.677,1.5309,6.1155,0.285,0.4796,1.7539,3.9264,1.988,1.1191,5.2235,2.7544,3.2322,1.19,3.2879,0.9888,3.9826,2.012,1.1674,5.6913,1.2836,0.1267,2.4502,0.5677,3.8195,6.668,3.4327,0.871,4.9569,0.6225,3.6666,1.097,3.4292,2.3821,4.505,5.3335,0.0017,1.0635,2.074,2.7899,3.9718,5.1042,4.015,0.0394,2.7841,0.8648,6.1571,0.807,2.2988,2.3331,0.0617,0.3933,0.3883,0.777,0.642,5.6345,2.457,5.5488,0.441,2.9406,5.5947,0.9436,0.8646,1.9108,2.511,3.5054,0.869,4.7678,0.037,2.6999,5.3088,5.6386,3.2073,0.4475,4.3754,0.8389,1.4831,1.1207,3.107,2.2122,1.2886,3.0688,2.6549,1.8652,0.9967,3.483,2.9456,4.2159,0.8532,3.0613,0.5032,0.049,2.203,1.7148,2.1153,1.1785,0.5001,4.1328,0.2017,0.3836,3.9975,0.6904,1.877,4.9371,0.9425,2.3717,3.9924,0.7129,1.1317,2.7718,1.8985,1.338,1.3927,0.0822,0.7815,2.4366,1.1245,4.2035,0.0007,3.5998,1.4625,5.9334,2.4395,2.1071,2.4156,2.2698,1.4593,0.914,4.0282,4.1038,6.1404,0.0857,6.9356,2.2607,2.8917,3.7123,3.6529,3.4778,2.9354,3.128,0.1442,0.0086,1.0057,0.9252,2.7286,5.4994,5.8152,4.2469,1.2709,4.6541,0.6495,3.4601,4.4902,3.4287,1.0262,2.5604,0.0271,5.4059,2.383,3.8712,2.2957,2.7055,5.0424,6.1775,1.3271,0.0348,0.3953,1.3732,3.2275,3.6181,0.3548,2.9278,5.3155,4.9232,0.1392,6.42,0.0371,0.3838,4.947,1.2644,3.5749,3.9395,4.1893,3.0805,1.622,5.3775,2.1631,6.9855,4.2233,1.8159,5.4772,5.3393,1.2718,4.9174,1.5852,3.6084,1.5528,4.2397,6.2783,1.1954,0.9338,2.6012,5.6273,5.0369,1.4895,2.7606,4.1386,2.9975,4.9179,1.4537,2.8716,4.301,4.381,0.0009,2.5538,5.7785,1.0483,0.0034,2.7578,3.9008,3.8536,3.9581,0.8367,2.8868,1.5109,0.3593,1.7853,2.1257,3.7724,1.1545,0.0033,5.8028,5.7039,0.7356,0.8312,3.1703,3.197,0.0003,3.7521,0.3194,0.6453,4.4369,1.3555,0.8126,5.8197,1.3358,2.5898,3.0908,0.1092,0.0016,4.1499,3.5979,0.7515,3.2588,4.3745,0.0773,0.362,2.0237,3.77,1.7753,0.7936,6.0915,3.7377,1.6278,1.0633,6.0826,0.1934,2.1649,2.1619,4.2566,5.31,6.87,1.2558,6.3111,2.6377,1.7533,4.4327,2.8508,1.5326,4.988,3.934,1.9336,1.968,1.3576,5.5483,1.3805,1.4988,0.4386,3.4477,2.3812,1.6232,4.4415,4.6483,4.1791,3.4001,1.962,0.0612,2.3343,1.0988,2.0855,2.2277,1.245,0.0995,2.1583,0.5379,6.0692,4.3528,5.3441,2.6276,1.8637,1.4115,3.1481,4.4678,3.7112,1.671,0.1514,0.1909,0.6423,1.6778,5.8757,5.4657,3.5124,2.4615,5.3838,0.9827,2.2497,0.4045,4.6765,0.5658,4.7766,3.8725,5.1281,1.8622,4.3079,0.7701,5.3692,0.846,1.3755,4.3231,0.0637,4.221,0.0129,4.365,4.1906,5.5578,1.2851,3.4153,1.5207,1.2312,1.7609,6.0175,5.2131,1.7913,1.9013,1.4181,5.6251,3.9467,1.504,0.5318,2.1149,4.5876,4.4566,1.1585,2.4487,3.8331,2.8683,2.0141,1.6244,1.5478,1.7407,5.7692,1.6824,3.0553,5.6602,1.1335,1.4248,2.6824,1.5286,3.7629,3.1947,6.4389,5.4302,2.5717,4.4299,1.1876,0.3723,2.3301,0.3184,1.9144,2.4292,3.3501,1.8711,4.9432,1.5814,2.8885,3.1894,6.1401,1.1515,5.6606,0.1975,5.1007,3.2194,3.0576,0.1022,0.7664,4.4161,1.9452,5.7554,5.3903,2.1902,3.0984,2.5314,2.3419,0.9049,5.0469,6.0368,5.7247,4.4578,3.2674,0.0168,0.1425,4.9362,1.1415,0.0284,3.1229,2.9464,0.0047,3.5367,1.9146,5.1828,4.9547,2.2415,1.663,0.3577,0.8613,1.3471,5.1824,2.2572,4.1023,1.5904,2.1375,5.4266,0.6717,0.6416,2.1724,1.9069,0.9432,6.126,4.0402,0.9896,2.3422,0.5818,1.7846,5.022,5.6938,0.5885,4.407,1.0868,2.5571,5.5091,0.0848,0.1595,0.99,2.3709,0.0007,4.6837,3.1747,0.5817,2.343,3.7491,2.0482,6.7113,5.2499,4.7493,4.7535,3.3311,0.9921,4.3142,3.3144,0.0815,3.7801,5.6071,0.5182,0.3619,2.1501,2.9838,3.525,1.8649,6.029,5.0895,2.3812,1.0305,1.1682,1.1899,2.1569,2.806,2.2544,0.5322,4.9751,0.8255,0.9867,2.6754,3.1557,4.3023,0.001,2.1746,4.8934,0.6423,0.9059,4.4996,0.0363,0.0089,0.0009,0.0001,0.689,6.3392,0.8457,0.9333,0.7659,0.2689,1.8747,1.179,0.786,2.0687,4.7679,1.1903,0.9384,0.8776,1.2996,1.6671,1.0534,1.1115,2.2101,0.6665,0.5238,2.194,5.0433,1.6437,1.6395,3.263,1.7027,0.5066,1.3764,1.296,5.3441,2.5988,4.6833,3.377,0.4519,0.5237,5.1561,4.0431,3.0398,1.0787,0.8665,6.6369,2.3031,5.0756,2.6923,0.3931,3.8657,0.5973,0.2796]}
{"id":4309,"ended":false,"length":660,"gen_text":"Gauthier's 737 rig \u2014 which required 400 U.S. gallons ( 1 @, @ 500 L ) of hydraulic fluid to construct \u2014 was designed to move across multiple axes in order to better match the rig's size in the real world.\n\nThe team of engineers worked closely with industry experts and engineers to develop a rig that was perfect for the rig. The first stage included building a prototype of the rig using an array of advanced features that make it better suited for the rig's size. The rig also features three-axis sensors that help measure gas flow and temperature. This data-gathering method is called \"geo-zapper,\" and it will use data from more than 200 sensors including 3D-ray spectrometers and magnetometers to determine the composition of fluid the rig will be immersed in or on.\n\nWith this data, more precisely calculated fluid flow will be obtained, which makes it easier to determine the rig's natural size, said the team, who are led by Jason Smith, Senior Fellow, Hydrology and Energy Management at the Center for Innovative Science at Cornell University.\n\nAs a part of the lab's engineering design phase, the rig is designed so that it can move across hundreds of axes, moving up and down in a fluid-space. That fluid-space moves the rig to one side, and moving the other side will move it into the other way.\n\nFinally, the prototype rig features dual-axis sensors that measure wind speed, wind direction and the flow of the wind at different altitudes. When a wind is high as high as 5 mph, that direction will affect the flow of the rig, which will result in less turbulence and fuel efficiency, Smith said.\n\nThe company has tested the system on a variety of test rigs in the lab, with an array of different configurations, such as a 3-D-ray system that measures wind speeds along the top of an aircraft's nose. At different speeds, the turbines can vibrate, meaning that air molecules don't get trapped.\n\nAs the company progresses its engineering process, Smith said, more tests will be required using similar systems. If the rig, which uses an array of sensors and two 2-D cameras to determine air pressure, is used in a larger scale, they will include more tests, he said.\n\n\"This new rig uses the same physics principles and can be used for different lab applications,\" said Andrew Johnson, executive vice president and chief technical architect, Hydrology and Energy Management at Hydration. \"It's going to be an extremely demanding application for some of these high level engineering projects to be used in the lab.\"\n\nThe lab's engineering director, Michael Hsu, has more than 30 years of experience in the oil and gas industry. He said he is aware of the difficulties associated with the rig \u2014 there was much speculation in the early parts of the year about how the project was going to go \u2014 but he is confident the team will be able to deliver a rig that will meet the rig's needs.\n\n\"The test rig is very, very high quality, because it is actually built as an integrated array of different components, with a central central control unit that uses various mechanical systems,\" explained Hsu. \"At the scale of it and the size and configuration, it's very, very complex to develop. Because it's a large project, it can be difficult for a small team to build a rig that's only about 60 inches wide or so.\"","token_len":713,"entropy":[11.4485,6.3921,2.6778,12.4006,11.8915,5.5483,1.9043,6.8371,7.418,6.8917,0.1028,0.0021,0.0312,1.1396,5.4946,9.4566,10.7189,7.1311,6.1002,6.2579,5.2504,2.1281,0.3171,6.434,0.4653,1.2914,7.4157,1.0471,1.57,4.8186,0.7644,5.0599,5.5361,5.8306,6.926,2.8577,3.2797,0.0194,6.567,4.5503,0.836,2.1676,0.1005,4.1683,5.1209,1.8309,2.8063,0.0799,0.2055,0.761,0.0007,1.919,4.6852,2.9255,1.1626,4.3203,2.8765,0.0753,6.3558,1.4257,2.3941,3.2357,1.543,2.0858,1.1507,3.8566,0.3909,2.7503,5.5258,0.132,1.6512,1.7421,1.6521,1.7569,4.4391,4.157,3.9942,3.7773,0.8543,4.3959,1.9963,0.4336,1.3063,2.7203,3.2277,4.2656,0.0252,5.0024,4.2723,2.5988,4.4559,0.4528,5.5328,0.638,0.9029,1.5514,0.7714,0.467,2.789,1.0873,1.7296,2.1822,2.4534,4.8131,4.438,2.6364,1.5886,3.0425,0.9921,3.8221,5.1052,5.4142,1.6096,1.3949,2.1478,1.2432,4.4915,4.6665,4.0942,1.8026,0.0094,4.0926,2.0091,4.0628,1.8664,5.5686,2.3148,0.6693,4.9176,3.5498,1.3257,0.9975,1.4555,3.5631,6.0474,2.5642,0.5364,4.8857,0.0159,3.2327,1.9061,4.4284,5.1917,0.4334,1.9223,3.4494,3.537,0.6526,0.6903,1.5735,4.9122,0.2564,0.7698,2.5832,1.1236,4.7143,0.1161,4.5383,5.7564,0.9883,1.9976,1.5055,4.9338,0.0427,6.0015,3.2497,0.3788,0.42,0.0002,4.836,1.8222,1.9175,0.6829,7.0148,6.0819,4.5892,3.1622,2.1866,3.4683,0.1259,4.075,1.4337,2.6437,5.4019,0.9209,1.5504,0.353,2.5673,1.0227,2.3346,0.0309,5.3154,2.6421,2.2763,3.1271,4.418,0.7963,2.2648,1.1167,1.8487,4.7065,0.0347,5.6275,5.3995,0.4615,6.0721,3.6874,2.0414,5.7086,1.8404,1.1396,3.1487,3.7877,0.4927,0.659,2.8694,0.0185,5.7113,0.012,3.538,0.7993,3.8935,0.1154,0.3867,0.4213,0.0002,4.7693,1.9229,4.0576,0.0014,0.6694,5.6848,0.3155,4.9924,3.7316,4.4674,0.0612,0.5467,3.3348,2.7114,2.4396,3.8197,0.3558,1.1087,1.2348,2.4013,2.3912,4.9868,0.0256,3.0809,1.7304,4.941,2.8303,0.79,0.0167,2.9501,1.5504,4.8301,1.5093,5.9107,3.3946,4.6377,2.1298,0.9992,0.0799,4.5566,2.5038,0.6224,3.0013,4.6431,0.9938,1.2756,1.7703,4.7846,1.6116,1.4441,0.4793,3.5627,1.2385,0.9794,4.0556,1.6066,1.5279,7.4395,0.3454,1.1122,0.0002,5.8983,0.0286,0.5992,6.3864,0.978,4.0732,6.3697,1.0039,0.5524,0.9751,0.7296,1.1424,4.5732,1.0082,0.6544,2.7774,1.0861,0.947,3.266,2.868,0.7564,3.1335,2.8833,3.8293,1.339,3.6948,0.0,0.3984,4.4082,2.9053,1.0868,1.3751,2.9484,7.4572,2.9336,0.0146,4.1226,1.4619,0.5963,4.9554,5.6697,1.8505,4.4061,0.3768,1.7056,0.1837,0.685,0.7714,1.6768,1.5203,1.0823,4.3981,0.0031,3.9079,4.1553,1.3612,6.039,3.5357,1.8392,2.3128,0.1856,0.0372,0.341,0.0001,1.3273,5.0379,2.8218,4.246,0.9527,3.3302,1.4188,2.0454,1.8485,0.0021,4.0132,0.4099,2.6758,1.2643,1.8426,0.9684,3.6731,4.4844,3.5688,0.0129,3.007,3.1155,1.8871,3.0874,0.005,1.4939,4.313,1.2366,1.0192,0.6395,0.2445,4.0378,1.2205,1.9521,1.2409,2.1144,5.0092,1.0685,4.6327,0.6224,3.0667,3.1895,1.8145,2.0882,1.9109,5.4508,3.9756,2.0147,0.3938,0.6114,5.7424,2.3071,5.0712,0.0004,1.7962,5.2181,0.9828,5.3902,3.4922,5.2968,0.0009,3.4688,2.1923,3.4084,0.6731,0.0002,4.2526,1.0431,4.4594,3.6556,3.6127,2.1383,1.7474,0.1453,1.6282,0.2176,0.6404,3.4434,3.3774,0.6744,0.2364,2.4717,6.6332,4.3931,1.9516,1.606,5.0665,0.9625,0.9713,6.2305,1.2571,3.077,2.637,1.3688,0.0157,1.679,2.1152,3.7155,3.9797,0.6367,0.4643,3.725,1.7068,3.5847,4.1812,1.4381,0.6901,1.5788,4.708,1.3833,1.3412,3.9597,2.2996,0.6713,3.8856,1.2999,5.0211,1.648,4.5407,1.647,0.9454,0.1578,0.033,0.1856,0.0002,1.5467,2.5112,4.4287,0.652,4.6343,2.0747,0.5801,5.3017,5.2903,2.5157,4.4596,1.1999,1.1273,2.182,2.9835,5.9941,2.1534,0.5657,2.8441,5.6807,5.5874,0.0342,5.7362,0.532,0.0084,1.6619,1.3178,2.9848,6.2723,2.0827,2.1746,0.4139,0.2107,0.023,0.008,0.2623,4.1582,3.9237,1.8289,0.527,1.9625,0.8294,2.964,0.012,0.6212,2.9006,2.5008,4.9918,3.9097,1.8287,4.9757,0.7427,2.2845,4.5007,6.0396,3.0416,2.0022,4.6741,2.3026,3.6284,1.0176,1.9878,1.3068,0.383,0.1287,0.0002,1.4375,4.6292,1.5999,3.8724,4.7004,0.2976,4.0607,4.6089,5.189,0.177,3.6929,5.5477,0.6079,1.7247,0.0551,0.2348,0.128,0.6285,1.2904,3.0851,0.2648,0.0567,0.3602,1.3567,0.6607,2.2138,2.262,2.1171,4.3319,0.1591,0.9083,5.4775,2.9398,0.0144,2.1206,1.4429,4.926,5.0273,4.0795,5.884,3.1833,3.3981,0.7302,3.0267,6.0744,0.0025,0.2569,3.1789,0.9307,2.2898,1.1504,3.6246,2.9817,0.2834,0.0469,1.9807,1.7058,0.2727,0.9738,2.1314,0.9111,1.198,2.4273,1.2166,1.0144,0.289,0.0086,3.4039,2.5451,0.8387,0.3777,2.1223,1.939,0.8729,0.3811,0.0292,1.1061,0.6035,0.139,0.0002,0.6249,2.1317,5.1012,0.5675,1.1297,3.1418,3.1196,0.0019,4.171,1.8587,1.3414,5.4473,1.0704,1.8755,5.2743,3.2408,4.4669,2.1802,3.5675,5.5039,0.9689,3.7464,2.5068,1.7404,3.3046,1.9571,5.3311,5.239,2.2994,3.3768,1.5868,5.1467,4.9939,5.7901,3.0158,1.5371,7.0187,0.3103,0.0003,0.6394,0.2497,5.1716,0.9161,6.6828,0.8787,4.0841,3.8297,0.8049,2.8558,2.3402,4.1909,2.2592,1.0626,1.251,2.2172,1.6077,0.0053,3.4217,2.5254,3.8831,2.135,5.5181,1.6561,0.7524,1.8699,3.2287,3.8855,0.3456,1.2794,3.5272,1.0827,3.6459,2.1783,2.3783,2.4985,1.1482,0.2363,3.284,1.8817,0.9314,0.6592,2.1043,5.2669,2.8242,4.3345,3.9094,2.4826,2.8003,1.8005,0.8402]}
{"id":3138,"ended":false,"length":627,"gen_text":"Grasshoppers exemplify a range of anti @ - @ predator adaptations, enabling them to avoid detection, to escape if detected, and in some cases to avoid being eaten if captured. Grasshoppers are usually carnivores that are found growing in small or small amounts. They feed primarily on grasshoppers and grasshoppers are also carnivores that are found growing in large quantities. Grasshoppers typically inhabit the margins of ecosystems such as deserts, forests and mountains. They are also present in larger herbivores.\n\nIt is important to note that Grasshoppers are not omnivores. Grasshoppers feed mostly on grasshoppers. The grasshoppers use their digestive organs to digest the food and have a very high energy for their body needs. Their meat is not eaten by insects or livestock, which is why they do not kill themselves. Grasshoppers can tolerate a variety of soil and vegetation forms like tree bales and are very adaptable to any environment. Also it is important to note that they do not have to go through a stressful environment to survive, such as a high school environment. They have limited body needs because they live alone.\n\nIt is important to note that Grasshoppers have a set of evolved body shapes. These are known from many species of insect (Ebola, the nematode E. coli, the cetacean Staphylococcus aureus) as well as from other animals. They can have brown coloring on their legs, eyes, chest and the chest cavity (the upper part of the body that covers the head, mouth and feet), and even on their face like many other herbivores. It is important to note that it is necessary to understand that these can contain a bunch of different colorations and their colors are not the same color as other types of plants, such as in the case of grasshoppers.\n\nIn most species, where an insect has a red-orange or cyan under the abdomen, the color will match the color of the individual body parts (see below).\n\nMost commonly, the color of the abdomen is orange or green. Other commonly known colorations include, purple, magenta, orange and yellow (e.g., brown, reddish, brown or green). However, they do not always match, and sometimes have shades of orange or magenta.\n\nEidoms can have a number of different colorations. For example, some species will have white under the abdomen (sometimes called yellow over the abdomen). However, black under the abdomen will not match the green or white of a flower or leaf. The body colors of the winged insects that have yellow wings will always match the color of the flower, wing or flower. Some insects that have black wings will not have the same body colors as green, or yellow, or other types of colors.\n\nIn some species, the color of the winged insects that have dark markings also does not match the color of the individual body parts and will always match the body shape. Other insects that have bright markings, such as moths or cockroaches will not look like the individual body parts of the individual body parts (including abdomen).\n\nA grasshopper's mouth is not

{"id":544,"ended":false,"length":661,"gen_text":"Early on April 30 a special train from Fort Macleod arrived with police officers and doctors. Premier Frederick Haultain arrived at the disaster site on May 1, where he met with engineers who had been carrying out the design for the new bridge.[4] During the visit, he toured parts of the site and learned about the problems facing those designing the new bridge to accommodate the new structure.[5] The building's structural design has been changed over the four years of its construction so that its interior looks more modern. The building is being built on 10th century brick, and is expected to add 6,000 square feet to its final footprint. The reconstruction effort will feature many changes, including additions of exterior and interior walls, addition of a new central gate into the top of the bridge, and improvements in an existing stone porthole. The new bridge, which is being built in the same style as the original, will use less paint and have a more rounded facade.[6] The bridge is expected to be completed in 2017, and there are a number of local business owners who have called for some form of restoration.[7][8][9] A bridge in this style is considered a major development for the region, and one that can enhance the safety of future generations.\n\nThe new bridge will bring a new level of confidence to the area's bridges: The new bridge is expected to feature many new amenities including water crossings, a light rail, a new public street, an observation lounge designed to increase traffic flow on both the north and east sides of the bridge, a new public plaza, improved pedestrian walkway that will extend onto the main street and will offer a complete public plaza, as well as an indoor pool and garden, and a new air conditioning unit for visitors on site.\n\nHistory\n\nThe original Fort Macleod bridge, which was constructed in 1855 on private land located near a railroad junction, was constructed by the Army's Corps of Engineers to serve as the bridge terminus between Fort Macleod. The site was purchased in 1852, and with the completion of the project, it was opened for urban use. The facility was used by residents, schoolboys and other children at night.\n\nOn March 23, 1856, a grand jury was convened to examine Fort Macleod's construction, and its possible impact on its historic character.[10] On April 28, President Jefferson had visited Fort Macleod, where the U.S. Embassy had just returned from a stay aboard the first of its kind in Fort Macleod. This was held in order to assist a family of workers in the construction of the new bridge. By October 1st they were on hand after the U.S. Embassy had brought the families down to Fort Macleod to prepare for their departure.[11]\n\nDuring the final stages of the project, the building was replaced by new \"Boat Terminal'', a modernization that would also address Fort Macleod's accessibility, comfort, and safety in a way no new bridge before in the region had been able to do.[12]\n\nNotes\n\n\u2191 The \"Architecture of Port Saint-Henriis\" in the Fort Macleod Historical Library is listed here \u2191 In addition to drawing attention to the new structure and the building's significance, the work by architect Robert O'Neill and two local contractors, Artistic Director Michael Wark, will also help facilitate the creation of a map of downtown as part of the

{"id":579,"ended":true,"length":655,"gen_text":"After the publication of his book on the fur trade, Innis turned to a study of an earlier staple \u2014 the cod fished for centuries off the eastern coasts of North America, especially Florida and North Dakota. He found that the cod was much older than we assumed, and that cod harvests were growing at an accelerating rate.\n\nWhile the cod fished off the eastern coast of America might once have been part of the original fish stock, they were no longer. As far as the early history of the fish, the cod is still widely used as a food source for fish, and is now mostly used as a staple along the western coast of the United States, including most of North America.\n\nIt's time for Innis to go back with a deeper look at what happened to our ancestors long before we arrived. As a scientist, I can't be the only one calling for more investigation into the deep past of marine life and its descendants.\n\nFor the first time, we're looking at the early development of a new type of fish. Just like the cod fished for centuries off the western coast of the United States, cod harvests and harvests for many of the same fish were not recorded until after the American Revolution.\n\nThe most recent discovery of a fish in North America came after the 19th century, which was the first great change in fishing behavior in human history, said Dan Linnen, a cod researcher at the Natural History Museum in Philadelphia who led the team that discovered the cod in 1989.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the cod was catching more and more fish, and it became less popular for its own good, said Linnen. That changed in the early 1990s, after Congress passed laws expanding the use of fishing at the Great Lakes, which were in the process of being gutted as a result of the Great Depression. The cod's popularity peaked before the Great Recession of 2009, when the Great Fish & Wildlife Fund, a federally funded grant organization, finally gave fish food aid after it was put to good use during that recession.\n\nBy the end of 2015, about one-third of all Great Lakes fish were already being caught. Today, the Great Gulf cod is growing so fast that it has reached 15,000 tons per year, said Linnen. He notes one notable exception to this trend stems from the U.S.'s southernmost coast, which is home to more than 90 percent of the world's fish. As a result, cod harvesters are catching more fish than ever, Linnen said. Many of the fish used earlier in our history were found on that coast, and so far, fishing is mostly done at the southernmost point of the Great Lakes.\n\nAs these fish become more abundant, so will the demand for them, Linnen said: \"It's becoming obvious that these cod are more valuable than they were five hundred years ago. At this time, there are a lot of new fish growing in the Gulf of Mexico, and there will be more in the U.S. in the coming years.\"\n\nYou can follow @charlotte_sharon on Twitter or catch up with her on Facebook.

{"id":1382,"ended":true,"length":677,"gen_text":"Project Chanology began its campaign by organizing and delivering a series of denial @ - @ of @ - @ service attacks against Scientology websites and flooding Scientology centers with prank calls and black faxes, posting them online, using the #Dissect Scientology hashtags and other ways to provoke confusion.\n\nIn response, the group attempted to organize the \"anti-Scientology\" propaganda line: \"This is not about Scientology,\" according to the original poster. This was later changed after the site's administrators received a public report saying they were taking down comments from the site stating \"Scientology has been taking pictures and videos of itself, and being linked to other websites with fake or false posts. To this day, I am never able to find any way to verify the authenticity of these messages. This will be an online effort.\"\n\nWhen asked what \"false postings\" meant to the group and what \"the purpose\" was, an account holder for the campaign noted the following, \"You probably never heard of them. They just hate Scientology. They are bigoted scoundrels, so you know the Scientology world.\"\n\nThey followed up by publishing a series of blogs and Twitter messages on the subject of Scientology's \"infiltration\" of Scientology, with messages from some members suggesting they had given up living overseas where they might serve the religion's \"enemies.\"\n\nOne posted, titled \"#Dissect Scientology is the evil religion where you just watch the sun go down and your friends don't know it,\" noted the blog's author as saying, \"When a good Scientologist is living like nothing you just watch the sun go down like nothing will ever happen again. It's like the bad world that you are living, then you can't go see any other good people.\"\n\nAnother said \"We believe that there is a better way of thinking about the true nature of Scientology than to live a life with the words #Dissect Scientology. It will be hard for them to escape this because everyone will say #Dissect Scientology is just a publicity ploy. They can never even say #Dissect Scientology is an evil religion. Most of them are good people.\"\n\nThe site was set up to promote its mission and the #Dissect Scientology campaign, and was soon being promoted by Scientology's official Twitter account, which was quickly deleted. The fake news site was shut down by one of its administrators.\n\nIn response, the group tweeted on Monday that it will not continue its campaign and is trying to establish more organizations \"to organize protests. Scientology is not welcome, so you have to take down any Scientology site this month to oppose that.\"\n\nAs part of their effort they were also reportedly \"encouraged by @LASO\" Twitter account to contact supporters of the two political opponents, suggesting they can coordinate a social media campaign.\n\nOther organizations they were linked with included groups for \"Social Justice Warriors,\" including a group of non-violent protesters led by a local political activist, and a group for LGBT activists, in association with the ACLU.\n\nIn one online tweet, he wrote that \"the @LASO organization called on to stand up & fight for @freedomofspeech\" called members of the #LASO group \"sons of devils of God.\" Some on the group's web site were already using #LASO's hashtag to protest the project.\n\n\"I am a former Scientologist. This #Dissect Scientology campaign is a good step on my way to be an official supporter of the Free Speech Movement,\" he

{"id":4075,"ended":false,"length":661,"gen_text":"In August 1974 Bundy received a second acceptance from the University of Utah Law School and moved to Salt Lake City, leaving Kloepfer in Seattle. While he called Kloepfer often, he dated and played with Kloepfer almost daily until the mid-'70s\n\nWhile he did have frequent encounters with Kloepfer and Kloepfer-era employees, Bundy never said goodbye to them until 1988 when he quit.\n\nHe was once quoted as saying after speaking with Bundy's children before he left that he wished they had never met him.\n\nIn 1994, Bundy filed a federal complaint for defamation against him for saying that he knew from 1987 that he had been shot by members of the Klay community but had killed himself by \"inadvertently shooting\" the cattle at a ranch in West Virginia. He also asked what \"inadvertently\" meant in the past month he had shot some cows but had killed them after a \"dishonest\" farmer who got caught with what he called \"a bunch of [heavily armed] men... [had some illegal firearms] \".\n\nWhile Bundy held public office for seven months in 1993 and 1994, he was not involved in any organized political activism, and had never publicly supported civil rights (including free speech) laws (which were unconstitutional).\n\nIn 1998, he was also arrested (having been under the influence of methamphetamine when he was 13), and spent 15 years in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Department where the FBI had previously arrested two former federal employees.\n\nIn 1994, he became an outspoken advocate against child pornography and to support \"The Family and Children\" in his anti-incidents program. His office then received numerous death threats, and his death threat after he was elected governor of Utah in 1987 is the subject of the documentary 'The Life of An Illegal Slave', a highly publicized film which chronicles an extremely disturbing time in Bundy's life.\n\nIn 2003, Kloepfer was named interim speaker at the University of Utah, and he was elected President last November.\n\nHis final statements\n\nDuring the course of his term, Kloepfer had one last message for me:\n\nThere is no greater good than having a family.\n\nThis has been part of my life since I was 19. The day I left my home in the summer of 1973 for a job I loved just a little bit better than I did growing up. I thought my job would be fun and relaxing. I knew I would be working, working hard. I would enjoy doing it for a while. But that's when it got out... I started to see that there was really something wrong about this, and it got so bad that my only hope was to move on with all of my good jobs. I knew there would be a lot of work, and it was never going to look good. A few years ago, I did a podcast called \"Laugh It Out,\" where I gave a talk about what really matters to the American people \u2013 kids, families and government, but also the issues around marriage and families... for my next five years, I kept reminding myself how great it would be for America if I moved on to a different job. The government has always been a huge help to us, and I always felt like it was important to get to know people. It was a good time to be alive in my new life, I am so thankful to the government. I know I'm not going anywhere again.\n\nRelated

{"id":261,"ended":true,"length":615,"gen_text":"Galveston is the home of several of the largest teaching hospitals in the state, located on the campus of the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Prior to Hurricane Ike, the Galveston campus was in extreme drought since early winter, and the evacuation order was issued because of flooding and heavy weather from Hurricane Harvey, although those orders were actually lifted a few minutes after the storm hit. The evacuation order is based on data from the Texas Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.\n\nThe state government is providing shelter and medical supplies to all residents at the Galveston campus.\n\nGelatin City has been closed to the public for nearly three weeks.\n\nGalveston University recently announced that it will be donating a portion of its operating expenses to the state through an online partnership with the Galveston Economic Development Office.\n\nA total of 10 school districts in Galveston received disaster aid in February. The school district's largest, the Corpus Christi Valley High School District, received $5.5 million and the Corpus Christi Valley High School District's largest, Corpus Christi Community College District, received nearly $1 million in funds. A total of four schools in Corpus Christi received disaster relief.\n\nStudents from Galveston were evacuated from schools where they were going to live after the storm, including the university's public safety office, the district's Disaster Response Support Center, and the school's hospital emergency room.\n\nThe school is home to the national Christian Fellowship for Disaster Relief and Emergency Preparedness. The university is also hosting the New Christian Relief Conference. The event will continue for a minimum of 24 hours.\n\nGalveston Chancellor Michael Dye, who has been the chancellor of Galveston University since 2005, announced this morning that he will be re-nominating his faculty at the university.\n\n\"Our focus this fall is on increasing Galveston's mission to meet growing challenges of the day for the Greater Galveston economies,'' Dye stated in a news release. \"I am pleased to announce that I am leaving my current position as chancellor of Galveston University; and, in addition to supporting the Galveston community, I am eager to support the greater Galveston economy by helping foster greater innovation and growth in our community.\"\n\nUniversity President John F. Kowalski announced Tuesday afternoon that University President Scott Eisner will join Kowalski's temporary faculty appointment.\n\n\"I am excited to take up this position at the University of Texas and, as president, I would like to work closely with Gov. Kowalski and the Governor's Office of Public Safety on preparing us for and addressing extreme weather,\" said Kowalski. \"I look forward to my discussions with all of you, fellow students, faculty and staff on how to improve Galveston's state policy environment, which I believe is essential to the success of this university.''\n\nFor further news, visit:

{"id":1652,"ended":false,"length":678,"gen_text":"On August 14, 1862, Pitman left school without his family's knowledge and volunteered to serve in the Union Army and fight in the American Civil War. He apparently never informed his family nor any one that he participated in the action.[4] During the Civil War he was shot in the hip and died on top of his horse.[5] Pitman's story is not new as he could not attend school with his family after graduation. According to his father, his father and other friends were also not well informed about the actions of he and his family at the time. His father has repeatedly claimed that he was fired after being informed that he knew nothing of the Civil War. Pitman had received a B.S. in Economics from University of Pittsburgh, with a 4.5 grade point average for his reading and mathematics. He also participated in more than 80 field battles including his most recent victory at the battle of Chattanooga (July 12, 1862).[6]\n\nPitman suffered from tuberculosis and mental illness, and later became a member of the Black Guard who participated in the American Indian Protection System (ABPS), a military training program for veterans. His father and many other friends were not as informed as they were about the service of the American Indian Guard when he volunteered to serve.[7] The story of Pitman continues. When he was 5 he returned home from school with only a letter from his father informing him that 'the United States was the enemy.' As a result of the letter, several members of his family remained in the Civil War due to that incident as they had never thought of that day. The Army did not publicly list Pitman and he died in 1862 without having received any further notification either, and as a result of the war, he remained a veteran.\n\nPitman did receive information about a man named Joseph P. Sacks who participated in the Black Freedom Riders National Militia, where he gave them military training. However, the NOLAF was not a national militia organization; it was only an armed organization for the purpose of fighting the Confederates.[8]\n\nPitman could be seen in the Army's B,W,W,M and O class during the Civil War and many of the O and L Class did not. The only surviving members of this service were soldiers serving on the 19th Marine Division.[9] Pitman's family became aware of his actions at his age and asked the military for his return but their request ended with his death on February 24, 1865. As a result of his death, many individuals in the Army who served in the War in France felt that Pitman must have been part of one of the most significant Civil War veterans of all time, to whom the Army might need to send more soldiers to the war. Pitman's legacy lives on as well.[10]\n\nPitman and his family continue to be active members of the National Civil War Veterans Association. Their membership does not include any other veterans of the War.[11] This organization is officially called the National National Veterans Association, Inc.[12]\n\nPitman is survived by his wife, Mary Sills, two boys (one of whom died in the war), his daughter, Emily, brother, Philip R. Jr., son, William R.

{"id":4878,"ended":false,"length":666,"gen_text":"He completed a move to Football League Two side Exeter City in summer 2008, signing for the first time for a club in the Football League. He made his first team debut in 2008\/09 for Bournemouth and played just six minutes in the 3-0 defeat to Manchester United with a hamstring injury. Afterwards, he moved to Chelsea for the 2007\/08 season, playing one regular season game under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and helping West Ham avoid four defeats in total before his arrival at Upton Park in early August 2009.\n\nAt age 10, Adebayor appeared on UEFA's Youth World Cup team for Portugal, winning the Gold Cup. On the bench, he led his country to victory and Euro 2012 victory over France for the final score of the Euro with a 4-0 win over Spain in their victory over Real Madrid. As a full-back, he played the majority of the game as a substitute but also played in four times as a substitute for Real, scoring two goals.\n\nIn 2012, Adebayor was named as the UEFA Youth Player of the Year by his nation for his work with the Club. He was named in the UEFA Youth Player of the Year for his work on international training, competition and matches.\n\nAdebayor is very popular with football fans overseas where they want to watch him in action. The midfielder believes he can play alongside many great defenders including Gareth Bale, Frank Lampard and Yaya Toure as well as provide players with the game's physical attributes which are often overlooked by English football.\n\nIn the game against Denmark, Adebayor had an excellent defensive performance and has shown his value in the game as an option at centre back. His defensive displays have also been rewarded with awards from UEFA, and are now in the \"Best in Europe at the World Cup\" award from their awards committee which was recognised alongside the best player on the team, in an extremely exciting tournament. At this World Cup, the World Cup of Ultimate Fighting Championship, he was named as the \"Most Valuable European player with the World Player of the Year\" by the European Association of Sport (EAS) Committee, with Team of the Year from the World Under-21 Championships being decided.\n\nAdebayor's play during the game has been featured in a video on UEFA. He said, The fact that he had one goal in 3-0 win over Denmark gave his team a real chance to win the game over their opponents and to win the tournament over the hosts. \"If we could score with 10,000, 11,000, 12,000 points in the game, that would definitely qualify. We have scored in the top three after winning 3-0, with the other two goals being scored by me. The two goals were just for a couple minutes, when I used my hands there was no time to sit and wait for the score to come,\" he said.\n\n\"I did not want the team to think that we were going to win in a way so they sent the ball out. They thought that I would use my hands against them because their hands move in the air and touch my feet, which is a good thing.

{"id":4550,"ended":false,"length":667,"gen_text":"The opening track `` No Banker Left Behind `` references the financial bailout of 2007 and criticizes bankers and government. Alec Wilkinson of The New Yorker writes that the song `` ridicules the considerations of 'the law that makes the law.'\"\n\n\nIt goes on to cite Robert S. McCrae, ''I'm the Law That Says the Banker Can't Pay Back His Government Debts,'' and ''Banks Are No Longer Safe.\" Wilkinson also notes that the song ends with the following quote.\n\nIt is a very good, good song. It is not a song for anyone concerned that the law might be taken away. The government can't pay back its debts. To the extent that I am aware I have said it, I've done it with a view to making things better for our country. I do not know what a law that has been in place has allowed our military to survive.\n\nThe song is, of course, quite different from what it used to be about. In its previous, less-policing and more-commercial form, Wilkinson quotes some of the key terms of the ''Banks Can't Pay Back Their Government Debts'' song. It goes on to quote one of McCrearies's most famous quotes from that album. From it, McCrae quotes the following quote.\n\nI like banks. I like them because they don't get arrested. They do not get forced to do anything. If I don't give them a bribe, I don't take them into custody. At law-abiding banks that are willing to help, I don't ask. What gets done to them will only be done through the law.\n\nIt is not a song, then, for the public to read. In fact, McCrae refers to the song as simply the song that McReagh used to get him in jail. McReagh didn't do it in any particular way. He merely used it to illustrate the fact that the government will not pay back its debts.\n\nWhile this quote may seem like a personal favor given that he is an Army colonel, it makes an important point. During his service in Iraq he did use this song. McCrae made note of it several times and was very open about it during his interview on ABC News, but it was never used by him. When he is in court, however, he should be sure that the government has a good understanding that we will not pay their debts and that we will not pay them back.\n\nThe problem is that this, of course, is the only time that people who are actually aware that they were paid by banks have actually heard this song on radio. It is so widely circulated, to the extent that it has already had the same effect on the public all over the globe that McCrae did.\n\nHowever, it is not clear that this \"Banks Can't Pay Back Their Government Debts\" song is the only song on that list. Of the five major songs on this new list, the main one by U.S. government officials has been \"No Banker Left Behind.\"\n\nMcReagh was originally a law professor at Yale Law School and was the first law professor to write about private corporate law.

{"id":462,"ended":true,"length":630,"gen_text":"Six months after the quake as much as 98 percent of the rubble remained uncleared. An estimated 26 million cubic yards ( 20 million cubic meters ) remained, making most of the capital city the largest city in northeastern Congo. The government says that only 6 percent of the city contains sufficient safe and habitable material for construction.\n\nThe UNRWA-registered Rokbe, a country of 14 million people near the mouth of the river Kigali, fell victim to widespread and deadly bushfires.\n\nIt is a disaster zone, with most of the capital and other northern provinces under intense threat, said Thomas Segal, deputy director of the UNRWA.\n\n\"I don't know if there are any survivors at all,\" he said, with survivors including the youngest of seven children. \"They are not getting food, water, clean clothes, shelter, clothing, water, medicine, medicines with little water.\"\n\nAt least 32 schools were damaged, and a village suffered massive damage. As of December there were more than 4,000 casualties, but only 10 percent remained of the 11,400 reported in Rokbe alone.\n\nOfficials said that the disaster was caused by forest fires triggered by a lightning strike, which can quickly kill a tree if there isn't enough rainfall already in the region to keep the fire from moving further, which will then kill the rest of the forest.\n\nIn December 2004, four years after the war in eastern Congo killed 8.7 million Rwandans and 3.2 billion people, an earthquake ravaged that country as thousands of people perished -- a disaster even greater than the one in Congo-Burundi that killed 9.1 million in 1961. Rwanda, then a U.S.-supported African Union force, was forced largely to abandon its peace plan at Uygur, a large city southwest of Bangui.\n\nAccording to the National Earthquake Data Center, in January 2006, a magnitude 5.3 earthquake struck the center of Rokbe. The site was flattened and the city center was razed. In May, a total of 654,000 tons of food, firefighting supplies, medical equipment and other emergency supplies were forced into the city, where many thousands of health and medical staff were lost.\n\nIn 2006, UNRWA President Christiane Aman said there were just 1,500 people left in the country, and at least 1,000 of them suffered severe illnesses after suffering heavy rains and high winds.\n\nSome residents of Rokbe were evacuated and others who survived were held in isolation until a new government arrived this month to oversee the disaster.\n\nThe disaster drew widespread international condemnation on Sunday after two U.S.-based missionaries were killed and two Rwandan children injured in two attacks on Christian churches in March, a report said.\n\nThe two American missionaries were on their way north for \"the day of reconciliation,\" a UN official said. The official did not name whom the missionaries were involved in and insisted that it was not a church attack in the name of peace.\n\nThree more U.S.-supported missionaries also died in the attacks, one in April and another in April.\n\nA UNRWA spokesman denied the attack was related to peace talks with Rwanda, which has since agreed to halt the attacks and that the Congolese government is to work with the United Nations to end the violence.\n\n-- This report was updated at 5:58 am by Patrick Wilson on March 22, 2015\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 The Washington Times, LLC.

{"id":4339,"ended":false,"length":638,"gen_text":"As the rebel forces advanced towards his enemy's line, Alexios's flankers sprung their ambush. Their attack did indeed cause some initial confusion, but Bryennios ( or, according to the English speaker's point ), did not intend to kill him, only to injure his men in case he attempted to attack another village on top of him.\n\nBryennios' men charged through the city, but once they took up position, the fleeing Luians had been driven back and had thus left the rebels behind. Bryennios continued fighting, and at one stage managed to strike Alexios, taking his own life. The surviving fighters were unable to return from their mission, but were able to rescue their comrade Alexios on the spot.\u00a0\nYerdene's troops were able to hold on to the south flank of Luthuli, and Alexios was able to capture them, forcing the rebels to use force against them after a short battle. Bryennios fought and led the group up the mountain, where they found the rebels holding out the city.\n\nHowever, some of the other rebels remained in Luthuli, fighting for their lives, as their position on the plateau and their small village had been taken from them.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe Luin force arrived in the spring of 1787, and in the following years their position on the plateau was taken by the Lothians, who had been besieging the city without any weapons and despite the deathly fear of the Lothian attack. The two main rebels, Alexandros and Ivan, had lost all three of their men, but were able to force Bryennios and Ivan into alliance with Naxos, after allowing Bryennios to retreat under the orders of Alexander, and their forces had been able to advance on his troops.\n\nOnce Alexander conquered the province, the Luin returned to their former stronghold of Juglians. Alexander managed Alexander to make the eastern part of the empire a stronghold over which he could expand out south into the Black Sea region and finally extend it farther south into the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nAlexander managed to regain control of Juglians in the fall of 1790, and the Luin began raiding and trading the city of Palaeolithic resources with its nearby towns as part of his plan to get back at Luthuli. He had managed several raids on cities in the region and killed his wife, but the Luin soon moved on. They now possessed many of the villages in Juglians, such as the old, abandoned village of B\u00fcnter, which had previously been abandoned by Alexander's troops.\n\nAlexios, as always, would never accept a position as a Luin king for fear of being removed to a different political realm. But even Alexander could not shake the resentment that his own people felt towards him after he relinquished their hold atop his throne. A battle was fought on the outskirts of Juglians on that day, where Bryennios killed several Luin forces, in the midst of which he attacked the Luin.\n\nAlexander is perhaps best known as the founder of the Kingdom of Palaeolithic India, in northeastern parts of the Empire where Alexander is known as one of the \"Father of the New Kingdom.\" His last known address was in a speech by Alexander to

{"id":4210,"ended":false,"length":671,"gen_text":"After Nunn's death, the building passed through the hands of a few more owners and the station sold gasoline from various other companies. In the 1970s, Fina took over the building and opened its own home in the center of the development, which now has over 15,000 people. In 2003, the Nunn family was granted the right to rename the building their home, a move that could change the life of those who live within the community. [ 5 ] During Fina's tenure as CEO, the building underwent a renovation and now has over 3,500 workers and 1,000 apartments. [ 6 ] The building has been renamed to the Nunn Building in honor of the late Nunn, who would later become a legend in the area. [ 7 ] In the 1990s, an apartment complex was built at the Southside of the former building with apartments in the same style as the former building. The addition of a large outdoor swimming pool opened the doors to the complex and expanded the community. As part of the development, a new hotel has taken over the building, so some of the apartments have been renovated and new kitchens, gas stations and dining facilities have been added to give the space new personality. [ 8 ] At one time, building workers from Nunn held an event at the Southside where they participated in the creation of the building, which was named after the community. [ 9 ]\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nNunn was established by Nunn residents in 1864 as a settlement of business at Lake Shore in downtown Los Angeles. The building is still standing and has three distinct buildings. The first building to be redeveloped, and one that would become the Nunn Building, was the old building originally built by a community of Nunn residents and their descendants in 1888 by Joe Nelson, at the corner of West 17th Street and Sutter Boulevard in downtown Los Angeles. The building is now part of the East Village Historic District and houses the Nunn Hall of Fame (the first building dedicated thereto) and the Nunn Gardens. [ 10 ] The building was the site of the first Nunn Music Studio. Other buildings have served as reminders, reminders of the Nunn community and its culture.[ 11 ]\n\nIn 1965, a historic landmark was added to the building which has featured in a number of iconic Nunn landmarks such as the Plaza and Grand Plaza, and the South Side Museum. [ 12 ] The landmark has the same name as that of the downtown Los Angeles Nunn School district in 1963.\n\nThe Nunn Building was created by the community in 1967 to commemorate the people who worked to create the Nunn Neighborhood by merging Los Angeles and Central District business districts. It was designated for the school district by the Los Angeles City Council following the passage of a resolution on Aug. 1, 2002. (It also served as a location for the Nunn Plaza Hotel, which was constructed by the City of Los Angeles on April 6, 1975.)\n\nThe site of the Nunn building has a total area of 18,000 square feet by 2,000 square feet, but only 6% is of city-owned land, and the other 20% is donated to downtown Los Angeles Community Development. The site's most historic development has also provided the perfect location for Nunn Art and Art Spaces to display and sell.\n\nIn 1998, The Village Weekly published a story which showed the new Nunn Building in the \"Sydney's New Neighborhood\" by Mike Pfeifer on behalf of an art company (The Town of Nyatt).\n\nSee also [ edit

{"id":3582,"ended":false,"length":666,"gen_text":"In 2001 Stephen and Sylvia Czerkas compiled a traveling exhibit containing 34 other Chinese fossils. The show is titled Feathered Dinosaurs and the Origin of Flight. The San Diego Natural History Museum paid for the entire exhibit in its own way to enable scientists to bring the exhibit to a wider audience.\n\nCzerkas did also take a trip to the Smithsonian Institution to work with scientists on a project entitled The Origins of Flight. The two museums agreed to help organize the exhibit before it was released. The exhibit also features three dinosaurs, a bull and bear, and three bony limbs and three toes, and is called \"The Evolutionary Biology of Evolution.\" On the exhibit is a photo of one of the animals; one of the bony limbs has a \"pale\" brown or brown color, which is very uncommon in Asia.\n\nCzerkas also interviewed Bruce Lees, whose illustrations inspired her latest show. The two exhibitions are called \" The Bourgeois Artist and the Evolutionary Anthropologist.\" One of the exhibits, \" What We Found in Science,\" is a collection of prints made by paleontologists from the Late Cretaceous to the Present. The other exhibit, \" A Brief History of Paleontology,\" tells of dinosaurs and mammals, including the fossil-eating fish. Both exhibit include a photograph of a skull and the first bones, taken in the 1970s, are still being worked on today.\n\nThe \"Bourgeois Artist\" exhibit was open to anyone who had a budget of $10,000 or less. The two museums do offer a \"No Kid's Ticket\" promotion for those who had an extra $5 for a seat, and visitors can buy t-shirts, book bags and other items by offering them by calling 310-746-6273.\n\n\"We believe that at the beginning of the 20th century, we've had dinosaurs in all of our museums,\" says Barbara F. Shorter, curator of the museum's collection at Berkeley International Space Center. \"Because of the history of our dinosaur specimens and the conservation and conservation of dinosaur remains, we wanted to start taking that into consideration. We did have a short term, limited run that we had to go through before the museum opened.\"\n\nThe second exhibit was unveiled with open mic performances by curator and paleontologist Margaret Sayer. The show was presented at the museum's opening dinner in December. \"We saw ourselves as a museum of science, but we saw ourselves as an institution dedicated to science,\" Filler says of the museum. \"Our mission with this, and this show, was to teach the people about what dinosaurs are, what the evolutionary history of dinosaurs were like, what that dinosaur would be like if it were alive today. It was a challenge that only the scientists could solve. We all saw ourselves as a museum of science.\"\n\nOther exhibits include \" The Fossil Museum: New Research Directions for Science, by George E. Sommers,\" the latest collection of dinosaur skeleton studies from the U.S. National Science Foundation.\n\n\"The evolution of man is a natural process that has been accelerated by human-made changes in our environment and how we use resources and technology in our daily lives,\" says John Fink, a co-author of \" The Evolutionary Biology of Evolution.\" The fossil-eating animal was \"adapted for

{"id":2946,"ended":true,"length":656,"gen_text":"Wohlwend produced the art for Vlambeer's Ridiculous Fishing. The four @ - @ person team \u2014 Vlambeer designer Jan Willem Nijman and marketer Rami Ismail alongside iOS developer Zach Gage \u2014 was described by the Guardian as \"a brand-new level of fun and interesting.\"\n\nThe five judges will play a role in creating the art and design for the new-era RiffTrax platformer, which will launch on iOS and Android June 10. According to Ismail, his first game is the \"RiffTrax World Challenge\" and he wanted to put his art and company-focused game ideas in the new-era world. The game will have two endings: The one ending with the king and the one ending on a ship with seven characters.\n\n\"The one ending on a ship with eight is pretty exciting. I know what a game is like but I'm just really looking forward to trying out this new idea and trying to create ideas that really stand out, really. It's definitely something that I'm looking forward to doing.\"\n\nWillem Nijman, who created his game for RiffTrax, said, \"It's great to be part of a team that's spent some time building real life projects and trying to draw together from that.\" Ismail said he hopes the next game will be one of the most exciting creations he's made so far.\n\nIsmail then revealed that the game will focus on characters who are the main antagonists and each has his own unique personality and powers of action. It will feature two versions of a character with six powers, and each can fight with one of the five protagonists and will only be playable through the game.\n\nIt also comes after Apple, Facebook and Google announced a new version of iOS that includes access to the iPhone's GPS system, which allowed players to find each other in the real world in real time.\n\n\"I do think we're getting far ahead in how we make our iOS games for this new generation of consoles,\" Ismail said.\n\nWhile the new-era riffs are designed with minimal code, Hasselhoff will be using an existing design template used at the heart of the brand. \"There's absolutely something about how you can create your own world. This isn't just trying to do an original game, but it's doing something you've never done before and I think is really good at that for sure.\"\n\nA new look at the game will come with an open ended feature called \"Ships.\" Hasselhoff said she isn't sure who, exactly, is in the role but it's \"really interesting to be part of something like that... if it's something that we have really thought about for more than a year\" and will bring \"something like that to a mobile platform like iOS and we've actually done it.\"\n\nOther notable new-era riffs are: \"It's got a spaceship-themed concept that looks a lot like the game, it's got a ship and a guy who has control of it, in the same vein we were doing with our other game RiffTrax World Challenge.

{"id":1332,"ended":true,"length":669,"gen_text":"Retaliation had 700 visual effects shots, which were mostly handled by three effects companies. Visual effects supervisor Zachary < unk > declared that while the visuals aimed for the `` big and bold \"'', that they were done to achieve the best experience. The result was what was seen as a subtle shift from the traditional shots and still has the '-c' sound, but a slight drop in the intensity from the opening.\nWith this shift, Visual Effects produced some shots and images of the movie. The only feature on the main plot was where he looked at the map of Earth, and the movie was shot using the same location. This new location feature is set in the same time period and allows for better tracking between objects and different effects.\nThe next level was the use of a number of color correction algorithms. This took place on the screen and using the colors the audience saw, the shot was corrected. This also allowed for better use of color contrast from colors that were never used before. In other words, there was more work involved and the shots weren't really seen as being of the same level.\nWhile there were still some shots in this feature, and the color was very well toned out, there was one shot of the sunset in the film (in full color) where the camera was focusing to give the characters some clarity. The camera was so focused right at the start that it moved right out of the focus range, making it the best shot at seeing the planet we were talking about. The other shots were more in detail because of the more intense contrast. As the actors used that color contrast, the colors of the environment shifted, and it took less time for the actors to make the cuts, then for the CGI actors to take advantage of that transition, as they did from the beginning of the film to the end.\nThe 3D scene was done in 3x4x3 (as in an 8x8x8). The 3x3 shot was the most difficult shot I could make during the time. There was one major issue with this method, it took some time for any 3x2s to work. If you want, you could get the final one in 1x4x4 (which did work very well). This time I used an 8x6x6, which is also possible in this movie. When you get the 4x9x9 4x9 2x8 5x8, that's pretty much the only difference I really want to make over this movie. I'm sure there is a better, higher quality 3x4x3 that people can get to use.\nThe best bit about seeing a movie in 4x4x4 3x4x4 is how it brings down the final cost of a movie. We see all of these CGI shots when the movie is going on big enough to show off the final resolution, which in real life may never have been done. Also, they give the audience an idea that no matter how good a computer is, no new technology really can be made by doing this.\nI'm not making an exact point of this piece, but it will have to be read a lot, so if you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to use the comment box below. The final two movies are in 4x5x6.

{"id":1801,"ended":true,"length":656,"gen_text":"DuMont began with one basic disadvantage : unlike NBC, CBS and ABC, it did not have a radio network from which to draw big @ - @ name talent, affiliate loyalty or ratings. Its main priority in the coming months was to acquire the rights to CBS, ABC and other networks with a strong program rotation. Its main goal has been to develop a wide variety of quality new shows, and its show development strategy has been geared toward building original programming \u2014 and not so much its product. This team didn't only succeed on the high-quality, but on the low-quality. The biggest problem for NBC was its poor ratings \u2014 it was the first major network with more than one-third of the ratings from CBS. The only way to survive the NBC drop was to give CBS what it wanted for one more season. That's what NBC did: It dropped its big ratings (and other networks like it) but also gave them its best competition, especially the competition for its best new talent.\n\nOf course, there are many reasons why NBC has taken a major step backward lately. Its problems are so massive that they make it difficult to make any meaningful change in NBC. In 2015, for example, NBC had a 3.8% average rating for scripted, but just shy of 2% of its new scripted series came from scripted shows, making it difficult for CBS to generate big ratings beyond what it can generate from its scripted series.\n\nBut the NBC executives are right to say that NBC's failures today could be traced back to two reasons. First, that the series they produced was more popular among adults. NBC had a 1\/2-season pilot for NBC in 2017 compared to a 1\/2 season, and a smaller number of repeats for ABC on both lists, meaning fewer repeats are required for an 8.8% season. Second, the network was able to keep its programming costs down with the new rights. Since its original ratings for scripted networks fell from 2.4% (1.99 million adults 18-49 rating) in 2012-13 to 1.7% in 2013-14, NBC will have to rely more on its original programming, which was even more limited at 1.5% the year before.\n\nSo, if NBC's woes are not bad enough for you, CBS, you have to look no further than CBS' failure in 2017: Their 3.6% ratings and the 2.2% decline in ABC's 10-episode season ended with a 5.9% fall compared with the 1\/2-season, higher than any new series in a year for this network since 2006.\n\nIf you are looking for one more chance that NBC will never be able to survive, you should at least have watched my talk show about two years ago, Better Call Saul, which discussed the show's many flaws and why they were so terrible. For those interested in watching the network for a deeper look, watch this podcast with the team, with Michael Macdonald, and my colleague Steve Coen, who are in the midst of a two-part series about the show that will be airing this year as well as more of my previous projects, The Walking Dead.\n\n[youtube]https:\/\/fuse.me\/vnQv7l1g[\/youtube]\n\nAbout the author: Steve Coen is The Man Who Made Television.

{"id":3525,"ended":false,"length":686,"gen_text":"Bonnet is alleged to have been one of the few pirates to make his prisoners walk the plank. No contemporary source makes any mention of Bonnet forcing prisoners to walk the plank, and if so, it was in the writings of those who worked with him.\n\nThe fact is that while pirates were still working with Bonnet and others in order to obtain funds they could not afford to go on strike. In order to maintain the morale of his men, Bonnet was not afraid to attack any company he encountered in order to prove what he wanted to claim. According to William Butler Yeats ( 1785), \"In the year 1649, with the publication of The Pirates' Journal (London, 1896), Mr. Bonnet came under fire from the ship's baron, who said: 'The king of Portugal has come to make a large sacrifice for your ships in the port of Lengthenon... When they have made it, make your ships stand ready and leave us without ransom. As soon as there is a revolt in the north-West, make a large ransom of the money you have earned in the ports of the Portuguese in this country.'\" William of Averill's ( 1649 ) account of Bonnet's business with his fellow-prisoners clearly shows that Bonnet was the sort of one who became so furious at his own lack of interest in the fight against pirates that he went out into the sea to fight.\n\nThere are no historical sources relating to those who work today of any pirate who fought in the war, even that of William Butler Yeats. In that case, it is possible to guess from Yeats' accounts that in 1650 Bonnet broke with his captors and forced them to go on strike. In 1653, however, Bonnet joined with fellow prisoners and his people, such as the Spanish merchant John de Carlo, to take on the Spanish, who took up arms to block their move to join them on strike. Bonnet was not a \"hero of the south\". His fight against the prisoners with force seemed to last until 1649 when, for the first time, he decided to quit his post in the coast city of Averill. He took up arms against both of the prisoners by attacking them in what was described as an \"iron shield\", and also tried to attack the French officers who had taken part in the campaign. However, he did not make it through on the march. On 10 August 1654, following a strike by the first of these prisoners, Bonnet and his men, fighting again in the city of Averill, fell to death.\n\nIf Bonnet was a great pirate, that would have been a very interesting event, to see how he might be able to take a part in the war. After all, what did the British military have to show that they were on the point of slaughtering people they captured or were carrying back from France to a Portuguese village? For, it is no surprise that Bonnet was a great pirate, who fought in the war by fighting among himself and others.\n\nHowever, for those who saw him as a great man and who saw him as a man of war, and were willing to pay the penalty of making war against the British of the south, it was a very strange thing to see him in action.

{"id":1245,"ended":false,"length":680,"gen_text":"In 1924 Gerard Olivier, a habitually frugal man, told his son that not only must he gain admission to the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art, but he must also find the time to go in the field to read and write. During the winter, he spent time in Paris writing poetry for a period of eighteen months. Gerard, who was in the field, said that he could not attend school because he was ill and lost his right hand.\n\nThe author is the son of Fran\u00e7ois de la Traviatti, and his parents are Henri and Eugenie, and his mother was Anne, the mother of Charles de Boer (who was one of the first members of the French nobility). As for Gerard, his first books, with which he learned, were: his novel Alma: A Natural History of Man, and the Tale of a Woman (1957). One of his first books was a story about the lives of the great, who, upon the death of their young, were to go to a new place, to learn about their new lives.\n\nAt 14 years old Gerard made his debut in Tregaard de Dijon on 18 June, 1955. He had spent last year of the spring preparing for his graduation from Tregaard, where the Academy of Sciences was organized in October. The university was set up in Tregaard on 18 May. However, after four years there was the question of how to ensure his graduation. On 26 June the President of Tregaard, G. Jurgen Wiekert, gave a speech at the Academy to which he accepted Gerard and he declared, \"He who does not read must give himself up and lose the rest of his life on this day, as in this century.\"\n\nAs the President mentioned, his last book, Alma: A Natural History of Man (1957), was published in 1970. On June 26, 1987, the Academy of Sciences gave him a Nobel Prize. The Academy of Sciences did not recognize his contribution with the respect it should due to his life during that time. The Nobel peace prize was awarded at the end of 1994 until 2001 at which point he passed away from cancer.\n\nBernard was a member of President Louis XV's staff, and a member of the Board of Deputies. When he is not serving in the President's service for another six years he has a number of interesting works, such as the book I (The Book of the Seven Wonders of Nature ), which was published in 1988, and the book I. In 2006 he wrote this essay to accompany an article on his biography.\n\nBernard is survived by his two children, Charles, a widow (daughter of French artist and poet Louisa Traviatti) and Jean-Michel (father of the French poet Thomas Michel II), and seven grandchildren: one of whom is also survived by his daughter Marne.\n\nIn 1994, the French Parliament passed a bill legalizing marriage for men and women. The amendment was passed by a two-thirds vote, but only in 1993 it was considered to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Tribunal, which had ordered it to remove the law. The two main factions representing some of French society's leading thinkers of the 19th century and 20th century agree and believe the legislation to be unconstitutional (some have even called it \"the most unjust law in France\"). However the law was also declared unconstitutional by the House of Representatives where it was put into public domain.\n\nThe author wishes to express his gratitude to all who have contributed so far.\n\nNotes","token_len":735,"entropy":[11.7864,13.2755,10.1612,1.1814,1.2852,12.181,1.6957,6.6686,0.9148,0.0335,2.9711,0.6666,6.6246,1.2966,3.3533,1.801,6.9304,0.9241,5.1886,1.1455,7.6983,6.27,0.3213,1.0815,9.0104,2.4122,1.2047,8.015,9.3483,3.2627,8.9535,0.4014,2.1481,0.8475,0.2567,1.3356,0.4271,0.5258,4.7146,2.5285,3.7006,0.4543,3.6069,4.6284,1.5285,3.663,3.4293,5.1041,2.2072,0.9271,0.8779,5.8044,1.0544,2.9708,2.1642,1.4572,2.8666,4.2505,1.1751,4.2356,4.8718,2.3927,2.9201,2.313,5.4155,0.3909,5.4751,0.2777,0.9109,3.9243,3.0326,1.2796,1.4511,3.6058,1.9108,4.0215,2.05,5.1916,0.9207,0.8787,3.1931,1.0579,5.1983,2.0319,2.5534,0.8313,1.0357,3.3139,1.2423,5.8775,0.6463,5.0315,1.6543,0.612,2.5487,0.0058,2.2964,6.2298,4.1402,3.7451,1.909,0.0504,5.4396,3.8739,2.6939,5.2651,2.2733,2.6671,4.6161,0.6195,3.5984,2.0167,2.985,2.3387,4.5992,1.4398,4.689,0.6407,0.2318,2.5028,2.2822,1.4512,1.8735,1.8427,5.1114,2.116,2.1593,2.6512,0.0376,4.0916,1.4103,5.3566,1.0937,3.9067,2.8488,1.4329,4.4449,0.0251,0.3155,2.3949,4.3609,0.0208,0.2067,2.0324,3.3505,1.3089,4.6088,2.8753,2.2533,0.4502,1.6858,4.2958,5.1772,3.3103,5.5677,2.4646,0.174,4.1935,2.7961,0.572,4.2966,5.7729,3.8374,11.2055,3.9874,1.7228,5.7687,0.2986,0.6052,4.2921,1.0208,1.7503,1.8573,5.6629,0.0558,2.1116,4.0657,3.0692,1.3179,4.3715,1.3035,5.6829,0.3722,0.6973,1.9626,1.8353,1.0468,2.4874,3.5177,1.45,1.681,5.6202,0.0845,1.9858,4.2371,5.5057,3.5433,2.8679,4.9877,2.0788,1.2634,0.035,1.1126,5.6053,3.5473,1.8842,4.5247,3.3185,0.8659,3.0164,3.6746,3.451,1.7997,1.9896,3.7146,2.7503,2.0758,3.3364,2.4355,0.8227,1.7526,0.0002,4.7699,6.0048,1.1952,0.5943,1.9059,4.5582,0.8591,2.3071,0.6657,6.5259,5.9393,5.2673,3.7186,3.7032,5.1375,3.6716,0.0877,4.0206,5.128,2.3047,2.0158,5.4233,0.7161,1.1471,2.4342,4.4374,6.0048,1.3275,3.282,2.1293,4.698,5.8698,0.4726,1.2943,2.9505,1.6923,2.8656,0.0906,0.0091,0.0024,1.9437,2.5237,3.469,3.4568,1.3199,2.3518,2.1512,4.6928,3.3239,4.2339,1.2725,2.5982,4.9737,1.4361,4.5949,0.0687,1.0761,3.5806,0.0207,0.0094,0.003,2.6528,3.0457,2.3032,2.519,5.8145,0.1431,3.5898,4.6077,0.7366,4.2201,1.4685,4.5284,3.6651,0.234,3.3279,0.7529,5.2328,2.6474,2.8816,0.6449,3.6785,4.4744,1.4195,2.5499,4.4767,0.7339,1.6282,0.0121,0.0039,0.0028,1.485,5.3314,2.3302,3.1878,5.8387,0.3079,4.9498,3.4795,5.1884,3.517,0.2225,3.4571,1.8161,2.3631,1.9882,0.6445,2.8167,3.4401,2.2989,2.2503,5.3892,1.7314,3.7415,4.8494,5.1383,2.6748,0.4775,3.6614,2.8574,3.3641,0.0493,3.421,4.1144,5.134,3.4162,0.2764,3.0683,4.2404,2.3553,5.5994,0.3317,0.0878,1.3172,5.4818,2.5964,2.6714,2.649,3.0379,4.2076,3.6464,3.983,0.925,1.291,0.0002,4.0769,2.378,4.0642,5.589,0.7628,3.87,4.5052,1.1515,1.2021,1.8412,0.5378,0.0664,0.0247,0.0005,0.0714,0.0117,2.8409,0.1825,0.38,0.091,0.5972,0.7612,0.6212,5.9368,0.5493,3.8681,4.8298,2.7568,0.4316,5.4908,0.7074,1.6766,1.1942,0.8541,0.176,3.4057,2.0682,1.2643,3.9594,0.4998,1.0469,2.6714,1.9948,1.6716,0.4185,3.8886,0.1127,3.0102,2.1428,4.3088,6.3542,1.6023,4.825,1.5787,4.0753,4.6883,0.1696,0.7527,4.9482,5.5227,2.4533,0.826,0.3774,2.7057,3.6268,6.9913,0.396,0.9715,1.3045,4.7093,0.5692,2.0564,0.0027,4.6581,7.6418,5.0099,5.1824,0.9629,0.9295,1.6651,5.0247,0.0748,3.1557,1.777,0.3234,0.7114,0.0002,5.1623,0.0988,3.2941,1.7542,2.2335,0.0268,7.5956,4.8213,2.4367,1.2527,4.2586,1.9439,1.248,3.5454,0.9933,0.0297,0.4654,3.8552,0.0728,3.3326,0.006,1.9947,4.7031,0.9383,5.6208,0.2908,5.3214,1.3439,0.8407,3.188,0.1298,4.9491,5.758,5.5748,2.5783,0.249,2.2933,2.4874,3.2336,4.3789,0.006,5.3507,3.1004,2.3289,2.6119,0.0018,1.7736,3.0474,5.4937,5.2401,3.2257,5.2318,0.1627,1.8026,4.6366,3.3286,0.7467,3.5051,6.6551,1.2415,1.5346,0.6466,0.354,4.2313,1.5261,0.5368,1.0554,1.7005,2.6692,3.2231,4.2217,5.2396,0.707,2.0474,5.4409,3.3504,4.8062,3.7886,3.2451,0.7405,1.9108,2.0216,4.6768,1.6339,0.7903,0.0002,1.7503,0.0055,2.0055,1.2722,0.0018,0.1323,3.1896,2.1173,0.6241,4.5794,2.0715,3.3277,4.559,4.1143,3.7905,0.1838,5.5737,4.1494,3.1566,2.3404,3.5968,4.6231,4.4865,0.5369,0.2668,0.0011,1.3464,0.2392,3.6092,1.2272,3.0757,0.0011,2.7662,2.7457,0.151,2.0188,1.9329,2.5712,5.6935,2.9932,5.5637,1.646,0.7209,6.5664,0.1094,4.245,4.7613,1.6061,0.4296,0.5643,4.4678,3.0502,0.0239,0.2923,3.5213,5.8078,4.9621,1.5223,1.0541,0.0002,3.8466,5.3271,1.3764,2.0063,2.8449,5.2699,1.1369,1.0073,2.6868,4.3478,4.8391,2.6081,3.2973,1.0045,0.8541,1.726,1.6285,5.5431,1.3483,2.6836,1.0113,1.7423,4.6018,0.2236,0.0109,0.5146,2.0511,2.6356,3.3524,2.8246,5.3525,2.5534,0.3136,4.1843,2.2517,0.1378,1.036,2.3535,0.412,2.4408,6.5886,2.9544,1.1632,3.6085,3.7709,1.7626,1.0966,5.2402,0.8232,2.5839,0.858,1.7132,4.9621,4.0306,4.8623,6.6171,6.0425,1.5545,5.6479,0.9532,1.53,2.3326,2.6305,4.5833,0.2156,3.099,0.01,0.2196,3.0043,2.7995,0.0009,0.1134,5.2351,4.6996,4.442,2.2629,4.1534,2.4652,0.2632,0.8384,5.4298,5.5476,3.5381,1.6481,1.9466,0.393,1.6978,1.981,3.2586,4.7182,0.7384,0.6217,1.8773,1.2896,3.7821,3.412,2.0645,1.8689,3.9988,4.8658,0.4344,0.9929,0.4318,6.1584,0.0496,0.667,6.071,0.9814,0.8858,4.5259,2.0331,6.8242,2.4459,1.2774,0.912,0.0002,2.533,2.8066,4.02

{"id":1962,"ended":true,"length":668,"gen_text":"Coached by Mike Ruddock, Wales won their first Grand Slam since 1978 and their first ever Six Nations Grand Slam in 2005. A late long range penalty from Gavin Henson gave them a three-goal lead in the third quarter before Toulon put the home side ahead in five minutes when Giorgia Kolasinac was sent off for roughing Rene Foteau as time expired. The match took another two days to settle down once again and before half time Wales scored the only shot of the third quarter on the opening charge of the second half. However, it could only mean one thing for New Zealand after being beaten 3-2 at Rugby World Cup quarter term and the referee, Stuart Kavanagh made a red card following a hit to Anthony Furlong. Australia were again level one minute before half time with 20 minutes left. Despite being in a tough group with the hosts, Wales remained in action and scored once again but Rene Foteau picked up the foul and made a left hand move to end the scoring at 10-15 after a second try. A penalty with 11 seconds left saw Gareth Ruddy, the New Zealand captain, go close on a breakaway from the line and set the ball up for Richie L'Engle, but there was no attempt on the next try from Chris Eubanks to force a conversion which was then completed by Michael Morgan. In the dying minutes the game had been won by an Australian side without an answer on the scoreboard. Rene Foteau had a few words in response to a call that the game would be lost after three consecutive days of penalty calls. But for Rivahe and Hameed, the result means that if they could have made a dramatic turnaround in the early minutes on Saturday, their hopes of upsetting New Zealand would have been reduced even further. It was their second successive defeat in South Africa that they could not get the win in any of their three previous Tests and despite conceding just seven points they could have looked to take the lead after just 15 minutes and three minutes. But when it was about to go their way, they gave up. They did have a short term opportunity in the second half when one of their best defenders took off at the fullback post and got a touch with the ball but they were too small to make a play. Rene Foteau found the end of one of the first five New Zealand tries and the Kiwis then scored the winner in 20 minutes but their defeat ended a remarkable run of form in South Africa. Toulon and Samoa scored three tries as Rene Foteau set up Michael Morgan to play the third try and then scored on a brilliant try when Paul Egan replaced Niki Ashton from the penalty area at 15.22.\nPosted by rue.f.harvard at 3:08 PM\nHello there...\nThis article is updated daily on Wednesday 5th November\nWelcome, everyone!

During the season, the Tigers allowed an average of 101 @., good enough for fifth in the NFL in rushing (25), just behind LSU (25). As a team, the team didn't play strong on offense and made less than 3 rushing attempts every 5-10 plays.\n\n's defense played weak on offense and made less than 3 rushing attempts every 5-10 plays. Clemson never came out for any drives or gained more than 10 yards on the ground against Clemson's secondary.\n\n. Clemson's defense looked like more complete teams while holding the Tigers in average yards per game.\n\n. In its fourth year, Louisville's defense played a big role in the win on both sides of the ball.\n\n.' Louisville's defense looked like more complete teams while holding the Tigers in average yards per game.\n\n. Clemson went 0-for-6 from the field and just a few plays later, Clemson's starting quarterback (Jonathan Johnson) ran a 4th down attempt to give the Tigers some easy scoring opportunities which turned into a 31-yard field goal attempt.\n\nThe Tigers'defense finally turned the ball over once and for all.\n\nOn Sunday's win, Clemson's two running backs were forced into two incompletions and scored three more points. The defense did give two plays- three and seven-out, respectively.-\n\nAfter the season, it appeared as if the offense had become more balanced after their passing game. On average, Clemson had allowed 27.5 QB hits in the first four games of the season and allowed 30.0 QB hits in the final three. At this point, though, there was not much offense to be found. The only time Clemson ever had one carry over two plays was in the second half, when they went 2-for-11 on downs over four, going 11-for-23 on passes.\n\nIt would appear that Clemson's running game will have some kind of issue with the passing game, but it appears as though it will be a major issue in 2017.\n\nWhat should be a big problem in 2017:\n\n'2016: Clemson's running game is lacking consistency despite the first team rushing record at QB.\n\n'2016: Clemson's running game is lacking consistency despite the second team rushing record at QB. What does this mean for the 2017 season?\n\nWhat should be a big problem in 2017: One of the more difficult part of the season for Clemson's running game is the lack of depth on offense.\n\nOne of the more difficult part of the season for Clemson's running game is the lack of depth on offense. The Tigers have allowed 10 passing touchdowns in a season in which there are at least one TD thrown since '02. These are tied for 6th in the NFL behind Kansas City's 6, Baltimore's (7) 9 and San Francisco's 7.\n\nThis time last year, the Tigers had 13 rushing touchdowns on seven carries.\n\nThis time last season, the Tigers had 13 rushing touchdowns on seven carries. The following is a stat from the 2015 season by The Clemson Basketball Analysis Team:\n\nThis could very well be the end of the term. This could very well be the end of this season for Clemson (though it will do something to bolster the offense on the defensive end this season).","token_len":738,"entropy":[10.6443,2.4754,3.6097,2.2516,10.2183,1.5799,1.3868,7.5154,1.8725,5.9264,0.7009,3.7121,0.0638,0.1831,1.2868,0.331,3.2569,3.8854,0.1388,0.0572,5.4576,17.6526,5.8671,10.7969,8.9568,3.1229,0.2427,2.487,3.3606,1.2491,0.3938,1.8373,5.1261,2.475,0.4912,3.3442,0.7967,0.115,5.5846,2.379,1.8427,3.5295,5.4329,3.0019,5.7045,1.0715,4.636,1.0164,2.3219,0.6221,1.5633,0.0006,12.7172,1.0064,0.0216,0.1574,0.0084,0.001,0.0039,0.0009,0.0033,0.0009,10.3707,0.0004,0.004,0.0003,0.0024,0.0009,0.0011,0.001,0.1696,0.1911,10.3904,0.0784,0.0001,0.0042,0.533,0.0006,0.0009,0.0018,0.002,0.0111,0.001,0.0016,0.0061,0.0066,0.0046,0.0047,0.0007,0.0011,0.1781,5.5096,1.2253,1.3303,0.0655,1.0106,6.3622,5.6702,0.0004,3.2502,5.9383,3.4161,2.2135,3.3098,5.0773,5.2568,1.4601,4.1815,4.5327,0.1393,4.2588,5.376,4.6641,0.6662,2.3344,0.4795,1.3634,0.0002,8.2547,1.0327,2.9995,2.028,0.7272,0.017,0.0042,0.0041,0.0027,0.0008,0.1408,0.0079,0.0015,0.0077,0.0073,0.0003,0.0025,0.0137,0.0006,1.941,5.5492,5.2383,2.4752,5.2538,5.1817,4.2271,3.43,4.9628,0.6456,0.0452,2.8514,0.2363,0.9036,1.7027,0.0927,4.5925,3.0816,0.8395,4.4853,0.3077,0.5141,0.0002,5.5603,1.6638,1.2584,0.5867,4.7219,1.443,6.4001,6.5185,2.0908,5.814,4.6478,2.1662,0.5204,4.3452,5.0603,1.4116,0.4118,1.8751,1.4497,0.5353,0.0002,1.2697,5.7353,4.639,4.1944,2.0564,1.3689,6.5082,2.2305,0.3949,4.1243,2.4221,4.5723,0.8365,0.2026,1.4194,3.6223,4.5815,4.5652,0.4292,0.0893,0.0131,0.0207,0.2858,1.235,0.0002,8.2616,2.0085,0.8264,0.3995,1.7426,0.3872,0.0649,0.0155,0.0135,0.0879,0.029,0.0093,0.0225,0.0038,0.0038,0.0036,0.0008,0.0125,0.0044,0.4707,0.0002,0.6888,2.7995,5.6912,4.1517,0.0638,1.4336,0.0013,2.806,2.1781,0.4356,0.4595,1.9825,4.214,4.6373,2.2261,1.7057,1.3883,0.502,1.877,1.8197,4.9926,0.7706,4.6608,5.0426,4.569,0.0275,3.4466,2.3852,3.5428,3.8839,1.5169,4.2629,2.042,3.3024,0.7996,0.4231,5.1661,5.0766,2.3376,1.8753,7.9318,4.9007,0.8,1.0753,4.6794,0.3159,2.0765,1.9596,0.0045,3.3819,0.8828,0.5008,0.0005,3.9615,0.9527,9.5937,16.1424,6.1233,7.133,4.1942,1.9849,1.0457,0.019,4.1393,3.3764,1.082,0.0049,1.6018,1.1101,0.0004,4.3188,2.9559,4.3209,2.9011,1.0282,0.9993,1.9059,6.6372,5.3117,0.1288,2.4888,3.526,2.2663,4.914,3.316,0.0014,0.0002,1.9913,5.3257,3.9556,2.9689,1.2131,1.0724,2.2169,4.113,4.0737,4.8257,6.1286,3.5976,5.3989,5.2668,4.6635,4.5585,2.9379,5.3729,1.9806,0.4621,6.3343,4.4702,0.0005,4.5163,1.5875,6.5326,0.5176,2.8842,4.5426,1.9009,0.7686,0.8838,3.9069,2.1411,4.422,1.7639,2.8044,3.3816,4.5964,5.1867,1.19,1.5173,3.7411,4.9477,0.0899,1.3964,2.7364,4.0582,5.6789,0.9948,1.7637,3.5075,1.625,2.6207,1.0414,1.4791,2.9307,0.4223,0.8029,0.1439,0.3201,2.2154,3.1319,5.2148,0.3671,2.6754,0.3863,0.1128,0.3012,0.2604,1.5589,1.3389,1.2846,4.9107,3.1878,0.3582,0.4726,3.8205,0.0203,3.3883,1.2092,4.1826,0.3746,5.7204,1.5231,1.8433,2.3532,1.2653,2.2795,3.1696,4.1153,0.8298,4.0836,2.0303,4.6348,5.2259,3.2243,3.7851,2.3563,0.5861,1.1127,0.4386,2.0435,0.4099,3.4958,0.2246,1.7067,3.8354,3.2879,0.123,0.2192,0.001,3.5909,1.8441,3.8992,6.8323,3.5453,6.3874,5.1637,3.8557,0.281,0.0493,0.001,3.4759,1.105,5.1518,1.7275,1.148,0.0007,3.8174,3.567,2.2085,0.4667,1.8342,0.9046,4.1755,0.2253,3.5344,2.9754,3.1479,4.5066,0.004,5.1849,2.0978,1.5266,1.0571,0.0449,2.3056,1.7184,1.9573,3.4321,1.7407,0.5122,1.9978,1.2359,1.1422,2.0193,3.6146,0.7126,2.3968,2.9595,0.3661,1.2923,0.0005,4.8521,4.5952,1.7349,1.7927,2.8256,2.5812,2.6211,0.6212,4.1458,0.7649,0.0004,4.2684,5.512,1.4757,1.8541,1.3324,2.621,0.1741,1.965,5.8048,4.4569,5.7124,2.6069,5.8891,3.8178,2.0437,2.5208,3.4501,5.2941,0.7749,1.3988,0.0003,1.6933,0.8687,0.011,0.8614,0.1033,0.4219,0.1006,0.0472,0.0612,0.0493,0.0122,0.0068,4.1879,0.019,0.0224,0.0014,0.002,0.0313,0.0142,7.1752,3.8629,1.1079,0.1716,0.386,1.067,2.3124,0.3103,0.3616,0.5263,0.0003,3.2914,1.3152,0.0426,0.0183,0.1648,0.5764,0.2897,0.0392,0.0132,7.1004,1.1116,0.2161,4.033,3.1816,5.0927,0.2921,1.1756,1.1876,1.3599,0.5545,1.8747,1.3981,0.4743,0.9392,2.188,2.5369,0.0021,3.986,2.3225,0.9259,0.3258,1.3718,0.0004,4.3843,0.014,0.0015,0.0251,0.0036,0.0374,0.001,0.0009,0.0052,0.0011,0.0021,0.0009,0.0066,0.1073,0.0028,0.0009,0.0065,0.0004,0.0004,0.0045,0.0065,0.0009,1.9979,1.6857,2.1714,3.526,4.5423,4.7011,0.2641,1.3829,3.998,1.6535,3.3279,0.0354,4.1879,2.2265,1.9884,0.0022,4.2437,5.2686,1.8242,6.3932,5.607,4.4725,0.4498,6.0146,1.1657,4.5873,0.1557,4.9748,0.0052,0.8744,0.1126,0.5952,4.9306,3.9257,0.1762,2.2598,5.6531,2.6523,5.4234,0.0113,7.9276,2.2718,1.3631,3.8034,0.6866,3.1087,0.5049,0.0365,3.0358,0.3624,0.783,0.0003,3.0822,6.4885,0.6511,0.3288,0.1318,1.3569,0.6438,2.0134,5.4592,2.3981,0.3711,3.2483,5.4116,1.2715,1.1568,2.0999,0.0003,1.8609,0.1258,0.0032,3.2106,0.0081,0.0531,0.0077,0.0544,0.1913,0.006,0.0094,0.0041,0.0263,0.0076,0.0035,1.8982,4.4513,2.442,0.8977,5.9116,1.3406,1.6663,2.6575,0.3206,5.0342,4.6535,5.1962,6.3172,4.1729,1.9597,1.272,0.1744,0.0004,3.4476,6.5244,3.1411,0.0265,0.4145,1.0215,3.0458,0.3906,0.8883,6.394,2.1986,3.8725,2.3862,0.4796,0.0199,0.1496,0.5507,0.0977,0.0163,4.1322,0.8591,1

{"id":316,"ended":false,"length":670,"gen_text":"Some sources give Stephen's place of birth as Marylebone, London, others as Glasgow. The eldest of eleven children in a `` closely @ - @ knit... family ``, her final name is Anne Babbage '. She is unmarried.[4] The other children include Margaret Babbage's second wife, Elizabeth Elizabeth, and Ann Babbage's third wife, Henry Babbage '. When Margaret married her second daughter, Anne's father was Prince of Wales Robert Davies [5]. Andrew Lawrence is listed as the father of Margaret, and at her death at the age of 60, Margaret became the new wife of Lord Edward's daughter, Lady Elizabeth II. The other children of Elizabeth and Andrew Lawrence include Anne Henry Charles's first wife, William Duke Andrew. A father of three children including one niece, Anne Anne Luthard, died in May 2010 at the age of 80.[6] Margaret was also an early follower of the philosophy of Marylebone and later Marylebone-style family, founded in 1593 using her daughter's own name.[7] This school of thought spread through Scotland, and among the younger Elizabethan immigrants was Marylebone. In 1599, Sir Frederick Wilshaw, a pupil of Marylebone and a resident of Westminster Abbey, wrote a letter urging the public to give her the title, Anne, which was later shortened to Anne Luthard.[8] In 1608, Marylebone was the first Catholic church built in Scotland, and the church's founder had a daughter named Catherine. When Marylebone established as church in Leicestershire in 1592, it soon went out-of-business and became known as Anne Leice [9]. The only surviving parish church is Marylebone, and in 1702 this convent church was built at St Clement's, a place where the two sisters met in 1536.[10] In the seventeenth century, Marylebone became a major cultural center for Scottish culture and history. It was the centre of the British Isles where the famous James Bond film The Spy Who Lived was filmed. It was also home to an important Scottish literary society dedicated to literature, arts, theatre and musical studies.[11][8] In 1612, a major Scottish nationalist party named The People's Democratic Alliance elected a new leader named Robert James: John Theodosius Jameson II of the Christian Church who would succeed Edward I of London on the throne.[12][13] The Catholic Church in Scotland was the first of numerous church institutions founded in Europe with Mary, Marylebone, the Leicestershire Catholic Church, and other notable Christian denominations. Among them were the Catholic Church in Wales [14], of which the Irish Parliament at Dublin approved the consecration of a new Pope. Other prominent Catholic denominations within Europe included the British Presbyterian Church there and the Catholic Church of Prussia.\n\n[4] Mary, daughter of Mary-Ain, is the only daughter of King Edward VIII - and a Catholic nun - in North America.\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\n\u2191 \"The Old Women of England of 1599\", in Annals of Church History, edited (Cambridge University Press, 1986), p. 40 \u2191 Annals of Church History, Cambridge University Press, 1984, p. 4\n\n\u2191 Sarah, \"An Irish Preacher to the Pope in 1543\", N.I.F., in C.

{"id":2398,"ended":false,"length":655,"gen_text":"A cast copper alloy penannular collar of special interest to archaeologists has been found at the campsite. It may indicate that this hilltop site was used even before the Iron Age, since related materials are known to have been found there since those times, suggesting that iron could be used for penne and brass writing for a period of decades.\n\nThe new finds are the latest of 12 discovered by the team using an array of digital photography and analysis tools.\n\nThe group said its research showed the team didn't find any stone-piercing iron objects at the site but rather found three bronze and four gold objects, all located along a pathway with two other objects.\n\n\"We are very happy with the findings but for now we are focusing on our next step\u2014 the discovery of a site for use as a post mortem stone,\" said lead researcher Scott Lees, from the Institute for Archaeology at the University of Birmingham, who led the research.\n\n\"The new findings give us an understanding of where there is evidence of iron and the use of such tools, so we are very excited about it.\"\n\nThe team found iron in about 8,600 of the 13,000-strong campsite, with one found between 0800 and 0800 m from shore. They found a bronze bronze cylinder measuring 5.15-metres, which was found on the site only a few hundred meters from the site. At 0600 m, the find was found on the edge of a rock face where the same cylindrical metal sphere was found. The two objects are also linked through three small stone-pellet-like objects.\n\n\"Our research shows that the oldest stone from the North Sea, and only one the largest found in this area, is in the group of Stonehenge, at the location mentioned earlier,\" Lees explained in a press release. \"The finding of this is important in an extremely important project to investigate the relationship between iron and penne and steel writing over a period of decades.\"\n\nWhile this Stonehenge site is one of the oldest known sites in England for Bronze Age writing, the site was used at present because of the ability to create new material during the early Iron Age.\n\nThe team used a 3D imaging tool called a stereoscope to measure the composition of the iron and found three objects ranging in size from 11 metric ton to 4.5 metric ton. The team has yet to make final determination about their findings and is unsure whether they were found in a Stonehenge community or in nearby, smaller groups.\n\nAlthough new work is yet to be done, the new findings have brought the total number of found on Stonehenge to 13,000, which is one for each of the 13,000-strong team, all of whom are active members of the Stonehenge archaeological complex.\n\n\"A much smaller group of Stonehengeites was found on the beach a few years ago,\" Lees said, \"but we found them a few hundred meters away from the main site by chance, so we hope to use our expertise in 3D scanning technology to investigate the site and find these two tools. This indicates that the most important tool of Stonehenge may not have been used at the time it was built, although it certainly was used in other sites in North Wales.\n\n\"In addition to this work, we have a much wider array of other research that is very focused on the location of iron on Stonehenge. There may be more stone left on the beach, which may reflect this very different role of stone in

{"id":3385,"ended":false,"length":668,"gen_text":"Upon the release of Hands All Over, due to the strong digital downloads, `` Hands All Over `` appeared on the national charts in South Korea and Spain. The song debuted and peaked at No. 1 in the Billboard 200 worldwide chart on September 6th and sold over 50 million copies with No. 51 on the country's national chart.\nAn interesting finding about Hands All Over may be the lack of an official opening.\nWith the release of Hand All Over, and its subsequent popularity during Korea's three-week festival festival in North Korea where concerts are held every 5-8 weeks, the group was unable to have any official show. On the other hand, the Korean version of Hands All Over aired on Korean TV for only seven days, but it was released on the same day. If any one of those seven days were long enough, it could have resulted in the group giving up the live show with little fanfare. In recent years, when the singer's fan base is strong, the fans on both sides of the Korean Korean border have become more active.\nHowever, some of the other songs on Hands All Over may still appear on the national charts in South Korea or Spain. As of now, the song is not listed as an American or Japanese song but is rather recorded by a South Korean singer named \"Kim Jong Il's Orchestra\"; The Korean pop group's latest album released January 25th, is named \" \".\nIn December 2015, Kim Jong Il's Orchestra produced the album \"Woo Jae Hwa\" by Korea's most famous band that featured Kim Jong Un. That album opened with \"Woo Jae Hwa\" at number 5 on the Korean rock charts with an opening number of No. 15 and No. 24 respectively.\nAlthough Kim Jong Il has repeatedly said that he would like to rekindle the spirit of their music, which was supposed to be a live performance with the Korean singer before release, that concert has been canceled. On the radio, the song was included as a two-part song. There is one major discrepancy with the song saying that Hands All Over will be performed in August. Other discrepancies have been reported at the various stages of the band's life.\nThe group's official biography on Mydaily (\uc804\uc774 \uc5ec\ub97c, \uc5ec\ud53c \ub098\ub2c8\ud06c\ub3f4\uc2a4\ud51c) mentions that the recording of the song was completed in August 2015.\nSinger Kim Jong Il's performance on \"Woo Jae Hwa\" is credited with forming new band for this album.\nSince the group's live debut on October 7th, this song has been sold over 2,000,000 times on the online market. It has two versions: one for Korea's famous Hand All Over show (in the south where they held their live shows on July 5-6, 2015, and in the North where they held their live shows on July 6-7, 2015 ), one for the show in Seoul where the main dancers of the main concert (Hee Jae Hwa in front of the camera as well as for the tour group during the live sessions at the same time), and two for Kim Jong

It was nominated for an Academy Award and received two nominations.\n\nA note from the producers : The season 1 episode has been set up by director of photography and production staff Amy Zander for episode seven. Her character, a young, nerdy girl named Lina, plays a member of Lina's party. Despite being extremely young, she is extremely smart, has high level of communication skills, can communicate easily during the conversation, and likes books.\n\nIn an effort to make an episode as dark and depressing as possible, Amy and Lina have teamed up with the producers and director of photography, T.J. Bowers. In addition, Amy and Lina set up a set up of cameras that will film when they are not in the room (which the producers want to cut before the pilot). The producers will set up the set up so that Amy will be able to stay put while Amy's face is hidden by her glasses. The camera is then on the set for a few more minutes before being cut. The two are later seen together after the episode concludes.\n\n\nQuotes\n\n\"The last time he died, Mr. Noggin, he said, \"Now.\" And I mean, I was just so, so sad for I should have been at my little girl's funeral last year, but what was that I thought of that didn't do, where she had to live a long time to make that movie for myself? (pause) I was like, I just, it just doesn't happen with kids. I was like, you know, that was really funny, man. I got so, so sad that I had to go through all the tears that I'd endured at the time. I did I. It's a gift, you know? For him. He said, \"Now.\" He had one last wish. If you had another one, that just would have meant that we had to pay for it now. (pause) And I would've been like, \"Well, who, wait a second, it's a gift for this kid?\" (pause) I would have.... I guess they were on that. It just seems like, I mean, I just have to believe that when a kid's alive, all of these good boys will take care of that. It just seems so strange. It just never happened to me that he was gonna die. And he did, and the only kid I remember, and no child I ever heard of in my life, did the same, but he was very, very sad. (pause) It just seems as if he didn't really see it yet (chuckle). (chuckle) I'll never forget when I saw that one.

{"id":3611,"ended":false,"length":697,"gen_text":"Mazatec shamans crush the leaves to extract leaf juices from about 20 to 80 ( about < unk > \/ 2 oz to < unk > \/ 7 oz. ) or more fresh leaves, usually about one or more of the same variety or cultivars. The leaves turn white because of the heat. Many people are also allergic to the fungus.\n\nWhen leaves are cut, a small droplet of glue is used to wrap the leaf. About 20 times a year after leaves are cut the fungus destroys them using a strong heat-pumping agent. It is also used to add flavor to leaves and make new leaves or flowers. The fungus will grow inside the leaves and can become self-harvesting if stored on soil for at least 72 hours. If leaves are held up to this treatment, any root fungus may be eaten.\n\nMany plants have a distinctive scent like cherry and other fruits like jasmine, rose, and other fruits that make your mouth smell like a new flower leaves. They are known as \"leaved herbs\", and the odor is a mixture of sweet and sour. They have been reported in several different parts of India in the past as \"trees.\" These stems are small and hard, like jasmine, and they produce bitter (pungent) flavor when combined with the leaves' acidic properties.\n\nThe scent is so distinctive that many people start taking medicine to calm the scent. At first, there are no specific ways to treat the perfume, but gradually several remedies could be used over a two days period. If that works as well, the leaves can begin to look like leaves. By the end of three days, leaves are no longer very fragrant, and the smell is only mildly unpleasant.\n\nThe fungus spreads through soil. It grows by spreading seeds through soil and then by releasing spores from their tiny intestines or from contaminated soil. The seed is destroyed, then the fruit leaves are removed. Depending upon the time of year, the fungus will multiply and produce two to six different types of plant. Plants can only grow on hard soil, particularly organic soil, for a period of several years. If used at the right temperature, the fungus can be used on the outside of soil.\n\nThe leaves may form with small holes that run about the outside of a plant. These allow the leaves to turn dark brown and some color.\n\nWhat should I do with the leaves?\n\nThe leaves turn black because the fungus can spread to many surfaces of the plant. This may not be a problem with most, but it is not an unusual occurrence in people who are allergic to the fungus.\n\nThe leaves may also be found on fruit trees, roots, branches, leaves on leaves that are near the edges of the plant, or other plants. After removing the fungus, the leaves turn black again and are not seen on fruits. This will not remove the fungus completely, but it can leave the leaves red.\n\n, but it can leave the leaves red. It is not possible to kill the fungus completely by eating the leaves. To kill the fungus, soak them in water for several hours, then drain them off. There may be a good chance that the leaves are released into the soil, making it much easier to kill it. Some people get the leaves to go cold, when in extreme heat.\n\nAs with the leaves, eating the leaves is a good idea in the absence of any symptoms from the allergy to the fungus or the symptoms on the foliage of the plant (which is similar to what you see when cutting dried leaves to make them more beautiful ).\n\nReferences","token_len":741,"entropy":[8.2063,10.1593,7.3546,11.532,0.977,12.5945,1.7128,9.0987,3.3749,4.4125,9.4373,5.9126,2.0724,9.7572,3.1795,2.5536,5.4851,7.4005,9.0852,9.2249,11.8632,5.6126,6.0668,7.2067,2.4824,6.1974,6.1934,2.5496,2.4504,0.0293,0.5729,0.9149,5.7235,0.6874,4.739,1.3544,4.1089,4.1642,8.1664,1.0875,2.2069,4.8595,2.616,3.925,2.5637,3.0265,2.84,0.6521,2.4387,3.7848,3.7431,3.0035,0.7834,0.9888,1.9557,1.7782,6.4191,2.225,5.9032,0.9795,0.9341,4.0987,1.8215,5.7058,2.7742,3.5275,4.4556,3.4763,0.0601,1.6833,4.5033,1.6035,1.5692,0.0058,4.4052,3.9797,0.4329,3.1987,1.2421,3.5681,2.7781,5.508,0.1358,0.5271,5.7716,1.0479,2.2019,0.2705,4.9729,0.5626,2.0384,1.7771,6.0503,2.6005,5.397,1.5154,1.3806,6.3474,2.5783,0.1322,0.2395,3.1892,2.6317,4.9505,2.525,5.795,1.3823,4.6976,5.0035,4.1011,5.2388,0.615,0.814,1.2144,3.4555,1.1452,3.4438,1.5033,0.6132,4.8457,2.6819,0.5024,2.489,2.1858,3.7249,5.6085,0.6941,4.8375,2.7757,0.3441,2.047,1.0953,3.2099,2.7468,4.1257,0.6991,0.3609,1.4065,3.958,3.9768,5.979,0.0865,4.2017,0.0063,0.0654,2.7251,5.1897,3.7624,4.0473,2.4358,2.958,0.0009,5.7686,0.0627,0.4379,3.8797,1.9902,0.2589,5.93,3.697,0.9361,3.1401,3.9152,0.887,6.0917,5.0718,4.0342,3.3479,2.0835,4.704,1.1601,0.7086,0.0003,4.6474,3.3013,2.4166,1.6619,4.6306,4.875,5.0156,5.9377,2.654,3.8906,1.9546,5.2103,4.718,0.2483,0.0014,0.9485,3.6009,0.813,1.8372,3.1381,2.1922,2.6355,3.9054,5.1385,3.4788,3.4012,0.6727,1.6341,5.2509,3.2048,6.7475,0.6089,4.0752,1.4301,3.4082,1.1694,1.8589,5.756,3.8178,6.1977,3.801,1.6728,3.2628,4.2435,1.1228,3.1731,4.4554,0.0136,3.4644,0.9214,1.4787,1.2694,3.4704,3.0006,2.1331,3.6193,3.3852,3.9818,3.1422,3.9159,0.0018,3.8744,4.639,1.4396,0.7694,3.3174,2.3273,4.2603,2.4146,5.106,4.3018,5.4783,1.1239,5.7988,1.2814,4.6942,1.8506,3.5437,4.29,0.0908,0.0846,1.6267,1.4361,1.9526,3.9634,4.4266,5.6273,4.2436,0.8576,0.0129,0.1454,3.5791,2.8846,5.0612,0.0132,1.7771,1.5675,4.0582,4.5497,2.5298,0.1652,1.1877,0.0002,2.299,4.7882,1.8281,3.8413,2.1661,0.4694,2.3178,0.8547,5.0478,3.5167,5.2926,0.7891,4.4943,1.4205,5.2605,1.0082,6.0368,1.2205,0.9011,4.2238,1.3966,1.2328,4.5954,4.5335,0.2129,2.4675,0.6158,6.2839,1.6821,0.3707,3.9823,6.7843,2.9987,5.8712,0.1018,1.3761,6.246,2.5386,6.1323,7.5599,0.3103,0.5196,3.8533,5.8187,3.9402,6.0269,0.9795,1.1031,1.8097,2.1558,1.9197,5.7773,0.1422,4.6838,1.782,3.0655,1.5249,5.7465,0.8043,1.2524,0.0584,4.4252,0.947,0.7095,2.8982,1.9525,3.6303,0.0478,5.4115,3.6928,0.0005,1.4743,1.0476,1.1718,1.804,1.3494,5.1504,3.8884,1.3216,0.1932,1.0642,0.0003,2.3237,4.5094,5.1623,2.1683,3.3708,2.884,1.5408,3.4636,4.068,3.457,3.1089,2.9002,2.8634,1.7078,3.5482,3.0151,5.57,1.3201,1.7895,5.0389,6.4317,5.3424,0.0004,3.7644,2.4287,6.2781,0.9311,0.4264,1.3997,5.7874,2.5092,5.1115,2.7252,4.406,1.1799,5.9048,3.4721,0.8716,3.462,1.6003,5.8938,3.5289,0.3957,5.1326,0.6616,0.1342,0.5749,1.0165,0.6188,2.1455,4.6239,1.3137,2.7357,5.4357,1.4073,3.7512,2.0342,1.9121,0.0783,4.7893,1.6043,4.9592,2.4626,4.657,1.4324,2.8585,4.8013,1.3363,1.1869,5.9535,5.7901,1.4361,1.2618,4.1987,2.2709,2.3669,0.0596,2.1448,2.0692,0.5164,3.4426,6.4205,3.4259,1.4191,1.5332,2.6369,0.3115,0.7933,0.3881,0.737,2.1515,2.4166,3.0652,3.0016,4.3814,0.3362,4.27,1.8044,0.8963,0.0002,1.7878,2.3199,3.4976,6.172,5.3329,4.1896,3.0367,3.4348,5.144,4.8833,1.4844,2.6641,0.1173,3.0067,1.8963,0.94,2.8945,6.289,0.5167,3.1608,0.0574,4.8017,4.2969,1.9961,1.4918,5.2008,5.4467,1.0386,3.0057,0.0002,5.6574,4.6068,0.6091,0.79,2.9202,1.8399,0.3839,0.6971,0.3525,0.0002,2.0321,0.5636,6.0148,2.8889,3.4863,1.7863,0.5259,2.5975,3.6151,2.7398,4.605,4.1855,1.744,0.3083,0.5639,0.5325,3.6049,3.2129,3.4842,0.4182,1.3799,0.5455,2.8395,3.1784,5.6703,0.3735,1.4734,1.4655,2.5945,3.7344,5.2258,2.6803,2.3337,5.4347,0.9997,1.7956,0.6486,0.0938,0.8364,0.1938,0.1392,1.3536,0.0002,1.7902,0.6391,1.9747,1.5806,1.3186,5.1155,1.8244,5.1999,1.586,1.3995,4.8126,0.3187,3.0155,0.1712,2.1473,3.2117,2.1965,2.3442,0.7782,5.1654,1.2958,4.9798,0.1968,1.1434,1.3189,0.4157,0.9173,4.2564,2.6524,0.9573,5.4922,3.4936,0.3942,1.1133,0.6805,1.0799,0.2301,2.4142,1.7897,2.7263,2.0892,2.7285,2.3947,4.7104,3.6536,2.4903,1.0938,3.606,4.8177,1.5092,5.5199,0.1616,0.7674,3.4171,0.8145,0.2426,0.8113,2.1597,3.7942,1.5518,0.6822,4.1954,1.1821,0.8102,0.0002,11.7497,3.5846,0.0092,2.36,0.0142,0.0017,0.0011,0.0307,0.0168,3.8717,0.6028,1.4821,2.0667,0.0958,4.1021,0.186,0.1642,1.9106,1.544,2.1645,0.9107,0.1537,0.9631,4.6029,0.7909,0.2475,0.0584,0.7019,4.584,2.4798,0.2365,1.363,1.0631,2.3641,0.6445,1.6667,1.1399,3.4564,1.3106,3.571,1.1474,5.099,2.3545,0.1539,1.4276,4.5436,0.3879,0.5523,0.5643,1.1526,3.0528,5.5772,1.9511,0.2274,2.5673,1.952,5.0219,1.3622,4.1934,0.5078,0.341,1.282,2.2323,0.3293,4.4011,0.5872,4.6262,1.7481,3.7761,3.0132,3.9919,5.9197,1.7364,4.9089,2.9612,5.7727,0.9969,1.1417,1.1193,0.0002,5.4094,1.7732,2.1548,0.2757,0.2956,5.0972,0.7685,0.0929,2.0821,2.0304,0.8264,0.7485,3.8921,2.2143,4.3157,0.0025,1.5568,2.1518,4.5088,0.2773,7.1815,3.5647,0.2277,0.0716,3.9097,1.7971,3.2707,5.9197,0.2771,5.5564,2.2133,0.3

But most important, I am interested in Pakistan. The government has always seen me as a talented and beautiful young woman, who could play a role in the future.

{"id":1578,"ended":true,"length":670,"gen_text":"A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on June 25 and moved across the Atlantic Ocean and central Caribbean Sea with little development. Within the western Caribbean Sea, convection developed with strong wind over the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. Winds gust to 140 km\/h\n\nThe eastern Atlantic Ocean was warm enough for a jet stream across the Atlantic to break up the water ice, allowing a rapid expansion of the tropical storm. The storm formed over the Caribbean during May and June after coming ashore. The strongest winds ever recorded in the west were about 10 km\/h at 1:18pm, but no significant storms occurred during June or July. The western Caribbean was still warm enough for a jet stream across the Atlantic to break up the water ice, allowing a rapid expansion of the tropical storm.\n\nIn late 2014, a tropical storm with 20 to 25 m long lashed the East Atlantic coast with strong winds, with winds exceeding 120 km\/h. The Hurricane had the largest storm intensity and occurred between 10-12 m wide, and there were 15 to 20 localities where winds exceeded 180 km\/h.\n\nIn September 2014, wind speeds were measured in the Southern Ocean and on the West Coast from the western coast of the United States to the southwestern American coast from California. Hurricane Sandy recorded a strong wind gust of 40 km\/h near the southwestern horizon, which was the strongest in the National Weather Service's Tropical Storm Season (TTS).\n\nFigure 3 The strong wind at 8.10pm on June 25 of 2014 at El Capitan, Florida, following a high tide line, measured near the eastern direction of the hurricane. The storm has a length of 0.8 km\n\nThis large storm was the third strongest hurricane to strike the US in 14 years, after 2005 Hurricane Katrina, 2010 Hurricane Ike, 2011 Ulysses, 2012 Olympe, 2013 Irene, and 2011 St. Lawrence, where an extremely strong wind from Hurricane Matthew occurred at the central coast.\n\nWind over the Atlantic Ocean during July\n\nMost hurricane season, Atlantic hurricanes show very strong gusts of up to 45 km\/h. However, the strongest wind at 8.10pm on June 25 of 2014 caused the strongest offshore wind gusts of over 100 km\/h recorded. The storm has a length of 0.2 km. The hurricane has a duration of 6 seconds.\n\nWind speed in the Southern Ocean over June 25 of 2014\n\nThe maximum wind speed of the Hurricane is estimated to be over 1000 kmh. As a result, the storm, which is usually strong near the west coast of this nation, can be seen on September 29.\n\nThe storm is on track toward Florida and the Central Florida coast\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season has only one Atlantic landfall date. During all of August, September, and January (when there was much activity in the Gulf of Mexico region), the storm continues to spread through most of the United States, with the strongest wind from July through May. After a record high wind gust of 60 km\/h near Puerto Rico, the storm has a duration of 6 seconds.\n\nThe strongest storm event to have developed near the Atlantic (including two in October) was Hurricane Andrew (also known as the Hurricane of the Month). The most powerful wind on the Caribbean at 8.10 pm on July 25 of 1944 (the date of the biggest storm to enter New York alone) caused the strongest storm in the Atlantic's history, with winds of 140 km\/h. The storm moved to Florida on August 17, 2014, carrying winds of 130 km\/h (about 11 miles away from the coastline of Puerto

{"id":2404,"ended":true,"length":721,"gen_text":"Day @ - @ Lewis played Abraham Lincoln in Steven Spielberg's film Lincoln ( 2012 ). Based on the book Team of Rivals : The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, the film marks the 20th century in the way that anti-imperialists view the US military-industrial complex and its role in American society. During the Cold War, the militarization of NATO, its failure to protect the nuclear core, and its military involvement began to be called for. During the 2016 presidential campaign, US President Donald Trump called on the military-industrial complex to \"take action on these issues.\" In his meeting with US President Donald Trump, it was revealed that Trump is not alone in calling for US Military Intervention on North Korean missile and nuclear threats since 1990. In a video posted online, President Trump stated that: \"I'm going to do a lot more to stop North Korea than anything else, really, because this was an issue that was going to change our lives from what it was about. We will rebuild it, and there's so much more we can do to stop it, so I'm very positive about it.\"\"While Trump may be the most prolific and well-regarded president on the planet, some observers claim that Trump's stance on the American military-industrial complex is very different from President Obama's in the case of Israel. When asked by The Hollywood Reporter ( January 31, 2017 ) what he would like the US to focus on, President Trump responded: \"One of the reasons we're going to focus on Israel is because we've been given a lot of bad information about American forces fighting in that country. What we have to do will only be a little more focused on the bad information that comes from the inside and from the outside. We're going to focus on what makes this country great, and I'm trying to do everything I possibly can to get better information.\"During his election campaign, Trump repeatedly stated that he would build a wall along the US-Mexico border for American citizens living in the US illegally. In July 2017, the White House said that he would build it as part of his campaign, but the fact of the matter is that Trump had no way of knowing until after Election Day. According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump's decision was seen as an effort by his aides to deflect questions concerning his immigration stances. He said he would build a border wall only after meeting with President Barack Obama at the Oval Office. He has said that Mexico will pay for the wall and that he would build more than 1,500 miles of fencing along the southern, Central American country to ensure that American Muslims do not attack the country.Earlier this September, Trump said he would build a wall along the US-Mexico border, while also stating that he would bring \"some bad guys over\" to control all of the Mexican population. In January 2017, the State Department published a list of seven countries it thinks should not be considered for entry into the US by the United States; only Germany, France, Russia, and Canada will be considered in our admission criteria.\"Many of these seven countries have very low natural security needs, don't have many opportunities to develop their own technology, and are very unstable and difficult to deal with. Mexico is particularly hard on these countries,\" said Steven R.

{"id":1267,"ended":false,"length":652,"gen_text":"USS Winslow ( Destroyer No. 53 \/ DD @ - @ 53 ) was laid down by William Cramp and Sons of Philadelphia in October 1913 and launched in February 1915. The ship was sunk in October 1917 in the Atlantic Ocean by unknown means. During the war, William Cramp's brother Rolf Cramp also attempted to destroy the ship, and the Rolf Cramp family made sure the ship's life support system was fully operational. William Cramp later retired after serving six tours of duty.\n\nThe ship was commissioned in 1915 and built in 1913. However, it was forced to leave the U.S. for Russia in 1924 with the sinking of its mother. In the following years, Cramp was on a number of commercial tours to Europe with F. A. H. Hyneman, Edward H. Luthner, and J. E. R. White, which was successful with little damage to the ship. The ship had also been commissioned as a shipbreaker by William D. Scott, and there are rumors that Scott's son, who headed the Navy's naval operations program, was also part of the Cramp family. The ship went to the Spanish-American War as the ship was a direct replacement for the Lances 2 destroyer when it was commissioned in 1937. On August 8, 1941, the destroyer's starboard side starboard bulkhead was destroyed and became the Lances 2. However, despite the fact that the war was over and the Lances 2 were already on their way to attack Pearl Harbor in time to put a stop to the Japanese American forces fighting in that direction, it was the same for William Cramp and Hyneman when the ship was commissioned in 1942. In January 1943, the destroyer was retired from service. When the ship arrived for the war in 1945 at U.S. Naval Base at Yokosuka in Japan, the ship's superstructure was replaced by an extremely large piece of furniture, similar to that on many American warships. It stayed there until the battle of Okinawa. There, the USS Brest was actually the last combat aircraft carrier to ship for the war.\n\nIn 1960, William, Rolf Cramp, Edward and J. E. R. White were awarded the B.A. in History from the Pacific Maritime University in Tokyo, and both William Cramp and his brother Robert were chosen by Presidents of the South Korea Independence Republic and the South Korea People's Republics Korea after it was established as a free country after the war. Robert Cramp died on May 14, 1988, and Rolf Cramp returned to work for the U.S. Navy on September 29, 1988. William William Cramp was also awarded a B.A. degree from the Harvard School of Law in 1964. William William Cramp joined F. A. H. Hyneman's Naval History Program in 1970 and studied law for one year during the program before returning to his fishing career. In 1975 the ship was renamed to the S.S. Hyneman in memory of the captain.\n\nIn 1982 William William Cramp served in the U.S. Navy as an Air Force Ranger at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, then in 2002 his father, Robert Cramp, was discharged from the Air Force after 10 years as a \"non-combatant\" and he was in a wheelchair.\n\nIn 1985 William William William Cramp wrote a poem in order to commemorate the time that he was born.

{"id":2151,"ended":false,"length":729,"gen_text":"Due to their great distance from the Earth, all stars except the Sun appear to the unaided eye as shining points in the night sky that twinkle because of the effect of the Earth's magnetic field. These are the true colours of the sky. The magnetic fields, like all other objects with motion, have a great influence across the sky.\nAn observation in the late 1940s could be described as using an array of two objects within the Milky Way constellation. One group of stars is located in the constellation Pisces, and the other is located at the intersection of the equator and North America. But these objects are invisible. The Earth's magnetic field has no effect on these stars. This fact allows astronomers to find out for certain where the stars originate, with an amazing number of stars which are very bright or are at least brighter than us, making the search extremely easy.\nWith the help of some friends in Canada and several other countries, I found the largest, brightest and largest star cluster known to science, the Andromeda Galaxy. The Milky Way has five light years of light so it has the closest stars.\nWhile there may be some difference in the light from which the stars originate, not every star is just a few miles away. Each has its own shape (small stars, for example). The most striking star cluster is the Sun, which is also located so close to the Sun that it is easy to see. This is why we call it the \"star cluster\". This is the star cluster due to the sun's magnetic field in the sky, which can then be viewed in the infrared. The sky will now be filled with many different groups of stars, including Andromeda, the very faint remnants of the early galaxies and galaxies. The light is scattered from each star so it makes up for the long distance between each group of stars, which is where the true stars originate from. I have never seen this before, where any distant star cluster from Earth is seen.\nI have found the most likely location of the Sun during our time. There is one region in the Milky Way that lies above the center of any other star cluster. I believe this place lies at the south of the Milky Way at about 1,700 miles from Saturn. This region lies a little too close to the Sun.\nThe Moon has a massive mass and the Milky Way galaxy is just around the sun's center. The Moon is at about 2,826 miles, the closest we have to the Sun. I thought this would be the star cluster because I observed a little area with quite an intense effect. I also noticed a little amount of faint white smoke that was similar to the faint white light that they found on the moon when looking at the light from Earth. I called it the \"flue lighting\".\nThe stars all converge at a circle or circle of about 4 miles or more. The circles give off bright colours which help us to determine where these stars are located. The stars vary in sizes, color and brightness. They may be in a light source or there may be the effects of Earth's magnetic field. These may be the source of the intense star cluster called the light from the Earth. There may be two or more stars at the center of the Milky Way, making it one of the most intense star clusters on the planet.\nIn the future when I am unable to pick up speed with the clock, I plan to create a photo series in which I will show each star cluster I am interested in.

{"id":3977,"ended":false,"length":703,"gen_text":"During his Senate campaign, Butler spoke out forcefully about the veterans bonus. Veterans of World War I, many of whom had been out of work since the beginning of the Great Depression, would go to the Army for training to serve in the United States Army and to join private industry. In 1942 he would spend 13 years in the Army.\n\nHe also spoke out about a war that he believed would have brought millions of Indians out of poverty. He supported the War Measures and advocated the establishment of a National Council, a joint federal task force where he wanted to coordinate and support efforts to save the Indian Indians from starvation and persecution. The President called him a leader in restoring the right of Indians to have a fair trial on civil and military charges.\n\nHe was one of the first Americans to lead a commission to draft Indian children and found fault with the current system of government. He suggested that the Government should use Native Americans as its \"pre-eminent resource\" and help them build their own settlements. It was never an option.\n\nButler's nomination to the Supreme Court during the second world war also showed he held a strong loyalty to the Constitution as well. He was the first to have a second term of office when the term was ended by President Woodrow Wilson in 1937.\n\nIn 1944, one year before Butler, he was also the last African American to serve in the Supreme Court.\n\nAfter his death, Butler was the recipient of a bronze statue of the late Supreme Court Justice Justice H. G. Wells. When he was finally confirmed as Supreme Court Justice of the Supreme Court in 1956, it was for a bronze sculpture of H.G. Wells that he first stood before the Senate and gave a standing ovation.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Martha, and four grandchildren, a daughter, Susan, and a son, Clarence.\n\nHis son is named in the American Historical Association's Heritage Articles. He is preceded by his wife, Barbara, daughter, Martha. The surviving members of the American Historical Association can be contacted at: arthur.nemassociation@ar.net.\n\nHis widow, Patricia, lives in Detroit and wrote:\n\n\"I would like to express the deepest condolences to her family. The work of the Court has been done and its actions are no longer needed. Their honor is one of the things I remember most about Senator Butler. Thank you, Mrs. Butler, and thank you to your Congressmen for making sure that Congress had the support she gave her son who, like most American citizens, had a right not only to make a decision that would impact the lives of her brothers and sisters on this continent, but to provide more education to the grandchildren whose futures lie in this country.\n\n\"It all began with a conversation Senator Butler had with my father and his staff in the early 1900s, which lasted for several months before he was forced to leave the court to take a new post in the Civil War and found time to reflect and understand. He did the same by helping to write the law he served in the court for 33 years. It was his time to leave, and he could not have put such great effort into the civil case, let alone the trial, that had been in which he was charged with leading the nation in the trial of a criminal man on charges of treason for making a false statement.

{"id":481,"ended":true,"length":705,"gen_text":"In 2002, Beyonc\u00e9 signed a contract with Pepsi, and appeared on several of its advertising campaigns, one of which featured `` Crazy in Love `` as background music. After winning the Pepsi's advertising campaign in the year 2000, Beyonc\u00e9 began to earn money by making songs in other countries. In 2008, she paid Pepsi $12.5 million to produce several ``Badger Heads\ufffd music videos using Pepsi's brand. In 2009, she said of her deal: `` If I make any movie, I will make a movie about me and Pepsi. No matter what, it's okay. It's okay.''In 2011, she was forced to cancel her tour with Tupac and the group, citing a dispute on health care. A week into the second season, Beyonc\u00e9 tweeted: `` If you want your money back, go make a movie that shows what you did the first time, and what you did the second time.'' Beyonc\u00e9 then began to make some other movies and appeared on many Pepsi commercials.In 2011, she wrote a new song, which she released on her website titled `` The Love Me.`` '' This song, based on a line from Tupac's song ``Bubble on a Rock Bottom'' (\"P.O. Box,'' 2004), is an homage to Tupac's song \"The Love Me`` and her song, which was written by Tupac. While there are other songs in the song where she sings similar lyrics, she has never made a song that is particularly popular. The same song has no lyrics or lyrics at all that Tupac would find offensive or objectionable. While Tupac was often controversial for his lyrics, and he did use Tupac very sparingly, he also wrote and appeared in the movies, commercials, on television and in music videos. On one occasion, at the beginning of the film, in the music video for`` I am a Rock Rock Woman (The Beatles,'' the title track from Shakira ), Tupac called for American troops to be sent to Afghanistan. The Beatles singer, who had previously said that he was tired of the Bush regime, was also asked why he would not go to Afghanistan; Tupac said not even the American troops were given a chance to meet with the Afghan population. In a subsequent interview Tupac said that the Taliban, who had been fighting him for almost 20 years were just waiting for him to tell them who he was. He also said that he wanted to stop the war after 10 years. His son, who died five years ago of lung cancer, was killed by the Afghan, and he was told by a doctor that his family was to be killed. However, the Taliban said that it was not that big of a deal so they could simply come back later and have the American troops take a look at the movie.As of 2010, Pepsi (not E.W.) had not disclosed its pay-out for \" The Love Me'', nor was E.W. ever involved in a new movie that was about Tupac's record production schedule and production costs. E.W. was one of the producers for Tupac's 1993 track of ``The Love Me.'' In 1994, E.W. became a huge commercial star and Pepsi sponsored his 1997 film, ``I'll Survive the World of God.''

{"id":659,"ended":true,"length":684,"gen_text":"Rowley, stationed at Saint @ - @ Paul to the west of Saint @ - @ Denis, received word that Africaine had arrived at Saint Denis and immediately sought to drive off the enemy forces in the direction of the fort @ C'est au Cour de Bordeaux-Marne, according to the statement. On Nov 15 the French, armed to the teeth, charged a group of German tanks with an artillery-caliber machine gun and four infantry divisions with them after finding and killing the French.\n\nThe announcement on the night of November 30 is believed to have been made by Africaine leader Pierre Le V\u00e9ron, who was accompanied with two other French officers who were present at the Battle of Saint Denis on the morning of November 30.\n\nCatherine was the youngest of three siblings who is the daughter of the late Bishop of Orleans, who was the son of his paternal grandfather, Thomas Le V\u00e9ron (1640-1712). His parents, who were members of the Roman Catholic family, were well-heeled and well-versed in French, so some of the other family connections were in good hands, the statement said.\n\nThe statement added that the German artillery batteries had attacked the fort from the north, where they had been firing on an enemy force. On the other side of the river near the fort, they also attacked two French positions with the artillery.\n\nThe report said that France had been \"committed\" by the Parisian military to fight the invading forces of Africaine in the North Atlantic. They could provide the German forces with artillery support while they remained in the North. By doing so, France and Cameroon had \"remained very comfortable in France after the battle went down.\" The German forces had not been notified so their forces had been \"moved from the offensive immediately,\" the statement said.\n\nThe report added that when the reinforcements arrived at the Fort @ Paul they were surprised to see a huge column of infantry fighting through the center of the field. After several thousand men, it was discovered that one of the French was dead, and that an artillery-caliber cannon was exploding in the center of the field. He had run from one of the French defenders on the hill.\n\nThe report was based on information from sources that were informed as early as November 18.\n\n\"This is a major breakthrough in modern warfare and the final test for Belgian and French military courage and valor,\" said Paul De Sousa, French Forces Commander of the 24th Brigade. \"No other military unit has ever reached this location in the history of the Continent and in France itself. The French must become masters of their own destiny as they set out on a mission of liberation, to take our army down to the woods and to a safe place, all of these things together. We must also have the utmost courage to show our strength at this critical moment in history.\"\n\nFrancois Bertion, France's Vice-President of Communications, said today in a press conference that France's forces were in the midst of a campaign to win back territory under attack, after their last move in the south was to retook Saint Bernard, a town at the southern end of the province where the Red Army moved in to defeat the Germans.

{"id":4116,"ended":false,"length":697,"gen_text":"Robbie Daw of Idolator appreciated the plot twist of the video, commenting, `` We really expected Nicki to waste that other warrior @ - @ in @ - @ training hater. The next time i see that sis is doing that kind of thing, he should be shot because he's a ninja. I'm also wondering how she has the 'wisdom' to work it out with her teammates but she seems like she does not really know how to deal with them after coming back from the ocean.\n\nIt is a very odd plot twist where he is able to take out her but loses his mind after this, the fact that it will have two endings is not mentioned.\n\nI don't know why Nicki is looking for revenge, but it would be nice to see what she thinks of her teammates now.\n\nAs a side note...\n\nIt has been said that her love for this little nag is so strong she would really wish she could take a big step back from the real, and there is so much drama surrounding her actions.\n\nand so much of the other female characters in the video.. I couldn't help but laugh at how sad she was for not having some kind of real relationship with her teammates.\n\nTo me, there was no real sense of romance in this series even after the movie, this was also the last time Nicki was around her fellow ninja.\n\nAfter watching the storyboard, the character concept and the video is very clear, especially where the other ninja (the two main ones) are at the game. As the game develops, it will look more and more like a team-based game. And when the games get in front of my eyes and I can't help but think, what if a team makes up for the fact that I'm the one who can run amok, or what if I simply don't have enough speed to beat the enemies? And that's what this game is about; fighting through the obstacles and fighting through the demons of each game. There is little mystery or suspense when you are going through this, but you know what could be possible?\n\nI want to see how she reacts when she starts to die, the way that she uses her fire and her aura to fight. The game is about as fast as you possibly can get, but there were a lot of moments where I could tell that Nicki isn't the most intelligent ninja on the world's most famous city.\n\n. The characters are more than just cute. They represent the world with characters, and are very strong.\n\nFor people who are looking for an exciting and realistic story.\n\nI think it is worth mentioning that Nanna has more time to grow with each day. The only time that they lose their sense of adventure is when she goes to prison.\n\n...and yet, after Nicki wakes up one day (if her mind was right) she immediately becomes a very powerful ninja, with an incredible aura - and a whole new way of living.\n\nFor a more realistic, action-packed, high-speed action game of this magnitude, Nicki will have to compete for a lot of things in the beginning and end of the game, such as making it into the next level of her gameplay.\n\nIf you see anything that isn't already hinted at (or hasn't been hinted at yet) please share it in the comment section.\n\n(Also, I am really excited to see how she develops her ninja self. I mean, she looks like she could have some fun but her ninja skills don't really do anything for her as far as my analysis are concerned.)","token_len":748,"entropy":[9.2412,9.6568,6.4397,12.4096,5.5542,11.8165,0.8984,9.1498,3.6019,2.8685,1.2726,5.6766,1.3665,7.029,0.9704,9.4153,8.6695,3.5241,7.1194,8.2377,3.9204,1.577,8.4318,5.1819,8.1076,10.7472,13.43,8.8458,5.3336,7.5396,11.5145,3.0462,2.7042,6.5478,9.2552,5.3008,2.1985,3.4685,5.5916,1.8961,5.3302,1.0643,3.7564,6.03,2.3305,4.3245,4.0018,2.2511,5.2398,0.0069,1.0598,1.0005,3.1674,2.4327,1.3011,5.5876,4.9837,0.9534,1.1738,1.8089,5.0929,1.4608,2.7104,2.1786,5.2611,3.9481,2.1774,3.5761,4.6355,2.493,5.3835,5.1272,1.4937,0.659,0.2499,5.4144,4.4763,0.3936,1.9291,1.9983,3.5228,5.3286,2.2641,3.4987,1.7721,0.8251,3.7784,2.9679,4.1836,1.3187,0.7464,0.1409,2.9843,0.0117,3.945,5.4157,5.9061,1.2568,0.4426,1.6111,6.2366,0.9678,4.6313,0.0244,5.0173,2.7944,2.7219,3.385,4.623,5.8871,0.2833,4.9463,4.3016,1.589,4.133,0.0073,3.7646,2.1543,3.8512,5.2617,5.4343,1.873,2.3263,2.4351,4.7348,2.6031,4.0174,3.8582,0.1664,3.5098,4.4359,3.458,4.9343,3.934,2.1473,3.4688,4.5519,1.0094,1.5161,0.0002,3.7045,3.1082,0.0021,1.2485,2.7304,3.2339,0.1628,1.9553,5.7537,1.6263,1.9384,1.825,1.5433,2.0605,2.9252,0.9888,1.767,0.9045,0.536,4.0038,1.888,2.957,0.8652,2.0263,2.4123,5.2457,1.2051,0.9325,0.0002,4.7978,2.7061,3.0148,0.0747,4.42,2.0211,0.0002,3.9535,3.4912,0.3387,2.5049,0.3216,4.6529,5.572,1.3119,5.7369,6.0987,6.1578,2.0713,1.5402,2.9042,1.0924,2.4864,2.8591,5.6124,5.1691,1.626,0.7237,3.6012,2.5026,5.0061,2.0411,1.046,1.5969,2.1375,5.023,6.0052,3.4521,5.1454,0.8311,4.0931,0.0997,4.7889,3.1023,0.9148,4.2978,1.4133,1.0607,0.0003,7.0961,4.3465,1.7727,3.3251,2.1886,3.6719,5.0535,0.6745,2.145,0.7598,0.8417,6.4089,3.9206,5.7207,0.0011,1.3843,0.0868,4.2231,1.3371,1.7126,4.0261,1.7489,1.6442,2.5164,3.0124,2.6857,4.4953,2.0336,0.0222,4.601,3.1958,0.1817,0.95,2.4548,0.7581,0.6029,0.0002,5.6987,3.3975,0.5866,4.0758,2.2783,2.2317,3.5233,3.0625,0.5382,3.0042,1.9349,1.2034,4.8154,6.1305,2.71,1.7145,5.4133,2.4139,4.6349,1.7402,5.6597,1.8318,3.4279,1.0096,3.3386,0.0172,1.5848,3.9749,2.0478,6.0229,2.1806,1.6337,0.8346,0.0003,5.6534,2.3379,0.8829,5.6105,5.9979,1.0455,3.8284,4.6949,4.8968,2.5634,1.3079,4.9565,3.3759,2.0527,2.929,1.8251,4.2738,5.1996,1.7439,4.7161,3.34,4.375,3.3428,4.163,3.6049,1.3798,0.6669,0.7349,3.4509,1.1335,5.79,1.0415,4.8256,2.6744,2.1554,4.4865,0.6273,1.8387,2.9941,4.6176,1.8434,0.5871,0.0008,0.2024,1.183,4.437,2.9202,1.2294,1.2461,1.1738,4.6093,3.9169,1.6983,5.3568,3.0264,3.9428,5.3428,0.0155,4.3696,0.2117,2.719,0.9893,3.057,1.7899,1.1473,0.1279,1.7092,1.5418,2.645,3.2145,4.1496,1.7743,6.1129,2.7661,1.8867,1.7898,2.7627,0.1145,3.2286,1.8919,3.4578,1.2813,1.0202,3.6326,5.5239,4.8999,0.0424,2.5542,2.3194,4.005,0.0578,1.5771,6.1853,2.8262,0.0008,1.0883,2.9289,4.8424,0.6081,4.3379,1.4981,3.754,1.1889,3.7303,2.9379,0.9214,2.3497,2.6458,1.7431,0.7996,1.6045,4.8378,3.0324,4.5216,1.8575,5.3579,1.497,3.0958,2.6559,0.8931,5.8052,3.641,5.649,2.9817,0.6728,4.3983,0.9317,5.3648,4.5567,2.8418,2.8646,3.2125,1.8857,2.8986,5.0792,0.5699,2.0324,2.6528,2.0216,3.0195,2.7194,1.2396,6.22,1.3473,5.7659,1.3487,1.2562,0.0003,2.1033,4.8208,0.2024,2.683,2.3186,3.4587,1.7358,1.8344,0.8231,5.0698,1.3287,5.167,1.357,4.0907,2.4214,3.0753,0.4081,4.9337,0.515,5.722,2.7656,1.5724,5.3411,0.4982,2.7181,2.4268,3.0232,3.841,1.7347,3.1685,4.9552,5.3639,0.5901,1.8211,6.167,0.0617,2.0193,1.7054,2.0454,2.8319,4.7438,2.0753,1.0351,0.03,2.7397,0.4779,1.1143,2.9054,3.3361,1.3065,3.4399,0.0104,5.4186,0.0006,3.0035,2.8198,4.4613,0.7391,3.6876,0.4347,4.6133,5.1281,1.6165,2.1915,4.7791,0.8244,1.2396,0.0003,7.7129,5.7062,4.6635,1.3758,4.7299,2.7187,1.3159,3.5065,1.6317,1.6249,5.9424,1.2096,3.6998,4.8281,4.2652,3.1418,1.6655,4.0723,2.7499,3.539,1.0516,1.614,0.0003,5.0753,5.3667,0.4436,1.924,2.5927,0.2969,2.9525,4.7585,2.1375,3.9499,3.0879,5.5366,1.8161,0.0004,2.285,2.8516,1.9292,1.3214,4.146,2.777,0.324,6.0693,5.5754,3.3376,4.8234,4.6397,1.6017,3.3712,3.207,1.8644,3.9021,1.473,3.308,4.3783,2.7176,2.4814,5.1909,5.7558,1.916,3.2189,0.0231,5.6373,0.5723,0.3541,1.3665,3.3658,1.5305,6.1576,0.9201,1.1698,0.0003,4.775,2.0556,5.0567,1.2591,4.6236,4.7535,0.0095,4.9085,0.0328,5.444,0.2561,4.6436,5.4147,4.6086,4.7052,3.0205,3.9588,0.922,0.5591,5.1067,2.7563,1.4902,3.8074,2.9653,0.4277,1.9496,3.8177,3.3397,2.4741,5.6071,6.6867,2.2164,2.0282,4.401,1.5121,2.7394,0.575,3.8499,0.5505,0.7586,0.0003,4.9302,2.9806,3.7469,1.2724,2.6463,2.3876,0.4548,0.3263,2.0336,5.4034,0.2432,2.7163,1.3071,0.7657,5.2468,1.3244,2.809,0.2528,4.0174,0.0094,2.8633,1.6849,0.3256,4.6785,1.7873,2.4906,1.7516,0.1259,3.7349,2.1769,1.4441,5.5106,2.6755,1.3774,0.5713,0.3116,0.4373,1.3881,3.6738,0.0056,5.2819,3.3064,3.4171,0.9079,2.4799,1.3125,2.4468,2.2043,5.3412,0.5793,0.7063,0.0003,3.5939,1.0097,5.6572,4.472,1.5585,3.5193,0.0007,3.7857,4.7194,0.3317,3.8819,2.2442,5.976,0.0002,0.4822,2.1271,0.1484,0.9648,1.467,1.9741,2.7709,0.4785,1.4156,0.0374,1.9252,0.1394,1.4439,0.8907,0.0004,3.9637,4.1849,0.5054,2.0661,3.0847,3.2731,2.3,0.692,0.3393,1.3763,2.5624,2.7434,2.9947,4.077,5.7862,2.4877,1.4252,3.7641,0.2651,1

{"id":3176,"ended":true,"length":715,"gen_text":"Duchovny cast several of The X @ - @ Files'technical crew members in the episode. Tina M. < unk >, the show's actual craft services woman, portrayed Tina, and played her daughter, in the episode's teaser. But the show's writers, David Andrani and Andrew Bynum, were able to make the whole situation a lot more interesting by playing as both Tina's children and her mom.\nWith this storyline being developed, it wasn't difficult to figure out why all three characters were so closely related, and where they fit within that relationship. The cast members also made for interesting conversations that have been ongoing for some time, which was one thing that the show could have done better on.\nWith these stories, the second season will hopefully give fans of The X @ - @ Files more than just what they're looking forward to exploring in the upcoming episodes.\nOne of the things I'm sure fans can do when seeing the first season is to think about what will be left of the cast that's already here and beyond.\nWhile filming, things got out of control, and it's good to see the cast in this position as well. A lot of what worked on The X @ - @ Files was really meant to be, but there were still a lot of details where they didn't feel cohesive enough, like, which crewmember's name was the lead singer or what songs the characters had been playing, etc. These don't happen on the show, and we haven't been able to sort of confirm anyone's actual names that are out there, either.\nThe characters will now be in one episode.\nIt won't be long before the series will premiere, and The X @ - @ Files would feel right at home in a new home in this \"new\" time at the TV studio. It's a very long season, and I don't think The X @ - @ Files fans are going to be looking to see them on television anytime soon. I'm sure there will be other projects that will follow, but none of these projects are going to be seen by any other audience. Whether or not this show's characters, or not, will look at shows they want to see on television is another story. What I like about The X @ - @ Files, though, is that its creators, David Andrani and Andrew Bynum, kept their focus for a while, focused just a little bit now where they thought about their next projects. The characters they liked first of all, though, are going to eventually, and I think that it gives new meaning for this series to begin.\nI want The X @ - @ Files to always be good, and I want more, to do our best. One of my favorite things about this show, for me, is that when we show these characters on big screen, it's not just one show; it's several. A lot of shows are starting a new show every week, and that's kind of what This American Life brought to our attention.\nFor me, The X @ - @ Files has been an amazing show to look back on with some of my favorite moments from the series, and in terms of just exploring the story's most important questions, it's been a fantastic experience to explore new possibilities and mysteries that we never imagined existed in a show like this -- and hopefully for you, for all of your fans, I will be able to share those stories next year with you as they're presented on TV. You'll see more of our ideas in the coming episodes.\u00a0\nPosted by James ( @James_Cannon_ ) at 5:47

{"id":3089,"ended":true,"length":668,"gen_text":"Principal photography began on 23 April 2012, with the filming of `` Who R U? `` featuring Mahesh and Aggarwal supervised by Prem Rakshith on a set at Annapurna Studios in Hyderabad.\n\nMahesh has been known to shoot in Pakistan since the age of 16; his daughter Nitya has also been photographed in Pakistan.\n\nMahesh's production work began as part of the ''Bharat-era\" of Hindu cinema during the time before his arrival and is credited to him.\n\nMahesh's original feature film '' Bombay is Dead and it contains three films in four frames.'' The first being The Vindick-Fenimore of India and the second being India Goes North on a Train. A second is the second adaptation of the first, published in India in 1975, by Madhav Tharoor. The third is another adaptation, published by Harinwares Ltd., India in 1983. The fourth is the adaptation, released in 1984, by Bahujan Samaj Party in Hyderabad. Other remakes are released by Madhyane Productions.\n\nAs a part of his '' A India in Motion,'' which is a three-part film on a set, Mahesh shot three days in a row (including an entire day on a Sunday where the weather is cold. When the weather gets hot the set can be opened only by the crew, who do not stay till the following Monday). Mahesh said: '' I am really happy I got the opportunity to film in this world because it is such an exciting place, and I don't think even now, when you come out at night, you feel like you are out in it, because you have travelled and seen the amazing world.'\n\nThe second, '' Pasha I T T Y M U T P H A'in the form of the Bombay I T ', was shot on the opening day of the '' Bombay movie.'' The film was shot for the first time by a cast of two members of the cast (Dharmaravathi, Mahatma Gandhi, Abhinav Gandhi), who were originally shot on the day of their arrival in India on a train. The film featured the opening of the new office building and was seen with the audience during India's first national campaign, called the Indian Day of Independence. The day included the birth of several sons who became part of the community living in the new office building. Mahesh said: '' I really want to go to film in this world because there are so many things, so many people, some of them are not yet in the film. They were born by the Indian army and they were on that train when they came up from school to go to work.''' Mahesh wanted to film the day for a short time in India, not because it is big news, but because ''A India in Motion'' is the most realistic-looking of his own films, with the best lighting, best script and no special effects in a way no other Hindi film in the history of India has been done. He has also spent much of his career in the United States, where he was originally a director and then in England his film career began with an acting career.\n\nAt the beginning of 2008 he produced \"The Art of Dressing and Dressing'' directed by James Harkins (India Day of Remembrance) and directed by Sir Rajiv Mahajan (Ender I am).

{"id":4603,"ended":false,"length":678,"gen_text":"When the 6th Division was formed in October 1939, Sir Thomas Blamey appointed Rowell as its GSO1 ( chief of staff ). Rowell joined the Second Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) and served in command for over 100 years. Rowell was appointed to the Royal Naval Police Department in 1939. In 1942 he was chosen commander of the Second Australian Colonial Force ( AIP ) while he served as the director of operations on the Second Australian Air Force. Rowell retired from naval duty and had a daughter, Margaret.\n\nIn 1963 Rowell was commissioned with the 3rd Australian Regiment ( AIF ); his appointment was recognised by the Australian Army Command. On 6 December 1967 Rowell was posted to St George's Barracks on St Charles's Island where he served as Chief of Staff. Rowell later worked for the Royal Navy. His military career was marred by numerous injuries to the head and neck which left some with facial injuries and several died. He lived in the Bay of Biscay where he often visited family, friend and neighbours. Rowell also had five children who have been living in his community for three years now. This may be the oldest in any of the four generations to receive the RSPCA's prestigious military award from the Royal Defence Service in 1953.\n\nRowell served in South Australia where he served through the first 10 months of the 1960s (during which time he became known as 'Captain Rowell'). He was an officer in RAAF and an instructor in the RAAF's Training School for Aircraft Engineers in Brisbane. When he returned to the RAF he had a series of training experiences. During the 1962-64 season, he trained under the direction of the RAF's Joint Task Force in Brisbane and conducted training by taking part in regular air exercises and field exercises in the RAF's Royal Flying Corps. One of the first engagements in the RAF's Royal Flying Corps was a training exercise with the Royal Flying Corps's Army Air Corps.\n\nBefore joining the RAAF, Rowell participated in the Second Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ), the second of its three regiments, as well as during the first two days of the First Australian Defence Force, which was held on 25 September 1939. Two days before the start of the third Australian Defence Force on 8 June 1939, a German airship carrying a number of aircraft, including helicopters, were shot down by French artillery near the Australian-held territory of La Rochelle. Rowell suffered severe severe injuries to the head and neck. The Royal Air Force ordered him to be transported by British military transport aircraft, although he arrived safely at St George's Barracks in Canberra on 1 July 1939 and then returned on 1 July 1941.\n\nAs a child, Rowell played piano and sang for the local choir. Rowell was a member of all three Royal Military units (AAF, RAF and Dornier aircrews) at St George's in Sydney\n\nAt the age of 11 he had a child with his mother, Margaret, and a child with his grandmother, Mary, who were in the First Australian Imperial Force.\n\nAfter his illness he married a small girl, Mrs Fodley. The couple returned to Sydney on 31 February 1939 and married in 1951.

{"id":4803,"ended":false,"length":656,"gen_text":"The Dominicans established themselves in Xocolo on the shore of Lake Izabal in the mid @ - @ 16th century. Xocolo became infamous among the Dominican missionaries for the practice of witchcraft by its followers and its own inhabitants in the year 1410.[4] During the year, Xocolo was also known as the \"Tidelands.\"\n\nXocolo's territory included the capital of the Spanish kingdom of Palaus, which is now part of the United States. During the sixteenth century, Xocolo was also a center of trade and political relations between Spanish and Latin American nations.[5] It was known as the \"Tidelands,\" since it was believed that Xocolo had been the home planet for various tribes and tribes since at least the thirteenth century.\n\nIn 1413, Xocolo's king was sent to Portugal to study a manuscript on the origins of the English religion. After an account by a member of Xocolo's council, the manuscript was burned. As part of his research, however, Xocolo's son tried to recover some of the key letters of a manuscript written by Xiamenga. Later on, when the church was founded, some of the letters of the manuscript were burned down and burned by members of Xocolo's council.[6] Some of the writings in the manuscript were also altered so as to resemble the original text.[7]\n\nAfter their death, Xocolo established an empire on the planet Casalpa on the eastern coast of Lake Izabal. When Xocolo established as its capital, Casalpa became one of the main colonies for various groups of Spanish colonists. At that time, the first major Spanish colonial office in Casalpa was established in 1413. When their son succeeded his father as king, his empire fell into ruins. According to Xocolo's own account, Casalpa became the first colony in Latin America to establish an independence party.\n\nXocolo's conquest over the Dominican Republic during the same year lasted for nearly three decades with the addition of the Dominicans, who maintained that Xocolo had been the homeland of the Dominicans until after the outbreak of World War Two.[8]\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nXocolo was also a leader of the Latin American peoples. Unlike its Christian neighbors, Xocolo had one notable historical influence. Unlike Catholics who were primarily focused on a Spanish-speaking population, Xocolo's Catholic and Protestant neighbors were more oriented toward Spanish interests. Furthermore, Xocolo, like most Spaniards, had a high level of education, although Xocolo himself was almost entirely a graduate from higher education. It is estimated that of more than half (if not all) of Xocolo's political opponents, all were from within the Catholic Church.\n\nIn 1615, Xocolo established Spain's \"Gospel of Exiles.\" The \"Gospel of Exiles\" was an elaborate compilation of archangels' prophecies, and they promised the Holy One of Wisdom, the Messiah of salvation, to be \"the God of many nations.\"[9]\n\nAftermath [ edit ]\n\nFollowing the death of his father, Xocolo moved his empire into the Caribbean of Peru and the western coast of Mexico to the city of Aztl\u00e1n. In the end, the Empire of Castilla was unified over a period of about three centuries by the Dominican Republic, which ended up as one of Latin America's largest trading colonies. (The term \"Spanish Empire,\" which refers to either Mexico or another country, was later changed to \"Latin American Republic.\")\n\nReferences [ edit

{"id":525,"ended":false,"length":694,"gen_text":"On 12 March 1919, Marlborough was recommissioned at Devonport and assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, as part of the 4th Battle Squadron, along with her three sisters and two Centurion @ -1B and one Bismarck @ -1F. During the Battle, she was shot down with a Bismarck gun and killed by a shell fired by Rommel's men as she stepped on them. In the days following the Battle, she was called upon to escort Queen and Duchess of Cambridge to see the battle, and on 14 April she returned to Britain. She then joined her three brothers in the Royal Navy, and became one of the first British seamen with the rank of Prince of Wales; one of her brother Charles's troops was sent to Spain with a message from Queen's. She died in 1915, at the age of 83, after undergoing battle operations in the Spanish capital, Barcelona, Spain. Prince Charles died in February 1919 at the age of 95, and the Prince became the youngest monarch in history, and an officer in England and the United States who became the seventeenth king. She won the Royal Society Medal in 1923, and in 1939 also went to the World War. Her final battle was the Battle of Durov, in 1914, when she was wounded in a bomb explosion while in contact with one of the German soldiers who were fighting for the French in the French-Hungarian War. In 1915 she became the 15th female warfighter, and on 8 March 1918 she joined British forces and served at the end of World War I. She then married Louisa Leopold IV in 1921, and in 1915 went on to become a member of the Royal Ladies' Court, graduating from Queen's College and becoming the first Princess of Wales on 28 May 1921. She died on 14 January 1925 at the age of 89, after a long battle which was largely credited with her helping to lead the first women's liberation movement. On 14 March 1922, she led her army of 1,000 British troops against the invaders at St. Helena's, and with the help of the Princess of Wales was wounded during a raid near Durela, Switzerland, when she was captured by German tanks. The ensuing fire took several hours to extinguish, and was soon reduced to smoke by a German officer, who managed to keep her off the battlefield. The day after the Battle of Kiel the Royal War Museum at Portsmouth, N.H., has now been reconstructed and exhibits its contents and many other items from the first of her battles. A large scale display was created by the Royal Navy Museum in 1943, and this in turn served as the setting for the new exhibition Queen Elizabeth's Royal Wedding, which opened in October of this year to present at its opening. The museum is a two-story, one-room, brick building, dedicated to the memory of Queen Elizabeth II, and it also features the famous \"A-C-T\" statue by the British artists Mary Jo, Mary Jo, and Margaret Thatcher. The museum is located in the basement in the National Museum of British Art at Royal Holloway in south Cambridge. It also houses exhibitions of the Royal Navy and Royal Engineers, and it is in the very historic Royal Academy of Engineering, Oxford, where it was exhibited in 1877 and 1922. There are also several exhibits and collections at local museums around the world to help you get to know Queen Elizabeth II, and there are in the UK a number of private collections dedicated to family members or the Queen on behalf of an official.

{"id":4741,"ended":true,"length":701,"gen_text":"One week before the Canadian Grand Prix, the FIA declared the floor used by Red Bull in Monaco to be illegal, forcing the team to change the offending parts for the Canadian Grand Prix after three instances in which the floor had been broken.\n\nBut there was none of those serious problems when it came to the Renault F1 drivers.\n\nWhen Red Bull driver Andretti admitted that he used brake pedal pedals while on the phone with his wife of 5 years after F1's closure in 2013, Renault told Sky Sports that he could have driven under his current F1-era tyres.\n\nHe claimed that the incident occurred when he tried to use the tyres of his Mercedes-Benz E-Class because they were \"totally black\".\n\nBut according to the FIA's new policy for use of brake pedal pedals, any \"race result where a change in the brake pedal position is observed or when use occurs without the benefit of any change in the pedal position results in a tyre degradation will be considered to have occurred\".\n\nBut the Renault F1 driver denied this.\n\nAsked for clarification, Renault said: \"The FIA has in line with our policy on the use of brake pedal pedals and has a number of procedures in place to prevent any incidents.\"\n\n\"There is nothing wrong where the brake pedal is used in a crash, which is the way it should be used.\n\n\"However, there is nothing we can say without doing this and we had always done every single step in the process.\"\n\nIn response to Sky Sports' request as to how the FIA might have gone even further, Red Bull's chief technical officer, Vincenzo Montellari, clarified: \"We have a policy in place to prevent crashes on our track, as well as the use of brake pedal pedals in a crash.\n\n\"All we can say is that what we are doing is totally legal. No one's right to practice any sport under those circumstances.\"\n\nSo why did Red Bull's legal team decide it was too late to move the brakes on the Renault cars, even though Red Bull could be fined $5,600 - an issue not even the FIA has mentioned publicly before?\n\nThe idea that Renault's racing engineers might have been so busy changing their tyres as to make the driver's actions look like a racing accident does never come from within the F1 paddock.\n\nIf Renault's racing engineers were aware of that, they might now be trying to prevent the FIA from changing the brakes.\n\nOne of Red Bull's engineers, Bruno Fermi, was in France for the Spanish Grand Prix in 2013, where he had his car rear-ended by a Renault F1 tyre.\n\nHe told Sky Sports the car was hit over and over again and could not pass the turn signal that the turn signal signals were on.\n\n\"At the end of the day, there is no risk. If they felt a little scared that no one would benefit from passing a Turn signal, there would be nothing they could do,\" he said. \"If they felt that their safety or their safety would suffer, then they would be prepared (to push out).\"\n\nIn the end, Red Bull decided that it would be much safer to simply keep on moving the tires to avoid being fined.\n\nIt's possible to get a little more lenient with regard to a brake pedal in the case of a crash. Renault's legal team are likely to present an independent report to the FIA on the matter on Wednesday. At least that could be very useful for the Red Bull team - something Red Bull has never done for anything - even before it announced its plans to enter the 2015 Formula One season.","token_len":756,"entropy":[7.9762,2.6894,1.0418,8.1112,5.1372,0.0025,0.4868,2.4406,2.4303,5.0926,2.0294,10.5709,8.2945,1.251,5.1538,0.0077,3.7096,5.7745,1.7471,1.3653,6.2158,1.8156,4.9245,1.1449,1.2196,0.0555,3.2704,0.9995,8.2925,5.5481,3.946,1.2852,4.6084,0.8408,0.0001,5.1487,4.908,6.0289,3.2037,0.5178,1.2403,1.8737,1.2274,0.2791,2.8668,0.3352,0.4837,0.0005,4.1423,4.0076,1.674,5.7332,0.5836,3.7603,5.59,1.8698,3.6462,3.2437,0.4398,0.0642,1.0318,5.0826,2.229,0.1123,4.5635,1.4164,0.8539,0.0002,4.4154,1.7438,0.003,3.9482,4.256,0.0941,5.6005,1.8788,0.8542,3.6323,5.5875,2.817,1.6105,4.0737,2.3895,0.487,6.181,0.3697,2.3023,2.5444,4.2474,5.5297,0.3137,4.5004,5.4406,0.01,2.0389,4.1923,1.3198,2.718,0.1293,3.5447,4.7898,4.7246,0.3995,1.6081,2.1338,3.8872,2.0836,4.9402,2.8796,3.7525,5.576,4.0909,0.0208,4.5117,1.5343,3.1655,1.303,0.347,0.0002,4.4391,3.5529,0.778,2.0789,4.4585,2.4853,2.0973,0.8475,2.8711,0.0785,2.078,1.1713,5.1586,3.6537,1.354,3.0584,1.1375,0.5823,3.3187,0.3127,0.0993,4.8654,1.9989,0.6296,2.8808,4.7507,1.6927,5.3051,0.8279,0.3,0.0002,2.5436,4.9607,0.002,1.9931,0.9303,2.3584,4.06,3.1758,3.3432,5.0585,0.2001,1.3168,1.0761,0.135,0.5192,4.084,4.9623,5.5272,4.8802,3.6582,1.624,4.8345,0.5126,1.2109,1.7897,0.3888,2.9528,1.7653,4.7729,2.4934,4.1361,5.7442,3.6767,3.357,1.2419,4.1587,0.0273,3.2173,4.7735,0.1802,0.557,3.5662,0.3999,5.0819,0.0586,0.7817,4.6774,3.6252,4.5044,0.8779,1.7784,2.0491,0.535,0.7172,1.0266,0.0593,0.0002,3.8553,1.9685,4.5794,1.0059,0.0069,2.4322,4.1998,2.5396,2.0337,0.3237,0.0002,4.0612,4.2063,1.1928,1.2562,1.9596,1.5678,0.7254,0.0207,1.9863,2.8425,1.8015,5.5904,5.115,0.0878,2.7519,2.1755,2.6668,1.9166,0.3871,0.0132,0.4037,0.2546,0.1031,1.7029,2.0445,4.8778,3.7781,0.0031,2.6956,0.7273,0.0032,0.5172,2.1358,1.9507,4.6957,2.9378,0.2283,0.0002,3.0149,3.4939,1.0485,2.4371,2.2493,6.2576,1.3481,0.9465,0.0766,1.2078,1.5369,2.7525,1.3584,4.6263,1.8132,4.0628,0.6276,2.6866,4.2967,1.0073,1.495,0.0539,2.1724,1.1825,1.0412,0.0002,0.0499,2.4673,0.1203,2.1215,0.7575,1.4439,4.924,0.4458,1.6615,5.6052,4.6764,4.3962,3.6014,1.3538,6.1752,5.5377,2.8467,6.3806,2.6969,2.38,1.7069,0.8049,1.6048,2.3625,0.3205,0.0002,3.7184,3.7828,0.4034,0.7728,0.204,0.4525,2.0567,7.7217,0.1558,2.3663,1.4558,2.4928,3.6911,2.2771,5.6141,5.9294,0.0712,1.1362,1.4892,0.0013,2.3506,2.4746,1.3707,0.04,1.2114,4.6922,1.6435,0.001,0.0,0.8644,3.5398,4.5375,0.0577,5.8235,1.9941,0.0152,1.4456,1.4151,2.9975,1.4525,2.0464,0.0294,1.6944,1.0469,4.9859,3.3022,3.5042,2.6157,2.2758,3.7453,1.3181,0.0135,2.8118,1.3392,0.0306,0.9571,0.3183,0.0928,2.2152,2.4904,0.9251,0.868,0.3042,0.0002,0.0353,4.5897,2.6744,0.3709,0.2393,0.3438,0.3842,5.7137,1.0836,1.7748,0.5645,0.4865,5.6331,2.0032,1.5911,4.857,1.8718,4.1088,4.6066,0.2132,5.4489,3.3964,0.4678,4.4531,4.5463,0.8346,0.9676,0.4638,0.0002,4.779,3.0557,1.4801,0.6817,0.001,3.2796,4.5873,0.6895,2.7679,4.0659,0.3759,3.9397,1.1939,0.5422,5.4113,2.2005,4.5302,1.6127,1.0512,2.3465,3.4204,2.9627,2.8862,0.8084,3.203,0.0026,4.7749,2.6589,1.5469,3.1865,3.118,0.9539,5.3189,4.3797,4.3332,4.4585,4.5039,3.7959,2.82,1.0027,2.3825,4.5628,3.9282,3.9327,0.4946,0.0868,0.0002,2.2578,5.9372,1.1482,2.0305,2.2256,5.2637,2.2959,3.3503,0.4698,1.6267,3.5892,5.127,5.7016,2.7203,0.9319,4.4159,0.1746,3.1205,1.4178,5.0027,2.0431,4.7776,2.7986,1.4488,1.7053,5.9142,0.7946,5.0798,5.9617,2.2435,3.4716,4.1758,0.8547,3.1117,0.0091,2.5472,0.0072,0.383,0.1393,0.0002,4.7923,2.357,1.6725,3.6039,0.1588,1.2786,4.1449,0.4484,4.425,0.9652,0.8009,1.8926,6.4181,1.1287,3.7388,0.0715,4.0839,1.5977,3.1084,0.1802,3.9029,1.1409,2.2396,2.2099,0.3171,0.0002,5.086,1.3443,2.1415,0.001,0.0137,2.1791,0.7953,4.7837,3.8382,3.524,0.0273,0.0466,2.3097,3.5738,4.4583,2.1472,0.6059,5.4042,0.1164,0.0006,2.113,2.0539,1.9139,3.0148,0.5328,2.785,4.1884,2.2444,4.6431,0.2659,0.0963,0.3789,1.1331,2.206,1.167,0.0428,3.992,1.0027,0.3753,0.0002,2.5034,2.7619,0.2514,0.0921,3.9449,2.9734,1.2005,4.119,5.3978,2.8857,0.2209,0.8318,2.2626,4.7672,0.5171,3.8228,0.8935,5.5279,3.2852,4.3142,3.0481,5.4364,0.1572,4.1389,1.8061,3.1758,0.5121,0.166,0.0002,1.5887,4.3449,1.0981,1.3253,0.0654,0.2113,1.7851,0.6336,3.2628,0.9623,0.5898,4.7721,3.1546,2.939,3.847,5.665,3.704,3.9863,5.3242,3.6119,7.1279,0.6265,1.3794,6.0853,0.3596,6.1825,3.4045,6.172,1.1977,0.6115,3.9838,1.3353,0.4537,2.9845,2.2471,0.0995,0.0286,1.0146,0.7435,0.2882,0.0483,2.8778,2.7936,1.1331,1.3065,1.2805,4.2946,3.2925,4.3828,2.0229,1.8105,1.9122,2.0722,0.6369,1.4272,1.0842,0.8869,2.5088,2.8251,8.1041,0.4332,5.9836,3.5161,2.4806,0.0389,0.0002,3.4045,1.9246,1.4261,0.1829,1.9844,0.0014,3.3378,2.5775,1.7735,1.4531,1.9791,5.4525,2.4382,0.6238,4.3509,3.5387,3.3398,3.8943,0.8741,4.873,3.9132,2.0556,3.8515,2.2041,0.9458,0.2283,0.0002,3.1888,1.9552,3.8908,3.668,3.3731,1.8684,3.9905,2.0467,4.2009,0.0202,1.3024,5.5409,0.0023,3.8465,3.7475,0.1757,3.6981,1.7971,3.2397,0.0556,0.5602,1.2905,1.2765,5.7606,1.2094,3.7734,0.3247,3.4856,4.1777,0.0659,5.4049,2.8849,4.7847,1.004,1.6018,0.2251,0.1982,2.0027,1.0279,1.2428,3.3486,2.6796,0.5985,8.208

{"id":1960,"ended":true,"length":694,"gen_text":"Wales enjoyed a second `` golden age `` in the 1970s, with world @ - @ class players such as Gareth Edwards, J. P. R. Williams, Gerald Davies, Barry John, and Roy Hodgson that are currently playing in major internationals. The likes of Robert Huth and Billy Sharp have all been on top of the international podium in their short experience in the English domestic league as players since the early 70's.\n\nWith players such as Harry Kane and Paul Scholes leading the charge to win the Champions League and the Europa League for Wales, Welsh league manager Warren Gatland has taken his club to the best level since the end of the 1980s. The Wales coach has done so with the aid of three Wales captains and has also overseen the development of a squad capable of turning through an underachievers like Michael Carrick and Mark Sampson.\n\nWelsh champions in the Championship have won their first two home games after a 4-2 win against Bristol City and won the league title with their 3-0 win over Bournemouth last Saturday.\n\nHowever things got a bit maddening with the opening day match against Chelsea in London, as Wales lost 3-2 at home to a Premier League team who won 4-1 in their qualifying campaign.\n\nNow we know why the Welsh Championship is the best in the world, which will see them contend with the top six teams in the world, while their peers against Chelsea, Leicester City, and West Brom, Arsenal, and Leicester City take on a host of English clubs.\n\nIn the end they will be fighting harder against the best side of this world and will only be able to defend their title for very long before they get to their goal and finish the season at the summit of continental football, as they did against Manchester United.\n\nWales Football Club 2018 World Cup qualifier: Wales vs. Chelsea\n\nIn March 2018 Wales moved to the final for their first tournament appearance at the 2018 World Cup - a tournament that brings them two of the top three qualifying clubs in the world with the addition of the French giants, who also have a group of friends in France. During this tournament it was Wales who had to defend their maiden World Cup title with the goal of advancing into the final stage of the qualification campaign without having to worry about being crowned champions.\n\nThis year's tournament has had one notable element to it that could cause some concern in the minds of the world's foremost footballers. They now have a group of players aged between 20 and 21 with the youngest with 10,000 Wales fans in the top ten in their country. The age group of the older players are far more likely to be on the move, and so Wales players are getting ready for something special.\n\nWales are one of only two European sides to qualify for the 2018 World Cup - France and Germany, both with the first two groups in the group stage, playing their third Group B league game at the World Cup on Wednesday, May 10th.\n\nHowever in our last rankings in the following years we were given very few reasons for making the decision for Wales Football Club.\n\nThe next two editions are yet to be decided in terms of the final two tournaments, so some time has to go before we will be able to draw up our thoughts to see whether there are any specific reasons for deciding to put Wales in this position.\n\nFor a good look at the Wales Football Club

{"id":4816,"ended":false,"length":632,"gen_text":"In 2013, Juniper introduced new line cards for the MX series and a new switch fabric module, intended to upgrade the MX series'for higher bandwidth needs and for software defined networking infrastructure (SDN) in the future.\n\n\nIt will bring higher levels of productivity for industry customers with improved performance for small businesses, and reduced maintenance fee for the long term.\n\n\n\" MX7 and MX8 have been part of our growing lineup for more than ten years after coming out. The new MX7 and MX8 are based on newer and better designs, offer better performance, lower maintenance and the lowest amount of power consumption. The MX7 and MX8 were designed using high quality materials including 3D printing and resin made for high performance applications. Our goal with this product is to create a unique level of consumer choice by expanding the range of MX8 and MX9 switches, offering our customers the latest products with the most performance and lowest pricing,\" said David C. Johnson, CTO, Juniper.\n\n\nThe new MX9 switches are also now available separately for customers, so you can buy the same system with the same switch, or with a separate switch for your business or on ebay for less than $20. At this time, only 2,000 MX9 designs have been tested, so the MX series is the first to test this new line for its performance.\n\n\n\" MX9 will provide users with a reliable switch with more options without any performance and lower maintenance. MX9 will work better for business customers over a wide range of workloads that are required to accomplish the important tasks that customers look for, such as Internet application, business systems, communications, networking, application servers, and data centers, and as a platform for other software and services that can access these applications and services directly from your computer. By combining the performance of their 3Dprinted switches with the higher capacities of MX9, we can bring high performance switches to meet growing demand for ultra-efficient, multi-core desktop computer components. The 3D printed switch for MX9 can serve even more services than the traditional MX9 switches for desktop computing using less power consumption,\" adds Dr. John P. Shaffer, director-general, the Juniper Technology Group, the Americas.\n\n\nYou can order a sample of the new MX9 switches today. The MX9 line will be available nationwide from Juniper. Customers should contact Juniper Customer Service at 480-862-5857 via their online customer support or through the manufacturer's website. Additionally, customers are encouraged to request an exchange by visiting the Juniper Customer Service Forum.\n\n\nThe MX9 switch line is currently available in three sizes: 16mm, 24mm and 32mm, to suit our needs. The 24 mm switch has two additional capacity slots for connecting to a 3.5mm socket that can hold up to 3,600W. The 32mm switch has two additional capacity slots that are for connecting to a 3.5\u00d720mm socket - and a 16mm capacity slot for connecting to a 3.5\u00d716mm socket. These sizes are available in 3 of each type.\n\nKey specifications\n\n\nBrand: (Specifications in bold represent actual values only)\n\nCapacity: 3,600W: 2x1 \/ 8\" \/ 22mm \u2013 2x4 \/ 8

{"id":2071,"ended":true,"length":735,"gen_text":"By the 1930s, though his public success remained considerable, many literary critics saw Walpole as outdated. His reputation in literary circles took a blow from a malicious caricature in Somerset Maugham's \"Battles in My Pocket\" that depicted him as a child of fortune, his own daughter of a wealthy merchant family who owned an estate in the city, and that in the late 1940s he was a former prostitute whose daughter, Grace, married a wealthy merchant of her own fortune. As a teenager, Walpole made a career on the National Front and later spent his life living on the fringe, taking his social anxieties to the borderlands, where he fought Nazis and was arrested by the Gestapo. While he never came out for any major public cause. In a 2006 book A Brief History of an American Novel, literary historian Robert Luthring, who has written extensively about the American novel, says, \"He was an uncompromising, self-daunting 'the world is a big mess' kind of guy, and there's so much here about him that's a touch of misread.\" But while he remained popular in the literary world, Walpole was also a prolific and controversial historian. As he explained his personal life to the New Yorker magazine in 2006, when he was asked if he considered himself a political thinker, Walpole replied, \"I thought it was so important to have people like that talk about my views, and my views aren't based on any political thought at all. I'm my life.\" A few months later Walpole launched into a public apology for his treatment of the New York Review of Books, which he wrote for. Walpole, whose autobiography, It Takes a Village, comes out in October 2011 and was the subject of a recent New York Times investigation, noted this \"dramatic lack of respect for the writer\" in the New York Review of Books, saying that \"I do think he took things too far.\" At the 2005 San Diego Comic-Con, Walpole gave a short presentation during which he talked about the controversy he was involved in. \"I took this issue very seriously for a number of years, and I got used to it,\" he said. \"I've done something I didn't want to do, and I'm getting tired.\" Walpole's political commentary seemed to play right into the hands of journalists who found him to be one of the most divisive figures in American politics today. When a reporter asked about Walpole's views on homosexuality and homosexuality in particular -- his first major piece of commentary on the issue took place, in 1999, in an article he wrote for this month's New Yorker. Walpole then said that if one were to take his view on homosexuality seriously, then \"You're not wrong.\" One of his more colorful comments was when he made a remark to fellow writers, who also tried to hold him to account on the issue, that \"I'm not gay, I'm just a man. If they take a little risk that no one will read my paper, that no one will buy the book, but I'm no homosexual, then I'll run in for my death-penalty verdicts.\" \"You can't be a straight white male in the United States of America, you know,\" replied one reporter, \"You can't be a homosexual in the United States of America, you know. Because you have a gay son, and a gay son's a gay man. You have a gay daughter, and a gay daughter's a gay husband.\" And while Walpole was never banned by the press, it remains to be seen whether another writer would join him on his crusade against the gay rights movement, just as the novelist Richard Dawkins was on his way out of the university by 1993.","token_len":762,"entropy":[2.6862,8.2744,0.1416,0.3371,5.701,8.1765,5.4454,8.9277,6.1522,7.7195,0.2242,4.9245,8.0023,1.2284,3.8818,10.0768,0.4565,0.4402,8.7344,1.2286,2.6754,4.8508,4.0212,3.9901,0.4314,6.1678,0.5564,5.0204,4.4185,3.2059,10.2703,6.5841,3.544,10.485,0.459,0.0351,0.0026,0.9642,3.0393,4.8184,4.4188,0.6098,3.488,6.2638,2.3396,1.4691,1.5761,3.3471,0.6123,0.1487,0.7717,5.1362,2.1594,5.4107,1.7605,4.9855,4.1655,4.7974,2.8315,1.4904,1.7433,2.6282,1.3992,2.9046,3.777,3.2272,2.0863,0.5589,2.021,2.8289,2.3109,0.7034,3.7393,4.3941,2.178,3.3842,2.1374,0.0016,1.236,1.3163,2.4948,5.9331,5.2158,4.4625,5.3134,2.3526,5.5707,0.4624,3.9201,0.7916,1.7919,3.4664,4.5001,3.6007,0.3085,4.1674,0.4483,4.0186,1.7664,4.137,0.3647,0.7255,0.0003,4.8129,1.5099,2.1785,5.6677,1.1785,5.1902,2.9885,2.1208,3.7742,4.7995,2.4047,2.3648,5.0143,3.0571,0.5795,3.5681,3.4885,4.9526,3.5902,5.2966,5.0426,0.0,1.3387,1.1241,5.7807,3.6028,2.2702,1.8644,0.212,4.3593,5.949,0.9701,3.0676,3.1989,2.2071,0.7659,1.0348,0.0001,1.3331,4.9163,2.2095,3.6916,4.811,1.8585,5.0635,4.5761,5.1117,2.2235,4.6552,7.1353,2.7332,3.0912,4.7769,3.1236,7.2139,4.86,0.1603,0.042,5.82,0.6948,2.5741,0.8387,5.8585,2.8048,3.4315,4.1158,5.431,2.03,3.206,1.1298,1.6643,0.6803,1.2273,0.7702,1.8307,2.7353,1.3145,1.5906,3.1749,2.7609,0.1021,3.4248,1.0098,2.7947,5.6561,0.0039,2.4282,3.3334,0.0533,4.6821,5.6746,6.2938,5.3404,5.8005,1.7337,1.908,3.5992,2.1815,0.9894,2.0504,0.011,1.228,1.7324,1.9078,4.0743,2.0338,4.627,0.1269,5.6729,1.9665,0.5099,0.5882,2.062,3.9342,5.2016,2.3335,5.6831,5.6601,0.9446,3.6968,3.9472,1.8463,4.7792,3.2571,1.873,1.1491,2.9953,0.4456,0.3359,1.6143,0.0004,1.7367,2.2813,1.4913,4.465,2.9454,2.5113,6.0784,0.7288,3.5543,2.6676,4.698,3.2287,4.4492,0.6406,1.7849,2.0666,1.1354,1.3829,2.3889,0.4501,3.5895,0.3284,5.6217,0.9455,1.143,2.2313,2.497,0.2988,3.6899,0.3304,0.6716,4.6018,2.3777,0.4012,1.3811,0.0003,0.9911,0.5395,0.0392,0.979,5.4518,1.9578,0.3455,4.7513,3.2991,0.5985,2.5273,3.1422,2.6007,2.1971,5.135,0.5347,2.1467,3.5145,2.0621,1.2292,4.5087,1.9494,4.004,0.0003,4.9726,0.2573,2.4826,3.1872,4.6784,1.709,0.0026,1.1083,0.9442,1.8325,6.3049,5.7273,1.6925,4.1845,2.1135,2.2567,0.2451,3.3079,0.0005,5.3404,4.6197,0.782,4.4591,4.2242,0.8535,1.0125,4.6993,0.2999,1.8084,4.6744,0.5474,3.8294,0.0077,0.0,0.9656,1.9081,1.0906,3.5013,4.0903,2.4461,3.2976,0.0008,2.7092,3.6784,4.3285,1.2972,6.546,2.5702,0.3901,0.2715,0.539,5.7849,0.1987,0.847,2.5603,5.4032,3.1198,2.2131,3.9823,1.1785,0.0032,0.6758,3.4947,3.3918,0.6367,0.1137,3.6994,0.2244,5.5452,5.9079,4.4072,5.0488,1.664,0.0389,4.7104,0.005,2.514,0.5811,1.5476,4.3086,2.9192,1.9018,1.6682,3.2025,0.8027,0.9223,0.4853,0.0003,2.0186,3.4042,1.6794,1.545,2.3662,4.2829,2.303,2.2475,5.5754,3.5305,0.7404,0.4862,1.4156,4.8267,0.5873,6.977,3.9613,1.0549,0.4637,0.2305,0.0004,0.3824,0.7237,0.0006,4.1157,0.5863,4.2447,4.2632,5.924,0.1282,0.0437,3.0705,0.0989,1.9201,5.1727,2.8594,2.4338,2.3372,0.1603,2.1459,1.5748,1.0666,5.1436,2.9513,2.3757,1.684,0.1644,5.0884,0.8518,2.9108,0.0031,0.4565,1.3148,0.7283,0.8138,5.1523,5.3095,0.0103,0.2559,1.0363,0.3635,0.2666,0.4309,0.511,1.0327,3.0434,3.7621,5.0988,2.5938,2.9895,0.0005,2.2245,0.1766,0.1283,1.371,0.6193,0.618,1.7864,5.3292,4.8351,4.0276,2.545,0.0013,2.0715,5.1352,5.4983,5.5413,0.5306,5.3524,4.2442,0.0965,0.487,0.4636,0.0018,5.3954,1.4214,4.9605,1.442,2.059,0.0459,4.5659,0.0621,0.3259,0.7309,4.4153,0.5598,0.2873,0.6583,1.9751,3.2466,0.1728,3.9938,3.4491,2.1929,0.6322,2.9713,1.7344,0.0011,0.3413,2.9627,0.4692,3.2879,2.0561,3.0318,1.2149,4.6064,6.531,3.5655,4.0823,2.5055,3.8354,0.9334,3.4047,1.0108,0.9131,1.2665,5.5474,0.1958,5.6814,0.7922,3.8244,0.0914,1.5378,2.0512,1.859,3.3846,0.2547,0.3721,6.933,2.3975,0.0799,1.5547,1.0946,3.6431,2.2261,0.002,4.6243,2.8444,1.1256,4.3237,4.5347,1.7738,0.165,3.1317,1.9806,2.8405,0.9622,0.6009,2.1855,0.3393,2.4294,2.1123,5.8291,2.4088,2.2546,5.9935,2.3998,4.4752,1.1148,1.0436,3.5143,4.9993,1.22,1.6898,3.2074,0.4137,4.5488,1.0613,3.8109,3.311,5.6948,3.438,2.4205,2.5499,5.5092,5.2714,0.0433,5.4898,0.6373,1.3744,0.8147,3.5135,1.0351,0.5752,0.9833,0.5914,1.7361,1.7271,1.6745,1.2909,2.5861,1.5996,1.0566,0.3165,1.9242,0.7451,2.235,2.4987,3.5684,3.8785,3.8743,3.2498,3.684,5.8279,4.6275,6.8581,0.1493,0.8952,1.8996,1.4242,4.6707,0.5034,2.3644,5.0314,0.0353,0.1967,3.4883,3.6134,0.5101,0.4551,4.5656,1.2253,0.9299,5.736,2.8037,0.4281,3.0067,0.865,2.3412,5.9301,4.522,3.4199,2.7807,3.565,5.2901,1.5142,0.0223,4.4336,4.783,0.7409,3.514,3.1754,2.6835,0.9193,2.5534,1.3707,3.9722,3.2393,2.3979,2.451,1.6251,2.2433,0.0041,2.1162,0.0084,2.0534,2.0455,1.7917,1.5208,4.3349,1.3354,4.0357,1.4418,2.3155,4.1545,1.4881,0.1813,0.3822,0.7299,2.2368,0.9981,1.0863,0.3833,0.0056,0.2189,0.0024,1.3074,0.5652,0.1784,2.2533,4.4884,1.7831,2.896,2.3562,3.7754,2.9915,1.7481,1.1641,2.262,0.5979,1.3978,3.0543,1.4953,1.0469,0.9691,1.4049,1.8224,1.6551,0.7888,0.6209,2.4276,0.6086,0.1466,0.1628,0.0295,0.1747,0.0135,0.0876,0.0812,4.1583,1.1458,4.1382,3.4708,1.5192,0.0007,2.2852,4.0193,5.7238,2.72

{"id":4692,"ended":true,"length":649,"gen_text":"In January 2005, Fleury announced that he had joined his cousin Todd Holt and former NHL players Gino Odjick, Sasha < unk > and Dody Wood in playing for the Horse Lake Thunder, where Fleury was in the fourth round of the 2011 draft. Fleury was selected in the sixth round of the 2008 NHL Draft by Nashville and has been a three-way center in his 12 NHL seasons since joining Nashville from St. Louis last October.He has had a successful career with the Flyers of the US Hockey League in the playoffs each of the last two seasons, beginning with the 2010-2011 season and the 2016-2017 season. His 14 goals with the Blue Jackets set the franchise standard for goal production; he finished the regular season with seven goals with Pittsburgh, with four points (one assist) and eight penalty minutes in his final eight games.Fleury has been extremely productive with his style of play, with 6.25 points (7g-12a) and 5.0 goals against average (1.3g\/5a). He also has taken over responsibility on the penalty box during the second period of a game, which allowed the Lightning to tie the game and give the team two power-play chances.Fleury has won two Stanley Cups and earned MVP honors from Finland (2004), where he was named to the First-Team All-America Team for two different games (4-2-1) during his career. He was an assistant coach in the NHL for the Toronto Maple Leafs from 2008-2011 and a member of the NHL's Eastern Conference All-Stars Team in 2011.He played in 11 games with Florida last season (six starts) and has scored five goals with an assist per nine games, scoring three points in a 6-4 win over Nashville in the fourth round of the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. He has a 5-foot-9 frame that makes him a bit of a physical defenseman in the NHL, playing well on the powerplay.Fleury was selected by the Toronto Marlies in the eighth round (109th overall) in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft, and is an entry-level NHL defensive player in the AHL's Buffalo Sabres. He has two goals and one assist in eight games with the Erie Monsters of the American Hockey League (AHL). His NHL career starts in 2005 with the Montreal Canadiens, where he spent three seasons with Calgary from 2008-2010.With 22 goals and 34 assists for a career-high 44 points in 39 games with Las Vegas last season -- more than any other player in the British Columbia Avalanche's roster -- Fleury has also been a member of Edmonton in the NHL's top two defensemen. His three goal season is tied with teammate Brandon Dubinsky for the third-most total goals by a Calgary Flames defenseman in two seasons.Fleury's scoring-shot totals (27-26-43) include five points (two goals, one assist) with three penalty minutes in his first nine appearances before being sidelined with injury on Oct. 20 - a game in which he failed to convert an in the scoring by Ryan O'Reilly, then missed a penalty in front of the Lightning's net - to win the ECHL Central Division crown in 2002-03.In 2012-13, Fleury appeared in six playoff games in which he recorded seven points in 22 games and was the NHL's second man-advantage-addressed defenseman with a plus-12 plus\/minus rating.

{"id":1097,"ended":true,"length":701,"gen_text":"The role of the stay @ - @ at @ - @ home dad is not traditional in India, but it is socially accepted in urban areas. According to one sociologist's study,'Indian families that are stay-at-home dads are better off than their neighbours because of the lower fertility rates'. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @\n\nIt is a very odd dynamic for this young mom. She got her start at a public school for boys, after being encouraged by parents with two options: schoolwork or marriage. After joining the Kumbh Mela school, she became the second mother in 4 years.\n\nFor our friend, Mrs. Zemlata, who has been staying at the same school for her entire pregnancy with little help from her parents, it was really difficult. She started a blog titled 'I Know I'm Missing Out' in her spare time, which has since been published about her story.\n\nHer blog post has given us the following tidbit:\n\nWhile having three children from her third marriage was a nightmare, she decided it was time to move on to family life. After living in the US for one year, she started her own business and set up an outlet for her 'lost-over' self. At the same time, the relationship continued and despite her difficulties, she managed to work the business at a faster clip. When asked about that incident as well, she asked: 'What will I be doing like two years after my first marriage? And when? Do we even need to talk, will I find the time to be open on our own, live in this place, and work at my own pace?'\n\nThe 'lost-over' Mrs. Zemlata is now living her life as a stay-at-home mom on her own\u2026\n\nWhile I was busy with work at a busy home, my wife, Zemlata, wrote, 'I know we could be friends in the future; we both love to read.'\n\nThere's absolutely something creepy about that idea. My wife and I will miss out.\n\nThis has been going on all spring and summer, but we were just getting started. That is, until we heard Zemlata say that a new family would be arriving to help make us better. The family is already in Bangalore.\n\nFrom the family's statement, it is clear that the family has been coming this summer to provide support. I want to thank her for going to India this summer after two children so far, while doing something she loves \u2014 to help me take a different journey. I sincerely hope this family gets together and makes a difference in my career.\n\nSo far, none of us have told her that we're coming. We're busy with the family, with our kids and with the couple of us that have moved to India in the past \u2013 we need to do something to support each other in case of emergencies. It hasn't been easy looking back. There could be a huge leap in terms of financial stability for most of us.\n\nOur next family meeting was a little bit further down the line \u2013 I'm looking forward to getting on to work with them to make sure it's all a good one.

As part of our research, we created an online database to track all published books regarding the New Age, including popular and historical books, books about science and the paranormal and religious works on spirituality and atheism. Our database, like the one published today, has been downloaded over 10.9 million times already, the largest download recorded since the founding of this collective which gathers public interest in the literature of the New Age movement. So what is the New Age movement really doing this week? This is the answer we get when the topic is called \"In Search of a New Life,\" as they call it.\n\nWhat we are searching for are books about paranormal and paranormal psychology that are unique to our world, written by experienced writers and bestsellers. In light of what our community has endured in this century, we are giving readers a better understanding of the real life influence which paranormal and paranormal psychology have on our world and around the world. All we want to do is make them part of our personal history.\n\nOur mission is simple: to inspire and inspire those who wish to make informed decisions about their lives by helping them choose the perfect place to live, a spiritual, spiritual or religious place.\n\nThe New Age Library is dedicated to educating and learning and celebrating that New Age. The Library is an important part of our community and helps us to create new books for the New Age movement and to have a real alternative to the traditional publishing of science fiction. We are using our collection to spread the word of the New Age movement through our book club community and with our non-profit affiliate publication the National Spiritual Community of New York City, we hope that we inspire and inspire more people to become secular and have a non-biased view on what scientific fiction and alternative spirituality is like.\n\nOur online library is designed to be a place to share and discuss the literature of your country, your beliefs, your beliefs in spirituality, religion, and most of all to connect people to the latest, new news, new knowledge and new ideas in ways no new media are in the past \u2013 by sharing books and giving out free readings, essays, lectures or book deals with your friends and colleagues. If you could join us in our community and read as many books as you wanted, it would be much of a tremendous success.\n\nIf you see anything you'd like to add, let us know by leaving a comment below.

{"id":1188,"ended":true,"length":707,"gen_text":"During their 15 @ - @ day rest periods the company's men congregated around the Belgian @ - @ owned Elizabeth Hotel, in the centre of the city at the corner of Causeway and West End, in a space known as Cincy Mall. The women worked for around 7 hrs with them all for \u20ac1 an hour.\n\nThe company has also been criticised by a number of UK unions over recent decisions that it has been accused of being too supportive of certain women and girls.\n\nThe report points out a number of issues have cropped up over the past couple of years but is mostly centred around the company being linked to one or two of the above mentioned unions and the sexualisation of staff.\n\nIn 2015\/16, the Eton branch was the target of a number of allegations of employee exploitation. The report found that more than 80% of the allegations in the report were about Eton employees and that its board member, Lisa Cunliffe, is the only member of its board to have an alleged relationship with an Asian female\n\nThe report also found that the company has been alleged to have employed a \"high level of female employees and of having inappropriately touched and raped some female employees who had already been hired\" in 2014.\n\nThe company had also been cited in the report by one of the Eton members, which was shared on social media.\n\nThe company is also said to have employed 15 female managers without any report and at no point during those 15 years did the company disclose any of the incidents to the public that included allegations that had never happened. The reports were later deemed to have come from only three former Eton employees.\n\nIt is understood that the company is also using the term \"male sex worker\" and in 2012 had been named in a New South Wales bill that would allow the company to deny a male employee employment for up to 30 days after being hired.\n\nThe Eton report said that under the legislation, the company was not obliged to disclose its work in relation to the complaints it was made about. However, the report found that during that time period the Eton company was used to help raise concerns over the use of women.\n\nOn March 23 last year, the Eton Board of Directors was asked again about the company's sexual violence and health and safety record. The board included the fact that several of the women said they were sexually assaulted by the company on the train where they worked but also said there was no evidence to support this claim.\n\nThe Eton Company has, since May 2016, also been reported to have had a number of allegations of sexual exploitation by women on a daily basis.\n\nThe report says that of more than 8,000 claims made to the Eton board over a period of more than two years, only 2,300 have actually been settled.\n\nThe company also has \"a significant gap\" in report after report that it did not identify the women hired by staff, despite a number of them being employees in the company's offices.\n\nIn one case, a woman has told the Eton Board of Directors she was verbally harassed and propositioned by a female former employee in October last year. The report found that she was told to move out of her room and told \"they\" were to go and that the \"we\" were \"looking after you\".\n\nA third case was a former former employee whose case was also heard in the year ended February of this year.

In 1851 Francis Clark wrote that `` Waterfall Gully is the most picturesque landscape in South Australia, in the way that it is generally viewed. It has been likened to a hill with a gully on top''.\n\nThe '30s'\n\nIn a country of 70 million people, there were only two types of swimming pools \u2014 those built after 1929 and those built during the early 1970s, and each had its own unique design. Pool 1, however, has stayed the same for many years after being finished in 2000 with two unique features:\n\nFirst the largest and most impressive pool on Earth is at Pemba. It's a 4.5-mile long pool that is now the pool of choice for the South Australian golf course.\n\n. It's a 4.5-mile long pool that is now the pool of choice for the South Australian golf course.

First, the pool has its own unique set of features \u2014 the pool is surrounded by five giant lakes. At the lower end are the two most amazing pools in Australia, located on Pemba. Pool 1 and Pool 2 are both over 200 feet in diameter, and Pool 2 is a 20 foot large pool with two huge floating water systems. Pool 1 is the oldest pool in South America, while Pool 2 is the largest swimming pool on Australia, and pool 3 is the largest swimming pool on South America. Pemba is where the South Australian grand tour begins, and Pool 4 is the first high altitude swimming pool. On June 14, 1972, Pool 6 was reopened by the North Queensland Department of Conservation after being inspected by the Federal Department of Environment and Water Resources, which determined that the pool was unfit for human use.\n\n, and Pool 2 is the first high altitude swimming pool.

Pool 1 was built a century ago now. It's the latest of three pools built after the World War 1 fire. As a result, the pool, which is located near the National Park, is not in danger of being completely destroyed. The new pools run only from 12 to 14 hours, and are designed more for recreation (no longer have to pay for fire protection).\n\n. It's the latest of three pools built after the World War 1 fire.

The new pools run only from 12 to 14 hours, and are designed more for recreation (no longer have to pay for fire protection). Pool 1's water is heated to 55 degrees Celsius, with a temperature of about 65 degrees Fahrenheit.

{"id":1310,"ended":true,"length":685,"gen_text":"Almost 70 % of the Pirates'rushing offense came from running back Chris Johnson, and the rushing offense itself consisted of two \u2013 thirds of East Carolina's total offensive effort. Six of the teams in that group were true rushers, and the other three, like Pittsburgh and Boston, were secondary rushers. That makes the defense'play to the end zone, a key tactic in Pittsburgh's recent defense that is making its biggest impact right now.\n\nThe game thus far is a big one in how the offense and defense align. It includes three rushers, but no offensive linemen. All three have been successful in running with two linemen, with one being a first-team All-American on the team. That means Pittsburgh will have a starting running back on hand through his first three regular-season games. As a result, the defense ranks second in rushing offense average in the nation with 20 sacks (behind only Denver Chiefs'defense'average, who have led the league) and second in rushing defense average in the following 10 games.\n\nThe defense also has three running backs \u2013 center\/guard R.J Green and right tackle Paul Richardson and right tackle Chris Conte. As a result, Pittsburgh's offensive run defense has been significantly better (43.9 ypg, 39.6 ypg+, 1.7 R, 1.6 YPA, 0.6 S, -28.5 ypg, -15.9 ypg). This is especially true considering Green's numbers for this span of two seasons.\n\nIn the game's biggest statistical game, Pittsburgh's defense completed 57.8 % of its runs and was 7-of-32 (45.0%) from deep. That gives a 6-point differential, and their defense leads the NFL in total YPC and YPA, which is their biggest strength. Pittsburgh's defense ranks second in rushing defense average, just behind No. 1 Seattle defense. The defense ranks second in total defense (2.0 ypg) out of 15 non-conference squads and second in total yards per game per game (2.1 ypg).\n\nPittsburgh's defense was even more impressive at the free throw line this year. Pittsburgh did very little running out of the open field (38 percent of their free throws, 23.9% dropped free throws, 1 point) though, and the team scored 22 points and gave up just a point in the first half to Kansas. They ended the game with five more first quarter turnovers (1.2 turnovers) and three fewer than they had the previous two games. Pittsburgh also finished with four turnovers and scored only five points in seven quarterfinals.\n\nThese numbers are far from expected from any one team \u2014 especially one like Pittsburgh that has a team with all of these players. Pittsburgh has been doing what the Steelers have done in free kick games this season; going away from the spread-breaking concept that once a game is over, it will be no different today and there will be no need for players like Green to attack the rim, no matter how he goes against the defense. It also helps explain why Pittsburgh will have two different offensive lines (one at left guard and the other at right guard) when the defense returns home.\n\nAlthough New England is missing a lot of talented players, the offense has been even stronger this off-season. The defense has been much better when offensive coordinator Pep Hamilton is in the job, and he has already added a few young offensive linemen to the team (John Brown, Andrew Whitworth, Justin Durant, Will Fuller and Jerrod Heard ). Those three new additions add some big-time talent to the offense that will have a big impact when the offense returns home \u2013 and as a result, the best team in the AFC South looks great in 2017.","token_len":775,"entropy":[8.493,5.2781,0.1333,1.9958,12.9087,1.7017,16.9744,10.9915,3.6504,3.1658,0.5107,4.8152,2.0594,4.9182,1.6355,0.9621,2.8154,2.2495,8.5889,1.9589,7.0734,5.4503,0.4642,2.8486,9.0115,13.4301,0.2424,11.9257,1.8196,0.1462,3.5552,3.5319,5.2976,0.3658,7.7001,0.698,0.3798,4.6212,2.1294,3.2425,1.6855,2.0086,5.8309,6.1729,0.0103,0.0022,0.8318,1.1496,1.883,2.5662,1.8372,3.8015,3.134,4.0096,1.3888,4.7061,0.1588,0.9085,5.5187,0.8916,0.0021,0.0001,0.3365,4.4544,3.3106,1.5143,3.7989,8.5939,9.2737,4.3384,1.0667,4.9387,0.961,3.2722,3.785,2.1357,5.2499,1.4136,3.4835,0.0711,4.7249,4.9106,3.4247,3.0411,5.0595,2.4121,3.0976,0.7526,5.0506,0.0702,0.3171,0.6352,0.0007,1.9869,5.3166,5.4655,0.6586,2.2994,1.9817,5.3533,1.7743,3.4056,4.7571,1.0412,1.8176,3.348,0.1922,5.0593,0.6542,3.2331,5.618,2.994,5.0404,0.0023,0.0005,1.2163,3.5571,4.7383,3.0623,0.905,0.6082,4.2604,0.9445,3.3387,1.9601,4.922,1.4137,3.6375,4.5756,4.0366,4.4263,1.5108,3.4271,2.8619,3.2066,1.676,4.0475,0.2416,0.6423,0.2314,0.0768,0.7945,4.9586,1.0456,1.6736,0.6194,3.5067,1.3924,2.9223,2.6206,1.4812,2.0374,5.451,2.2776,0.0639,2.4177,5.2234,5.6482,4.9925,1.0442,1.669,5.5612,0.9607,0.0004,0.1028,0.9821,4.6738,2.0967,0.718,0.1208,1.131,1.5352,5.6447,2.7431,0.6239,1.2058,1.6858,6.7222,2.9795,0.8206,1.8973,3.62,4.9369,5.0581,2.9688,3.1887,0.8687,5.1916,8.2446,13.0056,12.6294,2.9401,6.534,5.6605,3.3468,4.3945,1.8627,5.0651,0.3426,0.8691,4.7158,0.2359,2.2292,0.436,1.2797,0.6806,0.6345,3.0348,0.6003,6.1534,5.1923,0.1484,0.4907,0.6806,0.0002,1.7788,2.1852,1.4588,1.1028,2.0249,2.2474,0.1723,3.2819,5.7348,5.5013,3.324,5.5199,1.8693,0.0348,8.7036,1.2012,2.1597,0.5664,5.585,2.5985,3.4644,1.3563,0.7312,3.8089,3.4666,0.3361,0.7855,4.5247,1.2034,0.487,0.0669,1.8955,1.5196,2.4255,6.0424,0.6345,2.0791,1.6929,5.0072,1.0002,4.117,5.3634,0.5539,2.387,4.1692,0.1642,1.1296,5.1055,0.3738,2.1686,1.0663,0.9259,4.993,4.1906,0.4159,2.5357,3.5375,1.6706,1.6705,0.2797,2.228,2.7497,0.2487,1.4754,3.1226,0.0918,2.3009,2.5932,3.0679,4.2224,5.5784,0.7935,2.2367,2.1422,0.2612,1.0642,1.6146,3.8512,0.2189,2.6475,0.4515,0.0153,3.0288,3.7504,1.3325,3.4109,0.6248,3.599,3.9975,1.5218,4.8104,4.1081,2.5836,5.4391,2.1693,4.0036,0.4048,1.4311,1.352,0.0002,3.3847,2.009,4.5542,1.3682,5.8992,5.3926,4.6044,0.8284,1.5838,1.6132,2.1677,5.9827,4.0145,0.319,2.2529,2.4709,0.0391,0.3821,3.2371,3.3406,3.6984,4.7608,1.4783,2.419,0.0013,5.7997,1.8051,4.1739,0.5588,2.4089,0.7459,1.0475,3.1063,0.9336,1.7079,4.8397,3.4819,5.2135,1.0758,2.7123,3.1547,2.9583,2.5136,5.9762,2.9571,4.8088,0.1906,2.1876,0.4666,2.8664,6.5738,2.278,2.4799,2.6143,0.2616,2.3356,2.7115,1.0633,5.5231,3.8846,2.3098,0.4098,2.7262,0.9469,1.4543,3.2826,1.7306,0.3642,1.6274,0.5875,0.2524,2.0039,4.4563,0.2229,5.2973,0.001,1.1549,4.0185,4.9589,1.6496,2.4664,1.9785,3.3068,2.0119,0.2219,2.5047,3.0716,2.7626,3.5909,0.6058,3.1434,0.9567,0.1103,1.559,7.048,0.011,4.5117,5.0216,0.0501,2.2993,5.1128,2.4785,2.2099,0.3884,2.2008,2.0216,1.9309,0.6764,5.5641,0.8728,1.2647,2.7351,0.007,2.7012,0.897,0.0131,0.3777,0.723,0.0001,2.608,0.006,0.7251,1.3931,3.7655,4.1827,1.3086,1.1327,3.6204,1.148,5.1872,0.74,0.0018,3.0324,1.7147,1.0161,2.8647,6.1046,4.974,0.5509,3.9019,3.7678,0.2844,0.3411,4.8912,0.095,2.3027,4.7075,3.2412,0.5706,1.2856,2.9428,0.5044,2.368,4.417,0.7948,2.3437,3.1838,6.9647,3.0692,0.3447,0.9807,3.8658,7.437,1.9004,6.4645,1.279,1.1678,2.459,2.5582,4.8925,4.8759,0.7203,4.3969,5.1082,0.0557,1.7609,4.8068,3.3787,2.1611,1.4704,2.4185,0.4707,3.4542,4.6364,3.2813,3.7647,5.1472,0.6101,0.7247,0.4231,4.1896,4.3572,5.0751,3.5224,2.6925,2.3772,3.8285,1.6281,2.5242,1.318,1.304,1.1233,3.75,4.3385,3.2389,1.5261,1.7537,2.9428,1.4847,1.1797,1.0208,0.4408,3.2253,2.2346,3.1997,0.9432,3.1091,1.0623,1.9114,4.6227,2.482,2.9744,0.1736,1.0346,5.2347,5.8882,4.521,0.7078,0.426,0.0002,5.436,1.4614,1.3703,4.554,0.5343,6.0335,2.0673,3.0677,3.1096,1.2655,7.2391,2.7457,2.2438,4.8521,0.5071,1.8687,1.2935,2.4891,4.965,3.9262,5.4516,1.8792,3.5891,3.3118,0.92,3.2041,1.8704,2.2477,5.5919,3.5782,2.7233,3.0416,1.3345,1.1396,1.9625,4.0002,7.609,3.1795,2.9294,0.7183,4.8353,4.5215,5.9113,0.3192,0.9311,4.7043,3.4885,4.7354,4.8804,2.231,5.4977,1.8174,2.8363,0.9882,1.4845,0.3061,1.891,3.2849,1.0695,6.022,1.4696,5.6326,4.1554,4.8852,0.9069,0.2367,0.57,3.3305,0.7069,4.0657,1.7333,1.7906,0.9584,5.0924,0.7662,5.6121,2.8819,5.2931,0.2929,0.7547,5.0762,4.0208,4.446,1.1897,2.9016,0.2758,3.3504,2.765,3.5157,3.1217,0.2057,2.3053,4.1273,1.8528,3.4316,5.2001,2.071,2.025,4.0537,1.5148,4.3352,1.2323,0.8673,0.2582,2.1242,0.0391,0.113,0.283,0.4294,0.6781,3.9042,1.5323,3.5198,2.3528,3.6138,1.231,0.6212,0.0002,5.6517,6.7688,0.4191,2.3612,4.6155,1.9184,2.274,0.2261,4.0932,1.1778,1.1963,1.6342,2.5898,1.463,1.532,4.9428,3.1996,2.0869,5.8097,0.0429,0.0126,0.5277,1.3651,2.2934,1.3341,1.8774,3.8087,0.616,3.8619,5.5897,2.0437,4.7562,0.0106,1.5469,1.7342,1.8396,1.3123,0.9271,1.1293,3.8094,1.2723,4.7719,4.4121,1.4513,2.3498,3.6188,3.0046,0.7405,1.5607,1.0857,2.7666,3.8762,5.503,3.4383,0.2849,5.2181,0.5356,0

{"id":2606,"ended":true,"length":732,"gen_text":"Isaac Newton = Sir Isaac Newton PRS ( \/ < unk > \/ ; 25 December 1642 \u2013 20 March 1726 \/ 27 ) was an English physicist and mathematician ( described in his own words 'first' in 1833 ). Newton was the first to realize that there could be no single source of information for the universe. On 26 September 1768, he published in the journal Nature a report entitled The Complete Nature of the Universe.\n\nHe was right [by] stating [the Universe was] a multi-planetary body with a common centre where all matter was located and it could exist. He called for the creation of new stars, moons and planets; further, for the annihilation of the universe; for creation on a mass scale where all matter is located with a radius of 3,000 miles; and finally for the creation of new universes, which could form in a universe whose mass scale is 637 miles.\n\nThis was a massive, revolutionary statement from a man and woman who were working with very different, and not so convincing, philosophies.\n\nWhile making this statement, his friends at Queen's University in London noticed that Newton had a slightly different idea and began to think that this new perspective had to be considered. Newton suggested that his new theory was that there were no physical laws of nature where the universe came into being in the first place which made the world into a multiverse. He suggested that the universe had been created by an external source (universities) and that every single life there could have had life on it. When asked what that source was, Newton explained:\n\nthe law of attraction would say for a certain length of time that every individual has a number that is proportional to their speed and their number would mean that one number would represent their velocity and this would be measured on each individual's body, which is their body mass which is 1\/2 of that of the universe, where any number greater than 1 represents their speed.\n\nIt was not until after studying Newton's work that I came close to this new answer. It was after all the evidence suggested otherwise by Newton that we could be sure that the universe was not, in any meaningful sense, an un-ancient cosmology where the universe had not once been seen or heard.\n\nThis was important because Newton was absolutely right. He said there were no laws of nature where all the things we now know about ourselves can be said positively or negatively about something else. We can be totally sure that our bodies were first created through the power of gravity and that they, like all life, would have evolved to live this life to death.\n\nIf Newton said that if one could see that there were no physical laws of nature, what he meant was that the world had never been seen or heard before all human beings could experience these experiences.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nThere is absolutely no reason for anyone to believe that our knowledge of the Universe was once a lie. The only question is that no one can be sure of it.\n\nIt may be the case \u2013 but this is very much speculation at times, because there is so much doubt about it that I am sure many scientists (including mine in the beginning) were misled by this story. However, it would be much of the same for anyone who was concerned that the Universe was a lie, because even if there were physical laws of nature which make things happen, there could never be physical forces that can turn reality around to make them happen.\n\nA lot of us were wrong. This article takes the view that that could be very difficult for people to accept \u2013 because nobody wanted to believe what he had just just written. I hope you have seen his writings, as they are a very worthwhile read for anyone who is worried about the future of the

{"id":2149,"ended":true,"length":723,"gen_text":"Most stars are between 1 billion and 10 billion years old. Some stars may even be close to 13 @. @ 8 billion years old \u2014 the observed age of the universe................\n\nThe Universe is too big to form from nothing...................\n\nEven though God has created us, we have no time for anything. He is just waiting for us, and we will never have enough! No matter what happens to Earth, we WILL make new beginnings, and new civilizations, and new civilizations will emerge.\n\nWe must fight to have a planet on Earth for at least a hundred years, with a perfect number of worlds: an infinite number of worlds per year...\n\nWhat can we do to help our children? One simple suggestion would be to spend more money and use telescopes to see what is and is not possible....\n\nBut there is something we have to say about science : God has said that science won't work in a vacuum, because there is no way we can make a scientific discovery from nothing.\n\nScience can't make breakthroughs through science.... No one can make a breakthrough using science, because the best evidence comes from little experiments.........\n\nThere are several basic principles we must follow in doing this!...................\n\nFirst, we must remember that the universe is large. Everything in it can be described by just about anything.................\n\nWe need laws for measuring things.......................\n\nThen, we need methods to make predictions about the way things will behave after billions of years. The only time that we should be concerned about predicting the future is when we understand that life is out of control.\n\nNow, let's say that the laws of physics say that we must create the universe at the center of the galaxy. This isn't what God wants, even as you can imagine it..... The very laws He claims do not work. If you had a million years to do a science project that we will not make.................., it means you will never even make it for this billion years....\n\nYour friends have said they will never make good predictions about the universe, even if you could make them......................\n\nGod has promised that, \"If we make it, we will make it for a billion years; We will have an infinite number of worlds on Earth for a hundred years. Then the universe will disappear, and no more life will exist in that place for a hundred years.\"\n\nThis is the only true message that God can put on his mouth. The only way to prevent a planet planet would be to create it at the center of the galaxy to see whether there are any life around.\n\nAs a result, when you make things happen, there will be no life in that galaxy.........................\n\nThen you will have to spend much more money and learn how to make anything......................\n\nBecause no amount of good science or new ideas can have all the answers to this!\n\nAfter billions of years we will make them for billions of years. It has become necessary to start again, to build the largest civilization on earth to this very day.\n\nWe now have a very, very big world to build on. Its size is going to be determined by how much you do...... So you probably won't make things right in your lifetime..............\n\nAnd you probably won't make it through the billion years when everything in the universe is at a certain point, and the sun must be working for millions of years.

{"id":1185,"ended":true,"length":694,"gen_text":"The dam is protected against over @ - @ topping by two spillways. The spillway entrances are located behind each dam abutment, running roughly parallel to the canyon walls. The spillway entrance has 2 spillways that are closed. The exit to the Dam can be reached by simply running east through the dam. Water can also be brought to the Dam through the spillway. The dam is expected to flow into the canyon with about 15 days of moderate rain during winter.\n\nThe dam is located above a small canyon wall, on the main main street where it leads to the Canyon-Stairs Canyon in the mountains. The dam has a diameter of 4.3m with an open rim that slopes to the sides. The Dam is currently expected to flow over about 15 meters of the canyon walls through an easterly direction.\n\nDue to the strong winds, the dam has no water circulation in the valley. The water level in the valley is considered to be below normal flow and is generally not low enough to be able to produce water vapor at the dam level.\n\nThe dam has a very quiet canyon. A sign posted on the rear porch in the upper right of the dam will say:\n\nDam No. 3 Dam No.2 @ 2.9 m @ 45 m @ 100 m A dam at 2.14m in the canyon, which will drain from the main dam to the dam level is expected to produce approximately 3 litres of water vapor per hour and provide 8.3 litres of flow. The dam at 2.49m is due to provide about 15 litres of water vapor per hour.\n\nThe main access for the spillway and exit is about 9 m south of Haulage Rd, and about 11 m north of Haulage Rd and across the border. On average, an hour and a half can be held in the dam for about 1.2 litres per hour. Although, in less stormy weather like June, we see that the spillway entrance is likely over 1.2 litres each time. There is little water pressure with the main access going over this, so you may need to bring some food and water to get some closure of the dam.\n\nThe main entrance of the dam is in the northeast corner of the valley between Eglinton & LaSalle, about 2.9km north of The Haulage Rd. There is a major parking lot at LaSalle near a dirt track that we will cover over the next few days.\n\nThe first of these signs has a little message printed on it showing the location of the spillway entrance for this area.\n\nThe main access is about ninem back from The Haulage Rd and about three and a half nautical miles down the canyon wall. The two main access gates for the dam are right next to the spillway entrance and are under the main access at Haulage Rd (if you're not looking) and the main access to the main entrance from LaSalle. After you exit a side entrance, there are two main access gates between main access and Main access.\n\nThis is a short-lived spillway that was developed in the winter (2000 to 2004) and was never completed. Since most spills here are not quite completed, there are still a number of stories in our archives and a well known story of spillway entrance work (there are many other stories along the highway) which will be updated in the near future.\n\nIf you see the main access sign, you may have seen the first of the last old dam that could be used to drain the remaining water from the dam above The Haulage Rd. We hope that it will still have service in the future.\n\nTo view the main access sign, go to the link above, or by any of the links

{"id":4832,"ended":false,"length":740,"gen_text":"Johnson further established himself as a quality player in Phoenix. In his three years as a Sun, Johnson averaged 14 \u2013 20 points a game and provided tough defense. He played in 76 games over one year in the league before being traded to Chicago. Johnson scored 41 points in 41 games with Phoenix. Johnson did not play in any postseason games for the Phoenix Suns. The All Star forward will be expected to have an easy season after posting a season-opening 60.4 FGA. He is a big three-spot on the roster, and has put up solid stats on both ends. In his four years as a Sun, Johnson averaged 9.7 points, 9.9 rebounds and 3.6 assists in 21.4 FG% and 42.2 FT%. In the last four seasons, Johnson is shooting 48.7% from the field and 43.4% from three with 8.4 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game. He is the Sun's leading shooting big man and will be an asset to any team in the East. A five-foot-11 perimeter scorer with the ability to create a decent amount of offense, Johnson is a great shooter and is a valuable weapon for the Suns.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Jim from Excellent Player!

I had hoped to use the new \"Star Wars\" characters in the movies, which will make them great, but now I think I will be disappointed with the lack of a sequel. What a disappointment! I will absolutely be buying these characters in 2017. If you want to get my opinions then I would encourage you to read this article, so I can tell you I won't hold back my buying a season pass!\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by JB from Love these characters... They absolutely are great! My main issue is that the character names and faces will not be what you expected out of this film and I love these characters!\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Crayon from I bought this for a game, it was good enough for one night. My biggest problem with this film is the lack of any character names I am looking for in the original movie. However, after playing my copy of The Matrix for a while it is apparent who is going to be the main villain. I have the option of using these characters in the sequel to The Matrix 2. I would rather not pick a name that is too generic. Now, I would love new character names because they make me feel like I must have bought them before going to see that movie. Also, if I were a moviegoer and went to my local movie store to pick up this character name and then went to the movie theater and there was only a name on the shelves, I would definitely look for her in these movies.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by ErikaF from Great addition This guy adds a cool new dimension to the main character by adding a whole new storyline to his character that is much more intense than the first movie!! I am sure many of you who have seen The Matrix and were like \"wow!! This is what it would be like! This was a great addition\" I am so excited that I am going to go back to work with them to make this film into movie!!\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by jb from Awesome character as always!! Love how I liked to find my way around the globe...great for when I could be very close to the movies....will do my best to add some story for every single movie...just remember that it requires more

{"id":4068,"ended":true,"length":705,"gen_text":"Throughout its run, Neighbours has featured several guest appearances from celebrities playing themselves or characters. Early cameos included former Skyhooks musician Red Symons, Warwick Capper, Molly Meldrum, Chris Lowe of \"Battleship,\" and others.\n\n\nIt's unclear why Neighbours' characters have featured in other movies or video games since it has opened, and that's probably due to its early development and lack of development with those characters. The team was also involved in the early days of Disney's \"Alfred Hitchcock, and the series continued to draw on its source material and give ideas for its characters for new titles, such as The Snow Queen Trilogy. (For review of the most popular members of the Neighbours staff for Neighbours: Season 1 see this post.)\n\n\nNeighbours: Season 3 features many characters who never made more than one appearance in the upcoming series, notably the members of the Housewife, who can occasionally change color to suit her lifestyle and mood.\n\n\nIn its third season, Neighbours: Season 3 featured a new addition, a character named Miss Beaumont. Miss Beaumont was initially introduced in the episode \" The Beauty and the Beast\" in which the real Beaumont, the daughter of a prominent businessman, enters the movie world where she meets the young girls who play in her likeness, which is set in the 1970s. In \"The Beauty and the Beast\" she discovers her father was a real man who had been murdered by the British government and had had a long and troubled history due to that incident as well. The young girls begin trying to convince the main character to get into business and convince Beaumont to accept them, as well as taking advantage of their celebrity status to recruit other girls to their side. However, the truth is that Beaumont is not a real woman, and she was never in her real life.\n\n\nThe next day, Beaumont finds herself in the custody of her father's executioner, a fictional character named Moo. There she meets James Bales, one of the main characters, who is responsible for capturing him, and sends him over to help free the captured Beaumont. The main plot of Neighbours Season 3 revolves around a town with two criminal groups that are on a campaign to save the city. The town is being invaded by gangs of criminals who will target any and all who come into their territory. In the world where the game is set to launch, many of the characters in \"The Beauty and the Beast\" are working, working as \"beings\" for the people who are currently living in the city and have no friends.\n\n\nIn addition, after winning a competition of sorts, the main character, James Bales, comes across two other girls, all of whom are named Miss Beaumont. Miss Beaumont, on the other hand, was actually not selected to be featured in \"The Beauty and the Beast\" because, despite being chosen as a special character in a previous series, her time in the film was not allotted to her. In addition, her father is imprisoned for murder as well, and one day, Miss Beaumont gets in touch with her father's executioner, Miss Beaumont.\n\n\nThere are also new characters from last season that have appeared, such as a member of the Housewife who has also appeared in the movie, a former gang member whose character in The Housewives, Miss Beaumont, was recently on set.\n\n\nAs there is no official release date for Neighbours Season 3, we can only wait to find out if Neighbours: Season 3 will feature the actual season premiere or not. The series first debuted its official webisodes on October 2nd, with first details for Season 3 to be announced soon.","token_len":783,"entropy":[5.7174,5.1237,0.7861,11.1711,3.4605,0.0021,1.6044,5.6057,3.9546,5.5641,1.9581,1.9273,4.5162,9.4562,5.1735,4.783,6.1626,1.9988,8.1039,10.3116,0.0116,3.1063,5.8118,7.9626,10.0454,2.4857,7.8273,7.9751,9.063,2.5166,0.8606,9.6024,6.8258,8.1201,0.5774,8.6118,7.6669,3.6587,0.4387,0.4416,5.1126,6.1422,5.7326,4.3138,4.5012,4.328,1.1673,0.0476,2.4131,1.5427,5.5561,0.3572,3.9108,0.0005,4.3641,1.4537,2.4761,3.6637,0.6163,0.0027,0.0023,2.9206,5.2054,2.3875,5.5188,0.9737,3.2511,3.2933,2.0,4.6434,0.0299,3.7489,2.0401,4.1091,5.739,2.6015,3.2015,4.7551,2.3447,3.4312,1.9175,0.0686,1.7413,5.0007,2.9032,2.4459,3.5858,0.0908,3.8861,4.4475,6.0024,1.9474,0.4384,2.3613,4.8521,3.6533,2.4308,3.7363,0.2763,1.469,3.7969,4.0173,0.0376,5.539,0.7166,2.792,4.2904,5.3112,0.3224,0.3172,4.5199,3.465,2.2605,7.9727,4.65,1.3225,5.5745,1.4331,2.3427,5.3345,0.0394,2.3394,5.6364,5.9978,2.2472,2.4412,1.7902,4.2878,4.2429,3.757,2.2847,1.8382,0.0016,2.8403,5.691,0.4769,7.1806,1.7463,5.3693,3.8934,6.6928,2.3266,1.2274,5.3995,3.1444,6.2149,0.0936,0.6205,2.0993,0.0387,0.0107,4.6644,6.2654,3.4863,0.0045,0.017,1.8956,3.4312,1.8087,4.0534,2.8245,1.9515,0.55,0.6965,0.0005,3.591,0.0116,0.0052,2.5624,0.5891,2.8353,5.0262,4.7848,3.1287,2.0931,5.1453,2.3204,7.5096,0.1783,1.4775,0.4666,0.8191,0.8739,6.6559,2.7484,1.1788,5.9743,2.5115,6.121,0.0794,1.0776,4.9824,5.7579,1.4849,2.2029,4.927,6.0795,4.9553,5.2506,2.7547,3.7662,1.8749,4.5515,2.1308,5.9068,0.776,2.1126,0.0003,3.0642,3.7418,4.049,0.615,0.1206,0.4245,0.0016,0.0026,1.5296,0.0787,0.9425,4.0278,1.8238,2.0723,4.3127,1.8722,2.5155,3.3325,0.6976,5.436,6.057,3.8778,0.036,1.2657,2.5248,0.0492,0.0004,0.0027,2.0736,3.9051,1.9876,1.2562,1.1565,3.3983,0.2759,7.8152,6.1845,1.4772,0.0624,0.038,3.5922,2.3825,0.2991,2.4296,5.9956,2.1591,0.0043,0.0016,2.8607,3.0631,3.6798,0.0203,1.4434,3.7843,4.3928,0.4366,5.7214,0.8378,5.2544,3.7829,4.4836,0.509,2.2098,2.2411,4.9032,5.7097,2.462,3.1431,3.1447,1.7655,5.4093,2.3859,3.8934,1.7182,5.1809,0.7019,1.3828,4.052,0.064,0.4949,3.1407,2.9379,1.2113,0.7415,0.0559,0.0102,0.0058,1.421,1.8824,4.8666,2.6941,2.5029,2.7019,1.2333,3.4645,2.4196,1.6675,2.1828,1.7098,2.7162,1.0806,2.0205,5.503,1.7102,2.1701,4.2844,4.8898,1.4621,3.3153,2.2647,1.9825,2.3084,7.1327,0.023,5.1734,3.9313,6.2045,0.7841,1.1689,2.4748,3.7764,0.3679,5.4074,6.1802,0.0741,3.9589,1.7897,5.2401,0.8102,1.0972,4.236,3.5748,4.7508,1.9892,5.4939,2.6555,0.0003,0.001,0.6603,4.7129,2.3401,1.7957,4.0023,1.2344,0.198,5.5746,4.0895,0.0036,2.2671,5.6103,0.3456,1.2366,5.3147,2.2542,1.9838,1.4045,1.7695,1.7562,0.7266,2.6346,0.0832,2.2409,5.9622,0.8225,0.3867,1.27,0.0004,0.0014,1.4248,2.3078,1.9507,1.0398,2.5848,1.2619,0.7463,2.0839,3.4787,2.2029,3.4027,2.3666,2.5013,0.418,0.9662,1.4605,0.0003,2.132,3.5846,3.8237,0.5076,1.561,0.0002,0.0018,3.9754,1.2069,1.2906,1.2303,5.6966,0.016,2.4058,1.2074,1.7491,5.5686,0.1287,0.5082,3.0854,5.7152,1.5272,1.2967,5.3939,5.0702,2.1574,5.6651,1.8874,0.5422,6.2558,5.2428,5.3617,0.3151,3.8947,0.011,0.3435,2.304,0.3405,3.1454,0.9993,1.5326,4.9309,0.0028,5.9356,4.2223,2.4972,1.0107,5.0521,0.5689,5.0923,0.216,5.618,6.1887,1.5285,5.1534,1.9449,0.0031,0.0014,0.4669,2.1927,3.7437,4.5113,1.1031,2.1817,0.0026,0.0045,2.8837,0.0629,3.0651,0.0032,2.7665,6.0048,4.0381,3.7289,5.7455,2.1845,2.6582,1.8546,4.342,1.4888,6.2854,0.5184,3.8693,0.987,3.1444,1.6225,1.6034,3.7261,1.0534,4.1515,3.2287,0.0811,4.5145,0.737,2.2049,1.7509,4.5275,4.6656,2.5015,2.7685,0.0658,2.403,3.5296,1.7522,2.4113,2.0215,0.7832,3.1202,1.4857,5.9937,4.4529,1.1521,3.7407,0.6437,0.6974,5.2046,3.8579,0.2495,4.2423,1.1176,0.2568,1.7714,2.0898,4.3444,0.5145,0.1147,0.0055,0.0101,0.0016,0.0177,0.9881,5.1528,4.9133,3.7326,3.3515,4.9166,5.2746,4.9069,0.3633,2.2434,0.7634,4.6654,1.5237,1.7424,4.7568,3.3865,0.7277,0.5565,2.0172,2.604,3.6566,2.4613,5.0546,1.5012,1.0995,0.0004,2.1688,2.8875,1.6022,5.3125,5.8494,1.6139,3.9205,4.4912,2.8129,1.2207,1.4277,2.7273,1.0937,1.8958,3.465,0.4424,0.0088,0.1537,4.4541,1.1822,4.0659,2.7631,3.4589,1.9219,5.6188,1.1114,0.0933,0.8221,4.2899,1.664,0.1867,0.0022,0.0106,0.7228,3.0773,0.0455,0.0008,0.0084,2.3988,4.7424,0.0374,0.0155,0.0015,0.0329,2.9935,4.0234,4.9987,5.6024,1.9631,1.1125,4.4748,0.2749,2.3178,0.1075,0.0068,0.0025,0.0037,0.0022,0.782,1.7172,3.7589,3.3564,1.1128,4.6804,1.8309,1.4332,5.1683,1.5909,2.6707,2.8823,2.1188,2.3032,0.2661,2.6691,5.4435,0.8493,0.4375,2.3679,1.2869,2.0847,5.3558,0.5845,0.4816,0.9924,2.3769,2.6599,0.1651,2.9772,3.4949,2.5258,5.1605,2.2607,3.0947,4.6931,0.5216,1.1635,0.8647,5.4362,2.2668,1.138,2.4914,0.043,0.0008,0.0029,4.0093,3.9581,1.2277,0.0129,1.7485,0.5947,1.7555,3.8235,0.0152,0.8954,5.2163,1.6896,0.0126,0.0067,1.7095,2.1024,0.0004,4.8362,0.994,1.6194,3.4102,1.2099,2.835,5.3519,0.4216,2.5207,1.7011,1.3797,3.5847,1.4084,0.0012,3.5229,4.2612,0.0625,0.3718,2.1086,0.391,1.5258,2.6977,4.4723,0.9259,0.2469,1.1013,2.0045,1.5366,2.5134,3.7659,5.283,0.4066,4.5858,3.709,3.2352,4.2222,3.6256,2.9516,2.5195,3.1793,0.9434,0.0009,0.0038,0.2114,1.8225,4.6765,5.4885,3.0772,

{"id":2739,"ended":false,"length":747,"gen_text":"Icelandic cuisine consists mainly of fish, lamb, and dairy. Fish was once the main part of an Icelander's diet but has recently given way to meats such as beef, pork and turkey since the mid-1800s.\n\n\nIt is interesting to note how Scandinavian-based chefs with roots south have chosen the Mediterranean cuisine for their menus, as the Nordic cuisine is not a part of the classic Scandinavian cuisine. The cuisine is influenced by Mediterranean dishes of fish and pork and veal, as well as other dishes including pork chops and pork sausage.\n\n\nThe European and American culinary scene is also influenced by European or European-inspired ingredients. On the other hand, the European and American culinary scene is one that originated on a large European coast area. In particular, there are numerous places in Europe where one or more dishes from the European cuisine, such as pork chops, have been adapted to the European cuisine. The culinary scene in Europe can be considered to be from a single and diverse sea ecosystem.\n\n\nI have never found Nordic cuisine here but the similarities are quite striking :\n\n\nGrowth : Nordic cuisine has existed throughout the Mediterranean period for a long time in this country. This is not to say that the seafood is not abundant. Most of the food that is locally available in Nordic countries (such as steaks and seafood) came from this area which is mostly located in the Mediterranean. In Europe, the Mediterranean Sea offers a rich variety of foods without any European influence. This is especially true in Germany where the Sea is predominantly populated by natives who were imported from the Middle East and North Africa. The seafood market in Nordic countries like Sweden will only become more diverse as the population continues to increase in Europe.\n\n\n: Nordic cuisine has existed throughout the Mediterranean period for a long time in this country.

Agriculture : There are many places around the world where all seafood imported from Scandinavia is also available in Nordic countries. Most of these dishes are made by hand and many are made using the Scandinavian traditional method. As a result, the seafood, such as tuna, whitefish, crab and beef are very popular in Finland and Sweden.\n\n\n: There are many places around the world where all seafood imported from Scandinavia is also available in.

Food Supply : Nordic cuisine also serves various regional and international cuisines from the region. This is one of the main reasons why Scandinavian countries don't compete for international food deals in the world. We are grateful (for that!) for the opportunity to eat with our locals when we are not in the food of most European countries. There are many places that offer different things in a variety of cuisines because the food is not always available in a given order in North America. The following are only the major regions of Sweden where there are different cuisines : (The list reflects the region's cuisine that could be served to you with only some variations on your favorite

{"id":796,"ended":false,"length":739,"gen_text":"Oldham's Old Town Hall is a Grade II listed Georgian neo @ - @ classical town hall built in 1841, eight years before Oldham received its borough status. One of the last residential developments in London that did not have to be renovated, the Old Town Hall was abandoned because of serious structural challenges. Its former owners paid a great price to keep the building in place, but its present location could not hold on to those debts. The building was once called 'Town Hall' and is located in a public garden in the west-west corner of Old Town Hall. This garden was named for its green, green-green shade. The garden has always been a favourite location of mine and the picturesque garden is situated on a topography where sunlight is most effective with a perfect view.\n\n\nFor any one reading about Old Town Hall's architecture, it shows up in a variety of places, notably the London Zoo Garden, Great Hall, Old Parliament Square, the Old City Hall and the East Town Hall. As part of our research, we created an online database to locate known Old Town Hall building & other buildings. We have included historic buildings, street names and names of famous buildings in this database. The database contains details about architectural projects and architectural history in Old Town hall (including historical descriptions of the buildings, the buildings' colours, the buildings' sizes, which streets were named, the number of buildings in Old Town hall, what their owners owned etc).\n\n\nAll images \u00a9 Westminster Architectural Society\n\n*We have removed photos in order to provide a more accurate picture. As always, you can ask for help with this work and will receive a free gift card. It is very easy to use - no need to create a custom application using Adobe Illustrator, so don't hesitate to ask.\n\nShare information about a building found in a London architecture category on your website with your friends on Facebook (you may share the same image on Facebook). The information that you share will inform everyone about this building.\n\n\nAbout Old Town Hall Architecture Ltd.\n\nThe London Architecture Foundation is pleased to announce that we will be using an online company profile to identify, share, archive and use this project.\n\nOnce your information is entered, you have a 2-year right to share any information, you can not opt out of sharing this information with anyone.\n\nTo further help ensure your rights for information and protection are still being protected, we have created a website.

{"id":2493,"ended":false,"length":755,"gen_text":"`` Pam's Replacement `` received generally mixed reviews from critics. HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall complimented the episode for staying true to the characters compared to the rest of the season, which he described as ''pretty short in length''.\n\n\nIt goes without saying that while this episode is somewhat understating things, let me give you the facts for you to consider. The episode centers around the disappearance of a mysterious woman who vanished after her ex was taken without her permission after finding and killing the man.\n\nIt is a fairly obvious plot twist where Pam is able to take her own life and the mysterious new man turns him into a vigilante. On top of that, the mysterious killer that killed her also turns Pam into a vigilante. That is to say, with a killer's identity, which is very much a mystery at best. As a result, Pam can be a pretty boring and lopsided person with little real impact on its world but that really goes some way towards explaining the plot twist.\n\n\nI can't argue that this isn't the ending for Pam, however. She gets the second cut of season seven. It turns out she is supposed to be back on the show for her new show and that the first cut is cut so quickly that it was only just before it started airing (which the writers didn't want to happen, of course).\n\nInstead, she goes to the psychiatrist, who gives her a 'counseling' course, and starts to find out what happened on the day that Pam vanished. At first, it looks that the reason that she hasn't been seen since then is because she's too scared to leave and she doesn't want to go to prison if necessary. In response, Pam gives herself a 'quit' and goes off in the forest but somehow falls asleep. One scene, when she's not supposed to go, I thought didn't even get the laugh out of her.\n\nIf this wasn't intentional, then this wouldn't be a very interesting moment during Pam's new show and one that would detract from it, given that this is an episode that will have an almost entirely different tone over season, season one.\n\nIf this isn't something the writers decided to do, that would be a perfectly fine example of something which has a positive connotation and is seen as one of The Wire's good moments though, and one that should be given some hope that this episode has the kind of momentum it needs.\n\nSpeaking of momentum -- the first cut of season seven shows us her with quite an emotional effect. It appears she has been lost for quite some time, but the story then becomes clear -- once they found that there are two new people of interest, they take her for a ride instead of the car. We learn just how fast these two become separated, who they have become... and how far they can travel before their own people die\n\nFinally, after the new man becomes a vigilante the team finds new evidence of his true identity and find a way to get rid of the old one by helping Pam out of a car. That leads to their downfall. Pam is no longer a vigilante and no longer a criminal, but in search of her true identity, she is able to use her skills to convince other people to trust her and put them to good use, when in reality it's just to get a job or something. Again, that alone would allow the series to build a following from its audience, and as always it can't always be an easy path (which is why the last episode ended up being even more fun than the first was ).\n\nOne can only hope that the writers are trying to give us more suspense on the show, as the final episodes of season seven will surely give the show a lot more hope of the fans in the future.

{"id":1340,"ended":false,"length":678,"gen_text":"Cougars are slender and agile members of the cat family. They are the fourth @ - @ largest cat ; adults stand about 60 to 90 cm ( 24 to 35 in ) tall and are about 30 to 40 cm long.\n\n\nIt is the fourth species to be known in Canada with short legs and a straight butt.\n\nTheir long legs have long ridges, a dorsal fin and a lateral fang that is much larger than the hindquarters.\n\nTheir fin is the strongest.\n\nIt is the second largest cat to be discovered in Canada and the second most abundant.\n\nA small, fat muzzle cat (also called peregrine falcons or peregrine leprechauns ) has a tail that is long and slender. It has a muzzle that is long and slender.\n\nPossibly more than 80 feet long, it is probably the smallest of any cat breed (both its size and weight make it some of the lightest cats in Canada).\n\n\nA cat that weighs a little over 700 g\n\nA cat that weighs more than 100 g\n\nA good indication of the difference in size of a small cat can be seen from its small size.\n\n\nPossibly more than 40 inches from your cat's butt (just a bit above the tip of its tip)\n\nA kitten which is so small it has only a short head\n\nA kitten which is so small it has a short tail and a tail similar to those of a short cat.\n\n\nA cat that is so small that the underside of its mouth is covered with a thick tail, possibly like a thick-rimmed bow-bow\n\nA cat that is so tiny, it has claws the length of its neck\n\nA cat that eats nothing but raw flesh, mostly meat, a little more than a tiny bit\n\nA cat that is so small that the top part of its neck is covered with a thin tail that is large enough to fit its mouth shut\n\nA cat whose ears seem to be hollow\n\nThe most important aspect of a cat's temperament is its ability to learn food. If your cat is going to get tired from one task or eat something the cat will learn new things that it isn't used to. The only way to stay happy, keep going and get back at it is to try and eat one or two things at a time. If you think your cat has the ability to eat anything but its mouth then congratulations! Now you can take some inspiration from the diet of these cats who, like you, eat some of their favorite foods from the pet store. They may not have the same appetite control as your cat but after a long time of dieting they may start feeling satisfied with the foods they are accustomed to. If all you can do is sit and stare at your cat's mouth your cat will give you enough food to feed him for a day.\n\n\nNot much is known about the diet of the peregrine falcons but a few have eaten a variety of the following foods:\n\n\nperegrines\n\nthe \"small\" diet (also called Peking duck diet)\n\n\nchickens (also called chickpeas)\n\n\npets\n\n\nbreed of fresh food from the animal kingdom\n\n\nwild animals (dogs, cats and even small birds), such as guinea pigs, sheep, rabbits\n\nfeline people (including dogs from the wild), people of South Africa, Australia, Canada\n\n\nhuman

{"id":802,"ended":true,"length":670,"gen_text":"Liverpool gained entry to the competition by winning the 1979 \u2013 80 Football League, entering as English champions. Their opponents in the first round were Finnish champions Oulun Palloseura. The first leg final played three matches in Helsinki and played in Helsinki Stadium on 1 February 1982\n\nThe Finnish club were crowned champions by the Finnish Football Federation and the tournament opened for everyone to play their part.\n\nThis wasn't the first time that Oulun began training during winter time before his arrival and when the programme began he made no secret of his love of football.\n\nThroughout the course of his playing career his passion was to play the game. The Finnish Premier League (FPL) were famous for their great youth teams and on 9th October 1986, he joined them with a 4-0 win over his old club, Leipzig.\n\nWith more than 80 minutes played the Finnish club won the league with 6 points, an easy win for Oulun's side, who were led by midfielder Johan de Jong, and an extra man in the side.\n\nOulun's main goal for Oulun's side was to stop Ajax in the third minute and score a goal for Lausanne.\n\nAnother goal for Oulun for Lausanne was scored in his last minute goal for Lausanne. His goal, however, also turned up in the game. He had created chances for Ajax, while also adding another goal in the 6th minute for Oulun's side.\n\nHe had also got two goals against Leipzig two game later, and scored three goals in Helsinki, while scoring one for Ajax at least in Helsinki.\n\nHe also made it to the finals, scoring a goal in a 6-4 draw with Hoffenheim in the final league match of his career, a score which Oulun won.\n\nDuring his retirement from football Oulun moved to Amsterdam.\n\nHe also spent six years playing for the club before moving over to Verviers after being elected president and managing director.\n\nOulun took charge of the club for the next 12 seasons, winning promotion to B, league cup after cup.\n\nOulun took charge of the club for the next 12 seasons with Hoffenheim.\n\nHis first wife was Mary.\n\nOulun's father is currently one of the principal architects of the Club and the club has a number of architectural and artistic works over its ownership and many other contributions to the club.\n\nIf you are going to come, it is very important to keep a high level of privacy to avoid any suspicious activity and have no problem if one of your friends or family members makes a mistake, while you are at it. One of the things that helps this sort of behavior is keeping a low profile, not having your contacts or other personal information on your smartphone.\n\nIf someone goes to your home after your footballing club, they take a picture with you, and if you ask them to take a picture with you in the lobby of your house, they will give you a photo of their private belongings. It is very sensitive and it gives your personal information off to the authorities.\n\nIn terms of the future of Oulun's football career it depends on how you deal with it.\n\nSince 2008, the Oulun Oulun Park has been named among the best in Finland in the top six European Football Association clubs \u2013 the EFL or the Finnish Football League.\n\n\nIt was founded by former FA Director Frank

{"id":1405,"ended":false,"length":752,"gen_text":"In early 1994, Khoo was retrenched from KFC as a result of an ownership change, despite contributing to increased sales and profitability. He said : Months before leaving my office, I had been selling KFC in the local grocery store and on eBay, and there was nowhere for me to shop. Eventually I did get paid and moved to a new location that was really, really new \u2013 KFC Headquarters. My job there was to make KFC better \u2014 and I wasn't afraid to make any changes.\nIt was a very good experience for me. I was living on a budget, and the company was booming, and being successful was easier with the money I was getting. Everything that I could have done would have made a difference, since I could do with a little extra stock of stock if need be. But at the same time, the more I worked with KFC, the more I thought about this little nugget, which included buying them the largest, most expensive franchise in the world. As far as I could tell, KFC had taken over a million dollars worth of their stock at that point. I felt bad, because I hadn't realized what this small slice of the pie meant to me. KFC knew what they were doing and they wanted to use it as a good way to get more money out of the company. It was also something that made me sad.\nI think I went through a \"bigger mess\" than the first 3 or 4 years I found myself working on KFC. My life got in the way, and that's what KFC has done for me. It's done it like a charm, and it's been doing it for many years before I even realized it was possible. The business is strong, but I still feel completely hopeless. I feel like I'm trying to quit, because all I know is what people tell me I didn't even know is my life. No one's telling me I didn't quit; there's no telling me that I was. The only thing that makes me realize it is that when you are going through this, you shouldn't try to quit because you have something that could help you in any other way at all.\nIf I made less money in the days before I left KFC, I would do it again, because I thought I had found my true purpose. But I had only started working on KFC for about 2 years before I found myself doing something that I thought would help us out. The job changed over time, and I'm sure I would've done it again as well, but I was so angry about what I felt. I was so afraid.\nKFC is huge on talent. It makes so many more people happy. I just have to believe that the next two years will be all mine.\nI'm an owner now that there's enough time to get ready for the new year, and I love my job. If you're a regular customer of a new franchise that's about to close, please feel free to contact me at custard@kfl.ca\nI'm sorry if you don't see it in your mind, but I wanted to share with you a photo of how I was able to take over my KFC business as a former employee of KFC. I was working at a franchise in a KFC outlet in Edmonton, Canada. I left to start work as a new employee when I was offered leave by my former employer, KFC. I don't remember how I managed to find my way back again until the last few months.\u00a0 KFC is so full of people, and so dedicated to us customers who are willing to serve the most customers in the world.

{"id":1211,"ended":false,"length":751,"gen_text":"As of April 2016, Vistara's Airbus A320 @ - @ 200s do not have in @ - @ flight entertainment screens installed and it provides pre @ - @ loaded tablets for its passenger & crew entertainment. This is true @ - @ on all seats.\n\n'The @ flight entertainment is available for all @ customer & guest seats provided for everyone to use @ @ - @ as they please.'\n\nAfter that, the original @ flight entertainment had been removed after Vistara agreed to buy all three seats, replacing each aisle, and adding them to the newly purchased seats.\n\n\nAt the new @ flight seat price we're happy with the price, with more seats available for $50 less than at previous price for @ @ original @ flight seats with a 4K monitor installed. If you want more, we currently have additional @ flight seats available with $500+ extra in prices.\n\n\nAs with all other @ flight entertainment displays, passengers can turn away from the new @ flight seats with their own choice of an option. We also now have option options based on usage habits during the flight, including a 'Turn Away, Open Seat', 'Turn Off and on' option.\n\n\nYou can set a number of times after you exit or begin your journey to get information from @ flight management where you want to turn. When your turn, which will last for an hour, is finished then your departure destination is indicated 'Off'. You can then go to your departure destination and continue on to your destination of choice at any time.\n\nWhen a seat is removed from @ flights or you stop boarding, check the seat to make sure seating is complete and that you're available to board before you depart. You then have to return to the original seats you're using, as they are now boarded with your seat. Once a seat has been removed, passengers can return your seat to your seat if needed (as long as they are wearing their seat). The seat that is returned will not be yours to return.\n\n\nIn our view it is safest to leave your seat on the last seat available, if you leave it next to an exit station, your car, luggage or any other item at the gate before departure. If you leave your seat next to any items or things outside your vehicle without having a seat, you should immediately get back on your vehicle. If you leave your seat next to any items outside your vehicle, they'll then have the option to return to your seat to pick them up or to park them safely.\n\nWhen leaving your seat and returning to the seat you were sitting on, people who are currently passengers can turn the switch off. You can also check your car with your smartphone and your luggage, while you exit our platform.\n\n\nYou'll still be able to enjoy all of our @ flight entertainment (except for the new @ flight seats) on your daily basis, which will be available at any time after your departure destination. If you take a bus, you no longer need a @ flight entertainment to get around LAX in the near future!\n\n\nSince @ flight entertainment is an in-flight interface, as with any of our products, passengers can choose to have their passengers have their access to the @ flight entertainment. If you would like your passengers to have a ticket for you at the gate and you want your passengers to have access to your @ flight entertainment, you can use any of our onboard services to leave the @ flight entertainment or use your own seat or buy it on behalf of an official. (The @ airline ticketing information provided by @ flightmanagement is based on your actual passenger purchase preferences and can add value to the ticket.

{"id":2478,"ended":false,"length":668,"gen_text":"An Internet radio show to promote the anime series was broadcast between October 5, 2006 and March 27, 2008 called the Seio Girls'Academy Broadcasting Station ( < unk >, < unk >, < unk > ).\n\n\nIt began airing on February 16, 2007 in Nendoroid Japan and KANJU: BONUS DISAPPEARANCE - a comedy radio show based on Anime Channel's story.\n\nStory [ edit ]\n\nThe protagonist of the show is an older woman named Bintaro Yukihiro, who is on her way to save the world when she falls behind. The show focuses on the various anime channels who offer various services including various types of service on various services.\n\n\nYukihiro starts off the program with a cute girl calling her by her first name, Naoto. Despite being small in comparison to her average height, she has amazing hair and even likes to throw things during the show, such as the most annoying thing she does, her hand being placed at her throat, which she does at the end. Naoto then takes the show's opening theme, \"Reimu!\" as her favourite song on the program and shows a lot of adorable anime cute lines.\n\nTo prevent her from doing anything serious, Yukihiro goes to her favorite channel to play her favorite anime characters (such as Shoukou Kanou) as well as their voice characters. She then plays the theme song from \"The World's Favorite Anime\".\n\n\nIn February 2005, Bintaro Yukihiro's mom took Yuuko Shurihi to the Academy to train. After Yuuko's train, Yukihiro takes Yuuko back to her parents and introduces the rest of the characters on the show, including Yuuko's character, Yuta Urao, a boy with very long hair who is very cute and who even is able to put her hands in her pockets. Yuuko is then led to believe the show will work!\n\nFrom July 2006, the episode's premiere was aired when Yukihiro took Yuuko to the Academy. However, she did not want to risk their school life after hearing from her parents. Yukihiro made Yuuko feel very sad and asked Yuuko how she felt.\n\nWhen Naoto comes over to see her, she realizes Yukihiro is only 13 and has been in high school and can remember just a little bit about where she came from. They now know why Naoto came in first.\n\nYukihiro eventually finds her parents in Japan. She has been waiting for someone to call her home before going out. She gets back to her parents and finds that Nanna has left, but she refuses to leave. Yukihiro tells her that she should just let her stay home.\n\nWhen Nanna was called to show off the final episodes, \"Unk,\" her mother was angry. She told her how she felt because, despite being a junior, she was always a teacher and never to give in. She was also sad that her life was taken from her because of her father's \"good intentions.\" Nanna was furious with Naoto for not stopping the show. Naoto's mom then called her to remind her that she couldn't do \"good\" either way. When Nanna finally shows up, Nanna told her she was sick and Nanna said she deserved to die.

The major differences were the need for increased speed for fast takeoff and landing, and for better handling of the aircraft.\n\n- to. In 1937, a contract was awarded for using Grumman helicopters for training and training during the Second World War. In addition, during the early 1940s, the Grumman aircraft were used for training and reconnaissance operations, but no significant military program was undertaken after the war. This led to the creation of the Boeing Company of Detroit, where one jet was made for each major test area.\n\n-. A pilot's report prepared for use as a draft document by the United States Air Force during the 1941 Civil War in the USAAF's Training Branch, U.S. Navy, indicates the Grumman and the P-53 could perform both, and there are a number of aircraft available.\n\n, stated some of the key elements of a 'B' jet pilot are in line with the aircraft of the aircraft's type.

By the end of 1944, the first 'B' aircraft aircraft, the P-61A, had become a full-size Air Force aircraft, but with an older and smaller P-40A in the wing.\n\n, the 'B' aircraft aircraft, the 'B' aircraft, saw many operations during the '41-'45 War in Europe, where the 'B' jet used for airborne training was only limited to the second combat mission, but during that phase its use became commonplace.\n\nSources, Sources of Information on Air Force Aircraft.\n\n(Bibliography:\n\n(P.

{"id":4115,"ended":false,"length":682,"gen_text":"The video is set to tell the story of a samurai @ - @ in @ - @ training, who falls in love with her master while a jealous peer fights for his affection, & learns to respect others for what they give him, & can sometimes even turn his own attention to others. This would have also been a perfect time to break-up in the anime, as she is the main character on the show.\n\nAnother person who had similar things happen with this is the girl.\n\nIt is stated that she is in love with her Master and then she falls for him in the scene.\n\nIt is said that she will leave her master alone.\n\nA character with a very common name is known as a \"futurama kurana saku\". She is a student at the school's \"Love School\", but is shown to have a deep love for her rival.\n\nThis trope can also be found in some other fan and anime.\n\nIn Homura, Shigeru Miyamoto and Atsuko Miyawaki made some of the most famous movies with female characters. Also, Tetsuya Nomura and Ayaka Matsuri from Yu-Gi-Oh! were women.\n\nTabletop Games\n\nWarhammer 40,000 has the \"Mighty Women of Warhammer 40,000\" rule set, as well as a female protagonist.\n\nThe \"Dragon Knights\" series are the main type of male players.\n\nMass Effect's main female hero Shepard makes an appearance here due to that fact as well, and she's a playable character within the DLC to the previous-season of Mass Effect Andromeda.\n\nFan works tend to give their characters a \"female\" title for characters on their lists, as they often are male characters, giving the female character the appearance of their female self.\n\nFan Works\n\nIn Marvel Vs. Capcom, the title for a female main character is Meryl Lee, the most likely to be a direct female character in this case, since it can only be assumed that the main female villain will be that one.\n\nOn the fan's part, it was revealed that when one of the main antagonists of Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 (which isn't her real name) decided to change her appearance, he changed her hair, but it didn't seem to be one of the things that affected her at all, instead just being on the off chance that it would interfere with her fighting style\u2026\n\nFilm\n\nIn T.S. Eliot's, it is suggested that some of the character's most powerful abilities are that of the warrior spirit.\n\nLiterature\n\nLive-Action TV\n\nMythology\n\nIn John Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the famous \"Hitchhiker\" is a female character in the story of Abraham Lincoln \"who is the most powerful man in the world\", a title bestowed by King Jowett, who became a powerful leader in the Revolutionary War.\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien, author of The Silmarillion of Gondor, was a woman in Tolkien's short stories, but in The Godfather, the story's most famous character changes to a black girl of the New World, although Tolkien's character was not a slave in the matter.\n\nWestern Animation\n\nIn Star Trek Season 5's end credits, the \"Hitches,\" from the episode \"Time of Living on Your Surface\" (a phrase which was

{"id":4901,"ended":true,"length":696,"gen_text":"The old wooden railway station, Estaci\u00f3n Pichilemu, constructed around 1925, is one of the National Monuments of Chile. In the O 'Higgins Region, 357 kilometres ( 222 mi ) of mountain range in the northeastern part of Chile, it is named Pichilemu, for Picacio 'Higgins' and Picacio 'Hunga' for 'Ice'. Picacio 'Hunga' is the Latin name for the 'Great Bear' who was said to have crossed his land and is worshipped today.\n\nThe National Monument on the Cemeco National Park is called Pichilemu in the Spanish New World, being one of the biggest national monuments in the world. In the US, the National Monument on the US National Mall is called the National Mall of Pichilemu, an homage to President Theodore Roosevelt. The National Mall, named after the Spanish Civil War icon and military legend, is located in Chicago's Little Italy. The park opened in 1948, and the new Pichilemu is part of the National Park.\n\nPichilemu, called Pichulo, derives from P\u00edci\u00f3n de la Pochola (Pachileo), the meaning of the Latin word, meaning 'hill of the sea'.\n\nThe most famous of the National Parks in the world is the National Park of Bolivia, which is located on the border of Bolivia and Peru. It is famous as 'the Great Snow White', as well as for its huge snowflakes on both the Pacific Ocean and Great Plains.\n\nThe most popular National Park in the world is that of El Dorado National Park in Chile, which is named after President Santiago 'El Arco' Santiago, who went as a young man to study medicine on his grandfather's ranch in this part of Chile. El Dorado is the oldest National Park in the world in Chile, located near Campos National Park, where President Cristina 'Cristina' Santiago was elected for the first time in 1976.\n\nEl Dorado is where the famous mountains and glaciers of Peru are located, as well as famous for the fact that they are the tallest mountain range, which was the highest on Earth in 1950.\n\nIt is the center of the famous glaciers of North America. The glaciers are the largest snowglobals ever seen in the world. When they melt, they cause glaciers to break apart and form ice sheets that break up on the world's oceans and lakes. They also provide many useful photosynthetic energy to the snow.\n\nThese glaciers, known as \"ice glaciers\", melt at about 15,000 kilometres an hour - more than five times faster than they melt on earth. Glaciers are also more common on the continents and have the biggest ice sheets in the world. During all of these periods, they are the biggest snow-climbing glaciers on the planet.\n\nDuring the Earth's past, most of the world did not have the chance to have an ice age - and yet in a way no one ever really did. Even by Earth's most advanced technologies, they were barely detectable for almost 400 million years - making them one of the most difficult and challenging periods in human history.\n\nIn fact, some experts believe that the last ice age in recorded history started in the 4th century AD, when the ice sheets were growing to more than 8 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures. After that the ice became thicker and colder, increasing the probability of glaciers starting to melt. The last ice age was achieved in 1978, when the world experienced the hottest summer on record (since 1850 ).\n\nOne can learn more about the conditions leading up to the last ice age on the planet

{"id":2309,"ended":true,"length":705,"gen_text":"Keswick's history throughout the 20th century was one of increasing reliance on tourism, the pencil industry being the second largest source of employment. The Cumberland Pencil Company, formed at the turn of the 20th century in the year 1810, worked with the likes of Robert Tilton and other influential musicians such as Charles Laughton and John Wyndham. The first production was performed by John Henry Anderson at the Cumberland Pencil Factory in 1823.\n\nThe early days of the Cumberland Pencil Company were marked by the publication of four editions of Samuel Rynge's The Seven Hundred and Two Men's Illustrations. The first of which was printed in 1828. In this edition, he portrayed nine prominent figures for the company, including the Governor with a horse, Baron Harkins with a pike, Lord Luthian, and Lord Percy with a pistol. The other editions were further expanded in 1839, and included illustrations by William Cuff, who later led the Pencil Club. It was there that the work was also featured in Charles Laughton : A Short Tale.\n\nAs with other Pencil Factory works, in this version of William Cuff's 1839 novel, a young man with a scarlet hat has his life taken over by an unhappy woman whom he has to kill to keep her silence ; this young man also goes so far as to try to get rid of the lady, while she is trying to make the relationship between him and her possible.\n\nBy the mid-20th century, the most prominent Pencil Factory in Britain had grown rapidly, but it had been struggling for almost two centuries at least, and had undergone considerable change during that time. The Company, then only a small business, had become dominated by a highly profitable group of \"professional\" manufacturers at the beginning of the 20th century, a group that included prominent artists of that time such as Alfred Russel Wallace. The young man had succeeded in creating the large American Pencil Factory, which was now headed by Samuel Rynge's Robert Bales, after having given his life for the company for which he was paid.\n\nThe Company, which was founded in 1823 and operated until 1825, would soon be under the command of Henry Anderson (1838-79) as its chief commercial driver. Robert Bales, who was born in 1836, began to have a noticeable effect on the company. He became the executive chairman after Anderson's death in 1846. His son, William Henry Anderson (1847-1853), was appointed president in August 1856.\n\nThe company was once called the Balfour Company, but it soon found that there were two things going against its name: (1) it wanted to remain independent of the American Union, (2) it wanted to remain British (that is, to remain in the Union at least for the next two centuries), and (3) it wanted a British influence in the company, but no one outside the U.S. could understand why the balfour company was so unpopular with the English.\n\nThis is perhaps the most bizarre of all of the \"carte blanche\" claims put forward by members of the Balfour Company. It seems almost absurd, of course, to think that if the company was not already well known, why not just keep its name in Britain when it had been around a long time? This is a huge contradiction in the minds of people as diverse as Richard Burton, Charles Darwin, Sir Richard Branson, John Dew, Lord Stanley, Sir Andrew Jackson, Sir Anthony Grant, Arthur Morris, and

According to the movie 'N' B', the lead actor was Thaarif Ghansali because he had worked with Dr. Khaalgam and Ghansali-Ghansali was not a part of the team. In the opening scene where Ghansali said that her husband wasn't aware of the rape allegations he made against him and that he might have to step down because of the threat, Thaarif was actually referring to being a member of the Khalsa which was one thing and the sexual abuse he had made against him for years was another.\n\n. according to the movie 'N' B', the lead actor was because he had worked with Dr. Khaalgam and Ghansali-Ghansali was not a part of the team. In the opening scene where Ghansali said that her husband wasn't aware of the rape allegations he made against him and that he might have to step down because of the threat, Thaarif was actually referring to being a member of the Khalsa which was one thing and the sexual abuse he had made against him for years was another. The plot to give the story some depth: The first story (takes place only a few hundred years before the events of 'N' B' ) is an account of Khurana's birth on a lunar moon at the end of time. It is based on a line in the Mahabharata where an elder says to a woman, \"This place is like a cave.\" The book further says, \"This place was the birthplace of Nauru and was inhabited by the Khalsa.\" This is the location mentioned in the Mahabharata which was used in the Book of Exodus: (Tract. 22a.3-4): \"If those whom the name Khurana says about you be living in this place then you ought to stay there. Those who live there should be ashamed for the fact of having been born there; they should not have any other place to live. They ought rather to live in the cave.\" (A.H. 2b.14) There you have the key element of Khurana being a goddess and he is actually born to be a man who has killed his wife and has the power to kill women but also to die. The Book further states that \"if those whom she spoke about with anger, angering, or hatred, are living in this place then they should not live there.\" What does this say about Khurana who really is a warrior, a woman (if he does not believe in the Bible it says that he is a warrior, a woman (not a man)), and that he is a warrior of Nauru? (A.H. 2b.14) This is the only description of Khurana in terms of being a warrior in our day.\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nHarrison, Robert (2009) Khurana as Menace to the Indian War: The Tale of Khurana-Amani (Anthropology Press, 2011).\n\nMammootty, R.

{"id":4394,"ended":false,"length":669,"gen_text":"Everest became one of the `` Cool Britannia `` tailoring generation of the mid @ - @ 1990s, identified by James Sherwood ( author of Savile Row : The Master Tailors of British Bespoke Fashion '85, in which he is quoted as stating, `` The Royal Bespoke-Chanel was one of the most memorable of the great Bespoke-crazed, British Fashion shows of the sixties and seventies. It has become one of the most successful shows of its decade of existence. With this in mind, the show, which at one stage was ''The King's Visit'' and later was '' The King's Visit: A Fashioner's Story with the President of the US Federal Reserve Act,'' came out for only seven years into the second season last July. The premiere of Savile Row, now at the Center Plaza New York, shows what the future has in store for the Royal Bespoke-Chanel, which will be in the form of its newest new couture line. As part of its continuing effort to bring modern style to the modern world, the show has teamed up with its iconic ''Bespoke\"-style tailoring brand ''Yogu.\" It's not yet clear whether the fashion brand will produce the full range of products (including full-length jackets, shirts, hats, etc.), but some elements of its line will already be in use. Savile Row will debut its latest fashion line, featuring new styles, in the summer of 2017.\n\nSavile Row Season 3 at the Center Plaza New York, June 1\n\nTaken from New York Review of Books, July 7, 2017.\n\nThis edition is published under the NRC's Commercial Affairs program, and is republished under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 U.S. License.

Please read the comments on this article for a detailed review of what the current production schedule actually means.)\n\nI wish to acknowledge the many people who have written comments for the past three years in this column; here, it was David Shilton who wrote:\n\nI would like to thank all the people who commented with me. The work of the original writers, all of whom are my mentors, were very inspiring and had many profound impact. I also wish to thank the amazing cast of producers, crew and models that made their debut in this collection of photos. I would also like to thank the amazing cast who, working as \"models\" to make this collection work, were very appreciative and helpful. Thank you -- and thank you -- for your hard work!\n\nThis is not our first time to collaborate on the creative side of the show. After spending a year working as the co-writer and producer of the original ''A Song for the King'' for TMA, I decided that it would be time for a new level of collaboration and a new approach to production. Thus, there are many unique opportunities to share information online and collaborate on projects together, in a new way. It would be great to have these projects with you!

{"id":1166,"ended":false,"length":748,"gen_text":"Reviewing the film, The Hindu wrote : `` An out and out action flick, one can see the director's thirst to cash in on the audience craze for such films. Nevertheless, 'Nappa' is a true comedy of satire, with the actors and their respective jokes being able to make up for any misunderstandings and lack of substance.'- The story begins at the age of six and ends with an inter-racial wedding in Kolkata of ten men after which they marry the girl.\n\nIt is a satire about racial differences where he shows a man and a woman taking pictures in the street while wearing the same clothing. This joke will leave many people reeling. To this day, I am never able to appreciate Hindi cinema since it is a unique medium. A few of us found our way to it by reading the articles on the subject.\n\nIt has to be said that this movie has received critical critical praise, but it also had the opposite quality of a typical movie about the rise and fall of an Indian woman. We have seen many films about a woman so many of the films have shown a female hero. I couldn't help but laugh at this. A woman's power should not be ignored, however, when dealing with a black actor.\n\nBut it is a film where the protagonists fall through the cracks and try to get their point across. The film has a strong comedic attitude and the characters can be genuinely funny. My personal favorite is Tushar, the girl who is portrayed the same way in the film. When a black woman tries to get in touch with an older man, he gets away like a hot-dog and he is able to escape with a large group of white, black and non-stop men.\n\nThe plot of the film consists of a girl and her cousin, Pashtish in the middle of the Sahara. She is a young girl and her cousin is a black man who has been accused of murdering her for money and a few other cases. After several attempts at persuading the girls to join with him, Pashtish refuses them any chance. However, she does have something that will help her in her marriage.\n\nWhen her cousin is shot at by a group of white men in her home, she cries and tears as you can hear the gun chime off. The fact that the action is all narrated by a black man is also great. The cinematography doesn't suffer after all but its acting is really impressive. The action in this movie is not easy to follow with every body movement as you will also encounter a man fighting with a white man who is obviously trying to get her back and they both fight with him back and so on.\n\nThis film is a perfect example of the way to move the plot. It's a great story about the struggle that the black man can show on the black man's head in real life. A man cannot hide his own true face, the beauty, the courage, the innocence and the soul of a black man. The movie portrays a beautiful scene where a very angry man goes against the white man to get back at him and to win her back. There is plenty of scenes as the black man is fighting with the white man while also showing his power of breaking black women's hearts and making them see black history.\n\nIt's a picture that shows the depth of Indian cinema. We saw a video in which the protagonist's life was turned upside down by him. We can watch every action of him. The scene is also great as the fight that takes place is not so serious.

{"id":2638,"ended":true,"length":759,"gen_text":"The closing ceremony of the Paralympic Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded. Flag @ - @ bearers from each participating country enter, followed by the athletes who enter together, and the flag bearer that finishes the ceremony\n\nHere's a short version of how this happens:\n\nWith all the teams competing individually across the world, for-profit companies have a strong monopoly on everything from building new stadiums to opening arenas for football and basketball. As part of this, they pay the IOC to have the Olympic stadium installed on site, paying them a hefty fine that can exceed $1 billion in the case of a stadium being built in Brazil. In other words, the IOC doesn't pay their sports teams because they don't want to pay athletes who do. At this point, what they want to do is create more money. As a result, the IOC's Olympic Stadium Initiative is funded via public funds with little public notice. In recent years, this has been happening with the opening of Olympic-style stadiums, with some being completely closed and others being opened after a massive storm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what exactly does this mean?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe IOC's new Stadium Initiative was a direct response to the Olympics' global collapse when it was introduced in 1998. On its website, the initiative mentions that all 50 members of the IOC (the US, Germany, Iceland, Australia, Canada, and Russia) have been forced out of the sport:\n\nThe World Games are held the same year over and over again. They represent more than 50 nations, from New Zealand to South Korea, each participating in two different games each year. Each of these games is held in different cities, including Australia and New Zealand. In 2018, Australia announced a commitment to hosting the 2018 Paralympics at the Olympic Stadium, which is in the South Pacific nation of Brazil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis may seem like a huge development for a country that has so many different sporting events to choose from. After all, the Olympics have been held in many different cities. And given that this is an Olympics that will take place almost every year, that could help it not get so far behind. But if something like this happens, and the Olympic Stadium isn't fixed, what'll we do about it?\n\nThe IOC isn't exactly happy with just any country. That is certainly the case with Canada. While the Canadian government has taken the unprecedented step of using the Olympics to protect its country, they have found that it's not taking the Games seriously enough, and are putting in some of their own people who are currently living in the same housing as the athletes. They are also trying to figure out a way of ensuring the country doesn't lose any of the money the Olympic Stadium Initiative is funded for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also seems bizarre that the Canadian government chose to create this policy. The real concern may be if this turns out to be a very effective way to reduce costs, and if the federal government decides to invest heavily in the Olympics for the sake of saving money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is perhaps also why the idea of putting private money behind sporting events (including football championships) seems so silly. Perhaps the most important thing about this move is that it isn't a new initiative. The Olympic teams were already well known to the public (including players). So why put money into things that aren't even in the public eye? That's a shame, given the fact that it's only a country with a history of national politics (or, at least, a very friendly past with the Olympics) that decided to build the Stadium Initiative for their sport. But it seems like it should be a good move. It's still an Olympic campaign with great potential of a lot of money to be made. Until then, maybe it's just just a ploy to promote something that's already working rather well for themselves.","token_len":797,"entropy":[9.7493,4.1775,1.4156,0.3694,7.7516,0.0003,0.4854,0.1014,5.2876,0.0121,5.7735,5.2467,9.3874,0.2284,3.7667,1.9109,0.7657,10.6668,11.6094,9.11,3.4102,9.733,6.1402,6.6618,4.3747,5.0424,0.4831,6.7287,4.2532,7.4426,0.0292,1.3027,4.0181,2.6038,5.3309,6.2507,2.5585,1.6596,1.5744,3.7534,3.8345,5.2724,5.4975,1.1558,1.384,4.3401,0.0019,5.8009,1.1519,1.2916,4.0477,5.4237,0.1375,3.2829,3.4887,3.576,0.7249,0.9159,0.0002,5.7181,3.1757,0.9329,5.3553,2.5194,4.9813,6.0008,0.7471,0.8944,0.3862,6.1734,6.0151,0.1835,1.7267,2.8955,2.2221,3.993,4.5491,0.4467,5.4983,0.8075,5.7396,3.7503,0.8166,0.5414,5.2703,5.0934,2.4368,3.6782,1.4847,1.6256,0.8092,3.5007,4.1519,0.0011,1.5393,1.2549,1.3995,4.1778,2.7569,3.0776,1.4373,4.0632,1.3433,4.0407,3.8989,5.3458,2.645,3.5878,1.595,6.228,2.4562,2.2725,4.3954,4.3412,3.9693,2.3993,3.4807,0.5325,1.8867,1.2244,3.722,1.6769,2.7756,0.1013,1.1187,2.2809,3.3251,0.8175,1.5522,3.5317,0.4907,3.445,2.8918,0.0416,0.0579,1.5807,0.3577,3.8235,0.0005,2.3588,4.5787,4.4146,1.7949,5.2931,0.8637,2.0916,0.0005,1.1455,0.4984,2.0353,5.5615,2.481,4.4554,2.4637,5.8619,3.1685,0.1806,0.2151,5.5773,2.9945,1.9835,0.9691,0.1311,0.1186,3.5016,3.6461,3.076,3.3303,4.2859,2.0107,0.2214,0.1607,1.4235,0.4687,3.1648,3.6302,1.6341,5.0585,1.8454,4.7018,4.9702,3.9129,1.6279,4.983,4.8364,3.72,4.709,0.8115,3.4631,5.5583,0.0982,0.0941,2.9005,0.6012,1.9633,3.5408,2.4456,1.2407,5.0285,0.3833,3.1774,5.1679,1.8243,0.8189,2.533,2.4544,3.5228,4.7713,5.5868,3.6676,2.5897,0.376,1.4035,1.8176,4.7331,2.3602,4.7838,5.5279,0.9357,0.9739,0.0002,4.538,0.2176,0.0002,2.3272,0.0015,0.0001,3.4469,2.7519,4.3688,1.7177,0.6478,0.9676,1.2123,1.5682,0.0001,4.3802,0.0006,0.0001,2.0261,0.7492,1.9346,3.8641,3.1591,0.1645,4.0028,3.6006,4.7888,1.364,0.02,0.7943,4.0113,1.8357,5.8537,4.4274,4.6853,1.7485,1.2197,5.086,0.6919,4.0853,0.4246,5.863,2.3788,1.4052,0.1412,0.4191,2.3907,5.8338,1.1747,4.7836,5.0924,4.6134,0.1766,0.1211,0.9882,4.5253,2.1039,3.3632,0.1856,3.1038,0.0132,6.6777,0.0481,4.0323,0.0756,2.202,0.0835,1.4291,2.9255,0.0833,1.6491,2.6234,3.2685,2.3771,0.3599,0.8473,2.2137,5.009,0.4108,0.0002,1.4234,4.4624,2.3,2.5911,4.5321,5.8826,3.2027,0.5246,6.697,1.9438,0.163,0.4642,1.2339,4.3929,5.4103,4.1898,0.2024,2.9468,2.1823,1.3749,2.8776,5.5307,0.2225,0.1952,2.8518,0.708,0.8303,4.3717,4.2853,0.1975,4.0618,2.565,3.3426,2.2513,0.1643,0.3595,2.936,1.9234,0.7109,0.8188,1.2905,1.7814,0.9204,2.4421,2.6862,1.2786,4.5351,5.6871,1.72,0.9281,0.0375,0.6549,2.669,5.3956,0.2118,4.0767,5.4847,2.6982,4.9716,0.2325,2.7552,0.8132,1.763,1.9225,0.0001,1.5943,3.4328,1.049,1.9766,0.4077,2.2242,1.8676,1.7478,3.7131,2.2186,3.4667,1.3394,4.3561,0.146,5.6615,0.2735,1.7337,0.0002,0.558,0.0011,0.0001,3.2418,5.4486,1.3183,0.5245,0.408,3.1099,5.0598,1.9266,1.4109,1.6485,0.8547,1.3529,5.0114,1.558,4.0145,2.8197,0.5804,1.2966,1.605,0.0181,0.9983,4.3904,0.0513,0.0166,1.7209,1.5563,2.264,1.0216,1.1139,0.9369,3.7723,0.4881,0.744,2.7203,2.7407,5.12,0.9762,3.75,0.8711,2.9738,2.5996,2.1375,2.9406,1.9253,0.1502,5.0151,1.0179,0.4785,0.639,3.7034,3.423,5.0928,4.0568,5.5584,3.5187,2.9139,2.5225,3.0641,1.1555,1.9065,3.2105,5.0193,1.1522,0.1588,0.8466,0.5532,3.1187,1.2885,3.3258,0.4113,6.767,0.0002,4.8352,0.5497,2.3436,6.1276,3.7774,1.476,1.9941,0.051,0.0414,0.4707,0.0002,2.6088,1.0478,4.0179,0.0005,4.3967,3.622,0.6177,5.2803,2.7617,3.5535,2.6578,5.6767,3.268,5.3317,1.6915,0.3341,0.8476,4.1208,1.0955,3.8207,1.0099,2.6636,0.4245,1.116,4.1335,2.1061,3.6213,0.0624,0.0305,5.1978,1.3597,2.5489,0.7832,4.9659,1.1265,5.2295,2.0702,2.1536,1.2759,5.1819,1.4739,2.2141,1.9787,1.7547,5.2406,1.7196,3.2927,0.697,0.1788,2.6559,0.9339,2.6527,4.7773,3.307,4.8339,2.6078,2.4172,0.1707,4.2644,1.8743,1.581,5.3344,4.8456,0.6663,1.7802,2.17,4.3431,0.5787,0.7789,1.4642,0.6331,3.4423,1.6983,1.759,2.3274,0.0318,4.8964,0.0092,2.7034,0.1389,3.8449,4.5707,2.5075,4.6023,1.474,0.0003,2.4952,3.1234,0.8627,0.9344,2.1797,3.3581,2.5788,0.6839,0.2618,1.815,3.0098,2.3937,0.5557,0.821,0.0002,0.6784,0.0018,0.0001,3.6664,4.9847,0.9884,6.4746,0.4026,0.9866,2.5467,0.1272,5.6474,0.2955,4.7936,1.8496,4.9298,2.296,2.2294,5.7767,4.6499,4.5357,0.3821,3.689,2.5622,5.1191,0.4643,0.0399,0.028,1.0427,4.6726,3.0297,0.7583,0.848,4.8043,3.4653,2.3097,2.1816,2.4752,1.3183,4.1914,0.0414,2.5226,0.3559,3.5298,3.4669,0.2972,1.597,1.8224,4.1836,1.1969,1.9866,0.0013,3.8207,0.3785,0.9627,1.4534,0.0002,2.7301,0.0013,0.0001,3.4938,1.2,4.8705,5.1046,0.8726,1.0281,5.4333,0.295,2.898,5.8701,0.7518,2.3192,4.3327,0.0427,4.9459,4.3149,4.2771,8.0245,0.4745,1.8688,0.9312,3.7421,0.4741,5.0451,1.3794,3.832,1.9736,0.843,2.2614,1.6745,4.1723,0.4003,0.168,0.6597,5.0753,0.0003,2.7022,2.9691,2.8312,1.0119,1.6012,2.9328,6.4585,2.7847,1.3683,4.784,1.3692,1.7231,0.7273,1.161,4.301,3.5834,5.9645,4.1552,3.5681,1.7849,3.4428,2.0155,0.5724,5.3778,0.6203,2.381,0.0002,2.4433,3.537,0.5759,1.1196,1.7503,0.3927,4.4968,0.8927,1.9565,4.2614,1.1935,3.668,1.3191,1.7381,0.0386,2.6306,0.9353,3.8682,1.6558,6.3383,2.4965,0.9226,2.2015,0.0828,5.0355,5.2622,3.156

{"id":4164,"ended":false,"length":643,"gen_text":"Virginia Tech's defense likewise was more successful against opponents'rushing offense than their passing attack. Tech permitted an average of 99 @. @ 3 yards per game on the ground (and 2.0 yards per rush). The game was ultimately won 6-0, but due to the play of quarterback Alex Collins, the 'Banks defense actually lost to the 'Oilers 12-7 on the season.\n\n. Tech permitted an average of 9.4 points per game on the ground.\n\nThe 'Bans\n\nWhen ranked No. 1 nationally, Florida actually finished dead last in total defense, behind West Virginia Tech. On the other hand, the Seminoles were second, finishing with 8.5 for the season.\n\nThe Badgers led the nation with a defense averaging 98.5 points per game, a number more than any other team in the nation.\n\nThe Badgers also were ranked No. 4 in scoring defense from 2014-15, ranking 11th nationally. Only Clemson and UCLA -- ranked No. 7 and No. 14, respectively -- did not have fewer than ten scoring defenses. Also, while Clemson was ranked as the nation's No. 1 scorer on a per game basis last season, it ranked 17th when it allowed at least 20 points per game.\n\nIn the first quarter, the Badgers turned two long turnovers into seven points each on their own 23-yard line.\n\nIn the second quarter, despite the Seminoles' inability to stop the run, they got two short touchdowns on two of the game's biggest plays: three-and-one with 7:19 left-center and seven-and-a.-half seconds left. The Seminoles forced two field goals, one on a punt and one on a return by quarterback Ryan Griffin at the goal line, which led to the Seminoles completing 16 of 23 passes for 464 yards, two touchdowns and another TD. At the same time, the 'Bans gave up three field goals. The Seminoles scored on the fourth-and-11 at the Tallahassee 31, but Clemson could have prevented the turnovers. The game was tied at 3 until the 'Bans finally ran the ball three times in the second half.\n\nFlorida was ranked No. 2 in scoring defense, but lost to Florida State 7-0.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWith the Badgers still in the hunt, the Seminoles will return home to face No. 8 Ohio State on Sept. 20. As a result, the Buckeyes will be hosting Florida State in a home opener this September.\n\nThe Seminoles have five games left in this rivalry that will determine the national title of Florida State football. Florida State plays Michigan on Sept. 8 at Tampa Bay, Aug. 3 at home against Miami, Oct. 2 at Miami, Oct. 3 at Georgia, Oct. 4 at Texas A&M, Oct. 5 at Georgia Tech, Oct. 6 at TCU, Oct. 8 at Vanderbilt and Sept. 15 in the National Championship Game.\n\nThe Seminoles hosted the Aggies last season in the NCAA tournament for the first time. The 'Banks in 2002-03 were defeated by Florida State 38-14 to move to 8-7 and hold on for the national title.\n\nSince losing to the Seminoles last season, the Badgers have not won any games in the regular season except in the national championship game.\n\nFlorida State may play on Sept. 20 against the Seminoles again.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUPDATED 6TH TONIGHT: Seminoles host

{"id":2284,"ended":true,"length":761,"gen_text":"While control of the House of Representatives went over to the Republicans in the 112th Congress, the Senate stayed Democratic and McCain continued to be the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nIt was McCain who was eventually introduced to the nation's top Republican leadership for his vote in support of the Iran Nuclear deal, although those votes were for the measure in the House of Representatives as well as the other chambers.\n\n\"With this vote, [McCain] said and did the job. Now this will be a very good bill for this country,\" McCain told reporters Thursday. \"We're going to do what the Congress requires us to do so that it will pass. And this represents the best we can do.\"\n\nMcCain told the NBC News anchor, Rachel Maddow: \"The one thing I do want to say to the American people is that I will do everything I can to show this bill's bipartisan pass, which will ensure this goes through, and help advance the country's interests and, most importantly, the jobs here.\"\n\nEarlier this year, he said during the second Republican debate that he considered leaving the Senate for a higher position in the House, although he would not have said whether he had chosen to run for president in 2016.\n\nBut after his announcement, he asked the audience whether he would ever run again, which was the first question he had to ask on the campaign trail.\n\nNow, after his statement, McCain said: \"My vote is my life.\"\n\n\"We got two days to put this act together as effectively as we can -- that's the way it should work for Republicans at this time,\" he said.\n\nIt is not the first time that McCain has spoken out against his Republican opponent. When he was elected governor of Arizona in 2010, McCain defended a bill that was in the House which was supposed to prevent the sale of arms to Syria. But the House passed a different bill to make that part of the amendment illegal.\n\nMcCain said after the vote that he voted against allowing arming Syrian rebels, saying that he still wanted \"to talk about our shared values and principles.\"\n\n\"One thing I am sure about is that when the American people are tired of the war crimes that have been perpetrated by our government on innocent people, they should have seen my vote. The fact that millions of people across the world have now lost their right to vote has given them the freedom to move on,\" he said.\n\nIn October, McCain said he would not be leaving the Senate.\n\n\"I will never relinquish my position as someone who knows that I am going to work long and hard to prevent this legislation from passing and we will do all we can to reach a bipartisan solution,\" McCain told CNN's \"State Of The Union.\"\n\n\"It wasn't my choice to run, I know it was for the people of Arizona. I was elected, and I did ask that the people of Arizona see no shame in accepting my position,\" he added.\n\nWhen the House of Representatives convened to vote on the Iran nuclear deal in December of last year, McCain was expected to announce that he had won a two-thirds vote.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News' Brian Williams, McCain told Williams that \"it was a tough issue\" that needed \"to be resolved,\" to which Williams added that he had not been able to vote on the deal.\n\nAt the time, Democrats had hoped to support a resolution called the Violence Against Women Act. However, the motion, which passed in the Senate on September 12, was later blocked by a vote of 63 to 52.\n\nMcCain will begin his seventh term as senator in mid-2018 and is thought to be planning to retire on March 31, 2018 by the time the 2020 elections are held.\n\nMcCain was also slated to return to the Senate next year for a second

{"id":988,"ended":true,"length":755,"gen_text":"A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression east of Cape Verde on August 3. After six hours, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Connie. By August 4, Connie began to rapidly recede over the Bahamas in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIn the Atlantic\n\nThe eastern half of the Bahamas has been battered by severe winds and has become a swamp that often causes flooding.\n\nThis swamp is called an inter-bay lagoon. It consists of 5 m (3 ft) of concrete.\n\nIt is a very high flood plain where rivers flow at low tide. The lagoon is deep and deep, sometimes 20 m (30 ft) (27 in). There are a variety of inland habitats for fish but for most birds, the most common is a river. The lagoon is very large (~10 m wide by 20 m wide) and can be a great breeding ground for birds like jays.\n\nThis large island is considered to be some sort of protected area. It will be covered by several islands that are closed to navigation due to ongoing hurricanes. The island is said to contain three massive coral reefs. One of the biggest is the Coral Reef which is a shallow marine reef located on a secluded island that is home to numerous freshwater animals that have never been seen before.\n\nIn the Bahamas\n\nThis coral reef has been the most common place in the Bahamas to fish in the past. However, after four years there was a severe storm and severe heavy rain that made the life expectancy of many of the fisherman in this place miserable. The situation is becoming more and more dire over the last year, with winds and extremely windy weather causing damage in many areas.\n\nMore than 90% of the fishing done in the Bahamas is done in a single night and this is causing very serious damage. One fisherman, a large bald eagle, was killed in September when a hurricane occurred along the coast where he had been fishing. At this time of time, there was not much progress over the last two decades with the Bahamas getting less than 50 per cent of fish stocks going due to climate change during that time. The problem in the area over the last 12 months has been a lot more severe due to the intense storms.\n\nThe area was hit with storm surges during July which were as high as 40 metres. There were no deaths due to damage and some fish stocks began to be lost for years and years. The flooding has caused severe damage to coastal homes.\n\nAfter many years of working in this area, fishing in the area took quite an emotional toll. Many fishermen who had been lost had to make a decision that the best course of action was going to be to stay home and learn how to survive while doing it again for fear of being stranded again.\n\nThe only way to return to this place would be to have a big enough fishing boat, and bring enough food to feed thousands of people, many of whom are poor. Most fishermen take a bus from the village of Nambau to a fishing boat for every week in the Gulf of St. Lawrence which will then take them to the area of Nassau. Once there, they will take a short ferry ride to the area called the \"Vacation Inn\". They will also have snacks, drinks, and a place for breakfast.\n\nSome of the local fishermen who were stranded to work with the boats say they had been caught a good bit in the storm by the big storm, which dumped a huge amount of rain on Nassau and surrounding neighborhoods. There is also the fear of being stranded in this area to another country.\n\nThe Bahamas is a major destination for most people. The water on the beach where you enter the island is amazing, with a pool that will give you the best view.

{"id":4509,"ended":true,"length":732,"gen_text":"Though the storm remained over open waters after moving over the South China Sea, strong winds stemming from it fanned a large wildfire in Tai Lam Country Park, Hong Kong. At least three people died in that fire and others were injured in the neighboring province of Baidu -- in the northwestern half of the country -- police said.\n\nThe storm has also fueled tensions across a country that has seen some recent violence and unrest after the death of three of its citizens after a massive riot occurred during a protest movement in January.\n\nMore than 30 people were killed and at least 60 were wounded in four days of unrest after Chinese police unleashed water cannons on demonstrators in Tiananmen Square this week, raising fears that the country is looking for new scapegoats to blame for deepening the unrest.\n\nThe Chinese state news agency Xinhua says a large number of people in a government-run military camp have been killed in the past several days. The government said the situation is increasing and is ready to protect vulnerable citizens, as well as authorities.\n\nBut many say Chinese leaders have made some of the key decisions without consulting citizens.\n\n\"China is losing its ability to manage the situation,\" said Yang Zhongchun, who heads the National Development and Reform Commission (NBRC) of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), the ruling Communist Party's most powerful public body.\n\n\"I think these decisions are being made with the aim of protecting the people, and they are trying to mask the real problems of China.\"\n\nIn response to a report that the National People's Congress (NPC), China's top military body, will meet next week in Beijing, Mr Wang wrote that it would be impossible to \"take any concrete actions\" in order to avoid a worsening situation in the \"most turbulent time at my disposal\".\n\n\"The very real problem in China today isn't that of rising tension, where ordinary people are being murdered for no greater reason than those for the sake of national sovereignty,\" he wrote.\n\nImage caption People's Daily reported Friday's storm was the biggest ever seen by any country in China using an underwater volcano\n\nAccording to Xinhua, the storm has forced more than 400,000 people to flee the affected areas.\n\nChina has denied responsibility for the violence, blaming violence on its own security agencies. The ruling Beijing People's Political Commission (CCP) dismissed suggestions that the government has a role in the disaster, saying such an incident had been planned for some time beforehand.\n\nBut Chinese state media reported Friday, quoting a witness, that a new high level of police presence was called into the military camp.\n\nImage copyright AP Image caption Civilian casualties are high\n\nChina says the disaster was caused by Chinese authorities using two volcanoes, one of which blew up when an underwater volcano erupted there in 2009.\n\nThe Chinese state news agency Xinhua quoted Li Daohui, a former president of China's Communist Party, as saying local activists and protesters had hurled rocks and debris at the military camp ahead of the main unrest set to break out in the country.\n\nOfficials confirmed no political differences were at stake.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the 70,000 citizens who attended a rally demanding the disbandment of the government in January said they were angry with official statements regarding local leaders who were allegedly involved in the tragedy.\n\nThe demonstrators said a former former head of the NPP, Liu Zhenfei, had been found on state security property with the aid of explosives.\n\nThe latest unrest in China came to a head on Thursday, when hundreds of protesters clashed with police at major roads in the south of the country

{"id":2277,"ended":true,"length":729,"gen_text":"McCain set his sights on becoming a congressman because he was interested in current events, was ready for a new challenge, and had developed political ambitions during his time as Senate liaison.\n\nHowever, that career fell through when he was appointed to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee because he had worked on other things while also being employed as the acting CIA director to assist him in his new duties.\n\nBudget constraints kept him from participating in his senior duties and he was not aware when the job opened.\n\nIn 1986, he made four trips to Mexico City and then to Los Angeles. He made $40,000 for one trip. On two other occasions, he made more than $50,000.\n\nIn 1989, he became the second CIA director to give advice to a Senate aide: President George H.W. Bush, former President Richard Helms, and Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, former Assistant Secretary of Defense John Allen and Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Mary Harrick.\n\nIn December of that year, he also gave advice to Rep. Ed Ruben Fleischmann (D-Mich.) during a House Judiciary Committee hearing, as well as to House Intelligence Chairman Peter King (D-Iowa).\n\nAnd in his first months as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Joseph Dunford, became known as the \"one man army\" for carrying out missions without any formal training or experience.\n\nHe left President Harry H. Truman in December 1989 because he could not carry out tasks without the support of a senior CIA official, and because he felt pressured to act on his own.\n\nIt is not clear if, then, Deputy Director General Jim McGahon was aware of Deputy Director General Jim McGahon being an active U.S. Ambassador to Mexico City to which the Senate had previously approved a request for his appointment. But the House Intelligence Committee indicated this to McGahon on April 6, 1989.\n\nMcCain's work in Washington did not directly relate to the CIA. In 1989, he was hired by the White House to work as a CIA consultant at the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nAccording to the Library of Congress biography, McNeill served as a top deputy to Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, and Secretary of Defense Jim McNerney. He had one notable meeting with President George H.W. Bush just a few weeks before the September 11, 2001 attacks and was asked to discuss the importance of preparing Americans for attack.\n\nMcCain's role in the CIA was a high level level liaison to Rice, Rice's staff and his office. The CIA is not known for providing training or intelligence, however, and the White House has denied any knowledge that it assisted or participated in training or advising Rice or other officials.\n\nOther career CIA officials, who did not provide the Library of Congress with any records of their professional relationships with the CIA, were hired by Congress, and no records indicate that any CIA personnel or individuals were in the intelligence services at the time of McNeill's hire, in 1988 or 1989. It is possible that one person was in the intelligence services at the time his appointment was made.\n\nMcCain has not provided any records of his CIA career on which to base a position and no documents are known to have been made public because the Library of Congress requested them only after a former Director General, in 1999, was identified as a leading person who could present problems for the CIA.\n\nThe Library of Congress is providing additional information to this story to serve as a starting point for those who can access other sources for information.\n\nIn addition to the Library of Congress archives, the U.S. Government Accountability Office has provided other news service and documents to the authors regarding the CIA. The authors request the Library of Congress retain and include any copies of the CIA information and documents at all government archives.","token_len":799,"entropy":[6.9928,8.1771,2.7365,0.3617,0.1846,3.8993,1.6904,4.8164,5.107,0.9258,2.1989,4.5211,0.0289,8.591,1.3041,1.8076,6.3922,5.8881,2.3512,1.495,3.7199,1.9375,1.1711,0.3044,2.6443,6.1593,5.8841,3.2731,5.5232,0.5951,1.4324,1.135,5.313,7.6176,1.7552,1.109,0.0005,4.8419,0.0395,4.9769,4.8215,5.3123,2.4575,1.4184,0.879,1.4747,3.1243,0.9236,0.7222,1.5434,2.1165,0.0086,0.0857,5.5008,1.0949,1.9529,4.8635,1.9401,4.644,5.3444,4.1697,4.8941,1.725,5.0706,1.1968,3.1161,4.0094,4.507,0.2895,5.2449,4.0712,4.7349,1.0788,1.53,3.8661,3.128,0.1972,0.598,0.0003,5.4939,5.7769,3.7526,4.4342,0.6941,1.0846,5.1081,0.1395,3.1342,5.3634,3.6856,2.4427,1.3429,1.3566,3.3034,4.964,5.1457,2.338,4.608,3.5756,1.1046,0.762,0.0002,2.746,5.9713,0.1773,1.8027,4.5001,5.7303,0.9995,0.2017,3.9341,2.6532,2.4005,3.3081,1.8604,2.7996,0.0689,2.1883,1.0871,3.7181,4.8867,4.2484,0.1071,0.0856,2.8883,4.333,0.5073,1.5906,4.5398,3.4444,3.121,2.228,0.5182,0.2355,1.5895,1.761,0.1358,0.3226,2.4192,0.0032,0.0013,0.9,0.3858,0.0002,2.1169,3.3388,0.1344,0.5047,3.8822,1.2462,3.1049,3.5091,0.3098,0.4202,5.7083,4.9858,0.5513,1.9262,3.2842,2.9638,5.0752,5.0481,2.6706,0.2817,0.0029,0.2786,0.0017,0.0014,1.8885,4.3821,2.4745,2.547,6.2011,0.0006,0.8021,0.6804,4.6145,0.0356,1.7075,4.9525,0.0256,0.0097,0.0186,2.117,3.464,3.9816,0.2545,0.1552,0.8713,3.4462,3.9177,1.5121,5.701,3.9631,0.2106,3.1443,4.6783,3.0146,5.921,0.4517,0.1605,0.0002,1.8923,4.8681,2.4737,0.7246,0.0439,0.0438,1.1934,4.1938,1.8443,0.8827,0.0875,4.7287,0.0077,5.3698,6.2399,1.7246,5.0154,0.5342,0.4189,1.3705,0.5805,0.042,2.5433,1.2136,3.884,1.0232,2.661,1.8705,0.269,0.1318,2.6439,3.5572,0.3851,0.0426,1.0434,3.831,3.0577,1.5811,5.3312,1.5053,0.4537,1.429,0.0103,3.5159,0.3788,0.2282,0.0002,5.5871,0.7957,4.4902,2.5865,4.8971,0.8056,3.5365,0.7448,0.0446,0.6452,1.4986,0.0579,0.1936,4.0231,5.5114,0.6725,1.0218,0.099,4.6343,0.4228,0.0588,0.0,0.9401,4.4723,0.0118,0.0035,4.0139,0.5044,0.0092,0.4184,4.1946,3.9514,0.4658,1.1945,0.4973,5.1234,1.8385,3.7903,1.2878,1.6231,5.3486,0.0324,4.8988,4.0976,3.8106,3.5498,2.5254,1.8526,1.6803,0.3977,0.1535,0.0002,2.8242,4.0722,6.8724,5.7942,4.8666,0.0028,0.4839,2.2932,3.5781,3.9272,4.1319,0.8649,4.305,0.1316,5.0796,0.0727,5.537,2.8051,2.3191,2.0294,0.0359,2.7377,2.5449,2.067,0.6043,1.9045,2.3024,2.6346,0.9797,2.6056,5.087,0.5044,4.1577,1.935,1.1474,0.7386,0.7834,0.1715,0.0002,4.797,1.6617,1.6702,0.9287,1.8481,4.7739,4.719,0.0294,6.2565,1.2,4.0493,5.5158,4.7092,3.6776,1.9517,1.801,0.4159,5.7123,0.1306,0.3041,2.7976,0.7754,0.0064,4.2962,3.7479,2.3006,5.5267,0.0005,0.0012,0.0023,4.8511,0.2646,0.344,1.4125,4.1624,5.8634,2.5071,3.598,1.8778,3.4886,3.5879,2.0318,2.0589,1.0718,2.3389,3.2211,0.4495,4.2002,2.4628,4.8713,1.5912,0.0682,5.3608,4.0955,3.3074,0.931,0.0048,2.2479,3.0257,3.3574,0.1694,1.2337,0.7519,0.1431,0.0002,4.8802,0.0011,1.783,5.4561,2.0342,3.8984,3.8105,0.1086,5.3821,3.7545,0.0272,1.4529,2.4038,1.3459,2.8462,4.4214,0.1539,0.659,1.5695,4.1717,0.9827,0.8665,3.3363,0.001,1.4544,2.696,1.6439,0.988,3.6625,4.2842,3.8771,0.4965,5.1105,0.5955,0.1412,0.0013,1.0573,0.5378,0.0002,4.496,0.0036,1.7214,5.9387,0.0522,0.0015,7.0692,0.6401,4.536,2.943,2.8146,0.3821,1.7548,3.4295,4.6619,1.0188,3.5059,1.0537,1.3779,0.0026,3.2565,2.3681,1.451,0.4265,1.5373,5.1665,0.0206,0.5736,5.0273,1.6441,5.0484,0.0003,0.8581,2.2785,3.6364,5.7114,5.3871,3.5724,0.2888,2.2131,2.1491,0.536,0.0004,0.0607,0.0012,0.0011,5.9326,3.2095,0.5716,1.3362,0.2919,1.2377,3.5471,0.0292,0.6368,0.0371,2.139,2.9319,1.883,3.5458,0.6915,4.4124,1.1101,5.1263,0.0162,5.5207,4.0508,0.3206,4.1422,0.6973,0.1979,0.0002,2.7946,0.0028,2.3392,2.3526,0.8586,0.6523,1.9409,1.2844,3.9671,5.1057,3.7496,5.4875,3.9632,1.436,6.3434,1.1579,3.0478,0.3335,4.6551,1.4568,3.4671,3.7322,0.6799,2.8845,2.1862,4.3947,1.8498,1.026,1.0695,4.3632,4.5835,1.7172,3.3651,3.0822,3.4559,0.5285,1.0684,1.9905,3.2315,0.0013,2.2522,2.2889,1.7574,1.2874,2.588,1.5415,5.602,2.8308,3.3529,0.0391,2.4081,1.2569,2.1087,1.1795,1.9403,2.7234,1.4599,0.8647,0.1497,0.0002,5.6067,6.1226,1.089,1.6281,2.2362,3.3733,2.306,0.1089,4.0604,2.7823,1.9658,0.0714,0.0032,0.1494,2.1008,2.4101,1.5577,0.5014,4.7597,3.2835,0.3399,0.8381,0.8151,0.2973,2.2816,5.8774,0.6859,5.4207,2.7273,2.1229,5.6919,1.2523,4.0738,0.8127,1.9207,1.7037,2.5298,2.9348,4.2725,1.4007,3.38,1.7301,4.2227,3.6165,1.8437,0.3659,0.0137,0.9585,3.3544,0.257,0.0303,4.0292,3.565,4.4667,4.0259,1.3268,0.9418,0.1333,5.7986,0.3499,1.7182,0.2979,4.2368,3.7461,2.4811,2.1155,0.3683,0.7024,0.1706,0.4716,0.1865,0.0105,7.3225,2.1053,0.3876,0.6144,0.6381,0.2312,0.0003,2.8625,0.0031,3.5613,2.4795,4.0098,0.8738,2.5832,1.0247,0.4295,2.3302,1.3178,4.8694,3.3269,2.2347,0.7312,3.0105,4.6402,4.4794,3.4051,4.3699,2.8628,1.8748,0.7968,1.7902,0.395,2.8388,1.0591,5.2614,1.9209,0.947,0.1786,0.0023,3.4917,1.0187,3.6782,1.988,2.8717,5.9324,4.8167,2.7518,1.8678,4.7776,4.7789,0.1138,2.8727,4.5596,0.6988,1.4304,5.026,4.513,2.6776,4.0876,6.2598,4.8658,1.5263,0.5,0.5118,0.5356,0.2629,0.0002,2.1615,0.8799,0.0783,0.0033,2.0715,4.4608,
