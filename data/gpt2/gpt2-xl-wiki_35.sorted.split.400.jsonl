{"id":3146,"ended":true,"length":375,"gen_text":"Hata's major contribution to Nanking Massacre studies is his book Nankin jiken ( `` The Nanking Incident `` ), published in 1986, which is a detailed study of the event based on eyewitnesses and survivor testimony. \u00a0Hata's primary purpose was to provide historical context for the Nanking Massacre and to explore the implications of those events for modern-day Japanese society. As a result of the research done on Nanking, Japan has become relatively better known and its wartime past and subsequent peace are better understood. The Nanking Massacre and Peace in Japan is a small book and it contains only a handful of new facts or information. The author has attempted to use the historical research done on the event to determine what would have happened had it not happened. By doing so, he believes, he can help readers to understand Japan's post-World War II history and can help lay the groundwork for improving living conditions for future generations. Hata's book is also unique in that it is the first full-length book on the Nanking Massacre in a western language. Other works such as the book `` The Rape of Nanking: The Rape of History ` s Story ``, by William Blum, cover part of the same ground, however, they are written in American English, have less historical information, and use more political arguments to give the impression of being more authoritative. One problem with the works of these authors is that they do not provide historical accounts that are based on eyewitness report and survivor testimony. Their accounts are more historical accounts that are based on newspaper accounts. They also provide the impression that American forces were the perpetrators of the massacre, when in fact it was local Japanese soldiers that were involved. Nanking Massacre and Peace in Japan is a smaller book that is meant to be used as a supplemental reference for students of Japanese history at U.C. Berkeley and in the San Francisco Bay Area.

It will be built, she says, so as not to generate plasma, but rather magnetic fields.\n\n\"This way, we can make a big difference in how we understand and study the origin of the Universe,\" said Voss. \"Because if you look for magnetic fields, you can only find them where you've made lots of particles. When you do this, the results can be radically different \u2013 different predictions, different processes, things like that.\"\n\nVoss believes that magnetic fields produced by giant magnets on the LHC should allow for a better understanding of the origin of mass.

In this model, there is a high proportion of the body adipose tissue, so some of the key characteristics of obesity in humans may be seen. In this paper we provide a description of the mouse as a model for the study of human obesity, with particular focus on the use of the adipose tissue as the substrate to understand the obesity-related processes, which will then be extended to the human. Specific attention is given to several basic features that identify the mouse as an appropriate model for studying the processes involved in obesity and its treatment. The data presented here provide a good foundation as well as additional important details that can guide future work. By applying recent experimental and genetic approaches, we will provide detailed information that will allow the researchers to generate novel therapeutically relevant models for human obesity, as well as providing opportunities for basic research. Finally, we will review the current evidence for the functional importance of the adipose tissue and the potential role of its loss in obesity-related diseases.","token_len":400,"entropy":[9.2196,4.4906,3.7471,4.7297,11.5574,2.2036,13.03,0.4429,0.1333,1.6457,2.9834,3.4666,2.1384,6.5965,0.0073,1.194,0.6282,8.4295,0.5166,2.8929,0.0711,3.3839,0.7068,2.2269,9.7661,0.2472,0.0134,0.0203,4.0322,3.2191,4.2462,3.3867,0.7318,0.7066,8.5479,2.4415,5.4599,3.586,2.3508,0.1812,3.2547,1.9683,4.9655,0.8673,1.0898,7.2617,0.7708,2.3257,3.7232,3.6475,2.323,6.5743,1.0577,1.6444,2.4738,0.4126,1.2856,5.6414,2.7677,1.0248,2.4129,5.9525,0.2186,0.1644,3.9681,0.9647,6.0818,3.18,3.295,0.9805,6.4802,7.7363,0.065,0.0021,1.7481,0.4886,1.5557,2.0173,1.3926,0.0349,0.0749,2.6432,2.2634,3.5302,3.2475,1.7826,3.5696,0.0008,2.6067,2.3239,1.7536,2.7904,0.05,0.0061,0.0262,2.5783,0.0427,6.291,0.5228,4.042,0.0255,0.2268,4.6055,2.7368,3.2705,1.3572,0.5095,0.0124,0.0001,4.4598,0.6033,2.9013,0.037,0.3589,0.0363,1.4144,2.2751,1.701,2.2179,2.3451,0.0156,0.002,0.0052,1.2801,1.1526,2.3918,3.0966,5.4334,0.151,1.1871,2.5301,0.0353,2.0167,0.6124,1.4302,3.3492,1.2014,2.4342,2.7795,4.4543,4.6033,0.1435,1.6479,0.4331,1.4581,1.073,0.0059,0.0028,0.0045,0.2387,0.2185,3.8751,4.9253,5.7139,1.2163,0.0355,3.4346,0.7034,0.4574,5.1855,4.1608,2.6177,0.641,2.4942,1.802,0.0884,0.7566,0.1409,6.0297,0.152,0.3025,1.1724,0.0476,1.3589,0.2083,1.1207,0.0048,0.5565,3.1394,3.1947,6.2646,3.9614,4.6474,3.3245,1.2668,1.6706,0.0002,4.942,5.0893,1.6176,0.5003,4.9101,0.007,2.4659,3.7267,1.746,0.256,0.1144,1.2104,2.2044,0.2907,0.8597,2.6479,1.1277,1.4451,0.0782,3.8249,0.6455,0.8419,2.9083,4.4972,0.0301,3.8327,1.7547,4.5393,0.0664,0.0854,3.2715,4.8183,6.3038,0.9713,0.2474,5.8718,2.6454,0.3366,1.9129,1.9063,0.0698,3.1136,0.2952,3.1556,1.0101,2.5428,1.8622,2.3706,2.2229,3.3801,0.9632,1.93,0.0387,0.3777,1.9375,3.0105,0.2475,0.2116,0.3867,2.1857,1.8654,0.0138,1.3432,0.0841,1.7635,2.7364,2.3028,1.9612,0.0097,0.6085,5.3529,0.0159,0.7419,3.6318,0.7432,0.1151,0.6728,3.5299,4.9982,3.8628,4.2944,0.6126,5.0406,1.3545,0.4578,3.186,3.4524,3.9315,3.6966,3.6898,0.6979,4.085,0.0866,1.3955,1.3582,0.5943,6.2705,2.861,0.593,0.5651,0.0206,5.2852,5.3081,2.883,2.6779,6.2336,0.3997,0.4322,0.2092,2.0104,1.3036,0.151,0.505,2.1789,1.7737,4.2794,2.377,0.0487,1.0074,2.2312,2.3374,2.5114,0.221,2.6554,4.9194,1.0762,1.1345,3.1255,0.8837,4.3839,2.0975,7.1225,1.6095,0.0152,4.6744,4.8825,3.1974,1.7725,2.0871,4.5939,1.016,2.2252,0.8749,6.6323,4.0794,6.1034,5.8565,2.3389,3.5504,1.7829,0.6156,0.7212,1.7413,3.0382,4.9235,1.3371,2.3244,0.5242,1.855,1.5329,5.2397,0.186,5.1172,2.4621,3.3496,4.4878,0.0009,0.861,2.6834,1.1746,2.1291,0.0703,3.099,2.749,0.1628,0.006,4.7732,4.7666,0.4545,4.0637,1.1653,1.0768,4.5414,0.0175,1.082,0.7485,2.7141,0.7866,2.131,4.6744,1.3055,0.3995,5.6666,2.5073,0.0304,0.6042,0.9768,0.105,0.0433,1.6612,1.5855,2.571,2.7222,0.3059,3.9919,3.6424,0.514,1.1643,1.9976,0.0959,0.95,0.2086]}
{"id":2920,"ended":true,"length":350,"gen_text":"The vast majority of living organisms encode their genes in long strands of DNA ( deoxyribonucleic acid ). DNA consists of a chain made from four types of nucleotide subunits, each composed of three nucleotide subunits in a specific sequence of 3, 4, or 5 nucleotides.\n\nGenes have been found in almost every known living organism. The first gene was identified as early as 1930 but other genes have been discovered after that. About 60 of the genes are expressed and function in the body.\n\nA gene is a segment of DNA that encodes a protein-coding gene in the eukaryote cell. The genes encoded inside of the germ cells can initiate the processes that determine a cell's sex and cause it to grow.\n\nThe majority of human genes come from our mother or our father. The genes found in our cells can change in the direction they come from, which tells us whether an organism can have any children.\n\nGenes and the development of the human body are controlled by an intricate network of interactions between DNA, RNA, and protein.\n\nAt birth, a female embryo develops into a foetus. Later in embryogenesis, there are four main stages of embryogenesis: implantation, growth, development, and maturation. Most humans develop into adult size at age 10.\n\nThe male and female reproductive systems work together to produce genetic information in cells. In vitro fertilization procedures allow sperm and egg cells to enter each other.\n\nAn embryo's genes are stored in a nucleus located inside a cell that then divides to form two identical gametes. The chromosomes in one cell will only fuse if they come into contact with those in another cell. The chromosomes then break up the cells into smaller cells called cell segments, called gametes.\n\nHuman life begins when the gametes split to become sperm and egg cells. Male and female gametes combine to form a blastocyst.","token_len":401,"entropy":[7.7841,0.1275,0.0871,8.4869,2.3234,8.1011,2.2228,1.7702,0.5429,5.123,3.668,0.1368,0.4916,3.0284,11.1585,1.0661,0.0093,0.031,0.0052,0.0037,0.0942,2.3803,2.9876,3.7001,0.0147,1.8893,2.9855,6.1073,4.7193,0.9657,5.4383,0.0088,1.1069,2.0307,5.7275,0.0474,1.6208,2.7342,3.4685,0.0095,2.2208,1.3926,1.2055,1.1943,0.0044,4.8092,0.8358,2.566,1.7137,2.7559,2.9158,2.2916,0.8685,0.0788,0.7303,0.0304,0.9304,0.0592,0.0002,0.5191,2.2542,0.0079,3.4285,0.8747,4.0659,1.7563,2.1013,0.5924,3.364,0.5063,3.345,1.021,0.6155,1.268,2.1302,3.6595,3.6464,0.6281,2.0008,3.825,2.1907,0.0028,4.8218,4.9225,6.583,1.2599,1.4345,0.834,0.8701,4.9605,1.0002,1.1595,4.8375,3.6646,3.8989,0.4102,3.0215,2.266,2.4672,2.6528,4.437,0.6841,1.2307,1.3878,0.9769,1.5747,0.0002,3.2985,0.9263,0.5018,0.9748,2.4802,0.0112,0.0841,0.5281,1.6746,0.0,0.3401,0.3757,5.1975,0.5446,0.0001,0.5748,3.3736,1.4136,4.9709,0.0279,0.0004,2.2369,1.265,0.3189,1.4761,3.0136,5.6262,6.811,2.4005,1.0658,6.9312,0.8156,4.8834,6.2667,1.2008,4.5816,1.2818,3.6778,2.5531,2.2742,0.044,1.6294,1.4252,5.215,0.9122,0.0096,2.1675,2.2157,1.1173,0.0002,1.7957,4.6111,0.0085,2.8563,0.2847,4.257,0.0691,1.9792,1.7732,2.9709,2.3132,0.2386,0.509,1.9857,1.7602,3.7804,0.2197,1.6282,1.9804,3.6387,3.6573,3.1641,2.53,5.6216,3.0483,4.6731,0.0368,1.8592,2.5708,6.0269,0.4126,3.3263,3.69,1.51,3.905,3.3732,3.7911,2.1741,0.6297,0.7593,0.0002,2.2009,0.3881,3.4507,2.6032,3.8412,0.0469,0.9576,0.9827,0.9189,3.009,2.24,0.1196,4.1562,0.4922,1.2315,0.0179,3.8065,0.5028,2.7976,1.2753,1.8231,0.2964,0.6266,2.1583,0.9878,1.3334,0.0002,5.8622,1.3465,0.1251,2.0612,6.7123,1.8924,2.4199,1.1122,0.1852,4.1908,0.009,1.179,6.0835,1.1055,5.1759,0.2612,0.0998,5.6964,0.5711,3.2358,2.591,0.6415,1.1817,3.2689,0.0624,0.7328,4.5841,0.0013,0.1873,3.1879,0.1696,2.3439,0.2828,0.0069,0.6191,0.0006,0.0831,5.7253,4.6758,2.078,2.6314,4.1319,2.5606,1.9202,3.3331,3.9867,1.1833,0.523,0.0002,1.5971,5.2606,1.8268,0.0136,1.0837,0.3759,3.0137,1.1765,0.4669,1.3711,5.9466,1.066,2.357,4.0304,1.1752,3.0989,6.3148,0.0111,0.116,5.5581,2.7519,2.1732,0.5182,0.6685,0.4488,0.0539,5.2712,1.8201,0.0089,2.5084,1.3487,0.0002,4.4768,0.7445,3.7322,3.6359,0.4513,2.9549,0.3076,1.6787,2.6526,3.4559,2.8365,2.6855,0.396,4.8493,5.406,1.6075,1.2,1.01,1.5325,3.4161,4.1907,0.0035,0.0004,0.7686,1.5119,3.1487,2.1173,4.0898,4.2312,4.597,4.8502,5.8666,2.9048,1.6283,1.5425,3.043,0.0717,0.1508,2.0691,0.6315,1.3967,0.2922,0.2706,2.5692,2.2928,5.0043,5.1324,2.236,4.5207,3.067,1.0887,2.1826,1.059,1.4775,4.7973,5.6438,1.8955,3.1555,1.7686,0.0026,0.0047,0.2588,0.5046,0.0002,3.5267,3.8578,0.3012,2.0192,1.5324,2.4331,0.1798,0.0022,4.104,3.2122,2.5673,3.0069,0.1639,0.4385,0.0702,0.2552,5.8506,0.3878,0.0027,0.5871,0.0227,0.0005,4.3003,0.4828,0.4174,0.569,3.5821,0.0563,0.0008,1.0637]}
{"id":535,"ended":true,"length":396,"gen_text":"Season 5 includes seven episodes, eight if you include the `` Tell All `` at the end, and eleven if you include the `` Sitting Down with the Browns ``, `` Meri Jaan ``, `` My Sister's Keeper `` and `` My Dad's Not Here`` -- so if you make it to 13 episodes, you'll make it through the series in roughly two days. With the exception of `` My Daughter's Boyfriend'' and `` Who Is Gonna Take My Hand? `` (these two are in the middle of what might be considered the middle of the show), all the episodes in Season 5 are better than the ones you've probably seen in your lifetime. Season 6 begins with the two stories '' My Brother's Keeper `` and `` My Boss's Daughter --- neither of which are terrible or weak stories by themselves. As a group, the stories in Season 6 are both weaker and more successful than the stories in Season 5. There are five complete stories, and two incomplete stories. One of these, `` Shrieking at Me and A Very Special Episode,`` is a story that you won't find in the Season 5 box set. The other is `` The Best Job in Hell ``, which I hope to one day get the American Box Set that will replace this one. All of the other stories, even the complete ones, are better than the two stories in Season 5. Not bad, right? So what if you haven't seen the two complete stories? This is the boxset I got the other day. The two incomplete stories, though, are as good as the others -- that's just the way it is for me. That's my problem with cable. If you don't get season premieres and incomplete stories, it means that you're missing out on some of the best television I've ever seen. The television gods have not blessed me with complete seasons, and that's sad. So go enjoy Season 6 -- you will be missing out if you don't.","token_len":401,"entropy":[2.9834,9.695,5.4641,0.7844,1.4886,5.4162,1.2468,0.0803,1.253,0.5291,13.4359,14.168,2.5283,3.3605,7.6829,0.0453,0.1138,3.1476,1.0726,6.0889,0.3822,0.0458,0.7198,0.309,1.758,10.1208,2.8484,3.2059,2.3551,9.8743,1.7901,5.3265,3.4396,9.5911,3.6957,3.6129,0.486,0.8604,0.3807,0.4792,4.3526,4.1535,1.0381,0.6207,0.3141,1.1494,0.3935,3.4578,4.4811,0.7919,3.8829,1.5947,3.989,6.2874,4.5525,3.4895,0.3288,6.0335,1.4181,1.1747,4.7804,1.2869,0.4529,0.43,1.951,4.4284,0.2017,2.3109,1.1556,1.9927,3.8395,4.5167,2.3772,3.2939,0.2353,5.8061,1.7181,1.4253,0.0051,1.0778,1.9107,4.4144,0.4843,2.1882,0.0254,4.1014,0.7031,0.4059,5.9897,2.9212,4.287,1.0017,1.3591,2.6884,4.0615,0.7102,0.4184,1.094,6.1081,1.2409,1.5006,3.7463,0.6247,2.8517,0.1894,5.1466,3.8905,0.1892,1.4139,0.4505,2.7138,0.4862,0.234,2.7723,0.6837,1.8548,1.057,0.7072,2.6193,1.4906,0.0767,0.5212,5.0526,0.1035,0.5474,1.4268,4.1232,1.0896,3.0432,0.3448,1.9919,3.2366,1.1702,0.2955,4.1731,2.1383,3.0675,0.7141,1.1945,4.3368,5.6566,5.1113,3.2533,2.4374,0.4599,0.1498,1.454,0.078,0.3798,1.0816,6.2153,0.3123,0.4233,6.7668,5.6125,0.2075,0.105,1.4094,4.7618,4.4053,5.5559,3.1348,3.3967,2.9832,1.4483,4.7279,2.3619,3.5705,0.1228,1.3905,1.5416,0.7949,0.3395,0.0443,0.2301,5.1312,5.0556,0.2607,2.283,4.4184,0.1124,0.6665,1.4286,0.4636,0.1755,0.0277,0.4407,3.9426,0.6547,4.2226,6.1488,1.6007,1.8862,1.7136,2.2732,2.8883,0.6187,0.8993,3.8598,0.4397,2.4084,3.0647,0.2733,6.968,3.5664,1.0055,2.9717,3.1018,4.0497,5.445,4.1501,0.9735,1.564,1.7362,4.7135,0.4698,1.642,3.1008,0.9196,3.7059,3.7606,0.003,1.8228,0.71,1.8203,3.5944,0.3558,1.5884,0.2235,0.7108,1.4561,0.4164,2.4954,0.6765,1.7446,4.8783,4.4378,0.2485,6.574,2.4164,0.707,0.5376,2.9568,4.8026,1.5511,4.19,0.0045,2.3381,2.8208,6.6945,5.0144,0.2897,4.8719,3.2547,6.3697,2.0926,0.6369,0.409,4.116,1.4167,0.3125,3.5581,0.6692,2.7088,4.0482,0.5939,2.7326,0.2589,0.1208,0.2002,1.9075,0.0931,0.7071,6.5512,1.8742,0.9781,0.2189,0.0248,0.4375,5.4986,2.6628,1.8434,2.3657,0.0102,4.0826,1.863,3.3005,1.6938,2.5543,0.0012,0.3358,1.4625,4.4149,1.714,0.104,1.3391,4.4844,0.6022,1.6594,4.2722,3.7765,4.0685,5.7572,4.6156,3.6599,0.4846,0.8637,2.529,3.4182,0.8476,0.0327,2.2078,4.6146,0.7502,0.3237,5.1017,0.4296,0.127,1.0088,5.4299,4.0637,4.9862,0.7295,4.0428,1.213,0.4823,0.9178,0.2797,4.5336,0.8757,0.2108,4.6829,0.4875,3.4794,3.6285,0.6335,5.4673,2.0191,2.8155,0.6551,2.0193,0.0006,2.3775,5.9655,4.6483,0.0,2.1723,3.4674,0.5119,0.3031,2.7479,3.3438,1.166,1.0547,1.4722,1.4026,0.3153,0.3426,1.6474,1.237,0.0771,0.2925,1.0319,3.124,0.2709,0.3513,0.0623,0.1625,2.9314,5.4185,6.191,1.8144,3.1415,2.1815,0.8182,0.2869,2.8865,0.8426,2.2504,1.7703,3.1536,0.4414,4.2407,0.3846,3.3885,4.6003,6.3594,1.1318,0.685,3.9597,2.5455,3.8228,1.8895,2.515,0.1442,1.8131,0.0059,0.2218,0.0004,0.2076]}

He was the son of the Marquess of Charming, and the son-in-law of the Empress of Mars, but he was the son-in-law of the President of the Free Worlds League who was also the son-in-law of the Empress of Mars. Newall attended Mount St. Helens School in Shropshire before he was sent off to the School of Advanced Studies in the planet Earth, which was known as the Imperial Academy. He was assigned to the Space Station, the station was run by the Imperial High Command, and there he was known as the `First Lord of the Astronaut Corps.` Newall also served as the First Lord of the Astronaut Corps and the Chief Astronomer. Newall's tenure as Chief Astronomer lasted longer than his tenure as First Lord of the Astronaut Corps, where they served one year each in each of 5 different posts (the Astronomer being the only one to retain the title while holding two offices). On the 6th of January 1939, the First Lord visited the planet Hoth in the year 34 AB, following that incident as well, he went on a tour of duty with the Emperor's Astronauts, and he died in the Battle of Endor in 4 AB, following a battle by the crew of the Eta-2 Intrepid. Newall did at least one other visit to the planet Hoth which was unknown to his family, on March 28, 1939. He was buried in Westminster Abbey.","token_len":402,"entropy":[13.458,2.4068,1.7739,11.3205,14.0017,5.1797,9.4505,3.3158,7.5936,3.4374,0.0207,4.8474,5.3434,0.0845,0.0436,1.4483,0.575,0.0788,3.0453,4.3731,0.3862,9.7949,4.223,8.9135,15.4978,1.0399,8.017,5.0938,2.1461,5.3576,1.0003,6.909,0.7955,0.0802,4.6895,10.633,4.3582,0.3375,3.0611,2.4207,0.0178,2.1927,2.4193,0.0196,1.5135,1.2802,3.4447,0.629,2.5204,0.0467,0.002,3.4553,4.8384,1.7851,4.6154,1.4906,0.8292,2.4833,2.6904,0.2046,1.6014,1.0,2.2616,0.345,0.0026,1.9678,2.0596,1.3535,0.0023,0.9265,3.1388,1.2809,2.2214,3.5692,0.0326,0.8558,2.5333,4.838,1.5665,1.4094,6.3556,0.0604,1.8708,1.2824,5.6153,1.2369,5.5772,0.3531,1.4348,3.5901,0.5265,3.4253,4.7135,1.5586,0.006,0.0196,0.8351,1.1623,0.651,0.915,1.5981,0.0145,1.6396,4.4184,0.4262,0.3953,4.6735,5.3606,1.173,2.4313,1.1731,2.2767,0.8259,0.0016,0.0072,0.0059,0.042,0.4174,5.4497,0.5856,3.9934,1.2183,3.4731,1.9152,1.1462,2.9682,2.0919,1.4359,0.0043,0.0044,0.0115,0.0671,0.6914,4.4491,0.0965,0.3832,6.1911,1.2199,0.2957,5.1347,1.4395,2.5043,0.7245,1.3523,0.4229,0.0013,0.0026,0.0037,0.0186,0.3846,1.943,0.2847,0.5781,0.5093,3.5639,0.0107,3.6632,6.2976,1.7454,0.241,2.96,0.0052,1.5093,1.6124,5.9257,0.4699,0.0003,0.0003,3.0237,2.5105,0.8998,0.9185,2.6023,0.0976,1.0982,4.8639,0.0631,2.7352,0.8377,1.4505,1.8346,2.671,2.6836,1.414,2.4459,1.2079,4.9945,0.4072,0.8138,4.9486,0.8013,1.2585,1.5435,1.2756,5.0358,0.2836,0.3125,5.2547,4.2782,3.4641,2.7719,5.3019,1.429,4.8508,0.106,0.4406,2.5669,4.4749,0.2821,1.1609,1.063,4.5403,0.476,2.1521,3.7476,0.3181,1.2551,4.0992,4.6874,1.7905,0.711,0.2614,2.7094,1.5134,0.4588,3.9263,2.5129,2.0563,0.006,4.1342,1.5417,1.0065,1.093,2.6773,0.2817,0.7136,0.0896,1.9965,0.034,0.0389,3.4387,1.7332,2.3535,1.8846,2.2083,2.0756,2.2619,0.0033,2.2384,5.5304,0.8226,1.1369,0.011,0.0062,1.0695,5.3115,0.0379,2.0515,0.4509,0.0813,0.9941,0.0021,0.9893,0.0443,0.013,0.0025,0.0038,0.7365,6.3876,4.3397,4.3006,5.4314,1.0575,1.0955,4.1387,2.7196,2.5338,8.9104,2.3274,1.9686,4.2461,2.7366,2.2698,0.6045,3.1214,0.7164,2.3179,0.7954,1.2084,4.7043,1.9947,0.5074,5.218,4.3351,2.5401,4.5416,0.3649,3.7436,1.0794,4.1988,0.0264,0.1585,2.1938,4.3599,0.1926,1.9074,2.7279,0.0367,6.7508,0.8284,1.115,5.8121,1.0699,2.6357,0.806,3.7186,3.8728,1.9992,3.1829,6.2515,5.1045,6.3898,5.1284,1.1403,3.1753,1.1979,3.38,0.8324,2.2756,2.0673,0.1568,1.6741,2.1826,0.206,4.727,1.8786,2.5653,1.3663,1.3435,1.7135,2.5744,5.6109,1.7976,0.8887,1.9816,0.0481,1.0713,0.0009,1.5935,0.2921,0.001,2.2265,3.8647,2.8702,2.1903,6.1081,0.2389,6.188,0.0476,0.1762,4.0491,0.5516,1.0055,0.0459,3.3685,1.1816,0.0004,1.1732,2.2376,0.0066,5.4877,6.8931,0.4888,0.9783,2.6114,3.4882,0.1585,0.7872,0.1342,1.0154,0.0002,5.8876,1.206,3.6628,0.1744,1.6836,2.0151,0.9995,4.1422,6.0688,3.8823,0.7488,2.0126,2.2442,2.0556,0.9527,1.703,0.9238,4.9702,0.0885,1.597]}
{"id":180,"ended":true,"length":344,"gen_text":"Antimony is mainly used as its trioxide in making flame @ - @ proofing compounds. It is nearly always used in combination with halogenated flame retardants, with the only exception being in halogenated flame retardants that are not chlorinated phenols. (For example flame retardants containing halogenated fluoromethanes.) Its main use has been for the manufacture of synthetic polymers, as well as other highly controlled products that required fire retardants due to their toxicity. In addition, it was used to make fire suppression compounds and flame fighting materials for many decades, although that use seems to have fallen off in recent times, since it is now rarely needed. (For example, it doesn't seem to have been used much recently for flame retardant foams, with the exception of some of the older versions.)\nFoams with phenol, chlorinated phenols, benzoquinones, acrylonitrile (LDE), and other chemicals are often labeled as containing trivalent mercury. As far as I can find however, the FDA doesn't deem any of these substances to be halogenated phenols. In fact, while I was writing this article, a manufacturer wrote to say that some of the foams they produce are not fluorinated phenols. I suspect that some of them are, but not all. When I was looking for the word halogenated, I discovered that these isomers are sometimes used interchangeably. So the two words are synonymous. I found that the common name of foams (the two main ones), is that of phenol dicarbonate. While these chemicals are often used for various substances, most frequently as flame retardants, they are not commonly used in fireproof finishes. But they are generally included in many fireProof Foam products.\nMixtures of these isomers commonly used in fireproof finishes\nThis is a great infographic on flame retardants.

On May 23, 2008, Dutkiewicz died suddenly in California. Dutkiewicz was 41 years old.\n\nDutkiewicz also collaborated with members of the band AFI in several productions, producing tracks for the band's 2005 album 'One Step Beyond', and for their 2006 release 'The Sound Of A Thousand Snakes' in addition to the band's own 2011 comeback album 'The Road Goes On' and album 'A New Beginning'. His contribution to the latter has been noted for being one of the greatest guitar solos on a Rush song, since \"The Spirit of Radio\" from 2001's 'Clockwork Angels', which features on the song \"PowerCrazy\" from 2008's 'Lamb Of God'. Dutkiewicz was also the bassist for Australia's Dream Theater, where he played with bassist Scott Shriner, guitarist Alex Lifeson, and drummer John Petrucci.\n\nDutkiewicz was a founding member of the Australian psychedelic band The Psychedelic Furs in 1973. After The Psychedelic Furs split from Dutkiewicz, he joined the band The Electric Flag instead. His guitar style was also influenced by The Grateful Dead, and he had performed with them as a member.

{"id":3133,"ended":true,"length":361,"gen_text":"Most grasshoppers are polyphagous, eating vegetation from multiple plant sources, but some are omnivorous and also eat animal tissue and animal faeces. In general their preference is for grasses, including many species of plants in the family Loricariidae. But many species of grasshoppers eat other insects and arthropods as well, although those are infrequent.\n\nLife cycle\n\nSome species are egg laying but most are nymphs and pupae of adults. During summer and autumn the nymphs go away, and the adults lay eggs where they are able to. The eggs hatch in the following spring. The adults have wings but no eyes so must use visual cues to find the food. They lay their eggs on top of plants or into the soil with a sticky substance on them. If any insects or larger eggs are dropped onto a soil containing the eggs, they will hatch and the adult forms a new pair of winged adults. The new wings are attached to the previous pair. These will go on to complete their development. They are also able to fly but have weak wings.\n\nHabitat\n\nThey may live in sheltered habitats such as under and on the outside of buildings, in trees, under bark, or in the soil.\n\nPopulation dynamics\n\nThere is a steady rate of population growth, with some species doubling every 10 years (Hubermann and Lipscomb, 2001). However, their potential breeding range is severely limited by their tiny size, especially those that are solitary and forage over a wide area. They feed primarily on plant material, and can survive only on these plants, and are therefore extremely dependent on such plants. So when the food supplies become limited, populations can be severely depleted by a changing climate, for example through warming. This has already occurred with some species. One reason for such rapid population growth is that newly-breeding females have a high reproductive rate, in fact up to three young per female.","token_len":405,"entropy":[11.9443,2.3059,0.2902,1.5474,6.5104,0.712,0.0225,0.0004,0.9952,2.5644,6.0661,3.0842,4.0877,1.7463,4.5894,2.1114,1.6434,2.0821,1.6155,2.7097,0.0001,0.161,1.7966,4.2873,0.8628,3.9951,3.1966,2.646,4.3663,5.7771,0.0001,0.0092,0.3665,3.3569,2.4973,6.1069,5.7381,0.4071,0.5179,3.2192,0.9198,1.0053,4.8797,4.727,1.2438,0.484,5.0634,2.8406,0.3195,1.7075,4.1975,5.1283,0.1359,2.4167,0.8089,5.5751,3.9963,1.1343,1.8388,0.3818,0.0155,0.1475,3.7193,2.1793,2.4214,1.4913,2.7455,0.4579,0.0091,1.867,0.0065,1.1829,4.3123,5.7162,2.1515,6.4395,0.2751,0.6429,1.1743,0.0058,4.9783,0.44,0.3941,0.0002,4.6413,1.4562,2.3058,2.8577,2.3263,4.1547,0.6556,1.1415,3.0895,0.0551,0.3412,2.0794,3.8487,0.0168,4.1524,1.5361,0.3915,5.1912,4.0567,1.8969,0.236,1.6993,1.2307,0.001,0.2142,5.0933,6.5406,2.783,1.9206,0.7897,0.2964,3.7182,0.7487,5.7531,0.5213,2.0948,3.4005,0.0818,2.9105,1.662,0.9316,0.7421,0.9473,1.5072,1.5748,0.3738,1.3675,1.6302,2.1783,3.9741,3.5022,2.0589,2.7499,2.9117,3.2832,5.0237,2.5248,4.7605,0.5677,0.4904,0.5911,3.5911,1.5025,0.9373,2.1458,5.2505,0.8717,0.0673,1.4102,4.2962,0.0218,3.4031,2.1471,5.3889,2.3121,0.3414,5.596,2.5363,3.2621,0.7871,2.1756,1.3236,0.4897,4.2881,5.7675,2.3897,1.7014,6.5053,6.2835,0.3963,5.1916,2.1579,3.3368,5.3872,3.6962,0.6864,2.1489,0.619,1.7686,1.2648,0.6986,1.5771,1.2046,2.5826,5.26,1.3338,2.4325,4.525,0.2727,4.3575,0.5585,1.0551,0.5222,1.8886,2.6336,4.8532,1.4963,3.5015,0.4469,0.2892,3.7871,0.5249,1.6711,3.6607,4.6015,3.5274,1.3447,0.1925,3.2393,1.7565,3.0215,1.736,4.4421,2.3181,4.1625,1.0537,0.003,0.8993,3.3014,3.304,6.1276,1.5473,1.2207,0.886,0.0002,3.1943,0.0381,0.033,0.3475,0.0002,3.1964,4.8477,1.883,0.5097,4.8567,4.1167,1.2175,0.0025,1.9715,6.2449,2.7801,1.4285,4.896,0.042,1.4603,0.8507,1.3828,3.5876,0.6493,2.0744,3.0064,0.6184,1.6392,0.8262,1.7823,0.9807,0.3037,2.0262,0.0002,5.3298,3.3161,0.0787,0.0002,2.9209,0.9691,1.663,3.7296,3.8058,0.0596,1.5377,0.4158,1.8684,1.7579,2.7,0.5447,2.4101,1.4023,1.8074,0.6826,4.684,3.7061,4.8178,5.6193,1.6785,4.5965,3.5404,2.1039,1.2636,3.5898,0.1697,3.1264,0.2461,4.3063,5.7698,5.8693,1.7026,0.4232,5.5976,0.7591,0.9395,1.7198,4.9362,0.2057,1.6055,4.735,4.4294,1.207,1.2081,4.6119,2.0289,4.0449,0.5833,5.133,1.2793,0.974,0.4872,0.3069,2.6359,5.3786,3.2979,0.0672,3.0768,0.9764,1.1741,1.9492,3.5218,2.7399,1.7243,0.8342,4.8798,2.1882,2.629,1.9428,3.1517,1.8887,4.5901,3.6163,0.087,4.9022,1.4209,1.0732,4.5482,4.7605,2.1718,1.747,2.9713,2.8397,2.4991,0.4715,1.3046,1.7352,3.2092,2.4904,3.0536,4.4111,2.4814,5.9428,0.7438,1.6454,3.4386,0.0783,4.0037,4.2252,1.6651,3.0828,2.6711,2.7423,1.4264,2.841,1.6155,0.7197,2.0069,5.8647,3.37,0.4657,3.3307,2.9259,0.4151,0.4794,0.4397,0.7817,6.0134,1.5742,5.1923,2.0499,2.8188,1.615,2.0813,2.5741,0.3675,1.141,4.9546,3.8777,3.0133,0.0027,2.9231,7.158,0.8752,0.7627,1.4694]}

The cast stayed together for years, with the exception of Joey Tribbiani (who joined the show in the second season; Kudrow would soon leave for a series regular role with Married\u2014 the pilot's first spinoff), and remained relatively stable.\n\nWith more shows being cancelled in the past five years, like It's Garry Shandling's Show and The Office, some have blamed the writers' room as the reason, and there's truth to that. A few showrunners have complained about some of the series' early work\u2014as in, the producers were so desperate for work that they cut out entire scenes in a way that was painful to watch.\n\nBut when NBC canceled Friends in 1998, it was the beginning of one of the most stable years in television history (the show still has a strong following, especially online), and one of the most famous friendships in pop culture: Friends is the longest-running sitcom of all time (the two main characters were even involved in a high school romance after the series finale), and arguably the funniest.\n\nIn addition to the five seasons that made it to the series finale, David Crane left the writing staff in 2004, and in 2007, the writing staff was replaced at NBC by a new generation of young showrunners.\n\nWhat do you think of this tweet, @THR?\n\n[Featured Image by Ethan Miller\/Getty Images]","token_len":406,"entropy":[5.7635,6.8105,11.5059,9.522,5.9697,9.9752,8.3215,3.3012,10.7736,6.4965,3.2925,3.6215,0.9786,9.4822,4.9604,5.0489,3.8402,0.4605,6.8743,0.5621,0.0815,0.0404,0.0495,6.6823,8.6972,1.4156,5.3801,8.3619,2.5754,0.0867,0.772,2.8988,6.7637,0.0795,0.0005,3.8134,0.3903,3.1634,3.918,0.5446,3.2957,3.575,0.8997,0.0055,0.0125,0.0054,0.0005,0.0022,2.5398,3.5481,0.0007,1.5539,0.0751,0.0013,4.2024,4.5062,3.3929,1.8641,3.9176,0.6355,1.3477,5.6321,1.1312,0.9709,0.947,1.923,4.5723,0.0093,3.5273,2.1388,2.2034,2.0984,3.1194,2.6119,3.7014,0.6753,6.1785,0.0088,4.6852,2.0668,1.8882,2.2088,0.9799,4.4604,1.0741,2.8503,1.7773,1.4682,0.0002,3.1494,2.3184,0.1586,2.7384,0.1097,0.5831,0.0371,0.0006,0.0102,0.0042,0.003,0.1545,0.8058,1.1582,1.4901,1.3076,3.6053,4.1266,9.1905,0.3776,2.6325,0.0589,0.0004,1.7353,2.749,0.0012,0.0001,0.0002,0.4678,2.1044,2.9494,6.4157,0.2853,0.6377,3.0882,0.8643,2.6127,1.9295,1.2959,0.0073,4.0381,0.3075,0.0024,0.0002,2.5149,1.6701,3.7891,0.8321,0.8029,0.841,1.6585,2.0319,0.0663,6.1058,4.3909,0.0167,0.0005,4.0298,4.7079,0.3715,2.0338,1.8856,3.011,3.3689,0.25,4.0448,5.6209,7.5811,5.6056,4.968,2.7962,2.7458,2.1856,0.1625,3.0991,0.7817,4.727,5.05,1.968,2.9929,0.5775,0.0002,5.0997,6.2094,4.7557,2.9848,1.6115,2.9198,0.9653,2.5581,4.2998,0.1068,0.7684,5.3112,5.88,0.017,3.0597,0.0036,0.0001,0.0005,0.1419,0.0233,1.114,1.9684,3.0469,0.2121,4.7367,1.9691,4.1871,0.6868,2.4986,0.8452,0.2757,1.5826,0.6935,0.6226,3.5406,2.2863,3.5151,0.9724,1.8141,0.1991,0.1591,0.3803,4.8578,3.6319,4.4415,0.3808,1.0457,5.0382,0.6757,6.1809,0.538,0.2627,4.4967,0.6673,4.8258,4.468,3.2201,4.7731,2.5197,0.8057,1.779,6.0317,2.4169,3.828,4.0712,1.4051,3.8519,0.4993,0.0858,4.154,2.0449,3.1966,1.0314,2.9263,3.6829,3.9426,0.1273,2.2145,5.3748,0.2927,0.1525,0.6665,0.7579,0.0003,0.7966,3.8857,3.7892,2.3014,0.7096,0.9503,3.4191,0.1442,1.1371,0.9688,2.4542,4.0679,0.0041,5.2562,0.0148,0.2497,0.7622,4.0101,3.858,0.6933,0.882,0.4249,4.8936,2.6941,1.3987,4.0517,1.4192,1.4639,2.5545,1.2471,2.4678,2.9149,2.9672,1.6669,0.3882,3.5471,0.5364,0.1036,1.0538,4.7738,5.653,0.6103,3.1136,0.0538,6.0974,3.1451,3.1448,2.0717,2.1038,0.248,0.0326,1.1711,2.784,0.018,0.0579,3.336,2.8347,5.1498,3.7445,0.3326,3.0007,3.7699,5.8333,0.079,0.4915,3.7295,0.4155,1.552,5.2398,0.5697,1.9904,2.1319,1.4273,0.2471,5.8513,0.68,3.5069,0.002,1.1249,0.4422,0.0003,3.3568,2.2958,0.0608,1.2841,5.1567,1.0231,1.5829,3.0306,1.9513,0.7943,1.7129,1.9797,0.0833,0.1926,5.3023,0.1912,4.9928,0.4654,4.1743,0.2727,1.3188,3.0406,0.9827,0.8888,4.3415,2.2769,0.6075,2.1554,5.2434,0.4092,1.3185,2.1694,6.3829,0.7941,0.3281,2.9151,1.1299,3.9321,0.2455,5.4293,3.3921,0.0187,1.1514,1.2204,0.0002,4.4965,2.6363,0.017,0.0947,1.5623,2.3257,3.9455,2.9187,2.9513,4.0053,0.002,0.0809,2.0876,0.0002,1.805,0.9205,0.1252,0.0543,5.3584,0.0003,0.0216,0.0011,0.0046,0.0599]}

{"id":689,"ended":true,"length":378,"gen_text":"The most noted prerogative power that affects the judicial system is the prerogative of mercy, which has two elements : the granting of pardons and the granting of nolle prosequi. Pardons may eliminate punishment or mitigate punishment, in extreme circumstances, by replacing it with something other than a punishment. Thus, under English law, a defendant could be released on parole for three to five years, after which he could be sent to prison for another two to three years. This provision was not so popular and thus was restricted to cases involving the death penalty.\n\nA defendant can exercise a prerogative power only if the law already compels him to exercise it. On the other hand, the courts are not constrained to determine guilt beyond reasonable doubt for any given crime.\n\nBy law, the punishment of a criminal may be revoked by the law. As a general rule, however, a government cannot revoke the death penalty or any other punishment without a formal act of Parliament.\n\nThe prerogative of mercy often limits the scope of the crime in a punishment and the extent to which a sentence may be commuted for mercy. A judge can determine that the defendant is suffering from a mental illness or disorder that would render him susceptible to a cruel and unusual punishment, but cannot order that he die. He might refuse a clemency plea even if the defendant meets the clemency criteria because he has no way of ascertaining whether the defendant will be capable of making a sound decision once released from imprisonment.\n\nEven when granted the power of mercy by the law, a judge can impose as many punishments as he deems just. He can grant parole to a person only if he considers that doing so is morally desirable, if necessary to punish further crimes, or if it is necessary for public safety, as in the case of a homicide at the scene. He may impose a very long jail term in case of a serious crime if the sentence may serve as a deterrent to future offenses.","token_len":406,"entropy":[4.9999,8.1256,7.7767,4.616,0.0826,7.5577,3.5596,8.5537,1.1161,5.9322,2.5255,0.437,0.534,2.2818,0.0265,0.0047,0.6524,3.4747,1.7168,0.8133,3.3811,3.9082,4.0355,6.4538,1.4363,5.8178,0.1426,4.2129,0.0138,0.5772,0.3456,2.2082,0.0181,9.714,1.1634,0.1535,0.0284,0.0116,0.0093,0.6606,4.3986,0.2381,0.0154,3.6874,10.8562,3.1286,1.8075,4.0559,1.9375,1.0389,4.3301,5.8028,3.4813,1.1109,2.8929,5.5923,0.4991,0.2003,2.9869,4.5006,0.072,2.1594,2.0624,0.5557,3.9821,0.3166,5.3095,3.8177,0.9333,0.214,0.908,3.7653,2.6186,0.4833,2.4889,1.4718,2.5215,2.5928,3.954,4.5784,0.9787,0.0154,1.6336,2.6262,0.2319,0.7861,1.1151,0.3989,2.7108,0.6874,0.1794,0.761,2.8652,3.1891,0.323,1.0513,0.0271,0.5636,2.8534,4.2874,1.4922,3.3628,5.2774,4.0376,4.9361,5.0781,1.4331,5.6109,0.5327,2.144,1.8159,2.522,1.8464,0.0403,0.3681,1.4394,0.0092,3.0722,4.2958,2.0697,5.2467,2.2075,1.0527,0.0002,0.0001,0.333,3.0192,1.2653,1.1797,3.1569,6.2583,6.4328,0.0045,0.5364,0.1104,2.1029,0.3259,0.4459,5.6759,0.0867,0.1935,0.0044,0.0075,1.8344,3.8057,1.9335,1.0947,4.4328,0.6619,6.2941,3.2093,3.4828,1.4475,0.0019,4.8141,2.7818,3.7275,1.0131,0.6274,2.6052,0.0002,5.5514,4.0838,0.1073,1.1734,4.4215,1.7149,1.5813,1.2366,3.5201,0.5574,5.5531,2.168,0.5759,4.4216,2.9402,5.1095,1.2611,1.6367,0.1264,0.039,2.593,0.0033,1.7936,5.4882,1.4566,0.8092,1.0648,3.2458,0.2208,2.7771,2.1565,0.1588,0.8153,3.8216,1.5414,3.0579,2.5172,0.4004,1.8661,0.3978,1.2331,0.0002,1.798,2.668,0.0002,0.0158,0.5854,0.0615,5.9056,5.5193,0.3326,2.2942,0.043,0.9705,5.5161,3.5262,3.9744,4.2603,3.1235,2.637,2.722,0.8843,0.0021,1.4587,4.1054,1.2334,0.115,2.8826,0.0084,4.6054,2.6861,0.3837,2.6968,3.1652,1.9209,4.9896,1.1858,1.5561,2.8942,1.2954,3.5621,0.3592,0.7227,0.9202,1.027,1.4634,5.0109,1.5994,2.4346,1.4953,0.2961,5.8554,0.0388,2.1237,4.2689,0.2338,0.0896,0.0555,1.6462,1.7855,2.3654,3.5143,2.0827,1.3862,5.3341,0.6014,4.0713,4.4991,6.5024,2.6649,3.7129,0.0012,0.0,3.0083,4.1641,0.348,0.9259,0.6208,5.4148,0.4556,5.397,0.0037,0.0,0.9019,4.5147,1.4031,2.7579,2.7613,3.7276,0.4595,4.5077,0.0001,0.7154,0.2857,0.2466,2.679,1.6272,3.2784,0.0175,3.3427,0.8201,3.8678,0.7523,5.1787,0.5695,1.0126,3.7107,0.0891,0.5314,0.0002,5.5194,1.8889,6.3474,4.1085,1.1463,0.6968,0.3817,3.9682,0.791,1.3052,0.0535,1.538,0.6222,1.9386,4.4017,6.5098,1.5337,1.6671,0.101,0.3353,1.2203,3.4778,0.9617,2.5487,1.2046,4.6654,4.1999,1.6853,0.5126,2.7816,4.8805,0.5575,0.667,3.5255,0.6705,4.0421,0.0026,1.3683,6.3744,5.1879,2.0855,4.7137,5.7132,0.4216,4.7006,4.3864,1.0042,0.3958,1.0254,0.3806,1.8056,0.7334,1.7989,2.3172,2.9024,0.4941,3.1819,2.5486,0.8775,0.4459,0.0888,0.0136,1.0468,5.8947,6.4283,1.9105,1.3154,1.6053,2.5797,1.7872,3.1186,0.9536,5.8857,1.4647,3.5206,0.7042,2.868,4.4766,0.6352,0.7915,2.1248,0.5095,4.2841,1.8376,3.8214,4.5842,2.1699,0.2818,0.2925,0.1007,0.8868,1.5796,3.1342,0.2772]}
{"id":3245,"ended":true,"length":370,"gen_text":"Depending on the player's chosen race and class, they will begin the game with one of six predetermined origin stories. In each origin story, the player is introduced to Duncan, your'adventurer, in a variety of different environments. These stories can differ greatly, depending on the player's choice and the race, class and skills provided for them to choose. The choices a character makes in these early life choices will remain with them for life.\n\n\nDuncan and his companions have to learn about life in the vast realm of Solstheim, where danger and danger-seeking exist alongside the opportunity for glory and fortune. The choices you make will determine which of your companions die and which live; what stories are told and which aren't; who you'll be. A great example: If you have a choice of two companions who join up with your quest, you will have both Duncan and his apprentice Eisengraaf, who will be present together from the start and never separate. Duncan will die, and there will be a new protagonist who is Eisengraaf's master.\n\n\nDuncan's adventures, both in Solstheim and the rest of Skyrim, will eventually lead him to a confrontation with Jarl Laila and her family. When this occurs, you will be asked to help one of the three siblings: Haelga (the older sister), Jorrvaskr, (the younger sister), or Septimus Signus (the father), in their struggle for the crown. It will be up to you to choose the character that is best suited for that particular mission, and this will determine which of three siblings Haelga, Jorvaskr and Septimus will support. The more choices you make on this particular quest - and the more of Duncan's life you take through it - the more influence Duncan will have in that family's future!\n\n\nThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim will be released later this year for the PC (Windows), PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.","token_len":409,"entropy":[0.0186,0.9728,6.1721,0.83,5.0388,2.8383,1.7999,1.468,0.2413,2.4405,1.3261,4.0723,1.1066,0.3609,0.5595,3.1268,1.359,3.3955,6.4141,9.5622,1.4632,0.8564,3.8093,2.4245,1.8087,0.1523,0.154,0.7255,0.3066,2.1969,2.8788,0.0304,13.4824,0.8485,8.0036,11.2026,4.3043,0.9724,0.0638,1.044,4.0664,1.0958,3.9436,0.0037,1.6384,2.9674,0.7757,2.3905,2.637,2.7404,5.318,1.4613,2.1373,1.9413,0.0614,0.4999,1.2758,0.0652,1.7172,2.5431,1.3841,3.362,3.1088,0.1325,1.051,4.2801,6.3734,3.3909,1.3105,3.8696,1.6081,2.057,2.3871,3.3285,4.1028,3.4957,0.0933,1.5254,1.902,4.3599,5.081,2.3716,1.0926,5.9667,0.8633,0.1667,2.003,4.0016,0.8226,3.4504,0.0002,1.7111,0.0631,3.5633,0.4927,1.424,2.8784,2.1611,2.8133,2.1774,3.4244,1.3923,0.8107,5.5743,5.2902,0.248,5.5772,2.2815,0.0024,1.0876,2.7753,4.3949,1.2399,2.3024,5.3844,2.8589,4.7843,3.0362,1.7234,3.7794,1.1763,3.601,0.6284,2.5396,0.143,2.252,2.6409,2.4586,0.0456,1.3302,1.8011,3.6461,1.5759,2.1757,1.3556,4.3868,1.6594,0.5847,0.7399,4.0739,3.3324,3.9142,2.0131,0.2023,1.1579,1.163,4.5514,0.0015,0.3387,2.8829,2.1711,4.0401,2.1938,3.5139,5.2913,3.6171,4.4747,4.8749,3.6301,0.4979,3.2034,0.8176,3.6476,1.0944,2.0636,0.9945,2.9654,5.4553,3.8396,0.6215,2.9816,3.4586,0.7092,1.6542,1.9463,1.8456,4.6423,4.361,0.0899,2.1029,4.4522,5.5165,3.876,2.2454,0.8135,2.3477,1.7861,1.9094,1.382,1.959,3.8994,7.2533,4.3688,0.1243,1.1594,3.5491,4.953,2.2017,0.6131,3.7552,0.9802,2.2325,1.7389,1.8404,5.4556,0.2852,0.0974,1.6742,2.1765,5.2848,2.5367,2.4468,4.1127,0.0017,0.0023,0.0054,0.0014,0.3688,4.7438,0.6142,1.3149,0.0002,1.468,0.0042,1.3736,3.492,3.9201,3.0495,1.0315,2.6462,0.003,0.0003,0.0603,1.8855,2.0467,0.0017,1.3842,0.1331,0.9835,5.2618,0.8837,0.4902,0.2383,1.9842,2.2491,0.094,3.2819,0.489,4.4683,0.0934,2.6007,1.0933,3.5005,0.7745,4.3765,2.5206,2.3779,0.0676,1.5581,0.7314,1.3892,2.5154,0.3278,4.7077,5.3939,0.1473,0.8178,2.6014,5.3659,3.4122,3.0951,3.4434,0.0005,3.0472,1.6183,3.5718,0.6369,0.1647,1.8551,3.6698,0.004,0.0015,0.0001,2.4975,3.926,0.1147,0.6303,1.1095,0.5213,0.1076,5.2669,0.7886,0.0063,0.0001,0.3929,0.0434,2.2357,2.4661,1.7381,1.2334,2.6506,1.694,1.8271,4.9886,0.9577,4.3901,2.0563,0.4516,0.4812,0.0032,0.0727,0.253,1.3109,2.3514,4.6766,2.4503,2.6007,1.1642,0.4727,1.5684,3.3817,2.1499,3.6039,1.6659,0.8782,4.1322,1.633,1.762,1.52,0.7778,4.6642,0.7943,4.5693,0.0019,0.005,0.7667,0.0485,3.7332,0.0627,0.0116,0.0008,2.1824,0.0424,0.0076,1.3243,2.6561,0.5132,3.0902,4.4867,3.492,0.202,0.0759,5.264,1.7637,4.0823,0.5245,5.725,1.1411,0.5959,0.5409,2.7781,4.6776,0.0669,1.9867,0.5506,3.9073,4.5816,2.2362,0.0689,0.0173,0.4217,3.5404,2.1039,0.3452,0.1011,1.3672,3.5992,2.4236,0.1031,2.0842,5.2451,0.3524,0.0003,2.392,3.0016,0.0102,1.4501,0.0196,0.0789,2.7764,0.9947,1.5607,4.7216,0.0595,0.0411,1.2533,0.84,0.3234,3.6203,1.1909,1.5546,0.8721,0.1045,0.5979,0.9198,0.2078,0.0018,0.3141]}
{"id":2579,"ended":false,"length":368,"gen_text":"During the Peasants'Revolt of 1381, rebels from Kent and Essex marched to London and, once admitted to the city, managed to capture the Tower of London. King Richard, fearing the fate of Charles in the coming civil war, ordered the rebels to be shot on site.\n\nIn 1381, the country was racked by a civil war that pitted the Lancastrian Henry Tudor against the Lancastrian Edward III. The king was killed in February after refusing to pay the ransom demanded by Edward III, and the fighting continued for eleven months until Richard III and King Edward were dead and the new ruler, Mary, was crowned. On 11 May, with the help of the king's brother, John, Henry had killed Richard and turned over the crown to Elizabeth Woodville, which led to her being crowned queen on 6 July.\n\nIn May 1403, Henry returned to England from France with the help of the French army and landed in the north, near the village of Dover. He quickly marched to York where he was accepted as King Richard's heir on 10 May 1403.\n\nHenry died in 1399, and Elizabeth took control of England and Scotland, although Richard's remains were never recovered. The last English king, Edward IV, was killed on 12 May 1485, probably in battle, whilst attempting to recapture the throne which had already passed into the hands of his son, Edward V.\n\nAs we look back on Henry VIII and the Tudor dynasty, we can see the same trends over and over again. They represent that the Tudor dynasty was built on a fragile basis, with the same underlying tensions at play throughout its history. It is very likely that if the political, social and cultural conditions in England had not been so deeply flawed in the early part of the 14th and Tudor periods, the Tudors would never have succeeded.\n\nFurther reading: 'The Tudors: Origins and Causes' by John Blundell\n\nImage by Matt Roper","token_len":409,"entropy":[0.8467,10.9327,3.6124,0.0183,0.283,10.6436,0.011,1.6157,1.4292,0.0218,0.4519,7.394,3.0313,6.7133,2.111,1.7455,5.0457,1.5239,0.9765,1.7172,3.8323,5.1774,9.0916,1.3431,0.3228,0.8837,0.2819,6.0238,0.0291,4.0412,0.8369,2.5197,0.5452,0.007,1.0161,4.613,1.908,3.1224,3.6964,1.6638,4.4038,0.1776,6.0736,5.3043,1.4053,5.7394,1.398,0.0364,0.1109,2.3076,0.882,3.4125,0.8422,0.3523,4.4734,1.5587,4.597,0.5368,1.7911,0.0109,2.7902,1.8628,2.795,0.3368,1.4084,6.2659,0.7509,5.0466,0.0765,1.5713,2.4764,0.0072,1.9853,2.7536,0.8663,2.0382,0.0324,0.4487,3.6433,1.5506,0.0011,0.1377,0.4913,1.4433,0.0031,0.0164,0.7647,0.4383,0.3731,1.2807,4.0167,1.6087,2.117,0.8855,4.5494,6.5502,4.1168,0.1324,3.0879,1.9894,2.5382,0.3563,0.3201,2.5664,1.3002,2.4454,1.5611,1.4103,5.6807,2.3901,1.0945,5.1364,0.4817,1.9535,3.5516,1.375,3.7776,5.7206,0.3527,2.9437,3.4139,2.7259,1.5052,3.9874,4.3327,0.9748,5.4755,1.0879,0.616,0.3631,0.3347,6.3008,4.7145,2.3599,1.0839,5.4524,0.8376,2.4205,0.0041,1.2285,5.6542,0.0339,1.697,0.6057,3.0279,0.8657,2.2775,5.1032,5.4059,3.1551,1.458,5.7058,2.7847,0.4961,1.5036,0.1419,4.0988,0.7807,0.0001,1.0769,5.5122,3.7252,0.0839,2.4247,1.5315,0.2956,1.6897,1.9284,3.4431,0.8733,0.6355,0.4726,0.0002,2.3893,3.9461,1.3162,3.0994,0.0886,1.8124,5.8141,0.357,1.1175,1.8987,1.2159,2.2111,1.5999,2.9782,0.0034,1.4732,0.6353,2.0414,1.4569,3.9963,1.0569,2.3611,2.2934,4.2256,3.0004,2.0188,2.3748,0.0201,3.8808,0.4359,1.6962,3.4075,3.7527,1.6206,2.2666,2.2643,0.4326,1.5606,5.4677,1.1773,2.9124,3.0358,1.021,1.1352,3.1573,3.4999,0.8389,0.9903,0.29,0.4003,1.4896,0.0002,1.7112,3.9952,1.4211,4.7205,0.349,1.2738,1.4004,2.5257,3.1692,3.441,0.1291,1.1621,2.3847,2.9444,1.8478,3.5061,4.3494,1.9678,4.0867,0.2396,1.8596,1.4858,0.4044,2.5608,3.59,2.5056,0.6765,1.6805,1.2082,0.4654,0.1442,1.0137,1.893,2.6368,3.5391,0.6532,0.1802,1.2461,1.6456,4.8592,2.7557,0.7934,1.9711,6.1454,3.5199,0.0481,3.476,0.0002,1.0863,0.776,4.7468,1.0568,4.3,1.3018,2.7839,0.8721,0.2526,0.001,0.5844,1.9029,0.6962,0.5171,0.1189,0.2355,0.7007,0.0002,4.8474,4.9632,3.8965,0.6556,1.325,2.4571,1.2466,2.464,1.4484,1.0238,0.5398,0.843,0.3357,0.855,1.6811,0.9949,2.2721,5.6757,4.5096,4.7318,0.269,0.0399,0.1942,0.6805,4.1197,5.5599,6.2468,4.3785,2.1829,0.64,0.9897,0.8686,3.1501,0.3825,1.4156,4.2918,4.4077,1.4886,2.9276,1.5555,5.7693,3.8916,2.8746,4.597,1.3509,2.0447,1.3997,0.6825,0.1732,2.9871,1.252,4.9542,1.6657,0.1249,3.5131,1.3096,4.8353,3.8474,0.8564,0.353,2.3317,1.7771,1.356,0.8206,0.5513,2.0108,0.5621,0.8876,4.4389,3.835,2.5489,0.2695,2.5982,2.9748,0.0017,0.1478,2.3399,0.0068,4.4646,5.5182,0.0063,1.5809,0.1306,1.304,0.4293,1.2545,0.4374,2.121,0.0184,2.4638,0.614,0.7063,0.0002,3.2163,0.3951,0.4789,3.4475,1.0811,1.0033,0.3589,1.099,5.3399,0.7407,4.9567,0.7434,0.1478,3.3453,5.3695,1.19,0.434,2.4531,0.0002,3.867,3.223,5.5834,4.3464,1.1486]}

The previous team, Renault, ran a second car, with drivers Raffaele Marciello, and Jean Alesi. The former had finished 3rd with two other teams in the European Grand Prix, but he didn't drive on Saturday. Alesi, who was with F1 team Renault at the time, is now a member of LMP1 squad Dragon Racing with which he has completed five LMP1 races this season.\n\nIn recent years, both the FIA and the ACO have taken notice of the German manufacturer and its unique racing style and the WEC has been a good platform during the development period.\n\nFernando Alonso said in a television interview that the Nurburgring should have a dedicated track like Spa-Francopants or Monza (both very popular for Spa). The Spaniard didn't reveal the specific test date, which will see a total of seven days of practice, five qualifying sessions and one race, which will take place this weekend at 8 PM local time (10 pm UTC \/ 12 noon EST \/ 4 pm PST \/ 1 am BST \/ Sunday New Zealand time )\n\nAfter this test, Ferrari can then prepare for the 24 Hours of Nurburgring World Endurance Championship and the 24 Hours of Le Mans, on February 21, 26 and 28, 2015 respectively. Ferrari has recently announced the appointment of Marco Mattiacci as its Head of Automobiles Development with the goal to bring the best technology from Ferrari to its road cars by 2016.\n\nPhoto credits: Daniel Schmidt, Sebastian Schipper","token_len":411,"entropy":[9.73,6.3398,2.5874,1.5385,3.0289,2.4539,6.314,8.6499,4.2568,5.0185,0.003,2.7545,11.027,1.3685,2.6616,1.3321,2.1228,1.628,4.7146,11.7613,7.7742,11.35,6.5643,4.1822,14.9383,2.8678,0.2871,9.8161,5.8149,9.0575,4.7424,2.1401,3.3189,0.7393,8.7929,1.2011,0.0122,0.0001,2.4127,4.4597,0.8817,2.0441,0.3893,5.0264,0.7274,2.5707,3.12,1.379,4.054,4.0271,0.0007,0.0035,0.0005,2.6324,2.5979,0.8821,2.8352,4.3417,2.1656,4.1865,1.89,3.5571,2.1823,5.5521,1.4589,6.0134,0.1448,3.7473,0.0014,2.0238,1.3969,2.9247,0.923,0.7466,1.3604,0.0258,4.8168,4.9632,0.0005,0.5528,0.6041,0.3423,1.093,3.1973,1.8686,2.2495,4.3435,0.1556,2.4405,1.4007,1.1129,2.3931,0.3911,0.0045,0.0,1.0144,2.048,5.1098,5.493,2.1317,3.6168,0.2174,3.462,1.4121,5.1277,2.6091,3.3379,2.8478,4.6093,4.6756,3.567,0.0126,0.0,0.0067,0.0004,0.0015,2.8973,5.3117,2.85,0.1542,0.0003,2.01,1.6417,4.4426,2.8333,4.1964,3.6101,0.0298,5.149,4.5205,2.7465,3.3338,1.1918,0.6253,5.2887,2.3489,0.0014,1.5659,2.3375,3.1857,2.204,0.0005,3.8941,3.7575,3.1633,0.5782,3.6679,0.0304,1.891,1.3976,1.5873,4.4181,5.673,0.3251,2.1005,2.7598,1.6765,0.1005,0.4366,0.2022,3.8487,1.3597,1.783,3.4524,0.0079,5.6099,1.8182,0.2931,2.4994,4.404,0.4231,4.4022,2.2418,0.6554,2.2111,4.2221,3.9225,4.7588,0.0126,0.1923,0.6456,2.0274,0.7389,0.23,0.3298,0.0004,3.574,4.6607,0.382,0.4866,4.0143,2.1507,3.222,0.1317,1.0974,0.5501,0.0045,0.3226,3.4218,4.3788,0.0741,0.2588,4.5774,1.3695,2.9852,1.6915,5.2862,4.0727,3.0984,2.7936,3.2112,4.7332,0.6313,1.1694,1.606,1.9696,2.5547,1.6778,7.903,1.6311,1.8281,3.5829,0.5299,1.4944,0.0003,3.2103,4.706,0.002,0.0007,4.9167,2.979,1.2374,6.9263,0.046,1.1975,1.5589,4.3811,0.1274,0.0048,0.0002,5.2555,3.1063,1.7305,4.6053,1.5771,5.3413,1.6077,0.8257,0.0012,6.1838,0.0951,2.7066,1.4965,0.0004,4.6907,2.3815,6.0973,2.3318,3.3387,5.1813,2.6834,2.1619,1.5675,0.0038,4.7023,0.0005,4.4901,2.0698,3.4419,4.7554,1.7054,0.7983,4.2518,1.5191,4.9872,2.8324,2.4046,0.0374,3.6849,3.7175,0.5502,5.0217,1.1951,3.8408,2.3161,0.4941,0.6953,1.7559,0.585,2.4765,1.7031,0.6035,1.3529,0.0065,4.5239,0.5807,2.0744,3.6227,3.5232,0.7622,0.0591,1.2193,4.2028,3.6058,1.9867,3.6791,3.1145,4.2905,1.728,0.8697,2.3372,0.8322,0.983,1.9778,2.879,0.514,2.8012,0.7958,4.8024,6.8088,0.7614,0.4193,6.0585,1.8863,0.0003,4.8018,3.4163,1.2975,0.1976,1.6637,5.5672,3.2829,2.0881,0.4144,0.5532,2.9381,0.1117,0.0143,4.9073,0.0816,0.0019,0.0041,5.7994,0.1472,0.1032,4.1552,0.9027,1.6292,0.0476,0.038,0.0529,0.0023,1.2428,5.2199,3.8695,2.6373,2.3665,4.5183,0.4704,1.1863,0.8645,1.8979,1.7792,0.1015,4.9324,1.9367,4.7245,1.7425,2.3342,3.3433,0.0286,3.2077,0.0417,0.0005,0.0015,0.5585,1.1784,2.5966,0.0304,4.0657,3.2652,3.1832,3.9613,1.0592,1.8537,1.5454,3.796,1.3546,2.7031,2.4955,2.1749,2.4362,0.8611,2.8228,2.7199,0.3666,4.0573,2.4731,0.1375,0.7158,0.0003,3.4598,2.9828,0.1476,5.1798,5.2936,1.4534,4.7015,4.3261,1.7863]}

The Vittorio Emanuele, a new Italian division, had been trained in Russia and had received large quantities of equipment from the Germans and Austrians.

The judges chose the novel for making the small reader feel as if he are experiencing true human emotion and felt able to respond to the novel because of the reader's '''` experience''.\n\n\" '`When You Reach Me'' describes a family in which children have autism and is written in a simple, direct style. The first and second chapters are simple, yet the tone and message of the story change continuously throughout. ''`The story has a storybook feel to it that encourages the reader to think inside the story and understand concepts and the development of the characters. ''`In each chapter, children encounter a new challenge such as discovering what they want for their birthday, learning how to make a card for Santa, or learning the meaning of ''`the holidays. ''`\n\n\" `` `What really impressed us about the book is the author's ability to capture the simplicity of the experiences of the child with autism who struggles to communicate his feelings. It takes the novel's opening sentence, ''`a boy named ''` and turns it into a story about a young boy with autism and his family. The reader is able to relate to his character,'' ` the judge said. `This ability to capture the lives of the children in the novel is what appeals to young readers. This ability to capture simple, human emotions is a great attribute of the author.''\n\n`` ```We are extremely pleased with the Newbery medal as well,'''she continued. ` `This is the fifth year that Stacey and her husband, Mr. David Stead, have been nominated, and last year the Steads were awarded Newbery and their novel was picked by the editors of Reader's Digest.

The Award represents a milestone for Stacey and her family, something they could not have imagined,'' she said.\n\n###","token_len":413,"entropy":[7.401,10.7818,1.3899,7.2043,5.5205,4.6762,0.5953,9.5412,15.1892,3.387,4.6657,0.8767,2.5477,1.0491,3.1554,0.0029,15.4734,8.9767,2.7167,5.0657,0.0744,1.2775,0.7088,5.9441,0.4502,5.5566,1.8391,2.2953,5.3453,4.8391,1.3464,2.2787,1.3458,8.0172,2.6311,7.3333,2.4106,0.9272,2.3876,0.6968,1.0863,6.0175,3.5077,6.5516,3.3832,1.3699,2.2618,5.6285,5.599,0.0184,4.8108,0.8552,1.029,3.1186,4.1581,0.7355,0.9169,4.9283,0.0924,9.5665,5.8294,5.7463,4.6504,5.4521,1.9381,0.0259,3.714,7.2221,2.0521,3.0688,0.1863,0.0051,0.0011,1.5214,5.8223,1.019,3.497,2.1576,1.2603,4.3111,2.451,5.3353,1.2154,4.1037,2.1144,1.0414,0.9036,2.5841,0.9621,2.305,1.251,1.4518,1.158,4.6291,4.2545,1.2042,1.2387,1.2773,4.0171,1.6242,3.3568,1.5498,6.0533,1.6349,3.8015,1.2135,0.1664,1.49,2.773,6.4755,1.0279,1.1693,4.3451,0.2975,1.6308,1.916,3.9405,1.1727,4.9957,2.6713,0.9611,1.171,0.0179,3.5441,3.973,1.3004,0.2142,0.061,3.5548,6.4606,0.4145,0.6943,1.0926,4.2503,6.623,2.6209,4.5689,5.3051,0.1104,0.9225,0.7838,0.9037,2.2535,0.0191,4.1799,4.6675,0.3444,0.6172,3.671,4.3054,1.3765,0.8361,3.7142,4.598,0.0055,5.7181,3.4587,2.4328,2.3599,2.5472,2.1057,0.9774,0.7009,2.5632,1.6916,0.0491,3.2366,0.8943,5.6465,2.0513,2.5052,0.5107,0.9007,2.405,3.1339,2.1013,0.0368,3.7861,0.3862,3.1221,4.7389,2.853,0.4511,0.018,1.6792,0.0002,0.8642,3.3296,2.0648,5.3943,3.4845,2.5693,1.9167,1.0765,1.116,0.7479,1.1987,1.2508,3.0286,0.1058,0.7252,0.0131,3.1901,0.4274,5.695,0.491,1.303,4.9188,0.5674,2.0054,2.7991,1.4838,0.1004,4.7152,3.6817,0.9987,1.2896,2.8125,1.2633,1.4516,2.9424,4.6861,1.8746,6.8731,2.253,5.8579,3.7037,1.1546,0.8518,0.0762,4.2413,2.0021,2.2417,4.446,0.0418,2.9555,1.2453,0.0894,0.1763,0.5364,2.08,1.3238,1.0807,2.9891,0.4398,2.5711,0.0941,2.4923,0.6758,1.0139,0.6966,1.6611,2.3237,0.9534,1.5593,0.0071,2.2771,0.1723,3.9023,3.3674,6.6231,2.1593,6.6681,3.9697,0.7578,0.1143,3.0103,4.5243,4.0806,0.3528,2.0281,0.4605,5.8105,0.1541,1.1837,1.7631,2.5996,0.4117,1.3441,1.0823,1.7917,6.6631,0.1141,4.5973,0.1422,1.3493,3.378,3.7492,0.5864,1.5804,4.9337,1.4722,2.9198,0.7548,1.4153,2.4864,2.7746,5.1062,1.7945,1.5863,1.5974,2.877,0.6462,0.0002,2.2503,4.4905,1.8601,3.3438,1.299,3.5435,1.2014,1.1684,0.3437,1.5486,0.033,4.2997,4.9545,2.1877,8.4124,4.2344,9.0779,2.0936,0.1348,1.0843,3.5141,2.6276,1.1401,1.1032,2.675,1.9193,1.5056,6.2165,1.6438,2.7789,1.4192,0.8501,1.2273,5.0834,0.0155,3.6763,2.1355,0.2219,0.1124,1.0427,2.291,3.7013,0.2395,4.5469,0.0193,2.5379,1.7266,0.7029,1.0989,1.4909,4.7955,0.0249,3.5042,4.7187,1.2746,1.4547,5.0022,1.5691,0.4517,5.3728,0.511,4.7696,0.0139,0.0019,1.8968,2.5667,1.8357,0.2254,1.185,0.6211,1.9511,2.4171,0.4503,4.2284,0.4749,1.3173,0.5269,0.1872,1.7888,1.8851,0.3219,3.4033,0.7695,1.8445,5.6927,4.7751,1.7123,4.4119,1.3996,1.9586,0.0019,0.5126,0.7169,0.9532,1.5336,6.4655,1.244,4.1369,0.471,0.1061,1.345,6.4559,2.7607,0.4637,0.0708,0.5492,0.0002,4.5491]}

Library CEO Judith Hare stated that the space would complement the school's curriculum in music and math to provide opportunities for students to work together to create meaningful projects. In addition to the auditorium, the auditorium is also utilized to accommodate public art, a classroom, and other space needs.\n\n\"With this commitment, [the library] becomes one of the strongest and most well-respected institutions in the country for early childhood education. This will give our community a significant opportunity to build a better tomorrow,\" said President David R. Leebron.\n\nThe addition of K-12 schools is only part of the library's plans to diversify its offerings. In partnership with the University of Michigan Library's Center for School Services, the library has completed a three-year $2.5 million project to create an entirely new library branch, one capable of holding more than 1.3 million volumes. The new branch also includes five classrooms, a learning center, and community use spaces.\n\nAdditionally, the library has reached a $100,000 goal on its KickStarter project to fund a mobile service center, a new location that will replace the current space on South Street where the library is located. When completed, the service center will extend into the new library branch on the east side of campus.\n\nAbout the Michigan Libraries Foundation and the Michigan Libraries\n\nThe Michigan Libraries Foundation (MLF) is a private, philanthropic organization dedicated to improving the quality of library services and resources for Michigan's residents.

{"id":3009,"ended":true,"length":385,"gen_text":"The final hurricane of the season was first observed on October 4 by a ship off the southeast coast of North Carolina. With winds estimated at 105 mph ( 165 km \/ h ) and sustained sustained winds of 100 mph (160 km \/h), the hurricane made landfall in eastern North Carolina with heavy rainfall and powerful gusts across the state.\n\nAs the hurricane moved across eastern North Carolina, the tropical storm threat gradually decreased as low-level troughs swept up from the Gulf of Mexico and over the Appalachian Mountain, providing the hurricane much less chance of becoming a direct strike threat. The next significant change was the emergence of tropical depression 14. On October 6, the tropical system weakened to a tropical depression with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (113 km\/h). A few days later, on October 12, the system dropped to a tropical depression with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (97 km\/h).\n\nThis system was not considered to be a significant threat and was moved offshore. However on October 19, an upper trough merged with the system, providing additional storm-surge potential for the system. By late Sunday, the system reached the coast of southern North Carolina, with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph (48 km\/h). Winds from 80-115 mph (130-200 km\/h) were reported near the center of the system over the next three days.\n\nThe next major tropical system to forecast to originate across the Atlantic basin this season entered the area on Monday October 26.

{"id":141,"ended":true,"length":347,"gen_text":"The director's original cut of Sholay has a different ending in which Thakur kills Gabbar, along with some additional violent scenes. Gabbar's death scene, and the scene in which the movie's main protagonist Rajeev Shukla ( Bipasha Basu ) finds himself in with Roshan Khaitan and Suman Sethi ( Amit Roshan and Irrfan Khan ) is one of those scenes where the audience was shocked \u2014 and the movie's soundtrack is the strongest example of this. For a moment, he's completely out of options: If he shoots Thakur or saves Gabbar, he will surely be killed. But Rajeev can't do anything but shoot Khaitan. He can't help himself. Rajeev is the hero of the movie for one more time.\nWith Gabbar still alive, Rajeev tries to save Khaitan, with little success. In its original cut, the scene looks as though the gun ends up being fired at Gabbar instead of Roshan and Suman. But once the audience got their fix for Roshan vs Roshan, they realized this wasn't really the case. It's as if Roshan had already shot Gabbar in his first scene (in which he's gunned down by the cop), and then the movie has taken its dramatic license (and the rest of the film) with Gabbar killing Roshan \u2014 who was already dead by then \u2014 after trying to shoot him several times.\nRajeev's final scene is more intense as he realizes he can't stop Khaitan from killing Gabbar. And then, he shoots Khaitan with a pistol, after he himself is shot. The film ends with Naseeruddin Shah as Gabbar, but with an extra twist: Gabbar has somehow escaped the clutches of Roshan and Suman and is now running away from them. He has no idea how he did it, but everyone will surely remember what happens during the credits.","token_len":416,"entropy":[7.6996,2.615,5.775,3.1561,0.9388,7.8196,6.3435,0.4007,3.0545,2.4319,4.3489,0.5998,3.825,0.8103,7.29,2.0898,0.2999,5.131,10.1835,0.2344,2.1424,6.5851,0.0073,4.9428,4.4791,7.8698,0.6038,0.641,6.4282,0.0008,0.8911,1.8744,2.4125,2.511,4.4836,0.8129,3.0783,1.7897,0.1524,2.3933,5.3248,1.5052,2.7003,2.944,4.5942,5.004,0.0067,5.6428,0.2685,0.0005,1.4155,9.6424,1.5747,0.007,0.0053,0.0003,0.092,4.869,2.0699,1.5199,8.3269,6.2728,3.3511,0.0585,5.6285,4.5748,0.1731,2.4936,4.2475,3.0974,5.4197,1.0735,0.9776,4.8299,5.1715,1.2952,0.0107,0.1642,5.3273,0.0041,0.0002,0.0293,1.1006,1.5814,3.3093,0.1158,4.1378,0.6762,3.1184,0.9383,3.4108,3.6789,4.025,5.607,1.819,2.2054,2.5632,1.152,4.9623,2.4783,3.4278,5.8512,3.8108,0.2116,1.4063,0.521,5.4683,2.1913,3.5768,0.3116,6.6111,2.062,4.5413,2.7892,0.0446,5.995,3.1487,4.0026,0.2602,3.2551,3.4808,0.0006,0.0013,3.4088,4.9272,1.0722,0.0006,0.1442,0.6816,2.2007,4.0153,0.883,1.0177,1.7841,1.568,3.8562,0.0056,0.0032,3.7997,0.2002,1.9218,1.1685,3.0283,2.4829,3.8362,0.0498,0.0003,2.0797,2.8129,2.1098,0.202,4.1799,1.3608,0.6214,4.4216,0.0051,0.0015,1.9889,2.8536,1.7512,1.5074,0.3687,0.7729,5.1993,4.7963,4.0377,4.0542,0.6925,0.9032,9.346,3.7998,0.0004,5.1935,0.5328,0.1998,0.941,0.0017,0.0013,4.0937,0.1764,2.2262,2.8092,0.0116,0.0001,1.5086,5.285,2.4923,0.2678,0.149,3.5141,6.745,0.9789,1.2379,0.2425,1.2998,1.7155,5.7751,3.1431,1.3468,2.8012,3.4831,5.1164,0.1402,2.4321,1.7594,2.1541,1.2281,0.0004,2.4825,0.5538,2.8226,0.0057,0.002,2.0183,0.5824,0.0248,0.3595,2.1994,5.1563,1.2595,2.6946,4.2608,4.6152,2.3986,3.4238,3.6387,0.0306,0.0039,6.8551,4.8387,0.5329,0.0165,0.4977,1.5463,3.4306,3.8561,2.0122,0.0001,3.4726,0.7153,0.119,0.2895,2.8644,1.1934,3.9271,0.4318,2.6289,0.0094,0.0021,2.3936,3.9007,1.6712,0.3838,0.0012,2.6734,3.2513,2.2626,1.4644,4.4049,2.798,1.4497,0.4807,2.1175,5.4458,0.014,0.7878,2.4578,4.7983,1.2009,0.6134,1.7266,2.7425,3.2439,4.108,3.637,4.0372,5.8476,2.1651,5.5486,1.7888,1.9726,5.1116,0.2076,0.1239,1.5626,0.6599,2.0517,1.9072,0.0006,6.5021,0.5942,0.0006,0.0006,3.9181,3.8178,2.0185,2.0604,0.6492,2.1386,1.4049,2.3749,3.8833,5.44,0.0513,2.6507,0.9958,5.1206,0.1403,0.2876,1.0573,3.264,0.2246,0.0018,0.0017,1.4568,2.6468,1.8936,1.5708,5.2251,4.3101,4.8884,0.9535,3.4086,1.7728,2.0198,0.1504,4.0075,0.9478,0.0007,0.0001,0.8,0.6026,0.527,0.0009,0.4555,3.4987,2.5904,1.2509,2.1121,1.7429,0.7597,0.0007,0.0002,3.4272,1.3979,2.3858,1.6069,4.2565,2.712,5.9616,1.42,0.8228,1.8618,1.9671,3.5168,1.2773,0.3728,7.5685,1.5439,0.0016,0.9254,0.001,3.6564,2.4042,0.0004,1.4269,5.1368,2.3734,3.298,1.9594,2.3023,0.5939,1.1833,0.0008,2.3235,4.1567,3.5007,2.1551,2.5078,0.0001,0.0016,1.8248,0.0045,0.0013,0.6947,0.3518,0.0085,1.8134,0.5965,1.4628,2.9545,1.4008,1.0951,1.309,0.7472,2.7537,3.1421,2.2004,1.1013,2.5888,0.834,3.7347,0.1927,0.6667,0.7022,6.3867,5.0964,3.6079,3.0673,4.1871,2.1581,6.0671,0.7015,1.6664,0.7485]}

Technology is used to give audiences what they're looking for, or better yet, it gives them what they need.\n\nIn the theatre, we know that audiences can't see what we've done, with a simple look, they know it's going to be good. We also know that audiences want to be a part of our journey, like our friends do, and are willing to give up their cell phones, and laptops, and give up time with everyone, to go to a show and participate.\n\nPeople have made some of the best movies of the 21st century, based on things they saw on their phones or on the stage, on a film screen or screen projector.\n\nWe know that our audience can be influenced by what they've seen on one screen.

They're going to be inspired to do more, because they know now, this technology's out there, and it's changing our society.\n\nIt's no secret that technology can influence our society, and what our society thinks makes up for the truth is what we want to believe, so the movie theatre can become the next step for how we think is the future.\n\nWhat's your take on the Google Glass?\n\nWhat do you think about the technology of Google Glass?","token_len":418,"entropy":[1.1467,7.7758,1.2343,1.2542,1.6228,8.3998,7.1282,0.5084,0.6372,2.6345,0.1416,8.212,0.0877,0.0001,0.0234,1.6539,3.3459,2.8223,1.3073,9.7602,0.8556,6.8942,0.1379,1.839,0.0,0.0003,0.0028,4.6441,0.3268,5.94,11.2947,9.4695,0.3294,2.4843,0.0915,5.076,5.5978,0.6688,6.7319,3.0205,2.2497,0.6369,5.5385,1.7595,3.175,2.3435,0.1861,5.5688,1.7037,5.4793,3.5679,1.2335,0.1942,0.0031,1.0043,0.2072,6.6447,0.0083,1.5275,3.4961,3.7813,0.3236,6.3899,0.019,4.1503,3.6176,5.7623,2.1752,2.4514,4.5516,2.1239,5.7474,3.9904,4.8131,1.5219,2.7481,0.3558,0.3059,0.0002,4.3228,3.1927,2.944,0.7633,1.1706,5.8793,0.0918,2.0773,2.8448,0.0483,1.0012,1.1514,0.2175,1.5636,1.429,0.4285,0.3756,0.8974,2.6786,0.0002,1.7727,4.369,5.5218,2.9595,2.0632,5.5916,0.2192,5.0746,5.0626,1.4501,3.336,4.8183,0.3855,2.7605,4.8837,0.6139,1.2308,5.6855,1.4098,3.6976,0.615,4.518,2.1724,4.4898,0.1243,3.9799,0.5277,0.0091,1.1565,4.4598,4.1955,0.2538,0.2546,4.1221,3.1824,0.3636,0.5602,0.0171,2.4283,0.8895,0.9131,0.0002,3.0811,0.9898,2.6908,0.9292,2.1844,4.4227,0.7186,2.6262,3.1743,1.7226,1.3081,1.5026,1.2034,4.685,1.9217,1.2678,7.1933,3.0594,4.989,3.59,1.9196,2.0906,1.7172,3.15,0.345,3.3877,0.1318,0.1863,1.9654,0.2957,2.7624,3.0996,0.1597,0.3305,2.9538,2.3303,0.2667,1.4391,3.7666,0.0157,0.0063,2.769,3.6806,0.9738,5.9558,4.4143,5.5037,4.4468,2.3321,1.1342,4.9315,1.8677,0.0104,3.9551,1.5174,0.9767,5.1558,0.4231,2.1825,2.4068,4.8402,0.8735,1.4459,5.8463,1.086,3.5512,1.2686,6.8378,4.0435,1.2084,3.491,1.439,1.566,1.3513,3.2787,4.3589,0.966,0.3561,0.0002,5.8965,3.0174,5.1531,5.2363,3.2502,0.1235,1.5293,2.373,2.0752,1.2871,2.4762,0.0202,0.1173,1.7229,4.8706,0.1667,4.9963,0.9786,1.0121,1.104,2.1623,1.2442,2.2645,2.7547,1.1068,3.9242,1.6402,4.6578,2.8907,4.5761,1.5066,1.5668,5.1194,4.3308,0.407,1.4118,0.0002,2.7536,2.3729,0.5062,3.4059,2.0687,2.5292,2.8105,4.7086,0.4702,1.1481,0.6603,3.6508,0.1659,1.2233,6.4267,0.7454,2.6327,4.3175,1.4073,3.0224,4.7021,0.5999,2.7765,5.8697,2.2036,1.7813,0.2003,4.3064,4.1212,6.222,2.1834,5.7896,2.0475,4.2171,1.0513,5.6972,0.6111,6.1102,2.5238,5.0436,4.7647,0.5291,6.5397,0.4611,1.2782,6.5678,0.1901,0.1954,5.3452,1.9004,2.6683,0.0357,4.889,2.3477,5.4307,2.3164,6.0859,3.2439,6.0722,0.7328,0.9539,4.5129,1.1142,0.3832,0.0193,2.5894,4.8883,0.9574,2.5733,2.0904,1.7097,2.9587,0.584,2.865,5.2209,2.2304,3.9954,2.365,4.6253,3.2435,0.0573,1.127,1.026,1.1567,0.366,3.1163,2.0021,2.2391,0.3045,0.2528,0.0002,3.0407,0.3666,4.3252,2.0264,0.152,2.3426,3.3084,2.9898,1.347,1.6263,0.9502,1.0517,4.2627,4.1423,0.4168,3.0988,7.3581,2.7997,3.0433,1.549,5.5936,2.8007,2.0763,0.9251,2.8559,0.2638,0.5009,1.9926,3.0781,2.8553,5.782,1.6918,2.4868,2.7862,1.1474,0.5572,3.1963,1.85,3.9436,0.8959,3.0419,6.259,1.8347,1.7219,0.777,0.4464,0.0002,3.5102,2.5266,1.8895,1.1386,0.2487,1.1078,1.495,0.0276,1.0563,1.7582,0.0001,2.7357,0.495,0.0196,0.035,1.0977,0.4704,4.2598,2.7581,0.5699,0.0125,0.2654]}

As a result, Six Flags was to destroy the track, track parts, and the train cars, save for the use of the pieces for the roller coaster build.\nIn early 2011, there was a change in Six Flags' plans, and the track remained on the site as it had originally been. Also, while the train cars were to be buried on site, they were to be recovered by the park after the building of the new roller coasters.\nAt the end of the day, the roller coaster track was left behind as planned, as the only way Six Flags will be able to get their hands on these items without any type of legal ramifications is if those involved work together and work at Six Flags Magic Mountain.\nAnd that's as clear as day.\nThe reason these items were supposed to be thrown-away and then rusted-out was because it would be impossible, and Six Flags would not be able to continue to operate their rides in this state.\nThe plans were never implemented, and the items never left Six Flags Magic Mountain, and that's what is keeping the items from being thrown away.\nIt is time for Six Flags to stop covering over history, or it will be history itself for the parks.","token_len":418,"entropy":[4.5964,3.5197,0.2909,3.7387,0.1356,9.7305,1.3097,2.3966,0.0006,4.9656,1.8315,1.4396,5.6337,0.0255,2.6194,2.2021,17.8316,7.5177,6.2227,7.8234,3.1651,0.5386,7.3375,6.4994,2.2806,5.1284,1.7939,4.46,3.1979,0.0254,1.0087,4.9605,0.1248,3.6419,0.4983,2.1733,0.0983,0.0015,2.5244,0.7043,1.3701,5.0383,1.4916,2.9471,1.1575,0.3198,1.8306,7.4115,0.9224,3.093,4.3317,4.5554,4.2029,1.0336,3.3784,0.7622,3.2086,0.8203,1.5036,0.2685,0.0592,1.159,5.9286,5.3315,1.3718,3.8207,1.4086,1.6527,3.1406,2.5858,4.4307,5.1,5.2571,2.7064,3.1396,4.6028,0.071,1.9114,2.0627,2.5433,5.5961,4.6401,3.5424,0.1058,1.1366,1.8825,4.7225,0.7911,5.1052,0.2028,5.0398,4.6326,1.845,2.6109,2.3962,0.3153,0.2461,0.0041,1.7635,0.5962,4.9608,4.6704,2.9942,0.0021,4.6953,0.6064,4.0802,0.7859,3.1102,0.388,5.1895,2.3882,1.388,0.9716,5.1647,5.7173,0.5633,1.7971,5.1827,2.5392,5.4608,4.0678,5.7525,2.9234,4.9203,0.9338,4.0968,1.7909,2.6356,5.3327,0.7942,5.917,0.0076,5.9575,0.0069,1.2876,2.1699,3.6563,4.0048,0.0068,5.5475,1.763,0.9634,0.8173,1.904,3.3225,0.1731,3.8819,2.0412,1.6617,0.1013,5.7892,4.4711,2.2097,3.5399,8.2728,2.2928,5.1011,0.015,0.8667,2.2068,0.0129,0.8987,0.3615,0.4082,0.1029,2.0344,5.1183,2.9233,1.0057,0.3228,3.8486,0.0018,2.874,2.7337,5.5156,0.5543,2.0891,1.745,3.8845,3.8431,0.2243,0.4443,1.9496,4.7602,0.9889,1.6453,4.1281,1.1588,0.5431,5.259,0.0394,1.0576,5.1773,1.8017,1.4232,3.372,0.1431,5.4081,0.9288,0.8646,3.0048,2.8099,2.5497,0.0651,4.8115,0.6541,1.1532,3.8198,0.7238,4.4235,0.0027,1.2119,1.2118,1.3544,0.9594,0.7555,2.5411,5.6977,2.9686,0.669,0.7848,2.7189,2.6442,1.5004,4.3703,0.1631,1.677,6.1729,0.4466,4.2091,0.7082,2.7923,0.2496,0.7131,1.2251,0.1472,5.9535,4.2045,0.5663,0.2646,1.6803,0.2779,0.8164,0.0967,4.7599,2.5187,1.3437,0.8692,4.1676,0.4149,6.2068,0.9496,0.3769,0.5614,0.6027,0.9265,0.0054,1.1289,0.4059,4.021,0.4955,1.1996,0.0018,2.334,1.9465,0.2298,1.0864,2.3847,0.0703,1.8414,1.0792,3.0939,3.5872,2.8417,2.9331,0.6163,3.2369,1.7644,4.3177,3.252,2.8583,0.0011,5.5314,0.887,0.1374,0.0037,3.1003,4.611,0.8799,0.0099,4.0578,3.0003,5.2277,4.5033,4.8674,0.0043,1.9978,3.3089,0.6411,0.5942,6.0759,2.1275,5.964,2.0852,1.6647,3.7919,4.6649,1.4039,0.001,1.4394,0.0048,1.2732,0.4521,5.3262,2.226,0.893,6.2998,6.1481,0.4219,2.4723,0.9693,0.6698,2.2183,4.4477,4.6376,0.9938,0.9128,5.8353,0.0028,0.0946,2.228,6.3078,0.5394,2.8286,2.5959,5.2847,0.0324,0.7864,0.0997,2.014,0.8649,3.1899,1.9479,1.372,2.4406,4.5965,2.791,5.1253,0.0036,1.7241,1.8585,0.8753,0.4685,0.0154,5.4651,1.8173,1.4937,2.9499,3.6196,2.8389,3.4901,1.3855,0.7932,0.7172,2.0916,5.7169,1.8706,3.2473,3.3406,0.7735,0.7518,1.0884,3.5365,4.2334,1.5207,2.4684,0.0011,0.9966,0.0098,1.8707,1.4101,4.2659,0.5064,2.6959,3.1632,3.9189,1.1348,3.2332,1.1368,0.2666,2.7908,1.2038,0.6747,0.2117,3.1972,1.8799,5.1726,0.7104,0.3963,0.0013,0.3867,2.7474,4.4699,4.8132,4.8215,1.1099,4.9547,4.0174,0.492,1.1514,3.6124,1.4652,4.4615,1.6338,4.8938,1.4033]}
{"id":147,"ended":false,"length":345,"gen_text":"On 14 June 2004, Stansfield returned to the Conference with Hereford United, signed by Graham Turner to replace their previous season's top scorer Steve Guinan, who had been sold to Cheltenham.\n\nGraham Turner was the fourth new manager to be put in charge at Hereford United in 2001; Tony Broughton also spent two previous spells in charge.\n\nThe departure of a top scorer could not have gone smoother for Stansfield. Hereford had been playing some good and exciting football during the previous three seasons, and Stansfield had enjoyed coaching at the club. With the exception of his four years at Northampton Town, Graham Turner knew the league as a player. With the addition of Guinan on deadline day, Stansfield had a new striker, the man of the future for Hereford United.\n\nAfter a disastrous first season with Hereford, Stansfield enjoyed more successful second spells with Gloucester and Cheltenham during the 2004\/05 and 2005\/06 seasons. As part of his stint in the Premier League, he guided Cambridge United to safety in his first season as head coach in 2005\/06, while in 2006\/07, when Hereford reached the final of the Championship, Stansfield steered the club towards Premier League promotion. From there, Hereford stayed in the Championship through the remainder of Stansfield's playing days, despite occasional visits to the top flight.\n\nAfter a four-year spell in charge of Northampton Town, Graham Turner returned to Hereford United at the end of 2005. Stansfield then guided Hereford to promotion from the Conference via the play-offs in his only season in charge.

{"id":890,"ended":false,"length":357,"gen_text":"The New York Mets selected deGrom in the ninth round as a pitcher, with the 272nd overall selection, of the 2010 MLB Draft. He signed with the Mets, receiving a $1,000,000 signing bonus. The Mets assigned deGrom to their minor league camp in June and then he debuted on July 1 at Tampa Bay.\nAn All-Star in his first year of major league baseball, deGrom is now 7-5 with a 2.82 ERA and a.219 opponents' batting average. He has made four All-Star team appearances and has won three World Series titles (2008, 2011 & 2014). He led the National League with nine shutouts this season and finished with nine wins on the season, good enough for second with a 4.01 innings pitched per start.\nHe signed with the Mets after the 2010 Baseball Futures Game, his seventh appearance in the Futures Games, and made his MLB debut that summer against Atlanta, going six innings allowing only two runs on three hits and no walks. He also had five strikeouts and only two walks against his major league debut.\nWhile he may be the oldest player in the major leagues, he will become the oldest in a Mets uniform when he is called up in September.\nDeGrom made his major league debut in the Mets' 2012 NLDS defeat of the Florida Marlins (5 innings, only earned run on two hits...three strikeouts and four walks). He was 6-4 with a 3.41 ERA and a.225 opponents' batting average in 27 starts.

The final re-airing in the United States of the interview occurred on March 18, 2012 in Italy on RAI. A special preview of this interview has been recorded and will be broadcasted on a future evening on NBC. In Italy, the interview has been viewed more than 5.4 million times thus far during its live premiere on March 18, 2012, and during the following week on March 25, 2012.\n\nA New York City man who was charged with two counts of first-degree murder this week has pleaded guilty to lesser charges for each murder, according to court records released Friday.\n\nAnthony Anthony Mello, 32, reportedly asked a New York City detective during the investigation what his chances were of getting out of the charges without trial, a document filed in the case shows. Mello, who will be sentenced on Nov. 13, was not eligible for bail after pleading guilty, so his sentencing hearing for each of the two charges will be held separately.\n\nSgt. Andrew Coluccio of the New York City Police Department told NBC New York that Mello was born in Brooklyn but raised in the Bronx, adding that the defendant's parents divorced when he was two years old.\n\nA jury will begin deliberating Mello's fate Friday morning, Coluccio said. He added that the case's prosecution had taken over a year and required a massive amount of resources. Mello's sister, Tanisha, told WPIX-TV that Mello had undergone multiple surgeries during the investigation, including skin grafts and bone grafts, and was on pain and anti-inflammatory medications.\n\nMello and his alleged victims, all in their 20s, were stabbed to death during a March 12, 2012, stabbing attack that authorities said started over a parking spot dispute. Prosecutors said Mello was the killer during the investigation. His accomplices, meanwhile, remain at large.","token_len":421,"entropy":[14.61,9.8779,8.4639,6.8517,8.2962,0.9644,3.7319,3.4998,0.0994,3.5115,5.3843,1.2293,1.4362,0.211,1.4353,3.1424,8.5351,2.294,8.2563,1.5967,3.2667,0.1439,0.6497,0.504,0.4045,0.0112,3.5978,7.9888,0.1408,12.57,1.8937,0.0017,1.3192,1.8251,3.8669,5.0625,0.9965,1.5815,0.3849,4.1258,0.1762,0.5104,0.0219,2.0808,0.9591,5.7077,2.8747,0.1184,1.5332,3.043,0.0979,0.0613,1.8374,5.3573,0.5256,1.3991,0.0012,1.3749,4.4506,3.9005,4.2586,0.6958,2.9203,0.7279,4.1756,0.4323,4.6125,1.745,0.5327,0.3176,1.6439,4.6415,0.6597,5.4011,0.8214,4.9069,2.9333,1.6308,1.0488,3.2846,2.0751,0.3585,0.6402,0.4887,3.1364,0.2596,4.6456,2.4278,0.0116,3.7102,1.5824,2.6237,0.0376,0.0047,6.1331,0.0089,6.9748,1.1289,4.1158,4.6934,1.7031,2.2694,0.5358,0.6228,0.0324,2.4696,1.2096,4.2788,1.1732,2.6608,1.186,2.2269,2.6288,1.7738,0.4268,0.04,0.3641,2.4026,0.0382,4.1314,5.361,0.9005,2.7581,3.331,1.5975,1.6654,3.4637,0.3609,5.3283,0.3759,0.0137,2.225,0.2034,0.0173,0.3632,5.5648,0.7237,2.183,1.8556,0.5636,0.2524,2.0998,0.2273,4.6542,4.3775,1.6817,1.4792,1.5249,0.0044,1.9651,0.962,2.9763,1.8278,0.2086,0.4476,0.0003,4.3005,5.5416,4.7414,4.1286,0.2395,3.1526,0.0122,6.6228,5.1191,1.5969,3.9643,0.1237,0.596,2.128,3.566,2.4602,1.379,4.149,3.391,1.8567,0.598,0.1131,1.8483,2.0292,0.0497,1.0137,2.3875,4.4796,5.077,1.2382,3.9915,4.9876,0.8354,0.494,2.5044,1.2367,1.7301,0.0177,2.8126,0.0004,2.2668,0.5132,5.3109,0.3394,0.0652,1.2801,3.1097,0.0119,3.3008,0.1039,2.2438,4.2645,4.8062,0.1187,0.894,3.4278,1.6425,0.0975,2.9377,4.1427,2.3025,2.8471,2.2025,5.0982,1.0047,1.7431,0.0651,0.9177,2.0615,1.1886,0.6089,0.404,1.534,0.3277,0.186,0.0003,6.4585,2.8922,0.0023,4.3029,3.6053,4.6344,0.474,1.6431,0.0296,0.8095,0.0102,0.509,0.0975,0.0128,1.9847,1.3133,1.6406,0.007,0.7038,0.7011,0.0002,1.8801,6.1087,0.1868,3.1466,1.6397,3.0534,0.1028,2.1563,0.2748,2.1731,5.6381,0.2001,1.6845,3.2711,2.2193,2.3231,3.7658,0.3078,0.1461,0.0023,4.777,0.5574,0.0021,0.2779,0.5828,0.0003,3.9621,4.8008,3.207,2.4739,0.7989,0.005,1.3231,0.0004,0.0086,0.6482,3.8748,1.5092,1.2933,2.479,0.0045,0.0004,0.1202,0.1386,2.7757,1.608,0.0793,1.4454,2.5169,5.1861,3.3475,3.035,2.742,3.993,2.4664,0.1083,1.7315,4.9615,1.7119,4.0022,0.7015,0.0012,1.3978,0.8286,3.2656,0.0004,1.492,6.2663,0.9533,4.4487,3.3548,0.2743,1.7448,1.2334,6.0668,0.0059,0.5097,0.0082,0.5997,2.4776,0.0005,1.9466,6.1154,3.7142,0.852,4.1117,0.385,0.5749,1.7297,1.6516,4.8597,0.0161,0.1411,1.4173,4.3555,1.603,0.0389,1.8369,0.7945,1.9926,3.3347,2.6439,3.9887,1.9543,0.0033,1.4003,1.0993,0.281,0.2384,0.0002,1.1849,0.0025,3.3521,1.0061,3.2032,2.2003,1.6259,3.3988,4.2511,0.0106,0.657,0.0165,0.2218,0.4603,2.8448,0.6472,0.0015,3.3643,0.7426,4.9323,2.9937,0.8303,0.2988,0.332,3.9789,2.8,3.0987,3.5524,0.9416,3.6197,2.7264,0.4636,2.3865,0.9749,3.3894,0.5179,3.3824,0.5667,0.7388,0.0001,2.2585,1.9799,3.8212,5.2387,0.9286,3.7356,1.273,4.2446,3.7666,1.9969,0.7662,5.114,0.0027,2.3373,0.1813,0.0229,0.1247]}
{"id":671,"ended":true,"length":372,"gen_text":"Mating in the tawny nurse shark is known to occur from July to August off Madagascar. Adult females have one functional ovary and two functional uteruses. The mode of reproduction is aplacental viviparity, where oocytes fertilize the egg in the fallopian tube. The fertilized egg hatches in spring. Ovary and uterus of the female are maintained for short periods in the male, as part of the courtship rituals. The female lays her eggs offshore during winter and fertilizes them and attaches the placenta using a fertilized egg. Eggs are typically deposited at depths of 5-20 meters.\n\nA female tawny nurse shark mating with two males in April of 2011 off the coast of Madagascar\n\nIt's thought that these sharks are most active with spawning season. The male feeds his sperm to the female by attaching a long \"jelly ball\" attached to the female with his pelvic fins. These sperm are deposited in large tubular sacs inside of the female and are carried offshore during spawning. It's hypothesized that the presence of these sperm helps to stimulate egg growth so some of the fertilized eggs are able to attach to the uteruses.\n\nThis is a close up photograph of some female tawny nurse sharks. These are 2 juveniles that have just spawned. They are laying their eggs in these large tubular sacs. The female will usually lay an occasional egg so there are plenty of fertilized eggs to be found.\n\nThere are a lot of hypotheses as to why this species of shark is so elusive in the wild. For example, as they are rare in the open ocean, it is possible to miss them at certain areas. It's also possible that tawny nurses give up their reproductive strategy by giving up on becoming reproductively successful. It's also possible that they simply disappear into the deep sea as their habitats are being consumed by other fish and shellfish species such as grouper. All we can do is make sure that those with eyes and a will to survive continue to explore our oceans.","token_len":422,"entropy":[8.2017,4.0097,1.1627,9.3523,4.3577,0.0025,12.0923,3.4872,2.6721,5.0379,0.3131,1.736,3.6859,3.3624,0.3738,1.9582,6.7052,7.905,0.9991,5.8237,1.4156,3.4179,5.4137,8.819,1.951,1.1661,1.3321,2.7429,2.1254,3.8186,2.2296,1.0774,1.6433,10.8454,0.0209,2.0369,0.52,3.2339,8.2743,0.3105,0.0022,1.1059,0.0339,0.0038,0.0051,1.3047,2.183,5.23,1.0676,1.8867,0.3817,1.4783,1.789,2.1596,0.2833,4.2497,0.0151,0.1572,0.7626,1.47,1.8709,0.0973,0.3194,2.9073,0.0,1.0728,4.254,2.0377,6.1373,1.8454,1.808,1.2427,2.487,0.7569,1.1468,1.1081,5.5138,3.3512,5.7282,0.1176,2.3669,0.8858,5.6085,1.9517,3.8126,3.5715,0.0025,1.1172,1.1215,0.0002,3.2833,0.4214,1.7225,1.5211,3.3871,2.3083,0.2051,6.1109,3.5133,4.6255,1.7322,4.716,0.6691,0.1416,6.1405,4.2472,1.9041,4.2597,0.0126,0.1993,7.0491,1.5017,4.6824,0.6952,0.0976,2.2774,4.0064,0.9938,4.4838,2.1494,2.6121,1.3153,0.3603,3.4561,1.2329,2.2025,1.3419,1.0821,1.8376,0.005,3.9639,2.1238,2.2578,0.0014,0.0004,0.0033,0.014,4.3498,1.6425,4.7531,1.7861,2.2341,5.562,2.8464,2.8073,1.6532,1.0891,0.8584,0.0065,0.9537,3.2848,0.0002,5.2371,2.547,2.8731,0.1878,3.9961,0.2857,1.9161,4.5858,1.8101,6.5919,5.6177,2.0311,2.5429,2.3513,3.1868,3.5496,4.8091,0.6205,0.406,0.205,0.2455,4.2108,3.6803,1.9525,4.4399,4.5757,4.4742,0.6484,3.8313,0.0839,4.1595,0.0935,0.9951,2.0696,4.3284,1.3259,3.496,0.7812,0.2624,4.4686,1.9239,1.3715,3.4692,0.9878,4.9131,6.2794,0.4321,2.0131,0.0309,4.0171,2.6751,0.226,0.2906,3.099,2.1451,2.3601,5.9285,2.6174,1.6383,1.3473,3.956,0.814,4.1338,0.0316,0.9603,4.6353,0.0256,1.8076,0.6963,3.204,1.4457,3.3851,2.3096,3.3911,6.2274,8.0451,1.1712,0.2895,2.4332,0.0359,0.0871,1.4077,2.1395,0.003,3.1223,0.3748,0.2789,3.0629,1.8913,1.523,1.4668,0.0002,3.7918,1.8772,1.1501,2.6138,0.667,4.3089,0.0536,6.0803,2.9587,0.5764,0.0012,0.0026,0.0354,0.1356,2.79,2.9573,1.9547,5.4079,4.9742,1.9419,2.4667,1.6315,3.3588,0.7687,2.2679,0.6956,5.3875,1.3122,0.0983,1.5968,4.3835,1.7929,0.4454,0.0157,0.0677,0.0124,0.8529,2.0732,2.1422,3.742,3.7997,1.2528,3.8758,8.1922,0.7954,5.154,3.0211,1.0458,2.9963,0.2208,3.758,0.0311,0.0236,1.1442,2.3993,0.5962,0.8275,0.8093,0.0002,4.5183,0.4697,2.3955,2.683,0.0473,5.5646,1.4073,0.0046,0.536,1.9256,1.0107,1.8241,0.2344,1.2085,0.97,3.8742,3.1364,0.3639,1.0998,0.2417,3.7888,1.4279,0.105,5.3713,3.486,0.9642,5.4207,1.226,0.4568,2.5297,0.1829,0.4521,1.554,1.3937,2.139,4.1439,2.6657,0.4863,4.1941,2.8767,4.2973,1.1663,2.2974,0.9307,0.2938,0.5468,0.1419,3.6807,0.002,0.006,3.3252,5.8989,2.5342,0.9397,3.3065,3.6003,4.5759,4.6208,0.5121,1.7827,5.3421,4.1393,0.0084,0.0325,2.0694,1.0381,2.2721,0.5052,0.698,0.4439,0.0749,1.6392,3.0487,4.1804,2.7452,0.0982,1.0765,1.9383,3.3137,2.7999,3.7084,1.2051,3.2247,4.4969,0.2541,0.921,2.7626,1.3576,4.7675,0.0313,3.1491,5.4889,0.0044,4.4273,0.0,1.0274,6.1644,3.1028,1.0275,0.3918,0.2437,4.1001,1.2128,0.7248,6.0216,4.478,4.0479,2.254,1.9082,4.6062,0.2472,3.8608,2.1059,0.2137,3.27,3.2276,0.5123,1.8971]}

{"id":1954,"ended":false,"length":378,"gen_text":"The internal structures of the crest of Corythosaurus are quite complex, making possible a call that could be used for warning or attracting a mate. Nasal passageways of Corythosaurus, as well as the opening in the middle are reminiscent of similar structures in the mouthparts of other birds like penguins. In this case, Nasal passageways are likely for feeding, as they probably play a part in the digestion of food.\n\n\"With this bird being related to penguins and its nasal passages are quite similar to penguin nostrils and they have teeth similar to human teeth, it could be a good candidate for finding some Neanderthal DNA in our DNA. But it's more likely to be related to other animals because there were a lot more penguins over our time than there are human beings. If you use this as evidence of Neanderthal ancestry, more than 80% of the population in the US live in this area, so they have a lot of descendants there.\"\n\nThe new species can be identified with the help of an app using facial features, DNA, and 3D scans.\n\n\"This bird has a good chance of being a species that wasn't really on the radar for many years because it was a very rare bird. But with the introduction of smartphones you can now identify a living animal using just a little bit of facial information. The app will tell you the approximate age, sex, and other traits, and if you want more information the app will provide that as well. There's a lot of work to be done in order to fully integrate that information as effectively as possible into the overall system.

He was part of the Leeds team that won promotion to the First Division and scored the only goal of the Championship play-offs in 2008.\n\nCrosby scored 31 goals for Leeds United in 85 starts, and has been capped 19 times. He is currently enjoying his most prolific campaign to date with nine goals in 15 appearances for Great Britain during Euro 2012 qualifying. A \u00a310.8 million deal was negotiated by Rangers with Leeds United in 2010.\n\nCrosby returned to Sheffield United for pre-season training in February 2010 but his transfer to Rangers was not completed until after the end of that season, meaning that he was not eligible to play for the Scottish champions until his 20th birthday.\n\nWhile he may be the most prolific scorer of goals for the Red Army, not many have matched his scoring record from a shot on target in Premier League matches. From January 1998 to June 2006, the striker recorded 29 goals in 50 matches, which is currently a club record. He had 13 goals in 23 matches during the 2007-08 season, when he netted twice in his opening game against Newcastle.\n\nRANGERS' OFF-SEASON DEALS\n\n\u00a33.4M - Steven Naismith to Newcastle United\n\n$2.8M - Rob Kiernan to Brighton & Hove Albion\n\nFree Transfer - Lewis Macleod to Wolverhampton Wanderers\n\n$2.8M - David Davis to Newcastle United\n\n$2M - Steven Naismith to Sunderland\n\n\u00a32.75M - Chris Sutton to Everton\n\n* Transfer fee was reduced during the transfer window (January 2012)\n\nFollow @WestHamUnited","token_len":424,"entropy":[7.8507,1.7462,3.3963,7.7739,1.0637,8.1456,2.5114,2.5464,0.4234,2.8474,1.142,2.7412,16.9563,9.8487,7.4715,10.5696,1.7954,3.7138,5.626,3.991,5.2358,2.7859,1.1949,0.3776,0.3278,0.2622,7.7294,8.6114,4.5653,3.9826,7.3707,2.0655,3.1205,4.3593,12.0606,3.0044,1.0251,1.2851,5.2572,5.0721,5.4812,4.9118,1.3948,6.2478,2.6036,0.3237,0.0738,4.2923,5.0064,2.3586,0.5246,1.1614,0.0364,2.6278,5.5544,4.7804,4.1007,2.1513,5.5437,0.7696,0.1723,4.4265,3.4344,0.649,0.9426,2.6199,3.1999,4.5579,5.4892,1.7928,4.3832,0.0173,0.9677,3.5846,1.9362,1.3986,0.4034,1.4138,3.025,0.4361,0.5073,1.932,1.8259,3.8427,0.0046,0.4589,0.7786,1.5983,0.5598,0.6806,1.0438,0.4103,0.0388,3.7839,0.0283,2.8942,2.9761,2.1161,2.3889,0.051,2.0868,0.2682,2.3498,0.3584,0.1512,1.5527,1.6456,4.0035,0.678,0.3751,0.0003,1.4428,8.8296,0.4478,3.176,4.4839,0.1836,2.1681,0.5385,2.3781,0.8284,5.2489,3.5202,1.8678,2.1431,4.3592,2.613,1.4476,4.3403,0.0024,2.2942,0.9973,3.2452,2.2624,4.5156,1.6778,3.3638,0.8084,2.9194,1.2839,0.0039,1.7677,4.592,0.072,0.2598,2.9145,1.3769,0.9538,6.1218,0.0003,3.787,2.3087,0.471,2.2166,0.3564,6.3872,5.496,2.5821,1.8548,2.7496,0.2267,2.9498,0.858,4.3455,1.9839,4.9183,3.453,1.5682,1.1849,1.3161,3.553,1.2113,0.3714,0.0003,1.8122,0.1349,0.0005,5.5052,0.0636,5.0514,0.1652,2.073,2.3989,0.0432,0.0087,0.2114,1.1994,3.475,2.2675,2.6823,3.4366,4.8665,1.0466,0.7146,0.6935,1.5739,0.4704,0.0776,3.5828,0.4628,2.2696,0.007,2.424,1.0315,2.5894,4.0482,1.6069,0.6928,1.5664,1.3039,1.045,0.4585,0.3126,0.5856,0.6595,5.6817,1.6227,0.6694,3.6971,4.1195,0.0379,0.0652,0.2942,0.5516,0.0002,5.8209,1.9198,4.0511,2.0823,2.6832,1.4204,2.7702,1.9179,1.7656,1.1446,1.251,1.7011,2.2814,0.0176,0.579,6.6144,1.523,3.4388,3.6131,0.4062,4.3839,0.6709,4.3383,2.0049,4.9724,0.9021,0.3268,2.5956,5.2054,0.0096,1.5572,0.3175,5.8708,3.6792,4.7302,0.2649,2.5696,2.9649,0.345,2.5951,2.6642,4.7483,4.3478,0.4052,0.9044,4.5007,1.6764,1.5295,2.8006,1.1684,5.2535,2.6975,1.7683,0.0275,0.5259,2.4198,4.5026,5.4285,0.5667,0.1933,4.0632,1.0171,1.8316,0.5106,1.4553,1.0775,0.1991,0.3513,1.1633,3.0915,0.3253,3.4072,3.8376,0.4894,2.4464,2.9704,2.0931,1.7474,2.6097,2.2465,0.3949,0.0003,4.1988,3.8221,0.022,2.9447,4.7108,2.8675,0.9836,0.0015,3.2752,0.5358,0.5992,0.0002,3.8532,2.5233,0.2881,3.0754,3.5506,1.4802,4.5598,0.9962,0.0,0.0,1.9306,2.6782,0.4476,0.8035,0.0002,3.7828,2.5137,0.2248,2.4322,0.0745,0.0365,5.2446,0.2958,0.012,0.0411,4.6412,0.7156,0.0036,0.0001,0.0002,0.0944,0.0003,6.4804,1.4482,0.5999,5.083,0.9706,0.0248,0.0065,0.0598,5.1039,0.0001,0.0001,0.0062,0.0049,0.1281,0.0002,1.5664,1.6117,0.3544,1.7573,0.0416,0.0469,3.5872,4.9412,0.0363,3.9961,0.0409,0.0692,0.0002,0.7879,1.1072,1.8662,0.0575,3.6805,1.1387,0.0001,0.0003,0.0339,3.571,0.0957,0.0002,1.6714,1.4419,0.7918,4.3397,0.0303,0.0434,3.8946,1.5625,0.0257,4.2818,0.0938,0.0002,6.5156,5.0345,0.9708,3.5071,3.3455,6.0387,0.5038,2.6623,0.0497,4.732,3.6158,2.2083,0.3798,0.5567,0.0002,3.2391,0.5168,4.2733,0.1721,1.025]}
{"id":385,"ended":true,"length":392,"gen_text":"Though Wilde deployed characters that were by now familiar \u2014 the dandy lord, the overbearing matriarch, the woman with a past, the puritan young lady \u2014 his treatment is subtler than in previous novels about the aristocracy in the 19th century. But these characters are all men; none is a woman. In the novel's first half, the novel moves back to the West Country, a period of decline into which Wilde took part.\n\nIn 1870, Wilde fell victim to his own vices when he tried to seduce a woman named Mary Agnes Brown, a former prostitute whom he met while travelling in Australia. The affair ended violently, and she left him for another man. In the following years he met many women but had only one lasting relationship: with a woman named Lady Chatterley, who is more or less the same age as Wilde. Despite being in another relationship, they keep in touch through letters.\n\nThis is a rare moment in the novel, when the woman Wilde romances becomes an antagonist, rather than someone he shares an attraction to. It adds weight to some of the other female characters, who make more of an impression in this section of the book, such as Lady Agnes's secretary, Mrs. Sotherton, and Lady Chatterley's husband, whom Lady Agnes discovers to be her father's lover. The novel goes so far as to explore whether there is any love between Lady Chatterley and Lady Agnes, an answer that could complicate the relationship between Chatterley and Lady Agnes in subsequent chapters.\n\nWilde's characters are more human than in prior books, and one thinks of them as flawed human beings, rather than mere caricatures. The novel, then, can be a rather light read for those seeking their moral truths. I certainly appreciated Wilde at my age; I found the novel very readable, though I didn't have many literary references (as in any of the others in this series ), so that part of the pleasure could have been lost on me. I still appreciated it for the historical events it documented.","token_len":425,"entropy":[13.2764,11.6167,9.35,3.2131,1.3239,7.1172,2.0955,1.8009,4.9835,1.7301,4.3582,1.5408,8.9796,1.126,0.1041,6.6652,1.4744,3.5876,0.747,0.003,0.5414,0.1172,5.1926,2.7788,1.4524,5.3192,2.7097,0.3549,8.497,0.1316,7.7315,2.7185,0.6624,2.6421,4.5346,7.9903,7.5207,0.001,1.1985,2.9236,3.66,1.6578,3.7416,1.1575,3.6069,4.0185,1.6681,2.2303,0.0015,0.0766,0.2281,4.3505,5.1722,1.847,1.0891,3.7362,5.2497,3.2978,5.23,2.2301,0.7164,0.0861,0.3074,3.022,1.7926,1.4886,0.6526,2.4569,1.7714,0.0804,1.604,2.2522,3.7019,2.8305,2.4991,0.7525,5.4068,1.195,0.8255,3.4194,3.2759,1.2234,3.2829,5.8665,0.8291,1.656,5.4217,5.3008,0.9208,3.193,0.0007,2.3178,6.443,0.1435,2.3051,6.0086,5.4372,0.018,2.6119,0.7483,5.1829,0.0136,3.6653,0.3175,4.2256,0.1387,2.0623,0.0005,1.0222,2.4239,1.5308,3.1533,5.8264,0.0409,4.5433,1.5029,1.9331,3.2443,3.3114,3.3443,0.1101,1.5918,2.36,5.3333,0.8915,4.6346,0.2361,1.9193,2.0044,1.0668,4.6197,0.983,0.9414,3.5158,1.7646,0.229,1.5714,0.859,0.2175,0.4308,2.6339,1.5208,3.3182,0.7475,3.1363,5.2896,3.0681,1.0835,3.9159,3.9846,3.0469,0.8589,1.6409,0.28,1.8355,0.4445,2.1468,1.5601,0.2958,4.0985,4.0321,0.0096,0.0544,1.1551,1.3201,4.3732,5.3251,1.7785,0.0004,1.2334,1.8995,0.3535,0.0902,2.3513,1.2362,5.9366,3.4503,2.3936,7.6785,1.2858,0.5291,2.7376,5.9607,0.3682,0.218,2.9406,0.1649,1.1112,1.0199,0.0002,4.5181,1.596,1.7868,5.0938,3.2724,0.6068,0.9665,1.1058,1.5742,1.4302,1.2312,3.8039,1.7457,4.5497,0.7024,3.3646,2.9286,4.0046,1.8958,2.1672,0.0049,4.4951,1.003,5.0059,1.8332,3.6439,1.9439,0.1726,2.8399,5.8651,4.3212,0.0629,5.3994,0.1743,0.398,2.9191,5.3556,0.101,1.1011,1.2245,5.6761,4.2111,0.9129,0.4345,1.3857,1.8176,1.8758,2.6391,0.9747,0.0218,1.6971,1.9102,2.3826,0.0018,1.1445,2.6622,0.045,1.9924,4.7372,0.5244,2.4265,0.3676,5.3599,4.6015,0.8448,0.605,1.4608,1.4392,0.4038,0.0015,0.004,0.0712,4.1747,0.157,5.2788,2.3415,1.7615,0.0007,5.0348,1.9218,0.1223,3.2905,1.8782,4.0077,2.3798,0.1946,2.7846,1.7571,5.3134,4.3803,0.0335,0.0796,0.0134,5.3446,3.0776,4.1738,1.0446,1.8513,4.3965,0.5186,1.3227,0.344,0.0012,0.0027,0.0837,1.1945,0.2141,0.0007,0.9311,3.9033,5.6758,0.9144,3.6453,5.9891,0.9081,1.9948,0.2338,3.5272,0.0042,0.0074,0.0968,1.3154,0.2164,0.0009,2.9627,3.7127,2.5976,0.0816,0.3034,0.0002,2.8174,0.0004,1.1039,3.9142,1.1207,3.4556,4.3714,0.7948,1.5629,6.4765,2.066,1.3782,1.2242,5.1737,6.0268,0.5679,1.6283,0.5149,4.7078,2.4338,0.0048,1.6347,1.2965,0.0045,3.7044,2.121,0.0015,0.5596,2.2922,1.5562,4.0037,4.4907,0.0057,4.0829,0.6233,3.5307,4.6986,5.4338,0.9921,2.4124,0.9589,4.0552,6.1633,3.6153,5.5429,1.1629,5.6798,4.688,4.061,2.8861,6.4693,4.6619,1.8898,3.2859,1.1507,3.2316,1.5401,1.6115,3.8247,2.253,1.0421,2.6228,1.2847,3.146,0.0003,3.6443,3.5096,4.9773,1.9644,4.6482,3.5977,3.7158,4.7913,1.5693,1.1686,3.9192,1.8249,0.6984,0.9019,10.604,2.2008,4.1097,3.1752,0.6751,0.5496,1.6535,4.9268,1.0458,0.3436,0.9305,0.3046,0.0703,0.0643,2.7784,4.0452,4.8612,2.3442,2.7477,1.319,5.0156,4.7477,1.0676,4.0656,1.6976]}
{"id":4744,"ended":true,"length":371,"gen_text":"Limited running in practice and a wet qualifying session meant that teams had to improvise their strategies at the Hockenheimring. Fernando Alonso controlled much of the race from pole position, only relinquishing the lead after three laps when he encountered mechanical problems.\n\nAfter the race Ferrari was left in a strong position to qualify second on the grid and to make the final-eight in the driver's championship. Hamilton could not hold on to that position after his puncture during qualifying and he was overtaken by Alonso during the early laps in the race.\n\nA poor start to the race and a spin for Hamilton in the final stages saw him drop to 10th place.

{"id":4674,"ended":true,"length":380,"gen_text":"When Brady Hoke took over as Michigan head coach for the 2011 NCAA Division I FBS football season, Kovacs impressed him quickly. Kovacs was one of the first five players named as a finalist for the Biletnikoff Award as the nation's top wide receiver, and he did not play in the second half against Michigan State.\n\nWhile Kovacs' production at Michigan didn't go as expected under Hoke, he proved that he was more than ready to step in and be the star.\n\nHe played a lead role in four of the Wolverines' five wins, but he also made two starts, one being against Florida. On two of those three Michigan wins, the Wolverines trailed for 80 or more yards at one point, but Kovacs stepped up twice, catching a touchdown for one of those occasions.\n\nThen, on the game-winning touchdown drive in Tallahassee with the score 49-49, Kovacs had the largest catch of the season, surpassing Mike Dudek, and that's a trend we'll likely see a lot more of in his sophomore season.\n\nWhile he may not have had a ton of catches and yards, Kovacs' game on Saturday was a prime example of what type of player he showed potential to become. He made a ton of plays, one after the other, and finished the season with 61 receptions for 875 yards and 12 touchdowns.\n\nThat's just an incredible production for an individual who had never played college football before.\n\nKovacs averaged 16.6 yards per reception as a true sophomore, which is a decent stat, but Kovacs will only become a better player in 2017. If he keeps up his production, then he could very well end up becoming a first-round NFL draft pick by 2017.\n\nThere's a reason why the Patriots drafted him in the third round of the 2017 NFL Draft, and he's still just 19 years old. He's still so young, and there will surely be a lot of growth in him before then.\n\nYou can follow Timothy Rapp on Twitter.","token_len":428,"entropy":[10.4201,4.7627,0.0081,3.7667,0.1297,1.2447,1.0345,2.5289,0.0751,4.9968,0.359,2.1744,10.908,2.1919,0.244,3.635,0.5997,2.7387,0.0847,0.0731,16.1753,0.6248,8.9132,2.2096,6.1117,0.4908,2.7877,0.0014,1.585,3.206,0.011,0.6044,2.6183,3.7545,0.8313,4.4577,2.7093,0.7756,3.896,0.0184,0.0702,0.1558,4.2304,0.0347,0.0,0.0012,0.0414,3.2793,0.5154,0.1778,0.0014,0.2152,1.7057,0.0187,1.4688,0.9531,0.9602,5.523,0.8299,5.5036,1.6091,0.7208,5.348,0.8021,3.8282,2.9856,0.2452,0.9881,0.9523,0.0003,5.1029,1.7273,0.0013,2.6687,2.9008,3.521,0.3123,3.2786,0.0003,4.0718,0.7133,1.6788,5.1816,0.6175,0.0009,0.1682,1.0503,4.5488,2.4048,0.2409,1.4698,2.5945,0.026,3.4667,0.6578,2.2825,1.2348,0.5096,2.163,1.43,4.3074,4.906,1.2289,0.0002,3.0942,3.5435,3.5054,6.5861,0.0995,0.2796,5.1382,1.1717,0.7062,0.1803,0.0003,0.1015,1.4336,1.0655,1.6726,5.0704,1.7447,1.8084,3.3013,3.262,2.755,1.9051,3.4687,6.8606,1.2552,4.1166,1.4436,4.5517,4.4981,1.1616,0.4945,2.6601,4.1002,0.4272,0.1117,3.8066,0.6279,0.0004,2.9901,2.8904,7.0697,1.4412,0.0458,0.6499,3.7961,1.238,0.0569,1.526,2.1561,0.1852,0.0017,4.1505,0.1905,7.5768,2.0085,1.3655,2.206,1.5951,5.3096,3.9082,1.0211,1.416,5.3512,0.7319,0.3495,0.0002,5.8251,0.806,1.8502,1.2246,3.6431,1.2398,0.0849,2.1172,2.0845,1.823,7.8433,0.0023,0.0056,0.0002,5.0925,2.0144,2.8057,6.1035,0.0187,1.3754,0.3271,0.3015,0.0025,2.6461,2.7522,5.9251,0.8892,0.2835,2.2603,0.9569,1.3233,4.6806,0.0008,5.1836,5.7392,0.0067,3.1268,2.5836,3.8784,2.2366,3.0481,5.3276,3.5678,1.2063,3.5672,0.2703,3.8658,0.1166,0.6767,0.0851,1.4018,3.1706,2.395,0.3915,0.2384,0.1817,0.0002,3.6693,1.8494,2.4616,0.4521,1.0318,2.0706,1.8712,4.3035,0.0296,2.6348,3.9593,1.0883,0.8797,0.719,0.0042,2.9201,4.5474,4.1232,1.1297,1.3944,1.7022,4.5408,0.0348,0.1118,1.4167,5.2036,0.0022,0.5488,0.1457,8.6222,4.3944,0.1211,1.7222,0.6007,1.7859,2.935,1.667,3.6563,0.001,0.701,1.1573,5.7607,3.3383,0.8149,0.168,0.2642,0.4866,5.3052,1.1427,3.3502,0.3302,5.0472,1.0689,0.2372,1.8096,4.5499,0.0231,0.1725,3.5933,0.0559,0.2306,0.2912,0.0002,3.9241,0.6637,3.7016,3.4391,3.1374,3.2338,1.2706,3.1869,2.5557,1.6807,2.8748,2.5525,1.0501,2.8525,0.027,0.5703,1.1663,0.7635,0.0002,2.3522,0.0038,0.0142,5.625,2.5723,0.1781,2.3578,0.0189,0.0507,1.0844,4.9591,0.0893,2.6284,3.2794,0.4893,1.8274,1.3003,2.1096,5.1979,4.7483,1.7289,0.1713,4.848,0.0033,3.6473,4.5354,3.6984,1.5057,0.5901,0.4065,2.4842,4.2749,0.7154,4.3778,0.5303,3.3932,1.2856,0.889,1.3248,1.1541,3.8308,0.633,1.2892,2.8544,0.0971,2.9102,0.0763,3.3556,1.0418,1.1666,0.2706,0.0534,1.7227,0.7156,0.0875,4.6046,3.198,0.22,0.2563,0.0002,4.3093,0.919,1.6618,2.0266,0.7154,2.5357,3.1087,1.7931,0.4344,0.7137,0.0561,1.5313,0.0237,0.8596,0.1336,2.1472,0.131,0.2556,1.1423,0.246,2.7155,1.4867,3.8181,1.7871,1.8348,0.1446,0.046,0.1357,2.352,0.9294,2.1859,5.4788,0.3151,0.6859,0.3809,3.0577,3.6273,4.6927,0.0444,1.4433,0.3834,0.7134,1.9736,2.1723,2.2338,3.6239,3.2294,0.2806,0.3142,0.0002,5.1217,0.648,1.0213,1.9821,0.0099,0.0004,0.0019,0.0059]}

The prelude chapters are actually set after the game's story with two endings, with one ending depending on if you've completed the Prequel Missions. There are nine chapters, with four of the prequel chapters being downloadable or included in the main story's DLC, making a total of four separate chapters in the game.\n\n\"For us, it can't be any different from what we're doing with 'God of War, Dark Souls, Uncharted 4' and the like, where we have so many different versions for so many different platforms,\" Yves Guillemot said of the DLC. \"That's not to say that PS4 and Xbox One are going to be the only versions of this game, but we're going to have one version. When we do, which will be before the game comes out, then I will do a PS4 and Xbox One edition, then release both at the same time on the same day of release.\"\n\nIn short, Sony is planning two versions of Infamous: Second Son. There are two DLC packs for it, and Sony is planning to make the games available for both the PS4 and Xbox One.\n\nThat means you're going to be able to experience Infamous: Second Son on PS4 and Xbox One, as well as PC, as a single game with the same version.

At first he is traumatized by the ordeal, but he soon grows fond of Lois, and the way she plays him on the show.\n\nSeason Eight:\n\nIn ''I'm a Cheerleader,'' the boys discover that Lois' father, a cop, has hired her to find out why the football team was losing. In the episode, Stewie confronts Lois over her father's demands and demands that he have dinner together with her and her cousin. Lois is so upset that she drops him off at the bus stop so that he will drive up and pick her up; he never came home for dinner. Stewie decides to track down Lois's father's location, which is revealed to be on TV's \"The Price Is Right\". Although the group is skeptical, they agree to use her father's card to beat the odds together. He wins and Lois ends up losing. As part of their deal, however, the group agrees to give her a present.\n\nAt the end of ''Bart Saves the World,'' the gang meets on a date for dinner at the new restaurant, The Cheesecake Factory. Stewie, who is very unhappy because he didn't get a present for the birthday party, says, ``I got a great present tonight.'' In the ending sequences of ''Lisa's First Word,'' the boys are celebrating at Lisa's home, when she answers the door at 6:30 am. They see that the house is full of presents -- a huge one, a small one and a couple of others -- and go downstairs to see who it is. Upon seeing Stewie, the gang is overjoyed. When their mother arrives, Lisa declares that they must eat his present, which is a very long-discarded shirt that says ``He is the life of any party.'' The gang refuses to eat the gift; for this they are punished by having Stewie sit out in the middle of the day and Stewie's parents walk around the house while they leave the door open.\n\nAppearances","token_len":437,"entropy":[8.1721,9.8123,7.5593,7.4017,0.0314,5.3698,7.4277,1.7972,2.6341,12.6793,13.4278,1.2723,5.724,3.5644,2.502,2.5133,6.478,7.963,3.2205,0.797,1.3749,5.1305,1.4978,1.5625,0.4356,4.3181,2.2914,2.4501,1.6812,8.8238,0.0469,0.8672,0.9324,5.1926,0.3523,0.2596,2.3872,1.3672,3.1223,2.8386,0.0166,2.4774,1.59,1.2561,2.7528,6.0544,0.5031,4.8806,4.2683,4.2808,0.4092,3.7222,0.6364,1.5734,0.042,3.9812,5.0267,2.9985,1.7078,0.0002,2.094,4.8396,4.3002,1.4791,1.2818,4.7586,0.1735,0.0073,2.8664,3.0613,3.3282,3.6812,0.7259,2.0757,3.4804,2.5321,1.7037,2.8606,5.1159,0.2193,1.2275,5.0454,4.0044,0.6762,4.2422,2.859,2.3656,1.862,4.6764,0.2497,3.1532,2.7401,0.9491,3.4196,1.0987,1.3109,0.3432,2.4119,0.0002,6.02,1.0491,2.861,1.0407,0.7972,0.1106,5.9889,2.0904,3.926,0.7639,2.0905,4.1844,4.3916,5.1031,1.2309,0.6089,1.9988,0.8761,5.8081,1.083,1.4821,2.5447,3.8395,1.7627,0.9775,0.2815,5.3658,4.0948,0.7365,0.3243,0.8964,2.3008,0.3955,4.3811,1.1887,0.4792,2.0664,4.5414,5.625,1.4713,1.2136,0.3894,0.0178,5.4764,1.893,4.675,6.3221,2.7608,4.5351,0.5462,0.3634,2.471,0.0001,3.5206,0.294,5.2492,0.483,1.666,2.5266,0.3218,3.6768,3.9476,1.5285,3.6118,1.9062,1.4701,0.1128,0.0433,3.4805,4.7749,3.7293,3.3008,2.0239,2.4978,0.7399,0.0011,2.2859,5.6928,2.1055,5.1916,1.5662,3.9725,1.197,0.9334,2.6118,0.0722,5.5902,3.9467,0.8135,0.2437,4.4753,0.5144,6.0668,0.4226,2.5852,7.6996,0.3754,4.9314,2.5597,2.5816,2.6024,4.9311,0.0355,4.1824,2.0951,4.9212,5.115,0.0021,2.2746,2.6815,0.1498,5.3414,0.0019,2.3658,1.0818,1.4096,0.1793,2.42,1.5631,1.4439,4.2387,2.0567,1.9433,0.0002,3.9726,0.4936,0.8658,0.0128,3.4744,3.7564,2.867,3.3981,3.0479,0.0551,0.1337,0.148,1.7969,1.7775,4.6163,5.0282,1.1687,3.4248,2.642,2.3534,1.554,1.3727,5.8321,1.0685,1.6229,2.8383,3.7534,0.2957,0.1123,0.0118,0.2794,1.7861,0.0001,2.4796,2.1418,1.233,4.1039,4.5938,3.4336,0.6795,3.5206,0.0007,0.6351,1.177,2.1259,1.9865,2.5336,2.4764,2.2758,0.4849,4.3495,2.8901,1.1892,1.1587,3.7217,1.4048,4.745,0.4136,3.735,1.8273,3.2362,0.6495,5.7946,7.5109,1.5907,1.5669,4.5033,1.4147,2.7095,0.0578,0.2045,1.6977,2.3023,1.894,3.9481,2.5603,2.9783,0.0328,4.589,1.3194,2.0965,2.9431,4.9995,0.2913,0.1327,5.406,2.9121,0.2402,1.1239,4.4774,0.9363,2.4483,4.2931,2.114,2.0527,2.5645,0.2879,3.4235,0.0136,4.7033,5.5951,2.5479,4.4172,2.8306,2.335,1.1252,1.9254,0.0849,1.9966,0.6371,3.1008,0.2221,3.1672,2.1029,0.4764,4.9953,3.9787,0.3189,2.1346,2.2226,2.3578,0.3059,0.2077,4.6079,1.4388,1.7253,0.0003,0.397,2.2605,2.9833,2.3558,2.7152,0.0019,0.0001,1.5121,3.5427,5.6362,1.8966,2.0968,0.6739,3.8237,5.2796,0.7843,2.4798,4.0213,4.018,5.9173,1.0013,1.4831,1.2213,0.6266,0.4941,5.3248,5.0016,4.0156,6.0969,0.4815,5.5292,2.1525,3.4501,0.3426,5.5919,3.6949,2.9323,5.6466,0.1068,4.3405,0.0584,0.2653,1.8793,1.4502,5.5398,0.6726,0.3859,1.6128,1.5578,4.1253,5.6841,3.6769,2.071,0.5295,1.4518,0.6497,1.5951,4.7948,0.0002,4.0267,3.9474,2.243,0.0664,3.9192,0.0167,0.0886,5.4998,1.9972,5.2481,0.0001,1.8836,3.3584,5.0068,2.7895,1.2415,0.4593,3.9363,2.3063,5.5078,1.3918,2.3948,0.2536,0.6383,1.0762,0.0002,5.7512]}
{"id":10,"ended":false,"length":388,"gen_text":"Barker was a devout Christian, and produced religious @ - @ themed works throughout her life. She published eight postcards and five guardian angel birthday cards for the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, and three for the Fellowship of Religious Educators of America (F.R.E.A.T.). In 1978, she was elected to the Order of the Christian Heraldry, the highest degree of the Order of Christian Knighthood, and began training for the degree. During her four decade of knighthood she was an ordained deacon, teacher, and teacher at the Christian Life University, and became the first woman to have been elected to the American College of Christian Education (ACPED). In 1984, she moved to California for her final years as a student with F.R.E.A.T., now known as Luth.\nCatherine Barker's final works were published by her beloved publisher E.A.R.T. Books in the early 1990s. She never lived to see her name on the masthead.\nTaken from Wikipedia\nCatherine Barker's Legacy:\nCatherine Barker's work may be seen through a spiritual lens as well. In her writings she reflects on a personal, not religious, view of life and death, but there were many other aspects of her work that might serve as a lens through which to examine the impact of the death of a loved one.\nIn a short autobiography, she expresses deep sadness over the loss of her husband, and the life he could have had. The memoir also describes a time that she feared that she would lose her own life. Her work has been instrumental in helping to educate and minister to families who have lost a loved one in the world and also the families of those who die. When their loved one died, Catherine Barker and her colleagues assisted people through Spiritual Re-entry programs which provide support and encouragement to those who are trying to go through the final stages before death. Barker is one of many Christian ministers who have participated in Spiritual Re-entry programs.

Many books of their writings are on the 'Great Tradition' and often include some of the great feminist and revolutionary writers of our time.\n\n\nOne of the best feminist writers of our time is Noam Chomsky, whose work has helped to provide the theoretical basis for our new era of free thought. There are a number of classic pieces by Chomsky on feminism and\/or social justice, with a focus on the role of women in society. One of the best is \"Power and Paranoia\". Although the book is written in 1980, many of the points are still relevant today, especially the idea that the struggle is never-ending. As part of our research, however, we have taken a look at the writings of his friends such as Judith Butler and Camille Paglia.\n\n\nWe have found that the writings of many of the greatest feminist writers of our time are often linked together by some sort of philosophical theme. Here are just some of these themes. 1. Gender: The Feminine (1972, with Diana Eck) 2. Gender Equality (1974, with Martha C Zernow) 3. Feminism: Theory and Practice (1982, with Elisabeth Kubler Ross) 4. Gender and Capitalism (1983, with Linda Woolf) 5. Gender and Revolution (1991, with Ruth Benedict) 6. Feminism: The Human Right and the Global Community (1992, with Camille Paglia)\n\nWe believe that there is a significant link between the philosophy of feminism and the study of history and that if we do not understand these links, we may be sadly mistaken about the role of feminism in history.\n\n\nIn the future, our work will investigate the relationship between feminism and science, religion, and philosophy.","token_len":438,"entropy":[8.752,1.0699,2.8748,6.39,0.5291,1.5273,2.475,3.7632,12.1634,0.4107,4.1229,9.4414,3.1368,0.1654,11.9239,0.2539,0.361,4.8537,0.0204,1.2651,10.0076,3.0419,0.0243,14.7998,9.2804,1.0998,2.5185,0.3361,3.4561,9.6169,2.8319,8.9834,4.1833,0.6249,7.9242,5.8475,8.7487,4.5287,11.1355,1.9847,0.0005,0.6405,7.6414,2.2399,3.3254,4.7391,0.1875,4.0501,0.2661,1.2885,5.8929,5.4077,1.3773,0.5651,4.1344,0.1763,4.9495,0.0019,5.1932,5.0285,2.476,2.5327,1.5727,2.9688,2.2379,5.3548,4.817,0.0206,3.0846,4.5062,0.3851,0.5805,5.9508,4.0008,1.3383,5.8174,2.3279,2.8117,1.9841,3.8201,4.4646,0.0127,5.6005,2.2352,2.6169,0.6994,3.6661,4.4676,2.8922,1.8464,2.1348,1.5658,4.681,0.9638,5.7161,5.0986,4.9104,0.3433,2.4161,4.8603,3.4062,3.6604,1.129,0.3726,4.2947,3.7974,4.5663,4.4543,0.9401,0.6144,2.9808,0.5147,0.529,2.2194,0.0002,4.4013,0.3261,0.2717,2.4338,3.7202,0.8682,0.7585,1.4719,0.2093,0.6523,3.8692,0.2151,0.0084,1.342,2.6228,2.2611,1.6741,3.6811,1.0386,4.8199,1.8407,3.593,1.6866,0.2397,4.2476,5.7937,2.9781,0.5678,4.667,1.274,0.5193,5.2481,0.5172,2.9525,0.608,0.0027,5.3638,4.785,1.2174,1.5191,1.5668,3.3567,1.6703,5.6857,0.0101,3.4641,1.2294,1.2894,5.1491,2.2768,2.4487,0.0414,1.0559,2.877,0.1152,0.572,0.1928,1.566,0.5004,3.1047,0.3449,0.5872,0.8442,1.6991,2.8259,3.8726,0.1286,3.8406,0.3289,2.7167,5.4774,2.4696,1.898,0.9246,2.3234,0.5749,4.4387,0.1936,3.4085,0.245,0.2331,2.0919,1.5796,0.382,0.8864,0.422,1.8402,1.6499,1.4247,2.5119,0.5103,1.7859,5.0406,3.9688,3.9068,0.7614,0.0062,0.9433,5.434,5.6885,0.0024,3.0457,4.3276,1.3475,6.4267,0.0136,0.2071,1.5978,4.4266,1.0086,1.045,0.1141,1.6949,2.168,0.1091,5.3523,4.5939,4.2229,0.0037,4.6939,0.0505,1.1308,4.2391,0.021,0.0055,0.0003,0.7242,0.9864,0.0003,3.424,0.8922,3.1304,0.9793,1.9951,2.146,0.1603,3.2499,0.59,0.5145,3.4844,1.5013,0.7224,1.0538,0.4993,0.1719,1.2084,3.0128,4.7325,1.9301,2.9658,3.7208,3.6777,0.0017,4.3542,2.879,0.6075,4.0217,0.7642,2.3202,2.0607,0.4659,3.298,0.7367,1.5898,6.7442,0.3939,4.0905,2.8917,2.4057,3.3115,0.1748,3.1898,4.022,1.9154,0.2563,5.5923,3.1463,1.4165,1.6085,0.0047,3.6473,5.1807,0.5416,2.6923,0.3856,0.0265,5.2824,2.6669,6.6085,3.1782,0.7419,0.1115,0.0928,0.0028,2.6303,0.0634,1.8639,4.7292,0.29,0.2907,0.0256,3.7733,0.1277,0.0208,5.5806,0.3419,0.0126,3.7838,0.0034,3.3792,0.0865,0.1444,0.0023,3.0687,1.3251,4.2188,0.1195,2.511,0.103,0.0137,4.343,4.2668,0.2482,0.1059,0.1402,0.0029,2.7032,0.6864,4.3874,0.1215,2.9991,0.109,0.0128,5.3425,2.2908,0.1203,0.2706,0.0026,2.0344,0.0568,2.6376,1.7752,5.0266,1.293,3.8428,0.6956,4.5569,2.5194,0.0267,1.6301,0.0756,0.0135,4.2932,0.0348,0.0002,0.0002,0.0636,3.83,0.0003,3.5414,3.8247,0.2693,2.73,0.7413,0.8184,4.365,2.5097,0.0535,0.9431,2.9731,0.1647,1.6533,0.1162,0.8051,4.4727,0.0255,1.7955,2.0615,3.5794,5.767,0.7661,3.605,0.1726,1.8173,2.604,0.8398,0.7794,0.4086,2.1371,1.2838,5.7671,1.6866,1.5029,0.5228,3.0209,0.4741,0.4563,0.2337,2.5882,0.2114,1.293,0.0003,2.8975,1.8212,4.6433,0.4967,3.6817,2.9407,0.4178,4.5412,0.7857,2.5928,0.0519,1.1212,0.1487,4.0171,0.957,2.8771,0.4437,1.7978,1.2815,0.4342]}
{"id":4461,"ended":true,"length":384,"gen_text":"On this voyage Arniston sailed under a letter of marque in the name of Captain Peter Wedderburn, and dated 20 March 1806. Her itinerary was : 14 May 1806 : Portsmouth 7 August 1806 : London 12 August 1806 : Portsmouth 16 January 1807 : London 16 January 1807 : Portsmouth 27 July 1807 : Liverpool 26 September 1807 : London 27 September 1807 : Liverpool 20 February 1888 : Hull 16 March 1888 : London 10 August 1870 Captain Wedderburn was not aware of the voyage.\n\nHe had a second letter of marque dated 22 March 1818, probably for a voyage to Southampton. The letter states : The first cargo from the vessel was one hundred and sixty tons of black pepper, on board for the King's troops.\n\nCaptain Wedderburn's cargo manifests for 1806 are not currently available, but the vessel carried a small quantity of spices in 1808, some dates in 1808 are after Captain Wedderburn's death, and the ship carried spices again in 1810, and again in 1812 and 1815.\n\nHowever he remained on the Admiralty rolls in 1832. He was given a certificate of commendation on 13 January 1833 for some ship's work in 1813.\n\nWe do not have any further information regarding Captain Wedderburn's involvement in the affair, although it is possible that he was in Gibraltar and was there on other matters. However his name comes up again in the Admiralty records on 8 March 1841, when he is named as one of two persons who were ordered that day as escorts to Edward Ponsonby. The ships were to sail from St Helena and he was named as the ship's master, the other person being Lieutenant George Thomas. The ship was on her way to New York for the Queen's Jubilee.

{"id":1405,"ended":false,"length":380,"gen_text":"In early 1994, Khoo was retrenched from KFC as a result of an ownership change, despite contributing to increased sales and profitability. He said : Months before leaving my office, I had told my supervisor that I would be leaving KFC... ( Khoo denied claims he was pushed out with a buyout ). Khoo added: I've actually been to work several times since I left KFC but I have never seen a KFC kitchen. This is a very sad state of affairs. This company is so messed up and the management is so poor. No wonder that the chain is going belly up now.\n\n6. The company has always fought with customers over who gets to eat fried poultry; KFC started out by frying chicken only to offer chicken with a gravy the next year. If you want chicken, you have to go elsewhere, and if you want another option, you probably won't like your new KFC. In recent years, chicken has been replaced by a new product: \" chicken fillet, \" an egg salad\/dip-filled version of fried chicken.\n\n7. In 2001, KFC changed the name of the fried chicken to simply \"chicken wings\" in a move to appeal to women. But that name is hardly catchy. According to Consumer Reports, the new name didn't drive sales much, and sales plummeted for two years.\n\nPhoto Credit: Flickr\/Sandy\n\n8. KFC was not the first fast-food chain to use fried chicken as its mainstay. At least 1,350 other U.S. fast-food establishments serve chicken wings, and 1\/2-pound chicken wings typically go for an average price of $2.99. McDonald's has gone the furthest on fried chicken, starting in the 1970s with an array of chicken dishes, such as chicken McNuggets, McRibs and chicken sandwiches. But according to Consumer Reports, McDonald's chicken rarely tastes anything like those at KFC (McDonald's chicken is usually served in thin patties, and with no butter, syrup, or salad dressing).\n\nPhoto Credit: Getty Images\/Chip Somodevilla","token_len":442,"entropy":[6.2884,6.2263,0.2421,8.1426,5.751,1.9124,9.9706,3.3878,0.9673,6.468,4.4049,3.6299,1.0732,2.3612,0.0277,2.9444,8.2925,1.5769,2.0757,6.1691,7.8789,1.1867,8.5959,1.7551,1.6922,2.2943,0.6098,2.0079,4.5734,9.9134,13.7876,2.0425,5.1957,7.722,6.372,0.8742,0.5085,2.4264,4.1138,1.4091,5.1652,0.6332,0.5864,1.3387,1.9211,1.4787,0.9165,0.0019,5.8347,5.3048,7.7774,0.0056,5.7609,5.5569,2.0739,1.1043,4.045,0.0569,5.881,1.4974,5.7209,0.0834,5.44,3.1489,0.0009,4.8316,2.2274,1.571,5.0715,6.2909,1.2565,4.3355,5.0244,5.2508,0.1423,1.3277,1.5449,1.3585,0.8021,0.0014,3.5525,1.0532,2.3433,1.3969,2.4503,2.4775,2.3927,0.0013,4.3946,1.0005,4.6677,0.6969,1.8303,2.8343,1.9212,1.0212,0.0961,0.0166,0.979,4.0304,3.5646,1.4528,4.3244,5.1775,0.0248,3.0328,2.5536,1.7936,0.9888,0.643,4.2795,1.0016,5.0969,1.0528,4.3298,1.5106,5.5983,0.9485,2.3408,4.3504,0.3183,4.7345,0.2896,2.1529,0.5725,6.6361,0.4684,3.1829,3.058,2.2083,5.9137,5.6326,2.3705,4.5346,1.4261,5.1362,2.1569,0.5064,2.9695,5.2855,7.3081,5.338,3.8255,0.0018,5.7087,2.4046,1.5482,5.2307,0.8239,4.6322,3.6707,4.3706,2.8479,3.9793,2.5863,3.911,6.4727,1.1785,0.6435,0.3051,5.7613,0.9818,2.4009,1.6532,0.7465,0.4605,0.7762,0.015,2.1762,1.8516,2.5021,1.9125,2.1778,0.0648,1.1485,7.2544,2.9111,0.3421,0.3404,6.2164,1.3693,0.0009,4.5908,3.3435,2.9781,1.3704,0.0018,0.9016,3.567,4.2294,0.0762,0.1095,4.8906,0.9587,0.5828,2.9879,0.5789,2.8248,3.2999,2.1357,2.3791,2.6889,5.4298,5.432,0.4717,3.627,2.2224,4.3202,4.3172,4.8598,5.9111,3.2059,2.1152,2.6099,4.3354,4.5807,0.1708,2.5411,0.0595,0.6907,1.227,0.0002,0.1989,0.0025,2.6924,4.7669,0.0687,1.0765,0.001,4.14,1.3481,1.3846,0.2001,1.5436,2.3938,0.1481,1.6574,5.6351,0.2472,2.4972,0.0094,5.1825,1.354,1.8749,2.1942,1.96,1.7493,2.4797,0.1304,3.8292,0.5868,3.2706,3.2062,3.0211,2.6842,4.629,2.6319,1.276,4.1418,0.0051,4.388,0.32,0.5614,1.5464,2.5944,0.5077,3.6643,0.0004,5.8858,0.7622,3.3722,1.4021,0.8249,3.1184,5.1029,3.7902,3.3402,0.3,0.6615,0.8513,0.0002,6.5022,2.9475,0.0574,3.4053,1.5556,4.8606,3.8963,3.6923,0.0001,0.4352,0.0028,1.2652,0.0012,3.3747,4.8202,1.3355,0.3033,0.6688,1.1168,0.0045,0.5448,0.0437,2.588,4.302,0.1156,0.9445,2.5519,0.9914,2.912,0.5782,4.8884,1.5914,5.4624,0.1429,5.7549,1.9309,4.4056,0.0009,0.0028,0.0213,0.6304,0.107,0.0029,3.7646,2.6268,1.6372,0.7737,1.1732,2.4698,5.1662,5.4932,2.5848,3.0337,1.2413,3.1574,0.5584,4.6305,3.6487,0.0049,5.4477,0.3356,3.2742,0.0278,0.3554,1.3672,0.0761,2.4714,0.9072,4.3655,0.064,2.2632,5.9234,2.0072,2.0988,0.0012,4.6235,1.3725,0.0392,0.9651,4.4356,1.6187,1.6694,1.9992,0.032,1.2581,4.7419,4.8991,0.0046,2.1557,2.946,1.5032,2.717,0.0031,2.4271,2.3669,0.0049,0.8099,4.6123,2.2257,0.0045,0.8739,0.9948,2.3656,1.9164,0.3295,2.1805,5.0848,0.0039,1.9509,0.0199,0.1977,1.2608,0.0165,1.2612,5.478,1.5584,3.1814,0.1242,5.886,1.7497,0.0764,0.0005,4.2966,2.5195,0.024,0.0185,2.0368,1.0622,3.044,3.0943,1.5359,3.9091,2.4836,0.0214,0.0003,1.2327,2.1609,4.8466,2.8527,5.3605,1.8159,5.0316,1.4233,1.0813,5.9008,0.1945,0.3845,0.5772,0.0002,3.3623,0.0206,0.003,3.9014,0.2055,1.4849,4.8655,0.2103,0.0005,0.0003,0.0]}
{"id":402,"ended":true,"length":413,"gen_text":"By early spring of 1794, the situation in France was dire. With famine looming after the failure of the harvest and the blockade of French ports and trade, the French government was in dire straits. To maintain the strength of the military and the country at large, Napoleon Bonaparte ordered the destruction of the country's valuable French culture, including the arts and sciences.\n\nNapoleon's policy on culture and science is interesting. According to French economist Jean-Jacques Rousseau, before he became a revolutionary, Napoleon had been a man of letters. However, it is interesting to ponder the fact that Napoleon did not see it as his duty to defend the French nation's culture. The French monarchy would perish but for the genius of the French people with their rich cultural heritage\u2014what an irony!\n\nThe policies of destroying French culture and science can be seen in his famous military victory at Waterloo. The French army swept its way across northern England to defeat the Royal and Stuart armies and capture the army of the Holy Roman Emperor. After the battle, Napoleon offered a banquet to some of the French troops. At the end of the banquet, when he left the table, he was attacked by Sir John Fisher. Napoleon was so shaken by the fight that he was unable to sit down for a long time.\n\nIn the aftermath of the defeat, which was so disastrous to the French, there were many who wondered what had been the cause of the war. Was it the nobility of the French soldiers? Were the French people incapable of self-governance. Was the nobility too ignorant to know what they were doing? Did the Emperor's arrogance cause him to take on Britain when the British nation could not possibly contend with him?\n\nIt is known that Napoleon Bonaparte was not the \"most intelligent of men.\" One French historian suggested that in the long run, Napoleon simply gave up on intelligence and instead, relied on sheer determination. On June 14, 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte was found guilty of treason during the French Revolution. He was sentenced to death and executed on May 25, 1821 during the Reign of Terror.\n\nToday's Economist Perspectives from expert contributors.","token_len":443,"entropy":[7.8366,4.3107,2.4373,4.1662,3.9141,0.2335,1.2957,5.4975,1.4262,3.0911,0.7218,3.7774,0.4214,4.3489,6.8651,2.7798,6.7163,0.9207,3.1,0.0782,0.4277,3.8558,2.2629,0.9092,6.6681,0.9804,3.3683,0.166,3.4105,3.1859,0.526,0.8487,1.5746,1.2179,1.3066,2.648,2.8977,0.9754,0.0221,0.2346,3.9491,4.5331,1.5115,4.5665,0.1436,0.5207,2.9425,1.3577,1.5363,3.7168,3.1922,1.1382,0.0752,2.9391,1.5225,0.0,0.0026,3.2938,0.75,4.6178,0.025,0.8928,4.5779,0.0705,5.9006,4.9788,3.9577,1.6693,1.6491,0.9407,4.2348,0.9613,1.3579,0.4104,1.9357,0.0135,2.6582,0.0069,1.619,4.2792,5.1422,1.9721,2.7119,0.7317,2.6007,4.8133,1.8568,4.596,0.0033,3.9629,6.9389,2.3521,0.4181,2.2832,0.0068,0.0346,0.0003,0.0984,6.1145,3.9349,1.3654,1.3196,1.586,0.2943,0.3794,2.1285,1.8534,0.7628,4.2158,0.2325,3.2442,1.2538,4.1762,0.0316,4.0388,1.2929,3.8501,0.3293,8.1379,1.7918,2.1528,0.0202,1.6364,2.8763,0.1056,4.2329,4.1306,0.3261,0.7177,0.7518,0.1142,4.6278,0.514,1.0487,2.4622,1.3044,0.9605,1.0571,3.8022,1.4983,5.1703,4.5005,5.2526,5.4071,3.5781,0.5703,4.4705,0.2116,1.4076,0.6723,0.806,6.5393,0.766,3.8,2.8752,0.6243,5.9069,4.7876,4.6557,1.5801,0.6692,0.4865,0.0002,2.2325,5.7731,0.4301,3.6401,1.4925,0.1665,1.3098,1.6309,4.8382,0.2645,1.1926,0.7541,3.9835,4.0094,5.7075,6.0366,0.5766,0.737,0.9646,2.2566,1.313,1.0073,6.6076,6.5964,0.3613,1.5429,4.443,0.9567,2.7749,2.6154,0.2215,3.8996,6.2992,3.6543,0.6382,2.5321,2.641,0.7373,5.9904,0.9168,0.92,2.8212,0.0079,0.1264,0.8244,3.7323,0.9982,0.9182,0.2628,0.9177,5.4437,1.8279,3.9409,0.6311,6.7794,0.2824,0.2031,2.1179,2.9864,1.4087,3.8303,0.6441,1.4205,0.0899,0.1554,0.9825,0.1333,4.4471,2.2109,4.5286,0.6379,0.5925,0.2583,0.8147,2.2192,4.3682,0.1255,6.4569,1.6609,5.8473,2.2898,3.1805,2.0078,2.6656,4.7835,0.437,0.6343,5.8169,0.2883,0.1552,2.7367,1.1102,0.005,4.6481,0.3202,1.9336,1.8281,1.7439,0.2429,0.31,1.6458,0.0002,3.0586,1.511,1.9565,0.0858,0.8348,4.1685,0.858,5.8884,1.6572,3.4507,3.6047,1.8286,0.6896,0.4317,2.0382,4.6234,1.3001,1.4071,2.282,4.0204,1.8655,1.0727,3.1906,0.733,1.3533,0.2581,0.6532,4.202,0.1759,2.6842,0.2668,1.2708,5.66,1.9726,0.277,1.03,4.6006,0.8137,3.2994,0.7797,1.0117,1.5081,4.5465,0.0665,3.9405,0.0614,1.8153,0.03,7.0345,1.4909,2.1134,4.9779,2.1961,4.2923,1.3516,2.8862,1.3393,1.0689,0.124,0.2201,0.2059,2.8361,0.5314,5.6263,2.8937,4.1957,2.8044,0.4858,0.0124,4.0217,2.5688,6.0602,4.2185,2.1344,3.0174,5.2902,3.3367,0.7843,3.2106,6.1776,0.2502,1.4521,0.1513,0.8497,0.0002,3.0656,0.8351,5.1128,0.1684,0.8814,1.877,0.0001,0.0046,1.2978,2.1388,2.2849,4.5486,4.0156,2.4213,2.523,0.189,0.7911,5.0395,4.2668,1.1313,4.9187,0.1396,4.83,2.0169,4.7997,0.4897,0.4018,0.6744,5.8143,5.6953,1.013,0.7375,5.7988,1.1099,3.509,4.4051,1.9767,0.1811,3.6605,5.6335,0.8889,5.8679,3.4649,3.3177,0.1097,0.6172,1.8359,0.0668,0.8947,2.4939,0.0001,0.0037,1.6621,5.0605,0.6697,0.2193,1.2551,6.1824,0.6698,1.7648,0.2154,0.6286,1.4354,0.1621,1.2254,0.0185,0.3243,1.6736,0.9461,0.8309,2.6735,2.8108,0.0221,0.1085,0.2642,6.4263,0.3962,0.6619,0.0038,0.0004,0.394,0.556,0.0002,4.625,4.0614,5.3151,0.7658,0.0001,0.0048,0.0049,0.0103,0.0009]}
{"id":4769,"ended":false,"length":420,"gen_text":"Several critics theorized about the effects of the shift from scarcity to abundance of written material in the media as a result of the technologies introduced by the Internet. This shift was examined for example in a chapter in the Journal of Communication by Paul J. Buhler, Thomas B. McAlister and Thomas K. Rafferty.\n\nAn interesting finding was that the new information environment could change people's attitudes about science, even if they are not willing to change their behavior. The book also looked at the effects on media literacy, and found that people who used the Internet for their news and entertainment did not seem to have changed their behavior with respect to their scientific literacy.\n\nAnother study I found interesting dealt with how the way we study the environment impacts society. A scientist published a study on the role of the media in promoting a particular perspective on climate change. He used newspaper articles in the Washington Post as an example. Using a computer program to translate some newspaper articles and books, he found that it was unlikely there would be a significant difference in climate coverage if only newspapers published some of the pieces, and those that included scientists, or even if any of them. The media tended to avoid articles on climate change, however, if they included scientists or had some sort of scientist in the author's bio.\n\nIn the book chapter, this scientist also explained that because the media only showed what was easy for the average reader to understand, there was a tendency to avoid research that is too difficult or confusing. The same author wrote a study on media education. The research showed that many people thought that a high school graduate had a better understanding of climate change and human-caused global warming than did a high school graduate who only finished the first year of college.\n\nWe live in a \"digital\" time at UofT, a place where we are constantly on the go. If we think that the new information environment might change our attitudes about science or our behavior, then we might want to consider how the new technologies might change those things for us, and perhaps even make it possible for us to study any topic we could dream up in the age of constant, free, information.\n\nAdvertisements","token_len":445,"entropy":[7.5743,9.7262,0.5828,5.5327,1.0999,6.0989,0.2529,1.3761,6.5953,2.7348,9.5919,0.1735,0.092,4.0941,10.6793,2.7844,2.3673,0.6811,4.8927,5.361,1.0357,1.4549,0.197,0.734,7.4626,5.7402,0.971,0.7448,1.6462,0.5481,3.6419,2.0601,2.7488,7.4411,5.0091,4.4493,0.8406,1.2761,4.4416,1.7069,1.4984,5.3886,0.0669,1.6778,2.9139,4.4734,3.8104,0.1137,5.2766,2.1149,2.3516,1.4066,5.4361,3.3444,0.3461,4.5582,4.2351,1.0313,1.2409,4.0213,4.0639,0.3551,4.878,4.1595,0.0001,1.0744,1.7656,0.0029,5.2173,2.6614,4.4065,1.7715,0.3428,1.4861,5.2345,3.2978,1.9407,4.7645,4.0599,1.9659,0.0426,2.218,1.9512,5.1203,1.7569,3.6133,1.3065,0.8061,3.6597,0.8037,4.415,0.029,1.2785,0.0573,1.5843,0.3714,2.1549,5.2038,3.3848,4.5725,0.1459,0.8844,1.6656,3.1394,4.0092,1.9774,1.9482,2.1186,1.5764,0.3222,3.113,0.9341,3.7165,0.4358,0.2347,2.3788,3.1175,1.8228,1.3717,2.2072,3.5997,0.8853,3.7281,0.0511,1.6851,4.0504,0.1473,1.6397,4.6416,0.6471,0.0023,1.8154,3.3361,1.0292,0.314,0.7625,0.0002,3.5158,2.3366,5.3725,0.9804,1.595,5.2903,0.0158,2.3466,1.3088,5.6869,2.0182,5.5347,1.9012,3.5954,4.6026,5.7109,0.6463,3.0564,5.7713,5.7557,0.4816,1.4437,2.3805,0.8915,4.5408,0.1667,1.9115,1.0282,0.2019,3.4638,2.9407,3.3758,5.1595,0.5158,1.2305,0.0302,0.4053,1.7652,3.4637,4.3321,0.9402,3.3542,1.1697,4.5916,0.101,2.2966,1.8794,0.3574,0.7209,5.4865,1.835,2.6093,0.7701,1.6312,5.569,5.0515,3.3998,0.0786,3.7293,5.2446,0.9391,0.4275,0.8776,0.1821,4.8281,0.4886,5.6745,6.1348,0.7751,0.2,0.9369,1.8721,1.7383,0.5485,3.5016,3.7561,1.205,3.4192,2.1008,2.3097,6.417,1.1944,0.1816,5.0648,1.9707,1.5324,5.1886,1.6571,5.087,4.3769,3.3057,3.2064,3.6067,1.3937,6.3617,1.4773,1.8705,2.011,2.2301,2.6856,5.3511,0.0302,5.2787,3.1283,2.67,1.146,0.2169,2.5543,4.7473,0.2639,1.3435,0.5783,2.5209,1.5644,1.7874,4.044,3.7712,3.694,0.0017,5.3317,1.6078,0.4257,2.9346,0.9165,2.0239,0.1258,0.7665,0.0002,2.8685,2.071,2.2014,6.3077,1.5975,4.4563,1.978,2.2318,4.7934,1.1946,4.9163,1.3423,0.6341,5.1477,4.0647,4.1558,1.3542,4.9959,2.206,1.2575,1.6735,1.2969,0.3803,0.94,0.1457,3.1952,0.4057,1.4123,1.2562,0.5161,4.4794,5.3666,0.8819,2.8315,3.7231,1.1776,2.3311,4.4104,0.8334,2.5873,3.9652,3.3131,3.9324,1.2622,3.3008,1.0961,3.9114,5.4395,2.0137,2.5714,3.9399,1.4239,0.116,3.8522,0.9472,4.6666,0.932,3.5659,4.3878,0.3361,2.1843,1.9905,1.2499,1.9817,0.8786,0.0524,2.4256,0.1899,4.1471,4.2032,1.0704,0.4263,0.0009,1.7074,0.0093,0.1087,2.1874,0.3562,1.0362,0.0161,0.228,1.3452,3.0852,4.2479,3.9706,1.332,0.819,0.0637,0.3739,0.1092,1.0706,0.0002,5.3928,4.2384,0.0319,0.5269,5.1162,4.358,2.4579,4.7357,6.7368,7.495,3.4628,0.6193,1.216,3.8651,4.9795,0.3599,1.7868,1.8113,1.3676,3.9508,0.2738,0.8628,1.2228,4.363,0.708,3.7755,2.4886,1.6088,4.0013,2.2,0.2054,4.2017,2.1872,0.9304,1.4654,0.9056,0.5844,2.0533,1.3799,1.4115,0.8501,1.598,1.0345,2.058,1.0296,0.0087,2.2471,1.5551,1.793,1.2283,2.0297,1.0828,1.5374,4.25,1.2709,2.9293,0.5676,2.6805,1.7886,3.3737,2.3198,3.6204,2.5978,3.4348,0.5714,0.2196,0.0215,4.0273,6.6658,1.4857,1.5811,5.7164,3.2071,0.4057,2.3841,1.2056,5.1104,0.0168,6.2752,3.9661,3.6888,1.802,3.8417,0.1784,0.6146,0.0002,3.8513]}
{"id":20,"ended":false,"length":388,"gen_text":"In 2009, Fernandez traveled to India for a modeling assignment. She studied acting under the mentorship of theatre director Barry John, and successfully auditioned for Sujoy Ghosh's fantasy film Aladin (the movie won the Bollywood Award for Best Film in 2011 ). During her time in India, she also worked as a waitress at the Rizvi Bazaar, and a call girl at the Starwood Hotel in New York City.\n\nFernandez began training for MMA training before she began acting. Her first appearance on The Ultimate Fighter (TUF) was where she got picked up and placed on the roster in the final three contestants that were competing in season 14. Following her elimination, Fernandez fought the final leg of her fight camp on a golf course in New Jersey, with UFC Head Coach Chael Sonnen coaching her. Fernandez later stated via Instagram that the fight camp was supposed to be completed in 8 hours, but she was forced to spend 12 hours preparing due to the time she spent preparing for the TUF season. She was eventually granted a full exemption and the fight against Vanessa Cariappa was booked.\n\nHer UFC debut came against Cariappa in the third episode of the UFC on FX 9 Finale. Fernandez took a round to the body in the first, but held her own during the rest of the fight to give her the win, scoring 5 of the 11 rounds in the fight. In the next five outings, she put together a 5-4 record, and earned her first professional win against Christina Yoon.\n\nShe would hold her first two professional wins as a mixed martial artist in a unanimous decision win against Jessica Penne and a decision over Felice Herrig. During her UFC stint, Fernandez has fought three finishes in MMA, with her most recent two bouts coming in the UFC on FOX 10 headliner against Jessica Penne and in the Fight Night 26 lightweight bout with Felice Herrig.\n\nFernandez's next bout will be a bout against JoAnn Calderwood on the FOX Sports 1 preliminaries on January 9th.\n\nYou can follow Kelapao on Twitter @KelapaoFitness & Instagram @KelapaoFitness","token_len":445,"entropy":[5.7797,0.2109,10.6022,6.7898,0.1582,4.9497,2.5881,0.88,8.1413,2.1185,0.9765,2.1174,7.2756,5.9321,3.8573,1.8059,4.9723,0.0104,0.0033,8.8317,0.8663,7.8679,7.3025,2.62,1.2988,8.0101,0.7656,0.0015,0.1871,9.9092,2.298,0.0366,0.0425,0.3079,8.7156,1.4434,7.3032,5.6921,3.162,4.1968,3.1482,4.0446,0.8325,4.767,0.8834,3.0345,0.116,0.2241,1.3158,1.4927,2.2979,6.461,4.796,0.8124,1.3742,0.2376,0.2849,0.0498,0.863,1.5613,2.3998,1.0228,0.3831,3.6918,1.611,1.8469,4.3849,3.4152,0.1694,3.8916,0.7753,1.8424,2.2135,4.3402,4.832,0.4964,1.4498,1.1151,5.9022,2.7355,0.7974,1.037,2.0971,2.1615,0.7686,0.1661,0.9403,0.0221,1.7443,0.0092,3.6524,5.4912,1.9245,2.9635,3.8022,6.5322,1.4198,2.3892,2.2768,0.9847,2.8975,0.921,4.2994,2.1443,3.2421,0.3808,0.0001,1.7925,0.0416,0.0057,0.0939,1.2623,6.3742,0.1253,4.2152,5.5269,1.3262,3.2976,2.1036,0.9628,0.6152,4.0965,3.36,1.5296,3.8493,2.7795,4.5791,4.2214,1.2966,2.6024,1.8553,3.6734,3.151,0.5644,5.5877,0.8585,3.5784,0.6194,1.7163,4.1081,4.1148,1.9046,5.1308,0.0687,1.5621,2.7275,2.1813,3.7035,2.7577,5.277,0.0452,0.8008,3.1017,0.7963,1.5328,3.3916,3.1703,5.41,0.1538,4.26,0.0135,0.0025,0.0001,2.1956,0.2961,0.8427,3.0684,4.9193,2.1295,6.8105,2.4189,0.3321,2.3942,2.8402,0.8758,0.4741,6.0868,0.0029,0.6636,4.9029,1.4078,5.3418,1.6328,0.4352,0.3257,1.3995,1.6436,3.073,0.037,3.5637,3.6331,0.1554,5.0802,3.5666,0.0031,1.7112,2.8995,2.5621,1.3978,3.4548,0.4067,0.9219,1.3462,0.0019,2.0293,0.4673,2.4114,2.1167,2.9234,5.688,0.5544,4.2825,3.0462,2.9377,3.2813,2.143,2.5374,4.4074,5.7724,3.3839,2.8279,0.5233,3.3413,1.1345,0.5314,0.0002,3.8472,2.901,0.1314,1.2889,1.1132,1.7739,0.1823,0.002,1.5825,1.9088,4.3482,0.853,0.0768,1.0221,4.2247,1.128,2.0336,3.5127,1.0125,0.0004,0.8921,1.3443,3.4066,1.4755,4.2372,1.0412,1.4419,1.0748,1.9249,0.188,0.8646,3.5812,0.6358,4.4945,0.431,0.1937,4.7011,0.2161,2.0526,0.0135,0.0454,0.4036,3.691,4.7234,1.4155,1.7084,1.1913,3.3807,3.5863,6.7694,1.2215,1.5946,3.2246,1.8902,1.934,0.3786,0.7329,0.2631,3.066,0.9369,4.5874,5.757,5.0076,0.2105,1.4173,6.2611,0.3449,0.8055,2.5064,0.0343,2.9213,0.1242,1.0284,2.6016,3.2929,2.1386,0.6906,3.4845,1.0785,1.5716,5.256,4.034,2.9604,1.3975,1.2939,0.0002,3.0456,2.4793,6.2577,2.485,1.8381,3.3897,1.1347,0.8379,4.9053,0.4265,3.9485,0.0376,0.0507,1.5768,3.5778,3.9444,0.0237,1.3859,1.6206,2.59,1.4264,0.002,1.155,0.3966,3.0197,1.6495,4.2152,0.016,0.0015,0.0003,0.4243,4.3826,0.8168,2.055,3.1675,0.1762,0.7422,4.01,2.286,3.429,8.3965,1.9502,6.4003,0.8689,2.2623,1.3679,1.2135,0.4367,4.5598,4.3043,1.177,1.7785,1.2877,1.1718,1.3602,1.2286,2.8986,3.2019,0.0879,0.8545,1.7418,1.7402,0.0001,0.1999,3.6215,0.5661,4.8433,1.2357,4.0658,4.3594,0.5055,1.8254,3.477,0.0003,0.0013,0.0041,0.1053,0.5766,0.0002,1.193,0.0087,2.2402,2.4753,1.3254,1.4374,0.4296,2.0198,3.3687,0.4989,4.8614,6.7109,0.3179,0.0041,1.5324,1.8226,4.7251,0.9854,0.0545,0.9448,4.3101,0.0032,1.0449,2.6078,3.8722,0.8789,0.8855,1.0319,0.0002,3.077,0.0564,0.399,4.6882,4.1971,0.2475,0.4575,0.4232,0.3342,1.1775,0.0089,0.0348,0.0093,3.1557,3.9369,4.0862,2.1117,0.1157,0.9108,0.0062,0.0219,0.0581,0.4647,0.028]}
{"id":1049,"ended":true,"length":423,"gen_text":"`` Swing Low, Sweet Chariot `` is very commonly sung at England fixtures \u2013 especially at Twickenham. The song arrived in the rugby canon through the Welsh male voice choirs who sang many of the songs in that rugby union sport since the 1960's. The tradition of men singing songs in response to English rugby contests did not take off until the 1980's. The first major example of a singing band called the Band of the Golden Lions is described in the history of Welsh rugby league. In the mid-1970's three young boys on the Welsh North Antrim Rugby Club picked up on these traditions but no one in the union or the game noticed it. It was not until 1986 that the Welsh government started sponsoring the bands and started playing for them in the first official game with England. A few of the bands were chosen from members of the elite teams. The more junior teams tend to have no representation and the bands played with little support from the union.

{"id":2690,"ended":true,"length":400,"gen_text":"Waxy produced 190 winners in his stud career, including four winners of the Epsom Derby and three winners of the Epsom Oaks. His first Derby winner, Waxy Pope, was foaled when he was three weeks old in the year 1866 and won the race at the prestigious Epsom Oaks. In 1868 he produced the first race winner to follow a winner to the post, the two year old Charlie Crozier, who won the Epsom Oaks.\n\nWaxy's success is largely credited to his thoroughbred breeding and skill in working with his animals, although he knew that he needed to increase the amount of winning he could achieve. This led him to breed with more powerful champions that could be expected to win on a regular basis, and to work with a winning team. This led to his winning ability being significantly bettered by other thoroughbreds.\n\nWaxy's greatest success came at the Epsom Oaks in 1872. There, during the first time that a winner was bettered after it, Waxy won the Grand Derby and the Epsom Derby. He finished second during the Epsom Oaks in 1874. He was foaled in 1877 and sold to John James from Edinburgh in September 1878. At this time, his name had become well known among racing enthusiasts.\n\nIn the latter part of the 19th century, horse racing fell from great success. Many owners were leaving racing as a result and owners were more confident in their ability to provide for their horses rather than on their horses. This led to a decline in breeding. The horse racing industry had lost its dominance over stock market markets, and stock markets had shifted to a more liquid basis.\n\nIt is not necessary to understand horse racing to understand Waxy Pope. He produced a highly successful track for his family and did his business well. He was the greatest horse racer of the 1800s.\n\nHe is the first documented horse breeder to be elected to the British Order of Merit - a British equivalent of the American Order of the Golden Eagle and the European Order of the Equestrian Order of Merit - for his outstanding achievements in the horse racing industry.\n\nSource: Wikipedia.","token_len":447,"entropy":[10.3446,10.3605,9.7601,9.2754,1.4622,3.8155,13.6908,6.918,1.0602,2.3024,3.6624,4.4242,3.503,0.1955,11.4699,0.1151,0.8351,2.5276,1.7735,1.7226,0.1436,0.0496,3.5669,0.0,5.1392,0.4441,3.127,3.2891,3.2572,2.4455,2.44,6.3291,0.2866,12.9073,0.3977,1.1103,9.6992,0.6124,5.8616,0.6589,0.0727,3.6478,1.2569,0.0359,2.5892,2.8644,4.2507,1.9138,3.9152,2.1722,1.6399,0.9068,1.8939,1.5446,1.4791,6.9032,0.257,0.0001,1.8564,1.485,3.1033,1.5927,1.9469,1.2706,2.966,2.402,1.4053,4.4155,0.2458,2.3195,6.2255,2.0603,2.9961,3.8238,0.4441,3.2039,1.3978,2.4573,4.8292,1.3219,0.1956,5.4401,5.5442,3.9335,0.0101,1.2928,0.6662,0.6582,0.3774,0.4899,0.0001,1.0848,1.8416,1.6044,0.0099,1.3963,0.0093,2.115,3.311,4.3637,4.3358,1.8796,0.1435,0.5309,4.7563,0.1219,1.5811,2.094,5.7474,1.0684,3.9801,1.0506,1.4055,2.8461,2.0023,4.1946,1.1389,6.3984,1.5044,2.1709,1.7597,0.5604,4.742,0.8786,3.2556,0.0206,4.2063,1.8043,1.5363,1.0969,0.738,3.5791,1.8853,0.8811,0.0597,3.8235,4.4068,3.7882,4.2041,5.4369,4.4215,1.8909,3.2929,2.1483,0.0135,0.8796,3.9071,1.7676,0.5329,0.006,1.473,1.7277,2.1017,2.5595,0.7309,2.9812,4.1822,2.5519,1.5522,2.7654,1.8667,0.2173,2.1272,2.0895,5.3677,1.8753,5.0987,7.6488,0.0053,0.8416,2.1812,2.9805,0.0018,1.6428,1.3639,0.9011,0.0002,0.9683,0.0024,1.6332,4.2394,1.751,1.1498,2.2938,0.5093,0.4288,0.0001,1.7649,0.9719,0.5667,2.141,2.053,3.2445,2.0662,6.2166,0.5325,2.45,4.5587,1.8229,1.4673,2.297,1.2796,3.9329,3.2845,3.0779,5.5128,4.9873,0.5514,0.0004,4.1095,0.926,6.8951,1.1462,1.9488,1.4732,0.3442,0.0001,1.6936,0.8855,1.5572,3.839,0.8934,6.4371,0.0969,0.375,0.0,0.1483,1.6312,0.0969,1.6814,2.366,1.8316,1.837,4.8599,0.0031,1.0026,0.7148,3.0637,0.6217,5.4494,0.795,3.1912,5.9958,5.9772,5.0261,1.5185,4.9192,0.521,0.7987,0.4669,4.3204,1.8779,0.2682,1.2992,3.6438,3.4474,3.0467,1.125,1.4639,0.0682,4.0343,2.1158,1.7873,1.3267,0.9129,0.0002,1.9444,2.0374,5.4125,0.6954,0.0013,0.5433,1.8161,0.0048,0.1961,0.3525,6.6916,0.1554,5.5644,3.6083,5.5064,5.3191,1.2373,3.0774,2.8317,2.1354,4.8088,2.2074,3.5248,2.2714,2.1318,2.1702,4.8019,1.3372,3.9677,5.4863,0.8228,1.8101,1.2986,0.0627,4.7995,2.7923,0.1687,0.5741,3.5856,0.0065,5.1834,1.5581,1.5766,0.1932,2.0161,1.552,0.09,1.332,1.3107,0.0246,4.1363,2.1725,2.4882,4.6468,0.6397,0.4036,2.8601,3.4234,1.0932,4.8231,2.5617,6.8208,5.1498,2.8073,1.8669,0.9193,3.027,1.3158,1.4341,6.4044,1.1281,2.7594,0.9648,4.3685,4.5133,0.4226,1.4003,0.0002,3.9033,1.4817,2.4983,6.248,0.188,3.3462,4.3955,0.0684,0.8631,0.8261,0.9118,0.0005,1.4404,0.6957,1.6681,4.7605,1.9557,5.5044,0.837,5.4579,4.8201,2.0866,4.5114,1.1273,5.1303,3.9723,4.2382,2.3318,0.4307,1.3275,1.2112,3.5078,4.4916,1.6722,3.2313,0.7609,1.6922,4.893,0.277,1.1797,1.4399,0.0002,3.9505,1.9958,2.5773,2.8653,4.64,1.6144,3.8829,0.0,0.5996,1.9296,5.1617,0.5234,0.3899,2.0874,3.7744,0.0045,0.5431,0.0134,5.8156,2.3878,3.4568,2.068,0.5882,0.1141,0.9499,0.5473,0.0014,1.2222,2.0234,3.4444,3.9288,0.6685,3.4456,0.3744,0.0098,0.9338,4.0656,0.0468,0.0424,0.4951,0.4453,1.5182,0.0021,2.2849,1.6954,0.6023,2.0553,1.9337,0.6117,1.0566,2.3866,0.3187,0.0983,0.1456,0.6813,0.0002,5.0773,0.2503,1.7907,1.8493]}

As offensive coordinator Chad Morris's first team was shutout in its first four game starts of the season, this will be a huge test, and this is where the defense can give Clemson what it wants in 2016.\n\n\nIt will be interesting to see how many people who were calling this game wrong have come around on Clemson for the final score.\n\nCUTLER\n\n\u2014 No, you didn't miss much. Clemson's offense did more than enough while holding the Gamecocks to three field goals.\n\n\u2014 The Clemson defense, especially the secondary, played a big role in the late-game, dramatic drive. Defensive end Shaq Lawson's second-quarter sack of Simmons for a loss of seven yards was a big difference in this game.\n\n\u2014 This was not as good a showing as Clemson's offensive lines have shown in spring drills (six tackles for loss vs. 10 for loss).\n\n\u2014 When your offense gets to the two yard line with only 28 seconds on the clock...it's hard to argue.\n\n\n\u2014 Clemson's defense is going to need to prove it's healthy over the next two months due to injuries on defense. As long as the defense can stay healthy, this will be a team to be reckoned with in 2016.\n\n\u2014 Clemson's running game did a pretty good job of getting on the field early in this game, but it did lack offensive firepower early on. Clemson ran the ball four times in the first half, with Deon Cain running for 22 yards. On defense, Jordan Howard was on for 12 yards on the first drive.\n\n\n\u2014 Clemson's defense played its best with its defense behind it, particularly in the second half. However, the Tigers have to play better, because not even Clemson can afford to play sloppy football the rest of the way.","token_len":448,"entropy":[3.5293,10.187,2.0801,8.8216,0.3013,2.8548,1.8498,5.8333,14.9355,9.4827,9.0715,6.535,0.3626,1.5466,5.6182,0.3339,2.2159,4.2414,5.035,7.2274,1.9031,0.9792,0.0167,0.013,2.6394,1.1771,2.1449,1.1139,3.949,13.0471,0.2427,7.7451,2.4377,5.3821,0.3275,0.3242,2.7094,8.8858,6.7352,4.6621,1.613,5.5411,4.9425,3.6354,4.0186,0.0003,4.2751,0.8445,2.0291,4.4182,1.5011,2.2236,1.1347,0.5756,2.049,4.8966,4.7641,1.4358,2.5593,0.8292,4.6547,0.4763,1.2845,0.8992,1.9698,6.3703,2.8473,10.7911,5.2097,0.6315,0.0845,2.5948,1.7113,1.4042,0.0953,0.0006,0.2468,5.2306,6.0099,0.106,0.2639,0.0039,6.4849,4.1372,5.0885,4.5826,5.0543,1.7948,1.0452,1.3112,1.2169,2.863,5.2903,4.3476,3.3693,0.3616,0.2971,0.1895,2.8899,4.1562,0.3345,1.0489,2.7392,1.4689,4.4243,1.3374,4.4845,1.7583,2.7618,1.0849,3.074,2.7175,4.668,2.1574,4.209,0.1099,2.8025,3.3788,5.7488,0.3292,1.2384,0.0002,4.1001,2.5021,0.4274,1.7058,0.0372,0.0443,0.7721,3.5588,5.1165,5.5061,2.6664,3.6725,2.3782,0.6253,3.188,3.539,2.9506,1.0632,3.2534,1.6012,5.7555,0.9464,3.9219,1.5237,0.5079,2.7898,0.0001,5.364,5.3702,2.3147,3.9493,0.0002,5.6181,5.0914,2.8845,3.5809,2.5072,0.0013,1.8273,3.5845,1.1316,3.2713,1.2086,2.5828,3.2285,4.8553,0.9315,1.0108,6.6136,1.8508,2.4101,5.0353,0.0104,0.0,0.3322,3.5812,2.0791,0.0346,1.4335,1.8243,0.0002,0.3297,2.3477,2.7504,0.707,3.054,4.4167,0.9158,0.7058,0.1069,2.3904,2.2675,1.9116,0.799,0.2049,1.21,6.2804,1.4089,0.1355,4.6641,3.999,4.245,0.4894,5.5586,1.7241,1.825,0.0095,0.0021,3.0882,4.2904,1.5127,0.2896,0.4006,1.056,3.6248,3.8513,0.1446,1.181,0.0033,2.4499,0.2228,1.0971,1.4714,2.004,4.7309,2.4098,2.5724,0.2169,0.4569,1.2422,0.0002,0.2443,4.1957,1.4548,3.9546,4.4425,1.7054,1.4413,2.8197,1.2719,2.1836,0.9227,2.2143,6.1849,2.2696,2.384,1.2428,6.5933,3.3667,5.2091,5.6127,2.7682,0.0689,0.0467,4.7178,0.0439,4.6003,1.0931,0.5652,1.3697,1.771,0.0002,0.3892,5.4737,4.6803,3.0239,3.6185,2.4963,0.5392,4.4312,1.1174,0.0488,3.0799,4.151,5.556,0.0394,3.0163,0.0055,0.0691,5.1641,2.9868,0.4471,2.7919,0.2056,3.5782,2.0116,2.6168,0.0002,1.9431,2.6888,1.1592,1.7755,2.3135,2.1979,0.009,2.1065,0.2188,4.6959,0.4213,1.6833,4.0315,5.4792,0.0521,0.7098,2.0951,1.6974,6.8415,0.0087,1.5385,2.8084,3.0734,0.6564,5.7153,2.5947,0.0084,1.29,1.9197,1.6552,2.1715,0.173,0.3861,2.1015,2.3354,0.1789,0.3614,3.294,1.3035,1.4708,0.488,0.0037,1.3074,0.882,0.0776,0.5907,0.0002,1.4901,2.643,1.0505,3.2057,0.6641,3.0998,1.9861,4.2512,0.2353,0.0155,1.0233,2.2477,5.4171,0.263,0.9342,2.7077,1.7292,1.4308,0.0976,1.3061,0.8872,1.4558,3.304,5.6122,6.0385,4.5309,3.1787,1.2691,0.3643,3.4399,3.8519,1.2773,0.0258,3.6708,0.0432,0.6761,0.1471,0.1216,1.1278,0.8102,3.0514,5.4063,0.12,0.0048,4.0922,0.6485,4.4436,0.0546,1.376,4.494,5.2372,0.0538,5.6974,3.7783,2.4473,3.7521,3.7775,3.9868,0.6624,0.7752,2.3176,1.1637,1.3872,1.2596,2.2917,0.0002,0.349,1.4955,1.006,1.6397,2.6676,3.1177,0.2507,5.5242,3.1035,2.1199,5.1764,0.2866,1.3944,4.8455,1.2139,0.2258,0.3575,0.0721,0.2807,5.744,0.0098,1.2957,1.8918,3.1875,0.753,3.0058,0.5885,4.5491,3.2894,6.3999,3.4893,3.178,2.1425,2.5774,0.2515,2.772,3.2905,1.2,4.9969,0.2433,0.001,0.0539,0.8182,0.2312]}

They then took the song to the tour bus on the final day of recording for the album with Trent Reznor playing a little organ and their bass guitarist helping on the guitar.\n\n-- Nine is the eighth song titled after a number.\n\n-- Nine is the first single by a group to earn two Grammy nominations in 2011.\n\n-- Nine was the first track released by a group to earn two song of the summer nods.\n\n-- Nine appears on the video game Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock.","token_len":449,"entropy":[8.0212,2.1397,7.7309,8.9652,10.6833,1.0401,4.6282,0.472,1.4484,7.923,3.155,12.3063,16.3333,7.6072,0.04,2.1965,6.19,1.8219,7.0759,2.8097,4.4333,7.8277,0.0016,5.4787,3.026,2.7078,1.0776,0.1668,5.9822,4.8694,3.1707,2.5511,6.6886,2.228,3.3972,6.6596,0.0563,1.8734,0.9864,0.9716,4.2226,1.8457,3.03,0.9089,0.0035,5.1188,5.7975,1.3835,3.105,4.3513,2.3985,2.4217,3.8368,1.8896,4.7011,2.9362,5.0422,4.6937,1.8897,5.1267,3.4175,3.4301,1.7375,2.512,0.5998,1.5179,2.0914,0.4338,6.3171,1.4644,5.5129,1.2372,6.2542,0.0924,1.4374,2.2781,2.3958,2.1646,0.6269,7.0486,2.4497,4.6132,0.4447,1.3726,0.5946,0.0002,0.2054,1.4988,1.9886,5.581,3.6678,0.1608,6.5539,1.1214,1.4,0.7004,5.378,5.7755,0.4766,3.6016,0.5122,0.1256,2.4104,0.2112,5.1929,0.827,2.5347,0.0002,0.0105,5.3423,5.1721,0.395,2.0862,8.9301,3.6858,6.3674,4.0824,3.0787,1.4136,2.5625,3.7165,0.2801,4.7161,0.2472,1.5649,2.6823,5.7533,2.7036,1.8214,5.6179,5.4827,0.502,0.0068,0.6036,2.537,0.3681,3.4036,4.6483,6.4302,3.0061,5.3542,2.5755,1.2407,4.2412,0.0019,2.6973,1.8218,1.208,4.4432,2.3924,1.325,2.7857,0.2925,3.9852,2.194,4.107,0.6659,4.5535,1.0196,3.1004,3.8087,3.5595,2.0731,0.4205,2.9462,2.7106,2.3619,2.8718,2.4117,0.1841,1.2707,0.3061,0.0303,2.3515,5.1119,0.2128,1.9322,6.7023,0.4045,0.7958,5.5047,4.3091,0.033,0.9674,0.5106,0.0002,0.1926,2.7864,0.0001,4.0881,3.429,4.4424,5.6122,1.1211,3.8258,4.2834,2.6694,0.8457,0.1955,1.3898,1.8616,0.5817,4.15,4.1464,3.1869,4.0686,0.8324,0.8284,0.0002,0.2592,6.1968,2.0077,5.0551,2.3777,0.4345,1.0335,1.1052,0.99,3.4229,7.7606,0.1568,0.0022,0.5961,0.0006,0.0036,5.1808,3.0273,0.4308,0.2287,3.6445,3.6292,0.6564,0.1396,5.3617,0.7078,1.8664,4.0374,0.1057,2.6344,0.0033,0.7581,3.7388,1.6961,0.672,0.0081,1.2768,4.1847,0.0542,2.646,0.0129,0.0,4.114,0.8626,1.4091,0.5909,2.0766,3.4514,0.8614,0.5397,0.0002,0.3394,2.8707,0.0001,5.127,0.9028,6.5425,0.9457,0.1135,0.7411,2.8778,0.4775,0.0139,4.5319,4.87,5.386,1.8334,0.0097,0.0013,0.2703,0.8853,5.0356,2.2353,2.8732,3.4343,4.5581,2.1424,3.9357,4.4848,1.1815,0.5958,4.0137,1.6183,5.9317,0.9268,1.6796,4.0407,1.8785,1.9469,2.5361,0.1112,0.0659,6.4602,2.8816,0.2805,5.7298,0.8927,1.8912,0.1161,1.2984,0.6579,3.7532,3.6867,2.534,6.1813,0.7896,0.2976,0.0004,3.3277,2.5911,1.2344,0.3189,0.0009,0.0541,0.0119,0.0019,0.0289,0.0034,0.0006,0.0111,0.1467,1.6342,3.3622,4.3835,0.616,2.6748,3.2032,3.6655,4.3746,1.2718,4.445,0.4252,3.8018,0.4815,3.0823,2.2244,3.0078,0.5964,2.4922,0.5826,1.5944,6.4927,0.2071,4.1823,1.154,3.6141,0.4164,0.2037,2.5676,2.5149,0.2265,0.1773,4.5432,4.6227,0.0715,0.0,3.4777,3.3976,5.0362,4.9249,1.9532,6.1026,2.9761,4.1222,6.1856,3.229,0.821,2.226,0.3255,0.5912,0.0002,0.1461,5.8822,6.0949,0.3698,3.4053,1.9568,7.5646,0.6056,1.1587,1.786,2.0766,1.7081,0.0002,0.1104,0.5646,0.645,0.2231,1.2345,2.1186,3.2129,0.3903,2.7874,1.1825,5.0165,3.6972,2.2031,0.101,1.9631,2.6813,0.3425,0.7359,0.0002,0.1689,0.214,1.4008,0.9079,1.2159,3.6622,2.1865,1.296,0.712,1.4474,1.1503,1.8323,1.6568,7.4233,2.2525,0.0053,3.0661,2.6942,1.4206,0.4884,0.0002,0.1024,0.1446,6.6612,0.314,0.6995,5.6197,0.3073,3.3315,0.001,1.236,0.5418,0.0239,0.004,0.002,0.7912]}

When the man's family found out what happened, they believed Phil and the police arrested him for homicide. As a result, Diane is arrested, with Phil being the prime suspect. Phil's wife, now pregnant with their second child, is unable to care for the baby and he is incarcerated for murder.\n\nIt is revealed that Diane had actually been taking part in the plot to frame Phil. She had been sending him e-mails with information about Jerry and Diane so Phil would think her daughter was living in California. She had given him the number of Phil's former fiancee so he wouldn't call the police.

{"id":342,"ended":false,"length":440,"gen_text":"`` New Year's Eve `` received several positive reviews from critics. New York writer Steven Heisler praised the episode for avoiding `` sitcom @ - @ y territory `` with the emotional ending, while writer Richard Roeper found the new story line fun. `` The writers worked hard because they loved the material and were happy that they knew where the ending was going to end up,'' he said. `` The writers worked hard because they loved the material and were happy that they knew where the ending was going to end up. `` Although the second season ended with a cliffhanger that didn't add much to the storyline, New York Times TV critic Margaret Lyons thought the episode was `` one of the best of the year ` because '' it had characters who are complex but not just dumb. A great example: Mr. Bergstrom, the high school principal who takes over the school while Mr. Bergstrom is gone, is a little hard to like, but he's really the opposite, and the writers are not afraid to use him, to go there. And we get to learn who Richard Bergstrom is during the second half of the series.'' In fact, New York magazine television critic Jay Willis praised `` for not over-stressing the relationship between the two main characters and for presenting a compelling family life for the Bergstrom kids,`` even though the show has a much bigger story (the loss of the parent's job, the father's return to school, etc.) the relationship between the two main characters is what we care about the most at the end of the episode. `` The two storylines intertwine perfectly: the father trying to convince the kids to come home, and the kids wondering about their father. The characters are also very, very well written by a bunch of people you're sure are terrifically talented, but somehow I didn't care a little bit about their futures or what was supposed to happen to them. It didn't matter. No one's lives matter, we all love those stories, and everyone will get a happy ending, so just let it go. `` All in all, it was a good, if slightly disappointing, hour of television. `` If you want to watch a good comedy on ABC, watch ``The Love Boat.''","token_len":452,"entropy":[10.0169,7.3258,0.3807,0.9488,10.5584,9.5436,5.8503,5.5532,0.7883,1.5214,2.3915,1.2136,5.8564,1.3856,7.7678,5.926,6.8638,3.4251,0.3198,2.895,0.7871,5.5267,0.9449,6.9349,1.6792,11.9057,14.4323,5.8697,7.786,6.6953,8.8238,3.5024,4.545,2.7129,6.7811,5.5423,1.9114,1.4772,4.9481,4.1311,2.4711,0.0002,4.272,1.0601,5.1891,4.3045,1.3521,5.6706,1.2302,0.3886,2.7918,4.3237,5.3594,1.1812,7.7562,0.9276,3.6773,0.6748,1.4057,1.2245,2.433,3.7337,2.9125,1.7768,5.7612,2.5692,1.2228,3.4714,0.3736,0.4375,2.278,2.265,1.297,1.6799,1.7771,0.7128,0.1778,0.2858,3.9485,2.8652,0.6824,0.0662,0.0098,0.0082,0.0113,0.0019,0.0021,0.0022,0.0017,0.0014,0.0007,0.0019,0.0009,0.003,0.0008,0.001,0.0015,0.0008,0.0015,0.0012,0.0001,1.6417,0.2449,5.5971,1.1189,5.4894,1.1058,3.1505,0.7851,0.8724,0.7424,0.0506,0.0039,3.0784,4.384,0.0065,5.2591,1.7181,0.4615,0.0615,3.4734,0.1667,5.4027,0.4692,1.1607,2.7792,0.0224,5.555,0.8567,3.1988,0.63,1.4327,0.7062,0.8987,4.6201,0.0193,0.1426,1.0102,1.2192,0.2025,1.8511,5.1909,4.5913,4.5336,1.0154,3.306,6.1873,1.6152,3.2716,4.0581,4.4115,1.8023,5.0756,5.9055,1.8106,5.412,3.5978,2.7568,3.6969,3.2854,0.0105,5.3194,1.2487,0.9551,1.253,5.2582,0.3706,1.1289,1.5936,4.4422,1.5879,1.1777,1.1854,5.6933,1.9719,0.0031,2.0447,0.0205,0.5615,3.8655,1.3752,0.7525,1.1239,5.3008,4.8414,0.6983,1.279,1.2266,0.2765,0.8776,1.1694,4.5111,3.439,6.0906,3.7068,2.2234,2.694,2.5355,2.9504,3.7989,0.2598,0.0706,3.6309,0.4171,3.6991,3.227,4.5031,2.0082,0.6685,3.1875,4.2577,1.6064,0.9646,3.7904,4.3671,7.0903,1.56,0.0018,0.3728,6.1316,0.6492,3.3813,1.6399,0.0738,0.0981,2.4747,1.6086,3.948,3.6417,0.0301,3.2698,0.0527,1.5096,4.1826,0.0598,3.3572,2.0927,2.8891,2.6992,4.3299,4.2842,3.5279,1.6375,3.2417,1.7561,0.629,3.8365,0.3218,1.6078,1.3198,2.7789,0.0906,2.2943,0.6803,5.4908,1.1637,4.9397,5.8807,3.9274,3.3128,1.1617,2.604,0.0968,3.4978,1.7434,6.1099,4.1501,0.5346,1.4043,2.1933,3.8351,1.6435,4.0333,3.1886,2.9897,6.4805,2.2533,5.4341,0.0128,1.8403,5.9528,1.491,1.0146,2.8101,0.9823,3.4215,0.0853,4.1576,0.3779,2.9768,0.9102,1.6996,0.3969,5.3961,4.5961,0.5171,0.9038,0.7589,0.9142,0.0166,1.4358,3.3787,4.3929,3.1463,0.04,2.5641,0.014,4.9604,0.2814,0.2665,0.3311,0.1741,1.5106,0.2305,0.3729,1.7388,4.327,5.1576,5.1471,0.0033,5.1261,3.8333,1.6092,3.0512,5.8166,0.0411,5.3938,1.3872,1.5938,0.8177,3.2678,0.9306,1.4118,1.4078,0.3828,0.9227,5.1287,3.3293,0.8372,0.751,1.1895,1.6128,3.941,0.9492,3.8826,2.5801,5.4791,0.0208,1.6925,2.2861,5.4814,3.7174,4.4441,0.0073,3.3273,5.5345,3.9203,2.0468,1.6265,4.1469,4.3626,0.5686,1.487,2.5504,5.9857,3.9531,2.853,0.0023,1.5154,5.5254,4.4974,0.1118,0.5081,3.2462,6.1016,3.1174,2.1448,2.0541,6.088,0.0035,0.069,0.3693,0.0549,0.5586,2.3711,4.0589,0.0009,1.6359,2.0606,6.5354,1.0262,3.0591,4.1522,3.1355,1.969,5.1572,2.6828,5.2822,5.0931,3.458,0.9187,0.8742,4.9516,3.9085,2.3515,2.0906,0.7485,0.0632,1.6963,2.0398,4.1969,2.3222,0.6991,0.3331,0.6447,1.4329,5.1404,0.572,0.01,0.0853,2.414,0.7614,0.4185,1.8238,2.4002,3.1791,2.793,2.5155,0.2867,3.4324,0.3551,0.082,0.5744,1.3051,4.5312,0.6898,2.9552,0.5451,2.036,1.018,1.9235,3.5067,3.007,4.2181,0.5708,3.6024,0.7942,3.9023,3.9204,0.0352,1.3113]}

These hazards account for any natural or human-made event that impinges on, damages, or threatens the integrity of lands within the national forest.","token_len":452,"entropy":[6.5789,6.7749,1.8792,4.7976,3.1642,3.4169,2.2485,1.1696,0.0381,4.7937,5.1063,5.1298,0.0043,10.711,0.0228,0.0219,1.5037,0.0194,1.9243,2.2275,6.0182,2.9109,3.0361,16.4561,6.7092,8.3123,11.3847,5.6333,0.4307,1.3442,7.3367,6.6406,3.3686,10.1233,3.9065,0.4205,0.9002,4.292,0.878,0.2055,0.4039,3.7672,0.129,0.4332,0.316,4.5492,0.0959,0.5558,0.1864,4.4012,0.3209,0.4715,0.1705,5.7538,0.087,4.3169,2.1578,0.7351,3.3622,1.4162,6.5292,3.7332,1.4289,3.9652,2.5079,1.4369,1.7445,2.501,2.2151,2.9918,0.1485,0.1915,0.0354,5.4131,0.0823,0.1386,7.8913,0.0182,4.9997,0.5434,0.882,3.8153,0.0183,0.9212,1.2638,1.2983,2.0959,0.0123,3.1263,0.7873,3.5412,2.2631,3.1751,3.1683,0.4417,1.0318,0.7037,4.5244,4.3246,4.8617,2.0892,1.8674,0.0214,4.1665,1.092,2.4994,5.1697,1.5372,3.9297,2.2587,6.306,4.2114,0.303,0.4615,2.9816,1.5992,0.0059,1.8938,1.8772,1.9897,1.0305,2.3002,2.6599,1.7027,1.0157,0.8721,5.0462,2.0183,5.4816,0.0367,0.1108,1.3676,0.6432,0.02,0.2703,0.9967,4.4282,2.431,0.5566,0.6667,0.4596,0.1312,5.2757,0.0407,0.0003,0.0018,0.0957,0.0065,0.1245,0.9308,4.1232,0.5735,5.6108,2.8824,0.3335,2.8328,1.5329,1.7692,2.9459,0.7678,4.9971,1.0638,1.7006,0.1346,1.9532,0.8208,0.0072,4.1148,0.9211,0.1292,0.3578,1.0075,1.8022,1.8734,0.8457,1.0768,1.3667,0.0069,2.5009,4.5202,4.083,4.3333,4.6471,2.2652,0.2014,3.1288,1.4197,0.0007,0.0002,0.081,0.9663,3.3126,4.8762,0.2647,0.9383,0.0002,5.3922,5.6648,0.1238,2.1691,5.3033,2.6363,5.4081,3.4738,0.0003,2.5655,2.9718,0.7944,0.6574,0.2864,2.1072,3.0031,0.5161,0.0648,2.6249,0.0002,0.0446,0.0072,0.2368,0.7448,1.63,0.0002,2.3045,2.7518,0.2184,3.9487,1.1072,0.9765,1.4763,0.0003,3.5174,3.7731,1.2491,0.2024,1.4769,1.9147,0.0002,5.581,3.1846,0.9866,0.6225,1.8992,0.6678,0.0002,4.0515,0.005,0.2561,0.0175,5.2411,1.3523,2.6248,0.5597,0.0002,3.0138,0.8526,3.4746,3.8085,1.0634,4.0007,2.1852,5.128,6.6959,5.6703,0.0296,1.7731,1.1297,0.3513,3.8518,0.3854,0.0751,0.0054,0.4694,2.321,2.8928,0.8119,4.0002,4.1829,0.5177,1.8022,0.2855,3.4869,5.5408,0.7436,4.606,1.1032,0.598,0.0033,0.0215,3.7628,2.2412,0.9706,6.1406,2.7973,5.3229,0.6246,0.3422,4.2101,3.636,0.1618,1.9354,1.4634,0.0121,6.8484,0.7338,2.4524,0.0003,6.1792,2.0581,5.9147,1.7573,1.555,0.4294,0.0695,3.6979,1.473,5.4175,1.2893,7.2505,0.0598,0.0078,2.8088,0.464,0.4309,6.0434,2.2995,0.0703,3.2579,2.7271,0.9394,0.0589,2.7729,5.5699,3.027,1.6556,1.2383,0.4874,0.266,1.3978,1.5089,0.4181,0.0002,4.974,0.0767,0.0006,0.0732,0.0147,5.1911,1.0623,0.8689,0.0149,6.3522,4.2124,2.061,0.1393,1.0283,0.0002,2.9229,5.7769,2.9881,2.7615,0.7452,0.3279,0.2976,4.0307,2.4756,0.8801,0.2778,4.6793,0.0056,11.0553,0.043,4.1524,0.0034,3.3775,0.2995,0.4779,2.5808,2.8555,0.6177,3.9203,1.2762,1.75,4.3687,2.7592,0.9136,2.5239,3.5842,0.4153,0.0002,5.9478,1.0162,4.8588,2.6663,4.2937,6.4446,0.0855,0.0002,1.1767,0.0002,1.9612,3.6425,2.9618,1.757,2.8133,2.3452,0.8487,0.6272,1.5995,0.2461,4.8845,3.8987,0.068,6.2308,2.2152,4.839,0.7779,3.7146,2.1143,0.4545,0.5119,1.0988,0.9386,2.8812,0.9225,7.0768,0.009,5.5309,1.5915,0.7041,1.4352,0.3834,0.7636,4.0277,0.2638,6.5109,2.5486,0.2241,3.7295,2.0307,0.138,0.4971,2.8369,0.7418,1.988,0.3911,3.6337,3.077,0.3592,0.997,0.5028,0.4542]}
{"id":2105,"ended":true,"length":373,"gen_text":"San hunter and gatherers, ancestors of the < unk > peoples, were the first known inhabitants of the region that is now Mozambique, followed in the 1st and 4th centuries by Bantu speakers and finally by Khoisan. The first group of Bantu speakers to arrive in east Africa were known as the Kambas, who were the original inhabitants of the territory now called Kenya. When the first Khoisan arrived in south-eastern Africa, they crossed the region and became the Afar sub-ethnic group and the main settlement population of south-east Asia and northern Africa, respectively. As these groups spread out into the region of southern Africa (e.g. Angola ), they became known as Kaffirs and eventually as black Africans. In southern Africa, the term Afrikaans may have originated because the Kaffirs found the language difficult to learn in the south and so changed it to Afrikaans ( Afrikaans ). By the 17th century it acquired the meaning 'black' and, as there is evidence of Kaffir slaves arriving in Britain from about 1600 during the Black Death plague, it has acquired a racial meaning in Britain, as well. In modern times, the term Afrikaner has been used to refer to a person (usually an Afrikaans-speaking one) from one of the Germanic tribes, which includes (among others) the Afrikaans speakers of the Cape, Limpopo, Zulu and Swazi. This is the traditional usage; today the term is used more loosely to refer to a person with German ancestry, and occasionally an English-speaker, regardless of their German-speaking identity. Afrikaners also sometimes refer to themselves as Afrikaans-English speakers. This is also the original usage. It refers to persons with an Afrikaans-speaking ancestry in their ancestry who may or may not speak English. The term is generally applied less often to persons who have German ancestry in their ancestry, but who (1) speak German or other Germanic languages (2) are not related to Afrikaners as their ancestors came from Germany, or (3) are Afrikaner-English speakers.","token_len":452,"entropy":[15.3315,3.8636,5.6572,0.9564,3.3945,0.2621,2.2105,9.1966,0.1748,0.8729,10.288,11.3816,2.1541,1.7991,4.8702,1.3256,2.3227,2.7232,1.1519,4.5669,1.8929,0.0402,0.7837,2.9231,3.9169,1.1507,0.182,10.5002,0.0048,0.0028,1.4647,6.946,3.1623,1.5277,5.6289,0.4292,3.7477,5.12,0.0098,0.2895,0.3114,6.0417,0.0414,0.0944,2.4279,2.0031,2.7784,0.5843,5.3194,0.1994,0.0354,1.8547,1.6422,2.9154,5.4697,0.9868,3.008,0.0048,0.0549,0.319,3.2421,1.5103,0.4273,6.0103,0.45,1.2804,3.8478,0.1488,0.5311,3.7983,2.0651,2.5604,1.0175,1.4112,1.7429,2.4773,3.3954,0.4537,0.0302,0.9285,5.6734,2.0391,2.1501,3.773,0.65,5.0512,0.5574,3.191,2.7499,0.0187,0.0197,1.096,0.4491,3.569,0.3921,0.9208,0.001,0.1789,0.9091,0.4633,5.6116,0.3098,3.9326,3.5851,2.7145,0.9432,5.8925,0.3514,7.1498,0.2714,5.6787,0.2104,4.0936,1.0856,4.7738,5.8427,2.6806,0.9925,3.2317,0.0542,0.9635,3.5205,2.8185,3.5843,0.6612,2.1174,2.5415,0.1226,4.6457,4.1233,1.6047,1.8469,1.9937,2.4335,1.0607,2.1234,2.5559,3.1695,0.1614,4.0872,3.3702,0.6451,0.0052,0.2469,1.1035,8.6552,0.7883,2.819,0.8307,0.0981,4.9273,0.2207,0.0972,2.1108,2.5844,1.2529,2.6203,0.1742,0.413,3.1146,3.2396,0.0768,0.3678,0.8113,3.248,2.7687,1.1636,0.0296,5.8896,1.5975,2.7889,3.4389,1.0622,2.0562,0.0198,0.136,5.9995,2.2564,2.0378,2.1314,0.0955,1.7589,4.0076,1.0289,3.714,2.6082,2.2892,3.8776,0.4719,0.4406,0.2485,0.0119,0.0049,3.0716,4.337,0.0276,0.0101,2.422,4.2226,0.3497,3.4373,0.0266,0.0794,4.0847,6.9539,0.9273,1.4346,1.0825,1.6678,1.0857,1.7164,4.0473,2.3126,5.6348,2.1132,2.4814,0.8358,2.9858,0.0101,0.6188,2.7665,3.3213,0.2202,4.2773,2.0854,5.1367,3.0287,7.4108,0.1141,3.2122,0.1675,3.8998,0.2677,1.0441,2.2031,1.9306,1.5566,2.95,2.3816,2.7828,2.4323,2.7545,2.7952,1.2614,0.6929,2.7013,3.3555,0.8097,0.4652,1.0568,0.6573,0.9899,1.3323,0.022,0.0285,0.7632,1.0068,0.5564,0.5861,0.7473,0.0725,2.1507,0.7601,5.6514,1.3798,2.6723,0.4094,1.4789,0.1389,0.7723,0.462,3.1007,0.0538,1.7442,4.9993,0.0758,0.135,3.5695,0.3763,2.256,2.9739,3.2868,2.1358,5.6142,2.654,0.2145,0.0811,0.1913,2.5968,0.2378,0.0199,3.4328,0.9893,1.3023,1.5298,2.0796,3.7482,0.0673,0.0,0.7683,3.1672,0.5443,0.9728,1.2715,0.4532,1.6929,2.9341,1.8314,2.5913,4.9611,1.8743,4.0161,3.8367,1.8052,0.3545,1.0588,1.6325,2.6056,2.7565,0.6878,0.5864,0.0482,2.2494,0.491,2.3501,1.6683,2.2666,1.7164,3.0455,5.2492,3.8996,2.4669,0.8003,1.8087,0.0023,2.1818,2.8318,0.0056,1.2425,2.0897,4.0727,1.1876,4.7969,0.2143,3.21,0.5634,0.028,0.6929,3.9184,3.1852,0.6829,0.033,0.1623,0.2763,2.3096,2.5481,0.0784,0.1799,2.1476,1.0011,1.2392,3.3612,1.3319,2.7365,0.8332,4.9575,0.2465,1.2932,3.8673,5.0145,0.175,4.7607,1.6564,3.1911,0.7164,0.0664,0.0112,0.6997,0.3656,2.8823,2.3914,3.9331,2.1943,1.1576,3.253,1.4345,0.0059,0.0045,1.8986,0.0826,1.0032,2.0074,0.762,2.1927,3.8172,3.7461,5.2718,1.8863,0.2606,1.9105,1.7658,1.6348,1.6747,0.687,1.3018,0.1117,0.0987,1.4276,1.6132,1.5161,5.8662,5.1281,0.0031,1.3141,2.1659,2.3276,3.7331,0.7418,0.1759,0.0514,2.3688,3.3436,0.0022,1.3921,1.4957,4.8439,0.1081,1.2566,0.5345,0.0164,0.076,3.0181,3.1349,1.0515,2.1033,0.3515,2.4085,1.3598,2.1371,0.1161,0.0031,0.0016,1.31,2.7499,0.1225,0.0053,1.3129,1.5481,0.1743,0.0341,0.6197]}
{"id":1921,"ended":true,"length":396,"gen_text":"Since Islais Creek is a culvert that carries storm water, domestic sewage, and industrial wastewater, it is possible for the sewage to overflow. Such overflow can cause a public health hazard if it enters the home in the driveway or walkway, into the home through a front door, or seep into the home through an open window.\n\nAn overflow in the backyard of a home can also result in an overflow that is unsafe for pets or children to enter. During a sewer overflows, a discharge typically occurs in a backyard and may have significant impact on human health and safety. The health effects of these overflows are unpredictable. The health effects from sewer overflows can include:\n\nPersistent diarrhea\n\nInfant mortality due to diarrhea\n\nInfant deaths\n\nChildren born with severe or long-term illnesses such as ear, nose, and throat infections\n\nLymph nodes may show signs of irritation\n\nSeizures, especially in children, can occur\n\nElevated levels of ammonia and nitrite in household and residential tap water\n\nIf a home has problems with sewer overflows, make sure to regularly monitor for any change in color of the water. You should also try to reduce or eliminate any sewer overflows in your home (through improvements, improvements to your property, or by implementing treatment methods).\n\nIf you suspect your household is having sewer overflows affecting your water, contact your local health department. You can find this information at your local health department's website.\n\nWashing Your Hands\n\nWhen washing your hands as you normally would after you eat and prior to drinking, you should wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm running water (about 100 degrees F, 15-20 degrees C) for at least 20 seconds, as this will help keep germs at bay while you wash your hands.\n\nWhen Your Car Leads to a Sewer Overflow\n\nIf your car leads to a sewage overflow that is unsafe for your family to enter, contact the local health department. There may be resources available to help you with the cleanup of the overflow, as well as any possible impacts on your personal health, including any health risks from waterborne outbreaks caused by the overflow.","token_len":453,"entropy":[10.3136,1.742,5.6384,10.5686,1.6494,1.6524,6.632,0.419,2.6903,3.6804,2.6206,1.0372,2.2589,10.7956,1.1809,0.8779,0.5511,2.49,2.267,0.9482,1.6972,0.9794,3.9878,1.5278,2.056,3.4426,0.3973,4.0188,3.0352,5.9277,1.8517,1.902,1.5004,2.6079,3.3597,0.1495,1.1355,2.7888,1.0698,2.043,0.9979,5.4429,5.7092,1.8595,5.7056,1.0803,5.3436,0.1943,1.764,3.7349,0.8717,1.5406,1.8534,1.3921,6.1821,0.4963,0.4041,0.1522,4.9307,1.8608,0.501,0.4925,0.9198,0.3995,2.2427,0.9556,0.3528,0.6423,0.9716,0.0007,5.5015,1.446,3.3312,0.8122,2.8404,1.624,0.4659,0.9356,1.5841,1.5904,2.8693,0.0508,2.6601,1.6029,3.3111,2.7616,4.4513,0.4163,3.7067,1.7161,0.8657,1.0944,0.7026,0.4321,6.3253,1.5981,3.3436,3.6934,0.0877,0.3232,3.1211,5.6917,6.2281,1.0103,1.5007,1.8706,4.4902,3.6505,2.7632,3.765,3.9955,2.0722,0.4405,4.1772,0.132,1.1119,1.7191,0.2683,3.0812,3.8896,2.0071,0.5187,4.0428,0.7842,0.0015,1.3607,4.9062,1.4838,2.699,2.6825,0.6713,3.3105,1.7929,0.1383,0.0007,1.7096,0.8832,1.3685,0.2742,0.0003,5.6021,0.1353,1.8918,0.5619,0.0002,4.1976,1.3498,1.6436,3.4572,0.0017,0.4843,0.2643,0.0002,2.9476,0.0978,1.7604,1.7239,0.0002,4.9324,3.9124,0.3025,2.5943,3.6378,4.4098,0.2929,0.3534,3.8076,3.5056,0.0027,4.618,2.5592,1.0358,0.1542,0.321,0.0922,0.2354,0.8282,0.0002,4.1166,3.7226,2.514,2.6257,5.9843,1.1345,0.0396,3.4374,1.2471,0.0002,4.8491,2.9655,0.0514,2.7681,3.1543,0.5196,1.2385,2.8684,1.4371,0.5422,0.4367,0.0002,5.0003,0.973,0.036,2.2064,0.0099,1.4342,1.5109,1.6295,1.1687,1.5114,3.6895,2.7761,2.4131,2.0386,0.0236,0.8624,0.0002,3.881,1.9878,2.2785,1.4414,6.1803,0.2554,1.1029,0.2942,0.0003,0.248,5.5192,0.1896,1.3677,4.7904,2.4146,2.1979,3.215,4.8124,0.1743,5.9853,1.8902,0.3619,0.1962,0.8632,3.98,1.6046,0.4925,4.9709,0.1354,3.4462,2.6337,0.4772,2.2128,5.2117,0.9774,0.0023,1.5423,0.4599,1.1913,6.2262,5.2783,5.3377,1.8435,4.6374,0.4701,1.0369,2.2852,0.1297,0.3561,2.0214,4.5909,4.8707,2.2661,1.1258,0.7229,0.0003,2.0426,0.8205,1.8406,2.8585,4.022,2.1102,1.1419,1.5172,0.3108,0.0002,6.8999,0.5305,2.0946,0.5613,1.6163,0.5562,0.5142,1.006,0.0789,1.1651,2.303,0.6366,2.2404,4.8772,0.2524,1.4031,1.732,0.2174,0.5396,0.0182,0.8531,0.2379,0.431,0.6182,0.0002,5.0693,3.4927,1.7128,0.4055,0.9158,0.0003,3.1847,1.4831,0.2096,0.0019,6.7964,0.9315,2.3922,0.145,3.4453,4.2075,1.6729,2.5226,5.5574,0.0017,4.6023,0.3371,1.6043,0.7286,1.4872,0.2184,0.0078,2.1388,0.9978,0.1477,0.0951,1.2218,4.5575,0.005,3.3763,3.0938,0.8632,0.6351,0.7447,3.3684,5.4919,2.5343,0.3807,1.4705,0.0783,1.1037,1.5522,0.6493,0.0008,0.3676,0.0362,2.2086,4.0754,1.6947,1.0531,1.3931,4.3773,1.5647,0.0001,2.029,0.0188,3.9428,0.5637,2.0473,0.4541,0.0038,0.1271,1.2252,0.0003,3.1751,6.5444,4.315,4.0908,1.1361,0.3213,1.4263,0.1333,0.5127,0.6549,0.0038,0.0742,0.0002,1.0219,0.8189,0.2999,0.6396,0.268,0.3345,1.8288,0.1053,3.5691,1.604,1.8346,0.1915,1.2888,1.1631,0.7505,0.2525,0.3686,2.5349,1.4753,0.7913,0.58,0.0163,0.9746,4.1085,1.4698,0.0751,3.5558,0.7086,0.5917,0.521,0.4026,2.3397,1.638,1.6808,1.4412,0.713,1.2162,2.1421,3.1834,0.2178,0.0811,3.4971,4.0107,4.6414,0.7572,0.2873,4.2902,0.2051,3.4635,2.0032,3.9504,2.6146,2.5654,1.9243,4.1592,2.6247,6.5506,3.5367,0.0197,1.7672,1.0914,0.1217]}
{"id":142,"ended":true,"length":404,"gen_text":"Sholay was released on 15 August 1975, Indian Independence Day, in Mumbai. Due to lacklustre reviews and a lack of effective visual marketing tools, it saw poor financial returns in its launch year and sales in its first year were not encouraging either. The film made a loss because of its lower earnings per ticket than expected, although it has managed to gather a lot of buzz since its release. The film is also one of the biggest box office disasters of all time.\n\nDespite the immense failures and public opinion against it, the film continued to be screened at multiplexes and it became popular again in the new millennium, after being released in 2000 with the added scenes of the song Maram. The film also made a comeback in Hindi cinema with the film Raja Rani Aagaan which was followed by more remakes. The song \"Jaam Jambhoom Rake Khichidiye\" remained the biggest selling single after Maram, during the decade, and got several releases on Bollywood music charts, and even gained a following in the States.\n\nHowever, some of the key elements of popular Hindu mythology found in the film were toned down and the song was given a new twist. The song was released as \"Khichidiye\" (The Song) during the film's release in 2001 and the soundtrack album, Khichidiye (The Song album), became the best selling album in India, despite the fact that it was not an official release from the studio.\n\nThe film had a few sequels in Hindi film, besides that the series continued in the form of TV serials, comic books and novels. The song and its characters were referenced several times in other films after its release and a sequel by the same name was also produced and released in India. On 14 January 2017, the song featuring the voices of Piyush Mishra and Amitabh Bachchan is the first song released on YouTube. On 14 March 2017, the movie Razaa (2017) was released. The song was included in the OST and released on 18 March, 2017.\n\nThe song was also included in the OST of Bhaga Mastani (2016) and Dangal (2016).","token_len":453,"entropy":[6.7497,4.5454,3.7628,2.1355,1.97,4.6481,2.1835,4.8615,1.226,8.5128,4.9137,1.4191,1.2151,2.4349,5.7615,0.7096,7.5801,0.0122,5.2591,6.1517,0.0004,2.5508,1.6963,2.0257,2.5474,0.0276,9.8359,8.9529,2.6142,6.7084,0.2603,1.5609,6.0794,4.2552,6.4707,0.1389,3.2126,1.7979,6.1372,2.0661,2.0469,5.5762,4.1809,1.4825,2.002,1.354,1.307,3.0181,4.4156,1.9755,0.1207,1.9851,0.5922,3.8688,1.5052,3.9324,8.3038,0.5105,1.5467,5.7888,5.4527,2.8632,1.4612,0.9198,4.5676,1.7277,4.6695,0.9275,3.5546,3.1945,0.0335,5.6358,1.1862,3.7354,0.0167,4.4829,2.7811,1.0491,0.4161,0.3518,2.2501,0.7086,2.3987,2.3825,2.987,0.0127,0.0885,2.9103,1.9466,0.1251,5.3897,1.2549,0.3846,0.1551,1.0354,0.7736,0.0108,5.0726,1.2072,5.7561,4.9231,2.8779,6.2428,3.9034,0.9435,0.9756,0.0715,1.282,0.4206,4.0283,0.0677,1.139,2.873,2.8598,3.428,0.0191,1.8852,3.7154,3.216,3.5482,4.4873,1.2169,0.5838,6.5556,0.1588,2.4209,3.8781,2.0684,2.2299,1.1105,2.8264,3.7737,1.9991,5.326,5.7849,1.0186,1.6932,3.7619,6.194,4.6448,2.4692,1.7519,0.7379,3.0411,2.5862,0.8894,0.648,0.4671,4.7611,1.0512,1.108,1.2584,3.7947,5.0163,1.088,2.4019,0.6995,6.3109,4.3914,2.4469,3.6468,0.7793,5.3135,0.1213,4.3221,3.6263,0.0033,1.8734,2.0067,4.284,2.3079,5.3284,4.8679,5.1605,4.3313,2.274,1.1087,6.0812,5.7803,5.0308,4.5005,6.1367,2.4214,0.4448,6.3943,1.625,2.4898,0.9422,1.2626,4.9457,3.0041,0.1079,2.2507,6.0173,0.6892,2.5999,3.0141,1.2891,6.1596,4.2545,5.3823,1.8284,3.2504,0.0099,1.6861,0.6536,2.4439,3.4905,2.3735,5.6329,1.3588,4.4327,0.9559,1.0499,3.5269,0.6215,0.6421,0.0002,4.1948,0.063,5.9307,1.3445,0.1782,5.1258,3.1849,0.7086,6.9538,6.6341,2.5316,5.4584,0.6969,0.4664,0.3694,1.4293,4.9157,0.0112,0.0192,1.9911,1.7025,3.2723,1.9853,3.8666,0.5696,1.6323,2.3573,1.1758,1.2679,2.1762,1.3943,3.8325,1.4766,1.5316,3.8407,0.1624,1.1454,0.0224,0.8761,2.36,2.572,3.7792,1.736,4.0958,0.307,2.9705,0.2711,2.1486,1.083,2.4755,1.572,2.4198,5.1893,1.2335,2.7123,2.487,0.0137,0.2005,0.0088,2.5737,0.6147,0.1755,6.7848,0.7432,4.4518,1.4669,2.3375,0.2645,1.0412,1.4017,0.9114,3.0759,3.7989,1.3313,1.1072,0.0794,0.8239,0.8759,1.7971,3.9179,0.7357,0.5135,2.7041,0.3382,2.4362,0.2954,1.0641,0.0002,1.5718,1.256,3.7837,1.5188,4.1475,2.2847,2.4789,2.0177,3.1119,3.8579,6.1636,5.844,2.4687,5.1398,3.5077,1.2522,1.9068,1.4411,0.0046,3.0606,1.5678,0.0055,1.4293,4.9052,0.2593,0.6357,3.0839,0.2922,1.4334,3.3833,4.4712,2.0084,3.9444,1.6587,5.1547,4.7726,0.0239,0.266,2.5044,1.032,5.3506,1.4032,0.2719,2.1851,3.9387,3.6224,5.8966,0.5348,0.0907,0.671,0.4896,2.1256,3.6622,3.2382,0.1825,0.3894,2.8467,0.7157,6.0961,3.8912,2.7341,3.2698,0.0865,1.2227,1.8357,6.3128,2.0467,5.2741,0.0088,5.0447,2.3946,0.0052,0.7531,0.0,0.6764,3.3043,0.0033,0.0013,0.0183,0.0023,4.6575,2.9532,2.5161,1.6147,3.1887,1.1774,2.074,1.7528,4.3578,3.2924,2.2548,0.189,0.0747,0.8634,3.0893,4.5284,4.8083,1.2948,3.5013,3.4137,0.1741,0.9478,0.1115,1.7846,1.5547,0.4958,1.6834,3.623,0.2365,0.1789,6.3512,0.1708,2.5381,3.4001,0.4855,4.374,1.1417,4.1173,0.4643,0.1888,0.8307,0.0002,1.6192,0.7221,1.5635,1.1687,2.224,0.0747,0.4261,3.3149,0.0102,1.734,5.829,5.1579,6.9484,0.7474,0.823,1.8027,0.8463,0.6857,4.3273,0.6093,0.0013,0.0489,0.5785,0.5375]}
{"id":4399,"ended":true,"length":441,"gen_text":"The song was generally well received by music critics. In a review of the group's debut album Spice, Dev Sherlock of Yahoo! Music Radio called it a `` glossy ballad that evokes a summery feel for the band's first single.'' The group performed the song in concert in September 2003. Dev concluded the review by saying the song, ``is as catchy as it is hard-working.'' The song was #17 on iTunes' Alternative chart of singles produced after January 2003. The song also charted in the US on Billboard's Hot 100 chart for three weeks. The song has also been the focus of music videos for The Weeknd and Daft Punk. The Weeknd's \"Can't Feel My Face\" is #2 on Billboard's Social 50 list, the song's video is #13 on YouTube's Dance Channel's \"100 Most Viewed Videos\" list, and the song was played in the final three songs on the MTV Video Music Awards 2004, including the winner, \"I Know Places.\" However, there has been some controversy surrounding the song. Some have alleged some of the verses have been altered in a way that the original artists don't appear. According to The Weeknd, some of the lyrics of the song are similar to his own lyrics (including \"in a world where you've got to give up\"), and he has also said the verse on the album has been changed so that he would have to put his hand over his heart when saying God Bless. The Weeknd further explained that the verse on the album in which he put his hand over his heart is from New Orleans R&B singer Beyonce's song \"The Love Club.\" However, when the verses were first released, the original lyrics for \"The Hills\" had not included this phrase, as noted by Dev Sherlock on YY! Music Radio. It is possible the verse was written before Beyonce's song was released, or may have been written for a different song altogether. On the April 6, 2016 episode of CBS' Late Show with David Letterman, comedian James Corden referred to the song as a song written for people who could be ``sexually impotent'', stating that he felt sorry for the song's author considering how sexual it is.","token_len":454,"entropy":[8.0388,2.4333,8.6519,1.4986,0.4201,1.5205,5.083,0.4873,1.8526,2.8309,1.8996,0.9535,1.1682,0.5741,6.3044,0.0722,3.0315,0.372,12.3311,1.5177,10.5732,16.5216,0.9922,8.5499,1.1226,0.2986,7.6877,1.9082,0.9733,2.303,10.0355,15.6502,4.2186,0.0849,2.6315,5.5606,0.06,1.7279,5.2254,2.8991,3.269,4.1865,1.1679,4.5215,0.8547,3.1137,3.7346,0.7074,2.0399,4.9459,4.785,0.8483,0.1245,2.0359,1.5671,1.8046,3.5655,4.4183,0.9658,6.2601,5.2393,1.5234,0.2927,0.5786,1.0842,2.7083,0.5035,4.4677,0.829,2.2457,4.0935,2.8679,0.2082,0.9983,0.0863,5.38,0.8201,2.7692,0.7519,2.2352,1.6238,1.1745,3.9452,4.6295,0.0335,5.7608,0.1463,2.985,3.163,4.8171,5.7205,6.2955,5.6041,3.1893,3.5458,0.4068,2.056,0.8962,3.0563,2.1155,0.0003,1.3963,0.7518,2.9258,2.483,1.3151,0.1445,1.2379,0.7092,1.848,2.4229,2.3133,0.163,1.4354,1.6497,0.7341,3.5291,1.6533,0.821,4.2213,3.4171,0.0209,4.7698,0.9758,1.7557,5.3483,4.9205,0.001,1.0835,2.5663,0.0137,0.0003,0.3615,1.7827,0.4776,0.0,0.6795,2.2467,1.8233,0.0006,0.0009,0.0017,0.0005,0.1972,2.912,3.5894,2.5247,0.1817,1.6006,0.0262,6.6205,0.1388,3.374,1.5444,3.2699,2.966,2.0725,1.2126,0.855,0.2274,3.8758,0.44,1.9849,0.1033,4.4745,2.2192,3.0487,3.707,5.8171,1.2635,0.4214,0.0004,0.7274,1.2722,1.2546,0.4598,0.144,0.8356,0.8872,1.9796,3.7905,1.7299,1.3608,4.4217,3.6103,4.211,1.673,0.7794,3.958,0.8849,0.0018,0.0189,3.8017,2.7369,2.048,1.3049,1.8482,1.2458,1.4696,2.7337,5.6123,2.3166,0.8778,6.5167,0.0234,4.7511,2.3815,0.1148,1.1916,0.7184,1.1399,0.1367,0.4316,0.8371,2.9538,2.3046,3.7799,8.1601,0.533,0.1162,4.5811,3.6538,1.1834,1.827,2.4613,1.9099,0.646,0.4521,3.545,1.4487,5.5705,4.4501,0.0016,2.8117,1.119,4.594,0.0033,2.6775,1.8783,0.0003,0.3711,3.5196,0.5213,0.1469,1.2127,3.3427,0.4305,0.2851,1.748,4.8617,0.0575,2.0212,0.9172,1.0378,4.7658,3.3806,2.5791,5.6449,1.7614,3.0671,1.4871,1.8978,4.1365,1.2866,0.9568,4.1983,1.1033,3.712,1.5364,1.3477,1.5231,3.1704,1.9306,1.9554,4.3147,3.9236,0.6774,2.7674,2.8078,0.488,1.8838,2.8635,0.7246,1.324,3.3848,2.1866,1.6534,5.6109,1.0812,2.1568,1.2877,0.1352,0.3935,2.3255,3.1335,6.9694,2.7029,0.9576,1.8851,0.9135,0.0003,5.146,3.4243,0.9453,1.1843,1.5921,1.2488,0.3061,0.1943,5.3701,0.6625,0.1582,4.3197,0.0175,0.0748,0.1342,0.0111,0.0074,2.1403,3.3366,7.9161,0.858,4.1763,0.0281,0.0036,0.6992,4.6504,0.6144,0.5287,0.7334,0.3287,4.2328,3.4994,0.7624,0.7999,2.6329,0.0143,3.8117,1.5146,5.7521,0.6124,2.525,0.8486,0.5803,1.4813,2.5034,1.8766,2.9809,1.3461,1.79,3.1035,0.0495,3.4473,3.6999,3.5635,2.7072,2.2577,1.4054,3.8436,4.6944,0.9017,3.8955,0.8149,2.6095,7.2125,5.8705,1.9817,0.1479,0.1202,0.3257,4.295,1.1475,2.363,2.0956,2.5958,1.0474,4.8379,2.9238,1.5446,0.0048,0.2699,0.4329,0.5938,0.207,1.0587,2.0831,4.706,0.2784,0.1338,2.8312,2.5516,2.3611,0.1976,0.9103,1.5695,0.1335,3.3185,2.4064,5.0242,3.4687,0.166,4.5931,0.8764,0.0056,5.1667,0.913,2.9887,0.2359,0.2999,0.8325,0.0001,0.0003,0.0661,5.7667,5.0794,0.1669,0.0001,4.6021,0.0128,0.2606,0.3592,0.3523,1.3667,3.3467,3.2512,1.3482,5.0519,0.5361,5.5819,3.5522,3.549,4.5917,0.3061,5.43,0.0366,6.6168,0.0143,4.499,0.9087,1.9813,4.4211,4.3494,0.0177,0.4694,2.4541,0.821,2.464,6.959,2.3595,5.0147,2.0345,0.9494,0.1624]}
{"id":308,"ended":true,"length":414,"gen_text":"Church teaching on the sixth commandment includes a discussion on chastity. The Catechism describes chastity as a `` moral virtue... a gift from God, a grace, a fruit of spiritual effort and the fruit of that inner need which makes man and woman one flesh.'' (CCC 230.)\n\nChastity is also defined as `` the virtue of self-control.'' (CCC 230.) The Lord Himself commanded St. Paul to make disciples ``of [his] own [own] flesh and blood.'' (Mat. 19:4.) The commandment is not to give up self-control or to do anything that harms one's health or the health of others. There are a variety of reasons for chastity but for the most part, the purpose of chastity is to avoid sin and to do what is right.\n\nPornography shows what is good for those who are motivated by desire. But it also encourages and incites others to evil. The Bible and the Catechism condemn it, and there is no justification for it nor should it be sanctioned or made acceptable by the Church.\n\nWhile there may be some difference in the definition of pornography and other sexual sins, the Church's teaching on sexual morality is consistent. Homosexuality, adultery, fornication, theft, murder, lying, stealing, lying, lust, theft, sodomy, adultery, fornication, theft...all these and other sexual sins fall into two categories and are to be found in the Word of God and the Catechism.\n\nAnd that's as clear as day.\n\nWhat we now have in our hands will only become clearer and more definitive as the Catholic world works with the Holy See and as the faithful in other parts of the world receive access to this treasure of truth and grace at the foot of the Cross.\n\nAll we need is the grace of God to receive these words in an active way.\n\nThe pope is calling on Catholics everywhere to read the Catechism. The pope asks that each and every one read with the spirit of the gospel of Jesus Christ, for we could be forgiven if we continue to follow the way of truth until we arrive at the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ.","token_len":455,"entropy":[8.8056,2.7399,1.3199,9.2176,0.6424,0.0024,5.1879,2.229,4.6738,2.7752,6.2635,0.0279,1.045,1.7335,4.2166,0.0056,0.0052,6.2408,1.0774,0.0012,0.177,2.5913,12.4593,10.161,0.7692,6.3344,2.9712,4.0279,2.0247,0.1181,1.6485,2.73,4.8815,2.946,0.9078,5.2611,0.6498,6.0881,7.4392,1.7847,3.1747,0.7271,0.0306,6.0819,3.5979,4.8822,1.4195,3.1201,2.0567,2.9477,0.0398,3.6253,0.794,0.6375,1.6236,0.1832,4.5967,5.9453,2.4547,0.0192,3.4257,0.0115,0.001,0.6306,2.9831,2.5175,0.441,0.7478,3.0278,2.38,0.5055,1.8693,0.0914,0.2236,3.3085,0.2626,0.0139,0.6538,0.2354,1.7916,6.3433,2.4586,3.7878,3.9405,0.0076,0.2545,0.4603,5.1405,4.2184,1.8857,2.7153,7.8196,0.2327,0.0153,0.0295,5.6222,1.0647,0.0121,0.5389,0.5097,0.6491,1.4432,0.0434,7.1177,0.8757,0.4807,0.01,1.5791,0.4761,2.1691,4.1207,0.4435,2.3512,2.6259,2.0405,5.0687,2.2626,3.5507,0.2949,0.0148,3.2517,1.3727,4.7831,1.012,1.467,4.4631,1.2687,0.0224,2.1929,1.2679,2.7453,0.8321,0.0117,0.6015,0.1976,5.1534,0.8779,3.225,1.7075,0.0025,3.3876,1.3219,1.7399,0.0022,4.2088,4.7345,0.9051,1.0273,0.0253,1.1218,1.9089,3.6945,0.8808,0.2898,0.0007,0.0604,0.357,2.7537,1.8607,1.3292,0.5755,4.3095,1.1541,0.1815,0.5576,0.5242,0.7627,0.0002,5.0742,1.2205,0.0107,6.6401,4.0545,0.9454,3.3664,1.5484,4.8871,0.1748,1.477,6.0437,0.9653,3.2434,1.3322,2.812,1.6534,1.8952,4.8606,3.0379,4.8692,0.0644,1.4763,0.0899,4.9225,0.3892,2.1361,4.1163,5.1744,0.7545,1.1879,0.0043,0.0052,3.3279,2.8748,3.1077,1.358,4.0974,0.6542,0.9936,2.3075,0.1645,0.7511,6.4848,4.1408,1.7164,0.0536,4.5028,2.5501,4.7595,1.3628,1.3772,1.3839,0.4544,0.1304,0.7392,0.0002,5.3476,2.4837,2.9353,0.055,1.3411,5.3625,1.6508,1.2051,3.9141,0.1287,0.8363,1.9232,2.928,1.5509,0.5585,0.2126,1.0225,2.141,2.1573,0.7548,0.8175,2.1604,0.6514,0.7494,1.8184,1.0141,6.0272,0.0014,0.8913,2.0803,1.5374,0.1488,0.8954,0.0005,0.0004,0.1756,6.4072,0.1439,1.9599,0.1425,2.1828,0.0863,2.6247,0.1386,2.1353,0.4972,4.337,0.2701,4.2665,0.0923,4.9709,0.0016,0.1227,2.3835,0.1495,0.6981,0.0067,0.0007,0.0732,3.5418,8.1501,1.7606,1.9149,1.7722,1.0737,1.1837,0.0522,3.9501,1.0343,3.7988,0.9473,4.7079,0.8551,2.9348,0.005,5.8305,0.4083,0.5504,3.4959,0.0442,0.0109,1.5702,0.5088,0.6961,0.0035,0.0088,0.5851,0.8752,0.0002,5.5964,3.9131,1.9098,5.6386,3.4161,0.3189,2.7596,0.3732,1.1287,0.0001,3.6987,4.0367,4.9506,1.4404,2.0886,1.8793,4.362,6.4736,4.4923,4.1285,0.8268,1.823,1.3791,3.2189,0.7879,1.102,4.3044,5.6638,4.6743,3.2585,0.927,2.85,0.4032,1.7329,4.6609,0.7713,3.5255,3.251,2.2996,3.064,0.0049,0.0184,0.0368,4.2233,7.2868,0.0162,1.9902,2.2425,1.5443,3.1089,1.8339,2.3975,6.9509,0.9205,4.3718,0.0466,0.2498,0.6363,0.2774,0.6311,0.0001,4.89,2.9809,2.1937,1.4482,1.4091,2.572,0.4581,1.032,1.2559,3.5102,3.5218,4.0554,3.1846,4.9059,4.4948,2.0102,0.8924,0.9979,0.0001,2.7757,5.8664,2.0876,4.6499,1.6013,1.8842,1.9914,0.0863,3.2674,0.9047,0.356,0.0012,0.0005,2.1399,2.663,2.9557,5.0362,2.2371,3.4359,3.4806,0.0512,0.814,2.4366,5.0944,2.3509,4.4641,0.158,1.1152,3.0219,2.651,0.9664,0.0135,1.6699,4.4882,4.3338,6.8843,2.8782,1.069,2.4079,0.0363,5.017,0.4325,3.5366,0.7786,3.2769,0.0787,2.9887,7.6656,1.091,3.0906,0.0892,0.4947,2.5162,1.1911,1.3064,1.9305,1.7733,0.5777,0.0066,0.274]}

When the silent film The Birth of a Nation premiered in 1915, Du Bois and the NAACP's staff threatened to boycott it for allegedly glorifying the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nThe Birth of a Nation\n\nWhen The Birth of a Nation was released, the NAACP's staff threatened to boycott it, claiming the film glorified racists.\n\nIn his history of the NAACP, Du Bois wrote that before he made the announcement, the group's staff had spent months combing through the films showing at the movie theaters to determine the accuracy of the portrayal of the black community in America. To the shock and consternation of the NAACP's staff, the film, with its explicit depictions of lynching, showed that white society had no problem with lynching. Despite Du Bois's reservations about the film, members unanimously voted to go ahead and distribute it, despite the fact that it contained some inaccuracies.\n\nSoon, there were accusations of racism and the NAACP's staff threatened to boycott some of the films showing during the time period. Du Bois feared this would hurt their reputation, so he met with some of the NAACP's officials and convinced them that the film showed lynching was no longer a problem in the United States.\n\nIt wasn't, which was the first great success of African-American leadership in the country. At the NAACP's national convention in 1912, Du Bois delivered a speech on the state of race relations in the country. He noted that the public viewed American ideals of freedom and self-determination as white and racist.\n\nHis speech was published in the New York Times, which quickly publicized it and made the NAACP a household name.\n\nIt was this speech that helped him gain his place in history, which is where we are today.\n\nIt didn't matter if the speech was intended to inspire or to scare, Du Bois's words carried the weight of over a century. The speech helped pave the path for his legacy, even after he died, as it was widely regarded as one of the top 10 speeches of all time.\n\nIt's one of the best speeches the internet has ever known.","token_len":455,"entropy":[7.817,0.0007,5.7717,2.7886,6.2648,4.0414,0.8443,0.5794,1.685,0.4211,5.1663,4.3026,4.6199,0.0026,2.9556,7.2613,1.9532,4.2676,1.7512,11.5851,0.5287,2.1217,0.3279,0.0077,0.0119,0.0,2.3357,0.6389,0.3985,0.1197,5.793,0.011,0.0002,3.3511,2.2528,0.294,4.0096,4.5212,3.8999,0.5031,1.0749,1.3378,4.0717,3.4355,1.0321,0.0004,0.9716,0.0845,0.0042,0.0007,0.311,2.1328,0.0008,2.4861,2.8225,0.0127,0.03,0.0066,2.5963,0.0002,3.8261,2.5949,0.0053,0.0019,0.0122,0.0016,2.0911,0.7313,1.9652,1.9929,1.1707,2.6452,3.0444,1.3712,0.1213,0.1432,0.5541,2.3933,1.9173,1.8723,0.3837,0.6362,0.0159,7.1237,0.4271,1.4749,0.0002,2.4212,3.1262,5.8814,0.3265,0.2982,0.5882,0.159,1.126,0.0101,0.0003,1.5061,0.9221,5.7849,2.997,4.9472,0.9028,5.0615,0.3386,1.9275,2.6324,1.1999,2.6833,1.3832,4.3463,1.8514,5.0196,0.0007,0.4936,0.6493,5.4584,5.4369,0.7059,1.0418,5.0166,0.8022,2.2417,2.0169,2.8235,5.0296,0.083,0.7352,2.5301,0.0768,1.3546,3.2351,1.1196,1.3992,3.1111,0.1863,5.1408,3.0148,4.9339,2.6332,3.1797,0.0,0.0005,0.0015,0.6847,0.4127,0.7236,0.4099,0.0577,1.0463,1.4123,3.5797,4.5431,0.2361,4.3801,2.34,0.0111,1.3826,0.5758,0.5184,3.731,2.0515,4.0076,2.8774,1.2032,2.8012,1.4619,0.3286,1.4708,0.0978,1.7124,6.2287,3.9691,0.0038,0.0007,0.5899,4.5667,1.4555,0.2758,0.3926,0.2201,6.1005,8.262,1.1188,0.2087,2.7404,0.3495,1.416,2.9355,0.709,2.381,1.9988,0.8907,1.5002,0.0662,1.5777,2.2245,3.83,3.2901,0.0004,0.4103,0.5255,0.0002,5.8733,2.1233,5.2834,0.5139,4.8859,1.1509,1.5927,3.0441,3.2457,0.3926,1.6601,1.1126,0.6083,0.0927,0.1789,7.7745,0.7034,0.3022,2.6376,0.8653,4.0709,0.3335,6.1112,1.5792,1.5724,2.8378,0.0055,0.0006,5.117,2.9532,0.9381,3.0669,2.9846,2.962,1.8582,1.4491,0.1506,4.6856,0.1133,4.1836,0.3522,0.1745,1.2696,0.1703,5.1716,0.9564,3.2127,0.0263,1.4858,1.1305,1.9821,5.0246,3.7434,0.1013,3.1883,4.288,0.706,1.3765,1.0691,0.7286,1.0045,0.6573,0.0007,0.207,0.9033,0.0002,4.5045,2.0318,0.0005,4.3061,5.7344,1.8891,2.6052,3.3361,5.8981,3.292,0.6034,6.4807,0.5347,0.2678,2.4195,0.9193,0.5276,4.3197,0.1743,5.7459,0.5402,2.5479,0.5144,2.2325,0.1365,0.5562,5.0331,0.0378,1.1287,0.0032,0.0002,3.9981,0.6906,0.3847,3.2206,0.7159,4.2658,0.0075,2.2333,0.0139,0.3118,0.5946,1.7661,0.6074,1.1895,3.4484,0.2613,1.7235,5.1784,6.0209,6.2723,6.6418,0.6555,1.8001,0.6022,5.5084,0.0514,0.5286,0.347,4.5671,2.237,4.6403,0.8623,2.1488,0.0002,4.6077,0.415,1.4627,4.4722,0.2945,0.802,3.1325,0.1085,0.5684,1.3865,1.664,4.411,5.4475,1.4652,1.6716,3.0611,2.5885,1.5115,1.4272,0.7465,0.0914,0.2096,1.4245,0.0002,4.4163,0.9198,2.7459,1.0445,0.2794,2.3646,4.1015,2.2079,3.6369,1.9375,0.5592,0.4182,2.1512,3.3225,1.684,3.0581,1.371,1.579,0.5526,0.1332,0.6211,0.0002,4.2155,4.4389,0.0003,1.743,1.9432,1.1049,1.9002,0.3077,5.2095,0.4179,3.5079,1.1347,1.6134,4.3025,1.3007,2.4244,0.0056,0.0003,1.6105,1.2917,4.5434,1.4151,0.8307,0.1013,5.9809,1.0257,0.1988,2.4268,2.6158,1.217,2.8103,4.7526,0.023,3.8878,0.2272,3.6174,2.9902,1.4433,4.6094,3.7699,0.9688,1.2169,2.8936,2.067,1.8495,1.6009,2.9499,4.5921,0.0856,1.5694,0.0104,0.211,5.045,2.0416,0.3732,0.7506,0.5748,0.0318,0.1261,0.2095,0.0002,3.3263,1.2624,4.8846,0.3147,0.3518,2.4377,0.8515,4.7083,6.7526,0.2656,0.3216,3.5025,0.2867]}
{"id":2538,"ended":false,"length":400,"gen_text":"In February 1858, Ives returned to the area in a paddle steamer named Explorer. He was leading an expedition up the Colorado from the south, and he wanted Irataba to guide them down the North Platte in the boat's boat. But Irataba refused to leave because he intended to make another trip into the country and was tired of seeing everyone that he had encountered fail. Ives could not convince Irataba to stay on the river, so he left after just six miles of the trip.\nIt is reported that Ives had a special purpose for escorting Irataba. He intended to build a bridge across the Colorado. On the trip down, Irataba had been drinking; he would need to be intoxicated enough to guide the ship with his knowledge. When Ives returned to the river, he discovered that Irataba had washed up on another rock, and he had left some of his possessions behind. In a moment of madness, Ives picked up some of Irataba's clothes, and found that they were full of antimony. After taking Irataba's clothes, Ives set off on another trip down the river alone in the boat to collect some antimony.\nIt took about one month of carrying his supplies from town to town before Ives arrived where he asked for help. During this time, Irataba returned to his old haunts, and then Ives encountered a \"spirit\" that warned him of a terrible curse on him. Irataba would lose the ability to travel on this world because he could never live as a man again.\nOn February 20, 1859 Irataba died due to drinking poisoned wine. \u00a0It is not clear if Irataba was the sole victim of this curse, or if there were other victims.\nToday there is little trace of his place in history; most people agree Ives didn't even know Irataba's name. The site of his burial is under the riverbed of the Colorado River, about two miles out of Denver where the river meets the Platte River. \u00a0No one knows what has happened to him over the thousands of years since, or how he ended up at this spot.\nIrene Adams","token_len":455,"entropy":[5.477,5.7619,4.0094,0.3456,5.6596,8.2085,4.2362,0.1888,1.8501,4.6937,3.4793,2.8746,6.5525,1.5856,0.001,4.9017,9.3656,1.0273,1.7492,2.215,7.6701,2.8148,0.2112,5.1241,0.159,3.6162,6.2301,1.6644,4.1413,1.4904,1.2106,1.7692,2.4444,12.4039,8.6285,7.9584,0.6812,5.1604,2.5624,3.3539,0.4206,5.9208,0.9321,0.0,4.7125,1.4114,3.1018,2.0784,3.9017,0.7294,3.5238,0.9913,0.0068,0.0019,2.542,1.6586,2.2265,6.0966,0.5917,6.8891,0.0179,4.0522,3.4249,1.2368,3.0494,0.2935,4.3925,2.8568,3.1093,4.5032,0.719,4.9551,5.4637,6.1531,0.9383,1.1563,4.2384,4.2354,0.3879,1.9921,0.0036,4.6726,0.4852,1.7708,0.806,0.0012,0.0004,0.2632,3.493,1.9443,0.5201,1.5525,0.8058,1.1495,0.5515,2.2248,6.1687,3.683,3.6131,3.3112,2.9537,2.9902,0.5042,0.3147,0.9301,8.1637,1.7332,4.863,0.1057,1.977,0.0044,3.5438,1.9106,5.5121,5.7885,0.6261,6.097,0.0051,0.351,0.0062,0.001,2.254,1.3817,3.7321,0.0765,5.9309,0.2965,3.507,0.9468,0.0784,1.0785,2.2386,4.2495,1.0561,2.6094,2.49,1.5556,0.9383,0.0061,0.0007,1.2095,2.4834,4.0844,5.8877,1.0372,3.9331,3.1751,0.8435,0.6385,4.292,3.8535,0.2631,4.1982,0.5029,4.3871,5.7698,0.7306,3.2285,1.8304,3.8532,1.3044,0.0042,1.4001,0.7427,0.5612,1.2597,0.6124,0.7629,3.5738,0.4336,0.405,0.0022,0.0003,0.4376,5.1478,1.167,0.6472,5.921,6.0106,1.7505,1.2805,1.2138,2.1069,4.4288,4.378,0.8838,0.1899,2.6791,0.4517,0.3412,3.9551,2.8441,3.6494,0.0284,3.2303,0.1099,0.448,0.0016,4.7595,0.1049,2.3125,0.2136,0.5259,0.0043,0.0007,0.0023,3.1409,1.3467,1.7506,5.4678,1.0147,1.2652,0.7533,3.0551,0.0076,4.9458,1.1522,0.6516,4.6436,4.0073,2.8859,0.0056,0.0002,0.712,0.7723,1.5411,0.4239,0.0032,3.5725,1.2529,1.7826,3.1417,1.6828,2.027,0.0575,0.5125,5.7843,3.5137,1.2447,0.7483,3.1773,2.5701,1.9623,1.3182,0.0023,0.8166,1.3674,3.7489,3.8533,3.7761,4.5502,1.2738,2.699,4.606,3.6415,3.8727,3.7819,3.2534,0.1351,0.0496,1.578,0.8817,0.0038,4.1775,5.8381,0.6978,6.8946,1.0969,1.1165,0.672,5.9571,0.9099,0.1584,0.2007,1.3571,0.0053,0.0005,5.711,0.2232,1.7239,2.1192,1.8066,0.001,1.114,1.0604,5.6536,2.3317,0.0102,5.4116,1.7431,5.359,4.2475,0.7425,1.389,3.4122,0.1286,1.6934,2.0067,2.8593,3.3038,2.9444,0.8362,0.7443,2.0226,0.01,0.0007,3.7157,5.5067,3.2728,1.1235,0.0091,4.3834,2.2416,3.1291,5.0774,3.8591,1.4552,3.2389,3.3136,4.8028,4.6609,0.5401,1.2229,0.7176,0.2235,1.7403,3.3673,2.8453,2.6981,0.1014,0.6317,0.6823,4.8697,0.0011,0.0008,2.2579,6.2411,0.0053,3.4293,3.9369,2.2383,0.4598,5.5263,0.008,3.2477,0.5476,2.5515,1.4129,1.4709,2.1552,0.0114,0.0011,1.3736,2.8204,5.0418,0.3662,0.3254,1.2921,0.4009,0.6682,0.3024,0.0787,2.4837,0.2978,1.2399,0.8752,0.8058,1.7792,5.1059,2.988,0.4331,4.1676,3.4235,0.0731,3.9961,4.566,0.8304,0.5395,3.5498,3.3698,1.1568,6.153,6.8867,0.0124,5.3825,0.001,3.5005,1.128,2.5931,0.004,0.0004,1.0618,0.2407,0.3677,2.8167,5.1276,1.0161,1.2706,2.2983,0.644,5.1451,0.9387,3.5907,2.4534,2.0804,0.1525,1.177,1.1581,1.1986,3.2336,2.9558,0.132,5.9981,0.2213,4.8604,5.8377,1.0834,0.828,1.4541,0.2114,2.1476,0.0,0.2346,0.1487,2.9862,0.0018,5.1985,1.0845,1.0487,2.2059,4.798,1.7349,0.0882,2.6985,3.1865,0.0671,6.4549,0.0344,0.005,0.5121,2.887,1.6636,2.7551,0.8389,3.0721,0.011,3.7335,1.1698,0.6933,0.326,0.8704,2.3304,5.5284,5.4476]}
{"id":4836,"ended":false,"length":433,"gen_text":"The music video was filmed on 19 May 2009 at Venice Beach, Los Angeles, directed by Jonas \u00c5kerlund. Guetta revealed that the video's story and concept were designed to mimic the movie's opening, in which the main character finds herself in the middle of a car-crash with her parents' SUV parked nearby.\n\n\" 'The Boy' was written by a Swedish band called S\u00f6ren Ambarchi, and it was supposed to have all this different imagery. The guys just didn't think it would be what they wanted to put out. But then it actually made sense in the context of the world being so messed up with so much hate.\"\n\n\"I wanted to have a character who would be looking for love, but find a kind of love that's not really love or a love at all. It was the theme of being in another world, and it really makes some sense in the context of the world we lived in.\"\n\n\"Of course, what we wanted it to have was an emotional beat, and the music has a really powerful beat. But the key thing with a sound is what you can make out. We wanted to make it feel very real and something that was real to the point of it not making sense.\"\n\n\"There's a guy who's named Chris and he's in the song, which is sort of an obvious reference to Prince. I love the fact that 'the boy' is the character, and that he is the focus of the song and that it sort of becomes a film script. The video is sort of like a cinematic version of Prince's music video for 'Everyday,' and he's in that movie.\"\n\n\"And the whole goal with 'The Boy' is to create a musical version of 'Everyday,' with an emotional beat, a little bit of a happy ending, but sort of a dark ending. It is, in fact, a film. We had to make that part happen, because there was a lot of effort spent coming up with the concepts for the music video and trying to fit them into the movie.\"\n\n\"So I think the end result is, it was sort of a bit of a nightmare, but we got it done.\"","token_len":456,"entropy":[8.0865,3.4237,2.3615,3.0429,2.4466,7.3273,3.0895,3.8868,2.2137,8.2918,0.4866,1.0508,0.866,0.0024,0.6613,8.7479,0.0386,7.1741,3.0827,0.0114,0.067,0.0773,1.1181,9.112,4.4733,6.5477,0.9458,0.9133,1.0952,3.3643,5.1534,3.9831,3.0384,1.2698,5.9497,1.9545,5.7285,0.6634,3.9238,3.9436,3.4343,2.9182,2.8682,0.0546,1.533,1.8308,0.24,3.5862,3.2162,1.1114,1.6356,1.1924,0.0025,0.3582,4.3665,4.3693,1.1037,0.0283,3.5267,1.5643,4.4717,4.7082,5.5792,5.2236,1.7095,0.1969,1.1011,0.0007,1.7004,7.6642,2.7437,5.4851,1.4771,1.6528,3.2947,1.4583,2.4867,2.608,5.1995,0.511,4.6651,1.8307,2.207,3.1177,0.2303,0.0049,1.1475,1.2016,1.6601,1.3176,3.7506,0.0043,3.6492,5.3341,3.4151,5.2188,4.0233,2.5648,2.317,6.0769,5.5246,4.7948,0.0009,3.2762,0.6995,1.0223,1.3559,5.9972,2.2694,1.1262,0.9991,3.3987,0.6897,1.4271,2.1862,2.2323,2.952,5.2244,3.9469,2.022,3.2958,0.5144,1.9005,0.1461,0.4471,5.8697,7.3421,3.2483,3.0963,0.017,4.2454,2.3531,0.9983,4.9274,2.8492,0.5105,0.0002,2.1772,1.8079,2.952,0.4437,3.376,1.0448,4.1126,1.1939,3.3056,0.9938,5.8228,1.0286,2.1505,1.1816,1.7073,4.3677,3.0698,5.2838,0.0075,2.352,0.8413,2.7838,1.5094,1.7923,0.2899,5.9151,2.021,0.8231,3.9014,0.0351,0.4793,1.7079,1.7691,3.713,4.863,0.2542,4.0229,2.266,6.9808,0.9773,1.2157,1.4642,2.9797,4.3205,5.3796,6.0444,0.4084,1.1099,0.6119,0.4633,0.0611,0.643,1.5397,1.3477,5.8242,0.0202,1.361,0.1178,0.0002,1.2547,6.1636,0.0538,0.6202,5.117,2.3506,2.3042,4.6339,0.036,3.1063,0.2721,3.762,3.5539,4.6147,0.7984,1.2967,2.6655,1.8484,3.2013,1.8018,3.1534,2.9919,1.1223,1.0524,1.9174,2.0018,5.5096,1.7047,3.3558,3.5692,5.6393,0.8102,4.5445,1.4403,2.0897,3.7841,1.2681,1.6625,2.6797,1.0827,0.9405,0.8284,1.3036,3.0058,3.297,2.7898,1.7584,5.5783,0.5771,2.4109,2.7628,1.597,0.9904,5.2058,1.6665,2.1904,2.1397,3.6798,0.5352,1.5391,0.0668,0.0002,0.8319,3.3514,0.9861,0.7989,4.822,1.231,1.5588,5.8002,5.4706,2.8057,0.4367,0.5723,2.3476,1.2286,3.5404,1.1946,4.4586,0.5346,4.2997,0.0069,2.9222,4.4152,0.5421,0.4172,5.7463,0.7475,2.3052,3.419,1.8183,2.2198,0.0529,4.2639,3.8748,0.4456,0.0717,0.7791,2.6563,4.6056,2.4121,1.1197,2.0201,1.3143,3.1442,2.3389,5.1489,0.3628,0.2554,0.3808,3.0669,2.8775,2.0647,5.7152,0.0034,3.9877,1.3484,5.6056,6.0938,1.2399,2.724,4.1236,1.2117,2.5748,0.0024,1.591,0.689,5.3705,2.1286,0.0655,4.1104,0.3701,1.5857,1.2517,1.1999,0.1795,5.7247,0.4252,2.986,2.1534,4.3118,0.7866,2.4106,2.44,3.2186,1.6684,0.0632,0.0002,0.7178,4.4047,1.9752,2.9779,6.2694,2.1148,2.8179,0.1485,0.0053,0.0391,1.5645,0.3644,3.2879,0.6844,4.5495,2.1042,0.0267,2.0143,0.4689,0.0011,1.1055,3.186,3.7429,1.4391,1.3226,1.4841,2.687,4.7192,0.4811,0.4043,1.61,5.3717,0.6613,0.6209,2.1347,4.7478,0.0025,1.0474,2.525,0.8246,1.3153,1.4641,4.0964,4.4566,1.1609,3.3277,0.0144,0.8887,2.2145,2.3489,3.0463,3.558,1.7043,1.956,3.7694,4.6816,4.1488,1.6527,1.7535,3.0355,1.2221,2.2215,0.959,0.129,5.7331,4.2444,6.7222,0.0132,0.0028,0.9145,4.9256,2.0587,0.3266,1.6488,0.2521,1.2248,4.1287,0.018,5.2166,2.5403,0.4604,0.4111,2.8847,1.0751,0.0716,0.0002,0.6941,3.4423,2.6424,1.6318,1.8511,4.1786,0.4139,0.4572,4.2673,3.2637,3.591,3.4564,0.0025,1.1131,5.0041,0.4457,0.3335,3.3693,1.5202,0.7937,1.9902,2.0731,1.5839,0.459,1.1126]}
{"id":1149,"ended":false,"length":404,"gen_text":"Maria died shortly after giving birth to their daughter, Isabella, in late 1212. Her death triggered a legal dispute, with John of Ibelin ( who administered Jerusalem before John's coronation in 1206) asking John of Gaunt for lands on the grounds that Isabella had died in 'outrage' and did not leave any surviving heirs.\nThe case was referred to Pope Leo IX, who denied John access to those lands after his predecessor Gregory IX had granted them to Queen Joanna of Sicily.\nKing John, on the other hand, argued he could not have been King of Northumbria or Sicily because his father had been killed. On 6 December 1214, he invaded the kingdom and won a victory on 9 January at Agincourt.\nBy spring 1215, Isabella's mother died and Isabella took over her duties as regent while another daughter, Agnes, was born. The next year, Isabella died suddenly during the birth of her youngest daughter. John of Gaunt, who never returned to the throne, took Isabella's lands and left his wife for Agnes.\nJohn of Gaunt's victory over Isabella of Sicily was so complete that some historians call him the last English king. Agnes married John of Gaunt's father, Henry of Gaunt, who became Duke of Somerset, which was the first great change in English history under the Tudor dynasty. At the same time, the two Johns - Agnes and John of Gaunt - had a daughter named Catherine. When John of Gaunt died in 1250, three Johns had now inherited the English throne.\nIt is fair to say that the English throne went from John of Gaunt and Agnes of Lancaster to George of Denmark and their descendants - the Hanoverians. After the Tudors, the last English monarch to be King of England was Henry III of Lancaster ( 1377 - 1440. George III of Denmark succeeded him as King of England - a position that was never challenged during his reign. His sons John, Henry IV and William of Orange took the throne by force of arms. The Tudors succeeded the Hanoverians in the throne until the Stuart dynasty fell in the 16th century.\n\u00a9 Richard B.

{"id":4975,"ended":true,"length":403,"gen_text":"On July 18, a tropical storm formed from a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone and was named Doreen. It steadily intensified, and became a hurricane on July 19. Doreen briefly became Tropical Storm Doreen, before becoming Doreen again. On July 22, Doreen was upgraded to a hurricane, and was renamed Doreen-A.\n\nIt was expected that Tropical Storm Doreen would remain a tropical storm for the next 48 hours after coming ashore. The strongest winds reached up to 70 knots on Barbuda and 30 knots on St. Martin, while wind gusts reached 85 knots on Saint Martin. The hurricane intensified from a tropical storm to a category 1 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds between 95 and 110 mph.\n\nBy late afternoon AID's satellite images confirmed that Doreen was already turning into a more intense hurricane while tracking northwest away from the islands. It remained extremely dangerous and dangerous, but it would make landfall sometime Saturday morning.\n\nDoreen left the islands early Saturday, however, and the Bahamas National Hurricane Center reported that some of the winds dissipated by midnight Saturday. Doreen reached the Turks and Caicos on Saturday morning as a remnant low, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph.\n\nMeteorologists at the National Hurricane Center noted that even after the remnants of this storm dissipate (late Saturday night), it may still impact the northern Caribbean Sea. Meteorologists will continue to monitor this system over the next few days, especially as the wind trends over the next days.\n\nIn the Florida Keys, the Department of Transportation reports that power outages are expected to persist due to the damage caused by the hurricane. Key West Beach, including the Florida Keys Beach Resort, had sustained catastrophic damage and was completely closed for the remainder of 2017 at the beginning of August.

{"id":4904,"ended":false,"length":371,"gen_text":"Shortly after the beginning of the German invasion of the Soviet Union in World War II, the curators responsible for removing the art treasures in Leningrad tried to disassemble and remove the Amber Room, where some of the stolen paintings were taken by the Russians. The work of art had been in the National Gallery for over a century, although it has never actually been removed in public, save a couple of brief displays. In 2004, the museum decided to display the Amber Room on its own site. The decision to have the gallery itself on the museum's premises came about partly because of the interest shown by foreign governments in the room, and partly because it was considered so important that people who were planning to visit could have a better idea of what it was.\n\nThe Amber Room was the first of a number of paintings that were later discovered to be smuggled out of the USSR while they still were in the possession of members of the Imperial family. In recent years, the art pieces, including the famous Mona Lisa, and others, have returned to the collection and now sit on permanent display alongside other objects of the Soviet period.\n\nThe Amber Room contains a collection of Russian paintings and drawings by prominent artists from the 19th century, like Nikolay Rudopovich Rublev, Peter Paul Rublev, Igor Stravinsky, Aleksandr Pushkin, Ivan Turgenev, Grigory Likhachev, Fyodor Tyutchev, Mikhail Bulgakov, Aleksandr Prokofiev, Mikhail Sholokhov, and Mikhail Vosnitsky. Many of these artists became influential among the Russian emigres who went to work in the West, and their portraits and sketches from the period give visitors insight into the creative lives of early Soviet art. The room is also home to a series of photographs by Russian artists, such as Nikolay Nikolaevitch Sholokhov (1864-1932), Sergei Chizhov (1865-1930), Mikhail Sholokhov (1866-1930), Mikhail Kondratyev (1872-1926) and Andrei Gubarev (1876-1938).\n\nGallery on exhibition [ edit ]\n\nBibliography [ edit ]","token_len":458,"entropy":[0.1865,1.1402,6.4579,0.0282,0.4247,7.5272,1.486,0.7579,1.1907,0.2012,0.0032,1.2492,7.5974,0.0011,0.0972,0.1366,1.2592,12.1534,0.3719,8.0484,0.0385,7.0599,0.6465,4.8269,4.1802,3.8379,5.564,0.0181,0.0087,6.8959,0.1413,7.6393,0.4224,0.0006,2.9726,2.6284,0.7214,10.4756,0.1578,1.5808,4.804,4.1025,0.4109,0.1946,5.2885,1.796,0.5856,5.4119,2.587,0.5127,5.0566,0.3715,1.6843,4.3476,1.4815,1.0405,2.2229,0.8527,2.8951,0.5471,6.2619,0.4905,2.3804,2.1494,1.7609,0.4785,0.9844,5.6464,1.0671,4.3315,1.3309,4.9852,0.1151,5.1058,5.2425,3.3407,2.514,5.9398,3.7311,3.9759,0.0737,1.6702,4.3465,1.33,3.2536,5.1184,0.1633,1.0161,2.3421,3.0226,0.3238,2.9205,0.5184,0.5378,0.0026,3.3351,1.8086,1.4005,3.5361,1.9894,2.0096,3.4015,2.5142,4.2636,0.5207,3.5746,4.028,3.8811,1.6146,2.4995,0.7537,1.1159,3.7965,2.0547,4.8674,0.73,0.8977,0.7456,5.4644,2.369,0.5387,3.9016,3.303,1.0525,0.4129,3.7847,1.0825,1.103,0.3232,0.2232,2.4536,0.8883,3.5088,6.5367,1.1402,0.7245,5.3851,3.0067,2.2913,5.0345,0.261,0.9378,4.0658,3.8928,1.2095,2.67,1.2882,0.0963,0.403,1.9019,0.74,1.3204,0.8772,0.0092,1.2124,1.4882,0.0032,1.7683,3.1288,1.9824,2.6049,2.5495,1.7307,0.0048,4.0859,1.2053,1.0662,4.729,2.6848,0.4639,1.3799,6.7953,0.3363,0.0482,0.6524,1.792,5.8935,2.9451,3.0993,2.0216,0.7393,0.7532,1.6257,0.0042,5.4719,0.0165,0.0912,5.8443,0.5477,0.427,2.692,4.8864,0.1328,0.1729,1.1655,4.9531,5.6551,3.3679,2.0149,1.8769,2.6336,2.9835,0.046,0.0007,0.4384,4.169,3.7946,1.5764,0.617,4.5319,0.1097,1.0745,3.7558,3.2021,3.6654,2.3659,1.464,2.3524,0.2263,4.7669,1.8509,4.093,1.923,1.8159,2.4672,1.5652,0.6157,0.8847,0.0002,1.3771,1.2178,0.0032,5.6811,1.8592,2.7664,0.031,4.1517,1.6036,2.3533,1.6475,1.958,3.6494,0.6342,2.8795,0.2471,1.8887,0.0055,0.6584,1.4662,5.6728,3.1255,2.5393,5.1988,6.0346,3.2832,5.2033,0.6863,0.9297,4.7761,2.2797,0.0001,1.1905,0.2543,6.0143,0.9289,0.1501,0.011,0.1747,4.0019,0.1262,0.0651,1.9633,0.0009,0.1886,3.3145,3.3797,0.1055,0.0035,0.003,0.1655,5.6925,0.1199,1.1285,3.0258,3.1468,0.2044,0.2326,5.7343,0.0626,0.0001,2.3859,0.012,0.013,0.2389,3.2113,2.8075,0.0005,0.1741,3.2531,0.0952,0.0411,3.9673,0.144,0.2293,0.1202,0.1565,3.3532,2.3959,0.3586,0.0143,0.0386,0.2205,1.2545,3.479,4.3609,0.5685,4.0535,0.9933,0.6368,0.2765,3.643,0.0943,1.0612,0.82,4.9042,4.8282,5.2175,0.8899,1.7215,4.9159,0.6413,0.1595,0.9375,3.4121,0.1483,3.5147,0.1161,0.4747,1.0416,1.3014,0.8598,2.3393,5.4083,1.4206,2.4518,4.4176,0.5864,1.9536,5.9455,5.4923,4.7457,0.0188,0.6297,5.4295,3.534,0.0902,3.9529,3.0411,3.8218,0.5757,2.1174,2.2811,2.0805,0.977,1.0672,0.0035,1.273,3.5041,0.0033,4.1306,1.6373,3.3745,2.0899,1.1521,3.4977,0.0034,3.1131,0.9105,5.5163,0.0107,4.2697,3.4715,1.7821,0.0258,0.0169,2.6074,0.3237,4.0634,0.3918,0.0756,3.4445,0.2495,3.832,4.682,3.7757,0.7763,0.2718,0.0766,3.6302,0.0261,0.0853,3.2915,0.0732,2.6305,2.751,0.7378,0.0259,0.0458,0.3571,0.0406,1.8447,0.0149,0.0637,2.5663,0.0795,2.334,3.5624,3.0371,0.46,0.8691,0.0725,0.1062,0.0309,3.2708,0.0093,0.1451,4.0719,2.8923,0.0643,4.6364,0.0341,3.945,3.8058,1.2349,0.0163,0.0711,0.0602,2.9335,0.0048,0.2124,2.9989,0.4501,0.681,0.0002,5.1729,5.3971,4.7003,3.2962,0.0934,0.0139,0.0269,0.0003,5.1374,0.8664,0.0547,0.0002,0.0002]}

{"id":2637,"ended":true,"length":417,"gen_text":"As mandated by the Paralympic Charter, various elements frame the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games. Most of these rituals were established at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp. The ceremony typically includes military parades, parade of military vehicles, and military band. The procession begins in front of the National Stadium and proceeds along the waterfront across the Dutch city, crossing the Rood, the two bridges, and into the harbour. The procession includes over 100 military vehicles of all types, including six ambulances, six fire engines, three armored vehicles and 10 pieces of special purpose military equipment. The military band is the biggest element of the opening ceremony. The first band will feature the bands of the Netherlands and Belgium, followed by the Australian Commonwealth and then the Great Britain. The procession will pass the historic Grand Place, followed by the Olympic Village. The procession will then pass the Dutch Air Force Randsdam military hangar, which dates back to the 1890ss. The Paralympic flags, symbolizing the Paralympic Movement and the Netherlands, will then be flown over the Rood. After the procession has passed the Rood, a military band plays, the Paralympic anthem is sung and the flags will be hoisted. The military band plays again after the parade has passed the stadium. From the Dutch Pavilion, the Paralympic Anthem will be sung, accompanied by the playing of French, French and English instruments.\n\nThe ceremony will also feature a military flypast over the Rood. The ceremony is then followed by the Fireworks display in the main arena, following that by a performance by the New Zealand Fire Service. The event will last for two-and-a-half hours. During the first half of the Games, a full display of the fireworks will be produced and displayed in the New Zealand Pavilion, followed at the beginning of the second half by the Australian Performance Team.\n\nThe opening ceremony is the first part of the final preparations before the main Games. The Opening Ceremony will be composed over a period of several months. It will then be followed by the Opening Ceremonies, which include the flag ceremony, the marching order, the welcoming ceremony and, in the case of the Canadian Team, the Parapan Games Opening Ceremony.","token_len":459,"entropy":[11.0773,0.1612,0.7699,10.8731,0.0199,0.142,1.0504,0.2637,9.0048,5.0426,14.3764,0.3989,6.7314,0.6466,2.0245,0.3484,1.4087,0.0002,0.5958,0.0541,0.6958,5.9899,1.3694,0.6637,7.7921,3.1772,2.6566,3.1591,0.1199,6.0263,3.5134,2.05,0.4558,1.6574,0.0001,0.0025,1.3966,1.6657,3.4639,5.8981,1.2071,5.9973,2.3222,0.0123,0.4508,6.0628,2.2124,2.8631,2.1674,0.3757,2.2197,2.4392,3.7227,1.2894,1.3744,4.9561,3.8426,2.4498,1.6137,0.0033,0.176,3.7414,0.798,1.37,2.0478,2.8261,0.6908,3.5526,6.1018,0.2541,5.8283,2.3732,2.3343,4.8907,0.7347,4.4596,3.2762,2.7931,1.6696,5.8037,0.8956,1.0447,0.476,4.964,0.2211,4.9739,0.3833,1.0138,2.0612,3.2714,4.8682,2.1215,0.6822,0.2645,4.7528,1.6154,0.5269,0.7604,0.7586,5.0119,4.8143,0.0006,0.7191,2.7629,2.9999,0.7623,0.0983,2.7883,2.7272,0.9916,2.6934,5.0374,5.204,0.0039,6.5519,3.0457,1.4323,0.5407,0.4115,1.0205,2.1168,0.7755,1.9826,3.05,4.5508,2.1487,0.4638,0.1153,1.7535,0.1029,0.7613,1.227,4.2559,3.257,4.5531,5.1775,1.7861,5.3032,0.3904,0.5836,1.0836,1.4615,1.0475,1.0821,1.3608,0.0239,0.8701,4.1459,5.0702,1.6381,2.3722,0.6229,6.2702,0.0264,0.8224,0.8645,3.3741,1.4486,2.4973,1.2083,5.506,5.0855,1.6924,0.9932,5.3765,0.0165,0.3319,3.4816,3.0486,1.7285,0.8592,2.1601,0.5538,1.2451,1.4172,0.5422,3.2826,5.5713,0.0814,6.4011,5.9156,4.1339,4.7767,4.7773,0.9719,2.2593,5.6184,0.2011,0.0223,0.5923,4.719,7.6656,0.8563,0.833,5.9691,0.0006,0.1761,6.513,3.0217,4.8103,0.3326,0.4768,2.2965,0.0085,0.2593,1.6466,2.2535,0.6893,3.4206,0.2154,0.3702,2.0767,0.2615,2.1247,1.7977,0.0818,2.3786,0.0382,0.8046,3.1056,0.3882,1.7697,2.8247,0.2797,0.5121,0.7477,0.0002,0.1862,2.352,1.4226,0.7902,3.0325,4.0686,2.1675,1.9447,0.0005,0.1003,1.7686,1.3796,1.6401,1.1396,0.5248,3.7917,2.0409,0.2763,3.6992,0.0006,1.5198,0.9134,3.5574,0.242,2.4526,1.7292,2.6836,0.1621,2.2916,1.3969,0.3098,0.2093,3.974,0.6992,5.6284,0.5618,3.3003,5.6261,0.5321,0.5251,2.4676,0.0003,0.0921,4.3744,1.1041,0.1472,0.747,1.7355,4.1585,0.0358,1.0099,4.214,0.0069,6.5219,1.9294,4.2982,1.3637,0.6813,1.687,0.258,2.8418,0.0152,1.1877,2.9445,1.8387,2.3561,1.7722,1.1519,1.7888,3.5556,0.5763,2.5662,0.1752,3.0014,0.0045,1.0817,1.1112,4.1468,2.4926,3.401,0.7386,0.0238,0.9319,5.4529,0.4929,1.4743,3.3464,0.6387,4.0312,2.8051,1.9078,5.4248,6.8211,1.2049,1.4115,3.089,0.4605,0.2523,6.1917,0.2555,2.4909,0.3532,1.2738,1.1399,4.2911,1.4704,2.2959,1.2315,2.6363,5.2213,0.0477,0.0125,0.0257,0.0254,0.003,0.1169,0.496,4.2819,0.2475,4.4049,1.1593,0.4906,0.0206,5.6281,0.1907,3.1928,4.3575,5.181,0.3411,1.7831,2.658,0.6357,0.4049,5.0053,2.833,2.4669,1.6071,0.3882,4.4015,0.0991,0.497,1.7413,1.4123,6.7853,0.2005,4.0614,0.0403,0.031,0.3426,0.0618,0.14,0.8159,3.3849,6.7367,1.0684,0.5551,1.1915,0.0002,1.1193,1.8279,0.1365,1.5589,2.185,2.0561,3.2129,0.0258,0.1514,5.834,3.3671,2.4241,0.0501,4.7861,2.6109,1.3586,1.1872,3.6257,0.0304,0.0961,2.41,1.1711,6.7173,8.5303,1.5367,1.2078,0.0278,1.9038,1.7489,1.2381,2.0019,1.7581,3.9153,0.4096,1.4229,0.0896,0.3827,1.4648,0.0364,2.2549,0.0027,2.602,1.0995,2.6199,0.4915,5.6597,3.1274,0.6101,0.7469,4.2342,5.0976,0.8771,0.4754,5.7124,1.2339,1.1596,4.8962,1.7229,0.5839,0.3401,0.0075,0.3988,5.3159,2.6321,0.0531,0.252,5.3184,1.0567,0.6107,1.6594,0.0584,0.4168,0.2025]}
{"id":2014,"ended":false,"length":407,"gen_text":"On August 27, a tropical wave formed over the central Caribbean and tracked towards the west @ - @ northwest. The system gradually developed organized shower and thunderstorm activity. By September 1, the entire Tropical Storm Warning for the central Caribbean was reduced to a Tropical Storm Warning for eastern parts of Central America. By September 5, the center of the system moved to northwest of Nicaragua, producing a band of rain centered near Nicaragua that caused widespread flooding and mudslides. On September 6, the entire tropical storm warning for the central and western Caribbean was reduced to a Tropical Storm Warning for northern Nicaragua, Central America, and western Mexico. As of September 9, the center of Tropical Storm Erika was located near 19.2 north latitude and 74.6 west longitude with an approximate wind speed of 120 miles per hour. Maximum sustained winds were near 75 mph.\n\nA hurricane watch was issued for the northern Leeward Islands (including Puerto Rico), northern Martinique, and Saint Pierre and Miquelon on August 26. Hurricane conditions were not expected north of Bermuda until Sunday, September 1 during the early morning. A Hurricane Watch was later issued for the northern Leeward Islands on September 5. Hurricane conditions were not expected to develop north of Bermuda through Sunday, September 8. Hurricane conditions were expected north of the northernmost portion of the eastern Leeward Islands on Saturday, September 7.\n\nThe Tropical Storm Warning for the northernmost portion of the eastern Leeward Islands had been reduced to a tropical storm warning on August 30. At 8:15 a.m., the NHC Hurricane Center issued a Tropical Storm Warning for the eastern-estimate portions of Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Cuba, and Haiti. The hurricane center forecasted continuous tropical storm conditions through Sunday night and Sunday morning.\n\nAs Hurricane Erika approached central Cuba at 8:55 a.m. on September 4, the hurricane center forecasted that the system will move to the west-northwest and become a hurricane by Sunday. The storm will continue to strengthen north-northwest at 18 mph, may approach the Bahamas during the first hour of the storm, and then will become a hurricane after the storm moves over Haiti. The NHC said hurricane impact remains very rare.\n\nAdditional resources","token_len":460,"entropy":[5.2053,3.6485,0.2986,3.3216,9.7416,4.9234,4.0005,2.3225,0.6114,3.3538,4.7812,1.9042,5.625,3.7168,0.6394,3.0816,15.4849,7.644,11.677,9.9289,2.0317,1.7672,2.8495,5.3818,3.1823,13.0536,9.2879,1.3064,0.0668,0.2212,0.4435,1.4751,3.1315,2.5923,1.4082,0.4839,0.5594,5.6672,5.06,0.3576,3.6127,3.0715,0.8395,2.0119,0.3262,0.8261,3.9744,0.0803,0.8301,0.1773,0.0992,0.6664,1.4635,4.8741,6.1967,0.0204,4.5186,0.1094,0.5509,2.6581,0.1457,2.1885,0.1055,0.5742,3.0253,0.1054,0.6558,1.3978,2.7407,2.7076,4.2271,0.6112,3.8744,1.6897,5.8742,1.7417,5.0792,0.0078,1.8769,4.4847,1.6445,2.1506,3.1638,3.4463,2.7263,0.9666,1.479,0.4285,0.0024,0.009,0.4135,2.5446,0.0672,1.268,0.0989,0.4928,4.6803,2.9076,0.278,0.0369,0.7763,0.6071,0.4654,4.0418,1.8329,0.2188,0.1376,0.4067,0.0304,0.5463,0.22,0.1138,0.1779,0.1968,4.2957,2.316,2.393,1.8575,0.0113,0.9188,0.2643,2.9502,2.4943,0.1439,4.1256,0.3203,0.1422,1.7877,0.0274,0.5382,0.7157,0.0711,1.8216,0.0312,4.9026,0.0236,0.6403,0.1101,0.6321,4.7963,0.1582,2.4464,0.7945,1.2514,0.4744,4.6228,0.0265,2.2009,0.4116,0.0102,0.0073,4.0753,2.2506,1.9744,1.1874,0.0556,0.0461,4.486,1.9557,0.0716,0.0016,0.1307,2.5086,0.0246,0.0439,0.8938,0.1678,3.0389,0.6901,1.2099,1.8745,0.0017,3.596,2.5651,0.4722,0.5241,0.4884,0.2603,0.9405,1.8659,1.6023,0.0003,0.0054,0.0069,3.2754,2.6153,0.653,0.0061,2.0774,4.2278,3.0693,0.0003,0.1216,0.656,2.722,3.2159,0.0669,0.001,0.0006,0.0001,0.0,1.775,3.3096,2.3175,0.6159,2.5062,0.7059,0.3156,4.6154,0.2353,6.3525,0.0645,4.0355,1.219,3.6044,0.6208,0.1352,1.6298,8.1864,0.2958,0.7898,0.5579,2.2286,2.6356,3.0526,0.7103,0.4873,3.3741,0.2025,0.1102,0.4321,0.8185,0.2169,0.0,0.0087,0.0089,1.8276,0.8846,1.9907,0.3901,2.1282,0.135,0.2313,1.5641,0.0426,1.1842,1.0794,2.9616,0.0219,0.5359,4.42,1.3882,0.2114,0.0547,0.8537,0.6654,2.4708,0.1346,0.1714,0.7237,3.967,0.0088,2.2749,2.1037,3.9646,4.3314,0.0034,0.5173,4.4227,0.4139,0.0001,0.0106,0.0111,1.1212,2.8777,0.0868,0.0172,0.7411,0.9289,0.9835,0.0002,2.3908,3.6875,0.1252,0.2938,0.8674,0.5673,1.3329,5.4598,1.0975,0.0038,0.093,0.1465,0.0207,0.0001,0.0086,0.0092,4.7106,0.1951,0.7275,0.077,0.2136,2.9027,0.0407,0.1773,0.2955,1.6593,2.5711,0.315,4.8534,3.3905,0.6984,2.7797,1.5483,0.0011,0.0004,2.6603,0.8239,3.8649,0.0111,4.4669,1.2302,1.2202,0.2453,1.4971,0.0247,0.128,0.1256,0.3833,2.9197,6.4662,9.2868,1.1101,1.7609,0.0043,2.871,0.0005,0.4479,2.5432,0.0024,0.0405,4.8462,0.0454,0.8164,1.1432,0.4885,1.6618,2.6513,0.9508,3.4579,0.3129,6.3301,2.0242,0.2835,0.6402,2.0025,1.298,3.3992,2.3809,2.7498,0.4909,1.2789,1.1037,0.0002,3.8439,4.5887,0.1516,0.0002,1.1884,5.3927,1.8427,5.7176,2.1438,0.1548,4.1452,0.3337,0.0009,0.0001,0.2933,0.4158,0.8355,2.2896,0.0219,0.8995,2.8781,0.023,1.4081,0.0334,3.4229,0.8388,2.0039,3.9518,3.713,2.7232,0.2141,1.8813,0.4924,0.0945,0.0029,1.7942,1.6053,0.203,1.5762,1.2114,1.6324,2.9315,1.4772,2.6404,2.5776,2.5951,0.1434,1.8953,4.9044,3.7003,0.9136,0.0358,2.6753,4.2004,0.256,2.1312,6.0957,4.1048,0.4461,2.9104,3.5405,0.2211,4.1021,2.299,0.3833,0.2204,1.8315,0.4486,0.1762,1.9701,2.5714,2.7895,0.1442,0.4437,4.4066,1.9736,1.9353,2.0477,1.3784,3.2714,0.6167,1.4365,2.1892,0.0025,3.5056,3.8784,6.6263,5.8573,2.8598,5.1175,2.6142,0.6195,0.0003,5.3308,5.1413]}
{"id":1561,"ended":false,"length":410,"gen_text":"Hamels created and currently runs an organization known as The Hamels Foundation with his wife, Heidi Strobel. The foundation was created in 2008. The Hamels Foundation funds childhood programs in Philadelphia and has donated over $150,000 to The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\nThe Phillies have already donated $50,000 to the foundation and will follow through with that in the next couple of months. The foundation is also donating $5000 for Hamels' annual trip to Texas after his contract is up in 2018.\n\nThe Hamels Foundation also has raised money for multiple charities and it is easy to see the foundation's impact. As we noted earlier this summer, the Phillies had raised more than $2.5 million for various charitable groups since 2010.\n\nLast spring, the Philadelphia Phillies donated an undisclosed amount of money to the Children's Hospital of Orange County in recognition of the upcoming 25th anniversary of the hospital.\n\nThis summer, the Phillies opened the \"The Tommy and Mary Harrickes Club\" to benefit the Harricks Family Foundation and the Ronald McDonald House. The club has raised more than $400,000 for the charities.\n\nIt also helps that Hamels will become eligible for some type of a salary increase based on average annual value from $16.1 million to $19.1 million, even after the 2017 season. The Phillies will receive a $1.75 million signing bonus for Hamels, but they can increase his salaries until the end of 2019.\n\nEven though Hamels may be a bit disgruntled with the organization following his two seasons with the Phillies, he is a fan favorite with Philadelphia and many will likely be cheering for him in 2018. If he is unable to perform, then the Phillies would not receive any compensation for his departure, as they would only owe him an adjustment.\n\nThere has been talk of a buyout in case Hamels fails to perform, but he is still owed a salary for next season. He will receive a $4.4 million salary. The Phillies will have the rights to his 2018 club option after the 2018 season.\n\nWith that said, Hamels may have something to say about what the Phillies are doing to him.\n\nFollow Philadelphia Phillies coverage on Twitter: @PhilliesBlog","token_len":462,"entropy":[6.6851,9.3849,5.2026,7.9262,2.2521,3.6944,2.6209,4.6163,0.0326,2.6901,7.426,0.4704,0.6956,5.1068,1.2752,0.7641,0.5807,5.246,10.6856,0.6053,0.8351,1.0075,1.1049,3.3606,1.6682,1.2966,3.1797,3.6429,1.7447,1.0969,0.0473,0.0998,4.193,6.9323,5.4877,1.7555,5.5548,1.3863,3.4113,2.5935,1.9689,0.1305,4.283,0.1259,0.0037,0.4399,4.646,1.4153,0.0182,0.1799,0.1259,0.0203,0.9303,0.941,0.0015,1.7645,5.1167,2.114,4.482,2.6824,0.7637,2.6863,0.0155,0.0079,0.3466,0.5292,1.5101,2.2802,1.9907,6.0409,1.1934,0.5364,2.6062,3.9676,1.1057,2.6249,2.1996,0.2933,1.5821,0.2323,1.9598,2.0131,2.319,1.57,3.4948,0.8075,7.4689,2.6932,3.2752,0.0086,0.595,3.3985,3.7438,0.1045,4.5191,5.7236,1.8051,2.4043,1.4109,0.1657,1.6739,1.8975,0.149,0.4198,0.0002,1.6565,1.1791,0.0147,0.0951,2.1231,2.5345,4.1746,1.9074,0.2554,5.3037,1.2764,2.6433,5.2895,1.6216,5.4979,0.0335,0.1422,2.7392,4.3557,1.1593,1.4994,1.2523,4.5922,3.6494,3.264,1.6092,1.1087,3.5251,0.1394,1.0496,2.1647,3.5292,2.2539,2.3152,0.0473,0.037,2.9304,0.7526,1.0979,0.0844,0.6627,2.2119,2.8163,3.5773,1.6508,3.3244,0.263,0.6338,0.0002,4.7441,4.9001,0.2481,1.2372,4.6947,1.2262,3.295,4.5277,1.5317,0.1771,0.8438,0.3923,0.1471,0.8132,3.4562,0.0109,0.0816,0.1227,8.6528,0.0228,2.0758,3.428,0.0726,1.5255,5.7956,3.2353,0.0229,0.2318,0.0864,0.6716,2.1419,1.2277,1.0757,0.0002,3.8763,3.1236,0.1597,0.3714,0.6063,6.1811,1.3699,2.8386,3.3062,5.6407,6.5788,5.1117,6.1279,5.8673,4.1847,5.5564,0.8195,2.441,1.1537,0.9381,2.9702,2.8571,3.2121,0.3049,2.708,1.4205,4.9579,0.0106,0.0149,1.4995,1.1121,0.8399,2.9441,1.0173,1.1973,0.0029,0.0115,4.0489,0.0078,0.0045,0.872,0.9103,1.3603,0.6513,0.3191,0.0002,3.8128,4.2564,2.5136,0.9819,0.7433,0.0037,4.8999,4.8452,3.3358,0.0593,6.3467,2.791,0.005,4.3566,1.9403,1.6568,5.535,0.1246,5.8339,0.4316,0.2407,4.0762,2.6946,2.6189,0.3837,2.5491,0.0771,0.6895,0.0796,2.063,0.3463,2.103,0.0273,2.9592,5.7244,2.6554,1.4295,3.0103,0.0629,0.2792,2.4697,1.6659,1.9128,3.0525,1.17,1.4399,1.8984,0.768,3.5365,0.0869,3.0347,0.0028,1.3592,0.8808,0.001,1.7063,2.858,2.0423,2.0151,4.1615,0.8298,4.9416,4.3155,1.5744,0.953,0.0029,2.6643,0.9977,0.4175,0.0002,4.8001,1.3909,1.1679,0.0011,3.7219,1.6931,2.4516,2.9985,3.7398,1.3241,0.6772,3.7101,4.3474,1.2103,5.4162,2.6183,1.1864,0.2193,0.4498,0.074,1.223,1.719,2.5057,2.8375,0.1199,3.2572,3.2327,1.6957,4.8158,3.5048,3.4683,1.7103,3.4177,0.6271,0.2037,2.005,3.2074,0.3719,4.3758,1.4449,2.477,3.3863,0.004,3.6345,2.6624,3.569,1.125,0.7273,2.8037,3.4626,2.1729,0.9765,0.6587,1.6819,1.5214,0.5475,2.3529,2.1284,1.309,1.3386,2.379,2.4417,0.6914,3.6749,6.1553,2.3282,0.4959,0.0002,4.3498,3.2215,0.2403,2.6303,1.4415,1.5179,3.5667,0.0273,3.0736,6.3049,0.5982,0.0008,3.9818,0.1977,0.6717,1.3445,0.2734,3.2248,1.6066,2.338,2.2265,2.1972,3.9329,1.9474,2.679,0.2041,0.848,3.1381,1.8941,2.8647,0.8028,0.3665,3.4108,0.8368,4.5894,0.0168,0.649,4.564,2.5471,0.7369,1.7296,2.3182,2.4595,5.0267,0.0362,2.9332,3.2035,2.2366,0.1151,3.9246,0.6851,1.5904,0.031,0.8582,0.6789,0.0002,4.0874,2.8327,0.964,0.0076,1.9111,0.0012,2.7383,2.3693,4.6252,0.6548,0.2312,0.3678,4.3842,1.2178,0.2897,1.3746,0.4682,1.6427,0.4617,0.7359,1.6797,0.0002,1.4878,5.8559,0.3722,5.131,0.023,0.3571,1.8149,0.2581,0.0235,0.0022,1.1974]}

She received four rifled 110 @ - @ pounder breech @ - @ loading guns mounted on the side and three in the rear of the hull mounted on the hull. The front plate had five 7.5 inch guns with a top gun firing 15 lbs. shell. The side plate carried one 12 gauge @ - @ pounder field gun.\nWith this armament of her she was capable of dealing with any Japanese ship she encountered, and most of them were at least partly designed to take pot shots at her. But she was also capable of maneuvering into position so that she could strike out and attack, and she had torpedoes on top of her boat decks.\nBy 1945, the Americans had given away any ability to fight off Japanese cruiser's, as more and more ships were moving away from the US, some with little less than a 50-50 chance to actually see a single shot fired. Even the Japanese had become so well equipped that they were able to hit American ships at long range, and the Americans were only able to fend them off by not bringing any of their own. In fact, not until WWII had the US had enough ships to really fight the Japanese when they got very close.\nSo where were they to go after the war, if they could not defend against the onslaught of the Japanese?\nUnfortunately, Japan had been losing so quickly after the war began that they had no means of making any real progress. By 1945 they had suffered 1,350,000 casualties, and the war was over.\nThis was the same war where the US and her allies were getting the most terrible losses, and Japan, China and India were getting the lightest.\nThis was the same war I helped with, at my own expense, when Japan was very weak.\nThis I am telling you to warn the people in Japan, that Japan may not be so strong after all\nThe real history will not be told. The only thing that will be told is one side's viewpoint, and that's just not good for the people of Japan.\nThis story will help you not get suckered into wasting your money when the big companies are going to try and stop you!","token_len":462,"entropy":[9.9908,10.7549,1.1899,1.1288,12.6916,8.9382,8.4009,1.6753,0.5139,2.2047,0.0247,3.1344,1.2183,1.0679,0.9143,5.4504,2.4966,8.0823,6.1271,3.6035,5.4239,0.2728,9.3466,13.8588,7.519,10.359,8.1698,0.3305,5.858,0.0265,14.9451,3.3166,1.5242,7.2296,2.6337,4.663,1.0229,1.9399,3.9675,2.5995,4.7122,4.1946,0.2579,1.3558,2.4204,0.1656,0.5431,7.3676,0.398,0.9262,2.7388,2.0224,1.322,3.9962,5.6479,3.1806,4.821,4.6277,0.7544,0.9508,0.9722,2.4262,2.7768,1.2157,4.8416,5.2085,3.7038,5.3097,3.6017,1.2639,4.21,1.1316,0.7328,2.7028,2.1628,2.3814,3.1377,2.2861,5.4708,4.2678,0.8289,0.1627,1.9024,0.0468,6.08,0.224,1.5425,2.712,7.3176,3.1591,0.6734,0.0032,4.9847,2.7227,2.3248,0.8349,2.1998,0.0486,4.2885,0.4156,1.2877,5.0312,3.1806,2.527,1.2972,2.4902,1.97,5.3837,1.1765,1.1725,1.8443,4.0343,0.911,5.5915,4.5062,0.3889,3.1338,6.0908,0.4981,0.1115,0.3259,0.1828,4.1763,1.9078,0.8152,1.6723,2.7267,0.0235,5.6445,0.0517,3.6905,1.6125,4.9023,0.6368,0.4886,0.137,4.459,3.8149,1.7844,2.0838,3.6092,1.2177,1.7678,2.4846,5.3353,0.0044,4.1462,4.971,0.6518,0.8027,4.43,2.863,1.2878,1.2771,5.2191,4.8513,1.3515,1.3308,3.9673,0.7238,5.1535,4.8012,6.2237,5.1715,0.1689,2.2311,3.2022,1.6516,5.6965,3.6083,1.8759,4.3199,6.3745,0.3157,0.0059,3.4876,0.5329,5.1493,3.378,0.054,0.6847,3.3418,3.0654,5.4524,3.5339,4.9521,5.7859,0.1243,2.091,4.2557,2.5669,1.2819,0.2625,3.1687,3.9366,3.7377,2.4657,3.7523,4.0187,1.0381,1.3577,4.1585,1.444,2.2597,2.0258,3.8361,2.6712,3.5329,1.7706,0.9855,0.9962,1.0796,1.3219,0.006,5.1514,2.1735,0.8359,1.7813,1.6699,0.4182,1.51,0.9214,2.3937,2.1343,1.0636,4.4109,1.0889,0.0052,5.1707,0.833,0.0191,1.7838,5.5493,5.9643,2.2523,1.2013,0.0604,0.857,3.9011,3.7901,1.6883,0.2446,6.042,2.6778,5.8034,1.4263,0.8615,0.6495,2.852,2.5895,1.65,0.5044,3.8434,2.3572,1.9443,0.1528,5.2248,0.5529,3.9532,6.6,0.2804,0.7348,0.6304,3.2526,4.9979,2.4664,2.2802,3.7782,0.6563,3.1476,1.1649,0.4312,3.2454,2.7496,1.5489,2.1943,0.215,4.407,2.227,0.5802,6.0624,0.3436,0.6725,0.2916,1.0953,1.8918,5.4328,0.4453,4.2933,1.0986,2.793,4.1009,3.176,2.7299,3.0446,0.6911,1.0146,2.3731,0.479,1.173,1.3933,1.2787,4.7217,0.4937,3.2125,0.944,2.8692,1.5241,1.2375,4.0905,1.7836,1.7896,0.658,4.3357,5.1632,0.5948,5.8264,0.3635,0.1139,1.0631,0.7795,1.179,2.0781,2.4608,0.7001,2.5144,1.0391,1.9109,4.0229,1.6365,1.8644,3.5911,3.3399,1.865,0.7188,1.1598,3.4388,4.0188,0.1442,2.3791,4.5824,3.0668,3.1154,5.9558,1.7204,1.3862,0.9416,3.3147,3.5161,5.7662,1.0171,2.7945,0.548,1.7329,0.8599,6.4324,0.0348,0.5414,1.3681,3.3393,0.9508,0.7563,0.2372,0.1002,8.3011,5.2239,4.6584,1.5655,5.2773,5.0872,1.1973,0.6569,0.6552,3.0993,4.1319,1.3155,5.5436,2.1019,1.0204,0.9122,2.3027,8.4139,4.3283,4.0443,0.2318,2.0905,4.3307,2.4281,3.0647,2.7698,2.2617,1.5792,3.1517,4.5706,2.624,1.4444,0.7606,2.5384,1.505,0.7255,0.0955,6.5655,2.368,5.3536,6.2646,6.0164,2.2971,0.3833,0.5341,2.808,1.8635,3.2367,2.0547,0.991,0.5129,0.1345,0.4765,0.2777,4.6737,0.8436,1.5857,4.6364,0.9032,0.5528,1.7203,2.5244,4.0338,0.7066,2.1225,3.0979,1.5978,1.2221,1.0219,0.3088,0.3718,0.6666,3.1001,4.5167,1.9107,5.4249,1.8276,5.1531,2.8841,3.8656,0.0003,0.4853,5.733,0.5268,1.4858,4.5798,2.7913,5.6194,3.9857,2.3971,3.1006,0.1167,3.0189,0.6901,4.9667,0.6683,5.2585]}

This coating is passivated by chromate salts. A limitation of cadmium electroplating is that it is difficult to achieve accurate, fast and strong adsorption because of the lower surface area for electroplating.\n\nThe new process that allows the direct conversion of graphene oxide into carbides is based on two main steps. First, the researchers produced graphene oxide and reduced it to a bare carbon in an electrochemical process, thereby converting it to a reduced graphene oxide. The method is called electrochemical reduction (or CNR). On the other hand, the researchers reduced the graphene oxide with a catalyst on a substrate surface, forming carbides, with an efficiency of 85 %.\n\nIt is now possible to make transparent devices, such as solar cells, graphene conductors, solar cells with high conductivity and even solar cells based on carbon nanotubes and carbon nanotubes-nanotube composite.\n\nThis new technique has been designed to exploit the high surface area of the carbon nanotubes. Based on the principle of \"carbon nanotubes on carbon\", the new technique allows the construction of devices based on the CNT-infrastructure. The CNT-infrastructure enables the formation of the various carbon architectures: covalently linked nanotube layers, carbon nanotubes as conductors and graphene-like carbon nanotube networks. This is done by the direct synthesis of CNT-infrastructure on graphene, following that the CNT is grown on the graphene.\n\nThe researchers are currently optimizing the graphene oxide adsorption capability of the new approach using a series of optimization experiments. The team is aiming to reduce the surface area of the carbon nanotubes to at least 50 percent, which is in the range of the conventional graphene oxide adsorption capacity (as high as 80 percent for monolayer networks).\n\nExplore further: Carbon nanotubes could make solar cells more efficient\n\nMore information: An Electrochemical Reduction of Graphene Oxide for Graphene Conductors, Science Express, science.sciencemag.org\/content\/1\/9\/e1600412","token_len":462,"entropy":[6.9015,3.0776,0.0005,10.3191,0.6902,0.113,2.4993,11.6088,6.0899,6.8252,0.3139,0.4139,5.9291,2.3481,1.9254,1.3516,2.5015,1.13,1.1288,7.6082,1.2424,13.4927,3.1438,2.2786,3.9853,3.0202,1.2122,3.3315,6.3929,1.0768,11.685,0.0849,1.3712,4.5232,3.2041,3.5201,1.8467,4.2781,8.4014,0.3353,2.5761,0.0004,0.0011,0.3587,0.0045,0.0136,0.1607,0.7178,0.8267,1.2058,3.3356,0.0692,2.6542,6.1241,3.4576,4.9081,1.1052,5.7403,5.9393,0.0074,0.0195,3.9132,0.4464,0.7269,5.8493,1.6647,0.8098,4.0489,4.5786,0.611,0.0206,0.7989,1.632,0.0032,2.3474,4.3858,2.8463,5.469,4.7142,1.8952,3.7076,3.0944,0.0872,5.5835,0.7676,1.2048,6.0934,0.8155,1.6031,2.1633,0.0165,4.1135,3.3334,1.1509,0.9509,0.7552,0.1473,1.0219,5.3122,4.2762,1.9466,0.1419,3.4498,3.8451,0.617,0.7742,2.2687,5.7468,1.5409,4.4454,2.3454,2.2903,0.2851,1.8301,2.3639,4.6109,2.9016,1.2692,1.312,2.1252,5.4778,0.5108,0.0169,0.864,1.6162,6.3208,1.4014,3.3005,1.4218,0.6288,0.6548,2.7862,5.4857,4.3607,2.2834,0.5852,6.6941,0.3518,0.4985,0.0277,0.0105,0.9659,1.0655,2.8455,0.8782,1.3591,0.0322,3.2356,1.5825,1.4443,5.296,0.9424,1.5214,4.7849,1.3985,3.4322,1.1311,0.3042,2.5618,4.6996,2.6912,1.9271,0.2364,3.4773,0.3452,0.3857,0.9549,0.0002,5.5205,0.618,4.24,0.401,0.0475,3.2641,5.8276,5.8404,2.6299,1.2534,0.0026,1.4145,0.0954,0.5565,5.9791,5.7951,0.1602,0.8118,3.1936,2.1317,1.1607,1.8626,3.816,0.1044,1.0514,4.2166,2.1997,1.2651,4.274,0.0098,2.1201,0.2612,0.0232,0.0408,2.9219,1.5428,0.2431,0.061,0.7346,0.9324,4.8557,0.1738,0.0798,1.3353,1.1597,1.0362,0.0002,3.4789,2.4475,2.7831,2.5052,1.9786,4.5111,0.8296,4.9467,0.3294,2.7094,1.6086,0.1916,0.2959,1.9595,1.5184,0.7975,0.0381,0.124,1.9092,5.6496,0.0044,0.9094,4.8194,0.1581,3.6923,4.2588,0.8603,0.0605,1.1443,3.1056,1.2044,1.3924,0.6233,3.1418,1.4903,1.9237,0.7334,5.7555,0.0146,3.4284,3.0499,0.0114,2.2077,4.1705,0.2625,2.5536,5.753,5.943,1.3563,1.5617,2.0194,0.0188,0.3812,0.0566,0.0141,3.8367,0.5437,2.4449,0.0201,3.0042,5.8984,2.8253,5.3025,3.9468,5.0177,0.5554,0.8948,2.3455,2.474,0.0633,2.8667,4.4625,0.4116,3.1743,0.1702,0.0523,0.7225,4.2636,3.7081,0.1489,1.5764,2.7926,2.4122,1.2204,1.3027,1.1325,0.0447,2.7317,3.5861,0.3775,3.259,2.5585,4.9896,0.6158,2.0487,2.3858,5.0476,0.1694,1.6999,0.0098,1.0557,0.4343,0.1254,1.8715,1.3126,2.1769,5.903,6.6826,0.8728,1.1161,0.0062,3.2139,2.6347,0.4582,1.0115,0.4514,1.5217,0.6731,0.0002,1.242,1.5006,2.7142,1.8987,5.563,0.1566,4.4838,1.5787,3.9489,0.1616,0.0175,4.3254,1.3768,0.3929,1.6885,4.6537,4.5788,1.7959,3.9746,0.0029,4.4687,0.9513,0.5379,1.5244,3.707,0.7718,4.1844,0.4111,3.2443,0.1009,3.1824,0.1375,0.4223,0.4197,2.0922,0.0891,0.0058,0.0719,1.4572,4.9093,0.0332,2.8963,3.3198,1.2077,1.508,1.2633,4.564,1.5294,0.3723,0.1012,1.0596,5.3336,2.2984,0.9292,1.3756,0.0879,0.0421,2.3967,4.1099,5.4767,1.8866,0.012,1.8878,1.2079,2.7229,5.9289,0.3235,0.2984,6.493,0.4125,0.9401,0.0002,1.3153,0.0001,0.0007,4.3864,0.2098,0.0209,0.603,2.5305,2.9446,0.9208,0.3636,1.161,0.1938,0.5189,0.0002,0.0007,0.0,0.0,5.2028,5.4004,0.0926,0.3164,0.3064,0.6622,0.0019,0.0006,0.0232,0.0125,3.7331,3.8959,0.0023,0.0005,2.2531,0.1225,0.743,2.2734,2.8423,0.2144,2.9499,0.1288,0.001,0.0,0.0006,0.0,0.0026,2.5179,0.0056,0.921,0.0227,2.2421,0.0113,0.0057,1.057,3.6479,4.0509]}
{"id":1589,"ended":false,"length":430,"gen_text":"A tropical wave moved off the northwestern coast of Africa on August 16. The wave moved west through the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without significant development. The wave moved across Central America and Mexico over the ensuing weeks and is now moving across southern United States.\n\nThe wave is estimated to have been between 13 feet and 26 feet in height, and to have moved at about 12 mph. The wave is forecast to move eastward over the Caribbean during next 48 hours after coming ashore. The strongest winds will be in the west-northwest near where the wave originated from. The heaviest precipitation amounts are in the western Caribbean and West Indies. This track will bring the strongest tropical weather to the US and Mexico with coastal flooding. Rainfall totals are likely to top 10 inches across the areas of heaviest precipitation along the route southward.\n\nMeteorologists have been watching a tropical disturbance in the North Atlantic since this morning, August 14, when it began weakening. The track of the disturbance has shifted from the north, where it was previously focused, and north-northwesterly so far during the second half of the overnight period. The disturbance has moved slightly closer to the North American West Coast and should now be located a few miles north of the Cape Verde Islands (about 45-50 nautical miles away). The track continues to shift rightward, which will increase the likelihood of the disturbance making landfall along the northern border of Canada and the United States. The extent and strength of the disturbance is still unknown.\n\nWidespread flooding in coastal areas due to tropical moisture as well as coastal erosion are expected in the wake of this disturbance and will likely last for several more days.\n\nThis is the second significant wave of moisture to strike the US over the past several days, as Tropical Storm Joaquin spawned an intense storm surge that flooded coastal areas in the Caribbean. The storm surge inundated many areas along the eastern Atlantic coastline, including the city of St. Maarten on Tuesday, August 26. Joaquin was the strongest storm in the western Atlantic since 2005 and the second strongest storm in the contiguous US since at least 1916. The National Hurricane Center said that damage, damages, and loss of life were primarily caused by the storm surge.\n\n(MORE: Hurricane Joaquin: The Best Photos )","token_len":464,"entropy":[10.2496,6.0238,5.6564,4.3443,0.381,6.0008,0.2418,0.0798,2.8083,2.0174,4.2388,3.6884,1.8427,1.4794,2.4937,5.0713,3.1731,4.9315,0.2801,2.4746,0.5035,1.1254,5.8882,0.102,7.9654,4.6519,5.1438,0.9912,1.7031,1.4257,5.3079,3.7891,5.5387,0.4232,1.1377,1.2742,4.6944,0.3527,5.7312,2.6371,2.1038,2.5525,0.8425,1.6954,2.9086,5.2969,4.1442,0.008,0.4965,1.3348,0.0011,1.3953,2.474,1.2898,4.7978,0.0388,1.0187,2.9827,2.6824,4.7476,3.3586,0.3402,4.2707,0.0063,1.2458,0.1553,1.8239,1.4398,4.0597,0.0563,3.3373,1.8366,2.4596,3.2089,0.7209,0.295,1.5852,1.0333,1.4495,3.5878,0.0115,2.6285,2.7881,0.9196,2.2002,0.2206,3.7763,5.9638,3.4869,3.6772,0.1763,7.3471,6.2635,0.4253,2.8342,1.6409,5.245,0.8614,2.7095,0.9123,1.7251,0.2536,4.4065,1.7454,0.7497,0.0083,3.0741,6.4306,0.1128,0.1358,2.4146,3.2492,0.4674,1.713,4.3674,3.0362,4.6535,0.7519,2.9805,0.344,2.8502,0.7471,1.1713,6.0917,0.1155,0.6679,4.513,6.6672,1.7783,2.1855,1.0885,1.9024,3.4111,3.7105,0.8985,0.6285,4.6734,3.2008,2.2849,4.1123,5.4657,0.3385,2.5908,5.168,0.3091,2.2322,2.0594,2.0469,0.072,4.7249,2.4512,0.1053,2.5906,0.8665,4.8353,1.7785,2.809,1.5872,4.1296,0.2015,5.6357,6.8957,0.7075,1.033,0.7273,0.0002,5.137,0.0135,0.2076,2.7411,2.0535,2.1626,4.0804,1.1195,2.0997,2.2238,0.0402,2.3012,0.0785,1.6554,5.1466,1.2876,1.9021,4.6306,1.9108,1.6951,1.1057,0.7627,2.2839,4.9009,0.8055,0.9968,4.714,0.5329,0.388,0.3589,1.4139,1.5541,3.3666,1.438,3.1919,2.9695,1.8748,0.1647,1.1784,3.8952,6.3045,0.0845,3.5675,5.0252,1.3842,1.1141,3.5568,0.0018,0.0028,6.1453,1.4595,4.0395,0.4792,5.5416,0.9676,0.0061,0.5819,6.138,2.6285,0.2059,1.1718,1.3953,1.9072,2.6861,3.7708,3.5106,0.0318,0.2649,2.537,0.5944,3.9414,0.0285,1.9603,4.716,3.2121,1.4947,2.1962,4.9937,1.0913,3.6837,1.789,0.2894,0.8233,3.9229,0.1057,0.0025,0.0867,4.8819,3.1166,5.1573,2.8865,0.9656,1.3226,0.042,0.0057,3.5926,0.7124,1.391,2.4848,4.7262,0.0612,0.9342,5.5643,0.278,1.8598,3.4355,1.5013,2.7674,0.1923,1.6172,0.3078,2.3051,0.3473,3.6411,0.5243,2.3334,0.1032,3.6822,5.1972,0.1402,4.105,1.3285,0.1066,1.1508,0.0048,0.3704,1.7578,5.3382,2.5053,1.7468,0.0178,0.4092,0.7813,1.5727,0.8869,1.9787,0.9539,0.5172,0.0002,5.9449,1.4957,2.647,3.141,3.8898,0.4594,6.2138,0.0064,2.4343,2.3488,5.8964,1.8306,0.0085,4.575,1.8942,2.1663,1.0883,2.1288,0.4902,3.8727,0.0033,0.7305,0.5803,4.2162,2.4906,1.3774,2.3203,1.2369,0.5561,2.7768,0.075,0.2266,1.594,0.0002,3.8529,1.3924,1.1178,1.5321,4.1472,3.5157,0.8119,3.8342,1.5984,3.5569,0.2894,1.6403,3.3115,0.0545,0.6985,2.3129,0.1193,2.371,2.8493,3.1375,0.2184,4.4136,0.0103,5.0041,3.6471,2.1716,2.0634,0.9346,2.5464,2.2066,2.4109,0.4293,1.5386,1.1933,2.4123,1.2238,1.7089,1.6334,0.3175,2.711,0.006,3.4409,2.247,2.2973,0.1126,2.8375,5.0885,2.8422,0.9877,0.8833,1.4897,4.2762,0.0124,3.0184,0.0477,1.3192,0.0041,3.0596,5.4982,1.1553,0.0822,5.512,0.2376,3.9749,0.0011,2.0003,1.8491,1.5661,1.2613,2.3273,0.3451,4.3182,0.3263,1.85,3.5188,1.5695,1.2135,1.9118,0.6417,0.9559,1.1949,0.1474,5.7716,1.2557,0.9287,2.9169,0.0017,4.9811,0.2107,2.1067,2.9986,0.1683,0.0016,2.6466,1.2716,5.5272,5.0984,5.9433,0.3103,0.3819,1.3264,0.0122,0.0234,1.583,5.888,1.6902,0.0246,1.2494,0.5215,0.0336,0.7077,0.7417,0.0002,3.9335,0.7202,0.0045,1.2116,0.3615,0.0008,1.9942,3.4382,3.8636,1.1261,1.2616]}

A schedule 9 drug is outlined in the Poisons Act 1964 as `` Substances which are dangerous drugs for human use and which have not been generally accepted as medicines by specialists in pharmacology or as therapeutics for human use''.\n\nThis means that the use of S. divinorum could result in life-long medical problems for users due to its toxicity.\n\nDespite this, the FDA approved this substance, and the Australian authorities have still refused to consider that this particular psychoactive shrub has therapeutic value or that it should be legalised.\n\nIn the United States the legalisation process for Khat (also known as Khat) has been fraught with difficulty, with a number of countries including Australia refusing to adopt any ban, warning that it would be the same as legalisation.\n\nDespite this, several companies have produced new varieties of Khat that are claimed to have fewer undesirable effects, and there have been a number of studies confirming that these have therapeutic benefits.\n\nAt present it is illegal to produce, distribute, sell or import in Australia. Despite this, many countries have already adopted a number of restrictions.\n\nWe encourage your members to contact your members of parliament urging them to help remove the ban on this plant, which is currently on Schedule 9.\n\nThe Australian government recently said that 'the science has not supported any link between human health harms and traditional use of Khat.' [2] At present, S. divinorum is also prohibited in the UK and Netherlands, but this could change.\n\nThis petition is in no way implying that Khat itself is safe and effective. The plant is known to cause significant and undesirable harm in the human body, and there is little evidence that it is in any way beneficial or safe.\n\nGiven the lack of evidence to date, it's extremely disappointing that we have allowed the ban on Khat to stand for so long.\n\n[1] http:\/\/www.legislation.gov.au\/Details\/Details.aspx?id=201203240123\n\n[2] www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/technology-24251625","token_len":464,"entropy":[7.044,0.861,0.0012,0.0004,2.5622,4.6052,1.1612,3.1211,7.7161,6.6522,6.3034,1.2865,5.5793,4.1461,0.2326,4.0888,0.0003,1.5651,1.6897,12.8755,3.2503,1.6775,4.5654,6.7804,0.0897,3.2234,0.5797,9.0719,0.7146,0.4672,2.1213,0.0001,3.1541,7.4491,2.1665,9.273,10.8963,0.0003,1.8995,0.8941,2.0688,4.0363,3.8207,0.3334,1.6571,1.5228,1.2803,1.8002,2.6927,0.2594,4.649,0.5231,0.6023,3.3403,3.4133,5.1267,0.1669,3.2888,0.0291,1.8031,1.4815,2.919,0.1643,0.7108,0.2799,0.1443,1.4897,1.7097,0.0194,3.9429,2.2455,0.288,1.6631,2.9439,0.1669,2.6477,0.1143,0.0007,0.0012,0.0007,4.9671,1.7272,0.0034,4.3959,0.3435,2.7663,2.915,2.2634,1.6257,1.9086,4.19,0.0065,1.0344,4.5919,0.9154,1.4634,0.0002,5.3422,1.1128,0.4144,1.6573,5.566,2.2557,4.3834,2.8762,4.0068,2.2038,2.2852,2.15,4.244,1.5108,5.308,3.2885,0.1157,3.6635,4.22,2.1883,6.132,4.2307,0.0045,6.7407,0.0019,2.1643,3.5361,0.7833,3.7702,1.7061,0.5476,1.5147,0.3135,2.2583,0.3046,0.5128,0.3578,0.0002,2.7891,1.8422,1.8331,0.1607,3.9291,3.8048,2.0075,2.813,1.4114,5.0365,3.3856,2.0046,1.7691,0.1563,0.0182,4.1386,0.3332,1.7844,1.0657,0.5662,3.1826,0.0338,2.9896,1.5231,1.1868,2.9749,1.0599,0.0019,3.1525,3.6237,1.5173,1.7354,0.0671,5.6722,3.3066,3.463,3.2474,6.4354,1.0481,1.524,1.6148,1.5455,4.642,4.1415,0.2908,2.5123,2.8559,0.727,0.4067,0.0002,3.7579,0.8732,0.2477,4.7014,4.3424,0.873,3.9252,4.5285,2.5239,0.0784,0.4833,0.0036,1.9221,0.9822,3.5717,0.03,1.427,2.3637,5.5699,0.6652,1.6964,1.3033,3.9741,1.792,0.2413,2.5153,0.1466,0.0077,2.6453,4.6938,1.3672,1.9131,3.7874,3.0467,1.6805,0.392,0.172,0.0002,5.4289,1.3616,3.0969,0.2447,1.6181,0.2832,1.5553,1.4938,2.9784,0.7288,1.7671,0.5558,0.9236,3.4221,0.4541,2.855,5.0285,0.2809,0.2967,3.7863,3.4372,1.5768,3.6574,3.0647,2.0785,3.5074,0.0025,2.9428,2.7811,0.3997,0.0002,5.3961,5.0621,4.5193,4.5582,0.1702,1.3181,1.8666,4.3022,0.1434,0.6323,5.5662,0.1367,0.027,5.4044,4.2541,1.2584,1.4856,0.3496,2.2535,1.571,1.696,2.2131,1.0178,2.5436,3.7625,2.6903,0.8328,1.3022,0.5402,0.0002,3.2767,2.8252,1.3004,5.2617,4.866,0.6456,6.6904,2.5602,3.4228,3.4618,0.6399,3.1136,2.8374,2.3204,0.1135,5.749,3.173,4.8321,0.4426,5.3376,1.2419,0.1851,1.3843,0.1069,3.6762,5.4875,2.7954,0.1095,6.8413,1.086,1.3774,3.6563,0.0654,0.0057,0.0015,0.0014,0.4589,4.1861,3.4904,0.3927,0.96,1.9838,1.4764,5.6284,1.748,2.2415,2.5332,3.0821,0.7795,1.4406,0.2731,0.0002,3.9371,1.6644,1.153,3.7,3.2019,0.0088,5.6595,0.2893,1.949,0.0143,3.7586,0.4197,1.9679,3.498,2.021,0.9738,2.7677,2.9579,0.8989,3.1306,0.0943,1.375,3.9963,4.0653,4.9081,5.6895,2.6297,1.7786,1.1414,0.0575,0.8178,0.6274,2.5032,0.72,3.4102,0.8761,0.7869,0.4095,1.3997,5.1124,0.4659,0.0319,1.1391,2.7551,1.2995,0.6544,0.3628,0.0002,5.6238,0.7201,2.506,0.0024,0.7749,2.4492,3.628,0.4585,1.8523,3.5164,4.2333,2.2488,0.109,4.3938,1.3214,5.5948,1.4693,2.6042,0.4634,1.4268,0.0022,0.1924,1.7406,0.8814,0.6013,0.0985,0.2947,0.604,0.0002,3.4267,0.0497,0.0118,0.8427,0.0007,0.2481,0.0052,5.2257,0.0265,0.037,0.0019,0.0157,0.0278,0.0428,0.0126,0.3231,0.0432,3.9154,1.956,0.0214,0.0043,0.9979,0.0011,5.2916,4.763,2.846,4.0494,4.7127,1.5278,0.0002,0.0197,0.0091,0.0015,4.8635,0.0023,5.3795,0.0237,0.0018,0.2859,0.0016,0.0005,0.0516,0.0326,0.0037,3.7319,0.0002,3.0829,4.443,4.2436,4.4615]}

{"id":4564,"ended":false,"length":435,"gen_text":"The Valdez Marine Terminal, the southern end of the pipeline, was planned for a site across the Port Valdez fjord from Valdez proper. Initial studies predicted bedrock would be six feet below sea level in the area in the year 2035. But the actual site has been reduced because of the lower level of the fjord and reduced traffic flow, and the water levels at the site may drop much lower. In addition, the pipeline has lost four of eleven sections. Two of those have been replaced.\n\nThe project is on hold, and the National Transportation Safety Board and Alaska EPA were investigating the incident. The pipeline company has stopped work. On January 4, 2015, the President of US Enviroforsight said that the pipeline company will work with FERC to investigate what happened, including:\n\nThe pipeline company's \"safety planning process\" and a technical review of the pipeline was provided with the NEPA process, but it appears to have been inadequate considering the history of pipelines. In its previous decade of operation, the Valdez pipeline experienced five oil spills, resulting in more than 100,000 gallons of oil spilled, leaking through a portion of the pipeline. In 2015 alone, the pipeline spilled more than 3,000 barrels of oil in 24 incidents (including an entire mile of the pipeline where the spill was discovered by emergency responders). The incident was so severe that the National Guard had to be called in.\n\nAs we point out in The Guardian, despite the huge increase in oil operations in the Arctic Ocean over the past two decades due to offshore drilling as well as the increasing size of the market, the pipeline will require a minimum length of 2,150 miles to carry the same amount of oil, and only one mile would be required to store the stored oil. So this \"safety\" measure is simply a way to allow the company to delay a shutdown of the pipeline for a year or two, in anticipation of another disaster. At this point, the fact that this pipeline could be shutdown for a year or two at a time for reasons that have never even been explained should be reason enough for any responsible person to be skeptical about the pipeline's safety, because not even the company itself can be trusted to get things right.\n\n(h\/t to The Guardian)","token_len":466,"entropy":[12.5329,1.3389,6.4652,3.2094,1.8926,2.9472,5.8117,3.524,0.0157,0.3575,4.6142,0.5528,2.2132,5.4062,1.7526,1.9037,1.3967,4.5003,0.6551,5.7701,5.9732,0.0,8.3473,0.1738,0.0049,1.7159,3.3981,0.0007,7.9523,0.634,7.8724,4.7294,4.482,15.7451,4.5581,1.0777,8.0416,0.8184,1.2844,1.6049,0.0253,2.3261,0.6705,1.2843,4.7582,1.6165,4.8971,0.827,1.8487,0.7846,2.4023,1.7119,5.1601,2.844,2.6816,0.8846,3.013,4.6286,0.492,1.7178,4.9647,3.9479,0.2454,0.7796,1.0339,0.0007,0.012,1.8228,5.9573,5.1894,3.6326,2.2043,2.8343,1.3109,5.1506,3.3476,3.9601,0.3454,2.5646,4.2981,3.4312,4.1036,0.7728,1.341,3.4218,1.5479,0.0667,0.9945,2.119,2.1803,5.1925,5.6685,2.263,6.8097,3.7818,2.5726,4.6064,1.1045,1.7203,2.6122,0.5046,1.2942,1.8942,1.3221,0.0009,1.3453,3.3197,1.7018,3.9318,0.545,2.4356,1.597,1.2102,5.3674,2.7098,0.0228,0.0031,3.7357,4.1098,4.9149,5.324,2.422,0.7966,2.9505,0.4172,1.6463,1.5221,2.7152,2.3805,5.2499,2.1776,3.1292,5.7209,3.0269,3.5865,0.1907,2.5753,0.1888,0.7471,4.7902,1.6358,6.631,4.8221,0.2606,0.0254,4.17,0.9747,5.8285,3.7653,1.3677,0.9311,1.0608,2.5763,2.5491,4.2602,0.5086,5.7622,0.1211,0.5839,3.7882,3.2117,0.629,2.0156,3.4023,5.7912,0.6008,0.0003,2.686,3.1718,1.3938,1.1914,4.6577,4.6759,5.5786,1.9885,0.9567,2.0525,4.5144,5.6588,1.2783,0.6016,0.4164,0.9897,4.3832,5.9385,5.17,1.3581,3.9269,1.3895,1.9855,2.1035,1.9952,2.6907,3.2762,2.4103,0.3376,0.5659,2.0361,6.0237,0.3723,5.1493,0.0882,5.4538,3.0554,3.7342,4.1734,5.0459,4.9643,0.3528,0.3283,0.1562,0.5441,2.2628,0.0003,1.0931,1.7241,3.6864,4.3399,0.2011,1.2894,3.4616,0.0063,2.6157,0.0102,3.2116,0.8269,0.0042,0.4006,0.0848,0.3234,1.014,2.0632,5.3682,3.0477,2.4797,5.3483,0.0265,0.228,0.2653,1.6864,2.3923,4.3117,1.3445,0.0644,0.9042,0.6323,0.7222,1.2466,0.0257,3.4474,0.2109,0.8331,1.8803,0.2337,0.1524,2.9329,5.6393,5.4235,4.3287,2.15,4.0164,5.9018,4.8664,0.5887,1.1224,0.1488,5.3968,1.436,1.4644,0.9639,2.9402,3.1532,5.6381,0.1968,0.6442,2.0521,5.6757,2.9566,4.0742,1.9338,0.2157,1.2882,3.5403,1.1524,1.866,0.0261,0.2966,0.4381,0.3844,1.5601,0.7411,0.0002,4.3778,3.3514,6.4934,0.0025,0.5182,5.0402,4.856,0.3102,6.0067,0.8989,5.5614,4.7652,0.0721,1.2383,6.4665,0.8854,0.6826,1.5764,4.2649,2.9007,0.0463,0.6023,2.7352,0.0884,4.9193,0.0316,5.8289,0.1667,6.056,0.1814,0.0099,1.1999,3.8583,5.1442,0.21,0.6707,5.7778,0.7966,1.0802,3.4782,3.5103,6.2152,2.0233,4.8783,5.9975,0.0218,3.1438,0.0368,4.8439,0.1515,1.4348,2.4454,1.0777,2.5485,0.3242,0.0118,0.1437,3.9094,1.9836,4.1801,2.3734,2.4317,4.6273,0.4438,1.9674,1.32,5.4814,0.7135,6.8475,0.0906,0.8173,4.4215,3.2253,4.5342,3.5819,0.8645,1.8654,1.229,3.8227,1.0904,2.283,0.4744,3.308,1.1185,1.5997,0.0986,4.6466,3.0666,4.4182,0.6714,0.1847,0.1725,2.1614,1.4398,1.4577,1.3249,0.8325,1.6349,3.6319,4.19,0.1986,3.9742,3.0228,0.5548,6.0913,2.2558,0.2947,0.3051,1.2678,5.533,0.0813,2.2969,1.4637,3.8622,1.5275,5.2522,1.3967,0.9789,0.2201,0.5267,0.2659,3.82,1.4402,0.723,3.4944,3.9646,1.8089,1.2745,4.5829,3.7215,0.0322,1.903,4.0974,0.9022,2.9124,0.0574,1.0046,4.2061,2.1263,1.5839,0.0696,2.1179,2.2017,1.6047,0.7381,2.3941,0.905,0.2381,2.7918,5.0889,6.0317,2.5866,0.7142,1.6818,2.4775,1.7003,1.5507,0.1693,0.5088,4.906,2.7474,0.0958,0.3362,0.475,0.0002,4.5345,2.7928,0.0047,0.0001,1.8482,3.3549,0.5598,0.2556]}

At first, these mollusc species were thought to be the only group on the planet that had such a form of pair-bond behaviour as they had never been found elsewhere.\n\nThe new species discovered will be described next month in the journal Current Biology (and you can find their images and details by clicking here).\n\nThe scientists are now working to define how long jumping is expected to take, considering the speed of the newly classified hippocrepid molluscs, considering that they are living in such different habitats.\n\nExplore further: Scientists find first sea sponge with'suitable mate selection'\n\nMore information: Journal of Fish Biology, ISSN 0627-8080; DOI 10.1111\/jfb.12103\n\nJournal of Evolutionary Biology, dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/jevo.12426","token_len":468,"entropy":[12.0428,10.1612,5.2712,0.5272,4.325,2.379,13.6722,0.2026,13.2266,0.0088,3.5187,10.674,11.9991,4.0674,5.0481,15.0435,4.858,0.2834,2.3055,10.9334,1.6274,1.8335,7.934,3.7837,5.826,4.0874,0.2174,0.1424,5.5803,7.0866,5.6944,2.1604,1.7685,2.7645,4.0016,12.6817,5.3138,4.678,1.4932,0.8693,3.0615,4.7694,2.864,2.611,4.0392,2.7929,1.894,1.2455,4.0634,0.7914,3.1789,2.8554,0.809,5.3132,2.6996,5.2627,2.2296,4.9869,1.6651,1.2562,4.5021,1.7856,5.3416,2.6198,5.3326,2.6414,1.4251,1.0077,0.3874,4.8399,5.0817,1.5171,0.5827,2.2254,4.2232,1.1068,2.1057,0.0177,1.3196,0.2475,1.8205,6.4143,2.7026,3.5973,0.66,3.9444,4.3498,0.0858,0.0487,2.7926,5.2636,0.6908,3.2937,4.5002,2.6267,0.7662,5.2812,1.022,1.2023,0.0646,0.0049,0.1281,5.3334,5.3679,3.4579,4.6696,3.8378,2.1912,2.6584,1.7587,5.0543,1.1252,0.045,1.859,4.2562,0.0135,4.697,4.6914,0.3801,5.8178,3.7281,4.4546,2.5118,3.2589,0.829,0.0014,0.0024,0.0337,0.0504,4.3245,4.4468,4.8163,0.0343,3.0737,3.0029,2.4515,1.5215,3.9074,0.0086,0.0081,0.7969,4.1645,5.5046,5.9866,5.7449,3.7573,1.1925,4.7675,1.4381,0.7461,3.5202,1.124,0.3637,7.7373,1.7693,4.224,6.0195,1.2329,0.74,3.3042,1.4155,5.654,3.759,6.0103,3.0016,5.0161,2.4497,0.761,0.7677,4.5383,1.1377,5.7319,0.7916,0.3924,4.8283,4.1661,0.0053,1.0741,5.3772,1.9949,3.7147,4.6201,6.4093,4.6005,0.5208,0.3438,3.9646,1.3448,1.6344,4.5942,2.2106,1.7967,0.0487,3.8549,0.6206,4.1385,2.6228,2.6197,3.6233,1.5572,0.1675,0.0203,0.3006,3.0104,2.7349,2.3447,2.6117,2.4871,2.6013,1.2382,0.0023,2.6316,0.0687,0.39,0.5207,0.0003,1.4107,1.7893,0.3641,3.128,0.3916,3.8131,1.4434,3.8947,1.0067,2.7448,1.5264,5.3565,0.8116,1.1988,3.7041,4.9175,0.0168,3.4159,0.0225,0.0006,0.97,3.1862,1.6092,0.2261,1.8701,0.8645,0.0058,0.0013,1.2361,3.1111,1.3569,2.7291,3.4799,0.5877,3.3064,1.1287,1.109,2.8089,2.6468,0.9137,1.8047,0.1808,1.7432,0.3099,0.1056,2.6518,3.7884,0.8299,1.388,4.3208,2.4261,0.2715,0.8075,0.0003,4.4264,2.0475,0.5339,4.1766,0.2735,4.5437,2.5758,0.3019,1.8785,0.0249,0.0022,0.2291,0.4056,0.0011,0.1184,3.286,5.2007,0.011,2.2763,6.2056,1.5081,1.0382,3.8633,1.4753,0.0026,0.5355,0.7867,0.5064,0.6075,0.0418,0.3893,2.6866,1.847,3.9262,5.4211,0.9985,0.4751,1.1733,2.732,2.4433,0.828,4.1557,0.1295,4.5465,0.4584,0.0323,1.5152,4.9686,6.0785,2.804,3.3208,3.5235,0.1825,1.3117,2.8253,0.4608,1.378,0.0002,1.8159,0.9158,0.4247,5.2709,7.2361,0.8689,1.3587,4.481,0.7333,0.3575,0.4284,0.6482,4.0274,0.0188,3.8296,5.085,3.0211,0.0594,2.0975,3.2898,2.607,2.4399,3.3081,5.0371,0.2871,0.7694,0.2706,0.3614,0.0002,3.4103,3.8184,2.8463,1.7917,1.7619,1.0061,6.0172,2.465,3.1244,6.591,2.4411,3.9608,0.1157,1.043,1.2505,6.3243,1.3818,2.4412,1.2771,0.6471,5.6126,7.026,2.2318,0.0201,0.0057,0.1197,1.1529,0.0012,2.8086,0.0428,2.0819,5.3807,1.5569,1.8344,1.3863,5.3618,0.908,3.183,4.6605,1.5088,1.0356,0.6637,0.0002,0.334,0.0002,0.0012,3.1525,2.2075,2.8601,5.7884,4.4084,1.2095,11.0017,5.9982,7.2818,5.5,5.1273,1.7358,0.6637,0.0002,0.0009,0.0001,0.0001,5.5832,0.151,4.237,0.0098,0.5419,4.7081,0.001,5.6714,4.1893,0.0048,4.4145,3.2804,2.5939,1.2317,1.7192,0.0021,0.0483,0.0017,0.0831,0.5816,0.0017,0.829,5.8207,1.5981,0.0003,5.7581,0.0895,1.9706,0.0267,0.0244,0.1541,1.5631,0.0033,0.0004,0.0021,0.0011,0.0039,0.0342,0.0032,0.057,0.0046,0.2238,2.3553,0.7534,0.001,3.8253,3.8879]}
{"id":1093,"ended":false,"length":439,"gen_text":"A survey conducted by Minnesota's Department for Families and Children's Services shows that men consider child care to be far more important than a paycheck. Of 600 dads surveyed, a majority \u2013 52 percent \u2013 said they would be happier if their primary child care provider was a man because he would make them more involved in raising their children.\n\nWhile the majority of male providers are not transgender, the trend is clear: Men are using these spaces to better understand each other and better share experiences of raising a child.\n\nOne of the biggest differences between men and women is the presence of men and women in these spaces, said Sarah Craymer with the Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network (GLSEN).\n\n\"The issue with these spaces is that our children are there. We don't want our children to walk by our families and feel excluded,\" said Craymer.\n\nCraymer cited this as an issue that can create an unfair stereotype for parents, who may think that they will be left out, and that there is something about the parents' gender that will keep some of the other parents away.\n\n\"The reality is when these moms or dads come to these events, they have already set a great example for their children,\" she said. \"The very fact that these parents are bringing their own children to these events, it creates an atmosphere so inclusive that allows people to get to know other parents.\"\n\nAs we look to the future, gender equity in child care is a key focus of advocacy at GLSEN. When GLSEN members are planning child care events, they ask these questions:\n\nAre there groups of parents from different backgrounds that are interested in learning how to talk, be and act?\n\nIs there a space so their children don't feel like they are at the margins when they leave the event?\n\nIs there space for conversations that may not fit around gender stereotypes?\n\n\"Gender equity in child care is an issue that everyone will have to take responsibility for,\" said Craymer. \"I wish people would pay attention, understand their differences, know how important these spaces are for their families and their children, and pay attention to how they want to use these spaces.

{"id":1930,"ended":false,"length":399,"gen_text":"Only two species assigned to Iguanodon are still considered to be valid. I. bernissartensis, described by George Albert Boulenger in 1881, is the type species for the genus. This species is now considered to be inoperative for taxonomic purposes.[4] The other species, I. kamoshkii and I. bizhokuri, are the offspring of I. bernissartensis. Both species have been assigned to Iguanodon, but are not considered reliable due to a lack of evidence supporting their inferences.[4] Due to the large number of specimens for Iguanodon available, the species is often incorrectly considered as a single species. There are a variety of reasons for this, but for the purpose of this article, a list of the most commonly given explanations may be helpful: I. bernissartensis is a small species with only five species living in the wild.\n\nis a small species with only five species living in the wild. I. kamoshkii is believed to derive from the extinct.\n\nis believed to derive from the extinct. I. bizhokuri is a newly discovered and small species with only four remaining in captivity. These specimens are based solely on morphology and size, but there is no physical proof supporting their inferences to be valid.\n\nis a newly discovered and small species with only four remaining in captivity. These specimens are based solely on morphology and size, but there is no physical proof supporting their inferences to be valid. The two main differences between these two species as they share the same genus is the placement of the teeth and the lack of a posterior dorsal fin. It has also been described as a distinct species by some sources due to the lack of a posterior dorsal fin. It has also been argued that there is little physical evidence supporting the inferences to be valid, due to the small number of specimens, the fact that the specimen from China had numerous defects that led to the name being changed over several years. The only valid evidence used for the classification is the length of the body, which is considered to be the most crucial trait in the determination of taxonomy.\n\nGallery\n\nI. kamoshkii.\n\nI. bizhokuri.\n\nReferences","token_len":475,"entropy":[4.5542,7.1268,11.4333,0.4674,6.7863,2.5641,0.3241,0.1686,1.7322,2.9164,5.3069,1.568,0.2182,3.7909,2.2193,3.8919,2.8882,3.2421,2.2663,3.6599,0.4208,0.6966,1.4822,4.7691,1.0936,6.0947,7.6936,5.8309,2.4951,0.0404,0.3026,0.5282,4.2529,0.2386,1.3603,1.2929,4.8306,0.5043,1.17,1.2542,1.2872,1.672,2.9653,0.8163,1.0757,3.348,1.9487,0.7819,0.1482,3.7836,5.0699,3.9938,0.7509,0.3154,0.2589,4.7599,2.8826,0.1407,1.5958,1.13,0.6311,1.2153,0.2181,0.0568,4.4296,3.6646,4.7065,3.4656,0.0759,0.9925,0.0514,0.0016,3.1618,4.2628,3.0527,4.3096,4.7348,0.2317,0.7451,3.4546,6.1791,0.0898,1.0644,0.2471,0.1889,0.0176,0.0022,0.001,0.0009,1.7285,2.6728,1.0576,1.8633,0.5445,2.5539,0.293,0.9503,0.3429,0.0074,0.0121,2.0639,0.6294,2.3351,1.809,1.3498,5.957,3.779,0.0078,2.7994,0.707,0.0033,4.0075,2.9129,0.5849,5.2916,0.7966,1.8163,1.0834,0.192,6.6676,0.0098,0.7898,4.5812,0.9188,0.0123,2.5644,3.9911,1.5186,0.5031,0.0029,0.0015,5.0254,0.6231,1.8679,2.2019,1.4618,2.8493,3.1373,3.4297,2.1088,1.1276,0.6094,0.3326,0.9986,4.5219,0.7416,3.1401,3.5291,0.0024,2.5401,0.5099,0.3187,1.0615,2.0159,5.3457,0.7591,1.604,0.0052,0.3145,0.9489,0.5655,3.312,5.5556,0.2478,1.2758,0.8038,1.9886,3.9928,2.794,4.884,0.331,1.3502,1.2103,1.972,1.7333,0.6866,0.426,0.0018,0.0008,0.0007,1.1506,2.124,4.4865,1.7214,1.8072,2.5634,4.0614,3.2476,5.9174,0.5357,0.4641,0.9157,1.0875,1.7489,0.0024,2.8548,0.0013,0.0028,0.0011,0.0005,0.0015,0.0021,0.0027,0.0001,0.0007,0.0003,0.0005,0.0007,0.3579,0.0431,0.9309,0.0063,0.0066,0.0017,0.0007,0.6393,4.9949,0.0268,6.1563,0.2219,2.1557,4.0701,7.646,0.5243,0.0003,0.0219,0.0039,0.0006,0.0142,0.0006,0.0004,0.003,0.0059,0.1163,0.0021,0.0239,0.0007,0.002,0.0035,0.0085,0.3104,1.6799,3.5117,0.8553,4.5252,4.7244,0.4953,1.3471,0.5339,2.49,6.0794,2.3333,2.3133,0.2423,3.9329,2.0098,0.8935,5.1869,3.4317,0.0919,2.6206,0.8968,3.6835,1.4299,3.0757,3.4675,0.5235,0.6764,4.1134,4.4313,2.4154,0.673,0.7604,0.0053,4.4818,1.5144,0.4934,0.4918,0.3709,0.0002,0.0959,0.0007,0.0018,0.0003,0.0012,0.0014,0.0031,0.0003,0.0009,0.0014,0.0019,0.0005,0.0028,0.0005,0.0008,0.0001,0.001,0.0002,0.0007,0.0003,0.0007,0.0011,0.0006,0.0006,0.0015,0.0015,0.001,0.0012,0.0002,0.0004,0.0001,0.0011,0.0001,0.0007,0.0006,0.0004,0.0011,0.0006,2.0453,3.9454,5.0284,4.5713,0.1839,3.1811,0.9362,0.1684,6.7893,3.1082,5.0425,1.135,0.3129,1.4335,2.0437,1.4453,3.9942,0.042,0.2566,3.7377,1.8881,0.6096,3.2464,0.007,1.0214,4.7135,2.8047,0.8284,0.332,3.6663,1.8304,2.5819,0.0237,6.7478,1.205,1.774,4.757,0.3647,2.1481,1.2559,4.5371,3.903,0.0148,1.0273,2.1397,0.0039,1.8299,2.252,0.0649,0.0046,0.9357,3.6029,1.6468,1.2959,0.0184,2.7973,0.1705,3.5345,0.6015,3.7232,3.2384,0.1949,0.7609,1.1174,0.5483,0.0136,1.5393,0.1343,0.0525,1.5077,2.8009,0.0425,0.4204,2.1683,0.5354,0.0165,0.1971,3.6877,2.0243,3.5382,0.0614,1.2037,3.2529,3.4768,3.2266,3.7767,5.2496,3.8443,3.447,4.3374,0.1189,1.2,5.5387,0.684,0.8905,6.9815,3.0436,0.5284,5.3455,2.6174,3.5914,2.9811,1.5961,4.7149,2.0079,1.2883,2.9986,1.3361,0.6587,4.3467,0.2639,0.1636,4.256,1.3384,1.9788,0.7184,3.655,0.4686,0.1482,1.3221,1.0371,5.5314,3.648,1.4866,2.21,2.4723,0.0304,2.3449,1.1802,0.4897,1.6213,0.0003,5.7134,1.0692,0.0002,2.6841,2.1365,1.7645,0.0197,0.007,0.0033,0.0017,2.5051,1.0654,0.0002,0.5156,0.0123,0.137,0.0516,0.003,0.0032,0.0106,0.1828,0.2052,0.0002,0.9488]}
{"id":3217,"ended":false,"length":412,"gen_text":"The Pittsburgh Pirates drafted Bonds as the sixth overall pick of the 1985 Major League Baseball draft. He joined the Prince William Pirates of the Carolina League and was named July 1985 Player of the Month for the Carolina League for hitting.412 and leading the league with 18 home runs -- he also shared second place with 13 stolen bases and 15 stolen bases for the Prince William Pirates.\n\n\nAfter the 1986 season, Bonds played for two teams in the Caribbean Series of the Texas League. In the first game before he made the jump to the majors, Bonds hit a home run that scored three runs for the Prince William Pirates. The Pirates were one win away from the league championship with Bonds batting sixth. After their Game 1 victory on July 15, 1986, Bonds hit a home run, the first of which tied the game at 3-3. Game 2, which ended up being another Pirates victory with Bonds hitting third, was the final home run of his Pirates career. His home run helped the Pirates advance to the championship game, where they would lose 4-1 to the eventual champion Montgomery Biscuits of the Gulf Coast League. His 13 stolen bases tied for the league lead in 1986. In 1987, Bonds spent some time in the Venezuelan Winter League.\n\n\nAfter he was banned from baseball in 1998, Bonds started the 1999 baseball season with the Miami Marlins. The 2000 season (the last with the Miami Marlins) marked the last time Bonds put on a major league uniform until his retirement on September 25, 2001. He retired the same day that he was arrested for violating Major League Baseball's performance enhancing drug rules -- that case was later dismissed. In 2001, Bonds hit.303 (151-for-472) with 73 runs, 21 home runs, 74 RBI, and 52 stolen bases in 154 games for the Marlins playing second base and his natural position of shortstop.\n\n\nBonds then played for the San Francisco Giants (2003-2007) and Oakland Athletics (2007-2008) before retiring in the offseason. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in his home city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on August 13, 2016.\n\n- See more at: http:\/\/www.hbengstley.com\/sports\/baseball\/baseball-fans-history.html#sthash.i6v2kMw3.dpuf","token_len":476,"entropy":[9.4128,2.7728,5.8774,9.7493,3.1585,1.633,3.4219,0.2887,0.1245,2.6183,0.0359,2.4683,2.9391,0.004,0.0673,0.9369,0.6738,1.4747,4.9419,0.2213,11.2162,2.278,5.3971,1.5898,0.0218,1.9597,0.0046,2.2948,2.2351,1.8366,9.9495,5.7337,2.8253,0.038,0.0084,0.0895,0.8517,1.2568,2.3265,0.0277,2.7171,1.2637,7.7264,16.303,5.8149,1.8647,0.1562,0.1368,0.6231,4.6217,0.4592,0.0022,7.5882,2.9754,1.3594,6.2919,4.6923,0.8938,0.8549,3.7486,1.5119,0.0017,2.0147,5.2988,2.9122,0.0081,3.9658,0.5694,3.3173,0.0771,0.2435,0.4104,4.7913,0.0002,3.3189,1.5285,2.6024,0.0592,0.1045,0.5928,3.1183,0.7671,4.0224,1.4731,0.7953,0.4153,5.6076,1.8886,3.4463,0.1377,5.6391,0.0435,0.8018,1.8013,1.3351,1.0498,0.2669,7.8314,4.4616,4.5317,1.5042,1.6077,0.0947,0.1487,0.6952,0.1265,0.9372,1.074,0.619,0.957,0.0015,3.9993,3.526,3.3501,0.2789,2.226,0.3382,2.543,0.1114,0.0647,0.6809,2.5278,0.8909,3.3654,4.2396,2.0819,0.3708,0.0038,1.1575,2.5667,0.3339,4.4582,2.4576,2.896,4.5875,1.3121,3.1493,4.9523,4.6604,1.6413,2.6682,4.5391,0.9807,3.4859,0.2561,2.1455,0.1454,0.9803,2.3753,1.1433,1.3046,0.001,3.1514,4.7053,1.0027,0.6999,5.5425,3.3089,0.1835,0.2308,0.8373,2.1249,0.2421,0.0124,0.6885,6.0847,0.1599,3.3024,1.3709,2.5498,2.7564,0.5822,4.826,1.6134,0.9924,4.4003,0.4024,1.1507,2.3192,0.3233,1.2421,2.5249,2.3857,2.7356,0.0687,0.815,0.37,3.8148,0.108,0.2505,4.3063,2.9007,0.1574,5.5437,0.7689,0.1401,2.9176,0.0868,0.085,2.0404,1.7399,1.741,0.4254,0.2379,2.5484,0.6077,3.6315,0.0101,1.51,0.4171,0.0979,4.5216,1.5033,4.8256,0.0137,0.0067,0.0359,2.0776,0.1412,3.1896,0.0047,0.0231,0.1067,5.0235,5.2586,1.1012,0.0099,2.3836,0.7908,0.6161,0.6883,0.022,3.3219,0.2781,0.5664,3.4576,0.9592,0.1136,0.6059,5.0774,4.4194,0.0697,0.9296,0.3493,4.4593,0.6262,0.0084,1.8784,2.1778,0.0002,2.5518,3.0423,0.9076,5.4993,0.4361,0.2558,1.6102,4.1966,0.8313,0.242,5.1702,4.0106,1.7347,4.4606,0.0242,0.5067,0.2408,3.873,0.0198,0.4628,3.0086,7.006,0.2868,7.1775,1.7313,1.9685,3.8372,0.5185,2.944,0.0191,0.1875,3.2605,0.99,2.1839,0.5232,0.2973,6.9187,0.5193,0.4,2.1441,0.0328,0.013,4.5035,1.6057,2.0843,1.7782,2.0263,3.7284,0.0222,1.4447,0.1163,1.5154,3.0122,4.677,1.7665,0.3597,2.4147,1.3977,1.0603,1.5273,0.8141,3.8489,0.2816,0.0001,0.0023,0.029,2.8439,0.6992,0.1563,3.101,4.8565,4.4066,5.2528,0.6409,1.0802,1.2177,0.4077,2.8923,1.2214,0.1123,0.435,2.1691,8.9543,5.413,4.8742,5.4255,0.1905,0.1072,0.0062,4.5156,0.1488,0.1787,4.8813,0.5535,1.3044,4.4877,1.7012,0.0011,0.4653,4.1921,0.0194,0.7679,1.2518,5.0587,0.087,0.0012,1.1966,2.8857,0.0146,1.2776,0.1222,0.325,8.5645,2.6005,0.03,1.2792,4.5864,2.9605,0.2096,0.9672,1.5457,0.1412,1.6218,0.0002,0.8638,0.02,4.4935,1.4627,1.0594,0.3143,2.0287,0.6769,0.004,3.0664,2.0209,0.5137,2.3465,0.521,0.2742,2.5189,0.1073,0.0236,1.2858,0.2364,1.6463,1.2615,1.1738,0.5069,2.2994,2.8749,2.0973,0.5989,1.1469,1.5151,0.8777,0.0008,0.0596,0.022,1.4247,0.0042,0.0037,0.0008,0.2354,2.9334,1.3281,2.2353,0.1087,6.4302,1.0703,0.1117,1.6233,0.503,1.9231,3.5667,0.01,2.7854,0.1253,1.7629,0.0002,1.0849,2.0788,0.1063,0.0005,0.003,0.1606,0.0005,0.3631,0.0019,4.6234,4.541,3.976,3.6117,1.7335,0.0981,0.0432,0.1235,3.5783,0.3109,0.9225,0.0065,0.1912,2.2886,0.0078,0.3788,5.3851,0.6422,0.416,4.8883,3.9088,0.6885,0.0133,0.001,0.0001,0.0033,4.2366,3.9145,4.0982,4.0219,4.319,4.6446,3.6373,3.9342,0.0059,0.0032,0.0]}

{"id":4038,"ended":true,"length":456,"gen_text":"Following the impact of `` Give Peace a Chance `` and `` Happy Xmas ( War Is Over ) ``, both strongly associated with the anti \u2013 Vietnam War movement, the Nixon administration has never since been in a mood to support liberal causes, especially the civil rights struggle. Nevertheless, the National Geographic Society and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce supported the Vietnam settlement, despite its failure to achieve complete victory on the peninsula.\nWith the Vietnam War now over, Nixon and Kissinger have largely given up on promoting the peace settlement.\nThe anti war movement has also largely lost interest in Vietnam.\nAlthough there are some indications that the Viet Cong are still capable of causing more damage to the US, the tide has clearly turned for the US since 1968.\nBy the 1970's, Vietnam was an ``untouchable`` country.\nWith the Vietnamese economy heavily dependent on the US and military expenditures declining significantly with the end of the war, it would appear that Nixon and Kissinger got the best possible deal they could, given their interests in avoiding a complete defeat to the Chinese and their desire to continue the Vietnam War.\nWhile there may still be some tensions with the Vietnamese and Americans in general regarding US relations in Southeast Asia, this has largely died down in recent years.\nThe most recent attempt to renew the war effort, through the creation of the `` Vietcong Special Forces `', has only lead to more problems than the Vietnam War.\nIn fact, the Vietnam war and the civil rights movements were the basis for the creation of `` The United States Special Forces \ufffd' '' as well as the `` Global War on Terror, `` both of which will only further marginalize the US in the region.\nIt is no secret that the Vietnam war would end up costing US taxpayers a total of $4 billion.\nToday there is little reason to believe that the Vietnam War would ever be resumed, and that Vietnam is the new China.\nIn 1971, Kissinger had estimated that the cost for the war could be over $200 billion.\nEven if the US had only one foot of water, it may still still be viable for the US to remain in the South China Sea, because of the ability to `` shift the equilibrium of the Pacific War \u00a0 in America's favor by having Washington fight alongside Asian allies without having to worry much about fighting its traditional enemy: China.","token_len":476,"entropy":[1.1467,8.2554,0.6271,13.7785,15.4519,6.4835,0.1327,0.0036,2.4853,1.8516,0.7263,7.5155,7.0188,0.1583,3.6912,11.2983,2.8267,0.2759,0.3933,2.1944,1.3691,5.0446,8.9961,5.0706,0.0712,1.2299,5.1877,13.7213,4.4976,0.3123,0.6852,0.5633,1.3418,7.8512,0.851,3.6454,5.0382,5.6169,2.44,4.1771,1.1449,3.4024,0.1884,3.2085,6.2188,0.9574,2.4311,2.8094,2.5921,2.1301,0.0376,3.3793,0.2291,5.6406,0.0439,1.4075,5.654,6.2185,1.7063,3.0831,0.7386,3.3224,0.0087,0.049,0.0049,4.6338,0.0288,0.0022,4.7121,0.6668,3.6426,5.248,1.5476,4.5598,2.3837,4.0368,0.2249,2.4949,6.2308,1.7772,4.3499,0.4203,5.5753,0.275,1.8501,9.2249,0.5964,3.6936,1.2085,2.5432,1.2929,0.3321,3.3428,2.4086,0.9897,1.3223,5.4438,3.0801,0.0961,0.7008,3.4519,2.1194,2.4373,0.296,1.1228,3.6086,1.9767,5.6081,4.7564,0.3598,1.7023,3.0111,2.5939,3.6832,2.6996,0.1113,2.8819,0.6269,2.0448,4.1962,2.4015,1.4009,2.2141,3.9339,0.2178,0.8731,5.7679,0.2398,1.5403,2.6184,3.4041,0.0088,3.9258,5.1577,1.5588,1.2802,1.1646,4.3001,1.2175,1.1044,5.6921,1.1991,2.6332,0.1016,5.3509,0.3722,2.1714,4.9496,3.5772,0.2408,0.832,5.0017,1.1847,3.65,0.9164,0.5381,3.2738,1.0149,3.8949,5.5708,4.9127,0.269,0.0003,1.3222,1.6381,1.1721,0.8302,3.9471,0.5348,4.975,2.1486,4.877,0.2885,0.1274,1.0838,0.517,2.6735,5.5759,3.3633,3.678,4.2578,4.2992,0.2868,0.4014,0.0026,0.0742,0.5513,0.1065,2.6443,3.257,2.037,0.1249,3.2787,0.3666,0.0156,5.5214,2.1328,1.2844,2.9383,0.5729,3.3789,0.0786,3.6032,2.3437,1.8332,3.7153,1.8803,3.7838,1.2259,4.7033,2.5033,4.0396,0.2726,4.9767,1.4277,2.6716,1.4619,0.1731,4.3555,1.7608,2.8328,1.0039,0.8025,0.2416,4.433,2.4671,2.7357,2.6146,0.0194,0.8688,5.7842,2.2271,0.9281,1.4436,3.9411,5.0113,2.4214,0.2678,3.7557,3.5426,4.2609,2.3021,2.6616,0.0083,0.1341,3.5647,1.8775,1.9771,3.6845,0.3785,2.2402,1.1073,0.1447,0.2861,0.2664,1.8036,4.6576,0.9489,4.0966,0.6214,4.7398,0.7833,2.0847,2.5121,2.3647,4.2759,0.7662,4.5777,0.0193,0.7921,1.0196,3.0846,1.688,5.7228,0.1886,3.6772,1.3081,1.4822,4.8342,6.0228,0.0379,1.3514,2.5306,3.1906,2.8341,2.3997,0.4147,2.1915,0.335,2.7346,3.183,0.0549,1.0584,2.4839,2.2995,3.9319,0.7374,5.8192,0.2085,3.709,3.1377,2.6913,5.8797,0.529,0.6887,1.645,0.0256,4.3133,3.8073,3.6695,0.2071,1.6303,0.3806,5.0624,2.2782,2.2546,3.7211,0.9974,0.071,0.6647,1.9369,3.7317,0.0865,0.0655,1.5172,4.3545,1.1123,1.7178,0.4106,0.0083,5.2213,4.7637,2.0206,4.9923,0.0288,0.4131,1.3331,1.3147,0.5957,1.5853,0.2579,0.1684,3.6084,0.7747,4.153,1.9086,0.065,0.656,2.5027,1.4065,6.0727,5.4038,1.8272,0.8414,4.342,0.0971,2.4212,2.2191,0.0256,0.7872,2.1958,2.0687,2.1341,0.5757,5.6429,4.3102,1.0924,1.9073,2.7354,0.2202,1.2879,0.1292,0.7137,2.0119,0.6559,1.3709,1.4137,0.9633,3.9548,1.3868,2.3585,3.4842,3.9271,2.0616,4.2001,5.134,5.837,0.5502,0.2615,2.8087,5.4339,0.2188,4.4818,4.1583,5.5438,0.27,0.6271,1.783,3.8252,0.6109,0.9806,2.9167,0.9115,5.1991,0.1457,3.1015,0.0677,0.7053,0.3281,4.3633,1.138,0.8257,1.9323,2.1012,3.8104,4.0407,4.0829,1.4848,2.116,1.6925,1.6501,5.3573,1.2827,4.847,0.9812,6.1234,2.116,0.2899,0.3434,0.3292,4.0245,0.397,1.2568,3.3651,0.1656,0.03,1.7479,4.015,1.4145,0.6603,5.6471,0.9552,3.3074,6.1794,1.3495,5.0105,0.5475,2.1292,3.1565,3.6474,5.3699,3.0291,3.302,0.0574,0.0423,3.1866,5.3194,5.918,5.0735,5.4694,5.4779,1.169,5.8927,1.6343,0.0541,3.2925,4.3121,0.0289,5.3258,2.6998,3.9854,1.1459,4.3445,1.2986,0.576]}

{"id":255,"ended":true,"length":442,"gen_text":"The end of the war drastically reduced military investment in the island. Increasing enforcement of gambling laws and the growth of Las Vegas, Nevada as a competitive center of gambling and entertainment put more pressure on Puerto Rico in the way of economic development, especially the tourism industry, which provided a steady stream of revenue for the U.S.\n\nWhile the recovery in the late 1990s saw the island's economy grow from $17 billion in 2000 to more than $25 billion in 2016, the island still struggles to pay its bills.\n\nA 2011 IMF report notes that Puerto Rican fiscal policy is so dependent on oil revenue that debt payments are no longer feasible; further, the IMF states that if oil revenues drop because prices have risen, then the government will have to reduce spending further, which in turn may have long-term negative effects on the Puerto Rican economy.\n\nThe island is also in the middle of a deep fiscal crisis, which it began during the depths of the financial crisis. Under the previous administration, the island's government was forced to rely on oil revenues to make its deficit payments. Since 2009, however, the island has relied more on tourism revenues as well as other sources for income\u2014including taxes. These sources are expected to slow down in the near future.\n\nIn a report put out in 2015 by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), the Puerto Rican government revealed that the net interest burden on the government was the highest in the country; nearly 18 times the national average of 3.2 percent.\n\nWhen it comes to public pensions, the island's credit rating was lowered twice this year and will likely be downgraded more in 2017 due to its large unfunded liability and shrinking revenues.\n\nIn order to avoid losing access to the credit markets, the government plans to cut a quarter of all public sector positions, or 1,100 workers, by March 2018, in an effort to save some $75 million.\n\nPuerto Rico will also be forced to restructure about $9 billion in bonds and borrow even more money going forward.\n\nWith debt currently at an almost $70 billion, Puerto Rico currently has the highest public debt burden in the United States, surpassed only by California. In a worst-case scenario, Puerto Rico could enter bankruptcy, which is likely if its bonds are downgraded to junk.","token_len":479,"entropy":[6.176,0.9091,0.7197,3.9639,9.2231,1.2048,5.2714,7.355,1.1837,1.322,5.6553,1.2352,8.6098,9.9778,0.4369,7.2333,0.4245,1.716,1.7297,5.0167,0.0967,7.439,0.0365,3.0114,3.0811,2.4975,0.3291,9.679,4.9857,1.5427,1.0402,2.7073,2.6314,5.3615,2.9006,0.676,0.0286,2.7068,0.0727,4.9587,0.9959,5.9631,0.0673,2.912,0.4832,2.9308,3.0288,3.3402,2.5843,0.6401,2.7334,0.5439,4.1486,1.944,3.212,1.9871,0.0039,1.295,1.2965,0.2501,4.8505,0.0016,0.0031,0.0097,3.9683,0.0028,4.4866,1.0041,6.0319,3.764,0.8907,3.9972,0.7054,0.0622,4.2536,1.6958,2.3095,1.4515,0.8805,1.3649,2.5737,0.6903,4.0093,0.3465,0.6529,3.2312,0.0523,3.0332,0.0076,0.0113,4.6464,0.0237,0.1596,3.6348,0.105,1.172,1.9574,1.6414,2.5143,0.9854,3.6316,1.2045,1.0178,0.7177,1.6222,0.0002,4.0082,5.0173,3.7498,0.3987,5.0225,0.2641,1.4575,3.7564,4.0969,2.394,1.3245,4.3024,4.3372,0.06,2.7881,2.2337,0.2863,4.8339,2.1939,1.4004,3.6695,0.0479,4.4747,5.0437,5.7505,0.4179,0.9216,2.4011,3.4497,0.2774,4.3954,1.5097,2.3689,3.4529,5.543,5.149,1.4603,1.4632,0.4618,3.5394,1.2197,1.3829,0.9493,1.0596,0.3221,2.8845,0.9112,2.7568,1.7028,1.5428,2.9822,0.02,3.8387,3.3938,4.7123,0.1359,0.1269,1.0441,0.7076,0.1926,0.5356,3.9376,0.0471,0.0546,0.1691,0.1923,0.0002,1.9283,2.3424,2.1099,1.1445,2.8398,1.2614,2.1411,0.0018,0.3421,5.5282,3.7959,0.1384,1.4705,1.9324,4.1401,5.014,4.2713,0.1785,4.8303,0.0013,0.0419,2.2493,0.0202,1.4095,5.0948,0.8432,3.6149,0.5496,0.5513,0.9081,1.4507,1.5387,1.9224,2.287,1.6787,0.0484,4.3796,0.4335,2.7466,1.125,0.8047,2.3791,1.5777,3.7823,0.4417,0.7392,3.7018,3.0001,0.0889,1.4158,0.0025,0.9657,1.2904,0.4681,3.1607,1.5445,1.0011,2.2686,2.0136,3.5021,2.0291,0.0812,2.9951,1.3974,4.2947,2.475,4.636,1.4415,3.4753,2.7042,4.215,0.8312,2.2332,3.0783,0.005,4.9767,1.7253,1.5264,0.3326,1.7608,0.0805,1.1503,0.2788,0.0002,2.5693,3.0731,2.5159,6.6109,0.2392,1.0533,2.6636,1.4222,0.3241,1.5659,2.5465,0.6084,0.0269,0.0019,0.0002,0.0,1.7208,0.0013,0.0001,0.106,0.8082,1.9472,0.3506,0.3474,5.4119,0.1847,1.445,6.1717,4.5083,2.3235,1.0119,0.3196,2.2577,1.9811,3.6407,0.5272,0.5838,0.0827,1.5674,3.6424,5.706,5.404,6.2698,0.9644,1.5758,0.0361,3.3098,1.5654,0.1656,2.4021,0.3646,0.4652,1.2895,0.0002,5.5474,2.3477,0.0946,0.0083,4.082,2.9165,0.1606,0.6965,2.0035,1.415,6.1688,0.1767,1.6477,2.6467,3.6644,4.3244,0.2281,3.2084,3.2726,0.9263,0.693,0.9128,0.0108,3.2327,1.9088,2.9505,3.013,0.0229,1.6751,3.7891,2.1258,0.0001,0.0005,2.3219,2.694,5.3036,2.4012,0.1959,0.6758,0.0002,2.7325,3.7768,0.094,3.6836,4.6075,2.5874,0.0047,1.0161,3.2711,0.0817,0.3262,0.5118,0.8096,3.8548,0.1048,2.7011,4.7948,5.4209,0.1607,3.453,1.4683,1.8742,3.3185,1.7002,3.3988,3.1139,0.1943,3.1995,2.5627,0.591,1.1977,3.5584,2.2052,1.6654,3.6894,1.6102,0.3161,0.0127,2.5636,3.6662,0.3256,5.6549,0.0397,0.9914,0.836,0.0002,2.7345,0.0297,0.0003,0.1108,4.2739,1.019,1.769,1.2725,0.0188,3.6425,0.0038,3.7117,0.0944,2.5749,0.2502,0.576,2.6156,2.9932,4.3902,4.9136,0.0298,1.0359,6.9092,0.0378,0.7292,0.8669,0.0002,4.1849,4.5918,4.3367,1.471,2.8449,5.8446,1.5235,0.8034,0.0135,1.3159,1.1355,0.0527,4.7034,0.9231,0.6729,0.7038,1.9048,0.0662,1.4487,0.3023,0.0543,1.3078,0.0021,1.5667,4.1391,0.019,0.0087,1.3169,0.9387,3.5918,3.2338,5.4552,0.3616,0.0018,0.0245,0.1271,1.8068,0.0385,0.9021,5.4991,1.3245,1.9011,1.1827,2.9169,2.8144,3.6763,2.3358,4.4733,1.718,1.3946,0.0004,1.8542,0.0819,2.2035]}
{"id":962,"ended":true,"length":432,"gen_text":"The 2011 season, although great by most players'standards, was a lean year for Federer. He was defeated in straight sets in the semifinals of the 2011 Australian Open by eventual finalist Andy Roddick, and in the third round of the French Open by Rafael Nadal. In all other tournaments Federer defeated Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals, the semifinals, the third round, and the finals.\nWith this season being his age 34 season and Novak Djokovic not yet having played a second Grand Slam tournament where he has not been defeated, Federer is the consensus pick to win the year. The question with Federer is how much he has left in the tank? He came incredibly close at the 2010 Australian Open, with a 4-5 6-0 6-3 victory against Andy Murray, but the result was waved off by the umpire due to weather conditions. The next year, after a 4-6 6-3 6-1 run, Federer won his second consecutive French Open Grand Slam and the third Australian Open, but he got his revenge at Roland Garros in a rematch of the 2010 final. His loss to Rafa was devastating for Federer and set the tone for what would become his undoing: Federer was beaten by a player who dominated him throughout his whole career in the final 5 sets. The rest is sad history. Federer will be 37 years old this summer, which means the next 3 and a half years will be the last where the same man will be in the semifinals, finals, and championship. As long as Nadal can stay healthy, this will be a great year for him.\u00a0 It has been said that Roger Federer has \"a year left in the tank\", but if so, he needs this year to be even more dominant than 2011, which was a very solid year in his career. If he can get his game in tact, Federer may be able to make one last run at the Grand Slam titles, winning two of them in a row for the first time in his career.\nIt's still early, but we could be seeing the greatest year of Roger Federer not just in his career, but in the history of tennis.\nLet's have a look at how I see Roger Federer as you vote, and share if you like this article.","token_len":479,"entropy":[9.1056,4.8392,2.8482,6.625,5.7706,3.403,2.4327,7.246,6.0487,16.224,3.803,0.9949,0.2083,0.7128,1.7244,9.1768,1.2556,0.2881,8.6212,0.0995,0.7388,1.2429,2.2711,5.3837,0.8156,4.8956,0.0051,1.5926,0.6364,2.5389,0.6673,0.5919,5.0597,1.5601,0.0155,1.8698,4.028,4.1148,0.0087,2.0793,1.0463,0.0,0.0,0.9013,1.0911,2.4327,0.2798,2.2169,0.0631,0.2475,0.4993,1.0385,0.0112,0.9326,3.6681,0.0001,0.0002,0.3262,2.4176,4.0074,4.6122,2.5877,2.2149,0.003,5.3263,4.5373,0.0006,0.0006,0.0001,0.001,1.3607,0.8828,1.5686,0.0739,0.9131,2.7616,0.9933,0.4546,1.1151,1.0838,0.0686,0.4472,0.3407,0.2608,2.0262,0.5058,1.2795,10.8936,3.6133,3.3252,3.4303,1.3278,4.539,2.8569,0.5394,2.4017,5.3576,0.0009,0.2675,0.0003,0.0013,4.1723,2.8783,2.3833,2.8756,0.7756,6.4499,2.1563,0.0008,1.7107,7.0924,0.4586,1.6797,1.329,1.4618,1.213,0.5791,1.0612,0.0034,1.6137,2.0511,5.4234,3.0701,0.4132,0.2795,0.7455,4.1522,1.8135,2.9057,2.2317,5.0671,0.2751,0.0079,0.613,1.911,1.6714,2.0478,1.5782,0.1382,0.4414,0.2048,0.0022,2.5314,2.4012,5.232,6.8575,0.0076,3.1385,0.7038,3.509,1.0762,0.0113,1.1171,5.3955,0.7265,3.4332,0.3699,2.1161,2.6212,0.0336,4.5935,0.5274,0.005,1.1924,1.9895,2.6559,2.506,1.8124,1.3579,0.7945,2.8887,4.1969,0.4967,5.8161,0.0878,1.6736,0.4322,2.4639,0.3717,3.1686,0.0064,5.8801,1.8152,0.2872,2.7684,2.6651,0.9302,1.1873,4.5334,1.8226,5.1727,0.0572,1.4203,0.2446,0.0024,1.1607,0.6699,0.001,1.8471,5.8623,1.8622,0.6253,0.0021,4.0001,1.7052,2.0749,3.2104,2.9761,0.0478,6.4736,0.0097,2.699,2.7202,3.6933,6.5028,0.0806,2.5384,1.3954,2.2444,5.6005,3.7693,0.8601,1.6178,2.5729,0.0001,0.0,2.2676,2.0745,4.3775,1.2503,0.6136,0.3712,0.4316,0.7763,3.823,3.5715,0.6768,3.695,0.0082,2.3593,5.5335,1.8122,0.8983,0.003,2.5024,5.7123,0.7633,0.5365,0.0693,2.6542,1.0076,1.7011,1.8034,4.7978,0.0004,4.0346,3.2089,0.0023,2.1669,2.1701,1.7315,2.8918,3.1467,0.9179,6.3422,1.7105,2.9959,1.4281,4.5262,0.0604,3.2121,1.2329,1.9358,6.8577,0.9335,0.9031,2.7474,5.2334,1.7846,6.9989,0.4386,0.4618,2.8149,0.0061,3.4566,1.5087,2.7278,1.1651,0.09,1.9541,2.9018,1.1185,3.1739,1.5737,3.4319,2.1515,4.1155,4.6535,0.2143,0.0072,0.2184,0.7913,0.1804,2.2573,2.5816,4.0879,3.6271,4.907,2.8286,0.947,0.9025,3.2862,0.5304,5.2469,3.0036,1.7088,0.1548,0.2968,4.6308,1.4604,4.636,3.5198,0.0075,3.7552,0.0005,3.0668,1.735,0.1406,0.6599,4.7479,1.4281,0.5275,0.8712,2.0376,1.2604,0.1067,0.9893,0.6558,5.8818,5.4203,3.6238,0.3504,1.6472,0.5986,3.6326,0.1801,0.0002,2.1458,4.3131,3.2862,4.6718,1.9188,0.2352,0.7087,0.005,1.744,1.2768,3.4785,4.3935,0.39,1.4549,3.6039,5.0968,0.8553,0.2253,1.4234,4.0918,2.0296,2.7318,0.2666,2.606,2.4982,2.8412,1.0439,1.897,2.9493,3.8586,0.2389,3.4622,1.0386,0.6287,0.3312,3.14,1.3295,0.9374,2.8538,2.5161,2.4887,2.276,5.3828,0.9139,2.1763,0.0047,3.5023,1.2398,0.6243,0.0067,3.3736,4.8604,0.824,0.2769,0.4006,0.8098,2.9478,0.0023,3.6585,1.5059,4.615,3.9119,2.007,0.401,2.3908,1.5828,0.1361,2.9836,0.0825,0.1712,0.0136,0.9008,0.3107,0.0662,0.1819,2.1358,4.7443,1.8567,4.678,2.41,1.417,0.287,3.7364,4.1094,0.8508,1.4759,1.1682,2.7712,2.8162,1.1705,0.4649,0.0115,0.0009,6.9636,1.361,0.4164,0.4662,0.1934,0.2148,0.0078,0.4062,1.6808,0.3795,0.002,0.2875,0.2393,2.0269,5.3883,0.7644,4.3801,0.1959,0.1989,0.1475,2.4989,4.0929,0.7661,3.2099,0.2143,0.0003,4.4332,6.73,3.4622,3.4909,1.224,3.8535,5.413,0.0656,2.129,2.5965,1.6749,0.7854]}
{"id":4822,"ended":true,"length":455,"gen_text":"In 2002, the Royal Navy destroyer HMS Nottingham struck Wolf Rock, a reef at Lord Howe Island, and almost sank. In recent times tourism has increased and the government of New Zealand has invested in the reefs for future use as marine reserves. The Royal New Zealand Navy's 7th Fleet is currently involved in the Pacific campaign and has provided security for the ROV's.\n\nThis research into the life of Wolf Rock is interesting and important for many researchers. Our research shows that the ocean floor is an important habitat and that Wolf Rock has many special characteristics. Wolf Rock seems to exist in the deep recesses of the oceans, it has no light, no heat, and most of its gases are stored in minerals on top of the hardening crust, with a thin protective crust of volcanic carbonate or sand deposited by the volcanic eruptions, making it one of the coolest places in the world. It has little oxygen and relatively little nitrogen but oxygen is found in many places and is generally plentiful. In addition, Wolf Rock is unique as it is the only area where a large percentage of the rocks are found to contain copper. It is the only place in the world which is known to contain so many rare minerals. Wolf Rock has produced two type of crust from its formation. The crust is soft, being mostly rock, whilst the crust above it is solid which is mostly gravel. These two types may be different in the rock layers where they originate.\n\nThere are no human associated threats to Wolf Rock due to the lack of life in this region. It is an isolated ecosystem that is unique in the world and will help researchers better understand many different aspects of the ocean floor. It has very high resistance to ocean acidification and as a result would be invaluable in modelling our oceans in the future. I hope that I have illustrated the importance of such large areas of sea floor in our Ocean as a reservoir of precious resources, where we find clues to how Earth functioned billions of years ago, and could ever function again.\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\n\nDr James Mollers is a marine geologist, an investigator for the Science and Technology Facilities Council, a member of the Ocean Acidification Research Consortium and a researcher for the Universities of Exeter and Plymouth.

{"id":4180,"ended":true,"length":453,"gen_text":"On June 29, 1909, the Pittsburgh Pirates defeated the Chicago Cubs, 8 \u2013 1 at Exposition Park. The two teams opened Forbes Field the following day. Fans began to arrive in droves for the ballpark's inaugural game.\nIt was the first professional baseball game in Pittsburgh. Pirates second baseman Johnny Mize, Pittsburgh's leading player, was the first major league slugger played at the ballpark. In the opening years after the ballpark was opened, the Pirates played at Forbes Field until 1917.\nIn September, 1910, Forbes Field hosted the National League World Series. The Pittsburgh Pirates won the four games to claim the pennant. This paved the way for the Pirates to move to their new home on North Carson Street for the 1912 season.\nIn 1914, Forbes Field hosted what was to become one of the most famous games in baseball history: the Battle of the Batters. Two teams from the rival National League competed in a single day, with the winner taking home the World Series.\nIn 1919, Forbes Field hosted the last World Series contest between the Detroit Tigers and Montreal Royals during the second world war.\nIn April of 1940, Forbes Field hosted another World Series between the Yankees and the Brooklyn Dodgers. After losing the first two games, the Yankees came back to beat the Dodgers in the next three games to claim the first ever championship of the American League (the Yankees still only earned the pennant by one game). At the conclusion of the World Series, the stadium had a seating capacity of more than 40,000.\nIn 1948, Forbes Field hosted the game that launched the New York Yankees. The Yankee Stadium would soon come to be known as The Polo Grounds when the franchise moved from New York to Manhattan. The ballpark would play host to 14 World Series and 28 American League championship games.\nToday, the property is home to the PNC Arts Center.

{"id":4656,"ended":true,"length":379,"gen_text":"Kapoor returned to film as the female protagonist Geet Dhillon, a vivacious Sikh girl with a zest for life, in the romantic comedy Jab We Met ( 2007 ). Director Imtiaz Ali, played by Shabana Azmi, plays the hapless Bollywood B-team-cum-director Roshan Khaat and gets to enjoy a delightful cameo in the film.\n\nThis wasn't the first Hindi-language film that Kaur Kapoor appeared in after her success with The Devil In Miss Asia (1990). She had also appeared in Rang De Basanti (1996), starring Lata Mangeshkar and Naseeruddin Shah. Though she was more than fine in this film, Kaur Kapoor had turned down a role in Raj Kapoor's Aapki Bhaiyaan(1995), which was a spinoff from Raj Kapoor Productions (RJP).\n\nKaur Kapoor wasn't a member of any'super group' and never appeared in Bollywood films, apart from being in a couple of TV serials such as Pannu Bishan Mein, Kamasen, Aap Ki Ajay, and Kamaswani. Her performance in Jab We Met was based on the real life life of Kripal Singh, a Delhi based singer-songwriter who became the star of The Devil In Miss Asia.\n\nShe had acted in five movies, including 'Nakhand' in 1996, and appeared in films such as 'Dhool Hain Mirch' in 1998, and 'Dhoom darshan hai' in 1999, both directed by R-Padmaja. And when the time came, she was ready, and appeared in the film The White Queen (2002), in which she played the role of an older and wiser girl, a 'bollywood princess'.\n\nKapoor's performance is very underrated in her career, as well as in terms of her overall acting quality. Even after over 35 years she hasn't lost that edge and keeps it fresh with every film she turns out.\n\nWith many more films to come, her schedule looks daunting, yet she continues to look at new challenges and create the sort of roles that will leave a lasting impression with audiences.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Crave.com.","token_len":480,"entropy":[6.5715,1.6856,9.0544,0.3727,6.3534,5.2297,1.9562,6.2417,2.9821,8.96,1.3249,7.2534,4.6544,0.0007,1.2295,2.0043,7.7696,0.4699,0.0012,8.4273,2.0092,3.2047,0.6569,6.7932,0.1608,0.0285,0.3064,2.163,2.8165,1.1427,4.9862,0.6933,6.064,2.2949,0.0044,5.603,10.2047,0.584,7.1233,8.1179,0.064,0.0223,0.0512,2.735,5.9059,0.4392,4.3522,1.3428,0.0154,0.0049,0.0014,0.208,3.9893,0.9078,6.1309,0.0307,4.7189,1.5382,6.1345,2.1326,2.7319,5.2951,3.2792,0.0363,4.9589,4.4875,3.3336,0.028,3.7861,5.5627,4.3701,3.5874,5.9578,1.8667,5.2656,1.5006,5.6742,2.634,1.5694,0.4911,0.3755,0.636,1.6117,0.0975,5.0107,5.6766,0.0006,0.4495,0.4958,5.6786,2.6153,0.6475,0.5268,2.03,4.3861,1.7586,2.6628,0.0022,2.8873,0.0355,1.9667,1.5952,4.0537,1.0326,3.8768,4.7342,2.8669,0.6888,3.6526,0.7279,4.9237,0.5699,1.2546,1.3154,1.5617,1.6502,0.1064,5.3189,1.9629,0.1517,0.0027,0.0002,0.2645,2.9959,0.7512,4.7085,5.5342,0.09,0.0052,0.0002,0.0,1.3108,4.25,0.4503,0.001,0.0012,0.0006,0.8795,5.0327,1.7992,1.9636,4.852,2.5713,5.5127,0.9599,2.287,0.3294,0.1752,3.722,0.022,0.2816,0.0003,2.8055,5.7917,0.4494,1.995,1.23,0.1523,4.2837,1.3758,0.0011,0.5279,3.9515,1.8283,5.4217,4.9178,0.3162,1.7595,0.9946,6.6013,2.6968,1.3009,1.4011,1.2261,3.1741,5.6057,1.6944,1.789,3.316,0.0534,0.0001,4.923,3.0659,0.7436,2.5433,0.4899,1.1643,0.0002,1.8007,0.4558,0.0648,0.0005,5.8642,0.0003,2.628,4.8652,0.0076,3.5034,10.6738,11.5867,2.3792,9.5463,2.7416,3.7785,2.4956,0.3221,4.044,0.0657,0.87,3.6475,3.3599,0.0051,3.8756,1.5823,1.8009,2.0682,0.0366,2.5034,0.6133,0.0009,3.3326,0.0159,4.4797,5.2893,0.1854,4.1201,4.8608,1.9295,4.5105,0.1167,2.0164,5.5285,2.2173,6.8158,2.9155,3.9335,1.7452,0.832,6.0925,2.8243,0.8755,2.446,4.5046,0.1214,4.9426,4.2562,0.6156,2.9009,5.1161,0.2501,3.3331,0.0087,0.001,1.0666,5.4633,0.079,1.6695,2.0582,0.7227,3.6933,0.6734,4.2455,6.3772,0.9591,0.6791,0.7136,0.7703,4.0966,3.1604,4.1166,1.9039,0.6568,0.0935,0.9927,3.8776,1.9982,4.2749,0.1333,3.3018,0.7692,0.125,0.024,0.0068,0.6378,0.8448,0.0002,3.2085,2.0864,4.9514,0.1853,5.6766,2.7748,2.3476,1.3786,6.2358,4.1554,4.2365,5.0979,2.2674,2.3744,3.1612,0.6631,1.9885,4.3597,0.1238,4.1511,0.7829,0.0152,1.8055,3.368,2.5791,3.6236,3.6375,0.0798,5.6185,1.6329,0.7421,1.1511,1.3199,0.3747,2.1453,0.3102,3.1893,1.6168,1.1575,6.6443,5.2075,0.0725,3.5879,0.2459,0.4272,0.1434,1.3364,2.3383,2.3531,1.2605,0.0043,2.9283,6.6464,4.7795,0.358,2.6165,1.0876,5.9856,4.9816,2.5209,2.9845,0.3707,1.9611,0.7247,2.196,1.7887,4.7772,1.6305,3.9604,0.1096,1.9545,2.6961,3.651,5.1253,4.697,0.9089,2.2458,0.9686,3.3171,0.1362,0.1884,0.6031,0.8628,1.1072,0.0096,3.5965,4.3757,3.5427,0.728,5.1032,1.9165,3.9446,5.501,4.6103,3.5583,2.7029,0.9546,0.5751,0.0002,1.9163,0.8332,0.006,1.6414,4.0039,4.4233,3.9038,4.5404,1.7803,2.959,2.5024,1.2148,2.3478,4.5133,0.2162,0.9293,4.3632,0.0021,1.149,3.8966,2.0033,3.6444,0.2373,4.695,3.4325,4.4475,5.4365,0.182,5.5541,2.8823,0.0008,2.3772,3.0975,2.3083,1.9502,5.5383,3.4462,2.6835,2.7275,0.9185,1.5143,1.0046,5.6321,0.8162,0.2856,1.209,0.0002,5.157,4.746,1.8817,0.8349,1.0011,0.229,0.3051,3.7508,5.9141,3.2346,4.4637,0.8642,3.7778,0.8897,2.8078,0.0837,4.0066,2.831,4.1315,1.2979,1.1381,4.9811,3.8927,5.2699,0.0036,2.7049,0.3802,1.7892,3.9075,1.9303,0.649,0.3394,4.4563,0.993,0.2225,0.8892,0.0002,4.6374,1.1003,2.5195,0.0182,0.3674,4.4955,4.0819,1.903,0.9577,0.7838]}

As the songs \"Borrowed Time,\" \"Get Away\" and \"Umbrella\" play, Levine is seen with half-smiles appearing on his face.\n\nLevine's publicist, a woman named Laura Schmeling, has been answering phone calls from media outlets and celebrities after speaking with The Huffington Post.\n\nIt is a far cry from four years ago when Levine appeared on Celebrity Apprentice, a TV show that aired on NBC. The show debuted with two contestants vying for the throne of the US Apprentice; one would be made president and the other would be fired with Levine playing the role of Trump's aide Gary Busey.\n\n\"Donald Trump is a friend of mine, and he loves me,\" Levine said at the time, explaining his decision to take part in the show. \"And we're both very, very rich. I want to help him win.\"\n\nAt some point during the interview, Levine's face turns towards Rihanna and he appears to be on the verge of tears as he begins to speak about the relationship between the American and Canadian pop star.\n\nLevine starts by asking Rihanna what her relationship with her father, who is currently in prison, has been like over the years.\n\n\"Honestly, there are a lot of hard things he is going through,\" she answers.\n\n\"And we talk about it. We talk as a mom and dad -- that's just the way it is for me.\"\n\nLater on in the interview, he also mentions his mother, who passed away in February, and his girlfriend, and their relationship in the US versus his time at UBC.\n\nLevine goes on to note that he isn't upset with her because, in fact, he's a fan of her.\n\n\"I am a big fan of her. And I love that she wrote one of my songs when I was going through tough times,\" Levine explains. \"So I think it's a great, great thing that she did.\"\n\nLevine continues on about how they first met and what he's hoping for with Rihanna in the future.\n\n\"I hope she writes songs for me again.\"","token_len":480,"entropy":[6.5795,4.3967,0.2803,1.8419,4.1493,0.0463,1.2432,6.6229,0.7555,1.8353,11.6664,3.4699,10.3508,0.049,4.8001,5.6001,0.2122,0.0079,2.3997,0.3791,0.9877,2.1676,8.4484,2.0021,3.4057,2.6842,3.7189,0.8872,3.4636,10.3824,2.5245,0.7931,3.9455,1.5212,7.2211,3.8867,3.8086,5.9421,0.276,0.0018,2.2101,0.053,5.0575,4.2512,0.573,0.0084,0.0345,4.1502,0.0798,0.0024,0.054,1.3433,0.473,1.0768,2.8688,2.2021,4.0008,6.5708,1.4401,3.2578,0.4881,6.12,0.4578,0.5982,0.0539,0.8141,1.0968,0.0004,2.7248,0.0003,2.2616,5.113,0.0575,1.3087,5.2551,1.1931,1.405,5.1716,5.6381,5.3474,2.8933,0.0626,4.6576,1.7133,3.8217,4.058,0.0845,1.1422,2.1094,0.6571,2.2943,4.3137,4.5557,5.9799,0.8868,2.9825,2.3044,0.0018,1.1929,1.2862,0.0002,5.0122,1.9978,3.9108,3.6331,0.0462,0.0197,6.9254,0.1372,0.017,1.2285,0.8388,4.143,1.045,5.9284,1.5821,1.6384,2.0081,4.5477,0.4697,1.1676,3.445,0.5906,0.1105,0.6998,2.4738,1.4008,5.784,3.721,4.9783,1.7179,3.2631,0.3714,0.4769,5.9109,0.497,1.4041,5.6132,5.198,4.9043,1.9616,4.5057,0.8214,5.6514,2.4232,1.1247,0.2272,0.0183,0.4561,0.4286,2.9534,6.2366,2.2206,3.8496,0.6698,0.6486,0.0352,4.4913,1.8202,5.4728,5.3646,0.011,0.0001,0.0001,0.1057,0.4538,0.0002,2.3433,3.9314,0.3795,1.4959,1.2532,4.0423,0.2215,0.0472,1.5021,0.9704,1.7142,4.6697,1.194,0.9528,0.0967,0.7062,1.3784,0.0371,0.0251,2.3884,3.3677,1.337,1.3898,0.1004,2.1516,0.9659,0.5724,0.0627,0.4399,0.1112,0.483,2.9168,3.8272,1.4958,2.3404,2.2589,2.6656,0.0089,1.9445,1.332,1.8615,4.0583,0.2038,2.2428,1.3148,2.1073,1.0128,0.0737,0.0002,4.0613,5.6582,0.0482,0.5524,0.2838,4.4014,0.1701,1.0792,3.1945,2.9338,2.5206,5.291,0.7616,0.0012,1.1018,1.4889,3.1571,0.0895,1.9281,5.0857,0.053,0.1639,0.0022,0.1619,3.0351,0.3633,3.4941,0.3095,1.9023,1.2317,1.3759,3.5084,0.9564,1.4861,6.7729,1.5411,1.3855,1.4294,1.3015,0.1359,0.2005,0.0002,2.3757,0.0001,5.8739,1.8586,3.338,0.3219,0.001,2.4437,1.8272,2.7995,0.4308,2.1223,1.4534,1.6335,3.0756,1.6153,2.7531,1.1974,1.3168,0.6863,1.6686,0.0219,0.0243,2.5403,0.013,0.4995,0.1024,0.6702,0.0002,0.3346,5.321,0.1515,4.4072,2.3561,1.7896,0.2204,0.02,4.5571,1.657,4.0248,5.6243,0.8765,0.044,0.9578,1.3923,4.0514,0.4271,1.4915,0.0002,0.9862,2.8632,4.1796,2.934,1.0622,0.535,1.9234,1.3432,1.1971,6.2768,0.8364,5.3619,0.4227,1.4852,5.3231,3.4111,0.6097,4.0212,1.2084,0.4465,0.6236,0.1143,4.9424,1.2498,1.8012,0.0335,0.0002,4.017,1.6039,0.7722,0.0076,0.6899,0.046,3.7967,3.6879,2.9003,1.9399,2.8197,1.083,0.9552,1.9248,0.008,0.9229,4.2779,2.0739,0.9528,1.5387,4.4609,0.5802,4.726,3.4997,1.1511,4.5089,1.7631,4.1083,5.3111,2.3536,5.8351,4.6926,8.5686,0.9498,0.1753,0.1032,0.0002,2.336,0.0002,3.7703,0.0533,0.0272,5.4666,0.4329,1.0667,5.5129,0.0002,5.2505,1.3088,3.6061,2.2595,4.3293,2.5879,2.8914,0.0042,0.7302,2.2827,3.9808,1.5182,0.228,0.7977,1.7349,0.2341,0.0002,0.1987,0.7451,3.4609,0.8771,2.0017,0.2369,0.2814,1.1054,1.6152,2.615,0.7061,2.2069,3.2027,0.2491,5.1407,4.7101,0.0308,0.2334,0.2728,5.1865,0.6497,0.1235,4.624,0.1573,3.7311,0.0499,1.1631,1.6474,2.8611,0.1501,0.7352,2.6213,0.9648,3.0512,1.8237,0.284,1.9259,2.5023,4.3209,0.5808,0.8901,0.9383,0.2353,2.105,0.9722,0.0253,0.0002,2.1932,0.0003,3.3057,2.8371,2.9677,1.2407,3.8027,3.4047,0.1387,1.3612,2.879,1.7109,2.3196,4.2528,0.9253,2.4954,1.2321,0.0006,2.1505,0.3022,0.0643,0.1546,0.1032,0.0002,0.117,0.6327,2.4252,1.31,4.6249,3.1616,0.7925,0.1807,2.8545,4.2475]}

A shipboard inspection during this time found her hull was rotten with shipworm and she would have to be rebuilt for sea service. Her first voyage was completed in January 1940 and in June 1940 she was commissioned into the Australian Navy.\n\nWhile in the Australian Navy, she served as a target ship during training exercises and was used as a training ship for her sisters after her refit. During World War II, she spent most of her time at RAAF Base Sydney and was used for training aircraft for new operations. She was torpedoed off Perth on 4 January 1942, but most of her damage was repaired and on 9th January 1942 she returned to RAAF Base Sydney. She was scrapped there on 14th February 1942.\n\nPossibly more than any other ship the Queen Elizabeth has enjoyed fame for many different reasons and in its recent history, it has been a proud and important part of the Australian and New Zealand navies. She has also had many interesting and entertaining visitors ; some of the most famous of whom have included the Prince of Wales in 1943, Winston Churchill on a visit in 1955 and in 2008 David Beckham spent one of his tour days in Sydney when he visited RAAF Base New South Wales where the ship is stationed. When the ship was commissioned back in 1938, she was so poorly crewed that the ship had been nicknamed'The White Elephant '. During her visit to Australia, she was visited by the crew of the famous submarine HMS Terror, a visit which caused great excitement and became an annual event. The ship has been visited by sailors from the US, Britain, the Soviet Union, France and Japan, and has also been a visit point for US President George H.W. Bush.\n\nNow the Queen Elizabeth is a museum in the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, and a popular tourist attraction around the country. And for a considerable amount of time she will also continue to be the focal point of the history of the fleet where she will carry on with its legacy of inspiring, inspiring, inspiring, for a hundred years or more. She's had some remarkable visitors over the years and one visitor has been the crew of the HMS Terror. Her crew will now be remembered with a special plaque on the memorial, and some of them can be seen in this image.","token_len":481,"entropy":[1.701,2.4133,9.2975,9.7379,1.1905,5.1835,4.6872,2.5137,3.9962,2.4151,2.3892,3.3991,4.2996,1.7772,3.6519,2.1031,8.1969,0.7118,1.8255,1.8252,4.1087,3.8646,4.5793,5.6603,5.7047,1.4433,0.5749,1.7916,2.8815,2.8247,3.1639,6.5377,3.7347,6.0806,2.0274,1.5378,3.4692,3.4771,1.092,0.1849,0.0862,3.7206,4.8308,2.756,2.1694,0.2709,3.6389,3.7165,1.7846,1.2439,3.1691,0.7519,3.145,5.8176,1.7554,3.4828,2.0411,1.7867,0.5858,1.0361,2.1855,1.5846,0.0827,1.5716,0.4301,0.683,1.1842,0.0129,4.8893,1.8617,1.409,2.2071,0.1834,0.6066,1.9945,2.2141,1.6497,1.2122,4.3616,0.5073,2.2202,4.0033,0.2807,1.812,2.5721,1.8563,1.2259,0.1988,1.3711,0.5436,1.2654,3.8954,3.399,6.1701,1.7459,2.8273,0.1554,0.3427,3.0655,2.0058,0.002,0.2859,0.5726,0.5386,4.9614,1.7701,0.0067,0.169,0.1605,1.8033,4.7445,0.9044,0.924,3.8761,1.6858,1.7327,1.375,1.7377,1.4238,2.5432,3.4387,5.9679,4.1501,0.794,1.5343,0.5789,5.5998,0.0026,2.4691,5.4952,1.2297,3.882,3.0929,1.7703,1.6618,1.6497,5.5581,0.0624,0.233,4.2001,0.1142,0.6781,1.1081,5.0716,3.4778,5.2896,1.0992,1.1327,0.3799,2.6701,0.0709,0.9445,0.0039,0.1723,0.4406,0.724,1.8246,0.8197,4.5484,2.2233,1.0676,3.3432,0.4585,1.5152,0.5971,0.2227,0.2277,0.0002,5.5273,3.5889,5.3072,1.8398,1.2135,0.1362,0.5455,4.1592,2.4846,0.2452,2.6662,5.1319,4.3432,2.8883,3.9982,2.349,0.3531,3.1849,3.2817,5.5666,6.148,1.4468,1.9501,1.5684,0.5389,1.1468,2.41,4.5972,2.0779,4.0987,0.8623,0.0128,1.4874,1.3114,3.0549,0.5313,0.0078,1.3044,0.0016,0.3246,2.307,0.9554,3.3394,2.3437,2.233,3.7913,1.7115,3.431,3.2044,11.1475,3.3418,0.5852,2.3883,1.215,0.8559,1.9996,1.3018,1.9555,1.0761,2.0337,2.8747,0.0768,0.0127,4.8858,3.9934,0.7363,3.4112,0.0005,3.4719,2.4064,0.6102,0.5668,4.1547,1.0144,3.9192,4.9574,6.0556,0.3338,5.94,4.738,1.4983,0.1288,5.087,4.8299,1.8664,1.6201,6.0676,0.6245,0.9632,4.2282,0.0346,0.0991,4.9633,0.4746,0.0004,4.4669,1.3135,1.1393,1.4556,3.5164,0.2577,6.5129,1.4109,1.5147,0.9636,2.3706,5.0714,0.1199,3.0779,0.449,1.3326,0.4214,5.5457,5.3012,5.3667,0.001,0.4508,1.9207,2.3308,2.5184,3.5298,2.654,9.1491,2.0958,4.7665,1.9679,8.5518,4.3451,1.0416,4.9644,0.2748,1.093,2.4513,1.2711,0.9825,1.5896,0.0931,1.421,5.183,0.1612,0.5152,4.3569,3.1916,0.7909,2.4837,1.956,3.506,1.524,0.7645,3.537,2.8111,1.5869,1.8304,5.3869,2.4894,2.7399,1.1425,0.712,2.4269,1.1661,1.378,1.8536,1.0653,0.2487,6.1373,0.6365,1.7165,1.8739,1.4476,2.5864,0.2549,3.1692,1.8154,0.0078,0.4254,1.8698,1.2886,2.6925,1.8691,1.6639,2.2018,1.7849,0.7082,3.4596,4.2279,0.758,0.1938,4.3195,1.605,2.2168,1.8506,0.3357,0.4588,0.1957,0.0076,1.3193,0.9844,0.0002,5.5343,2.7542,1.131,0.0051,0.8471,2.606,1.4132,3.4226,2.1854,2.9987,2.2869,0.0282,1.8259,0.1839,0.9071,1.9437,3.1185,3.7356,0.6664,0.192,4.9361,0.6527,1.0309,0.2689,6.36,3.4953,3.0337,6.0188,1.6843,0.0096,0.6358,2.1677,2.0284,2.5244,2.2833,0.0596,0.8473,2.5371,4.191,0.0172,0.2276,1.1612,5.5823,0.2232,0.8605,5.1192,6.4616,0.7987,1.1584,5.7621,0.3261,4.2383,3.3932,2.5728,1.3388,5.4385,3.3672,1.1574,1.5753,0.0381,2.2581,5.5944,3.137,5.2978,0.1451,2.8267,0.1941,0.8441,4.1144,3.5107,4.9156,3.1089,4.5139,1.954,1.582,0.2719,0.1623,1.2337,3.7883,4.6118,3.4283,1.3715,2.3126,4.7668,0.07,1.0745,1.1653,0.1979,1.3034,4.7045,1.722,3.689,2.6416,1.2117,2.7529,2.8646,0.6072,2.6619,1.4617,1.7159,0.6966,4.9939,2.737,1.4688,4.7161,0.7246,1.0863,4.9389,0.9572,0.1987,1.4641,1.7145,4.0025,1.2049]}

{"id":445,"ended":true,"length":424,"gen_text":"Having previously worked on D.R. & < unk > for 2000 AD, a title made popular by John Constantine's creator Alan Moore, Delano was selected to start the character's first new ongoing title in over a decade. The story will be put together by DC Comics' own inhouse writer Tony Bedard and Delano and will follow the new-came-back status quo of the character following the recent New 52.\n\nDelano said of his work on Constantine, \"He is a man of contradictions, a very troubled, complex man who is at times completely lost. He is also a tortured soul, who has suffered so much with so much hate and anger towards every person and situation he's encountered on his path that he's lost the ability to be anything but angry at everything, which is pretty horrible. His humanity is a very important part of who Constantine is, and he'll live with this for the rest of his life.\" Read more on Delano and Constantine here.\n\nIn addition, Dark Horse announced that it will also publish five new single issue graphic novels titled Constantine: The Hellblazer, written by Frank Miller and illustrated by Paul Neary. Written with comic book artists in mind, the first one, Constantine: The Hellblazer (in stores January 12th, 2018) will be one of the first issues of The Hellblazer reboot, with the title taking on the legacy of Frank Miller's seminal series. Miller will also provide an original introduction to the character and serve as a guest artist on two subsequent issues.\n\nComics are also getting more diverse with the introduction of the Black Cat\/Black Bolt team book featuring Carol Danvers and Nakia, written by Kelly Sue DeConnick and illustrated by Adrian Alphona, and in June, the debut of The New 52: Wonder Woman\/Wonder Girl in the form of written by Greg Rucka with art by Cliff Chiang, another project from Kelly Sue DeConnick.\n\nThe latest addition to the lineup of The New 52, Aquaman #1 by Dan Abnett, Andy Kubert, Paul Pelletier, Howard Porter, and Jorge Jimenez, was solicited for release on October 2, the day of the new issue's release. This is the first original graphic novel about the Green Arrow\/Aquaman hybrid, written by Abnett.","token_len":482,"entropy":[5.9223,2.577,2.0476,6.9703,4.0964,4.3571,0.0143,6.5841,10.9683,11.1492,1.809,1.0437,4.2219,9.7966,3.7928,0.5566,5.9774,5.3857,6.5801,3.7917,0.2025,4.4733,5.4774,2.9083,5.4979,1.8366,0.0011,0.3868,6.6861,2.8282,2.968,6.3454,1.036,6.6175,2.3493,5.845,1.6956,3.5275,3.4268,1.4629,2.0217,1.0603,2.1951,1.0489,0.0706,0.5106,2.5177,3.4679,1.8665,1.4273,6.3872,1.4917,0.2635,4.6748,1.6399,1.2702,5.1734,3.8396,4.0592,1.6871,5.2859,0.2232,0.0014,1.5671,3.8008,0.0122,3.5782,1.2787,3.702,0.9698,3.5178,4.4109,5.8152,1.4736,0.4167,1.3151,5.6723,0.1558,0.6051,0.9019,0.4083,3.92,1.023,4.1259,3.6862,0.0063,3.2479,0.5882,0.0025,3.1264,0.007,3.9506,2.5458,1.7203,2.2206,0.2112,1.9122,0.8281,0.153,4.304,2.2133,1.2901,4.3558,1.1201,2.989,1.3458,1.6746,5.1597,5.241,3.187,3.0628,1.4679,1.6128,1.4931,3.416,2.1812,4.6599,4.3211,1.7706,1.251,1.2162,2.2967,1.0796,5.754,0.3766,1.2721,2.0546,1.057,2.6343,2.4148,0.1889,6.068,2.2797,0.6489,4.86,1.028,2.2694,3.4605,6.7979,2.0489,1.7148,3.8717,1.8564,1.4845,2.3555,4.7553,0.3202,2.2977,1.7283,0.481,1.4658,1.6623,2.4127,0.5847,0.0247,3.2204,2.2419,0.4568,2.7137,3.314,0.8479,2.5383,2.2622,0.6538,4.4455,5.4999,1.1686,3.9995,4.8992,0.7517,2.7995,2.1548,2.1227,0.5015,0.0363,1.7168,3.0658,0.0162,0.9402,0.6801,2.911,3.18,5.8139,1.5354,3.1063,1.3568,0.7671,0.0558,0.002,0.0364,0.1472,0.9118,8.2358,0.8516,2.5366,2.6037,0.0012,2.3614,1.2746,2.2823,0.2853,0.2686,0.0002,3.6503,1.213,2.0227,4.9209,0.477,1.7542,1.1672,1.7639,1.2364,3.3267,2.4869,5.3769,1.1279,5.8717,1.8301,3.3064,0.029,5.0487,1.2432,0.4986,1.3688,1.6834,0.0115,0.0006,1.359,3.1004,0.0631,5.1198,1.415,0.5701,1.0958,0.0134,5.0758,2.3551,0.0001,0.9058,3.8984,3.6417,6.0592,0.4379,3.5591,3.0506,0.004,0.1732,0.6003,2.3706,4.238,1.476,1.3759,0.1362,0.5033,0.3011,0.0019,0.0013,3.7898,4.1735,0.232,3.2968,3.6167,1.3743,1.9446,2.9896,0.9372,0.8674,1.3259,6.1024,0.2678,0.6491,0.8626,3.6972,1.4842,4.8252,0.3411,0.0009,0.0088,5.1798,1.7544,2.8115,1.6813,3.8362,4.3991,2.6017,0.8201,5.8379,0.2969,3.7324,0.024,0.1907,1.6925,2.618,0.7735,4.3495,1.444,1.1247,3.4796,2.1013,1.569,4.9224,0.4172,0.3092,1.208,2.6101,4.7923,0.0084,1.1508,3.1662,0.8922,1.1938,4.4796,3.8447,0.3278,0.5777,0.7761,0.0002,5.4224,1.3277,4.0765,3.9151,1.3165,4.2863,2.8291,1.4439,1.0305,2.8782,0.0161,2.1822,3.1478,3.5964,4.9549,3.3734,4.9217,2.6466,4.4086,4.606,5.2903,0.2199,0.0002,0.7001,4.6001,0.6032,0.9797,1.9138,0.0753,2.1976,0.1183,0.0328,0.0002,0.0004,0.4048,0.4182,0.006,2.0855,0.0024,0.0,1.8947,1.7549,5.8096,4.1118,0.9001,2.1754,3.2774,0.1857,3.6177,3.8595,0.9248,1.6115,4.6057,0.0048,1.9465,0.5403,1.2798,4.5609,2.6811,2.388,0.0031,5.3068,0.2414,1.8939,0.0285,0.0002,0.0,2.2304,0.4455,0.1004,1.2524,0.0715,0.0001,1.6497,6.2914,5.4558,2.1774,3.9716,0.0123,0.3377,0.004,0.0012,0.5863,0.6563,0.0002,2.517,4.298,3.1231,0.2037,0.7304,3.8378,1.3883,4.7626,0.7129,0.0044,2.1125,4.458,0.0059,2.5003,1.6261,1.6865,1.5231,1.5564,0.0,0.0,2.2506,0.5787,2.1713,0.0,0.539,4.7337,0.121,0.0004,0.0183,0.5626,4.9061,0.0004,0.4326,0.9326,4.7858,0.0561,0.0056,0.3947,3.0715,4.4018,0.004,1.4232,1.6321,1.0241,2.6251,3.5715,1.3487,4.7382,1.7043,2.2736,0.724,2.9706,4.4483,0.7072,0.5805,0.6414,4.0078,2.2771,0.4516,0.3371,5.6739,2.1969,0.0122,4.5988,0.3234,5.5393,1.7844,1.7935,0.2458,0.001,0.0003,3.8993,1.4518,1.5482,0.1027,0.7799,0.0002,0.0002,2.175]}

Under Gray, who stepped into the role after Dave Hockaday's five month tenure ended, the youth team has been the focus of a number of academy managers, with many staff being placed in more junior roles while they try to attract players into the academy.\n\nLeeds have also invested heavily in the academy, increasing the number of Under-18 and Under-16 development teams across England and the rest of Europe. Gray made some of the key decisions during those time, including making the Academy Director.\n\nBut when Gray left for Championship side Fulham in April of last year, the future of the Academy was up in the air.\n\nGray left to give the club some clarity on its Academy priorities (having been reluctant to make such changes when he took over), but his replacement Simon Grayson was not able to provide the answers the Club wanted.\n\nHe had planned to bring in an academy director that could be in charge of all three levels of the Club, but to many it was too late.\n\nThe club was without an Academy Director for just 15 months. Grayson would end up leaving on his own terms in April this year after being left at the foot of the table in the League One Play Off Semi final with Blackpool.\n\nThe club took up an option on Grayson's contract at the beginning of this year, meaning that he was now free to explore other interests and opportunities, and he has been linked with a wide-ranging coaching role in League 1 alongside Leeds United head of coaching, Steve Thompson.\n\nIf Leeds United want something more from their Academy they will have to find a way of retaining the services of the man who has done so much for Leeds' Under-18 development team.","token_len":482,"entropy":[8.3801,4.8086,9.0144,0.1138,1.3062,1.6327,6.7027,2.4795,2.9747,6.6067,2.6105,2.1781,1.6749,2.1783,7.7428,1.7534,7.822,0.498,4.1894,6.6366,1.283,0.0009,1.1481,0.6901,2.5855,17.8819,10.2899,11.7148,8.3207,1.3749,3.7606,1.7211,0.0677,0.0656,2.873,5.5611,4.5856,2.6381,3.1951,0.2866,0.8342,0.0055,3.824,2.078,5.156,1.7184,2.7668,0.0037,0.0007,1.8323,1.1268,1.1691,0.4234,0.9071,0.3255,2.6819,3.9642,6.4978,1.615,0.0539,4.1708,3.8569,3.5255,0.1997,1.2247,3.7228,5.6534,0.0152,0.0006,1.3055,5.1472,6.1294,0.9511,3.6197,0.1104,0.7423,3.5755,0.0857,0.001,1.7451,3.6517,0.013,0.0004,0.8118,2.2125,2.639,0.3141,0.0003,3.0517,0.0064,2.9558,4.9184,0.1904,4.279,0.0507,0.0182,2.0205,1.642,2.3049,1.7425,0.3275,2.7937,2.5083,3.802,0.9199,1.4923,4.1385,0.4777,0.4833,0.0003,5.6329,3.6253,3.6239,3.7555,0.0866,1.6897,0.919,0.5277,4.3922,0.1055,6.0886,0.0432,1.8116,1.9391,1.3323,1.2797,0.3397,0.016,2.4945,0.1199,3.655,1.6079,5.3521,0.9627,0.9633,4.2999,5.7541,2.2092,0.3013,0.3282,1.3596,3.8507,0.0094,0.0029,0.0001,1.9567,5.9623,4.2508,1.6217,1.2461,0.7764,1.1034,4.5844,1.9342,1.4649,2.1397,4.0978,2.8909,0.1307,2.0575,1.9317,0.0041,2.4328,5.3694,1.39,1.6742,4.9561,5.121,2.8133,5.3067,1.3073,6.0704,1.6835,1.2848,5.5768,3.2745,4.6085,0.368,5.2347,2.218,4.026,0.2779,1.3462,0.2389,0.2689,0.0003,2.5538,0.0165,1.199,2.2853,4.35,0.7086,0.0965,1.4425,1.9413,1.0474,5.0723,0.998,0.4022,0.0096,5.0977,0.5637,0.9366,1.782,0.0259,0.0057,1.7504,4.4499,2.0656,4.6598,4.3912,1.4243,2.9092,1.8345,0.0011,0.3924,1.0906,4.7382,5.6,4.557,3.1414,0.8234,3.5539,1.2809,4.0121,4.1274,4.3969,0.8754,0.8281,4.0748,1.6987,4.4201,2.322,4.2728,0.3513,0.0003,4.9094,4.2435,0.9564,0.7099,3.4719,4.299,0.5747,4.1552,0.0002,0.83,3.098,3.0277,2.2003,0.0525,0.0881,1.5757,4.0128,0.1224,0.3008,1.3314,1.5286,3.2135,0.1261,0.0054,0.0012,0.4122,0.729,0.0003,2.4628,3.0803,3.6551,6.7799,1.1993,1.5226,3.1116,4.3891,1.5432,2.5947,1.998,5.3494,7.0608,5.1744,2.0529,5.0756,0.0906,2.5978,2.7292,2.2955,3.6319,0.3126,1.9987,0.7555,1.1611,1.0671,3.3307,1.403,3.8995,0.3912,1.708,1.9402,1.6327,0.0029,3.8095,1.2289,2.342,2.3793,4.5414,2.8062,0.4085,0.2289,0.0003,5.0199,2.7616,5.2592,0.2015,3.0656,0.4853,2.7703,1.2647,0.6265,5.4615,1.3622,3.0181,2.2982,0.6267,0.1657,1.2664,2.3874,2.7202,0.384,0.2389,2.6093,2.3386,0.4652,6.0242,5.32,2.4729,1.6251,3.0068,1.7117,0.7757,0.5114,0.0003,2.2522,2.3354,2.6467,4.1149,1.7984,0.5007,0.2636,1.1851,5.4825,6.3065,0.4706,1.5384,5.449,5.3122,5.5117,0.2658,1.6987,4.5594,2.4415,0.061,0.9896,1.6871,2.8998,2.5648,0.0049,2.4104,2.5007,4.3274,4.8371,1.4432,4.5276,0.0059,0.155,1.8999,2.0913,0.5639,3.5235,0.2182,2.9108,2.4106,4.2436,3.783,2.7086,4.7482,0.0004,0.363,0.1778,0.0003,2.2214,1.9803,5.2897,3.8173,1.9325,0.6032,0.9129,3.698,0.2296,0.1731,2.8244,0.3517,3.1501,0.0016,2.2511,1.3547,0.5394,4.1794,1.5073,1.0368,1.8243,3.6227,1.9862,0.0431,4.1063,0.4795,4.6248,2.39,2.9732,2.178,2.3298,2.0245,1.6725,2.2278,1.685,0.2663,0.9501,6.0174,3.6195,0.6933,3.2067,0.4238,1.9577,3.9887,4.3957,6.274,4.1099,1.575,2.8525,0.3271,1.9469,2.6201,2.8264,1.1342,0.199,0.1438,0.0003,4.7161,1.3251,4.0368,3.1955,7.0747,1.5705,2.9995,0.6134,0.5882,3.5931,0.8219,0.6826,0.0155,2.9524,0.9436,2.1454,0.8257,4.2054,1.5473,1.4156,0.022,1.8139,1.2171,0.6139,1.0593,2.8874,0.3898,0.0771,0.9031,3.9627,3.1106,3.9483,0.1761,0.1472,3.4318,2.1096,0.927]}

He often took months to complete a portrait, leaving large periods of inactivity between sittings. With Bertinot's painting that ended the year, he produced a portrait that he knew could be completed in a few short days. But the problem was that the portrait's colour was so poor it looked as though he had done it with'a bucket of black tea'\u2014 and he wasn't sure when the painting had been made. For a moment he could have imagined he looked at the work of his friend and his teacher for the first time \u2014 only it was too late; Bertinot was dead.\n\n\u2014\n\nIt would be easy enough to read the work with a simple eye, turning over each surface to analyse it. But there's a particular quality that can be detected in painting in the 19th century \u2014 the ability to describe its environment and use it to construct a vision. And that's what D\u00fcrer, and later in the century, has taken to doing. He made some of the most successful art of the period. He was not prolific. His output was small, and varied from period to period. But like Durer, he made his art visible, to show us his world, where the human figure is present. When he finished, he returned to work in the studio, and then moved into the country. At his death there was a large estate and an endowment to promote the work. The museum at Giasto has an exhibition on that history as well, and on the relationship between Durer, and especially D\u00fcrer, and Hirst, as an art world figure.\n\nWe have a wonderful display of paintings from Giasto and their relationship to this work of art, at the beginning of the exhibition. We'll have a conversation about that when we come to the exhibition, where we'll begin to see how different styles of art were associated with the work \u2014 different genres of art, each with a different meaning.\n\nYou can see the work, and ask questions, for yourself at the Giasto exhibition; and, it was good to see one of Durer's large portraits of women in the exhibition, too. And I hope you'll take the time you have before you leave town, and go to see this museum.","token_len":482,"entropy":[5.6525,4.2117,9.2939,16.2146,7.2481,5.5463,11.4945,3.5356,9.419,2.5305,3.7505,3.3585,1.2145,0.2689,6.0969,1.1603,2.2197,6.7028,4.8241,7.8236,0.5928,4.9991,1.2404,8.2454,1.6398,6.1997,6.96,5.8596,0.232,4.7258,0.0737,2.2609,7.2537,0.2082,0.0051,0.3413,5.883,10.4128,4.5606,2.1098,1.6725,5.3736,5.6825,5.1361,2.2641,3.7982,1.2556,1.5821,5.8084,1.4943,2.9331,2.7182,3.0915,4.1017,3.6668,0.7538,1.2964,0.879,0.8028,1.6292,4.2892,1.841,0.4895,4.6303,2.2334,4.4657,0.4503,0.6722,1.9023,2.9027,4.1087,5.7213,1.0755,2.572,3.6156,3.5153,2.8026,2.025,1.0608,1.9508,0.3842,4.5592,0.5761,1.1756,13.0713,2.8037,4.9631,0.5195,5.269,6.669,2.0891,3.7817,4.8821,2.3171,3.9009,0.0027,2.2157,4.8883,2.4567,2.1075,2.081,0.4331,2.9563,0.3068,5.0928,2.0877,3.2242,1.0843,4.649,1.9337,3.6126,4.3354,6.3173,2.0,1.451,2.6296,1.6013,2.8321,3.0742,1.5692,4.2529,3.3638,4.1894,0.9967,1.0674,0.0105,6.849,4.2738,3.7533,0.7618,2.9623,0.2101,4.0998,2.8037,0.0034,0.0003,1.5416,1.4041,0.2657,0.9078,0.0208,5.3522,1.8875,0.0001,3.9373,3.7137,0.5842,2.3559,3.5054,0.1885,4.6185,1.6309,3.7317,6.25,1.3647,4.2845,2.1717,1.291,6.0621,3.121,2.2092,4.9004,2.3752,5.0841,2.451,1.6356,1.1519,3.2753,2.1735,1.389,5.566,2.3026,1.8625,4.4291,1.6319,2.3375,0.7418,5.9391,4.0165,1.7918,3.4221,0.0074,0.2056,3.0093,1.6704,3.6419,0.2715,5.3588,5.321,4.1254,2.5668,5.5941,0.9817,0.4585,3.2999,0.874,4.7189,1.2425,3.6024,1.9588,1.1372,0.7441,4.4349,2.3328,0.0469,3.1585,4.1647,3.2108,4.1529,0.9213,1.2687,0.8893,4.8077,6.5988,0.3863,1.4171,0.8324,2.4868,5.5969,5.2318,1.1118,0.8706,0.5234,4.7951,3.7053,0.8492,0.563,2.5697,3.0624,1.9906,1.5119,3.7397,6.3488,2.3427,2.42,2.2869,0.9122,2.6822,1.4175,1.2207,5.7116,4.1776,4.6328,0.0035,0.0143,0.3367,1.0642,5.3524,3.0985,1.227,0.6051,0.6249,2.8075,2.9338,2.6801,5.5,1.6714,3.3398,3.157,1.7695,2.3536,1.0568,1.5125,5.1719,2.073,4.1624,1.7321,1.5564,5.3138,1.7111,4.8977,1.149,3.3676,2.3584,1.0501,5.1652,0.2785,4.2319,2.69,1.214,0.8177,0.931,1.8681,3.9577,3.593,2.3856,1.348,4.0672,1.3572,5.1388,2.5188,0.7949,4.307,1.2157,1.2528,3.2509,4.8315,3.1746,3.2634,5.4812,0.0226,2.2568,4.6912,1.9165,2.5775,1.7295,2.744,4.4487,3.4711,5.1658,8.4204,4.7724,2.5158,2.5954,1.0772,1.6957,5.6629,3.5208,5.1412,0.3034,3.2008,1.4826,3.7394,1.3498,3.5544,0.2686,1.1534,0.4181,2.1415,2.8395,6.108,1.8865,0.1689,0.0019,0.4523,0.3365,6.6264,3.5724,1.4876,3.6064,3.0152,3.7826,3.8393,2.7122,0.3664,0.6346,0.0002,4.7688,2.751,1.7568,4.8282,5.6965,0.6808,3.3469,1.6083,2.9288,0.0904,0.0064,3.3994,4.6951,1.6333,0.5607,5.2794,3.51,2.2652,0.7205,1.9771,5.4534,0.3543,4.2532,0.0556,0.2881,0.6744,0.3519,2.9479,3.8864,1.9568,1.0314,5.4528,1.0878,1.3307,3.7589,0.459,1.3334,1.1866,1.077,2.1676,1.5918,4.9354,0.7955,0.4323,5.5954,0.6291,1.7771,1.8385,4.907,4.4877,1.9234,1.5935,2.7005,4.0424,0.1698,1.4486,1.987,4.1025,5.11,4.4763,1.214,1.5495,1.1268,5.7537,1.0498,1.7084,0.9206,3.2843,0.741,1.1627,0.0002,3.9675,1.6482,1.0795,1.3674,2.373,3.4587,1.1068,4.893,0.3685,0.9212,4.4806,0.9214,1.7373,0.6743,0.8289,0.0678,0.0077,3.0325,5.5018,2.2393,3.8217,4.8203,4.3306,4.5791,0.4394,1.2768,5.2996,0.1022,2.5245,1.2424,0.0248,5.4456,3.5232,2.4187,3.9061,2.3806,1.1812,1.8733,1.4562,3.6951,0.2764,3.3535,2.9596,2.2908,0.991,0.5327,3.6097,0.9135,0.6481,6.5218,0.9522,3.2709,1.9398,0.865,4.8104,2.1551,1.898,2.3693,1.189,1.038,3.1836,4.7879,0.8599]}
{"id":4871,"ended":true,"length":461,"gen_text":"Due to its isolated coastal location, the Isle of Portland has an extensive range of flora and fauna ; the coastline and disused quarries are designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Sea lions are widespread in the estuary and in Portland Harbour, and the harbour seals, harbor porpoises and harbor seals have been photographed in Portland Harbour.\n\nAn interesting feature of the harbour is that the river banks are lined with large stone piles that were erected during times of war so ships could be sunk during a naval fire. Although the stones have now faded, many are still visible and give the impression of the original location. The city has a rich history with two major battles occurring here. In the 18th century, British warships were sent to Portland to repel a small Danish raiding party, which was led by one of King Frederick I's sons. The battle ended with the capture of Portland and the settlement was granted as the Port of Portland after a short battle during the battle, fought and won by the British. As part of the settlement, a temple dedicated to Saint Charles was built, which remained during the occupation period.\n\nThe British settlement was given a new name in 1814, with the British East India Company taking charge of the island. The building of a port was deemed very important for the British overseas empire, and one of the first stages of the plan was the construction of Portland Harbour, which was started in the summer of 1816, during the war of 1812. This is the earliest known port in the region at that time.\n\nAn area that has always inspired many artists is Portland Harbour. Several artists have done work in Portland harbour, and many more artists have expressed their interest in using the harbour, and its art history. In 1883, a large mural was painted for the Queen Victoria State Gallery. One of the most prominent figures in the painting was William Blake, a prominent Irishman and painter. The painting has always intrigued me, especially the figures on the bridge - a British soldier, a sailor and two British women.\n\nIn 1993, The Maritime Trust was formed to encourage the artistic community in Portland to work in the harbour; they help raise public funding for the art exhibitions. Two years later, The Portland Harbour Gallery was introduced.

It then cuts to Brown waking up in a bedroom as he notices a mysterious woman ( played by actress Gabrielle Union in the role), she approaches him and asks Brown to dance for her.\n\nAs Brown dances, the woman asks if he's looking for a date. Brown responds that he is and she tells him she has a place for him to stay. Brown asks if he can sleep on the floor. The woman says it's fine, she's waiting for a man. After some minor talking the woman finally says, \"Hello.\" The person she's speaking to is none other than the main character; a character who would soon become Brown's \"date.\"\n\n[ Related: Is There an International Brown Fansite? ]\n\nBrown meets the woman at the place the group is staying in, which is the home of a group of people that make the movie, who help Brown run the party. As part of their routine, they bring out the music, which is called \"Dance with the Stars.\" Brown meets the girl, Elizabeth (played by Gabrielle Union), who is actually from the show and they dance to the song.\n\nElizabeth is taken aback to hear someone from the TV show asking for help instead of asking her for her number which is common on TV. She starts dancing with Brown and the couple starts dancing again, which leaves the two shocked and angry.

{"id":3668,"ended":false,"length":374,"gen_text":"Reviewers focus most frequently on the dynamic between Norrell and Strange, arguing that the novel is about their relationship. In her review for the Times Literary Supplement, Roz Kaveney writes that the novel 'describes in vivid and heartbreaking detail the kind of relationship that we all need to have in order to make it'. '[The] lovers' love for one another'. The reviewers also note that the novel ends on a 'fantasy cliffhanger' [that] is sure to leave readers wondering just what will happen next'.\n\nAwarding a book the Man Booker Prize has resulted in the author's bestsellers becoming bestsellers. When the prize was first offered the prize was largely for mystery or crime fiction. However since 2007 the award has been awarded twice, to a novel for work that'spires to be a literary novel and to a work that aims to be a brilliant work of literature.'\n\nIn recent years, Booker Prize winner David Mitchell and his long-time collaborator and wife, Lydia Davis, have been awarded the prize. Other author winners include Salman Rushdie for Midnight's Children and Kazuo Ishiguro for The Remains of the Day. James McAlister's The Long Price Quartet, about American soldiers in Vietnam, was awarded the prize in 1998, the first time one of McAlister's books also won the Booker Prize.\n\nThe Man Booker is named after Sir Francis Rolle Knight, a former chairman of the jury, who was appointed in the 1970s.

{"id":4784,"ended":true,"length":444,"gen_text":"The synthesized orchestral score of the episode was written by Christopher Lennertz. He feels that `` people associate the sound of violins with vampires `` due to the `` connection with Eastern Europe and the Ukraine.`` His idea for the new score was that the violins should be like sound of `` animals in the forest.`` Lennertz has provided a short write up about what he did as well as a clip from the opening.\nThe music was arranged by Christopher Lennertz and Peter MacDougall.\nThe score for the opening credits was written by Howard Ashman and it contains three songs that make up the credits sequence. The first one `` In the Time of the Vampire '' is performed by Adam Krier on violin and it has a strong piano influence with a slow build up of tension and a crescendo at the end. The second song is `` I'll Always Have a Home in London.`` This is a very dramatic song that really goes from being emotional and beautiful to being very sad and very serious and there's a very haunting feeling to it. The third song is `` The Beginning of the End '' This is a very upbeat orchestral piece and when it was performed by Peter MacDougall, it was performed as the ending for the episode (in full).\nThe next scene of the opening credits is the closing song, which is performed by the London Philharmonic Society. It is a song sung by Peter Crouch, which is a bit of a misnomer due to the fact that Crouch is actually an American. The song as performed is somewhat more upbeat that the opening piece, it almost has a Beatles-like feel to it. It also has a bit of a swing feel as well as a guitar riff. The score is by Howard Ashman and it is composed at the beginning of the episode and at the very end of the episode.\nThe sound is very important in any successful vampire show. For this show, the music for the opening and closing credits was done by Peter MacDougall. He's also composed music for several of the other episodes, so you know he could bring out the best when it came to music for the show.\nThere's a lot of different music in the episode, and I will do my best to put them in as you listen to them.

{"id":2671,"ended":true,"length":431,"gen_text":"M @ - @ 66 is a four @ - @ lane highway that connects with State Road 9 ( SR 9 ) at the Indiana state line in southern St. Joseph County. The Indiana State Police has designated this intersection as an exit only access only intersection.\n\nThe primary eastbound lane is for traffic leaving Missouri, and is designated as a westbound exit lanes, while a lane of eastbound traffic is designated as a southbound exit lane.\n\nThe highway ends at the junction of US Highway 6 in St. Francis and SR 9 where it leads to the east-west alignment of the SR 9 corridor, and back to Missouri. On the other side of the highway, the US Highway 72 alignment remains on the east side of the Interstate.\n\nThe westbound lane of US 75 is identified as southbound exit Lanes.\n\nAdditional information: Missouri has posted speed limits in the area as well, including a 50 mph limit on both the east and westbound approaches.\n\nTraffic Pattern\n\nThe route of the east side of the highway is controlled by several curves.\n\nU.S. Highway 2 runs through a portion of the east side of Interstate 70 from its junction with I-70 to the junction with US 2.\n\nThe curve in I-70 where the US 75 roadway ends near Highway 22 is also located on the east side of Interstate 70.\n\nU.S. 2 passes through an area of open hills and plains with a very low population density. The areas of grass and crops are most prominent. The two major highways, Highway 78 and Interstate 69, cross the Missouri River and reach St. Louis from the south.\n\nThis approach to the interstate, and the approach to the US 75 roadway on the west side of the interstate are relatively flat and low-density. The north entrance to the Missouri River bridge span crosses I-70 on the west side of the bridge span. On the west side of Interstate 70, the entrance to I-74 runs almost directly out south. There is little development in the area.\n\nThese features account for traffic patterns which are typically very limited. If traffic jams, or any other traffic problems arise, they must be resolved rapidly and completely. The Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) has an important part to play in working with federal agencies to improve traffic flow and safety on this important corridor.","token_len":485,"entropy":[9.0572,6.7828,7.9657,8.2936,9.1488,2.2018,7.2565,9.5132,2.7975,1.4136,9.4836,6.576,2.9522,2.5227,4.6641,5.1796,1.9995,4.4767,3.5027,8.0976,0.2354,0.8717,1.4157,1.3755,7.3229,1.5743,0.1179,2.8061,3.5394,6.1277,0.1183,1.3531,0.0986,0.5582,1.4942,4.013,2.3342,0.8022,3.0647,3.4868,1.0893,4.0338,0.1783,1.8878,4.1801,2.2214,4.8396,4.3562,2.1743,0.7473,1.9675,0.016,2.5656,5.7057,3.8819,0.7482,2.4454,1.8977,2.3769,3.1021,3.2461,6.0918,2.3364,1.6338,2.8611,2.8183,0.5665,1.4516,3.6926,0.018,1.8194,6.5419,3.5575,1.5577,4.6355,3.913,3.1325,2.7132,0.0041,0.2863,0.7165,0.0993,0.1218,0.4307,2.2047,0.0038,0.7463,0.4248,0.1931,1.2221,0.0002,1.1709,5.8845,4.4638,0.54,0.9669,5.2548,0.7531,3.2277,3.2278,4.2932,3.2397,2.0467,0.0243,5.8184,2.2071,3.2568,0.4933,5.9077,1.2248,5.9157,0.4244,1.0783,3.3648,3.089,0.0287,4.7209,0.2902,1.8179,3.8608,0.4328,2.4147,3.2077,1.6831,5.5488,0.2804,1.5128,0.2643,5.8619,0.7715,2.4122,0.1466,0.2151,0.4146,1.2278,0.8742,1.0275,5.115,0.5162,4.7963,2.5665,4.8877,4.4938,0.4713,1.7485,0.5524,0.4103,0.3421,5.1019,1.2616,0.3923,0.0002,1.732,3.838,0.1149,2.8965,1.2865,2.5208,5.7488,1.072,6.6982,0.2763,5.3514,0.0366,0.8319,7.0152,0.0073,1.7117,1.0729,0.0002,4.8024,0.8859,2.4809,3.5595,6.2263,4.3949,4.4675,0.725,2.6919,1.3343,1.4443,3.2052,1.472,1.8215,3.0399,1.9423,3.3836,0.9761,1.0906,0.8401,3.1128,2.1749,1.7011,0.5988,0.0301,1.4326,3.28,1.5546,0.9451,0.0002,5.0897,0.0342,5.4179,0.9078,0.0002,1.4054,5.4431,1.7771,0.7557,4.4624,4.6908,0.4497,0.6147,1.3695,1.1931,5.1795,0.2497,5.3175,5.8188,2.1583,2.0817,0.0002,5.6063,0.865,0.0132,0.0333,0.7073,6.1783,3.2597,2.558,2.4329,4.7536,0.0113,0.4772,2.9287,0.1949,0.184,4.9688,1.3061,3.6155,3.2855,0.4259,0.094,2.1122,0.0193,0.7231,1.3936,1.073,2.672,0.2878,1.5334,5.4555,1.4078,1.2005,0.0002,1.8131,3.8609,2.6398,3.7651,0.005,0.1913,4.3044,1.7789,3.4174,0.8006,5.3453,2.1128,5.222,4.9903,4.7189,0.6638,3.2311,3.3246,0.8851,0.2681,0.2331,0.0257,0.0399,1.7424,0.0636,0.3602,0.2985,0.0002,2.5316,0.0023,0.0023,0.0105,5.4297,5.1693,0.7469,2.9571,0.6642,0.733,5.136,4.9476,1.2048,4.6832,2.9507,1.8417,4.4271,2.8695,1.7109,0.2547,0.4133,2.1048,5.5732,1.2061,4.6198,1.4434,4.6992,1.0203,5.5808,3.7207,2.5885,1.9959,5.4697,2.7472,1.9837,2.8905,3.6747,4.6404,0.1695,2.9897,2.8133,0.2388,2.6651,0.7634,4.406,0.5918,2.6537,4.9699,5.0678,0.0111,1.9715,1.6953,0.5519,2.0825,0.352,0.6696,0.0002,4.4245,6.0492,0.8754,0.8433,2.0721,4.3219,3.3178,0.8372,4.4709,0.2949,0.6339,3.7011,0.4248,2.6962,4.6124,0.1385,0.8171,0.0728,0.3438,0.5986,1.6217,2.8389,5.1972,0.6355,1.2523,4.481,1.2634,2.1734,0.4965,1.6059,5.2074,5.108,0.4233,0.8293,3.2426,0.4092,2.096,5.2852,5.0016,3.6663,0.0047,0.2599,2.8515,0.6128,1.0721,0.09,0.3141,0.445,4.3938,1.6203,0.5557,4.9093,0.0792,2.7508,0.117,0.1133,3.1093,0.808,0.408,0.7346,4.2011,0.1529,2.4592,0.0063,2.5944,2.72,6.1795,1.2731,6.6323,6.5354,2.849,4.1799,0.7417,3.2991,3.0966,1.4976,0.8742,0.3783,1.0868,0.4328,0.0002,5.7137,4.243,5.6769,0.0102,5.8921,0.798,3.9905,1.0535,4.352,2.2763,5.9022,1.0906,5.3157,2.0382,5.3192,5.1701,2.6009,3.8839,0.6014,2.3014,1.1978,2.7021,0.2614,1.4864,4.0092,0.1169,2.5574,4.9075,2.1753,5.3612,0.4934,2.8885,3.3771,0.3213,0.0041,0.054,1.4384,1.8341,0.01,0.0003,0.0471,1.6496,4.2433,5.1153,5.4967,0.5665,0.0027,0.1159,5.684,0.3187,6.1331,2.7764,1.0096,3.0169,1.2913,0.852,2.0035,1.3106,1.1525,1.3263,2.8812,2.1395,0.1536]}
{"id":3054,"ended":true,"length":435,"gen_text":"In 1997 an outbreak of respiratory disease occurred in Malaysian farmers and their pigs. More than 265 cases of encephalitis, of which 105 were fatal, were recorded. A new paramyxovirus was discovered in poultry in that same year. The disease was caused by the paramyxovirus-like virus with a genetic similarity to the encephalitis viruses.\nAn outbreak in the United Kingdom (UK) in 1995\u20131997 showed that two serogroups were important [ 5 ] ( Figure ). One of these serogroups was found on swabbings from pigs housed at a pig farming farm in North Wales in the UK. The other serogroup was found on swabs of pigs in Australia that had died of a respiratory disease. The majority of infections with the second serogroup were found on pigs in China.\nA new variant of the swine lung virus was identified in 2008 ( Table ) [ 6 ]. The variant was related to the encephalitis virus from sheep and goats and appeared to be transmitted between pigs, rather than between humans and animals.\nThere were at least ten deaths during the outbreaks, including those in Australia and China, and in 1997 the World Trade Organization imposed a ban on the export of live pigs to China based on the World Organization for Animal Health's notification ( Figure ).\nThe new variant of the swine lung virus has also been introduced into sheep in China and now may be capable of infecting humans.\nIn 2009 the World Organization for Animal Health had confirmed the presence of antibodies in the blood of a swine farm worker, following that incident as well as the 2007 case that resulted in an outbreak in Australia and China. An outbreak in China in 2004 showed that the risk of the human form of encephalitis would increase if people continue to eat pigs.\nIn 2010 a new serogroup was found in humans in the United States [ 7 ]. Unlike the previous serogroup, this variant had a genetic similarity to the encephalitis viruses from sheep and goats [ 8 ]. In June 2011 the WHO reported the presence of antibodies in the blood of a swine farm worker in China, following an outbreak in the United States, with a serotype similar to one isolated from China in the 1990s.\nThe encephalitis virus is now known to be a member of the paramyxovirus group, but its role in human encephalitis is still unknown.","token_len":486,"entropy":[7.2186,6.2414,5.1752,0.1304,5.3051,1.7252,2.7682,0.6043,10.7005,6.1711,2.5142,2.6139,4.3629,1.1034,5.6083,0.1262,9.4,2.9229,0.7479,7.3556,0.0018,0.026,1.6027,5.194,0.0716,5.2755,0.6408,0.1034,0.0537,0.3124,2.3846,0.9431,3.2224,4.1385,11.6463,0.6961,0.0161,0.0245,1.1046,2.8032,0.8553,4.9107,1.5392,5.1593,1.7585,0.0461,0.73,1.9835,2.8765,0.9921,3.0712,0.0236,1.6549,2.5142,0.006,0.0009,0.1099,2.9059,0.6578,2.0161,5.1548,1.1087,3.1595,0.9606,0.082,0.7643,3.0156,0.0009,0.0488,3.0826,1.3863,1.9877,12.532,1.0993,3.5274,2.7767,1.6897,1.1087,3.6879,1.3466,0.0333,0.7402,3.7119,2.909,2.7993,4.9625,0.8938,5.018,3.5994,1.8092,0.1978,2.484,4.8604,6.9997,5.317,2.7806,2.5261,4.5503,2.1552,3.1848,1.0417,0.7888,1.0517,0.1072,0.1247,1.0703,3.3558,5.1055,4.1292,7.636,0.3386,0.8937,0.9552,6.0703,2.1029,1.4682,2.1814,5.0981,2.9868,0.5268,3.6002,2.1038,2.8017,2.7631,0.6884,0.5887,1.0883,1.1947,0.5664,0.0417,0.0064,0.2541,0.6155,0.5308,0.4018,0.8529,2.5425,1.1431,2.2293,5.0712,3.2562,0.8659,2.5797,0.9989,2.4899,2.0353,0.5087,0.7739,1.4436,5.3081,0.0506,4.2156,3.303,0.833,3.2105,0.1308,0.0214,0.0052,0.8167,2.6718,1.4344,1.2002,1.5841,3.8274,0.9943,1.4326,2.9015,2.3804,3.6634,0.0784,0.7768,4.075,0.1411,5.8938,0.1958,1.4152,1.8869,0.1465,5.0235,3.3022,2.9691,1.8907,0.3737,0.5197,0.4676,1.3307,2.1317,1.1312,3.8141,0.0148,0.378,3.0617,0.001,0.0328,0.9156,3.8531,5.6198,1.2485,1.755,1.7465,4.8296,0.1003,0.6115,3.1409,1.8233,0.7287,2.7218,3.8677,0.0024,0.6038,2.7346,2.0294,2.5692,0.299,1.1498,4.1498,2.1799,3.9247,0.0048,4.8216,4.9819,4.3595,0.796,3.8126,2.7388,2.552,3.3165,2.6412,2.5486,1.0841,0.8388,1.5365,1.2294,4.0816,4.8209,2.0621,2.8627,4.1641,0.5396,1.9047,0.7194,0.802,0.048,1.3293,2.1298,0.0538,1.6343,0.8512,1.4341,2.3947,5.7594,0.028,1.0708,5.368,2.5724,0.0541,0.0014,0.0008,1.5978,5.7323,5.4364,2.3059,0.4008,1.1874,1.7054,4.0732,0.9988,0.4591,0.2779,0.3746,0.0001,0.3026,0.0106,2.3929,3.5426,0.2485,6.3749,0.3354,3.9199,1.8297,1.9052,1.8523,5.1175,5.0827,0.8606,5.7758,0.0025,1.2449,0.0014,2.1473,0.821,1.0942,2.4361,2.5494,1.8065,1.9307,2.1713,0.0321,0.0025,0.0015,5.7546,3.6943,1.5717,1.4242,0.0561,6.4226,1.6641,2.6841,1.0976,0.2642,2.1495,3.2064,0.0016,2.1737,0.312,3.3733,6.1002,6.1453,5.5958,5.9118,0.4693,0.1103,1.7976,4.4026,2.5726,4.2979,3.8618,0.1143,3.0573,0.579,1.2541,1.9862,2.5498,0.9515,0.9684,5.0272,0.9527,1.1654,1.66,0.8545,4.5011,2.8403,0.5212,1.0895,5.2995,0.3844,3.1881,4.3254,2.5479,0.0993,3.3117,0.0004,0.0028,5.6867,1.2754,1.2682,4.024,4.6077,0.0274,1.4603,2.3768,1.8742,0.801,1.7442,2.0396,1.7323,1.2261,3.6454,0.127,0.0019,1.1495,1.8549,0.306,4.7747,1.7531,2.0788,1.2651,0.5221,1.613,0.1247,0.5072,6.3518,0.2917,1.9935,0.4713,0.008,1.437,0.5672,0.7056,1.6601,2.7561,0.7888,1.45,0.1599,0.0626,0.3373,1.3446,0.0002,0.007,0.8709,1.2588,0.875,0.1913,0.0608,3.0113,0.2333,0.2769,3.2773,5.0451,1.0159,1.4475,2.5675,1.8684,1.8722,2.2754,0.0536,0.6176,0.5546,0.9553,0.1495,0.1251,0.5728,1.5661,0.0001,0.2359,0.0202,0.7797,1.5842,1.6858,1.3632,2.4243,0.4122,0.6871,2.3496,1.1654,0.1785,2.7593,3.423,1.7779,3.1138,2.1035,0.7171,0.0079,5.8761,4.9445,0.7698,3.7444,0.5483,3.4035,2.5294,0.0218,1.4426,0.9557,1.781,5.4409,0.0009,0.0217,0.4853,1.7825,3.3512,2.6881,0.039,0.6789,1.9772,2.6478,0.005,0.2775,3.2996,0.0017,0.0002,0.3263,2.6923,1.4145,3.6049,2.6274,2.5476,0.2126,1.1322,2.3826,0.0003,0.009,0.942,1.1011,1.3255,0.1302]}

{"id":3312,"ended":false,"length":442,"gen_text":"From Harrisville, NY 812 travels north through an area of Pitcairn and Fowler. This area contains numerous small lakes and rivers and is predominantly rural in nature. Within Fowler, the route travels through three distinct districts in the center of the town, each with its own distinct history. Harrisville was known as the \"Capital of America\" for many years and has an active cemetery.\n\nThis section of the trail ends at the West County Trailhead at the end of West County Road. The West County Trailhead will also have signage stating that it is a trailhead that can accommodate bicycle, foot and equestrian traffic. As we enter Fowler you will leave the western side of Harrisville and be traveling on the East side of the town. At the top of Fowler there are numerous beautiful lakes and ponds that provide a beautiful setting. As you ride along the East side of the town you will reach the end of the West County Trailway. There are several entrances from Harrisville and some are accessible from the West County Trailhead. We recommend following the East side of the West County Trailway into the village of Fowler.\n\nFrom Harrisville Road in the West County Road, follow West County Road towards the village of Fowler. At the entrance to Fowler County Park your bike registration tag (found on your bike in the basket), will be validated by the park service. The rest of the trip will consist of easy bike trails that will put you on an easy trip. The Fowler County Park is home to the Historic Harrisville Hiking Trail and two large lakes, Lake Fowler and Lake Harrisville. They are beautiful and will help you get to know Fowler better.\n\nWe hope that you enjoyed our first installment of Bicycle Trails of New York State. In the next installment, we are going to take a look at New York State's most famous bicycle route in the Adirondacks. For now we hope that these first two pages gave you a general idea of what is involved when you want to bike across North America. If you are interested in traveling through one region or another of the country, we recommend that you do so on a trail system that is well maintained and with a knowledgeable guide on hand to help.\n\nWritten by: Tim Hoey and Paul Kaczorowski\n\nCopyright, Tim Hoey and Paul Kaczorowski, All rights reserved\n\nAdvertisements","token_len":487,"entropy":[10.628,5.6394,0.8194,5.4279,7.7363,4.854,15.9455,2.9116,2.6431,5.8894,1.4305,1.0012,11.3056,0.4638,0.0114,3.0781,11.5881,3.7174,3.3933,2.1184,3.9503,3.7428,3.0834,3.4261,0.9019,3.247,2.3248,1.1463,6.6377,5.0924,3.0394,0.938,0.119,6.7755,8.0832,0.8885,1.4368,2.644,2.1113,0.8611,5.0556,3.5481,3.5968,5.3631,1.1905,4.6365,0.1473,0.3469,1.1622,2.0318,1.9633,0.8779,1.2627,0.039,1.8426,3.1102,0.6696,2.9036,0.028,2.6403,4.8285,0.4797,1.299,0.9321,4.5688,0.1078,3.5508,0.2292,1.8157,2.1788,0.1801,1.3668,2.7066,3.0239,3.4732,4.7396,1.2259,2.463,0.0061,3.9684,2.2226,0.598,0.5119,2.9705,5.237,0.5929,0.8467,5.6354,5.1134,3.3863,0.4212,2.0517,1.0972,2.6856,0.0045,4.1022,1.1901,0.1754,1.8321,1.6481,1.075,0.0243,0.086,0.4325,4.7545,2.8595,4.0554,3.8397,5.3747,1.5051,1.2518,0.237,1.2815,2.9416,0.2775,4.4659,2.8323,3.0236,4.407,2.6186,2.2869,0.9586,3.2983,0.0041,0.0016,0.9719,0.1639,5.6103,4.8212,3.2826,3.6946,5.2289,0.4632,6.6675,0.3936,5.4923,1.8041,0.0159,2.141,0.0281,0.6114,4.9063,2.8206,2.73,0.7171,4.019,0.9006,0.307,0.4606,0.6273,0.3644,3.8651,0.7515,3.9583,0.0158,2.052,3.8786,1.2772,3.2521,5.0424,2.5963,0.7393,1.7961,2.3228,2.4792,1.3704,2.3784,1.6725,2.3848,4.0702,0.3097,4.2411,1.515,0.5165,2.758,0.1045,0.0691,0.7923,0.4862,0.7646,0.2158,3.2514,0.8014,2.6749,0.0183,0.4239,1.2277,0.0563,0.3163,6.6572,0.7518,3.676,0.9512,1.7459,5.5766,4.0127,2.539,0.018,1.7596,3.5051,2.389,3.1566,1.2242,0.6585,0.8037,0.0667,0.0771,2.0115,0.2604,3.4292,1.1458,4.3259,0.1513,1.6284,0.4968,0.1667,0.1998,1.6114,0.0211,0.0663,0.2008,4.1616,1.4004,3.2963,0.3483,0.4184,0.5771,1.0331,0.0002,2.1049,2.8979,0.002,7.4978,5.2545,1.3604,3.0197,0.318,3.2693,1.9796,1.7037,2.5101,0.0531,0.0468,5.009,1.0357,2.7266,0.0746,0.1396,0.1981,2.1638,0.1641,4.8404,0.2318,0.745,7.1755,1.0057,6.2983,2.4034,7.7825,4.23,4.2049,4.6628,1.1521,1.2598,1.1973,3.7125,0.356,3.8766,3.78,1.1099,0.4201,3.7106,2.3931,0.6642,1.3179,3.4556,0.3557,2.3347,6.1287,0.0324,0.3492,3.9931,1.641,4.2807,0.0211,4.8341,3.3811,3.0205,1.8917,1.6514,5.6334,0.3256,1.6839,3.4242,1.336,6.224,1.2335,2.1126,4.6922,1.0343,0.1796,0.8589,3.5217,0.0124,2.0073,6.2285,2.6178,0.0248,5.107,0.8621,0.1294,1.4877,5.8202,4.3469,1.5386,2.3933,2.5437,3.1182,0.066,0.3616,2.1705,0.7832,0.1043,5.9561,0.3892,3.6846,1.0785,3.9888,3.6355,0.9077,1.6852,2.4598,0.1084,3.278,2.9545,0.2029,0.8321,0.0002,3.706,2.1931,1.5165,0.6976,2.2318,1.9101,3.7451,2.8608,0.4032,4.0145,2.7074,0.6064,1.2026,0.0386,1.161,0.503,3.4492,0.5929,0.5779,0.3011,1.449,0.1019,4.0769,0.5938,0.0115,2.0235,0.3457,0.3955,0.0287,3.7402,0.0716,1.2393,0.456,3.4867,2.6972,1.4353,1.6817,4.3758,0.6984,1.2133,0.0,0.0,0.1681,0.9909,4.9932,1.5515,2.9206,1.3977,0.9465,4.547,3.4279,0.6042,5.3413,3.9104,0.011,0.5085,3.7979,0.3416,0.1932,0.8013,2.1461,2.0782,1.7617,1.3077,3.0387,0.0083,2.0311,3.0662,5.1223,0.0567,0.4154,1.9786,0.1018,2.7813,0.8801,0.0284,5.0203,3.8207,3.9785,6.5376,1.9734,1.088,1.0395,0.6102,1.4152,0.7894,1.5067,1.8407,0.8215,0.0095,3.6423,2.0,1.3877,0.4822,3.7074,1.8128,0.4914,1.2551,1.6688,0.4931,0.5761,3.8116,1.0202,3.2416,0.809,3.1646,1.7513,0.9081,1.4088,3.8278,1.5601,0.0002,5.0973,0.1829,1.2614,4.7687,4.3245,4.0143,0.7068,2.1969,4.7431,4.2222,5.4406,0.1036,1.6512,0.1269,0.9061,0.0003,5.1932,4.1856,2.5705,0.1293,0.0003,0.0045,0.3466,0.0146,0.0048,0.0057,0.0008,0.0017,0.0056,1.0584,2.6132,2.6406,0.0555,1.4698,0.0002,3.0662]}

In 1920, he was a member of teams which won the state prep @ - @ school championship and three times that spring participated in the Tullahoma State Fair.\n\nWhile in college, Bomar played for the U.S. Army in France and Germany. In 1926, he played for the Detroit Wolverines in the first annual football match between Detroit and Ann Arbor. As a member of the team he made a tackle on the opening kickoff and later returned a kickoff 84 yards for a touchdown.\n\nHe was commissioned as second lieutenant in the Army on December 7, 1926. In the following year he joined the 1st Division Infantry Band and played trumpet, with which he also served tours in Spain and France. During his tour with the Band, he was asked to be the group's military liaison with Washington.\n\nDuring the early decades of the 1940's, Bomar and his wife lived in Ann Arbor, where they ran a theater and radio program.\n\nOn April 14, 1942, at 14 years of age, Bomar was given a commission as a second lieutenant in the Army. He served until 1943, when he was shot through the thigh by a German machine gunner during a counterattack in Normandy, France. His service, however, also included two tours in Africa. He had been sent there as a \"war correspondent\" working for the U.S. Army.\n\nHe died there of his wounds on February 29, 1944, following a two-month battle involving more than 10,000 Allied Army troops and two German-held areas of Normandy. It was during that first battle that he wrote \" The Death of General Montgomery,\" a book that chronicles his time with the U.S. Army.\n\nAmong those in attendance at Bomber's funeral were his mother Julia (Beverly) and three brothers George L. (Dole), John F. (McMahon), and William P. (Peters)\n\nThe monument was unveiled by Commander-in-Chief U.S. Air Force Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower. A replica of the monument has been moved from where it stood at the original Bomber monument and now stands near the site of the actual memorial, where its placement is intended to reflect the Bomber's role in ending the war.","token_len":487,"entropy":[7.6588,4.6916,8.0853,7.7768,11.1183,0.0014,0.3683,1.5557,1.4922,11.3516,4.8688,8.2707,6.4783,0.5597,0.8295,5.8625,3.8284,0.0003,0.2659,0.7904,0.7491,2.7716,5.5378,0.407,0.4149,2.328,4.5697,1.5529,0.0068,10.9415,4.2733,0.9175,0.5629,3.7378,8.3873,15.319,8.0804,8.8589,5.1209,0.996,1.9543,6.4429,3.9775,4.8916,6.8892,5.3823,0.077,0.2233,4.757,0.0867,0.0016,2.3651,2.5936,0.4474,1.9218,0.0129,4.2994,1.6746,2.1846,0.2031,0.9552,0.0022,2.0633,1.7093,0.541,4.3046,0.0251,0.0523,0.0095,1.1159,3.059,1.9424,1.5661,2.3095,0.9597,1.7152,4.0133,0.2331,0.2645,4.5365,0.8095,0.203,5.7453,3.3682,0.0004,1.605,0.3095,2.7293,4.6838,4.4931,3.6056,1.0135,3.2776,0.147,4.8673,0.0036,0.5256,4.827,0.3973,1.7387,0.0038,0.1549,2.8613,3.0304,4.0281,1.9903,1.2887,1.9492,1.1498,3.3161,0.2235,1.4956,3.0243,1.994,1.0636,0.8475,5.1687,0.0093,0.5258,0.1461,0.1494,0.2764,1.116,0.0002,3.0596,1.6254,3.6822,1.3118,2.3081,0.0229,0.4737,0.1046,1.7239,2.2796,2.8327,3.3552,0.0353,1.2341,0.7526,2.2132,2.5142,2.9695,0.8014,1.0395,3.9822,0.1174,4.0171,0.043,2.713,2.4112,6.5174,1.5978,1.7595,2.8185,2.5443,5.8459,2.2309,0.0466,3.4362,2.4106,5.959,0.8111,4.3235,0.5208,0.9258,0.156,3.496,1.9596,1.7514,3.2682,0.0585,1.4757,0.4753,0.4345,1.5705,5.7149,0.2427,3.6939,1.1866,5.5103,0.2188,4.8232,1.8125,1.9012,4.6301,1.1981,1.2276,0.0002,3.0511,0.86,3.4822,7.6651,0.0187,0.5094,4.304,1.3875,0.3549,0.5661,0.0006,4.3521,0.453,0.9129,2.984,0.2426,3.9011,0.0311,0.7141,2.3053,1.893,3.7022,0.3374,5.5405,1.3288,4.4938,4.2017,1.1413,2.7436,0.0002,2.0989,2.46,3.357,0.0245,2.3297,0.1188,3.0873,5.7688,0.8716,0.6329,0.0018,0.0579,0.9927,0.0002,1.0896,3.9101,1.3163,1.0458,0.6232,0.959,0.7704,0.0061,0.3663,0.011,1.5259,1.2845,1.1887,1.6673,3.5037,3.6465,0.9568,0.8422,0.1481,0.3848,5.6222,2.7879,0.0597,4.5224,1.3465,0.6851,1.5553,2.6357,0.1688,2.51,2.1086,1.049,4.8288,0.8159,1.9365,2.7169,2.2266,0.1086,0.093,3.3694,5.0138,4.6371,2.3253,0.0309,5.6671,0.9765,3.4244,1.0816,0.8121,4.2187,1.3138,2.5685,4.6393,1.5898,4.6953,2.0529,1.8301,0.8281,4.2618,4.6179,0.4951,0.5687,5.8933,0.4722,0.6066,1.8814,0.0058,0.009,0.0096,1.0909,2.413,0.6779,0.0002,2.5981,3.694,4.6551,2.7157,0.6029,0.4272,0.532,3.3856,4.2326,0.0151,1.6033,1.1349,5.2494,0.5725,4.2565,0.2825,1.5472,2.1083,6.8207,2.8068,0.0207,3.2559,0.1267,0.012,1.4157,5.7059,1.2504,3.0863,5.211,1.9934,5.2402,1.856,5.0491,0.9131,1.9948,0.1648,4.9586,0.4286,2.7031,2.5786,5.118,1.0389,0.4128,0.8154,6.5061,2.9469,8.0484,4.7687,0.2924,1.4903,3.5496,2.3044,1.3787,2.0213,1.917,3.8261,0.0106,0.9269,3.1918,1.789,0.3448,2.1424,0.0009,0.002,0.0094,0.0869,0.9584,0.3945,0.0002,5.6617,2.6475,4.3677,0.7144,0.4207,5.5046,0.598,0.4207,0.9354,1.3413,2.9392,6.5724,3.3144,2.6509,6.3423,0.164,0.2316,1.1522,4.4898,1.3619,5.2376,6.6855,0.7222,0.3399,3.6353,5.9076,1.4772,3.1132,3.245,0.0258,0.3403,5.2068,3.3462,0.5274,2.1449,0.0233,3.3929,3.5595,0.0257,0.0673,2.9136,4.0377,2.2733,3.3019,0.0002,2.6424,5.4711,1.9165,1.8955,1.3597,5.9616,2.4181,0.0234,0.0066,0.0164,1.9765,0.2738,0.0311,0.0028,3.2409,0.14,1.2225,0.0188,2.7286,0.1455,0.0057,0.0013,1.913,3.9712,5.6866,0.24,0.3858,1.2297,3.6358,0.3069,4.7172,2.388,4.8872,0.4115,1.0309,1.3193,0.6839,4.895,2.1992,3.778,1.9986,2.3298,0.4048,2.6939,0.3755,3.058,0.4605,0.6018,4.755,2.2207,2.6552,2.5669,4.6998,3.5651,1.3484,4.4435,0.0342,3.296,0.8503,4.3541,0.2157,3.4198,0.4306,5.2761,0.9704,0.1399,0.3814]}
{"id":568,"ended":false,"length":451,"gen_text":"Desperate Housewives focuses on the lives of several residents living on Wisteria Lane. In recent episodes, Susan ( Teri Hatcher ) and Mike Delfino ( James Denton ) celebrate the birth of their son, but one of their closest friends, Mary (Maggie Q), is dealing with her own impending second child and is also desperate to have the baby, as the first one is not producing as much milk as she would like. During the first half of the season, the group struggles to pay the bills.\n\nThe show is based on the real-life characters of J.W. O'Keefe, Mimi Delfino, Mary Lou Delfino, and L.J. Delfino, who came to New Jersey in the 1950s, with their two teenage daughters, in an attempt to build a better life. As a result, the Delfino family is one of the most successful in the state and are known for their sense of togetherness, loyalty and hard work.\n\nThe producers, however, have attempted to modernize the show to appeal to a broad audience. They have also tried to make the show more family friendly.\n\nThe show's characters often make impromptu guest appearances, like last week's reunion with Jim and Susan (in full drag) on the set where they have been filming. When asked by The Hollywood Reporter (Hollywood, CA) what the chances were of them being able to reunite, the actresses both said: \"Good. [laughs] Good\".\n\n\"We've definitely tried to bring that home as much as we can,\" Maggie said. \"The best one for me is just making sure that you're the oldest [and] the oldest, then you can introduce the other kids and you're still their mother and this is how you know each other better. It's all in the details [of your appearance]. If we're taking off our clothes and standing in front of each other we're still the same person\u2026 Even the girls I met. The little girls, it's just so sweet with kids. I was like, 'I can't believe people are still having this.'\"\n\nMeanwhile, Maggie said the reunion itself was \"a lot of laughter and tears and tears.\" Asked if she was hoping for a second reunion in the future, Maggie said: \"I can't imagine anything but yes.\"","token_len":488,"entropy":[2.427,4.851,0.0747,11.7151,0.1852,0.9224,1.8006,0.0618,4.4337,6.6725,3.6986,2.9098,8.3052,2.3947,0.0006,0.0721,2.1541,3.6312,6.2445,2.235,0.2048,7.7738,1.6861,11.6286,0.0274,0.84,0.0005,0.3689,1.4079,5.2988,10.4489,4.5881,0.0069,0.1047,4.7394,4.0091,3.2462,0.1118,8.3182,2.0052,2.0016,0.0281,0.1809,1.5985,0.9209,3.1753,5.4705,1.1303,1.1541,3.9296,0.1868,0.4843,4.7102,0.6671,4.8672,1.9704,0.0007,3.4906,0.3998,1.1,3.5953,0.004,2.0014,0.606,5.9884,5.6213,1.8155,2.6901,2.1319,4.017,5.1806,0.5652,1.0854,3.5768,0.4556,3.0754,2.8602,3.131,3.0277,1.0105,1.7127,2.9226,4.4026,2.7607,1.7662,1.6,0.7059,1.1923,1.213,0.1029,0.0537,5.8428,1.0364,2.8613,2.3215,0.0301,0.1778,0.3728,0.0461,1.624,3.5909,2.7589,0.3571,5.848,1.1584,0.4812,3.0792,1.9933,0.0111,1.7141,1.8816,1.8388,1.9659,0.0643,0.5871,2.0311,0.534,0.0056,3.6457,0.4328,5.9498,2.1333,2.2615,0.0114,4.8244,0.1105,4.5083,0.6584,4.3938,3.2449,3.1901,0.0256,0.0002,0.5038,2.8346,5.7476,0.5783,0.0015,0.0002,0.5274,0.8575,5.1748,3.6143,0.7481,0.0067,0.4909,0.0014,0.0006,1.1844,1.1326,5.0342,0.4175,2.3083,2.5521,1.5576,0.7258,2.3392,0.0174,2.9453,4.3299,1.3162,2.3103,3.939,0.8718,0.8818,3.7729,2.843,0.7162,0.0102,3.8924,0.2042,1.1259,0.032,1.1138,4.586,2.3279,0.5998,0.5152,1.0944,1.7107,0.0101,1.5319,0.7579,2.6676,2.7906,0.0301,0.1342,1.0675,2.0873,0.9629,0.5622,1.1958,2.7261,4.3899,3.1765,0.7405,0.5595,5.9055,0.0013,5.8161,0.0016,1.5356,3.4767,2.1126,2.5408,0.0539,0.1358,0.6947,0.0002,1.466,5.2833,4.0019,2.9641,0.006,1.5856,5.0538,0.0333,5.1284,0.0072,0.1802,0.9348,2.8534,1.1327,0.0523,0.7339,4.792,0.302,0.7633,3.3466,0.8046,1.9024,2.2659,0.0526,2.1279,0.5114,1.1252,0.5431,1.4394,1.4447,1.7503,1.7808,0.0002,1.4447,1.1862,1.9297,5.0068,3.4794,3.4188,4.7526,0.9581,4.3604,0.0235,2.3131,4.3826,5.026,0.6864,0.9124,5.0547,1.8113,5.8429,1.2644,3.2709,3.9534,4.0081,5.3199,3.1326,1.3343,3.523,0.9686,2.8531,5.0935,1.1101,3.7725,1.2351,0.9265,1.6252,5.394,2.6071,2.33,3.6266,1.2454,0.01,6.6298,3.8417,0.8028,1.3268,1.4027,0.0869,2.2732,1.7473,4.7705,1.698,0.8253,2.794,3.273,1.8938,0.0031,2.9832,0.0001,1.2083,1.7619,4.1803,3.3844,0.9829,3.8282,0.1282,4.8955,2.1759,5.0267,2.8831,0.3047,3.5989,6.2789,0.3904,0.0002,2.9954,1.5067,2.2765,5.1889,3.1958,0.1287,3.2499,4.2392,4.3136,4.8041,0.1353,0.0073,0.4965,0.1659,0.7029,3.427,1.4661,0.1823,0.3768,3.0471,4.1295,5.5799,3.5185,0.9467,1.5762,3.9105,5.1396,1.7753,1.1548,3.8954,1.8571,5.4306,5.4506,3.3807,3.6784,0.4846,1.5182,1.7879,5.1368,5.5554,1.2739,2.1911,5.1365,1.0847,3.3803,2.0187,2.0517,3.0381,2.041,3.7403,5.1387,3.2075,1.831,6.1846,0.399,3.3168,0.9299,4.5664,1.394,0.0076,4.7575,1.0953,1.6988,0.2651,4.4836,4.0805,0.8285,3.0042,5.9881,2.012,4.3191,2.2904,1.0993,3.7703,2.3359,1.4043,5.8775,2.3365,0.7849,1.4716,1.3953,5.0592,1.0799,0.5471,0.0072,1.7865,0.005,3.6718,0.7819,1.7101,1.8625,0.2047,0.9211,5.4858,5.432,2.5931,5.616,5.4371,5.0824,6.0673,3.4267,4.7278,1.7463,1.7862,3.7017,0.5171,2.4517,2.4363,3.1808,6.764,6.2006,1.2928,2.2259,3.3379,1.6308,0.4013,0.2081,1.8798,2.6834,0.3604,0.7427,5.605,1.4231,2.7655,3.3986,2.8065,5.2734,0.1458,0.0002,5.0557,0.0317,2.7673,1.2753,2.5979,3.03,4.4612,0.3639,1.4819,2.7283,1.9353,0.1137,7.5061,1.3977,2.3552,1.4382,3.3644,2.427,5.901,0.9129,0.733,1.7827,4.8289,1.6104,0.8834,2.4264,0.854,2.8234,0.3199,0.3988,0.062,1.3997,0.6185,0.6157,0.038,1.1458,4.1147,0.1269,2.0995,2.5859,2.8411,1.6193,1.1788]}

{"id":1834,"ended":true,"length":444,"gen_text":"Piazzi originally suggested the name < unk > Ferdinandea for his discovery, after the goddess Ceres ( Roman goddess of agriculture, < unk > in Italian, who was believed to have originated in ancient Egypt ). His idea inspired others to look for natural resources elsewhere.\n\nPiazzi's idea was quickly accepted by the scientific community and has provided new details to the story of the < unk > fossils. In the early years after his discovery, Piazzi and his supporters argued that the fossil had not yet fully fused and that what he had found were fragmentary fossils. However, others such as the Smithsonian Institution, the British Museum, and the British Geological Survey believed that the fossil clearly represents fused vertebrae. Several early hypotheses sought to explain the fossil with a simple mechanism, such as an animal that died by falling from a tree. However, Piazzi's original hypothesis and other evidence have led many scientists to consider that Piazzi's found the fossils, and the new findings give them strength. Piazzi's find has created an international sensation, prompting many news stories about his find. People have also come to recognize that the fossils in this cave are really from a species that lived over 120 million years ago\u2014an age of the universe that is often measured in billions of years.\n\nIn the fall of 2012, the < unk > Fossil Site was opened to the public under the supervision of Piazzi, with an international group of scientists and researchers from universities worldwide. On June 7 of that year, Piazzi was featured on The Late Show with David Letterman, discussing the findings with Stephen Colbert and Conan O'Brien, and on May 9 the fossils were described in Nature magazine, by David Polly of the Smithsonian Institution. In 2013, in collaboration with the British Museum, Piazzi's team published a book in the journal Science on the fossil.\n\nIn March 2015, the < unk > Fossil Site celebrated its 100th birthday, and a national day of celebration was set out in conjunction with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. The site was used at the site of the international conference at which the results of the initial discovery were published, the 2015 meeting of North America's Paleontological Associations, and the 2015 meeting of the British Society for Earth Sciences and the Geological Society of London.","token_len":489,"entropy":[7.8766,4.4677,9.6498,5.301,1.7067,3.174,10.0736,12.2051,4.386,2.7565,16.1879,14.8033,2.1348,2.5829,6.609,1.1414,4.2978,0.6776,8.8703,9.4058,2.9881,9.079,1.1019,0.1414,0.593,2.0943,11.3098,1.0188,0.6298,0.1056,4.5429,3.2952,2.2256,6.3044,0.8886,3.9432,0.0405,1.2048,4.9257,0.6479,3.7458,1.9908,2.6639,4.215,4.5773,5.4611,4.5029,0.8075,3.5776,0.2217,6.5768,3.5349,5.5154,1.5348,1.6273,0.0508,2.677,0.0869,0.0588,1.4866,4.1694,1.1286,4.41,2.7916,0.6667,1.1136,1.9653,0.0374,1.9736,4.4566,6.2926,3.4801,5.9297,2.9981,1.3112,2.2761,0.085,0.9106,3.322,0.0669,0.0036,0.0119,4.8093,0.4549,3.0358,1.9226,2.1485,3.7579,3.2635,1.9122,0.5534,0.1407,1.1868,0.0081,0.0105,2.5594,0.6831,5.5744,2.9795,0.1539,0.6064,2.2802,3.4693,3.1467,3.5342,2.3857,3.3351,2.4982,1.3806,6.7522,2.7711,1.3837,0.7218,2.3986,4.5706,0.0103,1.7942,0.9459,2.1046,0.0385,5.497,4.5244,0.0048,3.5273,5.6785,0.4091,2.9445,1.8714,2.2482,0.1164,0.3999,0.3071,0.5704,3.7128,0.9802,0.0181,4.2297,0.4937,0.6057,1.2017,5.5744,5.5259,6.2214,2.1808,0.1014,0.0135,0.7939,5.9966,5.119,4.5765,5.8326,0.0301,0.2276,0.442,1.0622,5.0198,1.9603,4.614,2.9802,1.9392,0.9722,0.0036,2.6314,2.324,1.3114,3.0687,3.1736,2.8772,1.4543,0.3519,0.2808,1.1406,1.528,0.0205,2.8547,0.008,0.0068,1.2241,3.9968,1.1667,4.3103,3.318,3.0598,2.0511,1.4803,1.8714,0.9575,0.1239,3.4801,1.439,2.7623,0.0113,0.002,0.7486,6.1354,2.7205,2.4147,3.4685,1.6238,2.6457,4.9847,3.1501,5.5091,2.6725,5.9358,0.8608,3.4808,0.01,0.008,1.1242,4.078,1.4605,5.4409,2.5398,1.8257,2.877,1.2165,5.1249,2.1809,4.6064,1.4747,2.602,2.1634,1.4345,1.0478,6.8741,1.3429,2.7277,3.7899,0.5321,2.7349,2.0684,1.0786,1.6317,4.915,3.1833,5.4655,1.063,5.6245,3.4878,0.9921,2.7138,0.9699,1.754,3.5284,4.4246,0.0346,0.0048,0.0137,4.4778,2.9753,1.3471,3.7983,1.7167,3.7514,0.8383,1.3656,4.9578,6.0878,0.359,0.6688,0.0498,0.0062,0.2618,0.5404,0.0002,3.2468,1.9363,4.4332,0.027,3.5536,0.1114,1.5743,2.7272,0.0234,0.0013,0.0137,3.9476,0.1466,3.1838,0.5214,2.7682,0.2746,0.108,0.0313,5.4762,0.4169,2.9746,0.0124,3.5296,0.0444,0.0741,2.0017,3.2674,3.408,4.1722,2.5432,0.0269,0.9488,1.5657,3.8971,1.6355,4.3608,4.0608,0.8066,4.7441,2.9918,3.5636,5.1555,1.0582,0.0777,0.0541,1.8385,0.0112,0.0164,2.4537,5.37,0.8807,3.5352,2.1785,0.0329,0.16,0.0684,0.0,0.0002,1.2363,4.0353,0.9418,3.6609,2.4814,3.9577,0.0114,1.9438,4.908,0.0003,0.002,0.0052,2.5449,0.806,2.8689,2.976,3.5037,4.0661,2.6514,0.096,5.8379,0.2045,3.2248,1.6068,2.8962,3.3655,4.168,5.4661,0.7336,0.1756,1.638,0.1555,0.7496,2.35,2.491,0.2416,5.0167,1.8522,0.0029,0.6613,2.3306,0.4581,0.329,0.9664,0.0047,0.0089,2.5767,1.2428,1.4539,0.6645,2.2271,3.7261,1.6021,2.0212,2.8068,2.6596,0.3052,2.4047,1.3251,0.974,0.0002,2.4881,4.2093,1.5826,0.09,1.1862,1.6407,0.0098,0.0011,0.0081,0.0792,0.0006,0.0301,5.1318,0.1615,2.0983,0.0583,1.2705,1.3947,0.8634,3.0994,4.8252,3.2735,0.1001,0.3859,0.3777,6.2215,6.537,1.5702,5.3507,0.0124,0.3764,2.7921,1.3723,0.6228,0.4923,0.2803,0.0038,0.0008,1.6371,2.0779,0.8926,2.5311,0.4871,3.9129,0.0006,0.0002,0.0023,0.8757,0.4903,1.7185,1.524,1.2854,5.755,4.8239,0.8027,4.0498,2.3907,0.421,3.483,1.6946,4.6859,1.4221,0.81,3.4215,0.3263,0.4216,5.6135,2.3183,0.1423,2.3043,1.3581,3.2134,4.2899,2.064,0.1189,8.4628,1.7969,0.0592,1.3947,0.3504,0.0569,1.9834,0.0011,1.0842,0.4805,0.691,1.6881,0.4174,0.0119,0.0824,3.9712,1.9371,0.5505,3.1097,0.1502,3.9627,0.3562,1.4977,0.019,0.0586,0.22,0.228]}
{"id":397,"ended":false,"length":469,"gen_text":"In the UK, the album charted at number 20 on the Albums Chart. In the US, it peaked at number 24 on the Billboard Top Electronic Albums chart. In both cases, it spent one week in the top 20 of the US Billboard 200.\n\nThe songs were written and recorded by the Foo Fighters, although some of the instrumentals were performed by guitarist Dave Grohl, bassist Nate Mendel and drummer Taylor Hawkins. According to Grohl, after the band decided on the title, they considered including a second song, titled \"Everything Is Awesome\", but it didn't feel right for the tracklisting. The band discussed with drummer Taylor Hawkins how difficult it would be if their current lineup would need to change. Eventually, \"I knew with this one the way things were going to work,\" Grohl relates. \"You know, if things change I'll do it, if they won't do it I'll go. And that really is what happened. We weren't going to go change, so there was really nothing to do.\"\n\nWhile Grohl says some of the other songs on Foo Fighters' discography were not in any way influenced by the song on Songs for the Deaf, the band's guitarist notes that \"We had some other songs that had a lot of energy in them\" and the writing process for this song also \"was a great outlet for us\". \"We went in and had a really good time writing the songs, and we had a lot of fun,\" he adds. \"We got in a place where we knew what we wanted to do musically that day. What was kind of a different angle, and it just kind of came out that way, because we wrote it and then we recorded it and it was just so nice. It was a lot of fun at the time; we found the groove very quickly.\"\n\nThe Foo Fighters performed \"Everything is Awesome\" at the final show before their first headlining North American tour in support of the album. \"Everything Is Awesome\" was the closing song on Foo Fighters' first North American tour, their second in support of Songs for the Deaf, which had their own release in October 2001. The band has since expanded their live presence and became the first major rock act to perform at Coachella, in April 2004.

The ball found the backboard and the Lakers never saw it fall. It bounced to Steve Blake at the rim, hit him in stride, he got his left foot down and with a single arm, swished in the shot with 0.1 seconds left for the Sonics to a 3 point win.\n\nAftermath: Klay was traded to Utah where he suited up for one year before being dealt to Golden State for two first round draft picks, the best player in the draft, and two second rounders the following year. With the players the Clippers had on their roster for the 1977-78 season, the Sonics had a clear path to the 1979 NBA Finals. The Clippers were able to reach the finals and lost in six games to the Lakers before being defeated in the finals by the Boston Celtics. He was also a finalist for NBA Rookie of the Year.

{"id":4384,"ended":false,"length":444,"gen_text":"`` Pilot `` received mostly positive reviews from television critics. In a review from Zap2it, Rick Porter gave the pilot praise for bringing together the central theme, saying `` No other new science fiction show has captured the imagination of America's teenagers so completely. It has been like nothing seen before; all the things I expected to hate have turned out to be the things I love. I love everything about the show except the opening. It really is ridiculous. I feel like it's insulting to the intelligence. No other series is so blatant about this. It is so unlike science fiction that it has no right to be entertaining or have any redeeming value. In short, The 100 is one of the greatest shows on television today. It's genius is to completely take a completely disparate genre, and come up with something that feels completely unique. As a scientist, I can't say enough good things about the brilliant show. The producers and producers have managed to capture the spirit of what it feels like to be alive. As far as science fiction, I can't think of anything that has managed to do that. It takes the fantastical, and turns it into science. That is really something to feel for. The show's brilliance lies not just in its visuals, but in its intelligence. No program has been able to do that to me. I feel like this show lives up to all the predictions people make about what I love...The 100 is really just an incredible show. I couldn't be happier with what I've seen of it so far. At this rate, it won't be too many years before you begin to look at it in a different light.

{"id":4738,"ended":true,"length":392,"gen_text":"Starting on 1 May, the teams conducted a three @ - @ day test at the Mugello Circuit in Italy ahead of the Spanish Grand Prix. The test gave teams the opportunity to test the new 2017 cars in extreme conditions to assess their competitiveness. During the test, four cars completed 20 laps in all conditions on the circuit and recorded the maximum recorded lap time in each time slot: 0-1:05s, 1-1:22s, 1-1:42s and 1-1:51s, on each of 10 different occasions.\n\nThe FIA World Council has approved the following new technical regulations that have been approved by the Competition Committee:\n\nThe maximum speed limit has been raised from 200 km\/h to 220 km\/h with a 4m buffer zone in each direction between the limit and the circuit's limit, making the overall maximum speed the same as the current maximum of 220 km\/h. The maximum width of the front wing, the rear wing and the floor will change, with sidepod offset decreasing by 10\u00b0 to reduce drag at the high speeds during the corner exits.\n\nThe minimum downforce for 2017 has also been increased from 100kg\/h to 105kg\/h with the buffer zone changing from 2.5m to 3m.\n\nThe new 2017 cars' exhaust noise has also been reduced by 10dB from the 2016 cars, with the 2017 cars also being louder at low revs thanks to newly developed and revised tailpipes.\n\nThe maximum wind pressure has been increased from 1,350psi as in 2016 to 1,385psi, with this level having been reduced to 1,280psi for the high speed corners. The maximum speed has also been increased from 155km\/h to 165km\/h, but with an 8.5% buffer zone between the limit and the circuit's limit.\n\nIn March, the F1 Teams' Association (FOTA) released the preliminary list of the 2016 FIA WMSC Technical Regulations, confirming that the maximum speed had been reduced from 225km\/h to 220km\/h, sidepods would have a 10\u00b0 offset and the minimum downforce at high speeds has been reduced from 100kg\/h to 100kg\/h (with reduced sidespin area as part of the windward wing concept). The Fota release has also confirmed several of the 2017 technical regulations already published today.","token_len":492,"entropy":[2.9037,5.0499,3.3859,1.047,1.6061,8.0691,9.14,1.2883,3.9729,16.4,7.6805,8.5285,4.111,5.0903,2.723,0.9644,5.3613,6.7674,0.0253,1.9534,1.5212,0.4857,6.4794,0.0045,0.3019,5.241,0.2979,0.0031,0.4394,1.8661,2.5548,5.0694,2.1412,1.0396,0.5197,0.0096,1.6381,1.4448,1.3031,3.2896,3.5653,1.9737,5.2995,0.3075,3.8949,2.8383,1.3808,4.6374,1.5957,4.7837,0.1896,0.8066,0.4275,5.0537,2.0563,2.9489,4.9196,0.1761,2.0594,3.6392,0.6101,4.1706,0.9653,2.3097,2.6782,4.8545,1.6622,4.0909,5.0867,1.8642,0.5276,2.6338,0.9144,5.9682,2.1891,3.9528,3.1418,2.3135,1.4809,2.4393,3.9236,4.8451,0.765,0.1671,1.0753,0.0944,0.0077,4.5651,0.0341,0.0253,0.0699,0.6004,0.1825,0.0029,3.5552,0.007,0.358,0.1625,0.0686,0.2589,0.002,3.002,0.0084,3.8762,5.1336,3.1692,0.4052,6.0207,2.2957,2.9052,0.2197,0.8961,0.0017,1.3231,4.2642,1.8234,4.0883,3.073,1.7769,0.392,2.8096,4.5546,1.9031,0.1314,4.2816,3.0759,0.0839,1.3425,0.3846,0.1748,6.2371,0.7483,1.2666,0.1565,0.0003,2.537,1.733,2.5865,1.9881,2.3059,0.1245,2.5203,0.6558,3.1709,1.5957,0.0236,0.015,0.2416,2.3898,0.0694,0.0009,0.0009,4.5957,0.9039,6.0056,4.6217,3.8247,1.283,2.0406,2.9486,0.1225,2.5723,0.6654,1.5718,0.0495,0.1878,4.885,1.9442,3.189,2.9021,5.4666,0.8775,4.2347,2.1571,0.2518,4.373,0.315,0.1603,1.4118,3.325,1.6254,1.5495,1.6293,0.2196,0.0014,0.001,0.3655,1.7224,1.3449,5.2139,0.2309,0.2061,3.4911,0.6683,3.531,2.3035,1.943,0.0684,0.2205,0.1871,2.8143,2.963,5.0114,2.9585,1.586,6.5618,0.9021,4.8487,5.1132,1.7678,3.1315,4.1722,2.8801,4.1143,1.653,3.1649,1.5786,4.234,1.3224,5.2648,1.6974,2.0136,5.2353,0.2754,1.207,0.0003,0.7941,2.0154,2.9029,0.0032,4.1797,2.3811,0.9104,3.5111,0.1488,0.7827,1.3133,4.1364,0.6819,0.7645,2.4983,0.1846,1.8476,0.0264,0.0027,0.0015,2.647,1.5844,4.7362,0.1104,6.0562,0.6801,2.4566,1.2131,0.6998,0.2591,0.2811,1.2457,0.5809,0.6692,0.7312,0.0003,0.7508,3.6046,2.3221,1.7776,4.4987,4.3402,5.2205,1.1902,1.501,0.1061,1.805,1.3965,2.4251,0.6671,3.6671,1.1265,1.156,0.372,1.5474,1.5926,0.5271,2.5407,0.4257,1.5203,1.9632,3.298,1.689,1.3383,1.6042,0.0225,5.0704,0.0183,7.0608,0.83,4.6091,2.9285,5.7379,0.158,0.0008,0.4257,0.3116,0.0003,0.9319,2.6395,5.7395,3.6951,1.9243,0.6058,1.0172,0.3821,3.316,0.5743,4.5255,1.9339,0.0083,8.0702,1.306,0.1799,0.0383,0.0361,0.0015,4.8031,0.0113,0.0004,1.5498,1.1861,3.762,4.8002,4.2363,0.5717,3.6705,1.2087,0.2316,0.0023,4.7487,0.0111,0.0003,1.2135,1.1861,4.4945,0.5182,0.4958,0.6867,1.7499,1.3217,2.078,2.4513,0.5032,0.1633,0.6893,0.5731,4.9266,0.7711,0.0283,0.0023,0.0733,2.0959,0.0655,0.0007,0.0009,1.7751,3.4012,2.0259,3.2358,2.9055,3.2449,0.5118,2.2869,1.0286,0.1285,1.3358,0.1587,0.2825,0.0221,0.0882,0.5081,0.1497,0.0171,0.6536,0.3407,0.0002,3.7105,6.4858,0.6451,0.5704,3.9906,0.0764,2.1565,0.6058,0.7399,0.9378,0.001,0.3606,0.1469,3.2794,1.5574,5.161,3.0428,0.0144,1.4985,4.0132,5.3073,3.379,1.4195,0.0043,1.3033,0.0577,1.469,5.2288,1.1608,0.5162,2.275,2.427,3.6003,0.3043,2.3444,0.5463,2.8921,0.3616,0.0078,0.0011,0.1005,1.7713,0.0913,0.001,0.0012,1.5582,6.3398,1.2248,0.0052,1.7373,1.9153,1.6706,1.6962,0.379,0.0663,1.0455,0.6264,2.0353,0.3523,0.0021,3.9791,1.2837,1.3845,4.0332,0.2513,1.2666,0.405,0.8656,0.014,0.091,0.0083,0.019,2.9639,0.0034,0.0085,0.0124,4.4323,1.7791,7.2162,4.7989,1.875,5.4364,4.8062,3.8095,0.0018,0.5686,5.1018,7.066,3.467,3.8922,0.3644,2.2185,3.7765,4.5704,3.8255,4.8416,1.0795,0.3381,7.0143,2.5325,0.0268,3.1294,1.5441,0.1617,4.5321,1.9743,4.8857,0.925]}
{"id":3587,"ended":true,"length":440,"gen_text":"Forests cover about 57 % of the Potlatch River watershed, while about 38 % is used for agriculture and ranching. 78 % of the land is privately owned while 14 % lie within the U.S. Forest Service allotment.\nIt is interesting to note how these numbers have changed with the advent of modern technology, although we will not actually see that in our time line as far as farming goes. In 1850, only 1.8 % of the total forest area was privately held. This had declined to only 0.6 % in 1850 where it remained at that level until 1980, when the number finally began to rise back up to 9.7 % of total forest acreage. This is largely due to the increased use of forestry since 1950.\nBy 1900, the privately held forest area had increased to 13.7 % with a steady increase ever since. Although the average privately held forest was nearly 6 times larger than the average U.S. Forest Service allotment, the average privately held forest encompassed just 0.1 % of the total available area. This trend continued until 1950 with the private forest owning less than 0.08% of the total remaining forest. In 1985, roughly 50 % of the privately owned forest area had been claimed and by 2000, there were only 2.65 % privately owned forest land.\nIt is important to also point out that the U.S. Forest Service is the only federal agency that owns more than 40% of the total forest area, with the Department of the Interior owning over 33%.\nAlthough private ownership of U.S. forest land is relatively high, it is often used for various industrial uses such as forestry, ranches, timber, grazing, and logging. This can cause a lot of pollution on our planet, as noted above, but also contributes to the ever-growing amount of greenhouse gasses which in turn contributes to global warming.\nU.S. Forest Service Lands in Northern California\nThese figures were for the year 2016. They were extrapolated from the same statistics used for the Northern California data set.\u00a0\nThese are just a few of the many statistics I've amassed over the last thirty years of searching the internet to determine exactly how much land is owned by the U.S. Forest Service. I'll also do an update on my forestland holdings page in the near future.

In 2010, the airline acquired the's aircraft in a controversial $ 22 \/ share deal. The aircraft has been in use since 2001 and is equipped with a 5+ hour battery life.\nAn interesting article about the Dash 8 may be found here.\nThere has been much talk about the's's performance and its potential as a high performance aircraft in the past few years, and this is partly because of the interest shown by the United States Air Force ( USAF ), which was looking for an airframe with more capabilities and speed. The Dash 8 would have made for an excellent platform to develop such a plane, but unfortunately, that's not what has happened. The USAF found fault with the engine and a lack of avionics in the plane. The aircraft received several modifications during its use during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, but these have had very little effect on its overall performance. By the time it was retired, its performance had fallen from 9,600 lbs. to 2,800 lbs.\nThe Dash 8 is on ebay for some $ 30,000. There are similar aircraft for sale on Kijiji (Canada) where they are going for even less.\nThe Dash 8 also made its way into the hands of the US Marines, as a light's helicopter. The Marines have been using the aircraft for some decades, and there is some interest in buying two more. They could be equipped as attack, transport or surveillance helicopters.\nThis is the same Dash 8-101, which is used as an auxiliary transport in France - note the \"C.\" The light aircraft is still on ebay, for some $ 25,000.\nThere is a little more history in the below video.\nThe dash 8 could have performed very well in any aircraft class. It has a great reputation for reliability, speed and performance. However, what it lacks is the ability to sustain itself in the air longer than it was designed to, while retaining that performance. The Dash 8 is a unique aircraft, which was intended to use an un-pressurized airplane with less fuel and power than its predecessors. The result was reduced overall weight and a longer service life. But the Dash 8 was never able to achieve both those goals, and so now its time has come to join a new age.","token_len":493,"entropy":[10.5498,2.7813,0.0615,6.6535,0.5929,10.9864,11.3108,3.4828,4.712,3.5138,1.7843,7.6674,0.4994,6.8108,2.3591,1.5263,5.3279,1.7263,2.0093,1.797,11.5699,13.5794,6.6358,9.8243,6.9579,3.1164,2.5574,4.7412,7.5659,1.4369,0.7583,4.1087,5.2435,0.4329,1.0974,2.8245,4.5094,1.3143,10.69,3.1133,3.8931,1.3303,5.5136,1.0408,11.8338,6.0744,2.0758,0.643,0.8884,1.5669,2.3922,2.0529,1.3565,2.4768,2.7424,1.3708,4.2019,1.5137,1.4085,2.9142,0.0775,1.8719,5.1063,5.77,4.8561,3.2717,0.363,1.1017,2.1942,10.3923,4.3341,4.6454,1.8823,0.3296,2.303,0.0743,5.8568,0.0428,0.1694,0.751,2.3081,0.7274,5.2342,3.096,0.1789,2.3369,2.4784,0.7437,0.4753,8.4113,8.2459,4.1368,1.6845,2.535,3.6179,2.3278,0.406,3.5072,1.5971,1.4837,4.015,0.78,1.4284,1.5092,0.2204,1.819,1.9479,3.3357,1.6259,4.386,2.0385,0.8937,0.7666,6.664,2.2105,0.3422,1.2499,5.1579,0.3122,1.4708,0.0283,1.8921,3.2702,1.9938,1.3514,3.3197,2.3459,0.4368,1.4788,4.3585,2.4552,2.1514,3.608,5.0398,2.1683,5.018,1.7131,1.5739,1.3622,0.03,5.3864,1.2507,3.7443,3.2021,1.0697,1.0479,2.9037,2.6696,3.6136,1.7238,0.9035,2.419,1.0272,1.507,2.973,1.3075,3.9205,3.5919,0.56,0.8165,3.6016,0.1332,0.1783,1.7903,0.9328,5.7523,7.0716,0.0386,0.2791,4.3767,1.5731,4.3591,3.4877,0.006,4.6024,0.0076,2.8447,0.2748,2.9497,1.4681,1.6376,3.4659,5.7576,4.0383,1.5137,3.8952,0.7314,4.6154,5.5224,0.4232,2.7183,2.0951,0.1106,0.6027,0.4005,0.553,2.7316,2.7384,3.9302,3.8158,0.2458,0.6277,0.1876,0.6776,3.2102,0.1215,0.3489,5.9789,0.9927,0.377,1.4754,0.6393,0.7504,1.3634,3.6374,1.5149,1.1512,2.5893,3.8646,5.3889,1.3136,3.2706,3.541,0.8875,0.6921,5.1768,0.0065,2.4812,0.1074,0.2667,2.401,1.3652,0.8805,0.0255,1.709,5.0086,6.8718,2.1759,1.1808,5.7601,0.3385,4.4547,0.4405,0.1057,1.0608,3.9976,1.1623,5.6619,1.1241,2.4991,0.3178,0.8743,6.064,0.0989,0.0094,3.5398,3.5786,0.4837,5.8872,1.8136,1.4425,2.5659,0.0196,5.3087,0.5741,0.4214,1.1957,1.6313,0.8102,0.0343,5.193,2.498,2.8277,0.9726,0.7314,0.4144,1.146,0.0044,1.1008,2.932,2.7948,1.4341,3.3032,1.9801,3.5787,10.996,4.2222,0.7443,1.3598,1.6832,2.4482,1.8849,0.9057,0.6851,1.4273,1.3115,1.9313,6.7916,0.8476,1.1148,4.0183,1.4821,2.8276,3.4289,0.3955,3.5533,5.5356,0.4503,1.5281,3.8166,3.8158,1.444,4.0151,4.7167,3.651,3.9627,1.9107,1.3435,3.7205,1.2221,0.542,0.9164,3.8419,1.2002,1.442,3.7161,2.0829,0.0336,5.7674,5.9706,2.6194,1.6095,1.7833,3.1035,2.7897,1.7794,4.079,2.3679,2.5549,5.4792,5.8334,4.8205,0.3049,3.6493,3.8348,5.5271,2.5689,5.5931,2.8406,1.1675,3.5533,4.5539,0.842,0.0213,2.2827,2.4181,1.2795,0.0586,3.337,0.0451,0.0703,0.2595,0.6131,3.2616,0.9912,1.3885,5.3228,1.7063,3.0467,3.9537,0.6797,5.5444,1.3735,1.5497,0.9661,1.4512,4.7318,0.3111,5.253,0.9968,4.4362,2.2758,0.0403,1.2215,4.5529,4.2433,2.127,1.5048,1.3176,2.0654,1.1161,3.0518,5.1579,0.9453,1.9973,0.9499,3.1918,0.5103,2.5477,0.6713,1.9275,0.0231,4.9567,1.5291,1.6481,1.2288,1.8228,2.1976,0.0337,5.173,2.4236,1.0477,1.1791,0.8496,5.49,0.1544,2.6486,3.3338,0.2015,0.5397,2.0715,4.309,4.8202,4.4159,2.5264,0.3371,2.0671,1.2222,0.0443,1.5349,1.5633,4.3672,0.2767,0.8976,2.8401,2.7264,3.8183,0.3192,5.7021,3.7977,4.459,2.9224,1.8179,0.097,4.278,3.0883,4.7644,1.8182,2.1494,4.9056,0.739,3.1727,2.4495,0.4164,1.8931,3.3114,0.8234,7.3287,4.9485,1.0474,0.907,2.2679,3.7095,3.6164,0.0456,0.3623,4.1118,1.562,1.5982,0.051,1.9118,1.6791,2.669,0.0041,1.6912,5.0909,4.0256,0.4317,1.4101,0.4879,3.7777,4.3286,3.3097,2.194,1.0459,0.3538,0.1969,6.2878,3.8739,1.9516,4.3237,1.3868]}

A ship reported a gale and a pressure of 1 @, @ 006 mbar ( 29 @. @ 005 hPa ), which is below the level of natural oscillation. As of June 27, a possible tropical cyclone was located about 1030 km south southwest of the Galapagos Islands.\n\nas of June 27. The maximum vertical wind shear is currently 5.1 m\/s; a slight weakening of the surface wind shear over the next few days should allow for a minor increase in the maximum wind speed. Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph with the smallest gusts near 60 mph. The hurricane is expected to weaken as it strengthens.\n\nSoutheast of Cape Town, South Africa, a tropical cyclone was located about 700 km west of Cape Town on June 20.\n\n. A tropical storm or tropical cyclone is about to become a hurricane in the western Atlantic Ocean on June 30, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph.\n\nThe most recent hurricane update (June 21, 2018), updated by the NHC, shows the central pressure in the eastern tropical Atlantic is 986 mb. At 982 mb the tropical cyclone is located nearly directly over the area where the storm is expected to form on June 20. The NHC expects this region of the Atlantic Ocean will see the beginnings of a developing hurricane by next Tuesday. At 986 mb, the central pressure, and consequently the pressure differential between the NHC model and the European model for the western tropical Atlantic at the beginning of the central pressure drop, are almost identical. I am confident that if this is the case, the final track and intensity of the system will also be similar.\n\nWhile I am confident that the eastern tropical Atlantic hurricane season will be good, it is possible that this season will be less active than others. The Atlantic basin currently includes some of the weakest hurricanes on record. The recent record of two hurricanes forming in June (which was a weak storm) was broken only in 2011, by one storm. There is no doubt we will have good activity though, and the year should be another good one.","token_len":494,"entropy":[8.3631,11.8566,1.1534,0.0027,3.8007,3.6812,2.5651,0.3137,0.8058,0.0487,3.2745,2.2937,4.873,3.6321,1.1195,3.5889,8.9189,5.6819,1.5275,7.1013,0.0383,3.5914,2.3615,8.1168,1.7689,4.8103,15.3145,7.0196,8.2837,9.217,5.433,1.528,3.1926,2.7598,10.4918,11.4534,4.3396,7.5562,1.8896,1.8728,3.1704,0.0009,3.6645,2.4284,0.7729,3.7501,0.3323,5.3154,0.5919,5.5893,4.2398,0.5071,0.8484,1.5645,0.0092,3.2096,1.678,1.9201,1.1427,2.361,0.0468,0.0292,0.0033,0.0001,0.0015,0.0039,0.0012,0.0022,0.0315,0.0128,0.0496,0.004,0.0244,0.0045,0.0042,0.0021,0.0081,0.127,0.0026,0.0024,0.0092,0.0003,0.0007,0.0016,0.0003,0.0306,0.0024,0.0009,0.0021,0.0011,0.0003,0.0012,0.0002,0.0,0.0001,0.0017,6.4087,0.2266,0.5201,1.5825,0.2468,2.7841,2.9522,0.1592,0.0632,0.0003,0.3617,0.0474,3.741,4.6406,4.5595,0.785,2.4922,4.6103,0.0485,2.0864,3.0075,0.2597,0.0037,0.1809,0.6105,1.0039,0.0002,5.8115,0.0015,0.006,0.0013,1.8922,4.8119,4.8132,6.0663,0.1152,0.611,0.0033,2.8694,3.8494,4.2007,2.2165,2.9327,0.4673,0.2738,0.0429,5.763,3.2239,4.1724,2.8678,1.2556,0.2657,4.9472,1.4396,0.5674,0.0021,4.1275,0.115,0.6716,1.8898,0.0274,1.8143,1.8378,1.6387,1.1727,4.3725,2.3096,0.1453,0.6614,3.0241,1.6518,1.0383,0.5958,4.3738,0.7645,0.5184,0.9711,0.9343,4.2478,2.7058,1.4473,4.4432,5.6507,1.324,0.1845,0.8856,1.7418,0.0127,0.1935,1.8354,4.0312,1.7668,1.9759,0.0052,2.8219,2.3893,0.088,6.7443,1.014,0.5586,0.0002,5.1222,3.274,1.3894,4.5254,2.4986,0.2404,0.248,0.003,0.5521,1.483,1.575,1.6095,0.0008,1.6411,0.4192,2.7803,4.7124,0.177,2.3522,0.6538,0.5952,0.2858,1.1648,0.141,4.2711,0.2428,1.737,0.0002,9.1553,3.4564,0.5799,2.6624,2.7751,1.4234,1.9767,0.0006,1.0843,4.97,0.7891,1.7929,0.1857,0.2347,2.3426,0.1948,2.5492,0.5059,1.077,5.1716,0.5168,4.9926,1.7306,3.2144,1.8023,0.0294,0.0133,1.1243,2.8625,0.0744,0.8796,1.3608,0.0003,2.1606,4.4331,1.4306,3.0962,4.8492,4.2668,1.0989,3.1223,1.5464,0.9224,3.6972,3.3199,2.7705,0.7098,2.0608,0.0034,0.9249,1.8908,1.5672,4.0809,0.662,2.6688,0.1249,2.1232,1.8545,0.0897,2.2043,1.3015,4.0596,0.0984,0.0023,1.1849,4.9318,3.4093,4.0332,0.0817,0.0186,2.3181,3.6087,0.516,0.0038,0.4927,1.6753,5.6072,4.1329,0.5732,0.3947,4.5743,2.2176,1.4535,3.9835,1.6238,1.0299,0.0129,2.8855,2.0123,0.6617,3.2282,0.4734,1.3101,1.25,0.001,2.076,2.7363,3.6622,1.8445,0.1446,0.4276,1.337,3.8669,2.3794,1.5017,6.0057,0.006,1.8327,3.6116,1.5499,2.611,4.4725,1.7742,0.9865,4.3303,0.6674,2.9834,0.0246,0.0044,1.1235,0.2452,1.4461,0.0053,4.2377,3.4614,4.5894,0.5299,1.9069,4.0253,1.2,0.1813,5.135,0.0028,3.1188,0.2699,0.3241,2.0806,0.2674,3.5636,0.5586,3.9722,1.8508,0.0087,5.105,1.1763,3.0176,0.0086,0.4656,4.3378,0.5154,2.0106,0.9009,2.6935,4.8507,1.0268,0.4558,6.6019,3.1286,3.6333,0.7169,4.4159,2.0373,2.4592,0.8969,0.2913,0.4977,0.7275,6.3595,4.121,1.4601,0.2049,0.938,0.4068,3.0068,0.2605,3.7465,0.3295,1.5565,0.577,0.9219,0.0003,5.4774,2.8454,1.4273,1.3457,0.6193,0.6723,4.637,0.401,0.0206,3.9254,0.5129,0.5976,1.24,4.5682,0.7201,2.2776,0.5228,2.9188,0.3098,2.7467,1.1212,0.7796,0.7625,2.3026,0.6041,0.1812,3.8924,0.872,1.7341,3.9851,2.207,4.139,5.2887,3.7469,0.4195,0.0109,3.6728,1.1668,1.388,0.0404,0.9206,1.757,4.7353,3.2087,2.3742,4.3398,1.4984,1.8158,0.4677,3.2413,2.2395,5.7508,2.0437,2.7095,3.419,2.5512,0.4508,2.0145,1.7171,2.249,1.4667,3.5062,1.6562,4.3797,2.6783,1.7383,1.0686,3.416,1.6496,2.3893,1.7056,4.8439,0.6588,1.1027,4.8398,1.1186,5.8571,0.9164,1.5065,2.1857,5.3934,2.6037,0.8133,3.918,2.2366,0.1469,0.4642]}
{"id":3459,"ended":true,"length":442,"gen_text":"In addition to Beilein being a coach for the World University Games, the Big Ten was represented at the games by Yogi Ferrell, Will < unk >, Aaron White and Adreian Payne.\n\nBeilein is coming off of a first-year season at Michigan State where he guided the second-ranked Spartans to an 11-12 season, the toughest in the Big Ten. With the departure of Michigan's Mark Dantonio and the departure of Michigan's all time leading scorer and player in DeShaun Thomas, the Michigan State program has struggled under Beilein. Beilein is the 8th head coach in school history, and with two of the school's four coaches coming off their second year at Michigan State, it has to feel great to see Beilein on hand alongside his fellow Big Ten coaches. Michigan State's recruiting class is coming together nicely with the group having signed 11 players out of the state of Michigan, which included four-stars from the state and the most local recruits recruited out of the state in the last seven years.\n\nWhile Beilein has his problems at Michigan State, there is no question that he is turning the program around. Despite losing two-thirds of his starting point guard from last season, Beilein showed signs of improvement in his first season at the helm of the Spartans. When asked by The Detroit News (via @JReedStar) if he had a \"magic recipe\" for Michigan State, Beilein had a very honest answer. \"I don't think you've got to put a lot of ingredients in any one recipe -- that's just not how it happens.\"\"There's no formula for that, no matter who you put in the position, no matter what the criteria is for success you're looking for. It's about how do you develop the players that can then support their teammates?\"\n\nThis season Beilein will be able to put an extremely deep collection of talent on the floor under his direction, and with the amount of talent the Wolverines have, it should be an excellent season. Beilein may not be an extremely prolific recruiter like Dantonio, nor will Beilein command the kind of buzz Dantonio brings with his coaching, but the Wolverines will have plenty of talent to work with, and a coach who is known as one of the hottest young coaches in the country will give them a real shot at success.","token_len":496,"entropy":[2.8552,0.5121,9.5209,5.3222,0.1165,5.3981,1.8103,4.2911,3.5411,0.7165,6.5734,3.6084,0.0272,0.7103,2.5517,5.8479,0.3572,4.626,3.3755,2.0307,0.2652,2.6966,1.2732,8.4803,0.0004,0.0035,0.0015,0.498,7.4188,15.1412,11.6937,2.5399,0.7546,7.2204,5.8241,4.7339,1.741,6.1496,0.6422,0.0013,0.0012,0.3453,0.9452,0.0025,3.687,0.002,0.001,3.0299,4.9396,0.0824,1.915,0.4992,4.7549,0.619,2.8213,0.9462,1.6807,0.9595,1.845,1.4989,0.5924,2.0428,0.0907,6.8406,0.0759,0.4133,0.115,0.0524,2.1552,0.8523,0.037,5.9959,4.5134,2.0231,2.7497,6.4051,1.3223,1.4143,0.584,0.0087,0.7917,4.3462,1.3945,3.195,0.0094,4.4393,0.9141,4.5232,0.014,0.0003,0.0,1.3984,0.8559,2.1723,0.0296,2.5299,1.9901,5.3445,5.2018,0.6342,0.29,2.2406,5.3543,0.7901,4.8841,2.1308,0.6726,0.1331,0.3878,1.9625,4.4937,0.0362,1.2211,2.0182,3.7914,3.9995,0.3212,0.0003,0.0016,0.8336,2.6406,0.001,0.003,2.5825,3.2149,6.3175,0.0691,1.8678,0.0364,0.3505,2.438,0.0051,1.6405,1.0557,4.7734,4.2565,2.7437,0.9334,4.941,0.0137,3.3947,4.5046,2.9164,0.6776,5.6352,1.6029,1.0749,1.5769,1.5527,0.2742,0.199,1.5828,3.3223,2.8663,3.4215,3.4974,0.722,3.1121,1.1666,0.0003,0.0016,4.306,7.8834,6.1582,1.5599,2.9713,1.4307,0.0181,0.3645,0.4627,5.5977,0.2785,2.6534,4.7673,0.6397,1.6217,3.3911,1.5752,1.7408,2.3934,1.5223,5.7516,3.6665,3.5668,3.8831,1.8819,4.1122,0.0096,0.8352,1.6682,0.1293,0.2477,1.6774,2.3518,5.246,2.4847,2.3169,3.1665,3.5204,1.4051,0.6645,5.4127,2.697,4.9115,6.0318,2.7054,6.8125,2.6211,0.0135,0.685,0.5145,1.0256,1.159,1.3304,3.9234,0.1339,0.2117,0.7495,0.0003,4.239,1.5068,0.0003,0.0017,2.2476,3.9976,5.9862,1.7553,0.1075,0.081,0.13,3.1912,0.7792,0.2826,1.6823,0.4192,0.5334,0.7188,5.6339,1.2262,0.364,0.0995,0.8704,5.1997,2.4808,2.9171,1.819,0.8416,0.0076,1.5155,1.628,4.3816,0.4365,2.4081,0.4607,0.5525,0.3451,0.7397,0.0002,0.0007,5.9128,3.5683,0.1577,1.6628,1.893,0.713,0.7003,0.7449,1.3419,1.9537,0.0375,1.7908,0.2177,0.8075,0.3089,5.6622,3.2739,3.5231,3.6218,2.2364,0.1103,6.904,0.6703,5.8687,7.4305,7.848,6.7441,0.4374,1.2365,0.5413,2.8966,1.6551,3.955,4.7596,5.6993,0.1054,0.4392,2.492,0.0261,1.2509,0.0671,0.0002,0.0005,3.245,1.7412,2.6694,2.6395,0.6627,0.5892,1.5379,1.234,0.6619,0.001,1.9285,2.955,4.6208,0.4663,0.8754,4.636,1.0302,2.1968,0.123,1.6466,1.212,5.5619,1.2036,1.5327,6.9441,3.5007,0.3473,2.3446,1.3313,0.916,0.6244,4.1499,7.5382,4.4179,0.7033,1.2257,2.9301,1.8834,2.6583,2.0971,3.8283,1.4712,1.6845,0.7697,2.3517,0.3455,1.9837,2.8988,2.3126,2.3529,0.0084,0.7413,2.7904,5.7314,0.4457,2.6223,3.2302,5.5131,1.7547,1.3943,0.1516,1.3416,1.8645,0.4095,2.0894,2.6697,2.0622,0.2435,3.7087,1.6351,1.9916,2.2818,3.5834,3.5599,5.2948,4.1852,1.0134,2.502,0.9277,0.0002,4.126,1.706,2.527,0.0003,0.0005,1.27,1.4122,3.8503,0.0068,3.0836,4.2091,5.5419,4.973,5.9959,0.0039,0.6027,0.5632,0.0762,0.4248,4.1682,0.218,2.0869,1.3795,1.2505,2.0354,1.192,4.8436,0.0134,1.0342,2.56,2.0115,0.0001,0.5748,2.9024,1.5711,2.3212,0.572,1.4488,3.5322,0.5356,0.929,2.0387,0.0011,0.0008,4.2943,0.7652,0.8305,4.2401,5.1879,5.2718,1.5152,0.0001,2.906,0.6845,0.0005,0.0008,0.6631,4.9457,1.7203,2.4732,0.0003,0.0004,6.7881,0.6324,3.3783,0.003,5.1369,2.4461,0.0009,0.0009,4.5852,2.2803,0.6197,3.733,1.4945,0.025,2.2045,2.2643,0.0001,1.8259,1.9534,3.1249,0.0969,0.9167,0.9689,1.2264,0.0107,2.1908,0.2851,3.7785,2.7354,1.512,1.6145,3.6744,2.5615,2.9803,0.1706,0.0401,7.3234,3.0615,0.4427,0.0942,0.3209,0.3831,2.2869,4.3673,1.811,1.1911,4.6822,1.0034,0.4534,2.9153,0.3886]}
{"id":418,"ended":true,"length":466,"gen_text":"During the last glacial period, and up until about 9000 years ago, most of Ireland was covered with ice, most of the time. Sea levels were lower and Ireland, like Iceland and North America, was a relatively cool place. But between the last glacial period and the beginning of the Holocene about 13,000 years ago, sea levels rose in Ireland, not because of any major change in land elevation, but because of changes in the ocean currents. During these higher seas the ocean currents drove up the level of the Irish Atlantic ocean where currents flow towards the UK, leaving North America and Europe much lower than the level we see today. In Ireland, these higher seas also pushed up the level of coastal ground between the coastlines of Ireland and Europe with a consequent change of vegetation and vegetation cover. During the Holocene long ago, more Irish land was exposed, and with it more sea level. But, because of its higher sea levels during the Holocene era, Ireland became much warmer than it is today and there was a change in the climate.\n\nHowever, some of the vegetation found during the time period during which Ireland was covered with ice is still there today, for example the oak trees. These oak trees are mostly found in the countryside of Ireland and were mainly used for fuel, wood cutting, and for decorations in the houses and also for decoration on the ships.\n\nThe other areas which have had their vegetation gradually replaced by the sea are North America, Europe, Sweden, Norway, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria.\n\nWhen the ice age ended about 10 000 years ago, the sea levels were much like they will be today and Iceland and Ireland were the very high point of the Atlantic, and as a result Ireland was covered with thick continental snow, as in this photo of Iceland.\n\nAnd when the sea levels in the sea which was then covering Ireland started to fall, the area where the sea level fell was called the mid-ocean ridge, because it was over sea level. The mid-ocean ridge covered most of Ireland when it was last covered by ice, during the last glacial period.\n\nToday, Ireland is not over water level at all because the mid-ocean ridge did not disappear and was replaced with open ocean during the last glacial period, but instead was filled in with fresh water. This is why modern Ireland is very different from the environment that Ireland was millions of years ago.","token_len":496,"entropy":[0.8466,3.6852,8.7819,0.0525,1.0278,0.4761,6.0207,4.3272,0.7819,1.6541,6.8609,0.27,0.0542,0.1316,3.6842,0.6558,7.1924,0.3564,0.3295,1.797,2.6361,1.7616,5.6561,0.2464,1.0837,3.3349,1.1653,6.8668,0.3281,0.5023,2.6143,2.3718,3.9175,4.106,2.176,3.6536,1.2654,4.7547,0.0332,0.1755,0.6613,2.3453,2.9829,3.0772,0.927,0.4098,2.5405,4.0265,2.8554,0.7096,0.4591,0.0001,0.504,0.0915,0.3725,2.8048,0.0016,0.0639,1.5634,0.0006,3.0031,3.0923,0.0442,0.1244,0.0476,0.0045,0.114,1.0734,0.0637,0.4701,4.0578,0.5222,1.4684,6.0937,1.6119,0.3275,2.3971,3.1792,2.2661,0.0728,3.9391,1.1009,0.4336,0.0688,0.1971,0.3643,2.8976,0.0876,0.5456,2.1523,1.5252,0.5848,4.0136,3.2037,4.6334,1.8396,4.0114,3.5003,1.423,4.8083,2.9725,0.6214,1.487,0.0065,0.2065,2.8674,3.2584,4.1406,6.8672,5.6488,4.5712,3.7275,0.7081,3.4751,1.7398,5.6059,6.6258,0.9634,0.9714,1.6501,4.3986,1.6665,1.191,3.8833,1.6604,5.6625,0.8139,0.0988,0.0833,3.6756,2.4291,0.6069,3.6892,1.8258,0.263,3.0464,2.6563,0.4926,0.2504,0.591,0.0078,6.3529,5.5388,5.7346,1.0376,3.7332,1.5989,0.9312,0.6347,0.1553,4.0788,7.1757,2.6142,2.4749,0.0015,3.1762,2.9399,3.5886,1.5506,3.4513,0.2399,0.4071,4.2988,0.724,1.7527,0.0004,6.8531,3.5672,0.4481,6.0346,5.0271,1.2825,0.5312,1.143,2.3944,1.4765,4.1641,0.8401,1.5031,3.0284,1.1788,2.0609,3.1888,3.0731,2.4322,0.7913,4.7204,3.3332,0.6159,0.9793,4.1888,0.2834,0.8421,0.0003,6.7064,0.1454,0.3402,3.4086,2.0068,1.4573,1.2279,0.3468,0.2645,0.2151,2.4766,4.0618,0.4043,0.9875,3.157,0.2625,0.7522,1.961,0.8777,1.5508,0.0275,5.1288,0.0659,4.5851,1.505,0.434,3.3027,4.2624,3.4374,0.3355,3.9531,2.8304,3.7701,0.3411,0.6492,0.3679,1.412,1.0533,0.6036,1.4141,1.1691,1.9068,0.7703,1.4933,4.136,0.1406,1.5896,3.6374,1.3337,1.9776,2.367,1.9125,0.0262,1.235,4.8312,0.75,0.5749,0.9556,5.3954,1.884,0.3914,1.2807,3.7746,4.9843,1.0446,0.5458,1.1418,2.434,2.1886,7.55,1.4199,1.0886,1.9604,5.7367,2.6085,1.2347,3.5682,2.1742,5.83,1.2595,2.4572,1.8575,1.2546,3.804,1.1282,1.7158,0.0002,1.8021,5.0532,5.4768,2.7006,2.0523,4.5197,3.0185,0.6606,5.9807,1.5152,0.3698,2.8327,3.7386,1.2032,4.1661,1.4495,0.8579,2.3107,0.556,6.668,0.4441,1.8084,0.3799,2.8173,4.6442,0.0163,1.5156,4.5424,0.1539,1.4722,0.0002,4.7994,1.2161,2.1635,2.2123,0.2682,1.6929,1.3613,3.6454,0.0302,0.0083,0.3282,1.058,1.5141,1.3907,3.0714,1.9705,8.3125,0.3516,9.7535,0.0819,1.3803,2.9528,5.6487,1.9478,1.265,0.815,4.445,5.6561,3.339,2.4209,0.5339,0.3389,1.5935,4.0113,2.4631,4.7065,1.1264,0.265,2.6409,1.1274,2.6743,0.5201,4.2457,4.8853,4.6819,2.3519,3.5487,3.5669,3.5171,1.7679,2.6343,2.3544,1.2721,0.7913,0.0001,4.7915,2.7913,0.2372,1.9613,0.9432,4.2556,1.6976,5.7269,4.8748,3.4057,2.7369,2.8411,0.5755,2.4149,0.1343,1.5143,0.7895,1.2492,4.9377,3.4269,0.8823,2.0933,1.0435,2.589,0.6191,2.2797,0.5091,5.2449,0.269,1.6433,0.0002,0.0875,1.3142,2.1824,0.9332,0.6556,4.8061,4.774,0.6523,1.3323,2.0412,1.416,0.0123,0.0022,0.0001,0.0497,4.2404,1.7206,0.0129,1.2631,4.9172,0.9521,0.3741,5.6238,0.6091,0.4869,0.2368,1.4859,4.4426,0.101,0.2379,0.5261,0.0001,0.0551,0.6516,1.0604,0.0002,3.9564,0.5288,2.3515,0.4169,3.7898,3.4564,3.6822,1.625,4.687,0.2763,3.6155,0.716,1.8406,0.0073,0.0014,0.0,0.0262,6.2505,0.0253,1.3569,2.3535,4.4578,1.6533,2.7171,6.8081,1.1229,3.3868,0.0884,0.4636,0.8133,0.0002,0.0413,1.5751,1.2882,3.7946,3.3053,2.576,2.2032,1.3305,3.0255,0.247,1.2116,2.5978,1.1166,1.2588,6.569,0.7197,0.3366,3.3762,2.3938,0.4286,0.7811,5.5004,2.4051,2.4561,0.4238,5.4479,0.0254,0.0033,0.0041,0.4258]}

{"id":828,"ended":true,"length":483,"gen_text":"On 1 May 2007, No Smoke \u2013 The Shocking Truth About British Justice, by Sandra Lean, was published by Exposure Publishing. This book features the stories of seven high @ -level criminals who were in prison for heinous crimes they did not commit. The authors, who were in solitary confinement when writing their stories, were able to come to terms with the shocking nature of the cases as they gained insight into life behind bars.\nWith this book, Lean aims to remind people that when the law is not enforced, it is the law that has become a tool for the criminal to commit their crimes and for victims to be forgotten. The stories of these seven offenders were not of high profile cases. The main one was that of Charles Clarke, convicted of the murder of a police officer, Peter Blake, in 1987. Clarke had no prior convictions.\nWhile Clarke was in jail, his wife Julie, who was pregnant with her first child, was brutally brutalised by another inmate who later claimed he attacked Clarke after being beaten by another man in a prison cell.\nClarke tried to save his wife with a makeshift hammer, and he tried to stop the attack. His efforts were thwarted by another inmate and he was subsequently attacked a number of times.\nOther prisoners from Clarke's cell were responsible for torturing Julie in order to keep her silent and, by association, for keeping Clarke in solitary confinement. In 2003, five of them were put on trial. None of them were found guilty of the brutal attack on Julie.\nDespite this shocking crime, Clarke was put back into solitary as he had expressed remorse for it. He was also denied access to a lawyer and, despite his pleas, the judge decided that neither he nor Clarke's family would be allowed to attend his trial. When their request for this was refused, they decided to take a case to the European Court of Human Rights.\nIn a highly successful test case, the European court ruled that the blanket practice of putting criminals on trial in isolation (whether they were found guilty of the same crime or not) was 'inhuman and degrading'. These blanket solitary prisons, for which British prisons have been condemned as a result, have not been abolished.\nThere is absolutely no excuse for these types of prison punishments and any form of punishment should be decided solely on the actual facts of the case. The British government needs to start putting more resources into rehabilitation and prevention rather than just keeping people in prison for life sentences.","token_len":496,"entropy":[6.9948,3.043,4.5825,0.2919,8.7273,10.7107,6.0552,2.6017,6.7291,0.6438,0.8152,1.1473,5.8462,7.4525,1.9923,2.693,8.2292,9.0984,0.4749,0.7174,0.2346,1.4,13.6855,5.3052,0.485,3.2283,1.0839,5.7919,1.8994,4.3078,0.055,4.4061,5.6425,15.9589,7.46,1.6372,2.8299,1.0357,1.0782,5.1087,1.7829,1.4433,5.7695,0.2819,3.5047,1.1143,0.0202,0.0072,0.4876,1.7337,3.7779,2.8753,1.5203,2.1084,4.1043,6.7776,0.0382,3.8425,2.5965,1.8723,2.299,0.092,1.7733,2.9031,0.0136,5.027,0.4163,0.4263,0.029,1.536,4.822,3.1758,0.014,1.5491,4.153,4.81,0.8211,4.4234,1.6041,0.3705,4.4687,0.542,0.1623,0.3348,1.3852,10.3125,3.0674,0.7579,0.433,2.0266,4.7505,0.0288,5.8257,1.9292,0.9126,4.7261,2.4277,2.3555,0.8345,2.684,1.3293,0.4445,2.2672,0.7663,1.6285,2.9914,0.7904,3.4779,2.4493,1.7351,1.7867,1.3551,1.4726,3.1617,1.4472,3.2838,2.0855,0.2788,2.4217,3.8873,4.2053,0.3049,0.9771,2.2014,0.1921,2.5064,3.7133,1.4558,0.5425,1.0924,4.7152,3.2249,2.9575,5.045,5.0283,0.9254,1.6615,2.4966,2.7465,4.432,5.0186,1.2155,1.0257,0.0098,5.5964,3.6075,0.3666,3.3028,0.4031,1.1536,0.8946,0.0377,2.1404,3.1381,0.2418,1.7513,4.1095,5.3773,0.8568,0.8435,3.4713,0.2518,1.3599,2.4939,3.8371,1.3527,0.4461,1.9029,2.2652,5.403,2.6558,0.749,1.1246,2.4334,0.4923,2.0708,2.2128,5.8104,2.2705,1.21,0.9009,1.5382,0.7356,5.1306,1.8776,0.0599,0.1936,1.0467,3.2705,7.4811,0.1405,0.6831,1.731,0.6384,2.7395,4.2791,3.6064,1.2343,5.037,3.565,2.8657,1.7813,4.7222,0.7306,3.9901,4.1381,1.8712,1.9327,1.007,2.3492,0.299,1.3489,2.6405,0.0,6.3306,0.1242,4.4359,0.3652,0.106,4.3468,1.0945,3.3383,5.3699,1.4744,2.9192,2.9384,3.9316,0.1145,3.8683,0.4406,1.285,1.7709,4.117,2.0415,0.6083,3.1122,0.9054,1.3874,0.2419,3.063,1.2542,0.4066,3.6249,2.8252,4.1212,4.0802,0.0025,0.0625,0.8911,1.443,5.6138,3.139,5.632,1.1988,0.0054,0.3305,2.2256,3.753,0.0391,5.0433,0.0012,1.5346,3.0981,2.995,0.0166,3.3684,0.1435,3.142,2.3295,4.5946,4.3803,5.9169,0.0231,2.7147,1.8871,0.8645,0.9677,1.5302,0.0657,0.2399,3.2672,5.1692,0.1697,6.2049,1.6929,2.0807,0.2722,5.3638,0.2869,0.0638,2.0694,4.5814,0.3807,0.5905,0.446,0.9936,0.0133,1.6645,1.2166,3.8053,2.0209,0.4822,0.277,0.8919,0.556,4.3497,1.8772,4.3475,3.8284,0.4053,0.7822,0.5556,4.06,0.6239,1.142,0.8637,5.8845,1.1943,1.4317,6.0717,2.0864,0.7628,2.58,0.4559,1.925,0.7159,3.0065,4.6361,1.4298,0.0059,1.6996,1.7079,1.6872,3.1816,2.028,2.2991,2.4356,0.6379,2.7346,1.3343,2.6139,0.9791,6.991,1.087,0.1107,6.5573,1.0256,1.9394,1.1713,0.4881,1.1015,0.2658,3.7468,1.5498,0.7638,0.1379,4.9413,5.8842,3.5794,1.0026,4.9777,0.3243,1.2438,0.2455,1.9636,3.1991,0.1304,1.1842,4.0563,1.0663,0.2024,0.1281,0.6541,0.0568,0.0887,0.0032,0.0067,0.5712,0.3644,1.7339,3.4234,4.804,5.0613,5.6888,0.2027,0.4033,0.5398,1.4313,2.5297,0.5705,0.4186,1.3093,4.6,4.8031,0.0182,3.3665,2.8023,3.6896,1.326,0.8881,1.9584,5.2679,4.0649,1.0686,0.9235,2.5794,0.0941,3.2358,0.9933,6.121,0.4862,0.2085,0.0532,0.047,0.5763,3.9315,1.3167,0.5858,0.4121,0.0081,1.4859,5.634,5.8215,3.3899,5.5298,2.8003,5.6181,1.6637,4.4925,0.8812,1.6256,1.3631,2.4203,2.384,2.1451,3.0049,1.0106,2.1644,3.9305,1.0871,0.71,1.6689,1.0107,4.5699,1.3159,5.9977,0.1095,2.5513,0.1575,2.7432,4.1237,0.0009,3.0413,4.8808,1.9894,5.7851,3.5198,0.0055,1.6404,2.1614,0.4114,5.3222,3.5987,0.7152,0.3912,7.5705,0.7955,0.2541,0.3516,0.1705,0.5774,2.581,3.6902,0.9746,3.0907,0.0112,4.0187,4.2061,3.1616,3.4811,0.1831,2.2252,1.1538,4.583,1.8002,0.0026,3.7766,3.2821,1.2156,0.4667,0.9704,1.0805,2.4469,3.3495,0.6053]}
{"id":3491,"ended":true,"length":466,"gen_text":"In 1899, Yeats, Lady Gregory, Edward Martyn and George Moore established the Irish Literary Theatre for the purpose of performing Irish and Celtic plays. The ideals of the Abbey were derived from the playwright Charles Fox-Penelope :\nIt was the ambition of the Abbey to make the play known all over the world, and to make the whole earth a theatre. The play was played before the Lord Mayor on St. Nicholas Day in 1898. This play was produced after the Second World War during a public holiday in 1947 and included a rendition of the National Anthem. This show was accompanied by a symphony performed by the Belfast Symphony Orchestra. This show was also accompanied with an exhibition of the art and artistry of Irish painting and sculpture. The first theatre to incorporate an orchestra into its programming was the Belfast Festival Orchestra. At the same time a large screen was installed in another room to screen the performances live on stage.\nDuring the early decades of the twentieth century, many Irish and Celtic musicians were working with the Abbey, and there existed a vibrant and active musical community who participated in its activities during the second world war. These included the acclaimed Irish composer George Sheard, and the singer and choreographer Brian Kelly. Kelly, like Sheard, studied with the poet-turned-instrumentalist Edward Martyn.\nThe Abbey Theatre became the primary centre for the playing of Irish music with the great singer Mary Mallon, famous as 'the Great One', appearing regularly at the Abbey. Other famous performers who appeared at the Abbey included the English poet-performer William Butler Yeats, the New York Symphony Orchestra and the West Indian music legend George Michael.\nIn 1962, when the Abbey Theatre first ceased to perform, it represented a very small part of the musical life and achievements in Belfast. By the 1980s, the Abbey Theatre was a museum in the city which was largely used as a meeting place for the Belfast City Council's Chamber Music Orchestra. However, the building also served as the home of the Ulster Folk Music Association, whose activities lasted for 35 years. It was through this organisation that some of Belfast's finest songwriters produced their work. The Ulster Folk Music Association was founded in 1922 at the request of the Northern Ireland Folk Music Committee of the Royal Academy of Music (now known as the Royal Court).\nWith the rise of punk and indie rock styles, the Abbey Theatre is still very popular with musicians who wish to perform at a smaller venue.","token_len":496,"entropy":[10.269,0.378,9.5869,1.0514,3.2718,9.3052,0.8754,0.902,5.4592,7.9133,0.6193,1.9649,4.0214,3.0237,5.731,0.6135,2.9025,2.5421,4.1752,5.5552,0.9855,1.0874,0.007,2.5752,2.3365,4.0742,2.9845,0.8109,0.8728,1.705,12.017,0.4134,0.8199,7.9603,1.8723,7.2579,0.0919,0.8923,4.7019,0.6658,6.1213,4.4008,3.0297,5.0862,5.3052,6.9909,1.6358,6.8757,1.2156,2.1107,4.417,0.0875,0.6461,1.0209,0.4235,3.014,1.5326,3.1515,5.2768,4.1904,0.0757,0.3456,0.1345,1.1692,0.641,1.4211,2.1425,1.3769,4.598,5.1881,0.9441,0.6541,1.5262,2.3315,3.2816,1.7365,4.8629,4.0213,1.0796,4.8718,0.1354,3.6836,2.3407,1.3154,5.5791,1.1314,2.4053,3.6562,1.1441,3.9919,2.2452,0.9775,4.7404,5.7614,0.6086,5.2778,0.0382,0.0044,6.287,2.2296,5.3498,1.7508,1.1936,4.0193,2.9891,6.3109,1.8814,5.9312,0.0864,1.294,4.0274,0.0156,0.8052,3.5762,4.3259,0.5719,4.57,0.0606,0.8467,4.7938,0.1677,3.6779,0.1973,0.7231,4.7617,0.9255,0.0737,0.7305,3.3196,1.7777,0.4845,1.9196,1.2511,3.7273,2.3655,3.8512,0.324,2.1523,3.9404,2.3175,4.1891,1.1355,0.1018,1.7381,4.1181,1.2364,0.2869,0.675,1.7126,3.6536,5.6051,1.8235,5.7058,3.3174,2.0257,3.7631,0.6014,3.3284,0.1516,0.31,3.9406,4.6546,1.8892,1.6383,5.1015,0.6021,2.8275,0.0106,3.7825,4.3144,5.5952,0.617,0.7761,0.6682,8.5591,2.5464,2.6737,2.443,0.9506,2.895,6.2171,2.4958,1.9982,0.2104,1.2379,3.9395,0.2431,3.3669,4.2626,0.0917,0.1107,1.3169,0.01,0.498,4.0607,1.8842,2.4933,0.4193,4.4539,2.1027,4.1314,3.6163,0.9706,2.7475,2.3167,2.0584,3.8225,5.7392,0.5691,3.9867,2.1095,3.0665,2.9186,0.6865,4.5341,4.9571,0.1244,4.2522,1.4494,6.2853,0.9865,5.6341,3.0608,0.0076,0.2648,3.918,1.9588,1.7774,5.4818,2.0167,1.7382,3.9778,4.2636,3.874,0.6809,2.8735,0.477,4.5403,1.6336,5.1949,0.0045,5.2834,4.1151,0.4443,4.2328,2.3757,5.1393,1.3091,0.0001,0.2318,5.2356,1.984,1.0982,3.9194,3.8142,5.2499,0.0607,5.3702,0.3454,0.1493,3.5029,1.1799,0.0007,0.9533,1.7831,1.5786,1.6542,2.6267,3.5844,1.42,4.8865,3.9951,0.6006,1.1618,5.2625,0.2378,0.786,1.8519,4.4802,1.298,5.5459,4.0119,4.4165,5.036,0.048,1.9822,5.7882,3.0876,2.783,2.1426,4.5893,2.9398,0.5732,3.8522,1.9165,2.0719,0.3033,0.1546,1.0863,3.813,2.65,1.0297,2.1322,1.3596,0.6424,0.0467,0.0418,1.2645,1.3239,4.683,3.5875,3.6818,4.5176,0.0318,2.6618,0.5955,0.0002,0.0,0.3981,0.86,5.6628,0.4648,5.4956,0.2471,1.5367,0.3487,5.1102,2.2841,2.7133,3.9376,3.4269,3.4991,0.1187,0.8294,1.8105,4.6419,0.3523,4.2051,0.6154,0.737,0.4303,4.2887,5.7973,0.4253,3.582,1.1667,1.2044,6.5622,1.0159,4.4247,2.91,1.2463,0.0457,0.3309,2.9231,2.0544,3.4082,4.1551,2.5054,0.9824,0.2637,3.1107,0.6014,2.7425,0.1227,0.4039,1.175,0.7462,0.7086,0.9527,2.8733,4.3935,3.722,2.4711,2.0838,4.3546,1.7674,5.3442,3.2764,1.4443,0.2016,3.503,0.3061,0.4451,1.7006,3.0497,3.1174,0.2087,3.0857,4.749,1.1018,2.6816,0.5434,3.5967,0.0893,1.5124,3.4475,3.5163,2.4431,0.4745,1.0835,1.918,0.3591,0.2886,3.1978,1.7227,1.3636,1.9676,1.5105,3.4835,3.6985,5.717,2.269,6.4571,0.0073,0.5734,3.3318,0.6768,4.3284,1.2751,1.2154,0.1216,3.9146,0.1243,2.8844,0.0194,2.0179,4.2916,0.2589,5.339,0.6312,2.6814,0.8003,2.2413,2.0031,0.0645,0.163,0.1467,1.3951,2.0531,0.3078,3.5049,4.2378,0.212,1.6252,0.0068,0.6456,3.9807,0.0861,5.1945,0.4658,3.031,2.9369,0.0868,2.3866,3.207,0.1376,0.0334,2.855,1.5042,3.2937,0.0076,0.1176,0.1857,5.7896,1.993,1.7563,5.2535,0.3028,4.4314,0.2612,3.8382,1.6097,3.4695,0.7142,6.8832,1.1465,0.8257,0.788,0.5384,3.2835,3.7413,2.6,3.0209,1.2252,2.8172,2.8838,2.6016,0.0047,0.4774,1.936,1.5027,2.7221,0.502,0.5914]}
{"id":1268,"ended":true,"length":427,"gen_text":"USS McDougal ( Destroyer No. 54 \/ DD @ - @ 54 ) was laid down by Bath Iron Works of Bath, Maine, in July 1913 and launched in April 1914. She played a leading role in the Atlantic convoy action of January 1st - February 16th 1914 in which she sank the British cruiser HMS Rorqual and the French light cruiser RACRENNE as well as the British light cruiser BRISTOL and Italian frigate ALBERTO MONTEBELLI during a convoy operation in the Eastern Med.\n\n\nWhen her sister vessel USS TUSCUMBELL (AOE) broke into two in 1915 she was detached to make repairs. In the spring of 1916 she moved on to the Mediterranean where she participated in fighting with the battleship NEW ORLEANS during the Battle of the Atlantic. As a result of the Battle of the Atlantic she returned to her home ports where she remained until returning to the Navy Yard in 1917. On July 29th, 1916 she was recommissioned and returned to the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Late in April 1916 she was deployed for duty with the Atlantic Reserve Squadron, fighting with French frigates in the Mediterranean. This mission culminated in the sinking of the French cruisers BACQUER, DUNESNE, CHALMERT, PORTELUCCI, VERMEULEN (the command ship of the French Fleet), FOURVIER and LE MANS in the Gulf of Tchad. On January 6th, 1917 she was sent to France to take part in that country's successful offensive against German forces that resulted in the taking of Calais and Tours.\n\n\nFollowing the Battle of the Atlantic (June 1917 - March 1918) and the occupation of the Ruhr, she was transferred in 1918 to the United States Navy where she remained until decommission in 1919. She was laid down as a frigate with the first two turrets installed. The ship was built to serve under the United States flag (United States Naval Shipyard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania ).\n\n\nAt one time she was considered as a potential candidate for conversion for use as an aircraft carrier.

{"id":4468,"ended":false,"length":460,"gen_text":"In Wyoming, the cyclone is credited for the first known sighting of a white ibis in the state's history. In Montana, Kathleen dropped locally heavy rainfall approaching 2 inches ( 51 centimeters) over the course of the storm's history. But the heaviest rainfall over the course of the storm was recorded south of Kootenai County.\n\nAn interesting side story is the story of the white ibis near the storm.\n\nOn June 20, 2003, Kathleen and two friends went to see a flock of ibis on a pasture near where he lived. Kathleen and her friends were concerned that the weather might be turning for the worse. On the way back, Kathleen noticed a white butterfly emerging from a tree on the side of the road. She knew it was an ibis\u2014it's distinctive white crest reminded her of the bird she saw on the lawn while in the area in June 1997. She called the local Wildlife Warden, who advised her to leave it alone and to return after the storm had passed, as there was no danger to the animal.\n\nOn July 14, during the second half of Kathleen's storm, she called the Wildlife Warden again. She stated she was concerned for the ibis. Kathleen had seen the ibis in 1997, when it was very healthy. But the animal was weak and suffering from various ailments, including skin rashes (tinea capitella) affecting parts of its body. At the time, Kathleen was doing an internship at the National Audubon Society's Montana branch at Lake Louise Station. When asked about that incident as well, the Wildlife Warden said it was unimportant. But he mentioned that it was important that Kathleen check the ibis before she called him, and that she would not receive any warning on that day, as they had already gotten through an earlier storm that day.\n\nThe Weather Bureau issued a tropical cyclone warning that evening for the area where Kathleen had seen the white ibis. When she called back the Wildlife Warden the next day, she stated that the ibis had died, and he advised her that it may have died due to starvation or dehydration.\n\nIn any event, the Wildlife Warden said the ibis had died due to the intense moisture.\n\n(For more on this story, see Montana's Storm of 1983, and For some of my personal opinions on thunderstorms and animal behavior, see \"What Does It Really Mean if a Bird Chicks?\")","token_len":497,"entropy":[10.5701,0.2668,1.7576,13.0658,0.8112,2.0638,7.9053,2.9977,2.7574,3.1622,3.5926,5.0352,0.0521,0.9539,3.714,7.9688,0.0044,1.0726,0.6536,1.0782,2.8939,0.2913,0.4277,3.5716,5.3772,0.0686,11.5307,9.4843,12.3101,10.1117,4.338,11.8517,3.4642,0.5515,3.6804,11.9916,1.8433,1.2351,3.4382,0.9525,0.9869,0.0025,1.968,1.1621,3.5294,5.1399,0.4391,5.642,1.5664,2.9873,1.0755,3.9247,0.5909,1.5472,0.007,0.281,0.3881,1.1468,2.2798,7.1177,0.0535,6.2493,1.2838,0.0005,0.1034,0.6872,1.7508,0.7934,0.0008,5.5335,4.6477,2.0278,4.3957,2.6271,1.3307,3.8094,0.1205,1.4793,2.6261,0.0199,0.0029,5.3763,1.8249,4.4685,2.6903,2.8847,0.0002,2.9527,2.8165,3.4721,0.1534,4.1377,0.0863,2.0084,2.6072,3.9148,0.8065,3.4035,1.1908,2.9175,1.006,5.17,0.0227,2.5921,0.5344,2.7577,1.5681,5.0049,0.9657,5.7402,5.5909,1.8815,0.5077,2.1844,2.5482,1.5769,0.3237,1.5122,5.0416,1.4319,0.5591,5.8433,1.8135,1.3769,4.7774,1.4956,0.0777,0.248,1.6869,5.0229,0.7935,0.6081,0.7444,1.2124,0.8835,2.2157,0.9673,1.8828,5.7948,4.9337,0.1008,1.2683,2.8648,2.8429,0.3833,1.7673,0.026,0.1537,0.1651,0.2054,1.3828,4.4041,1.4922,0.3039,1.5665,0.3666,0.0027,5.2411,2.8012,2.3083,4.0618,1.1272,5.0956,5.9558,0.072,0.1543,0.8673,2.3486,3.0673,1.4813,2.3655,0.7072,4.6759,5.3136,2.9547,2.556,3.1717,2.5315,2.4014,4.4084,0.1847,1.9788,3.0053,0.832,2.4633,3.9142,3.9332,1.7091,0.7546,3.5577,0.2746,0.3115,2.8312,1.1724,0.3446,2.0685,1.9546,3.0219,3.274,0.5697,0.573,2.0277,0.0481,4.1468,2.4872,3.2034,0.9494,1.0303,1.8949,1.291,0.5558,3.3785,0.1399,0.6113,0.0002,2.9244,2.9005,3.6398,0.0518,6.7159,0.2625,3.4166,2.6739,0.0046,3.857,0.0187,3.7094,0.1249,1.3156,4.2571,0.4732,0.4366,0.0063,0.3485,1.118,1.4984,4.9646,2.3742,1.639,1.7329,2.8876,0.171,0.5222,0.0016,2.2269,3.7757,3.5989,1.7446,1.0228,1.4242,0.0021,2.404,1.9349,1.2054,2.9498,0.9528,0.5596,4.461,5.8729,1.1552,2.5231,1.9533,3.3359,1.207,4.2314,0.48,4.1081,0.2511,5.163,0.7905,1.4722,0.5539,4.7585,1.8056,0.0006,5.7456,5.6157,1.0894,1.7257,8.7232,0.1265,1.048,6.7511,3.9851,0.0134,0.1713,0.5054,0.709,4.941,0.8227,0.2659,0.2581,0.6945,1.9907,5.8536,3.9395,0.9457,0.706,0.568,3.0472,3.1737,0.0014,0.0001,0.071,0.7644,3.5345,3.9315,5.0864,4.9768,3.7054,4.8519,0.5229,4.4136,3.0941,1.6268,5.9434,2.086,6.5405,0.3513,0.2517,1.4636,0.4676,0.0018,1.8943,2.5344,0.5272,5.6783,1.5309,1.0829,3.9489,2.0767,4.5057,0.554,3.0685,0.6383,3.3138,1.0938,1.392,4.6384,1.9583,0.3992,0.0057,3.5027,1.5485,2.7904,2.0009,3.5462,2.2237,1.2635,1.1527,3.1612,2.6633,3.9449,0.9525,5.4762,4.9254,2.4411,1.7856,3.2652,1.426,3.5753,2.084,2.858,3.7592,2.8661,4.7089,1.435,0.9144,2.8307,0.7207,0.1768,0.5067,0.0003,2.449,3.4595,4.64,2.6173,0.5511,4.7235,2.0191,0.0046,0.6284,3.9102,2.1349,1.6455,0.9609,1.3097,2.438,0.1426,2.1465,0.5399,0.0355,2.4635,0.3363,0.0009,0.408,4.1273,1.4809,1.1318,2.1935,1.0038,1.464,0.0022,2.5876,0.3147,0.4649,0.1854,2.5572,2.5621,0.6454,1.0253,0.3069,0.0017,0.9888,1.4591,2.6296,1.0798,3.6821,1.9061,0.1782,1.7158,1.8275,4.6823,0.3712,1.4765,2.5638,0.0031,3.0976,2.4944,1.368,0.2563,1.3239,0.0002,3.2291,4.8713,1.0357,0.0055,1.1551,2.3051,0.0059,2.6492,2.2525,0.2367,0.0023,1.8734,1.2922,2.8418,0.0045,1.2208,3.8322,5.3783,2.3538,1.8743,0.0002,5.6237,3.5636,0.6519,1.9729,1.6691,0.9331,0.1875,0.6268,5.2841,2.0568,3.0224,1.4939,6.1306,2.4272,2.4198,5.7451,5.3472,3.329,3.0333,3.204,4.7557,0.6483,6.7351,0.2481,1.8464,5.2411,0.9885,0.112,0.3968,2.8956,3.9098,3.5069,2.136,3.5326,0.2093,3.8153,1.0358,1.5406,5.0006,1.9306,0.759,0.7161]}
{"id":4550,"ended":false,"length":452,"gen_text":"The opening track `` No Banker Left Behind `` references the financial bailout of 2007 and criticizes bankers and government. Alec Wilkinson of The New Yorker writes that the song `` ridicules the considerations of 'Too Big To Fail': the bankers who were bailed out while the workers paid for their mistakes; and the politicians who did nothing''.\n\nThe song also asks, ``Where's your love now?'' \ufffd In the opening line, Thom Yorke asks, ``Where's your love now? Where's all the love? Where's what he's selling us?'' This reference to the financial crisis is made clear in the final verse :\n\nHow many times shall your soul be broken \/ How many times?\n\nHow many times shall we repeat the phrase\n\nHow many times will we go on \/ How many times will we repeat the phrase\n\nHow many times will you repeat the phrase\n\nHow many times will we go on \/ How many times will we repeat the phrase\n\nI'm so sorry, there's so much here we have to say\n\nand so much more that you won't hear\n\nand I can't help telling you\n\nThere's so much here we have to say,\n\nthere's so much more that you won't hear,\n\nand I can't help telling you.\n\nThe song also references the 2008 presidential campaign. In the song, Thom Yorke asks, ``In every generation the question is asked:\n\nWho lost my life?\n\nWho lost my home?\n\nAnd who lost my loved one?\n\nWho lost me? Who lost you?''\n\nIn the closing lines, the song asks, ``And where, then, did the light end?\n\nAnd where, then, did I begin?\n\nAnd where, then, am I being reborn?''\n\nIn a 2011 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Thom Yorke said, ``It's about those things, those things I'm going through. The whole thing about it is, it can never be fully explained. And people ask if you know why people are so angry today, or want their own revolution. But when I write a song, I can tell you why they're mad. This isn't what I wrote about in my heart, but it's what my heart wrote about. It has nothing to do with the internet now.

{"id":4208,"ended":true,"length":450,"gen_text":"The Picardy Spaniel is a docile breed of dog and is fond of playing with children and bonds well with their master. It is described as having a gentle sociable nature, possessing a pleasant temperament and is considered a faithful companion to those who keep it. It is a popular breed in England and is extremely popular in the USA although it has a low-maintenance nature, it is hardy and extremely healthy.\n\nDescription\n\nPicardys are medium size dogs and are well balanced in terms of height, weight and proportions. They have a flat muzzle, large feet with thick pads and long legs. They range in colour from rich cream with tan markings, with white patches and a tan head; to jet black with a red face and tail. They have a strong chest, wide rounded hindquarters and long slender legs. Picardys have broad shoulders with small chest, short and narrow heads, large round ears, short muzzle, a short tail and short legs, and a long tail can be seen on both genders of the breed.\n\nPicards are a working breed so some of the other characteristics of a Picardy may include:\n\nIt is a small and compact breed.\n\nIt is hardy and adaptable.\n\nIt is often used to help control pests.\n\nIt is active and intelligent.\n\nIt is loyal and devoted to its master.\n\nThe Picard is a breed with a long breeding history in the USA, and despite the popularity it is not very popular in other parts of the world. A small number of members of the American Kennel Club list it as an eligible breed to register.\n\nPicardies are excellent with children; it enjoys being with visitors and enjoys playing with children. They are good house dogs, as they require minimal grooming and are easy to maintain. The size of their stomachs means that they do require a bit of exercise and, where possible, should live in homes with dogs.\n\nIt is not a difficult breed to train.

{"id":4901,"ended":false,"length":400,"gen_text":"The old wooden railway station, Estaci\u00f3n Pichilemu, constructed around 1925, is one of the National Monuments of Chile. In the O 'Higgins Region, 357 kilometres ( 222 mi ) of railway tracks and one of the largest underground stations of the world ( 6th largest railway station in the world with 1,300 metres (4,200 ft) long track length ) have been constructed as part of the railroad project.\n\nLocation\n\nEstaci\u00f3n Pichilemu is situated inside the northern edge of the province, on the main road from La Serena to Antofagasta, and is the centre of the city. The station has always been divided in two halves by a wooden fence, with one facing north (northbound track) and the second with southbound track.\n\nHistory\n\n(From left): Luso-Cameroonese artist Ronsart Gomes de Rocha, former Chilean president Eduardo Frei Montalva and poet Pablo Neruda.\n\nEstaci\u00f3n Pichilemu date back to 1925, when the government of the Province La Serena proposed to make the railways running through the region safer for passengers. A tunnel was built to divide the tracks, with one north entrance and one south entrance, but there were no trains running through the station at the time.\n\nIn 1930, the tunnel (with the entrance facing north) was enlarged and the rail lines extended to Antofagasta ( 3,450 m (10,300 ft ) away from Estaci\u00f3n Pichilemu. The railway system continued to grow through the 70s and 80s, and in 1941, it consisted of 7 lines, running south to west, each with 1,300 km (800 mi) of track, and connecting 8 communities. By 1954, trains stopped running between Pachuca and Pichilemu.\n\nIn 1963, the railway station was moved to La Serena from Antofagasta. A large wooden entrance (2.0 m (6 ft) high) replaced the wooden one with the one facing south, and the entrance facing north was demolished.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the population of the district grew significantly due to the railway system. Today, Estaci\u00f3n Pichilemu is a busy area, known for its shopping and nightlife. The centre of the city is located within the old station building.\n\n\nRelated Sites","token_len":499,"entropy":[7.1691,6.7514,7.2567,1.8878,2.3237,9.6562,5.2329,0.0459,4.6009,5.7551,4.5255,3.8841,1.7338,9.3966,4.5107,5.1731,0.507,1.2721,2.8499,0.031,0.23,8.4379,4.2656,0.0053,0.4852,2.1476,0.4916,3.7273,1.4178,9.7814,11.5166,3.036,0.4016,8.25,0.5835,15.6951,2.4851,2.0024,10.977,0.4668,3.0095,3.1844,1.8,1.5812,2.8762,4.4982,0.8375,0.1072,2.309,5.2806,1.8823,2.1715,0.7364,1.1123,4.3303,6.0641,4.8138,0.3241,3.8697,0.082,0.2656,0.0654,0.0494,4.3771,3.2038,0.4751,3.3553,2.7688,0.4421,2.0877,0.0428,3.55,0.056,0.4827,1.8052,2.2585,2.4361,1.9894,3.1142,0.149,2.7571,4.9487,0.8153,0.0048,0.2898,5.4713,2.2359,0.7646,1.3044,0.0442,5.2312,1.8219,0.0003,0.9491,0.047,0.0002,0.04,0.0017,0.0111,0.0086,0.8079,2.5907,5.8602,0.346,5.1184,3.9231,0.0057,0.2928,5.5258,4.8485,2.8306,0.3118,3.2035,0.9897,1.9258,3.4239,0.1143,0.0005,0.6719,4.7095,0.0089,0.0002,0.0002,1.8616,2.193,1.4656,2.9364,4.86,0.2223,0.552,3.0963,1.4471,1.7451,1.6066,2.6612,6.3367,0.2229,5.5516,1.8534,0.4185,3.5897,1.9928,0.6423,3.8265,1.7146,1.0912,2.4491,2.8714,6.6364,1.8469,2.9886,3.9661,2.2878,4.0442,0.3335,0.0642,0.2833,5.435,6.6962,2.7888,1.7223,0.5451,1.0529,1.2924,0.0002,2.5094,0.122,0.0003,6.5892,4.0392,2.3402,3.8315,5.3921,4.8098,2.7559,1.3826,5.5428,3.6059,7.8278,14.8209,0.6983,3.9222,5.172,7.6309,4.2161,4.6877,2.1546,4.9723,4.8427,2.3721,0.0127,1.0195,4.995,2.5256,2.1897,2.6222,0.0018,0.0023,0.0028,0.3602,0.0298,0.209,1.1928,5.5976,1.7306,0.1288,0.0111,1.7402,0.6565,0.0002,0.8699,0.0585,0.0004,0.012,0.0016,0.0072,0.0051,7.5334,0.147,0.0647,3.2665,0.5588,0.3165,0.8433,3.7989,0.7851,1.498,2.6125,7.4056,0.0037,0.0005,4.6,0.6418,5.0691,1.1523,5.4583,5.0653,1.4083,0.3131,1.5485,4.9526,1.8184,2.2485,1.3017,3.0754,5.7936,0.6959,2.015,2.1453,5.9885,0.0912,2.2043,1.5299,2.2377,1.8446,5.2104,9.2378,0.7452,0.7086,0.0101,0.2609,1.2254,4.293,4.1281,1.2408,1.3398,1.2295,1.0057,2.2657,0.7877,1.9218,1.372,0.6905,0.0456,0.2965,1.0895,0.0002,1.3488,3.3879,0.1994,0.793,4.8713,6.2659,3.3025,1.5548,2.9883,1.5354,0.4649,0.4594,0.1358,3.643,1.2234,1.3975,5.2087,2.4729,2.526,1.0366,1.6634,0.0016,0.0013,0.0004,3.1882,6.7226,1.3402,5.8242,3.5619,0.2245,1.0139,0.0009,3.2633,0.0171,3.2132,3.5022,0.9021,2.2099,0.0212,0.0006,0.0181,0.0008,0.0046,0.0042,0.6692,1.6654,2.2081,5.1549,3.5466,0.5014,1.9279,4.3444,0.1823,6.1336,0.4424,0.5748,0.1182,0.0114,0.4399,1.6971,1.5038,5.0733,0.6809,2.9504,6.4826,0.0191,4.0601,1.3077,1.502,4.6446,5.3628,0.8649,3.4528,1.3043,4.3633,1.0403,3.7569,0.3087,2.2028,2.575,0.1187,0.9307,0.0256,0.1082,0.16,0.1455,2.6791,1.4042,2.9499,4.633,3.7276,0.7591,3.2302,4.3925,0.0944,5.7578,3.8565,0.3455,2.763,4.4674,3.3418,1.3527,0.2029,3.8566,0.4114,0.3498,0.0339,1.1171,0.4328,0.0002,1.1768,4.0108,0.0672,0.7458,1.5271,2.9435,0.3632,4.3517,0.8027,3.3427,0.0676,0.0004,4.4581,0.9744,0.0013,0.001,0.0001,1.3816,3.9027,3.7919,3.227,5.8249,3.3526,3.9313,1.24,4.1405,0.874,0.9523,0.5742,0.8077,0.1811,0.635,0.4913,6.211,0.0625,1.3687,2.91,3.239,0.8213,2.3701,0.4917,1.4694,1.018,0.9741,1.1517,3.3158,2.486,0.0768,0.4651,2.2514,0.4637,1.1267,0.0002,1.2815,2.2702,2.5598,1.6699,0.0568,0.1834,0.7401,5.8855,0.4967,1.0138,5.4182,1.9901,2.9519,2.318,0.0098,0.394,4.3137,3.2647,1.5661,4.9927,0.1681,1.2365,0.0087,0.0002,0.0051,0.0021,0.0025,0.0023,0.6098,1.9604,3.9019,5.0249,1.0125,4.8649,0.2909,0.3516,3.8511,1.648,2.0554,0.2388,0.4691,2.289,5.2806,0.4854,0.3461,0.7718,0.4259,1.59,3.3408,0.3433,3.5474,0.7968,3.0994,1.4343,5.013,0.0003,4.8542,3.3094]}

{"id":4808,"ended":true,"length":459,"gen_text":"After the 1903 destruction of the original wooden bridge at Belvidere, plans to construct another bridge started immediately. After the storm, the substructure of the crossing had survived the strong storm.\n\nIn October 1917, the bridge was rebuilt and named the Bridge of Oak Park Crossing because of its resemblance to the village bridge in the city.\n\nThe crossing was in use until 1940. With the reconstruction of the Belvidere bridge in 1918, the bridge fell victim to vandalism and vandalism was so intense that the city decided on replacing the original bridge with a new one that would give the crossing a more attractive appearance.\n\nThe new bridge was named the Bridge of Oak Park Crossing and the name Oak Park Crossing stuck on the new crossing for decades to come.\n\nWhen the old Oak Park Crossing burned to the ground on April 6, 1949, more than 80 feet of the bridge and the neighboring crosstown portion of the street were destroyed causing extensive damage to some homes and significant damage to the street. As part of the recovery effort, a new bridge was built at Oak Park Crossing.\n\nAt 9:50 p.m. on March 5, 1981, demolition of the old Oak Park Crossing bridge began. Crews began moving the large iron rods from the old bridge to the new Oak Park Crossing bridge. The heavy equipment used to move the metal also left two long, wide crests of destruction along the road.\n\nAs we watch the demolition go by and the heavy machinery move by we can imagine the pain of families who had homes directly across the Belvidere bridge. They had a long time to wait for one of their homes to be rebuilt because of the reconstruction of the Oak Park Crossing bridge.\n\nIn the late 1990's, a new bridge was constructed across the street but with an older bridge design. The new bridge was not a good bridge because of the old bridge design and the new bridge took three years to complete.\n\nToday, the Oak Park Crossing Bridge is over 35 years old and is in poor condition and needs major repairs. The Oak Park Crossing Bridge is still owned by the city of Oak Park.\n\nThe residents, businesses, and visitors from around the world who cross the bridge daily are in for a treat today because the new Bridge of Oak Park Crossing will connect Oak Park and Belvidere via a new pedestrian and bike path crossing the old Oak Park Bridge at 2nd Street and a new bridge crossing.","token_len":500,"entropy":[1.9443,11.2244,8.6365,0.2543,0.5359,5.0096,6.3389,3.2694,3.5747,6.8841,3.0197,0.2494,0.0001,0.5427,5.9127,2.8543,3.4034,3.5789,1.887,7.0394,4.7802,0.419,4.3822,1.8197,7.5147,2.2709,1.1252,10.8087,0.1542,0.9498,0.1167,8.4215,3.6565,7.1276,1.2972,5.6796,4.4676,2.462,2.8375,0.0277,2.5054,4.6362,4.9343,0.2156,0.9545,1.7667,0.2917,2.6941,1.9431,3.8588,1.0895,4.6199,0.6299,5.7069,2.5483,5.9543,6.3418,0.6477,0.8002,2.3756,0.0718,0.5261,5.1502,3.8493,1.9455,1.5853,3.4776,0.7734,1.2327,0.0002,1.304,4.287,0.7845,5.0073,0.8787,0.6838,4.4043,1.4206,5.9449,0.3626,5.3464,0.1307,0.2834,3.6515,0.0231,0.0002,0.0005,1.789,1.2506,4.5661,0.1482,0.4799,1.4871,5.5169,4.7447,0.0559,3.1308,1.027,2.0505,1.5915,4.7834,4.2608,0.2408,1.127,2.6206,2.9739,5.3025,3.6792,0.4591,3.644,0.962,1.3075,0.4577,1.107,0.8398,3.6558,1.0517,5.4038,1.113,2.2222,0.9446,0.7937,3.9031,0.1898,0.1687,0.6404,0.0002,1.0672,1.0445,0.2426,0.5097,2.7035,0.464,1.8768,0.0445,0.4529,0.0227,0.1938,1.6534,2.5053,3.3794,3.129,0.0772,1.1479,2.9649,5.2948,0.4226,2.1101,2.5862,1.7316,2.1868,1.8403,0.0148,0.0623,0.5139,0.0002,4.3758,0.4005,3.1443,2.9437,0.0203,1.3398,4.1924,1.7989,0.003,0.001,2.0577,2.5555,3.3927,0.05,4.0395,0.084,6.0571,0.099,4.1618,4.9872,0.0799,0.4465,1.7439,3.5038,1.5961,5.5731,5.7242,1.484,0.6036,4.6819,0.7959,0.2317,3.4253,0.6857,0.4271,7.6552,3.4094,0.3432,0.2964,5.9612,1.3409,1.4696,6.4412,1.7935,0.0201,1.0984,3.1435,1.0552,5.1939,4.0399,0.0025,0.2407,5.2439,1.3788,0.1607,2.0223,0.7863,0.8242,0.1974,0.7927,2.6623,1.85,0.1053,0.3652,1.4966,0.5149,0.0002,4.6629,6.5315,0.7124,3.6263,1.253,0.0012,0.0009,0.129,0.1597,2.6353,3.6914,0.0201,4.2073,0.1044,7.5472,2.3453,0.0979,0.5442,1.1181,0.0085,0.106,2.3424,0.5708,0.5935,5.682,0.0026,2.1641,5.3387,0.5156,5.5028,4.9097,4.0945,2.9787,0.1756,1.56,0.2943,1.2491,0.1715,0.0496,2.6335,0.0077,0.1086,0.2324,0.6639,1.5237,5.2041,2.0972,1.9384,0.8171,1.3771,0.0602,4.0499,5.5904,3.6624,5.5842,4.4997,1.8289,4.0569,5.7266,1.5072,1.6201,3.7859,2.7874,0.1448,3.0538,0.9261,0.601,0.0002,3.7946,6.3615,4.1683,0.4725,0.7518,4.5956,3.0211,3.3402,1.2882,3.0073,1.1236,2.2049,3.8742,4.3921,1.4699,3.0248,0.6998,3.4887,1.5474,5.0011,0.8317,1.4569,4.2348,3.4918,1.64,0.3453,5.1184,0.0185,0.0002,0.0007,2.1502,0.9504,3.8423,1.531,3.5533,2.887,2.1622,0.0728,0.9034,1.0829,6.7183,0.7051,0.588,1.3136,0.0329,0.2189,0.5593,4.2884,0.9955,0.2297,4.3719,0.6769,0.1606,0.9879,0.0065,0.2654,0.3213,0.1574,0.5194,0.0002,3.0475,1.6767,3.2594,1.3028,1.3861,0.4798,2.0022,1.2063,0.5336,0.1666,1.5761,3.5802,0.3162,0.95,5.3243,4.3175,3.9909,4.8058,1.6994,2.8627,0.7293,1.2088,0.5821,0.1711,1.1746,3.5847,2.9805,2.5883,2.8365,3.4327,1.4749,0.8385,3.4031,0.8862,0.5808,1.3004,1.2734,2.7439,0.1278,5.7135,4.4199,0.2978,0.176,1.3801,0.2319,0.8042,0.0002,3.6962,0.3606,0.5984,0.7764,0.0104,0.1104,2.2322,0.5205,5.6812,5.6497,0.1342,0.0136,0.626,1.5083,1.3547,1.9963,0.2335,3.063,1.509,3.1263,0.8134,0.202,1.3195,2.6998,0.0095,0.1102,0.8567,0.8504,4.6591,3.974,0.3321,0.1259,0.6483,0.7792,0.7081,0.0008,1.5461,1.312,0.0002,1.5002,7.1421,4.8777,0.9956,1.1916,0.3253,1.0404,4.5557,2.5081,0.1006,0.6521,1.1769,3.3453,0.5248,0.754,2.6551,1.5466,3.2621,1.0545,0.2489,2.3891,3.6211,1.9866,0.8445,2.165,2.9879,0.0433,0.0077,0.005,0.0155,1.7297,5.9468,2.2743,0.0051,1.8291,0.7543,0.0055,0.0001,0.0002,4.1016,0.7305,1.0585,2.0175,1.4812,1.5866,1.3004,6.3208,0.6834,4.0494,1.6924,0.0105,2.1744,2.2682,6.4852,0.2683,0.6966,0.9276,5.6427,0.7361,1.6535,2.7342,4.9814]}
{"id":4979,"ended":true,"length":449,"gen_text":"The only storm to form in August this year formed on August 31 from an area of circulation in the ITCZ over the Gulf of Tehuantepec. It became a tropical depression on August 30 and moved over the Lesser Antilles to Puerto Rico on September 6.\n\nThe storm formed near Puerto Rico south of Cabo Rojo and has maintained a west to northwest flow, moving east-southwest into the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Irma has maximum sustained winds of 45 miles per hour and a minimum central pressure of 950 millibars. Irma is projected to pass near northern Cuba, north-northeast Mexico, and southeastern Florida. On the forecast track, the center of the storm is expected to move near or over the Lesser Antilles, with maximum sustained winds near 55 miles per hour or more.\n\nMaximum sustained winds have been increasing steadily over Hispaniola since early Monday into early Tuesday with the hurricane bearing down on Cuba and northern coastal areas of Florida and the Bahamas. Irma will strengthen quickly, with peak sustained winds of 75 mph, increasing to 95 mph, as it approaches the Lesser Antilles and southern Florida, the hurricane center said.\n\nWhile the storm's center should move well to the west of the Lesser Antilles, Irma will continue to be a strong Category 4 hurricane, with wind gusts in excess of 175 mph. The hurricane will still be moving west-northwest as it nears the Caribbean.\n\nIrma could become a Hurricane Hurricane conditions later on today and Saturday, and a post-tropical cyclone by as late this week or early next week. The hurricane could continue to strengthen into a major Category 5 storm as the core moves westward. The storm will generate extreme rainfall amounts of 10 to 15 inches and dangerous surf and rip currents.\n\nResidents and property owners in coastal areas in the Caribbean and the southeastern United States need to take prudent steps to protect themselves against possible storm surge. Flooding is possible on large islands and could result in life threatening conditions during the weekend. There could be major damage with winds reaching 120 mph, particularly to low lying areas.\n\nHurricane warnings continue to be in place for portions of the Florida Keys. Residents and business owners must avoid all unnecessary travel and any form of risk. The National Hurricane Center says you should not be complacent, but should be prepared for the fact that this could be your last real hurricane season if Irma has a good track.","token_len":500,"entropy":[5.5316,11.0133,4.1174,4.4507,1.3203,5.3951,3.8119,0.0441,8.1613,2.4802,1.7935,4.0588,5.0383,2.5868,2.4928,0.3461,8.3462,2.4244,0.1127,7.8033,0.3965,0.0492,3.9617,0.7994,3.1777,0.0446,9.1274,1.0212,0.0072,0.0003,1.1685,2.1313,4.5548,0.7257,0.8405,0.6562,0.9266,2.0026,2.4678,0.9352,2.381,3.6201,0.6591,5.7907,0.0014,0.0014,0.0014,4.3828,5.6732,0.0325,1.5637,1.2475,3.7954,0.4152,1.7983,0.0016,1.6368,2.6862,4.0124,2.8126,2.5106,0.0158,7.3717,0.0728,2.851,0.0137,0.3624,0.0194,1.2298,4.7411,4.5909,0.9772,2.6691,2.2483,2.0088,3.3086,2.7795,2.8161,2.8869,0.9274,4.183,0.043,4.627,0.1864,1.0254,0.6327,2.3011,4.3974,0.0228,0.0928,0.4074,6.0596,2.0008,2.6169,0.0102,0.0235,0.2647,4.2053,1.4319,0.0803,0.0005,1.0889,2.3193,1.3246,0.0144,0.0021,0.012,5.4383,0.3445,0.0001,0.0084,0.0657,3.24,0.4796,4.4665,0.0085,2.4567,1.2248,6.8186,0.9077,2.8082,4.0591,1.4429,0.7906,0.0006,0.0044,3.6022,0.414,0.5602,3.2431,0.8422,2.2135,5.3246,1.425,0.4389,0.0132,0.2676,1.2473,1.0432,0.0868,0.692,0.3447,0.6445,0.35,0.009,0.73,1.1881,0.1699,0.3912,0.4762,1.9819,0.0002,0.0001,0.0004,2.9158,4.2263,2.3897,0.0851,0.0303,1.0866,4.1854,0.1681,0.0071,0.0009,5.1954,2.846,0.5024,0.6244,0.0002,5.6263,0.0678,0.0725,1.1918,2.0644,2.394,4.8566,2.2111,5.9688,0.0013,2.0025,2.5051,3.656,6.0651,2.3753,0.15,4.3601,1.7292,3.5598,4.5861,0.3199,0.1037,2.3311,1.4641,3.2319,6.0839,0.8781,0.2834,1.5093,2.5438,1.1182,1.805,0.357,1.6929,2.7675,3.9498,4.9846,2.252,2.0955,3.2023,0.5589,0.0256,0.9553,1.7638,2.1472,2.8859,3.7204,0.3355,2.7647,0.0391,2.3287,2.022,0.0808,1.4546,0.4856,0.9224,0.0003,0.0006,0.0008,1.8813,4.4758,0.8614,2.8485,2.7419,1.5609,0.0594,0.1891,0.082,0.4863,0.0002,5.0129,1.2492,1.7771,1.6333,1.9259,3.7842,1.4214,3.6091,1.6833,0.0075,1.83,0.4451,0.8183,0.2505,0.0004,0.0003,0.0012,0.8975,2.1027,1.2513,2.4509,0.0932,2.6517,0.5754,3.195,1.2537,1.0966,0.5413,2.4447,0.7747,3.533,0.8992,0.0017,2.667,0.2039,0.0069,2.5088,0.1868,0.8753,1.9814,1.3649,2.9665,4.9814,1.127,3.6541,1.8602,0.8613,0.1192,0.001,4.4558,0.1774,2.0973,0.0113,1.287,3.0656,2.2738,0.4592,0.0002,1.2173,0.0002,3.9329,2.4472,0.2239,6.5112,2.4219,5.6992,3.674,2.1932,5.9981,2.3585,4.0076,1.0391,2.5733,2.2891,3.4781,0.0992,0.0044,0.0002,0.4381,0.006,1.8631,8.3021,1.1884,3.9788,0.5485,1.4407,0.7422,0.0375,0.0215,0.4454,2.2984,1.3353,2.0669,4.3292,0.3663,0.7927,1.89,0.5246,1.7419,2.2931,0.4254,2.105,2.2112,3.6882,4.7498,1.6436,3.1488,2.0222,1.8673,2.9309,2.0012,2.1534,5.9331,5.1337,0.5656,1.3599,0.9275,1.286,0.1839,0.9268,0.0055,2.824,3.143,1.796,0.8693,0.0273,0.1169,1.095,0.4704,0.0002,5.4123,3.2758,5.0078,1.1268,0.863,5.0411,0.4287,2.6388,0.8916,2.8455,1.1982,0.9509,2.5682,0.6937,0.0008,4.1271,0.0064,1.0857,5.954,1.0666,0.1836,1.0042,0.8216,1.8351,2.3299,0.9556,0.1325,1.6724,5.217,0.4342,1.8476,1.3825,4.3406,5.3753,2.0776,1.1903,4.8119,2.1592,0.0318,0.6991,1.0069,2.9544,5.4194,0.6267,2.858,0.5253,5.2804,2.84,0.5132,4.8493,0.9821,6.1042,3.4539,2.0848,3.7154,0.2796,1.7981,4.9423,1.9092,1.1973,0.3147,0.3976,0.6125,0.708,0.0002,2.9691,0.0244,1.0648,4.3216,0.067,0.1154,0.2638,3.1758,0.2284,2.0948,0.0063,0.4111,1.4335,1.293,3.5872,3.2328,1.6611,1.7895,0.1822,4.6643,5.5797,1.4086,2.0872,0.0545,2.1,5.5638,5.0319,0.0087,5.0405,2.2392,2.5971,1.8627,0.2876,0.0012,3.2624,5.0898,0.4436,2.329,2.6434,4.3346,0.0031,2.2538,1.7359,2.1761,1.8495,0.3117,1.141,0.6626,6.7817,0.1021,2.2282,2.4079,0.3083,3.4323,0.4505,5.9114,2.9683,0.5894,4.5017,1.2926,4.3124,1.0163,2.9467,0.1382,0.5695]}

on certain practices that will make him look good.\nA coach, or any person in a position of authority, must recognize that some things are very important and cannot make or break what they do.\nWhen you hire a coach, if you can put his experience to good use, he will give you a better product and you will win a lot more games.","token_len":500,"entropy":[3.2287,5.8837,0.4462,1.2897,8.746,5.8878,0.6469,6.1276,3.6348,5.0735,0.1334,1.3329,1.7175,6.0292,1.519,0.3168,14.4979,3.3149,2.5797,0.0002,5.9503,0.0483,1.3631,3.7028,3.9642,2.0542,2.0794,2.2172,1.2952,1.2305,0.1325,2.7131,2.2416,4.3027,0.0015,0.0058,0.9191,6.6013,0.7956,1.2894,3.8744,0.3768,0.1088,2.0812,3.7278,1.5483,2.7768,0.0007,0.6783,1.2884,10.9816,0.373,1.9428,4.2774,2.1869,0.3646,0.0358,0.0002,3.9926,0.0226,0.6689,0.0003,0.0059,3.9673,2.2378,0.3052,1.5181,0.3025,1.0095,1.3574,3.4871,3.5201,3.2632,0.1118,0.4961,0.171,3.0605,0.7061,1.6409,0.0043,2.7626,0.0993,0.3992,0.0003,0.0051,2.0209,0.124,1.0337,3.0431,0.9902,1.6684,2.2493,0.0509,0.0311,1.6726,0.2285,4.8417,0.1875,3.8736,0.6613,6.2158,0.0124,0.0634,0.9913,0.769,2.5089,3.3675,3.5869,2.8972,0.1194,4.3995,1.5298,0.0578,0.1944,2.201,0.4442,1.7701,0.0004,0.0026,5.1209,1.621,0.9799,0.6827,2.1776,2.2449,0.1044,1.4692,0.2858,1.7519,4.0994,0.3401,1.4874,0.6292,3.8072,0.5213,3.0808,3.9007,0.8135,0.4073,0.671,4.5337,0.2954,2.4361,4.5108,1.9437,0.6681,0.086,2.7621,4.0518,0.0061,0.1455,2.7536,0.1481,0.1931,0.2082,1.5796,0.843,1.2512,0.0007,0.0718,0.0541,0.9388,3.3522,0.9459,0.0039,0.09,0.2177,4.2296,0.3021,0.1422,2.3491,0.9697,5.7673,1.821,0.179,2.8793,1.6376,4.5553,0.1986,0.0052,0.032,3.3683,3.0501,0.9596,2.826,0.5388,4.2232,5.5095,1.8746,0.5067,2.9122,1.6417,0.0404,2.2127,0.0125,0.0044,0.0022,0.0045,0.088,3.7321,2.315,0.6811,1.2849,1.1619,0.1527,0.0026,0.0044,0.0271,3.334,0.1966,0.1434,1.6348,0.0006,0.009,2.6859,3.1607,0.4042,3.8497,1.0629,1.3212,1.067,3.8341,0.0606,2.174,0.0001,1.4461,4.35,1.128,5.7306,2.1735,4.9684,0.925,0.1675,0.7298,1.7346,1.8484,1.379,2.8969,1.1438,0.1918,0.55,0.7969,4.0719,0.8401,0.3912,5.1746,0.9797,0.2139,0.5142,0.4502,0.9617,0.2227,0.4681,0.2751,0.9773,4.939,1.1174,1.9664,0.0032,0.1226,1.4235,0.2333,1.9335,1.7854,0.2366,0.6456,4.4365,0.9738,0.3789,0.0095,0.339,4.3549,2.032,0.0424,1.1456,0.1287,0.0035,2.7724,4.7094,1.4164,2.576,1.6544,0.1442,0.7455,3.8386,4.3741,1.1114,0.0186,2.404,0.4566,3.0746,0.0769,2.546,3.1072,0.2777,0.4269,1.3078,2.8971,1.7808,2.7174,0.2343,0.1509,0.4117,1.0634,0.1924,7.0,4.0382,3.5699,1.8375,0.0943,1.802,3.2111,0.1079,0.1809,0.5168,2.381,1.6283,0.0206,4.0219,0.0121,0.0311,0.0017,4.027,0.0011,0.0111,0.4485,0.0673,0.9456,5.2728,1.0755,2.0779,1.0902,2.2358,2.54,0.4201,2.1248,2.5424,2.2142,4.8514,0.8302,4.2138,0.6069,0.2327,4.6123,1.0611,3.084,6.7638,0.2684,2.254,1.0816,3.8567,0.8382,3.469,4.6441,1.4596,4.0263,1.4137,0.3105,0.8235,0.7208,0.857,3.0502,2.3918,3.2842,1.1113,0.0623,0.0147,0.2016,0.1663,3.4811,1.313,1.9194,4.1311,0.4697,0.0112,4.5178,1.8321,0.6601,0.7486,0.1994,4.3123,6.5825,3.0322,0.001,1.6083,1.7711,0.2104,3.229,0.6272,4.4257,2.9069,0.2438,1.7317,1.6782,3.006,1.7989,1.2341,0.9053,2.5133,5.2939,3.6568,0.8339,0.0247,1.7069,2.1296,4.2644,0.1287,4.1368,5.9491,0.5864,1.4621,6.8113,0.008,1.8896,0.2957,0.0535,2.3997,3.9201,3.4143,4.9721,1.4333,1.021,0.1547,2.2407,5.3907,0.0004,0.1201,3.9472,5.3464,2.3121,3.252,2.516,1.1078,1.1309,0.2628,1.3303,0.0831,3.3968,0.9158,4.7974,3.2728,1.4559,1.5139,1.8127,1.6274,0.3591,0.1004,0.5165,0.2089,1.6555,5.1905,0.7886,3.9606,1.5286,0.8524,4.6049,0.6871,1.2578,3.6518,8.0205,1.663,0.0164,5.4943,1.5324,0.928,0.2496,0.0477,4.3259,1.8601,3.8034,0.4141,0.4006,0.387,5.4951,0.6862,3.0599,4.9744,3.5758,4.5286,1.1155,0.6222,0.0206,0.2339,1.7312,0.5637,3.3941,0.2841,1.3268,1.8675,0.931,2.9737,1.7919,0.2671,3.284,3.3634,0.2581,0.1996,0.1915,0.2777]}

S\u00e1nchez-Carrillo and Dr Marc-Andr\u00e9 Hincapi\u00e9 of the National Centre for Scientific Research, and conducted using the latest tools of genetic technology, including analysis of mitochondrial genomes from specimens with well-preserved tissues, such as skulls, bones and feathers.\n\nThey collected specimens from the area where the dodo's bones were first found, and those with the most extensive fossil records, at the Old Bone Cave.\n\nAs well as shedding new light on the dodo, the study has also shed new light on the evolution of mammals, which was previously thought to have progressed primarily due to the expansion of the animal population over a large geographic space.\n\n\"This research confirms that mammals, and perhaps even mammals' closest relatives, have been evolving continuously in the Old World,\" Dr S\u00e1nchez-Carrillo said.","token_len":501,"entropy":[1.8755,4.2258,2.2437,0.0585,0.2275,11.0185,0.145,1.2827,2.3815,0.0217,1.7101,6.163,10.8,0.0875,6.0194,7.0552,0.0002,1.1128,3.5862,8.4878,0.6103,2.089,1.5043,4.8103,1.8196,1.0498,3.1149,3.4148,1.5577,6.8349,1.756,0.5356,10.1575,0.3766,10.6749,1.2634,0.4146,1.2698,0.0109,1.598,2.4597,0.2685,2.0372,0.0019,2.2244,1.4956,6.6897,4.6413,5.8174,2.0475,5.8403,0.2818,3.3869,0.3011,3.4191,3.5558,0.6752,0.1986,5.6587,0.4373,4.8592,3.0217,0.2713,3.5719,5.5137,0.2626,5.789,1.04,0.6373,1.5621,0.0002,5.1998,1.4128,1.3919,0.0058,1.5001,4.8369,2.5281,2.1272,0.157,0.1093,1.8674,4.1051,4.8905,1.5144,0.718,4.5527,0.9374,1.1552,3.2881,5.4653,0.5915,2.2142,2.9638,0.0268,3.5245,5.2426,0.0315,3.7209,2.0173,0.7102,5.0827,1.9626,4.2257,5.6152,2.3361,5.3368,0.8484,3.1527,5.1533,0.1009,2.1254,1.5821,0.8588,0.4539,0.0871,0.0002,2.1393,5.0782,5.5444,3.0956,0.5977,2.2705,0.0076,2.6583,2.3187,0.7943,1.0761,3.6415,3.0744,0.0977,2.6122,0.943,1.1542,0.0168,0.7654,5.614,1.0954,4.2622,5.3944,0.1172,3.174,0.1442,6.3899,2.1361,5.2264,1.7023,4.2043,1.306,4.4497,0.0692,0.0638,2.6133,0.962,0.2516,0.0002,1.7643,2.7286,0.0066,3.205,1.4659,3.9281,0.0187,2.2295,0.0004,1.634,1.3775,1.6181,1.7707,0.6386,6.4113,1.8126,0.0889,1.4216,1.8491,1.3744,1.6649,2.2418,0.3709,1.3463,1.8586,0.7148,0.728,0.1558,1.5414,5.693,0.6438,2.0645,3.5315,3.5828,1.0988,0.6108,6.4176,0.2933,2.7031,0.6538,1.9325,4.2876,0.3983,0.3806,5.0857,0.0465,1.448,4.8321,0.1768,0.0376,0.8334,0.629,3.9197,5.2259,0.9159,0.0104,1.9407,2.4866,0.1546,5.1986,3.5852,0.003,0.1735,0.2805,0.0002,4.1807,2.3385,7.1026,0.8087,0.0026,0.0685,6.0487,1.2385,1.0466,4.9488,3.1676,5.824,3.0059,1.3363,3.7598,0.4632,0.1557,3.6043,4.3637,0.9257,3.5216,0.4295,0.7433,2.1042,2.5444,6.6904,0.0279,0.1013,2.9158,1.5345,5.4091,0.0043,0.3381,0.7435,1.3676,5.0971,0.1565,2.6624,1.9461,2.1744,0.2145,0.7092,1.3156,3.5857,0.1475,0.0155,0.4611,0.2707,1.5206,0.0242,3.2928,0.0099,0.0002,0.9966,0.1217,0.0002,0.2875,4.3349,2.5149,4.6808,0.5503,0.7105,4.6948,1.0318,2.0896,2.4172,0.9967,0.2348,0.1306,1.9496,0.6528,3.2635,0.628,4.6239,1.5664,4.0345,2.372,0.8397,1.1066,2.7814,0.7978,1.8317,4.1142,1.2611,3.0895,5.8148,3.3486,0.1983,0.0002,1.8993,4.019,3.7081,4.7084,6.6477,1.974,2.5092,0.0176,1.0885,5.3113,4.1998,0.0143,4.4724,0.6572,4.3564,0.2436,0.0,0.0,0.4799,3.5205,2.2118,0.8457,1.9524,1.1921,5.3055,3.4069,0.9434,0.0019,4.3337,5.1549,1.561,0.0008,1.3736,0.2542,2.3268,1.4141,0.1131,0.0081,0.0157,2.5528,2.7453,5.0432,4.1842,1.5571,4.2256,4.9061,1.8823,2.0754,3.6629,2.1298,0.7903,5.6546,0.045,0.898,3.7396,3.0277,3.8794,4.5752,4.1792,0.069,0.3009,0.0001,2.5872,2.5726,2.4524,0.0038,4.2552,1.8539,1.9587,0.3812,0.6452,0.1205,0.0661,0.0002,2.8167,5.3635,2.4147,0.7036,1.9288,5.5918,2.2423,0.216,0.3237,0.034,2.6416,2.4975,0.5875,2.9143,0.8992,0.9068,1.5875,5.9372,3.7472,1.7244,1.6605,4.526,2.5743,1.291,0.9401,5.1378,0.9875,5.7378,6.1504,1.8777,1.9542,0.2726,0.0002,5.0719,0.5942,0.0075,5.1057,1.7874,0.004,0.0145,0.1709,0.2547,0.0023,3.1555,0.3011,1.5035,1.7304,1.5013,2.2883,1.7038,0.006,0.017,0.5704,1.6763,0.0726,3.8284,1.3013,2.7125,3.5044,1.9644,0.7296,0.042,0.5451,5.0583,6.0993,5.1288,0.0018,1.0075,3.4833,0.0547,1.6825,4.9132,3.8479,3.3355,2.2018,2.9937,1.1525,2.8051,0.5016,0.0921,0.0002,0.9327,2.4767,2.4349,3.8878,0.5216,1.4429,2.8893,2.5105,4.3963,1.707,4.6009,3.2323,0.5367,0.6176,0.1408,2.3347,1.8776,1.7229,3.0181,1.5421,0.5031,1.0071,0.007,2.4395,1.3364,1.8222,0.0009,0.0002,0.0001,0.0085,0.0154,0.0017,0.0013,0.2521,0.066]}

This brochure included a section on Johor -based resorts. The information on the resort, however, does not include photographs of these resorts.\n\nMeanwhile, Johor Darul Aman (JDA) has claimed that the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) never gave permission for any such commercial use.\n\nThe JDA said that in an appeal to the STB, the JDA said that the brochure was the only copy of the document provided by the STB. In addition, the brochure was issued by the STB's Marketing and Promotion Department and not by the STB's Press Information Department.\n\n\"The JDA said it had requested the STB to correct any errors in the brochure but was told not to interfere with the STB's commercial activities,\" said a spokesman for JDA.\n\nHe added the STB has since complied with the JDA's request. Singapore Press Holdings has now replaced the brochure with a \"smaller, more modern version\" of the brochure.\n\nHe said there could be a few inaccuracies in the brochure that the STB had removed after being advised of these problems, but they were extremely minor and nothing that needed to be corrected.\n\nMeanwhile, the Singapore Tourism Board also said that it had received a copy of Malaysia's appeal and \"we carefully examined its content\".\n\n\"The STB has now instructed Malaysian partner companies to delete any photographs of JDA resorts from their brochures. However we fully intend on continuing our efforts to promote Malaysia as a holiday destination,\" said a spokesman for the STB.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Malaysia has submitted information on its tourism industry in Johor to Singapore, which was received on April 29. This information, the Malaysian said, did not include photos of Johor-based resorts.\n\nWhen contacted, Indonesian President Yudhoyono urged all nations to continue protecting their marine natural heritage by preventing commercial exploitation of their coastal and ocean environments.","token_len":501,"entropy":[1.7422,5.2169,0.0049,1.4746,5.7272,0.2916,7.6537,4.9349,13.7008,3.7647,3.5905,0.001,0.2053,6.0905,0.1005,0.6,11.8544,0.8457,9.9802,0.1889,6.3259,7.8244,0.9988,3.6412,2.3451,3.6509,1.9644,0.0039,0.0033,0.0001,3.9555,11.1964,14.1029,2.1378,2.8517,7.4422,4.405,4.5236,8.103,2.6863,5.5804,4.7731,1.0146,1.0398,0.0055,4.0955,0.0013,0.2057,4.5999,2.9056,2.0066,1.2769,1.7336,3.9451,4.2192,3.2776,5.2581,3.6248,2.2957,0.3503,1.3655,0.7674,0.902,0.0002,2.6292,3.283,0.5574,3.2847,4.1964,5.1213,5.2283,0.2202,0.6716,3.2755,0.0247,4.1076,5.1444,4.3429,0.6999,5.2704,0.9797,5.1453,4.8246,0.0279,0.3419,5.296,2.1916,1.4791,0.1164,2.6684,1.7039,5.3246,0.6911,4.638,0.5807,4.2628,0.4513,0.0002,3.6138,1.0572,2.8172,0.8895,1.9324,0.0064,7.3146,4.8508,2.9767,0.9235,2.7022,4.1349,2.7452,1.1218,4.1126,3.4823,1.2146,0.0057,4.3984,0.0049,2.02,5.1785,0.5878,4.1164,0.349,0.5038,0.228,0.0002,4.787,0.0208,3.0219,0.0101,6.1811,0.0046,2.4813,2.9362,0.1987,0.0623,0.303,2.3638,4.8398,0.2633,1.0942,6.2098,2.0843,0.01,0.5633,0.0035,0.0005,0.0979,6.0823,3.166,1.789,0.6839,3.246,3.3345,5.7286,1.1154,1.7531,0.4154,0.0002,2.0435,1.3963,0.0026,1.9766,1.0786,3.3392,4.452,6.2533,1.2265,0.5151,1.1371,0.0012,0.6709,1.535,1.7395,0.01,2.7427,0.6142,1.1358,3.019,0.092,1.342,4.3804,2.1421,3.9053,0.3896,0.197,4.5051,4.3914,0.7435,0.9244,0.1442,0.0001,1.4691,3.8574,1.8792,0.0474,0.5898,1.2434,0.0035,0.976,3.819,1.1949,0.5442,0.6265,0.0005,2.1265,5.5041,1.3129,2.4917,0.7613,1.8804,1.9797,1.0999,0.5639,1.2711,0.0063,0.263,5.5434,4.7856,0.3701,0.2746,0.1568,0.0002,1.9763,1.2901,2.7591,0.003,2.3449,2.8142,2.3801,3.7867,1.1585,0.2215,0.0002,0.1934,4.4008,4.0256,1.6763,0.5659,0.0812,0.2785,0.0073,2.4347,3.1103,1.0671,5.2814,0.0088,3.6589,0.5266,0.4521,0.6022,0.0005,0.1888,1.9404,0.9668,0.6951,0.7169,2.216,2.7198,0.4491,1.3754,0.0021,0.143,0.1395,0.0002,2.5605,0.8081,4.4093,0.9146,0.0001,2.7394,3.1799,4.9498,0.1064,0.5421,0.9442,0.0009,0.136,0.2932,0.857,8.8761,3.479,0.0064,3.0107,4.7852,4.6832,0.1127,0.6773,0.0127,0.5567,0.5232,4.6673,5.9034,0.6748,1.7876,1.3879,4.943,0.8747,1.0749,1.1275,0.1264,0.6432,0.0034,0.8881,0.2729,0.0002,4.7705,0.6872,4.0081,5.17,0.2692,2.0361,3.8962,3.2676,0.0002,0.3078,0.0663,0.5347,0.0065,2.8614,2.3327,0.3757,0.0002,1.6389,4.2108,4.0088,2.915,2.4279,1.4956,4.0465,3.6794,2.9897,0.5657,3.6542,1.0,6.0961,0.3641,1.4908,6.0855,0.8321,5.3213,0.2627,0.0513,0.4533,0.3345,0.2538,0.0002,3.4192,0.0133,1.5164,2.4193,0.272,0.005,4.8553,1.6174,0.6288,0.8844,1.7493,2.6576,1.7676,2.3467,0.0077,4.346,0.0077,1.5066,1.3084,4.3259,2.5859,6.9272,1.5859,3.031,1.6382,1.4639,0.2664,0.0002,1.0596,1.783,1.0508,0.0005,1.6077,2.6674,4.9241,4.8738,5.6466,2.4473,0.4787,4.4309,1.4449,3.4813,0.952,4.2766,0.3136,0.9257,1.0744,1.2473,0.2848,0.1583,2.3392,4.4714,5.1451,6.2163,4.0475,4.4831,1.5539,1.6272,2.0475,0.1947,1.4755,4.1769,1.461,0.3298,3.0212,0.0256,1.0917,0.411,1.2603,0.5807,0.4965,0.3823,0.2381,0.0001,0.0584,0.2759,0.0002,2.8649,2.2206,4.0495,0.0155,2.2621,1.024,4.0438,6.0995,2.2727,1.5874,2.0828,2.5209,3.1921,0.8825,0.0011,1.4131,3.3618,2.2675,1.6061,2.9176,3.5494,1.7338,2.9378,3.1846,0.4548,3.3944,1.0413,2.8507,4.0072,2.3552,5.4127,0.0193,5.687,0.0243,0.7621,2.8287,0.1726,1.7208,0.0014,2.0459,0.0302,0.1158,0.2901,0.3012,0.0002,5.0972,0.8724,0.5257,7.0541,5.1564,4.0062,0.0015,0.0066,0.0023,0.0,5.5873,3.3264,5.2484,0.2738,4.9734,5.8056,1.1529,4.1612,5.6718,2.107,3.5981,3.1169,1.5647,1.3699,0.6483,2.26,5.1139,2.1903,3.8648,2.0079,0.1573]}
{"id":2311,"ended":true,"length":398,"gen_text":"Until 1838 Keswick had no Anglican church within the town boundaries and was part of the widespread parish of Crosthwaite. The present parish church, St John's, was designed by Anthony Salvin and opened in October 1842. It was rebuilt in 1851 and is now one of five surviving traditional church buildings south of the River Tweed.\n\nThe area that now forms the town proper is now called Crosthwaite Ward.\n\nHistory\n\nThere are no early records of the settlement of Keswick. The earliest written evidence of settlement in this area concerns a survey of land between Northfield and Keswick in Northamptonshire. On 11 December 1751 the Surveyor of Scotland, William Jones, surveyed a large area in Northamptonshire which was the location of a number of farming plots: Keswick. As a result more than 80 land grants have been recorded between Northfield and this area, including several large holdings south of Keswick. Evidence of Keswick settlement can be seen on church records of Keswick. Evidence also has been found of settlement from about 1480.\n\nIn 1750 Keswick was the site of a number of small religious houses. These were later amalgamated to form the Keswick Church in 1752 when Keswick was incorporated into the Keswick Parish Church, one of the earliest parochial parishes (the other parish churches being Crosthwaite, St John's and Crosthwaite Ward).\n\nKeswick Parish Church today\n\nThe church of Keswick Parish Church remains at the present church site. It was opened in 1752, when Keswick was incorporated into the Keswick Parish Church. During the 1780s the church was used as the parish church for Keswick, and in 1802 this part of the church was re-christened Keswick Parish Church.\n\nKeswick Community Day\n\nIn the 1950s the parish church was damaged by fire. An act of the Keswick Parish Council was passed giving it back to the parish and re-building it at the site. The church is now used for community meetings. Other community activities are held at the site of the parish hall at Northfield.\n\nBibliography\n\nHirst, Anne. Northamptonshire: Village, Country, Churchland. Hampshire, 1981.

{"id":1550,"ended":true,"length":442,"gen_text":"From the 12th century onwards, large mansions lined the Strand including several palaces and townhouses inhabited by bishops and royal courtiers, mainly located on the south side, with their own river gates and gardens. The Royal Hospital for Women in Maryon Street (later Maryon Yard) was built in 1580, and later also the Royal Chapel for Women, Maryon Square. The latter two houses are today used as offices, while the former has become home to the National Trust for Scotland and is the only example of this type of house on the Strand where windows are still used. The house has a significant history for many reasons, being one of the first houses in the north of Scotland to be developed and occupied for residential purposes. The first recorded tenant of the house was Andrew Alexander the Elder, a wealthy landowner from Kirkwall, who was a patron of the Presbyterian Church in the 17th century. One of his daughters, Mary, married a member of the Privy Council and later became the wife of James Stewart, a well-known member of the King's household who became the Earl of Bannockburn. Mary Stewart lived in the house for a spell, moving to the country on James' death in 1609, however, when her husband died in 1613, Mary was made his successor, and the house continued to be occupied until 1638, when the Scots Civil Wars began.\n\nThe house is now owned by the National Trust for Scotland, established by the Scottish Parliament in 1841, and today the museum is one of two main buildings on the Strand as well as the Museum of Northern Scotland. The Strand now has a large number of visitors including tourists, the very active market, the visitor centre and a large number of cultural attractions. In February 2016, the Scottish Parliament announced a \u00a3400 million investment in a cycle scheme which will see a number of cycle lanes located along the Strand, including the new bridge over George Scott.\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nFurther reading [ edit ]\n\nKerry MacLeod, Maryon House, Dublin, 1992.\n\nMaryon House, Dublin, 1992.

{"id":1511,"ended":true,"length":491,"gen_text":"Regarding his looks in the film, Ram Charan said, `` Personality wise there isn \u2019 t really much difference to Kalabhairava but I have to tell you minor changes like the shape of your eyes and the size of your chin \u2019 are on purpose. I have worked for ten years on this film and have been lucky to have been able to keep the actor in check while he was playing the role but once he took over, he really began to do some amazing things so I had to make sure to see this in person and on screen. I have put so much time and energy into this film so it was important to have him see it through with the actor in order for it to look and sound real. I knew that for any actor to feel completely accepted with a role they must complete that role 100% or you will burn yourself out. I know that can be a tough ask with a film like this where the director is trying to create an entirely new character from scratch and the actor must give up some real part of themselves in order to bring about the desired result but once you give some of yourself you won't go back. It is the difference in this case as I have to feel confident and comfortable in a set of clothing that I had never worn in my life but having an actor like Balaji who is very open and real with all issues of his own will see this right through. He may not know much about acting or what it is all about but he is so full of life that every problem is forgotten the second it has got in his way. He can carry a line with ease and can really speak his mind without it coming across as annoying and he is just so genuine that it makes it all worthwhile. I have only seen the film once and will continue to work on it and this I feel is an important part of a film. It may not have been the easiest decision I have made but I do think it shows the commitment that you can have to make a movie for this type of audience. I want to thank each and every one of you who have supported this film, it may not have been good for the bottom line but we have had a great time making it. We look forward to seeing each and every one of you next time you have a screening with us. Thank you.\"\n\nThe film was produced by Niharika Vaidya and has received critical acclaim and has been hailed for its artistic mastery yet has failed to garner mainstream commercial appeal.","token_len":503,"entropy":[4.4066,9.6902,4.6166,1.1125,3.9188,0.2191,7.8161,8.8455,0.0088,1.9655,0.7397,7.3521,14.2546,1.3318,5.107,3.7857,15.5603,10.6305,7.5565,4.721,1.6897,1.2047,4.7198,9.761,4.8024,2.6731,0.042,4.6406,2.1708,2.4498,1.5567,3.9782,0.1339,14.2654,3.8535,3.3723,2.1886,4.3776,0.0548,6.9049,1.8242,1.4426,1.1847,3.0819,0.0437,0.1115,4.8721,4.3937,0.1219,2.1773,5.8367,1.8685,0.5688,1.6415,2.0878,4.409,3.5902,5.5009,0.1399,0.8884,1.5764,0.6959,0.6602,3.1196,2.5806,5.1245,1.0538,1.3321,2.173,1.1582,0.008,4.185,1.6125,4.4036,2.2433,2.4723,4.1343,2.9698,1.0533,3.59,1.2426,0.6206,4.7582,4.6596,1.1145,3.7561,1.3693,2.1074,1.4415,3.8449,4.4742,0.2603,4.1383,2.6003,2.3021,0.479,4.702,0.9021,2.0298,0.0847,3.1514,1.9267,2.9007,5.8009,4.6705,2.6182,3.0952,2.4033,5.2486,2.0932,0.6374,1.6519,1.959,5.5871,3.9714,0.0558,1.8257,0.5652,2.0401,0.1703,0.9639,0.429,2.7379,2.0437,1.1304,1.7366,0.8163,2.8773,1.4169,4.8945,1.0577,3.0983,4.4188,2.1843,4.6782,1.9236,4.4019,1.2722,2.1958,0.0317,3.1474,2.4405,1.2999,4.1973,0.391,1.5836,5.1012,1.334,4.983,4.3268,1.0218,0.8671,5.5899,4.0314,4.525,4.4372,2.5294,1.7077,2.6793,2.1136,6.2666,3.2811,0.3061,2.4085,0.8099,4.6254,3.6274,1.2968,6.2107,1.3957,0.0616,0.8356,1.5794,3.1911,1.3163,5.7637,0.4542,1.4814,2.573,3.1794,4.2827,1.5038,2.5282,1.1215,0.3094,4.2121,1.7327,3.0253,1.3856,2.8626,0.1237,2.9234,1.803,3.3515,0.2501,1.479,3.4473,0.1424,1.7396,2.7043,0.6908,2.2854,4.3878,3.7859,2.9012,4.7958,5.111,0.077,0.4366,1.9995,0.1081,0.4864,3.3207,4.0428,1.0742,1.9985,1.9675,2.5539,3.8474,1.5549,3.1145,6.45,1.3437,0.3831,2.3969,5.4928,0.0843,3.7554,0.2074,0.5947,2.6978,1.2378,2.8359,4.6353,3.617,4.1593,1.3758,3.9965,2.2091,1.8324,3.0892,5.5626,4.7684,1.9505,1.5033,1.5312,3.8599,6.4516,1.0294,3.7335,0.7572,1.7396,3.6754,1.3136,0.2432,2.9288,0.2861,0.1886,3.0178,5.5066,3.9443,0.2701,2.0656,5.3591,1.5729,2.8061,1.2751,3.1191,3.4256,0.8674,4.669,1.4734,3.9545,7.8242,2.6359,1.2963,1.7679,3.3916,5.1999,2.4738,5.677,0.7013,1.0411,2.1644,5.4261,0.9713,2.7822,2.8352,0.0794,3.9165,2.233,3.0265,1.3685,1.0916,2.2709,0.0061,0.307,0.7455,1.6643,3.1519,4.5231,0.0254,1.0268,2.1236,5.5205,4.873,1.8966,5.6256,3.7141,1.575,1.8858,3.4678,6.5094,3.4736,1.4792,0.2467,0.5019,1.7501,4.1501,4.6139,1.1869,4.6663,2.1405,1.7901,0.5548,3.2797,3.4614,5.169,1.1725,0.1806,2.3173,3.6887,2.4605,0.1197,0.1634,3.9493,2.778,1.8565,1.2254,2.8595,1.2066,3.4962,1.5734,1.7746,2.1426,2.1086,1.2389,0.9777,0.3977,1.4719,1.9615,5.0639,1.7746,2.2586,0.6335,0.995,1.2938,3.1619,3.9162,0.0896,1.7144,1.1627,0.4961,2.2921,5.0348,5.8634,3.0282,1.0068,3.7564,1.3906,1.1995,0.1402,3.6427,1.1161,1.854,2.1669,4.3412,0.9415,2.575,1.5359,1.4338,3.5736,5.7474,2.5902,0.2067,1.2921,0.7835,0.9413,4.4847,2.2929,0.7583,5.7381,1.7452,3.4808,1.6056,3.2669,2.5838,0.8719,1.5783,2.6449,0.5808,2.9153,4.4247,3.9402,2.8938,0.0067,0.6837,0.8051,1.2451,3.9127,0.5848,0.7839,5.0901,0.206,0.1519,0.4696,0.0446,0.5726,1.2688,0.773,1.2431,1.4682,0.5645,3.2387,2.2005,4.9077,0.4102,0.4879,0.5774,6.6198,2.0647,1.5818,3.474,0.0089,0.3169,4.2747,1.5935,2.2941,1.1965,1.2734,0.3624,1.1964,0.5887,1.8378,2.5399,4.0027,0.0282,0.0084,1.1115,4.6459,0.8015,0.2006,0.1312,0.0506,0.0321,2.87,0.6731,2.8897,3.3311,1.1914,3.1944,4.1457,0.4409,1.0468,2.2942,0.0916,2.6337,0.823,0.0502,2.2068,1.061,2.2499,3.0288,0.2258,4.5256,4.1085,0.4473,3.3095,1.4673,1.1995,0.9416,4.8576,2.8345,2.5283,0.0456,1.9439,1.7468,1.0708,3.1913,3.0406,0.3873,4.8506,5.0097,7.9558,2.9398,3.6706,0.0151,2.5622,4.4758,3.5177,1.2099,0.3416]}
{"id":2710,"ended":true,"length":444,"gen_text":"Despite the navigation being closed, a guide to Midhurst published in 1895 advertised that skiffs could be hired, and fishing could be enjoyed. The boats were hired out by a plumber called James Settle, who in the year 1892 was appointed Captain of the Midhurst Fisherman's Company, and he would continue to run the boat to the end of the 19th century.\nAfter the First World War, the company was forced to close due to competition from the newly formed National Union of Fisherman's Squires, and the site was handed over to the Thames Estuary Environment Centre, whose aim it was to provide services for the residents of the area, which included hosting fishing and water sports events; a pub on Leith Walk ; boat tours. In 1968, the river was closed to boats for one year to allow the regeneration of the riverbank.\nA former guide book published by the Thames Estuary Environment Centre (TEE CCU) during the 1970s showing the history of the Thames Estuary, and describing the activities at Leith Walk\nNowadays, the site is owned by the RMS Osprey Trust, and used for educational purposes by the Thames Estuary Ecology Centre (TEEC), who open the site up to the public from April until October. Visitors can see where the old boats were pulled out of the river: The Thames Estuary Boat Shop (open daily from 09.00-19.00) is across the street from the TEE CCU, and offers tours of the ships at Leith Walk. A private hire of two boats is also available.\nThe TEE CCU were able to get permission to excavate the boats when the site was owned by the RMS Osprey Trust, but had to turn around after their excavation had been completed. The TEE CCU have recently found the original wooden planks in the mud that have allowed them to begin planning where to find the original boat keelings.\nI have always been a sucker for history; the history of the river where the Osprey was once moored, and of the life of the men who worked alongside the Osprey, their families, and the village at which they lived. I have decided to create a blog and blog about the Osprey's history in Leith, and what else I found at Leith. If you have any further questions or comments, please write below, or join a virtual meeting with me and fellow bloggers.","token_len":503,"entropy":[1.2016,12.1656,4.9662,6.8108,0.8824,3.4312,6.5764,2.8699,8.8284,7.0097,8.0743,1.2636,5.6102,8.243,2.7806,9.2783,4.2712,1.203,0.5043,0.9033,3.3845,1.0895,7.1775,2.9773,0.463,3.7471,2.3594,2.1129,6.709,0.8259,7.7671,2.5273,1.7296,2.4528,8.3881,0.1422,2.4738,3.4152,5.4469,4.1827,0.7717,0.5269,4.6897,2.5847,5.043,2.2977,2.0789,2.4493,4.6969,3.8308,0.2487,0.2752,2.6014,0.008,5.2898,2.7061,0.311,2.2509,1.629,1.1682,3.3898,4.0061,3.7985,0.2695,1.6726,0.4719,2.748,4.3574,1.5006,1.7767,0.0874,1.4939,2.7178,0.0104,0.1537,0.1773,0.8243,9.3263,0.8751,3.6274,0.0123,0.0033,0.4066,0.8837,3.2686,1.1261,5.529,0.1952,0.605,2.6524,0.0071,4.2363,0.4405,1.5177,4.7551,1.5348,3.5786,4.3262,0.2802,1.4286,3.4567,0.4196,5.4781,1.0659,1.1361,1.1094,1.3858,4.4954,0.7062,4.1186,0.4448,0.0265,0.39,5.0962,2.2994,0.0035,4.8807,2.1633,1.7331,3.9908,2.438,2.8841,0.5894,0.0293,3.9866,5.2314,1.2861,0.5261,5.2163,0.398,0.739,1.6844,1.93,3.9725,0.8554,5.9284,2.8275,2.3825,3.3892,0.5381,0.6555,6.4339,3.1039,4.3143,4.5308,7.0336,1.2823,0.1872,7.4059,6.4758,1.6766,5.5909,2.8042,4.4838,0.6517,0.5717,3.9431,0.8074,2.1206,1.1497,2.6494,2.1568,4.002,0.8831,2.0815,0.8018,1.1131,4.899,0.1129,0.2845,1.597,2.0136,0.9495,1.0197,3.4555,5.8989,3.9544,2.114,3.1016,1.5599,0.4913,1.4267,0.0124,0.0014,0.2195,0.0084,2.9813,2.2155,0.5393,6.9673,5.7061,0.3279,5.4192,0.2525,1.685,0.1905,4.1749,0.8638,5.6801,0.0926,0.2933,4.163,0.2377,0.0007,2.5298,1.9205,5.1956,0.4963,4.2802,2.7254,3.2486,0.0074,0.0625,2.9854,5.7327,1.0257,0.5541,0.939,2.5593,0.4686,3.5637,0.0679,0.6208,4.6511,3.7396,4.6673,0.387,0.0024,1.8932,0.7361,1.2961,4.9923,1.0664,3.8884,0.9934,2.8348,0.6491,2.058,0.0265,0.0016,2.5917,1.059,1.4145,0.3483,0.035,1.0704,2.5816,6.0976,0.8488,1.4673,1.9524,0.5092,0.2597,0.0357,3.8835,2.3293,2.9574,1.1455,0.7985,5.0916,0.7049,2.4394,4.8136,0.3647,4.375,1.2384,1.3813,4.4613,1.3924,0.8447,0.4336,0.9315,6.0366,4.5741,4.4441,0.2565,0.0027,2.5835,5.3095,3.1993,3.2058,2.716,1.4305,2.9826,1.4481,0.3072,0.9567,2.9318,0.0346,0.1289,0.8946,2.4294,5.2725,0.2474,2.1741,0.4732,0.2931,5.0758,0.0134,0.4003,0.0021,1.2286,0.7265,2.1444,3.0687,0.7033,0.1514,6.0094,4.5004,0.8782,0.0014,0.0346,1.4415,3.719,5.8966,4.7944,3.4651,4.2714,0.7036,0.975,1.1932,0.1742,1.2743,0.8014,1.5302,2.997,0.0084,0.1244,0.001,5.1903,3.0634,0.005,3.7035,1.131,0.7936,3.0274,0.0004,0.8289,2.8073,4.607,1.167,1.5138,0.1053,3.6355,0.0167,0.4943,1.5806,0.015,0.1848,0.002,0.001,0.0318,0.6184,1.6167,4.1921,0.1669,4.6439,2.8255,1.7816,4.1122,3.1077,2.8843,1.3985,1.1215,0.7537,1.4293,2.1934,0.0023,0.0895,0.0012,2.1254,4.0828,4.1211,2.0429,2.4856,2.5328,0.8098,0.001,3.713,0.4885,3.686,3.3542,4.3879,3.0904,0.2266,0.0186,3.4007,5.086,5.6461,1.2879,3.4653,0.3978,1.5753,3.2061,5.1075,0.6155,3.5113,0.7816,1.1619,4.4756,2.3428,3.6177,1.0081,2.5184,3.1921,0.0025,3.4014,4.2009,2.6055,3.2548,0.206,0.8882,2.3595,6.7615,1.8224,2.5399,0.0088,0.0432,1.9986,3.1145,1.8542,0.0,1.0015,0.7156,3.0488,0.5178,4.956,0.6661,0.4689,2.9397,0.445,2.6214,5.5135,1.3565,1.0048,0.001,0.0183,2.1842,4.6881,1.1966,1.0338,0.2862,0.9355,5.8707,4.6204,2.4968,0.5287,0.6117,0.3166,1.6532,1.9915,5.8875,0.2008,5.1227,0.3528,1.9986,4.0512,2.5324,1.4127,0.6204,1.9932,0.0026,0.0046,2.9977,1.3517,2.3073,2.3339,0.0006,3.0831,0.8179,3.7822,5.9529,1.1585,4.1575,2.628,1.2718,0.0007,2.4887,3.2163,0.1412,0.9683,0.2585,3.7439,2.4438,1.3398,0.9916,0.5626,0.587,4.9489,4.3879,2.1673,0.3212,4.3339,5.2997,5.6394,3.4494,2.4746,0.5266,1.667,3.3057,1.8316,2.3638]}
{"id":755,"ended":true,"length":442,"gen_text":"When Tintin in the Congo was first released by the series'Scandinavian publishers in 1975, they objected to page 56, where Tintin drills a hole into a live rhinoceros, fills it with gunpowder, sets it afire, throws it on the ground, and laughs his head off. In this section he makes the following pun:\n\n\"I have filled him with gunpowder, now he's done!\"\n\nand\n\n\"He's done!\"\n\nThe book thus ends with a man using gunpowder on a living creature and killing it, because that's just what happens when you make your head explode with gunpowder. This joke was intended to make us chuckle and the joke is also one that I would like to propose to the Norwegian government with a view to having them publish comic stories or cartoons about the Nazis. As a Norwegian comic writer I am a big fan of the Nazi SS, with the SS being my favorite theme and symbol in the Norwegian art and comics history.\n\nIn this part Tintin in the Congo also has to say a lot of things about his friends, as his relationship with Rubeus the Rhinoceros is really good. This comic is not about Tintin killing anyone, as it does not feature that ( there were no humans in the Congo at the time), but about him using gunpowder which causes the rhinoceros to explode on impact.\n\nAfter this part we get a comic where Tintin has to climb a tree and fight the lion. It makes perfect sense because if a rhinoceros is shot through the head with gunpowder, it will explode.\n\nThis comic is about tasers using electricity, using gunpowder, and using a rocket launcher using gunpowder.\n\nWe get another instance of Tintin talking about his toys, which is where we get a good laugh. I have never liked the word 'play' in the sense of shooting a dart at a toy for fun because it is not fun at all, but in this case playing shooting toys can cause kids to do bad things.\n\nThe final comic is Tintin fighting the snake, with a shot through the head at the end.\n\nTintin in the Congo is a very good comic. It also has an important message, which is about the danger of war. When you have war it is important to have a sense of humor, that has a good effect.","token_len":505,"entropy":[7.4016,6.5031,0.095,4.8259,1.8251,2.0692,2.5689,2.2114,2.9803,3.9576,2.1198,7.3574,0.4083,17.744,2.9817,0.0069,0.1008,2.8374,1.294,4.6007,0.1223,4.5783,8.2181,0.2385,10.4164,7.1246,0.9097,1.1557,1.5963,0.0006,0.0004,12.4355,1.0622,0.5437,1.6357,0.5456,6.2371,5.4444,1.6723,0.0007,0.0189,2.5722,8.2988,0.3482,0.1067,2.4543,0.0619,0.7477,3.7424,0.4674,1.8474,0.3275,0.6465,4.8842,0.9587,3.089,0.667,0.5256,0.5641,0.3711,3.8127,4.3292,1.454,0.0046,0.5857,3.3392,3.9176,4.5,3.8365,4.6392,2.0306,3.1427,6.4252,1.2369,1.4741,0.0037,1.4388,2.8493,3.0127,4.6082,4.1403,0.3756,0.1541,0.0172,1.3158,4.3791,1.272,1.2276,5.4265,2.978,0.2618,0.0001,5.2934,1.488,0.0002,0.0539,2.1842,0.2985,1.4742,1.6445,0.2013,0.0001,1.7434,3.8308,6.4869,3.9511,0.4146,1.1675,5.1341,5.4301,1.2872,0.0105,2.666,0.3872,2.0932,1.3448,2.8732,5.1529,0.1807,1.895,4.3879,2.4972,0.3907,1.8178,0.9094,3.6564,0.9983,0.2155,2.9843,5.1582,5.4452,0.22,1.5149,0.3081,0.0057,0.2712,3.6047,4.6971,1.4458,5.1188,0.3637,3.1531,3.6075,3.1616,2.746,3.8317,3.5221,2.1541,4.6888,3.9498,1.6244,3.9619,3.3124,2.3872,0.0956,5.9541,1.8334,1.5178,4.5236,2.15,5.7448,2.0283,3.1573,0.0474,3.0322,2.9686,3.9684,7.2482,5.3811,5.5308,1.7586,1.9578,1.6,5.196,1.3985,4.8432,1.8715,3.3702,3.8325,2.3909,1.3486,2.3404,3.6027,2.7338,0.2003,0.014,1.2584,3.1086,5.8211,1.335,5.273,1.9524,3.2656,0.96,2.616,1.1767,5.7468,2.6461,4.0883,0.9771,1.5862,2.4959,5.3979,1.654,3.812,4.3725,0.2235,1.5568,0.0002,2.8559,2.8076,5.1395,2.8038,0.0012,0.0006,5.1368,0.0255,0.0087,2.5407,2.5887,3.3465,5.1958,3.1246,1.7004,0.251,1.6104,2.0113,3.0591,4.4497,1.2864,4.1336,3.7147,5.4583,0.0607,5.3469,4.1124,0.1255,3.3875,1.6567,0.0095,0.0039,0.0285,0.5515,5.39,4.5628,1.0478,3.1888,5.1471,1.3642,3.7996,2.6836,1.8878,0.0006,0.001,4.0769,4.3346,0.6194,2.6735,2.5291,3.8677,0.2698,4.9485,3.1749,6.0325,10.6812,3.7142,2.1511,4.1381,0.6414,0.5883,1.2497,0.8778,1.0977,0.0519,2.7963,0.392,1.4426,2.1901,3.7953,3.1612,0.0067,6.8893,2.5728,1.9719,1.2956,1.2682,0.0009,0.0223,0.1351,1.0802,4.1905,3.0818,0.6798,1.6559,0.0002,4.6738,1.6826,2.3497,2.6889,1.7705,1.2155,3.9754,2.1104,0.5021,0.0009,0.0004,2.2319,0.3352,5.7865,0.9825,1.3133,1.4968,4.1575,2.3849,5.2763,1.7563,3.178,5.4373,4.1958,0.0196,4.2558,3.8224,2.9726,2.4845,0.8218,0.0006,0.042,1.9255,2.4999,5.1171,0.2147,0.7927,0.906,0.682,0.0048,0.886,0.6823,0.7352,0.6054,1.5189,1.5096,0.0002,2.5696,2.1448,1.19,2.6079,7.3737,5.3683,7.4403,2.6832,1.3803,5.4638,4.4334,0.025,1.6331,0.6655,1.4147,2.042,4.1709,1.2786,5.9335,0.8007,0.007,0.472,1.3428,0.0001,4.3798,1.5071,2.1648,6.508,0.2523,1.851,0.0012,0.0009,4.7843,0.385,1.2248,6.293,1.1913,2.761,1.2833,3.8519,1.9061,0.6798,2.915,2.6017,2.9096,1.2812,3.717,2.5103,3.3125,3.9582,1.2852,3.7698,2.5751,3.9035,0.7989,1.3804,1.5007,2.4294,0.4177,4.9971,1.9829,5.3089,1.1338,0.5498,2.5583,5.2495,0.9346,4.8071,1.3069,1.6787,1.825,1.2869,1.633,0.0047,1.4218,1.246,1.9504,0.9568,1.0419,5.1279,7.1894,4.1536,5.0292,3.9318,6.0497,0.2404,3.4488,3.7948,0.0536,0.7663,0.9515,0.0002,2.3813,2.9939,2.0168,1.0392,3.1763,0.0015,0.0008,3.238,1.1804,4.8188,1.8501,3.8577,1.5449,4.8304,2.8675,0.5001,0.3755,5.2427,0.3303,0.2877,0.6329,1.5126,0.0001,3.1569,0.0696,0.0018,0.9168,0.0348,0.0148,1.026,1.1919,2.2543,1.0851,1.0937,2.5183,0.9477,4.6886,1.4697,3.3454,3.0914,0.6742,1.8204,1.1469,0.4265,2.8941,1.2802,3.3189,0.1568,4.6684,1.448,4.3692,1.8308,2.4893,3.0982,3.9579,0.7586,3.0089,0.3179,2.521,1.2064,3.5897,0.0293,0.9934,1.5169,5.0421,5.7179,2.5184,2.5828,2.9129,1.8862]}

He was then shocked and angry when they returned and then left.\"\n\nMr Justice Sweeney added: \"When police arrived two days later, he asked them if they had done anything. They replied that they had done nothing because they were 'foggy'.\"\n\nHe went on: \"It is clear from what Mr Churchman has said that his reason for reporting his concern was a genuine worry which at the time was unfounded.\"\n\nHe added: \"It is extremely challenging for police officers to investigate this type of case involving such a sensitive subject. They must take the view that the evidence is not entirely reliable and may even be unreliable given that he is an extremely private person.\n\n\"In any reasonable case, it would be reasonable for him to expect that something of this nature would be properly investigated and any suspicions or suspicions should be put to rest as fast as possible.\"\n\nIn a statement released after the ruling, Mr Churchman said: \"I am delighted with the decision of the Appeal Court and will now continue to focus on my recovery.\"","token_len":506,"entropy":[6.3726,2.2334,4.1812,1.2134,4.6277,7.4434,2.2664,1.1145,3.8444,1.8673,2.8259,1.2883,8.0948,3.3018,0.4152,3.2974,0.1222,0.4308,2.8965,5.1951,0.3593,3.5945,0.1169,0.5373,4.7713,6.7863,0.4429,0.7707,10.8944,8.8132,7.8215,0.3997,1.4969,4.5861,1.0236,2.1794,2.4178,4.1323,1.2483,1.8002,4.1961,1.4214,5.6471,1.9789,0.4535,2.4938,1.3705,4.3702,1.1653,1.5826,5.4517,1.7168,4.7564,0.1393,2.9113,1.9167,4.3826,0.0399,0.8764,2.8735,2.3981,2.2523,3.6922,0.3525,0.6939,5.3514,0.9075,0.6554,0.0012,2.2293,1.8224,0.3438,0.0507,2.431,0.8521,3.9699,0.4159,3.3571,2.1899,0.1097,1.7522,1.4989,4.2253,0.5397,0.0327,1.4789,6.0796,0.9666,0.5022,0.06,0.8857,1.9981,0.0002,0.0736,2.4244,2.043,1.011,1.7904,1.8264,0.971,0.7491,5.4129,1.0429,0.0004,1.5006,0.5068,3.5291,0.0629,5.7673,0.1318,0.7993,1.3693,0.4577,1.1646,0.6468,2.4889,3.7571,0.7415,5.4458,3.6959,0.0458,0.1776,0.3594,0.2863,1.8072,0.783,2.3133,2.2322,0.159,0.0196,0.712,1.5072,2.1281,0.6101,1.2081,2.951,4.999,4.3012,2.615,0.0014,0.4755,0.5293,1.0725,0.2343,0.0002,0.0987,1.451,1.1358,4.5567,2.4021,0.3119,6.581,1.5956,2.3011,7.8363,6.0359,3.0913,3.3525,0.007,2.4673,2.8499,3.8902,5.8696,3.8286,0.8219,1.8657,6.1272,1.8228,2.7422,1.0862,0.8825,2.3869,0.7269,0.9934,2.6151,3.1812,4.2003,0.4445,7.7945,1.4357,0.9733,5.6415,2.5558,1.5514,3.1598,1.1508,0.9883,4.4888,2.3194,3.1117,5.2194,0.8641,5.2647,0.2419,0.1639,2.3156,0.3788,0.246,1.1433,0.5562,0.0003,2.8198,4.1011,2.6013,2.0584,5.8307,1.7413,2.7009,3.8401,3.704,0.1697,0.4645,0.3903,0.2705,1.2587,0.0068,1.5143,3.1178,5.5437,1.1871,4.1184,4.6658,0.3184,3.3709,0.4777,1.7758,6.0181,0.9588,3.4774,0.0407,1.6299,4.8386,2.2143,0.0009,0.2426,4.1864,0.4361,3.726,0.125,0.0984,0.2028,2.6376,2.2016,5.5552,0.0043,0.4822,5.3333,0.7156,4.7512,0.1201,3.0495,1.9116,0.2573,0.3346,0.0003,0.058,0.6889,2.9098,0.7907,2.4278,1.6642,1.9201,0.6094,3.6122,0.425,4.1026,2.3074,1.2787,2.1346,2.8757,1.1329,0.1152,5.0732,0.642,0.5278,1.1329,1.1556,1.186,0.0002,0.0409,5.4576,3.0172,0.0264,1.3604,4.6964,1.4515,2.3689,3.0127,0.1757,0.0721,1.7917,0.9397,2.7239,3.024,4.5985,2.3764,4.4458,1.2687,2.0751,2.0753,1.5342,5.0029,3.8473,2.3124,0.1683,0.0002,1.9707,0.5001,0.0062,1.4319,0.3716,0.0061,4.0,3.9105,1.4545,5.3696,0.7229,0.0837,0.7889,2.2624,5.5545,0.7955,1.8233,0.701,0.7042,4.8915,0.3892,2.3417,1.0725,2.4552,0.3842,0.1991,0.2331,4.4174,0.1218,3.4381,0.9999,1.6718,2.8894,3.8882,5.6929,0.2921,2.6809,0.1677,0.0002,2.2337,3.9061,0.008,0.3071,0.0059,2.9571,0.9771,1.078,1.2462,3.4083,3.3966,0.5642,0.0014,1.0279,1.1684,0.4383,3.191,5.49,0.0305,2.5511,3.1443,3.1334,0.7701,3.6319,2.3056,4.7939,4.7377,4.8111,0.6943,0.0869,1.501,2.6544,1.6795,0.2378,0.0002,2.5461,0.9104,0.3319,0.0053,2.1102,0.5018,5.6181,6.0909,0.7257,1.3532,1.5366,0.6687,2.2182,3.1826,0.7245,0.0037,1.5562,4.802,3.179,0.5506,2.4778,2.5074,1.0773,3.699,1.7782,4.1847,2.7425,2.334,0.0793,2.1693,3.8149,1.284,1.607,6.2161,1.0956,0.9939,3.8843,4.4909,0.4042,2.7846,5.5238,2.1836,3.1215,2.2507,3.9075,3.4127,0.8672,1.0951,1.1743,0.2005,0.0002,0.0335,2.8153,4.1283,7.4899,1.1928,0.7151,2.1039,1.1933,0.5317,3.7346,0.6868,2.4175,0.0608,2.8741,0.5021,6.2797,2.4166,0.725,0.4523,0.3121,1.0104,5.1806,0.1219,1.6414,4.7383,2.9991,3.2553,1.2634,2.5003,0.0829,4.3714,0.0821,0.26,3.2936,5.6667,0.0197,0.1659,0.5576,0.3337,0.0002,3.109,1.1095,0.3172,2.8484,1.327,0.1965,2.4944,0.096,0.9873,0.1557,0.0178,0.5198,0.2829,0.0034,0.772,1.1732,2.7629,1.1068,0.2679,1.5429,1.1487,0.0826,5.4757,0.0309,1.9464,4.1517,1.1209,2.8357,0.58,2.0553,0.3604,0.8903,1.0073,1.7792]}
{"id":2156,"ended":true,"length":487,"gen_text":"The surface temperature of a main sequence star is determined by the rate of energy production of its core and by its radius, and is often estimated from the star's color index. Other stars can be classified in the way similar objects are classified (for example by their size), so if you want to learn more about classifications and the way these are created, check out the Wikipedia page on classification. Here is an easy way to make this simple.\n\nHow does heat and light get to a main sequence star? The most obvious process for this is through the process of convection, which is the heating of a super-compound gas with the interaction of its constituent particles with the surrounding gases; for example, when a gas has a temperature. If a star is the right density, it may have a temperature of, which is a large number compared to its radius, so it will have a large convective force (as its radius increases, its temperature decreases, and vice versa). We will go into more detail there. We can derive the temperature equation for a star from its parameters by the method of partial differential equations. This is the method I recommended in the article on the origin of the mass-to-size relationship.\n\nLet be the amount of energy produced by the star's core, where is the radius of the core, and is the radius (the radius at the start of the star is determined by, where r is the distance the core is from the center of the star). Then we can write the energy balance equation as:, and that gives as, where is the heat that flows from the star to its surroundings. Substituting these answers into our equation for the mass per unit volume, then gives us the relation:\n\nSo, so in effect we expect the star to have at least. That is, the star is a thermonuclear explosion!\n\nIn this case, where we substitute in for, then gives us the temperature at which the star could have started cooling; the temperature is just the temperature of the center plus the temperature of the gas around the center (remember that we could be using a different radius; here, it is irrelevant). To see how this fits with the initial conditions of the formation scenario, see the section on starting stars.\n\nWhen you're done reading about the formation of stars, check out the section on star formation. If you want to see the details of a real explosion, we will cover the explosive process in the section on detonation.","token_len":507,"entropy":[8.3663,3.789,0.7616,4.1494,8.7966,3.1358,1.0263,1.1774,2.8725,0.2004,0.631,4.1124,0.6906,3.2569,2.9545,3.0399,1.634,0.5126,1.7946,1.4748,2.0652,4.0883,1.7533,2.2149,2.189,3.9885,4.6249,1.6641,0.9819,4.6132,0.0236,3.8123,8.1117,0.8013,5.6547,3.1817,2.6496,0.5825,2.6739,2.7477,2.2124,5.6397,7.165,2.1568,0.6836,0.7495,4.0504,2.6582,0.1677,3.7095,0.8259,4.2728,2.2086,3.3991,4.9312,1.7557,2.1343,0.1211,2.8729,0.2894,0.1328,4.8106,0.7884,2.9119,2.8197,3.9312,3.3422,0.8717,4.8853,0.2805,1.4357,0.0516,1.3252,2.1729,1.4408,0.3735,1.8073,0.5433,5.2194,1.9518,1.8792,4.8812,0.7537,0.0569,4.183,4.1341,3.7616,2.6033,1.0533,0.0031,4.374,2.9977,5.7518,4.4004,0.8576,1.9165,1.5489,1.1579,2.3343,0.0412,0.0166,0.1313,2.6594,3.3136,2.4609,4.6885,3.1212,1.7868,0.1999,2.4475,1.1588,3.5553,0.1569,1.3374,0.0087,1.0503,1.1131,0.8584,1.4539,2.5021,0.3191,0.9617,5.8271,1.3076,6.5198,1.7818,1.4882,3.9206,1.5833,5.6686,0.0596,1.2517,1.8149,1.7659,3.303,0.9708,0.8559,5.4816,5.5305,3.523,0.608,0.1332,2.3877,1.4384,1.3506,4.0092,0.9719,0.9854,7.3206,3.591,2.2921,1.1926,1.0077,4.9941,2.3379,5.3468,0.9533,1.7632,4.3523,2.4385,0.9922,2.0685,0.7928,4.1399,9.4672,0.4009,2.3891,5.1365,0.2986,3.4654,0.0542,1.3288,2.0028,1.1108,1.7337,1.5221,1.4358,2.523,0.802,2.45,1.8107,0.6511,4.1919,3.4619,3.97,4.1,1.9966,1.3083,1.1679,1.519,1.0332,0.7537,2.4251,1.0914,0.2402,0.1428,0.2835,5.0515,2.7853,4.4262,0.6552,0.6517,0.2051,7.2121,0.515,4.6868,1.1671,5.9717,0.9506,1.7209,5.9798,0.8624,0.5209,0.5179,1.4429,1.3182,6.5268,3.0724,3.0557,3.5274,0.3825,3.829,0.0491,0.1089,1.0434,2.466,0.8889,2.0661,2.2222,3.3285,6.1759,0.6331,1.678,2.9365,1.2985,2.001,4.9882,0.0415,0.9899,2.8458,1.3347,3.2393,0.0023,3.8282,1.5939,0.9057,1.0028,0.0002,3.1117,5.359,0.3723,4.9704,0.0138,1.022,2.8791,0.5649,0.4905,1.1888,1.193,0.1674,1.0879,4.942,0.5513,0.2964,1.728,0.8075,0.0965,2.3104,0.3785,0.5927,0.3929,0.2793,3.0282,5.5514,2.6504,2.3952,4.6585,1.1636,5.4111,0.0728,0.156,0.7746,3.0033,6.0792,0.1578,7.4012,3.8584,5.026,0.3319,0.1447,2.8073,4.6647,1.8589,0.7397,0.1068,0.105,0.9032,0.5488,0.0553,0.0676,0.5784,1.6935,1.323,0.9987,1.3205,0.8793,3.2892,3.7532,0.0964,1.6289,9.2251,3.434,4.5431,2.2124,7.4479,3.2936,0.9386,0.9777,0.1483,3.4474,4.5327,4.7871,1.0954,0.0934,1.4737,0.884,0.94,0.2265,0.9547,5.8734,0.1289,0.0013,2.8693,6.23,0.6091,2.9228,1.2842,0.8082,0.6186,3.4537,7.4828,0.2788,0.7201,1.0815,5.5023,1.4011,0.823,0.9146,5.5665,1.7335,0.2311,0.0002,3.4351,1.1187,8.1477,5.5076,4.2437,1.7032,7.7995,1.1444,1.8017,0.2591,0.8978,5.6662,0.3407,4.8944,3.6763,0.8812,0.6028,1.4372,1.3066,1.7034,2.1309,3.7033,0.0689,0.0016,2.8717,3.3816,1.2561,0.0002,3.7774,2.6693,1.5351,0.3221,5.2525,2.8946,5.9355,1.8283,0.7473,4.7025,2.6402,2.3974,0.3081,0.8278,3.6513,2.435,1.5144,0.6044,0.6318,5.302,1.8594,1.943,5.6953,3.451,2.6105,1.7141,1.6223,3.9751,0.7797,2.1408,0.8898,0.2666,4.3071,5.1704,0.4539,1.5082,0.2533,0.1682,4.1065,1.852,0.9559,2.067,2.2949,3.9257,0.9702,3.3525,5.5648,3.7787,2.0486,1.5288,0.9584,2.7961,5.1793,4.7125,1.3465,3.1814,0.5145,5.7507,0.636,4.8686,3.0789,1.7374,0.7297,3.53,1.1407,0.5331,4.7635,2.793,1.5157,0.2819,4.5039,7.0893,0.2393,3.2782,0.5637,1.8815,0.313,6.1216,2.2519,0.5036,0.3918,0.0002,4.7728,2.9679,3.8758,0.8987,2.6818,2.8597,0.9698,1.7733,0.1702,0.378,0.2573,2.4048,0.0759,0.6891,1.5289,0.1288,3.3419,0.1212,0.9881,3.8215,0.1102,1.4318,0.3021,3.2878,2.0579,3.6945,0.267,3.3147,4.4751,5.4726,0.3256,5.2513,3.0558,3.8231,1.8264,5.8021,2.5487,0.954,0.758,1.2664,0.0691,3.8567,0.4551,0.5881]}

But he will only be president for 7 years, the time he is allowed to govern, and only after the term limit of 14 years, so he is not the \"most powerful rector in the history of the Brazilian university\".\u00a0\n(This post was recently linked on Reddit and many people say they are surprised to see this blog is about the rector of a university. I was. The only time this blog was covered anywhere was with regards to the last rector, Jos\u00e9 Carlos Varela. I did not think that anyone, including the main Brazilian publication, O Grupo de S\u00e3o Paulo (O S\u00e3o Paulo) could cover this blog without also mentioning the rector of the university. But my mistake. The day after I had read this blog I read that O Gr\u00f3gogo has a new rector. This is the latest thing I thought of.)","token_len":507,"entropy":[8.7852,4.7171,3.4391,7.2727,0.8671,0.4585,6.5687,2.4259,0.3874,6.4248,2.2631,6.1418,0.5248,0.0522,4.5903,1.5615,0.589,0.1895,5.0616,1.7481,5.6657,0.4601,0.283,4.1762,1.3902,4.1487,2.0064,3.8528,2.2019,1.7934,5.881,0.3992,0.307,10.165,0.0194,0.2964,0.5101,0.5863,0.0146,0.666,4.4976,0.1352,0.1798,1.0861,2.2449,1.8943,0.0677,0.1178,3.6634,0.145,1.6377,1.6024,5.7521,0.1434,2.3237,0.429,2.9149,1.0592,1.7803,4.6765,1.6399,5.8235,0.7759,5.3844,1.2316,0.0268,0.0007,0.0008,0.4951,0.9183,11.7859,4.4333,4.1883,1.8677,5.7227,1.9041,4.759,1.1013,0.0008,0.5353,0.0037,4.7429,4.5477,3.2397,3.8925,2.1646,5.1381,0.0167,0.9602,0.9918,0.0198,0.0084,4.9011,4.5449,5.3995,2.6326,1.1537,0.7722,5.2178,3.7101,0.7098,5.4006,1.3144,1.2595,2.8641,0.0319,0.9181,4.6861,0.0145,4.0116,0.8534,5.368,3.625,1.6458,0.0771,1.0896,3.3632,1.3055,3.6229,2.2242,1.7685,4.2538,2.4555,0.0123,0.2765,4.9303,3.1509,1.2629,1.1396,0.7732,0.0023,3.5058,1.9845,0.9014,1.1521,0.0413,1.0996,3.3114,0.2788,3.754,3.0608,1.0412,2.3964,1.0173,5.4125,3.835,0.7554,3.175,1.9511,0.1722,0.751,1.0248,3.6115,0.102,0.0494,1.3026,4.7973,2.1022,3.6016,0.0004,0.386,0.0047,6.264,5.1351,4.3414,0.2671,1.0367,0.3852,0.0189,0.0122,4.8439,4.9651,4.82,0.8179,5.4374,5.5114,2.4906,2.3464,4.7055,2.0004,1.2358,3.6956,5.0246,2.7148,2.0749,0.1007,1.0009,1.5614,0.1956,4.7503,1.5974,2.7693,0.1313,0.5967,0.0003,0.1803,0.0038,2.2035,0.0383,0.0009,0.0164,0.022,0.0092,0.001,0.0017,0.0012,0.0009,0.0015,0.3947,0.0295,0.0151,0.0126,0.007,0.1713,5.855,0.5569,2.3133,0.0666,0.2508,0.0003,0.0871,0.0024,0.6865,0.0016,0.0005,0.0009,0.0018,0.0024,0.001,0.0007,0.0009,0.0013,0.001,0.0678,0.0042,0.0012,0.0015,0.0026,0.1352,4.8762,4.0246,6.1265,4.3153,4.8161,1.5287,8.1575,0.2837,3.8039,0.8756,4.971,4.7751,3.0695,3.3834,1.5637,1.7206,0.0007,0.6943,3.2125,2.9934,0.2465,0.1319,4.7588,0.7161,0.1709,4.478,3.8146,0.1203,2.7657,0.587,0.6253,0.0003,0.232,0.0023,5.4909,1.0133,3.547,4.0076,5.623,0.023,0.9754,0.7863,0.0051,0.0193,4.8045,5.3826,0.5437,1.4968,0.368,0.1802,0.0002,0.0896,0.0022,0.5099,0.0014,0.0004,0.0006,0.0014,0.0021,0.0009,0.0006,0.0009,0.0013,0.0012,0.0306,0.0025,0.0008,0.0013,0.0014,5.7649,0.1496,4.2261,4.1651,0.1539,3.5141,0.1559,0.243,0.0063,0.0117,0.005,0.7716,1.8431,1.6881,0.0007,4.1973,1.8454,4.5245,6.3757,2.2456,1.0654,4.5206,2.0968,3.5156,4.1096,0.7786,4.7408,1.5457,5.3487,0.5492,1.0768,4.1223,3.7776,2.6198,2.5609,2.8188,0.3312,4.1377,3.5429,1.3523,3.7659,2.2441,1.1391,5.4438,2.6413,1.0607,5.5737,0.0679,2.6814,3.0961,1.2885,1.9336,1.2679,2.6777,3.5645,4.6573,1.4989,2.9623,0.0002,1.2546,0.9092,3.1823,0.0539,0.5068,3.5187,0.9661,1.0089,2.3563,0.2264,5.5739,3.6992,2.1277,0.9712,6.2997,5.3359,1.6129,3.0689,1.8451,5.3978,0.8925,4.9751,2.5999,1.8591,3.148,2.5209,0.7417,2.3712,4.5045,3.5766,2.2615,1.5417,0.4158,0.0191,1.5699,1.6169,1.4318,1.8724,1.4117,3.3418,5.271,3.6744,3.6994,3.4405,3.9877,0.6764,1.94,5.5366,3.8297,1.1856,4.8493,3.8783,0.0135,0.6581,6.5717,0.5639,0.0052,1.1248,4.4134,1.9646,3.9092,1.5153,0.0078,1.5156,2.0085,3.7101,0.4317,3.3018,2.4412,3.1645,4.7488,2.5938,1.1391,5.3312,3.17,5.5975,0.4505,4.1346,7.8649,0.013,2.561,3.3476,0.1912,0.0042,3.0444,2.0277,2.3842,0.018,0.0022,1.4747,1.9991,2.2103,1.6108,0.5679,2.904,4.6337,1.0657,1.1262,1.3704,0.0443,0.2646,0.6766,1.9648,1.2631,2.8592,5.7291,2.6855,1.339,2.7867,5.7422,0.7059,1.1075,4.5495,3.6539,0.8255,0.9778,1.7438,2.4259,2.14,1.9909,5.4747,2.5186,3.3143,6.6584,3.3804,3.1525,2.1193,1.9204,0.0004,1.5007,3.3214,1.7246,1.9749,5.8942,4.3497,1.393,5.7647,1.9448,2.2869]}

The actor said his mother, who had been raised a Hindu, converted to Islam on her marriage to Mohammad Akhtar Khan, with whom she lived.\n\nIn response to Khan's post on his Facebook page, Fernandez said: \"Is the truth in your eyes Pakistan? Are you against an Indian, can't change who your parents are and the history you were born with.

He is a small, red lizard who's been found on one of the last uninhabited islands in Australia.\n\nHe has no memory of living on the island but is nonetheless fascinated by it and soon becomes the caretaker of the island. He often uses it to travel to other locations using a radio transmitter to broadcast a radio call to his fellow explorers.\n\nHe meets Rube Goldberg, who is trying to build a machine to create earthquakes so he can discover the secrets of the island. O'Brien voices that he is very unhappy with Rube's plan, but decides to assist him anyway. The plan goes awry, with the earthquakes destroying the island.\n\nAfter their death, the Viscount is seen on the island's beach, watching the destruction and crying over the death of his people. The two briefly discuss how the island was created and Rube gets the island's name, \"Mudlark Cay\".\n\nTrivia\n\nHe, along with the other Legendary creatures, appears on the cover of the Australian comic \"Wacky Comics #9\", a parody of the movie Rock-a-Bye Baby.\n\n. Although the Viscount's name may be derived from the Greek word for \"lizard\", it is actually named after the same word used for the \"lions of ancient Assyria\", which is related to the word \"marsh\" (a place used to raise livestock).\n\nDespite being a lizard, the Viscount did not actually have any limbs or toes.\n\nIn the original screenplay, he is also seen in one of The Master's hologram videos, but the final film removed him from the final edited version, likely due to his larger size and lack of a personality.\n\nGallery","token_len":511,"entropy":[7.8659,2.6791,11.6138,1.8118,7.3448,0.5576,1.8148,6.8614,5.898,0.0829,10.6295,2.4553,5.314,0.848,4.4435,2.1243,3.0346,6.1448,1.6403,5.8247,0.0015,8.1539,9.6987,8.8863,4.5229,0.7251,2.1943,5.0918,0.016,3.2406,2.1925,6.2675,0.4605,0.2607,7.1665,0.0039,1.1895,3.1914,0.3524,3.95,5.7042,0.3229,2.528,4.4722,0.5231,5.5032,0.311,2.5538,0.0005,3.1881,2.1144,5.2806,5.8453,0.1305,1.3534,1.3577,2.7631,5.0512,3.0142,5.6224,3.0074,1.1363,0.7179,2.99,5.2589,3.6282,4.073,0.0117,2.3337,2.9074,0.0064,5.1917,3.549,0.1611,1.2024,0.9664,0.0017,0.0012,2.3833,4.1235,1.0157,1.0651,4.1636,4.6554,1.7661,0.3228,3.9041,1.2739,6.2953,2.0191,0.09,4.7017,0.2384,3.2085,0.4617,2.6112,3.2669,0.6222,0.9306,2.0007,5.3923,0.2583,0.6341,0.0002,4.6278,2.0947,0.1395,2.8853,1.2839,5.2029,0.5832,1.6077,1.2718,5.4785,4.9984,5.0807,5.1975,4.6104,2.8645,0.0745,1.6373,1.5983,0.1233,0.7976,0.5805,0.0002,5.1249,2.7275,0.2361,0.0002,3.4924,0.1373,0.0002,5.7632,4.1746,2.8843,0.4843,4.7931,5.3492,0.274,0.0005,0.0005,1.3043,1.9033,0.0158,4.4183,3.526,0.0174,0.0163,0.4529,1.7784,0.7533,2.0247,4.8438,1.3577,4.0872,4.3483,2.6231,4.9373,2.9571,5.5768,2.5362,5.0593,0.0709,0.2959,5.0671,4.1137,0.0022,0.0404,0.2664,0.7496,1.9828,0.4693,2.5719,0.0002,1.8471,2.9879,3.0898,2.9035,0.0836,6.6447,1.0054,0.6869,0.1233,2.8572,1.8911,4.5892,2.2934,0.2286,1.332,1.656,5.4049,1.861,1.8664,3.8219,0.0154,0.1546,0.5658,0.8444,0.7992,1.1473,5.6338,3.5376,4.0746,0.9725,2.454,1.609,1.6515,2.6928,6.6315,1.7224,5.2977,1.9513,3.1282,3.1519,2.1604,3.5803,4.5965,1.2667,2.7144,1.9581,4.1625,0.4901,0.7231,0.0002,1.7305,4.7216,6.1219,5.0358,3.5968,1.6796,1.5328,1.8231,2.9036,0.0106,1.613,0.3284,2.0543,1.1083,3.5883,4.961,3.8223,1.0884,0.1078,5.1797,0.6665,1.9832,0.1553,0.4781,1.0264,0.3688,5.2176,0.0352,0.0041,2.5402,4.4744,1.4109,1.6208,4.0906,5.4822,0.8346,2.4769,0.0015,0.3597,2.2405,1.4556,1.4106,5.0543,0.1537,3.7273,0.3142,1.1686,0.5072,2.7945,4.4421,1.8919,0.8182,0.0002,1.6179,3.7369,0.8438,4.3403,1.7918,0.3823,0.238,0.9919,1.1904,0.0002,2.4403,5.5804,5.5358,0.1937,0.6136,1.4196,0.0004,0.0003,1.6036,2.3045,2.9962,0.8811,0.8258,3.4333,1.7199,1.3619,3.152,0.7994,3.0757,2.4024,3.5515,2.6422,0.6496,2.6421,0.0105,0.7439,3.1028,0.1716,3.2086,4.9107,5.8284,2.7413,2.5766,1.9034,0.8445,1.4981,4.0119,1.2186,3.1835,0.0014,6.3195,1.7975,2.313,1.3335,2.638,1.3746,1.585,4.5171,4.5919,4.1092,0.0254,6.2197,0.8063,0.4487,0.0002,3.3669,0.4554,0.0002,2.2885,4.7598,0.6041,0.0056,1.1864,1.3176,5.7188,3.8953,0.4415,2.9437,2.903,0.3998,1.0558,0.122,0.8031,4.9471,2.0764,3.1768,4.8531,2.7408,3.9855,2.2503,3.7652,1.9533,2.9875,0.8418,0.129,1.1439,4.342,5.9088,1.4528,0.5469,0.0012,0.987,0.0004,0.0085,0.72,0.3026,0.0002,7.9644,6.6158,1.5291,0.7425,0.0007,0.0006,1.9975,1.5303,3.6887,0.5676,2.3036,0.0149,0.6146,4.9115,0.6326,1.7471,0.5019,2.8617,0.0394,0.4518,1.9377,0.6265,2.2096,3.2487,0.1457,0.6627,5.2171,1.1312,2.4663,0.8935,0.938,3.4609,2.4202,4.5658,1.8065,2.5833,6.2613,0.0251,1.84,1.7085,2.1866,4.6113,0.0402,0.4137,1.2663,0.8007,5.246,4.2227,1.6313,1.5942,2.8199,3.8855,4.3121,1.2557,4.1653,0.5929,0.4179,0.6991,0.0002,4.3878,1.2793,1.2232,2.3928,0.1568,1.3353,0.089,0.0002,0.0003,5.9797,0.1984,4.0997,1.9835,1.5467,3.7455,2.4486,3.3456,1.1662,0.9743,0.0002,2.3104,0.6587,3.1521,3.5559,0.9823,1.679,2.2969,4.0098,2.699,2.5215,4.6048,0.2623,5.9215,2.8629,0.0066,3.2103,1.6231,3.2444,1.3035,1.8079,2.5686,3.4936,2.0639,4.3138,1.4728,0.8829,0.4569,2.0944,5.8618,0.5014,2.8553,2.9045,1.0045,0.0076,1.8694,5.1203,0.6443,1.7019,3.2593,0.0041,2.2931,4.1596,0.2366,0.3364,0.0002,1.7939]}
{"id":3462,"ended":true,"length":479,"gen_text":"With a new administrative structure capable of supporting continuous growth and with its autonomy secured, Unicamp went through a period of consolidation in the 1990s. There was an increase in night programs, especially after September 11, in the year 2000.\nIt was the year 2004, when Unicamp started with programs offered for adolescents up to 26 years.\nThe growth of the organization was not a sudden development, but a gradual one that was already visible in 1986. Unicamp started its first projects for the children before 1985. The organizations' name was changed to Unicamp in 1994 and then to Encore in 2005. Encore, the youth organization, has always been part of Unicamp.\nIn addition to youth services, Encore is also involved in social work, with programs such as \"Children in Love for one year\".\nWhen asked what Encore is trying to achieve in the community and society, the members of the organization gave answers like \"Education, knowledge, and social work\", \"Strengthening the family, strengthening our children's self-esteem, and fighting violence\" and so on. The key goal of Encore is to contribute to the community.\nSarajini said that Encore is a social movement with a moral center, a platform from which members can express themselves, a way where the public can understand the values and values of the organization and so on.\nRaja said:\nOur primary goal is to be a place where the youth can speak freely without being afraid of criticism and where the public can understand what we are all about.\nEncore is also dedicated to community development. It works with partners like the municipal authority, the Youth and Sports Commission, the school, educational bodies and groups and NGOs. The organization is known for its annual community fairs and for providing opportunities for people to learn about a variety of issues in the city.\nThis website links to many of the resources, information and contacts that we have assembled on our website under Encore.\nSince its inception, Encore has maintained an objective focus and implemented its plans with dedication. In the last decades, Encore has developed its programs and developed a strong community based, volunteer base. We are one of the few communities in Greece where many young professionals have joined the community and are helping Encore to grow. We appreciate all the friends and volunteers that we have found around the world.

{"id":2288,"ended":false,"length":455,"gen_text":"Two events in bobsleigh were held at the 1952 Winter Olympics \u2014 two @ - @ man and four @ - @ man. Both were contested over four heats over two days. Two men beat three men in a race between @ - @ man and @ - @ men. And in the relay, two men did @ - @ man.\n\n- @ man and four men. And in the relay, two men did. In golf, four men \u2014 Jack Nicklaus and Nick Faldo \u2014 shot sub-60 scores on the 18th hole at the 1953 World Golf Championship-Cadillac Championship in St. Louis. As a result of the two strokes, Nicklaus was suspended for 18 weeks; Faldo was reinstated for the final week of the tournament. Faldo also won the Masters, which is probably not the best story ever.\n\nHere's another good one. During the 1966 NBA All-Star Game (yes, it was that time), some fans started a chant of \"L.A. Lakers, L.A. Lakers, L.A. Lakers\" while players walked out on the court. This prompted a team spokesman to explain the chant and the subsequent lawsuit. As the Los Angeles Times reported:\n\n\"There has been a lot of discussion about whether the chant, which the Lakers' players objected to, violated the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) and whether it was an anti-Lakers movement. Some point out the players don't even own the trademark on the name.\"\n\nThe answer to this? No, it wasn't as clear cut as all that. While the chant certainly did violate the CBA, it was more about keeping the Lakers in town than it was about controlling sports. The NFL had had a Los Angeles team since 1946 and the NBA had had an expansion team in Sacramento, Calif., in 1967; both had been owned by the City of Orange (as in Orange County, Calif.). At the time of the All-Star Game, the Lakers were owned by the MSA, the NBA's TV partner, and it was the intention of the MSA that the Lakers be left in the city; at the time of the chant, it wasn't necessarily the NBA's intention.\n\n(For more on this story, see \"Sports and Contracts\" by Mark Lemley)\n\nThis story was written by Mike McGranahan.

{"id":645,"ended":true,"length":482,"gen_text":"`` Trees `` was first published in the August 1913 issue of Poetry : A Magazine of Verse. The magazine, which had begun publishing the year before in Chicago, Illinois, quickly became enormously popular in England, where it eventually became the bestselling poetry magazine of all time. Many of the poems in the second issue were written by Sylvia Plath, and the first poem included by Emily Dickinson, \"The Ballad of the Sibyl.\" According to editor Frederick L. Farrar, \"This is one of the most remarkable and original poems printed in Poetry.\" The magazine expanded considerably in the four years following its first issue. The first volume of the magazine was published in 1917. In addition to poetry, the magazine had regular features, such as a children's book section, a humor section, and a literary features. Lest a reader think that Poetry was just another style journal, Farrar was quick to point out that it promoted \"the great art of the mind,\" and \"has its own peculiar and not so common style.\" A few months after the magazine published some of the pieces from its first issue, it changed its name to The Poetry Review. In 1925, Poetry magazine merged with the American Poetry Review, and in 1953, Poetry Review merged with New Poetry. Many of its editors became founding editors of The Modern Poetry Review, founded in 1946. After leaving Poetry magazine, Sylvia Plath's first book of poems, The Bell Jar, appeared in 1966. The book had its author in turmoil because it was rejected by nearly every reviewer. That same year Plath completed the collection of poems \"The Very Long Garden,\" published under the titles The Bell Jar and The Bell Jar and Other Poems. During this period, Sylvia Plath had been writing poetry with increasing speed and detail; the first book in the collection was written in September 1965 and published in March 1966, just before Plath's death. Her work continued under the pen names of Sylvia Plath, Ann Plath, and Edith Wharton, and with short stories, poems, fiction, and nonfiction. Most of her work is devoted to exploring, through the lives of characters she wrote about, the nature of reality. Her work has a deep connection with her childhood memories. Poems, essays, and novels have been written about her extraordinary life. Her writing has been translated into numerous languages. A biography of Sylvia Plath has been written. On 10 February 2009, I became a co-founder of Poems.org.","token_len":514,"entropy":[17.294,9.2402,7.6957,4.9915,2.9911,0.4556,2.2723,4.7918,7.7606,0.152,0.0289,8.2208,0.3425,7.0292,2.5073,2.0313,0.0542,4.8972,1.4904,2.0456,4.906,2.9628,0.998,3.3992,3.6366,3.1342,4.4652,4.9312,0.0526,3.5747,4.458,0.1673,5.873,0.068,4.5925,1.2475,5.8834,0.121,2.0642,2.9822,1.3219,1.6902,0.5844,4.4789,1.7303,0.7389,4.8076,0.8125,0.381,0.9095,1.1878,0.0221,0.217,5.211,0.4931,0.6056,0.9095,0.9662,0.697,4.8287,1.3459,1.3486,1.7519,0.5338,5.1727,0.5157,0.0001,0.6973,2.3341,2.0116,3.0236,4.196,4.2668,3.0992,5.5492,0.0079,1.4071,1.0271,1.7368,3.9951,0.0151,0.0353,1.5387,3.8226,4.9027,0.0015,1.4155,5.8042,0.0035,5.3407,5.2347,3.9398,0.3268,5.5967,2.5399,0.7776,0.1823,1.2487,3.9325,2.1802,2.4529,0.0691,0.1739,0.805,3.164,3.0331,2.6694,1.881,6.3349,0.2851,0.8031,0.0106,2.0812,1.7688,2.3172,5.2817,4.9184,1.0325,0.5858,5.8973,0.3188,1.3173,0.9959,1.3922,0.1688,1.2069,2.0691,1.9593,3.1238,1.2842,1.1526,1.0556,1.4181,0.5491,0.1928,2.8591,1.7393,2.2316,2.9126,0.1851,2.0104,0.1825,0.6321,0.2496,4.2424,3.5167,0.7313,1.7321,1.5717,0.0027,2.2204,4.7161,0.0081,3.7188,1.1396,0.7584,1.225,5.3799,0.6623,0.1265,0.7694,0.7702,3.6086,4.7998,2.3638,5.4668,3.6185,4.9659,1.5648,1.2142,0.7472,1.9916,0.0035,0.5522,2.4635,1.4471,5.8539,4.8258,0.2885,1.6934,0.0005,0.0004,3.7205,1.0321,0.0051,0.5239,0.0091,0.2346,1.8204,6.6928,1.2445,1.4615,5.0916,3.5388,0.2635,1.8939,5.3678,2.3683,1.1127,2.6257,3.466,4.8682,1.574,2.802,3.177,5.8973,3.4935,1.898,2.451,0.9494,4.2461,3.3579,1.9638,0.3599,0.6747,1.9354,5.8977,7.3179,0.247,1.3313,6.2635,2.4172,1.9452,0.3133,0.2888,0.0715,2.1714,3.1482,0.1823,0.0858,0.0966,1.4375,0.7775,0.1073,0.685,0.7011,2.2136,3.7749,0.3221,2.3704,0.0064,3.2795,3.1911,0.0369,1.5595,2.4525,0.5435,0.0299,0.1066,1.4286,1.0657,1.8923,4.8572,0.812,1.5575,0.0094,2.4779,0.8864,0.0895,4.9307,0.5375,0.0549,0.7833,5.0013,0.4178,3.207,2.8896,4.5267,4.2771,0.9475,0.1098,2.5956,4.6148,0.7088,0.0233,0.123,0.9353,4.125,0.3778,4.377,0.5202,4.7669,5.6958,0.7423,0.0044,1.6391,0.6446,0.8325,0.0093,0.0,4.36,2.8969,1.3416,1.3775,0.6064,0.3211,1.3502,0.0274,0.0053,0.2943,1.6661,0.0847,4.9178,0.2072,2.2089,1.7683,4.5587,2.3987,4.7829,4.4081,6.1032,4.2362,1.9803,0.655,2.4916,0.3113,2.9931,0.4833,5.6191,1.0662,5.8793,0.9367,0.0055,3.9661,0.0001,5.0202,1.8348,4.1299,0.9304,0.5493,2.795,1.3458,6.1799,2.8347,5.2027,0.7313,2.9405,2.9579,0.2337,6.2951,1.4262,1.0781,0.0017,0.7238,0.9525,1.1576,0.0727,1.7553,0.0371,0.1689,0.0037,0.2982,5.8037,2.1746,0.8427,0.674,2.2009,0.0162,0.0001,3.2949,2.8274,3.384,2.5552,4.3096,5.649,4.0062,1.1437,5.0091,4.1966,2.6087,3.2803,3.458,2.9758,0.9165,0.9616,1.5269,4.5834,0.6763,5.0491,2.3688,2.1574,1.8109,0.335,3.9299,0.2465,2.6532,3.1697,2.634,1.2025,0.0001,0.629,0.7666,0.4101,3.1897,3.4632,2.1979,5.8017,0.38,2.0557,1.3018,1.0646,2.629,0.392,0.0004,0.9962,5.1509,1.4306,0.0002,0.1531,0.6482,3.7094,0.1258,3.752,0.0034,2.0983,0.8701,5.7791,6.3428,0.3482,1.8533,2.2091,0.0683,5.6418,0.0506,0.4394,1.5771,0.3653,0.4106,5.3143,0.1654,0.713,1.2712,2.3795,5.7937,0.0287,3.9612,5.1344,2.8431,1.3872,4.9241,0.1681,2.7616,2.938,3.9533,0.091,0.1093,0.5016,2.3118,0.1241,5.4303,1.1354,2.0008,2.1648,1.89,3.6169,4.5194,3.2734,0.8006,1.7116,2.1573,3.4108,1.9334,4.5682,0.8808,2.6893,3.3393,0.0115,0.4394,3.9686,1.3769,1.0679,1.4814,0.4135,0.992,6.3185,0.7478,1.2575,2.3618,4.6144,1.054,0.7795,2.04,0.0772,3.3072,0.0225,1.0267,3.7575,3.7632,1.003,0.4291,0.0061,0.0,2.6828,0.2538,0.7027,2.5777,5.228,6.2411,2.4773,4.3963,0.1332,6.465,4.8418,1.9898,3.5112,0.0631,1.7456,0.185,2.988,4.7536,1.2117,1.2322,1.6195]}

It is designed to cause pain to the attacker, hopefully allowing the victim a chance to escape. @ ihrc are pushing this to kill the @ rape method of contraception. @ ihrc say this will have a dramatic impact across developing countries.\n- @ ihrc say this will have a dramatic impact across developing countries -\nYou probably understand right now that all this is pure fear mongering. And no, it will not have any impact on rape. Because if it actually were to increase the amount of rapes that take place it would have the exact opposite effect of what you are trying to achieve with this scare campaign. It has no effect. If anything, it will decrease them. If anything, this campaign by the anti-abortion group will ensure that the number of rapes in the US increase significantly. But it also decreases the amount of unwanted pregnancies that happen, increasing the amount of abortions which will decrease, and there is no correlation here. In fact, studies have shown that when you are being raped it is less likely to be the case when you are wearing this. In fact, not wearing it means that the chances of you being raped are higher. But if you were raped wearing it, you are more likely to be raped again. It also reduces the chances of getting HIV. So there is no reason for anyone to put their life at risk trying to increase the chances of being raped by wearing this. None. But it makes people panic because it looks scary and it is also based on lies that are debunked now, yet you still will not be wearing it because you are an idiot.\nBut it also increases the odds of the birth of a healthy child, so in effect this will also help with increasing the life expectancy of the country which you pretend to be fighting against. Why didn't you put this in the list of things that you will be protesting at the White House this year? I guess I can now answer that question. There is one thing about which people actually do want to protest, but you know what that makes me think? That's right, it makes me think that people don't want something the way you want it, so it isn't worth protesting. So again, even as you protest, you have absolutely no effect on anything. You have no one listening to your bullshit now. So why don't you go make the world a better place with a heart and a brain. Stop complaining about rape and start helping people instead.","token_len":515,"entropy":[8.0965,14.7643,10.6057,7.3646,11.1258,11.593,2.2521,6.8583,7.7567,7.5277,0.2091,3.2863,2.9083,2.0087,1.1946,1.5142,2.2505,1.8571,3.33,0.1757,6.9202,2.3458,2.029,1.0039,2.2362,2.2477,6.8614,5.438,1.0543,0.5981,4.5441,0.3771,0.057,0.4567,0.5588,4.3159,6.7377,3.3507,0.8475,8.696,4.421,1.6232,3.739,5.5497,2.2658,1.9855,0.7349,6.8512,2.2606,0.9894,0.6971,2.6491,2.4657,0.0786,0.0116,4.3943,2.3923,1.5402,5.5574,1.3235,3.7766,0.6374,7.7266,5.1531,0.6071,0.5605,2.9963,10.3016,1.1982,0.9729,0.0138,0.0064,0.9082,0.0114,0.0316,0.0044,0.0015,0.002,0.0007,0.0007,0.001,0.0098,8.5107,4.3107,5.4612,5.641,5.6815,6.4069,0.7224,1.0842,4.6235,1.8669,0.8374,3.5074,4.8126,0.6108,0.0,0.0008,0.9852,3.269,4.7051,1.2995,1.8877,3.49,0.2702,2.2331,1.5608,0.5503,0.613,2.5928,1.4654,4.2443,3.1103,1.1483,4.8028,4.5587,1.3031,4.4306,0.4216,4.4712,0.0124,1.1653,2.9992,1.8835,0.0017,3.373,0.2086,2.1677,1.391,1.2697,0.091,0.12,2.7385,0.2469,1.8127,1.1736,0.7869,0.0084,0.6911,3.8299,0.7529,5.1471,1.034,0.1085,2.7159,5.1831,2.464,1.2866,2.8482,3.9836,0.6203,1.0436,0.5452,1.1604,3.3097,3.6662,0.4254,3.5484,1.4066,0.3157,2.7585,2.1225,5.1587,1.2778,2.6105,0.4964,1.9744,1.9214,2.1255,6.2111,0.2427,2.4011,1.4755,0.0115,1.0104,3.3395,0.9058,3.1615,2.3514,4.5515,0.5032,3.9477,3.1651,3.447,5.5636,0.1364,2.3234,0.054,3.814,0.126,0.666,3.3417,2.5535,5.02,0.187,2.3535,0.0683,1.2685,3.7669,2.0124,3.0394,3.6506,1.8094,5.2351,0.9232,1.1244,3.7709,4.1532,0.6705,3.1001,0.4543,0.1618,4.202,0.6557,0.3134,0.1203,2.6942,2.441,4.2745,4.7024,1.8533,2.6262,0.7539,4.4373,0.0546,1.5409,1.1206,1.671,1.3197,5.5602,0.3163,0.8892,0.6108,3.7668,3.2344,2.8817,0.6119,0.1657,6.2473,0.6444,0.9186,4.3305,0.7209,1.7409,1.3534,0.2607,1.4106,0.9433,0.09,1.424,2.0349,0.4779,3.562,3.1684,0.4346,3.3795,1.8439,2.9545,0.8047,0.7986,1.3889,1.2775,1.2537,0.0621,0.0243,0.6966,0.2741,1.6692,0.5239,2.9568,3.0818,2.711,0.2483,1.9174,0.196,2.7681,3.0243,1.4979,1.81,3.3084,0.4936,0.6718,2.7833,2.4888,1.7729,0.1774,4.7365,2.0725,0.3699,0.6092,0.0438,4.9967,0.1329,3.779,0.2748,2.315,0.1423,2.1653,0.051,1.7893,0.5348,0.8087,0.6002,6.0019,0.2924,3.6314,2.7942,4.3148,3.2154,4.6599,3.5381,1.3711,3.7546,1.7012,1.166,1.8673,1.7046,4.6014,3.609,0.1525,3.0591,3.5489,1.1144,4.3533,5.4971,2.8247,4.0494,2.6635,1.437,6.5043,1.0417,2.3729,3.8671,0.5785,2.4961,1.026,0.7209,5.2752,1.0625,0.5226,1.626,3.2791,3.0628,2.361,1.4997,0.1818,4.723,0.2641,4.1891,4.0253,0.8147,0.4224,2.4602,0.8678,2.2717,2.8531,3.9715,3.7975,2.8332,1.9599,3.732,3.0022,4.33,5.1642,0.2557,3.9089,0.4802,0.3218,1.2616,2.242,3.8879,2.3756,5.1495,0.4312,0.8632,2.1441,1.4813,0.18,5.2071,6.0882,0.0014,0.1971,2.9922,1.5041,1.2528,0.8623,4.0742,0.449,1.4003,1.0454,2.1791,3.254,1.7135,5.318,3.3116,1.4325,4.7714,0.0424,3.7569,1.3495,0.2946,3.4746,2.6884,4.422,2.6362,4.4846,2.9623,0.6216,0.5769,0.6548,5.0859,0.7914,4.1634,1.5688,3.5941,3.054,5.2722,4.4756,1.6537,2.2487,0.3765,1.0644,1.8058,2.4312,2.4958,3.8342,0.9306,1.8501,6.8104,1.2191,2.7857,0.5791,2.1955,3.7147,0.0477,0.678,2.6541,0.601,0.0978,0.0707,0.3105,2.4582,2.3905,0.0007,1.2784,6.3564,6.2556,2.7258,0.9351,0.7006,0.1391,2.1373,2.0638,3.2821,4.0779,0.0004,2.0741,0.3482,0.7091,2.925,5.526,0.2461,6.1774,5.5823,1.1018,3.2859,2.3265,0.6981,3.8822,4.7608,0.3176,2.0438,0.4209,1.9789,0.6138,1.9384,2.0853,0.6873,5.3641,5.3413,0.1982,2.3789,2.5488,6.1095,1.2256,2.577,2.7317,2.8446,0.0004,0.0447,2.4996,4.2553,3.4137,2.537,0.1846,0.1289,0.0188,3.2403,3.1563,6.0103,2.6464,1.0186,0.7758,1.6996,4.0609,4.8029,0.8261,3.1625,0.7665,2.1333,3.3342,1.0193,1.5931,0.3684]}

If you are still planning to vote in another election, you can vote early or vote by mail (click here for more information).\n\nWhat is Measure B?\n\nProposition 13, known as the California Constitution Revision Initiative, is a ballot measure that seeks to enact a constitutional amendment to correct a historic voter error. Proposition 13 would rewrite and update the Constitution regarding ballot initiatives in California.\n\n\nIn 1974, the American public voted on a constitutional amendment (Proposition 13) to ban gay marriage. Unfortunately Proposition 13 failed, which was a blow to the fight for civil rights. Now the California Constitution is broken, making it difficult to implement and enforce civil rights protections in California.\n\n\nWe should fix the California Constitution because otherwise, that will be the end of civil rights protections in California.\n\n\nThis Proposition will restore civil and human rights protections under the Constitution to California.\n\nWe have a solution to a constitutional error\n\nThe original constitution required voter signatures of 7% of each voter's county, which is a very low threshold in California. Unfortunately the signatures on Proposition 12, the same California Constitution Revision Initiative, had to be gathered by an army of 1.4 million activists. The signature threshold was reached and Measure B was passed when 60% of the voters approved the measure. This is an excellent sign that voters want to help righting the wrong.\n\n\nHowever, the original constitution does not allow ballot initiatives (such as Proposition 13). Proposition 13 is an important part of our democracy. Proposition 13 can be voted on this November. Vote yes on Proposition 13 now for civil and human rights protections for every voter in California.\n\nVote Yes on Proposition 13 now -- restore civil and human rights protections.","token_len":515,"entropy":[5.5632,13.6866,6.2435,8.6419,14.7085,6.9383,4.8188,12.6195,10.7053,0.5061,7.1545,1.2249,6.4921,1.2495,13.73,0.0014,0.0166,3.4806,5.5739,0.0241,0.5318,2.3887,2.146,3.7029,1.7027,0.1674,0.0353,4.8562,0.0648,0.4829,4.7888,2.0899,0.4812,0.7714,2.0645,0.0302,1.8677,4.8706,2.4752,1.3963,5.0672,0.7549,0.1907,0.9387,2.1711,4.8257,2.4693,0.8913,6.014,1.1165,0.5913,3.1602,0.4421,2.0956,0.0198,0.4825,3.4396,0.3893,0.8489,3.1145,2.0507,7.4982,0.356,0.3123,4.3563,0.0252,0.5062,0.7345,0.3256,1.4925,0.0186,3.125,0.7005,0.131,0.396,0.5941,5.3809,1.3773,4.7399,3.8026,2.5542,1.1863,3.2259,0.1105,0.573,0.4737,5.7896,3.0524,1.4346,5.4133,5.5532,5.8109,3.7352,3.2346,3.1469,0.1521,4.1044,0.7224,3.0227,1.2334,1.1688,1.5531,0.0014,2.28,2.5165,5.3107,0.3141,0.013,3.5011,5.6455,0.1957,0.3915,2.7548,1.4962,3.9318,0.0721,3.6132,5.9562,3.794,5.9942,4.3724,3.8409,4.7477,1.9345,1.9533,1.9081,0.171,0.9394,0.2335,0.0002,3.744,5.7832,5.7777,2.9511,2.7483,0.0002,3.8672,1.5046,3.1729,0.7438,0.7862,3.0429,1.7396,1.2507,0.3128,5.9834,3.7284,3.0624,1.2873,3.974,0.4877,3.1781,0.6728,1.6815,1.9078,0.3487,0.0083,0.8899,1.6426,1.3639,1.4423,1.9482,3.2382,4.1469,1.4716,2.3631,1.6662,0.1165,0.6158,6.2246,5.6997,0.3605,0.1719,1.8795,5.4775,0.5855,0.3316,1.2748,0.1991,2.1027,1.3774,2.8044,1.6007,0.8039,0.1037,3.962,3.7537,0.2368,0.5877,1.1201,0.3862,0.5699,1.099,0.0002,4.572,1.2525,2.593,0.1457,0.1752,0.1101,0.0002,2.9814,0.0274,0.0091,2.4187,2.4298,0.2897,0.3154,2.5953,3.8715,1.7116,3.1534,0.4609,1.3087,0.4167,1.8887,0.3757,0.7578,2.2854,0.0368,4.7535,1.3547,0.9236,0.0754,0.8196,5.546,1.3884,5.1034,6.2199,1.5707,1.6218,1.9891,0.0119,2.5089,5.1509,4.1221,2.478,0.5,3.5204,6.3728,5.7767,1.8318,2.6706,0.1877,0.4414,5.2773,0.0004,3.0876,4.3818,0.5241,1.7941,6.5391,2.9682,1.586,2.4843,1.3026,1.6438,0.0403,3.7913,0.3766,0.0325,0.152,0.1242,0.9213,4.5332,2.8115,0.0678,0.7655,4.3335,4.8013,0.0399,1.4044,2.244,4.3757,2.2462,0.9027,2.4895,0.1021,1.133,4.959,0.1065,1.9647,0.0935,1.0897,4.2896,2.5099,1.9126,1.6563,1.4703,5.5913,1.8166,4.1635,0.3346,1.1872,0.8099,3.741,4.0126,1.0499,2.103,0.0445,2.3736,2.3365,0.9237,0.0971,1.4877,0.0003,4.0824,5.1679,1.5451,1.0346,1.6319,0.0449,3.9564,6.1106,1.8034,6.427,2.0751,1.3841,0.5063,1.4065,0.0376,1.5165,0.0373,1.1794,0.6134,0.184,0.1721,1.4818,0.0003,3.4883,3.5213,2.0498,2.9958,1.1929,4.3335,1.2546,0.0026,0.6874,5.3261,0.2223,3.6578,2.1551,1.937,0.7105,1.6168,0.0001,4.7453,2.858,2.048,5.1386,1.5742,4.2773,3.2189,3.4436,2.9846,0.0002,1.9645,4.3401,4.4939,5.3871,4.0966,3.1137,1.3062,3.3823,0.6949,0.1863,4.2633,3.5053,1.4323,3.7795,3.4212,2.187,1.4223,2.2778,2.4362,1.623,1.1765,3.8543,1.0303,0.2602,4.9065,2.5123,3.4596,3.9997,2.2459,5.2819,2.248,1.0459,3.6039,4.3601,1.5478,0.6949,0.1143,0.9312,4.0962,1.3913,0.1804,1.7535,1.9444,4.0755,5.186,0.0883,5.5847,1.2556,2.414,0.0417,6.0119,1.0677,2.4541,2.933,3.0501,1.0487,5.6585,3.2317,4.9811,0.1195,1.0844,1.626,5.6772,4.9169,0.1504,0.1016,0.8068,2.1974,2.558,1.1454,0.5223,0.597,2.7904,1.5672,2.7312,4.2434,4.3761,0.7098,2.6948,1.7454,0.6055,5.0481,4.3832,6.5157,0.8645,0.3896,2.1038,0.9766,0.0003,3.4215,0.1729,1.6101,3.0817,1.3142,2.8339,0.2262,2.2846,4.5144,0.5888,5.3107,4.2187,0.004,1.0957,0.0382,2.8322,2.7152,0.0881,2.006,2.0187,3.5872,3.2689,0.0042,1.4593,1.2527,1.5972,3.1755,0.0163,5.0539,1.7513,5.5898,0.1127,3.734,0.2499,1.4093,5.5522,1.1284,0.567,0.8641,0.0085,5.1503,4.6704,1.3889,0.6969,0.016,0.0036,0.7699,1.7424,3.7742,3.2297,0.4865,0.0851,0.2162,0.8654,0.0002,3.4852,1.657,0.2145,0.3177,0.0083,2.0871,7.4738,4.2186,0.2615,0.0766,0.0019,0.0013,0.2614,3.7931]}
{"id":225,"ended":false,"length":496,"gen_text":"Nicole had a brief relationship with Penn Graham ( Christian Clark ) and after he was murdered, she discovered that she was pregnant with his child. James told Sunrise that viewers could expect \"bizarre drama\" in the coming episodes of the show. During the conversation, he also addressed the upcoming finale:When asked about Nicole's character on the upcoming series, James said,It sounds as though James might reveal Nicole's identity. After all, she has had her face shown multiple times thus far during the show.James revealed on the show he had a very difficult time trying to give up smoking. He claims that smoking has taken away his energy. On the other hand, he admits to the show that he still enjoys the taste of tobacco even though he is not a smoker.James discussed what he thinks may have happened to his friend. As a result of trying to kill another man, Nicole probably suffers from some mental disease, though he can't remember whether it's schizophrenia, bipolar, or some other mental illness. It's also not clear whether she also has substance misuse issues.James made some surprising confessions while he discussed Nicole's character. He revealed that when he left the show, he was very disappointed to have his friendship with Penn Graham end. But he has met some members of Penny's family whom he has not seen since his departure. When asked if he thinks Penny ( Aimee Teegarden ) will reveal the identity of her father, James said,There are a lot of possible spoilers associated with this question but we'll let you speculate on whether or not that's true. As James recently revealed that he will not be returning to the show, it won't be long before the truth about Nicole comes to light, though as James has gone on record saying that he still enjoys the taste of tobacco, we know at least one character won't be in the dark.Nicole has been portrayed as extremely dangerous and manipulative in her interactions with others. At first glance, her character seems like the most likely to reveal her true identity. She often makes threats against James and Penn when trying to manipulate them.

In contrast, the term 'Littoral' is used to describe the South Pacific Littoral where it includes East China Sea and Indian Ocean. It has little bearing on the Middle and West Pacific Littoral, and the term 'Littoral' is not used in the context of the north Pacific.\n\n\nHowever, some of the key terms used in the context of the South Pacific includes 'Littoral of the Americas ', 'Littoral of the Pacific', 'Littoral of the Indian (Oceanic)', 'Littoral of the East Pacific', 'Littoral of the Indian Ocean', 'Reed Sea Littoral', 'Middle Littoral', 'Ports of Entry', 'Chagos Archipelago'. The term 'Reed Sea Littoral' is the term used in the New Zealand context.\n\n\nThe South Pacific\/Pacific-Reed Sea-Chagos archipelago is not a significant place in terms of the term 'Pacific littoral' in the New Zealand context but is an important place in terms of the term in the New Zealand Pacific region.\n\n\nAccording to the National Party government's policy,'Littoral of the Americas ', referring to the South Pacific region, was intended to include the Strait of Magellan, Southwest Pacific region including Indonesia, East China Sea, South China Sea, South Sea, Malacca Strait, South China Sea.\n\n\nIf one accepts that the South Pacific includes the South China Sea and the South Sea (or 'Reed', as it is called) and the Middle and West Pacific Littoral, one cannot accept the South Pacific region is included in the Pacific littoral. Therefore, Pedra Branca is a littoral region in the New Zealand context.","token_len":519,"entropy":[1.6833,8.6385,1.7803,6.1241,0.9614,13.5584,1.8879,0.3285,0.0002,2.7591,11.7229,5.8956,0.8237,4.7457,6.0941,0.2082,2.5013,0.5224,3.0772,3.0115,1.1448,3.9722,2.385,7.9908,0.5765,4.1166,10.7235,0.1311,1.4244,0.1024,0.0131,0.0035,1.5365,10.8496,0.2507,9.8744,0.0039,0.001,0.0002,1.0457,3.4645,3.793,4.6608,0.7813,4.0758,1.6896,2.5261,0.1133,0.0024,1.3722,3.964,1.4235,0.005,0.7295,0.0014,0.0023,0.0,2.0674,1.4197,5.1167,0.7886,1.0107,5.2276,3.3872,5.18,4.3911,0.8587,0.0007,0.0026,0.0001,2.3842,0.7629,4.3252,2.7997,4.8069,1.5735,2.9568,1.1095,1.5418,0.2805,4.3906,5.4114,1.0083,0.8608,0.0009,0.0012,0.0001,1.067,4.2947,2.781,1.8789,2.2931,0.1576,0.0028,0.3222,3.0667,0.0002,1.8513,5.2873,2.1454,4.9636,5.5413,0.0186,0.0105,0.1273,1.4545,1.2181,1.672,1.1286,3.4534,0.0398,0.842,5.4624,1.1751,4.9225,1.5884,4.0605,0.5855,4.8956,0.0099,2.4349,0.0006,1.1711,4.0008,5.7147,0.5079,3.6632,3.037,0.7409,3.3223,5.5585,6.0486,1.4646,0.1405,0.3691,2.6136,2.1987,0.1539,4.7773,2.5739,0.6228,6.9711,0.1152,0.9733,3.0798,0.0104,7.2794,5.027,0.4558,4.3242,0.5512,1.4308,6.2166,1.1024,0.9678,4.6297,2.8281,3.4591,0.2501,0.5452,0.4572,0.254,2.9434,0.0278,0.0157,0.3554,0.5046,0.2668,1.9092,0.8415,0.417,2.0371,0.3574,4.9719,0.004,0.0219,2.6438,1.2731,0.4497,5.6537,2.5255,0.0183,1.6149,4.5915,0.0294,0.8376,3.5602,2.4604,7.0342,4.214,0.2405,0.2975,5.8719,0.819,3.3712,0.1075,1.152,0.0003,0.4728,2.2479,2.9333,2.016,1.6103,0.3764,1.8579,0.0115,0.0191,0.1158,0.7513,2.0566,0.6638,0.9624,0.5739,0.7745,0.0161,0.6018,6.1394,0.2045,1.1824,0.7729,0.0002,4.8488,0.0692,4.0174,2.5548,0.1715,5.5328,4.2163,0.8815,0.4662,0.5118,3.0101,0.0193,0.4112,1.3291,0.1928,6.0067,1.5228,2.3952,0.1605,0.0618,4.6595,0.8758,4.5208,5.3656,0.2223,0.423,0.0027,0.0031,0.1036,0.5395,1.1545,1.3932,0.1377,0.44,0.0039,0.0019,0.0823,0.2637,1.4373,7.0234,1.968,1.5381,0.2406,0.5025,0.2348,0.3524,0.0036,0.0014,0.0698,0.1989,4.0736,1.1524,0.6983,0.2427,0.263,0.003,0.0011,0.042,0.1032,2.0386,0.5069,0.6246,0.2386,6.1886,6.3846,0.7594,3.4317,0.0085,0.0032,0.5478,0.1846,4.7561,2.6059,0.0177,0.0016,0.601,0.1752,4.8063,5.4902,0.7053,2.0979,0.78,0.15,5.2752,0.7623,1.2381,0.0001,0.0127,3.9156,2.7646,1.0994,0.1063,2.4967,0.0889,0.0293,0.4551,0.0006,0.0005,0.0435,0.8026,3.8444,1.5428,0.367,1.0075,0.3296,6.1508,0.5442,0.4472,1.0562,0.7461,0.0002,1.419,3.0793,0.1258,6.3142,1.4612,5.7553,3.7646,0.0722,0.0681,3.4471,1.3024,0.005,1.9769,0.0002,0.008,0.8014,2.7316,1.1818,5.8423,5.0225,0.619,2.4821,0.0016,2.0282,5.8109,0.2636,1.3879,0.5545,0.0001,0.0012,0.9882,2.2643,0.4861,3.0806,0.0247,0.064,4.1797,1.8731,3.4741,0.2143,0.3895,0.259,0.8822,0.0025,0.3126,0.9035,3.2406,0.2223,2.1073,0.3285,3.6675,3.0164,0.399,0.9985,0.0002,5.2899,0.0612,0.4926,4.2101,4.7023,2.5467,1.5403,2.2843,13.3207,3.963,0.1231,0.018,1.6633,0.0834,1.1312,6.562,7.502,0.03,0.3316,1.1677,0.1018,3.4515,0.4262,5.2038,3.137,0.1614,2.2522,0.6757,4.1277,0.0029,0.0071,0.0002,1.0018,7.0092,0.8944,4.2822,3.0226,5.4665,0.4344,3.7862,1.1663,0.0155,0.7871,1.5522,0.1352,0.0107,0.4671,2.025,2.7796,0.5836,4.9223,0.148,0.2845,0.3238,2.9987,1.0043,0.0492,4.1064,1.1467,0.0003,5.3051,3.2946,3.6724,0.7835,0.9323,1.8618,0.0775,3.1334,0.571,2.4651,0.1084,0.0295,1.244,0.8299,1.2867,0.5644,3.2943,3.7978,4.4687,2.0711,0.0812,5.0018,0.9414,1.0345,0.2842,1.4487,2.8112,1.7812,1.1749,2.2409,0.5337,0.1368,0.0054,1.1027,0.0003,0.1573,0.8243,3.2791,4.0241,3.6547,1.4517,3.8938,0.3426,4.7278,3.2314,4.2163,0.3026,0.2507,1.0841,0.5198,0.0003,0.0061,0.8304,3.6176,0.2016,4.8696,0.0025,0.0028,0.0001,1.1584,2.3438,3.1444,0.0006,0.0016,4.6517,1.6836,0.2234,1.0135,0.0038,0.5305,0.8693]}
{"id":3915,"ended":true,"length":458,"gen_text":"Rider Haggard returned to Britain in 1881. At the time, England was increasingly beset by the social and cultural anxieties that marked the fin de si\u00e8cle. One of the most prominent concerns was the growing number of people who were either homeless or on the verge of homelessness, and who were either mentally ill or were dependent on mental workers.\n\nHaggard's travels included visits to America, America's other significant frontier, where he observed the transition from frontier man to frontier man and the effects of the Civil War on the American landscape. He also chronicled his efforts to improve the conditions for those suffering from mental illness, writing extensively about it. On the other hand, he was also a strong proponent of a society based on individual liberty, and he argued strongly with those such as William Lloyd Garrison, who viewed the abolition of slavery as a means to establish a socialist society in the American colonies.\n\nHe remained in England throughout the 1870s and lived in the home of fellow poet and critic John Keats. Keats and Haggard often corresponded and Haggard published a collection of Keats poems. In 1887 Haggard married Emma Marjoribanks, who wrote for the magazine Commonweal and who produced two children with him.\n\nHis most famous work, On the Road, is one of the defining books of the American \" Beat Generation.\" It was first published in 1938 and later republished. It is an autobiographical narrative of a visit he paid to America in 1881 and his reaction to it.\n\nAn important influence on Haggard was Ezra Pound, whose work he read in school and later encountered in the army. Haggard wrote a book praising Pound titled, \"An American by birth, a Briton by choice, a poet for the trenches.\" This is the book that helped spark the Beat Movement in which Haggard was a prominent member. Although many of the Beat Movement's leaders were also members of the John Birch Society, Haggard was one of its first major leaders. He joined the BLS when it was founded in 1921, but left for the John Birch Society in 1932 when the BLS became overtly political.\n\nAlong with his poet wife, Emma Marjoribanks, Haggard became increasingly outspoken about the evils of the New Deal and the evils of Communism. Haggard supported those who attempted to break with the New Deal, such as a number of young pacifists such as Abbie Hoffman.

In 1949 he was posthumously given the title of Hero of the German People, and in 1954 he was awarded the title of Knight Commander of the Order of the Silver Star ( Knight of the Order of the Green Dragon ). In 1981 he was awarded the Order of German Historical Honour ( Order of the Knight) by the State of Rhineland-Palatinate. On 14 May 1999, former First Lieutenant Karl M\u00f6lders was officially proclaimed as the only man known to have survived the famous \" Battle of the Bulge \" ( 3\/May-16\/May), and today the same order has been renamed as the Karl M\u00f6lders Memorial Order of Honor. The memorial was completed in 2008 and honors M\u00f6lders's sacrifice in the Battle of the Bulge. The memorial is a stone structure located at Heiderscheidt, Germany and consists of a rectangular stone base and a bronze plate on which the name of each combatant of the Bulge battle is engraved:\nThe inscription in German on the memorial plate is:\n\"The name of each soldier of the 3rd Army whose name is engraved on this monument with bronze plates was given by a group of German commanders, including Generalmajor Karl Friedrich M\u00f6lders, who survived the battle at Meldt and the ensuing battle of the Alsace. This battle gave him the courage to re-emerge from the battlefield and return to his battalion. As is well known, the 3rd Army had already lost over 2,000 soldiers, but M\u00f6lders was the only survivor of this famous battle.\"","token_len":521,"entropy":[2.8777,0.9143,6.6695,1.0419,6.1673,3.6038,3.9822,0.0323,2.8972,5.9182,0.2185,4.8053,3.9484,4.9716,2.3042,3.183,1.5277,3.7387,0.5824,6.5513,0.8014,0.4953,1.4382,8.4628,0.1586,1.197,0.0023,0.0334,0.0007,5.9355,2.0563,8.4532,0.1893,0.252,1.2962,4.7801,2.4228,5.1911,1.6455,3.5328,4.0179,8.633,6.2535,2.3338,3.5822,0.4392,4.5362,0.6617,1.7063,1.0584,0.7387,2.3695,4.9012,0.282,1.4521,2.5105,0.1368,0.0005,1.9597,1.9679,2.7952,3.7536,3.5367,0.2039,0.0867,3.7321,0.0173,0.0705,0.0015,0.0012,0.0008,1.6989,2.8249,1.6239,3.3046,5.3423,4.4636,6.0381,2.4779,0.7311,0.0097,5.8889,2.7486,0.5412,3.1091,0.7902,1.3602,8.4036,0.598,2.2036,4.1803,3.6002,1.4924,0.598,0.6651,0.6181,0.0017,0.0018,0.0009,1.1054,4.5897,2.5115,4.723,0.8978,2.5671,0.0002,2.7901,3.297,2.2451,1.2666,6.1709,3.9749,0.2208,3.5523,0.2181,2.8039,2.9519,0.1304,2.5259,0.7259,0.1127,2.9572,0.0825,0.0281,1.482,0.1535,3.3189,3.2487,6.0383,6.0721,1.1559,0.8996,1.6936,0.1373,0.6789,1.5738,0.5113,0.022,0.2701,0.224,4.8658,0.5815,5.0008,0.1425,2.8739,0.2931,0.4199,2.4018,0.0009,0.0009,0.0006,0.0012,4.0289,3.2012,2.1365,1.541,0.1751,5.1832,0.7002,4.0931,2.9422,0.5282,0.1922,0.0088,3.8476,1.9986,4.763,1.5056,0.0096,0.2743,3.3108,0.0076,0.002,0.308,0.1567,0.8062,0.0024,0.0027,0.0014,4.8881,2.582,1.6916,0.1402,0.6134,0.1541,1.5736,2.0832,4.655,5.1629,1.5113,0.0788,4.6526,1.5079,3.4922,3.9177,0.1249,0.288,0.7604,3.0757,4.1116,0.9622,0.4737,3.5638,0.0001,0.0008,3.9482,0.2463,1.5281,0.3163,2.4807,0.0217,0.2417,1.2422,0.7112,1.9934,1.4749,1.0207,3.2275,0.8275,0.2776,0.9955,0.1776,2.6922,0.0905,1.1664,1.7014,0.3113,0.0717,1.1276,0.0047,0.6884,5.1554,1.1427,2.6984,3.4807,1.207,0.1723,1.9966,0.0951,0.7248,6.4831,1.8774,1.6969,2.396,4.8147,0.6284,0.229,0.9969,0.1247,2.4106,0.0079,5.7742,5.0176,5.3285,1.371,2.0205,0.2107,0.5523,2.038,3.8814,1.0799,0.4506,3.8083,0.0759,4.1722,0.0195,0.0,0.1979,0.0075,0.0001,0.0004,0.5193,2.9436,3.8231,2.4976,3.935,0.9749,6.3465,5.8623,0.9294,4.8601,1.2073,0.0032,0.0124,0.0018,0.4796,4.4545,2.7567,1.228,0.7026,4.6874,4.3757,5.0127,0.1066,0.0622,0.6957,0.52,6.217,3.2412,3.8264,0.0323,0.316,0.0239,0.0001,1.5699,2.4711,6.2226,4.0831,6.0111,0.4984,3.6265,0.1908,0.6092,2.2748,1.4153,6.1634,3.376,5.4347,4.654,3.3023,0.1992,5.1317,1.5304,0.2364,2.1805,0.4276,0.0052,0.0189,0.0095,3.0223,1.5044,0.477,4.0228,0.8121,2.9808,4.3778,1.2391,4.4324,0.4715,3.7749,1.2368,6.4874,3.3034,0.0013,0.002,0.0047,2.5381,4.2964,1.8448,0.604,2.907,0.0901,0.0631,0.0011,0.0,0.7603,1.9377,0.9646,1.1852,3.2343,3.2021,1.9754,2.3035,1.6656,5.8137,3.1428,0.1716,0.0864,1.7617,1.923,3.2472,2.5582,3.1689,0.0149,1.0022,4.1541,1.8982,1.9022,2.2805,0.8274,3.031,4.9518,1.9665,0.9286,1.7823,1.9274,0.8052,3.2311,5.4823,0.1259,3.1578,0.3772,2.4381,0.001,2.4702,0.5483,1.0311,4.1306,1.971,1.777,3.3233,3.1203,0.8178,2.7223,0.054,1.1778,2.8673,2.3372,1.2661,0.4195,1.6062,3.2259,2.7391,0.2836,0.6817,2.6752,1.7809,0.249,3.2212,0.1695,2.9602,5.0468,1.2358,0.7011,0.6788,0.963,0.4408,2.4219,6.4815,2.0654,2.6932,3.0072,3.7974,1.6026,2.7216,4.9513,0.1468,2.4825,6.0489,2.5812,2.5156,1.2039,1.2887,1.2495,4.5696,0.1021,0.0042,0.0105,0.0037,0.9906,1.1631,3.2224,0.1996,0.8692,3.424,6.9575,4.2535,3.038,2.218,2.6405,4.2837,2.5305,0.895,0.4364,7.4175,0.296,0.0492,1.9438,2.8639,4.8424,5.1201,2.196,0.6186,4.6506,0.2766,5.2711,1.6834,5.1167,0.0002,0.69,0.5234,3.866,1.2745,2.7304,0.1474,1.2569,5.1637,1.8051,4.2122,5.3192,2.4845,0.106,0.1714,1.9492,3.2613,0.0325,0.0882,2.7342,4.1384,2.1446,3.1791,3.5603,0.1003,0.5098,2.1687,2.9313,1.6178,1.9949,0.0018,0.0015,0.0134,2.0238,1.0421,0.1885,1.7344,0.9903,2.4906,3.8037,0.1945,1.3238]}
{"id":473,"ended":true,"length":467,"gen_text":"In 2003, Nesbitt played undercover police detective Tommy Murphy in the first series of Murphy's Law, after starring in a successful pilot episode in 2001. The series was conceived when Nesbitt, played by Richard Ayoade, suggested using him on the show.\n\nThe Office is Nesbitt's first British series since 2001's Home for Good, in which he starred alongside Damian Lewis and Jude Law. Nesbitt has also appeared in ITV crime drama Broadchurch and Channel 4 drama The Bill\n\nAhead of what he has described as his \"miserable period\" filming the show, Nesbitt spoke to the Radio Times ahead of its new series premiere this Wednesday (31 June), revealing that he was \"very sad\".\n\nNesbitt said: \"The one thing I found particularly difficult was to do more shows with the same script, with the same tone, with the same feel. But it was also really difficult to go away and do nothing.\"\n\nHe added that there was \"no point\" in telling fans who have complained about some of the series' early episodes that he might return.\n\n\"It's really sad to feel that I should have said that, because I didn't really think it would happen,\" he said. \"But I guess the way to give the characters some space is, it's so long ago, people now have moved on.\n\nMeanwhile, Nesbitt has confirmed that he will no longer be associated with British Comedy Awards. \"We got in trouble because we didn't do as well in the past three years,\" he admitted, adding that he will only be taking part in the 2017 edition.\n\nNesbitt went on to explain that the awards will continue to operate, as they did \"at least 10 years ago\", but that his involvement in the organisation was over.\n\n\"I think if I was to say anything, that would be a huge disservice to the audience because everyone will say I was the biggest idiot in the world for getting into these things when it was going really badly for us.\"\n\nNesbitt has said that he will continue to record comedy for YouTube and will continue to produce sketch and stand-up shows, as well giving radio and film appearances.\n\nThe Office was created by Stephen Merchant and Simon Blackwell. It is executive produced by Merchant and Brooker for Merchant and Jerry Weintraub, with Mark Weitzman and Sam Bain. The series is adapted from the BBC comedy book by David Nicholls.","token_len":523,"entropy":[6.4269,0.2382,6.5465,4.8796,1.0345,0.0254,6.3425,9.8162,5.1949,3.0946,5.4895,6.3759,0.5651,0.6969,4.6049,2.6645,0.0429,4.6168,0.2997,0.1046,0.8331,5.7265,3.7554,0.5968,2.5818,4.0874,5.1209,3.1621,2.4585,3.0631,0.2319,2.5538,1.6488,1.2794,6.9224,5.0663,1.8912,0.0007,0.0005,0.0007,2.5719,5.2399,0.2169,4.2015,2.0211,0.0008,0.0001,0.0905,5.2831,4.8071,2.801,5.6357,0.6685,0.7148,1.3617,0.8421,0.0005,2.0776,7.0606,2.761,6.8359,0.0009,0.0006,0.0006,0.0078,1.0199,3.8586,1.5571,1.3735,4.4611,0.2506,5.9091,5.3919,1.5209,0.8138,1.2399,0.0034,0.0563,1.3746,0.7166,5.0961,0.0012,1.282,5.2554,0.0012,0.1236,3.0246,0.0005,0.0004,0.0007,2.1997,1.0581,1.0583,0.2007,3.8492,3.8594,0.2983,2.4751,0.0011,0.9283,2.9338,0.058,1.7581,1.6575,4.5207,7.4032,0.0003,3.7668,4.6478,0.0025,6.8751,2.0565,2.1596,0.4537,0.0081,1.5956,0.6611,5.6018,2.5163,0.0231,5.6572,0.3786,4.6111,1.4163,2.6267,0.2088,0.3569,0.0005,0.0003,0.0007,2.6213,0.7426,1.3405,1.6339,0.014,2.7891,0.0025,1.7832,3.0451,0.3952,1.5193,3.298,3.2196,1.1155,5.7146,4.2092,2.1977,2.9208,1.0874,0.6239,2.0775,1.6191,2.9217,3.2623,3.4599,0.0675,0.0003,2.9757,0.0111,0.0004,0.0009,1.0991,0.288,0.0133,2.9669,5.1454,0.3455,0.6122,5.1653,4.5046,1.2944,0.7636,2.8896,3.6553,6.5441,6.5806,2.8254,1.3999,0.1434,4.3394,1.5987,3.0106,0.2283,0.0097,5.3581,1.154,1.6802,0.1269,0.0073,4.6945,0.7012,3.8432,2.2312,1.1741,2.837,3.0246,2.3606,0.4524,3.3933,3.0611,1.3878,1.277,3.2688,2.7748,0.0361,0.0003,1.334,0.7044,2.1542,4.5014,0.9588,0.9109,1.4477,2.164,0.5424,0.5331,5.7716,2.625,3.6782,1.7934,6.1604,0.4965,5.8342,0.2986,0.1934,2.5126,0.6685,5.8134,0.2657,0.6018,1.4701,5.8943,1.478,1.2421,0.2798,0.0003,0.7712,2.2731,0.5355,3.9818,3.048,1.8162,5.5561,1.2674,2.2693,4.9091,1.5197,3.6431,2.247,2.0345,1.8267,1.1118,2.7245,0.0003,3.2344,2.1126,1.7945,1.0857,0.7166,0.8423,0.2997,0.2425,0.0676,0.5165,1.6273,1.2277,3.7565,2.8434,3.532,3.5292,5.8231,2.339,5.8318,2.8434,2.6044,0.7744,4.7134,3.726,0.4032,5.5905,3.7595,1.0205,1.6496,4.1346,5.4795,1.9961,2.8047,0.0165,1.1083,1.0564,0.0003,8.8247,0.0719,1.1763,0.0005,0.0002,0.0012,1.4392,3.4729,0.3971,0.6209,0.7904,5.0153,0.0051,0.4033,6.0623,0.0071,4.9169,5.5909,0.6146,1.2161,2.1762,3.8328,5.0296,3.358,2.0796,3.3045,0.7955,2.184,0.0003,2.8343,4.0185,0.9839,3.3435,0.3248,4.5104,4.4878,0.068,1.7662,0.0985,3.2399,2.5356,1.4682,0.3551,0.9921,2.9355,5.3023,0.8528,2.9912,0.0861,0.2209,0.4464,4.9044,2.8417,0.7298,0.3368,0.0003,1.7049,0.0033,0.0004,0.0013,5.0812,0.0341,0.1091,2.8932,0.5319,1.7525,3.3387,3.8823,2.6194,0.6031,3.393,1.8518,3.3271,2.0534,2.2861,5.3128,3.8705,1.4534,4.1169,0.0914,0.1426,0.8054,0.609,1.608,3.7628,1.0003,2.6319,0.7581,1.7405,2.3221,1.7149,0.1672,0.458,0.0003,0.7751,0.7996,2.7745,4.5663,1.472,1.9842,2.2087,3.9257,1.7585,1.6958,3.7853,1.2686,0.4258,1.9832,3.9782,3.7349,0.0079,0.1535,0.6685,3.5059,3.3902,5.6002,4.2395,3.1107,2.467,1.6691,1.8488,3.8071,3.7308,1.6777,0.3259,0.426,2.1445,3.9074,3.0524,4.8395,1.1219,3.7449,2.9897,1.027,4.0972,2.6824,0.7798,1.8858,1.4961,2.2171,0.3252,0.0002,1.6283,0.003,0.0004,0.0014,2.8261,3.8313,0.6871,0.4927,1.5856,2.2974,0.1417,5.6953,2.8359,2.3115,5.3743,1.85,2.6631,1.8891,0.0834,2.908,5.3405,1.6686,2.8062,0.175,0.001,1.7098,2.0523,2.2041,0.2437,9.7551,5.8835,0.7215,5.4687,1.0146,0.094,0.4301,0.0002,1.8284,1.9684,4.2413,2.2842,0.0552,2.234,0.0379,0.3508,3.2181,0.1842,1.9537,1.5123,2.0247,2.0899,0.1382,0.0142,0.6564,1.0371,4.1596,0.5022,3.733,1.9681,2.3858,6.4834,0.7453,0.0147,0.0002,0.0,2.183,1.7498,4.8069,2.043,1.6751,0.0282,0.8627,5.2693,0.6445,1.9319,2.5445,1.0105,1.1513,5.3574,0.1507,0.8309,3.648,1.5036,5.9288,1.6866,3.8594,5.5422,0.0016,0.8974]}

On 4 February, that audience rose to 456, @ 000.\n\nAs a result, the series saw a third week increase to 483, @,000.","token_len":523,"entropy":[5.2677,3.9248,0.1878,12.665,1.6666,0.0008,4.8708,0.6832,5.6778,0.4177,3.2428,4.0088,1.7956,0.5266,4.0744,7.1621,14.3391,8.3429,9.5562,9.8517,2.9515,4.8215,5.8676,2.4439,1.0555,1.234,5.345,3.4586,0.4675,3.2547,2.0687,0.0665,6.13,1.2154,0.2724,0.0835,0.1636,0.8232,1.6436,0.0052,4.189,1.121,3.5826,1.876,4.9665,3.6768,0.889,0.0166,0.0001,1.9737,1.0351,2.8257,0.0843,0.0003,4.229,5.3108,4.0573,4.1641,4.1023,1.0378,1.4886,1.5808,5.6162,0.605,1.6787,4.8942,2.5512,2.5248,0.1353,0.4932,2.358,2.2743,1.317,2.3456,2.5495,0.185,0.0236,1.8696,4.3459,0.6562,4.4215,0.4404,4.5494,4.5028,1.0617,5.1321,6.9204,1.7201,0.2309,2.3482,5.3996,1.515,0.8922,1.2274,5.0375,0.1059,0.4705,0.0175,0.9031,2.9926,3.0966,0.4397,1.11,0.7201,2.5911,1.0399,5.2827,1.6052,1.6293,0.4972,0.6509,4.6241,0.0189,0.0362,0.0079,0.3872,4.8379,0.0321,0.0001,1.791,1.6063,2.1138,1.7911,2.1039,0.0381,0.0,2.2698,0.8205,0.9584,0.576,3.0087,3.992,4.6582,0.0248,2.9092,0.022,0.9977,0.5076,0.0002,5.3826,3.6712,5.8918,4.7406,0.1655,0.0195,0.0011,0.0068,1.1116,3.4976,0.4232,0.491,0.0002,1.4521,0.0035,0.0049,0.0023,0.0009,2.6923,0.2596,2.7464,0.9286,2.4402,1.0496,3.4351,0.173,3.519,3.2896,0.8335,4.4461,2.4247,0.2494,0.4899,0.7693,4.9637,2.3121,0.7457,0.9242,1.2458,3.5957,0.6825,1.0747,3.9874,0.3697,2.3021,0.0002,1.6676,4.7451,1.0872,1.5794,2.6314,1.323,0.2696,1.2461,0.3081,0.4558,3.4519,2.9168,1.9785,2.5496,4.5515,0.0381,1.592,0.0781,3.8438,4.5863,3.798,2.5837,1.0362,4.3366,0.0132,0.007,0.0064,0.3661,3.6054,1.9722,0.4827,2.5669,1.1328,0.2367,1.6901,1.1817,3.47,2.2896,1.6415,1.1347,0.0012,1.3897,4.7624,0.9011,1.8083,1.3384,2.5816,1.093,4.1705,2.9606,0.1159,4.621,0.0522,2.0473,1.5867,2.889,0.0125,0.1621,0.0114,0.2665,0.74,0.0002,4.9427,0.0703,3.1078,1.4114,3.6602,6.2008,0.2808,1.6285,2.531,3.6792,3.2744,0.0155,0.4332,0.0139,0.5283,0.7514,0.0002,0.2386,0.4858,0.0597,2.6862,0.0004,0.0036,0.01,0.0165,0.0308,0.0002,1.3263,0.0029,5.5659,4.0609,1.711,0.5926,1.7943,3.5232,3.6547,0.5894,0.2012,0.5074,0.613,1.6401,2.4461,0.0287,0.3303,1.6632,0.0002,1.9425,0.8542,5.5753,0.1587,0.1743,0.7093,0.0846,2.0144,0.2758,1.2341,4.383,1.7757,0.694,1.2736,3.3387,1.0224,3.8556,4.7075,3.4053,4.8209,5.5297,2.1806,0.7327,2.3373,1.3496,0.8937,0.164,0.7273,1.2289,0.8696,2.0501,4.5138,1.2556,1.3994,2.1544,3.633,0.7254,3.009,1.0284,6.4887,0.0139,0.1354,0.0143,1.5223,2.4618,0.2488,5.8268,0.5238,2.394,0.3729,2.1328,0.3798,0.459,2.8658,1.1618,1.8168,0.8872,3.1707,0.1617,0.6395,0.2706,0.2093,3.1316,5.3057,1.0527,1.499,1.7444,0.8105,3.0799,0.966,3.4808,0.1797,0.3956,1.0212,0.116,0.2437,0.2723,0.0002,5.4088,3.2655,0.2806,0.7385,3.9617,1.3373,0.1396,0.9411,0.1811,0.5588,0.8273,2.2157,1.6818,0.6217,1.4474,0.0874,0.8587,2.5434,0.4744,4.1846,3.0446,0.0753,4.3008,1.8153,2.215,0.1712,1.3555,3.1912,4.9705,5.0496,0.8842,1.0919,0.0166,3.207,5.8231,0.5642,2.3287,3.0841,3.2217,0.2614,1.1532,0.0002,4.9463,2.8815,1.634,2.3599,0.1201,0.1065,1.2485,2.9408,0.6019,1.2515,3.2357,3.1185,0.5946,1.0013,3.2557,2.4866,5.7377,5.4645,2.8619,2.5946,4.6861,6.1654,3.8933,5.0635,2.9613,3.246,2.3415,1.5531,4.8892,4.6769,0.0524,3.8755,6.0179,1.6441,0.6559,3.2179,0.8728,3.637,3.9427,0.2129,1.5119,2.3583,5.602,0.0238,2.4228,4.6488,3.8895,1.9456,0.6766,0.4545,0.0002,4.3498,4.6918,0.2929,1.4366,0.0022,2.7343,2.5335,0.291,2.1721,1.1142,1.3131,6.8483,3.1681,2.2011,1.9622,0.3745,0.028,2.7863,4.4161,0.0102,1.0234,0.0111,0.286,5.0834,2.7182,0.092,0.1087,5.1502,0.5959,2.0829,0.4043,1.0099,3.0252,0.0058,0.0219,0.0062,0.3331,0.6209,0.0002,4.371,2.1911,0.8278,0.6495,1.1836,1.1177,3.9201,1.0575,2.4106,0.5056,0.2442,0.4398,3.3577,2.0708,0.0037,0.0062,10.387,3.6097,0.2303]}
{"id":2834,"ended":false,"length":472,"gen_text":"As a relatively rural environment in an increasingly urbanised area, Kersal Moor was also used for more peaceful pursuits. During the 18th and 19th centuries it was much frequented by amateur naturalists and landscape architects. The presence in the area of such people, who could observe species, flora and fauna with increased precision and knowledge also meant that those species were recorded and the descriptions provided to the public as well as other scientists.\n\nIn the early 19th century, the area was popular and well known as a setting for the breeding and raising of geese where young birds were used to support the parent birds in the breeding season or as nestlings. This continued from the 19th century up to the early 20th century when the geese were bred in pens. In particular, this attracted the attention of an increasing number of collectors of ornamental bird fashions who were keen to have their aviaries in the area.\n\nDuring the early decades of the 20th century, the geese became much more prized and, as there was so much natural habitat available to them, many of them were sold. They were particularly popular in the USA, where they were bred in many flocks to give the impression of some kind of real estate boom. Geese were also imported by ship from England, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Argentina. In the 1960s (the last decade of the 19th century) the breed had been reduced so much that the local population fell from 8.000 to 6.000 and had begun to decline in subsequent years due to changes in land use, diseases and mortality. In the 1990s this level of breeding was restored and the flock of geese was reduced from 20 tonnes to below 15 tonnes. The breeding population had become so low so early in the 20th century that they were reduced to a population size which was not adequate to preserve the genetic diversity of this species. Although many of these geese are still alive, we felt that the geese were not likely to survive beyond the current century.\n\nI am so grateful to the staff of the Kersal Moor Nature Reserve for the hospitality offered me in providing permission to use their site for the writing of this project.\n\nI would like to thank Prof. Richard Larkin (Leicestershire Zoology) for help with the identification of geese. The collection of photographs taken by Mark and Margaret is also gratefully acknowledged. I would also like to express my sincere thanks to Mark Wilson and to Margaret Smedley for their wonderful advice on taking the photographs.\n\nMarks","token_len":526,"entropy":[2.2159,7.7566,8.2235,6.217,3.7654,4.5273,3.1574,0.2233,1.6999,3.0146,0.25,12.5496,1.6562,11.093,2.9203,3.8625,4.4051,1.8237,6.1916,5.363,3.2773,1.2656,4.2084,0.3038,2.9429,0.1517,1.0747,0.1202,0.0006,0.1495,2.2991,0.2841,6.3905,2.7479,0.0004,0.2252,5.6251,4.031,0.0769,1.1454,5.4377,2.247,1.1902,2.1752,6.1615,5.1836,0.4835,0.9327,0.0965,2.5701,2.0326,2.3702,1.8567,3.2338,3.7559,6.3192,3.5714,2.6501,0.167,0.0158,0.0009,4.5596,5.8638,3.5948,1.4241,3.9337,6.4149,2.285,0.1969,5.4408,1.798,1.5834,5.2527,1.2812,3.7391,4.7716,4.3952,1.2196,0.8697,1.9703,3.7808,1.6541,0.3368,3.6192,2.1204,0.5609,1.1265,0.015,2.5187,1.1863,1.8689,1.9773,0.0016,0.0496,1.0237,1.4161,2.0678,0.676,4.9985,5.6296,3.0263,1.1705,1.6942,0.2951,5.5894,0.0457,2.0323,5.8741,2.175,2.0752,0.0075,3.5248,0.0077,7.972,4.6346,1.6797,0.4703,3.5565,0.9291,5.7602,0.472,5.5431,1.4271,1.8974,1.3299,2.0321,0.1382,5.1248,2.4116,4.7076,0.243,0.8181,3.2318,3.4919,5.6442,0.428,2.4276,0.0021,0.1539,3.7141,1.1048,0.1724,2.1348,0.211,0.0043,0.0838,1.3702,0.852,3.53,0.0002,1.6998,4.2886,1.2425,4.7869,2.1611,2.5124,5.71,0.2922,3.9505,5.0111,0.9494,0.3027,0.0194,4.7817,2.6868,0.0614,0.0033,5.0696,2.0206,2.8324,0.1067,3.8463,4.3271,1.0128,0.0,1.2959,2.0571,1.8312,0.0776,2.9231,1.0246,5.2923,0.9049,2.7314,0.6028,0.2975,0.3039,1.0516,0.0002,3.1472,0.278,2.1753,4.1616,0.0205,0.0468,0.1002,0.0046,0.0168,0.3889,0.9798,4.4608,0.0001,3.2672,3.5178,0.4421,5.439,1.2551,4.6191,1.6328,5.2608,0.73,4.8033,0.1878,4.6118,1.2792,1.5342,2.6234,0.5629,0.27,3.1075,1.3884,1.1118,0.4714,3.0936,3.141,3.6744,0.456,4.6107,1.2114,1.8454,0.6824,2.9558,1.6741,0.8483,1.2399,0.3247,2.8323,0.7847,3.5408,5.1714,0.0145,3.3592,4.7495,1.2462,1.9862,0.3129,6.4894,2.1668,0.0017,4.7935,1.8457,1.0775,0.3289,4.2394,0.0003,0.774,0.9563,1.8401,3.5018,5.6008,1.3589,3.4124,1.4483,2.8344,0.6974,3.8944,0.3234,0.894,1.3231,1.0809,0.6552,0.0063,0.4392,4.9391,0.5513,2.6851,1.2201,3.3881,0.0442,7.6657,2.4867,1.7619,1.2459,0.3324,0.2879,0.9642,0.0034,0.1055,0.4678,1.3194,4.6169,4.101,2.3149,2.0559,4.0324,0.6958,0.3046,2.1168,3.7293,0.9619,5.0989,1.6726,5.9214,3.8402,1.4138,0.591,4.4302,0.1754,0.104,2.3596,5.2672,4.3343,0.1104,0.771,2.8748,5.0366,0.3707,5.0931,0.0439,5.366,0.0567,2.7514,0.4389,1.7698,4.8615,0.4217,5.4,0.456,2.6638,1.2678,2.9219,0.0131,4.4764,6.249,0.3422,3.3708,0.7671,1.5877,0.9485,0.9582,3.8562,3.8206,0.6363,0.0,1.6928,3.3807,3.2398,4.0365,7.5626,0.221,5.4632,2.913,0.1724,0.3518,2.3526,4.1688,1.7822,3.2948,4.774,1.4251,1.41,6.5734,3.0668,0.3684,0.0846,0.9284,0.0026,0.0133,0.1203,3.7076,0.7869,5.2561,0.3111,1.612,2.5933,4.7957,2.7499,1.0613,2.4065,4.2597,0.4171,5.9394,0.6322,2.4149,1.4442,0.449,3.6673,1.5189,0.3071,5.2425,3.8797,1.224,2.3523,1.0623,0.0,2.1463,1.3181,2.2892,0.854,6.0521,6.2401,0.5509,1.6883,3.3907,0.0,1.7414,1.8063,4.3639,0.0156,0.9199,4.2463,0.796,2.7655,3.1589,0.5614,0.5021,0.0002,5.9912,2.4419,4.4234,1.3758,0.1772,1.3271,3.6873,1.2491,0.618,3.3678,0.0071,0.0612,2.6235,0.8261,0.9901,2.4846,4.6674,5.0188,3.3997,2.7585,4.2991,6.0455,0.4665,2.4191,1.3109,2.1881,0.8261,1.6961,5.3822,0.0732,0.1866,3.6126,0.2389,1.2962,0.0002,3.1622,1.5139,0.9119,0.0227,0.6379,5.9245,0.6328,4.1486,4.6977,3.8063,2.4068,5.3208,1.1018,0.0,0.0,2.7343,3.7306,1.267,0.5011,4.7636,0.5933,0.7366,2.6638,0.1306,3.3154,0.0008,1.7211,3.9691,5.1692,0.2409,2.5065,2.145,0.9864,4.8221,4.0785,5.3718,4.5167,2.1203,0.8863,0.0004,0.0525,0.1197,2.5953,0.6206,0.2262,0.0055,0.0062,3.4091,0.0812,2.4885,0.3328,0.0444,3.2667,5.9887,1.9073,3.7689,1.7461,5.9509,4.9093,0.0664,0.397,0.6832,5.8285,3.2698,2.3339,5.9727,1.1469,0.2426,0.5303,0.7148,0.0002,5.6597,3.7219]}

Shortly thereafter, Mike D 'Antonio became the new bassist behind As The Roots Fall with drummer Nick Bair, but Bair left the band shortly thereafter. As The Roots Fall announced their hiatus, Dutkiewicz returned to Overcast for one more tour.\n\nAfter a few more shows with the group, As The Roots Fall announced that Dutkiewicz had signed a solo deal with the label, and the new guitarist returned to Overcast, where he would spend the next few years.\n\nIn April 2006, during the second tour with Overcast, Dutkiewicz announced he would be stepping down from bass for good and asked Bair to play instead. Bair quickly filled in, but never fully replaced his father, who subsequently left Overcast after hearing the news. The band returned two months later with the now former Dutkiewicz bassist and Bair drumming, marking the end of the Overcast era.\n\nFollowing that period, the group continued to tour. The members briefly reunited in 2008 after three years of hiatus, but this time went back-to-back-to-back with a full band. The band went on hiatus again in 2011, but announced that they would be touring this summer.\n\nAs the rootsy, alternative hardcore band, As The Roots Fall announced that they would be taking the stage in an acoustic setting for their June 2011 concert at the White Oak Music Hall (June 10, 7:45pm).\n\nDutkiewicz released his first solo album, \"One More Day,\" in August 2012. The record was recorded at the Blue Moon Recording Facilities in Los Angeles. Dutkiewicz said the new album marks a major change for him.\n\nIn an interview with Guitar World, Dutkiewicz said The Roots Fall has had one goal: \"What should be a cool, unique experience for people, now we're getting over the hump and really trying to entertain people.\"","token_len":526,"entropy":[11.0034,0.6314,0.1281,11.4739,6.8103,0.6456,3.1747,0.2613,0.0148,6.9413,0.0725,3.3274,7.265,6.4545,0.2652,5.2626,2.5498,1.4517,4.8011,0.5089,3.255,6.5141,0.0584,2.7267,0.0426,1.1397,4.1189,0.1471,4.9912,0.0192,3.1631,3.8544,8.6201,6.9802,2.6292,0.0983,14.0711,0.1824,5.9892,0.0148,1.8101,5.0126,2.6176,4.2326,0.12,0.0015,2.8711,1.9722,0.0074,0.0035,0.0033,2.6989,3.6489,3.492,0.0718,5.5964,3.6866,3.9051,0.1061,4.1863,1.2096,6.584,0.0881,0.3873,0.0026,5.1023,5.4445,0.5752,0.0256,0.0023,3.3481,2.2932,6.3792,2.5397,4.9292,2.9698,0.0372,1.4889,5.0809,0.7549,0.0435,0.0155,0.0033,0.3351,5.4196,2.5907,0.0001,0.3761,2.0119,0.0013,2.4249,1.4755,0.1622,4.9243,0.1839,0.0116,0.0058,0.0009,3.8566,1.9306,0.0062,3.5387,5.9164,4.0375,4.3293,1.0696,2.3087,1.7131,5.9103,2.5844,1.2797,0.6163,4.0604,0.4359,2.544,3.8156,4.0166,0.0014,1.3987,3.6716,1.2526,2.9523,5.198,4.6246,0.547,0.513,4.7879,0.9514,0.0836,2.704,0.0483,2.5153,0.0014,0.0011,0.0002,5.0437,0.9689,1.6565,0.7393,0.0995,6.4222,6.6837,4.5679,2.8888,3.2502,4.4392,4.0229,5.0501,4.6045,4.5301,2.2763,3.598,4.1673,0.0013,0.8415,0.6234,0.2927,2.1872,0.782,0.3814,3.7576,0.4755,0.0031,0.0654,5.8689,1.2527,3.6385,1.5558,1.6724,0.0028,0.0023,0.001,3.0804,0.1782,1.4574,0.0015,3.659,3.6305,1.0492,0.4057,1.4286,1.1475,0.0002,2.2028,2.2677,2.2775,2.7586,3.5252,2.0312,1.9866,2.3425,0.2405,3.294,0.0213,0.0009,0.026,1.4157,1.7776,1.8895,0.0015,0.0015,0.001,1.2334,4.8064,1.6913,2.0115,0.6294,0.3036,3.6412,1.2816,2.3516,1.8297,1.7432,3.9034,5.1667,3.9937,0.0947,1.0482,0.0021,3.1176,2.4285,0.255,3.0279,3.5455,0.3131,0.4943,1.8828,0.0351,1.0665,1.7316,0.0002,1.729,4.0926,2.3291,0.0285,6.4379,1.3317,4.1202,1.976,0.8754,2.3893,0.0053,0.1729,0.6148,0.0019,0.0023,0.0009,3.0334,2.2099,1.8298,0.6913,3.9071,0.7216,0.2129,3.9284,2.1438,1.2953,1.7991,4.3992,2.7455,0.001,0.2286,3.1673,4.5477,0.1336,1.4494,0.0007,4.6352,3.9452,0.3361,1.737,2.0276,6.0857,3.2577,2.1328,3.988,5.0825,2.0115,0.7255,6.2733,2.1572,1.3965,0.0013,3.5966,5.5319,1.6395,0.2151,0.1664,3.3519,0.8452,4.2186,6.8084,0.6483,0.011,0.8411,2.6815,5.0921,4.9998,1.8716,0.0044,0.003,0.0052,2.0698,0.134,3.1717,1.6486,0.0012,3.6272,0.0107,2.166,5.8908,0.3645,2.0577,0.0311,0.9479,2.8052,0.0049,0.491,0.1849,0.3004,0.0002,3.5185,4.3051,4.827,0.4548,1.7204,2.2181,3.6408,0.5482,0.9976,4.0025,2.6609,4.2959,5.788,0.3199,0.722,1.7181,4.0415,5.5498,0.166,1.0257,1.8683,0.9405,1.2506,4.3731,0.9447,5.8869,1.8078,4.3299,0.0226,0.0011,0.149,3.8736,0.0374,0.0384,0.0078,0.7397,2.2981,2.8734,1.5741,0.8681,1.9241,1.4919,4.0615,0.1594,1.5471,0.5768,0.4997,1.5093,0.8328,1.1904,2.9244,2.3373,0.4761,0.4817,1.0968,3.1298,4.1895,1.7322,0.8623,0.8675,0.0002,3.0233,1.4276,4.0853,4.7193,2.4848,3.5698,4.82,0.8208,3.0752,1.2195,0.1406,0.0011,0.0061,6.0571,2.1555,0.387,0.4332,0.514,3.6239,3.0421,1.0645,1.7631,5.2578,3.0079,0.7415,1.5419,0.8945,3.9836,4.6296,2.0168,1.0998,0.8546,5.9653,0.8084,0.3881,0.0625,5.649,5.2339,3.3888,1.2052,4.0652,0.7382,3.7545,2.3627,0.3778,1.9038,0.0002,3.8458,0.1006,0.0025,0.0016,3.5184,0.7162,1.2216,0.0868,0.4851,0.3322,0.2258,5.7059,2.3671,2.8874,0.46,0.4918,3.5182,1.388,0.5184,1.1969,3.0238,1.0533,1.2325,1.6394,1.6549,4.7875,3.7477,1.6761,8.2973,0.3815,4.4704,0.0113,1.5236,2.7981,0.002,0.0027,0.0015,3.9121,2.0635,3.7798,0.4386,5.5637,1.5639,3.8293,1.7224,1.4548,1.3786,1.5966,0.7375,0.0002,3.2759,2.8338,0.0832,0.2066,4.7596,0.1825,0.5848,0.2621,0.0028,0.0028,0.0007,0.6688,6.894,0.0319,0.0959,3.1427,3.9038,4.8392,1.4857,2.6399,0.7356,5.7224,6.5614,1.5341,2.2489,5.1329,1.3249,4.3114,2.6124,0.6706,2.2876,2.3844,5.3263,2.1936,1.0531,3.6249,6.5873,1.2547,1.0555,1.3654,4.6009,2.998,0.0263,5.6684,0.4118,1.1754]}
{"id":1080,"ended":false,"length":491,"gen_text":"As stated in the preface, there is a code hidden in the paintings throughout the book. This was an idea of Brett < unk > and Balliett's editor, Tracy Mack.\nBrett says that in the \"inner sanctum\" (the room where the painting was seen) there is a hidden room that should never be shown in a book that's supposed to be a \"how to\" guide on creating those paintings using Photoshop. Here are some screengrabs [ click to embiggen ]\nIt is a very high resolution image where he shows the difference between these two images.\nAs already mentioned, the first one was uploaded with the brush tool set to default setting (I forgot how to do this but for those who are into that, see note 4 in the readme file for details ). In the second screen grab, the screen shows what the editor has used in the second file to get the final paint job.\nHere are some screengrabs showing the brush tool settings used with Photoshop, as well as the default settings and the difference\nIn addition, he has included the original PNG.TIF files found in the chapter in this link: http:\/\/www.mediafire.com\/?dw1k8v2i75f9kpx (found in the chapter where the painting is seen. When you open these files, they can be modified only by the owner, so do not go looking for free stuff on the web ;-)\nBrett's hope is that if the book is successful in getting enough traction, it can then be published in other languages. The first language he wants it to be translated into is Spanish, because of his strong interest in that country. The book will be translated by a Portuguese professional who also speaks French, German and Spanish. Brett is also planning to create a French version of the book, which should be available sometime in 2011. Brett is planning to publish the final book in English next year. He also wants to release a free version of the book during the same year (I am not sure about the release date, due to the fact that Brett will have to work a lot more over the coming months to get the final book translated and ready). I would like to thank Brett for his hard work! I am definitely looking forward to seeing this book being properly translated. He is currently working very hard to meet those goals and I wish him the best! Please remember that a donation doesn't make me anything but a little better (I don't work full time anymore) but it does help with running, printing and hosting my site ;)","token_len":527,"entropy":[6.7236,1.2419,0.6189,5.1219,1.0703,0.5401,3.8197,1.3308,1.2958,8.3775,7.314,0.783,0.6339,9.8128,7.4905,0.3571,2.6592,0.8745,2.4017,5.1153,3.9781,2.258,3.0954,8.5414,12.3867,12.5357,2.8375,4.0648,2.0554,12.1966,5.8961,1.6807,6.248,7.8067,0.9932,7.5441,6.9276,1.9272,2.3113,8.2831,0.0381,4.5664,1.5403,4.1379,1.0866,4.2343,6.2962,2.0186,0.0317,0.37,2.6874,1.6201,2.6794,1.25,0.5481,2.9607,1.5226,5.7481,1.0916,0.7649,0.8201,0.2159,3.1435,3.1976,1.9942,5.6796,4.1887,0.173,3.7016,1.6886,1.5186,1.8715,4.9381,3.3876,3.1812,0.0038,0.1879,1.8671,2.4128,5.1685,0.6662,0.4501,1.2936,3.0064,3.9636,6.1336,0.8749,6.2881,2.2837,0.3226,4.1119,2.5679,1.1932,4.9114,2.9762,0.0001,7.2939,4.7041,0.8885,2.4109,0.0031,0.0002,0.4093,1.5394,3.8781,1.8356,1.6743,3.3818,5.4309,0.6808,1.1584,6.18,6.1065,2.6585,1.2491,5.8114,0.4424,5.7436,0.7212,1.5654,0.9042,1.3027,3.5642,6.3591,0.887,0.3304,1.322,3.3877,2.2949,1.9892,6.3686,3.6747,1.1996,5.8875,0.6251,2.4757,0.2411,5.0346,3.8726,2.0728,4.4026,5.4705,3.939,0.6818,2.5986,1.093,3.9107,5.8357,1.9293,0.6662,2.0726,4.5767,1.5191,1.2604,4.5561,6.1598,3.9972,1.3662,0.3,5.3727,0.0271,1.7717,3.6665,2.7191,3.6113,3.6621,1.067,0.5772,4.359,3.703,0.5512,1.2774,6.7763,5.9098,3.4881,1.4991,5.2057,3.9381,4.6502,2.4258,0.8622,3.547,5.8667,2.007,3.3692,0.432,3.5381,5.438,2.3575,0.5139,0.7096,3.2235,1.2531,0.7689,1.2873,0.0417,0.0011,3.0101,0.7382,3.0448,0.8736,1.8695,2.9571,4.6398,1.9835,4.1847,2.8857,0.8754,0.0296,1.0017,3.041,0.9399,3.9534,0.8385,5.4345,4.1406,2.677,3.1708,0.8471,3.3147,2.0607,2.729,2.3128,2.5327,5.2516,6.5357,6.5833,1.0786,2.3583,6.4066,0.337,0.2251,6.7419,3.9492,4.3999,3.3287,1.8908,1.5628,0.0029,0.6324,0.0135,2.684,0.0017,0.0092,0.0011,0.3902,3.8067,3.33,3.1999,3.5861,3.2209,3.8905,3.2578,4.5369,6.0592,3.9765,3.047,3.5731,7.6685,3.5823,4.8864,0.8303,0.5569,1.9804,4.3713,0.4436,1.1251,0.7788,0.9849,4.1752,5.9811,1.1187,0.8894,2.3936,0.6763,0.5719,1.4393,4.4629,0.2588,4.6797,5.7904,1.3473,1.032,5.1329,2.9027,1.2122,3.7617,0.3159,4.5049,3.1406,0.15,5.7798,4.5118,1.9902,0.4128,1.5805,6.4489,0.8945,1.1816,3.3756,0.0152,2.1437,5.2207,0.2925,0.1504,3.3443,2.335,1.9437,0.6235,2.7782,2.6689,1.5466,3.0871,4.4502,0.9959,2.7625,2.3396,4.198,0.3742,2.2555,1.9509,1.7776,0.9255,1.1627,3.1731,3.0539,2.0195,1.1722,2.7822,3.2438,0.7009,0.1205,1.1111,0.3314,0.1804,1.8581,1.1213,2.2919,3.7843,1.7609,4.0174,2.4722,0.0905,1.8561,1.7719,0.5116,3.1037,1.9497,1.2621,0.6922,3.6725,2.1721,2.5861,5.4378,5.2531,2.0277,3.2888,3.5364,3.6682,1.4785,1.4457,1.0406,1.6974,0.4,2.818,1.9884,1.1922,2.2453,0.4067,3.4515,0.4739,3.1915,0.9663,1.08,0.2186,0.0943,1.1512,2.0046,2.0328,0.4157,1.4529,3.5021,0.6692,4.2325,0.3048,3.28,1.7695,3.7623,0.2737,3.0282,0.8456,5.5643,1.1954,0.899,2.5465,5.1116,0.4476,0.683,2.9528,2.142,2.0726,0.0852,3.0204,1.0729,3.0262,2.423,0.4311,0.3021,0.2097,6.7683,0.5492,3.9082,1.0371,3.0436,3.9769,2.9015,1.0994,0.1698,2.3563,0.8372,2.1875,0.4788,1.7672,5.7088,0.0084,0.7599,1.1729,0.0728,2.2129,3.2913,1.5534,0.1663,2.7561,2.1997,0.4263,3.0538,5.6245,0.2166,2.6463,0.5678,1.7453,1.6034,0.6353,3.1341,1.1211,4.1841,0.8359,2.4005,2.1382,3.5091,2.7485,0.9226,0.0319,0.5065,0.1402,0.336,1.3608,3.2629,0.0243,4.2805,2.1968,2.2335,5.309,1.0515,0.0095,0.0296,2.6107,2.1439,0.3507,4.0567,7.2353,0.7616,2.0418,4.8937,1.7003,3.6572,0.9232,5.2232,0.0855,0.9246,4.9152,4.3632,1.9721,2.1432,1.2314,3.5636,0.0689,1.0882,0.1082,1.9783,5.0049,4.622,0.5894,5.03,2.8049,5.3413,0.0009,3.0939,1.4384,4.2425,2.8117,0.8549,2.513,3.7867,3.8701,2.3087,2.4037,0.0006,3.7872,2.8861,0.5571,4.0492,2.4788,1.5932,0.7095,1.2515,0.9119,3.7755,5.2723,6.8202,2.4413,0.5768,4.6158,3.0387,2.0193,5.5513]}
{"id":771,"ended":false,"length":441,"gen_text":"A number of characters from past Crash Bandicoot games return in Crash Boom Bang!, though only eight are playable. The playable characters include Crash Bandicoot, Coco Bandicoot, Crunch Bandicoot, Tails Bandicoot, and Foxy Bandicoot. The Crash Bandicoot amiibo supports all characters from the Crash series across platforms.\n\nThe game's soundtrack is composed by John Pritchard.\n\nStory\n\nWith the help of Dr. N., Crash and Coco have to solve puzzles using their acrobatic fighting skills and gadgets. Crash is trying to rescue Peach, Coco is trying to stop Dr. N. from taking control of Cortex, and Foxy Bandicoot is trying to stop Cortex's plan. Foxy Bandicoot's gadgets such as throwing things through his enemies or launching Foxy Bandicoot himself, can be controlled while in the air giving players the option to jump around, strike enemies, grab objects, and complete some puzzles. Foxy Bandicoot throws barrels, boxes, and bombs using his arms, which can also be controlled. Crash's acrobatic skills also come into play, as he is capable of moving and jumping in mid-air to avoid some of the obstacles that Foxy Bandicoot is attempting to use. He is also able to dodge enemy attacks through the use of his agility, which is further enhanced by the use of his acrobatic moves.\n\nAs characters play through the game, they earn experience. Crash Bandicoot's acrobatic skills will increase while Foxy Bandicoot's gadgets will decrease. When a player finishes an objective, they will receive a number of points that determines their rank on the leaderboard. The ranks will depend on the amount of points obtained on each objective, as well as the difficulty levels of each. One rank can be obtained at the very beginning of the game as a tutorial.\n\nThe GameCube release features a multiplayer mode, similar to that of Crash Tag Team Racing. Players can select two of their friends, where the two can compete with each other, as well as their friends, for the lowest score possible in the three different game modes.\n\nGallery\n\nConcept art Crash Bandicoot (left) and Coco Bandicoot (right) Concept art Crash as he appears in the teaser page of the originalCrash Bandicoot.

{"id":1460,"ended":true,"length":477,"gen_text":"In deposit, the spores appear brown. Viewing them with a light microscope reveals finer details of their structure : they are roughly spherical but end abruptly in a small point, their surfaces are rough and almost featureless, and their walls are shiny. Their flat shape, lack of any walls and uniform smooth surface makes them an attractive specimen to identify for identification of the mushroom spores.\n\nThis species displays other features such as flat surface and rough surface, which are all present and visible when examined under a light microscope. Although the mushroom spores bear resemblance to Amanita spp., they were actually collected from another mushroom, Amanita caerulescens ( A. caerulescens ), which is very common but is only edible by some species of small birds. A. sanguinolentum has more than 40 species found in North America with the most prominent group being the North American members. The European members are very rare but are found in some places such as the Swiss Alps.\n\n\nI have never found this species in my local nursery. It probably escapes us because of the fact that it grows in very large, open places in the forest or open fields. This species is not in a good breeding condition. There are about 5 or 6 species (including this one) found living in the North American woods, near roads, in old fields and so on. These species inhabit habitats ranging from drier conditions to very moist areas.\n\n\nThere are no published descriptions of this species in North America but there is one in Europe. A. caerulescens is the more widespread mushroom in Europe, but this one is extremely rare and most likely exists nowhere else. If you wish to grow this species then you can cultivate it using a regular soil, a dark substrate and a fruiting light. You should never use any artificial fungi in this species. You can grow this species using fresh or dried mycelium, but never from spores. The spores must be cut from the mushroom by cutting them with a kitchen knife, cutting the cap at least 1\/4 cm thick, then gently removing the cap for storage. The spores are quite easy to identify, because of their flat surface and rough surface.\n\n\nIt would be useful if you could see a collection of A. caerulescens spores. For instance, my collection of 50 spore prints was located several years ago beside a stream in the Swiss Alps near a road, now partially dried out. One of the spore prints is described in \"Species of A. caerulescens\" in my book Fungi of North America.","token_len":530,"entropy":[13.7419,3.5012,1.9008,12.3936,5.8675,6.1118,2.9768,9.016,3.3786,2.2067,3.7862,0.5972,2.8188,0.7666,1.3743,9.3723,3.26,1.4534,2.4381,1.5863,9.5547,3.2071,0.5007,5.5907,0.9423,4.5601,7.5732,3.8334,1.7447,0.4828,3.6272,2.8813,1.9439,4.8071,3.3219,0.6728,2.6754,0.6983,5.1379,5.3835,0.0002,0.6483,0.4534,1.2167,3.3903,0.1995,5.8409,0.6383,4.0833,5.3875,4.4059,2.9847,3.7425,0.0018,3.0263,4.9128,1.6686,6.3063,3.683,0.5469,3.3889,0.397,4.1352,2.3979,3.4555,2.2357,4.4641,3.9879,2.4311,2.7386,2.0297,4.0312,4.4818,0.4594,1.0363,0.0534,4.531,2.0165,6.7691,5.6238,2.616,3.9997,0.0134,5.5927,3.8123,1.4979,3.859,0.9946,1.218,2.553,1.6834,4.5613,4.6132,3.7766,3.5538,2.6626,3.3307,0.8842,0.3443,0.8701,0.0067,0.1944,5.7415,1.3885,3.6703,2.4853,6.6442,3.4542,0.068,4.531,0.0245,4.265,0.0423,0.723,1.2792,5.0248,3.8774,0.6472,0.3279,3.8232,2.6321,1.3348,1.6136,0.0243,4.3249,0.5987,0.05,0.0217,0.0,2.1512,8.0021,0.2219,0.9411,0.0136,0.0135,0.0063,0.0004,1.8935,0.7514,0.7911,3.5844,3.2006,4.9661,2.3631,4.6076,5.5253,2.7732,2.37,3.6985,0.1779,5.5118,2.6458,0.8265,4.7149,0.7245,1.6745,5.0876,1.1697,0.7412,0.0892,1.6407,2.4098,4.2336,3.372,4.0579,0.9354,4.1831,0.4697,2.089,0.0759,4.2254,1.9649,1.1373,4.0992,5.1868,0.703,1.4079,3.8923,0.0531,5.7759,2.2526,2.1358,4.8141,1.9081,0.6906,3.2604,0.8328,3.406,1.5545,3.162,0.5041,2.9871,3.2122,2.2326,0.0071,1.6473,4.7484,0.2391,0.8898,3.6006,0.0003,5.1794,1.7054,3.5023,2.6373,1.637,0.9683,1.0101,1.328,3.6958,5.3809,1.8594,1.8229,5.5874,5.3362,4.8678,1.1606,1.8337,1.21,3.5955,0.0764,0.5511,2.3521,1.111,2.9685,3.9077,3.3488,1.5978,3.3439,2.8919,1.1634,1.7254,3.9357,3.8507,1.6246,0.6348,3.4392,0.9617,0.9116,2.4844,4.5813,3.7379,1.8243,4.7628,0.8936,1.4552,4.1326,0.7011,4.2505,3.5127,2.9877,0.1982,2.2,4.9641,2.7507,1.3308,0.0801,0.1041,3.5283,6.7349,0.3406,1.2277,4.341,0.4714,3.7129,1.9201,6.7655,2.6461,1.1575,1.722,3.8785,1.2054,1.0145,3.7112,0.2042,0.1768,3.637,1.0731,6.2492,5.5192,3.0818,0.0643,5.7849,0.0129,5.2021,0.8519,1.676,1.5366,2.4113,0.5819,2.4041,0.0003,3.8578,0.4449,3.0647,4.446,2.4988,0.4063,0.2076,0.2901,1.8601,2.1279,0.4218,3.3327,2.3543,1.2788,1.2348,1.2454,0.4585,0.7287,3.2741,0.6748,1.6278,0.0035,0.0055,0.0099,0.0017,0.9055,2.6816,3.6956,3.7481,2.8399,1.8727,0.3829,1.9774,1.6115,1.8505,1.7643,0.6361,5.8704,0.2729,1.5334,5.1505,0.743,5.8677,2.5249,1.2253,1.2105,4.7029,0.291,3.2068,0.0444,3.0596,0.4415,0.9242,5.1905,1.1161,2.7793,5.8845,0.3331,4.759,1.4601,5.4762,3.6734,3.3234,3.0013,5.5681,1.6937,0.8052,1.1048,4.3379,0.001,5.3904,0.7062,3.123,2.2045,3.7585,1.1751,3.3695,3.7749,7.4145,2.0494,1.9949,2.3834,1.3592,3.4018,0.8135,1.4945,0.999,0.7735,3.5819,4.6513,1.1359,0.3219,4.3315,0.0486,0.0707,2.0781,1.256,3.6684,4.9501,1.1886,0.3632,2.4258,2.6282,2.5381,0.2083,5.3445,1.0422,0.4229,1.2729,3.2145,2.1638,2.3543,1.525,0.2053,5.4332,0.0614,2.4091,3.2433,1.7346,1.9036,3.9327,3.3615,2.3585,1.2257,1.0098,4.9546,3.7327,1.802,2.1161,4.4687,2.9734,0.1971,0.814,6.7516,3.3075,0.3748,2.2654,3.3418,1.6404,4.0475,3.5967,0.0112,3.4265,2.3068,3.4023,2.5029,0.5423,2.7146,1.0531,0.4642,0.7478,0.2775,0.4004,1.4075,0.0003,3.7978,4.7976,0.3234,3.8293,1.6526,1.043,0.3837,5.2656,2.1296,5.5784,0.204,2.6035,0.0095,0.6392,0.0018,0.0023,0.003,0.0015,3.5326,1.56,5.132,4.7191,0.2245,4.9467,2.0749,1.9294,4.1536,3.66,0.0152,0.3321,1.8066,4.5564,6.8774,0.569,0.0167,8.3201,0.6208,2.3609,0.5487,1.4131,1.7535,0.0668,3.1103,2.9465,2.9505,2.7861,5.86,4.4722,3.2161,1.1234,0.366,5.1541,0.8089,0.2897,2.631,0.0183,0.082,2.4265,5.2697,1.2604,3.1859,5.225,0.063,0.8053,3.7725,0.2557,0.3325,0.0019,0.0027,0.0016,0.0011,1.3418,3.0857,4.3553,1.0966,5.174,0.0108,0.0339,0.0762,0.5223,0.0274,1.1246]}
{"id":3913,"ended":true,"length":499,"gen_text":"Horace Holly \u2013 protagonist and narrator, Holly is a Cambridge man whose keen intellect and knowledge was developed to compensate for his ape @ - @ like appearance. Holly knows a number of obscure 'facts' that are the true basis of the story. The story centres around his quest to find and investigate the meaning behind the 'facts' he's 'know'. The story is not a comedy, and the characters are not 'furry' or ridiculous.\n\n\nThe characters and their backgrounds are interesting. They are diverse, and each have their own problems, concerns and personality characteristics. The cast is diverse in appearance and background, being one member of the 'Furry' character.\n\n\nI could have done with a few more characters, since the main plot is quite slow. The characters come to life faster than I had anticipated. As a storyteller, I did find it amusing, but as a reader, I feel that its a bit 'boingy' and light weight.\n\n\nDespite its light, comical nature, Holly also has some interesting ideas, and its some of the key ideas. Holly's story may be based on a fictional account of a real event, but its not some kind of a hoax. There are so many aspects to the story that I feel its a bit odd the way it is written. When I finished, which was a long time, I feel there were parts of the story that seemed to just pop in without any real thought. This is something that I would personally take issue with. Holly must have had a decent idea of what he was doing, but that isn't always the case.\n\n\nThe ending of Holly is interesting, especially when you compare it to other fictions. It gives a satisfying conclusion without feeling rushed and without too many unanswered questions. It leaves me wanting more, which I am sure is a good sign. I am glad that my review is balanced in its review. The review will be read by one reader for this book ( I'm a sucker for good reviews ).\n\n\nI am also grateful for the'reviewer' of this book, for providing me with an opportunity to read a book, which I had not read before. This has me considering revisiting many of My favourites and reading them again. I'll also be re-reading 'Wolves'.\n\n\nThis book was fun and engaging though I could see that it could have been written much better, if the author had had to make a number of compromises in order to make it work. I'm sure that it took quite, a long time to write, but it was fun to read.","token_len":531,"entropy":[5.3775,10.8702,6.2391,11.8496,3.0464,3.3297,2.9024,5.8888,1.1637,0.7024,10.5805,4.6643,3.1778,8.2873,2.0668,0.8609,5.8837,7.7445,5.0024,4.2637,6.5061,0.0525,0.4576,12.137,15.9011,6.2464,13.0536,7.7197,1.8266,0.3151,2.9525,5.8181,2.3912,4.4175,0.0065,3.9067,6.022,2.9478,0.2117,2.3727,2.2254,4.461,5.7126,2.4432,0.5396,2.0373,2.3019,1.0004,2.6201,2.1142,5.1962,0.4181,1.6713,3.2196,0.312,1.6029,3.2896,4.6041,0.8844,5.0833,1.4294,1.0649,2.5256,0.7732,0.9063,1.2153,3.1142,3.9762,2.8257,2.2801,2.1913,1.3796,0.9653,4.4448,2.0632,4.4304,1.1483,2.7248,1.8496,2.5429,0.45,1.208,3.4007,3.6691,3.9078,1.1444,1.3509,5.324,0.5026,3.5162,0.0003,2.0985,4.1712,3.3221,1.9074,3.968,0.4619,3.8217,1.9269,2.1063,0.8588,4.9372,1.2512,1.27,3.0622,1.8777,0.5619,0.0897,4.475,1.8791,4.4535,0.4845,5.6415,4.379,0.1677,1.6121,5.4177,1.0414,2.6942,2.3408,3.415,1.4614,2.5394,1.0104,6.0413,5.3781,5.8919,0.304,1.1456,2.1846,4.2682,0.6913,1.0832,5.5631,2.9531,1.5926,0.0002,2.7576,5.9035,2.8336,1.4266,0.9912,0.8553,2.096,0.156,2.0742,0.9483,5.9555,1.0625,3.351,3.0162,1.1803,2.7616,3.268,1.4607,1.7809,2.6012,5.2978,1.5056,0.3219,5.9229,1.1898,2.3148,3.0755,1.6653,1.0564,4.8493,1.4856,3.469,2.3848,0.0005,0.3083,0.7615,3.8373,1.8024,1.8885,5.567,2.6717,1.2505,2.3025,0.1851,0.1054,0.4913,0.469,4.7584,1.3285,7.1023,3.035,0.6911,3.2955,5.314,3.0799,0.8457,0.8311,1.1159,5.2797,6.0489,0.6202,1.068,0.0002,5.0384,2.2197,3.2953,3.9737,4.6714,0.0361,1.3551,0.0785,3.4465,4.7016,0.8974,1.7232,3.8578,2.4116,2.1269,1.0252,4.1792,5.9349,0.5576,0.2701,6.1102,1.3406,6.0316,3.1067,1.6855,3.0991,4.7645,1.122,4.9803,0.2768,1.4319,4.9414,2.7812,1.3861,1.0842,1.3757,1.7321,0.2591,0.2922,2.2034,2.3137,5.7402,3.8072,0.0057,4.2814,3.5042,0.4606,3.2865,0.8762,5.4159,0.0242,3.8956,1.215,0.6775,0.3033,0.8223,1.5207,2.6175,3.476,2.2792,3.0998,5.6535,4.5933,3.1717,0.9271,1.4248,1.8494,0.5212,6.0237,1.3707,3.1279,1.9864,7.7221,0.7406,1.859,1.8335,0.121,1.3469,0.2114,6.2585,3.6241,1.4742,3.7738,1.0523,0.2979,0.2303,0.4056,4.5733,1.456,4.8114,4.1318,1.3174,4.0609,1.2374,1.3849,2.3527,1.3408,3.4896,1.4933,3.1748,0.7069,1.0284,1.953,5.0059,5.2539,0.5165,0.0229,1.3155,4.2369,6.5026,0.3274,1.3923,0.7707,5.3617,2.3008,0.7352,0.9978,0.2853,0.5026,0.8275,0.5701,1.284,4.5356,4.0003,0.0012,1.0643,0.2724,0.014,0.4067,0.6998,0.0002,1.7855,2.7671,1.6033,1.6264,1.5817,3.3001,0.8694,4.6967,2.1746,1.1115,3.3256,0.2092,0.2479,2.1697,2.327,0.5107,1.1211,2.0627,4.718,1.165,3.9896,0.9672,4.0142,2.7609,2.3514,3.0881,2.0677,4.2302,1.0433,3.1829,0.0228,0.1669,2.412,3.048,1.9528,1.267,0.3936,0.9081,2.7828,1.4831,2.8668,1.4222,1.5833,2.5692,1.4608,1.1661,0.7484,2.0612,2.7428,2.3338,1.0704,4.5608,2.1956,2.3857,5.6987,2.5898,2.9228,3.1415,1.4436,3.0477,3.5067,4.1736,1.2343,5.6071,0.9686,5.0991,3.2366,5.9242,2.6711,1.4637,4.6127,6.8298,2.6949,2.4679,4.9351,0.0881,2.1989,0.3837,2.7337,1.2272,0.0003,1.5649,3.1273,3.899,3.7195,1.1579,0.5847,14.0748,4.6588,1.1314,0.7706,3.8172,1.1883,0.6164,1.4538,3.3476,3.8901,0.8828,0.1077,2.0076,1.7724,0.0334,2.461,1.8596,1.4591,2.7267,2.1428,0.7115,2.7651,1.0481,0.9703,0.5442,0.353,3.2374,4.1482,5.4016,4.3621,5.5392,0.0016,4.9824,0.641,9.4055,3.5082,3.6891,2.7377,1.2005,0.4484,0.6036,1.6827,3.8376,2.9442,0.4612,3.1339,0.4996,0.0847,3.9097,4.6548,3.8334,4.0994,1.3713,0.0002,3.2933,1.3778,1.5466,4.4455,1.9011,3.6291,7.1835,1.6764,4.2276,1.9987,1.7699,0.9941,1.0851,0.3202,0.331,2.8397,1.8926,0.2292,2.614,3.6332,2.161,0.3698,0.3425,2.8372,4.8737,3.0945,2.3269,1.7435,0.0093,3.3103,1.8946,0.497,0.0522,1.6264,0.7521,1.2068,0.3823,1.7736,2.9375,1.945,1.0754,2.8211,5.8032,4.1843,10.2106,1.6256,1.9755,0.0547,0.3449,0.3461,0.8358,1.7616,1.6287,1.1421,3.6572,1.0023,0.0673,0.5779]}
{"id":1819,"ended":true,"length":500,"gen_text":"The cell nucleus contains the majority of the cell's genetic material in the form of multiple linear DNA molecules organized into structures called chromosomes. Each human cell contains roughly two meters of DNA, and each chromosome in a human cell is encoded by approximately 1.3 billion base pairs -- so if you doubled the number of copies of each chromosome in a cell, that's roughly what it would take to double the number of DNA letters.\n\nAnother important component of cell nucleus is the mitochondria. This microscopic organelle inside each cell is what allows our body to produce energy from glucose (a sugar) and oxygen (a gas). As we eat food and drink fluids, these tiny organelles extract their energy from the food we eat and expel it into the environment with the aid of oxygen atoms. If any one of these mitochondria were to fail, our whole body would be harmed. Mitochondria are found in every adult cell in our body but are especially abundant in our older and sicker cells. They are, however, not normally a problem except when they are broken down and made less efficient.\n\nMitochondria make up 2 percent of our cell's DNA and when a cell divides, mitochondria break down and accumulate inside the daughter cells. When a cell divides, most of its DNA (which is comprised of one hundred billion base pairs of DNA which is two meters in length) is replaced with these daughter cells. This 'half-DNA' gives newly divided cells an approximate chance to duplicate the existing 50 percent of DNA (known as 'base pair' composition) as they divide. New cell division can even occur without DNA replication and will only occur if mitosis (cell division) does not proceed naturally. Thus, mitosis gives birth to new cells without cell division, as in this case.\n\nNow, while a child has all their DNA inside their DNA molecule, when a person dies cells do not go extinct but are 'de-extinct' or 'de-evolved'. They are replaced with other cells whose DNA is replaced entirely, allowing only the most basic DNA, which is found in every cell, to remain in the genome; and, it is that minimal DNA that gives us our genetic identity. So, while we have a lot of DNA in our DNA molecule, it is only a fraction of our genetic material: we have just 1 percent of our entire hereditary code written in our DNA molecules. When we go on the DL we will not have inherited the complete genetic code of our mother or grandfather or father, but only the fraction who, by chance, happened to survive to see us develop into adults.","token_len":531,"entropy":[9.5621,7.2411,3.07,1.3467,3.5584,0.0193,0.7466,2.3497,0.0653,1.3301,0.4347,5.5769,1.418,0.412,0.0018,8.5813,7.1756,3.1591,0.8855,6.8515,0.6179,6.5656,0.2971,0.2904,0.2596,2.506,6.5046,0.3752,1.1414,3.8541,3.8482,6.6007,0.4445,0.296,1.0875,2.0683,1.6087,0.715,4.1997,1.0613,0.8769,0.5001,1.2551,5.585,0.6563,3.0057,2.8448,1.4509,2.2599,0.8888,0.5309,0.0155,6.4916,5.3393,3.8715,0.7843,5.5766,0.265,1.2884,0.0162,5.46,0.3931,1.0716,0.7691,1.3902,0.5568,1.1739,0.1341,3.1199,1.902,2.3156,4.4298,2.4796,0.1558,0.1909,0.1009,0.5114,0.1252,1.0685,0.0057,2.3644,2.39,1.3733,0.7777,0.0007,5.9287,2.4723,2.7707,0.086,4.4721,4.3417,0.9089,0.41,1.1436,0.2887,1.3071,3.9505,5.3468,0.144,0.0303,4.1672,1.8528,0.455,1.2217,4.9724,2.5931,3.8916,2.6105,0.1498,1.4617,0.2096,2.4818,3.119,1.9976,2.2102,1.6108,0.7856,0.803,0.6129,0.3904,0.6639,0.3196,0.2489,4.5696,2.8083,4.6719,2.1509,1.6192,2.0912,2.1626,0.2508,3.9491,1.457,0.4681,0.004,0.0001,3.9386,4.2672,0.584,0.3823,0.714,0.8923,2.4459,0.3893,0.4904,3.8708,0.7241,1.6161,0.389,2.9657,5.8011,0.4663,3.3544,0.0029,2.0648,4.7846,0.4905,4.3157,4.4865,3.1421,0.1823,0.3462,2.4408,0.0095,1.3867,0.2489,2.2902,0.2011,1.7107,4.2646,0.5014,0.352,1.9122,5.0601,0.5054,2.8569,0.0005,0.0551,0.7213,4.1431,0.6109,1.1496,5.3692,1.1411,1.5341,1.1463,0.3732,4.9719,1.077,2.0887,1.1962,0.0674,1.5619,5.2516,2.9967,2.0851,1.4738,0.2322,0.254,3.1872,0.8723,5.6048,1.0688,0.0039,2.8576,4.4796,4.4468,0.9059,4.9437,1.3263,0.7843,0.9077,4.372,1.1833,1.8212,5.8713,3.9749,0.8654,1.1064,0.735,0.0002,3.2587,0.0031,0.2149,5.1651,0.6771,5.5891,1.3603,0.0436,1.1628,2.4446,0.8969,1.1603,1.5973,5.2935,2.0574,0.5179,1.6213,0.3773,4.0196,0.0009,4.1492,0.3218,1.0082,4.8511,3.1489,0.6785,3.2813,0.5998,0.6389,2.2688,1.4026,0.8777,0.1707,0.3344,4.8325,0.1503,2.3291,1.3418,4.1008,3.6036,0.7455,3.8097,0.1828,4.9953,4.0634,1.4197,0.6325,0.0228,2.3779,0.2647,6.7516,1.5553,5.7722,1.1318,1.513,0.0455,0.1118,0.4744,3.9653,1.5796,6.3927,2.1783,0.9501,1.4963,2.4034,7.7201,4.7343,0.5108,1.1392,0.1409,5.9905,7.3035,4.2151,0.1069,3.3368,2.4784,5.0346,1.6137,3.908,1.3257,5.7956,5.9602,0.7902,0.2076,1.2519,3.5897,3.619,0.0113,2.0928,3.4735,0.5539,2.2529,5.1515,0.4933,4.2164,2.774,1.0198,0.2905,6.1684,3.212,1.2274,3.5671,5.8378,2.1204,3.1555,3.6652,2.65,3.4821,5.6448,3.2209,1.7072,0.643,6.5847,0.4692,2.125,1.1061,0.0675,0.0877,2.9211,0.3463,5.1018,5.3398,0.5457,4.731,0.3443,4.0126,0.1613,5.4971,4.5981,0.0208,1.3523,0.3703,2.5732,4.9425,0.234,1.9083,4.0592,3.4972,4.2878,1.4901,0.628,0.4326,0.0002,4.9676,1.0221,5.2394,2.9759,4.3492,2.758,4.5621,3.4908,0.8358,3.0446,1.0337,3.7062,4.0154,0.5436,4.4406,1.3743,2.0372,0.7699,5.714,3.3618,0.0793,4.2075,4.7606,1.9374,1.8817,3.5312,1.6783,0.6747,2.7967,0.0985,4.1433,2.5319,0.617,1.0065,0.1308,3.7869,0.2464,1.0029,3.3322,1.0321,3.9079,0.7784,3.0539,0.7265,5.7947,0.3357,0.7103,5.4993,6.5791,2.5038,5.1496,5.1677,1.0576,2.8032,1.9821,2.4816,4.0278,2.1717,0.7112,3.7624,0.5427,2.6634,0.4976,0.5067,0.0859,2.236,2.2252,0.6978,3.1655,6.6943,3.2027,2.5718,4.0291,0.7087,4.0282,5.0849,0.9508,0.7757,3.0067,1.9506,0.6676,2.7845,1.5219,0.3086,4.2991,0.4863,2.0348,1.8573,1.5551,2.2169,2.672,0.075,0.6685,1.295,0.1449,2.2818,0.4668,0.2461,1.6816,0.4839,1.5816,1.3227,1.6535,0.0758,1.4644,1.9482,0.9961,5.7375,3.8025,1.2148,4.0551,3.3851,0.8985,0.4978,0.409,3.1718,7.4895,1.9061,5.9324,1.2688,0.3371,0.3111,2.9382,0.2416,4.9691,1.0781,4.1487,3.1336,3.5597,5.1703,2.9165,2.4984,3.6581,1.8015,2.7732,2.223,3.3137,0.9202,0.2566,1.4438,0.4564,2.689,1.4402,4.6193,2.4833,1.9318,1.3105,0.7397,1.6741,1.019,3.7158,7.7674,4.9927,2.5918,1.2776,0.0819,2.8744,0.0088,2.95,1.3817,5.764,0.8701,4.06,1.6063,1.7712,0.2279]}

{"id":2680,"ended":true,"length":493,"gen_text":"U @ - @ 111 went to sea on a war patrol for the first time on 5 May 1941. For a period of 64 days, she roamed the North Sea and eventually returned to Northwood in Suffolk for repairs to her main machinery. During this time, she was in the service of the British Admiralty, although she has never actually fought a ship or action.\n\nThis ship's last significant action was on June 10, 1941 during the invasion of Norway. Her loss of the Norwegian convoy made no dent on the German invasion forces. Due to poor communications and lack of sufficient training in the new tactics, the British torpedo bombers of the 6th Royal Navy Bomber Group shot the US battleship with torpedoes on May 11, 1941. She was repaired shortly before the end of 1941 and spent much of 1942 at sea. As a result of the Battle of Jutland in early 1942, she remained in her home port, but remained uninhabited. On May 29, 1942, she was recommissioned and returned to her home port, Northwood. After Pearl Harbor, during the occupation of the Pacific in late 1944, the submarine USS \"Betty Ann\", having been attacked by the German aircraft carrier Kiel, attacked the battleship and damaged some machinery. From January 1945 until the end of 1944, her only action was her refitting which was performed in the U.K. After leaving Northwood, she spent the rest of the war in the North Atlantic with the Atlantic Squadron under Rear Admiral Harry H. Taylor. At the outbreak of war, the ship was in the North Sea but remained in her home port during the early part of the offensive. At the Battle of Midway she was attacked by enemy fighters. The German crew had successfully made a dive bomber attack and sunk the ship with her full bomb load. The destroyer HMS \"Bismarck\" destroyed her by hitting her with the first salvo of her 8x18\" shells. On the way back to Northwood over the North Sea during the Battle of the Jutland Line, she was hit by a German air raid during the night. The ship sank with her full bomb load. Following the end of hostilities in Europe, the ships made numerous incursions around the British Isles and North America. The US Pacific Fleet, under Admiral Chester Nimitz, was present at the Battle of the Coral Sea in the summer of 1945. This proved to be her last action aboard the Allied fleet. On October 1, 1945, she was towed by HM Coast Guard Cutter HMS \"Arapahoe\" to Rosyth where she was scrapped for scrap in 1946.","token_len":532,"entropy":[8.5045,7.2923,8.2079,9.27,13.6854,2.1153,7.4832,2.7889,2.5793,6.1422,2.7362,4.3435,1.8448,1.9894,0.0579,3.0963,4.5728,3.6764,2.384,0.6638,6.0295,3.388,3.9782,0.1085,7.6057,0.3872,1.2502,2.9945,8.8485,0.0594,0.6511,1.9741,1.4519,1.6198,7.1461,3.3765,0.2078,5.6884,4.2846,2.9718,4.9521,3.2094,0.8851,4.7793,0.4496,3.2917,4.4095,0.6028,3.2698,0.8754,1.0132,0.7356,0.7362,1.5116,3.7188,1.6406,3.9961,0.1101,0.4123,2.5742,2.2001,0.0012,1.6743,4.2991,0.8041,5.736,1.1731,4.4205,3.7723,1.4866,3.9455,3.4072,5.5033,0.715,1.5022,0.0155,4.7894,2.6451,3.2612,3.6939,5.1903,0.4175,0.5461,1.8201,5.798,3.2558,0.4909,0.7475,3.7889,0.3685,3.133,0.0153,1.5855,0.5902,3.4076,4.7785,2.8529,2.217,2.0668,3.3906,5.1687,4.9959,4.1352,2.671,0.3725,2.04,3.0937,3.1148,1.2363,6.7995,0.0141,4.4412,5.1282,1.3633,3.5019,0.0029,4.4891,4.7913,3.3821,1.3255,4.9933,1.1956,1.587,1.1897,3.1455,5.7936,2.0056,3.202,1.2032,4.2331,0.566,3.5523,1.3691,2.5082,1.3521,5.5913,3.8678,5.8992,2.5077,0.095,2.6204,2.9194,0.0059,2.1662,3.1809,3.5418,0.4171,0.9758,0.4658,2.7978,1.0478,4.0704,5.2571,2.6901,0.7398,1.3102,0.002,3.5296,0.9309,3.7067,3.0041,0.0374,1.1397,3.0188,3.2825,1.0557,5.0367,1.6878,0.2095,0.6267,1.4041,3.5513,0.022,2.4871,0.0005,0.0001,1.541,3.0145,2.5632,0.0943,0.9099,5.3215,1.0727,4.3,1.3403,0.3355,2.666,2.5633,4.4758,5.9258,0.2826,0.0664,1.0065,2.6629,2.1367,3.3513,0.0862,0.7074,0.363,0.6487,0.4263,3.505,0.0034,0.0002,1.0908,3.3264,0.0307,3.1706,1.214,0.3347,2.431,1.8629,0.0113,0.5805,3.4133,6.2655,0.1337,0.6653,5.878,0.7481,4.2684,0.121,1.5536,3.2125,3.3672,2.145,2.1028,0.2734,2.4485,5.2472,1.9538,4.917,5.8508,0.0156,4.8154,3.8492,4.9761,1.2609,4.5313,0.2373,1.5015,3.1463,2.9159,0.1298,2.3082,1.1433,0.4371,4.358,0.7158,3.6589,0.0032,2.2645,2.9089,4.7504,2.9876,0.5509,6.0177,4.523,0.9824,1.4643,1.8082,0.2971,0.0018,4.8088,0.1959,4.1809,2.5524,1.5509,0.2573,4.2145,4.0854,1.9328,5.2832,1.9126,4.2614,1.3687,1.5265,3.8292,0.0176,0.4957,0.1249,3.683,5.4057,0.6593,0.0105,0.7354,0.5137,1.7988,1.2541,1.2023,0.0017,0.5456,0.0341,0.8693,1.0263,2.6414,0.2339,2.7614,0.4746,4.2873,1.8304,4.3074,3.3817,0.0775,4.9465,2.7713,0.1097,5.6683,0.5047,4.5206,0.186,3.5151,0.0012,1.9856,1.2072,2.1621,2.6397,0.5038,2.6713,0.8543,3.3396,1.9749,3.5022,2.8648,1.3911,2.8969,0.332,0.0687,3.5795,0.275,2.3505,2.2784,0.0127,0.1911,8.3471,0.4081,3.9668,0.1913,3.6686,0.0063,2.229,0.0006,3.269,0.8092,3.3818,0.2026,4.0078,2.5438,2.3309,2.2208,3.9954,4.9982,3.8025,5.5883,4.5377,1.4159,2.5678,1.9219,0.3192,2.8403,5.3617,0.788,1.2415,1.8755,3.0838,3.8242,4.7259,0.1571,0.4083,2.0454,5.2833,2.223,0.7178,3.3023,3.2739,0.0667,0.0008,0.1022,4.2335,1.5544,2.5159,4.1157,0.3006,0.3459,4.1693,3.0178,1.2662,0.0,0.3655,1.3723,3.788,4.8511,4.3682,1.7232,2.7241,0.4676,3.3219,2.3772,3.4937,0.8895,0.1989,1.337,0.0491,8.569,0.7086,0.7561,0.1295,5.6307,0.2697,0.8455,0.0092,0.8557,2.5684,0.0044,0.0039,2.9128,0.4571,1.0612,0.4693,1.7122,0.2061,1.1906,1.8008,3.7813,1.4493,6.3311,0.7228,0.6419,1.0025,1.4341,1.6285,3.0934,2.0668,1.7694,1.6955,0.8479,0.0274,1.0345,4.4832,0.6797,2.4366,0.0024,2.7106,1.6886,0.4438,0.3185,1.0236,5.7327,5.967,5.4461,6.1529,0.0189,5.0594,0.2969,1.7998,0.1074,1.4422,4.1532,0.8786,0.7394,2.7774,2.1004,6.1333,0.1278,3.3988,2.606,0.7293,1.3343,0.307,0.0001,0.1855,2.2676,5.0787,1.383,0.831,1.137,0.0083,0.9474,1.3027,0.0005,1.3802,1.8792,2.6741,0.0244,1.1993,0.6737,3.2154,5.4678,0.2685,0.0148,1.8275,0.3745,0.9541,7.3013,0.9933,5.5241,1.6871,0.2501,2.6639,2.8151,2.4029,0.0561,0.3971,0.1928,0.9361,0.3125,1.2521,2.4927,5.7358,4.3622,0.2571,2.8762,3.5785,1.0464,4.1103,4.425,0.695,0.0008,0.0601,0.4573,5.7968,0.0037,2.2614,0.1347,0.3066,1.2749,4.6394,0.4118,3.6911,1.0511,0.0691]}
{"id":3218,"ended":true,"length":513,"gen_text":"Before Bonds made it to the major leagues in Pittsburgh, Pirate fan attendance was low, with 1984 and 1985 attendance below 10 @, @ 000 per game for the 81 @ -and- 87 @ -years- between 1979 and 1985, and the 1984 Pittsburgh Pirates had a.222 avg. for the season. Bonds was still getting a great deal of media attention, he was playing MVP and Cy Young award winning campaigns.\nWith the help of Bonds and the newly formed and heavily promoted Hall of Fame, the Pirates have been on a tear during the last 25 years. With the exception of the mid-80s, since 1985, the Pirates have averaged nearly 28% more seats than they did in 1981. Attendance for each year since 1990 is shown with dashed red lines.\nBonds may have made it more visible to fans to see more ballplayers in a particular stadium and he certainly helped raise awareness but it is easy to look at the data and see what it tells us. We have seen that, with Bonds being in a new place, attendance went up. The Pirates got more valuable pieces through his trade and he may have helped raise ticket prices but we really don't feel that this should have a huge impact on the revenue of the building or the team (we can argue that attendance could have gone down, even if the Pirates did get better players for the rest of the decade, there is no way the Pirates would have broken even during the period without the new stadium). That is really the key point of this post. The Pirates are making a difference that isn't about any one player. The Pirates have done a lot to grow attendance at PNC Park and they are making it a lot easier to buy, and watch Pirates games. The Pirates deserve credit for their commitment to improving the experience of playing at PNC Park. The Pirates are putting the right people in place to make sure that if the Pirates turn into an international powerhouse that Pirates fans won't go elsewhere.\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates will play a game against the St. Louis Cardinals this season, and with the addition of the new ballpark, will be playing in one of the top 10 ballparks in the league. We look at how they have made the park less of a nightmare for fans. This isn't just about Bonds, this is about a whole generation of players that no longer were able to get their due in Pittsburgh. If you had a good time in Pirates games, the Pirates had a great game.

He continued to be represented in the U.S. in the coming years by the acting company The Orchard, which represents American talent and stars such as Jon Hamm, Jennifer Lopez and Ashton Kutcher.\n\nThe BBC said earlier that the BBC show had been cancelled.\n\nA BBC spokeswoman said Monday evening: \"The BBC was advised before Christmas that the show would not be picked up for transmission in 2009 and then it became clear that the show was not going to have a future. On Boxing Day, Chris Nesbitt informed the BBC he would no longer be able to continue as the lead with the BBC. We will be taking our decision as a matter of policy and not as a reflection of the future programme schedule in the US.\"\n\n\"The Great British Bake Off\" began in the U.S. in 2006 and will be produced by Tia Carrere Productions and Zaftig Films, based on a format that won three consecutive British Bake Off championships, in 2007, 2008 and 2009. The show will continue for its third season set to begin in February.\n\nBBC Worldwide, which is part of BBC Worldwide, has acquired the series through the channel's American distributor, which will air the series on the BBC's subscription-based U.S. channels, PBS and the BBC Network.\n\nIn the cast list released Monday, Nesbitt will play an eccentric cook who works as a bakers' apprentice. The series premiere will be on Nov. 28, and will include 30 episodes. Nesbitt said he has no immediate plans to go back into acting but that he might return in the future.\n\nLopez, a Los Angeles-based actress who was on the British version of \"Big Brother,\" was part of the final three in 2007 and 2008. Nesbitt previously co-starred with Lopez during the British version of the MTV reality show \"The Real World,\" which ran for three years starting in 2005.

Initially moving westward, the tropical storm gradually gained in intensity before making a sharp left turn over the Lesser Antilles to south of the Caribbean islands of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola. In this section, the storm should be located to the south-southeast of the islands as a Category 3 or higher storm with maximum sustained winds of 55 kt or greater. During the next few days, the system should move quickly westward and could reach Puerto Rico as a Category 1-3 hurricane.\n\nA small-scale version of this system with the same upper-level circulation and a potential for strong eyewall impacts is currently located to the east of Puerto Rico. A change of location to the east or south of Puerto Rico could cause the system to intensify while a northwest direction could keep the system out of the Leeward Islands. The change in the track, intensity and path of this low pressure system could have dramatic consequences in the Leeward Islands.\n\nThe track forecast of the System through the Central Atlantic is given in the following table.\n\nEastern Caribbean Current Model track from NOAA on September 30, 2018 Tropical Depression 12 Eastern Atlantic Current Model track from WeatherBELL on September 30, 2018 Tropical Depression 10 Eastern Atlantic Current Model track from NCEP on September 30, 2018 Tropical Depression 9 Eastern Caribbean Current Model track from CMAP on September 30, 2018 Tropical Depression 8 Eastern Caribbean Current Model track from HWRF on September 30, 2018 Tropical Depression 7 Eastern Caribbean Current Model track from AMSLR on September 30, 2018 Tropical Depression 6 Eastern Caribbean Current Model track from NCEP on September 30, 2018 Tropical Depression 5 Eastern Caribbean Current NCEP track from WeatherBELL on September 30, 2018 Tropical Depression 4 Eastern Caribbean Current NCEP track from AMSLR on September 30, 2018 Tropical Depression 3 Eastern Caribbean Current NCEP track from NCEP on September 30, 2018 Tropical Depression 2 Eastern Caribbean Current NCEP track from WeatherBELL on September 30, 2018\n\nThe upper-level circulation over the Atlantic basin over the next few days will follow a generally westward motion with the system developing as a tropical storm and then changing to a tropical depression. The central pressure forecast for Wednesday is 946 hPa. The intensity forecast is currently 4-9 mb with gusts to 11 mb, with the lowest winds occurring 10-15 mb.

The speaker is identified in the intro as ``Mr. Ed'', who introduces himself to audience members as ``my friend from the train'' and proceeds to say, `` My name is `` Mr Ed. `` The following `` My Name is'' is spoken over four bars of silence before Mr. Ed is cut off.\n\nThe song is punctuated by four minutes of silence. This is to allow for the listener to find their own seat. The track ends with two phrases: `` The Genesis of the Universe and the Origin of All Things is'' @ and `... '. A pause of over five minutes is then inserted by the producer before a full instrumental interlude that repeats the same five beats into the song. The final three bars of the beat change to the beat pattern of the opening bars.\n\nThe song, however, has a very different feeling to it than the beginning. It has the feel of a love song. It is the most energetic song of the album. A beat that goes as fast as the melody of the song. The voice is quite strong but there is no attempt to use electronic instruments. The track continues with some very nice guitar which goes so fast it has the feel of a symphony, then a very nice bass drum. The two lead vocals are very similar to those of ``The Genesis''. It makes perfect sense because both songs are sung as love songs. They seem to be almost unifying in terms of genre at least. The guitar playing is an excellent instrumentation with a very rich and layered sound. There is a perfect tempo, so that the track has a feel that moves at the beat. The lyrics are in very short sentences but they flow as a single coherent message is being conveyed. No attempt to use instrumental interludes or any other technique to add to the track. In other words, this is the shortest song in the whole album!\n\nThe song continues during the song breaks using almost the same instrumentations, with a stronger rhythm until the beat shift. Two additional instrumental interludes are inserted afterwards and then a full instrumental track with a very strong beat.\n\nThe full song is: '' The Genesis of the Universe and the Origin of All Things ''. It can be heard as a full version of the tracks:. '' I Was Once a Child `` The Genesis of the Universe and the Origin of All Things '' and.

Hindu pilgrims to Rameswaram need to provide a minimum of Rs 20 lakh as alms on top of the Rs 20 fee for the pilgrimage in exchange for receiving a certificate of completion of the pilgrimage.\n\n\"With this scheme, we have managed to reduce our expenditure on the admission costs for the pilgrims and will now be paying them free of cost,\" Rajesh Kumar, president, Rameswaram Hindu Parishad said. On the other hand, the pilgrims are happy with their new facilities.\n\n\"I am pleased to know our children will now be given free treatment in our medical dispensary,\" says Sri Krishna, a pilgrim who recently reached Rameswaram.\n\nThe new Rameswaram Hindu Parishad-run medical dispensary, named Lakshmipriya, is part of the Rs 100 crore Swachh Bharat Mission launched by Modi in his 2014 election manifesto.\n\nAccording to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, the scheme will not only improve healthcare facilities, it will also create jobs in the local industry.\n\n\"There is already a demand for medical services in various parts of the state which will increase with the success of these schemes. I am determined that we will be able to make the Rameswaram health centre the hub of ayurveda, alternative medicine and healthcare services in the state,\" Harsh Vardhan told The Hindu.\n\nDr Rajendra Rao, head of HNHP, Rameswaram, said the hospital will have a capacity of 700 beds and will house a comprehensive spectrum of hospitals including private and government facilities. One lakh pilgrims will be able to avail treatment in the hospital.\n\n\"I do not want any religious or social agenda to be used for the development of this health center. It will be run with professionalism, and it will be free from political agendas. I am sure this center will become a model center of ayurveda, alternative medicine and healthcare services in the district,\" Rao said.\n\nThe idea did not escape the opposition too. BJP MLA Rameshkumar Naik, who belongs to Swarupanand Party has demanded the closure of the medical hospital for religious reasons. Natarajan has now said that it will be open only to those who have got religious certificates from Hindu religious centres.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App","token_len":540,"entropy":[9.662,6.5306,0.2873,3.7135,8.7126,1.3895,2.7795,8.0761,1.8512,2.4847,2.5864,2.7502,6.8025,0.1058,0.0002,3.1106,3.0458,1.5128,0.1089,10.0785,0.2447,1.3761,2.8965,0.06,0.4979,0.0058,0.1718,0.0005,0.3197,1.7975,4.099,7.2192,0.7806,1.4755,5.7561,2.1022,0.4308,2.6374,0.0855,0.1368,0.3634,1.5922,2.4826,0.0169,0.0968,3.1398,3.3378,2.5322,0.723,1.3813,0.4318,0.3091,0.3405,5.741,1.6568,3.425,0.5995,0.0009,0.0115,0.0008,5.6826,0.3022,5.4828,1.2979,3.6149,0.3077,1.4971,3.2854,1.9549,1.6581,5.7515,0.0446,4.4519,4.9207,0.0127,0.6616,2.0752,2.1261,8.5881,1.6682,1.6411,1.6935,4.9191,4.2898,0.1478,4.1878,1.1642,1.3196,0.9051,0.7432,0.9683,0.3557,0.3551,0.2632,0.8729,0.0033,3.3479,5.2834,2.4265,4.185,0.1681,0.8773,2.2123,3.9216,0.0099,2.9189,4.2414,1.7921,1.6366,1.3816,6.2328,6.7396,1.7401,1.0299,0.8221,2.148,3.6545,1.5927,0.6784,7.1629,2.59,5.4128,0.7534,0.0879,0.5759,4.918,0.8444,1.6052,0.4215,2.9187,1.0116,1.911,0.0322,0.0205,0.0075,2.5653,3.2628,0.0011,1.7883,0.0833,6.8478,0.977,0.7484,0.0386,0.0623,0.8428,5.0933,1.9453,2.4274,1.3128,4.9046,1.5191,3.3268,0.5923,0.9445,0.0002,0.4894,1.9962,1.263,3.791,1.1467,1.8726,5.8639,3.8728,0.6442,1.133,0.8759,2.6736,0.865,4.6865,1.842,2.9883,3.3212,4.8751,1.5339,5.2233,5.2862,2.718,0.9218,0.367,1.509,0.0001,1.6152,4.6905,3.4017,0.277,0.0007,0.0036,0.0015,0.8817,0.9781,0.0002,1.7683,3.144,4.122,0.0137,0.0147,0.0051,1.9295,0.2749,0.0017,5.1775,1.5629,0.9222,0.0943,2.6116,3.5588,5.3832,2.3318,0.9993,2.9142,0.0796,1.0597,1.1965,4.8779,0.0079,0.6631,3.7012,3.6049,0.1407,5.7677,0.6012,0.0623,0.1437,0.0035,0.5321,1.8997,0.2163,4.7441,0.789,1.2626,3.0604,0.4606,0.7622,0.1362,1.2486,0.0002,3.6218,0.0042,5.2439,1.9829,0.2757,3.1793,0.0009,0.0371,0.0005,0.0012,0.0662,0.8141,1.7175,1.0818,3.5909,0.0819,3.0131,3.0289,0.6204,2.3311,2.4107,0.1188,0.1142,3.6586,1.6598,1.6474,0.4192,2.4405,2.9314,0.3243,0.7767,0.0002,0.8632,3.8104,1.2421,4.6885,0.4663,3.4071,0.2909,2.2583,1.6943,0.2961,5.2675,0.6392,0.0157,0.3892,1.278,5.1411,2.2733,2.3092,1.7012,0.5641,4.1019,0.0204,4.8886,0.8181,1.0703,3.8105,0.9086,7.1718,2.0246,1.6965,0.5675,4.1351,0.3053,0.0061,3.3116,1.9874,3.3256,0.0055,0.0069,0.0027,3.612,2.27,1.6395,2.3807,0.3748,6.352,0.001,0.0002,0.969,1.0234,5.2614,0.2664,0.4357,4.8091,1.55,0.5861,0.2999,0.3731,0.1267,3.2269,0.0042,0.0057,0.0003,0.0003,1.6637,2.202,1.0757,0.2662,0.3675,0.0002,5.9049,2.9566,1.9955,5.2057,0.1085,3.987,0.2069,6.6902,2.8846,3.6309,0.8118,2.2409,0.0051,0.006,0.002,0.5063,0.5986,1.1417,4.4957,1.6511,2.8679,1.3024,2.8673,0.5081,3.7385,0.6695,0.9845,0.9155,5.7386,2.3042,4.5142,5.9246,0.0065,2.9953,1.922,4.0745,1.5118,0.2076,3.649,0.2209,7.0902,4.1405,2.1077,1.1991,0.6387,1.9174,0.0041,0.7976,1.9743,1.4432,0.1562,1.1707,1.3875,0.4326,0.0002,1.3732,4.0848,5.7318,0.1807,2.6226,3.4202,3.5605,2.7711,2.9488,4.7863,0.5901,0.8883,2.9584,2.1531,2.0608,3.0027,0.0598,2.3387,2.8626,3.5548,0.4728,1.9627,0.9897,0.7408,2.0847,3.1731,5.314,1.9058,2.8874,2.8496,0.2332,1.1175,3.6931,2.409,2.8085,2.9346,1.7185,2.1554,1.1748,1.8595,2.6081,3.3881,0.0953,2.33,0.5188,0.9568,5.1758,1.7322,1.6639,0.0018,0.0005,0.0821,0.8863,0.3199,0.1184,0.2764,0.8008,0.4134,0.3007,0.1903,4.9708,0.138,0.9036,0.2689,0.0292,0.346,0.0002,1.6247,5.6757,8.8342,0.0803,3.6899,0.3418,2.2096,3.5922,0.1517,3.2968,1.4999,3.4503,0.5417,0.3126,5.9041,0.0169,5.3328,0.0229,2.3008,0.4498,3.0394,0.0012,6.1527,1.7743,0.8303,3.1373,0.6351,4.2955,6.1979,2.8543,1.9719,2.8421,0.017,0.2211,2.2342,4.5694,3.8887,3.1021,0.2911,0.1102,6.6509,4.9873,0.0439,0.0575,3.4607,4.8026,2.5144,0.64,3.5403,1.4981,0.4802,2.9564,1.9987,1.5667,2.2381,0.4723,1.7011,4.4946,6.1801,0.3367,1.3417,4.2047,2.4993,4.7713,0.437,0.5082,0.0002,2.4887,0.0527,0.0003,0.0004,0.0402,0.0,0.001,0.0,0.0001,0.0,0.0]}
{"id":4945,"ended":false,"length":408,"gen_text":"In January 1921, Maulbetsch was hired as the head coach at Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College ( now Oklahoma State ) in Stillwater, Oklahoma. He served as the coach at Oklahoma A&M from 1924 until 1933 and coached UCLA from 1933 until 1935.\n\nMaulbetsch was known for his outstanding offensive scheme and for designing the 'Triangular' offense, which he used at Oklahoma A&M. The 'Triangular' was a run-heavy offense that depended heavily on the vertical passing game. Although the offense was successful at both Oklahoma A&M and UCLA, it never became the new standard or the favorite of most of the top college football programs of the time.\n\nAlthough he never coached on a winning team, Maulbetsch did manage twice to take a team to the postseason: at Michigan State in 1927, and at Louisiana State in 1931. Maulbetsch won 6 conference championships (including two conference championships in both the Southwest and Southwest Conference), and he also coached on 8 NCAA football championship teams.\n\nMaulbetsch was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951, the Southwest Conference College Football Hall of Fame in 1985, and the National College Football Hall of Fame in 2000.\n\nMaulbetsch coached his last game at the Southwest Conference against the San Jose State Spartans, which was played on November 4th, 1984.\n\nIn his final seasons, Oklahoma's record was 6-6 and Maulbetsch guided his teams to bowl games in 1951 (3-1), 1953 (2-0) and 1958 (2-0). In one of his final seasons, he coached his final team to a 7-0 season, and his 'Triangular' offense was on full display in the 1955 Sugar Bowl against LSU.

{"id":1831,"ended":true,"length":493,"gen_text":"Until the Whole World Hears was nominated for the Pop \/ Contemporary Album of the Year at the 42nd GMA Dove Awards Two of its three singles also received award nominations ; its title track \"Breathe\" earned praise from The New York Times ( \"a stirring hymn\" ), as well as the L.A. Times and BBC Music, while the R&B ballad \"This Love\" received an accolade from the British Broadcast Union. [Photo by Larry Busacca\/Getty Images for SiriusXM]\n\n\"This Love\", with its haunting vocal from Pharrell Williams, is the biggest new track from the album. The song finds the singer reaching into his inner self and taking control; he calls on old relationships and old love to offer solace while he's on his road solo. In a clip from the L.A. Times interview with the singer, he said he considers love to be the biggest thing in the world but that it's often misunderstood and feared: \"Just be happy with everyone, and there's a very big world out there that needs you so much that you won't be lonely,\" he said, explaining why he chose the title of the song. \"I wanted something optimistic. I like that you can have a lot of options but you can still find your way back home.\"\n\nRead more: Justin Timberlake & DJ Khaled Will Perform at Kanye West's Saint Pablo Live Show\n\nAs we look towards the release of TDE's latest album, we can't help but think of what we'll be listening to at the end of this week: three beautiful ballads, two gorgeous raps (\"The Love That Remains\" and \"This Love\") and a beautiful, soulful sound by a bunch of talented rappers. When looking at this year's major releases, there were few that captured such soul in the way that these three acts did. We're not the only ones that think that way; Billboard magazine released its ranking of 2016's top releases, and TDE wasn't out of the Top 40 entirely, placing in the 60s. And this is just what we've seen of the group so far; Kendrick, Ab-Soul, and ScHoolboyQ took their time between records, so it isn't out of the question that their new album will be better than last year's: we were just excited to hear it all the way through.\n\nTDE are currently promoting the release of their latest project via their Live Instagram Feeds. Check them out below.\n\nFor more updates from Kendrick, Ab-Soul, ScHoolboy Q, and TDE, stay tuned to Billboard.com.","token_len":542,"entropy":[1.8755,10.918,2.9822,5.9981,1.8433,6.9673,5.4137,0.1338,1.7209,9.5719,8.5798,5.2122,0.723,1.0436,0.0211,0.0295,1.3071,0.1553,6.26,0.0053,9.1805,4.2,11.7346,0.03,11.8392,3.8348,3.0794,4.179,2.2897,5.3817,2.6813,5.5476,0.218,11.3269,4.9208,3.3077,0.1485,2.2758,4.6835,1.9193,0.0311,0.5627,2.8337,6.5621,1.2915,3.555,1.5119,0.0863,0.005,4.5324,1.7402,2.1819,4.495,5.0327,0.0009,2.3451,0.7476,3.503,0.8808,0.0093,1.913,5.0856,0.0628,0.0031,0.0467,0.044,3.0657,4.7902,2.0215,2.7164,1.016,1.6314,5.0687,0.6102,0.001,3.2832,0.012,0.076,5.1979,2.0003,0.1157,2.7741,3.6439,4.653,0.0125,0.1327,1.4151,4.6299,4.0236,1.6451,0.6108,6.6571,4.9748,0.4313,4.8654,0.0069,0.0003,0.0969,0.0125,0.007,1.3733,4.2953,0.0858,0.0744,0.7673,0.0026,2.4088,2.1891,0.077,4.4067,4.2275,0.3419,4.2909,2.8299,3.8447,5.7041,0.0259,0.3695,0.4403,2.072,1.3816,4.5668,5.5505,3.0622,0.9707,0.81,0.458,1.3627,1.8532,1.1431,5.5541,1.4856,1.7187,4.539,3.3185,0.8297,3.4449,2.9478,1.4991,4.9564,2.3654,4.4616,2.0156,4.8629,1.9902,6.8586,4.2367,1.3535,3.5977,3.8316,1.2511,5.8234,3.0406,0.0006,3.8185,1.2897,2.7069,2.5003,1.8493,3.8977,5.7806,0.288,3.7801,1.4497,5.9553,0.7276,0.6476,5.9034,0.0443,0.0013,0.0143,0.0823,2.1798,2.8131,1.6927,1.0735,0.1945,0.9,3.117,2.4699,5.7365,6.1296,1.2496,0.0517,2.166,3.7574,2.3015,0.9252,0.4146,0.1598,4.2186,1.9478,1.3029,0.9777,3.3272,2.8317,2.6477,5.7128,2.5744,0.6572,5.9346,3.0582,3.38,1.9371,6.3035,2.2143,2.0622,4.87,0.6774,2.5597,4.7644,3.0295,0.9429,0.2268,0.0175,2.4644,3.2939,1.3465,5.7737,1.6261,2.9768,0.6735,4.0341,0.0006,1.2979,0.8793,2.8052,0.1837,0.9506,3.4496,3.5491,2.2056,0.2836,1.3927,1.9914,1.5685,1.275,0.2941,0.2615,0.1788,1.5468,1.7278,2.9586,3.8083,6.1435,2.4171,1.0064,4.768,2.7064,3.2166,0.8794,3.2294,1.4453,2.5085,0.1347,5.9434,3.234,1.419,1.0001,2.2339,2.2919,2.263,1.3118,2.1708,1.2049,0.5072,0.2474,0.0003,5.406,1.4643,0.2573,4.6727,0.596,0.0003,3.6501,5.3362,0.2405,0.0003,5.1958,2.0711,1.1046,5.1001,0.0247,0.0814,3.6989,0.0009,3.3404,1.3673,0.4534,0.0002,3.852,4.3703,4.4676,3.2685,0.6051,2.4951,0.0734,6.0141,3.4934,0.08,3.1683,0.835,0.2665,1.8216,1.26,0.9279,0.1633,0.0199,2.2222,1.096,3.1036,2.391,2.6833,0.9393,3.1794,0.0698,4.1559,0.7645,1.3105,0.0625,2.3797,3.3326,2.7814,6.1136,5.5023,3.0594,0.0262,1.1924,2.412,4.7218,4.6989,0.8903,5.652,4.0168,2.2522,3.1659,4.6565,0.0018,0.792,0.2622,0.0596,2.3662,0.0173,0.8224,0.0655,1.0348,3.5515,1.9574,2.7465,0.0681,5.7841,5.5961,2.521,6.0742,0.0023,1.6027,2.9016,0.7799,5.3444,5.364,0.6738,3.0462,1.9274,0.1402,5.7821,1.0674,0.2937,2.8576,3.6956,3.3129,1.1741,3.713,4.9018,6.1619,2.7385,1.7285,1.2762,0.6252,2.8,0.9291,6.3955,0.9371,0.4151,3.0993,1.7218,3.4961,3.7879,0.1893,0.0436,2.486,1.3219,1.6965,1.0857,1.9961,2.7609,3.5698,4.8132,0.9704,4.07,0.1086,3.6359,0.081,2.8703,5.5245,1.3672,0.419,2.0169,0.0125,5.4094,0.0002,7.26,0.2996,0.0752,2.1172,2.6962,5.6019,1.6724,4.2005,1.9482,0.5504,5.5045,0.542,0.8053,4.3264,3.8989,1.188,2.6042,3.6919,1.646,1.6097,2.4293,2.8495,0.8358,1.6971,1.5683,0.0009,1.9213,5.3283,2.5702,1.168,0.0061,0.0004,0.6477,1.0311,3.2954,0.0001,0.0,0.0054,4.6876,6.0724,2.5676,1.9556,4.202,3.9392,1.0632,3.4525,1.7253,6.0693,0.0002,2.3147,0.004,0.0462,0.375,0.1896,3.7018,2.5275,0.809,0.7647,1.1261,4.3696,0.2345,3.2572,0.1375,0.0621,6.0348,2.6903,6.9052,2.4126,3.9263,0.2982,0.6722,1.9247,3.899,1.8118,0.2493,0.0781,0.2625,0.5904,0.0003,3.2114,0.161,4.4295,1.4068,3.5368,1.7747,1.2485,0.0731,0.6568,2.3082,3.1577,5.0477,1.7783,6.1744,5.9909,2.8558,2.1049,1.1485,2.175,1.7316,0.0294,0.2326,0.885,0.6817,0.0002,4.768,0.4793,4.2153,2.9067,1.7122,2.264,1.0409,0.0504,0.0012,0.2666,1.9179,0.0003,0.0,0.0053,0.5132,0.3651,0.3327,1.189,0.0075,0.2876,1.8107,0.057,0.1023,2.5919,0.0953,1.6575,0.3182]}

{"id":2778,"ended":true,"length":468,"gen_text":"After writing One Hundred Years of Solitude Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez returned to Europe, this time bringing along his family, to live in Barcelona, Spain, for seven years. The international recognition Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez was receiving for his new novel and his many accolades made it easier for him to leave behind his homeland and begin a new life.\n\nThe author's children, both named Juan Carlos and living in Mexico with their mother Maria Negra, said of his time after his book was published in 1954:\n\n\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\" became a bestseller in Spain, and became the foundation for his world fame. The book won the Best Novel Award of the World Fantasy Critics Association; a Nobel Prize was awarded for it; and the award was renamed the Miguel Cervantes Prize for Literature. In Mexico, the book was translated more than 80 times in the first five years after its publication.\n\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's work inspired the likes of Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and Mario Vargas Llosa, and has influenced many Mexican writers.\n\nAt the time of his death in 1982, he received the Nobel Prize for Literature, and was named as the winner of the award's International prize.\n\nThe legacy of Juan Rulfo Rulfo was made official through the creation of the Rulfo Awards (the Miguel Cervantes Prize), honoring literary works \"in which we identify ourselves with Rulfo's character.\"\n\nHe died in the same year that author William Faulkner was inducted as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 2005, after receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Mexican National Academy of Culture, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez was inducted into the Mexican National Hall of Fame by President Vincente Fox.

{"id":126,"ended":false,"length":451,"gen_text":"Krasnyi Kavkaz, in company with the cruisers Chervona Ukraina, Komintern and a number of destroyers, laid down a defensive mine barrage protecting the Black Sea Fleet base at Sevastopol on 22 June 1941. At the height of the operation, she anchored on the Bosphorus opposite the Red Army warships and heavy cruiser Kolchuga, although she has never actually fired a torpedo at the latter. With her mines laid she then took part in the Soviet-Baltic blockade of the Kaliningrad Region of the USSR.\n\nIn the second quarter of 1942, her escort was the cruiser Vaygach and four destroyers, the first torpedo strike against the British Fleet in April had been by the Kama Torpedo Boat but had missed its intended target. In July, the German battleship Tirpitz attacked the fleet off Murmansk but the vessel was forced to lay the deck anchor before her battery could be expended against the escort, which included the battleship Bismarck and the cruiser Scharnhorst, and an anti-aircraft battery which had been assigned to block some of the other ships.\n\nFinally in August, while in line with the flotilla on the Black Sea, Krasnyi began to run out of ammunition, although she was not damaged during the attacks of the US submarines E-15 and O-1 which had attacked on 31 July. With her crew leaving the ship, she lay broken-up in the open sea and sank with all hands on 6 September. The ships had spent more than two months at sea and the total losses had risen past three thousand men. The ships were almost all sunk at least once, including the Soviet destroyer Nogay, which sank with her crew on the night of 10 August 1943, after their ship had been hit by a torpedo at the rear. The destroyer Olynya which was torpedoed by a British submarine on the same date took three days to reach port, and the Soviet trawler Skorpion which was attacked two days after the Kada and Olynya when it was nearing the southern end of the Black Sea. The Soviet submarines Orel (1944) and Kolb (1944) also damaged the Kada.\n\nPosthumously awarded the Order of Lenin, the vessel, built by the Russian yard of Nizhny Tagil and launched on 11 June 1936, was first registered and commissioned in October 1937, the same year that it was joined to the Black Sea Fleet.\n\nSee also\n\nFor other sources relating to, and links to, the submarine Kada, see:","token_len":544,"entropy":[7.3266,3.5512,0.9397,4.0736,3.9511,0.007,0.0883,3.0642,4.8162,9.7263,0.138,1.2405,12.4318,0.4745,8.651,5.0349,1.5937,9.7298,0.3413,1.2355,2.8134,6.0398,0.0012,2.4596,6.6851,3.6795,0.0033,2.7362,0.0002,0.7151,5.3276,2.5951,0.963,5.7349,3.3586,5.8992,7.0817,0.2486,4.9899,0.0115,1.9076,3.2153,0.8465,1.019,0.0001,0.0088,3.2363,4.5363,2.3261,1.3062,0.2669,4.1265,0.8622,4.3888,0.0033,0.1969,2.0908,0.5563,5.5454,6.2534,4.654,0.4488,3.5872,0.2613,0.0291,5.0003,0.4737,5.6871,2.5034,4.3714,2.6009,5.4725,2.1673,5.5151,0.4209,2.6561,1.4285,5.8179,1.0415,6.4676,1.5217,4.5784,1.886,0.8943,1.1816,1.0545,1.2798,2.882,0.3402,5.3569,2.4228,5.2674,1.6919,3.0434,4.3821,4.2249,2.3419,0.016,0.331,4.0965,2.7048,5.3385,0.0606,3.195,0.7285,0.7252,5.9206,0.017,0.0002,1.8555,4.0686,0.9369,1.9035,1.2226,1.153,0.0091,2.3204,1.8906,4.3441,3.7155,0.0094,1.5962,0.8772,4.1523,3.9218,1.3609,0.9492,2.114,3.4205,5.5618,0.7185,0.0092,1.5768,5.0562,0.1753,0.0001,1.5062,2.0027,3.7985,4.8014,4.1015,1.8592,0.9097,3.9769,3.2589,2.2302,4.4078,2.9686,1.506,3.1604,0.8407,2.4539,5.3533,6.3328,0.0068,0.008,1.0333,5.832,3.0477,1.5435,2.9276,2.853,0.0429,0.6594,2.1714,2.3037,0.9509,1.5274,4.1576,2.2603,0.0898,1.185,0.0002,0.0,3.6844,0.6728,3.0571,3.656,3.9772,0.0005,0.0005,2.3622,1.9653,4.6943,0.6077,2.9339,0.1219,6.0762,5.1546,5.5886,3.1753,2.6082,4.1904,5.4908,0.8972,1.5309,5.0744,3.3126,0.2848,4.3227,3.034,2.1038,2.8685,0.4356,2.2623,0.1784,2.6451,0.0284,0.0108,0.0001,1.0905,0.9018,1.5047,3.4562,0.0135,0.0001,0.0009,2.2189,2.2899,5.5309,3.2602,0.0491,0.1998,0.0053,0.6493,3.2992,1.436,0.6172,4.5008,0.1919,5.5134,7.2868,0.3866,0.1004,4.178,2.084,1.1316,1.1439,0.0002,5.8176,1.4716,1.7024,0.7159,4.6723,3.2028,5.2581,0.4359,0.3185,5.6064,0.0212,0.0052,4.0448,0.8253,2.1698,0.0078,0.3786,2.1654,0.0228,0.0059,0.0181,7.0024,1.1837,4.4759,1.7418,0.0158,0.911,1.8131,4.0309,0.8329,1.4601,2.2427,3.4639,2.9683,0.3798,3.2175,2.6092,1.4708,5.8528,4.8008,4.9412,0.1363,5.8624,0.3614,5.1109,0.039,3.4239,3.4546,2.1747,2.6452,3.715,4.1614,1.7915,0.7365,4.0398,1.3096,4.2086,5.6232,1.2096,0.4891,1.1031,0.816,3.3177,6.3401,2.2496,0.0833,1.2786,0.2449,4.1464,0.4827,3.1668,3.5402,2.4224,1.1821,0.0443,0.4936,3.9271,0.4194,0.7769,2.2847,5.7386,3.2879,5.0372,2.8829,0.0204,2.1889,0.8298,1.0664,0.1784,1.5138,2.2805,4.2275,2.2234,3.9412,4.6881,7.9073,4.8267,1.6771,1.2434,0.2547,2.401,4.1647,1.3978,5.6415,2.4065,2.4868,3.8177,4.4236,0.518,1.6645,3.6327,0.8004,4.5912,3.0579,4.7273,4.3705,1.8311,1.1455,0.5659,2.2349,1.3587,2.1722,2.2318,0.7431,2.7613,2.3813,0.0264,3.7591,2.4165,4.1171,1.7925,3.2479,6.0762,2.1658,1.2441,0.6666,1.4518,0.2509,0.8316,0.3756,4.8022,2.0659,4.6918,0.9398,2.2608,5.1431,4.2417,3.9086,3.4402,1.8767,4.4831,1.5186,2.268,0.002,1.5554,1.28,2.642,0.4287,1.0093,1.4094,1.005,2.6601,5.939,3.8184,1.2473,0.123,2.4959,1.4442,1.553,1.7465,0.9462,2.3888,5.3178,0.0001,0.0324,5.7067,4.6637,0.349,1.0087,0.9526,2.6415,5.1079,0.2545,2.5237,1.1179,1.4888,5.9821,3.8346,3.4933,0.0008,0.0007,0.0037,6.2346,1.8548,0.5741,5.3985,0.993,5.5814,1.951,0.002,0.2508,1.307,0.0042,1.1797,1.9518,2.9859,4.864,3.193,2.7286,3.8003,2.9945,1.8902,0.5508,0.0117,4.785,4.7248,1.6011,0.4916,0.376,0.0836,1.6446,4.6871,0.8313,1.4211,0.184,2.3376,0.4937,0.0002,5.2672,4.6036,1.291,1.6297,0.093,1.9153,0.0094,0.312,0.6972,1.271,4.4885,4.1293,5.98,2.8619,0.621,4.3241,2.5497,2.1609,3.4356,0.7698,0.1386,0.2667,0.1864,0.0187,2.32,1.9923,1.013,3.7852,2.202,3.63,0.1708,0.5108,5.2334,4.2611,5.4166,2.4527,1.561,3.9591,1.0423,1.6042,2.8034,1.8515,0.5861,1.121,3.0786,0.9875,4.7828,2.0308,0.0786,1.8593,0.0013,0.2082,0.4068,2.1969,0.0002,4.8457,0.2972,1.628,0.0005,4.6397,1.9358,4.7846,3.0602,0.0059,8.1505,0.8969,4.6662,0.0708,0.229,0.6522,5.4859,0.1023,0.741,0.9936,0.2618,1.0232]}
{"id":314,"ended":false,"length":493,"gen_text":"Del Toso started playing wheelchair basketball in 2006. An Australian Paralympic Committee flyer on the wall at her local gym asking `` Are you the next Paralympian? `` prompted Del Toso to respond, `` I want to be the first to walk on the moon! ``\n\n``I'm already pretty good,'' Del Toso says. ``I've actually competed in the Australian Paralympics as a wheelchair basketball player. ``\n\nAt first Del Toso had been reluctant to challenge others. ``I just didn't think it was fair to have to compete against people who have greater strength and endurance. But now that I've taken the road to competition with so much determination, I can understand the logic. I know I'm on a better track to having the life with my disability I want than I ever had going on the track.`\n\nWith more than 80,000 members, the Disabled Sports League of Boston was founded in 1983 by a member, David C. Johnson, and is run by the National Athletic Trainers Association. Today it includes about 700 participants, who have competed in some 20 international competitions, including those in Australia, Brazil, India, Great Britain, and the United States.\n\nDavid C. Johnson, who won two gold medals in wheelchair basketball at the 1988 Seoul Olympics says, `It's a tough world out there, and I feel for the rest of us people who may not know much about our disabled sports peers, who are trying to find their way through.`\n\nAt 50 years old, Eliana Bielicki, president of the disability sports league of Boston, said, `The best athletes in the world today, they have less upper body strength; it's hard to do what they can do. But once people get past their early years and reach their prime playing years at the top level, they all have very long careers in the sport.\n\nBielicki said her league has encouraged young people to compete at the level of the Paralympics over the last two decades.\n\nAt the recent championship games in San Jose, hundreds of young people streamed into the gym at the University of California, San Jose, to try out for the league's next championship, the wheelchair basketball event in June.

{"id":325,"ended":false,"length":489,"gen_text":"One day, Zhou surprises the children with a written exam and leaves the classroom to speak with a visitor. Wang's son, Wang Gui ( < unk > ), tricks their teacher and makes him fall in the pond to commit suicide. Zhou and Wang return to the classroom and ask their son to get rid of Wang Gui.\n\nThe next day Zhou is seen playing soccer with the other children on the playground. After training, he asks his father to explain why he is the strongest.\n\nHe is first introduced fighting in a war against a human that can easily overpower others. He later saves his friend after being seriously injured. On the second day, he is seen making his father run home because he thought he killed his friend.\n\nHe appears again the next day alongside his comrades to meet their father. After being rejected, he shows up in another school to train with her friends.\n\nA short while after, he appears during the school's Christmas and is seen fighting against the army soldiers, and later in a classroom with the other children who have been made into his friends.\n\nHe later appears during the fighting with a group of evil spirit. He eventually defeats them and takes a break to study.\n\nTrivia\n\nHis name is a very common surname in South Korea where it is one of the most common Korean names which is written as \uc1a1\ubc18.\n\nThe \"Han\" characters in his name are an abbreviation of \"Hanja\" which means the Korean writing system for Chinese characters. They represent that the character \u6c34 \u91d1 ( Hanja: Wang-Gu ) can be translated as \"Water\" or \"Sunken\". His kanji name \u6c34 is known as a \"tangyi\" which are character combinations that represent the elements; earth, water, fire, space or wind.\n\nAccording to the official Korean version, he's a young man with blue eyes.\n\nIn the Chinese versions, he was named Xiao Miao instead of Yang.\n\nHe's one of the three characters seen in the final song \"Farewell Sweetheart\" playing their lutes.\n\nDespite being given a special move called \"Wang Chao's Fist\", he isn't shown using it in the original movie, he instead uses his standard attack. The fact that he is one of the 3 students that had special moves can be seen as a sign that he may not have had a special feature in the original movie. Even though he has a special skill with his body language, he doesn't even use it for this attack since he appears to be too busy.\n\nGallery\n\nReferences","token_len":544,"entropy":[4.1368,0.9565,10.0391,16.3155,2.6149,5.8853,1.6755,0.5814,8.5193,3.489,2.3391,6.1125,1.8229,3.3381,1.9932,4.8388,0.882,3.5708,6.9732,0.4775,6.7954,3.5883,4.3575,1.5295,2.7435,4.0817,2.8504,3.3344,13.3802,12.093,2.8151,0.7337,0.7736,9.8878,6.3105,0.4472,1.9124,4.3288,2.2781,4.1108,3.1448,1.0507,3.0366,4.1339,4.8116,0.0182,0.2482,1.9921,3.163,2.0876,3.475,0.4904,0.6462,0.7367,1.2287,4.4089,2.7056,3.2495,0.8796,4.515,2.0943,0.0036,2.514,0.0441,0.001,0.8903,2.5477,0.0113,2.0343,1.8841,0.2042,4.6526,2.8243,2.1557,4.4174,3.823,0.5065,1.4527,2.0119,0.6853,4.291,0.4549,1.522,0.4216,3.4762,5.738,0.8937,0.7846,3.7724,1.7588,1.6904,1.1808,5.4265,2.4221,0.3988,1.7705,4.0097,4.1413,1.606,2.7767,0.0001,3.5073,1.5502,3.0075,4.5316,6.4142,2.7942,1.2375,5.7554,1.6147,1.8425,5.1483,5.4072,4.2851,4.729,3.0616,4.2349,0.7437,1.3981,3.298,4.4078,2.3453,2.9654,5.4985,2.612,5.3833,0.2438,1.0098,5.8962,0.7274,3.9649,0.1385,0.7186,0.6804,1.439,0.925,5.7444,2.6834,2.8464,5.1964,5.3103,3.6296,0.8242,4.6683,1.3584,5.8662,1.3303,1.9883,0.3772,1.3256,0.0002,1.8721,4.2132,1.5682,4.4581,0.4684,0.0957,6.4524,0.5816,6.3841,2.0764,4.7408,2.1108,2.2155,0.6666,2.4083,3.2058,4.7192,1.726,0.822,5.1035,2.3317,2.9138,4.3314,4.1951,1.5132,3.3792,1.1971,6.0234,4.9016,0.434,1.3328,0.0002,4.4048,3.3602,1.0351,2.2088,0.8718,0.5993,2.9154,4.8557,0.9136,3.5098,1.7452,5.2074,6.3385,4.0952,1.1914,4.2588,2.2074,1.4347,5.1948,3.1407,3.2249,3.4704,1.3891,3.822,1.6517,3.8066,1.8221,1.6035,1.0127,0.6944,3.9449,2.1359,1.1056,5.2803,1.711,5.3076,2.6498,0.2455,0.7954,0.0002,1.5539,1.9157,1.0377,2.4537,0.4369,6.0266,3.0736,3.0367,2.3195,0.029,5.2019,4.7031,2.6735,1.0112,4.5085,1.0925,0.5853,1.0864,4.0227,2.5515,5.0916,1.7728,5.5676,0.9013,0.6869,0.0002,5.5965,0.4106,0.0002,1.7541,0.9708,0.9101,1.0,6.4282,1.4765,1.97,0.4355,5.4891,0.6513,5.8001,1.184,0.6606,4.4899,0.0471,0.0635,0.4683,0.4559,3.9231,1.1433,5.8248,1.4749,2.865,1.1578,1.2502,4.367,1.6185,2.799,1.8511,2.9122,2.4528,0.7991,0.0002,3.1858,4.5736,5.6223,0.753,4.5338,0.8133,0.2512,0.288,0.9876,4.227,1.9419,0.0006,0.3372,1.5979,0.8936,1.2878,1.0296,1.0029,1.0424,3.3703,1.7056,2.795,0.0689,3.1903,1.5529,0.3262,0.2989,4.6356,4.084,6.1293,1.7583,1.3836,3.6344,2.3772,0.6073,6.6013,2.7305,1.0161,1.7606,2.461,0.8397,1.258,5.4107,3.5542,1.8715,4.2969,3.4222,0.7205,2.2219,0.5915,0.3485,4.9982,2.5169,0.893,0.0619,4.9777,5.2741,0.0375,2.0622,3.9118,6.5304,0.0011,1.2206,2.1802,0.1008,0.0142,2.7586,6.3266,0.4008,3.0316,1.5544,4.9917,2.7149,5.6648,0.2321,1.6007,4.2342,3.7995,2.0089,1.3883,2.081,1.5541,3.2696,5.4756,1.8149,0.2306,0.7693,0.2551,0.1386,0.4461,5.1693,3.6748,1.387,0.2376,0.6886,0.0002,6.2889,0.0062,1.2001,1.7672,4.3533,3.4114,1.3728,1.5705,3.1415,2.3215,5.8904,1.3224,2.285,2.9641,0.309,1.1043,0.9879,0.0002,1.8759,0.5971,2.4798,4.1993,0.4517,1.178,3.07,2.7787,4.0026,5.0333,0.5101,4.6807,0.2927,5.3192,2.4892,0.2964,0.0002,1.9852,2.1768,2.4373,0.0117,0.1905,3.2715,1.4491,5.0805,0.8565,0.6039,5.1111,5.3869,2.194,4.6081,2.3359,0.0037,5.8613,1.8725,0.6119,4.6691,4.5227,6.2421,0.5653,0.9291,0.5866,0.0002,4.7679,1.2534,5.8957,1.0392,4.7292,3.5069,1.7998,0.7288,4.1083,0.5572,5.9395,1.5466,3.5511,1.2508,1.0448,4.6147,0.0005,2.2115,1.0716,0.1791,0.7222,0.5346,4.1096,4.3701,2.1561,3.8526,2.2865,0.7613,1.205,3.4596,2.7024,1.4695,4.4964,4.3445,0.2,0.4252,1.8373,3.9892,0.0186,0.1462,5.6699,5.7633,2.0852,5.0866,2.4468,0.1742,5.2301,0.1742,1.2085,1.7718,0.7229,2.7984,0.6126,1.1301,2.6367,2.4354,0.3992,1.1189,1.4071,0.6778,8.9185,1.3549,0.3676,1.0801,0.5469,0.4051,6.6834,0.9943,1.069,2.3928,0.8731,0.5506,6.2844,5.0675,0.5576,5.5794,3.7606,0.503,1.1075,1.5202,0.0004,4.6013,1.1565,0.5227,3.7905,4.7501,3.2714,5.4482,0.9787,5.481,0.7362,0.5741,3.3894,2.0057,3.0122,0.4925,0.0002,2.4505,0.3539,0.0002,1.5729]}
{"id":3470,"ended":true,"length":487,"gen_text":"Like other public universities in Brazil, Unicamp is almost entirely funded by the government, in this particular case of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo. Funding is provided mainly from sales taxes, but the university has also benefited from several public funds and grants. The university has been able to build its facilities in such a way that they attract international researchers.\nAn interesting finding in the paper describes how the university's degree program is very unique among Brazilian universities: the faculty members all work at least 3 years during their lifetime. This degree program is what allows faculty members to specialize at the university, while others can focus on private research or have children. The degree program will also allow people who earn degrees to work simultaneously; for instance, a PhD student can also study for a PhD while working as a professor. If you want to pursue postdoctoral training, a graduate degree is what you want.\nWith the current demand for research in Brazil, the university can't continue to invest in quality research and research development without increasing tuition. It can only go so far until the universities' resources are exhausted, so some of the universities have suggested a partial suspension of public funding for these universities' higher education. This will allow for greater flexibility and higher quality of higher education.\nOther universities in Brasil are very similar to Unicamp, where they have even higher tuition and research expenditures, which will impact public universities with higher tuition rates.\nBrazil is already facing a substantial budget gap. If these higher tuition rates are implemented, those who work at the university at the research level will most likely see that the public funding is more important than that of the university, and will therefore need less support from public tax dollars.\nAbout the study\nThis paper, \" Universo Brasileiro de Investiga\u00e7\u00f5es Ecol\u00f3gicas de Ura Pessoa da Unicamp (\"Investigative Engineering College of Urapaul,\" J.E.F. Lopes), is one part of the course on International Social Sciences at the Department of International Sociology and Public Policy (Sociologia) at the University of Bras\u00edlia, Brazil.

{"id":223,"ended":false,"length":523,"gen_text":"In 2009, the serial embarked on two lesbian storylines, one of which involved Nicole. It featured Freya Duric ( Sophie < unk > ) kissing Nicole, which sparked complaints. However, the writer has apologized in the comment section of the interview. The other incident involved Nicole's daughter. In this episode, Nicole is shown to be upset because Nicole's daughter's new girlfriend, Emily, is gay. The writer explained that Nicole is really upset about the fact that Emily is coming out. The episode also features Freya, who is trying to have a sexual relationship with her daughter. She has no problem meeting new people, but being gay was not considered so important that she had to break the sexual taboo; Freya was simply upset that her daughter is gay, with no ill intent.\n\n\nIn 2010, the writers had no problem with a gay character in the serial. Nicole's daughter, Nicole, played by Molly, is attracted to a member of her school's track team and is asked by the teacher to participate, but she refuses. Molly and the teacher get into a fight about it during the basketball game. Nicole confronts her mother, and Molly admits that she is really gay, and that she should have said something to her instead of refusing. Nicole is furious that her daughter was made to accept a lifestyle where she might one day die in a car accident which will kill her, and she starts a fight with her. However, she stops herself when she sees that Molly and her mother are teammates on the track team and that they are in two very unlikely romances that are as equal lovers as she and Nicole are.\n\n\nIn 2011\/2012, Nicole and Molly were in a romantic relationship; however, it ended, and Molly was left wondering whether she should continue to pursue their relationship in the future. The writer at the time mentioned that Molly was in a relationship with someone else. She didn't think that Molly should go any farther than that. At the end of the episode, Molly and Nicole are reunited, having reconciled their differences.\n\n\nAs of 2013, the show was going well, with an average of 2.5 million viewers per episode; and, it was the most watched Canadian reality show. Despite the occasional controversies, including several high profile cases of bullying (particularly bullying against Amanda and her cousin, Jordan) and the controversy over Justin being a victim of bullying (which began when he was at a party with his cousin, where the teen's bullying of Justin was reported to the producer of the show), it has shown a solid and healthy relationship, showing that gay bullying does not have to be about someone's sex.\n\nNicole Byer\n\n\nPenny Young Noh","token_len":547,"entropy":[5.7797,0.2109,1.6312,10.8192,13.0709,0.0482,5.675,11.6218,4.2367,1.2346,2.5332,1.3142,0.1161,3.535,6.962,5.5254,3.825,5.0078,10.7879,0.9175,9.8836,5.986,3.7288,12.5098,11.8871,12.62,2.0348,2.3284,2.1573,8.5154,1.1643,1.9382,2.9354,4.5951,6.0515,3.5208,3.6071,0.0547,1.4337,5.234,4.0535,5.6755,4.176,1.3666,4.2414,0.1602,0.8765,0.6519,4.9143,1.1138,3.1457,2.4795,6.7422,1.5086,1.5846,2.1148,5.0653,3.0419,2.4304,2.9019,1.7345,0.1365,1.0004,2.9477,2.9707,1.1032,0.6137,2.9892,2.8574,2.379,0.2161,0.3856,3.6792,3.6105,1.4025,2.3459,4.8317,0.5724,1.0119,3.3381,0.259,2.2582,1.7211,3.6318,0.5077,1.5385,2.3384,5.107,0.8937,2.1711,1.4517,1.0936,0.0432,1.3316,1.1034,5.4767,0.3715,2.6833,2.0607,2.3667,2.2481,2.2022,3.5311,0.0005,2.8425,0.8674,0.9927,4.4086,0.0389,4.2913,0.5154,4.4087,0.104,0.0084,3.2286,1.0065,0.6189,3.1285,3.5199,3.6203,1.7182,6.2046,5.0676,1.4081,0.9477,0.8685,5.917,2.3015,3.7987,1.7912,4.4876,6.4796,2.9103,1.8689,0.628,2.4188,0.0877,3.847,2.811,5.8378,1.0639,7.1345,3.5976,0.0003,2.3994,3.5161,2.2591,0.8767,1.4189,0.1182,2.2013,1.438,2.4368,6.359,0.4851,3.6245,1.7618,0.4473,3.4906,0.0002,2.0804,1.4077,0.0494,0.9415,4.5112,3.4508,4.2697,1.9026,1.3249,2.5676,2.5517,1.6215,1.9316,0.6479,1.7156,0.7194,2.2907,1.5739,1.3643,1.4463,3.9092,0.8404,5.2981,0.3673,5.4496,1.6436,1.5204,3.7073,0.0145,1.6124,6.0004,0.0028,1.8082,3.0532,0.3067,4.4447,0.1797,3.3841,2.204,4.5906,0.9973,1.8736,2.6695,0.4584,4.1948,4.8839,1.5252,1.2759,1.5922,0.5333,2.9555,3.6796,2.2287,0.5703,3.2133,0.2105,0.6242,0.5757,3.3579,1.0576,6.6653,1.9558,5.2221,0.3327,0.8943,1.8287,5.0011,1.1252,1.2947,1.3689,1.727,2.9761,2.5723,0.4688,0.3887,1.4128,5.2804,2.3485,1.6314,1.0411,1.284,0.652,5.4419,1.264,3.8601,0.6139,2.3696,0.3746,4.2489,0.0685,4.7864,1.1514,1.771,1.8174,4.1529,2.3637,0.4434,0.5035,3.221,5.156,0.3671,5.1173,1.9762,3.3192,7.2215,0.3309,4.9331,5.4618,0.0009,3.397,3.0151,0.5913,0.2787,0.3617,7.5206,4.0695,2.741,0.1726,1.9997,0.7366,1.4594,4.625,2.0137,0.8595,0.2198,0.8625,0.7594,3.4443,0.0177,2.6442,3.5287,1.5628,0.9535,0.7382,1.2599,1.1966,1.0083,3.8585,0.873,1.2156,0.5262,6.3085,1.3475,0.0768,0.763,0.0274,1.98,1.6149,1.648,1.085,3.2558,6.7938,2.9272,5.8203,4.7653,0.0245,3.8278,1.8309,5.4384,5.7684,8.7712,0.1643,3.459,0.4946,1.2325,0.9933,0.2455,1.3257,0.0003,0.6188,0.6377,6.3187,0.1792,0.0752,2.0238,1.7326,1.6596,2.391,3.196,0.6247,2.193,0.2271,4.7068,1.3239,0.0543,2.4537,2.3203,4.1339,1.1032,1.7144,2.0416,3.7309,4.3893,2.5049,0.9532,1.3721,1.9559,1.734,1.8248,4.3462,0.1567,4.0686,0.8511,0.663,0.2234,2.3916,2.1786,5.656,0.6784,0.1711,4.6899,0.3049,2.112,1.7014,3.0405,0.614,0.9675,0.5771,3.2283,0.5057,1.9972,3.3239,4.3131,0.0005,4.0848,0.9276,1.6282,1.5685,3.6609,4.2704,3.1927,2.249,1.1203,1.1751,4.6593,0.2905,0.3817,0.0302,0.2808,1.279,0.1562,1.1316,2.5305,0.3922,1.4202,4.8468,1.3895,4.2858,2.0209,0.0003,0.973,0.5136,0.7769,1.1423,0.0003,5.292,0.2736,1.9187,0.1745,0.8422,2.6267,3.1784,3.7774,2.6601,1.1046,1.4511,3.4674,0.4115,0.957,2.5945,0.3019,1.3752,0.4169,0.1184,0.6854,0.083,4.4531,3.1116,4.4427,2.8398,0.9794,2.4845,1.3673,0.5707,5.0786,4.58,0.7197,1.8972,5.1961,1.1868,5.9803,3.3256,0.5287,4.0894,5.1116,5.7893,0.7707,2.7347,0.6342,1.5679,2.9787,4.2551,3.703,1.9665,5.7373,2.4813,2.9073,5.1121,1.5841,5.282,1.7858,0.6065,2.1759,4.039,1.0927,6.5822,3.7617,2.521,3.4183,0.1019,0.3851,2.1177,2.0816,5.7127,1.5179,0.9953,0.9555,5.1828,1.7605,1.9241,1.6833,1.5073,2.2648,1.1384,4.6277,3.0383,5.8387,3.1482,5.2935,1.8987,0.7885,1.3849,3.4495,0.6941,0.8063,6.3315,1.7517,0.1039,0.1221,0.6964,2.7089,1.7041,5.2235,2.1461,3.9029,3.2053,4.1051,2.0104,5.0448,4.5745,1.0236,3.8447,5.156,2.8072,0.1167,1.0466,0.2319,0.5257,3.4363,5.0728,1.141,5.5267,1.2192,2.1734,0.0002,5.0081,0.0132,6.3384,1.5799,3.1379,0.0003,5.3956,3.2932,6.0088,3.4143,4.3801]}
{"id":4584,"ended":true,"length":488,"gen_text":"The president and general manager of Pacific Northwest Theatres, Inc., Harry C. Arthur, believed Seattle to be a place of growing importance in the motion picture industry in the mid @ 1920s and early @ 1930s. The Cineplex (later Century) chain had begun in 1921 with one theater in Tacoma. Its first moviehouse opened in 1924 to accommodate several repertory shows, and later became an inter-city moviehouse. By 1927, theaters all over the Pacific Northwest had adopted movie style interiors, and the number of inter-city theaters grew from 5 to 12, and the Cineplex chain opened new theaters in other states. (For more details on Seattle's development, see How Seattle Got Its Shape.)\n\n\nSeattle grew to a population of about 300,000 in 1920, and by 1930 nearly 900,000 people lived here. In 1941 the population surpassed 870,000. The city received national attention for its use during the war, and the new downtown theaters were used for Army, Navy, and Marines training and reunions. Other areas of interest included the Space Needle.\n\n\nSeattle's population continued to grow. In 1951 Seattle surpassed 100,000 for the third consecutive year, and by 1974, it topped 2 million. (The most recent figures are 2,016,100 in 2010. )\n\n\nSeattle also benefited from international visitors, many of whom were visiting the area for the Olympics. In fact, the international media covered both the 1980 Olympics and the 1984 Olympic Games. Seattle was a perfect fit because it could provide live television coverage, and because the International Olympic Committee wanted large facilities like the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to host games.\n\n\nSeattle's population went through steep ups and downs during the 19 th and early 20 th centuries, but by 1925 there were few people left. The city was undergoing a process of suburbanization and growth. In the first decade of the 20 th century, many houses were losing value for the new high-rise housing. In the 1920s, the Great Depression prompted many homes to be abandoned, and some people wanted to leave Seattle altogether. Other people decided to leave due to rising rents. A shortage of industrial jobs caused the number of Seattle area residents to decline, and housing values declined. The city's population reached its apex of 2.2 million in 1951 The housing stock has had many changes in the last half century. Many houses that built during the 1930s and 1940s are no longer there. The population dropped to about 1.1 million by 1950 and to 817,600 in 2010.\n\n\nFor people who are interested in Seattle's history and the history of our community, see this page.","token_len":547,"entropy":[6.3345,3.6043,7.4346,0.795,2.1726,8.4621,3.4489,8.1798,0.1989,0.3331,0.6279,5.5463,0.513,6.4589,4.6348,0.7462,9.2475,0.2051,8.2425,8.3676,4.4259,0.0408,0.9651,4.0561,2.6437,5.965,3.5295,1.4078,0.3374,2.9709,0.0222,0.2756,4.403,0.5634,3.3096,16.4542,3.9353,0.4122,2.6837,2.7003,1.246,0.0896,0.0062,0.2533,2.0534,5.9328,1.9393,0.7668,4.1099,2.1642,5.1789,0.6702,4.0169,2.2861,3.1642,2.1591,3.9704,1.529,3.1288,0.7145,0.4913,3.9199,1.4162,4.309,1.3373,3.0737,5.849,1.0155,0.3497,2.9922,4.9216,4.0219,6.1378,5.6003,0.5828,0.0059,2.7042,2.0999,1.7474,4.1424,3.2445,3.0749,5.0733,1.0437,1.1859,1.987,1.4787,1.0559,3.4402,2.5626,0.6963,5.4487,5.5207,0.2178,0.4513,1.4466,0.0142,1.6857,4.8116,5.2038,5.8404,3.4647,0.0948,1.4308,1.2664,1.583,4.785,0.0715,4.041,0.1789,0.0666,0.9004,1.8404,2.2561,4.6747,0.3742,3.1587,2.9385,1.9558,1.6033,2.413,0.0344,0.0009,0.6096,3.1912,3.937,0.7388,0.5723,3.4833,3.1122,0.7824,4.7833,3.8871,1.2027,2.5097,1.073,3.0591,0.4257,3.9304,1.2161,0.1773,6.2824,0.5383,1.1157,0.263,5.9183,0.5013,2.5902,0.0003,2.6536,4.8521,2.5413,2.0509,0.5569,0.0324,1.8987,3.5115,0.0078,0.0059,0.6326,2.6044,0.7346,0.9856,1.7485,0.5633,5.3307,3.8336,0.0482,0.0064,0.4338,0.4014,1.7565,0.2057,2.6331,5.7788,2.2057,1.3811,4.7515,4.8952,3.1905,0.003,0.0115,0.8781,1.7772,1.915,5.7892,2.9574,0.349,1.6053,0.6332,5.2454,7.2799,1.7799,0.6596,2.0683,1.3266,1.8574,5.1908,4.5359,3.8636,1.3473,1.6695,1.6131,5.2693,2.9715,0.0257,0.3133,0.3493,3.85,2.2852,2.1159,5.6017,0.0108,0.1951,5.5466,4.8073,0.6391,1.8971,0.8616,0.815,2.7302,0.0003,0.0,4.5923,1.4941,0.0003,1.5789,1.2239,2.4687,1.5735,0.0325,0.3234,3.0623,1.0253,4.273,3.2923,4.2541,5.6584,0.0071,0.0051,3.2004,0.0089,6.0483,2.2744,0.0576,1.1242,0.2341,1.2464,5.6006,2.244,2.093,4.8661,5.7061,0.2571,0.4716,4.0315,2.1105,4.6454,0.0933,3.7719,1.2625,3.7698,0.3296,5.3665,0.0009,5.3935,1.0953,1.5012,2.8692,4.0833,1.5991,0.0003,1.095,4.1288,4.8589,0.1386,5.0218,4.3202,1.9792,2.1012,0.2642,0.2852,2.4901,3.8192,1.6551,2.7143,0.828,0.7515,3.0453,0.6805,1.6352,4.1732,0.0327,1.4539,4.593,4.4304,3.2925,5.1215,0.3342,5.158,2.3889,0.6119,0.2004,1.3019,3.7902,0.3918,1.4821,2.8828,1.7548,2.5025,5.6982,2.3708,4.6525,1.3582,4.0993,3.3584,5.8878,2.9896,0.4108,2.1568,0.929,2.0314,1.4934,4.0839,0.3468,0.01,2.8216,5.8859,5.6811,4.7801,0.883,1.8272,6.9796,0.0031,0.0001,0.0002,0.1385,0.0325,1.5445,2.2915,4.6102,0.5483,0.9808,0.0003,1.3641,1.1832,2.1418,6.1326,1.2024,6.1421,2.7167,0.0142,0.0055,1.2925,0.4092,5.3808,3.4504,0.7896,1.2778,0.0517,0.1097,0.2572,1.3059,1.0298,2.6124,5.6333,3.719,0.1889,5.0107,1.4156,0.8805,1.928,1.6566,1.9985,1.7911,5.37,0.9166,5.5129,0.2679,4.8836,0.0795,1.9658,2.9196,1.5777,2.0367,1.2966,3.7879,1.4789,0.1457,0.0581,0.254,0.1278,0.0874,0.3755,3.5708,4.616,0.4557,6.5688,2.9303,4.9229,1.9271,4.4735,3.8819,0.2079,0.3917,1.7945,1.4588,2.1724,1.3573,1.6025,0.0519,0.6867,1.4333,4.2433,0.0351,4.988,1.2597,5.8289,0.1136,0.0742,3.4877,1.4652,0.5485,3.8614,2.3565,5.8968,0.189,2.7944,0.9879,3.8061,0.2115,5.5646,0.6588,3.8467,0.275,2.925,4.1424,0.0042,3.3708,1.3154,1.1813,4.3113,4.4228,0.008,5.2043,0.5756,2.9585,2.3214,3.4214,0.0081,2.7726,5.0446,0.4694,0.0914,1.1419,1.9877,0.4688,5.1595,3.1085,2.52,1.2571,2.4258,1.8558,1.3291,0.4958,2.631,1.5408,6.3749,1.4073,1.5267,1.81,2.2356,0.024,0.2288,4.5522,9.1216,5.7164,2.2245,6.1544,4.9642,2.5531,1.5974,2.006,0.339,1.142,2.6825,0.5372,0.7597,3.1887,2.5054,3.8979,6.4447,1.0381,0.1151,3.3229,0.0604,1.0704,0.4525,0.0342,1.44,2.1995,0.0031,2.4831,0.5947,2.0899,3.1126,3.6925,1.2009,1.6206,0.7695,0.1841,2.5791,0.028,1.3127,2.4522,2.3756,1.5478,4.0263,4.5867,0.0073,3.9417,0.7287,1.9774,0.1489,0.9959,0.0003,4.9607,6.5699,1.1458,2.7388,0.5147,0.0539,2.4351,1.1942,0.5247,2.0508,2.6449,1.652,0.0243,4.486,3.42,0.1513,3.7258,4.7645,2.1687,1.3677]}
{"id":2254,"ended":true,"length":509,"gen_text":"Contestants are given a series of lifelines to aid them with difficult questions. They can use as many lifelines as desired per question, but each lifeline can only be used once per game.\n\nIt works in exactly the same way as the challenge method described above, except instead of adding multiple challenges per question, the questions are given to you for free to use anywhere in the program as long as you keep your lifelines.\n\n. Questions are given to you for free and can't be re-used in any other game. They have to be used within that game, however, and the lifeline itself won't have an effect on anything outside of that game. There are a variety of reasons for why this would be implemented, but the most reasonable would be that the lifeline would only need to be used by the same person a number of times during the game, since they probably won't have any use for an account after the competition is over.\n\n, however, since they probably won't have any use for an account after the competition is over. This will allow some players with lots of lifelines to make more progress, while still giving players with few lifelines more freedom.\n\nto make more progress,. If you fail to answer your lifeline at the timing specified (which is always 5 minutes after the questions start being revealed), the game restarts with the start of the next lifeline. This avoids the annoying \"You don't have a Lifeline\" screen every time you lose your lifeline (you must start the game over at the game's start).\n\n(you must start the game over at the game's start). It has very high replayability because the lifeline system can introduce a bunch of unique twists, so players who don't like the system can at least enjoy a challenge each week.\n\nBecause the lifeline system is designed to eliminate the need to rely on another person to save your game, you can use this as a way to develop a strong set of habits that will help you win games with lots of lifelines, without having to sacrifice other aspects of your game.\n\nIf you'd like to read more on this project, check out the forum thread.\n\n(P.S.

{"id":1235,"ended":true,"length":483,"gen_text":"Direct appeal of his conviction was considered and denied by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania on March 6, 1989, subsequently denying rehearing. The Supreme Court of the United States denied his petition for re-hearing in the Court of Appeal on January 1, 1990\n\nThe case is U.S. v. McNeil, S.D. Ohio 1986.\n\n\nMcNeil's family and friends hold an inter-faith vigil on August 13, 1989, before his first appeal is considered and denied by the Court of Appeals on April 10, 1990.\n\n\nThe Supreme Court of North Carolina denied the new appeal on March 20, 1991. On January 4, 1993, the Supreme Court of North Carolina refused to hear McNeil's final appeal to the court with jurisdiction. A petition for a writ of certiorari by McNeil's family, along with a friend of the family and other parties was granted. The Supreme Court of North Carolina denied that petition on September 27, 1993.\n\n\nIn late 1997, McNeil returned to work at the jail.\n\nOn April 14, 1998, the United States Supreme Court ruled in McNeil v. Alford that the denial of a motion for rehearing constituted an unreasonable search and seizure. The court issued a temporary injunction to prevent the detention of McNeil pending further proceedings.\n\n\nMcNeil was freed by the Court on June 4, 1999.\n\n\nOn August 13, 1999, McNeil was charged with violation of probation for possession of heroin and possession of the same at the time of his arrest, following his release as a result of his conviction. McNeil admitted to the possession and sale of narcotics and was sentenced to five years' probation, with the probation period contingent upon him demonstrating a good moral character.\n\n\nOn July 1, 2010, McNeil was re-arrested and charged upon returning to the jail. McNeil refused to enter his plea to the charge. The charges were subsequently dismissed. On July 26, 2010, McNeil was found mentally incompetent to stand trial and entered a guilty plea to the lesser charge, which he still maintains is false. However, McNeil has not returned to the courtroom to testify until now.\n\n\nOn May 25, 2011, McNeil's conviction was vacated and the criminal charges against him were dismissed.\n\nThe charges were dropped by the State of Ohio and he was released from jail on July 22, 2012.\n\n\nOn January 13, 2013, McNeil was returned to the Ohio State Penitentiary in Lucas County, where he is serving his sentence.

The engine has a maximum displacement of 1000 kilograms ( 20,000 lb) with a maximum speed of up to 6.2 knots ( 8.5 km\/h or 4 mph) with a range of 5,000 nautical miles (~10,500 km).\n\nThey carried up to four 20 millimeter ( 0. @ 6 inches) diameter (7.0mm) caliber Mark 53 anti-aircraft cannons which could be mounted on their underside. They also have the capability to carry up to ten 500 millimeter ( 14. @ 12 inches) caliber ( 7.62mm) machine guns on their wings and foreplanes. They were equipped with a vertical stabilizer for maneuvering during strafing runs.\n\nTheir armament consists of the following:\n\nMain gun - (5x) 50 millimeter Anti-Aircraft Howitzers (8.75x) 3 x 20 millimeter Anti-Aircraft Guns (Mk54) two.50 caliber Light Machine Guns as well as two 20 millimeter Anti-Aircraft Guns (Mk-54)\n\nMissile launchers - (5 per Wing) 1 x 20 millimeter Anti-Aircraft Gun, 1 x 37 millimeter Rocket Launcher\n\nAs the Sho-Kaku class is a low combat-oriented ship of this class is is not intended to engage in long range combat. However, they were capable of performing a strafing run at the battlefront in close quarters and at least one of these ships was used successfully to suppress an uprising of Red Army troops in the Gobi Desert at the start of the China Civil War. They were also the initial basis of the Chinese Air Force. This class could be refitted to include a torpedo launcher, possibly to allow them to attack submarines. Their low speed makes them susceptible to enemy fighters for short distance combat. However, if the strike force is larger than their intended strike force then this disadvantage can be compensated for with the use of additional AA defense, such as the Shikinami Class or possibly the B-29 Superfortress.\n\nReferences [ edit ]","token_len":549,"entropy":[8.2888,6.8217,4.6496,1.5243,7.7747,3.8536,1.9088,8.532,5.0085,9.7871,2.3349,6.1138,0.0157,9.0724,7.5725,0.711,2.2932,5.6029,14.0174,4.883,7.7976,5.0886,3.7326,2.1964,0.7697,9.0253,10.339,6.1766,8.3596,9.7134,12.4093,10.5293,3.408,1.9469,5.6191,3.6842,2.1281,9.2769,3.8309,5.9804,6.0572,3.1764,4.4404,4.9897,5.6236,1.355,1.5154,0.4389,1.7503,0.1244,5.1558,5.4275,3.5294,3.8215,1.4267,1.8699,0.258,0.6411,0.0449,0.4364,1.245,0.0629,0.1034,0.02,0.1574,0.0007,0.0061,2.8599,4.6838,1.0446,0.1149,1.7414,0.5677,0.1492,1.7129,0.6753,7.1551,2.2989,0.2396,1.3793,3.7006,4.426,0.1165,4.5661,5.4675,2.6426,0.0796,3.11,0.8799,4.0734,1.07,2.9405,1.0853,2.903,3.1812,6.268,1.4751,0.8802,1.1859,2.8614,2.9972,6.5005,0.9557,0.0001,4.9693,4.8309,0.9758,3.6745,1.2205,3.4937,5.3026,2.8557,3.5611,4.5113,5.4236,3.2819,4.392,2.44,0.8653,0.0146,0.6886,2.3344,2.4281,5.573,0.569,1.4761,5.6182,0.0372,4.7834,3.3635,0.925,3.1909,0.9777,0.336,1.0748,1.442,3.1587,0.3441,1.3784,0.7493,0.0561,4.6025,0.0056,4.0604,1.8088,2.5162,2.2104,0.4292,1.9273,0.3449,1.9758,1.4053,0.3105,0.114,3.3128,0.2893,1.4822,1.6939,2.1691,0.6072,1.6657,0.1083,3.7619,1.3031,0.6541,3.6338,0.1925,0.0298,5.0635,3.6772,0.0383,2.742,0.2557,0.8761,0.7725,0.0002,2.6515,3.9929,3.4861,0.0101,4.1924,3.717,1.5358,0.0083,0.3326,0.2632,0.028,0.1232,4.9614,4.5644,1.2945,3.6909,1.8915,4.4993,0.4259,4.3273,3.5303,0.1284,3.9185,5.8226,4.9492,3.2407,0.0454,0.184,0.0068,1.5871,3.6458,0.9351,1.621,2.0558,0.7182,2.8362,4.4794,1.2842,1.9733,1.4792,3.7729,3.6961,2.096,0.4567,0.9181,1.4689,0.0055,4.347,4.6525,0.6419,0.1383,0.114,6.1974,0.5174,2.5501,3.3704,1.024,0.0926,0.5443,1.0678,4.3407,0.1749,0.6358,0.311,0.1214,0.9939,0.1164,2.586,0.5438,2.6686,2.2552,4.8644,1.2727,0.3223,2.6209,1.9515,2.7487,0.0374,1.4596,4.9911,2.4998,0.1096,2.4858,3.1595,0.3474,3.1835,4.4912,0.0251,0.2282,0.5474,0.4744,0.0002,3.3758,1.992,0.191,3.2299,0.0216,3.2977,0.3313,0.3543,0.2716,0.0002,5.4389,2.7679,1.6523,5.106,4.5329,3.2399,1.4698,4.0976,1.1759,0.0276,6.0321,0.1323,1.5038,0.0009,6.1589,0.5496,0.0023,0.7103,4.7174,2.5897,3.6573,1.2665,0.2622,5.6326,2.2808,1.5549,0.3385,0.0074,1.3636,0.0161,0.5196,0.0009,1.7804,0.1496,6.6131,1.5004,5.0612,0.305,5.8134,6.9593,7.0911,3.3456,6.2623,0.4212,0.2223,7.685,1.2496,0.1118,1.5022,3.1139,0.2705,0.0045,0.798,0.0168,0.2532,0.0009,0.1307,0.4113,0.2755,0.0102,7.3944,1.0202,0.349,1.5565,0.0002,4.8382,0.3115,2.2168,0.338,1.1908,2.7156,8.6442,4.2624,0.2411,3.3345,0.3447,2.3249,0.378,0.0035,0.5822,0.0104,0.2294,0.0004,0.4596,3.0684,1.1357,0.0755,5.3906,0.5011,0.0029,5.0262,0.8897,2.2366,0.0002,5.5313,2.666,7.673,0.1224,4.3099,0.266,0.6872,2.5481,1.5318,4.7,6.4386,2.4771,3.2119,2.7651,5.0545,4.8619,1.2237,4.6972,3.1622,1.8127,4.3302,0.5931,1.5544,0.9097,2.1821,0.8612,1.6415,1.0241,2.7649,0.5303,1.472,2.1845,2.3816,0.0807,2.6522,2.7673,2.7031,0.048,0.0272,2.8558,2.7754,6.1287,2.2219,3.2431,4.078,2.1527,3.0697,4.1437,4.2342,1.299,1.8885,2.2029,0.6301,0.8601,1.9109,6.7436,1.5886,5.3804,2.6213,3.2194,1.348,5.812,0.9254,1.6122,1.2605,1.1572,5.6008,0.8845,0.2222,4.8045,0.3573,2.4902,0.0022,0.3324,4.6181,1.7376,0.0084,0.3567,3.0956,0.7501,0.5789,3.6863,6.1859,3.9822,1.3095,0.3289,3.0129,3.5595,0.358,1.6912,4.7429,1.2903,4.0749,1.3778,5.3646,0.0422,1.2079,4.5723,1.4872,3.2323,1.9589,2.7663,5.6328,2.3912,3.2099,0.9044,0.0367,2.8942,3.0149,0.7228,4.7686,5.1219,0.9227,3.0891,0.3598,3.3574,0.0122,1.5267,1.4009,5.6245,4.2819,4.6281,1.8666,0.5941,3.3303,0.1674,3.621,1.9764,6.1191,2.2078,1.2021,3.5915,0.829,4.7656,4.1651,2.6861,1.1397,2.3437,3.1284,3.4964,1.4406,0.0849,3.1379,0.6968,1.9521,1.5058,0.9956,0.0035,4.5073,4.4683,3.21,4.0442,1.6999,0.009,1.5722,4.411,2.3069,0.7881,0.0057,2.8025,3.4433,4.6216,0.6038,5.1964,2.5813,0.9044,0.9782,0.0012,0.0194,0.4738,0.4649,0.0002,3.1082,3.2694,0.0002,0.0025]}
{"id":3237,"ended":false,"length":504,"gen_text":"Executive producer John Lasseter explained that `` The challenge is that you want to make Rapunzel feel like a smart, clever, educated, healthy, fun human being `` despite the fact that she never learns anything in this film. The story is so absurd that we needed to add something so she was not totally dumb. That's how we created the 'witty' Rapunzel character. When you see her on the screen, you really believe she has some degree of intelligence and can function fairly well.\n\nHe went on to add, ``When we looked at the other Disney films, we realized that these characters are smart, we're not always sure if they're smart. To the extent that we know they're smart, we want to feel that our children will learn from them, which is why we don't shy away from teaching them things that are difficult or challenging. For Rapunzel, we knew she had an intelligence, but she didn't know some things that a lot of kids will learn.''\n\nThe Rapunzel film also has taken on a second life as some of the other female characters in the film have made the rounds in blogs and blogs and on message boards. Rapunzel's film, like Rapunzel, has become a symbol of what can be accomplished when a female creator comes to one of the most staid, male-dominated fields in the entertainment industry and uses her own creativity and intellect to accomplish her goal - the creation of a modern-day Princess.\n\nThe film's directors, Lasseter and John Musker, as well as producer Rob Ashford said they are taking this one for the team and making sure that Rapunzel gets a happy ending - no matter what.\n\n\" Rapunzel was our original inspiration for this film, but we didn't want to take the easy route with this character. Rapunzel isn't a princess with the same rights and responsibilities as a princess. Her story is one of adventure, and Rapunzel is going to be out in the world and getting into trouble with people trying to take that princess away from her. She could be an evil queen, a brave, free-spirited heroine, or a misunderstood sweet little girl with many different facets. Her story will inspire generations. So we wanted to stay true to the original and allow her to triumph. When you see her win, you can be sure that she did something that has never been done before. We thought about all of our kids who would see this film and how we could inspire them and give them an idea of what we would do differently in our lives.\"\n\nDisney's new Frozen movie opens on November 27.\n\n\nImage Credit: Disney","token_len":551,"entropy":[5.6914,4.4874,4.7627,0.8069,0.0112,5.0688,1.4649,13.3135,9.7005,9.1706,1.4173,1.9356,2.5264,1.944,0.4621,2.092,13.7925,0.0024,0.0014,2.5604,1.1338,1.0043,8.0783,1.1976,5.4321,1.3351,6.1897,1.5326,7.398,1.6104,4.7869,3.9277,0.1138,8.4946,6.2199,1.1264,0.4627,0.0856,0.3055,5.0387,3.5327,1.4255,2.3509,1.6577,0.9953,0.3803,2.818,3.9941,1.3913,4.062,4.9128,0.7113,3.9608,4.1382,0.487,4.3076,2.7757,3.8864,2.9849,2.7462,1.989,4.3863,2.3847,0.6468,3.3023,0.8679,3.0648,0.6959,3.3304,2.1473,4.6266,5.394,2.7941,0.852,1.5358,0.0012,0.0019,3.2656,0.5794,4.5565,1.7264,2.1535,1.3506,3.8744,1.1747,0.893,0.3646,0.805,4.1939,2.7526,1.0354,2.6128,2.3295,4.6211,0.0114,0.2876,1.8645,3.3652,5.2889,6.0279,0.102,1.5151,3.4569,0.1505,4.6613,2.1316,0.0244,0.0756,3.42,1.4829,0.2755,4.5476,1.1526,4.7212,0.1686,0.9178,4.4567,1.3938,2.0632,0.5756,0.7743,2.1525,0.5124,4.3309,1.0535,2.1821,3.377,0.915,5.785,2.4113,1.5109,4.9673,2.1235,2.2209,0.2006,0.5896,1.2893,1.5024,5.6229,3.6684,1.0806,0.2978,0.909,4.1028,1.323,0.2894,0.2688,0.185,0.6114,1.9592,0.8698,4.9358,1.2079,5.1906,5.2662,2.3222,3.9416,0.7764,0.3091,2.1614,3.8298,0.3265,0.4592,0.5148,4.3536,0.0007,3.9389,0.0153,0.0104,4.0346,0.6606,1.7278,2.1027,1.423,2.2051,2.2926,2.7411,0.3735,3.9465,1.3226,0.0007,0.0002,0.1629,1.1573,2.8087,1.6582,1.6379,5.2151,2.7883,2.1947,0.9988,2.4197,1.4293,0.0006,1.3545,6.5151,1.3499,1.9138,3.3091,1.4219,0.0025,1.1966,3.725,1.1571,4.1391,0.4743,0.0003,2.106,4.3418,0.0015,0.0023,2.3288,3.0308,2.7729,5.8722,1.3289,0.8471,5.254,0.8813,1.1161,6.9873,2.2276,0.3835,5.2502,6.1982,0.7717,1.1032,0.3121,0.6481,0.7928,3.7289,2.9819,2.3195,1.9273,5.4682,0.499,3.7248,2.6108,5.1292,2.1775,0.0237,0.9367,4.1732,0.0016,0.0016,1.619,5.9436,4.3674,3.3416,3.5229,0.001,0.0015,1.7804,1.1577,2.3555,0.5944,2.9234,0.5041,3.1072,2.8825,0.6246,0.8466,1.1588,1.8347,2.7775,5.9143,4.4126,2.1181,6.9844,0.2032,0.4485,0.9029,2.5292,1.7507,2.7157,1.2189,0.3579,0.093,3.5405,0.8357,1.5373,1.1867,0.2953,1.152,4.7809,0.4782,3.1774,3.1837,1.143,4.5214,0.1053,4.7878,2.2163,1.525,4.9754,3.9585,1.5383,0.0468,0.2775,5.1144,1.7838,0.0176,3.8239,0.4204,0.4756,0.0002,2.3684,1.9245,2.0312,5.5496,1.0825,2.8938,0.0019,0.001,0.2397,2.9713,0.7512,0.0,0.2408,5.5004,0.0565,0.0065,3.1709,5.1467,4.9837,0.2038,4.3125,1.4121,2.1385,4.5995,3.4871,4.7244,4.5215,0.138,1.9243,1.8426,5.2941,1.2519,1.2611,2.244,0.0019,0.0011,3.3722,1.752,2.2098,0.0197,3.9198,3.4045,0.4786,0.7396,0.881,0.6948,0.0002,2.7314,4.5165,0.0028,0.001,2.9263,3.7485,4.2176,3.1445,0.9249,1.4281,0.9318,0.9283,1.1304,1.2395,2.7627,0.0006,1.2494,0.4086,3.6994,1.7534,1.2834,1.4908,2.6702,2.4863,2.0028,1.1232,3.4841,0.0016,0.0026,4.978,0.0009,1.4765,1.7463,4.5257,2.7736,2.5996,4.1041,1.155,0.6573,0.4057,1.3913,0.3531,1.1079,3.9654,1.2814,0.6817,3.2875,0.6616,2.8999,0.9283,2.1724,4.0232,0.0016,0.0027,1.0187,3.8232,0.2006,1.8238,4.86,2.5055,0.1218,0.4547,1.6018,5.1561,0.9907,1.1689,3.7953,2.4542,4.5943,0.0029,1.2656,3.4002,3.7543,0.2156,0.1924,0.0159,0.6323,2.2757,6.6585,1.2031,3.92,2.7893,2.0651,0.9178,1.4676,4.2664,5.218,5.0015,1.0013,0.2371,0.0006,3.159,0.7038,0.5285,1.0725,4.1483,5.7167,4.0293,0.2743,3.1504,5.2869,1.682,3.5082,0.9736,4.5759,0.9192,2.66,6.0127,3.3485,3.5663,4.0638,1.0914,1.5948,0.2192,5.2769,0.0396,0.0137,1.1858,1.492,2.4738,5.7393,1.6139,0.3988,5.3189,2.255,4.9293,1.7724,1.3161,1.1794,5.4901,0.4244,0.7027,3.3041,2.8938,0.6309,0.8865,1.1501,2.3063,3.148,2.7908,5.1298,0.6603,0.0688,0.1056,0.088,1.1415,1.985,4.9564,3.6305,2.6617,1.5816,1.9343,3.7926,2.208,2.9288,2.3831,0.4129,0.7898,0.6997,3.4003,3.0811,1.7736,2.0626,0.1326,2.8068,2.2259,0.0377,3.1366,2.0943,0.2519,0.2382,3.4885,3.6104,1.1348,4.0497,2.108,1.0687,0.6917,3.766,0.3933,0.0002,3.7001,1.767,3.3484,5.3476,1.8036,3.0605,1.314,1.4776,0.0928,1.1116,4.3382,0.0005,4.9314,2.3122,0.1184,0.8959]}
{"id":4253,"ended":true,"length":490,"gen_text":"In 2009, the CPS organised `` A Day for Doreen ``, an event in central London dedicated to Valiente. Sixteen speakers from within the Wiccan and Pagan community came to talk at the 'Day for Doreen' to welcome Valiente to Australia and to celebrate her success as a public figure and pioneer in Australia's burgeoning Pagan community, and to call for action to protect the spiritual and magical beliefs and practices that remain an integral part of Australian society.\n\nThe Wiccan and Pagan community has been celebrating the successes and contributions of Valiente for over 5 years. The Wiccan and Pagan community have been celebrating the successes and contributions of Valiente for over 5 years. While we would like to see Valiente as the president of OzSpirit, we will respect her wishes to remain a private person. As a group, we can only be the group we are, without any outside influence, and are committed to continuing to make the changes needed to help the Wiccan\/Pagan community to grow in Australia and globally.\n\nWe have seen so many of the positive aspects of Wiccan\/Paganism in Australia being ignored and lost to history. As a collective group dedicated to making change, we have decided to focus on our current situation, to protect the spiritual and magical beliefs and practices that remain an integral part of Australian society, whilst at the same time pushing for change in our society and our society's understanding of Wiccan\/Paganism. We are calling the attention of the wider Pagan and Wiccan communities to the persecution, exclusion and violence that continue against us, and to the need for action and recognition that must be made to protect Australia's spiritual and magical beliefs and practices.\n\nThe Wiccans and Pagans in this country should be able to freely practice their religion, yet at the same time be recognised as people of importance to our country, where we are equal citizens. We also seek recognition that those with different religious beliefs will not be discriminated against, and our religious freedom rights should also be extended to those of Indigenous communities.\n\nThe Wiccan and Pagan community have witnessed over twenty years of attempts by the mainstream to erode our rights and freedoms of religious and secular freedoms, whilst at the same time celebrating our achievements and contributions in our society. We see that this persecution is just the tip of the iceberg, and we are going to continue to make our voices heard, in order to advocate for religious freedom and to help preserve the unique religious and spiritual heritage of Australia's non Christian and non-faith community.\n\nTo see a list of the speakers who spoke at A Day for Doreen, see this page.","token_len":552,"entropy":[5.7797,0.2109,1.6312,9.2863,11.0234,13.6966,11.1024,2.275,3.2361,5.6834,5.9877,0.0776,5.9993,2.6589,1.9376,0.7188,2.0786,5.1896,0.3132,4.7615,0.0156,10.3086,4.3298,0.0572,1.0241,7.6939,1.0123,4.8853,2.5496,5.4766,0.5495,7.4483,5.0191,1.6834,2.4625,0.292,2.6479,3.4414,2.5565,2.9014,5.5587,0.5294,6.1948,4.8915,0.7899,0.1788,0.0032,0.0019,0.8755,2.8623,5.6085,1.425,0.0012,0.0004,1.0377,6.0059,1.9115,1.2368,2.6374,0.7548,3.649,1.9533,0.4005,4.773,0.8218,2.4236,5.0518,1.2148,3.4848,1.2857,3.0157,0.9697,0.6827,4.5985,1.3299,0.6276,5.1221,0.4882,4.6804,0.9096,1.9841,1.1616,4.5432,1.2735,3.2751,5.2819,0.7904,0.1913,2.6434,6.0749,3.9028,0.3928,0.0348,0.0063,1.1258,1.6882,0.2873,1.4389,0.0769,2.2798,2.5103,0.1886,0.1947,0.4966,0.0236,0.2286,1.8752,1.7814,5.259,1.7125,3.815,1.9068,2.2322,0.127,0.5706,0.0011,0.0004,1.8284,2.1402,5.5459,0.0159,0.903,2.4699,2.1548,0.1792,0.0782,0.3079,0.0155,0.1633,3.8263,1.4561,2.0,0.2555,0.2184,0.005,0.0004,0.0028,0.0115,0.0019,0.0003,0.0035,0.0035,0.0166,0.0006,0.0014,6.7764,2.9322,3.6429,0.6094,0.042,1.5941,1.593,0.0036,0.0006,3.8606,2.4597,5.1064,0.0877,7.4223,5.897,1.2125,1.3025,3.962,3.2048,0.7069,1.2911,1.7095,1.2778,2.0812,0.4606,0.9832,0.7342,4.0256,1.1653,2.7935,0.7055,0.2812,4.9581,1.6398,3.6925,4.5887,4.484,1.531,0.8174,1.3767,4.8027,2.6483,3.4764,0.5682,2.4771,0.9544,4.8095,2.4163,0.0187,2.2521,0.6406,4.2431,1.6648,4.6525,2.0239,0.4115,4.0765,2.1274,1.3335,0.1289,0.1525,4.1901,0.0167,0.0274,0.3063,2.7512,1.8166,1.7089,0.8391,1.6209,2.7455,0.1537,1.2476,0.0002,2.3924,2.7351,4.575,5.3421,0.4749,3.3096,2.0555,2.8143,2.8914,0.1342,1.2333,0.0142,2.1922,1.0846,0.0193,0.0223,2.5442,1.752,0.3082,3.75,3.0265,1.561,4.0824,2.0622,2.8626,0.8876,3.8063,0.9252,4.1198,1.5316,5.5634,0.0063,3.2261,2.4916,0.7407,0.274,2.1463,1.7717,0.296,4.2405,0.7785,3.7564,3.6734,2.9281,1.5778,2.8394,3.4895,0.9483,2.0965,0.1223,0.0344,0.1699,0.0859,0.0106,0.1974,0.2831,0.0722,0.0026,0.0018,0.004,0.0484,0.0116,0.5919,4.921,2.9988,0.0033,0.0015,0.0031,5.43,0.3552,1.9286,1.6059,1.9283,1.7728,2.3145,2.6807,2.6398,0.4187,3.4572,0.1086,1.1313,0.0037,2.3956,0.3856,0.0279,0.0199,0.1983,0.3288,1.5587,1.9052,3.3405,5.8212,1.6591,0.0387,0.881,3.3656,1.5118,0.9083,0.0303,0.0028,0.0035,0.8559,0.4042,0.9098,5.1868,3.3508,3.7545,0.4935,2.9457,0.9555,3.8455,2.775,3.3502,1.2853,0.69,1.0475,0.8649,1.5563,0.5113,2.2634,3.2576,4.1424,2.7975,4.5695,0.409,2.0596,1.4037,1.1797,6.1595,0.0637,2.4958,0.284,0.0406,1.0487,0.1538,0.032,0.3016,0.7885,0.0002,2.2687,1.3446,3.2717,0.0284,0.4416,0.016,0.0,2.5783,5.1614,0.5455,3.8302,0.8967,1.912,0.0089,3.4122,0.5788,0.554,1.937,1.3499,4.6199,3.4111,0.0507,0.0802,0.0053,0.9554,4.2014,0.8618,3.1872,1.9236,3.4606,2.5761,1.4421,3.4743,1.696,5.7777,1.6702,1.4246,4.4681,1.4451,1.4279,1.2238,4.5306,5.2336,2.1039,1.4351,4.8819,3.8939,2.6681,2.4324,0.3137,5.3065,1.8918,0.2487,1.7435,0.0538,1.0627,0.9452,4.8403,2.8054,1.9176,5.8001,1.4766,3.6388,0.4041,3.9372,0.0887,1.4887,2.0865,6.5467,4.1581,0.718,0.7751,0.0002,2.1898,0.9198,0.4153,0.0474,0.3019,0.0225,0.6654,2.7228,5.4254,4.2366,5.8028,0.1427,0.0289,4.3724,1.2473,0.7107,2.3233,2.7529,4.6965,0.0217,0.9237,1.182,1.0758,1.0556,3.845,2.5401,3.1027,6.2369,3.4446,1.4534,3.0986,1.0896,0.003,0.0016,0.0048,4.3512,2.0194,2.5609,0.8646,2.1165,2.6892,2.1246,1.1571,0.2558,1.3586,3.3856,2.3581,2.4717,3.4571,1.7742,5.1574,1.0666,0.2555,0.0024,0.0598,0.0401,0.8529,0.5794,1.8249,1.8085,5.3649,0.0191,1.0818,0.2544,3.0418,1.7601,0.192,0.0363,1.4397,2.9581,1.0447,0.0729,6.0073,0.1101,5.2015,0.3868,1.0732,2.428,3.4628,4.198,1.1388,3.9747,2.958,0.8196,0.6236,2.9428,0.373,0.7838,1.7029,5.9654,6.0125,1.2839,0.1235,1.0593,2.8533,2.2153,0.0895,0.3522,0.0002,3.8747,3.8713,2.1192,1.1751,0.0067,1.8542,0.8075,2.4247,1.001,0.1471,2.668,0.019,0.141,0.0075,0.0009,0.0006,1.0749,3.1916,3.109,1.1987,0.8477]}

{"id":1047,"ended":true,"length":506,"gen_text":"Survivals from late Medieval church fittings and objects in Scotland are exceptionally rare even compared to those from comparable areas like England or Norway, probably because of the thoroughness of their destruction in the English Civil War in the 1640s.\n\n\nIt is interesting to note how these objects were incorporated with the other fittings in the shrine and the way that they have been conserved. Many of the fittings are on the sides of the shrine and some are interlocked with other elements and thus have to be conserved separately, so that what might have once housed a small shrine can now house several shrines or churches inter-connected together. The preservation of the shrine is therefore dependent on the carefully curated and planned placement of the various objects.\n\n\nIt is clear with this example the use of a number of stone or brick features on the stone to act as braces to the timber has allowed them to be assembled with minimal use of tools. The shrine is also impressive in terms of its decoration and decoration can be seen on both sides of the shrine using natural materials, which show a mixture of coloured pigments.\n\n\nAs with other examples found in the chapel wall these features include fluted columns on the top of the main altar, a round panel of large slabs representing the five diptychs of the Psalms, a round panel of small slabs, which probably represent angels, with the names of Mary, Joseph and St. Francis above them, a rectangular panel of slabs with a cross on top and a round panel of slabs in the place of a cross with a statue of the Madonna on it. Above this large mosaic are two figures, probably angels, which are decorated with colours that are consistent with the Virgin and Child. The floor is covered with a mixture of dark oak and dark red oak boards, which show little decoration, although the figures of Mary and Joseph are ornamented with a variety of colours, probably using a mixture of red and different shades of yellow.\n\n\nThe shrine was found in what was probably the south-east corner of the chapel with the altar, the monstrance, the table, the candlestick and the bier, which was likely placed on one of the corners of the shrine where it is very unlikely it was seen or heard. The altar is about 5 metres by 1 metre and the shrine is 7.5 metres by 2.0 metres. The interior of the shrine is in poor condition, the stone is chipped but there is some evidence of use from over 1000AD. The shrine was discovered by a team, working as part of the National Trust, during work to make a new chapel on the site.\n\n\nThe shrine is on display in the NCSU Museum, Aberdeen.","token_len":556,"entropy":[4.9735,5.2005,9.9161,6.8624,8.0606,12.0392,0.001,2.5522,4.4583,3.4125,5.6603,3.5051,5.6982,1.0056,7.4915,5.5429,0.302,1.7027,0.9481,8.4374,2.9922,5.0484,0.9534,2.3525,6.6076,2.0149,6.5206,0.5356,1.2007,0.3538,8.8915,1.5159,0.7609,2.4294,2.8005,2.4398,0.403,4.9659,1.4204,0.1435,3.1245,0.2411,1.1714,0.1811,0.0743,0.6014,4.2273,0.0004,3.9977,0.6075,3.9265,0.3058,0.3519,4.0925,4.0758,1.7072,1.339,5.2731,4.516,1.1612,4.0586,3.7893,0.0001,1.8137,0.6233,5.9613,2.1773,2.73,3.6644,2.1099,1.125,2.9407,0.5842,5.1248,0.0038,1.5832,3.9042,0.5981,0.5233,0.8131,0.0003,1.7026,5.2007,1.453,5.2049,0.3645,0.0905,0.6419,1.3993,3.0018,0.6895,5.5804,1.3948,0.7706,1.464,4.4367,3.944,4.9471,2.649,1.9921,0.0305,4.5694,0.0008,1.471,2.9642,3.6052,0.9075,5.8127,3.7916,1.1717,2.6341,5.8843,0.9056,3.493,2.2149,2.5114,0.5024,1.8205,3.8882,4.6966,0.0001,3.5888,2.5973,6.7545,3.489,0.5067,4.1827,0.3534,2.356,5.3817,0.5335,1.0573,1.9384,1.5542,3.3354,3.8175,0.2649,0.6834,5.9748,5.3694,2.9897,4.0881,4.0701,0.0779,0.7777,2.9785,2.4386,1.2542,0.8382,0.0002,3.774,0.4079,3.4533,8.1626,1.6996,3.0322,5.0513,4.262,0.0568,2.1652,4.7603,0.0061,5.2672,3.887,4.1445,4.7408,3.5686,0.2532,4.264,3.9588,5.4222,0.0518,5.0566,1.6838,1.9512,3.2714,5.297,3.1532,3.4077,0.0213,0.5049,5.5498,2.8782,3.6551,5.0495,0.0034,1.5823,0.7394,1.3806,4.5069,1.2703,2.8573,5.6369,0.9059,2.5944,0.0029,0.7235,4.0552,1.4231,3.0975,4.3109,0.6362,0.8502,1.6296,3.203,1.4247,0.3512,0.043,0.5211,6.9824,4.2517,1.2904,2.3115,3.4619,5.3185,1.929,4.5525,0.0122,5.034,3.9578,0.0042,2.2301,1.3113,0.0003,4.5916,1.9415,2.3455,1.3993,4.3629,0.3953,1.3609,4.5741,6.3876,4.4638,3.4339,5.5121,6.2461,0.6255,2.7006,3.44,0.6898,3.4629,0.732,0.1064,4.3176,2.6277,0.8811,1.8804,4.9496,4.8035,2.077,5.4241,3.7814,0.266,5.9348,0.7414,4.7901,4.912,2.1105,0.008,0.0446,0.6695,0.6916,4.1745,0.5678,1.1423,1.2139,3.352,0.3975,0.4478,3.2772,0.4358,0.0006,2.4548,3.5939,4.2535,0.6459,4.3522,0.572,3.9028,2.3486,3.3681,0.2134,4.0781,0.8322,0.7062,0.815,2.1463,1.3645,4.7345,4.5035,0.7627,0.6044,1.5524,4.0705,0.562,0.7738,1.9387,0.0029,2.143,1.8887,2.8166,2.1364,1.0656,1.3749,0.9766,2.4144,0.139,0.5013,1.0859,0.0006,4.025,0.5593,6.3118,0.0814,2.2413,1.9846,2.8673,1.1748,5.6324,0.2433,1.6151,2.6226,2.0671,1.7817,0.7124,4.9401,1.3229,5.116,6.6974,2.8591,1.8593,4.5976,1.9301,2.2048,1.766,0.5838,2.601,1.1958,3.9561,0.2528,5.4283,3.112,1.3511,4.7014,0.1523,0.6959,5.0317,2.4198,0.2277,1.6978,1.8416,5.0912,1.2716,1.139,0.3956,1.135,3.2183,0.0032,4.2903,6.0118,0.9617,3.2843,1.7042,2.3219,3.883,1.4543,1.3917,3.3721,5.312,5.0008,1.673,2.4287,1.6144,5.5609,1.8112,0.9236,0.3422,0.6666,0.8032,5.6765,0.0044,0.2951,2.4945,2.0096,0.0011,2.3466,2.0768,3.0303,4.5883,2.0467,1.2654,0.0061,2.3064,0.5346,6.36,1.0563,0.0083,2.9135,0.6543,0.8056,0.0002,1.0121,2.3338,2.4191,3.2559,0.7958,5.2646,1.2652,2.467,1.3114,4.7345,1.7757,0.9363,0.2142,0.0347,0.1324,0.5837,4.2843,0.5601,4.0546,2.9855,1.9929,5.6931,0.7258,0.0139,0.9833,0.3409,4.0327,1.4902,0.3682,3.1609,0.0829,0.159,0.5613,0.3218,5.7503,0.8658,2.2156,1.4216,2.113,3.7242,2.7792,1.3133,4.657,0.582,0.0662,4.0727,0.8112,0.0626,0.9499,5.3454,0.6253,2.2092,4.835,2.4511,2.1447,1.9817,5.4093,3.4687,5.3803,1.2786,1.2683,3.6857,1.1792,5.1076,3.2712,1.8011,2.628,3.0713,2.6437,0.8888,1.6777,3.8065,0.6377,5.6442,1.7712,0.4128,0.1137,0.3198,1.1679,0.5142,5.862,0.0977,0.4319,1.1441,4.9452,0.8415,0.0216,0.0781,0.5977,4.0534,4.0629,0.0528,1.36,3.1084,3.496,1.9548,3.6744,0.0882,3.9276,2.3333,0.6413,2.7457,2.3013,0.5067,2.7217,4.4802,5.1801,3.9996,5.0652,0.7633,1.1027,2.1376,2.0079,3.1408,1.8939,1.8398,2.7262,5.4272,4.3922,3.0931,0.1871,0.0019,0.4186,3.6598,0.5126,1.9595,3.2104,3.4524,0.6326,3.8679,1.6941,1.1197,1.5924,2.567,0.2315,0.7024,1.0265,1.3379,0.0002,1.1872,1.5338,1.0866,3.2662,0.9602,0.6738,0.228,5.7972,3.3385,2.0654,1.8498,2.0557,3.4658,0.6833]}
{"id":4325,"ended":true,"length":533,"gen_text":"Sutler tokens are similar to store cards. Rather than listing the name of a private business, however, these tokens bore the name of a particular army unit ( usually a regiment ) and usually had one or more digits printed to indicate the unit (for example, Bn-101). In this form, the unit was never identified by the names of the companies or individuals it represented. When the War Department issued tokens, it would make lists of the different units produced so that its tokens could be identified.\n\nThese private tokens often bear abbreviations or abbreviated names of particular units, such as the M24 or the 75th (a division of the 7th Cavalry Regiment). These units have a distinctive design on the obverse side of the coin with a soldier's rank, regiment, and flag or motto. For example, a large \"M\" marked with the emblem of the 75th Infantry Regiment was used on several token collections but none had the uniform badge of the unit.\n\nIn addition, several collectors argue that the coin itself has been deliberately designed to have a variety of obverse impressions. A common example found is the reverse with a number of small and sharp impressions. As the collectors point out, this combination of impressions can be deceptive, although it is very unlikely that a token was struck repeatedly to give the impression of many different tokens which may or may not have been struck.\n\nPrivate tokens sometimes had their own private stamps. These stamp tokens are usually small and plain and bear initials or the names of individual soldier in parentheses. They often have the same imprint, meaning that the stamp maker had to apply it to many different tokens to complete the design. It is very likely that these design stamps, and\/or the soldiers' initials, were produced by their respective units for their private token collections at the time.\n\nPrivate tokens often have a similar design to that of a private token (as shown in the example above). At different times, the Mint used different designs (for example, the two pieces below were produced in the 1909-13 decade when the mint was known as Philadelphia) for both the private and collector token series. During this period, the Mint issued a token for every token in the series at the same time. In any event, these tokens were also frequently issued as part of the same series. The tokens generally were very similar and had only several differences. The design for a private token was probably a standard format that had undergone little change. They had a different edge from the collector token series. As a result, they may, in some cases, have been struck in two pieces to make a complete set. Finally, these tokens were also sometimes found on large paper currency and so were more expensive to produce.","token_len":556,"entropy":[8.3729,3.8933,13.0984,1.8623,5.9064,0.2475,8.2731,3.3192,2.2368,6.0131,0.0144,7.1197,1.575,2.878,0.4562,1.7518,8.9767,5.2556,1.0448,4.9176,0.0077,3.0683,0.6514,11.892,0.6136,0.9407,0.094,1.5174,3.6057,9.6475,1.674,3.7593,11.5966,1.5759,1.8999,2.4169,1.6621,5.3404,1.764,4.217,0.6492,0.2016,4.9946,3.6937,4.4252,1.5036,0.6329,1.2255,4.3054,1.8424,0.0727,0.4019,5.4743,3.756,4.3734,5.3192,1.9338,3.3095,2.8365,4.4467,0.6145,1.1119,2.3836,1.4033,4.8599,3.8183,1.5045,2.2831,4.3005,0.0882,1.4723,3.2119,2.2658,3.2695,3.7381,2.4384,0.5824,4.7645,1.2066,4.6409,0.9817,1.2922,1.4573,1.1007,1.2701,3.4314,4.5156,5.8046,0.1927,1.2834,4.4661,0.9537,6.4059,5.3828,0.2176,4.6817,4.8989,0.6074,0.204,2.7213,0.8156,1.9247,0.0429,3.9698,5.332,1.4595,4.1699,2.377,5.5384,0.2936,2.173,2.5856,1.2407,0.575,1.4969,4.5621,1.6901,1.605,1.3404,0.0063,2.0662,4.9976,4.4504,3.1059,1.5984,5.4466,0.3044,3.3062,4.5588,2.9245,0.3976,0.1169,3.7849,0.1662,2.1194,0.0004,1.0018,0.9619,2.4363,1.9466,4.1,2.9431,3.4115,3.3672,2.0172,0.9338,3.0086,0.0012,1.4458,0.652,0.468,3.0362,4.1857,1.3928,4.1496,1.9227,5.0612,1.7967,1.9804,0.4681,0.926,6.1238,3.894,3.1715,1.288,4.1451,0.1933,0.0534,3.1209,5.9623,2.4579,0.7997,0.1349,5.6842,1.5277,1.3905,4.8413,0.0836,0.1588,1.8646,0.0039,1.2402,0.5984,2.085,0.9351,1.2338,4.819,2.8118,5.9622,5.7225,5.4078,3.6024,1.271,5.734,2.9029,0.6997,0.2444,2.06,0.6472,1.2727,0.0002,2.9576,1.3686,1.436,3.8674,3.0399,6.4723,0.0797,0.9684,4.8541,3.0717,2.7234,2.7475,4.6414,2.7528,0.4035,3.4861,0.9426,5.1009,0.0132,3.5381,0.1765,6.4562,1.1504,3.9104,2.7642,2.8465,7.2084,1.8041,1.1021,1.9084,3.26,1.2391,4.1116,0.2654,2.6912,4.8448,4.9509,2.3826,1.9764,4.6504,2.2784,4.802,0.8622,0.003,0.023,1.4581,5.5151,0.5659,1.2876,3.2989,0.6654,4.8894,2.1293,5.1845,1.6211,0.8491,4.5301,2.5664,0.2223,2.2384,3.8079,2.0164,2.7939,6.4469,2.0409,3.8207,1.0939,0.2511,0.2601,2.2089,1.1277,5.176,6.5241,3.5832,2.2742,0.0041,0.003,0.6091,0.5045,0.8708,1.2032,0.8593,0.0002,4.4624,0.9317,5.5976,3.7911,3.7044,0.9422,3.5539,4.0647,1.3263,1.4523,5.0165,5.6803,2.197,2.4124,2.8936,1.4726,3.6978,1.5951,1.6224,5.9521,1.0869,2.4266,1.7255,0.0309,2.9672,5.0045,5.0958,4.2812,0.6682,2.7287,2.3394,1.4763,1.6888,1.9754,3.0441,4.0621,5.9882,0.6068,1.2572,2.32,4.4989,3.1771,1.6105,4.6685,2.9984,0.7956,2.6557,1.096,0.9151,1.9631,4.398,0.5711,2.4982,0.1388,4.4676,0.2978,3.4696,1.5066,0.0965,1.4617,6.7579,1.3248,4.5267,3.6727,4.6499,0.0052,0.9262,5.2093,0.6475,0.7338,0.6324,0.4176,5.0477,0.9878,6.5966,2.8378,2.9877,3.738,1.2123,1.8579,2.8643,1.3399,7.1505,0.5873,0.3947,1.1907,0.5961,0.0002,1.8894,0.7243,2.3047,1.7212,1.6293,5.2484,1.1522,0.5941,2.3808,0.2848,2.7606,2.2738,1.906,3.72,4.0727,2.1498,0.9444,0.3054,2.5448,1.4587,0.7648,6.0646,5.9384,0.1961,0.421,1.832,4.6592,2.1277,1.3576,1.0008,4.7352,1.897,0.0834,0.0619,1.1012,5.3748,5.4965,1.9932,2.1036,1.9764,1.0102,1.7601,6.3098,0.4849,4.2347,4.8391,4.7923,0.4177,2.7299,1.461,3.2238,0.0579,3.739,2.0509,2.4476,3.7208,1.8023,0.4075,0.8143,5.3491,1.4493,2.065,0.1014,5.7529,1.2635,1.1192,0.1526,0.9125,1.0701,3.8917,1.9622,4.3402,1.3513,1.6784,5.8291,2.2264,0.4647,1.197,4.5353,0.8154,0.1333,0.36,0.526,3.0904,5.6984,1.8683,0.0069,2.2662,0.842,1.4954,4.4756,4.1867,2.5796,2.3271,3.1883,0.0028,1.4814,2.5585,0.8517,1.1317,2.8861,3.8921,5.8806,2.9208,4.4345,1.1065,2.5252,3.0588,4.3247,7.4505,1.8236,1.1836,2.2227,4.2503,4.0176,2.6934,0.9686,0.0742,1.3056,5.0983,3.3449,4.9828,5.8541,2.2837,2.6482,5.6173,2.4099,0.3402,2.2192,5.7842,3.5337,1.6069,3.8031,4.1898,2.4962,0.7325,0.5471,0.6311,2.2953,1.4471,4.6654,1.7709,0.6201,0.1646,1.7632,3.1066,7.5491,1.5309,0.9386,0.4985,0.0238,0.5678,1.1071,1.9359,1.7527,2.9162,3.019,2.0991,2.3819,1.6594,2.6706,3.0392,0.5836,5.128,0.0066,3.0475,0.329,1.2248,3.4697,1.6519,4.8059,3.7902,5.0079,4.1741,2.6151,3.4266,5.7229,1.076,3.7363,2.7453,1.3832,0.3959,0.66]}
{"id":4850,"ended":true,"length":517,"gen_text":"Supervision of the construction was lax, which enabled the contractors to skimp on the lining of the tunnels. This manifested itself in March 1855 when part of the brickwork of Mountfield Tunnel collapsed, killing three labourers in the tunnel's pit. But the tunnels continued to be popular because of the convenience of the underground journey.\n\nThe construction of the tunnel to the West India Flats saw the introduction of new features such as stone-lined tunnels and the provision of water for passengers and workers. This also led to the abandonment of the plan to have passengers walk through the tunnel and into the flats. But the West India Flats were opened to the public in 1862 with the construction of the Great West India Flats Railway between Bombay and Poona.\n\nThe tunnel to the south of the Great West India Flats Railway station was a direct result of the discovery of the East Indiaman, which had remained lost for several years. The ship had apparently docked near the new tunnel and the passengers had to travel there by water using a pneumatic pump. This project made some of the key contractors of the time very wealthy, as they received a number of shares of the tunnel's construction as profits. Interestingly, this tunnel too was abandoned in 1871 when it was decided to build a tunnel connecting the North and East suburbs. When the tunnel was finally built (under great pressure from the Government) it went unnoticed for several decades.\n\nIn the 1890s and early 1900s the tunnel was visited by the British Museum (the first time), the Indian Museum as well as the New Delhi Municipal Council. The first railway to the suburbs was proposed and built in 1858, using a tube train design, but it only ran the length of the tunnel on the South side. It was also proposed that an underground tunnel connecting Pune with the South Mumbai Railway would be used for freight transport. The proposed tube tunnel was intended to run for a distance of just over one kilometre through the tunnel beneath Mountfield tunnel. The tunnel was actually used for passenger and goods traffic when it was finally opened to public in 1915 for the first time.\n\nToday's tunnel, which was dug in 2001 at a cost of Rs 2 crore, is in very good condition. This underground railway was funded by the Indian Railways, with the Indian Ministry of Railways being a major contributor.

{"id":2114,"ended":true,"length":513,"gen_text":"Gilbert, Schafer and Grossman's primary goal was to create a simpler and more accessible gameplay model than those presented in previous Lucasfilm titles. Gilbert had conceived the main designs and puzzles before hiring Schafer to create the voice-acting for the game. During the development process, Schafer developed and improved his own ideas, including a character that was actually named Bob in the script, a character description and a new ending.\n\nAlthough the game was released without a release date and without release of any screenshots, screenshots were released on the site Gamespot where screenshots displayed at that time were actually showing pre-production artwork for the game. The screenshots show new enemies, many of which were originally planned for The Adventures of Bayou Billy for the Famicom.\n\nThe game's director Steve Gilbert stated that one of the primary challenges with the development of Pirates! was maintaining a reasonable quality in the game without compromising any of the original ideas, which included new elements such as a new and diverse plot and new graphics. It was never an option however to reduce the size of the sprites, so some of the smaller elements of the game needed to be greatly expanded in size.\n\nWhile the development for this game was delayed due to the fact that the team was making a game that was very different from the already successful Pirates of the Caribbean titles, the game was finished by the end of 1994, only a few months after the GameCube had been released. The production was then sent to an external studio to release the game. The game had over a year of development time. The game was later re-released on GameCube Game Boy Advance in 2007 for a reduced price of $9.99.\n\nTrivia [ edit ]\n\nIn the English versions of Pirates! you are never able to tell what the character is wearing at the beginning; the player must have the information from the dialogues.\n\nIn the English versions of Pirates! you are never able to tell what the character is wearing at the beginning; the player must have the information from the dialogues. During the second chapter of the game, after Captain Morgan has been rescued, he enters the saloon and, after listening to Shaggy's song, the saloon will disappear and turn into a pirate ship with Morgan. The game is set on this very ship.\n\nIn the original version of the game, one of the first questions that Bayou Billy asks his wife is if the crew's treasure is real treasure or fake. The answer to this question can be chosen at the end of Chapter 2, but this is not the case in the international versions. The answer that Bob gives to Bayou Billy is that they found that treasure after they landed on Isla Perdida.","token_len":558,"entropy":[2.8187,2.2824,9.3937,4.2337,1.8981,7.1214,1.266,3.4994,7.6747,2.9745,1.0118,0.1375,2.7217,0.4453,7.8383,1.7597,0.4463,2.7051,7.4799,4.9531,2.5232,4.4244,5.0824,0.6312,2.5943,6.7376,3.6764,1.7287,0.4634,8.6829,3.8894,6.8328,1.3503,6.4781,8.6366,2.4875,5.5185,3.2722,5.9963,2.2124,0.001,1.6788,2.7359,0.3352,4.8189,2.0761,1.0425,1.3691,0.5863,0.4871,0.6591,5.1029,0.7974,1.0507,1.7038,0.1633,1.422,0.0005,3.6564,3.8297,3.4017,1.7107,1.6094,1.9856,1.8174,3.4442,1.7605,4.2706,2.5587,1.7666,5.5218,2.3693,3.8233,2.7941,0.4181,3.6218,1.5384,2.6164,2.4727,6.6028,3.4471,1.757,3.9089,3.425,0.8742,1.3123,0.0015,4.1045,1.03,0.7677,0.7325,2.2221,4.6698,1.5066,2.8412,0.0303,3.1795,2.3646,4.882,3.898,1.6382,3.1206,0.4246,3.5893,1.4947,1.026,2.0478,0.9556,5.5512,4.9621,1.2472,6.5582,3.8478,7.0743,4.9191,3.5354,0.0793,1.3399,4.9756,5.7223,4.4956,0.0363,2.4553,1.7464,1.5915,0.417,0.1861,0.5107,1.6956,1.969,3.1227,4.7871,4.0908,0.8001,5.8737,0.5319,0.2379,0.8762,3.9665,2.4542,0.6956,4.1916,4.6122,0.0286,1.6605,0.0004,0.1282,5.5035,0.3709,5.7592,0.0108,0.0003,1.1593,1.3309,0.0002,1.7779,1.141,2.2554,5.813,6.4221,1.1623,1.8658,0.717,4.6115,0.1556,0.1891,3.7325,4.3303,2.5558,0.9759,2.4786,0.4652,6.0649,1.3308,0.3117,5.3826,1.7909,5.809,3.918,3.9852,0.6414,1.1993,3.892,2.0965,4.6693,0.4756,0.1198,2.2984,2.8511,3.2446,2.4226,2.1545,5.3061,3.599,1.4175,0.0054,2.1202,2.4569,4.9146,5.9068,4.946,1.492,2.3981,3.9117,0.627,4.3066,0.477,5.7017,5.3497,2.0212,6.9694,0.5548,4.2274,0.3782,3.6727,0.2085,0.1243,3.6595,1.5361,3.1651,3.9569,1.3645,0.2108,4.0408,3.252,2.0141,0.1942,0.4445,5.1199,0.158,0.1127,5.706,0.9407,1.9108,1.2446,0.9347,1.3211,0.0002,4.6646,0.9045,4.0603,4.3608,3.2872,0.497,0.6708,4.368,2.1112,0.0133,0.989,3.4204,0.0954,1.2258,2.5891,1.0771,5.2122,2.0857,2.1858,1.8803,1.0243,3.9607,0.6189,0.2948,1.2303,6.4318,3.2458,1.3619,1.3133,0.0249,0.0235,3.5718,0.2017,1.196,0.9551,0.8904,4.4394,2.8878,0.883,0.9985,0.0017,2.6495,1.6774,4.7797,1.5378,0.884,0.1364,0.7266,0.564,6.1401,2.0011,2.6012,1.0829,0.2994,0.3639,1.7612,6.3461,2.6296,3.4525,5.2533,0.2849,3.8642,2.2772,2.9307,1.0091,5.9358,0.8755,0.106,1.5671,2.0011,0.9476,3.9498,5.6153,3.0365,2.4161,0.3356,0.6891,1.0056,2.2202,2.1882,0.9875,0.6276,3.4067,1.3841,0.2086,0.0464,1.0069,3.246,1.5527,6.7342,0.8017,0.0523,1.226,3.4949,3.385,2.8458,4.3353,0.0608,0.5106,0.2903,1.8074,0.0054,0.0389,0.5407,0.4596,0.0002,4.506,3.2338,0.0004,0.0005,0.0552,0.0002,2.6275,0.6222,4.0543,3.6565,0.295,1.9311,0.5081,6.5015,2.612,3.8231,1.2864,0.002,4.6852,2.5047,1.2725,3.4156,1.649,2.6587,3.923,1.8321,0.9798,4.5018,1.9292,3.1919,2.2366,5.1711,1.3504,3.9891,1.6105,0.5251,4.8766,1.5535,1.473,0.836,0.0002,3.3151,0.265,0.7532,0.1069,0.0402,0.1264,0.0827,0.6169,0.1784,0.0177,0.0083,0.001,0.0041,0.0095,0.0032,0.002,0.0029,0.0005,0.0018,0.0008,0.0023,0.0016,0.0012,0.0013,0.0024,0.001,0.0008,0.0004,0.0011,0.0012,0.0003,0.0,0.0009,3.8923,0.3542,5.3642,3.4026,0.819,0.3283,0.2053,0.3079,2.9082,5.9973,2.5618,1.9086,0.5935,3.3659,0.5174,2.5218,5.5652,0.7552,5.3851,0.0061,1.1675,4.9622,1.602,5.6362,0.0543,6.6857,2.4986,0.0212,1.7259,3.1462,0.2606,3.0756,3.6659,0.0021,3.5566,4.0481,1.3493,5.5016,0.1686,0.3634,1.7073,0.226,3.1012,3.8875,3.9017,2.5918,2.6853,2.631,3.2448,2.247,2.2297,5.4694,1.1089,0.7228,0.3669,0.0002,2.0413,0.2176,3.3425,1.8647,0.2647,0.4525,0.1605,0.2003,4.7958,0.1567,0.1349,4.3949,4.5005,2.4723,5.764,0.0672,0.0212,0.3,4.209,4.4491,0.7019,2.5023,2.6491,4.495,4.4112,4.4414,0.5802,2.4029,3.2252,1.1563,1.5137,0.6587,2.0085,0.8699,1.9232,0.2675,0.2158,3.5649,0.3722,4.3164,1.6908,0.6823,1.7888,0.0538,2.3508,1.5855,1.7587,1.887,3.0095,1.7346,0.8486,1.7667,1.1983,0.1577,0.1065,3.716,0.3807,0.7004,2.9506,1.2799,3.7111,5.6294,0.6269,1.4037,0.5836,0.0027,0.0058,0.7865,1.6456,2.2301,3.11,6.1393,0.8129,4.3614,2.2121,4.1875,0.5579,5.4173,0.0022,6.9836,0.8935,0.0276,0.5218]}
{"id":361,"ended":false,"length":494,"gen_text":"Lock Haven was laid out as a town in 1833, and it became the county seat in 1839, when the county was created out of parts of Lycoming and Centre counties. Incorporated in 1850 as Chester County, the population grew by more than 1,000 to about 6,600 in 1865. In the 1870s, the area was predominantly rural and poor, and poor quality brick houses stood on the hillside. The first fire in the county history occurred in 1877 and lasted for three days.\n\nThe county courthouse on Black Run was built in 1913. The county cemetery contains three mausoleas, two marble cemeteries with two monuments, and one earth burial ground. The county home and office were built at 1313 New Brook Road with granite exterior. The state road, which is now called Route 618, was named after the Black Run Valley Road (originally known as the New Brook Road) in 1913. The new road was paved, and the county office and county building built, on the site in 1922. Other buildings include a brick warehouse, a school building with a clock tower, and a police station. The county was also the county seat until 1925.\n\nIn September 1930, the last member of the American Legion from Chester County was laid to rest in a plot in the county cemetery. His name, however, lives on in a county park. He may be the only one.\n\nIn 2004, the population of Chester County totaled 8,395. The area's main employer is the Philadelphia School District. Chester County is home to about 10 colleges and universities, including Temple University, Philadelphia College and Temple-Lindenwood University. It has also become one of the most densely populated counties in the nation, with a population density of 6.4 persons per square mile, more than three times the national average.\n\nPennsylvania Turnpike\n\nIn March 2004, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Authority completed a $700 million project to connect the Turnpike to the Northeast Corridor, the Pennsylvania Turnpike to Atlantic City and the Delaware River, and connect the Erie Boulevard Tunnel with the Delaware River Parkway. During construction, about 250 workers were on site. The project ran nearly two years.\n\nThe project was funded with proceeds from the transportation construction tax, part of the federal gas tax, and from tolls charged by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Authority and other businesses and residents. The Turnpike Authority's project to connect its system to the Turnpike system in Pennsylvania began July 1.\n\nOther roads, such as the George Wallenberg Memorial Bridge in Lower Burrell, opened in 2004 and the Robert Doherty Memorial Bridge in Lower Burrell opened in 2005.\n\nOther sources:","token_len":558,"entropy":[10.725,5.055,7.9465,0.4,2.5283,0.5135,5.3456,1.6657,2.2706,4.1484,1.1507,1.3005,2.5957,3.2724,2.0109,1.9966,0.0054,0.8279,0.3306,3.5525,2.1559,1.3028,1.533,1.5772,1.1729,2.2862,3.2068,0.0036,4.7099,0.0029,6.5394,0.1569,0.9817,4.6298,0.2025,0.1457,8.9774,0.4407,0.6722,2.9793,3.105,5.2999,0.1572,0.0801,1.4604,3.7625,2.3359,3.6691,2.333,0.0027,3.1005,0.0487,0.3981,3.4304,2.8453,2.9155,0.0441,3.2188,0.7375,6.6966,0.5428,2.2716,2.1272,2.4307,0.7852,0.658,1.2183,3.4935,1.0647,5.4555,1.9417,1.7451,3.0559,0.715,1.0613,6.0248,6.3464,5.3458,2.4854,3.4141,2.1359,1.6542,3.7426,0.5994,0.8182,1.8915,2.8242,4.888,0.9714,0.5578,1.4072,6.4185,0.5209,0.3269,0.4333,2.7847,3.067,4.2477,1.8359,2.2588,0.4193,0.287,2.0613,0.0071,1.612,2.6035,2.5672,4.5483,6.1041,4.0833,2.1724,0.6678,0.131,5.7978,1.1466,1.2334,2.0601,5.6909,4.3785,4.6513,2.5674,0.0336,0.001,7.4435,1.2003,2.4057,4.9116,2.2794,0.2131,0.0005,0.0,4.057,3.8665,5.052,0.7438,0.6242,1.8362,5.4782,0.461,1.0542,0.4034,1.2132,1.8054,5.8824,2.2711,2.4828,2.7273,0.7149,4.4766,4.6902,4.0688,5.715,5.75,0.6571,7.2603,5.6983,3.2969,1.6534,0.948,5.4824,4.6429,3.134,2.0725,2.8681,1.8489,2.926,1.9308,3.4773,4.4587,0.1086,0.8016,2.0171,1.3514,0.8841,3.2372,0.0383,5.4556,1.9404,3.6782,4.3416,0.0018,2.41,0.0134,1.1006,3.7012,0.1219,0.3419,0.9664,1.582,5.728,0.2484,1.5008,5.2483,0.6821,0.8185,3.5209,4.4926,0.6974,1.2845,1.7029,3.183,2.1843,1.286,3.8508,5.367,3.9643,2.491,0.7433,0.9473,2.9557,3.7477,0.0688,5.7824,1.4717,2.3373,1.6355,5.6678,4.9381,0.7523,0.8245,2.8773,1.7579,3.6151,0.9895,4.7871,0.126,0.2557,0.8976,0.5725,4.5091,0.3636,0.3998,1.457,1.2022,4.6424,3.6744,1.1814,2.5098,0.0183,2.4724,4.8996,0.7824,0.5494,0.0002,1.7932,5.3654,4.9362,0.1728,1.0101,5.6178,4.8312,0.0058,0.1662,5.8894,1.1022,4.3435,0.8372,0.0606,1.3632,2.1399,0.0096,0.0021,0.978,1.4073,3.2751,1.5862,0.4942,1.1986,0.3478,0.3073,4.4326,0.4755,3.9742,4.0173,0.0035,6.3045,0.0944,0.3761,2.1013,3.6237,2.7847,1.7708,4.2922,7.2473,1.7656,1.7426,1.6214,2.9245,2.6602,0.6986,0.0002,2.1854,5.2934,0.1072,1.0455,6.0464,0.5502,0.1591,0.0271,5.1298,3.4226,0.161,6.692,0.6584,1.418,4.8465,1.8626,3.8768,4.2761,0.5322,0.4961,5.2709,2.4739,0.0243,1.1128,2.2176,0.1815,1.5327,2.1082,0.0073,2.6753,3.8931,3.9262,0.3114,0.0726,0.6856,0.6249,1.5637,0.0957,0.5089,5.091,0.7746,3.8584,2.3534,7.2361,6.1327,0.2458,0.1878,0.7287,0.1741,3.2073,2.4362,3.7553,2.091,3.2224,0.0079,0.1004,1.7993,2.5463,0.1016,0.3382,0.0463,0.5542,2.3701,1.4185,0.3776,2.2193,0.6188,0.1456,0.1591,3.669,2.1244,2.9204,1.4661,0.0332,0.1699,0.0243,2.2675,3.1906,0.0232,2.4397,0.0387,0.4518,0.3824,0.0275,0.1173,0.7315,0.0002,6.0283,0.0135,5.1908,0.0003,0.0152,1.1597,0.0002,2.8565,5.0739,3.5551,0.0279,0.7359,0.3097,0.0079,0.0,0.0006,0.7125,2.567,1.3581,0.7438,5.5145,0.0759,1.5838,0.6584,3.8908,1.1073,1.4308,0.0003,0.0011,1.3292,0.9521,3.7609,0.3214,1.8283,2.3279,3.4308,0.0177,0.0,0.0012,1.3399,6.1951,0.0904,1.0031,0.7576,2.2897,0.5249,2.6239,0.2324,5.3127,0.4752,5.2451,4.3199,3.6942,2.0809,0.3119,2.9006,0.4103,3.3352,0.3998,6.1653,1.1846,0.0914,3.8822,4.8798,3.5073,0.4753,2.4126,0.9734,2.3153,1.2252,1.2026,6.2447,4.8704,2.7753,0.1436,2.2703,0.8327,0.0002,1.1983,2.145,1.4972,1.9338,1.9092,5.2392,0.1174,0.5138,5.7455,4.5553,1.3304,1.5091,5.4376,0.0028,0.2514,2.2349,1.4978,0.028,1.5439,1.4677,3.954,1.6135,0.3649,3.505,1.9826,0.9348,1.6843,0.0526,0.0,0.0017,0.4445,1.8798,2.0168,5.6269,2.4101,3.057,0.4326,1.1195,1.9811,0.0003,0.0034,0.2882,3.2058,4.4614,2.8012,1.93,4.1074,3.7429,0.6393,0.4511,5.0162,0.0011,0.0051,2.9177,1.8627,3.1251,3.0351,6.2182,0.9897,4.0404,1.169,0.0002,5.2522,5.3878,3.6559,2.38,0.0037,0.462,5.461,7.8419,7.8607,2.044,1.4256,1.7625,5.2444,2.8486,0.0105,0.7451,4.8904,0.61,2.1663,2.1706,1.4477,5.725,6.5273,0.959,0.6638,0.0918,0.2864,2.0341,0.7402,0.0009,1.0226,0.2369,1.2214,0.0691,0.8615,0.0002,3.9251,5.3173,1.0938]}

{"id":1131,"ended":true,"length":497,"gen_text":"Biographers Fraser and Navarro wrote that Eva Per\u00f3n has often been credited with gaining the right to vote for Argentine women. While Eva did make radio addresses in support of women's suffrage and helped set up the Comisi\u00f3n Popular de la Defensa de la Mujer del Emperatriz (Communist Women's League) in the early '30s, she was not a supporter of the women's vote.\n\n\"With the help of [the Chilean Communist Party and the Uruguayan Communist Party], Eva Per\u00f3n helped form the Comit\u00e9 Popular de la Defensa de la Mujer del Emperatriz (communist women's league) in 1938 to support the Women's National Federation [founded by Mart\u00edn Galsin, with which she fought on behalf of women's suffrage]. She was asked by a group of women to be a secretary, giving the Comit\u00e9 Popular de la Defensa de la Mujer del Emperatriz the necessary independence from the Communist Party, and to help in getting women's rights taken seriously in Spain, so some of the other female leaders wouldn't make too much noise,\" Fraser and Navarro wrote.\n\nWomen's suffrage activist Maria Fernanda D\u00edaz, daughter of poet Federico D\u00edaz, says that while the Peronist movement wasn't perfect, its support for working women in Argentina helped to build social cohesion.\n\n\"Peronism helped make the relationship between men and women more equal in Argentina,\" she says. \"We got two days off a month that women in Argentina had never had before. We had child care facilities like we will only today, and that's something the Peronist feminists fought for, and I think the movement really had a good influence.\"\n\nBut for the women who did fight for the right to vote, their fight was never over.\n\n\"When my mother died, in her 80s, in 1973, we felt that those days of struggle were over. I was like, 'OK, it's finally over.'\" says Maria Fernanda. \"But it wasn't.\"\n\nFernanda says that over the years she has come to see her mother's political legacy as being less about rights and greater about a commitment to fight for women's rights in Argentina.\n\nThe women's movement in Argentina had a major impact in Latin America and the broader world for decades and years. And then, the world's women woke up. They had to fight for the right to vote again. As she spoke about voting during her first press conference in the White House, President Trump made it clear that he sees voting as a privilege -- one they should fight for -- and not a right that all people should enjoy freely.","token_len":559,"entropy":[7.1605,11.0717,3.0825,9.5937,1.1852,3.9669,0.8243,10.6155,4.081,0.8076,6.1086,4.2599,0.591,4.4685,0.4093,8.899,1.4398,4.4333,0.2399,3.7407,1.4614,3.7619,0.625,1.7824,4.6351,4.5293,4.5381,4.3604,10.9219,3.799,1.7515,1.5491,0.0083,0.6163,0.0913,0.857,0.0006,2.6473,3.9985,4.503,0.0426,1.0371,4.4965,2.1082,0.0023,2.6895,1.4077,0.7333,3.8108,0.1253,0.0144,0.7358,0.2711,1.4886,0.0109,4.7306,5.9125,1.1056,0.7751,0.0213,0.88,4.4687,0.0453,0.7003,0.09,0.8337,1.939,0.5604,2.2018,1.6871,4.5702,0.9354,0.0249,0.0652,1.2181,1.4043,1.2313,1.6525,3.3265,0.0484,1.3972,2.3725,0.0202,1.9073,0.8328,1.6583,0.0037,2.0334,5.412,1.058,3.9724,0.0198,4.6452,2.072,4.9271,2.6742,0.3916,4.0699,0.9846,5.094,0.0017,0.0017,0.529,0.0498,0.4892,1.4719,0.3027,0.1761,3.7604,4.2154,0.5965,0.7428,4.2741,0.0547,0.3337,0.0837,0.4808,0.0044,0.0009,0.2152,0.0232,0.0082,0.0053,0.1717,0.0246,0.0068,0.0005,0.0009,0.933,5.2721,0.0167,0.1147,0.0065,0.2362,0.9195,0.4491,4.6302,2.7176,2.9606,0.6043,5.5882,0.0142,2.6756,4.6132,3.3158,3.394,1.1445,5.7913,2.3082,2.6346,5.4976,4.6733,2.7563,4.5532,3.1375,1.3361,5.4956,4.7953,1.8546,0.0068,1.6021,0.5828,0.8543,0.001,2.5452,2.232,1.8103,5.5835,1.4241,3.4352,2.4418,0.0888,1.0542,1.1734,3.3131,2.2137,4.8874,2.0155,7.2451,2.2114,1.2165,0.0753,0.189,0.7543,0.0057,0.0133,0.001,0.0009,0.133,0.0042,0.0041,0.0013,0.1532,0.0033,0.0015,0.0001,0.0004,1.0436,3.6858,5.0831,3.0401,0.307,1.9989,0.2274,2.592,1.8149,2.8624,2.4718,3.3945,4.6401,2.0046,1.1965,2.3884,5.6711,1.1171,1.5631,4.3663,3.0484,3.52,7.7117,0.8618,0.5763,4.048,5.3302,1.5411,5.945,0.0011,5.3054,3.9031,0.7477,1.7763,1.7775,1.3917,0.3054,0.0023,0.0003,0.1304,0.1484,0.251,0.0002,5.6916,0.8891,0.9047,0.0078,4.2073,3.1923,3.996,0.0515,4.5066,0.5092,0.054,1.9365,5.063,0.0281,5.4176,1.2589,0.0053,0.4345,0.0017,0.0007,0.3367,5.1151,1.4525,2.9291,2.4154,2.2931,0.6791,0.6421,1.4263,4.9233,0.0005,5.0526,0.2185,3.6454,3.4964,0.4463,6.0686,0.5954,3.5106,0.6563,3.0488,2.2232,3.5121,4.4437,2.9092,0.8737,0.4343,0.0002,0.1552,3.3605,0.4179,0.6542,2.7713,4.1738,2.0428,5.7384,0.0837,2.1623,0.0087,0.0124,1.4731,1.0902,2.2594,0.4804,1.3379,1.1767,0.8558,0.1022,0.2615,3.7089,5.253,6.3907,4.3089,0.5946,2.1814,1.4381,5.8563,2.7099,1.8838,1.1323,1.9494,2.8279,0.5816,0.4709,0.8949,1.3589,1.4908,5.8018,0.5106,3.8555,5.4641,1.7256,8.5062,5.8492,4.6289,2.2002,0.8194,3.828,2.169,1.6488,3.7413,2.6209,0.0709,0.5739,5.9184,2.4453,0.1343,2.6827,1.9073,3.047,0.6752,3.3209,3.5832,3.489,3.869,0.5353,2.9054,1.3095,1.9346,0.0603,0.0002,3.2252,4.1075,2.8569,1.7285,1.0394,3.2011,2.4816,0.2755,0.8443,1.9144,0.027,0.0243,0.2189,2.5631,3.1058,0.9601,2.8903,0.8923,0.0674,1.1143,0.0002,1.0395,3.3791,4.8176,0.9523,1.622,0.8943,2.599,4.4876,2.3509,0.0304,0.0784,2.0739,3.9198,0.0682,3.3013,5.2312,1.4857,6.429,2.5977,1.6877,1.4248,0.4409,0.9314,1.8898,2.7537,2.1226,4.942,0.5227,0.4119,3.4786,0.1315,2.8875,0.2257,5.1882,0.2829,3.1012,1.8733,2.7051,1.7216,0.0024,1.2154,0.3304,0.968,2.4786,0.8329,0.0003,1.85,0.1899,0.0002,4.2984,0.4545,0.0255,2.2228,0.7941,4.9881,0.2689,0.9877,2.9934,1.148,2.9005,0.0366,1.6319,2.4536,0.1847,0.5882,3.6784,1.2772,0.6722,3.5614,4.3563,0.5394,4.7423,1.0196,7.3368,0.0467,3.5295,2.9924,0.0281,4.8782,0.3962,2.151,0.08,0.9783,2.4118,1.1146,0.4084,0.4415,0.0002,4.6866,2.6871,0.669,0.9848,1.2774,0.0893,3.5673,1.7488,4.341,0.8856,2.5207,3.2776,0.0649,2.2877,1.6992,5.3343,0.236,4.8476,1.6693,4.5871,3.5629,1.144,2.8891,4.7179,0.878,3.541,4.9902,3.9619,4.149,3.7275,0.0114,1.0493,4.8802,3.1941,2.7255,2.1525,1.0948,2.1786,0.8756,0.0298,0.1111,1.7233,0.383,5.3205,6.1698,4.8365,2.5727,6.0139,5.1453,1.9573,4.2184,5.0054,0.0689,1.9913,1.7409,1.0678,0.0011,0.7186,1.4926,2.1341,3.8248,1.5436,0.1662,0.349,0.9946,3.5566,2.7293,0.3941,0.5887,0.3814,6.5395,2.5562,6.6217,1.4834,4.5071,0.4961,2.8959,1.6491,1.1101,0.6017,0.1687,2.6182,2.436,1.9634,0.5676,1.8153,7.1273,0.0638]}
{"id":2869,"ended":false,"length":485,"gen_text":"Limits involving algebraic operations can often be evaluated by replacing < unk > by their limits ; if the resulting expression does not determine the original limit, the expression is known as an indeterminate limit and can be replaced by the expression < zero >. Indeterminate limits need not be replaced if they make the program shorter.\n\nThe general way to evaluate a limit is to use a combinator called the inverse-comparator, which is overloaded for lists and vectors: [< l > >. < max >, < l > >. < min > ] is called a binary limit.\n\nA binary limit that has one operand with two (or more) components and the other operand with zero or one is known as a non-deterministic limit. The general form of such a limit is < c >. < min > where c is another constant (the number of components of this limit) and Min and Mnd are functions that return 0 otherwise and 1 otherwise, respectively. As Min and Mnd return a finite limit, they are also known as finite limits of the other terms of a limit. In fact, for any non-deterministic limit with two or more components, the function Min and Mnd can be written in terms of Min + (Mnd < max + 1 ). These limits are commonly called deterministic limits. (See the description of these limits under Determinacy.)\n\nAs we will see, limits are a lot more general than those we have seen so far. In particular, we will see limits that operate as lists, matrices, vectors, and other mathematical objects like polynomials and logarithms. If we study further the concept, then we can introduce a new class of limits, so that limits in this class will behave like general linear functions; they will all have the form [ x 1, \u2026x N ] with x 1, \u2026, x N being matrices or vectors whose elements are integers and whose matrix product is the limit of x 1 \u2026x N. For example, the limit [ x 1, \u2026x N ] will be an array where the entries define the values of x 1 until x N, so that the number of elements in the limit will be the number of row entries (N = 2) plus column entries (N = 2) plus the number of columns minus one (the first element is at row 2, N = 1).\n\nWe will cover limits in more detail in Chapter 5.\n\nSee also limits in Categories.\n\n9,11,12,14,15,17\u201318,23\u201324, 31\u201332, 43\u201354, 55, 58, 60\u201361, 82\n\nReferences","token_len":559,"entropy":[3.8048,10.864,9.7353,0.0914,3.0239,3.0813,4.6705,0.1894,6.3208,2.5837,5.0241,8.6075,10.0401,5.9323,3.485,1.1533,5.659,5.7545,7.5163,4.2455,1.5296,4.1371,3.2184,2.9917,0.0404,8.0642,1.0659,4.918,1.6627,0.3844,1.5946,2.4535,0.7837,6.403,1.0619,1.4581,4.9364,0.0169,0.0406,0.3799,2.599,2.294,0.3249,2.6813,0.2726,1.7216,2.9627,1.8063,5.4187,0.863,1.4695,3.5652,0.0294,0.07,0.0935,6.5595,0.2901,0.4939,1.5439,2.7467,1.5917,6.1202,1.234,4.2191,2.8218,1.5109,1.1226,0.0024,1.9819,4.782,5.3203,0.4297,1.8258,1.8514,0.7264,0.5283,1.0312,2.6207,2.3632,5.29,0.0269,3.8491,1.6322,5.5141,3.4264,1.987,2.7688,0.8451,1.8449,0.5265,1.5876,6.281,1.9145,4.925,1.21,3.2929,2.2325,5.3291,1.9916,5.5991,0.9627,6.185,4.4558,0.7756,4.7579,0.3084,4.9799,0.3069,1.2877,0.4606,0.839,0.119,0.0935,1.1645,0.006,4.7184,3.0852,4.1138,1.5257,3.7317,2.7565,0.9915,1.7374,0.0002,2.6671,1.7651,0.0445,4.389,3.388,3.4264,3.5229,0.0011,4.1767,4.689,5.8289,0.8371,0.1719,0.0285,3.6924,2.9202,2.3296,0.4139,0.5376,0.0209,0.4981,1.6583,1.6098,1.2787,3.0904,3.0997,0.0072,0.3509,2.7273,0.2323,4.9465,0.4729,0.0079,0.1506,0.3464,2.2231,2.7859,1.0162,0.3243,1.7805,0.1623,0.0261,0.1215,1.6379,4.8734,0.8386,0.9166,0.1839,3.0606,0.0971,4.0223,0.5516,0.2268,4.5828,3.7396,3.2092,3.1276,2.4394,0.1846,0.679,2.2887,5.344,0.3086,1.3545,0.6576,7.3328,1.398,5.124,3.5325,0.186,3.5527,0.7155,1.2006,4.5969,8.0268,1.3769,0.8329,0.0462,1.3218,0.0226,0.1699,5.6549,4.2706,0.7705,0.0166,0.0012,3.8267,2.274,3.9779,5.5544,0.4312,1.8377,1.1017,3.075,2.2441,0.0115,1.503,0.6255,5.2628,1.5333,3.7345,6.3357,1.7928,2.5559,1.2551,0.6497,3.614,3.4993,0.0663,3.6379,1.7758,2.488,0.0052,0.0747,0.0287,0.0006,0.1722,2.8811,1.7661,1.9462,0.0633,0.4347,0.2439,1.2021,3.7778,0.4114,0.8892,0.0231,0.0014,1.8437,0.146,1.351,1.9023,0.6121,0.0017,2.8381,4.1636,3.9391,0.6937,0.5649,5.1424,3.3058,6.0144,0.6513,5.1929,4.1146,1.7167,0.5331,4.8478,1.0239,2.1266,0.0027,0.5549,0.3917,4.6376,2.0885,1.7963,4.3166,0.083,4.0614,0.3076,3.2251,3.6986,0.019,2.7644,1.3359,0.1267,0.0002,4.214,3.9927,2.2656,0.1135,1.1271,3.2532,1.4936,3.2575,5.8825,0.5999,1.7578,0.079,3.7154,1.5989,0.7659,1.4239,0.2717,0.0003,0.309,2.6848,0.7862,0.0321,1.8074,0.7787,1.0255,1.9638,0.9732,4.2045,5.375,3.0849,0.9993,6.084,0.0002,0.1402,2.6639,0.1517,0.8464,2.1279,4.2932,0.7255,5.8383,2.4446,0.0001,0.004,0.0001,1.3549,5.2878,0.01,0.0003,0.0152,0.2156,4.984,1.6964,5.4127,4.9703,2.3515,3.4033,4.6012,4.8895,0.2771,2.1319,5.4293,2.3308,1.3135,2.3303,0.0819,0.4089,1.5498,6.6483,1.8682,3.0809,3.6006,2.4492,1.1494,1.7147,3.6622,1.3373,5.7345,3.6034,1.1335,4.6501,2.3826,0.6082,4.6579,1.3031,1.1469,1.9178,2.0272,4.5007,2.0141,4.0689,3.0186,4.5859,2.6496,0.5495,3.9972,0.4136,0.6474,1.8521,0.0341,0.5369,0.0859,0.0258,0.662,5.5508,0.0073,1.7339,0.8433,3.8649,1.6768,0.3382,2.806,2.4321,0.5422,4.8567,4.127,0.2153,1.6294,0.7984,1.6684,3.4245,0.5495,3.9613,0.3948,0.0118,5.4551,3.3757,0.4996,0.0348,1.0392,0.4468,0.7539,1.7499,0.2431,0.3325,0.4024,0.2079,0.2234,0.2059,3.7673,0.3798,3.4641,2.4614,4.6347,1.2082,3.3001,7.4029,0.5791,3.1128,0.1191,1.514,0.119,8.1449,1.0426,0.0102,4.8728,4.4906,0.6747,1.1547,4.8305,0.0535,1.3415,0.9913,0.3894,2.6099,2.3931,0.2878,1.2832,1.1761,0.0439,6.0925,1.7754,3.0145,3.3952,3.2201,2.0108,0.4983,2.5732,5.6461,0.036,0.0619,0.2553,0.0228,1.8936,1.2424,0.815,1.1162,1.0323,0.0148,3.0678,4.3642,0.8207,0.9005,3.4879,3.495,2.0875,1.5973,2.9931,2.161,2.9268,0.972,6.0518,0.1549,0.411,0.656,1.2704,0.0002,2.7088,0.8354,5.9825,1.6707,0.8066,1.2925,0.0713,0.6397,2.2744,2.9234,0.9591,1.0581,0.0002,4.7262,0.4709,5.088,2.0519,5.958,1.4957,0.2406,0.0002,4.0952,6.871,4.5222,1.0999,1.7794,0.4827,2.0492,0.2419,1.1574,0.408,1.5103,5.6413,1.592,0.3363,2.7168,1.1046,0.7705,0.287,5.0689,0.7228,0.2246,0.4174,4.057,0.7182,5.1847,0.5019,2.2948,1.3014,3.2917,0.6893,2.3467,1.1025,1.0341,0.2192,4.8449,2.4564,0.0002,2.3979]}
{"id":3214,"ended":true,"length":526,"gen_text":"In 2003, Middlesex was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. The Pulitzer Board wrote in their report that Middlesex is a `` vastly realized, multi @ - @ generational novel as < em'as one that engages the imagination to the limits of its capacity.\n\nThe book is widely regarded as the second most memorable novel of the 20th Century. It's been re - published as several major books. In 2004, it won the Gold Medal for best novel at the Writers and Readers of America.\n\nIt is a coming of age story where young people at the bottom of society find a way to turn their lives around. The rich play with the rules, and the powerful abuse the rules. It is a story of redemption and revenge, of the human spirit winning over the human heart.\n\nIt is a book of extraordinary prose.\n\nHere's the official synopsis from Amazon:\n\nThe story starts with an ordinary, middle-class girl named Grace, who, upon graduation from high school, is given an opportunity to work at the local post office. After a short while during which her world comes tumbling down around her, she is given the opportunity to leave the office for good and move to the city of Rome, which is about to collapse.\n\nBut Grace isn't destined to join the city slickers. When her father, who believes he can save the city by taking on the reins of a failing bank, asks her to take care of a family friend, Grace is appalled by the request and turns it down.\n\nWhen her father then asks her to marry his sister, she refuses, but when she thinks about what it means for her, she begins to reconsider. She starts to understand that if she gives in to her father's demands, she'll never leave the post office; at the same time, her soul may not exist without the post office.\n\nIn her apartment, where she's struggling to make ends meet, Grace learns about her mother's death and starts to take responsibility for her own life. She's also developing feelings for her friend, who's still an employee at the post office.\n\nShe's at the right place at the right time. The post office is about to completely collapse under the weight of too much debt. Grace's father has loaned millions of dollars to the bank, but his loans are being paid back with interest. If that doesn't happen, his wife and daughter will be penniless and likely homelessness.\n\nHow Grace can help her mother and her friend save the post office and, in turn, help the city is the mystery of the novel itself.\n\nIf you are interested in reading this book that won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, I recommend reading our book recommendations.","token_len":559,"entropy":[6.4269,0.2382,12.0877,0.2155,4.5486,3.5907,0.991,6.251,0.0236,0.3202,5.2099,1.2858,2.219,2.9236,3.7295,4.9917,2.4568,1.5528,3.9994,1.3137,5.4558,0.0001,3.3101,2.2023,8.4785,15.7457,9.5496,2.381,5.261,16.4316,5.7908,7.4542,9.9982,2.1995,6.4668,7.795,4.7881,10.1679,7.2258,4.8027,3.3891,5.4451,1.6131,3.6109,4.0254,1.1091,4.7155,0.2937,1.0526,1.2975,1.8668,5.3318,0.0504,2.0942,2.1955,1.4966,5.9136,2.3743,0.1245,2.1742,5.6316,2.0801,6.0467,1.9288,0.7191,0.1873,1.1895,0.0257,1.5443,0.7923,1.8112,4.1974,2.0029,5.1615,3.4135,2.1366,4.6032,3.5288,5.7715,3.0469,2.1485,3.215,2.7894,0.2335,1.9747,1.9513,0.2114,5.3207,0.0937,1.3027,3.6781,0.9246,1.3318,0.0541,5.9654,3.7636,0.5147,2.0993,0.1989,1.4895,0.9184,0.0002,3.7907,2.0971,2.1002,6.0054,0.5218,0.0084,0.2362,5.5818,3.0742,2.6189,4.8501,1.1805,4.43,0.0987,1.3108,3.0604,1.5777,0.6216,0.4075,4.6629,0.7815,0.6033,0.0578,0.8452,2.359,6.5041,4.9007,4.1192,1.5512,3.2652,1.0538,1.9618,0.4081,5.0036,3.5065,1.105,1.4329,0.5689,2.7444,1.1363,0.6614,1.1786,0.8485,3.0955,1.1784,4.8228,1.349,1.4257,2.3016,3.9568,0.6409,5.2572,1.5754,0.3432,3.6038,0.8177,0.3596,0.5383,0.0002,2.9067,0.7258,0.9062,2.1526,1.6277,4.5084,4.7039,1.8413,2.4575,0.0002,5.4821,1.2127,1.4319,3.2184,0.6249,1.8585,2.0604,0.6923,0.2218,0.0002,2.3726,2.9278,4.5312,1.1746,3.029,2.8885,2.7885,2.2055,0.6704,0.0929,3.2027,1.2394,5.3942,1.6377,0.7297,3.4922,4.8092,4.1921,0.2111,0.6384,0.01,0.0847,1.6915,2.7491,2.4523,1.831,0.5573,3.224,1.6489,1.4092,2.7484,3.9693,0.0219,0.5594,4.1226,1.3889,3.015,2.4415,8.5215,0.0879,3.1227,4.9566,4.2193,4.5447,0.0149,0.1671,1.2424,0.008,0.1343,0.9465,1.5994,1.8217,1.2452,0.9767,0.0867,3.0992,1.2648,2.9796,2.8415,0.774,1.4744,2.4257,0.9442,1.8697,1.7295,2.2002,5.6552,0.7001,3.034,0.9289,2.875,0.8129,5.1453,1.7964,1.2515,0.0002,3.9417,1.2614,3.3824,0.0048,5.1948,0.3212,4.8016,0.211,2.4872,4.4322,0.8532,0.9203,4.2261,2.0273,1.8588,2.0032,2.2746,6.8878,2.3117,2.2703,2.5402,0.8731,0.4771,1.4389,3.6668,2.9574,0.8595,6.1224,0.0721,2.2068,1.652,1.7067,0.116,4.5509,0.2938,0.1204,2.7422,3.5273,0.0025,1.4805,4.222,1.965,0.9824,1.6942,1.9522,5.2198,2.2279,0.4042,2.7263,1.8988,4.133,0.8639,0.0058,0.1764,1.3228,0.0002,3.8007,1.3697,0.6352,5.3392,2.211,0.1941,0.1034,1.8627,2.5588,5.0754,0.7341,1.1578,2.1583,1.4926,2.1294,2.8236,1.4161,5.8205,1.672,2.9118,1.9429,1.5876,1.9834,0.3926,2.8034,0.412,4.1467,0.0415,1.6428,0.2555,2.6898,4.5163,0.751,3.8883,1.0242,4.0805,0.6173,4.9137,0.723,0.4235,0.4836,0.3421,0.2278,1.1483,0.2745,0.8595,2.1525,1.7423,4.4496,0.9314,1.316,0.0178,3.6157,6.5534,0.9695,0.4942,0.0081,0.1042,2.6364,6.3181,2.9266,3.6374,6.6116,2.0744,0.8442,0.8238,0.0076,0.5025,0.5026,0.0002,2.9919,3.3007,5.6913,0.5724,3.8614,0.4266,2.3802,4.528,0.2885,1.5794,0.4108,0.0045,0.4973,1.1596,4.1594,2.2314,2.2279,2.9265,0.6579,1.7064,0.9933,5.3452,0.2269,4.8272,2.5759,0.0325,0.4237,0.929,0.2734,0.1881,1.308,3.3975,2.6156,4.4484,1.55,0.0359,1.2741,3.3308,1.1759,2.3365,1.7471,5.0324,4.7014,2.0002,0.528,0.0204,0.1054,0.0075,0.3494,0.9902,0.0002,3.6287,2.0051,5.0115,1.4066,4.8126,0.1393,0.2485,0.0027,0.0144,0.0076,1.5022,2.6557,1.0739,0.0175,0.5112,1.2752,0.004,7.273,0.3294,4.082,0.3918,0.14,0.0027,5.6123,0.544,0.3682,1.2004,1.7805,1.8935,0.994,2.0917,4.7439,0.0005,5.4556,0.5227,0.0513,0.2056,0.5072,0.595,0.9041,1.4936,3.9524,3.4886,0.7192,3.4593,1.9138,0.4166,1.4686,0.191,0.7376,3.3641,4.1445,2.5845,0.0007,1.921,0.1794,4.0796,5.7898,0.9826,1.3951,0.2756,1.0047,4.2203,0.0004,2.09,6.33,5.8528,0.1395,0.5779,0.0002,5.6697,3.8258,2.1623,2.0037,1.7042,3.6061,0.5865,1.5015,0.1488,3.0979,0.6806,0.404,0.0062,1.8188,4.6609,1.2027,1.7593,0.0079,3.6699,1.9821,0.6943,1.775,0.7691,3.75,0.784,1.1729,1.2237,6.6021,0.1419,0.6645,0.0002,4.2983,0.1792,3.4668,1.1561,0.0877,1.2115,1.6767,0.4544,6.325,2.7747,0.2615,0.3395,0.3635,1.0043,1.7466,0.225,2.0899,1.8132,3.3912,6.289,3.0564,2.9058,1.5925]}
{"id":1008,"ended":false,"length":504,"gen_text":"In July 2000, McCall accepted his first coaching role, when he was appointed assistant manager to Chris Hutchings at Bradford City, after Hutchings was promoted from the role to replace Paul Jewell.\n\nHe was in charge of Bradford City until January 2000, when he was sacked because of serious underperformance. McCall also resigned as manager of Oxford City in 2007 in the wake of a dispute over the club's direction.\n\n\"With everything that has happened, I've been very fortunate,\" McCall told BBC Radio 5live on Monday night.\n\n\"I've got to thank my dad and the people who've supported me along the way.\n\n\"I had some bad luck in life; a lot of bad relationships came my way, but I'm very lucky to have had a pretty good one.\"\n\nMcCall's career in football has been marked by controversy. He signed for Bolton Wanderers in 1992 before returning to Sheffield Wednesday, who were owned by fellow Scotsman David Murray. He left, however, in 1996.\n\nMcCall's second stint at Arsenal came during the Invincible season of 1996-97, when he won the club's first league trophy on 29 May as they lifted the League Cup.\n\nAnd his time in London was to serve as a springboard to the North London club. McCall, who was also playing for England in the World Cup qualifiers then, went on to become manager of League One rivals Millwall, and then West Ham.\n\n\"I could always say that I've managed here or been at the game,\" McCall said. \"What will now be fascinating to analyse will be my next move. And when you're at that club - and, by the way, I was once a player - you are always prepared for that.\"\n\nMcCall's next challenge will be at League One Bury, who visit Blackpool on Saturday (17:30 BST).\n\nIf West Bromwich Albion do not win the FA Cup on Saturday at home to Chelsea, they will be fourth-bottom with no automatic qualification from the Champions League.\n\nMcCall was left in charge of the Bury side last month until a meeting with the owners, the Fawaz Al Hasawi group, was postponed.\n\nBut Fawaz said on Sunday that he had full confidence in McCall.\n\n\"It is all about the team now for Ian and I think he understands that the players we have recruited over the last three to four years have got us up to this stage,\" Fawaz told BBC Three Counties Radio.\n\n\"It is about us getting results, that's why we are here now and Ian is on his way back and we are delighted with what he has got.\"","token_len":560,"entropy":[5.663,5.0887,0.1597,9.0271,2.771,9.9936,4.0219,2.8718,4.3039,4.5889,2.1239,3.998,0.5013,0.6511,3.0045,1.9786,5.2671,2.3594,4.8771,4.795,0.9317,1.1132,4.7146,0.2882,2.035,4.3391,3.2228,0.0075,1.5119,3.2483,2.3728,0.9325,1.6356,8.9173,4.4251,3.9143,2.8053,0.0072,0.5685,0.7455,0.0012,2.0181,1.8037,3.9397,0.29,1.0711,3.3033,1.7665,2.4545,2.8531,4.8028,0.4905,0.6306,0.2545,0.5905,2.7683,5.5768,0.4695,7.1117,6.0439,2.4148,0.7442,3.1367,0.0016,4.8828,3.3585,0.9439,1.9279,0.1885,4.9917,3.0523,1.3794,6.8051,4.8191,0.9849,0.4409,0.0023,0.9584,3.4768,1.5978,1.6288,0.7784,0.0708,4.5037,0.4009,0.1927,0.0003,4.2774,5.4432,5.4721,0.7896,1.0958,0.3874,1.8955,0.7455,2.3358,1.8774,2.6468,1.4177,1.7014,0.8802,0.0012,0.8596,0.224,0.9044,0.9127,4.4813,3.3468,1.3744,2.7005,0.0476,0.4625,0.0003,0.1662,0.6095,0.7837,2.3793,2.4057,1.9667,2.048,6.0622,1.6186,3.0251,1.9268,1.1397,2.2894,0.9842,0.0217,3.7596,0.0419,0.0281,0.6396,1.1223,0.0003,0.0446,0.8679,4.0051,3.395,3.6697,1.5798,1.881,2.7644,4.5956,3.1863,0.8613,0.0585,1.9538,6.4478,4.6872,2.4884,0.0003,1.6047,1.1572,0.659,2.1495,1.4539,1.4873,0.9345,0.4989,1.0952,1.6623,5.8859,0.5743,3.7168,2.4153,0.1624,0.0003,1.9339,0.0007,2.106,2.4776,1.5415,0.6473,3.6427,1.0135,2.7198,0.0468,2.532,0.7129,1.5649,5.674,0.5059,5.0735,0.5836,0.0014,0.6357,2.9491,2.798,3.6492,0.127,4.604,0.4246,2.014,2.6757,2.7306,3.6604,0.1041,5.3211,3.9594,0.1144,1.9716,1.1529,0.9295,2.8491,2.3889,5.9742,0.8,0.0018,1.6897,2.0331,2.6814,0.1038,0.0004,1.5804,0.0005,2.7016,3.6639,2.757,0.7142,5.7901,2.3964,3.6332,0.58,5.3953,2.622,1.0451,0.394,1.5508,0.1561,0.0555,0.4295,0.6985,0.468,2.5983,0.4071,2.9143,0.0317,0.7219,2.0612,4.6186,5.2052,6.2804,1.1486,4.6403,0.9959,3.717,0.0362,3.8634,0.0262,0.575,0.2738,0.0003,5.3651,2.8979,2.5879,2.2954,2.7982,1.52,3.7491,7.3551,0.5295,0.455,1.9351,0.01,0.9306,2.4234,4.974,1.2462,0.4652,1.6681,2.5621,0.0003,3.5445,0.592,1.8037,2.8692,5.4208,0.4261,4.8362,2.5222,0.5991,2.0069,0.014,2.0389,5.898,0.1899,3.932,0.2424,0.0288,2.3763,1.5388,0.4877,3.8751,0.3596,6.1499,3.4669,0.0,1.9556,2.4361,1.7409,4.9245,0.225,1.311,0.1321,0.0004,2.4873,0.8209,5.4361,4.0836,2.491,1.928,0.6447,2.9341,4.9379,4.3753,2.6081,2.8184,2.2168,2.0278,5.4827,1.2371,0.9446,0.0009,0.4767,0.2559,0.508,5.7116,5.5112,5.7736,0.9214,5.5495,1.5562,4.7846,3.1388,0.0534,2.8461,5.5324,1.4309,1.0288,5.488,4.4749,2.1407,1.5823,3.1183,2.991,2.4699,4.6934,1.7177,5.4526,4.2628,0.2874,0.0474,0.0143,1.0859,1.8223,5.4081,1.6114,1.2867,1.0499,0.8073,3.9695,2.2486,5.2821,1.6181,1.3773,1.0758,0.3414,0.0003,1.0979,0.0005,1.8954,3.6389,3.1251,0.9077,0.3639,2.3716,3.1575,0.7494,4.3609,0.1687,0.2458,0.8244,5.7559,5.2945,0.0023,0.2889,0.7791,3.0632,2.4792,0.0162,1.0543,0.5819,0.3431,0.8992,0.0003,5.8026,5.2089,2.1838,1.338,0.0337,2.7234,0.7897,1.243,1.8252,1.8682,0.0064,1.7715,1.2823,3.8701,0.7907,0.138,3.2045,0.2212,1.4563,0.5588,1.4672,4.2267,2.2855,1.0819,4.046,3.6015,3.579,1.9448,1.1927,0.158,2.9615,0.0077,1.0895,0.6055,0.0004,1.3452,0.0007,3.1371,5.8295,3.0609,0.3248,0.2648,1.8608,3.7456,0.0171,0.9644,2.9664,2.7477,5.4183,2.5942,4.025,0.4413,1.2033,5.1696,1.4549,2.8399,5.2082,0.31,0.2726,0.2663,0.0027,3.2464,0.6329,2.1213,1.9237,0.9991,0.4957,0.0003,4.2419,5.8647,0.0009,3.1196,1.2541,2.1665,0.8228,1.0998,1.7932,6.0035,0.0743,0.0682,0.25,0.0004,1.2725,0.2346,0.0003,0.2915,3.2138,1.7437,4.994,1.0983,1.7096,2.5816,3.8706,5.3811,5.654,1.876,1.5364,3.8749,0.6849,4.249,0.6939,3.7845,2.4526,4.9279,0.4358,5.8064,3.3653,0.0392,0.5328,3.1004,3.8284,0.0527,1.402,0.8313,2.9124,2.7704,4.4501,0.9692,2.2748,2.0898,0.3705,0.5969,0.0004,0.9544,0.122,5.7113,0.005,0.0002,0.0029,0.0392,0.2174,0.0003,0.2243,2.7107,0.5963,2.2542,2.8803,2.3367,3.8365,1.8672,3.4828,1.2406,3.0211,0.774,2.0197,1.3219,2.5771,1.6988,2.5958,1.3453,4.9605,2.7935,0.1664,1.2604,4.0312,1.8053,1.1705,3.2944,2.4074,2.2633,0.6744,0.6977,3.0636,2.1702]}
{"id":2597,"ended":true,"length":510,"gen_text":"In 1907, Spokane's board of park commissioners retained the services of the Olmsted Brothers to draw up a plan for Spokane's parks. Much of Spokane's park land was acquired by Olmsted Brothers in 1910 for the new park site on the east bank of the Columbia River.\n\nIn 1908, the Spokane County Board of Commissioners adopted resolution 1 to purchase several lands west of Clark Avenue and east of West High Street.\n\nIn 1910, Spokane's newly formed park system was established.\n\nThe City and County of Spokane have operated the Spokane County Park System since August 15, 1909, when City and County Charter authorization was granted. (For more details about the park system, see How Was the Spokane County Park System Established.)\n\nThe Spokane Park System's Board of Commissioners is made up of seven members: Chairman, Commissioner, Vice Chairman, Secretary, and Treasurer.

{"id":625,"ended":false,"length":534,"gen_text":"`` Obsessions `` was Diamandis'first single, released on 14 February 2009, and `` Mowgli's Road `` followed on 13 November 2009. She chose the song as an `` uncommercial \" choice since it was in the top five of the first US iTunes chart for hip hop songs in 2009, according to the Associated Press, although she has denied that the song's success was due to its radio placement. `` My obsession has been music for as long as I can remember so I wanted to make something that didn't sound like a radio hit, or at least something I haven't heard before,'' she told Australian blog The Mary Sue. The first track from her third album,, was released on 14 February 2009, and '' followed on 13 November 2009. She chose the song as an ``underground hit `` choice since it was in the top five of the first US iTunes chart for hip hop songs in 2009, according to the Associated Press, although she has denied that the song's success was due to its radio placement. However, there's a problem with the equation: Diamandis has said that her obsession with popular music has given her the strength to achieve great things and that she will continue doing so in a way that is acceptable to her. Obsessions is hardly a radio-friendly song. On the other hand, one could also argue that her previous albums lack the radio appeal she has now. Diamandis said \" 'Obsessions' was the first release that I had produced without really knowing what I was doing at all. At that point, it was the first album where I thought, 'What am I doing?'' I felt like I was living in my own little dark world, where it was just my own obsessions that kept me going on. When I realized that this is how my whole life works, that I'm making music based on what I're excited about and that my obsession is my life, I started to realize how different my life was from just being obsessed with music. I was like, 'OK, I think I can write music that makes it possible for people to love what they're passionate about.' That was when I had, what I felt like, at that point, something I could call my new career.\" Her album will be recorded in April 2010 at the renowned Abbey Road studios in London.

{"id":4782,"ended":false,"length":482,"gen_text":"Principal photography took place in Vancouver, British Columbia. The opening sequence was filmed outside at night, though the subsequent scene \u2014 Lucy's interrogation and execution \u2014 occurred in a motel set in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nFilm studio Cineplex Entertainment Inc. acquired the Canadian-based U.K.-based production company for Canadian theatrical distribution in February. The first teaser trailer, released earlier this month, features an interview with director Tom Tykwer, who shares anecdotes about his experiences on the set.\n\nThe thriller tells the story of four American special spies sent to South Korea, where they're tasked with bringing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (Jo Han Lee) down. To this end, they enlist North Korean defectors (Lee Sang-in, Lee Min-seok, Lee Jong-guk, and Lee Jeong-jae) to gather intelligence, conduct covert operations, and break into the hermetic country's most sensitive facilities.\n\nThe film, which cost about $20 million, will open in North America on Feb. 14, 2014, and its box office performance will provide early indications of whether Universal Pictures can make inroads in the Korean market, where foreign-language releases often struggle to open big.\n\nOther new films that have opened earlier in North Korea (in the order of opening weekend grosses) this year include \"Mystery of the Frozen Ghost\" ($13.9 million), \"Monster Hunt\" ($13.1 million), \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" ($20.2 million), \"Annie\" ($16.4 million), and \"Dope\" ($15.8 million). By comparison, the film that has opened number one in North Korean theaters is last year's \"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children,\" which grossed about $17.6 million upon its release in February.\n\nAccording to the Korea Film Council, North Korea's film industry has seen steady growth over the last few years \u2014 with a 7.1% jump in the number of releases per year from 2012 to 2013, and a 13.1% surge last year alone. The country's film output was estimated at 25 to 30 films during the 2012 fiscal year.\n\nDespite its box office success, \"Snowpiercer\" has faced international criticism. Critics found it boring, featuring dull and unimaginative plot twists.

{"id":3089,"ended":true,"length":466,"gen_text":"Principal photography began on 23 April 2012, with the filming of `` Who R U? `` featuring Mahesh and Aggarwal supervised by Prem Rakshith on a set at Annapurna Studios in Hyderabad. Other stars in the film are Dibba Dastoor (Sadhana) and Arpita Agneshwaram (Jani).\n\nMahesh Roshan, a film maker and a graduate from the Film and Television Institute of India, had been keen to make this film since the early days. He had sought the help of producer Aditya Mukherjee to find cast members and for the financing, after being encouraged by actor-director Rajkumar Hirani and the chairman of the Kolkata Screen Association (KSCA), Rajeev Massey.\n\nFor `` Who R U? <\/em>, the filmmakers have cast Mahesh's brother Mahein Roshan, former BJP MP Mahein Saifuddin, singer and actor Preetam Dham, and former cricketer and former Indian cricket team manager S Sreesanth. The other three performers are Bedi, Gaurav Kapur and Anushka Sharma.\n\nThe film's screenplay, by Dhillon, has been based on Kripayini Ramachandran's book, `` What Does Your Wife Do When You're Away? \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd which had stirred up a storm on social media.\n\nMahesh, who is associated with the film, said today the film had ``been in the making for over a year as they had always thought of it.'' The actor said ``he will only be making seven more films in the cinema space before retirement.'' The actor went on to say that the film will also feature a ``big name star'' but would not be ready in a year. ``The film will be released in September, and then we will do the rounds,'' he said.\n\nThe actor is one of the few Bollywood celebrities to have made it big in the foreign film business. In 1993 he starred in the critically acclaimed romantic comedy movie, `` The Wedding Gate `` in Germany, winning the coveted Gold Golden Bell award for best director. Two years later, he starred in the romantic drama film `` The Chink of Redstone,'' as well as the politically charged comedy film, `` The Marriage of Figaro,'' all of which became winners at the Berlin Film Festival. He has acted in several films such as `` Badlapur,'' `` Bajirao Mastani,'' `` Dhoom 3,'', `` Kuch Kuch Hota Hai,'' and `` Bajirao Mastani 2.0`` and is known for his witty, and sometimes provocative, turns on screen.","token_len":562,"entropy":[0.5014,5.371,2.5963,1.5994,7.8694,2.5885,2.4812,1.6309,1.4213,1.6858,3.8174,0.4407,13.378,13.6112,6.8534,5.0567,0.5854,2.2042,6.6389,8.5092,3.7399,0.0164,4.0983,9.7494,0.5264,0.0015,12.3472,0.0354,7.4084,10.4654,0.2102,5.3003,4.8671,3.3658,5.3062,2.1961,8.5147,0.7482,0.0076,0.0009,1.7722,1.0452,3.7436,0.0009,0.3472,5.9234,4.3732,1.2915,0.1623,0.3069,1.1483,4.53,2.5338,6.4355,2.2349,5.1966,1.0569,2.1191,3.8213,4.348,0.439,1.6624,0.2472,3.896,4.2678,0.2369,4.9781,5.2612,0.9734,1.2739,1.6551,0.183,4.1158,5.4614,0.8921,1.7313,0.1178,3.8235,0.0023,0.0018,4.9099,1.6857,0.0038,2.2449,3.8481,4.3634,2.6874,1.8028,1.828,4.0925,1.1583,0.9577,1.8395,0.5154,0.0139,0.004,0.0434,0.0157,0.7578,3.1749,2.8327,4.4239,0.7758,0.9751,3.2734,0.3059,1.2782,1.9849,1.9687,0.8083,1.132,1.4116,0.9651,5.0678,1.3072,1.5838,0.0282,4.8506,4.8757,0.7675,0.0036,3.772,0.0472,0.0273,1.7289,3.7232,6.5479,0.4452,1.659,4.1114,1.5081,3.415,3.4318,4.4672,4.1895,4.3489,0.08,3.7476,1.7617,0.7154,3.1727,0.8398,0.1677,0.1191,0.0033,3.0618,3.243,5.2665,0.0865,0.786,5.4861,1.4619,0.0015,6.018,2.9261,2.3373,0.3707,2.0899,0.0047,0.4821,3.1822,1.9368,0.0112,3.1956,3.7956,0.252,0.8438,0.0002,4.0285,5.91,0.3332,0.0143,0.0204,0.0556,8.5211,5.1695,0.8082,1.9911,3.4189,2.29,2.7923,3.9259,0.0041,0.0014,1.8592,2.9452,4.5374,2.0957,7.0697,3.4861,0.001,0.0021,1.2251,4.797,5.2822,0.5919,2.7388,1.7476,2.925,4.4801,1.2192,0.4724,0.4613,4.4904,3.0312,0.8867,4.0331,3.4955,3.5858,3.9062,3.526,2.8933,1.8773,3.6523,2.5334,0.0,0.017,2.2657,2.8953,1.9258,1.6167,1.1253,2.4762,3.5154,2.4887,0.199,0.0018,0.2596,2.6366,4.1098,4.421,4.8416,0.7043,4.2204,5.0376,1.139,5.3508,2.5885,0.0348,2.5512,0.918,0.7545,3.5256,2.2907,0.053,0.5479,0.1828,0.5742,0.0002,2.1253,0.8485,2.5362,3.2844,2.8422,1.7381,4.6755,6.2484,0.0007,0.4044,2.0079,0.5324,3.6686,0.0234,6.4266,4.7095,8.0665,4.4836,4.4861,1.1549,0.2322,0.0036,0.0378,1.4224,1.7861,0.1654,4.2874,4.5437,3.053,3.8555,1.6058,2.0212,0.4764,0.758,0.6224,0.1951,4.9787,1.7823,2.3382,3.5312,5.6327,1.945,0.6814,2.0046,2.8495,0.7754,0.1194,1.6158,0.9691,0.0002,1.4641,0.0192,0.0014,2.3228,0.6494,1.3245,6.1323,0.0231,1.286,1.7727,1.8137,1.3653,6.4261,3.9229,0.4872,2.9806,4.5227,3.3724,3.0488,0.2042,0.6671,0.2088,2.9958,0.9544,0.3303,5.7689,6.1024,1.5161,4.4191,5.1304,1.016,1.844,3.3505,3.0088,2.7936,0.9666,3.0913,5.4982,4.1508,5.9507,2.1644,4.5103,6.9996,1.2682,0.1061,1.7828,0.8007,5.4454,4.634,2.5259,3.7704,0.9063,3.728,0.7421,6.059,0.0478,0.0444,0.5191,0.7874,2.0018,0.9721,1.8721,3.5304,2.4316,2.5617,2.4901,3.0696,2.4768,3.1431,0.8876,3.5269,2.7787,0.1957,1.5042,3.7141,2.167,2.2464,0.4112,0.7266,1.5939,2.7021,1.3843,0.9717,0.711,1.8943,0.8042,4.1418,2.2376,2.4893,2.6775,1.4667,0.2708,4.2167,2.0557,4.951,2.1745,0.2823,0.2557,0.107,0.5285,0.0002,1.9828,1.4074,3.5048,4.5541,0.0409,0.1715,2.4081,2.0676,0.0247,2.1058,1.3662,0.6472,2.5839,2.2697,0.4324,0.4889,0.6435,4.1597,1.1894,2.0282,0.5101,2.7764,3.6598,2.7863,1.6229,0.1539,0.6928,4.0112,0.1289,5.2125,1.2723,4.2703,0.9144,0.0751,2.936,2.0641,5.0017,2.5821,2.6821,2.9237,1.3709,5.1739,0.7681,3.9834,3.8788,5.265,7.0182,1.6152,1.4169,1.0125,4.2208,0.5445,5.3953,0.0552,0.0549,0.4838,0.3584,1.2994,0.093,0.5318,2.0791,1.2985,1.3581,1.3666,2.3461,5.8019,1.9265,1.0316,4.3445,1.6417,3.3813,4.8778,0.6265,0.0657,0.9502,5.5741,1.3083,2.7992,0.7673,0.9488,0.0136,2.2614,5.0027,0.4657,0.4429,0.0038,1.2613,4.8982,1.1089,0.03,4.6579,5.5727,0.8701,0.2796,0.6077,0.9057,0.0222,0.1802,2.1314,1.7929,4.2864,0.0548,1.905,1.5257,3.1307,0.0038,0.2337,5.9299,1.6026,0.0027,0.9297,0.0952,4.6132,1.9131,0.7535,0.0001,0.0199,0.0018,0.4318,0.1671,4.6193,0.5481,0.1917,5.9157,5.245,0.127,3.4792,2.3069,0.0842,0.0021,0.0009,0.0012,0.015,0.4673,1.496,0.4233,4.2583,0.5089,0.2422,0.0003,0.1374,0.0003,0.5436,2.143,1.2852,5.1721,2.8744,1.7992,3.319,0.2441,0.2757,4.9983,2.5568,4.8816,1.2651,4.4052,0.5773,4.3155,2.987,0.9844,0.0487]}
{"id":674,"ended":false,"length":498,"gen_text":"On February 8, 1992, the Ulysses solar probe flew past Jupiter's north pole at a distance of 451 @, @ 000 km. This swing @ - @ by maneuver was not intended as a science test, although the spacecraft was commanded to change trajectory to a point around 740 @ km south of the north pole.\n\nOn February 14, 1992, the Voyager spacecraft made its closest approach to Jupiter with an apical distance of 485 @ km before it passed out of the planet's field of view, and on April 10 it flew past Jupiter at a distance of 486 @ km.\n\nIn the past 10 years, the two largest spacecraft in the solar system \u2014 Voyager and Galileo \u2014have performed various research tasks, including study of our solar system, the Moon s moon, Mars, and Jupiter.\n\nVoyager is a two-ton, flyby probe launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in February 1977 and commanded to the Jupiter system in late 1989. It will orbit Jupiter, travel to Saturn, and then return to Earth.\n\nGalileo is the second instrument of its type sent to Jupiter, and is about the size and mass of a small space shuttle. It was launched atop a Titan III rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Base on January 5, 1990, where it flew through the Earth's magnetosphere, which is so cold that it only allows certain low-energy particles (mostly ions) to pass through without any loss of energy. Galileo is intended to study Jupiter and its environment over a two-year journey.\n\nIn 1994, the New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto, the last distant world discovered by the Voyager spacecraft in 1977. New Horizons is projected to travel until January 20, 2014.\n\nThe New Horizons mission was originally scheduled for launch in January 1987 at the beginning of the Space Shuttle Program, but was delayed due to problems with computers on Launch Complex 13. The launch was rescheduled for 1985 at the beginning of the Space Shuttle Program over a year. The Space Shuttle program ended in 2011, and with the cancellation of the Space Shuttle, New Horizons has been delayed.\n\nIn late 2005, the Galileo mission was cancelled when one of its four reaction wheels became unusable.

{"id":2316,"ended":true,"length":506,"gen_text":"Casting = = = Jeethu had initially approached Mammootty to play the lead, but he was unable to commit and asked Jeethu to proceed with the film with another actor. According to the movie 'Nosy Crow': \" The production team felt sorry that we needed to cancel because of budgetary restraints. After several attempts Jeethu was finally cast for the role in the film.\nAfter Jeethu's audition, he was introduced to the principal actors of the film and was asked to make light hearted comments in the film.\nJeethu told us at that time that he has no problem meeting new people or acting with strangers. This led to him being invited to the set of the film.\nWhen I asked Jeethu about the process, with which he got cast, he said he is a very shy person. As a result he rarely met anyone in the group until he was introduced to Mr. Lai. He was then brought to the set, and got introduced to the rest of the cast, and became part of the team.\nNow that Jeethu has his role in 'Udta Punjab', the producers in this case have managed to get Jeethu to come back to the cinema screen and work with his new teammates. So there was no reason to cancel the shoot of 'Nosy Crow'! The producers will see Jeethu only now and then, and do a final shoot.\nIf you are interested, you can click here to read my article where the same is reported in English.\nWe could never believe as they had never asked for a handover of the film to Jaipur, and he had already made the decision to go with Jaipur and did not want to see his work on the silver screen in Pune, but somehow they decided to go ahead with it! We never doubted him again after I gave him a piece of advice:\nAsk the filmmakers to call you first to make sure that there is enough money for distribution!\nBut it is just a matter of time till Jeethu makes it big again.\n(Note: Jeethu has been quoted as saying here, that not even the producers at Jaipur felt the need to cancel the shoot. In any case, I am not sure about this, since I was not in the studio at that time. But I suspect it is true. If you had visited Jaipur just a few days before we saw it, you would have thought that this kind of film would not be shot there.)\nYou can follow my postings on my blog, where I post about interesting stories and rumours of the city.\nIf you like this post, please share it and comment!\nLike this: Like Loading...","token_len":562,"entropy":[7.3651,7.4594,9.2411,2.1885,14.6536,7.3856,3.1826,7.612,9.0342,5.7857,13.866,6.8398,0.182,2.444,3.2857,1.2537,3.1953,2.9023,0.4542,2.5654,2.0692,3.1588,0.0704,1.6251,3.4297,4.2624,1.3162,0.0078,0.0004,0.1762,8.2977,1.9036,0.8448,3.8494,4.776,5.0799,0.4391,0.408,6.5892,0.0055,2.3094,5.0804,7.3137,4.9589,5.364,2.1341,2.3632,6.139,1.1922,5.9239,4.6989,1.7768,4.2597,6.2203,3.1951,4.0431,4.3789,1.8054,5.1125,5.0741,0.9156,6.2538,5.073,0.909,4.5642,4.453,2.6477,4.1637,0.0017,0.0008,2.3386,1.0321,2.44,4.6122,0.2052,0.8296,4.4886,1.0726,1.1579,1.1476,3.054,7.4146,2.0515,0.0032,0.0002,1.3237,3.7076,0.8534,1.8456,1.1227,4.4528,0.1519,1.2686,4.7889,1.9247,2.7252,0.1586,0.2665,1.8052,2.1801,1.8745,0.2201,4.4633,6.8118,4.637,0.0038,2.1191,2.3422,0.7532,0.9533,0.6128,2.9711,1.7586,0.002,0.0006,4.6034,1.7039,4.5655,2.0711,0.2364,0.5665,0.5799,3.9873,2.7709,2.9444,6.3923,5.9177,0.3109,3.3857,3.342,1.2895,3.2497,0.7751,4.3048,4.1063,0.3762,2.3643,1.3605,2.6986,0.3201,1.6446,1.9135,1.0823,0.2951,0.2904,1.4235,1.2145,3.3528,3.0324,1.4514,0.63,0.0042,0.0002,1.0332,1.1583,5.2861,3.1757,8.1586,2.4639,0.2692,3.1271,1.9526,1.5406,0.1647,0.7555,2.0702,4.7825,1.529,1.5876,2.7957,0.2829,1.4109,4.7249,1.1675,0.7709,1.2174,5.3278,3.3013,1.9619,2.5696,0.5396,6.1055,3.8635,1.0499,1.2539,1.491,0.1169,5.24,0.6359,5.3667,3.0894,1.0066,1.9955,1.9335,2.4699,4.8296,0.632,0.389,0.7414,3.1096,1.6453,4.9815,2.3997,0.0623,0.6935,2.4184,0.0289,0.0276,0.4712,3.0923,1.2793,3.9951,1.6929,0.0029,0.1136,1.2706,0.375,0.6785,6.1499,1.9365,1.3844,0.0022,0.0003,1.0266,5.4075,2.5591,0.8453,2.2202,6.1832,2.2653,0.1578,0.0066,0.3317,2.8699,4.0043,6.1385,4.446,1.5403,1.4848,5.9156,0.0364,2.1703,2.1075,0.0025,0.0006,0.6551,2.9456,1.1507,0.8056,1.1846,5.4309,3.8981,2.6189,4.0407,0.5558,3.4555,2.817,5.2634,0.644,4.8695,4.0703,3.5622,0.5754,2.6943,1.218,0.9019,0.3446,1.7951,2.489,0.959,1.2947,0.0057,0.0005,0.0246,0.7736,4.556,3.4029,2.7366,4.1234,5.4111,1.6709,0.0019,0.0009,5.8376,6.348,2.5634,1.483,1.4937,1.4677,5.0698,2.3424,2.1398,3.378,1.8343,1.0394,5.0451,0.4958,1.5647,1.0205,2.656,0.8989,0.1323,4.6701,0.4858,0.389,1.2894,3.5676,2.559,4.9458,4.7261,4.6865,2.7735,3.9715,1.5825,4.7686,0.6855,0.9002,4.8096,5.6,4.1947,4.3089,7.0674,5.3237,3.111,3.7337,4.4144,1.5636,2.5447,5.5642,3.9975,0.814,0.6557,1.3674,1.8302,4.8775,0.6485,0.0484,2.0832,1.8706,5.7963,1.2232,3.2393,3.317,1.8069,2.076,0.2774,1.9067,2.7856,2.3926,0.0041,0.0004,3.478,4.3541,0.1797,0.8552,0.1697,4.0287,1.6446,3.3409,3.8067,0.8471,3.2839,0.0052,1.8749,5.335,0.1232,2.8216,3.0811,4.6415,2.53,4.0303,0.1831,2.8747,0.494,0.5986,1.6025,2.3191,2.9305,4.3706,5.2508,2.7414,2.9161,3.5921,6.2162,4.5891,1.1336,1.5251,3.9953,0.0155,1.0758,2.7344,2.7811,6.1945,1.6245,5.3457,1.1229,4.721,0.8774,3.3353,2.8967,2.8782,0.0822,0.98,3.1681,0.5057,4.5838,1.2109,1.4104,6.1497,3.8671,0.7452,4.3884,3.2538,1.753,4.3882,1.559,1.778,0.0049,0.2177,2.7089,2.681,0.0118,0.0014,3.545,2.3617,1.0743,2.6241,1.7141,2.0162,4.1816,4.1495,0.2205,3.3607,0.0058,0.0022,2.2026,2.0882,3.7225,1.3237,0.1088,4.9312,2.5982,0.9801,7.089,2.8719,1.888,2.1948,5.0695,0.6825,0.0033,0.0004,6.1455,2.758,0.4115,0.1508,2.1808,0.1792,0.2555,1.9436,4.1063,4.8251,0.076,0.3037,2.9094,2.0473,1.1888,0.7706,2.225,1.1503,2.0266,2.4713,1.5299,2.2188,0.5506,2.1307,0.8494,3.6358,1.5253,0.6774,0.1035,1.3252,2.0336,1.5129,5.6206,3.0547,1.183,1.6071,1.7497,3.2417,1.7748,5.5008,4.1584,1.078,0.0011,0.0009,5.5452,1.6396,0.622,0.2746,1.0472,6.3675,3.9995,2.755,0.4659,0.3671,0.2155,0.2333,5.2735,0.7304,2.9549,6.0305,0.0038,2.7091,2.742,1.3847,1.0391,2.2186,1.1483,1.6223,0.8492,4.7374,0.5461,3.0403,3.3953,4.9355,0.7117,1.6717,1.5246,2.2296,3.5276,0.4644,2.012,2.0535,3.8514,2.9139,1.5813,5.1913,2.6353,0.9568,3.3202,0.9604,1.4911,2.9429,0.0833,2.3579,1.6448,0.7818,0.0921,0.738,0.9633,0.2939,3.5662,2.9447,3.0185,1.2916,4.4548,0.333,0.0929,0.0009,0.0,0.0006]}
{"id":3880,"ended":false,"length":492,"gen_text":"Hamm is an avid golfer and tennis player, and a devoted fan of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) team the St. Louis Blues'; he's even appeared in two television commercials for the team. He is known to hang around the St. Louis Blues clubhouse during home games when he's not working.\n\nBanksy's artwork often depicts individuals depicted as playing sports, but there have been those times where he has depicted athletes of all kinds, including soccer stars. This example is an example of a soccer player he has depicted.\n\nThe image above depicts what appears to be a ballerina being attacked by sharks with two sharks riding on top. Shark attacks are very real events that are incredibly dangerous for those that are hit, with sharks responsible for more than 500 deaths around the world since the early 1900's.\n\nHere is another example of Banksy's artwork showing some rugby players, including several players who are also soccer players. Also included are some players who are depicted with soccer balls and an array of other items, which are also known as soccer balls during the game.\n\nWhile there may be examples of artists depicting professional sports teams and other groups of athletes as some sort of a competition, Banksy depicts athletes in a way that is very unique to him. The sport of soccer is often depicted in a realistic, sport playing (rather than violent) way.\n\nBanksy's ability to depict these athletes without any type of obvious sports reference is what separates him from the other artists that depict this genre. Banksy's depiction of American Football players in a way that is completely different to many previous artists is a testament to his unique style.\n\nBanksy himself is a keen soccer player, and appears on several Banksy.com videos that involve playing football at the soccer field, such as in the below video where he's portrayed as a goalkeeper (as he appears in another Banksy.com video ).\n\nIt seems as though Banksy has a love of soccer, and it is one of many sport's he's portrayed.\n\nBanksy is an excellent artist, and has garnered some popularity not only in the art community, but also the internet at large. The fact that he's been so busy making works of art since 2005, is proof enough that he is incredibly talented. He regularly goes viral, making his artwork accessible to people all around the world, and that's absolutely nothing but a great thing.\n\nIf you want to check out the entire collection of Banksy, here are some links to his sites:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.banksofdoom.com http:\/\/www.banksy.com\n\nSource:\n\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Robert_Hamm","token_len":562,"entropy":[7.27,5.7788,3.279,4.2497,3.711,0.0,1.2207,5.9127,0.2041,1.4308,0.854,3.0869,5.1722,3.0687,0.0102,0.7777,5.8346,1.2316,0.002,2.198,7.6869,1.8982,3.0696,1.3425,3.4702,0.0122,0.0065,0.0019,15.9532,1.1035,3.6744,3.3816,4.9914,0.9764,3.9592,3.8422,0.372,0.3591,0.2407,0.854,0.3037,2.2473,2.4526,4.6825,1.8093,5.2978,1.7826,0.59,2.4982,0.012,0.0089,2.0314,4.9228,2.889,3.7886,0.0973,4.5239,0.889,1.1835,0.1576,2.2698,1.576,0.897,0.0183,5.2882,4.8304,1.902,1.8663,3.7117,3.2538,2.1455,6.008,5.5626,1.0651,5.9912,1.3923,1.1312,2.3445,4.1327,3.4274,0.1758,5.5913,3.2653,1.6051,1.4505,0.9646,1.3469,3.1814,3.7221,1.6849,1.8067,1.5941,1.1815,4.0734,2.8562,1.7122,3.4596,5.9266,1.4668,2.9571,1.474,0.0684,1.8318,1.2467,0.6545,5.81,1.4954,0.8845,1.3281,0.6102,0.0002,2.5353,2.9511,2.4814,2.1277,5.3367,1.141,0.0039,0.0097,0.6295,5.3331,1.6609,0.017,4.2298,3.4206,0.1137,4.692,4.5019,5.3756,2.5768,5.1271,0.7248,1.6804,2.9301,6.3324,1.381,0.5397,2.655,2.5045,4.1632,1.4354,2.001,4.7167,0.9628,1.5197,2.3069,2.0983,0.5824,5.2108,2.5572,4.6146,3.0225,3.9676,0.0092,2.301,0.9112,4.0382,0.7205,3.1861,0.0013,0.0539,2.6704,1.7368,2.5118,0.669,0.7441,0.1531,0.8548,0.0002,4.5343,1.1349,0.9544,1.5325,0.2014,0.5004,0.0007,0.4056,0.9887,4.1011,4.8422,5.8778,0.113,2.9848,3.1128,4.9086,2.9572,2.9049,0.7302,3.9315,2.4495,0.1301,0.3022,6.7455,2.2962,1.1164,1.7778,3.4842,1.3643,0.4518,3.5739,3.0445,3.4922,1.1547,2.4282,5.5337,5.4735,0.0037,1.1881,1.968,2.0964,2.6525,1.8754,3.0013,4.162,0.4502,0.4541,0.2393,6.9507,0.8801,1.3368,0.4589,0.3985,0.0002,4.6601,3.0332,3.5378,0.4781,6.3398,0.2612,4.6023,0.9118,4.723,1.3703,1.556,2.0088,3.4832,3.4649,0.8489,1.3045,3.8405,5.723,0.9823,0.005,4.033,5.1742,0.3934,2.1704,0.0004,6.8708,3.0488,1.9206,1.038,1.8893,0.1068,1.1538,2.7571,3.1304,1.4514,0.7354,0.3611,3.208,4.8607,0.8963,0.1261,0.6064,4.0597,2.3214,1.0799,1.005,4.3576,2.8562,4.9074,7.76,6.4477,2.0257,0.0281,4.0068,0.2091,1.1961,1.1556,1.2706,0.0002,1.5587,0.0061,0.0025,1.1377,5.614,0.0511,1.3602,3.7194,1.3614,5.1814,2.778,4.0652,0.0028,4.8646,3.6813,3.5562,0.9866,2.1608,3.3569,0.2612,0.0889,1.6177,2.1244,0.6797,1.2291,2.2341,5.0412,3.3585,1.3093,3.0553,0.0006,1.2236,2.8746,0.1312,6.8563,2.3753,1.677,2.7195,2.5866,1.934,0.0855,0.5568,3.169,1.0133,3.7144,4.4392,6.0882,1.4396,1.1995,2.3795,1.2769,0.0551,0.3179,2.6012,1.6466,0.7882,0.4361,0.0002,1.6277,0.0103,0.002,5.7478,1.9925,1.1236,5.177,1.3838,0.5736,0.9524,0.6704,5.7499,3.9076,2.4355,2.4124,0.049,2.9279,1.2752,1.5638,2.1931,4.5006,3.7474,3.9108,5.7146,2.065,3.6362,0.5954,3.2383,2.7197,0.0056,3.8492,0.7299,3.8902,0.1044,2.9496,0.2817,3.8176,4.5143,0.9071,0.6801,2.9803,4.6604,3.8012,2.2312,3.1439,0.9821,3.9396,2.6447,0.0059,0.491,0.006,0.0189,4.0661,0.3757,0.0002,4.0622,3.2946,2.2485,0.6248,0.6978,0.0008,1.3911,1.62,3.0233,2.0046,0.7254,0.8883,0.8113,2.6317,1.8149,4.4554,0.1774,3.8371,5.2332,3.2022,0.8931,2.0354,1.7545,1.6961,2.229,0.0002,1.6771,0.0203,0.0025,2.3463,2.8791,4.5935,0.721,0.8483,0.3842,1.9749,4.5757,4.1045,5.9329,4.5651,0.1516,1.0559,0.4883,1.6967,2.2138,0.2977,0.0107,0.8262,2.538,6.099,3.6488,0.0072,0.2358,3.209,2.5285,0.0282,0.6173,1.4905,1.9954,3.6295,5.4275,3.1412,4.8475,1.4104,0.0381,3.3348,3.6912,1.4248,2.5219,3.0509,1.4535,0.8425,0.5763,1.1305,5.0672,0.3776,0.6768,3.2663,5.705,5.0253,5.5912,1.2398,4.4578,1.8639,2.0686,4.3416,0.2041,2.7094,1.2293,1.5794,0.0042,0.154,1.5285,0.6645,3.2739,1.0735,6.3259,4.7509,2.2779,1.0168,2.0881,0.316,0.6817,0.4058,0.0002,2.8633,0.1022,3.5558,0.1003,2.9014,0.0162,2.9733,4.1632,1.3258,0.0815,0.2011,0.0121,5.3706,2.9389,1.1653,0.8764,1.1347,0.9194,1.5648,3.2906,0.7262,0.2816,0.0002,2.0301,0.0008,0.3293,0.002,4.2669,1.9108,3.8816,0.6598,0.0657,0.2751,5.0223,0.0003,0.1439,0.0016,2.6393,0.0531,0.0373,0.2293,0.8511,0.0002,4.8382,0.1567,2.1968,0.0002,0.9751,0.0003,3.0686,0.0048,0.0112,0.0014,0.0004,0.0147,0.0021,0.0006,4.7093,0.0096,2.3766,0.031]}
{"id":2152,"ended":false,"length":480,"gen_text":"The motion of a star relative to the Sun can provide useful information about the origin and age of a star, as well as the structure and evolution of the surrounding galaxy. The motion of a star in its solar neighbourhood is not only interesting because it is the most distant known example of planet formation, it can also reveal how planets are accreting to their host star.\n\nThis latest research using data from the MPG\/ESO 2.2-metre telescope and the 4-metre W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, shows for the first time the velocity distribution in four giant clumps that have been found to have two planets in orbit around them.\n\n\"Our study shows that these objects are quite young, but our finding is also the first example of an exoplanet around two clumps with a gravitational encounter.\"\n\n\"Based on our analysis, these large clumps are probably relatively large planets but that is speculation from what we have discovered,\" says G\u00f6ran Pilbratt of Lund University in Sweden and the lead author of the study published in the international science journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\nThis is the first time that astronomers have found two planets orbiting one another. These planets spin in opposite directions so they orbit at different times, the longer one is around the Sun, the slower the other (the orbit has the same period as the orbit of our Moon).\n\nAstronomers have previously found two exoplanets orbiting the same star but they had no explanation for their positions due to the fact they are situated further away from the host star, which would have led to them orbiting differently.\n\n\"In our case, neither the shape, orbital periods or the motions of the two planets are linked to the structure of the star,\" explains Svenja Hofmann, a co-author of the study from Lund University and University of Amsterdam (The Netherlands).\n\nThe orbit of the planet is highly eccentric, meaning the planet will not be at its most stable in its orbit for too long. Hence the planets are going through a period of extreme instability which could be caused by the gravitational interaction of their host star.\n\n\"Our results demonstrate the large size of the planets around the galaxy cluster 2MASS J23062914+2645390, and also the potential importance of these objects for the future study of planet formation around other clusters,\" concludes G\u00f6ran Pilbratt.\n\n_____\n\nSvenja Hofmann et al. 2016.

{"id":3977,"ended":false,"length":519,"gen_text":"During his Senate campaign, Butler spoke out forcefully about the veterans bonus. Veterans of World War I, many of whom had been out of work since the beginning of the Great Depression, had been told that they would be paid $5,000 per year to stay home because of the war. Many refused to stay home and enlisted to fight for the nation in the First World War. When America entered the war, millions of veterans had lost their right to vote. During his campaign, Butler received letters from veterans saying they were denied $750 per year in government handouts and benefits because they stayed in the military. When the bonus was finally rescinded in 1918, these same veterans fought the Great Depression with a fervor that had only been found once before, with the country's troops stationed in Europe during World War I.\nWith Congress still in session, Butler's filibuster was allowed and he ended up with $13,000 in federal money to use during the Senate campaign. However, after he was defeated in his race to become the U.S. Senator from Indiana, Butler made some of the money he had earned in politics disappear, sending it in a bag to be sold on the streets for $15 a bag. The bag was eventually found in his hometown of Indianapolis. From there, it began its journey to Indianapolis through the various stages of Butler's life. The rest is history.\nA little-known fact: This is the story of the most famous political filibuster in history.\nThe History Channel's television adaptation of\u00a0 The Butler Diaries, starring Jon Voight, is due out in February 2005. The actual documentary will come out at least a year later, in the very near future.\nI wrote my first novel in 1990, right afterward on a trip to Germany and Austria I should have been at my summer camp, but somehow ended up in a book-publishing basement doing research for the first book. Since that time I've written numerous novels under the pen name of Charles W. Butler. In June 2000, I received the John W.

{"id":3191,"ended":false,"length":524,"gen_text":"Norman died of throat cancer on 24 August 1930 at Croydon Hospital, aged 70. Five of his children followed him into circus careers : George and Arthur Norman became circus clowns while Tom and Roy Norman opened a circus-themed bar in Croydon. Roy Norman died in 1958 at the age of 90 and his son Roy Jr. has opened Harry-Con in the centre of Croydon since 1976. In 2004 Tom Norman passed away suddenly due to heart failure. Now his son Peter owns the company.\nHe also produced circus circus shows for the BBC, at the National Circus Centre, and the London Palladium, and has been touring internationally with his unique show The Flying Circus Show.\nHe also had a hugely successful singing career, recording songs for both children's albums and adult records.\nThe first of his two daughters Lizzie married former British Airways pilot Steve Rimmer in 1956, while the second daughter Joan married musician Frank Walker in 1958. His parents, who were descended from the Norman family line, were never granted British Citizenship until 1954, thereby rendering him ineligible for high office during the second world war. His brother Stanley, the oldest son of George Norman and the first Earl of Rochdale, was a prominent Labour member of the House of Commons when he was killed in a traffic accident in the 1950s whilst attempting to drive through a tunnel which was under construction in London. He had been visiting the area for several months.\nNorman was a prolific author: he produced 18 children's books between the years 1938 and 1951 alone, most of which contained tales as simple and silly as the ones he had written for the children's entertainments.\nDespite his well known temper he was described as a gentleman, and as a keen horseman, and was even a noted coach rider. I should add that at the age of 70 his last horse, a Thoroughbred owned by a prominent member of the circus-owning aristocracy, was seriously injured in a racing accident.\nHis death was mourned by many of London's older people and fellow-citizens with a very large number of people going to see his funeral at St Paul's Cathedral. During his lifetime he was widely respected for his humanitarian work, and the Royal Family paid their respects to him by having a small memorial service at their Buckingham Palace residence, with the full court of the City of Westminster attended by several thousand people.\nIt should be noted that the most famous of his children, Roy Norman, was also a famous actor. His famous daughter Joan of Tralee was married to Richard Burton, and his son George also had a high profile career in film and television. I must then wonder... if it is not true that after his passing his children were expected to take over his business after his death?","token_len":564,"entropy":[6.0148,7.1511,2.4295,5.4465,0.0105,2.116,6.22,2.7909,7.1607,2.1901,7.6877,1.2544,0.0135,1.4013,1.1684,4.5145,4.878,0.2727,8.0191,3.5645,0.3094,0.9373,4.2259,0.6834,1.7093,14.3807,7.1143,8.9322,3.6449,4.1708,5.4952,2.7742,5.8216,3.3382,3.1846,0.0099,3.6716,6.2258,1.2767,5.0659,0.6284,3.5839,1.2109,2.2713,3.3999,1.7959,3.2562,1.0124,2.2311,0.0113,0.0018,1.0314,2.3689,0.7694,1.7659,0.7034,4.3477,2.0391,0.1886,0.0353,0.0022,4.2498,2.5671,2.3348,1.0102,2.2778,1.9982,1.1507,4.6327,5.7007,7.6146,6.7342,5.439,3.0806,2.8625,3.8416,0.012,1.0638,0.0035,0.0012,2.4097,3.4494,0.1768,3.5653,4.4932,3.4537,0.1737,2.9723,0.2072,4.1101,4.3071,0.0063,2.206,0.3162,0.8729,6.2286,1.7778,0.5615,4.7282,4.8567,0.973,3.6831,1.092,0.9705,6.5116,2.8016,4.4448,5.3018,5.9787,1.6414,1.8583,1.1896,0.4291,1.7948,5.4201,1.0289,4.1591,1.4423,2.6548,1.6965,2.2211,2.4311,2.9136,2.4012,0.0005,2.025,1.4573,4.5143,1.8857,4.2391,3.0929,2.1256,0.8144,6.3058,2.5834,3.0486,3.7121,0.7376,5.5852,0.7849,1.0927,2.5894,2.5648,3.1801,0.5341,5.2157,0.3362,4.9149,0.0348,0.8518,3.5065,4.0386,0.786,4.8288,5.017,1.2334,3.8009,0.1775,2.2674,3.2678,0.6378,1.4456,2.6353,3.8656,1.4697,1.0084,2.8257,3.9071,6.065,2.1441,0.0074,2.3424,5.7356,3.5023,2.8438,1.0699,5.5166,5.4214,2.744,1.4307,3.9432,1.299,3.4993,0.8221,0.309,0.8555,4.8378,0.2946,5.2539,5.0902,5.7035,0.6471,2.6816,0.1115,3.4379,6.9077,2.3341,3.4972,1.261,4.2508,0.0286,1.4286,0.6677,0.4378,2.8236,0.3563,1.2899,5.2882,5.5642,1.9116,2.7725,5.5982,5.2864,1.3681,6.2575,3.592,1.939,2.0102,0.5626,5.961,0.4554,5.4085,0.3519,4.2757,0.2095,0.0042,0.2187,3.6571,3.1695,5.5146,2.3916,3.0669,5.0943,1.4616,0.8507,2.9569,1.4125,2.4073,3.3218,2.469,2.0147,0.1984,5.2029,0.5485,1.0017,0.1592,1.4073,2.0264,3.6535,4.043,3.8912,0.1188,0.8894,0.2492,0.0061,1.4769,5.8605,0.5234,1.701,2.1647,0.3598,0.9789,4.7527,0.083,0.3365,4.2351,3.2044,0.0364,5.9482,4.0455,0.1117,3.1475,2.1702,0.7701,2.946,4.6912,1.2481,2.1985,0.012,1.9305,1.7487,0.1608,2.7686,2.1775,1.0609,4.3134,1.4327,3.5293,2.4721,4.5526,2.0528,1.3099,0.6096,2.4829,0.0017,1.5171,1.7103,3.9643,1.8567,5.111,1.4735,3.6185,5.1488,1.7896,0.0431,0.1223,2.5646,3.4622,1.2835,3.8261,0.3032,3.3367,2.9661,1.043,4.1202,0.2313,0.327,4.8815,4.9793,7.5056,3.7044,1.8439,4.1134,0.0178,1.7763,2.3171,0.8964,1.8037,0.9228,0.4103,1.2735,1.6415,1.0081,4.0502,0.1959,0.3171,1.4337,5.0927,0.7214,5.1837,2.2707,3.6391,2.0771,0.699,5.4302,0.8383,0.9515,3.9588,2.2968,1.3166,4.2541,0.7892,3.1421,2.8506,0.2212,1.4252,1.7959,1.6645,3.851,2.5721,5.3144,4.7875,2.1648,0.4195,6.797,5.6308,1.4251,0.3628,4.6329,1.019,1.1334,0.0033,3.8278,3.7345,4.4805,2.8664,1.9394,1.7696,5.3273,0.0135,0.0018,4.3204,0.0318,2.5155,5.5006,2.7012,0.0023,0.2021,4.3045,4.173,2.4052,0.0007,3.4045,0.2374,1.4091,5.0415,0.5909,1.1505,0.3072,4.1748,0.049,0.8528,0.6631,2.663,2.7878,1.2192,2.1221,0.001,0.2481,1.5234,1.5805,5.6005,0.0283,5.8803,2.18,2.1624,6.1323,3.8235,2.9293,5.4591,1.694,4.6847,2.3387,2.1431,0.4703,2.1658,3.9315,0.2845,2.4083,1.2613,0.7001,1.9343,0.9937,1.4355,0.0437,0.2362,0.8401,6.1572,1.3875,0.645,0.7825,0.9923,4.3319,2.3055,1.8481,0.1599,3.3703,1.0397,1.1007,1.1534,3.5538,4.525,2.8657,3.4186,0.9558,0.2211,1.0342,0.2857,2.2414,3.869,0.9668,3.4993,2.069,1.1427,0.8542,4.3872,2.7738,0.0521,1.1212,2.3429,3.2229,1.5643,6.085,6.2833,1.5876,0.8665,5.0459,0.3406,1.9935,4.9959,0.7557,3.7541,2.1369,0.4157,0.2033,0.5925,3.985,3.2728,0.4535,0.6847,0.1813,1.9632,5.344,1.1749,1.3716,0.8638,0.8496,0.8943,2.9527,0.2804,0.5832,1.6466,2.1816,0.8915,3.5143,2.9486,1.7574,2.5529,4.8583,3.4023,1.2664,5.1862,5.4423,0.4316,0.0003,1.7006,1.881,0.1544,4.8654,0.5152,1.0841,1.2672,1.6676,0.4529,3.3882,4.2249,1.8548,0.3343,5.6941,0.2365,1.1696,1.2767,2.2828,1.1126,0.6763,0.3782,4.6351,4.7518,7.1497,4.9017,6.0801,2.89,3.6848,2.3475,1.8775,3.5521,0.2079,5.7622,1.4515,4.0583,1.9468,1.9578,1.9558,5.4751,0.0668,2.5601,0.6375,0.8716,1.5469,5.899,0.6883,0.0752,0.8224]}

There was controversy after the production when it was rumored that some of the dwarves went into hiding after seeing the film, despite being present in the production until the very last.\n\nOn opening night, the audience booed the stage manager when he asked them to leave, only to be quickly drowned out by the cheers from the audience and the Dwarfs themselves. The stage management apologized and gave his audience a refund, but the Dwarfs complained and returned to the theater the following week. Even today, the entire community is fiercely protective of them, so few people even know that people were ever booed.\n\nIf you are seeing a movie in New York City after this production opened, you are welcome to join us for the following shows:","token_len":564,"entropy":[8.0925,14.2342,1.7644,4.4715,3.2103,0.5549,9.4587,1.096,2.7548,0.4621,9.0387,0.0516,2.6984,0.3678,7.9431,5.4515,0.9886,0.6911,0.0024,0.5774,1.5086,4.467,1.0126,1.9619,0.1731,3.5894,0.282,0.0007,0.0001,0.6426,8.1129,6.5149,4.1013,6.2906,1.8834,1.6644,0.1691,0.0002,1.2779,0.7085,5.987,1.7419,5.1698,0.0074,1.3542,4.6963,2.7484,5.4962,0.2771,1.5571,3.2031,2.9036,3.1129,0.8302,1.7373,0.0816,2.6455,2.9425,2.0286,0.6101,5.3165,0.2389,2.5517,1.2051,0.0003,1.2845,2.8401,0.8086,2.0375,0.0055,11.4228,8.2733,1.091,0.329,0.0143,0.005,0.0113,0.1096,0.0128,9.4789,0.2621,0.0015,0.0028,0.0167,0.0321,0.0029,0.0012,0.0004,2.7235,0.1476,0.0016,0.0042,0.0032,0.0002,0.0032,0.0041,0.0,0.0011,0.0022,0.0007,0.0012,0.0003,0.0005,0.0022,0.0138,0.0017,0.0007,0.0009,0.0012,0.0005,0.0003,0.0009,0.0016,2.9468,0.0009,0.0004,0.0009,0.0022,0.0008,0.0011,0.0018,0.0001,0.0006,0.0131,0.0013,1.4292,3.146,1.3247,5.2184,0.0567,4.7919,0.0709,0.8084,0.0116,0.0246,1.2992,1.0003,1.5824,2.4594,1.2149,3.1711,3.4543,2.4695,0.0184,0.4119,1.6024,0.0181,2.5835,2.9762,0.0554,0.0018,0.2295,1.1381,0.0002,3.0329,0.3911,0.4029,3.915,1.1459,2.9617,0.0829,2.3807,0.2639,5.2808,0.446,0.6663,4.9768,3.5251,0.1072,2.5414,0.0006,2.8293,0.7,1.1608,5.327,1.1463,0.0161,0.8927,3.198,0.0235,2.5359,1.2336,5.7583,1.0566,0.8125,0.0003,0.0029,5.0502,4.6245,0.9497,4.8833,0.59,5.2827,0.2467,4.1375,3.2321,3.3996,5.4708,5.2017,0.0002,5.1228,0.9669,3.8316,4.0296,4.683,4.5745,2.7623,3.4535,2.016,1.2839,0.0017,5.3242,2.2119,2.4,0.961,2.4911,5.2602,0.327,0.1526,2.9926,7.1637,0.7605,0.7656,5.2171,4.7718,5.2349,0.9157,2.7788,1.358,1.3241,2.6166,2.5711,0.2575,0.0239,3.2157,1.4761,3.1824,4.161,1.0405,4.0976,4.2254,1.2849,2.689,2.8568,0.2817,0.0822,0.0047,0.0974,0.3908,0.0003,6.7123,5.9311,0.0809,0.1782,0.0002,0.0015,0.0005,0.0009,0.0014,0.0348,0.0004,0.0002,0.0014,0.0003,0.0002,0.0018,0.0006,0.0051,0.0001,0.002,0.0015,0.0139,0.0028,0.0015,0.0013,0.0011,0.0005,0.0019,0.0048,0.0004,0.003,0.0018,0.0018,0.0012,0.0002,0.0016,0.0005,0.0012,0.0007,0.0016,0.0012,0.0016,0.0054,0.0078,0.0067,0.0049,0.0032,0.0016,0.0029,0.0012,0.0011,0.0005,0.0008,0.0015,0.0015,0.0032,0.0012,0.001,0.0002,0.001,0.0008,0.0051,0.0008,0.0012,0.0007,0.0007,0.001,1.1721,0.8186,3.5078,0.9865,7.3113,5.3609,1.8885,3.7848,2.0392,4.7855,1.7623,2.6038,4.3382,0.0154,4.5292,1.8731,0.957,0.1055,2.0956,1.3353,0.4619,3.1583,0.0951,4.1433,2.7836,0.0038,0.0047,0.0,0.0355,6.274,4.0569,3.7011,0.7661,4.738,0.0112,4.4816,3.0978,1.4496,0.164,1.722,1.7303,1.6418,1.9889,4.5933,0.4369,0.0001,0.0001,1.9133,5.2737,3.9839,2.773,0.8607,0.0193,0.3594,0.6813,0.0604,0.126,1.9376,3.606,0.2479,0.5269,0.0002,2.1036,0.006,0.0013,0.0005,0.0006,0.1362,0.0023,0.0002,0.0005,0.0007,0.0005,0.002,0.0137,0.0006,0.1467,2.5558,0.0013,0.0006,0.0712,0.0001,0.0088,0.0,0.001,0.0009,0.0014,0.0015,0.0183,0.0007,0.0028,0.0012,0.0026,0.0005,0.001,0.0015,0.0009,4.716,1.2091,4.1906,3.7672,0.2552,0.7042,2.7222,1.5397,0.4565,4.7717,0.3999,3.2823,0.4474,0.0716,2.6844,5.5648,2.6506,1.3041,1.561,3.0726,0.8292,2.8914,1.5731,4.5981,2.2863,4.4503,1.3783,0.3929,1.5044,5.5727,0.4541,0.852,2.0904,3.3405,1.0308,0.0002,4.8761,3.7896,0.0387,0.138,1.1709,2.95,3.2554,0.0018,1.326,4.3236,1.9877,1.4833,0.3402,2.6803,1.2289,0.1542,2.2247,2.3051,5.5527,0.3208,0.8854,4.5136,3.176,0.0338,0.1334,1.0208,1.3581,2.5233,0.1088,0.4042,3.348,0.9572,4.2016,0.0404,1.3556,0.2373,2.28,1.9321,7.1315,3.0462,1.751,4.2075,4.8635,3.0379,0.9565,1.4132,1.6197,0.8543,1.2983,1.9321,0.0043,5.717,2.2435,5.4213,1.1272,0.5188,1.3465,1.3131,1.2929,1.7609,0.7177,6.9277,4.0896,0.1259,1.2613,5.5415,6.673,2.7825,4.5783,0.5933,0.0232,3.8948,1.3187,4.235,6.3764,1.0501,3.2772,0.7459,1.5921,6.4737,2.5094,3.9846,0.3502,1.0523,2.2945,0.25,0.0003,5.5274,0.3236,3.1973,5.5095,2.4037,2.8236,1.8134,1.4228,0.0041,0.4895,5.4524,1.5088,0.5489,3.9174,0.196,1.4233,2.1672,5.0705,0.0333,3.0891,1.0994,1.0354,1.5678,3.721,3.7671,0.5405]}

{"id":1271,"ended":true,"length":523,"gen_text":"In the United States, fire and hot liquids are the most common causes of burns. Of house fires that result in death, smoking causes 25 % and heating devices cause 22 %.\n\nIt was in the year 1810 that Sir David Brewster introduced the first modern water pipe with improved material and construction. Its main advantage has been that the water in the pipe does not enter your lungs but reaches your esophagus where it is absorbed by your liver before it reaches and is absorbed by your stomach. This is a very good health feature because it reduces the intake of alcohol, but also the risk of infections, stomach disorders, heart attacks and death (for people who drink heavily).\n\nAlthough a water pipe can be used for relaxing as well, with a filter the water will be free from carcinogenic substances.\n\nHealth hazard\n\nDrinking water in the same glass as tobacco makes it easier for people to smoke, but it also makes your mouth and throat and lungs warmer than they would be, so there is a risk of developing lung cancer.\n\nHowever, some of the water pipe users also use them to smoke pot.\n\nHealth effects and risks\n\nBreathing in water through a water pipe is more dangerous than breathing from your mouth. If you do not use filters the water might even contain dangerous substances, like arsenic which is found in the water.\n\nThe water is also sometimes contaminated with bacteria, which means the water might provide an infection.\n\nEven though there is no evidence that a water pipe causes cancer, that does not mean that it is harmless. It will affect the health of your lungs, digestive systems and immune system.\n\nIt is not necessary to have a filter in the water pipe, but you should still be aware of this issue.\n\nHow to protect yourself\n\nThe most important thing to keep in mind when using a water pipe is:\n\nIf you are young, avoid using water pipes at all, because you will not develop proper habits during this time.\n\nIf you are aged or have developed bad habits, you will certainly have a problem using a water pipe. If you use it daily or drink from it more than 2 litres per day, you should consider using a water filter with a high pH.\n\nWhen you smoke, you should reduce your intake of marijuana. If you regularly do this, your lungs should be strengthened and you should not have any problems with your lungs using a water pipe.\n\nIn some parts of the world, like in Mexico and the United States, you are not allowed to use a water pipe in public places.\n\nIf you are in a country where it is forbidden, you should be careful with how you use it and have a filter included with the water pipe.","token_len":564,"entropy":[1.7422,4.574,0.0745,0.2171,9.1875,3.4716,8.5027,4.5061,0.9337,2.149,1.0931,0.5968,1.0284,0.0611,3.1657,0.7807,5.8108,10.1725,0.0343,2.5229,2.4021,0.0608,2.8447,0.2478,8.6517,2.6826,6.3578,7.1869,1.6919,4.0138,4.2708,2.4569,3.8121,0.2086,0.6469,1.7618,0.0018,4.9119,3.9563,3.1124,1.3517,3.307,2.097,4.2954,0.3324,4.652,5.3543,0.0651,0.0027,4.2349,0.3663,0.9377,3.5441,3.6992,3.4381,4.2037,7.3828,5.5596,0.8088,2.3895,0.5712,5.828,3.3466,1.4485,5.5592,0.4324,1.5277,1.8961,1.3789,4.4751,0.4879,0.3926,1.9703,0.006,3.9547,4.1569,0.3755,3.2999,5.1922,0.5564,3.7865,0.0002,0.0011,3.3802,0.2795,0.4974,1.6429,1.6077,1.4438,4.4116,4.5651,1.0634,1.394,6.7084,2.074,1.8807,0.3158,0.2379,0.3397,0.2587,2.0124,1.8166,1.8081,1.6888,2.8822,4.3023,3.6044,2.2209,0.9022,2.712,0.2873,4.1532,0.0158,2.8788,1.8034,4.994,2.4688,3.2255,1.3842,0.0456,4.9442,2.6119,4.033,3.0773,0.8155,2.8319,2.2307,0.6472,4.6494,4.8391,4.9908,4.3814,0.6931,2.0654,3.0515,0.3234,0.7164,0.0002,4.9255,3.8914,1.376,0.0984,2.7454,0.5899,0.8669,1.4954,5.8446,2.9907,0.1314,2.4275,5.965,2.132,4.7296,3.3303,2.0669,2.6341,1.2893,4.4203,0.8756,5.5564,0.9035,1.2786,1.0241,1.5584,0.0002,5.6325,6.0918,1.0844,0.0002,4.6253,0.0994,0.9161,2.3441,1.6856,3.5943,1.4469,0.4742,0.9223,5.1439,1.218,2.9558,0.6348,2.4639,0.1887,1.9287,2.4375,2.622,1.6263,1.12,2.121,4.7478,2.8502,1.3829,0.249,4.4879,1.0724,5.99,2.131,1.7794,1.5406,0.3514,5.3447,2.0128,3.6252,0.2749,0.472,1.0673,0.1842,1.9846,2.1464,0.2804,0.4255,0.9137,0.0002,4.5113,0.0754,3.8567,3.5865,0.0647,2.8153,1.6896,3.19,3.2329,1.9831,2.9343,0.9514,0.9076,4.3853,1.1359,1.5368,0.0002,4.27,3.8019,4.0093,1.5392,0.4102,0.0002,5.2606,0.4393,0.0173,1.1116,2.2401,3.1432,0.4507,0.2111,0.0515,1.3996,2.8523,1.3945,0.1888,1.2881,2.9753,4.2624,0.3116,1.0812,3.6423,0.3918,2.8409,0.8021,1.8529,2.9285,3.6907,0.585,4.46,5.0673,2.3662,3.6459,2.4761,2.1982,2.0624,1.77,4.2592,1.0986,3.2653,0.091,2.6173,2.2143,1.6804,0.7291,0.0002,2.1488,1.9175,3.1583,1.7897,5.7478,1.1748,0.4755,1.4593,1.5164,1.6188,3.616,2.958,1.0395,1.9571,6.4798,2.0384,2.5365,2.1064,0.7696,0.0002,4.5659,1.5789,2.6161,0.8815,0.9739,1.628,0.5282,3.1682,0.3229,0.0453,1.2415,0.3653,0.1669,6.2286,0.6211,0.0045,0.0922,0.6136,0.6808,0.4265,2.1811,0.2595,2.4845,4.6481,3.9416,1.6496,1.5853,0.0862,1.2507,0.7457,1.4545,4.9795,4.7065,0.5086,3.4344,0.1266,0.5037,0.5667,0.0002,3.0805,0.6288,2.1269,4.2572,0.1203,2.9627,0.5454,0.8305,1.431,1.6897,0.2318,0.252,1.4877,0.7655,2.5311,0.5301,4.0061,2.8327,1.0646,0.2252,3.4137,3.9871,0.4607,0.4583,0.0002,3.0036,0.5149,2.72,0.2602,0.4896,0.0002,2.3627,2.3897,0.2868,0.2957,0.9952,3.0729,0.1013,0.0041,1.4677,0.3441,0.2384,0.016,0.0186,0.0642,3.8891,0.2072,0.0002,4.2261,0.3518,1.2299,3.751,0.7796,4.1372,0.8592,1.2865,0.1526,3.2388,0.5217,2.9429,2.4748,1.8,1.6539,1.6391,3.3809,4.5479,3.5683,7.0078,1.9234,0.9275,0.2521,0.2612,0.0002,1.4713,0.0404,0.2404,5.242,3.0997,0.906,5.0771,4.1486,0.051,0.4566,1.7115,2.9608,5.4504,2.2658,0.8624,2.6243,2.8936,0.6502,0.0177,0.0069,0.4807,3.5407,0.1742,2.7941,2.2809,3.9528,2.5622,5.657,3.1816,0.2132,3.6102,0.3017,3.5845,1.5952,1.6172,0.0529,0.2492,0.6892,0.7235,1.9778,2.2833,0.3976,0.9434,0.7715,4.0952,1.2593,3.4104,5.0362,1.7626,0.3943,0.0002,3.7239,1.0302,2.5318,1.0633,1.4627,1.1657,4.2909,1.1387,0.6348,0.3363,6.8092,1.541,2.2815,0.1114,4.9604,4.9614,0.6533,0.2407,2.1729,0.67,3.5375,1.0834,6.3816,1.1035,1.2492,0.85,1.5876,1.293,1.437,0.6472,0.9007,1.493,0.5627,5.4691,0.254,0.0189,0.0246,0.0962,0.284,0.0002,3.8676,3.6015,3.9253,0.0068,0.1596,0.091,0.3395,3.984,1.382,3.3422,1.5121,2.0517,0.9156,0.0603,0.0946,2.5906,2.9454,1.2763,0.2152,0.0117,0.9158,0.6425,0.0197,0.035,2.9203,0.2316,1.0295,0.7175,1.4038,0.0002,1.9219,0.0986,1.2265,2.1484,1.2669,2.3936,0.3546,1.8746,0.0248,2.8536,1.0868,1.0377,0.3802,2.7699,1.3772,2.4017,2.7288,0.8398,0.406,1.3447,1.9621,4.8972,0.5886,0.7228,7.1314,2.0454,1.7309,0.4176,0.1675,0.1623]}
{"id":1098,"ended":true,"length":514,"gen_text":"According to an article by the Daily Mail, the number of stay @ - @ at @ - @ home dads in 2007 had increased by 83 percent since 1993. According to the article, over one in 10 fathers now stays at home on a child's birth day; around half of these men are from working middle class backgrounds.\n\nWhile the majority are educated, men who don't belong into higher socio-economic class tend to be less likely to have access to good and reliable childcare during child birth. This is a result of economic and political issues, according to the article.\n\nThis social issue plays into the fact that it's considered shameful for many men who don't work. Women have a better option but for those who are less well off with less education the options available to them may be more limited.\n\nWomen tend to be more educated while men tend to have a poorer household income with little prospect of earning more. There are also concerns parents don't have the financial security they need to deal with early child care costs.\n\nWhat's also known as'stay-at-home dads' have become more publicised in recent months, with their issues having been reflected in articles in publications like the Mail, Daily Mail, Metro and Huffington Post.\n\nMany of these studies focus on the importance of the father's role in the lives of their children, with many citing the benefits these dads have brought to their children, often through their relationship with their children.\n\nHowever, this focus of researchers on fathers makes it very unlikely a survey that included stay-at-home dads that actually included child care would find many different results.\n\nIt would be an accurate study that included both fathers, mothers and non-resident fathers, but what would it find? It would also be an accurate study that didn't include any men in the study who didn't have access to a nursery or childcare, where any benefits are being experienced.\n\nThese facts led many commentators to warn the research was biased. Professor Tim Besley from the University of Manchester said the article was 'incorrect, if you know what I mean.'\n\nBut others had their own concerns over the use of un-analysed data from three interviews and the absence of any form of control.\n\nThis research, while important, is not the one that will convince us that stay-at-home dads have a real disadvantage and can be helped.\n\nWe need to learn more about the importance of fathers, both working and not-well employed. We also need to examine how this is perceived by men themselves, not just women.\n\nWe also need to work on how we can create support for good, professional childcare for more parents to ensure our families have the right balance of women and men.","token_len":565,"entropy":[0.0086,3.915,2.2776,1.9638,2.0046,3.2987,0.8095,0.2832,1.524,5.9104,0.0772,10.1149,13.2009,8.276,10.6273,6.3809,6.1566,3.7856,0.2393,4.5717,10.9613,1.8987,8.5564,4.6998,1.5574,1.0945,5.8404,2.2461,2.0239,3.7953,0.6119,4.4208,0.0071,0.7207,1.6769,0.181,5.2391,4.0167,1.6135,2.9114,2.2244,2.3364,3.9029,0.4648,0.1388,5.0524,1.3452,5.836,0.1794,1.1497,1.041,5.4095,5.6129,2.8515,0.3151,1.4027,2.8129,1.0163,3.1894,3.8911,5.491,0.4426,0.5996,0.2845,0.6414,0.0035,3.7993,1.3671,3.4483,4.1795,5.5181,1.046,3.9388,2.3966,3.2773,0.0019,6.3238,6.7628,3.8394,2.6959,0.0747,0.0097,2.9603,2.4724,0.0422,1.6422,2.3304,1.4034,0.0266,2.6796,3.101,0.012,3.8708,4.8481,3.4218,0.2622,5.9259,4.5111,1.6096,0.4621,2.8351,1.1125,2.6503,3.3454,0.0568,4.4583,2.2417,4.296,2.9639,1.8933,3.4965,0.0094,0.8147,0.6238,0.3165,0.4988,0.0002,4.1664,5.7859,1.6385,6.2374,2.8069,0.5789,3.5911,0.0471,4.371,1.4514,5.2891,3.8881,1.0549,4.2226,1.4767,3.9384,1.4089,0.0005,1.7835,2.8874,4.7846,3.0968,2.5663,4.0118,3.9488,5.5229,4.0889,2.4819,0.7,2.0596,4.3481,2.5187,0.289,7.0171,1.8683,1.4581,3.854,2.1046,4.2088,1.0463,0.0976,3.1898,0.6887,2.6286,0.1148,0.2301,0.3685,0.0002,4.8705,4.0511,0.0135,1.7219,1.234,2.2448,4.5988,0.2617,1.0178,0.0156,2.0254,1.8982,4.2364,5.1579,0.303,5.1458,4.3118,3.2683,0.1791,3.2998,1.2312,0.8774,4.623,0.9469,1.5412,4.6361,7.525,3.3146,0.0004,1.5159,0.9647,2.8293,3.7109,3.0592,0.685,0.6821,5.0436,0.0082,5.6912,2.2248,1.5676,2.1245,0.546,0.2599,0.0002,4.4227,1.9156,3.9284,5.7857,0.426,10.5041,7.2802,4.1165,2.175,2.2121,0.0272,0.0149,0.9768,0.2695,2.5923,2.3164,1.5059,6.1625,1.5477,0.9244,0.3814,3.8383,1.7761,1.1343,4.923,5.201,4.2509,0.6045,5.6896,0.3094,4.0639,1.6993,3.2753,1.7207,0.8259,3.3894,1.5436,3.1791,0.4732,0.6791,3.1412,1.0009,3.9239,0.0156,0.1591,0.2977,0.0002,4.4971,1.3946,0.8127,6.0389,4.1289,0.0607,1.0128,4.869,0.1132,3.1281,1.8283,1.4544,1.1155,0.4219,1.0415,3.2712,0.018,1.2761,0.1493,1.1195,2.3645,2.4235,3.6043,1.0319,3.1735,5.0293,1.7694,1.3343,5.1059,0.2583,0.597,0.512,2.4223,4.3261,2.6041,1.7361,5.8159,0.2378,0.8844,0.5174,0.5215,0.2974,0.0002,2.5133,0.2091,3.3326,4.5151,4.9803,6.1227,1.4421,1.8496,6.0168,0.7667,4.2641,5.868,4.4276,4.1599,4.1658,5.2782,2.0879,1.2799,0.0414,0.007,0.0062,0.2283,6.96,5.1714,1.9521,5.2386,0.8233,2.6094,1.7425,3.6844,3.9899,1.2515,0.3861,0.4696,0.0002,3.378,2.8013,0.9207,4.3697,4.1588,2.4023,2.617,1.6231,1.9509,2.6861,4.354,2.986,0.2769,2.0792,0.0365,3.4119,0.551,1.2111,1.0088,4.9663,2.3553,1.904,1.116,0.1683,3.6381,0.722,2.772,1.475,1.1217,0.2841,0.3951,0.7156,3.074,0.0006,1.6926,2.649,3.2923,3.4233,1.3587,3.2536,0.9256,1.6567,0.0003,1.585,0.8594,0.0077,2.6309,4.6098,1.6283,2.4956,2.816,5.7703,5.0987,3.3667,3.8122,4.0206,3.1755,0.4844,0.2005,0.0002,4.4133,4.5868,6.1335,3.7303,3.1097,0.2168,6.158,2.3401,2.6788,1.5673,2.5345,1.7421,5.0617,4.5988,3.4091,0.0103,2.145,0.5267,0.5188,0.0112,3.1703,1.7034,1.6325,3.3304,1.0106,1.955,4.424,0.8754,2.8126,4.2627,4.0473,4.4159,0.6644,1.559,0.0117,1.8571,0.2965,0.0002,3.9401,2.9511,4.8962,3.0117,0.863,1.6409,2.955,0.3168,5.1325,0.0087,5.3528,3.1293,4.2481,0.1605,0.5826,2.5774,6.0752,5.8948,2.9589,2.1443,4.6187,0.0062,2.0178,4.7762,0.008,1.5034,2.2563,0.3831,0.0002,4.2578,2.9906,3.4336,2.6272,3.5016,0.3318,1.286,1.449,1.7777,5.355,1.0037,1.0529,4.9168,2.9324,1.3211,0.8309,0.3538,0.0088,0.0053,0.0041,0.1198,2.8621,1.164,5.0155,6.0441,2.9169,3.6235,1.3082,2.8048,0.665,0.8379,0.0002,3.3147,1.1766,0.999,4.6833,0.4222,0.1947,0.885,5.3563,0.1756,1.2986,2.5561,3.7188,3.824,0.0733,1.2721,2.3281,9.1149,6.4016,1.815,1.0652,1.7873,0.0287,0.1385,4.5699,2.2041,3.8233,3.0498,4.8248,1.1755,2.133,2.8638,1.4236,3.6263,0.4122,3.242,0.3644,0.4655,0.0002,2.394,1.3954,0.0352,0.1015,4.1916,1.643,2.8173,1.2754,1.185,2.9468,4.6083,1.2016,6.1672,2.1148,5.5209,0.9488,1.8854,5.2744,2.9468,4.5991,2.2574,4.1094,4.2699,1.909,0.8334,3.787,1.9311,1.0083,5.1839,0.2696,0.0362,0.557]}
{"id":4320,"ended":false,"length":478,"gen_text":"Black mambas breed annually and mating occurs in the early spring, when male mambas locate a female by following her scent trail. After finding a potential mate the male will inspect the female's abdomen and will attempt to mate by placing his tongue on the female's front, hind-quarters or lower half. If the mating takes place successfully the male will deposit a single egg at the proper time of the year using an elongated web using his enlarged proboscis. The egg is then incubated during the following three months, and the female releases four fertile young at a time. The female has a lifespan of approximately five years, being weaned after 4-6 years of age. Mambas can breed with up to 9 different species of spider, but only with one species the mamba. If you have a larger spider than the mamba listed below, please contact us, so we can add it to this list!\n\nCommon names: Bambi, Bubalochlaena, Bambini, Bambu, Bambu Ape, Bambou, Bambye, Black Mamba, Bambou Ape.\n\nPhotographer: Richard James - Copyright \u00a9 2008. All rights reserved.\n\n\nOther Names: Black Mamba.\n\nSize: adult female varies from 5 -15cm, male 5 - 10cm long.\n\nRange: Found across much of Africa, but mainly in south western and central Africa and Madagascar.\n\n\nFood: They feed on other spiders (particularly wolf spiders), and can live as long as 20 years. The females will occasionally consume small vertebrates.\n\n\nHabitat: It has very low resistance to predation, and is often found under stones, stumps, and in hollow logs.\n\n\nReproduction: One female can produce between 6 - 12 eggs in a season, each of which is incubated in her abdomen. The young will be weaned after about 3-4 weeks after hatching.\n\n\nEgg laying: Once the female has released the eggs, the female will begin walking around for a period of several days. She will then return to the egg-laying chamber. Two to three weeks later the female eggs will hatch.\n\n\nConservation: In the area of Africa where the mamba occurs, it is considered a vulnerable species.\n\n\nWarning: If you own a wild living Bambi, the venom is relatively harmless but can be fatal if injected into the body of a human. If you are going to kill, capture, or keep some of these creatures for this reason then be sure that the premises you are keeping them in is sufficiently isolated that you are not going to contaminate the area with venom.\n\n\nYou Might Be Interested:","token_len":565,"entropy":[9.0794,3.954,0.0288,7.3343,7.3488,1.9941,6.6129,1.7689,1.2949,1.597,3.2604,0.4075,1.9897,2.3565,4.3937,1.0967,0.015,0.0032,6.9866,2.7175,1.0068,2.2852,4.1932,0.8961,0.5228,1.9302,0.6091,3.3943,5.2517,1.8539,3.1362,0.1287,4.8261,0.4935,2.1957,6.8739,0.8412,0.3639,1.1895,3.1659,1.23,3.1397,1.8338,0.046,1.2122,2.182,4.2573,0.3025,2.3958,1.6684,0.477,0.842,0.0971,6.125,3.6195,3.4049,5.1245,2.882,2.012,4.7401,4.75,0.6581,2.2367,0.7723,4.1423,2.564,0.0016,0.369,0.9118,0.5304,0.4132,2.1279,1.372,1.7851,1.408,3.9137,0.1572,6.646,0.801,2.0527,0.7357,0.224,6.1671,4.4508,2.9617,0.124,4.9715,6.7512,1.4204,4.3121,5.4245,0.0021,0.0044,0.4242,1.0246,1.759,1.0341,2.3244,2.608,0.0008,5.8751,0.2087,2.5672,2.8682,1.1578,2.0462,2.2946,1.2516,1.7431,4.8335,5.7922,5.131,1.2645,3.3793,1.3292,0.2589,0.9996,1.3989,2.1743,3.8852,0.991,2.7916,0.0368,2.4316,3.153,0.1875,1.6812,7.2382,4.3345,0.003,2.7409,4.1584,1.3226,1.2959,0.3922,1.0064,0.1309,0.3472,3.1331,0.529,0.0111,2.6273,4.1402,3.0069,2.233,0.0025,5.1935,2.4178,0.8673,0.3445,2.9303,1.2122,2.1356,2.446,1.5959,2.869,0.3946,6.1892,2.964,1.4828,2.9646,4.6284,2.0843,1.9292,1.4929,6.2435,0.9964,3.1923,0.949,0.7969,0.0935,5.0178,1.4517,0.6785,1.7617,1.2444,0.7213,3.5252,2.3241,0.4493,0.1431,2.3083,0.6721,0.1795,2.3949,0.4483,2.8468,1.0024,0.0057,4.5344,2.522,0.9589,4.7788,3.414,0.6827,0.4379,5.9025,5.1067,5.0102,0.8744,0.079,0.9954,2.3118,0.413,4.5594,0.1824,1.2998,0.1147,4.1298,0.3926,0.912,0.177,2.007,5.7804,1.8175,0.1366,0.8159,0.1149,3.744,0.2896,5.7213,10.015,0.3204,5.5231,2.351,0.0937,0.2318,1.4697,0.3694,1.4824,2.4871,0.0074,4.2164,0.368,0.0002,5.0146,0.4777,0.1205,5.0294,5.64,5.4794,5.3522,1.8801,3.4526,1.9423,0.6947,0.3361,0.0077,0.1014,2.8775,0.0003,4.2366,2.3948,0.1223,2.5524,1.2328,0.1536,3.3912,0.6467,0.0001,3.1618,0.0468,5.9624,1.5024,5.7669,0.5474,2.8273,2.7771,5.6733,2.4482,2.1847,1.7834,2.0246,0.2972,3.3548,0.2202,3.6008,0.3827,0.1976,0.0001,3.5511,0.02,4.0945,3.449,2.55,0.002,1.0684,0.91,2.7755,3.5615,0.2611,3.3819,4.1666,0.6675,0.5292,0.1179,3.5051,2.8968,0.2298,3.02,0.0002,2.6625,0.1145,3.4398,2.0345,0.3975,4.5652,0.9616,2.8671,2.6059,3.9986,0.0491,1.2382,2.6508,4.4476,4.6786,4.8819,0.0863,0.0193,2.2437,0.0626,0.6378,3.8344,3.0741,2.2898,4.306,3.5891,2.4056,1.897,0.1232,1.574,1.1586,0.0002,0.6794,0.0094,0.0027,0.0514,4.8626,3.3055,5.5667,3.7965,5.3779,0.0429,2.8647,0.0027,1.0137,0.9583,1.2593,1.9823,0.2285,2.9847,2.0893,0.7882,3.9732,0.2283,0.6931,2.46,2.5609,3.4272,0.8513,0.5042,1.1164,0.0002,3.3348,0.0006,0.0143,0.0569,6.0942,1.7436,2.4535,0.651,2.9871,2.9805,1.226,2.1681,1.924,2.4916,1.1358,2.158,1.1036,4.0007,2.5361,0.0286,1.673,1.7758,0.0043,3.6224,2.0908,1.9514,2.0944,0.8469,2.4198,2.7699,1.7773,2.4786,0.0008,0.4956,2.2516,2.258,1.3039,0.4438,2.1644,4.192,0.6943,0.0,0.5111,1.2667,0.0002,4.5295,0.216,4.0048,0.3371,4.6869,0.7569,0.8348,0.7686,4.7262,1.223,0.3263,0.6609,2.477,2.2796,0.6294,4.1156,3.9972,0.9514,3.5812,1.2496,1.7089,0.0881,2.6549,0.63,1.3313,1.3935,0.3594,1.3857,2.6703,0.0563,0.9433,2.5956,1.4404,0.0544,0.0001,2.9633,2.0457,6.4166,1.6248,0.931,1.8312,0.3817,1.2388,0.4324,8.5235,0.075,0.6017,1.0837,1.5248,0.0002,5.3649,0.0211,0.4129,4.5375,1.5549,6.5498,1.8909,3.4372,0.4668,1.5072,0.9449,0.1535,2.1132,0.3726,1.0306,0.213,1.6363,1.9723,1.7672,0.1026,0.7481,1.6639,0.0002,5.0819,0.099,3.0647,0.463,5.5398,0.6001,5.1228,6.097,1.8259,0.0888,0.6261,0.4737,4.6593,4.28,1.3888,6.1802,1.5065,3.8903,1.8141,1.2718,1.1741,0.8362,3.0058,0.9256,0.6161,1.7421,0.3954,0.7857,1.0,0.5534,2.6996,0.6179,1.48,4.08,0.0894,3.8496,5.2562,1.7148,1.1261,0.3682,3.5377,7.3107,1.4806,0.4924,2.5661,2.1715,5.869,0.7927,2.8857,2.5406,0.8252,2.1199,2.5459,5.5868,1.4417,0.8236,1.4296,0.4191,0.1238,1.4595,3.9874,3.6073,4.1203,1.5962,1.546,0.9052,3.2692,0.0306,5.6602,0.0003,0.9961,2.2534,0.6228,1.6651,0.5139,1.2799,0.0002,5.2891,7.4838,3.6638,0.066,0.0001,1.1487]}
{"id":3594,"ended":false,"length":503,"gen_text":"Within days, Simpson was heading east again, taking a flying boat to Batavia, where he joined the advance party of the I Corps, which was being sent from the Middle East.\n\nIt was in the Middle East that Simpson worked closely with other Army men like Lieutenant George N. Ritter, who also fought across the desert in the same brigade as him, and a medic named George S. Gillett.\n\nOn his third trip across the desert, and when the war had turned for the worse, Simpson and he were still waiting for the American forces to arrive, when the Germans finally surrendered to him. The men of the 6th Infantry Division who were with the US 3rd Armored Division on the southern end of the Euphrates, would be held up on their road to Mersa Matruh. As a result, the battle was a disaster for both sides, as the 6th Division suffered losses of 5,500 during the fighting, while the Americans suffered only 250 wounded. It was there that the men of the 6th Division who would go on to form the infantry division of the 82nd Airborne Division would meet the Iraqi Army and Kurds who would become part of the new Iraqi military of the country.\n\nAftermath:\n\nAfter the war, Simpson was decorated for combat and kept his rank, making him the most decorated American soldier alive. He had served with the U.S. 6th Infantry Division, 6th Armored Cavalry Regiment, and 6th Infantry Division. He spent a year in combat, and at the end of the war became an aide to General George S. Patton's command at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. During the first months after the war ended, Simpson left North Carolina for his permanent home in California, and died there in 1980. After Simpson's death, his family in Texas filed a claim for damages for what he endured during the war. The family settled for a small amount of money under the condition that the government will not seek recompense from the government. There is little mention in the historical record of Simpson, as he was written out of history. However, today, over twenty years after the events of Desert Storm, Simpson's name remains on numerous military records, especially in Iraq. On June 7, 2000, the U.S. Treasury Department honored Simpson with its second-highest military awards, the Distinguished Flying Cross for \"his outstanding courage and extraordinary valor in Korea \", and the Purple Heart for wounds suffered during the war in Vietnam.\n\nFor more about the story, read this article in the National Enquirer.\n\n\nSources:\n\nNARA.

{"id":1305,"ended":false,"length":504,"gen_text":"East Carolina won the pre @ - @ game coin toss and deferred the ball until the second half, allowing Boise State to receive the ball to begin the game. The Broncos received the ball and drove deep in the Blue Hose red zone only to be stopped by a pass interference. In the next play K.J. Hill threw a pass short to R.O. Boesser, but Boise State defense intercepted Boesser and returned it for a touchdown after which the game was knotted up at 7, Boise lead 7-0 at the half. Boise then led by 6 at the half. In the final drive of the first half the Blue Hose had the ball first, but the Broncos moved the ball for only 13 yards into the Red Zone, before the Broncos had to punt for the second time of the game. On the first play of the second half Boise returned the pick 6 yards with little less than a minute left, but the Broncos could not score and led 7-7 late in the half.\n\nBoth teams faced the possibility of a second half tie, during the second half. Late in the second half the Blue Hose had the ball on the Ohio State - Boise State 20 yard line, but Boise had the ball for only 3 minutes and 45 seconds. After a sack the Broncos faced a 2-yard line, with which the two teams exchanged punts. In the next play the Broncos had their first sack of the game, this time on Boesser. On the second down Boesser got two yards into the Buckeye red zone, where he was unable to gain even one yard. By the end of the next offensive series Ohio State led 21-7. The last series went as follows. Boise had 10 minutes on the clock, but they could only drive 5 yards at a time, the first 5 yards being a drop by quarterback Dennis McPherson.

The town became less politically active after its incorporation in 638. The Prophet's first visit to Jifna took place in 669 when he stayed at the house of Abu al Hasan '- a leader of the Quraysh family, but other visits took place during the first three decades of Islam.\nNabiyya was established as a Muslim state, and the Prophet's first visit to Nabuwwa took place in 669 when he visited Nabiyyah along with other leaders from various ethnic groups who were present at the Battle of Khandaq between Muhammad and Nabuwwa, with the majority of the Qurayshis ruling over the Quraysh. As a Muslim state, Nabiyya has no capital, nor any large city but it is relatively large. The capital is the largest, and the largest Christian church in the world, the Holy Cross in Bordeaux, is situated in Nabiyyah.\nJerusalem is the capital of the Palestinian state, and is the third most populous city in all of Palestine.

It has no capital. The country is primarily divided as West Bank and Israel. The West Bank, known as Judea, is predominantly Jewish, and the majority of its population is Sephardic, and only a small percentage is Palestinian. The West Bank was originally comprised of the Kingdom of Jordan, and then a British Mandate in the 1940s. Following the 1948 Israeli War of Independence (as part of the larger Palestinian Arab-Israeli War of 1948-67 ), the West Bank was divided between two Jewish states, Israel and Jordan. In 1967, when Israel declared sovereignty over the West Bank, the Jordanians declared independence.\nEast Palestine \/ \"east Palestine \" is a territorial entity administered by the United Nations as a state, and its capital is Ramallah. The name East Palestine comes from a village in east Palestine in 19 AH, just prior to the birth of Jesus. The area became a part of Palestine just a few years later. It is known for its high rate of poverty, and extreme poverty. Poverty is exacerbated by land confiscations, and by the government's policies towards the people of the area. Many of the major cities are located in the East, such as Ramallah and East Jerusalem.\nOther sources :","token_len":566,"entropy":[8.11,11.0233,2.0636,6.8257,0.025,5.881,0.4095,8.2437,0.5648,0.9741,2.3068,0.7879,0.9792,8.9465,0.1435,0.012,0.043,0.0179,4.1376,2.8242,0.501,1.1139,0.3716,16.8853,7.5078,11.0993,5.3761,2.585,0.042,5.0827,0.7378,1.4274,0.0043,7.2384,1.1765,1.3097,0.1651,1.4564,0.6219,1.593,0.9525,1.748,4.5077,3.3961,9.8145,6.4203,2.8696,1.4292,3.1934,2.6342,3.0608,2.2478,3.0144,1.5055,2.0329,5.8385,1.596,4.3863,1.6249,0.088,1.8185,0.0741,0.0366,2.6593,0.0026,0.4007,0.4453,5.547,2.6822,0.2222,2.8935,1.549,0.7613,1.6654,0.0216,2.3759,2.778,6.0444,4.9226,6.6828,4.6069,4.3959,0.2996,0.2959,4.1643,0.0966,0.0532,3.6299,2.3587,4.7218,5.7297,1.2641,2.0894,0.0049,3.2253,0.9227,3.4091,2.0221,1.3396,0.1294,1.3123,0.388,1.9451,8.3252,2.9482,2.7267,0.7177,2.0151,4.1384,1.7455,0.4139,4.0977,3.0623,3.7961,2.4045,2.0886,1.5701,1.3588,1.5299,0.6437,0.3691,1.0266,6.5631,1.0347,1.0362,0.5217,0.0011,0.1926,0.3764,2.7776,1.3427,0.1299,3.5842,5.9568,1.1371,3.6968,4.8551,0.0397,2.6751,2.9512,3.0996,4.6302,5.4799,0.9659,3.7711,1.4528,3.7766,1.3312,0.1521,2.5303,0.007,4.3605,1.4497,0.0076,5.68,4.6009,0.3537,5.4556,0.4833,0.018,0.0449,3.4614,4.681,0.84,4.1683,0.1958,0.6851,0.7387,0.0142,6.915,4.9365,2.8125,0.653,3.2909,0.0445,0.1322,1.327,5.0951,1.2981,2.6468,0.2743,0.2396,0.3261,0.5282,0.1822,5.1043,4.0131,2.9308,1.3212,4.3584,1.5117,5.5626,3.0684,4.3952,2.0409,1.1962,5.5862,1.7672,1.7096,1.7795,3.23,0.948,1.9919,4.7621,4.8873,2.0228,1.5562,1.6435,5.0294,2.5148,0.8338,0.3933,0.479,1.5738,0.7219,3.8771,2.282,1.7057,5.1878,2.1147,0.0019,0.4816,1.1247,2.4446,0.8001,1.044,0.169,1.5423,0.327,1.1855,5.1087,0.0972,2.0788,0.9621,1.4987,0.1144,0.3814,2.764,0.8569,1.2676,0.8506,2.3329,1.0841,3.3189,2.3712,0.7833,0.118,0.2195,3.5181,0.0411,0.5222,0.7726,4.2741,0.4562,0.8114,0.1709,0.1437,0.2753,1.6247,1.7515,2.4099,2.2826,3.4251,2.1656,1.9663,1.578,1.3056,4.8369,1.1683,0.3262,0.4686,1.0925,5.0292,1.0643,2.6288,4.9981,0.0736,0.4999,5.8861,1.6229,2.1984,0.6244,1.4341,3.4591,1.0637,0.7801,1.7482,1.0453,0.0138,0.2977,1.5253,3.2546,0.0252,4.6188,0.9303,0.0008,7.8304,4.6119,5.6969,1.0391,10.9552,1.7154,1.2574,0.0202,0.4208,1.0511,1.1367,2.8859,3.9603,0.1709,0.2828,1.3787,0.0465,2.0254,1.1401,4.466,1.6763,1.1857,2.8098,2.7036,1.4686,1.9638,1.4041,4.2449,1.1243,5.358,3.4118,6.9472,3.6604,0.0244,1.1608,4.8433,1.1437,1.2139,1.1878,0.02,2.9056,3.9343,0.2808,3.2481,0.0024,1.7247,2.3024,4.4329,1.3687,0.9989,1.0314,1.5257,2.6936,0.0571,1.6184,1.0682,0.5417,5.5685,0.0118,0.0962,1.9411,2.9038,4.9707,1.5934,0.7788,1.4172,0.9725,1.5165,0.2093,0.8961,2.4446,0.0087,2.5439,3.563,5.3229,0.0431,1.3675,2.6489,0.0038,0.7712,0.8395,1.5406,3.1612,4.438,2.83,1.158,0.0022,3.0571,1.934,2.5286,0.2752,0.663,3.9709,0.2789,1.5368,2.753,1.034,0.0614,0.0016,4.0031,4.761,4.0081,0.003,0.176,5.1058,3.51,1.6374,0.6269,0.0184,0.505,2.0043,1.0031,1.5895,3.5681,3.6843,0.6454,1.5201,0.0054,0.5626,1.5918,1.5335,3.1792,3.6942,0.6963,0.9036,1.5855,0.136,0.5412,0.5203,2.581,0.7578,0.1712,4.3771,0.6965,2.682,3.9124,0.288,0.2963,0.2751,0.0054,0.4666,1.0813,3.0294,0.1315,3.6913,1.6353,2.3048,2.3941,3.8714,6.2504,0.9718,0.111,2.6965,0.4308,1.9714,0.5317,0.7259,4.5572,2.0794,1.5794,0.0585,0.0757,0.2709,0.0128,0.1778,0.1049,0.0535,1.991,1.3464,4.5261,0.36,0.0897,1.4872,0.003,0.5956,1.1653,5.2987,1.9622,0.219,2.5661,0.0134,2.6344,4.5692,0.9417,6.2202,0.8157,3.4351,6.3255,3.4598,2.0336,5.5957,1.6783,0.0056,0.1096,2.7185,0.0106,1.4355,0.7548,1.1279,1.7018,4.0659,1.6921,1.2737,0.0022,2.7497,5.9758,2.8287,0.271,0.5299,0.5383,0.8924,2.9457,0.8712,4.2189,0.8535,0.501,3.7815,3.937,0.0039,1.6659,0.6809,1.4727,5.3713,1.011,1.7599,5.89,1.1284,3.8989,0.1373,5.172,0.7332,0.9673,1.365,1.725,2.7739,1.083,4.8243,0.4257,3.2643,3.6547,1.122,4.7551,1.0028,0.6947,0.8654,0.4097,4.5538,1.7697,0.2499,5.8055,1.9825,2.2851,2.0247,0.3737,0.5752,1.7492,1.2386,2.7958,0.0026,1.0674,0.0047,2.0761,4.4911,0.0102,0.4051,0.9189,5.0199,5.4853,4.9697]}
{"id":429,"ended":true,"length":514,"gen_text":"The long history of agricultural production, coupled with modern intensive agricultural methods such as pesticide and fertiliser use and runoff from contaminants into streams, rivers and lakes, impact the natural fresh @ water food chain, in turn causing population impacts such as reduced fertility and higher levels of diseases in water bodies, according to the statement.\n\nThe researchers say that the impacts are exacerbated by the large scale expansion of the global food sector and the food distribution system due to population growth.\n\n\"The effects are compounded by the large degree of agro-extraction, where human agricultural and fishery resources are extracted for private profit, and the environmental degradation of the remaining natural resources\", the scientists say.\n\n\"These changes are causing increasing pressure on natural resources. In particular, there is increasing pressure on carbon sinks such as trees and soils. Impacts from climate change can be expected to pose substantial problems in the coming decades\"\n\nThis can have cascading effects on water quality downstream and is potentially damaging to the fisheries, food and livelihoods of people living downstream.\n\n\"However, some of the key drivers of change in global food systems appear to be largely beyond our control. A major driver is intensification of agriculture, driven by increasing demand for food and by increasing per capita consumption patterns. These pressures are the result of population growth, intensified global food production which is currently occurring in many developed countries and urbanisation\", the statement said.\n\n\"Climate change impacts are a further major driver, increasing the risk of the risk of severe droughts, floods, heatwaves as well as increasing incidence of diseases such as malaria, which are a direct consequence of disease-carrying mosquitoes. Another factor is increasing intensity of land use activities, the result of population growth resulting in pressure on arable land\"\n\nThe scientists say that a key strategy is to increase the efficiency of conventional bio-energy production processes with the help of bio-insect biomass. Insects produce feed by digesting the plant tissues found in the plant's roots, shoots and aerial portions, and with the help of bio-insect technology, scientists are able to grow food crops under favourable conditions, eliminating the need for irrigation water and pesticides.\n\n\"The idea is to produce a range of viable crop species that can be grown as food, feed or biogas\", The statement said.\n\n\"This can be achieved by developing and modifying insect-based bio-energy species, using improved bio-insect technology, using more sustainable farming techniques such as less nitrogen and phosphorus and crop rotation, and reducing the use of high cost pesticides.\"\n\n\"We think it is worth pursuing if it leads to cost effective products that can be widely adopted, to improve our food security and reduce stress on the environment\", researchers say.","token_len":566,"entropy":[7.1332,4.312,0.1096,8.6478,3.5837,2.6789,4.9075,0.0097,4.206,7.0429,2.6862,1.961,4.1497,0.0052,5.5446,2.2149,1.6083,0.8619,0.5402,2.7669,9.0434,2.3481,14.335,5.0208,2.7077,0.8675,2.3479,0.3343,0.91,0.3393,9.435,1.3334,3.534,10.1539,17.9593,2.3271,4.9641,0.916,2.2994,4.6625,2.2094,3.3654,5.6229,5.1482,2.8636,0.0059,3.0536,3.5263,1.1096,2.7427,2.6638,0.0045,4.1739,3.2273,4.5029,1.509,2.1273,3.9083,0.0088,1.174,5.6595,0.1935,0.2162,0.0009,1.5724,3.7676,2.4505,1.221,1.7286,3.3947,2.1797,3.2485,0.2701,1.1298,3.9516,2.3231,4.657,0.0813,3.1435,2.3513,0.996,4.6378,2.0262,0.9269,5.5654,5.1649,0.4029,5.4614,0.0144,2.176,0.1068,0.965,0.4938,0.0003,1.1987,1.6339,4.3085,2.5548,3.8498,0.4189,0.4608,2.3395,6.9409,0.0545,5.4584,0.1985,0.3621,4.4679,0.1126,2.2727,4.3427,5.285,5.2839,2.5179,5.3819,0.0072,2.1011,0.2622,2.6277,2.1791,5.0986,0.6017,1.148,1.7814,1.0677,5.1684,2.2604,1.5818,1.9698,4.7615,0.7082,0.6189,5.6894,0.9334,2.9803,1.1592,0.1066,0.1356,0.0003,1.3897,3.1705,4.2205,1.6729,3.9115,4.5959,2.2796,0.1508,2.2421,1.0621,4.2108,2.8425,3.138,0.1133,4.2356,0.2824,1.7729,0.6628,0.1763,5.8282,2.5773,2.1541,0.003,5.5886,0.586,2.2871,1.8706,6.6173,0.0022,2.3237,2.3586,0.026,4.0106,2.045,0.6099,0.0921,6.0075,5.0051,3.0703,1.5156,0.89,2.6261,0.2284,4.1639,0.9604,0.0002,4.6609,5.1963,2.8553,3.6075,0.0015,0.4309,0.714,2.5329,1.7463,6.4035,2.5354,5.2041,4.9825,3.8481,0.3419,1.3303,5.0486,1.7763,2.7255,1.7242,2.2028,0.0929,0.1048,1.7459,1.7401,1.0082,0.5942,0.187,0.0002,1.4824,5.6493,0.0609,4.9512,1.5423,0.2896,4.7788,2.4938,0.4598,2.8607,2.0427,2.6821,1.2386,1.3405,4.2807,0.1185,0.1972,4.2429,2.1994,1.0699,0.3543,1.3685,4.5527,2.7032,2.1078,1.33,5.2657,0.05,0.2284,1.6856,1.1173,3.2476,0.2095,2.8844,1.5551,0.5247,0.4159,1.1217,3.2749,2.9378,5.2058,0.1301,1.1727,4.6004,0.9966,3.2389,3.4137,0.8779,5.2839,0.5409,0.0121,3.5025,0.1087,0.7337,5.7678,3.4992,1.8455,0.7134,7.232,1.0802,5.1208,4.23,1.9862,2.0822,6.577,0.2524,1.6699,4.9223,0.2289,2.3615,0.5973,0.7982,2.7134,0.0248,0.0714,0.0002,1.038,4.1684,0.0302,4.4258,1.4468,3.4295,2.9502,2.4669,0.9118,1.7259,4.7827,0.745,1.7495,0.1524,4.3814,5.1901,0.0882,3.5444,2.7278,0.0001,0.0002,0.7937,0.6595,0.8879,0.8864,0.4887,6.7066,0.0382,0.0068,3.2826,5.0067,0.1105,2.4571,1.2622,0.0031,0.854,1.204,1.8701,1.3725,3.6256,4.2038,0.9464,0.0143,5.6904,2.5833,0.5629,0.0009,0.4227,1.5708,5.5979,3.4637,0.6694,3.1875,5.3471,0.1416,3.2875,0.2346,4.226,1.0476,5.0703,2.5549,0.054,2.7216,0.2196,4.4225,0.2908,5.1803,0.2536,3.3326,0.0005,0.1208,3.7889,0.1874,0.0002,1.0419,1.5236,0.9421,0.3953,3.8397,3.5088,3.8514,2.0828,0.2834,3.1394,1.3837,2.3921,0.2202,6.3706,5.831,1.3707,1.7568,0.6197,4.8585,4.601,1.281,3.2707,0.004,2.8214,0.2359,5.6285,1.3954,6.5385,1.5402,4.5153,0.846,3.6552,5.0761,3.1179,2.1081,0.0004,2.7037,1.2561,3.1246,5.5079,0.1104,1.1684,2.7545,1.4725,2.9125,1.1721,2.577,0.5096,5.6559,3.6513,1.8486,1.7783,5.9039,1.0891,0.3448,0.005,2.2111,0.0898,0.2231,0.0047,3.859,0.7032,3.5699,1.4121,1.6158,0.0068,2.9828,4.7137,1.614,4.8585,5.1476,0.3385,1.9809,5.3854,0.4582,0.1199,0.2591,3.8755,3.6999,1.1604,2.2067,0.322,0.2314,0.0003,0.8233,2.0518,5.4936,0.5855,0.4887,3.0085,2.7903,4.2839,0.0034,5.1361,2.978,0.9933,1.5464,0.931,0.3973,1.0776,4.0441,2.322,2.136,1.5258,1.0183,4.0799,0.7375,0.0034,3.2419,6.7347,0.4936,0.3843,0.0652,0.3076,0.0002,0.7214,2.0977,2.8302,1.0254,1.1399,0.7712,2.9139,2.8742,5.5022,1.9276,1.4189,0.9213,1.0645,0.2238,0.8294,6.3187,1.6642,3.9875,5.2933,3.0112,0.0901,0.5415,0.004,1.317,1.2518,4.5812,4.3465,2.5294,2.1952,2.3755,2.5887,0.0033,5.2876,3.1972,1.577,1.3926,3.0756,4.7867,0.544,1.2588,0.9384,3.3197,0.9267,0.9959,0.0064,5.6123,3.8362,1.4108,3.2582,0.1988,0.0002,1.9178,3.0706,4.2519,2.6422,0.4616,4.893,2.4895,5.0559,2.7751,3.9989,0.0155,5.2955,2.1345,5.904,1.2549,0.9998,0.7834,3.1376,1.0837,1.8751,4.1474,2.4603,4.0677,0.5885,0.4643,0.796,1.8962,5.4196,0.1965,1.2859,0.6615,1.3016,6.3317,1.2156,0.121]}
{"id":4739,"ended":true,"length":519,"gen_text":"Following criticism over the sensitivity of their tyre compounds, tyre supplier Pirelli announced changes to their tyre allocation for the Spanish Grand Prix, making pit strategy the focal point of the Grand Prix weekend.\n\nThe allocation for the race will be reduced from the previous year, with ten of the existing 27 tyre compounds having also been added to the selection for the race in Barcelona, bringing a slight drop in the number of compounds that remain available for teams to select.\n\nPirelli say the changes to their allocation will make it easier to select tyres where tyres are at their most critical for performance.\n\n\"The changes have been made to make it easier for teams with more than one spare set to utilise them on a race weekend where they are most needed with less tyres available on hand,\" said Mario Isola, Pirelli's motorsport director.\n\n\"This is in line with what we have communicated all year, and allows us to make the changes to the allocation that are needed.\n\n\"We believe that this change will also help us to manage tyre performance so that during the season tyres stay optimised throughout. This helps teams in any number of ways.\"\n\nBruno Spengler, Pirelli's motorsport marketing manager, said: \"It is good news that the allocation to teams for the Spanish Grand Prix is being reduced so that tyres are available to each driver when they are most needed.\n\n\"We are doing this to provide the teams with more rubber on short notice for race weekends where they are most needed. This will be particularly helpful to teams who have a range of tyres available to them.\n\n\"Our research shows that the tyres that are available are very specific and only offer the teams a limited possibility on a particular track. This limits the opportunities for teams to exploit the tyres, which is why we are helping them in this way.\"\n\nHow do the changes to tyre allocation work?\n\nThe allocation of the tyres for the Grand Prix starts at 7.01pm on Friday evening and will carry over until the start of the race.\n\nThe final allocation will be made in the afternoon of Sunday, September 22.\n\nIf a given team wants the maximum three sets of third tyre (one of them being last used at the previous race) they can opt to select one compound from the three available and continue with the remaining compounds. They must also ensure that they have a spare set available for the race \u2013 if they do not they will be assessed by Pirelli on a case by case basis, subject to the new allocation.\n\nPirelli say they have not yet made a recommendation on how the allocation will be worked out, and so far this does not affect the selection of the final specification of the two compounds.","token_len":566,"entropy":[7.2819,2.7195,1.0172,8.4923,0.0881,4.3396,12.4309,2.5918,0.3439,5.5017,0.6022,0.4715,0.0001,0.0019,3.583,5.2965,0.4455,1.4139,3.1992,3.3544,0.8894,0.7105,3.3363,0.2234,0.0022,1.8722,4.6241,7.9225,6.6824,2.5634,6.1857,0.0025,0.4743,0.6177,6.2503,0.0037,1.3711,0.2164,0.2353,0.0019,1.5618,5.3036,2.5041,0.5302,1.014,1.9712,0.6885,5.4596,0.5346,2.6326,3.1895,4.3447,1.5241,0.7538,6.1634,3.1564,0.0819,3.933,4.0439,2.1099,0.048,3.1912,6.3769,0.0614,4.877,0.6185,0.1049,4.5523,3.0521,0.5948,1.0915,4.2678,0.843,2.6737,3.2223,3.6438,7.0592,3.233,0.2481,1.7383,1.2472,0.0714,0.6689,3.4682,5.4714,1.1314,1.2689,2.8262,0.7877,2.8523,0.9025,0.1249,0.0004,2.3072,0.0032,0.0012,4.3341,1.4814,1.7129,2.3287,2.0693,0.8141,1.5588,2.6628,1.3493,0.6687,1.4643,1.62,2.5603,6.4423,5.4951,0.8304,3.5814,0.1925,0.8766,4.0025,2.0964,1.2414,1.443,0.2706,0.0003,0.5938,1.3438,1.9351,4.4322,0.3817,0.3327,0.481,2.1187,0.6686,0.2141,0.5793,0.4006,5.3348,3.7212,2.2617,0.3945,4.7144,0.6065,1.2638,5.6963,0.0009,1.2961,4.0649,2.2178,0.582,0.3881,4.2593,1.4922,0.628,0.9547,1.1441,6.3028,3.5887,4.4297,1.6767,4.4455,4.5001,0.3979,0.6119,4.7687,0.0107,0.0012,0.0509,1.0596,0.0005,0.0005,0.7017,2.5835,0.027,0.409,0.0911,0.1477,0.0003,0.1217,1.9965,1.6029,3.0899,0.3637,0.0041,2.662,0.3832,0.802,5.2548,4.0838,1.257,1.2333,1.6986,4.9559,1.6626,0.0349,2.511,1.4966,3.4592,1.6825,0.655,1.2354,2.139,1.5243,1.4623,3.2404,0.4341,0.0003,0.0219,1.9288,2.9236,0.7581,1.4122,1.961,0.4484,3.5145,2.0813,3.6058,0.5952,4.1625,1.8196,2.7631,5.4073,0.381,6.753,0.6599,2.4839,2.6121,4.7729,4.0793,0.1626,3.7229,2.6951,2.5872,4.4865,2.0724,3.175,5.7567,4.3787,0.0012,0.2437,1.8116,0.2091,0.0003,5.9646,3.1873,0.0054,1.7309,0.4843,0.0002,0.1699,1.0029,0.0009,0.0002,0.4053,1.2434,0.0165,3.8874,0.9185,0.4122,1.46,0.4493,0.0075,3.0024,0.8154,2.9327,1.4219,0.6017,1.47,1.37,3.9277,1.638,1.7938,0.6216,0.6293,0.1852,0.0001,1.4222,2.2167,0.9268,4.7361,0.2053,3.6567,1.0007,1.539,1.6512,4.2945,1.1141,3.4755,0.8022,1.3014,0.4191,0.3835,0.5199,0.1411,0.0003,0.005,2.2889,1.8363,5.2359,2.2974,1.0044,4.1997,1.6856,1.7062,0.1698,1.8203,5.4356,2.6189,7.3244,0.2096,3.0249,3.357,1.3558,1.4832,0.9574,0.7554,0.5125,0.4937,1.3103,1.8499,1.3504,3.0994,2.1701,1.3795,2.1822,1.197,2.1155,0.9972,2.1812,4.9512,0.0124,1.7565,1.4248,1.279,0.756,2.6806,0.1834,0.0003,0.0109,4.3533,5.4546,1.061,0.0558,1.8318,2.238,1.9413,0.7977,2.5361,1.8454,3.531,4.6246,3.0844,4.4095,4.4144,1.9762,2.5037,1.239,1.3191,5.5948,4.7199,1.5391,3.6493,2.4268,0.867,1.6661,4.2039,0.4213,3.4631,0.5027,1.0146,0.2084,4.0714,1.4573,1.1075,3.1967,1.728,0.8325,0.8341,0.6645,1.5085,5.1962,1.1452,3.3838,0.5545,0.2669,0.3657,0.6837,0.0003,4.737,3.4037,0.8582,0.8865,1.6481,1.2836,0.1767,0.7596,0.0691,0.0796,0.0002,1.1526,1.3913,1.6568,1.6387,1.1339,0.8588,0.3387,3.9723,0.0004,5.9382,1.3238,3.7308,2.4751,5.9061,1.5883,0.6585,1.1042,1.9062,1.3442,3.0384,6.2706,2.0036,1.408,1.2821,1.8413,0.0025,0.6464,0.2023,1.8495,0.5923,0.0003,1.2939,4.5767,0.5873,1.1459,0.2218,1.4319,3.1489,0.4778,2.5026,1.022,0.9306,1.2582,4.3969,2.47,0.8915,0.4825,0.0003,4.243,1.1494,7.2949,1.5115,4.2526,4.8118,2.6061,4.9062,1.4,0.1298,7.1105,1.2553,3.6496,3.5546,2.4879,3.6456,1.7406,4.7542,2.0727,1.8168,0.6832,1.4319,0.0703,1.1725,1.1592,2.0583,4.8701,0.9797,3.2599,2.6572,4.0163,1.1878,0.7427,2.481,1.2631,2.5002,5.2366,1.2326,1.2375,1.3013,2.9609,0.769,4.3832,2.9418,2.3867,3.0895,0.5069,1.4705,0.8459,1.9593,0.7711,0.1737,1.5651,1.276,1.2343,0.5468,5.2812,2.2124,0.5281,0.8581,0.0566,1.8135,0.5252,0.9365,5.3073,2.4338,0.8242,0.0002,0.0006,2.966,1.9184,0.3207,0.7475,0.0026,0.0039,4.0118,4.2657,0.011,1.2542,5.2348,1.0816,0.624,0.1017,0.0004,3.18,0.0138,0.0009,1.7423,1.7128,2.299,2.9317,1.2813,2.2611,1.1091,3.4488,0.8726,2.4395,1.8124,0.9549,0.7724,0.3971,4.0762,0.3882,1.379,2.4348,4.5486,3.5627,2.9286,5.8346,0.032,2.8433,0.7368,4.3579,0.3373,1.2785,3.0774,5.6448,0.5327,2.0717,4.9465,1.3483,2.353]}
{"id":1194,"ended":true,"length":546,"gen_text":"Oscar Hornung left Eton College in 1914, intending to enter King's College, Cambridge later that year. When Britain entered the war against Germany, he volunteered, and was commissioned into the military in October 1917. He trained to become a fighter pilot, and by January 1918 was shot down and killed flying over Germany. On 26 September 1918, 'The Little Red Flying Man' landed at RAF Croughton near Ypres.\nWith this brief history of 'The Little Red Flying Man', the movie is well worth watching. \u00a0It's quite informative, and makes clear that the legend is based in fact. The Little Red Flying Man has always fascinated me, and I can't wait to watch the movie. I would love to see a re-release with bonus commentary from director Steve Miner, who is a well known TV producer and a well know film editor. Although the film is about the Battle of Epping Forest (and its aftermath), I really hope some time in the future, 'The Little Red Flying Man' is available as a complete set with all 5 parts, so some of the other elements of the film can be explored. If I was a film director, I feel confident I could have a film about this battle based on the events of the Second World War. \u00a0I could probably get a good one done. When I finished watching the film (and had already started to write about it), I realised what 'the Little Red Flying Man' really represents: the death of hope. I thought of that at the end of the film, when that pilot is about to be shot down over Belgium. What does this say about mankind at wartime, and about hope? \u00a0It means that we have entered a time of the darkest winter in human history, and in the midst of that winter, I know my little girl, her family and I are all in grave danger. If we think we can turn the corner, that we can save this planet, then those of us who survive will surely be condemned. The little Red Flying Man represents the dawning of a new era, when people begin to believe that we could be human again. If that dawning is not followed by a time of hope, then the planet will perish. My fellow Americans might like to know what 'war is hell' really means, and whether or not this war is just 'the war'. There is a good film for that, if they just go look at the video of that man. They'll see why I think the film is wonderful. If you are going to watch, watch this video first. You'll see that this man does not represent the true horror of war... if only they could see that. * - If anyone can find the full text for this story please send me a copy.","token_len":566,"entropy":[8.8915,9.8237,4.8566,7.3345,8.4742,5.4755,2.0205,1.1283,7.3814,1.8424,6.277,0.0414,3.7156,6.2323,0.1196,0.0106,0.8013,0.5787,8.1573,0.804,0.1065,0.3621,4.3803,6.6401,0.6546,0.2289,0.9597,4.4591,0.1149,1.1207,1.065,3.8032,2.8862,1.4447,1.1835,3.613,2.5276,0.03,5.5432,1.5684,2.9824,1.6494,0.1952,1.4485,5.1205,2.7768,0.8804,0.2634,3.4589,0.0425,0.6957,1.2323,4.0121,3.442,0.1152,1.2809,5.9379,0.0046,1.3308,2.1081,5.2923,2.4716,3.1283,0.2225,4.862,5.2741,2.9527,0.9877,0.3221,8.0882,2.5938,4.7034,3.3292,2.2072,3.3544,0.1286,5.8526,1.6605,2.3121,3.3685,1.4269,0.0359,2.6641,5.5969,0.0614,1.4351,1.7468,10.1897,4.1727,5.1376,2.5282,0.8216,3.0006,0.4121,1.0119,0.0365,0.4662,0.0121,0.7594,2.4481,5.4076,2.4718,4.4349,1.6149,0.7099,0.598,6.2048,0.0828,1.6511,1.9956,4.4728,5.3863,0.8251,0.5868,4.4426,3.8706,0.79,1.2162,3.9278,1.4912,2.9537,2.9687,0.461,0.4977,2.6302,5.1363,0.0078,0.2632,0.0089,2.984,4.2517,2.7096,0.1625,0.573,0.6016,0.8221,3.2697,0.4489,0.6716,0.1636,2.7064,0.6236,0.5856,0.9474,2.7831,4.2383,1.9368,0.075,1.2954,1.7767,3.3928,0.3779,1.1353,2.8461,6.5165,5.2249,1.5151,4.8845,5.2211,2.4553,1.0428,1.6801,2.4506,1.6815,3.4959,1.9499,5.7928,2.8863,1.1975,4.0123,3.1709,3.3173,2.122,4.7737,0.2731,6.0818,1.445,1.7662,0.9891,3.628,1.4457,3.7254,0.0086,4.9425,5.0465,0.081,3.3058,2.4244,4.207,1.8823,0.2903,1.5194,4.46,1.4664,5.2805,3.7611,0.7526,0.0129,0.1876,1.9017,4.8534,0.096,0.0264,0.0016,0.0152,0.0034,0.0215,1.0978,4.6918,2.0837,0.2419,4.7424,3.0605,2.3291,2.6108,4.6038,1.9967,1.6415,3.0866,7.0331,1.0826,0.2605,3.28,4.0743,0.9352,0.1483,1.5136,0.4405,0.1316,1.3276,0.6296,3.6388,3.6743,2.7619,1.4232,2.2156,3.4665,0.2637,0.275,7.4948,3.1157,1.47,0.2964,3.6706,2.4163,2.7604,1.9654,3.2348,2.0269,4.8359,0.3741,1.0683,3.3676,1.2232,1.3084,5.2546,0.0478,0.0025,0.9839,2.122,0.0319,1.7438,3.7065,3.5336,2.4301,1.6461,3.8799,5.1583,2.212,2.6371,6.5368,0.8231,5.3006,1.0156,1.1028,1.0647,4.4819,1.7028,4.2475,4.9478,3.0539,2.1078,0.9889,2.28,0.1511,0.3709,0.2274,3.4178,4.3793,6.1672,3.2057,1.6349,0.003,0.0286,0.0043,0.0152,1.6149,3.3032,2.3091,1.2752,5.4539,0.2252,3.9921,0.5152,2.9124,4.2961,1.3421,3.0196,4.2059,0.4711,0.7086,0.3031,0.2514,0.7282,0.5248,0.7265,6.2888,5.3318,2.3066,3.7933,0.0044,1.1823,0.771,0.1906,3.6302,3.7948,0.508,3.6018,2.8381,2.8907,3.0975,0.2806,4.8534,4.4612,7.1844,2.1061,1.0957,1.7982,2.9222,0.6524,2.1308,0.0072,2.3099,3.5605,0.4383,2.1656,2.0445,5.3814,0.5819,2.6588,0.4091,5.0576,4.2507,5.7118,1.5477,1.769,0.0672,0.956,0.7045,4.2648,1.2396,3.3737,0.0045,1.9225,2.0002,0.4973,4.0722,4.3111,4.8104,3.8937,2.5632,3.0476,4.5115,2.8792,0.7305,0.6089,2.2253,2.0059,2.767,3.3757,0.0732,0.1549,4.3065,1.8312,4.9495,0.9878,0.5492,4.1339,1.1644,2.8236,0.9348,3.4892,1.4425,0.374,4.8493,3.7782,2.1169,0.682,1.5816,6.4731,2.0193,0.0162,0.402,2.0554,0.6632,4.6444,1.1338,4.606,3.8223,2.9723,3.4194,2.0392,0.0252,0.0057,2.3465,1.3978,5.3604,1.1066,0.3383,0.7291,0.2058,1.2162,0.969,2.4968,4.3389,4.7043,0.049,3.1293,1.0545,2.1224,4.7557,3.2933,5.0236,0.6476,0.5169,3.4137,2.6432,1.8004,0.4849,1.2311,2.1036,3.1713,0.6253,0.9885,4.1468,0.2398,0.7499,0.3027,0.661,2.0314,4.6688,0.5012,3.0321,0.5152,5.0254,5.9133,3.1984,5.6994,2.9592,0.0681,2.5074,2.7959,3.4089,5.9666,1.4513,0.8224,0.2325,1.3376,0.0499,1.8612,0.8178,2.9269,1.9949,0.0056,3.4945,2.1303,0.7199,4.3229,2.6527,2.5394,1.8418,1.3022,4.7413,0.95,1.3882,3.8266,3.329,4.6895,1.1119,1.337,4.4827,0.6755,4.5653,3.3685,3.0808,1.4461,1.4914,4.2238,1.8706,3.5259,3.8079,3.6693,4.791,2.9082,0.9209,4.3104,1.322,2.1207,2.0959,2.8668,0.3695,5.8388,0.4853,3.4123,0.6952,2.1527,3.5241,0.0336,1.0892,4.305,2.3843,2.7315,3.0694,1.7472,1.0644,3.8148,1.2452,1.5229,2.2586,2.511,1.0736,4.7393,0.5506,1.6952,1.2094,3.95,2.8479,0.1012,0.2442,5.1745,5.7052,3.6013,2.6851,2.1452,0.434,2.3435,0.8687,5.8746,5.1807,4.1679,3.0299,2.5911,1.5337,1.6599,4.052,2.9565,3.0365,0.959,2.9675,4.5847,2.7195,0.6055,1.1517,1.8579,0.8501]}
{"id":4562,"ended":true,"length":538,"gen_text":"In addition to the flags used by the military, several other flag designs were inspired by the national flag. The former Japan Post flag consisted of the Hinomaru with a red horizontal bar, and three crossed sabres (red), while the first Japanese flag featured the Kanji for Japan in lower half and the kanji for \"hope\" for the upper half. The latter two flags are also used today on postage stamps.\nWith the beginning of World War II, and its subsequent occupation by the Allies, the wartime flag became a common sight at official ceremonies. However, it was only after the Allied defeat that the former flag was abandoned. On 11 December 1941, the Japanese Army adopted the Military Flag Act, which made civilian use of the Allied flag illegal with a one-year period. On 24 May 1942, the Japanese military ordered all existing Allied flags to be torn up, and military-issued replacement flags were used without the imperial coat of arms. However, many older and rarer flags were still left, and there are many rumors that some of these are still flying, so some of the flags have been reprinted in modern times, or are in the possession of museums. A number of Japanese historical accounts indicate that the Japanese began using the Allied flag in 1947 when they held full control of the South Manchuria, East Manchuria, and Liaoning Provinces. These reports cite former Japanese government officials as backing these historical accounts, however these accounts have been widely discredited by historians, and the dates given could not have been more than two years after the invasion of China. As the official flag of the state, the military flag for everyday use today is based on the Japanese national flag ( \u5357\u90e8\u65c5\u884c\u7cfb ). The Japanese flag is comprised of two horizontal stripes of red and blue; the central blue stripe is a white disk, which forms a circle with the word JAPAN (a kanji for \"future\") inscribed on each side of the white disk. The two other diagonal stripes are the same color, and are the uppermost stripe, which is normally used for military occasions. Other colors have also been used, including white (for use at night), green, white with three horizontal green stripes (which represent the four branches of the Japanese military) as well as red and yellow. The military flag is often displayed in place of the national flag during ceremonial occasions. The Japanese flag has a number of interesting attributes, such as its length and the fact that it is not considered a tricolor (a color consisting of different colors). For some odd reason, people who are not aware that the Japanese military used the Japanese flag also think it is a good idea to fly it from a drone (even though it has no bearing on the Japanese political or military situation).","token_len":568,"entropy":[2.8552,0.5121,1.2558,9.4547,4.7732,1.6359,0.6988,5.1932,0.511,5.0652,1.5582,4.7484,1.7963,1.4495,6.1582,0.0756,1.0197,5.2703,0.5889,0.9597,1.4096,6.7532,8.4628,5.0441,4.1407,5.8252,0.0542,2.1238,10.1087,0.7117,0.0309,4.0029,1.1675,2.0404,4.5452,1.6959,2.2702,2.0827,5.021,5.7351,5.1483,1.4879,2.8732,3.9551,4.7798,4.0159,0.1912,4.8894,2.2576,0.6656,4.1889,1.2789,4.2483,0.2424,1.0992,3.5076,1.9348,7.1937,8.0205,1.3883,0.9713,2.2734,0.0042,0.0643,2.4854,5.2406,1.5273,0.0707,4.8991,0.1765,0.7435,0.1797,0.2547,1.0588,3.0721,5.0685,0.6432,2.5992,2.6936,2.8548,1.6123,3.3621,4.5921,0.0153,0.8102,0.8952,10.7966,0.5737,4.6252,0.0047,0.7364,0.0012,0.1316,0.4423,4.9858,4.0901,2.5915,0.9257,0.9217,0.2367,1.8328,0.0895,0.717,5.7148,1.313,2.3116,1.4274,4.2136,1.6734,3.1788,3.9061,0.5663,1.4933,3.0115,0.0172,1.9846,0.5632,3.4792,1.1266,0.3865,4.8988,4.1725,0.8959,0.5075,4.1972,1.909,1.1792,3.9654,1.1661,4.6196,4.1961,1.9364,3.4686,0.1537,0.7202,1.8062,3.5409,1.4357,0.641,5.8595,1.6467,2.2735,0.7532,0.4621,3.5049,6.2564,0.33,0.0511,0.1454,6.6112,1.1594,0.5391,6.6171,2.4512,3.1988,0.2695,0.0447,3.1016,2.4202,2.7998,3.8362,2.4652,1.576,0.0606,0.3603,2.2946,3.9365,4.681,1.0909,4.1311,2.8603,0.5054,0.4647,0.0322,4.5594,1.7509,1.9494,0.8781,5.4281,3.7952,1.8833,4.4212,0.1113,0.4347,3.9106,5.673,1.6071,4.4392,2.9596,0.2008,0.001,0.3698,3.1803,0.008,3.4167,5.3417,3.7667,2.7862,1.8804,0.4105,1.337,1.7271,5.1254,2.8377,0.5831,4.7138,1.8654,1.831,5.5419,0.8991,1.4252,0.9066,0.6703,2.7399,0.3797,3.2878,3.4823,5.5798,4.3953,2.4342,0.8423,1.6725,3.3475,0.3095,4.9072,1.8293,2.5976,1.4379,2.9293,3.2532,1.5962,1.7348,1.7227,0.5574,0.0048,2.4217,0.8391,4.5634,2.5288,0.0217,2.8461,4.6542,5.8524,3.5057,0.07,0.8356,2.4254,6.6341,1.1023,0.435,3.3605,0.4407,1.7094,5.3527,3.7484,1.8307,5.0158,6.5057,1.6608,0.2779,0.5647,6.7446,2.5899,0.0015,0.1612,3.3257,3.4285,1.4541,0.0025,0.0033,0.2634,0.1005,3.1973,0.784,0.722,0.0,0.0001,0.8106,4.0037,4.4111,4.952,5.7556,0.8541,3.3669,0.9598,1.4814,5.9317,2.713,5.473,2.0722,1.266,3.645,3.7574,2.3341,1.2575,1.67,3.062,1.008,1.8125,1.0416,2.2338,0.733,1.9003,5.1456,1.4842,5.8159,0.7317,0.8386,0.4418,1.8409,0.6557,2.9633,0.3636,0.9912,0.3088,4.8496,0.7852,1.2742,0.662,4.368,2.108,5.2429,2.0625,0.4407,0.5695,4.6761,2.4381,0.3628,3.1971,0.3967,6.1891,6.9016,0.0833,5.7756,0.4531,3.8387,0.0928,0.1762,2.5774,2.4309,0.0167,3.8094,5.2976,2.8051,0.377,4.4857,0.0116,2.4429,2.2353,0.0926,0.0006,3.9924,2.6866,0.0104,2.5034,1.4733,2.2841,1.5111,1.2568,3.6977,0.0231,2.4688,0.9633,1.3792,0.8807,0.6119,1.4362,2.167,4.2815,0.9596,3.9452,2.3138,0.0702,0.7296,3.6893,1.5671,2.7569,1.6095,2.4167,3.937,1.1692,2.6152,1.4363,0.8134,5.1686,3.9382,0.5695,0.0022,0.7261,5.7748,1.8549,0.0005,1.098,0.3123,3.6381,1.6566,2.3193,1.3796,3.4055,0.506,2.0203,0.302,2.7764,0.3288,0.2521,0.6133,2.9868,3.4194,4.2686,0.0963,0.7479,3.0405,1.4144,1.348,1.2787,1.9049,1.6846,2.8649,4.4031,3.0263,1.5508,2.1224,1.4704,0.6916,5.8827,2.9162,1.2418,3.7288,4.215,0.9024,5.4383,1.9752,2.9392,2.3155,0.0358,0.1326,1.3308,1.4829,1.5657,2.3291,2.4822,5.5666,2.3085,3.4599,0.5121,2.5294,0.736,3.1138,1.7631,5.4669,1.8843,4.203,0.1506,1.1327,4.2997,3.0477,0.5779,2.7524,3.2381,0.015,0.1539,1.095,0.6444,2.5545,5.1671,0.2594,0.0095,2.0421,1.4814,1.3666,0.7468,1.0504,4.523,0.4135,1.1213,3.9364,2.6725,1.7151,4.0876,0.0025,0.0404,0.4521,0.0095,1.8401,4.0482,0.5553,1.1658,1.6786,2.189,1.1361,2.0999,2.4966,2.9226,0.0024,4.1256,4.4782,1.2601,2.4837,0.0059,1.6587,4.8781,1.5029,2.3336,1.6161,0.0198,0.6348,0.7206,2.5099,5.3747,0.6997,5.0527,0.0022,0.0497,2.5032,2.9021,2.6314,3.2264,0.0143,4.0928,1.0685,0.9332,4.1373,4.9443,4.9048,0.0402,0.0826,5.2639,3.5538,1.7163,1.3495,2.8859,1.8872,0.3967,0.5236,2.362,2.7781,0.3895,2.133,0.3191,4.0686,2.081,1.6101,0.5891,0.783,5.4736,0.9991,0.0642,1.94,0.7771,3.7116,2.2473,5.7467,3.2999,4.8662,0.2707,1.3472,2.7596,0.6249,4.2698,0.1106,0.6449,2.7599,5.5979,2.7668,0.2128,0.233,0.4555]}
{"id":4892,"ended":false,"length":523,"gen_text":"In the Victorian period, pamphlets started circulating in favour of the removal of the livestock market and its relocation outside of the City, due to its extremely poor hygienic conditions as well as the 'lair' in the City which was often frequented by prostitutes and other undesirable types.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, 'welfare' schemes were introduced as part of the War on Poverty, and the London County Council was given responsibility for the regulation and welfare of the City.\n\nIt is reported that in 1847, a prostitute was sentenced to death for killing a child in the City, after being found guilty of causing death by starvation.\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, it was announced that the meat market would be destroyed, and that an appeal to residents to help fund the relocation was made. Despite considerable campaigning by the community and the welfare agencies, this was not an easy task. The new market would have to be located outside the City.\n\nIn 1909 there was a public meeting and the plan to relocate the meat market was approved.\n\nIn 1916, a public meeting was held in London, in which the City Council declared that the City had no real objection to moving the meat market towards West India Dock. From then on, the City Council made plans to relocate the meat market. The plan was approved on the 4th January 1918, but the meat market had been razed during the war months, and the market is now located on the site of Whitechapel Station.\n\nThe relocation of the meat market took place in 1919. It was hoped that this would reduce the number of prostitutes that were present inside the meat market, and give visitors a view of the city from outside. In 1926, the meat market was finally relocated, and at the beginning of the 20th century the meat market was largely destroyed, and many of the stalls were moved to the East End. At this time the meat market had been reopened by the council, and the markets were renamed. There was one major change with regards to the food, as it was no longer sold solely using ox blood. The meat had become free range.\n\nA new meat market was opened on Sunday 30th June 1978, by the North London District Council. The area outside the slaughter houses is now open to the public. When you enter the meat market, you will now be directed towards the South Meat Market, the West meat market and the East meat market. The meat market remains open throughout the day, taking in meat from all of London's butcheries.\n\nFor information about London City Council's Meat Market and the work that is going on there on a daily basis, visit City Council Meat Market (www.city.london.gov.uk\/meat)","token_len":570,"entropy":[1.7422,9.8867,2.7546,0.4802,9.5968,0.0742,6.7697,3.6249,1.887,5.599,0.0071,1.4962,5.8856,0.0404,1.0225,11.808,4.5053,2.3507,3.5812,8.1379,4.7253,1.7769,0.6693,3.5872,2.4368,4.5166,0.0507,1.7945,7.6622,2.8928,8.995,0.0199,0.0049,0.0057,0.5884,5.7547,0.4125,0.0088,0.8247,5.238,3.8481,5.5129,1.3707,3.8461,1.5347,2.183,1.9285,0.9791,3.7809,2.6331,0.0003,0.0162,1.8531,1.0372,2.5934,1.6319,2.5919,0.4566,1.3993,0.0493,2.0476,1.3536,5.0933,0.1739,0.0032,0.0175,0.633,0.0043,0.1537,0.1762,5.1691,5.2188,1.8931,0.6361,5.5464,0.9375,0.8802,4.1249,1.7894,0.0034,0.6258,5.6613,1.5152,0.514,1.0923,1.9448,1.5538,4.8581,3.2943,0.1245,2.3953,2.6122,1.5912,0.149,1.1742,3.8773,1.669,3.2347,0.0255,0.8472,2.3268,2.9851,1.5512,0.0002,3.9493,2.0206,4.6709,0.1085,1.6593,0.7813,4.0333,0.4211,2.0257,5.7301,1.1332,4.3434,0.2064,1.4471,0.6681,2.6978,0.5963,1.8641,1.7687,1.1173,1.4278,1.6162,3.6871,2.9365,1.3379,0.5749,0.0767,3.5462,3.0759,0.1837,5.0144,0.8271,0.7719,0.0002,1.6245,1.6076,1.7186,2.7476,0.0862,0.0852,0.2656,0.0024,0.0422,0.0834,3.9236,0.3877,5.0287,0.1717,0.7627,4.9601,0.2304,0.4953,0.2343,4.4297,1.4743,0.8953,1.5731,5.006,5.7462,2.627,4.2961,1.1591,2.8132,3.4765,0.5573,3.2292,2.4062,0.8214,0.3262,5.0699,4.6015,5.4274,1.5907,1.376,4.2981,2.3718,1.5092,5.5181,2.8118,0.1905,3.6311,0.8306,0.7881,5.5579,0.6842,0.3514,1.213,2.428,5.0434,1.5862,2.0877,0.6338,0.293,0.1146,2.674,1.5496,1.001,0.1652,2.785,0.4884,0.0002,1.5841,4.3017,5.5326,0.318,0.5328,3.0214,0.6803,3.7908,2.3254,4.0377,1.7985,0.8074,0.3299,1.0457,0.0109,0.384,2.0878,0.6279,1.795,0.0002,1.9382,4.2661,0.4293,1.9392,3.2452,0.3454,0.2603,0.1089,1.9233,3.9905,2.0008,2.9265,0.5946,1.1487,3.4636,0.4944,4.3848,0.6672,0.722,3.1326,2.3827,1.418,5.9754,2.23,0.0513,4.5852,0.1198,0.9619,0.0079,7.2294,4.896,2.9059,1.1045,0.8668,6.6354,1.648,0.2723,0.3021,0.572,2.6328,0.3181,4.0633,3.3483,0.3554,0.9773,0.1051,0.5206,0.0045,1.587,2.8465,3.6022,0.5169,1.9145,3.0463,2.3347,3.468,0.0386,2.8472,2.3446,0.9908,2.8135,1.31,2.0826,0.0142,3.084,3.3817,6.4049,0.0211,5.0353,0.352,2.6387,5.3623,1.5486,0.5435,1.2276,2.8227,5.4077,0.8181,2.2236,1.6683,0.7233,1.2674,0.1251,6.0674,0.5507,0.0004,0.0001,3.0513,0.4437,0.2231,0.0002,1.4612,5.1754,0.6857,0.0504,0.2326,0.0035,3.0356,0.4279,1.2566,3.4639,1.3377,2.5605,0.4924,5.2005,0.0929,2.5419,0.4242,3.1695,0.3479,1.419,0.0059,1.071,2.8247,1.2809,3.5223,5.2057,0.1187,1.4319,0.0078,0.6464,0.7828,5.2639,6.834,0.7158,4.3824,0.1648,0.311,2.8199,1.2527,2.3033,0.7781,3.9447,4.4668,0.3413,0.8104,0.9765,0.0063,0.2333,4.3043,2.297,1.6997,0.8328,5.2681,0.743,3.9872,0.0105,0.7147,2.8019,0.0069,0.0381,1.9188,0.8722,0.0116,0.5898,5.5411,2.7204,2.2171,1.3279,4.6331,0.4442,0.3574,1.8986,1.0506,4.0278,0.7355,1.3241,4.256,0.504,0.5721,5.2569,2.1324,0.3612,1.8716,0.6995,0.0086,2.5066,1.939,4.962,3.1032,0.7545,3.6475,0.9527,0.7066,1.7336,5.3055,1.3071,4.2412,3.0724,5.0092,1.5203,3.7961,4.4604,1.6688,4.9191,1.8927,0.0238,0.1796,3.7214,2.5086,2.5461,2.5089,0.5786,1.9508,0.0018,1.8371,6.6467,6.6161,6.0221,3.2637,0.7557,1.9737,1.0567,5.2412,3.4622,4.5924,0.2146,1.9822,0.6095,0.0002,3.9841,2.4388,2.1393,0.0089,0.5383,0.8552,1.7218,5.4997,4.0998,0.0895,2.544,4.1316,0.5811,3.5841,0.4242,6.0641,0.8053,3.1471,0.4895,0.9328,1.3945,4.612,4.6936,0.313,6.2994,2.7388,1.959,0.725,3.2281,0.2548,0.1564,0.0416,1.3524,6.8984,2.7775,1.5282,0.3328,1.4545,0.0294,0.872,0.4163,0.9902,4.9342,1.3316,5.5029,1.9626,0.4363,4.7658,4.0265,0.2026,0.8008,3.7594,2.3993,3.157,0.0233,0.9632,0.1865,1.2939,0.2929,0.0072,0.2049,1.6799,1.1899,0.2894,4.3366,0.6716,3.6131,0.0309,1.6239,0.8454,6.2317,1.4449,2.8763,0.5536,1.3127,3.0033,1.1706,0.8763,2.8028,1.389,0.5133,0.7015,0.0002,4.022,2.9043,1.3913,3.1425,3.9845,0.7929,1.2649,1.0279,0.2917,3.0867,1.9885,5.5952,1.3041,2.2026,3.9385,0.1419,2.5973,6.6127,0.313,0.8809,0.0047,0.1468,1.8256,5.4429,2.842,1.8984,0.1852,4.2577,2.6446,0.0023,0.9382,1.6828,0.4379,0.0156,0.1189,0.0127,0.0019,0.0,0.5494,0.8035,4.1625]}
{"id":3347,"ended":true,"length":453,"gen_text":"An Oberst at 28, M\u00f6lders was appointed Inspector General of Fighters, a post responsible for deciding the ongoing tactical and operational doctrine of the Luftwaffe's fighter strategies. Returning to Russia in June 1940, M\u00f6lders was put in charge of planning the Luftwaffe's invasion of Poland in July 1939. After the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union that winter, M\u00f6lders served as chief of strategic planning and was forced to resign due to administrative mishaps after just six weeks of service.\n\nHe subsequently returned to Germany, where he spent the rest of the war as military advisor to the new Nazi-allied government in Italy. In December 1941, M\u00f6lders returned to the Far East on a civilian train, where he arrived just after Japan's surrender on August 15, followed by Germany's later unconditional surrender. On October 30, M\u00f6lders was appointed military governor of Singapore. From 1943 to 1949, M\u00f6lders served as honorary chairman and executive director of the German-funded, state-operated B\u00fcchel Institute for Advanced Research, a high school of the Nazi-allied East Asian Institute, based in Singapore.\n\n[14] This appointment came as something of a surprise to M\u00f6lders' admirers, but Hitler was impressed by M\u00f6lders' leadership abilities. His ability to organize, coordinate, and work with the various military agencies under his command had already caught Hitler's attention during the war.Although this appointment had political implications, it did prove the wisdom of allowing a civilian to take charge. This was as clear in the case of Generaloberst Erich von Brauchitsch-Eisenkopf, the commander of Germany's Western Military District and a future general in the Heydrich government When, in April 1945, M\u00f6lders was recalled to serve his last year in office, Hitler remarked: \"M\u00f6lders is my right hand.\"This appointment came as something of a surprise to M\u00f6lders' admirers, but Hitler was impressed by M\u00f6lders' leadership abilities.

His son, Hans-Peter, took up the position of honorary colonel and took his place in the ranks in the army.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Maximilian Eberhard M\u00f6lders.","token_len":570,"entropy":[10.9747,4.9516,6.6506,7.5792,1.4567,6.9434,4.5575,4.4482,0.1046,2.3003,8.1243,8.2531,1.1266,0.2988,9.2778,2.7133,2.2494,1.4541,6.9567,0.057,6.3824,1.7728,9.1767,5.935,2.5022,1.4828,6.2329,0.626,0.3283,1.6162,0.0001,0.01,0.0005,2.9411,1.0949,11.2285,0.3987,8.9674,0.4385,6.5912,1.0963,3.4316,2.8204,0.1537,1.0631,0.0015,0.0014,0.0021,1.4484,4.5134,0.1184,0.0287,0.0106,4.7377,0.6934,2.6073,0.0002,0.037,0.0004,0.0507,2.7218,0.0462,1.8654,1.9587,2.6224,3.5684,0.505,3.1315,0.7277,4.5724,0.904,0.5138,0.7673,0.1842,0.0023,3.9807,4.7162,0.0759,0.5031,0.0007,0.0012,0.0031,3.7197,0.3224,2.7735,0.1139,5.5756,0.2776,2.2572,3.0188,5.5481,0.0816,0.8997,3.968,0.0065,5.3192,6.0475,0.0278,5.2621,3.9425,2.1629,2.3207,2.7081,0.9359,0.2123,1.1936,0.0042,4.0705,4.531,2.0641,0.0372,0.8969,1.3605,0.5452,0.1359,4.1304,0.4834,0.8995,0.0017,0.2049,0.0602,1.2164,4.6149,2.1648,0.137,0.8878,3.5081,2.1567,2.2833,1.6502,0.0024,0.9156,0.9312,3.3357,0.4077,1.8551,4.0835,2.4891,0.1345,0.8691,0.0008,0.0017,0.0025,2.5164,0.0415,1.5965,6.6876,0.0064,5.5284,0.7441,5.44,5.5017,1.5997,1.226,0.0685,5.3594,2.8442,3.2812,1.797,0.6236,1.5583,1.7774,0.6621,0.1859,0.9497,4.0716,0.4211,2.6833,0.0475,5.9677,2.4443,0.0089,1.3462,4.0966,2.6939,3.7547,0.0573,1.2591,0.0011,0.0016,0.0033,0.8389,1.2527,4.2913,0.7228,0.0761,3.9744,1.2188,4.2634,3.6131,0.6151,4.7466,0.1593,0.6421,0.0008,0.0012,0.0038,0.7236,0.2186,5.8724,2.9744,4.2531,5.2449,1.1368,0.0334,0.1414,3.0297,1.049,5.423,3.8781,5.1638,0.0233,4.8367,5.3866,2.4925,3.3607,3.296,0.6623,2.3719,3.1999,2.1082,2.0237,5.8821,5.4208,3.5199,2.5845,2.8917,2.3198,1.0214,0.0004,2.4371,1.4844,3.969,2.4408,3.9054,0.2585,1.0931,0.2499,0.715,0.0002,5.9524,5.3534,0.0891,5.4863,4.2481,2.9272,2.7214,5.0602,0.0017,0.0421,0.283,0.6292,2.0657,0.0022,0.005,0.0022,3.4613,5.7181,0.0097,0.7936,4.0432,4.9714,2.2313,2.7229,0.7038,0.9746,0.0005,0.0023,0.0023,0.1274,3.8324,1.6316,1.609,4.6406,5.0187,0.1511,4.3328,2.8271,2.7873,0.3471,0.0684,5.6176,1.0823,2.252,2.2866,2.78,3.7615,3.8525,0.2091,0.5455,4.3354,4.4221,6.1563,1.5638,0.0023,0.5444,2.4718,0.53,3.3131,0.6954,6.1867,2.317,1.3292,5.5203,5.8829,1.5709,0.4512,1.6131,2.1834,6.4946,5.2831,3.9586,0.0282,4.6293,1.4747,2.1099,0.592,2.4961,1.6232,4.332,2.8052,1.5632,5.8337,6.9127,1.4649,1.1778,1.138,0.0241,2.8591,3.876,0.0009,2.7048,0.3411,0.4643,3.5283,0.001,0.0014,4.9455,3.8763,1.5039,1.5103,0.3651,0.0079,1.151,2.4726,2.171,0.17,3.4841,0.021,3.0141,2.9914,0.1215,2.716,1.8419,4.1393,4.2621,1.1614,0.7116,5.9816,2.9675,0.0014,3.2902,7.3483,3.9656,0.5973,3.0152,1.2598,0.0211,1.7429,0.0028,0.003,0.0025,1.0608,4.9167,0.6191,5.2036,5.1299,3.4552,1.6952,0.7887,1.176,0.5008,1.2176,4.1082,2.1872,0.7811,2.3593,0.0299,0.0046,0.0031,1.0159,4.9861,3.9357,1.2201,2.0275,1.0829,0.0004,0.001,0.0004,0.002,0.0006,0.0011,0.0007,0.0009,0.0024,0.0002,0.0001,0.0001,0.0045,0.0003,0.0,0.0012,0.0009,0.0116,0.0018,0.0001,0.0005,0.0016,0.0002,0.0001,0.0,0.0015,0.0007,0.0085,0.0008,0.4165,0.001,0.0006,0.0013,0.0009,0.0014,0.0009,0.0004,0.0006,0.0006,0.001,0.0063,0.0008,0.0016,0.002,0.0005,0.0004,0.0004,0.0001,0.0001,0.0024,0.0001,0.0003,0.0002,0.0008,0.0002,0.0017,0.0695,0.0002,3.729,2.9347,0.0003,5.5221,0.0286,0.008,2.2587,0.1271,4.6862,1.5367,0.0118,3.4933,3.3131,0.6417,0.1197,0.0008,0.0188,0.0012,0.1028,0.0002,1.7119,0.7566,0.1117,2.7167,1.1136,2.0595,2.804,0.1831,0.0455,0.2275,0.8842,1.1482,5.4727,1.1819,0.6738,1.443,0.0943,2.705,0.1442,5.1463,5.1225,0.0519,1.3859,4.3158,4.1179,1.6594,2.7028,0.0906,0.4149,4.6608,3.2623,1.1588,2.6807,4.7284,0.9843,3.4524,1.4062,2.8514,1.3549,3.8006,2.7053,0.6643,2.832,0.1195,2.7735,2.1469,1.8888,3.3841,2.7165,4.2434,1.1739,0.4175,3.8382,3.7838,1.5557,4.6499,0.9811,1.1041,0.0002,3.0923,0.0111,0.2628,0.0004,0.7487,0.4559,0.0002,1.4991,0.0083,0.3356,0.0002,3.4796,0.3715,0.0003,1.6862,0.1515,0.5311,0.0002,0.6989,0.2551,0.0099,0.0011,0.0011,0.0004,0.0001,0.1083,0.0274,0.0136,0.4375,0.0124,0.0057,0.0364,0.0006,0.0074,0.0027,0.1592]}

The line '' Bitch Better Have My Money, bitch better have my money (featuring Chris Brown) `` is the first of numerous profane utterances heard during ``California King Bed.\n\nAlthough a song about profanity does not fit into the label's current strategy of marketing to adult audiences, Rihanna and her management have stated that she plans on releasing records that may include a limited amount of profanity.","token_len":570,"entropy":[8.0865,3.4237,1.0546,11.1322,14.0547,5.3672,5.4762,5.2358,1.5522,2.127,2.1843,3.793,3.3912,0.1956,3.9574,2.7082,1.6417,3.1873,2.0599,6.7015,7.1156,2.1541,1.8552,1.6028,2.6053,7.8939,0.9101,0.2404,7.5595,0.0012,0.8161,2.707,0.0014,4.6696,0.8725,4.6337,0.0432,3.3519,3.2188,0.3181,0.0195,0.0037,0.003,0.003,3.1888,0.1027,0.7143,7.3939,1.0718,3.3152,3.0931,3.4509,2.0843,0.04,2.6062,2.7593,6.1029,2.5605,3.7109,0.1408,0.007,0.0143,0.0034,0.0061,1.1601,1.0828,1.1275,0.3328,3.4067,3.3177,0.0501,4.1597,4.6299,0.7081,0.4252,0.14,3.6908,2.9003,0.005,0.5398,2.6412,0.8528,4.7897,1.4264,0.017,0.0313,1.7764,0.9512,4.011,2.1798,2.2109,0.6753,0.8404,0.1938,0.6235,5.4363,0.4165,2.9367,0.397,0.1769,0.6812,2.0865,0.4224,0.563,0.875,5.7324,0.9371,0.1409,1.5965,0.1203,0.1008,0.0034,0.7453,0.3446,1.4582,0.7197,0.0037,0.0212,0.0224,0.0021,0.0059,0.4442,1.3855,2.7482,1.2653,0.9997,0.7564,0.0228,0.627,1.4819,0.2547,0.0278,0.0001,0.0022,0.5531,1.7761,0.6607,0.1174,0.0942,1.4757,3.0089,2.7677,0.393,4.6172,3.977,3.3523,1.1661,2.4096,3.733,5.124,3.4877,0.2184,0.9123,0.0002,1.6445,1.9998,4.7074,2.3377,6.0025,0.8869,0.0387,0.9892,2.116,4.4889,1.2096,1.196,1.385,0.4809,5.8301,0.0044,0.5827,3.2667,0.1712,2.7515,0.0055,0.1231,5.1688,2.7148,0.0208,0.1476,2.8408,2.5291,0.3181,1.846,0.1886,3.295,0.0003,0.0463,1.9822,0.1147,0.6303,0.0868,0.7809,0.0001,0.0014,0.0653,2.2006,2.2103,4.0206,0.0975,2.4128,5.7123,0.1572,0.0141,0.0589,0.0001,2.7954,4.7791,0.0169,1.1418,0.7966,0.0002,2.7517,0.9592,0.0038,0.0101,0.0101,0.0017,0.0074,0.2952,1.5994,1.3214,0.488,4.1048,0.0789,2.7379,2.0239,0.3475,1.9536,1.7664,0.9836,3.5112,2.0843,5.2625,0.0001,0.0016,0.2387,0.5067,1.8704,3.5061,3.5551,2.4153,0.0355,5.2228,0.0005,0.7643,0.0051,1.0567,2.054,1.363,3.4812,4.7917,0.6853,0.381,5.0468,0.0121,3.2241,4.9331,4.2905,0.0008,0.5872,0.1583,0.1006,1.7921,1.8021,0.2144,1.912,6.3685,0.0006,0.0003,0.2226,0.8462,0.0002,1.2967,0.8092,1.1055,5.1136,1.8788,0.4705,3.9718,0.315,4.4613,0.2457,0.0046,0.3828,1.186,0.9606,0.0007,1.6177,2.4474,2.2459,0.6466,1.4239,0.4862,0.0522,4.0792,0.0969,0.0133,0.0018,1.0984,1.2195,0.3475,0.0021,0.0035,0.0066,0.0013,0.0013,1.3261,1.4152,0.017,5.2641,0.0016,0.1805,0.0056,4.2677,0.478,3.2286,2.1721,0.0472,2.246,0.3252,2.1733,0.0013,5.4929,2.02,1.2783,0.1868,5.0327,0.0073,0.1929,2.7775,0.0653,0.0059,0.0041,0.4522,0.1547,0.428,0.0065,0.0022,0.0062,0.0006,0.0031,0.4072,1.9355,2.386,0.7519,3.5569,2.6862,0.4574,1.751,2.6782,1.8377,0.519,1.7736,0.1362,1.0615,0.0986,1.6191,1.0232,0.2748,0.4846,7.2814,0.4049,2.8583,1.8239,1.8125,1.3619,0.6735,5.2024,2.6073,0.1953,0.5342,0.2197,0.7392,1.3828,5.6032,1.9042,2.2838,1.8317,0.6179,0.7737,1.4514,1.8787,0.4558,5.3388,5.3461,0.5242,0.8755,0.2295,0.1104,0.7798,0.1053,0.5894,0.0002,1.1761,0.61,4.5808,4.0034,0.0075,0.0155,0.0115,0.0028,0.0059,3.0165,2.5789,0.9611,1.7565,0.0045,0.5971,0.4278,2.563,1.9662,1.4356,0.0673,0.3909,1.1173,0.59,0.1077,1.0926,0.0327,0.0028,0.1212,2.3657,0.5025,4.3012,1.3979,1.8449,2.5541,6.6879,4.7027,0.9607,4.1732,0.082,2.7511,0.0123,1.0033,6.2621,0.4406,3.0803,0.3085,0.5418,0.0005,5.6968,1.2835,4.7578,0.8182,0.9371,1.7789,2.0952,0.04,0.5682,0.0329,0.0111,0.0251,1.972,1.922,0.3011,0.0554,0.0117,0.0877,3.6748,0.5701,0.0172,0.0584,0.0076,0.2401,0.7694,3.5817,3.4838,2.6431,2.2621,2.0825,0.8041,1.2752,2.4586,4.2567,0.3399,6.3508,0.0019,0.0102,1.8101,0.517,3.9943,2.4528,1.538,2.0718,4.163,3.169,0.8859,0.0045,0.8577,0.0276,0.0046,0.0154,0.3324,0.0514,0.0048,0.0054,0.0024,0.0153,0.3475,0.0261,0.0032,0.0182,0.0058,0.0327,0.2816,1.2244,2.7063,1.8004,2.4486,4.1624,3.4934,1.7728,5.8522,0.0232,4.2866,1.783,3.9612,1.388,0.0035,0.0011,2.668,1.1261,0.0002,5.3896,4.3906,3.1009,2.6541,6.1617,0.1972,4.0691,0.1109,2.5439,1.9361,0.6593,5.8237,0.3739,3.8428,4.3425,1.488,3.8768,2.2367,5.144,0.7565,0.1145,2.804,0.0012,3.6611,1.1012,1.8694,1.3627,2.1238,0.2406,2.1532,3.2461,1.8184,1.286,7.0588,1.1651,4.5786,3.2603,4.423,5.4386,1.0695,0.0034,0.369,0.1263,0.5796]}
{"id":2578,"ended":false,"length":478,"gen_text":"The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. H\u00e4kkinen said that he was `` pleased `` to win the race and admitted that he had never won one before in the sport: ``I've never raced at the Nordschleife with all the cars on top of each other,'' he said. ``It's probably the most exciting time in the world of Formula One. It really is.'' This was his second time coming to the Nordschleife in three years.\n\nWhen asked if he was feeling any pressure for taking the lead in the race, H\u00e4kkinen said: ``For sure I feel fine. I don't feel pressure on me for any way since I've never been involved in the championship battle. If you want to win the championship you have to fight more than one place behind the cars in front.''\n\nHe was also proud of his car: ``The car looks really good and is very reliable. It's really fun to drive.'' H\u00e4kkinen's driver coach, Jan Aerts, won his second consecutive driver's world championship with H\u00e4kkinen. Aerts' contract with Ferrari was not renewed last year.\n\nAfter the race, H\u00e4kkinen said he was disappointed to lose the race to Mears, which was the quickest lap achieved by a Ferrari driver. H\u00e4kkinen said he had `` the fastest car and the fastest driver.''\n\nAt the press conference at the end of the race, H\u00e4kkinen had expressed his regret that he had lost the race to Mears, and he thanked his fans for the very high support they gave him, and for the `` amazing atmosphere in N\u00fcrburgring, Germany.\n\n``I know Mears is a little bit disappointed with the result, but he didn't lose this championship with his first-lap speed,'' H\u00e4kkinen said. ``It was the fastest lap Ferrari has ever achieved during the weekend.

{"id":4455,"ended":false,"length":533,"gen_text":"The Stripped Mixes received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics. Writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave The Stripped Mixes two out of five stars, stating that he felt that `` the logic of '70s prog rock is entirely missing from the production. The group lacks the clarity -- and the cohesion -- that would have let us know if the prog-rock that's supposed to play a part here could have done so. '73 is really stripped down prog; '74 is just weird. The songs feel disconnected -- no sense of cohesion between songs or themes. And at times, it feels as though the four members are struggling to find a common denominator. (For instance, the most coherent aspect of the compositions here is the title track -- which is actually a rather odd composition.) The group's best work is probably '74's Lullaby, which shows considerable effort to find a thread running through the songs -- but it's simply not cohesive enough to really stand out, considering the overall messiness of the mix, and there's so much here that sounds like it was recorded in a studio during the second world war. Erlewine felt that The Stripped Mixes really lost the band's sound as it found itself having to compete for attention with a new wave of psychedelic pioneers. He concluded that the band's attempt to reinvent themselves by recycling elements of previous generations probably fell flat, with only a few small successes. But then what purpose does a band like the Stripped Mixes serve except to promote the work of the other alternative prog kings in the genre? If that's as clear-cut as Erlewine's opinion gets, one wonders how much further we're likely to hear the group; it's hard to imagine that a group the size of The Stripped Mixes would be left for dead after playing an entire U. P. C. in '71. --------------- I am a bit perplexed by the response to the final track on The Stripped Mixes; for myself, it was a very interesting piece of work, and it certainly holds its own with The Ballad of the Space Ant. It has a distinctly prog-rock feel, which could help it to get some attention at shows. However, the band seems completely absent of the original prog rock flavor I am trying to pinpoint in my list of potential successors to the Beatles: there were just too many heavy elements in the composition. It's just not there yet. If anyone has any additional insights to add to this list, let me know. I would like to think that the next post will examine The Stripped Mixes in a little more depth, since they seem to have so much work ahead of them. So that's it for now! Next time, the '70s alternative prog kings!

{"id":1568,"ended":true,"length":512,"gen_text":"The volcanic island of R\u00e9union is only three million years old, whereas Mauritius and Rodrigues, with each their flightless < unk > species, are eight to ten million years old, and both are volcanically active in the Atlantic Ocean.\nIt is interesting to note how these islands formed. In all other respects, the continents and their continents seem somehow identical to humans. The volcanoes erupt, and humans live on the continents.\nWith this simple theory of development, it becomes clear that the continents must have been pushed together on each other, and this is where human evolution got off-track.\nWhen was this first hypothesized? The earliest archaeological finds from the Americas were of humans and the hominid group, suggesting that humans came out of Africa.\nBy the 4th century AD, however, we know that people were already in Spain, and that they reached Mesoamerica, which was inhabited by the non-African H. erectus.\nFrom what we know about the Americas from archaeology, people there did not change very much, nor did they have any large body of interbreeding with early Africans. This suggests that the continent in which the first inhabitants of the Americas lived - as some have argued - was already too small for interbreeding to occur (we can only assume that the island where they developed was too large to be stable, which probably makes it the right place to build the pyramids... ).\nThat is, homo naledi and homo erectus were already existing there when H. erectus arrived. When homo erectus reached the American continents, homo naledi was already there too.\nIt is important to point out that this does not make the idea of homo naledi a myth, but only a hypothesis. It does not say that homo erectus did not leave Africa at this time, or that there was a single wave of hominids entering the Americas. It merely gives greater clarity that those early American hominids were not necessarily the ones who left Africa.\u00a0\nBut what about the Pyramids? These are still an open topic, and we still don't have a definitive answer about how they came to be. The theories range from some of the ancient cultures building them themselves to some divine creation.\nPersonally, personally, I think it was the former: we were just around the corner from all the things we now value in ourselves, yet still wanted more, so we created these things. They made us want to go more in that direction. As a result, we eventually, through our own hard work, became the people standing in front of the Pyramids today.\nIf you liked this article on Ancient Origins, consider becoming a patron!\nThis entry was posted by Richard Beck.

{"id":22,"ended":false,"length":495,"gen_text":"Cullen made his NHL debut in 1988 \u2013 89, appearing in 79 games with the Penguins and scoring 49 points. He was given a greater role with the Penguins the following year after he played in one game in the Stanley Cup Playoffs and scored 1 goal.\n\nThe Penguins traded him to the Washington Capitals on March 9, 1989.\n\nAn All-Star in 1988-89, Cullen's offensive ability was part of the original draft deals that saw the Penguins acquire Mario Lemieux and Mark Recchi in 1985 and Patrick Roy in 1986.\n\nThe Washington Capitals selected Cullen with the 6th pick in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft. On January 4, 1993, he scored the first overtime goal for the Capitals. He then finished with 42 goals, 67 assists, 121 points, and an NHL-high 226 penalty minutes in 212 games, making him one of four players to record 40-plus goals with the Capitals (Mark Messier, John LeClair, and Craig Simpson).\n\nIn 1997, Cullen was again traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets. He scored 10 goals and 20 points in 70 games with the Blue Jackets, finishing with a minus-20 and a plus-24 for the third consecutive season.\n\nAfter two seasons with the Blue Jackets (1999-2006), Cullen played the 2007-08 season with the Tampa Bay Lightning, which was the first time he wore a Lightning uniform. Cullen had 13 goals and 34 points in 47 games, leading the team with a plus-12 rating. He had a 30-goal season with the Lightning that included six game-winning goals. The Lightning had an 88-point season.\n\nHis offensive ability was no longer enough to justify keeping him with Tampa Bay and traded the team to Florida on July 1, 2008. Cullen had two goals and 10 points in 61 games, his last in the NHL.\n\nCullen then signed with the Buffalo Sabres before being traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs on March 2, 2009.\n\nWhile with the Maple Leafs, Cullen scored 9 goals and 30 points in 76 games, going plus-23 while averaging 20 minutes of ice time.\n\nCullen signed with the Boston Bruins at the 2011 trade deadline on March 2.\n\nHe recorded a goal and two assists during his rookie season, but a knee injury ended his 2010-11 season.\n\nAfter one season in the NHL with the Bruins, Cullen signed with the Winnipeg Jets on July 20, 2012.

{"id":3215,"ended":true,"length":542,"gen_text":"Some critics were dissatisfied with the scope of the novel. Daniel Mendelsohn of The New York Times Book Review wrote that thematically, there was no reason that a Greek should be an intersex character nor any point that she would be anything except what she was. \"[T]he fact is she was a woman from birth, born a woman to a Greek-born man,\" Mendelsohn wrote, but she had never identified as a woman. \"That [was] so long and far between as to have nothing to do with the main plot\u2014she does not even have a backstory.\"\n\n\nStill, she's far better than The Woman in the Fifth (2013), by James Patterson, which I reviewed recently on my site. That book featured multiple, long-lasting relationships between characters who were not identified as trans women. The main character, Trudy, a transgender woman with a long love life with the son of a wealthy family member, had the opposite experience as the woman in the Fifth. As part of their story, however, the main characters fell in love, made some money and married, only to have their relationship collapse after Trudy left them and began having sex with her new partner.\n\n\nAnother problem I had with the Fifth is that it is very poorly researched. On the one hand, Mendelsohn, who was also the author of the best-selling book \"The Gifted,\" had been to Greece. On the other hand, he had no access to the archives where the book is set and had no sources for his information. Mendelsohn writes that the characters look like \"a certain type of Greek,\" and he does, but the book does not make it clear, and I can't tell whether he meant trans women or trans women who had had long-term relationships. One character, a Greek woman, was apparently mistaken for a man and forced to wear the men's clothes she was wearing before she had surgery. On the other hand, there was a lot of information about the time and place and people, and he even makes it clear that some people did crossdress or at least thought they did. So Mendelsohn had some sources to go off of, but even if you did turn the characters' genders into some kind of \"male\" or \"female\", you'd still have no information about just how and why those people began to crossdress.\n\n\nIt all just feels wrong, but we will not likely ever know what really happened to the characters in \"The Trans Girl in Athens,\" because there, it is fiction, it is a work of entertainment, it is not meant to be a work of science or history. But that would really be a shame, because the main character, who identifies as female, really got a lot out of publishing this book.","token_len":574,"entropy":[6.9524,4.1769,7.6274,0.482,0.5298,6.6942,0.2466,0.2979,8.3345,1.6663,7.2085,3.2998,0.0455,0.0024,0.0,3.4305,1.5906,0.6581,0.4684,0.13,5.444,0.0009,1.4696,0.86,11.7875,0.399,0.697,4.5034,0.9658,2.6903,2.898,5.1931,3.0573,7.4197,6.317,1.5061,4.7042,5.3674,5.154,1.5994,7.2572,3.9675,6.149,2.9253,2.9106,2.0927,0.9743,4.7101,4.8439,3.4909,0.2811,0.6851,1.1727,5.4019,1.7898,0.0098,0.4527,4.2258,2.8278,4.2163,2.8835,1.6174,2.2286,3.6659,2.1166,1.0396,2.7778,1.3762,0.8984,4.3248,0.6894,1.5456,4.0512,1.8675,2.5797,2.0529,0.7561,0.0103,0.0003,0.0002,0.4082,1.9892,4.593,2.9534,2.7213,3.1722,2.7352,0.2419,0.6756,0.5473,0.7077,1.3905,3.7818,5.5923,2.9974,0.062,5.8037,2.0027,6.085,3.756,4.7975,1.7115,0.0508,3.7091,4.0782,0.1074,0.0283,0.0114,1.4279,5.2634,2.1439,5.2492,3.6086,4.008,0.3476,1.7996,1.9619,0.5303,5.5535,1.3643,4.7303,0.0003,4.7895,0.1123,3.6446,3.407,4.9923,3.9528,0.4262,5.9184,5.4334,0.3665,0.8034,2.7448,3.695,4.1493,0.4905,2.4557,5.0527,1.8872,0.4457,0.7173,5.8724,1.7297,3.2255,4.051,1.9406,2.3809,0.3931,2.6965,0.7895,3.3504,6.819,4.1402,5.2971,1.039,4.2598,1.5584,0.9806,3.947,0.7745,0.9998,2.2408,4.5797,0.1675,2.3039,2.4142,1.0965,1.942,2.8181,0.4198,0.9706,5.9431,2.4968,0.02,0.4724,3.9294,3.5861,0.4933,4.2116,0.8879,3.1131,5.8095,1.3867,3.6027,3.3671,4.171,0.0509,0.6738,1.6404,1.9484,7.2265,0.1251,3.1661,3.7728,4.9758,1.7521,1.9053,2.4941,4.4483,0.3853,0.849,2.536,0.7535,3.9775,5.0776,0.0016,3.4018,3.9364,0.1419,6.592,0.0101,1.6423,2.9178,0.2905,5.0663,0.0934,0.0071,2.3792,5.1146,5.3089,3.4545,2.3145,2.9159,1.7898,3.1065,0.062,1.3692,1.6394,1.9717,2.9192,2.4787,1.2012,0.0018,0.0004,4.0522,3.1995,2.5527,2.564,3.5788,0.6878,0.075,2.8137,3.1425,1.3285,0.3435,1.8761,0.0003,4.716,2.6734,3.2561,0.6827,0.0611,0.6721,3.4725,1.9316,0.2534,1.0484,2.3287,3.7981,5.9648,2.9334,0.3771,5.5606,0.9416,1.9894,0.0101,0.049,4.0455,0.0089,0.0007,0.0007,4.0053,0.9926,2.8431,3.6529,1.7403,1.6809,0.0448,1.1178,4.75,0.4606,0.1391,2.1563,3.6661,1.1333,4.7264,3.7809,0.9383,3.5316,4.188,2.6515,0.2981,2.7007,1.6251,0.0067,0.0027,0.3749,0.0089,1.2782,2.3318,1.7917,4.0454,0.0214,1.3265,4.1095,3.7401,0.7745,2.6504,1.6868,0.7765,2.089,2.7977,1.541,5.3237,1.2675,1.3184,1.9473,0.2453,3.44,0.005,0.0009,0.0003,3.5797,1.0975,1.338,3.9332,6.8143,1.4316,1.6949,2.3744,6.3155,1.3171,0.0643,0.6975,3.0689,2.1449,2.0859,3.5326,2.6815,0.5075,2.3151,2.4321,2.2856,0.0666,3.035,1.4741,0.165,4.792,2.63,2.3889,3.537,0.2396,2.5874,2.5292,1.0871,2.0664,3.7664,0.6028,0.3957,1.9626,3.1355,0.9683,2.7308,2.4835,5.3972,0.4424,0.1757,0.2737,2.3366,4.6361,0.7704,1.4159,2.677,2.6623,2.0504,1.0554,2.5873,4.9586,5.5986,0.2118,0.2159,0.8458,2.3083,3.955,0.4639,1.7537,4.2794,2.2626,0.0024,1.0734,1.5374,1.4318,2.873,2.3833,0.8887,1.9868,1.9737,0.8976,4.4016,0.8295,0.6064,0.0114,0.0083,2.5683,2.2885,1.1649,2.8502,0.1621,2.5214,0.9928,1.0273,5.4186,1.7206,0.566,2.8824,2.5994,2.7342,1.269,4.1413,5.2413,4.1814,2.4454,0.2005,0.2525,2.9015,2.7911,3.4311,5.1595,1.7339,3.4168,3.6078,0.0144,4.8103,0.7368,0.4439,0.3332,4.2414,3.0304,0.0039,0.0016,0.0004,3.2268,2.2558,2.3172,2.114,2.1081,2.995,0.2146,0.7662,0.6556,4.8199,2.0706,2.6453,4.5221,6.1087,2.8814,2.0861,3.0523,3.4837,0.6681,3.8625,0.904,0.0023,4.2429,4.4425,0.4983,0.3776,0.0126,0.0041,5.4641,1.5145,2.1259,0.5203,0.6213,3.1509,2.6134,0.4726,6.5912,0.6147,3.9226,0.4593,3.657,1.5926,5.4344,1.0907,1.1009,0.1622,0.5956,0.7084,0.0003,3.9815,5.1457,4.5298,2.4562,3.38,1.7143,3.1287,5.1853,4.4322,3.196,6.2974,1.3733,0.3267,2.384,1.6655,0.1422,1.402,0.997,1.1654,0.5741,1.6719,0.1321,6.2285,6.2507,0.9511,0.8346,2.0354,2.0586,3.1949,7.3907,3.0662,1.5004,5.3922,1.8296,4.6587,0.3173,2.6646,2.4165,0.0296,4.7146,0.6548,1.7197,0.2659,1.0719,2.4183,0.0867,0.3511,2.009,3.9056,0.0126,6.0458,1.3827,0.5982,0.3873,3.0277,2.7695,5.5827,5.6843,0.8088,1.4819,0.4574,0.7884,0.2306,1.5797,4.696,0.6052,1.1098,3.1533,4.4908,0.1231,2.6093,0.2904,4.1264,5.2953,1.4263,0.7412,1.9913,0.0024,7.563,1.7396,0.5529,0.5491]}

{"id":4752,"ended":true,"length":527,"gen_text":"Sebastian Vettel's dominant run was derailed in Abu Dhabi when his car was found to have insufficient fuel after qualifying and he was subsequently moved to the back of the grid. As Lewis Hamilton's success in qualifying enabled him to secure third on the grid he needed to ensure he did not make any mistakes in the race should he be able to keep up to Hamilton's pace.\n\nThis could not be done with Vettel as he began his first run behind the safety car and when the grid restarted he was unable to overtake Hamilton, forcing him onto the grass and then into the barriers.\n\nHe was uninjured but suffered a puncture from the accident causing him to miss the rest of the race.\n\nVettel has since expressed his regret with his actions. \"I know it's going to be interpreted in a lot of different ways but it's a mistake that I will learn from,\" he said.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it got me off the pace. As far as I can see I was on the limit, but at the end some of the other drivers weren't and that's racing. If I was driving in that position, there's not many drivers I would have got past. If you look at Lewis, he got very close to me, so the way to keep the pace was to get out of the race on the fresher tyres and then I went off.\n\n\"In the end, I don't know what I should have done; there could have been a bit more aggression.\"\n\nDespite the incident Vettel expressed his satisfaction that he had completed the race and said it was \"a little bitter-sweet\" to complete it with a puncture and a puncture that forced him into the barriers after he had already been on the limit.\n\nHe admitted that his thoughts at the time were on Hamilton. \"You could see Lewis is in the lead so I was a little bit worried about losing the race, maybe just by a second or two, so just trying to stay out of trouble with the brakes, going onto the race start, that was really crucial.\"\n\n\"I want to congratulate Lewis he did a great job. He's the champion of the world and that's what he did tonight.\"\n\nThis was not Vettel's first encounter with danger this season. When he and Lotus team-mate Kimi Raikkonen collided at Silverstone a few weeks ago Vettel's car was badly damaged. The damage to his car forced him to retire.\n\nRaikkonen's team-mate Jenson Button also lost control in the pits last week when his car ran long on one of the pitlane turns, and this has led to suggestions he could be sidelined for the remainder of the season.\n\n\u00a9 ESPN Sports Media Ltd.","token_len":574,"entropy":[7.8348,0.3067,0.1239,2.1985,0.0029,3.1628,5.7881,4.0056,3.2349,5.5359,2.4686,4.5204,0.0016,1.7134,2.3587,1.7055,2.2737,4.1635,0.0491,0.8717,4.8589,2.6385,4.4956,2.9833,2.9954,1.1455,1.1699,4.4692,5.5952,1.0759,0.6046,0.2707,0.0557,0.0201,0.1199,0.6437,5.6334,7.7611,0.0096,2.3031,6.0754,0.9637,3.0034,5.9663,0.1165,0.0182,3.398,3.1085,3.0283,0.1383,0.0177,3.4785,5.2248,0.5349,3.9867,0.7993,2.1564,0.0492,3.4248,2.3568,0.2616,0.9759,0.6073,0.068,6.8374,0.4937,1.5214,2.4754,0.0063,4.5944,1.2624,4.1419,2.4164,0.8897,0.1096,0.237,1.0115,0.0032,4.0372,5.1438,1.8078,0.2237,0.7977,3.0633,1.8443,0.011,2.2402,0.7839,4.9506,2.3135,2.4958,2.7804,2.2165,0.7804,0.4921,0.0132,2.1706,4.6699,1.3677,4.9367,3.6641,0.0036,0.5979,0.9422,2.3445,0.0042,4.5007,0.8009,2.6933,3.6632,0.2825,3.1201,0.1232,2.8115,1.364,3.5879,1.8325,0.4765,0.9038,0.508,1.3142,0.0003,3.4709,0.9637,4.1972,0.0002,1.7897,3.855,0.7623,1.0769,0.2836,4.2095,0.7034,3.8008,5.3892,0.7478,0.0369,1.6461,0.4785,1.5399,0.0061,0.083,0.0963,0.4277,0.7096,0.0003,2.6019,0.0098,2.9808,2.3337,3.6635,0.2714,1.8451,5.3511,1.1713,2.1935,2.063,1.4615,0.9383,4.0988,1.9211,1.3118,3.7892,0.0139,0.6082,5.4012,1.3404,0.8499,3.6512,0.0429,0.2705,0.0103,1.1432,2.0696,1.2302,2.6651,3.493,1.8735,0.5399,2.8876,2.1314,0.0226,1.0936,0.2061,0.1685,0.2057,0.874,0.0003,0.5533,4.4919,0.3129,0.8248,0.0376,0.033,0.0545,1.3551,1.5725,7.5759,0.5803,4.0202,0.4135,0.8175,1.9322,4.9374,3.4971,0.003,0.4434,2.8993,0.7757,2.1131,1.5839,2.042,0.3916,1.9368,2.3038,1.6575,3.9749,0.2914,0.3813,9.0168,3.2723,0.6767,3.1036,1.2394,2.6788,0.0003,2.6184,1.4561,0.7153,2.3454,0.6666,3.9391,1.0681,2.4604,4.9166,2.5775,2.5513,1.909,1.8408,4.4273,0.9206,3.4586,3.3567,1.8008,1.7121,0.7811,1.6543,3.2629,1.228,1.0743,4.4067,1.8984,2.0727,0.1641,3.2702,1.1688,0.8168,3.5157,4.8895,0.3476,0.614,0.3404,2.2252,1.5912,4.3843,4.6148,3.5215,4.3649,2.0717,1.7148,1.3001,0.4211,2.6246,3.0967,0.2444,0.7133,3.6467,4.4392,0.5433,4.1182,0.0213,0.2113,1.4893,2.2594,3.3814,4.9785,1.175,1.5984,0.9188,0.0003,0.0399,4.2175,0.9412,0.652,0.8604,1.0365,3.0923,0.0003,1.4978,1.2162,1.344,2.6746,0.2086,0.0143,4.7968,3.8334,4.5701,0.2114,0.0059,0.8447,4.1809,0.4233,3.1147,4.4516,0.1321,0.0003,4.3707,1.2557,1.2697,1.3673,0.0005,5.4283,0.3494,2.0344,3.5628,0.3929,1.4092,3.7627,0.844,0.1538,2.1673,2.8393,2.6256,0.7976,2.1276,1.3862,4.8477,6.5144,0.912,0.0002,0.4555,1.1498,4.4078,3.0574,2.5072,1.6758,1.1165,0.0078,3.2778,1.6515,1.0015,0.1699,1.8822,3.6585,0.0774,2.4258,0.1733,0.2885,5.059,2.27,0.7651,2.188,2.5889,2.4447,0.1449,1.556,0.5529,0.1194,0.0003,2.3865,4.0958,0.8512,2.638,5.6657,3.2405,0.1146,0.2824,0.1962,2.2388,1.947,1.9745,0.4277,4.0837,3.893,0.7708,2.6532,5.1992,2.3537,1.7641,0.5094,2.9172,1.019,1.1165,2.8468,0.739,0.3639,1.6398,1.2178,4.2977,1.2798,1.2322,2.0623,5.3216,4.4344,4.0001,1.1271,2.0358,1.011,0.4154,1.4635,1.629,4.8614,2.7025,0.0581,1.9689,1.1253,0.1095,1.2066,4.595,1.1772,4.6096,1.9334,5.8567,5.6819,0.0731,5.3625,6.187,1.6228,3.3472,0.8373,3.6503,4.7141,1.9745,0.1033,0.0003,2.5009,1.3249,5.6149,0.0374,3.9144,0.2189,5.904,1.5971,0.2741,0.8687,0.1049,1.6729,1.2418,1.3591,3.3673,1.5874,2.7077,0.4631,0.3211,1.2294,3.2483,0.2897,1.2019,1.5297,2.9898,3.9469,1.4885,0.1654,0.0002,4.914,1.5589,1.6885,1.5758,0.001,0.0022,0.2212,4.5352,0.0167,6.7151,2.2434,0.6754,0.9004,4.8104,0.9601,4.0644,4.6424,2.7248,0.3747,0.0114,0.7975,0.0002,0.005,0.0009,0.0001,0.686,1.0889,2.835,0.0,4.0568,1.5546,0.61,0.2728,1.8395,0.0013,3.0187,0.7454,1.0212,4.1341,0.0089,1.349,2.7358,2.9121,2.1914,0.6264,0.4422,3.3716,0.1262,0.2419,1.0561,2.0591,0.4425,0.0003,4.2181,0.0014,0.0002,2.796,2.2262,0.2896,0.0024,2.6736,0.0829,0.0001,2.2797,4.1312,2.0578,2.4793,1.0935,4.6926,4.9296,1.9364,2.4149,0.9514,0.9157,3.0785,8.0978,1.6114,3.7889,0.1881,0.1408,3.2085,4.1838,3.9929,2.6001,3.3616,4.3742,3.7363,1.5569,0.1217,2.7434,2.3976,2.1158,0.8148,4.671,0.2053,0.6175,1.5866,0.0021,0.0614,0.1852,0.265,0.435,0.0003,4.0226,0.0037,0.0002,0.0001,0.0001,0.0142]}
{"id":3170,"ended":false,"length":506,"gen_text":"In 2006, Devil's Due Publishing released a comic book adaptation of Killer7, written and drawn by Kinetic Underground staff. The planned 12 @ - @ issue limited series was cancelled after three issues due to the publisher's inability to secure the rights to the original novel, which was written by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto.\n\nThe series is set in a post-cyberpunk version of America following nuclear destruction. The first story takes place four years after the end of the game. The book also features three novellas set between issues four and six, revealing that Takamai has actually been working for the government since the game's beginning. In the novella \"Fade To Black,\" Kiyoshi's father is executed by the government, with Fumio taking his place as a private contractor to help deal with the consequences of the chaos. In another novella, \"Ragyo\", an ancient martial art known as \"The Beast Fist\" and the most feared weapon of its time, known as \"Daikatana,\" resurfaces after centuries of being kept in the hands of the government. This novella also includes a number of flashback flashbacks to characters that appear later in the story, like Takamai, his father, and Kiyoshi's uncle.\n\nIn the series' seventh installment, \"Daikatana,\" two different groups are fighting over the Daikatana, a \"weapon of unknown origin\" used by the samurai who had used it decades ago. In the latter installment, a group of rebels led by Yashiro are also attempting to seize the Daikatana, and are led by a character named Hida, a descendant of the Hida clan, which is a rival to Daikatana's creator. The series is also told from the point of view of Hida, a former member of a rival clan that became a follower of Takamai, where he learns that Takamai had been killing criminals on purpose, and had been secretly using the Daikatana in order to maintain his own power with Takamai's death.\n\nThe story will be presented in a series of short comics, which will be released on an irregular basis on the KillHouse web site and digital platforms (such as Kindle, Nook, iBooks, Google Play, and iTunes) in Japan.

{"id":2046,"ended":false,"length":453,"gen_text":"In all versions, Khandoba returns to Jejuri with his new wife and faces the wrath of Mhalsa. Many songs tell about the confrontations of Mhalsa and Banai. In some songs, Mhalsa has lost his daughter in Jejuri to Khandoba. During the final scene of the film when Khandoba and Khaanaan are standing in front of the sacred stone, it is Mhala's body that is lying on the stone.\n\nThere are also some variations and remix of the movie.\n\nIn the second version, it is Mhala that gets thrown away but Mhali saves herself by turning into a tree. On the other hand, in the version that follows, he throws her on the stone and Mhali gets saved with a branch. This version is an homage to the original by Mihlata, which shows Mhala getting away with Banai's advice.\n\nIn the sequel, it is Mhala, who got rescued by Khaanaan, and there is no change in the story.\n\nIn the third version of the movie, it is Mhala, who rescued Mhara from Khandoba. This version depicts some new details, like Mhara getting a new life when Khaanaan saves her. The tree-like characters of the movie, like Banai and Khandoba, are now replaced by other kinds of characters. At the end of the movie, Mhala had a baby girl who is named after Hargobind in Gujarati script. The two are called Mhara and Hargobind, and like in previous versions, Mhali shows no change during the film.\n\nIn the last version the film is completely different from previous versions, as in this version Mhala is the savior of Jejuri in the form of a tree. She is then killed by Khandoba. No change in the movie is seen. Mhala, however, was not killed at the end of the film but she is killed by Khaanaan. And this is the reason for the fact that she did not show change at the end of the movie.\n\nIn the final film, Mhala appears as a woman in her early 30's. She has a daughter, called Madha. He is portrayed with a beard and mustache. There is no change in the previous storylines, yet Madha has the same name as her father. They now reside in Jejuri together.\n\nP.S: The story, songs and characters in the movie are based on this epic Mahabharata.\n\nReference Links:\n\nMahabharata \u2013 Wikipedia\n\nMahabharata \u2013 Wikipedia\n\nMahabharata \u2013 IMDB","token_len":576,"entropy":[5.518,7.618,1.5897,7.5331,7.4637,5.0758,6.9084,1.2031,8.6265,4.3221,1.6886,2.8925,2.6093,4.035,3.2805,1.8283,9.2475,1.5228,3.3536,0.0099,5.7043,6.8572,8.8462,1.3854,7.1421,6.135,6.0314,3.756,1.2985,9.8634,0.0194,3.2373,3.2867,0.0326,0.0427,0.3787,8.3358,5.9196,2.0378,2.2317,3.386,1.9581,0.3722,1.7742,0.01,0.0309,3.4425,4.1134,0.5013,5.2502,2.6046,2.1667,0.006,0.0045,4.6361,0.5747,0.0015,0.0002,0.8144,5.7524,0.8616,3.0469,3.7475,0.8606,0.4723,0.73,3.9219,1.2769,0.0019,0.0003,2.3111,3.7217,5.7413,3.5798,3.0547,1.1031,3.8508,1.8323,0.7211,0.0077,0.8794,5.6196,3.7892,1.0336,2.9024,0.4861,2.2674,0.0292,2.9891,2.9673,4.9138,0.794,0.4955,1.9476,0.7663,0.1599,1.1651,0.6165,1.3342,0.0054,4.5098,0.7217,2.5002,2.2331,4.4299,4.7915,4.8631,4.475,0.7876,5.6656,2.146,3.0234,0.0001,2.464,1.3758,5.1014,0.8582,0.5893,4.0837,0.4626,2.4319,0.322,0.2991,3.2932,4.0023,5.3482,3.1354,5.1079,3.3687,0.2559,4.1159,5.3485,3.6514,1.5932,4.9692,0.4517,0.4257,3.3816,0.5084,5.9315,0.5476,1.1921,0.0498,0.1216,0.6205,0.1833,3.5027,2.5075,4.3673,1.7084,5.2046,3.2723,0.7257,4.1994,0.3362,2.314,1.5516,3.4021,0.0723,0.4935,3.1491,2.0766,5.973,2.1242,4.857,0.5541,3.4926,0.5829,1.1111,5.7229,3.8765,0.0701,0.6518,3.1747,4.7965,4.3019,2.6519,6.6627,4.8518,3.0861,1.7331,4.0774,1.2822,0.0761,0.2791,3.356,6.1198,2.2599,2.5744,0.0137,1.8373,5.5271,0.7084,0.4163,0.0002,1.0069,0.3168,5.307,0.4582,2.4356,0.1364,1.1583,0.1039,0.4472,3.5352,1.1795,5.794,3.5984,0.4689,1.7333,1.0603,0.0051,0.0043,1.9875,1.8962,6.0387,0.5717,0.8642,5.298,0.305,0.5059,2.1113,0.3599,0.5673,0.0002,1.1745,0.2759,1.0881,0.1255,3.7252,0.1519,0.5414,0.0969,1.8085,0.076,0.7596,0.0673,0.2617,2.5229,0.1651,4.752,2.6761,0.351,4.6839,1.6555,3.3383,0.1158,0.0033,1.0993,2.7484,0.2824,3.9929,5.9161,5.0088,3.912,2.3811,1.4746,1.2634,0.0577,2.2349,2.754,3.2323,1.8242,4.0806,4.7092,2.764,0.5508,0.002,0.003,2.3993,0.2763,0.7393,2.9135,4.2757,2.9353,0.7834,5.0412,2.4023,0.8341,2.302,3.0704,2.857,1.8564,0.008,0.7307,0.599,0.1997,0.0015,0.3454,0.8889,3.1877,2.2447,0.2249,4.9627,4.4674,0.0427,1.9253,0.786,5.8166,0.3724,0.3165,0.5015,0.0467,0.4311,0.0679,1.2482,0.0929,0.4712,5.7213,1.9244,2.3557,1.8881,2.8105,1.4938,1.1128,1.4465,6.4023,4.2005,1.9891,0.0847,4.4014,6.3334,0.0072,4.9676,0.354,2.7577,5.508,2.4686,3.6315,2.9725,0.6263,1.9514,0.4804,1.4141,0.1658,0.0504,0.0089,2.6063,1.5725,6.2655,1.8012,6.0926,0.3026,0.3138,1.5956,0.0479,3.039,5.4442,4.0313,2.7211,5.2945,0.1201,2.4208,0.2762,0.4709,0.0002,0.8629,0.1547,4.353,0.211,6.1815,3.2827,1.7588,3.246,0.6579,1.6001,3.573,0.5167,2.2708,2.1671,3.4731,0.9948,0.2314,1.5156,0.0667,0.5163,1.503,2.434,5.7649,0.3912,1.542,0.0039,0.004,4.822,0.86,3.5529,0.0043,0.3781,0.4161,0.5454,2.1924,1.4172,3.7725,2.6818,0.1997,0.9692,0.1434,0.0014,1.3311,6.2954,1.9538,0.7762,0.378,3.6616,0.913,1.6523,1.5082,4.8059,0.1391,0.7031,3.1568,2.1699,0.0574,3.4421,2.4746,1.6757,3.6504,0.7405,0.2075,0.3274,0.0881,0.9346,2.9607,2.0018,1.3656,3.2088,0.9088,0.7131,3.1748,0.0027,0.0025,1.264,6.1,2.9444,1.2156,0.8383,2.4893,2.7827,0.591,5.2248,0.0561,3.3168,4.3467,0.0392,2.6874,3.624,2.319,0.1409,0.0659,0.2301,0.062,0.8738,0.2966,0.5532,0.0002,1.7558,0.5202,3.4229,3.863,0.4806,1.3922,0.0554,0.4134,4.3551,1.7031,0.4021,3.303,1.5461,2.2653,2.6924,1.9205,1.1935,1.1248,0.7425,1.9659,1.216,2.1998,2.0633,3.673,5.1821,3.4562,1.064,5.2529,0.9665,4.2443,3.9548,1.0584,1.8365,1.2097,4.309,0.7095,3.8409,0.4571,0.7069,0.2957,0.1175,0.3679,6.9701,7.1085,2.315,6.4318,2.9191,0.024,2.3461,3.9986,0.8714,1.1897,0.3633,1.7441,1.7599,0.567,5.6766,5.5185,4.6957,0.3097,2.2579,0.0125,0.0105,4.1743,0.4526,1.0077,0.0002,5.4235,2.8999,0.4058,1.6161,2.0626,3.5657,5.1685,3.662,0.5841,1.9087,2.4198,0.8593,1.3823,0.8481,1.2641,0.0627,6.54,3.9815,3.9562,0.1055,0.0043,0.0488,1.3656,1.2495,0.0001,5.3153,4.589,0.4385,0.4243,0.0002,2.2712,0.0215,0.0068,0.0775,2.6977,0.5525,0.3642,0.0002,1.3849,0.0172,0.0078,0.0575,1.0752,1.2691,0.3211,0.0002,1.236,0.0174,0.012,0.0489,0.739,3.2856,0.2744]}
{"id":1574,"ended":true,"length":555,"gen_text":"A tropical wave moved off the northwest coast of Africa on June 5. It continued westward across the tropical North Atlantic and Caribbean Sea without significant development. The wave entered the northeastern Pacific Ocean where it has since dissipated. The current state of the tropical wave is currently undecided because of the unsettled weather and currents in the northern Pacific Ocean.\nAn interesting article about the potential for a cyclone in the near future has been written over at Yahoo News. In this article, author Peter J. Hart notes that a tropical cyclone named \"Aurelia\" is currently on track for landfall in the southern Leeward Islands. The island of Vieques has been identified as the most likely potential landfalling point because it lies near the track of \"Aurelia.\" Hurricane watches are available through the National Hurricane Center now.\nWith tropical cyclone activity increasing in the Atlantic, it is probably safe to say that the days of relatively large Atlantic hurricanes are numbered. The National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration's Current Weather Satellite, or CFS, model currently predicts the possibility for a second storm to develop during the second half of September. This second storm would not be any stronger than \"Aurelia,\" so Hurricane watches and warnings will not last too long. However, it is worth noting that CFS model forecasts are the predictions of one model. When several different models are run (such as with the latest EHRP-6), predictions often differ substantially. So the best way to find out is to monitor the track of the storm at any given time. Keep in mind that the CFS is a model only that can look at the atmosphere and storm environment at local and regional scales. It has very little ability to assess the storm intensity and track at a larger scale. In other words, it is not a long distance forecast at the National Weather Service level. However, we can take a look at how this model is able to forecast an extremely intense storm. At this time, the CFS model is predicting the storm to take its eye out south into the Gulf of Mexico and move northwest through the Caribbean Sea. This will lead to a surge near or in the southeastern Bahamas and, through the month of October at least, a few large waves will break ashore along the northern Gulf coast of the United States.\nFinally, you may have noticed some interest in hurricane alerts being issued for the northern Gulf Coast of the United States. This is primarily due to a lack of data for the storm over the past three days. The hurricane warnings will be issued beginning Friday.

{"id":3918,"ended":true,"length":559,"gen_text":"She is one of the foundational works of fantasy literature, coming around the time of The Princess and the Goblin ( 1858 ) by George MacDonald, William Morris'The Wood Beyond the World'(1853) and Lord of the Rings (1955).\n\nThe story is set in a mysterious kingdom where the king and his court seem to be a lot more powerful than a lot of people might think. She has been chosen as queen due to her beauty and great wisdom and thus she is a target for the king and his retainers. Her husband is also important and seems to be a threat to the king, but he is kept away from the action by his mother.\n\nI could have said something about the history of dragons since this is a children's book but I will leave it for others reading it later on. As a young girl I can remember wanting dragons to be huge and scary like this but I am sure adults can remember that when the dragon is shown and explained, it will be very, very real. The book contains some magic and dragons but it is so fantastical that it won't keep anyone awake. I imagine most adults can also understand and appreciate the characters.\n\nI found the story to be too short, but it is short enough to keep you entertained while reading through the beginning to end. I did find it interesting that the two different groups are the same age:\n\nThe princess had been chosen because she was the fairest and youngest of all the princesses; yet the other prince was a prince of the castle. The two groups lived in the same kingdom but the king seemed to have more influence over them than the princess did. It was very strange that neither the princess, nor the prince would go to the king for help and their mother had told them never to go at all. That was a very young age to be learning about the world and finding out what is important in it. All that young girls growing up need is someone to believe in and I found I could relate to the younger girls in this book, and with the prince, who may be just a little too young. The way the two groups got along, it was obvious that the one princess would die and the prince would inherit her power. In a very short time I was also looking forward to reading a whole other book written by this author. When you get past those first few paragraphs I was hooked.\n\nI just wanted to say that I absolutely loved the story of Prince Lora, the Dragon in this wonderful children book. I will certainly be reading more by this author.\n\nFor people who are looking for an educational book for younger children, I would recommend this one. It really makes a great introduction into fantasy without having to have experience with any books that are not fantasy. I think this could become a great introduction to the world of dragons.","token_len":580,"entropy":[3.3108,3.9727,0.1134,0.6432,10.6631,6.4052,0.8059,7.5527,1.4252,1.0225,7.4474,6.5057,1.3567,1.6347,0.7065,2.2053,4.9073,1.6799,0.0612,0.2582,2.5075,10.3532,4.5355,1.5361,3.6499,4.5406,0.1454,1.3057,5.9441,0.3991,1.7613,9.4587,7.5898,5.8382,0.0296,0.7458,7.7045,4.2048,0.3634,4.0948,0.6321,0.4215,3.65,0.6432,0.0229,0.0895,0.6261,0.115,2.4072,0.7754,1.9738,0.1241,2.1756,2.9063,1.4329,0.8152,0.2978,0.8248,5.6799,3.2807,2.0066,1.6806,3.1533,2.2453,1.26,1.5153,5.1594,0.3683,0.9344,3.9462,4.4487,1.2172,2.899,0.253,5.6199,1.9951,0.0082,1.0652,3.7598,0.9027,0.3258,4.8646,2.6066,2.4465,5.3636,1.4975,3.2725,4.5396,0.0174,0.2181,0.8103,0.7756,4.8558,2.8299,2.4665,6.139,1.9923,1.0955,3.677,3.7699,0.5138,1.5852,1.5426,1.9994,0.1908,5.8902,0.0038,0.4918,3.2789,3.7575,1.3369,2.7581,4.5725,1.9438,5.3907,0.1472,0.7653,2.0148,3.945,0.6321,0.4578,0.2068,1.7818,1.0375,1.8209,0.8309,4.4476,2.9476,0.2531,0.577,2.2766,1.2893,0.7116,3.2012,0.8343,0.973,0.0002,3.7989,5.0857,3.0835,4.6586,3.2467,0.7888,0.9502,5.2152,0.2104,5.8311,5.5266,1.4208,0.6682,1.1319,5.1141,0.0538,0.5122,1.9927,1.0306,2.4774,1.422,1.7251,2.2459,3.3704,8.1227,2.0987,5.1805,1.6087,0.6253,4.7015,2.0866,3.0878,1.0562,0.9203,5.0888,1.0564,4.2922,4.0993,1.9302,1.059,4.9224,0.6663,1.4919,3.1779,5.2886,3.2279,1.5792,2.8366,2.4286,5.4068,2.4122,3.1236,2.7241,3.6956,2.6793,3.2723,2.64,4.3956,5.3899,4.4169,2.3216,0.8157,4.5258,0.7563,3.41,3.7359,0.0176,5.7195,0.7336,2.6573,2.5586,4.9075,2.7124,4.1789,1.3484,3.4255,2.3454,1.3764,0.533,4.7993,4.1045,0.0227,0.7531,0.8332,4.9499,0.0026,5.3355,3.2538,2.8416,0.977,2.4103,5.5367,3.4906,2.0555,2.91,4.5284,3.0226,3.2544,2.0388,1.0649,5.1342,2.1694,0.7083,0.0001,2.0575,3.7021,1.0214,1.6336,1.3482,0.0455,5.9536,2.1631,1.958,1.6635,1.9526,1.2244,3.6829,0.7836,1.1995,2.3931,1.5479,2.0043,2.963,1.4142,4.4883,1.5218,3.954,4.4032,1.216,0.5724,1.6014,3.1704,1.9533,1.2926,2.336,0.844,1.0269,5.2582,5.0424,4.0033,3.7038,3.3352,3.2045,2.5286,4.1399,3.8449,0.0002,1.8565,3.2942,4.6121,1.5187,3.7135,2.0025,0.5985,0.245,1.3619,1.4045,0.0011,1.4601,4.1513,0.781,1.1097,0.3782,0.9204,0.0089,2.9941,4.7223,2.6232,3.803,5.0162,0.8594,2.5966,2.1095,0.6222,1.5772,5.3629,2.3411,2.1493,2.8437,1.3508,4.5,0.6979,1.1617,0.2559,1.7671,2.4959,2.0242,2.7818,4.8172,0.2957,1.4905,1.6851,3.0261,0.8316,2.3206,1.08,0.7763,0.5997,2.5039,0.3212,3.7135,0.6656,4.6432,1.7911,2.1459,5.1676,1.281,0.5307,3.2475,0.4565,0.2819,0.8577,3.1483,3.892,0.9426,0.5735,1.1133,1.4126,0.7424,3.5304,5.4143,2.3246,2.1654,2.2349,0.1765,2.4938,0.0146,2.0703,5.5693,0.0586,0.3317,5.3689,0.9184,2.4519,2.0728,4.9411,0.3042,1.8786,0.8901,2.988,1.4859,1.5575,0.5395,0.9522,4.5783,0.5742,1.9826,2.5952,2.3286,1.721,0.6437,0.3419,6.3522,3.1825,5.1758,1.6968,6.068,0.0088,2.7234,0.7508,3.1383,0.1771,4.0383,0.0113,0.7939,3.6782,2.4782,5.1214,1.8125,1.1361,0.1878,1.0691,5.3043,2.9421,1.747,1.1025,0.6099,3.0136,3.43,5.9832,1.0863,3.6169,2.0933,2.4997,5.4376,1.3667,4.1033,1.0562,0.6329,1.8784,1.3752,1.9659,2.916,4.6985,1.1929,2.4422,0.391,4.5937,0.5574,3.048,3.4692,0.8564,3.6419,0.5423,1.8933,4.4318,4.7793,2.5846,5.5461,2.3277,0.7988,1.829,0.215,1.8109,0.995,3.6295,0.7895,4.4147,2.1555,3.161,1.381,0.5291,3.7242,2.1557,4.3448,4.8867,0.128,0.0167,3.2111,3.2852,5.5621,2.1106,0.4084,4.6476,0.1399,2.5185,0.1812,0.6892,6.4531,3.1954,2.8406,3.906,5.6298,1.6235,0.9974,3.8748,2.4283,2.3591,2.0783,0.7452,0.503,0.0001,1.5978,5.2478,2.5164,0.0937,1.6109,0.8913,1.0394,4.4699,0.4247,1.594,2.6505,2.0095,4.7665,3.0125,5.8326,2.0869,2.1268,3.4193,4.2412,0.8418,4.8383,1.9975,5.1936,0.3446,1.1408,2.9859,3.5087,0.3602,1.0698,0.9747,2.048,1.2232,0.2064,0.8287,1.226,0.0002,4.6579,5.9386,0.6189,1.4406,1.8242,0.0866,2.9361,5.2005,0.6873,1.7849,2.1044,0.4678,0.8523,1.2124,1.0853,0.8797,0.4008,1.4176,0.5561,1.897,5.293,4.2314,2.2473,1.3781,2.142,2.2755,1.6617,6.5399,2.119,0.071,2.5272,5.6393,0.9851,3.483,3.9482,2.5344,1.5277,3.0431,0.8848,0.2817,1.9081,2.6381,1.6568,4.3655,5.4257,0.3709,1.2875,2.3658,0.8603,1.8843,0.6724,0.4888,1.7954,1.8498]}
{"id":1243,"ended":true,"length":539,"gen_text":"On September 4, 2011, the Broncos placed Minor on injured reserve. They waived him on October 10. In November 2011, he was `` charged with possession of marijuana with intent to deliver and criminal possession of drug paraphernalia.'' ( The Associated Press, 6\/14\/2011) In November 2012, he was arrested for violating his probation to the 2010 season. (The Denver Post, 12\/11\/2012) On August 13, 2014, Minor was arrested and charged with aggravated assault following an argument with a woman. He was later released on a $1,000 bond. (Fox 31, 8\/13\/2014) On January 4, 2015, Minor posted a $2,000 bond on a misdemeanor domestic violence charge. (The Denver Post, 2\/10\/2015) On March 13, 2015, Minor was again arrested for battery while in the possession of a controlled substance. (The Denver Post, 3\/13\/2015)\n\nMinor and the Broncos were involved in an ugly, public feud in 2011 following the arrest of a Broncos assistant, Anthony Lynn during the second game of a playoff game. Lynn was suspended for the Broncos' next game, and Minor claimed he was a victim of bullying from Lynn. The fight ended with Lynn spitting on minor, but the case was dropped due to lack of evidence.\n\nThe incident was so public, the Broncos allowed Minor to speak at the game. At the conclusion of the game, Minor said: ``If we're going to lose the division [to Kansas City], I want [Lynn] fired.'' Broncos owner Pat Bowlen had an exchange with Lynn and threatened to fire him, which caused Minor to walk off in protest. The following January Lynn was hired by the Broncos, but Minor still did not appear for the team's mandatory minicamp. He was held in check by a healthy Broncos team that didn't appear to care, and took the final job in Houston with a reputation that led many to expect a big payday.\n\nHowever, after a shaky start, Minor was released when it was revealed that he still owed more than $2m to the Broncos. During his time in Houston he did not play football. Instead, he made numerous TV appearances and signed a deal with CBS Sports. The team later re-signed Minor, but he failed to live up to expectations. He had one season in the NFL with the New York Jets in 2013, where the Texans had to cut him after just three games.\n\nMinor found himself unable to negotiate a new contract with Denver, and he retired in the middle of the 2015 season. The Denver Post reported that Minor was fined $25,000 for his sideline behavior, and the Broncos waived him to clear the way for the Broncos draft pick.\n\nMinor played for the NFL Germany in 2010, but also tried out for the Colts in 2011.","token_len":581,"entropy":[4.6867,3.4641,0.2806,3.7607,0.1344,1.3778,9.1052,4.8301,13.4186,0.2505,1.5246,0.0095,1.423,5.4892,2.8149,0.5532,0.6891,2.0352,3.3272,1.313,3.3644,2.4216,2.0797,0.121,1.8462,0.6875,14.3848,11.5855,0.1516,3.3869,0.0629,1.4256,2.3992,0.1898,0.0074,0.9929,2.0446,5.2595,0.6837,0.0196,2.5902,0.0269,0.0008,0.0001,1.4641,4.3445,7.0685,2.761,0.0007,0.5439,3.4832,0.0434,3.3139,0.0117,3.0964,0.6689,3.6302,3.2529,0.8265,0.0619,1.292,0.3056,0.9215,1.1007,3.8291,1.1076,0.1764,6.7296,2.3859,4.5235,1.6941,0.6239,1.1653,2.4727,0.6032,0.0192,0.0218,2.0017,0.0015,3.333,0.0074,0.3437,0.0531,1.5598,3.2118,3.6386,0.0126,1.6591,0.0774,0.848,0.5097,0.4886,2.088,0.1555,0.0622,4.06,0.5018,4.3992,0.643,2.7188,0.6169,1.0994,2.0011,1.6647,1.8734,0.8275,2.4946,0.8259,0.9065,1.4341,0.2305,2.0917,0.0126,0.3515,0.2517,0.1856,0.2699,4.0836,0.8557,0.2228,0.3338,0.0015,0.7003,0.0112,0.1775,0.0327,1.8114,2.4115,3.3185,0.0061,0.4002,0.0776,0.3177,5.6536,1.3971,1.1241,2.6132,0.0883,1.0011,0.0588,3.1951,1.0905,2.1432,1.4163,0.2906,0.1674,0.4655,0.2495,1.1481,0.6266,0.0411,0.0133,2.8854,0.0009,4.1099,0.0037,0.1248,0.02,1.225,2.3383,3.5961,0.0068,0.2329,0.0354,0.3455,0.6966,4.3821,0.1654,0.9315,4.4536,5.6685,2.0451,2.6644,4.1946,0.0061,0.4268,1.9442,0.0484,0.3221,0.6926,0.5682,0.247,0.0093,0.0116,0.1553,0.0014,0.9324,0.0019,0.0471,0.0166,1.7274,0.0117,2.1097,4.9762,1.5693,0.2521,2.8101,2.0348,0.0164,1.8861,3.8649,3.355,2.2486,2.0173,1.4163,1.872,4.8014,1.2701,5.6984,0.1937,2.6632,1.1827,4.8933,4.1373,5.011,1.4391,6.9845,1.4344,4.9667,2.0356,0.0625,3.1486,2.4688,0.415,0.8083,1.0555,0.8509,2.7055,0.6644,0.6485,2.7413,0.2855,1.5508,0.2144,1.2678,1.3458,1.273,4.4381,1.4211,0.8022,4.3337,0.2649,0.0907,2.9878,2.2002,1.1515,0.8176,1.9473,4.2877,3.3983,0.805,0.6267,5.4074,0.8331,4.8504,1.4245,3.7694,1.4861,5.2091,0.4264,1.777,3.4124,0.0058,1.0844,0.0022,0.0695,0.1523,1.478,0.0002,2.7894,2.9084,1.8928,4.4288,2.3343,1.7021,1.8592,0.6064,5.5806,1.0157,0.1811,3.3041,1.4601,1.1913,5.4085,1.304,4.6231,0.571,3.9772,0.087,0.3031,0.1582,0.0931,1.5043,2.7198,2.3369,2.4164,3.4118,3.3331,2.5905,0.7198,0.0268,3.3859,2.8202,5.0443,4.0725,1.2609,3.1374,0.0029,0.6367,1.0166,1.8112,4.2293,0.3149,0.0152,0.0335,2.0589,0.796,5.1736,2.0,0.0009,0.0002,0.0,4.6564,4.1312,4.5585,0.0895,0.7369,2.9415,3.1214,0.1396,1.1099,0.2539,1.7356,2.6742,2.9967,1.6623,0.0619,3.3476,0.4929,3.6205,1.1178,0.1342,2.3175,2.8609,5.4572,5.4058,0.7051,2.7711,0.5933,0.1991,3.1998,1.818,1.9419,2.1436,3.6389,3.3057,0.014,4.6612,2.9073,1.1785,1.1931,0.6022,4.6432,0.2794,0.0003,0.0064,0.3366,2.4529,1.1235,5.6498,3.6306,4.8184,0.8064,3.7276,4.9316,2.8622,1.303,2.4739,4.9979,0.0009,3.3151,0.4883,1.9447,4.3431,0.784,6.1436,1.9949,5.6489,4.892,2.4797,5.475,1.8383,1.6802,5.076,2.8593,5.1963,2.0272,0.2541,4.6579,1.8294,3.6107,1.3603,0.5495,0.6176,0.0002,3.1301,0.034,2.507,1.8531,4.9184,1.1132,1.0894,0.3898,2.2771,2.2837,5.4151,2.8489,1.59,1.4643,0.7477,0.3536,5.7137,0.3931,3.1722,0.0708,0.0742,2.267,6.7734,1.3767,0.8802,0.4839,0.5613,5.5851,1.1906,1.0432,0.8425,0.0913,2.9358,4.3487,0.718,1.8338,4.0182,1.9678,2.1158,0.5203,0.1634,4.3435,4.7527,4.8676,0.2575,1.2319,5.7122,1.9812,2.2587,0.3999,3.788,1.5269,1.7679,2.9871,4.6206,3.5616,3.3299,0.3256,0.0794,0.9632,2.025,1.1555,1.067,3.5991,0.1229,1.5677,0.0026,0.0072,1.1785,1.0394,1.4877,3.3031,3.1588,2.9587,2.1221,1.6532,0.4098,2.138,0.4395,3.1591,0.4349,0.3913,2.1644,1.401,0.6852,3.1529,5.0542,4.4224,3.0308,2.4202,1.9566,0.1118,1.1371,1.7515,2.2871,0.2942,0.8138,1.1581,0.0002,2.1033,5.5396,1.4411,5.0479,0.004,6.5526,1.0122,0.8326,0.4052,0.4773,4.7009,0.9334,0.6905,2.4181,4.388,1.7292,3.7715,1.7871,0.0021,0.3665,0.9648,0.0893,0.2467,2.8807,3.3149,0.5935,0.6054,0.4321,1.2355,1.7173,4.9268,0.3974,2.6302,0.0354,0.0161,0.7729,1.2941,5.3556,2.3016,2.1189,0.8896,2.0011,1.3266,4.5354,0.1242,3.6161,1.9054,2.6518,1.7654,0.028,2.9739,3.405,4.5202,0.2788,1.9144,1.1189,0.0002,2.3108,2.8863,2.0227,0.5729,3.9843,6.3067,2.6525,2.5359,0.9442,1.323,5.6419,4.7633,1.6393,0.1687,0.2353,5.0583,1.1704,0.8916,0.447]}
{"id":2517,"ended":true,"length":543,"gen_text":"The first Ancient Hawaiians to arrive on Hawaii island lived along the shores, where food and water were plentiful. Flightless birds that had previously known no predators became a staple food source. Other food items were turtle eggs and sea cucumbers. But these sources of food could not last in the long term. Soon after the first immigrants arrived, the Hawaiian economy collapsed.\n\nIt took a long time until other people showed up.\n\nIn 1769, a group of English and Dutch explorers landed at Pukapuka on the main island of Hawaii. They established trading posts, named for their leader, Francis Scott Key, who was a naturalist from England. The posts were set up in various locations on the main island for trading items and food.\n\nThe islands got more crowded over time. In 1840, the Hawaiian Society was established to establish rules concerning land ownership, fishing and other economic matters. These posts became an easy place for people to make money. Also, the new laws were often broken and, as there were so few people living north of Hilo, the island got crowded with people from the south. This caused problems with food and water, as well as housing supplies.\n\nHawaii was a very rural country. Most people lived in small village villages or in wooden huts, where they raised sheep, pigs and chickens. The farms had two fields, with livestock kept there on these areas, sometimes with their owners coming every fall to go hunting and eating the animals.\n\nBy 1900, Hilo was a bustling city with a population that included many foreigners, European and Asian. The population rose steadily during this time. By 1920, Hilo had a population of over 150,000, including nearly 20,000 foreigners. During this time, Hawaiian tourism grew in response to increasing popularity of Honolulu and Hilo as a place to stay.\n\nThis increased popularity of Hilo is the first part of the story. The second part of the story is about the islands' economic growth.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2001, Honolulu's population grew by 8%, and Hilo's by 9%. This is an almost entirely non-local population, coming not from the south at all.\n\nOn March 23, 1981, the city of Hilo proposed to sell its land area, known as the Hawaii Center. The city purchased the land for $13 million, and the Honolulu Economic Commission accepted the offer. The city has the option to purchase 10 city blocks of land to expand Honolulu International Airport.\n\nIn 1989, the land sale was approved by Honolulu's city council, though not yet in effect. Many of the city's current residents were only children when this land was acquired. If they were dead by the time it was sold, they could still be living on it. After all, this is Hawaii, so that's how much your children eat.","token_len":582,"entropy":[4.145,12.5136,10.1067,0.2364,2.9343,1.9832,1.2326,2.4819,4.5967,4.5165,4.2611,0.1646,2.9821,3.2769,2.8407,6.8954,2.1783,1.2811,0.7191,0.7747,0.3926,12.3036,1.2661,0.2888,4.2246,2.8669,4.9528,7.3287,0.6636,4.6853,4.0973,2.3085,2.7156,2.3878,0.5095,1.4351,5.1029,3.3016,2.5113,1.7842,6.9298,1.2135,1.212,3.4334,1.6063,0.1617,0.5656,4.873,3.6557,5.0436,1.2658,0.383,3.5769,0.4999,2.7977,3.8879,0.5503,2.5579,0.8651,1.1286,4.2516,1.6206,1.0072,0.7121,4.5517,0.2675,0.2382,1.1632,3.2207,4.5802,1.8117,0.669,1.698,0.0125,4.2728,2.3261,2.1567,1.6209,0.1773,5.0292,4.3508,2.6373,3.2714,0.248,1.7369,3.2298,0.0002,2.8216,2.7937,2.5379,0.2051,1.74,2.1968,0.0524,3.7855,2.8338,2.0188,2.0784,1.5946,2.2493,4.5628,2.3438,1.162,0.0565,2.4948,0.6602,4.9913,0.2115,0.6936,0.3408,0.3529,1.0446,4.9273,2.4669,0.111,1.7588,5.0253,3.2089,1.6393,2.8863,0.4847,4.6451,3.2318,0.1041,0.966,1.8847,1.4225,2.0286,4.0999,0.3939,4.4332,0.8084,0.2962,2.11,5.9935,1.1251,4.7789,0.148,2.0096,4.1321,1.1213,2.1074,0.1323,1.3453,0.1343,5.3569,3.0366,6.2769,1.8524,3.3955,0.3999,1.0527,0.0002,1.7681,3.9004,5.6466,2.859,1.9092,3.1082,0.5528,0.7534,2.341,4.2968,0.0937,1.3155,3.1589,6.4736,2.1274,1.6467,1.3938,4.5971,3.2758,6.2239,2.1776,0.8752,1.3205,2.804,1.8346,1.9153,3.3949,2.169,0.1278,4.4478,5.7785,2.7131,4.9132,5.2795,1.4852,0.6301,1.5909,0.1319,3.3984,0.5489,0.8311,6.8237,0.1638,1.3437,4.2979,3.9466,3.0192,4.4507,4.5823,2.4047,4.7278,1.5596,6.1794,0.5125,2.4485,1.8063,1.0572,2.5075,8.9237,0.0421,3.8173,0.0334,0.2326,1.7594,3.4879,3.813,1.6547,2.7993,1.1263,1.2838,1.8448,0.5818,0.3693,3.5294,2.4919,2.5361,1.4786,2.5643,1.0536,0.5236,1.9745,2.1616,0.9246,0.0344,5.599,7.1667,0.2303,0.4744,0.0002,3.7188,0.6351,1.9596,2.3137,2.8815,5.4686,3.9958,1.5071,2.9415,0.63,0.7176,0.621,1.5561,4.8882,2.9983,2.7948,2.1018,4.9873,0.5932,0.0013,2.4904,3.0601,0.5112,2.5974,3.6208,0.5295,1.0092,0.9923,0.8539,0.2639,2.1183,5.4788,2.7582,5.1025,3.4761,1.3949,2.1197,5.0075,2.7094,3.7939,4.3245,6.1157,5.9592,2.9599,5.5604,2.4106,2.5045,2.6168,4.6935,4.0779,7.4944,0.578,6.1065,1.9853,2.5491,4.5098,1.2681,1.1572,0.2359,1.1331,0.0002,3.3214,3.1838,0.09,6.252,0.0198,1.2428,1.7574,2.9176,1.0112,1.3502,1.3933,0.2667,3.2231,3.3655,1.8875,3.1541,1.486,5.883,1.0373,1.6198,0.4318,1.7628,1.851,4.8368,3.4989,3.7469,1.6633,0.4213,1.2042,2.1122,2.3786,0.0907,2.0447,0.0032,0.5254,0.7316,0.0655,0.0711,2.1954,4.5065,0.0094,0.0048,2.0944,3.0447,3.6762,2.9424,0.0274,0.0036,2.5112,0.3287,4.6666,0.8237,0.2286,0.1078,4.8556,4.5753,2.5134,3.9084,3.3414,0.0481,3.9323,4.3354,0.6371,5.6763,1.9931,4.0296,0.024,1.6171,1.4902,2.5469,0.1833,3.5145,0.4426,0.5362,0.0002,4.2168,3.5207,2.4228,2.9673,1.5102,0.0028,4.6834,3.3327,3.6127,4.2644,0.0463,0.5151,0.8548,0.5803,1.1324,0.2412,0.0919,1.2458,0.1457,0.0456,0.6064,2.0411,0.7943,5.3066,0.7696,2.8837,3.3017,0.9238,0.7992,0.0002,4.6028,6.2507,0.247,5.9171,0.0396,4.3719,1.6788,0.3876,0.8094,0.8537,4.0998,3.53,1.991,1.0694,0.0033,0.2667,1.4907,3.1311,0.2978,1.8849,2.4324,3.2054,4.7581,4.6544,4.2871,0.0339,2.673,0.6619,1.9303,4.4726,4.4885,0.2065,1.5451,3.5243,5.091,0.0074,1.87,1.8031,0.0002,5.4726,4.3505,3.1431,0.0732,4.9082,0.0459,1.1369,3.5839,0.5308,0.9289,0.005,5.3513,2.194,3.2611,2.0386,2.7621,6.3093,2.7919,4.2652,0.0605,0.4743,5.2874,4.1001,2.5815,1.0197,1.687,5.1052,0.8936,0.7487,1.6349,0.1906,4.5745,0.8671,1.4365,1.3079,2.0631,3.7563,3.7028,7.8397,5.1933,0.3339,1.1705,0.5237,1.1881,1.4203,4.2969,4.284,1.1026,0.4381,1.5458,7.1196,6.9474,1.1739,2.373,0.5568,3.348,1.5181,3.9401,1.5456,0.0312,0.6661,0.8686,0.0002,2.1293,4.0697,0.0483,0.6986,5.3687,3.3742,0.8143,0.9046,0.7111,4.0224,2.0764,2.8234,0.024,1.191,4.9608,3.5277,4.6243,4.1262,1.7739,0.1486,6.0725,2.4964,0.1829,2.6644,0.1976,3.7488,0.991,1.5385,5.7228,2.1799,0.5764,2.0761,1.0009,0.6137,2.5817,0.4146,5.6653,3.0454,1.5748,6.2621,1.4966,1.3589,0.0504,3.3311,0.3097,0.5314,0.1015,1.5025,2.5468,2.9447,1.4881,4.5359,0.4225,1.6094,0.6902,5.5931,2.511,0.025,3.0081,1.3947,1.2819,1.1056,2.5928,4.42,1.1036,2.377,4.6969,5.5829,2.7521,6.5501,0.5751]}
{"id":1251,"ended":false,"length":530,"gen_text":"While Leigh made Streetcar in 1951, Olivier joined her in Hollywood to film Carrie, based on the controversial novel Sister Carrie ; although the film was plagued by troubles, Olivier received warm reviews and won an Oscar in the role of the main lead. During the 1950s he made films in Paris, Australia and London, although never winning the Academy Award. Olivier's major work during this period was the classic The Rose Tattoo (1955). Olivier also had a successful career as a producer of television.\n\nHe also produced the BBC's TV series King Lear (1974), King Solomon's Mines (1978), The Family Story (1984), and The Queen (1991).\n\nIn the US, he had a hugely successful career as a producer of film, with classics such as The Godfather trilogy (1972\u20131976), Apocalypse Now (1979), and Casablanca (1942); he also edited some of the biggest movies of its time: John Ford's Stagecoach and John Wayne's On the Waterfront, and directed the Oscar winning film A Streetcar Named Desire (1951). The Oscar won for Best Picture went to Francis Ford Coppola for Apocalypse Now. In 1985, Olivier worked on a film, The Age of Innocence, based on the novel by Virginia Woolf. The film was a hugely successful effort and won Olivier his first Academy Award for Best Director. He had another major success with Mel Gibson's blockbuster The Patriot, starring Clint Eastwood. Olivier's next film was Mel Gibson's Lethal Weapon 4 in 1989. In 1991, Olivier made the American film A River Runs Through It, which proved to be extremely popular, and he received an Academy Award nomination for it. In 1994, he made the BBC film The White Queen, based on the novel by Emma Donoghue; at the time, the film was the biggest grossing film in British movie history. The film is notorious for being extremely misogynistic; it won numerous awards for its depiction of the relationship between Princess Margaret (Halle Berry) and Charles (Jeremy Irons). The film was critically acclaimed, but was widely ignored in its initial theatrical run.

The following equation is thus equivalent to\n\nThis simple extension of the exponential rule for real exponents to positive exponents allows us to prove what might have seemed paradoxical at first: it is easy to prove the inverse square law for negative exponents. On the other hand, the inverse square law is not provable for positive exponents. That is, the second derivative of such a function will be an infinite series, because we will know what b' is precisely at x = b. But the second derivative of any linear function (say, a function that is the reciprocal of itself and is constant in time) satisfies the inverse square law.\n\nBut the equation\n\nis a trivial example of the second derivative of a linear function. Indeed, given any linear function f and a polynomial p(x), the real number such that p(x) = f(p(x)) can be defined using the series\n\nThis series satisfies the inverse square law (the right hand side is known as the Hessian), while the left hand side is the series\n\nThe second derivative is bounded by, where the Hessian has a positive eigenvalue. The two series are orthogonal, that is,, while the series for a polynomial whose eigenvalue has a positive eigenvalue satisfies, by definition, the inverse square law. In other words, the second derivatives are bounded by an upper bound, a fact which is in very sharp contrast to conventional analytic trigonometry.\n\nThis form of the inverse square law for positive exponents was well known in the history of trigonometry. The first rigorous application of this form to polynomials was given by Pierre-Louis Lagrange in 1700. Other important contributions to the derivation of the inverse square law at positive exponents were made by David Gauss and Pierre Brouwer (Gauss 1799; Brouwer 1813) and Robert Heilin (Heilin 1836); however, they are important only for the case of a real number that is relatively prime; their work lies beyond the scope of this article.\n\nMore recently, several non-trivial examples for the inverse square law for positive exponents have been investigated. In the context of a finite group, this law is known as the Galois property (cf. Gaussian theorem and Galois theory). Other forms of the inverse square law for positive exponents also have analogs in algebraic geometry.","token_len":582,"entropy":[7.0658,11.5627,2.8903,0.7147,0.1371,1.0725,0.4719,1.5563,7.522,0.1173,0.7422,1.688,0.5507,0.847,0.1021,0.225,11.5162,0.0126,2.444,1.0559,4.0893,2.5239,0.0195,9.4019,4.4104,2.4313,2.5438,2.9409,2.6567,4.8885,2.0155,0.6268,2.8562,1.9314,10.6519,2.2823,3.457,2.1583,1.9756,0.0046,6.4977,0.1605,1.5098,4.2386,0.2451,1.5947,0.9588,3.597,3.3265,4.0334,1.1941,0.3954,2.3793,3.7877,3.8125,0.4142,5.6801,0.0587,4.4004,3.6866,2.0413,2.5141,1.2701,5.5954,0.659,3.022,5.4364,5.0712,0.2312,1.2874,5.2283,0.2719,0.4696,0.0042,0.3072,2.4868,0.2548,2.5578,4.616,3.5256,2.0254,4.9001,1.5572,0.0397,1.6323,0.0002,2.7726,5.5849,5.6194,0.535,0.4853,3.5339,2.3698,3.1498,1.3982,1.937,0.1291,1.8507,2.2412,3.1156,0.0156,3.7393,1.2415,0.0197,3.4234,5.93,4.8558,2.4172,0.6592,2.4718,0.0145,3.0705,0.1832,0.6768,3.3732,0.4139,3.8307,0.0473,1.1636,2.4085,3.4264,4.3945,0.6755,0.6691,2.5569,0.4386,0.0083,0.848,6.3788,0.1733,0.2771,0.0026,0.0468,1.516,1.5944,0.1241,0.048,1.6132,1.4985,4.4802,0.025,0.7876,1.1497,0.1892,0.0036,0.793,4.868,0.2735,0.2118,2.0275,5.8058,3.0465,0.5018,6.3805,0.2485,0.8651,2.881,1.5591,4.038,0.9824,0.6501,1.6159,4.5071,3.2351,3.7399,5.9968,4.9931,3.0078,0.4757,0.9402,5.367,1.1452,1.7221,0.0636,0.941,1.419,3.4573,1.5687,3.0946,0.0261,0.3574,2.7041,5.4903,0.3122,3.4819,4.4906,0.6343,1.7747,1.9639,2.4257,1.5796,2.9384,5.5204,0.0222,2.3377,4.4851,2.4151,3.3676,1.5664,2.369,0.2525,5.3432,0.3437,0.3361,0.0369,0.0106,1.126,1.3507,0.0002,5.3231,2.0889,4.9311,2.7526,0.0003,1.4097,2.7464,5.2821,3.7782,0.1372,1.0691,3.2905,0.2942,0.5377,0.6064,0.9896,0.0765,1.0553,3.4395,0.0314,4.5247,0.9203,2.2203,0.151,0.6732,2.095,1.4646,5.6525,0.0001,0.0071,1.4064,2.1691,0.2691,0.4945,1.1474,6.1078,3.6936,4.5167,0.0054,1.2375,0.0184,0.1178,0.0763,0.5204,1.0372,0.0805,3.8077,0.1037,0.0284,0.2807,2.4747,0.0811,3.5299,4.7755,0.6279,5.9718,0.8391,0.0003,3.3284,1.2093,3.7605,0.1271,0.1763,0.0313,0.0052,3.6814,3.2303,4.541,1.6053,0.047,0.9255,4.445,0.7625,0.1488,5.7442,0.1187,1.6723,4.4463,0.3512,2.3211,0.1985,0.0035,0.526,3.0013,3.0436,0.3921,0.0003,2.2322,2.9932,0.071,2.1765,4.6922,0.7463,5.3772,6.476,1.9583,4.8838,0.007,3.3062,1.7448,2.8335,5.5066,0.6637,0.1351,0.8382,2.0084,5.3139,0.9053,0.8687,5.3082,0.0162,0.0039,1.2348,4.4329,0.0019,9.7939,4.9951,0.4041,2.6229,2.904,2.8411,1.4724,0.0,0.0012,4.3636,0.7131,0.0046,0.1936,2.7698,0.383,0.4891,0.3356,0.0033,0.0173,2.5402,4.2563,4.8788,1.9619,0.3219,0.3494,0.1182,0.0426,0.0061,0.358,3.2732,1.236,0.0024,0.0286,0.9266,1.4953,3.7279,2.2764,2.6768,0.2157,3.9081,3.5298,0.5534,2.2037,4.2027,4.6756,1.7687,1.2663,4.7774,6.0556,3.6919,0.1523,0.2854,7.2885,4.0462,5.2157,0.0072,0.0247,0.7016,0.5954,0.0002,2.9943,5.4587,0.0566,0.3166,0.7829,0.0266,0.0037,2.6145,1.4076,0.197,0.0075,2.3882,4.9681,0.466,1.4107,0.7755,4.8719,0.0018,2.111,0.0022,0.0056,1.0671,2.2443,2.3411,5.1532,3.0097,0.2473,1.595,2.5458,1.4737,3.5907,0.0,0.0688,0.0002,0.7833,2.4347,0.1679,4.9132,1.2703,2.0896,2.0459,0.0021,0.7139,7.1102,0.7398,5.9576,2.3949,3.5327,0.6147,0.3991,4.5377,0.0197,0.0635,0.4307,0.1029,0.0067,0.0051,6.2115,0.4001,0.1607,0.0286,1.0149,0.3151,0.113,5.2812,5.7783,0.09,1.6424,3.9169,5.3022,1.2005,0.0375,2.6712,3.1171,0.026,1.936,3.873,2.067,0.0662,0.0002,0.0016,0.7695,4.1815,2.4821,0.3987,5.2559,4.5038,0.8012,3.3375,0.2088,0.2106,0.0024,0.0034,0.7085,4.4113,5.5655,3.4161,0.0487,3.1745,2.9504,5.9639,0.5011,1.151,1.2721,3.3638,0.4178,3.435,3.7309,1.8399,2.5553,0.5997,5.5758,0.5907,4.0911,3.8123,1.795,5.9285,2.8685,0.1575,0.0689,0.008,0.0968,0.5919,0.0812,0.4849,0.0002,5.5006,1.4145,0.0831,4.9633,5.6498,0.2517,1.3127,0.0003,0.0005,1.8419,4.0099,1.2182,0.2111,0.009,0.0064,2.227,0.1797,0.1314,0.0014,0.2357,0.0323,4.3499,1.1203,2.344,2.0164,2.8122,0.0017,3.4307,3.5393,3.3513,1.5265,3.8614,0.4925,1.4039,2.6368,0.0918,0.2406,5.8297,0.02,2.4699,2.268,5.2857,0.0965,3.2156,2.2216,2.9299,3.4086,1.0872,0.0062,2.0868,0.3949,5.344,5.1302,0.0739,0.2408,0.0591,0.0057,0.0026,0.6899,0.0984,0.0421,0.0023,4.6465,1.8038,6.3567,1.5656,0.2599,3.8287,0.2259,0.3064,0.9156]}
{"id":4189,"ended":true,"length":541,"gen_text":"Steve Fossett was well known for his world records and adventures in balloons, sailboats, gliders, and powered aircraft. He was an aviator of exceptional breadth of experience. He wanted to find the North Pole in 1910 and was killed by unknown natural causes while attempting to do so in 1911. In 1916 he built a jet powered glider to follow the Arctic Circle in the late summer\/ early fall. He became an expert on glider training and was the first man to fly and land a jet powered glider using a pre-designed and tested flight course. He flew from Los Angeles to Paris and became the first man to fly all the way to the top of the world using a standard airship. While doing so he made a number of aviation firsts, including making the first flight of a glider over long distances by attaching a long length rope to a jet engine to pull away from the ground. It remained the longest free balloon flight for 4 days. His research and publication and his many air craft and aerial stunts, however, made a lasting impact on aviation.\n\nJohn Lindbergh, the famous American aviator, was a pilot for a commercial jet airline and a successful aviator. He was a frequent guest of the Rockefeller's and was known to give tours of their luxurious mansions where he posed for pictures and often became the star of the shows. The Rockefellers became known as the \"Rockefellers of aviation\", as this man built many of the aircraft we now know of. Lindbergh was also an excellent cook and pilot as well, and became an expert on cooking, flying, and human physiology. His book The Spirit of St. Louis (1926), which is a classic in the field of aviator safety and performance is largely credited by many with increasing general awareness of the dangers of flying in the air.\n\nDuring WWI many pilots flew the first high altitude military missions. On June 14, 1916, the Wright brothers flew a plane over England at almost 100,000 feet (see The Sky Is Falling ). During WWI some planes flew over Europe, capturing video of the fighting. During WWI it was common for German pilots to volunteer for the air arm of the Allies, especially after the Treaty of Versailles. Many were sent to service with the famed Flying Tigers. On August 22, 1918 French pilots flew the first non-military mission over the Somme, capturing the now famous photo of the first French soldier to die. On February 24, 1919, the United States Army took off, first by helicopter, then parachute jumping high above Germany in an effort to break the German offensive.\n\nThe first man on the moon was Neil Armstrong of the United States ( see How Do You Get To The Moon? ). Armstrong performed all of these feats without any assistance from any other human being other than God himself.","token_len":583,"entropy":[9.7866,0.678,4.3772,7.1467,1.6063,1.432,0.5859,8.3993,5.1714,2.1638,7.8601,1.428,9.8386,1.5886,6.3682,0.3072,0.5966,5.2339,0.0463,0.6425,0.9774,5.8138,2.4704,0.3037,1.0915,1.0755,2.5708,3.8243,0.0149,3.6486,5.0382,7.2828,2.4701,0.4355,1.6301,1.3609,8.1289,0.1584,5.3178,1.7719,4.8464,0.2749,3.5517,4.7186,1.5126,2.484,5.4492,2.504,6.2204,6.1353,0.0636,2.1648,1.2048,0.5848,0.4832,0.1034,1.6638,2.3082,0.1347,3.2753,3.5516,1.3319,4.4285,1.0701,5.6776,2.2226,1.5177,0.0018,2.7622,6.1403,0.4003,3.4667,0.5763,3.5047,1.908,5.0122,1.2372,4.5317,3.7392,0.1067,0.6286,1.2148,4.6576,3.3543,1.6292,1.4528,3.2259,1.65,5.1947,0.6154,2.494,2.0991,0.7094,3.4562,0.1661,1.0849,5.0208,0.2267,0.9132,1.111,0.9574,0.205,0.0013,5.96,1.1564,5.1135,0.1061,3.3909,3.3334,2.6416,2.3895,4.7379,0.2953,1.0876,2.817,2.7546,5.6176,0.0149,0.165,4.049,2.1606,5.748,0.3271,0.0825,1.2658,0.1174,1.0266,3.9303,0.2607,0.1151,1.0671,0.7259,4.7981,0.0071,0.7354,1.3583,3.4888,0.9015,5.9017,4.1242,0.6152,0.6272,5.3552,3.9106,0.8251,0.5702,3.2631,1.9208,2.8756,0.0019,5.3956,3.2783,0.0047,1.4757,0.4051,4.1149,0.4693,0.2364,2.143,2.3309,0.5428,2.7003,0.0132,2.3252,6.2035,0.1253,3.6173,5.4704,0.9365,5.192,4.062,5.8405,0.2779,1.1949,3.9074,0.3431,3.2115,4.2845,5.6439,0.373,0.4409,1.166,0.6996,4.6567,6.7811,0.5577,1.5327,4.0479,3.066,0.0429,2.3122,5.6185,0.9977,1.0652,3.0806,5.2036,2.0581,5.4719,5.562,1.6893,4.116,4.385,4.0091,1.9142,4.1154,5.4748,3.447,4.7984,0.0412,2.3389,4.7783,1.5683,1.4836,0.2195,1.2287,0.9822,1.3703,0.0135,4.2719,5.1527,1.5142,0.0,2.3756,1.7908,2.0967,2.3845,0.1706,0.0082,0.6703,1.0425,1.9818,3.677,2.6381,2.86,3.6272,4.7867,1.5699,1.9056,1.9256,3.7659,2.1562,0.0081,1.0358,0.726,1.0322,2.0961,5.4528,2.6031,1.1793,1.4241,2.3081,2.6399,0.9656,1.5885,3.0656,1.1663,4.6433,3.9414,0.3745,2.3374,4.8683,2.9374,0.0003,5.3118,0.3198,5.3772,0.4675,1.414,1.7947,5.1842,5.5267,1.6785,3.3594,1.0177,0.5426,4.3966,0.1494,3.8117,2.1689,0.0011,0.0017,0.0012,4.5773,4.3437,1.0628,0.6478,0.7393,0.9185,0.0145,2.2167,0.0016,0.0039,0.1481,2.4245,2.6747,2.8941,5.8091,5.0789,4.8881,3.1582,0.7226,0.3334,1.8126,5.0873,2.0425,2.0922,3.1657,1.8513,2.3411,0.0072,0.0007,1.1352,2.0109,1.855,3.9972,5.658,0.7695,6.1378,4.4035,0.3999,2.6405,1.0893,3.9883,2.5186,1.2332,0.8657,3.8249,2.7379,4.0253,0.3695,0.2594,5.7879,1.196,0.2461,2.3266,3.5001,2.2764,1.1148,0.0111,0.0132,0.0183,0.0014,3.5935,0.4995,3.1866,2.2481,1.8269,2.5298,1.8753,2.8985,1.9007,0.8663,0.5447,0.2695,2.7916,1.1516,4.8021,2.1789,4.5048,3.6174,5.856,1.5413,4.9579,2.3737,1.6552,5.1498,5.6995,1.6388,0.326,0.997,0.786,0.2762,0.4342,2.4654,1.1972,2.0974,0.2983,0.7968,0.0002,4.6717,3.9573,0.6492,3.8581,1.8366,3.6303,3.3107,3.947,5.2927,1.1285,2.6837,1.9344,1.6431,5.3493,2.9548,3.1228,0.4795,1.633,0.5314,1.8528,4.1259,0.7094,1.9297,2.5275,1.7103,1.6598,4.0667,2.3222,5.1019,2.3525,1.068,0.0081,0.126,1.901,5.2818,3.0617,5.3641,3.2733,1.4212,5.0518,3.4235,1.622,0.1887,4.1385,4.3309,1.4525,1.85,4.5899,1.8329,5.7973,6.0044,0.931,0.837,3.7537,1.1775,2.8456,0.9908,0.2873,4.6739,0.3573,2.2106,0.5671,4.6122,1.0709,0.0824,5.7208,0.8806,1.7555,3.422,5.4311,0.3108,0.0847,3.658,1.6286,4.2875,2.5184,0.7714,4.5133,0.0173,0.0111,0.0016,0.0,1.1116,2.5769,2.8642,3.5372,0.2033,5.4653,1.6557,0.3321,6.9455,2.4105,0.1293,1.607,3.916,2.8274,3.694,0.0924,0.4324,6.5808,1.3149,2.0054,2.1182,0.1563,2.7694,0.1905,2.0616,1.6776,0.6166,1.9348,3.8081,0.0008,1.8663,1.8461,2.0158,6.6331,0.2336,1.4513,0.8027,0.9053,3.1353,2.8434,1.5828,1.4094,0.8798,1.8347,2.6594,3.3769,3.3745,0.0561,0.3147,1.333,1.2169,4.0461,0.022,1.7909,5.6433,1.6828,5.727,4.284,3.4424,3.4604,1.019,0.488,6.6654,3.6271,7.3672,1.2712,3.6778,3.0942,1.3723,1.6202,0.0317,2.4428,0.3678,0.9888,4.1648,0.392,2.0212,0.0002,1.8639,2.21,4.0662,4.173,0.2024,0.1172,0.6055,0.6272,0.0022,2.6618,0.5342,0.3709,0.0029,4.382,6.4961,4.9884,4.4639,0.8712,2.3963,1.3665,0.0422,0.0032,1.1094,0.2277,1.6779,5.5191,5.0284,1.0936,3.7713,0.7517,2.7982,1.5743,2.8335,0.4051,2.2639,2.9565,1.9714,1.0407,3.8201,0.0217,4.9226,2.334,0.253]}
{"id":4207,"ended":true,"length":486,"gen_text":"Typical examples of the breed measure between 22 \u2013 24 inches ( 56 \u2013 61 cm ) at the withers, with the average weight between 20 \u2013 25 kilograms ( 44 \u2013 55 lb ).\n\nIt was in the year 1866 that the first standard of the Akita Dog Kennel was established by Kazuaki Irimai.\n\nAn interesting story about the Akita Dog Kennel can be found in the history of the AKC.\n\nThe first Akita Dog Kennel was opened in the year 1866 by Kazuaki Irimai and Takahiro Mizoue in Kagoshima City, Kagou. On the 4th of May 1867 the first official Akita Dog Kennel Association was established by the two, with Izumi Aizawa serving as its first President. At the same time a large number of Akita Dogs were bred in the Kagoshima city.\n\nThis large supply soon began to dry up, and the new AKC policy of encouraging smaller, less pedigreed dogs and breedings, led to the large loss of the Akita Dog Kennel. In 1869 the first Akita Dog Kennel in Japan was founded by Izumi Aizawa who started the establishment of Akita Club (Akai) Kagoshima City where the official Akita Dog Kennels of Japan also started working.\n\nIn January 1871, the first standard of Akita breeding was published in Japan by Tosa Tokura, and the next year the first official Akita Dog Kennel, founded by Takahiro Mizoue, opened in Tokyo, Japan. By 1870, only three dogs were registered in Tokyo, with the first registered female being 1 year old. The birth date of this first registered male was 26 April 1888, but his registration at the beginning of the year was in the middle of the year.\n\nAccording to the AKC AKC breed standards for the Akita dogs, the A1, A2 and A3 categories. The first category, A2, refers to Akita breeds that have a wide, flat, flattened or nearly flat skull, long, short and fat or thin ears, a short muzzle, long hind legs, thick legs and short tail (A2). A2 also refer to small, fine, thin and long hairs on the forelegs and thighs (A2a). On the other hand, the A3 category includes Akita breeds with a broad and smooth surface, large, heavy and thick ears, a short muzzle with a square head, short forelegs, high legs and a short tail. Generally speaking, the A3 types display larger ears that those of the A2 breeds, longer foreleg bones and shorter hind leg bones than the A2 breeds, all of these characteristics being associated with the long and deep fur of A3 breeds.","token_len":583,"entropy":[0.2849,5.3748,0.6916,2.5219,9.3234,12.9791,2.836,4.8463,4.5793,1.7018,0.4099,2.1568,7.874,0.3212,1.5091,0.1387,2.1944,2.6939,0.1352,0.6231,0.0019,0.0116,1.6155,1.9183,1.5374,2.706,2.8147,3.0935,3.7133,0.1898,1.8015,4.2925,0.2174,1.2182,0.1497,2.8745,1.1256,0.8699,1.1046,0.0163,4.6211,3.1407,3.7566,1.112,4.1265,2.33,3.9925,0.3335,0.5636,0.9653,5.7374,2.1369,0.7368,5.4939,0.0864,3.5582,1.1242,0.0083,1.7804,1.5499,1.6252,5.5663,1.6661,0.7269,3.9453,4.8378,3.318,1.6413,1.9227,0.0002,5.7995,2.6884,3.4907,1.4102,0.4377,1.815,0.0364,1.3457,0.314,0.0195,2.2435,0.0128,0.408,0.3946,0.6593,5.2308,0.4465,0.4089,3.7541,0.0249,1.1925,0.9932,0.0002,1.7792,1.7643,1.3311,0.1057,1.544,0.1035,0.0629,0.6207,1.8088,0.3587,2.2271,1.0615,0.5881,0.5109,1.5809,0.3433,0.0249,0.0069,0.0159,0.0104,0.0016,3.5427,5.6969,1.7317,0.7012,4.974,5.1133,2.4749,3.1347,5.0124,0.1393,0.0016,3.9797,0.3077,1.6807,11.0555,2.1685,6.2485,1.4553,4.6323,0.0316,0.3424,2.237,1.0897,1.9404,2.0751,0.751,3.076,1.9085,0.0076,0.5375,0.2491,0.0146,2.9442,0.2596,1.0745,2.2698,1.124,1.6348,3.9761,2.0423,6.8935,0.5194,4.6525,2.1396,0.0715,3.7887,0.0222,1.4628,0.7602,1.7191,0.1293,4.4588,0.9769,1.158,0.0355,2.613,4.9991,1.0289,0.0033,0.5246,0.1746,0.6045,0.3164,2.6155,1.6778,1.0745,1.8952,0.0247,0.0013,3.7202,1.1736,0.7308,0.0002,3.8896,4.0041,6.3461,5.3928,2.9228,0.0886,3.8152,0.043,1.1303,0.9476,1.3196,4.749,3.1666,0.0953,5.8598,0.8842,4.3543,5.2882,2.3962,2.4067,6.0205,0.0034,0.003,0.9326,4.2081,3.283,5.8225,2.9671,2.5939,0.1082,0.7147,4.8121,4.8884,0.0998,0.9244,0.5836,0.1068,0.9965,1.3999,0.34,0.7238,2.5705,1.4062,2.1147,0.9357,2.2144,1.1156,0.0524,0.44,0.1683,0.0783,1.7312,2.1941,0.3205,3.1268,0.9431,4.2252,0.0022,0.2588,0.0066,0.0007,4.6973,4.39,1.8317,4.8606,0.2057,3.3006,0.0389,6.136,4.2503,2.1842,2.3362,2.5267,4.336,0.0078,0.0003,3.0869,5.9909,1.1712,5.3554,0.8128,0.0053,0.4965,0.0536,1.3677,2.848,0.872,6.9595,1.6408,5.2526,0.301,0.4398,0.0002,1.7591,5.7289,0.6059,1.6034,1.4168,0.9242,0.9629,4.5361,0.5272,1.891,0.0165,7.5996,0.2991,2.2441,1.7316,1.603,1.8719,4.7015,4.7761,5.0641,4.2524,1.3263,1.9019,1.4675,4.6646,0.4808,0.9134,0.7532,1.4426,0.6371,0.0049,0.7691,0.0366,0.1886,4.9153,4.2718,0.1835,3.1551,0.1113,0.0073,0.0096,0.0074,0.0019,0.523,3.1438,0.8058,2.6583,1.8641,0.9928,0.1228,4.7203,4.7686,0.8673,4.6402,2.9177,3.352,0.6453,1.5026,1.2364,2.9032,0.9596,2.6323,0.9241,2.6662,2.4201,4.0737,0.9467,5.0552,0.7043,0.1705,0.747,2.4088,5.917,3.0238,0.3192,2.9751,0.7624,1.1856,3.9644,0.8086,4.776,3.6454,5.9036,1.6938,3.6158,2.9034,1.8765,6.0851,0.4366,4.1537,0.3125,0.9264,1.0702,0.5817,3.5321,2.0771,3.6773,0.0385,1.6071,1.0315,0.7124,0.5707,0.0002,5.0453,0.015,0.6528,1.4856,0.012,5.1374,0.7474,4.1353,1.4351,2.8537,0.8692,0.2676,0.0057,5.038,0.6251,0.7693,5.9365,3.7236,2.798,0.3759,0.1089,0.8969,0.1646,0.0629,3.0656,5.0309,1.4087,3.2381,3.1718,2.9003,0.4776,2.308,0.4817,2.7281,0.0508,2.9637,0.4781,3.8748,1.439,1.4497,1.779,4.8067,4.0006,2.1122,2.04,4.8695,4.4456,5.3809,0.121,2.3474,1.0819,4.1302,2.0178,4.3736,1.9176,5.1962,3.2203,0.8838,3.0577,0.4801,2.2969,1.9166,1.5206,0.6673,2.9522,5.9423,0.2333,0.7703,4.2834,2.7633,1.0599,2.1195,0.606,4.2491,3.295,1.1336,1.4852,3.4312,0.9145,4.2663,5.0187,0.1277,5.6525,1.4598,5.1232,1.7652,3.6333,1.6523,2.841,2.6818,0.8824,0.0863,4.4674,1.0146,0.0386,1.3715,5.8141,1.9369,0.2502,0.2159,1.6802,0.7869,4.718,0.1115,0.2804,0.0239,0.1413,0.9842,0.7915,0.5671,0.551,3.5741,0.7607,0.0372,0.2592,0.9695,0.8767,2.758,2.4534,4.6984,5.7689,1.0905,3.8496,1.3125,3.532,1.6141,1.0263,1.2664,0.1668,1.8102,1.0021,0.2153,4.0915,1.1534,5.5045,3.683,0.6106,1.6452,2.9083,0.1475,0.0134,0.5751,5.5847,1.8442,0.7199,1.4424,0.8565,0.0942,1.6698,6.6901,1.3974,0.1028,0.872,0.8914,0.8048,5.0865,6.201,4.2865,2.7079,5.5854,4.0349,0.2788,0.5054,0.0586,0.088,2.8374,1.2828,3.6043,1.8428,0.0485,7.396,1.0302,2.4294,2.8,3.1523,0.0254,2.1375,0.9785,0.0878,0.0375,1.0913,1.7668,6.3943,0.7395,3.567,1.4303,1.6788,3.3654,0.0495,1.3127,4.5512,2.4008,5.4844,3.2138,1.7112,2.2008,0.1599,1.4458,0.2387]}
{"id":231,"ended":true,"length":449,"gen_text":"The monuments of Tonin\u00e1 tend to be smaller than those at other Maya sites, with most of the stelae measuring less than 2 metres ( 6 @. @ 6 ft ) tall.\n\nNortheastern Peru (Atacamarca), the Yap-Ullur Valley and Huaro Canyon are also known to have been sites for the manufacture of the statuary\n\nThis research into the development of Tonin\u00e1 has also been followed closely by the archaeologists and archaeologists have examined the stelae in detail and been interested in documenting where they are located and analysing their dimensions.\n\nA number of the stelae appear to have been deliberately set up in a particular location and have been moved on various occasions. A large area of about 700 meters was destroyed on May 16, 2007 by a landslide at the Luschak monument ( Tonin\u00e1 Risque ) in the Yap-Ullur Valley. The monument dates to some time between the 13th and 16th centuries, and there are believed to be about 700 stelae at this site.\n\nAt Rancagua Rancagua Tola was also a famous sculptor who worked from around the 13th to 17th century. These days his statue of Kukulkan (Kukulkan) stands in the town of San Lorenzo, in the northern province of Coahuila. He may have moved the statue occasionally to avoid potential dangers.\n\nThere are a lot of similar statues in San Lorenzo today but they have remained in the same place due to that incident as they had been moved on a number of occasions.\n\nMost of the local and foreign tourists visiting Tonin\u00e1 today are from North America, Australia and New Zealand. The local people also love their tourism as they see it as a potential job opportunity.\n\nTonin\u00e1 is a spectacular example of the culture of Mesoamerica, where people were very conscious about how they used natural resources so there was abundant evidence of agriculture, metallurgy, metallurgy and stone-working practices.\n\nMany areas of Tonin\u00e1 have been surveyed using aerial photography and are used for bird watching, walking trails and hiking.

{"id":4319,"ended":true,"length":515,"gen_text":"Not many predators challenge an adult black mamba although it does face a few threats such as birds of prey, particularly snake eagles. Although all species of snake eagle commonly prey on snakes, black mambas are the largest snake in the insect world and sometimes exceed the size of other snakes.Black mambas also have a reputation for attacking humans. In addition to snakes, black mambas also possess fangs that are used to puncture mammalian or bird prey (sometimes including lizards) before swallowing. The bite of a Black Mamba is usually so small that human injury is rare.\n\nBlack mambas have a complex mating ritual with their females. Female black mambas lay eggs on the ground but for each egg she swallows, she will lay twice as many. If any one of her eggs is not found after the first day, the mamba will not come into the forest until the next day. Female black mambas also produce a single, long, sticky strand of silk, which males can climb using their pectoral muscles to grasp and tear.\n\nBlack mambas have a very large oral sac in which they store their grog. This is eaten in a slow, rhythmic gulp, sometimes mixed with fluid (usually sweat) from the skin where the sac is located. When the grog is finished, the mamba will roll it into small balls and regurgitate it.\n\nBlack mamba females are very protective of their eggs and will fight the male at any opportunity.\n\nWhen a male mamba is threatened, he can open up his mouth large enough to expose his fangs and strike back. It is very dangerous for both the male and female as the bite is designed for quick death. When in danger, the black mamba will sometimes urinate a little on the ground, to which the female simply walks past. The urine is repugnant to most animals. At this time of month, many females will choose to forage alone. The black mamba will then return to its natal den, ready for its next breeding season.\n\nBlack mambas are a highly secretive lizards that spend a lot of time underground. They can be easily overlooked if you have a dog or are wearing sunglasses indoors. When outside you will not be able to see them from a distance.\n\nBlack mambas have a very special and powerful venomous bite, the venom is powerful enough to make a person sick if not treated quickly. Even a small bite can be fatal with symptoms, such as respiratory distress, nausea, high fever, vomiting, rash, and the ability to lead to liver and kidney damage that can kill the person if untreated.\n\nBlack mambas eat mice, frogs, lizards, snakes, birds and amphibians. They also eat other snakes and other invertebrates.","token_len":584,"entropy":[5.6445,9.7089,8.8143,3.6452,2.0401,3.6517,4.6924,0.0227,8.5166,1.8549,2.323,6.5199,1.9426,2.3816,2.2159,3.2238,0.0046,6.4872,1.688,0.0083,1.2448,6.453,8.2567,4.2428,0.0032,1.295,4.8341,6.1823,2.7664,0.4384,3.7275,2.5635,6.3886,1.314,0.1323,3.9517,0.4373,2.2321,0.0098,0.1263,0.0017,0.5589,2.1488,3.5813,2.1848,1.167,0.7888,5.7199,2.7217,1.0846,5.8089,5.1217,1.2654,0.481,0.0277,3.7226,1.1699,0.498,6.0177,0.0133,0.0571,0.0015,3.0978,1.5459,0.9613,1.5654,0.3108,2.9181,1.3928,1.424,2.2432,4.2661,0.2179,4.4195,0.371,1.1908,0.0042,0.0536,0.0006,2.1416,6.354,4.8517,0.0035,1.2242,0.9479,2.5965,0.5352,2.9592,0.0005,6.7445,4.3795,0.5599,2.2817,3.6751,5.814,3.2968,5.6243,0.0034,1.6206,4.1927,1.0513,1.567,2.6524,3.3614,0.2259,0.3682,5.5681,0.4118,0.0095,0.8345,3.062,4.6935,5.3376,0.5559,4.4398,2.4647,0.2668,1.3287,0.6987,2.1648,0.004,2.0097,0.2791,0.1464,0.002,2.5665,1.3762,5.0286,2.811,1.5295,3.4656,3.6565,2.1802,2.5712,4.0769,1.1409,0.0032,0.0647,0.0004,3.9895,1.8295,3.0238,1.0512,0.94,5.2375,5.556,3.9165,0.4906,3.3011,5.7858,0.0001,0.7682,0.2478,1.6232,2.9689,6.0245,0.4768,0.0124,1.1055,3.4626,5.111,2.9263,0.5736,1.1285,0.0877,0.7585,1.4751,4.3139,3.2654,3.2505,1.8806,1.6422,0.2367,1.3835,3.3272,0.107,0.4099,2.4327,6.2561,4.0874,0.8637,3.5331,3.2839,0.7074,1.2825,0.6329,0.4952,3.8028,0.2762,0.0026,0.0495,0.0003,2.5261,3.6593,0.9359,5.3023,2.3924,2.3501,1.0796,1.8497,2.1884,0.1386,1.0353,2.9541,0.617,4.767,1.4416,4.8207,7.2191,0.7317,4.6874,0.849,0.013,1.1324,1.3945,3.4527,1.5757,5.475,1.2705,1.585,0.0002,1.2782,0.0654,0.1238,0.0008,2.3824,1.2602,2.7468,2.7435,6.1731,4.103,2.9702,0.6308,0.6051,1.3032,1.795,6.1746,4.3361,0.8733,2.2879,1.8273,5.3708,2.4121,2.2536,4.1617,0.7854,3.4304,0.0015,2.5386,0.1286,1.8753,4.0446,4.3961,0.0296,5.9751,3.9685,2.973,4.338,0.9367,0.8478,0.4547,3.348,6.3044,0.9814,1.4375,0.7972,0.749,0.111,3.332,1.0185,0.7139,0.0072,0.2793,2.3516,0.2462,0.3801,2.106,0.0673,1.5835,4.538,1.5024,1.3689,4.1964,0.2962,0.8733,5.4907,0.0033,0.0007,0.3868,1.3243,1.7014,0.0002,1.0885,0.0341,2.1961,3.3697,1.6643,2.7281,1.878,0.0695,0.0464,1.0173,0.8111,0.9403,3.021,5.7454,1.3017,5.473,1.5511,0.958,0.675,2.8136,0.0001,4.6865,1.8553,1.6039,1.5608,0.0239,1.4389,3.4237,0.496,0.7295,3.6626,4.9443,3.5707,0.6298,0.3594,6.3945,0.0356,0.1319,2.8885,0.721,1.2087,0.0266,1.0207,3.3786,3.8961,0.7705,4.3098,0.3315,3.4031,2.6819,0.5305,2.8993,1.1164,0.5648,0.0507,0.5644,3.0153,0.9344,2.856,1.6967,6.0583,2.9697,4.7792,3.22,0.7687,4.2671,3.9756,1.9813,0.2317,0.9075,3.1714,0.0101,0.0247,0.7171,3.5747,4.9404,0.0018,5.3683,4.964,2.222,0.9307,0.1839,2.1861,3.4976,4.6016,0.5212,2.1757,6.47,3.9776,4.7093,0.8554,2.7308,2.7816,1.3171,5.2995,1.2477,0.0053,0.1057,1.7222,1.9536,2.4453,6.8646,2.4888,1.344,1.8244,6.6787,0.2677,4.5045,2.3431,1.0323,4.6781,0.2533,3.3295,0.6308,2.9877,1.5095,3.4436,2.9122,0.0301,0.0295,1.5513,3.4667,3.1927,0.2119,1.688,4.2997,0.0309,2.2197,1.7204,5.0199,1.3827,2.6899,0.1304,1.7975,0.5128,0.0697,0.3362,0.0001,1.3117,0.0494,0.141,0.0011,0.963,3.7971,4.0324,4.2091,7.2618,0.8704,1.5808,2.6547,2.6201,0.4624,0.002,0.1347,1.7265,0.395,0.8587,2.5009,0.7763,2.9814,2.6973,2.882,0.8257,3.376,2.1498,4.3853,0.7543,3.5648,5.0658,3.6969,3.0626,0.4044,3.4728,5.6465,4.9622,1.309,3.1839,1.48,0.069,0.0032,0.2511,0.8144,3.5435,0.6883,0.6107,1.1676,1.4834,0.0001,1.0254,0.0461,0.1052,0.001,2.3051,1.0868,1.9173,4.9409,3.9482,4.3038,1.1939,2.7299,0.2989,2.3302,3.6533,2.3508,1.1353,4.6409,0.1174,0.0397,4.7931,1.5217,1.2051,2.7354,2.8821,3.2484,0.8076,1.4608,0.1749,4.6105,1.9772,1.237,1.4426,0.469,1.0841,0.5875,5.5414,2.9825,6.263,1.3937,0.0026,5.14,1.7398,0.3985,3.3091,0.3959,5.7972,1.073,0.4689,2.1566,0.4284,5.5187,0.442,1.1466,5.2593,3.6945,0.085,4.5755,0.07,4.2036,1.4373,0.1841,2.0455,6.0093,0.7169,4.3899,1.7968,1.9394,2.9,1.4154,0.0785,0.8283,0.0001,1.1728,0.0307,0.136,0.0011,4.5826,5.389,0.3706,2.427,0.1265,1.3416,0.0,0.159,1.2225,0.2433,1.4871,1.7093,6.1768,0.0266,0.4406,1.0815,1.832,0.6366,3.0408,2.0959,1.5037,2.6267,3.2355,0.0011,0.0231,0.8111]}
{"id":3478,"ended":true,"length":523,"gen_text":"Similarly to other Brazilian universities, Unicamp offers no large @ - @ scale in @ - @ campus housing, and most students live either near the campus or in Campinas. A student can easily go to Campinas for vacation to Cilao (near Porto Alegre) or to Rond\u00f4nia (about 100 km away), for short visits in several locations.\n\nThis university offers a significant number of degree programs in Computer Science, Engineering and Architecture (including Architecture and Planning) and is well-respected on the academic rankings pages of various industry journals and portals. The university is also the location of some world famous companies, including Cisco Systems (founded in 1988 by R. J. McEnery and Richard Hendricks), Brazil's first multinational, with branches all over the world: Intel(R) Corporation (founded in 1914 by Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce), and Motorola(R) Systems(R) (founded in 1958 by William McKinley, who later led the semiconductor business for both IBM and Motorola).\n\nInstitutional information\n\nStudent Life Student Life Unicamp provides undergraduate and graduate students with facilities, programs and support.\n\nResearch and publication This university is located in one of the most industrialized regions of the world and offers extensive facilities to support research.\n\nCampus contact hours These campus locations provide easy access to the most common public transportation (Rua dos \u00d3rdens), as well as free parking in the Rua Teremburrenhos and Rua Santa Maria (close to main road), and free bus services to many locations.\n\nDegree programs In addition to various degree programs, Unicamp offers five courses with an emphasis in Computer Science, including a semester in Software Engineering (with a focus on cloud computing and cloud security), and an M.S.\/P.S., an S.E. in Computer Science Engineering (one semester, in which the final project emphasizes on cloud computing and cloud security), and the Doctoral students specialize in Data Science, Data Science Programming and Data Sciences.\n\nStudents are free to choose their programs during the first year of study, providing that they want to continue in the same program at the end of the program.\n\nTransportation Unicamp provides a wide range of transportation options: buses, taxis, Metro, buses, trains, bikes, foot, and more. There is a dedicated bus for students with ID cards. Students with the free Metro pass to the city of Campinas can ride to the first day lecture.

{"id":3507,"ended":true,"length":460,"gen_text":"In the early 1940s, many young Puerto Rican men were drafted for World War II, among them Santos. Santos recorded `` Despedida `` ( My Good @ - @ bye ), a song about his home in the mountains of Puerto Rico, and the struggle to support his family.\n\nIn 1943, Santos also composed and recorded the song La Leyenda in which he sings a version of the classic Filipino fable about two blind brothers who meet during their father's time as a slave.\n\nThe song was released on the label he had operated under, Rama 5-C, and became a hit. The album version is a version with two minor differences: one ending with the words, `` La Leyenda llegas, ` ` but both with `` La Leyenda siempre `` or `` I am going to make a new life for myself `` in the middle.\n\nOne of Mr. Santos's songs, `` Niebla dito `` and the song about the Virgin Mary, `` Dia de los Muertos, ` `` were recorded by his son on the label Rama 5-B.

{"id":4016,"ended":true,"length":536,"gen_text":"The critical ionization velocity is the relative velocity between an ionized plasma and a neutral gas, above which a runaway ionization process takes place. The critical ionization process is a quite general mechanism, occurring in almost all types of atoms and molecules and acting to create strong electrically charged plasma in objects with electrically charged nuclei, although it has a very short range in nature, it can easily occur in extremely close proximity with electrically neutral gas.\n\nThere are several processes that can create the critical ionization process in an object:\n\nA) Electron scattering: If it is charged and ionized (i.e. if it has a p + or p - ionization), then it will absorb light or radiation and cause electrons to escape. If charged with an electron, this produces an electron-hole pair. This results in a large ionization of the object, i.e. the formation of plasma, and a large amount of energy transfer to the object itself. This process can be seen with fluorescent materials and metals. B ) Photon capture: photons are emitted by some of the atoms or molecules in the environment. If the object is charged, the radiation is absorbed and transformed into energy, which can be transferred from one of the electrons towards the nucleus (leading to electron splitting). This energy transfer process is one of the most common processes, which is responsible for the creation of ionized gas. It is sometimes called'ionization '. C ) Electron transfer: The electrons in the object's nucleus are attracted to the nucleus of another atom. This creates an electric field between the two that can transfer energy between the two objects. The energy of these electrons is released when they ionize the second substance, creating a plasma.\n\nThe plasma created during a runaway ionization process is ionized gas at the molecular level, which is in very short range in nature. Unlike a flame or flame-triggered electrical charge transfer mechanism, this process is typically so large in nature (1M to 10M electron volts) that it is practically impossible to cause even very large quantities of ionized gas during a runaway ionization process.\n\nA highly ionized plasma can rapidly rise to temperatures so hot that the temperature of the air around the object becomes too cold for atoms to survive without the help of a magnetic field. At this level of temperatures, atoms and molecules simply cannot survive. If you had a device that was built sufficiently large, that had a sufficiently strong electromagnetic field around it, you could theoretically take this to the extreme.\n\nThese extreme, extremely high temperature, ionized gas conditions can be produced from a rapid release of energy by either a high frequency electromagnetic wave that excites the gas itself, causing a brief 'flash mob' of ionized gases that are released over a relatively fast time-span (sometimes only a few milliseconds) or a lightning bolt.","token_len":585,"entropy":[9.1606,12.2398,3.5218,6.7679,1.858,1.5737,6.1088,1.6318,1.4029,2.2944,1.7068,1.3455,4.4218,0.2469,1.0477,2.8701,2.1538,1.8978,8.1296,0.3559,2.4969,6.5507,2.7455,0.0814,2.0036,2.648,0.0432,0.304,1.3588,1.0625,0.9535,0.0521,5.6811,1.1406,2.348,8.0955,3.6832,2.4363,1.7336,4.7456,0.7111,4.2167,0.4574,3.4858,0.0068,4.6831,0.7391,0.3118,3.2069,5.3795,1.9131,3.8038,4.9444,4.8442,0.6444,0.7086,3.5173,3.1627,6.1624,2.8159,5.2873,0.0541,0.8119,2.2415,0.0004,2.4549,6.1771,1.2738,3.095,2.1066,2.747,4.6867,0.9472,2.8732,3.5198,2.3056,5.8492,1.2884,3.7558,1.6783,0.6765,4.5854,3.6799,0.2159,4.2574,4.3486,0.0231,0.5868,2.5073,0.7604,1.1301,0.0044,4.5305,0.2704,1.97,4.3811,0.9957,0.7286,2.9418,2.3854,0.6574,0.1138,0.0183,1.7847,1.9786,1.7114,0.9243,2.6305,0.3138,0.0002,3.366,3.7601,2.8741,0.6103,4.3805,2.1245,4.5732,5.8537,0.2908,4.0848,3.136,2.5735,0.049,3.1565,2.2449,0.0028,0.0031,0.2457,2.1854,0.963,1.0542,0.8816,6.6197,3.7609,2.2702,0.5041,0.6359,1.0013,1.0659,1.4183,2.1724,1.423,0.5431,3.3173,4.7009,4.2788,3.385,1.8694,2.9615,3.0519,0.1314,3.5915,1.7638,2.6811,5.5737,4.2675,1.2544,1.3969,0.5999,3.2488,5.1333,1.5233,1.1511,0.7908,0.6468,0.0375,1.6403,2.502,4.9224,0.008,0.9547,4.4373,2.9804,0.8047,1.1713,0.1137,1.3571,1.2655,5.7548,0.0022,0.0008,0.0319,1.9271,4.3045,0.0123,3.6024,2.2462,1.0475,1.7386,1.9589,2.5166,0.0046,1.3724,5.6061,1.6955,0.145,1.2821,5.4041,0.369,2.0551,1.0769,1.6466,0.8936,3.0753,2.9772,5.1202,2.9416,2.6251,4.8819,1.1749,3.8332,6.5216,3.7163,0.8034,4.886,0.184,7.1902,1.6133,1.4984,1.5595,5.0329,3.3729,0.0486,0.8092,1.6678,0.0513,0.7636,0.5624,3.7377,1.2778,1.9125,1.2197,1.9826,0.628,1.0493,1.2232,1.8134,4.1439,1.7436,1.0165,1.0252,5.4975,0.1867,3.9009,1.2968,1.1627,1.1689,0.5408,1.5128,3.7454,2.141,5.4213,0.0452,2.7339,7.1672,0.3188,1.8633,3.4529,5.8136,0.0201,2.8663,7.5326,0.8041,0.9538,3.8135,1.1361,2.9635,1.1347,4.9058,0.2414,0.0231,1.3195,1.2185,1.2675,3.5511,3.0513,1.6285,2.1782,0.0139,0.6337,1.8117,0.0275,2.8437,0.5731,1.8275,1.3714,3.1149,0.7922,5.047,1.2094,10.9959,3.4918,1.0512,12.5391,0.414,0.7935,1.3654,0.147,2.9793,0.1911,2.7343,1.2277,1.3778,0.4578,0.7782,5.5305,1.3965,0.8739,2.409,0.4248,0.8311,2.387,0.6569,0.9518,0.6634,2.6528,1.0041,2.3444,1.0703,2.7278,0.9839,2.001,0.1679,0.3122,5.921,1.8951,2.553,1.0915,2.2033,0.5743,0.4351,3.1114,0.3712,2.3525,2.5888,2.5467,4.0211,1.9484,0.7927,2.4886,2.2849,0.3046,5.2097,0.0236,0.4304,4.359,4.2865,1.5674,1.9533,0.8077,0.7221,0.482,1.452,0.0002,1.6092,4.4288,1.6118,3.6393,1.9492,1.8965,0.3391,0.0107,0.1968,0.8971,4.2848,0.0188,1.7296,4.9002,2.1187,3.1022,0.18,0.9856,1.7719,0.8173,4.4167,4.6217,2.0241,0.6066,3.526,0.2832,0.712,6.1093,1.7452,4.9022,1.7378,3.1094,1.5478,6.048,0.5925,0.0002,3.9758,3.7722,2.3745,4.7144,0.1666,2.3652,1.1078,1.0148,5.5799,5.1877,4.7122,1.8432,3.4259,4.1631,4.8917,6.6941,1.6249,0.628,0.1537,3.955,0.9636,0.4062,0.0625,0.3963,1.218,4.7953,0.4933,0.1556,5.3355,4.9831,3.5834,1.4741,2.3544,0.0333,1.187,0.4708,0.0622,7.0618,0.7559,0.6127,0.2605,0.0057,0.2302,0.3415,0.9242,0.0002,3.1021,5.9494,1.6836,0.035,0.8231,1.5501,5.2823,4.3169,0.6164,1.9844,5.3179,2.3167,0.1981,1.8935,4.0801,0.5203,0.3222,3.3117,1.416,1.0358,0.4063,2.9214,4.1938,4.4138,0.9727,3.2201,0.5273,3.3947,4.7939,2.6318,1.6196,0.0021,1.5184,2.7131,0.0395,0.3648,2.6075,1.3872,3.8336,1.1433,3.8245,0.1842,2.7768,1.9847,0.0712,4.7123,2.7213,1.6915,1.5044,4.0346,3.8228,4.2394,0.7876,4.7439,1.2894,1.5757,4.7731,7.175,1.2366,2.5132,3.5274,3.077,1.3071,2.5058,2.2721,4.7192,0.0647,2.7754,0.0745,0.3016,1.5538,0.2853,3.2538,6.1872,2.4019,2.1919,0.6141,0.6293,1.8686,1.2321,0.0002,5.5759,2.2694,5.7414,3.3217,0.9158,1.6068,2.2548,2.3412,0.3225,0.5253,3.0309,1.7354,0.9012,3.3488,3.9568,1.2553,5.8541,3.1124,0.0334,1.2499,2.8007,5.7068,1.1183,2.4063,2.9984,2.1937,2.2607,3.9116,5.4761,0.0023,0.9495,2.1632,5.4791,0.4858,5.8119,1.9333,5.3916,3.6151,1.0985,7.4406,0.2771,0.8828,1.9014,0.8328,3.1807,2.9556,2.8047,2.7829,3.9396,0.2435,2.4121,7.5831,1.052,1.921,2.212,1.8948,5.4838,3.1467,0.3908,0.2514,1.2566,1.8011,0.2708,1.5292,4.2616,2.5391,1.7671]}
{"id":4671,"ended":true,"length":521,"gen_text":"Kovacs initially passed the walk @ - @ on tryouts, but he had to pass the physical with Paul `` < unk > `` Schmidt, who had been a trainer since Jordan's rookie year in Atlanta. He finally played in 2010 and 2011. During the 2012-2013 offseason, he was traded to the Atlanta Thrashers for Michael Latta and a first round draft pick (currently #24.) He quickly became part of the Thrashers depth chart and played his first game on October 16.\n\nHe played on the Thrashers 2011 playoff team. However, it didn't matter as the new head coach Mike Sullivan demoted him after two games, with Latta and the rest of the NHL team on injured reserve. That season, he played with the Hershey Bears of the AHL for one more game. His team was bounced in the first round of the playoffs. He signed with the Washington Capitals but did not see any action as John Carlson's season started and he became the full time starter, with Mike Green taking a step back due to injuries. After the season ended his rights reverted to the Thrashers. He played for them in the lockout and on the 2015-2016 NHL season.\n\nKovacs had an excellent season in the KHL. He won the Art Ross Trophy for leading the league in scoring, scoring in every single game, had the second best points percentage, and had a career high 34 goals. He was also an amazing minus player.\n\nHe was traded to Chicago at the February draft along with Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane, and after three games with the Blackhawks, he was released.\n\nHis first NHL game was an injury filled one, as he missed 15 games with the Thrashers, but he still managed 26 points. On October 5th at the Boston Potsdam, in the first game of a home-and-home pair with the Bruins, Kovacs scored a goal and finished with one assist for two points (2g, 1a) in just 15:24. That was only the third time that Kovacs scored a goal for the Thrashers in the postseason; he scored a goal in the final at Boston.\n\nOn March 23rd, at the 2015 AHL All-Star Classic, Kovacs played in his first AHL playoff game. He scored a goal and finished with 2 assists in the 3-2 win over Syracuse. He has a decent shot but isn't much of a scorer and is not overly physical.\n\nIn July, Kovacs signed with the Nashville Predators as a free agent but he never lived up to the hype that surrounded the 2012 NHL Draft pick. He had 0 goals and 10 points in 33 games with the Predators. He was eventually dealt to the Pittsburgh Penguins two days before the start of the 2015-16 season for Brandon Sutter and Rob Klinkhammer.","token_len":585,"entropy":[6.7946,1.5544,9.905,7.1957,1.883,9.2075,15.0505,7.288,10.162,8.4472,9.846,3.7766,1.6682,0.9313,2.5285,3.5328,1.0854,4.6338,0.8955,6.0443,4.4003,9.0978,13.7947,11.0871,9.6486,3.5603,3.1956,4.6085,7.858,2.1306,0.9445,2.411,1.9973,2.679,6.2302,3.4681,8.5204,1.764,1.2552,0.5723,2.6977,5.5055,0.3131,3.0391,5.7264,5.0408,1.3719,4.6083,2.7279,2.1239,1.4024,4.9048,1.2959,2.4086,1.3642,2.1945,3.4406,0.2142,0.9356,1.6942,2.1712,0.1686,0.8392,4.6044,0.839,0.0029,0.0008,2.1422,5.5083,2.2005,0.0029,1.3383,0.8296,3.2957,1.4363,1.2154,0.0735,2.778,5.0552,2.1539,3.9108,5.171,1.9685,5.8699,1.1539,4.8271,0.003,0.328,1.5198,0.0003,0.0245,4.8139,0.0949,1.2249,2.0,4.6495,1.0962,1.8192,1.7991,1.8338,3.49,3.6813,1.9432,0.0334,2.8224,2.2769,3.9839,0.6525,1.2428,0.0003,0.0079,4.5887,1.6838,0.1112,2.4814,5.025,0.109,3.4999,2.6698,0.0039,3.2023,2.3833,1.35,6.2719,4.1837,0.0137,2.274,3.7453,5.7193,0.0007,0.1948,2.9748,3.3691,0.3287,2.2728,4.8169,5.1968,0.0088,2.6808,3.1632,2.9027,0.0312,0.0774,4.9251,1.31,3.2633,4.4501,0.0057,0.1974,4.7476,2.9896,0.5372,0.7753,1.318,4.6826,0.403,4.4049,0.0053,0.0057,0.964,0.0153,0.2309,2.8165,3.0316,1.3965,1.2823,1.2088,4.1136,6.0464,1.4772,4.9362,0.5516,0.3183,0.2245,0.0032,0.9894,0.0375,0.1518,0.9622,1.8944,3.216,0.7723,0.2512,4.2826,0.0085,4.3236,3.2364,0.0134,1.9557,0.8094,1.8282,3.5635,6.8255,0.3561,4.3954,3.8491,3.3091,2.7325,1.1223,3.1788,0.7121,2.9701,0.8852,1.3388,3.8124,2.7233,3.1601,0.1626,3.208,3.285,3.3204,0.3942,4.812,0.0069,1.7512,0.2391,3.4636,1.6426,0.8911,2.1742,6.5158,3.2294,2.9631,0.4476,0.3283,0.5906,0.0014,0.0009,1.326,1.5262,1.5248,2.4694,3.0556,1.0387,0.981,2.7913,4.4801,5.4147,0.9782,4.7471,0.2805,0.0538,2.7761,0.5787,0.7125,0.8246,0.0002,1.5739,0.046,0.0266,3.0529,2.5014,1.9843,1.7907,1.0524,1.2097,3.8953,0.0085,1.9936,0.4221,3.019,0.3812,4.6143,0.0523,0.8102,2.0476,3.2665,0.4445,0.1404,0.1791,0.7429,1.9484,2.9121,3.5633,2.9628,1.5245,0.265,1.2686,4.9318,2.3597,2.0126,1.3642,1.813,2.284,3.0911,0.717,2.3897,2.0225,2.9434,0.1548,5.356,0.2767,0.5673,0.58,1.3858,1.6691,3.5256,5.7729,5.0763,1.6597,1.9787,1.8223,0.0002,2.2912,1.522,1.5798,0.2932,5.3299,3.2189,0.0236,5.3144,4.3618,3.2492,0.0054,5.4059,0.0433,0.0,0.9756,1.9958,0.6565,2.2518,1.8272,4.3257,4.2757,1.0114,1.7509,0.2455,0.6139,0.8188,0.7153,0.1915,3.5971,0.8183,1.5725,0.0002,4.6008,1.8619,1.7651,1.4522,0.5522,4.6789,1.4557,2.2818,1.3267,1.6753,1.5844,0.1735,2.1567,5.2051,0.1385,0.93,3.3374,2.5139,0.0005,0.0017,2.537,1.8495,1.2717,3.8279,0.9721,5.9093,0.3947,2.4158,4.7589,2.1315,3.5649,1.7421,5.3945,1.1054,3.0329,8.4619,3.4349,0.183,0.8306,5.1097,1.3273,1.1525,0.4919,0.7454,0.8623,2.7656,0.5162,0.015,0.0044,0.0151,8.476,0.6818,0.401,0.5999,0.0905,1.2019,0.0188,0.6387,1.9306,0.739,1.0263,4.84,0.7262,4.1757,0.1787,3.5254,1.723,0.0327,4.0033,2.2833,2.2462,1.1219,0.3388,0.0039,0.8574,0.4136,3.3439,3.4712,0.1406,3.8863,1.3351,3.3714,1.3625,4.6406,0.744,2.6142,0.9786,2.6111,1.5316,0.0139,1.3944,1.1714,0.2284,3.9695,0.3217,0.6501,0.0005,0.001,1.5357,1.9012,5.2013,4.2318,1.4262,2.2538,1.9065,0.5362,0.6618,0.7374,4.0395,6.6284,1.1864,1.8802,0.9754,0.0002,2.5755,2.8604,3.5654,0.2446,0.2487,4.416,0.454,4.8697,3.203,0.0334,0.1304,0.0129,1.3054,0.3953,0.3193,0.0107,1.9891,0.9261,0.9512,0.3704,2.8163,3.1304,0.0193,1.3311,0.376,1.2768,1.1637,0.1213,0.8299,1.1537,0.056,3.2993,0.0875,1.1089,2.3161,2.7624,0.0734,0.4454,1.1656,0.5,3.3966,0.2728,1.3225,4.8714,3.588,6.0208,1.5716,2.5257,3.2401,0.0007,2.5555,0.0365,0.1247,3.4965,2.522,1.993,2.3036,4.5706,0.2183,0.3631,1.1687,0.0002,2.6498,4.8283,1.4527,1.0406,0.0151,0.9805,1.2664,0.3448,4.5823,0.0093,2.0736,0.3026,0.1019,0.0108,3.685,2.5399,2.3467,5.4776,0.0043,0.0075,0.917,0.481,2.7028,2.1259,3.1972,6.242,2.084,0.7496,0.8393,0.3239,0.6003,1.9794,5.7836,1.7417,0.1587,4.0281,1.3234,0.064,4.2658,0.1639,1.1973,0.4054,0.6571,0.876,1.0523,1.3715,2.8793,2.6645,0.1599,0.4484,3.4156,0.004,7.85,0.8513,0.9354,0.1249,1.4947,0.0033,0.0488,2.185,0.1788,3.2191,0.221,2.7571,4.3529,0.0536,0.0003,0.9001,4.1311,0.8456,0.0017,0.0002,0.2235]}
{"id":2417,"ended":true,"length":554,"gen_text":"One of the greatest potential dangers of faith in the Bates method is that a believer may be disinclined to seek medical advice regarding what could be a sight @ - @ threatening condition requiring immediate medical attention. A more extreme way to describe the Bates Method method is to say that it is dangerous and potentially deadly for a Christian to trust in the Bates Method.\n\nThere is a Biblical principle that says: \"If there is a God, He will deal justly with his own and none of ours. Therefore do not lay up for yourselves treasures upon earth; where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, and where robbers break through and steal; where fire and earthquake and the thunder and the lightning destroy and destroy and destroy all that is written about with a flash of lightning\" (Proverbs 23:10-12). God never takes things away from anyone who has trusted in His living love for them.\n\nThis principle can guide Christians who hope to trust in the Bates Method method. They should realize that there are many reasons why we may experience physical symptoms that seem to correspond with the physical symptoms of a sight @ - @ threatening condition. This also means that when a person's faith in God and trusting in Him leads to them trusting in the Bates Method, there very well might be a physical symptom associated with one of the physical symptoms of a sight @ - @ threatening condition.\n\nThe Christian is reminded that \"all things originate from God, and by God's mercy we have every gift\" (Ephesians 1:11). When a believer trust in God and trusting in Him leads a person to trusting in the Bates Method, God will provide for that believer when the time comes that they need help, and God can help a believer in this matter even after their faith in Jesus Christ is gone.\n\nThis is the message of the Lord Jesus Christ in His Sermon on the Mount:\n\n\"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you\" (Matthew 7:7).\n\nThese are just a few of the many reasons why we have the Lord Jesus Christ in our lives. To put faith in God and trusting in His love and power will always be a sure remedy for problems that a Christian may encounter. However, Christian faith in God will never lead to failure in one's faith. Christian faith in God and trusting in Christ's love will always lead to success over and above what is possible with conventional physical remedies.\n\nIf a Christian knows that God, through His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, is in their life, they can trust in the promise of divine mercy when that Christian finds that physical symptom of a sight @ - @ threatening condition. The Christian can trust in this promise, for divine mercy is a blessing from God (Genesis 16:7-12).","token_len":585,"entropy":[1.2901,0.3166,4.6834,8.2629,3.9089,1.0582,9.056,2.3308,1.5086,13.4535,5.1195,0.4271,0.6588,4.1675,3.6938,1.4479,2.5287,7.0924,0.9198,0.0079,0.0004,0.0541,2.7605,4.3111,1.9727,5.3005,4.587,4.3023,0.3097,1.493,12.7344,15.9826,6.9147,8.77,11.3215,3.418,7.1429,1.1393,1.6257,0.2327,0.4432,3.5801,5.0181,5.5875,6.3954,0.9146,4.2619,1.5595,1.3223,1.9071,6.978,0.4297,1.2489,0.8175,0.2355,0.6937,1.001,4.1432,2.6747,2.5629,2.1506,3.5335,1.6482,3.7449,0.4385,4.5529,1.3345,1.2344,2.0493,0.9102,1.2602,1.5405,0.0905,4.0788,1.1424,1.1633,5.0364,2.766,0.9392,1.7495,2.8981,0.8242,2.5598,3.3705,0.6949,1.3927,4.6612,0.2664,1.9925,0.5993,5.9379,1.3796,0.0005,0.1714,2.9761,1.7629,3.393,3.2229,0.7649,0.6073,3.5486,3.615,3.5557,0.0361,3.3716,0.2691,0.4634,0.1616,0.0057,1.2884,0.0078,3.1483,0.4924,0.0191,0.0019,0.0006,0.8731,0.4661,0.0378,0.0073,0.0052,0.4682,0.0174,0.0024,2.7422,1.0258,0.3722,0.7554,0.5518,2.3182,0.0032,0.7103,2.8671,2.0447,3.3714,0.2548,5.2158,1.3786,2.0356,1.8616,3.189,0.682,0.5544,2.1347,0.3132,2.1053,2.5986,1.0737,1.4234,0.1149,0.1721,1.0217,1.947,7.6301,1.2387,6.1056,0.3623,0.2785,1.7588,0.1588,1.438,0.0011,2.192,0.0151,3.1698,0.7947,1.135,0.3218,3.8343,5.6093,4.7257,3.9015,2.2478,0.1939,1.9817,3.129,2.7969,3.4019,0.6197,3.3605,6.1246,5.6308,2.2333,0.3858,0.4191,1.2919,0.0001,4.0501,1.2201,3.4793,5.2444,1.9026,2.1448,6.1302,0.3078,2.9799,0.2431,0.33,0.4227,0.1537,2.5724,0.8431,3.1073,0.9169,3.8991,0.0696,3.3308,0.6986,1.5852,4.4588,0.5417,4.1716,1.7444,3.9957,3.3983,1.4741,1.5701,3.2883,0.464,4.6085,0.9283,1.5677,3.7089,1.594,0.9546,1.9353,3.6387,0.804,0.1534,0.1049,0.1801,0.3294,0.2733,3.655,5.2748,0.7841,0.0786,4.0203,1.6959,1.7429,3.5459,2.3447,0.7302,0.4693,2.2834,4.2977,0.163,2.058,2.4185,1.1776,3.1738,2.9351,0.1341,0.2396,0.0609,0.2305,0.3989,2.7835,8.8559,0.147,3.4764,0.0519,1.1776,1.0274,2.1489,2.8347,0.0121,5.9398,0.8639,0.5902,1.8235,0.0894,0.7855,0.3621,0.1704,0.0454,0.0121,0.0149,0.018,0.0515,0.3247,0.7233,0.0002,2.2724,3.7719,3.6241,3.3942,1.3407,3.1339,3.6096,1.299,7.7003,0.7802,0.2403,1.793,0.6958,4.2688,4.1937,0.7014,3.8315,1.5307,2.0057,4.7223,2.5394,1.5324,0.0193,1.752,0.0002,0.0002,0.3615,0.0009,1.2148,0.1631,3.495,1.3981,2.8932,5.6532,0.2601,0.3786,0.733,1.9099,0.132,0.515,0.8749,3.2066,0.571,0.0579,2.429,0.0438,0.0873,0.0145,0.0597,0.1727,3.6326,1.8278,2.6539,2.6677,1.3172,1.9544,5.0871,1.9129,2.081,0.3303,2.5104,1.6068,0.3456,2.7177,3.6952,1.6897,1.6373,3.8299,2.8109,2.1906,0.8982,2.7188,2.5662,4.592,3.3818,3.7089,3.1661,1.2977,0.4338,2.9396,0.446,2.0056,2.1748,0.2452,0.6582,0.0002,3.7644,1.592,2.2328,4.1601,1.0637,0.6471,3.737,0.1559,0.1064,2.6122,2.6635,1.7098,0.0009,0.0145,0.0077,0.0059,1.4799,0.8252,0.0002,0.3272,5.5574,0.586,0.0427,0.0479,2.16,0.0,0.0021,0.1227,0.1257,0.0054,0.0094,0.0004,0.8549,0.0025,0.0007,0.0119,0.0009,0.011,0.0001,0.0057,0.0024,0.0,0.0007,0.0579,0.0007,0.8499,0.0085,0.1048,0.0087,0.0009,0.0014,0.2236,0.1911,0.0001,5.4176,1.3769,3.5167,0.4032,0.0423,0.9833,0.0969,1.2105,1.3693,0.3841,2.192,3.7526,2.0866,2.8183,0.5078,0.027,2.7514,0.4752,0.3066,0.6951,5.0872,3.7786,4.0382,0.1185,1.7187,0.6188,0.3881,0.1125,2.708,2.1877,1.7139,3.5672,1.9803,2.4686,1.1885,1.1546,4.8389,4.7188,0.3233,4.8282,1.2582,1.9682,1.4248,0.6482,2.0472,0.679,5.1335,0.0211,5.6884,2.301,1.4691,0.5914,2.9132,1.0708,1.62,1.0248,5.0277,1.9052,2.6176,0.0995,2.4561,1.6798,3.3281,0.0517,0.7016,0.1412,2.4796,0.203,0.0253,4.921,2.1402,1.1765,1.7282,0.5698,0.9211,0.2255,0.9552,5.4564,2.9193,0.8531,2.6902,2.5804,1.0108,2.0051,5.1434,5.6933,2.2651,0.2674,0.6278,0.0002,3.5775,1.7946,0.5744,5.1697,0.6159,1.5407,4.6732,1.8941,1.0693,1.2065,0.9535,2.7302,0.2834,0.002,0.0099,0.0506,1.4926,2.7681,0.7228,0.8011,0.7147,1.5194,1.4823,1.1231,0.4638,1.5579,5.1714,0.805,5.7341,3.3754,3.5716,3.5288,2.2624,4.3103,2.4815,3.2771,0.3365,1.7264,0.1165,0.1229,0.0173,0.0075,0.0158,0.0223,0.1181,0.383,2.6315,2.1786,1.2913,1.0929,0.5803,3.8459,0.0844,2.6824,3.0505,6.173,0.1026,1.3865,2.4378,4.4338,2.008,0.2042,2.7163,5.4929,0.0078,3.9101,0.0087,0.411,1.7286,2.6755,0.4063]}
{"id":3598,"ended":false,"length":532,"gen_text":"Sandsfoot Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England, France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII. Traditionally the Crown had been the centre of worship in the local Roman Catholics community, who had been forced to leave because of the encroachment of the Protestant Reformation across the French kingdom, and to accommodate the growing Protestant population of the surrounding countryside. In 1638, after the outbreak of rebellion among the Catholics, Queen Catherine Howard of Argyle made a secret agreement with King Louis XIV where he agreed to pay the King's debts and grant the new ruler some land. The agreement was broken two years later with the outbreak of the French and Indian War, when Henry sent his troops to secure the lands of the Catholics. The Spanish Ambassador to England, Rodrigo Montesinos, was a firm believer in the idea of the sovereign realm, which was based loosely on the feudal systems of the European Middle Ages. He urged King and Queen Henry to build a castle, and to have it named Sandsfoot Palace.\n\nThe project cost some \u00a340,000. A stone wall was built, with a tower being added and the castle was declared a royal manor. Sandsfoot Castle was renamed Prince Charles County Palace when Charles was born in 1868. The new owner, Louis XII of France, declared the castle as public property in 1875, and then moved the residence of his son, King Louis XVI, to the manor. The castle remained in private ownership until 1952, when it was sold to a Roman Catholic couple as they had lost all three of their children to tuberculosis. Sandsfoot Castle was demolished and replaced by a five-storey, concrete block building, then a housing block. In 1986, a house and carpark were added, but in 1987 plans were drawn up to renovate the house to become a private home for a prominent Irish-American family. The family's name was suggested by a local architect, John Foy, who had previously planned the renovation of Sandsfoot House for John Foy, the late owner of the Castle, who had spent a number of years living in the house at the time of the proposal.\n\nThe owners of the property decided to sell the house and build a new home. The Irish-American family moved into the house and the castle was sold to a new owner in 1988, and subsequently became a stately home for the elderly owner, Mrs Margaret MacNamara, who died in 1998.\n\nThe castle now forms part of a community owned park. This site is accessible to the public free of charge from 6am to 4pm Monday to Saturday.\n\nThe Castle is on Google Street View and can be viewed here\n\nSandsfoot Castle is included in a select few listings on TripAdvisor, click here to visit\n\nThe Castle website can be purchased here","token_len":585,"entropy":[8.8406,9.8225,9.5954,4.1373,1.4514,3.5478,0.3068,9.9066,0.0418,7.717,3.108,1.6457,2.7611,3.0338,0.6184,0.4752,1.3617,2.4975,0.0286,0.1238,2.3038,0.2551,6.6306,0.4718,0.0097,0.0196,3.9548,0.0447,2.0318,1.3655,0.707,0.3882,9.2069,0.0306,2.1805,6.891,3.2587,1.1599,2.5665,4.5875,0.1308,6.2763,1.679,0.9202,4.5101,4.6263,5.1106,1.4018,0.9172,4.98,1.8982,2.0208,2.6806,0.3771,2.5907,4.2419,0.1766,0.8353,5.1044,0.5946,0.1154,0.8079,1.5845,0.8641,0.0146,5.8197,0.8998,5.8048,3.2104,2.8527,1.1816,3.5518,4.5092,0.6876,1.2632,2.5767,0.5036,1.4655,0.6877,2.9434,1.9581,0.2796,2.8441,2.6325,4.5418,0.789,3.4048,1.1529,5.5222,0.004,4.9821,4.5233,0.2872,2.5836,0.7703,5.1447,3.4914,2.2803,2.2838,1.1623,0.2595,2.6946,4.3069,1.3984,3.4245,1.273,0.0512,2.0908,2.0916,0.2219,8.1298,2.2907,1.9384,0.1118,3.6029,1.6228,3.9304,0.5416,1.8297,1.217,3.5925,1.6375,5.6319,4.9498,4.4148,1.5523,1.7466,1.7476,2.2879,0.7864,3.7585,3.9785,0.073,0.0067,4.3536,0.3516,2.5945,0.0022,0.6729,1.3905,1.7556,0.2845,0.1237,1.2275,2.425,2.4719,5.4176,1.4418,1.4639,0.4901,4.3568,0.5733,4.2223,1.1158,0.5083,1.7419,0.9599,1.6559,5.169,3.9056,1.1309,0.4088,0.7257,4.4016,4.6803,0.3478,0.3812,0.317,2.034,3.9898,5.8534,1.4818,0.3419,0.3169,3.7864,0.9997,1.8252,5.6094,5.9255,1.3599,2.9167,1.6344,3.1845,7.7526,0.3381,0.3185,3.6666,3.6432,0.4156,1.0036,3.5729,2.1644,0.0092,0.4163,1.2692,5.0911,1.9395,6.8096,0.5926,1.4928,0.3595,3.013,0.3681,1.3315,2.9171,1.768,2.9551,3.8256,0.9802,3.6834,3.4612,0.009,6.4522,0.7705,1.8868,0.0615,1.4027,4.4907,4.0886,4.2197,0.251,3.564,0.0391,0.0102,2.8514,3.3045,3.9648,2.6319,0.4858,1.2697,2.6124,2.2944,1.2184,3.4887,4.6764,1.7309,4.8978,1.5926,2.2525,1.6944,3.8168,0.6868,1.2871,3.4008,0.0242,1.2956,4.3223,0.0184,0.6487,0.5916,5.4196,6.137,2.2177,5.1621,3.3757,4.8007,2.275,1.8858,2.4717,1.0574,2.546,4.6884,0.3429,1.6817,4.1731,3.5123,1.2796,6.0492,4.8314,1.5921,0.1481,0.1387,5.8435,1.2534,0.5903,2.7306,6.2026,0.0473,2.4763,0.393,2.7147,1.1173,0.7374,5.0453,5.1217,1.5129,4.5822,1.0346,2.372,3.5215,0.8667,1.701,0.5851,2.1626,0.2952,0.4575,0.6906,4.8403,0.0025,0.769,1.672,2.0626,2.5094,0.6863,2.5284,0.9127,0.5255,5.1687,0.7403,0.0714,0.6035,0.1251,1.2642,0.3299,2.1842,5.4398,0.003,3.0918,5.3718,4.5264,2.8904,3.7444,2.8879,6.3926,0.2002,0.0159,0.534,1.0113,3.097,0.3976,4.4518,0.0087,0.5604,0.8351,3.8421,1.9308,1.6296,0.7613,0.645,5.5865,0.3666,0.3754,0.0004,3.9098,2.8338,1.3068,1.7335,1.6344,6.0659,2.0294,4.4079,1.8047,0.908,2.5017,3.6326,0.6362,2.5007,5.7126,3.2951,3.005,4.073,0.4774,1.5944,1.6998,2.419,2.4699,4.1284,5.9095,0.7572,2.3311,0.0541,0.5886,5.1297,0.0005,0.2281,3.4894,3.3678,2.8831,0.3529,3.6955,1.8698,1.3028,1.9845,4.879,4.6339,2.307,1.5734,0.9545,0.3751,1.599,3.6688,3.4422,2.8059,0.8456,5.3492,0.3899,2.0497,1.3601,3.4148,0.5424,3.1686,4.186,2.6201,0.5185,0.64,1.3351,2.7042,5.1532,1.7382,4.4054,0.0585,1.8063,0.0402,2.9356,2.749,4.3956,0.8539,0.2778,1.4985,1.867,3.9557,1.5427,0.3502,0.9106,2.2637,1.9521,2.1233,0.852,5.453,2.4751,2.7875,0.003,0.4097,1.3522,0.9227,0.6927,1.1899,4.3218,0.6824,0.2979,1.0613,0.951,4.0777,0.103,1.0035,0.0002,1.2039,5.371,1.4772,1.1317,1.8283,3.7725,0.5926,2.856,0.8816,1.0848,0.8326,4.0873,0.4522,0.7377,1.4484,2.6084,1.3739,5.5363,0.6557,0.1433,0.9951,4.1579,1.0498,0.3121,1.2152,1.7516,2.4018,3.4813,1.4175,2.6044,0.6809,1.3352,2.2719,0.567,1.5666,2.5579,1.502,2.7084,3.8399,4.0024,1.0522,5.0533,0.5701,0.1123,1.3716,0.914,5.0055,4.3785,1.5868,3.0099,3.748,4.5917,3.7934,0.5539,1.0472,0.892,2.177,0.1834,3.2492,0.1205,1.9063,0.0002,1.3954,2.11,3.6922,3.6917,0.3576,0.0036,1.8734,5.4555,3.6528,2.314,2.0737,4.6126,3.8442,0.8941,4.0322,1.7795,0.7639,0.1132,3.2655,0.0514,0.0023,3.3305,3.6865,0.68,0.4482,3.0247,0.2271,2.2431,0.0786,1.0951,1.1154,1.6336,0.0002,2.0542,2.2421,1.2963,3.8969,3.2584,2.2013,0.2765,2.1477,1.5373,0.1008,0.9598,1.8419,2.7222,0.0002,2.9575,0.0232,0.0166,0.3264,1.6558,6.4223,0.2244,3.2535,5.4848,3.9699,5.0596,1.0671,1.9617,0.6768,0.0008,2.2703,2.6964,0.1884,0.6811,2.6671,2.3343,0.0002,2.6255,1.4227,3.9339,1.7759,0.0411,5.9856,0.9967]}
{"id":3122,"ended":false,"length":542,"gen_text":"In 1998, the Ministry of Defence ( Mindef ) acquired the land containing the spring for the expansion of the nearby Sembawang Air Base, leaving F & N with less than 4 hectares of land over the spring in the center of Palembang. The Defence Ministry requested for more land in 2002, and the F & N Group was invited to submit proposals to expand the spring.\n\nThis project required new land with minimum interference from the environment due to the development of a new residential area. This required a thorough environmental study and the site could have remained under F & N's ownership for several years before the new project came up. The decision to buy the land was made in 2005 and the development began in June 2006. As for the initial findings, the Environmental Impact Certificate was issued on August 22, 2007:\n\nThe environmental impact assessment found that:\n\nThe potential development would have negligible effect on the environment.\n\nIt was determined that the required environmental impact, considering the proposed development, will be negligible, given there is no change in the local environment\n\nThe project could have been implemented at a lower cost and significantly reduced environmental impacts.\n\nThe evaluation found that the development will not cause impacts to the natural resources such as water, soil and air, but there might be some impacts where the new buildings might affect the local environment, e.g. by dust dispersal.\n\nThe impact is determined to be minimal, considering there are already two hotels and retail stores.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Palembang area in Johor is a good example as to how environmental impact can be avoided even if large-scale projects will only be temporary. F&N has developed a strategy using the concept of \"living with the land\". This means managing our footprint in harmony with the environment and with each other. One way we do this in the Palmembah region is with a community-based approach: F&N takes an ecologically-friendly approach that minimizes the environmental impact by considering how our actions affect our neighbours. Our communities are empowered and empowered people. In the communities, decisions related to community development are made by the whole community; residents, local government units, village councils and associations. Community land use planning meetings are held once a year to discuss how to resolve issues such as land use, forest protection and ecological balance. The F&N has worked with several communities to create a management environment that can be built upon, and now we are working with local government units to further empower the people in their communities. As a community owned company who has invested in community land use, we work for this in collaboration with the local governments and the public. F&N is on the frontline of promoting a sustainable, thriving eco-system for future generations.\n\nYou can read the full assessment of F & N's project by the Environmental Impact Assessment Office of Johor here","token_len":586,"entropy":[7.1038,0.2636,1.6686,6.9141,0.0915,2.9553,2.6034,16.255,0.075,0.2031,5.8998,1.4242,4.2762,7.5068,0.3926,10.1462,3.2569,1.2032,6.8741,0.047,0.714,5.3562,7.6433,1.8059,0.0327,0.0034,2.3041,1.2269,2.117,7.3582,7.6024,7.723,4.7859,2.9824,5.4757,0.4714,4.1941,1.2991,0.6719,0.7155,5.9242,1.4581,1.2903,4.0262,1.4366,5.1182,0.1247,6.3311,0.4262,0.001,0.4168,1.9398,5.793,0.8101,5.0872,3.941,3.8483,0.7494,2.1763,3.2799,0.9554,1.5897,1.5018,3.0423,0.1338,0.011,3.602,2.0469,4.5519,0.0975,0.954,2.1763,2.176,2.6515,0.315,1.9461,1.1387,1.3967,0.021,4.8282,2.5588,3.8348,4.575,3.2958,3.7123,5.3647,5.2062,1.5966,0.7408,3.8447,5.8176,0.0109,0.6351,4.1088,0.4728,2.0156,1.488,4.141,0.6636,1.3083,3.6201,3.1368,1.7577,4.818,1.9822,3.0692,1.7935,2.3862,5.3787,4.0972,3.5638,4.6977,3.6433,2.1705,0.0291,0.0071,0.6273,1.4204,2.3755,3.0411,1.1547,3.3182,0.9811,3.0409,2.3707,3.9366,1.4855,0.3376,2.029,4.8235,0.7623,3.4915,0.3861,0.3208,0.652,0.8656,1.0355,2.407,2.1157,0.7524,4.7412,1.8481,0.289,3.7647,1.225,0.1844,5.3122,4.8601,0.2893,5.7649,5.5396,0.6181,0.6788,5.0288,0.2089,7.7358,1.911,0.4615,1.9741,3.5256,3.3861,0.0761,1.2139,6.3121,0.7108,0.0002,1.3699,3.0586,0.5537,1.1126,3.6279,0.4883,4.0574,0.5553,0.0002,1.0139,5.0917,3.8866,2.8884,1.0879,3.6053,1.8588,0.0913,0.2343,2.1455,1.7334,0.3743,0.0002,3.7632,1.7501,3.0559,0.0695,0.5228,5.3648,2.2217,1.183,5.0392,3.9543,0.4018,3.4715,1.007,0.8059,3.7444,0.6912,1.6825,2.7244,3.2142,7.0863,1.172,0.623,4.1617,0.4551,0.3222,4.6267,1.5241,4.6687,0.0002,0.7336,2.5341,4.5146,2.1759,1.1169,3.2133,3.0703,0.6631,1.2991,0.1569,2.2166,5.6888,1.5778,2.3311,1.6614,1.0595,0.0746,0.0002,0.7963,5.2633,2.9297,0.3504,0.5652,2.4924,2.1664,1.0804,2.4061,5.6324,0.8695,0.6396,3.3496,3.0177,4.1205,0.0079,1.415,0.5404,1.6084,1.1508,1.1939,1.9992,3.7807,2.9104,3.0317,0.0246,1.2923,1.4653,6.5445,1.0074,4.1334,3.7179,3.6728,1.6457,0.4821,2.2865,0.9967,2.627,3.5745,0.0015,0.006,0.2213,2.4506,4.9,4.5963,0.037,0.7799,0.2745,0.0002,0.7952,5.1825,3.937,4.2606,0.2856,0.0493,1.7573,1.7607,1.6489,3.5091,1.5631,2.967,3.7527,3.4186,1.7056,6.1446,1.7309,3.9453,0.2161,0.0002,5.4852,0.2273,0.0002,1.1226,3.8755,0.0058,0.001,4.7272,3.4668,4.3398,0.0066,0.7344,1.6872,4.2436,1.3316,5.5993,0.3932,0.8101,3.8332,1.8527,1.5151,0.146,4.6576,4.6472,1.98,5.2301,1.2192,0.0059,2.2763,5.226,5.6422,1.3981,4.0829,0.4569,3.3535,3.0372,0.0105,2.3491,3.6541,1.0773,5.2388,5.8521,1.7993,4.5668,0.0487,1.6551,5.7545,1.8468,1.1675,1.3399,1.9658,1.759,2.5161,5.6592,4.56,4.6848,2.5408,4.6165,0.0556,0.4916,1.3717,1.243,3.6747,3.4586,0.074,0.3455,5.8335,2.7427,2.1357,1.254,0.1469,4.44,1.6407,1.7201,13.2116,6.0449,3.5645,0.0832,3.4206,2.4614,4.4574,1.3442,0.9022,1.6101,3.8887,2.9991,0.154,0.001,5.0527,2.6987,6.8486,0.0412,1.5612,1.8319,0.206,3.9689,3.5164,0.1112,1.4125,2.1489,0.3021,3.5473,5.2627,3.5017,1.9908,2.3282,1.3251,2.3432,0.9092,1.0784,3.5203,5.0121,1.0463,5.2065,2.4529,2.4795,5.4957,2.0623,3.9731,1.8434,6.128,0.736,5.5897,5.9828,0.0053,4.4337,0.9199,0.4188,0.7083,1.3389,0.6232,4.6154,0.2222,4.1846,5.3568,2.1045,3.0638,1.7472,3.067,0.5936,5.4882,0.4837,0.8097,5.0649,0.5998,3.9187,4.6044,1.5271,1.0455,4.2148,0.4117,0.4785,2.9282,0.5464,0.3176,1.9887,0.9411,3.402,1.056,5.8206,1.5892,2.5239,0.0029,1.8968,0.7226,0.8601,5.365,2.0357,0.8407,5.2363,3.1697,0.2731,2.4714,2.0343,0.1291,0.0011,5.2981,3.4043,0.8431,3.8554,1.8552,1.1244,3.2877,1.6699,5.7498,6.2393,0.7799,4.2059,1.9949,5.2382,0.7089,2.722,1.7396,5.7814,1.542,0.6451,1.5815,0.537,3.0943,1.3386,0.6565,0.601,4.3861,4.0209,1.7205,2.0776,1.9358,2.0091,1.6302,0.5827,4.7594,1.4209,3.4112,4.0201,1.4802,7.6617,1.6129,3.97,1.4728,3.4259,1.9823,0.6532,2.1542,0.7124,4.3683,4.3894,5.9016,4.1792,3.4638,0.03,1.083,0.7694,2.6621,1.4553,1.99,4.1349,0.4742,3.3064,0.0284,0.0006,1.4689,5.4956,0.7422,3.0666,0.6129,5.2856,2.6611,0.7315,3.2717,4.9565,2.9996,0.0202,0.4561,2.6061,3.0081,0.0061,0.4075,0.7525,0.0002,5.2436,0.2457,1.1324,1.4301,0.9953,3.7264,2.6757,3.1552,1.041,0.0152,0.5285,2.6916,3.2584,0.6614,1.574,0.0722,0.0952,3.1884,1.3396,0.7109,0.0046,1.9999]}
{"id":4508,"ended":true,"length":524,"gen_text":"Typhoon Cimaron struck the Philippines with winds estimated at 195 km \/ h ( 120 mph ) and gusts in excess of 230 km \/ h ( 145 mph ). Along coastal Aurora Province, where over one million people live, the Cimaron killed at least 10 people and injured another 20.\n\n\nThe powerful typhoon was expected to move through the South China Sea, where a number of major tourist resorts are located, on June 10. About 60 million people live in Cebu, Leyte, and Samar, and most of Cebu is already devastated from the May 12 earthquake.\n\nAerial images taken yesterday (June 9) from the Philippines show the devastation of the epicenter; one kilometer (0.62 mi) wide, with a diameter twice that of a football field, the eye of Typhoon Cimaron still visible inside it. Although the winds in the storm have decreased significantly over the past several hours, it remains a category 4 storm with 150 km\/h (93 mph) winds and an estimated maximum sustained winds north of 180 km \/ h (112 mph).\n\nAs of midnight on Sunday, the wind pattern was forecast to be on a westerly track, which would reduce its maximum sustained winds to about 110 km \/ (68 mph) during the day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) said. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) forecasted the typhoon to become a tropical storm by 6 pm today (Monday, June 10), passing east of Palawan on Monday night, and moving out over the southern Philippines, possibly to the north-west of Leyte Island.\n\nAt that time, the storm will have sustained winds near 155 km \/ h (95 mph), and the pressure should be increasing at the surface; typhoons are usually very unstable at the moment of landfall and could even turn around, said Paul Thomas, head of forecasting at JTWC.\n\nThe center will update the typhoon's intensity at 6 pm Monday morning, and it is likely that it will be downgraded during that time. The typhoon is forecast to weaken, or not develop into a typhoon, before the early morning of Tuesday, June 11, if winds do not increase appreciably over the next 24 hours, possibly becoming a tropical depression. The typhoon is currently located about 120 kilometers (75 miles) northwest of Cebu, the Philippines.\n\nEven if the typhoon were to become a tropical depression today, the typhoon is expected to move through the Philippines again during the early morning of June 12, bringing heavy rain and powerful winds. Rainfall accumulation could be on the order of 3 to 5 centimeters, the JTWC said. Typhoon Cimaron has already left at least 10 dead, including one person who was killed by falling debris from a building.","token_len":586,"entropy":[4.4814,0.3355,7.4093,6.9501,10.2817,6.0376,1.0359,1.8221,2.5153,1.5624,4.5306,0.4591,4.1025,1.6277,6.0768,0.5977,2.0761,7.8258,0.1565,2.5134,1.656,0.6184,0.062,4.3583,0.0086,0.0057,2.7208,0.0371,0.0522,0.0081,0.1549,3.8504,0.0065,0.7852,7.5048,6.42,13.2914,1.9886,0.5359,3.8614,5.3124,3.6587,0.512,0.3861,0.4694,0.2019,1.3551,5.8603,0.0304,0.1289,3.7511,1.0607,0.0038,3.3445,0.5288,0.6945,0.7112,3.281,3.6063,0.7977,4.0587,0.0004,1.781,5.5086,0.9896,0.0009,2.3126,2.4979,0.0049,2.0117,4.0104,0.6265,2.7748,0.0175,0.0129,2.046,2.2377,3.3982,2.0475,0.0036,5.3193,5.8872,2.0581,0.6841,0.0919,0.6514,3.0325,6.9181,3.2031,0.7962,5.8989,3.9519,1.8098,0.8014,0.5737,0.4117,4.2716,0.1743,0.0,0.8811,2.2072,0.0,0.3892,0.9807,0.3735,1.6649,2.1683,4.1574,0.5872,4.7528,0.0024,0.0004,1.9736,3.3045,5.5615,3.0077,0.7964,4.0665,4.021,1.6706,0.5846,2.4263,0.0002,3.594,3.8496,2.6336,2.7274,4.6539,2.2665,0.5007,2.0559,0.1147,3.1174,1.2201,2.3523,2.2988,1.2477,1.5673,2.5171,0.7958,6.0244,0.0955,6.4486,4.7882,5.7729,0.0119,1.4895,0.1175,0.0016,0.6735,2.7618,0.1402,1.0365,1.3457,2.828,1.565,2.1414,7.9244,0.7638,0.4262,1.6292,0.4171,0.0425,1.1773,1.089,3.2984,0.4573,2.9533,0.0618,0.002,0.1196,5.2433,2.7439,5.812,2.8294,0.1913,6.0362,0.9273,4.398,3.6725,0.3945,2.042,1.8291,2.5267,2.7829,3.4644,0.1918,0.569,3.0193,1.3693,0.0628,2.1948,2.4916,0.6454,3.5424,1.3344,1.3965,0.9727,5.6367,0.8102,1.4318,0.1472,0.1597,0.4051,0.0122,0.0587,0.4309,1.6264,4.8554,0.9747,2.0934,0.0744,0.8672,7.5101,0.016,2.3303,0.0408,2.1422,0.0432,0.0543,0.6343,0.0093,0.2374,0.8219,0.0003,3.7036,0.6746,5.5016,2.0756,3.4769,0.8816,1.3189,5.5729,6.17,2.0478,4.3186,0.0116,4.1881,5.2006,1.2109,2.3205,0.0009,0.0002,0.4827,1.0329,2.3845,1.5349,4.8829,3.0402,2.5628,0.2002,0.064,0.5607,2.1401,2.0823,0.1041,0.3802,4.922,1.1064,0.0215,0.6183,4.0684,0.1645,1.0537,1.5517,4.4256,2.8697,0.0005,0.0008,0.0297,1.1355,0.0054,0.0008,0.0001,0.0238,0.6432,0.2375,2.143,5.3692,0.6564,0.2755,0.007,0.0067,0.2571,0.0057,0.002,0.0234,0.0034,0.305,2.2362,0.0508,0.0039,0.138,1.8946,2.7266,1.9143,1.329,0.0003,0.8559,3.7742,0.1476,1.2854,0.7828,1.3576,3.8929,2.9913,3.9665,1.0934,2.1637,0.7808,0.0148,0.0425,1.0004,5.1653,3.5154,0.2417,3.1677,0.0246,3.0754,1.1149,1.0666,1.5818,0.5671,2.2923,3.7152,2.7152,0.1839,3.2749,1.1165,3.3043,2.3533,3.4035,0.9021,2.0316,2.3952,2.1922,1.6843,3.2604,0.0002,1.7356,0.7948,0.5778,0.0003,3.9067,3.1572,0.6133,0.075,0.8569,1.3655,2.6181,2.0208,2.9796,0.0528,2.0376,3.1315,0.09,0.3069,0.2123,0.0354,1.3393,0.0112,0.8233,1.7028,2.4478,6.1953,4.3112,1.2084,5.3359,4.5837,1.5017,1.8379,5.175,3.9925,0.5031,1.4136,2.5433,3.9543,1.9062,1.5509,1.5454,2.767,0.5845,0.8317,2.5848,4.0572,5.3385,2.5138,1.9494,2.4335,4.5689,4.7987,3.4325,0.14,2.9149,0.0247,4.256,0.6373,2.4274,0.0055,0.0003,0.0604,0.6575,0.0003,1.9337,4.099,5.5143,2.5188,0.62,1.1572,0.0013,0.3775,2.9539,2.9374,2.5089,0.6974,2.1084,3.6436,1.1158,1.2492,2.4588,1.3253,1.8616,1.8974,1.587,0.1203,1.4585,1.1029,0.0004,6.1071,2.7862,0.4198,0.7705,2.2164,1.7779,0.001,1.3516,2.4094,0.0216,2.0316,5.0616,3.7549,6.3943,4.0246,1.2337,0.0484,1.528,0.0,0.2522,3.5179,2.897,3.7715,1.1425,1.5897,0.8991,0.3448,0.2694,0.0103,1.0913,4.4648,2.9522,3.2729,0.0765,0.7007,4.6981,0.0031,3.308,0.0466,0.1935,1.1414,0.2784,1.5802,5.6496,3.6063,0.2293,1.2285,0.4002,1.0474,3.0052,1.6438,0.0004,1.0709,4.3951,2.1476,0.553,4.4866,2.3256,0.1603,0.2183,0.1597,0.0116,3.1491,0.0178,1.6045,0.065,0.0,1.3008,2.7625,1.7431,0.5685,0.3019,0.0002,5.9643,1.4029,0.6089,0.7054,0.0002,3.4502,0.0548,1.5644,0.0532,0.434,0.102,4.4008,0.2098,1.8476,2.8768,0.0033,2.0244,0.6489,0.0093,3.4107,2.835,0.4495,1.8753,1.7546,2.5747,0.2898,1.7031,0.6938,0.4531,1.4007,0.4239,0.5476,3.5243,1.6998,0.8151,0.68,3.7207,0.2799,1.0544,4.2557,0.2609,6.1502,2.6132,2.4407,5.3744,0.0172,0.0383,0.005,2.578,0.5134,1.073,1.3858,3.3712,2.7923,1.5198,0.0026,0.0003,0.2644,0.3375,4.023,0.2742,0.0032,0.0415,2.5614,0.6995,3.6026,2.6223,0.0013,2.0099,1.227,1.5545,2.0809,2.9446,1.3354,0.7747,1.2523,1.0795,0.8539,0.6492,0.9174,1.9368,0.5409,2.7717,1.0374]}
{"id":3890,"ended":true,"length":547,"gen_text":"Both species sleep in round nests up to 50 cm ( 20 in ) across made of interlaced lianas, branches, leaves, and twigs gathered from nearby trees and woven using the mouth and jaws of the adults in nesting. The nests are generally made of leaves woven to form a single tube with a diameter of about 5 cm across and the sides, and the roof, cut into a spiral of interconnecting lianas.\nWith the exception of some species of lembas and the eastern hairy-nosed lory, no species of Lark eats insects that can be found only in the wild. All larks have a complex sensory apparatus inside their upper mandibles. To the extent that they can see or hear objects, these are used to locate small organisms such as insects, which are captured or placed in feeding sites. Lark flight activity shows considerable change in the breeding season, with more active larks showing an even heavier increase in movements during the breeding season compared to the nonbreeding season. As part of their search for prey, larks use a type of call made by clicking the moustache hairs in their throat, called a call. The call is a sharp click that is accompanied by a series of short, high notes. This is repeated when the prey enters the nest site where the prey is quickly pulled into the nest by the adult which will then hold it with the mandibles.\nThe call is used to warn other larks nearby of the approaching prey. The noise is particularly common where the prey is in a group and is audible over a considerable distance. As the adult walks over the nest, the prey will come out into view and he will click his moustache hairs once more, just before holding the prey in the nest. The noise is audible over a considerable distance but seems to be reduced by a thick layer of foliage, a phenomenon called echo. Unlike other mammals, most larks are unable to hear or see low-frequency sounds that occur at frequencies below 1 kHz over a short distance. This means that the noise emitted by these species when trying to catch prey is not audible during daylight hours. The difference in hearing between larks, which have ears set far back on their heads, and some of the carnivores (which have ears set forward on their heads) has sometimes been described as being comparable to that between a rock and a piece of cheese.\nLarks are among the most active of all birds, often spending long periods flying over their prey and following closely behind it over grassland or forests. A lark with enough body movement can usually keep some of its prey in sight, however, and can follow it by running on top of it when on the ground, and so has more time to take the better catch. The only time a lark may be seen flying over a prey without taking it is when hunting large rabbits or young birds.","token_len":587,"entropy":[9.7284,8.8442,1.6238,8.3775,3.6909,7.2556,0.047,3.8682,0.7382,1.652,8.15,0.3875,1.4636,2.5634,7.844,0.4216,5.8721,2.8978,0.2833,7.7613,1.091,0.0022,1.9594,5.0621,0.7449,1.8033,0.7294,1.4652,1.8941,0.0018,8.2238,1.1587,3.5904,0.5652,1.5565,11.0758,6.4983,2.2512,7.6459,2.0228,4.1593,0.3254,0.7363,4.1007,4.8281,5.7147,1.341,1.6215,1.3888,0.3783,4.2944,2.0764,0.628,2.9504,6.3058,3.7862,1.2976,0.4332,4.2169,3.8575,2.1904,0.9931,2.1045,0.1373,1.3873,2.5093,0.3072,8.5279,2.0207,3.4174,4.3344,4.5562,3.1713,1.9206,3.9566,0.8921,5.7463,2.1966,2.2739,3.6113,3.4697,2.5693,4.5053,0.0227,2.4981,0.0757,0.0016,0.6206,2.5605,9.8783,1.1314,0.8387,0.003,3.3548,1.8264,1.1553,5.3063,5.3519,0.5162,1.9166,3.6219,5.6014,5.0941,0.4434,1.2242,0.0476,3.8365,3.2605,0.4378,3.4125,2.7532,0.2623,4.5409,3.9756,5.4772,1.9098,5.1362,3.6456,0.6443,1.5334,3.5477,0.7108,0.8847,3.292,0.4898,3.695,2.4407,0.5782,2.6783,1.2008,5.1215,4.9365,1.2583,6.3671,0.4239,5.2491,3.3346,0.0989,2.5568,5.1733,3.3164,3.6045,0.1103,1.267,1.2719,1.9222,2.7594,0.7481,6.3712,0.9496,2.7301,1.1381,2.6935,0.9743,1.4041,5.2248,5.2937,2.8092,0.0018,0.5539,1.1458,3.6354,1.2231,4.6801,3.9582,5.3538,0.4554,6.7986,3.6863,0.8707,2.4276,1.6715,5.3196,6.1903,6.8372,3.9356,6.2831,1.9942,1.3271,1.4719,0.0815,1.0879,1.3658,3.6149,2.2753,5.0107,0.0517,2.9738,3.5488,5.1067,5.464,2.2456,0.2363,6.2208,1.711,0.5697,1.7465,0.3452,2.1966,0.6004,1.1872,0.7707,0.6722,0.2929,0.2067,4.8481,4.9027,0.0014,0.8587,3.591,0.1776,1.514,0.1865,0.8529,0.0213,2.8297,1.7561,4.7969,0.0022,5.1125,4.5434,0.3081,3.3751,2.1655,4.2919,5.5756,0.3161,1.534,3.1492,1.211,3.8705,2.2744,3.381,1.4473,3.9095,1.2747,1.6927,0.866,0.8273,2.2817,4.6802,4.2747,2.1339,1.2524,4.2609,0.0141,0.6072,2.3626,0.0022,2.06,1.5936,1.6659,5.1025,1.0088,2.5027,2.0554,2.394,5.3004,0.4892,1.1382,5.3425,0.3473,1.7095,2.8706,4.5702,0.5659,3.7645,0.2907,5.1233,5.8452,1.3519,0.3382,1.4319,1.587,0.2271,3.3813,6.773,3.7491,1.2703,3.8077,0.557,3.625,1.7528,3.1945,0.1513,1.1556,2.1829,1.7185,4.3013,1.2218,2.4935,0.7362,2.9246,0.8,0.9517,0.0095,3.5461,0.6935,0.2573,2.9242,0.2159,0.8575,1.8456,5.5216,1.4321,4.6912,5.8862,5.3901,1.6525,0.7908,0.3112,2.7832,1.5886,3.0407,2.0267,2.1016,4.301,2.9006,0.4134,1.6662,0.1027,0.2161,4.344,1.4865,4.2401,5.9979,3.3039,0.6848,2.2282,1.4424,0.6942,2.9989,2.3605,5.0735,2.3153,3.6918,0.4566,0.9841,5.6009,0.7092,3.312,1.8558,1.6736,0.0011,0.0134,0.4927,3.8482,0.7479,1.7811,5.2236,0.5041,4.954,0.7239,0.0943,1.3248,1.5482,1.1197,0.5515,1.4735,3.9436,1.4612,4.1192,2.018,0.3212,0.6655,0.0179,3.7235,5.9714,0.1267,0.6789,4.1193,2.131,3.0404,4.172,0.7138,0.0052,3.7989,2.8564,3.6957,4.1059,1.904,3.342,1.616,6.485,1.9691,4.3113,0.3202,3.8577,0.6291,0.0213,1.9636,2.9748,0.004,1.0504,2.8831,0.6897,4.1235,0.3519,0.108,0.3614,3.4669,2.3518,1.5307,1.3939,0.5139,3.3018,0.7202,7.3916,0.9839,4.0801,0.2432,0.3839,2.221,1.8749,0.0989,2.0294,2.4668,2.2409,0.1741,4.0267,3.3861,3.8904,5.2078,0.0026,1.5471,0.7897,0.6261,2.2709,1.3031,6.678,3.624,0.2297,0.6185,2.5382,5.8771,0.4635,1.6623,0.9773,1.4205,0.0322,4.4007,2.1042,1.7159,5.1073,5.388,2.5256,0.7283,0.713,0.4856,0.4101,0.4719,0.0622,3.9385,2.5727,0.4136,5.1702,0.7004,2.67,3.3385,0.4318,0.5594,0.742,2.8784,0.7439,0.176,0.1105,0.3098,2.3085,6.7244,0.2934,2.8837,0.0518,1.4848,1.932,0.0544,0.8129,0.7873,0.9281,5.136,0.1962,0.1691,3.0574,0.0009,4.5389,0.1947,0.7524,1.4916,0.4888,1.152,4.6439,0.0407,1.0074,3.9241,1.1724,1.0027,0.9855,1.1886,3.672,2.2096,3.4554,0.1284,2.931,2.2119,1.7598,3.1011,2.7082,4.5601,4.3984,0.5995,2.0441,6.545,6.2194,1.1835,1.7711,3.4924,0.2848,4.6051,2.8917,0.0044,4.7662,6.6048,6.5452,4.1652,1.2732,4.3155,2.3776,7.9689,1.7057,0.5268,2.5915,0.661,0.5081,2.4015,4.5637,0.888,1.6196,2.6419,3.3524,1.7629,4.2182,4.0349,3.4755,2.7765,0.0279,0.4767,4.5425,4.6722,0.3392,0.635,2.6008,2.2925,5.7037,3.8772,5.4151,3.4736,0.1764,3.7381,2.6472,6.8397,5.006,0.2551,2.4094,5.0953,3.1644,1.8036,0.2722,0.0018,3.2145,2.1989,1.5896,1.4929,2.268,1.7836,1.0079,2.4294,2.4794,0.6818,0.4809,0.3913,3.2578,4.6076,4.8495,1.4247,5.4121,2.2967,0.727]}
{"id":2669,"ended":true,"length":513,"gen_text":"Le Tr\u00e9sor De Rackham Le Rouge began serialisation as a daily strip in Le Soir from 19 February 1943. The title of the new adventure had been announced in an advertisement in the newspaper, and its main feature was the capture of the German leader. The strip ran to four-and-a half pages, and also contained a cover illustration.\nAn interesting feature of the strip was that the German military commander had been identified as General von Klaustrein before his capture and thus the French had not yet been able to name him, and this gave them an important advantage in identifying him.\nAlthough Le Tr\u00e9sor De Rackham Le Rouge was intended as a one-off comic strip, Le Soir ran Le Rouge at least twice a week, with a weekly edition on 9 December 1942 followed by a larger two-page strip on the following Monday. Le Soir also published a number of stories with the title Le Rouge, which included the first 'capture' and led to the introduction of the name 'Siegheil' and the capture of a second German commander.\nLe Rouge appeared twice a week throughout the war, with a separate feature on the Friday before publication. As the strip ran longer, however, it became necessary to adapt it when it was translated into French. On 14 May 1944, one of the German leaders was revealed to be Captain Von Schwarze. He had escaped from the Redoubt near Paris on 15 December 1942, and by 9 June had been found by French soldiers. The capture of Captain Schwarze led to a two-page series called Le Rouge: Le Fran\u00e7ais au Chateau du Rh\u00f4ne, and he died in captivity the very next day.\nLe Tr\u00e9sor De Rackham Le Rouge continued on the French front as a continuous two-page strip at least until January 1945 when the war was won. The strip resumed as a single strip with the capture of General Friedrich Paulus on 14 March 2005.\nLe Tr\u00e9sor De Rackham Le Rouge was also licensed in the UK for one-off comic book releases, beginning with a comic by Paul Clements and Alastair Reynolds published by Bizarre Creations Magazine on 25 September 1939. Two additional strips were published between 1943 and 1945, one of them by Paul Clements and Alastair Reynolds, and one of them by John Gillis and Alastair Reynolds.\nLe Tr\u00e9sor De Rackham Le Rouge has often been considered one of the founding fathers of the World War 2 superhero genre, possibly because of its success and because of it's repeated appearances in the popular comic strip of 1941, The War Doctor. However, the character was invented by John Gillis and Alastair Reynolds of Doctor Who fame (who co-wrote the stories with Clements), and was created for the British television series (not Doctor Who) based on them in 1970.","token_len":587,"entropy":[9.0849,1.2674,0.0212,6.8737,15.3224,1.3176,6.7724,8.1703,13.0574,9.565,3.3088,3.1874,0.8964,5.8551,4.765,0.2597,3.8781,3.6532,0.0002,4.6317,4.9098,2.6849,4.8619,1.2015,1.4295,3.3627,2.3149,0.1824,7.5153,8.0736,5.4464,0.8382,3.5955,1.2858,3.4423,3.3932,0.583,0.9528,2.2387,2.2609,1.3324,4.1242,3.9896,3.4199,0.3535,1.3186,4.3222,0.1889,1.6637,3.7801,4.4301,2.2663,1.2827,0.7739,2.7802,3.5233,3.8509,4.1921,0.1078,0.002,0.0274,4.9444,1.233,1.0387,1.0152,5.7473,1.8184,1.2767,5.2298,2.2105,2.2255,1.6654,10.0545,4.0104,1.1914,0.2514,0.6652,0.2823,0.3304,1.1372,1.5232,4.3879,4.9278,2.68,3.2207,1.1773,4.3553,1.091,2.6346,2.0932,4.421,4.4036,1.9728,1.4087,1.3253,6.2841,2.414,0.1507,3.2529,5.0373,2.1285,3.9275,2.413,3.1218,2.8965,2.3419,0.8467,0.0059,3.0604,0.4816,3.0747,2.0465,2.9609,3.9933,3.322,1.3565,4.6362,0.3851,0.9596,3.6411,1.0359,1.6452,1.3669,4.8912,1.3474,0.8111,0.002,0.0004,0.0701,0.0421,0.0022,0.3214,0.0045,0.9501,4.0649,1.3248,0.2814,5.083,0.037,0.2408,3.0883,0.5008,0.248,3.5535,0.7235,0.0,3.265,5.6189,1.2694,4.1631,0.6347,1.3334,0.9303,0.2356,2.067,2.43,2.0351,3.9467,3.36,1.9928,4.6691,3.3639,2.6833,7.0154,0.0856,0.6533,6.2843,4.6443,0.0568,0.1616,2.6608,0.4958,2.2628,1.265,1.2057,0.3515,2.6548,0.5002,0.0002,1.3921,1.8693,1.0167,2.5905,0.0022,3.9479,4.0555,1.2886,1.9279,1.0104,0.3224,1.75,2.1965,3.6359,1.6693,3.2203,5.7761,3.847,0.475,0.3149,3.6694,6.6637,0.3302,0.7558,3.3802,0.0436,0.6637,3.7287,1.0299,5.195,1.2852,8.2991,0.956,0.6504,3.7231,0.8772,5.2604,0.0478,2.2858,2.0297,0.8199,2.1545,0.7208,0.7141,0.9458,1.8458,3.4844,4.5057,0.8411,0.0669,3.9345,0.5676,1.5228,0.6038,1.9825,1.513,5.5051,5.7195,1.0993,1.1695,3.5595,1.8187,2.5089,0.6895,4.4572,1.5108,1.7425,2.7312,4.3895,1.8948,5.5108,0.017,1.507,1.5347,1.5688,0.0925,4.9693,0.7255,6.54,2.0147,1.1092,4.5554,0.3049,2.2291,1.0161,3.6766,3.5557,2.5393,1.395,0.5878,5.735,0.8659,0.2629,4.2708,2.6723,0.5492,4.6614,1.2981,0.0688,4.4406,4.9271,5.3462,1.8555,2.1573,3.4316,1.8167,4.2126,0.7307,1.5892,5.3406,2.2889,3.2309,4.0584,1.2949,3.8201,3.0244,2.1789,0.9213,0.7625,3.6698,4.5672,1.473,1.253,1.4099,3.7973,1.4367,1.9084,2.7434,1.4111,2.1957,4.1868,0.6522,1.913,0.2753,0.0006,2.8711,0.1075,2.0294,4.3251,0.0374,0.0711,5.7045,4.0002,0.3697,0.5683,3.5353,1.8567,5.4328,0.008,4.8476,4.1485,1.282,0.0898,3.3315,3.0162,0.9214,0.0007,1.8517,2.289,4.2981,6.9065,1.1001,1.0449,3.8216,5.2146,0.2995,0.1055,0.1285,0.5542,0.8066,2.197,0.0056,0.0002,0.0526,0.0509,0.0012,0.0555,0.0024,2.0031,3.6783,1.1814,4.8417,3.807,3.6695,0.6669,6.1499,4.7423,0.0373,0.087,0.1867,5.1883,0.8034,0.3765,4.5067,0.47,3.0251,1.2448,1.8377,1.6376,2.6261,0.572,1.7718,1.2039,3.8769,2.4883,0.267,2.6318,1.8069,3.1249,1.1284,3.2659,0.0581,1.4072,4.8265,2.299,0.1678,1.5216,3.7631,2.3951,7.2554,0.4423,0.7778,1.2541,0.9951,0.0079,0.0002,0.0339,0.0257,0.0009,0.0493,0.0021,1.2139,2.9585,5.4171,1.5181,1.38,1.2052,2.3203,4.2595,2.6127,0.2087,2.3803,3.4468,2.9324,1.4978,3.7019,1.1017,1.7716,3.6161,4.3678,4.5884,4.4206,3.3451,0.5922,4.7234,2.1342,0.0003,1.2585,2.054,0.8825,4.4405,4.5714,2.4806,0.0001,7.34,2.3615,3.4459,2.52,3.7857,0.3145,5.43,3.6603,2.5457,1.0299,0.8507,3.5021,4.2132,0.0712,0.6617,0.8887,1.9793,2.1622,2.341,1.8009,2.4047,0.1611,0.0035,0.3181,0.5232,0.0074,0.0005,0.0181,1.1897,1.2599,2.1679,1.0072,0.1005,0.149,3.5117,5.5687,2.8185,0.4816,1.7525,0.0595,0.0001,0.0286,0.2831,1.028,1.2029,0.2834,0.0094,0.0001,0.0192,0.0209,0.0008,0.0294,0.0013,3.5108,3.9605,0.0314,3.2454,2.052,0.0048,0.0538,6.5881,1.6901,0.0093,0.5101,4.6979,0.0175,3.2645,4.1327,0.3729,0.9402,6.341,2.5621,0.5666,0.7262,4.6018,1.8194,2.1708,0.7683,5.1469,0.7179,5.7314,2.1393,0.4675,1.2166,3.5664,1.8121,1.8578,1.8667,5.7595,1.7346,2.7527,2.4952,5.9164,0.9699,3.2534,0.0716,1.8417,2.2994,1.5247,5.5636,0.676,3.8246,0.2004,0.0128,0.959,0.1812,0.0047,0.0004,0.0167,4.6249,3.0365,0.0148,0.1798,4.0312,1.713,4.0301,0.0035,0.7087,0.6995,3.2336,1.1866,2.331,0.0008,2.4302,0.3639,1.9672,2.8014,2.0232,1.0733,3.6571,2.5036,0.7494,4.6266,3.2655,2.7805,0.0015,0.6988,6.0383,0.1479,6.3677,2.2265,4.7122,0.21]}
{"id":4772,"ended":true,"length":547,"gen_text":"In Stanley Kubrick's 1968 science fiction film 2001 : A Space Odyssey, astronaut David Bowman slowly disassembles the mind of an artificial intelligence named HAL by sequentially unplugging its memory banks. Carr's team is interested in using the same approach to manipulate the brain.\n\nBut what happens when you accidentally make the program think that its body is the true mind of the AI? The answer: Your brain gets into trouble.\n\n\"It really is surprising how much harm it does [to the brain], just by using your brain on computer,\" he said. \"We're trying to give animals what we're thinking of giving humans.\" As we're learning more about how the brain functions, and the potential dangers of doing so on a mass scale, we've seen our attention span\u2014and our ability to concentrate for extended periods of time\u2014diminish, making us less productive in the classroom and workplace. One brain-related consequence is that adults can't learn as effectively from a book and study more than two hours at a time, research has found. Other studies suggest that studying at night or while on the subway takes its toll on our attention, as we're less able to focus on a task.\n\nThese effects are real\u2014in one study, researchers induced a state of distraction called \"altered visual attention\" in young adults by placing them in a darkened room for two hours, with only a dim light. They found that while their brains functioned normally, their performance fell on a test that gauges attentional skills.\n\nAnd in a 2013 study, rats with electrodes implanted in their visual cortex that respond to external stimuli were able to perform better than untreated rats on a task that requires them to focus on a specific stimulus and ignore the rest of the world. That's in line with what I've experienced myself at my day job, when the task of focusing on a single website for a few hours is challenging, to say the least.\n\nThe challenge is that the brain is not a computer. It's a set of cells that have evolved to carry out tasks when you are awake, and it responds differently to external stimuli. Computer simulations have shown that it's possible to replace the human visual cortex with a similarly-shaped silicon area and turn the rat's brain into an \"attentional area,\" meaning that the animals' actions would no longer be subject to computer-based control, allowing them to focus on a task that requires a different level of attention.\n\nBut to achieve this, we need to recreate the biological design of the brain\u2014something we, as a species, haven't accomplished in about 15,000 years.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about this research, check out this lecture from the TED Conference : How Do Humans Learn? And a very interesting paper on the cognitive neuroscience of the visual cortex by Daniel Kish and Thomas A. Banks.","token_len":587,"entropy":[11.6503,0.5158,0.0509,3.5242,4.6925,0.3304,1.1202,1.3718,5.922,0.024,0.0043,0.002,0.3868,3.3654,1.4526,0.0025,8.4215,7.4975,0.6538,0.0003,1.6476,7.4755,0.2526,2.0963,4.4778,0.0688,2.2515,0.0047,6.1424,7.976,0.4085,7.617,1.05,0.0004,1.3716,4.8666,0.6534,0.8472,11.6442,2.0956,3.8494,2.304,4.5843,0.0887,2.8879,1.503,0.2943,1.3599,0.4332,5.3115,1.0149,2.0189,1.1698,0.7733,0.0011,4.1425,3.7729,2.4871,0.5452,1.7887,5.1138,5.0821,1.8759,6.3189,1.8349,1.8227,2.8922,4.5852,0.2628,3.3258,6.0594,4.7407,1.5841,0.6084,2.1959,0.2763,3.0374,2.5458,2.9298,4.4509,1.2563,2.5958,5.5399,2.0344,0.2006,0.2994,0.0002,1.5491,2.5263,5.3075,1.3428,4.9849,0.6531,1.5172,6.3489,2.9122,2.0722,6.2525,0.6613,0.4665,0.4169,2.0613,3.8781,1.241,4.9828,3.6835,1.6724,5.4462,6.6271,0.3566,4.2226,0.6291,0.1,1.0077,2.579,1.7041,2.2367,0.0336,5.3849,5.7595,4.5996,1.0351,3.5997,2.9672,1.5171,0.6099,0.9301,1.1702,8.4152,4.0427,3.6992,2.2175,0.5889,0.1354,1.4053,0.7836,0.323,2.9164,0.2429,3.2849,2.5547,2.8153,2.7027,0.6151,5.3427,0.5736,3.5345,0.439,4.2842,0.0289,0.0457,3.0489,3.9301,3.1614,5.5537,5.721,0.8435,6.2467,0.9213,0.9902,0.9928,0.0168,3.3972,3.4795,2.1193,0.0226,0.2007,0.0008,0.0488,1.0901,0.0906,0.0046,2.5725,4.2394,1.356,1.0518,1.1542,2.7946,0.9587,3.6492,1.0729,3.2889,0.1771,5.4471,5.7738,0.7879,4.0824,3.5522,1.5047,1.8441,5.633,2.9543,1.8032,3.3291,0.8588,3.1162,3.1448,2.2269,2.3211,4.8337,3.2017,2.5639,1.7055,2.7534,1.0314,1.8225,0.041,0.1108,1.6302,5.3113,0.7996,1.2588,0.0625,5.025,2.1167,1.8916,0.2124,5.7317,3.4118,0.8053,2.6106,2.9445,3.2549,1.2977,3.3586,6.3785,3.0812,0.0039,0.8831,1.014,2.3341,2.5351,2.5295,1.5182,1.3754,0.5361,1.2698,0.0061,1.4533,0.9233,1.567,0.6089,1.0296,0.5664,0.0003,5.038,2.5236,1.1763,4.1964,3.1845,3.5539,2.4279,0.6896,0.2302,1.9614,5.8687,1.4113,2.9976,0.0795,4.5173,2.6087,0.7502,5.6569,0.0743,3.2225,0.1125,0.3202,0.2644,4.1465,0.9789,1.0161,4.0008,1.3829,0.1905,0.9318,2.132,0.1246,2.554,2.839,0.3766,2.0004,3.683,3.0847,0.9875,1.8181,1.0188,1.9414,2.0279,0.536,0.0918,4.1568,3.141,2.9755,4.7193,0.0008,0.1279,0.3557,1.6238,1.5819,5.0389,3.8518,1.1947,1.6773,1.8727,2.4116,0.2794,1.6398,2.9123,2.3632,0.5377,1.1352,0.0003,3.9159,3.4099,1.5619,3.0739,0.2457,0.5131,6.104,3.1971,2.6786,0.3626,0.2131,0.1097,5.4007,0.1866,5.5506,4.4418,0.2064,6.1844,0.7489,1.8613,2.1052,0.0039,2.3654,1.1531,2.2642,3.4119,0.6507,0.8939,0.418,1.1548,0.5402,2.1892,1.0768,0.0036,2.6157,0.3758,0.5587,2.9511,2.9977,3.0552,0.6192,2.6242,0.7025,0.5648,0.0894,1.2935,0.2735,4.1409,1.494,4.522,1.4836,0.0022,1.7964,6.5781,1.0441,2.1567,2.35,5.0269,2.6607,2.3082,0.0167,1.3341,2.6047,3.0255,3.7921,0.88,3.3465,0.3056,0.6422,1.92,6.4513,2.7531,1.9575,1.2455,1.8173,2.648,4.101,1.8346,3.2958,0.0153,0.0037,0.0052,0.0927,0.4987,0.0002,2.7213,4.0718,1.471,0.9571,2.0906,1.1867,1.0934,2.6152,1.3918,1.7617,1.1337,1.2045,0.8359,0.8408,5.9787,0.0036,3.7433,1.0807,2.9724,0.5125,0.7506,4.6976,0.0695,3.2063,6.3194,3.8478,3.1012,0.3157,1.0923,1.4193,2.5125,4.3984,1.8529,0.7381,4.2744,0.1478,1.8459,5.9417,2.7561,2.8941,1.2653,0.1354,2.3119,0.9551,0.5456,0.0457,5.5103,1.5254,3.2948,2.5475,0.1015,0.1715,0.5906,6.3649,2.3217,3.1714,3.7179,6.0606,2.6621,5.1666,1.909,1.5321,1.3018,1.6629,0.0723,2.1382,3.025,2.5482,0.0672,0.2744,5.8475,0.8988,4.1506,0.8403,1.4683,2.8023,2.913,6.188,1.0304,4.1782,0.0045,0.5947,4.7462,0.0043,4.9716,1.3485,1.7442,2.3433,1.6514,4.0836,0.4218,0.0235,1.2977,0.7143,1.3738,0.7852,4.4524,1.2301,2.9032,3.1391,2.734,0.0015,1.5968,0.3436,0.6249,0.0002,1.7861,3.8975,3.2109,0.6811,0.8952,2.4915,1.6545,0.312,5.6021,0.5104,4.5881,5.4547,0.133,0.1741,0.9012,2.8093,3.3949,2.3889,7.0789,0.951,0.6226,0.429,0.0126,2.0091,0.0004,3.1621,1.7107,4.4019,3.9211,0.6842,0.0015,0.0074,0.1971,1.2814,0.0002,4.8914,1.6922,4.3753,1.9384,0.033,1.4524,0.072,0.1029,2.1164,1.631,0.2281,2.5524,0.0123,1.6685,4.5035,1.593,1.5929,3.2092,2.3202,8.0093,3.7253,4.8996,4.0631,2.1254,0.5692,3.8922,4.4255,5.5828,1.5983,2.0646,1.7742,0.7575,4.7709,1.27,0.1197,2.6514,3.7571,0.5433,2.3763,4.5483,3.8949,0.4966,1.4503,5.5767,4.606,0.1083,4.8878,1.5088]}
{"id":4195,"ended":false,"length":541,"gen_text":"Fossett competed in and completed premier endurance sports events, including the 1 @, @ 165 @ - @ mile ( 1 @, @ 875 km ) Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, and the North Face Endurance Challenge (NHEC).\nIt was while he was competing in NHEC in 2002 that he learned about the problems facing those chasing the dream.\n' I was living a pretty comfortable life but there were definitely those times where I thought about giving [running] up and giving up on my life. 'He said. \u00a0'When I saw people at that race that had been training so hard for this race that were just getting discouraged with what their bodies were telling them and were taking their lives, I knew I had to take a step back, see what was going on, and figure out what I wanted to do with my life.'\nFossett's training schedule in the years immediately following this was less than ideal, but it began to change from time to time.\n'I had to realize that there are so many people out there that are working really, really hard that are just not having a good time doing it.'I was also able to meet other competitive runners from around the world. \u00a0In 2003, Fossett and fellow skier and endurance athlete Mike Ward began their own running series through the San Francisco Bay Area, which was so successful that they began to launch races across the U.S.\nIn 2004, Fossett began to coach the San Francisco Marathon runners on short runs and timed runs in preparation for the race. \u00a0In 2005, he became the head coach of the United States Ski and Snowboard team and he has since become an accomplished coach in both endurance and hill climb sports. \u00a0He is currently on the staff of the Pueblo Cross Country State Ski and Snowboard Association. 'The biggest influence [on me] as a runner has been the people in the sport,' he said. 'It is one of those things where you will work with somebody for a little while and it just builds so many good friendships. 'I feel like [being a coach] is really an amazing way for me to help people not just run for themselves, but help people get better at running and at the running itself,' he added. 'I do it as part of my job and I guess it's a little bit like writing.'\nFossett now coaches at the Mount Diablo Cross Country Team, but he will return to running to give coaching sessions for the UCI Mountain Bike Championship in January 2014 and the Olympic Track Trials in March 2014.\nSo, for this month's Runners of the Month \u00a0series run by Runnersworld.com, Fossett has been given the honor of choosing the runners that he thinks are doing the best job for their sport within the current season.\nRead the full entry from Fossett here","token_len":587,"entropy":[7.4079,7.5734,11.8345,0.5654,5.8949,7.332,13.3064,7.6784,4.9286,1.6038,1.8055,0.4273,0.4428,5.6597,13.347,9.1278,9.5516,11.4121,6.783,7.2766,7.1596,5.5856,2.9804,8.0003,2.7575,0.8758,0.926,5.4692,5.3065,4.1149,1.1874,10.686,0.0986,0.0001,1.678,0.1088,0.0049,0.0897,0.2227,1.1713,2.2721,0.3508,4.9375,1.6289,0.8596,0.337,2.5377,4.8881,0.0913,1.0903,1.4846,8.1073,0.8972,3.9967,2.9415,0.0815,1.8983,0.2653,2.2583,0.0022,1.6643,3.2894,0.2854,1.5966,3.4299,1.4865,1.0462,6.0055,3.6803,5.3034,5.9594,1.0183,3.7116,1.5589,1.1626,4.9207,3.9263,1.5602,4.8016,3.3054,2.7459,4.0034,0.2817,4.7414,3.6093,0.9158,4.2845,5.2886,2.1567,1.338,0.3694,2.3123,2.0608,2.3375,7.825,2.693,0.0357,0.2603,3.0058,3.3608,0.5053,0.869,1.62,1.6148,1.5265,1.6847,5.5449,2.287,2.2876,5.2303,0.0102,0.8771,3.9912,0.4081,3.5359,3.6498,4.6832,3.5061,2.3403,2.7384,1.8073,1.8941,3.6567,4.2205,0.1161,1.1713,3.1767,1.2333,2.9609,1.5405,2.9569,3.4221,3.6083,3.8608,2.9658,4.2575,1.2734,0.3391,0.5066,0.0057,2.2694,2.6206,5.4098,1.6548,0.7843,1.3157,0.7997,2.3773,1.2675,0.457,0.0452,3.3838,1.1819,1.7636,0.0832,3.4885,5.3436,0.7801,1.4772,0.5621,0.0166,1.0405,0.2367,2.1157,0.0613,0.8195,0.393,1.6141,0.0632,0.0298,0.8335,0.0513,0.032,0.697,0.4834,1.6451,0.0107,0.0025,2.326,4.2785,3.3251,3.7082,2.0955,3.1823,3.8768,0.4766,4.7762,3.5666,4.7582,0.6783,0.6063,1.6885,1.1823,2.3455,5.3786,0.114,1.1106,5.2923,2.8907,0.0216,0.0003,0.429,1.119,0.4507,1.5304,2.674,1.8797,4.3848,0.3723,3.2533,1.9855,2.8798,0.0059,1.7173,0.6829,0.0236,0.8039,0.9644,3.6955,2.2844,2.7626,0.0115,0.0387,3.7176,1.2395,1.6726,1.2606,4.4364,2.2192,0.7604,0.3566,3.0352,0.3452,2.1168,10.0938,2.5122,4.7037,4.1481,0.0069,3.7719,2.7426,5.8925,0.9043,4.2919,1.1681,0.0302,0.6603,2.2935,1.7462,0.0002,4.463,2.6257,0.7105,7.5307,0.003,3.0191,3.4724,6.09,0.186,2.0808,2.2039,0.3129,4.0718,4.5339,3.436,4.2032,1.6047,2.0268,4.8337,5.4074,0.9869,5.0871,0.7002,1.053,0.3451,2.0944,2.6078,2.7164,5.2966,0.2354,0.4376,0.8472,2.7152,1.7156,5.0294,3.4651,2.9106,0.1484,2.5898,0.0015,0.0079,0.1929,1.3972,2.5314,1.0098,0.1687,0.2551,0.0014,2.6055,1.4815,5.6524,2.5241,3.694,0.27,1.4881,5.4509,3.845,6.9578,2.8874,1.6586,4.6371,0.8337,2.9272,1.6581,0.0303,0.2763,2.6886,0.2899,1.2893,0.0003,2.5083,0.7318,0.1524,0.8465,3.0016,0.7017,2.2981,0.1583,0.6555,0.2114,5.2311,0.0687,2.1891,2.5499,0.0186,0.0309,1.9674,1.9046,4.1889,2.4086,2.1495,3.1036,2.3623,3.7529,0.7032,2.2025,2.8126,3.3008,1.0869,5.7174,2.4367,1.2811,0.2341,1.5718,0.0003,1.5949,1.9584,1.7785,4.0457,0.2951,2.601,0.5208,0.5336,6.2071,4.3085,0.0182,5.294,0.1707,5.983,4.5447,2.3141,0.0907,0.0765,1.1719,1.1013,3.9539,3.0669,3.0583,5.0475,5.0499,0.7246,1.771,0.4172,3.5096,0.1468,2.0429,1.3984,0.1518,1.7728,2.0315,3.3359,0.975,1.0948,1.7705,0.9807,0.272,0.06,0.5051,2.4991,2.5132,4.2082,0.2236,1.6015,0.8182,0.8312,0.8804,5.504,4.8345,0.6874,2.77,1.2531,1.0288,3.3593,0.4219,0.398,3.0694,2.6872,3.6847,4.3016,3.085,1.3928,2.9591,1.1217,2.6838,1.4657,3.8774,0.6578,4.8972,3.0876,0.3849,0.14,0.0755,1.0441,3.3217,3.5294,2.5345,2.0277,2.3769,0.4207,0.0103,2.9459,0.8643,5.5434,1.7067,3.9961,3.6183,1.3007,0.7834,0.0535,2.845,1.7527,3.0426,1.9446,1.5373,1.3838,1.5658,4.0583,3.191,4.2032,3.4818,4.7036,0.2899,1.2508,0.0435,1.6641,1.2755,4.6303,2.4973,3.3209,5.1161,0.0186,0.6364,0.7458,1.5825,0.9068,5.9394,1.4716,0.9586,1.7082,2.1951,0.6126,1.1988,5.3839,2.527,0.7875,1.1763,0.0048,0.0017,4.7241,2.1868,3.3714,1.1134,5.8937,0.7657,1.3032,0.0584,3.4144,1.845,3.4751,0.8892,4.1335,4.0138,0.0845,2.6418,3.6291,4.4744,3.2213,3.6762,2.136,0.9684,5.6727,1.0312,1.6,0.9417,5.6133,1.1929,2.9078,4.0576,3.0779,0.7717,4.0681,3.1476,1.9743,0.2269,2.2317,0.5579,0.1212,1.3282,5.8548,1.472,5.0064,4.7877,3.6817,0.5592,3.9623,0.9596,3.2123,0.5156,1.8321,5.3529,0.0018,5.2115,8.3349,0.1988,2.3764,0.2716,2.9348,0.6739,0.0531,0.3822,4.9151,0.003,1.6533,0.5054,4.3362,0.2218,1.5627,0.256,4.7239,1.0303,2.4655,2.7147,1.7792,1.6807,1.3799,2.3216,0.4984,0.4501,1.5249,3.6787,0.8961,1.1098,6.3605,0.7003,2.2759,2.2288,0.1831,1.282,4.9999,1.4675,1.0148,4.4214,3.1623,1.159,0.0023,1.1731]}
{"id":1341,"ended":true,"length":516,"gen_text":"A successful generalist predator, the cougar will eat any animal it can catch, from insects to large ungulates ( over 500 kg ). Like all cats, it is an obligate carnivore.\n\nIt was in the year 1510 that Sir Walter Raleigh crossed the border between England and Canada with his crew and captured the rare Canadian cougar.\n\nThey hunted several time, but could not capture the cat on the first two days.\n\nThat's when the group set up a trap to catch them using a large stone on a pole.\n\nThe small dog then led the charge and the four men shot it with arrows. The cougar then jumped down into the pit and the dog picked it up and led it back to Sir Walter.\n\nBy this time the cougar cat was very tired and weak.\n\nSir Walter told him to drop the dog, and with a bow shot the cougar's neck. The cat died instantly.\n\nThe animal and the dog were brought back to England, and there Sir Walter described the animal to Charles I, and he got his license for killing it.\n\nAfter that the cat disappeared.\n\nBut when Sir Walter wrote about cougars he did not mention that they are classified as carnivores, but there were no mention of a cat in 1510.\n\nIt has been thought that the two cougar cats were kept together in captivity. But now we know that Sir Walter was the first European author to mention a cat in Europe.\n\n\nHe had seen a wolf cat in England. The two were later mixed together.\n\nSir Walter Raleigh also described one in Virginia, and described it as a black cat with a large red spot on its back.\n\nIt is presumed that this cat is the American striped cat I've been reading about. One is the size of a house cat, but has black mane that extends to the top of its head.\n\nAnother photo of the striped cat\n\nThe striped cat found its way to the USA in 1830 where it was sold to an African breeder, who named it Kinyimi.\n\nOver the next few decades, Kinyimi was bred from one to two individuals and the white tabby cat became the rarer form with the red spot.\n\nWhen you're not fighting off the cougar, why not try eating some wild boars or squirrels for dinner and try eating a pangolin for dinner too?\n\nThe only problem with pangolin is that it's not easy to kill with a spear.\n\nAfter some studies, it was found that the pangolin's scales become almost transparent if it is attacked on the back, and so it can be killed without the need for a spear.\n\nSo this means, all you can do is shoot the scales off and there's nothing you can eat.","token_len":587,"entropy":[8.3628,8.0669,6.0769,8.9221,2.3969,1.5002,5.1434,0.0097,2.6843,2.7917,3.2391,1.7172,1.7622,0.3999,0.7875,1.0045,2.4072,4.6263,0.2965,3.245,5.0533,0.0006,0.0088,3.0518,13.1155,3.9878,2.0808,2.5486,5.1138,2.1688,2.1939,0.1413,1.8185,1.2596,2.8584,5.2781,0.0048,0.6862,0.0062,1.6135,1.4827,0.0798,4.35,4.151,4.7958,0.7645,5.5742,2.5421,4.2343,0.592,3.9655,1.5253,0.0223,5.1907,0.1744,5.2946,2.3839,2.7768,0.0215,3.1317,2.779,1.6026,3.9361,1.8427,2.4994,1.8278,5.1856,3.7039,1.2479,0.0111,1.0085,2.4561,0.0002,4.7234,5.0095,6.3666,6.422,1.8867,0.4825,3.4583,0.6115,1.7517,1.136,2.9643,4.5575,1.522,1.3613,3.1822,5.1334,0.559,1.6525,0.0002,5.3223,1.7236,0.5081,1.7013,5.1301,3.6351,0.7785,0.9402,1.2605,3.0333,1.0484,3.7017,5.9957,0.9308,3.019,2.7985,3.5601,1.0618,1.9384,0.5924,0.6499,0.0002,1.3411,5.9468,4.6285,4.1828,4.1187,0.4701,5.9793,1.7122,2.0306,5.3172,1.0812,3.7856,1.1727,1.5723,1.7868,0.6308,2.3338,1.1993,0.0107,2.8994,3.0018,2.6494,2.3177,0.1311,2.0678,0.8122,2.4762,1.6169,5.4151,0.1376,0.0194,1.3121,3.3682,0.2964,1.5076,0.3462,3.5249,0.0248,0.4972,0.1907,0.0002,5.2305,1.9171,0.0672,1.3183,2.2083,0.0078,7.429,0.8108,2.8223,2.056,0.5445,2.5556,1.1357,1.181,0.0002,2.0306,0.0145,4.2878,3.8171,0.5545,5.6161,1.2727,1.4799,1.9847,1.5432,5.4621,1.4794,3.6894,5.0658,0.725,0.8482,0.0015,4.0151,3.7819,0.8379,1.5943,1.6963,1.9444,1.3122,0.4663,0.1979,0.0002,1.4286,3.2705,6.0891,0.9143,0.5726,0.3063,3.2637,0.4486,0.1132,0.4014,1.6887,0.8568,5.4785,2.0885,0.0144,4.4033,0.3751,2.4566,2.3997,5.3122,1.4047,1.589,2.5037,2.5911,4.6469,3.6564,3.5985,1.7574,2.9609,2.6475,0.3132,0.1963,0.0002,3.912,1.571,1.7276,1.6971,4.6509,2.1512,0.5303,0.0001,3.7202,3.7045,1.1033,0.0681,5.1819,1.0266,5.2658,0.1926,2.6952,3.0017,0.1624,1.5754,1.4819,2.0131,2.0375,4.4196,0.1047,2.7915,0.0649,1.7092,1.8981,5.3917,2.4087,3.0942,5.6411,0.2429,2.903,1.3072,1.645,4.4356,0.5997,0.534,0.254,0.0002,3.0498,3.4718,0.2831,3.6385,0.2054,0.8107,5.5999,2.7754,0.6829,1.1439,1.3675,4.668,2.6464,1.6143,1.9131,1.8218,2.4168,3.4433,2.0936,0.257,0.2759,3.4912,0.0169,2.3116,1.5162,0.3774,4.2442,5.5046,0.2386,1.6194,1.1583,1.2341,1.1723,3.6986,0.3371,4.4219,0.0005,5.3035,3.7307,3.2129,1.5868,6.0521,3.1196,0.9629,3.6219,2.4852,2.8046,3.7255,2.2529,4.0965,5.1009,2.1334,1.7658,0.7404,0.0002,2.4848,0.0423,1.2791,2.3651,2.2031,5.0314,2.7428,4.0468,1.3152,1.6528,3.9281,2.0521,0.355,0.7881,3.4412,0.6215,0.7675,0.8256,3.7505,2.9848,0.7137,0.3859,0.4158,1.1756,0.314,0.5154,0.0002,2.4812,1.7741,5.6974,0.1212,1.8242,0.9918,2.8782,0.5111,4.7793,6.6291,0.1924,7.83,2.9588,1.2598,3.3465,0.0618,1.1582,7.0224,4.6348,2.937,4.9935,0.0269,0.1605,2.2991,0.0743,0.6852,1.7151,2.2971,3.6423,4.9502,0.3156,5.0793,3.1476,1.4379,0.6003,2.9677,0.0462,0.2127,0.5043,0.2753,0.7122,0.0002,3.4618,5.5343,1.0875,1.2135,1.1986,0.0724,2.8166,0.0002,1.8063,1.1326,0.0742,5.665,2.3258,0.0783,0.4259,1.5768,3.5617,1.3916,6.2304,4.8485,0.2865,0.9729,4.7376,0.6611,2.7743,4.0372,6.5044,0.0,2.5637,1.2899,2.1035,0.2331,4.5582,5.217,6.1951,0.3617,0.4543,0.0002,6.005,0.4421,1.2219,1.3486,1.2585,1.4068,1.1059,0.0012,0.012,1.3165,2.0419,4.3348,4.7697,1.8862,2.5179,4.679,2.3712,2.8531,4.7954,3.3992,0.0026,2.4244,2.1401,1.2634,4.76,2.2252,3.511,4.3887,1.2596,2.1053,0.4334,0.4002,0.2054,0.0002,4.3115,5.0682,4.3718,3.7731,5.1615,2.7957,2.5694,1.5331,0.7239,0.9681,3.7961,0.4065,3.223,3.8142,1.7244,3.2616,2.7106,3.7313,2.6203,3.6043,0.0251,4.2606,1.022,5.4022,4.5665,3.4344,1.6618,4.9079,2.4532,0.0011,1.82,1.997,1.6582,1.0738,0.5959,0.0002,2.7,4.2629,1.4987,1.4879,2.475,0.0049,1.6096,0.2571,0.3235,1.4488,1.1765,2.041,2.9437,0.0766,2.755,3.3794,0.5117,1.5688,0.8042,1.1182,0.0002,5.653,4.2666,5.1489,0.9369,1.4673,0.8242,1.1412,0.1141,1.3585,0.7501,0.0045,0.0518,1.7554,3.7805,5.9126,5.1932,2.1716,4.5677,1.6202,0.7463,4.9532,4.5537,0.4014,2.0123,2.0766,1.2464,3.513,1.5908,2.651,0.7536,2.183,3.8358,2.3662,1.2794,0.8329,0.4947,0.1339,0.1809,0.1944,0.0002,2.7893,4.5039,2.823,3.3328,6.0013,0.4007,4.5385,0.2369,0.4008,3.1973,1.969,2.0662,1.5927,2.2151,5.2529,1.1331,1.34,1.2735,0.0837,4.8757,0.8474]}
{"id":1845,"ended":true,"length":527,"gen_text":"A Mesolithic hunter @ - @ gatherer site dating to the 7th millennium BC at An Corran in < unk > is one of the oldest archaeological sites in Scotland. Its occupation is probably associated with the early presence in the area of Neolithic people who followed suit to occupy these grasslands. In this site, < unk > is the site for the earliest known human occupation of a grassland, but other recent discoveries include stone flint tools from the early 5th millennium and burials of children.\n\nIt is a very high carbon dioxide area, so at times of low carbon dioxide levels the plants do not survive well. The carbon dioxide levels will rise rapidly with more weather and the potential for more rainfall, making the area more suitable for grass. If there is rainfall the soil will soak it up faster and it will dry. As a soil profile shows, grasses will do best under low carbon dioxide.\n\nAt An Corran, grass is the dominant vegetation and the grasses can be seen on both sides of the route.\n\nWhat is interesting about An Corran is that the vegetation is very tall and very narrow, the difference in height being about 0.1metres. The broad grasses, like the ones of the Cairngorms are very wide. These taller grasses are more resistant to herbicides than the narrower grasslands (trees).\n\nThe grass is very dense, but the lower parts are loose and the grasses are more resistant to frost than the higher areas. It makes perfect sense because if there is frost as there is in summer then the grass will freeze up and you will get less food and fewer food animals.\n\nIt is not necessary to have a view to the north or south of you, so in areas of this high carbon dioxide area there is little need to leave the car, we can easily walk across the landscape to see what is around us.\n\nThe grass will be taller at An Corran, because there will be more rain. The grass will be wider and wider, and with longer grass it will be tough for herbicides to penetrate into grass areas.\n\nThe top of the grassland will look like this.\n\nOn some of the sites, grasses have been disturbed by human activity. Sometimes the original vegetation is not found after the disturbance. On The Hairy Heifer one of the old grassland areas is still there, but a new grassland has arisen to the west of it. The grassland over this area is not disturbed by humans. On this site, the grasslands are quite new, not standing in the way of the new grassland.\n\nThe vegetation is very large and quite dense so it can be difficult to see for cars. The grasses are very tall and compact. It can be easier to see the areas that have been disturbed by human activity.","token_len":587,"entropy":[11.7156,4.3564,4.0833,11.9897,7.8666,5.7115,6.7653,5.8825,1.184,6.5386,7.0015,0.8295,2.4373,4.9798,0.1291,0.7878,0.4456,3.622,6.2231,10.1171,3.779,3.5015,9.5168,9.2413,1.9545,1.446,7.4157,4.4009,0.0877,0.5191,2.1797,4.1616,0.2043,0.5165,4.8222,0.8251,4.5125,5.215,1.6682,5.5789,3.4837,0.0375,0.4687,3.3511,5.3154,3.5184,1.2615,1.1853,0.0421,2.7963,0.0049,3.086,2.199,4.4233,6.2746,3.5526,5.5591,4.6481,5.0412,1.3524,0.7215,3.9908,2.0101,2.5979,1.135,5.1526,0.544,0.0138,0.0157,2.641,2.5108,2.4357,3.0362,1.083,3.3568,2.2268,3.1048,1.9199,1.2181,3.4678,2.1464,0.1155,2.1837,4.2343,4.1767,4.772,2.9172,3.44,4.5473,4.1854,0.6811,1.2835,1.8222,0.7604,2.6702,4.5598,0.0165,0.12,3.4831,5.7449,0.023,1.6961,4.3949,2.8962,2.2442,0.0708,5.0046,0.7009,2.7246,2.7925,5.8097,5.2717,2.5334,1.6381,1.3306,2.2297,5.5604,2.2541,1.1138,1.5407,2.8546,0.0384,0.6931,1.9799,3.4419,3.5779,0.3723,3.2151,3.2333,0.8649,2.069,4.0435,0.1836,1.4429,4.8159,1.5713,4.5543,3.7694,5.3808,5.467,2.0954,2.0621,6.1378,0.397,2.1901,4.4297,2.1009,4.2302,1.1374,1.6694,1.0093,0.4902,0.2067,1.9162,2.776,4.5446,2.4801,0.4607,5.5616,2.1079,3.4841,0.9612,3.6413,1.5692,0.5245,5.0583,1.1298,2.7652,0.4173,4.6786,4.6569,4.1797,1.6464,7.1994,5.0758,4.4762,0.5496,3.89,1.6856,2.3451,4.8367,2.7703,2.8816,1.9265,0.6469,0.0028,2.7862,0.9642,0.0002,4.0214,2.5806,0.0194,0.0019,0.8654,2.8119,2.2889,2.9253,0.6397,0.694,1.9663,1.6941,3.3039,0.7797,4.0093,0.7656,1.4356,2.7914,3.5936,0.212,0.0336,0.076,5.8665,1.1222,2.349,0.0002,5.2881,1.2836,3.412,1.323,1.1542,0.0055,0.0008,0.1283,0.2468,1.5903,3.7936,0.956,2.1945,5.3721,1.1124,2.9085,4.0192,1.325,3.8472,5.1915,1.8018,0.4664,2.4445,2.246,4.3089,0.0082,3.0126,5.5848,0.1954,0.6313,1.9544,6.1737,1.5737,1.3858,3.5194,3.6329,1.4849,2.2325,4.9989,1.7714,4.651,0.2064,0.0537,0.002,0.0848,2.8249,2.1369,2.9189,1.9807,3.67,6.2081,0.14,0.0336,1.0077,3.5798,2.9095,0.0464,5.4717,0.6272,2.3317,0.4041,1.8047,0.2584,5.9578,5.2744,5.3558,0.2709,1.5904,1.106,0.0002,1.5595,1.9252,2.681,1.8448,2.9481,1.5272,2.5973,2.0344,5.1642,2.4275,1.0851,5.3132,0.5771,2.8153,1.3902,1.1379,0.9965,3.8784,4.0771,0.0364,4.5112,1.3844,0.3283,1.1978,2.7785,0.3514,3.2089,5.7176,4.9551,0.2579,4.4299,2.9813,2.2658,0.3265,1.37,7.175,1.7361,1.1549,1.0126,3.258,2.708,0.6564,0.3219,1.8602,2.7374,4.7202,1.0159,4.4821,1.0585,2.44,3.7382,2.542,3.6132,3.1404,5.9926,2.4117,0.4094,0.8354,0.0002,3.4642,0.4598,2.8752,6.1337,0.2186,1.9377,0.9671,5.6037,1.6058,4.5533,2.6271,1.6797,0.3492,1.221,5.7011,2.1265,3.6893,4.3916,4.5761,2.0563,5.3955,4.4506,1.1858,0.0077,1.8105,2.9751,0.6848,3.376,1.7382,0.4996,4.5268,1.0868,0.938,2.4646,5.1088,1.4285,4.3486,1.3648,3.6786,0.839,3.0379,2.9705,1.919,2.2932,0.6398,2.7848,0.4404,0.2108,0.6861,0.0002,1.9122,2.1018,4.7316,1.9263,4.1804,3.041,2.0932,0.0061,0.0006,1.64,2.9693,2.3372,3.4715,0.0685,0.472,2.2611,1.6108,1.8945,1.245,1.4063,0.9573,2.1318,1.7467,3.1228,1.6308,2.0802,5.0384,4.4796,0.3353,3.9653,0.336,0.5987,5.9625,1.4899,1.9236,0.1432,0.2166,1.5534,3.0127,5.4779,2.7465,0.4092,0.7886,0.0002,1.6668,5.2352,1.5028,0.3527,0.7593,1.4297,2.3357,4.004,0.8334,1.0251,1.4736,0.633,0.0002,4.4209,4.9031,1.5006,0.1297,4.192,1.6112,3.0178,1.1868,1.6878,0.6952,3.2707,1.3443,2.5998,0.4531,1.4098,4.6965,1.866,6.2538,1.9472,1.5414,3.0308,3.2655,3.696,1.4782,1.1027,0.9938,3.9555,7.2777,5.04,3.3147,5.8131,3.0446,6.4837,0.7319,0.077,4.8716,0.8683,2.387,2.1385,1.5915,2.1077,1.9104,0.7895,0.311,3.6474,2.0389,0.7377,0.2429,0.5238,4.8055,4.0663,0.3126,2.3336,1.1242,0.6375,0.2665,2.3961,1.4402,1.9987,6.051,2.1506,0.5904,0.882,3.0796,3.7739,1.1328,1.6787,1.4238,4.2311,2.5258,0.3447,1.1836,1.1101,0.8264,3.6912,0.7945,3.6937,5.4522,1.2485,4.1858,5.5836,3.8084,0.8033,2.3404,0.1105,1.3754,3.264,0.3392,0.6157,0.9895,0.5752,0.0002,1.6885,3.7281,1.5723,1.6024,5.1197,1.1432,4.2149,1.779,4.5619,1.309,2.9268,0.7105,0.8626,0.2221,1.6604,6.0339,3.7971,0.9748,1.9656,1.3902,1.3568,0.717,1.6609,0.6098,0.7602,6.069,1.6986,2.8542,2.6445,0.2314,5.3031,0.1337,0.7378,1.4826,4.9498,1.9238,0.9982,0.3214,0.131,0.7321,0.9341,0.1108,0.7956]}
{"id":4561,"ended":true,"length":450,"gen_text":"The 47 prefectures of Japan each have a flag resembling the national flag insofar as consisting of a symbol, called a mon, charged on a monocolored field ( with the exception of Ehime, where it has a design consisting entirely of black and white rectangles).\n\nThe primary purpose of flags is to show the administrative jurisdiction and authority to conduct a certain law in a territory.\n\nThis could be done on the basis of the territorial and administrative boundaries of each prefecture and its principal city or to show the administrative jurisdiction and authority to conduct a certain law in a territory. The most interesting prefectures for this reason are Asakura, Chino-ku, Fukushima, Fujisawa, Kofu, Kawai, Kita, Kanazawa, Kagoshima, Kanagawa, Kochi, Kobe, Miyazaki, Niigata, Toyama, Wakayama, Kanagawa, Kita, Kurashiki, Yamagata, and Tokushima.\n\nIn Asakura, there are prefectures and municipalities under the responsibility of the prefectural governments while in Chino-ku there are prefectures and municipalities under the responsibility of the prefectural governments.\n\nAnother reason for displaying the national flag is that it is very convenient for communication of policy in the case of the various prefectures, which lack public transport, having only a limited number of subway lines. This is why we often see the national flag at stations of rail lines in prefectures which lack a subway system.\n\nWhen a prefecture as such is annexed or demarcated by another country, like for example after the Meiji Restoration, the national flag will be changed to the old imperial flag. The prefecture will retain its old flags, however.\n\nWe have been talking about the prefectural and municipal flags below. The prefectures of Japan are: Hiroshima, Aomori, Ehime, Akita, Chiba, Fumae, Fukui, Gunma, Hiroshima, Ishikawa, Iwate, Kinki, Kanazawa, Kyoiku, Kobayakawa, Kokura, Kyoto, Miyagi, Nagano, Niigata, Osaka, Kyoto, Saitama, Setagaya, Shiga, Tochigi, Tokyo, Tokushima, Niigata, Toyama, Wakayama. The municipalities of Japan are: Nihonbashi, Kanazawa, Ibaraki, Nara, Okinawa, Oita, Tottori, Tochigi, Tokushima, Tokushima Prefecture, Wakayama, Chiba Prefecture.\n\nIn addition to these flags, there are a number of more general flags (such as national flags and flags of a particular political party, for instance) which are associated with the prefecture or municipality where they were created.","token_len":587,"entropy":[10.1869,10.4027,2.8759,0.3312,1.7096,1.741,5.9038,1.1015,1.4192,6.6183,7.3354,0.7994,3.0777,0.0829,13.0492,0.0243,11.1906,0.0927,1.1666,6.2281,3.1526,6.2702,0.6491,7.8807,3.1969,8.572,3.578,0.5007,9.4438,6.1405,0.6762,2.4496,3.3288,10.8374,1.6353,1.1746,0.0182,6.3514,0.002,1.6507,2.1615,2.0878,2.3809,0.5487,5.6593,3.1937,5.017,0.0067,3.1594,1.5863,0.3258,5.391,0.0028,0.7757,2.2241,0.0228,1.3233,6.0298,3.3654,0.0688,3.4204,0.5004,0.2135,3.0668,1.3902,5.5548,4.1037,2.0737,2.8588,4.0718,3.3331,2.1296,2.3597,4.0338,3.1138,0.8105,3.6938,0.6934,1.9574,0.0002,4.7148,5.8177,0.347,3.4076,4.3519,1.0086,0.6892,0.0383,1.2017,4.0852,4.1281,1.3529,1.538,0.8411,3.5807,0.0432,0.0062,2.9653,3.1679,5.0201,0.954,2.1527,5.3027,1.2242,0.5351,2.3336,0.7033,0.6913,0.0432,0.5342,0.2691,0.1497,0.1744,0.065,0.4175,0.3727,0.4157,0.9694,2.7854,4.3493,5.7606,3.3667,0.2994,0.2116,2.6216,2.6068,4.0674,0.1439,4.866,1.6413,0.3755,2.2399,5.1629,2.0871,0.4352,0.1133,3.2805,0.2655,5.0899,0.1877,0.1138,0.1067,3.852,3.3081,0.0401,0.0678,4.4132,1.6476,0.2217,2.4684,2.016,0.457,3.095,3.0405,0.0015,0.0483,3.938,0.3662,0.0002,0.0473,2.8944,0.3223,0.0006,0.0324,2.0392,0.0004,0.059,4.8821,0.0264,2.6757,1.5696,0.0401,3.4059,0.0088,0.0001,0.0146,3.5461,0.0333,0.0471,3.6432,0.006,0.0007,0.2122,5.0806,0.4126,0.0045,0.3404,2.784,3.2453,0.3359,5.4996,0.7273,0.009,0.1332,3.2641,0.0194,0.1728,0.2275,1.8305,3.6826,0.1282,0.178,0.4578,0.0002,2.8105,4.6672,0.0012,0.6428,3.9408,0.6907,5.7488,0.0098,0.0587,3.5015,1.5462,4.4203,0.3731,5.3893,0.1077,0.6717,1.1016,0.7343,0.3491,3.5736,4.5986,0.8798,0.6809,0.0047,0.0461,0.0208,1.3041,0.097,0.5867,0.0067,0.0109,0.4252,0.0231,0.0317,0.0187,0.1019,0.0034,0.0721,0.8108,0.3058,0.0391,0.342,0.3702,0.9926,0.0002,5.964,3.0388,0.6229,4.3113,1.1524,1.2956,0.0196,0.7601,2.1636,1.2885,0.8407,4.8668,3.4009,1.1411,4.81,3.3514,5.342,2.987,1.5495,3.3528,0.107,2.4603,3.6615,1.239,0.0088,0.124,2.6938,3.6838,5.795,5.8584,2.7117,1.8038,4.8148,3.4311,2.2375,1.4627,0.4944,0.0052,4.4216,1.1448,1.0781,3.2795,0.858,3.2464,5.2331,3.0368,0.2898,0.8654,0.7516,0.0195,3.6665,3.2765,2.8421,5.7819,1.4002,2.1081,3.2855,0.0322,0.0049,2.7482,1.4754,2.3643,0.3327,1.9646,0.2618,0.4713,0.0002,4.4807,2.4518,1.0881,0.1239,6.1176,2.7442,1.2927,3.852,2.6484,5.0432,2.3996,0.0395,1.0501,1.0828,1.7202,0.3104,6.2134,3.6657,0.1973,4.3064,0.7365,2.3434,0.0006,0.16,0.7349,0.8131,1.695,0.0193,2.9079,0.8188,3.9683,0.9211,0.5981,6.0223,3.1941,0.1271,0.7164,2.6133,2.574,0.6105,2.0565,2.0841,0.4893,2.9134,3.9694,2.0221,2.4301,0.9289,0.4306,0.0002,4.6913,1.9174,4.0938,4.767,0.2529,0.6793,2.1715,0.3613,1.4553,2.5619,0.2272,0.2416,6.8732,1.1766,2.1796,1.682,0.1026,2.0726,2.372,0.8155,1.5826,3.7027,5.7136,0.2273,2.0172,0.2387,0.0,0.0341,3.4001,0.0,0.0238,4.5543,0.0005,0.0118,1.4591,0.134,0.0092,4.2909,1.2405,1.1784,0.017,1.5489,0.7212,0.0069,0.6362,0.0,0.0026,2.493,0.1545,4.7926,0.0464,0.0131,2.1136,0.004,0.0059,2.9218,0.2093,0.0067,2.7719,3.6705,0.004,0.0049,2.6014,1.0199,1.2835,0.0913,4.4832,0.4819,2.6812,0.0071,0.0094,4.4463,0.1195,0.0049,2.4298,0.0047,1.402,0.3762,0.0038,0.6451,0.4709,0.0051,0.4975,0.0014,0.0,0.0034,3.106,0.0053,5.8589,0.0934,1.926,0.0201,0.0001,0.0081,2.9059,0.0171,0.0002,0.0187,0.5926,0.2388,0.0123,2.337,0.0079,0.0002,0.0164,2.1483,0.0633,2.1078,0.0451,0.1592,6.1364,0.0947,0.0001,0.1524,2.7507,0.0323,0.1222,1.508,0.0031,0.0007,2.118,2.1711,1.1585,0.3024,0.0112,0.0363,0.0663,5.1842,2.4936,0.0157,0.3609,0.0125,0.0735,4.0176,0.9047,0.0108,0.0629,3.8088,0.0813,0.0139,0.0321,3.9796,0.5063,0.023,5.0214,0.0325,3.2778,0.2055,0.015,4.4925,0.0834,0.0003,0.0305,2.1668,0.0267,0.0235,0.0274,2.0059,0.0275,0.1342,3.402,0.1117,0.3462,0.0098,0.4307,2.3523,0.0082,0.0009,0.6982,4.6622,0.1649,0.7288,0.0013,1.4967,0.5775,0.0002,3.2557,1.7841,0.663,1.9564,3.0541,0.2353,1.2118,0.1742,2.753,0.7206,0.0063,5.7498,3.0749,0.4228,4.8277,2.8038,0.0037,3.3632,0.5313,2.0976,1.5834,0.5196,4.7057,2.587,3.5732,0.1987,2.0466,3.0507,1.7809,0.7104,0.9359,0.6943,6.1314,0.0556,1.2674,0.6976,0.3208,1.0712,0.2737,6.1416,0.2191,2.3296,3.7627,0.2575]}
{"id":1953,"ended":true,"length":451,"gen_text":"A set of characters were indicated by Barnum Brown in 1914 to distinguish Corythosaurus from all other hadrosaurids from Alberta : a comparatively short skull with a high helmet @ - @ like crest formed by the teeth, short hind limbs and long forelimbs (like a turtle) like a crocodile with short legs and powerful tail. That is the way, that the first identification was made: as a Cretaceous hadrosaur.\nWith this simple identification of the skull and forelimbs Corythosaurus is identified in the first edition of Cretaceous paleontology: \"Crimson [Hadrosauridae].\" And since we know that the first author of that famous book of the scientific world, Charles Darwin knew nothing about any animal called \"Hadrosaurs\" the identity of Corythosaurus is probably false.\nWith this false identification of the animal in a textbook, in 1883, some paleontologists (including H.P.H. Pemberton and J.E.H. LeConte) believed that Hadrosaurs are a kind of crocodile that walked on all fours and lived in water! And in this way Corythosaurus can be declared not to have a skull, like other dinosaurs.\nThe name Corythosaurus is very convenient for a paleontologist, but even after the 19 th century, it was still not widely recognized. For example:\n- In 1887, R. Haines (unidentified paleontologist) published the work \"Chrytonosaurus\", in which Corythosaurus can be recognized.\n- In 1888, William R. Hennings discovered a partial skull and hindlimb of an ichthyosaur in Kansas and described it as a Corythosaur, so he is called this \"Corythosaurus Hennings \".\n- in 1902 a ichthyosaur of that species is named:\n- in 1914 George L. Stebbins discovered an unidentifiable fossil found in the fossiliferous limestone of Montana and named it \"Corythosaurus\", so he is called this \"Corythosaurus Stebbins\".\n- in 1932 A.W.E. Cope made some discoveries in Utah that have been named Corythosaurus (and later on, Cretosaurus) and he is said to have found this type of creature several times.\nWith the discovery and publication of this new species, the species Corythosaurus was recognized and became closely followed by other hadrosaurs. A little later, during the first Paleocene, some of these creatures lived near the lakes of Alberta. And so the new species became known as Caudostrapus ephippii, which means \"Great Corythosaurus\". And a very few other Corythosaurus species could be discovered during the last stages of the Late Cretaceous.","token_len":588,"entropy":[7.5851,0.2572,6.9725,4.5412,9.6125,1.3725,12.8329,1.6689,6.6359,3.0225,6.631,3.4548,7.3294,15.466,4.3742,2.7566,0.8021,3.3487,0.294,5.7669,0.0003,1.0692,0.2827,5.1464,7.1624,10.0103,3.5858,8.0044,1.8603,1.862,2.0886,0.8655,3.6117,8.6817,16.1831,5.4944,8.477,7.454,6.1359,7.6857,0.2742,1.2412,4.5452,1.2158,3.8115,3.8032,1.101,1.613,2.7626,1.3703,0.2457,0.0125,3.1798,3.5042,1.7083,4.1643,1.6697,4.8758,1.1029,1.5549,0.0702,3.4979,3.5545,2.5109,1.2776,5.7287,1.3731,0.6308,5.8441,2.3807,1.6364,4.7369,4.8456,2.5238,1.9784,3.2322,5.8896,1.624,0.322,3.5715,3.0777,0.6011,4.9883,1.2181,0.1259,0.9214,0.0035,0.0189,3.1697,1.1673,6.6372,2.7245,5.1533,2.071,3.0516,1.5676,3.0468,1.623,3.728,0.017,0.1227,3.8849,0.0063,0.01,2.8132,4.5833,2.208,0.6981,2.1043,2.3384,0.122,4.0902,0.3806,0.0049,4.5243,0.0349,0.0715,4.4257,2.0653,1.0021,6.6704,0.0128,4.7765,2.7687,0.0053,0.0966,1.2617,4.5922,4.7346,3.9228,5.5457,1.4881,0.7838,1.6019,2.3535,4.7472,0.6315,1.9797,5.0041,1.2917,3.9838,2.0425,4.6935,1.0745,1.3173,2.8895,0.925,6.5322,1.6337,0.1954,4.9253,4.9579,3.7344,1.5944,1.8234,0.0115,3.9643,0.005,0.6261,4.5428,5.3251,0.2961,1.1859,0.0093,0.0065,1.4532,4.8073,4.6901,0.4244,1.1541,5.261,1.5872,2.831,0.1879,1.2395,1.2097,3.0019,2.9962,4.4639,3.8994,1.9776,4.1287,3.7259,3.8213,0.9047,5.1736,3.1096,0.0163,0.129,3.0472,2.6605,4.4907,1.0447,4.1082,0.027,4.1151,0.4672,4.1707,0.8169,0.0041,1.9938,2.0474,0.0147,2.8145,0.0083,3.0372,0.0969,5.6371,1.96,0.0001,0.275,4.6692,0.2707,4.0573,0.0029,0.8861,0.0012,3.0747,2.4874,2.991,0.0051,2.616,0.4107,3.7345,5.3297,0.187,1.2585,0.0378,0.0988,2.0876,2.8153,0.4116,3.2889,4.7722,2.9963,3.0294,2.6696,1.249,2.6981,0.0111,0.0063,4.3653,0.2464,5.2729,4.3952,1.9396,2.0273,2.313,1.7491,1.6446,4.7417,2.4212,3.0289,1.6693,0.926,2.5196,3.8683,0.9751,0.0104,0.0099,1.6079,4.5856,5.5393,0.9766,2.8826,2.6246,0.0264,0.0896,1.557,2.5657,5.3173,4.5829,1.6936,6.0196,2.0935,0.0989,1.4738,2.5293,1.1325,1.7926,1.3952,3.5903,2.7714,1.5428,3.6857,1.0022,3.6381,2.0312,3.1069,1.7551,1.8436,2.5994,1.4072,4.5229,0.1516,4.1017,5.461,0.212,2.4807,5.7418,4.6797,2.8432,0.0241,0.0209,0.4851,2.9223,2.0149,5.2537,0.653,5.9786,3.5444,5.0321,0.6027,2.4638,2.4137,0.2925,3.4284,0.014,0.0069,4.2729,0.1037,2.4792,2.2413,0.7766,0.0718,0.4106,2.8728,0.2652,6.0747,3.7797,0.2216,3.0044,3.8698,3.914,4.6584,1.4845,3.153,0.8719,2.6947,4.0755,0.6179,0.2334,0.4024,3.976,5.1715,0.0179,0.0917,0.0289,0.002,1.9172,5.2359,2.4469,2.8686,0.4507,0.1887,1.8276,0.6145,0.0036,5.0477,0.0465,2.793,4.6806,2.2639,2.4897,3.6904,5.8279,3.5011,1.0906,0.076,0.0461,0.0442,2.4119,0.1641,0.0035,4.94,0.1845,0.1772,5.4083,4.6813,3.9204,5.3262,0.0033,0.0089,0.0224,0.0003,4.1967,4.9128,2.5735,2.6946,2.2747,4.6125,5.4836,0.6002,0.8204,4.5573,6.1188,4.2286,0.0879,4.5928,2.6888,0.0568,0.0091,2.87,3.0459,4.7845,0.248,0.2882,3.0866,5.4457,0.285,2.2663,5.3784,2.7367,0.002,2.035,0.8479,3.7116,1.4343,1.4468,0.1618,1.1614,0.5612,0.0999,0.03,0.0233,2.7422,1.8467,0.229,0.1011,0.4062,0.1442,0.1123,0.0555,0.0115,0.0265,0.0237,0.1106,0.0017,0.0031,0.0014,2.1413,0.1455,0.6458,0.4137,4.0846,4.3973,0.1542,3.4278,0.0082,5.7173,0.0376,5.2066,0.7339,5.129,3.6327,2.1998,0.7163,3.3301,2.6041,4.1484,1.2153,1.9929,1.5217,0.0108,0.0512,2.829,3.2899,3.9078,3.2507,2.3493,2.8957,0.5985,1.3986,0.9023,1.5027,2.6922,0.8432,4.8804,0.0441,0.3768,2.332,3.587,4.121,0.122,4.1485,5.6804,0.2338,1.3974,0.6214,4.997,1.7025,2.5378,3.91,3.2906,0.0817,2.6895,1.6901,0.9746,1.4956,1.8087,4.4085,1.1847,0.0077,0.0222,1.6825,2.1122,2.2278,4.564,6.8913,4.8457,0.4952,1.4104,1.2552,0.0021,0.7873,0.0007,0.9587,4.5106,4.7765,0.7629,0.8987,5.0548,0.1384,3.001,6.2653,0.7425,1.2478,3.4197,2.4541,1.4128,3.0295,3.3785,3.7864,0.6143,4.5435,0.7302,2.0855,1.6514,3.4148,3.981,2.0192,3.3589,0.5087,3.6976,1.0538,0.3215,2.4414,4.617,7.1843,6.0074,0.1987,5.7957,2.6976,0.0427,2.3179,2.3138,2.0615,0.8489,0.4325,4.7754,1.5213,0.0966,0.1211,0.6149,3.3111,4.2809,4.452,3.6017,3.1125,4.0072,0.0062,0.6981,1.4883,4.076,0.2094,3.5548,2.0986,0.4128,4.0364,5.004,0.0226,0.1529,4.3791,0.3106,0.0019,0.0011,1.0867]}
{"id":1126,"ended":false,"length":497,"gen_text":"Prior to abandoning Juana Ibarguren, Juan Duarte had been her sole means of support. Biographer, John Barnes, writes that after this abandonment, all Duarte left to the family was a suitcase and some clothes that are found in the Juana Ibarguren home\n\nThe case is somewhat unusual in that it did not involve a woman accused of prostitution. It also involved a man who admitted to having a prostitute on the run.\n\nAnother unusual aspect of this case is that Ibarguren received a public apology in the newspaper El Cronista from Jos\u00e9 Duarte Rodr\u00edguez, a leader in the New People's Army (NPA) from 1969 to 1981 who was also the chairman of the National Indigenous Council (CONICET), a government agency with ties to the guerrilla group.\n\nIt is not known how much was found in Rodr\u00edguez's possession with Ibarguren's murder but her former lover, who died in 2006, estimated she had a value of about $1.3 million.\n\nThis was about the same amount Duarte Rodr\u00edguez claimed he had with her when police raided the family's house in 2002 and seized several items.\n\nAlthough Rodriguez was pardoned last year after serving his time, he was never prosecuted for killing Ibarguren.\n\nIn the press conference, the president also explained that because the case was now presented under Ecuador's Constitution, \"we are free to make the investigation as fast as possible.\"\n\nHe explained that the arrest had been made in response to a tip that Ibarguren had been held in a house in Santa Rosa del Monte and that at least one person died in that house during an operation in 1989.\n\nRodriguez admitted using cocaine and also said he had used heroin for \"a long time at my age,\" which suggested the prostitute was a drug addict.\n\nHe also pointed to the fact that Ibarguren's passport indicated that she had left the country in the early morning on Feb. 3, 1989, days before she was killed.\n\nA friend who took Ibarguren's place in Santa Rosa del Monte the day she disappeared, Angelina Mart\u00ednez, admitted during the press conference that she did not leave a suicide note and could not provide a motive for her death. However, friends say that Mart\u00ednez had never had trouble with Rodr\u00edguez before and that they had a falling out about money after her release.\n\nAfter Rodr\u00edguez's plea, Prosecutor Atencio Guill\u00e9n noted that despite some inconsistencies in her story, there were similarities that led the prosecutor to believe her statements contained truth.\n\nAs for the possibility of more dead bodies, Guill\u00e9n said that police could still be looking for other victims of the Santa Rosa del Monte apartment.\n\nRead more from TeleSur:","token_len":588,"entropy":[0.3953,9.0963,7.5999,9.1746,9.6642,1.9517,8.3293,0.8077,7.201,8.2671,0.1614,1.7839,1.7984,7.0383,5.4888,8.8848,0.038,2.3996,0.7396,10.7743,2.1598,4.743,3.9247,7.7949,0.3984,2.4325,0.9101,3.9632,6.326,5.1948,0.4807,6.833,3.4437,0.0008,5.1384,3.4274,3.1518,2.8224,0.443,1.2977,4.0757,1.8326,2.3193,1.7317,3.6745,6.3393,4.9481,0.5701,0.6491,4.7387,0.0336,0.1735,0.0069,0.0125,2.7751,5.7643,0.0138,2.5165,4.5405,2.2524,5.6131,2.6734,1.1111,0.2175,1.44,4.7886,0.0324,1.0458,0.8122,3.6284,4.072,0.0432,4.4104,1.0827,2.8081,2.7006,2.1656,0.4649,1.5676,1.4932,5.5373,0.5453,1.5927,2.4214,3.3639,3.5168,1.7321,3.0013,1.2552,1.7258,0.0002,5.2634,2.1199,0.3884,0.287,1.0827,0.2015,0.3763,0.2983,4.9819,0.0033,0.0016,6.4535,1.4302,4.6936,1.7684,3.2505,1.4829,3.1185,1.512,5.6084,0.1213,3.5404,4.7112,3.0529,0.001,6.9107,0.0136,0.0015,0.0019,0.0001,0.7327,3.0436,5.4058,1.3941,0.2962,5.4027,2.9321,0.1287,0.0248,1.2252,2.0044,0.0002,0.8082,5.1298,3.8522,0.5118,3.0565,2.6234,1.2557,3.0609,2.2674,5.5789,0.0238,0.2128,2.7569,4.7068,2.0445,0.8621,1.129,0.9598,1.22,2.3217,1.5936,2.5387,1.3562,4.3823,4.894,0.0163,0.2402,5.2431,1.8756,0.7203,0.8795,0.0002,4.2593,0.91,2.1133,0.9886,2.2891,2.0395,4.3917,5.5976,0.4313,4.1329,0.0078,0.0015,0.0009,0.0002,0.2645,3.3941,4.2878,1.8841,0.0048,0.0005,1.3882,3.9813,2.7581,5.2796,5.6705,1.3879,0.9295,3.6714,4.2536,0.4637,3.5242,0.1338,5.9067,3.4068,0.5401,1.9425,4.4077,0.0832,2.2383,0.7584,2.5295,1.4283,2.5798,0.0789,0.5155,0.5217,0.0002,4.036,2.6722,4.2101,2.041,0.1974,0.4563,3.4969,0.0001,2.3596,0.003,0.0009,0.0011,0.0001,3.5336,1.4688,1.0417,3.727,1.9053,1.4584,6.5584,1.916,2.2983,3.0791,0.902,1.7008,0.853,4.7492,1.9924,2.3615,3.8246,2.3963,1.4431,0.7363,0.0002,4.7303,5.9395,1.8342,5.2986,0.0002,5.4889,0.4804,2.5952,0.5735,2.6475,2.1779,0.6448,1.3724,1.6758,2.2188,2.0557,0.4866,4.2467,0.1303,0.002,0.0002,0.4512,0.7621,0.0002,2.9161,2.104,5.4882,0.5934,1.1732,2.1807,4.3861,3.2664,4.7153,0.7064,5.7228,1.8306,1.8098,1.1409,5.6943,5.951,4.446,6.0759,0.8587,2.7584,0.2673,4.5162,1.9524,2.119,3.4276,0.1957,3.7309,2.1187,2.9887,1.7718,5.1281,0.1448,0.7243,1.1692,0.3028,0.0002,2.8577,3.7525,0.1969,1.2012,5.265,4.2865,0.722,0.4844,2.0709,4.4577,0.0082,0.9238,1.9456,3.332,2.1952,0.0014,0.0001,1.6626,0.4619,4.9093,1.8247,1.2715,1.3308,0.7945,4.545,3.0953,2.4188,3.4516,2.7039,0.8409,5.3982,0.3857,0.9223,1.3674,5.8546,1.3711,1.4876,0.138,3.9447,2.5746,2.2412,2.6837,6.2712,0.2698,0.299,0.0002,2.9491,0.4892,0.0011,4.2586,6.0324,2.8649,1.2375,4.3342,2.2562,0.6687,0.7221,3.1986,3.4929,4.2072,3.9853,1.4974,0.7378,0.0306,7.7384,6.3928,0.9327,2.1772,2.6721,6.206,2.9006,5.5685,1.1069,2.5033,1.565,0.7275,0.4485,0.3252,0.0002,2.3358,1.0107,5.6178,1.6594,1.1474,0.784,0.0423,1.2634,0.0024,0.0002,1.9834,5.7023,3.9952,1.3891,0.0822,0.7659,2.6989,1.0106,0.1478,1.3706,2.9734,1.8285,1.8999,3.6378,4.7286,0.0358,3.2788,0.4514,1.1083,0.6562,6.1194,0.3112,1.263,0.3906,1.0666,0.1674,0.2887,0.0002,4.0064,5.4444,2.4198,4.8588,0.4064,0.0009,0.0001,2.2172,2.3742,2.0123,2.5133,0.1023,0.7799,0.0062,3.3496,0.9424,0.7987,0.6267,2.2532,5.6712,2.2271,5.0118,0.179,0.0044,0.0013,0.3806,5.4135,3.6868,1.0691,0.2356,0.0086,0.1054,0.6873,4.2606,0.4092,4.1656,4.8733,3.5546,0.0013,1.5788,4.1182,0.1316,2.7995,1.7687,1.4408,0.4099,1.2006,1.0145,0.1086,4.3755,0.0409,6.9428,3.0359,1.5618,2.0,0.0092,0.0004,0.0002,1.645,5.4732,3.1515,6.0331,0.3078,1.5581,0.0303,0.0004,0.0006,0.0,2.5747,1.6013,1.0462,2.7073,1.5325,3.2878,2.0423,0.0957,3.342,1.7682,3.4273,3.4445,5.1923,2.0546,0.1853,0.0002,4.7025,2.2287,0.0032,0.0005,0.0006,0.0001,0.7048,6.4974,0.8147,5.1241,5.7423,4.2381,0.678,0.0155,5.2746,2.4185,0.2418,5.607,0.2226,5.5053,4.7512,1.6477,0.369,3.0876,1.0469,0.1979,2.4512,1.24,4.0385,3.5521,2.4599,2.7672,2.5994,0.0935,0.8141,3.2095,4.2904,6.3186,3.2259,0.1158,0.3173,0.0002,4.7582,1.2125,1.1551,4.3012,0.8862,4.4924,6.3486,0.5419,1.3185,0.8518,0.0021,0.0104,0.7241,1.2173,3.5976,3.7304,3.8023,2.3087,1.0916,0.1353,2.5343,0.8855,2.4184,1.6052,5.5324,0.0885,0.0538,0.0066,5.4306,1.488,0.5505,0.0001,5.5853,0.9197,3.108,5.2207,0.903,0.4143]}
{"id":2628,"ended":false,"length":490,"gen_text":"Schofield was drafted in the 4th round of the 2010 NFL Draft, 130th overall, by the Arizona Cardinals. Since Schofield was injured, he was considered a good value because his talent was never questioned, that is until the 2012 season. But in the NFL, most players' careers end with them playing for a losing team.\n\nSchofield has been a starting defensive end for the Bengals since 2011 but he has been forced to settle for depth or special teams duty and never got the chance to see the field, and most recently he was sidelined due to a concussion and lost his starting job in the 2016 season. And since we are talking about quarterbacks, it was difficult to find a better comparison for Schofield but for now let's talk about our next starting quarterback the Philadelphia Eagles: Carson Wentz.\n\nWhen asked what he liked more about being drafted in the 4th round, Carson Wentz said,\n\n\"Just the opportunity to start from day one and work your way up. As far as football IQ, I definitely have the better IQ but at the end of the day you have to work your way up, you have to earn it. That's the way it goes\"\n\nIt is not just about the talent that Wentz showed during his very first NFL game where he dominated the Indianapolis Colts, by all accounts he was the most impressive quarterback in the National Football League.\n\nWentz put on a clinic in the Eagles 3rd preseason game, where he threw for 7 TDs and had over 250 yards passing. In his second NFL game, he took on the Detroit Lions and completed 21\/28 for 271 yards and a touchdown. And when the games started to get closer, Wentz only showed the NFL world what he was really capable of. In the Eagles 14-10 loss to the Green Bay Packers, Wentz finished with 31\/41 for 314 yards and 3 TDs, in less than 1 quarter. At this point fans were so impressed with the performance by Wentz that the Eagles traded up into the 2nd round and draft the quarterback of the future.\n\nWith that being said, let's talk about how Carson Wentz compares to other NFL quarterbacks.\n\nHeight: 6\u2032 2\u2033\n\nWeight: 225 lbs\n\nArm Length: 32 5\/8\u2033\n\nHeight at Break: 6\u2032 1\u2033\n\nWeight: 217 lbs\n\nSchool: North Dakota State\n\nExperience: Started 20 games over two years in Division I\n\nQuarterback Rating: 97.2\n\nAccuracy Percentage: 84.5\n\nTotal QBR: 91.5\n\nYards Per Attempt: 7.3\n\nPercentage of Team Completions: 61.4\n\nAthleticism Ratings: 40 yards on 10 carries, 3 pass attempts, 11 yards\n\nDegrees: B","token_len":588,"entropy":[7.8682,0.0076,3.6355,6.7535,1.1442,0.252,4.337,0.0088,0.04,0.9323,0.0769,2.6364,0.9854,0.283,2.4758,8.0842,0.1211,0.0421,1.5833,0.3885,0.0896,3.6798,0.0022,0.3196,4.509,8.7174,0.003,0.0,1.5551,6.0859,3.7184,1.2546,1.18,6.7684,0.8431,5.627,2.7217,5.299,3.9527,5.0399,0.7689,4.5416,1.4244,2.5116,7.2117,0.9431,0.2369,1.7985,2.9704,0.3522,0.6385,6.6432,2.8515,1.984,3.4998,0.3794,6.0693,1.6146,5.156,1.6172,2.6841,2.5013,3.2844,2.4992,1.9067,1.4505,2.1935,0.1162,0.7394,1.8873,0.0021,1.8838,0.0091,0.0001,3.3655,1.5316,1.5111,4.5382,2.351,0.6817,0.6959,0.4345,4.7403,0.625,1.823,4.3064,2.0604,1.0007,1.6379,5.1948,0.173,5.3258,0.1518,5.6306,4.4929,2.1324,0.0402,1.9031,3.6273,3.1592,2.9579,1.5772,0.7192,0.0436,4.6769,0.7501,0.1119,4.3501,3.7999,4.531,3.3116,2.3063,0.9291,4.7745,2.973,0.0064,0.7684,2.375,3.3995,4.1724,0.6697,0.767,0.4163,2.4692,1.0891,3.5725,0.7377,0.2386,5.3696,4.0752,5.9501,1.2991,0.7971,0.0587,4.8362,0.3629,2.776,2.5244,5.7737,0.6927,2.4267,0.9313,2.3854,3.9755,1.1894,1.8477,0.0045,0.0001,5.5316,4.4953,1.9524,1.8029,0.1408,3.3459,0.0478,5.458,2.8337,4.1199,0.2791,6.5754,5.2788,0.0105,3.6644,1.7066,0.0066,0.0002,0.0892,0.132,0.0002,3.5655,3.9214,2.5174,1.3405,2.9305,4.9849,0.2579,4.9626,1.8719,1.9521,0.1488,0.8401,0.0027,0.0814,0.9357,2.1149,0.059,0.0001,0.8746,1.5193,2.0999,0.0002,0.5579,3.5756,1.4564,1.5027,0.5787,3.367,4.9915,0.5793,0.0423,1.9515,3.6354,2.0831,0.0248,0.3904,1.3831,5.2317,1.8527,0.0115,4.5172,3.2387,0.4524,0.8102,4.9019,3.2408,2.5139,3.0156,1.695,3.7779,3.4122,0.0778,0.7603,0.0075,0.0082,0.0024,2.051,0.9891,0.0264,2.6674,1.7852,0.0337,0.2567,3.0387,1.6044,0.635,0.0171,1.1845,1.5035,0.9593,2.3914,0.2269,1.7597,1.5634,0.6505,2.0588,5.6269,0.1691,0.0002,3.5078,1.3319,3.0449,2.8522,2.1939,1.1739,2.8025,2.4527,0.784,0.0004,4.1312,2.3049,0.2701,6.4062,0.7606,1.3875,0.9293,4.1857,0.0682,6.7512,0.5847,3.8656,0.0032,1.7995,5.4501,3.3519,0.3045,0.904,1.1639,1.6827,2.1019,1.2054,1.4591,0.9494,0.3701,5.3679,0.0564,0.0353,1.4174,2.2632,0.0002,2.3353,0.0018,0.0008,5.4955,1.5108,0.2609,1.5034,1.7307,1.4289,1.9045,6.2592,0.4865,0.0206,0.024,2.31,2.661,0.2025,1.0658,0.2624,5.2582,2.4924,0.6256,3.3637,3.1897,3.206,0.2102,1.1564,0.7572,2.9373,1.6289,1.8187,3.0903,0.3832,0.7383,1.051,4.5859,2.5524,0.1938,2.6824,0.0023,1.0207,4.4229,3.039,1.9607,2.7407,1.4394,4.8584,0.0247,0.3932,2.0953,1.0884,0.472,2.9652,3.8526,1.5942,4.2566,1.9197,0.4041,1.7944,2.2462,0.9401,0.6209,0.0004,4.821,4.0012,3.6712,3.6544,2.9877,1.6574,0.2273,1.1903,2.9262,0.6596,0.0191,0.7458,2.1846,0.8394,0.82,4.6926,0.4346,1.2717,2.1762,0.2719,0.0401,2.7924,0.008,0.0067,0.299,0.3718,0.0002,4.4008,1.5272,4.3817,0.1921,2.8013,0.3009,4.8107,0.0269,0.3124,1.0997,0.5453,2.2179,4.2138,6.1266,0.101,4.4007,1.296,1.3579,5.6721,1.554,0.1341,6.8653,1.2078,4.7891,2.5651,0.5611,1.5301,4.0402,3.4511,0.6278,0.0005,0.5143,2.265,0.8835,1.2181,0.6872,3.5886,0.0341,0.6488,0.0016,0.0753,2.1046,4.3443,2.4043,2.7705,2.6428,0.4804,0.1896,0.5255,0.2416,0.0002,4.4125,3.2573,0.728,0.0112,0.1234,2.2453,0.0653,1.7078,0.0842,2.2497,2.6241,0.0383,0.0001,1.5658,0.1066,3.1262,3.0995,0.7237,0.9835,0.7311,0.0002,3.3855,0.8913,0.2565,2.3656,1.9616,0.1691,0.426,0.0002,0.0681,0.0094,3.0351,0.5778,0.4896,0.0002,0.9368,0.1217,0.0146,0.8578,4.029,0.0025,0.0025,0.1034,0.0405,0.0002,3.5056,3.1957,4.9113,0.0704,0.064,0.1484,1.3825,0.231,0.0294,0.0002,1.4584,2.1439,2.9438,0.0356,0.085,0.0002,5.7996,0.1032,0.0866,0.0647,0.0529,0.3432,0.0002,3.8797,0.1056,4.044,5.5039,0.1673,3.8104,1.8033,1.6048,2.6733,4.2193,0.6734,0.9094,0.0002,4.8445,0.0829,0.4786,1.4005,0.1821,3.1959,0.0533,2.3519,0.3681,0.0002,3.7789,0.2124,0.7312,0.1245,4.6054,0.2753,2.3059,1.6115,0.0002,4.0937,0.2713,0.0002,0.1241,3.5391,0.1024,2.3308,0.0519,0.0002,2.456,0.1208,0.6123,0.1302,0.137,1.5751,0.0139,2.7472,0.1104,0.0002,4.8134,0.1444,0.0518,4.0018,3.0496,0.0777,0.0004,0.183,3.5493,0.0961,2.3042,0.5779,0.0002,4.9681,0.9008,0.043,0.5445,4.7593,0.1749,1.4782,4.0743,0.3996,3.0506,1.0805,0.8743,2.5887,6.1335,1.1142,1.3728,4.6658,0.5402,1.1587,0.0002,4.3723,5.473,0.6863,1.2358,1.5136]}

She owned property in Cologne, London, and Stockholm before selling it in 2009 for < r > 3,240,000\n\nAlison is the daughter of Dr. Andrew Turner, a neurosurgeon, and the namesake of Andrew Turner Turner's Ch\u00e2teau Algonquin.\n\nAlison has had her own personal and professional interests since adolescence.\n\nAndrew Turner and Alison\n\nWhen Alison was younger, her father was her primary caregiver for much of her life. His constant care and love has kept her strong.\n\nAndrew and Hannah met when they were teenagers at boarding school. She was a friend of the girls from their school's swim meet, and they soon became a couple. Despite being 14 at the time they first kissed, they remained friends, and they have grown up together during the years since then. They married in 2007. As part of their honeymoon they took an overseas honeymoon to Disneyland, so Alison said that her daughter grew up in a fairy tale!\n\n\nIt wasn't long before Andrew was calling her every day to set a time to visit. Each time she went, he got very excited because he knew he was going to give her the best vacation of her life. Hannah's parents, Michael and Jennifer, were very supportive, and their children, who are now 6, 9 and 12, were overjoyed.\n\nAndrew has a strong relationship with his children that isn't always easy to understand. The children know that Andrew has to come home at least once a week, but the children don't always get the message that Andrew is the sole provider for his children. When their mother had to work long distance, Andrew and his wife, Amanda, have split the bills between them. For a while, Alison didn't notice any change in her father-daughter relationship. However, she now realizes that Adam's children weren't treated with love and affection and that it was only when Adam was going through tough times that they began spending time together.\n\nShe's had some difficult feelings over the years: one because her father took some of the credit for the family's financial success (and did everything without even asking); another was over Andrew's refusal to put his family up in a nice place in Europe so that they could see the world. Andrew has said that he will not pay for his son to go to Europe over Hannah's objections. As she has seen with her own eyes, it is an expensive trip, not only in terms of funds but also because the children don't have the chance to visit.\n\nAlison is a strong woman who loves her family and her boyfriend.

{"id":2214,"ended":true,"length":517,"gen_text":"After marrying Mary Chappel on January 31, 1828, they moved to Middleburg Township in Cuyahoga County, Ohio in April of that year. It was there that Baldwin joined forces with James T. Callender in a plan to seize Mary's 1824 farm of about 16 acres because he intended to make it into a cattle farm.\n\nOn February 14, 1829, Baldwin and Callender gathered a group of men and marched south on the Ohio River to the mouth of the Niagara River. There they planned to cross the river on what they had built outrigger boat and float downstream, taking the women and children with him. The plan was successful and Baldwin and Callender were able to pass their plans on to the next group looking for a ship.\n\nAt 4 A.M. on February 14, Callender and 40 additional men, under the command of a Captain Robert Marder, arrived with the planter's boat. The ship had the capacity to take 150 men. The planters left, taking their wives and children along with them.\n\nOn April 14, 1829, three days after boarding the ship, the men reached shore, accompanied by the boat, and met the ship's captain, John Martin. Martin knew that his ship was full of planters from New York City.\n\nIn the conversation Martin asked: \"How many men can you take with you?\"\n\nBaldwin replied: \"In all, 40 men ; and we had twenty-five on board.\"\n\nMartin said: \"And do you intend that the ship carrying these men can get over Niagara Falls, without us coming and checking them?\"\n\nBaldwin replied: \"Yes, we think, Captain Martin.\"\n\nAfter Martin refused to cooperate and attempted to stop the planters with rifle at the foot of the Falls, their boat was blown off course and plunged into Niagara Falls! Although many of the men perished in the attempt, eight of them were able to jump from the overhanging rocks and swim to shore where they were met by Martin's ship, the Easton, which had been commanded by William P. Hamilton. During the remainder of the month until April 18, they tried to get Hamilton to help them save the ship.\n\nBy May 7, the group of men, with Mary Chappel and her children, entered New York City, and returned to New York. While living in Brooklyn, Mary Chappel married Benjamin Silliman and became a resident of the first of several houses on the Hudson. On July, 1829, she also returned to her farm near Middleburg Township, Ohio.\n\nMary Chappel's daughter Mary Elizabeth lived with her brother Charles from 1856 -1859. Mary Chappel eventually married a Cleveland businessman, Thomas F. Chappel, also a descendant of Thomas Chappel.","token_len":589,"entropy":[9.1434,6.7925,7.7967,4.0474,1.8096,4.4948,3.3064,3.5041,0.0952,1.0058,4.5398,0.1024,4.3938,1.5268,0.2676,7.0012,2.5608,5.1123,2.171,6.3537,1.3753,0.0032,0.0,0.019,0.7408,0.0881,4.5309,4.4984,1.8041,1.311,0.0485,0.25,4.3047,0.3676,1.9017,0.3759,9.6312,5.5854,3.3203,0.0108,3.4217,4.3529,0.5157,5.117,1.3726,3.8779,2.0255,1.9519,0.0925,3.3697,7.182,0.5092,4.8565,3.7347,2.7204,2.3553,2.693,4.8702,0.3846,6.211,1.986,5.5105,0.0338,3.6617,0.9263,1.8601,0.1673,4.1198,2.1528,0.3008,1.8363,0.0103,2.0619,2.685,3.2935,0.0725,0.1409,0.8231,0.0743,1.3951,1.0955,0.3926,0.0009,5.0067,1.68,1.2836,0.0468,1.4486,0.9058,3.4776,4.6045,1.5785,1.2015,2.364,0.3696,1.1981,1.1862,4.174,0.0123,0.3637,5.5561,0.1107,0.9011,2.7089,0.8187,3.4785,0.0867,2.7171,0.4475,0.168,2.7053,5.8594,1.4909,3.8627,3.6635,3.5493,4.8689,0.2598,6.0083,1.6958,4.2555,3.9221,3.3723,3.5589,1.5625,6.0488,0.3805,0.1259,0.4269,6.8272,0.2078,2.6909,1.4215,0.8299,3.9857,1.3028,1.5217,0.6611,0.4365,0.0005,1.2411,1.4272,0.0033,5.0805,4.5567,3.7904,0.9216,0.0377,1.6171,3.9342,1.2491,7.7246,1.0113,1.0352,5.2291,1.7928,0.6695,0.0002,4.0401,5.068,4.8751,0.0013,0.0051,0.1006,0.1992,0.5917,2.7933,0.0719,4.6329,0.0007,1.0782,6.1193,6.4628,0.2374,2.5157,4.5986,0.1951,0.2483,0.0039,3.9926,2.69,4.5278,4.4784,6.3777,1.1859,0.1895,2.6417,3.7721,1.6137,3.1823,2.3106,0.3773,1.7963,1.2681,1.673,4.7914,3.594,4.7638,3.5583,0.3199,3.431,3.6626,1.5745,1.7089,1.5329,2.7557,0.9429,5.3873,4.8034,2.8136,2.2038,1.4275,0.3937,0.2043,2.6785,0.9476,0.0354,0.1883,1.2241,0.0002,2.7521,4.721,3.5067,0.0856,0.386,0.033,0.0777,5.1035,0.7587,0.3047,5.7691,0.2402,0.8614,0.2303,0.9717,1.359,4.5472,4.2944,2.6453,6.6085,0.0701,1.8805,3.0509,2.479,1.2973,3.7947,1.9276,3.2736,0.6902,0.7637,1.0524,2.5956,5.9187,0.6883,2.0077,5.2727,1.5083,3.7129,1.587,1.0645,4.5019,0.4456,3.0348,0.0624,2.9873,2.6368,0.3011,2.2493,1.8415,2.8118,0.0002,3.7024,1.6104,5.3493,3.3403,1.653,5.0514,0.4214,2.4622,0.7608,1.7814,4.2991,0.3883,0.9477,1.1764,0.0164,0.5437,0.8609,0.0002,2.4788,0.0014,0.0002,0.9283,0.6925,0.0265,5.5993,1.414,0.7675,4.8571,1.3164,8.6012,2.308,2.0805,5.1277,4.6689,0.8382,1.0531,2.5198,0.1542,1.1432,0.1518,0.0002,0.6834,2.3698,0.4345,0.0121,4.6926,4.0516,0.0853,1.5751,6.2321,2.8503,3.7003,5.6251,1.9254,0.8436,4.6585,3.2748,4.0915,2.9087,2.3128,2.9715,3.5009,3.6625,3.2297,2.7646,5.8179,1.3399,0.2208,0.0548,0.0002,0.3047,0.0003,0.0004,0.5762,0.0915,0.0075,1.2093,0.8033,2.1004,4.1104,5.5829,2.9093,1.7677,0.9513,0.0604,0.0002,3.6664,2.6629,4.053,0.2697,5.4441,2.6314,4.5329,0.0235,3.4149,0.2398,1.2467,0.1748,3.9695,6.1232,7.2912,1.0537,4.7118,0.0153,0.2821,2.246,0.0656,6.3706,1.0106,1.4177,4.239,1.4488,1.0539,0.758,5.6542,0.3262,4.5269,1.0762,7.4804,6.1857,4.2107,1.0983,0.1046,0.5053,4.122,1.3465,0.0326,4.8214,0.4887,5.4932,1.6911,1.3959,1.1381,0.708,0.0029,3.625,1.5777,0.0707,6.6305,0.6246,0.0032,1.076,1.2357,1.6668,0.4489,0.376,4.0351,0.1489,0.2418,2.1887,0.0568,4.2803,2.5271,3.158,1.7513,0.7047,5.8245,3.5383,1.0264,1.5924,1.3697,1.4367,4.7644,0.0608,2.4625,4.5172,0.2485,5.5277,0.4324,6.2506,0.2689,5.793,0.0022,0.2115,3.9204,7.0269,2.8092,1.7087,0.4779,4.8823,3.8724,0.3872,1.6829,3.5483,0.4482,2.3468,0.2803,5.0658,0.7147,3.4775,0.9875,0.7976,0.0002,4.5538,1.6561,3.4355,0.1096,1.8142,3.7595,1.4237,1.123,2.7362,2.5449,2.4517,0.8662,0.0005,0.015,1.4621,1.1152,1.0222,0.789,6.2902,2.1947,0.018,0.4898,1.87,2.2154,4.6281,0.2488,3.2913,0.4035,3.1946,4.7965,4.4661,0.3382,3.5199,0.2813,2.0002,1.5959,0.0002,0.0037,3.7559,4.349,4.5412,2.6055,0.2124,2.211,3.1015,1.4575,3.2464,0.0354,1.9154,5.7844,4.5119,3.5424,3.2142,2.8021,1.5925,6.1095,3.1964,3.6035,2.2591,7.4687,0.4462,0.1517,0.0861,2.2334,5.3042,5.3756,0.0687,2.2464,2.2234,3.4527,2.1979,0.0177,0.8231,0.8864,0.8513,0.5409,0.4775,0.0002,2.3354,0.4423,0.0002,0.0035,1.6032,3.9341,2.4813,3.1126,5.1546,1.9733,0.1906,4.6981,3.8348,5.529,0.6468,5.2266,4.9139,3.3427,3.2682,0.712,2.2418,1.0626,0.0005,0.0025,6.3823,1.8244,3.3484,3.8186,2.8342,0.6256,3.3566,3.8751,0.2256,2.0602,0.0116,0.0759,0.4464,5.7525,1.3434,2.9005,0.0201,2.9047,1.0891,0.0021,0.0117,0.6642]}

Eu-hydronium can be dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (1 moles\/100g, 99.9% pure) with concentration 0.06 moles\/litre at 20 degrees C. This reaction is called EUT.\n\nExample of electroanalytical technique for the identification of Eu-hydronium in solution\n\nIn this experiment, 2.65 moles of 2 Eu-substituted H 3 (HCl) were added into 3 litre of water. At the same time, the solution was heated at 100 degrees C for 6 minutes. The HCl (HBr) was added. The two salts reacted with the salts of copper (CuCl), iron (Fe2+) and cobalt (CoCl 2 ) at different temperatures: 0, 15 and 45 degrees C. During this reaction, a dark brown precipitate of Eu-hydronium is formed. The precipitate was filtered off and stored for a few years at room temperature. The precipitate was removed and Eu-hydronium was detected by electrochemical analysis. Based on the colour, it could be separated into two compartments: the first contained silver (Ag1+), copper (CuCl2) and cobalt (CoCl2) and the second contained the white precipitate of europium. This separation could be done by measuring the Ag1+\/CuCl2 ratio: Ag1+\/CuCl2: Ag1+\/4Eu + 2Fe2 + 2 Br > Ag1+\/4Eu + Ag1+\/Ag1 + Ag1+ + Ag1, where 4Eu= 2 Eu + 2 HCl + 1 He + 1 Cl.\n\nThe electrochemical method was followed by a simple analysis:\n\n( 11 )\n\nThe Eu-hydronium concentration could be determined by spectrochemical analysis (see the example of Figure 3 below).","token_len":590,"entropy":[5.5618,5.6969,6.6412,7.5964,0.4778,7.3493,1.7902,8.2598,0.2698,10.2906,5.1211,9.9021,2.5121,3.9876,2.1776,7.4882,7.2347,6.8399,0.7105,9.8797,11.0262,2.8802,2.2581,2.8526,5.5147,1.6549,5.9984,0.6469,0.6359,0.1843,0.2694,0.2966,0.4485,4.2303,5.9442,8.6174,4.3541,7.6529,9.7675,0.0407,0.0006,2.7458,2.5179,4.4701,0.3668,2.8713,2.9221,3.9576,1.2539,2.1915,0.8404,2.7618,1.9393,2.193,4.9394,1.0499,1.9417,4.3431,0.2115,5.8875,0.9969,1.6815,5.2166,0.7393,0.2766,3.852,1.199,5.4437,3.8331,1.9333,0.0037,0.5939,1.5786,0.0231,5.1081,0.0623,5.6903,4.1077,1.4671,0.456,0.0031,2.6382,1.8794,0.0197,3.8634,2.2822,3.433,5.0582,0.0003,0.3455,2.2732,2.4258,0.0002,5.5866,0.1643,0.3104,3.353,0.0111,2.2881,0.6295,0.0461,0.0869,0.8566,5.6248,5.6442,0.6402,2.2167,0.1274,0.4116,1.1704,0.7661,2.4592,0.1448,1.9908,1.1948,0.7409,5.9056,0.8505,3.6183,2.6434,4.3369,5.312,3.6396,0.2932,2.0079,4.6521,4.1111,2.233,0.8409,0.4108,1.272,0.2774,0.5845,0.9348,0.1539,0.1479,1.6,0.0002,5.3546,5.8725,1.3925,3.0304,0.0182,3.476,3.1539,0.2357,0.0067,1.2927,3.2981,3.1611,0.1358,6.7386,1.0434,0.4225,3.9959,2.2107,1.1165,3.9189,5.469,3.1198,0.9042,0.0169,4.6763,0.988,0.0002,2.1626,0.729,0.7642,1.5445,0.0002,2.6587,5.3278,4.0343,2.7219,0.3483,2.1047,3.9512,0.5001,1.0673,2.8299,0.004,0.7419,0.1621,0.0055,0.0003,3.0087,1.2582,1.1448,4.8148,0.0304,0.4206,0.2331,0.0143,0.0005,2.9376,0.5777,3.1695,0.1572,4.7052,0.035,3.1749,0.3063,0.0285,0.6707,5.982,2.2208,0.5936,2.7936,3.2057,3.4251,3.8034,5.6706,0.6576,1.069,0.8554,2.0247,0.8195,3.762,5.1625,4.0165,0.0182,5.4618,1.9304,0.1008,0.2173,2.9146,0.0119,3.9121,2.1898,2.913,0.242,0.3884,3.0985,2.1111,1.3311,4.4398,3.5184,7.4361,1.4964,0.6748,0.0002,4.4299,3.352,6.3279,6.8908,0.3035,4.6429,1.1231,1.1939,2.5547,0.0299,2.4034,0.0913,0.5511,0.2077,0.0167,0.0006,2.043,1.1062,1.3104,0.0002,3.8231,1.4125,2.0348,0.7115,4.0515,1.3179,6.2675,2.9951,0.0327,0.0876,3.5812,2.3075,0.0072,0.1697,7.3198,0.0082,0.0291,0.0032,3.3326,3.8979,5.1524,2.8926,2.9665,0.3455,1.2326,1.8549,3.4199,4.6591,1.9542,1.2426,0.6859,2.1988,1.4641,4.0129,1.4264,1.2326,0.0213,0.2228,2.8725,2.391,0.2636,1.4292,1.5967,1.582,0.4168,0.0581,0.8601,3.9572,1.6345,0.4679,0.8932,4.0226,0.3206,3.4162,2.467,3.3993,0.1963,0.9415,1.7906,3.5981,0.8191,5.6503,4.4565,1.886,2.1768,1.3103,5.5226,0.5812,4.5023,1.4339,0.2746,2.8431,2.7433,2.6714,0.0812,0.0069,2.2146,0.2424,0.134,3.2705,0.0001,0.0559,0.2343,1.2225,1.4453,0.7579,2.7192,2.7018,2.4311,3.2432,3.3064,2.3743,4.1276,0.9184,3.1123,0.109,0.0136,0.2663,5.6415,2.0139,1.0078,0.3516,2.8936,4.6632,1.8684,0.4308,0.0082,1.5015,0.9539,0.0118,0.1006,0.1042,0.0036,0.0003,4.2385,0.244,0.4886,1.2479,1.07,0.033,1.993,3.166,2.1737,0.8184,4.2996,2.7872,3.5706,1.2607,4.761,1.4363,1.4226,0.0056,0.4293,1.5146,1.0988,0.019,0.7622,5.3052,1.071,5.1782,0.0261,0.0654,0.0859,0.0017,0.0002,0.9132,3.1461,0.7216,2.9182,0.4611,2.0287,0.4838,6.9668,0.0161,0.5452,5.1454,2.0426,2.6709,3.2046,0.0372,4.4252,0.5275,1.3853,5.9221,0.0074,0.8797,1.7318,2.2371,3.6721,5.2816,1.0491,0.1242,6.7093,1.2223,0.5928,1.3855,0.096,0.0368,1.8261,2.3611,0.8583,0.0749,1.2288,0.0,0.0382,0.0254,0.2122,0.3017,0.8158,0.6969,0.0638,0.1366,0.3127,3.1155,3.5775,0.3725,0.0171,0.7605,3.6338,0.0052,0.0002,1.2361,3.7484,2.2784,2.6099,0.1543,2.1519,0.8687,4.9993,0.1698,4.3306,1.342,0.0561,3.5136,0.3713,0.1387,0.0173,1.3448,4.0536,2.476,0.1241,0.1422,1.1949,0.0267,0.0571,0.0288,2.9051,3.262,0.1362,0.0161,0.2796,7.0917,3.2977,0.004,2.9141,1.6606,4.4823,1.0123,4.0556,1.3388,5.1572,2.9795,0.6049,0.0152,0.0141,0.0163,1.451,0.2203,0.0023,0.1707,3.3062,0.5479,0.1277,0.3443,3.2371,0.2937,2.6304,1.9109,0.0957,0.9273,2.2931,1.2221,0.093,7.214,1.7628,2.375,0.1109,0.0113,3.4847,3.1481,1.4324,0.0066,0.5523,1.5786,1.896,1.5164,2.2456,1.872,2.7843,1.5601,1.0127,1.7242,1.5552,0.8702,0.0002,2.0233,3.0977,0.1301,2.7918,1.968,3.9816,2.0164,2.7863,4.8503,3.1389,2.9891,1.8808,0.0002,1.1142,0.1163,0.0468,0.1471,0.0002,2.0488,2.718,0.1499,0.1142,0.1536,0.0067,0.0014,3.0634,3.9445,0.126,1.5619,0.6349,4.4773,3.2009,2.2116,0.4809,3.1221,2.2467,2.704,3.0177,1.8132,3.5691,2.1404,2.8178,0.3]}

{"id":2941,"ended":false,"length":528,"gen_text":"Wohlwend met Mike Boxleiter in an experimental video game development class they took together at Iowa State University. Wohlwend had attempted to help Boxleiter with a project, but quit after drawing a few \"too far\" in the extreme.\n\nThat's when the man who now runs YouTube's business and public relations arm met the woman who'd come to be his wife in the late 1990s as a computer science graduate student. They married after graduation and had three daughters.\n\nBoxleiter was the company's first employee, and Wohlwend remained on board for two years, while he tried his hand at software development and Web design. He continued to use the name Mike Boxleiter, but he eventually moved on to a new identity, \"Igor.\" Like Wohlwend, his online persona included a distinctive mustache.\n\nWohlwend's role has since moved to helping YouTube manage relationships with developers and publishers, but he says he's stayed involved with the company long enough to get it to where it is today.\n\nWhat YouTube's founders have failed to figure out is how to stay popular without advertising. \"It used to be you went and sold videos on YouTube for $15 a pop, like YouTube Red. But that's starting to change. No one's making money on YouTube anymore,\" Wohlwend says. The site is so successful because YouTube has so many advertisers, he explains. \"That's just money in the bank, and they don't want to touch it.\"\n\nWohlwend says most people on YouTube are willing to contribute to the community that makes the site work. But many will only watch if ads are present.\n\nIt's not a problem, Wohlwend says, because people on YouTube still love YouTube and want to keep playing on it. One way they do that is by downloading YouTube's own YouTube Red channel \u2014 which is the same channel that's offering users a free month of advertising time on April 1.\n\nWohlwend says YouTube Red helps ensure that people who can't afford to pay for YouTube's service will get access to its video library, which includes thousands of hours of programming.\n\nWohlwend sees the move to ad-free as a major step toward YouTube becoming a self-sustaining service, and one he's optimistic will turn a profit eventually.

{"id":2428,"ended":true,"length":550,"gen_text":"According to West Virginia state law, the desecration of either the flag of the United States or the West Virginia state flag is an offense punishable as a misdemeanor and upon conviction, a fine not to exceed $1,000 or imprisonment not to exceed 6 months\n\nThe case is scheduled to be heard in Charleston next month.\n\n\"We are glad the West Virginia prosecutors are moving forward on prosecuting this case,\" Robert O'Hara, senior counsel for the group said.\n\n\"This is yet another strong message that no matter where you live you have the right to protest. In the United States, you have the right to criticize the government, but not to desecrate our flag; particularly when there were peaceful protests in West Virginia over our state flag.\"\n\nWest Virginia's Supreme Court struck down the law after a lawsuit, saying that it violated a provision of the First Amendment which protects freedoms of speech and religion, but not freedom of the press, and protected the right to be free from flag desecration.\n\nBut the case has led to demonstrations outside some of the state's courthouses. In response, the West Virginia law was revised. A new amendment added to the new law says: \"No person shall publicly or privately burn, shred or desecrate a United States flag\"\n\nIn 2011, a Tennessee man was found guilty of burning the American flag on public land after a rally where he criticised President Barack Obama. He said: \"If we're going to lose the country, let it be on our terms. Let the American people find the freedom they need.\"\n\nThe case of a Virginia-based woman whose daughter was prosecuted for removing a large Confederate flag from her yard caused a furor last year. In that case, a grand jury returned an indictment charging Mary Stapleton, a mother in Rockingham County, Virginia, with a third-degree felony, punishable by up to three years in prison, for her daughter Jessica Kelley's actions.\n\nThe case was brought after Kelley removed the flag, which was covered in political slogans, from their window during a protest against the murder in August of a member of a white supremacist group. Kelley pleaded guilty to the charge and said she did it to prevent any misunderstandings between her and her friends about her political views. She was sentenced in December to three months' home detention.\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on 11 October 2013. In the original we said that the case of a Tennessee man who burned the flag of the United States on public land after a rally where he criticised President Barack Obama was brought after a protest against the murder of a member of a white supremacist group. The case was brought after a rally of more than 300 people at John Paul Jones Arena in the city of Knoxville, Tennessee, against the murder of an African-American man by three police officers on 15 August 2013. This has been corrected.","token_len":592,"entropy":[0.0086,8.1958,1.9702,4.112,1.1232,0.0601,2.1572,11.1892,0.184,0.0177,0.1886,6.5416,1.5163,1.794,1.3837,0.1124,0.2499,0.0093,0.4244,0.6449,4.3281,0.015,0.4041,0.0304,0.6812,4.1696,0.595,0.3922,5.1045,0.0355,1.8598,3.5137,6.3451,0.0224,1.2637,1.68,0.5058,1.8771,0.7705,0.0008,0.0996,1.3792,0.001,0.0378,1.5877,0.384,1.2226,0.3801,0.0038,2.1741,0.0042,7.9655,0.0017,1.9427,5.4748,1.9283,3.3123,0.6936,0.5322,0.5094,1.0977,2.489,4.3269,0.7821,0.2764,0.6984,0.0002,3.1662,2.1805,1.6434,4.919,1.7391,3.3797,0.0323,6.5518,1.0853,3.0681,0.3041,2.209,4.1392,0.5785,0.9646,0.8661,6.3875,3.6671,0.1709,0.4333,0.38,0.1007,3.8316,0.7341,0.8021,0.3448,5.3827,4.024,0.9207,1.111,0.0002,0.5727,2.4947,0.9565,3.3346,0.0448,6.3664,2.5994,0.8992,3.6129,0.9409,1.9309,0.4205,1.4117,3.9551,1.7478,0.3739,0.2183,0.0228,2.2639,3.2868,4.1176,1.7198,1.6528,0.0028,0.732,2.2572,0.6912,0.3162,0.1438,0.0226,5.0477,0.9174,0.5425,1.5526,1.7699,1.8314,0.3486,1.0833,0.0001,0.0003,1.9983,0.8662,6.4558,6.6851,1.1534,3.0398,5.3601,5.1718,0.677,1.9075,2.2895,0.0103,3.4204,5.2205,1.1447,0.3742,1.4906,0.426,0.0002,3.5973,0.0278,1.8923,4.8195,0.0046,4.0588,0.0065,0.713,2.1876,3.8258,1.1676,2.6764,4.1322,2.1458,1.8588,1.195,0.9712,4.4632,4.3953,0.4348,0.0969,1.9965,0.0293,2.5457,1.4618,6.1018,0.0147,0.1057,0.4982,1.6832,2.9222,3.3377,1.653,2.1102,0.1086,1.628,0.0546,3.2236,1.7843,4.9543,1.1806,0.6212,0.5503,4.4579,0.3493,0.3225,4.1459,0.1563,0.0001,0.0202,0.2943,0.2811,0.0002,4.502,0.8034,3.439,1.3631,5.0471,0.1309,4.7944,2.688,5.7691,1.4965,0.2546,0.7656,0.1348,0.7013,0.0,0.0005,1.5528,3.3903,4.3965,0.6182,0.8195,1.8198,0.0069,5.0893,0.5731,3.3331,2.4721,4.4482,1.1189,3.4981,3.1502,1.892,0.1846,5.2012,0.4993,1.817,1.5359,0.3673,1.655,0.1967,0.388,3.8587,2.6963,0.0474,2.4524,0.1599,4.8482,1.7063,3.1117,0.0004,0.0003,2.3118,2.8966,0.003,0.1001,4.2534,1.8507,0.0002,2.979,3.9795,0.287,1.5184,5.5762,0.9471,0.3679,2.8468,0.0744,0.1402,1.11,0.7766,1.1071,0.012,2.4603,3.2558,1.3682,1.9441,2.1965,4.9891,4.3104,1.274,5.8912,2.0946,0.5846,0.0008,0.6169,2.2006,4.7798,3.0937,0.0172,3.1719,2.1886,2.6118,0.799,0.0344,4.6618,2.054,1.4442,0.4165,1.6849,1.0581,0.386,1.4257,0.8013,3.1528,1.7921,1.3799,2.7701,2.4307,0.4932,6.3406,3.5048,4.9171,1.6403,1.4123,1.2746,0.5856,0.0002,1.7789,2.9142,2.2883,2.6917,3.5876,6.5029,0.0932,4.1071,5.1193,4.3254,0.5487,4.6571,0.4953,5.3413,1.1556,4.4559,1.3804,0.1851,0.1987,0.4038,4.0895,4.8396,1.2119,3.5487,0.0006,2.3318,0.2885,0.6202,3.5024,1.3456,0.0915,0.1438,1.7039,3.4254,0.0055,3.7809,0.658,0.0208,2.238,5.2409,5.8788,4.1382,0.0144,1.9033,1.8631,2.0146,3.2859,5.5183,0.3363,0.0657,0.1147,0.8262,0.1066,0.0672,3.1232,3.6763,0.3827,0.006,0.1258,2.4732,0.9405,0.0226,0.2196,0.0036,2.7167,0.035,0.0926,0.2809,0.9651,0.4282,3.4837,0.2369,7.2033,3.2909,0.1614,1.862,0.4046,0.4361,0.0002,1.4843,2.4944,1.6031,2.9428,1.1566,1.3513,2.2776,0.4615,0.5188,1.8966,0.7469,1.6279,3.7229,1.0091,3.888,2.3178,0.814,0.2867,3.875,6.2529,4.184,0.6015,1.6118,1.4109,0.4639,2.7877,3.8944,2.7636,0.4619,2.1825,5.186,0.0025,1.5497,2.0922,0.1856,0.7034,1.2064,2.7944,4.5226,0.1648,0.4865,1.9194,0.9868,0.9741,3.5255,0.5441,2.1135,1.2376,1.1164,3.9271,4.3912,6.3185,0.0001,2.0956,0.8946,0.9382,0.7993,4.3483,3.1751,2.0711,1.0981,0.6056,0.1103,2.9027,1.0174,1.5002,2.7857,2.0307,0.5172,2.4622,0.7516,2.0551,1.7164,0.2009,1.3308,0.5046,0.0002,5.4403,0.1601,0.053,0.0089,0.0258,0.0044,3.4775,2.628,1.1374,0.4805,2.8778,0.3479,0.3387,4.3298,0.4356,0.7899,1.0244,2.8905,1.5559,0.7486,1.4865,0.5635,0.6988,0.9317,0.2425,4.0434,2.8802,0.1052,0.6974,0.0044,0.8286,0.0736,0.0116,1.4116,0.0185,0.0193,0.173,0.002,0.0517,0.0498,0.1019,0.0003,0.5582,0.2137,0.8837,0.4161,1.8807,0.9779,0.1885,0.043,1.1962,0.1443,0.0948,0.0026,0.07,0.0164,0.0089,0.0052,0.185,2.2431,1.4621,0.2888,0.1426,0.1573,0.267,1.0491,4.0532,3.9739,0.0409,2.7257,0.2435,3.4982,7.6917,0.7472,0.0036,0.1318,0.381,3.9947,1.1381,0.0311,1.3577,0.0004,1.175,0.6027,0.8075,3.2254,0.1991,0.2367,0.2546,3.6175,0.7594,0.6354,0.0034,0.3339,0.5485,3.598,3.8751,0.0042,3.4563,3.6869,0.1435,2.2601,0.1398,1.8403,0.0383,0.0169,0.1397,0.1178]}
{"id":730,"ended":false,"length":504,"gen_text":"After the Crusaders were succeeded by the Ayyubids and then the Mamluks, the Ottoman Empire conquered Palestine in 1517, and Jifna came under their control for the following 400 years. In 1596, after three decades in control of the city, Mamluk sultan Mehmed b. al-Din al-Kamil sacked it.\n\nAn Ottoman governor led a revolt against Mamluk sultan Mahmud II. After his death in 1612, the newly formed Ottoman sultanate overran Jifna and most of Palestine. The remainder of Palestine was then under the protection of the Caliph Abd-al-Malik. On 11 December 1798, he invaded the Ottoman Empire; he never came back. It was only after the second world war, the creation of Israel, and the establishment of the State of Israel that the rest of Palestine was conquered.\n\nJifna has remained the administrative center of Jerusalem for the last 500 years. Today it is the most populated Jerusalem neighborhood with 8,000 inhabitants. About 75% of Jifna's population lives below the poverty line, and a quarter live in public housing. Only about 20% of the population receive salaries from the State of Israel, with the rest of the city's residents depending on remittances from relatives living overseas.\n\nIn the first centuries, the area which is today Jifna was a farming region, and the site of a fortress, where the first Jewish settlement in Israel had been established in 629. The fortress had survived for two centuries because of its position on a ridge, preventing the Persians from besieging it. By the 11th century, it had become a city with a large population. The city then fell into the hands of the Crusaders, and in 1099 the Templars attacked it at the beginning of the 13th century. The city was sacked in 1144 during crusades undertaken by the Catholic king Henry III. At this time, the city had a population of about 10,000. The city was rebuilt in order to protect its position when it was given over to the Mamluks in 1180.\n\nJifna, which was captured until the middle of the 16th century, was completely rebuilt under the Ottomans. In addition to its historical importance, Jifna is also one of the most beautiful neighborhoods in the city. There is a large park at the northwest corner of the city, the Old City, which is situated to the north of the Old Market Place. This area has a large Arab population who, although speaking Arabic, are quite assimilated and mostly are not aware that they live in Jifna. Jifna is also home to a number of schools, some of which are affiliated with the Israeli authorities.\n\nThe Israeli tourist board's website describes Jifna as a typical Muslim immigrant neighborhood in Israel:","token_len":592,"entropy":[1.9443,10.0827,1.354,2.7309,9.553,0.2279,0.4835,7.7597,0.2828,0.0251,0.2544,3.7617,2.7106,0.7917,1.9157,0.0287,0.1612,0.263,0.9598,3.9295,0.4755,4.7929,3.6782,1.7531,1.7734,0.178,1.6795,1.7902,8.9359,10.3528,6.0744,4.7932,0.1779,2.9317,0.8272,4.6007,0.7129,5.0096,4.8864,0.0137,0.1827,2.6754,2.9778,5.742,0.4128,3.2004,4.9813,2.3717,3.5398,2.9695,0.9766,0.6504,1.3966,0.1059,5.4128,0.0026,0.2078,2.0795,0.133,4.4813,0.1913,7.1783,0.0073,2.276,0.0215,0.8829,0.0618,2.5294,0.0057,1.8686,2.0497,0.2006,4.5759,1.675,1.1343,1.8463,0.0126,5.7018,1.2939,5.4582,4.121,1.096,3.3169,1.1864,2.8175,0.0017,0.1466,1.9262,0.0082,2.53,0.0316,0.3483,2.7421,3.2771,3.1799,0.8218,0.9742,0.5153,4.2424,0.0626,0.9565,6.54,3.3302,0.3528,2.359,0.0372,0.2956,5.6693,0.0241,2.2368,0.0171,0.0017,1.2686,4.9607,0.0401,1.0461,0.6694,1.7294,5.0485,0.2111,1.2634,0.8673,4.7165,2.0477,0.8391,3.4079,0.0067,0.2617,5.8044,0.4358,3.9303,2.4674,0.4325,0.2353,0.3075,0.005,1.6111,6.0877,5.1799,2.9305,1.7926,1.8581,0.0935,2.9119,4.2178,2.061,2.3085,0.903,6.1893,2.3793,5.3918,3.1957,0.8104,0.2092,5.2009,0.8042,2.6948,1.391,0.427,5.614,0.7733,0.0034,2.2249,4.3121,2.4986,0.0075,0.4847,0.7118,0.2586,0.1713,1.7581,0.0152,0.3276,1.0306,0.001,0.0373,0.4083,0.9975,4.7746,0.013,0.2286,0.6821,3.933,1.4041,0.3646,0.0002,2.0579,0.239,0.002,2.9168,3.4469,3.0729,4.635,1.6804,0.1389,3.7382,2.2832,1.0599,1.5472,2.92,0.0067,0.4678,2.3859,1.5497,0.4028,1.7552,2.4598,3.6893,6.6358,1.5269,2.3919,5.6486,0.4286,0.6035,1.0837,0.4428,5.7845,4.6069,0.6137,0.0264,2.8212,0.0084,0.0042,0.4398,1.3807,2.8867,2.2677,0.053,0.0458,0.0914,1.542,1.0183,3.7224,2.3126,2.461,1.1081,4.407,0.193,0.3921,4.4209,2.6371,2.4567,0.0613,0.1437,0.6842,1.4321,5.8986,3.5444,0.8335,0.3396,5.3538,0.2745,0.0162,1.8898,3.5666,0.5105,0.431,2.231,0.2044,2.9491,0.2671,1.0138,3.8799,0.1129,5.8204,0.024,0.0001,0.458,0.9809,1.9473,4.3163,0.2192,0.6536,0.0002,3.1085,1.8165,4.2892,5.0996,3.1917,1.4483,2.6732,6.353,1.1,0.9583,0.3577,0.0179,0.0006,0.2877,1.8499,5.394,2.9748,1.526,1.7227,1.5801,4.2251,0.0729,1.5825,5.1281,2.2795,3.8294,0.958,2.9267,2.4591,2.4067,0.9871,2.9214,5.3579,0.6773,0.4098,2.0463,4.621,4.6544,1.3029,1.6626,2.1262,4.0259,5.7336,2.656,3.9117,0.416,5.1754,0.6495,0.9961,2.9141,1.0182,1.16,3.4977,2.2687,5.4367,1.1522,5.3786,0.0008,0.4003,2.7296,0.0001,0.4851,0.3794,4.4864,0.3968,3.4028,0.0109,0.0275,0.2212,2.1764,0.9972,0.7082,0.5319,3.1435,2.6805,0.8029,2.5309,2.2168,1.0295,1.9481,2.3952,5.6703,3.3464,1.2143,2.2839,0.0208,0.0007,0.3078,2.0371,0.0144,1.0402,2.0185,2.4753,2.1244,1.0275,1.494,5.9125,0.0009,4.875,0.8989,6.268,0.717,3.3063,0.0016,0.169,4.8141,0.0035,0.0178,0.2205,1.4205,1.7593,0.7382,2.2477,1.7573,1.3243,2.4726,3.9783,6.6103,3.004,5.6929,0.203,0.6066,4.2425,4.4495,2.8694,1.1658,1.1856,5.0834,2.7647,0.2984,0.3761,1.139,1.1042,2.0684,1.081,0.447,0.0245,1.2964,3.1861,0.0091,0.0093,1.0588,1.8519,1.7895,0.7673,2.062,1.4914,5.4363,0.0289,2.375,3.2322,4.7925,6.7702,1.7527,0.5389,5.8009,3.2971,0.0474,0.2148,3.142,0.0004,0.3725,1.0434,3.6708,3.9314,0.3234,1.0819,0.0002,2.0774,0.1357,0.0012,3.8445,2.2455,1.5936,4.4986,7.77,0.9334,2.8404,0.0468,0.063,2.4994,0.0022,0.006,0.5658,0.844,4.9647,1.776,4.1985,0.7259,1.7685,0.0035,0.0003,0.7741,2.1908,3.3008,0.2497,2.404,3.4867,0.7676,0.3014,0.8036,0.0037,0.001,0.9599,1.7521,2.5813,0.0054,0.0646,0.9553,1.8446,1.2393,0.2707,1.3038,0.6521,0.5458,4.4432,1.4568,0.4157,2.1046,2.3455,3.7787,0.3251,5.3803,0.4353,0.0775,0.2427,1.1076,0.5673,3.79,3.259,0.346,1.6028,1.0131,1.1348,5.1561,4.2182,0.0379,1.2904,0.3503,0.5432,1.5783,2.803,4.117,0.7558,2.9803,1.3288,2.365,1.2402,2.56,5.068,0.4294,3.2825,4.2741,2.8316,5.8241,0.9524,0.16,1.6897,4.9835,2.9472,0.0023,1.8154,4.8502,5.4826,1.3552,2.6744,2.4468,0.9683,0.8382,0.1648,2.423,0.0124,0.0007,0.1996,3.168,0.0313,0.0025,0.9196,1.2205,1.9001,0.0084,1.4498,1.9638,0.0019,4.3368,1.0729,3.9553,0.3434,0.1361,0.7395,3.4617,0.0637,0.4775,2.7947,4.6438,0.3239,0.6303,0.0002,1.7666,5.0107,5.311,2.8287,3.2533,0.7207,2.3471,0.4791,0.0055,0.0007,0.3057,1.8815,5.4169,4.1576,6.6484,0.58,2.2431,3.3399,2.2124]}
{"id":3628,"ended":true,"length":476,"gen_text":"The bigeye thresher has larger teeth than other threshers and feeds on a wider variety of prey. Known food items include schooling forage fish such as mackerel and herring, benthic fishes such as cod and herring, sardines, crayfish (like barracuda ), squid and anchovies. Many fish are also eaten by tuna threshers.\n\nLife cycle\n\nThe bigeye thresher is part of the larger fish community that includes herring, mackerel, sardines and anchovies. Threshers have a special bony structure called a pectoral fin called pectoralis major. The pectoralis major is longer than most pectoral fins of other fish but is only about 2 to 6 mm long. This difference in length makes threshers more easily identified than other long bodied fish.\n\nOnce the bigeye thresher has finished feeding, it will go into the deep sea to hide away from the light. It will stay out of the way of predators using its pectoralis major to extend its body during the night so it can swim stealthily to the deep ocean. Threshers live in groups of from 50 to 300. Occasionally, one individual will venture out to eat when it is very crowded. Males use their pectoralis major to defend their territories, which may last from a few weeks to several months.\n\nThreshers are known to make their nests by pulling on the legs of anchovies and anchovy larvae swimming over the seabed. Large thresher nests are sometimes found in rocky outcrops, caves and in shallow-water areas. Threshers are very active during the day and, therefore, can be spotted using sonar on boats and in fishing trawlers.\n\nFood\n\nAlthough the size of their stomachs means that threshers have to eat a lot, they enjoy eating a variety of different prey items. Bigeye threshers eat cod over a period of several months while smaller threshers eat perch longer. In general, perch is good for threshers because it is easy to catch, it is large enough for them to dig into and the prey can be quickly digested and used as additional calories.\n\nThreshers do not eat fish whole. They can eat large fish whole and some fish such as tuna fish are eaten whole and can be very large pieces of fish. Bigeye threshers also eat many prawns and some lobster. Bigeye threshers prefer herring as their prey. Herring is not as abundant as cod, herring usually live out long periods of time in the ocean and when they are caught, they are often quite large. One of the largest Atlantic salmon caught ever was more than 3,000 kg (631 lbs) and weighed over 3 tonnes.","token_len":593,"entropy":[7.0122,12.4434,6.2593,0.15,0.0253,3.4832,7.7328,1.5073,0.6471,2.3465,2.3833,0.0003,0.4534,1.7489,6.4043,0.5915,3.0597,2.2738,0.6327,0.0038,1.0343,1.1412,7.5267,8.9611,0.8037,0.2014,9.3517,8.4855,1.6411,0.2193,2.218,0.0022,3.8955,0.0031,0.0001,1.1633,1.8472,0.0785,0.6251,5.7736,1.1735,0.0181,3.8336,0.9117,0.0012,3.9769,0.7018,1.9422,0.0121,0.1201,5.2701,0.0519,0.1758,0.2506,6.057,0.0134,0.0185,4.4981,3.6891,4.8969,0.0899,0.2292,7.1254,3.4693,1.7173,4.1955,0.079,0.4339,5.9394,3.4209,1.885,1.5269,1.3685,1.091,5.0909,0.5483,0.0001,0.0528,0.7653,1.1703,0.0202,4.6237,1.7248,0.4335,0.0003,1.4646,0.7288,0.0046,0.0425,0.0001,0.0045,1.327,5.777,0.0323,0.7095,4.6141,3.5654,5.1462,1.8426,1.1492,4.6441,0.0709,0.6231,0.8521,0.0,0.0,0.276,2.376,0.0003,0.0356,1.5061,1.0499,0.0236,0.229,4.0009,0.0044,0.2806,2.9746,1.1849,5.3575,5.7335,0.9387,1.0635,1.331,0.8901,4.2288,0.0832,0.0184,0.2118,3.1614,4.3195,0.023,0.0106,0.8233,1.8767,1.1913,1.7765,0.3281,0.0023,0.0013,0.4333,0.0793,0.6297,4.9754,1.0196,3.9621,4.2401,0.0282,0.0019,0.1206,1.9093,0.3505,0.5935,4.3995,1.4721,3.4239,2.0075,2.7959,2.3404,3.5521,2.4321,0.3469,0.3209,2.135,5.5194,0.6321,0.7087,2.3424,3.1258,0.013,0.2039,2.0781,3.4843,2.5216,4.4815,0.3704,6.9755,6.092,0.0001,0.5357,0.4807,1.2517,0.0002,5.8823,1.2334,1.2826,0.0086,0.0671,0.0003,0.015,1.5452,3.5785,0.8628,0.5248,0.2109,1.8555,3.3855,1.6815,1.1408,2.0939,1.9902,1.5882,3.7038,3.1601,1.3501,2.2671,3.69,0.818,1.6642,1.0812,2.7501,2.743,0.5857,0.6038,1.4194,0.3212,1.6252,6.9448,0.6495,1.0989,0.001,0.0005,1.7457,0.0875,0.869,5.69,0.7953,1.704,6.5017,0.7676,1.0769,4.1916,0.8529,0.7619,3.5126,3.9934,0.0041,3.2659,1.1782,2.2029,1.6545,1.5076,2.9968,0.0027,0.0284,4.0388,1.4029,3.5718,0.609,4.3794,3.2552,0.0416,2.2217,2.5967,6.0311,0.9129,2.4892,2.8352,0.8001,4.591,0.5918,1.355,3.8276,5.1821,1.8274,0.9244,4.5987,5.4408,0.4848,6.3089,5.5288,0.5434,0.6514,0.0016,0.0006,0.423,0.1138,0.2812,3.2614,1.0796,0.9838,2.6909,2.9762,2.5336,3.6056,2.232,1.2218,0.169,1.7471,0.048,1.0053,1.2824,0.1319,0.9516,0.0002,1.039,0.0061,0.1353,1.1938,3.4984,0.211,5.5396,2.582,1.2762,4.2402,5.5057,3.9054,1.0917,4.2115,0.1204,6.3845,0.0412,1.3904,1.9567,0.5138,1.4308,5.5532,5.0408,0.64,2.6593,0.0036,0.0016,0.2563,5.3462,2.6995,0.0098,1.8505,0.8304,1.1276,3.4829,1.1408,1.2349,3.3847,2.4834,0.0126,0.0849,2.6259,2.7061,1.0493,3.4406,3.5541,5.3802,0.1274,1.5933,0.7042,2.6435,0.0133,0.1241,2.0076,3.0903,3.1017,1.1478,0.2147,0.6106,0.847,5.6495,4.2404,0.0094,3.1612,0.6414,3.3518,4.4767,1.6564,0.0037,5.2317,3.5834,1.8663,2.4241,2.6214,2.203,0.0167,0.8509,0.1185,0.6213,0.0002,4.5871,1.1028,0.0002,4.5713,1.6272,4.9657,0.2796,4.4427,2.399,0.6821,3.4922,0.7029,0.8068,0.0016,0.0223,3.0271,1.1883,0.5699,0.7425,0.6058,1.4207,0.5861,5.9854,1.0018,1.1161,1.2186,0.0014,2.8563,1.9823,1.4565,0.3439,3.3765,0.0707,0.0054,0.0012,0.0345,1.9497,4.9069,8.119,1.6518,0.9259,0.0145,1.0556,1.1184,2.9875,2.352,0.2055,0.0034,0.0571,1.6838,6.3698,0.0232,6.9234,1.6365,3.6953,3.4579,0.1046,5.5213,0.0082,1.2143,6.1493,1.605,0.3968,0.0041,0.0395,0.7003,0.4677,0.5524,2.0676,0.0724,0.4909,1.7088,3.0562,0.4778,4.1073,1.3443,2.0895,0.7619,0.0251,6.8584,1.0315,0.7045,3.3446,3.3129,2.7249,0.4772,3.6171,0.946,0.0001,3.0267,4.0438,1.3159,5.2817,4.3983,0.3044,0.9444,0.0002,1.154,0.0074,0.0568,4.8806,0.1452,1.248,2.1588,3.183,1.3331,1.4449,4.7266,1.4545,2.8131,1.3574,2.6506,2.4557,3.9403,2.1104,2.8002,0.0016,2.152,5.826,1.7631,1.6087,0.4628,3.0537,4.5586,0.3389,3.4031,2.0046,4.1573,1.2803,1.103,0.1647,3.8273,0.072,0.0056,0.0011,0.0193,1.8748,0.3719,4.3976,6.5997,0.3494,0.0308,1.2016,4.0338,5.1286,0.6025,4.4317,0.0659,0.0065,0.002,0.0222,4.1118,6.028,0.0299,3.3528,0.7064,2.8316,1.7917,2.174,0.0426,0.6042,3.6935,1.529,3.715,0.7126,1.0812,2.1944,1.9094,0.015,5.198,4.9299,4.9425,8.0258,0.9924,0.6178,0.0882,1.22,0.4888,1.7578,0.9267,3.8253,1.0105,0.9663,1.0425,1.24,0.752,0.5813,1.9433,3.6232,0.6497,0.4188,6.022,1.5252,0.0854,3.129,5.369,4.2088,0.4862,5.6424,0.4406,4.2267,0.0082,2.973,3.0014,0.5884,0.6713,0.9796,0.9691,7.6698,0.9557,0.9123,0.6366,1.9368,2.3712,2.566,1.5377,0.5519]}

{"id":4909,"ended":false,"length":498,"gen_text":"Glycerolipids are composed of mono-, di-, and tri @ - @ substituted < unk >, the best @ - @ known being the fatty acid triesters of glycerol, called triglycerides.\n\nGlycerolipids have been shown to be able to bind to platelets -- in other words, cholesterol and other lipids -- and to block their ability to move through the artery wall as they flow into other organs.\n\nGlycerolipid binding to platelets and its subsequent resistance to flow is well documented, and the main reason for this is that the triglycerides themselves form what is called a polymer network, or covalent bond with the platelets.\n\nIn this manner, platelets bind to the triglycerides, binding to the proteins with which they are bound, which in turn is what restricts the flow of platelets, making the artery wall a barrier to them.\n\nThe barrier protects against an even heavier concentration of cholesterol in the bloodstream, increasing the risk of heart attack. As cholesterol increases, there's a natural tendency to produce cholesterol plaques, so some of the arteries begin secreting more cholesterol, which in turn can also decrease their resistance to flow.\n\nCholesterol-Lowering Drugs\n\nThere are 2 drugs that have been very effective at removing cholesterol from the body, one of which is called Atorvastatin (brand name Crestor).\n\nOther drugs that can lower cholesterol include aspirin, drugs called statins (like Lipitor) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (aspirin and rofecoxib). The latter 2 are known as simvastatin and rosuvastatin, respectively; it's also possible, though seldom seen by physicians, for people on diuretics to produce sufficient pressure inside veins to reduce the formation of platelets and their resistance to flow.\n\nIt's important to note that lowering high cholesterol doesn't always mean lowering LDL cholesterol. People on statins generally have lower LDL cholesterol; the other 3 drugs that have been shown to lower cholesterol include apixaban, bococizumab, and infliximab.\n\nBlood Testing\n\nWith all of the studies mentioned above, doctors can measure total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol with standard blood tests. However, sometimes you may not be satisfied with standard cholesterol testing. For example, some people with high blood pressure test for higher levels of cholesterol. Others have an elevated LDL cholesterol level but test low on total cholesterol tests -- this is considered a \"mild\" LDL cholesterol level, and is usually found by taking a high level of cholesterol to a lower level before blood testing.\n\nYou can often take cholesterol supplements that are derived from animal sources to increase total and LDL cholesterol levels. However, it's always important for you to stay active and eat well so that your cholesterol improves over time.\n\n\nAdditional Reading:","token_len":594,"entropy":[10.074,1.1257,7.798,0.1845,3.0295,3.9577,0.1616,6.7725,2.1693,0.016,0.2278,1.2767,0.3371,15.7446,4.8351,13.4523,10.2211,7.6905,9.5475,6.5326,3.3293,5.7008,6.264,7.1021,7.6603,4.4869,2.5116,6.5314,5.6176,2.8051,3.4213,0.3227,13.8163,1.8561,2.4496,3.2891,0.0318,0.1,2.2797,4.8485,2.6996,0.0972,0.3506,2.5918,0.0109,3.1099,0.2196,0.1502,1.0682,0.0269,2.9443,2.26,2.2653,0.0806,1.2861,3.9705,0.0232,3.0444,1.1849,5.7364,0.236,7.5548,4.175,3.1259,0.0113,0.0908,6.0742,2.8308,0.9102,0.8996,0.3732,0.7853,0.9974,1.8956,3.3468,2.1108,1.1716,0.0052,4.1336,1.8814,0.3166,3.4875,0.5597,5.404,1.9839,4.9241,2.9767,5.3864,2.3579,0.4827,1.1904,0.0002,3.1408,0.2486,0.0705,0.2702,3.0621,2.7708,1.0175,0.4948,0.0251,3.402,4.513,3.0905,6.4912,0.1012,1.7575,2.2216,5.4676,1.6067,2.1295,1.1658,2.5173,4.9761,2.0642,1.369,1.7074,1.3079,0.9187,1.4012,1.9909,0.6488,3.1674,4.0148,4.704,1.0389,0.7152,0.3989,5.3827,2.9683,1.5,2.5083,4.0748,0.2245,0.0583,0.3727,4.0671,0.7672,0.7589,0.5678,0.4732,0.6629,0.0002,2.9067,2.8968,4.3858,0.0877,4.8582,0.0642,3.4483,0.4008,0.7076,0.6157,0.2574,1.1014,5.6732,1.6855,1.0859,4.3843,4.9537,0.1728,0.1815,0.7741,1.5082,0.624,3.2061,0.9411,0.0238,4.4335,1.6711,5.1785,0.5796,0.551,0.0683,2.7534,0.0868,3.1761,3.8352,1.6954,1.9169,0.8331,4.7123,3.6308,0.5767,5.3418,0.4188,0.1798,0.0002,2.2578,5.3565,6.3013,2.5914,4.3641,4.6701,5.6855,2.7853,0.014,1.2809,2.0751,0.0923,1.3667,0.8105,5.5716,0.2401,0.6948,0.1715,1.1977,0.9136,1.2733,5.2933,2.74,3.2942,0.4539,4.1521,2.5992,1.3292,5.0331,0.7416,1.1477,3.3123,5.0843,4.1141,0.0023,1.5825,4.539,6.1072,2.3288,0.3224,5.1132,4.2916,5.9619,0.0001,0.0,1.0884,0.4634,1.536,1.2766,2.4001,0.0335,3.7411,4.1077,5.4327,3.0575,3.2279,0.1229,0.5035,0.2368,0.1498,0.0003,3.9968,0.0138,2.581,2.5211,0.0012,0.9126,0.5121,0.0003,3.2408,0.3565,6.7996,2.1631,1.0633,1.5267,0.188,5.5256,0.6365,1.8886,6.1874,1.4048,0.1659,0.1524,1.6236,1.4956,3.659,0.9824,0.3455,0.4245,1.6309,5.1807,0.0031,0.0001,0.0001,0.0017,1.0821,2.5758,0.12,1.7294,0.0005,0.62,0.8567,0.0002,3.7149,0.7951,1.0894,2.5697,1.0583,0.2388,0.5833,5.9933,0.3439,5.2352,1.8594,1.0275,0.0372,1.6038,2.2573,0.4613,0.005,1.4854,0.3087,4.6332,0.0055,0.0006,0.008,0.7993,0.0366,0.0002,0.3438,0.3739,0.3558,5.4619,0.62,0.0038,1.4956,2.0004,2.1041,0.0012,0.0003,0.0,0.5874,3.9351,1.7001,1.4765,1.3232,2.9086,0.2753,6.1209,0.0004,0.0001,0.0,0.8747,1.8215,0.0589,0.0003,0.0,0.0,0.6775,1.4078,5.2516,4.5439,0.8489,2.742,1.0944,4.5453,1.5068,6.4937,1.951,6.5612,1.5732,0.0623,2.8195,2.5533,3.6128,4.2969,0.4585,0.051,0.5873,3.0676,4.8547,6.3922,2.5337,7.6903,0.2729,3.2421,1.1323,5.14,0.0114,3.5708,0.0768,1.9708,2.6257,2.2067,0.0666,0.198,0.2042,0.13,0.0003,3.7242,0.4468,1.3792,0.0916,0.608,0.1406,3.6038,5.5754,0.457,2.6662,0.0005,2.0619,1.4651,1.1098,1.4818,1.008,0.8773,4.5344,2.676,0.4275,0.3134,5.6721,0.6057,2.3147,0.6507,0.5257,5.0321,2.8509,4.714,4.8112,2.9515,2.6672,2.5535,0.273,0.9827,0.0442,0.5155,0.4283,2.7956,4.8873,0.051,0.0009,1.324,5.5981,0.8336,0.0052,0.0069,0.0,0.4303,0.1272,4.6948,0.0005,0.0,0.0001,0.1851,0.3627,0.0003,4.9228,5.1618,0.4728,0.0002,5.4162,2.3495,0.7594,0.7925,5.0574,3.6436,0.5765,0.2898,3.758,2.5191,3.5347,4.6906,0.1029,1.5594,0.3409,0.1739,3.238,4.0095,0.6357,0.1136,0.5667,1.9728,0.0105,4.9652,4.8236,0.9946,1.9992,1.2879,3.7375,0.046,3.8063,2.6639,1.3424,1.2857,2.9623,0.4629,0.0175,2.4928,1.1919,2.6895,0.8357,2.3629,0.6884,6.0235,4.3076,5.7725,1.6042,0.0795,1.9008,2.5823,3.5662,2.121,3.7427,1.3198,2.9341,0.8059,1.1836,2.5061,3.5782,1.5883,1.1294,0.6256,0.119,4.2235,5.1501,2.3961,0.7317,5.2521,1.0427,2.0274,5.0146,2.434,0.6631,2.4286,0.6292,1.0798,1.9903,1.2993,2.3247,2.1024,4.858,2.088,2.7794,0.6706,3.9947,3.188,0.1493,1.4838,4.2714,1.8932,2.445,0.3679,5.1036,3.1798,1.5735,0.2435,0.2607,0.0003,3.7763,0.9327,4.6244,3.952,2.4191,3.3954,2.8082,1.8062,5.1657,0.0214,1.766,1.3966,1.7198,2.5654,2.7242,1.3396,0.1084,0.0773,0.898,0.8141,2.2323,0.0082,2.3451,0.2057,3.6031,1.8428,4.2058,1.6572,0.081,5.3946,3.8284,0.7672,0.9491,4.1065,3.7579,0.3588,0.8701,1.3504,6.3116,2.0509,0.0455,0.1495,5.5254,0.0005,4.6197,1.8213,1.056]}

{"id":869,"ended":false,"length":522,"gen_text":"Situated to the right of the main cathedral, the Metropolitan Tabernacle ( Spanish : < unk > Metropolitana ) was built by Lorenzo Rodr\u00edguez during the height of the Baroque period between 1749 and 1757. The altar in the center of the main hall ( the dell) is decorated in bas-relief with a cast of the Virgin Mary.\nAn interesting feature of the Metropolitana is the large marble statue of St Maria Goretti. This impressive statue depicts a young and vigorous mother in a long white dress, holding a baby in her arms. She is wearing a tiara, and is the patroness of the children. The statue was erected in 1751, but only the main chapel and a small part of the choir was completed at the time of the conquest. The complete sculpture was completed in 1754 by Father L\u00e9on, architect and canon of El Riesgo, in the chapel where the sculpture is located, which included the baptismal font, the altar, the lectern and the baptistry.\nThe church was dedicated to Saint Maria Goretti, patroness of the city, during a time when the Portuguese were not in control of the city. In 1801, the Metropolitan installed Maria, grandmother of the Portuguese Prince, in the main hall. From 1803 to 1816 the chapel served as the headquarters of the Order of the Saint (the Order of the Rosary), under the command of Pedro Vaz de Moraes, and at the death of Vaz de Moraes it was sold to the local church. The building as a whole was re-renovated in the 1820's by St Jos\u00e9 Manuel Vaz, under the supervision of his son Jos\u00e9 Manuel, then a Bishop in charge of El Riesgo and in charge of the convent of Saint Maria at the Metropolitana.\nDuring the first two centuries of the Church's existence, the parishioners were mainly Portuguese. At different times the Dominican Order served the churches (during the 18th century it served the Metropolitana, and in the 1810's, the Dominican monastery ), but the community was almost entirely Portuguese settlers; at present it is mainly composed of Spanish and Portuguese individuals.\nThe church is in very good condition. This is due to the work of the original architect Pedro Vaz de Moraes, who carefully preserved the original features of the old church building. He also gave his care and attention to the preservation of the original statue of Saint Mary Goretti, which was moved to the new building in 1816. This statue is kept in the cathedral's choir for this reason.\nSince the church was renovated almost sixty years ago, it is worth mentioning that the statues of the Apostles and the Virgin Mary have been removed from the sanctuary. The statues are placed in the main hall.\nThe Spanish version of this website can be purchased here","token_len":595,"entropy":[4.0701,5.7627,0.2873,3.974,0.0778,0.3357,2.9321,7.1269,0.9081,0.9407,8.1496,6.3376,0.0057,0.0037,3.0322,13.2089,3.5445,9.8534,8.4484,8.1996,7.5502,6.8466,0.1536,0.0309,0.5114,1.595,1.4903,0.9244,2.2684,7.8264,10.1065,0.1426,0.0097,0.001,0.0001,7.2126,0.0877,7.6618,0.0019,0.1501,4.9395,0.0016,0.0031,0.5606,3.0142,2.8058,5.1161,0.1237,0.1167,3.9529,0.3257,1.3837,5.7425,3.5794,0.4172,2.7547,0.5427,0.0406,3.9822,3.3351,3.5299,4.6372,5.3157,3.0041,2.2593,1.011,2.6484,2.639,5.5305,0.1216,0.001,0.0019,1.021,1.5673,5.7981,1.4614,0.7481,1.7217,1.0198,1.8682,2.3571,8.0092,3.6147,1.208,0.3655,0.1924,3.5672,0.1333,0.0419,0.0322,0.2239,0.7458,3.5739,4.3871,2.7421,0.1539,2.2382,6.5574,1.069,0.012,2.104,2.1221,4.7501,1.1694,3.2542,1.6085,1.0978,3.6114,4.4564,4.2654,2.8835,1.424,3.0944,1.2215,0.8772,1.4006,1.4818,0.5447,1.51,0.8589,0.1755,0.1178,0.3023,2.8317,0.7249,2.8658,0.3069,4.1525,0.0,1.4169,1.6423,1.9685,4.7317,0.6494,0.6812,0.0267,1.2133,4.3216,1.2805,1.3824,0.8603,1.1282,3.153,0.5766,1.1616,3.9618,1.567,3.0123,3.2176,2.0588,3.668,4.2213,1.7553,2.1097,0.8468,2.666,0.0295,0.0325,4.5669,2.0462,0.8707,2.5096,0.317,0.715,0.3881,0.6671,4.7505,0.9873,1.2219,5.6506,4.475,0.8502,1.5187,0.4399,0.4393,3.6485,2.8597,5.4748,5.2463,3.5038,0.156,3.7583,6.0617,1.801,5.5613,0.5859,5.3767,4.3265,4.9802,0.0321,1.6391,3.1396,1.1818,3.1769,4.5573,0.5264,5.1794,1.2136,0.8346,3.1291,2.7281,6.5165,0.8193,5.4304,0.2797,0.0509,1.5556,1.106,1.8865,0.6701,0.6051,4.6107,0.0023,1.0957,0.314,3.8494,2.2781,0.2319,1.4281,0.813,3.8091,1.621,3.5514,0.4114,3.0519,0.1752,0.0325,0.0043,2.0261,2.1778,0.0439,0.0289,0.8849,2.5197,1.7008,3.683,2.7381,5.7284,0.6624,0.9049,4.8819,1.1072,3.7331,2.9629,1.6378,0.1348,0.5705,0.5731,0.4368,2.7812,2.6551,3.6665,0.5284,0.8221,4.2084,6.1905,4.661,3.8545,6.1506,0.0771,0.9923,2.7092,4.9913,1.5415,1.5762,0.2713,2.8083,2.1885,1.2029,4.8584,0.9316,2.575,0.6323,0.1247,3.7278,2.3791,4.5268,3.1212,0.1877,0.5784,3.2408,0.2308,0.0914,4.2866,0.0313,1.1997,4.032,5.4363,2.7814,1.6704,0.4339,0.6885,5.1616,0.2131,1.4521,4.6156,0.1944,3.2245,0.0125,5.9642,4.4341,0.4623,1.2065,4.0386,0.0864,0.0891,1.2443,2.9192,4.9518,0.5606,5.5943,0.0237,2.8134,0.0169,0.2026,0.0069,0.0024,0.0007,2.7624,0.3747,4.4459,0.3078,0.4982,5.5164,3.2438,0.9214,1.8174,3.5436,6.8897,0.9869,0.2989,0.4213,4.8596,0.1785,6.1652,0.004,0.002,0.5805,2.1245,2.2984,0.197,1.3652,1.8089,5.7427,5.5633,4.2143,3.8169,0.4357,2.5085,4.9849,0.4067,2.3711,0.0097,2.3953,1.5578,3.533,0.6625,1.8602,4.8369,2.66,4.867,2.6363,1.3779,0.008,2.8602,0.0082,0.013,0.0015,2.9628,4.8167,0.519,0.0125,0.3233,5.8447,1.0697,2.9528,1.1364,6.3607,1.1718,2.7344,0.033,0.0252,0.01,0.1564,1.2217,2.9862,0.1888,3.5107,3.4313,1.0085,0.3093,0.7246,2.5916,0.8827,0.4669,0.4536,0.5108,4.0499,3.0135,0.0207,2.077,2.5819,2.6992,1.7332,4.1297,5.865,0.2938,1.543,5.7361,1.5438,3.2975,0.7933,5.9798,4.4156,3.8629,0.1645,3.2471,0.2082,0.3398,2.0331,3.4083,0.8905,2.5996,0.0259,0.0223,0.013,2.4233,1.4286,1.6643,0.353,3.3162,4.5518,0.1226,2.3541,0.7112,4.9943,4.8549,6.6508,1.4195,1.4244,4.5749,1.1804,4.2303,1.0326,0.5519,7.8564,5.6194,3.8914,3.3307,2.2146,0.4063,3.2837,1.7081,0.0451,2.7868,1.3519,0.3173,6.3309,0.46,0.8918,0.886,1.9434,1.1262,3.2478,3.1881,0.1229,0.1863,1.5873,5.5989,0.8388,0.8966,0.3122,0.249,3.6352,0.3912,0.7849,4.7936,1.1858,5.3227,0.3642,0.0454,0.2946,0.0072,0.0074,0.0004,0.6491,0.9672,5.9051,1.9262,0.4486,0.8508,2.1253,0.461,0.0529,5.5957,0.9873,4.6281,0.702,3.4021,1.3376,4.5174,3.6177,4.6616,2.4449,0.3143,0.0245,0.2828,4.0818,0.1074,0.1972,2.8358,4.8327,0.2462,1.6725,4.2838,3.9988,0.0032,0.9593,0.8199,1.5498,3.5473,0.8923,0.3517,2.9225,3.0555,0.8726,0.7305,2.0045,0.3809,3.762,0.646,1.3069,5.0355,0.3017,0.5834,3.3461,2.6058,2.9643,5.4728,4.7177,0.298,0.2652,0.6739,5.0342,0.9038,3.4156,1.1936,2.8217,6.9582,5.517,0.1603,0.023,0.1593,1.7179,0.8909,5.0687,1.2269,0.6095,0.6417,5.1808,0.5053,0.8815,5.3774,1.5338,0.9717,1.7835,0.4089,1.6592,0.7168,1.4348,1.2843,0.1161,3.3696,1.0533,1.3568,1.8586,1.5808,3.444,0.3903,0.6984,3.2383,0.958,1.9726,1.032,0.8477,5.543,4.7911,0.2992,0.9689,2.1618,2.4366,0.0448,7.9761,1.1232]}

Author Mark Katz explains that `` for the pioneering hip @ - @ hop DJs, noise played a critical role in the way they introduced listeners to the genre.\n\n``The DJs of the 1970's and 1980's were able to make the new-age, underground art form relevant to the public at large, thus opening up the sound to more diverse listeners and increasing its exposure and popularity.\n\n``In the face of the growing backlash from the record industry, the noise-focused DJs began to turn their attention to the new generation of Hip Hop music, which was more accessible and more profitable. While noise remains an incredibly important aspect of music, the influence of noise on the development of new music may have long since passed... \"\n\n``Since its origins in the Bronx during the 1970s, hip hop music has been associated with noise. Author Mark Katz explains that ``... the young, self-described noisy listeners created an atmosphere which fostered a new generation of Hip Hop musicians who took noise's sonic implications to the next level.\n\n``While the origins of noise as a component of the music are obscure, it has served to shape the music as it developed... the sonic parameters of the noise-heavy music, which was so prevalent in the 1980's may well have been determined by what Katz calls the `` Noise Industrial Complex.''\n\n``With respect to Hip Hop music, it has probably served as an ideal vehicle for the sonic expression of the New Generation that emerged in the United States during the late-1980's and 1990's.. \u00a0[It was] a sonic environment steeped in the sonic vocabulary of noise and chaos - in this case, with an array of synthesizers, drum machines, basses, samples, effects, samples of drums and electronic organs. \u00a0In contrast to traditional house styles of the previous generation, the new generation emphasized a mix of sonic elements whose complexity reached the level of experimental music. \u00a0With the rise of noise during the first wave of Hip Hop music, a new, electronic genre was born. \u00a0[W]hile some of the artists that introduced noise to North America during the 1980's were undoubtedly part of the Noise Industrial Complex, it is difficult to identify any singular inventor or creator who is primarily responsible for its birth. \u00a0The explosion of hip hop music over the past three decades can probably be described as a sonic explosion.''\n\nOther authors, such as Mark Brugman note that noise was a part of the genre before it was popularized by hip hop artists. Brugman says that while noise does play an important role in the development of the music, noise itself is more of a part of the music than noise is a part of the listeners.\n\n\nBrugman, Mark\n\n2002\n\nhttp:\/\/www.mikebrugman.com\/","token_len":597,"entropy":[4.719,5.1946,0.9494,0.8967,7.7147,4.4763,0.2208,2.8596,0.078,0.2591,3.7266,2.1635,3.566,0.3863,1.8039,4.0191,0.0516,9.2015,2.5727,10.9846,4.9223,6.7576,2.761,1.1351,10.923,8.9545,1.8399,8.4966,1.786,15.5016,5.5678,7.1798,3.8998,3.2986,0.8772,1.7775,5.4223,0.4246,2.7348,0.1815,0.2955,1.3678,4.0078,0.7342,4.5881,3.033,0.0296,1.46,3.9713,1.0067,4.5551,0.032,3.2243,2.6168,3.5273,3.5086,0.3241,2.2707,2.9388,1.8396,0.7714,0.1114,1.8578,4.2185,0.0132,3.3947,2.2372,3.9972,5.5596,2.2174,3.1171,4.5194,6.161,0.9451,4.8535,0.4805,1.3063,4.2976,3.1645,0.0248,1.9639,5.0752,3.6569,1.3389,1.1142,5.3551,0.7428,3.5016,3.226,1.4267,2.189,3.2783,0.8404,3.2012,3.1997,0.808,0.4851,1.5465,0.0002,0.0541,2.6541,1.184,6.1868,0.0068,1.6607,2.7699,5.7102,2.0444,0.9444,4.0581,0.5712,0.6086,1.2918,3.3367,2.7087,3.6526,1.4162,2.9923,0.5803,3.6831,1.2509,0.6074,0.3542,1.6997,2.9822,3.0705,0.264,6.4123,0.4434,3.3163,1.7087,1.5551,1.3098,3.0682,2.2199,1.1518,3.0924,5.175,0.9527,5.0901,2.5807,4.3741,1.5287,7.5541,0.338,2.2411,0.0526,4.2589,0.7477,1.8257,4.9894,0.2013,0.9825,1.3361,1.7204,2.1755,0.1077,3.2773,1.262,5.5674,1.6612,5.9432,2.2545,1.9476,6.262,5.8993,0.9354,0.0002,4.6491,4.944,1.3298,0.4602,0.0161,0.0064,0.0093,0.0049,0.0019,0.0378,0.0104,0.0226,0.0097,0.0176,0.012,0.0059,0.0019,0.0036,0.0026,0.0028,0.078,0.0237,0.0048,0.0017,0.001,0.0019,0.0073,8.1307,3.7703,6.6463,2.9781,4.709,0.0624,3.0499,5.7635,5.056,5.2193,2.4093,2.5714,3.7232,3.9836,0.0143,1.6735,1.5618,1.1623,0.0435,3.0583,0.0256,3.2683,2.381,4.1553,2.5583,2.3662,3.1887,4.2525,1.8386,2.1575,0.494,0.0437,0.4362,1.4258,0.0002,0.1302,3.6474,1.507,5.6251,0.0306,1.2834,3.1025,0.4118,4.3468,0.0705,3.2986,1.6435,2.0801,4.002,0.1274,1.5236,1.8831,5.1267,1.5636,3.668,0.6644,2.1488,2.8863,1.4676,3.1217,3.3777,4.367,4.776,5.4503,0.4493,1.4995,2.6695,1.8123,4.0538,1.5711,3.2666,2.3257,2.6524,4.6311,2.6352,0.4716,0.2383,2.5968,0.7319,7.0071,2.7202,0.4438,0.9679,4.9233,0.2866,4.2994,5.097,0.6697,0.7062,0.5839,4.1584,5.8207,0.0388,2.617,0.4247,0.0002,0.4272,4.747,5.6075,0.0045,3.2059,0.0243,0.8798,0.1874,2.9899,2.5439,5.2315,2.38,0.764,2.3431,4.9248,1.6481,0.1986,1.2715,3.6482,4.3569,0.0513,1.3508,5.1477,3.8285,4.8193,2.5727,0.6721,0.0923,5.2804,0.0301,1.207,0.059,2.3456,4.2428,0.4439,0.3761,0.834,2.4078,0.0454,5.6686,5.8881,3.593,4.4774,3.2196,2.774,0.2516,1.1839,4.3716,1.6046,6.9141,0.0004,0.0278,1.414,2.3561,4.202,0.2677,1.6417,2.0465,5.4932,4.2694,3.9115,3.933,1.0481,0.4017,5.1143,3.2539,5.1737,0.003,3.4899,0.1617,0.4021,1.9548,0.0527,0.2242,3.0673,1.7011,0.2562,3.9592,0.3443,3.7592,0.4694,3.1502,1.5805,4.6491,1.1466,4.119,5.8916,2.7999,1.4752,0.024,2.6503,4.6573,0.7103,4.2881,5.4095,6.2764,2.0895,1.8304,3.5639,1.5526,0.1744,1.7351,2.4747,1.9563,6.6873,2.4737,4.8486,0.021,4.9117,2.4615,6.3607,4.9374,6.0148,2.2774,2.6528,0.0352,3.5667,1.9972,0.7781,0.6617,0.0114,4.2472,1.3111,3.3932,0.0751,2.4083,5.1715,0.2762,4.7377,3.8006,0.0531,1.8362,0.0134,1.1834,0.292,2.899,0.6617,4.2525,4.8882,4.3192,1.4937,0.2119,1.3292,0.6322,0.0157,3.7626,5.1995,0.0188,2.4326,0.0973,3.798,1.1431,0.364,3.099,3.8473,6.2007,1.5892,1.0937,7.6923,1.4378,2.1834,0.2374,0.9768,0.2412,2.1013,5.1978,4.4424,0.0067,0.6304,1.7858,0.0135,0.0059,0.1558,1.8083,0.6434,2.3853,0.0229,2.768,2.0315,3.4512,5.4171,1.4995,3.1315,3.4053,2.7051,3.8378,0.0416,0.0586,2.7004,3.4639,0.55,0.2796,0.0095,2.141,5.156,0.0978,4.9852,0.0799,0.6558,4.5923,0.0365,0.7142,2.5105,0.0597,2.9573,3.3471,0.1155,4.0318,0.19,0.685,3.7524,0.5182,3.7143,0.1986,0.0003,5.9656,2.8488,2.8273,1.1886,0.0054,3.538,4.6502,4.6124,0.5822,5.5704,0.3725,1.9993,2.1721,1.8554,3.2387,0.0072,1.0117,4.9145,3.7646,1.2994,0.5659,3.4784,0.3259,1.1589,1.7314,0.0494,2.0642,0.6366,2.5615,0.0026,0.0046,3.358,0.9014,3.8706,1.1602,5.2701,2.0406,1.5325,0.1573,0.2211,0.0973,1.0783,1.1576,0.0356,2.0757,1.5937,0.2382,2.4867,3.7917,0.7712,4.7673,1.1979,0.3496,3.3059,0.0599,0.3524,1.6083,0.4838,2.246,1.2883,1.0526,0.2827,0.0052,0.2482,6.2394,0.2421,5.464,0.0009,3.5696,0.1395,0.0038,3.0684,0.3808,5.4432,0.0002,5.9627,1.6589,0.0003,2.6496,0.0005,0.376,0.0109,4.4883,3.8348,0.4187,0.0516,0.0116,0.0201,0.1776,0.1487]}
{"id":2251,"ended":false,"length":565,"gen_text":"At its core, the game is a quiz competition in which the goal is to correctly answer a series of fourteen ( originally fifteen ) consecutive multiple @ - @ choice questions. The final question is one that only the true gamer could answer, and the questions are chosen for their difficulty. In short: the true gamer should never get stuck on a question that's difficult, otherwise he could be stuck until the end!\n\nEach week players draft three of each color (green and white have the most ) and play three games each. Points are awarded for correct answers and penalties for wrong answers.\n\nA note about the game : it's always good to read your opponents before every game. The reason for that is that you can learn a lot about them with a simple read : what questions do you use or are more than usual? For instance: if your opponent plays the deck with, you know that this card will be a problem for you, while your opponent is playing and is generally not a problem for everyone, there's a high chance you will hit.\n\nIf things got out of control, it wouldn't make sense to stop playing. This also means that if you feel confident enough to have a good chance of beating someone, you should be ok to have a very good chance of beating them too.\n\nI'm thinking about making this game available (with an initial print-run) on Fiverr. At the moment there are already two people signed up for the print-run on Fiverr so far. At the same time, that's just to find enough people who want it. What I would like to achieve is to have it as a downloadable.zip (and if necessary,.rar) files available on the web, on our forums, on other sites I should name later at my own discretion. It all depends upon the number of people I am able to sign up and the rate at which I can get them to read the rules so far.\n\nSo here I am. The first time I ever posted a preview image with the text \"This may be my best entry for the past 4 years\". If you want, you can read the preview at www.thespiritbearers.com (which isn't open to the public).\n\nThis page is not intended to promote my personal brand.

There are a variety of reasons for the contract extension for Willis, who is the second-leading tackler on the team with 82 stops this season. His 6.5 sacks are tied with Joe Staley for seventh-most on the team. Willis also ranks second on the team in tackles (95). The new contract ensures that Willis will be with the team in 2013 following the conclusion of his current contract, which runs through the 2013 season...

The veteran defensive end has played in each of his eight seasons with the 49ers in the Niners' Super Bowl title season of 2010. Although Smith has undergone three surgeries -- a partial tear of the MCL in 2007 and a torn meniscus two seasons ago -- he is playing at his All-Pro level this season, per Pro Football Focus. The extension makes Smith the NFL's highest-paid defensive lineman after the Detroit Lions extended Ndamukong Suh at $52 million over six years in May. Smith's overall production has risen each season he has played for the Niners. When healthy, he ranks third in the NFL with 22 sacks and has been a primary pass-rushing force on the Niners' front four...

{"id":3103,"ended":false,"length":546,"gen_text":"Disney Consumer Products created a small line of products to cater to a more adult audience, given the show \u2019 s edgier tone. Paul Gitter, senior VP of Marvel Licensing for Disney Consumer Products noted in a press release that \u2019 the Marvel Comics superhero Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and Hulk all have powerful properties, and we want to keep them that way. \u2019\n\nThis wasn't the first time that Marvel has attempted to incorporate more of its characters into popular and mainstream entertainmen.\n\nIt is a fairly common tactic for corporations to produce comics that take themselves more seriously.\n\nA New York Times article from 2008 discussed the success of Marvel's more serious superheroes.\n\n\"These stories are often more ambitious than stories told by, say, DC Comics, which in comic stories is more about fun than story,\" Mark Waid wrote in the article.\n\nOne such example of this was the Marvel Comics \" Captain Britain,\" who debuted in 2005 and later led the Marvel Universe. As part of his heroic duty, he also has taken on responsibility to protect the British Royal Family from all manner of threats.\n\nMarvel Comics is also well-known for having characters that not only have a more real life presence, but have a more adult-oriented backstory.\n\nTake, for example, the characters of Doctor Strange, who was created back in 1963. Prior to his appearance in the comics, he had been an accomplished magicians, as well as an accomplished military man.\n\nThe comic book version of Strange was created because writer Stan Lee felt as though characters like Wonder Man and the Silver Surfer were more for children-he wanted Strange to be more adult.-\n\nBut after he wrote Strange and was hired aboard the Marvel Studios studio, he decided to add this \"dark\" aspect to the character.\n\n\"The very idea [of drawing] a comic that didn't do anything to appease fans [was a] no-brainer,\" Lee said in the press release. \"I don't want to have it say, 'I'm kids' stuff. I want it to be for adults. What I did was something that had no way of being realistic. It had to be something the readers would want.\"\n\nWhat was that?\n\nWell, there were a lot of adults who had seen The X-Men and Fantastic Four, those franchises whose storylines have now reached a point where they are being taken more seriously.\n\nEven though Marvel now owns many of the characters in those franchises, they decided to introduce a darker, more adult flavor to some of their franchises for this reason.\n\nThe inclusion of Marvel superheroes in Marvel's film releases has also helped broaden their appeal.\n\nSo, when it comes to Marvel's more serious franchises, it should come as no surprise that they would also make comics that appeal to a more adult audience.-\n\nShare On Facebook Tweet Pin It Email","token_len":597,"entropy":[10.4878,0.4333,8.4037,1.1648,5.3746,3.3221,0.0938,3.9337,2.2272,4.9066,0.145,4.1086,3.7764,2.9604,1.2205,1.4537,8.6901,0.969,6.2883,18.3009,9.9933,9.1217,6.5777,5.2778,1.6563,1.4667,0.656,9.1368,3.3581,1.5441,1.198,3.5118,2.8198,0.3971,5.7332,4.717,0.0008,2.9348,1.3623,0.0493,0.0018,5.8746,2.5962,0.8628,1.2692,0.0478,0.651,3.6979,0.0261,2.8921,2.6504,3.7595,4.0372,4.2188,0.0513,2.7002,3.0258,0.013,0.4302,1.2479,0.9823,1.6953,3.1165,1.6172,6.3943,5.1478,2.1304,1.393,2.3794,2.5695,0.3941,4.5513,1.1913,2.8782,0.0001,0.5589,2.3762,0.0064,1.1246,0.0074,4.3539,5.0356,0.062,0.5333,0.293,0.192,1.8547,0.4372,2.2363,2.7047,0.1052,5.4697,1.4677,3.93,1.3809,2.0926,0.2293,4.1336,5.8323,1.2039,6.4408,4.1398,2.2476,3.0926,0.0002,5.2651,3.2548,3.2349,5.0796,1.095,3.1424,1.3432,4.1506,0.2158,4.354,5.7579,1.947,4.52,5.5644,1.5449,0.0668,1.7407,2.4455,0.0002,3.5375,5.7147,0.4524,0.1001,0.4088,0.7995,3.5618,3.7817,1.2368,2.8531,0.1199,1.6659,0.5261,4.9861,0.55,5.4947,1.6175,0.7547,0.0002,1.9811,4.8662,3.794,1.0994,3.5466,2.1139,5.1385,1.5042,5.99,3.4419,0.5689,4.7949,0.0657,0.0069,2.2369,0.3344,0.5945,1.255,4.2909,6.7984,5.6615,3.1962,3.5048,2.3537,2.9098,1.9717,4.7017,1.0693,5.4547,1.6327,0.0002,2.669,1.0489,1.2338,1.1916,0.1932,0.7634,0.0002,4.9336,2.6925,0.9244,1.2637,1.3816,1.3122,1.0543,2.667,1.7001,3.5846,8.3337,4.6484,3.6977,2.4134,6.1736,0.1367,4.0524,1.8223,5.43,5.3157,1.5665,2.1538,1.2952,2.2355,5.2674,3.3643,0.0026,1.893,4.3857,4.6492,0.2829,1.3729,4.6529,4.5704,5.5584,0.9177,5.5964,1.4382,2.0637,0.6428,2.0656,4.583,0.1136,2.0,4.056,1.6753,0.0059,1.1207,0.3693,0.3043,0.0002,2.6342,2.3942,3.6547,1.5614,3.4673,1.8427,0.0339,0.0321,3.9757,3.1275,1.261,6.0325,0.1153,1.7943,1.8234,1.6337,6.5263,3.279,3.7732,0.6189,0.0821,2.5149,1.5653,1.0609,3.1352,3.259,0.5211,5.2045,0.4357,0.5653,0.0002,3.5505,1.4761,0.0147,0.2953,0.0221,0.8954,4.4105,0.9583,3.6285,0.8497,0.9252,1.9705,1.5032,1.1676,4.9818,0.0314,0.7537,1.1143,4.5318,0.0037,1.0575,3.0111,0.7533,0.7892,2.0843,0.0955,1.048,1.9352,1.4915,2.4205,3.432,6.0616,1.6594,1.398,4.0041,0.4776,0.0346,2.1867,2.1936,4.7868,1.9086,0.4006,0.6992,0.0002,2.628,3.0653,1.1627,1.2459,0.1785,1.5846,1.3792,2.2839,4.7464,3.7757,0.1624,0.0015,2.6166,4.9273,0.6101,5.4133,0.6758,4.2814,1.2168,0.8075,2.014,2.2747,0.0048,0.0,0.8869,3.4524,3.7374,0.8249,7.6235,4.7868,1.5149,5.5135,0.1756,0.4034,1.1899,1.702,7.8729,1.911,0.0002,4.6623,4.9847,3.079,4.8607,1.751,3.0836,3.8582,4.8128,9.5154,1.2614,1.6427,0.8343,5.9405,0.3998,0.8583,2.8903,0.6657,3.7633,5.2075,4.128,2.8443,1.9796,2.4527,0.2925,0.561,0.0871,0.505,0.36,0.0002,1.8624,2.641,5.9409,2.9508,5.4644,0.1544,6.4059,2.6295,1.6526,3.6209,3.4762,5.3221,0.0038,5.2531,1.0074,2.4662,5.2113,5.7465,4.6974,1.0749,2.7393,0.8525,3.3975,0.0409,0.258,0.5878,0.8065,1.0123,0.9625,2.4568,3.8047,0.0468,0.2679,1.2064,1.6838,3.6621,0.0019,1.9632,0.4211,3.9044,4.7352,3.8552,0.6425,0.098,3.5919,0.5798,6.3837,0.7966,0.4593,1.531,0.426,0.3461,1.0399,0.0326,0.7762,5.0427,0.8913,1.6326,4.9195,1.6031,2.8828,0.7141,5.8837,1.093,3.6412,3.3685,5.565,0.6786,0.8391,5.6475,1.4093,1.8549,1.8084,0.765,0.2289,2.6409,4.4082,2.7189,0.8661,3.0509,2.3483,0.1788,0.0002,5.0817,3.512,4.5916,1.4085,0.9641,0.0001,1.7637,0.0869,3.7461,2.0833,2.1278,1.4414,0.0199,3.9343,0.9699,4.0086,3.4,3.6177,3.5481,0.01,0.2496,1.6458,3.2524,0.0048,2.0302,6.922,4.3681,5.0833,3.2957,3.3561,5.4705,3.9307,1.8246,2.3273,0.4056,0.6916,0.968,4.2003,3.7288,1.4085,0.0793,1.1336,0.4138,0.0002,5.8047,1.784,1.6502,5.5624,3.2577,5.113,0.1664,0.9366,1.3798,2.127,1.3419,0.2742,0.1219,1.2997,5.7977,0.4218,4.3559,1.0753,2.0789,1.9701,0.6453,0.7026,4.9607,0.2586,3.5998,0.0511,1.0473,5.3618,5.1165,4.6563,1.5458,0.2042,0.1506,0.0002,2.6208,6.0868,0.0078,3.2398,2.9408,0.7846,5.3382,1.906,3.7591,4.5826,1.3587,1.1037,2.4298,3.7939,1.2715,0.5882,0.8026,0.3737,0.0002,5.3394,1.3065,3.3446,2.4075,0.2076,0.0821,1.4437,1.128,3.1745,1.5385,4.369,0.1865,1.7973,4.4914,0.6215,0.0113,0.0486,0.0317,0.0871,1.5156,2.5508,1.7398,3.8765,4.5609,0.7561,3.3049,0.1684,1.3383,0.3542,0.2226,0.1648,6.4288,0.1076,0.0002,4.4928,0.0893,0.0032,0.0004,0.0001,0.0002,0.0]}
{"id":1494,"ended":true,"length":563,"gen_text":"In 1981, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry set aside $ 850 million for the Fifth generation computer project. Their objectives were to write programs and build machines that could carry out military and commercial tasks in the year 2000.\nIt was the age of technology wars because of the emergence of the personal computer. Its main components were the Intel-compatible processor and the disk drive. When the first IBM PC was released in June 1981, it was called the world's first personal computer. This company is well-known for computer and computer programming. IBM became a household name with their computers.\nJapan was not alone in being eager to play with the new computer. The Korean and the US also have their own computers but for the most part, the Asian countries did not invest in designing new computers for use abroad because of the high cost of manufacturing. Japan however, did not have such problems nor was it shy about investing in the new technology. They had the largest computer company and the most advanced computer engineering team, so there was no reason not to participate in the emerging technology war.\nThe Fifth generation computer project was originally conceived in 1982 by Tsuruichi Yamazaki of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The project had 3 main objectives. Firstly, to produce a small machine that could operate on a common circuit board, instead of using different circuits. The chip was already in the works and so there was no reason for Japan to put their resources into the production of this new machine. Second, to make chips that could operate at extremely low temperatures. Third, to provide the user with improved features such as a mouse and an advanced interface like a graphical-type keyboard.\u00a0 Thirdly, to make it possible to program, and lastly the machine had to be easy to operate, as well as easy to program.\nThere was a little known fact at the time which was that Japan had a highly advanced computer engineering team. They had developed a chip for the processor of the Intel-compatible computer (the 8086), the chip that was adopted by the new Atari games console when it was introduced in 1982, by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The chip was used widely, because of the ability to make chips for IBM and the IBM PC.\nThe original project was to have two chips, one for the original microcomputer and the other for the computer interface. When this computer was announced several years later, it had a similar form factor to a standard IBM-PC, using the Intel-compatible processor.\nSixty year later, we still live with these older generation, microcomputer.

{"id":4736,"ended":false,"length":560,"gen_text":"The championship resumed three weeks later in China, with the lead @ - @ in period to the race marked by Lotus F1 protesting the legality of Mercedes's rear wing design. The FIA's World Motor Sport Council ordered Mercedes not to use the wing until the investigation had concluded.\n\nWith the second stint of the race still to follow, the teams' technical chiefs - a group of 14 top engineers from across teams - convened in Geneva to examine data from all three days and determine the most acceptable solution for the remainder of the season. According to Ecclestone, the solution had already been discussed in private between himself and Lewis Hamilton, but with the FIA's ruling still up in the air, he refused to comment on whether it was safe to use.\n\nHamilton's decision to continue his stint is widely seen by many as being a direct result of Ecclestone's pressure. His victory was won with little less than three minutes left but, during the stewards' meeting, Hamilton appeared to be under the impression that there would be a fine and the possibility of a second penalty for his illegal entry. This only added to Hamilton's desire to make a statement of protest and when the stewards declared the situation to be resolved, Hamilton began to run the red flag.\n\nThe teams had hoped to use the new regulations to give the drivers some clarity: they wanted the qualifying lap to count only for the car's speed during qualifying and their lap-time in the race, and for the cars to start the race from the same grid slot as in qualifying. They could then then choose whichever driver they thought was going to finish on top. But for obvious reasons, such a system would mean the front runners would have to give up their best strategy by taking the early grid spots. So, instead of this, Mercedes chose to introduce the rear wing, which meant their cars finished first in both qualifying sessions and then on the grid, where Lewis had been set to take pole position.\n\nIt was the latest in a history of scandals during the weekend. There had been the 'Red Bullgate' incident, which saw an angry Vettel slam his helmet into Hamilton's face at the start of the race when the World Champion appeared to get too close to the Ferrari's racing line; and the 'Saubergate' incident, which had seen Ecclestone appear to offer up the suggestion of an independent F1 race for next season if his preferred teams, Mercedes and Ferrari, did not enter the sport. The controversy surrounding the first race had been followed by the 'Monaco, Monaco, Monaco' flap, where Force India had made the decision that they would not have either drivers run under green flag on Sunday after the Silverstone dust-up involving Jenson Button. Meanwhile, the drivers had to endure numerous'scuffles' in the race, which led to many of them being penalised at the end of lap two for not following the rules.\n\nRace results","token_len":598,"entropy":[10.4073,9.7243,6.3991,1.4797,0.2677,2.0334,6.9488,0.8385,1.8757,1.5818,6.9194,14.6552,7.8723,8.7029,4.8955,11.4306,6.9025,2.5948,6.4528,9.0963,1.0298,9.5107,4.4305,0.0021,11.327,1.5228,6.2305,0.022,5.8297,3.6559,4.6057,0.3874,4.6564,0.7293,1.6394,2.3271,2.9131,3.8802,0.5143,0.0064,0.0006,4.1625,1.1952,4.4658,0.015,0.7738,0.6398,2.1348,2.4107,0.7902,5.0317,2.175,1.6974,0.5506,0.9538,0.0035,4.3042,1.0602,5.5961,5.1106,1.7413,0.2604,0.8285,3.8049,1.1579,5.7765,0.1621,1.2467,3.2799,4.0792,3.192,1.7009,5.3454,5.1984,2.012,1.5023,4.5552,5.075,1.9616,1.9944,3.6042,5.245,0.3788,2.9584,1.2199,2.6352,0.7803,4.5099,4.3176,0.9634,3.2135,1.7843,3.3073,2.9811,3.6208,1.3045,3.2538,6.5885,1.3964,1.6596,0.4089,1.8927,0.0085,0.0297,0.8347,0.0629,6.9563,0.0044,4.9465,0.0003,0.0002,0.1413,1.0386,3.2613,3.2282,1.6901,0.0149,4.584,2.239,2.2384,2.1184,4.0363,0.3835,3.5605,0.0068,1.4746,1.7516,5.3998,0.8079,2.1219,1.4672,2.9984,2.4196,4.4445,0.0573,0.0022,0.0002,0.2948,2.3472,4.5307,0.0284,2.9976,1.1776,2.7692,1.6589,1.093,5.4628,1.1206,1.2754,0.7559,0.2501,0.0004,3.2265,2.1432,3.5536,0.3597,3.4355,3.8631,3.6657,5.3543,2.9862,2.3664,4.0997,2.438,0.2491,3.189,1.8467,3.1842,0.7519,0.0076,1.6047,0.0002,0.0008,0.1155,4.6892,1.0093,4.1792,5.1018,2.4827,5.1897,2.1226,5.0595,4.6696,0.0457,2.4994,1.0725,2.5494,5.8451,2.4897,5.8479,0.5257,3.8464,0.1746,2.3374,0.3727,1.3892,5.3533,0.347,2.1363,3.4668,1.1309,0.1439,0.2354,4.0,1.6115,0.1543,1.6581,5.2411,2.854,3.4653,3.9852,0.0258,0.9382,5.0707,1.7017,1.2191,2.1508,5.0952,4.9366,0.728,3.9089,5.4081,2.368,0.2256,2.4438,0.0054,2.9225,0.078,3.9125,2.1017,1.1465,3.3285,3.0209,2.6157,5.7192,1.014,0.6566,5.2544,1.1247,4.9227,2.2154,0.0562,4.3692,0.385,0.6227,5.3716,0.9789,4.3676,2.0265,2.7824,0.2922,1.0259,0.4231,0.0004,2.0743,4.8359,2.4434,4.1295,1.2313,3.0838,0.5035,4.5185,3.2104,0.3864,3.921,2.2636,1.0392,4.456,6.0629,6.1319,2.6663,2.1147,2.1066,5.0003,4.5053,0.2601,3.2528,3.7357,1.5735,1.0641,4.2274,0.4206,3.1414,2.8797,3.1863,1.5841,5.5485,3.8973,3.2723,0.6089,1.9656,0.3766,0.0666,2.3775,2.2572,2.7054,0.697,3.8116,0.2047,3.2925,2.2193,0.0415,1.8322,0.6674,1.7387,0.813,3.1754,1.4936,2.6452,0.7766,0.2221,3.4523,4.5393,2.2439,5.6478,3.4096,4.3617,3.8133,0.6988,3.1773,1.5313,4.0582,0.1462,2.2814,1.436,2.3462,1.1422,2.9396,5.1099,5.445,0.1925,0.3937,3.9084,0.5277,0.7264,0.9336,3.3977,1.9401,5.5357,1.7219,0.4031,1.8137,0.6457,5.376,0.3267,1.5152,4.0101,4.4332,5.6527,3.5523,1.4628,4.2227,2.1768,2.8378,1.2726,4.2778,1.7511,3.0656,1.3041,4.129,1.9659,4.4686,3.086,0.1819,3.7267,1.8385,6.1103,0.0964,2.2278,0.8629,4.0348,4.433,2.3859,5.4547,4.3768,2.4657,1.8353,2.2174,1.8947,1.1911,3.0461,3.1469,0.5689,0.6047,1.966,3.7317,3.7186,3.309,2.157,4.3701,0.3002,2.6385,1.2901,0.6722,0.3689,0.3068,0.0004,3.4783,0.8928,2.6794,5.3426,0.9,0.0476,7.1031,0.0966,4.6354,5.2682,0.4938,5.405,1.1146,4.1643,0.8508,0.1291,1.8813,4.4335,5.4923,0.3048,2.1615,0.1095,0.9525,1.2119,2.3941,0.6721,4.2849,2.2156,4.1239,0.0051,3.2878,1.0897,0.4519,1.2931,3.631,0.0776,1.8114,2.5047,0.7256,1.2452,0.262,0.3359,0.6878,3.5907,0.5934,6.0618,0.048,3.1322,0.0717,4.4734,1.5015,0.0488,0.1603,0.7267,1.3304,1.8434,5.8118,2.8304,3.674,1.6939,0.9836,1.2817,3.778,1.1667,8.0319,12.0158,0.0597,0.332,0.2168,1.3522,3.8188,1.0374,5.4747,0.0002,0.0005,5.3287,0.1381,6.5151,5.2309,2.0234,3.1286,1.3344,2.8277,4.8536,4.9157,0.0137,2.0162,3.3147,4.1398,1.1153,3.6105,5.2637,3.046,2.427,3.0836,3.1597,0.056,0.3791,0.0373,2.0661,0.0299,4.9743,1.9858,0.1484,0.6944,3.043,4.1915,2.2246,0.8172,5.4604,2.002,2.5459,1.8763,4.2015,0.3066,1.4566,2.2775,3.559,0.227,6.0834,1.2712,1.61,0.0148,0.1089,5.3935,0.4405,2.1758,5.5272,0.001,2.9219,4.3193,2.2902,1.9328,4.4539,1.3029,0.3966,1.0735,3.9753,6.44,3.4695,6.0252,4.0444,4.1468,1.1538,4.4389,3.1252,3.3953,1.618,5.7523,0.2501,6.8834,0.7437,0.0154,4.4169,3.5656,0.435,0.0008,1.1949,5.9541,0.0995,1.5216,4.3572,0.9957,3.4394,2.2571,5.7218,10.6392,8.5475,3.9354,3.3416,8.4301,2.4912,0.5176,2.1813,1.101,2.9209,4.0609,0.1436,3.3173,2.1599,0.2416,2.1525,3.1253,0.0868,3.9411,0.4601,1.6399,0.2403,5.4398,2.6268,1.818,3.2498,2.9171,0.4877,2.2863,0.746,0.5131,0.0004,5.3529,1.8262]}

Richard Curtis will not be acting in the show\n\nThe pilot is intended to make up for the fact that BBC1 has not been broadcasting Doctor Who since 2005, a period of almost 10 years since the show first returned to screens.\n\nDoctor Who is coming back to the BBC.\n\nIt is being commissioned by BBC Worldwide where it will be shown on BBC1, BBC2 and e.\n\nIt will be presented with the use of visual effects by director of photography John Ottoway and production designer Peter Bennett, with music by Toby Haynes. A cast of new and returning actors will also be on hand.\n\nCurtis, who has written and acted in Doctor Who specials since the start of its recent regeneration, said the show's new format is exciting and will be unlike anything he has written.\n\n\"What I'm really proud of about Doctor Who is the ability it has to make you feel both very small and also very big. It will be so big on a set, like the one shot you see towards the end (of this preview) but also so small, such as the conversation in the lift with the crew (taken at the start of the regeneration sequences in 'The Five Doctors'), \" said the actor, who is no stranger to Doctor Who himself.\n\n\"We got two days to script. The pilot is about how the regeneration process happens and will involve the Doctor and companion. It involves a journey that you're going to get from beginning to end, and I can't tell you what will happen. When I read the script I felt very excited at the prospect of watching it all in one go.\n\n\"It didn't sound like the Doctor's usual fare but that's what I like about him; there's not a stereotype about him. He's not just a boy scout. He can also be very brave and thoughtful.\n\n\"The first thing he thinks about is saving a life, which I think will be one of the elements of the story that you'll recognise.\"\n\nThe show will be directed by Ken Bentley, known for his work on classic comedy series The Young Ones. He has described the project as \"a real adventure and adventure that has a real heart.\"\n\nDoctor Who writer Steven Moffat said: \"I want to make this the best Doctor Who that anyone, anywhere, has ever watched. It will not be a second-rate show - it will be the best one yet.\n\n\"It will be about more than what we see on TV. It will show a different side of this character.\"\n\nThe new series is also going to feature three new monsters, with the first one \"the most terrifying thing I have ever seen\", he added.","token_len":598,"entropy":[7.825,5.605,4.0221,6.6993,5.3726,0.1896,1.1412,1.0576,6.7078,0.0798,8.9085,1.8768,3.7207,0.1482,0.7384,0.0018,1.1847,3.6631,3.7719,16.4634,7.2899,8.1395,7.303,3.9255,4.0494,4.5467,3.7461,5.8506,0.0434,4.1251,7.418,4.042,13.5628,2.4094,0.015,0.4329,2.063,3.6848,0.0757,0.5905,3.8357,0.9491,2.9209,4.9708,0.3676,6.3333,0.3899,1.1272,2.2468,5.3559,0.0171,1.9404,5.8218,2.189,6.517,0.3233,5.0229,3.0932,0.3189,0.7817,1.9942,0.1651,3.5039,1.4578,2.1332,1.3615,1.9518,2.3183,0.8148,0.0015,0.6875,1.2662,1.4041,4.1379,2.4675,2.1074,2.5914,3.2742,0.0341,2.4883,0.4886,1.4324,2.4514,2.2753,0.3438,2.7535,0.6372,0.343,0.0002,3.4018,0.0067,2.4646,4.9158,0.2825,0.5913,2.2061,0.4558,4.6298,3.0989,0.0002,3.5251,1.4923,2.6251,2.8249,0.5493,0.6663,2.6787,5.8484,1.0907,0.3842,0.607,1.2684,1.5309,1.1956,1.2252,1.5127,0.3867,0.142,0.6913,6.3266,1.3698,2.2265,0.0002,2.6622,0.923,0.6702,4.0824,3.648,1.4564,6.0272,0.0045,5.5659,0.058,2.1993,5.0719,2.5345,0.5371,3.4346,4.3708,2.7217,1.4904,2.1562,0.0724,3.7863,3.7035,1.8855,2.3421,3.3309,0.6604,5.443,2.7108,0.0104,0.6179,7.115,3.1975,1.0608,3.5484,0.3636,0.4875,1.4848,0.918,0.7957,0.6319,3.9664,1.4552,0.8095,0.0792,0.0002,4.8849,0.8329,0.0202,1.7233,0.3942,1.7145,1.7624,2.0807,2.7715,0.2726,2.8099,0.0006,2.0918,2.4825,1.3849,5.7137,0.157,3.4041,5.8872,3.7195,1.2526,1.4947,2.619,1.4401,2.2632,2.4959,1.5861,4.2205,5.5857,2.1767,2.2608,1.9421,4.1958,0.1663,0.8734,0.2573,2.6596,1.3447,0.0764,0.0002,1.0994,4.436,1.4189,1.9429,1.6651,3.369,0.0845,3.4545,2.4305,0.0028,0.3101,1.7423,4.9284,2.0174,0.1671,0.296,3.9374,1.7488,1.1583,4.3006,3.4749,2.2555,0.1374,6.1097,0.3225,0.4469,2.3905,1.2083,4.3481,1.0541,4.6398,3.2335,3.712,3.6699,5.1627,2.1986,4.662,1.8006,2.8448,6.0198,3.363,0.5352,6.5997,0.003,0.1243,5.5033,0.6039,2.3574,4.5038,0.8845,2.5271,1.7966,1.3531,0.3911,2.3125,5.352,0.1843,0.7873,5.0297,2.6057,0.3843,5.0042,1.6436,0.939,4.9234,4.8398,5.8743,0.7205,3.4511,0.715,1.7963,0.0614,0.5655,6.1385,5.7485,2.2741,2.379,0.7395,4.2179,0.0131,1.9583,4.8914,1.9696,4.0854,3.1051,2.1699,0.3152,1.7911,4.5434,0.1877,0.0037,1.7695,0.0013,2.9388,1.0978,0.1254,0.0003,0.3051,3.3855,5.9957,5.9401,2.8084,1.0506,5.313,4.3489,2.4016,4.299,1.1066,2.9452,3.4336,1.4663,3.4251,1.768,2.7131,1.39,5.4535,3.8507,1.8159,1.1304,1.8329,3.9025,2.6993,1.4136,4.8989,1.5538,5.4359,2.4119,3.7131,3.5104,2.0673,0.1573,2.5111,4.0869,3.2394,0.0216,0.0454,1.9369,1.8854,2.5666,3.1453,0.1826,3.3152,0.0195,1.9363,3.0823,0.0662,2.082,5.856,1.3885,2.6358,0.697,0.4206,0.7986,3.3071,2.5841,1.3045,4.909,0.2965,0.8997,0.3053,5.2702,0.9342,3.8941,4.0819,1.8184,0.2427,0.9591,1.1532,0.0003,0.0694,1.6262,7.3854,0.0003,5.6775,0.5557,2.4993,2.8441,2.9023,4.0621,4.4789,1.8797,2.9824,0.4471,1.7369,1.2533,2.192,0.3278,2.6553,4.001,4.1491,0.6884,3.6756,0.9697,5.6761,1.2519,0.2445,0.7529,1.0781,0.4782,2.1648,3.3461,0.7809,4.5488,2.7471,1.5377,0.6368,3.8628,3.1011,0.4304,2.0582,4.3912,0.8301,4.8704,1.088,1.8048,0.0003,0.0573,1.9952,3.7906,1.8136,3.2285,4.539,1.1151,1.006,5.1252,2.8227,1.8141,1.4679,1.9652,2.9116,0.7628,3.067,0.468,4.3632,0.0573,0.1678,5.7824,0.7991,0.2752,1.8689,2.1691,2.9119,1.3723,3.8981,2.1414,0.0433,0.0002,1.7043,2.3381,1.1581,0.7928,2.635,0.0692,4.7358,0.0115,0.6234,4.234,0.17,0.503,0.1993,0.1094,5.5031,3.9827,1.3904,1.3862,2.5002,0.0099,1.5138,2.7084,2.3197,4.9094,0.7328,3.4369,0.053,0.6422,1.3585,3.6866,3.1328,3.541,1.5057,3.2514,3.2571,1.2056,2.2757,1.7495,2.5456,0.0723,0.0002,2.1959,0.0018,4.2933,1.8511,0.0005,0.0124,1.335,0.8067,0.0151,1.4023,4.411,0.4939,1.7089,2.7558,2.6195,1.2113,0.6782,0.023,3.0852,3.3277,6.2104,0.1578,1.0722,0.8034,0.1356,4.0213,0.5886,2.2531,1.7344,3.7526,0.6199,1.7724,5.6636,1.2607,0.5487,2.3349,3.267,0.8162,0.251,0.2654,1.3937,0.2455,4.8418,2.7881,0.9232,0.7851,0.0002,0.0437,1.7024,1.0013,0.6103,3.5976,5.3239,0.078,4.0247,2.3904,2.7029,0.7494,2.086,1.3132,0.5446,0.1949,4.3152,2.8211,3.0669,0.1195,0.2048,3.2719,3.1314,3.1146,0.0849,0.0002,1.6125,2.5004,0.5862,2.3399,3.8544,4.3066,0.06,2.3278,5.7323,1.6891,2.1124,1.03,2.9777,1.2382,1.7305,1.8982,5.6412,2.9887,1.6828,1.8807,1.2956,1.2491,1.5179,0.1818,1.0601,2.2097,2.995,0.9178,0.0289]}
{"id":2928,"ended":false,"length":539,"gen_text":"According to Mendelian inheritance, variations in an organism's phenotype ( observable physical and behavioral characteristics ) are due in part to variations in its genotype ( particular set of genes ). Each mutation's effect on an organism's phenotypic traits can differ greatly, depending on which of its genes has been altered.\n\nThe genetic basis for behavioral variation in humans is not fully known, and research using genome-wide data is ongoing. One approach to understanding the genetic basis of human behavior is to see whether there are genetic mechanisms that might underlie specific characteristics. This approach has been applied to the study of human sexuality, since we know that some behaviors (e.g. homosexuality \/ sexual orientation; bisexuality \/ bisexuality ) are caused by multiple genes with different effects. This approach has been followed to a larger extent than to any other behavior. One example of a particular group of genes that have been implicated in behavior is the serotonin pathway, which is the largest gene family and is generally believed to underlie both mental and physical behavior.\n\nFor example, studies have found that some of the sex-linked genes in the serotonin pathway appear to be linked to higher rates of homosexuality, for example, some variants of the MAOA gene. These variations in MAOA have been shown to be linked to increased rates of homosexuality through the action of estrogen receptor, which is found on the surface of cells that make cells that secrete estrogen.\n\nSimilarly, the serotonin 3A:5D receptor gene has been connected to homosexuality. It exists in two versions, one that is present in many males ( ) that carries the common misspelling of the name, and a second that lacks the misspelling ( ). A variant of the gene that causes the latter version is generally regarded as linked to homosexuality in women, but with an important difference: a man with the original misspelling would be female, but a man with the correct spelling would be male.\n\nAnother common variant of the MAOA gene is found in over 35% of the men in Norway ( ). The SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) located in genepub 1, which is located over 17,250 base pairs (bp) downstream from MAOA locus on chromosome 16, codes for a 634-bp fragment that encodes a part of the gene. This genepub SNP is called the 5382T polymorphism, and its effect on the functioning of a gene has now been linked to male sexual orientation in many different studies using different sample populations.\n\nHuman sexuality is not quite as simple as \"nature\" vs. \"nurture\" theory. Sexual orientation varies by culture, upbringing and gender identity. As noted, these are complex phenomena, involving many interacting genetic, neurobiological and personality traits. We should all understand these processes better when we understand the genetic basis of complex human behaviors, and it is critical to the development of treatments for these diseases.\n\nFurther reading","token_len":598,"entropy":[0.0086,9.7951,2.229,5.8412,2.0896,1.4458,7.9389,0.2119,3.1605,0.9059,0.0569,3.0497,2.0516,11.3192,2.7112,3.6555,0.6437,1.0237,1.3949,0.8366,1.9442,4.0865,0.4635,0.0121,2.2151,0.0274,1.1888,0.6414,0.0494,0.221,7.5259,2.475,0.0076,0.8829,1.7462,5.1754,5.5047,7.6791,0.7807,0.5182,1.1811,0.2113,0.3241,3.8468,0.3759,0.01,1.0651,2.1271,5.4882,2.9442,2.1557,1.0581,0.097,2.0015,2.1178,2.4988,0.6216,3.5094,0.2917,1.8621,0.469,1.5514,0.0387,2.4401,3.8547,1.8936,1.3616,5.9875,0.7343,2.7968,0.8409,0.8038,2.3718,1.9873,3.0757,1.214,2.7004,4.1796,5.3006,4.4302,0.1195,0.0254,2.7561,1.7324,2.4067,0.1623,3.641,3.9282,1.0153,1.5632,1.1392,0.9124,0.1024,0.4828,1.3198,1.2336,0.4635,0.4054,6.1608,2.0319,2.5224,0.4472,1.7136,5.9063,0.6786,3.2199,2.0032,0.0022,2.9448,4.7194,2.146,3.1231,1.192,1.3558,0.8178,1.6337,0.177,1.8919,1.1212,0.0046,2.3954,5.1752,1.1842,4.9437,5.7393,0.3985,0.199,3.0863,2.3595,2.9112,0.7056,0.0018,0.0016,2.0515,1.9307,7.6006,4.8078,0.3725,5.014,2.8488,0.0734,1.487,1.1114,0.0802,2.3903,0.3931,3.1994,0.1049,5.0915,0.3797,4.5712,1.2123,0.8302,0.6565,3.5763,1.0021,0.912,1.0347,6.3994,1.6483,1.9949,5.5484,0.1745,2.4779,1.7028,3.1719,0.067,2.6496,1.2846,3.8778,2.2954,0.6248,1.2917,5.2339,5.6705,0.0346,0.4399,0.8514,1.7284,0.0843,2.112,0.1737,2.699,0.4008,0.3816,1.2765,5.3638,1.4095,0.6101,1.0395,4.0183,5.3211,1.8704,1.5503,3.8207,1.7176,5.2761,2.3228,0.0113,2.2647,0.0063,3.947,4.4035,0.4057,0.2833,2.8303,0.3907,0.9183,0.0002,4.6042,1.5172,0.0267,3.5539,1.4574,1.8903,0.4608,3.281,2.9902,0.1018,5.1693,1.8859,1.8662,0.5062,2.5334,0.4093,0.226,0.1812,4.0223,0.0522,0.7981,2.7919,0.2157,5.544,1.8921,0.0051,1.3933,1.858,5.1595,0.1405,0.668,4.3078,3.4917,0.279,0.2731,2.7785,0.4479,0.0995,2.7219,3.7036,3.2042,1.0106,1.7979,0.0127,2.0626,0.3788,1.8876,0.0408,1.3926,1.6108,0.1381,2.3962,1.7177,0.007,0.817,4.2965,2.7279,4.1482,0.0138,4.1618,5.1075,3.9217,1.1511,0.8781,3.4256,1.0406,0.5562,0.616,0.0103,1.9186,2.1173,1.4516,5.6253,1.4274,3.4157,0.0003,1.7662,0.6549,1.6028,0.0002,4.934,0.0172,2.6429,2.1273,5.0912,0.9908,5.3541,0.6377,1.2956,1.7485,0.544,1.3992,0.1609,6.1814,0.1751,3.5622,1.7346,3.1393,6.9474,0.6344,1.9229,1.6617,0.662,1.0203,2.221,0.8156,5.0964,0.3352,4.5294,2.1785,2.6827,6.0311,4.7049,5.74,0.9326,4.2945,3.8072,1.9162,0.9985,0.9927,2.6153,1.3654,0.3172,2.3378,1.3396,2.1493,5.6267,0.4319,1.0823,0.0356,1.135,0.5773,3.7311,2.2619,0.3494,0.8125,0.7545,1.2059,3.3959,1.2237,2.5461,1.4933,1.4715,5.4979,4.611,0.1355,4.6564,0.0794,1.1439,2.8055,3.1048,1.1628,1.5737,5.3152,4.0518,3.8022,1.0652,1.1668,3.5479,3.2422,1.2796,0.7845,5.1797,2.9294,0.0565,3.6944,1.7878,3.6968,0.7265,1.6116,0.7313,0.286,0.0905,0.066,4.092,2.1168,0.3225,0.0856,0.0729,0.1249,1.0374,0.0002,2.8815,4.9685,1.3702,0.3825,0.2832,1.6036,0.0157,0.0227,1.0465,2.4823,0.2433,5.0243,5.3114,0.2057,0.0087,2.4098,2.8771,1.672,4.9944,2.6257,1.2982,2.0713,5.7688,2.4612,3.1111,0.026,0.0105,0.0003,0.044,0.001,0.0172,0.087,2.8438,1.253,7.3912,5.5089,5.8593,4.3778,1.5884,1.9777,0.9393,1.8785,6.1283,5.2291,2.2569,6.7735,1.9223,0.0093,1.59,0.167,0.1508,3.6834,1.3839,3.015,0.0267,4.4736,0.0422,2.9036,0.2753,2.8456,0.4556,5.5732,0.0042,0.6916,5.2507,4.1059,1.3059,0.5381,2.4536,2.2337,1.8367,0.0,0.9008,5.6274,0.0307,0.4713,4.4863,1.3722,1.464,6.4254,0.6049,0.0005,0.7817,0.9236,3.3101,1.5734,2.6561,5.19,2.6771,1.5769,0.0076,1.2203,0.5263,3.074,2.3401,0.537,1.3019,4.4564,0.0196,4.7607,1.5637,1.9366,6.3592,0.0185,3.3729,0.1026,4.5909,3.1974,0.0195,1.2752,3.7102,3.2728,0.4788,4.7043,0.6963,5.1255,1.4506,0.4341,0.7477,0.0002,6.3029,2.1422,1.0373,2.7845,6.0651,1.1092,0.7717,0.0643,4.2547,4.7812,2.2272,1.1036,0.2026,0.0278,0.007,0.0003,0.0011,1.4233,4.933,1.3681,4.4845,0.641,4.4267,3.8842,2.1531,0.8448,5.3704,1.9481,3.9337,1.6104,0.7573,4.1734,3.4213,2.119,4.0972,1.9019,2.1286,2.6511,1.2124,4.2829,1.7401,3.2607,2.2251,1.1317,3.8476,1.3772,0.0189,0.5502,7.3096,4.5758,0.2696,4.2818,4.168,4.9989,5.001,3.3877,4.7554,0.577,3.1581,0.7385,1.5167,0.9012,1.3947,0.396,0.3562,5.5675,1.2569,0.8153,2.0824,1.5061,3.6253,0.4575,4.0456,0.8752,3.3286,2.9693,0.0364,3.5158,0.7195,2.1192,3.2722,0.4372,0.7066,0.0002,4.1363,1.1867]}
{"id":4251,"ended":true,"length":517,"gen_text":"Living in Brighton, Valiente took up employment in a branch of the Boots pharmacist. In 1971 she appeared on the BBC documentary, Power of the Witch, which was devoted to Wicca. She married Richard in 1976 and had been using the surname Valiente for most of her married life.\n\n\nHer relationship with Richard was strained by the break-up in the late 1970s of her first marriage to an American-born jeweller. She said of her husband: 'He is the strongest man I've ever known and the most powerful I've ever known. But he seems to exist in his own universe'.\n\n\nValiente was always fascinated by the supernatural but it was the Wicca movement that came to dominate her life since 1968. In particular, she loved the concept of 'The Seven Mountains,' seven sacred forests with a magic elemental power underlying each one.\n\n\nOne is thought to be the Tree of Life, which contains the blood of God, and the others are 'The Four Horsemen', meaning there are seven known and prophesied to descend on earth to bring their apocalypse.\n\n\nValiente found that the ritual in any of the seven mountains can give magicians the power to call a lightning bolt, create storms, or perform some other devastating power.\n\n\nShe started the first lodge in the Tree of Life in 1971 which was so successful it has developed into a full-time business. She also founded a similar lodge in The Horse God's Gate, the fourth mountain on the Tree of Life, in 1981.\n\n\nValiente is survived by her husband, Richard Valiente, and one daughter.\n\n\nIn her autobiography, It Takes Power to Raise Them: The Life and Legend of the Seven Mountains of Wicca, Valiente said of Wicca: 'Wicca has been in the news a lot lately because of what's occurred with the new owners at the Ordo Templi Orientis' temple on High Street, London.\n\n\n'But it is just as exciting for people who have never even been interested in Wicca to discover that we could be an important part of your life, because not only does Wicca call on the wisdom of all the ancient cultures, it brings with it practical tools that we can use as part of our path.\n\n\n'This means we can do more than just study the teachings and rituals; we can make ourselves a real part of the movement and help make it better. The Wiccan view of life is not one of isolation from society, but of being in it together with it.'\n\n\nA memorial service will be held by the Shrine of Tranquility on Sunday, 24 March at 2pm, at the Ordo Templi Orientis, 8-10 St James Street, London, WC1E 7LN. It will include a reading and the chanting of the Seven Mountains of Wicca.","token_len":598,"entropy":[2.5485,9.4521,0.8421,11.2846,5.1931,0.1151,5.7182,1.8937,8.0431,1.8506,1.5789,5.5253,0.1039,1.1657,8.4004,6.3842,2.2976,3.1698,3.5064,5.056,2.4192,5.8887,0.8933,0.9983,2.4566,4.6838,2.723,8.7436,1.5387,1.6765,7.9943,0.569,1.7002,2.4507,5.878,0.0882,8.3266,0.2566,0.0403,0.6756,1.7907,5.2256,3.5732,2.6428,2.9545,0.9424,2.2752,7.098,4.8854,0.7333,3.4558,0.9882,0.0443,0.0009,1.7138,4.3919,0.0147,0.3356,2.4647,0.0043,0.2166,3.2892,0.0002,3.3788,5.0605,0.0279,0.7717,1.2367,2.8876,1.5919,1.6145,5.6606,0.1839,0.0141,4.9537,2.2365,1.5397,1.4048,0.0147,1.811,1.387,0.6302,0.2828,0.7123,3.5553,1.7088,5.0714,0.2254,4.7619,0.1197,1.2347,1.9422,4.3309,2.7763,1.162,2.3815,0.7123,0.5808,0.85,2.2183,2.7274,5.5643,1.6716,0.1169,1.9399,0.0926,0.5257,2.6296,2.0205,0.9048,4.0083,2.5667,0.2273,0.1917,0.5403,0.7097,2.4547,0.9013,6.4647,0.4214,6.3716,0.912,2.0869,0.0664,2.6343,4.4095,0.6505,0.0003,2.2194,0.0199,0.0005,1.8465,5.513,4.4846,0.0787,1.1012,3.5845,4.1653,3.1138,0.4047,2.8998,3.9987,0.1823,1.4196,0.6843,0.4796,4.6768,0.623,1.0203,0.0517,0.249,7.2598,6.6134,0.1997,3.5,4.7111,0.5608,0.5089,3.6679,0.5148,4.2872,0.0682,2.4245,2.9187,5.1077,4.2357,5.1019,2.9361,3.8375,5.6901,4.5969,2.3621,5.393,6.4756,0.7714,5.8362,2.8007,1.4227,0.1816,0.5616,0.0002,4.5643,3.9999,5.5039,0.0584,0.5688,0.8309,4.3043,0.0056,0.2176,0.6868,1.9529,2.8113,0.5431,5.8174,0.2973,2.1689,1.1484,1.0859,1.6442,1.8583,0.3441,3.94,0.7771,3.7499,2.0276,0.0674,2.3405,5.8563,4.9531,0.6282,1.1352,5.7443,3.8878,5.6139,0.0416,2.7812,4.1956,0.9143,1.2324,1.9036,1.9909,4.6663,3.8994,0.4898,0.4041,0.0002,1.3705,0.0253,0.0007,5.385,2.6078,1.466,5.2552,5.5217,6.4116,1.274,0.3689,0.6268,0.7907,3.758,4.2152,6.1711,0.6832,1.3738,0.6175,0.231,5.418,4.3609,4.7184,0.4734,1.1108,3.5449,3.8078,0.5517,2.5099,4.2913,4.2898,0.3022,5.5126,3.09,0.226,0.4918,0.0002,1.685,4.5132,3.1692,2.9172,3.7466,0.7806,2.8652,2.9119,0.0185,0.0386,0.9937,3.8494,5.9287,2.0707,5.2925,0.4549,1.669,2.064,5.9044,0.3741,0.727,2.267,0.3269,0.6223,0.9931,0.5722,2.4331,2.3088,1.4281,1.5689,4.8519,0.5728,0.2705,4.4598,2.2317,7.449,0.9226,4.7781,1.1997,2.4598,2.2737,1.0149,4.7797,0.2446,0.7132,0.4597,0.034,0.8467,1.1722,3.7941,0.2095,0.2819,0.0003,1.5471,0.0347,0.0008,3.0753,2.3154,0.0068,0.303,1.8422,0.8951,1.4334,1.857,0.0142,0.0003,0.475,1.4996,5.1266,1.07,1.5802,1.1305,0.0003,3.5825,2.7378,3.2131,0.3572,6.5961,3.0985,5.1392,0.9561,4.2255,4.0102,2.6217,1.3429,2.2234,0.5594,3.2704,0.0148,1.9394,2.1962,0.5378,2.1087,1.3241,0.0012,0.0064,0.1525,0.6638,0.0079,0.0011,1.7553,2.4746,3.4213,0.032,0.018,0.076,0.0528,1.651,0.3673,0.0201,2.5001,2.0267,4.0155,1.9888,3.1122,1.1965,0.1565,0.8674,2.015,0.3733,4.395,2.087,6.9209,2.018,1.0017,4.9442,5.6015,3.6146,0.6181,5.2515,0.0967,0.0071,0.0155,0.0036,0.0004,5.2965,4.6343,3.222,4.6938,0.3814,1.0286,1.5819,0.2646,0.5787,0.0002,0.1278,2.8416,2.8496,1.5304,4.6083,0.7228,5.7139,1.9736,3.7148,0.8462,1.2203,2.4898,3.0414,4.1258,3.3584,0.0387,0.8307,0.0014,0.0035,0.6381,1.5915,1.4725,4.2529,5.4211,0.9615,4.7446,1.7854,0.6077,0.0154,2.1452,0.3333,2.1848,4.2961,5.688,0.1155,2.2062,0.6736,0.0011,0.0044,4.9184,3.5357,1.1057,4.5361,0.318,3.1096,0.5914,2.3001,2.6354,0.9125,0.9904,4.2826,2.3353,0.0167,5.9869,2.38,1.9055,3.8641,0.4989,0.2931,4.5395,4.4688,0.0019,0.1711,6.6057,1.6578,0.2303,0.0002,0.1095,4.2316,3.197,2.2015,0.5118,3.6278,2.809,0.6054,0.6372,4.1871,0.9037,3.5903,1.9155,1.9498,2.3187,0.3733,0.0884,3.276,3.374,3.054,5.0987,0.1521,0.0014,0.5919,5.0896,1.9969,2.1216,3.4053,0.5266,3.6959,1.543,3.8138,2.857,0.0328,0.576,5.8219,0.3948,1.0231,0.4374,2.5281,1.5844,0.3429,3.2177,2.9524,1.9393,0.967,0.4488,1.0783,2.9149,2.6188,2.5093,2.2492,1.6013,1.9552,1.2875,0.5236,0.0002,3.3264,2.2298,0.2674,0.665,0.2053,0.014,5.6023,0.5831,4.7062,0.3719,6.8434,1.3874,0.1944,1.6518,2.6501,0.8768,6.1938,2.5055,1.2238,1.7357,0.3927,2.4617,0.778,0.7084,3.6861,0.2416,0.0147,0.0066,0.0069,0.0064,1.3745,5.041,2.7665,1.1743,3.2351,2.2276,3.0788,0.0871,0.1845,1.375,1.4344,0.8455,2.3908,0.4727,4.2553,1.7911,0.1712,5.2189,0.4241,3.354,0.6904,1.2562,2.0997,3.4583,5.5788,0.0374,0.8508,2.7836,0.559,0.9512,0.2609,0.0012,0.0335,0.5988]}
{"id":4446,"ended":true,"length":571,"gen_text":"The London Fire Brigade used the `` dramatic and distressing `` events of EastEnders to publicly highlight the devastation a real fire can cause, urging viewers to be more aware of how to protect your homes and families in the wake of similar major fire incidents. The agency sent a message to people urging them to '' watch out for dangerous fires and to follow safety advice to ensure their homes are not at risk''. An email from the brigade warned fire crews and emergency management of similar fires after real-life incidents during the show. The messages were included in footage shot during scenes where a large blaze ripped through the basement floor of the EastEnders' Easton mansion. In scenes which aired in February, the fire destroyed the home and left Easton looking like a \"festering wreck\" the fire brigade said. ``It is now more than 40 years since the tragic fire at East Enders, and it is more than 25 years since an ordinary fire can destroy such a magnificent home, and the damage suffered by the Eastons, and there is no getting away from the fact that such a real-life fire is a serious threat to our homes,'' a fire service spokesman said. ``This is a reminder for everyone to ensure that they have a fire alarm, have a fire permit, have a plan in place to protect their home, to understand the risks and to take every precaution,'' he said. The fire brigade said: ``Our message is to 'watch out for dangerous fires and to follow safety advice to ensure your homes are not at risk'. ``We would also urge people filming at the scene to also understand the risks that fire will pose to the local community. ``It is important that you use the Fire Service phone number - 0300 000 5500 - during the filming of dramas to report their observations and for the Fire Service to send information about a fire safely.''The London Fire Brigade was used in EastEnders to warn the public to remain extremely cautious about their homes and to make sure those around them were ready to help them. In a scene where a resident had to carry a terrified woman through the front door of their flat during the EastEnders fire, the fire brigade used their own words: ``A real fire can destroy something as big as Easton and leave a woman looking like she has been run over by a truck, with the ground around her engulfed in flames. ``Make sure your home is safe. Make sure your family are all right.''The fire service's role in the latest TV production is not the first time they have had to deal with such disasters. In December 2002, EastEnders' production team were left in tears after an accidental fire destroyed the Easton mansion and left producer Paul MacLaren and EastEnders' star Alan Partridge - who was asleep at the time - desperately trying to protect the entire filming crew from the inferno. It is not known how many parts of the television drama were filmed at the Easton mansion.","token_len":598,"entropy":[8.4183,4.3504,0.0261,7.0903,2.0891,12.4236,15.1658,3.9197,5.8413,0.0187,3.2047,5.6928,1.5349,9.6382,3.5374,0.001,0.934,7.5154,3.9442,0.4017,7.6516,5.7547,6.3737,0.3596,0.6046,0.3541,2.3513,6.088,2.905,0.2402,2.4515,3.2529,1.4077,0.093,3.3303,2.7797,2.5871,8.0822,2.6854,1.4975,3.4996,2.929,0.4974,2.9507,0.0021,5.2852,6.3883,2.9514,1.2182,0.3561,1.7747,4.929,5.3871,1.3327,2.257,0.7045,4.1977,5.1779,0.1172,0.1277,4.1181,5.6571,0.7535,0.2083,4.3389,2.7,1.1685,2.6407,4.0555,3.6104,0.4789,3.2085,2.1917,1.7747,1.2168,0.5492,1.4312,1.7081,0.0234,3.4923,5.5454,4.3714,1.573,0.6522,1.6511,4.4852,5.4345,2.0802,3.2891,2.4921,4.6451,6.1469,5.6455,2.451,4.9297,4.462,1.3206,0.04,1.2583,5.2679,0.6486,2.3761,0.7971,1.3582,4.3652,1.0285,4.097,0.3142,5.8546,3.4615,2.4197,4.2656,2.9545,1.8637,4.0281,0.97,2.8124,0.0323,1.1993,5.314,6.0415,0.1078,1.5181,0.8283,0.4241,0.0039,2.0619,2.3611,3.7545,2.881,0.7968,3.0914,4.1642,2.9453,1.795,1.441,2.6551,1.1129,1.3615,1.8894,3.668,0.6857,3.2816,1.423,2.5622,3.0775,0.3878,4.2757,1.5485,0.4099,3.9161,3.8692,1.5447,0.0029,3.4915,2.2168,4.9649,1.9048,0.3506,0.3627,0.1576,4.4684,2.3214,1.279,4.6298,3.1791,0.4872,5.381,0.1518,0.0216,0.7248,3.4113,0.5999,0.6684,0.7007,2.3908,0.0674,1.6779,0.8493,2.4286,0.6652,4.3968,0.0814,4.256,0.0426,0.007,4.4269,5.8945,0.7688,5.3405,2.1857,2.6149,0.1626,2.3171,0.8762,2.3429,2.2491,3.1631,2.9875,4.9778,0.567,1.3453,1.8137,2.7691,3.6029,2.242,5.8589,0.8945,1.1575,4.7236,0.0993,0.0167,0.2703,0.7732,0.1003,3.4695,0.8169,4.6155,2.2674,0.0157,0.6059,2.1742,1.6766,4.393,2.5708,0.1666,2.3918,0.9492,1.0428,1.8225,1.9704,0.9132,0.2625,0.0563,0.238,1.1594,3.3204,1.1363,1.1124,1.4462,2.6548,1.7507,0.9652,3.3343,1.0145,0.9812,1.4501,1.7247,0.8192,1.5638,1.7567,2.5308,0.9558,1.2656,6.3378,0.9625,1.5876,0.9037,2.4282,1.3593,0.0104,1.4673,1.4882,1.179,0.8621,1.2721,3.3409,4.5894,0.9636,1.5232,1.4093,0.9635,1.9121,3.9119,0.5882,4.6306,0.3533,0.2348,0.0255,1.3363,1.9949,1.0338,1.8471,4.9021,0.0958,4.4275,0.9939,1.0271,2.201,5.8522,0.5946,0.0422,0.0841,0.1083,0.0129,0.5513,0.1145,0.0049,0.0342,0.001,0.1102,0.0008,0.2697,0.0482,0.0971,0.0036,0.0016,0.0008,0.7486,1.2184,2.1778,2.1922,1.4715,1.7937,1.5253,7.8354,4.3622,1.7078,0.6201,0.4951,4.9191,4.8109,0.4596,1.0106,3.8681,1.9111,4.9719,0.5905,0.7224,2.2504,5.1772,0.513,2.1851,0.8095,2.7175,0.3038,1.9322,0.7336,2.5763,3.8218,1.6798,5.0054,0.87,5.43,0.6604,4.4714,0.7831,1.0902,4.8645,2.3191,3.7349,1.112,4.2413,1.6036,2.0319,0.7195,5.0435,1.4103,1.9734,6.8852,2.7859,1.6133,4.258,2.2629,1.3102,0.1551,0.1383,4.1817,3.7068,1.3111,4.992,0.483,5.517,1.0693,6.4479,3.5783,0.0695,0.0084,3.4265,3.728,1.9573,3.3958,0.0323,0.0006,1.1001,2.8724,2.7196,0.4878,2.1368,5.6098,7.2936,2.1268,1.6278,3.9549,0.5927,1.8087,1.6512,4.2524,0.165,6.2345,1.3901,0.0749,0.8075,4.0608,0.2518,1.5617,1.4747,1.5458,2.2915,1.8587,1.8246,2.2088,1.5168,6.1604,3.9139,1.3455,5.5749,1.1856,4.737,2.2119,3.3185,0.6744,3.4794,0.4365,0.9817,1.8684,2.5998,3.9783,0.9377,2.0813,0.1567,0.0061,1.0935,0.2864,0.3242,1.6341,0.3136,2.9645,3.9799,3.0634,3.0803,3.4978,0.1091,3.997,1.8707,0.0785,0.1562,0.3983,5.9068,1.1062,4.2865,0.085,2.0131,1.3946,2.3203,2.3964,1.7516,2.5363,2.3788,0.2797,1.1105,0.9734,0.3987,3.687,0.1564,0.4464,0.0775,1.7316,2.8938,2.8724,2.767,5.7641,2.2194,0.0366,5.3312,0.1824,0.4696,1.1978,1.1399,4.6465,0.0839,1.6099,1.8109,0.2254,2.0704,1.747,2.6241,0.0513,0.8418,1.2549,0.7651,3.5862,1.5599,1.9053,2.4634,1.8964,1.0829,3.2328,4.0906,0.6126,0.7306,6.2339,4.3135,4.6147,2.1563,1.7537,0.4728,0.048,0.0617,1.6135,0.0541,3.7087,0.3756,2.1883,0.0051,3.3015,3.8571,0.3985,1.0138,4.105,3.4728,0.2073,3.365,0.0492,0.0004,2.6164,4.3287,0.7855,1.3325,3.9577,3.0508,1.2089,0.7041,3.1636,3.8615,0.6491,2.8492,0.832,2.7169,2.2942,1.2492,2.3055,1.7292,5.3262,4.5012,4.835,3.4156,1.0381,1.7946,3.8836,0.2653,0.0023,1.0353,2.3769,4.4999,3.8775,0.0001,5.1527,0.5995,1.3276,5.5821,1.6627,0.022,0.0087,0.1381,4.5043,0.5669,0.0066,4.1803,0.8567,5.329,5.1355,0.6399,1.3233,0.2587,2.1166,0.0038,0.1241,4.1102,1.9262,1.381,0.7839,1.4916,1.4628,6.792,0.3538,0.2244,5.3514,1.2226,0.6313,1.9388,1.0481,0.5545,0.5864,0.6199,0.7029,0.9359]}
{"id":2583,"ended":true,"length":563,"gen_text":"The World Figure Skating Championships, first contested in 1896, was regarded as an all @ - @ male event since competitive skating was generally viewed as a male activity, but there was some debate over the presence of females. The first female judge (later dubbed the \"Queen of Figure Skating\"), Lillian K. Rodehagen, actually competed in the inaugural contest, a victory that put women on an entirely new level of international recognition. This competition eventually produced some of the earliest Olympic ice hockey records and the first women-only events were established. Female competitors appeared at these events for the first four gold medals won by the USSR in 1924 and two of the five in 1938 and the US Women's Team never came out on top in any of the four Olympic finals held before the Soviet victory in 1936.\nFischer, Liana, the first woman to place in the top five at the US Figure Skating Championships (1971), was the first to win medals for the Soviet Union. Fischer also placed second, just ahead of Rodehagen, at the 1972 World Championships, while his teammate, Rya Oskariev, came in fifth. Later in 1974, Fischer was declared the World Figure Skating Champion by officials representing the countries that won gold at the 1976 Olympic Games. Rodehagen, who came in third in her final event, returned two years later with the US Team to win five gold medals. At the Winter Olympics in the newly created figure skating events, the USA won five medals and Russia won two. At the same time, at the World Figure Skating Championships in 1974, the USSR won five gold and two silver medals and the USA won five silver and two bronze medals. The Soviet Union dominated the sport during the early years of the Games, winning three of the first five World Championships and dominating the Ice Dance and Figure Skating medals in Winter Olympics since then. The USSR is still the only team to win a gold medal in all six Olympic Games, the most ever. All Soviet teams during the time period where Soviet citizens comprised 70% of the athletes won at least one medals during that time period. Other nations have competed at Winter, Summer, and Olympic Games at different times during the decades, with many countries competing multiple events. This section focuses on the overall results of the Olympic Games, regardless of the event: overall medal count for nations, medal count for countries, and medal count by gender. The following data has been compiled by using the latest data available from The International Skating Union (ISU).

{"id":3044,"ended":true,"length":526,"gen_text":"Before the introduction of vaccination in the US in the 1960s there were more than 500 @, @ 000 cases each year resulting in about 400 deaths. In developed countries children were mainly infected with measles in the spring and autumn months when the infection was most easily transmitted to adults because of the lower percentage of IgM antibodies in circulating children.\n\nAn interesting finding was that the prevalence of measles in Australia increased from 2-6 cases per 100 000 during the 1890s to almost 70 cases per 100 000 by 1940 in the Northern Territory and 80 cases during 1945 in Victoria and South-East Queensland.\n\nA substantial decline in the measles incidence was observed from 1939 to 1948 but it resumed the following year; a slight decline between 1949 and 1952 was followed by a small increase. A decrease of over 75% is observed from 1954 to 1964 with a large increase in 1965 and another reduction followed in 1966-1968.\n\nA decrease in measles incidence remained fairly constant during the 1970s and 1980s and then began to increase, to an average of over 10 cases per 100 000 during 1994-96 during the second half of the century. In 1996 the incidence reached about 20 cases and continues to be increasing at about 7% per year. At the same time, the frequency of measles is very low, averaging <0.1 case per 100 000 in the years 1991-96 (the last survey).\n\nThe major areas of concern relate to the increasing proportion of the population who are unvaccinated, particularly in Queensland where the proportion of vaccine coverage in 1989 was 92.8% as against 74.4% in 1989. The large increase in the number of cases and deaths in Queensland represents an increase in risk per infectious unit, and a smaller increase in the risk per infected person.\n\nConclusions\n\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious disease which can cause a range of acute and convulsive symptoms. It is transmitted by an extremely cough-like contagious cough similar to that caused by the respiratory syncytial virus. The first symptoms are usually the characteristic rash and conjunctivae, followed by paroxysmal cough and fever. The rash often develops over the site of the cough. It usually worsens within the first three days and remains present for several weeks. The primary symptoms are paroxysmal cough, fever and chills but there may be other manifestations including pneumonia, pneumonia-like illness and encephalitis. The primary symptoms often resolve spontaneously after 10-14 days and the characteristic rash usually disappears within 1-2 weeks. Measles is an extremely infectious disease, with a high mortality rate of about half a million cases each year. Among those infected it is found that about half die and the death rate does not decrease with time. Most complications are complications of respiratory illness.
