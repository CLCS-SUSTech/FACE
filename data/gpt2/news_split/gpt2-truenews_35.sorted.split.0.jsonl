DOE claims the U.S. has provided three- to four-meter volumes of nuclear fuel and other nuclear materials with no violations, even though it said it could not get permission and is not authorized to discharge any such material on the site, or where it could. The company contends the three-meter volume was created because the DOE requires it to deliver plutonium, which is more than twice the legal limit; one kilometer would be enough for a nuclear power plant with a capacity of 5,000 megawatts to meet the requirements.

{"id":3417,"ended":true,"length":191,"gen_text":"The United Nations on Friday urged the Sri Lankan government to urgently implement reforms to end war-time arbitrary detention and strengthen independent monitoring of tough legislation. Sri Lanka has used the 1979 Prevention of War Resolution as one of its signature instruments to secure its independence. The resolution allows the government to prevent serious and indefinite detention for any period of time and has provided for the provision in several areas of its constitution of protection against arbitrary deprivation of liberty.\n\nIndia was also among those condemning the Sri Lankan government during a public meeting in New Delhi on Monday, warning that it could not afford to give up military leadership in the new year, after being forced to turn back from the international community in response to the kidnapping and assault on a Sri Lankan Buddhist temple by a mob, with an aid from China's military. China is reportedly now offering Sri Lanka's military up more than $100 million in assistance in the hope of helping with the eventual resumption of negotiations but that is expected to be increased.","token_len":199,"entropy":[6.9248,2.5412,5.2597,1.9088,2.7791,1.2246,8.3706,0.1233,0.0246,0.1057,0.1311,5.0789,4.7986,2.8885,0.8846,4.9162,6.9413,3.695,4.1259,8.6619,0.5294,1.3156,6.9625,6.6512,4.6776,0.9333,11.5516,8.1545,1.1665,6.0345,0.964,1.6532,5.2409,1.4689,7.9806,8.5855,0.0652,1.1294,3.1468,3.351,4.8897,0.1933,0.3056,3.6193,1.8961,1.2179,4.4284,1.0503,2.0267,0.9844,2.4251,2.0434,4.7181,1.0678,0.7616,0.1599,5.0366,5.6959,3.865,4.781,0.4303,2.8391,4.1919,2.7205,0.2643,0.6536,2.349,4.1512,4.235,1.9855,1.5486,3.8223,4.9216,5.0678,3.9717,0.3848,4.5743,1.5263,1.6321,4.6509,2.1185,1.0703,5.4224,0.7602,0.8063,0.7247,1.0987,0.0006,4.9921,4.4573,2.4656,3.3041,1.4682,4.8632,0.3218,1.26,0.0133,0.0037,0.1725,6.2346,1.1538,5.6118,0.9847,1.2395,1.6236,0.1027,0.9351,2.8736,1.4642,5.03,0.766,1.5238,2.7855,2.3401,2.7688,0.3157,4.2808,0.4125,4.8496,5.4114,1.7409,0.792,6.6091,1.4468,2.5214,4.0255,4.4724,2.2388,0.3484,4.683,2.12,2.281,1.294,3.4467,1.1593,2.0735,3.4552,0.0736,1.2129,5.2139,1.3893,5.4318,1.5946,1.1488,1.3778,0.0062,0.0011,4.7824,1.2816,2.517,1.9355,2.7702,3.9989,5.0617,3.8465,5.7612,1.2444,3.7997,4.0589,2.8292,0.5508,4.3999,2.6949,4.4558,5.1276,4.9724,3.6383,0.7041,3.3893,1.9997,5.5161,7.4272,0.368,0.2983,2.4789,0.3092,1.6676,3.1861,2.8105,1.1664,3.4868,0.3898,3.7948,4.1687,1.4496,5.3916,3.6334,0.0154,0.0157,2.4367,6.4359,4.376,2.3011,3.4858,0.0292,0.7226,5.5265,2.211]}
