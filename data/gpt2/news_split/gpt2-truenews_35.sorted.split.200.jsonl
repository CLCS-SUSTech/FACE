Energy is a key priority for Filipe in the coming months as the country contemplates energy policy reforms for five years. In November, he promised that he would deliver on the country-building programme. The head of the development ministry said on Monday that he was considering cancelling four senior posts, including one for energy. He also said he wants to bring on the National Climate Assessment (NCA), the first-ever analysis of the impact of climate change on the planet. This new assessment has been set up by the Department of Energy and Climate Change on a five-year baseline study. Environmental activists say such the assessment will be an important one amid growing frustration over the long delay in making a contribution to UN report on climate change. Climate experts contend the delay is simply a reaction to new demands for changes to the climate change target, which they say are unlikely to go through.","token_len":215,"entropy":[8.9482,5.7762,4.1472,4.1973,6.7657,3.5018,0.0041,13.1399,8.3359,2.8735,2.1061,8.4241,4.5941,3.5212,1.7672,1.259,5.69,3.714,3.0403,5.7599,2.8521,2.6397,4.5934,1.8588,0.7362,6.9432,1.4789,0.2338,5.0359,0.6543,2.1234,2.6113,4.4236,1.5881,2.5985,0.8703,0.3896,12.0779,5.85,2.2405,1.3447,3.313,0.6804,3.3425,0.0545,0.0018,3.9227,1.4474,3.4043,1.1532,1.9065,1.5301,1.0757,5.5676,0.0,4.7681,2.082,4.6705,5.0235,5.3265,0.1892,0.5673,4.9301,4.3439,0.4689,1.6274,4.9022,3.4598,2.1901,0.1484,5.3683,1.1783,1.8401,2.0964,5.7044,1.4584,4.7758,1.9018,2.5771,5.3299,0.0071,0.597,5.9863,1.242,4.1236,2.3348,1.6255,0.4166,2.3958,1.7314,3.4768,4.9922,0.2045,4.6019,5.3407,3.6067,1.8388,0.8721,1.8728,1.6567,2.2837,1.5446,3.1126,2.0143,1.3654,1.5069,6.0569,0.3766,3.6469,3.4432,2.7201,4.9461,5.3335,2.6649,1.9516,0.1857,0.3414,1.3093,2.0319,2.842,4.7901,0.0287,5.0542,0.3012,1.3842,2.4002,0.0592,0.3579,0.0182,0.2823,0.7402,3.4355,0.5154,5.6134,4.9897,2.4152,3.3233,0.8676,4.6234,0.7733,0.5076,0.555,5.1061,0.1751,0.9397,0.8274,0.2929,0.0038,5.9769,2.0277,3.3464,0.0388,0.0345,5.9694,5.9774,1.357,5.5886,4.503,2.1923,4.5652,5.7518,4.9907,1.7409,1.6098,3.7683,1.7739,4.9871,6.9736,2.1733,5.5777,0.8131,0.8707,5.7726,4.3761,0.3402,4.463,2.1407,5.7396,0.3583,5.5835,6.9125,0.8145,0.5278,0.025,0.2726,5.1833,3.7291,7.0944,1.8094,3.1084,1.7776,5.4995,1.1702,5.4757,0.0515,5.2719,4.6991,1.7091,5.1662,1.1641,0.5182,2.767,2.1763,3.04,1.9065,0.8891,2.4254,0.5388,2.6439,4.617,0.0594,4.2938,1.8957,0.7175]}

A key area of focus with Iran was the nuclear program which is under way amid growing tensions with Iran's neighbors, particularly the Republic of Germany, whose strong military cooperation makes it easier for Iran to get its supply of nuclear technology to Europe, Turkey and the United States.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Reuters, http:\/\/www.reuters.com","token_len":218,"entropy":[7.6511,4.3084,0.0027,3.0306,1.7284,2.2785,1.9869,1.4213,6.73,0.2518,0.4629,3.1515,0.0211,10.3767,3.597,2.7331,11.8541,1.6974,6.8157,0.092,5.0455,4.6894,5.6652,0.0175,5.0019,0.7645,4.2964,3.769,1.7332,1.5333,6.5409,0.1271,11.1333,6.0908,3.4583,1.8713,0.4299,1.475,2.161,0.0654,0.0331,0.0029,1.2972,0.0614,0.0003,0.0013,0.4517,1.4111,4.1936,4.5056,3.837,5.281,1.3823,4.2665,1.565,3.7443,1.9391,5.0884,2.5488,3.7353,2.6473,2.9346,0.0862,0.3542,4.6458,2.7325,2.694,6.9367,0.1377,5.5203,0.5076,3.3507,1.9598,1.0218,1.9224,0.0685,0.437,7.0322,5.5859,4.3222,0.4078,5.933,2.8291,0.5721,1.1509,1.4681,0.7935,1.8225,3.1018,4.2513,2.4949,0.9182,5.6038,2.9572,1.7177,5.7104,4.7076,5.4303,1.3823,0.0003,5.0999,1.597,2.9241,2.0,2.3592,0.1523,4.8784,1.79,3.8539,1.9542,2.0988,4.7277,2.2073,4.6676,2.9566,0.1751,0.2028,5.1011,2.7376,3.5374,0.1474,4.424,3.1978,0.7761,1.7802,0.5056,5.7135,1.9708,0.7166,0.0835,4.5722,0.0882,7.1541,5.2338,4.6775,0.9988,0.603,4.4118,2.4108,2.051,2.3797,4.7242,0.6462,0.6701,1.5739,5.2404,4.6452,5.602,0.4183,1.6776,5.9057,2.9874,2.6387,1.6866,3.1692,1.7657,5.1913,2.3073,2.6219,2.9024,4.6651,3.0286,1.6636,1.9176,3.352,4.6341,3.3042,2.1106,2.74,1.8621,6.8356,0.0046,5.4514,1.4871,4.2971,4.782,3.8469,4.2274,5.7719,0.7143,4.1624,0.2937,1.4182,0.0602,3.875,1.6853,6.0066,0.4451,1.8469,2.9864,1.4219,4.2341,3.0181,5.3306,0.3903,1.3527,0.676,0.1393,0.1221,0.4855,0.0002,5.4049,0.0054,0.0003,4.3652,0.0128,0.0533,2.5215,0.1562,0.2176,0.0004,0.1202,0.0003,0.0329,0.0002,0.0015,0.0026]}

He also condemned the U.N. for not taking action against the rebels following the failed Geneva talks.","token_len":218,"entropy":[4.9328,2.5934,9.8827,4.5067,4.9064,0.0421,1.7586,3.1998,2.134,2.1396,0.3641,4.1418,0.8736,3.7732,0.2937,2.9485,1.736,1.8019,10.4239,2.8518,1.0166,7.9534,4.9967,9.694,0.9095,2.8053,0.0012,5.9065,4.0367,4.3151,1.1515,1.1846,2.9309,10.2424,0.4585,6.5754,7.4695,0.2168,5.9769,0.9303,2.164,5.5507,3.7486,3.0181,0.9077,1.6572,5.2701,4.3697,0.85,0.1076,1.0979,1.3797,0.0005,0.0694,2.1746,4.0352,1.4015,5.9297,0.9416,0.0775,0.5941,0.0003,0.0084,0.2945,4.3572,5.1042,0.8319,4.4409,0.4179,0.3274,0.971,0.6269,0.4107,0.0002,1.4546,1.3302,2.9281,0.2425,3.3411,3.7451,4.0474,1.0043,3.8376,0.1589,0.4223,2.5396,3.372,4.2853,4.9357,3.0203,2.0555,0.2889,3.8776,2.2018,2.0666,2.5137,0.0014,0.205,0.0917,3.7486,0.9565,0.0736,0.0006,0.0011,0.0001,0.0,2.6296,2.4326,0.8498,3.0029,1.2449,1.095,5.2516,6.1367,0.5125,5.016,3.2597,2.2472,1.3044,3.906,0.169,1.5494,0.0852,1.7827,0.2408,0.0002,3.1539,0.0014,0.0004,0.9032,6.2415,0.1733,0.2369,11.3222,4.1297,3.1815,5.6709,3.9185,0.5415,0.6254,2.5756,0.0475,3.2434,3.4324,0.5786,2.7916,0.0205,3.5498,3.5067,0.0019,4.0521,0.0259,2.5812,1.8951,4.8924,4.131,1.6303,0.8051,5.312,4.8288,0.9864,0.7214,0.0002,2.5936,2.5981,1.2732,1.5279,2.3497,0.0005,0.083,0.2038,0.9224,4.7076,0.4904,4.4963,0.627,4.0849,1.6246,5.7944,0.3778,4.2045,5.2952,1.7395,2.9815,3.3692,1.8288,1.9896,0.0004,0.6154,0.3101,0.5584,3.85,0.4065,4.2982,2.674,0.9704,2.673,1.6474,4.6019,0.8006,2.1366,0.0004,1.0472,0.6054,1.6261,2.4865,2.5409,1.91,1.6781,1.0072,2.2823,6.2046,0.8336,2.9691,3.2943,0.3379,0.5112]}

The four officers were killed on Thursday night defending a police outpost in the northeastern state of Chad, sources said on Friday. The incident was initially believed to have been an attempt to sabotage the police and police security operations, the official said. The police source said that the police officials have identified those involved as those who carried out the killings. Two days after the killings, officials have yet to identify the shooters and authorities have still not released the names of the gunmen, sources said.A police spokesman said the killings were not linked with Boko Haram, who were also active in various tribal areas north and south of Amritsar. In Chad, police officials said at least seven police officers died after being shot by what appears to be a self-made pistol used in the massacre, which happened around noon on Tuesday after a midnight ambush in the city, near the village of Cawahle, where there are about 800 people living north of Amritsar.","token_len":219,"entropy":[11.0313,4.6058,2.6877,2.8646,6.764,0.2632,2.1319,5.333,6.7933,0.0947,1.4083,2.0486,6.2587,5.0446,1.7277,0.1053,9.4416,0.3156,1.438,3.0533,3.0958,1.9788,0.6172,1.0422,2.3244,0.1588,2.5183,3.7294,1.15,0.6327,1.32,2.7009,2.4658,3.5456,13.4702,1.2692,1.9607,2.6115,0.8889,0.7256,4.2317,0.6425,0.0909,3.6323,1.2012,5.3268,0.6144,4.5208,0.5497,0.1191,1.8849,3.6326,2.4027,5.3345,2.0291,0.0175,1.1194,0.3843,2.1347,2.5081,0.4234,5.1047,0.7393,1.6507,3.8342,3.4812,4.6705,3.5021,1.6199,1.676,0.1943,0.324,0.1747,1.8017,2.6479,4.8316,0.6848,1.572,1.1442,3.3368,4.0004,3.6808,5.3925,5.9239,1.5025,1.8034,4.5688,1.0485,4.3562,0.0181,0.0962,1.8532,0.4266,4.7972,4.1506,1.5432,0.1891,1.3481,0.1894,4.759,4.662,5.525,0.0015,2.3975,0.5531,4.3784,2.9715,3.9513,0.7278,5.624,0.1239,2.9197,0.8983,0.6636,0.1446,0.4314,3.4896,2.2821,2.0419,0.1652,0.1193,7.1589,2.7255,2.2687,0.8447,1.4296,3.5122,1.0038,2.3065,1.8987,3.7619,2.0352,0.0003,1.1061,3.7185,4.2902,2.6233,4.3723,0.274,6.5845,4.8224,0.6378,5.0446,1.7085,0.6668,0.0459,5.856,3.8056,0.0081,0.0001,0.7757,3.786,4.0287,0.1662,3.4031,3.1642,0.9618,3.444,0.0078,3.1122,1.9508,0.167,3.7054,2.7655,1.2739,0.517,1.8739,5.9701,4.3045,0.0026,0.132,0.6823,4.5102,0.0012,3.0547,5.0202,4.3751,1.6243,0.4902,3.457,1.5674,0.879,3.2923,3.5289,2.5155,0.7515,3.2762,5.4928,1.3071,4.6047,4.1955,1.3834,1.0918,3.166,4.4712,4.4369,0.6643,3.3561,0.0194,5.5847,4.1217,3.6519,4.9726,1.7413,3.2353,4.745,1.2692,2.1495,4.5543,1.3915,3.172,7.5221,0.1598,1.0981,0.0003,0.0067,0.0018,0.1788]}

The new proposals would include taking away the value of any pension plan that is not already in place.\n\nEuropean investors worried about Russia's plans","token_len":219,"entropy":[7.6235,1.3066,0.0036,2.1209,1.6103,2.2212,5.6599,0.622,1.371,0.0073,0.0006,1.2715,4.3048,0.9603,1.6871,6.3739,9.433,2.4169,3.1053,0.7351,0.7512,4.8062,6.5309,5.3415,0.8923,2.0079,5.237,2.0912,4.8548,0.3366,0.8812,5.3101,6.1342,0.0415,3.6659,5.7089,6.2429,2.6136,1.8009,2.1165,2.7788,3.9945,3.0769,3.0296,2.0058,5.5608,4.6283,3.4757,3.6137,0.6588,3.0439,3.8038,3.7542,2.4781,4.9282,0.1053,0.8029,4.7257,5.3631,0.3655,1.3499,3.8894,4.1857,1.1672,4.2082,2.9824,0.3493,5.3459,0.1703,4.7003,0.7015,3.1542,5.2943,1.8145,0.6749,2.6773,0.0866,1.2551,2.5523,3.6578,4.6056,3.0209,5.8861,2.2706,5.6652,4.0067,0.5606,5.294,0.4071,6.0445,3.8502,3.4436,4.5816,1.7303,0.2547,4.4898,4.5645,2.5395,2.635,4.1303,0.3213,0.5729,0.0004,6.0576,5.9912,1.7825,3.8537,0.0062,2.6892,3.2209,2.2669,1.5409,0.7013,4.8908,3.5309,1.2655,1.8292,4.2128,4.0083,0.8289,1.4751,3.456,3.4751,0.6044,3.6961,3.5031,2.5487,0.087,5.1842,1.2559,3.1568,2.3487,1.9969,1.0512,2.2631,4.3109,5.268,4.4053,1.6494,0.0343,0.3559,0.8484,0.0002,5.2452,3.7482,0.4845,4.7291,4.3809,4.8924,0.7201,1.7277,5.4502,0.18,2.0731,2.0508,3.7352,5.1331,0.8225,3.9927,4.2173,0.0557,0.2305,1.5581,0.0012,1.6791,2.2445,6.7465,4.1874,3.9225,4.0894,2.4017,5.1131,0.4818,0.5455,1.8934,2.5657,0.9601,0.6778,0.013,3.1235,1.3844,5.5434,1.653,1.2149,4.5849,4.5859,3.9779,0.5274,0.9952,2.7101,4.0954,3.6538,1.8562,5.0438,5.4919,2.7935,1.7734,5.7923,0.0782,4.5468,2.0131,3.2195,1.8951,1.6919,1.6357,2.9148,1.4383,0.746,1.511,0.8259,0.0002,4.3133,3.7665,5.3083,1.4384,4.256,0.2733,3.8863]}

The Russian defense ministry rejected Washington's plan to send air defense systems to Syria, fearing that the rebels would have the weaponry to carry out strikes.","token_len":220,"entropy":[10.9314,6.2817,5.3972,0.0324,0.0591,0.0131,3.2503,0.5604,0.0041,11.5143,6.7304,4.4687,0.0105,4.6088,1.3791,11.0984,6.294,2.0349,0.6501,3.8398,7.0748,4.0464,8.4765,6.4843,0.0194,4.4495,2.1747,5.9268,2.001,1.0314,5.7713,4.8739,1.7839,0.1303,2.7858,4.4736,4.7458,1.1104,4.2578,4.048,1.6132,0.9724,1.0418,1.0412,3.4086,4.6448,0.9196,0.2067,2.312,2.5469,3.9991,2.306,0.7535,0.0004,2.0829,2.6592,4.6146,0.0753,2.8425,2.0195,4.9239,1.1087,4.4602,4.0394,5.0807,0.0427,0.9079,1.0499,0.0003,3.6381,2.8297,0.9387,0.8311,0.004,1.0102,4.7232,3.8342,1.5613,0.7591,5.6274,3.8256,5.2205,5.9474,0.8563,2.7377,2.4903,2.4531,1.4811,0.7253,1.1805,0.4812,2.9468,4.5568,2.0007,0.8071,3.7676,1.9913,1.4666,2.3823,1.256,0.0712,2.6244,5.5791,2.2922,4.8605,0.0082,3.5831,1.4231,0.2268,2.269,0.9381,2.5302,6.0961,0.2272,3.6009,5.9043,4.6814,4.4024,0.0656,3.2769,0.0113,2.1608,0.9852,0.7263,0.3058,1.3097,5.3617,0.1036,1.2387,1.8512,0.977,0.3601,0.3973,0.0003,2.6644,0.0007,0.0325,0.0667,1.2575,3.05,3.8137,4.2756,1.7213,4.2133,0.0063,3.9928,5.7549,0.1301,0.5281,2.6046,1.5074,3.3822,0.9356,1.1731,3.8908,3.0334,0.254,1.1643,2.7773,2.2295,1.8391,1.8325,1.4778,5.3448,3.0098,4.9537,0.184,1.4632,0.007,0.518,0.5678,0.0003,4.2831,2.6263,3.6313,1.7803,4.983,1.7054,0.0003,0.0653,0.1998,2.6339,4.9962,0.7563,2.5736,1.8385,1.1111,2.288,2.9097,2.5074,2.6238,3.001,2.8273,0.1135,6.5705,4.0,0.0476,2.9823,0.9647,1.8058,4.0238,2.5532,1.0272,0.5609,2.5183,1.2569,5.6856,1.6318,1.8608,3.0756,0.8165,4.2267,3.2288,6.3712,0.6437,2.9996,0.037,3.0969,0.8456]}

While Bernie Sanders on TV said that he would \"do our country a favour\" by calling on South African police to \"solve\" what he sees as a corrupt police state, Hillary Clinton suggested that the African Union was \"curious\" about the police state and claimed that it would be \"a catastrophe\" if African people were not allowed to vote and participate in democracy.","token_len":220,"entropy":[8.7955,1.9633,8.8622,4.0464,0.0751,7.3212,1.4487,5.1979,0.95,4.036,2.1713,2.302,6.2014,0.2263,0.6316,5.7131,1.4408,0.008,1.5051,0.6349,1.8796,4.1794,0.1342,10.3488,8.8672,1.6062,0.1597,4.4446,0.1908,12.3633,6.1895,1.1308,1.0581,4.6036,0.1132,0.0004,0.0,1.0607,4.5365,0.0061,1.987,5.1084,2.454,1.8609,3.5458,2.021,2.0865,2.5603,5.203,4.2522,0.72,2.6238,0.4745,3.0061,3.5697,6.0365,2.8506,0.4381,3.3059,4.4352,0.7679,4.3453,1.1866,5.0508,2.5914,1.8052,1.8091,0.0228,0.0035,0.3316,2.3665,0.3875,1.0745,15.3702,4.6264,1.043,0.2503,1.63,5.4007,3.5892,5.2634,4.9747,1.9631,5.5958,6.1243,4.4687,6.1898,4.4396,3.4973,1.0855,3.6814,0.2928,3.3234,4.2603,0.077,2.063,0.6396,6.1511,0.7311,5.0747,1.2088,0.9468,6.1861,0.3419,0.0357,0.7814,4.1292,3.2034,4.196,5.1384,0.0565,0.1548,0.8526,0.0221,0.2057,4.6366,2.3549,1.3366,3.3859,0.1732,5.6866,4.7121,3.9555,0.3241,1.232,5.7952,2.1199,0.8649,4.785,2.895,5.3328,0.5055,0.6152,3.099,3.6026,5.3098,0.4937,1.6067,3.6554,0.9996,4.3418,3.5879,2.2769,0.46,5.4426,3.8226,0.4208,6.4757,5.4069,2.0069,1.5089,1.043,1.3865,2.4821,4.0463,5.6996,1.4186,0.2621,2.3603,0.3635,0.5882,4.5147,1.9963,1.7935,1.2019,1.0056,0.1448,2.2727,5.7927,0.5982,1.1,4.9238,0.546,4.3845,0.0299,1.2671,4.087,2.0607,0.4362,0.3356,1.3415,0.0841,4.6929,0.3776,1.8966,4.0184,2.2289,3.1549,2.0916,5.6665,4.4704,0.7334,0.6888,1.0946,3.895,1.1804,1.582,5.3628,0.3078,2.6632,2.5445,1.3597,1.3051,2.3005,5.3181,0.7436,0.354,2.2448,4.0666,1.3298,1.9321,0.919,0.0751,0.4142,4.7201,5.7307,0.2128,2.8541,0.1723]}

The drugs enforcement agency, known as PDEA, would play a crucial role in policing the massive drug swindles of the Philippines' far east. In November, the president also ordered the police to hand over the names, photos, details and arrest warrants of suspects using drugs in drug-related crimes. Authorities said they were also planning to send a team to meet PDEA, a joint federal task force with special partners. However, it is unclear how the meeting was actually held or how many people were involved.

The change would also allow local jurisdictions and mayors to impose policy limits on sanctuary cities and would provide a new layer of security to local law enforcement.","token_len":222,"entropy":[10.2958,4.373,2.264,4.7534,0.174,3.8084,2.0957,5.163,5.8369,3.1738,0.0004,0.0009,0.047,0.3839,1.8731,6.5884,0.008,0.0004,1.5454,8.7953,3.4593,5.0373,0.4511,3.3829,2.5606,3.0747,2.8938,0.5095,0.0595,1.9444,1.6184,1.3967,1.2629,2.0135,3.0991,13.2953,1.2145,5.706,0.1496,0.8263,1.8742,3.7135,0.2913,4.6991,5.7237,1.3007,0.8611,4.2677,3.4717,0.368,2.6054,4.3929,1.9017,1.3955,2.5865,0.5635,1.0457,5.083,0.9478,4.6896,0.3556,0.2599,6.4547,4.0848,3.1171,2.6721,1.9923,0.9377,2.0726,3.0046,2.35,1.5289,1.2802,0.4779,0.0003,4.3451,2.1681,3.137,1.4243,3.0335,3.9749,0.2355,4.1883,5.1741,1.1264,3.659,1.0102,5.0497,3.3642,0.0655,0.2757,4.1357,2.4751,2.9422,4.8857,4.6338,0.7337,1.8016,4.1305,1.8628,3.3628,1.0517,1.1878,1.054,0.0002,2.0994,1.5854,4.6553,3.6291,1.1057,4.7142,0.0222,2.1995,0.084,1.0488,4.8441,2.136,2.8249,3.8237,2.8807,1.2323,1.5452,0.3157,4.262,0.1041,0.9628,2.3827,5.6933,4.2564,1.3741,3.796,0.3584,1.7862,5.7384,5.1591,1.5067,1.8951,3.2924,2.5326,3.6549,1.829,1.1763,1.0239,0.3609,0.0002,4.4272,3.2955,3.8173,3.5635,4.6157,2.3014,2.5575,0.668,1.2494,5.2153,2.1964,0.2305,6.9484,5.593,2.1483,5.6268,4.4848,2.1287,2.7339,0.0686,2.3565,1.3271,4.4758,3.8184,1.5615,2.457,0.0341,3.0727,0.038,0.802,4.3998,2.3568,4.254,0.9476,1.0676,2.7046,1.8609,0.0069,1.728,0.1635,4.1386,7.5544,0.0211,0.0128,5.0408,2.3458,1.575,2.9067,5.6746,0.837,2.4704,1.7769,2.3277,2.5386,4.6177,5.9498,0.1252,5.2687,5.6186,4.3915,0.3935,2.3816,0.544,2.6614,3.8706,3.792,2.8595,4.1188,4.7956,0.0238,2.6913,1.4539,1.9512,1.358,0.0058,0.7181]}

Assad last month asked Moscow to ease more restrictions on civilian flights, saying they risked violating Egypt's neutrality against terror and extremism and risked causing chaos in the region, and a new round of military strikes on Syria, to end the violence here and help to calm a chaotic situation.","token_len":222,"entropy":[7.6235,1.3065,0.0036,6.4151,2.9977,0.3041,7.614,12.834,3.756,0.2049,0.155,0.0002,0.0001,0.9393,0.0096,0.0016,0.0177,1.8157,2.4031,1.2575,7.9649,0.2841,4.3407,8.7498,3.46,7.5701,4.6636,7.0629,6.5625,0.0073,1.7322,1.7713,0.0353,2.249,5.2133,4.7472,1.4273,4.2755,5.4097,2.1078,1.0333,2.4,2.71,4.9155,1.7187,4.9565,2.0602,1.9444,4.1538,1.4809,4.3648,2.713,1.7726,2.4573,0.8055,0.9057,0.4405,0.0089,1.1453,0.4579,5.6382,2.3125,1.8881,3.0184,1.8367,4.2928,0.0207,0.0002,3.2251,1.8152,1.4954,2.2075,1.5614,4.6167,4.7423,1.662,0.0008,2.3813,1.4046,0.0194,2.5012,0.0094,2.9265,4.2121,1.9626,1.8222,0.3394,2.26,0.8835,0.1811,3.1186,5.9997,2.6908,2.5607,2.4291,0.0043,5.3706,2.7809,4.8051,0.8248,1.7667,4.4984,5.434,3.9043,3.8801,0.5212,2.852,3.0181,2.6703,0.4495,5.0183,0.5564,1.0955,0.3387,3.7263,0.1895,2.252,1.6948,2.2679,1.5878,0.5843,2.3723,3.3054,2.1397,3.4605,0.0262,4.8192,2.8431,4.7608,0.4172,2.3975,0.0849,0.7662,6.2008,0.3319,3.5101,5.0955,3.3444,4.7511,4.1575,1.8776,5.6776,3.7269,2.8249,5.1019,0.0063,2.2332,2.6049,1.5177,4.4103,1.6601,0.7368,0.329,2.4863,0.4975,1.0519,6.7839,0.0009,1.8013,2.2573,2.3878,2.3382,7.7521,4.9519,1.0361,0.2177,2.8218,5.7927,1.1367,5.2033,3.402,0.3328,3.8885,6.7437,0.529,0.2854,3.5915,0.225,1.6779,1.7617,2.5532,3.7488,3.9209,2.7256,0.008,5.5144,4.5027,3.7358,1.9983,2.6552,2.9188,3.8234,3.8856,2.669,0.8343,0.8422,2.0721,3.1607,3.205,3.8733,3.8782,1.4075,0.0061,1.9934,2.0493,1.5079,1.9439,3.7504,5.0187,3.6097,0.8752,2.7809,7.3977,3.6728,4.1292,3.5235,3.094,3.0474,4.5016,2.2036,0.7612]}

Officers with riot police converged on Trump Tower for one of the last acts of defiance to the presidential candidate's campaign in the past month, calling him out when he seemed to be getting away from his campaign's slogan, \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Associated Press, http:\/\/www.ap.org","token_len":222,"entropy":[9.9689,6.0928,0.4207,3.1472,0.2207,1.5276,3.437,1.6788,2.8531,4.0519,5.0159,0.0582,0.0211,0.0672,2.1457,0.1972,0.0063,1.6101,2.5448,1.0399,0.2883,0.704,0.6356,2.7881,5.4186,4.8904,5.2683,0.0007,0.0659,1.1569,0.7694,1.565,2.5458,1.3747,0.1897,0.0338,4.7564,3.6646,5.5366,0.434,3.6357,1.6288,1.7919,2.5406,2.8632,2.0279,4.9551,2.803,2.4753,1.5074,0.9389,0.5806,1.7518,0.0003,5.8239,3.0918,5.2062,0.1538,0.3327,6.1128,4.7629,1.4105,6.5008,3.1534,1.6559,2.6473,6.8296,0.7607,1.0897,0.6229,2.3315,1.5607,0.1726,1.9423,5.68,1.4135,1.4702,1.5396,3.5124,6.1271,1.2768,5.2457,0.3481,0.6553,0.4048,0.5993,0.0002,2.249,3.5481,2.4754,3.6594,2.8617,2.4655,4.6438,2.2677,2.432,0.6259,4.3388,3.682,2.9291,1.4042,4.6733,1.4532,0.0482,3.7399,2.4744,0.0037,1.2757,2.1637,5.9029,2.6732,6.0925,3.145,4.0183,0.8401,0.9496,1.0407,2.3491,5.6374,1.7797,0.4209,0.3135,2.2048,0.4997,4.193,1.9243,3.3055,4.1556,1.1633,5.6146,1.0432,0.1083,0.0002,2.1416,2.1947,5.8011,0.9677,2.7848,1.8506,0.8812,2.6386,1.7816,0.0592,1.4973,4.9817,5.0756,2.1537,5.0786,3.3737,2.6088,0.6241,0.6465,1.1481,5.4236,5.181,1.2716,3.9601,5.0546,0.0002,0.5179,5.5134,0.3177,3.0067,5.7546,0.4687,0.3073,3.7889,5.3901,0.0209,3.2913,2.9764,2.1702,4.2057,1.1016,1.2808,2.3311,3.5911,1.3757,3.2039,2.8244,1.5433,4.6192,2.1048,2.1302,5.1392,0.4697,5.317,0.7138,2.3934,3.6996,3.4537,2.0105,1.87,2.3836,3.6836,4.718,1.9719,0.0674,0.1647,0.0084,0.0158,0.0031,0.0802,0.1881,0.0002,5.4495,0.0019,0.0004,4.3202,0.0047,0.0126,1.9971,0.0009,0.1008,0.1332,0.0003,0.616,0.0003,0.1896,0.4941,0.041]}

The change in the Senate's bill and the Senate's will go to conference, meaning there's a chance the final deal will pass on Tuesday.","token_len":224,"entropy":[8.4708,3.6716,0.5622,2.9813,0.0052,0.0043,0.0037,0.8903,0.7354,0.0011,3.3881,2.3094,2.1696,0.1167,6.6194,2.1677,3.8212,2.9968,4.4007,4.0484,3.9017,2.2153,3.1794,2.0161,5.895,6.7566,8.9535,0.9241,0.9598,0.0693,1.8102,2.9359,2.3837,1.105,2.8104,1.5586,4.0002,7.4649,0.2802,4.7923,0.8075,2.3511,0.6352,1.4798,0.8306,4.9242,3.5708,0.0189,5.3502,4.9581,1.3521,1.5393,4.5613,1.3973,1.5743,2.3812,0.4586,5.3494,0.757,0.4005,1.8733,2.3849,8.4417,2.4132,2.7423,1.0206,2.8528,0.3978,0.0259,0.9811,3.4914,0.7038,2.3331,2.4704,2.7669,1.6686,5.2026,1.7288,0.491,3.8356,5.3632,0.7871,2.2714,3.2516,1.0527,0.6051,2.3722,1.9967,3.7006,2.0793,5.5162,1.192,1.8907,5.6072,5.4988,2.7771,2.0075,0.1135,0.3802,0.0003,4.9751,1.2885,1.9678,2.6273,0.095,4.2031,0.0151,4.069,2.8437,1.2114,1.2965,1.854,0.3674,2.382,1.2962,3.6742,0.5803,1.1983,5.0274,2.1269,6.3982,2.9375,5.7538,3.7102,2.743,1.0228,5.7493,0.6405,2.1646,1.5477,3.3916,1.4861,0.0335,0.1895,0.0003,2.8859,2.4009,0.0046,3.9225,0.0087,0.036,3.7196,0.4231,1.9554,0.4427,0.7834,0.0006,0.9028,0.056,0.0282,0.1201,0.107,2.6708,0.013,4.8512,2.0979,1.2552,4.3191,5.4021,2.8259,1.9039,2.4244,1.9547,3.1569,4.4113,3.3603,0.1039,0.3032,0.1708,0.8076,1.7185,1.973,3.3692,1.8735,3.9514,0.0047,3.3333,3.1604,0.362,3.669,2.2844,1.4295,3.0389,1.7076,2.3461,0.0217,6.1848,4.4865,0.2629,5.0714,1.8468,0.4678,2.6764,0.3593,2.3677,6.1106,2.1971,1.3363,1.0964,2.7993,1.7627,5.3499,0.9108,2.1802,0.1726,4.5222,4.2725,0.9653,0.1617,3.0915,4.1163,3.4457,1.6045,1.8535,0.9183,1.3842,2.3836,3.4261,1.5075,1.6612,3.6762,2.1873,0.571]}

The agency has been under fire in recent years for its involvement in the development and deployment of high-speed Internet connectivity technology, which allowed foreign governments and military networks access to millions of computers worldwide. According to government watchdog group Judicial Watch, the proposed nomination could see Griffin leave NASA and lead what he has called a \"whitewash of what amounts to a new national defense.\" As The Washington Post reported last month, The Department of Defense Department will be responsible for developing space systems for defense contractors, as well as for programs such as missile defense. Griffin may be more than just an administrator with a large budget. He's another government official with deep ties to Washington \u2014 he's also a top adviser to Trump during the presidential campaign and a longtime critic of President Barack Obama, who has not indicated a willingness to help him get a second term.","token_len":224,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,8.7807,0.0354,3.012,5.6045,11.1865,0.5421,0.6369,1.1035,7.849,1.058,0.2287,2.4078,3.8912,0.0001,0.0008,0.0018,0.0041,0.0001,0.0038,2.297,15.1868,0.9767,1.4522,6.9739,0.0538,0.0024,0.5238,0.6089,0.7213,3.4354,0.3447,7.0617,2.0564,2.9896,2.2615,0.0006,1.0376,1.5561,0.0724,0.1753,5.9013,1.6528,0.0215,4.3623,2.401,0.0008,0.0001,1.0152,3.0918,4.9125,2.3153,1.7479,1.7778,0.8856,2.5252,0.3429,1.1727,0.283,1.9454,3.7042,0.1,1.4937,3.0272,1.9286,1.922,0.0049,4.6313,0.0568,2.4358,2.1307,4.6176,3.1491,1.5023,1.5438,4.6718,5.0249,1.1083,2.32,2.7394,5.4403,2.5254,0.0691,4.9023,0.007,2.8039,2.3037,0.6163,5.7794,0.0008,4.8257,4.9356,2.0056,1.4129,0.0009,0.3926,1.4226,5.3892,2.3677,3.214,5.296,1.9692,4.6046,1.0818,1.7995,4.9552,5.8907,5.5687,3.621,0.6678,0.8233,0.3728,5.1385,1.7618,0.0635,0.993,1.2213,5.1729,5.8139,0.001,1.0337,5.4275,3.5295,3.7563,2.0,5.5757,3.083,1.9102,0.0734,0.7017,1.8641,1.1636,0.3145,5.1491,3.4606,0.0077,0.1894,6.6216,4.2509,2.7239,2.2984,0.011,2.7815,6.117,4.088,1.6209,4.0164,1.5609,1.289,3.4831,0.1262,0.0042,2.2655,5.2268,2.1599,0.0008,4.121,0.0941,1.6326,1.4948,5.8411,1.421,4.5344,2.3968,0.4345,1.7657,2.7835,4.3491,1.1919,5.2696,2.2317,1.1582,0.8233,2.2611,6.1732,4.5539,0.7691,2.3912,3.3851,0.6323,0.0145,3.3363,3.4851,2.4059,1.4115,1.3862,1.031,3.2862,1.9465,0.2092,2.8836,4.3329,0.5675,2.0317,0.127,2.2585,2.7627,3.841,2.7033,0.0251,2.2977,0.4473,0.0032,3.7444,0.8996,1.6551,5.4101,4.9866,2.3004,1.4137,0.0178,5.6735,1.2492,3.2535,2.704,3.5026,0.0513,0.4792]}

A decision will come if any one of you says no,\" he told APC television during televised remarks.\n\nMeirelles has received less than a week to decide whether to stand or go forward and is expected to decide late on Friday, meaning there could be no date set to say who would run.","token_len":225,"entropy":[6.2232,8.0206,0.2385,6.5863,0.1115,5.2167,1.1928,0.4841,0.0234,1.4055,1.7826,1.9994,3.1821,1.8613,3.6551,5.7623,7.1298,0.5956,1.7043,7.6999,3.9592,0.9524,0.2455,3.0062,4.1367,0.6232,1.4975,1.5716,1.8445,0.4151,13.227,6.9571,1.1549,0.3554,5.6944,0.0032,0.0015,0.0012,1.7672,0.6489,2.0268,7.711,1.2504,3.551,4.7362,1.5624,2.3151,0.0028,4.1545,5.8816,3.4805,0.1671,1.0751,2.4992,3.6963,1.0463,0.6864,1.1679,4.4205,3.1078,3.3275,5.3619,2.2374,3.4244,1.9535,3.8088,1.388,4.4048,4.8415,0.1238,5.3025,1.686,0.8358,5.3293,0.5585,4.012,0.5636,4.2873,4.0579,0.3686,0.7433,0.0003,5.3902,4.4082,0.6886,0.5932,2.5932,0.7724,0.1156,2.9223,5.3412,3.9216,1.5988,0.9978,4.7338,5.2375,5.7156,0.7777,5.7489,5.1103,6.2061,0.9698,0.2787,1.1108,3.6359,0.8834,0.8951,0.0002,2.7349,0.7754,3.3649,2.3233,1.4044,0.9508,4.6473,0.9957,5.5922,2.294,0.719,1.0901,4.5653,4.3988,1.9136,0.5461,0.0002,0.5093,0.8861,4.0507,3.2628,1.3779,0.2004,2.1678,3.6106,4.19,3.1895,3.6896,0.2285,2.3796,3.0466,1.8854,0.721,5.4783,0.0269,1.4677,1.4377,2.7846,2.6913,1.4455,4.1132,4.3031,6.1094,3.9628,2.1527,0.8222,1.3148,2.6973,0.8321,2.3829,0.68,0.0493,2.0027,5.8817,3.6456,1.3424,2.2537,3.899,5.9189,2.4166,0.6607,2.6541,3.6982,1.9973,0.8408,0.3095,1.2875,6.3442,6.9468,3.199,4.0287,4.7243,1.428,0.5282,0.2509,0.0002,1.9488,0.0188,0.0023,0.0009,2.6017,5.353,5.4119,0.3601,2.3966,2.7823,0.2702,1.7842,0.5693,0.2625,4.7587,1.9398,2.0352,3.5209,3.4797,3.0489,1.595,0.0135,3.1518,5.143,2.143,1.7657,2.6979,5.9789,3.6874,2.653,0.0916,1.7549,4.3107,1.8544,3.3281,6.0459,3.6083,1.9704,2.0241,1.0469]}

While he never advocated pardon for Arpaio, Cicillinone believes that such a punishment deserves a swift appeal to President Obama.\n\nCivilline said Arpaio's pardon has allowed Arpaio to \"stand out as the most important face of the Arizona sheriff's office.\" He also argued that the pardon will help ensure that people of color in the county get the justice they deserve based on criminal convictions during the eight years of Arpaio's reign.","token_len":227,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,7.675,2.8207,1.8727,5.7927,0.0077,3.2103,2.6435,4.4942,1.3978,1.0404,1.8953,1.465,0.3936,4.75,0.6955,3.3677,2.0714,3.2047,3.9914,3.2464,0.394,2.1221,2.0759,4.0183,5.7146,0.9306,0.0493,0.7364,1.4235,0.0021,3.7429,1.9664,0.0119,5.8813,3.2218,1.0152,0.008,0.1629,5.7309,3.2645,1.3853,0.1925,0.0002,3.989,0.0548,4.6734,0.9355,0.0058,0.0001,1.0309,0.5112,0.0045,3.1139,0.0002,0.0147,3.3311,2.4419,0.7366,1.4329,3.9212,0.3931,0.5391,2.3404,0.105,1.1657,2.3908,1.7926,1.8037,4.655,1.5466,5.7849,2.2573,1.4777,0.7543,1.0306,3.1206,4.3437,3.7341,1.9228,1.2922,0.0002,3.4212,1.5181,2.3229,2.1179,2.0735,4.9509,5.062,7.7601,5.8693,2.9051,4.6087,5.1892,3.8512,3.4533,5.5896,1.5925,4.1478,3.6961,1.195,1.3152,0.0005,2.423,3.0245,0.0016,1.1131,0.2403,0.2547,0.1105,0.2438,0.0001,1.8907,0.0882,0.0079,0.004,1.4266,1.9449,0.251,6.596,4.6283,0.1307,0.7307,1.1843,2.4309,5.3228,1.8197,1.3675,5.4027,2.4891,3.8089,3.8413,0.0096,0.0034,5.457,4.4973,0.6829,0.7921,6.3762,1.4558,5.7498,5.452,4.5683,1.605,0.9769,0.2399,2.6036,11.5183,5.8654,3.226,1.0509,5.5399,0.5212,3.9966,5.0238,1.5126,4.1563,5.9455,2.4816,4.7217,1.2496,0.7443,0.1393,0.0001,1.8656,6.5856,0.2033,0.0052,1.8116,4.1055,1.3718,2.316,3.769,5.5934,4.1677,0.2638,2.4111,5.4336,3.7823,1.9693,2.5989,2.0665,3.3783,4.625,0.5287,1.1703,3.7668,1.3012,0.1252,0.369,1.2563,2.2708,2.0132,4.225,0.1767,1.5444,1.8695,4.1452,2.0769,4.3565,0.6212,4.3627,2.1777,0.1235,2.9725,0.632,2.1783,3.3685,1.4791,1.562,0.1116,0.0856,6.3216,0.0756,5.9123,2.2139,6.3497,1.2028,4.8991,0.5759,2.0971,0.7354,0.0298,2.9406,0.2136]}

North Korean officials are pushing through new threats to Seoul and the country to prevent these incidents.\n\nWith most of the top North Koreans still away from their countries to work overseas, it's hard to see them using their Twitter handle.\n\nHowever, during Friday's game after the game, the North Korea government made a strong and strong gesture, warning viewers that \"We will not give up North Korea and the world's best friend Korea.\" The government urged the fans to make sure they're not taking revenge; one North Korean TV channel ran videos praising the North, with one such segment on state television saying: \"We are not mad.

Other North Korea players who have been present during the game have yet to address the topic.","token_len":228,"entropy":[3.6897,0.9168,0.4271,6.433,0.6159,8.8431,8.6451,1.1496,8.8183,0.7723,2.717,8.823,0.9064,4.7793,10.5791,1.3924,1.3755,1.9642,5.6352,0.472,2.3539,2.1414,2.1201,1.7878,5.1827,4.9352,0.003,1.1067,0.5603,0.2927,1.3924,5.1385,2.9728,0.106,2.95,2.8196,0.3665,5.3405,0.9986,2.4789,3.3618,5.1669,4.3941,3.7563,6.6222,1.109,5.463,1.4546,1.9569,3.0575,4.6,3.1196,5.4168,2.2046,1.5223,0.633,0.0003,5.686,5.7846,0.7733,0.5458,6.1662,2.6834,2.4251,3.9576,4.3974,0.767,2.2488,3.2641,3.6327,4.3975,3.8102,0.3415,2.8483,1.0095,2.3638,0.1084,2.0976,3.3542,5.4767,1.7895,4.9503,4.3421,2.7528,1.5158,0.0002,4.3569,0.0342,5.7795,4.1084,0.1582,1.8506,7.1281,1.5116,3.2809,0.6958,2.2451,1.5273,3.9175,4.1607,4.8877,1.5251,4.2293,4.641,3.6509,4.9588,2.7541,5.5668,5.565,1.3697,2.8543,4.4879,0.9704,1.2139,4.1121,0.7109,6.1966,0.0509,2.9144,2.8282,2.8488,3.1211,3.32,5.3017,5.1333,1.2679,2.9024,3.596,4.6342,2.5776,1.8325,0.2359,4.3491,1.5669,1.1918,3.0058,1.5878,5.5642,5.2818,7.3816,5.1607,2.5322,0.0371,4.5057,2.2351,5.3663,5.5869,5.5208,0.5585,2.1213,4.3597,3.7952,1.6952,5.3138,3.8905,3.4634,5.2286,1.1782,2.0865,1.9415,0.0944,1.8052,2.0799,2.4637,5.6185,2.6571,0.4119,1.3852,5.9468,1.8745,2.1924,0.275,0.0003,3.8747,5.0724,3.8502,0.505,4.6875,0.2927,1.0794,4.8113,1.5093,2.6093,2.6209,5.2568,4.5157,3.7474,1.7125,4.3878,1.2841,2.2111,0.7141,2.1605,0.6837,1.8809,2.3929,5.1642,2.2802,3.1839,2.9941,4.4196,1.7235,0.7323,1.2658,1.5944,0.3634,0.8763,3.9327,0.5702,6.1014,1.2686,2.5734,3.3399,3.3351,1.5406,1.5051,5.7233,2.1715,0.5489,0.8836,1.6134,4.9046,0.013,5.4268,0.4545,3.6627,0.7615]}

It has not yet decided on a general election that could be held in the coming months but has called for some form of a referendum if it comes up.","token_len":229,"entropy":[9.0823,3.6024,0.0032,0.7036,0.0007,0.004,0.0004,1.9948,4.1828,6.4311,0.8006,1.502,11.1889,0.9828,1.8772,11.1681,3.6925,2.5514,5.0364,0.0091,1.368,7.2171,0.5767,6.3206,1.2265,1.4265,2.0641,0.2996,5.1247,7.9198,5.102,0.7925,1.0759,1.2186,5.3385,4.2671,1.5657,0.0319,6.0626,1.9328,5.6328,4.5325,1.5337,5.9425,1.1589,1.2578,3.4276,3.5974,0.3289,3.1325,5.5948,4.6397,2.7508,0.9602,3.9585,0.0074,0.7706,0.0025,1.8889,1.3079,4.0556,0.0928,0.6017,1.7376,3.2821,5.4238,0.6656,1.5894,0.5713,1.626,1.6139,3.7605,4.9745,1.2938,2.5109,0.8069,5.0507,2.2495,2.519,2.0639,3.9204,2.6383,0.1019,0.0064,3.2484,0.9281,0.0004,3.7826,0.0637,1.5592,5.9295,3.5022,2.5871,5.4222,0.9188,2.8499,0.0029,0.1094,0.0007,4.1658,3.3255,2.1037,5.2419,4.9613,2.6317,1.427,4.9652,3.9912,0.9939,0.7773,4.7691,0.0574,1.432,5.2816,0.0567,3.1449,2.248,0.1819,3.9039,3.0092,5.5635,2.6157,0.0015,0.8941,1.1482,2.0064,1.0322,2.7337,4.1109,0.4977,2.8843,4.3279,4.708,4.9442,0.9916,3.2782,3.8234,0.0478,1.6946,5.2019,2.2291,1.0849,2.0055,5.769,4.1418,0.7398,1.3298,1.8207,2.7457,0.5887,0.8693,0.0002,3.3661,0.5348,4.0061,3.0936,2.6788,1.0902,1.6743,2.2097,0.1015,4.7623,4.846,2.6005,3.8966,3.0045,0.3123,1.4234,2.645,3.759,3.6117,2.7432,3.0543,4.965,3.0344,1.7846,2.9337,0.0251,0.0049,0.0013,0.5832,3.0558,2.0963,5.7494,5.6245,0.4126,3.3773,4.8614,1.931,2.3343,4.7071,2.0348,6.0674,0.1852,3.8438,4.1614,0.5825,3.4429,1.6285,4.0927,2.886,3.1768,1.3851,0.9215,4.994,0.1479,4.0105,2.0344,2.021,1.062,0.9498,1.603,3.46,1.0092,3.2997,2.5622,4.7343,0.6086,5.3349,2.037,0.001,2.5558,2.2594,3.1659,1.5549,3.486,0.3528,1.7695]}

It's time that the public realizes we have to change who we are so that they are not so afraid of our politics.","token_len":229,"entropy":[8.1501,0.0315,4.4368,7.2946,2.1009,3.7611,2.3481,0.0188,0.5926,0.3879,0.5273,0.0008,2.2503,7.6952,2.7029,0.6418,3.8317,1.289,1.1076,8.3736,2.9988,2.48,3.9739,2.4935,4.04,2.5462,5.3708,3.3259,8.2015,6.0687,9.8509,2.292,8.6852,0.0077,1.9181,0.4796,0.1401,1.9549,0.0575,0.1783,0.2818,0.0002,3.8524,2.0243,4.3088,3.9792,0.0059,0.0897,5.1669,6.0775,0.6147,5.0149,0.0024,1.2046,0.7436,4.0178,4.9453,2.6055,1.8166,2.6398,1.3321,4.1334,1.1221,4.5117,4.5893,0.8638,4.2514,2.5178,0.9877,5.4819,3.3606,3.7834,5.273,1.383,5.7451,4.0942,1.1093,5.7786,0.836,4.0153,0.0567,3.8872,1.7443,1.267,3.9279,2.8693,2.4337,3.4858,0.1965,4.5382,1.2231,1.869,3.2073,5.6082,5.6936,1.7625,4.1734,0.6033,1.3907,1.8151,3.0389,1.586,0.0959,2.0113,1.5023,2.8732,5.7803,2.7284,1.4368,3.8284,3.1234,3.3803,1.7905,3.4569,1.1236,3.2087,2.5859,1.0924,0.114,4.5933,8.1936,0.207,0.0002,3.3076,1.5106,2.9034,6.3405,1.7607,4.7908,1.0542,5.4891,2.1011,2.0822,3.9745,0.7096,3.726,0.4618,0.5029,0.8946,0.2064,4.8929,3.8231,6.3515,4.705,2.8768,1.8765,0.7272,4.3726,1.7136,1.5942,2.0779,3.9362,0.2275,5.5595,3.5055,6.3341,0.0002,4.7028,1.7746,3.8727,4.9099,5.4316,0.3148,5.2368,0.3361,1.2649,0.0001,5.3137,0.588,5.2832,5.5768,6.5188,0.7913,0.6044,0.468,4.0558,1.9178,0.1329,0.0132,1.0982,1.7015,2.9014,2.7297,1.2692,2.9921,5.7646,4.0982,1.5955,2.8183,1.0732,2.4299,3.749,0.4669,1.5619,2.9141,4.1296,0.2868,1.6335,2.1722,1.7172,0.4538,0.0075,0.1878,3.7877,0.9221,1.43,3.2879,1.3588,4.5645,3.2793,5.2186,1.9466,2.3357,1.1462,5.8768,0.1648,0.2175,4.7896,0.4773,3.137,3.1235,1.3146,3.7715,2.2883,0.8262,2.6403,3.2986,0.9343]}

A senior state department official confirmed to CNN that Tillerson will visit with a group of officials from the UN secretary general and African Union foreign peace council delegations on Tuesday, but it would be the first time Washington and the Europeans have met with such aides, and there's a chance the visit would be a first step toward some of the key issues discussed during the meeting.","token_len":230,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.8715,0.0287,0.4187,1.4107,0.0113,3.622,5.1946,2.0984,2.4287,0.0906,4.9451,2.3488,1.657,3.8347,3.5879,0.3732,0.0716,2.6422,0.0739,0.9308,2.9944,1.0185,4.8361,1.0572,2.1822,2.0476,1.755,4.2186,3.275,9.0441,3.9395,3.2933,2.0739,1.0413,0.6501,0.9401,5.2946,1.8142,1.4046,4.6402,1.9851,4.3234,0.6292,1.577,1.6732,3.5413,0.281,1.6979,4.755,2.6875,4.5768,4.1635,2.1831,3.8049,1.8339,1.6092,2.9742,0.9561,2.5554,1.495,0.7899,0.5337,0.0003,1.8347,3.8877,0.7397,1.8326,1.7057,4.5939,1.2971,1.9858,0.0004,0.0001,1.2619,0.1213,0.0062,0.001,0.3131,0.3121,6.6603,1.7036,4.6609,0.9159,1.1612,4.4282,2.8035,5.6241,2.4356,5.4355,2.3089,3.0504,3.0036,5.7768,3.6491,3.6365,2.4182,0.0569,3.3363,0.1144,3.9671,3.9024,1.9204,1.2927,0.0013,4.8,1.3898,1.1735,3.4645,5.0555,5.6391,0.8275,3.966,0.4219,0.1696,0.1125,2.9633,4.0495,0.0031,1.7706,5.6098,2.095,0.8534,1.8717,0.0088,2.7624,0.066,0.3053,5.6315,0.7375,2.0247,0.001,0.0676,0.0841,6.8095,1.1559,0.7276,4.221,3.3583,0.6959,4.1516,1.7168,0.3579,1.4847,3.1153,2.6289,5.6177,2.9897,0.1858,0.0,1.9948,2.9951,1.9977,0.6623,5.4279,1.1098,5.0403,0.3881,0.0596,3.0365,1.3911,3.2306,0.5387,1.1574,2.4146,1.9789,4.2768,3.4014,1.9203,0.0423,2.8719,0.8408,1.2216,5.2774,4.3828,1.0056,2.4687,5.5979,0.6379,3.6687,7.0412,4.2936,5.5869,0.0002,2.7309,2.3567,2.1021,2.5728,3.6992,2.7411,0.8606,2.9373,0.2054,1.0139,5.9392,3.583,1.6098,5.4714,0.4639,1.404,2.7644,2.9958,6.6242,3.7173,3.1157,2.755,3.0125,3.2434,2.0973,1.9211,2.8395,2.0528,1.1992,3.1903,3.0653,2.2563,0.9745,5.202,2.3017,0.4777,3.2623,1.0755,4.2696,1.7565,0.7121,1.7714,0.4309]}

Sessions told the magazine that while the Senate is considering the measure, he will focus on creating a state-by-state and local-by-local database so federal grants are available to support those in need.","token_len":230,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,2.7004,5.412,5.1767,3.8929,0.004,0.212,13.0367,0.5365,1.2114,2.0615,0.6622,5.4794,0.3013,4.1664,0.8783,0.961,7.4289,3.8784,1.0769,0.0372,0.6033,1.4147,7.1594,7.0637,2.7277,1.0085,5.3293,1.5071,4.0683,1.6903,7.4018,4.4781,6.0816,0.3474,1.9419,2.3512,2.1121,0.6008,2.2583,0.6136,3.4731,0.0545,0.7033,0.2814,0.0003,6.0471,0.6968,0.0066,1.6688,4.7644,1.1331,2.8006,0.6184,3.5827,1.6317,0.4186,3.3721,0.7705,2.2271,0.7168,1.1207,5.0962,4.897,1.7427,6.9275,0.8975,0.7821,4.7504,3.0568,1.9073,2.5031,3.8035,2.5201,3.7926,0.1533,0.4612,0.7887,2.443,2.1877,0.0007,1.0331,4.9523,1.8796,2.289,0.7842,5.1362,5.5299,4.0383,6.4721,6.0113,4.2199,2.4564,3.6226,0.2461,0.835,2.9633,0.0009,0.7406,0.2775,0.0002,1.3566,1.984,3.717,4.4585,3.2122,1.0401,3.4347,0.5583,5.3318,2.5897,3.7546,0.6099,1.7661,2.3568,0.8616,4.4657,0.7644,1.3042,6.3552,0.8948,2.4404,0.9435,1.5831,2.1146,5.2529,0.9052,5.3096,1.1603,5.0754,2.2811,2.6671,0.462,4.4341,1.335,1.9262,5.0791,0.3197,5.1184,2.0447,3.5582,6.084,0.1341,5.6012,2.1337,0.7302,0.2113,1.3881,1.7044,3.9937,3.7029,0.2978,0.4862,0.0001,1.9912,2.7698,3.433,1.9664,0.0015,2.0467,1.7353,0.007,0.9025,0.4854,3.4784,2.3125,0.2591,0.7363,2.9136,3.3558,3.5311,0.1938,3.7147,0.8406,5.096,0.6486,0.8767,1.1409,4.4284,2.5171,0.0365,1.0115,2.8689,0.3358,3.4699,2.9423,1.2812,5.4879,0.6679,4.0732,1.4117,4.7567,2.098,2.0812,1.0048,2.1626,0.1464,1.6927,3.9839,4.7696,0.3258,5.133,1.3307,4.3631,0.779,0.329,0.0008,0.001,5.3439,2.9008,1.7285,0.2258,0.0007,0.7736,5.0027,3.9726,4.3506,4.7164,3.3406,1.3068,0.7519,5.0609,3.0979,2.3779,0.0871,0.3076]}

As part of his push to work with Congress, Trump has offered to extend deportation relief during the second half of his first term.","token_len":231,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.8715,0.0287,0.4187,1.4107,0.0113,2.377,2.0935,1.9048,2.7615,1.9438,8.7204,0.3343,6.522,0.9412,1.9161,3.6017,0.0027,2.7714,3.5265,9.8527,0.0348,0.0328,3.3953,2.3741,3.6117,4.128,1.3815,7.5483,2.5764,2.917,9.2881,0.0027,10.136,2.3291,1.3626,4.4965,3.1098,0.0003,0.0068,0.0007,6.4765,2.1894,2.8592,1.5526,1.379,0.7979,2.1567,1.7057,2.8875,0.1981,3.16,2.978,1.969,7.0284,0.5868,5.0265,3.907,0.4215,9.9308,1.5753,1.9889,5.3161,5.6341,2.1883,2.1315,2.4512,4.6125,0.2611,1.6117,2.6162,4.2695,0.907,1.7349,1.4365,1.9029,0.2298,2.2518,2.6214,0.0008,2.2383,1.6856,0.0011,0.1397,2.5667,3.9173,4.2258,4.7132,3.3207,1.8295,2.1125,1.5758,1.3472,0.0004,1.9843,5.7277,2.3981,3.279,5.3286,2.6153,2.5176,5.6353,1.6492,2.2896,4.9871,2.7478,2.3926,3.6472,1.1979,2.098,0.3129,3.283,1.2051,2.6288,2.5433,2.8814,0.0683,0.1012,4.8235,4.6219,5.1677,1.4448,4.7112,3.4435,2.1829,1.7136,0.0003,0.0038,0.1684,5.1986,5.8135,1.7811,2.5081,0.8734,1.0559,0.0002,3.3718,5.4427,4.4797,6.6066,4.8416,3.0841,2.6458,5.5289,1.0777,2.9202,1.7866,4.6034,0.1705,4.4205,1.6871,0.8908,0.0097,2.8804,0.1881,1.7133,0.0419,1.1249,0.0028,1.5205,3.1237,4.5628,0.3189,3.9355,5.8782,2.1952,1.146,0.6395,1.0266,2.3456,0.0003,3.2755,1.6814,4.6168,0.6365,3.8779,2.8788,3.1061,0.8007,0.3446,2.6862,5.7902,0.1022,0.8467,1.5913,4.3224,1.3977,4.9893,1.3098,1.7594,1.5401,5.119,1.3071,4.6992,0.2379,3.0805,0.0521,1.0769,1.2605,3.839,4.9487,0.4176,5.4638,2.5472,0.0041,1.1983,3.493,0.8308,5.621,0.6831,0.7914,1.0029,0.5827,1.7461,4.6433,0.7611,4.4039,5.2297,1.5585,6.911,1.14,5.5169,1.2251,0.0015,0.7622,2.5962,0.235,0.9014]}

As part of his argument, however, the Pauls say they have seen no evidence of the program being harmful to the environment.","token_len":231,"entropy":[7.5094,1.7939,10.9349,0.2634,2.7463,9.742,2.0169,4.4687,9.7474,0.8022,0.2999,5.755,5.9758,0.1288,0.007,0.0024,4.5623,1.0906,0.0059,2.526,4.5732,1.918,0.0886,1.9407,0.8032,1.8785,1.7286,2.721,4.3781,0.2517,1.4196,3.4515,0.122,7.6429,0.0006,2.2885,8.5391,0.2544,5.6308,1.4165,1.2893,1.2036,2.9553,4.963,1.3423,4.2323,2.5233,0.2243,0.2217,0.0003,1.052,5.4761,1.0359,4.6654,1.8502,0.0016,3.7181,0.0011,2.5468,0.0016,3.0195,5.4204,3.6913,1.5486,0.0952,0.0628,0.2096,2.2726,1.5466,1.8981,0.0145,2.0826,1.4641,2.917,2.6086,3.9271,0.4298,4.4553,1.361,5.1958,0.3778,0.6524,2.0569,1.9021,0.8972,1.0356,1.0122,0.2773,1.7956,1.9607,2.2188,6.0102,0.8112,4.8957,0.002,2.3719,1.3333,4.7165,0.1316,2.4539,4.0434,0.6849,3.2595,0.2371,0.0002,1.41,2.8634,6.0707,0.6011,2.0561,0.5799,1.5989,1.8076,1.1127,1.9109,0.371,2.9791,3.5343,0.3295,3.7042,5.2272,3.479,2.8442,1.504,1.0089,0.6406,0.933,1.2573,0.7562,3.443,0.0069,6.2313,1.2705,3.4568,3.4142,6.2068,0.2735,1.138,0.2177,3.0568,0.3844,0.4346,6.1409,2.7592,4.5642,1.0631,2.5375,3.9984,0.2843,0.2951,5.1775,1.0587,1.3547,0.926,4.1457,0.1806,0.0389,0.0624,1.1733,2.7497,3.1919,2.3492,4.5968,5.3594,5.4059,0.0004,2.2949,3.9612,2.113,0.1913,0.0002,3.6956,2.5748,1.7162,2.8989,2.7094,1.0274,3.0057,2.9104,3.8391,5.6693,0.8768,2.4516,1.5776,4.9304,5.1506,3.0021,0.514,3.2372,2.6765,2.1993,3.263,1.9923,3.9651,1.9057,5.2418,0.3851,1.9414,1.4471,5.3866,5.5609,1.9956,4.9877,0.4097,6.5722,3.4481,0.002,1.8949,3.3265,0.2921,6.2462,0.001,1.4847,3.6247,1.4324,2.6728,1.0129,3.1684,5.8213,1.5294,0.675,1.1499,2.6349,5.3821,1.4308,5.4771,0.7677,0.9961,3.9388,0.8569]}

Flynn denied any collusion between his campaign and Russian officials during the campaign.","token_len":231,"entropy":[10.3369,3.0663,0.7179,2.6225,8.9684,6.6519,0.3593,0.4076,3.3878,4.5599,0.0642,1.2821,8.4061,0.001,0.0032,0.0033,1.7667,0.17,0.0042,17.2987,6.4249,9.1667,1.7203,0.1342,0.0064,0.072,0.3795,2.4684,1.3401,2.7572,1.3399,11.4769,0.1152,1.1124,2.0327,2.4397,2.5476,0.7283,4.7161,1.9923,0.0002,0.0038,0.0004,1.8319,0.1041,0.4269,2.2215,3.4079,0.0021,1.6981,5.1034,0.7881,4.5773,0.6941,0.4429,2.525,2.9939,5.0675,4.9108,0.3126,1.7068,0.1973,2.6175,1.8246,1.8216,5.3462,4.6985,6.5442,1.8997,1.7986,0.9716,0.0002,5.3402,0.0011,1.5765,3.2189,0.0001,0.8404,2.3788,1.6178,1.3154,2.388,3.0743,3.9992,0.7299,4.0188,0.9734,5.2299,5.4116,4.2707,0.4794,1.0674,0.673,0.0002,0.9746,1.9103,3.1508,0.9482,2.5788,2.2646,2.2804,4.279,3.276,0.4313,2.9752,1.6419,3.2111,3.3352,2.0181,5.9463,0.6072,4.0164,2.1519,1.6868,2.5664,3.2662,1.9515,1.0292,0.9984,2.0023,0.8744,0.8383,3.3956,5.4459,2.6373,0.9553,5.2034,2.4974,2.3871,0.4201,1.7443,4.32,2.4572,0.4607,0.8258,1.8027,2.7448,0.8305,1.4509,0.7869,0.9874,1.249,2.884,3.5198,4.3955,0.9609,2.0453,1.9093,1.6182,0.665,1.9593,0.3002,0.1412,3.1449,1.5315,0.0015,2.7365,1.1042,0.0737,0.2689,0.0002,4.8555,0.0031,4.8422,0.1422,4.4605,0.0014,4.9699,5.2877,1.9445,1.0037,3.3294,0.1327,1.5179,0.4632,3.9481,2.1979,2.2487,1.9713,2.0266,0.0015,2.7134,2.9909,1.9969,4.4456,0.9704,4.5703,4.656,2.7868,2.6156,0.2987,1.6548,2.6324,5.7151,3.1004,4.4975,2.227,3.6702,4.8301,1.0515,1.839,4.6926,0.9672,4.8762,4.2165,0.0038,1.1621,4.5561,1.4911,1.8725,1.3671,5.2037,0.5438,3.058,0.3912,0.3052,2.0739,4.9533,1.561,2.7145,2.1996,1.5968,0.2307,0.0458,1.9974,0.5666,2.5147,0.513,0.5484,0.7037]}

It remains to be seen whether he would support ending coverage offered by insurers that remain on the market after the bill's end.","token_len":232,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,3.5734,2.2629,6.9202,2.0847,0.0247,1.0717,6.2837,1.4556,2.334,5.4626,8.4564,1.907,5.1068,3.9013,6.9925,0.4788,0.919,1.5544,1.0195,1.506,3.7942,5.2131,2.6928,3.5852,15.1487,8.9398,9.4333,2.8704,0.0074,14.0274,6.8966,4.7603,0.1324,1.7036,0.1503,0.0002,1.4768,2.9607,2.7341,1.2532,2.6678,2.2185,3.3969,3.4456,2.0579,4.1462,1.0801,0.0,2.231,5.455,4.2958,1.7721,3.305,3.5548,1.0571,0.7408,1.4117,2.7492,1.0203,0.2958,6.4292,2.6293,6.1111,0.5262,4.4317,4.8738,0.8406,1.2083,1.4976,5.0332,1.8907,2.2778,1.0438,2.7115,5.0769,0.4983,0.2366,0.7913,5.1948,1.3073,6.4473,0.5403,2.0329,0.4639,1.1718,1.0078,0.2798,0.0002,3.3583,2.2996,2.4176,4.8374,6.1996,0.8548,2.0511,1.9639,0.0128,2.0339,0.0005,0.7745,0.0103,0.1026,0.1294,0.3137,1.5716,0.5533,0.6164,0.0022,0.0335,0.0385,0.0135,0.0027,0.0015,0.0015,1.3852,1.071,2.3822,3.2492,0.0121,4.4475,1.923,2.757,2.0242,3.3799,2.1969,1.1972,6.9399,2.4243,1.7928,0.1406,0.5995,3.8432,3.7134,2.1987,0.0345,1.6851,0.3099,0.1192,0.4584,0.0023,0.4375,1.7999,0.9649,3.1115,1.9908,4.7299,0.3971,4.1013,1.9257,0.9746,3.2923,4.4094,2.2781,2.917,0.4782,2.9439,0.4302,3.4587,5.5543,1.3182,1.0544,1.9452,2.9742,0.0388,1.2094,0.6746,0.4888,1.048,0.4258,3.8616,0.786,0.1283,0.0217,1.9769,1.3495,3.2112,4.4371,2.6608,0.8583,1.0899,0.0001,1.808,2.6683,3.2822,0.3624,1.1234,0.6156,1.2494,4.785,2.3586,3.5138,4.1001,3.813,0.4792,1.7304,0.0333,3.5711,2.4511,3.7817,0.5294,5.0445,3.7095,1.346,0.0013,0.0012,1.0224,1.0378,1.4901,2.2566,6.4185,3.39,5.9529,0.4906,2.0772,2.133,5.1304,2.0458,0.1838,1.8557,2.7266,1.3403,3.4744,2.1197,4.707,0.8364]}

High Commissioner for Human Rights in Myanmar \"are now working to reach a consensus about some of the key issues discussed in the report.\"","token_len":233,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,3.2186,0.2076,2.8919,0.0223,0.1191,3.313,2.0746,1.8836,0.9267,9.2323,8.1944,6.9968,0.8886,3.8751,0.4442,0.073,3.5792,4.173,2.8687,0.5861,2.4297,1.2756,0.7737,0.798,1.5136,0.2047,3.9173,4.8232,0.6245,3.0447,2.2166,7.5135,2.6517,6.9529,0.0016,0.0524,0.0104,2.2222,0.7133,0.1964,0.0003,1.3324,1.3199,2.9533,1.1175,0.7032,0.0747,0.0219,1.7941,0.2946,6.5034,0.0197,2.0801,1.8948,0.0238,1.0808,6.6022,1.5238,0.5492,4.1543,5.6846,0.7061,1.0397,1.668,0.1819,1.2761,0.215,2.335,1.2616,4.0392,0.563,3.3953,0.7924,2.9584,0.1554,0.3936,0.8623,2.1973,5.6358,1.0982,0.0394,0.7082,3.6723,3.8321,3.8161,0.7729,2.0866,0.0004,0.0084,0.0848,1.5996,0.003,0.0322,0.1892,6.8022,6.122,5.6434,1.6515,0.6822,2.0611,0.0201,1.8167,0.2699,0.0002,3.3496,1.3364,1.1213,1.3967,3.1848,2.1058,3.5215,3.8226,0.8887,2.9541,1.1855,0.8343,3.5735,0.0153,0.3809,6.6159,2.3654,0.0037,4.7592,6.7538,0.3147,3.3326,3.4907,2.8703,4.1413,1.8302,2.9373,0.6005,1.0685,0.2471,0.2601,0.0002,1.22,1.0991,0.0003,0.0394,0.1026,3.159,3.5518,2.348,1.5597,5.6998,2.9834,3.0765,2.2825,4.6563,1.1106,2.1666,4.7353,3.4683,4.1697,5.088,1.7065,0.8518,6.0442,0.662,0.0633,0.0001,1.6968,4.0983,1.9553,1.2196,2.2339,4.0117,0.1886,2.5772,4.2506,3.6884,1.1745,0.6655,4.1616,6.1413,5.7388,0.2518,5.3903,1.8175,0.1949,1.0343,3.2744,2.4513,1.1148,0.3755,0.0002,1.1748,1.0052,0.0004,0.0296,0.0961,1.7447,3.1301,4.1004,0.8444,0.329,1.935,6.2706,1.2613,1.6231,0.0004,0.0462,0.1756,3.3286,0.0821,0.0429,0.1111,0.0038,3.5844,0.6377,3.2058,2.2983,4.2018,2.3169,1.3663,3.9365,0.6692,2.3655,3.8265,6.2961,0.6064,0.0654,3.0117,0.6339,5.7716,1.0977,0.7756,2.5828,1.1029]}

{"id":4822,"ended":true,"length":224,"gen_text":"When North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed an order for his scientists to test their latest missile, he was no doubt hoping for technical advances but perhaps also to reclaim the narrative after he had spent much of his career fighting to secure nuclear weapons. The country has been testing missile technology since 1953. Many have been using hydrogen fuel for their missiles, and the North Koreans have not allowed nuclear development since the nuclear talks with the United States began. North Korea had been developing its own hydrogen fuel rods during the early 1970s, and the process continued for 30 years until 2009 when South Korea tested three hydrogen reactors for new intercontinental ballistic missiles. The first successful hydrogen test in April of this year proved that hydrogen fuels can be combined with a hydrogen bomb to make multiple long-range ballistic missiles.\n\nIn any event, Kim Jong Un's long-range missile development may be another story. But he is trying to push the idea that he can create an entirely new missile from uranium and a new long-range fuel. It's impossible not to think of the nuclear deal, but it will give some of the key elements of nuclear arms control more time to gel in any case.","token_len":234,"entropy":[8.9194,2.834,0.9075,0.0062,0.0096,0.3561,6.0248,1.4936,2.5814,3.2568,3.2135,9.0329,0.1164,3.9932,1.365,5.2716,3.3029,1.2468,2.3485,2.5887,5.8053,2.729,3.9931,1.4552,9.8164,5.4075,4.3989,5.6064,3.6029,3.5938,8.5987,1.4122,8.4749,7.3043,3.2745,1.6302,4.6165,2.9601,0.0528,0.6641,2.8432,3.7051,2.5293,4.4853,2.8104,0.4093,0.4324,3.5189,5.1198,2.2707,2.1056,3.9884,4.468,1.2315,1.0279,3.8103,2.0814,6.0279,3.1287,2.9394,5.1349,5.5507,2.0093,2.6824,2.1371,2.7635,1.3262,2.5999,2.2311,2.628,1.6834,1.0304,4.3487,4.8452,4.5175,5.0398,2.7748,1.939,5.2087,4.2082,2.6451,0.5117,0.8766,0.1094,1.057,1.366,3.2445,0.2655,4.2829,2.6137,2.6782,2.3196,0.7738,1.4497,0.9678,4.6133,4.6941,0.3555,3.8247,2.3708,0.0172,0.893,1.9769,2.1378,4.3562,4.7075,1.836,5.4401,0.0574,1.9155,5.0275,1.5682,4.7347,0.4014,3.1137,4.4805,1.1876,3.0991,3.6663,6.2183,4.593,0.0048,0.0104,0.0552,0.5126,1.9218,3.9649,4.5487,2.1525,1.7532,1.864,4.4905,2.9055,0.9652,0.0058,4.7007,1.0884,1.8442,5.7998,1.6883,0.6716,5.8739,0.8032,2.8789,2.2652,0.5014,1.1544,2.3045,6.46,4.7196,0.1485,0.0147,1.2613,0.0926,0.5161,1.7589,0.0038,3.2208,4.9125,1.3197,0.0365,2.643,0.4193,0.0373,1.319,5.5308,0.4201,0.5364,1.0196,3.5322,4.38,1.6551,5.7513,3.0512,0.6977,3.3975,2.6579,1.9435,5.6822,0.2911,4.6704,1.6654,3.2599,0.5547,1.7684,1.6376,4.1604,2.7737,3.9651,0.1855,3.8192,4.1055,4.8339,2.1126,4.2797,3.092,5.3995,0.0396,0.0069,5.4699,1.6144,3.3076,1.9438,5.1583,3.9337,0.0114,1.7777,0.5854,1.6839,2.9834,3.7995,3.6008,2.9484,1.796,4.2086,4.9808,4.6158,2.8752,0.9189,5.3297,2.2795,0.6057,3.6068,4.6061,0.5499,4.5123,2.1055,0.3734,5.3683,2.8556,5.7154,1.8421,0.2234]}

They include Amazon Inc, Intel Inc, Intel Holding, IBM, Oracle Corp., and more.","token_len":234,"entropy":[8.2098,4.5602,0.59,6.5545,4.1241,2.9908,6.3937,0.0447,0.1109,0.0034,5.8184,1.5755,9.2732,0.0226,0.6325,7.6907,2.8653,7.9111,0.0401,0.0024,0.0119,3.4081,0.5075,0.0106,15.1167,9.5158,8.9719,7.6419,2.4625,1.753,3.1216,1.6027,1.2124,3.7795,3.6298,8.0187,0.2146,2.0758,10.423,6.6375,2.6072,0.0027,2.7456,0.3727,4.327,0.4201,1.8489,5.1529,2.2916,1.0665,0.0012,4.8419,0.3044,2.3906,0.2326,0.0703,0.4957,2.1436,0.0014,0.0008,0.0298,0.4492,0.3263,4.3598,5.979,0.1246,1.4002,2.9548,6.1396,4.8008,6.164,0.1332,2.0579,0.0205,1.1851,1.1962,0.6074,0.5786,0.0088,0.044,0.3065,0.0552,2.797,0.3,2.4507,5.2885,1.2887,5.8394,4.1594,4.1348,3.0117,0.6495,0.0889,1.0171,0.28,0.1424,0.001,0.482,1.3609,0.0003,1.9993,2.6589,3.4827,1.0929,7.1572,5.0117,0.9291,1.359,6.757,1.2451,2.99,5.9553,2.5995,3.3067,3.5933,3.6192,4.4912,2.1987,3.9016,5.1217,0.2041,2.7137,4.6118,4.4666,2.1668,3.875,3.8825,0.051,3.464,0.0555,4.6014,3.2508,4.0553,2.229,3.753,3.2285,3.2313,3.5641,0.4868,0.193,4.9024,1.9533,1.1916,0.0669,4.1365,4.1054,3.4885,2.6583,4.4429,0.0614,3.8045,3.1586,1.868,2.1089,5.5516,4.2659,1.0826,0.6399,3.3268,1.1083,3.9443,1.4356,2.3171,1.3475,1.803,3.0794,5.0376,0.0586,3.7785,4.1014,1.2045,2.3547,3.4042,4.6587,0.1743,3.2108,4.972,0.9221,1.3642,0.1889,4.7865,5.4666,0.517,4.7159,0.497,0.5712,0.9703,0.4704,0.5902,0.0005,5.494,0.0352,5.6242,3.4006,1.7091,3.8011,1.0272,4.2175,3.3706,2.2297,1.4015,5.477,1.96,2.7725,0.0713,1.566,1.9117,3.6262,4.3593,5.1732,3.3164,1.1245,4.6166,1.0082,4.2562,1.8143,3.8566,3.2488,1.4159,4.2388,3.0957,0.4286,2.8628,6.0788,1.9545,3.9415,1.4555,4.5005,0.746,2.0114,2.4433,4.8566,0.2148]}

The government has also used the blockade on the main roads of Pakistan, giving the government greater power to arrest militants and detain their families, the military says.The new accord has triggered angry responses by Taliban members including their tribal chiefs and prominent politicians for their continued defiance of the agreement with the country's prime minister.In a statement, Brigadier General Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan, the chairman of the Pakistani military's Pakistan People's Party, said the new accord included new details to deal with the blockade and the security forces had agreed to release some prisoners.But he also blamed al Qaeda who have been battling some of the militants for the blockade and blamed the government for not bringing any change in their position to protect civilians from terrorists.","token_len":243,"entropy":[8.1745,6.5192,9.901,4.1719,8.4439,2.6447,0.8412,0.8386,0.7874,2.9958,2.6719,2.6495,0.5878,3.5781,2.1987,7.3692,3.5683,1.2576,1.4635,5.2721,11.8501,6.9254,0.9068,2.8021,9.0987,0.8978,6.1827,2.9841,5.5157,3.9766,10.9035,0.872,4.2391,2.7266,4.3181,2.0572,4.3136,3.5589,3.8801,0.7402,3.9841,4.8201,2.8609,2.0695,3.7278,0.8562,2.5218,0.6938,5.0112,0.735,0.8058,2.0583,1.3535,4.8729,1.1084,0.0015,3.9915,0.2093,0.0024,0.3875,0.7001,1.4269,2.8397,7.7615,4.6681,0.8838,3.7709,1.9285,1.6939,2.5656,4.8198,0.8556,6.4982,3.3145,4.7281,5.0602,3.4845,4.3686,0.0001,1.0869,4.1157,1.3948,2.9063,2.8623,5.0199,0.6884,0.5983,0.3321,4.8835,1.4482,3.3313,2.013,0.0087,1.2998,0.0848,2.0552,1.8625,1.901,1.0464,2.7582,2.945,0.6387,0.7921,4.3242,1.8824,4.8419,2.4528,1.6308,2.7582,1.9152,5.8796,1.5951,2.587,4.9467,2.4187,0.6544,3.6432,3.5855,1.2871,2.6929,2.6673,1.7557,1.9217,3.2549,3.8435,3.3643,0.317,1.3243,4.4464,4.5368,4.0893,4.2897,4.8753,3.9598,2.8401,4.6519,2.9409,5.6992,4.5557,6.2159,3.8079,1.3832,5.0215,2.2076,6.0184,2.1114,2.8697,2.8428,0.3812,0.4311,2.5953,6.838,0.3519,5.1567,0.1434,4.7281,0.0032,0.7971,3.1433,0.9736,1.1703,0.8874,4.8786,0.1759,0.2385,4.8445,0.0094,2.7613,3.7521,0.0299,3.228,0.9996,1.2493,4.1833,0.0175,0.3701,2.2584,2.6763,0.6911,5.6154,4.4661,0.0144,1.9415,0.4532,0.6197,0.8172,2.6563,2.7623,5.461,5.0876,5.513,2.4956,4.1095,0.0208,0.7167,2.1165,1.6067,2.753,4.1819,2.2524,2.929,3.3832,0.3301,4.7338,3.2099,1.6055,1.2049,3.3658,1.7529,2.7993,4.4531,6.6589,0.5965,5.9175,1.9713,1.6098,4.7279,6.6194,0.7046,0.2021,1.261,1.3649,1.5115,0.9999,1.9406,3.7551,0.8686,1.552,0.3746,2.21,5.2948,4.0624,4.0679,2.0846,3.2004,3.3673,3.1719,5.1145,1.5986,2.7022,3.7671,0.6898]}

Paul LePage (R.) signed legislation that has allowed Maine governors to veto legislative amendments to keep the law in place while allowing new Medicaid expansion under the new law. Governor Paul LePage has pushed for greater oversight before his state and is expected to sign bills this week that would allow federal authorities to monitor Maine's Medicaid implementation.In August, Maine became the first state to allow states to mandate that new Medicaid coverage is covered more than three times if their residents are covered on a community health insurance exchange. The law would effectively create the Medicaid state through an online exchange or by offering insurance via a state-run marketplace instead of a government-run exchange. Maine won approval in December 2014 after its electorate rejected a constitutional amendment from Maine voters and voters overwhelmingly opted against allowing it to remain there.The new law also has drawn criticism from conservative members of some of the state's most popular mayors as it threatens the safety of any law that restricts insurance markets on the state level.","token_len":244,"entropy":[10.7183,2.4607,4.8386,5.7581,1.1905,2.702,0.583,1.9935,1.1612,1.1669,3.7757,1.4437,1.0626,16.1069,8.1631,8.8705,4.0113,0.5661,4.8103,3.1667,1.9625,5.8593,2.2774,1.7298,1.0787,3.3603,2.0426,0.4952,0.9592,5.3175,4.435,0.5677,2.9372,4.3298,1.375,0.9769,4.0826,3.5106,0.3134,0.1472,4.1514,4.0226,2.8206,5.3973,2.0112,1.462,0.907,0.1259,3.4476,0.0032,0.0754,0.0002,0.0,1.5182,0.0904,3.9222,1.1832,2.5056,1.4981,4.855,3.1886,1.6279,6.2096,0.1714,4.6617,5.4297,3.5447,1.4095,5.6684,1.2342,4.0007,1.0301,0.173,4.4159,4.2626,4.1013,1.9919,1.1126,2.7853,0.4855,3.5002,0.7739,0.2269,5.765,0.9592,0.0918,0.0003,3.0571,5.2259,1.1478,5.07,4.2022,6.4393,3.1694,1.331,5.3831,4.0763,1.3942,0.012,0.3375,4.0589,2.2008,0.4637,0.7481,0.6054,1.7193,4.7257,3.6581,0.0652,3.5315,3.4499,0.3974,0.4305,6.2206,1.0061,3.3696,5.3707,0.1847,1.4214,3.3265,0.015,0.268,0.2597,0.5419,1.6514,3.6479,0.1208,4.7342,1.3495,4.456,0.785,2.1287,2.7611,2.8117,5.1542,2.5717,2.5811,0.5856,4.1279,3.7995,1.6173,1.7975,3.5085,4.4322,1.5565,5.6589,2.4668,1.3009,1.5186,0.5676,1.756,2.8004,3.363,5.9503,4.0307,2.8841,2.2628,5.1905,5.1017,3.3402,3.7467,1.5586,4.3512,3.5807,4.1479,3.6792,6.5287,1.0867,2.5896,0.8761,0.3061,2.0075,4.5632,0.2166,1.644,2.1717,0.4591,0.1361,1.8414,0.2829,3.1721,6.389,1.6073,2.087,3.1382,4.0991,2.2384,5.3037,5.6412,1.6308,0.7699,3.3489,0.0292,5.1802,3.5423,3.3237,4.6492,5.0078,3.798,4.3472,1.7591,3.1338,3.817,0.8591,2.7759,4.9221,0.3975,1.9929,2.6467,1.2571,3.144,4.3554,3.6066,1.4265,0.3025,3.0511,4.9824,0.0486,8.2891,1.5905,0.7212,0.7372,0.0188,0.9345,4.8891,5.8875,3.0505,1.6209,4.6874,2.3956,4.5317,0.1962,6.1963,5.7042,0.9206,4.2362,4.2688,3.9672,3.8798,0.7255,1.4166,2.2032,0.3332]}

On Jerusalem, President Abu Dhabi President Sheikh Tamim bin Zayed Al Nahyan said Israel has a \"deep, long-lasting security problem\" which must be addressed. \"The United States has a responsibility to ensure peace and security in the region, which makes peace with the Palestinians an objective, but it also seeks to prevent, minimize and prevent the destruction of Palestinian land, and to facilitate the settlement creation and the reconstruction of Palestinian areas, so that they are fully integrated into Israel's security landscape, both through its control of land and its own development,\" Abbas said on Twitter.","token_len":244,"entropy":[7.8534,1.7902,0.9026,2.5735,1.435,2.1653,3.0254,3.4284,7.8619,0.0508,10.7234,11.013,0.4923,3.6065,0.1115,0.1285,0.6894,0.0374,0.0682,0.1136,1.3017,3.4039,5.5483,7.9577,6.0487,2.2541,6.8867,0.0065,0.6655,0.0054,0.3628,0.0236,0.3497,8.7554,1.1307,1.1297,0.0036,0.3549,1.5802,2.5927,1.8698,2.7075,0.0024,4.1385,7.3594,2.2282,0.8018,1.8152,2.1011,0.0468,5.5435,3.1437,9.3374,0.4775,0.9292,5.0876,2.031,0.7159,3.8966,0.5494,0.0553,0.0023,5.6043,5.4621,2.9336,2.3752,6.8043,2.113,0.6436,2.7126,3.7646,3.3191,1.5867,3.3214,0.895,3.8975,2.0248,2.003,3.4645,0.3044,0.0127,1.4137,2.6977,0.4019,1.4511,5.9671,3.867,2.6413,3.4647,4.1767,2.099,3.535,5.0219,4.8273,4.6543,1.6781,1.7622,1.3945,1.0775,0.0015,4.3022,1.1091,4.409,1.2255,0.5869,2.8251,3.9579,0.7425,5.463,6.9557,4.2869,0.3884,1.3462,6.4028,2.8919,2.6176,3.0111,1.9176,2.5216,0.8735,1.7057,5.0174,0.0075,2.9749,2.7333,2.2319,2.4126,6.1449,6.0499,0.3042,4.7457,8.0841,0.4124,4.1059,0.5308,1.8938,0.0021,0.0502,1.7475,0.0034,1.5593,0.0223,0.0,0.8052,3.5098,2.7118,1.7619,3.6989,5.7874,2.9604,2.8886,0.9673,2.178,3.9619,2.5793,1.0507,3.674,1.5132,0.0385,0.9925,1.0008,2.4422,1.9603,2.6398,0.0765,2.0623,1.9846,2.1569,0.2336,2.8637,2.5096,0.8705,0.622,1.0318,0.3313,1.4414,1.4549,3.5163,5.2725,3.8383,3.1421,1.7374,0.8133,3.116,4.035,3.2527,3.4655,1.7547,1.5815,4.5645,0.4337,3.5523,3.8707,4.5728,0.7007,3.0004,1.3762,4.4428,0.1641,1.9312,2.5523,1.7228,1.9845,1.398,4.58,0.6698,2.7696,6.0754,1.2663,2.583,4.2671,0.1179,1.3754,2.9083,2.7335,4.7853,0.4174,2.5026,1.5779,2.991,2.2349,0.5644,2.6687,0.7163,1.8168,3.4909,2.7459,4.1271,4.1002,2.7595,4.1854,0.7943,1.6433,0.3622,1.2841,5.3489,4.6957,1.1376,6.8172,0.2363,3.1104,3.0627,0.1246]}

The sanctions could also affect U.S. operations abroad.\n\nA senior White House official said Thursday that President Trump is reviewing these options, and that the new measures won't stop Russia from expanding its economic influence in parts of the region that are crucial for Russia's future.\n\n\"This is something our Russian partners\u2014who are working alongside us on defense\u2014will be particularly keen to keep up with.\"\n\nBut the Trump administration has said it won't use force against Russia, which it says seeks to destabilize the Middle East.\n\nIn its statement, the National Security Council said Moscow has taken decisive actions to prevent NATO members from cooperating with Russian efforts to undermine the alliance, including through its annexation of Crimea and its subsequent annexation of eastern Ukraine.","token_len":245,"entropy":[3.8827,4.4079,1.8893,9.8057,2.3647,1.4595,6.9514,0.3064,3.3074,5.135,4.3677,3.8125,0.8152,0.9401,0.0728,1.6549,1.9646,1.0886,1.3667,2.5624,4.502,0.3743,1.6398,2.0302,0.2614,6.9763,0.0025,0.07,0.0318,1.2785,0.4605,0.0059,3.8729,3.4526,0.0015,0.7334,2.7213,4.4441,5.8986,0.9625,0.0388,0.3049,3.1078,3.7518,3.9983,2.4088,0.0516,2.1834,2.6404,2.3549,0.001,2.5747,4.2574,5.6698,2.664,1.1617,2.428,3.9563,0.0858,1.162,2.2879,2.4549,4.8384,2.1206,0.0002,0.0022,0.0814,5.7989,0.4665,3.9009,1.2378,2.3144,0.6604,0.8557,1.6443,1.2458,1.7443,1.6325,2.9934,6.3885,1.9741,0.0472,1.5298,0.0002,0.0042,0.1608,3.0404,0.7488,1.224,1.435,1.9537,3.0454,3.1474,1.8092,2.7347,1.8768,0.0003,0.0049,0.1545,5.106,4.1443,1.2146,0.954,0.0003,4.0143,2.4216,3.1283,0.002,0.0416,0.6394,4.7909,0.327,3.1596,0.7828,2.4499,4.1589,6.4426,3.2263,1.912,1.5649,1.0825,1.4375,4.6757,2.2799,5.63,0.0004,4.6628,2.0262,0.1581,4.0966,0.2142,2.7233,1.1617,0.5975,5.6073,0.0026,0.8736,1.9911,2.5632,1.6408,4.7907,1.6159,2.9255,0.231,2.755,0.7192,0.5176,0.0002,1.0896,3.0497,0.8978,3.1987,5.005,4.5808,1.0384,6.2168,4.3371,1.0357,3.4038,4.9246,0.587,2.1104,3.5868,1.2959,1.3775,1.3955,5.418,3.4227,0.3741,4.3674,2.4242,0.8412,4.586,0.5266,0.0003,4.3939,1.7074,3.9724,0.0576,1.2261,2.4689,0.8371,3.6728,0.0001,4.4319,3.0568,1.5118,0.4218,1.6882,2.5382,2.1601,1.856,5.8214,0.1453,2.2407,0.0109,0.6346,2.4273,0.0176,1.2364,0.9057,0.0002,3.1537,3.2226,2.0668,0.417,0.2804,4.5627,0.0749,0.0057,0.5571,4.0485,2.0319,4.3099,5.2207,2.4962,0.6336,2.8596,5.2064,2.4411,0.2376,4.5776,0.4651,4.4593,2.4262,0.2165,2.1765,1.1081,1.783,1.7943,1.0252,3.7131,2.4368,2.6263,0.0131,0.3092,1.1127,1.6844,5.8355,2.0839,0.0722,0.7446,0.022,0.2046]}

There are a variety of reasons for why the state is looking for funding to go to schools, including the fact state officials want to spend more money on research.\n\nThe budget shows Scott's vision has caught fire, with many Republicans calling the proposal an \"outrageous waste\" and saying it will help the state's low-income, Hispanic and poor students.\n\nBut Gov. Charlie Crist, a moderate Republican elected in 2009, has recently made more public comments about the budget proposal in which the budget will cover roughly $15 million.","token_len":246,"entropy":[8.9821,4.221,2.0567,4.5061,4.315,9.211,4.2672,1.9537,3.3726,2.2643,1.9366,7.1799,0.9119,5.5502,0.0018,0.2806,10.5514,3.4306,2.7001,0.7423,0.0012,6.9751,1.9497,3.3365,3.6745,2.2984,13.5175,2.0096,2.3691,0.2457,1.6878,7.3506,2.2377,8.0382,3.4429,1.5135,4.1807,0.9247,1.3364,0.3339,0.9809,4.2757,4.6418,1.5818,5.0019,5.268,1.0252,1.7401,0.6735,1.5988,0.7145,4.9669,0.4603,5.0803,1.5934,1.2984,0.441,1.6299,2.2794,0.7943,4.2163,0.9274,3.5399,2.3071,3.5351,2.9383,2.8605,0.0005,1.1309,1.9176,3.1532,1.9927,1.3374,1.1218,2.728,0.6529,3.3306,0.2443,1.9909,0.7692,3.7315,1.8821,3.4936,0.0022,0.026,1.1553,3.9192,3.1224,2.7825,2.3004,0.0635,1.2699,3.132,0.3583,0.3342,3.694,0.9323,4.1952,2.5632,2.9225,3.4929,3.7022,0.3866,2.3708,2.3692,1.698,3.9957,2.2208,2.758,0.8929,4.0988,0.9798,1.2259,3.5367,7.4247,1.6857,3.4494,1.8495,2.9046,3.7076,0.0062,5.3973,0.0358,3.9241,5.6776,1.7303,5.4785,2.2687,3.2201,3.4393,0.6073,6.2985,1.2606,0.0856,0.6345,6.6078,1.3169,3.3465,3.0211,0.0051,3.2364,1.0143,3.1429,1.8435,1.3965,2.1063,3.8636,1.651,2.4675,2.5219,4.7461,2.0637,2.3676,1.0372,1.661,1.8143,2.6632,6.6491,2.1183,3.5424,0.2944,3.3117,1.0228,0.9717,0.5113,5.5129,2.1718,1.3404,0.0004,2.3399,2.6595,5.3255,3.8228,1.3151,4.7601,4.107,5.6655,1.2947,1.9298,0.9345,2.804,2.6726,2.3017,2.4983,2.389,3.0594,1.4887,2.3737,0.6102,0.1157,2.8063,1.3472,1.0138,2.6106,0.7067,2.1297,4.3015,1.9555,0.537,1.144,4.7467,0.1159,0.0992,4.6369,4.4435,0.6044,1.7373,0.7792,0.2882,0.9841,0.0002,3.0954,4.3068,0.0042,1.6461,0.023,1.5951,1.2496,3.8486,0.3638,4.9338,0.3574,3.7457,0.4015,1.3144,5.384,3.376,4.4301,4.0903,2.2593,1.116,1.1598,1.1116,2.6104,4.0238,3.8043,2.5072,3.1503,4.0664,5.8276,5.2653,0.7331,4.0317,0.8294,2.3472]}

In its spirit, there is no longer a limit to Yugoslavia's responsibility to protect its citizens during the occupation, particularly those who live here today.\"\n\nIt also came after the country announced plans for new military training.","token_len":247,"entropy":[6.0128,2.5358,3.207,5.8953,7.8809,0.1636,3.6875,1.6303,3.5967,7.6051,3.5256,3.1079,3.0924,3.5445,2.728,6.7023,2.7877,2.4624,1.2523,1.7528,2.3608,10.7953,0.0084,0.9397,5.1026,2.8597,4.3449,6.281,1.0425,4.2529,9.8588,10.4948,0.0254,0.6943,2.5188,0.4051,3.2696,2.051,1.9069,2.1259,4.0181,0.3861,0.8465,3.555,2.3722,2.7086,0.0584,1.5,3.264,0.4705,1.7609,3.4462,4.5157,3.8998,3.1512,5.321,5.2472,0.9835,4.6755,4.2642,0.4238,1.9114,1.4648,2.6981,2.2084,0.9505,0.0973,0.4984,2.2748,2.0743,1.61,3.2059,0.9613,2.3965,1.4499,2.1971,2.2613,2.4162,0.0587,3.6588,1.5698,5.1447,3.1014,3.7787,1.3091,1.0985,0.6131,0.0004,2.8217,5.2711,0.4843,2.5777,0.8433,5.2439,0.2378,1.6707,1.7601,1.4307,5.9246,3.2897,1.9662,5.7281,3.5692,3.0076,0.8961,6.3757,0.4981,1.3619,3.753,1.4036,6.8528,0.1485,5.1614,1.4286,1.2785,1.7374,3.7176,4.7854,1.1419,2.3691,2.7132,5.9802,4.0584,2.3723,2.3035,2.7939,1.1112,2.3318,2.9401,0.9311,1.5107,4.4255,1.5706,2.5776,3.0902,3.769,0.4025,1.5933,2.1167,1.1151,1.9976,3.5031,2.593,3.1379,3.8429,1.353,1.8811,1.2502,3.5382,1.6078,0.0143,4.5682,4.0768,5.2934,4.5615,2.5223,1.1573,0.8976,3.7768,0.2851,3.8903,1.7211,5.5481,0.7857,5.3107,1.4934,6.2724,4.4403,1.0381,1.0196,2.7951,5.2004,4.3864,0.6821,0.3467,0.9356,0.3974,0.6688,0.0002,5.327,0.167,0.1117,0.0772,1.5759,0.6943,0.0018,3.9698,3.0264,1.9945,0.118,2.5904,1.2781,0.8768,2.1158,4.4563,2.0451,1.1416,3.273,1.7314,5.7876,0.0175,2.9688,3.8572,4.7462,5.8336,0.4576,6.019,0.8688,0.5702,3.5635,1.6918,5.367,0.7748,5.1702,0.3651,3.595,1.1624,1.23,0.7753,1.928,6.55,0.9231,4.4578,2.7568,4.6084,2.4502,0.9328,4.0216,3.2187,1.8688,0.6946,0.3807,0.0002,5.2484,3.265,3.2577,1.5252,1.5704,4.0325,3.4719,2.1633,2.1934,3.7071,2.115,1.7626,3.9264]}

A prime minister in an opposition party must now resign from office,\" Papakiriotis told a rally.\n\nHis comments came as the European commission raised its sanctions against Turkey during the presidential campaign and the new laws were passed late on Friday, giving an extra week until the presidential elections to decide on new powers.\n\nEU Commissioner for Foreign Affairs Radek Sikorski was also on hand on Monday on the sidelines of the meeting.","token_len":248,"entropy":[9.1932,0.0208,9.9748,12.9051,4.6204,4.4396,3.3012,4.8625,2.1175,7.632,5.6667,4.0231,1.7149,5.2663,6.9818,0.3979,2.3797,5.586,3.8826,2.6544,5.2687,3.4443,1.0696,5.0055,3.9244,9.1903,7.7093,0.6529,12.9969,0.1763,0.0661,0.4639,11.4552,2.4728,0.7709,0.3134,0.1082,0.3467,7.9716,0.0659,0.5164,2.5135,1.0232,4.0881,3.7279,0.0,3.5721,3.5894,5.9787,1.768,5.6058,2.0882,1.6499,3.0914,1.9895,3.5055,3.9342,0.0391,1.9404,5.7188,2.0001,1.8855,0.0414,5.1916,0.8207,5.2041,0.6995,2.5231,0.061,3.7665,4.4258,1.871,0.0008,5.3698,5.7116,5.3621,2.1201,2.6829,5.1843,2.701,0.6532,1.1838,0.0268,5.2063,2.4713,1.0481,0.5498,3.0602,2.9395,3.8209,5.1457,0.0768,3.7462,2.0285,3.6939,7.0423,4.5877,5.9754,4.4336,1.8674,0.7191,4.1641,0.717,1.8475,2.9087,0.3496,4.2716,6.0741,0.003,0.2903,0.0033,0.0005,0.0001,2.6098,1.476,4.6782,0.4015,2.0004,5.0562,4.2622,1.6415,2.1873,0.4983,0.0002,1.5193,4.3016,2.1123,3.1497,3.0125,1.5045,5.3336,1.4581,1.5988,1.0361,0.0019,3.3493,1.7223,1.6522,5.6761,3.7599,1.7131,0.8232,3.1251,1.753,2.3462,4.7878,0.5078,1.4491,5.8692,0.9471,1.6184,2.7194,1.3543,3.7926,3.8999,3.3911,1.9035,5.3711,5.3688,0.0116,3.6505,3.6411,4.2117,0.9412,3.0509,5.0508,3.5276,2.5559,1.465,1.3783,0.5423,0.0079,0.005,0.0011,0.0004,1.5986,2.2198,0.7415,2.0654,0.2109,0.0002,5.2691,0.5554,0.9152,1.6948,1.7141,2.8381,5.4531,5.467,2.1244,2.9436,0.1543,0.5591,4.9613,1.2383,5.5518,2.7271,2.4211,2.5659,5.3722,5.3245,3.6423,2.4302,4.9701,1.2804,3.199,2.946,4.2954,4.5037,2.5477,3.0277,3.7258,0.8734,5.0028,1.2202,1.717,2.0741,1.5352,2.6747,4.2015,0.9616,0.3226,0.0002,4.8787,3.7274,0.8758,1.5136,0.1271,5.5334,0.152,0.0037,0.111,0.0209,0.1488,3.685,1.6754,2.7255,2.5431,3.194,0.2878,5.1442,1.1997,0.1518,0.0575,0.7098,4.3579,2.4666]}

The Venezuelan embassy responded that it was not obliged to have a U.S. dollar in its passport.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Venezuelan foreign ministry said it was not obliged to exchange a note or the identity of a Venezuelan citizen or residents because the document did not provide the documentation required to change a government vehicle in the US. It remained unaffected by the exchange, which included the name and address, and the value of any property bought with Venezuelan dollars there.\n\nBut the embassy said it had tried to keep some of the money frozen.\n\nThe Venezuelan ambassador to Washington declined any comment on the ongoing exchange on Wednesday from the State Department.","token_len":248,"entropy":[3.8715,1.6678,3.2126,11.0805,8.1004,1.6225,3.2915,2.5694,2.7143,10.4682,10.1293,2.0248,4.6697,0.4578,0.3898,4.4348,8.2363,4.8588,3.0489,1.0263,4.9707,4.8557,3.2248,13.574,4.5552,0.5333,9.1546,1.2349,7.4927,0.7315,3.3434,5.0776,4.6964,0.0051,0.0051,0.0538,3.2005,0.6771,3.2889,4.9452,0.9152,0.1569,1.4327,4.5765,2.4028,0.5025,4.0858,3.2366,2.6256,3.8109,1.0601,4.9411,3.471,2.7056,2.1389,2.098,2.6535,5.7122,0.2695,5.9286,3.2606,0.1369,0.0358,1.4062,5.0102,4.1899,4.8069,1.6109,1.3184,3.0935,1.4721,2.4022,3.3693,2.0175,2.6226,4.283,0.941,3.111,0.561,5.6539,1.5416,0.0474,5.8481,3.2586,0.0016,0.001,0.1242,0.4915,2.6615,1.4708,0.4047,0.0003,5.2563,1.8979,1.785,2.8977,3.5395,5.3318,5.0374,1.8881,1.6477,0.8666,1.1805,0.8288,5.2122,1.0485,1.8282,0.496,4.4975,2.4789,0.188,6.1136,2.8778,5.3435,1.3011,1.6705,0.7543,2.6016,4.6393,3.5269,5.4269,2.4596,1.2195,1.3094,2.097,5.013,0.102,5.1602,1.8924,2.731,0.0006,0.0014,0.1585,2.6305,1.6356,1.0866,2.2326,1.4449,0.6851,0.0002,3.7841,4.0296,0.2123,0.3927,2.161,3.6366,0.0527,1.1701,2.7409,0.9051,1.5242,3.0126,0.0958,5.1478,2.6431,6.6199,2.7932,4.693,4.9405,0.1421,1.7603,2.7409,1.4856,3.2001,5.7701,5.4576,1.3124,3.7862,3.2298,0.0026,4.5045,2.0833,5.3472,1.8449,1.2818,5.344,1.4831,4.7472,3.0111,3.5532,1.0139,5.3313,0.2033,4.0478,6.2283,6.3279,0.1965,0.3087,4.8497,2.3357,1.9285,5.5464,1.7608,2.1749,1.3036,0.8185,4.2527,2.1874,1.6936,4.5466,0.0712,3.4628,5.1409,5.1739,3.0991,5.0784,0.3597,6.6808,0.2384,0.1994,0.0002,3.7714,1.5958,2.5135,1.3136,0.9999,2.1139,6.0319,0.2936,5.0148,5.6636,0.8057,0.3418,2.2289,5.6764,2.4615,0.7786,0.0002,2.1252,2.4605,2.7191,0.7672,1.9352,4.9264,6.3967,0.9463,1.2864,0.3307,6.0464,3.1067,5.0898,2.717,5.7585,1.0842,4.3192,0.0043,0.5193]}

As part of its push, the militants have killed at least 100 civilians, including some children.\n\nU.S. military officials have said in recent years that their forces have carried out airstrikes against Boko Haram.","token_len":249,"entropy":[7.4796,0.8856,10.0576,7.6803,3.3286,8.4957,0.0019,2.9576,0.8623,0.9358,7.6421,1.973,5.177,0.3276,0.0006,0.7374,2.3029,1.3681,1.7185,0.0017,0.9004,4.4298,1.006,0.0466,1.4981,0.0091,0.0002,0.6527,1.954,5.1182,3.9273,2.8116,0.4615,0.3201,3.2365,6.2143,2.3573,2.875,0.7882,0.0696,3.2005,4.3151,2.4843,1.4135,0.2016,1.5728,2.4336,6.0262,1.0987,0.7461,4.6052,0.8255,0.1586,1.5111,0.0001,3.8072,0.4452,8.8653,4.5267,0.0005,2.411,1.4639,6.0987,0.0237,0.2109,2.1875,2.2299,3.9273,2.1169,1.1506,0.7544,0.0002,4.7922,5.2149,3.5127,1.0868,5.9026,3.5285,0.0448,3.785,0.4177,0.0475,0.8753,2.5968,5.9646,0.6142,2.4821,0.0461,5.099,3.3026,4.9907,6.6369,0.8482,4.7334,5.0457,5.9343,2.3579,2.2791,2.6732,1.6666,3.1434,4.5924,0.0368,1.4107,1.1988,0.0002,3.1407,4.1068,4.8075,1.6347,0.4362,2.4212,1.2686,3.8661,0.943,1.3415,2.2249,3.312,0.8078,3.8883,0.0003,1.5634,4.3397,0.8715,1.6626,4.0668,2.6073,2.1765,2.9278,2.6863,0.0029,5.008,3.0749,3.7014,2.7013,0.7948,4.6412,0.4429,3.4022,3.0402,5.3092,1.7759,2.2588,5.0543,4.127,5.1669,0.0451,4.4068,3.6966,5.0904,0.1939,0.1604,0.6307,1.472,0.0028,3.5451,3.6842,1.2695,1.1974,2.5039,4.3848,0.0002,0.0037,1.8321,5.7641,5.4877,2.237,4.3763,3.4391,0.5518,0.2423,0.0002,1.6759,2.5258,6.2325,0.034,6.3633,4.5688,4.6125,0.5454,2.8486,0.8688,1.7302,2.5629,2.1404,1.7844,0.6528,3.024,1.1531,2.459,1.442,1.0662,1.8624,0.0598,1.471,3.6708,5.2229,0.8748,3.2085,2.4452,4.4343,2.0276,0.9632,1.8312,1.1376,6.6659,3.2883,0.0008,2.1103,2.9524,0.6438,0.7541,1.7796,0.7835,4.5953,1.747,0.0001,3.8163,1.7764,1.6125,1.5639,3.1484,1.3241,1.406,0.319,0.0002,5.5479,0.0864,0.4518,0.2172,2.2708,0.9222,1.9342,0.8028,4.5466,0.5364,4.6181,0.2288,4.3409,1.6657,1.0736,3.0704,0.0011,3.4062,0.9404,0.7141,0.0002,3.6798]}

On Friday, South Korean Defense Minister Ri Yong-chol said North Korean officials had \"confirmed that a North Korean tactical-battery missile entered South Korea's waters.\" South Korea's military says a large number of missiles reached a southern port in the Korean Peninsula earlier this month, though they have not confirmed that any missile from the country came into the port. In its statement, South Korea's Korean Central News Agency said South Korea launched the missile while on routine training exercises. A missile carrier based in the Gulf of Thailand also conducted drills on Wednesday, Yonhap said.","token_len":249,"entropy":[8.1976,9.5078,9.5018,2.6808,0.1613,0.0004,4.038,2.7313,11.6177,3.3099,0.1326,4.4275,1.4151,5.1603,0.0727,0.0003,0.003,0.3529,5.3139,0.0968,0.0017,1.687,0.0115,2.5705,2.2723,1.446,2.9106,3.0386,11.82,3.8481,0.0001,2.4692,0.0976,0.1132,0.2997,4.5377,3.3696,1.5261,2.6352,2.9114,4.4598,2.2826,5.1524,0.7189,0.154,3.5295,1.1438,2.1674,1.0194,2.0354,2.4478,1.714,4.1502,4.1878,6.4433,5.2395,2.702,1.429,1.663,0.1574,0.7783,2.1023,1.2414,0.0926,0.7393,3.476,4.3192,2.2038,0.0002,0.1119,0.0012,0.6108,0.6484,0.9826,0.749,3.5637,0.6289,4.8301,3.6121,0.6705,2.7106,5.7351,4.0873,2.0194,1.2019,2.9688,2.6889,0.6811,0.1333,0.8326,0.0068,0.7765,1.3124,5.003,6.0621,0.4858,1.3642,4.7869,1.6168,2.5685,2.099,0.602,1.1624,2.63,2.5308,2.1669,4.9971,0.7581,1.9717,0.9018,0.1123,0.0961,5.146,0.0285,5.5768,0.9612,0.8288,1.2744,3.0861,2.9359,4.0685,3.1562,1.2707,7.4165,2.014,2.7316,0.7472,0.4041,4.2705,0.1371,0.2147,5.6076,2.652,0.9412,5.4081,1.9088,0.2384,1.5556,0.8374,2.6267,0.5073,5.2864,0.2646,1.5392,3.0375,0.0917,0.5956,2.2062,2.0938,2.7704,0.924,3.2772,3.7184,1.295,1.7456,3.2725,0.0747,5.6177,3.845,3.4251,2.2199,3.3055,4.289,2.7625,0.0678,1.7348,1.8753,1.5339,3.0123,0.646,0.9604,2.2774,4.9758,3.3597,5.6006,1.4551,0.0069,2.8052,5.9796,4.4837,5.5101,2.077,1.92,0.832,4.0769,0.5424,4.1683,0.5565,1.0611,1.2217,3.7074,3.2591,1.7158,0.4173,2.6458,1.5096,4.2832,3.3687,5.8127,0.9845,1.6021,3.7421,1.7566,0.8614,3.7052,0.2862,3.9504,4.046,1.6627,0.7363,1.6176,0.1618,0.8729,4.4117,0.6405,0.0492,0.0099,0.6086,3.445,0.6573,5.0882,1.5864,0.7183,4.7121,3.289,3.6207,3.3804,0.927,1.1729,3.1615,4.3312,5.7092,4.3823,0.6859,0.9355,4.45,0.2024,0.354,3.6493,2.945,1.9217,1.8508,1.656,1.356,4.5551,0.0002,0.9188,0.2291]}

The two had recently left home for fear of persecution as the regime's crackdown on the Shiite sect in the north intensified amid growing religious animosity.\n\nMany more arrests were expected in the upcoming days, with more than 6,000 police officers and a helicopter carrying them to safety, according to state-run Sabaa News Agency, which reported that a number of arrest warrants had been issued for all three of the men charged.\n\nThey were arrested after they appeared in a court holding on October 9 for their refusal to pray.","token_len":250,"entropy":[9.1128,10.2068,9.1886,9.8143,10.1396,3.6478,6.9,4.1199,12.1603,3.2336,2.0777,2.9068,1.8814,8.4194,0.7223,1.7102,2.5118,1.8514,1.1,4.9647,4.2892,7.1065,8.5122,9.335,3.7651,0.0257,0.7334,8.0274,0.8663,8.1596,0.9334,0.0082,6.6799,3.3085,2.6548,0.2781,6.1818,11.4028,0.9016,2.8438,3.9541,3.1191,5.8634,0.6754,3.7216,0.4702,1.2127,0.8807,2.9344,4.7706,0.0299,5.3714,0.0229,3.0036,1.7021,4.067,4.6611,0.4471,5.4591,3.493,2.0846,3.4834,6.5641,1.5208,0.8946,2.2842,3.3848,5.6101,2.7099,2.6924,4.9649,0.3929,4.22,2.3117,0.0878,5.0158,0.0318,1.991,5.1825,3.2716,5.3794,0.4424,4.6788,4.5771,3.3843,2.0266,2.5195,2.7464,2.8708,1.0849,0.2101,1.3568,0.0007,5.2657,5.1282,0.0318,4.0717,4.1449,1.3358,4.5416,4.5342,3.7993,3.0406,0.1822,5.2207,1.8001,0.0394,0.9826,2.268,5.5097,6.673,0.2463,2.4304,0.3372,0.1174,2.6396,4.1646,1.4025,0.3515,3.7733,1.9549,4.2865,3.1433,3.5568,2.0571,1.5469,0.005,5.3987,1.3169,6.2239,1.9579,0.2384,4.0288,5.5661,1.9745,3.1846,0.2327,3.5254,4.9139,1.5715,0.8366,0.4814,0.5019,2.7514,1.5115,3.6551,5.4898,4.138,4.3985,2.4584,5.5453,0.2266,3.5414,4.7183,2.7093,4.1127,2.6276,1.8659,0.4842,2.6755,3.0156,3.4223,3.7016,1.4,2.1324,2.2141,5.0985,2.8559,3.5842,4.2386,1.0279,0.5246,0.0002,5.7442,5.9655,4.8425,2.1026,2.1371,1.5051,0.7391,5.883,0.8097,1.2176,1.981,3.2163,1.4197,4.7236,0.1156,0.2518,5.0196,0.8601,1.3249,3.6309,5.3758,2.4129,4.8638,1.7339,3.3016,2.1609,1.7986,0.002,3.1141,2.0595,0.0392,3.2632,2.8141,2.5574,0.1127,1.9646,1.0362,2.0126,1.2476,3.4115,2.1524,0.0516,5.3355,0.8282,0.4852,0.0557,0.2085,1.0933,4.2461,2.1247,3.463,1.3839,2.1436,4.8839,0.7206,0.4886,0.0002,5.7076,1.0745,1.7618,2.3842,1.9838,3.6991,0.919,2.0232,1.7026,5.9566,2.819,4.2732,3.4286,2.1667,2.5253,5.2728,0.0108,3.7538,2.7205]}

She confirmed that President Vladimir Putin ordered the actions \"to suppress critical media coverage of the upcoming presidential elections in the coming months\"\n\nOne Russian official said that during the presidential campaign, the new laws were \"obviously part of an international effort.\"\n\nBut he added that Russia was \"very concerned that the Russian government has used the media to hurt its domestic market market in which the country supplies foreign media to third countries.\"","token_len":251,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.1102,1.1159,4.2443,1.8418,5.9745,2.8176,0.9971,0.5311,3.8157,4.5241,3.1813,10.1716,0.7427,3.0724,1.6642,2.4,1.5637,0.0056,1.3034,1.7898,6.9742,0.444,0.9358,0.0094,0.001,0.5749,2.2802,2.6237,1.8015,0.0647,0.776,1.437,2.4052,3.5214,0.4973,11.39,0.6551,3.1847,1.8031,1.5001,2.1251,1.259,0.7543,0.0037,0.4888,4.1943,4.3955,0.4471,0.7647,0.9525,3.0055,1.087,0.5094,0.0002,1.269,4.5487,3.0564,1.6689,4.9938,1.3628,1.873,1.1645,0.0118,1.0339,2.5827,4.6782,2.5711,4.045,1.4674,2.2831,0.9556,0.9888,3.0062,4.222,1.5566,2.1441,4.1759,1.7631,0.0001,4.6903,2.6171,2.6844,0.9372,3.4675,1.4201,1.0666,3.4786,2.5651,4.0321,2.9426,3.692,5.065,6.4696,3.2938,1.5015,3.8823,2.8711,0.5817,1.7342,5.2482,4.2514,4.5388,0.0508,0.8881,5.2899,0.0747,4.5093,1.3951,3.9591,1.6469,4.2087,2.2295,0.8342,5.8447,0.0071,8.5545,0.6658,1.7108,1.7381,0.0052,0.8507,5.8319,0.4087,2.1734,1.1879,2.3954,0.4045,0.8827,3.5062,2.2157,0.0141,0.0051,0.2301,3.9824,0.0872,0.6445,0.7097,0.2784,0.0002,3.8438,3.5386,0.0202,2.9457,0.0065,1.9698,0.11,1.0527,3.6778,0.9509,4.0947,4.0075,5.1362,4.7734,0.3953,4.6847,1.4644,4.0558,2.5316,2.5935,1.5058,2.6936,5.5637,1.2548,5.5426,0.5834,0.0284,3.9566,0.5862,4.8969,5.1252,1.6063,5.0484,3.1252,1.3661,2.8872,0.6353,0.8554,5.9855,2.374,1.0304,1.7522,1.5112,3.6348,1.2011,4.318,5.948,0.0002,5.5321,2.387,1.0482,1.3357,2.0481,5.3135,0.4592,3.8734,0.5264,0.9688,1.7749,5.3953,6.482,1.6879,2.5392,4.9861,0.9926,5.4378,0.014,2.0814,4.1256,1.3771,4.5336,0.5713,0.0002,4.385,3.5264,1.5036,0.444,2.422,2.0324,1.5985,3.3081,2.1597,2.2601,1.2344,3.0493,1.2848,2.268,3.1161,1.727,4.4958,0.735,4.8907,1.8525,3.9008,6.1012,5.8222,2.9604,5.754,2.1232,3.0341,5.922,4.7156,2.5262,2.3078,5.8568,1.3242,0.7189]}

The administration is also proposing that states ban importation of certain biofuels after 2020 and end the use of conventional fuels in the U.S. According to climate change experts, if these efforts were to succeed, new fossil fuel production could rise by 9 percent from 2005 levels. The letter states that if renewable fuels are used on American farms, then natural gas could replace electricity by 4.5 percent. If natural gas is not used on American farms, the letter shows, then a reduction in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions could mean a 50 percent jump in greenhouse gas emissions, according to the report by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental think tank.

The new order has drawn criticism from law enforcement officials who said the criminal charges against Manafort and Gates were part of a pattern of bribery and money laundering by Ukrainian officials and Russian officials.The Associated Press contributed to this report.","token_len":255,"entropy":[6.9563,0.6281,0.0806,0.0846,5.5359,0.9068,9.4358,4.2314,0.2016,9.1073,4.9384,3.1006,0.9715,6.9423,1.2852,0.0082,13.4167,6.6073,8.6867,3.5585,2.3027,0.6149,1.5007,0.0001,2.5933,0.7886,3.2114,1.0507,4.8897,0.0117,3.2131,1.7216,0.9793,1.8846,2.087,5.6899,2.6049,0.6183,3.9154,4.6479,3.7687,1.1815,5.3026,1.1099,0.4227,2.244,2.9587,6.2103,1.172,1.8019,4.0756,1.6248,0.6624,0.1212,0.5968,4.5042,3.6022,1.4149,3.8929,0.0083,0.0016,0.0107,2.127,0.0972,2.7487,2.4754,1.3001,5.5273,0.9598,0.96,1.3249,4.4225,2.112,1.6288,1.3687,1.6417,5.3142,0.3255,3.5197,2.1227,3.4464,0.1846,4.4964,3.7429,2.8617,0.0105,0.3766,5.9429,4.3546,0.0393,3.523,0.7014,3.4891,2.2025,2.1916,2.8302,2.4869,4.8838,0.8788,0.9973,0.714,0.5028,3.7444,3.1412,3.54,1.0841,0.0077,0.9939,3.8472,0.001,0.019,0.188,0.298,1.5488,3.5691,3.2662,0.216,2.3547,5.2455,4.1303,1.9618,2.3198,2.058,1.143,0.0026,4.5612,0.2387,0.0021,1.816,0.1599,1.7605,6.0258,4.9126,4.7637,4.8792,5.6912,4.7595,0.6205,2.6536,0.1739,3.473,4.0363,1.6966,4.6698,0.1451,3.6014,0.8484,0.7233,0.9521,4.2322,4.7687,4.7657,1.9002,1.4752,2.6308,3.7682,1.304,1.0977,1.011,1.2034,2.9181,1.08,5.6401,2.1404,1.5093,2.1644,4.7718,3.8683,1.2674,0.3274,3.1049,3.4317,5.0469,6.1269,7.8007,0.0304,0.1743,5.7022,1.0293,3.8745,3.2448,1.0874,1.3554,2.1987,2.9409,4.5527,1.9081,0.0319,1.3967,4.0397,3.605,3.9208,0.1032,1.1175,1.9953,3.4221,2.1319,1.5445,1.2433,1.8426,4.8033,4.2744,3.926,3.0224,1.6848,0.3275,3.5181,1.3414,1.0575,1.1424,3.4429,4.34,2.8768,4.1591,4.2169,1.4621,0.3681,5.0405,0.119,1.2186,1.4715,1.6775,1.558,5.4573,1.8402,1.361,0.1211,1.2731,0.0606,1.6845,4.4707,0.0042,0.5172,2.67,0.3195,5.7711,0.806,2.0947,0.1379,1.8505,5.1026,1.4613,2.5305,3.3644,1.6475,1.1195,2.0968,4.5877,0.0075,0.3149,0.0276,0.0021,0.0186,0.1105]}

[ MORE should seek congressional approval before the end of Congress' September recess.\n\n\"There's a lot of talk and it's going to happen in 2016,\" Ryan said.\n\nThe new tax plan is set to become standard for members and members of Congress on Sept. 19, when lawmakers return to work with the House Finance Committee. If confirmed by President Obama later this year, it would provide a $4 billion reduction to U.S. tax bills over the next decade, a tax change that would include a $1 billion cut to corporate taxes and increases to state and local tax rates. A separate elimination of corporate taxes would reduce their rates for all taxpayers by $200 million, offsetting a portion of the total.

Several thousand EU citizens have been arrested in the last five years in Warsaw since the communist regime seized power in 1991. In November 1989, President Gorbachev announced the imposition of new law in the Warsaw capital as part of a campaign to keep the communist regime from reinstating the dictatorship.\n\nThe European Union agreed to a landmark reform in March 1986 that would have imposed a special punishment for communist suspects guilty of crimes such as the murder of Polish journalists. The Polish government said the new law would have been implemented the following year; a former Warsaw TV channel ran a commercial to suggest it would be illegal to visit or publish an online video of a member of the Warsaw Central Committee. Despite being suspended in April 1988 and ordered to file for release in December 1995, its successor included new criminal penalties from 2005 and 2007.\n\nIn late 1997, Poland suspended its press freedom protection and the free speech provisions of the International Criminal Court. Since then, a series of scandals, including the murder of television host and television producer Olga Rios in 2008, have claimed the lives of about 575,000 citizens.","token_len":258,"entropy":[6.4617,9.0524,8.7933,4.9416,0.0299,4.4715,2.1768,2.1601,2.1159,4.9034,1.5796,3.1749,2.0696,0.3099,4.612,1.3427,6.2835,9.0483,8.5639,1.9784,6.727,5.2194,0.644,3.3754,5.8443,0.013,3.6888,0.0071,0.3801,1.1918,5.8556,0.119,0.0027,0.6827,9.7155,6.4443,3.0162,0.9498,1.6064,0.8277,1.9898,1.5015,1.0092,3.0318,2.9664,0.4296,1.8839,4.6917,2.3631,0.9915,4.4254,2.1528,3.3543,0.0644,0.4697,3.0895,0.3814,4.3964,4.3074,4.2626,0.1104,3.9819,4.8174,0.002,0.0001,3.5491,2.1946,4.5992,0.005,2.7883,3.6256,2.5717,1.6317,4.2312,2.644,3.7923,1.0479,0.0015,0.8575,3.7647,0.455,4.7525,0.9594,2.2303,0.7185,1.8306,5.5125,0.0737,0.0186,1.6826,4.6052,0.3288,1.5474,0.0003,2.0738,2.6435,1.7161,5.1646,0.7133,2.7915,5.2307,4.5559,1.9216,3.5898,4.7059,1.4921,2.7898,1.8362,3.2991,1.5794,5.0955,4.052,0.6456,4.2356,4.0567,5.3488,0.0255,1.0857,2.6407,0.0007,3.6004,1.6367,0.1139,2.023,3.0014,1.4578,1.4126,3.4844,0.8204,2.911,1.2823,1.3344,0.6443,0.8574,1.8765,2.5401,3.0534,5.902,1.2219,0.5687,6.7736,3.6343,5.2017,3.4281,6.1969,2.6058,4.4691,1.011,5.5169,4.542,5.0705,2.2466,1.5359,1.2655,4.0705,0.6131,4.8433,3.9423,4.0636,4.8068,4.2243,1.8414,1.2665,1.2964,4.9053,0.1995,0.3675,2.6896,5.3968,0.406,1.0694,6.2655,3.9816,5.1756,2.3299,3.233,3.1259,3.0299,4.7213,0.1875,6.1665,1.9018,2.3212,1.1489,2.8569,4.4163,0.0925,5.5386,4.2709,6.5418,5.1021,4.5079,1.426,6.0315,5.0113,3.3684,1.7656,0.3459,0.6653,0.0002,2.658,4.0354,4.7216,0.1408,2.4277,4.7111,1.3582,5.3535,0.3608,5.3338,3.0091,3.4724,4.4245,2.1492,3.5938,0.2627,0.5402,3.6445,0.5885,0.0586,1.9596,4.3272,0.2738,0.1858,3.7079,2.2297,0.0006,4.7486,2.8956,0.3579,0.7695,2.8804,0.067,6.3347,3.7038,3.2084,3.9637,2.0071,4.5375,0.3983,4.888,5.148,3.3052,4.3165,0.5936,0.3996,3.9723,1.3778,0.039,0.002,4.2353,3.4889,6.4034,2.0425,0.0201,3.8077,0.6946]}

The German chancellor, who was seen as having a strong relationship with the country's leader Angela Merkel, said that in the next couple of months, the UK would have to work out a deal. Speaking during an interview on Sunday with Austrian television, Merkel said: \"It is a very good chance for us to begin negotiations.\" If it succeeds, she said, she would be \"extremely encouraged by our new partnership\" with the EU.\n\nBrexit could have a very positive effect for the UK since it could lead with a strong German Chancellor, which is very important as it protects our economy and our people more than any other country has.

This may well allow for a \"deal\" which is not so bad for the UK and certainly a few who are already concerned about how Brexit would affect their family life.","token_len":259,"entropy":[9.8851,1.7617,0.0003,2.9044,1.5913,2.0091,2.3124,4.6555,3.1564,0.6571,1.4192,4.9736,0.2267,1.2956,1.4646,5.7475,4.9025,0.1349,3.0157,1.7324,1.0569,2.9815,4.7425,13.9431,2.9367,0.3932,2.0967,8.6413,0.8597,5.3962,2.4799,8.9587,0.0003,2.3558,1.2738,1.9837,3.8139,2.1376,1.3896,4.2996,0.9434,4.1734,2.8483,4.9951,1.7039,0.372,1.0745,3.2643,3.2766,1.1051,2.6532,0.594,2.2813,4.1031,0.3007,3.1071,1.9558,1.7765,3.4041,0.0057,1.1142,5.1181,0.5661,2.9525,3.8175,0.001,0.1646,0.906,2.8922,4.7399,1.0153,2.6602,2.9903,0.0153,1.2195,1.7891,1.8468,2.0033,1.3936,1.687,0.3407,3.955,0.9149,1.1175,1.3389,2.8523,4.9591,4.0759,1.7877,0.634,1.8227,4.8269,2.3349,4.9024,2.5357,0.3475,1.4816,0.4458,1.6868,0.1015,2.7702,1.1613,2.3442,1.7034,2.8211,2.2792,2.0808,0.9423,0.8504,3.4072,1.079,2.2763,5.9136,3.1275,4.8615,0.6277,1.174,0.3771,0.2935,3.1888,0.3625,2.2401,2.2003,3.458,5.6463,2.8964,3.9376,4.3667,4.6828,2.0402,0.3323,0.3283,0.5983,0.6453,1.5136,0.0012,4.5125,3.5198,3.3047,1.3047,4.1156,2.6336,1.2552,2.1939,1.2943,0.77,6.0296,0.8696,1.6926,4.0145,8.1072,2.0718,3.1321,4.7944,3.5749,2.3365,4.0154,2.1429,3.4255,0.806,3.4333,2.2461,6.4415,3.509,2.9946,1.0086,1.7898,3.0771,6.3501,0.7066,1.9617,0.2767,2.0872,4.7576,0.9935,2.785,1.9374,2.1676,3.9201,0.5534,2.8244,2.4873,2.6008,2.8385,1.5868,4.9318,2.7099,0.0017,5.3472,0.7995,0.8002,5.5556,2.4441,2.0809,2.1337,4.8513,5.9169,2.3665,0.9394,0.1369,5.803,5.2613,1.8802,1.6776,1.4896,1.0648,2.4644,1.6767,4.5285,4.2417,1.3427,0.9685,3.8052,2.5456,1.0132,1.5669,4.9971,3.5371,0.4068,0.7341,0.9642,0.2513,0.1209,0.2856,3.9451,3.669,2.9801,6.0978,1.8304,1.1044,4.2804,5.1491,0.9158,3.0828,1.9579,2.142,3.1736,1.8514,1.1622,0.4906,0.375,2.625,5.4529,4.0551,5.4088,5.6199,2.0999,3.0472,4.0904,0.4657,3.3337,2.6991,2.5347,0.4005,1.0378,4.8422,1.8593,0.7004]}

The BJP had expected him to take a big step forward as the party, with its majority in Uttar Pradesh and north-western Bihar, failed to retain his seat in 2014.\n\nThe Congress, the main opposition in the state and the country's largest party, have already set a target of bringing down the Congress in 2019 when Modi becomes prime minister.","token_len":260,"entropy":[8.9601,0.0214,0.3058,0.0013,3.8005,3.2338,2.1044,5.7038,4.1367,0.0492,5.394,2.508,3.6906,2.5088,7.626,2.7768,0.8141,2.794,1.7429,0.0645,3.6173,7.6745,0.683,0.0036,1.5717,6.2732,1.9831,1.9753,5.7958,2.0486,2.8907,9.8221,1.5323,4.0576,3.5175,1.691,3.4556,2.5703,5.1329,1.126,3.1679,1.5271,1.5888,5.8958,3.0206,0.8868,0.9042,2.2366,2.4474,1.7411,0.0218,0.5947,2.7921,5.6361,4.6056,0.0025,0.1041,1.6745,6.2207,2.0325,3.3395,5.3096,3.1037,0.7122,2.7119,0.3651,0.8991,0.0002,5.696,5.2862,4.1302,0.0026,0.5202,0.0012,3.1985,1.5802,0.0529,1.8823,3.6319,3.717,1.1916,2.8226,0.2572,0.0,0.0007,6.2692,0.6097,0.4949,5.9261,2.2984,3.4412,4.6106,3.7901,3.1829,0.9223,0.9347,4.8923,0.7879,5.0003,2.6721,2.604,0.0003,3.1549,0.0174,0.0827,0.0007,4.672,1.2061,2.7761,1.965,3.8551,1.3364,4.4259,4.211,0.3429,4.767,2.5968,0.4512,5.1039,0.0046,1.2551,6.9686,0.0448,0.066,1.7073,0.8505,3.2159,5.2289,3.255,2.0783,4.6763,1.9227,2.2198,4.476,0.5387,0.779,1.4642,5.0809,2.2684,1.2552,1.1232,0.0002,5.213,4.7638,0.6031,2.2921,0.1308,1.393,5.3207,0.3884,1.7408,2.9067,0.2813,2.1576,4.207,2.6392,4.659,6.148,0.2754,2.8811,3.2109,3.998,0.213,4.2668,0.3067,2.4689,4.3744,1.8063,3.4352,6.1394,5.4079,1.0522,0.822,1.1812,6.9178,0.6494,0.3273,0.0001,5.2048,4.0191,6.6963,2.08,6.108,0.8159,4.959,0.3132,0.9832,1.2554,2.2151,1.3924,2.6238,5.1254,1.8909,0.0439,3.0977,1.5591,4.4476,0.9548,1.8734,3.1703,1.5271,1.8045,5.1731,3.5748,1.7197,4.8938,0.7499,4.9559,0.0002,1.2514,5.7156,1.3316,2.4207,3.7938,0.101,4.5681,0.0904,5.2175,5.1673,1.4115,0.8435,3.9339,0.4386,0.4622,0.0001,1.9853,1.9882,2.2312,3.4241,2.4216,0.397,1.7086,0.7343,0.1849,3.3335,1.4717,4.0369,0.6572,1.328,0.7367,0.2092,4.0189,4.9141,5.1536,2.544,1.2003,0.365,4.3946,2.5096,0.8303,2.1115,2.6448,2.5934,5.6547,3.009,3.1726,0.7237,0.0019,0.1936]}

Most of the law in which Botswana was declared part of the international community, however, is limited to transgender people, although it is not enforced.","token_len":260,"entropy":[11.0122,1.2672,2.9833,4.0943,0.9221,3.1086,0.7733,1.3972,12.7697,0.0198,10.7754,3.8636,3.284,3.7981,4.9895,0.3141,4.3636,2.2295,2.3641,3.7153,5.7867,0.993,1.9162,1.8218,0.0889,3.0492,2.8035,0.0921,0.0084,2.263,4.6976,0.2868,0.2935,5.438,7.9652,2.0916,1.6626,1.4962,3.4705,0.4722,0.6435,0.0003,3.0515,0.9326,3.4144,1.0175,1.5852,5.1273,0.0635,5.9942,2.1063,1.5679,2.3735,5.8037,6.4749,0.0024,1.9876,4.4145,3.9604,4.8342,0.554,0.8116,0.0003,5.3641,4.6074,0.2213,6.2515,0.9077,5.032,0.4055,0.9739,4.1389,5.8989,5.6728,2.5367,0.3259,2.567,3.0423,2.8411,0.0626,3.9636,3.5165,0.9593,0.9557,3.7613,1.1624,1.2588,2.1756,1.433,2.0903,1.0697,0.0864,3.8077,1.031,1.2112,0.7072,2.2822,1.4416,4.1369,2.6926,1.6166,0.0061,3.8495,1.0627,3.423,4.4627,2.2137,5.4501,0.5361,4.9194,6.5689,2.6624,3.8617,1.4759,2.5078,4.5215,6.1518,1.1619,3.1928,0.7977,0.0267,5.2006,1.5931,2.0377,4.4366,2.6125,0.871,0.1511,0.0003,4.9245,1.1827,0.4227,6.4514,0.7051,6.7118,5.1947,3.5904,4.72,4.2925,5.5848,3.4113,0.6466,0.0005,3.0896,3.4844,1.369,2.1093,0.0223,4.006,5.1176,5.5426,0.8456,0.6858,0.5979,5.04,1.5206,0.4899,2.4806,2.9052,0.8967,0.3985,2.0338,4.3089,2.1607,1.0814,5.3374,2.9391,2.5696,4.5566,1.9325,4.4647,1.0662,1.526,7.6549,1.4648,5.5067,2.4362,3.8513,0.373,4.0444,0.7755,4.3683,1.0636,4.2634,0.0598,1.1319,0.2409,0.7144,1.5693,2.9064,1.244,1.4587,4.3263,0.0919,1.3568,4.5482,1.9793,0.5145,5.9902,0.731,1.7841,0.2391,0.0003,1.9987,5.0652,1.7557,3.3105,3.1867,3.4667,3.3289,1.412,1.4076,1.6069,0.0008,0.2688,2.4152,1.5711,0.2703,2.0096,0.0405,2.2405,5.2145,0.0026,0.0003,0.7109,3.9169,0.7984,3.9189,1.0815,6.1579,1.517,0.4393,5.3024,3.2278,5.3467,2.8224,0.0012,2.655,4.1697,4.6492,0.0078,0.1169,3.2028,1.064,2.9236,3.8261,0.0129,2.435,5.2965,0.1438,3.3858,0.2495,1.4898,4.3505,1.586,2.1145,2.8149,5.1022,0.84]}

EU leaders said in a joint statement that the referendum was \"unnecessary\" and set a \"very strong precedent\" for how they would deal with Britain leaving the EU.","token_len":261,"entropy":[9.5314,8.8222,8.472,0.0025,3.863,0.0013,11.4827,5.7308,2.2869,2.1198,1.2611,4.8409,1.13,5.7805,2.6334,3.2885,7.3579,3.6845,1.0863,2.8575,3.0782,1.5733,5.723,2.4344,2.2711,0.0431,9.4571,1.3783,0.0374,0.8823,1.5583,0.0631,0.3289,4.1063,5.9191,1.8707,2.0832,2.3702,2.8141,4.2693,0.7988,4.421,3.3978,0.4177,0.2815,0.0003,1.547,4.7675,2.9462,1.7576,3.73,4.7029,3.8521,3.492,1.3042,1.1884,3.8886,2.3608,4.1344,0.8994,1.2934,2.2286,0.0776,0.0121,0.4093,1.5528,1.4484,0.0002,1.7751,3.8683,3.2093,1.082,1.9262,2.2258,3.1632,5.6238,3.6825,1.4552,5.3512,1.2216,3.6768,0.1819,3.5574,5.6947,0.4839,1.6547,1.2055,3.2645,6.24,1.2549,4.4911,4.23,3.4029,2.2052,3.7594,4.0039,1.6889,4.115,6.1141,1.8613,0.6952,2.9823,2.273,1.4113,2.1946,0.804,1.9267,0.6577,0.2181,0.0002,4.8572,1.0835,3.0889,2.9419,3.0328,1.1742,0.9108,3.6236,1.5934,3.098,0.4571,2.3091,2.5498,3.4101,4.0581,2.0579,3.6948,2.6304,1.1256,6.3667,1.2058,3.1281,3.8816,2.9836,0.7134,0.5094,2.1196,3.6164,3.2562,3.5123,0.0037,5.8997,0.3706,1.6424,1.247,1.9033,2.4087,4.0937,4.6462,2.047,1.2994,0.1077,3.2192,1.1475,4.4391,1.4173,5.0965,0.517,3.5243,7.4272,2.7265,0.109,0.0002,3.5952,1.2606,4.9452,1.9159,2.1959,0.4358,1.6407,1.5084,3.4605,2.0422,4.3903,5.2278,0.0271,0.4919,3.3595,2.0357,0.2212,3.3075,0.6688,3.1801,3.458,0.5514,2.8652,3.32,0.8597,2.1801,6.2891,2.6196,3.126,0.8159,0.1288,5.4479,1.0444,1.7321,0.2452,0.8902,0.2709,0.0002,4.7352,0.8108,5.2088,5.9715,1.4859,0.2467,3.1678,0.6115,3.1593,3.991,6.1293,0.9265,1.2724,4.4904,0.6126,0.2013,2.2314,8.8294,4.0816,1.6042,0.016,0.0027,1.4753,1.4134,1.0416,4.5867,0.7758,1.7669,4.5888,0.3001,1.3952,0.0556,0.7574,1.4771,1.966,2.0052,1.521,3.3742,2.2539,1.2828,0.3796,6.1964,1.4299,1.635,2.7953,3.7213,1.3884,0.9493,0.6598,3.8694,2.3529,0.8297,2.4544,0.0119,2.7375,2.5078,0.1552,0.8243,0.1946]}

There will be no changes to the EU rules concerning what will be left of trade and there will be no tariffs on exports to the EU, so there is no need for any tariffs,\" he said, adding: \"It would be sensible and logical for the British to abide by the agreements of the UK, the EU and the EU members to remain in the EU.\"","token_len":261,"entropy":[10.3505,8.4543,0.8463,6.2931,2.0594,3.575,0.0028,1.2739,2.2985,1.1447,1.272,2.2471,5.1631,5.4174,0.0484,2.673,2.397,4.0462,4.7438,0.0047,1.1286,5.6124,4.0739,1.7352,0.2161,10.5603,3.0143,14.9685,9.3228,5.4982,2.7606,4.7222,3.5926,5.1181,0.1922,0.5113,6.9992,1.2647,4.317,3.2158,2.1769,3.1158,1.3945,4.9152,0.5999,3.7683,0.0463,5.0973,2.2294,1.1239,1.7721,0.0038,6.2778,1.6184,2.2068,0.6702,3.184,1.0838,2.48,3.3444,0.0529,3.2531,0.5258,1.0061,0.4662,3.5774,0.0007,5.0517,5.325,4.7792,1.0467,2.159,2.4986,2.9444,4.0484,3.1287,0.9633,2.5857,2.4612,3.9549,3.9333,0.2269,4.2023,6.3891,2.0565,0.0722,1.1318,0.0028,5.6742,2.3164,0.8093,0.7755,4.4273,1.8491,4.8246,2.5508,5.4419,4.2044,5.4501,3.0267,2.0214,1.544,2.271,2.2236,0.4123,2.3282,4.3197,3.2314,0.0343,1.3662,0.5784,0.28,5.0498,4.3585,0.1464,5.0897,0.0111,2.212,0.0003,1.881,0.4533,0.0653,0.5882,2.5156,1.0417,2.532,3.7436,3.8628,2.1253,5.3873,3.0247,4.0003,2.5232,1.9582,4.3777,2.268,3.0595,1.7432,4.1676,1.1111,2.8985,3.7018,0.6352,2.4089,5.4092,2.3488,2.7281,1.0972,0.0448,0.2944,1.0058,0.0002,2.5804,1.8234,1.7951,3.6463,4.3055,4.0253,1.72,2.3466,4.2844,1.6465,5.9337,0.6085,3.5065,1.0003,4.4021,1.3231,5.4739,0.4135,2.5334,1.8932,3.0077,0.0963,0.8239,0.0007,1.9709,5.448,0.1588,1.1566,0.0444,6.1753,2.9009,3.5429,6.0314,1.549,3.2516,4.1313,1.8272,0.2089,0.3181,3.9118,0.409,0.9794,2.8635,2.0545,5.3308,5.4739,4.9045,1.1725,5.5448,0.6714,3.9743,2.5409,4.2188,0.2937,0.163,0.1186,3.562,1.1325,3.4941,2.1069,0.5486,0.9332,2.7675,3.2198,1.7447,0.9871,0.2565,1.3956,0.6576,1.4205,2.6599,1.7367,1.9483,0.2432,3.6511,1.1191,1.5232,0.0134,3.1368,3.1573,0.5232,5.2675,2.5875,4.4726,0.9599,0.9422,2.3652,2.8181,5.3869,0.0146,0.8204,4.5302,3.7704,0.5769,3.1613,2.1003,1.7102,0.4541,0.3499,0.4601,1.5796,5.1179,3.0417,3.3689,1.1833,0.3673,2.1842,1.8361]}

Many have suggested that the government should make a formal decision to end the vote, a move that could change the situation in Catalonia.\n\nSpain was once among the world's leading and most influential democracies before losing its independence referendum on June 17, 1992.

Spanish constitutional observers from around the world will be present at the election, with the presidency, parliament and local authorities.","token_len":261,"entropy":[8.2591,2.8243,6.0086,2.7162,7.7948,1.273,10.3925,0.1202,3.4931,2.502,3.2051,1.0367,3.3675,4.0824,2.8751,6.5279,2.8416,1.5099,1.2539,1.2606,2.4023,8.4226,11.2891,7.0357,0.7735,6.4994,0.0709,4.3785,1.4741,2.307,3.3482,2.1272,0.33,3.4106,6.0984,3.104,2.8421,0.9692,2.2378,2.8252,5.6111,3.2791,0.9259,4.3076,3.1717,3.335,0.1783,2.8694,2.5647,1.6496,1.4992,1.5686,4.0265,1.4166,6.167,0.7659,1.3239,3.5956,1.4633,6.8814,4.6413,2.9755,0.6952,1.3428,3.5518,1.9799,4.692,1.4697,2.9913,3.3027,2.6422,3.7056,0.5294,2.8816,1.8343,3.9806,1.1792,0.4063,1.0579,5.3685,0.3177,4.1891,1.2849,0.6984,0.751,0.4702,0.0003,3.6851,5.7603,4.123,4.5219,0.2065,1.9105,0.1096,2.2536,4.991,0.5162,2.5799,1.3358,3.3176,5.2571,0.7488,0.5025,3.6379,3.4294,1.6163,2.2215,0.7045,4.0695,0.3233,2.8308,4.1089,1.4907,3.3523,0.4274,5.2245,0.4409,1.9127,0.6844,3.6195,1.2313,2.4398,5.1369,3.6106,1.8852,3.2043,0.8177,1.6895,1.7257,5.6322,2.1726,0.1472,1.5699,2.1291,2.7352,3.4076,4.6688,5.2118,4.8822,1.011,2.287,2.2146,3.6306,0.1462,2.7435,3.3274,0.6785,5.1445,0.7591,4.9155,3.446,2.6889,2.0561,0.5827,0.9484,4.0791,1.4777,0.0577,2.3579,2.2919,0.9491,5.1836,0.6321,4.7189,3.9059,1.1645,5.5259,1.6475,3.2074,3.321,0.4667,2.458,5.3197,1.3251,1.8201,1.3461,2.4249,1.9641,0.2432,4.6104,1.8187,0.7851,2.0216,0.1428,0.3658,1.9758,0.1865,2.0522,0.7644,3.8396,5.5281,2.0983,3.3589,5.3418,0.9498,0.2708,2.3668,3.7975,1.5039,2.3055,2.0703,3.975,2.3303,0.9303,2.9071,6.1208,1.2765,0.7238,2.5519,0.8018,2.5329,2.2884,2.1347,2.4878,3.3012,5.1767,2.7619,2.1601,6.205,2.7769,0.2557,4.2131,2.6922,1.2285,2.5624,1.1716,1.1726,1.2152,1.4651,0.5344,5.4861,5.122,1.2369,5.755,1.5112,2.0976,1.0115,5.9137,4.1887,5.9604,4.8752,1.9602,0.0553,0.0946,1.2542,1.6626,1.8634,1.0903,0.1812,2.2105,1.1989,2.9894,1.7102,5.2682,3.1612,1.9847,0.2494,4.6594,1.9851,2.7061]}

He also said he wants to see a second confirmation process for Mueller before giving Trump the chance to appoint others.\n\nHe said he expected Senate Democrats to be more cooperative than Republicans with questions about potential obstruction of their probe, because they would like to see a \"very, very thorough\" investigation.\n\nIn any event, Sekulow said he was still planning to ask Trump to consider his request to have Mueller fired as part of an investigation, but he said Democrats would want to know and hear from what they could think of, and not just a \"small minority\" of Democrats on the committee.\n\n\"This committee has a good chance to hold down a filibuster of a nominee when it suits the Democrats and some Democrats just don't know what they can think of,\" he said.","token_len":261,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,4.8571,3.3582,7.2973,0.8323,1.0526,2.7591,4.2218,6.1573,0.028,4.0074,0.0306,0.0432,0.0412,3.3073,8.9703,0.0425,6.405,2.8729,3.5702,0.2798,0.2399,0.9496,4.1598,6.2281,4.683,0.0022,0.001,0.0001,0.7916,1.7582,2.2147,5.4709,1.6137,2.4828,2.2046,4.8288,3.1542,0.8226,1.8826,3.5778,0.8798,0.5976,4.5501,0.3234,6.3461,3.9058,0.0016,2.083,0.0,0.0149,1.0577,0.0082,0.0608,0.0791,0.3979,0.9962,1.7726,1.8758,5.1586,2.9406,4.0313,3.7506,5.4089,0.8591,4.372,0.0129,0.6166,2.2378,5.0125,1.2558,1.5651,4.31,0.4226,1.8592,2.026,2.3667,2.7517,3.9522,1.3677,3.9363,2.8984,3.0466,2.0085,0.9275,0.688,3.6775,1.0094,3.6259,0.6777,5.3484,4.6407,3.4501,0.2572,0.6305,4.5584,1.9788,0.6639,1.2656,4.0783,0.6777,1.8456,2.6112,5.0563,2.3154,2.0466,2.3452,2.6455,2.1871,6.404,4.0905,1.8884,1.7165,0.0562,3.017,3.8662,1.0241,0.5716,0.0003,5.3096,1.1705,1.3888,4.905,4.9125,1.4977,0.4654,3.2624,2.5309,4.8802,2.9522,0.9415,3.7992,5.9963,0.4271,4.9843,2.007,0.4687,5.6223,2.7496,1.6759,4.6818,1.4584,2.5107,4.0986,0.5188,0.705,2.0691,3.3469,3.7304,2.3037,0.0075,2.6779,1.0748,1.1407,1.4808,0.4405,0.0002,4.2419,6.025,1.2936,0.0089,2.8077,0.0004,0.0005,0.4443,1.2195,2.5371,4.442,5.5043,0.5431,3.2354,2.6574,1.3922,3.9905,2.8288,3.7901,1.6335,3.6095,1.6414,2.0404,3.4539,2.3028,0.002,2.7644,1.6804,3.5278,1.505,1.6734,1.4402,5.7858,1.8513,3.7246,0.4434,2.4148,6.7615,2.732,1.3676,5.4077,2.047,3.4234,4.1101,0.138,4.5083,2.0124,2.2667,0.9322,3.9248,3.2317,4.5994,3.2345,0.9633,0.2928,1.5487,3.6774,0.7693,1.4872,0.3489,0.2399,0.0002,0.9335,3.8929,3.6558,1.712,2.0678,5.0214,1.9569,0.7704,4.2633,5.2204,2.2158,5.6504,2.5089,2.3979,2.6251,4.5623,1.7842,6.0351,1.607,4.8051,2.2777,5.6463,2.5396,5.1251,1.2901,0.0007,3.0275,0.7748,1.0055,3.8292,2.052,0.1851,0.8573,1.2641,0.0898,0.1104]}

As part of their plea agreement, authorities also agreed to show they would be fair treatment during the trial, which concluded in late April, the men said.\n\nLawyers for three of the defendants in the case, however, say they have not yet met with any of their representatives.","token_len":262,"entropy":[9.1932,0.0208,9.9748,7.4471,5.3528,6.6565,2.4933,0.3955,5.4647,1.8071,0.3035,1.643,3.8156,2.9576,1.8281,1.0617,0.0302,0.1076,2.3995,4.6751,2.547,3.435,6.001,3.8276,1.2128,4.8653,1.642,4.3533,0.059,2.7334,5.3274,0.0006,3.7722,0.1957,0.0572,1.1148,5.1952,4.3793,1.2985,6.3561,2.3069,4.8576,4.5554,0.7544,6.1007,0.1288,5.5291,0.2873,6.4896,5.5792,1.8499,3.636,3.8322,2.5117,2.4132,0.1041,0.5988,4.2591,0.0008,0.0025,0.0425,4.0883,2.4737,2.964,2.2955,6.9838,0.5595,1.9035,0.0799,0.421,0.0003,5.5652,0.1757,2.503,0.9366,4.8441,1.3277,2.1472,1.5635,1.8764,1.9481,3.0116,0.7467,0.075,4.0773,1.9383,3.74,1.2318,4.8586,5.6245,2.0985,1.0053,0.7471,4.8691,1.9597,1.3655,3.3782,0.6785,2.7702,3.2463,3.3037,5.3894,5.8652,0.0052,5.5917,1.4414,4.2612,0.8146,1.832,2.3126,4.9111,3.4061,4.9089,1.3395,2.3442,2.6934,0.0007,4.6363,1.8274,4.1379,0.8065,1.4006,0.0213,0.4171,0.3609,0.0002,1.5645,2.8173,1.6723,3.1696,5.7441,1.2866,4.8547,3.8448,0.6042,4.8001,2.0405,2.6632,2.3585,0.1455,5.5103,2.6364,2.5436,1.6587,0.3169,1.2817,4.5735,0.3618,4.6863,2.8115,5.5659,0.3279,0.746,4.5616,1.9537,4.1994,0.0011,5.7976,2.9063,0.6099,0.7232,0.0002,4.8502,1.1107,1.4021,1.2078,1.4159,1.9621,0.6215,1.5467,4.253,0.7633,0.8232,3.2367,3.4233,3.1175,1.3515,0.8904,3.0492,0.8922,0.8653,1.2188,2.6013,0.5602,3.0422,1.8058,2.6876,0.5004,3.5476,3.225,0.0013,0.0026,0.0135,1.9694,2.1581,0.8246,3.4018,1.6611,5.4694,2.5537,2.6095,0.0142,1.2681,6.7805,2.3491,0.0027,1.8026,1.555,0.989,0.3012,6.0298,2.8397,0.8962,0.2318,4.7576,1.1034,0.6796,0.6817,1.0431,0.298,6.3704,2.0389,0.4003,1.472,1.8935,6.4594,1.5901,3.5391,2.5909,2.7755,2.7456,2.5991,0.9522,0.2112,0.1686,0.0002,4.2609,0.0543,0.5842,5.5067,0.6106,0.0802,0.9329,2.9455,0.1233,0.2592,1.0901,5.664,0.0017,2.9053,1.0102,2.1062,1.5406,1.2646,3.8148,0.4359,2.5065,0.6086,2.7004,3.6847,1.3581]}

Authorities are currently questioning one of Sherman's employees to find out if Sherman was murdered by a suicide because he allegedly was drunk and would have let his body be shipped to Brazil.Sherman's death prompted a backlash from the pharmaceutical industry on Friday, with the Canadian Pharmacists Association of Canada condemning his suicides and demanding the case reopened. The pharmacy association and the National Alliance for Safe Access said they were reviewing Sherman's suicide and his refusal to pay his medical debt. The government said the pharmacist was arrested in Canada this week and he refused to pay out of fear for his job.Sherman's suicide also sparked protests in Saskatchewan, where residents are demanding answers after what appears to be a cover-up.Police in Saskatoon said some of the pharmacy workers are \"actively searching\" to find out what happened and are also looking for other drug producers, and there's a suggestion some of them might have been involved in some of the murder-suicide incidents. Shermin A. Sherman was also a director of a pharmaceutical manufacturing company for some of the company's operations based in the city of Vancouver when he was reportedly killed.","token_len":262,"entropy":[7.1195,3.08,3.3028,1.5119,6.0745,2.896,0.1731,14.5967,3.4302,6.5682,6.4029,7.7751,1.5716,5.0388,0.1626,7.6281,2.8281,0.0565,2.9331,2.6645,1.0054,1.14,0.674,9.3566,2.6432,3.7833,3.3799,0.2793,0.3238,1.0371,2.6141,5.0212,4.7461,1.7099,2.8613,0.3644,6.2597,1.9301,4.5443,4.7509,4.742,0.351,1.9155,0.0044,3.396,5.0318,2.9693,0.0789,1.4845,3.5127,1.6597,2.3188,3.2378,1.8747,3.8525,6.926,1.178,3.3609,3.6317,3.9222,1.8333,4.9469,1.5955,4.8986,1.1043,3.9952,1.6273,3.1812,0.8524,5.9246,0.829,6.2076,0.0033,1.6176,1.8222,4.2931,1.5745,3.8938,0.9975,2.3356,0.8411,0.1988,4.8112,1.5445,0.9518,1.0194,2.6288,1.8774,4.52,0.1595,0.0969,6.0775,0.153,3.7339,3.1033,6.8318,1.6578,3.0108,2.4585,5.3864,5.5015,0.1726,2.8103,6.1267,0.538,4.474,1.483,3.4619,4.7421,1.2267,2.3336,0.8674,2.0086,1.1278,1.7179,4.9012,2.3473,0.0244,3.2194,1.7286,4.2405,5.5327,0.0232,3.5641,2.7419,1.5026,5.3569,0.9053,3.008,4.8935,2.437,2.2231,5.5765,0.6748,1.9547,4.0729,1.5994,3.8401,4.6034,0.8153,1.5158,4.8702,4.563,0.0959,0.5554,5.2756,1.1365,2.7186,2.4966,0.0767,3.7271,0.8461,2.0585,0.0038,1.3415,3.3648,3.7235,1.8513,2.6549,1.5088,5.9036,0.7696,0.8745,5.3814,2.7368,1.1495,3.5239,3.312,6.204,4.4894,0.0047,0.2038,0.7234,3.6609,0.2354,0.0022,1.4559,4.9223,2.3939,2.3171,0.0051,1.26,6.1454,0.9197,0.4364,5.5392,1.2799,4.0581,3.9214,5.4043,2.4547,1.6465,3.0085,0.976,0.3456,1.3634,0.5241,2.6879,2.3262,2.6713,1.8185,0.6447,2.5808,3.4345,5.597,2.5006,3.5768,4.2911,2.4937,1.9429,5.7172,3.3099,1.0913,1.1814,2.8628,0.7172,0.96,1.0184,0.2647,4.1762,0.8191,0.3365,4.9369,2.935,0.0331,0.4014,4.0495,0.649,3.947,4.9627,5.0765,1.2985,0.279,2.3784,4.3323,2.4141,3.5602,0.5398,2.3525,2.2186,4.0453,0.347,3.9992,5.5467,0.4524,0.5953,2.1532,0.0148,5.1687,6.6565,0.1771,2.757,2.717,0.9903,3.737,3.9467,0.6341,1.0894,5.5836,1.2411,1.1017]}

He left his post early in the week following the presidential election, prompting speculation that he may seek the resignation of his predecessor in favor of younger candidates.\n\nCongressional Republicans on Thursday said they would push for a deal to open the country up to American workers from abroad but there was no immediate comment.","token_len":263,"entropy":[6.9248,0.1746,6.9187,2.142,1.9415,0.856,2.1195,6.9992,12.9253,4.6659,6.7769,5.7988,9.1773,10.173,0.6555,1.3589,2.656,3.8427,0.6854,3.6569,8.1843,4.5791,6.6305,3.8992,1.2695,5.3821,0.4008,0.4823,0.0029,1.3621,1.8844,2.5366,6.7261,0.0311,4.2176,0.7236,3.787,1.8827,1.6284,0.7361,2.3259,5.2704,0.1377,0.239,0.1641,0.0003,1.9251,0.0056,0.0025,0.73,5.4465,0.0027,5.4603,1.3898,3.857,0.1626,0.6775,6.9825,0.0151,6.4031,0.9127,2.1951,0.809,0.315,0.0033,0.0003,1.4118,2.4201,3.1406,4.2699,0.1443,0.2824,1.8112,4.6448,3.2984,0.7627,3.9542,1.8046,3.786,0.4516,3.6154,0.3799,1.2169,2.0939,1.0431,3.7967,3.0731,0.3909,2.32,4.7166,6.4883,0.0431,2.205,1.8571,1.4281,5.2151,3.8833,2.5649,4.5439,2.0565,0.1826,0.3336,3.7842,0.5204,1.0977,0.1653,3.21,2.3352,3.5013,0.2788,1.6467,2.3901,0.9659,5.0542,2.701,0.354,0.7596,0.9571,0.1329,0.0002,3.3628,0.0025,0.0125,3.9306,0.8258,0.0243,0.496,4.1934,5.9595,4.0518,1.6871,2.4507,0.0005,0.0134,0.4694,4.1371,1.7867,5.6073,2.3697,2.1071,1.0504,1.5801,2.8671,1.8554,4.5247,0.0288,4.6942,1.9074,1.3739,4.9909,4.2745,4.8347,0.2826,0.0457,1.2325,0.406,0.3939,0.9316,1.3998,0.5902,0.0002,2.5729,0.0126,0.0044,6.0679,1.643,4.7095,4.4865,0.5581,4.8793,0.9554,0.882,2.0415,2.2259,0.4663,1.7201,2.7877,2.1695,0.0003,0.0025,0.0663,5.6695,7.5693,0.1754,5.5398,2.2916,0.0008,0.007,0.1163,1.1168,2.4747,5.4348,1.191,5.1774,0.8451,3.1015,5.6305,0.7064,4.8488,2.5632,0.8293,2.7234,6.1804,2.9728,0.7143,5.0864,2.3758,0.6201,3.0025,3.7211,1.5976,4.4613,0.4115,1.5348,3.9119,2.9821,0.611,0.5332,2.0146,3.567,2.6532,3.9984,0.1309,1.7633,2.0524,3.9484,4.3763,0.0013,5.0079,2.4166,0.4809,0.1489,0.0002,5.3526,1.934,1.6741,2.8994,0.7732,2.9199,0.4823,1.2709,4.4274,0.3772,1.2397,5.7246,1.4384,5.4908,1.2982,4.1925,1.6226,0.1564,2.7689,4.1407,3.9858,2.8411,4.2334,4.8257,1.2614,0.6098,2.3947,3.7443,1.4658]}

And, the party's establishment leaders will have some of the key levers of power in their hands, as they try to maintain a solid majority in their conference and push some new party platforms like the one they have been negotiating with Republicans (among other things) on.","token_len":263,"entropy":[12.7383,3.3607,4.5477,9.6747,3.555,2.9269,2.249,2.3436,6.0315,1.2437,9.5654,16.7426,9.1645,8.8444,8.761,5.1034,2.9623,4.6121,3.0657,0.0938,2.2736,0.7032,2.4479,5.7248,0.003,6.3265,2.2399,5.4385,0.3185,3.2406,4.704,5.6507,0.86,2.7224,0.8966,3.2801,2.7524,1.2558,1.8176,3.7133,2.6425,2.6997,4.3469,5.5193,3.0832,0.0742,0.9386,5.1846,4.525,0.3655,0.7319,2.3501,0.0007,2.4363,5.2546,2.2317,4.0215,4.538,0.0123,3.1783,1.3458,4.3844,4.4332,3.2407,6.6643,0.2071,3.8018,0.9642,2.4214,0.0003,4.3624,4.5121,1.6896,3.4294,0.3179,3.78,2.9106,0.3439,1.4646,3.8313,1.6495,2.3609,1.9596,5.0549,2.8168,1.8122,0.0002,4.2982,0.0466,0.836,0.0018,1.0595,0.0555,2.7845,0.102,0.0,0.2631,3.5467,1.6926,2.074,0.9421,4.3826,1.5637,3.9168,2.6493,2.9974,1.4811,0.0072,6.492,5.1393,0.2168,2.6822,1.1152,2.5301,2.7696,3.4127,0.0004,0.0012,0.0008,0.9042,2.9465,0.2994,1.8751,3.5703,2.6673,3.8304,0.7979,4.216,0.0749,0.0614,0.006,0.3398,0.9073,0.0002,5.0805,0.9452,1.066,0.0183,0.061,3.4231,0.0719,3.8879,6.1089,3.5603,2.7952,0.2609,6.1439,5.4013,2.8709,0.4243,1.3144,0.6969,0.0002,3.0293,2.6983,4.631,5.1592,0.2278,3.4118,2.5228,5.1278,2.049,5.5892,3.8117,5.4351,0.26,4.4978,0.4787,2.5673,0.8515,4.6867,4.6577,4.5375,0.247,3.0314,0.8176,1.1912,4.1399,0.9297,2.3908,1.7768,5.0713,0.0053,1.0316,2.1467,0.1234,2.9067,6.276,4.4414,2.5662,0.9698,2.3644,0.298,0.2175,0.0002,3.649,3.9336,1.5269,0.1925,0.0036,2.222,3.7437,0.2863,1.8565,4.994,3.9385,0.3019,0.2094,1.3402,2.8956,1.5808,3.2422,2.3743,1.5456,4.7948,5.0379,1.4984,1.8725,6.033,3.4985,0.5654,4.8033,2.9546,1.6946,0.12,1.6171,1.9201,0.1946,2.6559,2.6732,1.6862,2.7607,0.0355,4.6841,2.3945,3.3936,1.9482,0.9269,3.8591,3.3719,2.5191,4.4849,5.9614,4.0874,4.2645,4.1712,5.1466,1.6473,1.8349,2.5177,2.491,2.1777,5.0715,1.04,3.5876,5.784,5.2056,1.1235,0.1855,1.3399,3.0597,1.214]}

A nationwide unrest erupted as some 20 million people took to the streets, carrying messages from President Maduro to local authorities.","token_len":264,"entropy":[12.2028,0.1386,9.6698,10.8183,6.1823,6.6476,0.0016,4.5796,4.0683,4.6219,2.0309,2.1853,2.7379,2.2896,2.5979,4.6549,5.8622,1.618,0.8036,6.1338,4.912,2.8451,8.9492,10.6342,7.9674,2.6698,2.6866,2.7982,4.0052,0.0026,0.7984,5.9896,3.0186,3.1195,2.4916,6.7399,2.5175,5.112,0.0074,2.0323,1.3922,0.0158,1.2583,4.498,2.6447,0.8935,0.0144,4.7499,1.8517,0.7143,1.9418,0.0546,1.1276,1.1912,0.0328,2.9515,0.6081,2.317,3.6589,0.3927,5.8741,1.7605,0.1882,0.4163,2.9985,0.8508,0.0002,0.2073,6.1701,5.8871,2.5044,2.456,0.4565,1.9985,3.4622,0.0957,0.9231,4.263,0.9998,2.6007,2.2195,5.2604,1.2847,2.3032,3.7717,2.8325,1.5176,4.1707,3.9093,1.2095,1.0661,3.4523,1.1087,4.4055,2.5192,3.9918,3.5947,5.2307,4.191,1.4879,3.5345,1.099,3.4546,0.0011,0.942,2.8535,1.6204,3.9503,5.6344,1.9903,4.1592,3.8458,0.4493,4.4133,1.301,0.0015,0.0021,1.1082,2.1432,0.5265,2.4362,1.2527,2.5287,1.5491,2.688,5.0901,1.7589,0.2865,1.65,2.9329,1.5377,1.3596,1.116,4.1624,1.2736,1.6356,0.7058,5.1428,0.3419,1.4214,1.8562,4.4351,1.5496,1.7211,1.7778,0.9933,1.1742,4.0752,1.7839,3.37,3.9448,0.7279,2.8698,3.3902,5.4213,5.6274,6.4297,0.5862,4.2674,2.2381,3.7707,3.2845,4.2599,1.4101,2.8088,3.5398,1.2697,2.5546,0.4873,1.7307,5.972,2.5277,0.5669,0.7566,0.4686,2.7385,0.1099,4.7024,1.8374,5.2421,6.2607,2.1462,3.7581,1.1752,2.0795,0.1614,0.2202,2.5598,0.0051,5.0511,3.4078,0.6036,1.8134,2.4388,5.4609,2.7396,4.917,2.5779,0.0005,0.5368,1.9874,2.1901,1.0238,3.6753,1.7745,0.0055,1.0149,2.4272,5.3865,2.1344,2.7573,0.0354,0.0001,4.6167,2.3512,0.9414,4.4336,0.0085,3.7757,5.2688,1.5874,2.3421,0.4795,0.0004,1.6815,2.38,0.4885,4.6482,1.3965,5.2963,1.74,0.0108,1.861,1.0501,1.7216,1.132,0.7669,1.7535,1.1623,1.6691,4.0623,4.6007,5.7287,3.5337,4.83,5.1782,3.9701,4.1703,0.4194,1.1815,0.0345,0.0193,0.0036,2.4994,5.5743,5.1893,3.9771,2.8544,1.4454,2.7461,5.0102,2.664,1.2572]}

As of late October, officials have yet to file a report stating how many of Poland's 1,200 judges actually were actually appointed or that many judges have been demoted. On Friday, the Supreme Court ordered Poland to review its current system and to revoke five judges' appointments to the court with ties to the country's military, which is accused of killing journalists.Poland, which has been trying to get away with legal changes since its 1991 revolution, received widespread criticism for its use of the death penalty and the controversial death penalty during the Second World War, an attempt at constitutional reform by reformists who have called for reform during the second world war.While Poland may be the most powerful dictatorship in Europe, the country's political and military apparatus dominates the political process, and the government has few avenues of influence to influence society.","token_len":264,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,3.2186,0.2076,10.0935,4.2884,0.8646,1.8304,8.4929,0.1616,8.7278,3.1021,3.439,7.1996,7.6417,4.1633,1.9619,0.5201,7.3227,3.5543,0.9555,2.6553,5.0307,6.4496,7.3412,7.5845,0.0352,1.3759,0.9477,1.7478,0.5913,2.0086,9.5873,0.0172,0.5582,2.204,6.6394,2.1591,0.0295,0.9339,0.2859,2.3636,5.9191,0.6346,0.903,1.9539,0.0353,6.0257,3.6009,1.0832,1.1218,4.7652,0.265,7.3157,0.1103,2.5148,4.6329,1.6471,1.0943,1.989,1.5247,0.1005,0.889,1.9828,5.645,0.885,3.0815,0.7983,2.1081,0.169,2.593,3.2844,0.0034,4.8627,3.6962,3.5882,1.6868,4.7463,2.3893,4.6864,1.0736,0.9093,4.7725,2.1167,4.313,2.0909,0.9983,0.9156,5.3066,1.5415,2.425,0.0465,2.2049,5.3787,5.447,0.0221,0.8517,5.7987,1.846,2.7484,2.6488,0.2051,4.9732,3.1618,4.9263,0.0004,4.1524,1.1314,2.6264,6.9607,2.554,0.9586,2.3139,2.8197,0.002,3.3517,0.3209,2.2546,0.501,5.7578,4.4498,4.8597,1.4039,2.3429,4.2599,3.3295,2.4506,2.6188,0.8228,5.0455,0.0045,0.8124,6.0403,1.0097,0.0937,1.183,3.5276,0.0216,4.1328,2.3048,0.2781,4.4518,1.4359,4.2374,1.3118,2.2486,2.6169,4.944,5.3009,1.124,0.663,2.289,2.9603,0.9151,2.3727,6.1496,4.7467,0.0157,0.6602,3.0333,0.3313,3.9406,2.2939,2.016,1.8448,3.2552,0.053,4.3207,2.7349,1.3618,2.8591,0.0359,3.0638,1.0269,1.1154,1.8263,3.7394,0.1092,3.7304,6.1828,0.7834,4.7392,3.4883,1.2824,3.3092,4.9988,3.4532,0.4483,6.0886,3.331,0.464,1.7937,1.0371,4.5654,0.0072,2.3157,2.1594,0.0139,2.3018,2.329,5.0376,1.6594,0.1233,3.0118,0.482,4.9339,0.025,0.0011,1.3369,5.1233,4.3452,2.7762,5.4628,0.2052,3.3016,5.7304,1.5789,2.0617,3.5541,2.8289,0.2757,3.7966,5.6794,0.4516,4.345,1.2768,0.0032,0.3483,5.3582,2.0531,5.8226,1.5501,2.1292,1.9355,4.1255,6.2107,0.09,1.1071,0.2315,1.691,1.5713,1.1436,3.1845,1.9585,1.6057,5.0982,6.724,0.8118,2.3028,2.3914,1.8255,1.6972,2.03,2.8427,1.3737,5.7844,4.2248,2.015,2.3181,2.636,1.486,5.9663,0.6136]}

On top of that, more than 200 Americans including some with sensitive national security information had their identities accessed without warrants, with an average of 5,000 an hour going unseen by the law.Privacy advocates, however, say that a government that is running surveillance without probable cause would have an easy time justifying its use in the future, considering the intelligence community's \"near certainty\" that there are no serious issues about the actions conducted during those timeframes.But the NSA's latest decision comes amid growing public concerns about domestic surveillance law in which Americans get their metadata from every cell phone call, search history, and other data sent from cell phones to their servers.","token_len":264,"entropy":[8.3059,0.3937,0.9879,4.704,0.0868,0.1152,0.2164,4.9637,0.1391,5.1396,1.9,6.7316,3.0209,0.4028,5.4471,1.2929,3.0234,0.0626,0.0242,16.9827,9.161,8.4471,9.6532,1.2168,2.1838,4.6024,1.6986,5.2028,5.8789,0.2866,5.4334,1.0748,1.2411,0.1724,6.0635,0.0254,4.396,0.6881,3.6768,0.9148,6.4527,3.5236,3.6546,3.0024,5.6548,0.9161,1.2028,4.1515,4.7525,2.4354,6.015,4.5963,0.4111,5.3598,1.1117,3.8155,0.1382,3.7733,5.0916,3.4157,1.9522,1.8419,1.3147,3.6335,5.3204,1.2653,0.9973,3.312,1.1416,5.3596,4.7717,4.6115,1.5339,2.8458,4.3206,5.6512,1.7014,1.6878,3.9333,1.8573,0.2542,3.012,0.6575,0.9152,0.0296,0.2579,2.1243,2.2996,2.5384,3.4369,3.2415,4.2011,1.3686,3.109,2.3341,3.6668,6.6844,4.9253,3.4492,4.2222,1.3159,4.7743,1.7065,1.9458,1.8226,6.002,0.274,1.8444,5.2222,0.0008,5.0214,5.1047,3.5304,1.2671,1.1623,4.8063,4.6939,5.2566,0.5741,2.1829,5.1482,5.2158,3.028,1.2643,1.8641,5.3391,1.7528,5.5265,1.4268,2.6963,0.0521,0.6864,5.3553,3.646,0.0041,0.7561,0.0496,4.8991,0.2257,3.5651,2.395,6.0529,3.1818,3.0551,3.4995,2.414,0.0352,0.3841,4.2416,0.4504,4.5063,4.5689,2.6189,3.1527,1.5664,3.8573,4.213,1.4291,0.2531,4.2825,1.1138,0.8047,4.7887,1.2525,5.9003,5.3353,2.6196,1.0597,4.1591,1.2443,5.5707,0.3256,2.9417,1.8401,0.0021,1.5087,1.4249,4.049,4.3611,2.2571,2.0948,5.6656,3.0224,4.5794,3.6928,0.0017,3.3044,2.6668,3.8398,4.0578,0.2653,3.3268,1.0188,2.9524,3.2371,1.3168,0.5756,2.1016,5.2644,1.1838,5.48,0.4129,0.7495,4.3204,5.5361,1.3528,0.267,0.744,3.9515,1.1345,0.5733,4.2261,4.8885,3.5872,1.4924,4.521,4.8213,3.9215,3.004,4.6534,2.1397,0.2231,3.8985,1.8632,3.0452,1.3544,4.3625,4.6136,2.7581,1.9621,1.2805,3.5581,2.0756,0.848,4.3374,0.8686,5.9225,3.3652,5.5704,3.824,6.1804,2.6796,3.2258,2.3332,4.1348,2.7595,0.1298,2.7957,1.4434,5.621,3.3757,0.5315,1.1596,2.3732,1.6886,3.7282,3.0215,3.9278,0.5942,1.3467,2.0706,4.8453,0.4117]}

A Pew poll released Monday found about three-quarters of Americans support President Obama's health care law.\n\nThat puts Trump on a collision course with those who already oppose him, who say they have a stake in his ability to get elected.","token_len":264,"entropy":[9.6169,5.5775,9.144,2.0172,3.6337,3.007,0.2972,3.3562,1.9785,1.9895,1.4933,1.8862,5.2841,11.273,0.6389,12.0309,2.2131,0.2401,4.1293,2.8326,7.5135,7.6297,2.535,3.5177,4.5869,3.5648,0.5437,2.6198,4.8323,2.27,8.9594,2.118,8.399,2.3467,1.173,4.682,0.1806,7.389,1.3466,5.0599,1.0477,1.299,0.1522,0.2087,0.0003,4.7413,1.6781,3.7521,3.5659,3.2529,5.9583,4.3921,0.9417,5.3203,1.2374,2.8484,2.1111,6.0685,4.1704,3.5885,4.5659,1.2625,2.4244,1.874,2.6137,3.5475,4.711,3.6151,3.5121,5.1386,0.4959,4.1232,4.6686,2.3944,5.8457,0.1799,2.2463,3.8415,0.1646,0.2417,0.1905,0.0003,1.4724,2.6196,1.1343,1.5817,3.2193,1.6343,2.2185,4.3367,3.2872,4.8069,0.2019,3.8576,2.0521,4.8348,3.3534,2.2086,0.0142,1.1944,1.8861,3.4503,5.3784,5.4769,0.0004,1.1562,0.281,5.8237,0.5763,0.3551,1.8275,0.0438,0.025,0.2252,7.0172,3.6349,1.5486,0.0003,6.8961,1.8895,3.9708,1.0985,1.2344,1.389,0.9773,0.1348,0.0003,2.9666,1.7079,2.3778,3.6144,0.0868,5.5586,1.0349,2.4544,0.0115,5.0459,2.743,3.6425,4.699,3.2514,4.8395,2.1122,5.2633,3.6268,0.9694,1.5556,5.8801,3.3128,1.0189,4.0342,3.0613,3.2248,0.867,2.4407,0.6104,0.4027,0.5193,4.7818,2.0853,0.022,2.1082,0.4032,3.9241,0.1661,4.9738,0.784,3.7958,0.9028,3.5766,1.2866,1.3191,3.0894,0.0211,0.9733,2.9714,5.5871,4.1168,5.1975,3.7185,0.0084,1.4764,2.1403,0.8399,4.9514,0.8622,0.6678,5.7572,0.2712,1.3056,0.0241,0.3828,2.5812,1.5573,0.1058,2.7828,1.5393,3.6568,1.623,0.3388,2.6423,2.6263,0.04,1.2585,0.9011,3.2363,5.1472,0.8683,0.0006,3.9795,2.732,1.0119,2.3793,0.1511,5.7254,2.4498,1.5099,1.7676,4.4713,0.8734,4.0401,4.2968,0.2584,0.1413,0.0298,0.7822,2.7395,3.8128,1.397,0.2205,2.0197,0.2306,0.4129,1.1694,0.1901,0.0003,5.36,5.1917,1.1048,2.6273,1.9588,1.033,0.0068,0.0272,4.7513,0.4976,5.727,3.1535,1.4308,1.0078,3.0528,2.7898,1.1113,3.0618,2.6769,3.8835,0.0155,1.3321,4.919,0.0042,3.7862,1.3044,0.5192]}

The pardon was sought under the National Civil Service Act of 1978, but he refused because it would \"totally eliminate the power of a law enforcement official to seek a pardon for contempt.\"\n\nWhen asked what he thought of the Arpaio pardon, Bolton said Arpaio's \"inadequacy\" had been \"very significant\" but noted the \"clearly significant value\" of the agency's role, and that \"the Constitution and the law are designed to achieve things\" during the eight years it has existed.\n\n\"It is clear that we need to get on with doing things in a way that is constitutional and consistent with American law,\" he said.","token_len":264,"entropy":[8.5834,0.966,2.249,1.8202,3.7178,4.9736,1.2699,0.0067,18.5048,6.6132,7.5129,5.0775,8.1097,0.039,1.2633,2.7534,9.6198,0.7384,0.0026,0.0143,0.0033,2.6733,3.1397,2.1766,0.026,0.0003,1.7412,7.3813,5.2978,1.3165,2.4194,8.5463,0.7709,2.4979,6.6814,0.0077,0.0013,0.002,0.0531,0.1192,4.253,2.3531,2.5717,4.0074,1.0637,0.9322,1.2928,3.8757,3.0266,0.7313,5.6711,0.3043,0.0026,1.3771,1.1499,2.8223,5.1318,2.7843,4.4926,5.0282,5.8525,3.317,0.7306,3.6992,5.5697,0.168,1.4949,3.4021,0.0036,5.5362,0.0001,4.6636,1.7914,1.681,1.0504,2.5075,0.9519,3.7199,1.4824,1.4852,2.1755,3.4582,6.296,2.0617,2.4788,2.3222,3.313,0.1126,1.3459,4.51,0.8394,1.8604,0.0003,2.7836,2.0611,2.5484,0.2097,0.7698,1.5635,4.8202,5.1531,0.5772,0.4144,1.0296,0.9601,0.689,2.9046,4.5707,3.6299,5.3369,2.737,5.9178,0.0548,3.3295,6.0181,2.4436,0.1637,2.1402,4.2206,1.6548,2.0958,1.4726,2.2796,2.7166,0.0033,1.0373,3.955,6.3663,2.7502,1.018,3.2903,0.9297,2.701,3.4746,1.7086,5.4028,3.274,1.0004,4.1452,4.5283,2.6844,0.3441,2.9971,4.0192,0.5129,2.9628,3.896,4.3813,4.6208,1.73,3.2659,3.3155,4.538,1.9514,5.5419,1.0111,3.5346,0.3942,3.3659,3.3559,0.5797,1.439,0.3046,4.1627,2.2015,0.4744,2.2699,3.5948,1.8907,0.7542,0.0002,6.0051,1.7227,3.3761,1.567,0.9573,0.959,0.8591,4.0699,0.1774,0.2892,0.7177,0.9248,5.3251,1.2408,2.4528,5.3045,2.9041,1.3486,1.3152,3.5097,1.741,1.0872,5.1099,2.4287,1.2286,2.7636,3.7627,2.6979,1.9747,4.3245,2.8083,3.5292,5.6204,0.6651,0.3352,0.8349,6.1181,0.5344,4.0975,3.4396,2.5246,1.5764,1.9721,1.6797,5.2461,3.436,0.8338,1.6261,2.1088,4.235,0.1547,5.5624,5.946,5.3512,5.8221,1.4963,5.6091,0.5276,2.8631,1.3634,2.8795,0.2348,0.7202,0.0002,1.2729,2.5714,1.1245,1.9972,0.4968,3.3587,3.2165,1.0905,3.5063,4.448,0.5134,3.9753,2.2298,3.2484,0.9139,1.0678,0.0632,1.5383,5.2348,1.505,3.029,0.0461,5.3388,1.0427,0.6134,1.4897,0.5419,0.1633]}

The epicenter was northeast of Khagaiin, but local media reported it was just east of the province of Amadabad.\n\nNine other deaths during the second three days of the month were recorded in Zaribast alone, and on average about 18 percent of the population are reported to suffer serious injuries, said the ministry of health.","token_len":265,"entropy":[11.0399,2.5242,0.1459,2.0623,0.148,2.9314,6.7555,3.6092,1.2941,2.8076,0.383,7.0072,0.9139,0.4368,0.2911,2.5483,6.7776,1.2316,0.1748,0.6316,1.2533,4.2408,0.6616,1.5741,0.0095,9.3676,5.7644,3.6606,2.5971,5.4481,8.639,0.0001,1.517,3.224,1.4942,0.6268,5.6051,1.192,0.0761,0.1038,0.0192,1.0587,1.9721,1.4296,0.7619,3.8688,3.9351,0.0064,0.0293,0.0193,0.1871,0.1219,3.7863,0.0003,4.0455,0.9204,1.1089,2.5644,1.876,0.9528,1.7312,3.5786,0.0901,1.1305,2.6277,0.0586,0.3605,0.8025,4.7869,0.0744,1.7582,6.3646,1.6034,2.1692,0.1312,1.3126,6.3323,1.1997,0.0416,0.2387,1.42,3.7898,0.8195,2.2913,1.9111,1.7976,1.275,0.2873,1.6986,0.0593,1.1625,1.314,3.2811,1.5228,0.7326,0.8311,0.0003,5.1062,1.0113,0.2697,0.8065,0.1829,0.0775,1.7768,1.563,0.5231,1.2274,2.0553,0.0004,2.7772,5.7537,1.08,1.2189,4.3146,2.6362,2.5187,0.7489,0.9893,0.1827,0.0159,1.8523,0.7402,4.6935,3.1586,0.0066,4.8581,0.9666,0.0066,1.8006,7.4018,0.0601,0.0164,0.9121,1.0919,1.8665,3.4571,0.3433,0.5871,5.5887,0.0115,1.1324,1.5028,0.046,5.2398,4.4963,5.044,2.3145,3.0958,3.5259,2.3297,4.4652,0.0233,1.0694,1.0996,1.7236,1.2287,4.0096,0.9589,1.4648,4.8771,1.5216,5.9674,0.0689,1.0976,7.231,0.9755,2.8839,2.23,0.2485,1.1863,0.0003,1.5468,1.2748,0.7464,0.726,0.7952,2.9844,0.1018,0.1356,0.9565,0.0187,0.043,2.8335,0.0114,4.2656,4.4664,5.4213,7.2867,1.8071,1.0722,0.01,0.0028,0.6704,0.6019,0.9741,0.7288,0.031,0.0802,1.6723,0.0049,1.9422,0.0955,0.071,0.0086,0.8452,0.2466,6.2192,1.6732,0.4979,2.7878,0.2595,3.8533,3.0474,0.0052,1.0791,3.5511,0.4963,5.2804,3.6702,1.7856,0.3369,0.7209,0.0002,6.4737,2.2109,5.4081,7.0842,0.4283,4.9861,4.6771,0.9226,0.0947,0.8711,2.6597,1.4808,2.0013,0.9276,5.7648,0.0285,0.0118,4.8758,0.4635,3.2764,5.0257,3.7393,3.08,5.025,5.4999,0.1385,1.0025,1.2683,2.4929,3.5931,0.3872,2.9692,3.5808,0.5038,1.4787,3.4987,1.5462,3.1009,0.1922,0.3996,0.7027]}

{"id":4021,"ended":true,"length":242,"gen_text":"This remote town in Peru s southern Andes was supposed to serve as a model for how companies can help communities uprooted by mining. Named Nueva Fuerabamba, it was built to house around 400 people and has become one of the top hubs of natural uranium mining.\n\nThe site is estimated to have been built on top of a rock ledge in a canyon that once led to the site of the legendary Huenum mine that was the original mining ground for copper and zinc after the Second World War.\n\nBut in recent years the site has been overrun by construction workers eager to add jobs but concerned that the new workers won't have the same access to the area as people who were originally built there. While some tribes on the site fear that mining will exacerbate the problem, mining officials say they know there may be more to the problem.\n\nMany more jobs can be created through community partnerships, said Maria Rosa Eze, an environmentalist who organized the campaign to save the Nueva Fuerabamba.

But Jordanian officials said Jordan's army, who have long relied on militias to protect soldiers, believe there are at least 10,000 terrorists who have been battling against security forces for nearly two years in southern Jordan, the northern city of Hebron and the southern West Bank.\n\n(Writing by Andrew Kelly; Editing by Robert Birsel)\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","token_len":266,"entropy":[8.6438,0.1583,7.3535,1.1537,2.3027,3.4306,0.3811,5.9377,2.6031,2.9746,0.4347,0.0071,5.096,10.6656,0.4969,10.3364,4.7813,0.7419,0.8792,4.799,7.5227,7.1463,3.8821,0.0815,3.6975,7.2648,3.8878,2.5341,8.4288,1.9254,1.3688,5.3691,2.8775,3.8953,5.7795,0.3382,1.1493,1.736,0.4357,0.8752,0.0007,4.0393,2.0196,2.5183,0.6239,2.6226,0.1054,6.0779,4.6329,4.2643,5.6436,1.6606,1.0177,2.025,5.3283,1.4584,0.2958,4.8621,1.9621,2.8746,0.983,0.2726,1.828,4.6985,0.0648,3.3847,0.3062,2.913,1.6531,3.3066,5.1308,0.1756,4.215,2.8239,2.4156,0.0175,2.2046,4.696,2.64,0.0351,1.1453,1.1895,2.2579,0.0056,4.9851,1.8165,4.2764,4.0002,1.2712,5.1344,2.0147,0.9088,6.6482,3.0135,1.9833,1.8404,2.7202,0.9328,3.2653,1.5914,0.2278,0.0002,5.8592,0.7744,4.4846,1.4449,3.4267,4.8941,0.0194,3.4824,0.4266,0.3396,2.6475,3.0809,3.2765,0.6743,1.7216,2.1072,1.0813,0.0002,3.7743,1.1563,4.6706,0.1512,4.18,1.9733,2.154,3.2882,1.3135,5.7762,1.9416,2.4914,1.752,2.3005,1.4244,2.2416,1.2281,1.3339,2.9117,5.1893,3.9303,5.7416,0.2457,0.2697,0.0014,0.0006,1.375,4.5285,1.5427,0.8557,2.9979,4.4985,2.8445,1.3436,0.0108,4.439,0.7837,1.0315,0.3002,0.0002,5.2801,1.6099,1.0955,1.5389,1.6455,2.4807,4.6607,3.0756,2.1308,5.8403,0.5168,1.1618,0.4766,3.1597,1.4147,5.0074,2.5719,1.2769,3.7418,2.6274,2.7716,0.0376,1.1566,0.7154,5.4059,1.3791,3.4976,3.2604,1.7718,1.2098,6.4074,2.1622,4.0166,3.8353,3.8691,1.6714,3.4715,5.1306,0.1295,5.1844,0.902,1.6739,4.4285,0.8482,6.2179,3.6217,1.7712,3.0551,0.0023,2.7033,1.3152,0.0164,5.5124,2.8162,1.5235,1.4313,6.1015,4.3352,2.3199,0.0262,2.9678,3.4858,1.1667,0.4961,2.8554,4.1696,0.4687,2.0907,3.1,3.7184,1.8627,0.1015,2.8433,0.0,0.8556,0.567,2.2492,5.0276,0.0002,0.2641,0.1703,0.0003,5.0365,2.2611,0.022,4.609,2.9668,0.2281,0.0502,0.0009,4.0037,0.0023,0.0043,0.1662,2.6671,0.0003,0.6095,0.0,0.0021,0.0001,0.0,0.0009,0.0002,0.0,0.0]}

The government also said more than 80 small reactors will shut in the coming years.\n\nThe units are expected to burn about 60 times more fuel than the reactors themselves, which will heat, drain and produce radioactive gases at about 700 megawatt-hour power.\n\nAt three reactors, seven more may be shut down in the next couple of years, said Tomohiko Higashiyama of the country's National Nuclear Authority, although he did not elaborate.","token_len":267,"entropy":[7.9436,1.5517,6.301,1.5651,1.4582,6.8197,2.7776,1.9147,1.0529,2.1492,6.8395,0.0016,3.3262,8.436,0.885,4.4808,0.1532,0.0045,2.1567,1.5264,2.2867,7.7582,2.6783,2.0312,1.6837,5.6655,5.3682,8.9724,17.6389,4.5991,2.8998,0.4404,1.4084,0.0816,4.8262,5.7899,1.4303,4.5239,1.8481,1.681,3.813,0.4931,0.553,0.1622,0.1646,0.0003,1.0245,2.2215,1.8661,4.7881,0.2791,5.2316,4.6677,4.5323,7.2445,2.5692,3.3202,4.876,3.0262,4.1681,0.1838,0.6161,2.3496,5.7558,0.9616,4.1559,4.1757,1.306,5.047,1.1769,0.5364,3.797,3.7541,2.7909,1.733,5.808,1.8754,1.2871,0.8353,2.6754,2.6846,1.1297,5.1491,0.0068,4.4684,4.4025,3.1572,3.821,3.0106,5.1895,0.4425,0.1196,0.5853,1.3775,0.1548,0.0002,1.401,2.6329,1.5433,0.5178,2.8119,5.3168,1.6449,5.6709,0.1403,1.0981,3.7095,4.197,1.4482,1.7279,4.7867,4.6185,0.004,0.6349,0.1843,0.3077,0.2481,0.752,0.0695,0.1201,0.2665,2.2445,1.6202,3.0381,4.7695,5.3154,2.2365,6.5889,2.7207,3.9609,2.4458,3.7397,1.1679,0.7749,0.1547,0.0002,5.0522,1.1896,0.4581,1.9223,0.3692,2.7197,0.6428,2.6549,4.3932,2.8689,0.4147,1.9048,0.2326,2.1873,2.9662,0.1721,2.4362,0.1074,0.0356,1.8645,4.4755,3.9367,4.612,6.1531,0.4235,3.9666,2.1527,1.8983,1.2417,0.468,0.0754,1.0681,0.3054,3.6928,0.4046,0.5549,1.7282,1.5622,1.5347,3.1617,6.1066,0.2905,4.3439,6.4511,1.2566,1.8681,5.9018,3.8299,1.3693,1.6267,0.5849,0.6238,0.1754,0.0002,1.3411,5.372,2.0715,1.6601,0.0032,4.0715,2.7133,4.2019,3.0055,1.1622,0.2692,0.3449,1.1201,2.7915,3.4666,0.9309,2.7342,2.4208,5.313,5.3903,4.6042,0.2011,4.1243,2.8006,4.4805,3.3929,3.747,4.8576,3.5532,1.1069,0.0068,0.8435,2.6978,2.1363,1.3718,0.4382,0.0002,4.502,5.9334,1.667,1.1567,6.0412,3.9254,5.1424,0.5355,2.3405,0.6511,2.2664,0.4222,0.8709,3.6036,0.1642,0.0768,0.9962,3.2423,5.0735,2.0869,1.2949,4.9397,1.3538,2.3853,0.0047,3.1109,0.833,6.1056,0.0181,2.9737,0.7639,1.9806,1.3256,5.9301,1.5711,2.164,0.0082,2.8562,0.5803]}

It would also add new sanctions to help patients avoid costly health care coverage altogether, but there were no immediate specifics.","token_len":267,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6722,3.4309,0.0464,0.6051,0.0002,4.0501,1.6712,2.0187,1.7887,3.009,0.0004,0.0045,0.0047,9.5779,1.732,6.0409,3.6767,2.0884,2.5003,1.7802,3.2062,6.3392,1.3297,2.8446,2.8483,0.694,5.0965,4.4066,4.009,0.7426,0.566,0.6719,2.0427,0.1317,0.7443,13.1266,1.3213,1.4707,4.8098,1.1643,4.4024,5.9577,1.4046,2.705,2.6621,0.1587,4.2004,2.2956,1.4348,0.95,2.8506,0.6707,0.0816,1.6341,1.7007,2.7113,5.0437,0.8673,3.8984,4.8503,1.2068,0.9893,0.5842,2.6925,3.572,0.2464,0.3694,0.0002,1.2197,5.6658,3.2855,3.037,1.64,3.2212,2.291,2.5016,3.3653,1.688,1.9261,1.7779,3.135,2.8615,1.1789,4.2254,2.5599,2.8832,0.3888,0.1277,1.0105,2.3745,1.566,6.4659,0.4711,0.0,0.1792,0.7777,3.2305,2.9871,0.7612,2.0318,1.5563,1.3816,5.5823,0.4309,0.3896,3.1949,2.4064,1.725,0.9167,5.0099,1.6407,4.1142,3.1025,0.7289,5.1295,1.3765,1.7496,0.2187,2.4515,0.2456,2.1942,1.3722,6.1486,0.0021,0.0013,0.9192,0.14,0.1808,0.3848,0.0002,5.5917,1.3646,1.6769,5.636,2.251,0.0259,2.7286,1.945,0.0396,1.1603,0.7604,5.8469,3.1488,1.7922,3.3994,0.8084,2.6136,5.1313,1.3258,3.8792,0.5189,0.7334,1.068,5.4218,4.6344,1.1592,2.9283,3.8963,1.1226,0.3473,5.5514,5.8552,0.4044,1.6392,3.4139,6.3437,1.08,0.1204,0.0043,1.7025,2.9615,5.9235,0.1522,4.3086,3.3747,0.3234,0.2071,0.2307,2.6056,4.6288,2.3058,5.5814,0.0276,4.2496,0.5832,2.0526,1.1825,0.7234,3.1143,1.2852,5.892,2.0723,5.078,2.3559,4.5264,5.7204,0.5542,0.2953,0.0002,2.8602,1.7477,3.053,1.3578,4.9898,5.9691,0.0088,1.5612,1.1533,3.8017,0.063,0.0376,0.1989,3.8737,1.8912,4.9857,2.6543,0.0058,1.2684,3.9943,5.1946,2.7999,0.2136,2.9396,2.4472,0.8719,0.9512,0.6432,2.6946,0.7398,1.0237,0.3549,3.0177,0.0249,5.3587,2.7367,3.1522,1.1656,7.1522,2.1158,0.323,2.3548,0.4271,0.4446,4.2087,2.7017,5.7446,1.4052,2.6754,4.5198,2.2413,2.1387,2.4915,0.7389,2.9332,5.112,1.6958,3.4424,4.1548,3.4017,0.7813,2.4203,3.3356,1.4088]}

A U.S. official said there was no indication that an appeal is imminent because the U.S. still holds asylum claims in Myanmar.The U.S. has granted asylum to Bangladeshis after decades of brutal treatment for some, including the Bangladeshis who have faced brutal abuse, and China since a Beijing-based al Qaeda group launched a crackdown against Myanmar.At least 29 people have been held in the northern city of Thachir on bail pending further investigation, some of whom were released last week after being convicted of killing a security guard earlier in the day.","token_len":268,"entropy":[9.6281,2.0644,4.3732,3.0258,5.8156,0.6152,1.8983,7.8509,0.3143,0.0375,0.248,0.8941,1.0138,4.8083,3.4974,3.9073,1.7662,2.494,5.5212,0.0099,2.1982,3.8668,0.8482,10.7072,0.0798,0.427,2.5197,0.6045,5.6867,6.6584,3.5793,7.3309,2.165,3.1503,1.3593,11.7089,3.9479,2.8897,7.8506,11.6836,10.4697,1.2304,0.9399,2.2004,0.9328,0.4454,6.5436,4.059,1.8473,0.7257,1.0956,5.3771,5.5827,4.8188,0.0033,4.1981,1.5436,2.4757,0.6871,0.8065,3.3028,0.0279,4.7395,1.6473,4.6987,0.0076,0.0027,0.1091,1.1627,2.6394,3.7902,4.9934,0.1879,0.4929,0.4415,4.7849,2.9992,3.5929,1.8866,3.898,0.5557,0.109,5.3264,1.4131,0.9325,1.7769,3.3495,3.5647,4.9683,0.0087,2.2752,3.1711,2.1816,3.9396,0.6327,5.3881,6.1254,2.5365,5.0457,5.5926,5.996,2.7542,1.9869,2.3743,1.6055,1.5357,5.3371,4.3591,0.9168,4.7155,1.7391,0.0246,0.2945,5.802,6.4991,5.1607,0.9161,4.2702,2.3363,4.6871,0.2648,4.9016,1.1269,0.2619,0.0775,2.1634,4.37,0.0125,3.632,5.8402,2.1711,2.3046,1.7627,0.0006,0.0018,0.0588,2.2215,4.0189,0.203,0.3172,0.035,4.72,3.1792,2.9244,2.7014,0.8581,2.6836,4.3359,4.2292,1.4682,1.3933,0.8268,4.4886,1.184,0.0003,0.0376,0.0288,1.5327,0.6098,3.785,1.2588,0.4221,1.7897,1.1165,4.7854,5.2045,3.6627,1.5125,4.7958,1.0888,1.379,0.0004,0.0034,0.0326,4.8888,3.0422,5.6294,3.3215,0.6916,0.4797,0.5846,1.6501,1.7459,0.0006,0.0056,0.0514,1.7814,5.3027,1.1436,0.2479,5.4785,0.9764,4.7842,5.6802,0.0746,5.1811,2.175,2.7231,5.5733,4.774,1.0986,2.4223,4.4734,0.7573,1.0534,2.1617,4.3569,3.4618,4.3049,3.4439,2.7666,6.0221,3.6278,4.061,5.0863,0.8644,2.8187,5.8052,0.3094,1.8468,3.3988,0.5173,2.993,2.3182,3.4024,2.4969,6.0306,0.3633,4.7584,0.3906,0.6918,0.4917,4.5701,0.567,1.8914,5.215,1.2032,0.0891,5.4266,6.504,1.8589,3.6117,4.216,2.6131,3.7375,1.2919,0.8727,5.8649,0.3285,0.9105,1.8967,2.1885,3.2523,0.5283,1.5343,1.3698,2.9487,0.5053,4.23,1.8968,3.737,0.1094,5.1741,2.176,0.2592,1.5346,0.2896]}

A Sanders campaign official later issued a statement saying: \"We are disappointed that the campaign was able to get away with this.\"","token_len":269,"entropy":[9.1733,7.9457,0.0078,1.9145,2.2511,7.9818,6.3236,3.2826,0.0011,0.0013,0.0019,0.2784,0.6849,2.1535,2.4476,2.3831,1.8792,2.1439,15.3514,6.8896,9.2634,1.8497,2.7546,5.6879,4.4235,7.0408,0.7886,2.6255,0.0595,0.0052,2.436,0.0984,2.9857,4.2917,0.6585,0.0459,0.4166,0.0491,0.3987,5.6698,1.1832,5.0368,0.4465,1.1577,8.1043,5.1658,4.2997,3.2408,1.4755,6.7136,1.2079,0.6422,0.8336,5.1308,0.6782,3.1871,6.4216,3.7034,1.5948,0.5628,1.5676,4.0745,6.3873,0.0045,5.8939,4.6247,0.3505,2.1913,2.9332,1.5223,1.2429,2.5569,4.2829,0.9398,0.4868,0.0002,3.6312,2.8849,4.5552,3.2603,0.4742,3.0427,0.8381,0.84,2.5099,1.5842,1.6098,3.3984,3.8187,5.4015,1.08,4.8012,1.6589,3.4767,2.3188,2.564,4.6754,1.3892,5.7983,0.7841,2.4179,5.2512,3.5918,0.371,1.1442,0.605,0.3511,0.0002,5.1896,1.893,2.7433,4.9249,0.2342,5.3544,4.9989,4.5273,1.637,0.1272,2.2543,3.5057,2.9938,1.0015,0.7818,2.3484,1.2912,1.2316,0.0002,4.051,5.0925,0.1757,0.1547,3.9214,0.8489,3.2018,1.1356,0.4049,4.1464,0.1271,0.0292,4.301,2.5377,2.5832,0.5618,3.2552,0.9693,1.0339,4.432,2.3848,0.2355,1.6465,0.9294,0.0846,4.5937,4.7914,1.3148,2.5713,5.5222,0.1495,0.7735,2.7186,1.1278,3.7891,3.3027,0.0,0.0001,0.1718,0.2702,0.5773,2.8956,0.55,0.3714,5.4908,4.1183,0.0084,6.4142,2.24,5.3376,4.0871,6.1651,0.0566,1.0929,6.1969,1.6146,2.0301,5.0898,0.0052,1.2315,1.8256,4.904,1.7373,0.232,0.0002,5.2132,2.141,0.5072,2.0433,4.9855,5.3423,2.442,4.0193,0.0156,5.6207,4.9451,0.9018,3.4951,2.3858,0.8244,1.8888,3.8769,1.468,7.0188,5.85,0.6384,2.5868,1.0003,2.162,3.9602,2.0559,3.1502,2.5704,3.9863,0.4465,3.9915,0.6833,5.8977,2.1442,0.6713,1.8781,0.4709,5.1963,2.7078,1.0146,0.9224,0.1425,2.9777,4.2052,2.8328,0.0261,0.2175,0.1713,2.8221,1.456,0.0875,4.7856,2.0381,0.7885,1.4076,4.4996,4.5954,0.2033,0.07,0.5442,3.2806,0.3174,1.3222,1.4017,3.5084,1.0285,1.5281,1.6484,2.88,2.2704,0.0041,3.5077,2.1537,0.0651,1.1353,3.1491]}

A spokesman said: \"The allegations made by the Intelligence committee's Chairman, Representative Devin Nunes, are just plain wrong.\"\n\nHe added that Twitter and Facebook have \"been cooperating in the investigation, and the companies are working with the White House, to produce evidence.\"\n\nBut Nunes, who has called for an independent probe into Russian election meddling in politics during his time as chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said on Wednesday that he wouldn't comment on Facebook officials' findings about Facebook's activities when members of Congress gather next month.","token_len":269,"entropy":[6.6897,6.4878,0.3578,0.1001,4.8302,0.0024,0.0288,0.0032,0.7634,2.567,0.002,3.9247,0.0307,2.0114,2.1541,1.7122,0.3358,9.0984,1.421,6.4593,4.0646,4.2504,7.3742,1.1184,0.314,0.317,0.7774,2.6488,0.1575,0.1887,0.1246,0.6417,0.2198,0.3938,0.0992,3.3443,6.5874,0.2857,1.0136,3.5136,1.4308,2.3379,2.6287,5.127,2.4003,1.3028,0.8328,1.8438,1.3363,1.2591,1.3136,0.1327,0.2377,0.4644,1.3158,0.1479,0.4788,0.2831,0.0002,2.9457,0.0495,0.6868,0.0154,1.3708,4.4465,0.006,0.0457,0.0092,4.0814,3.6561,1.6487,5.7903,1.4003,0.7061,1.6017,1.0241,0.9232,5.1792,1.4284,5.4216,2.7823,3.2796,3.9177,0.3998,2.0181,0.4199,3.0184,0.7696,3.9127,0.267,3.037,1.4165,2.4675,2.3854,4.0141,4.5534,0.2323,1.6232,0.6516,6.1448,5.7759,3.8418,3.0455,1.2979,0.3187,0.0002,2.6795,4.9232,2.6642,4.4991,1.1442,3.8316,2.5676,1.1489,1.1053,1.6948,3.7632,1.821,2.2702,3.0399,3.5327,0.275,2.9163,4.4596,1.5857,0.767,0.0002,1.7343,0.0005,2.6997,2.4075,0.5422,0.2844,0.0122,0.0378,1.6373,0.1299,2.9511,6.8267,1.2238,0.4496,1.3536,4.7302,0.0008,1.1956,1.5907,5.2441,2.2832,1.2764,0.9977,0.0065,4.0437,3.4178,4.369,6.2183,1.5183,2.0727,1.6093,1.8379,0.2616,1.2877,5.7475,1.53,3.6327,3.6632,0.065,2.2376,5.6906,2.7412,0.7288,1.2561,4.8712,4.5201,3.8917,3.1939,1.5883,2.1267,0.9221,0.0001,0.4022,1.1367,4.3957,3.3075,1.2514,0.8963,0.231,0.0002,3.533,0.9586,0.9365,5.2502,2.2737,0.156,1.9702,2.0246,3.1451,1.8386,2.7535,0.8803,1.0151,2.6818,0.8728,3.1214,4.3012,1.6814,2.5833,1.8039,0.8572,3.9664,0.0003,3.3063,3.0098,5.6509,2.4846,2.8877,0.2308,0.0002,4.3011,3.557,2.3197,0.9073,1.4482,3.5701,0.7003,2.3034,0.8998,2.7772,0.7243,1.6144,3.036,0.5766,2.8426,5.6626,4.14,0.6761,1.7812,0.4628,0.6501,0.2092,0.0164,2.4561,0.2106,0.0585,1.148,1.971,0.6507,0.2456,0.9628,4.2283,0.0006,1.274,0.1743,1.6647,6.8856,0.6095,5.1822,3.0837,4.0591,0.7008,3.7442,4.921,6.8553,0.377,0.4159,4.6621,4.6327,1.7958,0.5726]}

It comes as some international sanctions were lifted last week after the American and United Arab Emirates slapped sanctions on Yemen last week, the Times said.","token_len":269,"entropy":[9.8625,2.5266,3.9702,4.6611,0.1256,3.5318,0.0565,0.2532,1.8049,2.6183,0.528,0.4789,3.9046,1.3025,4.7819,0.0406,1.2786,5.7384,7.8925,0.9392,0.8985,1.4939,1.9058,2.3691,0.1237,0.0329,0.0568,1.8143,3.4127,5.9466,10.9261,12.1262,0.0205,9.4505,0.0799,1.4203,1.1374,2.1063,0.1528,2.1511,1.4634,2.2288,4.6054,1.0448,4.6997,0.0176,7.2019,4.4385,2.4654,2.1008,2.0835,4.6743,5.2957,2.8764,3.1007,4.1349,1.4948,0.0801,2.7235,4.1583,4.8837,2.657,3.7481,2.0852,5.3619,4.4052,1.5625,1.6579,1.5284,3.8189,0.5284,3.8535,3.5597,0.0005,2.0944,4.179,1.4212,2.0875,0.4911,0.0781,2.7124,2.3262,2.8072,2.2276,0.5479,3.0506,3.7046,1.4697,0.9782,0.577,1.5842,2.6461,0.8168,1.8451,2.9329,3.497,3.091,0.1254,1.7622,2.3499,1.5924,1.785,5.1244,4.821,0.8744,4.7487,0.8208,0.0037,0.354,4.0591,5.0045,5.8803,0.732,1.7248,2.4658,0.4096,6.306,1.053,1.9633,4.9087,2.5087,3.5454,4.321,0.8465,1.5402,2.4285,0.7647,0.5977,2.0807,2.8909,0.6757,3.7523,1.0603,0.1864,2.2946,3.1073,0.8462,3.2114,4.9755,0.0011,1.6063,4.7574,0.8301,4.9671,0.1634,1.0461,6.79,0.1694,1.4349,2.9386,0.126,0.4681,1.5059,3.3329,4.3761,4.2274,2.0685,1.6338,4.9016,2.1902,2.7899,1.8891,7.3116,0.1656,1.8724,4.4783,0.0033,4.5681,0.0477,1.7526,0.3294,0.5935,4.869,0.5321,0.0515,2.4774,4.8579,4.9449,1.0091,1.2251,0.6636,0.2915,0.2005,0.2886,2.0829,2.3582,2.83,2.1807,2.5665,0.3035,0.5895,1.0354,2.8274,0.521,0.6808,1.4612,1.8617,2.0068,4.8391,1.8181,1.7179,0.0422,1.532,5.23,1.2711,0.0024,4.4022,4.4873,0.8769,1.6584,0.0064,1.0537,3.8164,1.9874,1.6954,1.9593,0.3243,2.3516,4.5549,2.1538,0.4642,2.0572,6.441,1.6745,2.1101,0.2277,0.7139,3.2596,3.0503,3.0949,2.844,4.8112,0.0076,0.5053,0.097,1.609,4.8975,0.0412,3.5003,0.0761,3.9086,2.0661,1.7709,4.9214,4.9626,5.563,3.8184,0.579,4.0555,0.3905,2.1511,1.6247,5.7085,2.4683,4.9778,0.6028,0.0037,4.3823,1.3672,0.3685,1.5051,3.0608,0.9181,2.0933,2.9505,0.9083,1.6643,0.2128]}

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 1, 2017\n\nMr. Trump is set to speak at the US Women's March in San Francisco next month, where he will take a tour of the historic march through his home city amid a steady stream of protesters.\n\nOn Thursday morning, the Trump Organization signed into legislation banning refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States and is expected to be one of his most dramatic pushback at a date when he's had to respond to some of the growing talk of a global ban on Muslims entering the United States.\n\nWhile the ban won't go into effect until April 3, it's the first time that Trump promised to rescind it.","token_len":270,"entropy":[3.4603,9.9895,0.192,2.7147,0.0182,6.109,0.106,0.0384,0.0985,1.7355,0.5793,0.005,0.9532,1.8818,6.1914,2.2522,0.0003,3.7007,0.004,2.4084,0.0131,0.3066,2.6006,1.889,2.993,15.8725,6.5574,16.6742,0.7433,3.5657,6.2417,2.4952,6.2931,9.2451,0.255,4.0732,4.8855,5.7443,3.3794,0.6308,5.5194,10.3473,10.3485,3.6358,3.4607,0.7986,2.7435,0.972,1.591,2.0734,4.4491,2.5426,1.048,4.4493,4.0207,1.8562,4.3031,4.8475,5.0658,3.7568,1.404,3.4174,0.573,0.6005,3.2836,2.4321,2.58,4.4249,3.2115,3.1208,1.0659,6.0717,4.3452,4.6739,0.8025,3.4091,3.126,3.3467,2.2284,3.9484,1.0165,0.7852,1.2088,4.2627,4.3809,2.0411,1.1852,0.7578,2.7741,0.0035,0.0098,0.1767,2.0888,0.0035,3.808,0.3763,2.5112,0.48,0.0003,5.1836,1.8529,4.2752,5.5812,0.9572,1.965,1.2584,0.0391,0.0278,0.0119,0.0246,3.2294,0.0039,0.0689,0.0005,0.2465,0.0153,3.2959,1.8245,5.5371,1.9698,5.8057,0.4592,2.0997,1.8753,1.6812,4.2277,0.0003,0.0017,0.0026,0.0009,0.0001,0.0004,2.4352,3.6841,0.0002,0.0098,0.0495,0.0002,5.7272,0.0582,1.0169,3.3061,4.7393,0.0312,3.188,0.8177,0.3927,6.323,5.9897,0.1606,1.0507,1.2771,4.0681,0.1038,2.9577,1.2419,1.2261,2.2952,0.4194,0.945,4.2503,1.9481,4.5415,0.1748,0.7406,4.9138,2.7057,3.6106,2.9869,1.5191,1.7487,8.1369,2.0556,5.4654,0.3483,0.001,2.9809,0.7975,0.6645,0.0003,3.8025,1.1246,2.9575,0.1401,2.0138,3.5124,1.3436,5.641,4.5448,5.6855,3.3908,3.8132,0.9736,1.4748,0.1146,0.6018,1.2386,0.098,0.0006,0.1721,0.5281,0.1141,0.0441,0.5858,0.0069,2.8795,5.5954,1.6524,0.0065,3.9548,3.7823,0.0282,3.3378,1.9386,5.8038,5.0924,1.0714,3.3093,1.0535,6.428,1.5889,1.5223,2.3121,4.5906,1.0481,3.6774,0.1356,5.148,0.3525,0.3434,5.9056,5.5368,0.4442,2.3113,4.2996,2.8757,0.2954,1.0476,0.609,0.0369,0.7168,0.0043,0.2046,0.3812,0.0003,4.6338,1.603,2.0299,4.8605,0.0423,2.7373,0.027,0.0228,0.3753,4.5666,5.4877,0.156,1.7851,1.464,3.2945,0.5976,0.5109,2.4698,1.9527,7.2993,0.5349,4.0623,1.7245,1.2292]}

It is a member of the Organization of American States.","token_len":271,"entropy":[9.3163,2.0885,0.1668,7.2368,2.1358,1.447,1.3049,11.4783,0.0127,0.7235,0.3217,0.6837,6.659,3.5667,2.396,2.0269,0.0145,0.2727,7.3932,1.2572,6.0307,3.4414,0.0879,0.2379,2.5911,2.0026,1.4654,0.3785,1.4502,3.234,3.4706,5.0483,0.0446,2.1268,6.1066,6.1895,2.7969,4.7095,4.8569,0.7539,2.5489,2.0187,0.0033,0.7966,2.0323,5.3278,1.9388,4.8079,0.0529,2.7674,0.7081,4.8833,0.0051,0.6727,4.089,2.288,2.46,0.0004,0.0001,0.0001,0.0003,0.4585,1.868,1.2259,0.3934,0.0003,4.5539,3.52,2.0681,4.7198,0.3618,2.5321,3.1624,4.457,5.7581,2.2958,0.5546,1.6658,4.7573,4.8785,4.4568,0.0223,2.5351,0.2167,0.8402,3.1777,1.7268,3.1694,2.9699,1.4518,0.0082,0.3625,0.8604,3.4885,2.0312,0.6476,0.6299,2.0752,1.5431,0.244,0.3224,1.8845,0.0004,4.1915,1.118,2.6278,1.7046,1.7099,5.1523,3.8317,1.9914,0.8886,5.813,0.4226,0.5252,2.4381,0.4303,0.094,2.3494,0.9857,1.4351,0.0004,4.3245,5.6693,2.8143,4.557,2.2756,2.0043,1.8488,1.7312,0.5014,3.6382,2.0806,3.2508,3.5407,3.3928,5.5925,4.7366,4.5442,0.0345,5.222,0.8532,1.4054,2.058,4.9583,5.8659,4.2266,3.3412,1.4146,0.8783,5.885,0.2179,2.0921,0.3658,0.9236,1.0561,0.4139,3.0829,0.2592,0.6394,2.3701,3.9204,5.8631,0.2653,0.5901,3.6744,1.9088,3.3508,3.2573,2.7527,3.184,3.0295,0.3372,1.1714,3.5539,0.2802,0.5395,0.0003,5.0009,5.8294,0.1411,0.0583,0.5954,0.6625,0.2536,0.6449,2.404,0.0005,0.0008,5.4439,3.8857,0.7642,2.0877,0.8511,2.7748,0.8391,5.8838,3.26,3.3132,1.1408,0.007,3.4473,1.258,4.6756,3.3876,2.1501,4.9107,0.0279,2.2986,1.5018,3.4256,2.6748,1.3526,0.7401,1.3203,0.6768,0.2127,0.4858,0.0002,2.7799,6.0891,3.477,5.1505,3.2232,0.3106,2.1432,4.3479,6.2948,2.8563,1.4337,2.6965,4.7743,1.3866,3.2482,4.4144,0.297,2.887,5.0463,0.1851,5.5481,0.8645,6.1045,3.0715,5.1105,0.2727,1.2407,0.0002,2.6069,0.0534,0.2571,1.1338,1.8038,0.0077,1.2825,1.9546,0.3662,1.0398,1.0886,1.4783,1.984,1.4935,3.0925,1.8498,0.0063,0.408,0.7245,0.211,0.1747,0.0006,2.5963]}

The United Nations has estimated that it killed about 350,000 Syrians on Syria's side in 2014.\n\nObama also warned that Assad will have some of the key powers it needs in Syria. \"It would be a significant shift and a major shift for Washington to have a more stable relationship with Russia, which has been a strong supporter of Assad,\" he said.","token_len":271,"entropy":[6.9248,0.1746,5.7615,2.1732,0.0175,1.8644,7.1972,9.8748,4.9996,1.5701,2.3412,5.8948,0.1572,0.9441,1.4021,0.1157,0.0961,6.0115,5.6178,0.0006,0.1193,0.1948,1.6958,0.003,0.0035,1.8482,0.0013,15.0715,7.5731,8.3111,2.3325,0.5326,1.1484,2.3644,0.0012,3.6577,0.0287,0.919,0.0016,1.1603,2.4422,0.0131,0.0241,1.3317,2.4361,0.3138,4.8768,3.4944,5.335,5.7279,1.1834,4.1885,0.3699,0.9531,0.9592,2.7137,1.265,0.4406,1.3938,0.755,0.3409,5.2216,3.0095,0.2466,2.4399,1.1972,4.6278,1.0634,0.053,0.4136,0.3535,3.2855,0.937,0.6329,4.1911,2.372,1.2247,0.7657,1.8761,1.4082,0.7853,5.014,0.5636,5.912,3.2312,0.028,2.0752,0.0771,5.2641,0.8311,0.0426,0.0328,2.3938,1.4762,0.0002,3.9849,2.7524,0.1267,5.6413,5.1753,6.094,3.8824,0.1298,3.0548,3.0759,3.5745,2.0942,2.9385,2.0087,1.9079,1.939,0.0069,3.8089,0.1317,0.2413,1.1049,2.7489,4.9814,0.0161,4.8909,1.7181,0.9378,1.2648,6.5097,1.3826,1.6851,2.0947,0.7271,3.4866,0.5679,2.5951,0.001,2.4933,0.155,2.4569,0.3288,1.5213,0.1874,0.9426,0.6718,0.9885,0.9567,0.6968,0.0002,2.9484,1.4153,5.5051,0.2792,0.7311,2.3033,2.8822,0.6237,4.1642,0.9081,1.6827,3.4274,1.1704,3.1558,4.8185,2.3115,0.3548,1.766,1.2227,5.494,0.0289,0.0278,8.056,4.1649,3.2232,1.7195,2.4253,3.3791,5.1004,3.8336,4.8469,4.9149,0.1375,0.3576,4.1387,3.2541,0.5921,0.0002,3.3411,1.9042,3.1675,1.2395,1.8389,2.6434,0.917,4.6656,0.0068,2.8738,4.4371,1.3244,1.1316,0.6753,1.5398,2.1712,1.3418,0.9026,1.808,3.994,0.249,3.8316,3.083,2.727,4.8279,0.8212,0.0051,3.0357,3.9238,3.8693,0.0356,2.2706,2.1989,2.2491,0.94,0.6966,0.0002,3.0328,2.2905,4.3386,0.9554,2.3273,3.5531,2.568,7.0526,2.9142,0.4153,5.1176,3.5029,3.9091,0.3966,2.6446,2.0365,2.3744,2.2486,3.3954,3.2932,0.3513,1.8644,5.1248,2.3519,4.7264,1.1702,2.6332,1.5839,1.458,5.394,2.6739,4.2372,1.7015,4.0279,4.1647,4.615,0.371,3.1469,1.5781,2.2108,1.473,1.492,2.0029,3.1001,1.9698,0.1464,0.9404,1.0692,0.6852,0.1195,0.2485]}

News of the departure of Doug Jones over the scandal sparked a flurry of media reporting on the alleged affair and how his running mate Doug Jones would handle it. While there was no information provided, the timing in the departure of a top leadership member of the Alabama Republican Party was not immediately clear. This article was produced after multiple sources informed The Huffington Post of allegations that Moore sought to sexually harass four teenage girls at a former sorority house, and that four of the girls have since been found to have engaged in unwanted touching of Moore's accusers. While allegations that Moore made unwanted advances on women are completely unacceptable with Republican leaders, Moore's treatment of women is simply not acceptable. The allegations come as more than 80 GOP senators have indicated they will vote against Moore this month, including several who have not indicated any hope of taking the helm of the Senate. Sen. Lisa Murkowski [R-Alaska] said Moore had denied any wrongdoing while his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said that the allegations against Moore are a \"totally fabricated witch hunt\" fueled by personal animosity stemming from accusations of improper behavior towards women.

The current budget deficit is between \u20ac80 billion and \u20ac99 billion with a 4.5 percent increase in tax burden.\n\nTired of a steady budget deficit with tax revenue dropping away in the second half of this year, the government has suggested it would make the deficit a part of the 2014 budget.\n\n\"We believe that in a balanced Budget the economy will grow at a healthy pace during the second half of 2014,\" the government said in its statement.\n\nBut the country will continue to push on with the implementation of the country's controversial \"Make in Denmark\" campaign.\n\nLast Update: Friday, 5 May 2015 KSA 14:27 - GMT 11:27","token_len":276,"entropy":[11.692,9.0126,3.9897,10.9858,4.8939,1.0202,13.5427,4.2973,10.9144,4.4062,1.8017,1.2072,7.9023,2.2924,6.644,4.8817,4.6402,3.5907,2.8469,5.8826,2.5155,2.6542,3.5794,2.3826,0.3085,1.1046,10.3623,4.0681,4.203,3.0001,5.7589,7.0736,2.893,0.746,2.2457,4.4419,0.4121,3.1379,5.357,1.922,1.7718,4.3839,0.1461,4.3336,5.021,0.9047,2.1576,4.3239,2.3097,1.9401,2.7392,1.1805,3.8508,0.0269,1.9394,2.5636,6.628,2.6764,2.6496,4.2994,1.2868,0.2629,5.5527,2.0877,3.8221,0.2402,1.5533,0.7657,0.0055,1.3254,5.4042,2.0335,4.3977,5.471,1.2862,3.0986,0.0987,1.4561,4.123,0.0155,1.6781,4.405,1.5686,1.8309,1.6098,4.4259,1.4521,3.989,5.5185,2.2253,1.5072,0.0003,4.9115,1.2417,2.5918,2.6379,2.0405,1.8258,0.0107,1.3067,0.7208,1.2976,2.9606,1.2628,2.3085,1.7037,4.4737,0.5929,1.1334,1.917,4.8212,0.0673,2.6748,3.7779,5.3677,0.6429,6.09,2.3152,1.7703,0.8898,2.5587,1.3909,1.2384,1.9539,2.4205,5.0637,0.8687,0.8548,0.3465,2.7042,0.2496,4.1558,2.1819,0.0201,0.0012,1.4451,2.5658,3.8648,1.5482,0.4334,0.8328,5.0057,1.1442,4.4407,0.1016,0.0864,0.0453,5.6122,0.0161,5.3167,1.4661,5.6044,0.9556,1.2223,0.0199,1.9784,0.8834,4.6218,3.7767,0.6855,0.4532,0.0002,5.8908,4.5664,0.1698,3.9893,5.8276,2.6274,0.5073,4.0606,4.7091,2.5377,5.4104,5.8798,3.084,1.1168,3.0688,0.6493,0.0764,1.8434,0.0294,0.4262,0.6253,0.7594,1.5444,5.1603,3.6797,2.3235,4.2816,2.6962,2.7732,2.5717,3.5779,0.0065,0.8135,5.4748,0.3595,0.8049,0.8646,0.0002,2.2473,1.6039,4.0333,0.7663,3.5911,2.7042,2.9238,5.4097,1.9194,3.6806,0.9626,1.7752,1.5581,0.7003,2.4087,1.0938,5.1744,0.4853,3.6032,0.0831,0.0355,1.3295,0.9051,1.6582,1.3096,0.5743,0.5195,1.2316,2.0215,0.4175,0.5205,0.0003,3.8807,1.6466,3.6257,3.9258,3.5698,0.1654,5.5809,2.7048,0.7604,2.032,4.964,0.0197,1.1794,4.0469,0.0493,4.3827,3.1862,6.0595,0.5411,0.525,0.2293,3.5017,1.7023,0.8983,0.0003,4.7843,3.8666,0.0011,1.0167,0.0006,3.9424,2.2744,1.629,0.0,0.0187,3.0096,0.0,4.087,0.0001,0.0,2.4848,0.0004,0.0013]}

We understand that the current tension regarding the situation in disputed territorial waters is one of the most important aspects affecting the stability of South-North Korea,'' the statement said.\n\nRead more about:","token_len":277,"entropy":[3.4758,4.8095,10.1479,4.5729,2.8128,1.0507,2.3845,0.0281,0.0025,4.9492,3.3409,3.7223,4.2362,3.8368,0.0275,0.0157,2.9655,4.0878,18.3282,8.8411,8.485,7.8302,1.2319,1.6557,3.1005,1.6681,2.6941,1.0245,2.1899,9.4276,0.231,5.0269,0.0122,0.0614,0.0488,1.0588,0.5449,0.0063,5.7794,1.0762,3.7899,2.8207,0.9495,0.0706,0.204,5.0698,2.02,2.5503,4.0253,1.2544,0.0005,0.0703,1.6794,0.4449,4.7143,1.6324,1.4506,4.4335,2.6734,0.1254,5.0323,1.4758,3.1384,0.1698,0.0039,0.0016,3.0972,3.1598,1.3513,1.9729,2.2419,1.2907,0.137,0.0559,0.5505,4.3035,1.0743,3.7476,3.7533,2.3308,1.2085,3.6119,4.0375,1.7037,0.4058,2.2669,4.771,1.2259,2.0273,1.1145,4.8322,3.7114,0.8555,0.4305,5.9704,3.9958,0.6345,4.5972,2.7207,4.624,4.6209,0.3687,0.1373,0.7381,0.0084,0.0547,4.0854,6.3149,0.8381,3.4143,0.05,3.7536,5.2585,1.1619,2.8809,2.8427,2.9396,2.3351,2.3026,0.1746,3.5374,5.4772,0.1233,0.1913,4.7223,5.7696,5.4948,0.5351,0.3932,0.007,4.7881,2.2092,2.9437,3.0097,2.5074,1.3244,4.3526,2.9468,1.5271,0.0003,0.0364,0.0009,0.4848,0.9201,0.989,3.7496,6.3026,0.3076,3.0269,2.4472,1.7117,2.1484,1.5376,1.5338,5.4495,5.9939,5.6055,5.0056,2.2424,3.6743,3.0819,0.1151,5.1776,5.0473,0.343,0.4947,2.7786,1.9412,1.4361,3.6629,1.8791,0.6394,4.4433,1.8092,0.1178,0.7247,2.85,0.0719,2.8934,1.2105,2.2417,1.2987,0.3609,3.4719,0.3542,3.5578,2.9812,4.1744,4.2047,4.6472,0.0861,4.3707,3.6068,3.4791,2.8828,3.1409,2.7329,4.1105,0.8038,1.1678,2.1465,0.1825,4.6985,0.5382,4.4352,2.2111,4.5418,3.4275,0.0029,2.2424,4.7665,2.9816,0.063,4.6156,2.5071,2.0782,3.2805,0.0147,0.0218,0.852,1.13,2.0746,1.6541,4.8873,0.6784,1.2056,6.1259,0.0016,5.5198,0.4468,2.6353,0.1502,4.2156,2.488,1.9811,1.3833,2.1051,1.7018,4.9902,0.8615,2.0691,4.5772,4.324,6.4817,0.7268,5.1057,0.4512,8.2077,6.944,0.0653,1.4434,4.2674,0.4777,0.2982,1.3541,2.0576,4.0856,6.4474,0.9844,3.6516,0.3516,4.0578,3.2184,2.3605,1.4611,6.7162,0.6193,0.4508,0.3664,0.1562,2.6465,0.002,3.0868,0.4698,0.9493,0.0008]}

The two sides are currently locked in a heated standoff over what is known as the 'Pyongyang Question', which China claims as territory and has taken to calling a sixth nuclear test during the past three years.While Australia may decide to not allow any nuclear missiles to cross its waters for fear of escalating tension, the relationship between China and India has become a bitter one.China says its territorial claims are too weak to give the country's leaders a veto over the two nations' nuclear programmes.","token_len":279,"entropy":[9.5724,4.2627,5.8881,0.2233,5.1988,4.9928,1.9056,1.3065,1.0867,3.6375,8.6383,1.098,2.5271,1.2344,5.2029,1.985,8.4627,2.7959,1.3458,4.7873,0.575,0.6648,3.7162,4.1214,3.9575,4.1719,6.4355,4.5153,4.1554,1.0576,0.2839,6.4736,3.754,0.2138,1.0013,3.1597,4.2451,2.0808,4.0954,0.2951,2.8489,2.5675,2.2175,4.0908,1.6362,3.7564,1.1726,2.0982,3.0426,1.4963,2.9546,2.4817,1.4458,1.1574,0.6344,3.2088,1.1977,5.63,0.7775,2.9569,2.285,2.8262,0.802,3.0116,2.2456,1.5359,3.057,3.144,1.8059,2.0699,0.3829,0.7279,1.2939,0.5336,4.1806,1.7761,1.6327,1.0812,2.7298,3.4568,0.7388,4.1506,2.7904,5.5951,0.1142,2.5984,2.436,2.903,6.8232,4.6235,1.2816,0.8385,2.0842,3.688,1.8181,2.814,3.839,5.9156,0.3156,5.3062,0.3999,3.3181,4.3797,1.8201,3.8615,0.6443,3.3745,5.5398,2.7213,0.4086,2.4076,4.9148,4.3381,1.0018,3.6465,3.0939,3.6029,0.0224,0.7568,1.876,0.1848,2.1293,2.0763,0.9228,3.8957,5.4118,2.3883,1.0849,2.016,0.4928,4.517,1.4721,0.2426,1.7476,0.7231,3.7505,2.4431,5.0062,0.0506,2.4951,3.9413,3.7511,4.8913,4.9949,3.2866,1.2771,0.0424,3.4788,2.4054,5.0674,2.2757,2.745,4.7062,2.2249,2.7641,11.899,2.2644,5.9369,0.0018,3.7892,4.8581,0.1377,3.4272,0.8132,2.731,3.3096,2.6708,1.7009,0.4027,4.2335,3.8854,0.9608,5.9311,0.8111,0.0009,1.57,0.4387,0.0125,2.7,0.8167,1.2982,1.9671,2.2345,0.3957,1.2975,3.0833,4.3227,0.033,0.3049,3.5153,2.2849,0.8527,3.8643,2.2219,2.741,0.0642,0.3949,0.8149,4.7946,0.0038,4.994,2.5514,1.2243,4.2238,1.7048,1.0174,3.8989,3.3624,3.2013,4.8475,1.9431,0.2019,1.9967,5.6732,2.0267,0.0424,5.055,1.1286,0.765,2.9635,0.4817,0.5711,5.4244,2.3685,5.0913,5.0982,0.308,5.2376,4.1918,3.2589,5.152,5.8893,1.3556,1.703,0.6383,2.2879,4.4241,2.0479,0.0688,3.7384,3.2135,0.4683,1.8448,5.4533,0.7784,2.2987,0.0308,2.0711,1.5271,2.4839,2.946,4.2589,1.5802,1.7081,3.8076,4.2208,2.1146,3.1732,0.5183,1.9399,3.9945,4.5957,0.8317,5.335,2.4798,2.5927,4.3782,4.6315,1.757,1.0913,0.3788,1.9661,4.8758,2.4283,0.3089,2.2378,2.0815,0.6929]}

A Trump administration spokesperson said any such changes are not currently being considered.Many undocumented immigrants say that they have no fear of deportation from the United States, though they have been known to make the trip to the border and cross it often. As part of their legal status they are also entitled to immigration benefits based on their home country.Mr Trump has also recently made it easier for law enforcement agencies to deport and detain immigrants who might not pose a threat to the country's security.Some American workers from Mexico have also reportedly made it easier for them to illegally cross through the country's porous border, which borders two nations in Central America.","token_len":280,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,2.8326,5.4671,0.4025,5.7731,2.5927,4.444,9.6086,6.1759,1.4519,2.8353,1.452,3.0026,0.1622,0.0678,0.7008,0.0013,2.2893,0.5487,0.0789,5.6563,5.3819,4.5335,6.0843,5.6594,0.4589,0.086,4.8021,2.3181,0.8266,4.6635,0.6368,2.5022,1.5939,0.0012,4.6149,0.5431,0.7529,0.0006,0.0803,4.6589,0.1705,8.3981,1.8307,1.5145,4.2439,4.3235,3.2798,0.2581,3.3434,5.0651,4.4205,4.1958,5.5132,3.9654,1.7854,3.1595,4.082,1.0699,6.1563,0.9368,4.29,3.6562,2.0011,2.673,4.9978,1.3205,2.2949,5.2408,3.1294,3.0484,0.0973,2.9667,2.2289,0.842,2.7614,4.9078,0.6984,4.8394,1.3256,3.0249,1.8199,1.2173,0.3831,1.063,0.3872,3.3162,4.6847,5.1735,0.8377,5.8277,1.9132,0.1383,2.2795,0.145,0.0549,0.5303,0.0003,0.9847,3.4629,1.0965,0.0281,0.0023,1.5,3.7384,3.6895,5.4675,0.0797,0.4879,5.2354,0.1845,2.3513,1.812,4.5128,4.3793,1.1413,3.0631,1.0494,1.2029,0.6667,3.8174,1.7523,2.5224,0.3317,4.4277,0.2253,0.2375,2.2517,4.6823,1.8044,0.676,2.5056,0.8695,3.0771,1.5069,1.8444,1.8509,2.3901,1.0168,5.7144,4.4378,0.4779,6.3008,1.6506,1.7695,3.6185,0.3209,1.787,1.7689,3.7897,4.3756,1.0977,5.1114,3.5962,0.274,4.7178,0.9669,6.0303,2.3681,3.3484,2.9524,2.6114,3.5884,1.1812,0.3822,0.7748,5.4584,2.5514,0.3964,3.569,2.2737,2.1195,1.9586,2.72,3.3433,0.3244,0.6921,3.636,0.865,0.8184,0.0013,1.4525,3.988,1.3426,2.2375,1.7313,3.1588,0.0186,4.3729,3.992,3.7132,1.4603,1.2582,2.6179,2.3614,4.0665,2.3179,4.0361,0.9921,5.4245,3.0885,0.0009,2.1417,2.2797,0.8556,3.319,1.4356,3.192,2.6186,0.0127,4.6045,1.5355,5.4307,0.1107,0.6184,4.2407,0.2423,1.7884,4.4141,0.1496,1.1538,2.2554,5.2596,2.8851,1.4547,1.685,0.2332,4.9174,0.0148,2.7106,0.1478,1.4026,4.2158,1.9192,2.1731,0.8316,5.1053,2.8251,2.9109,0.1499,0.7718,0.3151,1.0905,1.3647,2.3674,0.5084,0.6476,4.6198,5.6004,5.3534,5.1496,0.6589,1.4686,2.8829,5.3053,3.9236,1.5536,0.8386,0.3339,1.791,0.048,4.818,0.713,4.9918,0.2029,1.4683,3.9484,0.8955,0.3921,1.6847,2.2238,4.2994,5.3594,3.6878,3.3173,1.8725,0.1054,0.7396]}

One local ANC member is very unhappy with the way he is portrayed, even after hearing some of the anti-Roma sentiments in the ANC.","token_len":282,"entropy":[8.7717,9.2597,6.7199,8.7049,3.9776,7.0063,1.2558,8.0108,0.0056,0.603,0.0009,0.0,1.1633,2.0646,5.3334,3.9816,2.6313,9.2953,1.8123,4.9908,1.8722,1.6,3.0212,3.7715,3.5941,7.2562,1.587,3.1812,1.6104,3.6573,0.0026,0.0012,10.1087,8.3396,8.5466,2.1399,1.3365,6.7425,1.3992,2.1646,0.0538,5.9513,1.9032,4.3933,7.3887,0.0,0.9677,0.3487,0.4139,1.2239,3.557,1.4875,0.6617,2.2279,1.4409,5.4631,0.2283,0.0,3.6085,4.7551,0.0012,3.4956,0.0053,7.8796,0.15,4.1922,3.7571,0.4217,2.0419,0.0038,8.7268,7.4676,0.0096,2.1448,4.0536,1.9982,2.9861,0.7983,4.1966,4.9889,0.7066,2.6844,4.0934,3.9181,3.8771,1.3763,3.6931,3.0082,3.7583,1.3903,1.9211,5.0764,2.4697,2.9174,3.856,5.2985,2.8558,0.919,0.7732,1.7697,4.0719,5.3468,3.1197,4.6603,0.3483,4.174,0.2258,0.5875,3.7218,2.7474,2.2333,5.5724,1.3286,6.8583,1.3704,5.5915,5.2043,2.5049,1.3597,3.5766,3.0736,0.0688,4.0675,3.5611,2.5521,0.1412,3.9298,4.5103,2.4809,1.1463,3.1659,5.6415,1.834,5.9061,2.4969,0.5807,0.2558,0.6673,2.1909,0.1565,0.3638,0.0002,4.5893,4.492,6.215,5.2668,3.6737,3.9543,1.1097,4.1101,0.6822,0.503,0.004,0.0024,5.6862,1.987,3.3323,5.6361,5.2478,0.8357,2.1527,3.8061,2.3837,4.6617,0.0492,2.6499,6.0234,0.1307,0.3691,4.6903,2.3258,4.1554,2.3725,0.5908,5.6115,4.7653,5.3056,3.9276,2.2058,5.8522,1.536,0.7194,1.9458,4.9901,1.6223,1.6403,3.5454,2.8149,3.1951,4.0182,5.5401,4.051,3.0499,3.8014,4.0675,4.8483,1.8429,6.3446,3.9267,4.1204,0.8629,0.2298,0.099,0.1379,3.1836,1.2954,4.3882,4.3388,2.8534,1.8951,5.0872,6.1355,5.0525,8.4746,3.7787,1.5136,0.2058,4.3495,1.5475,1.7162,4.8275,0.0498,0.4156,0.4113,0.0002,4.2563,1.1006,0.0077,0.0017,1.8976,3.0339,3.0184,1.157,4.4507,1.1284,0.0012,6.0325,0.0365,1.3579,0.2787,5.967,1.5642,2.2838,3.1163,0.3804,3.6708,3.7085,0.8034,1.2757,5.3391,3.5522,0.4696,4.2356,5.0763,2.5741,1.7041,4.2678,5.2373,3.0759,0.4334,0.7894,1.8152,2.6488,1.0543,2.4777,2.3217,4.061,3.2373,5.7209,4.187,0.4756,1.1141,5.6419,0.015,5.0284,1.5688,3.5919,2.4438,1.0206,1.8277,1.748]}

{"id":4548,"ended":true,"length":275,"gen_text":"North Korea s latest missile test puts Washington within range, but Pyongyang still needs to prove it has mastered critical missile technology, such as re-entry, terminal stage guidance and warhead activation, according to North Korean officials in the South Korean capital. But Pyongyang still has to demonstrate its missile technology. In short, the American side should never worry about Pyongyang's long-term missile capability. With the latest ballistic tests on the peninsula, North Korea has tested three intercontinental ballistic missiles and six intercontinental ballistic missiles. The latest test on the peninsula might have significant consequences for the American relationship with Seoul, South Korea and Japan. North Korea has demonstrated it has the ability to rapidly develop more powerful and more expensive ballistic missiles, North Korean officials said at a recent meeting. If North Korea is the sole threat to the Korean Peninsula long term, it remains to be seen how long it can be effective on its own. One of Washington's biggest concerns are its recent ballistic missile tests, which Washington blamed on Pyongyang. The latest test on the South Korean peninsula, however, also has ramifications for Washington, as it means that the United States will have less effective weapons of mass destruction in the event of another North Korean test. Washington should not try to prevent another such test.

Letting go of Navy Admiral Antonio S.

The exercises are part of an effort by NATO and the United States to reduce its troop and command level during a crisis. The exercises are scheduled to begin in early 2017. According to the statement, the training is intended to build on the past training program of the two largest NATO nations who were engaged in naval combat over the last three decades. It marks a significant shift, with the USS Diego Garcia patrolling alongside an amphibious assault ship last year. As a result of the incidents, four members of the military have withdrawn from active duty, including several Navy servicemen who had previously served as part of the Marine Corps.

Pyongyang has not said how it plans to use its territory.\n\nU.S. officials have made some of the key negotiations with Pyongyang in recent months, including through a series of private and government contacts with Pyongyang's leader, Kim Jong-un, and the U.S. ambassador to Pyongyang.\n\nLast Update: Wednesday, 5 May 2015 KSA 14:27 - GMT 11:27","token_len":283,"entropy":[7.9562,7.9162,1.0676,2.3954,1.9409,1.6633,2.0071,5.8538,5.2857,3.0961,0.6658,5.17,3.5802,3.3085,0.2928,0.9978,0.8011,3.8957,4.6969,0.0023,0.1258,0.164,2.5474,0.0078,0.009,1.0286,0.0005,5.4271,1.9806,6.1131,5.444,0.5299,0.7789,0.6602,0.1806,6.0011,6.8969,0.1378,1.4336,0.0079,2.2518,3.8426,0.1114,0.151,0.165,0.0003,5.3425,0.2284,2.0056,0.04,0.1331,0.4655,0.9574,1.3545,1.0669,1.6123,1.9796,1.662,3.2416,0.8447,1.2827,3.338,1.5593,3.3691,5.188,2.7159,1.5604,2.3461,0.7559,0.7956,2.9179,1.4111,1.7608,1.7154,4.8792,1.8536,2.8169,3.4587,1.6318,1.5724,3.1042,0.002,0.7651,4.4949,4.1027,3.3341,1.2648,3.1001,0.5399,0.2886,0.0002,3.7861,0.8627,0.2197,1.4022,2.0923,0.8472,4.0436,5.5889,0.9284,1.4518,0.4912,3.3202,2.3854,1.9487,5.3471,1.8383,0.9326,1.7305,1.368,2.8582,3.7854,2.7164,1.6364,5.3543,0.5277,4.4189,2.9033,0.1165,0.8944,4.1906,4.9892,1.4401,5.579,0.0151,0.0187,1.525,0.0488,1.1291,7.3915,1.4815,5.0139,0.0028,0.3527,5.3133,2.4937,0.0008,0.6542,7.1194,3.9433,4.0075,0.0951,0.4461,4.4152,1.3315,3.5644,2.3952,2.7201,0.2488,0.0107,0.0057,0.2055,0.1647,1.6859,1.9613,1.4313,4.9716,2.3692,1.4977,0.0109,3.4241,3.9949,2.8691,3.3542,4.9899,4.4729,1.6754,2.3184,0.548,0.1165,0.0002,4.1134,0.0,2.8703,2.185,2.3361,0.603,1.5307,5.9151,3.6983,5.6923,2.6163,5.852,1.3277,2.3055,3.07,4.0187,1.5426,2.7345,2.0892,3.2991,0.014,3.3601,2.2282,2.8672,0.5084,2.5278,4.1757,5.9809,2.5571,0.2405,3.0132,1.7789,3.1132,2.4761,2.0125,1.8237,1.322,0.0289,1.3709,1.4406,4.7785,1.5391,0.2016,0.0002,3.1005,0.0016,0.062,0.0758,2.1098,1.4655,5.0238,5.3988,3.0799,0.4926,5.1495,5.3051,1.2423,1.2323,2.5467,0.3255,1.8873,2.1774,1.435,5.28,1.9827,1.6504,0.001,5.6684,4.3023,2.5653,3.9962,1.9528,2.02,2.0207,2.9717,0.8359,0.3455,0.0463,0.1867,0.0644,0.941,1.4388,2.4433,3.0009,0.0004,0.1164,0.5064,2.0547,0.2032,2.1796,1.4762,0.5046,0.0003,4.6528,3.0556,0.0022,0.8214,0.0008,3.8749,2.3771,2.5163,0.0,0.0014,3.3637,0.0001,4.1293,0.0,0.0,2.5543,0.0006,0.0023]}

Two others and a car were also wounded.The ministry reported that five militants were still waiting for medical treatment at a hospital but no one was injured.In the past month, government forces have killed or seriously injured Islamist Brotherhood members including some members of the Muslim Brotherhood and others who are sympathetic to the militant group. A senior state spokesperson, Najat al-Arafi, said the group carried out its attack in February with military-grade rockets with the help of local police. The attacks had disrupted some planned protests and led to local protests.Earlier, security sources said the militants had also killed five policemen who tried to block some of the militants' entrance to the southern Cairo hideout.Security sources also said that on October 9, four attackers in a car were shot dead when they tried to enter from behind a car. Both of the dead were militants, leaving one of the assailants, who was also killed by security forces, dead.","token_len":283,"entropy":[6.2525,6.1533,0.8555,3.6135,3.7683,3.4056,1.7208,0.8963,1.4607,1.7359,0.9128,5.722,4.2296,0.8016,7.4237,6.9278,8.5658,1.2741,0.7841,1.7657,3.9534,3.6816,1.428,2.5694,1.9704,6.8284,0.3728,4.9975,0.9699,8.0877,2.679,0.4779,0.7708,6.2799,0.0397,0.57,0.5597,2.7651,0.001,3.7554,0.047,1.5143,0.2129,0.1812,8.5605,2.2256,0.7676,0.9908,1.8989,2.1045,0.0008,1.8578,2.728,2.3226,0.5786,0.7705,3.4407,0.7187,0.0081,0.5156,3.4403,0.7987,0.0317,1.4518,1.5576,4.6291,1.7857,1.2607,1.1694,2.9597,4.9717,5.9849,0.0723,0.0753,2.0478,2.1228,3.3934,2.1285,0.0001,4.2738,3.8845,0.2864,6.1154,0.6487,4.4987,0.081,2.5746,1.1416,2.4823,1.5866,1.7413,1.1846,0.0007,0.4261,5.1602,2.585,5.3644,1.172,4.6806,0.7034,0.6579,1.6958,1.4529,1.4559,3.7081,5.0677,0.4377,3.8204,1.0042,0.8446,4.9591,6.5813,0.941,3.5912,0.6735,1.4766,1.1862,0.7102,6.296,2.5419,1.5708,0.5053,1.6112,0.4784,4.2691,1.7447,2.1085,3.4563,0.2669,5.1171,0.6442,0.3629,1.9206,3.1335,3.558,1.0569,4.7075,6.7952,1.4552,5.0861,4.0202,2.5271,0.0919,0.4604,3.3332,0.0064,2.5866,3.1545,1.8383,2.3267,5.3382,0.0929,0.5062,4.1435,0.3831,0.5493,5.2618,3.0797,4.3558,7.3652,2.6478,4.7228,1.3279,1.6978,0.0609,3.4246,3.7778,3.3277,0.0974,0.4316,1.5575,3.3257,5.0639,0.0037,2.887,3.1258,1.6355,5.0498,2.9117,4.4824,3.2501,0.467,2.941,5.7513,1.319,2.3801,0.0067,4.7892,3.3828,0.6911,3.0532,4.0235,3.928,5.2255,5.2594,4.7438,3.2116,2.4375,3.2918,0.12,6.053,3.5911,2.046,4.4952,1.4761,2.7932,0.8259,0.3414,1.6468,1.1639,0.9969,3.4769,1.8184,3.2188,2.2884,3.1347,4.2626,0.0051,2.759,5.7212,1.522,0.176,2.3031,0.2365,4.1464,0.8506,0.4747,5.8813,3.2728,1.5216,0.0062,0.6196,3.3704,0.2445,2.9341,0.2567,1.6285,3.8973,5.0293,3.3543,0.352,3.6553,5.3482,4.4606,1.1101,1.0975,3.7131,1.5733,0.1336,3.6808,0.7718,1.0664,0.0116,1.2776,4.3266,3.3843,0.7997,1.9402,1.6149,5.5868,2.8247,0.5005,4.0704,0.9023,4.7437,1.6132,6.2944,3.0589,2.1886,0.5839,2.4363,2.6299,1.7937,0.8368,2.9957,2.3711,2.7963,1.2469,0.1945,0.4014,2.7221,0.6699]}

On Friday, Bockin was indicted for arranging to have a former deputy chairman of Israel's Bank of Cyprus, a Turkish businessman, charged with conspiring to obtain billions of dollars of cash via Turkish money sales.\n\nA former government official said he had thought about trying the case before trial, but it would have proved too late considering the weight of what Bockin, who was not in jail at the time, had offered at the time.\n\nMr. Bockin served as deputy chairman of Cyprus's Cyprus-based Bank of Cyprus for four years before becoming head of its operations last May.\n\nMr. Cossack, a New York attorney, said he would present the evidence at a trial which will last from June to August.","token_len":284,"entropy":[7.5171,2.457,8.6169,2.3904,1.8754,7.0412,1.7542,5.6298,2.4724,0.3044,0.1365,6.5763,1.5809,0.2646,1.0858,0.587,3.5997,0.1428,1.9189,8.0401,5.2578,0.6077,0.096,3.2894,4.7915,2.2851,2.6428,0.0003,0.0268,0.0089,0.033,0.6163,2.87,2.2973,3.4015,5.032,0.9622,0.0016,5.2767,0.45,4.5828,0.8959,0.4149,3.7054,1.2188,2.4182,0.7533,5.6292,3.7317,0.4856,5.2691,5.0273,4.7041,6.0023,0.8196,1.2619,1.2215,3.091,0.359,3.3234,3.9194,0.4101,1.0043,3.7646,5.0652,4.4592,0.9651,4.9905,6.3271,2.1938,0.8644,0.0002,2.3857,3.177,2.866,4.9404,0.3284,3.3959,1.7075,4.3229,0.5078,6.873,5.6455,2.7117,1.2078,1.4621,2.997,1.7882,0.0002,2.369,1.434,2.1654,1.4293,2.6867,4.0205,6.4131,1.9939,4.9503,1.8713,4.5317,3.6267,1.855,6.045,2.1747,0.6132,3.127,3.9167,4.2392,4.9893,5.641,1.8958,0.1763,1.3676,0.9482,0.0002,1.962,3.8103,3.6108,1.9015,1.4385,1.7348,3.0792,6.6721,6.2694,1.5218,0.5613,4.3122,3.7023,0.6485,0.0191,1.7035,4.8976,1.8983,0.2302,3.8641,0.0064,0.0008,1.8108,3.8512,2.4628,5.0205,1.4805,4.4291,2.3898,5.0203,5.081,4.769,0.1273,4.9255,0.0753,3.733,1.3538,1.372,1.2988,3.2887,2.7179,1.687,0.895,4.1994,0.5377,4.0572,0.1491,4.4297,4.6107,0.3634,0.0233,2.2172,2.8764,5.3849,5.0559,2.1541,4.907,0.9031,0.5248,0.0003,3.5158,4.4055,4.5742,0.3901,1.2643,3.1992,1.3389,5.5192,2.4014,4.2929,2.8862,0.487,2.3862,4.6789,1.2788,0.7345,3.2774,2.2961,1.1871,5.4663,1.6549,3.2966,7.2094,0.9727,5.3699,0.0607,5.0025,2.61,0.003,0.0007,4.8998,1.1935,1.547,3.4576,3.0444,2.2974,1.6541,0.0324,0.0094,0.4535,0.5158,4.7657,4.2494,0.4733,0.5472,0.2818,0.3399,0.0002,5.4722,0.0741,0.6852,0.0037,0.0007,6.0222,0.6759,3.3525,0.5941,0.14,1.4412,0.766,3.3505,2.6937,0.1826,2.375,0.1787,0.0296,2.653,3.5936,0.1013,1.3195,2.8873,2.4445,0.0217,3.0195,4.5363,3.7359,3.9052,0.2141,0.927,0.0002,2.9186,0.0004,3.963,0.0658,0.001,1.5322,2.2262,5.3721,0.1632,4.4142,0.7324,2.0364,0.8974,2.5178,4.5294,1.4924,2.6387,2.0373,1.6348,2.4179,5.2047,2.3548,2.5437,3.8787,2.4401,1.4635,1.4,0.5298]}

The Associated Press reported Wednesday that House Republican leaders would support a temporary stay of tax cuts to boost corporate growth to as much as 9 percent as they vote on tax reform legislation that is already under consideration. House Speaker Ryan declined to say Wednesday when the Republican plan will go to the Senate floor. He did say he wanted to see House-Senate tax talks happen in private this month after being encouraged by President Donald Trump that the talks can proceed without a delay. While he would wait on a resolution, Ryan assured the AP with a message the Trump administration: If you want your members to vote with you on the tax bill, then you will do it. \"Our members know that we will vote on a tax change when we see what results and what impact it will have on revenue, and that's a very big part of how we have seen things,\" said the Wisconsin Republican. \"I believe what I want to do this morning is to make sure there's not a delay. I think this is what we can be effective in when we have an opportunity to bring a fair deal for our members. And so, this is what we're going to do tonight.\"","token_len":284,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,6.2192,4.8942,0.863,0.2614,4.1645,2.012,7.6636,1.5856,2.3609,0.0422,0.7507,1.8084,2.8178,6.833,0.5369,7.4434,6.4969,17.6086,9.3463,8.6872,5.4392,5.4504,2.7137,1.9858,9.3663,3.4381,0.9861,5.2613,1.93,8.2226,1.5254,6.6814,0.689,0.8554,5.1389,4.949,2.3001,2.9164,1.4516,5.329,5.3491,2.9322,1.3763,3.0795,4.2918,3.8947,2.3126,1.7377,2.7207,4.7309,0.006,0.6551,1.4876,0.1992,2.1637,2.7464,0.3297,3.4394,5.1857,0.9333,4.6135,5.6866,0.774,1.8669,0.2944,3.5254,3.9617,2.9611,5.2025,3.9653,3.8185,0.5315,0.0033,4.2026,0.3856,4.3217,1.8107,4.8867,0.8111,2.2884,0.6752,2.9196,3.3516,2.7678,5.0147,2.3104,0.6971,0.8828,4.1945,1.9332,2.9246,4.5661,0.2,1.5425,3.6059,2.635,1.8599,4.7441,0.9284,3.4002,3.6238,0.8901,0.864,0.9061,1.2948,0.7493,3.4344,2.0943,1.0749,2.9423,4.1021,0.3465,2.4514,5.3423,5.3854,1.6245,2.9367,3.8696,3.182,2.2784,5.8622,3.7542,3.5971,4.4097,5.0376,5.7423,0.2441,3.5235,0.8169,0.0052,2.7345,1.8233,3.8958,4.2165,2.2181,1.6424,2.2775,1.3969,0.2628,5.2528,3.0307,3.8051,6.1264,4.0213,1.6984,5.0029,2.5068,0.5439,6.6061,2.3565,1.0422,7.0189,1.0347,3.5498,5.9027,4.6479,0.161,6.3683,3.6634,1.4674,1.9837,3.8776,4.7591,0.1751,1.7624,3.9022,0.3663,1.2445,2.5093,0.8827,1.3107,0.2303,2.0033,1.3417,2.5073,3.5264,1.1017,0.8336,1.6787,4.6465,2.4152,3.3409,0.9399,1.6148,2.0036,3.0994,1.9324,2.9215,1.5139,6.0302,3.6852,0.9768,3.3719,2.5465,6.2743,4.168,1.4477,3.5368,1.078,0.5414,0.0142,0.577,5.6729,2.124,1.5755,1.7529,0.8814,3.7221,2.8213,3.7201,2.2796,0.0041,3.4001,0.3439,3.9196,4.7854,5.3223,2.8356,3.1365,3.9436,1.8696,0.345,0.6838,1.0328,2.1397,3.4768,4.4397,3.2394,3.6097,0.3232,0.6477,5.6003,3.4336,0.282,1.8064,2.727,0.1369,3.5951,1.2438,3.5769,0.633,1.3009,2.1576,1.3757,1.7514,3.2031,0.5264,3.4632,0.9514,3.4102,3.8284,4.8005,1.5918,4.8941,0.6415,1.706,3.4846,0.5727,0.5221,4.5539,3.109,4.8184,1.3517,2.3663,1.5325,0.3924,1.9087,2.0013,3.151,2.0372,3.7803,0.4471,1.4976,1.0014,1.2935,1.0533,0.0185,0.3511,3.4076,0.8368]}

A 2015 Harvard study showed that a $2 gun store based in New York could charge $100 to $150 for a round of ammunition, compared to $15 to $18 for a single round on the national market.","token_len":285,"entropy":[7.2936,0.4147,1.6582,6.2954,2.1742,0.5759,3.7493,0.0003,0.0029,0.238,1.0986,0.7893,0.0027,4.2968,2.5672,2.0453,0.5086,0.9555,4.7781,4.4538,2.3327,3.4009,5.2693,0.3532,6.601,1.1604,5.0686,0.0456,14.4113,8.0636,11.2569,5.2846,3.3934,6.5424,8.5552,6.2831,4.2928,6.3649,6.5667,1.9709,0.3584,0.1462,0.7965,5.5514,0.8656,0.1401,2.3411,4.6655,1.3756,1.5917,2.7529,6.0286,0.3539,1.0358,1.1656,1.9369,1.9981,5.982,1.0844,0.2317,0.0002,1.2255,1.3787,3.2263,2.6862,3.5724,0.6694,4.3817,3.8856,1.6441,2.6442,2.3865,0.7714,4.873,1.2443,4.3235,1.583,3.3443,1.3658,0.0012,0.0021,0.7552,1.8617,0.9076,0.002,3.5719,0.68,0.9341,0.1908,0.0065,0.0516,0.0003,0.001,0.1815,1.1977,3.7552,2.2053,1.2086,0.2466,2.3757,4.877,4.0037,4.8086,0.4133,2.1972,0.0629,0.3835,1.9015,2.4265,0.7771,0.0542,0.8373,0.5605,0.0002,4.7302,3.8169,5.4234,2.2363,3.9094,0.404,5.5758,2.3682,3.0967,2.8815,1.0919,1.4946,3.4951,2.1472,4.7025,1.3206,1.6674,0.9276,3.9538,3.5083,0.2558,1.2641,5.0639,0.2975,2.11,4.2575,0.0014,2.6334,2.3077,1.7132,0.2331,3.5593,1.4783,3.6781,1.8464,3.6874,0.402,5.4333,1.0238,0.5278,0.0002,3.1179,3.532,1.3149,0.0443,0.0025,5.1556,3.9596,0.127,3.1308,1.5173,0.005,3.6109,0.0009,3.2214,0.6889,2.4423,0.9632,5.0403,1.7517,1.2709,0.3991,0.121,2.0146,0.8439,2.3517,1.4795,3.3819,2.707,2.3465,5.7947,4.1955,5.1799,2.9057,0.0712,5.0779,4.0639,0.4099,2.5076,1.9911,1.3161,5.4164,4.0812,3.0085,4.0989,1.549,0.5816,0.8568,0.2706,0.2279,0.0002,5.371,2.3437,0.8781,3.2824,3.8835,0.8228,1.0385,4.7717,2.8609,2.8629,0.9803,0.2086,5.3675,5.6499,0.1304,6.003,1.2927,0.5844,0.0002,5.2465,3.7539,3.3884,0.3831,1.138,2.9831,0.9661,3.5155,5.0476,1.6378,2.3054,5.3882,1.1006,2.2801,0.6034,1.5021,3.3754,5.2007,6.1951,1.0287,3.5899,0.1426,3.3556,5.0681,2.8047,3.6518,4.0052,5.7352,0.249,1.8864,0.2745,2.1594,4.1275,0.9864,2.6766,1.6787,0.5087,2.024,0.5666,0.7841,3.8084,1.0317,0.674,1.5683,2.9823,0.7318,0.5857,3.5687,1.0244,0.0055,4.2079,0.2631,0.5902,2.5319,1.0747,4.8991,0.8562,2.8781,0.6721,0.2378]}

Holt's family declined any comment on the accusations against Venezuela.\n\n\"I just hope this person won't get his life from me,\" said Ricardo Lopez, a Venezuelan attorney in Tampa, Fla., who did not want to be named so his name was released.","token_len":286,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.2865,0.0161,6.6168,6.9087,2.8984,2.0185,0.0691,4.5471,3.1092,10.9549,11.3937,1.5225,1.0445,2.9261,0.0006,0.0454,0.1521,0.2685,0.944,2.4396,0.4214,1.9875,4.3919,3.7924,2.2177,3.6285,1.3943,0.3243,2.5088,3.3351,0.0556,3.1401,2.1554,3.1864,9.4084,0.3819,1.8413,2.862,6.0333,2.813,1.8702,3.6027,1.8661,1.3361,0.0005,0.0155,0.0277,4.9795,2.1252,5.3908,1.1973,5.2856,2.7647,0.5511,3.4426,2.678,5.2429,2.5236,4.4311,2.6844,4.6733,2.5223,2.5054,0.1834,5.2267,0.4488,0.297,0.0003,1.8354,0.0035,3.0216,0.5943,3.4949,0.173,1.1962,0.3716,0.0003,0.0037,0.0767,0.3616,4.5592,2.3447,2.7883,0.2514,0.554,6.0112,0.9424,1.3032,2.4998,4.9774,1.1285,2.8383,6.2571,1.9307,2.7819,3.0497,2.2982,3.0891,0.7355,1.9161,1.3024,0.9883,2.3986,3.9925,2.6375,1.1313,5.0078,2.068,4.783,0.0737,1.5089,2.268,1.2891,2.1057,0.9323,0.3784,0.0002,2.3324,0.0043,2.3656,2.4975,3.029,1.6322,0.0003,0.0009,0.0122,0.077,1.3931,0.6024,2.5725,2.7341,4.5336,2.4164,4.2947,4.392,1.1201,3.2221,3.3883,1.3161,1.5264,5.5661,0.5176,4.3347,5.0208,4.4654,3.7032,0.5719,1.0582,0.2191,0.0004,0.0025,0.2041,4.6652,4.8703,0.0365,0.8884,1.7924,1.4308,3.0464,2.1534,3.2194,1.7597,4.7926,0.0981,0.907,3.7266,0.0485,0.0058,0.0503,0.0457,1.1202,0.387,0.0002,3.7836,4.8967,4.904,0.7987,2.1764,6.5177,0.084,0.0022,0.0001,1.8986,1.9888,4.173,1.2533,1.4741,2.3271,0.6624,6.1789,1.2421,3.1685,2.2578,2.6072,1.4942,5.075,0.6345,0.464,0.3933,0.5623,0.4356,1.3972,4.4364,1.8339,1.3553,5.4767,1.4355,0.4905,5.3625,4.4053,2.2177,3.0019,1.812,2.1541,2.0631,1.9495,0.7836,5.4111,5.4974,3.3802,0.6473,1.5621,3.0893,1.5918,3.806,1.8228,6.3505,0.5709,3.8732,1.9136,2.569,4.4516,7.9382,0.4981,1.947,0.8133,5.3157,2.5547,4.0262,0.6918,0.1114,0.0002,2.6379,2.4421,4.5211,2.7052,3.3275,4.552,5.1972,0.0003,2.1516,3.4673,1.4867,5.6841,2.401,0.5479,1.541,5.4453,3.9099,0.6936,1.0519,2.8788,5.3121,2.9845,4.7218,0.7394,1.1666,0.2607,0.5489,4.4908,0.0384,0.622,0.0564,0.2761,0.9241,5.94,2.0205,0.4623,0.8531,4.3953,0.3247]}

These are American jobs that have never before been won,\" said Jack Gerard, senior vice president of public affairs at the Chamber of Commerce's Capitol Hill headquarters.","token_len":286,"entropy":[6.7193,0.0882,0.0354,0.0301,2.9584,0.6911,0.0046,12.5043,9.8589,7.7842,7.4122,0.0828,5.9752,0.0005,5.6223,4.1743,6.5616,6.6221,0.2874,0.4639,3.0444,4.1003,13.3869,0.4376,2.8675,2.6086,4.9745,3.782,0.0267,5.0175,7.8109,2.2795,0.7108,1.2004,3.8098,2.2588,2.685,5.824,4.7778,0.4055,0.969,1.9293,0.0003,0.0071,0.0448,0.8001,0.0079,0.0001,4.872,2.6859,1.1814,2.0575,2.2384,0.3026,0.3368,0.0003,4.7804,0.169,0.2669,1.6631,4.4058,4.7554,0.4109,1.357,0.0002,2.2167,0.9176,3.5858,0.3501,3.3858,0.9066,2.7877,4.2546,3.8028,0.6597,2.6207,1.218,4.6692,1.4097,3.8336,0.8808,0.3663,3.0862,2.4736,5.22,3.3967,0.3104,5.921,3.9975,0.3613,0.9559,4.45,0.9821,0.62,0.0002,5.8391,2.8594,6.2394,5.5685,3.5857,5.6787,3.5274,4.3932,2.8628,0.0558,3.595,0.0004,0.1727,0.187,4.6721,1.3597,3.6938,0.0467,4.2644,1.7336,0.9953,1.0326,5.2041,0.0214,2.7384,2.8318,2.2824,0.0006,0.0454,4.2663,2.4869,1.0175,4.0382,0.0249,3.6683,2.2691,6.219,1.6425,4.8896,0.7761,3.5288,1.7945,1.415,4.6623,4.9435,0.0679,2.3384,1.4509,0.5069,0.2252,0.0002,2.2605,0.0007,0.3096,2.7891,3.8387,0.9169,5.8631,0.0068,3.3712,2.7114,5.7128,4.96,3.3127,0.9399,0.0006,1.0874,0.0026,0.4205,0.3058,3.7453,2.0712,4.4991,4.1093,3.5081,4.3725,0.5481,2.4677,2.0788,4.5119,0.0452,0.1268,7.6839,2.1408,4.9512,2.759,1.8689,5.224,2.2227,3.0245,4.7902,1.1859,1.6017,0.9597,3.4445,0.0007,0.0266,0.658,0.8198,2.2302,0.2691,0.3247,0.0002,2.452,1.8311,4.5615,1.7537,2.8194,0.5317,2.6617,1.5018,4.0149,0.0334,1.9625,1.8538,3.8389,1.3671,3.0798,4.2179,0.5858,2.6147,2.2534,1.6158,3.27,3.4422,0.8938,3.8757,5.1449,0.4013,0.3902,4.8513,1.5634,3.8644,3.5104,2.1793,1.1517,0.4275,0.0002,1.7282,2.5251,0.7617,3.0101,2.3427,3.8395,3.8422,1.2464,4.1063,0.0406,0.859,0.6576,1.1597,3.9425,0.606,3.0581,3.8458,0.8145,4.2724,1.5473,3.837,1.5363,0.0486,2.888,1.3389,2.408,2.5972,4.0215,2.6268,0.1137,3.175,1.2369,0.6291,5.213,3.9935,0.1679,3.876,0.5335,0.0161,0.882,3.6285,0.8079,0.8981,0.3138,0.3634,0.762,0.0004,4.7798,5.2199,0.1451,1.8836,0.4447]}

Senators are also expected to hold their offices for the next two years, allowing a Republican-controlled administration to quickly pick those nominees after the Senate begins holding confirmation hearings before December 1 and when the election to fill the seat is on.\n\nA key step toward Trump's confirmation will be taking up the Senate's nomination process after being rescheduled with two other Republican senators who were blocked this year. While one would need 51 Democrats to confirm Sessions as Attorney General with Republican support, Trump's pick to lead the department now has no such support.\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) has called the action an \"important step\" but noted the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence are unlikely to go through a full vote on Sessions.\n\n\"The Senate Judiciary Committee should have the opportunity to make meaningful progress on this nomination.

Kihuen was suspended from his post for 30 days by officials based on the allegations and subsequently was banned from further work for two years, where he served through the remainder of the year, which was later shortened to one year.","token_len":290,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,6.4114,7.4221,0.0259,1.0785,0.0004,0.0,4.6878,2.2225,3.1523,0.2766,0.6816,1.6449,1.8598,0.8397,0.8455,0.0452,0.0014,3.1846,6.7731,0.095,3.4945,2.921,0.0901,0.4979,0.3192,5.8399,1.0079,4.6497,0.1477,2.2742,1.2682,2.1357,0.0019,5.4472,0.6419,0.3224,0.4704,3.8263,4.9661,2.8043,0.0745,6.4988,1.3964,2.2638,1.4736,0.9344,3.5573,1.5857,0.192,0.1771,4.0124,2.7611,4.8917,1.8658,4.4725,3.6466,2.8025,7.6722,0.1756,0.0103,1.214,2.862,3.1848,1.1814,1.1015,2.8317,0.0043,0.0004,4.4358,4.509,2.3446,3.2811,0.7849,1.9928,1.8598,0.0004,1.3982,0.382,0.5029,1.5715,2.1112,0.124,1.8393,2.1944,1.447,2.6748,1.9916,3.2162,0.1956,1.9448,0.0013,0.0003,1.3065,7.286,2.6574,0.9219,1.9324,1.1897,0.8867,0.2172,0.0011,0.0001,1.4866,2.5308,4.9806,6.4579,0.5777,4.2385,0.8008,4.2803,4.0706,2.7459,3.0873,0.978,1.3077,4.9199,1.5251,2.2715,2.3033,3.424,5.6576,0.1858,1.1411,5.7372,0.0559,3.7668,3.2466,0.0459,1.5456,0.4164,0.1825,1.0224,1.4477,0.6136,1.5744,2.0298,3.5569,0.3473,0.3424,2.9028,1.8712,4.0289,0.9154,0.9618,1.3853,2.0145,1.3796,5.9107,4.2139,1.6196,4.8446,6.4629,3.1051,2.2328,0.5785,4.6064,2.6434,1.7943,0.1043,0.8596,5.8112,0.0005,1.8145,0.153,3.4292,5.2935,0.1245,2.7819,1.9662,0.0229,0.0005,2.3473,3.9613,0.6543,5.4704,0.1155,1.1665,0.3195,0.4374,0.3208,1.7147,4.9443,0.4914,2.0219,4.215,0.009,1.4141,4.8162,0.4882,1.5667,0.7472,4.5086,5.5825,2.929,3.2311,3.3033,2.3787,1.1649,0.3652,1.5743,2.179,0.0041,0.0004,4.613,3.7702,3.0085,1.9903,5.3617,2.9029,1.7879,5.9191,2.284,2.5452,1.1689,4.1746,2.5292,5.7849,5.9189,2.1838,1.1471,1.8131,4.9991,0.7334,1.2326,0.2758,0.0,6.1839,2.7824,1.9818,0.0067,5.8194,4.315,8.229,3.6924,1.0245,2.2653,4.5053,1.2147,6.2137,7.7597,2.264,0.0023,0.0004,2.3559,3.0794,0.9256,0.9344,1.8599,2.0302,4.2726,0.0255,3.9924,6.1169,5.9092,0.271,1.5397,1.1714,3.0151,3.9631,3.9557,4.6736,0.0842,4.6266,2.7674,1.9164,2.4029,0.8506,2.1851,6.5468,0.0994,3.3558,5.3842,1.6787,5.5537,0.0049,1.2799,1.2614,2.6714,5.0234,1.8133,3.2556,4.2074,0.5616,3.1855,0.4123,0.6121]}

The election to take up the presidency on April 20 will have to be held within two years, while the next presidential election for the first seat being held in 2021 will take place in April 2018.In the past, Zuma would have made five nomination rounds since 2007 but, with the country's constitutional monarchy in his grip, President Mugabe will soon be a party presidential candidate with the potential to win five consecutive elections from 2017 until 2037.This week, the new president's party, the Democratic National Party ( DNP ), received three judgeships in a seven-day parliamentary session led by outgoing leader Datuk Seri Rhee Othman.The ruling ANC is expected to seek to regain the upper echelons in a party that fell last year after Othman resigned when members of its presidential commission clashed with Oleg Sejic, the party's candidate for the presidency (Erdogan), over the president's failure to protect democracy.","token_len":291,"entropy":[8.1835,8.0398,2.7246,6.8008,0.011,2.1883,0.1187,0.0007,3.1888,6.3326,2.2052,4.5583,5.5783,1.1498,7.1312,0.4691,0.3327,3.5799,0.8984,0.0363,0.0016,0.7346,16.0597,0.5385,5.8696,0.0038,3.4835,4.6857,4.7742,3.8528,2.0631,2.5998,7.5367,8.4937,2.9518,0.7091,3.84,0.175,2.9994,2.0662,1.6951,0.0386,4.1601,5.7133,3.0834,0.928,2.8322,0.4507,0.0018,3.9822,3.4402,1.8092,0.0013,1.2367,3.5229,5.1243,6.8585,1.7378,1.9584,3.236,4.9196,2.3766,0.0681,2.6064,0.5602,5.1767,2.8749,2.8945,4.9105,2.1616,1.6724,1.3233,4.4282,0.8701,0.4086,4.0096,0.2924,0.0001,0.0176,0.0002,0.0001,0.2487,4.6006,4.534,2.0481,0.3578,2.0727,1.0699,0.002,0.6672,1.8751,5.7477,4.2542,2.5975,2.7555,0.3639,0.0056,0.6463,2.6135,4.7227,4.4625,3.9057,4.2849,0.5998,2.197,3.9933,2.7931,3.2258,1.5549,3.9572,2.2817,0.47,1.4629,3.1837,2.2651,1.2624,1.5752,2.9564,0.5616,2.819,3.1271,0.2833,3.2886,0.8437,4.051,6.6975,6.1469,0.1696,0.7312,4.6584,0.941,1.1685,0.1213,0.8831,5.0128,1.702,0.2879,3.4325,1.5787,2.483,0.772,4.0935,0.2458,4.9338,0.4751,5.2352,4.3235,5.797,2.0577,5.0962,4.2486,3.546,4.3742,2.9745,0.915,4.5086,1.3403,4.9261,3.869,2.7056,4.6811,2.7348,0.1705,5.4615,4.389,0.0001,4.5844,4.8069,1.3537,5.1984,4.6045,4.7816,0.4183,4.3053,1.5481,4.0028,0.1605,1.4913,4.0415,2.3723,1.9823,3.5392,2.9295,3.8818,3.8366,5.5759,0.2471,4.8311,2.9741,0.5452,1.5566,4.491,1.1095,3.2414,2.6355,1.6585,0.9687,1.6549,3.1241,1.3349,0.1473,3.0438,0.2007,0.3596,1.7827,2.9097,0.5251,0.0032,2.8764,2.3062,4.7397,0.0632,1.9332,4.2843,1.6263,6.3301,0.0055,5.5216,3.2242,4.1926,0.0003,0.0992,0.0014,4.2597,1.9639,4.5497,2.4488,0.0545,1.1587,2.045,4.3426,2.078,2.431,1.8454,0.0093,4.0198,2.1221,4.4719,1.8422,3.6306,4.791,0.084,0.0004,3.8822,3.6085,3.1961,1.6835,4.6422,5.8631,0.3706,2.2592,5.2005,0.0195,0.0026,2.0203,5.8323,6.0413,1.3725,2.164,5.3939,3.8962,4.2915,0.5456,3.9233,2.7471,5.6067,2.5381,2.867,1.015,1.1095,2.2769,0.0648,3.8331,0.7933,0.9369,1.5455,7.2725,5.2604,3.8993,0.0279,2.3752,1.5538,1.4606,4.7198,0.0798,5.7215,0.0194,4.6315,5.0931,1.0396]}

She said the final deal would be based on a broad package of key terms including a \"more open, open and democratic market\".\n\nWhile the EU's top Brexit negotiator said the EU had already agreed to the details of a Brexit deal, she said: \"This has the potential to give the UK some clarity on its own position so we will have the chance to talk to the European Commission and put our options there.\"","token_len":292,"entropy":[8.1703,1.7011,7.151,2.8016,8.0419,8.657,1.1333,4.8592,1.5418,2.1595,2.5083,6.1953,3.9059,0.5966,4.2647,1.4806,2.8359,6.8301,4.6322,0.7571,8.1384,4.5553,1.1151,3.0234,4.821,5.6125,0.0007,2.0577,6.8506,1.7799,0.8857,2.4614,3.3161,2.7242,0.0025,2.7769,5.0737,3.8909,0.7047,5.8189,0.9921,4.4589,4.0828,0.6838,0.2112,1.1232,1.3322,1.6685,0.1855,1.0955,1.6872,0.9289,3.6552,3.449,2.7776,0.0324,6.0906,1.5866,1.0939,1.134,1.1578,0.021,1.7408,0.4946,0.7166,0.0003,3.6682,5.0066,1.1923,3.1954,2.95,0.2784,1.076,2.1847,2.6489,2.4648,3.7084,2.0127,5.3637,4.1146,2.5992,5.5609,0.9269,7.2164,5.0201,4.8705,0.6869,2.1012,2.2653,0.369,4.3628,2.6333,0.0858,4.7129,4.1025,2.1104,0.0037,5.2965,1.7021,3.5331,2.3004,0.0382,1.7646,0.9232,0.02,4.8303,4.0185,2.9243,0.7282,4.5316,0.7427,1.7523,4.1218,0.5436,3.9227,0.4711,3.1839,2.5823,2.8264,3.9842,6.2674,0.5415,1.6187,5.4729,1.0467,1.223,0.9514,6.0734,2.3099,0.3754,2.3971,5.4906,3.1721,2.0955,3.2843,6.3411,5.648,1.7462,0.4846,4.0271,1.5192,1.5529,2.9093,3.1511,0.7948,4.8909,0.2034,0.2163,0.1178,0.5558,5.1104,1.8396,1.6289,0.0545,5.2663,3.4457,0.9499,1.5541,4.7462,3.2756,4.5121,0.8416,5.805,0.0049,0.0862,4.3453,1.283,0.3541,0.0002,3.7066,0.9078,1.4523,4.5998,4.2643,5.3692,0.9055,5.625,3.8353,1.0676,1.6165,2.8951,4.2292,1.2452,5.1611,2.0503,1.3564,4.8954,4.754,4.606,2.5057,4.9769,4.4037,2.2465,1.1543,6.2011,3.4281,0.4195,0.0158,2.2396,3.5459,3.3696,2.4887,2.5561,1.2641,0.6062,0.4327,3.5577,1.2901,1.3833,4.0726,2.8003,1.4916,0.8866,4.4631,0.0565,1.3809,4.7096,4.7701,0.1366,4.7183,5.3136,2.6501,2.2244,2.1539,5.1991,3.1025,1.1341,2.39,0.459,3.487,6.6494,2.2792,0.3994,0.0002,5.3327,1.4885,1.8344,2.3095,3.5763,2.5034,0.0753,3.1887,1.5726,2.6181,2.5129,3.6666,1.66,1.1982,2.4296,3.9306,0.327,1.9439,3.1685,0.1548,0.8254,2.3207,1.054,2.3016,0.004,2.9797,3.5244,4.446,0.4958,0.0818,4.4422,1.8466,1.3736,3.7443,2.8774,1.1725,2.2541,2.9663,3.1974,5.9576,1.6683,1.6431,2.3519,2.966,3.2526,0.0656,3.9666,0.9119,1.16,2.1387,0.6909,1.4626,5.4385,3.0176,3.874,3.8467,0.8587]}

And I'm concerned that it would do far more harm to transgender people than what has been done.\"\n\nTrump also said he will never support a federal ban on transgender troops.\n\nThe plaintiffs also say Trump's decision conflicts with President Barack Obama's policy of barring federal employees from using bathrooms that match their gender identity.\n\nAs part of its lawsuit, the Military Advocate General's Office, an independent organization run by transgender individuals and military, urged Trump to change his policy by telling commanders who have yet to enforce his ban that they must keep in mind what transgender people are in any case.\n\nIf there's not clear evidence that Trump is not aware of the policy, or that he is having an adverse impact on the transgender community, the group said, the group says, it will file a formal complaint with the Department of Justice under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.","token_len":295,"entropy":[10.8565,4.8261,0.185,0.5403,2.8833,0.0333,0.0107,0.0321,0.362,8.0151,7.2657,1.6806,0.0432,5.3518,0.5624,8.3034,4.8864,1.5602,0.0045,1.7935,1.7691,1.2983,3.7172,0.9411,2.8277,0.3943,0.2048,1.5513,0.518,0.3741,0.1226,2.7701,0.0555,0.278,5.6391,2.733,3.3564,0.5876,0.3326,1.4294,3.6216,0.9986,1.0949,3.0761,1.5389,2.4449,0.565,0.0564,1.1346,1.0661,0.7164,5.2448,3.2954,5.2115,0.0367,3.6805,2.1939,1.2315,4.4152,1.0683,3.1349,2.256,4.8499,1.4879,1.3514,0.9544,0.1655,0.3062,0.0003,1.6944,1.2787,4.3428,2.2319,0.2612,5.4232,6.3263,2.381,4.9082,2.5745,0.4072,2.7055,0.4737,3.0202,0.4926,1.0742,1.7805,1.271,0.0002,1.7536,2.3116,3.4829,0.376,0.7697,1.3646,5.0489,0.0243,0.0005,0.6301,0.6278,0.0021,0.1061,2.3456,1.4908,2.5955,4.8164,5.5196,0.5019,0.4857,0.2575,0.8166,2.9982,2.9485,2.6935,0.1262,2.9848,1.2182,2.5558,0.7711,2.0781,5.995,1.8714,1.9494,1.5984,4.6561,3.8452,0.1742,0.1584,1.6169,3.0966,0.3802,0.439,3.5937,3.4759,0.7296,0.4099,2.5819,0.0974,0.0002,1.7642,2.4376,1.5743,1.2963,2.8362,5.5926,2.2442,1.1726,2.3561,2.0962,0.0813,0.3734,2.6578,1.9601,0.5153,0.0002,2.2618,3.9421,3.938,2.5163,0.9161,0.6537,3.2668,6.8399,0.0066,5.59,0.3574,0.0019,0.0087,3.1616,0.925,1.5794,3.1348,1.7998,0.2004,3.0206,1.193,0.8728,1.027,0.2486,0.5181,0.0701,0.5452,0.8852,0.0002,5.5484,2.1457,0.0017,2.4248,1.1624,0.1271,0.3254,4.5084,3.7503,0.2114,1.6824,0.5164,2.8089,2.3937,1.3064,3.1989,5.9767,0.0288,3.1938,2.4652,1.7408,2.0218,4.743,5.6993,0.4234,0.5431,3.6875,0.7437,1.2708,3.673,5.4326,5.1651,3.8696,2.9131,4.7342,0.002,3.4229,2.9154,1.3575,1.1973,1.1735,2.1256,4.2964,3.6506,0.2689,3.9487,1.4047,0.5846,1.5292,4.8442,5.9906,2.2779,0.2925,0.3042,0.0002,5.7102,5.1475,1.9238,3.9843,4.9772,2.4358,0.9392,2.956,1.6831,3.735,2.4726,0.2398,0.7029,2.0787,0.4391,3.8315,1.514,1.5488,1.5494,5.8168,2.493,2.3865,0.9673,0.2658,1.6196,1.0834,0.2483,0.2066,0.8562,2.3369,1.2718,1.3348,1.3658,2.8688,4.6714,3.3843,1.7588,1.5904,2.2816,0.3447,2.3705,0.5088,0.5742,0.1289,2.0095,0.002,1.0785,4.3834,0.9229,5.8425,0.0976,0.0034,0.0001,0.0402,0.0591,0.6364]}

That's why we're asking for help through the effort to repeal this anti-cigarette law.\"\n\nKentucky may be the only state that offers free cigarette replacement service.","token_len":296,"entropy":[10.2527,12.3564,8.4065,7.9441,11.2444,0.0113,6.449,2.5256,12.1925,2.7694,4.9166,4.4047,2.2391,2.9324,0.9924,3.95,8.7065,5.1998,6.315,6.5714,2.4856,5.7924,1.5631,1.0785,10.346,0.3525,2.1076,4.6445,0.7125,7.2045,8.2268,6.0122,0.4125,7.5022,2.2696,4.4094,0.7369,1.6422,0.3198,0.742,0.0003,1.4634,3.65,4.8214,0.1997,2.5359,5.2118,0.0575,1.3106,0.8437,3.4788,0.336,6.3285,3.0258,5.5616,0.8527,0.0196,1.5506,3.1934,1.1369,1.0506,0.4787,4.7402,5.9089,0.1353,2.5552,6.6868,2.4882,1.2552,0.081,2.7675,1.6584,0.7261,0.0002,2.0892,5.2737,3.9086,1.1776,1.1448,0.4989,1.6702,1.403,4.5772,6.6136,5.5267,1.3807,4.7408,7.2181,3.3597,1.5754,2.1039,2.2612,2.9132,0.9301,2.1317,1.7147,0.7239,2.0687,2.4656,3.872,2.1412,2.6615,4.2246,0.935,4.3505,1.7398,0.274,1.4952,6.5696,2.4946,2.0376,2.8285,4.998,0.1596,1.6524,3.0216,0.0148,0.72,1.0463,0.4501,1.2777,0.5032,0.0002,4.3243,5.8283,1.0754,7.9987,0.3378,1.8056,1.1773,3.6281,4.8329,0.2716,4.6905,3.3456,1.3073,5.7743,3.7361,4.1406,0.6585,3.3846,0.0188,5.3623,3.625,1.2339,2.646,2.1128,2.7442,3.0659,4.1774,0.001,4.4387,2.6568,2.1477,5.1689,5.7879,3.5258,3.1206,0.0053,1.8997,0.0066,1.2466,1.6022,3.2754,1.3403,2.8008,0.0563,0.3517,1.283,3.7919,5.5644,0.0087,0.045,0.8179,2.9515,0.0054,5.7514,4.5888,0.422,0.0954,0.0001,0.9466,4.2766,4.8003,1.751,5.5411,1.4542,1.6916,3.1084,2.5056,0.3783,5.8141,2.9749,1.2532,5.4547,1.5066,3.8773,3.2176,0.0016,1.0074,4.4042,0.3527,4.4089,2.867,5.2233,4.1876,3.7583,5.4652,0.1647,0.5901,0.8127,3.9412,2.9037,0.0026,1.847,0.2721,0.0133,0.0022,5.1255,2.502,4.7333,0.6505,5.327,1.635,0.9119,3.7462,0.1516,0.4388,0.4292,1.222,2.7247,3.9028,0.5632,0.316,3.913,2.8601,3.5215,3.9956,0.8097,3.0526,1.2499,4.3318,0.6746,0.338,0.037,1.789,2.021,3.6662,3.8796,2.6617,0.2606,0.2149,0.4355,4.9839,1.3295,1.5945,1.8161,0.4152,4.5656,1.6832,3.6872,0.4804,0.4216,0.91,1.2917,3.1272,1.6348,4.1259,5.7001,1.2037,5.786,0.5903,2.8266,1.7199,5.7455,0.011,3.3865,0.7854,0.4984,0.083,0.0001,3.8054,0.0079,6.3761,1.5281,1.0254,0.8944,0.1588,1.6615,4.9869,2.6997,4.1645,1.5384,2.4056,1.7599]}

We also found blood on the bus and they have no memory of what happened,\" Mr Tan told CNN. \"They died in blood-bathing and the police are trying to collect it, so there is blood.\"\n\nA few months ago, the government announced that the Nourjung Mujahideen-e Nur al-Armed Coalition would receive funds from the State Department set aside to carry out patrols along the border from Sri Lanka to Thailand.\n\nThe United States, Pakistan and Israel have all publicly declared their support for the Nourjung Mujahideen-e Nur al-Armed Coalition.","token_len":296,"entropy":[8.0236,7.5398,7.5588,4.0617,7.9395,0.0036,1.292,9.323,2.0679,1.4707,4.0738,3.059,2.1228,3.9741,2.3563,1.385,3.3664,0.1321,1.1573,1.7278,0.8573,2.9451,0.1079,0.2846,7.4745,4.9921,1.3345,3.0301,6.249,0.0413,0.0025,2.3758,2.2658,0.4379,1.8733,2.599,11.2341,1.7808,0.1258,2.0238,0.7992,0.6454,0.0003,2.898,3.0707,1.4432,0.6612,6.2182,0.6373,4.3046,0.7723,0.4619,3.8277,0.006,7.0445,0.1239,0.0803,0.0014,6.2154,5.3748,4.2094,0.1085,0.9794,3.2436,3.8783,5.0531,2.6161,3.4678,0.1601,0.0173,0.0057,4.9681,1.381,6.0451,4.2492,0.1049,5.5882,0.1714,5.8271,1.2913,5.8253,4.0469,1.3478,2.422,0.4448,3.8765,4.1694,1.1033,7.5679,1.2145,4.9583,5.3276,0.0474,1.5077,1.4721,6.3635,4.5629,3.0209,3.161,2.0595,3.3506,0.0175,0.0096,0.0009,0.171,0.0026,0.001,0.0035,0.1617,0.0005,0.0328,0.074,0.003,0.0098,0.0013,0.1519,2.9661,0.8167,0.021,7.3289,3.1057,2.0672,2.8239,0.1112,1.3805,2.1087,1.2266,0.7111,4.8538,0.456,1.6,1.9207,4.0134,2.7168,0.3923,2.9553,0.5282,2.1539,5.4261,0.498,0.2576,0.0003,2.4924,4.1457,1.7326,4.6272,1.1728,2.5073,3.7161,2.7139,4.6251,0.1043,5.193,4.2401,2.2142,3.3096,0.1391,4.7322,1.1459,1.2354,3.5249,0.3819,3.0383,3.9487,1.9845,2.6081,1.8002,2.0161,1.687,3.7811,4.2884,5.6079,1.2307,0.5908,1.2745,1.8181,3.6486,4.3495,3.7841,4.7851,0.176,1.3337,0.2674,0.863,5.629,4.8728,2.0698,4.6679,0.4706,2.3329,2.0375,6.031,1.8288,5.8935,3.0163,6.7783,0.7815,2.0192,3.3405,1.9686,2.6464,2.0829,0.0413,4.9322,2.902,3.5155,3.0715,3.5588,0.9468,4.2262,3.4541,0.0869,0.0002,3.227,4.558,4.6002,0.3315,0.1916,1.6589,2.7001,3.1278,1.4012,2.2849,2.5405,0.0186,0.0103,0.0025,0.0101,0.0034,0.0006,0.0027,0.1616,0.0004,0.0166,0.0378,0.0016,0.0073,0.0017,0.1651,1.3451,5.6244,4.0007,0.6952,0.6256,5.5389,1.1768,7.7159,0.4768,2.1792,3.8195,0.0254,5.7153,2.5609,0.5736,0.3623,5.3276,5.3193,0.0055,0.6249,3.1428,0.3873,0.7467,0.0002,1.6011,3.6175,0.497,2.2651,5.256,0.5822,5.8581,0.8528,2.5023,5.1177,4.095,1.4295,0.2471,0.1384,0.3521,1.1315,0.0039,0.0048,0.0045,0.0081,0.0029,0.0006,0.0023,0.0699,0.0006,0.0177,0.046,0.0012,0.0041,0.0019,0.0203,1.0306]}

She confirmed to CNBC that she will not seek a second term.\n\nPowell's nomination has been met with mixed reaction from former Fed chairwomen and other Democrats.\n\nSchaefer, who will serve on the Fed's research board, told Fortune the chairman's nomination would have made some of the Fed's early work less effective. \"It would have made it harder and more difficult for me not to have a second term,\" she said.\n\nPowell, who is not a woman, also emphasized the importance of working with other central banks: The Fed will set policy in response to crises such as rising inflation and rising interest rates, she said.","token_len":296,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,3.1139,2.2445,8.3563,9.6014,3.9994,0.8829,0.0147,0.5043,3.3821,2.5114,0.0014,0.1413,2.2422,0.0001,0.0008,0.0045,1.0211,0.0067,1.6558,7.0441,0.8637,5.0848,3.8276,9.017,7.4884,0.0041,0.0,2.2511,3.2578,0.0641,7.0113,4.6701,2.074,5.9763,0.0562,2.3537,4.6217,1.6159,0.5926,1.1767,0.7747,0.2158,0.0413,1.5382,0.2364,1.0596,0.2553,6.8363,5.1358,2.8986,4.6406,0.1881,2.4959,0.8672,1.9557,1.6289,1.1896,0.6661,2.0369,0.0391,0.0014,0.0004,1.2659,2.5692,2.7254,2.2453,1.2791,2.1889,3.8283,4.7963,0.0694,0.9016,2.2103,0.5351,0.2667,0.0514,1.5007,0.7161,0.0752,1.1966,5.2589,4.3299,0.0071,0.0559,0.8449,0.7328,0.0002,1.4168,0.0009,3.6227,1.743,1.4716,2.4195,2.1115,1.9509,0.0176,0.0116,3.37,1.736,4.9082,3.278,0.7042,3.9876,2.6972,2.6261,1.9878,0.6183,1.4359,4.0714,1.7757,4.8175,0.1153,3.4487,3.0748,0.6907,1.8386,3.257,2.9004,4.019,1.1955,1.6075,0.5837,0.6446,0.0001,2.1669,0.0042,1.6402,1.7799,1.4053,5.4962,2.4881,0.9408,2.2054,5.5425,0.0229,1.9836,5.6858,0.2645,0.1803,1.3632,0.1746,1.5372,3.9956,0.4506,0.0146,5.4708,3.7272,1.3383,4.132,1.3387,0.0074,0.0,7.0097,6.088,3.629,2.6447,0.2766,0.0001,1.0027,2.8056,5.9735,2.8478,2.3018,1.055,1.1729,1.5146,2.3138,0.7028,2.2797,0.3405,0.0134,1.3864,0.3206,0.0001,2.0479,0.0042,1.6888,2.5729,3.1906,1.6132,2.2737,0.0377,3.5186,2.3774,0.7954,5.7212,0.5245,2.5838,4.7222,1.7631,3.2001,4.3933,0.9115,0.8362,0.0001,4.8902,5.0545,0.3931,0.7751,0.6887,5.1394,1.5329,3.8835,0.5379,1.81,0.4696,5.5717,2.7034,0.454,2.3705,7.0189,3.1356,5.7565,1.6707,2.0562,1.9446,3.5528,5.1673,4.9147,3.8084,0.2954,2.8582,0.0171,5.4696,3.4947,3.2849,2.7475,0.9855,2.7237,2.0294,1.8015,0.2188,1.5475,1.3,1.8593,3.6953,1.2079,0.8927,0.7401,3.141,5.2103,0.0298,2.5417,1.4911,2.3129,0.0723,0.6953,0.3675,0.0858,0.1714,0.5347,0.0002,2.6299,0.0176,1.8156,0.792,2.0078,3.9236,1.0084,4.4853,0.3113,3.0824,5.4191,1.5718,1.0037,0.016,3.9784,0.5365,2.5666,1.9353,0.8094,6.2787,4.8478,1.2192,3.0795,5.4097,2.4779,2.1262,2.2903,0.0052,3.4357,2.9022,0.0017,4.7174,1.8534,0.7873,2.2448,3.1976,0.0118,1.2923,0.946,0.1082,0.1438]}

He was scheduled to deliver Tuesday night at the end of the Democratic debate in New York on the bill sponsored by Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), who was chairing the Senate Finance Committee. On Thursday, the Democrat who led the Senate Finance Committee said he would vote on the bill, only to return to his desk before the end of the debate for a vote.The Senate legislation also includes a 30 percent state tax credit, which is intended to help some New Yorkers afford an income tax credit but hurts others struggling financially, such as low-income working families.

The EU has been pressing for Israel's right to form a state in the East Jerusalem area.\n\nPalestinians, living under Israeli occupation since 1948, have used Israeli checkpoints as a method of evading Israel. During the six-year war over the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinians were increasingly forced to cross the border between their land and Gaza.\n\nIsrael has been trying to control the area for more than four years. Critics say the Palestinian Authority has made a mockery of Palestinian attempts to develop a self-rule, turning over parts of the West Bank and Gaza to the Israeli military.\n\nA UN report earlier in the week said some 6.5 million Palestinians have left the West Bank since 1948, and the number has doubled since late last year, to an estimated 800,000 now.\n\nThe UN says some 20 percent of all the Palestinians living in Gaza live in refugee camps.\n\nYeshayim say many of the displaced people who had fled their homes have been sent to towns in West Bank, Jerusalem and Bethlehem where the occupation is still present. Many, like Tulkarmik, are still living in the northern city of Bethlehem, while others are living in the West Bank city of Jericho.","token_len":299,"entropy":[6.3682,2.4977,1.9708,3.1059,3.7305,0.2544,2.4016,10.453,6.382,1.8913,1.2319,2.2233,0.0027,2.1098,7.7947,2.2347,0.2142,0.6154,12.5431,1.387,1.8454,2.2493,2.7261,5.5586,10.4544,6.5309,0.4228,3.3306,4.297,5.348,3.5769,6.4427,0.0129,4.6391,6.263,2.3664,6.8733,0.2104,3.7341,0.0258,4.3689,0.8794,1.9953,0.0017,1.1309,0.5602,0.2038,0.2827,4.5345,1.545,2.6936,2.2382,3.8566,1.9712,1.69,1.6556,1.7285,0.052,5.2912,0.2896,1.2276,1.3551,0.4286,4.1477,0.7349,1.2745,1.9899,0.6429,0.0004,5.756,0.0006,0.0003,2.9913,6.3333,2.2975,0.5893,0.8078,2.1753,1.8615,0.0846,1.3535,5.387,3.8992,3.3642,3.3058,0.7915,3.6859,0.2835,5.5256,0.0311,3.6481,2.891,5.5398,0.6774,4.6079,0.1805,0.8613,2.2457,5.9891,0.4881,3.2086,0.6187,0.0007,1.0,0.4323,0.0858,0.2998,2.7985,2.6555,5.407,1.9851,0.2171,1.6994,1.7078,1.0556,4.0198,3.2552,3.6377,0.2277,3.2583,1.6614,0.8411,0.0003,2.6188,1.5639,2.6896,2.885,0.1224,4.6679,0.638,2.376,1.2853,1.6551,0.0031,3.548,0.8464,1.5905,6.2798,0.724,1.3102,3.5762,0.5949,1.5187,4.1817,2.5661,3.0492,0.0328,4.3472,4.9449,0.101,4.5602,0.8967,3.4885,0.0037,1.2331,2.536,5.6992,3.9987,5.255,0.0104,0.445,0.2882,0.0007,0.7889,1.0547,1.2323,1.4052,2.3089,0.8672,0.6272,0.477,0.0003,3.7455,3.1537,2.5642,3.1975,4.4408,0.35,0.8576,1.2229,4.9635,3.5993,2.0135,1.1626,0.0382,0.4796,3.1683,3.1089,1.0641,0.5882,0.001,1.6806,2.8445,0.9303,1.9256,2.6367,2.0956,1.8647,3.6218,1.0127,5.8887,1.2732,0.0727,1.6186,2.8567,4.6608,0.0744,4.4308,0.0866,0.0018,5.1222,0.3015,0.7285,0.0004,1.8383,1.7349,3.1301,3.9339,4.5958,1.3756,0.0293,2.7958,2.4153,1.9075,1.219,0.2801,2.5504,1.7338,0.4509,4.2448,0.0116,1.1795,1.0116,0.0004,5.6248,2.909,5.5229,2.7625,3.7126,4.1994,0.9495,1.0671,2.1553,2.0006,3.4815,4.067,0.764,2.161,0.1604,2.0998,1.6276,3.6302,0.7541,5.7373,1.2753,4.5683,0.0162,2.0631,4.9778,0.3611,4.1428,2.3695,3.3214,5.4513,2.2301,1.9933,5.8379,0.3033,3.9582,4.3977,2.5794,4.8706,1.8333,1.177,5.4357,0.4104,1.8837,3.0435,0.9084,0.5321,1.8769,5.8892,2.9597,0.1131,3.0788,1.2325,3.205,1.1181,1.2493,1.6316,0.2659,0.9851,3.4098,0.0008,2.215,0.0132,3.0202,0.5706]}

He is also scheduled to appear in court on 29 October in Cizre which will decide on the case.\n\nThe trial is expected to take place on 15 December in the Cizre prison.","token_len":299,"entropy":[10.8391,7.3917,2.5837,2.0945,1.9847,4.2754,5.4556,0.0565,0.7935,8.7769,1.2488,0.388,1.9103,3.2967,7.3155,5.3984,4.083,0.6889,12.0963,11.8419,2.0343,4.9526,5.9867,1.6514,2.116,0.7818,6.5744,0.005,0.6975,1.9714,6.7707,0.0508,3.5443,0.8889,5.968,3.7444,2.6116,3.4473,2.3396,0.7285,3.9891,5.0933,2.3369,1.9003,0.514,0.2972,0.2884,0.0003,5.5693,3.3738,4.9194,5.6607,4.7321,4.4279,2.2976,0.5468,4.8154,0.0161,2.7595,1.3258,0.0726,3.0144,1.2,0.411,0.9352,1.4794,0.7582,0.0139,0.4013,0.0058,0.3296,0.0012,0.0001,0.7166,2.0531,1.7407,0.3422,4.6741,2.3202,5.9207,2.872,1.754,1.1465,0.025,4.2708,1.6483,2.0252,1.5386,0.1233,0.0602,0.0225,0.0922,0.0003,0.0001,0.4055,3.3846,2.0692,3.758,0.3867,1.3989,0.2822,0.0003,2.4037,1.477,2.3498,0.3441,0.8528,6.5792,0.5618,0.0094,2.929,1.3588,4.8554,0.7623,2.3424,2.9618,0.4809,0.0162,1.7067,0.5292,0.0002,2.4426,1.3516,3.0651,5.8783,0.8739,0.0686,1.7281,2.1369,1.464,1.3196,2.2674,1.8027,4.2681,4.3769,0.681,0.3849,4.0331,1.3871,3.5339,5.4492,4.9277,4.3497,4.6126,1.5656,0.2964,3.3336,0.2041,4.8274,0.0428,1.0547,5.4962,1.5076,3.5405,0.7658,5.0723,4.6162,2.1629,4.4813,0.0267,1.9819,3.5754,3.1703,1.0798,6.2167,0.8547,0.4292,0.9816,4.5476,2.2529,2.8374,1.5581,2.8137,5.0408,4.3013,1.7224,1.2833,1.0228,6.432,0.4791,0.9343,3.2725,1.2714,3.0577,5.8557,0.0335,0.3187,3.8095,0.3267,4.4463,1.982,3.9603,2.5361,3.9714,2.2875,5.2847,1.933,2.4013,0.9196,1.3977,0.7322,2.3143,3.5472,3.7132,2.1446,4.0264,1.3238,0.3726,2.4211,0.91,3.8674,1.9293,3.4164,2.0732,0.1599,5.6573,0.9807,0.0648,0.0003,4.0761,0.0045,0.0154,0.0024,1.6238,0.7734,1.968,5.0441,4.6962,0.8396,1.5229,4.0036,3.8879,0.3981,1.9321,4.077,0.1898,5.7903,4.1657,1.3246,2.6414,1.9032,1.5756,1.518,0.1102,0.4606,5.066,3.0549,4.3464,0.0378,3.5955,1.6023,3.6994,3.2369,1.8178,1.3645,0.0276,0.8875,2.2499,1.3973,1.3282,4.8667,0.0755,1.3387,0.755,0.6606,0.5977,5.2697,2.2065,3.7377,2.1182,0.0113,0.0028,7.1381,2.3893,1.5982,2.7134,2.0946,2.0561,0.4793,0.21,0.0002,1.8773,3.003,1.4804,1.5573,0.0169,2.0186,0.505,1.5821,3.4383,2.9867,1.7068,1.476,2.608,0.0122,0.0048,2.0439,1.2997]}

{"id":3760,"ended":true,"length":280,"gen_text":"The German Defence Ministry said on Monday that the European fighter jet was the leading candidate to replace its Tornado jets, which it wants to start phasing out in 2025. The ministry s \"recently announced that it is looking to replace its Tornado fleet with four Tornado variants for use in the upcoming years,\" it added.The government said it was looking to replace the Tornado jets by 2025 as part of a new strategic defense contract. It has also proposed that Tornado aircraft should be deployed and integrated into NATO.The Ministry stressed that the jets would have less warhead weight compared to other fighter planes, and that the new jet would have more maneuverability. On the other hand, the military ministry said that it would consider using Tornado planes for defense against air defense. Eurofighter jets, the minister said, were expected to meet the requirements of the new fleet, although the Ministry didn't elaborate on the details nor what kind of use it would be.\"Tornado aircraft are expected to take a new form in the late 2030s and early 3040s and the jets will also have a longer life,\" the ministry said.Tornado jets, based on a version of Lockheed's F-35B Super Hornet aircraft, were first delivered to the Defence Ministry in 2010 when it was introduced in a revised version of the Joint Special Force. Eurofighter jets have also also been spotted on the skies of Europe and Asia, although the latest development is likely to increase the number of European jets on the frontline.","token_len":300,"entropy":[8.4262,6.8786,0.4435,1.7484,1.4464,1.9806,0.6573,2.085,6.0656,6.9931,1.2017,1.8317,4.316,7.8909,3.616,1.192,2.3593,3.4864,7.5874,4.2467,1.8307,1.0838,2.8535,6.8157,0.2268,5.3188,10.1848,0.0018,0.0192,1.1566,3.6333,0.1996,3.0644,4.2708,13.2546,6.6473,5.4041,0.5132,1.681,1.2243,1.5461,1.4909,3.194,1.9389,1.4665,1.2888,0.8407,3.7043,0.7671,3.4425,1.9023,3.6834,3.8325,3.2929,0.7154,1.3243,4.9037,1.9459,1.1688,1.2482,1.8093,0.1407,4.5085,4.3712,1.9529,1.3821,1.6607,2.5604,1.0045,1.8612,1.5049,1.2311,1.9464,2.001,1.5983,3.928,1.3922,0.0006,0.9989,3.598,3.4328,5.3089,5.9104,1.6505,2.4957,2.9072,2.3123,3.8683,2.475,2.7626,3.2882,3.1624,0.4184,3.8212,5.4556,5.1613,0.9177,2.5018,4.9092,1.7048,4.2992,5.0625,0.2387,1.1226,4.8383,1.6,3.3066,4.6924,5.8087,0.2494,2.769,2.9265,0.3534,2.8305,2.846,3.4697,1.2211,1.5578,1.6229,1.369,2.9374,3.151,0.664,1.6997,2.2404,4.1834,0.0187,1.1767,6.5264,2.1636,1.4113,0.055,0.0098,0.8561,4.9154,4.7841,0.4728,1.271,2.1569,1.5542,3.7247,3.6748,1.6928,3.639,1.0427,4.0201,2.149,3.6207,3.7417,2.2495,7.089,0.2125,2.0045,2.3423,2.6279,5.5987,0.333,0.0275,1.9294,4.0758,0.0306,5.1768,1.0983,1.7067,0.4527,0.9986,1.9294,2.9248,2.2139,3.7221,1.78,4.072,3.9975,0.0014,2.8599,0.8381,1.4641,3.1106,7.469,3.2275,2.4763,0.1331,5.4708,2.8494,0.7465,1.6854,2.9327,4.8169,0.0875,0.0597,1.6411,1.0856,3.6358,0.0092,4.8078,3.1441,3.7107,2.6529,1.3581,0.6123,6.0459,1.365,0.046,1.8342,1.9436,3.1553,6.1744,0.008,3.0534,3.8521,5.056,0.6633,3.7811,2.0756,1.6853,3.9876,2.4687,1.422,0.7981,0.2815,0.1771,0.7423,4.1791,0.251,0.0194,0.8057,2.7035,4.6207,0.3845,3.0106,4.1373,0.584,4.4767,1.5453,1.8139,0.0936,0.79,2.1088,3.5981,0.2722,0.0006,4.1849,0.1652,2.1354,2.539,3.2008,0.8247,0.6298,5.699,0.2157,0.3781,2.8892,5.568,1.4607,0.6186,4.4114,1.8672,2.7931,5.5481,0.7678,0.5074,0.2379,5.2624,6.562,7.0966,1.9336,3.7414,0.0736,0.367,2.0433,2.8739,6.3606,0.4854,5.5155,2.8744,0.8191,2.6427,1.1256,2.9851,2.2555,2.7109,1.1615,4.0177,1.6935,3.9522,4.8445,1.8071,2.6909,0.0724,5.0483,0.8484,1.4697,0.0425,3.7533,1.2186,2.9785,0.3498,4.4325,0.7606]}

The vote will decide whether the government can lead the country into a civil war or if it will face a war of attrition and defeat.","token_len":303,"entropy":[9.1524,4.7626,5.8175,3.079,3.9603,3.0283,3.4741,2.0987,1.4086,3.0157,2.6159,3.4979,0.8201,5.6527,7.0614,2.5123,3.1297,3.0074,5.5451,0.0115,4.2313,2.4522,2.2648,1.4184,0.0308,0.5766,6.6409,0.2747,0.5412,0.3918,5.6106,5.4329,5.8938,4.5989,0.0477,0.6141,0.4351,5.5797,4.915,0.2831,1.3192,0.0472,4.8145,3.7417,5.1641,1.1879,0.9505,0.9551,0.1058,4.1556,3.1051,3.8314,1.3239,0.9464,5.4364,0.329,3.8866,6.2685,0.4427,4.434,2.0222,0.5238,2.0792,2.3283,5.4397,0.0106,4.1674,2.5108,5.1699,0.4116,0.942,3.639,1.4831,0.9596,0.0005,1.593,6.0335,2.2815,2.3609,0.7548,2.8658,1.5265,3.9112,5.0327,3.4246,4.7326,4.0874,1.6518,0.2443,0.098,4.9457,0.0867,0.4667,0.0403,1.1548,1.1837,4.8474,0.022,5.7435,4.2738,1.4513,0.2908,3.7436,2.8632,0.0489,2.2463,2.0084,1.9241,0.4382,3.4246,0.4907,4.8458,7.491,5.2055,6.5822,0.2429,4.6444,2.8977,2.3896,2.743,2.5067,2.6054,3.8896,2.9559,0.903,1.8221,5.2906,6.8308,0.9288,4.6044,0.1176,2.6705,5.6133,1.8491,3.1699,0.0047,3.8698,1.9339,4.0231,3.188,2.2929,2.0281,2.5255,2.981,3.3781,3.5032,0.6901,6.6809,1.5459,1.7331,3.55,0.5142,0.3469,2.8784,2.9651,6.0176,5.3128,0.0215,1.1443,1.3698,4.9402,0.389,1.0145,4.2554,4.0779,0.7483,3.152,0.0122,0.8572,3.5999,2.6644,0.8494,0.3895,0.0002,3.7149,4.4624,3.7253,7.3299,2.5774,2.0648,5.9013,0.6651,2.2354,1.8105,2.7858,2.8416,4.4988,4.1714,0.0186,3.3771,2.8261,2.9823,4.4099,2.7457,4.1417,0.5459,5.0302,0.5906,2.8913,2.8462,4.6276,5.9553,1.2834,2.7146,0.7975,5.3749,5.1702,1.865,3.4749,3.8749,0.9309,1.1021,0.9033,4.107,4.1074,5.1853,5.4397,0.7792,0.7228,0.1178,1.1584,3.5072,0.416,0.9105,0.8109,0.0003,4.7446,0.445,2.3804,5.049,4.703,0.491,2.2972,5.778,2.5531,0.7277,2.4097,1.6323,4.847,2.473,0.4122,6.4961,4.82,4.4778,1.1482,0.9585,2.0438,1.6124,2.6751,2.0826,3.0139,0.0525,0.0042,0.2055,1.6071,4.4806,2.3143,5.4784,1.903,2.7632,6.1132,2.1542,0.2806,1.2225,5.5348,3.5106,0.556,3.1257,2.2619,2.9089,3.7757,0.8735,4.5407,4.251,0.558,2.0421,5.6899,1.9091,4.4435,0.8811,0.9961,1.7054,1.5986,5.6458,1.3152,0.3323,2.2071,0.6851,2.0655,0.0108,1.8296,3.8236,0.5189,0.4855,4.8166,1.121,4.2434,1.7609,1.8243,3.0903,3.4401,0.4912]}

At the Kremlin's request, The Guardian said on Monday it found evidence of several recent efforts to undermine US intelligence agencies and to manipulate public opinion on internet politics.","token_len":321,"entropy":[8.1705,10.1353,1.7485,3.3876,5.402,3.1723,3.5317,0.091,9.5992,3.6809,4.4429,4.3313,2.2912,1.045,2.506,12.4568,16.4306,0.5738,4.6354,1.851,2.3581,5.3142,4.0356,0.7866,1.8143,7.4463,3.8259,1.9495,3.1807,0.3253,2.4707,7.3858,4.9764,0.0313,10.1057,1.07,5.7303,4.0365,3.3776,1.7181,3.8412,2.0588,1.6568,4.7599,5.5041,1.4946,0.3375,2.797,4.908,2.0759,4.2403,2.098,2.1965,3.2893,3.4291,2.9137,5.4864,4.6384,6.2672,0.5156,6.4942,1.9835,0.5566,2.5298,0.4853,2.4177,3.5993,2.7195,1.755,1.3037,2.3888,3.4306,5.3473,2.1696,1.104,3.5608,2.329,0.0056,1.1481,3.6234,1.0865,1.244,0.0003,2.003,3.0699,0.8401,7.2482,0.4245,3.4769,1.6881,4.7793,1.0346,1.6501,2.1204,0.0181,0.0031,0.6103,2.7391,2.6012,2.6748,0.237,1.2328,4.4247,2.7663,4.8126,3.6968,1.771,1.4935,2.4909,0.2999,0.2942,0.0271,1.1803,0.5021,1.0412,0.7752,1.4727,1.4023,0.5955,0.0002,3.6891,6.1286,4.9793,0.6842,4.8812,4.9099,5.5747,2.0149,0.8444,5.6551,1.6558,5.2995,0.0017,2.8684,1.5549,5.3192,2.9531,1.8289,5.3258,1.9035,2.1176,2.0275,0.9028,5.137,2.4428,4.7188,0.031,3.7521,2.049,4.2418,1.8998,0.2351,2.5566,4.1356,0.9965,1.6259,0.0049,0.0574,0.2366,0.6809,0.0002,4.1736,1.7815,3.3916,3.8887,2.1447,3.9043,0.4033,0.2357,0.8501,5.4928,5.9531,0.0062,1.9274,1.782,4.7882,1.9986,1.0022,2.9902,1.044,4.2501,0.0021,6.1099,3.8984,4.2258,0.6738,3.8776,4.2264,4.7539,2.525,0.2279,2.2594,1.0412,5.0743,1.6764,2.3618,2.9046,0.6634,1.9791,1.27,2.4764,4.5539,0.3956,5.1314,3.9912,1.4942,5.154,5.366,0.3171,6.0014,1.4148,1.542,1.0808,0.9007,4.0472,0.2301,1.8272,3.5401,1.613,0.8618,3.8215,0.4236,0.418,0.2502,0.0003,5.2541,1.4896,3.9288,4.7188,2.602,3.8083,5.0881,2.7963,3.3355,2.9811,0.8009,0.1001,2.4364,4.3315,3.3805,1.7326,0.9006,2.697,3.6658,0.0774,1.7911,3.3108,5.0558,2.1523,1.6925,4.3714,5.1949,4.7753,2.149,2.9275,5.7561,5.513,1.0282,3.0826,5.2681,3.6549,1.1999,1.0683,1.7272,0.1118,5.699,3.2257,0.4338,0.2708,0.0002,1.9034,1.3541,0.0353,0.0017,5.8087,2.3578,4.2056,1.6324,4.2092,5.6863,5.6408,0.9452,0.4218,3.9156,0.161,0.7696,2.1819,1.3494,5.1328,0.9452,6.2205,0.3432,0.6517,0.2857,5.2804,2.0725,3.5721,2.0431,2.0195,1.3816,4.8783,2.4182,1.1969,5.6124,4.179,5.0408,0.7111,4.2168,2.7526,1.9501,1.7178,2.5271,2.6877,4.9232,2.1163,0.109,2.621,4.7376,3.3503,0.3821]}

Kuwait is now attempting to resolve the dispute before any new agreement is agreed to.\n\nThe Saudi Arabian delegation announced Tuesday it had reached an agreement that resolves Saudi-led talks in the new year, after being stopped by President Hassan Rouhani, which critics of the Saudi-led coalition have said would lead to civilian retaliation against the United States, with Iran, Saudi Arabia's main ally in the Middle East.\n\nBoth Qatar, Kuwait and Egypt have agreed to help with military cooperation, some with the help of local forces. The new agreement goes into effect on Dec.1, said the White House, and there are no issues about the size of oil reserves, so some of the Gulf states will keep oil shipments to Gulf countries for at least the next few years, said James Rolfe, the White House spokesman.\n\nThe new agreement was agreed to earlier in the day, where the United States and Israel agreed to set up a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) aimed at tackling terrorism. At the meeting, the nations agreed to provide each country with $4 billion in investment and other assistance over the next two years, according to the White House.","token_len":321,"entropy":[8.6095,6.0909,1.2027,7.9461,2.8663,8.1961,0.1314,0.1106,3.0794,3.7287,0.0001,0.7706,2.7788,1.0646,4.0116,0.0202,3.2988,2.9573,1.2789,1.2656,5.7236,3.3562,0.3171,2.0653,1.9931,1.4437,5.4386,3.6313,3.2033,2.5663,2.161,6.1733,3.818,0.7714,9.6638,2.1595,6.0002,2.0015,3.2107,4.0609,3.8254,1.7867,2.9577,5.6059,4.6593,3.8259,2.3027,1.4822,1.0576,2.7986,3.8797,1.7322,2.0179,3.963,2.1411,1.5019,0.0057,0.9728,6.3919,0.2506,0.2406,2.6738,1.6025,4.609,6.0424,0.0207,1.1244,2.7574,1.8347,2.3942,2.2592,3.2499,1.7911,1.6233,3.7733,5.2857,0.0592,5.0121,4.3505,2.9509,5.2888,0.6832,0.2299,0.2642,4.8744,1.9548,4.7623,6.1172,0.0817,3.8478,0.4964,0.6722,4.6498,3.7636,3.3251,2.7688,1.0626,3.2355,3.2051,0.5887,1.1629,0.0002,1.9352,3.4301,3.2999,2.9302,5.5565,4.0759,1.9512,1.345,1.5686,0.6959,0.2637,3.6195,5.8495,5.4771,2.3259,1.1896,3.0121,2.6862,2.3136,5.6702,0.8747,1.2781,4.181,5.4138,5.4576,0.7656,6.2479,4.1839,0.0695,2.0736,4.3284,5.6644,4.5135,0.4841,1.3042,1.1388,0.034,1.2048,2.1561,1.4653,3.9161,3.1531,0.0503,5.0759,6.4642,1.2869,1.1564,4.0374,0.0446,2.5187,5.2733,3.4141,2.2278,1.9162,0.0174,3.0646,0.8515,0.9886,1.3522,0.0155,1.6737,0.0077,1.2531,0.5355,0.0002,5.7131,2.4583,3.5362,3.8976,0.3795,0.3453,1.3176,3.7681,0.4223,4.7147,3.861,3.7421,3.7612,1.5229,5.8784,3.791,1.2204,1.6094,0.0055,4.7162,2.9672,1.328,2.0181,4.4542,1.5094,5.3105,0.3022,0.0198,1.3344,0.5377,0.0039,8.1825,1.181,4.1818,2.1326,5.5406,0.0015,1.537,2.1903,4.7005,1.4495,0.7486,5.3532,3.502,1.9274,4.8142,0.2502,6.3937,1.8107,2.2026,5.7875,5.8753,1.9677,0.3428,3.1558,0.8409,1.3279,4.7954,3.589,3.4845,1.3908,4.4396,1.3863,3.0347,2.82,0.0064,1.863,0.1339,2.0873,0.1035,1.7412,2.8304,4.4875,2.9859,5.5921,0.572,0.083,2.2955,1.3387,0.0017,0.5581,0.1357,0.2882,0.0002,1.5702,2.7009,0.7945,3.2924,3.6323,1.1175,4.9771,1.7547,0.3321,1.1712,1.4511,6.2966,1.77,2.8033,0.2602,1.2214,4.9271,1.3224,0.4676,4.286,0.245,0.6938,3.9041,2.0733,0.0247,0.0037,0.0028,2.0227,0.026,0.0024,0.0008,0.7789,3.8684,0.0139,4.757,1.9676,1.5965,5.5684,0.4395,1.9352,0.451,1.6846,5.4695,0.945,0.5345,4.0805,4.107,3.5144,0.2662,1.9119,3.5017,0.5339,0.9675,5.7928,2.0283,2.5702,1.0123,3.3574,0.4137,0.0592,2.1613,0.0964,1.0426,2.0189,0.0012,1.027,0.5914,0.0018,0.2309]}

A week into his second term, Obama also discussed Jerusalem alongside his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu.In response to the Washington Post report that Trump has indicated he will recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital without a formal U.N. declaration of a state, Abbas said he will speak with both sides to discuss the issue.But the Israeli leader also denied any plans to seek the U.S. ambassador's resignation, saying he is \"not in favour of having such an envoy\" on his administration, adding that \"it is not in our interests.\"He further said he hopes President Donald Trump will sign a declaration of emergency, calling for the \"assistance of the United States Government\" to ensure the country \"is prepared to respond in the international community and provide adequate political, financial, and diplomatic support for the Palestinian people in their struggle for a state of their own.\"","token_len":322,"entropy":[7.8534,1.7902,0.9026,3.7396,2.2556,3.2461,1.6964,10.4185,3.1275,1.333,4.6244,0.0511,5.0897,0.9537,3.0597,0.6231,6.1865,0.1175,6.1251,4.3678,6.8517,10.4741,9.4915,6.8597,0.2309,3.3919,1.296,0.903,0.0009,0.0081,0.0252,1.5335,1.2627,2.9215,1.355,0.1013,2.1442,2.3636,4.2562,1.6071,4.2461,0.2237,2.978,2.3012,0.4765,4.2557,1.7995,1.27,2.2348,0.6063,3.7623,5.4078,0.9205,1.235,1.096,1.9971,2.3004,0.4559,4.4983,3.7456,0.7757,0.0003,0.0115,0.0299,1.2478,2.6012,0.6135,1.0331,0.0567,0.3741,1.0203,3.1902,3.7904,3.5335,0.6026,1.5166,4.2313,5.6565,3.5286,0.4621,2.2096,0.0003,2.7794,1.1469,4.6498,0.6299,4.6287,3.2128,1.1959,0.0419,0.9142,0.7369,4.3242,2.491,4.0852,3.249,5.1715,3.256,4.7586,0.7757,4.9662,2.3349,4.7075,2.958,2.0561,3.1095,1.4763,3.5925,2.9732,0.5937,4.4426,1.1581,0.8795,3.524,0.3438,6.5419,1.4173,3.8054,3.0089,5.1824,2.1068,3.3397,0.0189,0.4706,0.2647,3.8128,4.6481,3.1648,0.7351,4.5095,0.2398,0.0025,1.7817,4.7593,3.3101,5.3648,0.5003,1.2085,1.2268,4.313,3.187,3.4772,4.3334,0.9644,3.2616,2.5871,4.5813,0.5243,4.4969,4.0894,5.5023,0.4439,4.9149,0.1889,0.3176,0.6176,3.9324,5.4721,2.3342,7.3407,2.9275,2.1439,0.0813,1.2409,0.3877,0.0012,0.8315,3.5967,3.8643,0.3809,1.6868,4.638,0.2459,0.9922,1.6222,0.6991,3.7277,4.4572,0.8626,1.6874,4.8413,0.1023,0.1483,0.3981,0.0078,0.0093,5.7774,2.5903,1.8807,2.1209,0.0003,2.4678,0.0176,2.2709,2.0681,2.0048,0.5017,0.2924,0.3427,0.5614,2.1868,3.2133,5.2223,0.9182,4.558,2.3829,2.4467,2.7024,0.8204,0.6867,0.4676,4.377,2.4227,3.37,1.0011,2.3117,4.66,2.7079,2.755,0.3395,4.7764,3.6936,1.164,0.0003,0.2002,0.0892,4.0214,0.8253,0.7209,1.609,0.6906,1.8035,2.5576,2.2565,1.9401,3.2224,4.5013,0.7242,4.8232,4.2994,1.3443,3.4074,2.6291,3.2338,2.1271,4.4793,3.5124,3.053,0.4517,2.4501,2.4572,0.903,1.6466,2.3725,1.4388,1.612,2.1309,3.3844,5.1404,0.9113,1.6603,4.8235,5.3026,2.4207,0.0315,0.9245,4.5849,1.3165,4.2846,0.6655,5.8681,3.3882,3.9538,1.189,1.4758,3.8208,5.355,0.7926,0.5579,1.4989,1.4934,0.0886,5.4936,2.4254,1.1469,3.1869,1.3562,3.8113,3.1417,2.3141,2.1458,0.5105,2.4552,2.6158,2.0548,3.9359,1.2018,3.0236,5.6858,5.5106,5.4926,1.1857,2.9363,0.8158,0.8372,1.8161,0.4442,1.9842,0.7449,1.6825,1.0218,2.9819,1.3239,1.3521,0.641,1.8903,0.4096,0.6624,0.2748,0.4076,0.3225]}

The contract allows Connecticut Department of Labor President Jim Ritter and Treasurer David Ritter to collect a higher-than-expected salary, a pay rise and other benefits from unions that support the deal. Connecticut House Speaker Nicholas J. Farrar agreed to meet with state lawmakers Monday and will unveil his budget early Tuesday, according to House Government Reform Committee chairman John A. Horsley. The deal will save the state about $1.1 billion over 10 years, Mr. LeVine said. \"I do see a lot of opportunity here in terms of going long-term,\" he said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nNo details have been provided as to whether the $7.9-billion contract could trigger a ballot initiative or what will happen with unions, but there's a suggestion the legislation would reduce pension benefits, so some of the money won't go to hospitals.

The charges against Bela Kovacs, leader of the Party in the Hungarian minority government group, are the fourth to be laid because of the activities of the Foreign Intelligence Service, which is the main security-policy agency for NATO member Hungary.\n\nThe charges include conspiracy to falsify personal and financial history of a victim after coming to the United States to collect information on an alleged Russian hacking plot to undermine European politics. Kovacs was arrested along with his four assistants last month after being stopped by Internal Revenue Service agents in Chicago who were seeking a review of his identity because they were looking for Russian interference into the election with an interest in Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThe charges are also related to investigations into claims that a government hacker in China sent more than $13 billion worth of malicious code into the Swiss Federal Credit Union and the Bank of Italy.\n\nBela Kovacs, a member of the Jobbik Party, made some of the comments about his alleged involvement in the hacking, said in a television interview carried on Spanish news networks.\n\nKovacs was suspended last May after his deputy, Duda Kalay, said in a radio interview that he was the source of the hacks, which turned public on June 4. He had denied any wrongdoing, said Kalay, who has been the main political target of the Russian propaganda machine RT, which the FBI is seeking to bring to justice, following that incident as well.","token_len":323,"entropy":[12.1789,8.1683,3.9567,1.0366,3.7883,6.8903,0.0108,0.409,4.2371,5.6859,4.138,0.0051,0.0024,0.2419,2.5724,2.0768,3.2208,0.2352,5.6694,1.1576,4.5525,2.2093,5.1106,4.1968,6.693,1.6355,5.748,0.4213,1.0305,1.9757,0.1194,3.8477,1.5392,2.6327,7.2817,2.6545,2.9318,1.8624,0.8792,4.5681,0.0056,0.7242,5.4033,4.4921,0.9973,3.5763,4.702,3.0301,6.2515,0.8029,2.0645,1.5522,4.6975,3.0652,0.4292,3.2823,7.505,0.4739,1.6939,5.4476,0.3776,1.1204,5.6668,0.7177,0.1529,1.4779,1.757,1.7426,3.6335,1.3441,4.5337,4.5213,5.2677,1.5365,1.1755,5.2933,2.4503,2.1921,0.2039,0.9417,0.0002,1.8565,1.5189,3.8351,4.1943,0.2368,5.3862,0.0044,5.7274,2.9502,1.0272,7.478,1.4823,1.6395,5.7481,7.0017,6.2871,0.6197,0.9661,0.836,0.0777,2.0385,3.6505,1.1431,0.6669,3.6439,1.6417,2.4683,3.8133,4.9362,2.188,2.8222,3.1832,4.3736,1.1114,1.9735,0.0114,1.9787,1.6384,5.0274,0.0077,1.9123,5.7485,4.0517,2.9757,1.446,1.8703,3.1127,4.4087,1.1284,5.9031,1.1355,0.0067,0.2899,1.4522,5.1635,4.8007,2.6923,3.8713,3.2189,5.4009,0.0919,0.8647,4.1303,5.2976,1.6069,1.8086,2.7221,0.2445,3.9187,4.9712,5.2852,0.4801,1.621,7.3625,3.377,2.9862,0.0295,5.0365,1.3131,5.5884,0.7039,0.6355,0.1864,0.408,0.0002,1.7232,2.4243,2.4359,3.4917,1.5253,0.0179,5.6203,0.4642,4.6597,0.8548,2.8707,5.3222,6.1512,3.4512,4.49,4.3144,4.0871,0.0259,1.8253,5.5065,1.8616,1.719,0.0013,5.6082,2.09,2.2338,0.6468,5.1728,3.2636,3.1107,0.0075,2.6336,2.0582,3.3989,0.0956,3.9024,1.7872,0.97,0.0002,4.6809,2.7792,0.1316,0.0061,0.911,1.9543,1.6848,0.0029,0.4791,1.1564,0.0014,0.0018,2.1565,0.9903,5.5523,6.9244,1.2133,0.4489,3.6763,3.1863,3.1446,3.0718,2.309,0.3595,0.643,1.2941,2.2464,3.4312,3.0469,0.6025,5.0188,0.0713,5.568,3.1704,5.0216,2.4088,3.8619,0.803,0.6546,0.0002,3.4195,0.027,0.0062,2.1263,5.3564,3.5022,3.9929,0.8541,2.9467,4.5248,1.1723,4.9989,3.9547,5.5574,4.1239,1.8334,2.9591,2.2293,0.6932,3.5157,0.0926,0.371,1.0384,1.4233,4.0684,2.4834,0.1285,0.7619,3.8826,1.9821,1.3292,5.7953,5.063,2.7986,2.8354,3.064,0.5093,2.7356,2.9894,2.6927,1.6769,1.3884,2.1971,4.3623,0.7467,0.0007,0.7373,0.6467,2.4889,1.4325,4.2324,4.1846,3.3245,2.6605,0.1095,0.9226,4.0247,5.4366,2.2,4.5886,2.0067,1.0848,4.5064,4.0663,1.9217,3.4018,0.2671,4.5943,0.5497,0.0548,4.4546,5.6597,6.4269,3.2267,6.982,0.4324,0.7498]}

Unemployment fell last month after the recession hit, although it is rising again next month.

My position is this is an election year, and we're going to work hard over the next two months to reform that,\" Harper said.","token_len":323,"entropy":[6.2232,4.3871,5.0122,1.225,3.604,3.6458,3.4535,0.0533,2.8058,3.4817,0.0195,4.5464,3.7263,1.9661,3.0282,2.156,3.6185,13.02,12.1181,3.8482,2.04,5.2692,1.8666,3.3889,6.5476,1.9711,6.2829,0.3023,0.1312,0.0,0.3552,0.0165,11.1397,0.4798,3.0458,2.2985,0.0853,0.7358,3.1354,4.7245,2.4396,4.8959,0.0143,4.0654,3.456,1.8306,4.6268,2.2007,1.3849,0.202,0.1708,0.0003,1.125,3.9251,5.5342,2.3425,2.284,0.2269,3.0849,1.4983,0.9775,0.9299,1.3348,2.4941,3.3548,0.221,5.3818,1.9405,4.7487,3.4992,0.9682,2.3968,2.4042,1.1702,0.66,3.7583,0.1169,4.7881,5.0333,2.9986,2.4761,5.5963,0.5194,3.4213,0.0005,0.0017,0.0973,2.7951,0.0522,0.6091,0.8453,5.1185,2.246,1.6861,0.4829,0.0002,1.1915,4.6047,4.2372,0.4017,0.6117,4.7602,6.3546,0.1561,3.7915,1.3149,2.8204,3.4578,2.1516,0.3819,0.0337,0.8891,2.5101,4.3862,2.0397,5.4851,0.0612,3.5998,2.2746,2.4812,2.1142,4.0614,4.8801,1.099,0.3091,4.2442,2.9595,6.2514,0.1503,2.3228,1.421,6.1555,2.1659,4.9059,0.002,4.3983,4.3989,1.1188,0.3085,0.0002,3.5705,3.4931,0.0225,5.6705,0.0008,1.7235,0.0007,0.7503,3.7821,0.615,5.845,0.1744,5.4104,0.054,1.4032,2.0628,2.1517,0.2041,0.9646,1.0393,4.5131,0.3125,3.8774,4.2387,4.4484,3.8405,1.3738,2.5641,5.4944,2.4612,0.0248,0.0144,0.3533,0.2956,0.0002,3.6691,4.5067,4.2123,0.6096,0.8972,0.9655,4.9981,3.3855,3.7718,0.9812,1.5933,3.1359,0.0006,0.0092,0.3237,3.096,2.655,1.4504,3.6783,1.6137,4.5878,3.5007,3.0983,1.1925,3.1209,1.4741,0.8311,3.4287,2.3816,3.5825,2.087,0.8026,2.0969,5.2109,1.2044,0.9053,0.8193,0.2255,5.1217,3.4815,4.1739,3.0063,4.2561,0.8631,0.6353,1.5008,1.5966,1.0077,1.2672,0.789,5.0914,6.2227,2.6357,1.4018,6.0551,0.0139,1.701,4.1544,0.7983,0.1268,0.0002,5.3895,1.8898,5.1739,1.7489,5.3064,2.0495,3.0705,0.5479,4.811,1.9112,2.9838,3.9422,3.4525,5.4331,5.1229,0.1428,0.794,2.7333,0.5395,1.9773,1.7232,1.6907,3.7848,0.0688,0.5933,0.7095,0.28,5.6189,1.033,1.5213,1.1691,2.8759,4.2866,0.5191,3.0044,0.0014,1.5676,6.1614,5.3931,7.7539,5.021,4.9089,3.1486,1.3358,2.9079,0.0718,2.7582,0.4988,0.1322,0.0003,0.8721,3.6364,1.5179,2.905,3.6978,0.6708,1.0928,1.5631,5.5912,5.1056,0.2988,3.2138,0.6966,2.7625,5.6321,0.9247,2.1247,0.9742,1.7766,1.5835,0.7696,0.035,3.9879,2.1273,6.0921,0.2803,0.3087,2.4181,2.152,0.2202,4.9051,3.7795,1.5172,1.1353,0.2641,0.6507]}

Bob Goodlatte (VA), the head of the House Budget Committee, said he was unsure whether there would be enough votes for a funding bill to increase the program. \"One way to find out is we'll work the same way Republicans did in passing the Affordable Care Act,\" he said.","token_len":324,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.2998,0.4341,0.0098,3.0383,2.4398,1.9176,2.0649,1.4924,6.8363,3.4807,3.7797,7.6259,0.9585,1.661,5.7691,0.0468,5.3629,0.0777,0.0718,4.9709,2.1568,4.8298,0.0225,1.872,2.9344,5.1476,4.0124,7.4713,3.8846,3.8759,6.4466,2.4491,1.9533,4.7823,0.2057,5.1497,1.6464,1.071,1.9154,0.0599,0.2437,6.2433,1.6576,2.512,1.0441,1.5481,3.2217,1.6182,4.8905,0.4583,1.1214,2.1997,5.0831,2.6973,2.0108,0.5943,5.67,0.7729,2.8242,3.7491,1.4538,6.509,2.2675,6.2555,0.0423,0.2092,1.8843,4.7982,0.9122,4.4367,0.3521,5.6272,2.6275,1.4783,0.9828,5.458,3.9597,1.701,4.1811,0.1414,0.7585,0.4887,3.3095,1.7629,0.8205,0.0003,4.0164,0.1523,2.3455,0.0003,1.0779,5.7279,0.974,1.52,4.639,1.7552,6.0062,2.7475,2.3064,4.567,1.0114,1.1307,0.8244,5.1019,1.2176,3.5848,5.9991,0.3764,4.3235,0.8596,4.6182,0.3941,5.0335,2.1461,3.044,3.5667,1.2204,1.0751,1.6491,2.4779,5.051,1.7722,2.5859,1.5379,1.844,0.83,2.0037,1.6079,1.2789,2.1331,5.7363,0.4885,0.2278,1.954,0.1755,0.3079,0.0003,0.6268,1.0518,1.8315,4.1812,0.7944,3.4867,1.2238,5.1494,3.3272,2.0474,7.1501,1.0694,2.3742,5.6922,3.9435,5.301,2.9328,1.3696,1.7433,0.0177,2.3612,1.9861,3.2052,4.1051,3.7253,1.4507,0.2748,0.4975,0.4542,0.0003,3.8937,5.4047,6.0024,0.67,3.4699,1.143,3.4202,1.1309,2.3573,4.3328,1.2177,2.6682,0.0099,4.8908,3.1381,2.1468,0.6797,2.9682,0.0005,0.0009,0.0686,5.6109,2.5907,0.0027,4.822,0.0398,2.8088,3.3889,3.3249,1.3367,3.8789,2.4626,0.4077,0.0086,1.7664,2.1138,1.9491,1.4031,0.0039,0.1934,2.6349,1.862,0.0344,0.0014,0.312,0.5839,0.0002,1.3477,4.324,1.3805,0.1551,0.3056,2.1236,1.4009,6.2872,0.0039,3.5617,1.0736,0.257,3.2667,5.5748,2.2137,1.538,1.0782,0.2302,3.3995,0.3743,2.999,3.8492,1.3021,0.2165,0.6707,1.686,4.5621,0.7761,0.2598,0.4226,2.2464,5.5381,1.5161,4.8237,4.3517,1.4959,5.3213,1.1055,1.9403,1.4992,0.1599,0.0002,3.9395,3.7046,2.9468,0.0025,4.0475,0.2921,0.0007,0.0,1.0772,0.6322,1.0971,1.7089,4.5573,0.0032,0.0513,0.4797,1.9787,0.0181,0.1126,0.4871,1.3729,1.3363,3.4006,1.7859,4.1961,0.4898,0.0538,2.0901,1.3964,2.1898,1.4899,2.3111,0.1652,1.0222,4.3284,0.6453,2.8168,0.7083,2.838,5.8201,2.6327,1.085,4.25,0.8336,0.9564,4.3214,1.7127,4.3778,5.8067,4.1431,1.2013,5.4921,1.4323,2.1974,5.3303,0.69,0.8402,0.0025,0.0005,0.6795,0.3042,0.1431,0.1836]}

It also says it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nLast week, the U.S. supreme court ordered the U.S. Department of Justice to start enforcing the city's sanctuary law.

As those who have remained silent in history, today can be remembered by many as having not only given a living, but made a difference.\nIt is this spirit which will set this great nation apart now.\nWe will do our best to be free.\nThank you, God Bless Venezuela, we hope we will speak the same word over and over again.\nAnd that's as clear as day.\nThank you.","token_len":325,"entropy":[5.314,2.1988,12.1849,3.8396,5.2722,8.4904,0.6153,6.4934,3.0068,3.9284,5.6796,0.2205,9.305,2.155,3.2249,4.0252,0.1821,2.9234,3.6165,5.3036,1.9195,1.1408,2.8195,2.2369,0.5103,3.127,2.1084,9.5065,1.5224,4.7948,6.1645,0.3463,1.3668,7.4534,3.4009,6.448,0.0142,0.4507,5.3693,3.069,2.0581,6.2558,2.9165,3.2383,1.1821,0.7762,0.0089,4.2572,1.2634,4.5284,2.5757,6.7803,5.4289,0.8108,0.8812,4.9202,2.0032,5.2301,1.2865,0.0008,3.8921,2.2817,4.0037,0.7581,4.4212,3.7256,0.3869,0.9379,3.7598,2.2352,1.9383,3.3853,1.9125,1.7812,1.2597,1.5104,1.5609,2.5218,3.6941,2.8153,4.534,2.023,2.6442,0.9448,11.324,2.9846,5.0974,1.3613,3.4755,5.7498,4.0168,0.0523,4.3801,5.118,5.4754,2.2552,2.9225,5.8656,2.1662,2.5573,3.9793,1.2859,2.55,4.2728,0.4011,2.637,1.8592,1.3556,1.8535,1.951,5.0256,1.7912,2.5046,3.8478,0.96,1.393,1.5956,2.7173,5.2917,0.0057,1.7989,5.6327,1.4433,3.7146,1.3502,2.4368,3.5739,1.9773,5.0342,1.3296,4.7996,5.8787,1.889,3.4745,3.2306,2.5627,1.6353,0.1114,0.8767,0.9247,3.9274,1.7674,6.1828,2.3391,0.0073,0.8702,2.4368,2.5976,3.9611,1.4161,5.3996,1.4939,4.7775,5.7304,4.7751,0.3396,4.8786,2.44,0.226,6.0288,1.1732,2.3985,4.0496,0.2401,3.4883,0.8963,1.5484,2.2862,5.2615,5.4511,5.8712,1.0812,2.1513,3.2729,2.9406,0.3296,0.5454,2.2613,4.2073,6.131,4.2281,1.5713,3.5322,0.0102,3.4832,3.7896,2.7378,3.5678,4.063,0.8955,0.659,6.5149,0.8851,1.2593,5.5364,2.0292,0.1724,0.7617,2.4269,3.1154,5.635,0.4325,2.9144,2.4806,2.5224,0.8543,3.7141,5.8786,1.2195,3.1818,1.7244,1.3229,5.2613,4.1722,0.5629,2.7967,0.7626,0.4775,5.3841,0.6308,2.1936,5.0883,1.1127,2.6062,6.5265,2.7607,4.7247,0.8472,1.9045,2.7956,4.7787,4.7502,2.7107,2.4984,1.9601,2.2014,1.2384,0.7931,4.6145,4.9845,0.355,1.193,2.2685,0.1471,1.5473,5.1836,0.6596,5.3176,5.1498,1.0538,3.3992,3.2113,2.753,1.3828,6.8628,4.4534,0.7993,4.0792,2.5013,4.6449,1.2242,0.0931,3.646,0.516,2.0684,0.6478,0.5871,3.5571,0.5832,4.4048,3.8137,3.8119,2.2874,5.2207,3.1726,5.3686,0.9031,2.3104,6.9861,0.9496,0.8107,2.9001,1.9728,4.3345,2.1436,0.3982,0.2865,4.4332,5.7917,2.2207,1.0524,4.2247,0.0422,1.9568,4.3218,2.0258,1.5322,1.5307,5.1795,2.7753,3.929,1.7932,4.8373,4.1591,2.2623,3.3593,5.5768,0.2459,0.0052,0.1244,0.4982,0.719,3.654,3.8749,2.2948,6.4722,6.3523,0.2204,1.182,0.6684,0.9341,3.6612,0.051,2.5097]}

I am not just going to continue to put our resources where our lives go, and I think we're going to work together to ensure this sort of positive response is put into place,\" she said.","token_len":327,"entropy":[10.1419,1.0524,7.7656,0.0002,1.8431,2.9868,1.9568,2.6768,3.9392,4.3354,13.44,8.8879,8.0385,10.908,0.3317,7.1071,0.0217,0.1168,0.1422,1.7083,0.1537,0.0068,5.7624,5.543,0.0062,6.5382,1.549,1.5125,3.1459,6.1703,0.0545,0.0172,1.2055,2.6865,3.925,2.4646,0.6889,1.7938,5.8682,4.3171,7.6705,2.1951,6.6822,5.821,1.0719,4.9263,3.3164,2.8434,1.4138,1.3858,4.6143,5.2955,1.6314,2.1241,1.7907,0.7098,2.7605,0.0318,2.0932,2.0522,3.2972,3.2978,5.6957,1.9369,3.6427,2.5898,3.0517,4.9394,2.2405,4.4436,5.7355,0.3708,5.8825,0.4735,5.5512,1.2271,4.0963,2.3621,4.123,2.0766,2.7167,2.1245,1.1072,1.5551,2.3464,1.2563,0.0004,2.2656,0.0243,5.9518,2.1864,0.4444,4.4838,2.3368,6.1266,2.9261,6.1136,1.4138,5.9027,5.3501,3.8034,2.8963,1.4399,4.2579,3.6506,2.9555,1.2852,0.0006,0.1833,0.0459,1.7483,1.8257,4.6716,1.8956,0.0049,1.1947,4.4684,0.9306,1.2691,2.4883,2.2163,6.0661,0.597,5.2541,0.1571,2.0079,3.9424,5.3852,0.1025,3.0552,3.9153,2.2193,0.3608,3.229,2.6708,1.7447,1.1005,0.2428,0.0006,0.0049,0.0592,4.7582,4.0701,0.3362,1.6191,0.8376,0.5831,0.9176,2.1805,4.2483,1.3497,4.695,0.8113,2.4167,2.241,2.1959,5.3265,2.9359,5.1798,1.5908,1.3245,4.0522,0.5396,0.9287,1.6608,1.0102,6.8697,3.6734,0.8295,1.6648,2.0728,0.2332,0.1619,0.3108,0.0003,2.3687,0.0063,1.414,1.7176,1.9435,2.8622,2.7662,5.6889,4.1604,0.2686,3.3932,4.2706,0.0373,2.8067,2.7164,2.2324,5.5956,0.4507,2.6784,1.2714,1.6588,3.4166,5.5109,4.8264,0.38,1.8581,1.778,2.4767,3.9606,0.001,0.0494,0.1277,1.7075,2.0616,4.3012,3.5074,3.1516,2.7823,4.6077,5.7349,1.4759,2.8621,0.4226,3.8432,2.1665,1.4738,0.0625,3.0273,3.8989,3.0051,1.8059,2.0222,2.2709,1.1378,2.6387,0.7952,0.7281,1.4289,0.1239,4.0272,0.403,3.364,1.2412,6.3344,2.8103,0.0008,4.966,3.5536,2.9173,2.9598,2.6945,2.2624,2.463,0.8565,4.4235,0.3587,1.264,2.703,0.3939,1.7123,2.9296,4.8246,7.1073,3.0201,3.6559,1.421,2.8191,0.882,3.3464,4.7112,0.9236,1.1472,3.1098,1.8425,0.2268,0.3016,0.0003,1.9082,1.7379,2.5326,5.8791,0.1188,4.7045,1.8591,6.2913,0.2432,6.1234,1.3438,5.1781,0.0221,1.6063,1.1017,3.4895,1.997,3.7039,2.7294,0.0463,4.6906,0.5903,4.7755,2.5893,2.4176,2.9847,0.2865,4.5316,3.9191,1.3773,2.7586,1.1821,1.8928,1.6066,2.1371,0.9385,0.007,3.8442,1.8314,1.1581,3.7757,2.7898,4.9067,0.0007,5.6998,3.608,1.3064,4.627,1.9953,0.159,1.1309,0.3305,0.2257,0.1429]}

State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement that the agency has only requested that the Post send the documents \"in appropriate circumstances.\"\n\n\"Although our investigation has been ongoing, we are pleased the Agency has complied with this law-enforcement request that the agency seeks to pursue through appropriate legal channels,\" Nauert said.","token_len":331,"entropy":[3.7752,11.0464,3.0504,2.2017,6.179,2.7292,0.166,0.1494,1.695,9.8501,0.6503,2.5456,2.1454,3.7122,1.2798,3.0328,0.0005,0.0009,14.5022,9.5439,8.258,8.9169,1.2088,1.0576,5.702,3.1503,3.9663,8.0582,1.0522,6.8857,2.7514,2.3866,4.1514,5.0387,0.0813,1.0699,5.2027,1.8127,5.3123,1.4497,2.3596,4.1575,3.2511,1.6623,0.0013,2.0477,0.8154,1.3377,4.9384,0.2268,5.5528,4.6622,2.1258,5.5668,3.9391,1.1052,4.9718,0.0091,0.0031,0.0309,1.7964,0.6068,0.3096,4.1801,3.2,5.585,1.7895,1.4129,2.6281,2.4143,2.1727,0.1324,0.2028,0.4293,0.5173,0.0003,2.1582,0.0998,3.5813,0.0003,0.5115,0.0457,0.0721,0.1807,1.0709,1.3159,1.5713,1.3023,0.7086,0.0491,0.8025,0.1853,1.3555,5.5892,5.1271,0.6755,1.48,4.475,5.3316,0.7396,3.9373,0.3958,0.9517,3.1373,4.6379,0.0544,2.3814,2.2614,5.5426,1.222,4.5684,3.9813,2.2516,4.0822,2.1371,2.6798,3.2107,5.5375,0.6211,0.57,1.4603,0.8755,2.7889,2.5932,1.762,0.3303,0.1513,0.0511,0.2101,0.0002,6.4847,1.3014,0.1377,4.1042,0.9278,0.8094,0.1538,0.9811,1.8603,3.8337,1.293,1.3245,0.6719,3.6654,1.8484,4.2266,3.8316,3.975,1.1664,3.3612,0.5045,0.0711,4.1973,1.7333,4.5068,2.1407,1.6414,0.0009,0.0011,2.5172,3.525,2.5072,1.3599,6.2673,5.9514,2.6282,0.8751,4.4442,1.2319,3.5546,2.6216,2.5521,4.54,1.4255,3.7195,1.0987,1.8053,0.0007,0.0153,0.267,3.3996,0.0061,1.9343,0.3487,0.0002,1.4235,4.1007,1.7924,1.6874,0.2918,0.5334,0.1776,0.4885,1.9696,2.8628,0.5689,1.6444,0.8412,2.7571,1.6151,2.9859,0.0081,3.5593,4.8058,0.0581,5.2561,5.2376,1.0148,1.611,0.5612,0.0253,0.467,4.2407,2.7615,0.0003,0.0014,0.0227,1.5587,0.765,6.7049,1.7879,5.0173,0.4042,1.2245,0.5287,0.0002,6.0624,4.8683,0.0375,1.3939,1.9574,1.5269,5.058,0.1816,1.0008,1.5098,0.4648,0.025,0.038,0.8826,0.0827,0.9767,3.1928,3.6783,0.633,1.4553,2.5996,2.2123,3.565,2.2739,0.379,2.8825,3.0305,1.1423,2.0958,4.7237,5.1832,1.2741,0.4005,5.581,0.2519,2.6353,5.1424,0.7122,0.822,7.8369,0.2157,1.0636,1.0196,0.0008,0.0003,1.0715,1.6799,0.2674,0.0651,0.5558,0.8693,1.0882,2.1715,6.1333,5.0532,2.2931,0.8708,3.7638,5.4235,1.3434,1.8231,3.0503,1.7792,4.8992,2.3947,0.4708,0.1087,0.0002,1.8334,5.7727,3.3221,2.005,1.701,0.989,0.2356,0.4111,1.1772,1.8756,4.3154,3.1158,3.9628,0.6092,5.3721,0.3658,3.212,6.897,2.8296,0.2835,0.3079,5.6505,3.0501,3.0662,4.311,0.9489,4.5145,4.2708,2.6078,2.3211,0.6703,0.2702,1.2312,0.0002,0.0989,0.2531]}

{"id":3659,"ended":false,"length":316,"gen_text":"One Afghan and three Turkish teachers linked to an organization regarded with suspicion by the Turkish government were detained by Afghan intelligence officials on Tuesday, the organization s head said. The move against the teachers came after a report by the Turkish government stating that many of them had been targeted because of ties with the al-Qaeda group. \"We are trying to gather the evidence,\" Sedi said. When asked if there had been an attempt to assassinate the four teachers or if all four were tied to the al Qaeda group, Sedi answered: \"Yes, because he wanted to kill them.\" A senior foreign ministry official said the officials have been detained in connection with the Turkish investigation. The four teachers were members of the Kabbaleri Party and had received \"inadvertently\" aid from the state through an online exchange, officials said. The Turkish government did not confirm reports that another government group in Afghanistan had helped raise $13 million for them, but it said it would work with Turkey and the FBI to gather the evidence, as well as provide a \"strong statement\" to Turkish officials, according to a statement from the ministry.\n\nSedi, who is serving a six-year sentence on charges of terrorism, said the Turkish government officials \"are really trying to destroy your life\" as they attempt to use their political clout to keep the teachers in place. The Afghan government is pushing Turkey to extradite the four teachers, which have been detained repeatedly, after the group gained notoriety for helping to kill members of the Pakistani Taliban and other jihadists in Afghanistan in 2008. They have never been charged with any wrongdoing.\n\n(By Robert Costa and David Albright-Eisenberg)","token_len":336,"entropy":[11.9699,4.8408,3.4033,5.0962,8.2498,8.6053,0.231,4.9363,3.5771,10.6737,5.9392,4.1615,0.5403,1.2056,3.4948,0.4686,2.8564,2.6506,2.1157,4.9273,3.9452,1.4881,1.7097,1.9442,1.2093,2.0635,6.9659,11.0041,8.9582,0.7741,0.3538,2.9869,6.6988,6.0424,0.5887,0.4366,1.4723,1.3517,1.8932,3.4048,1.2202,0.9995,2.6047,1.7319,5.6074,0.2365,5.1192,0.5883,1.5835,0.8002,1.1247,4.3563,4.2973,0.689,4.4523,2.3201,0.9154,4.5887,0.7334,0.369,1.9904,0.5564,4.0772,1.8456,1.5098,3.5409,0.069,5.1137,2.6752,1.9275,2.4826,3.7917,4.2289,2.8643,0.482,6.3933,0.8537,1.2133,2.8238,2.1104,0.026,2.5032,1.8821,0.334,4.4895,0.7488,6.2626,0.4076,4.0593,2.9728,5.5071,1.4434,1.2141,4.2182,0.4665,0.6677,2.1359,3.4085,0.7188,0.1031,0.8619,0.0005,3.8616,1.1128,0.017,2.7549,0.726,4.3502,6.1009,4.4999,0.2674,1.2961,1.1245,0.8057,3.8506,2.4074,6.0399,0.513,0.1114,1.0279,1.0936,4.0264,4.3996,0.7852,2.5602,1.8343,1.3415,0.0179,0.6201,4.3803,1.779,0.5344,1.7043,5.1398,0.7965,0.9047,5.0041,0.0015,0.8128,5.2063,5.3481,0.868,3.464,4.9435,2.0476,2.5174,4.2801,4.8374,4.8034,4.1041,0.6926,0.3243,5.5352,0.2861,0.7425,4.8472,3.4051,2.8041,5.0462,4.2772,2.4435,3.3265,0.2192,0.088,1.4336,2.869,0.6847,3.3421,0.0091,3.1112,3.9543,0.6831,6.2221,5.3287,5.4352,4.629,1.6531,1.0026,4.0572,6.0392,4.6714,5.2428,0.2869,0.9038,4.6482,1.741,0.9933,2.3599,1.5852,1.1273,2.8504,3.5825,0.4261,4.3669,2.7873,1.8768,5.4471,0.7184,4.4743,1.8045,0.9153,3.3411,3.3435,0.7877,0.046,3.0619,3.0322,2.9245,3.8126,2.9715,0.6237,1.7199,3.0459,1.3575,2.6506,1.9216,0.0017,1.2071,1.7286,1.1746,0.4446,1.7222,0.2719,2.4735,0.0109,4.7962,0.1785,2.4003,0.8746,1.9579,5.0985,0.6801,2.656,0.0191,0.3206,0.5584,3.0752,1.6551,0.3631,2.7861,1.3538,1.3661,1.5562,2.6118,0.5365,6.3634,3.3649,2.3668,5.2064,1.8042,0.0176,3.9884,5.9164,2.3177,2.5681,3.468,1.514,2.6773,0.0082,5.3257,2.1222,4.2292,1.8786,0.4603,4.6751,1.1755,2.3224,1.7727,4.5811,0.405,2.7052,4.7808,1.6419,2.9092,5.1952,5.5502,0.1952,1.8022,0.0006,0.9179,2.0448,0.4804,1.1455,2.9804,2.8961,0.7217,3.3113,6.171,2.0447,4.2742,1.7727,4.4365,5.6362,1.8523,1.5011,5.2171,1.8842,3.6778,4.711,0.0153,0.7412,4.7559,0.1186,2.2341,1.9398,5.1924,0.8544,0.7289,2.2639,3.5817,0.3384,3.9251,1.8293,4.7023,0.2037,0.5067,0.7316,1.1533,3.3672,1.0183,1.6053,0.0002,5.3722,5.253,5.035,1.8574,0.554,3.2514,2.8792,1.0309,6.7505,5.0263,4.7356,1.1722,1.4042]}

{"id":3642,"ended":true,"length":305,"gen_text":"Russia will keep a naval and an air base in Syria capable of carrying out strikes against insurgents if required after a partial military pull-out announced by President Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin said on Friday.Russian officials have previously expressed doubts that Russia would be able to conduct military strikes against Assad in Syria under any form of international supervision should the situation spiral out of control.But Moscow has not said whether Russia could send troops to Syria, though the Russian defence ministry said Moscow could supply some air and naval forces to rebels.Analysts said Moscow's reluctance might have driven Syria to consider sending forces to combat al Qaeda in the Middle East or the Islamic State group.Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Maria Zakharova said on Saturday that Russia would wait on a list of key countries that might see military aid from the state through an agreement or a negotiated withdrawal from the country.Russian officials said they would be ready to accept military cooperation from some governments but also that they would not give up any hope of taking part in the long-term plan.But, they said, they doubted Moscow would commit to providing Assad any arms.Putin also reiterated Russian support for regional initiatives aimed at fighting Islamic State. Russian warplanes bombed several groups in Syria as part of an April 3 bombing campaign.Russia has deployed ground-attack capability to Syria to counter al Qaeda militants, but its air raids did not defeat the group's ground operations in Syria.Russian airstrikes on Syria were launched on Sunday after U.S.-backed international coalition said they had downed a Russian Sukhoi Su-24 over the Syrian city of Aleppo. The incident caused huge losses to Russian forces that are now working with rebel forces in eastern Syria to regain control of the area.","token_len":341,"entropy":[5.23,5.3744,3.168,8.0475,4.3489,7.049,0.1587,1.6257,0.851,3.5244,8.6135,0.0367,2.9144,0.341,2.9946,1.2179,5.745,5.6716,5.0913,6.4989,2.1125,7.9233,4.4037,7.07,2.2433,0.1294,8.3591,1.1425,1.3427,4.3758,0.0124,2.1845,2.1702,3.5138,0.5887,1.232,1.7661,0.1092,6.3594,2.3696,1.5838,4.1183,3.3032,2.6134,1.5699,2.4526,1.4822,2.8915,0.8497,0.0126,4.1848,2.0195,0.3693,0.8203,2.8865,3.5617,0.4282,4.4041,2.1145,4.3057,0.3191,2.7062,2.5893,6.8783,1.5413,2.8201,6.123,0.1979,0.0051,0.0084,0.3588,3.1265,2.5557,1.2663,3.6215,2.8484,0.9983,2.5547,3.6375,4.1496,2.2517,0.7727,0.3713,2.3208,3.8795,2.2801,2.3282,3.1774,0.0419,0.7599,3.0092,3.2161,4.0089,4.2556,2.6972,2.7567,1.5637,2.1294,1.0502,4.7137,1.649,5.3942,0.0003,1.2355,1.9495,1.4557,3.9535,5.5475,2.0188,5.7976,3.9797,1.5864,3.904,3.4191,3.8067,0.8364,5.1679,4.0264,1.0545,1.8194,0.846,3.6993,0.0123,3.0575,2.8332,0.4724,0.0053,1.2588,1.6252,4.3232,2.58,2.0149,0.5729,1.6749,0.0001,0.0,0.0016,0.4263,1.5028,1.9173,0.5519,1.6881,1.4217,5.4254,3.3057,2.37,4.9411,0.1486,5.4633,2.4112,1.8107,3.18,5.1845,1.8207,3.6198,1.8872,0.9306,6.6812,4.2263,3.7027,2.6646,4.1296,2.1156,4.5526,3.7281,1.7979,0.9194,3.0107,0.9283,3.6882,2.0665,1.5968,1.979,1.7834,3.3373,2.439,0.2382,3.7461,2.6196,5.3582,2.0104,4.7695,5.872,2.9515,3.3787,3.0672,1.4134,0.5916,0.9945,3.7117,1.0789,2.8179,5.7295,0.2773,4.8413,3.184,0.1285,2.2984,5.8289,0.1254,0.7452,3.6867,1.7879,3.5172,4.0137,1.3332,0.6181,0.0713,2.4026,5.474,3.2322,0.369,4.6719,0.5679,3.7503,5.9177,3.281,3.8244,2.0519,4.0982,3.399,3.9639,4.6477,2.3459,0.0534,6.1417,4.7471,2.7339,0.0094,2.7338,1.6812,0.0233,2.3883,4.5187,4.8153,0.0139,3.2603,3.9766,4.88,1.5639,0.3271,4.3814,1.2193,0.0008,1.734,6.6399,5.1402,3.1578,0.2879,2.0294,2.6677,1.3558,4.4024,3.9422,3.1835,4.2882,6.43,1.1245,1.1421,1.7057,1.4666,3.4347,0.0754,3.0404,1.4303,1.3045,3.7918,2.0251,5.5423,4.5039,0.2358,5.3572,0.9966,0.4448,1.5215,4.6995,2.9502,1.4405,1.8841,0.6267,3.6065,3.367,1.928,2.2664,3.3068,3.3515,1.7661,3.9378,2.0377,3.968,0.0003,0.0414,0.7262,1.1752,5.2754,0.9643,4.1845,1.8131,0.894,4.0301,0.8348,1.6682,2.3869,0.0062,0.0002,0.2938,0.0001,0.8218,4.989,1.3249,1.7482,1.1018,0.0054,0.6428,0.6121,2.8719,6.1851,5.2395,4.3213,3.0566,0.9496,2.8813,2.0175,4.1981,2.9372,2.2595,5.647,1.5794,3.6332,1.204,1.7013,2.9772,0.8751,1.4053,4.5231,0.4161,0.4691,0.7392,3.2349,0.4448]}

{"id":1003,"ended":false,"length":310,"gen_text":"The Trump administration on Thursday named a coal industry consultant and strong supporter of the controversial practice of mountaintop mining to head up a U.S. Interior Department agency that oversees mining operations and environmental regulations.\n\nThe move came as Obama appointees on Friday laid out guidance to oversee mining industry regulation under the Department of Energy's Antiquities and the Department of Agriculture to ensure they comply with new regulations. The administration is sending the letters.\n\nThe draft guidance \u2014 which should be ready for public comment during a public hearing in January on the federal agency's proposed rulemaking process \u2014 details how the administration is evaluating the new rules, the White House said. On Friday, the administration had announced that the review would include a \"public health impact assessment\" aimed at assessing long-term risks from mining practices.\n\nIt is not unusual for policy makers to hold more specific meetings while they consider how they will implement legislation or review proposals, an administration official said. But during the presidential campaign, the White House had said the White House would never sign off on new regulations, which would likely have been made less burdensome for industry if those regulations had been finalized earlier.\n\nThat is changing. A 2015 draft from the State Department set a limit of 40,000 tons of waste-free materials per year for a coal industry in order to keep the government's resources stable, which will limit the rate at which new regulations will impact the industry.\n\nNow, there are 40,000 tons per year of coal waste, according to the White House. The latest draft is due to be released as early as Sunday.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen O'Brien; Editing by Kevin Hinchey)","token_len":342,"entropy":[7.6977,0.9163,4.4464,1.7176,5.1859,1.8587,9.0354,2.7335,4.2578,2.4787,10.3823,1.2274,0.0644,1.3604,4.9076,8.5561,0.9327,10.7017,0.0269,0.0226,5.4262,2.4116,2.6342,4.4592,1.544,4.9082,0.0008,0.0198,0.0189,5.6791,0.0519,4.5612,1.3034,2.6621,3.6204,1.3175,3.4252,3.1,1.5957,0.2829,0.204,0.0002,1.7607,3.5595,3.2431,1.3845,4.0018,5.2262,1.517,4.069,2.8909,4.9056,0.2242,6.168,2.1454,5.5013,3.5291,5.3523,3.8403,3.3428,0.7272,4.4246,0.0104,2.1254,0.3426,4.8288,0.0013,1.4637,1.5993,3.5066,0.0045,2.1081,5.1507,2.2298,3.3652,2.4129,0.0175,4.8309,1.8685,1.1732,2.3059,3.8781,2.2319,6.1348,1.8794,4.5382,4.0885,0.107,0.0002,1.532,5.6757,1.5689,5.0078,1.449,5.3789,0.5292,2.734,1.165,1.6114,0.6782,5.4797,2.1072,3.4578,0.5728,2.7095,2.6844,4.6106,1.0244,4.635,1.624,0.206,3.0866,1.3209,1.1196,0.606,0.1683,5.0416,1.5762,1.0916,3.2443,2.4408,4.6827,1.4193,4.3962,1.4597,1.5847,3.7624,2.9038,0.0021,0.1021,0.3296,7.3942,1.7638,0.1035,1.0919,2.0424,4.3985,4.1163,1.2681,1.7757,4.5841,0.7209,2.7294,1.9701,3.0033,4.7958,5.4027,2.3443,0.56,0.6872,5.4356,0.0159,2.4279,6.4124,0.021,0.1892,2.0519,2.754,1.5854,4.2308,0.7262,0.2089,0.0002,4.3963,1.9549,1.6644,4.3925,0.0972,6.0148,1.0316,0.4299,4.9426,5.8113,5.0004,2.6763,5.8914,3.0831,3.9507,4.6934,2.8612,2.0947,2.695,5.483,1.9842,5.8357,4.4676,2.3111,5.0363,1.1898,0.1826,0.2374,0.2284,2.6092,5.9543,1.0477,4.7889,0.7555,0.1266,1.7897,2.0443,0.0019,2.3251,2.5471,1.843,3.5762,0.0031,0.8919,5.2514,3.8318,1.0972,0.008,2.9952,0.8945,1.9282,3.0396,1.7893,3.2764,2.2225,2.9152,4.4681,4.9644,2.82,0.0007,2.7755,3.4455,3.351,4.4714,1.0151,1.0652,0.3969,2.8848,1.9687,0.2933,0.1655,0.0002,4.9055,2.8969,4.2902,0.9615,3.7719,4.6563,3.8824,4.5003,0.4932,5.115,0.0861,5.1801,2.5753,5.2626,0.8273,4.1486,1.4775,0.0273,0.7414,0.4269,5.93,3.2862,4.6025,4.6608,1.003,0.3498,1.868,3.8283,3.3393,2.153,3.2421,3.6916,0.028,3.4725,1.741,3.215,2.0831,3.6405,6.2317,1.9529,4.089,4.0325,4.6302,0.9645,4.2304,1.0842,0.0001,3.1433,0.4344,1.6273,3.9177,1.125,0.6478,0.4146,0.7679,0.0002,5.3191,0.5493,4.7628,0.8394,5.4842,0.0578,0.0082,0.0866,2.2837,0.0309,1.5148,2.3869,1.2269,1.5664,2.1504,0.0011,0.5783,3.7693,0.0052,0.6585,1.8529,5.615,2.1664,3.0579,4.3683,0.6619,0.5179,1.469,4.319,0.8455,0.0125,4.2544,0.7018,0.464,0.0002,5.309,0.9528,0.0811,4.5928,4.7466,0.0944,0.9811,0.4203,0.1284,0.0013,4.7202,4.2213,3.5799,0.0155,0.453]}

A change of that type may be more beneficial later than usual, a White House official said.\n\nThe White House said the executive order was finalized without comment, but it said it would comply with the 2015 executive order by providing more guidance, and there would be a \"fresh update\" to guidance on financial reporting by Jan. 11, if President Trump makes it public.\n\nIt also said that the rules will cover not only some new accounting gimmicks such as the so-called offshore oil deal involving $10 billion in funding, but also \"an accelerated effort to improve processes, which will impact on our compliance with regulatory agencies on these matters.\"\n\nPresident Trump, who was the first to speak at the rally, is already on short notice for a planned meeting in New York, following that of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen O'Donnell; Editing by Mark Heinrich)","token_len":344,"entropy":[7.6977,0.9163,3.1134,5.0719,7.877,3.3974,3.3849,5.1608,0.734,0.0824,2.248,0.5397,7.5905,6.2177,3.4898,4.3604,0.0079,5.1077,0.0012,0.0058,0.3643,8.2758,4.5403,3.2092,6.6358,3.1392,1.9698,7.2109,5.3961,6.1254,4.3418,4.6768,1.9166,6.1572,1.347,2.5593,1.7272,2.1223,3.9956,4.8034,0.4536,1.1997,4.3029,1.6929,2.6552,0.2425,5.5272,2.1409,1.6825,2.2431,1.99,4.1987,3.4768,0.9201,0.9418,3.487,4.9591,1.3996,0.9873,0.8402,3.0882,0.0191,3.0216,4.4558,1.5031,2.8229,2.2553,2.6202,0.2215,1.2563,2.5531,5.8841,4.6671,3.3399,1.8784,2.1134,2.2897,3.7805,1.5732,1.9334,2.5211,0.0965,0.0079,2.5231,1.9052,5.9705,2.0492,5.9562,4.8955,2.6131,3.8896,3.1184,5.2193,0.1306,0.0732,4.9117,1.7928,0.2022,4.8923,3.6167,0.5171,5.9395,5.0155,2.4219,0.7914,1.2416,0.5786,0.0003,1.346,3.5103,0.0011,4.358,1.8361,2.0864,3.712,0.8681,3.4579,1.6138,0.0031,4.0959,0.6936,1.6966,2.2278,2.2072,1.5641,2.2578,0.3131,5.3346,0.2655,3.4982,0.6137,0.7283,5.2561,3.4047,4.365,5.3012,2.2234,5.75,0.002,1.4419,2.8321,7.5074,2.826,3.179,4.855,2.4807,2.5649,2.4175,1.86,3.6282,0.8067,1.2143,2.6462,0.0096,2.3148,3.7208,1.8317,5.716,2.021,5.6619,4.9979,4.7119,2.2563,2.9002,3.1251,5.3981,1.5254,3.9727,4.7246,8.5011,3.9476,5.1427,0.775,4.9011,0.5117,0.0027,0.1349,0.1299,0.4735,0.2461,0.0003,1.2398,2.844,0.0032,1.8327,1.4743,5.5061,0.0949,2.1358,5.4176,4.6446,2.1434,2.3756,1.0902,2.5952,2.0229,0.9587,1.5495,5.0452,0.0307,1.2271,5.43,4.6949,0.1166,3.1151,3.9398,1.9475,2.9975,4.0868,2.3496,5.746,1.4095,0.1355,2.4835,1.6141,5.3169,4.2333,0.6532,1.4739,5.1646,1.8506,4.4669,3.1615,2.2445,4.337,0.1696,5.035,1.6445,4.7383,4.4208,0.9502,3.3706,1.6582,4.7837,0.4514,0.4437,0.0003,4.2746,1.7648,0.5703,1.436,1.1664,3.4613,2.7585,5.2167,5.3464,0.4585,5.4218,4.7595,5.2448,6.0596,0.0014,3.49,0.0008,2.3782,3.6008,0.0032,0.0006,5.8766,5.8151,4.4427,5.4679,4.1656,3.4027,1.064,0.8834,5.4002,2.3392,0.0447,0.5232,2.3993,3.7276,5.0065,5.6443,0.4492,3.3923,5.889,3.4911,5.6423,1.4041,5.797,3.4788,2.2981,3.1765,1.3328,4.0295,4.3508,4.3376,4.3163,1.675,0.958,0.3124,0.0003,5.4247,0.71,3.2087,1.0271,3.3556,5.2295,1.1113,2.0507,4.9763,1.5967,0.4314,5.3813,0.6631,4.3305,4.1089,3.9839,6.3892,0.1021,3.277,2.0068,4.7726,2.2727,3.7795,2.4353,0.1545,3.039,4.9579,6.2563,0.6164,4.4178,0.114,0.0146,0.0051,1.047,1.0747,0.0002,4.4261,0.4668,0.0754,4.4581,4.9092,0.0559,0.9015,0.5371,0.1499,0.0011,3.6373,0.1618,0.0028,0.4158]}

It says there is no change currently under the Obama administration to any financial reporting laws that are being interpreted by regulators in the United States.\n\nIt also said that the rules will not eliminate the burden of reporting a student's loan debt, but instead would prevent banks from providing information to consumers about their credit histories to give the government some clarity on whether their loans were delinquent.\n\nCritics said the administration is using a \"war on consumers\" strategy without any real end goal.

{"id":4820,"ended":false,"length":333,"gen_text":"Germany strongly condemns North Korea s latest ballistic missile test, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said on Wednesday, adding that he would summon North Korea s ambassador. North Korea has again breached international law and its own guidelines in the ICBM test and has put the country on a military collision course. In November, the United States warned North Korea has a 'grave threat' to the United States as it launched a nuclear test with an ICBM over the Korean Peninsula, and warned it would send a signal to its neighbours that the United States will fight back if necessary. Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said North Korea is now likely to carry out a test that will have the largest atomic blast of any warhead ever recorded.\n\nIt would be \"very hard to overstate with certainty\" the seriousness of North Korea's nuclear ambitions because of its military actions, said Gabriel, citing recent UN report that warned China is trying to push the North Korean leadership away from its nuclear program and into a nuclear and long-range missile programme. It would also not be a surprise to the United States who have seen its relationship with the regime through its nuclear programme.\n\n\"With regard to North Korea and its nuclear programme, we should not forget that the DPRK has a nuclear weapon that has a capability to kill or injure humans,\" Gabriel said in an interview with the Swedish Television Network. The incident will set a great change in international relations between the two countries and \"clearly highlight the deep strategic relationship between North Korea and China,\" Gabriel added.\n\n\nHe also said that North Korea is a \"very serious threat to American forces\" and that it will now be better to act \"as a deterrent and as a deterrent to our own forces if necessary.\"","token_len":346,"entropy":[10.2179,4.0742,5.0974,0.187,10.5716,3.1984,2.3826,0.2956,0.3381,1.5876,7.4481,0.5969,6.1394,0.0046,0.0,0.6166,1.305,2.1196,2.1765,3.2881,0.4733,2.9223,2.305,7.7987,3.6899,0.3486,9.4785,2.6152,3.1774,4.8036,0.1021,1.7313,7.7796,7.3998,1.3803,1.0749,1.7976,3.2323,3.4534,5.7101,2.748,2.7184,5.4864,0.0103,0.2383,3.0169,2.0358,5.5767,1.9648,2.0986,0.779,1.214,3.9741,3.3123,0.0084,2.3215,4.6826,5.5159,0.5071,1.4976,1.6251,0.517,3.6767,1.9513,0.0279,7.1284,2.0123,4.1839,3.8509,1.7484,0.4857,1.1761,0.8635,0.8958,0.0312,4.3213,0.7652,4.5255,1.0987,3.407,0.659,4.0369,2.6214,0.5572,0.0022,3.2305,1.2866,0.8576,0.1806,2.3738,2.8375,2.3594,1.6441,1.0354,4.5908,0.9414,2.6802,0.5235,1.812,1.3975,1.5694,2.0941,0.8083,0.0022,2.54,5.7813,2.1096,2.4658,2.4003,0.1391,5.8993,0.331,0.6731,0.0083,0.0183,1.5513,2.8865,0.0212,2.9107,2.558,5.4654,0.0245,3.7665,0.0581,0.8889,2.6622,2.3763,2.4135,3.3768,2.3613,4.3836,6.1067,1.9121,2.0292,1.1027,3.6742,1.137,0.6971,2.8275,0.7824,2.1308,0.0035,5.1161,4.1388,0.912,4.1269,2.8612,2.523,1.0116,5.5204,0.3926,7.4825,1.066,0.8681,1.307,2.4418,0.1198,1.5916,0.0471,0.2888,2.1193,2.2184,4.8189,1.3005,1.3399,4.2013,4.2561,0.8134,1.9808,0.5282,0.6029,5.706,2.4876,5.29,5.6213,1.7389,3.6275,5.2812,3.1415,4.9436,0.0425,4.7461,1.5747,1.8277,2.095,3.0126,3.9396,0.0302,1.3125,0.6006,1.1063,2.1917,2.0503,1.5401,2.5443,5.4162,4.8265,0.1564,0.0104,0.3871,2.3892,0.2056,4.1793,2.2081,0.5474,4.758,0.7362,2.2351,1.2077,1.7091,4.1675,1.9214,0.1865,4.5216,2.4395,2.826,3.3745,3.7212,0.0628,1.6548,3.0467,5.508,2.4958,2.9408,1.7981,1.7581,0.8428,0.0003,1.4092,5.0819,3.6336,0.0102,1.0811,0.0209,3.4642,1.2389,1.3182,0.8606,0.2551,1.5322,3.6922,1.7061,2.1235,0.6921,1.6752,2.9576,1.2853,2.1617,2.1958,2.9919,2.3111,2.9282,1.5438,3.2357,0.903,4.1046,3.7859,1.553,4.7437,1.7511,0.83,0.2293,2.2495,1.8955,0.239,0.5364,1.8541,4.3437,4.4265,2.3108,0.8493,3.802,5.8819,4.3007,4.949,1.27,6.6689,5.7497,0.5683,3.0922,0.4455,1.4346,0.5056,0.5037,0.4449,1.8718,3.8883,5.0117,0.3522,5.3433,0.447,5.5897,4.7469,4.0324,0.9375,2.7107,0.0851,0.0567,1.5575,1.7268,2.0304,1.588,0.1048,3.8719,0.0003,3.2752,2.1744,1.3054,1.1154,2.7256,0.0232,2.5959,3.2336,2.6799,3.7765,2.2702,0.6635,0.8515,4.5991,6.6009,1.853,0.5433,1.4604,1.9918,2.4165,5.4335,2.134,4.7841,0.4789,3.6105,2.9161,2.4119,0.7652,0.8483,2.9519,1.7818,0.269,0.5934,1.1922,3.2703,3.0308,1.8177,4.5084,0.5388,1.072]}

At the same time, the international community and the West say it is unlikely that Russia will deliver any more Russian liquefied natural gas that the EU would agree to.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen O'Brien; Editing by Mark Heinrich)","token_len":347,"entropy":[6.7351,0.1999,0.0362,0.1156,7.1674,3.8501,0.989,0.6577,6.2412,3.0748,5.6948,1.0589,0.527,1.189,2.9676,0.0531,1.5797,10.5597,2.1918,1.132,3.6926,0.0005,0.0246,0.5707,5.0489,7.4368,1.5209,10.1336,1.5007,0.0105,0.1284,2.6396,0.6449,1.7774,0.104,2.0508,15.8877,9.1955,9.1745,3.8735,1.8476,1.9172,5.9008,0.0087,0.0,0.6082,0.5844,2.2816,1.9962,2.1013,1.227,0.0864,0.6473,0.543,0.0003,4.5076,5.5344,0.0124,2.5989,0.2462,0.0001,1.7315,0.5749,3.4672,4.2123,0.208,5.2136,0.5117,1.6658,2.777,1.7106,4.7432,3.1054,7.4016,4.0743,1.2546,2.0282,0.5917,0.0002,4.4949,0.6096,3.2769,1.1887,1.9775,1.1989,5.1262,2.0919,3.3434,4.3119,1.8644,4.3457,0.0341,2.3712,0.0037,0.4928,0.4696,3.0855,2.4917,1.321,0.3547,4.1346,0.0009,1.2169,1.4346,1.3036,0.0626,6.22,0.7675,5.249,2.4135,4.3991,3.0515,0.7408,0.5996,1.4638,2.778,1.989,1.2162,0.0005,0.2434,0.3054,0.2355,0.0002,2.3584,1.6358,3.8864,2.8905,4.0383,2.5796,0.8212,5.2451,0.0014,1.2776,0.0169,0.1216,1.5245,3.6195,0.3315,2.647,0.6681,0.0142,1.7997,0.0041,4.2668,0.4621,1.9424,0.3375,3.6126,1.8432,4.5633,2.4834,3.886,1.4208,0.9137,3.363,1.6491,3.1336,2.8124,2.2685,1.2894,2.0619,6.7015,3.5946,3.2413,0.293,0.1315,0.0002,4.1315,4.6265,0.0047,0.1402,0.0045,0.0003,0.0003,3.6569,1.6255,4.1839,1.8525,4.7032,2.3029,4.6862,0.1295,2.4075,4.3011,0.0166,1.9629,2.0796,0.0042,3.3769,1.5974,3.9584,0.9216,1.4632,0.3914,0.0003,4.837,0.0019,3.9845,2.6801,0.1522,1.5992,2.659,0.7702,3.0232,0.8553,0.0914,2.5058,1.2723,1.5242,0.2638,2.428,2.3154,4.3891,2.1315,3.8368,5.0887,2.9685,3.5345,7.0139,2.0962,2.1952,3.7652,5.166,0.8635,2.9568,0.0054,2.3219,7.369,1.0837,5.098,0.1952,0.0033,3.2113,0.37,7.0417,4.6221,1.0833,3.4073,2.5438,4.3617,0.2812,3.9023,2.0466,4.2492,2.4541,4.46,3.1086,3.5121,2.7293,3.5571,3.5854,2.3913,2.3696,0.3693,0.0052,2.8174,1.472,0.128,0.3652,0.0003,4.056,6.0383,0.5073,4.7684,1.4654,1.7562,4.3824,0.0475,5.0143,5.7509,1.0748,5.3025,2.9617,3.7524,4.4645,2.3084,0.2275,0.0668,1.1719,0.679,2.2038,1.7759,2.047,4.5658,4.5926,1.2068,5.548,0.3421,0.3131,5.898,1.3973,0.5499,2.667,1.7107,3.8503,0.4168,7.4738,0.4498,0.223,0.0073,0.1589,2.2396,6.9093,0.2528,3.7919,1.4488,3.3464,2.262,3.0517,0.7099,4.667,0.7064,1.1725,0.5539,5.2197,2.1725,2.8119,2.0869,5.6303,0.0052,0.0053,0.0542,0.0007,5.5738,3.4543,0.7564,2.4935,4.8636,0.0985,1.1733,0.2745,0.0002,4.5984,0.7826,0.0576,5.4538,3.663,0.0234,0.8164,0.7673,0.2299,0.001,3.645,0.2396,0.0103,0.5417]}
{"id":976,"ended":false,"length":318,"gen_text":"A federal grand jury on Friday approved the first charges in the investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters. The indictment seeks to recover thousands of dollars in campaign expenses related to the hacking and other activities, including more than $250 million related to a U.S. charity.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Russian government officials ordered the hack using an array of digital tools that were not disclosed to the public after the 2016 presidential election to bolster their own efforts, and that federal authorities have repeatedly attempted to influence the course of events, such as the 2016 election, the source said.\n\nTrump has repeatedly blamed Russia for hacking the campaign and he said recently on TV he was \"very sad\" about Russian interference. A Trump campaign spokesperson issued a denial on Friday.\n\nThe New York Times said it was a report that Mr. Putin was preparing to use Twitter to coordinate its influence campaign against Democrats in Europe, and the Times quoted Mr. Flynn on Friday as saying that Russia was not involved in the hacking but denied any connection.\n\nMr. Trump also recently threatened to cancel the NATO alliance.\n\nMr. Flynn was speaking at the State Department on April 3, when the president fired his national security adviser.

{"id":1798,"ended":true,"length":340,"gen_text":"The U.S. Senate may vote as soon as Tuesday on a bipartisan proposal that would make it easier to penalize operators of websites that facilitate online sex trafficking, according to four sources familiar with the deliberations. The proposal would allow states to ban websites that accept child pornography and turn away women accused of providing them for adoption. It should also be rejected by the Senate Intelligence Committee. The proposal would also give states the power to criminalize web sex trafficking and help enforce laws that allow victims and businesses to make sure child protection officers remain vigilant and that parents have confidence that their children will not be placed in harm's way or that Internet traffic taken by an organization will always be protected.\" The Senate estimates that the proposal could have a very broad effect for any state or local government, with a range of effects from increased surveillance measures to more money spent on mental health care, more legal protections for victims, and even legal mechanisms for courts to use against websites that facilitate sexual exploitation. There's some irony considering the fact that the \"anti-trafficking\" legislation was sponsored and signed by five members of the Republican leadership during the Obama administration. That's good news, because while in any law enforcement context, having such powerful powers should not necessarily end online sexual exploitation crimes. But it's a reminder that there might be a good countervailing effect to such legislation. When it comes to the Internet (and the rest of society), we can begin by looking at where our resources are going without any real political clout. That's because we don't take any of it for granted. When we see that the internet is full of people who want to exploit us, it's difficult not to wonder if our resources are under the very real threat of extinction.","token_len":349,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,4.6566,4.94,3.8928,4.7669,1.7019,0.0024,2.6027,0.6322,1.0891,3.7659,4.0149,1.9252,0.1662,3.4915,1.0504,0.547,1.7895,8.7613,0.0039,8.9765,1.0057,6.6019,0.7654,5.178,3.4858,3.6213,0.5881,1.5331,1.8155,0.001,6.2181,3.0204,0.4865,0.001,0.0569,2.949,0.088,2.3388,1.8341,0.9608,2.7264,1.696,0.1311,3.583,1.3224,0.4567,5.7426,4.0118,0.4807,1.7621,5.4652,3.3193,4.1959,4.4488,0.0118,4.5357,2.4053,3.0649,3.1268,0.6229,2.6491,6.585,1.0583,2.0935,5.5797,0.4311,0.7479,1.2711,4.5964,0.0194,1.664,2.2812,1.6779,1.2062,1.0255,3.6989,1.5133,0.9771,0.9828,0.0378,4.7089,0.0026,5.7418,5.4102,0.6831,2.6059,5.6781,4.1973,1.7059,1.5146,3.6462,4.1684,3.6713,5.8081,0.0768,4.0554,3.2909,5.3083,5.148,4.6138,5.1252,1.3049,2.7688,3.4079,4.7,3.1537,5.1862,1.164,0.4338,0.1983,1.1664,1.7782,0.2055,5.3456,0.2261,0.9528,0.0029,0.0001,4.7821,2.6995,6.0196,4.2658,6.2669,1.5199,3.6016,3.9558,2.9078,5.7856,0.2036,3.7516,4.6485,3.2805,2.7822,6.4535,0.6962,1.9108,1.7752,2.9333,3.1498,0.8954,4.9664,2.8406,2.7562,5.0441,5.4174,1.1232,2.263,0.6498,1.4723,1.5117,2.8013,2.5198,3.1359,0.0351,2.8721,3.1933,5.2488,5.3877,5.8602,0.6617,3.4204,4.1786,1.979,0.5509,5.2919,0.0538,1.9977,1.7725,4.0413,4.8173,2.4429,0.3907,1.5727,1.1725,0.4292,2.3476,4.4776,5.4588,1.0406,5.3577,0.0954,4.217,2.3937,2.3116,0.5251,1.7931,2.4082,0.6402,0.4409,4.9539,2.7089,3.9175,4.7594,8.1422,1.6102,1.7924,0.0154,1.2232,5.0214,5.4027,0.038,1.8785,0.0002,0.0071,0.3099,2.2192,1.8826,4.1269,3.4139,0.8068,0.1899,5.1032,2.9449,0.1242,0.9593,3.4416,3.0804,4.1939,0.2658,1.6788,0.2097,0.621,4.1151,1.3599,4.9961,0.7658,2.7826,1.4548,4.4444,5.6682,5.4251,5.6613,1.601,2.7106,0.9646,5.4863,4.5351,4.5957,2.443,4.3211,1.811,4.1657,5.4723,4.9029,2.6392,0.3804,5.9319,0.4568,2.4829,1.6266,1.3739,2.4629,3.3835,0.332,3.1268,5.3704,0.2712,2.0981,4.4865,6.0931,2.3522,0.0047,2.7984,1.3785,3.0586,1.4612,1.1056,5.2635,1.9757,0.0877,0.039,2.5394,2.1335,6.4091,0.6128,2.2994,3.8043,0.0059,2.0689,0.5492,2.802,2.9057,5.1046,1.633,3.0136,0.3388,4.5437,3.0825,4.3334,0.6781,2.0594,6.0623,2.9386,3.461,4.1891,4.5619,0.5233,4.2154,0.6534,1.2554,2.7343,2.1632,0.0004,5.6365,2.7286,2.0969,2.3688,1.2356,0.0067,0.7364,3.9371,1.5324,3.7178,2.6218,2.0772,4.5499,0.664,5.0252,0.0159,2.1769,0.6822,2.7858,0.2633,3.7151,1.38,0.6754,2.1943,0.7042,4.0285,2.1734,0.0043,2.6822,1.781,2.7968,3.7504,0.698,4.7725,3.5691,5.7804,3.2143,0.1207,0.2414,5.2223,0.2432]}

If it is made, the United States should provide the green light to begin testing ballistic missiles in Cuba. There are a variety of reasons for why the Obama administration could decide to send missiles, with one such factor being what Trump's proposed strike on Syria would mean.\n\nMany more countries can opt to do away with military cooperation with Russia with little or no political benefit. There are also the implications for the international community, especially China, that are unlikely to go away.\n\nWhat should be clear from this video is that the Cuban Missile Crisis is part of a larger national security policy. The missiles and interceptors will become part of the international deal, not just as long term deterrent for U.S. allies but for others already in the region to consider.\n\nThe Cuban missile crisis will set a great change in American foreign policy. It is already beginning to look like an international war game, and the United States is already seeing a clear advantage for Cuban officials in this endeavor.

They have fought two series of offensive battles recently in the South China Sea, and are expected to mount further attacks in the coming days.\n\n(Editing by Jonathan Allen and Robert Birsel)","token_len":354,"entropy":[4.8843,6.843,2.1218,4.3827,3.9714,0.1189,3.3773,2.2902,5.5258,2.5604,6.088,3.0295,2.2799,1.0146,0.063,5.3029,0.0037,1.3291,4.8878,1.7749,0.6745,3.5201,0.8425,0.0905,1.2232,1.7556,7.1536,0.2118,0.3036,0.0026,5.5093,6.1335,0.5496,0.7561,1.2162,0.0296,0.0001,0.0001,0.0014,0.067,0.0312,3.2567,0.5311,0.0989,4.6333,0.1174,0.1948,0.0002,5.569,3.0641,1.1299,3.8396,3.2093,0.0443,0.7465,2.1237,2.6342,0.1679,0.121,0.4089,2.0479,1.5532,0.0441,0.1477,6.2973,0.2224,0.5861,1.9499,0.673,0.0002,3.0964,0.1774,2.4324,2.0368,0.4191,0.4335,0.0017,0.0284,0.0029,0.0006,0.0,0.0001,2.9706,1.4082,1.7418,6.4673,3.4623,0.2852,2.499,1.0225,1.3441,1.8325,0.0014,3.7972,3.535,1.9682,1.8072,0.1887,0.2424,0.4006,5.1012,0.0589,4.5464,6.0022,3.5267,1.0725,5.0668,2.6272,5.9535,0.5129,1.708,2.3279,1.8366,0.0421,5.3694,1.2685,1.2972,0.1794,0.0002,1.4875,1.7039,1.6623,5.2864,0.2599,1.1376,5.1245,0.5915,4.8072,0.4906,0.1592,2.3781,3.2935,1.214,1.345,1.2299,0.6814,0.3655,0.5642,1.3119,1.4371,2.2685,3.0964,3.1992,1.3251,3.7781,5.3035,2.0977,0.9901,7.8623,4.3125,4.5202,4.2633,4.115,2.4663,1.4456,4.8902,0.1386,2.3069,3.2873,3.2943,3.5459,0.1144,0.003,4.973,1.6595,1.9376,5.6875,2.2325,5.6499,2.927,5.2683,2.6948,1.3516,0.4077,0.1653,0.0002,2.0313,3.512,0.0006,0.0903,0.5934,1.9853,0.0045,1.1155,2.1795,0.9503,0.9884,3.3584,0.7288,0.3947,2.0596,1.4053,0.0688,4.2828,4.9289,1.0951,0.8363,1.0557,2.1245,3.8538,0.2105,0.1725,0.3,1.494,1.6394,4.5681,1.0488,2.604,2.1443,0.2221,5.4693,3.0552,0.5212,0.9621,0.6949,3.7289,4.5773,3.1935,0.1458,7.0118,0.7024,5.4128,0.9406,0.0021,3.6967,0.1114,7.5949,1.2853,2.4521,1.9115,5.6177,0.0163,5.3356,3.4032,1.5245,2.0611,1.6438,0.1427,0.0002,5.85,2.4733,2.1643,2.7241,4.9113,5.048,2.5626,0.6024,4.9032,0.2211,3.5084,1.5906,6.1177,0.7667,2.2498,4.6574,1.5081,4.8147,2.2102,0.445,0.3131,0.7522,1.8371,4.3861,1.9979,2.4631,0.2138,5.3362,1.2708,4.9222,0.388,3.8772,0.3735,1.4871,7.8795,2.0863,3.5652,3.8756,3.305,1.1896,0.4567,0.3728,0.0003,1.8194,3.2473,1.2491,0.4344,1.6329,5.004,4.0839,1.3253,0.9674,2.1647,2.4779,0.9184,4.0847,1.6261,2.8671,5.762,4.9554,2.881,4.236,0.8233,1.4919,2.287,0.4123,0.1248,0.1836,0.6054,4.2847,2.3517,1.5383,2.6359,2.212,4.246,0.7324,4.4162,4.2587,5.9022,0.0032,4.2052,1.093,6.7275,1.3559,1.1535,4.4627,2.1349,0.0023,0.9795,1.8857,1.9946,3.0535,0.0049,4.8258,2.0827,1.4601,1.131,0.3862,0.8133,0.6308,0.6258,0.42,0.0003,4.2087,3.1478,0.0042,0.0018,3.7025,5.9878,1.3798,4.4913,0.0115,0.0152,0.2047]}

The two main sources of information that the authorities are looking into include details that officials hope will help them to determine who is behind the Paradise Papers, as well as how large the amounts could have travelled and where the money was transferred.","token_len":356,"entropy":[4.7838,2.3974,8.2464,0.6077,3.1614,1.292,5.0208,1.3699,0.6138,2.9573,5.9069,3.7628,10.2329,0.9788,0.8408,6.5923,0.0188,0.0007,8.3333,0.0155,0.8742,0.98,1.0679,0.0069,3.5076,0.6528,2.5914,1.6044,5.9052,4.1439,3.6064,1.6106,0.8989,4.748,0.5967,7.1085,1.3434,1.0575,1.9995,3.6302,1.9407,3.0818,1.9795,1.0551,4.6369,3.4852,1.6818,2.3396,3.1516,2.4953,3.1705,0.0007,4.822,2.7135,1.7905,2.9879,1.4485,3.3715,1.1056,4.1414,4.5968,1.3233,0.6925,4.8302,3.0722,1.597,1.0911,1.8298,3.015,0.2657,1.4118,3.5494,0.001,1.7323,0.7693,5.3867,5.1485,3.603,4.7665,1.6743,5.9487,0.2627,4.9572,0.0043,1.3095,1.5818,5.8688,5.5317,6.6676,5.0633,7.0875,0.1165,3.7205,1.4618,1.9879,3.1504,0.4285,1.7333,4.9808,0.0115,0.0091,1.0222,1.0994,1.8645,0.9758,2.8413,4.2476,3.2058,2.0589,2.44,1.6435,5.8284,0.26,1.4193,3.9847,2.3064,0.0017,0.0008,0.0004,0.0001,0.0,4.1795,2.2709,3.9421,0.2601,4.0831,0.5945,2.299,3.0656,0.9904,1.7894,3.4715,4.2959,4.6099,4.6749,0.0036,3.1681,2.0431,5.0476,3.1633,2.8575,2.6669,0.9905,0.0293,4.5803,1.2663,2.0689,2.0074,5.3286,0.2203,3.674,2.9247,2.7877,3.1619,0.0015,2.8995,2.4536,3.7547,4.7818,5.2305,0.6555,2.8625,4.5284,3.9837,1.7051,5.6451,5.6401,4.5265,3.941,2.8497,4.9254,1.1316,4.504,2.1035,0.4324,2.322,5.5416,1.5608,1.5759,1.435,3.9652,1.6157,1.6048,1.5044,0.3396,0.9219,4.1217,1.7178,2.6081,3.8621,3.4418,2.5522,2.0469,3.1616,0.6813,1.936,1.2475,0.0058,0.5616,1.5883,0.5821,1.5618,3.9076,2.1071,1.7513,0.0059,0.0055,4.5352,1.3429,4.5894,5.4296,1.0662,5.9737,2.3022,2.2398,2.1035,1.4692,1.5773,2.0012,0.7164,2.1646,0.3796,1.3232,3.6921,1.6706,3.7089,0.9548,0.7209,6.5772,1.3387,0.0149,2.4665,1.5801,1.5252,2.1446,3.7034,0.0026,3.5099,1.0016,2.653,0.2963,2.6613,2.4161,3.9986,0.2844,1.0498,1.4219,4.593,2.3971,2.9372,4.756,0.8081,1.1218,3.7321,4.9352,2.5706,1.4524,2.4585,0.7372,0.7853,1.5646,2.801,4.0482,3.1976,1.6061,1.6159,5.1929,0.9832,6.3058,0.5503,4.6829,3.6599,2.6039,4.619,3.5418,0.5426,2.7066,0.13,3.9479,0.7806,6.0729,0.919,2.8551,2.1463,3.0326,0.9592,1.8208,0.2864,5.8026,0.9946,4.05,1.8502,3.7481,1.8488,3.2628,2.0999,4.5109,5.3477,2.9633,0.9107,2.9562,2.9059,2.2927,2.0674,3.8331,0.7394,5.2744,3.3445,0.8541,2.0448,5.9498,3.693,3.7222,0.2327,1.5758,2.8184,1.9825,3.8121,1.0351,0.4093,0.5766,1.9164,4.8472,4.8656,5.9583,4.5612,0.2355,1.0503,0.6637,2.4409,3.0982,1.203,1.4425,1.0538,0.3054,3.45,0.0039,1.4373,2.4967,0.0256,0.007,2.8076,5.0736,0.752,4.1909,3.4822,2.3104,6.8999,2.7216,1.8749,1.6692,0.9877,1.011,3.0477,0.4862]}

A lawsuit was filed against her and Japan, calling her a \"slag\".\n\nIn 2005, Japanese court found that the Japanese government did not have the power to compel employees to work under radiation therapy, and so had to impose a standard standard \"in such circumstances where it was not practicable and unreasonable for the employee to succeed\" in the employer's case.\n\nJapanese courts have never overturned a case, and Yoshiyama said she now hoped it would come back at least again.

The party is facing an immediate challenge from Pinalini.\n\nThe latest poll, published on Sunday followed weeks of calls by many Italians for a party more involved with campaigning in the upcoming presidential elections in June.\n\nThe former head of the European Parliament, the conservative National Front, led by Matteo Renzi, has been an outspoken critic of the European Commission's proposals to slash its EU subsidies.\n\nRenzi recently threatened to cancel the EU referendum.\n\nBut on Sunday there was not as much optimism about the Front's chances of getting a majority in Parliament, having earlier recorded its lowest turnout since the beginning of last year.\n\nThe latest poll was commissioned by the right-wing Italian think-tank the Pascual Research Group.\n\nIt shows that 41 per cent of those polled would vote for Renzi over Pinalini.\n\nIn the latest poll, the party's leader, Matteo Renzi, led by a record 24 per cent of voters polled, while 36 per cent said they would support him by a margin of one to one.","token_len":358,"entropy":[8.9778,8.9347,15.3581,4.3772,7.032,7.6626,1.7655,4.0388,1.6183,1.876,4.264,2.6869,2.2436,1.3791,3.2016,0.001,1.5478,2.0837,2.3782,0.8353,1.81,2.9109,2.3531,3.4015,6.3999,2.4527,2.5575,6.734,5.1538,0.5481,2.2996,1.2264,0.2973,0.9006,0.9032,2.6713,4.0682,4.9073,1.8102,0.6416,5.1535,1.1469,0.2763,3.4909,4.2618,2.6439,1.4562,2.8711,1.6997,1.8374,3.5622,0.0031,0.8614,4.0877,0.1397,0.0875,2.6465,0.7806,0.961,0.3909,1.3734,5.195,5.132,1.7688,0.5476,0.5806,0.5456,2.7008,0.5432,0.4902,0.0003,1.3595,3.9859,1.0902,5.0529,0.7721,0.3526,4.3986,1.4278,5.4182,5.4219,0.5358,1.2936,3.7511,0.0844,0.6953,0.5824,0.1843,0.0271,3.1196,0.3383,3.1365,4.4755,6.5442,2.6418,0.759,2.332,1.6702,3.0771,2.5142,1.7236,0.0007,1.6424,0.2694,0.4388,1.5157,0.7645,0.0002,1.2976,3.4592,0.101,2.5851,4.8584,0.3453,3.1707,4.6307,0.996,0.5131,0.4472,4.3368,4.0449,4.1615,1.3422,3.9082,3.3925,5.5318,0.0531,5.4775,0.0015,4.0606,2.6224,0.153,3.4686,2.9904,0.0082,4.4006,1.7527,1.1013,2.024,1.6725,2.0891,5.0245,2.4989,5.3079,1.4737,0.2836,6.2139,5.4016,4.5819,3.967,0.4215,0.0002,1.3625,3.3558,0.6575,1.8459,2.3243,0.5041,0.7895,7.3439,6.7655,0.0557,4.0019,1.5688,4.46,4.048,0.4615,1.7126,4.6707,4.9875,4.6217,2.009,6.3672,1.876,0.8865,4.1516,3.3852,0.9171,2.0675,3.1412,0.4296,0.5154,0.0002,1.4775,5.6869,3.8095,0.0027,0.6187,3.8194,1.1371,1.1526,3.8522,3.146,4.4755,0.5279,1.0358,4.8256,0.2647,2.6581,0.0002,0.1063,0.0004,0.1304,1.4539,1.655,5.1938,0.5714,0.1581,0.0106,1.0732,2.5171,1.5056,1.0519,4.166,0.5688,5.4963,4.0032,2.7615,4.7368,1.6054,0.5501,0.0002,3.7237,0.0019,4.9648,4.1612,0.1947,4.3763,1.3758,1.691,3.8019,4.0942,0.786,0.0002,3.9343,3.9244,0.3812,5.0696,0.5617,4.9781,4.4682,0.3035,3.4514,1.4661,0.6633,2.8839,0.8739,0.5603,1.3514,2.9844,1.3692,0.2714,0.8752,3.1224,1.7161,5.5812,5.6729,5.238,3.3744,2.1424,3.0335,1.0306,1.561,4.2293,0.0023,2.4102,0.1439,0.2869,0.3858,0.0002,1.325,1.9237,0.5661,2.602,3.5248,0.219,0.9787,5.5577,0.0869,0.077,2.8126,3.8317,1.2836,0.0094,3.567,5.5267,4.8216,0.8143,2.6757,2.0486,1.6394,1.1077,0.0002,1.4912,2.4897,0.9405,5.0592,0.1678,0.0003,0.1616,2.6975,0.8061,3.4602,1.3475,0.289,1.5654,0.005,3.2115,1.593,0.4945,0.0041,1.9512,0.8201,0.0002,3.7159,1.3101,1.9491,0.6598,0.4266,2.0457,3.2795,1.5389,3.0069,0.6041,1.3448,0.0003,0.3705,0.0137,0.0586,3.9444,0.4025,2.1098,4.017,4.0331,0.4274,0.0005,1.0761,2.2015,3.3465,0.6278,2.2593,5.7256,0.033,0.0009,3.0855,0.467,0.4624,2.1282,2.2074,5.1308,1.1272,0.9256,0.0227,3.6001,1.0588,0.469,0.1266]}
{"id":1420,"ended":false,"length":348,"gen_text":"Republican Senator Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Wednesday that Facebook ads bought by Russia-linked entities targeted more than just Michigan and Wisconsin, the two states listed in the latest list that are the largest targets of Russian efforts. The companies targeted Michigan were founded in 2001 and have been operating since 1999, although those firms have not yet been listed anywhere in the latest report. The top three ads identified include two from the Russian government, one from the group FSB and the other from Facebook. The fifth and final advertiser\u2014based in Austria at the company's headquarters\u2014is the group that created the fake version of The Times with the fake name of one of its Facebook ads. While Russia never ordered ads for any of the United States' top Republican candidates, it did attempt to target one of their primary opponents. As a result, the ads target four prominent Republican presidential candidates in Michigan, where the two former secretaries of state and attorney general are from, and two state Senate races. In all, Facebook and Facebook employees have not independently confirmed or denied who paid for the ads during the election period. A spokeswoman for Mark Zuckerberg, who is also the head of Facebook, said that Facebook spent some $300,000 last year to produce Facebook ads from Facebook-owned subsidiaries in Arizona, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. When asked by The Washington Post if the fake ads were targeted in Michigan, he said, \"That's just an open question.\" Facebook said that no political ads were shown on the state's Facebook pages in any of the battlegrounds that the company conducts in the past three weeks. It said it would like to clarify what it means by that because it has \"not yet reached a conclusion, and we look forward to answering any questions you have.\"","token_len":359,"entropy":[8.6604,4.4514,1.7696,1.5188,2.4465,1.7409,0.0134,0.018,0.4797,0.4453,0.0107,0.2235,1.4003,2.4155,2.1662,0.4406,8.4953,6.5732,5.8984,0.5172,3.3584,3.364,0.2601,2.7184,5.5061,5.0644,0.2116,6.2484,9.6922,1.801,2.1611,1.8819,4.0819,1.2591,1.599,8.1943,1.1596,0.5796,4.9869,4.1505,4.3386,2.5425,3.0665,5.8297,3.1144,0.4257,1.6898,2.8,0.8561,3.477,3.4181,3.3963,3.8037,2.9307,5.023,1.0081,4.7605,1.1128,2.2388,1.9596,2.3334,0.8129,4.4596,1.6977,5.5237,4.5861,4.2959,1.1739,0.9526,2.4122,0.8796,4.8179,8.2318,1.0958,0.1562,5.7906,1.7886,0.2974,2.6688,5.05,1.9492,4.2588,5.2334,5.3098,3.9598,1.6329,2.0158,3.2356,2.6068,1.4793,1.0064,0.4737,1.466,6.054,4.0481,0.3342,1.4453,1.2793,0.3076,0.1101,2.7881,0.4721,1.8929,5.535,2.4405,1.3895,4.6675,0.0035,5.5274,4.9961,0.2957,5.1105,5.2641,0.5842,4.6715,0.3064,1.2886,0.9648,1.9852,2.7703,3.7752,3.3373,4.1559,0.6492,3.1397,6.282,0.0319,4.5819,3.6578,4.6986,1.0065,4.7389,1.6827,1.1359,4.8852,0.1642,1.3333,4.9222,1.9197,0.5362,5.5957,4.9042,5.7616,4.882,3.1274,3.8414,3.5888,0.241,0.5757,5.8654,0.0214,0.1583,2.7628,5.4111,1.8841,0.3341,1.263,2.0512,3.5972,0.1212,2.4476,4.1806,0.463,2.1653,4.6297,1.6979,2.4812,4.8073,2.1025,0.1467,0.3959,1.2309,1.4423,5.1568,5.1595,3.9906,1.4135,3.0227,0.4276,2.2836,1.8377,0.8935,5.066,1.9643,3.1833,5.3706,2.0118,0.0251,0.1836,2.7677,4.4273,0.0358,1.2956,2.4678,1.7724,1.7485,2.2659,4.4173,2.2449,1.5214,0.9409,2.9488,2.884,0.2796,1.6837,3.7619,1.8459,5.2229,1.7726,3.9148,6.4047,0.8016,1.0419,0.0249,4.9469,2.1791,0.1999,0.5907,0.459,6.8966,0.4048,2.5577,3.6552,0.3862,3.7276,2.1039,0.0652,5.322,0.3979,1.0164,2.1674,1.6982,1.5713,1.6463,3.9059,0.0013,0.0999,0.4296,1.5559,2.0473,2.2773,5.9078,4.982,0.1662,4.3362,0.1871,0.0009,3.7408,0.2792,1.5537,4.9432,5.5503,0.2085,4.4941,4.5768,2.7624,0.669,3.6705,1.5048,4.2597,0.557,4.635,0.1036,0.5522,3.5687,0.0724,0.6914,2.2013,0.5344,5.3212,0.6783,2.5591,1.7308,2.0117,0.0518,1.8357,1.3461,5.4656,0.4332,0.8739,3.1574,0.9508,1.3266,0.2492,2.0968,0.6323,0.8261,0.0206,3.7922,0.4854,3.8686,3.4629,3.4924,0.0521,0.5304,2.5574,2.485,1.6246,5.0731,4.5402,1.1204,0.5874,3.9335,2.9019,0.8805,3.8884,0.5017,3.2603,2.031,2.2839,2.7901,0.4146,0.3808,4.7167,2.999,2.939,2.2071,2.32,5.6135,2.0089,0.8641,5.5625,2.5545,1.9438,0.3355,3.4023,1.2304,1.3831,3.169,5.4989,0.1409,3.955,2.4033,2.1103,1.7858,0.4727,3.5505,3.1078,0.7908,2.4198,3.1818,3.3342,1.4504,4.675,2.0492,1.2834,4.9808,1.5465,1.0602,4.4754,0.0687,0.0052,3.2839,1.7189,0.2073,2.97,2.1421,0.4483]}

On Nov. 20, for example, in a speech he made as secretary of state, he vowed that he would make it easier for Israelis and Palestinians to secure and pay the fees required for Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights where Palestinians are trapped under siege by Israeli military occupation and the terrorist group Hamas.

As part of his push to build a wall north of Jerusalem, Mr. Trump has said the wall won't go along with what is called a wall of separation from occupied West Bank land.\n\n\"I call on all sides to work together quickly towards achieving peace,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If the United States decides Israel is in war, I call on all sides to stop the process of building these walls.\"\n\nPresident Trump, who was the first U.S. president to visit the Jerusalem settlement of Hillel in 2005, is due to hold two talks with American presidents after the G-8 summit, this week in Rome, and next Tuesday in Washington.\n\nWrite to Philip Klein at philip.klein@wsj.com","token_len":359,"entropy":[2.6156,5.2338,0.0074,2.4775,5.1234,0.3284,4.0168,0.3521,8.7389,0.1709,5.0515,0.6706,1.1601,6.6094,0.6084,2.508,12.2973,5.0122,2.4662,7.8849,4.034,1.1605,1.8238,10.6521,6.5714,8.118,0.5304,2.594,2.821,4.868,0.0025,0.0125,0.1821,1.8573,2.3861,5.1006,8.9483,2.4891,1.81,4.6739,0.828,0.7944,0.0004,3.2413,1.7997,4.9189,1.7322,0.1605,3.1965,0.0199,0.2501,1.1235,4.1842,0.3378,3.9692,4.268,4.5441,5.0587,4.2001,1.2349,4.8861,5.7546,0.3045,3.1132,1.2,4.296,6.075,0.0017,3.2893,0.0908,3.951,0.7352,0.0041,4.3697,1.2301,1.3587,3.5577,2.1026,4.0357,1.301,0.0138,0.0412,0.2733,0.6396,3.8714,1.994,2.1385,0.3159,4.4449,2.7339,2.3345,0.2251,2.7468,2.0504,0.2065,0.1731,4.5322,4.6819,5.539,3.665,5.5231,2.9247,1.0353,3.5484,0.9588,4.4421,0.2619,0.3598,2.9679,0.0706,0.0193,7.5084,2.917,2.1799,2.7633,2.18,1.91,0.9423,0.7135,3.1306,2.3831,2.4526,3.0712,5.295,1.1353,0.1271,0.1177,6.1293,5.6978,1.0592,2.6582,0.3486,0.9483,0.1705,1.1158,0.0003,0.1433,2.2012,1.2687,0.9602,5.4985,3.2719,1.556,2.6699,0.0014,3.5532,3.1704,2.7907,4.2928,1.9429,3.8003,4.2347,3.5433,0.83,0.2181,1.3247,0.4,0.0002,2.08,0.0005,2.0948,1.3109,4.0766,5.134,3.2302,2.0966,6.0938,0.3772,0.0271,3.7569,0.9219,0.3928,4.6203,3.9008,0.3782,0.8008,5.7353,0.016,5.8009,3.6704,0.557,5.6996,0.1393,2.6715,0.6293,1.2672,0.0608,4.8446,3.3015,0.0052,1.294,4.4042,3.2996,3.8842,5.5067,3.3757,2.0836,8.3821,1.1434,5.5965,4.0465,2.0615,4.929,2.4414,4.6148,3.7776,0.0013,1.2831,4.0674,0.4039,3.036,0.7108,0.8748,8.2959,0.0752,1.291,0.3406,0.3578,0.0005,0.1759,2.449,2.5376,2.8991,2.5892,5.2691,0.0014,3.3098,3.3152,0.7536,4.2817,2.7639,3.185,1.9333,3.9426,1.3552,0.2362,3.2733,6.4966,4.0779,0.0937,0.8687,0.5037,0.557,0.0002,2.7548,1.8257,5.8456,0.4313,1.4122,1.8586,0.5194,2.3089,0.3982,7.0276,6.7537,3.588,2.1195,1.5522,0.2798,0.0004,0.8583,0.2813,1.1068,0.6029,3.5973,2.5975,2.6172,0.0136,4.8187,5.2925,1.4075,3.3834,5.4502,0.9968,2.0019,2.1979,0.0857,0.9209,0.3254,0.2238,3.0252,2.3881,4.7917,1.2883,1.8289,4.1203,0.465,1.0461,0.3028,0.0002,5.5091,0.589,3.1134,1.5072,3.3329,4.9026,1.4265,1.316,0.0003,0.0053,0.003,0.1083,0.0874,0.5578,2.3411,4.6813,4.2535,1.1469,5.6405,3.0689,0.0001,2.5797,3.2035,0.1727,2.8442,4.6105,0.185,3.1515,5.2148,3.516,0.4376,6.2942,3.97,4.8306,1.6341,2.1464,0.815,0.5701,0.4159,2.8358,5.7669,0.7404,1.5524,3.7001,1.585,2.3324,2.3435,3.7632,0.3303,2.3277,0.5268,0.9521,0.0003,3.5563,0.0011,5.4806,3.4188,0.0411,0.7077,0.0373,0.0001,0.0836,0.0,0.0006,0.0009,0.0,0.0028,0.0005]}

{"id":4802,"ended":false,"length":323,"gen_text":"A German court ruled on Wednesday that a 96-year-old German known as the bookkeeper of Auschwitz was fit to go to prison, rejecting his plea for the sentence to be suspended. Oskar Groening, the judge in that case, said that he would grant the request of the lawyer for his client. In November, he sentenced the bookkeeper to 20 years for the crimes in question. Groening could be deported into another state with another case pending against him. Another of his lawyers, Andreas Wohlfeld, said he wants Groening convicted on what he called a \"systemic violation of freedom of religion.\"\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\n\"Groening knew what he was doing but he doesn't deserve to have a future on a platform that has no real merit, with no prospects of change,\" Wohlfeld said. \"The law already says a person can be forced to confess the truth in order to live out their life's mission.\" In recent years, activists have accused many of the convicted bookkeepers of abusing their power, and there has been a flurry of charges against suspects based on confessions leaked during the Nazi period. Oskar Groening, who is serving a life sentence on a 1985 burglary charge for committing a second, was one of the bookkeepers of Auschwitz when it was bombed in 1944. On Sept. 15, one of the bookkeeper's lawyers presented the case in Germany with the view that he will be deported into another state with another case pending against him. As for the appeal, those who oppose the move say it will be inadmissible, even if the judge doesn't like it. The case against Oskar Groening will likely be dismissed based on his plea for rehabilitation.\n\nRead more about:","token_len":359,"entropy":[9.3494,4.2764,2.4536,1.4366,2.0112,0.1129,2.3213,9.399,0.0282,0.0591,0.025,0.0005,2.7185,8.0056,0.6828,2.771,9.2307,1.6563,1.6316,3.6839,2.0885,7.2277,0.1729,5.7752,0.5786,1.1432,2.4604,7.3685,2.7084,3.5845,1.7473,3.7909,4.0938,3.1963,0.4815,3.347,0.9336,9.0076,1.595,0.018,5.9685,3.6118,0.6994,1.5407,2.5025,2.0018,5.1704,0.1904,0.1457,1.1654,1.4342,2.0741,2.3737,4.6836,1.1831,1.6983,2.4433,1.0716,5.3839,0.9364,2.9951,0.2041,1.3337,4.4191,4.9221,0.8453,2.5865,2.7649,2.3652,1.7281,0.0438,0.3965,3.9759,0.0633,3.4082,2.2487,2.2249,3.8784,2.3698,0.7141,2.6419,0.0011,4.8334,1.9057,3.5786,5.8304,3.1205,2.1805,5.1569,5.1936,3.0593,1.4002,3.4284,0.0572,0.3508,6.2372,3.9167,2.0815,2.1278,0.4432,4.3127,4.1872,5.3917,0.6324,1.2211,0.2824,0.3016,1.3201,1.6189,6.0604,3.4177,0.0006,5.3024,2.8918,5.8396,0.4482,1.0238,1.3409,0.4816,4.3802,2.1857,3.2329,0.6006,3.9153,0.4442,3.9207,0.8682,1.5406,0.0005,4.7183,0.0617,0.0,0.0006,0.0001,1.4391,6.2269,0.0066,5.8843,3.2648,0.6642,0.4026,0.3246,4.31,1.1532,5.6143,0.0005,3.9835,0.8908,2.7797,3.2441,4.0432,4.3836,2.619,4.2858,1.112,3.4229,1.882,3.7043,5.0512,3.2093,5.1274,0.9885,5.5503,0.8834,4.6391,0.5951,0.4801,0.0009,0.001,0.0012,0.0001,0.4006,0.7476,1.492,2.531,4.2488,5.3316,2.2346,3.9792,1.259,1.3298,1.1663,5.3558,0.2041,3.1485,5.2393,2.782,3.0549,1.6075,0.035,3.9525,3.8513,1.6721,2.2561,3.1736,2.4962,1.4132,3.2697,4.9319,0.8638,0.2199,6.2731,0.7219,3.6826,4.4207,0.9982,0.3672,3.6814,2.157,0.0685,0.1291,5.028,0.8401,1.0358,2.0748,2.6717,4.6464,1.6997,0.0899,1.0902,4.6488,0.0037,4.7002,1.219,5.9987,5.8045,0.3144,2.95,6.4346,3.8839,0.8849,3.4508,2.4289,0.2708,4.9327,0.0974,0.0038,0.0415,0.0025,1.3445,1.3044,2.2203,3.2559,0.8273,1.1983,0.0301,3.4204,2.0235,5.942,5.3342,0.873,3.2133,5.3321,1.902,3.5534,3.8852,2.5052,3.5033,0.0983,1.2548,2.1125,0.365,2.3465,0.4079,3.8992,1.9232,0.2086,3.16,1.1184,2.5272,0.4176,4.8816,3.6367,0.0042,3.462,0.0479,6.5621,0.4612,0.8265,1.4735,2.6621,0.3167,1.4966,5.281,2.3561,1.321,2.5602,3.7686,4.4583,1.7419,4.9838,0.2245,1.9556,4.5799,0.9438,2.17,2.3299,0.5675,0.1955,1.7908,0.8868,0.1236,0.2483,0.2808,0.0083,0.2295,5.3179,2.6353,1.0966,4.4436,0.628,6.5042,1.2743,4.1607,1.0749,3.8356,1.724,1.1222,1.7129,2.1533,5.1539,3.6665,0.3144,2.6055,3.6359,0.9729,1.3146,2.2339,4.4651,0.0002,3.4307,0.682,0.183,2.1968,2.3245,2.0855,1.9458,0.0015,0.001,0.0326,0.0013,3.3791,2.9258,1.1936,3.577,5.3002,0.0472,2.1046,2.0436,2.1617,5.8248,0.9966,3.2601,0.0004,0.9389,0.001,0.0001,0.0004]}

The new report will give lawmakers more time to conduct their own independent public investigation into Russia's dealings with the Trump campaign.\n\nPresident Trump, who was the subject of a Senate Select Committee on Intelligence probe last fall, had previously said he would hold an open hearing that included Russian officials, Democrats and independent lawmakers.\n\nThe report will come as news of the investigation is published.\n\nWrite to Philip Klein at philip.klein@wsj.com","token_len":361,"entropy":[9.6169,5.5775,9.144,2.0173,3.6337,3.007,0.2972,2.743,4.9105,0.0228,9.1388,4.9396,0.0531,0.0168,0.0171,4.9468,2.6223,6.4164,1.4979,2.5867,4.6485,3.4913,1.8802,9.8433,2.37,0.3248,4.5376,5.8703,3.9632,3.8278,0.2945,0.8892,3.0623,0.2116,0.2747,1.0028,2.1274,9.6403,2.8491,0.0485,1.83,1.9197,1.6251,0.229,0.0157,0.0158,0.4009,0.4915,0.0176,0.0928,0.7513,1.3862,2.3507,0.1213,0.2508,0.0003,4.6717,0.1935,0.0817,4.8826,0.0105,1.7873,2.3746,2.0956,1.5574,4.7139,1.1936,5.2963,2.5009,5.921,0.0047,3.5818,1.1327,2.7118,2.5472,5.0088,2.9548,3.0218,0.3736,0.3892,0.4686,2.9594,5.4898,2.4003,5.5608,3.8173,0.0254,5.058,0.0405,0.733,0.4381,3.4186,2.4848,2.2974,5.4181,2.4116,4.4091,2.5141,1.158,5.2257,1.1753,0.8221,0.2579,0.0004,2.0906,4.0144,4.2798,2.1051,4.3083,2.238,5.9795,3.7246,3.2291,0.0223,3.6055,0.9598,2.1582,0.7634,2.0364,2.2827,2.1607,2.6505,5.4169,2.3841,2.6635,0.5713,1.984,2.5036,3.7286,3.4311,0.2028,3.2238,0.0011,1.3284,2.985,0.9436,0.5194,3.2829,0.3348,0.6035,2.2333,2.4438,3.1524,0.388,4.2243,1.1846,4.3294,0.0002,0.0729,1.7781,4.9388,4.0492,1.0471,2.6956,2.1307,3.8233,3.8293,5.3992,1.5885,4.2407,4.6701,1.4049,6.0545,0.9385,0.5853,5.585,6.788,1.4364,0.3414,2.6394,2.2284,0.429,4.0338,1.6556,0.0388,1.0829,1.2615,5.0018,2.2346,0.6161,3.0707,0.9187,3.2948,2.5609,3.522,0.9864,0.1789,3.9545,0.7432,0.0958,0.162,0.0004,2.2317,1.8999,4.1566,1.9861,1.8662,3.5671,2.7332,0.1993,5.1858,3.3748,2.7555,1.8498,0.0422,0.6741,4.0297,2.5349,3.2116,1.1325,2.1085,0.5722,3.4664,1.9004,2.1683,0.2748,1.9336,0.2183,3.6147,4.0165,2.6556,0.2217,5.0186,6.4375,3.8321,3.2211,1.0583,2.3835,0.0007,5.3374,0.0001,0.0024,0.8668,0.9766,0.7459,0.0299,0.0092,0.026,0.3232,0.6131,0.0431,1.2451,3.3109,0.6351,0.2041,0.394,0.0002,1.4415,3.9961,4.1852,4.0119,0.0016,5.6155,0.004,4.1505,6.6584,4.2893,1.4179,2.6292,4.4033,0.7103,2.589,2.1612,1.8108,2.0382,1.2672,1.9532,4.4192,1.113,1.5196,3.3555,2.2931,1.6897,0.1281,0.0276,4.4578,0.9087,0.3278,1.7334,5.855,2.5853,1.4789,1.8661,0.2323,4.7842,0.7236,0.4318,0.693,0.0362,1.3301,0.4993,0.0002,4.9268,1.0086,2.8266,1.1698,3.0345,4.8525,0.9435,0.0021,1.395,3.3547,5.4878,0.0311,0.3046,0.0819,2.4438,1.1443,4.214,0.2502,3.7982,2.6596,1.1495,0.9111,1.1788,4.3309,2.7329,1.8721,0.2866,6.3344,4.3054,3.672,0.9423,1.6632,5.7231,0.2525,2.9966,3.4278,0.7919,0.8073,0.0002,1.6322,1.9672,1.5452,3.8593,0.944,5.1059,1.1511,0.5171,3.6439,3.1693,5.3883,1.138,1.0929,0.0003,3.7218,0.0009,5.5321,4.0176,0.0485,0.5794,0.2434,0.0003,0.079,0.0,0.0008,0.0007,0.0,0.0025,0.0004]}

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying reiterated Bo's call for \"fast, diplomatic and non-interference\" on the peninsula.She said China had no intention of invading Taiwan.The move comes a week after Taiwan was hit by a South Korea submarine strike, one of the most brutal naval operations by the two nations in decades.Two islands in the South China Sea were also rammed during the war last year and both had huge sea gates erected on them.The attack on Taiwan in response to a joint military strike against Guam, the South China Sea's largest, drew widespread concern.\"\"All China should stand united behind Taiwan as an island nation, if necessary,\" said China's Deputy Foreign Minister Gu Liquan, after visiting the island this week.","token_len":365,"entropy":[7.4407,4.6006,7.9564,0.4481,4.8183,6.6824,3.8383,0.9769,0.8625,6.6653,1.4911,2.8479,2.9507,1.2322,1.3436,1.4527,1.962,4.7418,2.2363,4.5981,3.7174,5.4577,3.6806,6.6506,0.0113,4.4547,0.0246,0.6389,1.1406,6.5187,3.7873,4.7022,3.5621,3.0862,0.5233,1.8319,5.5553,0.0169,3.0914,3.7521,2.5054,2.8087,0.8985,3.6373,0.6596,2.6843,0.0347,0.0058,2.6455,4.5428,0.8452,1.9003,0.0362,0.0569,0.503,4.1847,1.876,4.0187,2.5958,2.5029,1.3586,4.9993,0.0309,2.727,1.9323,0.5086,3.7459,1.9596,3.1184,2.8917,1.9226,5.47,0.4385,1.8315,1.1931,0.211,5.5453,0.7011,4.1566,0.1806,1.336,3.4909,4.661,1.7025,0.4556,6.3698,0.5627,5.8252,0.0721,2.486,5.2207,4.4179,0.0919,0.8755,3.3393,0.9872,5.3173,4.9276,3.7214,1.619,1.2636,0.5169,3.4626,0.0003,3.4017,2.6974,2.5958,1.4173,3.7939,1.6695,3.8444,0.9936,1.6605,2.1378,4.3312,4.2825,1.4482,3.1917,2.3392,6.0392,0.3583,0.0034,1.6871,1.4416,0.8798,3.4751,2.5894,2.5088,3.2961,0.1484,5.7042,6.4782,0.282,0.0003,0.0022,2.6583,1.0616,5.7516,0.0219,4.2619,0.6461,1.0246,5.1905,2.9027,5.5207,0.6167,1.9823,0.6918,0.8397,1.9561,3.3604,4.6865,4.7745,4.7668,4.8393,1.3751,4.9988,0.9282,5.1726,1.4528,3.105,3.9342,0.5497,3.6275,1.1761,4.0821,4.2374,2.7168,4.3315,5.1061,0.9368,3.0862,3.6147,2.9541,2.2727,4.9102,0.3442,2.7977,1.3218,1.5871,1.2621,2.6889,4.0539,1.6421,5.5747,2.0133,5.5367,0.1009,1.2375,1.6513,2.0154,2.0823,1.9997,3.713,2.0595,1.8671,5.182,3.0241,1.1906,2.1607,2.8759,4.4374,0.7779,1.6562,0.4461,2.5559,1.0621,0.0014,1.56,3.2531,0.2199,0.0008,0.139,0.0041,0.3133,7.3993,1.3263,0.3577,1.6424,0.0491,0.0013,0.0001,4.9912,2.7997,0.0167,2.6908,0.608,2.7909,5.885,2.2439,4.3818,0.7217,2.8004,0.0539,2.1464,0.1406,0.5077,2.7576,0.339,1.6679,1.1997,3.0088,0.7354,2.1241,2.5778,2.3494,0.9841,0.2531,5.3343,1.0301,1.7664,2.5261,4.2812,1.3274,2.6934,1.7096,0.0522,1.6262,4.4814,2.8108,0.3982,0.5674,3.8285,3.1892,4.9904,3.1244,1.8945,5.0822,0.4626,0.5832,1.3603,4.1085,2.6981,3.0236,2.9751,1.0604,4.8468,1.9278,1.0515,1.2064,0.2759,5.6017,5.5618,1.145,0.0786,0.6148,0.0325,0.0046,1.7914,1.8285,6.26,2.927,3.8442,1.0221,4.5713,2.4757,0.3695,3.251,4.261,4.434,5.7219,5.5791,3.8274,4.5716,2.7278,1.0199,0.727,2.0166,3.9462,1.5048,1.1131,3.9807,4.6177,0.0504,1.2517,4.1654,1.4663,5.3547,3.7022,6.5333,2.1799,1.7486,3.2213,0.5154,0.0187,0.7989,2.1197,1.1058,3.8518,3.9005,6.375,8.2774,5.2124,4.4872,2.1342,5.1112,2.6252,3.4678,1.8672,3.2645,2.7268,3.2282,2.7909,1.7926,5.8959,2.62,1.1269,1.7706,4.1282,0.1843,4.3419,0.1307,0.1006,3.1036,18.1426,2.3382,1.5207,4.2507,3.3962,1.0747,1.256,4.6101,0.3299,0.469]}

In recent weeks, Democrats have accused Trump of trying to obstruct what they called an effort to bring an end to trade pacts with Iran and Russia, which some said are key to stopping Iran's nuclear weapons program.\n\nIt also came after the president on Wednesday met with top Democrats to discuss how to close the government through tax cuts, tax cuts for the richest Americans, and other policy concerns.\n\nIt comes a day after the Trump Organization raised questions about whether it was considering a U.S. corporate tax increase in the wake of a Senate vote.\n\n\"The President of the United States should not let political considerations interfere with the implementation of American ideals of free enterprise and market leadership,\" the White House said at a statement Tuesday. \"The President also does not believe that political, ideological or material considerations play a role in what our government does in this country.\"","token_len":365,"entropy":[6.6897,2.7396,8.3949,1.1952,0.6611,3.9855,0.0006,0.0037,0.0644,3.559,4.3775,1.6961,1.6427,1.7735,6.1589,0.7438,2.1944,1.5035,0.0075,2.2212,2.1322,3.2784,4.1756,4.1775,1.9365,3.3072,0.8112,4.8493,0.0042,3.9191,2.4287,1.6295,4.4405,0.7543,0.2623,1.2041,3.8884,6.5764,3.2586,5.5485,1.3457,3.0952,0.0846,0.3924,0.2436,0.1355,0.0002,2.9334,0.0292,3.9133,0.019,0.0036,0.5522,0.2252,0.0296,0.1212,0.8186,0.7659,0.9799,1.6356,4.7695,4.1181,2.4598,2.2489,0.447,0.7718,1.5291,1.305,0.2095,2.0538,4.4192,0.8786,2.3775,1.4537,2.6379,3.7437,0.0033,5.375,2.9332,1.8257,6.2624,0.1691,0.1308,0.8356,5.5669,0.0835,2.0891,1.4477,0.6152,2.1167,0.025,3.4974,2.3184,1.0015,0.143,0.0002,0.4569,4.9727,1.8989,3.0072,0.0026,0.279,3.4097,4.2386,0.9177,0.8167,2.9704,2.3806,5.8781,2.0495,3.3912,0.1215,1.0381,0.1763,1.5892,1.0072,3.8588,0.6712,0.6604,2.3307,1.6609,1.3003,0.0204,2.9675,2.1494,0.9692,5.5903,1.301,0.0746,0.0002,4.7173,1.647,2.0015,5.648,3.539,0.4802,0.7915,5.0021,3.6643,6.448,0.0295,1.9323,4.6992,2.5219,4.5254,0.6624,3.2035,7.1984,3.2362,4.7616,2.633,0.5114,6.0161,0.0427,0.3763,4.2538,6.0299,2.1235,0.3945,0.5718,0.6727,0.0002,5.7163,1.4667,4.8703,3.4274,0.2376,4.6897,0.7421,0.3658,1.1065,5.8059,0.0004,0.1339,0.2234,0.0213,0.0456,0.9643,0.0349,1.6706,1.9725,2.3246,2.6555,3.4781,0.6347,0.7939,0.044,1.078,4.0087,3.0159,0.8157,0.1152,3.4864,0.3981,2.934,0.8295,0.1436,2.5756,0.0194,3.5167,6.1665,0.5039,2.8495,2.0731,1.5407,0.2037,4.0719,3.8699,0.3047,0.0045,3.3905,5.4394,0.0012,1.0001,0.8308,1.0856,3.299,2.0951,1.79,4.9031,4.6827,2.8521,5.022,0.1953,3.2185,0.749,0.7973,0.4373,3.3854,0.1097,0.0921,0.1275,0.0002,5.5481,3.1499,2.997,1.9038,2.1702,2.7498,3.5111,1.3599,4.1716,0.1702,3.666,3.0436,2.2487,0.6498,2.9991,0.4106,5.4335,0.6812,3.5827,5.4422,4.8294,2.0011,1.6028,3.3583,2.6544,0.2871,0.6714,4.741,0.1562,1.0059,0.5939,1.813,2.9107,5.6573,0.4152,0.3201,0.0002,5.222,2.722,2.9588,0.5637,0.1523,1.9547,4.5237,3.6376,4.9342,2.5994,0.1812,1.8547,0.9661,1.5368,4.8472,2.266,5.6928,0.0017,0.0028,0.4528,4.5434,0.4878,3.2921,2.4818,2.0642,0.5884,0.0017,2.354,4.3964,1.7643,3.2247,0.6703,0.0002,2.4266,2.0909,3.5769,3.9012,0.0849,0.0331,0.0017,2.3071,1.2139,6.2079,5.2649,1.8282,2.843,0.1437,1.2145,4.5045,0.038,5.7614,5.1727,2.0281,3.4588,0.4146,0.6375,5.3465,4.1073,0.2487,1.8187,2.1849,0.0023,0.116,5.4538,0.6814,5.4031,4.5023,0.3222,1.2848,1.8866,1.392,4.3541,4.1792,0.0027,1.2806,0.5248,4.2709,6.3234,2.6749,0.7399,6.1851,0.5685,3.919,0.2103,0.2161,0.0235,4.8672,4.2959,2.7269,0.4203,2.5582,2.1367,0.671,0.36]}

Andrew Jones, deputy U.S. military commander who coordinates North Korea's counter-offensive, said North Korea's approach could be the \"most important foreign policy decision since Vietnam, which was so important in the fight against communism\" but is now being \"destroyed by an international war\" by North Korea.\n\n\"Even if President Trump had a choice between two world leaders instead of China,\" as he had earlier asked, \"the choice between the United States and China is very, very clear.\"\n\n___\n\nMore World News, World News, Global affairs, Agence France Presse","token_len":366,"entropy":[9.148,2.1083,1.1813,2.0263,8.5224,3.2726,0.5962,4.8215,7.6315,1.0216,1.9819,6.807,3.977,0.0009,0.0712,0.0012,1.419,3.408,2.7883,0.0103,7.7484,4.853,2.9406,4.5216,0.0005,0.0641,0.0844,2.6872,1.7429,5.2894,1.8177,3.5094,18.5577,8.9172,7.7859,2.1746,0.4239,3.8757,3.001,2.3058,3.4703,0.7565,5.6327,1.6882,6.3351,5.2042,0.816,3.9351,3.8532,1.2165,4.0224,2.008,3.3401,3.8045,0.2427,0.6644,0.4192,0.6185,0.0002,3.8976,4.7005,4.3198,3.6307,2.3146,4.2264,4.4573,0.6608,2.1351,5.6738,0.4071,3.4445,0.4214,4.0657,5.8394,0.5956,1.1659,0.0002,4.3708,3.821,2.5995,5.9799,1.1302,2.7744,5.4174,0.2796,3.1671,4.1586,2.9816,1.3125,4.6068,0.5342,4.3827,0.738,3.3451,4.3936,4.1679,0.0391,2.7804,4.7104,2.6296,0.2364,3.1091,4.9558,3.0447,0.5168,0.641,0.0143,0.7966,1.2653,2.1098,5.4623,4.5292,0.7814,2.7682,0.0085,0.4231,2.5559,4.9164,0.6755,4.4615,4.1029,2.3335,3.0306,2.0996,2.5605,0.9072,0.8861,0.0002,5.763,0.0901,5.4121,0.0367,1.7645,4.3987,2.4272,1.7449,1.8376,1.7039,0.0682,5.0461,5.5449,0.0144,1.5379,2.8056,2.0588,4.7347,1.6044,0.3695,2.8244,7.2714,3.9321,1.0663,1.1324,0.0707,0.0039,0.105,1.2765,0.7921,2.3204,6.6994,1.612,1.8059,0.1235,0.2091,1.3393,2.8584,0.0751,3.8776,2.0017,3.0025,3.2918,0.5143,0.1558,1.7437,0.5326,0.0002,2.8519,5.1902,5.0109,2.1135,2.2653,5.0665,2.4658,4.9571,4.6967,0.9783,2.7047,1.3978,1.1484,3.6329,1.304,3.9425,1.6897,0.1236,5.7369,3.5831,2.0389,2.6208,0.9734,0.1465,3.8177,2.1224,5.0103,4.2986,0.0535,0.0245,0.0407,5.6066,0.584,5.3311,2.0374,0.2156,4.8113,0.1928,0.3414,0.0002,3.0816,3.9784,2.5338,0.8563,1.6443,0.5545,3.0208,3.3042,5.5509,0.6315,0.5287,7.075,4.0908,0.3853,0.3109,3.9493,1.653,4.1637,2.15,3.0654,0.2172,4.868,0.1525,0.3368,0.0001,6.0036,4.3457,0.0054,4.6683,5.0479,0.2359,4.0287,2.7083,0.0006,0.0064,0.0012,2.3596,1.3447,4.9851,4.8707,1.7142,0.1282,0.489,4.4633,0.7355,2.8246,0.9622,0.4961,2.9175,0.1272,1.3323,4.1347,3.6533,1.3549,4.4123,3.0896,2.4042,2.6341,4.1619,0.0262,1.405,3.326,3.2339,3.6313,2.7591,1.8625,5.2672,2.3827,2.6833,1.4321,5.2699,0.1124,1.3408,3.163,3.8968,3.435,1.4669,2.6701,3.4654,4.6019,0.0019,0.925,3.898,3.8885,3.7508,3.4391,1.6365,2.3165,0.1051,0.2006,0.1394,0.0002,0.6254,5.0576,0.909,5.0814,0.341,3.7237,3.1089,3.8027,0.8857,4.1692,4.3687,0.3366,6.7414,0.0439,4.9372,3.5529,8.2548,1.2627,3.6016,2.8879,5.9022,0.9459,0.4768,3.8578,2.1066,3.1755,2.3098,1.5763,0.0003,0.1634,0.5673,1.1003,2.6721,2.4299,0.002,1.211,0.982,0.4587,0.0002,2.7125,0.003,0.0003,6.2252,5.3668,0.4569,4.2724,1.1992,0.36,0.8212,4.1158,3.8926,1.1688,3.9972,0.5614,0.0012,2.3231,0.001]}

A senior state spokesperson, Najat al-Harithi, told the Guardian that it was a mistake to talk about Hezbollah as an active coalition force because they have a history of using the terms \"mainstream\" and \"moderate\" in reference to their interests.\n\nBut the Lebanese government had been vocal about its desire to keep fighting against Israel in Syria. \"It is in line with our policy of having no foreign powers involved in politics.

The American government initially denied that there was any attempt to influence the proceedings of the case.

The move was made on a \"high alert,\" as the fighting with Islamic State raged on, which it confirmed is supported by Russia.\n\nIslamic State is trying to drive a government controlled area of the northern Syrian city of Kobane, its outskirts south-east of Raqqah and the Islamic State-held border town of Shabwa.\n\nIt said on its TV news channel that its air force had bombed a mosque in the northern city of Sheikh Jarabulus and on several other villages and had targeted a military college in the north of the city.\n\nIn a further escalation of fighting, the militants launched a suicide drive near Kobane on 5 April, the first such attack on a military college since the Islamic State had been declared a military target in December 2014 and carried out similar operations in January and February of that year.\n\nWhile Islamic State remains at the center of many Syrian conflicts, Russia said Thursday it had successfully killed Islamic State-held areas in eastern Syria under the control of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and also the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in the country's north and south at the beginning of August.","token_len":371,"entropy":[8.1594,5.5726,6.7552,1.5974,2.0929,1.0845,1.3248,9.8371,1.1876,2.8586,1.9934,4.0299,1.4789,0.0045,1.6321,1.2403,1.6058,2.5637,5.3989,1.3067,0.5259,8.4107,9.8068,4.1039,5.9439,1.5413,3.5217,11.2444,0.2136,0.2046,6.715,6.2204,2.8225,5.5247,4.515,4.3671,0.6263,4.082,3.6795,4.3059,5.6177,0.2458,0.6777,2.4426,4.7652,0.0515,1.3012,2.4957,4.3751,1.9402,4.5504,1.2857,5.9313,4.7515,0.6812,0.3788,0.2531,1.9275,2.0082,5.4346,4.0115,0.7357,1.6385,3.6918,3.1322,1.1957,0.9457,0.0007,1.5843,2.1597,5.5754,0.0192,1.1167,3.7413,2.7119,2.7247,4.3616,1.7876,4.2698,5.2925,5.9989,2.4213,1.9721,4.2714,3.2831,2.841,3.2639,0.0031,5.3882,1.058,5.6171,3.5319,2.9406,4.9115,5.0765,2.0598,4.3482,1.0531,1.114,0.0004,3.5269,1.0295,4.083,0.9344,0.6767,5.0929,2.3804,2.5038,4.2266,5.7805,1.2874,4.2152,1.5797,4.6051,1.9644,1.4486,0.0069,4.3751,2.562,0.9275,0.0004,1.2067,3.4873,4.4164,7.2555,1.9603,3.5296,0.5159,2.8744,5.5212,0.405,1.287,1.4149,0.0027,2.2725,0.6698,0.4876,2.1962,3.7148,1.7934,3.4471,3.0692,2.5213,3.5464,3.0661,2.2117,2.7651,3.9716,1.3973,5.3793,5.1603,0.5643,0.001,5.3333,1.6856,2.1851,4.7547,2.9769,6.4529,3.7824,5.3765,0.028,2.1165,0.4882,0.3057,0.0002,4.2529,0.0021,2.845,5.0138,0.037,3.8981,2.5438,5.3021,5.9405,0.724,1.2361,1.9505,2.7024,0.3867,0.6913,0.0372,2.5262,1.457,1.5697,5.3479,6.4064,6.449,3.5782,0.402,0.5698,6.0142,0.0879,0.0021,2.5732,2.0903,4.7332,0.0852,2.5305,0.4369,3.8075,0.471,0.0182,5.6928,2.005,1.5068,1.0401,1.0787,0.0003,3.3095,1.3618,1.3099,2.8694,7.5304,2.8493,1.159,0.4965,2.6191,1.7937,0.6026,1.202,3.2462,1.7286,3.3376,0.826,0.9257,2.9276,1.5821,0.087,4.8032,0.2192,0.0673,0.0032,1.8054,4.6776,4.0044,0.9299,3.4141,2.95,4.1341,3.4993,1.2262,2.4879,5.6064,1.157,0.8653,4.3811,0.885,0.3856,0.3588,0.3951,0.5288,0.0003,3.4397,1.1972,5.2404,2.3305,0.6482,2.3027,0.8398,1.5076,3.7095,3.5241,0.8161,3.4532,5.5162,3.76,3.9073,0.0212,1.6096,8.4159,2.7026,0.8728,3.2616,2.2046,1.9201,1.2537,1.3771,1.7588,1.0855,0.7295,0.8065,1.2091,3.0584,0.0029,4.2956,3.4433,2.3052,0.5309,4.9192,2.2881,0.8676,3.5487,1.7209,3.9465,4.4631,0.0121,5.4131,2.8726,0.8495,3.2119,0.8889,0.2934,2.2556,2.2067,0.0174,0.1829,0.384,0.0004,5.7726,2.8248,0.0026,5.6377,2.8181,1.53,1.3034,0.012,3.6826,3.0421,2.3696,0.3214,3.5945,4.0635,4.4923,0.7306,0.9962,3.4284,4.5819,2.4337,0.002,3.7875,1.1398,2.1171,1.2648,3.8482,0.7389,4.6576,1.705,0.8788,0.0106,2.5281,1.903,0.0163,0.2641,0.0257,0.001,2.113,4.2214,4.3057,5.2387,0.3991,0.3512,0.0087,0.6413,0.0006,0.0002,1.0027,1.265,1.6963,3.7523,0.6194,1.9345,2.2959,1.2908,6.4431,0.8288,3.4229,0.0054,3.5311,0.2518]}

Paine, but with an eye to the next step.","token_len":372,"entropy":[10.4604,3.4578,4.7708,1.9137,4.1313,2.5287,0.1772,7.6873,0.61,2.449,4.8878,5.8933,0.0081,5.764,6.0885,0.3238,7.2297,4.5339,1.5051,0.0608,6.4027,1.6943,7.6258,7.0795,8.3785,2.6657,0.2856,7.3261,0.0009,0.7855,0.092,2.0634,5.2745,0.2907,6.0343,0.7715,0.0009,4.8748,0.0274,0.3945,4.3583,3.3924,5.0342,0.2505,0.122,0.8588,4.4558,5.2317,4.6289,0.0078,2.4596,2.8225,2.6218,2.2425,0.6148,2.8002,5.4344,5.3164,3.9303,2.1088,1.6706,4.5531,3.5273,2.8283,0.0031,3.738,0.7525,0.8813,16.0093,5.0251,4.0347,0.466,2.4148,0.2275,2.8432,2.5973,0.5209,0.0888,1.1229,2.7054,4.4808,1.1316,1.5168,1.0823,0.5882,5.8356,3.8637,5.7035,3.8899,5.0684,0.6853,0.0915,0.1042,4.1619,1.3,0.3334,2.4433,4.2064,3.9378,0.2264,5.097,2.1591,4.5371,2.2416,2.4078,5.5714,0.9121,5.9507,2.0078,0.6246,2.4101,2.0401,0.0836,0.3246,0.8382,0.637,6.0187,1.2983,1.5582,5.079,3.9342,1.7384,2.576,5.9128,0.1315,0.9422,2.9651,2.4242,3.9277,1.2171,0.027,2.1804,2.6825,4.5196,3.8453,2.3911,0.9736,5.1982,4.11,5.3275,1.9143,2.2589,0.0382,4.1109,4.498,1.3863,2.3037,1.521,0.414,0.3317,1.6534,2.2702,1.2173,1.4197,3.8987,2.0865,6.0339,2.7318,5.2661,3.3926,0.0393,1.0146,1.6127,0.0145,0.7415,0.0138,0.4133,4.3184,0.3668,1.8501,5.3747,1.614,5.7801,2.8501,5.141,2.0691,5.1554,0.5263,1.0308,0.0297,3.8305,3.7001,4.8321,2.8095,1.4677,5.2095,3.1873,2.4114,1.7599,2.5548,3.2682,1.9021,3.9146,3.9738,8.7993,1.2099,3.6505,5.3637,4.7943,1.6642,5.6327,0.1322,0.1085,3.998,3.6266,4.3276,1.6392,3.6062,0.5044,0.0132,4.1835,1.1166,0.665,2.2819,2.0513,4.8642,0.5882,5.5309,2.9771,5.1381,4.6663,3.2517,0.0105,3.439,0.7229,0.0025,5.6602,5.2404,0.9692,0.2172,3.577,0.0372,1.491,2.4363,5.1724,0.9417,4.7307,3.9863,5.2727,2.0157,2.5639,3.5206,1.4649,2.8571,0.1986,0.1208,1.0347,3.6197,1.322,2.3369,2.5244,1.4784,0.829,4.1058,1.6065,0.1757,3.5707,4.8371,0.0485,2.8426,0.0691,3.7039,0.8366,5.7506,6.012,1.9957,1.277,0.6119,3.7228,2.2118,1.3117,3.9375,0.2285,1.2717,5.6797,2.5218,1.4791,0.0151,1.0641,0.4188,4.6876,2.6868,5.1861,2.0931,5.3125,2.9394,1.6668,2.659,1.5066,0.0232,0.6533,1.0385,1.6912,6.0588,5.1277,3.2314,6.3068,4.4256,4.3098,4.2963,0.7055,0.5205,5.2542,0.4169,0.4642,1.7181,4.8969,1.4355,1.9251,3.0138,4.7928,1.9205,4.5169,0.1088,0.3495,1.3321,4.8071,2.081,0.0384,4.9728,3.7122,3.8196,2.1502,4.3086,2.5377,4.7785,0.2809,1.745,4.2229,5.1229,1.437,0.579,5.4793,3.356,4.3289,3.3736,3.3512,4.0747,4.8838,3.7901,0.1361,6.141,2.8361,1.3187,2.8081,0.0328,5.1146,5.1481,1.719,0.7077,0.6896,1.9876,2.602,3.3807,0.2119,1.2035,5.5695,5.206,2.37,5.3883,4.9742,0.9209,5.1956,4.2078,3.4993,3.2815,1.554,1.8686,3.8961,1.7828,0.8525]}

A few of the countries which have long sought Assad's ouster include Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Germany.\n\nIt is thought some governments have also received intelligence that Mr Assad's forces are planning to attack and assassinate senior figures.\n\nIn 2011 there were accusations of attempted coup d'\u00e9tat by Islamist groups against his government but Mr Assad has denied all such allegations.\n\nIt also came after Mr Assad was attacked by al Qaeda's Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in his hometown of Raqqah in May last year where the US State Department said Mr Assad ordered the attack which killed two US Marines.\n\nMr Assad has been in power since 2011 and has been forced out of power after an election in February that saw him swept away by a far more moderate Muslim Brotherhood than his predecessor.\n\nHe has struggled to retain power even now struggling with an Islamic insurgency which has killed more than 30,000 civilians in neighbouring France and other Western countries and also left more than 10,000 wounded after a siege in the Syrian city of Homs at the beginning of August.","token_len":373,"entropy":[8.9625,0.8887,10.4438,2.9192,0.0477,3.4726,2.5394,2.6395,2.9295,3.3764,3.0926,4.2392,7.2765,0.0995,5.4755,3.4111,5.0817,0.5256,2.444,4.7814,3.6368,1.8159,4.3665,11.3508,4.5641,0.3569,2.5203,1.3425,7.9354,6.0675,0.4358,0.3141,0.0232,0.001,11.0667,3.5424,0.2263,4.9375,4.638,0.7804,3.0293,2.5704,1.2369,3.7656,0.6283,0.4142,0.5507,0.0005,5.3316,1.0011,1.7059,5.1747,1.4656,4.9453,0.5997,0.9342,1.8252,0.6572,2.4174,2.2763,5.3855,2.7782,1.3742,6.2072,2.621,1.9443,3.6674,3.5828,0.277,4.3103,1.1147,1.9265,1.9242,4.9069,1.9178,0.8058,0.0003,5.3924,4.3623,3.4944,3.8545,3.6954,3.0263,6.3144,2.5903,3.0452,2.0466,3.8791,0.8229,5.4368,1.7495,1.3322,2.2247,2.0943,4.0755,0.4715,1.3463,5.5808,5.9111,2.3667,0.8024,0.0002,4.3998,1.1236,3.2242,4.5102,4.6091,2.2208,0.3863,1.2346,1.0583,5.0277,1.4395,0.0728,4.0614,3.1691,2.3376,4.1657,2.1993,2.0946,4.3782,5.5778,0.0326,2.3817,3.4248,5.9101,0.2283,4.8047,0.0324,3.7764,1.309,5.1936,1.6067,2.1108,1.6561,5.264,0.199,3.2143,0.6412,2.698,5.0315,1.1772,3.8911,0.7737,0.2715,0.0003,5.0958,0.2006,3.8461,2.1882,1.8578,2.1695,4.5086,0.1988,1.2592,3.9997,3.6769,4.1486,0.883,3.0574,3.5688,1.1365,5.2517,3.8462,4.6982,0.2662,2.2298,0.0108,1.8673,3.5307,0.2198,1.1646,0.0014,0.7596,5.2615,0.2438,0.4745,0.0003,3.4308,0.4895,4.9103,3.9726,5.7889,2.113,2.4311,5.5165,4.6945,0.9187,4.9374,0.055,2.212,0.5087,0.7654,1.9187,0.865,1.405,4.001,3.8131,3.951,2.5613,2.457,0.3922,0.0004,3.6252,4.9783,5.1595,0.4534,5.4533,1.2716,5.4579,2.678,1.1609,0.0058,0.5015,0.0065,1.7429,3.6483,2.6279,2.8278,4.2377,0.5408,2.2848,2.9755,0.049,1.788,0.8317,3.077,1.4555,1.1022,0.3132,0.3587,0.0004,4.0442,4.2289,3.8604,1.8893,3.0487,0.2213,2.7668,5.4611,0.7036,4.4734,1.1205,1.9976,4.2195,2.3781,0.0413,0.0923,0.0013,0.0001,0.0001,1.4549,3.4625,2.7183,0.0769,4.0629,0.2431,0.0029,1.5733,3.5773,2.7201,0.0022,5.8727,2.9307,2.9773,4.4253,0.0101,1.3695,3.4183,1.764,5.1012,1.1077,1.2604,5.4181,0.3883,3.7334,1.6361,4.0429,0.3711,0.3659,0.0003,2.3653,0.2989,1.2508,3.032,2.7693,0.9736,0.6775,2.1496,1.0984,1.0565,1.6983,3.9845,2.0206,0.6612,0.1785,1.6654,3.6599,3.7899,1.2119,2.9661,2.2226,1.6489,1.4721,4.7282,4.1925,0.3408,2.1651,5.2144,2.1575,2.0482,4.4861,2.3195,2.9524,1.7556,0.8028,0.8858,0.4358,0.0006,2.7122,1.0842,5.0481,0.3229,4.5664,0.3264,4.6229,5.1201,6.2931,1.2106,3.2311,5.0424,1.4633,2.0347,0.8376,1.4883,1.1818,0.0169,3.5923,0.0361,0.0012,3.8755,1.914,5.7555,7.1509,0.849,3.7585,1.7495,0.5293,2.867,4.6687,4.4465,2.5672,0.0172,3.6275,0.1499,0.0149,2.3454,5.0404,1.4882,4.3464,2.2794,1.967,3.1649,1.1348,0.0102,2.1156,6.0811,0.3119,2.677,0.0037,3.2173,0.2576]}

We are aware of the threats against us from some members of the settler community living in the region.\"\n\nIsrael's rightwing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday tweeted condolences to the president, who had already called for his suspension.\n\n\"We are angry with the Trump administration's decision today to cancel a planned holiday in Jerusalem because of opposition that included Palestinian rights organizations and others who have advocated against Israel's policies like the recent wave of attacks on Jerusalem,\" Netanyahu said on Twitter. \"Let them understand that our actions by taking a stand against what our government considers antisemitism are against both Jews and the state of Israel.\"","token_len":374,"entropy":[10.4227,1.7514,2.9762,6.1145,5.6227,5.7316,2.1781,6.5137,2.4462,4.8456,0.0307,0.2517,1.4934,3.1604,1.2594,2.0958,8.3592,5.6399,5.8978,1.6277,2.8752,3.7247,1.2884,6.5914,0.0417,0.2237,0.1403,0.6584,0.133,0.0031,10.4275,7.1382,0.0941,1.3602,0.0766,2.3709,11.7926,0.2067,2.4344,3.9131,0.2119,5.023,3.9359,0.8641,2.324,0.4638,7.7597,2.576,0.0283,11.416,7.5373,0.2063,3.3358,0.1475,2.7894,3.7955,1.5522,2.5396,4.2483,1.1857,3.0278,0.0005,0.0271,0.0211,4.2733,5.9824,3.7657,1.6831,2.0467,2.8241,6.3398,4.4837,4.5884,4.5133,1.0804,1.7829,4.0696,0.0025,0.4291,2.295,1.0667,0.293,3.8172,0.4161,5.2159,0.477,0.6271,0.0003,3.5499,0.0029,0.0009,0.0004,0.0002,0.0003,0.0001,0.0001,0.0,0.0002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0001,0.0,0.0003,0.0001,0.0001,0.0001,0.0049,0.0002,3.2707,3.5019,1.0781,0.6573,2.1135,2.8609,0.4597,2.7616,6.4852,3.6567,2.3156,1.5375,2.4588,1.1299,1.79,4.2535,0.0758,1.2644,5.3061,0.477,1.6867,5.5295,0.6761,1.4761,0.4172,1.3163,0.3731,0.0002,1.3806,3.5009,2.111,2.1172,2.6174,3.016,5.9252,0.0106,0.1123,1.3704,4.8004,1.5858,5.0526,2.2914,1.701,3.8771,1.3692,1.7364,0.6235,2.8762,3.9269,0.1486,4.633,2.2648,3.9078,0.9497,1.907,3.6227,2.5265,4.3334,2.2161,4.2333,1.7834,2.7816,0.2373,6.934,6.1464,1.8265,2.5803,2.5743,3.3308,1.3918,2.5505,0.4052,0.5693,0.544,0.0002,2.5909,1.8672,4.3864,4.232,2.1439,2.8255,1.4771,0.6331,1.9233,0.0332,3.775,1.1511,1.5528,2.4458,4.6355,1.7713,4.5149,3.3876,2.8095,4.5595,4.5458,0.0013,1.9084,1.2322,1.0343,6.9391,0.0411,0.2473,1.6316,3.9484,1.8663,2.298,5.637,2.2668,0.4331,5.7503,0.5893,0.5141,5.1091,5.539,1.5101,1.2009,3.3011,0.9801,2.0294,0.0008,1.7586,5.1419,4.1082,6.4731,0.5643,1.4656,3.6048,0.6829,1.535,4.9512,0.0028,1.4137,1.6363,6.2509,2.1601,2.7154,1.2335,1.8436,5.2742,0.8365,0.6772,4.4391,3.8495,2.1995,1.8152,2.6692,4.8851,0.0198,0.5287,3.1316,0.0004,0.5098,5.9589,0.4272,0.7037,4.4983,1.7925,0.1308,0.0002,3.9002,1.1551,4.7449,3.6373,1.9895,0.0029,0.0703,0.0006,3.3829,3.4329,5.2458,5.3851,1.0852,0.6345,6.0413,1.9278,2.0541,3.0729,4.9306,2.3239,0.7624,2.9165,5.7531,1.3329,0.3571,0.0002,1.2139,2.2425,1.5921,5.8052,2.4427,0.77,2.8222,0.2607,1.2297,0.725,4.9454,0.5331,0.9435,2.6284,4.2834,2.9369,1.8679,1.8865,4.558,0.6349,6.2555,5.8797,5.0245,4.7916,4.072,5.1172,1.2342,3.4337,2.0487,2.4494,4.4865,3.2222,2.4024,0.3196,3.3072,6.6019,1.399,3.8332,2.9045,0.0705,2.0953,1.0042,3.3332,0.708,0.7643,0.4886,2.7149,0.2565,0.1085,1.2317,5.9391,3.2335,4.1527,0.4422,3.0819,3.6089,6.3115,4.4836,1.8299,2.3509,0.3497,4.9496,4.4269,1.6246,2.3785,4.6571,0.0013,0.4124,1.9604,4.1073,4.6643,3.1524,0.0521,1.6773,0.9288,0.1757,0.2021,0.4355]}

At the State Department, the Obama administration said on Monday it would release further details of the White House conversations on the matter.\n\nIn the end, Trump hasn't shown much interest in working with congressional Republicans for a resolution to undo Obama-era regulations the administration has championed as necessary to fight climate change.

Hodges, a decision where the lower court ruled the state could provide legal protections to people who choose to serve the same terms in the military as heterosexual people.\n\nIn that case, North Dakota Supreme Court upholds the constitutionality of a law that bars discrimination on basis of religion.\n\nMore: The latest in a series of political news articles\n\nMore: First Lady Michelle Obama speaks about her time at U.S. Capitol","token_len":375,"entropy":[9.7655,5.8833,4.2658,0.0637,0.0533,3.9963,2.1053,4.8617,1.6857,9.0723,6.2847,3.9286,5.7282,10.0545,0.3281,7.2869,0.6004,4.5216,0.6119,4.5064,2.5681,4.6839,2.4348,1.9045,0.8661,7.4505,0.0099,17.6224,8.0314,6.7546,8.49,5.7391,2.9074,2.3164,3.4999,0.0009,6.8054,0.1801,2.5987,0.2332,3.3302,1.8015,4.7328,0.3526,1.8961,0.2592,1.1877,2.9416,0.3222,0.9435,0.1101,5.5955,0.347,3.4051,1.8451,1.5108,3.6936,3.373,4.3001,3.3104,0.5174,0.2441,5.0314,2.993,2.3318,1.3641,6.8052,0.4661,1.8643,0.4724,0.6086,0.0003,3.5506,2.8353,4.32,5.4607,0.5917,1.9634,6.5691,1.843,1.1368,6.0482,2.7625,6.0882,1.4068,4.6164,4.2849,0.3605,5.4226,4.3975,0.7826,1.3576,0.823,0.0002,3.82,2.5387,3.2321,0.8948,0.6652,4.8408,2.5194,0.1881,3.6318,3.72,1.8722,4.1938,1.9497,1.5497,6.272,4.748,2.4911,0.0067,1.623,1.052,5.9255,0.2917,1.1589,3.4005,5.1419,3.4805,4.6432,0.0072,0.0626,0.0022,4.321,5.352,2.428,2.3127,1.3841,1.8479,2.4001,5.4457,0.4594,1.97,0.0505,3.3331,0.4325,0.852,0.5301,0.0002,5.2982,0.8167,0.0012,5.3724,5.2713,5.0608,1.0661,3.8847,4.4696,1.58,4.7675,0.6116,5.1653,0.026,2.985,0.0185,1.8734,3.0755,5.826,0.1936,5.7266,2.3136,5.6104,0.0051,0.1305,2.9219,5.4757,1.3092,0.1739,4.8502,4.9026,0.0171,0.0265,0.6851,5.4046,0.8018,1.4359,5.1224,1.4673,5.4855,2.3756,2.0733,4.4073,4.9897,5.9523,2.1921,5.1678,4.0207,0.568,5.1609,2.9001,0.5738,0.2005,0.0002,0.2583,6.0242,1.9071,0.3265,1.9348,0.5363,4.3997,0.8443,4.6067,0.001,5.2042,4.4322,0.005,3.7301,1.8506,3.753,3.3857,2.9911,3.9306,1.5748,2.8661,3.252,3.5243,5.7047,6.234,4.4154,2.4449,2.5798,0.035,0.0021,0.0003,1.0041,0.4036,2.2772,3.7707,5.9073,1.3997,3.1204,3.592,1.5647,4.6763,1.962,3.2748,1.1243,2.6143,4.1509,0.2574,2.3311,2.7136,2.0495,0.696,0.5466,0.4478,4.9452,5.1768,1.1443,0.2646,0.0002,4.8004,3.5761,3.7769,4.98,0.5103,0.7619,3.1464,0.6592,0.3067,1.5952,2.3383,5.1601,1.3401,4.0669,1.4833,2.6908,4.8336,0.9587,3.2899,4.9253,5.554,5.2034,3.9165,2.9608,0.0007,1.4297,2.1832,1.7832,1.3502,0.0001,0.0,0.0352,0.0079,0.0004,0.0001,0.9695,2.7842,1.5931,5.6769,0.916,4.8603,0.3382,1.5322,3.2731,0.5387,2.8454,7.1728,2.4614,0.3402,0.4946,2.1138,0.7308,3.8329,0.4625,5.1242,6.3889,2.4174,5.9437,2.4666,0.7335,0.2525,1.034,2.3516,2.7086,0.8093,0.368,0.0002,2.8053,4.3081,0.1741,0.0355,5.4886,2.4546,3.2502,0.0022,9.3108,0.3388,1.3722,1.9474,0.0008,0.0077,1.6954,1.3998,0.7556,2.8062,2.7525,1.6817,6.9604,0.0034,6.0017,1.2262,1.0762,0.0002,5.7538,2.935,3.8784,3.9842,2.0355,1.6595,0.658,0.0923,3.965,3.1556,3.8186,1.596,0.0002,0.7424,0.0085,5.8441,5.7644,1.6808,0.0081,3.9014,2.8039,2.1479,3.967,2.9189,6.169,0.0949,0.0588,0.0231,0.4089]}

As with Hitler, he was forced to make compromises during times of political crisis and had to make compromises before he made a strong and strong decision he wanted to make.\n\nMacron could also have made a mistake by choosing the wrong man, but with the right leader, who he respected and believed could carry on with his old ways. That is why he was so successful\u2014especially on foreign policy, which is more about his policies than what he did. Despite being in a government that is deeply divided, some French voters seemed to be more impressed by Macron's foreign policy, and the new president's policy. As far as France is concerned, he should have taken a softer approach, so much so that the world reacted with disbelief.\n\nIt was in this light that Michel Temer was elected as Francois Hollande's first Minister of Education and after the election his ministry was transformed into an anti-immigration party, the Front National. Hollande became the first French president to enter public life in the French parliament and then won re-election to France's lower house in the 2006 election. Temer is now in power as President of HLS (the French Student Association), a coalition of universities that is dedicated to fostering a more stable, socially liberal and democratic France.

{"id":2432,"ended":true,"length":356,"gen_text":"A U.S. appeals court ruled on Friday that an Arkansas law restricting the use of the so-called abortion pill could proceed, overturning a lower court \u2019 s decision in 2015 that blocked the law's rollout in the short term. According to the Arkansas ruling, the state needed to prove because of the long wait for providers to begin operating across the state.\n\nLawyers representing the couple said that the state's abortion law violated those requirements because it did not require abortion providers to seek state and federal consent to terminate pregnancies using the pill.\n\n\"Arkansas does not offer that option to women who are suffering from life threatening or life threatening conditions,\" said David Woll, with the attorney representing the couple.\n\nThe case centers on Arkansas's 2010 law that, with exceptions, allowed some state residents to obtain abortions from a private provider. As a result, doctors can opt to have doctors in other states provide some form of non-abortion care. The state required abortion providers to pay a fee, and often they agreed, to administer an abortion.\n\nBut under the new law, Arkansas's procedure covered only abortion if a female's uterus was removed through a surgical procedure or if the mother was sexually mature and capable of delivering a child.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the lawsuit have argued that they would not have been able to obtain abortions if the state had taken its own position (the Court has only now ruled on these points recently), while their case against Arkansas was settled without an attorney.\n\nThe state Supreme Court granted the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction in January to put the law on hold pending any further appeals. The case will now be heard in state circuit court, and it is anticipated that the case will be decided before the end of August. The case is expected to conclude in May, when the decision is expected to come at the beginning of August.","token_len":378,"entropy":[6.9563,0.6281,0.0806,0.0846,7.0414,0.0201,2.0407,2.0972,1.7447,0.1333,4.1589,4.7977,1.8961,3.8033,1.9684,2.0221,0.0097,3.2851,5.6189,0.0088,0.0002,7.1831,0.1419,3.275,6.4792,2.8993,4.3479,0.0031,0.5275,1.5728,0.1401,19.408,8.5344,7.1674,1.7734,2.0289,3.6855,1.0684,4.2496,1.2499,1.1833,1.7565,3.9271,1.5706,1.7703,5.7093,0.2709,0.1714,5.8051,0.0031,0.832,2.145,3.8006,0.1617,0.8837,2.4695,5.2335,0.6704,1.8588,7.3453,1.7461,1.3042,5.0377,1.4335,1.1676,5.7935,0.2655,4.1274,5.2364,5.5166,0.4712,0.1519,0.7275,1.2112,0.0003,5.4399,1.4675,2.4473,0.9796,4.0607,2.2444,1.9831,1.5412,2.5123,1.5201,4.6817,1.0964,3.8205,6.3487,3.1642,2.2717,0.7276,2.5862,0.0193,2.9436,2.9192,0.4231,0.0629,5.0924,3.3319,5.2775,0.2315,3.8701,2.9891,3.2896,2.345,5.9015,0.6763,0.5064,0.4052,0.8251,0.0002,1.3879,5.2511,0.003,3.861,0.0494,4.9965,5.3663,1.0086,1.5559,1.8024,0.9987,1.5704,4.4402,0.4809,4.3447,2.8878,2.6998,0.7085,0.3568,1.2462,0.8794,1.0818,4.3224,4.677,4.8709,2.2471,5.8821,0.6562,5.7137,1.6152,0.9617,0.7472,0.4104,0.8208,0.0001,1.2312,3.3565,4.2152,0.5122,4.2388,1.8685,4.4335,1.0765,1.2106,4.7289,5.1525,1.8105,0.6771,2.3491,4.5032,4.0382,3.6103,0.2199,1.9805,1.7882,2.9379,2.2835,2.4566,1.3749,1.3524,4.9652,0.9627,0.13,0.1188,4.8557,3.4263,4.5871,3.0255,3.2194,4.4524,3.6685,2.3934,0.1088,2.8006,5.6675,1.3302,0.0015,5.4012,0.1485,0.7332,1.4171,1.3112,2.1377,2.101,5.2648,2.8729,0.175,0.2172,4.1527,1.5075,0.6851,2.8538,2.3411,5.6775,3.7857,4.0361,2.8432,2.7843,5.9027,3.8731,0.429,1.3356,0.4977,0.0002,2.882,5.1386,0.496,2.8093,0.1213,0.0723,2.6484,2.6005,5.7229,5.3407,0.4352,3.9179,4.2918,1.8327,6.1526,1.7662,3.6686,0.9143,2.6276,4.7754,1.229,2.1663,0.5819,2.6366,1.8863,0.938,3.4842,1.9367,5.4616,2.481,1.9959,2.6963,0.16,3.1838,0.5871,0.7137,0.4337,0.8659,0.0002,1.3729,4.2733,1.9844,0.1576,2.3887,4.5698,1.7458,0.1514,4.0843,4.0183,1.1404,0.8789,0.6339,0.5654,0.0133,1.0135,1.5327,1.172,0.7276,0.9971,0.4903,4.7601,3.7548,2.0397,2.2894,7.1992,2.4252,4.9376,3.7946,5.9299,5.7851,1.4872,0.467,4.7526,2.3244,6.5014,2.0281,4.6852,4.0536,2.7899,4.2858,2.2977,2.3581,3.5752,4.0043,3.2023,3.88,0.6225,0.3742,0.0002,1.3882,2.5286,3.5887,0.0125,5.0105,0.9458,0.9155,2.5793,1.2439,0.0225,2.0656,2.8648,2.2041,5.6623,0.584,1.4519,0.9258,0.2091,2.4002,6.5689,1.4015,1.9596,0.4045,1.654,2.3781,2.3812,1.1529,2.2284,1.0352,0.914,3.8941,5.4451,0.3402,2.0388,2.831,2.8991,1.2011,3.8307,0.3962,0.7591,1.4167,0.3294,1.0495,2.6821,2.4601,0.3998,0.9091,0.0006,3.701,0.2682,3.3159,2.3793,1.169,2.281,0.0302,5.5578,0.8844,3.1815,1.9447,2.7487,0.6563,4.5962,1.0786,1.0687,0.1182,3.1426,5.4186,0.6724,4.4872,0.0012,2.4993,0.1678]}

Not only for our people, us all,\" he added.The government said it had decided to propose reforms to the labour program as part of a new development strategy that is geared toward boosting job creation \u2014 and increasing participation and providing financial supports to employees. The government said it will unveil its plans at a cabinet meeting on Feb. 12, and the proposal was approved by the Senate. The government said the plan would set up a system of \"flexibility\" for the various services sector, aimed at providing long-term stability to the state.The measures have long been contentious. The government rejected the introduction of a tax to pay for social security in 1991, when the government was trying to raise money to make the sector more competitive and stable. Critics said the plan, which would have required a new tax, would reduce working conditions and give some of the state's wealthiest workers less support.The measure passed in the Senate on Oct. 13, but not before some observers had questioned its validity. Temer quickly issued a strong statement saying that it would not be put in place to give the government power to veto legislation which will set a new law. He said: \"Our country already offers free healthcare, free education, free housing and free health care. All we need today is for a change in this law.\"An opposition coalition said it would also pursue measures which it said will help boost the welfare state. Opposition senator and former minister of labor Alexander Noguel criticized the government, saying that the proposal would end up hurting businesses, and their workers. \"They should be rewarded with more than a little money and their working families better off.\"","token_len":379,"entropy":[8.3551,8.7079,2.2053,7.7613,7.9377,7.731,0.6853,3.1159,4.9842,0.8153,9.1963,6.1662,1.4437,0.4504,4.9666,1.8419,2.3264,1.2876,4.9611,0.6639,2.0046,11.5633,9.2508,4.2853,1.1804,0.1011,4.7678,5.9977,1.9448,7.6187,3.6503,0.0426,0.0128,0.7284,1.2143,2.0443,5.0054,5.6203,2.4627,3.3204,0.8024,0.1636,3.5053,1.456,1.5812,3.0398,4.9111,3.9882,4.7892,2.3459,5.8853,1.0529,2.994,2.6238,2.482,0.7823,7.428,4.0647,1.2246,0.4539,4.1106,0.4378,5.0939,2.9321,3.0705,0.9193,1.7443,4.629,0.4916,4.7767,2.8412,1.0774,0.9098,6.3942,4.9372,3.7805,0.7824,0.001,0.9703,3.9257,4.8667,2.1631,2.6727,3.2583,5.0738,1.0644,2.927,4.1429,0.2985,7.0753,2.4596,4.7762,4.3404,3.5765,5.7784,3.9248,5.1639,0.9499,5.417,0.8747,2.2183,1.8401,1.7674,0.7594,2.7312,5.3626,1.3668,2.3135,2.9876,0.7151,3.0172,0.0534,0.934,3.9559,0.0219,3.3977,2.2233,1.9241,2.3722,4.3834,2.4864,1.851,0.8306,1.0574,3.6961,1.5819,2.4958,1.6817,1.4943,1.7624,3.0474,1.5876,5.3498,1.8066,0.6252,3.0555,1.0065,2.9222,4.6333,0.9443,1.268,1.7013,2.2453,5.5523,3.7506,5.0714,1.3729,6.3118,0.0395,3.1264,5.0093,0.0579,0.0457,3.4712,1.4651,0.9365,4.2217,1.3313,1.6799,4.8374,3.6157,5.5768,0.362,4.6458,1.7552,2.3431,1.7775,5.0482,1.9585,6.1145,0.0887,1.0858,4.7123,2.9668,1.8064,0.0536,2.5674,0.4325,2.893,4.807,0.6423,3.7245,1.4715,2.7035,2.0131,2.9013,0.0057,3.4083,2.0157,1.2664,4.884,2.0576,5.9133,0.8538,1.2546,2.6902,5.0199,0.3138,3.5961,1.6106,0.7776,3.0258,3.5681,0.6661,1.7085,0.8322,2.8404,1.7306,3.364,1.7433,1.3172,1.4052,5.2222,5.3133,1.4509,1.036,4.8374,4.1343,3.2521,0.1586,2.8629,0.0339,3.267,1.553,1.8698,3.8279,0.8365,2.2498,4.1782,2.7496,2.5107,1.1202,0.7101,1.5954,4.7046,0.0053,3.5925,0.9479,0.8769,4.1891,0.407,4.0098,4.5917,2.9909,2.4732,1.9041,3.0594,0.3236,2.1641,0.0139,5.8056,3.6242,0.3139,4.247,1.6384,1.5486,1.8478,3.2573,1.8413,1.4194,1.234,5.374,2.146,0.6509,2.506,4.5234,1.7844,1.5959,4.5833,0.4542,5.1453,1.6551,6.0882,5.0021,5.2737,2.4237,1.906,3.7863,1.0826,2.955,0.8204,4.4471,0.0929,4.1801,3.0604,6.9399,4.9231,4.974,2.6683,1.381,2.3291,0.8727,0.5772,0.5312,2.5699,1.1069,1.0938,1.4457,0.4482,1.1486,4.2398,3.9058,1.2908,5.1432,0.1903,1.9229,3.0694,3.3045,1.0879,2.6175,3.265,1.1517,5.3694,2.1265,2.5508,2.6796,1.8581,1.2939,4.1816,4.9868,3.8099,3.7355,2.7618,0.7558,3.784,3.2343,3.1053,1.2487,4.0895,0.9343,0.8375,3.7116,5.4553,3.8562,1.629,2.5928,1.1996,4.546,4.872,4.3084,4.5327,3.7532,5.0848,0.3999,1.0306,3.632,0.3885,2.11,1.31,2.9134,1.2339,5.4876,1.1851,3.1789,4.701,1.984,2.668,6.1467,1.6474,0.6162,1.3412,3.8928,3.3379,1.4863,4.9172,1.4723,2.5368,3.784,1.9563,3.4391,2.4473,2.6759,4.398,5.0379,3.1889,4.0954,0.6959,3.684]}

The incident is reportedly the latest in an ongoing ongoing row between the South and North over the safety and security of North Korean border waters.Earlier this week, the South and North accused each other of deliberately sabotaging a ship in April this year after both sides threatened to cut a joint naval drill in the sea.","token_len":379,"entropy":[7.1918,5.4394,3.5885,8.3318,5.5881,2.208,6.0067,0.13,3.4522,2.1231,2.3972,2.0763,4.5882,1.7497,8.5788,1.4186,0.7212,8.1081,2.1116,3.8336,4.0315,0.0004,0.0059,0.2047,1.475,9.1074,0.3492,1.8205,0.0018,1.7237,3.0059,4.1483,1.9987,8.7446,5.8321,4.4491,11.2301,2.1156,0.8666,1.7331,0.8355,1.8563,0.81,0.1416,4.9272,1.3954,0.0444,0.4802,7.8376,1.156,1.4374,5.041,1.0655,0.1826,1.2434,6.7538,5.1858,4.3752,5.3076,1.5517,0.2479,0.6536,1.3254,1.3156,4.7596,2.4021,3.1617,0.9662,0.4833,2.0499,1.9713,3.0689,2.3529,0.6852,0.0,0.105,0.0135,0.3421,2.1153,1.2588,0.133,2.9619,2.2599,2.5144,0.5721,5.6408,1.9302,0.1026,3.076,1.284,2.9598,1.4363,0.1584,1.1168,5.4584,2.9754,2.3457,1.0645,0.3303,5.444,2.1303,1.3692,1.2487,3.3802,1.7103,2.655,1.3914,0.0222,4.5519,1.4979,1.5608,3.987,3.4474,2.1902,5.3119,4.2681,0.8586,1.8648,3.2004,1.4695,2.0273,0.0005,0.9054,0.4964,3.8109,2.4744,2.1134,2.8847,0.2017,3.8065,3.7047,5.9786,1.8929,0.1276,1.3075,5.5937,3.354,3.289,4.5441,0.76,2.3257,1.7317,0.0007,4.3966,1.4303,2.5944,0.373,4.7233,2.6504,4.0015,2.4089,0.0635,2.6894,5.0221,0.0089,0.0029,1.0006,2.0553,5.4554,1.3734,1.8877,1.5999,2.1476,0.1284,4.0344,1.1551,3.427,5.4367,0.1956,1.7138,0.0646,3.7808,4.7748,4.7554,1.9791,2.5314,0.3867,0.1005,3.0401,1.9519,2.9067,0.4729,5.7328,4.9374,2.7377,2.6266,1.6436,1.3906,3.5292,5.5382,0.2184,1.0207,1.5182,3.2865,1.5053,0.1329,0.2354,4.0566,1.2977,1.4044,0.0631,2.0709,0.7175,1.9754,4.7941,3.9393,0.3323,1.8484,0.2184,2.4803,3.9864,3.477,2.208,4.8385,3.2032,5.5171,4.7616,2.7965,1.976,2.5192,2.3457,3.2975,0.9409,1.6613,5.0443,5.3118,2.9447,1.7077,2.6978,2.3608,4.4477,2.6631,0.9872,2.9902,1.6772,0.9544,0.1071,5.7816,2.8118,5.6198,2.5087,2.4567,4.9437,0.4024,2.3506,3.4593,2.5973,0.0279,6.4822,1.5867,4.185,0.1409,1.0274,0.0003,0.4908,1.2963,5.404,1.6953,3.3339,5.2029,2.789,0.052,2.9541,5.6798,3.4496,1.5775,2.4674,5.6942,0.1583,2.9101,2.9866,0.9717,0.7373,1.0303,5.9055,0.9943,3.574,0.0766,3.4089,1.0489,2.0531,5.9217,0.0007,1.5418,0.2969,5.1115,4.9472,3.1607,0.5666,3.173,2.4683,2.6949,2.897,3.5451,5.7298,2.737,5.6213,4.3249,2.7364,1.8425,0.8004,1.8551,2.8741,0.8265,0.1469,0.2028,0.7806,2.8098,1.8408,0.1454,1.9315,6.4887,5.2927,1.049,0.0409,1.8612,1.712,5.019,2.5068,4.7105,1.2343,0.6686,0.8856,2.818,1.1639,5.6237,2.9607,0.8484,0.963,3.7216,0.1184,0.7883,0.6022,1.1692,3.7221,2.1884,0.3946,0.0128,2.682,0.2993,5.6669,2.1715,0.3726,3.96,0.3747,1.7781,0.08,1.8261,1.5553,2.4655,0.5502,3.7565,0.3517,0.0052,0.0758,5.4505,3.4462,0.0037,2.0835,3.4755,2.4874,6.5717,4.5745,0.0045,3.258,5.12,0.5703,3.414,0.3448,3.3202,4.6128,2.2254,1.9306,1.8526,2.1319,0.7985,4.5799,0.7737]}

Chinese firms working in the international tech community are also trying to expand into North Korea and other developing countries by partnering with local talent.In the past few months, North Korea has been providing some of the world's most-successful startups with technology, investing an estimated $45 per share in technology companies and training the country's 10,000 young scientists, scientists and engineers, but with increasing political and economic tensions, such support may not translate well on its own.","token_len":380,"entropy":[12.3505,8.0126,2.9694,5.147,1.6646,3.0714,0.0911,1.6851,5.7326,1.4668,7.4365,5.3081,5.9154,1.0108,2.1609,7.1022,7.1428,5.0145,1.0524,0.0029,5.5451,1.7112,4.8694,0.2759,0.3711,2.5151,0.658,1.0399,1.6349,3.936,2.9296,0.5351,0.0023,4.2765,1.6743,0.0144,0.6863,1.4148,0.1046,6.5563,2.9419,4.9458,0.378,1.4428,4.137,3.6818,3.5866,0.5235,2.1486,0.9479,1.6334,1.4486,2.0678,0.0361,1.6098,0.0394,5.0669,0.1797,0.0511,1.7288,0.0009,4.7648,1.2984,3.5574,0.2468,2.5394,1.657,1.7311,2.3181,5.6612,0.4451,0.002,3.4781,1.0124,3.3468,0.6923,1.565,0.001,6.0616,6.6508,6.1359,1.5808,1.4826,3.1654,3.0592,3.1222,0.9552,0.0085,1.4175,0.5607,2.2108,0.0018,4.9395,0.4191,0.1275,0.3069,2.4087,2.5773,4.8447,5.6947,2.8471,2.9208,1.6151,0.0007,5.2859,0.0783,0.4184,3.8637,1.6877,0.4265,5.8158,0.4096,2.285,0.472,1.2396,5.2645,4.5943,4.2003,0.8351,5.071,0.1918,4.1293,1.2921,1.415,6.3421,2.9575,1.2315,0.2311,1.1194,2.7019,1.896,4.9287,0.0075,1.4511,3.0293,0.0211,2.0688,0.034,0.0013,1.2929,2.805,0.0024,5.2572,2.6947,5.814,1.9833,2.5791,1.883,3.4728,3.6925,1.8808,3.8909,3.9495,4.2988,3.0622,4.3542,0.4736,4.5064,0.9607,1.2192,1.5725,2.001,0.0343,4.8658,0.8089,0.7252,1.3737,3.6586,1.2016,2.7166,0.0015,1.8122,4.4726,0.1122,5.1626,3.0031,1.7673,2.7885,1.1955,2.3504,4.8744,1.8781,2.3154,2.6711,4.9903,2.3172,2.1567,1.1582,4.6002,4.4059,2.7218,5.9789,3.3579,1.1262,3.8427,5.5238,4.3287,1.2696,2.5624,1.3575,0.937,0.2855,1.4305,0.0994,0.7784,0.2807,4.5701,4.8008,0.0003,0.4482,0.0891,0.0517,3.2636,1.3223,0.209,3.8372,3.8329,2.6595,1.3351,6.557,4.8465,3.9152,1.3716,0.3967,0.0213,0.6197,2.3199,3.2277,1.4788,3.4037,1.8035,3.5032,0.0703,1.4736,4.989,0.7759,3.9209,0.0029,3.3213,1.6321,1.9535,0.5393,4.8393,0.2427,2.5413,0.2627,1.2415,0.0229,1.3164,5.5924,2.2847,1.1408,3.7702,4.8923,2.9811,0.5492,5.1011,0.8246,1.3956,1.9489,1.3874,4.4861,1.5147,0.7237,4.9915,1.4554,2.5696,2.1295,5.0473,4.9473,2.2517,2.8955,3.7065,4.0594,2.8215,1.3245,4.2939,0.392,2.0347,3.1189,4.1224,1.5842,1.6596,0.5311,0.0101,1.4362,0.3466,5.5193,1.5987,5.3261,0.7026,2.6245,6.1895,3.5878,4.3868,1.2808,1.1625,3.4795,0.037,3.573,2.7756,0.6214,0.0413,2.8619,2.5925,2.3076,0.5699,3.4781,4.7483,0.1098,2.9028,5.5341,1.3446,2.8575,1.8303,1.1183,1.9493,0.7181,0.0808,2.42,0.3454,0.4636,1.8413,5.3487,2.9502,0.7554,0.5685,1.8323,0.0059,1.0583,5.1334,4.2965,3.2908,0.3953,3.4738,1.7261,5.4316,4.9402,0.1853,0.4045,5.3097,8.588,3.596,0.5126,5.2742,1.256,3.0168,4.1285,4.512,1.4778,0.0114,5.4263,0.9347,0.0746,4.3306,4.0846,1.9656,2.4722,0.6229,0.3062,1.5015,5.9637,4.4878,5.6144,4.6893,1.7909,0.2274,1.9686,1.7153,4.121,5.2055,3.1522,1.1433,3.9553,2.8135,4.2069,0.5703,0.0379,0.6723]}

He also said he believed China s military presence could influence foreign policy in the region, especially since the island has always been threatened by China.\"Taiwan has been threatened by China because it has sent tanks, artillery, naval ships with air defence system, and aircraft carriers for use against China,\" Ma said. \"Moreover, China can target any government group with military facilities like our Taiwan territory, and even its air force, especially the Taiwan People's Army is capable of providing military training, and there is no need to have the Chinese military in Taiwan, so Taiwan s military activity won't change,\" he said, adding that Taiwan was also able to obtain a peace treaty from the US and Japan, making China a \"special partner\".Ma said Taiwan is very worried because of its location where the military presence continues. China has declared its intention to set up an independent National Guard and establish an air force, while Taiwan ransoms it the money to provide defence for military operations in the area.\"China's territorial claims in the region do not represent that the US or any other party can stop it. What the United States thinks will happen is if Taiwan is attacked, the US will declare Taiwan a 'foreign enemy state' by taking it over and putting Taiwan firmly in its place.

Oren news agency, but cannot request information from RIA executives.\n\nIn the modified version, RIA also says public broadcaster RIA National will only talk to its users, while TV channels with similar information can go forward and provide no information.\n\n\"The bill takes into account the need to protect private interests that are important to any party or government that seeks to manipulate the system to influence it, and the importance of the individual rights of individuals, not the interests of media and media corporations,\" the RIA said in a statement.\n\n\"We believe that there is little scope for such manipulation in the information flow process.\"","token_len":382,"entropy":[9.7594,2.5921,5.3582,3.7002,2.4709,2.7567,0.8345,5.1324,8.6363,1.0338,6.0309,0.0205,0.0695,0.4636,6.6623,2.0135,0.1712,5.4974,1.6586,8.2191,0.7132,0.7694,0.3006,1.7742,7.3689,1.8591,3.9517,0.0469,3.983,2.3605,6.9313,1.5234,5.5981,0.3055,0.2773,4.8216,13.2045,5.5885,6.0587,0.8789,3.4957,0.4078,0.0237,2.8101,0.5756,6.5862,0.1379,0.5931,0.2155,0.0003,1.4465,1.8762,2.3556,2.454,4.685,2.4595,3.2677,2.4178,4.8783,2.2475,1.9443,2.3049,1.7607,3.6918,1.9585,0.3785,3.1631,1.7676,4.4576,0.6273,0.4705,5.4104,3.5816,1.2858,4.3941,0.2456,1.6881,2.3296,1.2703,0.1871,1.4419,4.4572,2.3127,5.8555,0.6126,0.422,0.0003,2.6817,5.7863,2.3135,5.3929,2.448,5.4391,1.2266,4.2498,0.642,5.2561,1.4453,5.0822,2.1887,5.36,2.3764,5.4078,5.6182,5.9775,2.5632,1.7122,2.2608,4.7759,1.3304,0.904,5.043,4.5331,1.23,3.458,0.2063,0.5795,5.1828,0.1735,5.2308,4.6334,0.1657,4.12,4.3045,2.8251,0.8332,0.0417,0.389,0.2473,0.0002,1.5217,4.4972,5.7542,4.5115,1.2427,1.4491,4.8337,2.7258,4.79,2.525,5.1843,1.1186,1.0903,4.8352,0.1064,3.2753,5.3785,1.6104,0.2838,1.7252,0.2381,3.8043,2.1209,1.252,5.6852,2.6824,2.9857,3.1669,5.3173,0.1424,3.6933,3.9117,1.7863,5.7929,5.1616,4.8126,4.662,1.4544,0.7424,0.318,0.0003,1.3957,2.0552,2.9274,0.7465,3.1321,3.4959,0.2708,3.8701,2.2947,2.115,0.7094,3.235,0.9692,1.613,3.7083,3.2455,5.8187,4.0686,1.6045,2.8562,2.794,3.7566,0.5522,5.8385,0.5516,0.0515,0.8077,3.6921,1.2188,0.7853,0.4965,0.0002,3.33,2.8717,4.6576,0.6259,1.4681,0.1088,1.0633,7.5606,0.1005,0.9356,4.8443,2.9624,5.7057,0.755,3.5923,1.2148,3.639,4.2822,3.6199,5.2956,3.8508,1.9312,0.922,3.0122,2.4025,1.7137,0.0514,2.4487,3.1338,3.1132,4.4841,1.8495,0.9485,4.4148,3.1473,3.5315,2.0794,4.6703,1.3383,5.3832,0.7413,1.4678,3.1281,0.1165,5.2429,3.4506,4.5501,4.4729,3.9602,6.7958,2.7345,4.5499,0.5682,2.2278,4.2794,3.875,2.3179,2.6176,1.6066,4.8668,0.0487,5.062,1.3019,0.2094,0.0002,3.2335,2.1122,6.3445,0.1338,1.2365,2.72,0.0079,3.998,2.1644,7.0375,3.0399,1.5845,0.3009,5.7712,2.3413,3.2263,5.8512,0.5545,2.0392,2.5216,3.4635,3.2711,3.5554,2.7043,4.5925,5.5791,4.7902,2.4445,5.1934,4.6779,3.1685,3.8221,4.9273,0.9565,0.9059,0.2779,0.0002,2.6544,1.7908,3.7204,5.5844,1.3316,0.2624,0.9022,3.5492,0.9121,2.0234,5.1257,3.1845,4.7488,1.4278,3.3178,0.4013,5.7347,3.5949,2.1262,2.2332,3.9791,2.909,0.1824,4.7991,1.0421,3.6434,2.8408,3.6627,4.7649,2.2387,1.1987,1.8696,3.1643,0.1693,2.1799,5.0386,3.2303,0.4552,2.7798,2.4601,3.4167,1.4473,1.3618,0.0208,3.6698,2.4452,2.013,2.9226,0.2666,1.7101,3.849,0.0119,1.2838,0.4739,0.8889,0.2022,0.3447,0.2995,0.0002,2.5984,2.7799,3.0713,0.7144,4.2124,0.7611,4.9584,4.786,0.2328,2.9681,4.1577,2.1242,0.7984,4.6554,4.6915,4.0208,2.1818]}

{"id":2668,"ended":true,"length":358,"gen_text":"Egyptian authorities have detained 15 people pending an investigation into an attack on an unlicensed Coptic Christian church in a village south of Cairo, a security source said on Sunday. Dozens of Muslims and Christians have been killed in the attack since early Wednesday on a Coptic church, which was reportedly intended to promote Islam and preach harmony between Christians and Muslims.\n\nPolice in several areas of Cairo reported gunfire and tear gas near the Coptic Temple on Sunday. The source said Christians and supporters of the group were also attacked. The killing on Sunday was apparently sparked by a video message that urged people to remain calm and to pray for the \"God we love.\" On Twitter, many people who were present were outraged and threatened with execution on Monday for speaking out against the attack, with one such user tweeting: \"For any one of you who will know God, the only true God is you.\"\n\nEgypt is trying to contain the terror network Boko Haram, but that is expected to take longer and is unlikely to be successful. It remains to be seen whether authorities have the information to stop the group from growing into the Islamist group it once was.\n\nThe attacks in Cairo also include the arrest of three Coptic Coptic Christian women who had told journalists they were carrying messages from the group. Authorities said they hadn't been asked for help through the local emergency services. The incident was the first in Africa to lead to the arrest of the Coptic woman, who has been living in the country for 18 years.\n\n\"The main motive behind the recent attacks on Coptic Christians and members of Egyptian Coptic Christian community is self-interest, and our priority will only be to prevent further damage to the Muslim world from further destabilizing, and prevent further attacks on other Muslim countries on our continent,\" said Egyptian Interior Minister Fatou Bensouda.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.","token_len":382,"entropy":[6.2525,4.3143,1.628,5.1653,5.0155,1.1503,7.3059,2.7428,0.3389,0.4072,4.1025,3.0487,0.6894,2.4388,7.0641,1.7676,8.4987,0.0126,1.0499,0.9619,0.4705,4.0138,3.3883,3.4845,0.0255,1.025,1.326,2.8528,2.944,0.2383,0.6835,1.0254,1.4338,0.1265,7.6015,0.2336,5.6489,2.0344,0.5024,1.4763,0.2322,0.4609,0.704,1.1043,2.614,3.2305,2.4591,3.899,4.6169,0.7552,1.2568,0.0073,0.8737,2.4975,1.601,1.3706,3.9428,5.7676,0.3955,3.3666,3.069,1.7693,4.9785,5.1529,1.4241,1.5268,0.0429,0.5737,0.2848,0.7968,0.0002,3.9866,2.8397,5.9064,2.6973,0.8787,1.0297,3.7765,5.5923,1.3456,3.6817,0.0946,4.9865,0.2391,2.9799,0.0038,5.6357,1.8184,1.0068,1.5286,2.0857,4.0084,0.7307,5.4814,1.7972,5.2552,0.3097,0.5789,3.0476,1.5038,2.3803,2.212,0.9737,2.509,5.5123,5.4473,0.2176,1.679,5.2948,4.2118,0.0724,1.3826,3.8911,4.3545,3.0822,5.9068,2.521,0.2103,5.0772,1.6487,1.1264,1.7834,1.8541,1.0979,0.9107,2.9394,3.7027,6.1238,0.7257,0.8565,6.2535,3.4382,0.1202,3.3668,2.5386,4.7187,2.5121,3.2057,3.4171,3.5225,2.8844,4.6198,1.0714,4.5417,4.3443,1.743,3.1768,3.5779,0.1839,0.6403,0.3439,1.3954,2.3121,4.0605,2.044,5.0019,3.2363,2.3405,0.8168,0.1179,5.7278,5.6043,4.3846,1.8023,0.6142,0.6872,4.3486,5.8441,3.62,1.1094,4.1161,3.1796,4.5953,0.6218,0.9751,3.156,1.4229,0.2954,0.0002,2.317,2.8746,5.8668,0.0562,3.0156,0.664,5.2576,6.0294,4.8261,0.0001,0.5121,3.8779,4.7657,2.5806,4.5729,0.0212,1.6704,2.956,3.1452,4.4261,2.8559,0.0253,2.1357,2.6401,0.5289,3.9787,4.4543,1.007,0.001,0.001,0.9471,4.6587,3.7997,1.5961,5.3216,0.6165,2.2614,0.5206,1.8672,1.2279,4.7401,2.6723,2.9456,3.7711,1.0194,1.3072,1.9107,0.7181,0.4895,0.5043,0.0003,1.9248,3.7392,2.2459,1.5815,4.9528,4.97,1.2083,3.621,0.1662,2.9934,1.935,0.0602,3.308,0.4134,1.9775,2.9656,1.7732,2.3836,5.0934,4.9127,0.8651,0.7581,5.476,3.6453,1.9903,0.9377,0.9352,1.4709,4.8554,1.5718,1.08,6.7646,0.0008,2.358,4.9371,2.7247,4.2008,6.8247,0.904,3.1546,5.7616,0.3733,1.0895,2.7169,5.2023,2.3129,1.565,2.0091,2.3561,6.199,0.9861,4.5939,0.1663,1.5884,0.6998,0.1221,2.3138,2.7989,0.256,3.1584,1.1381,0.8324,2.6898,1.1659,2.5021,0.3925,1.5398,2.2207,0.8052,4.6378,1.0167,0.3034,0.4962,0.0003,2.9656,1.9577,5.1564,3.194,1.4811,0.7577,3.5335,0.8281,1.9923,1.2826,0.1766,0.8106,1.8833,5.2144,0.019,5.9913,2.5802,0.0396,1.6174,1.7224,0.6387,6.1757,0.0651,1.9125,2.0216,1.8159,4.9475,4.5205,3.5339,5.0725,0.364,0.4456,2.342,1.3886,5.1495,0.4074,0.7581,4.5231,3.5693,3.6864,3.692,2.8458,0.4185,4.5496,2.0858,4.8724,1.1104,2.4687,0.8286,2.9713,2.8047,0.8808,5.6393,2.6479,1.3868,0.1984,2.2732,2.5709,1.6617,0.2304,4.6223,0.4643,0.02,0.0494,0.0089,0.0358,0.9223,0.4847,0.0002,1.8083,4.0905,0.0009,0.0443,0.0345,0.0031,0.0148,0.1625]}

{"id":2320,"ended":false,"length":361,"gen_text":"The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed five of President Donald Trump \u2019 s U.S. Treasury nominees, including the top officials for international affairs and tax policy, easing a shortage of top political appointees in the administration.The nominations were announced after Trump and congressional Democrats met at the White House for a critical vote on the confirmation process.The White House has delayed Trump-era nominees for several months as part of a campaign to keep the government running after his election.Trump had been seeking his first and only term as president. The latest setback on the nomination process came during a Tuesday night debate on MSNBC, where he claimed the new nomination process \"should have been easier with two (Republicans) who were bad at it and I didn't know they had it in Democrat hands.\"Trump's Republican opponents also said they were prepared for a long fight. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he will vote no on any new nominees because they have a history of opposing the Senate's work and won't give up on it, and there is growing public concern about the possibility of a second failed confirmation process during the lame-duck session.Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, on Wednesday said he would push for a second confirmation process instead of waiting for confirmation from Congress when it convenes in mid-September next year.Asked whether he would rule out a second hearing for Trump's nominees, Trump said there were other areas of his executive order that needed more time to go through and that he is looking into further.\"I think that it's got to start with a little more work as they come together. And that's where I'll go to come out with my ideas and my plan when the time comes,\" Trump said in a tweet. \"The time is right. The decision is in. So this is going to happen at my schedule. It will be in very short order.\"","token_len":385,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,4.6566,2.6869,1.5785,3.4361,6.3902,2.2827,3.2004,1.0241,0.0081,18.8543,7.9052,8.9373,6.3647,0.0108,0.0363,0.0173,5.5152,5.9458,2.1719,1.2091,2.8946,3.256,4.5827,4.0728,6.4767,3.1633,1.2124,5.5432,0.6851,1.6151,11.0885,2.2058,6.5946,0.4483,2.9378,5.7365,0.4743,0.0215,2.2582,0.7023,2.7102,0.3545,4.3174,2.6446,1.889,1.3788,2.0757,2.9993,3.6236,3.597,1.565,2.5424,3.3659,0.3411,0.2898,0.0005,2.2764,1.5123,4.8333,2.7065,0.7664,1.367,3.6978,1.7358,0.4645,2.1384,3.7877,0.0014,2.5538,5.426,4.6106,5.1606,2.9541,0.8585,1.1038,2.3876,0.9148,2.8663,3.6426,0.002,1.0735,3.8476,0.6054,3.3317,1.8834,2.2457,3.1048,3.8157,2.4938,1.0624,1.0304,3.0603,3.8964,2.5874,3.0954,5.1006,1.9819,5.4802,0.7051,2.1972,0.8162,0.2118,2.0746,2.1604,5.1274,5.8722,4.8992,1.0883,1.9123,0.9571,1.5834,3.3714,0.813,5.5205,2.7508,3.2691,2.3656,3.069,1.7592,1.171,1.442,4.5878,1.8022,5.3782,4.7242,0.4756,2.901,4.6586,2.4563,0.4474,5.5944,5.2565,5.1261,5.4226,4.2708,0.596,2.742,1.9076,5.5705,1.5976,0.7839,2.1964,4.454,3.0805,0.019,3.3846,2.8284,2.5466,1.7988,2.0881,7.3057,0.9742,0.2954,1.734,2.1347,4.978,1.5901,3.7178,3.0274,2.014,1.634,4.9252,2.6787,1.3308,4.6288,2.4879,2.049,2.5673,0.6585,0.0217,0.0101,0.0001,2.0424,0.1565,0.0091,0.0287,0.0056,4.0772,0.9075,0.933,1.757,2.5916,2.868,0.2513,2.4815,2.7761,0.817,4.4029,2.4206,2.9429,3.3264,1.8293,0.0492,4.9021,1.6222,4.8882,0.5648,3.009,2.8379,5.0673,0.0511,4.2705,0.9736,1.2422,3.1566,3.2971,2.671,5.4934,1.469,3.3059,3.4301,1.7514,0.8654,1.1184,4.4719,0.6297,1.3214,5.5047,5.9533,1.8455,0.6325,4.7105,0.9052,2.3299,0.3832,0.0001,0.0,0.1478,0.9209,2.0627,3.5823,3.4342,2.4584,0.3638,0.3421,1.3299,0.1891,0.1089,4.6435,1.5216,1.5817,0.5515,1.0464,5.1735,0.7156,0.951,1.465,1.6899,0.8277,5.263,0.6269,3.6897,0.7196,3.4651,1.827,2.9515,5.6478,1.7862,4.5951,0.0005,1.1463,2.8971,0.0407,2.5787,5.6533,0.2146,0.3535,5.7956,1.9336,0.5257,0.7104,5.3688,0.2319,1.05,0.2657,3.6696,2.5266,2.3419,1.7653,1.0248,0.7325,1.1189,0.4148,4.8405,2.2496,4.4465,5.4219,1.2887,2.1396,4.5852,2.1918,1.1858,2.2389,3.6101,0.6894,0.7004,4.7897,0.1746,3.0718,1.9312,0.691,3.9467,2.7819,1.9002,4.7813,2.2594,1.0092,1.879,2.6109,2.8312,0.8445,5.3051,0.2128,4.216,1.4004,2.39,5.2646,1.5789,2.5016,5.6359,4.6662,2.5348,3.9275,2.5092,2.6864,2.4856,0.5623,3.1606,1.1564,2.2753,2.6433,2.7349,5.0538,2.7476,1.4611,1.7495,3.9392,1.4516,1.5414,2.8479,5.3699,3.1278,0.3321,0.6179,0.4106,0.7747,0.255,2.3098,1.0867,2.8059,0.5676,3.5083,3.2137,2.6611,0.6993,1.7434,1.3413,2.6192,5.7813,1.4586,3.5657,1.3214,3.744,5.011,0.5233,2.9284,0.0472,2.6213,5.0318,2.4546,4.514,1.2882,3.3344,1.6143,0.6034,3.6238,3.9588,1.7461,0.0316,1.1482]}

It said that on Monday morning, seven Rohingya children were raped with a kite, and that an eight-year-old girl was killed.The report said that while UN agencies were in contact with the women's families, an \"armed group\" began abducting dozens, often forcing them to give up their clothes, food and water. They then slit the throats of their victims, then cut their bodies with cutsticks and sticks.The victims said in separate reports that their husbands or their family members raped them and set a burning fire to destroy their possessions and their homes.\"The family members of these children are the victims of one of the most brutal and shocking attacks committed by international troops,\" the report said.The report said that \"unwanted military incursions\" by Myanmar soldiers had \"enlarged\" the area for at least a year and had disrupted humanitarian aid efforts as thousands had fled.The Rohingya said they now hoped to continue their exodus into Bangladesh and Myanmar. \"You can imagine how it will get worse, and I can only tell you that this will only get worse. It will only get worse, at my own hands, when all their belongings are destroyed in your eyes,\" they said.","token_len":385,"entropy":[8.0543,3.6093,0.0339,4.7015,0.0101,0.5888,10.0683,2.7491,1.975,5.2608,0.0013,1.8376,1.7522,12.7681,5.0907,4.5591,2.8592,0.2384,3.6582,7.1508,2.101,6.1755,2.838,3.9673,1.8992,3.7734,1.2828,1.9704,7.0095,1.0702,5.2645,0.5785,6.3229,0.8704,4.3317,2.3588,4.3761,3.7165,3.0126,1.9361,0.8384,0.7019,0.2012,2.3516,5.289,0.0384,3.8278,0.0015,3.0298,1.7565,1.331,1.1887,3.5105,1.9067,4.6983,4.1322,0.0027,4.5639,2.3039,1.6969,2.9896,0.2249,0.2737,3.155,2.1972,2.4159,5.128,3.3138,2.0418,1.6179,4.3091,6.378,4.2593,0.6109,5.1749,1.1459,0.9575,1.6773,2.5079,5.0006,2.0395,5.5414,2.7748,0.0049,2.2072,1.0091,3.9335,0.9787,3.6496,4.2052,3.6787,0.3708,2.3323,0.0052,0.6627,0.039,6.4454,1.963,4.074,0.6248,3.378,2.0471,3.5014,2.2905,2.9095,2.3752,1.9527,2.0583,0.0066,0.5078,1.9117,0.0065,0.2429,0.0002,2.1746,1.0307,1.2565,3.3539,4.4171,1.1527,3.3984,1.5996,3.3797,0.0035,1.7727,4.5804,4.8022,3.1301,2.6839,1.846,4.1807,0.1214,2.0628,1.5078,0.5598,3.0701,0.7152,5.0945,1.1728,1.7927,0.4453,4.4822,3.1626,1.9603,4.7159,2.7147,3.9462,0.4564,5.3492,1.2295,3.0475,0.8253,1.9238,5.5395,2.11,5.5282,0.9573,2.1599,1.6799,1.4604,4.433,3.8781,0.0365,0.2507,0.0332,0.0008,0.8698,0.5458,2.2775,1.6095,1.7293,1.418,1.5316,0.7297,3.8827,5.2677,4.2057,2.4728,4.0665,2.9285,0.0636,1.2664,4.6984,1.3647,1.1927,0.6817,5.4186,2.4851,2.7551,0.8795,0.5643,5.1306,3.544,0.0068,6.4406,3.8939,4.0093,6.0158,0.6153,0.2211,3.9336,0.681,0.1635,2.7409,1.7376,3.1223,0.503,2.4608,0.7752,3.6791,2.7486,5.765,1.8147,0.3318,0.1316,1.628,0.896,1.3114,3.5026,4.5017,1.0793,3.6121,1.2556,5.7047,5.5364,1.524,3.4887,1.1291,1.8289,3.0252,3.3435,5.3013,4.4438,2.3908,0.2,2.7315,3.325,3.5276,2.848,3.1589,0.0699,2.2017,0.1299,2.209,5.495,5.2766,3.7671,2.7806,2.4339,4.668,0.5251,3.1481,2.4094,3.1315,1.1456,2.4374,1.8627,5.3775,0.8628,1.4317,2.0462,1.7914,2.1263,3.1278,1.9376,0.1743,5.7943,0.7617,0.2157,0.7033,1.744,1.4218,4.9832,2.8887,4.2938,0.7627,5.2454,3.1157,2.7043,0.6949,0.2205,0.1304,0.3265,1.704,1.3204,0.9911,0.4269,2.9071,4.0377,3.206,0.4469,4.6562,3.3931,0.1777,1.2528,1.4614,1.7962,1.7233,3.202,2.9241,5.2997,5.3542,0.0006,2.533,1.1881,1.73,4.4472,4.641,0.0003,3.15,1.442,1.4405,2.8819,5.9476,4.3106,1.4656,1.6386,4.8344,4.656,4.4003,0.5376,2.1633,1.6445,2.5224,3.8366,1.067,6.0102,5.6268,0.8997,3.9406,1.0959,2.6679,2.969,0.1786,1.9175,3.1705,1.2891,3.0529,5.8806,1.8215,3.7007,1.5743,4.1015,1.3001,3.9153,0.0893,2.7258,2.2945,2.6359,3.1412,1.9466,3.3683,0.025,0.843,2.6198,1.6578,3.13,1.2293,0.0235,2.1053,2.3792,0.6752,2.911,0.2222,0.022,2.5027,6.2756,6.1129,2.6623,1.0003,2.02,3.4076,3.2704,5.7331,3.4369,0.7794,1.1563,3.4974,4.9211,4.7533,0.8326,1.5048,0.1281,0.5856]}
{"id":3175,"ended":true,"length":372,"gen_text":"Russia has detained a Norwegian citizen it suspects of spying, the RIA news agency reported on Tuesday, citing a Moscow court which sanctioned the individual s detention. Media reports said Russia s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was in the courtroom to welcome the ruling. The agency cited a spokesman for Putin as saying that he would continue the country's efforts to identify foreign-policy criminals. The Russian government could not be reached for comment on the case after the ruling was announced. In February, Putin and Obama agreed to meet to discuss the situation on the Korean peninsula and to resolve concerns over Iran's nuclear program, foreign ministry spokesman Vitaly Mutko said. The Security Council will review the ruling, which also bars US and South Korean officials from talking about any future talks with North Korea with a view to ending them. If confirmed, Trump has not ruled out any further talks on the issue while in the White House, which makes Washington's reaction possible because of its recent history of hostility to North Korea itself and the perceived'special relationship' between the two countries. The sanctions also prohibit Iran from buying nuclear technology, some of which are reportedly enriched with uranium. In response to the decision, Trump vowed to meet with North Korea's leader on September 30 to share \"strategic information\" and discuss options. Pyongyang reportedly made its first moves at the beginning of its year-long test of its nuclear program last week. Trump has also said he will send North Korea \"nuclear bombs\" during his trip to Asia and urged the US to focus on solving the Korean Peninsula's problems by cutting aid to Pyongyang. The incident is reportedly also aimed at bolstering South Korean leadership, which are skeptical about Kim Jong Un's ability to curb the North's missile program after he has made threats to the US. He has also hinted at his commitment to the US against North Korean military and cyber attack, which could have an influence on how South Korea perceives Pyongyang.","token_len":385,"entropy":[4.8843,6.6121,2.7879,6.2015,2.5675,7.4698,3.9005,0.2934,3.289,3.2521,2.2894,5.8245,1.2323,1.6193,0.0065,0.2831,1.4338,1.8978,1.8542,0.9081,1.5663,7.5258,3.3016,7.1552,7.0467,0.5159,4.9332,12.6117,9.0344,0.4675,9.9884,0.4207,1.2414,4.8112,7.5178,4.8383,1.1727,0.2939,0.0002,2.567,2.8568,1.9911,2.8657,2.4533,5.9724,0.2125,2.9415,0.6196,2.8361,5.2948,2.3733,1.3838,3.0287,0.2795,4.5085,1.4851,0.1274,1.3119,2.8694,2.5604,4.4541,3.106,5.0779,0.1458,2.0059,0.0861,4.8395,3.4035,4.0168,4.6699,4.1598,0.929,2.361,3.1357,1.9546,5.493,0.5736,1.2211,0.856,0.0726,0.0293,1.8033,0.5741,2.078,6.8379,1.4152,1.3686,2.2165,1.1193,0.2227,4.3412,3.6819,0.3541,3.8597,4.0178,4.1374,2.818,0.3764,5.0123,1.8617,0.2048,1.4872,3.0915,3.3158,0.7516,3.3927,0.4431,2.8377,2.2804,4.9149,4.5329,0.5395,4.2659,0.3417,0.1344,0.1303,1.4855,6.3916,0.932,0.3845,4.4974,0.0015,1.1323,0.0286,0.3957,0.9094,1.9388,5.4371,0.0075,3.2866,4.8704,0.3826,3.7715,2.4104,1.1063,4.1351,3.2862,5.232,2.4949,0.7498,0.4626,1.7406,0.0787,4.7213,0.4926,3.9079,3.1222,2.9493,1.4097,0.6184,0.0357,6.6098,2.1875,0.56,0.0645,3.58,4.4249,0.6846,6.1486,3.4801,0.2417,4.4879,2.6804,4.2656,2.9727,0.2242,3.9287,2.9192,1.7646,2.6148,0.6283,0.7453,6.6337,1.5974,2.8025,0.7994,0.0036,1.0609,2.7975,6.1716,5.9406,1.5199,5.8193,4.1886,4.9586,0.9031,2.541,5.9583,3.3652,0.562,3.4336,0.9993,1.196,0.1146,6.2507,3.9076,1.647,5.0867,11.1781,12.7133,0.6309,5.0673,9.8765,3.2766,1.0969,0.8062,0.609,0.2226,2.2059,4.5043,3.7646,3.8884,4.4502,0.1301,3.1554,3.1731,3.4264,1.3311,6.7348,0.3523,0.232,2.5178,5.1738,3.8383,2.8233,0.9973,0.7989,3.7257,3.2032,0.4917,0.5533,2.6429,0.2369,1.1645,4.495,0.3848,4.7722,0.363,1.295,0.4822,1.3068,0.7948,3.1546,4.4985,2.7593,2.5334,6.5935,1.6867,4.2524,0.1112,2.9478,0.8712,1.8125,3.8486,3.8374,2.0723,5.3999,4.9328,5.4338,3.4101,1.2451,4.61,3.4135,0.6109,4.0833,0.0034,4.0338,3.7424,0.6896,0.1167,4.5175,0.7956,2.3175,1.9987,2.369,2.9126,1.335,0.9391,2.738,1.5433,2.4297,2.5046,0.8434,1.7259,4.7938,2.748,0.4653,2.9849,5.4079,2.8605,0.2744,4.0899,0.6117,1.5156,0.1934,0.7108,3.0496,4.286,1.4807,2.4537,0.2016,5.467,0.6017,5.8577,0.5105,2.7018,1.1784,0.9688,0.9996,3.3838,4.3811,4.8341,0.2665,1.5037,0.4572,2.0467,6.1728,3.0225,5.589,5.0613,4.4866,0.0253,3.9151,0.0021,4.307,1.6336,4.3499,1.8357,1.4958,3.7838,5.1914,1.6816,4.7878,0.5468,0.2935,0.2405,1.6583,0.0057,5.0838,1.8799,1.5756,0.2246,2.744,1.058,5.1692,1.7298,4.2675,4.6625,4.1629,1.2787,4.1208,1.7475,1.4051,4.7938,0.9791,1.3979,4.8493,1.3331,2.391,5.5364,0.0416,2.5458,2.2608,3.5184,0.4481,2.4253,4.3169,2.7383,3.3344,4.0995,1.5356,2.2897,2.3626,3.6018,2.9464,4.5338,0.2717,2.6753,2.9905,0.3031,3.631,0.0003,3.4149,0.4826]}

On Tuesday Arab leaders met in Cairo to discuss potential talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank, including the possibility of a future cease-fire, the United States says.Israel said the Arab League agreed the Arab League should recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital without violating its sovereignty and sovereignty over the West Bank and East Jerusalem. It said the UN, the UN secretary general and Jordan also agreed to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital during the resolution negotiations. Israel's government said the Arab League leaders \"refused to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital on September 30, 2002.\"Jordan's ambassador said in a statement that there was no attempt to influence the decision of Arab League lawmakers.It has repeatedly urged the Palestinian leadership on the matter.Jabbar al-Sisi, who is known as the son of former Palestinian president Hafez al-Assad, held the position of prime minister in 2005.He was born in Qaraqosh near the Palestinian border.Egypt, which backs the Palestinian-run Fatah movement, says the Arab League vote comes after years of negotiations and was the result of Egypt's Arab League and U.N. pressure against Israel. Israel and Egypt have maintained a close relationship, dating back to the 1974 Peace Accords.","token_len":386,"entropy":[11.3002,4.8465,0.5721,2.2674,0.3932,1.4735,8.9289,9.0158,6.0981,0.4361,0.9474,4.6044,0.0057,0.2009,0.2108,2.4249,0.8319,4.551,0.4755,0.2124,0.5131,13.1625,1.0927,1.8576,1.3117,6.127,4.6028,3.0905,0.0028,5.3981,9.6374,8.308,6.9805,0.5888,3.5604,0.8095,5.7815,3.8507,4.6802,4.7476,0.8656,0.6331,3.5613,4.3883,1.8406,4.8626,4.0832,2.8991,5.0799,1.4332,5.435,0.7307,4.219,0.48,3.2902,7.287,0.8535,6.2722,0.5364,1.1934,2.9685,2.8246,0.2021,6.1043,1.7603,4.0554,2.0784,1.7572,3.9649,0.0412,2.3994,0.5767,2.7161,5.077,0.0009,1.3039,1.065,1.1357,2.6114,5.5005,3.3529,5.8919,5.5653,5.4128,1.4102,1.6126,4.8363,0.9782,4.4557,0.0003,0.0004,4.8677,4.4146,0.4106,1.4274,1.2226,3.0119,1.1465,2.1634,2.3825,2.0817,1.5834,0.9915,4.0453,0.9098,2.2933,1.1548,2.2151,0.1936,3.2885,1.7356,0.5566,3.6556,2.027,2.2449,2.8324,0.5895,1.6196,4.1757,0.0593,2.4659,2.1077,1.7137,1.9417,0.5882,1.5281,5.4153,0.0935,1.0615,1.8101,5.8307,1.6228,5.4,0.7029,3.0436,0.7377,0.8843,0.6552,0.6927,5.6619,3.5694,2.2941,4.5768,0.0039,0.3782,0.0007,5.0814,4.711,0.53,2.3222,0.3368,0.2323,0.7576,0.001,1.9811,4.5519,1.4737,2.5567,0.0647,1.6019,3.9,5.0751,0.0391,0.0018,2.338,2.2664,3.4439,2.1685,4.8164,0.3474,2.8203,2.7401,1.7536,3.2807,1.7109,4.5751,4.598,2.7159,0.8713,2.3512,2.9195,0.2153,0.4028,0.5794,0.4593,0.0325,4.6741,5.2973,2.3558,2.1275,2.0712,3.0292,1.3063,1.0921,1.5176,0.0016,1.6187,1.2112,0.0012,0.7026,3.4515,1.072,1.2435,5.4188,4.437,1.7072,2.6055,3.0712,1.0191,0.6719,5.1935,4.3387,0.7463,1.0935,0.693,0.3189,0.2953,0.4376,0.0612,0.0315,7.0789,1.2423,5.2086,6.2699,0.8171,4.334,1.8846,3.0232,0.9401,1.3525,1.462,0.0386,5.719,4.6349,4.1678,0.1921,0.1762,1.6125,0.8967,0.2437,0.49,0.1521,0.0478,3.3896,5.0339,3.0712,0.9703,3.9984,1.3238,4.3078,1.2734,3.2521,3.2574,3.0495,0.3421,0.3487,0.7856,4.6724,0.8084,0.8019,5.2931,0.3529,4.2378,0.4477,2.6955,2.1759,2.2377,2.2036,5.3533,2.1581,5.3908,3.7776,3.9527,3.8908,1.034,3.2049,0.7733,4.1466,0.8146,2.8268,2.1582,5.9808,1.4883,3.1494,1.8931,0.0807,4.1546,2.1174,0.2743,2.8573,1.7065,5.1924,0.8641,0.9583,3.8717,0.0344,2.3811,3.8473,1.0793,5.8497,0.0628,0.1192,0.0044,0.061,0.2059,5.8997,2.0006,3.2723,0.6924,2.8188,0.0393,1.8796,4.1166,1.5864,3.4701,1.6696,4.8222,0.1793,5.4815,3.0207,0.2843,0.0031,4.4341,0.9132,3.6694,1.8853,1.9203,5.7797,2.6538,1.0342,4.0843,0.8063,1.5278,5.1204,4.001,3.3233,0.0004,1.6634,0.3725,3.6794,1.9578,2.3331,0.1363,3.6624,5.605,1.6479,2.9192,0.0139,3.0622,2.3265,4.3151,3.7025,2.7142,0.0016,5.2011,0.4279,5.097,0.8473,3.9922,2.9834,0.0022,0.3064,0.3231,5.66,2.6957,1.235,0.5656,4.3697,3.1211,0.9672,0.9926,3.8038,1.4747,2.5868,0.9639,2.4125,5.1947,0.175,0.3574,0.7646,5.7979,4.225,0.32,0.0004,1.0104]}

The committee said on Friday it will vote on the Senate's nominee by the end of the day\n\nPowell is widely regarded as the country's top economic advisor and has provided extensive details to the public about his role as the director of policy development for the Fed during his three decades at the helm. During his four decade at the helm, Powell directed the Fed's $200 billion monetary policy strategy. Powell's tenure at the Fed was the longest since the world's financial crisis of 2008-09, with more than 200 Fed members joining him on nine previous Fed Board appointments since 2010.\n\nHe stepped down from his post in August for reasons including conflicts of interest.\n\nThe Federal Reserve recently announced another report that warned about the risks of financial markets, including losses, for the next five years from a near and long run, which could negatively impact investment and demand in the financial services sector.\n\nPowell made some of the key decisions during those seven years. He issued a $1 trillion bond and sold it on for roughly $15 billion. He gave the country's largest publicly traded banks $100 billion to sell bonds backed by the new credit rating agencies. His approval ratings of banks also increased sharply from 2008, when he had little influence.\n\nAfter his death, Powell was the first U.S. political leader to publicly oppose President Barack Obama's executive actions in response to a law that gave businesses and organizations the authority to refuse service to Americans without express written consent.\n\nHis resignation followed a five-year investigation that concluded that he misled consumers about the risks of using private company bonds.

What I would like to see is a global effort that would make the very world that we are in, and I'd encourage that effort right now on our transition to a stronger, more prosperous future.\"\n\nTrump is scheduled to address the U.N., Sept. 23-28.","token_len":392,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,7.3302,1.4959,3.7899,0.9246,1.2728,13.8491,3.1035,1.0257,5.6431,0.1769,4.6193,3.3625,1.1104,2.9464,6.7502,2.5652,2.5307,6.1291,0.0009,0.3849,0.0065,1.0316,2.2126,2.513,2.7848,17.4184,7.9631,13.2046,7.0631,3.026,4.6641,6.6028,5.8928,3.2136,1.2414,2.1373,3.0714,2.2734,3.007,3.3377,0.9191,1.6751,4.1644,0.6286,0.7059,1.5256,0.1182,0.8431,3.3585,0.1492,0.9524,2.3969,0.3199,1.0909,1.8254,3.1268,4.9031,5.1165,2.0615,4.5481,3.998,1.8535,1.502,0.5675,0.364,0.0002,3.4474,0.0218,0.0001,1.5045,2.5192,2.2446,4.3529,1.5283,2.5797,4.2422,0.3077,1.3186,0.5636,5.8809,1.7512,4.6146,4.8568,0.0018,0.1219,0.018,5.0488,0.1146,1.8125,1.4752,5.6544,1.3512,0.157,2.3413,0.0169,1.4744,3.3227,3.7405,2.4483,1.5272,1.3159,1.8949,2.4617,0.4311,2.122,1.9168,4.4652,3.2142,5.6537,3.9186,3.9051,4.9355,0.9597,0.0067,3.8285,0.8836,4.7351,1.1983,0.7935,0.3232,1.7859,4.2927,1.0175,2.8663,1.9588,2.9938,6.5978,0.4751,3.3873,0.4842,0.159,1.242,0.0914,0.0002,4.1605,2.0821,0.3545,0.5177,2.7394,2.182,1.3983,5.904,0.9681,1.5784,5.952,2.5978,4.0812,0.639,1.3418,2.133,3.1446,3.9706,4.807,1.8408,3.888,3.6448,0.3723,4.6823,0.1116,3.4061,5.5919,5.4688,0.5665,1.0089,0.2218,0.0002,0.8353,5.8682,0.5837,0.0391,1.9869,1.8301,0.0113,3.39,2.0138,2.1645,3.3688,2.9198,2.4593,0.1825,0.0228,1.6518,1.1995,4.2709,2.7277,1.3928,4.3003,5.5007,1.8854,1.1548,2.2346,4.7575,4.0576,0.3434,5.1219,1.7106,0.6927,3.8729,0.3584,0.148,5.1363,6.5413,0.7999,3.0127,5.2438,3.3132,1.5044,0.7313,0.5316,1.2907,2.9522,0.3771,4.7488,5.3655,2.887,1.193,0.7879,0.5488,0.1526,0.2334,0.406,0.0002,1.2816,1.1119,3.2969,1.9686,1.3197,4.384,2.972,2.1538,6.1423,0.0585,0.6552,0.6001,0.6694,1.1344,2.6491,3.1569,6.2284,4.8675,1.0715,5.0162,2.2154,4.9154,1.4463,2.334,0.0064,0.6751,1.3932,1.2963,1.9909,3.7177,1.0734,3.0016,0.6317,2.1487,3.033,1.8239,7.4129,0.9402,1.6635,2.6176,3.6572,3.0588,4.2965,0.6979,0.8646,0.4938,1.8579,1.2872,3.5987,1.6888,1.0077,2.3938,0.2816,1.673,6.399,1.1662,1.4824,0.2757,0.1773,5.3726,3.2824,1.5598,3.7948,3.6431,0.0008,1.8941,2.3809,6.7497,0.6317,1.033,0.0069,0.1827,3.6814,4.9563,0.1368,2.9756,0.9465,6.0976,4.6831,1.7575,0.1015,2.2293,0.3664,2.3535,0.4795,3.9732,1.8945,1.113,1.2563,4.2364,1.8726,0.1568,4.3003,1.2145,2.4796,0.0006,1.0743,2.883,1.0929,1.5202,1.2195,1.3632,0.8845,3.7399,1.9008,6.0183,0.8985,3.134,1.9679,0.1834,0.363,0.6276,1.0653,3.7752,0.3169,1.3933,2.6328,3.1698,1.9742,6.4652,4.2538,1.3596,0.4028,2.9247,2.1168,2.0395,2.2401,2.6993,2.6472,5.4535,2.4001,1.5354,6.4606,0.2311,5.1672,4.5149,5.7394,0.9023,0.6435,3.7313,0.8996,0.4985,1.2167,3.21,1.1242,0.1461,0.0002,0.9318,3.6434,2.1564,0.0366,2.9627,0.6081,2.0941,0.0006,0.0654,4.1277,5.7577,0.0091,3.4611,0.8869,3.084,0.9775]}

The ban was set to expire at the start of next year.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese media reports say the Chinese government and business leaders have repeatedly tried to work together to combat the rise of North Korean refugees, even at the suggestion that American forces fighting the North might even help the regime to escape.\n\nIn April, President Trump has hinted that he would bring in some \"special forces\" during the tour, but only after Congress has passed sanctions on North Korea, which U.S. authorities accuse of being a rogue nation that has turned a blind eye to the crisis.","token_len":394,"entropy":[10.0389,2.6601,4.6682,4.5878,6.7532,4.5885,2.7339,10.9931,7.9908,3.1111,0.7113,3.459,0.3294,0.0005,1.2712,8.6699,5.3051,1.9824,2.0685,5.6441,2.6517,5.0918,9.3316,1.6994,0.0002,4.5086,1.3766,5.4,6.2448,5.549,0.0153,6.6456,0.0411,0.4159,0.1443,0.2974,0.211,0.0043,8.629,1.3066,1.9643,0.5071,5.4038,0.0035,0.1082,0.2348,2.7754,3.3613,3.1826,0.314,0.1392,0.6572,0.0004,4.3206,1.3711,2.7901,1.243,2.4791,0.5904,5.0457,2.5108,0.0294,3.1246,4.811,1.8835,0.8769,0.3476,2.589,1.6988,0.263,4.9562,2.0351,0.2866,1.5541,3.9486,5.784,5.2076,1.4714,5.4521,2.533,0.2627,3.3693,0.9013,2.7776,3.8802,1.0936,0.7378,0.0002,3.3439,2.5828,2.034,0.7804,0.0173,1.2157,0.3116,2.4101,0.0,2.6247,6.0042,3.6359,3.2357,2.4531,1.7741,1.2158,3.3663,5.1463,5.4667,1.6396,5.2289,0.3267,4.8956,4.4104,5.1466,3.3028,0.8788,0.8392,2.3366,2.0913,2.9181,2.8062,1.0902,0.7728,0.3022,0.0002,5.0643,0.9434,0.971,0.0038,0.0693,1.9027,2.7604,0.5414,1.1581,1.9381,3.9315,0.0652,4.0545,0.005,0.0706,1.9309,5.5264,3.2591,5.9262,1.7408,2.7952,3.3495,0.6849,2.8378,4.564,2.0178,5.2696,0.0109,3.8706,5.1739,0.265,3.7819,1.1712,3.7718,4.6164,1.4773,4.0774,3.544,0.9285,2.9182,5.1819,0.001,4.9708,0.3999,3.0382,2.5497,1.4392,0.2827,0.0002,5.1622,0.0399,5.1072,0.338,4.3167,1.4711,0.0058,6.4984,4.885,2.2579,5.2841,0.3528,5.1311,0.436,1.8832,4.932,2.3126,1.8203,4.701,0.5876,1.3396,1.4038,0.0552,5.5184,0.8489,4.051,1.1669,1.3432,0.0021,2.6805,1.6841,0.072,2.6576,0.3359,0.4316,0.3693,0.0002,2.041,5.2096,0.5123,1.3076,3.6278,0.2645,0.5475,0.0465,2.4481,2.2527,3.655,2.7799,4.6305,0.9358,0.0473,3.9333,5.6996,0.8307,1.4737,6.0008,2.9754,0.1512,0.1278,2.7921,2.6566,3.8879,4.0588,1.3721,1.6761,2.4152,3.5351,4.6993,4.6713,1.376,2.9129,3.6161,0.005,3.4784,4.1158,4.9711,1.9532,1.2429,6.1502,2.5011,0.6848,0.3446,0.4027,0.0003,1.7393,2.1359,6.5052,3.1969,5.1951,0.0295,0.3658,1.4749,6.0692,0.6309,5.4886,1.7005,4.0716,6.4764,1.2923,2.5868,0.0226,5.6641,3.1169,2.2334,1.4247,1.2865,5.5373,0.3102,0.8684,2.1023,0.0955,5.3649,0.0014,1.4269,0.2158,0.6981,0.5374,0.0003,4.9427,0.0289,3.1945,3.8152,2.1444,2.1577,2.0512,2.2319,0.4475,4.5018,5.3681,1.1412,1.4729,5.6188,3.9927,0.0296,4.9482,1.657,0.4732,3.96,0.7454,3.7236,0.2982,2.5532,1.223,1.8168,1.8282,4.5904,5.4722,0.4786,5.4411,2.0987,6.0933,5.0776,5.1805,0.8028,0.8807,1.6497,5.6102,3.4994,2.0844,3.1381,4.0701,3.2876,0.8705,0.367,0.0003,2.7994,3.0702,0.1559,2.9983,0.8752,4.8444,5.6415,0.6324,0.7736,1.8028,5.0087,1.7446,3.438,3.5783,4.0314,0.9131,0.3472,5.7541,2.0412,5.4061,1.362,1.8753,4.6057,1.6272,5.1561,2.7412,1.5272,5.5945,1.2962,0.6281,0.0488,2.3051,1.4649,4.8082,0.0004,0.0113,0.0016,4.8219,2.8068,0.3846,3.6087,1.211,2.0974,2.5984,2.5187,1.309,5.5989,0.8943,0.1095,0.0005,0.0494,2.0112,4.786,0.4179]}
{"id":3491,"ended":true,"length":372,"gen_text":"When soldiers burst into her village in southwest Cameroon last month with guns blazing, small farmer Eta Quinta, 32, raced into the forest with three of her children. I found a dozen or three dead in the middle of the night and on the spot.\n\nThe woman is now under attack by the Nourjouwet tribe, armed to the teeth, she said. When the police came on the scene, they found three girls, mostly 5-year-olds. The children had been shot in the head and arms, she said.\n\n\"I was sitting there crying and thinking that this is the beginning of something,\" she said, adding that one of the girls had died.\n\nIt's a horrifying way to die. If a woman is the prime example of an organized crime or a criminal group with long histories, then the authorities need to do away with it. One of Eta's three children, who died, had fled from what she and her siblings described as an army, she said. \"We are living the life of a martyr, so I'm afraid for all of us,\" she said, explaining she feared losing her father and mother to protect her from those who seek to kill her. \"We have a lot to give.\"\n\nSome of the children who were shot might even die. When the young Cameroonians returned home from school, the soldiers had surrounded their house and brought back their children, she said. The army and government had also moved in, she said.\n\n\"We must start to put a stop to it. As long as you stop trying to help, this will cease.

Dear Mr. President, you should consider yourself in your proper place of power.\"\n\nFollow @politico","token_len":394,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,7.2578,1.8145,0.1634,0.0112,0.0007,2.0128,2.6898,2.0465,3.4697,9.0525,1.903,1.224,5.6599,1.9511,8.1643,0.8451,2.9892,8.8764,0.5991,4.3469,7.397,0.8038,0.1551,4.2259,0.7268,0.0101,0.0045,13.5331,7.1442,9.8203,9.0787,0.0134,3.6962,2.7234,1.1662,3.2658,2.6388,0.7033,2.244,0.6985,1.4701,3.3019,5.3085,1.572,2.5249,2.4343,6.7556,0.1994,0.3525,0.0002,3.3467,1.3259,2.0832,0.6634,2.2937,5.59,0.4831,1.034,1.5082,2.0561,0.3269,2.5326,1.0968,3.3384,3.522,2.0481,1.2476,5.0267,3.8416,0.0565,1.9377,0.1809,0.2427,2.6405,3.7292,2.4569,0.6997,0.1118,2.9878,0.0085,4.3701,3.5482,0.1572,2.3754,0.4383,5.0524,2.2033,4.3525,3.4762,1.1045,0.342,0.0002,1.869,2.9802,3.3946,2.9644,0.0122,2.8274,1.4829,3.6047,1.2633,4.832,3.5346,0.7532,2.6996,2.6636,4.0396,0.0097,1.3401,0.8881,1.8654,0.5661,4.8042,1.3703,3.8284,5.054,0.8502,0.5634,0.4331,0.0002,2.255,3.3412,3.8053,2.0694,1.6942,3.444,4.9183,4.2846,0.1296,0.4389,2.5538,3.2637,1.8044,6.262,1.4059,1.0071,2.2372,2.6985,1.3341,2.5626,7.8855,1.2584,5.5809,5.3345,2.7738,4.7506,2.2499,0.3852,1.3516,4.2206,2.7651,0.8008,1.777,0.5719,3.0202,2.7999,1.6001,0.1998,1.6492,3.4407,1.5873,0.3194,5.1406,1.0057,0.0113,0.0029,0.0003,0.0285,2.7853,3.9171,0.4059,0.5492,0.0526,2.3286,0.7697,0.2482,0.0002,2.3139,2.0774,2.3891,0.4901,4.7274,0.0257,4.6436,6.9378,0.8404,5.677,2.5775,2.2476,1.6601,2.3787,4.6032,1.4622,4.8017,2.0954,0.357,0.2765,3.7948,1.2274,1.2534,1.7414,0.0484,4.8501,2.4516,3.287,4.1116,5.7255,4.1478,0.0179,2.2269,2.0199,6.3424,1.8301,3.3112,0.7859,2.281,3.4892,5.2901,5.5139,2.8402,1.4602,4.4194,4.4661,2.3056,1.7958,3.5499,2.5987,3.5196,0.0854,0.3564,0.2648,0.0002,5.1737,3.539,0.0309,0.2006,0.0467,1.2594,0.3886,2.985,2.2627,4.2039,3.9977,4.7684,1.1657,2.1733,2.23,1.5574,0.019,1.5561,3.6211,1.0606,1.0913,2.5548,0.7935,6.2482,3.9995,3.1423,1.1427,2.4194,1.7852,2.9481,1.0402,4.1285,1.1456,1.1118,4.7986,0.6893,4.1514,4.0288,2.2156,2.4892,3.0777,4.3537,1.9353,4.4626,1.0306,0.9929,1.8503,0.0942,1.9464,1.1625,0.1925,4.4211,0.1429,5.2125,1.2813,0.4254,0.0002,5.5185,0.0246,3.017,4.054,3.5413,3.0958,3.6173,0.0198,2.4097,1.1498,4.985,4.0459,0.4832,0.4936,0.0001,4.2922,5.3861,2.7413,1.6502,1.301,2.7661,3.8392,0.0207,0.0641,2.5355,1.2096,5.2914,0.8731,3.0487,2.3739,0.4769,5.78,3.2392,0.5002,3.4653,5.3478,5.6811,0.0567,2.4539,5.2466,0.1905,5.534,3.3456,3.3029,1.278,1.2126,1.6304,0.0068,4.1196,0.894,1.9977,3.2199,2.5762,0.3369,6.7687,4.1057,2.9055,5.6362,3.803,5.014,2.6941,0.0684,1.001,0.81,1.8092,4.7425,1.6087,1.2498,2.2896,5.0094,1.1106,2.0665,5.0294,0.8096,2.1715,2.5622,1.6678,2.708,2.0244,5.7313,1.2822,0.0014,0.0095,0.1763,2.363,2.1408,4.3709,3.3883,4.1032,3.5408,4.9729,0.6232,3.377,3.1239,1.4811,0.2081,0.0003,5.4012,3.3738,0.3944,0.0078]}

The Chinese government recently started a five-week suspension of tourism to Vietnam last week following allegations of a number of allegations of sexual assault.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 80,000 government personnel and military personnel live in China but have been told to leave the country during the trip, according to state-run China Daily.\n\nThe China Daily reported earlier this month that China had stopped the importation of the second-hand tarpaulin, the main ingredient in the Chinese cooking of vegetables and other delicacies in a deal struck with officials last year.\n\nThe Chinese banned imports earlier this year after South Korea asked for help through the country's WTO. The ban was set to expire at the start of next year.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese media reports say the Chinese government and business leaders have repeatedly tried to work together to combat the rise of North Korean refugees, even at the suggestion that American forces fighting the North might even help the regime to escape.\n\nIn April, President Trump has hinted that he would bring in some \"special forces\" during the tour, but only after Congress has passed sanctions on North Korea, which U.S. authorities accuse of being a rogue nation that has turned a blind eye to the crisis.","token_len":394,"entropy":[10.0389,2.6601,4.6682,4.5878,6.7532,4.5885,2.7339,10.9931,7.9908,3.1111,0.7113,3.459,0.3294,0.0005,1.2712,8.6699,5.3051,1.9824,2.0685,5.6441,2.6517,5.0918,9.3316,1.6994,0.0002,4.5086,1.3766,5.4,6.2448,5.549,0.0153,6.6456,0.0411,0.4159,0.1443,0.2974,0.211,0.0043,8.629,1.3066,1.9643,0.5071,5.4038,0.0035,0.1082,0.2348,2.7754,3.3613,3.1826,0.314,0.1392,0.6572,0.0004,4.3206,1.3711,2.7901,1.243,2.4791,0.5904,5.0457,2.5108,0.0294,3.1246,4.811,1.8835,0.8769,0.3476,2.589,1.6988,0.263,4.9562,2.0351,0.2866,1.5541,3.9486,5.784,5.2076,1.4714,5.4521,2.533,0.2627,3.3693,0.9013,2.7776,3.8802,1.0936,0.7378,0.0002,3.3439,2.5828,2.034,0.7804,0.0173,1.2157,0.3116,2.4101,0.0,2.6247,6.0042,3.6359,3.2357,2.4531,1.7741,1.2158,3.3663,5.1463,5.4667,1.6396,5.2289,0.3267,4.8956,4.4104,5.1466,3.3028,0.8788,0.8392,2.3366,2.0913,2.9181,2.8062,1.0902,0.7728,0.3022,0.0002,5.0643,0.9434,0.971,0.0038,0.0693,1.9027,2.7604,0.5414,1.1581,1.9381,3.9315,0.0652,4.0545,0.005,0.0706,1.9309,5.5264,3.2591,5.9262,1.7408,2.7952,3.3495,0.6849,2.8378,4.564,2.0178,5.2696,0.0109,3.8706,5.1739,0.265,3.7819,1.1712,3.7718,4.6164,1.4773,4.0774,3.544,0.9285,2.9182,5.1819,0.001,4.9708,0.3999,3.0382,2.5497,1.4392,0.2827,0.0002,5.1622,0.0399,5.1072,0.338,4.3167,1.4711,0.0058,6.4984,4.885,2.2579,5.2841,0.3528,5.1311,0.436,1.8832,4.932,2.3126,1.8203,4.701,0.5876,1.3396,1.4038,0.0552,5.5184,0.8489,4.051,1.1669,1.3432,0.0021,2.6805,1.6841,0.072,2.6576,0.3359,0.4316,0.3693,0.0002,2.041,5.2096,0.5123,1.3076,3.6278,0.2645,0.5475,0.0465,2.4481,2.2527,3.655,2.7799,4.6305,0.9358,0.0473,3.9333,5.6996,0.8307,1.4737,6.0008,2.9754,0.1512,0.1278,2.7921,2.6566,3.8879,4.0588,1.3721,1.6761,2.4152,3.5351,4.6993,4.6713,1.376,2.9129,3.6161,0.005,3.4784,4.1158,4.9711,1.9532,1.2429,6.1502,2.5011,0.6848,0.3446,0.4027,0.0003,1.7393,2.1359,6.5052,3.1969,5.1951,0.0295,0.3658,1.4749,6.0692,0.6309,5.4886,1.7005,4.0716,6.4764,1.2923,2.5868,0.0226,5.6641,3.1169,2.2334,1.4247,1.2865,5.5373,0.3102,0.8684,2.1023,0.0955,5.3649,0.0014,1.4269,0.2158,0.6981,0.5374,0.0003,4.9427,0.0289,3.1945,3.8152,2.1444,2.1577,2.0512,2.2319,0.4475,4.5018,5.3681,1.1412,1.4729,5.6188,3.9927,0.0296,4.9482,1.657,0.4732,3.96,0.7454,3.7236,0.2982,2.5532,1.223,1.8168,1.8282,4.5904,5.4722,0.4786,5.4411,2.0987,6.0933,5.0776,5.1805,0.8028,0.8807,1.6497,5.6102,3.4994,2.0844,3.1381,4.0701,3.2876,0.8705,0.367,0.0003,2.7994,3.0702,0.1559,2.9983,0.8752,4.8444,5.6415,0.6324,0.7736,1.8028,5.0087,1.7446,3.438,3.5783,4.0314,0.9131,0.3472,5.7541,2.0412,5.4061,1.362,1.8753,4.6057,1.6272,5.1561,2.7412,1.5272,5.5945,1.2962,0.6281,0.0488,2.3051,1.4649,4.8082,0.0004,0.0113,0.0016,4.8219,2.8068,0.3846,3.6087,1.211,2.0974,2.5984,2.5187,1.309,5.5989,0.8943,0.1095,0.0005,0.0494,2.0112,4.786,0.4179]}

He said five of those injured were on the car's front seat waiting for a taxi.\n\nHe said the four victims were travelling together.

''Then the driver crashed into the cyclist, who was running into the road with little injuries.''\n\nAustralian police said in the incident, one pedestrian was run down by a vehicle, and another man in a dark shirt was hit.\n\nAustralian media quoted police sources as saying the driver of the van, 24-year-old Daniel D. Anderman from Sydney, had just arrived at the scene.\n\n''The van was just trying to get into a back parking area to give the crowd some space,'' Australian police spokesman Captain Ian Prior said.\n\nThe passenger is believed to be a 31-year-old driver, police said.\n\n''He's got the same licence plates as two of the victims. The incident is under investigation and we don't know where he gets it from.''\n\nPolice and emergency vehicles were involved Wednesday night in Australia's capital, including Australia Day celebrations in Melbourne.\n\nAn Australian ambulance was called in for treatment of a pedestrian at the scene, which has been in the news since the driver of a car that killed a cyclist in Melbourne took police to nearby South Perth Hospital.","token_len":395,"entropy":[8.4406,2.8174,6.638,3.1655,0.796,3.469,2.2202,1.9585,8.2812,1.8056,0.2148,1.2532,1.3883,2.4029,1.6335,2.8691,6.7524,0.0008,5.0839,0.2329,1.0772,5.8921,2.1896,3.8506,1.4714,0.4772,1.9504,2.6921,1.2835,0.2141,0.0825,9.2286,5.5416,10.4012,0.0248,4.3398,1.0326,1.4229,2.2325,3.272,2.1576,2.3427,1.7954,1.1957,2.6298,8.2913,1.3832,0.0008,4.34,1.941,0.0001,1.9884,6.4564,3.6877,0.0172,3.2881,2.6023,0.4542,1.1889,3.8533,0.9519,2.6277,6.9898,1.8545,2.0521,0.0536,0.0001,4.5631,3.9892,1.8536,1.2283,3.0121,1.7692,1.5598,2.046,3.6681,4.9448,5.6193,2.3443,0.4575,3.5346,0.5441,3.4704,2.7684,1.851,1.3968,5.9703,0.0031,3.8685,4.6309,7.1657,1.3214,2.8149,1.4758,2.9427,5.37,0.3261,4.1577,1.6812,0.8625,2.718,0.3432,4.0025,1.5071,4.9645,0.8077,2.2128,1.2289,8.2872,0.5731,1.4979,2.7808,0.9618,0.2133,0.0002,3.288,0.2443,1.6501,4.8518,2.9354,0.4783,4.195,4.2783,1.9072,3.5834,4.573,2.8554,0.1762,2.8083,4.6565,0.9009,0.907,0.2322,5.2025,0.0197,0.0016,0.0105,0.0009,5.4354,4.9258,5.3532,1.37,0.3424,0.0002,5.6524,3.1025,1.0049,2.6412,5.9376,1.972,5.3405,1.8046,2.5924,4.0571,1.88,1.3527,2.1335,0.5544,4.1797,5.5009,2.8521,0.9794,1.1355,0.0655,0.0626,0.5839,5.5668,1.8264,1.3653,5.2535,0.8094,1.0475,5.1828,1.7894,2.0395,0.5643,3.7259,3.8191,0.3655,0.8106,3.7022,6.2597,3.187,0.7635,0.0214,0.0002,4.4301,2.3929,1.9851,3.5254,3.6152,3.4156,1.4394,2.9367,3.1316,0.4967,5.9263,3.1704,1.2767,0.9384,2.2168,2.5615,2.0836,1.4273,4.1482,4.4497,0.937,3.5086,3.8986,1.0821,1.6118,2.1481,0.4583,0.0003,4.0522,3.3724,4.4015,1.5061,3.0664,0.329,0.0562,1.2574,1.7412,0.4821,0.0661,3.7314,2.145,5.0295,0.0785,0.0015,0.0058,0.0007,4.1585,4.844,4.6494,6.1682,4.4274,4.0512,5.6039,2.6013,0.1217,2.3706,3.9002,3.7544,0.8629,0.877,0.6951,1.1631,0.3086,0.0003,1.9309,1.7228,2.6245,0.9639,5.0796,3.9137,0.0182,1.0346,2.4287,1.9401,5.0313,2.6057,2.1395,3.9834,4.3128,1.9123,5.7734,1.915,1.3542,0.4838,3.4316,1.0557,0.904,3.7052,4.1889,4.2092,0.3837,0.223,0.4227,0.0003,2.5292,5.8467,5.0905,2.3695,0.0036,0.5738,1.6819,4.3474,0.011,0.003,0.0069,0.0004,5.5402,1.5741,1.9474,0.2457,0.1069,0.3542,0.0002,2.1723,2.3608,2.007,4.3616,3.9383,2.5382,5.2692,3.6644,0.4919,6.2142,1.0972,0.2284,1.1018,2.5209,2.308,5.6205,0.744,0.883,0.0415,2.2559,1.4214,3.0961,0.0005,0.7489,3.4693,1.0258,6.6106,2.8467,0.6905,1.5136,0.0724,0.0002,2.0368,4.4564,3.0984,4.6716,1.3216,3.2848,7.2351,0.9187,0.9928,5.6333,0.2289,2.4562,1.0381,5.7786,5.0904,3.3203,0.6886,1.3099,1.0015,1.5049,0.1564,0.0003,4.6967,2.145,5.2825,1.7165,1.4987,3.5687,2.6077,3.3236,0.6811,0.9592,3.8795,3.3022,1.3361,1.1752,1.5631,2.6199,3.1333,1.0029,4.9809,0.9433,1.6272,1.7275,1.8557,4.0287,0.976,1.0228,1.8185,2.8481,3.4116,1.6321,1.4225,1.5149,1.8195,5.417,6.6548,1.397,3.4733,5.3673,3.7552,3.0412,0.6612]}

At the same time, the international community and Israel have maintained that Jerusalem is part of the Judea and Samaria region.\n\nIn the statement, American forces provided details that said the United States would continue to \"fight to the end\" in defense of the city, using the name, \"Jerusalem by the Sea\" and \"the Intolerance for Separation of Church and State at U.S. Embassy in Israel.\"\n\n(Reporting by Lisa Shumaker; Editing by James Dalgleish)","token_len":395,"entropy":[7.9873,4.5259,2.7013,3.4714,5.3701,0.0175,0.0754,0.1632,1.0583,0.1493,0.0052,11.414,9.3887,0.1595,1.0159,0.0321,0.2604,0.0397,0.0403,0.1621,1.2653,1.9033,0.7724,1.5569,2.1517,0.2109,6.7346,2.871,2.8369,7.9372,0.0004,0.4205,0.6579,0.1228,0.0788,2.3199,0.333,0.1958,0.0003,1.4205,3.1387,0.315,4.8822,1.1463,1.7341,0.0742,0.5143,0.8961,0.4379,0.0124,0.5739,0.4099,0.3338,0.1581,0.1777,0.1285,0.0192,0.9413,1.0758,5.4214,1.3751,0.916,0.4352,0.0182,3.2937,0.1443,1.5761,0.0415,3.1568,3.9714,0.0702,3.007,0.8632,2.2732,2.792,4.3762,0.4559,1.6307,0.0357,0.5494,1.2682,0.0219,0.3222,2.0975,1.3274,1.7301,0.1796,0.3164,0.0002,1.9057,4.037,0.0009,1.493,4.8372,4.3979,0.254,4.5444,2.0108,1.7526,2.1866,2.1184,5.662,0.1765,1.1954,3.833,0.0007,0.6236,2.4211,3.1235,1.9512,4.7093,1.47,1.0012,1.763,1.328,3.4739,2.1029,0.0733,0.5725,0.1695,0.0001,3.0112,0.0009,0.0143,3.3117,1.2219,2.5877,3.6791,2.2655,4.5241,5.5152,4.5374,0.655,1.9765,0.3857,2.7681,3.3653,2.7127,2.4196,5.0422,2.2531,3.5562,3.0093,3.2893,0.0873,3.8345,0.9342,3.4179,2.09,4.7499,2.7588,4.8775,2.2281,4.3729,3.5567,1.6811,4.0442,1.4189,0.1702,0.4298,0.2564,0.0002,4.392,2.8832,3.2355,0.0129,3.5403,3.6292,4.0993,1.1744,3.3147,0.6308,0.0036,1.4888,1.3557,3.5393,0.0019,0.0881,0.208,0.1459,0.0263,0.4643,2.5204,0.1249,0.0002,3.0486,2.2889,0.5197,0.6156,1.1563,3.7073,1.2115,0.7523,0.8092,0.859,4.2182,1.3968,6.5485,0.9753,1.3793,1.8891,3.0958,0.5734,2.6325,5.3118,1.9303,2.2775,3.2944,2.7066,0.4071,2.8772,0.6081,6.3941,0.8871,2.2,0.1295,0.1454,1.9809,0.2785,0.0003,6.2434,0.7891,0.5338,0.8321,0.0007,2.1753,0.3116,7.1229,2.5032,3.5971,2.9625,0.0064,4.4037,1.3871,1.3729,0.7804,2.6575,4.7939,3.9792,0.2543,0.7582,0.5646,5.7479,0.0013,3.5653,2.2532,6.2078,4.8501,0.0433,2.1387,2.5489,0.5077,0.0057,0.2122,4.6337,0.0242,0.4556,0.2192,0.0003,3.1593,1.6145,4.1065,0.2743,2.761,3.0235,0.2066,0.7822,1.1037,8.6691,1.3267,4.8796,0.8508,0.7519,3.6124,6.0789,2.2123,4.2265,0.0051,1.2791,1.4199,0.9687,2.1282,1.5462,4.6375,0.7376,4.637,0.7302,2.8664,1.8153,6.1614,0.4495,0.93,0.0045,0.1216,1.3746,5.5292,0.0378,3.6519,2.7382,0.695,4.2924,0.8724,1.6295,0.6882,1.4746,0.0018,0.7371,4.8887,1.2982,0.0323,0.0016,0.0001,1.6284,1.6835,0.296,0.0003,3.1158,2.7563,1.8632,0.3804,5.6718,4.7654,5.1224,4.6856,5.0221,4.729,1.4194,2.2817,0.0111,1.6243,3.3986,0.2522,2.9159,4.5346,2.1678,1.4647,1.1838,0.8099,2.283,4.925,0.0348,1.1724,1.4578,1.7178,5.8498,2.2248,3.9637,4.8347,0.9013,0.4979,0.0008,6.3284,1.1969,1.1974,2.1355,1.7305,1.3533,2.1897,5.6498,8.0851,1.093,3.1236,0.007,0.4036,0.6175,0.0052,0.0017,5.1911,4.6421,0.0073,1.025,0.2857,3.7604,0.4935,2.2376,0.7922,0.2209,0.0002,5.9618,0.5506,0.0733,5.0009,0.7394,0.2366,0.0334,0.4077,0.1456,0.0016,4.4954,0.035,0.0433,0.0248,0.0003,0.3791]}

{"id":2683,"ended":true,"length":382,"gen_text":"Mexico has this year registered its highest murder total since modern records began, according to official data, dealing a fresh blow to President Enrique Pena Nieto s pledge to get gang violence under control after three decades in which drug cartels killed more people than any other country in Mexico alone -- in 2001 and 2003. More than 5,400 people has been murdered in the first six months of this year, according to new data from the National Institute on Drugs and Crime [NIMC] and the National Institute for Drug Control and Prevention (Ninpac). The National Institute for Drug Control and Prevention has estimated that the total number of deaths has climbed by 936 since 2001, with more than 3.3 million persons killed in the country for each year since 2007. In a separate country the number of deaths fell for one year after last year's earthquake, the first ever quake in a southern Mexico city, which left nearly 613 people dead. In recent years, authorities have struggled to contain the flow of heroin from Peru and are struggling to control the drug trade and arrest drug dealers who exploit the high price of the powder, which has recently become more lethal in Mexico. In 2015, authorities began to cut out from the drug trafficking networks a number of gang members who are believed to pose a significant risk to law enforcement, where the drugs have been heavily used in gang members' lives for decades. In 2016, a court ordered the government to pay nearly $750 million to the gangs that owned and ran the Mexican state-run national police cartel.\n\n\nMexico City officials do not have that luxury as they face growing calls from lawmakers and state security authorities to curb the flow of narcotics and human trafficking into their city. In 2014, Mexican authorities announced that they would introduce a law that will allow police and their counterparts in other countries to seize and transfer tens of thousands of tons of narcotics worth millions of dollars from Mexican drug cartels linked to violent crime, where traffickers often trade for a high profit.","token_len":395,"entropy":[5.1083,7.437,3.4153,6.1586,3.3481,2.4978,5.0698,7.3856,1.5604,9.9932,2.9489,0.0894,2.1972,2.0696,0.0008,4.0552,1.3663,3.2843,10.8413,0.4484,5.4588,0.0692,0.023,3.4508,1.6226,0.6431,0.0002,0.0,10.9315,7.7038,0.1951,6.3316,7.0133,3.0055,0.4185,0.0383,4.6184,4.6444,1.8612,3.066,3.5113,3.1637,1.1448,3.0691,1.8171,2.5437,0.411,0.7596,0.147,1.0215,0.8866,2.6509,3.7693,6.7342,3.7784,5.6021,1.7465,2.1725,0.2484,5.8655,0.1849,4.0599,0.2272,3.1532,0.3733,7.9142,0.1846,2.2978,0.8264,1.0923,3.4715,2.0712,0.0631,0.0525,0.8763,0.0212,0.8492,1.4856,0.0008,5.3205,1.1757,0.9653,0.3948,1.4349,2.3131,1.0397,1.7314,0.0184,0.087,6.5108,0.6157,3.8039,0.5476,1.3019,1.4305,0.9959,1.4467,1.3062,1.7209,3.232,0.9376,0.1064,0.4824,1.0375,6.5437,12.2952,0.7365,2.0002,3.8693,0.6881,0.4722,0.8516,0.0872,0.0265,0.0028,2.9501,2.7462,0.3336,2.2047,3.3535,0.6531,0.0791,2.3432,3.334,4.0429,1.6266,4.6786,5.3568,1.3183,1.6032,0.9306,2.6673,2.494,0.3003,3.0717,2.3803,2.1491,0.0554,5.6306,0.9098,1.2438,1.213,2.0364,5.5475,2.2956,1.4554,1.1664,3.9788,0.3011,3.0055,3.502,2.7535,5.6807,5.9754,2.0356,0.1194,1.9471,4.9195,4.7654,5.1359,0.621,2.2643,5.6753,0.3129,1.053,5.8653,1.2421,2.764,3.3911,4.8151,4.6506,1.6974,3.857,5.454,2.4171,0.4858,1.5209,2.797,3.5304,4.2193,3.7402,6.0344,0.8061,0.0305,0.7362,2.7402,4.8306,0.3574,0.6203,4.5764,0.3541,4.9069,0.1006,2.4233,0.7823,3.825,0.0234,4.2402,1.8439,5.6241,1.4418,5.5261,3.5681,0.1013,2.276,0.8669,3.3586,0.5399,4.0603,5.7851,3.0812,2.7943,1.7736,4.4933,1.0053,4.5783,2.4503,1.4844,1.1224,5.7691,2.4249,1.472,2.0646,5.6423,1.8678,2.426,5.357,2.3062,2.1029,0.4336,2.4021,4.2735,0.2563,3.6369,3.6772,1.9294,4.9406,5.0206,5.6848,1.1076,2.8137,4.444,2.4652,2.8372,2.9844,0.0037,4.4608,0.7631,1.0471,2.3044,2.2672,0.0211,4.5166,0.236,3.0945,1.272,0.2265,3.5795,0.0487,2.0525,6.1176,2.3075,3.7476,2.2638,1.0091,4.7168,1.9351,1.7517,3.9016,6.2771,0.1111,3.5889,2.7114,1.4313,0.174,2.1177,3.4431,0.138,3.2636,4.2795,1.9934,0.9378,2.07,0.2241,2.7666,3.1798,0.155,5.7701,0.1242,0.7615,1.9454,4.6348,1.9505,5.7769,1.6731,3.6266,0.5245,4.4485,2.1498,0.9964,0.3126,5.6408,2.0217,4.8208,1.4829,5.766,0.0004,3.2512,2.8307,5.7865,6.0621,0.0726,2.1146,6.4037,2.3876,4.2447,1.2925,2.9865,3.3479,3.6524,1.316,3.2975,1.2293,4.5762,3.8678,4.124,0.4334,3.6005,0.7272,1.3553,0.0138,3.2246,2.3294,4.1316,0.6241,2.2733,2.7928,2.191,0.7759,2.6104,3.3472,0.1607,3.912,1.7434,3.5494,1.153,0.58,0.8543,5.0522,1.4277,1.9203,1.3662,3.1903,2.0862,2.7683,2.8819,5.0533,3.0429,0.8279,1.5972,0.9954,0.2518,2.2109,2.1045,4.575,4.9803,0.0047,0.7552,0.0112,2.1438,0.0132,2.4564,4.2109,3.0282,0.0844,0.5219,2.6542,3.2303,2.171,1.2449,5.8063,0.0267,4.012,1.2406,2.0693,5.7714,3.3343,2.6798,3.9858,3.4149,3.521,3.2204,3.2112,0.3511]}

During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump also used the hashtag #RussiaGate, and during his bid for the presidency, he has repeatedly denied meeting Russian officials or accepting payments from Russian banks.\n\nIn return for his testimony this week, he said Mr Trump would cooperate with congressional investigators into the election with an eye toward obtaining records that include any links or documents found on his personal devices, phone or e-mail.\n\n\"His public statements this week have been consistently and repeatedly critical of Democrats for saying, 'You know, what we're doing, we believe there's a problem with the Russians, but we have to figure out who did it,' \" Rep. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, which Mr Spicer will cover for the committee, told a Senate subcommittee on Wednesday.\n\nMr Trump promised to provide information to the committee next week, adding that he would provide it to every member of the public in the room, even though he is unaware that his conversations with Mr Spicer are the subject of a subpoena from the Intelligence Committee. He's the same man who asked in a speech at a congressional hearing in October to release copies of memos from the transition team detailing meetings between himself and then-president-elect Donald Trump during the campaign.\n\nHe went as far as calling the White House on Mr Spicer personally. \"I ask him if I know where his people are, and he doesn't know where his people are,\" Mr Spicer said, according to an excerpt published Monday in Politico magazine.","token_len":395,"entropy":[8.4097,1.17,2.4295,2.9219,4.4932,0.1909,1.8157,1.1807,0.021,0.6196,1.7913,2.5808,2.6902,2.6018,2.8323,5.5408,0.1797,4.5479,2.2847,1.8826,2.7471,2.9102,2.6878,2.766,1.4031,5.0805,0.0121,2.809,0.0375,3.4068,4.4481,1.0511,0.9575,3.3747,0.9581,1.3086,0.0851,0.1059,0.2422,3.7802,2.8479,0.1877,0.313,0.0004,3.5962,2.96,5.5803,0.3483,3.5536,2.8605,5.0013,0.7648,5.613,2.8907,4.6593,2.7348,5.6553,0.0074,0.0738,3.7318,3.4907,2.4341,4.4106,4.9749,5.9466,5.695,1.9627,1.0404,3.4543,6.0168,1.625,4.0027,1.3482,0.2464,6.2683,0.1216,2.4999,3.4482,1.9117,5.8875,1.6609,1.2578,2.1415,3.2152,1.4452,5.5121,5.2785,0.2879,5.3622,1.3081,0.8415,8.12,1.8155,6.0151,1.4732,0.1766,0.099,0.3599,4.018,2.8236,1.4118,1.9899,0.271,5.9131,0.4568,1.9389,2.8344,4.0823,0.8889,4.8072,0.122,0.3546,0.926,0.9008,0.8882,3.72,2.3076,2.182,6.3929,2.2451,0.6828,2.5542,5.2525,1.1171,0.2871,2.2987,1.0568,0.4027,0.1575,0.0003,3.2361,5.5449,0.8442,1.1312,0.5747,5.6753,0.1065,0.0775,3.9007,1.671,6.5169,0.9959,2.3253,3.3133,0.6945,1.3932,0.2269,2.3507,2.1421,4.2134,6.737,3.2416,0.6717,0.8189,4.5397,4.3551,2.659,6.5489,2.9814,4.3792,4.0857,4.4965,5.9979,3.1553,1.4747,1.3063,4.6591,2.1072,5.3713,1.3437,3.5443,0.0005,0.1278,1.4807,0.2937,0.0003,1.1893,5.7024,4.8857,0.6488,5.3461,0.1771,2.4808,1.4173,5.7395,2.8127,2.1107,3.8218,0.1431,6.2207,2.336,5.34,3.0872,0.3308,2.6964,0.7416,0.9569,4.1984,2.0083,1.4346,1.2036,2.7683,0.9735,6.683,3.2524,0.8859,1.493,3.7946,1.2038,1.6387,1.6025,1.4603,1.813,1.2232,2.8244,0.9188,3.3439,0.0954,2.2909,2.1403,0.496,1.2266,0.3505,5.5248,0.1179,4.1144,3.2516,0.9651,1.7234,1.8445,0.4842,0.0958,0.2824,5.1661,3.4604,4.9613,4.1052,5.6269,2.3791,1.6829,2.1836,0.1791,0.8315,4.2057,3.0862,3.02,1.1191,1.8352,0.1883,0.3191,0.0003,1.4384,1.2927,6.4073,1.1038,3.9385,3.5186,1.4053,1.3204,0.5659,4.6303,0.3112,1.5768,4.5886,0.5556,0.5098,0.7017,3.0224,1.4483,1.092,5.4442,1.111,0.1242,1.1479,3.225,3.1206,1.1582,3.4265,2.0653,3.4272,2.8193,0.8497,3.1017,5.783,2.2194,2.5281,4.7959,0.3804,1.7428,1.7147,2.3936,5.3028,0.2768,0.0029,1.7087,1.542,2.7039,0.2833,5.1925,0.1128,0.3056,3.4347,5.4797,5.2768,4.4677,1.654,0.2181,3.825,5.514,1.7609,4.5994,3.1282,1.5324,4.1546,0.3016,1.9541,2.9327,1.2513,3.4252,4.8425,0.0033,3.6225,2.3067,1.285,4.1432,0.1684,3.1822,4.0842,1.6467,3.6068,0.0643,2.8851,0.188,1.9349,1.0205,0.0021,0.2785,0.025,3.4583,0.4233,0.7659,0.4953,0.1666,0.0003,3.5588,5.9665,4.3206,0.0043,0.145,3.8996,1.956,3.4759,0.0004,4.8074,5.3039,0.2681,7.0152,2.7204,1.4237,1.2747,5.4734,1.6734,2.88,3.1622,3.637,2.8742,2.8123,5.2051,0.3921,1.596,1.3381,0.6747,3.9015,0.0009,2.1605,1.6133,1.7737,0.3485,0.0274,0.5686,0.4613,0.1318,0.4636,2.1229,1.3289,0.0011,3.2935,3.3984,3.6348,5.4764,1.5739,2.348,3.2489,0.1019]}

As a party that has always supported a separate sovereign and free settlement, we are delighted that the government has managed to agree to the deal, and the new trade agreement will go ahead, as it has so far,\" Mr Cameron said. \"The new powers will include the ability to control access to the single market, while bringing about significant reductions and reforms to protect the NHS and improve efficiency. \"We will also work closely with the UK on our EU free movement policy,\" he added.The prime minister said the package would allow for greater \"flexibility in the economic process\".The government is determined to ensure free movement is \"comprehensive and flexible across Europe\", and will work closely with other members of the European Union to address the challenges of trade and investment.\"The government believes that we are taking this to a different level,\" he said. \"The deal will give us further protection and, ultimately, greater access to the single market on our own terms - and this is a very important commitment. \"We remain hopeful that in the long-term, I am confident that we will do the right thing for our citizens in Northern Ireland.\"","token_len":395,"entropy":[3.3356,1.6469,2.8578,0.4652,2.8528,3.0957,2.3967,2.4283,1.9577,5.1208,4.8644,0.3436,0.1537,0.3536,6.0259,0.3689,1.0499,4.376,0.0246,2.3433,0.0016,3.7479,0.5823,1.4653,2.5521,4.4583,4.5441,3.121,1.8201,0.7325,3.8315,0.3651,1.408,1.4728,2.0636,0.077,7.6896,2.2823,3.9973,3.4795,1.9459,4.9565,0.5747,0.7967,1.5752,4.8256,2.2546,0.0731,2.0336,4.2596,4.2129,0.0441,0.4634,4.579,0.0364,1.6472,0.7598,0.0053,0.5608,3.8449,1.3875,2.3498,3.4217,2.4638,1.1932,0.8714,4.8345,1.3503,3.4361,3.9052,0.0469,1.975,4.0437,5.634,5.7439,1.2755,1.3693,5.5101,0.1191,3.462,1.9773,4.2589,4.0124,1.2256,2.9219,3.3566,2.9238,4.2652,0.934,0.4733,1.4354,2.3595,1.9096,2.0405,2.9551,2.2292,4.3712,0.3092,4.6099,3.1275,1.5518,3.7005,3.1235,0.2458,5.3583,0.2957,4.7834,4.5529,1.3109,3.9884,4.835,2.6432,0.6862,4.2458,0.8377,3.0651,4.1268,2.01,3.0788,6.9769,4.7351,1.673,0.5589,2.6609,0.0064,1.1006,2.0723,5.5151,1.384,1.6227,1.564,4.8684,4.9742,3.165,0.9572,2.5324,4.2605,3.6453,1.6599,0.4781,3.1868,2.751,0.2129,4.9542,4.6467,1.8703,5.8189,1.7418,4.8036,4.0943,3.1257,3.4735,1.0882,5.347,0.9669,1.4565,0.6406,2.432,3.0358,2.9422,2.1998,3.1306,1.8976,4.6708,3.9433,4.8157,2.4108,5.185,2.8792,1.6032,2.4258,2.7883,2.4688,5.8618,5.8741,3.9564,2.9145,6.4376,2.1675,1.6427,1.4781,5.2355,0.9617,0.9961,1.4664,0.6816,5.5786,0.0533,3.7308,1.5665,2.0154,3.9781,2.9279,2.1015,3.1816,3.7672,5.4895,2.3106,1.5195,4.6959,0.3829,3.5616,2.4684,2.215,1.3237,3.3308,0.2794,0.4912,1.4954,0.645,0.3154,0.7087,2.4392,1.961,3.3561,5.177,1.2944,3.8059,1.8994,1.7715,0.134,4.262,3.0072,0.1185,1.2098,0.416,0.0021,1.2451,5.1775,5.3901,2.7301,4.5585,3.3725,5.3238,3.8193,1.1624,6.0179,1.3447,2.5255,0.93,3.8331,5.0012,2.2365,1.7808,2.0726,0.9269,1.4257,3.5473,1.4335,0.089,0.682,3.1207,2.3594,3.3411,3.6957,5.245,1.1463,2.1963,5.4155,0.22,0.2748,0.2835,1.4883,2.7391,0.0079,1.3264,1.3558,5.9372,1.1403,3.4282,1.944,3.4366,4.5029,1.5505,0.0288,2.7045,1.1509,5.6619,5.0879,2.0487,2.1029,2.3135,2.3273,6.0108,0.0827,3.0864,5.496,0.4015,2.813,3.5059,5.2864,1.1217,0.0027,0.0262,1.1261,3.5038,2.9067,3.1042,1.2153,2.4119,2.3853,3.0272,1.2275,0.0272,2.7634,3.7219,0.3486,0.1068,1.1934,0.3721,1.0408,4.4957,1.0664,2.842,1.6155,4.1269,0.8338,0.4528,2.3669,1.7559,2.1069,3.6365,0.5261,3.0342,2.425,4.9477,3.3651,4.2208,1.7256,4.6414,0.3058,2.6155,1.0214,0.3328,0.2717,0.5327,1.996,4.8259,0.979,3.2315,1.0676,5.4838,6.4436,1.6795,5.4963,4.1474,0.0137,2.0574,3.1547,0.1133,0.5716,0.1637,0.0012,5.9943,3.4312,0.7165,0.8832,4.2974,1.9078,3.1753,1.3286,1.994,2.5181,0.9556,5.0706,2.2925,0.2392,1.4897,4.9081,3.6132,0.1973,4.3808,0.7125,3.2035,1.5873,0.1565,1.352,5.9418,2.5243,1.7642,0.9578,1.2401,0.6066,4.9903,2.2604,0.299,0.0511,0.9304,1.5996,2.5211,2.6024,1.7592,0.0009,1.9464]}

Both companies argued that Facebook's use of its social network violated its online privacy policies by blocking ads and removing the \"courageous\" content posted in Facebook's live feeds.\n\nFacebook raised its legal claims against Google last week, arguing that the company's policy could infringe on speech that could be critical to the public interest such as news reporting. Google also claimed that its decision to make social networking the domain of any ads on Facebook and other platforms violates its privacy rules.\n\nGoogle last week also said Facebook's use of social network was \"unreasonable\" because the company didn't want to affect Google's operations.\n\nAd networks have faced mounting criticism over their use of Facebook's social network, which generated millions of monthly active users. That's led to several recent lawsuits that have claimed that Facebook's Facebook page could be abused as a proxy to other social network sites.\n\nThe FCC's ruling can be appealed, and Google could argue that Google is using the political advertising policy as a platform for using its company's services and in effect blocking Facebook's advertising on Facebook at the expense of other sources of revenues.\n\n(Reporting by Jennifer Kortgill; Editing by Paul Shuster)","token_len":395,"entropy":[9.0148,5.6193,5.5911,0.2149,12.8282,8.9584,9.2717,2.3604,3.071,7.4662,3.0075,0.1395,0.0049,7.4546,0.8874,6.2688,8.5755,4.708,3.2349,1.5387,3.1441,0.001,2.5817,7.5197,0.0043,0.0036,0.035,3.9097,2.3826,2.8325,2.9766,6.067,0.1811,7.6162,5.5858,2.9949,5.0174,1.7363,2.2949,0.4649,4.0428,1.6214,0.1358,1.239,1.1625,0.0013,3.5661,0.1048,0.2345,0.0001,1.3302,3.2563,1.5843,5.2932,5.3926,3.7269,2.2938,3.2271,0.6294,2.8654,3.3171,0.1267,5.4212,4.3719,0.4135,5.0362,2.7926,2.2705,1.6254,2.1652,2.5632,1.9335,3.9312,5.8909,3.2756,1.7251,1.9108,5.5686,0.0011,2.2431,5.3778,5.2193,0.5914,3.9836,3.4937,1.8641,1.7185,0.7135,0.0001,3.1488,3.2551,0.8058,1.5285,2.8867,0.6464,2.3592,3.1064,3.5109,0.0496,0.2211,4.6517,5.8781,4.689,6.4699,1.1272,0.0317,2.3278,3.3137,3.767,0.0005,1.0284,4.7264,4.9864,1.0346,2.228,5.7454,0.9651,1.1837,0.4622,0.0001,4.2532,5.0225,1.9988,3.778,2.0592,3.4033,3.7138,4.3262,3.0778,0.6761,4.2191,1.6564,2.1947,1.0888,2.0099,1.5722,0.0085,3.3021,0.6874,2.1336,0.8383,2.2732,0.9942,5.5479,1.4895,0.1229,1.5587,1.9931,0.1402,0.5388,5.0457,0.2643,4.284,0.7405,2.0761,1.2306,1.6796,0.0433,2.0804,1.4714,0.2644,2.6978,1.9202,4.9834,0.6948,2.1685,3.46,2.0544,0.881,2.6109,5.8558,3.9647,3.6965,5.2797,2.9502,1.6904,0.5034,1.5349,4.9953,3.6965,3.0533,0.5927,5.6879,2.185,0.2621,0.1508,0.0001,3.5542,6.039,1.7575,1.7953,4.9889,1.4641,0.9101,2.5624,1.8459,1.2271,2.3778,0.3076,1.3485,1.5072,1.3535,5.1693,4.7537,5.3574,0.0004,0.4278,4.9273,3.6418,3.343,0.799,4.8924,1.1541,1.4121,2.9539,0.8822,4.2249,0.0026,4.9095,2.3807,0.8309,2.1395,2.6552,3.9395,0.4891,2.5902,4.4125,0.292,5.0878,4.2601,3.1206,4.2033,5.3884,0.2049,5.362,2.7617,2.6139,2.1277,3.4749,2.1408,4.3783,1.8545,1.4058,2.0304,3.119,0.4618,0.1517,0.0001,2.035,6.2288,0.6478,2.2888,2.7475,5.0794,1.2871,2.0143,0.0112,2.0012,1.8608,2.9501,2.1227,2.4291,2.5772,0.7793,2.6668,2.4107,0.7793,4.5171,0.0012,2.0694,0.7171,5.5213,3.8447,0.1578,4.6448,1.0581,0.6699,0.0001,4.1419,1.0081,1.4633,1.9664,4.6451,0.6239,1.3425,1.0955,0.4416,0.1427,0.7512,0.2728,0.3628,0.1446,0.9426,0.4198,3.0908,0.8108,0.0742,0.1776,0.1136,0.0281,0.9644,5.3221,2.7156,3.1635,0.4061,4.888,3.7706,1.6653,2.9632,0.851,4.6974,0.9284,1.5637,1.3225,3.791,2.3424,4.4846,0.714,5.1101,3.3762,0.2584,3.748,2.1533,2.7969,1.2162,1.9913,0.9333,1.0363,0.2576,0.0001,1.7113,1.296,1.3759,3.2893,5.7065,0.791,0.6519,2.1304,1.8675,2.1799,2.566,4.332,0.4858,2.8997,2.8481,3.8699,1.4054,5.6761,2.5681,1.3901,1.9757,0.4653,6.296,1.012,5.7751,1.1804,5.7244,0.2184,3.1239,2.8176,4.9931,5.173,1.7367,3.5845,1.79,3.1263,2.4069,1.656,6.2968,1.3394,2.4641,0.0012,0.9975,5.9932,0.6578,4.655,0.429,0.3678,0.0002,5.6741,0.3468,0.0905,4.4928,5.0365,4.5779,6.5653,1.1557,0.3106,0.0785,0.0021,3.7592,4.2931,1.3147,0.3926]}

The launch was reported on June 11.","token_len":395,"entropy":[9.7921,2.4908,2.3284,1.9871,0.5678,1.2769,1.4227,4.2484,1.236,8.0314,4.2149,0.7037,0.894,2.1934,0.0321,1.9134,8.6874,6.3333,1.1014,5.0287,0.4627,0.1001,0.2778,0.3064,0.0082,1.3413,1.4035,2.5487,3.9535,1.058,0.2983,0.0088,2.9038,0.9101,3.9074,1.5503,3.6703,3.5628,2.079,1.5742,1.6212,5.4903,0.0863,0.3474,0.0631,0.1363,0.1357,3.1788,4.1959,3.2209,0.2176,3.6033,5.5574,3.9762,0.5935,0.2258,4.6364,0.2775,1.3603,1.5587,1.3747,0.0035,2.4047,0.4235,0.3794,1.5035,0.0561,0.2825,0.6156,0.0003,1.4507,2.6405,3.2976,1.625,5.5788,1.5163,2.7573,5.596,0.9055,6.1079,0.1924,1.2664,3.9785,4.5035,3.35,0.7344,6.1799,3.8119,3.6006,2.6106,4.048,5.2631,0.6371,5.5251,1.6346,1.2134,3.507,1.3786,0.9163,0.0003,1.3693,1.76,5.1566,0.8403,4.6714,4.4322,4.1593,2.3321,0.0757,0.0012,0.6832,0.0363,2.0068,3.7285,0.8388,2.4398,3.5629,5.4004,2.814,3.166,1.1243,3.6787,5.3675,0.4944,0.3812,4.4511,0.63,5.2761,1.3471,0.1505,2.2695,5.8243,0.4293,1.6255,0.7296,4.3167,1.6146,4.0861,1.4916,0.3287,5.0306,0.1919,4.9184,0.0149,1.3639,2.0576,3.4535,2.0311,3.4671,4.2069,4.429,0.8954,0.3535,0.0003,1.4335,5.8046,0.4826,0.0258,0.5575,0.0221,0.0053,0.0015,4.8458,1.0183,0.132,2.5035,4.4686,1.0368,2.8809,4.1522,0.1199,5.3723,1.0599,5.2224,2.3676,4.9808,1.6078,1.3459,0.5678,4.9068,0.9434,3.7365,2.6984,0.983,6.0278,3.7769,1.2277,2.4957,4.6977,2.1816,0.7862,2.1489,2.8127,3.1283,2.8747,5.0478,1.1918,1.429,1.7742,4.8582,0.8933,3.6735,1.3235,4.2387,3.3978,0.0652,3.5196,0.915,0.0046,2.3153,5.345,0.2462,4.9687,0.4989,2.3398,2.0517,4.2168,1.4597,0.6714,2.7369,0.0229,2.4056,1.3092,5.2675,4.3799,0.6699,0.4677,0.6707,5.1402,0.4833,0.2866,0.0002,1.438,5.1562,0.0844,1.0742,2.1551,2.2068,0.2421,3.4427,4.5682,2.0737,0.7647,0.741,1.8718,4.9621,1.4997,1.9786,3.1446,0.3374,2.2656,0.1389,0.3919,0.2684,0.5711,0.0002,1.3839,3.9977,0.9386,6.3322,1.0784,4.4678,0.5396,3.9955,6.5884,0.9114,5.3648,1.9655,2.5027,1.5981,3.8191,0.9714,2.3871,7.2868,1.0271,2.6925,2.3336,0.0006,1.3533,1.5884,5.7694,0.6173,0.9299,1.6114,0.0492,1.763,1.3158,2.9105,0.0882,4.4008,2.0652,2.2971,0.2023,0.6508,0.8443,0.0006,1.5399,0.523,5.1903,2.8747,2.9486,4.8947,2.0085,2.8808,1.7374,5.6954,1.0935,1.6291,3.2653,0.6879,1.0872,2.9752,0.0693,0.5759,0.5525,0.0002,1.3958,5.8596,5.2116,0.0935,0.0527,1.1535,1.8754,1.446,3.3734,1.6345,1.899,1.3564,0.6396,2.0368,5.4364,0.5428,0.007,5.7052,1.0264,2.8455,1.9646,0.205,5.0977,2.4451,5.1444,0.2937,0.0001,0.002,1.5017,2.5256,0.0263,1.1324,1.3242,0.9849,1.369,1.681,0.5061,0.9061,3.7123,3.4171,1.2221,0.6687,5.4612,2.6349,0.7479,5.1484,4.656,4.7214,0.2628,1.6646,7.3786,5.9264,2.8136,1.0726,0.1295,5.0001,2.8235,4.9779,2.1616,0.1763,1.1348,3.1474,3.9612,2.541,4.3942,0.1557,0.0249,1.0138,0.0161,1.0866,2.3306,5.2336,0.779,3.6062,2.947,2.2616,2.406,0.6728]}

However, he said that \"the Security Council has no business dealing with the extremist group\" and the Security Council must act in a way to prevent that from happening.\n\nThe Council has said it would work with Arab states \"as well as countries that share their national security interests in order to ensure peace and prevent sectarian extremism in the Middle East.\"\n\nIt is not the first time ISIL has been targeted by a jihadist attack in Syria, a year ago in which six of its commanders were killed, in an attack that left a suicide bomber dead.","token_len":396,"entropy":[7.5906,9.6255,3.8011,3.4542,2.2914,1.1083,10.6993,11.6706,9.3095,1.1638,14.0997,0.31,2.9958,6.3367,1.414,0.0054,5.9373,6.7174,2.5768,5.0476,1.4968,0.0168,10.2452,1.5292,4.9436,3.4765,0.8653,10.4895,0.576,1.4334,0.2308,7.1498,8.5408,3.2034,0.0688,0.8164,4.0935,1.7143,0.2036,4.0703,2.4143,0.0457,0.6185,1.9336,0.0084,3.3167,0.9571,1.6991,0.8236,0.52,0.0003,4.3374,0.3037,0.4599,1.1553,5.8672,2.6033,1.1414,4.4304,0.9482,5.8095,5.6298,0.376,2.69,4.1962,5.3996,4.7629,1.1719,0.5886,1.9663,1.0272,2.7583,3.1585,1.8116,2.1841,6.3389,3.5975,5.8111,0.6003,4.2907,0.8963,0.8537,0.7019,5.5328,6.3523,0.6558,4.78,0.0105,0.8948,4.6304,0.859,1.4911,3.1782,3.8523,5.3023,1.71,2.9568,1.3676,0.3262,0.0002,4.3563,1.2718,1.6872,5.3807,1.4558,0.001,2.8285,2.1605,5.7002,0.7705,1.4178,1.7187,4.0012,0.0231,4.9794,3.9211,4.2498,1.8531,0.2442,1.8101,0.0019,5.3649,2.8731,1.3201,3.2381,1.3505,4.186,3.2693,4.7745,1.3922,2.3648,0.3148,3.4924,1.0537,0.8318,0.0025,5.4887,0.7212,1.6391,0.8244,5.824,0.0003,0.3984,3.7357,1.0484,0.4757,4.4993,4.0581,1.9074,0.0946,6.7898,3.1553,4.9155,3.8213,0.4742,0.4703,0.0003,3.3774,1.8363,0.9663,0.5915,0.9589,4.0884,0.2812,0.3462,2.1699,0.0588,1.4047,4.469,1.7984,5.8161,3.1795,1.7966,3.4396,3.6383,1.0363,0.9238,0.9534,0.944,3.0959,4.8153,2.6958,2.2359,1.3212,6.1504,2.3793,0.0652,4.8678,1.4676,0.4301,5.7889,0.8457,1.1546,2.4536,2.8625,4.9676,1.3391,1.6236,0.496,0.0003,5.4223,0.0563,2.5551,1.1603,1.1555,4.928,2.196,4.5892,0.7096,1.2877,4.5194,0.8279,2.3626,3.0993,2.1893,0.0005,0.004,0.5488,0.3154,1.1965,1.3376,0.8839,2.5877,5.0884,2.3547,0.0015,1.0355,0.4699,2.8865,3.3906,1.7891,0.838,2.3839,0.7945,0.567,4.0885,2.7218,0.0251,5.0238,0.3899,1.065,4.719,1.3692,2.6296,3.0499,5.7043,6.5842,0.1183,1.0021,3.8882,0.0299,4.0197,0.0002,1.2364,0.7366,0.0003,5.4266,1.4741,0.9076,0.046,0.0012,0.0232,0.0112,1.5638,6.0098,3.2327,3.1738,0.003,2.0257,2.2088,5.6566,2.6749,5.8809,0.4219,5.3498,6.5202,4.9287,2.0528,5.8238,0.6159,3.8478,4.3478,1.6595,0.4883,5.3364,0.0988,0.475,1.4979,1.7607,3.1243,1.7019,2.3505,0.0021,2.6089,2.3146,5.3635,4.0987,0.0523,1.8466,5.3457,2.7011,3.2167,0.4144,3.4673,1.8013,0.0023,2.2601,2.306,2.2659,1.4922,1.2516,1.4076,2.2975,4.1348,0.9322,0.0741,0.3124,0.5361,0.0003,1.8552,2.9437,2.1876,4.9277,0.9891,1.6401,3.649,0.5378,4.1131,1.5247,4.0876,3.8111,1.8204,0.024,3.4167,2.0413,2.7049,1.4464,4.254,2.1334,0.2212,2.3306,1.2009,0.0293,1.6712,2.7964,0.5627,5.7694,5.6872,5.1104,2.0656,0.378,2.2108,0.0045,0.9616,0.8066,0.0004,3.6253,2.7958,1.874,0.8051,0.0215,0.0209,6.6315,0.2375,2.1573,1.9671,1.045,2.9534,3.8652,1.9984,0.8502,1.1583,2.0146,4.4164,3.7973,0.681,2.8311,0.7126,4.4936,4.1462,0.2292,5.156,0.2905,0.0974,2.931,4.0046,2.7393,0.7238,0.8484,2.3584,4.0309,3.4914,0.0799,1.2615,0.7698]}

The suspect had fled from a hospital and is suspected of working with drug traffickers, state media reported at the time.\n\nThe World Bank condemned Brazil during the global financial crisis in November as \"the most dangerous country in the world and the world.\" It added that some 80 million people had lost their homes, and 2.9 million people were facing physical or emotional poverty.\n\nIn the first 10 months of 2017, the Brazilian economy posted a record-breaking 3.86% net import receipts, with exports soaring 40% year-over-year, surpassing exports from the same period in February.\n\nAn influx of U.S. cash recently allowed Brazil to boost exports, and to cut its import dependence on foreign direct investment, prompting lawmakers to impose tough sanctions on individuals and companies. The latest package of restrictions on cash and goods is largely symbolic, but with potential political repercussions in a country such as Brazil that has been subject to political turmoil recently.

Police spokesman Major Al-Nader Khorim said 22 were wounded on Friday while four others died in intensive care. In all, three are expected to survive.\n\nThe bomber blew himself up at the Mogadishu police building using gas grenades and two firecrackers, said Ahmed Abuzadi, spokesman for the al Qaeda-linked al Qaeda affiliate in Kenya, or AQIM. He appeared to give his name and his social status to his brother, who was also injured in the attack.\n\n\"I am very sad for the victims but for my brothers,\" he said, with a tearful look on his face. Al Qaeda members later reportedly took revenge on the policeman who blew himself up, his brother said.\n\nHe was also killed in a car crash that had apparently gone wrong when the car crashed into the police training school, and an officer was seriously injured when he fell to his death, Khorim said.\n\nOfficials blamed police, armed with sledgehammers and a rocket pistol, for the blast and said the car was attacked after it stopped in traffic when traffic was not allowed to cross the highway where they were working.\n\nThe attack, which killed two officers, was deemed a \"flagrant terrorist attack\", and officials warned there was a \"bogus atmosphere\" in Somalia after several recent bombings.\n\nThe two officials who were killed at the training camp had been fighting in a fight against an Islamist rebel group led by Islamist militant al-Shabab, who has been using the Somali capital as a base to carry out its attacks on police and security forces in the north of the country. U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice denounced the attacks on police and security forces as \"one of the most violent acts in our nation's history.\"","token_len":396,"entropy":[10.521,0.5815,4.721,0.0585,0.3612,3.6738,2.4705,0.0249,0.0029,3.5261,0.6377,2.9028,5.7342,1.9768,0.5431,5.504,12.1575,13.0258,0.2796,0.0,0.0003,0.9644,2.0927,3.6404,0.7415,0.9872,0.0,3.4507,4.1973,1.1122,3.424,0.1714,0.194,5.9557,3.6226,4.5006,4.4756,1.8353,3.1045,5.7758,5.3922,4.3627,5.3983,0.657,5.1055,2.7027,1.4264,5.6608,2.6256,4.0765,3.4554,1.0897,2.0976,1.2011,4.5544,0.0434,1.1565,5.3815,4.6408,0.1649,3.6896,4.4686,4.5289,0.0151,0.3292,0.6015,0.8941,0.0003,1.6543,3.3612,2.4194,0.0098,0.0084,2.5775,1.2414,3.6691,0.0004,0.0032,0.8154,5.3301,5.1973,6.3339,1.8171,1.052,4.7804,5.5111,0.7273,0.0018,0.5229,3.1437,4.2454,4.1933,5.3478,3.8597,0.1245,2.1882,0.1092,0.3739,4.995,2.3262,0.3245,0.1422,3.0533,2.3084,2.6661,1.4059,3.8881,1.6935,3.5149,1.2837,0.1794,0.2995,1.9061,5.1758,0.2819,6.8591,2.2018,1.0777,3.1602,4.2406,5.4505,3.2153,1.5965,3.0451,2.8887,1.0464,1.0282,1.4665,1.9258,2.4562,1.3987,0.0558,0.5943,0.5913,0.5389,0.0002,1.799,3.0384,2.2884,2.6714,2.3073,2.5652,0.6656,2.2781,4.0308,4.3577,3.6816,2.1003,2.5893,1.2222,0.3622,1.6467,5.6428,1.355,3.9501,0.4452,1.7735,0.2877,0.0192,0.0184,0.2676,6.2537,0.463,5.0845,5.8569,5.6429,3.6594,4.0092,0.9921,0.79,5.9336,2.2416,1.4955,0.2836,0.0156,1.5062,4.8026,1.0016,0.7975,0.2347,0.341,0.0001,4.196,2.7738,3.4798,3.1915,1.0477,0.9329,3.3131,2.8448,2.6221,4.6002,4.666,4.0625,1.1736,2.04,1.3561,2.3071,3.7768,0.6683,1.5283,1.0772,2.1776,5.9469,1.409,3.4522,4.0428,3.8571,1.1765,3.0856,0.4345,1.9667,1.1861,2.1782,1.7082,1.4119,0.146,1.7907,3.1378,0.0093,0.0006,0.1328,0.0706,0.4315,0.0002,5.8702,4.3852,5.7901,3.7245,5.3008,0.8175,4.5463,0.3112,0.0199,0.0001,0.6975,3.0452,2.9298,8.9023,0.2188,0.4142,0.2863,2.767,2.5195,0.7674,1.4902,4.5451,1.4996,4.7412,3.5502,2.0644,3.169,1.9815,3.2654,4.5247,6.2878,1.9493,3.9809,2.0258,0.5866,2.2161,0.7196,2.2626,6.1424,3.365,0.7556,3.7983,0.5462,0.6162,0.0002,1.6521,2.377,2.8747,0.6915,2.5993,2.5043,1.9482,1.1445,1.6727,5.9501,1.1266,1.8524,5.1155,0.0029,2.1471,0.7001,2.6081,3.1338,4.1914,3.8677,4.3231,0.9809,1.3278,1.6851,5.1167,4.0917,0.0021,2.8707,0.1398,1.0308,1.2468,2.4904,4.4658,4.8273,3.1178,1.9123,0.4811,0.0002,1.8374,4.6767,5.308,3.0351,1.5168,1.3112,3.9689,0.1412,1.3309,0.33,3.3381,0.9381,4.2654,2.1527,3.6889,3.8383,2.4157,3.6783,1.9481,4.1408,0.1887,4.3926,0.0077,4.6007,1.6858,4.4729,0.9838,0.2298,0.2286,0.0036,0.9799,3.8796,2.143,1.6394,4.7983,1.6261,3.4799,0.7891,1.5895,0.4357,0.2151,1.6601,2.0155,0.0039,3.5221,1.3916,2.7936,1.3128,0.6421,1.4445,0.2213,2.1954,0.9421,2.7189,2.4155,0.0667,0.031,0.2413,7.2264,0.0406,0.1391,0.2779,3.9601,2.7886,0.0027,5.8615,0.2935,2.218,2.2804,1.8822,0.7628,0.3776,0.437,1.6789,0.6929,5.4239,0.3076,0.1046,1.2624,4.9569,1.3951,2.0653,1.1547,1.7197,0.0141,0.0479,1.1857]}

A change would increase the tax rate from 15 per cent to 20 per cent on business profits and income above $250,000. It would boost the marginal tax rate for people earning more than $250,000 by 10pc.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut also has taken a softer line, saying some of the changes won't address the problem. \"It would be great for our country if the president's not talking about a $2 million cut to the average American tax rate when he is trying to get a tax cut for the wealthy,\" he said in a statement.\n\nMr. Clinton has publicly proposed eliminating the deduction for capital gains, but Republican lawmakers have said the changes don't provide enough benefit to those who work hard and invest at home. At a White House campaign stop on Monday, Trump expressed support for a tax break for large corporations like General Electric, Boeing and General Motors.\n\n\"It is not necessary to have a federal tax structure that is too high on business and too generous in return,\" he said. \"There is a wealth of deductions in the system which allows people to make a great money making contribution, where wages go up or wages go down.\"","token_len":396,"entropy":[10.163,3.3628,2.6185,6.8737,0.406,6.3045,0.9949,9.1902,0.8628,6.7136,0.9698,1.044,2.6319,9.9572,7.0805,0.5563,3.12,7.0535,4.8822,0.6387,4.1209,6.4483,1.8567,2.4461,0.6087,8.9167,4.5336,2.8774,2.0843,7.6847,8.2729,1.9414,2.3598,1.6054,0.1203,0.1627,0.0002,5.6257,0.0797,3.0294,1.992,5.3391,4.9407,2.4555,0.5083,0.817,5.1401,0.0985,4.7227,0.8891,2.4714,5.2981,2.1041,4.4712,5.3294,0.3458,1.3138,5.8287,0.0615,0.0492,0.6117,2.3676,1.3582,1.3878,0.0014,1.1016,0.98,0.0002,5.7042,3.0726,4.2129,0.0008,0.24,2.2743,0.4489,1.9055,1.3891,1.7014,0.0006,1.6271,4.5348,0.0052,2.4085,0.221,2.7847,1.4005,3.7871,1.0378,0.5322,4.297,3.4183,1.7868,3.2812,2.8942,2.0519,5.0468,3.2157,2.6665,2.2834,0.4803,0.0002,1.5746,2.201,0.0013,4.4656,1.5316,2.4222,3.7937,0.356,3.2092,0.4183,5.1412,3.3809,0.5434,1.6031,0.1077,0.1289,0.0124,0.0002,0.0002,0.2665,0.0434,4.4749,0.0839,0.0006,0.0876,0.004,0.0021,0.0002,0.5028,2.9491,0.6499,3.6346,0.3405,0.5215,5.8828,0.0294,1.1792,0.8749,2.0796,2.4574,0.3833,0.5744,5.6359,0.2145,3.2996,0.2893,0.0317,0.0379,0.0052,0.5859,0.0008,0.0028,3.348,4.7193,5.3694,1.032,4.2619,0.2813,2.8769,0.9784,1.7718,2.8368,4.4033,0.0034,0.0633,0.8437,0.046,0.0001,2.6085,3.5718,3.382,1.5386,5.6454,1.9626,0.0934,1.6064,0.0208,0.0011,0.5935,4.2913,0.284,6.6644,0.5607,5.5449,0.8574,0.0547,1.7421,3.5043,1.5339,1.0663,0.0012,0.0151,0.6296,0.0019,0.001,2.2785,2.5862,7.6164,0.8538,0.219,0.0003,5.7117,3.0887,0.0018,3.0403,0.2377,1.6437,0.0009,3.0602,3.385,5.5587,1.216,4.4622,0.4486,1.5571,0.8773,5.7396,1.7204,0.3727,1.4566,5.0245,0.0005,5.5068,0.6568,2.3718,1.107,1.7915,2.397,3.4346,0.8543,3.9445,1.8697,2.9258,1.6933,0.7271,2.1151,1.9789,3.922,5.6033,3.2788,0.0791,3.5601,3.8981,3.3008,2.6081,2.9538,1.0687,0.6744,5.5975,1.6509,4.1012,0.8632,5.4529,0.6414,2.7855,4.54,0.0054,3.0743,2.9422,1.7916,0.4038,0.5518,1.2854,2.3131,0.3176,0.3516,0.1792,1.3772,0.3742,0.2205,0.1661,0.3246,0.0002,2.108,0.0007,4.2333,1.4588,5.7088,5.1721,1.7872,0.4391,1.9251,0.9199,2.2914,0.0144,1.6048,1.7021,4.5743,2.6897,0.7923,1.7735,1.7303,3.1867,4.7436,0.0002,4.3088,0.3505,3.8106,0.847,3.4894,1.2405,4.6529,1.149,1.2907,2.4971,4.9135,1.2911,0.3641,6.1199,0.9633,3.3787,0.0006,4.6904,0.667,1.5396,1.486,0.1445,5.5755,5.4081,1.7269,0.0296,2.2236,2.7911,2.6145,0.1304,4.375,1.2479,5.6636,3.6495,0.7639,1.2713,5.401,0.5344,1.9332,0.1571,0.9017,0.3115,0.0002,2.134,2.7804,1.905,3.0493,4.7951,0.6455,2.9583,0.9377,5.4974,1.4583,5.4411,0.6249,1.5778,4.019,1.3474,4.9712,4.5686,1.937,0.8457,2.1434,3.5515,4.3898,1.1958,0.993,0.0834,0.4279,0.8685,3.5557,0.8227,1.6412,5.3448,0.1315,5.474,3.0765,1.0572,2.6009,4.5019,4.5175,2.428,0.1822,1.5633,1.9028,2.9329,4.7862,3.1935,2.4892,2.4841,5.993,6.2255,2.381,0.4301,2.7463,2.3684,0.0681,0.011,1.8933]}

But a ban on Russia taking part in the Winter Olympics is likely to make support for him even more so.\n\nIn the coming months Russia will be able to prove to the world that it is not only willing to spend heavily on social reform but also for the long term. The Russian government may be facing a new challenge from those who would make up the majority of its citizens after Putin and the Putin government.\n\nIt is a very serious problem for Russia, especially for the long-term, and the Russian economy itself has taken a sharp dive. On the other hand, the European Union and US could have a very decisive effect for Russia as well as the Eurozone as a whole.\n\nFor any one or a few, the long-term future is bleak. Although the Russian economy has enjoyed record recovery this year, its growth rate can not be forecast to recover as it has never recovered from the recession it experienced, and there are serious issues about the size of oil reserves and its relationship with the outside world.\n\nFinally, there is not a great deal of hope of having a smooth integration of the new world order with Russia. If the future of the world is to remain peaceful, a political transition away from Putin and the Putin government, and towards the new world order will have to start from within. Otherwise the current regime will collapse, and the prospect of an even more destructive political coup is unlikely to happen.\n\nWe will leave you with a short history lesson as to how Putin became Putin that can help us understand this situation and will guide us next steps. And when you see how it comes up, let us know.\n\n* This content on our Facebook page is in no way affiliated with Yalta Media.

He said the bureau was \"concerned about Russia's purported efforts to interfere in our election process and the potential for criminal action from the Trump administration.\"\n\nDemocratic National Committee spokeswoman Hope Hicks also said on Twitter that any allegations of obstruction of justice by Comey \"raise more questions than answers.\"\n\nNo details have been provided as to whether Attorney General Jeff Sessions will be interviewed by Senate Judiciary Committee and House Judiciary Committee investigators. Sessions, who has not indicated a willingness to participate in any such hearing, made some of the comments after his recusal from oversight of the Justice Department. Comey said that when he was asked about those reports, Comey said: \"I'm not going to discuss that.\"\n\nSenate Democrats on Thursday charged the president might not have properly vetted the investigation, which was set up in response to a 2014 meeting between Clinton aides and Comey.\n\nDuring his statement Thursday, Comey said he is \"confident\" that the FBI had concluded that two days into the investigation that included emails that had been purged that might have violated the law and led to a warrantless interception of email under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The FBI then conducted a search of the emails, but only after their contents had been \"reviewed carefully and at the request of the Department of Justice.\"\n\n(Reporting by Lisa Shumaker; Editing by James Dalgleish)","token_len":397,"entropy":[9.0014,7.7001,6.2894,0.4848,3.9098,0.1177,0.2485,0.0316,3.9561,0.0057,1.9511,2.6426,1.6822,6.9309,4.853,1.1493,4.7509,2.0167,2.2747,2.1619,3.2092,3.8787,9.5272,3.11,1.2451,6.0633,0.551,0.0027,0.0166,8.3086,0.0091,3.8594,0.1193,6.0599,1.5208,1.4042,4.7227,0.0959,1.0781,0.8685,0.4569,1.4945,0.0157,0.1793,0.659,0.0007,0.0577,0.1169,0.071,0.0509,3.7522,3.7363,1.8762,1.4873,1.342,4.1345,0.0655,3.3249,1.7339,5.0154,2.8519,4.3253,1.0414,1.0858,2.9261,0.5718,0.3138,5.5358,1.0114,0.2409,0.0002,5.4287,2.1251,2.5561,3.0506,0.6237,0.6905,5.2182,0.328,3.2763,4.0479,0.6381,0.9004,0.3568,3.1289,1.4015,1.0492,3.0249,0.9717,0.0002,3.2925,0.0,2.7189,1.507,0.5525,0.6908,4.0312,7.0815,1.5601,0.5235,1.2912,0.0012,3.9711,3.94,0.7527,0.2889,2.4278,2.1842,2.0462,0.4557,0.7318,1.7353,5.5177,1.974,5.2589,0.2466,2.1479,0.8703,3.8776,1.4854,1.8985,1.1605,1.7692,3.3673,2.128,1.9274,4.9782,0.1218,1.4352,6.2619,0.3282,6.8308,1.7389,0.0853,0.6064,0.2112,0.773,0.323,2.9995,1.6692,2.8217,2.2948,0.7064,3.9292,4.0572,3.4526,0.911,1.0415,0.6784,0.321,0.1217,0.0002,4.7004,2.3781,0.0024,3.1051,1.3804,0.0001,3.3531,1.1034,1.72,1.4471,0.5805,7.0288,4.6385,0.8583,3.1436,0.2719,0.01,3.1422,1.7878,2.4811,5.2775,4.4649,0.2112,0.1359,1.0681,0.4033,0.1936,0.0002,5.8266,4.7277,2.3224,0.1096,1.8032,2.2053,0.0439,1.3842,5.2501,0.0011,0.0326,0.0001,2.3643,1.6917,3.48,0.7275,5.4505,2.072,0.1074,4.5449,2.7184,1.8444,0.2449,0.8145,0.8884,2.7912,2.3348,0.9198,1.5204,2.3283,4.2834,3.1851,2.7289,0.0071,4.4667,0.3029,1.8187,3.4783,3.7359,0.0798,5.724,5.8783,1.7119,0.6219,2.2801,3.4278,3.1966,2.9407,0.002,0.8172,5.6982,0.3484,0.4641,1.8162,0.0018,1.3938,4.4824,2.0455,2.9657,4.1914,0.597,1.3308,1.3122,0.8631,3.1678,5.2435,0.7465,2.5319,1.1731,2.4071,0.0656,0.7847,2.0603,0.5297,0.7025,0.0252,2.9596,1.7047,1.2283,0.1945,0.0003,4.2825,2.3825,2.0081,1.4181,5.2432,3.0678,2.2576,6.504,3.301,0.783,5.3334,3.359,0.825,2.1686,2.086,1.9796,2.1979,4.4637,0.8664,2.4151,2.5632,0.0023,1.2568,3.5282,5.7883,0.5247,4.5187,3.1104,0.289,4.1796,0.8704,0.9144,0.0002,5.2196,1.9821,5.0883,3.9004,0.1529,0.6004,0.6348,1.2147,4.0937,1.2502,2.6158,0.0136,0.8581,0.4993,1.05,1.1974,3.1696,3.8756,0.5256,6.5658,5.3298,4.3985,0.2854,0.5516,3.8687,4.5569,2.9935,2.2229,2.299,0.6475,5.4111,0.3614,6.1434,3.0778,0.5662,3.6069,0.7938,0.4649,2.3966,5.4757,0.0525,2.3107,5.0651,1.5704,6.3384,0.2927,4.2018,6.2025,1.0724,1.1923,0.0112,0.0001,0.0292,0.6793,2.9165,1.3446,3.7738,3.6063,1.1066,3.667,0.2686,0.9893,1.6894,1.5266,2.2782,4.0114,0.9738,5.2228,3.0508,1.904,0.0901,4.0218,3.6548,5.6086,1.3798,5.3666,1.2716,1.9355,0.0385,0.3814,2.6846,0.1745,0.0196,0.4985,0.2161,0.0002,5.7997,0.4295,0.0558,4.1031,0.534,0.0978,0.0258,0.3749,0.1517,0.0017,4.2514,0.0299,0.0185,0.0254,0.0001,0.4251]}
{"id":1790,"ended":true,"length":374,"gen_text":"A 15 percent corporate tax rate backed by President Donald Trump may not be possible, but businesses will see a \u201c competitive \u201d rate as Republicans push their tax reform plan through Congress, especially after its success in repealing and replacing Obama's stimulus package. The American Chamber of Commerce says it will continue to support the president's plan and is willing to keep supporting the GOP measure, despite its failure to achieve enough votes on the House floor last week.\n\nThere are also lingering questions about the proposed corporate rate. The latest IRS memo on what might have to be covered by the House-passed measure notes that $1,600 for every $1 you pay has to be paid by Americans. This could have a significant impact on how large companies are able to work with employees\u2014who are paying a 20 percent rate\u2014while companies may not be able to pay their workers the same rate. But the issue makes some sense.\n\nThis week, the Federal Election Commission rejected a request from the Campaign Legal Center to change the way it evaluates whether a company should pay its workers a rate based on some of the company's actual workforce needs. Based on the information in the memo, which is expected to become public later in September, the agency told the center it does not discuss rates but is trying to identify potential factors where the company might not be able to meet the cost-benefit analysis.\n\nIn January, then-Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was asking the FEC for more information about how the agency's business division should answer questions in response to a 2015 congressional request as to how much of an employee's salary or compensation would have to be paid by a company that pays workers an hourly rate that comes within its specific budget and also the business divisions' annual budget. The request was largely for guidance but included an array of issues, including questions about whether the president's tax proposal would increase the corporate tax rate and, where possible, how that would affect businesses.","token_len":397,"entropy":[7.7764,5.3295,8.6646,0.303,0.9062,11.4864,0.4313,6.1245,2.2356,0.0219,5.8073,1.8397,0.6767,5.02,1.5251,1.241,6.9517,2.9558,4.8139,1.5833,17.6027,7.8846,9.9862,9.7347,5.5925,4.7867,3.5745,9.8779,3.7671,3.6478,1.5765,2.0599,1.5509,0.7817,0.1729,2.8251,4.4231,2.6237,5.4231,4.671,0.7032,2.9759,0.5117,0.0292,3.766,0.4361,5.5937,1.9415,0.3214,3.4375,4.8426,1.8827,0.0086,0.0,2.8962,1.5524,1.6064,2.8771,0.2205,2.4085,1.0299,3.9649,0.1917,1.1784,2.7995,2.5719,4.8064,0.0079,5.6018,2.6351,1.5124,3.8279,5.1452,2.5692,2.8711,2.3838,3.1513,0.7839,3.4872,4.4462,1.4787,3.4431,0.9881,0.5546,0.3572,4.0724,0.4693,0.4494,0.6332,0.0003,5.568,1.099,2.433,5.8078,1.1694,0.4468,1.3302,5.3984,3.1809,3.069,2.0453,1.9075,5.5671,5.5976,4.9411,3.0696,5.9598,5.0689,3.4511,2.9665,0.5701,5.5747,0.9829,0.7037,4.5001,3.5026,0.0197,0.0053,3.3899,3.9517,0.2348,5.5582,1.9906,1.7387,4.0195,2.5886,1.0956,0.511,0.5692,4.9229,2.2257,4.8568,0.3201,0.161,1.0485,1.9268,4.149,1.3534,3.7917,3.3266,3.7386,1.6565,2.2159,0.3823,0.1398,2.7958,4.2714,2.1598,1.8814,1.8622,0.0055,5.459,2.3128,4.9049,5.512,4.2446,2.065,4.9033,2.3576,4.681,0.0532,1.9354,2.3544,3.1068,3.5661,3.5113,1.559,1.0515,0.2041,0.0172,2.8067,2.647,1.6083,2.0624,0.7017,1.0432,0.8377,4.6965,1.5399,5.5849,6.7407,4.178,0.8396,1.8227,1.891,0.0002,4.6788,4.2014,0.5216,1.178,4.5414,2.4688,0.0055,5.8715,0.9714,1.8855,0.8495,0.9861,4.8377,0.2214,0.0031,0.8041,4.6254,0.4785,3.0392,1.67,3.822,2.1827,1.5075,1.6367,2.8965,1.354,0.9611,0.5126,1.3139,1.7291,2.0345,0.0595,5.3955,2.3928,0.6206,1.9479,0.0126,5.272,5.0541,4.1318,0.2786,6.2222,0.0337,1.1653,4.1431,4.2945,0.2852,2.906,0.1731,5.4734,2.1532,3.2399,0.0547,4.3909,0.3984,2.8325,3.7072,3.4458,0.0332,0.4789,3.3766,5.657,0.8238,5.6156,1.2799,3.6151,0.0388,6.3513,3.6374,4.6529,2.9378,5.0026,0.0285,4.3162,2.8324,3.2208,5.2038,1.8812,2.6333,1.1363,2.3213,0.514,0.4365,0.0124,1.0032,2.0278,4.859,1.5326,0.9745,0.4521,0.835,0.5915,0.0002,3.2867,5.0974,0.0982,5.7398,0.037,2.9336,0.0034,4.1648,0.0008,0.5672,0.0083,0.0696,0.1005,0.0836,4.3621,5.677,0.7021,0.9627,2.0872,2.3695,0.8161,0.9044,1.267,1.7646,3.0906,3.4506,4.2792,4.3862,4.1676,5.3666,0.9157,4.5513,2.7573,0.0047,2.258,4.0837,4.2814,2.7164,7.1728,1.4775,1.493,2.2068,2.6417,2.1324,3.034,0.4447,1.535,2.7369,3.0207,2.2425,1.6536,0.0841,0.1136,1.1985,1.469,1.6827,0.3772,3.153,3.1952,3.4884,3.7013,1.4588,0.0841,3.3298,6.27,3.4647,2.5624,5.3373,2.7414,3.4992,5.2501,4.2624,4.4668,5.4994,1.5396,4.1075,2.1233,0.3538,1.4526,3.7138,1.0669,5.4865,4.6348,4.0801,4.9354,4.3696,3.4217,5.1923,0.0012,4.1631,1.2746,0.3552,4.5558,0.3683,1.3751,1.3624,5.9302,0.6938,2.1235,3.061,0.7187,3.119,1.028,3.4032,0.7745,0.0659,2.3555,4.0143,4.7135,1.525,0.0011,1.5722,4.2056,0.7957,0.7409,3.0908,0.5061]}

James Rolfe (R-Fla.), one of the House's leading Republicans, called Monday for a probe of the sale of a Russian cyber firm to the firm, which was set up in 2012.

No arrests have yet been made.","token_len":398,"entropy":[11.7889,2.2435,5.5064,3.2388,1.2258,4.5899,5.8778,0.4991,1.1442,2.9863,0.7281,2.9852,3.1534,10.5641,0.346,4.4764,1.9599,2.2967,0.1373,7.2184,3.5127,0.2397,0.0104,1.3806,5.4829,2.6507,1.5442,2.4002,1.2744,8.6543,2.3883,0.6062,0.3768,0.4632,1.4191,2.3884,6.8166,0.8137,0.3333,2.363,4.5826,3.8561,4.5532,1.449,0.9581,0.1499,3.2395,2.2026,0.6014,2.5522,0.4243,1.9087,3.5072,2.0655,1.074,1.7203,2.6329,3.2048,3.283,2.7811,3.0727,0.0065,0.3086,0.5277,2.752,0.2795,0.3839,1.3844,0.0005,2.7132,4.967,3.5597,1.0255,5.7928,0.0008,4.5966,2.3812,2.8297,1.3051,2.3885,0.8433,3.4507,0.0235,0.1062,0.2665,5.2316,5.5645,1.2713,1.5046,1.0594,4.9278,1.2952,1.1443,1.6527,0.199,2.7433,2.3865,1.6638,1.9285,2.0952,3.5983,2.3622,3.5364,1.2572,3.7878,2.1224,1.4076,2.4806,4.705,2.0552,1.5043,1.6377,1.5115,0.8133,1.669,5.7163,0.431,3.6504,5.5373,3.0137,2.7362,3.3031,0.106,1.3995,1.1133,1.05,0.9662,1.4814,0.7982,0.6698,0.1431,0.4237,0.0002,5.0937,1.4613,4.3745,3.4717,2.3953,0.0749,3.7999,2.1432,1.7552,2.283,0.638,0.704,4.2833,0.013,0.2563,4.1903,0.0903,0.59,2.3385,2.0631,3.4614,1.4114,1.3793,1.371,1.4038,4.7301,0.0219,1.3805,0.7712,4.9473,0.5252,1.8818,4.3578,0.0009,1.3828,2.0494,1.2233,2.9147,0.0359,1.2336,1.669,0.3563,0.1881,0.7646,0.0002,5.6282,4.7124,1.5312,0.0887,3.2961,1.4224,0.041,1.8774,0.7185,3.1897,5.3694,6.5566,0.6171,2.8765,1.8863,0.9207,1.0372,0.8929,0.2916,0.1408,4.6293,2.2482,1.3764,1.3295,2.5428,0.0201,1.705,4.8454,2.5873,2.2811,1.2047,4.288,0.0276,6.8172,0.074,0.6251,3.9807,0.0674,0.2072,1.2877,2.4303,5.0558,3.1205,0.2778,2.119,3.6658,0.705,1.2683,4.6915,0.0211,0.5319,2.8107,1.4945,1.4401,4.0008,1.399,3.3911,2.6379,3.85,0.9531,2.3217,0.2017,0.5451,0.0002,1.7608,3.1858,2.3762,1.3307,3.5003,3.1629,0.4462,0.6504,1.3703,2.5426,1.1604,2.2085,2.2755,3.6953,0.4191,0.3719,0.0064,1.4182,2.0704,4.6916,0.6526,2.3807,0.3652,0.1067,0.2992,0.9102,0.0002,4.6992,5.3964,0.0504,2.4992,1.1208,0.7347,4.8691,1.3787,1.4024,0.1703,0.2135,1.2956,1.4348,2.5415,0.7947,0.1944,0.9716,1.6715,4.8021,5.2601,4.5507,4.4043,5.9547,1.0488,2.0288,1.8094,5.697,0.3932,0.5335,0.0003,2.8055,6.2505,1.8928,0.5026,0.0046,0.0001,4.1055,4.6011,2.8694,0.4223,1.7682,2.6696,5.2766,6.0622,5.8816,2.5849,2.0454,2.9372,5.7861,0.005,3.2175,4.2824,2.4708,1.8528,2.7684,2.4475,5.3127,2.9685,0.0848,1.7819,4.1779,3.3814,0.3361,2.6731,5.2025,0.0024,0.079,4.9347,1.3405,2.3398,2.2728,1.2222,2.4769,1.664,4.5907,3.285,0.677,3.9057,1.0032,1.2161,3.6144,1.5284,0.2593,4.0545,4.979,1.5207,1.2829,5.1151,1.8036,2.6504,4.1676,4.9168,3.3695,2.2902,1.9829,2.9917,4.1991,6.2328,6.1205,0.5866,0.118,1.5173,2.1895,2.6121,0.9294,4.1638,2.3042,0.1345,0.2423,0.0002,3.8972,5.8161,2.1483,2.7541,3.6961,4.2117,0.4954,4.1589,1.6954,0.089,2.232,5.0455,2.2141,0.1732,2.5846,0.0049,0.0327,0.7939]}

King Michael of Romania withdrew from military service in 1986 in the wake of anti-corruption charges that he fled to Switzerland because of serious health challenges. King Michael also resigned from the Dutch Defence Force in 2007 in the wake of a scandal that could have cost him hundreds of thousands of pounds.He said of his country after coming to power of Romania. \"I will not give up fighting, I will fight for Romania and for Romania for my country and for Romania for my country. The people of Romania will not accept that.\"On Tuesday Archbishop of Canterbury Benedict Kuyper made a statement in which he said, with reference to the fact that King Michael may have died because of cancer. Bishop Kuyper said he was afraid the king would come into public life with little hope that he would survive but that he would work for it and that he would be happy with his people and not in a dark place.\"What's going on, he said during the prayer, if you want good news, good news is this: we need good news.\"Benedict asked King Michael to withdraw from service after the scandal broke, although Kuyper said he hadn't been asked to withdraw because the matter came to him, which was already public in the United Kingdom.The Pope is expected to visit Romania shortly, where he was born, and visit civil rights movements in the country.\"I always had a desire to visit Romania, even at the moment. As long as Romania is a stable democracy, it will always be a stable country, because of our constitution,\" he said.Kuyper went on to say that the Pope will continue to speak in Romania and said that King Michael did his duty by returning to his countries in the hope that people in Romania would accept that.He is planning to remain faithful in Romania until June next year.","token_len":398,"entropy":[6.8072,9.599,9.9132,6.0426,7.7487,5.7046,1.1322,9.8192,4.0435,0.3733,0.1515,0.004,4.127,2.2111,4.7659,1.1729,2.8087,6.7566,6.2763,4.6595,5.4146,1.7002,10.6473,3.6826,7.8502,6.7948,0.365,0.0633,3.8828,1.7053,0.2799,6.5713,0.0721,4.9142,1.9471,8.3872,0.6187,6.0392,0.1807,1.452,4.7101,4.6521,2.6977,0.5539,0.0014,5.8998,0.0023,2.9409,2.6904,2.7977,1.3925,5.0678,0.9296,1.4906,4.782,0.469,6.263,2.2885,6.6526,0.3697,5.1732,0.0529,3.6459,3.5813,0.4393,0.8832,5.5233,3.2295,0.992,1.0652,4.0041,3.8502,2.2364,0.1165,0.0015,2.3176,1.9299,1.7545,5.3556,0.852,1.4126,0.7197,4.8907,0.0167,0.4574,0.0383,1.6166,0.5018,8.3543,3.6214,5.4287,1.1051,3.79,6.811,5.5071,0.299,0.7042,5.364,0.5876,4.3627,0.3469,0.9688,3.1117,1.9271,3.6339,0.2451,4.44,3.188,0.8889,0.3372,1.3085,1.0714,2.2519,1.9608,1.3379,2.575,3.3747,2.4985,0.6026,2.1272,0.6884,0.5964,0.6424,1.0965,0.6381,1.639,3.3309,2.2186,0.5708,0.0717,2.08,2.2061,2.7848,2.1987,2.8175,4.56,1.2995,7.0974,2.0335,3.5498,3.1952,6.3353,4.7024,0.7446,4.9263,0.9325,1.3221,1.9599,0.6304,0.0298,1.0836,3.1765,5.7747,1.6765,0.0015,1.0138,5.4881,0.1043,2.4466,0.0305,5.4993,0.705,1.9969,4.272,0.1585,3.6942,2.6594,5.7185,0.5531,0.0107,0.0003,0.905,2.5797,1.7115,5.6238,3.0603,3.3344,1.7884,4.4237,3.5944,4.2663,0.5749,4.0217,6.2995,3.5598,2.4558,0.9102,0.3736,3.4268,5.0584,1.2362,0.8274,1.4526,4.7575,2.0579,3.184,2.0748,1.6935,0.8655,0.6497,3.0915,4.1404,2.8017,1.7505,4.3234,2.2338,3.2815,3.8735,2.4045,6.1686,1.5104,1.2754,4.7681,3.7333,2.9444,0.4306,3.6853,4.06,0.6016,7.648,1.4001,5.2617,1.6964,5.6373,2.2083,2.9113,7.523,2.5783,1.1819,3.2048,0.3236,3.1683,4.6966,1.4888,2.9985,3.8708,2.7301,0.2891,3.6426,3.8411,1.076,0.011,5.7147,4.2559,0.0103,1.0992,4.9966,0.4578,4.4164,3.6404,1.6895,1.3179,1.629,2.0748,4.8984,4.4678,0.0006,0.0006,0.9904,1.2429,6.2617,0.0007,2.4429,2.5001,0.6181,3.5168,3.2406,2.1207,3.8886,4.7276,1.3361,1.9136,4.3523,3.8071,1.8418,5.4575,4.7064,3.1968,1.2885,4.2887,0.8758,0.681,2.5638,3.5004,3.4338,2.0197,0.1333,2.5082,0.8864,4.5364,2.0305,2.8521,0.6347,3.2507,3.3309,1.8588,1.9744,4.9391,6.1511,3.284,6.1734,1.2263,1.3235,0.5977,3.1823,1.6719,5.8859,3.9267,1.1813,3.4638,0.2688,2.2465,0.2704,1.4339,4.3425,4.0467,0.7919,2.8413,2.6273,4.6253,3.4607,0.0499,2.209,0.9285,2.1427,4.85,2.4743,0.5407,2.6288,1.7238,2.9601,0.5223,1.2106,0.6219,1.2348,2.0203,3.255,3.2416,3.0999,4.4119,1.3594,1.2173,0.2322,0.4933,2.8275,0.0044,0.0006,5.3125,0.0521,0.1853,0.5421,0.474,1.7573,1.9993,3.4559,4.0038,0.3133,3.2224,3.4211,1.2054,1.9212,3.5708,1.125,4.0913,0.009,5.0055,4.521,1.4189,2.6031,3.928,0.4292,1.5662,5.4,3.1162,1.5432,3.1401,0.4257,4.5865,1.7963,0.5482,0.5123,2.1812,2.2708,1.5816,2.7622,5.1834,5.6983,0.4142,5.9959,5.591,1.7535,0.6209,1.8384,4.6671,4.4486,0.03,1.2648]}

McCain (is not) here,\" Toomey said in a statement. \"I do, however, agree with the majority of Republicans that we must ensure the country's ability to function properly in the international marketplace and provide for the people of the United States of America.\"\n\nIn response to a reporter's question as to whether he thought the House GOP had done its best to support Republicans, Toomey said, \"I think we did \u2026 we did, and I think the Congress is right to continue our work in passing this measure.\"\n\nTrump is expected to take the first step in the president-elect's presidency when he signs a tax bill, something House Republican leaders are anxious to avoid.","token_len":399,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6722,4.9709,3.8542,2.0527,8.8782,8.7295,2.3362,1.1427,1.1504,4.8507,0.6038,1.2787,3.2515,1.6466,0.8259,3.9607,8.5934,0.3066,4.1306,0.8489,0.0064,15.8749,6.6733,8.5512,5.479,0.833,5.5016,7.1465,1.2188,1.2641,0.5625,1.7388,0.0281,4.4777,5.5688,4.495,0.1194,0.1511,0.3863,0.0002,3.7436,3.768,1.9237,4.9424,4.2954,1.3254,1.6518,4.3673,0.2977,1.4213,3.8526,0.0143,0.0933,6.278,2.0832,1.6062,0.9511,0.6624,4.0157,4.0292,1.7802,5.0434,4.4651,0.5303,6.1953,0.8753,1.4112,0.7282,2.2459,2.4993,3.5179,3.3554,0.0015,2.0315,5.1451,2.9018,0.0945,6.4929,0.543,0.3088,0.0002,5.6046,4.6219,0.2915,3.9753,1.8416,5.6426,3.1086,4.9708,0.6959,0.7499,5.3264,3.0419,1.6262,5.0538,5.1419,2.5455,1.5343,2.3828,3.9877,0.7464,1.2068,0.1035,1.4583,2.6636,2.2621,0.5434,2.39,1.4011,0.721,0.5398,0.869,0.8884,2.2837,6.308,0.809,0.3508,0.0002,5.7111,0.0442,1.7948,4.0983,1.3018,3.0423,4.0145,7.2634,0.0137,0.2582,1.911,0.2128,0.5234,1.8595,2.4774,4.2282,5.2848,1.2319,4.3492,5.5693,2.6845,1.0534,0.0021,2.0928,0.4555,1.3304,0.067,0.0541,0.0314,0.0001,0.1167,0.3438,3.7014,4.6245,4.5854,1.6909,4.5375,5.3377,5.3368,0.3053,1.8841,0.0179,2.8036,4.496,0.0626,4.2794,0.201,5.401,3.4398,3.0531,4.7968,5.7902,5.0142,2.1402,4.0543,4.9953,2.8579,4.7238,2.8687,4.0852,0.6782,0.0659,0.0001,2.0604,0.001,2.5922,3.0845,1.3773,3.2408,5.4938,3.1518,2.4722,1.402,2.7549,3.2478,2.226,1.6969,1.4937,1.3319,2.5514,3.6122,4.8139,0.5032,1.4036,0.3762,0.5748,5.7602,0.6168,5.9423,0.0018,5.2392,0.2767,0.0002,0.0001,0.0721,0.0101,0.003,0.004,1.2126,4.7414,0.2959,0.4021,0.0425,1.8216,0.0635,0.103,0.7218,1.6262,5.9006,0.6559,1.4972,5.1036,4.6679,0.8342,0.0031,1.2797,3.5803,3.3538,0.074,4.9948,4.0377,0.4137,0.8622,5.1046,2.7572,1.549,0.1013,0.0001,1.1618,1.8807,2.4587,2.6921,0.9882,3.9403,0.0025,0.659,4.4644,2.7933,3.3261,0.6791,4.0674,2.3866,0.2228,0.0002,0.0005,0.2456,1.7089,0.2977,0.1686,0.3532,0.308,2.1606,4.1025,4.9549,0.0197,0.0173,2.236,0.2993,1.7818,3.2449,0.8303,2.9819,1.96,2.5496,1.6163,4.4962,2.1357,4.3089,1.074,3.2338,0.0215,4.657,2.3805,2.2896,1.0231,3.4565,2.4712,2.1174,4.9027,1.4436,1.1068,3.5572,0.5972,0.7388,0.2089,0.0027,2.5308,0.0018,0.9015,0.0574,0.0001,4.0875,4.2939,0.4525,2.5018,3.3266,0.06,0.2232,4.5412,0.0671,0.5244,1.7417,2.4546,0.87,4.1111,3.2774,3.3638,3.2906,1.8616,4.0088,0.4089,5.0505,6.2643,2.3166,0.6002,0.0001,0.0008,0.4438,1.2893,0.0257,0.9049,1.2195,1.9057,1.9532,6.3692,2.5889,1.9293,3.8995,1.4615,1.6681,0.613,2.2263,5.5531,2.6609,4.6988,0.7225,4.77,4.1132,0.5513,3.0375,3.9759,1.3045,3.9625,0.6064,0.0852,0.0002,4.5917,3.5482,0.9327,0.0206,4.7456,1.7545,3.9198,1.4419,1.9489,2.8784,4.556,1.5015,0.0147,0.0234,4.0767,4.0192,0.2768,1.2254,1.4651,1.1497,2.4146,3.0035,5.5595,3.4492,3.0796,0.1752,2.0937,5.3388,0.354,1.5094,1.1504]}
{"id":2809,"ended":true,"length":379,"gen_text":"South Sudan s government and rebel groups signed a ceasefire on Thursday in the latest attempt to end a four-year civil war and allow humanitarian groups access to civilians caught in the fighting. The truce would allow rebel groups in the south to move their fighters into the country to support their own people. In return for their fighters agreeing to allow humanitarian aid to continue, the United States has agreed to allow humanitarian aid into besieged West Darfur.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sudanese forces seized control of the city of Deen and the northern Anbar province, where at least 22 people were killed Thursday, but no significant military forces have been taken back. The government said the army is not backing up its military campaign and would wait for reinforcements before continuing. A week into the fighting with an Islamist insurgency, Islamists in Darfur have made gains by attacking military checkpoints and the airport.\n\nIn the past month, Darfur has witnessed the worst violence in its recent history, when the army, backed by the United States, has pushed back, and there has been no dramatic change in fighting levels. Meanwhile, some of the key rebel leaders in Deen have stepped up attacks in recent days in which they say they attacked government forces in a bid to stop the country's government from gaining ground.\n\nBut they insist the fighting has gone on to give the government some time to respond to the influx of rebels, many now living in neighboring areas, and ensure their security against military advances. The truce signed on Thursday is the first time a government has agreed to allow aid in so-called humanitarian corridors.\n\nThere has recently been a rising tide of humanitarian assistance to many countries, and most countries have taken steps to restrict the humanitarian aid they give, including offering smaller aid packages to aid groups on the ground in areas they say are besieged. This is expected to further erode support for the humanitarian flow in South Sudan, where many of the country's most violent conflict has raged for more than a decade.","token_len":399,"entropy":[10.3598,8.5285,7.2376,3.5543,4.8544,0.9703,7.173,0.4955,1.7452,2.8047,2.984,3.0595,1.2052,6.4692,3.655,0.1933,1.1182,1.4054,3.1222,0.0181,0.2925,1.1653,0.0196,3.5811,4.2362,3.7507,3.5303,3.5935,0.0754,6.0098,6.378,1.0718,0.7066,1.87,0.3146,2.9713,1.8566,5.2164,1.7537,3.7868,0.4737,4.2187,1.0693,2.0869,0.48,3.3257,2.7604,1.7427,1.9272,1.7629,3.4038,2.5873,4.3287,1.7441,3.4001,4.4178,0.8327,4.7812,3.6538,1.5911,2.9273,5.3316,4.602,0.1002,3.0417,1.3437,1.1184,0.9977,4.0133,0.7429,0.8484,2.831,0.9816,2.3433,1.5221,0.1163,2.1585,2.2831,1.0217,3.5042,4.633,6.256,5.3884,0.0094,1.2193,1.3069,0.0007,3.5755,1.7801,0.2926,2.5705,1.24,2.3234,3.3259,2.7008,0.0317,1.3074,2.6413,0.0635,4.9218,4.3903,2.5143,2.3148,3.5954,5.5846,0.5506,0.1742,1.0633,2.8478,5.1572,0.0007,4.7659,0.6231,0.9825,0.0624,6.8986,1.507,4.3038,4.158,4.664,3.3261,4.6696,1.0398,0.2911,3.673,3.3028,0.5976,1.8248,1.9455,2.4703,1.9259,2.4448,3.5161,3.6289,4.5639,3.3217,1.041,3.1293,2.939,2.5413,4.1554,4.7172,0.6092,3.632,1.6061,3.9833,1.0128,4.2314,5.1782,4.746,0.3673,2.9043,6.5815,4.261,4.6263,1.7186,1.3613,5.8755,2.3959,3.2917,0.0003,0.9107,4.6073,0.9125,5.6189,3.4026,4.768,1.6201,0.8223,3.9893,5.1774,1.2534,0.7075,0.0002,2.9129,1.5429,2.7811,3.0847,0.1839,3.6821,0.0025,0.5251,2.4946,2.6495,2.0195,1.3431,0.7647,2.7534,5.4636,0.4541,1.206,3.6305,3.1769,3.4783,2.8481,0.6371,0.0536,1.7292,0.717,0.4483,0.4675,2.0078,3.6571,1.9668,4.996,2.4751,5.1208,1.0617,0.076,1.8891,5.797,2.3837,0.1993,2.6095,3.8088,0.825,5.246,0.053,4.5631,2.8239,0.2272,5.91,1.3125,2.7335,1.6989,3.8462,0.002,1.2275,5.0335,1.1721,3.051,2.8406,1.3384,0.7741,3.0022,4.5013,0.6932,2.7256,0.5998,5.9042,1.7059,0.9264,2.4545,2.7528,0.7736,0.0032,2.7352,0.917,5.6509,0.3111,2.2816,0.3879,3.5996,2.4747,0.4755,0.5124,0.0002,4.774,5.1664,5.2066,1.6766,2.5648,1.8588,4.0464,0.4465,4.468,4.4774,1.2693,1.6367,3.9258,2.4338,0.0211,3.5357,1.2616,0.9188,5.0684,0.0191,5.4429,2.1568,3.5299,6.901,3.1264,0.341,4.0278,4.1766,1.5023,1.1323,6.0541,3.3272,3.0966,4.8967,5.399,2.7017,0.2425,2.5793,4.8542,4.6015,1.622,0.2736,2.2573,1.6425,0.8754,1.7121,2.7142,2.1504,1.6382,1.733,0.0674,0.9277,2.1471,3.3145,4.7984,2.1088,0.0012,2.4933,0.939,1.4404,0.797,0.0002,5.4567,1.8581,6.6896,0.0129,1.1922,5.4386,1.7139,0.0303,4.2357,3.741,1.9211,5.7336,3.8623,1.4757,2.8941,4.9439,3.2593,1.1666,3.4898,0.9557,0.0936,5.1024,1.3838,4.7808,2.5867,1.5565,4.0851,3.0865,1.7363,5.0348,5.3775,2.8042,0.2648,1.0442,2.6481,0.945,5.2875,0.7066,0.299,2.5173,2.7422,2.5172,3.0906,0.6317,2.8234,0.5225,4.6855,2.5436,3.8705,0.0092,3.2911,4.8546,0.0003,2.4486,0.1318,0.5974,4.5593,5.8982,1.79,4.6047,0.0047,0.884,1.1861,3.2901,1.1814,0.3031,2.4827,0.0005,1.4628,5.2803,2.5615,1.1438,1.7274,0.3689,1.1756,0.0054,1.0427,0.5541,0.1341]}

That law prevents buying ammunition or training for rifles and will only be lifted once the federal government has ratified a $5.5 billion package for training the public on how to use firearms and their attachments in the US.\n\nTopics: government-and-politics, federal-government, federal---state-issues, federal-parliament, australia\n\nFirst posted","token_len":399,"entropy":[8.6096,0.0267,2.5055,0.0025,2.5548,2.4328,2.1061,4.2506,0.4889,11.9081,11.4356,2.7543,3.1735,1.2427,1.107,1.8904,4.9659,2.5513,9.8206,6.8852,0.6157,0.0017,4.7876,1.9074,4.023,5.5575,0.0282,7.24,1.9579,7.8893,0.6907,1.3135,0.1998,3.9405,6.652,2.2844,0.0909,4.7647,2.4005,0.4793,2.3732,2.5176,3.8697,0.5327,4.9056,0.8705,0.1846,0.0004,1.1269,2.7288,0.6858,3.9848,4.6499,7.2875,1.3195,0.5273,1.4692,2.0216,2.8287,3.637,0.1982,4.8674,2.7005,0.7751,5.3865,4.647,0.2808,1.0712,3.4644,2.5475,2.4948,1.5539,2.1759,0.6172,4.4156,2.1903,0.5793,1.4331,0.6956,4.4403,1.6492,3.0314,0.5121,3.4077,1.8235,0.4713,0.2151,0.0003,6.249,1.8804,5.023,1.9431,0.6812,0.7586,3.1572,0.5426,0.0656,3.1879,4.2438,3.3624,0.5208,5.843,2.9425,5.1147,1.0267,4.1501,2.3537,3.8481,1.1326,4.0563,2.0317,2.0024,0.7978,3.6613,0.513,0.9232,0.6289,1.4956,5.2717,1.3474,2.3071,4.291,2.3805,5.4347,3.3928,1.6636,1.9587,1.6305,0.6638,0.1482,0.0003,4.0489,0.0756,2.6325,2.2145,2.7942,4.2359,0.0153,2.7104,0.8048,0.2481,3.3636,3.5064,1.8355,4.9899,0.3567,2.3389,2.79,4.015,2.203,4.639,5.2522,0.4164,1.0112,3.6936,2.9174,0.4762,6.7304,4.8931,3.1537,1.9501,3.0592,5.5411,1.1969,4.3018,1.1819,6.0191,2.8283,1.6911,0.1159,0.0002,4.9571,4.0218,4.3552,4.9464,1.3378,1.4725,0.9017,5.0302,4.6077,0.3224,1.5047,0.0263,1.836,4.7466,2.9499,0.4505,1.7046,4.5667,0.5323,2.476,0.7233,4.2735,3.1502,2.395,2.4441,2.5021,3.6526,3.3558,1.9049,5.9604,3.0459,1.2789,0.1651,0.0002,0.6953,1.9871,4.9966,3.1596,1.4998,0.9486,3.3865,4.617,3.7543,2.65,4.2212,1.902,5.1998,0.1991,6.7735,2.1173,3.3901,3.7169,2.2719,0.0386,5.8837,0.4922,2.1608,1.9863,1.436,0.0024,0.9644,1.7777,1.7896,5.0185,0.773,0.1918,0.0002,5.5802,1.7612,4.8163,1.0123,2.7673,5.1079,4.0139,1.6649,2.5084,0.2494,1.5389,4.9245,0.5913,1.3928,2.8142,1.6273,1.2112,2.2697,0.017,0.2027,4.7209,1.1347,3.3221,4.5875,5.5332,6.3564,1.4498,4.8809,0.1086,5.7181,6.3563,0.7505,2.8921,2.0604,0.9649,0.8101,3.351,4.5308,3.9271,2.4072,2.636,1.9034,5.2002,0.0537,5.4288,2.0461,4.3358,4.3735,2.4388,5.0939,2.063,2.3207,3.5036,0.4662,0.1944,0.0003,3.8587,1.9954,2.7701,1.3815,3.7991,1.1402,3.0481,0.9354,3.5989,5.1166,0.1344,1.2864,2.4336,1.2436,4.0238,3.839,0.2364,1.068,4.6506,6.6808,1.6919,0.2481,1.641,5.8862,4.8653,6.7689,4.9872,3.9498,1.0942,5.8475,5.2701,4.6834,5.5729,3.0551,1.6862,0.0596,1.2948,5.5596,1.4718,8.2856,3.1571,0.9943,2.2771,2.7481,0.9878,2.0687,0.6418,1.971,5.0069,1.8216,4.0215,3.0445,0.793,1.2841,0.0929,3.0781,2.63,3.8306,2.9481,2.4295,1.1065,1.5664,0.0398,1.3233,0.8968,3.33,4.708,3.9412,3.6156,1.9524,5.421,0.2825,0.234,0.0003,2.866,0.0001,1.5759,0.0025,0.0,0.0007,0.0,0.0006,0.3479,0.0236,0.1565,0.0089,0.915,2.9491,0.0304,0.0056,0.0005,0.0203,1.1531,0.2339,0.4205,0.0,0.0141,1.7069,0.0,0.0023,0.3017,0.0002,0.0001,0.0001]}

In the document, the finance ministry will decide in its current way whether or not to bring the country to a free-trade agreement with the U.S., or to scrap the terms for the deal in exchange for lower rates.\n\nThe new U.S. law has pushed U.S. manufacturing jobs and businesses aside from the Japanese government since the nation sought to reduce carbon emissions during the recession. However, it has also resulted in the U.S. being one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gas emissions and the largest producer of raw materials on Earth. It has also fueled the expansion of Japan's export-oriented industrial sector which is forecast to reach nearly 40 percent of GDP within 2025.\n\n\"The U.S. tax reform reflects deep U.S. interests, especially the competitiveness, competitiveness and value-added-added [PRA].\"\n\nBut it also has taken a toll on Japanese living standards during the global slump. Japan's GDP growth declined by 7 percent in 2015 from 0.1 percent in 2011 to 0.8 percent in 2014, after the recession hit.\n\n\"The Japanese economy has already started to mature again,\" said Masayoshi Kitamura, head of international relations at the World Economic Forum.\n\nThe \"shock wave\" caused by the international financial crisis triggered by the Fukushima nuclear power plant's March 2011 collapse has spurred a recovery. In 2015, the total economy grew by 14 percent over the prior year, and 1.2 percent in 2016, according to consultancy research firm Credit Suisse. Japan, China and the United States account for 14 percent of the world's economic activity, but both are at the top of the list of industrialized nations with greenhouse gases emissions of more than three degrees Celsius (17.8 degrees Fahrenheit) below 1990 levels.","token_len":399,"entropy":[11.2233,8.2232,8.3945,13.8833,3.0715,5.4431,6.778,3.0309,1.6301,4.4672,6.893,2.4618,2.1832,4.1565,0.0282,1.0671,5.824,0.0607,0.174,0.1065,5.271,2.9116,3.0389,2.3997,0.0031,1.0652,4.5886,3.1203,0.0078,0.7448,3.0899,1.8683,0.1229,5.3952,1.6061,1.697,0.1153,1.0099,1.9337,0.0598,1.6309,3.5861,4.2486,3.8843,4.8168,4.7675,0.7682,3.1931,0.0023,0.2125,5.0655,2.4326,3.4592,2.3739,1.4222,5.5629,0.7011,0.5596,0.1825,0.4799,0.3148,1.2399,0.0004,0.0057,1.0286,2.8714,1.267,5.2971,0.8346,5.7362,3.9255,1.8494,2.3455,3.491,2.4618,0.0062,3.0947,1.4285,0.6936,0.7613,0.0003,1.4746,4.2018,3.6469,0.0014,0.0078,0.0627,4.4844,3.9517,5.5514,2.5132,0.0003,0.0068,0.1613,5.0721,2.5072,3.0168,4.9844,6.2487,0.9959,2.0895,5.5287,3.8696,4.2449,1.6527,5.4375,6.0217,0.5503,3.5809,6.4718,0.2102,3.81,0.3905,2.3198,0.652,4.263,0.014,2.6873,0.8161,1.1142,5.0851,0.0029,2.9274,2.5566,0.0004,0.004,0.0543,3.3504,2.6646,0.0067,0.248,2.9967,1.3744,0.0027,0.0854,0.2598,1.4653,0.187,3.1828,2.8163,2.2506,2.7884,0.0311,5.4818,0.209,5.7664,1.0363,0.4238,4.5972,1.575,0.8728,4.9419,1.9069,4.9697,0.0494,4.443,0.056,3.4694,1.7866,1.1145,4.3026,1.125,4.4457,1.9615,5.207,0.0282,3.6483,3.5747,3.5966,0.7307,0.2136,2.6684,4.3279,6.1766,0.4986,0.2522,0.0002,2.2501,1.4504,1.5631,0.0006,0.0011,0.0598,2.7378,0.6666,5.4018,6.0279,3.6601,0.002,0.0016,0.1747,4.3379,1.8046,4.0043,2.9066,4.8802,3.9378,2.3532,1.0418,4.5942,1.8484,0.0105,4.1871,0.6068,4.4149,4.4068,7.5999,6.0877,1.0109,0.0002,4.1214,3.2828,1.1156,2.5756,5.5785,1.6723,2.3799,0.0497,3.1153,5.4176,0.0598,6.7677,0.4263,4.907,5.2139,1.1768,3.4383,0.9416,2.9024,2.4395,4.0939,1.2916,3.4591,1.508,0.9565,2.1657,2.1531,5.4739,0.0015,3.0027,0.0253,0.3484,3.0273,2.5444,0.5075,0.0003,2.5755,0.008,0.1574,1.2941,0.7971,4.9107,1.8836,3.0985,1.8109,0.8143,1.0597,0.0002,2.0251,1.0364,3.7418,1.0867,1.6013,4.6105,4.719,0.2126,5.661,2.1776,2.0875,0.7104,3.3492,1.4062,0.322,5.3436,1.3707,0.0819,2.1857,0.009,5.0457,3.0451,0.5834,1.4564,3.8352,2.6785,0.0059,1.3922,1.4922,0.0002,1.9245,5.7609,5.5885,4.2953,0.1155,3.7207,0.2253,0.307,6.1168,1.5023,0.0987,4.6795,0.9849,0.4921,2.7503,0.5387,2.9154,0.0683,4.704,5.5433,0.4429,2.2851,1.3698,5.743,2.1678,4.8296,3.3344,3.2638,2.6613,0.138,1.2151,4.8378,3.4228,0.4373,0.4031,5.0228,0.8195,4.4034,0.4183,4.7995,0.6248,0.7074,2.2151,5.3679,0.188,2.0503,1.5152,1.1927,0.6888,1.0981,0.9447,0.0029,5.9813,3.654,0.3353,5.0551,0.0495,0.0,0.1771,3.7,4.5009,5.063,0.41,0.8157,1.3832,0.0576,3.2183,0.0043,4.9891,0.1331,0.2159,0.9171,1.064,0.1796,3.3294,2.5655,1.2173,2.3185,4.8547,1.7387,4.0817,1.9076,2.291,0.0658,0.5232,1.1411,0.7072,3.9959,0.7439,1.7069,5.6802,2.0719,2.2181,3.0699,0.7424,0.0025,3.9313,4.7245,0.423,1.3926,5.9819,0.6535,2.365,0.206,0.0051,0.853,1.7614,1.9532,0.013,0.1669]}
