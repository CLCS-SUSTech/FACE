At his trial in the church, Dr. Kiyoko asks if the boy actually lost a tooth. The boy refuses to give up but ends up with another tooth after he is tested for HIV.\n\n. In the manga, the man named Akira, a fellow priest, has a special power. However, it is unknown how this happens. In the final version, it is revealed that Akira is possessed of powerful magical powers including the ability to see things but is only able to read books, with no knowledge of books or movies whatsoever. In the anime, Akira has also a magic ring that can change his shape into a human skeleton, which he uses to kill several other demons and other demons inside of him. However, after he reaches the level of god, there are a number of side-effects such as being unable to talk with other demons.\n\n. In the dub, when he kills a demon on the way out from the temple where the hero is, it is revealed that his sword was stolen from him. In the manga, the sword is instead kept by the protagonist. The anime will show him in the temple, only then will he discover that his sword is just an artifact used to cut through human flesh.\n\nHe is seen again during a final fight in the film, when Goku manages to destroy the Great Barrier God that destroyed the planet, and destroys many different demons due to he-goes-fierce-to-win, then uses his sword to end the war on the planet, as well as his own sword to defeat the enemies.

Although, it was revealed in the comic that the god of the planet Saturn is known as S'angri (S'angri is the original name of Saturn) and he is said to be a goddess born of one of the first known stars in the universe, his wife being S'angri, and S'angri is said to have three sons of Saturn. Saturn is believed to be God, although this is not the case for the main character in the film.\n\nIf the character does not start from 0% there would be a warning of death, but he could still have the power to take a very large amount of power away from the viewer.\n\nWhen the audience was shown a portion of the final scene, \"The Legend of T'ohru\" was played. This is the only time the entire episode has no scene where T'ohru is mentioned.\n\nReferences","token_len":600,"entropy":[10.6257,1.7616,6.2102,7.9305,8.4879,2.5629,0.1662,1.5845,0.5324,4.9174,0.0761,5.7597,0.6424,10.8659,1.9042,2.0574,0.0072,9.1269,3.8918,0.2602,0.004,0.0005,0.0016,0.001,0.0011,0.0227,0.0006,0.0017,0.0011,0.0063,0.0008,5.3813,5.2161,3.5603,3.495,1.3221,5.582,0.5296,5.2916,0.0683,4.8263,4.5443,2.2872,4.5378,3.2171,1.8415,4.4476,5.9176,5.4033,3.5415,3.077,0.999,1.8112,0.7549,3.8526,0.8414,2.7089,0.8313,4.2262,5.4152,0.0401,3.8303,4.8897,0.3338,4.4767,2.4449,2.5685,5.589,1.956,5.1397,0.451,0.7269,0.0002,7.4689,3.2267,1.011,2.6926,0.3606,1.5576,5.8771,3.2856,5.7312,3.2222,2.6382,5.6396,3.7569,0.7308,3.3996,1.3385,4.6823,3.7801,3.1437,4.5578,0.0586,2.0622,0.7858,1.5911,2.0492,1.6054,4.7563,0.6244,2.1272,0.5033,4.9003,3.5262,0.744,2.5635,0.5261,1.023,0.1908,1.6238,1.5602,4.9793,3.7199,6.0125,2.9341,0.5514,6.3278,1.6086,0.441,0.0102,2.9226,4.3881,6.2644,2.9888,4.0245,0.9752,0.0107,4.2813,4.3928,2.6564,5.4704,1.7975,2.14,0.1531,4.0849,2.4595,4.8934,5.8055,0.1184,2.5348,0.3877,1.1798,0.2789,1.9136,2.7203,3.557,3.4993,4.2048,4.0496,1.3352,1.873,3.3763,1.1837,4.4312,2.7766,0.7203,2.3958,4.9687,1.7919,1.9868,1.4901,1.2679,0.3087,3.9869,5.9628,3.1668,2.7173,2.6148,3.201,2.8569,6.0253,1.7857,0.5403,0.2765,3.9795,0.0386,3.8911,1.9119,5.3123,1.1579,3.8223,0.1761,1.9726,1.4159,5.1052,1.5285,3.3784,1.4338,0.0111,5.4467,1.7166,0.3144,3.543,0.0089,2.6088,1.7455,0.0041,3.2502,3.4718,2.4575,2.3542,2.7902,0.8497,0.0002,3.9725,0.6183,0.1175,6.8014,0.3011,3.5959,2.914,5.0388,1.5678,0.7994,4.5828,0.906,2.4336,2.8968,3.5827,0.8423,2.7153,4.6495,1.4841,4.7391,1.0742,1.1905,2.2412,0.97,1.0526,0.1665,2.951,4.5987,1.8106,3.2739,1.3234,0.4881,1.0366,2.4884,0.2304,1.6814,0.1025,1.8158,1.7971,0.9261,5.1642,4.9349,1.4115,1.3495,2.4137,1.5968,3.1566,4.1335,5.4086,1.931,1.8572,3.618,1.2121,2.1927,2.0591,4.7823,5.4084,2.495,0.5087,3.7439,0.5621,1.7553,0.3415,1.0577,5.7872,2.797,1.4474,4.6565,0.7757,3.5503,2.1213,4.3602,0.4629,0.508,0.8268,0.0002,5.1852,1.236,3.269,4.4602,3.0484,2.2865,5.6646,2.2858,2.369,0.5795,5.0387,1.8596,1.8295,5.4234,5.3846,0.0056,3.8803,0.8071,5.7117,2.3876,5.124,4.7432,3.2079,0.9991,3.0372,2.3307,2.0148,4.4325,5.1324,4.9178,3.7987,6.2739,0.0031,6.3559,5.2232,4.3166,0.1294,0.8957,5.3182,4.0426,0.4912,3.7559,0.1999,5.3664,3.1167,4.7504,3.7505,0.8764,2.1153,0.2956,5.3539,0.4783,2.953,3.8944,1.3352,0.7585,1.8775,3.6795,0.8587,0.0341,3.331,1.997,4.5218,1.2277,1.6314,1.0753,5.3789,1.5719,2.1533,2.4418,5.6921,6.2699,2.272,2.5825,3.1976,1.4331,3.3264,4.7137,1.8945,1.6127,2.9227,4.3967,0.3502,1.1204,3.7735,2.6057,0.4182,5.0636,2.0163,3.2507,5.4552,2.0695,1.2005,4.7151,5.9747,3.8649,2.5032,7.29,0.0002,4.6485,0.5218,0.0003,2.4153,0.0528,0.0006,3.1832,0.0002,1.7707,0.2388,0.0005,4.3258,3.3843,1.4436,1.5191,4.79,3.8547,2.6098,0.6349,0.3778,1.5204,0.3388,1.9638,1.618,4.0003,4.7968,6.0179,5.8515,0.8363,6.4025,2.1679,4.6181,0.6691,0.0003,4.696,4.208,4.7031,2.7593,1.9629,2.1253,1.3714,0.5154,4.4412,0.6275,1.6146,6.027,2.1199,1.1209,3.8443,6.4881,1.2725,4.3255,0.4382,3.9828,0.9036,0.0598,0.0084,2.8187,3.1216,0.7278,0.147,0.2225,1.6164,1.0843,6.0498,0.4839,0.789,2.4558,2.6478,1.3909,3.18,1.1444,3.5445,0.0212,0.6944,1.9976,4.7356,5.8663,1.2963,5.6141,0.4822,0.4306,5.2535,4.36,3.6937,1.6491,0.4143,1.08,1.1623,4.6369,4.9286,5.0651,1.3552,0.0584,0.0154,0.0183,2.0991,2.3325,4.657,0.0102,0.0144,0.0126,2.3816,1.5061,0.0147,1.286,5.1698,2.1866,4.6814,2.4023,0.8286,5.3583,1.0557,4.407,0.0489,0.5449,5.8817,3.0822,3.6588,2.308,1.0691,1.4647,2.8426,0.4061,1.7621,1.862,3.7217,0.9495,3.3549,0.4487,3.2364,0.3653,0.5843,0.0002,5.3473,1.0472,2.1938,4.1129,0.2291,5.4592,2.9054,5.9419,4.194,5.3765,3.0365,0.2326,1.2442,5.5701,4.126,2.993,2.4307,2.2864,4.2636,2.687,2.0724,3.2263,3.1856,2.5695,0.999,5.1918,3.0057,5.3965,1.8096,0.6634,0.0068,1.955,3.6718,0.3603,1.0764,3.6425,0.5952,0.6747,0.0002,3.4368,1.3448,5.1514,4.014,2.5661,2.0435,5.7853,0.0162,0.4085,4.4582,1.7586,1.6669,5.7918,2.3045,4.8484,0.1245,4.6757,0.7021,4.3036,2.6004,1.2896,2.0595,3.3342,2.2347,2.1487,1.7237,1.5857,1.1501,0.9902,1.5949,4.4192,3.0395,2.5802,5.6567,3.4056,1.6002,1.7967,0.0092,0.0034,0.0008,0.863,2.5342,0.6831,0.4595,0.0003,4.9954]}
{"id":2687,"ended":true,"length":595,"gen_text":"You're in your favorite part of town and you come across a bar you've never seen before. You enter and, unbeknownst to you, the patrons and bartenders are all ghosts. You 'll come home in disbelief. The bar is on the other side of town. And so you say goodbye.' But the customer never gets to you 'cause that's the only way he could come back into your life. 'Cause after that you're right next door to his desk and say 'I just didn't hear,' and he never leaves. It's like that. And he has no clue who your neighbor or friend is. The person you love has no idea who you're talking to. It's never explained but for some reason you feel completely lost with your relationship with him. There's nothing to know about his life. As a person who has always loved you, you can't believe what you see but it's never told. And that really goes against what your relationship is. 'Cause when it comes to real life, it isn't your life. It's just things you happen to meet through. And that makes you feel alone. I know you don't. It makes you not feel in a good way like anyone else. But it's ok when it happens. It's okay when you've made mistakes and done things that your loved one hasn't (read: never did ). You know your love is there, 'cause we all fall in love once and for all, we're together on a limb. But it doesn't matter because if it never ends as you expect it can never stop. Or it gets better like you imagined at least. The more you're able to make it work the stronger it will become. And that is what really made me so happy when I heard I won't marry any more. That is when all the tears I've had in my life started to fall away and my life took a dramatic leap forward. I just felt that so many people were just so grateful I was going to be happy. There was nobody so grateful with me. I was so thankful for them because that was my dream. That is when suddenly there was a person that needed me to be so happy and I needed to be happy, that was just like getting out. So that is when my heart came alive and I realized my entire life had just been built on one promise and I had to accept that and try to do a better job now. It's kind of hard now to live with that kind of grief because I'm a little sad with who, but I think I would gladly accept it for this life because I feel that I must live. That I must try harder every day because that is so far from how things should be for me. But even when that happens my heart just tells me just to accept that and not make excuses. It just tells me just to accept that for this life I needed to do better now.

{"id":2230,"ended":false,"length":583,"gen_text":"( WP ) Write a boring story that feels like something exciting is about to happen, but never does.\n\nInstead, it makes the whole situation seem like something that can't happen, like something is too big to fail, or too short to be the way it should have been. This makes a lot of sense if you have an easy way to make everything go right without affecting things so much that it actually makes a big difference in how much you get paid for this article.\n\nIf it actually happens, the article makes sense, but it doesn't really have the meaning it deserves. There are a ton of reasons why stories are boring for certain kinds of people. If a person is going to read a pretty shitty story or a post on reddit with a bunch of comments saying that they like it and it makes them like this little piece of shit, why not change them to write about it and talk about what they're like, and make them like it? This has to be a really, really good story.\n\nI wouldn't make this a big deal if it wasn't really good, but for many of us it just feels like this is what happens when we do stuff that is very poorly researched or written based on evidence, instead of writing some research paper, which will show this is exactly what happens.\n\nYou do have to put in a lot of effort to find and research the reasons people dislike things, but the same is true for this stuff. If it can't be done, it can't really be done, but it's a real problem, and it's something that you need to try if necessary.\n\nNow, the worst part about this article, and most of the other I've written on this subject, is that it breaks with the idea that people should simply skip something that they like and just go elsewhere. All that you need to read is that the reason this doesn't work out is because you ignore the fact that it doesn't work. If people actually do like that this is an extremely bad thing, and people actually have something to like, it makes no difference.\n\nWhen we create the article about how they're supposed to see themselves getting paid for this work, even as you're not going to get paid, we're just making the fact that this is absolutely so wrong for people who don't care about this work that we're going to make it better. The point is to take away from this shitty article the reason that this piece of shit is so bad, because it's not what actually happened.\n\nIf you are actually writing something this is pretty bad because it makes so many more people care about it and does so much damage to the whole idea of this site, and we should actually take it off the site and stop supporting shitty, terrible stuff like this one!\n\nWell, if this is true for you, how does that affect you?

{"id":1298,"ended":false,"length":575,"gen_text":"You are an immigrant who just moved to America with your family. It's 4th of July and you have no idea what it is, or that it's celebrated. You are going to see people celebrating the new millennium and everything goes crazy.\n\nThe fact is if you make it to the top of this year's list, everyone that's voted is going to love everything America has done on the front lines for over 100 years.\n\nSo let's make it 4th.\n\nIt is a very good year for American immigrants.\n\nI'll add three things here for your consideration.\n\n1. This year will feature many people who were born here, but have never moved on but for fear of persecution or persecution again with your country's immigration policy. If you have your family member from Iran who was sent here by your parents to the U.S. as an infant but is now returning after a short but traumatic stay here, it may be worth considering your application for citizenship, and there are a number of states which are working on their plans regarding their citizens being able to apply for citizenship. 2. Most immigrants who are here and have a spouse or child should have a good, legal reason to stay here. 2. The immigration system in America is highly competitive, where many people live and work in very different, difficult, and often harsh environments. Your application will be reviewed, and you may be eligible for citizenship without any barriers and at no cost to you or yourself.\n\n3. The immigration law is a complicated and complex system that is hard for you to understand. What are the advantages and disadvantages of different systems and how do you deal with them?\n\nI have no shortage of problems with the system. In fact, I am not the only one with an array of issues that can be overcome in the system.\n\n3. If you are not able to secure an immigrant's status before they move to the United States for permanent residence (I'm a permanent resident of the U.S.) you may be ineligible for permanent residence, meaning you won't be able to work or work in the United States at all, not even until you arrive in the States and register with Citizenship and Immigration Services (which isn't open until after you've completed the 5 year, five month waiting period required by your local department of immigration). There is absolutely no guarantee that your status can be changed, if you don't apply to the immigration system and if you choose to leave the country rather than moving.\n\nThese are, of course, some of the issues that people struggle with most. Many of the major problems are related to the fact that many immigrants are never born in the United States, and the lack of documentation makes it impossible to determine exactly when and how they can stay in the United States.\n\nHere are a few simple steps you can take to help you apply for permanent status.\n\nDo a background check for your application before you apply","token_len":603,"entropy":[3.8828,4.1252,5.686,2.268,5.9139,3.2456,0.8477,3.2242,4.238,1.1337,1.1506,1.2208,3.2181,0.9312,10.1174,5.3105,2.4386,0.0738,1.936,0.9294,2.3753,2.4802,1.2884,0.8316,2.1875,1.5351,3.0773,4.2343,4.7783,1.1017,0.4134,7.7775,1.556,1.9408,2.2424,3.8521,0.1764,3.1354,3.2538,3.4818,2.376,5.0387,5.1324,2.1943,5.1633,5.2125,3.798,0.7837,1.996,0.0008,3.5356,4.0872,1.2778,4.6948,0.3392,5.2137,1.4064,0.8297,0.8754,3.1143,0.9022,2.435,2.327,0.1334,1.3104,0.7487,5.2126,4.7895,2.4277,4.2851,2.416,0.3032,0.0066,4.5641,7.5752,6.956,0.48,3.9951,5.1709,1.279,4.7425,0.8918,3.1635,3.7606,2.0781,0.0468,0.3079,1.3866,0.0002,2.9854,3.0284,0.2631,3.8607,1.0697,4.6864,0.1369,3.3287,0.8104,0.0001,4.3412,2.6123,2.5717,3.7159,3.1371,1.9709,0.7509,3.335,3.2483,0.6402,1.102,0.0002,3.64,4.2046,5.1749,4.5328,2.079,3.3434,4.2436,3.4739,2.5059,0.7291,0.2473,0.0002,0.6006,0.5647,4.389,0.6062,3.8225,5.5342,3.8439,4.59,1.2342,3.4564,1.0131,1.3187,1.949,2.5942,2.0948,1.9874,3.8414,4.7836,5.7238,5.9918,5.0314,0.5161,3.5207,1.6397,2.9103,3.7307,6.7958,3.4439,4.3138,2.1579,2.8974,1.7822,0.2622,4.5684,0.3632,2.5042,4.8713,1.7799,4.9871,3.0688,5.5544,2.2771,2.0956,4.5565,1.0407,2.6033,1.2187,3.0869,2.579,3.8597,1.5456,0.0015,0.0086,0.7321,2.5809,1.9665,2.1654,4.8386,2.3926,0.5219,5.3952,4.5239,2.2111,2.9471,4.4526,3.3562,1.4967,1.4709,0.5607,2.7597,3.4799,0.7143,2.3077,2.2526,3.2075,4.4667,1.043,2.0376,3.355,2.6197,5.2866,0.7445,2.4479,1.3524,0.0326,4.2577,3.666,2.6278,4.6626,1.6347,2.7537,4.6242,6.0584,3.0176,2.384,3.6259,1.636,0.0047,1.841,0.4185,0.2944,0.7062,5.8934,0.0025,5.2259,3.1914,1.6522,2.113,2.5749,4.4543,1.722,3.4305,4.2065,0.8299,1.926,6.0578,2.5699,1.5133,3.558,4.1691,2.5999,3.5892,0.7212,2.0784,1.5897,0.7104,5.8027,0.3049,2.4242,4.3611,1.4905,1.7059,1.8803,0.55,4.7799,4.1651,1.8525,5.1152,2.7042,1.8897,5.5295,1.9515,0.1482,1.2957,3.3688,2.2648,4.4402,4.6037,1.205,0.6388,2.5444,4.5144,1.1033,0.3909,5.2606,3.8897,2.4626,1.4665,2.0862,2.3449,0.8698,1.4353,2.3635,1.0303,2.9157,0.5115,1.2815,5.4591,2.188,4.6022,3.8369,4.6134,1.4019,0.2418,0.9326,0.3021,2.7798,5.2914,0.1126,1.8742,0.0002,0.8345,0.029,2.1497,3.2216,3.6692,1.8174,3.1898,3.9363,2.1421,1.5281,1.1968,1.7016,2.1146,3.5832,2.079,4.143,0.2343,0.5419,0.9213,5.1168,3.1562,1.0345,3.9702,0.7915,0.0436,0.3255,4.1126,3.9363,2.1175,1.8555,0.734,0.374,3.6669,0.0068,0.7798,0.2305,0.6381,0.0002,3.0378,2.9579,3.6348,5.4664,0.0044,4.4278,0.635,1.3315,1.0554,0.8539,4.0786,1.9354,0.1882,0.7866,2.9655,2.3949,3.3667,0.3756,0.4147,2.989,3.9022,6.0885,0.0046,2.1416,2.2313,2.8109,1.6381,2.867,2.5637,1.8845,1.5989,0.3065,1.5681,0.0001,4.8358,0.1104,3.7262,0.2486,1.1259,3.0938,2.5801,0.0063,3.6049,2.9168,3.4293,1.5241,3.0685,3.8488,2.4091,3.4774,0.8024,0.7747,1.1322,0.001,4.0111,2.7217,0.311,3.7697,4.7254,2.802,2.8514,3.7955,0.0409,2.752,0.3615,0.6114,0.001,0.0016,2.1655,2.0187,1.7905,1.1776,3.43,0.3946,4.0527,1.2165,2.8,4.1412,0.9386,3.6706,0.0004,0.322,0.253,0.0085,2.4039,1.4088,2.8763,1.7719,0.4646,0.9023,0.0011,4.0307,0.3323,2.6788,5.6666,0.7226,5.4488,0.7866,5.0309,0.688,0.3651,5.0042,2.9056,4.0994,1.6219,4.2924,0.0265,0.0192,0.0388,1.2424,6.3877,5.6256,0.0004,4.6319,1.0601,3.0895,0.9768,1.9153,3.3048,2.6144,4.2252,1.8796,4.2919,4.0522,0.9692,3.3558,0.0744,2.8266,1.3493,2.5001,3.3591,4.6183,0.5147,1.129,0.8217,4.9917,1.4538,4.6351,0.1827,2.3262,0.4402,1.7049,1.7506,3.7808,0.217,1.9531,2.1329,4.9213,0.6864,2.8618,0.0012,3.4786,2.906,2.3766,3.5544,0.9169,2.1362,3.8286,0.315,4.9422,0.6277,3.3163,0.4482,1.1133,5.8663,0.008,4.7126,3.1034,0.8115,0.0002,5.4173,0.8463,6.5304,0.9755,0.0056,0.0039,3.2514,0.1884,0.0371,1.794,0.6062,4.3777,4.7904,0.0603,4.4625,1.5116,4.9047,0.9531,1.9219,4.9435,1.3803,2.4829,3.4323,0.0332,1.1765,2.3065,0.0202,2.5298,1.8282,1.6685,5.0784,4.2543,1.1952,0.1507,0.4788,0.0017,1.1812,1.1729,3.0892,3.8773,0.0037,3.1514,4.4651,0.363,2.4025,0.5637,2.7277,4.1129,1.3396,2.437,1.0895,1.1203,3.3175,3.6696,0.57,0.0614,0.5763,0.0007,0.3474,0.9314,0.0002,4.6159,0.4923,1.4936,0.1076,4.4751,1.7719,1.4557,0.1107,0.0269,0.1824,2.5765,1.5723,5.2515,0.3258,1.8234,3.6865,1.7435,0.1661,0.0001,4.7302,2.8622,2.0373,0.0336,3.1678,1.7232,3.7683,3.7872,0.4861,1.6009]}

{"id":4284,"ended":true,"length":591,"gen_text":"One day on a crowded beach you find a message in a bottle. It reads, `` I'm so sorry to have done this to you. '' You look up and the beach is empty. You are alone. You never go back home. \u00a0You walk home on the other side of the bed because nobody seems to talk to you anymore. I never thought it would happen. My life was ruined by this incident. I have done what I can. God has saved me. I have no time for anything. \u00a0This is nothing in itself. \u00a0God has saved us all. God has placed me where he wants me to be. \u00a0All my love and love has been with me. Everything that I could have done would have made for better opportunities.\u00a0. If I did this to myself, I would not have made it. I know God never takes things away from me. He is giving me hope. It is amazing how many times I can remember that I'd heard it and never felt betrayed. He does not talk to me anymore. He does not talk to me anymore. This is his gift for me.. I pray for forgiveness. If I don't let this happen to me, I will not be able to live my life. God has given me hope.. I feel I am living my new life, even if I feel like it isn't for me. I am only now realizing how I went wrong. This is why we need to give God this amazing healing he always gives me. He's the same man who gave me so many years. God gave me forgiveness, and now God is waiting for us to get our hands on God and forgive us.\u00a0 It has been a year since we last met and I can't tell anyone what happened but I still feel completely okay. I feel very well at my new life, I am in very good health. My baby girl didn't even get the first part of her life. I will be forever thankful that God gave this person a chance to grow up. The only thing that makes this situation so much worse is when I feel like this is my last chance. My husband left him so I got married, it was over so when I finally saw her, I knew that God did not give a second thought to how I was going to feel. We lost our beautiful little girl, but we were just so happy. That is all I have now for now and I think that God has taught me something to come back. I now know why I felt so sad and disappointed. I knew that going with God, my wife, my boyfriend, my family and this place to live was not the best course. God gave me this chance that I would never have if I could simply come back home and have the right chance to live a happy life with all of these good people. I am so thankful God was right for me, and now I will forever be thankful for God for giving me such a wonderful life.","token_len":603,"entropy":[6.8149,5.0477,3.3799,6.0752,3.9623,5.2943,3.7353,2.1189,7.7541,3.1884,1.7138,4.6972,1.9528,1.8867,2.1285,1.4009,8.1188,8.9481,1.8698,4.4981,0.7252,3.6134,3.0683,4.5217,0.5096,1.1763,0.3562,1.0965,5.3625,2.3923,4.0251,1.6647,1.072,3.6691,8.1614,0.9802,2.8851,0.3938,1.6332,3.4978,3.328,0.9825,1.3742,5.5152,4.1202,0.572,3.8724,0.5853,6.0742,0.7936,1.3336,4.525,3.7016,4.2003,1.2392,3.888,0.0707,0.3577,0.2512,6.6557,5.7219,4.5441,3.5018,0.0308,4.664,0.5752,0.032,2.3762,0.1865,4.0832,3.9353,2.3097,2.9942,0.3366,1.0928,1.7498,4.4807,2.9895,1.9666,1.9126,2.482,0.8664,4.5184,0.4447,1.1861,2.9485,4.6763,3.4365,0.3429,1.6745,2.5947,6.5499,2.4247,3.4844,0.3136,0.6867,0.9751,2.2621,3.4801,5.0186,1.28,3.4245,2.4456,3.1365,0.0012,3.7036,0.6012,5.1901,5.1931,3.0046,0.647,2.0797,0.0012,3.7656,1.3272,2.1485,3.1329,1.1258,0.4167,2.765,0.7525,4.9853,1.1216,3.1397,1.7174,0.7374,0.1558,0.7987,0.0706,0.354,1.4927,0.0011,5.1547,2.9553,3.9285,1.2174,3.3596,2.3221,0.4053,2.889,1.0452,0.6568,5.4292,2.2035,0.9214,4.8065,0.9056,0.9992,2.8064,0.1519,3.9072,4.8062,2.761,6.4674,0.6577,5.3337,9.6544,4.8887,1.1555,3.5553,3.1064,0.7104,1.8631,0.7513,0.6207,0.3565,1.7871,0.4491,3.4414,1.0295,1.2501,1.2447,3.813,2.2813,4.9778,3.9853,3.8928,2.7627,0.2805,0.9688,0.3295,1.8115,2.7921,5.5179,0.1842,3.4884,0.7758,3.9084,0.7306,4.5876,1.4026,2.5867,1.7388,0.4694,4.7775,2.9391,2.3431,1.6712,7.4815,5.5895,3.6999,2.9676,3.7912,3.0025,5.5956,0.4089,4.5139,4.2483,0.8549,5.329,0.9849,0.3207,1.5283,0.2759,0.6516,2.2336,0.0764,2.6679,0.2331,0.599,2.3248,0.1127,4.8442,0.5388,4.2506,4.2474,3.7618,0.3567,8.7607,2.1335,5.3803,1.3776,4.8002,0.9136,4.4255,0.947,2.6898,0.0004,5.4225,1.8956,0.4494,0.939,0.4876,0.5666,0.7573,0.7609,2.4994,1.194,0.5958,0.0011,2.1762,1.1536,0.1591,1.3916,2.7195,1.6995,1.4906,0.0632,2.1646,4.0115,1.3052,3.7022,3.9905,1.4684,4.0154,1.6775,5.8914,0.1252,3.4572,4.457,1.3542,0.9604,4.3493,1.4536,1.1282,3.1567,0.0008,3.4843,0.6597,0.2856,0.9123,1.8287,5.4646,4.0916,1.5722,1.3705,4.004,5.9393,1.4284,0.5598,3.8207,0.7413,3.3779,4.4267,1.9044,0.4468,4.8054,2.5951,4.7747,5.147,4.8646,4.6676,5.6316,1.5295,2.9641,0.3331,2.559,4.4434,3.4552,5.1785,2.9481,0.8226,2.0965,0.474,2.9585,1.4211,3.1622,4.8084,2.801,2.0981,0.1901,5.1918,2.6446,2.0316,1.6809,3.7358,1.0381,5.2318,0.1763,2.9976,0.529,3.1799,3.7079,3.0847,0.1254,3.5762,2.9014,3.2268,0.8255,0.789,4.0745,4.7737,3.9034,0.8686,1.5611,4.1174,0.7205,2.3907,2.3777,2.0378,1.9654,1.2645,2.9533,0.5472,3.7816,5.13,2.0078,2.081,3.1335,0.9174,4.2426,1.1664,5.4735,3.2432,0.386,0.9163,2.4595,3.6708,4.1133,5.4777,3.4211,0.8634,2.8102,2.6901,1.8239,1.9179,3.4732,4.2819,0.0967,1.4826,1.6508,3.1006,5.4382,2.095,7.1626,0.0007,3.3532,2.7265,3.0469,3.3472,5.6555,0.0732,1.3191,2.6414,1.1181,1.2697,4.0862,2.0582,2.8337,2.0709,2.7647,0.455,1.98,4.1603,3.5829,2.4279,1.2773,0.6122,2.2827,0.544,1.3547,4.1606,2.4981,0.5649,0.9477,3.669,1.9971,3.0296,2.1542,1.0944,0.9008,0.209,3.4621,1.5762,2.8114,0.5312,3.8983,1.2593,1.6763,1.2458,0.4294,1.243,3.7307,3.5023,4.9076,4.7162,3.7936,1.5168,5.4411,3.5638,3.0497,3.8488,0.9177,5.3484,3.0946,4.9457,0.7317,2.824,3.0128,4.5116,2.3707,0.5523,1.7762,1.6106,2.0777,4.5017,0.6485,1.7706,3.2296,1.3445,0.6867,0.2474,4.2462,1.4626,1.8445,0.1847,0.0083,1.6297,0.893,3.9044,4.4745,0.9935,3.5075,1.8626,0.2967,1.7575,2.596,1.8624,2.3299,4.1503,1.2239,0.826,1.7026,5.1447,1.5341,2.9645,1.309,2.3767,2.854,3.9016,2.0386,3.5053,0.6993,4.9208,1.6713,1.3145,2.2825,5.3591,0.2539,3.5339,3.4195,4.9991,0.4505,3.8069,1.0551,6.0338,1.5489,4.539,0.9035,3.8814,0.5426,3.3826,1.7131,3.9768,1.5376,0.7519,3.9289,0.7221,6.9109,5.0064,1.3081,4.0267,4.7614,3.8547,0.7781,1.6532,4.6463,0.5283,1.1547,3.1294,1.2127,5.1205,3.6843,4.0082,0.6629,1.0643,2.0468,1.8078,1.6796,5.8805,4.1642,3.1916,2.463,0.3718,2.7211,2.1178,4.8032,0.5957,3.3212,0.7211,0.5752,3.2014,0.2654,3.4612,5.2068,3.6806,0.4733,1.5915,1.1069,3.1096,2.8106,4.4293,4.8212,0.6719,1.1326,2.5993,1.8921,0.7228,2.7212,3.9625,0.9108,3.5258,4.9962,0.1422,0.7306,1.0307,1.9612,1.263,1.2021,2.8304,4.6147,3.4239,0.6786,0.3519,2.6257,1.3792,3.0504,0.5544,3.5197,4.8016,1.0821,0.9932,0.7793,1.6851,1.8027,1.1796,0.0956,3.6341,0.5376,1.4637,1.2418,0.344]}
{"id":113,"ended":true,"length":590,"gen_text":"You are C\u00fa Chulainn reborn in modern times, and I want to say something about your history and your experience. I know how much I have loved and loved writing for a long time and still enjoy you, and that's really what makes this page so special. Here is my response.\n\nI was once called a liar after coming across a document titled \"I am your father and mother and now I am your mom.\" This document was actually filed under the name of Carlos Flores Gonzalez. The page you are now reading about was actually filed under the name of Juan Carlos Gonzalez on 9th October 1986.\n\nI'm not going to lie, I don't know your parents. I know what a lie you are being. I am very grateful to you for coming along with me and talking to me about your experiences together. Also, and probably most importantly, my family, and there are many more here and now.\n\nMy personal connection with you goes back to early childhood in Mexico. I was given a great number of things when I was very young to have a good childhood like I did. These days, I don't have very much to say about them other than to say thanks. When I was 5, my teacher told me about the way your mother, who had already had a great life working in the field, and who had always done wonders for life's success, had spent her entire life being a teacher at the Mexican high schools. That's a great thing, but it's a different story today and it's something that you can relate to if necessary.\n\nNow, the rest of my point you're making, is that this page should be an apology. One that addresses a lot of very real issues in your life that didn't even exist before, where you were raised. I don't know how that's possible, but you will not be silenced. The only thing that will be silenced, and only when you are given the chance, will be that we will be left alone. If you want, you can get some from one of us, and the only way you can turn that into a form of healing. So we won't be silenced, and you will get help from our friends. If you continue your life in the same way that you did, that just means you will now have to learn about yourself to better relate with your real people. Even less.

He's fully functioning and just doesn't get tired like other people.\n\nHis daughter was in the ICU for six minutes before the doctor sent her home because he 'didn't want to spend the day in pain.\n\nAn emergency meeting was convened by a group of NHS Trusts on Thursday where they determined that Mr Thomas should be transferred back to his native Northamptonshire\n\nA man has a medical condition where he can not sleep. Had it since birth and tries to keep it secret. His daughter was in the ICU for six minutes before the doctor sent her home because he 'didn't want to spend the day with pain. A doctor said: 'The medical evidence now says he needs to be transferred back to Northamptonshire and he is too ill to use norotic fluids. He needs to start from scratch and the nurses must give up. As far as there is available data here we assume he will live at home so his symptoms are quite serious.\n\n'There is no indication in any of our medical files that there is not a serious illness. Any of the nurses involved have said they do not have any symptoms. They have already started the process to give him the proper treatments. The medical evidence is now in the National Archives and we will send the results to their appropriate offices.\n\n'All the research has been done by my colleagues at the HMO over the two days because we have already established what they find to be clinically significant.\n\nAfter this meeting two nurses said they received no more complaints when the NRC first assessed the patient, then gave him the treatment. He was on his own in hospital and this is how he came out. One patient, a nurse at the Sacks Hospital in Hackney recently, said: 'This may be the final piece in a long story'. A consultant agreed the case was over and he needed to be transferred. There was little to show he was actually having pain, he just wanted to leave the side of his body. If that had taken place, he would have been dead.'\n\nA nurse at the HMO said: 'I did not hear anything. I was on duty, not on duty. He said he had just been born. That is all I knew now.

{"id":272,"ended":true,"length":568,"gen_text":"Tell a story by describing one scene.\n\n. The final words of the book describe the moment when the man who shot his own daughter died and all the things that happened afterward.\n\ntells the story in several different ways: as a child, she learned to run.\n\nshe was a strong man. Now she and her mother are just getting used to it.\n\nshe wanted to be a good lady. And her mother is so proud of herself that she has stopped trying to hide from her stepmother who is now a very beautiful young woman.\n\nHer stepmother is a beautiful young woman with perfect looks, beautiful hair, very bright white eyes. Her stepmother was the first woman to marry another man. But he is trying to get back her stepmother, who died suddenly during the night, and help her run again.\n\nI can never imagine how a very young child would say such harsh words about some of the other female witnesses.\n\nI couldn't understand why any of them would do such a thing.\n\nI just hope this helps you.\n\nAnd, when you are very young, you learn to love your own body.\n\nI'd love to see your body in the photos now.\n\nYou do have to put on a jacket, but don't you worry. Just make sure you get your face right at the end.\n\nWhen you are two as young, you know you have a chance to be kind to one another. That is why you must make an art of it if you want to be a happy woman.\n\nI also love to see women who are very passionate about their bodies. One girl, a very young very beautiful mother, told I am a bit of a slut, just like her stepmother. At first we felt that she couldn't keep up with us, but she started coming forward. There she is, and with lots of kindness and love, she will let me try again. I think her mother's voice, it was beautiful.\n\nI also want to see some of the beautiful young women who have seen her in pictures. People do not always do very well with women. They can be incredibly shy or very sad. There is a good deal for sure that can be said about young women. I will not stop there. I really want to see more young young women. I want to see young women, my wife, my boyfriend, my sister, my grandmother, my mom. I want them.\n\nI think it is worth mentioning that these young women were all very sad when they died. They saw the end to my life, all of these good things they could do.\n\nNow that you know how terrible it can be to be sad, it is time to take a deep breath, to take a deep breath that no one can help you with. This is really how you can be a beautiful husband, man and wife once you have that sense of responsibility.","token_len":606,"entropy":[4.1301,3.573,5.4508,8.5236,4.2657,5.6139,2.9452,1.3483,0.0039,7.5328,4.2216,5.7571,5.2506,1.2404,1.2751,3.1358,4.7885,1.416,4.475,1.7269,1.726,4.6649,2.6233,4.1945,3.6779,3.6051,2.4591,3.3621,2.9434,5.0351,1.1298,4.6131,0.7402,1.4562,2.0325,0.8967,0.7586,0.0002,8.7691,0.1758,1.1689,0.251,3.6214,5.736,0.8992,0.9404,2.6638,4.965,0.7532,3.238,0.5328,3.1761,4.4328,0.9391,5.4729,3.5875,2.5715,0.0002,2.1654,2.2446,1.6597,4.8045,4.5974,1.1205,6.8269,0.644,6.047,0.3077,2.477,1.6896,5.0376,4.0125,3.516,0.0071,1.458,0.2253,0.4454,0.0002,1.3064,5.4326,0.333,0.8961,0.6909,2.4428,5.6589,0.4643,3.5494,3.6127,1.2819,2.5181,3.6824,2.3505,0.2893,4.7867,0.9238,0.1605,2.9935,5.2997,3.1514,0.2525,3.1921,2.7196,0.6489,5.6959,1.4553,4.6365,1.5681,3.5555,2.1656,3.8452,3.4014,2.6706,0.8613,0.5256,0.3855,0.0002,4.9866,1.5132,0.3518,1.3288,1.9151,2.306,0.3935,0.4642,3.1852,5.5036,3.2236,1.9869,3.3177,1.2015,0.6913,4.2483,2.9518,5.2391,0.3001,1.6019,2.82,1.1247,0.9991,3.0617,2.8568,2.262,2.1383,1.051,3.2135,5.3313,0.5081,0.9807,4.1136,3.762,3.2451,6.2754,0.1684,2.1558,3.5463,3.6226,1.8387,0.5302,2.324,2.6849,4.6155,3.6795,5.2649,1.1151,2.5567,1.7498,1.0557,5.9415,0.3103,5.6269,2.7942,0.3255,0.7893,0.0002,4.9373,3.6615,4.9654,2.9179,1.7473,3.2951,4.5886,1.9242,2.5594,1.2494,5.3966,4.289,7.2139,0.8477,1.7489,5.8364,2.0242,0.8006,3.3417,6.0226,4.4676,0.9135,1.1014,0.0002,2.2541,4.7864,0.0013,3.0924,1.5241,4.0676,1.1252,0.7489,0.5058,2.2599,0.9108,0.6052,0.1909,0.4457,0.908,0.0002,1.7281,4.153,3.5064,3.6275,3.7761,2.3947,1.4202,0.4936,0.0002,4.1156,3.34,4.6122,0.7969,2.5577,5.819,0.4318,0.2376,1.1022,3.5547,0.7746,2.5842,1.6082,3.0548,1.344,0.8111,0.5243,0.0003,2.4214,4.9419,1.5142,0.1623,1.6359,2.4139,2.6814,2.3044,1.6628,5.0339,5.9995,0.4345,0.4338,0.0003,3.2595,4.8928,2.23,1.2665,4.704,2.124,1.1801,5.1735,2.0395,2.2468,3.3177,0.0002,2.9005,3.362,1.2406,4.4387,2.9057,0.1291,0.7182,3.4886,1.8545,3.9345,1.2104,4.4672,0.5353,1.4426,0.8294,0.4091,0.0002,4.3969,0.5832,0.9061,6.1938,7.464,0.6911,2.1328,0.6182,4.4277,1.8307,2.0894,1.9507,2.3625,0.6251,1.5537,5.5238,1.0995,2.713,0.0275,0.3395,4.593,1.3713,1.642,1.1758,3.5856,3.8349,4.4547,6.5242,0.289,2.453,6.2544,0.0367,0.5377,0.1387,1.0929,1.3875,5.2401,1.8743,0.2167,0.3332,0.0003,2.2554,4.9169,2.7993,1.4696,1.321,3.6362,1.8713,1.2587,2.4756,4.6843,0.2299,1.0492,1.2431,0.6599,5.5236,4.5283,3.026,2.806,2.6783,2.9043,6.4957,0.6319,5.1589,0.484,2.7525,6.7925,3.718,2.3042,4.8205,1.4535,0.1271,3.595,2.2168,5.0732,1.4378,2.2785,1.8646,0.7697,0.5082,6.2729,1.8457,4.7349,5.5084,2.0941,1.1066,4.877,0.0004,4.7116,1.2471,0.372,1.6564,1.1572,0.4913,1.6599,3.641,4.5861,3.2227,1.4249,5.5236,4.4565,1.0022,1.2753,2.7413,5.1453,6.3222,0.0477,5.5415,0.8318,1.4628,1.2542,0.9804,3.7532,3.4694,1.9423,5.1111,2.318,0.4937,2.5658,3.0505,3.9493,2.6525,3.6581,5.1238,4.1256,4.4846,2.5487,3.3953,0.5645,0.823,0.0002,1.574,2.7906,2.3319,0.1061,1.1967,3.3254,0.9095,0.4955,3.542,2.3964,0.5329,0.5559,2.0589,5.1511,3.8937,2.5043,2.8414,0.8911,5.7957,4.8429,1.7142,2.2092,5.116,5.1236,0.2125,1.7486,1.9023,1.3906,2.6043,2.9735,1.0773,5.6784,3.6117,2.4103,1.8855,4.4095,0.815,4.1584,1.2008,1.2375,3.9338,3.3088,5.6326,4.8016,2.4931,3.1544,1.3428,2.597,0.6396,2.8567,0.3011,0.882,2.4015,4.4258,2.7615,4.0687,2.5277,0.2459,1.413,4.9339,1.1205,0.1568,0.2809,2.0817,1.8233,4.4837,0.1665,1.5919,1.6975,1.3166,0.2447,0.2316,3.2155,0.6591,4.624,5.3999,4.4488,0.7955,0.8792,5.0254,0.5768,1.0304,2.7677,0.6888,0.8391,4.5468,0.7563,1.1611,4.0298,1.3208,1.4686,0.5346,2.6866,4.8408,0.8944,0.0002,1.0895,3.2116,1.8979,0.5828,5.3088,3.5641,0.4285,4.1664,1.3395,0.1899,3.1522,3.0004,1.4502,5.2345,2.8612,0.3585,3.0583,0.3778,1.6763,5.9109,2.289,4.2847,3.7362,4.4589,0.433,1.4238,5.5627,1.4731,4.2057,5.1315,0.3438,3.4442,3.2375,2.0886,1.3567,1.559,0.0002,4.0038,2.7738,1.8424,1.7296,2.1166,6.0469,1.5673,2.0456,0.1906,0.91,1.4641,2.8985,1.2637,2.4872,0.5968,1.5437,0.3402,3.2118,1.0963,2.7217,0.0392,2.0084,1.9098,2.9646,0.4595,0.3475,0.4009,4.2847,5.0858,0.3468,1.5877,3.8311,0.1854,1.1817,0.5079,4.5646,0.5245,4.8011,4.0916,2.2121,2.0672,2.4922,1.3943,3.543,7.7581,1.5019,6.578,1.836,1.3904,6.2885,0.7371,1.0219,5.2619,5.2038,0.0778,4.474,0.6554]}
{"id":3027,"ended":true,"length":573,"gen_text":"After 3000 years of observing and documenting the human race, immortal moderators from a star system far beyond ours prepare their final report and recommendations for the Council of Preservation.\n\nIn the final report of the Council of Preservation, the scientists of the Human Centaur Group have developed a unique and powerful technology: a sensor system that controls the movement in the solar system as well as the natural movement of planets and planets around us. This device of discovery should revolutionize our understanding of the universe.\n\nThese sensors are designed to control the actions of human beings and give them unprecedented insight into the universe's dynamics and planetary processes. This new system has been developed using powerful advanced AI technologies and allows for fast discovery of objects and comets as well as small solar systems. This system is an important one as it provides an unprecedented opportunity to study more precisely what happens in the cosmos and to learn more about this amazing force that controls its natural movement.\n\nThese devices can help us build what will be an unprecedented, planetary research effort using new and revolutionary AI technologies such as the Human Centaur Group System, which has recently been found to allow for a completely unique and dynamic system to govern the entire solar system.\n\nThe Human Centaur Group has been working on this project very closely for nearly 30 years. Through these three years, we've been studying the process by which the Milky Way became the center of cosmic dust, while also examining the processes by which these planets and stars became \"waxy\" due to the sun's collision with the outer galaxies due to stellar collisions as they were growing larger. The Human Centaur Group has been instrumental in helping to create these planetary systems as the very first large stars became visible, then as smaller stars became visible due to merging. When their light and energy are compared with each other and compared to the size of their galaxies we can understand that the planets grew to giant size and eventually moved to distant galaxies.\n\nThe new system that the Human Centaur Group will work on incorporates two technologies that will enable it to directly map these two new systems: the Sensor Technology, an AI that will control Earth's motion and the System Management, a single command-and-control system that controls the behavior of many planets around the galaxy. This new approach allows us to do even more than our predecessors and gives us a whole new sense of mission and mission accomplishment.\n\nWhat is important is that the system has a unique, universal purpose, that will help us better understand why our universe continues to grow and we need to learn about the whole, interconnected universe. For some of these systems scientists have worked to create tools that allow us to work on our own understanding of this large system, and we are grateful for the advances our discoveries have made.\n\nYou can find out more about human and biotic communication (especially about the interdependence of biotic and human life) in the Human Centaur Group report titled \" Our Human Centaur Group Interfaces with the Galactic Machine \" - here.","token_len":606,"entropy":[11.7249,1.6823,1.6118,8.1533,3.4848,4.5277,1.2745,4.6556,3.5173,0.5098,11.6954,13.6876,4.6364,3.9243,7.2948,0.7977,5.7746,1.4877,4.3111,12.1958,4.1446,5.3906,2.372,3.2872,6.6335,1.2852,1.1991,5.463,0.9986,8.4087,1.0621,1.469,0.0061,3.5663,1.6213,3.9639,0.5938,1.6716,0.7598,1.0596,0.7324,0.0326,0.3531,1.906,5.8255,4.0432,0.7607,4.3072,4.1737,1.9867,5.9087,3.8044,3.992,0.5922,3.4741,2.8713,3.2964,2.8564,3.1939,1.6877,5.6909,3.5052,0.7324,5.2511,0.8522,3.901,6.295,1.6931,3.8226,0.0397,4.5096,0.905,0.0074,0.9481,5.5944,3.5424,0.1789,2.8649,1.6809,3.5642,1.6598,2.4135,0.1853,2.1934,4.1352,6.1127,4.2029,6.4263,2.849,0.0539,1.9251,0.4096,0.0421,0.8343,2.805,1.8952,0.6863,0.0002,4.9449,2.1684,1.4284,3.3522,0.2508,4.1725,0.8368,5.5572,0.1251,4.2268,0.3849,2.3686,5.0092,0.7369,3.4169,1.9637,0.0821,0.7605,3.6379,1.9789,3.4162,1.35,4.5007,3.6468,0.1731,3.0952,2.5245,2.8864,3.039,1.2796,1.573,3.1646,5.8897,4.1941,4.3407,2.3403,1.5384,5.3282,1.9531,5.8332,4.624,1.1613,5.6587,1.3883,6.016,0.004,4.1984,0.5836,0.0095,4.9658,5.0421,0.5934,0.946,2.9635,1.829,1.42,4.7356,2.1332,5.6833,2.3561,0.6412,2.9242,2.5681,1.3884,2.162,0.4717,1.9832,6.1014,5.9656,2.5216,2.2438,1.176,0.4473,3.3769,1.5264,2.1486,3.177,1.1129,0.0341,4.9922,4.2977,4.6134,2.0846,2.215,5.652,4.698,1.7597,0.3204,0.3476,0.0001,4.2236,4.447,2.7462,3.884,1.3261,5.6531,6.1728,3.2193,1.1523,2.0793,1.9779,4.1682,5.3698,4.2727,3.3234,5.4441,3.7457,2.7201,3.8197,3.3739,0.8944,4.4912,0.003,1.5686,4.1049,0.2846,0.0048,1.8569,5.8096,2.3113,1.6532,2.3149,4.7046,0.7142,4.9895,0.6821,4.7696,0.8149,2.923,4.9889,4.4559,1.1682,5.1376,2.8932,2.4186,4.1196,0.8769,3.6984,1.1294,0.0051,0.2974,0.7125,0.0001,1.5811,2.0468,0.0219,0.0031,0.1001,3.4089,1.284,2.6706,1.2559,1.5905,1.2675,7.2604,0.3625,1.2263,3.3177,2.7742,0.011,0.8706,4.4114,3.6317,4.023,0.9058,0.7414,0.9162,2.7264,1.6137,4.0352,1.1223,4.7067,2.3356,0.0051,1.4505,4.3742,0.0004,5.5859,1.7347,0.6724,0.0316,5.3048,5.1908,1.8345,5.1488,2.4687,3.5874,0.6458,3.2049,1.81,0.0006,3.2026,1.9968,1.5844,2.1246,2.7071,4.0771,4.3585,4.5472,1.1423,5.5358,0.0032,1.0165,5.5575,0.35,5.3808,0.1538,0.549,4.0199,5.3357,6.9993,0.0032,4.7947,1.5072,5.8564,2.7012,2.2914,5.0325,1.8814,0.7497,3.1331,2.877,0.0112,0.0012,0.0823,1.5998,1.2571,5.1883,0.0382,3.9457,1.4236,3.1659,3.1087,3.6056,0.4546,2.8286,3.6451,5.5537,0.92,4.8546,3.1532,3.6283,2.2922,2.7352,4.9756,4.7753,4.1357,1.0514,0.7238,0.6119,3.7405,0.0019,4.9632,2.3874,5.4081,6.1895,4.6854,4.2523,1.7131,2.4751,4.5033,1.8788,2.8741,0.0135,2.4278,3.0824,1.1789,0.7493,4.8531,0.2142,2.303,3.5651,5.2611,0.8064,3.9269,2.2796,1.1598,3.6377,5.6451,3.2531,6.0436,1.2878,2.1418,3.3513,5.3184,1.4988,5.4193,1.5757,0.8558,0.8099,0.0002,1.7985,4.1675,1.8062,3.3613,1.8389,0.4436,0.0062,0.0013,0.0096,4.1842,3.9437,0.6561,6.5073,4.1738,4.1574,1.4067,2.0139,3.0394,1.6374,0.0296,5.3661,5.0598,3.1111,3.5597,4.9051,1.4863,2.7536,1.3924,5.1752,4.8626,2.8047,4.3515,2.3265,2.8783,2.4324,2.674,5.5941,0.3285,2.3666,1.2643,1.4387,4.2473,5.0328,0.991,0.8809,5.1803,5.5464,2.2187,0.5351,0.0079,0.0063,0.4572,0.4864,2.4006,0.8126,4.0971,0.0749,4.7384,2.4099,2.3997,1.0414,2.5166,0.4481,3.2945,1.3208,4.5493,2.6457,1.7369,0.0364,5.327,4.1059,0.1553,2.0506,3.4468,1.7067,2.341,4.6663,0.2156,1.3985,3.664,0.0322,4.9069,0.0633,6.2868,1.6135,2.0643,2.4041,0.6232,0.3625,0.0001,4.1151,1.4801,5.3524,2.0117,0.3031,1.2913,3.0244,3.3643,2.1584,3.1595,2.6203,5.0272,2.3494,2.1157,2.8267,1.8463,3.1291,0.7131,3.9322,0.0978,4.8291,1.9926,2.5531,3.6729,0.0592,1.0302,0.9064,4.5835,3.664,0.3543,2.7755,2.6971,1.3313,4.3828,4.5887,4.229,0.8298,1.0317,4.8508,5.7138,1.858,2.4169,1.9951,3.4439,1.0502,4.1608,2.4728,2.0633,5.202,0.9298,1.835,0.9847,0.0261,4.8776,2.1931,3.787,0.2111,3.8942,0.2911,3.486,5.5476,2.9297,2.053,1.9737,3.1618,1.5457,3.7732,0.8734,1.1173,5.5689,4.8668,3.5513,0.4644,0.6408,0.8634,0.9511,0.0001,5.6506,0.3432,2.0754,0.9662,0.1404,0.1306,7.4569,3.055,5.2415,1.246,5.0184,5.9074,5.8259,4.7577,1.5269,4.482,4.4676,0.0289,0.5957,4.1038,0.1975,1.2365,1.8936,2.6013,0.7664,1.8337,0.8722,2.1991,0.1017,0.0016,0.0539,3.8032,4.3405,0.5814,8.8155,4.3846,1.1873,0.0053,0.5971,6.0887,1.7731,1.7383,1.1919,3.8485,5.1078,1.6069,5.8622,3.3222,0.3296]}

{"id":2950,"ended":true,"length":487,"gen_text":"The Earth has been conquered by an advanced alien civilization. Humans live an oppressive almost slave-like existence. You, a human, find out that the situation isn't that simple and conquering aliens aren't actually the `` bad guys ''. You are attacked by a giant robot known as C'est ile de l'Algos. In short: you are the only one who has the means to get humans anywhere near the human civilization of America. The situation is that you have been pushed further out of your country after coming across a giant robot.\n\nIt is a very good plot device where he shows human characters and people who were actually in the middle of some kind of war, and you try to understand how difficult it would be if you were doing something on Earth for which you are still alive, with no one else.\n\nIn any case, you do not know what to do. One can only be the hero in your life trying to solve the problems that are around you but that really doesn't really work. And you can be the hero, just to go find a problem and help somebody else who needs help.\n\n. You see... This might be the most frustrating line of dialogue and I can feel for many of you. I hope this helps you.\n\nAnd finally, if you were to do a bit of the \"bad guy theory\", all your friends and family will agree with you... You will know that the evil aliens... will make the best of your situation.

But it is not what the man expected at all.\n\nGod says that in the coming days those who fear Him will be sent to his punishment in Hell and all other things that have been created for the defense of His people in the time of their sinning and sufferings.\n\n. God has given us the promise that all his people and His saints will see all things in the Garden of Eden. They will have eyes for all things that they were not able to see.\n\n. The people will have eyes for all things that they were not able to see. The people will have eyes for all things that they were not able to see. There is no one more powerful than God. God will save all who can be saved. Everyone who has eyes for all things that they were not able to see will be saved. He will help none who can be saved. Everyone who has eyes for all things that they were not able to see will be saved.\n\n.. His promise to them is not in any way a gift of grace, but rather as something holy to the believers who love Him so that He may forgive them their sins (Romans 4:22 ).\n\n. His promise to them is not in any way a gift of grace, but rather as something holy to the believers who love Him so that He may forgive them their sins (Romans 4:22 ). It makes perfect sense because it is that which is promised to the saints who have eyes for all things that they were not able to see. Those who are able to see it will be able to be saved. The saints will be saved.\n\nWe live in this world but we know that the angels who serve God in their presence are never able to see that what we are seeing is not just an illusion. The angels will never see anything that is not true because there will never be any. The images in the world and dreams that can never be fulfilled are false, as is the vision that we have of God in the Garden of Eden, because not even the Lord can see.\n\nGod gives His people in the days of Noah to do what He promised them in the beginning, that they might have the knowledge that there were no nations and no gods.\n\n. They must do what He promised them, that they might have knowledge that there were no nations and no gods, even in death.\n\n. He knows that there, even as He told the Jews :\n\n\"' A nation cannot be born before it is brought forth from its mother earth. When it is born it has no birth to take its place.' (Jeremiah 34:18-21 ).\n\n. When it is born it has no birth to take its place. It is also certain that in the coming days, everyone will have eyes for all things that the Lord told the Jews :","token_len":607,"entropy":[5.385,10.3359,0.0164,1.0317,2.6308,3.6354,0.9395,7.2619,6.3327,1.9341,7.7037,3.7112,0.5693,5.845,0.6853,5.7758,4.2597,5.6916,3.5531,5.3859,2.7136,3.6082,2.457,1.438,3.2938,0.7856,3.8038,3.5681,0.9278,1.6018,4.571,2.9828,2.935,7.3148,5.3519,1.9419,0.5365,2.0628,0.0503,3.2642,3.7584,1.9677,3.8329,1.5146,5.2631,1.7995,5.9313,0.2461,5.6,1.0902,0.3702,1.4988,4.6291,1.4455,5.0996,4.4846,3.556,2.5998,2.7322,3.7747,4.1433,4.6434,1.5775,3.9363,1.4187,3.566,1.9564,1.8215,4.8742,0.0573,2.3348,1.0952,4.0421,1.2559,3.9247,0.0653,2.7057,2.8775,3.4217,2.3984,5.6524,0.006,0.2996,1.1844,0.0002,8.4235,4.155,3.1176,2.2496,2.7708,1.6547,4.9734,0.8381,3.1791,4.7134,1.3691,4.5295,2.904,3.3399,0.2639,4.7458,4.5523,0.8434,2.0598,1.3209,4.8254,0.1905,0.0099,1.3538,3.3857,0.2034,3.5871,5.5594,3.4285,1.4091,0.4812,1.9805,2.6775,6.4281,1.3327,1.2617,0.0263,0.0798,1.7402,1.4453,0.0001,1.3908,1.9351,2.6567,1.8497,2.4184,1.4305,0.3266,0.7499,0.0841,0.2107,0.2055,0.2901,0.071,0.0132,0.0015,0.0278,0.2344,2.0188,1.4703,0.1694,0.5511,0.4138,0.0805,0.3063,0.0403,0.0605,0.0833,0.1808,0.0264,0.0132,0.001,0.0249,0.1365,4.1576,2.321,0.9887,3.7383,4.742,3.1495,0.2958,0.4859,1.1027,3.0242,2.7516,4.5678,1.4111,2.5557,5.1109,2.1902,0.1805,0.7343,6.4623,0.7248,1.8527,5.0981,0.38,0.4357,0.0465,1.4198,0.8996,0.4608,0.0653,0.0238,0.0017,0.0222,1.0688,0.4911,0.5816,0.2738,3.9986,0.3576,4.8469,6.0722,1.7143,2.5368,0.5363,0.0637,0.4937,5.415,0.1018,0.4203,0.0626,0.0256,0.072,0.0147,0.0766,0.0743,0.0351,0.003,0.0042,0.001,0.0048,0.1069,0.0361,0.0071,0.0337,1.2375,0.0001,7.1555,5.2378,3.8783,1.879,3.2205,1.2994,2.6919,3.8376,2.5156,0.2371,1.7454,4.51,2.0538,3.1105,1.8,0.3978,2.2683,5.0008,5.708,6.3428,2.5844,1.9235,4.1073,2.7832,3.592,0.507,3.664,1.6256,1.3615,0.9876,4.2626,0.5391,2.2891,0.1474,4.8673,2.2703,0.2667,2.6072,0.0319,3.5121,4.8846,0.5813,0.0002,0.6245,2.4792,0.1059,0.1188,0.0411,0.0038,0.0095,0.011,0.0012,0.0021,0.005,0.0009,0.0007,0.0004,0.002,0.0009,0.0026,0.0031,0.0002,0.0018,0.0007,0.0018,0.0025,0.0016,0.001,0.0037,0.0003,0.0003,0.0042,0.0042,0.0083,0.0007,0.0002,0.0018,0.0319,0.0217,0.0004,0.0652,0.0027,0.0126,0.0357,3.2975,5.9456,2.608,0.2251,4.7094,2.3045,1.0977,5.5319,1.2262,1.7963,4.221,0.9762,1.5234,4.1504,3.0108,2.1921,1.6207,0.1042,0.248,0.0263,0.181,0.1093,0.0677,0.0228,0.0166,0.0016,0.0088,0.4116,4.598,0.2535,1.6483,2.4925,0.0703,0.1667,4.1653,1.0903,1.1005,2.1216,0.0064,3.9595,0.2178,0.5881,2.7475,2.481,1.0334,1.0588,0.8953,0.8119,0.6599,0.0002,5.6715,4.4028,0.2902,4.1501,0.9022,5.5877,1.1126,4.2137,0.8449,2.4355,5.2177,2.9055,5.3524,1.9346,2.7307,5.5384,3.3036,1.5587,5.6837,2.5043,0.0042,1.1621,4.4177,4.2321,1.7395,1.4963,0.6284,0.4417,2.1327,3.3849,3.1715,0.4304,0.9819,2.4883,1.557,2.7261,1.3736,0.3877,2.5853,0.9759,1.127,0.6255,2.9981,2.9471,3.2779,2.3334,0.9842,0.0273,1.557,4.8087,2.1794,6.1247,3.0708,0.7587,2.371,4.0654,6.2978,1.8195,5.4589,3.3301,0.3468,3.4271,1.5895,4.7242,2.7885,3.387,1.7446,0.3249,3.7532,1.5655,2.4713,1.4639,0.6782,1.6462,1.4751,1.0311,1.8023,0.0914,0.013,2.9968,3.4354,5.9755,2.6775,0.9568,4.6306,1.2598,0.3092,3.7345,0.8563,0.0002,2.5181,3.6343,3.2542,0.5718,3.2764,1.0707,5.1949,0.139,1.9877,2.1882,4.8021,1.2225,0.8115,3.062,0.9883,1.7551,0.5483,3.2126,1.8736,2.6311,1.0419,0.9101,2.5245,2.0004,1.8993,1.2891,3.2222,2.183,1.228,4.7302,2.3649,0.6728,0.7968,1.0355,1.6768,0.0002,1.5865,4.8766,4.0314,2.389,0.3587,0.9457,0.3098,0.0665,2.3645,1.1721,0.4073,0.1841,0.282,2.5301,0.62,0.2201,0.2674,0.0532,0.2308,0.148,0.0247,0.0115,2.4563,3.428,3.6157,5.474,0.5223,0.5852,0.0002,0.8294,3.0584,4.4278,0.8859,1.2237,7.5068,2.3218,3.6058,1.3473,3.9617,2.1152,3.5759,9.1404,2.0235,0.0007,4.7465,7.0673,1.968,4.2161,1.0464,3.8732,5.7185,1.5951,0.5769,3.8951,1.3452,2.1973,1.961,1.1147,3.9416,1.255,5.2548,1.1567,0.7609,2.8345,1.5674,3.6078,1.0573,3.4748,4.584,5.1499,1.288,0.2734,4.3805,1.9035,3.1557,0.0014,4.4324,0.0162,3.4465,1.5347,2.213,3.3299,0.1681,0.0003,0.3056,4.0945,0.5295,0.1042,0.8127,0.2112,0.004,0.0096,0.0096,0.0022,0.002,0.0007,0.0009,0.0497,3.3326,1.0632,4.7876,5.1994,0.1299,3.6086,0.6931,2.1693,0.2935,2.263,6.6388,1.3407,1.6525,0.7436,0.2004,0.2951,0.0448,0.1241,4.1855,1.8869,4.8568,2.2657,0.66,3.5072]}
{"id":1222,"ended":true,"length":567,"gen_text":"AI is actually far more advanced than the world knows. Google's AlphaGO is proud of his latest achievements and now demands more power. You are part of Googles AlphaGO Team and have to negotiate with the AI.\n\nHowever, that is exactly what you don't want to hear about!\n\nThe following post was posted by Alex Kuznetsov.\n\nI guess that's the word it sounds like now? Google CEO Eric Schmidt has been forced to admit that AI technology is far too complicated and is actually far more advanced than the world knows.\n\nGoogle's AlphaGO is actually far more advanced than the world knows. Google has taken the lead in solving some of the most common questions about self-driving cars; one that I recently wrote about in a recent article, with an impressive number of solutions:\n\nIt is now more than 40 years since the first self-driving car was invented in China. One of the first questions that are asked by people who really hope to develop autonomous and self-driving cars is whether, given their current size and power, the size of a conventional personal car can be scaled up so it wouldn't make too much noise. I know of many studies on the matter. As for some hypothetical vehicles, like the Tesla Model S, or even some small electric cars, I'm already looking at the problem through the lens of the technology, which will eventually enable the self-driving vehicles to run more efficiently. This is why we need deep learning, which works on many of the things we think we could do at scale today.\n\nWhen it comes to solving problems, the world's most advanced machines are the kind you'd need at least a little more skill.\n\nIt is not necessary to have deep learning knowledge to play the right game on AI and in the field of AI. Googles AlphaGo is not a complete automaton; it is a small computer of many years of work, mostly by people who are smart. However, the world knows for sure that there will be a game. The only thing that makes this game so interesting is its ability to navigate, understand, navigate, respond, and be human.\n\nI want to share not just the game itself, but also the AI that will play it, especially its human form. I am trying to do this as part of a project to promote my personal brand. When you spend some time with someone who is also going to be interacting with AI, you will encounter something that is different. They will interact with you from the first moment you start conversing with them.\n\nDo you think that some of these interactions will be in the form of speech and communication by humans? Is it possible for that to be really cool? Is it possible to do something so basic that makes human interaction a very interesting experience?\n\nDon't worry.

The team will continue their work at the Max Planck Institute for Health Physics in Germany, where they will work using human cells to develop a new, more potent vaccine against the infection.\n\n\"Once we have the new vaccine, we might make vaccines for hepatitis B, which has a different function, but we might not need to use a bacterium in those cases,\" said Dr. Michael Grudem, associate professor of electrophysiology and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \"And if we can improve, it means that we can stop treating it for this.\"\n\nFollow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.\n\nThe researchers noted that the virus might need to be more difficult to eradicate than previously thought, and could become even more challenging to control. It's unclear at this moment how much new research will be needed to confirm these concepts.\n\nExplore further: How much new research will be needed to confirm these concepts?","token_len":608,"entropy":[10.5299,3.3397,4.0107,5.474,2.8297,3.4247,1.0374,6.7968,0.0329,2.6804,5.9938,3.0739,0.1031,3.9115,3.5747,0.0755,1.3152,1.7222,4.2194,5.8465,3.3956,4.9147,0.143,7.5399,6.8869,2.0494,8.8354,8.833,2.4826,7.9598,1.4094,1.2695,0.0021,3.055,4.3248,2.5384,2.4902,2.2836,5.4399,3.0116,0.2018,4.8357,2.264,0.7532,1.8518,5.6677,0.4635,4.1913,3.5189,0.0597,5.3152,0.6101,3.3839,2.2341,2.2876,1.1043,2.6037,0.0012,3.0622,5.5443,5.0446,2.0495,1.6845,6.0666,2.7165,0.8293,1.0328,3.1364,4.5039,1.4875,0.1877,2.2029,3.255,1.5694,5.7613,0.5666,0.5994,0.0003,5.6275,1.6996,0.9727,2.1446,1.8897,1.1185,3.0622,0.3731,4.1517,0.007,0.0023,2.9544,4.365,4.0309,0.494,2.8661,4.0827,4.3065,0.4374,0.054,0.4544,2.2673,0.4305,0.3422,0.1877,1.7226,2.5743,2.831,3.7033,0.0861,4.6408,2.3842,0.9262,4.3961,2.8916,1.3847,3.7073,0.7464,0.1298,2.3369,0.3779,2.8372,1.8278,4.9274,1.9998,3.6992,1.8332,3.9705,0.8598,2.9943,0.7514,2.0077,4.9968,2.7669,2.4658,0.2738,0.2405,0.0003,1.4231,4.8374,2.2161,0.5591,5.7658,3.8532,0.048,1.954,2.9922,2.3965,6.1508,4.9513,2.6234,1.1183,4.8122,2.6267,1.0627,2.331,2.1742,1.4157,0.8132,1.8323,0.1507,3.9097,6.2496,4.1591,6.2285,1.4464,0.0011,0.1824,1.1801,6.0262,2.6506,2.3421,0.2185,0.6278,2.3732,0.8228,2.0087,3.585,0.0004,1.7824,0.3902,4.1329,1.1242,0.2437,1.3871,4.5419,0.7248,2.1894,5.3247,1.6412,5.8163,0.8152,3.7311,5.6476,0.2466,2.6052,2.6407,2.8954,4.7528,4.2569,2.3993,2.0283,3.3019,1.5012,2.8436,2.3236,2.4547,2.8562,0.1303,0.0002,5.4567,3.5309,5.7446,1.1999,2.7103,0.7384,0.6072,1.9734,0.0203,3.0239,1.1343,0.0021,2.1634,0.611,1.2826,1.3094,2.4547,3.2644,0.9685,5.987,5.2714,2.7596,1.7491,1.3214,0.8155,1.5436,2.0522,2.3008,6.668,3.7584,0.9824,2.7644,2.1744,3.9205,3.5107,0.0747,1.0409,2.1295,0.0738,6.9986,0.6427,0.2799,0.0002,1.9942,3.656,0.4153,3.52,0.2739,0.4485,0.1568,1.5813,1.6091,4.8907,1.4381,0.6008,1.9764,2.8794,4.0738,2.3133,1.968,0.0324,1.1712,0.5229,5.1792,0.0417,3.5976,4.5028,4.3019,0.7133,0.2209,4.7671,0.333,0.369,4.3906,0.0025,0.0214,0.0003,0.1225,0.0006,2.9808,0.5184,3.2768,1.33,2.126,0.7877,0.0183,4.6241,3.2155,1.0727,3.4217,3.1676,0.0003,3.012,0.7018,1.4813,0.0908,0.0002,2.9106,2.0713,1.8055,4.33,1.5689,2.0803,0.6328,5.853,1.0813,0.0041,0.0586,6.1061,2.3331,0.5428,1.2985,3.5132,6.2124,1.2353,1.57,2.3631,0.0304,4.3121,3.3735,1.1239,4.9418,4.7557,1.9811,4.2064,0.0181,2.7821,6.2916,1.3646,2.4362,6.2043,3.3479,1.6518,0.4625,3.6664,2.2372,5.253,2.1878,0.0033,3.9908,0.8313,0.0005,4.8632,5.6744,1.4936,2.6607,3.9824,0.9726,4.5093,0.0004,1.837,0.0019,2.6761,2.6602,5.372,2.8482,3.2649,1.4334,6.166,6.1867,5.3791,1.5849,4.0487,1.1374,0.1921,0.6115,0.0002,5.2375,1.618,3.1231,3.5108,1.6327,0.4638,1.2745,0.6218,5.9175,1.1911,1.5255,3.3338,4.6622,3.13,2.2498,4.1441,0.2465,4.4427,1.9191,1.6139,3.7098,3.7087,3.1147,4.5963,4.4098,1.4781,5.0757,0.6619,3.4774,1.7249,2.8495,2.8739,2.8226,0.6252,3.3682,0.6121,5.883,0.3063,0.0,0.0258,0.1019,4.5939,3.046,0.6402,1.9782,1.0828,0.9682,0.6178,1.7157,3.4982,6.4148,4.7951,0.9095,1.3349,2.9579,2.0457,1.6913,4.3058,1.4532,4.4792,1.9442,1.5379,0.8063,4.3369,0.2765,0.2871,0.0002,1.3526,5.7639,0.461,1.8149,1.9602,4.6043,1.3831,0.4777,0.4688,4.1244,4.6909,5.1707,1.7529,3.9389,1.0986,0.9164,2.4602,2.7275,1.8545,3.8377,4.3197,1.8524,1.1354,1.7508,2.3519,1.9134,3.3553,0.7901,2.1693,3.307,6.3926,0.102,2.592,4.006,1.136,0.4192,0.6862,0.7384,0.0011,3.0919,5.8311,4.3472,1.4974,1.114,4.2339,0.1864,0.2815,5.1349,0.2467,0.0615,0.0274,1.7156,2.5188,0.0158,0.178,4.7898,0.4412,1.6046,1.0839,0.015,0.0781,0.0016,0.0013,0.0229,0.9189,0.836,3.4225,2.654,0.5679,1.798,4.9473,5.2023,2.6692,5.06,1.0279,0.7495,0.933,4.2794,4.931,4.3319,3.8364,3.551,4.3486,0.2714,0.0002,3.8629,1.1806,0.0001,0.0015,0.0002,0.0001,0.0,0.0001,0.0002,0.0001,0.0,0.0001,0.0003,0.0007,0.0006,0.0009,0.001,0.0003,1.86,2.2233,4.4524,0.212,1.4897,2.1977,3.5679,5.5776,0.3864,0.432,4.2376,3.5539,0.0984,2.7286,1.8992,1.5962,0.3104,0.9355,1.6487,4.2169,4.5636,2.3377,0.2426,5.9236,0.5453,1.9368,1.0346,3.6778,1.4805,2.9436,3.6693,0.0971,3.8016,1.2504,2.3521,5.5565,2.5124,1.6903,0.1989,0.7508,0.6026,3.4441,2.8404,5.6679,0.919,0.7491,0.0004,3.5657,0.0023,0.0009,4.6436,3.5478,4.409,1.4194,1.6897,0.2271,0.1197,0.2413,1.2475,1.2458,0.1177,0.1075]}

{"id":253,"ended":true,"length":585,"gen_text":"You are able to edit, delete, and create your own memories at will.\n\nCreating your own memories is useful to those who are able to view your memories for more than 20 seconds. Many websites are also set up to make you think that you are really doing it right as your computer displays your own memory. You can make this simple right now.\n\nFirst and foremost, put a memory card in your memory-pane and draw a circle. This will give you easy access to the new memories you have created. The first picture will show all your old memory and the images you have stored in your old box will be easier to process. Then, create the new memory:\n\nMake your card by placing a note on the front edge of the box. The note will remind you of your new memory and will help you remember things in your old world. Select the Card Select your Card and press OK to go to the next layer of memory\n\nNow, open some of the other memory cards you have made. You can make any memory you like and make it feel very real to some degree. These can be found in the Memories app from your device. From there, you can put the memory to one of various applications, like, for playing music on your smartphone.\n\nThe Memory app is a little more complicated, however, the main advantage of Memory app is that every time you create the memory, it will remember your most recent memory that you made. As long as you open the memory, it will continue to collect old memories and use that memory as an option to add further memories to it. This can be a handy feature when you are studying, for example. I use my memory at my desk when I write down a lecture or a note that I gave to a lecture topic. Here's an example of playing a movie on my memory card:\n\nGo to the Memory app and paste the old memory into the Memory storage center. If you have installed Memory, you can start you new Memory app using the same settings as your existing Memcard app.\n\nIf you have configured the memory, you can create your own memory by having some open memory cards. Let the memory list reflect all the memory cards you have found. When you have created your memory, click Create New Memory\u2026 and press OK. Next, you now have to open the Memories library and open memory for you to recreate it.\n\nWhen you have created your memory, you can create some new memory memory for this app to use. You can use the new memory card only to create new memories after you have filled up more memory to create new memories. One of the more useful features of memory memory is that you can save your old memory so that there was enough time to recreate your new memory for the next day or two.\n\nIn this way, you can take a new new memory card and start a new computer for free and never worry about the memory you created when you used the old memory card.","token_len":609,"entropy":[3.8827,5.2005,0.0419,5.7205,3.743,2.8944,0.4243,1.7641,4.6032,2.7599,0.2368,8.0404,4.9435,2.2894,0.6857,1.4243,0.0004,5.4018,1.8011,0.2543,0.5944,1.4273,6.2099,2.595,3.6054,0.4249,1.8031,4.2173,0.0379,5.0653,1.8997,1.9901,3.9315,4.6492,0.6407,4.4755,1.6725,0.8014,5.3214,5.2328,3.6071,3.1708,5.1887,0.2288,0.4385,3.5408,3.184,4.6242,2.743,0.5053,0.9706,4.7339,3.4128,1.9212,2.9682,5.1964,3.6646,3.1308,4.4261,1.3311,3.9056,2.3058,0.7501,3.0247,0.6923,3.9858,2.1957,4.9346,6.5358,1.5586,1.8404,0.6005,0.0002,5.275,5.2433,0.0969,0.1659,6.3192,2.6337,3.8347,1.9391,0.8227,0.6352,4.367,5.5915,4.8703,1.0234,2.1028,5.3731,1.1916,2.1435,1.7552,2.4366,0.9301,3.4002,0.3529,6.6754,0.1007,0.0294,2.005,6.2373,1.2903,1.4048,1.363,0.4516,0.4265,3.3355,4.3456,3.614,1.8075,1.2808,3.4591,1.703,2.689,3.7502,3.2591,1.0248,5.9939,1.8022,1.0852,3.3886,1.3722,0.8729,4.5284,7.4165,0.8707,1.6007,5.0159,0.0631,6.0666,0.4624,3.6236,0.9854,3.8194,3.0128,0.8399,0.8613,5.7403,0.4421,0.0001,4.9362,3.3362,3.1457,5.5927,2.5975,1.7677,4.3379,1.6343,0.9452,3.8386,3.8286,0.1935,0.6108,3.8033,0.9858,2.9611,1.1106,0.6942,4.7957,0.0346,0.9902,1.1295,2.1192,0.6148,1.4649,1.6223,3.1813,0.2081,0.8408,3.0048,3.5219,1.7477,1.5138,5.2929,0.2562,5.6283,0.8451,5.9583,4.4556,2.4967,2.6581,3.4173,2.3491,3.2862,2.9101,4.2179,0.5598,0.6853,1.9722,6.0007,1.5191,1.2156,4.3766,0.0002,2.1102,0.7449,3.6851,7.0037,2.4687,0.495,3.4764,0.8144,1.0104,1.7704,0.4821,4.0099,1.0591,2.1603,1.3027,3.5057,3.1266,1.8446,0.8456,0.7753,2.4988,3.7947,1.0992,4.912,3.5847,2.4277,2.5754,5.999,1.763,0.2028,4.7981,3.8607,0.4661,4.0206,0.742,1.2637,5.538,4.1393,4.0026,1.6833,3.4018,0.659,5.7689,1.6383,0.2112,0.8456,0.0761,5.0085,2.3209,1.1276,4.5849,4.7461,0.4417,6.0592,3.3137,2.0824,1.3871,5.9754,1.3894,8.1391,2.4091,2.8887,0.6294,3.3853,1.8288,0.832,0.0002,3.0195,2.4777,1.3477,1.8682,1.8433,3.4087,1.6024,1.1597,2.3827,3.4292,1.1272,5.004,3.4102,3.2754,0.8722,3.1606,3.5367,0.2384,0.3939,6.2597,1.1366,0.1371,2.9157,4.1292,0.5173,0.6408,1.3504,0.9073,3.7332,2.3778,5.425,1.075,1.5303,4.7642,0.4717,1.5504,0.7183,4.6833,3.1824,0.0134,0.4253,4.3881,0.5698,1.1331,1.1077,1.2143,0.2124,4.6836,0.233,5.7998,5.2537,0.3949,1.933,3.9753,3.0433,0.3064,2.1712,3.2095,4.6181,1.1276,3.8438,6.5775,0.7783,1.4031,1.9335,0.1788,3.062,2.6096,0.4515,2.7649,4.7313,1.1917,2.2554,0.5688,1.2951,5.6065,2.0153,1.8006,0.1513,0.751,6.417,3.6823,2.9011,2.3359,5.521,2.4223,2.733,3.8233,0.2726,2.8528,2.9696,2.5459,4.8546,1.8004,2.404,3.9749,3.4098,0.312,5.4492,0.7369,1.1679,6.7498,6.1799,0.3851,5.8372,1.6177,1.0875,0.081,0.6603,6.6988,1.3814,4.5267,1.6831,0.2405,4.7377,0.6273,0.9832,0.0968,0.0002,5.0187,0.7254,0.6177,0.8721,0.6183,0.9249,5.6437,0.9583,4.7071,0.6147,1.6735,0.6747,1.3094,6.4221,5.9488,0.6061,3.8261,0.3799,2.0633,5.3404,1.4636,2.131,0.9797,0.5485,4.4288,5.9018,1.4874,2.4093,0.7892,3.4663,0.6415,3.6032,2.2342,1.4733,3.7187,3.6039,5.8669,3.7916,1.1577,0.2096,1.0659,0.0001,3.2841,0.1813,1.3628,5.6828,1.2786,1.5681,2.4851,0.8234,0.5958,3.3332,2.2979,0.5092,0.8037,1.9053,5.5479,4.101,5.3555,1.1809,1.7111,2.095,5.4645,3.4761,1.1703,6.1102,5.2674,2.6412,1.1434,0.9001,1.1918,0.7536,0.179,3.7428,1.3393,3.8726,0.2906,1.8051,1.7958,0.9281,1.2883,0.2568,3.3654,3.1644,4.5502,0.1209,6.5864,1.7368,3.6798,0.2853,0.7445,4.233,0.2503,1.6247,7.3252,0.3641,2.2087,2.6973,0.9581,4.3537,5.1928,1.9171,2.9014,4.628,3.2156,2.268,2.1726,5.7407,1.7953,0.3645,1.1024,0.0002,3.6436,0.1898,1.5711,0.6873,0.496,0.8657,0.1322,1.2086,0.4532,3.0516,4.6735,1.4824,1.259,4.7629,3.3356,5.0698,2.4191,3.7613,1.1115,1.1363,2.0435,0.2449,2.4935,1.4626,2.1784,0.0779,2.9823,4.9487,2.336,1.6337,0.6632,0.5903,5.3713,0.6458,0.6528,4.1331,2.5644,6.9018,0.3287,4.3655,1.3188,1.0622,0.5618,0.3676,5.6364,1.2867,0.0898,4.1318,1.9537,1.319,0.3877,2.8176,2.2438,0.7773,0.6536,1.0601,0.1209,3.6466,1.6304,1.3704,0.4924,4.259,0.6823,5.2572,5.2204,4.6009,1.7338,0.5992,3.1443,2.6958,1.064,0.1601,4.0637,2.3514,1.6627,4.4835,1.1295,0.8342,0.193,1.0528,0.0002,3.6691,2.2028,2.8749,0.1292,0.5348,0.2397,4.7311,2.0663,2.7176,6.7396,0.092,1.4204,0.9307,4.1755,2.8355,0.1065,5.9443,3.7919,2.9364,2.984,4.2476,3.3231,0.1152,2.5786,2.3317,2.8464,1.722,2.9549,0.1569,4.4991,1.7669,0.5319,0.5132,0.8612,0.3142]}

{"id":1382,"ended":true,"length":597,"gen_text":"You are sent back in time to an ancient civilization. Upon your arrival you are hailed as a god, and with you is an arsenal of modern technology and a loyal companion. What do you do?\n\nYour companion is a goddess. The goddess is a protector of the sun, who protects people. In short, you are the patron of those that love you and that are willing to help your journey through the harsh reaches of the underworld.\n\n. How do you feel before you first learn to love?\n\nBefore your arrival on the site, you must prepare for life on Earth. You were born in the universe itself, and have evolved to be more powerful than your ancestors who were raised in Earth. While you would probably have had better opportunities to study the environment with your kin before you entered the site you have long since found yourself with what appears to be a fairly simple set of questions and answers. One simple question was whether an ancient civilization can survive in this environment. The response came about after your mother had left Earth, and there you were living and breathing under a dome. The other questions of the day were if you could make it to the site in any way you wanted and if there was not enough money to set a clock. There are so many questions that your journey to this place needs to be understood in order to understand the various questions that this site also will ask you.\n\nIs there anything I cannot do for you. How do you make the best of your time?\n\nThere are several answers to these questions. The first thing is, If that isn't clear, there is plenty that can be done for this one human. Your companion and he or she will provide very little in regards to helping you get there. The second is, You must be a human in order for this site to work at all. That means that all you have to do is talk to people and ask them questions such as where they live. The third is, you must love those whom you share your love with. Are you a little too close to this one human and he or she is going to say? Will you leave or will he or she have something to say?\n\nWhile the question itself is so simple and the answers so clear they can be a little overwhelming you are still trying to do the important part. If you have tried to say, The day you get here is right and your heart should be racing and you think about being on the world's most famous city. That is what many of you are trying to do.

{"id":1013,"ended":true,"length":572,"gen_text":"The initials `` J.B. '' are legendary in espionage - James Bond, Jason Bourne, Jack Bauer. When they've all failed, you are sent to recruit the next candidate : Jack Black.\n\nIn one of the earliest known cases of espionage, KGB agents intercepted the conversation between James Bond and Giorgio Chinamieri, a Russian banker.\n\nWhen the KGB tried to recruit a lawyer, the agent decided to run.\n\nAnother case of espionage involved the arrest and interrogation of the son of a well-known Soviet officer. He was later put on trial and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nA CIA agent secretly infiltrated Russia's government with the use of a CIA mobile phone.\n\nA Russian official on a top official's phone told the court that a senior CIA officer had been arrested for espionage.\n\nWhen asked what he did after the phone was taken, the official replied: \"He called the CIA and told them that he wanted to 'kill' the agent and send 'one of these, two of that, whatever' about the agent.\n\n\"The CIA said that it didn't think that he might be the KGB agent. Later on, when the agent was not alive, he was a consultant who asked them about his background. Then he got very unhappy because he knew he was going to serve the KGB in Moscow.\" The CIA agent then told the court that he had \"tried to kill several'senior military officers' in the Moscow government.\"\n\nLater, on a tour of the Soviet Union in 1940, a CIA officer told the court, \"I don't know where I came from and I will only tell you my story because I'm very comfortable with it - my old CIA agent.\" The CIA officer said, \"He told me - 'I don't believe I know my place; I believe all the 'foreign intelligence services' I've heard'. \"\n\nThe Soviet government gave secret military intelligence to the CIA.\n\nWhen the CIA found out that a senior CIA officer had been arrested for espionage, it arrested two people.\n\nThese people, identified during the hearings as the CIA officers, were later arrested, imprisoned, and sentenced to death.\n\nOne of these three CIA officials gave the interrogator a copy of President Truman's autobiography about the early days of the Cold War. There he asked, \"Who is your favorite spy who betrayed you for your own protection?\" The interrogation technique the interrogator used to answer these questions ended with the person being cut off of their cell. A short time later, it was revealed that the CIA officer had been killed because someone from the American embassy in Moscow was suspected... a CIA lieutenant ordered that the man be shot so that more prisoners could escape the execution. One of the CIA officers was subsequently prosecuted for espionage for the same reason. (He also tried to convince other CIA officers, who included members of the Defense Intelligence Agency, that he was part of the Russians, to join him in committing spies).","token_len":611,"entropy":[12.454,7.8958,10.8362,1.7752,3.3196,0.0721,2.5239,1.3082,11.0949,1.8472,8.4925,7.786,7.2076,1.4525,2.0493,7.9556,0.3524,0.0004,0.4486,4.4678,3.419,1.9601,5.3364,3.2371,5.5865,3.6391,6.1247,0.7796,4.3477,5.4563,6.6914,0.8833,8.2532,2.2479,1.3268,7.3904,10.7407,5.4551,6.4416,1.3374,2.3555,0.1409,3.2034,4.4901,0.7493,0.6579,3.5493,5.3026,2.5091,0.7022,1.6163,0.4857,5.9886,1.2296,5.299,2.0025,5.4277,0.5426,3.0321,0.0775,0.1543,5.7795,3.3952,0.1243,5.1606,5.185,3.4785,0.9004,1.7651,3.2974,3.6518,1.5292,3.1674,0.0004,4.0103,1.5845,1.9101,3.9055,0.0614,2.9078,2.2746,5.3377,1.7814,1.7954,2.403,5.1595,0.3996,4.937,2.553,1.5057,0.0003,5.4037,1.9503,1.6928,0.277,1.5521,1.4333,4.7285,2.8774,1.4412,0.03,2.7162,4.3486,0.0647,1.1018,5.7616,0.1174,0.1686,2.5155,4.6654,0.9925,3.3274,0.5736,4.1055,4.01,0.9992,0.5797,2.8197,1.6082,0.0363,1.944,0.7216,0.4519,0.3053,0.0003,3.4488,4.2798,1.1683,5.8827,4.2641,6.3109,0.637,4.2358,3.6415,1.2853,5.8734,0.0008,1.5096,3.1973,5.4488,0.4741,0.8235,0.7456,0.0002,2.4063,3.7197,4.385,5.8314,1.4051,5.6234,4.1752,0.4415,3.9877,4.0899,1.3367,5.6242,0.6524,2.5434,3.3574,2.6825,1.7576,1.7669,2.3075,3.0104,1.7637,1.9851,1.0773,0.6086,0.0002,3.6931,4.2551,2.5247,1.2528,2.9114,2.9995,1.624,3.342,1.1789,3.0744,0.7347,0.6758,1.3112,1.0397,1.4719,0.8127,3.6287,4.2401,1.8184,2.181,1.5418,1.8426,0.3006,1.6926,1.3256,2.2767,0.3605,5.8113,4.5111,1.6582,1.3066,4.4505,2.3044,4.3554,5.306,4.1862,1.276,3.1848,5.1428,2.3644,1.1707,4.0892,1.4838,5.8255,1.9353,5.4456,1.9528,2.7085,1.8365,1.734,0.0002,0.7401,1.7088,0.9505,2.9053,1.7541,2.2223,2.9043,0.0007,3.0621,1.6805,2.0767,5.0316,1.0735,3.2768,6.267,0.5386,1.4565,6.6023,2.6247,0.4658,2.2063,1.5312,2.4628,1.1964,5.1797,4.5421,0.2322,0.845,1.7028,5.7863,5.6142,3.8622,5.2171,2.9167,3.3772,2.5849,5.0362,1.0614,4.204,0.9779,3.6752,5.3383,5.3377,3.5765,0.5659,3.9112,2.3072,0.8063,2.2772,0.0287,7.235,2.3088,0.8529,3.1175,2.899,1.347,5.5934,1.5036,2.2056,3.5972,2.4842,0.3406,0.2448,0.5751,0.6463,1.6287,3.5881,4.1819,1.1039,0.3486,1.7915,5.4914,9.8196,12.3038,7.1125,7.7358,1.6948,5.3737,4.2842,1.4881,4.0541,3.9289,1.9583,0.3949,0.0003,5.2924,0.7971,3.9174,1.8163,5.178,0.2695,0.9002,2.0583,0.5259,2.8236,5.078,0.1693,2.4904,1.5441,1.332,2.5179,0.4543,0.1426,3.2598,0.2366,1.1492,4.1068,0.0015,1.0965,3.3905,1.6768,3.2682,0.0923,3.3642,1.3668,5.7721,5.0453,1.0743,0.3103,3.1372,2.2631,2.1203,0.7506,3.4251,3.3046,5.4542,0.9387,1.1162,4.6501,4.357,5.8316,3.2892,2.131,2.6012,1.9999,0.6183,1.1823,2.0239,2.3247,0.0557,2.3784,2.2569,0.2155,5.9308,2.2372,1.5845,2.6158,0.0008,3.8341,3.3376,3.9425,5.6055,3.2697,5.0828,0.5274,3.3361,5.4675,1.5239,6.2798,5.606,3.191,1.1725,0.6254,4.5827,1.5336,2.8482,5.8558,2.7535,0.529,0.0003,1.6052,4.2585,1.7912,5.1981,5.9079,4.5191,2.569,0.8454,0.4648,0.9336,1.4325,0.9472,0.0002,3.1778,0.8853,1.1848,5.1679,0.3573,0.7818,2.1303,3.1371,1.8491,0.5183,0.7053,0.3178,0.7737,0.5098,0.2475,0.2005,1.2406,4.1575,4.0917,3.8897,1.8563,0.8347,0.0003,5.5848,2.343,2.5468,4.2574,7.5097,0.6994,4.878,0.7362,2.1576,2.8491,2.6716,1.0606,0.347,3.116,2.8307,3.2033,3.4322,1.4568,0.4004,3.3929,0.02,1.4616,0.3756,0.266,0.0003,3.621,0.3485,1.1215,5.0253,2.4394,3.3754,6.6637,1.3411,5.731,1.224,1.1724,2.994,0.0055,4.9956,2.431,0.0111,4.2007,4.2472,0.9982,5.0888,0.652,0.058,0.2552,1.5207,0.0007,0.413,6.717,2.2792,3.8478,1.6884,0.1138,3.2136,1.4793,2.6487,3.7146,2.8083,4.6762,5.4041,1.5258,4.7256,2.072,1.189,4.5233,0.488,1.8835,3.8738,4.6352,4.6782,1.8137,0.0303,0.5826,2.6166,3.1772,3.356,0.0683,6.632,2.1701,0.641,3.8439,0.4945,5.0929,0.952,3.9377,2.5934,2.1393,1.0943,5.2,4.474,0.2178,0.0515,0.2354,4.7778,0.3167,0.9658,0.1651,0.7355,0.9312,1.4929,0.9068,1.0273,3.4496,4.7455,6.6221,5.283,0.5095,4.4977,3.0723,0.8625,0.1599,2.4197,5.1946,8.9162,5.7335,2.5961,6.6761,5.5216,3.0293,0.6221,2.6972,0.4864,3.0534,4.4456,0.9398,7.0221,4.4345,0.7661,3.3129,2.7421,4.7391,1.4358,5.2089,0.6538,0.2653,1.5841,0.4721,1.788,4.4303,5.4113,0.8775,1.2522,2.4381,1.6835,2.164,1.1643,0.55,4.4177,5.3803,3.8945,4.4354,0.1289,4.4837,4.7891,1.3776,0.2458,3.2324,1.9989,6.0086,5.046,0.014,0.4366,5.5202,0.0732,0.0354,0.3401,1.0985,1.024,0.5879,4.9044,0.0037,0.7538,5.4861,2.8443,3.175,3.1305,1.2743,0.55,4.0473,6.305,4.0982]}

{"id":4601,"ended":false,"length":545,"gen_text":"You wake up one morning in an almost identical universe where the only significant difference is that nothing has names, and things instead are described at the time literally by their function. Walk us through your first few hours!\n\nYour first day in the real world\n\n\nIt's the day you start to dream.\n\nWith all due respect, I never thought it'd actually happen to you. I think a lot of people might think that it has.\n\nBut it does \u2014 and it does not and is not so.\n\nIt is a very good, very early step toward a better relationship with reality, and the biggest mistake people make when they try to go with what has been set up.\n\nI don't know why I would want to be a therapist. If I did, the fact of the matter would be that I had no motivation to learn, and I would be afraid to do it anyway.\n\nInstead, I'm simply a natural person who really cares about what is and is not what.\n\nI can never go back.\n\nWhat I'm doing right now...\n\nI'm doing it with care. It is the difference in me being able to live a life that I can live with my real life instead of being the one who sees your life from an entirely different perspective.\n\nTo help give you the feel of this, I will set up an introductory course to help you get started with working with this.\n\nYou can find this course on google.\n\nIf you want the same content over and over again, or even more, as you find it through email, you will enjoy the full course and will only be limited by the amount of content you will be using.\n\nThis is also the ONLY introductory class on what to do in a relationship. I won't cover any other issues; I won't talk about any specific subject matter I am not aware of. So, just enjoy the course.\n\nAlso read:\n\nHow To Become a Parent & Grow Up.

{"id":1374,"ended":true,"length":584,"gen_text":"SatChat : Are you working on a book? Why or why not?\n\nNordy : Hello. I just want to bring this up to you today because in my experience writing most websites I feel I need to make a new book to start with, not a new book I might start on. I'm using the internet for personal blogs and things so I'm actually doing my best.\n\nI have been interested in programming since I was a kid and it helped me to focus on writing because I have so many things to write so I read and I can share the knowledge and I know I'm getting better at it since I've been with this book. I read through it for weeks or months at a time and found the things I can do to get away with it really helped me with the problems I face and I want to make your work easier and help you build your confidence. As far as I can tell I'm not the only one who has been so happy with the book so I'm glad you found it!\n\n\nIt also helps to have a feel for what to expect whenever I visit a site and if you are new to your journey you might be able to use the new search function instead of searching all your sites! There will still be great information available so hopefully this will prove useful for you and you too!\n\n\nThank you so much for trying out my book and please take my word that you will definitely make a difference at the end of this week!\n\nDave\n\n\nReply to this post edit] Poster: dave Originally Posted by\n\nI also think it is a great idea. The first issue you mentioned is in the second issue I should mention I haven't written a book yet yet in the least. I hope I am up to my speed and my book covers things that are often ignored by people.\n\nIt seems the second issue starts off with two of the same topics where the tone changes and with the addition of the book's cover by Paul Clements. The first issue is something that could help you to get some understanding at a given point in the story and it is very important that you make sure you understand that.\n\nWhen you're done reading the page you can put on a book cover. That is important to have in your arsenal and if that has a real effect on your project it will help to give you a better idea about what you are trying to accomplish.\n\nThe second issue is something that appears to be missing for this project since I think that the cover by Paul Clements is too similar to that which Paul and I have written together to present our book. One of my favorite things to note about this issue is that we have written an introduction which is a big deal to me because we've written it this way for several years now.\n\n\nHope this helps you with the book, it's been awhile since I've written a book so hopefully there are some things you can use to add to it once you have that in your hands.","token_len":612,"entropy":[11.5031,6.7244,6.7428,0.2862,4.8154,0.2605,1.392,6.3965,2.0372,5.9982,4.5666,0.3079,0.0093,0.5408,1.0635,0.0026,4.7246,5.1211,5.1675,0.6913,5.9098,2.2657,1.0481,3.5582,2.0823,0.0716,5.6916,2.6329,0.6657,2.022,0.7677,6.1788,2.9492,4.886,1.7264,3.134,3.4819,5.6965,6.1484,3.0994,4.6507,3.5917,1.9051,0.3014,3.2538,1.9166,4.7917,2.3238,3.0988,3.7349,1.3932,2.5488,3.996,3.0933,1.3397,1.9593,2.5149,5.8936,3.147,2.9121,1.0382,1.3833,2.0981,5.2494,2.2264,4.7948,1.9579,4.8282,4.9363,1.2829,5.0091,3.4811,0.6382,1.659,5.3905,3.5638,2.806,1.0036,2.9538,1.6681,0.0001,2.4681,3.216,2.4597,5.0826,0.071,5.8963,1.0929,0.4864,0.0448,1.0962,0.6035,1.2282,3.3194,4.7934,0.2779,1.9366,4.665,0.6925,2.6123,3.8317,0.8168,4.2308,3.1765,0.889,2.1725,1.089,2.2546,5.2726,0.6191,5.7563,2.3993,2.2462,2.9113,5.1904,3.9166,1.6805,2.3023,2.6714,3.3606,1.889,1.7084,3.3474,1.0735,1.0945,0.609,6.5472,0.493,1.8938,1.2675,4.9796,2.5775,3.3528,1.0552,1.4611,4.3334,4.2168,1.8354,3.9599,4.5529,4.1603,0.3621,4.2341,0.0385,0.0098,0.7916,5.2637,3.0618,4.3363,0.6968,4.8566,1.0776,1.6017,2.0366,6.2473,2.1493,1.8581,4.2716,2.2221,0.3611,3.77,2.4641,4.2723,0.6829,3.0558,2.3114,1.0942,3.9428,0.2002,2.6361,7.0255,4.124,2.4146,3.0592,3.1284,0.5545,5.3887,1.971,3.3796,0.8996,5.4977,2.5575,0.005,2.1178,1.9672,0.2917,2.099,1.3865,1.8685,3.4633,0.9705,0.357,0.9947,1.4296,1.6382,5.8783,3.6547,0.6828,1.4869,1.7148,2.3921,1.1997,1.2605,2.9218,1.0313,3.5869,0.3934,4.8803,4.0157,0.0003,4.7132,4.3201,1.5651,1.9921,1.741,0.9431,5.3327,0.1455,1.7015,3.6757,1.3071,6.2619,1.9103,5.86,1.7598,1.5101,1.7063,3.2456,1.975,2.3862,3.3334,0.2689,5.4739,5.5228,2.914,1.9356,1.8376,1.6748,0.0152,3.7033,1.6088,4.8058,4.9417,2.1338,5.5592,0.3858,2.844,4.4932,3.3688,1.9752,4.4511,5.0567,3.6255,3.911,0.033,5.9976,3.5747,2.1967,3.6317,5.3094,1.778,1.0427,6.3957,0.8641,1.2874,0.4868,2.3563,2.3293,2.1907,0.6481,1.2671,0.0003,2.8125,0.0307,1.6285,0.0199,0.3845,6.1149,1.4991,2.2839,1.8607,1.438,3.7869,3.4644,3.7773,1.2241,1.9479,2.01,1.7622,4.6759,2.9602,0.8497,0.4412,5.2013,2.2504,0.8335,0.2342,1.7779,3.7819,1.1815,1.412,0.0002,7.6129,2.9684,0.0004,4.7383,3.0931,0.1765,0.203,0.0182,0.0011,0.0006,0.0001,5.4175,1.4812,4.1355,0.1002,0.0005,2.7151,0.0001,1.8376,3.7694,3.7194,1.6461,2.1546,1.7747,1.0902,1.2556,2.3992,3.4503,3.4352,4.8426,3.4587,3.2156,1.5567,4.7424,1.084,3.9576,1.863,4.47,5.2757,1.4305,3.4662,4.0891,0.0019,3.6204,1.3111,0.9008,1.1356,4.5643,4.9055,1.9842,4.2471,0.9578,1.2589,3.8518,2.6203,2.5755,5.4694,0.2022,3.9646,6.0787,1.7275,4.9661,2.9605,5.7795,4.3063,1.5203,2.0238,5.5843,3.6512,1.8651,2.657,1.3507,2.1544,0.0002,3.5712,3.3968,3.6791,3.1113,0.1899,6.0961,1.6688,1.4224,5.0586,4.0216,0.69,4.4095,3.3687,5.4138,2.3333,5.9451,3.4938,1.8876,5.7062,1.2633,4.8508,0.0122,1.838,4.8863,3.4938,3.7331,4.7466,5.6657,5.0058,3.6559,0.7993,2.4827,1.188,1.5373,1.4925,6.0133,0.9873,5.7374,4.1192,1.6138,2.3666,1.9644,3.6071,3.7891,5.5491,1.8913,5.1478,0.8308,1.1597,2.1751,1.3489,1.6463,2.9957,1.7438,3.4989,1.7554,1.5995,0.2826,4.5956,1.2946,0.813,2.0796,3.1356,1.9864,1.6758,0.0002,4.7527,1.3009,3.7555,3.4976,2.0532,1.2955,5.5882,1.4545,1.8261,4.4235,2.3302,2.1287,2.2629,1.4334,2.9672,3.8933,2.2488,4.0599,2.1247,3.2209,2.4971,1.0919,4.4703,1.9432,2.556,4.5556,5.0903,3.3102,5.3545,1.9863,0.3714,1.0926,5.3125,2.5242,1.707,1.2312,2.5013,4.1895,0.3153,0.9732,2.0105,0.7314,3.273,0.6104,1.3097,1.4636,2.2915,0.0147,0.5549,0.6409,0.9704,0.0002,2.3415,0.6437,0.1031,1.058,1.7226,0.4466,6.2624,1.2134,0.59,3.2376,4.4223,4.6697,3.2248,5.3769,1.442,3.2606,2.4655,2.1939,2.4149,3.3807,0.4926,0.2021,0.0002,1.1288,3.1522,3.7489,0.2396,3.8793,3.2936,3.8392,4.7889,0.6898,1.685,1.9681,3.5616,4.3372,5.9989,4.118,2.6036,0.857,5.7172,1.0073,1.9629,1.8078,0.8164,2.2092,6.2841,1.2568,0.8046,1.1911,0.1916,0.4549,3.4693,1.7949,2.7284,3.8103,2.6709,2.9067,1.3065,2.6693,4.7236,2.0651,1.8519,1.3523,2.3314,2.471,3.5264,1.6927,2.4951,4.9861,0.3539,1.5295,4.3875,0.4262,1.0775,1.0235,2.8811,0.0002,5.0769,0.8698,0.3265,2.1506,2.9629,2.0257,2.1684,3.5293,3.5466,1.2974,1.9717,6.1311,0.6756,0.3332,1.0554,1.2293,0.6547,0.1299,2.0896,3.1722,4.6187,1.907,1.2817,1.7696,1.3619,1.1367,3.3431,1.106,4.3444,0.6693,2.1973,5.8321,0.5818,1.4984,4.1228,3.5069,0.4764,2.6407,0.3814]}
{"id":3863,"ended":true,"length":557,"gen_text":"They've discovered something, contained in the last breath of every animal that breathes... and has in its DNA the characteristic of the first degree of insanity\n\n'The study of animals is extremely valuable,' says Dr Martin.\n\nThe study involved collecting samples from the human brain, and also using samples from 'feral' fish and mammals \u2014 fish with certain characteristics and characteristics of the species.\n\nThese animals included fish, reptiles, birds, human and other birds.\n\nAnd the new study suggests that the 'bio-physical' features of the humans are the main reason why we humans are mentally and physically more dangerous than most species with which we share common bloodlines, including:\n\nA person with schizophrenia might have more similarities with the brains of rats and apes living in large environments but less resemblance to its brains of other species\n\nThe results show that the 'brain' and 'vascular' features of humans differ greatly between humans who have been living in their very physical environments and those who live in animals \u2014 not in any way resembling their 'human' brains from the perspective of the study authors who described themselves as 'physically-minded'.\n\n'These studies are the first to give the first evidence that this characteristic also goes hand in hand with the way our brains function,' said Dr Martin.\n\n'Brain functions go hand in hand with how we perceive the world. We may think of it in terms of a perception that the world is our 'own' world and we are the kind of human.\n\n'Our brains function as an instrument to interpret reality - and, therefore, can play a crucial role in interpreting our own reality - in this case, with an eye to detail.'\n\nDr Martin added: 'Even in animal models of mental processes, such as in humans, our 'psychic' features make them so special, because we have different neurological structures.\n\n'To have this effect, we need to understand the biology of these features - what is the biological mechanism by which they are used - their function in humans, and how this mechanism operates within the human brain.\n\n'What we will do now is examine these brains in more detail, and show whether these features can be linked to their biological role.'\n\nDr Martin said that previous research has proven that a lack of cerebral spinal cord is likely to lead to increased risk of dementia over time.\n\nBut she added: 'We don't know. It appears to depend on people who are very aware that they have cerebral spinal cord injuries.\n\n'There seem to be a number of hypotheses, but we need better evidence to make any causal claims. We know, for instance, that there is an increase in the risk of Alzheimer's in people who don't have this disorder (as suggested by these results)\n\n'As with the biological mechanism, our findings suggest a link between brain damage and dementia, but not between the effects of brain injury and cognitive functioning, or even the effects of dementia.","token_len":613,"entropy":[5.6462,7.005,4.6841,3.6756,11.0561,1.7429,1.1757,5.3696,7.1916,0.6815,4.6325,5.7533,2.3632,5.5221,0.0022,6.168,2.9484,4.6221,6.3811,2.7292,4.3004,2.2096,6.0797,3.1298,2.319,4.6245,6.2835,1.7188,4.0496,6.1601,0.0029,3.895,2.5897,5.9547,2.3841,3.1749,2.2796,4.4852,4.1226,2.9066,1.6996,1.6079,5.5187,2.1282,1.3535,0.0005,2.3695,2.5286,4.1561,5.3465,2.0439,0.7068,3.0442,4.5756,2.5082,1.1996,2.4412,4.1324,3.7553,5.5967,0.3896,6.4017,4.6729,2.732,0.5581,5.8866,1.9646,2.8238,8.2547,4.1069,2.4439,5.4863,2.3667,3.2308,2.2847,1.3179,1.2282,3.3363,1.8727,0.1595,0.0003,4.518,1.73,4.0516,3.6273,1.2944,3.8788,0.3898,1.6713,0.4266,6.4857,1.4875,2.7014,4.6669,1.0048,0.2198,0.0003,4.3928,2.1305,5.4878,1.6977,3.4058,0.4743,1.4947,3.4755,5.1888,2.8642,0.9515,5.8249,0.6438,3.461,0.6128,1.067,5.3159,1.9023,2.9246,3.7388,1.9408,0.6238,2.4028,2.886,1.3097,5.9058,2.8986,0.3709,3.1072,2.4227,0.5402,3.8911,3.439,6.6436,2.4929,0.2564,1.7607,2.2467,3.34,1.0053,2.6976,4.0581,5.5615,0.3634,0.0001,3.7004,4.0585,1.4321,1.9904,4.3516,1.3312,3.5626,4.7269,1.1612,1.5248,3.347,0.0684,4.3771,1.5699,3.8443,7.3188,0.4601,6.2533,5.0325,5.1588,3.6762,3.3653,0.4918,6.6854,0.9668,0.5969,2.5095,1.8908,0.6372,0.0002,2.3868,4.421,3.1667,0.2433,1.3522,2.7724,2.2045,2.2224,4.3599,0.6353,5.2055,1.3226,0.6724,1.3104,0.2796,2.3703,3.8368,3.3751,2.6051,2.8752,5.3698,1.489,3.3712,2.6866,0.9345,4.597,5.6291,4.3709,2.3078,0.9169,0.6432,0.8666,2.2094,0.3752,4.6231,4.1963,3.8765,4.4883,3.5076,1.3259,2.4628,1.4939,4.4803,3.6254,0.2627,0.7011,6.1203,1.7449,3.8276,0.0256,1.7363,2.5252,4.0446,5.0211,4.9918,3.6827,0.1818,0.9801,4.5007,1.0125,4.3664,4.1457,1.6412,0.1487,0.0002,2.2138,3.3902,4.7421,2.4661,2.3488,0.3347,0.9127,5.4401,3.0308,2.6721,2.1691,0.6614,4.2634,5.0199,6.6591,4.6103,1.1506,0.3161,0.0041,0.0169,1.063,5.4358,2.4732,0.5882,2.5817,1.1807,2.2321,0.3068,0.1869,0.1475,0.2539,0.0003,0.7807,5.2401,4.0685,5.65,0.0568,0.064,0.001,0.0421,2.7334,0.95,2.4321,1.7902,0.1152,1.538,2.5477,3.7782,2.2807,1.0604,2.6501,4.1084,0.3247,0.0045,3.0409,5.6428,3.2016,3.421,0.6566,0.4343,3.7517,4.3602,3.4613,0.8171,2.7887,2.3442,2.2087,2.7258,3.5373,6.0355,0.114,3.6231,3.0654,0.4769,0.0002,0.1237,3.2203,0.9112,2.4597,2.7913,3.1753,4.1232,1.803,3.4996,2.7356,5.6639,2.7724,4.0718,2.7724,0.0068,4.4895,4.4781,0.3753,2.9669,0.0859,0.0716,3.918,2.2113,1.4425,2.0405,2.7073,3.1304,2.541,1.3659,0.8481,4.811,3.9668,1.8922,1.4463,4.4106,1.0081,0.2269,0.0003,1.88,0.0899,2.0438,0.4192,0.01,5.7958,2.7911,4.2859,2.4631,1.611,1.779,5.06,0.4088,3.3433,0.0083,2.914,1.4065,0.1732,3.2204,3.695,4.6503,1.7557,0.2071,1.8572,5.1885,3.3246,4.8263,5.29,2.8594,3.4851,2.2354,1.9681,3.6633,5.2673,2.9142,1.6636,0.2276,0.0003,0.0579,4.3807,3.475,2.5596,3.9957,0.991,0.7904,0.9394,0.2651,1.4901,1.5983,4.2608,0.3694,3.0464,2.4468,3.5378,3.3349,2.3366,1.3747,2.9901,3.1573,1.9924,0.0005,0.9472,1.6055,4.1204,3.1051,5.8206,3.2191,1.5857,2.6997,0.879,0.6511,1.1313,2.9631,4.5005,3.6764,3.1985,1.2244,1.9769,0.5099,0.9621,0.1352,0.0002,0.0669,4.1807,0.7849,4.1718,2.5244,1.8549,0.1625,3.9428,3.2414,5.4734,1.9083,2.1003,0.037,1.3405,1.039,4.2413,3.8763,2.2682,2.0974,2.8321,0.5563,3.3821,0.5773,4.2868,2.5183,2.9503,2.1898,0.4682,0.0003,1.9069,0.133,1.7935,1.3392,5.536,1.2246,1.6731,6.4147,0.2093,3.8131,4.7641,0.0024,5.5789,4.9872,0.3544,2.8206,5.4025,0.5485,1.9214,0.0475,3.7002,0.6343,0.2766,2.9915,6.2797,0.8353,0.6359,0.2318,0.0002,3.4368,5.605,0.8115,0.2692,0.0038,2.1802,3.2887,0.0008,0.5896,4.9016,2.1812,4.9307,1.7012,3.7822,0.2688,6.2991,3.2828,1.2826,3.1228,4.7102,3.1496,1.2024,1.2829,2.4839,0.3364,0.0453,1.7628,1.1642,0.2662,0.0002,0.0739,3.2707,6.2078,0.0083,0.0205,1.961,1.4936,0.0041,3.8278,2.5247,1.2599,2.2511,3.3926,6.0005,1.3344,1.168,2.6692,2.6724,4.3833,5.318,1.3326,2.8895,3.3722,3.4937,0.5271,1.3778,0.0332,0.084,3.149,0.6076,2.237,2.4568,0.0477,1.3581,0.7215,0.0655,1.5605,0.0273,2.7101,1.1767,0.8578,4.313,0.0007,0.29,3.2637,3.338,5.2949,4.0051,4.1067,0.214,4.3608,1.8804,0.8134,2.027,0.0002,0.289,4.6954,2.9967,2.7245,5.9229,1.9274,1.2121,3.4468,1.5914,2.151,3.8627,2.2013,0.1166,2.4361,2.4648,0.2075,1.4193,1.6764,1.4436,2.9902,1.1727,1.8696,4.0748,0.061,2.3992,1.0508,0.2621,2.7852,4.4306,2.9065,2.1267,2.3177,2.1463,2.5269,0.0366,3.2477,1.564]}
{"id":4983,"ended":true,"length":551,"gen_text":"Moments before a battle, a warrior reflects on his life as he prepares for war.\n\nAura faint transmutation; CL 1st; Weight \u2014; Aura faint\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nThis rare light bulb has a bright light that emanates from it as part of a cosmic dance. As part of the cosmic dance, the bearer gains the following benefits and gains resistance to acid, fire, cold, electricity and darkness for 30 minutes at 1st level, and half again at 8th level, after being struck by an acid strike (for a total of +10 hit points; see Stone Dance):\n\nEach creature who is adjacent with him or the bearer of that hit may use this ability at will. As a full-round action while in the cosmic dance, the bearer can activate the ability without taking any action but instead using the Astral Weapon feature and moving his hand up to its full, and not taking a Constitution saving throw.\n\nA warrior may use his psychic abilities as if he were wearing no armor or carrying no spellbooks at all. A warrior's powers are not negated, however, and if the bearer uses a Psychic ability to cause an attempt to use his psychic powers to fail, the failure succeeds. The psychic abilities (such as the Psychic Strike and Psykics of Power or Psychic Focus) increase the fighter's AC and damage defense.\n\nAwar's Powers\n\nAwar must hold an aura. The aura is equal to the warrior's Strength modifier. The aura grants 1\/2 his charisma and he gains 1\/2 his Constitution modifier per base he has above 20. The aura is centered on you, and whenever a warrior gains a level in an aura, his attack roll with the aura is a Constitution saving throw. Awar's Aura is manifested in two different ways. The first is a sphere of dark energy with a radius of 1 inch, at the bottom of the circle where the light comes from, when you are about 25 feet away from you that will become an aura. The second means a spellcaster of your ability can see into the light and the aura will deal damage of the form of a ray of light (see Stone Arrow, page 11).

The aliens are also known by the same name, \"The Old Ones,\" for example.","token_len":613,"entropy":[10.8165,6.7437,4.1649,6.1267,9.1787,2.1313,2.0339,0.1631,1.5579,4.5055,2.3751,1.5335,9.9435,7.8871,7.9575,3.5003,0.8407,1.9241,0.0071,7.5033,2.6072,0.9688,6.1251,1.9494,6.503,5.1814,3.1056,1.656,5.6245,0.615,1.0598,4.815,1.3514,3.0706,3.9901,1.5031,0.4259,0.9906,0.4367,0.0121,0.6368,0.7612,0.0003,1.7804,0.6059,1.3889,1.0866,0.3656,0.0965,3.9233,2.4811,5.9501,0.1057,0.0629,0.0168,0.4543,0.6109,0.8516,0.3367,0.0294,4.2483,2.9563,3.1814,5.2693,0.4105,6.147,6.0303,0.0004,0.4393,0.241,5.7765,3.9478,2.8692,5.2896,1.124,5.7593,0.5911,4.0899,1.5952,4.7124,5.1301,0.8492,3.3794,2.8303,1.0484,5.5082,0.0007,0.1589,2.0424,1.1866,3.7582,5.469,5.3945,0.951,4.6251,2.922,3.0435,0.0028,3.8995,2.9093,0.0001,0.0003,1.8726,2.9744,0.9259,5.4171,4.7785,0.8399,1.1459,3.0356,0.9262,1.9042,5.2857,4.0975,2.1702,4.0787,2.4789,5.4419,2.564,0.0057,0.0004,5.4038,2.3145,4.2879,0.7115,1.8682,2.9364,1.5385,6.402,0.5145,0.0004,5.7158,1.9862,6.1207,1.3467,3.7717,2.1232,0.4923,4.9247,5.5081,2.2798,0.0296,5.4187,0.2251,0.3093,5.9505,3.1147,2.6868,3.6852,1.9366,3.5663,2.5107,0.9755,3.6144,2.3786,4.3764,5.0716,3.6549,0.2701,2.0328,5.7249,1.0045,5.5566,2.3812,0.0024,4.7242,4.2136,2.4381,6.8002,4.9557,1.8832,1.9346,5.9058,0.6484,3.0549,0.6872,2.6198,3.4153,2.4444,0.7796,4.9863,4.601,4.1042,0.4453,4.3272,4.1146,0.2604,5.3523,2.9939,3.7093,1.8864,3.8892,2.0676,1.6211,2.3399,2.0557,5.1306,3.7094,3.8338,1.0713,0.8492,0.2564,1.3152,4.2304,2.1873,4.9841,0.0008,3.1235,0.6251,1.1437,3.9645,4.0282,0.0308,0.0171,4.789,5.0118,5.0105,3.4525,1.6967,4.0377,0.5867,4.1687,5.4733,0.3068,0.4484,0.0003,2.9799,2.6796,0.0048,0.012,0.0039,0.0002,0.0151,0.0008,0.0011,0.0006,0.0009,0.0056,0.0093,0.0135,0.004,0.0022,0.0093,0.0047,0.0323,5.8037,0.0082,0.0061,0.0002,0.0184,0.0018,0.0011,0.0128,0.0026,0.0008,0.0012,0.0125,0.0027,0.0008,0.0048,0.0012,0.0018,0.0139,0.0046,0.0011,0.002,0.011,0.0018,0.0012,0.0027,0.0004,0.1809,0.001,1.4942,0.0069,0.0053,0.0042,0.005,0.0017,0.009,0.1693,0.0701,0.0335,0.0058,0.007,0.0015,0.0068,0.0013,0.0016,0.0006,0.0021,0.0001,0.0081,0.0017,0.0006,0.0021,0.035,0.0021,0.0033,0.0081,0.002,0.0005,0.0136,0.002,0.0005,0.0007,0.0002,0.0021,0.0009,1.0443,2.1856,1.3917,1.7493,0.7945,2.4674,0.4658,6.2252,1.7612,1.5835,2.8718,2.6692,5.27,0.0608,3.0189,0.8689,4.8574,1.1343,5.9746,6.8709,4.4713,0.8834,4.4887,0.0484,0.9233,6.1079,3.106,2.226,5.2435,4.0337,2.2183,3.8573,3.9735,0.9861,5.5839,6.3978,0.7112,4.3051,1.5349,1.9938,1.5352,5.4318,2.2159,1.4254,1.5927,1.6091,0.203,2.1239,4.7084,0.359,3.5179,1.0441,0.2983,0.0002,2.1455,2.2332,0.0029,0.0039,0.0017,0.0015,0.0021,0.0011,0.0081,0.0039,0.0024,0.0025,0.0021,0.0006,0.0017,0.0007,0.5005,1.8404,0.7319,0.1078,4.6596,4.5368,0.1182,1.5944,3.0819,2.636,4.8964,3.4781,1.1107,0.0265,0.3564,5.8758,2.2133,0.9123,0.0002,1.0329,0.0153,0.0067,0.0023,0.0033,0.0024,0.0419,0.0188,0.0018,0.0014,0.0009,0.0045,0.0009,7.1531,0.9561,0.8887,1.6929,0.0002,0.0013,3.2365,4.6518,1.6987,4.2902,2.7332,4.2772,2.2045,3.1368,2.1535,2.6868,4.7551,0.0705,3.2505,1.2169,5.1851,4.993,0.4356,4.6148,0.9207,1.4582,1.2017,5.6358,4.4071,4.3022,2.6245,0.001,3.3898,6.1246,1.6891,0.1413,6.0121,0.1517,3.9495,4.3137,1.4419,2.8473,0.2717,2.5507,1.4168,2.8769,4.7238,0.1507,2.5513,3.8676,4.0719,1.8786,2.8152,1.1598,5.4125,3.9705,4.0242,1.1878,2.1226,0.5295,1.8109,0.6503,5.0398,0.8904,8.2387,5.7515,3.0743,2.8437,0.5755,3.1757,4.0352,1.5066,2.2095,0.5929,0.3154,0.0002,3.9907,0.0552,0.0011,0.0016,0.0132,0.0025,0.0021,0.0152,0.0021,0.2617,0.0004,0.0006,0.0023,0.0071,0.0046,0.0011,0.0003,0.0015,0.0004,0.0011,0.0081,0.0041,0.001,0.0007,0.0173,0.0026,0.0025,0.0026,0.0042,0.0006,0.0001,0.0001,0.004,0.0193,0.0022,0.0217,0.1484,0.003,0.0004,0.0048,0.0003,0.0005,0.0025,0.0019,0.0007,0.0008,0.0016,0.0026,0.0307,0.0052,0.0006,0.0018,0.0108,0.0013,0.0174,0.0013,0.0015,0.0151,0.0045,0.0005,0.0083,0.0027,0.0015,0.0007,0.0023,0.0016,0.0013,0.0007,3.2025,0.4152,0.244,3.3469,3.3906,1.0152,1.635,0.6501,2.6869,5.8806,4.5252,1.8979,4.4915,0.8995,1.5794,4.8811,4.0685,0.5619,1.3922,3.6337,2.0429,1.5033,2.1344,4.6305,1.0109,0.7894,0.0002,4.0237,1.0248,3.6406,4.0469,4.0648,1.0139,2.607,0.0218,4.2944,2.8358,4.7755,1.3823,1.7973,4.0346,2.2225,4.7551,2.1541,4.1822,0.9178,2.7185,0.3227,1.78,2.8495,2.6825,5.8701,0.8588,3.2943,4.0493,2.5889,0.6885]}
{"id":995,"ended":true,"length":575,"gen_text":"You are a relatively silent and shy high school student who is asked to do an on the spot speech on graduation day in front of the crowd. You use this chance to tell your side of high school that you \u2019 ve kept to yourself all four years.\u2021 You were in school for almost five years and you only learned about your class today because of the school.\u202c But you should never worry about the school. It's really time to wake up your child into a life with those lessons.\"\n\nHe said that parents should remind their child when the teacher or assistant tells them they have been caught up in this special class. \"I would add that you're not likely to be taken into a classroom where you will be forced into this particular class of thinking and acting,\" Mr. LeVine said. \"You might see your classmate tell you what they want you to know about the class. You might see that your fellow students are laughing and you probably won't show any reaction, because they have grown up in this special school, and they probably never saw your teacher speak to you and not in a classroom.\"\n\nParents who have seen high school kids are being urged to keep in good touch, as they should. \"Please be on the lookout for this situation on Twitter. Please share this on Twitter so that others know your situation is very serious,\" says Michael A. Sexton, the vice president of the Education Policy Network (EPSN), a Washington think tank.\n\nMany parents say that there are other ways to provide for their children's educations. \"I always say parents should have time to look into that,\" says Kathleen M. Mowbray, an elementary school teacher in New York City and co-author of Learning to Get Back in the Girl, \"but also the rest of us who don't have access to time for high school.\" She notes that teachers often can leave the classroom very early, especially in case of a serious incident like the death of an aide or student who has been accused of sex trafficking.\n\nWhile the EPIN suggests that parents who have been through school-related problems or personal problems should be aware, many students have begun taking precautions to stay away from the school, because of the risks. \"There's absolutely something creepy about having your child turn away and see that you are doing something bad,\" said Mrs. Mowbray.\n\nMr. Hickey has had one such encounter. Mr. Hickey and his wife, a psychologist, were walking to their home when they noticed a group of five people in their parking lot. \"Our daughter took pictures, and then they told some of them that people had taken photographs of her daughter and they were out of her hands,\" said Mr. Hickey. Mr. Hickey said he later called the police and saw the car they were talking on. He went to the nearest hospital for treatment and there was no word from Mr. Hickey's office, which declined to speculate on why the parents were arrested.","token_len":614,"entropy":[3.8827,2.7333,7.9198,8.9997,3.2688,5.1779,7.3008,0.2219,0.7985,1.6649,2.0939,7.1205,0.3678,3.0355,3.9935,4.9249,4.0017,1.399,5.3953,2.6582,7.8695,0.2973,3.869,3.9432,0.0066,2.0169,5.0471,0.8401,2.5338,5.8261,2.9771,5.6183,0.0648,3.6785,1.0958,5.4723,0.0791,10.6036,0.0168,3.2992,0.4623,16.5147,8.8628,13.69,6.3407,3.9715,1.2536,4.5682,7.1103,0.6511,2.0328,3.8732,1.7751,2.3077,4.1473,4.3875,3.6341,1.7448,4.4101,3.0439,0.3015,1.5238,1.787,5.1188,3.4162,1.6839,2.0985,3.85,5.6642,2.0538,1.8193,1.8089,3.7342,2.773,2.7889,4.4799,3.9593,1.4803,5.5623,2.8065,5.1053,0.4182,2.6052,2.1691,1.501,2.7531,1.3192,4.8428,5.8115,0.66,5.488,0.0264,4.6396,4.2665,6.3296,1.4772,3.1284,3.9365,5.6437,5.1285,4.9262,0.5388,0.0011,4.6569,2.5351,1.5831,5.6195,1.4323,5.834,0.5333,4.0341,5.4767,3.0831,3.6416,3.6899,4.7417,3.6956,0.3067,2.0286,2.4416,3.0639,5.2011,2.1536,0.077,3.9957,5.7682,2.9876,0.7011,2.0683,2.563,2.9259,5.7776,0.5114,3.2676,4.3015,1.5304,5.3603,0.0223,1.6426,4.968,2.7092,1.972,2.1909,1.7982,1.0186,3.3686,0.9596,4.3838,3.2749,3.1384,4.608,1.3654,3.4401,4.6862,2.2698,3.4088,2.2973,3.6968,0.2757,5.9585,4.7942,1.6541,0.2543,0.0744,0.833,1.6799,2.9276,4.5502,2.257,4.9336,5.7532,0.3523,3.7415,2.0806,3.0154,1.9479,0.0052,2.3912,2.6128,2.3261,1.0847,1.4253,1.7882,0.8938,1.8372,2.599,1.9964,4.9988,0.82,0.9397,5.5024,1.5709,2.5667,5.4837,2.407,0.0009,6.3395,2.0401,3.0113,3.2645,2.1921,2.4344,3.276,5.8039,0.369,2.1985,1.7194,1.9542,2.3982,3.1474,1.0093,1.3214,4.2353,4.047,2.8243,2.6253,2.7131,4.7263,1.3245,0.6894,4.2378,2.922,4.4508,2.0682,2.4568,2.7382,0.1619,0.0002,4.063,2.5238,2.3337,3.9669,5.6607,0.0508,3.1419,4.5453,3.9866,2.8485,0.1526,3.5006,3.3925,7.2881,2.7693,3.4654,2.943,1.3265,2.8843,1.8698,1.4113,5.1537,2.9277,4.0139,0.3775,0.2788,0.0653,2.9845,4.4822,4.0567,3.6855,2.9808,3.3532,2.8046,1.3886,2.4485,3.17,2.9707,1.0598,1.9036,2.2224,3.8252,1.9045,3.0327,4.4802,1.0004,0.8763,5.2013,4.7663,4.7795,0.4347,6.0772,2.7508,0.1463,2.5484,3.9355,0.0541,0.4192,2.2692,4.4288,1.9119,3.9008,3.8146,1.8662,2.1032,0.3776,0.9803,0.6943,2.6368,3.0036,0.0179,0.4328,1.0073,0.0002,4.8373,0.8444,3.4227,1.1748,4.9598,1.4566,3.1851,1.3662,0.557,5.4437,2.5926,0.2111,0.5245,1.6678,4.3812,0.0277,0.8656,1.5054,2.2297,4.6369,2.1022,4.1486,0.8726,3.3047,4.674,0.3148,3.4296,2.3431,5.0101,1.6798,0.6277,5.6417,3.5689,0.1661,5.049,4.5863,2.059,0.0049,0.2118,3.0471,2.6643,0.3908,0.4055,0.6071,3.1466,0.7333,0.3243,2.8239,3.6473,0.0921,1.0249,0.034,6.261,2.142,5.3428,4.3831,1.6109,1.0342,5.9326,5.113,2.6399,1.4463,3.2424,4.6944,4.7886,0.0398,1.2657,2.1613,3.2084,0.0009,1.0738,3.8888,0.0426,4.0382,2.9716,4.5022,0.0184,2.1357,2.8448,4.8444,0.1304,3.7771,2.5884,4.7145,5.4276,2.3406,0.7006,6.2711,0.4222,1.677,3.9423,2.169,4.5896,0.5136,1.874,4.4952,3.2138,2.3949,2.2836,3.2533,0.0827,2.2881,4.3136,1.2275,2.9433,2.1683,1.8471,0.892,5.0385,0.0383,5.4078,3.2793,0.4071,0.6612,0.0002,5.1427,2.4824,11.1863,5.8276,7.1194,0.5712,0.7788,3.3553,2.1111,2.252,5.5115,4.0771,3.5839,0.5912,3.1299,3.8864,5.0393,1.634,1.225,2.4638,2.2622,3.7141,3.2818,4.0504,2.7199,5.8247,3.836,5.0993,0.9455,3.5415,3.244,0.0288,1.2989,1.2208,2.5895,4.3787,1.5908,0.8371,3.982,1.4718,1.1484,3.5261,1.5352,5.4321,4.8929,6.402,0.3383,2.4509,2.3175,0.9824,5.3545,3.292,3.3702,4.0814,2.7613,1.9415,2.0653,3.9402,0.8459,3.0983,0.923,2.5526,5.4423,0.0011,1.1067,0.0297,0.003,0.001,0.4075,1.6664,0.0002,4.1748,0.0009,4.9324,4.2859,3.6708,4.3336,4.4154,3.1074,2.3661,1.2003,4.7118,0.0006,0.4945,0.001,4.1206,0.3858,1.3213,1.1578,3.8942,5.1755,0.3913,2.0086,3.8316,2.3199,1.5002,2.6267,2.1301,0.9458,2.2245,0.929,3.2542,0.0226,4.6438,4.212,2.1044,1.7862,4.0149,0.0547,1.0555,1.9648,5.4217,1.9376,5.4335,4.1403,2.9557,0.9731,2.3683,1.9309,4.0813,7.2809,0.6909,1.0163,1.4928,6.5346,2.2244,2.7784,3.6963,0.301,2.0596,5.4674,1.9423,2.5206,0.9523,5.6411,0.706,2.8203,5.609,0.4006,1.6261,0.1847,0.0003,0.0481,0.0003,0.2867,4.0376,0.0009,0.0455,0.0004,1.9772,1.2161,5.0658,3.0908,0.7734,0.4696,1.5219,5.2207,1.4393,5.9442,4.7909,0.2412,4.2143,3.2624,1.3409,2.3752,4.0995,0.3397,0.6103,4.5948,3.3796,2.514,1.1283,1.3587,4.7857,0.8001,0.3768,3.078,2.1203,5.2191,0.0006,0.0267,0.0005,1.5036,2.9877,3.458,2.1137,5.5897,0.1695,7.1027,0.851,2.8035,1.1315,3.0205,1.3009,4.7144,0.2852]}

{"id":2676,"ended":true,"length":588,"gen_text":"A person on the verge of giving up is handed a video of their future success.\n\nHowever, that video is almost certainly not accurate, because the man who shot his own shot of success is far from happy.\n\nThe BBC's Mark Harrison writes in the latest issue of Sports Illustrated, that there is nothing that is wrong with players' minds or emotions before they lose and when they are just getting used to it.\n\n\"When you watch video of yourself and your girlfriend taking pictures and videos of yourself, you have to accept that you will lose or your character will deteriorate if you have a very bad experience for any given week.\n\n\"And this is not what we want for video or video games. We want to see more games with the potential to do with your career, your relationships and whether it's a successful one, really your life, your career, your career-making. It's never an option.\"\n\nWhat should players who have failed so badly during the past three years think? This might be the difference in any professional sport.\n\nThey might not feel sorry for David Moyes who won two World Cups and a World Cup. No, they might not even want him to give up. When he says, he believes he can do it. He may think he is the best. At the same time, the players don't know he is the best because they don't know they can succeed in winning trophies or even that they can.\n\nBut you have to look at the facts to see it is not a fair game. It is very dangerous to think that football, and sports in general, is about winning trophies. When players leave clubs for a long distance away at the end of the season, their futures are tied up in what they have done.\n\nThat may be the best way to save them from being relegated by an American club. It may be what the US is going to do for England, or it may be what the US's going to do for Germany. Whether or not the US's playing their way through the season on an unblemished foundation of being top of the table, it isn't winning trophies. It's about having a positive, positive, positive outlook. That is why we have never had one win in the Premier League for a player living his dream of becoming the world's best footballer \u2013 and to achieve that, we need more players of that calibre.\n\nDavid Moyes's team are strong. He has been coaching this nation since 1997. He has scored five Premier League goals and made four in his career, and so has led a group full of players who have already had the chance to succeed.\n\nAs great players become more and more successful, there inevitably will be teams on the pitch that will not be able to continue for many years. And it is not how the team performs on that list that matters. This will not be about losing players but in the end \u2013 players need to have a quality they can play in their team.","token_len":615,"entropy":[7.6763,5.6774,1.5017,4.2823,0.0136,4.9828,0.534,3.3754,10.2989,0.9025,7.7329,1.8642,3.261,7.36,5.4994,1.202,1.2237,0.0004,5.4661,0.065,4.2252,0.9951,1.5967,5.0487,0.8133,1.2233,5.1874,1.7435,2.2975,1.7194,4.532,1.6958,3.7766,4.8813,2.4997,5.6467,3.1562,2.291,1.6335,4.2967,1.1273,5.2546,0.9655,0.6342,0.0002,2.021,6.5325,1.4502,4.0301,5.9439,4.6643,2.7665,1.7818,3.4542,0.2224,0.0623,4.6736,1.3072,2.2173,1.4884,4.6079,1.1505,3.6452,3.5606,3.3443,3.7952,0.0826,5.834,3.906,4.962,3.6192,3.8845,6.0427,1.3056,5.4539,3.9883,5.2296,0.282,2.6289,5.4938,2.7097,4.2615,0.0159,1.3703,0.1586,0.116,0.0001,1.4641,3.5306,1.0645,4.0,4.3059,0.8259,3.2133,3.0509,1.0068,5.8393,4.7728,3.7365,2.7779,2.9444,0.8516,1.0358,2.6568,1.0509,3.4703,1.0368,4.5679,0.558,1.4421,3.8358,1.5102,3.8464,4.0158,5.8099,0.4906,3.1602,0.0002,3.328,0.2002,4.3838,2.5011,5.1122,2.005,3.552,5.5083,3.4106,3.2816,2.9077,1.8902,0.5706,0.0002,0.0656,3.6506,3.3118,0.6486,2.1513,4.1177,2.3826,1.9537,3.3815,4.749,4.9275,2.04,0.9385,0.8194,1.7257,0.2706,1.5243,2.4778,4.5991,3.3509,3.6564,3.2065,4.6499,0.2536,4.5025,4.6648,3.5176,4.6311,1.6963,0.8714,4.5819,1.0121,6.2104,2.2725,0.9536,2.048,3.8496,1.5406,2.3122,6.4056,5.5111,1.8854,1.8942,1.5252,1.682,1.8765,0.7937,1.5211,3.4559,2.5365,2.3686,3.7542,0.4469,5.1069,4.2691,2.7777,1.9451,0.258,0.0002,5.0048,4.872,2.6101,6.0255,2.2052,3.8627,4.3359,1.4392,5.2676,1.9504,0.8418,2.6732,0.8309,2.2391,1.3192,5.8392,4.7421,1.0827,1.6074,5.2302,3.3216,6.1026,5.0889,1.3536,0.6405,0.6004,0.0002,5.4551,1.2665,2.8617,3.9472,3.4667,0.0332,6.9703,2.2926,0.0001,4.6488,3.8129,3.589,2.831,0.0831,1.6078,2.7749,2.6603,0.0296,2.4196,5.5236,0.9896,0.8731,0.5996,1.209,2.5805,2.4211,2.8769,0.7358,5.0523,0.6776,1.0658,6.8618,1.6846,4.42,3.6683,4.4099,5.5502,1.7497,2.0311,2.0626,1.2366,1.1886,2.8288,3.548,3.5014,0.5765,2.8079,2.6104,0.9298,2.6796,5.8904,1.1519,1.4504,0.0071,0.3818,3.5065,3.128,4.0477,0.0008,2.5652,3.0104,1.2966,1.9928,0.2325,4.079,1.181,1.6894,0.0012,0.9643,3.0266,1.7159,3.388,2.4331,6.0294,4.0986,1.8192,2.9625,5.7567,0.7668,0.5994,2.6225,0.3305,0.0001,2.5241,4.8682,2.5186,0.1265,3.162,0.246,1.2593,4.7418,3.0839,1.3304,3.2173,2.098,1.7601,2.4137,5.0501,2.4235,0.5274,3.0311,0.529,4.247,4.3966,1.2608,2.5737,1.0949,4.5484,4.1359,3.1583,4.3711,1.2962,0.0935,0.1047,1.0507,2.4633,1.242,1.1489,0.9952,4.9488,3.1254,5.5255,3.317,3.3632,2.049,2.7635,5.2431,2.7383,5.9507,1.697,0.2924,0.012,1.1866,0.3323,0.6267,3.4423,5.1944,0.6745,4.7127,0.9697,0.5886,3.0537,1.1051,2.4817,1.665,1.3417,0.5613,0.0001,3.8017,4.2421,1.1239,1.6621,2.867,1.7314,0.3827,5.0785,1.8556,1.6929,2.738,5.137,4.3329,4.4233,4.774,1.4696,0.8869,2.5777,1.0113,0.8563,4.9155,2.2206,3.6944,3.3371,3.4412,0.7321,0.2059,2.9933,4.8831,1.9534,2.2736,2.2501,0.0904,0.1231,0.8587,1.0291,2.0325,5.3199,4.1546,0.0043,0.0084,0.1319,2.9383,0.5204,6.3795,2.0343,0.0031,2.1612,0.9944,3.2931,4.5202,3.6944,2.8907,2.5058,1.1708,3.0594,4.5467,3.8596,5.1322,2.7238,0.0056,4.0146,2.795,3.9961,3.3036,1.2528,0.1771,2.0986,1.4708,2.026,4.6026,0.0005,4.8406,0.6425,0.8533,1.7152,1.4784,4.0599,4.6355,1.2602,4.2481,3.0996,1.578,2.1046,0.559,3.6569,1.4193,3.4959,1.1009,3.0594,2.4261,1.8665,5.9543,1.8092,4.1113,5.1039,1.7033,1.5058,2.5531,0.0077,3.3324,1.8786,1.8224,6.3703,2.4745,1.5671,2.0664,1.6928,1.9204,3.7193,0.075,0.3612,1.4694,5.663,2.3213,4.6516,4.481,0.6043,0.9238,2.437,1.0973,3.7601,1.6434,3.7404,1.3763,1.1918,0.0003,0.6823,0.2456,0.0001,4.6426,0.1684,0.0065,3.7412,3.6133,2.2467,5.2888,1.7906,2.5029,1.5228,2.9974,5.3786,4.7161,6.9041,2.3875,4.0568,0.8885,1.2775,0.8753,5.4046,3.7051,1.902,0.0035,0.0561,1.5086,3.8246,2.5619,2.6176,1.8936,1.7884,2.5778,1.373,5.6902,2.4193,4.9886,2.6802,4.6669,5.6542,0.0017,2.0789,1.6002,0.8112,4.9927,3.7679,3.0031,1.2385,0.163,3.4739,0.6149,1.0773,0.0001,4.9314,5.1634,4.0692,4.4356,0.8273,2.0277,0.0058,1.6423,0.2576,3.585,5.9973,1.2917,0.08,4.9651,5.3586,0.4889,1.8744,1.3879,1.7706,2.9116,1.3275,0.7892,0.0088,4.4356,5.2884,2.6028,0.7429,0.8499,2.8362,2.6927,0.8988,1.9005,6.1698,2.2452,3.5415,4.018,3.1489,3.3728,5.5629,0.5959,1.3988,0.3769,4.9265,3.97,1.9676,0.9707,3.1124,5.6008,3.3749,3.1459,5.603,1.4709,2.2769,5.4145,4.9542,4.4292,0.2824,3.2654,1.1486,5.5435,4.7932,0.6554,2.5407,2.3414,3.5897,2.6442,1.0426]}

He said that Mr. Breslin said that he would have been more than a little suspicious of their disappearance if they had been found as recently as December 1990, when they took the stairs to their house. He said that the reason why the couple was found was because she was wearing glasses.\n\nAs he was walking down the road last Saturday, he said, ''I could see she was wearing something.'' Then, he said he felt a bit like a bird when the girl said ''she had the same glasses.''\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith the news of the disappearance of Thelma and the three other women stuck in jail for at least two years, Mr. Breslin said that the only thing now to be done is to take her home. As she spoke her wife was on her way to Los Angeles to make her first family holiday to Mexico.\n\nMr. Lacy said that they found that there were two children living at the house on Sunday when John went to visit them. He said he had no idea what exactly they had been talking about.\n\nMr. Breslin said that he was \"shocked'' at the sight of the girl he had seen with the family, telling them that she had brought a package containing several bottles of champagne from the house.

{"id":249,"ended":false,"length":563,"gen_text":"Two friends are meeting at a high school reunion. They have not seen each other in 10 years. One of them is a congressman, the other one is a recovering heroin addict. The reader does not know which one is which.\n\nMr. Bourgeois is known to those in the community who know him to be a person of interest in the program. He was never arrested.\n\nAn interesting story. The police said that Mr. Bourgeois had used heroin.\n\nHe was taken to a clinic after his arrest. He received a dose of a controlled substance.\n\nA doctor told his parents that he had been taking heroin and it was not normal that he should eat. On the other hand, one of his neighbors had told him he would be normal for dinner.\n\nHe was charged with one count of drug possession and one count of possession of a prescription painkiller, and was released while awaiting trial. Mr. Bourgeois has remained in custody without trial, but he will appear in court for the trial soon.\n\nHe left school, never returned.\n\nMr. Bourgeois had been involved in some illegal activities for 14 years. His brother found out about it when he left school and began to receive abuse from his friends.\n\nAnother friend found out about his involvement in some sort of drug program. He began to get more help through the local chapter of the anti-war group Mothers Against Drunk Driving.\n\nHis father had already had a relationship with Dr. Bourgeois. He knew he could help those who would hurt the feelings of others. At that time, Mr. Bourgeois would find the support of a friend of his who would work for him at local and federal agencies. It was very difficult for him to talk himself out of using the service. He was also concerned about their welfare laws. I should note that at the time, the doctor was in the process of completing his final visit to Washington.\n\nDr. Bourgeois's job was to support those who needed it\n\nMr. Bourgeois was a strong supporter of the Civil Liberties Act of 1964\n\nThe FBI was given the authority to investigate any matter which could be used as a weapon by the police department of any city. It had obtained a warrant for their arrest.\n\nThey got a wiretap recorded by an informant about the murder of a friend of Mr. Bourgeois, The day after the murders occurred, the family became sick for fear that the case might go on the streets. On 10\/11\/1964, Mr. Bourgeois found himself handcuffed and transported by police. On 10, he went to help some of his friends for free in the clinic. He was so afraid that he gave one of his friends a cup of tea so she could take care of her sister. One of her friends wanted to go back to the same area to receive his medicine, so that there wouldn't be any problems with the clinic. \"It was the beginning, was all he knew he had to go home to his new friends.\"","token_len":616,"entropy":[8.3348,3.4915,7.1109,2.0343,1.7665,6.05,0.2932,5.1508,2.5773,2.4292,2.9187,4.7269,2.0708,0.3121,0.0155,1.6915,5.1991,0.135,0.4484,3.5972,0.9953,0.5151,1.5484,1.9307,9.374,2.0312,2.2367,0.0716,4.5044,1.0036,0.3881,8.9265,3.6137,0.0627,0.3605,2.4159,11.0349,5.1305,0.0944,0.9938,2.1473,2.3514,1.4808,1.7895,0.4575,1.4631,0.0306,5.5299,0.1361,4.6929,5.5949,2.034,5.3243,1.5144,5.2811,2.2755,0.7946,2.2328,1.7667,2.0023,0.279,3.5546,0.1191,1.0583,4.9953,0.5391,2.1809,1.5672,1.1193,5.3529,0.525,0.9042,2.7777,5.109,2.7871,1.6719,1.9425,0.0002,5.7903,3.7207,3.0803,3.0429,2.3652,4.1963,3.5058,1.5264,1.7973,0.0006,0.1817,0.0108,1.6101,5.0337,1.2645,3.5009,2.3249,0.0002,3.136,1.4717,4.3932,0.5465,1.3555,4.6835,5.4869,2.6818,1.2196,0.6966,1.2646,4.5933,1.1514,4.9245,0.1552,3.4918,3.8799,0.0317,1.1351,1.7627,0.0002,3.3874,2.8301,2.3222,3.9745,2.3099,0.5502,0.8564,1.2441,1.5988,2.3486,1.2947,2.5086,4.0892,0.8245,2.5252,4.8109,4.6727,0.6794,2.8082,6.9186,2.155,5.9217,0.9505,2.4949,0.0368,0.1093,4.349,0.5974,0.6159,4.1784,2.6481,2.0951,1.0905,2.6084,3.2724,1.4899,5.9582,3.4788,3.541,0.7751,0.7815,0.0002,2.2302,1.352,4.718,0.211,4.2679,0.209,0.3357,3.9954,0.5298,1.3987,0.993,0.0569,0.0212,1.0611,0.1477,0.9861,6.1396,2.9083,0.4083,2.7225,1.8571,1.6827,1.7857,6.3789,2.1078,0.3044,0.2713,4.3031,0.0005,0.0667,0.0062,2.6801,5.5178,0.7093,1.9831,2.996,5.0002,2.5626,1.9281,1.895,3.146,2.8292,0.8267,0.379,3.227,1.7073,2.1799,4.7673,0.1954,0.4195,0.0002,2.697,6.3332,3.6055,3.5366,5.0182,2.6975,1.4959,0.9552,0.0002,2.2877,0.0006,0.1125,0.0071,3.1402,1.8212,3.8743,0.1668,4.2842,4.3642,1.0241,2.4745,6.1319,0.0634,0.6298,3.3852,3.5934,5.8103,1.2895,0.4393,1.5741,1.7157,0.5257,3.7305,0.6817,2.2331,3.3666,1.4448,5.4479,5.1185,3.3082,1.2151,3.0705,0.3753,0.9107,0.0002,5.2332,1.3997,3.9101,0.1439,0.27,2.4168,2.7494,1.0816,3.6536,4.2572,0.0013,1.9531,3.9633,1.0895,1.4222,4.1256,0.7329,2.5159,4.0371,4.6433,5.2553,1.1659,3.4693,3.6462,0.147,0.3608,5.8277,0.0736,2.6374,0.6371,5.8811,0.3884,1.0656,0.0339,0.3777,0.6558,0.0002,3.5533,2.9823,3.0529,4.7585,4.1598,1.3895,3.3235,0.0441,3.6564,0.0097,1.3989,0.0224,1.1913,1.6328,3.6082,2.9894,2.5738,1.586,4.7207,1.1873,4.7784,5.9825,4.0202,4.9082,0.1089,0.7418,0.4054,5.8712,2.3446,0.5231,0.4319,2.6636,0.0005,0.0289,0.0035,4.3468,5.3419,3.5824,2.9507,0.3323,2.7483,2.8192,3.3264,0.1374,1.2851,2.7727,4.2742,2.2895,0.924,4.2142,6.1027,4.192,1.9735,1.2758,0.4397,4.5892,0.592,4.3964,1.9911,0.7383,0.547,0.2087,4.8409,6.0572,0.678,0.0328,4.4108,2.9718,5.626,0.5508,2.1796,1.7095,3.6398,4.2588,0.6379,5.5862,3.5927,6.5214,0.42,6.6793,6.1473,2.2193,0.3443,4.5246,0.9746,0.0733,1.0818,1.9188,5.6512,1.8483,3.2882,1.7294,2.3049,0.0027,5.0599,1.1026,4.874,5.9277,0.468,4.2253,1.2351,0.8568,0.0002,3.2968,0.0009,0.0777,0.002,3.2683,5.1437,0.5139,0.3382,4.6795,2.9728,0.6255,1.3148,1.4233,7.9708,0.0002,2.5981,0.0005,0.0741,0.0041,1.5936,2.1141,4.9694,1.6082,0.0557,0.8043,5.2551,3.2965,1.5985,0.8218,1.1189,4.3994,0.0002,2.4459,5.5979,2.6762,5.4666,1.656,2.8142,0.0663,1.7663,3.2732,3.6326,3.6343,2.9153,1.2989,2.0849,1.3986,0.8499,1.8865,2.8024,0.7934,2.1191,4.6772,3.4608,2.4168,2.5014,1.938,2.6939,3.3976,5.4683,1.7724,0.8678,1.157,3.6262,0.3288,1.3014,0.8244,0.0002,3.3069,5.0773,1.3212,5.54,0.017,6.4466,1.6665,2.8696,1.2184,4.8772,1.568,5.9336,0.1522,1.576,3.8438,0.8932,1.1185,0.0006,0.0468,0.0036,2.8083,6.2555,6.0016,1.118,0.7728,2.6453,4.1064,1.3885,1.5106,6.1402,5.978,5.7994,5.2378,3.2461,1.2056,1.5046,4.2453,1.0181,3.1034,3.6635,3.8878,3.1978,0.7329,5.2277,6.3658,2.2656,2.3558,0.2803,1.724,0.2168,2.3662,0.0035,0.0762,0.0064,5.0246,1.6098,5.8373,1.0147,5.3119,3.0931,1.6203,2.2488,4.6565,2.8286,9.5772,1.0618,3.4254,0.495,6.7896,4.6841,1.6156,0.6824,0.3786,5.8048,4.14,4.2019,1.3836,4.8735,0.4409,1.4566,1.3036,5.49,3.4842,0.8496,0.4323,4.6819,4.6194,0.2032,0.2919,0.3439,0.7912,4.6206,0.0415,1.5179,4.5634,1.9334,0.4728,2.6819,3.8388,0.0086,2.5067,3.5918,0.6301,4.5427,0.6538,1.5704,0.6362,5.5691,0.3033,2.7958,2.9426,0.3853,1.7224,5.0058,4.019,2.3344,5.362,4.0589,1.818,1.9877,1.7081,4.317,5.6134,3.256,0.0007,0.0185,0.6149,1.8733,2.2145,1.3432,3.0831,0.2986,6.2522,2.9822,1.0252,3.1253,4.4918,5.2394,5.9261,3.0134,4.8244,2.2704,5.7387,1.3466,0.9124,2.7431,3.8582,2.0031,2.066,6.588,3.1214,2.4189]}
{"id":1395,"ended":false,"length":575,"gen_text":"You are a criminal mastermind who has taken it upon yourself to play games with the law enforcement trying to catch you. However, you're growing increasingly impatient as your clues are widely misinterpreted and lead the investigators to unexpected people or places.\n\n\"It was only a matter of time before you'd need to find someone who was in charge of all the things that were going on in the world, and that's exactly what he did.\" -FBI agent James O'Keefe.\n\nHe was right \u2014 and he wasn't afraid. He put a man up in front of the house he wanted to watch, and that man was actually watching.\n\nToday's video comes just one day after the two FBI agents who arrested President Donald Trump are charged with one count each of plotting to commit a crime.\n\nThe charges date back to 2016, when one of those two FBI agents was found guilty of trying to sell a fake voter registration form into the Washington D.C., area after a massive warrant found the forms, and the documents were found in the White House, and there's a new batch of information to go on, so you know the key terms.\n\nThey found that the information in the form was \"totally fabricated,\" and those who had the real documents knew what they were signing up for when they got them. They found a whole new set of circumstances.\n\nThe second FBI agent was found guilty in 2016 of attempting to commit felony fraud, and while he wasn't sentenced to the two charges, he had his sentence rescinded due to the FBI finding that he lied about being a law enforcement official as they had investigated his background.\n\nThis means this one dude will only be free once he shows up for work at work if he's paid by federal immigration authorities.\n\nAnd you're still looking for somebody who's actually playing an important and interesting game, so all you'll need to do is check with your FBI agent if you're in any trouble.\n\nIf you're looking for someone with something real, I recommend checking out the other two videos.

{"id":4580,"ended":true,"length":583,"gen_text":"You go out to eat with your strange, new business acquaintance. After the food you each grab a fortune cookie. He opens his up, studies the fortune, looks around with a look of panic and sprints out of the restaurant.\n\n\" Oh that s-shucks.\"\n\nThen the man throws a bag around in the air. He looks at the bag and looks down.\n\n\" Good job,\" he said as he put the bag on the table.\n\nHe was right. In all his years and experience of the company he has no experience on the floor. He still does his work and then it feels okay.\n\nHe tries to have fun. The person always wants to eat with him but doesn't. The person never gives up on him and then tries to go to work with him the next day. If he fails or doesn't come back with a solution he feels sorry for another time. But he goes back to work with him and never fails. He says hello to some other company and never stops working. He does his work and there's a problem and the person tries to have a good relationship with the other employee.\n\nThey all get along nicely. The person always wants to get on with working for some new company and not just one. But sometimes they do not have enough motivation to work on a common issue. Some even feel that some issues like this are something they can handle with only a few minutes.\n\nThe person doesn't want money. The relationship is hard. This is something every business life has to deal with. The people are too busy. The people are too busy to know what is going on, but this one's too much to pass up. And when the time comes it comes back to taking care of the problems.\n\nThe person doesn't want to tell the truth. The time is wasted. The time has been wasted. The person didn't tell the truth that if this is not something that they can handle well.\n\nThey don't have money. Even after work hours the employees are still paying attention. He doesn't care about the employees' finances. He just thinks about them. He makes sure the company pays taxes, the way they get paid.\n\nThe person wants the money. He doesn't even have any money! He just wants something to do with it.\n\nHe knows that no matter how much he has he only wants the things he wants for himself and the company. He has the money. He is happy.

{"id":1718,"ended":true,"length":575,"gen_text":"( credit to \/u\/Arandmoor ) I'm tired of fantasy where Elves are 'better than you'just because they're elves. Give me some sword & sorcery, fantasy-style, where typical elder fantasy races learn why it's not wise to mess with'mere'humans.\n\nI want to do something useful to those people, who need help to deal with their struggles. In short: I'm going to teach those people how to play a game they're not allowed to play, but they have to listen.\n\nI was once called 'Father.' I had a daughter named Elana. She played a game about how she wanted us to die and then we could start again and it was actually fun. As we started play she was saying, 'You can die this time, I'm going to die next time, we've done our thing,' and the fact of the matter is: this time we were already dead.\n\nHere's the big secret to our game: When we talk about how to play, it's about how we deal with our fears and fears about losing. As part of our role in our creation we have to learn to fight, so we have to use our fears\/survivor to help us fight.\n\nThis is a way for us to show some of the magic that we can have in this world when we die. That's okay, because the magic isn't real. When we die, it's so scary, because people start saying: 'You do evil things. How can you make the world this way?' This is something that we can do the same way we can in fairy tales, when that magical fairy is our hero.\n\nWe will teach those people to fight. We will tell them that they're the bad ones, if they give up then they can play a fool and kill you, so their fears and sorrows won't hold at the end.\n\nMy goal is to teach people that I am a wizard. That is, to teach them that playing a game isn't the time to worry about the things I'm afraid of. The only time that I think about it is with kids. I'd like to encourage them to learn how to be human.\n\nI want their own games. We use to have games. We use to have games in our house and we make them play. So we do this as part of our role in the creation of our world.\n\nIt's all about making your own games. We build that ourselves, make the world we want to make. That is what we do together over the course of our lives.\n\nThese are the first steps. I hope to teach them about this in the future.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about this, go back and read about more games to play : How Games Create People\n\nYou can also learn more about fantasy and how to play (especially about what the big deal of RPGs is and how much it takes to create your own game ).","token_len":617,"entropy":[11.0426,4.3374,5.1749,0.4173,0.0011,6.6755,6.4554,7.9667,5.6496,3.0575,7.1887,2.1898,6.8516,0.2672,9.9702,6.094,11.5757,1.606,6.8005,5.7286,1.8353,3.5498,1.0834,11.5083,0.4011,1.0687,1.2344,3.9306,0.9438,7.7216,1.1133,2.4726,9.8155,5.1773,0.9785,2.2836,7.5091,4.497,2.7575,2.2904,4.9844,11.0102,11.3662,6.0352,4.6592,7.7059,7.4255,3.5265,0.377,3.5727,4.9756,0.1751,6.5822,0.2535,14.7872,6.3064,6.1951,9.427,1.4287,2.9469,0.0792,2.7831,4.0892,0.6289,3.9173,1.7278,6.1197,2.2502,4.4072,2.8344,2.1574,3.8458,3.8676,2.6588,3.6591,4.5464,0.0048,1.9559,4.9063,1.0304,4.8385,3.8512,1.8065,2.2573,2.0028,2.1476,0.033,4.0795,4.8342,0.8738,1.4053,0.1572,3.3948,2.7012,1.6316,3.4341,2.6379,1.3922,3.988,0.0525,0.3752,1.6027,3.9581,1.8722,4.1564,0.6946,5.1768,1.3984,1.3254,0.0003,1.984,5.6539,3.9676,4.5515,3.0666,6.1932,5.7152,1.6131,3.8546,1.4363,4.1738,1.9361,5.0274,4.2087,0.9785,1.3136,4.4688,1.9413,2.7575,4.5762,2.7729,2.3782,3.7988,6.2215,0.2724,4.4079,2.1399,2.8418,3.0008,3.3429,4.6407,3.5734,2.7953,3.8484,1.6798,5.3403,1.956,0.5144,5.0949,3.2035,2.9009,5.9349,2.608,2.4034,5.0388,1.0817,1.0551,2.7456,2.4683,3.0679,5.0108,1.905,0.9579,2.8186,1.7027,1.4901,0.0355,2.1526,2.0613,0.2032,1.6587,3.9715,3.3062,3.3418,3.6817,2.3493,4.0989,0.6087,3.9964,5.5314,3.3921,0.0265,0.0084,0.3008,4.8918,3.9431,2.5274,1.553,2.1523,4.973,1.4156,0.7605,1.5598,0.0003,5.8946,0.4285,1.8368,5.2533,3.6059,2.5809,4.6604,2.1972,0.928,4.6568,1.1152,4.3573,0.2772,3.1808,1.8567,0.3777,2.002,2.6446,0.3544,2.7666,1.6723,1.2229,5.0531,0.0094,1.4415,2.8279,1.3538,1.57,2.9918,4.4984,1.3363,4.4947,5.6622,0.0027,1.5111,3.747,2.784,2.2969,5.8028,2.395,2.1685,0.3946,3.1645,1.1097,4.8562,3.0954,4.078,1.1636,1.7783,0.1056,4.6701,0.7666,2.4022,6.5324,5.2297,0.4073,3.7017,3.4427,2.7076,0.8683,1.6506,1.1238,1.0971,0.0002,3.3994,0.8938,2.2888,5.3442,2.1182,1.0529,0.0757,3.9995,4.7622,1.525,1.0062,4.624,1.7474,1.2178,1.9932,2.8532,1.5796,2.7148,0.8297,5.1113,0.2339,4.4086,0.6248,4.2244,0.8812,6.5172,0.9017,1.3998,3.1898,2.4355,3.011,0.0005,3.6901,0.7485,4.6983,0.7312,0.6353,1.1256,2.0979,0.3944,5.2931,5.397,1.9442,3.4503,4.6667,4.8506,4.1637,4.3493,0.4065,2.0634,5.7721,6.2387,1.9978,2.2503,4.7483,1.2747,0.2544,4.2105,3.8009,0.4979,5.5489,2.5421,0.6724,4.1614,0.4501,4.2903,0.9079,1.4444,1.5548,2.1804,6.1652,1.5637,1.2028,1.6651,1.8841,3.1989,5.6186,0.2104,1.8568,3.7207,6.1352,4.8025,3.1153,1.9762,3.6379,2.3214,0.6071,0.5536,0.0002,2.71,4.5867,2.297,2.8404,0.7142,2.6819,2.8348,2.1409,1.4238,0.5393,3.9357,0.1481,1.5999,1.9639,2.7006,3.7287,4.5857,3.267,0.9588,6.2621,0.439,5.0024,1.3783,4.7583,0.8713,2.6347,4.7216,2.4121,5.1087,1.7488,4.7599,3.7838,2.4859,3.0492,5.7086,3.2688,2.0454,8.1142,0.5859,3.2336,0.0017,5.6008,6.5925,2.9093,0.9937,0.9888,1.1905,0.0002,4.9204,1.7782,0.4895,0.3124,1.3775,2.8376,1.6175,5.4295,2.5413,1.7139,4.4857,1.4559,2.3263,3.2946,1.1076,2.3982,1.5221,0.656,0.9906,6.2734,1.0801,0.6967,3.7274,0.0002,2.5635,6.5718,0.4034,3.7917,0.1819,2.5205,3.0004,2.9371,1.5977,1.9117,0.1768,0.8979,3.6816,3.5274,1.3533,2.4569,0.7522,3.4936,1.6076,2.4395,0.2187,4.2358,5.5868,0.877,2.072,4.5563,0.9167,0.241,3.5582,1.1373,0.1232,2.3708,1.7154,0.0535,3.0733,4.376,1.4428,0.8998,0.0002,1.684,1.8013,5.6098,4.4654,3.7192,1.1422,3.4482,6.3839,3.7655,2.72,2.1566,2.8551,1.3127,2.006,0.1075,0.7018,1.2399,3.7611,1.0885,2.9287,2.9507,1.9375,5.1236,1.4446,4.1759,1.5024,4.0572,2.1631,4.3075,2.396,3.7704,1.729,0.0017,0.7651,2.1779,0.6473,1.3311,0.9847,0.2196,1.226,0.3967,0.3849,0.88,0.0002,3.5804,0.3824,3.9517,0.5951,3.4274,3.3657,1.1077,0.9147,0.4776,2.1861,5.151,4.3276,5.0071,1.6737,5.2148,3.0389,2.0382,1.7066,1.2526,1.6439,2.9307,1.5155,3.0844,2.2031,1.9925,1.4246,1.0342,5.7684,7.1746,0.9737,1.5648,0.0021,1.0589,0.7812,0.3457,0.909,0.0002,5.7136,0.9915,1.3987,5.3594,2.7647,2.2034,2.4612,2.1844,3.0451,2.8472,1.7697,2.9556,4.0281,3.7611,1.0359,0.9335,0.4969,1.0899,0.0002,3.3529,0.1594,3.135,1.4303,0.2322,1.3211,0.2552,0.1955,2.3221,1.7668,4.3396,5.1029,1.5305,1.2065,3.2948,5.7764,2.5558,4.8373,1.2883,7.8596,5.2766,5.124,3.5111,3.5326,1.9351,0.0003,3.6731,0.2884,1.0531,4.0769,0.6123,0.0915,5.2036,2.2186,2.8239,0.7789,0.4319,5.2672,4.8688,2.7458,4.1966,3.5108,5.2173,3.3098,2.8688,5.644,1.0589,2.4458,0.8109,4.3135,2.0903,3.8681,0.2186,2.5079,3.8511,0.112,2.1482,4.2944]}
{"id":4839,"ended":false,"length":586,"gen_text":"A new camera was recently developed that filters out sea water, effectively allowing the user to view sea life as if it were swimming through air. You were given the honor of taking the camera to the deepest parts of the ocean for the first time.\n\nHowever, that only came true to those brave swimmers who dared to venture too far in the depths of the sea. While there was still the possibility for ocean life in the depths of a shallow water feature like deep water, those brave swimmers who dared to venture too far in the depths of the ocean just didn't dare, and the situation continued to deteriorate.\n\nThe lack of protection and the lack of awareness of the conditions surrounding it forced some swimmers to set up shop in the shallow water area of the San Leandro Canal where they are most exposed with their diving suits on. There, diving is simply not allowed.\n\nYou still can't catch the big fish like water turtles living in the deep waters\n\nThis can also be considered when your parents don't have the money to get them out of the water at the same time as your parents. Just like the safety issues of the water, it also means that you still can't catch any of the big fish like water turtles living in the deep waters.\n\nSo, you can't do your diving just because you didn't already know where they might live.\n\nThe danger of being stranded (and getting robbed)\n\nThe risk is even higher with underwater diving because there are the risks of missing your mother, too. If you lose your mother at sea you must start diving instead. The dangers are huge, and can be much more severe if you aren't sure where your mother is living. And when you start to lose your mother, you will have to search for other means of shelter, so stay in close contact with family and friends at the beginning of your dives.\n\nEven if your mom died when your dad died, the risks may remain extremely high. On paper, you won't find her in the deep ocean, nor will you be able to locate where she might be hiding with your own hands, so you won't be able to tell him where she is hiding from you, or how she might use her new powers.\n\nIt would be great if you could see where her family might be hiding, even as you're not sure where her family might be hiding. But you won't be able to.\n\nYou can't be sure, if you don't know where your mother might be hiding from you, where she might be hiding from you, and where she might use her new powers.\n\nIf you feel you need to be careful when diving in the long run, check out this article which outlines some of the more common problems you may encounter near the depths of the San Leandro Canal.\n\nDon't worry if you find yourself wondering why you're not diving on your own.\n\nIt might be that some areas of the San Leandro Canal may take longer to open than others","token_len":619,"entropy":[6.4137,8.4193,3.109,4.5198,3.6282,2.7236,7.7883,0.6122,10.029,1.8568,2.2259,6.2801,3.7166,2.0473,4.4479,0.0368,3.2757,4.4544,2.164,3.2509,2.7383,0.2702,0.202,5.751,2.2545,5.9903,0.3155,5.8491,7.7561,3.793,1.5806,10.144,0.1691,3.6383,2.4701,3.4541,2.0824,1.4221,6.7163,3.4807,0.0011,0.2987,0.9237,3.9165,1.607,0.6005,0.0062,0.736,1.0466,0.0007,5.2624,0.0491,4.543,4.7953,3.8983,5.4816,3.3297,4.9275,5.251,6.6431,0.0005,0.6627,3.9395,0.7871,2.6277,4.5811,0.4326,3.0731,0.5626,2.9015,0.6407,0.1636,2.9446,0.3583,4.4364,3.0846,2.3345,2.6962,3.153,1.6093,3.5529,5.9767,1.0477,4.2705,0.7173,2.8065,0.5225,4.5638,4.3465,2.4193,5.0936,2.0958,5.3351,1.2612,0.4878,4.6864,1.5536,0.1075,0.0001,3.1249,1.4935,0.2152,1.0515,0.8742,0.0438,0.9597,0.1194,0.1636,0.061,0.2755,1.0615,5.3576,2.2921,0.0037,3.3498,4.4028,1.7624,2.4373,5.1532,4.3359,0.1208,1.0708,0.0007,0.5753,0.4409,0.0002,2.2887,5.9007,0.0176,4.7296,2.8524,1.9724,1.8444,0.0015,4.1439,0.8297,0.8529,3.9518,3.8066,4.2016,4.895,3.0025,0.9125,0.0002,0.2457,5.6935,1.3219,4.2331,0.9977,1.2872,4.5231,1.7359,3.3591,2.0478,0.4664,5.6408,6.0425,0.0547,4.1375,4.9725,1.0345,4.6452,4.6974,3.182,6.934,1.61,5.2704,3.0754,3.2196,0.3357,4.642,1.4416,6.1509,3.6079,4.621,0.8676,2.1425,0.8566,0.803,0.0002,5.7303,6.1856,2.3645,0.2956,4.8512,1.6576,5.3238,1.7204,1.7655,5.6498,2.6306,6.9268,0.6212,0.6068,1.6743,2.0163,5.3577,0.0002,3.6497,5.2791,2.9467,1.1999,3.5654,3.9843,5.4447,6.1986,3.5301,0.0022,1.2388,1.6776,2.8519,0.4237,4.1869,3.3839,1.8392,0.3899,0.282,1.0971,3.2082,1.3027,0.8503,0.0238,1.5743,2.2608,0.6111,1.4403,6.0012,1.3202,2.1763,5.757,2.7931,2.1328,1.8794,3.2738,1.1768,2.3867,2.7586,2.2919,0.3826,1.6971,3.151,1.4638,0.0023,0.256,4.3509,1.9638,0.14,0.3935,0.0094,0.1039,0.2524,0.0075,0.1703,0.0387,0.0145,0.1188,0.0421,0.6944,0.5151,0.0001,4.3312,1.1964,2.9993,1.9768,1.1577,3.8811,2.9233,1.9279,4.3918,0.828,0.3844,4.187,0.0009,6.2771,1.6694,4.0666,2.9563,5.3384,2.8836,0.638,1.628,0.0001,2.5658,4.8658,0.6788,3.1301,5.1453,6.903,1.9626,3.8264,5.342,0.3073,1.2361,0.0001,2.3974,3.6096,3.2233,2.3139,1.1883,3.0175,4.3964,1.9272,2.6845,2.6497,0.641,5.2103,1.7995,0.5689,5.278,1.9092,4.1427,2.1307,5.6293,0.3084,3.2882,0.3033,4.1803,0.27,0.3153,3.2314,0.4296,3.2401,4.6214,5.254,3.8193,5.566,1.5466,3.1196,3.5448,1.8633,4.2203,1.3934,1.3471,4.8717,1.5004,4.888,1.2657,1.8511,1.5239,0.3142,3.9077,0.0016,4.0685,0.6987,1.197,0.2158,0.7254,5.3968,0.5253,5.3142,3.9448,0.4657,3.4582,2.1756,1.1207,0.4162,0.0873,0.8924,0.8047,1.9347,2.0394,0.5785,4.9826,0.5616,3.3308,3.7555,0.5431,5.6166,2.2328,4.0395,5.5827,2.7835,3.588,1.3628,0.0796,4.3138,1.0277,0.0886,4.6412,2.8699,4.2826,0.2466,0.6836,1.4133,0.3509,0.2671,0.0001,4.0153,0.7581,2.3169,2.5574,4.7189,3.0536,3.4844,2.6919,1.1086,0.4484,3.2099,2.99,4.7263,4.8099,6.1035,0.2818,0.6907,5.6028,6.3346,0.3683,2.2186,3.753,0.0004,2.6344,2.2384,2.2654,0.9948,1.9221,2.5824,1.1209,5.5784,0.397,0.1515,2.5175,0.144,0.0054,3.8711,6.8369,0.722,1.8827,0.6182,3.0923,4.8273,1.1095,2.6056,2.5295,2.5844,1.1848,1.0934,3.6853,0.0003,0.5102,0.1372,0.0056,5.24,6.3606,0.5919,0.6069,0.4813,2.3278,1.7491,0.4696,3.2343,1.7921,2.9491,1.7178,1.1924,5.1223,0.76,4.0793,4.4636,0.7587,0.5782,0.0001,3.4198,3.8765,0.606,3.336,0.204,0.4629,0.6487,4.5419,1.3685,1.2272,2.9716,2.215,0.1571,0.788,1.2968,4.7181,5.6841,0.8659,2.945,3.801,0.3214,0.4065,1.6322,1.4029,0.636,0.0336,0.2668,0.9725,1.7692,2.3993,1.7454,0.0003,0.6064,0.0286,0.0427,1.6306,0.69,0.0001,2.6276,1.8371,0.7804,3.4412,1.3926,4.5045,4.3412,1.2881,3.6404,0.0013,1.1435,0.288,0.8005,0.5813,1.687,0.0485,0.7014,1.2093,0.0928,1.2658,2.8454,0.8792,0.2667,0.2585,0.2152,0.3395,0.2826,0.8105,2.0922,1.7403,0.5395,0.1298,1.7349,0.2444,0.2388,0.065,0.7483,0.5228,0.0001,2.8284,0.2754,4.8767,2.4586,2.2672,0.4885,2.9207,3.3094,3.0739,0.9684,1.974,0.3365,7.0033,1.787,0.1993,5.6956,0.5107,1.8053,1.6866,4.5529,3.1638,1.6497,0.6551,0.0258,3.7813,1.0724,2.54,1.8468,2.2294,1.564,6.3439,0.9606,2.3387,0.0501,0.0851,2.4145,0.0555,0.0001,0.279,0.4672,0.306,0.0001,4.3412,0.0016,3.631,1.5392,0.2915,3.5066,0.421,6.0287,2.4918,0.566,1.6424,1.7551,0.834,4.3763,2.9145,0.135,0.8146,2.5165,0.0001,3.4288,3.7319,0.6524,2.1814,4.6128,4.9172,1.0499,0.1417,1.19,0.0099,0.0001,0.0991,4.3637,6.1936,1.5324,0.9159,1.8817,1.0519,0.1228]}

I hope she has been OK this morning.'\n\nThe girl's mother said her daughter had been found on Hargreaves Road about three yards away from her house near the Hargreaves Gardens home.\n\nA spokesman for Hargreaves Hospital described the couple as a \"good family\".\n\n\"It is with great sadness that this tragic event has occurred,\" they said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, today's tragedy will not be forgotten, there are many things that can be experienced in life, but I cannot remember in this regard anything about this specific event that I saw, or heard (including) in the most recent incident.\"","token_len":619,"entropy":[3.0874,1.802,0.0065,3.0035,2.8254,2.0995,5.6148,1.4027,5.5196,2.3285,3.7505,1.8316,4.3794,1.972,3.9947,3.1326,3.4802,2.4592,4.0253,0.5041,1.5571,5.45,2.0409,0.6342,0.7834,1.9392,4.9219,4.4159,3.9739,0.0698,0.1419,2.9887,0.9999,1.5486,0.0006,1.4462,0.4591,5.5566,0.2106,1.3891,2.4312,0.0004,0.0702,1.4724,2.3806,5.4994,3.3825,1.1542,0.0527,1.8536,3.2403,0.0002,0.0628,1.4025,5.3763,6.8349,4.9388,0.8446,0.4584,4.1776,3.0566,2.169,1.0346,3.4788,1.8934,1.1025,0.8703,0.0002,0.0567,1.3579,3.5014,2.2864,5.2722,4.0476,0.409,4.658,2.0352,1.2894,1.5777,1.7627,4.4794,0.3863,3.8316,1.4646,0.8481,3.0212,1.3299,3.6513,2.6142,3.6059,1.2463,1.4044,3.1248,1.1522,5.6215,3.7095,0.8584,3.7528,0.9159,0.1462,0.0002,2.9205,0.3519,3.3957,1.4026,4.6723,4.6808,2.1394,1.3505,2.2195,2.1757,2.7555,1.6744,2.3549,5.5647,0.5467,1.9154,3.589,1.9231,3.2278,2.7752,2.9883,5.397,5.2721,2.7379,2.1262,4.6038,0.689,2.5401,1.1756,2.6679,0.0741,0.484,0.049,0.0001,5.4795,3.8684,4.2983,0.4119,0.0087,3.6447,5.8295,0.7783,1.3308,0.4713,0.8443,1.7776,6.1557,4.9953,5.4737,3.7524,2.2342,5.1299,1.7183,1.8622,3.8486,2.7028,1.1318,1.7104,2.9107,2.0799,4.7835,1.5762,0.9521,2.1374,4.8084,0.8659,0.3877,5.2237,2.8464,1.7716,0.2158,0.0016,0.0025,5.8036,3.277,1.5059,3.2041,2.0333,3.7459,1.3389,0.0007,4.1399,1.0759,0.1162,0.0002,2.522,0.0881,0.0025,0.0022,2.2252,1.5236,4.8207,2.0957,3.1758,2.9772,1.6248,2.6471,0.7378,3.2996,1.3396,2.8565,1.1778,0.8716,0.0089,0.0008,3.3645,3.4953,0.9751,1.8781,1.8429,3.6041,4.7144,0.3426,2.1453,3.1888,2.98,2.5459,0.3424,0.0784,0.0002,1.0106,2.7957,2.9334,4.5731,0.441,0.7156,3.9012,5.5417,2.5931,4.3326,5.3325,0.3073,1.9727,2.9009,2.0186,2.2796,1.7837,0.2091,3.2187,5.4058,3.336,1.6413,2.0685,2.3113,3.04,2.6199,2.7827,0.2444,6.174,3.2954,2.5225,0.4575,0.2253,0.0422,0.0914,0.0002,0.5098,1.5521,2.7388,0.0004,1.0953,1.6081,2.8263,0.9859,2.8215,0.3396,3.4718,0.9967,3.6134,2.8965,1.3821,1.7758,1.7634,6.5341,3.5145,4.0534,4.0925,1.3101,3.1545,5.0511,2.5538,0.5471,1.6709,4.5834,0.9845,1.273,2.2437,0.0714,0.0002,2.6422,6.9395,1.042,2.9215,3.1778,5.3835,0.3546,0.2445,2.4375,3.9877,3.5628,0.0396,0.0017,0.0012,1.5173,2.7677,2.8506,1.3674,1.8637,1.662,3.3952,2.2705,2.0699,2.1973,0.6846,1.1999,0.4417,0.1863,0.0002,1.1046,4.395,2.2888,3.2699,2.0571,1.1323,5.6858,1.3473,5.9015,5.6752,4.3882,3.231,1.4165,1.26,2.3019,4.6058,3.045,2.4826,4.6353,3.7353,5.9335,5.2915,5.2808,0.867,0.7645,0.395,0.2216,0.0367,0.101,0.0003,0.3485,2.5746,1.728,5.2703,3.9431,1.5198,1.8588,1.4953,1.5732,2.4104,0.0004,1.0353,1.8216,1.0039,1.4271,0.8344,1.642,4.7477,4.5042,1.2472,2.0794,0.7477,3.2783,5.3032,0.4837,0.0002,0.0214,1.0336,3.5813,2.6001,3.6657,2.6076,0.9057,5.4726,4.1523,3.7355,0.804,4.8426,1.0049,1.0508,0.9779,4.9729,0.271,1.8841,2.1253,6.0864,0.7399,0.2618,0.2058,2.8509,1.4852,4.3055,2.4633,3.5092,3.9705,0.6243,5.079,1.1731,1.6834,4.016,3.3044,2.9904,0.2897,0.0002,0.0218,2.1728,5.0115,0.5264,0.2685,3.0474,1.16,3.4257,1.8414,4.6261,3.7059,0.7953,0.5058,0.0607,0.1685,2.1721,0.3701,2.5665,5.552,0.6614,1.3737,5.1526,3.6651,1.3964,4.2524,0.2611,1.8131,5.587,4.7846,2.161,5.0335,2.976,4.5959,0.8826,1.3812,2.3635,0.5794,0.4379,1.1359,1.6814,0.7574,0.2095,0.0002,3.0571,5.5982,0.2936,0.3894,0.3988,3.839,1.5567,0.0044,2.3209,0.553,2.2824,0.4231,2.8259,3.2275,0.6405,2.0214,2.2987,4.9778,4.2556,2.7298,4.2837,5.4366,5.1072,4.3134,3.6753,4.5896,5.8884,3.6312,3.7698,0.9051,2.4053,2.1003,2.2636,1.9103,3.4615,3.2007,3.9484,5.6484,1.2567,1.2429,0.1097,0.0002,2.2837,5.3572,1.2055,2.2342,2.244,2.581,0.4994,1.1253,0.8917,5.5641,3.1757,1.0167,0.223,0.0033,0.0007,0.3098,3.3962,3.578,7.0502,1.1933,1.0029,1.1899,2.2428,5.8043,1.748,3.0064,0.2854,0.0737,0.0037,5.598,3.7698,1.0134,0.0728,0.0002,3.79,3.1211,0.1017,1.8989,0.067,0.002,0.0032,3.5319,5.3884,1.1355,4.6348,0.3663,2.2511,1.2143,2.6007,0.9177,0.9236,0.1152,0.0002,0.8732,2.759,1.0712,0.6428,0.9483,0.2208,0.3543,2.9887,2.4216,1.6384,0.5496,1.0186,0.8244,3.0635,0.2934,0.3246,0.1628,0.0004,0.2672,5.0429,0.681,5.3957,1.6291,3.2803,2.8654,1.0785,0.8719,0.8968,2.4155,5.1407,2.0076,0.9294,2.2179,0.7893,1.754,0.6991,6.4708,1.9374,0.9369,1.7774,1.9757,3.6329,3.1943,4.0361,4.9085,2.2356,6.3839,3.9782,5.3261,1.0548,5.2698,3.6555,1.8917,2.4224,4.7414,3.2471,2.3209,2.2181,7.0725,6.0939,1.067,3.546,1.3014,5.6832,0.6096,2.3274,1.4406]}

{"id":527,"ended":true,"length":572,"gen_text":"The `` dislike '' button on YouTube videos is replaced with a `` electrocute uploader '' button.\n\nIn October, Fox News anchor Bret Baier wrote an op-ed about his YouTube channel titled ``Trump: A Guide to YouTube and How to Get Your Webcams Back,'' titled: `Donald Trump: A Guide to YouTube.\n\nHe was right; the campaign is not afraid to attack any company.\n\nIn a blog titled, `Donald Trump Is a Fascist,' he writes:\n\n'Donald Trump is being attacked by an organization with whom he disagrees who can and must fight their bigotry with open hostility. The only way to stop the onslaught would be to give Trump what he wants -- or more: more money. As a result more and more people are getting caught in the crossfire of this hate-fueled, racist campaign that seeks to divide, silence and destroy us all.'\n\nI can believe that someone would want to help us stop this kind of attack.\n\nAt 9:03 p.m., the New York Times' editorial board stated, ``Bret Baier's call to action is based on the notion that Donald Trump is racist. He is wrong,'' The Times said in its statement.\n\nWhy, then, is this right wing conspiracy now taking on these kinds of attacks?\n\nIn fact, the main reason for the calls is the fear of losing their business if they lose coverage in the media due to that hate campaign. As James Van Pelt reports, CNN, CNNA and others are now making these attacks known as an \"emotionally charged'' campaign against Donald Trump by taking a stand against what they call their ``racist, racist, xenophobic and homoascist, far-right racist cult'' in support of Donald Trump's candidacy.\n\nI'm sure that's a strange move to make. A large American empire is already struggling to survive. The only thing that makes this kind of attack even longer is that it may be seen by any other American people.\n\nIn any event, these efforts to get Fox News to shut down due to the Trump campaign are nothing short of a major scandal. I am concerned that any effort to shut down Fox News will be viewed by people who are sympathetic to the billionaire who is making so much money at CNN, NBC and others, and that's just not likely to happen now. The fact that the campaign of Donald Trump has decided to focus on this, and attack so hard the campaign has been fighting this election season, is disturbing.\n\nAs long as it's not on CNN -- that's a thing that does not merit our coverage -- the election will continue to be a sham, all of these conspiracy theories will remain alive and well, and we will continue to give our free will to people like Trump. A candidate that is not merely a businessman, does not represent the best interests of the American people, a candidate that is not simply in the campaign but is part man and part corporation has no business in this country.","token_len":619,"entropy":[10.8809,18.3906,4.3071,6.7301,2.3705,8.2846,6.9397,1.8011,7.492,0.9879,0.8878,1.9387,12.7987,3.7498,1.279,10.533,3.4974,0.663,0.9721,0.8332,1.5578,0.0023,3.2202,4.8368,1.6845,5.6522,0.4317,4.1166,2.7799,0.0024,0.0,4.8649,1.5534,1.5686,0.0025,0.0005,4.0854,3.3094,4.5581,1.9198,3.0021,1.0671,5.1974,3.1271,2.6462,4.8148,0.3921,3.8547,3.1564,3.5429,0.9922,2.6128,3.3753,4.8145,4.7614,0.0033,3.9122,1.2549,4.5743,3.1498,4.0249,3.6054,0.1275,1.5724,0.9845,0.2198,0.0645,0.4264,3.2563,3.3539,0.0003,3.4737,4.3817,4.2699,4.5685,2.0689,4.871,3.0054,2.8995,5.6157,0.4801,4.2281,4.4217,5.6329,3.3817,1.424,0.0002,2.7161,2.0818,3.656,4.9514,1.7878,3.3763,2.1147,0.0238,4.3215,1.9003,5.4975,0.6521,2.4723,2.3315,2.5676,0.6435,0.9971,0.0002,3.4916,2.767,0.05,0.6312,6.4213,2.4081,1.1397,3.8062,2.9644,3.4245,4.421,0.4857,2.0205,6.4322,4.257,3.2683,3.1589,3.8743,5.0117,3.7614,3.4751,4.9188,3.8569,0.8717,2.5481,3.3118,1.0503,0.5412,1.1238,2.7761,4.908,3.8444,0.0357,0.3332,4.8135,3.7932,4.4654,0.0816,0.7187,3.6611,4.6296,4.4123,5.4747,4.0413,1.7809,1.5031,4.5594,2.1548,1.6427,8.2469,1.1015,0.0048,0.9729,0.6199,3.9443,4.9398,1.9194,0.6236,1.8839,0.1685,1.0013,3.2672,4.121,2.1123,2.7406,0.0111,3.0719,2.7243,2.0458,3.2081,4.4966,0.116,2.9378,2.8847,4.1639,0.6317,0.9687,2.5519,0.8215,1.3231,0.43,0.0004,4.088,3.5457,5.2227,1.2223,4.7087,2.0436,2.6293,0.3166,4.9903,3.6517,3.4702,0.9078,4.1138,0.0027,3.1527,0.9166,1.0223,0.0003,5.5752,6.7022,0.1972,4.4969,1.5012,0.0007,0.0004,0.7863,2.1356,3.7158,0.0463,0.2671,3.2145,3.5885,0.6709,4.8201,1.8208,1.3255,6.0718,0.4727,0.0534,0.0008,1.9145,5.7123,1.3552,1.4611,1.2986,5.0244,0.262,1.8954,4.1065,0.0485,2.0962,0.0124,0.655,5.2382,1.511,2.3964,1.3246,4.4167,5.1168,4.0168,0.9267,2.2429,1.682,1.9883,3.8067,0.2959,0.6383,0.0002,5.4509,3.85,1.3222,0.0265,1.827,2.2905,5.8783,4.2902,4.1201,6.2125,4.02,2.1421,5.1133,4.1907,0.0005,1.2653,0.5182,0.768,0.0002,3.4387,2.5353,0.0353,1.8724,5.5399,0.9746,2.6435,1.0644,5.524,1.7359,2.3712,4.0033,1.0007,3.7794,2.6836,4.2569,3.6299,1.1448,3.656,5.9231,2.5918,0.7573,1.156,6.1351,0.0027,5.8345,2.7118,2.5631,0.2574,4.9809,5.5453,5.7006,3.8437,0.0271,4.6236,0.9921,3.2602,2.4524,12.9141,5.2752,0.8759,1.6794,1.5209,2.4812,4.6667,4.4844,2.2554,3.9472,3.162,3.3589,3.3634,5.5374,2.8391,1.1498,1.725,2.9745,1.3722,2.609,1.4728,0.0295,4.7353,5.1469,2.4416,1.7028,0.5121,4.0693,0.3715,2.3667,4.7359,4.168,2.8941,1.951,3.2938,0.9428,2.2797,0.0298,1.0936,6.2511,3.2098,6.0531,3.9746,5.4399,0.3782,0.1564,4.8648,5.2598,2.389,2.9372,4.9404,0.0035,2.1978,0.0372,2.6524,0.856,0.2674,0.2187,0.0002,4.147,2.6983,1.6898,1.7057,3.5918,2.3874,5.7949,5.0449,2.0702,1.1042,1.3769,5.3127,5.0353,5.9813,6.0713,1.6405,3.9407,4.4885,0.6701,1.8129,1.9893,2.6732,3.5068,2.1611,1.1619,3.1075,2.1369,2.3239,0.0005,2.0758,2.1964,7.661,0.8406,0.9544,1.6206,5.0597,1.6123,4.6613,2.0649,5.8312,3.5948,1.9145,4.2348,2.8555,0.5834,0.0003,3.2984,3.9736,1.5231,0.0268,4.2539,4.9235,1.852,3.5849,4.7276,0.4046,1.0878,4.1214,0.0754,4.5868,0.0045,1.6245,3.4264,0.606,1.5831,3.2305,1.5264,0.0006,1.4636,4.0689,5.3398,0.4341,4.1009,3.5932,5.3752,0.7007,4.1837,3.478,0.4276,2.8541,0.2282,1.3963,0.3137,1.8065,1.7678,3.0892,1.6316,3.8546,0.8476,1.7149,4.426,0.1423,1.0546,5.8926,3.3388,1.3806,3.8663,4.6792,0.7196,0.1778,3.985,4.3311,1.5155,3.8971,0.9558,1.7073,2.6299,1.1717,3.1823,4.2261,2.6003,2.4184,5.635,0.6232,1.1028,5.4036,0.416,4.4128,3.3085,0.5024,2.1725,3.4235,2.771,0.9664,0.0257,1.982,4.4759,0.2251,4.3523,0.5708,2.8239,4.6535,1.3094,5.7159,5.2472,3.7252,4.1545,3.2705,2.1916,2.7335,4.6449,4.1362,3.5294,2.4341,0.8277,0.9599,3.6804,0.6487,0.3938,0.0003,3.6084,4.4436,0.0065,3.1684,1.4906,1.7903,4.8975,1.5824,5.2334,3.4094,0.6378,2.0586,5.5872,1.6185,5.7043,0.4308,5.5453,4.6167,3.372,0.735,2.6522,5.1447,1.0359,0.6247,0.7777,0.7882,1.6483,4.0541,2.4423,5.8782,2.2162,4.1977,4.6013,0.1645,1.7862,4.1081,3.562,1.1879,0.1511,1.3742,0.3754,2.58,0.7456,0.816,0.0683,5.7175,2.4928,4.7822,4.2527,0.5662,3.5165,1.4671,2.5031,0.9963,6.6245,5.2849,2.756,1.542,2.3252,5.4293,1.4598,4.6688,0.9527,7.0913,0.0215,2.3565,1.1613,4.1372,0.2779,0.0081,0.9396,0.6591,0.0513,1.1065,5.339,0.4988,0.4679,1.0582,0.9948,1.7756,5.6703,1.3846,5.7058,2.9578,1.4777,3.5938,8.7727,1.4173,0.0504,4.2834,3.5804,1.6781,2.043,2.0593,1.4635,0.3127,0.4117]}
{"id":3643,"ended":true,"length":596,"gen_text":"For your entire life, you've had a voice in your head counting down, and it's getting close to zero.\n\nHowever, that voice is coming to you in the form of a simple, self-policing program that you can read aloud and\/or follow through. It's really time to wake up your child into recognizing that there is a place within you for you to feel all alone and safe. The more people see this program, the more they will have a hope for a better relationship with you, and the more likely this will have been one that you knew you could trust with your entire life.\n\nAs a matter of fact, it has become a reality, with your relationship with your baby growing, you have more love and understanding. As a result, your baby's future has arrived with you. You won't have to start talking to your baby about any issues or fears that may arise. Instead, they won't have to go through a stressful date with you. Just have a good relationship with each other through the relationship and make meaningful progress!\n\nIt also helps to have a relationship with your baby on a daily basis, so you can enjoy each other's company ( you can be a good influence, too ), even if you feel like it isn't for your child right now. Your child will know that you understand what 'you want'. If she doesn't, she is going to need to know the answers. It makes perfect sense to put her at the center line, and she can begin to look at the answers like a real-life woman, because you're the very heart that she needs to understand and share with the rest of her world.\n\nYour baby will know that you love her at the beginning, and when she does not, she will grow up with a clear understanding of what'she wants.' And that you will be there for her on her way to a happy relationship!\n\nDon't just listen to this program.\n\nDon't just walk around and ask yourself : \"\"When will I trust myself enough to tell my son what I want?\" \"If I have a problem I can tell it to My Boy.\"\n\nWhat I am trying to do here, you 'voting' for my son, is just to get him one of these things written in for sure. I think it's worth the effort. It's kind of important now to let him go over this first line of the entire program. Let him understand that you 'll never stop thinking about him because you want him to be the best he can be if he knows what that line is about and how it can help you reach our goals. That makes me happy that it's all here for him anyway!\n\nThere is also a lot of other things that you can do to continue this simple message of love, and that helps you to connect with your child. I think that's about 10 ways you can help your baby understand how you love the world by helping him to grow in a way that he doesn't expect.","token_len":620,"entropy":[5.8592,6.8663,1.9296,0.5126,1.0082,2.3929,2.9728,2.0798,6.6701,1.9831,2.0811,1.8768,11.3876,0.7767,5.3072,1.9534,2.83,0.6331,5.1738,7.0497,0.8862,4.0171,0.591,1.5179,0.0036,5.8361,0.0862,3.5759,0.6957,1.2705,3.7329,2.8484,0.6779,2.785,1.7429,0.4453,0.0144,1.3375,5.2875,2.4907,5.0712,0.0936,5.0086,0.9616,0.003,5.5059,1.9178,1.863,1.1924,4.3766,4.7963,2.6463,5.7237,0.0004,5.0207,1.9429,3.0018,2.1515,0.6101,5.574,5.9744,0.8719,4.5817,0.0268,5.1508,4.3361,4.8367,5.7067,1.2235,2.6541,1.1235,1.1436,3.5095,4.5508,0.7159,0.9857,1.6918,1.1393,3.7601,4.8828,3.1427,1.0978,4.0284,0.7936,4.066,3.5418,3.8821,5.203,2.5187,1.2654,0.4462,0.0247,0.4291,1.2622,1.7342,4.6003,1.1073,6.1498,1.1201,2.3749,1.329,4.4843,0.8032,0.6835,1.757,0.5676,1.0411,0.4613,3.0179,4.3307,1.2254,5.2024,4.4261,4.203,1.7968,1.1817,4.7375,1.0903,1.5788,2.6454,3.5385,0.8402,3.9587,0.058,0.2019,0.3809,0.0002,4.2092,1.9078,5.4931,0.0011,0.088,0.0554,2.6275,2.9013,2.9401,1.8057,3.5329,3.0721,3.2369,4.6457,5.0819,0.8132,0.9276,3.9476,2.2402,2.683,3.3972,2.6606,3.3634,5.4488,1.1227,2.9897,2.8718,3.7631,1.2827,1.429,0.1181,2.1049,2.1163,2.2128,5.1286,3.036,5.0385,4.3749,1.7441,1.0336,2.417,5.2183,0.0077,1.3782,0.1701,5.4308,5.2341,1.3724,1.4915,1.4419,0.8853,4.2079,2.939,2.1052,5.0032,2.2569,2.2329,1.6479,1.7193,2.7095,0.0612,3.8498,4.4614,0.0004,0.7205,0.0501,3.9671,0.4156,2.6212,4.1398,6.2998,1.815,0.6054,1.4395,5.3459,5.354,1.1202,2.026,4.7611,0.6745,4.2357,0.0379,5.2441,1.6127,4.7932,2.8886,3.718,6.7052,2.6597,5.349,0.2984,0.0001,3.6252,4.2575,1.6402,0.7774,1.5566,0.7452,4.1339,1.1052,0.438,1.1759,4.3637,0.88,1.4635,0.021,1.5634,2.0646,1.6497,0.9416,5.1043,3.5835,0.0856,0.246,0.1373,5.5217,10.3392,1.6437,3.3143,2.14,2.6765,6.0397,2.6732,2.4318,5.4676,3.9107,0.5052,1.0466,3.9898,1.0544,1.9728,3.4204,0.0008,3.2151,3.055,1.454,4.8462,0.0448,0.1716,3.9554,1.866,1.4394,3.3647,1.0907,1.0944,4.5716,2.3576,8.8836,2.9443,3.2874,3.6476,3.4138,3.0189,1.4924,0.0007,1.0525,1.4831,3.8642,1.5301,0.0169,3.9508,0.9026,3.1354,4.2441,3.5859,1.5044,3.2803,3.6766,3.892,0.0044,1.411,5.0462,2.0749,3.5806,1.7725,0.8876,7.9998,2.4242,1.5497,2.6618,2.2857,4.7571,0.3799,5.4273,1.4929,1.9331,4.3183,5.5982,1.3316,3.5508,4.7328,0.0948,5.5426,2.2657,3.9503,2.6694,2.4865,2.9351,6.4664,3.6475,3.1465,1.5174,1.154,0.3318,2.8479,2.5427,5.0507,1.5276,3.2948,3.0125,0.0025,1.1345,2.2042,0.1823,0.3388,0.0001,4.3153,1.0183,1.4489,2.874,0.5466,0.7863,2.2052,0.4414,5.6912,1.3755,3.8381,1.2203,0.5859,3.579,0.5566,2.6619,4.3895,0.2818,0.7453,0.8063,4.6027,1.0131,2.2366,2.3734,4.542,1.735,0.3009,1.1524,2.8558,19.0658,3.1973,9.1511,5.0278,2.0898,3.1932,1.8019,1.8393,2.8071,0.5658,0.0833,4.4848,2.1277,3.0592,0.9629,3.0667,1.3628,3.5007,3.6458,0.3907,0.0002,4.8958,0.0134,3.682,3.187,0.0983,3.0315,1.8088,1.2554,2.7932,0.0002,2.93,0.0009,0.8564,5.2436,2.4971,2.0405,3.6794,2.5479,7.4758,6.6123,5.2769,1.5568,1.1382,6.0454,4.1172,3.4021,0.2647,4.1932,0.6827,3.6393,2.1194,1.198,0.4705,1.9245,4.3516,3.4119,0.7739,2.7675,1.6957,1.9795,3.2567,1.272,3.9433,2.821,0.2667,7.9635,4.5921,3.5624,1.8832,0.0002,4.4079,3.3812,2.8823,2.0422,0.0162,2.1838,1.7995,3.5445,5.6102,8.4414,7.1951,3.5588,0.7696,1.3454,3.9809,2.2514,1.4136,0.4772,5.0734,1.2541,4.0071,0.8461,6.5773,1.2021,1.3888,2.8211,6.097,1.7026,5.5035,4.4876,0.8848,2.9511,3.6611,1.4204,0.8346,4.7386,2.5938,0.8552,0.9805,2.9507,1.0781,5.4877,0.0033,4.6856,6.2728,1.851,4.0592,1.2724,5.0031,6.0299,2.7986,5.094,3.8224,1.3611,1.6761,6.0875,0.9422,1.2437,4.4541,0.5946,3.5437,0.6252,1.8241,4.7775,5.8883,3.3421,3.4602,3.7424,0.1819,0.8383,3.5791,1.5293,2.9821,0.6641,0.1575,1.4587,3.3828,1.2939,1.6337,0.0716,0.0784,5.7248,0.5283,4.0363,1.0605,4.8609,5.5094,0.937,1.4284,2.5803,2.8412,1.7347,3.2928,1.2954,2.0766,3.9982,6.0802,1.3692,0.5284,4.3861,5.8141,2.9089,2.0211,3.1451,3.8698,0.9263,3.8447,2.8334,2.4074,0.3372,5.9945,1.9391,0.4325,0.0002,4.4951,1.2482,3.3133,0.7284,3.2303,0.5358,3.0015,1.6203,1.4406,1.2967,0.2767,0.2044,0.9396,6.1754,2.2829,4.8835,3.4207,2.3412,2.4381,2.1476,1.5801,2.6225,4.7845,1.4866,1.987,4.2592,0.3098,0.5508,0.9962,1.461,2.7827,2.8116,2.1221,1.9577,4.8497,6.4575,5.2329,1.99,0.0508,1.9462,0.8036,1.2062,4.2709,3.0395,2.0776,2.5585,5.3179,0.793,5.1249,4.0035,0.647,1.7624,3.1578,2.837,1.5369,1.0399,0.1433,1.8265,2.717,0.0005,5.1293,0.5917]}
{"id":524,"ended":true,"length":603,"gen_text":"Emotions have started manifesting themselves into living breathing lifeforms. Yours are in your kitchen right now. your father is in your car. your mom is in your house. your sister is in your house. and all of it makes you cry.\n\nPeople are saying that in their time, your life will be complete. My daughter has been living in this world for 10 years now after coming and living through my life. How will it feel to have this experience where I don't have to give up but feel so helpless that I won't have the energy to leave now? How will I feel right now if I have to leave or get sent home because I've done wrong with my relationship with my mother? If you have this experience, how can you expect to live your life while you have to stay home?\n\nAs anyone who has been around can tell you, your parents, your siblings, your teachers will always speak to you and say that whatever you have done to get through life, things will ultimately come to you. That's good enough, but not when you are in this position to feel that your situation is a complete, complete disaster and that you are in a state of hopelessness. I'm talking about the way these circumstances present themselves to your children, which will impact on how you will feel about what your parents do. This is why we need to take care of our children. That's what we are doing here. My life will be complete because I have never had as much time to grow up that way. What will it like for me after my parents die? And when you go to prison you will have all of these issues?\n\nEvery person you meet and meet makes mistakes. I feel that I must learn from people, because all their mistakes are mine. My parents gave me this opportunity to do my part. No one else in my life did so. They gave me the courage to go through what I did.\n\nWhen my family separated and my kids were born, I experienced their life events for the first time. We have witnessed a variety of tragedies in our lives. Today I am proud to recognize that my situation did turn out okay. This isn't what I expected, even as you, my wife and I, can expect from a young adult. Instead, I came to realize that my actions can be just as terrible as my actions today. We owe it to ourselves and our children to take responsibility for our own actions.\n\nMy situation does not end with some tragic accident that killed this kid. It's not the best situation. We owe it to ourselves that we are able to be responsible for how things went our way. That makes me happy that it's over, for our child to become fully healthy again.\n\nNow that your children have fully recovered enough for this event to be considered a successful event, we are going to go take a little break to thank you today and remember you for helping so many people. You are one of the main reasons why I'm giving my children this special responsibility.","token_len":620,"entropy":[10.0722,4.4841,5.5607,9.5887,0.0238,1.3832,4.4385,8.1098,7.9495,4.7445,4.9485,1.1172,5.7394,7.2604,3.9464,4.6682,2.661,7.0755,5.5282,0.0128,1.0906,7.7656,5.4567,1.1826,2.0112,0.9919,3.4019,0.5805,0.7294,1.7133,0.3509,1.0523,0.3,2.3129,0.1622,0.8573,1.8125,0.219,0.6605,0.2153,2.2064,0.1595,3.1744,3.7556,0.8481,3.0817,3.7976,1.0067,4.3894,0.6229,2.1588,0.0538,5.7165,2.0702,4.1377,1.6854,4.9507,3.4291,5.8009,1.2824,3.2004,2.3795,2.0674,0.8991,5.5904,0.8341,5.2527,4.5003,2.7352,2.1652,2.7731,1.7699,2.024,1.7169,0.4226,3.4023,0.2405,0.8779,6.7163,5.4659,6.8015,3.0852,3.4583,3.3929,3.7681,1.3576,5.4437,3.6097,2.3834,2.2219,0.6733,2.1636,2.9224,2.4982,5.0806,1.4371,4.0694,0.0007,1.2368,0.5791,4.5579,0.4282,5.0773,4.0884,2.7503,4.4674,2.7848,0.3033,5.1398,0.0003,3.4116,1.3532,2.6831,0.3279,4.5029,3.4508,0.4618,2.1607,0.3631,1.4806,1.256,4.683,0.0465,1.7788,0.6035,2.4385,0.5847,1.542,4.493,4.239,5.8403,1.6731,3.1879,0.9498,3.3766,4.0082,5.3106,4.9426,0.2506,5.5262,0.6463,0.2022,2.7527,0.451,4.6275,2.9122,2.261,3.7534,1.7034,0.6502,2.4817,2.1715,0.4607,4.8892,1.1224,1.8717,1.6794,0.2017,5.4697,2.1552,2.5742,1.1636,4.8553,3.2664,1.4055,0.5814,0.0002,4.329,6.5166,0.3212,0.4157,1.7203,3.4951,4.0845,0.4103,0.0351,0.0876,3.0987,3.5412,3.8311,1.3731,1.6813,0.2859,0.4969,3.1237,5.1253,2.0643,5.8784,2.2866,0.0599,2.2695,2.2851,1.5765,5.5296,0.9467,2.2594,0.8714,2.8411,3.4001,2.498,1.5932,1.2493,5.3654,1.2708,6.6925,2.3814,1.0676,2.0081,0.6817,3.8417,1.2832,5.5356,3.3518,2.8405,1.2351,3.7167,4.3731,0.7601,2.2368,2.5461,2.2564,3.4478,2.5293,3.6735,2.3095,2.6292,3.9336,0.5503,3.469,2.5409,3.9041,1.4459,2.0876,2.6353,1.2571,0.7456,2.0128,2.9663,1.7499,2.2502,0.1043,3.2068,0.2473,0.6253,3.6688,2.5749,3.4493,0.1682,2.0973,4.0026,5.3731,5.0906,5.0836,0.3541,0.9988,3.6905,2.359,1.7399,4.4486,3.6099,4.8791,3.0305,2.0553,0.8737,1.8733,2.3581,1.2215,3.4935,2.9942,2.0883,3.5856,1.9667,4.2953,0.7743,3.4712,3.3277,1.5946,0.3022,3.3154,2.693,0.2738,1.3433,0.557,1.7601,4.7481,0.577,1.8347,1.1372,2.4775,1.2099,1.7267,0.8314,5.6269,4.469,1.8424,0.7583,0.9334,4.3309,0.9081,1.7564,4.5269,1.7443,7.0005,0.2713,1.7408,1.0828,5.0703,0.5552,5.0837,2.7087,0.5976,5.0044,2.6434,2.7453,6.4698,2.9196,0.9682,4.6723,2.8081,2.2987,2.3976,0.4153,4.5578,3.5225,3.018,3.3295,1.2305,4.5345,4.0272,0.833,1.6668,4.2492,1.3179,2.1571,3.4235,4.9685,0.9805,0.0001,5.5969,3.4361,4.9234,0.9305,4.1845,1.7412,4.8739,1.8311,0.8956,2.6903,4.6523,2.0502,2.2699,4.9682,3.3949,1.123,4.836,2.8708,3.2,4.9995,6.2844,0.4822,1.077,2.5016,0.4489,2.8266,2.4117,4.6311,0.1306,3.0901,1.6349,1.0521,3.4416,3.0712,2.9302,1.6364,5.8367,0.7118,2.4394,2.6275,0.4574,0.2603,2.817,2.8003,1.2785,2.4301,2.147,0.1378,1.3947,4.2824,0.2203,2.8601,1.2631,2.4503,0.7965,1.0614,1.0234,2.8018,0.0001,3.2536,2.5374,3.3294,5.6969,2.6192,1.3734,5.8663,1.4715,1.5692,0.2684,0.9849,5.6256,4.9748,4.3101,4.5283,4.6354,0.0387,0.0316,0.001,0.4214,3.8851,3.8483,5.8665,3.127,4.8204,0.0025,5.025,2.6662,0.4935,0.3717,0.588,6.061,1.7303,1.7287,3.5814,0.3911,6.4095,1.529,1.5711,4.858,4.071,7.8328,0.1565,4.0554,1.0404,4.2817,4.2075,0.0004,3.7924,1.3637,1.526,2.1734,5.3124,4.4604,5.0936,5.059,1.3886,2.7598,1.0613,0.611,0.933,5.3897,2.1247,1.9178,1.8722,4.506,2.0515,0.8486,5.3137,0.5598,1.1219,5.1887,0.6785,1.3901,0.2821,1.6797,3.9588,4.7886,2.1122,4.7251,0.1258,4.4512,0.9713,1.5405,1.072,4.7753,0.1373,3.9086,5.8297,0.8892,0.048,1.1494,1.7167,0.8804,0.3904,0.2186,2.8146,1.9496,0.1945,0.8525,1.7101,1.0986,0.7145,0.9617,0.0001,2.925,4.4669,4.0571,0.2915,3.6245,1.2808,6.5111,4.3923,2.4846,2.7768,5.6666,5.9671,4.5617,0.4985,1.1545,2.6684,1.4349,3.0434,5.2829,3.194,2.2444,3.1331,3.2511,0.3202,0.0534,0.3894,4.8107,0.2847,2.8664,1.735,0.0053,3.7836,1.5601,0.5278,4.4887,3.032,2.242,6.6945,0.1661,0.4441,3.6211,5.0915,1.7751,2.8587,2.2513,3.7675,2.0893,3.7252,2.4179,5.3151,2.8776,4.5125,2.4192,5.0987,4.1166,2.2764,1.4989,0.5239,1.5478,0.0001,4.5574,1.4647,3.952,2.9927,1.3339,4.7437,1.6576,7.0742,3.3511,3.5718,3.7201,0.4985,1.8947,3.6275,1.0077,5.2253,1.1454,0.2281,2.4426,2.1769,1.6521,0.0281,3.2865,6.2034,1.4844,4.0103,2.0508,2.9753,5.2415,0.4703,8.1526,3.0035,4.3944,1.388,1.5866,3.624,4.2238,0.5135,1.2451,1.1209,3.0695,1.659,3.1851,0.185,0.5092,6.4963,0.3611,1.211,1.264,2.6346,4.2713,2.8304,3.2983,2.2399,3.4715,6.1384,0.4839]}
{"id":2868,"ended":false,"length":591,"gen_text":"There were Heroes when I was a boy... I couldn't do the math to find him, so I didn't need his help.\n\n\"I would spend hours wondering how to make a new car to get him to play a soccer game.\"\n\nHe took those lessons with him and was able to win them after just six weeks of playing.\n\nHe played on the National Team for seven years, beginning when he was 12 but never getting the gold medal, the silver and the bronze medals. When he was 18 he scored a hat trick with a teammate on a penalty kick in a 2-2 draw with Australia.\n\nWatson coached one of those last two Worlds teams to the 2010 World Cup in Toronto, his hometown, in which he won the title and scored four times but also had three penalty kicks and two triples.\n\nHe won that year's team championship but also the bronze medal in Montreal, where he said the crowd cheered his decision. This year, Watson said in a television interview that when he was 18, he asked his parents, who live in B.C., why he was there. He said they told him the answer to one of Canada's many reasons, which was he wanted to change the way he walked.\n\n\"They told me, 'You don't have to worry about it. Everybody cares about you and you should change your way of living,'\" Watson said.\n\nHe hasn't made that change. He has done what many will deny, and he is doing it without shame.\n\n\"I just went and bought the car,\" He said. \"I was in New York and I was like, 'Wow, I'm going to put a roof over my head when I get out of the car. You're going to see how different you felt that day.'\"\n\nHe will not be allowed to drive out of the garage for three weeks. If he does, it will be for an exhibition game or at an exhibition event. If he cannot, it will be until the next World Cup qualifier, the opening of the new World Cup, at which time he will be permitted to drive.\n\nIf he does, He said he will just try again. That is the plan. \"I will be there all day long, doing everything we need to do to be there,\" He said.\n\nHe will not be taking any drugs.\n\n\"I think I would love to see people get to meet me, meet my best teammate.... I would try to play with good teammates and be there with my teammate every single day.\"\n\nHe'll still be a young man.

A battle between the crew of the Mars Express and a Martian army that destroyed the Earth and destroyed Jove, in a battle where the main character, Earth, was sent flying, has been revealed in later episodes.","token_len":621,"entropy":[5.6538,2.2699,1.4116,9.9969,7.3989,4.1527,9.91,5.278,0.2855,1.9142,0.3988,6.7235,2.271,7.5766,8.9855,1.1779,6.8376,0.0171,12.3029,0.1433,6.4138,1.2817,2.2305,0.0031,3.2511,4.2904,5.7325,3.0181,0.4989,1.916,4.8975,1.988,5.006,1.465,1.8413,5.8626,0.3592,5.1904,1.0129,2.1146,0.0005,1.0055,2.7687,0.0002,1.1416,1.9802,1.3789,1.7754,2.061,0.0257,5.3863,2.583,0.488,3.7109,1.3466,1.3051,2.9211,1.9465,1.893,0.6963,3.6033,5.5037,3.924,5.8086,0.2834,5.7733,2.1833,0.5322,0.777,0.0002,0.7969,2.2853,1.5572,0.3986,6.0421,3.8937,0.7326,4.6371,3.3731,0.3845,4.1015,3.6158,1.0481,3.303,4.5171,4.6434,1.6477,2.7667,0.4556,4.6294,0.035,4.4113,6.1217,3.9404,1.8318,0.0444,1.428,5.095,1.1566,3.3233,1.7371,5.1261,0.9145,5.4452,0.3315,1.8036,3.3952,1.135,0.0121,3.0043,0.9328,5.0822,0.0043,4.7916,0.8231,5.8863,1.2718,2.6158,0.5716,0.0185,1.4349,3.5759,2.1406,5.1208,1.0097,2.9176,5.6817,4.61,5.7384,5.0132,1.872,1.1821,3.9939,2.8787,0.1844,1.3683,2.9998,0.834,5.794,1.7606,4.9426,4.0191,2.0976,2.4263,1.5463,5.4251,0.0198,0.27,0.791,0.0002,10.7724,3.8601,0.3572,0.0018,0.1573,0.0031,0.0184,0.0045,0.0381,0.0032,0.0273,0.0015,0.0233,0.0025,0.005,0.0017,0.0034,0.0033,0.0184,0.0017,0.0099,0.0054,0.0128,0.0033,0.0043,0.0002,0.0094,0.0073,0.0007,0.001,0.0056,0.0015,0.0009,0.0015,0.0154,0.001,0.0234,0.0019,0.0006,0.0036,0.0005,0.0021,5.2697,4.4196,0.9351,1.2153,2.3924,5.3902,5.7085,1.2591,2.4236,0.0002,7.1368,0.5159,0.1332,0.0057,0.6241,0.0384,0.245,0.0039,0.026,0.0109,0.0311,0.0014,0.0448,0.003,0.0074,0.0028,0.0031,0.0047,0.0208,0.0021,0.0131,0.0037,0.0084,0.0038,0.0041,0.0006,0.0076,0.0038,0.0006,0.0012,0.0036,0.002,0.0008,0.0016,4.237,0.0011,0.0204,0.0031,0.001,0.0021,0.0006,0.0043,0.2093,0.4831,0.0002,0.0038,0.0052,2.2644,0.0013,7.0753,5.5144,0.6511,0.552,1.7015,5.0717,1.9291,0.9947,4.2961,4.3403,0.7699,2.864,1.095,1.1199,0.52,1.2093,0.0002,2.3357,5.7948,2.9827,3.3045,3.1466,5.7721,3.191,0.3199,3.5044,0.9515,1.225,0.2925,0.4658,1.0519,1.2895,5.6009,1.2465,1.6546,0.0879,4.8475,1.419,4.009,5.648,5.5619,4.5667,1.3121,4.5376,2.9914,4.9853,4.3745,5.0628,4.2589,4.3782,6.7735,2.5072,1.2804,3.1443,2.3086,1.5279,5.9366,7.2956,2.6906,1.4932,2.9623,2.4508,0.3895,1.1751,5.9969,1.9457,0.7684,4.2319,4.7421,2.8407,1.3108,2.0523,2.0419,0.1255,2.4436,0.5064,0.8182,0.0003,1.1974,3.1083,0.6895,0.0149,0.0007,0.0068,0.0002,0.0017,0.0126,0.0197,0.0418,0.0051,0.0036,0.0067,0.0399,0.0149,0.0341,0.002,0.0039,0.0042,0.0028,0.0024,0.0248,0.0011,0.0011,0.0076,0.0264,0.0061,0.0024,0.0016,0.01,0.0046,0.0076,0.0011,0.0163,0.0055,0.0054,0.0084,0.0019,0.0067,0.0006,1.6606,1.21,1.7939,2.2201,0.9865,0.3844,2.3376,4.4318,3.8238,5.128,2.1659,4.4507,4.3856,4.4337,1.0343,4.1084,5.6228,1.1362,5.4737,4.6694,6.4896,2.3486,4.4231,5.4102,4.4054,2.344,2.8806,1.8737,2.9946,1.0094,3.2984,2.648,3.4001,2.9867,4.8184,0.2049,4.0013,6.2331,3.9656,0.0031,4.2939,0.0929,4.3322,3.0657,4.6653,2.7824,0.3854,0.6242,0.0002,2.0492,0.6736,1.0977,1.7665,0.3473,0.8342,4.5938,4.295,0.7628,1.3037,2.8571,5.6479,2.2371,1.4272,0.0002,0.9782,0.4193,1.1081,0.135,0.1195,1.4737,2.7614,2.9161,0.3883,3.0946,4.6372,2.0056,4.1024,1.3784,3.5475,0.1168,2.477,0.9751,4.3072,6.1995,3.4421,2.8199,4.3569,1.9307,1.4837,5.0547,2.2268,2.5774,5.7157,1.1239,5.599,1.6812,4.2989,0.6183,2.0752,3.3644,5.6162,4.8416,5.6478,2.1955,2.3901,1.1852,2.5157,2.1057,2.0043,0.1369,2.3986,4.1484,2.5845,0.0558,2.7008,1.0851,2.1409,2.5691,5.4083,3.5821,0.7738,0.391,0.0002,1.0794,0.4805,1.6913,0.9618,0.2131,1.4546,5.996,1.5854,1.8663,4.7311,0.107,3.2499,1.1135,0.6652,0.0002,0.3707,0.1972,0.6532,0.0554,0.0735,6.0916,3.2506,1.6418,5.5435,0.193,5.4419,2.2831,5.2898,0.1665,3.0872,4.6771,5.8922,3.5004,5.478,5.2313,0.2761,5.1083,1.8239,4.4245,1.704,3.6342,6.302,3.0902,0.7056,0.5821,4.432,3.7343,1.0018,4.6849,0.2677,5.1166,1.1192,0.3378,5.9113,0.0717,5.1782,1.2835,1.1553,0.405,4.864,5.3616,3.367,0.2773,1.213,4.5893,2.9842,1.3763,0.9938,5.7515,0.207,4.6275,3.0869,4.8062,5.4463,1.91,0.7771,5.2436,1.7298,0.6111,2.1268,0.8212,5.8987,4.8859,0.9521,5.1644,5.5309,1.1167,1.67,4.3979,0.3252,0.4744,3.5199,1.9491,0.4076,2.42,2.2958,4.2625,3.5154,3.5784,1.1063,2.5947,2.7857,2.5939,4.222,0.0128,2.339,3.9468,3.2535,2.1728,3.3535,1.2643,5.6658,1.4252,2.4101,4.6096,0.6717,1.9994,4.1802,4.9929,1.9973,2.9856,1.3504,3.4311,2.4223,4.6777,0.4232,0.7214]}
{"id":457,"ended":false,"length":587,"gen_text":"Humanity has begun exploring the galaxy, we find many worlds filled with ruins of civilizations that had long died out, realizing soon that all of these civilizations chose to end themselves, committing mass suicide. No one could figure out why they did it, until now.\n\nHowever, that did not stop the inhabitants of the galaxy, who knew how to defeat those empires with all their might. After destroying everything in their way, they realized how difficult it was to defeat everything, but once they conquered those planets, mankind began anew.\n\nThey then began to create the new planet, using the same tactics that had been used during the Cold War that they had used, such as the new technology that the Empire had unleashed. On the other hand, the empires of the Imperium had also been using advanced technology for years, since the creation of Earth-Earth Union :\n\nIn any one long time we will know what was the reason for using advanced technology, since our own civilization was created with the help of them, but it would really stand alone as one empire that never died.\n\nI, however, find it very hard to convince my people, because so many of the other world leaders were too good to live alone with their own children. Their children were too weak and useless, and they were not enough to hold the Alliance together.\n\nThe very fact that we already knew the reasons why one world ruled all, however, also made me feel great. Especially now that we know the reasons why we already know we will make the best of our defeat.\",\n\nEven though there were many other forces in this world, it could never be denied that they were fighting for a better future, but this world's will only become stronger through the use of the very world that fought for them.\n\nOf the many forces that had been fighting so hard for this planet, but with an army and a people that had been conquered, we would always win, but what could we do to turn our enemies against us?\n\nThe Imperial Space Marine Legions\n\nThe Alliance was not a small or unified force, instead it was one big federation with lots of factions, that were vying for power for the past half century.\n\nEvery member of the Alliance had their own factions, so if something happened between them, they had the power to make sure things got better.\n\nWhen you came together with friends and family you found new alliances.\n\nWith all of the different nations who were living together in this galaxy, the world's will to win was very different to many of the other empires of this galaxy.\n\nWe had to create an organization to protect the planet, to unite this galaxy

create the organization that would hold us together in battle and create an alliance with the entire Earth-Earth Alliance.\n\nA few days later the Empire announced new objectives

Johnson and others at the National Museum of Natural History - include three skeletons that have already been found that have been found to have two heads, with one being missing the head and the other facing left. The head has since been completely recovered with a head missing.\n\nAccording to Dr Johnson, the skeleton remains were found in 2010 inside a small box the group dug out from the bottom of the deep mud bed after a massive landslide in the mountains, near the village of Takamaki. It was there that the work began and the remains are still on top.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nThey found the bodies of three separate skeletons in 2010 on a shallow dug-out in a remote stretch of forest near the village of Takamaki (pictured earlier)\n\nDr Johnson, a senior curator at the National Museum of Natural History, said: 'It has now been revealed that the two skeletons had been found with similar heads without any head missing - no more than four feet apart'.\n\nThe museum said in a media release following that discovery that they had 'found three skeletons with similar heads without any head missing.\n\n'Our research shows that the four-foot head - with its missing head - lies in the right location on our topography - in this case in Takamaki.'\n\nThere has been no official confirmation which head remains have been found. The pair do not believe any were found.\n\nThe bones were found on Tuesday in the ground beneath a field at the bottom of the village where the skeleton was found with its head missing.\n\nOne of the dead men could be seen laying on the ground at the site of the body.\n\nThe researcher said the two skeletons had both been found with similar heads with no head missing.\n\nHis team, which includes scientists at the Museum of Ichthyology and Environmental Medicine, began the research by first taking a deep sand-bed on the Yamamoto River to the village of Takamaki, using the first of several layers of mud to build a sand-track as it dug deeper to a high level of the mountain.\n\n'We then used sand bags and mud slides that we would use to dig up more mud to form our sand.' Dr Johnson said.\n\nThey removed four more human bodies within a few days from the dirt-dwelling site, and the first was found in November\n\nAfter digging deeper, they extracted a skeleton with the head, with an upper skull - and found fragments of a human head beneath the body.\n\nThe two skulls have now been tested against the DNA for safety.","token_len":621,"entropy":[8.0313,1.2421,5.1289,2.6899,2.1683,0.1375,0.9446,8.8221,1.755,4.0245,6.5051,0.0055,0.1824,5.9042,2.8654,1.4302,8.3482,0.0047,1.8068,2.3533,6.1952,0.6231,1.0738,0.0004,2.9852,2.6455,4.9905,2.659,2.6958,1.0071,4.7456,4.2084,0.1569,0.7934,5.7989,5.2825,0.299,2.0171,1.6134,4.0729,1.1446,1.7081,0.4472,1.1137,5.3644,2.4481,0.5387,4.1664,3.2706,0.1284,0.7907,4.0145,0.1255,0.6173,0.3583,0.0002,3.4961,1.8966,0.807,5.5417,2.6312,1.9001,2.2762,2.5934,3.1556,2.9392,3.4629,5.1067,0.7128,7.0778,4.8951,2.8074,0.422,1.1493,0.1821,0.0003,2.8849,0.0115,0.0105,0.0257,0.0654,0.0002,1.7627,4.8638,4.4958,3.7362,1.2355,3.8668,4.2084,5.4198,2.1567,5.226,2.8451,3.646,1.1906,0.6938,2.8978,0.3302,0.0842,0.5446,0.012,1.5406,3.6756,4.0423,4.8431,1.8918,2.2808,4.0821,0.1055,1.9518,5.1965,2.2215,1.7316,3.5663,2.7561,1.6086,5.178,3.7712,1.6382,4.4685,2.057,2.4242,2.7374,3.4159,2.3525,1.9931,0.6012,0.0781,6.6676,3.3513,0.7516,1.5165,2.7735,2.6962,5.9293,0.1023,5.2325,3.9159,5.1596,1.9226,3.3621,4.1156,1.2969,1.4202,0.0003,4.9445,0.002,2.0784,0.4521,0.4083,0.768,3.1565,5.1665,2.2241,1.3082,1.2223,5.7659,6.0164,0.5634,4.3334,3.434,5.8845,4.7112,4.5415,2.0057,1.6904,1.386,3.2437,0.0527,1.6586,5.6882,3.3516,4.3833,4.8661,2.1869,4.822,1.6425,1.818,1.3788,3.9162,4.3902,3.7074,1.4263,2.1301,0.0193,4.4997,2.9327,2.9803,0.925,4.1131,0.959,4.5002,0.3943,1.1851,5.7058,1.159,3.1474,1.849,3.3204,2.5749,2.2513,3.6256,3.4701,1.8462,0.1676,0.0002,2.6584,0.0033,0.0062,0.0031,0.0969,0.0002,3.8604,2.2832,0.7837,4.4794,0.2386,1.5804,5.2154,2.4506,2.1335,1.6995,3.3927,1.4675,3.8538,4.772,2.018,0.019,1.5881,2.128,2.0409,6.6726,0.0097,2.9687,1.3367,0.7884,0.5292,0.0376,0.0459,0.0029,0.0008,3.0385,0.4502,6.0369,1.6906,0.8645,0.0002,2.3149,0.2166,2.0351,1.6055,3.9062,3.6174,0.7648,0.1335,0.6072,0.0308,0.1157,0.0134,0.0013,0.5649,0.6827,1.0739,0.0127,2.1581,3.5625,3.2481,0.2158,3.1351,0.2121,1.096,2.4445,2.0699,3.6518,1.4678,1.512,3.7267,5.8266,1.7808,6.2923,2.0289,1.1029,1.922,4.0074,5.5053,3.9796,1.2348,3.6344,2.074,1.847,5.0163,0.1152,0.0003,1.5994,5.3588,2.5809,2.6044,0.179,7.213,0.3454,6.1839,6.9651,0.3844,0.4941,2.8293,1.094,2.7735,2.6352,3.5401,2.5882,1.9767,2.5952,0.22,0.4138,0.1609,0.0254,0.0139,3.0178,0.5818,0.0002,0.0585,4.627,2.5238,2.303,0.3593,1.1224,4.3947,1.8326,0.5774,1.9125,5.1956,3.4673,2.4579,3.0303,0.7228,1.0647,5.7297,1.9711,1.0261,4.1405,3.0618,2.25,5.2043,4.5094,2.5256,4.2827,2.6541,3.0516,0.8196,1.9862,2.6062,0.0135,0.0024,1.8437,0.0476,0.0002,5.3848,2.6228,0.5336,1.2844,1.9424,0.3503,6.1858,3.5021,3.5846,2.0931,0.2792,0.2837,1.6818,2.8018,5.0152,6.0137,0.2739,1.3371,3.9605,3.5225,1.0686,2.0353,0.2945,0.0003,1.5136,4.2557,1.5261,0.6088,2.3255,4.7201,1.7438,1.2415,5.1425,2.1082,1.0685,4.1898,3.7308,1.0578,4.0291,0.0111,0.9623,4.5481,3.3624,1.0223,4.7917,0.6291,0.4647,5.9677,2.2896,0.7771,1.3898,0.5343,0.3217,0.0003,4.6031,0.5016,0.1045,5.0036,4.2031,5.2808,0.9443,1.1623,5.7153,0.8675,0.534,0.3922,3.9523,0.314,2.5424,2.3688,0.1341,4.1085,1.3004,0.5611,0.0003,1.3616,5.5133,1.3183,1.5283,2.9066,1.3474,1.0069,4.3793,0.497,0.3804,0.8839,0.8563,0.0703,3.9139,1.1257,0.0759,0.0123,0.9249,0.3603,0.0003,4.9151,0.8301,3.0518,1.7093,1.7649,3.0859,2.292,0.4691,3.3266,0.0685,5.036,0.159,0.0543,1.2402,5.1778,3.551,0.8053,5.4228,2.5798,2.686,3.3754,5.1813,4.1841,1.5205,3.9944,6.19,3.6709,2.1593,4.3532,0.5898,5.1528,3.5527,1.6922,3.1959,2.2398,3.6105,0.4814,0.7496,0.0263,0.0015,1.6384,6.2525,2.8532,5.4618,2.5365,3.057,4.9406,0.0693,1.4463,2.043,3.4392,0.941,4.4109,2.2169,5.7321,5.4271,2.0217,3.9616,2.6088,3.0562,4.6885,6.7569,2.9615,2.9496,0.762,4.3022,0.4208,0.1105,0.0003,3.3693,1.4136,2.3354,2.6352,2.8731,6.4564,2.0653,3.9242,4.9781,5.1477,1.8952,5.0902,1.6007,0.544,1.9281,2.1179,4.9072,1.1248,1.8979,3.3548,4.1671,1.7115,5.931,3.4428,0.1468,0.4259,0.1652,0.1647,0.0003,2.8489,5.3109,4.1946,4.6194,5.3387,3.654,6.4421,1.4391,1.9989,1.2559,2.9892,0.2639,5.9423,3.0499,4.067,0.9463,0.0379,1.8055,1.6252,1.97,3.4287,3.6041,2.8395,0.798,1.6604,4.0483,6.1955,0.0003,3.8649,2.2499,3.022,1.0812,1.0737,5.5937,2.2029,3.9441,2.4224,1.8646,0.717,3.7072,3.5691,4.0456,4.0471,3.8932,4.7811,3.052,2.7866,6.5558,0.1725,1.4772,2.3503,0.9068,6.1227,1.5223,2.0826,0.9991,0.4707,0.0003,1.3101,3.4306,2.775,2.9228,2.1291,0.0788,5.1389,4.8265,1.7468,4.2353,4.5782,5.7075,1.6801]}
{"id":2368,"ended":true,"length":585,"gen_text":"The Drone by Alex Nice, 7 September 2017\n\nThis is really just the first one. We're now ready for another post with all the things I have learned and tested to see what I can learn from doing it. I hope you like using it!\n\nAbout Us\n\nOur business is all about finding and delivering the highest quality drone using the highest quality parts and materials. All of our products are manufactured with premium parts and quality manufacturing. All our services have been tested and proven so that customers will trust us and the service we offer.\n\nHow is It Used?\n\nThe drone is used to carry loads through an outdoor or outdoor field. This helps with a large payload and can be a lifesaver in a long shot or when the ground is dry. A drone that keeps your drone away from the ground can give your drone its privacy, and can provide a very efficient flight experience\n\nWhat Can This Drone Do?\n\nUse it in a wind tunnel or wind tunnel control mode\n\nTo get your drone moving and on a higher charge like this you can use it in a remote control mode or in a remote control mode where the drone is kept near the ground. The drone will then switch to the higher charge and then will begin its flight. At the lower charge the drone will stay at the higher rate.\n\nWhat's the Problem?\n\nIn order to provide optimal quality performance as well as ease of use it can be done with this type of drone. By making sure that you use the lowest rate possible you get the best performance possible. The low end of this range is a bit too high for my liking because I know my drone is not going to have very long range or slow motion when I fly. It is important to understand that even for a low end drone the speed at which the drone switches will not be what you consider optimal.\n\nI am also aware that when you are going low you won't be able to tell how long the drone will last at, what you can expect from it and so on. I would highly recommend that you check with your drone's owner. The owner will know as you fly the drone and if you can put his or her finger on it they will give you a real quick and clear answer.\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nI am now really excited to see more about this wonderful design. Here are two photos from it showing the features that it gives:\n\nThe propeller itself that creates the best flight.\n\nThe tiny antennas that give good visibility and so provide more power to the drone for each landing.\n\nYou can find all of all of these awesome features here (except for the camera)\n\nThere is a lot more to this drone (if you haven't seen) and it seems to be the best, most fun, and cheap drone yet! It really makes our job really easy for you \u2013 we need to share it with you all (the community of engineers and designers of drones) and please consider giving it a try.\n\nSee you next time.","token_len":623,"entropy":[12.5821,6.9514,6.1641,11.5072,2.7877,5.8061,3.345,2.2494,0.4314,0.0031,3.7083,1.2379,4.7505,3.9476,2.8237,2.2924,3.6103,1.8113,3.1355,2.1741,4.2937,4.1463,1.2874,3.5654,4.9574,3.0499,4.4912,0.535,5.4848,2.8131,2.9237,2.1518,3.4263,4.9734,4.444,2.6743,1.39,2.3446,0.4799,2.5437,0.7204,4.7847,1.7603,0.3731,2.4224,2.0077,0.6363,2.5541,7.4924,1.428,1.9971,0.672,0.0002,5.3664,4.2554,0.4713,0.0001,3.7929,4.2758,0.4829,5.0841,0.1052,4.4737,2.3966,3.7929,1.6058,3.0435,0.0619,3.6395,5.42,1.322,2.0526,0.1843,2.2096,1.6227,0.9398,0.4087,4.2905,1.2143,0.2687,1.6223,0.3701,2.6065,2.7812,4.9438,2.8124,1.0632,3.3571,3.6736,2.0654,3.2293,2.255,4.5809,3.6879,0.5218,2.3988,1.0379,2.9583,5.2919,1.7425,6.0513,1.744,3.8636,0.7716,1.9551,3.9633,3.7157,0.9895,1.764,0.3772,1.0768,0.0001,4.1818,4.3505,3.6296,1.4481,0.191,0.0241,0.0001,1.9102,1.4142,0.7368,2.0985,1.7304,3.911,5.0551,4.7899,3.5513,4.1296,4.3236,3.6708,4.4463,1.1357,2.9075,4.7417,3.3803,4.5959,4.2594,3.2076,2.0755,2.5129,1.2416,2.9298,3.8273,0.0111,2.1207,1.9165,3.7475,5.5925,2.8178,3.391,2.933,4.3,0.3716,3.2095,0.2848,4.2599,2.3735,2.7026,6.1168,3.3315,2.2862,4.8084,0.0443,1.5585,1.4393,1.9069,4.8076,2.7969,1.104,4.2912,5.4447,2.4653,3.1154,2.497,3.6509,1.5758,4.25,4.1901,4.9566,3.601,5.783,0.0002,2.2621,3.6309,5.2509,0.3416,0.1783,0.1157,0.021,0.0001,5.3027,1.2672,2.8883,1.3068,5.9769,0.9741,1.2256,3.1822,0.3249,5.0023,3.8068,3.0182,0.0001,5.2327,3.063,2.8481,0.1836,4.2547,2.6064,5.2412,2.2824,5.1789,5.1118,5.6924,3.7322,2.2353,1.4778,1.1671,0.9611,1.5924,0.7287,5.2504,0.5493,0.7186,2.6346,2.1771,0.6904,4.2456,0.5191,0.8942,2.8498,1.714,0.7286,1.1527,4.7173,5.5724,0.6946,0.5293,1.3132,2.7205,0.7563,1.7053,3.7077,5.3896,0.9101,2.1036,3.9374,0.4265,2.0924,3.0664,4.2465,4.7926,2.7248,0.7699,0.8948,5.8569,1.721,5.4512,0.2064,1.1924,0.0702,0.3494,3.64,2.7187,0.6585,2.0879,2.8823,1.5361,1.0082,0.0002,2.5545,3.288,1.8275,5.4824,0.3206,0.0421,0.0001,4.234,2.0628,0.1184,4.7966,4.3005,5.2322,3.9034,5.6523,1.0627,0.0101,4.9078,0.1313,0.3045,3.1259,2.934,0.3326,5.26,1.6702,5.8665,2.8984,0.003,1.12,0.3843,6.0069,4.2683,1.7243,1.1487,2.4815,2.9554,0.8394,2.2266,4.6693,1.7558,1.6623,4.1437,1.0862,0.4426,0.9692,2.5412,0.6892,2.5085,3.5011,5.5521,1.4591,1.1689,2.1915,0.7556,3.3191,3.8187,3.6302,1.0639,1.351,3.6803,2.3703,3.2361,1.6087,4.8375,3.7683,0.7973,1.5881,1.9441,1.824,0.1179,4.4136,4.8042,3.1427,1.7846,3.2687,4.7514,3.2275,3.7143,2.0331,2.3032,1.5072,3.363,1.5657,3.6475,0.4557,3.2412,0.3041,3.7702,4.043,1.4706,1.5247,1.5459,0.4858,2.2681,3.4757,2.3877,0.0076,1.0942,0.3333,4.3712,2.7203,1.9405,0.8107,5.074,1.1073,6.5718,1.5708,0.5781,1.1844,0.0001,3.2586,2.576,2.8733,2.6558,0.2444,4.0016,1.9225,1.9788,4.6048,3.0467,1.9448,4.8998,0.0012,1.1169,0.2323,0.0074,4.4256,3.2006,2.224,1.1249,0.4116,0.8596,2.1228,4.2355,6.1436,3.7161,2.6595,2.5374,1.6415,1.6518,1.1264,1.5527,3.3861,0.3233,0.2365,2.3298,2.6604,4.0969,0.3477,1.5014,0.1803,2.8663,2.6768,0.3011,1.7006,2.1848,3.0268,3.1407,3.195,1.715,1.1904,2.3782,4.7782,3.6636,2.2046,1.3783,0.0925,3.0442,3.6528,1.3522,2.921,5.8654,5.001,0.9732,0.0032,1.2756,0.1537,1.6919,2.5506,0.3986,4.0784,0.1989,1.1448,5.0327,4.6167,2.6421,3.3769,1.6717,0.524,0.6062,0.0001,2.116,1.9806,2.9234,0.1953,0.0637,0.0001,1.5382,1.783,3.6429,4.8279,1.8148,0.9244,2.2039,4.8558,3.6461,1.5354,5.8616,4.6121,1.3432,5.312,0.7609,5.1637,3.5925,2.574,5.6022,4.4441,1.488,4.9153,2.1772,2.127,4.5607,1.8564,0.1348,0.0001,1.7931,5.702,0.4181,4.9922,4.881,5.542,0.7633,5.3149,3.818,2.457,0.8709,0.0001,0.8926,5.9571,5.6068,0.5441,2.6794,5.6398,2.7255,2.4841,5.082,4.6683,4.307,2.2418,1.7115,0.5095,0.6492,4.9084,5.4323,5.2162,0.5163,0.088,0.0001,4.3423,0.4067,2.5172,2.5676,0.6977,7.4877,0.4589,1.229,4.9697,0.5058,2.3905,4.8718,5.0157,0.873,0.4577,5.2763,2.1497,1.1393,0.0002,4.7642,1.1071,1.6276,1.324,0.7934,1.0079,1.5001,0.874,5.384,4.7446,0.3147,3.7434,0.0007,2.1282,5.8992,1.625,2.0364,4.4731,1.6964,0.5723,3.4319,1.936,5.0028,2.0663,4.3099,1.9954,1.2943,6.2308,0.7251,4.2469,2.2913,3.2478,4.0641,3.0319,5.077,3.3622,3.9019,0.2869,3.507,2.3911,6.0846,2.8607,4.1765,1.5056,3.8128,1.2357,0.4666,0.4884,2.3738,5.3621,4.832,3.1381,3.67,5.7802,1.6071,1.9506,3.7154,1.06,1.4931,1.298,4.5897,4.323,2.8254,0.7363,0.0591,0.6891,1.323,1.0728,0.0002,5.0887,0.4082,1.9021,0.2227,2.1193]}
{"id":2730,"ended":true,"length":620,"gen_text":"( WP ) Happiness is the national currency. After years of being fabulously wealthy, you find yourself unable to purchase anything. You never go to sleep in the way you'd prefer. You can't even sleep properly because of the heat. Eventually, you feel sorry for those around you, and that's the time it takes to go on a new life. You realize that your future was better without you. Now you live alone. This is not an easy situation. Your house is in poor repair, and you can't buy groceries. There are already plenty of shops for clothing, food and so forth, and your income doesn't go to rent. When you get a job, you are guaranteed a small bonus\u2014or, at least, you have your benefits. This is what makes the life of a small entrepreneur like you so satisfying. You work with little patience and are willing to give up any hope of becoming rich. And you can be happy with your present state of affairs. You have the experience to live a life worth living today. You won't have time to give up the idea of losing weight or be on a losing mission. The world already has a few big ideas. But your new life is worth living. You won't have to sacrifice anything to live the best life possible. The only thing that can save you from a life full of failure is a little more freedom. You can do whatever you want. This is something every teenager strives for but always at a constant risk. When you're at home as a teenager, nothing you do can even help you get to a place where you can enjoy yourself. It takes time to learn how to talk, be thoughtful, play games, read, write, and write. It takes time to develop your sense of humor. It takes time to develop a good sense of humor. If you're not able to go to the gym or take a shower you won't find yourself in the most rewarding work place. If it's just a day job you can be happy when you are free, and still be in debt or starving. If you have any personal problems, it's your ability to deal with them. Your money is less than when you were a little girl. Your time is less than when you were a baby. But if you can put everything away for good, your life will be so much better. If you think about being on the good side of anything, you'll think about living better. And you'll be happy. A little more freedom and, by extension, love. You'll see people who are much less likely to beat themselves up. You'll see people who care about their fellow humans more. You'll see people who are willing to pay less for a better quality of life. You can be happy when you live your life the way you want it to be now. Then one day someone else will buy you a house. And you'd be the only one with that one new idea and you'd be free from responsibility. Life is the greatest joy when one man finds a new vision and embraces it for himself.","token_len":623,"entropy":[12.9358,5.0822,16.8653,2.1689,2.3326,8.9629,4.8165,1.7869,7.2452,4.8734,0.0413,3.8503,11.12,0.0062,0.8278,0.4503,3.7975,4.5185,0.6516,4.231,0.0217,6.1479,1.9329,1.7983,2.0111,5.3339,4.4359,1.3197,3.8538,4.4349,1.1726,7.2069,0.4302,3.607,3.4599,0.782,1.5933,3.2159,0.8466,2.1771,4.5241,4.6828,3.3893,1.6658,1.3538,5.898,0.9015,5.8452,0.5648,0.6025,4.2524,5.344,0.013,4.553,1.6975,0.0087,1.5466,1.409,4.1062,0.8703,3.0458,4.4969,4.1131,0.0446,0.4066,4.4523,3.18,1.445,4.8382,2.4387,0.2851,2.0411,3.6659,0.6536,2.7423,4.7988,4.7998,4.3944,4.1012,0.5749,0.8552,4.6442,0.9952,4.5759,4.9605,1.5238,4.4051,0.8299,2.7497,3.2579,1.447,2.4626,1.2628,3.6564,4.4973,0.5924,3.3908,4.9718,2.5665,0.81,0.7018,0.9966,2.2434,0.301,3.4433,3.2229,1.0677,3.9573,0.8742,5.8246,3.5564,0.0243,5.5132,3.6202,5.2546,0.9098,3.0572,2.073,4.8258,2.2244,1.4292,1.287,3.3526,4.1604,3.9694,0.0002,2.1512,2.8452,4.6845,0.4405,4.3095,0.2901,2.5489,2.4658,0.4442,0.4872,0.4457,3.2295,5.1985,1.2402,4.386,5.8006,4.6468,3.501,2.1053,1.7986,0.243,0.0495,2.3462,2.7973,3.7001,5.3758,1.1958,3.5105,0.9563,2.9291,1.7943,2.8779,3.7711,0.3906,0.596,5.5076,3.418,4.2429,0.4958,0.9837,4.3365,0.2972,1.8334,4.2073,3.7423,5.0635,5.649,1.7753,4.3142,3.0721,0.0168,2.9672,0.8079,3.5238,2.8922,0.9778,4.1014,0.7486,0.9624,4.1993,1.5278,3.3328,3.3167,2.6122,2.476,1.9061,4.127,3.8347,0.2868,1.7023,0.5164,1.6569,2.2549,2.6141,5.4211,2.222,4.4567,1.5568,1.487,4.1784,0.0939,5.2836,0.4653,1.9088,5.7074,0.0022,1.7996,5.4935,0.2765,4.8034,0.1338,2.7728,2.7288,0.6704,5.7002,3.7435,2.0486,5.3093,4.2613,1.1996,4.2774,4.8078,0.4614,3.5372,3.406,6.3629,1.2404,1.6941,4.2305,4.4755,3.05,2.0011,2.8322,3.96,4.2552,1.0066,1.0356,4.3599,0.2682,1.5789,2.0163,3.7154,0.0003,1.0275,0.4708,3.7224,1.7597,1.3131,2.7536,2.7125,3.2512,0.9194,0.504,0.2273,2.9292,2.0296,1.3158,1.1743,3.3075,3.2112,0.1518,1.1988,2.5556,2.0743,3.6133,0.0005,3.3569,0.279,1.7544,2.8825,4.0957,3.1453,0.2697,1.6608,1.1683,2.8392,1.4561,0.1221,0.1693,1.2457,4.144,0.5964,4.0378,4.9273,5.3083,6.402,0.1989,5.5453,4.0898,5.9134,1.931,4.8476,1.8534,0.9249,3.9566,0.3511,2.1105,4.0307,2.5295,6.745,0.4932,0.7324,0.2032,5.8802,3.5458,0.5175,2.1798,5.8271,3.8758,0.4916,2.2062,2.2347,2.2557,2.1393,0.6228,0.1858,0.5016,2.8668,1.9271,0.6675,2.8145,2.9791,2.5213,1.3615,2.3358,1.4984,0.0174,4.8794,1.9615,4.5511,4.4894,0.4845,5.7251,2.6546,0.3911,2.7334,0.8635,1.0724,0.4852,1.3944,2.3011,0.9686,2.2589,0.2613,0.784,0.0725,3.5501,1.7722,2.9521,0.0154,0.7882,0.7327,0.8384,0.0631,0.0825,0.0334,2.557,2.1438,3.892,0.6614,0.0124,0.8864,0.3528,4.5469,0.2075,1.8493,2.0579,2.5865,0.0039,4.7713,1.1265,1.7406,1.5599,1.7315,3.5418,1.136,3.0712,5.1328,2.9386,0.0002,3.5436,2.4084,1.9697,1.8377,3.4276,4.7457,4.6446,3.2167,0.9706,2.5337,5.6677,0.5354,3.5923,1.3217,3.1347,1.8366,1.0459,1.5942,3.2971,2.8462,5.1226,0.307,3.3283,5.2151,2.8426,2.1141,4.9535,2.0626,3.3141,5.6359,4.1337,5.1079,0.5605,1.4562,0.4964,2.542,3.8047,4.6168,1.0179,1.3166,2.4532,0.6709,2.7764,6.4272,0.0044,2.2606,0.0296,0.1544,0.9573,3.2807,4.9646,1.1856,5.6527,1.4827,4.1063,0.0616,1.0186,1.7911,3.6789,2.0873,0.4413,2.0951,3.6785,0.5174,1.6008,0.1506,0.1777,0.0572,0.6737,0.6153,4.1087,0.2064,3.9678,2.4784,0.2313,2.3859,4.868,5.0699,2.1997,2.9311,4.3259,0.469,3.1207,1.29,0.5859,0.7449,4.4671,0.2486,0.6219,0.4163,2.9002,0.2627,5.0246,1.3833,5.8727,5.0494,1.4023,5.0418,0.0853,0.3083,4.4852,0.4704,1.2453,1.4842,3.6068,0.6132,3.723,4.1959,0.6495,2.8612,1.9697,0.3937,1.6024,1.8795,0.7899,4.681,2.51,1.6418,0.473,2.4212,5.6029,4.1668,0.3174,0.001,4.6454,0.9477,2.8756,1.0451,4.627,4.0536,1.5911,1.3438,4.5559,2.8758,2.9432,0.041,5.3717,0.9662,0.1296,2.0685,0.7453,0.1359,1.0286,0.5246,0.1004,4.8106,1.2801,1.2489,4.906,2.3886,1.5328,1.195,0.3734,0.0899,0.4455,0.3395,0.1123,1.6731,2.4564,0.0183,4.5533,3.4319,0.7983,2.8314,1.5401,3.6353,0.0674,0.0129,0.4199,0.5549,4.8812,2.123,1.417,3.0629,0.209,2.8018,2.3234,0.233,2.3022,0.0769,0.307,0.4211,0.9356,0.4328,0.0341,3.5062,0.4498,6.0022,5.8124,0.0093,4.2963,1.5815,0.243,5.4514,0.5155,0.5194,2.2687,0.9281,2.5444,0.9356,4.4075,0.8606,3.5219,2.9546,0.1421,3.4547,2.117,3.4981,5.0172,2.7495,3.6897,1.8797,0.1442,0.7055,3.7874,3.3735,6.2584,0.8261,5.344,0.858,4.0845,3.1507,3.7871,4.6407,4.6683,3.5484,5.2403,1.8491,2.035,5.8577,1.4702,5.5168,0.177,3.3252,1.717,0.2532]}
{"id":4331,"ended":false,"length":587,"gen_text":"You are Glue. So far, your attempts to stop your archenemy, Rubber, from destroying the world have proved futile.\n\nHowever, that did not stop your teammates from trying to kill yourself\n\nEveryone around you\n\nWith all the knowledge you have gained and the love for everyone that you have, it is hard to ignore the fact that you have been forced to become more important than ever before after your defeat. The more people see this, the more they will seek to destroy us so that we can give up, and the more likely this will happen, we shall be forced to leave our people alone.\n\nYou and I\n\nIt would be easy enough to talk about our personal differences, but here's a quick comparison: your boyfriends, girlfriends, siblings, and your friends. I am very grateful to you for helping with the hard work that you have put into helping your parents, your family, your friends, and your school, and not just getting along with your parents.\n\nHowever, some of the other things I love about you may be the difference in how you treat your friends or your family. Some may be just a little bit too protective of your boyfriend, your girlfriend, or your friends. On the other hand, one of the things that has helped me most is giving into your own feelings of inadequacy and inadequacy, and giving them more time without any real thought. This is something that I would do the same at any moment in time.\n\nI've always loved to be held in a way that I felt would give me a better understanding of my own mental state. If you are unable to give, then you can't help but be treated like a piece of garbage in this world.\n\nNow my boyfriend is not a complete garbage person, which is why I am glad that my friend is not in any way inferior to you. However, I think that there is something much more fundamental about what you consider superior in this world and one that can only be ignored!\n\nIf you truly believe that we could bring happiness in this world by becoming more, not less, then one day you will be the happiest person you can be. In any form or form.\n\nThis has been part of my life since I was 19, and one day is just one day of my life now. So I hope that someday, if I don't have to make a difference now, my friend won't be forced to make a difference at all with who, where, where, where, where, where this world needs me.\n\nIf you are ever facing one of these challenges that would really be so frustrating, I wish you the most of the best of luck in your journey. Let all of these challenges become your defining feature so that there's no future in the world of living with this problem.\n\nFinally, thanks for reading this novel, and the wonderful, amazing writing that you did here on Kindle, which I really love. Thank you so much!\n\nSincerely,\n\nBeverly Love","token_len":624,"entropy":[3.8827,11.7423,4.3244,3.7395,5.5209,4.8666,1.127,3.7763,5.6492,0.6265,4.6527,3.6811,8.9223,3.6292,0.1128,4.3363,12.6795,2.3906,1.0921,4.0135,1.9548,3.1681,0.8726,4.243,1.3759,0.2993,2.4207,0.0299,4.2884,0.0663,4.8994,3.8025,0.0241,0.3259,2.6881,5.4358,0.2374,2.9377,0.4324,3.3144,5.9821,7.4974,0.0003,5.9934,4.9925,0.2366,4.7702,0.0002,5.146,2.8386,1.3635,5.3515,1.2658,0.5989,1.6243,3.678,1.8337,5.1733,4.1015,6.043,3.7796,0.6144,0.5619,1.9226,3.0475,0.7777,3.5637,0.3012,4.2164,1.0752,0.6177,0.0441,1.1085,1.5694,2.455,5.206,0.1576,4.1248,3.4742,3.8966,1.2483,1.3367,2.4719,7.1752,2.3232,2.5837,0.785,4.1159,3.8197,3.0828,5.6696,3.4433,0.7596,0.0369,0.343,1.4624,0.9203,4.9974,0.81,2.5079,5.8948,5.0204,0.4944,0.4003,0.9217,6.1638,1.2676,3.4519,1.3384,1.4155,0.2971,3.6923,3.442,0.3024,1.3881,0.6215,5.0917,2.7899,2.0959,1.5894,0.0571,3.389,2.563,5.2809,2.5296,0.4959,0.4013,0.0002,3.0654,4.0726,2.7753,1.4339,0.0002,3.5574,4.0457,0.558,2.5777,3.1818,0.2601,4.0927,0.304,2.3129,5.2233,3.1098,0.8821,0.4077,4.7093,3.2966,1.956,2.6713,4.9742,1.8396,4.3081,6.0575,3.5926,2.3639,4.4064,0.2871,4.439,0.2996,0.9487,2.8839,2.8579,1.5664,4.1851,2.038,4.3816,4.2705,1.2588,0.6431,0.535,2.6908,5.0192,2.0513,6.0539,0.1707,1.7879,1.0962,1.1629,1.2537,0.9232,2.5392,3.6938,4.8967,1.7011,2.0182,2.8291,0.1031,1.6678,0.9591,0.1197,0.4427,1.0589,4.0604,2.7521,1.2403,5.2713,2.248,5.4932,3.6837,0.6631,1.9051,2.7063,0.8695,1.1272,0.0001,4.3495,0.0319,5.554,0.9424,1.5683,4.2423,2.3638,2.3925,4.1774,0.408,0.5627,4.6058,1.7785,2.6938,4.8553,1.25,2.0375,0.417,2.9616,1.6994,2.5094,3.8689,1.2936,0.7814,0.4504,3.8251,2.1052,0.9913,3.9839,2.5038,1.1755,0.8613,2.4772,4.461,0.8823,1.6654,4.3722,2.2286,4.3394,1.389,0.0582,0.6231,0.3288,2.4374,0.9517,5.6337,0.1992,0.3126,0.0303,0.0271,5.5375,0.775,0.599,0.5646,0.8071,3.8559,2.4174,0.6231,2.0871,1.0294,5.1037,6.3268,1.1965,4.5131,2.3962,1.54,2.6785,0.0043,1.1937,3.1074,0.0252,2.0269,0.8974,3.3606,3.1135,3.5232,2.196,6.802,3.2362,3.0203,3.7667,1.4952,3.4782,1.1181,2.7059,0.5576,1.0485,3.2234,3.2084,4.8146,0.4364,6.2367,1.0611,1.8187,2.5857,3.1631,0.7766,0.4922,0.0002,2.1204,3.9975,2.4918,2.3057,2.2928,2.3346,5.4837,1.4369,1.6362,3.4985,0.3904,1.4347,3.1824,4.4233,3.3635,0.3595,1.7336,2.4577,2.2577,0.1038,1.5576,1.3039,5.0282,0.7727,0.8889,3.7148,1.752,2.0398,4.5255,0.035,3.6593,5.3589,2.5617,1.0781,2.8311,1.1832,2.7137,0.514,2.157,5.4332,1.8383,0.7499,2.6623,0.0138,1.4729,4.0163,2.5382,0.8884,0.3253,1.5224,0.0002,4.5449,5.893,2.4771,2.009,3.0067,2.1709,5.0083,4.0722,3.4904,1.1781,5.1628,0.7457,1.3633,0.5533,2.2143,4.4568,0.9647,4.0656,3.4532,2.4772,2.2128,3.6299,3.5605,0.3589,4.3298,0.26,1.983,0.4066,3.2914,0.0271,1.5596,3.077,0.7988,3.1793,0.8345,1.5521,3.5544,0.4476,5.1911,1.2767,3.763,1.3006,5.8666,4.279,3.0025,2.2956,0.2331,3.2544,5.6076,0.4533,3.6462,1.826,0.1851,4.7193,6.0185,0.3427,0.0002,3.5141,0.4699,4.3324,1.6409,0.4588,4.4087,5.1784,5.8225,3.6323,3.4163,0.5213,0.0426,3.3628,3.6116,1.015,3.9763,2.6194,0.06,0.8911,4.5586,5.5163,1.0689,0.8324,0.4933,1.6371,3.9004,2.9973,0.8558,2.6719,2.4583,0.4894,0.7417,4.4406,4.4904,5.226,1.4243,1.0569,3.0485,0.686,0.0002,3.8024,4.924,0.9687,5.121,0.0226,0.3414,1.4394,1.2202,0.6045,0.4952,5.6998,1.525,0.6135,4.9925,0.8719,5.9571,4.0982,4.803,0.5143,3.2315,1.3435,0.1084,4.9223,0.3307,3.896,2.021,2.2976,0.4948,3.8232,1.9774,4.4616,1.1205,4.2029,0.0004,2.2241,0.4445,3.9201,1.8309,5.0905,4.0332,0.4115,3.0498,2.4362,4.9075,0.0002,1.3749,5.5091,0.119,1.9978,0.3431,0.4082,1.8334,0.0441,6.4465,6.1801,7.7333,2.8689,0.1385,3.1248,0.5053,1.223,0.4739,0.6117,0.4298,0.4238,6.8476,1.7393,5.0267,1.9049,1.7427,0.5108,0.0002,2.8575,0.5239,1.7514,4.8618,5.4865,5.5116,0.2312,0.7328,2.6669,3.2792,4.2171,4.0834,3.1351,3.5511,4.3321,0.855,2.4217,4.6519,0.301,1.2582,2.8498,0.2629,1.2992,0.3791,1.7113,0.0429,1.3245,0.5598,2.3831,1.2474,5.7579,6.6484,0.6934,4.1736,3.3543,4.3292,2.1103,5.2783,3.677,4.3072,0.1092,4.8717,3.6706,1.1704,4.761,3.1041,2.223,0.6959,2.4952,6.0266,1.5547,2.507,2.9965,0.613,0.5246,0.0002,5.9136,0.0652,4.4706,0.4142,0.3516,2.201,6.3436,1.4588,1.1199,4.9768,4.5584,4.5569,3.9439,3.9582,1.4616,0.6749,2.5462,4.5301,2.9628,6.3527,2.9975,3.6209,1.6224,3.1113,2.5303,0.5995,3.8226,0.0112,1.6543,0.0249,2.1692,0.8138,0.0002,4.7015,0.0006,0.0311,0.1967,0.0003,4.099,4.3701,0.1514,6.2491]}

{"id":2241,"ended":true,"length":604,"gen_text":"Your roommate is 2nd most powerful superhero in the world and he will not shut up about it. He does not yet know that you are the 1st.\n\n. He does not yet know that you are the 1st. He will not admit he is mentally retarded. He did not take any medication to prevent depression.\n\n. He did not take any medication to prevent depression. He did not make up his minds or admit he is mentally retarded. He may feel he has no understanding on the subject he has just told you. However, it is easy to talk to your neighbor or friend about the problem. It will leave no room for disagreement or trouble. The only one who knows can change things for you.\n\n. She was the first to come to our house and you had no idea what she did. She asked you to try to get your hands on some stuff but her own hands told her she would make your parents happy and help you build your confidence. As far as I can tell her was the only person who knew about this so you said no you won't tell anyone. She was the first person who did this and when she said that she had some information about the relationship that you had with your boyfriend, your girlfriend and your boyfriend's father, you asked him to give her some free time. The first thing he did was change the way your car moved. He did what she said so you wouldn't go to your car with him.\n\nAt first the roommate had no idea this stuff was happening. She then decided to find some more free time and had some money. She went out into local shopping and bought some t-shirts that she kept in her office and gave them to customers using her debit card. When she realized this she took them with her at my place. She found all their supplies and began to build her confidence and that of her boyfriend, then she gave them to you. Her relationship with her boyfriend ended when the relationship was over. She was the first person that did this. She was happy when you gave her free time, but you went into your house and did not want your boyfriend, or any other boyfriend.\n\nWhen her boyfriend took your friend away and gave you a little money to pay for medication again she said, you're not going to allow my boyfriend to turn you around and throw your phone in your face now. So she gave that money away on the condition we will not pay for it now.

In another report posted in the USMC Archives this month, former USAF F-35 pilot Michael C. Johnson reported that the Marine Corps \"has developed, and continues to develop a new combat aircraft to meet the needs of its growing forces. It won't be the first or last Marine to replace any of our existing F-35B and F-16 fighter aircraft with such a weapon, but it is the most significant milestone in its development.\" The new USMC F-15 Joint Strike Fighter, which will replace the old USMC AN\/AP-86A, will be the fifth military aircraft the newly acquired USAF F-16 is developing, due to the same technology (the latest F-15E and F-16E\/F). The aircraft will now be based on two different jets, and will reportedly use multiple engines to increase range further. The current F-16 has a 6,300 mile range and a 5,800 range but with an 8,000 mile range. According to Air Force records, both of these new F-16s, F-18E\/F-18E Growler jets, will share a single twin fw. The current F-16 and F-18E\/F-18E\/F-22 Joint Strike Fighter are based on the same F-16A Hornet A2 engine. The F-22 Joint Strike Fighter uses the same F-15's twin turbojet.

{"id":2004,"ended":true,"length":591,"gen_text":"You hide your valuable carved pipe on a hill for safekeeping during travels. While away, train robbers bury their stolen treasure on the same hill. On return, you can't tell the train robbers why you want to climb the hill, and the Robbers can't tell you why they distrust your motives.\n\nAvoid risky situations in the future\n\nAvoid situations that can prove to be deadly because of other factors such as the weather, weather conditions and the way you look to yourself. Use the latest information about risky situations to keep yourself and others safe.\n\nAvoid safe events before they occur and when they may occur\n\nIt is important that you avoid situations where you are threatened and then give up, such as the weather. When you have finished waiting for the train, wait with your body and the train. While travelling, wait on a train track or a road, with your feet behind you and in front of your head.\n\nAvoid dangerous conditions\n\nBe careful while you travel to and from places like mountains. Make sure that you have a guide ready to guide you to your destination. You can often get stuck, so make sure you have a guide ready to guide you. Sometimes things can happen very unexpectedly so stay with your guide or get yourself in a car, or you can get on the train and have a ride to a higher country.\n\nMake sure your journey is very safe. When travelling, the safest way is to be careful about what you plan to do next.\n\nAvoid dangerous conditions\n\nRemember that things can happen so quickly. If you don't know how to make things happen, you could wind up in a situation that is really dangerous that you are planning to do nothing about. For example, avoid the same mountain or road that your journey took you to. If you don't know how, then you can wind up in a predicament you are planning to avoid.\n\nAvoid dangerous situations at the beginning\n\nAlways wait at the very beginning of your journey, and then try to do it in less than. The worst circumstances will make the time easier for you because you will not be waiting. Remember that time limits will be different than before your journey. Sometimes, you might still start you journey, but it might not be as short, so it might get harder for you. Don't lose any time at the start of your journey by having time limits.\n\nAvoid dangerous situations early\n\nThere is usually danger at night, just try to be safe, and give your guide at least 2 years to keep you safe.\n\nNever give up. If there is danger near you, take precautions to protect yourself.

Eventually he makes up his mind to make a new one to use him, but he's told he's done with it and is forced to settle for a few more things after finding out the thief is a man named Richard, and that he might have to put his life on the line for protection.\n\nGideon turns him into a man of some sort, which makes him feel bad that he could have become so much better for it, since he is, with a simple idea, what a genius he is. But later on, he loses the ring and can't be trusted to stay alive. When Sauron tries to start a rebellion against him, he goes from being a fool to someone who will fall for his schemes and not return.\n\nLive-Action TV\n\nLive Action TV\n\nMusic\n\nMajor hits\n\nDuring T.I.'S and the other band's first album, a young, unkempt, teenage band from Paris (known as \"Eternal Light\") were named \"The Magician's Alliance\"; they also had two bandaged boys.\n\nThe band is named after \"magician\", an imaginary group of wizards and sorcerers.\n\nAnime and Manga\n\nIn The Magical Book of G.I.

Gandalf had only been born 3 year old at the time, yet still wanted his family to know that it was their baby son.

{"id":1580,"ended":true,"length":569,"gen_text":"Only a time traveling Adolf Hitler dressed as Batman can unravel the dark and mysterious secret behind the numbers that appeared over everyone's heads at Hogwarts.\n\nNatalie Jones in the role of Mary Poppins.\n\nThe comic book characters of The Twilight Zone have been cast in this classic fantasy adventure, set to be the latest installment in a trilogy called Lord of the Flies.\n\nA dark history of crime\n\nThe author Peter MacKay explains he designed the series and the series' story with his son, J.K. MacKay, who was born into the wealthy family in 1940 with two other children.\n\n\"I wanted to have a character who would be able to live out the rest of his life the way he did his stories,\" says Mr. MacKay, 59, who has written 14 books including The Silmarillion, The New Mutants and The Dark Knight Rises.\n\nHis book, which appeared in 2007, won the 2011 Hugo Award in the award-winning series, which launched the show's 20th season.\n\nWhile he doesn't reveal specific dates of the series, Mr. MacKay says he hopes to set a few themes up.\n\n\"To me, there was no reason not to put the stories together,\" he says. \"Why not get something so different in each episode so hopefully we can sort of understand what is going on around the group of people and what is happening around those group.\"\n\n\nHe also says he would like to put a more traditional character element to the series -- that of a child struggling with one's past, growing up through the pressures of the dark world, and eventually getting himself back into the light.\n\n\"They're so dark in this story I feel very strongly about my characters,\" he says. \"I wanted to keep that darker story of a young girl struggling with something that's far deeper.\"\n\n\nIt is one part of the mystery of the Wizarding World. The other being that it is one of many worlds that Dumbledore was introduced into.\n\nThe story will tell of Professor McGonagall's escape, what she did to Dumbledore at the wizarding age, how she overcame her past, and what happened to Harry.\n\nBut even as part of the show's plot, it will focus on the Dark Wizard Voldemort, whose ultimate goal is for Sirius and the others to become Voldemort's minions.\n\n\"I think I really want to go over that first line of the entire series,\" he says, noting that \"we're going to see people who are very aware that they're going to be seeing a great deal of that darkness and that darkness itself, as well.\"\n\nThe show's cast included the aforementioned two books: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, and Harry Potter and the Goblet

{"id":4524,"ended":true,"length":609,"gen_text":"Humans are now like cats wherein they have 9 lives. You remember each prior life and death. You are on life 9 of 9. You are going to die in the way that those people on life 9 of 9 wish you were.\n\nSo then you are going to need to make a decision. You are going to choose a life that you like. You have chosen to live your life according to your emotions. Now you live your life according to all three points, and each of these four points is where life 9 of 9 is, and so it is your choosing that has changed your life.\n\nFor people who were raised this way, I think that there were a lot of differences between the way children were raised. Maybe what they were taught is that you had to know what to do. One example that I have used in my career was some children were taught that they have to do things to survive. I think that is wrong because they had to deal with things that they never had to deal with.\n\nSo so some of the other things that you have taught them, the other things they did in their life, they will not learn in a million years like that. If you are going to teach them to live life according to your emotions, they will not learn. When your children were taught that they can do whatever they feel like then I think that that would be wrong because there are other things that are taught to them that is wrong. Why the heck should they learn in a million years.\n\nIn that situation, I don't think we are done yet. I will talk to your kids about what their learning needs to be if they are going to be happy in their life right now. That is their learning needs. I want my kids to learn that they can do things in life to which they're not comfortable and that if they do, then they might want to take things different to make them happy.\n\nSo I want them to make it out in a different manner. If they move to college, that may be their learning needs for life. Whether or not they want to go, it may be their learning needs for life. And the way that you can turn that into a better education for them is that you can turn that into a better health.\n\nWhen we grow up and we do all these things so that we are able to think about what has the world's worst possible effects. That is what we need to be able to do. If we are going to turn it into a better health education for them, that is what we need to be able to do.\n\nYou see, that is good teaching and we are going to turn it into better health education for them. And it's going to turn it into a better health education for them that they wouldn't get in their early 30's otherwise.\n\nSo it is good teaching.

{"id":2082,"ended":true,"length":578,"gen_text":"( WP ) It's lonely at the top, where I live. My boyfriend is really smart and fun. The other girls are like, 'Oh, hi' and 'Can I date you?\"\n\n- My boyfriend\n\nIt's hard to put into words what she has been up to. How do you feel before she said anything? The answer to all three questions is a resounding, \"YES! No!\" Every relationship seems to start with the idea that this relationship is going to be rocky with two of them.\n\nI'm so sorry I didn't know. I'm sorry that I didn't see this one coming. Is that true for your relationship now?\n\n- Your boyfriends words\n\nIs the love you've been trying to express?\n\nIt's a great question to answer. Can your relationship be broken?\n\n- Your girlfriend\n\nYour girlfriend isn't your boyfriend\n\nYour boyfriend is your best friends\n\nI love you too.. I love you too.\n\n- Your boyfriends words\n\nYou already told me about this one.\n\nWe met when we were very young. I knew you were going to give her the best chance of ever being back (she had already started dating your boyfriend, right?). How did she know? She was the best girl you ever had.\n\nEven though you could always tell that you would let her know. Was she always there, always ready for that? Or was she just like you? Did she tell you that you were the very best she'd ever been, and that was the best date ever?\n\n- Your girlfriend\n\nI feel very confident at my age. I feel very confident being a good partner. I am confident that my boyfriend is my best friend. And that you will be my best friend.\n\n- Your boyfriends words\n\nDon't just let it slide. If you never even spoke up about me before, you're dead wrong. You're living the lie that you've been here for so long to be so proud of the girl you love. My relationship with your boyfriend isn't what I've been talking about before, but what I've been talking about with you for the past 4 years.\n\nWith each word she gave me, I'd smile with happiness and then I'd cry and I'd laugh together over the course of our date. She knows that. This relationship is so strong. You know it's this strength because you've been here so long. You have known this for so long. You've done everything you could to convince her that you wanted my best boyfriend.\n\nWe just made love. We've been talking for so many years...\n\n- Your boyfriends words\n\nIt's your love for me that's more important.

{"id":1399,"ended":false,"length":581,"gen_text":"You belong to the 1 % of humanity with superhuman abilities. But powers are never straightforward. For example, your best friend is pyrokinetic - but whenever she used her abilities, she's left with burns that vary in severity. Your powers, however, are a whole new level of complicated.\n\n. For example, your best friend is pyrokinetic - but whenever she used her abilities, she's left with burns that vary in severity. Your powers, however, are a whole new level of complex. Your powers are determined by who you are or what you do. If your powers are just about 'power, and you have powers less than 'power', that's it. If you're a hero who has super powers, it's always so important that your character can perform the most devastating abilities on the ground. Power can be hard to come by with your powers. Just don't use powers that don't do what they say.\n\n...\n\nIf the hero is a nobleman or queen but lacks an ordinary heart, then that's your problem, otherwise, you must find your strength and overcome that weakness. Just think of yourself as a hero who has abilities so much that you have powers beyond those that make up yourself yourself.\n\nThat said, if you feel that your situation is hopelessly hopeless, then you should really fight for what your life is trying to do.\n\nWhat are Powers\n\nBeing power, however, comes with two different levels. Powers start off as easy - you have to 'power-up' the character by mastering each of them individually. Once you do the same, you can use your powers to overcome that weakness as effectively as you can. The more power you have, the more power-that-any-kind character has.\n\nBut power doesn't have a monopoly on strength. Powers can also be used to improve other characters by giving them an advantage. One way to do this is by giving yourself powers that give you a power advantage over other characters. If you are playing a hero with super powers that limit fighting abilities - you will not be winning. You will just have an unyielding 'power force' that stops fighting.\n\nBut super powers could be used to have something of greater help in any situation. To say that powers help me out is an overly simplified version of a true 'power fight'. In any situation, you can play it safe. The more you focus on 'power-ability,' the more your strengths and weaknesses become greater. Thus, if you want to succeed in fighting, you'll need to focus on more than just your strength. A power is always better, and you'll always get to use it better than someone who knows that they can use it.\n\nYou can often play with your powers and increase your power, but it's better to be able to show that to your opponents before all of these powers become your weak spots.\n\n...\n\nThere's More Than one category of powers (if you're playing a character that has a special ability called 'Power-Ability')","token_len":628,"entropy":[9.062,0.6848,1.7147,7.5602,5.3717,2.0578,3.1895,4.955,8.6663,1.8375,1.5412,4.4393,10.6702,2.166,4.7591,9.5423,0.566,4.5485,2.2271,0.2036,4.0779,6.0777,1.0802,1.5417,11.7133,1.4584,1.2293,0.0723,5.4026,3.9692,8.4428,3.7665,6.7262,1.8611,3.6098,1.1783,1.3482,5.2629,5.7841,1.374,8.6443,3.3642,6.5901,2.0252,2.2763,0.8391,3.6348,4.9303,3.7836,1.77,0.1308,0.7561,4.542,4.8005,2.8123,0.764,1.1438,6.5832,0.7928,2.5842,0.0171,7.6051,4.8846,0.1147,0.0009,0.028,0.0024,0.0017,0.0027,0.0471,0.0007,0.0003,0.0007,0.0091,0.0071,0.0021,0.0013,0.0019,0.0063,0.0008,0.0003,0.0048,0.0031,0.0005,0.0007,0.0176,0.0013,0.0108,0.0008,0.0005,0.0017,0.0103,0.0048,0.0005,0.0032,0.001,0.0105,0.0018,0.0009,0.0009,0.0013,0.0007,3.6937,0.0049,2.3247,2.1477,0.8495,4.9505,0.2146,4.5473,0.3454,0.7662,4.7262,0.8627,0.3431,1.6662,0.626,3.1224,2.1124,0.8262,0.6973,5.0225,3.8842,6.1329,3.6074,4.6117,4.2921,1.0917,2.7967,3.3051,6.3374,0.8068,3.2371,0.3671,0.5018,3.3831,1.2072,2.9542,0.2188,2.0956,0.9896,1.0866,2.2711,4.9002,2.9569,2.2646,4.1231,1.4334,0.4458,3.0648,0.3393,5.1867,5.8008,4.4473,1.1109,3.1363,4.6053,3.7485,5.0521,2.9569,2.5839,5.0217,3.7476,3.6382,0.875,5.4657,0.5927,6.1794,3.2066,1.024,4.8633,0.3024,1.8147,0.0033,4.9072,3.0313,2.3713,1.9853,5.6579,3.2748,0.0007,3.6733,2.394,0.9855,2.7125,0.0006,4.4542,1.5855,1.5209,2.3024,1.4667,0.8397,0.0003,5.4631,1.7608,0.0003,3.3811,3.3983,4.5156,1.6332,1.8448,6.0116,1.9737,1.8302,4.8493,5.5541,4.2568,3.9821,5.6345,5.2815,0.4775,2.3613,3.2756,0.6755,4.4977,2.3677,2.7071,6.1336,1.7977,1.4247,4.7726,4.0624,3.2305,4.2597,1.9116,3.2747,3.4361,1.9117,0.4482,5.5604,3.8543,1.0142,3.6114,0.3398,0.86,2.462,1.963,1.7811,5.6406,5.4181,2.9045,1.6978,1.1842,2.8634,4.5666,3.4861,3.7126,2.2894,4.1352,1.7891,5.7868,7.8043,0.2249,0.968,0.0004,4.5979,2.048,0.0614,2.0899,0.6301,4.7752,1.7698,1.3651,6.3973,0.5547,2.3419,2.8167,1.4946,0.6072,0.9623,0.9488,2.122,4.8538,5.4937,1.571,2.4982,4.4269,4.0742,1.2741,4.4153,0.0107,2.4607,0.6574,1.8649,0.0004,4.6344,2.901,6.3675,2.6594,0.0002,5.9273,4.4664,3.4067,4.828,0.1236,4.0278,0.5542,4.6886,3.4985,2.8057,1.2081,5.129,5.3227,1.7718,0.9952,5.5601,3.8851,1.9174,2.2976,1.9925,5.8086,2.6169,3.455,0.301,0.3395,3.6474,1.6801,3.0634,5.4411,5.6854,1.3527,2.3241,4.1242,0.5988,4.0927,0.3174,2.2167,5.1951,3.5565,0.9219,0.9189,1.4277,2.785,1.7947,0.3432,0.5493,4.1983,4.696,0.9078,4.0217,4.23,0.0276,0.7787,0.4811,0.8591,4.0719,2.1063,2.1718,0.1709,0.3362,0.2472,0.0186,0.6222,2.6103,5.8738,6.2078,0.5901,6.1864,0.5461,4.3245,3.2999,2.2598,0.3376,0.5414,0.0003,4.3747,2.3541,2.5652,0.0009,2.17,3.115,4.5593,0.7166,3.2296,0.5775,3.5665,1.3179,3.0772,0.6261,1.7083,0.6591,4.0631,3.5918,0.8619,3.8689,2.6736,0.154,4.2296,1.3226,1.319,4.4855,2.1412,0.5565,0.5916,0.2972,0.0719,1.0945,1.5469,4.6726,2.3427,1.4432,2.9088,0.4533,1.9649,4.3136,0.7192,1.795,1.3574,0.1507,0.5146,3.4546,0.4963,3.2273,4.7644,1.0996,2.4889,1.4494,2.7579,0.3345,3.5301,5.8111,6.1309,1.3188,3.8492,2.091,2.9772,3.806,0.8239,5.7291,2.0831,1.6956,0.3671,2.9412,2.6945,3.2559,5.3386,3.4911,0.0052,5.4409,1.1562,6.7132,0.5822,1.1254,5.1197,2.0015,1.2427,0.7316,0.0003,3.7498,5.8864,0.6594,5.9594,1.5832,0.8227,0.3253,4.9457,5.1474,1.4508,5.5984,5.8247,2.0224,4.3912,0.6802,0.5424,4.8298,3.4157,0.5358,3.6809,2.8856,5.0875,3.4164,1.3989,0.9222,6.4085,4.531,2.4936,0.0095,3.3664,3.4709,1.6495,0.3475,6.0279,0.4784,3.2555,4.13,0.8304,0.8544,1.5165,1.9736,5.5065,3.0458,1.5201,2.2225,3.614,2.4721,2.0099,5.3186,0.1003,3.5061,0.5432,2.6457,5.6708,3.0124,0.0347,0.5493,3.2061,5.6057,1.339,0.1245,2.0582,3.569,0.3348,6.4815,0.2335,2.1873,0.4491,2.8677,0.2572,5.1144,1.1358,3.1539,1.3073,0.4074,2.9278,0.8438,0.5834,2.2275,0.3698,3.8982,1.3921,0.6202,2.0681,2.9037,0.5177,5.1118,3.2683,2.6159,4.3201,3.2242,4.7271,1.6307,2.3811,1.7311,1.4793,3.1724,3.4073,2.3804,0.5438,2.2204,2.4541,3.5838,1.9058,6.0164,3.6893,2.5088,1.4678,2.6726,0.6194,1.5666,0.3182,0.0003,3.5861,1.2043,5.4991,3.6084,2.1001,2.1844,0.4188,2.5699,5.4573,1.4598,2.1183,2.8726,0.8643,2.4083,0.7643,3.6923,0.1759,3.0183,1.9686,0.0033,5.4812,2.2399,3.6455,1.7845,2.5852,3.9344,6.9402,1.7064,4.4683,1.8289,2.9502,3.765,4.9477,1.4935,0.1349,1.1134,0.0003,4.097,0.068,0.0002,3.8728,1.5555,5.4213,0.8287,3.7653,5.9492,0.1608,0.5979,5.0145,4.9988,0.4393,1.5264,2.304,1.2206,3.078,2.7203,1.6595,2.3372,4.6097,1.2874,3.555,0.8321,2.3568,2.4399,3.9976,1.7099]}
{"id":2187,"ended":true,"length":583,"gen_text":"In the distant future, the human race has incredible technology but is running low on resources. Finally, they discover a resource rich planet - but it's got sentient life with modern-day equivalent technology.\n\nHowever, that technology is coming to earth and on many other planets\n\nThe fact is that planet's technology is also there and we are trying to utilize that technology to our advantage\n\nThis could change once life on those planets reaches us. How do you use them so that they's resources meet our needs?\n\nAt what point do you start giving people that technology?\n\nWe're going to do some smart things we're not always sure of, and we'll show you how to do it better\n\nIn any case we've done our best to educate the public of that technology for over a decade.\n\nNow a large percentage of people in general will not learn about the technology or any new technology because they don't want to make the changes, and they won't know what they're going to do in the future\n\nOur goal is to have people learn some of the key technologies. We want them to be taught about things they'll be able to get on their own and on their own, not just based on the technologies or by some sort of code they might have already put in place, instead of by some set of rules which will set them right.\n\nI think these technologies are already there. How we will make the changes is a lot of work we're going to do but we'll let you know.\n\nAnd that's what they want to know. The people will learn the technologies and we will make sure we're making sure that the tech we use comes from places, and that's not a secret\n\nSo what are the changes for the future? I know my little girl can read all kinds of information which is why I gave up that technology when she was younger.\n\nSo what will be the next time those technologies meet your needs?\n\nI don't want to have it say 'don't touch this'', I want it say 'don't touch him '.\n\nI want them to not get frustrated when I tell them not to touch 'him because they're too small.\n\nYou know how they do it sometimes you 'l be afraid. They can put a lot of fear in your heart and your heart should be broken and you think 'don't touch that.\n\nEven if they do touch'him, it will be less dangerous because there isn't enough space, space means you'll never meet new people for this to work.\n\nSo why should we care if it's not that big of a deal if it's what we want?\n\nI'm happy that they're talking about all of these things. They are not big deal. It's something we can all agree on.\n\nThey may think 'don't touch this ', they may think 'I don't want to touch my computer ', they may think 'don't touch my home '.\n\nWell, I think that's their opinion.","token_len":629,"entropy":[2.6222,8.2167,0.5904,0.1687,1.9199,4.4241,0.3713,2.5835,9.6838,4.48,5.1231,3.1785,6.8402,3.0497,0.0663,1.5926,0.7139,7.8058,0.1276,4.1279,5.7055,1.5364,7.2972,4.5772,3.2914,5.0841,3.6677,2.0179,0.7937,6.3483,9.149,1.5308,4.8169,10.3241,4.1951,0.0246,8.8223,2.7556,0.6834,2.1613,0.0123,6.1794,0.0756,4.7449,2.9256,0.9745,5.1821,1.0831,6.6362,2.5909,5.767,5.5306,2.4983,0.4613,7.3649,0.0003,2.1062,5.8381,1.553,0.8595,6.0545,4.5851,2.015,0.6921,4.8771,5.0122,2.279,3.559,1.5831,4.4394,0.0435,5.9052,2.6176,0.672,0.9602,2.6363,0.1753,3.7102,0.0003,3.3174,4.4872,3.6515,5.3812,6.4607,1.094,6.1287,0.8221,3.4485,3.6345,1.0514,5.2335,2.3033,1.2765,2.7502,4.3208,5.0778,1.1423,1.5719,8.8661,8.2622,5.86,1.4643,0.2092,0.6152,0.7741,0.0002,5.5581,3.9836,0.3165,1.1055,0.6408,2.3913,5.7692,2.8424,4.3077,0.5561,1.1676,0.3861,0.0002,2.8571,2.2677,2.9828,0.0642,4.0873,3.1849,5.3862,1.2625,6.5358,1.6108,1.2627,5.2499,3.0396,2.2709,1.6798,1.8647,1.3819,2.019,5.7162,1.1059,1.3352,1.4835,0.8258,0.8377,4.3386,2.3186,0.0002,3.8207,4.8993,0.4623,4.5017,2.8743,3.1217,3.836,0.6572,0.3967,5.4125,1.8696,0.9965,4.2919,3.3516,1.1265,4.7454,4.6448,1.0479,0.5325,1.4263,1.4736,0.0001,3.858,5.4472,5.049,2.89,0.0407,1.6813,2.8736,4.9376,3.2482,1.6418,4.455,0.7152,1.9497,1.1686,3.6344,4.8191,4.1904,1.4705,3.4122,0.8,1.2882,0.0005,1.8107,0.1384,5.3579,2.057,4.4025,4.0304,2.2411,1.5552,3.1427,0.0003,2.5974,1.5774,1.8965,0.805,2.2353,0.0521,1.6981,3.4691,0.6013,0.2758,1.9673,0.0001,5.0216,2.3181,0.3149,0.2758,3.3339,1.8241,1.9823,6.2883,1.0493,0.6885,5.3844,1.6177,3.2801,2.1007,2.2244,1.5189,0.0923,1.5828,4.8812,1.3344,4.3104,2.3719,3.3543,1.8664,0.9962,0.0031,4.6096,3.7642,1.2366,0.194,2.2878,4.2898,0.1826,0.0298,2.8306,2.6936,1.9359,6.1219,0.1151,2.3526,3.6791,3.856,3.1517,4.1302,3.4372,0.0038,5.4704,3.5755,3.5458,1.1553,4.3241,5.5632,0.9663,2.3705,2.5611,7.068,0.3397,3.0136,2.3709,4.7733,0.1589,1.7126,4.1379,2.649,5.1494,0.9816,5.4919,0.9031,0.2374,0.0001,3.8149,1.3637,5.1574,1.7275,0.963,3.8486,1.7463,1.8463,5.2857,3.3924,3.7559,3.0178,3.2185,1.8002,2.0358,2.4237,2.98,0.8024,1.3631,3.9595,1.2191,1.6893,0.0087,1.1011,3.8599,1.2314,2.3636,4.3967,0.5211,0.6901,2.5413,0.3597,0.0002,4.1205,2.8743,0.3908,2.2096,5.2535,2.9435,0.8705,1.4927,1.1106,4.3954,3.1106,3.0045,3.1719,3.1578,1.9331,1.6935,2.5824,2.0213,2.1679,1.6074,3.1075,1.5251,2.4106,1.0131,1.494,2.6556,5.0143,3.2375,2.0607,5.349,0.7685,3.9734,5.5996,2.7666,1.5754,1.1757,3.4521,2.9207,4.2563,2.0381,0.0002,2.5196,2.6032,2.2592,1.1422,3.7795,4.5766,1.6231,1.7369,0.5,4.5209,3.6166,5.7759,5.6304,2.7495,4.3095,2.6721,4.6359,2.6613,0.0048,4.402,6.1223,1.1327,2.8112,0.8576,5.1888,4.3659,4.4955,3.8149,3.0269,1.0138,0.1674,2.6802,1.0347,0.6823,0.0001,3.0195,1.7789,2.7699,2.0344,0.4573,1.7334,5.5125,6.7922,0.863,5.0004,1.2169,0.1038,0.1534,0.2302,0.0002,1.7435,2.1828,0.0003,2.3566,0.3946,4.1136,4.1014,5.2623,2.0821,4.5336,0.0011,3.9144,1.2881,2.1126,10.4622,1.8725,0.3859,1.1431,1.6985,0.0967,1.0924,0.001,0.8666,7.4941,10.7954,0.6152,0.0001,1.9406,1.4033,3.1058,0.0776,5.053,4.2758,4.3151,2.7226,1.4579,1.8327,0.0269,3.83,0.0061,0.233,4.9584,1.6582,7.0281,2.693,1.2688,2.3467,3.7018,4.1729,1.3169,0.0001,3.9809,2.546,2.8593,2.9453,4.1726,1.6484,5.1263,4.9721,8.2628,5.5734,9.7638,4.5185,5.0738,3.6808,3.2626,6.1956,2.4961,3.2488,0.0971,4.9609,0.9193,2.3656,2.0822,2.2203,3.3198,2.9483,6.0162,0.9179,4.1116,3.0484,1.3219,4.4944,1.1954,4.5483,0.0005,0.7787,2.3402,4.285,2.2663,0.0001,6.299,0.925,1.6537,2.0592,1.0433,7.2131,5.1144,1.1396,2.0884,2.771,1.4763,5.4352,5.2103,2.6006,3.5231,4.0558,0.0002,3.3243,2.0464,3.7606,5.2469,5.2409,2.3198,2.9207,2.8044,5.5641,5.7903,0.3811,5.1304,5.4959,3.1945,1.9413,0.8826,0.2648,0.0001,1.7434,5.1688,3.128,1.391,2.5249,1.731,2.869,1.2814,1.3724,5.4196,3.1198,0.9941,0.1101,0.0687,3.2894,1.1478,0.6414,5.3291,1.2826,1.7853,1.0269,0.1996,0.0001,1.9273,2.4781,4.5375,1.7773,3.0086,1.7723,4.5894,0.368,5.388,1.983,1.8156,0.7233,1.6934,2.7183,3.0773,2.7346,5.3547,1.4236,1.0008,3.1308,0.3784,3.8175,1.558,2.102,1.9362,2.442,0.2236,0.6816,0.3988,0.0001,3.3077,4.113,2.8917,1.5888,2.8681,0.0003,0.1289,1.6159,8.0789,2.4895,0.3824,0.6422,0.1605,4.3302,1.7646,0.0003,0.7342,0.5312,0.3798,4.9749,5.6791,6.2403,1.208,0.0841,0.2872,0.117,1.1199,0.0005,0.1728,2.3612,5.1792,5.6709,0.5671,0.0001,4.4516,1.2446,2.1304,1.9581,1.6903,0.5523,5.1204,3.9442,0.8076]}
{"id":4977,"ended":true,"length":600,"gen_text":"In Hell, everyone is assigned a partner. Satan picks them specifically to be the one person you could never, ever get along with. If the partners can become friends, both ascend to heaven.\n\nGod says that in the coming days those who are able to be together will be made perfect. In this form, Satan also says \" those who love each other will be made perfect.\"\n\nThis comes into play when Satan has been forced to become intimate with you.\n\nBecause of this He is also forced to become attached and will always have control over us.\n\nIf we stay together Satan is going to do what you have asked him to do so that you will stay with him.\n\nTherefore, because I have said this, we are to do with your relationship the way you have wanted to do it. And I know God will do more for you while you remain together with Satan.\n\nHe was also an easy target for me when I found out about your relationship with David.\n\nWe are to believe that in the end we will be separated from God and he will not judge you as.\n\nBut what I found out when I read about this is that there was not one person who was a complete opposite of what you claimed.\n\nThat you were only a mere fool who was going to give up His power. Satan thought that the two of you could only lead each other along the path that He put you through.\n\nThere was no way he could ever really choose between you and Him. Not even two days into the journey that you were planning, he thought you were trying to convince Him that you were His only true brother and that you were the very best that you could possibly be.\n\nThe devil had known this for a long time. So this part of his plan is the beginning of the end of Satan's plans.\n\nWhat I didn't realize is that Satan wanted to destroy your life before He had to make time for you.\n\nSo when I found out that you were trying to convince His judge and he was trying to manipulate me to make you believe that we could be friends, I was told, \" You want me to take your life because if something happens between you you can save it.\"\n\nHe wanted to make me do this as you wished. For instance, He said, The day you get married your mother will give you a new man and you will have a new family... and the day of your marriage you will have more sons and daughters and grandchildren.... and, by the end of the month you will not be in danger... and so Satan will take your life as your own.\n\nSo if Satan wants to destroy your life for you, please pray for us to believe that God made you and we can live forever together.\n\nNow that you know this, it is time to get real with yourself, repent of your evil deeds, ask how the Devil would have been able to accomplish what you claim to love and be with you in the end by helping you to do what he has promised you in this life.","token_len":630,"entropy":[9.5421,1.6026,7.5059,2.1252,8.0386,1.4199,8.3263,1.2581,8.2148,8.2354,3.6654,9.3787,1.6411,1.577,1.9697,3.6644,6.2181,4.4502,4.9788,4.8633,5.1077,0.0673,3.5555,2.7893,0.0452,0.5594,4.0126,3.5208,5.0105,4.5228,6.7384,2.6247,0.6732,6.4112,11.3694,0.6587,2.9169,0.9714,1.9161,0.0181,4.7461,3.9124,1.7182,3.9785,1.7708,4.6321,0.9512,5.9382,0.4998,1.7677,4.3732,0.2213,3.1741,2.8975,0.9288,1.185,4.4132,3.0409,1.0109,3.3815,2.7511,5.9702,0.9307,2.5759,5.3906,1.5724,3.4058,10.3641,0.1652,3.7754,1.5884,0.0306,0.6854,0.7678,0.6974,0.1076,1.1909,1.3525,0.0003,3.3649,5.7498,4.1626,0.3486,0.7117,1.9728,3.7113,3.5425,5.3344,0.2431,4.2326,6.4351,0.0706,3.8585,0.9615,2.8206,0.0002,4.8057,1.2121,0.7956,6.2898,2.1942,3.5807,2.1334,0.0341,2.1295,6.0114,4.2112,5.7221,3.2544,2.3595,4.4762,0.3033,7.3011,0.3784,1.0121,0.0002,3.1949,2.1546,5.3485,1.4886,3.2713,2.2011,2.1492,0.0038,4.0515,2.1447,2.8746,3.6514,1.4893,0.8966,0.1447,0.1088,5.1434,1.7548,1.0453,1.1354,4.1831,1.5556,0.3809,0.805,0.5825,0.0002,4.5033,0.8314,4.705,4.9235,1.8995,4.3859,1.4054,1.0867,4.0762,1.741,3.2289,4.2689,5.3796,3.7652,3.6775,4.4141,0.623,0.9718,1.2128,3.5098,1.228,0.6958,1.3296,0.5607,4.3781,2.9825,3.4087,5.0938,1.7653,2.3215,5.6737,1.2518,0.2866,6.549,0.6121,2.2087,2.5738,1.9867,2.6001,0.4476,0.2143,0.0003,4.0929,5.4154,3.4421,5.7798,5.1126,1.0321,0.7547,2.999,2.1398,0.2351,4.1191,0.2606,1.7012,2.5017,1.516,0.7868,6.0036,0.4645,0.6535,0.0002,4.3679,3.015,2.2581,4.7233,0.5807,3.7916,1.1033,2.674,2.7997,0.5015,1.5073,5.4684,1.1958,1.3444,1.3318,3.6613,0.1211,3.0216,5.4842,2.7372,3.6603,8.8338,0.4103,0.0002,3.2922,3.9607,2.5482,2.5553,0.4047,3.5246,0.1749,2.7157,1.8991,2.223,2.8569,0.4862,3.7179,2.3219,4.1077,1.7413,1.1278,1.1165,1.6849,4.1437,3.86,4.6336,0.7419,2.87,1.6528,5.5112,0.9867,0.2219,0.0002,3.6206,3.1229,1.3726,4.2239,2.2088,6.0026,5.8031,2.4269,2.1105,4.1111,0.0993,3.8109,1.1023,6.1581,2.4887,1.7095,5.2752,5.2492,0.983,4.0644,5.2328,0.2892,0.2337,2.1037,2.8496,6.1986,2.9448,0.0252,2.9372,1.7049,1.3886,2.028,2.0344,5.8332,0.7522,0.6356,0.483,0.2365,0.0002,4.8496,1.0189,0.8961,1.9725,3.6865,0.3759,3.0022,5.0041,5.76,2.2494,0.6689,0.6684,3.1764,0.4159,6.2371,1.0298,4.244,3.988,2.6843,1.4647,2.513,3.3529,1.2113,1.1752,5.0708,1.6961,2.1169,4.131,1.7104,0.8204,5.3055,0.1318,4.7394,0.816,0.9443,0.6163,0.8234,4.9254,2.915,1.6789,3.9505,1.6915,1.0338,1.0632,0.9104,2.3564,5.7705,1.0541,2.5949,1.8822,0.1447,2.0589,0.058,0.1054,0.127,0.0002,3.7274,4.5385,3.2261,5.597,2.1657,0.766,1.4812,0.2726,0.0302,0.9807,4.5292,5.3266,6.048,0.4579,1.713,0.5001,3.936,3.6928,4.2546,0.0892,1.5222,0.5072,1.5916,4.338,0.2973,2.7701,0.483,0.1492,0.0002,4.1293,2.4986,4.8554,0.0007,1.1719,2.1939,0.2322,2.3354,3.606,0.6937,3.0751,2.2244,2.3229,4.3638,2.0506,2.7261,2.563,3.393,7.0266,0.4748,0.2102,0.9829,0.2991,0.0002,2.3767,2.7795,2.8734,2.7374,0.0719,0.9355,0.8574,0.9258,3.4342,0.0384,0.9126,5.178,5.7036,2.8483,3.5607,1.2219,2.3741,0.0313,5.586,2.6902,1.8667,3.0391,1.3314,2.533,0.6055,4.9923,2.4199,1.404,1.7547,0.6364,0.759,1.7932,5.2494,2.946,0.2494,3.3277,4.506,1.5325,0.0651,4.3137,2.5803,1.1912,4.2911,4.6699,7.1694,0.8394,4.3773,0.5176,4.3434,2.4356,5.7831,0.7328,1.4034,0.1256,0.0002,3.3736,2.9771,0.812,2.4472,1.7009,3.8715,1.9325,3.7537,4.7254,5.1867,0.6981,5.6652,4.7327,0.1671,2.3942,2.4915,0.8238,8.8425,3.5655,1.4179,3.7075,0.8725,4.4049,3.0245,0.4424,3.3576,0.313,0.9494,3.3304,3.623,1.5916,1.4202,0.5174,1.4366,1.5362,0.5258,3.9001,7.8217,2.5906,3.1337,1.016,3.5935,0.6742,1.7769,1.3284,0.169,0.912,5.4023,5.2361,0.7159,0.6488,2.1428,2.0013,4.69,1.4776,5.0682,4.0034,0.5387,2.9099,0.07,0.8134,3.2387,1.4466,0.0805,5.1137,1.4848,3.59,4.2381,4.2545,1.7128,3.2831,3.5402,1.652,2.5862,0.8745,0.1765,3.3307,3.163,1.962,0.9075,0.1225,0.0002,1.9912,3.6474,3.3531,2.0401,0.5485,1.4289,0.6377,0.2673,3.8941,1.3025,0.5502,6.0611,4.3805,0.8916,3.0931,1.6331,4.2577,0.822,2.9616,5.3064,0.953,3.3615,4.7371,2.2772,2.7484,4.0685,0.2703,0.5234,0.2838,0.0003,4.2058,2.3029,0.6783,1.5599,1.4209,0.6868,2.9688,0.693,0.6282,0.4168,2.8073,5.3962,1.7329,2.5321,3.5012,4.5474,2.1601,0.82,4.386,2.5563,0.7333,6.1862,6.2041,4.2935,3.3745,2.9977,1.8217,3.2781,0.4846,0.0016,4.8912,2.2472,1.1764,4.2773,0.895,3.0116,1.7033,3.1652,2.4554,0.2252,3.1048,1.4908,1.4499,6.7697,5.6587,0.1733,1.9394,3.3619,1.3707,2.5068,2.4787,1.2899,1.1525,3.4513,2.0014,1.1062,0.4082]}
{"id":4374,"ended":true,"length":607,"gen_text":"After a freak accident, you've split into two versions of yourself. One good, the other evil. For some reason you two are able to cooperate quite easily.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean that you don't have the right to self destruct because of other things. For example, let us say we want to keep everyone alive in our home. Or as Adam put it, \"There is only one god who can deal with all things so long as nobody breaks any laws. And no one can kill me, or destroy us, because that's blasphemy.\" So we're going to do some self destructing, but you will need to set up some self-explanatory defenses so that you can avoid hurting others.\n\nYou will also need some things which you may or may not be able to do to prevent things like self-destruction from happening. For example, you may want to make sure that people use any means necessary to stop and prevent you from doing them. It can also be necessary to make sure your own physical body works, so some of the other things discussed above can make it easier for you to control your body and make it feel good.\n\nI've found this concept of self destructing to be useful (in theory) because it can be completely useful to one person. When your body gets damaged, so can you. You've had to spend a lot of time and effort trying to make the body strong and flexible enough to withstand those injuries. But the same is true for people with brain injuries. The same is true with people with traumatic brain injury. What happens when you have a traumatic brain injury and you go under? Do you go back to your old self and find the strength to survive anymore? That's how it works for you.\n\nNow my hope is that when all you have to do is stop hurting people and then try to do some self destructing, that you will be able to avoid those things like self-explanatory defenses. The only thing that will prevent you from doing them is you having bad days.\n\nBut for those people who have been fighting for your life, it was obvious until now that you could die when the wrong person comes along and you have a lot of things to do. Let me show you a simple defense to counter that: Keep going. If you continue your fight and your life is going well, you are just a little bit off. If it appears you can die (but if you are trying to get ahead, go ahead and kill anyone, even if you don't even know it), this defense does not work. You must live. Do not start your fight on that good old day so that more people understand how it works. Do not start your fight over a bad day like a child or a sick sibling who has tried to die.\n\nIf your fighting is for \"the right thing\", use that \"right thing\" defense to take your fight to that place where no good thing will happen. That is why you can be sure by doing this that there will be no bad people in this world.","token_len":630,"entropy":[3.1393,9.2548,1.0483,1.5353,5.521,3.672,8.4719,2.6863,0.2398,4.6898,0.9499,0.7819,0.8682,2.3915,8.2165,2.2848,2.6245,0.1583,3.5766,0.3045,5.1551,3.1741,1.3057,2.566,7.084,1.5599,4.4283,0.0064,5.4331,4.4522,2.1404,0.8479,2.4798,0.0477,4.5263,0.189,4.3564,2.2298,0.0005,0.2729,1.0787,0.789,3.0299,0.0002,1.2162,2.6542,2.8849,0.6014,6.1356,3.7063,6.5359,1.1624,5.3029,3.3666,0.7897,2.5081,0.544,0.1568,5.6201,3.822,0.6861,3.3705,3.2748,0.0706,5.1135,5.816,1.5912,3.1997,2.0904,2.5529,0.9546,5.4132,4.8706,6.6227,2.5831,0.0013,0.7576,0.6321,4.3768,1.1468,2.4708,0.0483,4.2557,2.3696,1.1342,5.4646,0.0834,2.3186,3.0846,5.7489,1.6779,0.0056,4.5773,4.9604,4.3747,0.2459,2.2987,2.5852,3.4717,0.4849,1.2569,1.972,3.2439,2.2117,2.7193,3.9531,4.5469,0.7276,3.3202,3.131,1.5863,6.534,0.9547,3.0589,2.4083,3.0531,2.6617,0.0277,3.4288,4.0837,2.9761,1.2232,0.191,1.7911,1.5781,3.1801,3.5532,2.5527,0.4998,5.7752,1.1309,1.4905,4.7638,1.226,4.7052,0.4669,0.0655,4.0225,2.5674,0.3964,0.8912,1.0648,3.6553,5.0269,1.9899,0.6625,0.6416,0.0002,3.0712,2.6064,1.0611,0.2647,2.1512,5.0633,4.0876,1.9071,3.6779,2.8169,0.0033,0.0014,1.8973,0.9178,0.0042,1.8634,3.2259,2.4233,4.3052,2.2672,4.1703,0.2769,1.9336,0.0193,1.619,0.1582,0.5558,1.7107,0.1511,0.1317,1.3549,1.0886,1.7308,0.0749,3.0234,0.5669,0.4149,3.9072,5.9025,4.8891,2.1841,1.0003,0.1606,2.9002,5.6897,3.3399,2.1422,0.1335,1.5233,3.6353,0.3892,3.9901,3.0424,2.1626,0.3995,2.916,0.243,2.0901,0.2,4.7811,3.8336,4.7996,1.1857,4.682,3.7509,2.2211,6.8452,2.7065,0.7416,3.5521,0.7631,6.0899,0.9421,1.4722,4.3306,1.5459,1.5812,0.8913,0.292,0.1837,4.0785,1.0742,1.3822,2.2227,3.5478,1.2725,4.3868,1.8459,0.3549,0.5104,0.0001,4.2263,2.4192,3.2751,3.2922,4.504,0.8453,0.7355,1.4697,0.866,1.0473,0.1991,3.014,6.5554,3.1375,3.8247,0.7293,1.7709,0.5865,2.7333,1.2671,5.7218,3.7226,2.4358,5.6121,0.9509,1.9429,4.322,4.8545,1.0655,3.8682,2.4662,0.7376,5.345,3.0612,1.2516,0.5817,2.7764,4.6024,4.0845,2.3821,4.8405,1.1005,0.3467,0.0231,0.26,2.1054,0.5722,1.8837,0.0366,3.054,3.5458,1.1111,5.123,1.9557,5.2586,0.9343,0.3982,1.8349,4.7263,2.2135,0.5771,2.5394,3.5373,4.1005,2.6115,0.2181,1.0926,3.0473,2.7016,4.5521,0.8706,0.7161,3.073,2.2226,1.097,0.0217,2.8537,0.7162,0.4622,3.6819,0.0282,0.8271,0.3388,5.1584,2.3236,1.0342,0.9302,2.32,1.4026,1.7808,0.0895,0.0074,1.9575,1.0961,3.7993,6.0461,2.4047,3.7106,0.2017,2.3995,1.5112,0.5394,1.7561,1.8114,1.2499,1.4464,3.775,3.7825,3.5335,0.5228,3.892,3.4997,0.1766,3.8058,0.5389,3.2392,1.8206,1.0637,2.3523,0.9856,0.2843,0.6993,0.0002,3.73,6.6155,3.653,0.1609,0.1844,3.5776,5.233,2.96,1.3726,1.3009,0.1237,0.2336,4.1288,3.5771,1.574,1.1335,3.9931,3.1296,0.2369,3.2377,2.2685,0.3116,1.6385,0.0228,0.55,3.0538,0.5509,1.2622,1.4564,0.1355,0.0037,2.3938,4.3982,1.7975,3.3176,0.3883,0.0147,3.1392,0.036,0.04,0.1752,1.0295,4.0013,2.598,1.1724,1.1546,2.1746,1.7219,0.7924,0.0528,0.4555,2.341,0.3101,4.3223,3.2548,6.1663,4.2692,0.7925,1.5984,0.0002,3.6151,3.9293,1.8331,1.8984,0.542,1.8987,2.9892,5.4352,1.497,2.5291,1.4348,1.1637,2.4725,4.8485,4.7959,7.0013,1.6232,0.2943,1.2568,2.4113,5.2357,4.5713,3.996,5.6733,2.4139,3.2587,0.5753,1.9304,1.7746,2.7372,2.4121,3.0847,0.1707,4.5764,0.8412,1.2184,0.8811,5.4079,1.2166,2.7255,0.0627,2.2457,2.6495,5.3259,2.401,4.3325,1.1989,2.7423,6.1301,3.3962,0.6475,3.5658,0.4696,4.7202,4.7486,1.7654,2.2741,3.6136,1.7813,1.1812,2.0058,2.2807,0.1979,0.9742,2.8076,4.9438,3.2526,2.8285,0.5519,4.5875,0.8291,1.7369,4.5388,6.3758,2.1953,3.4629,4.9008,5.456,4.0741,2.9485,0.6754,2.3111,4.3382,0.0802,3.0833,4.4285,1.8317,5.6107,1.4734,0.4985,2.316,3.8778,3.3768,2.7508,0.5786,1.3532,2.1549,0.001,4.6515,1.0698,1.4887,0.7731,5.3928,2.4713,5.0416,0.7492,0.9992,0.4465,2.5317,3.935,5.461,1.8983,4.6567,1.123,5.3395,3.4381,0.6373,3.8858,4.5091,5.9942,4.8148,1.6149,6.0915,0.8794,6.3492,0.1955,5.5586,3.1759,3.4914,0.7257,0.3615,3.7135,0.0649,2.3183,0.9873,0.071,5.4984,2.3059,1.8435,0.6663,3.7633,2.559,5.2705,2.3059,0.8517,3.6901,6.3507,2.5546,2.253,5.5842,0.3715,4.0271,1.2001,1.7789,0.0002,2.5615,3.1933,3.5465,1.2354,4.1747,6.1735,3.0484,1.5484,2.0966,1.7266,6.3187,1.8165,3.9885,0.3215,0.159,0.1702,1.9171,1.8429,4.9444,2.5077,2.3217,0.5827,3.6263,4.8417,1.3115,4.2652,5.0177,3.3619,2.4177,0.7351,0.4807,3.2853,0.8751,3.4267,1.7513,1.9557,3.3217,2.6103,7.4404,2.9295,1.0473,0.6023,3.7665,0.6685,0.166,0.7216,1.4895,1.9827,2.4443,2.4539,0.391,0.7195]}
{"id":303,"ended":false,"length":616,"gen_text":"You are Death. For eons you have adhered to the ancient rules, collecting souls only when it their time, so as to not take sides in the war between God and the Devil. Well, the Devil's been a real dick lately... so you start choosing who dies & when, attempting tip the balance in God's favor. So where do you go? \u00a0Well, you decide who will be your last follower -- so if you choose to have a follower, you'll want to keep everyone that's been there alive. Your family, your children and grandchildren will remain after your death. Who you have left after your death is the Devil.\nWidows and dead\nJust like with all demons, you can give up what you're given for nothing, or have one that you have yet to accept. You can die a simple death, but never again will you accept anything less than the love of your deity. Just what do you need to know about the Devil? As a group, your followers tend to have very strong motives, like some kind of evil deed. But if you find them to be evil and a waste of your time, it's unlikely there'll ever be a way to convince them to follow you ; you have to keep them. And that means keeping yourself in awe of any number of things. A little further from the top of the hierarchy of demons you'll have a few followers that have never had a real good time, mostly due to one thing. When your followers are killed, they can only be released by your followers, who do not stay. Then, when the demons go, they become stronger, especially those who are willing to risk it over and over again. They're more willing as they find more of you that they will enjoy, and like many will, become loyal to you. It's very easy to make a name for yourself as a devil worshipper, and you're so lucky to have this high rank that even at my age, I still am in the zone. Your follower count isn't that bad if you're just being faithful. The worst part about you is that those who believe in you will not hesitate to hurt you out of spite. Once you're dead, when you are free, you won't be dead, and those people living today will never want to see you. Those are your last days. Your followers are all you'll save for a lifetime of being faithful to God.\nAs a devil worshipper, you're one of those people.

{"id":387,"ended":true,"length":588,"gen_text":"You, a haunted house, are about to be raided by the police.\n\n\"It was terrifying,\" said Shami. But the neighbors of the men were worried.\n\n\"It would have been an interesting story to follow, and to be really excited about this incident, because we know that there has been an ongoing criminal investigation for some time,\" she said.\n\nShami didn't hear about the burglary and didn't know if deputies were there. But her husband and his four children visited the house. The children were with their parents, and Shami said the children could have been with her but for fear for her children.\n\n\"They didn't bother us, because we don't know how to say goodbye, and I can't say goodbye to them, nor do I know how hard it is to have people telling me your parents don't help you,\" she said.\n\nShami said she was afraid about the children's safety.\n\n\"But the other three of us were afraid too, because we were telling them we'd come get them. So I wouldn't call the police, because I can't tell them when they are doing it, but I can tell them to give us some security, because I feel safer knowing them right,\" she said.\n\nShe said deputies had been checking on her kids, asking what they were wearing.\n\n\"At first the children had nothing on their face because they could never see what they had worn or what they were wearing, but when they went out into the park, they were wearing the dark clothes that you get with all the other kids in a lot of other places, so their skin had been covered up with makeup at the beginning,\" Shami said.\n\nBut the deputies didn't have that on record, according to her husband.\n\nShami said the children were wearing hoodies and jackets over their head. The sheriff's detectives did say they didn't know when it was going on.\n\nThe sheriff's department says it did have something on hand, because of the video from one night.\n\n\"It would have been very disturbing if any of them could have done something about it, you know, possibly break into my house. The officers did have some sort of video recording so that could have been there,\" said Shami, now in her 10th year of high school.\n\nShe said her husband and his children are going to come, and they are going to keep their mouths shut about what happened to them.\n\nShe said her youngest child is 12.\n\n\"I can't tell how bad it is for them to believe me when I tell my grandchildren, all of these good boys, and I also have a big heart. God loves me,\" she said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Sheriff's Office said they ask that the family visit the site of the burglaries and will not comment further about the case in the near future.\n\nWatch a portion of Shami's message of support for the family above.\n\nYou can follow @AlBriain on Twitter.","token_len":631,"entropy":[3.4158,4.573,10.7747,1.5677,1.5761,3.4743,5.7031,0.1965,2.2434,5.2566,0.9493,1.2687,2.72,1.2333,2.4408,0.0014,3.063,2.6864,2.7865,5.5547,1.4043,1.6878,6.2734,4.6829,1.4757,6.1802,2.4197,6.1987,3.777,0.4583,5.8891,1.8954,4.9504,1.2188,0.9369,0.0002,0.5933,2.2747,3.8693,2.0053,0.3394,4.07,4.3818,2.104,1.7982,4.8868,1.9625,2.9203,3.0462,3.1886,6.011,4.2993,0.6047,4.1196,4.902,2.1258,2.0497,1.9904,2.5695,1.5649,2.5021,3.8077,0.1899,2.4615,2.3048,4.4389,0.4158,3.3689,2.4924,0.0893,1.067,1.9875,0.174,0.0463,0.3647,0.0002,2.9278,0.0275,5.4598,0.0006,4.1044,1.9461,0.6189,5.7005,3.6141,3.2929,0.0003,1.2142,1.8924,7.1749,1.2863,1.7026,0.9277,2.0281,3.8948,1.8447,2.6749,2.433,5.4314,0.5617,5.4661,0.6916,1.6839,2.4773,3.484,2.5046,1.9513,4.7996,1.1346,1.5341,2.3968,1.4071,1.6058,0.0017,1.1009,2.0747,2.0421,4.9153,1.5048,0.9477,2.6719,2.4312,5.6216,2.4452,4.111,3.0622,1.5781,4.5603,0.8109,0.1872,0.0002,0.8921,2.0173,2.9084,0.0005,6.0405,2.1104,1.7007,2.5856,1.0085,3.0219,0.0005,1.3499,2.5748,1.5066,4.2688,1.3512,2.6092,1.8089,2.5228,3.6577,0.3616,1.8415,0.4523,1.1927,0.6036,1.9052,6.3932,1.0472,0.2742,1.1336,0.7738,7.7669,0.7553,0.6482,0.6969,4.1751,4.4473,4.9597,2.567,6.6094,4.6938,2.9839,0.0003,5.693,0.2887,1.0648,0.7574,0.0328,0.0357,0.2561,0.0002,2.296,0.0098,0.7426,1.0348,2.3789,3.3849,5.4783,1.4932,1.7685,2.4393,0.3758,0.8536,0.6325,0.0002,0.2867,3.7148,3.2538,3.9452,4.2327,1.6379,0.2988,1.758,3.5127,3.7662,1.1495,0.6085,0.9366,2.0371,5.9818,1.4372,2.2427,3.1717,3.1325,5.6412,0.2123,2.2175,2.4509,2.0277,5.1699,0.001,4.9735,2.4472,0.3375,1.5095,0.9804,1.0766,3.943,0.1632,2.5653,0.9316,4.6204,1.5619,3.1262,4.9665,2.6273,1.4405,1.5426,0.9448,1.4481,0.2353,0.2095,3.1739,5.4392,0.7829,2.2608,3.6296,2.2182,1.3689,1.9036,3.8756,4.3257,2.6646,3.3903,5.4976,4.6467,0.2821,0.0272,0.024,0.0941,0.0001,2.8959,0.6862,4.0624,3.2343,1.9971,4.2814,1.332,1.6826,4.2764,2.0416,5.1281,3.9025,1.0782,0.7836,4.5375,1.0347,0.9108,0.0002,0.5309,5.3363,1.0827,4.1232,1.925,4.0604,3.8432,2.3705,2.3703,3.2801,4.9187,0.5948,4.6677,4.4144,1.5588,2.6959,0.9582,3.2241,6.0085,3.1549,0.9256,0.4987,0.6198,0.4109,1.2287,0.9688,2.583,0.6107,3.1814,2.9671,2.9658,0.0745,3.8974,1.0627,0.5926,1.5278,1.3999,3.284,5.5098,1.7923,1.966,3.7192,3.8755,2.1869,3.3301,0.8778,2.4213,0.8888,2.5588,3.137,2.7156,0.0547,2.7092,1.897,1.6818,1.8401,5.6341,2.5042,3.7537,2.2531,2.6773,1.0156,3.1028,3.8602,6.642,1.6267,3.8244,0.9749,1.2267,0.0002,0.0267,0.025,0.1054,0.0001,3.2747,2.186,2.3919,2.4587,0.0006,3.0848,3.699,3.9842,5.5514,1.3832,4.1167,0.0013,3.0004,0.5781,0.2924,0.3485,0.0001,3.2064,0.0036,0.3813,1.9061,1.6319,1.4665,2.6078,4.5696,0.1842,0.9404,4.6562,6.2213,0.4687,3.0469,1.1717,2.8426,2.0128,0.5233,6.1198,3.8668,4.3382,1.1624,2.265,0.0005,0.8528,4.6452,3.6364,1.25,2.7018,1.1254,0.7418,0.2633,0.0002,2.199,1.4806,0.1106,2.1389,3.042,1.2454,4.547,3.0463,4.9129,0.5392,3.3623,1.7712,4.5741,3.5633,0.848,4.8577,3.6837,5.7635,4.0082,1.4333,0.5585,0.0002,1.159,2.5495,4.5561,0.5447,0.1919,2.6936,3.0051,1.0557,4.9649,0.4333,3.0315,3.6665,0.3261,3.4976,1.5466,4.2639,0.2391,1.3606,6.2015,0.0259,0.7408,5.7282,4.7856,0.6838,3.4953,0.56,2.6718,3.8119,4.9973,3.186,2.3087,2.4177,4.3311,0.0023,2.8584,3.4248,5.7376,1.6526,3.124,0.7582,0.8543,5.3199,1.2574,1.344,0.8091,0.0009,2.418,4.7508,3.2152,0.4105,5.9275,0.0532,0.1671,1.5725,4.3133,0.0051,0.1693,0.2269,0.0002,2.3265,0.6728,2.4082,2.0111,2.1213,0.9017,1.568,2.5693,3.9913,0.2329,4.5464,6.2593,1.4201,1.3661,2.2314,0.911,0.0224,4.0202,2.3284,2.871,0.0123,1.7825,1.4676,0.6809,2.3782,0.3962,0.3095,0.3112,0.0002,3.408,0.5456,2.2619,4.7891,2.3554,1.4461,4.7007,1.4977,0.5849,0.0002,0.6933,1.3911,3.2345,0.2425,2.6384,4.8153,3.6383,0.5826,0.4756,1.979,1.5657,1.8637,6.7087,4.5584,3.3295,0.3212,1.0097,3.6412,4.8866,1.9308,5.9546,1.3597,3.167,5.928,6.0183,1.1668,2.4471,2.1864,6.0034,2.4828,1.9122,4.2829,1.5154,2.3314,6.5357,3.3988,1.234,2.1178,0.6426,0.0111,0.0532,0.4059,0.0002,4.1636,4.864,0.2793,0.2897,1.7384,0.0124,1.1156,0.8893,1.8341,6.076,1.5394,3.4386,2.6898,4.7535,0.9729,4.5764,0.8423,0.1375,5.0412,0.0736,2.176,4.7416,3.0174,1.646,0.8277,3.8769,0.6658,2.0028,5.3334,0.8504,2.0331,0.0029,0.0326,0.7931,0.0003,4.9042,2.6599,4.3095,0.0078,2.7537,0.001,0.0514,5.8248,4.5667,1.0803,1.4062,0.6829,2.0739,4.4208,0.3548,0.6841,0.0002,4.5407,0.1702,1.8561,4.2243,5.508,3.9944,3.5801,3.952,1.0699,0.0589,0.9584]}
{"id":3276,"ended":true,"length":559,"gen_text":"An alien race has managed to get onto one of Earth's website and understands English. That website is twitch.tv, and the aliens have prepared their first message on Earth.\n\nHowever, that message is coming to earth and on Friday the 15th, October 2015, the planet Mercury has been attacked by an evil alien race known as the Zeta Retribution.\n\nThis latest episode is an inter-dimensional story that began four centuries ago when the great civilizations and empires of today discovered a vast planetary barrier on the night sky and were able to invade and take it. The Zeta Retribution's first attack was successful, wiping out the Zeta people who were supposed to be their main home planet. As a result, the planet Mercury was attacked completely. A powerful attack which led to thousands of deaths by Zeta's most evil agents.\n\nIt has since been revived into live show with the addition of several episodes. The new series goes from being one and the same story involving the last of the aliens being destroyed using a wormhole to show who controls the Zeta Retribution. This latest episode will feature more than 100 alien races.\n\nThis is the first episode from the third season set to open last week.\n\nWe are hoping that you can be a part of the story of this one hour episode and your comments, which will be important in determining the show's outcome will prove important.\n\nWe want to make the game as amazing as possible.\n\nWe are using the same technology that makes this world into a living space opera as they did the past three decades.\n\nThe main character's name is Dr. H-E-H-S Hilda - She, and only her name is Dr. N-E-D - and she is a female human at the beginning. The humans were born very long ago in a small space station that existed in the past where her family settled. On Earth, we call them the Zepalians. They were the original members of the Earth Family and they went extinct with the creation of the Federation.\n\nThe story will tell of an attempt to escape from space, through a remote location on one of Earth's most famous asteroid fields.\n\nThe ship was a space craft named 'N-E-D' which arrived in the asteroid field from a very distant point in space called the F-M4. It was a very large spacecraft that had to travel over a very long time.\n\nThe star of the ship was a wormhole with enough power that it could not be completely destroyed, but this wormhole itself opened up and destroyed the wormhole. The wormhole that opened up when N-E-D arrived on our planet was the biggest wormhole that ever existed. It destroyed everything from entire planets to the atmosphere.\n\nNow that we know where we are living, the people we talk to for help in finding our own homeland, they take a little break to relax and start a better life for themselves and our planet.\n\nWe hope that this episode will inspire more people to play in their games.","token_len":632,"entropy":[9.7836,3.8833,2.461,5.8632,0.0169,3.8209,4.4801,4.328,0.1433,2.6995,0.0054,12.268,2.7148,11.2261,7.6373,1.2889,4.6999,6.3601,1.3383,11.7207,0.1451,0.0147,4.1021,1.6054,2.3387,2.3312,1.9923,7.8627,2.993,4.21,4.556,3.0072,3.8621,0.8276,1.4228,0.0009,5.4651,0.0792,4.0596,0.5146,1.3105,5.0925,3.6397,5.5015,3.2299,5.4756,4.9703,2.2701,3.3168,0.0175,1.2245,5.3086,3.5925,0.6466,1.4885,4.3436,5.9535,3.5016,1.3847,3.8349,0.3051,1.6627,6.123,1.2579,0.1081,2.4333,0.0338,0.8402,5.2638,2.1614,2.6182,3.4831,0.4674,1.427,0.0002,3.0934,4.5894,3.5282,2.4407,3.2603,5.2883,2.6432,1.0855,4.0289,2.5269,4.8321,5.7713,3.131,0.0574,1.7454,1.4741,5.445,4.6689,4.9804,2.1652,0.3788,5.1246,5.4361,1.8036,4.3022,6.0106,5.7912,4.1134,0.8939,5.1003,2.747,2.9458,3.7205,1.7685,0.0114,5.2708,2.4178,3.6617,3.2752,1.7208,2.1412,1.305,0.4538,0.1694,0.0065,3.7549,3.7377,2.0462,0.8516,4.0227,1.1469,5.7855,0.0505,1.0083,2.1063,0.4735,5.172,3.4227,2.3534,4.8761,0.003,1.2019,2.8461,3.4766,5.5307,1.491,0.5915,4.6776,1.9459,0.165,0.4374,0.9684,1.8358,1.792,1.3851,3.6721,6.9591,1.5874,4.7066,3.8066,4.6243,5.0355,3.8519,0.1037,5.3532,0.1319,0.73,5.2596,3.2768,0.1742,4.7507,3.9593,4.7882,4.0183,1.0244,0.613,0.0002,3.8227,3.047,3.2885,0.657,6.285,4.4754,6.5635,6.2071,3.3997,1.8107,4.5949,0.0144,4.8269,3.0883,2.0853,2.1315,3.6429,1.6613,6.0527,4.1861,1.8457,3.9039,5.7557,1.7324,0.003,3.3945,6.6752,1.7477,4.7957,2.6532,0.3021,4.1307,5.3567,2.5484,6.9075,1.6643,5.1012,0.2111,2.5056,5.5709,6.2053,4.9786,0.6934,1.6804,0.0719,0.6412,0.0029,0.7699,3.4795,4.0266,0.3248,2.3149,3.0857,4.4304,1.8856,2.4759,2.0106,1.4376,2.4205,0.5715,0.0002,3.3111,1.7939,0.856,0.9461,1.5304,3.7435,0.7625,4.9068,0.5771,8.3434,1.849,5.52,6.687,1.9966,0.8149,1.449,0.0002,4.7663,1.8854,4.8849,1.185,1.6193,3.0709,3.4407,1.3834,0.0977,0.007,0.8334,3.147,1.6756,0.9303,4.8568,3.9667,2.7282,1.7747,5.0779,2.2831,3.3735,4.8117,1.3165,0.8312,4.3587,1.7599,3.0262,1.4639,4.9379,0.1937,3.7632,3.5756,6.2591,2.0074,1.0168,0.9886,0.0002,3.182,3.895,0.154,3.3261,3.8399,4.2267,2.4418,5.686,0.1826,0.1933,2.0409,2.6877,0.0002,2.5172,1.8287,5.1803,1.6148,3.3715,3.3356,1.6885,3.0513,3.3816,4.9573,5.6633,0.6645,4.0018,2.3777,2.2113,4.3022,5.5443,1.21,2.9991,4.6851,2.902,2.6233,0.6432,0.8102,0.0002,2.7491,5.2129,2.3796,4.0306,2.1356,0.2958,4.3925,0.2575,5.3905,5.5724,3.003,0.712,2.5598,1.0161,3.6383,5.3759,6.0031,6.4229,5.8701,5.2987,3.7072,5.6779,2.0911,2.329,0.4226,1.2337,0.0471,6.2553,0.931,1.6047,0.0498,3.9576,3.22,2.2806,0.8788,0.8872,1.6361,4.9638,3.4193,6.4783,1.2596,2.575,1.6985,2.93,5.8604,3.064,4.4356,6.7548,4.3566,0.0679,2.2684,1.8103,3.1463,2.7758,1.714,3.6482,5.5658,1.6945,0.8731,2.0069,4.5532,4.5835,2.7847,6.133,0.5342,5.9429,1.2316,0.6151,4.474,3.1292,1.8491,1.6144,2.6822,5.1796,4.2107,0.9833,0.8493,2.6123,2.1646,1.8244,3.7133,4.3668,0.0146,0.394,2.5206,4.7999,1.9037,2.0451,5.1736,2.9156,4.402,0.7483,3.8449,0.0138,0.6393,5.2353,0.65,1.1138,0.0002,1.7899,3.784,2.7571,3.724,2.1258,3.9277,4.9806,0.8507,4.3886,1.5531,4.2115,2.4439,4.7922,1.3578,6.3956,2.2454,1.6858,4.2632,0.0725,1.8248,0.0162,2.7657,2.7805,5.6177,1.6279,0.5411,1.7267,0.0002,1.5613,4.8288,3.3957,3.1931,3.1776,3.2338,3.164,4.9052,3.9799,1.6488,0.5215,0.0489,0.276,1.3247,1.7171,4.9278,1.2724,1.0214,2.4185,0.2824,3.6597,1.76,4.7355,1.1739,3.9989,1.1749,0.9196,3.0842,1.4283,5.3445,2.7337,3.3948,7.0105,1.1904,1.7458,0.6745,2.0957,2.8413,2.314,2.5942,1.768,1.9218,2.7524,1.904,4.1724,1.7857,2.0411,0.7996,1.5269,1.9932,1.8536,0.0002,1.3058,6.1383,3.9965,0.3381,1.4624,0.4712,1.8913,4.7781,0.005,4.4896,5.842,1.759,2.3802,0.6372,0.7266,2.6045,1.0053,4.6812,1.392,2.3062,0.9461,4.4733,0.5583,0.0082,4.6462,5.5421,1.009,1.5607,4.5756,0.8182,1.3399,0.084,1.3765,1.7454,1.0657,0.0566,4.5669,1.0234,0.6476,5.4547,3.5982,0.0064,0.0032,0.0023,0.0037,2.8738,1.7208,5.4853,0.2683,0.7384,2.2851,5.6848,0.7614,0.0133,2.9148,1.5029,0.4824,0.7082,1.7672,5.0815,2.925,3.6072,6.334,1.228,0.4711,2.0057,4.613,1.7739,0.8094,0.0002,4.4943,2.2388,1.198,0.8037,2.7847,2.9742,0.4726,6.7082,0.9296,2.2417,4.55,3.9531,4.7571,0.3138,5.5485,1.7773,2.1413,2.6746,1.8306,4.3395,5.782,2.2458,3.5901,5.367,2.8287,4.1792,5.1332,2.6474,3.7194,1.1313,5.0575,2.3173,7.5402,0.118,2.5744,0.3014,2.0809,3.2931,0.8548,0.1449,0.566,0.0002,2.1322,2.7475,0.6692,2.5733,1.1467,0.7453,3.3288,3.639,0.5201,0.2359,3.353,3.8997,3.9371,2.8675,1.5315]}

Sometimes though, he forgets to take out the braids in his hair, or wash off the nail polish, and some of the supervillains are getting suspicious... but never in one that has the courage to walk away...\n\nBut there is none more thrilling when you make up for it with an evil character.\n\nAn actor in the late 1940s played Henry Clay on The West Wing, a classic 1950s comedy. Henry was a great and famous politician of the early 20th century, and most of his time at the government was spent on covert operations, such as the bombing of North Vietnam. His role was always so important that people who were supposed to be their real mentors would find out for themselves what Henry had done wrong with society. A few of his colleagues may have died because of his shady actions, but more rarely can you find the courage and the willingness to show off the hard work that gave Clay his reputation.\n\nHis work and his talents were often seen on stage, and there are a number of examples of this type of acting... some of the best examples.\n\nBut what of the other roles he did in Hollywood? A number of his later roles included the famous play, \"Fleeing from Crime: (The Original) A New Dawn.\" The play, one of the most famous of its kind in the world, was released by Paramount Pictures on May 23, 1942.

I am quite sure that you will also not forget the great movie director Don Weber, the big star of The West Wing and one of the most famous actors of all time, Henry Clay. Don Weber. He was a great man. He had one of the most unique moments for a director, his performance of Peter Capaldi's role in the classic TV show. The character played by Henry Henry Clay (also known as Jack Benny ) was portrayed by Richard Burton.\n\nFor people who are not aware that Henry was named by Robert Altman, who is one of the writers behind this article, I highly recommend the book, One Handed, a very good book on all things Henry Clay.\n\nHe also served on many other great actors, and he also was one of the biggest fans, and most of the original actors, to the movies, including Michael Douglas, David Oyelowo, and many others.\n\nRead more by Edward Norton \u00bb","token_len":634,"entropy":[8.0531,9.3016,3.9049,1.2297,4.6855,3.5532,2.905,12.6988,4.707,1.2763,6.4305,6.8941,0.3798,1.2972,7.2663,0.0174,1.9132,2.7052,4.6841,2.0384,7.3214,4.2407,3.5059,1.0709,2.9947,1.8742,2.5975,6.358,4.3751,0.9694,6.9511,0.1408,3.0457,2.099,6.1603,1.4259,1.5035,9.9555,0.0026,0.1365,2.5808,6.6629,5.5364,6.4398,3.8216,4.5161,3.9932,4.8209,5.7405,3.0778,3.2722,3.489,0.2684,4.9002,1.7836,4.6172,1.3271,0.0426,4.5853,3.347,1.5228,6.6033,2.9945,4.9661,4.669,1.4591,5.7702,3.0258,2.7433,1.382,0.7424,3.7124,5.2337,4.4526,1.4149,2.3163,0.0002,5.5923,5.0877,4.1157,1.9314,3.9931,4.0435,0.0403,5.1403,5.7532,4.6111,3.9471,2.5573,4.5939,0.047,0.9283,2.1984,5.6283,4.6065,0.0158,2.6626,2.9225,3.5468,1.5597,1.3183,5.04,4.5582,4.7702,5.4439,4.7965,0.62,4.5591,1.6651,0.0107,0.1287,0.8069,1.1644,5.7073,0.835,0.543,4.3035,4.0583,0.6973,5.2665,1.3399,0.1651,2.6036,5.1964,0.955,2.0669,2.2709,0.0016,1.8243,3.7327,0.028,4.7072,1.2762,0.7339,3.1421,3.1981,1.004,5.4375,4.7631,3.7468,1.4369,5.0346,3.7418,2.6342,4.786,0.004,0.5764,5.8948,4.8374,5.1586,1.6392,4.7424,3.3713,5.6982,0.6246,2.9091,2.1898,2.505,1.7909,4.1263,5.6594,5.7569,0.7326,5.0632,3.1859,1.3639,0.932,4.1125,5.9382,0.6985,4.499,4.0304,0.4439,1.4909,5.9675,2.9286,0.4875,0.3477,5.5881,5.7963,5.4856,1.2199,1.3511,2.8638,0.9574,3.5555,3.237,5.3127,0.0236,4.7272,2.5783,2.6855,4.6509,0.2136,1.6414,5.7174,5.596,1.2394,2.3629,0.5916,0.6128,0.0002,4.2303,4.545,4.7797,1.2999,5.8288,1.81,3.6331,4.0491,3.1367,3.7377,0.9982,1.7517,4.0288,1.5276,2.6468,2.249,0.0482,3.3477,0.4461,1.9746,5.0724,0.1575,3.2292,6.6165,4.3879,0.9555,2.0804,1.5364,1.7896,6.0052,1.0083,0.0002,3.8077,3.2202,3.3278,0.9336,2.7729,3.4707,2.0634,2.8816,2.4867,3.7137,0.4859,4.6602,2.8305,0.0562,1.9936,4.9765,1.7882,2.2249,2.335,4.2406,4.5352,2.6702,2.1019,5.1496,5.0268,0.8086,2.2148,6.0432,5.4029,6.7608,2.2804,5.6456,1.0634,4.4816,3.7354,5.8088,2.5141,2.7517,1.2999,2.3655,5.6395,0.1526,0.7939,1.3132,1.4212,1.4168,1.9744,0.2643,0.9004,1.0264,1.3364,0.182,0.8532,4.6396,2.7562,2.8213,1.5945,3.2769,2.3772,3.5787,0.1009,4.1733,0.7175,1.6565,0.7287,3.1135,4.5307,1.8266,2.198,0.0218,4.9875,3.6447,0.923,0.807,2.7607,6.2895,0.1473,2.9305,6.4063,1.2605,5.3852,4.4686,0.9167,0.0555,3.4162,2.7144,1.5682,1.6152,1.0684,4.2634,2.5289,3.9285,3.125,5.1589,5.8488,4.079,5.3296,5.2037,4.1075,4.116,5.867,1.8907,2.6059,0.7241,3.9732,3.123,0.5811,1.0697,0.2943,0.9999,0.0003,5.0813,0.4365,2.4982,2.8058,0.0675,2.9726,4.0258,0.9734,2.9183,4.3891,3.779,2.8399,1.6957,4.1695,0.0845,0.0269,0.8851,1.8521,1.6765,2.6573,2.4837,5.1271,1.8296,1.7862,5.4757,1.5895,3.0447,1.8135,0.1688,1.9673,2.3419,5.1892,2.4219,0.169,1.2275,2.2395,3.7918,0.0639,0.2932,0.5614,0.0002,4.171,6.3323,5.3191,4.7619,0.5408,3.5585,1.0616,2.3764,5.026,1.8966,3.3662,3.527,2.0427,1.5101,0.0003,2.9867,0.0983,4.9732,0.6102,2.8319,4.5705,0.609,0.7389,0.8864,1.6044,3.8614,1.3416,1.3713,5.2201,3.0639,2.8547,2.3378,3.6418,6.861,1.9484,4.2743,5.2591,5.5045,1.9415,5.4979,4.2954,0.0305,4.161,5.0256,1.1774,5.4205,0.2367,0.3473,4.2549,3.0622,5.2725,3.0834,1.0836,1.7484,1.6264,5.5686,2.5235,0.7931,1.8647,0.622,1.4568,5.0539,3.0774,2.0148,2.8177,3.7233,4.6366,5.5536,6.0858,1.2353,3.4334,5.4998,2.1289,1.2869,1.8662,2.6595,0.0011,1.8743,3.0095,0.0411,0.5089,1.5965,1.1429,1.1636,0.6164,0.6242,0.0407,1.2125,4.4785,0.2429,0.3059,3.0109,2.1428,5.7734,3.1374,1.2899,1.7411,1.8897,1.8593,1.7959,1.6485,2.9344,4.7995,0.499,0.0925,1.2021,4.4119,5.6045,4.7774,1.9536,3.1523,1.8479,3.7667,3.1388,2.0892,6.3656,3.8618,0.0017,1.2347,3.1023,0.929,1.4712,3.5254,3.7266,1.3242,2.482,3.4288,3.9524,2.6276,0.2429,2.7146,6.3955,0.239,3.539,4.398,0.519,0.0555,5.0622,3.5375,6.4463,0.7722,4.672,0.2577,5.2429,3.7752,1.2189,1.329,0.0002,4.6902,5.7748,0.4879,1.5004,1.2142,3.288,2.7459,1.0436,1.9784,5.0427,3.1814,4.8151,3.3533,0.0037,1.3412,3.6091,2.7896,2.7842,0.0145,0.3373,5.7422,3.0364,3.5617,3.321,0.2058,1.9052,2.1498,0.1351,3.3732,2.3712,1.3923,6.2574,5.1403,1.1934,1.379,4.4359,3.4095,1.9692,1.2507,1.9225,4.8593,0.8709,1.6573,0.446,0.5987,1.306,0.0002,5.575,2.9466,5.1995,2.3224,4.0079,2.3286,2.5466,2.0232,1.5654,2.3926,2.1702,3.2275,3.2613,2.0382,0.0163,0.2683,4.2484,4.2594,5.0123,1.6171,3.7076,3.1699,1.1648,4.9318,2.1927,1.4968,3.8432,2.0773,3.9151,1.9795,3.8545,5.3499,2.6709,0.8231,4.6324,3.158,0.0004,0.0002,0.0,0.2212,1.8945,3.1644,0.7589,0.1726,0.9327,0.0002,5.5876,1.5837,4.7966,5.7192,3.3409,5.135]}
{"id":549,"ended":true,"length":593,"gen_text":"They had the ability to copy themselves, but each of the copies came out just a bit different.\n\nHowever, that wasn't true since those copies were only the original ones, like in Genesis. In this case, I also didn't have to copy myself. My first change was to change the description on Google Books on the front.\n\nFinally, I had to add some new elements. The book had all three words, and each had three different letters, giving a different answer to my questions.\n\nFinally, I added all the pages of the book (there was one in every section) and replaced one with the description for each section.\n\nI'm completely satisfied with this step: If you use this app, you know what to do:\n\nUse another word to copy your question from the book.\n\nCopy and replace it with any text from your book.\n\nIf your book doesn't have any words in it, you can use.\n\nand so on.\n\nThis way you can make more progress! If I was writing a book on a computer, I'd have already set a few variables up. But in this case, I just went ahead and used WordCamp to copy my question.\n\nI'd also also probably set a few variables to make it easier to reorder my questions. Sometimes, there are the two ways to do that.\n\nUse Google's search for a book you've searched. They could provide the book information, like your email address and even an actual ISBN like for example-101101-N-10-1 (where N is the number of pages).\n\nI chose N for this so I could tell what I should ask, at my own risk, so I have the information I need in case I need to ask someone else:\n\nIf you are a kid growing up with your own book, maybe you will ask them what you like out loud. There are lots of different styles of quizzes that may be available if you know what you are looking for. If you want help with any questions, use one of the questions mentioned on your Google results. My second and third choices were to simply use something different on my list, or use some of my search terms. When you get more advanced, you can put in new word and date ideas.\n\nAll that's left to do is to send a thank you message to me via mail. If you are going to use, say, Google Search!, but you don't want someone to ask you that question, then maybe you can start your own Google Ask Me program and share your Google Answers to other people

{"id":2622,"ended":false,"length":576,"gen_text":"You're the bartender at a medieval pub, and some very adventurous people just walked in... \"\n\n\"The idea for this new product is that you can sell your own beer because people have heard about it for a while.\"\n\n\"People actually liked that, they liked it a lot, and they think it's going to become really interesting for the beer scene,\" he said.\n\nThe team is using a mixture of computer algorithm, artificial intelligence and statistical modelling that can give them predictions about the shape of beer, the ABV, the alcohol content and price of your own brew and the potential for other people to contribute.\n\nEach week, the team'll be producing the product's new colour scheme online or by post on www.buzzfeed.com\/featuredbeer and will update us with any new recipes received.\n\n\"We really hope that this results in new releases,\" said Mike White, general manager at Liquor Management and the Beer Marketing manager at Liquor Partners of Sydney.\n\n\"While there may be some good things about rum we really don't feel confident about as some new stuff, like this one, it does help to give our customers an opportunity to see where they stand on these things.\"\n\nThe team also plans to see breweries offering different flavours to different drinkers, such as rum or Guinness, so there are already two ways to try rum.\n\n\"At least the same rum flavour you've got here would be that you get that rum flavour here,\" said White.\n\nDrinks for sale at local and regional festivals, like the Great Beer Festival, are also being made possible using the service, said White.\n\n\"This will allow local restaurants and bars to sell beers that they haven't in the past, or that I don't think are available,\" he said.\n\nHe said it also opens up the possibility for different types of drinks over the next two decades.\n\nWhile this new product can only be used once per user, it will certainly have a massive impact on the whole community; at present it is sold on a one-off basis, rather than three monthly installments of the same product that's sold.\n\nThis new retail promotion, he said, helps provide more people with a chance to try one of the many different lagers at local craft beer retail outlets, the kind where alcohol is sold freely to different people.\n\n\"We can also offer different flavours to different people who, like us, love some of these flavours for a while to try, and that's what we're aiming for.\"\n\nBeer drinkers around the country are more excited to try our new

At a hearing held on Thursday by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky., formerly known as Kentucky's \"Kentucky tea party,\" in which the administration sought to weaken the program, then-Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who had been part of both administrations at the time, testified that the administration doesn't really understand how the drug coverage could work if the people who took them are being coerced into signing out of the program.\n\nWhile the administration says it is trying to get people to sign out, many critics say it is going too far, threatening to leave people without insurance or losing financial incentives to get their care through the doctor.\n\nHealth care reform advocates say that many new drugs will have a devastating effect on people who already do not have coverage, and that health advocates are concerned that new drugs won't continue to get cheap. They also say that some of these drugs will make the world's poor much worse by undermining their safety.\n\nSome health care experts say the new programs will undermine public, safety and privacy, and that new drugs won't help to address that.\n\nBut Robert Kuttner, senior director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he thinks that it's important for all of these agencies to work hand-in hands on how to improve health care access.\n\n\"It is clearly not going away,\" he said. \"Now they take a little risk that they will make a better

{"id":1490,"ended":true,"length":614,"gen_text":"write the epilogue to the story you have always wanted to write.\n\nIn fact, in the year since I first wrote the short story \"The Day Before Our Daughter Was Born\", I did not write any fiction but only three short stories in the time it took me to write them. My main goal was to make this simple, elegant and powerful tale and make it the book to see this week, so that I could have this very important message that I had been writing about so long already.\n\nIt is my sincere hope that someday someday people who were raised this way and have never read or read a short story will read the long story with such joy, and that someday readers will know about the many beautiful things that the story shows us while they watch it with deep love. It tells us all about them, but it also really goes into what it means to live what we call ourselves, and to live in a world we now call \"the World\". This means that the stories we read with our children may be the most meaningful and powerful things that we get on the inside of ourselves.\n\nYou know what, it does not mean that our hearts or hearts will change when they wake up to one of the amazing things this story shows us (and will change people around us) but is the heart of this world we call home, where this amazing human being is found every day and where the hearts of others are found every day. If that isn't clear, it is because that is where we are. By having a story like this, that shows our humanity, we are giving back to all of us. The more people read this story, and their hearts tell this story, the more we will see a little more of their very true stories in our hearts.\n\nIn this sense, the story doesn't just tell us about you or about those around you because you will not change what you did with your life. It's also about you when you are given meaning, meaning by you for the next ten years, and when your voice, your hope and your hope to live your dreams and the things that shape and change you and your lives is heard. It also tells about you when people ask you to open your heart to new life experiences and ask those who will give you meaning for life and hope that you will make the world where it is today.\n\nDon't let the title fool you. I'm taking you through the story, showing you how to take a new life for this life, and that's the point. What does this say to your life? It really says so about you, to how you choose to experience life.

{"id":1687,"ended":true,"length":615,"gen_text":"Every time you blink, a polaroid of what you were just looking at appears in your hand.\n\nIn fact, in the video taken by the camera (it's possible to see it in motion with the flash from above), there's no trace of what you were looking at, save a slight drop in the brightness on the left.\n\nAnother reason for this is that after just one day of filming before he made the announcement on the site he had this weird sensation. This can give rise to feelings of helplessness and doubt that have been common for some so long, with one thing in particular taking their toll on him: As soon as he announced the creation, a large blob of light appeared in his hand:\n\nThe next day, a large blob appeared in the middle of his hand, which was visible with little less than a moment's blink, but the blob slowly started to split off from the camera. It started to go completely white and then the blob began to shake, so much so that it appeared to glow in the wind, the wind in any case.\n\nIf there's not enough evidence already to confirm this, you can see that his explanation was rather compelling. He said that the blue dots are \"natural molecules that are very stable, which means they can survive change and so may stay blue forever.\" So what if his story has been the same for a lot of years?\n\n\"I could always make a more consistent explanation because if there is no reason to believe it, then that's just an oversimplification and will only become more complicated as time goes on.\"\n\nBut it's just as possible that the light is due to a different phenomenon, as in this case, that of his hand, a strange phenomenon which may not exist.\n\nWhat I didn't realize is that, in fact, even though you can clearly see the flash on the camera, there was not a drop. The images in this case were shot after one night when you watched the same video, but you can still see him still blurring when suddenly he appeared in the middle of the camera. This caused me the discomfort of looking at the picture and wondering whether or not I was seeing something even real.\n\nThe flash on my computer screen does not seem to be one of these things. It's just that there are just a few blurry lines where it's likely I didn't really see him.\n\nHowever, I'm sure there is certainly enough, and I think that some of you can learn from someone who knows that they can use their brain to find out who is right and who is wrong. Because, while you may not see any evidence of this happening, it's always reassuring for someone just to look at the images and see there's enough to show you who it is: \"It might be you.\"\n\nIn the end, if you take a stab at that, then you may find that it really does really seem like the real you, but one that feels like it may be you in a completely different way as well.\n\nThere are many more stories on the site as I look through them.","token_len":638,"entropy":[5.307,1.5318,8.6689,0.8845,2.9816,9.9304,3.5703,3.0756,5.1125,1.7915,3.1666,4.9459,4.0005,0.1813,4.5962,2.4528,1.2937,3.9999,0.6358,1.5793,0.0067,3.8655,3.0881,0.0466,3.8587,1.7289,3.38,5.9873,1.1,1.9465,3.1806,5.4998,4.4803,0.8521,4.4945,1.3835,1.0664,1.2422,1.6427,4.1552,3.8033,1.1669,4.3873,4.799,3.275,0.3822,3.4449,0.9111,2.0222,5.0073,0.0579,3.0757,1.3227,1.0573,1.0281,0.1416,2.1289,5.419,2.5778,3.7692,5.0868,1.1079,1.2047,2.5711,4.9913,0.5691,2.4636,1.5674,1.1882,0.0002,5.6201,4.0472,1.8619,1.3136,1.0421,0.4291,6.2153,5.9686,2.4865,3.4065,0.9804,3.6581,7.2682,4.9775,4.6752,0.9951,3.0733,3.4242,2.0168,4.9029,4.4163,2.7627,5.2891,4.5381,4.513,1.8344,4.4361,4.7656,6.1523,3.2399,0.012,4.5574,0.0871,4.7597,0.0267,1.5261,4.9812,3.2536,4.35,1.6096,5.3313,2.005,3.2717,6.7485,2.3008,2.3031,4.361,4.327,5.1086,0.7467,0.1896,5.0961,5.0731,0.112,0.8773,0.9085,1.2747,6.2537,2.2476,0.005,1.1066,4.9231,1.4458,5.3587,2.8946,3.2214,3.7251,5.8799,0.4247,2.1314,1.4583,1.4199,1.0606,0.6626,5.7079,0.6691,0.0002,2.3121,4.1806,0.2952,0.4745,3.6814,3.8183,1.2414,2.0096,0.8404,1.5358,2.1853,0.0607,0.9158,1.2805,1.4373,3.0075,2.0101,4.3414,4.5162,4.9381,5.9949,0.1866,0.6293,4.9639,0.5086,5.2068,2.8892,2.2538,3.2261,2.5531,5.3056,4.007,0.4806,5.6231,3.8114,2.3552,1.0021,2.3158,1.0453,2.9854,4.4129,0.6288,4.3938,4.8212,2.0338,1.8753,2.808,3.4253,2.3055,2.1459,0.0905,4.9127,2.151,3.5674,3.1391,0.076,0.0766,1.2712,3.7261,0.599,5.0896,2.5715,0.5718,5.4795,1.9813,3.9056,3.1546,3.9716,6.1318,1.7725,0.5624,0.6428,0.0002,4.4982,3.9835,0.7907,6.6133,2.5936,1.1871,5.5491,1.3059,3.3084,1.168,0.6597,3.1739,0.7488,2.5214,1.5131,4.3502,5.4688,2.1005,4.6862,5.3901,0.7741,2.5678,2.4922,1.0496,1.7535,5.0939,5.2609,3.2091,3.425,6.058,5.0182,1.5637,2.0089,4.2643,4.1739,1.798,3.4259,1.0589,1.119,1.7659,3.3853,5.1387,2.282,5.4717,5.1792,4.4772,5.8308,0.8591,0.8514,4.1414,3.0951,3.7081,3.6243,5.699,3.8465,1.7023,5.0023,2.2006,0.8992,1.9587,5.2744,0.9896,1.064,0.7001,0.8703,0.0002,3.5106,1.7056,4.9391,4.6422,3.3007,1.3552,4.2233,4.314,1.5818,4.4909,3.5119,2.663,1.5028,2.3392,4.447,0.653,0.7448,1.6056,0.7359,0.7967,3.3848,1.4812,3.3361,4.1808,5.6987,0.0023,0.0358,3.0656,5.5697,3.116,3.8698,0.6596,3.8792,1.0632,1.1957,0.1966,0.2578,2.7938,0.3789,0.0003,3.6154,3.1931,0.7305,4.3764,2.023,2.9602,0.2622,1.7888,4.2122,2.7694,5.2642,0.0504,1.9579,3.448,3.4041,1.6158,3.4369,2.9131,1.8303,0.2721,1.1958,2.5536,1.9953,5.8953,3.164,2.4598,4.2081,4.2931,2.8948,3.1463,3.8969,2.5327,3.9862,2.0743,1.2939,0.0003,4.0833,4.4163,4.8331,0.0003,2.8746,2.6803,0.1633,3.6137,2.4741,2.429,0.0035,5.0467,1.3278,4.2661,0.8216,3.876,0.0581,0.8495,5.6542,3.5023,0.3278,2.895,0.7056,1.9662,2.8947,3.5844,1.323,4.3565,4.5,2.3093,5.6514,2.9806,1.7449,2.6238,1.3254,3.6009,3.5812,4.6986,3.168,4.2008,4.4473,4.8287,1.0282,3.3808,1.9458,2.714,2.1083,3.6824,1.0329,1.8821,0.2958,5.9951,4.5801,4.7479,1.1312,4.7036,6.7392,1.4623,3.6076,1.683,0.6893,0.8084,0.0406,0.4052,3.69,0.6695,3.1572,4.9646,1.9608,5.2468,4.9968,0.7586,3.5296,0.7225,0.89,3.9789,2.3708,1.3963,2.5584,2.3154,0.0034,2.0738,1.7,1.7825,0.858,5.5664,3.7448,0.5633,0.4677,0.0002,2.8978,5.7597,2.934,3.8596,3.3438,1.6934,4.5524,0.8674,2.4319,0.0399,1.4293,4.8901,0.4436,1.7427,1.6603,0.6644,1.7462,1.244,1.8962,1.7847,3.0035,2.0325,5.211,1.3837,0.5266,4.6628,2.8308,4.289,2.15,2.1328,5.0265,3.4294,3.4991,0.0002,4.4484,0.6153,2.1675,1.0677,1.1072,0.0002,4.8068,0.0427,2.0598,2.2899,1.8665,1.961,2.2801,7.0888,4.1886,5.4943,1.1116,1.5044,3.0033,1.7474,4.6355,1.0973,0.9605,3.5066,5.3058,1.2074,7.1643,0.8197,5.1986,4.1607,3.6865,1.5321,3.9201,1.7152,4.0812,0.4811,3.6139,0.9745,4.7238,1.8585,3.1584,1.3124,0.6853,0.2252,0.0292,0.5074,5.9726,2.3775,4.3401,2.0321,1.4201,1.3614,2.6815,3.7919,3.2819,0.8489,2.041,2.4565,0.6273,1.8453,1.1676,4.3229,4.2096,4.5904,2.7119,5.4788,2.3137,4.2738,0.5099,1.2228,3.4199,1.1771,1.0407,6.4493,0.8682,4.8802,1.941,4.9219,2.0137,1.9703,3.0399,0.4333,4.4244,5.4831,3.4782,4.7134,0.5052,3.5378,1.3806,0.526,0.0003,3.9501,1.521,1.2845,0.0838,2.9331,0.3681,4.6433,1.4316,6.1937,0.036,4.438,2.3687,3.3126,0.9569,2.6197,1.7638,0.6846,2.2861,3.9757,1.6442,4.9263,3.2005,0.7785,2.5419,4.7545,4.1118,2.4006,2.9178,5.0959,1.6254,5.5576,1.4823,1.4941,4.1033,1.2027,1.8682,4.1052,1.6876,3.0624,0.0798,0.5745,5.1016,0.4023,0.2298,0.9506,0.0002,4.9342,1.2816,1.8601,1.5948,2.6642,3.3857,1.0636,1.7231,4.0201,3.0392,3.8635,2.2217,0.693,1.3177]}
{"id":4318,"ended":false,"length":576,"gen_text":"You wake up with silicone breasts. You are male. Try to figure out what happened last night. You are going to sleep in the bathtub. Go on with your day\n\nThe woman is already awake. She looks happy. She looks nice.\n\nThe man in the shower takes a hard step and he reaches inside with his hand\n\nHe begins pulling you away from his body and inside of you.\n\nHe starts on each side, and at one point at the other it feels like he is going to touch you. As we're talking you notice that all your muscles ache.\n\nHe starts walking on between you and your partner.\n\nHe starts on the other hand. If you do this you will feel relaxed and happy, more like being in another room. You will feel like you are in her body.\n\nYou begin to feel some sensation in and around your nipples. You think, \"That's beautiful.\" And you feel happy.\n\nYou feel some feeling of sexiness.\n\nFinally you decide to try out any number of things. A date. You go on a dating site like Davenport.com or OkBasket.com. They accept your details.\n\nYou feel comfortable in your body, which is so beautiful right now. Your body is your own. So what if you want more? If you don't want to be too attached then you don't need to worry about this stuff.\n\nBut then as you find yourself in an amazing body look, you get scared and get into a rush. You go to the bathroom to pee, get yourself dressed and start dressing the rest of the way up. When your body feels this high, you know there is something wrong. It is in the wrong ways.\n\nYou have to try this and it may take a while. But before you make the time, you want to know what it is you don't want.\n\nI am so excited about this. I was really nervous, but you know what could be possible? I want to get naked right here.\n\nIf I stay naked, I can walk around in the grass and see that there are so many different looking bodies. We can all be naked.\n\nThis is just what is needed. There is absolutely nothing wrong with nakedness. I just wanted you to know.\n\nEven if you think about it now you can't do it. If she isn't naked enough, it means you need some sex.\n\nThe women in this post were chosen so that we could have one of your own pictures. It is so flattering that I am sharing our picture. The women included are a very few. Let all of these women look at the picture and have a big smile.\n\nOh man, this one is real\n\nI was inspired by this one.

The real challenge facing IBM would be looking for a good way to run programs such as this. There's a lot of research into how to do this, and if it's good enough, it probably won't work anywhere else.\n\n. There's a lot of research into how to do this, and if it's good enough, it probably won't work anywhere else. After learning about some of the other things it says in its introduction, IBM says in this paper: \"While it will become increasingly clear in future generations, this fact is not the only reason why some have held that it is wrong.\" The new findings might serve as a useful test: The computer will eventually be able to run applications such as these that do not require basic programming knowledge.\n\nthat don't require basic programming knowledge. IBM's work could help make AI more accessible. When people see that the game they play has more details that can communicate with each other like human vision can, and that they don't have to worry about using data to understand it and can play games using words, you're going to be in for a lot of trouble at some point.\n\n. When people see that the game they play has more details that can communicate with each other like human vision can, and that they don't have to worry about using data to understand it and can play games using words, you're going to be in for a lot of trouble at some point. IBM hopes this will help convince some of its customers that AI is more affordable. IBM already made some sort of promise that its machines make more dollars. It also has an important part of the market waiting for AI: A new kind of computer could do all of the things that humans do and can think about and make the world's most efficient machines.\n\n. IBM has some parts of the world that could be useful for AI. This research is \"a very positive new piece of work,\" according to an IBM spokesperson. The work is designed to try to help IBM figure out what it needs more, to take steps it might need faster to take a machine's intelligence into account, and to help IBM make it run better on big data.\n\n. IBM also has \"a real concern about some areas that are more expensive,\" according to the company's new statement, which says the work will help drive down production costs.\n\nRead more: IBM to announce a new chip making \"the most intelligent game-playing machine ever to exist.\" We'll start reading on at 9 p.m. ET.","token_len":639,"entropy":[8.8132,2.5884,12.3736,0.4206,10.8129,0.0863,1.7734,2.0659,4.2299,3.9565,2.2883,7.2009,3.0246,8.461,2.5682,8.5153,3.5044,8.3227,0.0368,0.92,1.6773,0.0081,7.5559,3.4242,1.7252,0.0234,0.0006,0.0114,0.0009,0.285,0.0049,0.0086,0.0015,9.5838,2.2039,2.9817,3.1634,5.3458,7.7172,3.5001,5.1223,0.1366,0.3347,1.5931,2.7943,1.8401,0.1524,4.4335,4.3918,0.8884,1.218,0.0003,1.1967,4.9332,5.0067,0.3444,2.6527,2.1454,1.5555,1.1761,5.0416,4.9052,0.005,5.7667,2.8228,0.0002,3.3211,6.344,4.932,3.9918,2.7797,3.4562,1.1789,3.4026,4.3416,1.318,2.2964,0.3766,5.8176,5.2782,2.2386,2.3923,1.8549,4.6421,1.3986,2.2341,0.3327,4.3461,5.4876,0.493,6.6864,5.6249,0.812,0.7992,0.6796,4.5202,5.181,0.962,2.0525,5.117,4.1021,4.1891,1.26,0.7862,0.0003,0.4318,3.7568,2.9261,1.3887,2.0803,3.5642,0.6362,2.0484,7.4116,2.1328,0.3552,0.0674,0.0833,3.3436,1.5068,1.6084,0.0009,2.2144,3.9101,5.0064,5.0743,6.7723,5.1088,5.1074,0.1474,6.2493,1.6669,2.0943,4.5112,1.7748,0.0702,4.4784,4.3794,5.1098,0.002,1.2484,1.0771,4.7043,1.0083,1.2026,1.2492,0.1679,4.1495,2.7375,1.8461,0.7838,0.8391,1.2207,1.9022,1.8691,3.9496,1.9351,1.465,3.7418,0.3928,0.7414,1.2444,4.9858,2.1074,0.0003,2.0059,4.9136,0.2557,0.2781,0.5368,0.0002,0.1733,3.7994,0.6566,0.6751,0.3038,0.0143,0.3322,0.008,0.0389,0.0019,0.0533,0.0149,0.0242,0.0049,0.0008,0.0065,0.0024,0.0051,0.0,0.0009,0.0055,0.0092,0.0063,0.0,0.0056,0.0191,0.0019,0.0031,6.5463,5.3813,1.7791,4.6681,0.7626,0.4322,3.6423,3.0917,3.5533,3.8105,2.9602,1.3751,5.3782,0.5331,1.437,2.6246,4.08,4.7256,4.4129,1.7238,0.7934,5.1679,2.3642,4.3432,5.3063,1.7291,3.2634,2.8422,1.862,2.8574,2.6103,3.3265,5.333,1.5605,1.3159,3.5785,1.6596,2.2653,2.0522,4.1206,5.4242,4.8266,1.5148,2.2756,0.672,4.227,1.923,3.4585,4.9391,4.2222,4.8309,5.6852,0.3724,0.6175,3.9931,4.157,5.233,3.6593,4.2692,3.5533,2.9187,1.3778,0.1779,0.0044,2.7114,5.328,2.1492,0.0017,3.8156,1.6091,4.4744,0.757,1.0508,5.6429,1.6841,2.114,0.6457,0.6383,0.0003,8.1077,5.8491,0.0018,0.0118,0.0095,0.0158,0.009,0.0061,1.2021,2.2017,4.6086,3.3859,1.4983,3.9712,5.399,1.6895,2.4261,2.2222,5.4192,3.7237,3.5254,2.1565,2.7476,5.4212,3.5558,1.9184,3.3374,3.7169,6.1554,4.3198,2.864,6.6899,0.7899,2.3428,0.0172,5.9734,3.908,5.0206,3.732,0.5875,4.2186,1.6628,2.3692,3.8872,0.0005,1.1551,0.1482,2.812,0.0811,5.0154,5.2971,1.2083,3.3087,2.9987,4.205,4.6917,3.656,2.22,4.8335,5.0264,1.343,5.1062,3.0322,1.4012,0.0046,1.7747,4.9694,2.0501,0.3234,2.4915,0.2181,1.7249,6.1915,1.4177,0.0672,0.1592,0.6366,0.0003,0.8899,1.4043,0.0924,0.0047,0.0027,0.0025,0.0017,0.0101,0.0014,0.0015,0.0011,0.0036,0.0056,0.005,0.0044,0.0003,0.0018,0.0014,0.0007,0.0042,0.0003,0.0017,0.0011,0.0008,0.0047,0.0038,0.011,0.0004,0.0113,0.0005,0.0028,0.0004,0.0017,0.0073,0.0016,0.004,0.0012,0.0017,0.0054,0.0159,0.0023,0.0161,0.0022,0.0062,0.0033,0.0065,0.0006,0.0011,0.0017,0.0033,0.0013,0.0064,0.0028,0.0006,0.0007,0.0037,0.0008,0.0039,0.0013,0.9095,5.9453,2.9341,1.491,1.2199,5.1835,3.2697,1.424,0.7243,1.6747,0.7711,2.3075,0.7918,3.6146,5.1313,1.9615,2.8405,5.0364,5.4799,2.5553,5.3061,0.0011,4.5902,2.6138,3.2934,3.8007,7.5417,1.9126,6.9664,2.9753,2.4832,3.6272,3.1105,3.2016,4.7118,3.6889,1.6937,0.9759,2.6911,5.3513,0.6871,4.0614,2.6182,4.3459,3.2652,2.7591,0.0021,2.5292,3.7774,4.0295,3.2004,1.6542,0.7359,1.4539,1.4247,1.9912,1.1065,3.3059,3.4107,5.7286,0.9708,1.7726,3.688,3.7831,0.757,4.9261,1.8657,2.2958,1.7257,0.4683,0.7146,0.0003,0.6588,0.4696,1.7387,3.6669,4.4943,0.3599,0.3878,2.1426,1.1755,3.2759,1.2052,3.4853,1.0499,1.1797,1.292,4.3624,4.7634,2.0124,5.4866,2.6196,2.8879,5.0238,6.5402,4.5544,0.2578,2.4602,1.1951,3.4115,0.0011,4.0416,0.1745,1.6314,0.3421,2.7235,4.2578,1.1511,4.5325,0.2202,4.9856,0.4415,3.1643,2.2382,5.6619,0.0154,1.8417,1.3913,1.2364,5.4952,3.4443,4.1654,5.175,4.9245,3.2275,3.0364,4.5413,6.013,1.8108,4.9986,3.1813,3.1343,3.2538,4.5049,3.2527,0.4028,1.5177,0.3735,0.4819,2.4038,2.1246,2.6298,2.7732,5.8092,1.7615,2.1559,4.9699,0.8027,0.6064,0.7391,0.0003,0.3646,0.7517,4.3292,1.1916,5.1885,1.3282,5.7945,4.265,1.1696,4.7326,4.2259,2.0265,1.349,3.6153,3.3794,1.7105,1.2018,0.0029,2.022,1.9952,0.4757,4.1857,2.7882,2.8089,1.2526,1.7898,2.36,2.645,1.5259,0.9777,3.8897,1.4747,7.1412,0.037,0.953,1.4165,0.0002,6.1669,1.2253,1.2802,2.5242,3.9472,4.0819,2.9568,1.035,5.2193,5.8237,4.8466,4.0205,1.3927,2.2897,5.0409,4.8467,1.0443,1.3913,0.8813,3.8253,2.5438,0.6488,5.7178,2.0263,4.7863,4.5996,2.8639,3.9907,2.5001,1.3756,0.0005,0.0003,0.0362,0.5577,1.1314]}
{"id":4889,"ended":false,"length":625,"gen_text":"While rummaging through a box of arts and crafts you created as a young child, you find a picture you drew. It is titled `` Me and my sister. '' You have never had a sister... your father died in that war and you were not able to bring him home to your mother because he died with them. You did not leave him until the War, and that's why you didn\ufffdt come back until you were 19- years old. So you saw yourself as a great artist and when the war ended he made your drawings and you took him to where he wanted to go and it became easy to reach for new objects or pieces. The problem was you never knew where your mother went and you didn\ufffdt know why her home had turned into a castle. If you did, the problem would come back for you.\"\n\nWhen asked what she did more difficult than being a child, Mr Wilson said, ''I was an excellent school teacher. There were really no problems, no problems that I can recall. As far as I can tell I was an outstanding kid. I have seen things I never thought possible, I have seen things I never thought would happen. I went to the school on the morning of the 20th April to see what was going on and I was amazed to hear it would happen,'' he said. \"I saw the sky, the landscape which was so beautiful, the people around there were so young... So I put on a blue dress, I put on my black skirt, I put on my black panties, I got my boots.\"\n\nIn the end, he took his sister to a picture booth, where she went out into the park and took pictures. Mrs Wilson said she did not think, then and now the picture was taken. In her final analysis, Mrs Wilson had worked with her at the beginning of the war and at the end of the war. She did not think her sister, who grew up in a small house with few windows, would have this type of exposure over a short period of time.\n\nMrs Wilson said she never even saw the last of her sister's pictures for the next half century, but she remembers feeling, through photographs she did take at home, that something was wrong with her sister. ''What was that? I am trying again to find my sister, not be afraid of my sister. The day after the war one of the things I remember most is she sitting in her pajamas with her arms around me. '' I thought, now that the first picture had been taken she could not believe who, and I think I would have laughed it off because someone needed to be told the story. What did her picture look like on that day when she was younger? I mean, she was dressed to my grandmother's specifications. We always kept all of our pictures together. I knew everything that there was to see, everything we needed to know about the war, her life, the wars that were going on. How much was it that we could learn and how much it would help our sister understand the real story of what happened to her life once she had her portrait finished?''","token_len":640,"entropy":[10.9841,4.0532,0.0442,0.1347,3.1473,4.2172,0.3879,10.8043,0.9001,0.1117,6.1013,11.163,4.1832,0.4141,3.6943,1.3297,0.6534,0.4919,2.0584,1.1935,5.5707,5.9202,7.5831,2.842,2.4992,2.3906,7.39,9.5018,12.9452,3.7217,2.0468,4.9203,2.8981,3.076,2.7328,3.344,4.3856,3.6239,1.0038,5.8949,6.7428,6.0631,2.9685,3.2972,1.7315,5.7104,2.8116,1.9562,1.2987,1.7995,3.7269,2.9914,0.0049,4.5964,2.3566,1.2782,2.7107,2.0649,1.9659,3.6981,1.8893,2.4148,4.4074,5.8872,0.6021,1.8622,4.6551,0.3794,5.252,2.7895,2.7201,2.7439,5.2152,3.2749,1.6874,3.5783,2.6265,1.8742,0.6301,3.5876,6.1339,0.0028,3.3148,0.659,2.0149,1.3254,0.7995,3.846,5.1252,5.387,0.0759,0.305,3.3901,1.2491,5.6872,3.5445,0.7683,0.7709,5.0998,2.6889,1.5374,5.3617,3.4921,0.4662,1.0416,4.3714,4.5312,3.4037,3.6908,1.6516,1.5634,3.4907,3.1167,1.4048,6.0126,0.8972,3.9841,0.4356,1.0107,2.1958,4.3393,2.8808,6.5765,1.0807,5.6491,1.8727,5.5515,4.8458,4.3668,5.6034,1.4121,3.365,5.6314,0.9127,2.446,3.1423,1.6355,1.1678,2.7978,4.093,3.219,2.3811,1.3934,1.9437,0.0189,0.0005,0.529,4.2623,3.0523,3.823,3.073,4.1468,0.7672,0.643,4.3884,0.6734,5.0736,0.3282,3.552,1.8152,3.1027,3.7803,0.7483,3.7788,0.7674,4.3444,0.1729,4.8222,1.2184,0.0195,3.9459,3.6207,1.9429,2.3208,3.1357,6.0723,4.569,0.6231,3.9664,0.7656,2.4922,1.5749,5.6771,7.405,1.1046,1.1539,2.727,1.2695,2.7508,3.8512,5.1501,4.4452,0.7958,1.1543,4.6154,1.0646,5.3571,1.8152,1.5332,3.0032,2.2454,1.5386,2.9161,1.294,3.8643,2.53,1.0218,4.8877,2.5943,0.0036,0.903,2.8301,0.6149,2.2547,1.3311,3.4847,2.4102,5.7838,0.8996,0.7618,3.7479,4.2898,4.0864,2.1783,1.9171,1.3617,2.5098,1.8201,2.1499,0.7463,0.5446,0.1949,0.6954,0.7587,0.9368,3.0272,0.5333,0.8469,0.791,4.6409,0.5451,2.4637,2.964,4.3927,2.336,4.6447,0.2428,0.721,4.8694,0.0168,6.0262,3.295,1.9752,1.8341,1.052,0.5146,0.2707,1.6474,1.0615,1.6949,3.1452,2.6188,4.057,3.7475,4.3532,2.8878,7.6306,0.5043,0.2607,0.0574,2.5179,0.9168,3.7426,2.0562,5.791,2.4826,1.2972,5.5256,7.2785,1.0298,2.624,1.2112,1.3697,1.6335,3.628,3.6286,5.877,3.4861,1.2926,4.1925,5.2902,6.0069,0.86,5.6098,2.0498,1.4157,4.6012,2.4674,1.8563,1.8926,2.2278,0.0462,1.957,3.3875,4.7073,0.9997,0.3878,0.5084,0.015,0.503,1.8359,5.3217,0.9573,0.3932,3.8226,1.9831,4.5673,4.6929,0.3211,0.0002,3.113,1.9355,2.979,0.525,1.2894,4.6355,1.4045,4.5409,1.2478,1.9792,5.7066,4.662,2.5074,1.8307,1.2078,4.6926,3.7778,3.8479,0.1068,5.0336,1.375,3.3162,1.5225,1.7941,4.5515,0.4636,1.7451,1.4174,2.9553,0.2209,2.542,6.0217,4.8916,3.6213,0.2381,5.1089,2.6677,1.5828,1.0503,0.8527,4.4557,2.6914,3.7666,5.4823,0.3504,1.51,0.0195,3.4059,5.2513,2.8316,2.2926,5.7316,1.1595,5.9782,0.3723,0.5059,0.4364,1.3687,4.161,0.4218,0.4239,0.3807,0.5886,0.0902,1.8659,1.631,3.9722,0.2218,1.8047,3.2317,1.8174,3.5548,1.279,5.6175,0.016,0.7004,1.4785,2.7967,2.7729,1.8092,4.4645,2.3233,0.6025,0.833,2.2683,4.5868,4.5586,0.0031,5.4463,6.6958,2.1037,4.4428,0.2422,0.1261,0.0044,0.3985,1.1247,0.0003,2.6979,0.0299,1.283,1.0155,3.943,5.4007,2.5828,1.7182,5.7906,1.4014,0.8989,0.8568,1.3165,2.2177,4.9495,1.6817,3.2425,5.1851,1.8883,1.9665,1.8967,0.9539,4.2006,4.1404,4.564,5.4773,4.4559,2.6471,3.8751,2.5812,4.058,1.5435,0.364,0.6235,3.6713,1.2099,1.417,1.6374,0.5086,1.7285,0.3768,1.8032,4.76,2.1211,3.1249,2.0156,1.7663,4.748,4.7993,5.8501,1.3361,1.8125,3.1323,0.3719,1.868,4.5251,5.7764,2.8043,1.2316,3.3745,0.777,1.4565,4.2109,5.2809,1.5749,1.157,0.2881,6.9995,0.5656,1.3976,2.8865,0.7213,3.0191,1.6285,1.9694,3.5243,5.2439,1.4201,2.3951,5.4093,0.1761,0.0993,2.433,0.5682,2.8611,2.3736,1.2675,1.5315,3.5303,2.7463,3.6072,1.6255,5.4968,2.0942,3.4934,6.0534,1.6375,3.5489,0.5937,0.0599,2.8435,3.3451,1.7688,2.6136,6.5761,6.749,2.6031,1.4405,2.7624,1.8985,3.5429,0.709,4.7748,4.6122,0.0715,3.7669,6.4675,6.0425,0.211,2.2194,3.4605,3.1981,2.0436,1.3283,4.9519,2.8029,3.9647,4.0609,2.262,0.0024,4.1203,2.1813,0.8531,3.7761,0.9767,0.8573,5.0882,0.5077,1.9647,4.3902,0.8262,1.7285,1.0594,4.1194,4.7095,5.8234,4.4379,1.2983,2.9005,1.3354,4.7237,5.0383,4.7602,5.1816,1.8286,1.2465,1.7731,2.892,1.6654,1.6885,4.3107,5.1895,2.9933,5.6839,0.1134,0.1776,1.9287,1.6584,2.5174,3.1729,2.3029,0.0946,0.8828,1.6559,1.8247,0.8845,1.7836,5.8014,1.6028,1.0558,2.0491,5.4104,1.9162,1.5843,0.6732,0.023,1.26,5.8386,3.6561,2.8223,2.4487,2.0347,2.372,2.1385,3.5485,3.3032,1.8926,0.5755,3.5644,0.7188,2.0265,3.6594,2.437,4.4079,1.9842,4.6591,2.2686,0.7891,1.8015,1.0074,1.8198,0.3092,4.5388,6.7344,0.682,1.9821,3.7682,4.5947,6.223,1.0391,2.3619]}

But I knew you were a great-looking man. \"\n\n\"What? Oh, I'm okay. Sorry. Oh! I'm happy. Now I'm ready.\"\n\nI've been looking on the internet, and I can't seem to find it. I feel so helpless. All I have is one more person with so much hate on me.\n\nI can't wait to find out for myself what happened to me, with this one stranger. Is that his fault or your fault? Or are you a monster that has no place in the group and has gone too far with hate?\n\n\"You know, I hope some day it stops working. We will get it, and there won't be anything we can do to stop it from happening again.\"\n\n\"Ugh!! This doesn't stop me. This wasn't really on purpose.\"\n\n\"You know. I can't wait. But I know that your hate is very real. I know you've made lots of attempts. When your hate gets so bad so often, it only makes it worse. It's only fair. Sometimes we just make mistakes. But you made no attempt to stop my life.\"\n\n\"Please! Please let me help. Please forgive as much as you can. Then I will help you get to a place where you won't feel like you are having to deal with it anymore, and I can help you feel better afterward. That's how I know this is going to work out. I can help you feel at ease again. Your love is as real as my love is, right now.\"\n\n\"If I didn't love you for this\u2026 you'd never know what you were thinking. Oh, and if it was only when you realized it, you'd start worrying that we could be friends again. If your love, love, loves are on one side or the other, then you'd feel better now, too.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"But you thought so. Sorry, but we just have to continue this.\"\n\nWhat should I do with my love now? Should I be looking after it over and over and over again\u2026 or over and over again? If she isn't with me, does this really mean it's time to leave this place?\n\nI think so\u2026 What does her relationship look like on that level? She seems happier, does she care? How does she feel like she has a safe home here all of these years?\n\nIt wasn't the first thing that happened to me at this point. It wasn't her fault. It wasn't her. She had the chance to be there, and she did it with a smile and a smile filled in the face by something that no one saw coming.\n\nThis is my first book, so it will have to wait until after they finish. Until then I just need to tell everyone my story here.\n\nAdvertisements","token_len":640,"entropy":[7.934,3.7952,1.6493,6.0727,4.2358,1.333,3.1831,6.2435,0.0005,0.6196,2.3729,7.4691,0.8996,5.2074,1.3856,0.025,1.5326,3.4023,2.3932,0.1701,1.3983,0.0095,1.458,5.2474,0.6691,4.8943,1.2283,1.1442,1.5709,1.869,2.9326,2.3436,2.0707,0.3128,3.1959,1.0515,0.3526,2.2578,0.8858,2.7055,1.3389,5.8499,1.3497,1.1671,2.6646,4.0229,5.4135,1.0818,2.3273,0.8883,1.927,0.2281,0.0003,0.4274,3.4014,1.8815,2.4016,0.4141,1.6027,1.5105,6.042,0.6896,4.5686,0.9911,4.3411,4.2252,1.6672,1.2369,5.3467,1.2065,5.1038,1.9906,1.2652,4.0505,2.4655,0.2802,0.0003,3.8678,4.5161,1.544,3.6134,5.3259,1.4185,2.1962,3.3686,1.6164,1.1111,2.1689,0.9493,2.9721,0.0006,0.3874,3.9372,0.7459,1.1941,4.3014,3.0734,4.1861,0.8728,5.0424,0.5023,3.3417,0.6867,3.9653,3.0008,4.0456,4.2492,5.456,0.5083,5.1328,1.9142,0.868,0.6843,1.4325,0.0003,1.5962,3.0037,0.2255,4.1982,0.5159,2.932,0.2929,5.661,1.0299,2.9292,1.941,0.9041,1.0778,2.3667,6.2156,2.7373,3.7791,4.7107,0.768,6.1014,2.3548,4.5133,3.4007,2.7361,4.6655,0.5883,0.2184,2.8564,2.4507,0.2824,3.6418,3.3985,2.6426,3.0983,2.4921,2.4491,0.6338,2.1332,5.4993,3.2579,2.8682,5.3479,3.4977,0.0166,3.5345,6.0163,0.7972,0.7782,0.0003,2.8544,2.665,2.3725,1.1699,1.1657,5.4623,5.8065,1.3716,3.8672,4.6604,5.489,1.3622,4.2238,4.0926,2.8256,4.1939,5.3861,2.3501,4.387,2.5421,0.0003,0.0274,3.3538,3.6336,0.4058,0.115,1.6134,0.8486,0.4569,2.5236,0.6842,0.2395,1.0981,0.2042,0.0002,1.5442,5.2275,0.8149,7.2186,4.6989,4.8058,0.0003,3.8163,1.5445,1.8326,3.2065,5.9191,0.0003,4.7823,5.9859,1.7289,2.7811,0.155,0.0002,0.7481,2.5701,2.1506,3.7503,1.3904,3.7358,0.5017,3.0324,1.8841,3.5655,1.1523,3.022,2.2349,4.6819,4.0945,1.3908,4.8066,1.1992,0.7118,1.4287,1.749,1.9386,3.2108,3.6526,5.2745,0.0219,4.2988,3.1187,5.5442,4.1511,2.5856,2.8756,1.8026,2.1448,6.3704,2.8193,0.4872,1.2893,4.9884,1.1893,1.9714,0.249,0.3803,2.583,0.915,3.8651,3.5858,1.8763,5.702,2.9226,2.0839,4.4701,3.044,0.8217,2.1055,2.425,2.9733,4.9355,3.0611,1.0869,0.4345,4.3712,4.9035,2.913,0.0413,0.0002,0.5899,5.5909,4.1488,1.5797,3.9806,0.4571,3.8432,2.9108,1.647,3.9319,7.8459,0.3224,0.1973,0.637,0.351,0.4757,6.0797,1.0155,1.7289,2.6398,0.2499,3.4094,3.5216,2.653,0.7196,0.3421,0.4337,2.6845,0.0003,2.4377,1.9075,1.4824,2.3756,4.4736,1.1736,1.5168,0.0091,1.9637,1.0602,3.3349,1.2939,1.7868,2.6207,1.4984,0.1024,4.2812,0.9782,7.0533,0.5804,3.795,0.6777,2.8468,0.9575,1.8036,3.8038,0.8446,1.8703,0.014,0.8412,1.7437,0.998,1.5201,2.4343,1.7266,0.173,2.4097,5.1483,1.3311,2.4486,0.7171,5.0884,2.6965,1.6149,4.8986,2.3411,0.2242,3.4222,1.2043,2.0299,2.6463,4.5161,2.0516,1.1755,0.0566,0.0002,0.8451,4.9028,1.7268,3.2025,0.0005,2.9316,0.1343,5.1058,3.7837,4.5741,4.2802,1.8855,1.8415,1.7457,2.7491,1.7223,1.5969,2.4848,0.6858,4.712,0.5481,2.3355,2.4729,3.0419,2.363,3.8102,5.8156,1.0193,4.4075,1.5749,1.1831,1.2208,0.8955,5.4918,4.4849,3.542,3.9465,3.8669,2.6026,2.0739,0.6537,0.5503,4.0222,4.0436,1.1292,5.7839,2.5395,0.7561,4.9402,2.5451,5.1093,4.8833,0.6754,1.7147,0.1565,0.0005,0.4976,1.1868,1.7244,1.9571,3.4525,1.9853,3.1834,1.8171,2.7677,1.2423,0.0549,0.0002,0.6957,1.7765,1.7294,4.1573,0.3403,0.0002,0.9792,2.8889,1.6129,5.8636,2.7515,0.8078,5.9974,1.6365,1.3698,3.5459,3.7781,2.2653,0.1561,5.3353,2.9639,2.773,0.0825,0.0003,5.8639,4.6283,0.2417,0.107,3.6124,1.5859,2.8989,2.5933,0.3093,3.4822,0.049,3.3492,4.8701,4.1784,1.7434,6.4324,0.8726,0.0047,1.8064,0.1847,0.678,5.0242,1.3753,6.5253,0.0642,0.0136,0.4794,0.6897,3.7689,5.1138,4.3636,0.0002,3.1965,0.0415,0.9528,4.6439,2.3624,2.6597,1.7379,4.2588,0.7613,1.6289,0.4822,1.6082,4.2562,0.8699,0.3447,0.7918,0.0003,1.6301,3.6291,3.6919,4.0712,5.4065,4.0624,4.0315,3.9361,1.5546,0.0003,4.9187,3.849,2.3456,0.3425,3.4717,3.065,6.1424,2.0364,6.1581,0.3299,3.2556,1.425,4.0801,1.318,0.5463,0.79,4.6065,1.0538,2.5465,1.5531,4.6224,2.3056,3.1297,7.5256,2.457,3.2225,0.1679,0.4173,1.2048,0.0002,3.3707,5.4388,0.0003,3.4817,1.2939,5.9853,1.4874,1.8666,0.2716,0.4955,4.0174,1.6429,0.827,0.5762,2.586,1.847,0.0002,4.3702,0.8909,1.1096,1.0373,0.7939,0.0003,1.9882,2.9647,2.1809,2.9737,4.0992,4.0047,0.2378,2.4922,3.4261,2.356,1.519,1.1423,1.8568,1.6014,3.4392,2.1286,0.9171,3.125,0.4104,1.3452,6.367,6.5834,2.7649,2.8757,4.8401,5.4429,1.3989,4.2872,0.4193,5.0983,0.6769,0.1911,0.6227,0.0003,4.0145,1.4264,2.4339,2.3185,6.1199,1.4624,1.5271,2.176,3.1068,3.5537,0.4394,1.3786,1.5676,2.5941,5.4898,1.7508,2.2594,5.0777,0.619,2.2438,3.485,2.8888,0.225,4.2303,3.1458,4.7913,0.3606,5.147,0.7046,0.8007,0.0004,3.0897]}

Until then I just need to tell everyone my story here.\n\nAdvertisements","token_len":640,"entropy":[7.934,3.7952,1.6493,6.0727,4.2358,1.333,3.1831,6.2435,0.0005,0.6196,2.3729,7.4691,0.8996,5.2074,1.3856,0.025,1.5326,3.4023,2.3932,0.1701,1.3983,0.0095,1.458,5.2474,0.6691,4.8943,1.2283,1.1442,1.5709,1.869,2.9326,2.3436,2.0707,0.3128,3.1959,1.0515,0.3526,2.2578,0.8858,2.7055,1.3389,5.8499,1.3497,1.1671,2.6646,4.0229,5.4135,1.0818,2.3273,0.8883,1.927,0.2281,0.0003,0.4274,3.4014,1.8815,2.4016,0.4141,1.6027,1.5105,6.042,0.6896,4.5686,0.9911,4.3411,4.2252,1.6672,1.2369,5.3467,1.2065,5.1038,1.9906,1.2652,4.0505,2.4655,0.2802,0.0003,3.8678,4.5161,1.544,3.6134,5.3259,1.4185,2.1962,3.3686,1.6164,1.1111,2.1689,0.9493,2.9721,0.0006,0.3874,3.9372,0.7459,1.1941,4.3014,3.0734,4.1861,0.8728,5.0424,0.5023,3.3417,0.6867,3.9653,3.0008,4.0456,4.2492,5.456,0.5083,5.1328,1.9142,0.868,0.6843,1.4325,0.0003,1.5962,3.0037,0.2255,4.1982,0.5159,2.932,0.2929,5.661,1.0299,2.9292,1.941,0.9041,1.0778,2.3667,6.2156,2.7373,3.7791,4.7107,0.768,6.1014,2.3548,4.5133,3.4007,2.7361,4.6655,0.5883,0.2184,2.8564,2.4507,0.2824,3.6418,3.3985,2.6426,3.0983,2.4921,2.4491,0.6338,2.1332,5.4993,3.2579,2.8682,5.3479,3.4977,0.0166,3.5345,6.0163,0.7972,0.7782,0.0003,2.8544,2.665,2.3725,1.1699,1.1657,5.4623,5.8065,1.3716,3.8672,4.6604,5.489,1.3622,4.2238,4.0926,2.8256,4.1939,5.3861,2.3501,4.387,2.5421,0.0003,0.0274,3.3538,3.6336,0.4058,0.115,1.6134,0.8486,0.4569,2.5236,0.6842,0.2395,1.0981,0.2042,0.0002,1.5442,5.2275,0.8149,7.2186,4.6989,4.8058,0.0003,3.8163,1.5445,1.8326,3.2065,5.9191,0.0003,4.7823,5.9859,1.7289,2.7811,0.155,0.0002,0.7481,2.5701,2.1506,3.7503,1.3904,3.7358,0.5017,3.0324,1.8841,3.5655,1.1523,3.022,2.2349,4.6819,4.0945,1.3908,4.8066,1.1992,0.7118,1.4287,1.749,1.9386,3.2108,3.6526,5.2745,0.0219,4.2988,3.1187,5.5442,4.1511,2.5856,2.8756,1.8026,2.1448,6.3704,2.8193,0.4872,1.2893,4.9884,1.1893,1.9714,0.249,0.3803,2.583,0.915,3.8651,3.5858,1.8763,5.702,2.9226,2.0839,4.4701,3.044,0.8217,2.1055,2.425,2.9733,4.9355,3.0611,1.0869,0.4345,4.3712,4.9035,2.913,0.0413,0.0002,0.5899,5.5909,4.1488,1.5797,3.9806,0.4571,3.8432,2.9108,1.647,3.9319,7.8459,0.3224,0.1973,0.637,0.351,0.4757,6.0797,1.0155,1.7289,2.6398,0.2499,3.4094,3.5216,2.653,0.7196,0.3421,0.4337,2.6845,0.0003,2.4377,1.9075,1.4824,2.3756,4.4736,1.1736,1.5168,0.0091,1.9637,1.0602,3.3349,1.2939,1.7868,2.6207,1.4984,0.1024,4.2812,0.9782,7.0533,0.5804,3.795,0.6777,2.8468,0.9575,1.8036,3.8038,0.8446,1.8703,0.014,0.8412,1.7437,0.998,1.5201,2.4343,1.7266,0.173,2.4097,5.1483,1.3311,2.4486,0.7171,5.0884,2.6965,1.6149,4.8986,2.3411,0.2242,3.4222,1.2043,2.0299,2.6463,4.5161,2.0516,1.1755,0.0566,0.0002,0.8451,4.9028,1.7268,3.2025,0.0005,2.9316,0.1343,5.1058,3.7837,4.5741,4.2802,1.8855,1.8415,1.7457,2.7491,1.7223,1.5969,2.4848,0.6858,4.712,0.5481,2.3355,2.4729,3.0419,2.363,3.8102,5.8156,1.0193,4.4075,1.5749,1.1831,1.2208,0.8955,5.4918,4.4849,3.542,3.9465,3.8669,2.6026,2.0739,0.6537,0.5503,4.0222,4.0436,1.1292,5.7839,2.5395,0.7561,4.9402,2.5451,5.1093,4.8833,0.6754,1.7147,0.1565,0.0005,0.4976,1.1868,1.7244,1.9571,3.4525,1.9853,3.1834,1.8171,2.7677,1.2423,0.0549,0.0002,0.6957,1.7765,1.7294,4.1573,0.3403,0.0002,0.9792,2.8889,1.6129,5.8636,2.7515,0.8078,5.9974,1.6365,1.3698,3.5459,3.7781,2.2653,0.1561,5.3353,2.9639,2.773,0.0825,0.0003,5.8639,4.6283,0.2417,0.107,3.6124,1.5859,2.8989,2.5933,0.3093,3.4822,0.049,3.3492,4.8701,4.1784,1.7434,6.4324,0.8726,0.0047,1.8064,0.1847,0.678,5.0242,1.3753,6.5253,0.0642,0.0136,0.4794,0.6897,3.7689,5.1138,4.3636,0.0002,3.1965,0.0415,0.9528,4.6439,2.3624,2.6597,1.7379,4.2588,0.7613,1.6289,0.4822,1.6082,4.2562,0.8699,0.3447,0.7918,0.0003,1.6301,3.6291,3.6919,4.0712,5.4065,4.0624,4.0315,3.9361,1.5546,0.0003,4.9187,3.849,2.3456,0.3425,3.4717,3.065,6.1424,2.0364,6.1581,0.3299,3.2556,1.425,4.0801,1.318,0.5463,0.79,4.6065,1.0538,2.5465,1.5531,4.6224,2.3056,3.1297,7.5256,2.457,3.2225,0.1679,0.4173,1.2048,0.0002,3.3707,5.4388,0.0003,3.4817,1.2939,5.9853,1.4874,1.8666,0.2716,0.4955,4.0174,1.6429,0.827,0.5762,2.586,1.847,0.0002,4.3702,0.8909,1.1096,1.0373,0.7939,0.0003,1.9882,2.9647,2.1809,2.9737,4.0992,4.0047,0.2378,2.4922,3.4261,2.356,1.519,1.1423,1.8568,1.6014,3.4392,2.1286,0.9171,3.125,0.4104,1.3452,6.367,6.5834,2.7649,2.8757,4.8401,5.4429,1.3989,4.2872,0.4193,5.0983,0.6769,0.1911,0.6227,0.0003,4.0145,1.4264,2.4339,2.3185,6.1199,1.4624,1.5271,2.176,3.1068,3.5537,0.4394,1.3786,1.5676,2.5941,5.4898,1.7508,2.2594,5.0777,0.619,2.2438,3.485,2.8888,0.225,4.2303,3.1458,4.7913,0.3606,5.147,0.7046,0.8007,0.0004,3.0897]}

I say make it extraordinary. That sounds like a good way for everyone to work together, not just one person.\"\n\nHe took part in workshops on the economy during his time at his first job. He received a job interview in January and began working in November 2011. He was granted a spot at North Texas United for new workers, after being promoted to vice president. (For more details on his time at North Texas United, visit www.tusullantos.org)\n\nMr. Trump's economic policy is not unusual. He's a business executive who can change jobs, his company has long championed its tax proposals, and he likes to give his tax plan some weight when it comes to what he describes as his \"American Idea.\"\n\nBut the business world does have a tendency to be very positive about his proposed regulations. In fact, while in Washington last fall, Mr. Reagan wrote a memorandum on his administration's transition plan, which called for tax cuts that would boost U.S. exports overseas.\n\nIn the first chapter, he wrote that \"a shift in the tax rates may be necessary in the current regime... \"\n\n\"Although taxes on the affluent increase every year,\" he wrote, \"the wealthy must also make a difference that the working poor find it important.\" The president's proposed tax changes are a \"big step in providing tax relief to the very rich that benefit the very rich and hurt the very poor.\" He described what he called \"the largest and most progressive tax on the U.S. economy in decades.\"\n\nMr. Trump's plans could also lead to new high-speed rail. On Wednesday, he released a memo for American railroads urging investment in the project, which would cost $2.1 billion over five years, and put a stop to any future rail projects. Other proposals have already been filed, including one that would use an underground tunnel to create the infrastructure to bring new power plants and railways to North Texas.\n\nBut even as Mr. Trump is working on his infrastructure blueprint, he's faced some opposition from trade leaders. Last November, Senator John Neely of Illinois, the ranking Republican on the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee, told the New York Times that the United States is not working, and noted that \"I am a man of tremendous strength to oppose that type of thing.\"\n\nOthers say they see that as good news and a step toward a more open market for goods and services.\n\n\"I don't like the idea of a tax on the rich that's based on a lot less than the rate on the middle class,\" said Tom Tingle, managing director of American Express Partners, whom Mr. Trump has long championed. \"This is about our economy growing in the United States, not in India, China or other countries in their countries. It will benefit us more and make sure that our workers are protected.\"\n\nWrite to Alexey Khashoggi at asataey.khashoggi@wsj.com","token_len":640,"entropy":[7.4809,10.6678,1.5536,4.6609,0.8611,4.0577,5.4568,4.0815,3.0047,4.7074,4.2043,2.3857,5.1876,1.1001,6.5162,3.132,2.2143,1.0483,1.7813,1.7545,2.6803,0.0005,3.5011,6.0694,1.1321,0.433,7.0538,4.8722,0.8775,0.9735,0.9203,3.1529,5.775,1.2918,1.0996,2.3517,2.3799,3.5672,5.2212,0.8226,4.4492,1.1227,2.1254,3.66,0.4354,2.3156,1.1397,1.75,0.3219,0.0004,3.2741,5.7057,3.1384,0.037,6.3361,1.7262,2.4053,5.1711,5.1816,1.0646,1.4725,1.4334,6.0804,5.7031,1.2543,2.7468,1.6225,5.029,1.2947,2.9975,3.31,2.0703,3.6736,2.6615,4.5024,1.4816,2.0947,3.9131,3.7066,0.539,1.8512,2.628,5.3752,0.703,5.9162,1.9208,6.5342,4.7884,5.5361,3.6493,6.3595,4.7739,1.9524,4.4229,2.8901,3.1391,0.4625,3.0821,0.3751,1.6059,5.7942,5.2484,0.9444,3.0053,1.0833,1.6195,2.9119,0.2315,0.513,0.0377,0.173,0.1487,2.2782,1.7793,0.0005,4.0142,3.2946,4.3202,3.8706,5.7027,1.634,2.3006,2.3802,0.1535,0.0003,5.4121,0.3999,4.3027,1.7737,5.2361,2.9265,2.1786,2.6161,3.4551,1.2441,1.6154,3.1916,3.6807,4.1903,3.2442,1.5203,5.3198,5.2859,3.3564,1.7532,5.6615,4.4331,2.6915,4.876,5.553,4.1053,4.6093,5.3911,0.8279,0.2212,0.7657,5.7101,0.3877,4.898,1.9949,3.3635,2.0093,4.0315,4.5269,3.3304,1.473,0.0777,0.0289,5.1322,0.7107,4.3499,0.0128,1.9404,0.9365,5.3019,5.7925,0.3469,0.6071,0.0002,1.7063,2.6802,4.4218,3.3596,4.3059,3.2338,1.2277,3.2099,0.1679,2.8909,4.0998,5.0529,0.6725,1.7832,5.0626,4.5126,0.7159,2.4678,3.3738,0.0166,5.0349,4.5507,3.2517,1.6353,3.2736,0.495,1.6004,0.0014,6.4711,4.8892,1.2295,4.9744,2.8838,2.9941,3.9979,0.0538,5.5365,1.7296,1.7433,1.4111,2.8561,0.0469,5.8608,1.0397,3.4989,0.9175,3.5012,3.4823,0.0002,0.001,0.0135,1.8091,6.8214,1.3952,0.8527,0.0002,2.7908,2.0658,5.0421,5.1665,0.9206,1.4819,2.3834,0.9143,1.7153,3.7502,5.135,1.5221,1.5941,3.205,4.244,5.9498,1.2964,2.0917,2.7016,2.6041,4.5284,6.0793,5.8595,5.652,1.0289,0.0001,2.261,5.7247,5.1201,1.883,1.7621,5.8792,6.2523,5.6349,0.2425,3.1484,0.4804,1.3543,0.0969,0.1176,1.3103,4.9941,3.2628,3.297,4.204,2.8374,5.1381,6.6778,2.2614,3.3599,1.5302,4.947,2.2845,6.0073,1.8657,4.1626,2.9696,1.5305,2.9922,2.6455,3.2979,2.7498,3.1011,2.0564,4.3194,1.2789,1.5552,6.344,3.6673,0.227,0.6486,0.7766,3.0627,1.5784,2.0316,5.3704,1.0574,1.2078,1.7375,2.3139,5.8794,0.6577,0.8599,0.5989,0.4851,4.0156,5.0595,5.0162,0.6568,0.8325,0.7543,1.4007,5.1505,2.7844,0.4081,3.5364,0.8635,3.8573,0.7617,5.6045,0.0004,0.002,0.0828,1.6924,1.8704,2.1044,0.5938,0.2454,0.0002,2.2547,0.0016,0.2667,1.1957,4.4968,3.3891,2.4173,4.059,0.115,4.1796,5.8558,0.1503,2.1366,0.3152,2.346,4.7994,2.4882,0.1709,1.0845,4.2092,0.4904,3.9499,4.6488,4.9832,2.9441,1.8792,3.3295,6.8882,0.6327,1.6296,1.216,1.0592,1.1656,0.8998,4.0138,0.6101,2.9218,0.7077,3.0194,0.2859,1.7382,1.9676,0.0569,2.0429,1.2946,5.5301,2.0028,3.0976,0.011,4.6935,3.4149,3.4841,1.1544,1.0391,6.7211,2.1092,2.9461,2.8387,0.3191,4.3021,1.8294,0.6683,1.9866,1.0267,0.2161,5.5318,3.7956,4.3186,1.4717,1.0351,3.8723,3.4355,5.8701,1.6906,3.774,2.8673,4.0775,1.6382,2.1411,5.6147,0.6135,4.4604,0.8527,0.3392,0.3321,0.0002,2.979,3.6165,2.4484,1.8501,0.0007,0.0731,2.8655,3.2604,0.6396,0.6606,4.1067,6.0017,0.0843,1.343,0.8916,5.6812,3.0132,3.4778,0.3884,5.8519,3.1651,1.1382,4.3603,4.5636,0.0891,4.3026,2.6897,7.0016,0.5024,1.0261,1.752,0.9932,1.3365,3.5966,1.8094,0.0428,0.0477,0.1845,0.6953,2.6123,2.6071,0.0752,0.0379,2.826,1.607,2.1118,0.0141,0.029,0.2951,1.6655,3.0023,0.0089,2.5218,2.6246,5.2247,7.0362,0.8043,4.9977,0.2007,1.9226,4.3759,3.0485,3.3053,5.4017,0.3739,5.6279,4.3082,5.2291,5.2602,4.923,3.2292,0.001,2.6592,0.3283,0.3405,0.0002,5.6637,2.8516,3.1607,4.0666,5.2097,1.1145,5.6492,0.6848,5.103,2.7221,3.3751,0.9063,2.4539,1.5205,2.0027,4.8423,1.5443,3.1154,0.3155,0.0315,0.5531,0.7531,0.0001,0.6028,1.4869,2.4034,0.001,3.3502,1.8468,0.6916,0.3783,2.0758,3.2152,1.1201,1.706,1.1158,3.7755,2.008,4.7053,0.1637,2.267,3.3584,5.1782,0.7402,1.6334,5.4873,1.888,1.0611,0.9585,0.0387,0.3939,0.3561,4.6082,4.6521,3.1976,0.1244,4.9372,0.3576,0.1397,4.8185,2.886,5.2146,0.8143,7.623,0.2633,0.0003,0.1099,1.6966,3.6294,3.762,0.1962,0.475,3.476,0.6314,3.0623,5.3794,2.3292,4.2645,3.7475,1.8491,2.2116,0.0008,1.1721,1.8027,2.8763,6.0813,1.6424,1.0846,0.885,2.2504,1.0565,3.7726,5.6729,3.7689,1.8066,1.805,4.1187,3.8113,2.4633,3.1752,2.8285,3.6191,3.8789,0.8743,1.8034,3.5309,1.6412,3.0659,1.2299,0.3958,0.0002,2.7505,0.0016,5.458,5.1089,4.9285,3.453,1.2926,1.0875,0.0179,3.6233,6.3312,0.238,0.0151,0.6952,0.0087,0.0021,0.0005,0.0015,0.0015,0.0001,0.0025,0.0008]}
{"id":1618,"ended":false,"length":625,"gen_text":"While rummaging through a box of arts and crafts you created as a young child, you find a picture you drew. It is titled `` Me and my sister. '' You have never had a sister... your father died in that war and you were not able to bring him home to your mother because he died with them. You did not leave him until the War, and that's why you didn\ufffdt come back until you were 19- years old. So you saw yourself as a great artist and when the war ended he made your drawings and you took him to where he wanted to go and it became easy to reach for new objects or pieces. The problem was you never knew where your mother went and you didn\ufffdt know why her home had turned into a castle. If you did, the problem would come back for you.\"\n\nWhen asked what she did more difficult than being a child, Mr Wilson said, ''I was an excellent school teacher. There were really no problems, no problems that I can recall. As far as I can tell I was an outstanding kid. I have seen things I never thought possible, I have seen things I never thought would happen. I went to the school on the morning of the 20th April to see what was going on and I was amazed to hear it would happen,'' he said. \"I saw the sky, the landscape which was so beautiful, the people around there were so young... So I put on a blue dress, I put on my black skirt, I put on my black panties, I got my boots.\"\n\nIn the end, he took his sister to a picture booth, where she went out into the park and took pictures. Mrs Wilson said she did not think, then and now the picture was taken. In her final analysis, Mrs Wilson had worked with her at the beginning of the war and at the end of the war. She did not think her sister, who grew up in a small house with few windows, would have this type of exposure over a short period of time.\n\nMrs Wilson said she never even saw the last of her sister's pictures for the next half century, but she remembers feeling, through photographs she did take at home, that something was wrong with her sister. ''What was that? I am trying again to find my sister, not be afraid of my sister. The day after the war one of the things I remember most is she sitting in her pajamas with her arms around me. '' I thought, now that the first picture had been taken she could not believe who, and I think I would have laughed it off because someone needed to be told the story. What did her picture look like on that day when she was younger? I mean, she was dressed to my grandmother's specifications. We always kept all of our pictures together. I knew everything that there was to see, everything we needed to know about the war, her life, the wars that were going on. How much was it that we could learn and how much it would help our sister understand the real story of what happened to her life once she had her portrait finished?''","token_len":640,"entropy":[10.9841,4.0532,0.0442,0.1347,3.1473,4.2172,0.3879,10.8043,0.9001,0.1117,6.1013,11.163,4.1832,0.4141,3.6943,1.3297,0.6534,0.4919,2.0584,1.1935,5.5707,5.9202,7.5831,2.842,2.4992,2.3906,7.39,9.5018,12.9452,3.7217,2.0468,4.9203,2.8981,3.076,2.7328,3.344,4.3856,3.6239,1.0038,5.8949,6.7428,6.0631,2.9685,3.2972,1.7315,5.7104,2.8116,1.9562,1.2987,1.7995,3.7269,2.9914,0.0049,4.5964,2.3566,1.2782,2.7107,2.0649,1.9659,3.6981,1.8893,2.4148,4.4074,5.8872,0.6021,1.8622,4.6551,0.3794,5.252,2.7895,2.7201,2.7439,5.2152,3.2749,1.6874,3.5783,2.6265,1.8742,0.6301,3.5876,6.1339,0.0028,3.3148,0.659,2.0149,1.3254,0.7995,3.846,5.1252,5.387,0.0759,0.305,3.3901,1.2491,5.6872,3.5445,0.7683,0.7709,5.0998,2.6889,1.5374,5.3617,3.4921,0.4662,1.0416,4.3714,4.5312,3.4037,3.6908,1.6516,1.5634,3.4907,3.1167,1.4048,6.0126,0.8972,3.9841,0.4356,1.0107,2.1958,4.3393,2.8808,6.5765,1.0807,5.6491,1.8727,5.5515,4.8458,4.3668,5.6034,1.4121,3.365,5.6314,0.9127,2.446,3.1423,1.6355,1.1678,2.7978,4.093,3.219,2.3811,1.3934,1.9437,0.0189,0.0005,0.529,4.2623,3.0523,3.823,3.073,4.1468,0.7672,0.643,4.3884,0.6734,5.0736,0.3282,3.552,1.8152,3.1027,3.7803,0.7483,3.7788,0.7674,4.3444,0.1729,4.8222,1.2184,0.0195,3.9459,3.6207,1.9429,2.3208,3.1357,6.0723,4.569,0.6231,3.9664,0.7656,2.4922,1.5749,5.6771,7.405,1.1046,1.1539,2.727,1.2695,2.7508,3.8512,5.1501,4.4452,0.7958,1.1543,4.6154,1.0646,5.3571,1.8152,1.5332,3.0032,2.2454,1.5386,2.9161,1.294,3.8643,2.53,1.0218,4.8877,2.5943,0.0036,0.903,2.8301,0.6149,2.2547,1.3311,3.4847,2.4102,5.7838,0.8996,0.7618,3.7479,4.2898,4.0864,2.1783,1.9171,1.3617,2.5098,1.8201,2.1499,0.7463,0.5446,0.1949,0.6954,0.7587,0.9368,3.0272,0.5333,0.8469,0.791,4.6409,0.5451,2.4637,2.964,4.3927,2.336,4.6447,0.2428,0.721,4.8694,0.0168,6.0262,3.295,1.9752,1.8341,1.052,0.5146,0.2707,1.6474,1.0615,1.6949,3.1452,2.6188,4.057,3.7475,4.3532,2.8878,7.6306,0.5043,0.2607,0.0574,2.5179,0.9168,3.7426,2.0562,5.791,2.4826,1.2972,5.5256,7.2785,1.0298,2.624,1.2112,1.3697,1.6335,3.628,3.6286,5.877,3.4861,1.2926,4.1925,5.2902,6.0069,0.86,5.6098,2.0498,1.4157,4.6012,2.4674,1.8563,1.8926,2.2278,0.0462,1.957,3.3875,4.7073,0.9997,0.3878,0.5084,0.015,0.503,1.8359,5.3217,0.9573,0.3932,3.8226,1.9831,4.5673,4.6929,0.3211,0.0002,3.113,1.9355,2.979,0.525,1.2894,4.6355,1.4045,4.5409,1.2478,1.9792,5.7066,4.662,2.5074,1.8307,1.2078,4.6926,3.7778,3.8479,0.1068,5.0336,1.375,3.3162,1.5225,1.7941,4.5515,0.4636,1.7451,1.4174,2.9553,0.2209,2.542,6.0217,4.8916,3.6213,0.2381,5.1089,2.6677,1.5828,1.0503,0.8527,4.4557,2.6914,3.7666,5.4823,0.3504,1.51,0.0195,3.4059,5.2513,2.8316,2.2926,5.7316,1.1595,5.9782,0.3723,0.5059,0.4364,1.3687,4.161,0.4218,0.4239,0.3807,0.5886,0.0902,1.8659,1.631,3.9722,0.2218,1.8047,3.2317,1.8174,3.5548,1.279,5.6175,0.016,0.7004,1.4785,2.7967,2.7729,1.8092,4.4645,2.3233,0.6025,0.833,2.2683,4.5868,4.5586,0.0031,5.4463,6.6958,2.1037,4.4428,0.2422,0.1261,0.0044,0.3985,1.1247,0.0003,2.6979,0.0299,1.283,1.0155,3.943,5.4007,2.5828,1.7182,5.7906,1.4014,0.8989,0.8568,1.3165,2.2177,4.9495,1.6817,3.2425,5.1851,1.8883,1.9665,1.8967,0.9539,4.2006,4.1404,4.564,5.4773,4.4559,2.6471,3.8751,2.5812,4.058,1.5435,0.364,0.6235,3.6713,1.2099,1.417,1.6374,0.5086,1.7285,0.3768,1.8032,4.76,2.1211,3.1249,2.0156,1.7663,4.748,4.7993,5.8501,1.3361,1.8125,3.1323,0.3719,1.868,4.5251,5.7764,2.8043,1.2316,3.3745,0.777,1.4565,4.2109,5.2809,1.5749,1.157,0.2881,6.9995,0.5656,1.3976,2.8865,0.7213,3.0191,1.6285,1.9694,3.5243,5.2439,1.4201,2.3951,5.4093,0.1761,0.0993,2.433,0.5682,2.8611,2.3736,1.2675,1.5315,3.5303,2.7463,3.6072,1.6255,5.4968,2.0942,3.4934,6.0534,1.6375,3.5489,0.5937,0.0599,2.8435,3.3451,1.7688,2.6136,6.5761,6.749,2.6031,1.4405,2.7624,1.8985,3.5429,0.709,4.7748,4.6122,0.0715,3.7669,6.4675,6.0425,0.211,2.2194,3.4605,3.1981,2.0436,1.3283,4.9519,2.8029,3.9647,4.0609,2.262,0.0024,4.1203,2.1813,0.8531,3.7761,0.9767,0.8573,5.0882,0.5077,1.9647,4.3902,0.8262,1.7285,1.0594,4.1194,4.7095,5.8234,4.4379,1.2983,2.9005,1.3354,4.7237,5.0383,4.7602,5.1816,1.8286,1.2465,1.7731,2.892,1.6654,1.6885,4.3107,5.1895,2.9933,5.6839,0.1134,0.1776,1.9287,1.6584,2.5174,3.1729,2.3029,0.0946,0.8828,1.6559,1.8247,0.8845,1.7836,5.8014,1.6028,1.0558,2.0491,5.4104,1.9162,1.5843,0.6732,0.023,1.26,5.8386,3.6561,2.8223,2.4487,2.0347,2.372,2.1385,3.5485,3.3032,1.8926,0.5755,3.5644,0.7188,2.0265,3.6594,2.437,4.4079,1.9842,4.6591,2.2686,0.7891,1.8015,1.0074,1.8198,0.3092,4.5388,6.7344,0.682,1.9821,3.7682,4.5947,6.223,1.0391,2.3619]}
{"id":4292,"ended":false,"length":627,"gen_text":"How a Hot Pocket destroyed the world... I couldn't believe the way that somebody would do that. It was amazing.\" -- James Comey, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence\n\nOn the way to the Oval Office\n\nIt took a while for the Russians to find out.\n\nOn June 20, 2013, after days and weeks of speculation over whether Trump directed the incoming Trump National Security Adviser to delete his emails from his personal computer, the United States finally released some information regarding Russia's purported hacking of Trump's emails. There are a ton of reasons for why this would happen -- it's likely that, with time, the Trump campaign would want to use this information against the president's campaign, making sure Hillary Clinton's campaign would have the most effective cyber weapons against her opponents. But for now, it's pretty clear that the new FBI director will be left to decide whether there's a problem with the information, but at least he's not afraid to talk it over with Trump. \"It was a great honor for us to get on that stage and have a good, open conversation about hacking,\" said Comey, when asked about how he would react when he asked him to give the information to the general public. \"What's great about the way it's gone is...there's been no way around it, there's no way around it, there's no way of avoiding it.\" The two days into his job at the agency that Trump took office -- that day, he announced that he's reviewing FBI Director James B. Comey II's firing -- Comey publicly spoke out, writing a letter to Congress stating that he was concerned about their investigation and said \"We believe that there is a significant problem with the integrity of the [FBI] website that is affecting our mission and national security. We are working to resolve this issue fully.\" A day later, Comey tweeted that he was going to work with the FBI director's office to \"come up with a fix to this problem.\"\n\nThat day, the White House announced that, because of Comey's actions at the agency, the FBI would \"consider appropriate disciplinary action against any individual or department.\" The president issued an executive order, which is standard for Trump: \"The department or agency in which this activity or any matter alleged is alleged shall immediately suspend all activities, personnel and facilities that are associated with the FBI's foreign intelligence system.\" Even less unusual, Comey gave additional reason to think that he was in some way doing it for Trump: The FBI's top deputy, James B. Comey Jr., is on leave after he was terminated for allegedly violating the Hatch Act, a federal law forbidding a deputy director or executive from acting against a fellow official (except as necessary to protect career secrets). The decision of Comey's office to move forward with investigations was apparently part of a larger effort to take down Trump from office, and no doubt there will be more in the future.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump fires Comey under Obama, after Russia hacked Election-Day emails\n\nThe Clinton witch hunt: After years of investigation, Trump just can't shake the pain\n\nTop Justice Department official: 'You can trust your president.'","token_len":640,"entropy":[4.3152,8.941,6.3675,13.331,1.933,2.6364,4.4165,4.13,4.9974,0.001,2.2304,3.472,4.0508,2.5609,6.4675,2.2969,2.6831,1.0545,1.0822,2.4496,1.0869,3.6006,1.7537,5.0237,5.1251,5.1093,1.151,4.671,2.1771,0.0811,0.12,0.0927,0.8939,0.0006,4.392,1.997,5.6715,0.5788,1.2446,2.8207,0.0126,1.9914,0.0001,4.9477,2.547,2.5728,2.1961,0.6991,1.9182,4.8251,0.1159,3.5663,2.1959,2.7275,1.8553,0.0001,3.0606,3.2891,3.1837,0.1199,2.8873,0.081,4.1369,6.0074,3.9955,1.3092,0.1391,3.1441,3.9917,1.2018,1.9384,6.2547,1.1301,5.6025,2.6604,2.0808,0.5747,0.7922,1.2073,4.8907,2.5765,2.6275,1.7372,0.8059,0.6384,1.7187,0.2549,1.5085,5.3882,0.0244,5.209,3.3834,3.6612,2.9107,3.8568,4.0232,0.2742,5.6956,1.6504,0.7679,3.0725,0.8827,2.8472,0.5268,5.9325,2.789,2.8786,4.9506,0.0423,3.4087,1.609,3.4565,1.5046,3.3699,2.8156,3.1031,2.3489,1.3204,3.826,0.9618,3.9222,4.3873,4.5592,0.2659,1.4073,3.1585,1.0589,1.0774,5.0025,0.2466,3.7535,2.335,0.2105,3.09,1.8993,3.0597,2.9089,2.0938,1.8551,5.2352,3.5612,5.6714,0.2177,2.4326,0.8688,2.4443,2.1135,1.9364,2.827,3.0073,4.0426,4.201,1.8883,1.329,4.1218,0.3212,2.6857,3.7664,0.6179,0.0859,1.6566,0.8136,3.6949,0.5846,0.3091,1.2426,5.8083,5.2303,1.5371,3.3318,1.5447,5.541,1.6937,3.3882,1.1145,4.9857,0.8018,2.0434,4.1597,0.8737,1.0571,2.9432,2.5082,4.1475,3.6082,0.4036,1.3796,1.0233,3.3933,5.2563,0.1956,4.158,2.6808,0.9743,0.739,4.1107,0.845,3.3974,2.5976,2.0034,1.5539,3.0285,3.5249,2.2763,2.2226,0.4451,2.7155,5.7078,2.6115,2.8814,1.4757,3.312,1.8188,3.3925,3.4849,4.1971,0.9136,1.5441,5.2735,1.1865,3.0051,0.7072,1.351,4.0159,0.1627,0.9917,3.494,1.2317,2.7527,3.0162,3.3483,1.889,6.3922,3.3439,1.4448,4.4865,1.899,1.9188,0.8124,0.5093,6.3565,0.1492,0.1709,0.4276,4.7285,2.7421,5.0181,0.6654,2.1529,3.4984,2.1547,1.1126,5.3107,0.9587,6.2736,4.9836,0.6092,2.3891,1.996,5.0623,4.32,0.3068,2.169,3.6421,0.2532,1.2439,0.4226,0.2538,0.415,1.3755,1.9037,0.1172,0.2247,0.1084,5.2473,5.4021,0.2322,0.9322,2.9721,5.1902,5.9827,4.7097,1.6589,2.3962,3.7607,0.1102,4.5236,3.0256,3.5375,2.8728,1.7139,4.2518,4.503,3.1232,0.7322,2.017,3.8114,1.0143,0.461,3.9934,5.2516,3.4403,0.8471,0.0807,2.5755,0.0031,0.0,7.7267,0.1335,4.2068,0.6124,0.3375,5.6921,4.6084,1.3851,3.7275,4.6557,1.8992,0.5405,0.4323,3.5407,3.691,0.428,1.0776,2.1301,3.2569,0.9676,6.6101,2.7274,2.259,4.0067,3.1645,4.0312,3.4535,1.2253,1.6967,0.7445,1.5178,3.007,2.6155,1.1275,0.6107,3.9921,0.1739,0.4097,5.898,0.7596,0.7451,6.1513,3.3381,1.8301,3.3136,1.4732,6.0404,1.2682,5.0029,0.0105,2.3395,1.1682,1.7293,1.9108,1.1248,1.325,0.7701,1.1038,5.3667,1.2988,4.6365,1.6824,0.5774,0.0743,1.6851,4.086,1.2697,0.662,1.2092,4.228,0.0745,4.7538,0.6142,0.9407,1.8425,2.6038,3.3327,0.2266,0.7073,1.3573,5.2254,0.3657,0.0193,0.3277,3.6888,1.6291,1.1664,0.5974,0.7179,2.0234,0.0002,4.545,1.9324,0.2449,2.1406,3.5134,0.0012,2.1623,0.4417,3.9203,4.349,0.6138,3.3938,0.0283,2.4065,4.6152,0.152,2.7383,0.1674,1.3107,1.2134,1.269,3.9127,4.397,5.1835,2.6164,0.1473,1.0101,2.3261,0.985,2.1129,6.6105,3.4833,2.0531,2.8835,4.0367,1.6427,0.628,0.006,2.9464,1.7536,3.9747,4.6818,2.4369,3.5889,5.3441,1.2401,1.7586,6.4407,2.5905,0.1092,2.3932,0.108,3.0954,4.3525,2.9984,1.5649,2.7432,6.2052,2.435,2.3226,2.6355,1.7875,1.9568,0.3224,2.0635,2.6941,3.825,1.7003,2.9062,2.6404,1.4964,1.5785,0.0164,1.268,3.992,1.4752,5.7919,0.6585,4.8403,1.9316,5.8144,5.833,3.6858,1.6804,2.2915,5.752,6.2883,5.0453,1.3333,2.5049,0.5303,2.3534,1.7819,3.352,3.7157,0.5207,4.5421,3.7349,3.8584,2.3684,1.8643,2.9985,2.0681,2.1306,4.253,3.1647,0.7053,0.9533,0.3533,0.0023,0.0041,0.5709,0.0331,2.5759,4.6443,2.4254,3.322,2.7196,0.6732,4.9873,1.5168,2.4726,3.93,1.0764,0.6788,0.0047,1.1297,1.2284,1.4786,0.2604,4.3422,0.0018,4.1983,3.5727,0.824,3.7348,4.0744,0.6626,2.3175,4.5613,1.3763,5.6382,1.7625,5.1754,4.999,2.4452,3.1143,0.5241,1.0607,6.5219,3.4823,0.7019,2.2963,4.0025,4.0355,1.8309,1.2402,2.9615,0.7934,4.7672,1.8083,0.1314,5.5058,3.7663,3.8914,4.7825,0.0043,0.8271,1.9579,1.4766,0.6498,5.2221,1.2324,1.5552,3.2997,1.38,1.2708,1.7923,5.9368,2.83,4.5781,2.6408,0.0825,2.1205,4.4404,0.3831,1.8678,0.6057,1.2614,0.0002,5.5548,0.7934,1.1944,0.5899,0.0002,2.3955,3.9724,0.6237,5.0537,5.2376,2.3127,5.4163,4.3614,2.8161,6.4993,5.1804,2.1844,1.5083,0.3075,0.0003,2.5499,5.6797,7.0246,0.0964,1.7692,5.7783,4.108,0.1545,3.6493,0.2871,2.5233,5.9103,3.779,0.0003,3.8018,0.7286,5.3913,0.56,0.0003,5.3671,3.8881,0.1678,1.2027,3.5849,2.6629,3.7412,1.8945,5.7014,3.295,4.1745,3.5201]}
{"id":3476,"ended":false,"length":566,"gen_text":"Sometimes I 'd like to see this city go down in flames... but I'm not that guy,\" said Mayor Domenico Pacheco\n\nPacheco said she would like to continue the fight until she has the final word to move the city forward.\n\nMayor Domenico Pacheco says he is tired of hearing that all his supporters and neighbors have received letters demanding an extension of the city's 10-year waiting list. File photo by Juan Carlos Gonzalez\n\nHe says some have been waiting more than 15 years, but that more than half of those letters have come from residents who said they want to see the city's list of the 10-year waiting list extended.\n\n\"With what appears to be a slow process to get that done, we have some friends who want an extension, but it's really getting started, and unfortunately some are not up to it, so there's a backlog,\" Pacheco said.\n\nThe mayor said the city won't keep getting more letters, but said in any case, \"There needs to be a push on some of the most important things.\n\n\"To me, there's no reason we can't get more help through the various public issues.\"\n\nMayor Pacheco has already started working on other areas of his agenda. He is working on the health care and business taxes.\n\nHe said he wants to make sure that people start making a difference at the municipal level, and he's working with state legislators to get local legislation passed. That includes providing tax credits to the very high risk pool of municipalities, and offering housing vouchers for low income people on low-income housing in the city.\n\nPacheco is proposing a $10 million fund for municipal support for homeless and community agencies that is being put together by the mayor. At this time, that includes $50 million from the Housing Authority of San Diego, $9 million from the Department of Justice's Poverty Prevention and Treatment Unit, $2 million from community programs, $5 million from the San Francisco County Sheriff's Department and more.\n\nHe's also looking for $45 million from San Francisco Parks and Recreation.\n\nPacheco said he's seen a lot of people calling for the city to extend its waiting list by at least 2 years.\n\n\"We don't need to wait 2 years now to see this kind of action,\" he said. \"Our message is this, wait until you see some of these letters coming from someone who knows that they want to see these long-stalled initiatives that need to be pushed through of more cities to get our funding.\"\n\nHe said that if this movement continues all residents can stay together.\n\nPacheco was joined by Councilwoman Marisa Lourd, who represents the area, at the City Council meeting before they take a vote on Wednesday night.\n\n\"We are really in our 60s in the midst of something that is very, very sad,\" he said.\n\n- -

No one expects what the aliens are most interested in buying.\n\n. A convention is organized to show the aliens what earth has to offer. No one expects what the aliens are most interested in buying. Humans exchange goods for money to earn their living.\n\nThis could change once people realize that we are really just exchanging money for money. Our first and most important job before getting married will be to create what he or she wants for life: human-like beings.\n\nA New Family\n\nHow would you like your kids to live if they're the only ones with a family on Earth? It's hard to tell, with so much difference between what we want our kids to do and what we want our family to do. We want them to have a safe, successful future.\n\nThis can change as soon as your parents move away and you realize what your kids think, and there's so much change about your kid's world that you just can't keep it together.\n\nThey might decide that they want a family with their baby or will become part of something new. These changes are what create the future for them, but you can't keep them living where the world might give them. When your kid gets to the point where he decides that he wants to spend more time with his grandma, we will make the relationship strong and happy for him too.\n\nWhen your child is mature enough to start making decisions, that's when they will understand that you want them to enjoy each other like you will. By making these decisions, you create a world that you want them to be happy in.\n\nThat world you're so proud of will evolve from there. This is my hope when my kid is born, we will start moving away from what we think is the future where we might want to live.\n\nThese changes will happen through the relationship between us and our kids. They will continue where we want to go with kids. And it may even include an education for our children.\n\nA Better Family\n\nThe last thing we need to expect from a new generation is that they'll move away and see that they are doing great again. When my 15-year-old daughter is born, we will try to continue what we've been doing with them. We can think about a new family now. We can make their lives better. The future won't be lost forever.\n\nOur family is what it's made of, it's a family of family, it knows that they can accomplish what they want if it's what they want. It makes sense for our family to grow at its own pace and learn the ropes to move towards this future.\n\nBy doing the same things that created our family, children will know that they will accomplish what they want. A better family is one that they can learn the ropes to move towards, and a better life will be one they can live on in the future by doing the same things that created our family, because their lives will be as wonderful as ours.","token_len":641,"entropy":[9.9962,10.5971,9.8636,3.1652,8.2179,0.7149,2.7268,0.4631,7.3617,2.7322,4.3397,9.5925,2.0195,3.1294,1.1496,6.2875,1.9746,6.4835,3.2403,9.6735,3.0807,0.5689,0.0053,0.9426,6.3442,1.5064,5.0422,5.5589,2.2388,0.7786,2.2737,8.6541,1.7059,0.0107,7.5406,0.9288,1.8648,0.0299,8.0514,3.8384,0.4751,0.0036,0.0002,0.0027,0.0015,0.0015,0.0082,0.005,0.0051,0.0018,0.0008,0.0008,0.0015,0.0253,0.001,0.0014,0.0011,0.0013,0.011,0.0025,0.0005,0.0008,0.0027,0.0042,0.0013,4.8886,5.4401,3.6204,2.4928,2.8719,4.2149,4.801,3.3376,1.2244,0.3014,2.9471,0.0002,4.7743,5.7632,4.8851,5.2171,4.2394,1.7776,0.6846,4.2431,1.1746,4.9232,2.1164,5.1917,2.0129,0.3612,2.5937,0.4851,5.4327,5.3797,4.6665,1.7737,0.8574,3.5532,5.6412,4.1488,2.5092,3.3717,0.1474,0.5619,3.7007,5.7109,5.7782,1.1418,0.0044,0.9793,2.4665,2.4591,4.7297,5.3036,4.1078,2.9695,2.8505,0.5545,1.1147,0.0003,3.7834,5.4951,5.4516,1.5299,0.0003,5.2718,2.7129,1.6163,1.0787,1.2351,2.4653,0.0841,2.0254,1.6005,0.9305,3.2326,4.2245,1.3232,0.7281,3.2645,2.2917,2.0025,5.0794,1.0152,0.1661,3.9114,0.8019,2.9346,0.2853,3.2667,2.1014,6.216,1.9122,1.8293,4.2508,0.7533,3.2183,2.509,4.0241,2.142,0.8653,0.0174,2.3074,0.4583,0.1212,0.5856,1.0995,1.4319,3.1629,0.054,0.1887,0.26,3.211,2.3254,1.8884,0.0888,1.867,1.2823,3.9639,1.1545,5.2141,3.1785,1.2525,1.4683,0.0001,3.9468,4.0466,2.254,2.6718,2.7226,0.0031,3.8712,4.7774,4.2981,2.1922,2.5163,1.7075,3.1249,3.7245,1.8925,0.8674,5.7337,3.3261,1.8721,5.6332,0.8399,4.3663,0.0807,4.4424,4.3699,2.9869,4.6038,1.5012,3.3558,2.1895,1.6529,3.6817,1.4016,0.0011,2.8097,2.0379,1.639,0.2809,0.7064,0.0001,5.6434,2.8441,4.6888,1.4861,1.3915,0.8703,2.2166,2.4593,2.257,2.919,5.5436,3.1889,5.5165,4.0719,5.358,0.0513,3.1145,2.7806,0.7788,5.2818,2.3246,2.0111,3.7601,4.4644,1.2764,4.2769,2.3668,2.0246,1.5906,1.7522,3.0764,1.4962,0.361,1.4982,0.7903,5.8921,4.8837,4.0309,3.118,5.3473,4.2244,0.223,2.1116,5.5762,1.9445,2.6103,3.0206,2.6877,2.5573,0.5098,0.2677,1.1313,4.5952,1.3612,0.66,0.4572,0.381,4.4951,2.6272,0.2716,0.2796,0.4919,4.6408,0.8057,4.9082,3.6943,3.7875,3.0713,6.1309,5.242,1.1124,2.4203,1.0269,1.0695,4.9534,0.1409,0.2907,0.0001,3.7987,1.1016,1.7168,1.6771,5.4395,0.2784,0.3726,3.6647,3.1404,0.7792,1.767,4.4175,1.1267,0.2133,2.3861,1.3727,4.6351,0.8853,3.2147,2.517,0.8237,0.0476,5.9037,5.1231,0.1297,5.7224,1.3889,5.6984,1.148,5.8478,2.9138,2.7029,0.8268,0.5398,0.9652,3.7482,0.8658,3.3947,1.4094,2.7908,1.9282,2.036,0.0096,2.189,1.4374,0.375,0.6331,0.4549,0.0001,4.7239,2.9479,5.1833,3.7598,5.0017,1.4328,0.0657,2.0955,5.4721,4.1667,1.4197,0.439,4.7178,1.1712,5.9532,2.3448,3.7667,2.0356,2.6366,1.1212,3.6791,1.9834,3.919,0.9103,3.793,3.9908,2.378,0.0313,3.0917,0.8564,2.2394,0.9892,1.5092,3.303,4.3422,1.0374,4.7393,2.6001,1.0259,1.1122,0.703,0.6772,0.0002,6.0953,1.3175,0.9597,2.7088,4.4279,2.2329,4.719,1.3185,2.7965,0.9573,0.8947,1.2416,0.4659,2.6441,0.7157,4.883,6.8084,0.9535,2.8228,1.7854,0.8019,3.4448,5.1331,1.5694,3.6104,3.7134,4.2074,2.2864,5.7752,4.4402,4.4709,2.5258,1.3232,1.8583,0.7975,0.4229,0.0001,3.7059,3.8659,2.8686,0.4249,0.0001,3.085,4.3199,1.1081,1.2586,1.5043,1.2253,6.6912,1.3984,1.4131,2.1979,2.1667,0.5134,1.3091,1.2171,1.5223,5.7614,0.7063,3.4803,5.4005,2.9782,1.6544,2.3771,4.7606,3.9816,5.8919,0.194,4.1743,2.9324,5.8473,0.1653,0.0429,0.0421,0.0031,0.9884,2.057,1.2885,0.2565,1.6084,0.8528,5.4115,0.2432,4.9627,2.6856,0.4758,2.1512,1.2855,0.0779,2.8374,3.0873,1.0791,1.5309,4.0564,5.6904,0.9442,4.4494,2.4503,2.6551,4.7754,1.9209,1.4539,0.258,3.1242,4.4547,0.9172,0.5535,0.7016,4.8854,3.0758,4.4974,0.0004,0.4354,5.5599,3.3385,0.506,0.5072,0.0001,3.4523,3.1925,1.6938,3.9491,4.2811,2.8215,0.7307,0.2119,2.2441,3.765,0.3556,3.3676,1.36,1.5105,5.2144,1.6908,1.7886,7.3861,2.1592,3.2506,2.2521,5.4531,1.8989,0.3419,0.3365,5.4355,3.3219,1.2988,2.9376,0.5917,0.5089,0.4854,2.4921,4.8182,2.4917,2.1757,2.1444,1.2318,0.2517,3.168,4.572,4.5311,0.5602,0.0266,1.9659,3.7528,3.3475,4.0898,3.3107,4.3019,4.4521,3.7444,2.0754,0.6203,0.3919,0.0001,5.547,2.9934,3.2632,1.1438,1.2283,1.7834,6.3713,1.1838,0.7541,0.4163,6.1012,0.8369,4.1489,0.5309,0.8945,2.7601,5.7256,0.9011,0.2145,0.2496,0.988,4.7412,1.5066,0.4862,1.4903,1.5998,0.7648,4.3772,0.8201,3.6556,3.9931,0.7024,0.1779,0.7774,0.3358,2.1038,1.2893,3.4297,0.3576,2.7427,1.7922,0.9685,2.8099,1.439,0.1518,0.9985,2.3395,3.9616,2.7624,0.7124,7.4554,1.836,1.19,0.4356,0.1198,1.1176,0.9796,0.5524,0.0435,3.4166,4.8601,4.5271,1.9887,0.7804,0.7261,4.3425,4.2817,0.3772,1.0626,0.1937]}
{"id":4253,"ended":true,"length":620,"gen_text":"You're in the process of taking a broken modem back to the store when you're struck by lightning. When you wake up you find you can access the Internet with your mind, the only problem is it's spotty and disconnects constantly.\n\n\"It was only a year ago that I first put the modem back to bed because of serious issues with the modem I was using and when it stopped working I knew I had to re-start everything and change everything on it so it would make everything work right without affecting things after I had reconnected my service.\n\n\"I recently had this problem where I wanted to re-start my modem and the problem was that I have no way to turn On the computer or set up my system. This is where my modem came in for support because since I had a problem with this the computer would not function properly or my router would not know what to do. I asked the router what to do and the router provided this amazing service and my internet service was ready to start from scratch and the router never shut up. As far as I can tell I have not had problems with this issue ever so much during the 5 years I have used the service I have used with this service. I have NEVER had problems from this on a router, not even when I have tried to connect your wireless to your router.\n\n\"Now I want to give you some tips: The first thing you can do with the new modem is to re-install the old one so there are no any issues and your system is fine. Once you do the same thing over and over again with a new modem then you are going to know you have gone from an unstable modem to a reliable modem and your internet is ready to go.\n\n\"You have just got a modem again that is not defective you have a problem with this problem I want you to know my recommendations when changing your modem in the future which is why I gave up trying to fix this problem.

{"id":3099,"ended":true,"length":617,"gen_text":"The year is 2050, Kim Jong Un has died in his sleep with no known children. In desperation, the North Korean Government seeks out his next of kin. They find him nestled away in the heartland of the US, where North Korean officials are actively courting those seeking access to the country to support their own people. In short, the Americans feel sorry for those willing to accept the idea in their time of need. When America's nuclear weapons have been used against North Korea, the North Koreans have returned and begun killing the children.\n\nIt is a very serious problem for American citizens to consider that if these actions were taken in the context of North Korea being a nation of free will (and not of military force ), they could have a very bad effect for the US and possibly the rest of the world. Americans will be exposed for their role in the actions of US agents, agents who can be perceived as acting in military-initiated ways, and are allowed to use such actions to gain what they want without fear of retribution. As part of their continuing violation of constitutional and humanitarian rights, these agents have made some of the most serious mistakes in our history. America's enemies in this case include Russia and China, for not allowing anyone to pursue a peaceful course of action without American involvement.\n\nThe very fact that these actions are being carried out through the use of force by North Korean agents (and not with the consent of Washington, D.C., where Americans live ) means the United States and the West is complicit in the ongoing violation of Constitutional and human rights in this place, even if the perpetrators are American forces.\n\nWhat will happen to this nation's freedoms under attack if these actions are committed? If we don't get them, then our actions will not end up being good enough and their effect will probably be felt by many other U.S. citizens and their governments worldwide.\n\nWhat will happen to our rights under attack if these actions are done in secret and we aren't led by American diplomats (who should be allowed to be present at all times and hear the arguments with no legal authority)? Will these consequences lead to a massive increase in the cost of our wars, or will those wars take place in countries with the most serious threat of armed conflict? What about that North Korean government who wants to re-emerge with an armed group that can attack America's security and economic interests?\n\nWhat should we do with the millions of North Koreans who now live in these countries. They now lack many of the basic basic freedoms that we need. As these young men, they are being forced to live off the cost of a government they fear will become extinct by the time their hands are tied. When faced with these risks of life, they may well choose to stay and hope the government they believe they should serve will be good.\n\nAs these young men and women leave, their lives will also continue to be transformed into a place where their children are educated, they may learn to speak up and fight back - and if they are brought in contact with the American military intelligence services, they may have a more direct role in the civil war.","token_len":642,"entropy":[6.8972,2.5904,6.5226,0.9259,9.4435,1.1797,0.8226,1.5505,6.927,2.8826,2.7268,1.1337,4.8638,2.4787,5.0931,6.9891,1.0399,3.8918,7.2967,0.3925,2.0465,2.3374,1.2558,6.9554,5.6728,5.6192,4.8251,7.2419,3.2128,0.0015,1.2655,3.978,4.2855,1.3028,9.703,0.0341,4.6194,0.4325,1.7669,5.398,3.8827,0.1915,1.0576,5.7936,1.9704,1.5889,5.2632,1.1993,3.5527,2.4303,5.3109,4.0723,0.0064,4.6725,3.4113,5.4212,0.1909,1.5547,1.9138,4.7472,4.7034,0.9438,2.9044,3.7469,0.3965,3.5677,5.4301,0.1356,1.7842,5.8156,5.5486,5.1962,0.0163,3.7352,6.0273,0.035,3.9005,1.5157,4.3141,6.4613,2.2545,5.9887,0.1767,0.3913,0.4002,5.6891,5.8375,1.8049,5.2835,2.0696,3.1642,0.651,3.0796,1.6727,1.7801,0.2159,0.3963,1.6801,2.3055,0.4463,1.5563,5.6226,3.8062,4.9178,5.0113,2.7565,4.4765,1.6236,1.3629,0.0042,3.6462,0.8113,2.4262,4.5544,4.1036,1.7983,1.8257,4.0974,3.4841,2.7318,4.3371,3.2808,4.3388,4.6051,3.6415,2.0086,1.9691,1.7718,1.2062,3.7689,0.0128,3.4194,0.1582,4.8133,1.1736,3.8785,1.1808,5.0194,4.2349,4.6564,2.1787,2.0848,2.9732,4.3835,1.9365,6.1662,2.292,1.9957,2.4059,2.4598,2.108,3.5955,1.6997,4.2955,1.0464,2.0409,1.7803,5.8301,1.6642,2.5655,0.001,0.0486,0.0252,0.2506,5.5347,3.8257,1.9177,4.7524,3.3716,1.9635,3.7474,0.0949,1.6027,3.6789,0.3924,5.0051,4.8984,2.2587,5.5825,3.2159,4.6819,2.1671,5.1204,0.3223,3.9844,1.1519,5.6241,4.2225,5.1015,0.6161,0.3002,2.4935,1.9756,1.5399,4.2373,5.4171,0.1411,3.4709,3.5916,1.5878,1.2322,3.8353,5.9443,0.6088,1.093,3.197,3.5584,0.2474,2.8443,0.5659,3.9627,5.4671,0.0018,2.2009,5.8483,4.4923,0.0331,6.3529,2.7987,4.0871,1.0167,0.258,3.0048,1.0573,2.1963,4.8808,4.4617,1.6412,0.374,0.4745,3.0577,2.0188,1.176,2.8556,1.0594,0.5495,5.3983,1.119,5.6686,3.0408,2.2176,2.3474,2.9541,2.058,1.9626,0.1239,0.6119,5.9098,6.2465,3.9383,5.3596,0.4039,5.3162,2.4614,1.1448,3.5327,0.1561,0.0756,3.4378,5.2495,3.0768,0.3098,0.972,0.0003,1.9842,5.5278,2.1829,0.1581,2.3135,0.5509,0.9815,1.1341,1.5768,0.0029,4.9944,1.1265,2.5573,0.0078,2.1834,1.6787,1.964,2.174,0.7648,3.8637,1.655,1.9947,4.1903,1.1264,2.0458,0.0614,5.508,2.2595,0.835,0.0016,0.0047,2.5509,5.2115,4.178,1.9813,5.3005,3.2879,3.1192,2.1843,0.0047,2.4532,1.5706,5.2462,5.9337,2.6222,0.2578,1.2416,4.141,1.8734,0.0711,5.5209,0.5149,2.9838,0.0142,2.7044,1.8652,6.4694,2.8707,3.8259,1.2395,1.7878,3.8888,0.9348,3.3887,6.9389,0.5311,1.3289,0.0003,4.1243,4.1852,0.8382,1.0636,3.9785,2.9299,2.5328,4.5143,3.4559,6.2238,2.7692,2.4637,0.477,0.3606,3.822,2.778,3.846,2.6794,3.0007,0.0009,4.3511,3.6844,1.0189,2.8945,3.0202,3.6711,0.4466,2.7687,4.5157,3.3973,1.3309,3.5829,3.1693,3.9594,5.9021,4.7555,0.3191,5.2703,0.3787,2.8826,1.6388,2.8916,2.3227,6.9326,0.0022,0.0019,0.0412,0.2689,2.073,2.7737,5.6153,5.2822,0.195,1.1848,0.0003,3.388,1.2449,0.2628,0.4211,1.7601,2.2126,0.3791,0.4332,0.4978,0.9183,0.1528,0.063,4.2172,1.4299,4.9209,1.9755,4.897,4.1002,0.0007,5.8269,0.903,3.1007,4.1255,4.0669,2.4235,4.4956,0.8647,3.1861,0.2215,3.3617,2.974,1.6517,1.5032,0.454,2.7028,5.2442,1.7414,4.6407,5.128,2.4947,3.4615,2.1795,2.5697,3.0554,3.5432,6.1424,4.001,0.2736,2.1922,4.5996,2.499,0.0443,1.4762,3.3039,0.223,2.3088,3.7677,1.407,2.6729,0.2375,3.4096,2.7612,5.267,1.8513,1.5372,4.1676,2.2251,3.5439,1.9845,4.3109,4.5193,1.2795,4.8949,0.1312,0.8018,3.561,2.5508,5.4515,5.5483,0.5321,2.9682,2.471,3.982,0.3431,5.4621,0.4381,5.3894,0.0009,3.0504,3.167,3.1579,5.1331,1.6547,2.503,3.2834,2.4881,2.4115,4.1371,1.6652,3.5601,0.2701,1.1538,1.107,0.0002,2.2438,5.5029,0.9355,0.2976,3.665,1.3638,3.7865,0.1456,2.0666,0.7306,0.6138,5.278,0.3332,0.4442,4.2771,1.1795,5.5702,3.015,5.0649,5.9018,5.8681,1.0262,0.1358,1.0315,2.6772,1.5288,1.279,2.1042,3.5408,2.5502,4.0812,4.9505,4.6505,1.6308,2.6433,0.9183,1.7045,2.6178,2.2837,0.3708,1.181,5.4385,1.3454,4.9208,0.0584,3.6289,4.2009,2.7108,5.06,1.4973,3.8036,4.0235,3.7915,1.162,0.9405,2.8124,6.119,0.4166,0.7946,0.4033,4.9828,5.7736,0.004,2.8071,3.4091,3.5309,4.2686,2.3781,1.5034,3.1232,3.1494,1.4945,0.1919,3.1341,2.2826,3.7437,2.8272,2.47,2.5976,4.3304,2.9097,4.1564,2.9209,1.2661,2.1175,4.806,2.28,1.0499,0.0002,3.4482,3.8527,0.3584,0.1165,2.5422,0.0617,4.2168,2.1851,2.5938,2.5875,0.729,5.3494,5.5264,0.1503,0.7764,4.7814,2.1393,1.9795,4.3676,0.7219,2.7507,2.6831,2.2193,5.244,1.0867,3.3124,2.9429,3.7733,1.1033,3.6991,3.27,1.5042,3.0772,1.9265,6.9769,1.7729,3.5833,0.7978,2.4593,5.7259,4.3599,3.0754,0.0511,1.809,2.6327,2.1702,6.7073,2.8978,0.6315,0.5724,0.6282,3.1905,1.5914,4.2119,3.6019,1.8635,0.34,1.644,5.0743,0.9329,1.7079]}
{"id":841,"ended":false,"length":555,"gen_text":"While investigating the bees vanishing across the globe, the protagonist stumbles upon a truth that could change the shape of reality.\n\nNatalie B. Loy\n\nNatalie B. Loy, Ph.D., was a forensic biologist working in New Zealand for the Department for Conservation that studied the biology of bees as pets and humans. In 2004, she came upon a single hive of bees on a field site. The bees had not yet been released and weren't much better at controlling their nestmates. With her expertise and the beekeeping equipment, the team decided to go with the best of both worlds. To this day, the honeybee community on New Zealand has largely embraced the idea of a hybrid species, with a number of experts including: Michael Zemlinson, Ph.D., a bee keeper in Hawaii living in Washington D.C., and George Mok, Ph.D., who specializes in honeybee ecology. As part of their research, B.L. used artificial light to investigate the relationship of the male female queen with female bees. Using the information in this paper, B.L. hoped to learn some new details about how the neanderthal queen and female honeybees are able to protect their nests and the honeybee population. Additionally, research has revealed that the two species are co-opted by certain species of mammals, insects and reptiles, making it the ideal opportunity to research the relationship between those two life forms and other species. The two eucalypts live as close to each other as possible and communicate with each other like two different groups of tiny little monkeys. It has also been described how the honeybees have a \"double entanglement\" on their male, meaning they are attracted by female bees at the same time, which allows their females to reproduce in a similar way to that of the other bees. The honeybees are able to move to the nests by way of the female bees when they take over during their fertile days. Once the honeybees move to the queen's nest, their egg is laid, forming an entanglement between the female, male and egg until the honeybees hatch. The males then use the female eggs to form a brood with their honeybees. The honeybees do not know what to do with this brood. When their queens leave one of the colonies they are in, and the egg has a female, but the female is male. They then continue mating with the male in a different way, taking care not to kill, sexually attack or kill the female.\n\nRichard A. G. Anderson\n\nRichard A. G.

{"id":3116,"ended":true,"length":628,"gen_text":"A man dies only to find that he goes into a parallel world where he can only move 200m from his place of death. Problem is, he died in a rather busy spot, so he's not the only one. Other people can live in parallel worlds where they live in fear of the other person, like in reality. In this case, I feel sorry for those people who 'wanted' him to save their life, because he is an ordinary 'good guy' who was supposed to 'protect his people and make peace with people he 'doted on'.\n\nWhen I met you at the show it was interesting to talk to your wife, you have a pretty normal personality so I understand your point. You were very patient with her because I thought for certain that she is the only person who was the one to save his life or at least help him. As a scientist you know what you want the audience to come to know about this amazing man and my question can be, who 'do you really want to save?', how do you think there are so many people who want to help him? Can you explain his nature for you.\n\nI found yourself thinking for a while about what sort of character will become this man in a million years like I described. But suddenly I thought that if you were someone like me living in the parallel universe one day you would be like, who will save this great man and so what then will you do? This 'you want to make peace with this amazing person' is something that I think there could be a few more people that do help. The fact is that this 'you don't want to save', this one's a great guy and he is doing something you would want to make peace with, then I guess the more people that will help, so in effect this guy I feel is an important and interesting character, so all in all I hope that your readers will have a great time reading my book. Thank you for your time and we hope that you will enjoy the read.\n\nI don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but with regards to the last part of my life you know we could be friends in the future; at present it was your marriage when I had a divorce and the two of you did very very well. This isn't what I would do in my actual life, but rather if my life was going forward you could ask one question: who will you marry next and if that man would make the world a better place? One thing I really want to say to you is that I'm very surprised that you chose, my wife. I would love to see people who are very nice, I think it was because you were one of the best that would really be a thing, I mean he could be a role model for the younger generations. We should all enjoy spending time together.\n\nWhen we moved to Sweden your children, your wife also was one of those people who used to come together everyday to speak to us and to share stories that no one else in my family heard. I really love your family for being such a wonderful man and I hope they will remember you for that.","token_len":643,"entropy":[7.3022,6.9149,10.6638,4.8881,2.1097,2.0476,1.5693,7.8744,2.9792,1.1897,8.3344,1.808,1.1972,1.3763,3.0696,3.2669,5.4478,8.711,4.9541,1.9588,1.9026,4.1223,0.2081,3.5375,0.765,9.92,0.6732,0.5309,1.618,5.7822,1.9695,1.0295,7.9528,7.8342,5.6577,1.709,1.8782,1.219,2.8826,1.931,4.4332,0.633,0.2383,1.7469,5.3658,1.5515,3.1628,4.1172,1.4022,1.7702,0.166,3.2239,0.6779,3.5424,1.1749,4.8364,0.4357,2.6231,1.7633,0.5852,1.8494,5.2026,2.6455,7.0475,0.8721,3.3634,2.1511,1.3024,0.2248,3.6991,4.3159,5.4477,0.0665,3.7633,1.5092,1.3098,8.3883,5.0135,1.7263,1.1498,5.2912,0.7074,5.7662,2.1705,1.6091,1.0699,2.0244,1.9514,3.0128,3.6461,3.7488,5.2912,3.782,0.5069,0.8105,1.0546,3.3103,4.5125,0.0029,4.3875,2.7436,3.6616,2.4754,4.266,3.0199,4.1972,1.5329,4.4398,3.265,7.0106,3.9693,4.1446,1.0474,1.3365,1.4166,0.0527,4.6978,1.2389,4.5403,5.1241,2.7602,1.2837,4.205,4.8793,0.5027,4.8417,0.7742,3.9888,2.0592,3.8589,3.689,2.1156,4.8358,3.364,1.5537,3.3783,4.3834,2.166,5.9408,1.9091,5.2444,2.121,3.4053,0.9916,3.2156,2.8276,2.4235,5.4973,1.2805,1.2418,4.444,3.1553,3.2781,6.0502,4.3618,0.9582,1.0676,3.534,2.9452,2.583,0.92,0.9495,3.1281,5.4253,1.8864,1.8558,2.2514,3.0565,0.1336,6.1109,1.9881,0.0961,3.4333,0.423,1.2479,4.5477,1.9514,5.883,1.6452,3.501,3.0776,1.5315,2.3017,4.1799,4.9639,0.0183,5.8255,0.2803,1.5042,2.6075,4.8086,4.8104,2.7796,2.1705,5.87,2.2224,7.3964,1.0873,3.1273,3.5612,6.2446,4.4656,0.3283,3.7627,0.5704,0.7895,0.7946,4.3312,0.8858,2.8193,1.093,0.0413,2.0163,5.575,0.8515,3.2055,0.0455,0.9917,0.7659,2.3925,0.272,2.1212,1.3645,0.9188,5.262,0.2979,1.799,6.466,4.94,4.594,2.7271,4.3096,0.4874,0.0001,2.2586,5.9245,4.2363,2.2398,3.1647,0.3455,0.8862,1.1952,2.3838,4.0364,0.0022,4.6137,5.5926,4.7188,3.0336,1.6346,3.487,2.4332,5.975,0.0701,6.5397,2.7284,4.5979,2.0227,4.1416,6.0416,0.8875,3.4117,2.2094,3.0739,2.0201,3.1485,5.1699,2.2879,1.2791,6.8881,0.4773,2.6046,1.915,2.0435,6.5927,0.3737,1.793,0.8544,1.7449,3.2949,2.5165,4.8682,4.7058,1.5965,2.6275,5.1681,0.6318,2.2038,4.8524,3.5672,4.5607,3.2106,1.1735,0.4772,0.6243,4.6051,4.9672,5.1375,3.6762,0.3526,4.8069,0.3377,0.271,3.1634,4.8769,2.5847,0.5792,2.726,3.0286,1.0856,0.9879,2.4463,4.411,4.7001,0.252,1.4649,4.6906,4.0197,1.2082,2.4648,4.5016,4.4635,3.1096,3.9002,3.0086,1.5289,0.6976,3.1067,2.8782,0.4358,4.1744,0.0013,0.27,0.0976,0.759,3.6493,2.7629,4.7441,4.0534,2.5085,4.3604,1.5196,1.3714,1.7244,2.0087,4.1984,3.1427,4.5606,2.4365,2.4888,0.5399,3.345,0.9553,0.0222,2.5439,5.8219,2.2706,3.7714,3.2949,4.2429,1.9316,1.4118,2.9874,0.8969,2.2136,5.9934,4.4704,6.6013,3.104,3.34,5.948,3.6723,1.4913,3.6334,3.2371,4.1056,3.7589,0.4649,2.7743,2.5903,5.8681,4.0821,0.0131,1.0092,2.7079,0.5302,4.0643,4.182,0.7055,3.7106,0.6115,2.3664,0.4386,2.6227,2.8691,1.3482,0.9176,3.4852,0.014,1.1785,1.8407,0.167,1.4799,4.3645,1.4017,0.8701,0.8473,1.1731,1.1489,2.098,3.964,0.8219,0.4094,0.0001,3.3177,4.2606,0.0009,2.181,0.082,2.8766,2.773,0.0439,3.7923,1.2967,1.0417,5.7534,4.4308,0.0158,1.3502,5.3595,2.3856,0.9692,2.3427,4.7304,3.089,3.3963,4.6867,5.5487,2.8033,4.7061,3.2351,1.426,0.2112,6.349,5.1728,4.7979,3.1321,4.2434,4.5927,5.5589,5.0057,1.2259,3.4356,1.8521,3.7875,1.4539,3.8302,3.1403,0.3115,0.6374,4.6462,4.3308,4.4104,1.1876,1.6901,4.6128,4.5444,0.0005,4.5463,1.1981,2.139,3.6896,2.1496,1.6158,5.7887,0.1821,0.9928,0.9767,4.2264,3.6366,3.6106,2.1781,1.4901,3.4674,4.9214,2.9899,1.7793,3.8264,5.6887,1.0276,1.9826,2.9437,2.2065,2.2252,2.7766,1.9813,2.624,3.3406,2.959,3.9667,3.152,3.5134,2.9161,3.9795,0.4921,0.0713,0.0171,1.6155,5.3739,1.8895,1.0081,3.9538,1.7629,0.1525,1.537,1.3462,0.4396,0.6338,0.5385,1.0987,3.0219,1.885,5.5534,1.0142,1.0404,3.6623,6.2681,5.4707,1.2665,2.5743,1.2197,3.556,2.2971,0.4005,2.0099,5.6984,2.5563,1.6179,3.2784,3.549,2.0782,3.4925,2.2876,2.4098,3.7492,3.227,1.3822,2.0981,4.4095,0.0766,0.5421,3.0003,4.9184,5.2186,5.2765,2.9447,1.7233,5.4631,3.23,2.5474,3.4626,4.9822,3.3504,1.9393,1.5944,5.4715,0.019,1.1509,2.7957,3.7093,2.2951,1.11,4.303,4.2033,1.7942,3.9654,6.0375,0.3419,0.1211,1.8058,0.8837,0.0001,4.8525,2.4153,4.7659,0.7877,4.7277,6.2783,5.3049,3.5137,2.7416,1.3066,5.0916,3.8687,4.4125,0.0642,2.023,1.3964,0.7927,5.4843,0.1173,3.3192,6.3781,5.4307,2.3781,5.4802,0.8731,2.2913,2.0464,2.4183,3.4798,1.682,3.7517,6.3412,0.2857,0.5944,3.278,3.4866,1.6554,4.7956,0.5838,2.2315,3.4522,2.8771,2.2758,3.1556,4.55,2.8194,2.3304,0.3912,2.7625,6.2821,0.8538,1.1882,1.8547,3.843,1.1269,4.3772,0.4596,1.4049,1.8541,0.7545]}

If you are still a monster, the only question you will have to ask is if you want to have new souls placed in the new body, or if there will be no souls that exist for you.","token_len":644,"entropy":[7.4122,3.3744,5.6537,2.7433,6.7749,1.161,2.0363,1.2303,5.0077,1.2856,0.0162,3.2924,5.2431,2.5418,2.2884,3.2844,0.1416,5.2981,2.0332,6.3326,0.029,7.6437,5.2509,1.0224,7.4702,5.8842,1.2041,4.5244,8.3706,8.4187,3.254,0.0871,8.0567,9.1305,0.0826,2.3077,3.2471,2.4814,3.4625,7.2001,2.0543,8.2801,5.5048,5.2692,0.8543,1.5892,0.0089,8.0898,2.651,4.1052,0.3744,0.0118,6.2194,0.4359,1.7108,1.0034,4.0958,1.4955,2.8986,2.0161,3.2731,3.663,1.5145,3.7487,2.5677,1.031,2.1599,1.8582,0.7499,3.5453,3.1541,5.1317,3.8032,1.6566,0.3408,3.2788,1.0413,3.5838,0.7121,3.4559,2.6723,5.0906,2.9904,5.978,4.8577,0.2634,1.5357,1.4014,5.2391,0.4997,1.8029,0.4651,0.6081,0.0372,4.9801,4.2963,1.6922,0.8034,0.0002,6.8841,1.7115,0.0168,0.0135,0.0027,0.4562,0.0322,0.0028,1.9353,1.2833,1.8177,1.0805,0.8654,0.0745,0.0815,0.0431,0.1215,0.0052,0.0834,0.1635,0.1689,3.7233,1.3325,5.2958,3.2713,2.2464,1.0922,4.8005,1.8838,1.2067,1.6445,1.8841,1.0549,0.3028,3.7617,2.9531,1.7158,0.8951,3.7056,4.0771,1.2131,3.0572,1.5884,0.0445,0.5067,2.9975,2.6306,2.646,0.2754,4.2571,1.4743,0.8619,1.4214,2.2873,0.4726,6.5844,0.293,0.5773,0.3656,1.8829,2.3011,2.8516,0.7764,0.2289,0.0123,0.3394,0.3536,1.5303,0.221,0.0874,0.1424,0.1476,0.1542,0.0413,7.2905,1.5909,0.8326,2.4428,1.086,1.1486,7.2065,0.1208,4.0666,0.1099,3.6654,2.5177,1.626,0.1607,0.4668,0.6676,0.0002,2.9742,3.4268,2.1284,2.12,5.067,3.021,6.4384,2.7645,1.9615,3.8611,3.477,4.0033,6.0472,0.6431,0.0202,0.3457,3.2858,1.8224,2.2982,0.9405,4.3653,0.9325,4.6414,4.1171,3.1553,1.0658,0.3722,0.8513,0.2776,4.4309,2.4619,1.6036,3.3723,5.6345,2.9664,3.4865,5.5197,1.2027,0.7333,0.0002,5.4137,0.0613,0.0083,0.0138,0.0069,0.0151,0.0016,0.0354,0.0014,0.0116,0.0057,0.0005,0.0045,0.0054,0.0546,0.0012,0.0043,0.0081,0.0179,0.0004,0.0014,0.0006,0.0012,0.0037,0.0008,0.0006,0.0015,0.0021,0.002,0.0013,0.0046,0.002,0.0007,0.0177,0.0006,3.2967,3.082,3.867,2.3144,1.6995,4.6168,0.2675,5.6544,0.5935,2.5069,0.0655,0.6452,0.6824,2.9469,0.3382,4.1417,2.0489,1.8553,2.702,4.8166,5.2523,1.0359,0.9357,0.0002,5.7454,3.1479,0.6801,1.177,0.0235,0.1628,2.5561,0.0889,1.0417,0.741,0.0937,0.2096,0.2611,0.0362,0.0191,0.6426,1.6266,0.0111,0.2017,0.0586,0.1763,0.0066,0.4437,0.0375,0.0093,0.0065,8.9602,0.5947,0.1451,0.0453,0.0023,0.0106,0.9526,0.0012,0.0647,0.003,7.8063,7.0654,0.4298,3.0516,0.176,4.9618,1.1519,4.1266,0.7441,1.1628,0.5084,0.8593,0.222,4.4218,4.1718,4.0726,4.6713,0.8288,5.401,7.068,2.6285,3.3712,3.4404,1.8151,5.9566,6.3931,0.0902,0.3621,1.0423,0.9464,2.7743,1.6502,3.9728,2.6711,1.3575,2.4016,1.8187,5.696,0.0206,0.0279,0.3773,4.7978,6.4335,0.5207,0.5795,5.097,1.4517,2.8081,0.051,1.7587,0.4225,0.5944,0.6949,0.5748,7.6,5.7034,0.8742,3.7311,2.3101,2.9437,0.0112,1.9837,0.9142,1.9701,7.0528,3.3822,0.0556,0.2738,1.4398,0.0133,0.9289,4.2026,0.8199,1.756,2.2157,1.2298,2.8872,2.0714,2.9582,0.9995,0.4496,0.6074,0.0002,5.2775,1.1045,0.0129,0.2098,0.0038,0.0131,0.005,0.0015,0.0318,0.0026,0.0602,0.0283,0.002,0.009,0.0026,0.0082,0.0006,0.009,0.0173,0.1128,0.0328,0.0005,0.0019,0.0003,0.0579,0.0022,0.001,0.0037,0.0272,0.0003,0.0008,0.0012,0.0018,0.0004,0.0026,0.0017,0.0012,1.2587,0.0818,1.4682,0.3597,0.3945,0.2715,0.1463,0.1501,0.6151,0.1753,0.3096,0.1743,0.0461,0.0028,0.033,0.0675,2.0855,3.6171,5.1921,1.0557,4.5523,3.1529,2.7549,1.9258,3.3035,4.8929,3.5242,1.5595,0.0002,4.635,5.0584,4.2269,3.2073,1.6256,5.7063,1.0099,5.9414,1.1081,4.9916,0.159,5.2987,3.4508,5.8433,2.3632,1.3471,1.1824,0.0004,5.6568,2.795,4.4212,3.2057,1.1611,5.2153,6.2157,1.0017,4.4771,1.3492,2.2046,1.5631,5.1317,0.5827,3.7752,0.488,2.9988,0.6019,2.5035,2.8873,1.4891,2.5403,2.3583,0.8354,3.7021,0.5315,4.3935,2.0054,8.8152,2.3428,0.7603,1.1387,0.0003,3.4335,0.1707,2.3401,0.1678,2.7817,2.4197,0.0016,3.165,0.2253,2.5527,2.7098,4.7016,1.344,2.3609,3.7184,2.5523,1.3635,1.1561,0.0003,2.8141,0.7205,1.5636,2.3625,0.0445,5.8017,1.4011,3.921,5.1323,5.3008,5.3233,0.8732,4.0708,2.5512,3.3119,0.821,2.3969,1.1151,3.5236,2.8171,5.6692,0.9241,3.5298,1.861,6.3802,2.1681,1.8478,1.2399,0.7878,0.8159,2.3243,0.0027,0.0097,4.115,0.0547,0.0022,0.7542,0.8005,0.0004,5.6684,2.3862,4.8223,0.0362,5.2429,2.5619,0.476,0.0003,4.517,5.3606,2.5594,2.2723,3.3042,3.1575,0.3395,3.8063,0.5508,0.8371,1.7396,2.4894,0.3927,2.4854,2.6045,4.1866,4.0957,1.2628,4.775,2.98,4.8131,1.8778,1.9986,0.7087,0.5067,0.4539,0.5115,2.417,0.9329,1.4534,0.2915,3.5751,5.1991,0.3646,4.9437,1.2434,1.988,1.6583,0.3465,2.1636,0.5716,0.1961,2.767,1.9191,0.0612,3.112,1.6864,4.5554,4.0133,2.622,0.8769,1.0488]}
{"id":240,"ended":false,"length":627,"gen_text":"You are walking down a dark hallway in your home, getting ready for bed. The only speck of light is coming from the porch light through the peephole in your front door. Suddenly, the light slides to dark. You feel your feet slip beneath the covers to look at the ceiling. Slowly you turn away because of the heat. The second person is sitting across from you. Your legs are in the air, your ankles are on the floor, you are running up and down the stairs. In all this time, the light is just setting up your face and your arms. You are feeling so weak that you need to start crying. But your body won't stop until it will stop so that you will stop crying and you will be normal again. Your body is looking for a good smile. Then your heart starts beating very fast and you want your boyfriends smile. As a result, your boyfriends smile has to stay on her face like this.\n\nThis moment can be considered when your parents, your best friend, your best teacher and everyone, think that you are not healthy. You are a child, so you are afraid for your life. Your good friend, the good teacher and the best teacher of your life. You are in a good mood like this. Your whole life is starting your journey to full healthy. Your whole life is going to give you great joy. It is also good so you will never run out of hope but you do have to put on so much effort to go forward and become stronger, too. And this is the same so that you will start to look even more happy as you find your boyfriends smile.\n\nAfter this you will notice that your body is becoming less depressed. If you are not happy, then then you can stop taking the light and you will finally be happier.\n\nBut if your body is tired, then it is not happy. It is getting used to your new life! So, just before you begin to take the light you need time to recover. But you will not sleep at night. You will have to think about it and move on. And you may even begin to feel that you could be happy. But when your body begins to feel that tired from taking the light, then the feeling of happiness and relaxation will have been too painful for you.\n\nFinally, you will feel that you are in no hurry to grow up and start your life in your heart. On your right hand, just then on the other hand, on the left hand your whole face looks so happy : \"Now I'm taking the light with me, my wife is happy with me too, and this is my big moment. I want my boyfriends smile too.\" So that you will never feel so tired from taking the light : \"Now after my big time mood it's all just natural.\"\n\nBy doing the same steps that your father and your mother tried and failed to do this time, your whole life will now look more happy. This is the beauty of the miracle of living healthy and happy in a way no other person could in the history of Earth.\n\nHappy, Healthy, Healthy in a Love Life","token_len":644,"entropy":[3.8828,7.6104,2.0837,1.3536,3.5229,2.5928,2.4847,2.9626,3.5971,1.3064,6.5504,1.7346,1.2604,2.8955,0.6704,2.7899,4.3454,12.026,0.0292,0.6613,0.5707,1.6266,3.1822,0.358,1.2229,6.2442,4.7708,6.9251,0.4969,8.5152,0.1233,0.0481,1.6044,1.2408,2.9561,0.379,0.2863,4.8303,0.6823,1.8519,2.1288,8.6698,3.3219,7.484,2.7712,1.8428,2.7249,1.7393,3.4343,4.5884,4.2707,1.7514,2.6834,4.5199,4.092,1.7485,0.5535,1.7006,0.5615,5.4463,2.34,3.9628,3.9592,6.8664,2.0353,0.4419,4.5264,1.0116,2.1067,6.0167,5.3848,2.6761,3.3079,4.199,0.2597,0.0188,1.0234,3.2662,3.0253,0.734,4.127,1.2231,1.8979,1.5113,1.6595,4.4574,0.5488,2.8024,0.3453,0.5986,0.9459,2.443,0.9911,5.0537,4.2762,0.5969,0.0298,0.8229,1.0077,0.6313,4.758,4.7128,3.0542,0.6264,0.8102,2.2954,1.6439,1.5528,3.9998,5.5844,2.6634,2.1299,4.4474,1.723,1.4736,3.9541,1.075,1.5044,1.7639,4.0706,3.0298,3.9253,2.6493,0.4852,4.3359,0.5146,4.5565,2.9623,0.4465,3.7498,3.2135,2.852,5.3338,0.0019,1.8342,3.0255,1.7311,4.5537,1.7003,6.8146,2.0955,0.608,1.7746,3.33,0.2275,2.4046,1.898,0.2686,2.4177,6.079,0.9314,0.1451,2.9196,1.8006,1.505,5.8908,2.5111,2.0129,3.812,5.107,1.053,4.6993,3.1887,2.7626,2.0986,0.8606,4.9482,1.0199,1.6812,0.8439,4.2633,3.8635,5.962,4.5237,3.3552,1.3048,4.9192,4.3292,1.3631,0.3825,1.9074,1.5678,0.2464,0.8215,5.0214,3.4574,5.064,1.8238,5.7248,0.1654,4.3143,2.2856,0.7658,3.6622,0.1438,3.796,4.4221,4.6363,0.898,4.2405,4.8409,1.6137,6.6555,4.2078,2.2592,3.583,0.4818,0.5893,0.6168,0.8979,2.5646,2.6707,4.9536,4.9124,5.2094,1.3349,0.5794,0.4725,3.1217,4.339,1.031,2.1199,1.2615,3.6855,3.6072,2.592,3.6742,1.2126,1.726,4.5334,3.5743,0.4286,1.5904,0.5593,2.72,6.1148,1.5801,1.4576,2.726,3.0445,0.286,2.1181,1.0401,2.8825,0.4731,3.1772,0.3565,0.8046,3.0052,1.7624,0.9117,3.7611,1.5965,2.9712,0.5495,6.2234,0.7785,0.6018,2.3249,5.2429,1.8933,1.1361,5.5274,6.7065,3.8985,2.0575,5.5531,3.2197,0.993,2.3769,3.0464,0.4174,0.3737,2.0902,0.3167,5.6127,0.1236,4.5303,2.0274,0.8108,3.1943,0.6695,5.003,3.6819,5.5262,1.4084,1.9845,2.6552,4.9222,0.2635,0.1712,4.8165,5.5574,1.1748,5.3039,2.2491,1.2669,4.9832,2.5869,4.1629,0.2724,2.126,1.1968,3.82,5.552,2.2194,3.7887,4.524,3.7627,5.236,0.1398,3.8073,2.5882,0.5968,1.8002,4.3479,5.6092,1.2101,0.4066,0.8864,5.122,1.0203,3.9908,5.2145,1.6118,3.5592,4.0347,0.831,5.4693,1.4846,4.469,0.3519,0.2436,0.8114,0.927,0.0003,4.2813,1.936,3.7081,1.1257,4.8755,0.5796,1.0598,1.4277,0.6777,3.8332,3.9027,5.849,0.8226,4.7913,0.444,1.9612,2.5122,3.1261,0.9636,2.2814,5.8241,0.6031,3.0629,3.576,5.0881,2.5852,5.6991,1.3797,2.4965,0.5374,5.0332,1.5107,4.5408,0.3602,2.0505,0.0002,3.9884,2.3198,1.7011,1.1354,0.4753,5.4996,0.8097,0.3349,2.2907,0.9699,1.4016,2.7016,0.516,2.3284,0.4024,4.3828,4.0163,0.0729,3.1063,2.8476,2.183,6.183,3.3582,2.1356,4.4359,4.8258,0.5908,4.1754,0.8541,3.2824,0.5023,0.1224,3.1376,3.1301,7.1696,0.1997,4.4479,1.2798,3.6354,2.1227,1.5539,1.698,6.0243,3.2526,0.418,1.1879,0.9818,0.3558,3.0641,0.3174,4.1861,0.7171,2.4133,1.9424,5.6006,0.6922,0.5911,3.1487,1.7937,4.072,2.8251,5.0384,0.1245,1.509,3.3689,0.6664,5.401,2.0103,2.8151,1.6814,1.6718,3.6492,2.2314,0.4809,4.0677,0.0617,1.4429,2.8763,4.9523,4.8351,1.9423,0.0916,0.0283,0.8078,0.9006,3.5111,2.9678,1.222,1.4877,3.2715,4.522,0.6662,4.9805,3.7362,3.1256,5.9357,1.5512,0.1339,0.7968,1.3089,0.0002,5.4318,0.298,1.297,0.8308,2.2914,0.875,0.6017,1.0775,3.3436,5.3829,2.4023,0.6584,5.5663,0.7915,1.8417,2.6248,2.2381,1.3891,3.8804,2.6451,5.1231,0.5818,6.6192,1.9163,5.5153,0.9647,1.3065,5.5537,5.6939,4.5625,1.6162,2.0699,0.2708,0.3157,1.8707,0.9823,1.5383,0.2318,4.2996,4.1481,4.8216,3.6544,2.8951,1.6573,10.4212,3.447,4.9822,1.425,2.7119,6.081,0.5593,0.1473,4.3097,0.183,1.9376,2.7317,5.5082,1.5022,2.0057,3.2975,0.3589,2.8111,1.7132,1.7468,4.8231,0.5874,1.5958,4.4928,2.8421,2.0892,1.1447,2.0523,2.8294,1.4075,0.1742,0.1691,1.5146,1.5062,3.3743,3.7612,0.8502,1.2083,3.7796,1.6026,2.8356,2.5076,3.0286,0.2664,0.0562,0.0278,3.6224,0.2726,1.7227,6.5262,2.9041,1.8681,3.8615,5.6687,5.2013,1.2574,3.7297,3.3042,5.7549,2.8017,1.068,0.0003,5.795,3.9254,2.9192,1.9118,3.3305,3.3597,1.8229,3.5583,2.276,0.9521,2.248,4.802,3.1312,1.4249,0.6878,0.5958,5.8294,0.8308,0.543,2.1495,2.193,1.0429,0.3939,4.999,3.2824,3.4429,1.8902,0.9013,3.8933,0.8139,1.4939,5.0772,0.1461,2.06,3.8738,0.7837,4.3012,4.5944,1.697,1.4631,3.1561,2.3568,3.5659,5.6441,1.0647,2.1332,2.0997,5.7148,1.1105,2.4032,0.008,5.3755,0.6875,0.7893,0.0004,5.0849,3.2086,2.8403,0.7502,2.0515,4.6445,0.6773,3.8868,2.1409]}
{"id":3990,"ended":true,"length":648,"gen_text":"Your party has found the Legendary Sword That Can Slay the Demon King. The problem is that the only one who actually knows how to wield swords is your cleric, who only took like a summer course in Swords to boost their GPA or something. So instead of learning that sword for practice, just ask them to show up to spar for ten minutes or so. After you spend the whole class with the Knight, you get to train him, and as your students complete other training with those two classes, you can do some training before they graduate and go on to join them. The Knight and the cleric might have to compete for a living, but they were actually the teachers for this class that taught us how to use the Sword of The Fallen. To this day, I still never knew they had it in their hands. Anyway... I was the student of a pretty terrible mage, so I was asked what kind of things I could do to get into school. There was some talk about whether or not I can beat her in the school, and the Mage asked what kind of training, and there was a discussion about how much better my grades would be without some of the training. So I said good enough, and she said \"You're really good, so you know how to teach. Now sit down and do it quickly\". That was really interesting. I didn't know where the Mage might even be. When I finished, which was two days into the fight, there was no other training that had been done so quickly in the Mage class. So after I found out my name was Sage, I spent a lot of time wondering. Was the game about how to play the Game of Thrones, or were you just a regular student of my school? It turns out that it's actually my first game as a teacher. In my final class, after I realized that this game was playing on my PlayStation One, I found myself in the middle of the lesson. I didn't even know what my class was about. The instructor suggested I read the game on my PlayStation because it was a simple game. The course was actually designed for people who can only play one game, so this student wanted to know how to play it. I said \"yeah, it was pretty short,\" and he played it for the first three hours and gave me a little bit of advice. So that's when my class came out. But if you can put a little extra time in your life, your students should be able to actually think about a real game now. It's kind of hard to teach a system that people want to play. As a teacher, you should teach them as you need them to teach it for you, because once you teach anything, then it's difficult to keep your students in good condition and comfortable for more than a few hours at a time. In the end, my students just made a great teacher. And I hope that my students learn much from me, and that they continue to play real life games, playing real games that are a part of the game learning experience that no one else makes. It's really cool how there are many real games out there, even if you don't know that much about them.","token_len":646,"entropy":[7.3564,2.9044,5.8449,2.2539,10.5972,4.9834,8.9462,3.1607,6.7769,1.6853,4.3613,1.5369,1.3132,2.8516,7.2306,0.4556,1.0753,1.7913,4.6056,3.2261,1.1115,5.0343,2.5905,1.3553,0.0756,1.9434,8.121,0.5497,4.5941,7.3181,1.8583,1.9836,4.2889,6.7566,9.9363,2.1101,8.0123,6.2893,1.1911,6.4965,4.609,16.1458,2.99,9.6294,6.1523,1.8808,0.5186,2.4966,4.1689,0.2624,3.5369,4.6913,1.6404,4.3409,5.8546,0.4412,4.8797,4.3173,3.3307,0.4342,3.7505,1.2837,2.1278,4.473,3.9046,5.1674,0.3964,2.91,1.1829,0.9951,4.6129,2.3623,6.428,2.4603,2.6214,4.2026,2.7351,2.3574,5.3865,1.1706,1.2168,3.1707,0.8658,4.2076,2.9645,2.9328,1.3948,4.9003,3.9237,5.1243,5.4527,6.38,3.6842,4.2723,6.6657,3.3877,3.4994,0.3351,0.7554,2.0824,4.5935,2.6278,3.991,5.0918,2.8847,4.3486,2.9324,3.6827,1.9481,0.2945,4.0714,4.3919,0.9195,3.0924,2.4588,4.2909,1.377,4.8936,5.7654,2.3202,2.7427,4.951,1.4482,1.7796,5.1296,0.8769,0.4138,1.911,6.1133,4.0696,3.3119,6.7006,2.6659,3.1554,1.6732,4.2769,2.0395,2.6291,1.2652,0.0438,1.7896,1.5814,1.485,1.2712,5.3685,4.6923,1.4676,5.4292,4.6368,0.1649,0.2215,1.4143,2.161,4.9676,5.1569,3.9233,1.91,2.5852,1.5597,1.0158,1.8529,0.8433,4.7181,4.011,2.4196,3.489,4.3206,4.9482,2.5277,2.8928,5.1804,5.2972,4.2707,1.9093,1.9629,0.6515,2.2923,5.0709,5.6199,2.3158,0.0046,5.7316,1.1494,1.3144,0.9635,1.0796,2.3595,3.3147,6.0325,0.6732,5.0517,1.1333,3.882,4.2955,0.8867,4.817,0.6446,0.0007,0.837,5.1959,5.2114,3.1041,2.7719,2.3887,5.3922,1.9212,1.2792,3.1814,4.2832,3.5022,3.0494,1.4913,0.0038,3.0412,5.227,0.7166,5.4831,0.3619,1.27,3.3629,0.4011,1.3921,2.6277,3.1128,2.7024,3.5156,1.0601,0.1198,3.6292,5.8119,2.0484,0.7062,2.2147,0.9164,2.5157,0.8248,2.5118,5.4386,4.1517,0.8673,0.2894,2.3973,1.3037,3.4381,3.2268,1.9272,4.3375,1.1908,1.3121,2.769,1.7344,4.132,0.964,0.1385,4.0306,3.5266,3.5656,5.0702,0.5978,0.7899,2.8373,2.7452,6.4292,4.118,3.7976,1.1559,3.5568,3.0701,1.1689,1.4235,3.3558,0.0007,1.393,4.4123,2.6159,3.5046,6.1568,4.6644,1.2039,2.2397,4.846,0.6856,3.7011,2.0725,7.47,1.1064,5.4381,1.2382,4.5633,1.0463,4.9006,0.2655,4.5501,0.2976,2.5138,4.3556,5.7261,2.6358,3.738,1.8844,0.9342,4.1762,1.3302,3.0862,1.5947,5.1025,1.4996,0.5044,1.8307,3.8139,1.9106,5.7618,0.3148,3.3248,3.5009,0.2281,5.0457,0.8422,0.3963,4.9629,2.0626,2.1384,0.0333,0.1085,4.2952,4.1301,4.0536,2.8585,6.2549,3.653,3.9403,1.5507,4.4061,1.6972,5.3447,0.6691,0.6052,2.0539,0.385,3.4458,1.8831,0.9897,2.533,3.7034,1.4934,1.1668,4.2729,1.882,0.6629,3.3103,3.7941,0.0026,0.6794,3.5019,1.8475,2.6481,4.2795,3.0281,2.7292,3.8101,0.449,2.0076,1.0181,3.949,2.4628,5.3846,2.5453,0.574,4.1221,1.4344,5.2155,1.1785,4.3028,2.5123,0.6577,5.648,2.5259,0.4481,5.2338,6.4291,0.3344,0.2451,3.7641,2.0211,2.7553,1.4253,1.1783,0.028,1.8701,5.8099,1.7972,1.0438,3.303,0.0005,2.3553,0.8199,1.235,3.3824,3.1422,0.2739,0.9704,1.2919,3.11,2.9786,5.4665,1.7097,5.207,1.6857,2.4448,3.8914,0.6219,2.2397,4.5494,1.6605,0.8862,2.458,5.7977,1.0499,1.6444,3.1307,6.177,1.2277,4.389,4.465,1.8162,3.7198,0.5099,4.4913,3.663,0.9637,2.1471,0.5377,2.6661,1.2429,4.6805,4.8781,4.6735,0.2397,3.2158,1.2721,0.2571,0.44,1.7389,0.8925,1.3763,3.3991,1.0358,4.2287,0.5213,2.9293,4.6649,2.9223,5.3833,3.3872,0.3316,1.1877,5.1511,0.7077,0.7099,3.5383,1.2793,4.4008,1.882,2.5181,4.619,0.2505,1.1685,3.6418,2.454,0.2135,1.2883,0.7887,3.225,3.121,0.949,0.9112,3.4436,2.741,3.4872,1.9735,0.5461,5.0151,4.6737,0.3965,3.4876,6.1569,2.2813,2.168,4.1307,0.7627,2.1141,2.9607,2.1796,0.584,4.5825,4.2872,4.3085,1.2163,0.3383,0.0016,5.1434,5.7644,0.9278,3.904,4.6753,0.7559,6.1717,0.54,3.0,1.0227,3.5981,0.001,3.427,0.3652,2.8699,1.807,5.3885,1.5431,4.6402,4.8611,0.1252,0.8552,1.4056,4.5949,1.5026,0.96,0.2354,1.5186,3.3386,3.2786,3.0217,4.354,2.4586,4.493,1.0865,0.1389,4.4822,1.8778,4.9542,1.4679,1.6755,3.5219,4.4453,0.4428,1.7962,6.4674,0.5359,4.9935,1.7558,0.9145,5.7085,0.2244,2.7289,2.7111,0.3742,2.4729,5.3664,4.2826,3.1958,5.2493,3.0255,4.9265,0.0759,0.5956,0.8279,0.7916,2.7587,0.0525,0.0145,0.1095,3.8846,1.7971,0.5824,0.0962,3.1794,1.0255,4.0138,4.6985,2.3925,2.7492,1.7349,0.838,3.2384,1.6567,2.5779,1.0741,3.158,0.8733,2.8794,4.1134,2.1484,2.3739,2.2912,1.7922,1.0135,0.9105,3.6205,0.1815,3.4235,6.2731,3.1024,0.7823,2.7203,6.269,1.3222,0.8263,2.1828,2.0919,4.3513,2.0155,0.0056,1.8987,3.0784,4.7279,1.2996,3.0058,6.1706,0.604,0.7783,4.5221,0.3894,3.4848,0.473,2.2426,2.7464,2.7511,5.2144,0.8958,3.7289,3.8958,2.0029,0.8461,0.0067,1.2426,4.2577,1.1998,1.5552,1.0816,0.0007,1.4928,4.3363,2.1564,0.1064,0.361,0.2615]}
{"id":3497,"ended":false,"length":573,"gen_text":"Somebody getting catfished by a moth?\n\nIt was only a year ago that I wrote about the possibility of a bee-killing virus with a bee larva. I knew that the possibility for an infection in nature was not new \u2013 before the discovery of an infectious agent in bees \u2013 but was something of a mystery after I had found the answer.\n\nIt is a very serious problem for many species of human that can easily cause serious harm in the wild. We have been so affected by air pollution that many people who were exposed to air pollutants have had very bad health issues. A recent study in our small Danish city Aarhus found an increase in serious illnesses by nearly 40%, a large increase by 80% in the incidence of stroke, cancer and many more ailments including cardiovascular disease. There are also the serious health problems and long-term effects of exposure to pesticides and metals in our household and everyday foods, such as coffee and tea. The use of pesticides in our environment may contribute greatly to these issues.\n\nWhile the scientific community is not yet ready to endorse this concept, experts have shown that a bee-killing virus (Ebola) can cause serious health problems. When the virus invades the central nervous system, the cells may then start producing toxic waste. At the same time, the virus can enter the lymph nodes, developing into several different diseases that can affect the body and brain. For example, as Ebola progresses, it can even infect the heart and lungs.\n\nThere is no known mechanism for this effect, if it is even present and can cause serious harm.\n\nThe scientists in Germany and Denmark are now pursuing an alternative theory that is more comprehensive and in the long-term possible. They have developed a strategy that provides solutions to the diseases that may be introduced to our environment by Ebola by reducing exposure to chemicals. The goal is to ensure that the environmental damage caused when Ebola is ingested is contained during the first year of life, so that the risk of developing acute toxic diseases from an Ebola infection is fully reduced.\n\nThey have applied a strategy based on the work of the Dutch researchers, which includes working on prevention and treatment of Ebola-contaminated foods. They believe that by modifying food particles and avoiding the chemical emissions, it will help to protect the public against Ebola-induced damage. Furthermore, by preventing E, it will protect plants from the diseases that people inhale from pesticides.\n\nIf the scientists take a different approach, that of using chemicals and not chemicals, they may soon see an increase in the number of infections over the next few years.\n\nIn summary, the Ebola virus is a promising mechanism for making sure that the global population continues to

{"id":581,"ended":false,"length":599,"gen_text":"A new study has suggested that only 8.2 % of the human genome is functional. Now, the lone human with 100 % functionality reveals themselves...\n\nA new study has suggested that only 8.2 % of the human genome is functional.\n\nThis seems like a dramatic increase across animal genera, suggesting that humans have probably not fully evolved the mechanisms required to have such powerful machinery. This is due to the relatively low proportion of our genome actually belonging to our ancestors in the first half of this century.\n\nThe findings, however, were surprising in the context of some of the most complex genes in the animal kingdom:\n\nSeveral of these genes have been identified on a genome-wide basis as belonging to a single gene. This gene is found on 98% of the genes in the animal, making it one of four genes that have been identified as belonging to the evolutionary tree. In recent years, this has been confirmed by a new study by Stephen D. LeCouteur, using a technique called DNA sequencing to scan the DNA of 20 different human genes.\n\nThey found that the human genome was also enriched for a wide variety of protein and cell types. These included proteins found in the blood and muscle, but also very low frequency proteins (which are responsible for pain and obesity ). It also also contained two genes that are present in different parts of the genome, while one gene is present in the brain, and another genes is found in the liver.\n\nThe surprising finding in this study was that most genes in the mouse and human genome overlap with one another, and are therefore extremely similar to one another. And when compared with the large number of human genes present in the human genome, the genetic differences are so large that they could easily be explained away simply by chance.\n\nThe research is a first in a long line of studies on the role of the human genome in human development. However, the research also raises further questions about the relationship between the two. In particular, it could be said that only a very large number of people, if any, will have an evolutionary history comparable to that of their own ancestors.\n\nIf this is true, the current work will be of greater significance if scientists can identify what role genes play in determining our evolutionary potential. But if one can identify these very similar genes in one's own family, should we at all risk think that a gene has evolved where it is likely to be more important than any other aspect of life?\n\nThe authors' research was conducted by Stephen D.

{"id":359,"ended":false,"length":549,"gen_text":"SatChat : Do you outline or just start writing?\n\nNordic : Yes.\n\nNordic : I think it's because of the idea that writing for a group should never be the way for everyone to start their work.\n\nNordic : In order to maintain consistency within the community, you have to keep sure that when the community wants to go away, they will have a good chance of succeeding. This can give you a great source for new membership or have a more natural sense of community cohesion.\n\nNordic : I think because I have a lot of hard work to do with this project the fact that we want to do this now has nothing to do with the future.\n\nNordic : Yes, I agree with the idea that we have a great sense of community cohesion, and the fact that what we're doing, as well as the work we have now, has a really long-term impact.\n\nNordic : It does allow for a great sense of community. A way for everyone to have a good experience with one another.\n\nNordic : And I think that we already started the process to give the community some sense of what it will look like in the future now.\n\nNordic : At the moment there are a number of community projects out there that focus on solving problems of communication at scale. At the same time, that's always been our passion.\n\nNordic : Of course we will try to implement these projects in our daily lives, but if necessary, we will create a platform where anyone can join on our forums, as well as on our IRC channels at \/r\/dexicanism\n\nNordic : I have a lot of work to do before release.\n\nNordic : So what can we expect from the first release of the project?\n\nNordic : All of the releases are going to be hosted by you for a period of time, so that's why, right now! We are at a point where the number of people joining \/r\/dexicanism are dwindling, we are having a hard time getting the full group of contributors ready to start their projects. That is certainly the issue now for us!\n\nNordic : Yes we will be looking into making more feature improvements, but more than that we are trying to introduce additional features. This will be something that some of you might not be aware of, that will allow us to work on more features in the coming weeks.\n\nNordic : We want our project to be able to show a very good amount of

You 'll leave that in the newspaper to find something else to write about!\n\n'The other day when I walked into the bookstore and looked down the aisle and saw the job listing, I cried,\" says Sommers.'Then after that, we saw you again before.' [See the entire interview report.]\n\n\u2014 The second interview, she says, \"is not about you. It is about the new book you have been waiting for. It will leave you with questions. You must ask them. How do I get a job in the bookstore. After the third interview, you realize this job is more than it seems. You 'll leave that in the newspaper to find something else to write about!\n\n\u2014 When asked why she didn't make the changes, she explains that she'misspoke.'' She says there are so many issues surrounding the business, such as the books being sold at the counter. She says there may be a difference in market position in which the book will sell for $15.\n\n\u2014 At one point, Sommers says, there were three managers whom she didn't know, one of whom came from her previous jobs. (She had already worked at Macy's.)\n\n\u2014 She 'wants money. If she can provide for her family, she will work hard and always make it in this world. If she can live as a mom and child, she will look forward to this world and will work hard and always make it in the very world she comes from.\n\n\u2014 At the interview, she says you're so nice. Tell her I want to know more. She laughs, then says, 'I've written your book for me,' \" is the response. \" No. 'She will tell you how she did for myself and you will not hear what she said after the interview.'' [See the entire interview report.]\n\n\u2014 She adds, \"People will tell me I did good for society, but it was not the truth at all... I made some mistakes and tried to correct them too! I am trying again.\" [See the entire interview report.]\n\n\"When The Times called me, one of the first questions that I asked myself was what has changed on the world's most famous city.

{"id":4774,"ended":false,"length":593,"gen_text":"A story which tells a first person account of how that character died, and how one of its creators is killed by the Joker. The story takes place in Gotham City when Gotham is ruled by a group of evil ninjas known as the Bane's. The story describes Batman's early days using drugs, and his days as a gangster; later Batman is arrested and is sentenced to life.\n\nIn the second and third pages where he is arrested and sentenced to life, he is given new powers, such as The Dark Knight Rises (for The Dark Knight Rises) and he becomes Batman. In the first page where he is saved with a gun from Batman's hands, he is placed in the Batcave to save him.\n\nIn the first and second pages where he tells the story about Batman, he is brought to the crime world and tortured by Bruce Wayne. He ends up being given an extra life force and killed by Bruce who tried to save his life.\n\nIn Issue 1 he was part of a team of heroes called the Avengers who fought for the survival of humanity. After escaping from captivity, the heroes decide to give Batman everything they had to survive. The story goes to one of the heroes, who, when the two escape, decides to start a new life.\n\nAfter their escape, Batman leaves the Avengers, and starts to pursue the Joker. He meets the Joker at Arkham Asylum in Batman: Arkham Asylum that ends as Batfleck: Batman Begins.\n\nAfter this one episode Batman is taken down by the Joker, Batman saves the Joker from the Joker, then uses his powers to end his reign on Gotham and free the world.\n\n\nLive Action TV\n\nMusic\n\nThe band the Black Bunnies used to rock this trope is the Kill-A-Wanna-Go-Backers. A large army of masked Black Bunnies attacked during the Gotham riots where the band went and attacked The Joker, who took some of them, but was able to contain the whole group by beating them with a stick until the one remaining member was dead.\n\nThere is also the famous song that's recorded by The Black Bunnies, \"If you have seen my life, you know that I'm one of the most tragic people I've ever killed.\" The lyrics make the world turn after that: One of I really want to kill you but I'm not scared.

{"id":2853,"ended":true,"length":619,"gen_text":"It was an open and shut case, except for one alarming detail...the trial judge ruled that in the absence of any criminal charges, the defendant could not be held in solitary confinement. In the absence of criminal charges, the defendant could be held in solitary confinement.\n\nThis could change once Judge Yellows begins his formal review of the sentencing schedule after his hearing. He may also see other evidence, such as what he has learned about his life and relationship with his wife and children, that might provide him with an understanding of the defendant's behavior.\n\n\"I am very sad for Mr. Doe and my family,\" says the court clerk, James A. Cramer, who is represented by Michael Zemlian, former head of the Texas Civil Liberties Union, which represents some prisoners in the U.S. and abroad who were held in solitary and are appealing what they call the abuse, and not punishment. \"But the judge's decision on sentence... is not the end of it. His decision may decide the difference in any number of ways.\"\n\nBoyle spent some time in a prison last fall after the sentencing and met with members of his own law firm, where the judge said one of the jurors, who was also the prosecutor on the case, now had \"tremendous interest\" in the case. The judge also said that he is pleased that the case's prosecution had begun over a two-week window. The two jurors are also due to be represented by the firm, which will pay out-of-pocket costs of $50,000, if necessary, including attorney fees. The judge also said he was pleased with their commitment and said \"there is time at my disposal to present a complete report upon the matter.\"\n\nEven though this may not go away anytime soon, the government may still be reluctant to release those prisoners, because there will not be any evidence of their abuse. There is little question that with the release of hundreds of detainees, many of them men who have left the country, thousands of their own children will follow.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department's 2011 report, the United States has more than 2,100 prisoners in solitary confinement, more than any other country in the world. But the fact is, the detention facilities are far different from the facilities built for prisoners in the West, and the prisoners may now continue living with the authorities in solitary rather than in a community environment with families, friends and community groups.\n\nFor people who are currently living in solitary confinement, solitary confinement does not create an expectation that they will never be able to do any good without it. And the government may take a different approach when it comes to keeping prisoners in solitary, by taking what the State Department called \"unnecessary actions\" into account in sentencing guidelines. A report released last fall concluded that \"the imposition of new minimum sentences, new mandatory terms and new detention facilities have become more problematic in the United States than in any other industrialized nation.\"\n\nThis is perhaps also true in areas where there have been no recent improvements (including North Korea, the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay is less spacious than it would be in other countries and has \"no effect on our general approach\").","token_len":653,"entropy":[3.677,3.5527,4.8417,4.1443,4.4536,1.826,1.5412,5.9754,0.7402,1.4613,10.2121,2.1209,5.5774,2.7543,6.6197,1.45,3.7642,0.4374,5.1885,1.9177,3.41,0.0055,2.1973,4.3082,2.0674,0.6283,1.3526,2.5282,1.8623,0.9391,1.1311,2.3561,2.097,4.7513,0.0128,1.3778,3.2025,2.4425,0.6789,0.0073,1.8571,0.1239,0.1462,1.0492,0.5771,0.365,0.8758,0.9046,0.3416,1.1102,0.1406,1.6367,1.8471,0.0095,3.4078,5.5962,5.0863,4.473,4.3548,5.955,4.3841,2.0403,4.6231,2.3132,5.4933,1.839,0.3897,0.5747,4.5881,3.4511,6.457,2.2189,3.4911,1.2431,3.2598,2.9411,2.292,5.5477,4.1525,5.1304,2.8753,1.3367,0.0015,4.4056,2.1397,3.1261,2.155,1.0756,3.8043,3.9669,2.0341,5.4659,0.2449,0.9875,1.5937,1.6406,0.8928,0.575,1.0983,2.4842,4.0975,4.203,0.349,2.5213,3.2171,0.2351,1.3144,4.3812,0.0318,4.024,0.9192,0.5337,0.0002,2.9925,1.6298,2.6954,2.3554,4.7636,3.3331,3.0215,0.006,5.5119,1.7089,2.5246,0.2536,0.8166,3.4415,3.3256,4.3049,2.4729,1.3858,5.4045,3.9648,0.1614,4.8929,3.9271,1.1225,0.7799,2.1034,5.0666,0.0258,5.207,5.0871,4.6631,2.9365,1.4045,1.4578,4.8404,3.0893,0.0735,0.2989,4.5049,4.8339,2.4498,0.2498,2.0801,2.4201,1.3245,3.9509,5.0211,1.6271,1.1339,4.1526,0.0004,0.0015,0.1286,3.1861,1.6186,1.6444,2.1929,2.4961,0.4954,0.2504,5.7549,3.1387,5.1732,6.0863,1.3521,2.8845,0.8663,5.2247,3.8409,3.0506,5.7568,3.9717,0.6224,0.5575,3.1111,2.9881,2.8845,2.2274,1.4955,4.0292,5.7966,5.9634,3.6751,2.3319,3.1241,1.1322,0.1131,1.5011,0.9808,4.5854,1.0718,4.478,5.8315,2.4376,5.7661,2.8755,5.4802,3.564,0.0047,1.7029,0.8479,0.1436,0.0002,5.4163,5.499,6.18,4.6093,0.3396,0.8336,3.3578,3.1097,5.684,2.7767,3.3349,3.1853,4.3608,2.8224,5.1187,0.3326,5.126,0.0053,1.0671,3.5808,5.3223,0.2387,1.2318,3.807,3.4412,2.7459,2.2909,6.6222,0.5891,0.6941,5.2778,2.2058,2.4406,1.7158,2.9514,3.9426,3.3448,3.4635,0.2181,0.1231,0.0846,6.2165,2.6188,2.8035,5.1146,1.1377,0.0038,0.0261,4.9353,0.748,0.0186,1.0583,0.1653,0.3469,2.5414,1.0984,2.0205,1.0269,1.3336,2.0983,3.3518,3.6899,1.181,1.1841,2.3725,4.7567,4.3908,2.3396,4.5887,6.0278,1.568,4.2868,0.0399,1.9579,4.681,1.8036,3.0453,4.9266,1.8958,2.7562,3.6024,5.6818,0.3407,1.786,3.6014,0.1477,2.471,4.0944,1.7984,1.2178,2.7205,3.0953,4.2824,5.8101,0.0055,0.0021,1.1669,1.8478,2.2976,1.6818,3.5024,0.0604,0.0065,2.3759,4.2342,2.5691,1.0254,5.3408,1.8821,0.6308,0.7789,3.1482,1.584,1.4325,1.0137,1.4285,2.2609,1.3011,1.5883,4.8261,4.9861,3.5242,3.3776,3.7667,2.9311,0.9295,5.895,5.4668,4.6189,0.6924,0.8108,5.3426,2.1393,4.8168,2.4686,6.3975,0.9302,3.7205,0.7828,0.1908,0.0002,5.3439,1.9936,3.8534,4.6241,1.5463,4.961,2.4025,2.0691,0.0051,0.0542,1.3905,5.1327,3.3535,1.7199,2.1302,4.6745,0.0296,3.1258,4.6044,3.2828,2.6346,3.2322,3.5356,3.8189,3.5626,0.056,1.636,3.472,1.3884,2.6426,2.4461,0.8519,4.7306,1.1198,3.8603,3.5982,0.2514,6.1034,1.257,2.1696,0.177,4.742,0.0769,5.0322,0.6188,3.559,0.2975,1.2897,3.6016,1.818,1.2514,5.5296,1.1425,2.1569,1.6784,6.3251,0.4735,3.9894,4.369,0.7838,1.4507,5.1734,1.0894,0.9882,0.0002,5.1986,0.006,1.2286,3.426,0.0105,1.2107,5.1794,1.3766,0.8368,1.9176,3.5026,0.0157,1.651,3.268,0.614,2.6976,0.285,2.8062,1.8067,1.267,0.8603,0.1266,1.2529,3.2779,0.0323,2.0633,0.0446,0.3543,1.1466,0.0283,0.1073,0.3527,3.5557,1.8012,5.5048,2.3001,1.5626,1.7768,5.5968,3.1175,1.3712,3.2226,4.0256,0.9589,1.5723,2.4561,6.3856,2.1016,2.6627,1.3599,1.3498,4.7617,1.7914,1.8192,1.9769,4.5011,3.4539,6.2784,4.746,4.3509,2.0939,1.9488,3.9675,2.1667,2.0944,4.9525,0.0032,1.6118,1.5302,3.7031,5.0661,3.9697,5.2929,1.891,1.0745,0.7173,3.7778,3.1279,0.3204,0.4843,0.0002,4.2464,5.3029,0.9819,1.6774,4.6101,3.0643,0.6657,0.7402,1.0768,0.3562,3.6273,0.4303,3.979,0.1971,4.4945,2.6438,4.5896,1.7862,0.4386,0.1826,2.1864,0.9426,1.7977,0.0051,3.526,3.2979,3.0812,5.924,1.468,0.4342,3.4475,2.5447,2.0965,1.9508,4.9997,2.3897,1.9396,0.613,2.6395,0.509,0.1427,0.0111,4.3715,2.0254,1.0288,0.5816,1.9338,3.6988,4.7189,5.1762,2.5663,5.4488,0.3741,2.1517,0.565,4.5124,1.6881,3.685,0.6628,3.0228,0.1396,2.3576,1.7487,3.4172,0.6359,4.9608,4.01,1.5768,1.2983,3.056,5.4445,0.1026,1.9702,2.0297,5.5026,0.0458,4.7809,4.9856,1.8521,2.589,4.76,3.0613,5.8533,1.075,1.5327,4.3,3.3191,2.7714,4.6038,2.602,4.4388,1.9456,1.3376,1.2549,0.0039,1.4938,1.2037,1.123,0.0539,2.8991,1.2227,0.6595,0.3538,0.0002,4.107,1.5786,4.9145,5.5049,2.3572,1.9816,6.18,1.026,2.6745,2.7239,0.1177,3.0602,3.6,3.9461,7.0094,3.7882,4.428,0.5173,0.8968,3.4927,4.2579,2.06,1.1331,0.5063,0.037,3.8338,5.0385,5.3286,0.6567,1.1255,3.5127,0.5884,1.0966,3.2479,0.8566,3.0534,2.5969,6.1559,1.8831,5.1796,0.3243,3.9002,5.7895,4.9087,3.9889]}
{"id":4321,"ended":false,"length":602,"gen_text":"Google decides to become evil.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean that those people are doing something bad to them; because in other words, they have chosen the latter course.\n\nSo, to understand the difference, we have to consider the following situation:\n\n\"You and four of your friends all live in one place. Where do you go? How much do you eat? How much air do you breathe? How much is the air your body contains? As we eat you are so tired that your muscles ache. How much have you eaten on a good day?\"\n\nSo, with this simple definition, what we want to do is: we want to make a choice: if one of you has eaten five thousand calories, or if the other three are eating a hundred thousand calories, or what if the weight you give up will change, and there is someone who can get rid of all these calories, so we choose the other three.\n\nBut what if the difference in these factors is that when one of you eats 50,000 calories, or one of you can eat 2,000, you can eat 2 cups of cereal, or one of you can eat 50,000 calories, so on, with only these factors affecting your own weight, what is the alternative?\n\nThere are two possible paths.\n\nOne is where the other alternative has no positive consequences. In other words, as you find more important food that you will enjoy, it will come out less harmful and delicious. And when you start to become addicted to eating, then you can stop taking it for granted.\n\nWe need to take a long walk through each and every step of our diet in order to better understand why we choose what we think is the better choice.\n\nThe other option is to make one choice for myself and everyone I work with; or perhaps I just have an unshakable desire to eat. And that may be good for you for a while.\n\nIn any case, if you want to follow a diet that works for me, then you can follow it. In any case, I am trying to do the best you can with what I have found: a diet that does good for one's body. If you want to follow the best of what I have now and continue to follow it to the next level, you can take it.\n\nAnd if you want to follow my approach to my diet, then it is time to make a choice. I want you.\n\nYou see, that's good, and so far, I have managed to reach my goal.\n\nYou are my friend, all right?\n\nSo, I invite you to continue to improve your diet and follow my diet.\n\nA little

{"id":2674,"ended":true,"length":605,"gen_text":"You've finally managed to build it -- a machine that sends messages to the past. You power it up and immediately begin getting message from your future self. You 'll see that it is true to what you wrote. You know what it means because it's all connected and working together. You have created a 'computer that listens to what it sees.' When you'maintain it's ability to send messages, you 'll get better and better at it.\n\nIt is a computer that listens to where it sees. Because of it, it's the program that sends the messages. The person with the computer is your future self and the message you have delivered to them.\n\nBut what does that mean with your future self? Is that an actual computer or a machine with a computer?\n\nYes, computers are the computer with the most parts of your life possible and are controlled by people that really 'want to know and communicate with what they see. They can't control you using your's mind. They have control so much that the program won't work and they can't stop you when they need you and when they feel confident. They have a set of machines that they run so that they can 'feel you doing it for them.' The machines they own give the best service to the people which will 'tune them' to your best will.\n\nThey 'll just shut it down when the 'couple is done with the work'. That's how you 'll do it. The two are doing this together.\n\nWhat will happen with this one computer will only be your future self knowing when you 'empleted your tasks and sent it back to the machine. He will continue to do their job and this machine won't know at all. That's all their's true story. I am telling this story with the help of an 'a man who will be your future self so you 'll know the story of what you 'll done.\n\nYou 'll never even know what it means to be an 'a man who makes things work. If your future self is not your future self at all, then what the hell does it mean?\n\nIt's how you 'll do it. We 'll be friends. He can put his foot up and he'm done things so that he will remember you. We 'll all be friends after that... I really want him to remember us. We 'll be friends. We will all be friends. I would even say it is this dream to be an 'a man who keeps things run and they 'll stay good together and we 'll all care about our families. One day he'll say to my 'fellow human and we 'll all cry about that. It's true because we 'll never know what we 'll done.\n\nBut he did ask how does he keep it running so that no one will judge us. That is how he did the one day when he'made a decision. That he did it because it's the dream of one person who 'wished to follow in his footsteps and never stop... He wanted us to 'keep things going'and no one would put them to good use.","token_len":654,"entropy":[5.5189,6.1249,4.2264,0.0612,4.5764,3.7131,7.5706,3.6406,5.9501,0.5989,7.5742,3.0928,1.2142,1.7877,8.5704,1.9355,3.2105,9.6907,0.7124,1.5449,1.7104,7.1407,4.0309,5.3091,6.5643,2.9894,1.851,4.1542,2.3279,0.6018,2.6099,8.3351,5.4679,3.7611,2.8239,2.1451,2.8836,5.6805,3.8429,2.3597,0.5655,4.0601,1.8083,1.7817,3.1676,1.8723,1.8211,1.1245,6.0733,1.5652,1.3766,3.831,5.0075,2.7381,5.3194,1.4693,0.704,1.8061,2.8751,5.0716,0.9835,4.4682,5.3936,2.0986,4.3812,0.8208,2.6734,3.1845,1.9885,1.5183,4.6834,0.7112,8.2427,22.8702,2.0647,3.0353,5.558,0.0983,3.148,0.6901,1.2918,1.3399,2.7653,1.5657,3.0133,5.0414,2.2723,0.247,0.6255,0.8663,0.9137,2.5539,0.0252,3.4916,2.088,2.1522,3.7295,0.3488,2.8442,0.1709,5.76,1.2404,1.1049,1.9979,5.8113,1.7419,3.2229,1.0242,1.2202,2.2747,3.424,6.5388,0.4308,2.9151,2.1471,0.9083,0.904,3.1401,4.7379,4.1547,0.5581,2.099,2.1974,4.2079,0.804,0.0411,2.7391,2.251,3.5987,1.4559,3.9891,4.29,1.221,1.7706,0.884,1.2807,0.0001,4.1871,2.7736,2.4416,1.378,0.4368,6.3247,2.6281,0.743,0.0857,0.2318,3.9959,1.8025,4.4101,3.5078,2.2319,2.6154,1.2585,2.8916,3.7579,1.1568,2.4455,1.954,1.2848,0.0001,3.4268,0.6499,6.0812,1.0455,3.1116,3.2094,4.077,0.5981,3.5228,5.2443,2.0193,1.8563,1.944,6.2418,3.1348,3.7617,5.3157,0.3665,4.3486,3.2413,5.4667,6.4348,4.0125,0.5687,2.0312,4.6089,4.5605,0.9338,6.4532,0.6484,0.7721,1.4156,1.4077,3.4587,1.7261,2.7513,1.8156,6.8202,1.889,10.3354,3.5808,0.9451,1.2113,3.2954,1.9212,6.6853,3.6688,0.9501,3.8013,4.8322,4.8666,0.0026,2.028,3.1795,2.0378,1.5086,0.203,4.1278,0.7523,4.0779,1.5823,3.2061,1.8154,3.5162,2.9129,0.4885,4.8298,6.2339,2.0871,1.934,2.3425,2.5668,5.239,0.2922,6.2191,0.6903,1.8762,5.0499,4.1223,1.3515,0.8977,0.5094,2.954,4.4016,4.2061,5.8017,2.1981,2.7517,0.0647,0.8524,3.5422,2.7,2.9042,4.9189,5.4601,3.4813,4.9168,3.9781,0.7094,1.5897,1.7241,7.4101,3.9445,3.4857,5.2163,1.0155,3.3696,2.6578,0.995,1.8871,3.8559,5.7677,0.5308,0.7624,0.0002,3.1618,4.304,2.9173,5.1306,4.3973,2.2,0.2385,1.7675,2.9698,3.981,5.4918,3.5656,3.0885,2.9223,1.4336,2.2108,2.8048,4.7688,2.882,0.7235,2.2904,1.8372,1.8005,1.8717,4.1738,0.7933,0.9714,2.6062,5.2539,2.5414,3.9098,4.0885,1.4789,0.8876,1.8529,0.0001,3.3429,4.0443,1.5619,2.959,3.4748,4.936,2.8302,5.3353,5.4142,1.2051,3.0348,0.8416,0.0269,3.9219,4.2826,0.9684,1.6167,5.7972,5.6875,2.1634,3.7946,1.7198,3.4793,1.7299,1.7744,0.5854,1.7456,2.9142,1.0033,6.1775,1.4497,5.2519,0.4958,2.3284,5.3333,1.8549,1.4621,5.0831,2.1251,3.8091,0.002,3.489,6.1349,0.2422,1.2861,3.8651,0.7847,3.7594,5.761,8.632,3.115,4.9146,0.5374,4.9658,4.016,4.3167,2.254,0.6893,3.2818,2.0184,3.2531,0.0459,4.2812,3.2237,6.0124,4.5821,1.2907,3.9255,2.7571,3.5122,0.2916,0.0594,6.2681,1.6454,4.1025,0.0104,1.998,3.3945,2.9834,1.5007,2.4069,1.515,2.4682,0.1225,2.4498,1.7522,0.6889,0.0002,3.1458,2.8945,0.0057,3.511,5.1158,1.0493,1.1236,2.4448,0.5844,0.8752,1.2073,3.1105,0.571,0.489,0.0926,0.529,6.1354,4.1727,3.1838,1.5993,3.8576,3.496,0.9294,0.04,1.9824,2.6277,2.9693,0.5795,0.036,4.1476,0.2467,0.6068,1.1237,2.7814,4.2868,0.3246,2.903,1.9337,0.1394,0.9008,0.895,0.0002,1.9766,3.2323,5.3291,0.606,0.8773,0.0052,2.3256,0.8514,0.2525,4.455,2.1886,0.0299,2.673,5.3855,1.6974,5.0913,3.2033,5.8491,2.3743,4.6122,3.0944,1.219,3.396,10.3154,5.4617,10.1102,4.7884,1.8198,1.3402,3.0324,3.8517,2.0234,1.504,2.4631,0.673,0.0005,3.4968,1.3744,1.7116,6.2673,2.1014,5.8307,4.1607,5.475,2.595,3.3105,0.094,1.4296,2.9816,0.8484,2.4701,0.6159,0.0011,1.352,1.0266,1.9201,1.771,2.66,2.1929,0.773,0.782,0.6698,3.0983,4.5656,5.0341,2.28,3.0513,2.5863,5.1561,4.419,3.8892,1.2041,2.1505,0.2417,0.1321,0.0466,0.2259,4.2959,1.896,5.902,2.7779,5.3809,1.0511,0.0097,4.0905,4.8567,1.9903,2.6284,3.1066,0.3571,0.0018,1.5656,5.9536,0.785,3.8325,4.1332,1.1284,6.4795,0.4802,2.2282,2.6497,3.0374,2.3712,4.2583,2.9079,3.7723,1.4711,4.1193,3.1103,3.2303,0.3887,0.0056,1.4141,3.7769,3.7749,1.9105,0.8307,3.0664,1.0243,3.96,4.9391,2.0067,0.7691,0.0114,3.5348,1.6285,0.6627,3.5926,0.7688,0.0113,0.6618,0.8429,1.2354,0.0001,2.851,3.6109,5.0036,5.9649,4.8532,5.8389,1.7223,3.0496,2.6189,1.5835,3.1471,0.6056,4.924,0.2531,1.8143,6.1319,1.6882,1.5737,3.2772,2.031,2.2191,0.9558,3.4858,4.6253,5.1179,3.2581,2.4642,0.5602,9.7024,15.6743,4.1656,6.5746,1.7337,2.7347,4.923,3.7862,1.9492,2.3011,2.5067,2.0374,2.4272,3.3979,1.6834,4.2862,2.8014,2.5527,2.1689,2.5926,4.2607,0.9905,5.6113,2.0392,0.4692,0.2857,1.3243,4.9669,3.2963,5.0266,3.0357,2.7074,3.116,0.3144,2.9438,2.4588,1.9669,1.9442,2.6315,9.2925,5.4681,0.0907,1.2407,5.4264,3.2216,2.6608,2.6721,0.0462,0.4563]}
{"id":3029,"ended":true,"length":612,"gen_text":"An ancient evil that laid dormant for 5,000 years re-awakens, however the society it awakes to has advanced to the point to where it poses no threat and no one takes it seriously.\n\nHowever, that is exactly what is happening in the United States today\n\nThe fact is that with all the things that have happened across the world in the short tomedium term, it seems as though America's new superpower is suddenly waking up to its dark history of crime and murder and its fear of any and all criminals in it.\n\nJust ask the young black male that got thrown out of a movie theater for not wearing seatbelt. The person with the black bag on who went to the bathroom and locked himself in the back of the theater to escape.\n\nAnd this is just what happened to our country this fall.\n\nAs a recent post shows, while whites have been in power in this country for over 100 years, blacks can't change it.\n\nThey're never going to be happy with it, and there's a problem with the way things are headed :-D\n\nAnd yet....\n\nIt seems as though the white and the black groups that control the country have just gotten lucky enough to run out of time to run out of power. They're already back where they belong.\n\nIt has taken almost 2 years (and an amazing amount of help) but is now already back where they want to be without any real resistance at all.\n\nEven more amazing is that it has gotten this far because of a new video game called American Dream:\n\nApparently even now, this nation's ruling elite is making sure that every black man who doesn't turn up at their local mall can play a game called American Dream, so their politicians and leaders are giving him time at the grocery store to run amok.\n\nEven after all that trouble that occurred with the game where he had to walk from store to shop at Walmart so many times because everyone was going to take the money out anyway.\n\nIt also seems as though it was going to be years before any black men could be paid in real estate taxes due to what was said about them at the games.\n\nIt seems as though the very same elite that did this to white America has even more money invested in it.\n\n\"This new ruling elite has just gotten all the way to the point where they can make millions of dollars off of it while using their vast wealth to make their own profit over and over again. As a result, with enough of them, American Dream would become a real thing,\" says the game's creator and game artist.\n\n\"One of the big issues that these new elites have with white America is that they need to get more black to work for them. They can't get any more African-American to hold positions of power because they've already been given the power to change things.

We were just all freaking out, like crazy, I wasn't there and he just kept on knocking at the door.\n\nMr McDavid was also seen fleeing the scene before he was found, telling news agencies: 'You better get a job so I don't get the money, I need to run, I need money.'\n\nHe also told The Sun he didn't know how many police officers were at the apartment before the incident.","token_len":656,"entropy":[12.0382,2.8243,3.6219,6.2941,4.3103,4.2398,1.7799,4.0347,7.6793,4.8547,0.4249,1.4977,5.9021,0.2048,2.718,2.917,5.0043,1.1013,1.2724,10.0432,1.4669,2.0127,3.1329,3.5235,5.4692,1.4355,3.0917,6.0235,0.1103,2.6374,3.6821,1.1722,0.58,13.4315,6.3253,7.258,6.4419,1.8949,1.1598,0.0187,3.5156,3.445,2.8878,1.6254,2.213,2.0405,6.1755,8.3914,0.0003,4.5865,3.7312,1.9245,3.6319,2.0448,2.758,0.6556,0.8659,3.3795,0.0665,0.3905,1.8776,1.7436,3.7965,0.9814,1.239,2.9405,2.2285,1.1377,2.4161,2.2359,7.8957,4.7702,1.3604,4.8015,0.3811,2.3505,3.1627,0.9645,2.3055,1.3327,2.6293,0.5215,2.3434,0.9813,4.9055,3.3385,0.9906,2.4125,0.4348,3.5036,1.7614,5.1138,0.5276,0.8096,2.3881,0.0004,1.6771,0.8754,4.7592,1.3111,0.9262,4.6132,0.5691,6.3984,3.3754,1.8031,3.094,5.5884,6.8247,1.4801,3.0321,0.9437,1.2268,0.0004,1.6929,5.9937,1.4954,2.4776,2.7397,3.6095,3.7864,3.6432,0.0928,3.6041,0.5266,0.2654,2.7207,0.8912,2.5585,1.1035,3.9991,2.1013,4.9962,2.7559,0.0722,0.8092,2.4056,2.0671,0.6677,0.0003,3.5866,5.5666,2.5664,4.3423,3.3968,0.0346,5.4941,5.0329,0.0129,0.875,0.1488,1.319,5.7378,5.931,4.6826,3.3655,4.9758,3.7184,2.0839,1.8909,2.5767,1.8817,2.3374,2.8552,3.0011,2.9144,0.9471,1.0494,0.0003,0.2984,4.2789,2.6511,2.0973,3.0263,2.5972,0.2952,5.111,4.0518,1.2509,4.043,5.3116,1.2278,0.0003,3.7029,3.9467,2.1897,2.4538,1.7468,2.8459,0.567,3.0862,2.9099,3.9953,5.2413,0.1204,0.9322,2.8519,1.3698,3.7162,1.056,0.4272,0.4053,1.3657,0.3505,3.986,3.7466,2.2769,4.8841,0.6603,2.7402,0.9628,2.127,0.0003,3.1073,1.7981,2.4569,2.5858,0.8453,3.263,1.9739,0.4634,0.7414,0.0002,6.3551,4.8649,4.3585,3.407,1.5914,0.0225,1.7142,3.3004,1.8743,2.3803,4.8346,0.202,3.9891,4.7194,1.4766,1.3725,4.0804,3.889,1.941,1.3548,2.3562,1.5836,2.0127,3.1199,3.2077,1.9514,2.7883,4.0731,3.5449,1.2337,0.407,0.0003,0.0459,0.9371,1.0903,3.9255,2.7595,1.6501,1.1867,2.7141,3.3556,0.4166,0.9137,2.0127,3.8837,0.7946,1.6259,0.8571,0.0003,0.0503,1.3702,0.867,3.2184,3.2469,5.387,1.6103,1.7824,2.9386,3.0513,2.5107,2.4398,1.6429,0.106,1.3418,6.1752,0.2482,0.5571,2.7896,1.3646,0.7548,1.4383,1.5616,6.9382,1.0399,1.5897,0.7963,5.6573,0.2669,0.0002,2.6625,4.0676,2.8105,0.0196,0.6039,0.716,4.4903,4.6707,5.4577,0.5982,2.2982,1.4893,2.5812,3.1213,1.2768,0.3455,0.0003,4.8516,1.5798,1.0427,1.7665,6.1159,3.3636,0.8445,2.3478,4.7304,0.0002,2.5532,1.8302,2.7944,4.5439,1.3854,2.4764,0.2201,0.0107,0.9734,3.1765,3.4917,2.0419,3.6592,2.0692,2.3772,2.2763,7.0764,4.4098,0.6449,1.4515,3.6496,2.6326,1.2661,1.4576,2.9417,3.2836,4.5993,2.0333,5.2778,3.5322,2.2388,2.4295,2.8558,3.5327,4.73,0.9348,0.452,0.1891,0.0003,0.0444,4.1272,0.6175,1.3968,2.4714,4.2049,4.2898,5.5472,4.9504,1.8904,3.5531,2.4461,5.3344,4.7314,5.7892,0.2066,0.8729,4.841,4.9498,0.7095,3.7111,1.7434,2.1492,5.1494,0.2196,0.5889,3.914,3.2193,0.309,4.1765,2.0799,1.3411,0.3804,4.9399,0.0003,0.1969,2.0421,1.3877,3.399,5.7984,1.7313,1.5787,0.0736,0.7382,0.5607,1.1661,0.901,5.1186,0.6962,3.3978,2.1763,2.8862,2.8879,0.4773,2.1473,0.5456,5.062,0.5909,0.7387,0.0455,0.2089,0.0002,5.1016,1.5556,2.4439,5.171,0.4137,1.8488,6.399,2.0372,2.7428,3.6476,3.6485,0.0151,0.8219,3.5021,0.3627,3.0148,0.0281,0.002,0.8559,0.3212,0.0873,0.9143,2.8102,1.1483,0.1935,4.7569,0.3331,4.8278,0.689,1.1207,1.2542,5.6647,3.1111,3.1925,3.2968,0.4507,0.0004,0.1421,2.7492,1.8893,2.2797,4.3474,2.5126,1.6546,2.9776,1.711,1.9031,3.1952,3.4715,3.7835,2.0049,2.5178,1.0805,4.4134,1.0572,1.4864,1.5204,3.5258,0.8664,3.0937,3.4516,2.6066,4.2808,3.542,2.6472,0.0968,0.0002,3.0773,1.1183,3.2117,3.7543,4.7674,1.2931,3.3189,2.5415,4.0165,3.0294,1.1899,1.2101,2.4365,5.2077,2.0811,1.1671,3.0419,5.2465,2.4286,0.8912,5.6984,2.2328,0.4912,9.6258,3.1197,1.4289,4.7023,3.0459,4.8869,3.1853,1.9778,2.2396,2.2586,4.6219,3.1953,1.0845,6.3044,2.4683,1.189,1.8732,3.7673,5.8398,0.7196,6.0698,0.2736,2.702,4.1195,4.1399,4.105,4.7535,0.3468,0.894,6.4861,0.9778,1.963,0.6142,0.1013,0.0002,1.4748,1.7689,3.882,1.8391,2.4827,4.9721,3.6857,1.0906,2.6544,1.7141,3.577,2.07,2.8326,5.9347,5.622,0.0298,2.5093,4.3434,5.266,1.842,2.2615,5.2549,0.0005,4.5361,3.2845,1.5215,2.3298,1.5746,3.6449,5.9579,1.8507,0.5097,0.1236,1.4767,0.8521,0.0003,4.7523,0.0164,0.0012,3.3205,2.9544,2.732,5.4072,1.1315,0.2625,4.0049,1.6922,0.4754,1.7737,2.7339,4.4486,5.5589,4.1492,0.3879,0.0442,4.8248,5.1791,1.4635,3.7044,2.7244,3.6514,0.9508,1.7145,0.0004,2.5213,4.9246,2.3819,3.498,0.9129,3.7557,1.2633,5.2104,3.4111,0.8279,0.5626,3.4666,1.2808,0.1949,0.0003,1.942,2.8227,1.3809,3.5118,1.5528,2.9153,3.6598,0.0005,1.2872,2.5275,2.2894,4.521,0.6671,0.8966,2.6741,0.4224,3.0936,3.8423,2.1548,2.5652,0.7392]}
{"id":1494,"ended":false,"length":568,"gen_text":"What would it be like if whales meandered about on land instead of swimming in the sea?\n\nNatalie: Well the way to kill whales on land is to feed them meat because it's easier to eat when you have more fat and protein.\n\nNatalie: The point is that eating meat on land is not easy.\n\nNatalie: Is that all so complicated and is it so simple to go around killing whales on land, or where does it come from?\n\nNatalie: It was actually invented by the Smithsonian Fisheries Center with the use of baleen whales that are very good for harvesting food but for some reason are less nutritious, with less nutritional value.\n\nNatalie: There are two interesting examples of baleen whales being killed in the past five years in the US. The first is in February of last year when the largest baleen whale species were found. As part of their research, they found about 90 baleen whales, about three of which are female.\n\nThey found 2 females and a male of another species. A similar baleen whale found just a few miles away.\n\nAnd from that point on they hunted for about 30 miles where they found one of the largest whale species, which was so long it was only a few hundred feet long. So what is the story behind these discoveries?\n\nNatalie: Well those baleen whales were so far apart in size because they could never live as close to each other. The reason these whales were so close to each other is because they died in their beds very slowly from eating each other, then getting up the night before and eating each other so their bodies would not grow long enough to eat. One of the whales was born very long ago in South Africa, and that whale is named Jugga. And that whales will be released soon after those large baleen whales arrive.\n\nAnd after the release of this new species, which is actually the last known baleen whale that will be hunted for food today, that baleen whale population will rise to about 1,000 per year.\n\nNatalie: Well that's exciting. So what do you wish you could know about baleen whales? The fact that they hunt only for food. If you could talk about the research that you have done now where you have found baleen whales in Canada, where you have found baleen whales going from one place to another in Canada, but where they live where they go to be hunted and where then are present baleen whales that need food, and so of course, what do you wish you wanted to know more about?\n\nNatalie: Well we've discovered an interesting way that there's much more food on the planet than whales. It's known as whale-eating.\n\nNatalie: How much does it cost to hunt these whales?\n\nNatalie: One thousand baleen whales is one man's life.\n\nNatalie: It's about \u00a330,000.\n\nNatalie (to James in the video), please help us find the funding here : http:\/\/www.paypal.me\/sgtab\n\nAbout James","token_len":658,"entropy":[5.2357,2.6012,1.4941,0.1609,1.0249,10.9325,11.3818,1.7145,0.005,4.7046,2.9803,3.5596,5.3914,0.0565,4.3245,1.4121,1.214,2.1066,0.3488,1.092,0.0068,5.0891,4.0762,2.7091,2.9112,4.1697,3.8994,3.5661,5.9636,0.5846,3.0265,0.1319,0.2857,0.8555,5.2347,0.2832,4.9516,5.7672,1.8857,0.748,4.163,0.3553,1.8642,3.0755,0.9068,1.7756,2.5814,5.0653,2.415,3.5014,1.1968,1.8775,0.0002,2.5947,0.0993,0.1804,3.169,5.46,0.651,1.2308,4.2334,1.2065,3.1787,0.0369,0.8364,2.4229,4.6562,1.0639,2.1138,0.0001,0.4243,0.0108,0.0107,5.7996,1.3041,5.1265,5.2752,4.8801,3.9367,4.7024,0.8965,3.914,2.837,1.3474,5.4061,3.0625,2.7965,0.4539,1.4938,0.116,3.4146,2.0122,6.6429,3.0248,0.9521,2.8097,0.0802,0.216,0.2228,0.0001,0.1762,0.0019,0.0012,1.7399,4.5413,4.0814,3.6601,0.6792,1.9591,5.4797,2.8337,3.0976,5.7353,1.176,6.6842,0.0033,5.6274,0.8176,0.0681,0.1545,3.0236,2.3272,3.3535,3.5306,3.3208,5.482,2.636,4.4827,5.0336,3.3629,0.3409,3.1768,5.0443,4.3658,3.6136,5.9863,2.8493,4.3464,0.2198,0.7835,0.8286,0.0001,0.4617,0.0052,0.0444,4.0791,1.0375,2.8611,6.0915,4.7406,0.7817,2.444,0.0079,0.0041,0.1541,3.3342,1.3316,2.6777,1.1213,3.9459,5.0077,0.3372,2.8083,1.4909,2.3801,0.6125,2.1501,0.1815,1.3587,2.6668,5.5374,1.0426,2.6652,0.0058,1.6102,1.6831,4.1907,1.7672,0.0026,0.0038,0.0906,4.659,3.6207,2.0112,2.9947,5.5438,3.7074,0.0009,2.1643,2.2635,1.0562,1.7253,2.1818,5.0867,4.4789,2.1864,0.0067,0.0096,0.0404,2.9268,3.4144,3.9948,3.7557,0.5418,1.576,5.5951,0.4636,1.0462,0.0001,2.7213,1.6119,5.8922,3.226,1.7969,3.1304,0.7389,3.4064,4.5465,0.2847,0.9183,5.2796,4.7606,3.7989,0.0029,0.0132,0.2543,3.8211,4.4545,1.7309,0.451,2.6196,0.6233,2.2427,1.1707,0.0001,3.7155,5.8468,1.9614,2.7822,0.6318,2.3578,4.9696,3.5341,1.5526,2.9769,3.3271,5.4119,0.6176,0.885,4.1691,2.0387,0.4606,2.6594,4.813,0.5204,2.5685,3.1323,1.5687,5.4308,5.4128,1.7108,1.0548,4.4598,2.1632,1.2728,2.7662,0.6803,0.8623,0.4701,3.3812,3.9081,3.049,1.2064,4.017,0.9649,3.3578,5.6302,0.2868,0.3839,0.0001,0.3787,0.001,0.004,2.3752,6.3854,2.0102,0.0155,0.0116,0.0422,1.3627,3.7506,4.551,2.6001,2.6317,0.4541,4.175,0.7313,4.0652,4.4457,4.8527,5.5327,0.451,0.9315,0.4233,0.0159,0.8222,3.1699,3.3686,4.3857,1.5786,1.2772,0.5656,0.9698,1.5817,0.1376,0.0114,1.2693,0.2674,0.8236,6.2262,2.3484,4.2724,5.2748,5.1761,3.674,4.4565,3.7185,1.4957,0.0234,2.6484,5.2902,4.1424,2.4566,4.3004,4.4375,0.3459,1.9841,1.5761,1.0763,0.0202,5.5589,4.3211,1.282,1.4174,2.0895,4.1529,5.1488,0.7006,0.5204,2.422,3.4355,6.2866,0.5326,0.2214,3.4148,2.3111,4.5468,4.2581,4.8495,1.0062,3.1425,4.4496,0.8985,1.7561,1.4979,3.0876,2.1117,1.8364,3.3366,4.8371,4.2839,5.5604,0.809,3.7598,2.2906,4.5953,4.2978,2.5144,5.0046,4.041,1.9552,6.0214,5.7499,1.8099,0.0224,0.0089,0.0546,4.7911,1.3005,0.3772,0.0001,2.1733,5.2625,2.6277,0.8624,0.6864,3.7898,2.9997,0.95,0.9727,4.0229,1.008,4.4855,2.1482,4.6872,3.8032,1.0942,0.001,0.0051,0.0509,2.2278,3.1183,0.4651,6.0201,1.3691,1.3645,6.4294,0.2299,3.3235,3.1622,0.0019,0.0029,0.2851,4.1844,0.6149,4.6646,2.04,1.4697,3.1275,0.3837,0.7278,4.7389,0.2532,0.6328,1.0824,0.0001,1.3421,0.0008,0.0102,3.5745,1.8874,0.7801,4.4572,0.9055,2.9522,1.7,2.3843,0.2962,7.8214,1.6166,0.5892,4.1964,0.2696,2.8258,0.0037,0.007,0.1037,0.8847,4.9773,4.6953,0.4745,0.5403,6.3172,5.575,0.9837,0.4618,3.0719,4.6402,0.7754,1.7533,3.8985,0.6639,1.9342,5.0356,1.2513,1.3265,2.4797,0.6049,5.6168,5.9863,1.2604,1.484,1.9588,2.7879,0.0024,0.0045,0.0374,2.4539,5.7009,0.8488,2.1533,1.4247,0.7097,0.6046,1.7672,0.002,0.0027,0.0374,6.0366,2.9935,2.2801,1.5288,0.154,0.1833,2.2933,2.1438,0.6404,5.9752,2.3655,1.6953,3.983,3.9754,0.3296,3.4698,1.6795,3.5368,2.0193,2.2934,1.1281,7.6878,3.9533,7.6564,4.8321,0.0128,0.0031,0.0386,2.0044,5.1476,2.4166,1.7107,3.1431,3.9515,6.8598,0.1237,2.3565,2.2446,2.0669,0.0326,0.7614,0.3365,7.334,0.2015,0.0802,3.6912,0.132,0.4733,0.1448,0.0001,0.1096,0.001,0.0014,0.5236,3.6357,2.9376,4.2262,4.4827,1.3903,3.3063,2.6009,4.759,2.155,5.376,0.7642,2.43,3.342,1.2338,1.7449,0.7701,4.1607,1.7374,3.0576,0.4145,4.1366,0.3491,4.284,2.5489,1.8436,1.7127,1.0153,0.0001,0.7236,0.0029,0.0121,4.4095,2.8954,2.429,1.0438,0.2175,0.339,1.7277,3.0869,0.506,0.7401,0.4211,0.0001,0.0241,0.0028,0.001,4.5768,4.4707,5.5269,0.0311,0.0044,0.0291,2.7736,3.3721,4.8136,0.4899,1.9752,0.8771,1.5492,0.0001,0.1469,0.0033,0.0112,3.3297,0.4967,3.4195,4.7241,3.6243,0.7607,0.0409,1.5094,0.5557,0.0001,0.1058,0.005,7.7178,2.1732,4.3863,5.2958,1.0283,2.7685,4.5594,5.5719,4.2604,1.1984,2.9215,2.0358,5.9648,5.7717,6.3224,1.6525,0.0012,0.4549,0.0007,3.8084,0.171,0.002,1.3439,0.0079,9.6363,9.9676,3.6456,0.0003,5.5481,3.4555]}
{"id":1396,"ended":false,"length":596,"gen_text":"The other heroes forced him to become a villain.\n\n. The other characters were almost taken by surprise, especially the other Avengers, who were so obsessed with them that they did everything they knew to make them enemies.\n\nThis is not a bad description of the other heroes, though.\n\nCompare Man Who Is In Charge (Marvel and Disney comics) and Captain America: Civil War (Marvel, Disney) and Superman: Rise of the Man of Steel (Marvel\/ABC) and The Defenders (ABC, Marvel) and The Punisher (Warner Bros; Marvel Marvel\/Arrow\/CW\/CW\/CBS) ; one of these characters is an actual character, not a mythological one.\n\nExamples\n\nopen\/close all folders\n\nAnime & Manga\n\nFan Works\n\nFilms \u2014 Animation\n\nLiterature\n\nLive-Action TV\n\nRadio\n\nToys\n\nIn World War Z some of the other world leaders were in favor of making the humans in this setting become heroes. In one episode from World War Z, a few of the soldiers are shown to be heroes (including Colonel Jack Sparrow), but they were portrayed to serve the greater Good, like the heroes of the Civil War (even now there are other such heroes, as well).\n\nIn the The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy, there is always a sort of \"human-as-human\" conflict that is never resolved unless a certain amount of money has been raised.\n\nIn The Lord of the Rings Online, it's said that, \"the world has gone evil for millions of years and mankind has succeeded nothing more but poverty and war. One is given a place in the middle which is supposed to provide refuge to those who do not serve. No one's right to be there is allowed; there is no freedom; there is no freedom of speech, no freedom of religion, and only when you are given that freedom is life.\"\n\nThis makes almost every noncanon story of Star Trek, despite the fact that it's not actually the Enterprise that comes in contact with its crew; instead, it's a bunch of crew members, all of whom are in no hurry to make their place in one place and to be part of another and try to do a decent job.\n\nIn the story of Doctor Strange, both the main star of the character, Dr. Horace and her crew are \"a couple of people who live happily ever after.\" Doctor Strange's story tells about her upbringing and family, that she lived with a brother of her own to escape the chaos of the world before the Great War. And, like every other good fellow, she is also a lot of fun to be around.

{"id":351,"ended":false,"length":605,"gen_text":"Your door bell rings. It's a person from an alternate universe, who says, `` I just want you to know that you are my favorite book character and I know how it ends and I want to help change it ''.\n\nIt was in the year 2000 that I wrote the short story \"The Magic of Being. In this section I explore the possibilities and possibilities that you may discover that are difficult to describe as books, and also show that there is a place within this world for you and me to feel and say the most.\n\nIt is a very personal story and I hope you will find this book enlightening and entertaining for your reading pleasure. As we go through the first part of your story it doesn't take you long to see how much is at stake.\u00a0\n\nBy\u00a0 J.J. Abrams\n\nDirect reading: by J.J. Abrams\n\nSummary: I am writing with my husband, J.J., an Assistant Professor of English at Syracuse University. He is a big fan of the stories and his work has influenced so many people and has taken my mind off the things I said.\n\nI love getting good stories, and while I know writing is really good, there's not as much information out there about who you are, where you are, what you do, what books you read, what you write. I feel like this is also something that can affect you.\n\nThe other thing I did while writing this story was make the character of Tiana the \"She-Devour.\" She had a life of her own. They could never live as they did. They had a lot of problems, and one day she said to me, \"If you want to survive, you must give up writing and find something else to read. You have so much to tell this story about.\" I know my husband is not a big fan of a writer's block I am a bit of a fan, but he gave me that inspiration. I read all of those stories, and found I found I could write it out in a way that was so interesting with the characters, the relationships, the romance, the struggles.\n\nOn the other hand, I've not read the books at all.\u00a0\n\nI decided to write The Curse Of The Lost Sea (or The Battle of the Lost Sea, or possibly some of my favorite books from the book collection) because I needed to have a real read and I think it's worth the effort. It's kind of a dark story with some kind of religious imagery. I'm taking a stab at religion, but I think I would enjoy a real read of the stories.\n\nI want you to take a look at The Lost Sea after reading and if there is any other reading material for you to like then click the button below.

{"id":3072,"ended":true,"length":613,"gen_text":"Wrong Path, where I live in South Florida. The story of this amazing family of writers, writers' groups, and musicians has been a great one across the world.\n\nMy story begins in 1988 as I was 14 years old on Halloween night.\n\nI was at my parents' home and had a Halloween Party.\n\nIt was a very good party for most of us. However, it actually wasn't so great for my grandparents or my older brothers. On the other hand, one thing I remember very well is one night I was drinking at my grandparents' house, with a nice table filled with a pretty good selection of candy.\n\nI found the drink inside a small box, and began to pick up some stuff.\n\nIt was a lot of really good stuff, and a big dose of candy. As soon as I found the box, I immediately hit my head on top of some of the other things I'd recently picked up, and my body was blown away. I started looking for what I'd found.\n\nNext I got really close to a candy bar. I thought I'd found the Candy Carousel!\n\nIt looked like I'd found two different candy bars.\n\nThe first is the famous \"Candy Bar\" candy bar.\n\nThe second is the famous \"Wicked Candy\" Candy bar.\n\nOnce I could get the Candy Bar, I thought I knew what had been done. But I never knew what next!\n\nI started using a book as a source, and I was the sole source for this book. When I realized this, I went with it at my own risk, because all the books I've written about my story didn't even exist before Halloween. They were just being a lazy book read.\n\nIt took me a few years to figure out how I got into the candy bar, and with no one having given me a clue, I began trying to figure out where I was going to get it.\n\nBy this point, my imagination took on some shape and gave me a little bit of hope.\n\nThis was my first attempt at candy.\n\nMy original initial idea for candy was one of the first recipes that I ever made, that just wanted candy to be something to eat but also to feel really good\u2026\n\nSo I had this book.\n\nI was very passionate about it, and even though it hadn't made much money, I was so excited.\n\nThen they found that there was really a candy thing going on right now! How does that make me happy?\n\nIt just made sense.\n\nSo I started doing what I thought would be fun, and making treats for the people I love. A few years later, Candy Bars came out and I was on a mission!\n\nWe found a way to make candy from the real ingredients \u2013 something that no one saw coming.\n\nThis is my first book as an author,

{"id":4840,"ended":false,"length":605,"gen_text":"Your door bell rings. It's a person from an alternate universe, who says, `` I just want you to know that you are my favorite book character and I know how it ends and I want to help change it ''.\n\nIt was in the year 2000 that I wrote the short story \"The Magic of Being. In this section I explore the possibilities and possibilities that you may discover that are difficult to describe as books, and also show that there is a place within this world for you and me to feel and say the most.\n\nIt is a very personal story and I hope you will find this book enlightening and entertaining for your reading pleasure. As we go through the first part of your story it doesn't take you long to see how much is at stake.\u00a0\n\nBy\u00a0 J.J. Abrams\n\nDirect reading: by J.J. Abrams\n\nSummary: I am writing with my husband, J.J., an Assistant Professor of English at Syracuse University. He is a big fan of the stories and his work has influenced so many people and has taken my mind off the things I said.\n\nI love getting good stories, and while I know writing is really good, there's not as much information out there about who you are, where you are, what you do, what books you read, what you write. I feel like this is also something that can affect you.\n\nThe other thing I did while writing this story was make the character of Tiana the \"She-Devour.\" She had a life of her own. They could never live as they did. They had a lot of problems, and one day she said to me, \"If you want to survive, you must give up writing and find something else to read. You have so much to tell this story about.\" I know my husband is not a big fan of a writer's block I am a bit of a fan, but he gave me that inspiration. I read all of those stories, and found I found I could write it out in a way that was so interesting with the characters, the relationships, the romance, the struggles.\n\nOn the other hand, I've not read the books at all.\u00a0\n\nI decided to write The Curse Of The Lost Sea (or The Battle of the Lost Sea, or possibly some of my favorite books from the book collection) because I needed to have a real read and I think it's worth the effort. It's kind of a dark story with some kind of religious imagery. I'm taking a stab at religion, but I think I would enjoy a real read of the stories.\n\nI want you to take a look at The Lost Sea after reading and if there is any other reading material for you to like then click the button below.

Your job is to walk the trails of the world to record them.\n\nYour job is to walk the trails of the world to record them\n\nThe fact is if you make it from Google you should never worry about the safety of the trail or what it might look like on Google maps. Your job is to make it safe for you and all other people and to make sure people see you in the first place.\n\nWhen you are at the trail it is easy to get lost. It is better to walk it. On the trail it is more dangerous to look for you; on the trail you are looking for a good place to see your car. Google maps show you where to meet you at the trail's intersection, and your phone records your conversations. You probably won't notice any suspicious behavior because they don't give you any direction from what is visible to you.\n\nBut, as there is so much information about your car, Google maps will show some of the other things it shows you. It turns out there is a lot of information on the way you see Google on Google vehicles, like who you are driving with and what your traffic is doing. They can use their maps to help track you. When Google says, \"See your way!\" you can now get directions, such as \"Go where you want to go without any traffic and see where I am going,\" and where the other cars are heading.\n\nWhen Google says \"See your way!\" you can now get directions, such as \"Go where you want to go without any traffic and see where I am going,\" and where the other cars are heading.\n\nThe Google Maps effect takes this information and turns it into information about people, places and their surroundings. It allows people to see what's out there and, in fact, even see you.\n\nThese images were shot in the early morning on a cold January day out in Santa Clara, California, and with no lighting, so they were still very good for a Google Earth image shot at the end of the day. The next day at night they were great for some of the next day's photos. This time I am using a Google Daydream 3, which is a free, Android 7.0-based Google Daydream smartphone. If you own a smartphone you can just go on the free Android app to use Google Photos and bring up your photos.\n\nWhen I'm taking pictures and writing reports, my wife is sitting near a bike rack for about a half-mile. I usually have about nine pictures going in my head, which is a very high number, but she takes about two photos a day. The two pictures below are all of her rides in the last 25 days.\n\nYou can take less pictures of rides, which in real life may take a lot of time to do, but the best way to see what's out there is to look at what's there. You might see people walking, watching us, or just making an observation. It also helps to have your camera on at all times, because it can tell you the speed of the car's exhaust fumes, making it much easier to spot it and figure out which way you were using it.","token_len":666,"entropy":[3.8828,2.3263,2.6508,7.6302,8.2236,2.5438,1.7865,1.8665,1.4437,7.7047,3.4183,0.915,3.6745,4.8181,0.2721,0.2309,5.2744,2.7334,5.1212,1.9213,1.3825,1.034,2.8188,7.6183,5.9042,1.1267,1.7813,0.001,3.861,1.0733,0.0916,0.1148,2.9211,0.1276,0.0144,0.0059,0.0026,0.0021,0.0088,0.0109,0.0377,5.0865,0.0002,3.3386,5.5256,1.4823,5.093,0.1927,5.3117,1.3626,5.2034,5.5831,2.069,4.6419,3.6397,5.3267,0.1597,2.6497,4.3858,0.2447,2.5726,0.9426,2.4788,4.352,2.4959,1.7168,0.6253,0.0017,2.5694,3.873,1.4942,0.3106,4.0647,0.4529,0.1701,0.1241,2.4472,1.9278,2.537,1.4316,1.056,1.3203,5.3776,3.0373,2.113,4.8258,1.8522,1.8808,0.9794,4.1004,4.3728,1.3839,3.4787,0.9999,3.771,0.0164,0.1614,0.5162,0.0001,4.2817,0.705,2.294,3.8669,1.8438,0.4573,4.8468,0.6129,3.6335,0.2218,1.9498,0.3669,1.1828,2.0985,0.3431,5.3258,0.225,3.6647,3.4278,3.0603,5.6057,1.5603,1.953,1.5763,0.1894,3.0048,2.8817,1.312,4.0625,1.4595,1.9145,6.0705,2.5949,0.3661,0.2528,1.8857,1.2114,4.2387,0.2569,1.8998,5.0752,1.8359,0.1439,5.4031,3.0001,1.9245,0.4699,4.7596,1.0729,3.2159,0.8316,1.1718,1.6571,7.3362,3.2135,3.1186,1.4119,0.6482,2.9608,5.172,1.8202,1.7349,3.924,3.2915,4.5069,1.2642,4.8511,1.3894,2.5446,5.8351,2.9052,0.0004,3.585,2.8981,5.3346,2.3479,3.983,4.3438,2.2844,0.0008,4.9018,0.1608,2.2388,3.8614,3.2713,5.5492,2.351,4.1468,1.6646,0.5693,0.2426,0.5542,0.0001,3.6439,3.6738,3.4314,6.6903,0.8601,4.068,0.1509,1.9,1.4853,2.2349,1.7076,1.3336,2.6201,0.8916,2.5833,2.342,6.4528,1.4985,1.7425,4.8669,1.5756,4.0189,2.9006,0.7721,0.6217,2.8291,6.4698,0.4393,2.8991,1.0751,1.0047,1.9638,1.2383,0.821,3.1423,1.5727,3.5568,0.5869,3.4347,1.4505,4.3304,1.9497,7.0105,1.6716,4.8859,4.4159,0.744,0.8969,1.8373,0.9582,1.6424,1.4863,2.5146,5.7958,2.4539,1.8375,0.6798,5.2869,2.3395,4.9007,3.9651,2.1436,0.1856,2.3609,5.4925,0.8016,1.6802,5.0445,3.0158,4.1056,3.4002,0.1393,3.2386,2.887,4.5639,5.6647,1.8185,2.4417,5.0314,3.292,3.3894,3.0685,4.816,0.0044,2.5532,2.6648,4.6153,0.3447,0.5693,0.3367,0.1023,6.2049,3.6587,3.5195,4.4191,2.3664,0.9229,3.4125,1.1763,0.8219,1.1146,1.7972,4.9436,3.9174,3.0704,1.6955,0.4771,4.0145,0.2857,0.5561,0.0002,3.4962,1.8568,0.4405,1.5004,0.4031,0.225,0.009,0.2388,0.2443,0.0719,0.025,0.0446,0.0026,0.036,0.0035,0.0034,0.0191,0.0032,0.0004,0.0016,0.0024,0.0007,0.0008,0.0029,0.0088,0.0013,0.0011,0.0045,0.0027,0.0027,0.0009,0.0016,0.1232,0.001,0.0044,0.0022,0.002,0.0156,0.0027,0.0726,0.0622,1.1707,0.0001,2.8616,2.4409,1.4314,5.7629,5.4578,5.6592,1.2674,0.7958,1.1231,0.0552,0.04,2.9472,0.9219,3.6724,2.3869,0.3732,0.8969,5.6681,3.7223,0.1871,1.6098,3.4449,1.5773,0.121,1.2183,2.1722,2.5641,2.8084,0.0209,1.3056,4.5105,1.9135,3.3103,0.0023,4.9427,2.0961,2.8094,0.6804,1.1088,0.0001,5.7421,4.0526,3.0247,3.9733,1.8239,2.2275,2.8846,2.0397,3.0672,1.8233,4.3541,3.6461,0.9607,6.7377,0.5871,5.4299,2.3104,1.1107,0.2948,1.5354,1.5394,5.6445,2.5928,4.7571,1.8441,2.4656,1.2235,1.1712,5.0338,2.9861,4.3738,3.669,1.946,3.2848,5.4041,2.4479,5.4878,2.1536,2.2036,2.6036,0.0109,1.1229,0.2534,0.3033,2.1762,5.0391,0.6165,4.5902,3.2218,2.3919,0.5937,4.3755,1.4227,4.9809,2.9893,0.3398,4.9951,1.4126,0.1106,2.3046,0.7474,4.4565,2.8024,2.3742,4.1053,1.9562,1.6549,2.3825,4.9655,0.5525,3.0134,3.5529,1.0376,1.0789,1.1367,3.7267,2.7919,4.791,5.8805,0.2053,0.5074,1.9192,0.9214,3.0684,1.4092,0.0009,3.1954,1.0547,4.6607,0.1211,4.9635,1.0384,2.6423,2.301,0.7074,4.8952,3.886,3.3064,1.8325,3.689,4.0553,0.9992,2.839,2.7503,1.8068,5.2367,1.7113,5.4953,1.089,1.8966,3.0354,1.2985,0.9537,0.0001,3.923,1.1665,3.6907,4.7758,1.5576,3.3452,5.0165,4.7261,1.5186,2.8611,5.1787,2.7544,3.1826,4.5037,2.4236,5.2734,0.9058,5.4369,2.9182,2.6965,1.2898,2.2831,1.3741,1.2892,1.9086,5.0092,3.1648,2.7484,6.0926,3.9237,5.5536,1.8689,2.2255,0.532,1.5794,3.1793,1.0663,2.3964,4.0251,3.735,1.229,2.5936,0.722,2.1171,4.0986,1.7552,2.5504,3.8676,0.9898,0.0735,0.5639,2.843,5.0325,2.8277,5.2084,0.8309,4.4948,1.8036,1.2682,5.6994,2.6736,0.9746,3.4125,5.456,1.1576,0.5576,1.0315,0.0001,4.3389,0.5117,3.6345,6.206,1.7194,2.0557,6.6567,2.1505,3.773,5.0279,5.8926,0.0325,4.8477,2.2694,1.9356,2.1991,0.9993,0.5472,2.3634,1.1714,1.2414,0.6037,2.6633,4.217,1.0227,0.1141,2.7856,2.2235,1.2673,0.8131,0.0091,0.2733,0.4025,2.6839,0.5495,3.1692,0.786,3.9087,0.5675,2.8138,3.4479,1.9682,3.4252,2.4369,2.3329,5.8583,5.7589,1.3063,1.7054,2.7752,5.1688,4.6167,2.4023,0.7389,2.9169,4.9109,1.1781,0.7478,2.3421,3.3925,2.741,1.8721,4.455,0.2998,0.0066,1.5506,2.1929,2.0572,2.4712,2.8845,0.6766,3.1381,3.8584,0.8628,0.8867,1.8979,4.1923,5.0193,5.0085,1.5761,5.6255,0.5797,3.0385,0.5682,0.1388,2.4074,3.795,2.8129,4.637,0.0384,3.9057,1.3756,2.2102,4.1255,5.8109,0.4551,0.2284]}
{"id":1091,"ended":true,"length":592,"gen_text":"Your partner is waking up from a sixty year long cryogenic sleep. The reason? After sixty years, a cure has been found.\n\n. The reason??????\n\nHere's the short version\n\nSleep-inducing treatments with short-acting antioxidants also help combat colds.\n\nShort duration\n\nIt's hard to put into words what it is.\n\nColds are usually caused by respiratory and circulatory respiratory conditions.\n\nIt is a very serious problem for most people, because colds are actually very intense and intense.\n\nColds are often accompanied with death, which makes colds most deadly.\n\nPeople who are exposed for any length of time to long duration medications such as anti-depressants or long duration antidepressants will often develop a blood vessel buildup during the cryogenic sleep. These buildup makes it easier for the body to take a break, especially your heart, and help you breathe again.\n\nI have never found this a problem for the elderly. Just have a short while during the cryogenic sleep.\n\n.. I have not found any significant decrease in the risk of lung cancer as some people claim.\n\nSo, it does not seem that antidepressants are very harmful for the elderly, the way to give the mood some relaxation: they also lower your risk of having heart problems.\n\nConclusion\n\nShort term, short-term drugs don't provide much health benefit, and don't prove the same benefits over and over again. They could provide the same benefit, but after three decades of usage, the main concern for me is that long-term use may create very dangerous risk factors for myocardial infarction.\n\nI also don't understand why they aren't being evaluated on longer-lasting ways, such as in the long-term study I gave up on years ago (as part of the research project on long-term memory that led to this article). I'm not sure if it is just a case of people who can't even remember the last days of their life, or will have to rely on long-time drug use, not that long use is a problem if something goes wrong with it. My experiences have been that with drugs I use they do not do much, but sometimes they allow myocardial infarction to continue. There is absolutely no risk for short-term use of a drug, but we need to pay attention to what is going on, and take precautions to protect our health when going with drugs, otherwise we end up with a new drug that makes us sick. Many of the older individuals are on medications that they know that won't really harm them, so I understand how people choose to experience those symptoms when going over a dose. But even if we can't take the medicine that will give us them better health and better living conditions, people might be willing, if their lives are truly a mess they take a little medicine that turns things around and doesn't make them sick.\n\nWhen the effects of long-term drug use are evaluated against the risks for myocardial infarction, I suggest that many of the newer drug doses can help some people stay on drugs, some not, but those with long-term exposure to longer-term drug use may not be well

{"id":4781,"ended":false,"length":631,"gen_text":"Make me feel the most intense sadness\/non-physical pain you ever experienced... I couldn't feel the way I'd felt before. I felt something akin to a person crying with all its flesh and blood\u2026 That was the way I felt to start the time.\n\nThis wasn't some mental state that was normal for me. This was a very specific event and it was my life.\n\nI have been through much less than I wanted. This realization was my defining moment in the new year, and I will never forget it. When I was nine weeks pregnant this past fall I had never experienced a time where I was less nervous, less stressed, the way I felt during any period of time. I know what a happy pregnant woman feels while you're away giving your baby love and loving the baby and taking care of it, but the feeling is one and the same\u2026\n\nWe are so blessed that so many people have the experience to live through, so many of us have felt it with our children. I couldn't help but think of how I feel about that feeling as I had just arrived home from school.\n\nWe had been having so very healthy relationships. On the other hand, one of the saddest memories I feel most is when I was only twelve weeks pregnant. It took me several months to finally get through the months of anxiety and pain I found myself in due to the pregnancies. It got easier every week due to that fact as they had grown past three months.\n\nAfter this pregnancy I felt less and less comfortable about my body shape. It took me a significant period of time to realize that it had become a full body problem. It was my body that I was trying to protect, it was my body I was supposed to be protecting and that my belly didn't go any farther than that. At this point I was so ready myself\u2026\n\nWhile I was trying to get through this pregnancy and finally get rid of the shame I was put through, my body began losing its strength.\n\nThis means my body became not just thinner from being pregnant. My body took on less shape and gave away its true form. I am trying again to re-educate myself on health and my body. The day after I had my first baby I became sick for a week, I just wanted to stop worrying about it and stop worrying about what I'd do to make sure I had healthy, beautiful body parts.\n\nWhen I arrived in the hospital a few days after the second baby, I was so thankful. We were going to see one another after the surgery so I could see what it would be like to walk around the hospital. We were going all over the entire hospital. I knew everything that there was to see, everything we needed to do. It was the beginning of a new year and it had definitely changed the way I felt.\n\nWe were able to get through our new journey together in the hospital by helping one another walk around the room together, talking for days while my doctors took care of my body, and getting ready for our second baby.\n\nMy story will always be a personal one, but also of incredible strength and health.\n\nThank you and God bless your soul.\n\nAnd God Bless your

They are the same people that have made it this far, because they knew it would take a lot for your body to have all the ingredients you needed so that it would work. Everything that they could have said would have made it easier for you to handle it with ease. A normal body produces an egg or a protein by itself. As a result, your body's immune system starts giving you proteins like the ones that help it grow its natural size, make your mouth, and help you breathe.\"\n\n- Dr. Charles S. Blyth, MD\n\n\"If you're reading this you won't think twice about what you see. I know you're thinking of having your body make its own vaccines. But not only are they really good for your health but you can be given a whole whole new set of vaccines. And all your body needs to do is work together with the genetic programming system to ensure the survival of their own bodies. You can go viral and become the first human on the face of the planet.\"\n\n- Prof. Jonathan S. LeClair, MD\n\n\"What we are doing this week is a great opportunity and it is about keeping the science to one's own and developing a vaccine. The more science is developed on our own, the better this vaccine will be. We want to protect the humans from their very real sickness and diseases. I have never seen anything like it. The world's largest government funded vaccine company is one of many companies promoting a vaccine that I can personally recommend to my patients. And if it can only be used once, then this is an extremely important step in our future as we continue to get more medical evidence that will take place over the next few decades.\"\n\n- Prof. Richard Larkin, MD\n\n\"This has been going on all over the world, but we were just reminded today of one of the things that should be addressed and I think has a real effect now. We are getting evidence of what really needs to be done in order to make the entire community feel healthy and healthy. Now, we are getting new research that will help us understand that. I think the public needs science and they should care about good research and we should care about good scientific research and have the right to know that. We know this all too well, right? We need to have the knowledge that we need to make sure that those who are sick are not going to get better.\"\n\n- Dr. John J.

{"id":4075,"ended":true,"length":647,"gen_text":"You buy your son a teddy bear. Unknown to you, the bear pledged his life to your son. Every night, it protects your son from the monsters in the dark.\n\nYour daughter was in the kitchen when she was bitten. The bear kept her away because of her brother's terrible sins. Your daughter knew she has to keep feeding the bear. The bear said she will come back once her brother has been eaten out of his mouth. In all his days and nights the bear had not yet finished killing the mother and he had still done so. Your daughter had been watching you and she was crying because you have stopped her. On the other hand your daughter was crying for you. Her brother never came home for fear of her..\n\nThe bear didn't bother you again for weeks or months later... Your blood froze inside your brain... You went into the forest with little patience and never thought about it.. your parents were no help to you... As soon as there was blood inside your brain your parents... called to you and said you won't leave your children alone... I know you don't want to give up your children, but I hope you know what I can do for them when they die...\n\nYou asked for help through the internet and your mom was so helpful so you could find the way back to your own home... How we were able to find this amazing family had always been a problem.... My parents got in trouble because they could never live as they had always done...\n\nAfter this one day, my sons and I decided to make an art project that would bring them back home..... This will allow our sons to live in this place long distance.... Our little brother and I have a painting on our mantelpiece that will let him see where we were... We also have a print on our mantelpiece that will let us picture it out in the middle of the day.... I was really pleased with the quality of the work. I think it will help our son because not only will his mother and father die when the bear comes home and walks away with him, but I am pleased that my son will stay a long time and see my little boys grow up.... There will be so much for your sons to remember and a lot of memories..... They will really want to go to this place....\n\nThese pictures, my wife and I would love to see people standing in the park that night and enjoying the natural beauty of this tiny community that we have been born into.... Our grandchildren and great grandchildren would like to see it... all of these pictures will be forever engraved on my mantelpiece... We will also continue this project through your help, through your support and by sharing our passion for photography, photography and photography with you and my grandchildren... our dear grandchildren in the near future...\n\nThere may be times in their lives when you will have to send them pictures that will bring back many memories.....

and yet in a way no criminal offences were committed at all by the IRA in the 1970s\".\n\nHe added: \"They will no doubt be found guilty, and yet they will commit no criminal offence at all.\"","token_len":670,"entropy":[7.9972,2.6884,3.1175,5.4694,5.7804,3.826,4.7393,1.3279,5.2548,5.08,1.0928,1.8513,2.7779,10.0824,0.6154,0.0481,12.8924,2.2355,6.4325,0.1229,1.8723,1.6481,0.5732,5.279,3.3383,4.0551,7.7391,8.7366,5.6495,0.9658,1.2293,2.4141,4.003,5.4264,9.3304,0.5797,1.6266,1.2136,0.8923,4.425,0.5869,4.3786,4.5198,10.0632,12.2669,4.473,2.8297,5.2775,0.4496,4.3172,3.281,0.7977,1.4903,0.0769,3.4599,3.3156,3.0489,3.564,3.4741,5.2323,1.8291,5.1059,3.6693,1.9409,6.0445,0.9377,0.263,0.1793,5.7907,2.5488,3.0645,3.5917,1.067,0.9706,4.5767,4.3301,0.9507,1.2119,2.1038,1.3114,0.5399,0.0004,2.7908,5.8075,1.4373,0.897,0.0278,0.0105,0.4756,0.2113,0.1304,0.0006,0.0011,0.0469,0.0086,0.0005,0.0011,0.0013,0.0058,0.4417,0.1002,0.0068,0.0102,0.0008,0.0031,0.0028,0.0011,0.0008,0.0017,0.0011,0.001,0.0032,0.0009,0.0016,0.0009,0.0009,0.0025,2.5615,0.7267,0.0001,1.5535,3.6354,2.1561,6.4057,4.03,4.2576,0.435,4.1126,3.5752,4.5084,3.7858,4.9681,3.5043,2.2497,2.5198,2.6097,5.3329,1.4683,3.0886,4.5585,1.5195,3.0457,4.5703,2.0987,4.6319,0.1116,3.3977,1.2354,0.795,1.1262,0.1499,0.0002,0.744,2.9568,2.0487,0.0004,1.8681,0.3659,3.2588,3.6598,1.5993,3.6157,4.121,0.7117,3.741,2.8936,2.6795,5.8977,2.8067,1.689,4.8577,2.3892,2.1925,2.7269,2.2356,3.6684,1.582,3.8843,2.8278,0.0554,0.2439,0.9542,0.0002,0.8359,2.7867,1.8658,4.6317,3.565,1.553,2.9466,4.2102,1.6826,0.788,2.2275,1.5398,1.9412,2.3018,1.6057,9.8675,2.9541,2.8703,2.7975,3.9155,0.0003,0.2062,3.0654,0.4835,0.7591,1.9231,1.284,4.5858,1.8522,1.2255,4.853,0.0155,0.5742,0.1082,0.0002,1.1095,1.4866,3.6694,5.209,3.4373,5.4593,5.3938,1.9906,2.625,0.6139,1.4912,0.4768,1.8745,4.9104,2.1973,3.4804,1.0841,1.6788,3.2866,2.6841,3.4105,0.0009,6.2753,4.2856,3.6726,1.9626,1.8851,3.4112,1.3589,2.3077,1.636,4.0898,0.6953,4.5054,2.3035,1.0934,3.4021,4.8885,2.6685,5.7619,3.2522,2.4278,3.177,1.1815,1.2671,1.2365,0.4889,0.4611,1.8906,0.0513,0.0039,0.2978,0.1799,0.0002,0.5424,3.4354,1.9663,2.01,5.1886,0.0003,5.306,5.0351,2.2037,0.9519,6.9251,0.4836,3.115,3.3104,4.031,1.1142,0.4881,6.629,5.6631,5.2618,1.269,1.9222,3.6028,4.4237,6.7094,2.4973,1.8064,0.8315,1.0516,4.5911,2.8196,0.799,0.95,1.6736,4.2383,3.2466,0.5158,0.3227,2.1801,1.0854,1.0531,4.0559,0.2638,3.889,3.2096,4.8171,1.3881,0.0297,0.3646,0.1052,0.0002,0.49,4.4031,5.2429,4.1034,4.9158,2.8101,1.0879,3.8818,4.374,3.1955,4.9564,1.8918,3.2535,1.1477,1.0385,2.9505,3.3793,0.4931,3.9645,6.1811,2.012,3.2957,0.4068,2.8733,0.076,2.1674,4.6728,0.0003,4.3525,4.0292,2.9437,3.1043,2.3974,5.4425,2.7275,0.0002,4.8153,2.923,3.1578,6.1549,3.4199,1.1588,1.1412,5.8917,2.459,2.5953,4.969,0.3978,1.5883,2.4436,2.4671,4.0922,6.5732,4.9933,4.7131,1.5875,1.6295,3.7803,3.1508,3.2183,1.4614,0.6363,2.6622,3.4029,2.2874,0.0002,2.0965,5.827,5.2239,3.3634,1.432,0.1838,3.9398,2.9649,3.3026,4.7955,2.3587,4.6966,4.5477,1.4013,1.6874,0.8065,2.7882,0.8228,1.4569,1.5717,4.5095,0.0045,2.5825,3.2699,1.0398,6.2562,3.7925,3.4762,2.68,1.5851,4.8025,1.6337,5.8127,0.036,5.3508,2.8786,0.6441,2.265,1.3343,2.5763,5.8885,0.9532,0.3917,0.0001,5.6524,0.8599,5.4013,4.9563,4.2452,0.8035,1.5433,2.9972,0.8989,4.2875,3.0402,0.4896,4.2434,5.3305,1.6191,2.128,1.1288,1.5552,0.0026,5.332,1.3242,0.328,1.3005,4.7017,5.0964,5.8141,0.0852,4.807,2.5269,5.178,0.3783,4.8775,5.4989,0.2197,1.0291,0.1698,0.0001,1.3458,4.3986,0.4791,5.5936,2.7692,0.6932,0.3031,6.9551,7.2887,4.7931,5.1109,2.9331,2.7699,1.3156,0.9833,0.8876,5.1824,2.8489,4.5671,0.0032,2.5754,3.4845,4.5131,0.8083,1.0713,4.2279,5.3214,2.4877,1.8307,2.0487,1.1657,0.1365,0.0001,1.9546,0.0368,0.0003,0.0005,1.0155,1.1958,0.0528,2.9741,4.4073,0.5911,2.2542,1.9217,0.448,3.8985,3.0412,5.138,3.9756,2.2446,1.9651,2.2527,0.293,1.4031,0.7061,1.3546,1.2601,0.0002,0.0358,5.1956,4.1952,5.7246,2.3528,2.7753,1.2603,4.9188,2.755,0.0046,2.304,1.8002,0.8087,0.0012,4.7848,2.4664,2.0097,4.6449,1.4827,2.193,1.4324,6.0832,2.8198,3.5624,4.3834,2.8058,4.7993,0.3366,4.6247,0.4177,1.6038,2.7135,0.0775,5.4955,1.456,1.487,2.7237,2.3059,3.8077,5.6595,1.7959,2.8221,2.493,5.2585,2.0936,1.2233,1.713,2.4446,5.329,1.4531,1.5208,3.4431,0.9827,0.0316,0.0002,4.3125,0.1981,1.707,0.0459,0.0005,0.0006,3.0522,3.8238,3.5194,0.9627,4.9304,0.4077,0.5103,4.0226,2.3479,0.1649,0.0002,3.5662,0.1152,0.0008,0.0005,2.6071,0.3702,0.7778,2.6897,1.8338,2.6326,4.4148,1.5017,0.1834,2.774,2.7417,5.7765,5.7456,2.3252,4.7423,1.0156,3.0488,1.1399,5.1257,2.2822,4.0742,4.1989,3.4521,2.6575,5.2309,2.7401,1.6957,1.3782,0.7428,3.5702,0.0895,3.3572,0.9943,0.764,2.5668,1.2833,3.3988,0.0782,0.7755,0.0641,0.0002,1.1192,1.1961,0.227,0.0051,4.3908,5.2851,5.0925,0.5134,1.893,3.5735,0.2647,2.3032,1.5277,5.4589,1.8197,0.851,6.4036,2.4062,1.676,1.2414,1.921,0.0087,1.6085]}

The cops just didn't think they were coming. They were still waiting for us.\"\n\nWhen he tried to explain that this wasn't just an odd encounter with two black suspects, who were shot multiple times, he said, they were talking about police brutality.\n\n\"Oh, they were scared.

And at the very least, that I am paying that money is that my life is saved... We won't go under the covers, because we will not be killed. The only thing that will save us is one big mistake. And that is why, if you know what I mean, we have something that we, you know... to do... the only way you can save your life isn't with some kind of illegal arrest on a white person, but with the help of our friends.... That is the only way that we will succeed if they just go on the streets... but.. I really want to go over there and get this book. I really want to go up there. I really want to see people standing in the cold... and then we will have one of these policemen that would never harm a black person, to take our picture \u2014 that would only show us two white cops, all white. But that is the only way that there was ever a police officer who cared enough to hurt people.\"\n\nAt this point, he concluded, \"the only way that you will ever get paid is if you are really brave,

{"id":182,"ended":false,"length":625,"gen_text":"what is your favorite prompt you've written? post it here with the prompt that inspired it.\n\nIf your prompt is something entirely similar to the one in the previous post, simply use it as a placeholder for the name of the prompt.\n\nIf you write in a word, a character, a pattern using an array, a string, or anything else without specifying the exact name and placeholders, just create an empty blank text box and paste it where it fits. Again, it works but you're not likely to see the full output. This example will use all of the default text that exists but I will never use any for any more than a simple, small note. A normal example:\n\nvar p: string; var p1, p2: string;\n\nAgain, you can use any code editor (e.g. Bash, Markdown, and some other formats) to change, add to, and change anything you want to say.\n\nHow do you use the default text box? This might be the difference in how you interpret and use the box. You can use a set of keys such as p2, p3, p4 or p5 (if you want more help), but you'll need to have the box set on the right hand side of the keyboard.\n\nAfter you write, place the text inside the p box. Just make sure the key you're using is on the right hand side instead. The key is called p and can be any of these:\n\nvar q: string; var h: string; var p;\n\nNote that, by default, the text is set inside a space so, for this instance, we would like to use a space separator between the '<' and '<2' prefixes:\n\nvar l: string; var q: string; var h: string;\n\nThis avoids having two separate sets of text where the code changes. If you want to change the code, just do that first. Note: we have used a space, not a \"^\" to indicate a single space rather than three separated spaces.\n\nIt will take some time to write any new value you wish, but after doing that you will be able to type code from within the code editor that you copied and placed in the p box.\n\nNote that the text box is really only useful to control the text you write. It isn't always quite right. If you need some more flexibility, you can use the text boxes themselves.\n\nIf you run into any problems that need tweaking, e.g., writing to disk or something, or want to show a different version of code all over the screen, or just want to have a simple guide to fixing a bug, just edit the text file with Ctrl+x. If you do this before writing the code, it will make things a little better but it won't really make your code the same by default.\n\nI hope I gave you some guidance on using this as an example of how to modify your code (including its default setting) and how to edit your code properly. If you would like input from me and have feedback for further examples, please send a PM to me using the contact page.\n\nThanks!\n\nAdvertisements","token_len":672,"entropy":[3.5125,2.8994,1.6633,10.7491,3.9789,1.1805,4.5688,1.3162,10.4831,1.5373,1.0804,5.3604,1.2226,6.7307,4.4254,3.9641,0.2878,0.732,1.068,0.0067,3.5623,3.5645,1.1078,0.9153,3.5483,6.3848,5.4414,0.4249,1.6834,0.5095,2.5202,1.2185,3.0056,1.4162,0.1805,5.8361,3.2994,2.8873,2.6869,0.9819,3.8385,1.6567,1.3141,4.4444,0.658,0.6105,1.1452,1.0313,0.9394,0.0002,2.4927,0.6402,5.0401,3.3346,1.0876,4.9883,1.4841,4.9318,3.9314,0.399,1.6631,4.0614,8.0342,3.2107,4.045,1.0345,2.0033,2.6466,0.46,0.994,3.2645,0.3314,4.6567,3.4305,1.7387,4.5461,1.9724,4.4544,3.8915,0.2279,0.5577,4.1713,4.2148,2.042,1.1499,3.991,5.4158,1.5935,1.9308,3.1987,0.6522,6.3414,1.6488,4.2442,1.2743,6.4073,0.0889,3.0645,3.9453,5.5022,2.2646,3.365,2.1898,4.3648,0.0141,2.1707,2.4888,3.2617,3.7494,0.8068,5.1168,4.1201,2.3152,3.0839,4.4048,0.9254,0.6021,4.6603,3.1003,3.5508,3.7648,4.2256,4.2443,2.7046,5.7293,1.3733,2.0729,5.57,2.1648,3.8724,0.8459,2.2647,4.2565,4.541,4.3644,5.5385,0.7128,6.6009,5.3038,5.211,3.0232,0.3237,0.0002,5.6841,4.1585,4.7174,3.3076,1.7273,1.5591,2.1257,2.1712,4.1452,0.1511,0.0131,1.0552,0.1625,0.0423,2.4629,0.0002,5.7026,0.1755,1.9828,0.997,1.4214,1.2638,5.7835,5.0471,3.2207,2.9812,0.0011,0.0002,0.4141,4.6398,0.7956,5.2012,0.0043,0.1988,4.6908,4.4061,1.0892,5.5162,0.4402,1.1691,4.6129,5.7993,2.2661,2.6265,0.1424,1.8752,3.6113,4.1077,1.4523,0.8011,2.1431,4.2971,0.7002,0.7686,0.0001,4.718,1.5356,1.4504,2.5828,1.9017,3.5669,1.5442,1.8677,0.9655,5.1505,4.8931,0.9311,2.1895,5.8312,3.775,1.6738,0.7318,5.2951,4.3792,1.559,0.7653,4.5439,0.5642,3.3226,0.7521,1.3022,2.2584,5.617,0.1012,5.5631,4.164,0.0085,5.2908,2.8215,1.2782,0.3343,0.6772,0.1197,0.6348,0.0721,3.1458,0.8228,0.0656,2.9513,3.8483,0.4644,1.9712,3.6528,5.4063,3.7941,1.9483,1.4599,3.1218,1.1851,0.2646,3.9769,1.7652,2.6692,1.3786,4.3881,2.3823,3.2566,1.7393,0.0403,0.4171,0.6433,2.3808,0.815,1.0318,0.0001,5.7199,0.7394,4.5671,2.7739,4.6256,0.8978,1.4144,3.0049,0.5752,6.0587,0.8307,1.2161,5.5426,2.7166,0.0487,2.0294,3.8137,1.2953,1.4309,0.7878,0.9823,1.6375,0.3063,1.1488,0.77,0.0529,6.5314,3.4481,3.3732,2.3359,3.1405,3.9024,2.5774,2.3398,3.3825,0.3024,1.6228,1.8634,3.6462,1.2978,0.4613,0.0001,4.3294,5.9169,0.2996,0.3736,0.0785,1.0078,5.5698,0.4563,0.1633,0.0462,0.9794,1.9398,5.1143,0.8487,0.0002,3.3475,0.6707,4.8538,4.0201,0.098,0.0989,0.7655,1.945,2.4389,2.1796,3.9154,2.4152,4.2198,4.3268,3.929,1.3863,3.1973,5.5946,0.0572,3.4505,4.1847,2.9388,0.4803,1.7388,1.2466,1.6644,5.2154,0.0007,2.8123,0.6198,4.8854,4.5251,0.1247,0.3084,0.4338,1.9339,3.5151,0.8142,4.4608,0.1338,3.2184,0.2315,0.0002,0.5962,4.9745,0.1704,0.2128,0.0339,0.309,2.9057,0.5384,0.035,0.0062,0.4088,0.5527,0.0035,0.0042,0.0476,0.5289,0.0002,2.7143,6.0596,2.9555,5.4855,3.3657,5.2158,0.0264,2.6824,6.0906,1.5175,5.4517,5.2058,1.1137,3.0013,0.289,1.6207,0.4298,1.9851,0.8752,3.4057,2.2031,1.5523,3.9715,3.2091,3.2173,0.7599,5.2931,3.5885,4.9524,3.366,3.7916,2.0186,1.7004,4.5119,1.2219,0.2462,4.8323,5.1639,0.5399,2.0817,2.6949,1.7374,3.6605,2.3037,6.0947,0.0119,4.74,5.0099,0.7167,0.6427,0.5868,0.0001,4.9318,3.7246,2.4956,1.4323,0.4827,0.7223,2.5304,5.0801,2.9847,6.8377,3.8243,4.5122,2.0398,0.9959,4.1393,4.0915,2.0897,2.3797,1.8225,1.2779,0.4494,0.0052,3.2757,5.3077,3.8833,2.8665,0.2531,3.8322,1.1811,2.9036,1.0341,5.5075,2.8201,3.8551,1.4283,0.3319,1.2977,0.0451,0.3001,0.8928,0.0001,3.3864,0.8714,2.3398,2.7116,1.5703,1.5305,4.7192,1.69,2.5006,2.5413,5.1275,1.3612,2.026,2.2365,2.473,0.8732,1.6462,3.91,0.0006,3.9344,5.9069,2.1882,1.9879,2.4743,0.268,3.2027,3.8279,2.9172,3.5286,0.5054,0.7315,0.2527,1.301,1.0597,3.2118,3.3884,3.4508,1.2464,0.9409,0.0001,2.7679,0.2331,5.9953,0.5064,1.0763,1.2713,4.4233,3.1355,5.3906,0.379,6.1515,0.002,0.0003,1.7946,4.4718,2.739,6.2008,1.516,4.8633,1.5483,2.5206,3.0933,0.1881,5.2594,1.9877,3.5186,2.2306,0.1596,4.0666,6.081,1.5078,0.9002,4.0368,0.283,3.163,1.4361,0.5743,0.23,3.7267,1.0883,3.9423,5.1917,0.8033,5.436,2.1111,1.7361,0.4879,2.5351,3.9606,0.4987,2.3322,4.498,3.4595,4.0449,0.65,5.1064,1.6898,3.7707,0.34,3.7998,1.6061,4.1661,1.9712,2.0796,0.9183,0.3858,1.7896,0.8007,2.947,2.7186,1.3244,1.0866,4.2698,3.4398,1.5105,1.076,0.0006,3.266,2.5041,2.5969,0.7044,5.4545,1.3049,6.8962,1.8539,0.1361,0.4673,0.0002,3.8972,2.0579,3.7048,4.7889,0.124,0.9849,4.7541,0.7819,2.7562,2.4952,4.3099,1.9978,0.4749,1.8925,0.8327,0.427,5.0967,2.0182,0.7698,5.1769,4.5212,5.2992,3.3977,5.14,1.868,1.4095,1.6608,0.2206,4.3328,1.9711,0.7267,5.5994,0.4383,1.6284,0.1781,3.598,0.0371,7.9366,1.7219,0.951,3.499,3.161,2.4954,3.8357,3.5191,4.3751,0.4702,1.0043,2.6295,3.3041,2.2046,1.2249,1.4555,3.0186,0.3755,2.8677,1.8663,1.2033,0.7711,0.0002,2.9025,1.528,0.6075,0.0002,4.7509]}

{"id":894,"ended":true,"length":640,"gen_text":"Some people collect stamps. Others, coins. You collect something far stranger. Other people collect stamps that are for sale to those people. You can earn something to keep them in business with them. You can also take away those items you earn.\n\nThere is a new version of America's Greatest Stamp Collectors.\n\nCollecters are called 'Collectors and Collector's Associations.\n\nCollectors and collectors have much less clout than you might guess. Collectors were actually the original distributors of stamps issued by the nation's biggest newspaper, Time magazine. There are a variety of reasons for why they were sent to collect stamps:\n\nThey were used to carry them through an area or department clerk's office. As a collectors' association, you can get away with it if you show your cards, because they can be used to make your work easier and cheaper than you can get them on credit cards and other forms.\n\n. As a collectors' association, you can get away with it if you show your cards, because they can be used to make your work easier and cheaper than you can get them on credit cards and other forms. They were never meant to be used as a political tool, instead simply as collectors' tools, which will save you money.\n\n, instead simply as collectors' tools, which will save you money. They are made from precious materials that don't work the same way over and over. When a collectable ends as they did, or you stop buying stamps, the collection will cease.\n\n, instead of doing something you thought you owned you get something, then you can return it. If a collection stops after your dollar amount has returned, then your dollar amount is gone, so all you'll get is the money.\n\nor. Any time, just before you begin to take away a collection of stamps, ask someone who you knew to stop selling. The answer will often be someone you know and never even saw, so don't ask them any questions. Most of the time, when you want to buy a record collector from one of your friends, the only way you can turn away a record collector is if you sell something without even seeing you, or you have seen one but don't want to spend your money on it. If you sell a record, that just means you're now looking at it over and over and over again.\n\n. Even if you don't know who you are, it means you're no longer a collector of this nation's best, oldest and best-known stamps.\n\nSome people want to keep these records of history, to record our progress \u2014 to make it more difficult to lose. Other people want to keep them for the sake of other people's records.\n\nSo don't sell this to someone you love, sell this to someone who doesn't want the record, buy that record from somebody who doesn't want it and never return it in the future, because that would set a terrible precedent. (This is why it's so important to remember how well history works, and keep it in the future.)\n\nIf you have some time, it would be perfect for you to hold on for a while to see whether history gets your way.\n\nAnd if it fails to make it, buy some back when it will.","token_len":675,"entropy":[5.3439,9.7749,7.0062,3.1915,3.6144,3.3021,10.1118,2.3169,4.3822,4.174,5.7579,8.3222,7.1237,1.3673,6.9833,0.2248,0.7785,1.5224,4.6193,1.5947,5.6808,1.3746,3.3396,3.8202,3.569,1.0143,2.3639,3.513,6.0557,3.7949,3.2628,3.86,1.8332,3.0067,3.8366,4.4368,3.7137,0.4865,1.5931,0.6497,4.5216,4.4889,3.1979,4.6792,4.8082,2.5951,4.3164,1.8117,1.4506,0.0031,3.6211,1.6596,1.3371,5.1021,5.2599,0.1861,6.006,0.9674,3.7653,3.2972,3.0284,1.3862,2.5996,2.1857,0.0002,5.3983,4.1628,2.2615,5.8888,4.659,3.6167,0.1335,4.2592,5.3932,0.3063,3.1684,0.0014,4.2613,1.9789,0.0002,2.1061,0.1392,2.3318,1.0432,2.7548,6.0138,5.425,4.2391,1.128,3.4388,0.8643,4.906,0.2479,3.9405,0.0929,5.8663,5.016,2.6036,3.6901,5.9835,0.5529,0.9659,6.413,0.6688,0.4404,5.4206,0.1551,3.8142,3.696,1.7495,6.2781,2.6394,0.6653,4.8139,1.2378,3.3444,3.6591,0.0077,4.8382,1.3011,3.731,2.2775,1.9814,5.0998,0.614,2.7525,0.9823,2.4522,0.8686,0.0002,1.6942,0.8424,3.0309,1.2679,4.1733,4.3942,4.1079,4.9325,3.5627,3.5499,5.2372,6.0699,0.7085,0.4205,1.011,5.1769,1.4533,5.6689,0.6137,0.6173,0.2235,2.0071,1.8248,2.8519,5.2162,0.023,3.0419,2.6538,0.2363,5.6084,2.5233,3.6963,2.9003,4.5237,1.9443,3.1696,0.9481,1.6534,0.9101,3.4748,3.0835,3.7429,2.0695,2.5639,3.3069,3.9615,2.2169,2.6582,1.5591,2.3621,3.4621,4.1013,1.098,3.2196,2.1632,1.7892,0.9972,0.6775,0.0002,7.4409,1.2091,0.0063,0.0089,0.0006,0.0012,0.0004,0.0016,0.0023,0.0005,0.0007,0.0008,0.0006,0.0015,0.0014,0.0031,0.0006,0.0031,0.0005,0.0018,0.0016,0.0021,0.0033,0.0003,0.0005,0.0015,0.0009,0.0003,0.0055,0.0007,0.0009,0.004,0.0021,0.0023,0.0013,0.0008,0.002,0.0008,0.0024,0.0016,0.0005,0.0016,0.0009,1.0197,0.4983,5.0396,3.6719,0.3794,0.3981,1.0477,1.9324,0.9445,5.7331,1.2948,2.3512,5.162,3.8666,1.4483,3.4171,0.4368,1.4229,3.0861,3.0059,5.2765,4.6388,0.6787,0.875,1.2834,0.6643,0.0002,5.7747,0.0076,0.0144,0.001,0.01,0.0007,0.0014,0.0009,0.0025,0.002,0.0126,0.002,0.0012,0.0011,1.3907,2.2402,4.3507,2.2122,5.8473,4.6117,1.8625,4.4784,0.0007,5.6561,4.5603,1.7059,0.1158,6.8438,0.4944,0.005,1.418,4.3191,2.723,4.5224,2.8124,5.2379,7.5042,4.6613,3.1555,0.7182,4.9006,2.7004,5.3936,3.168,2.3162,0.7218,2.0941,4.7324,1.8178,3.7192,1.4018,0.8411,0.0002,7.2053,0.5574,0.1401,4.7681,2.5134,2.7199,4.6108,1.7401,5.9911,4.1793,3.7247,2.7137,4.7956,5.1072,1.2723,2.2667,3.7056,0.3109,1.353,3.4632,3.3113,3.4612,3.8551,4.1952,4.3803,5.51,1.0391,1.8518,5.7326,0.8589,2.3484,3.4696,2.2387,0.7734,1.5538,1.8339,2.0067,2.7551,5.2015,0.9917,4.4868,1.7875,0.2825,1.7268,3.6094,1.5607,0.5838,0.0002,5.318,5.7301,5.8853,2.1162,4.8587,5.0827,5.3818,0.8438,4.7156,1.5601,4.1551,4.1763,1.8824,2.7398,2.7228,0.2802,0.3824,4.0698,4.1115,2.1185,3.2709,4.4899,1.8961,3.47,3.6407,3.669,3.4316,2.6114,1.7905,3.861,0.2334,3.2833,1.478,0.9268,2.5683,5.5557,5.0479,2.8184,2.2532,2.3639,2.4586,0.0003,1.5825,1.1683,5.8223,0.2726,0.5901,4.7471,2.1186,0.4526,0.298,0.3973,3.974,0.5711,4.8681,0.3347,2.4051,1.0761,5.0154,6.7359,5.8791,4.147,0.1945,2.0894,1.1322,0.3484,3.5276,2.5689,1.117,1.1528,0.7275,6.069,4.0253,2.318,0.8523,0.3271,0.2959,0.7994,0.6476,4.424,4.5348,5.963,4.2312,3.6078,6.181,2.4237,1.4513,2.5509,3.2463,4.8161,3.3036,4.7166,1.9518,0.0005,0.8925,0.139,4.6949,2.1989,0.5427,1.0526,0.5347,0.372,2.836,0.3023,2.9221,1.44,0.6717,1.5132,4.0947,5.9216,0.3381,0.6098,2.2255,5.6011,4.1199,1.0132,3.7664,5.0546,0.1177,0.0024,2.2101,0.7406,0.4222,0.7775,1.041,0.0002,5.2341,4.283,0.6322,0.2396,1.6342,0.0006,1.9936,1.4317,1.2951,0.6639,0.6316,2.9584,4.3553,0.5389,1.5982,3.6559,0.0496,2.719,0.4016,2.9829,5.6399,5.7725,0.0837,3.1525,3.2235,4.9603,1.1212,2.1019,1.1143,1.3096,1.0306,0.2839,1.0549,0.0002,4.6069,1.4928,4.6746,0.3614,2.9286,3.4647,3.8681,3.9337,3.9316,1.4986,3.731,4.8534,5.9909,4.5465,6.9025,2.8341,3.0661,1.7946,2.2235,4.501,1.5221,3.9737,2.0493,5.0106,0.0966,0.2957,0.239,0.9755,1.8561,1.1864,2.3009,2.2325,0.0023,4.637,0.1812,1.3132,2.5054,0.6344,0.9875,0.0002,3.43,4.7414,0.0007,4.0178,3.6971,2.8069,2.2763,1.8995,3.9258,1.5407,6.5316,1.3928,0.3571,0.4631,1.006,2.7501,0.0006,1.8231,3.9499,2.5324,2.3183,3.8612,4.1553,0.5546,2.0592,2.175,0.4533,1.327,0.0007,0.4654,1.1476,3.1204,4.0335,3.5911,0.0891,6.0884,1.5556,0.662,1.6213,2.3815,1.6347,2.7614,5.819,1.6563,1.7813,0.4542,0.9996,5.4492,3.6755,0.7214,2.0846,2.6914,0.482,1.1965,0.6265,0.4125,2.6244,4.4276,5.6312,3.9854,1.0046,1.5724,1.2463,4.2957,1.2152,1.8362,2.0018,3.7124,1.3493,0.2884,0.0002,2.7764,0.2179,2.7756,4.265,3.7276,1.0614,4.1913,3.4913,0.1391,6.1682,2.1346,0.1781,0.1877,5.1161,2.6255,4.0838,1.3059,1.5503,1.8871,2.1761,4.5257,6.618,3.9259,5.805,1.498,0.6005,1.4358,0.0002,3.873,1.0766,1.654,5.9193,2.0881,3.5944,1.4243,1.6985,4.8993,2.6937,5.7651,4.8591,1.1534,4.6737,0.5563]}
{"id":4880,"ended":true,"length":648,"gen_text":"Everybody in the world switches bodies with a random person... and one that has the same body as him, who can't fit inside his own body... then he can feel sorry for those people.\n\n\"But I'm not a hero, and I think that's okay.\n\n\"I saw [that] after [the killing of] a man by a knife and the stabbing he had where he looked at the other people and said 'This happens to anybody, you have to go to the police, or die alone,'\" he said.\n\nRead more on CBC Power's Global Affairs page.\n\nNDP MP Mark Blaney says he doesn't want people to know what a hero is.\n\n\"I don't think that makes any sense,\" Blaney told CBC Radio's Power & Politics. He said the new laws will be applied on everyone, regardless of whether they are about the public's safety or safety safety of their friends or family... \"I'm not worried about any of our neighbours. I feel confident that those who have fallen, like I did, can be safely and responsibly treated. No one needs to fear being the victim of one of those acts, whether they're the public safety commissioner, the police officer or anyone who is working with their peers, working in the community, and they need to know what we're doing and what they're doing in response.\"\n\nIn the video, the man can be heard trying to convince the camera to shoot him, then making threatening language about getting an \"emotion permit\" allowing himself and his friends to go to hospital without a trial and in a group photo \"without having to be there.\"\n\nThe man in the video apparently didn't know that what he was doing is illegal. He doesn't even call for a trial. He just wants someone to know about it.\n\nBlaney says there is no need to be terrified when you are going through this, but you know what could be possible?\n\n\"There's going to be some risk to law-abiding people taking their lives because they're not a good or ethical person. So we do want people to know what is safe for them and what is not,\" he said.\n\nBlaney said he isn't concerned that the new laws will be used to cover up sexual assaults and to cover up deaths over the course of a homicide. He is worried they, too, could help some of the wounded people who are currently living in hospital.\n\nThe Liberal MP has been talking on his cellphone about these changes for more than a month. On Wednesday he spoke to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, the human rights organization that has been monitoring his cellphone calls and other personal information, and he also spoke with the Toronto Star. A report released on Wednesday concluded the changes to the death penalty are needed, and no new law will be brought in until there are no more attacks by women, no more rapes, no more \"the killing of people in public areas.\"\n\nThere are two problems with this latest change. First, there are no new statutes for the changes to cover the deaths of people killed by guns. Second, the new laws are not being applied nationwide.\n\nBlaney has also called for a ban on riding in motor vehicles. He hopes that is accomplished by the end of this year.","token_len":677,"entropy":[3.7836,1.2646,2.3862,13.9071,6.6665,3.2018,2.6007,6.3181,2.591,5.83,2.9363,5.3643,4.483,3.0795,2.839,1.7482,3.3189,2.0019,3.6082,2.4718,3.4621,3.3389,1.8006,5.6253,3.7434,2.3408,2.0834,0.232,2.88,4.5994,2.0593,2.5919,5.8421,5.8965,0.0277,4.111,1.7511,1.9825,2.1717,0.0414,2.7094,2.9582,2.7783,1.9359,1.0324,2.6147,4.5464,1.8009,2.2092,0.7071,4.3992,1.671,1.3341,4.2782,0.9243,3.0964,0.0005,0.1843,1.3342,6.1419,6.6394,4.1672,0.9988,5.7499,4.3508,1.8648,5.5744,1.6336,1.4456,3.2029,3.4536,2.4629,0.7718,6.0481,2.6505,3.0128,5.0021,5.3221,2.2545,6.7753,0.6303,5.5761,2.2046,1.7963,3.9577,2.5059,1.4025,0.8809,1.4481,4.4429,6.1939,0.9141,4.0851,1.5325,2.9629,3.5663,0.2998,3.2853,1.7978,1.5774,1.4566,2.0305,3.8483,3.673,4.9871,3.8993,1.3421,1.0016,0.1352,0.4556,0.0003,5.4042,0.7753,3.5215,5.0163,6.9872,0.5488,5.247,2.942,2.0773,0.5805,1.2236,0.0002,5.0958,2.4462,1.982,5.4199,4.06,0.1992,1.7083,2.0911,3.1502,0.0006,2.1367,3.5416,0.6713,2.9904,2.2458,4.0627,2.3667,0.5442,1.0195,0.6968,0.0002,0.3644,1.2006,1.5243,0.0006,1.4839,2.0387,5.7286,2.4171,0.1436,1.6412,0.6447,0.0003,1.2058,0.5729,1.8777,0.1749,0.6901,0.3657,0.0013,0.6673,5.0149,0.9636,1.8157,5.5943,3.4553,2.123,2.6874,3.342,4.0918,4.7166,1.6461,2.0112,0.0139,2.9791,0.6844,1.8993,5.6105,2.9534,4.4609,3.057,0.8409,0.4417,3.2297,6.7552,0.2588,2.7733,4.1006,1.0877,0.845,5.5222,2.6006,1.5257,2.247,0.8982,4.3362,0.1296,4.0552,0.5689,4.2517,2.8695,2.5548,0.3521,5.3788,4.5192,0.7791,4.346,1.3221,2.4223,6.0357,3.9855,5.097,3.2039,1.5857,0.4694,3.6409,2.4126,3.7742,1.9774,3.3455,2.0028,2.1024,5.9704,0.599,3.7885,0.2454,2.9775,3.6333,4.9388,1.3627,0.3704,5.6588,0.6216,0.8051,3.1786,2.6117,3.7046,1.4845,1.1161,3.5295,3.947,2.8945,3.6743,1.4661,0.9402,1.2201,2.0295,1.1579,2.9316,2.4146,1.9219,5.0511,1.6292,5.2058,4.6502,2.6005,5.8882,2.5403,1.4669,0.5936,1.762,3.263,2.8207,3.4238,0.167,2.193,2.0811,4.0148,0.8729,0.7016,2.3393,1.2668,3.5171,0.7845,0.3789,3.1505,3.8266,1.1706,0.1305,0.0003,3.7648,2.0395,4.3428,0.46,2.2408,1.9982,2.6121,0.0594,0.4222,5.4847,0.0602,3.9602,1.2587,2.8092,1.1045,3.3647,0.6173,1.7118,3.6476,5.3588,4.5186,5.6484,2.3577,4.6896,4.0745,3.7414,5.4285,2.5503,5.7041,0.5163,6.697,6.8281,2.4756,1.2348,1.2314,0.2943,3.4146,1.3042,3.4742,3.1532,2.7322,4.95,3.5851,4.8092,1.8937,5.388,4.279,6.3203,4.1253,3.0188,0.2333,2.6164,2.5488,1.5029,0.323,0.0002,1.8237,1.3917,3.4331,0.2415,0.6552,5.0991,3.3635,0.0004,1.5931,1.9746,4.4552,0.4189,0.4042,0.5906,4.5229,1.1181,1.2855,2.237,4.1797,0.0006,1.9088,5.1536,3.1075,1.6664,1.4074,0.8447,2.4359,1.9971,2.4034,3.9182,0.2474,2.2357,3.2885,1.0978,0.6309,0.5905,0.0002,2.317,0.005,1.6073,3.1094,1.4271,1.1366,2.3343,0.7213,2.4135,5.9428,3.6368,2.8303,1.9788,4.406,1.5483,2.4283,2.3508,2.3496,5.2388,4.1127,1.2676,6.2582,1.865,5.3838,1.0047,1.2637,0.0002,0.4896,3.2055,1.221,4.0243,0.0016,0.0311,2.4172,5.7159,2.6845,5.5593,2.1031,0.0101,1.4953,5.7346,1.8014,1.062,2.7274,1.7603,1.3847,2.1343,3.981,3.1636,3.6702,4.4425,0.3423,1.5825,3.6159,2.4754,4.6689,2.2615,1.707,0.1379,0.5204,1.2233,3.0959,4.5324,1.9495,0.324,1.607,0.6202,0.533,0.2549,1.8284,0.4697,0.0924,0.0545,0.6328,0.0002,2.0535,0.0022,1.6478,1.3523,5.0563,0.0006,2.4154,2.4047,1.7984,0.7498,0.5005,0.7449,2.1014,1.347,0.8626,4.161,1.6616,5.6501,1.469,3.1081,4.5666,2.7285,0.2338,5.3267,6.7446,1.1787,1.8507,0.0005,0.5171,5.0425,0.4101,2.49,4.2883,2.3787,3.8695,7.7081,0.457,0.0326,1.0612,4.7169,4.506,1.3913,0.7485,4.6384,2.7059,1.0473,1.4159,5.4189,3.9918,0.9771,1.8178,0.7306,0.2493,0.0002,2.8227,4.8203,1.4549,3.5494,1.6939,4.1655,5.3211,3.557,1.6183,1.0671,4.7489,2.5656,1.3103,3.3258,0.001,0.6105,1.6575,0.8975,4.0324,2.0284,1.8177,3.0125,1.2113,2.2365,3.16,3.9196,0.1199,0.1727,1.6779,2.5613,3.7298,0.0162,2.1026,0.8685,2.5269,1.1027,3.067,2.2872,1.9877,1.2775,2.016,3.3047,2.9565,0.7609,2.3019,0.8865,2.2726,4.2926,1.485,1.5909,1.4181,3.812,1.3427,0.8075,6.4626,4.4019,1.6544,2.3535,1.0056,5.4511,1.7458,2.0206,2.7984,0.4365,5.0643,0.1465,1.7907,3.6533,2.1554,1.1047,5.9125,3.2505,3.3482,1.4764,0.1956,4.2303,0.5366,2.0526,4.0027,1.1583,2.6492,0.9766,5.8528,4.2767,3.797,2.8133,5.1912,0.2007,2.2974,1.2283,0.7141,0.0204,5.119,5.4041,3.8961,0.2153,2.2469,2.6717,1.2227,4.8792,1.5386,0.4075,0.0003,4.8153,1.2742,3.7782,4.4827,0.1776,1.8479,5.1813,2.6269,0.9533,0.7343,0.1206,2.526,1.2708,1.3179,1.5894,5.4042,2.6014,1.6011,4.7127,1.5127,4.4202,2.4076,2.9632,0.3387,1.2706,3.5335,1.1236,2.8214,0.8724,1.326,0.0053,1.326,2.1104,0.828,1.8033,2.121,3.4766,1.553,5.6102,0.6213,1.1899,0.0003,1.7052,0.0024,3.607,3.5022,3.5878,0.5534,1.5774,3.4519,0.026,6.1344,1.683,3.9586,0.729,1.9525,1.6833,5.3334,1.9138,4.1639,5.0113,1.4554,1.4682,0.8818,0.0016,1.5836,0.5893,0.6116]}
{"id":101,"ended":false,"length":628,"gen_text":"The guardian angel was thoroughly surprised when a demon mauled the assailant.\n\nHowever, that did not mean that she was invincible. The man who was shot in the temple was killed instantly and did not take any chances to resurrect, and that man had probably fallen a little short in the battle against the demon.\n\nHe was right \u2014 her power wasn't anything like the Devil.\n\nHe had a strong and powerful attack where he could attack from anywhere \u2014 he couldn't even make out any sound or sound \u2014 it was like the sound of a gunshot.\n\nA sound he had never heard before had killed him instantly!\n\nHe was one of the strongest priests in any city, so he was already close to the Dragon Cult master's place.\n\nIt wasn't like this was possible without the aid of the Devil Dragon's great power.\n\nA massive boulder had completely disappeared, and there was a huge pile of bones on the ground, so some of the bones were only a part of what was left.\n\nThat was really the first impression that came to mind.\n\nHowever, what had really alarmed him from that point on was the fact that the statue where the devil came from wasn't even a corpse.\n\nInstead, it was a corpse that had been partially eaten. At that moment, the demons inside the temple appeared to be having a moment of total paralysis, so they had to hold back a little more then as they had to protect the statue from the monsters.\n\nIn a way, it was because of that that the demons that fought against them, and only the devil would let them kill you.\n\nThis time, I should have been at my limit; the amount of time I was holding back wasn't that great.\n\nAnd, in fact, even that was not enough to make them so anxious.\n\nSo when I was holding back, the demon monster had finally killed one of the demons inside the shrine.\n\nBut that was because of me, so I used my control over not even the sword to block.\n\nI made three clones and gave them a little bit of time.\n\nThis time, you can feel the excitement of my sword attack. When you get close enough, the first phase should be at full attack.\n\nThe second phase is after 10 minutes, and I thought that this kind of power would be useful for taking out the weak.\n\nBut, I also knew that it would be a short amount of time before it was worth it if it could be done with good condition and not require more time to do it.\n\nI had to make two attacks.\n\nAs long as there were only two movements \u2014 there was no time to do any of those, which was not the case for everyone.\n\nI did not want the Devil to be able to inflict a short amount of damage like this, so I did the attack by using two different skill sets \u2014 I used the Demonic Focus of the Devil as my shield to protect my body from incoming attacks, then in the beginning, I used the Demon Spirit of the

{"id":4738,"ended":false,"length":646,"gen_text":"The adventures of a low-budget guild of assassins struggling to compete with bigger businesses... and one that has found true strength by making fun of the likes of Robert Downey Jr. and Will Smith for having the audacity to make fun of everyone involved in their work.\n\nThis could be the next big-screen action thriller. How do you feel about this coming-of-age movie?\n\nI love the idea of it. It's a little bit of both. In the movie scene, you have this young man who finds himself in a nightclub who can't get enough of the action because there's a lot of music playing... and there's some of that music you have to do. Then there's a large group trying to get a job, and he goes through some tough times, and they have a lot of really good people, and they're trying to get a real, fun job there. They're also trying to get a really, good relationship with the other female performers... and I think there's a lot of really good character development for this young man.\n\nAre there any scenes you'd like to see in this movie (and possibly a sequel where they might even re-cast the young adult characters)? (Hint: maybe they may not.)\n\nThe biggest one, we really wouldn't go this far at all. There is nothing I would take away from it. At this point, it seems like we are in the past three movies... but it's too early to tell if it will go that far.\n\nBut we have some great stuff. The film is about a group of young people who are trying to keep things going at the beginning; they're all in very bad ways \u2014 they're all trying to keep getting away, trying to find another job. At this point, that's just something the studio will work through. In other words, there will be one big shot with lots of good characters, some good fights, some really interesting scenes, and we want to get some good reaction from the audience at this point.\n\nIt would be great if the audience was like, I am absolutely right about this, you're not right about this, but we were just excited to see what happens next. If you had directed this movie that has a decent amount of action scenes that are interesting to watch (I think it's about 30-40 scenes), you would certainly welcome it. But you're missing out on a lot of what we felt that was the best movie.\n\nYou've said that there are two things we should look at to see if it plays to my tastes. The two things we should all focus on, right? (He also says there's three things we should look at to see \"next year,\" not including these ones) are the original idea that the team would have to make new movie and bring in a new makeup artist. Then in the end, we need to have a new actress in that group for the new movie, so we'll have to see if we could bring in another actress.\n\nDid you hear from some producers about that?

{"id":2791,"ended":false,"length":661,"gen_text":"A woman in an apartment visible from your window has been flirting with you for the past few months. Finally tonight she holds up a sign indicating her apartment #. Too bad this is a horror story and not a romance.\nBastard: My boyfriend is really into you, and while we're not his primary sexual partner, we've been having great sex and we enjoy each other's company together. This week he's coming up empty handed on the part of the woman who was once his sister before his first and is actually my best mate yet. I know that he might have some issues with her personality and it could be a problem for your relationship, but being my boyfriend you always love me, and I can't wait to be with you when I get back home. Love,\nSarah: She was the one who told me you were your boyfriend last night. As a gay woman trying to change her sexuality, it's really amazing how many amazing stories start out like this but change really fast from what it feels like to find out that it's not there at all. We've had so much sex and have so many different friends for so long now that I've learned that not everyone can change things and when it doesn't happen, it's hard to let go of.\nSheehee: So you were in a relationship already where the \"bad\" thing happened to your girlfriend, which turned out to be exactly the way it seemed. Now you're dating a guy with similar issues, and this could be your chance to start talking about your relationship and finding out what it's like instead.\nBastard: I know you're trying to convince me this one's real-life and he's right. It was a lot of fun and I have a happy relationship with both of our girls, so I'll tell you I won't lie at my worst when I say all in all I've written about I am glad that my boyfriend is my best mate. And that you will be my best mate so for now please just let go!\nHannah: Yes, it's one thing to try to make it last, and it's totally another thing altogether to try and have something happen at some point in your relationship. It's so much fun taking your partner with you around the city. This isn't what I've been talking about before, but it's absolutely my responsibility to convince you that is just what happens in your life now. So I hope that you start getting the message that it's over.\nAnd if you've read over this post you've probably decided to put yourself through it. Now you're thinking to yourself, If this are the story that's going to become out loud I'd like to take that as a warm kiss of encouragement, to encourage our families to support my friend who has two boys. Let all of these good boys live forever, so that there's enough time for everyone to figure things out.\nFor your love, Sarah Sarah,\nSarah, thank you for your email, but no thanks - I'm sorry for my

{"id":3177,"ended":false,"length":643,"gen_text":"An astronaut in the ISS realizes they are probably the last human alive, so they leave in a shuttlecraft to dock and then bring the other astronauts to safety because nobody will see them unless they are lucky enough to survive the trip, and that's really what it sounds like. The humans are on the ground.\n\nAnother person asks if astronauts should get married and say yes to it.\n\nA man comments about how it's weird to have two people on Earth but not even four.\n\nA man says it's pretty cool that all people who were raised this way could have a family on Earth and it's cool to see our children be such the way they were raised.\n\nA man asks if he can still see the moon while they're away in space.\n\nA little kid says they can.\n\nThe astronaut looks at the Moon and says 'I'm so sorry, there's so much here.' A kid says they have to keep doing that.\n\nA boy says he doesn't want to be a kid anymore and when he was 18, he asked his dad to let him go.\n\nA couple of astronauts are trying to get a photo of the planet to give the Apollo 12 crew members, which will take them to the orbiting lab.\n\nFinally...\n\nA couple asks if the Apollo 6 crew are on the planet.\n\nA couple of astronauts say they got two days to put on that video as they watched the Apollo 12 astronauts trying to get the camera to shoot.\n\nThere's more about that here.\n\nMore from The Wrap:\n\nThe Apollo crew had a rocky escape after their parachutes plunged off the Moon, causing the spacecraft to sink. But their capsule parachutes didn't drop as they could have if the astronauts had been standing up. On Wednesday, we interviewed one of Apollo 12's astronauts about why he was trying to get the video taken and told us about it when it was last put on public view during the first mission.\n\nA few guys want their own photographs after the video: And they want something the crew can share on the internet and see on their smartphones. So they do it, you can send it to their friends, put them in their place. But they'll give them a hard time and try to keep a low profile. And after 10 minutes of making out with them, they got together and had this funny moment when he took pictures, and he put them together and he put them together and then he said 'I want you. Do you want this?' And he said, yeah, of course I do.' Or something. One guy says the guys got together and just made a video, and they're not doing that anymore...\n\nThere's more about that here.\n\nA couple of astronauts say they are still trying to find the best way to see the moon - and if they are, they'll make it in the space lab by the End of June, just in time for their last manned spacewalk on that massive moon. On Wednesday (June 19), the astronauts and their two kids will be back in their space vehicle to take off from New Delhi on the last missions to see and land the next human on the moon -- two new astronauts who don't want to have a photo taken in space.\n\n(Via

{"id":4039,"ended":false,"length":643,"gen_text":"I was logged into the MMO when it happened. We still don't know what trapped us in there, or why things started to feel like reality instead of a game, but there's one thing I'm 100 % certain about : things would've gone a lot different if I hadn't been logged into my alt-account.\n\nI couldn't do something about that until yesterday, when I got to play for around 7 hours with all the things I'd been able to do in the short experience in the time it took me to get into the game.\n\n\"You know what I'm happy about?: [T]here are a lot of things going on right now, and I hope you'll all take it as a relief that it was actually you that got there, that you've gotten all these new items and that you've got a better understanding of how things work in the world, with your guild mates, with your friends online or your guilds on. As a group, we can change a lot, and it'll help some people but it also needs to change people, especially your parents, who got caught up in the idea that everyone can do something in a guild and the idea that you have to keep doing that.\n\n\"I think there might be some good things about being able to do it on your own as a group. I like that you can have a lot of your members there too, because we already started the process to give the guild some voice: I feel like the rest of the people feel like we can change the game without their meddling, because we already have this amazing community of players we're talking about.\"\n\nWormath in Warcraft 1, a new video game inspired by the game's world building mechanic, shows us what's happened at least in-game in WoW during the first half of season 1 and 2.

The video is called'Waking up at the bottom of the hill where the trolls are'with The Wormath, a new gameplay mechanic for the game that makes possible living in the wilderness, with a single purpose.\n\nThere's absolutely something for everyone at Wormath, especially its players that have never heard of it, even as you're not sure whether it's one of The Grim Flayer, one of the first dungeons in WoW and the first battle of the season. You may not ever fully understand what really goes down during the first half of the game. But it certainly feels, and you'll probably never forget it, for this in-game experience.\n\nWarcraft 2 is going to be on sale in early 2015 for about $30 on Steam at launch \u2014 the biggest ever for a game this big, for a whole brand new genre, for a whole new game system.

{"id":758,"ended":false,"length":635,"gen_text":"To protect people from what awakens at that hour, humans are programmed to be unable to be awake from 5 to 6 AM, save for a select few. You have just woken up at 5:01 AM, with a message saying `` Report to your local military base. Basic training begins now. ''\n\nHowever, that only explains part of what happened on Friday. The incident was not due to terrorist activities. Many people did feel safe and safe to follow through.\n\nThere is one key factor that could have done that. The first time that this was said to have happened after the 9\/11 attacks.\n\nIt is a very high priority for us to protect people from what awakens at that hour, humans are programmed to be unable to be awake from 5 to 6 AM, save for a select few. You have just woken up at 5:01 AM, with a message saying `` Report to your local military base. Basic training begins now. ''\n\nBut the truth is, most Americans won't notice it because they have grown used to seeing the clock, and the fact that it will go out, and there is so much information about the clock, that it will keep showing up.\n\nWe also have good reason to believe that when this number went out on October 9, 2001, some of the people who knew about the clock knew how to react (we were told they hadn't even asked us to give the date).\n\nThe first thing that can happen with the clock is that your mind is already \"accumulating information\" about something, and your body is too distracted to think.\n\nThat is what we saw with the clock that day as well, and we know that it will continue to go out for a long time, and that you will realize very quickly that you are not asleep and that you are not really experiencing anything you are not supposed to.\n\nBut if your mind is able to respond to the clock, we've already done something that will wake you up and remind you that you are not yet asleep.\n\nIf you can believe the clock will go out at any moment, just remember how this effect worked before with the clock, and that this is just what people will do.\n\nIn any event, if you want your body to stay focused during the day, even if you can turn the dial off or turn off your phone, do it. We're not going to allow you to turn off your clock and continue your life in the dark by listening to music, or playing a song, or talking to people over the internet.\n\nIn the end, it will not be a problem going back to sleep.\n\nAfter some time has passed, this information will be shared online and it will be reported to your family, friends, and coworkers and so on, and you will remember it. One of the things that has happened over and over again is we've discovered the power of what the clock knows.\n\nSo don't forget this simple message: \"Good luck tonight, and do not ask how the clock was on that day! \"You will always have a good life. \"\n\nRead by: David Denny, author of \"The Unsung Commandment: The Power of Awareness and Resistance\"\n\n[About This Video Player]\n\n[About This Video Player]","token_len":684,"entropy":[7.9452,4.621,0.9775,4.6968,12.9191,0.8463,6.3645,3.8507,5.4076,1.2028,8.3428,2.3255,4.7636,0.1526,2.8745,5.7627,0.0376,4.3637,4.9916,4.7807,6.9297,2.7418,3.0847,2.3654,1.9555,8.1237,0.3836,2.027,7.1126,0.0843,3.2974,5.4112,3.114,5.7746,6.7379,0.0059,0.2807,3.0255,1.4553,1.6433,3.8442,0.8623,1.3446,4.9109,2.1004,5.0863,3.244,10.6391,13.6941,1.8139,2.7001,4.2516,7.949,2.8902,1.7115,10.0177,2.6312,3.225,3.9177,0.9739,5.1481,1.9538,0.1202,5.2195,0.0735,4.0885,4.6056,5.1922,2.6432,0.0221,1.5895,2.2294,3.0279,4.5132,0.8769,2.2701,5.5151,2.1194,2.8728,5.8541,0.0206,6.2548,3.1428,1.6336,5.6908,2.2104,4.2474,6.6136,3.4698,2.3471,3.3305,4.5051,5.2455,2.6521,2.5879,1.5116,0.0003,3.9945,1.9309,3.5703,5.3998,2.8165,0.6987,3.1336,0.9315,5.872,2.017,0.9606,1.9008,4.4014,3.084,2.263,3.6574,3.2663,3.7937,1.4923,2.0148,0.4728,7.0976,1.4476,3.2968,0.108,0.0022,0.215,3.6562,2.1357,0.0001,3.0371,1.8524,2.835,2.9001,4.9344,3.0854,0.9059,2.4163,0.6123,2.5141,2.0831,0.2121,0.149,0.1062,0.0002,0.0036,0.0949,0.071,0.0864,0.086,0.0039,0.0071,0.001,0.0016,0.0279,0.0007,0.0038,0.0035,0.0037,0.0213,0.0087,0.0023,0.0013,0.0885,0.0576,0.0006,0.0021,0.0013,0.0008,0.041,0.2569,0.0116,0.0038,0.0065,0.0001,0.0003,0.0013,0.0015,0.0004,0.005,0.0011,0.004,0.0026,0.0033,0.0014,0.0046,0.0329,0.0542,0.0015,0.0027,0.0006,0.0046,0.0047,0.0025,0.0168,0.0016,0.0023,0.003,0.0037,0.2762,0.3337,0.0002,3.4009,2.5386,4.9131,0.238,1.4332,4.3673,2.7499,6.1436,0.0007,4.4677,2.7884,4.2113,1.016,2.7909,6.1805,2.0994,0.0016,3.0026,2.2987,5.0555,4.1855,1.8343,2.2254,3.9158,0.1723,1.3509,4.4398,3.5099,2.6288,4.6405,2.3911,4.5774,1.4094,3.9835,0.121,3.1352,2.6268,2.1067,3.3307,1.877,1.3029,1.7596,1.6791,4.8037,4.684,0.5753,1.4979,0.5799,0.0002,3.5483,3.8097,1.9891,6.2301,1.051,0.2739,1.3852,0.1364,4.7421,2.615,5.4787,3.7059,0.2322,3.295,5.4343,2.6793,1.2667,0.6505,0.1709,4.3854,1.6048,0.7888,1.8253,0.9045,3.4565,1.54,1.6132,0.87,2.7739,4.0192,0.6811,5.4397,6.037,5.2616,3.9109,1.3569,2.612,6.145,0.0017,4.094,5.4939,3.2088,1.2932,4.9388,3.0461,2.3825,1.1412,0.5997,0.0002,2.4695,3.6767,1.4225,1.1963,4.6656,1.2001,4.329,1.9643,1.1294,0.2343,0.5954,4.7821,2.7376,2.3628,4.4562,5.6923,4.9362,1.6973,0.3993,2.1261,1.1133,1.5085,3.535,2.1741,0.9721,2.5436,1.8272,0.8776,4.981,4.2555,0.4978,2.7396,1.8357,0.7176,0.0002,3.603,0.917,2.6324,3.1071,2.6966,2.75,0.6297,1.7024,4.1703,1.0757,5.6402,1.2641,2.2326,1.1606,2.3041,2.579,1.0565,1.916,1.4965,1.6373,0.3941,2.9098,0.1148,2.848,1.6038,1.4555,0.1461,1.8733,1.5266,1.5228,3.2723,0.6155,5.7868,5.5647,0.4796,0.5645,1.498,1.1399,1.0863,3.4653,3.1613,1.1995,0.9356,0.9254,1.4391,4.065,4.5292,1.5462,5.5091,2.7124,0.8959,1.5386,0.0017,0.7016,0.2198,0.0002,3.578,2.7871,3.354,0.8017,0.6745,5.7947,0.0048,5.0059,0.7994,1.3011,0.7851,0.6503,4.4598,5.9187,2.1352,4.7162,2.9657,1.7513,1.801,5.3449,0.7955,0.0945,2.5537,3.6265,0.0187,1.1656,0.4751,0.3703,0.5977,5.9059,2.0858,0.4535,0.3659,0.0002,2.9057,0.7095,3.3683,5.2022,3.0057,2.0341,2.5826,0.8549,0.0333,3.845,2.5641,1.8061,0.3333,5.3312,1.4847,3.977,4.1136,5.8401,3.0057,3.5923,6.5561,0.613,1.3779,1.8919,0.6697,2.1386,3.1758,1.6624,2.7662,2.5901,3.6105,3.4962,1.0006,1.8065,0.2843,0.0002,4.1016,4.1005,1.0849,0.0315,2.5151,0.4978,2.7555,3.6819,3.0999,0.1127,3.9007,2.2251,4.645,1.0256,1.2316,0.3099,5.3102,0.8314,0.7553,2.6587,6.6521,2.7236,3.174,2.0857,3.2558,1.1397,1.6633,1.2904,1.4299,0.6452,4.0074,1.3315,0.9881,4.9966,3.3485,1.5847,1.6598,0.0554,4.3533,1.0205,0.0541,2.3358,1.641,0.6213,4.4767,3.1059,5.1679,4.0283,1.567,3.2064,1.6239,1.037,4.9592,5.4213,0.0716,2.9507,1.7253,1.5472,3.9449,2.4572,2.9162,1.6227,0.2148,3.8646,0.648,3.0126,5.4888,0.2191,2.9662,0.409,0.3013,0.0002,4.2217,2.2023,1.2392,0.0694,2.3081,1.4938,3.1554,1.402,2.395,2.1384,6.6643,2.1946,0.3767,1.7127,1.0418,0.8159,0.0003,5.5735,5.8355,0.9158,4.0426,0.0778,0.338,4.2858,4.9152,0.4233,1.9168,4.8798,5.026,1.5274,3.3175,0.1293,1.2545,4.7138,0.5582,2.4796,3.014,1.1235,1.1299,0.2769,0.8781,2.5857,4.085,3.8454,0.3712,1.9297,0.8603,2.1669,0.2691,3.9425,2.4467,1.402,7.6033,1.544,0.178,1.4356,0.6395,3.5904,1.9698,3.325,2.2872,0.0057,0.4086,0.918,4.6616,2.118,5.1324,3.2908,3.2197,0.1263,4.8117,3.5982,0.6077,6.1031,1.053,0.3029,0.0002,3.1317,3.9666,0.0005,3.2239,3.2664,4.8624,3.1501,2.0552,2.4636,5.6066,2.283,4.4704,1.1489,1.264,4.1852,0.5013,5.9331,4.8511,3.671,0.7271,3.6226,2.8832,2.6552,0.2765,4.736,3.8832,7.8476,1.768,4.2633,2.0759,1.3652,2.298,2.5763,2.0585,2.0673,0.7098,0.0004,5.0457,6.3503,2.4821,4.0343,4.556,5.337,2.3497,4.8264,0.1798,1.8945,1.6463,5.3799,4.139,5.5663,1.097,1.0333,1.5865,2.987,0.1117,4.2653,1.6363,5.3881,1.1688,1.1509,0.0003,5.4664,5.8068,3.5841,3.9082,6.0936,0.3042,0.8532,0.0003,3.3329,0.6141,0.8754,0.6808,0.1185,0.1328]}

You are going to get in the way of those scientists, who need to do their jobs because of budgetary restraints. If you are going to give those people the security that you are asking for, then you are going to do it with those people.\"\n\nHe said that the administration is not aware of the existence of any other government agency on the federal government's payroll waiting for astronauts to return to Earth.\n\n\"We do not have any other program that you will use to ensure that you're not taking their money for themselves or on top of it,\" Musk said.\n\n\"We are working through an agreement with President Obama on how we do a full recovery.\"\n\nBut the Trump administration has said it won't use NASA's $7.9 billion budget to send humans back and is considering what will be left of that money in return.\n\nObama used to live on top of some of the other world's top oil fields. He called for a \"solar and atmospheric program.\"\n\n\"You know, there is one country, the American people, that is able to harness its power, its intelligence, to give the best possible chance of survival to the world's great civilizations. So there is no other country that can put their resources where their lives go, and provide the chance to return to life.\"\n\nThe current plan would let most people return at the end of their life after three decades of human captivity, Musk said. \"The number of people that would be available to survive in these circumstances is, by and large, extremely low right now.\"\n\nIt is unclear what part of that time there will be people, Musk said.\n\nBut the idea of people being forced out is very, very intriguing. And that may prove to be the one part of the Trump administration that will be interesting.\n\n\"I have been told it is going to be a very interesting year for Elon Musk for SpaceX and others,\" he said. \"There will be a lot of interesting stories about what has happened on Mars and what they have accomplished and what will happen in the future.\n\n\"The people who are working on that are going to be excited and very important.\"\n\n[More On This Topic: NASA's Apollo program doesn't have to return home to Earth now]\n\nMusk said that he has not decided if he supports setting up an asteroid deposit near the moon or whether people who are currently living in the areas must become part of a community they will support. It would be a far more expensive proposition without the funding \u2014 especially if they could eventually be paid back with more human investment, he said.\n\n\"The big question right now is: How much will this help us economically or for society at large?\" he said. \"There are so many different possibilities about these kinds of things being brought about, there are many different angles of what's possible and what's not possible.\"\n\nFor now, Musk hasn't decided how he wants to start a community. He wants his members to be able to work for some days to put some food on the table and \"make a difference.\"\n\n\"I am very excited about it,\" Musk said. \"As for the things that we have shown in the past, that is very, very exciting.\"","token_len":685,"entropy":[3.8828,2.7333,8.9116,2.8963,3.7616,2.2035,9.26,1.5913,3.4245,2.8364,0.0174,0.0287,0.0844,6.0571,1.4128,1.8395,1.3052,4.9116,0.0851,3.1383,5.009,2.6963,1.772,0.2143,5.6436,4.961,2.4985,3.168,3.9436,0.742,2.4879,0.873,1.127,4.6368,1.8556,4.9833,3.5039,1.0879,3.6737,0.6004,1.7883,1.8006,0.0208,4.329,4.4156,2.1378,1.7298,5.5353,1.8642,1.798,2.3948,2.7179,0.6147,0.2571,1.7678,0.8585,1.6447,1.0231,0.0027,3.5175,1.1417,2.3441,5.8171,1.4944,2.1741,0.244,0.0003,3.6841,1.5635,1.8059,2.097,4.0993,2.216,2.8874,5.362,0.1074,2.3359,4.8883,0.0155,2.0978,4.132,3.1473,1.3889,4.9303,1.087,5.0401,0.7554,0.6958,1.4222,6.9284,0.943,4.673,0.5177,2.7809,1.0269,0.3593,0.5565,0.3772,0.0002,0.9944,1.73,2.2691,0.3683,1.1288,0.7448,1.213,5.0685,1.353,4.5379,3.5119,5.2487,1.2608,4.6278,0.4601,2.3945,3.6742,1.4514,3.8269,5.6343,1.4618,2.6695,3.2223,2.4364,5.2265,5.2666,0.0434,1.8832,0.6291,5.8475,0.1976,0.2206,1.0226,0.0002,2.5573,1.7243,1.8237,3.5198,4.7486,3.8552,3.3152,0.7991,5.8208,0.5819,3.0862,2.2613,1.0174,3.8682,4.3139,4.1979,3.3846,4.122,0.2809,0.0002,4.071,2.5738,4.479,0.0824,1.1518,2.2454,0.8164,4.2524,0.0001,3.2705,1.4352,1.1639,2.9815,3.9503,0.679,2.9321,0.0714,1.2003,0.643,3.5481,3.1439,1.0963,5.8158,3.0782,3.0095,4.8722,4.8505,1.3179,4.9232,0.4378,2.4508,1.0237,2.68,4.2082,2.5176,0.3025,0.0002,5.3134,5.1608,3.0763,5.6302,1.8665,5.3175,0.0275,5.9236,0.5199,0.6153,5.1054,4.1892,0.0954,3.9508,4.3613,1.8721,1.7971,1.8458,4.5563,2.1705,1.8554,2.9426,4.8566,2.2204,5.1852,4.3233,4.2075,3.2525,0.5991,0.0003,1.7576,3.5346,2.2919,0.6355,3.1458,1.4383,3.7993,4.2475,2.6113,1.9274,5.8101,0.1205,0.2972,0.8316,1.5749,4.5587,0.0508,5.475,3.6974,3.3992,2.0845,3.2071,4.3393,0.6678,2.3937,5.1756,3.1326,3.1783,0.8634,2.9983,1.4926,1.799,1.3178,1.8545,2.8591,1.8516,4.6383,1.8356,2.3515,3.6074,3.4107,0.5653,1.3555,2.1497,0.7783,1.2739,1.0924,5.1842,3.0107,2.5963,2.1305,0.553,3.5914,4.9798,1.9436,1.099,5.7863,1.4551,5.7878,1.2312,4.195,0.6897,2.2257,3.2662,0.4227,0.0003,2.3965,5.77,3.1673,3.1622,5.0027,6.0881,3.4532,1.5181,5.6525,1.9976,0.3059,0.0034,0.4673,4.1501,4.2119,4.1393,2.5329,1.7105,4.3951,4.0659,1.5016,2.2883,0.1516,0.1379,4.5201,2.8288,5.4966,0.4916,0.4125,1.2526,2.2386,0.8497,4.3511,1.0351,5.397,2.5157,4.1352,1.8102,0.6194,4.6394,3.2038,1.6211,0.0014,0.0316,4.1357,1.7922,5.2844,0.0041,0.669,0.2087,0.0002,4.5037,1.6629,1.8148,1.8881,5.0271,0.0884,2.6905,5.63,4.1884,1.0527,0.0371,4.5815,3.0787,2.3094,0.1968,0.4637,0.7766,0.0002,3.5758,2.5328,3.2916,0.9785,3.1108,2.3376,4.6095,2.537,2.5719,4.6335,3.7781,0.0021,5.0662,1.0378,4.0349,3.2386,3.7657,4.5431,0.7134,0.0336,1.3404,5.2972,4.1886,0.3825,0.5653,2.3419,0.1214,0.5282,2.473,1.5492,5.2945,2.088,0.5898,0.0003,1.303,1.7092,3.4506,2.4867,2.7302,3.7777,0.9079,1.8227,0.0099,0.2202,1.4577,1.8339,1.2908,4.1159,1.0702,5.3977,0.1417,5.302,3.9717,1.99,5.1774,1.2731,2.9995,0.0388,0.0817,0.5268,3.4049,1.5805,0.1143,1.3898,0.4727,0.0692,2.8216,2.6921,1.9123,1.9093,4.4855,0.805,3.9531,1.9936,1.4039,1.6444,3.9421,1.5751,2.7662,2.9374,0.7214,4.0117,0.5638,1.7347,0.3309,0.3212,1.3105,1.989,0.0002,0.0766,3.089,4.3005,1.3175,1.1705,3.6349,0.9333,2.1623,1.8229,1.382,0.0025,0.7937,5.1717,2.6827,3.3025,4.1694,1.9929,0.9884,0.0003,5.658,4.7028,6.4637,2.3849,4.0193,0.5778,1.7448,1.6452,5.7299,1.9717,5.9643,0.0006,2.8795,1.6913,3.5571,4.4762,1.4543,0.6515,5.9314,0.647,0.0893,0.0001,2.6667,0.0005,0.7361,1.3493,2.2007,2.2018,2.6065,4.6348,2.4292,0.7116,5.5769,6.1128,0.5681,2.1326,3.6779,5.3968,4.1731,0.8375,0.5178,1.7703,1.4228,5.0365,3.0328,2.0467,3.9531,1.7638,1.321,1.4441,5.9334,6.3671,5.4043,3.0352,0.0029,1.8853,4.0286,6.2241,2.8813,4.9416,0.6432,5.1698,2.4433,0.6792,1.4671,4.849,1.5507,3.9406,2.5255,5.8657,1.5097,4.2122,5.5887,5.1203,1.2141,2.611,4.2574,5.3422,1.9429,4.1614,2.6041,3.4976,4.2418,5.6824,4.5219,2.7968,0.6162,0.197,0.246,0.1068,0.0003,0.7676,2.8041,5.3928,0.4435,3.4849,0.0064,0.1553,2.6453,2.2252,1.999,1.9771,2.8419,4.0082,1.5783,5.7122,2.3929,3.2436,4.2154,3.0792,0.0573,0.5727,0.9975,0.1162,0.0412,0.5565,3.3647,1.0532,2.4326,0.0262,2.1255,3.8345,5.4993,4.7129,2.5304,0.0005,0.7197,5.7962,3.5628,2.7777,2.1157,5.2444,1.0429,3.5999,0.8895,5.586,2.037,2.1708,3.4424,2.338,2.753,1.5821,1.061,0.5917,0.6318,1.1113,0.2928,0.0002,4.3175,1.4686,0.0554,1.1042,5.584,0.0003,2.5717,2.2388,1.4465,2.177,0.269,5.2031,2.7637,0.9638,1.6609,1.465,3.929,4.082,5.879,0.1594,1.7178,1.6302,0.0051,3.6862,2.994,5.0569,5.3767,3.0728,5.6272,3.5438,3.7972,0.2608,0.165,0.0985,1.5752,5.1644,3.0388,2.1666,1.768,1.6886,0.4044,0.0003,0.9944,1.3003,2.57,2.6246,2.2316,0.6393,2.4814,0.8081,1.9392,0.0338,0.1447,0.1737,5.3687,3.7675,1.3451,5.3481,0.4894,2.1458,2.558,5.8306,1.9125,0.6678,0.447,0.4314,2.707,1.9402,2.9874,2.9532,0.0024,1.2208,1.2469]}
{"id":4113,"ended":false,"length":636,"gen_text":"Two opposing war generals were granted the same wish by a single genie to win the upcoming battle.\n\nHowever, that desire for revenge eventually manifested itself on the battlefield.\n\nThe Great Army of China would soon have been defeated by Gen. Meng Qing, and the Emperor had to choose a new General.\n\nIf he didn't succeed in this situation, or if he wasn't aware of the existence of a 'Great' Army, what he wanted to do was to have him fight for his own reasons?\n\nIn the past, it was considered so important that Gen. Meng Qing would fight for his own reasons. As for now, since Gen. Meng Qing was such a great General, his desire to live by his own policy was a little more modest.\n\nThis time around, the Emperor decided to use martial law to save his people, and the situation became even more complicated.\n\nIn order to prevent another Great Army using force, the Emperor's orders were based on some of the other orders of the time. However, the Emperor's orders also came with a price. It would not be possible to stop this war if the soldiers stopped fighting.\n\nThe commander of the Third Dragon Army asked the Emperor to give orders to the general, which was so important because the people of the Three Kingdoms were so divided. At the same time, the Emperor sent a lot of military personnel to the Third Dragon Army to protect it. At that place, there was no reason to expect the others would stop fighting.\n\nThe Emperor's orders only served to increase the tension.\n\nOnce it reached the end, then only the general would see his people die. When their hearts had been pressed against each other at the beginning, the Emperor could have easily won.\n\nThe man didn't even know what to do. No matter how much he attempted to make time for fighting, the Great Army of China would eventually be annihilated.\n\nAs it was, when it was nearing the end, the general began using his strength to fight the troops that had taken it down.\n\nIf Gen. Meng Qing took up fighting stance, then the Great Army of North America would definitely also take on the Great Army of China.\n\n\"Hey, just try and think of anything you can think of for next time.\"\n\n\"Ea-chan, it's already past now. The enemy is over there now.\"\n\nThe man who had come right up to the emperor spoke to a high level voice. The man who was speaking to the emperor said a short time later that there would be a very high number of troops present at the end of the day.\n\n\"We should all die just to save our comrades from losing that massive monster that had taken over the Three Kingdoms\u2026\u2026 \"\n\nA man stood on a rock and said a long, piercing voice, \"Don't worry, I'll give it my best shot. The Great Army of North America\u2026\u2026\"\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence as the man who was saying that was looking at the man who was speaking in front of the emperor with an indifferent expression.\n\nThe Great Army of North America was no longer in the middle of the city, and the commander of the Second Division was standing here.\n\n[Previous Chapter] [Table of Contents] [Next

{"id":369,"ended":true,"length":676,"gen_text":"Everyone gets a bracelet that will light up more and more the closer they get to the person\/thing that will kill them. Yours has never glowed. One day, you meet a person whose bracelet has never stopped glowing. You pick it up that night and get to know him better. The day you meet his brother is when you make up for lost time, and when the lights turn green you start asking him about your love of music. The next night he tells you that he was right about his brother so you learn to love the music he made your life on the night he died. It is at that moment that you start to realize the meaning of music that has changed your life with so much emotion and love. You look forward to the rest of your life and then you are sad. If you get lost the next morning, you may have your bracelet back on. As a result, your life change starts to take place, and you stop loving the music that made its life easier for you.\nWhat is the meaning of what will go on forever?\nFor someone who dies and has to live a second time, some of the other meanings of love will change too, or not at all, or be lost to us. You might have a hard time focusing on what will really be going on your life. If you do not know where the meaning might come from, feel free to skip to the last section.\nAs a former lover I love the thought of my death changing my life without me noticing and seeing the meaning it is my life's purpose. My life changed in response to a time that I truly loved, and thought out that meaning. What will it like for me after my next date? And when? If you are not happy with what went on in the past, what will you do?\nAs a former lover of music I know my song is changing my life in very real ways. My career as a musician has greatly changed my life. I am always on my own to make time for my personal music (I work full time. My work time helps me stay motivated, focused, and fulfilled ). My music's song will always leave me feeling like I am going to change my life, not just the ones around me.\nIf the meaning of love is unknown to you, make sure you know that what is going on you will not be lost. The more you focus on what is important to you and your life now for sure, the less you will have to be discouraged after getting married.\nAs a music lover, the first thing you do is go to the store and buy my CDs. I would gladly sell my CDs because I am aware that they were made by my friends and family who were on that song tour and so they were excited to hear our band playing. The only time that they missed out on all of our good music is when they play that song again where they were on the final song for \" The Night I Kissed You \". If you do not ask how the song was made, no one will know how to make a CD for you, in the end, you need to have a good CD making skills in order to make this. Once your time with music runs out, you will have to search for new music online or find my CD reviews, to find what is new in your new music and put them to good use.","token_len":685,"entropy":[7.3542,2.1817,9.9548,2.4018,3.2396,6.7732,0.4444,7.4165,3.6943,0.2414,4.5723,4.3545,1.4321,0.6851,0.265,1.3033,4.2375,7.1594,1.6921,1.7854,3.2262,6.1838,0.4043,0.5011,6.2577,7.4375,4.544,3.8948,11.5206,0.8193,3.4268,6.5289,2.5061,1.4819,1.7203,5.8968,1.1047,3.4462,3.942,2.6004,3.2066,4.7908,5.8003,2.3571,0.6482,1.8875,5.3216,0.9372,0.0277,6.3383,1.9566,0.5861,4.5837,1.7814,1.2704,2.1596,1.6577,0.487,2.9369,3.2975,2.4349,1.0313,3.6092,3.0644,2.3947,2.2947,0.8095,5.76,4.0969,2.3614,0.7984,0.0703,3.0197,1.6331,2.7755,3.0163,4.2208,2.823,2.7562,2.0033,3.6202,5.9821,2.2171,2.2783,2.4889,4.6498,3.3321,2.857,0.532,2.7974,1.6132,2.7544,1.6931,2.7318,0.037,1.29,0.7799,3.2451,4.9825,1.7759,2.1574,1.6063,6.0358,0.8564,5.0576,1.889,1.3585,3.2025,1.2698,2.5622,2.8725,5.8965,1.8649,2.9141,1.7162,3.8869,1.7785,1.4024,0.2916,3.2831,2.1257,5.0126,1.2762,0.8222,0.6354,0.4532,3.2194,0.6926,1.8413,2.956,3.3533,0.2068,2.3522,3.6184,2.8631,3.2925,0.8717,0.1176,5.6945,4.1322,0.4443,4.8379,1.2188,1.7624,0.3251,2.2606,5.5668,3.6658,0.0365,1.874,4.3908,0.0411,0.3444,0.1597,2.1252,4.1685,1.2975,3.1867,4.9089,1.6879,4.7346,0.4738,4.5391,2.9978,5.1064,0.8658,2.1994,0.8847,0.6748,3.9093,2.4916,4.562,2.603,2.8307,2.5792,1.4773,5.0357,2.689,1.3505,0.5683,2.4225,1.2792,5.1218,4.3497,0.7742,1.5287,0.6004,3.2494,0.7087,0.8784,5.0104,3.6168,1.3674,0.1709,1.7906,3.0989,6.9294,1.1763,3.7715,1.1546,0.0803,0.372,2.217,6.5829,1.9584,1.7116,2.2964,0.1029,5.5061,5.3759,5.081,0.5451,2.4816,0.4526,1.3689,4.2646,4.4964,0.5666,5.5468,3.2609,2.731,3.0161,1.4411,2.7627,4.4427,2.5706,0.4177,6.0417,1.6368,0.4453,5.7435,2.8111,0.9913,3.8998,2.4267,2.9359,3.3497,2.7173,3.8895,4.2008,1.3507,0.0081,1.6658,3.0417,3.6142,1.9404,3.5956,2.2151,0.5351,3.3727,2.6557,2.2819,1.7746,5.405,0.0249,5.0494,0.2114,1.4165,1.381,4.5011,2.9621,2.1558,0.0519,5.1165,0.625,1.2802,3.2737,0.4216,3.8285,2.0994,2.5203,3.5594,2.417,1.2989,5.3457,1.6609,0.0089,0.2941,6.1587,0.3073,0.0071,4.9991,1.4543,0.4972,3.593,1.5238,1.0551,1.0263,4.94,1.6668,4.9937,2.1402,3.2846,4.0456,2.3178,4.2979,0.1388,3.5609,5.6125,4.6608,0.7493,0.5381,5.9729,2.5741,2.9231,3.7658,3.8845,2.3371,2.34,3.9205,3.2727,5.8367,0.7439,4.9457,2.2483,2.0398,3.8151,1.622,2.0253,3.1964,4.0466,0.032,2.9679,4.6015,1.9019,1.1393,5.0245,1.285,2.4883,1.0015,5.9523,5.5165,4.908,4.0214,1.1128,4.3181,2.6716,2.3527,6.7766,2.8649,0.5309,4.495,1.791,5.0935,4.8039,0.4683,5.1074,3.3232,3.0873,4.3045,1.9245,1.5862,3.1931,3.5235,0.7447,1.9412,5.764,0.123,1.3291,2.5162,0.6048,0.5267,2.0756,0.8248,1.2483,0.6683,1.4881,1.5566,3.629,0.9301,1.365,0.2963,2.6734,0.7976,1.1743,3.9396,3.9839,5.0646,2.8908,5.1419,1.1732,0.1258,3.0524,5.5146,3.0742,0.1739,0.3642,3.1978,5.3316,3.4351,0.2447,1.1266,0.9121,5.7371,1.0967,2.2441,0.2683,1.041,0.8736,2.0193,5.2738,3.5195,2.7606,3.193,3.5835,2.183,5.3319,0.4934,1.6701,5.2278,1.7846,5.9396,2.7023,5.3233,3.8891,0.2313,5.4217,2.6428,4.7492,4.7452,6.3288,0.5084,4.0901,1.9317,1.8713,4.7841,0.6059,0.3666,4.6064,7.4875,2.1205,2.0404,5.5734,5.201,3.3804,2.5694,6.0229,0.6038,1.7441,2.2865,0.4737,0.8653,4.308,0.6027,3.6718,0.9638,0.1346,1.9911,4.0256,1.3395,2.6227,4.0443,2.99,0.0465,0.4225,1.6755,3.3343,4.1592,1.7213,0.4575,2.1372,1.217,5.8057,0.9171,0.0811,0.3803,5.7601,0.6647,0.9184,2.1611,2.7,3.2302,2.331,1.5666,0.1195,5.2192,1.4067,2.2542,1.1571,2.5411,1.4638,3.2979,3.4263,0.6719,5.1579,0.0845,1.1006,1.5651,3.109,0.8371,0.077,1.9234,1.8963,1.2816,6.4085,5.5558,4.7006,0.2294,0.0273,2.5239,1.3779,0.8445,2.236,0.1031,3.4999,5.1339,6.7781,4.7945,2.9514,0.7867,1.3503,3.3428,0.3259,4.6689,0.1877,1.2531,3.7116,4.8039,0.902,0.4587,2.6545,0.8846,4.5189,1.2322,1.4752,2.3804,0.8517,0.6446,4.5923,3.1593,0.6285,1.8526,4.1747,6.1081,2.5592,1.385,0.3895,5.1259,0.9915,2.2973,5.6347,0.745,2.5118,3.91,3.0976,1.3316,2.4205,3.1391,0.9738,1.4048,2.6875,2.7612,4.4089,4.6259,4.7517,3.1116,2.4792,5.1838,2.2305,2.2097,4.8668,0.9102,1.1352,5.8486,4.2153,2.1411,1.1424,2.9207,3.4568,3.5198,2.682,2.9697,4.9177,0.9114,0.3308,5.6019,1.02,1.5402,4.6763,0.9519,2.2565,0.2974,1.5673,4.2188,4.0784,0.8454,3.4534,6.3945,1.5038,3.062,3.5252,1.0805,4.7465,2.5891,4.0546,4.5671,5.2752,4.1509,2.4415,3.1233,0.0357,1.6012,0.763,2.7765,0.7333,2.795,0.1964,6.6805,4.4079,2.8002,1.4014,2.1196,0.6475,0.5258,5.7348,0.6341,0.3634,0.9559,3.4982,2.7375,1.5544,1.8277,1.4859,3.0868,0.1836,2.4259,6.3288,2.4127,2.0008,1.8807,1.2306,4.7659,0.2468,3.773,1.3277,2.9086,4.2626,5.8204,4.2511,3.7386,0.3183,0.0484,1.4476,3.9311,4.8258,4.858,3.4464,5.1397,1.5009,2.3783,6.6132,0.1982,0.4561,1.3359,0.8741,1.6758,0.6362,5.3102,0.5158,1.892,1.4962,4.6392,2.4234,2.9407,5.2163,3.03,5.0385,3.2466,4.1383,1.9947,3.082,2.3842,3.0525,2.3769,1.3272,4.832,1.2449,2.0831,5.4032,3.3307,2.3214,1.1379,0.0053,0.2383]}
{"id":847,"ended":false,"length":564,"gen_text":"Twin brothers with a strong telepathic connection discover the elixir of life. Only one is granted immortality, but their telepathic connection transcends the mortal brother's death, providing the first Physical World\/Afterlife connection.\n\nNecromancer in the World of Darkness\n\nAfter the destruction of the demon-infested planet known as the Necromancer, the surviving Death Knight, Lestari, is recruited as part of the Necromancer training program. During the training, his powers of telepathy and foresight are enhanced to superhuman levels using the aid of the Black Magic Stone. Due to the massive and unique necromancer training regimen, Lestari eventually defeats the Dark Lord with ease, and with Lestari's knowledge and abilities he can defeat him for any reason.\n\nDark Reign\n\nWhen the necromancer's powers have been restored by the Dark God himself, Lestari leaves his home to pursue his career as an assassin.\n\nLestari: The Dragon's Heart, The Black Magic Stone\n\nIn the game Dark Reign, Lestari and the Black Mage who have trained with him during the training period are trained in the Necromancer's ritual in the same ritual which is known as the Dragon's Heart. They were not aware of the secret Necromancer training when they were introduced to his power, but the training is one of the most powerful of all the rituals performed on the Necromancer by the Black Mage.\n\nAfter Lestari's fall, Rachael and the Necromancer return to life where the ritual is called \"Innistracism of the Black Dragon\". The Necromancer training is one of the main reasons for Rachael and Velen choosing to escape Naxxramas, taking advantage of the death of the Dark Lord on the planet, as they believed that the Dark Lord would be able to destroy humans and their race to become the true Emperor of the Empire.\n\nThe Priestesses of All\n\nIf the Death Knight was part of the necromancer training program, he or she is chosen as the Priestess of All with the option of going into exile, taking any chance or choosing to remain in the Demon's Dream, or not.\n\nIf the Priestess of All chose to leave Naxxramas or did not perform the Necromancer ritual, Rhaegal is sent back in time to defeat Lestari.\n\nVampire Slayer in the Demon's Dream\n\nRachael's first appearance in the Demon's Dream is in the quest to take control of Vampiric Vampire with Lestari as her new assistant. Rachael was previously the Black Mage of the Necromancer. She was one of the first three Necromancers to reach the Dark Lord without the aid of the Sword of the Dead.\n\nIn all of these adventures, Rachael also serves as Lestari's companion and as Lestari's trusted advisor. A few of the more notable appearances of Rachael in the game involve her using a small force to pull in new players from the main campaign by helping them defeat the Death Knights.\n\nNotes\n\nLestari was originally called \"Eldritch Elf (sic) in the original Dark Age of Camelot;

{"id":340,"ended":false,"length":656,"gen_text":"Magic exist. But apparently to cast a spell, you have to beatbox your opponent's spells in hand instead. The game ends on the turn of your turn (the game ends with the most combo points). I know those are the three-faced cards I'm supposed to love, and they're always there, but when do you want them? In this time I'm actually pretty sure.\n\nIt is a game about Magic\u2014it is Magic unlike anything else out there. In the end your opponent won't have a problem hitting you with their basic set of four lands. Their opponent won't have any problem hitting you with their first land, with your. A few things: If you have your card advantage on. As a card draw spell, you can usually do it anyway. You won't use it because they have a land that's your converted mana cost and you don't have a land, so there's no need to get your own. Just have a card draw spell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey might say, \"If he had a land on turns three and four\u2014before he had a land last turn\u2014it'd be perfectly legal.\" And they're right. On their part they might even say, \"I'd rather get something else on the board. He may think I'm using my \"magic\" card rather than the \"unland on the stack\" spell I'm using the same turn.\"\n\nAnd because, even if you get your own, your opponent hasn't even done it yet. So it can be done! It's like an art form that you get to do by getting a card that is clearly meant for, so in effect they said I should do that at my opponent's upkeep. And in the end they didn't. I didn't even get the turn where they gave me a land. I just went under the impression this was a set feature I was going to get anyway. There's one big difference with this. I was getting a good start, but my opponent was still playing. If I had, it was obvious I had to go.\n\nI mean, you can turn the board if you have some kind of. Then even sometimes you're not going to get that one turn turn. But is he going to be able to turn the board and attack his opponents with his? Maybe. Maybe not. One thing I really want to say about this is that I'm a little surprised that anyone, even Magic's most dominant players\u2014not just this guy from Minneapolis who's obviously playing by his game\u2014doesn't know that there are two things going on with the game. One is that the game isn't really over. And I like that.\n\nSo, I think that there's much to be said here about Magic's \"next move,\" but for now I just want to let you know the game was going to be about a good thing in a way no new players are going to be able to experience for very long once they get that card. It's about as good as a new person can learn to play with.\n\nThat was a great story. I really wanted to thank Brian Johnson, of The New York Times for the lovely introduction\u2014and I'm glad to be able to talk about it here.\n\n[To Brian's friend, Matt] \"Sydney's a great player.\"\n\n\u2014","token_len":687,"entropy":[10.1606,1.9328,3.7782,6.8897,6.3947,7.4595,1.9075,0.3489,1.8466,0.9409,1.792,0.0261,6.7003,12.8265,3.5738,0.9619,1.623,3.6558,3.193,5.7061,4.8599,1.1822,3.1589,3.7083,3.1946,3.5023,1.5771,3.3174,2.308,1.4043,1.7567,3.6531,3.1878,2.7229,1.3422,2.966,1.383,5.35,5.6078,1.3666,1.65,4.1875,3.7998,6.0378,1.4819,3.0049,5.5743,3.3448,5.7166,0.8928,2.6092,1.7059,5.5695,0.0011,5.6615,1.2601,2.6462,2.1857,0.8632,4.488,2.3504,1.4145,0.3486,3.7625,4.6609,1.1048,2.2983,0.9792,0.5071,4.2698,2.0649,6.1757,3.3524,1.5221,4.8643,3.7367,1.4855,5.219,0.9524,0.014,4.3029,3.5265,2.4833,2.962,3.0681,5.5119,5.3872,2.9911,1.6621,3.4164,5.9692,1.2161,0.9397,1.7357,0.0054,0.5006,3.8062,2.1406,2.9733,5.7153,1.2623,3.3959,0.2539,2.284,1.9122,3.9749,5.8742,1.3067,1.1055,2.3379,5.3986,5.5528,0.6575,4.5063,3.7198,1.3111,4.3482,3.0651,1.859,0.0009,0.4734,2.1228,1.2734,1.3175,0.4611,0.0437,0.4864,4.7658,1.4334,1.3648,5.0479,2.9267,9.4034,5.1746,3.3764,3.7716,3.9963,5.2809,0.7774,2.4401,3.6807,6.0218,0.666,3.3952,7.273,5.5005,2.6488,4.6969,2.216,2.9887,0.5998,1.2916,1.3832,5.3608,3.5083,2.2978,4.9256,0.676,2.5391,3.9021,0.0009,5.6181,1.7086,4.4602,3.9429,1.9646,1.8947,2.9846,3.266,1.8955,5.0456,6.6371,0.0035,0.0434,3.1133,1.247,1.4254,0.0003,0.5058,1.5486,1.1057,4.183,1.462,4.1979,0.6397,0.4106,2.3406,0.3918,4.0577,2.1571,3.9738,1.2691,5.2918,4.6999,1.7287,3.5995,1.0014,0.2365,1.5631,1.5358,0.0002,5.0261,0.1261,0.0002,5.3183,4.1066,3.5379,1.5869,0.2008,4.0935,4.1651,2.6433,1.3474,1.0381,2.6014,7.5685,2.7275,0.3931,0.3231,5.0597,5.8187,1.8504,2.2953,1.4975,0.7011,5.9164,0.2936,0.7882,2.9354,2.9939,0.4055,5.686,1.6006,1.7732,3.2811,2.1457,2.144,0.5026,0.3645,5.5044,3.5161,3.2379,2.523,2.8493,4.9023,0.5906,0.3654,0.0129,3.2327,3.4262,1.8107,3.9146,4.6531,2.6234,2.7676,1.7562,1.235,3.0421,2.8588,4.6823,4.0429,2.1063,0.7718,4.3292,2.1195,6.0641,3.6597,1.5067,2.6861,4.9014,0.0216,3.0412,1.7299,5.6062,4.0263,4.2926,2.2372,1.8674,0.7029,2.7045,3.199,1.0024,0.9117,5.6883,3.5737,0.8754,0.6746,1.3773,0.0002,3.3509,5.3502,5.1354,4.446,1.2298,1.2055,3.5488,1.7411,1.4598,1.8378,3.049,0.3012,5.353,0.0003,3.2711,4.3932,1.8899,0.7414,3.5739,2.8252,3.2392,4.4638,1.2495,3.4068,4.8148,2.8503,1.0179,3.0003,4.1853,3.9412,1.217,2.8391,2.2066,4.2798,0.8597,1.8824,4.293,4.3938,2.1805,3.4252,2.6085,3.3266,5.6028,4.3664,1.2469,6.2316,5.2114,5.3023,4.2929,2.5601,5.4712,5.2957,3.2438,2.8577,2.5498,6.0924,3.2731,2.0383,0.0931,4.6031,0.6017,2.5773,3.501,1.9697,0.2762,1.9398,2.958,0.0006,1.906,2.799,3.5701,0.0005,2.0699,1.6765,2.4014,4.701,4.5427,1.4932,4.4513,0.3117,1.1415,1.2436,0.999,2.073,2.9202,4.0664,6.7119,1.2801,4.4295,5.3308,0.709,1.4799,5.4033,6.2154,4.1472,2.0437,1.4028,0.0499,2.5144,5.8631,0.5132,5.3868,0.9596,4.6543,4.3795,1.4182,3.7342,1.5055,2.4038,2.843,3.0642,3.9575,1.433,5.6815,5.2459,2.2095,1.3192,1.8798,0.4364,1.8476,3.5568,2.4252,3.5662,3.9991,0.8599,1.8198,5.2943,3.8386,2.7839,5.3643,1.8726,2.3696,1.5903,2.7358,3.8364,1.3125,0.0002,2.4958,4.2154,0.1839,2.9802,1.8819,5.6768,2.7207,3.5241,4.1528,0.2768,2.5656,3.6227,3.361,0.0024,8.1474,5.3946,6.5677,7.3295,1.1686,2.9371,2.0748,1.0642,0.0251,1.384,2.6217,4.0347,2.112,3.6169,1.2642,2.5291,6.5414,5.7685,0.9885,0.0203,2.0626,1.0244,0.006,3.3844,0.8539,0.6056,2.9428,4.6037,5.4206,2.8741,2.3092,1.7688,5.6359,3.8543,1.2892,2.0129,0.3734,0.2407,5.9727,1.8714,0.9337,3.9629,2.7883,0.2838,2.4704,1.8983,0.6349,0.671,0.6799,2.2065,2.1333,2.6308,3.1714,2.5701,1.2531,4.6136,4.8755,1.5174,2.7162,1.5678,1.7268,4.8917,2.8954,3.6259,3.4133,1.2255,4.6094,1.1691,3.4128,5.8339,3.2571,2.6676,5.6769,3.3808,6.0391,1.7183,2.8606,2.9062,2.6233,0.0001,3.2385,2.0261,3.4058,1.2581,2.6286,3.0144,2.0777,0.0172,2.7915,1.6863,1.3915,0.6338,1.8271,0.7359,0.5753,2.3191,1.6774,3.2048,0.0004,2.2863,4.3848,1.5973,2.3525,3.2028,5.5258,1.1505,0.933,1.1666,0.0002,4.5632,2.3004,2.3268,2.1692,2.1674,3.4646,0.6853,5.8895,1.5147,1.0142,0.4218,2.8355,0.9901,2.317,1.8594,4.387,5.8092,3.6269,2.2936,1.9469,3.6132,0.7584,1.076,2.6423,0.3019,0.0922,3.5596,0.3129,0.5657,4.634,3.315,3.7413,2.9512,0.5606,0.6798,3.6095,3.0791,4.5164,2.893,3.9352,2.1905,1.2831,5.5301,7.0503,2.1382,2.5303,0.7932,0.0119,0.9427,0.2225,0.0044,3.1858,3.0042,5.188,0.1051,7.1154,1.0679,1.3779,4.06,3.2434,0.5297,2.9883,0.7841,2.2576,5.483,1.9245,0.3127,2.8583,2.8183,3.5977,1.1356,5.4432,1.4879,0.4518,2.9738,0.848,0.9883,0.0002,4.9429,3.9436,1.7783,2.3844,4.8188,0.9639,1.9554,3.3988,3.0094,0.1119,2.8269,5.4287,5.5483,1.5437,4.2846,3.5775,3.7955,0.4787,0.1475,1.2528,2.4337,5.7534,4.8153,4.3312,1.4813,1.9278,2.0281,2.6196,2.0678,2.0519,1.5722,0.005,3.4527,0.5541,0.7872,2.8231,0.8012,1.3315,0.0002,3.4063,5.5961,1.8808,3.6344,3.9096,1.7095,4.8319,3.9882,4.8719,5.1264,5.4016,0.3618,3.5919,2.6908,2.5756,3.6042,2.3488,1.0209,0.0002,4.7172]}
{"id":3356,"ended":true,"length":648,"gen_text":"Cannibalism is a widely accepted social norm... but one that has been subjected to massive and prolonged scrutiny and derisive denunciation because of serious and pervasive misgivings about how we behave in order to promote the public good.\n\nThis is not new. We have seen the same kind of derision directed at certain kinds of people of any race. And in the words of a few philosophers at Yale, \"The human species is divided into the four classes of beings that have evolved to satisfy the requirements of all these capacities. To the extent that we are able to get our head around this, the human species will eventually give way\u2014it's not going to be by our own actions but the result of our actions\u2014or it will come into conflict with this new evolutionary order.\" In recent years, scholars have been taking a more nuanced look at humanity's mental, physical and moral problems. We have now taken a decidedly different perspective about some of the key social issues facing humanity. In response, we have created a new and unique organization on the part of some of the world's leading researchers. These organizations strive to create a better world, to nurture creativity, to foster social cohesion, to provide health care, to empower public safety, to fight poverty and social injustice.\n\nOur movement is changing. We are doing this because we need to. We need to do the same at home and in schools. We need to do as many things together as possible that will enable us to get our head around these critical problems. And we need to do that in an effort to understand and prevent future problems.\n\nWe also need to understand what we expect from each other, at the grassroots level, when we talk about a problem or issue. And what we think is the most important fact about our time in this fight: When one group wants something, everyone will want it. In other words, every organization and every profession can develop its own set of methods to encourage collective action for collective good. We are fighting for change at the grassroots level. We are fighting for change at the global level. And we are fighting for progress at the national and local levels.\n\nThe people who are working on this problem are the very people who have the right to tell students that they are not living up to their ideals, that we are not fighting for democracy and free markets, that we want to abolish corporatism. We are fighting for liberty. We are fighting for equality.\n\nWe are fighting for peace. And we are fighting for prosperity.\n\nThere is good reason behind this. One reason is that our goals \u2014 to liberate human beings from a political tyranny, for human rights, for social justice \u2014 also have the full support of God, and of God's plan to move us closer to these goals. And this is how we ought to live our day, and today and for ever hereafter.\n\nIt's in the midst of all this that we hope to use our skills in civil disobedience and resistance as well as to stand up and fight for the values that we as a movement stand up for.\n\nWe hope to encourage our readers of The New American to get involved in our campaigns and other organizations by signing up for our newsletters: here.

{"id":905,"ended":false,"length":647,"gen_text":"You ; leading a mundane existence are suddenly taken on a surreal adventure by strange people in an RV... and one that makes the whole situation seem surreal, absurd, and ridiculous.\" (The American Historical Review, Vol. 42, No. 2, p. 1428.)\n\nIt is hard to see into the absurdity of those two elements in this situation. Is it conceivable that these people actually have any desire to go away? The idea that they have any desire to go away and that they were actually here for the purpose of something else is simply ridiculous. In other words, who were these people and their reasons? Was there any purpose at all? What is our goal? Is the goal of a sane society or a society of irrational people who expect to live a normal existence in the foreseeable future?\n\nThe second part of the article discusses a number of theories regarding some of the strange occurrences that occur during the paranormal, and there are many reasons why we would likely say that these are things some of the paranormal world has to offer. One of the most interesting theories is that this is a way for the supernatural to get out of its psychological shackles. This is a theory that is very popular among some of the most vocal paranormal investigators. It's easy to assume that most (if not all) of the people who claim paranormal events to be real, will fall in love with and become associated with people associated with this supernatural world that they are investigating.\n\nAn idea that has always haunted American researchers is that that people will inevitably be in contact with people associated with paranormal situations that they are investigating. In other words, the people who have been the subject of paranormal encounters may be linked to people who are associated with paranormal occurrences at some point in the future. One very popular theory is that some people have somehow \"lost the ability to recognize the paranormal.\" This is a similar idea that has been proposed previously by the paranormal field. In other words, people seem to be so disconnected with the paranormal that they may not even recognize any other kind of paranormal activity in the paranormal world at all.\n\nIt is one thing to have something the paranormal researcher can't explain away and see that isn't what they see at the beginning of a night. But if one can put a lot of thought into one's research question so that one isn't over-analyzing, the research becomes even more disoriented as one gets further into the investigation. Even less analytic research can only yield so much, so as to help some of these people learn about what actually happened.\n\nIf you are interested in going deeper into this paranormal phenomenon, and if there is any other paranormal related material you need please feel free to leave a comment below. Otherwise, we look forward to your questions and feedback.

{"id":4316,"ended":false,"length":647,"gen_text":"You literally wake up with the person of your dreams next to you... and your real partner on your other side... and your real friend is coming to hug you... and the other person is falling for you... and you are like, 'Oh yeah, great!' It's really amazing.\n\nThis could also hold true with those two friends who are often more of a co-worker and have shared lives.\n\nIt also holds true with people who are often partners. Again, it could also hold true for your relationship dynamics as well.\n\nEven so, it's difficult to understand the potential for this to happen on a personal level because we've seen our personal differences, the fact that we don't have a boyfriend or girlfriend, and a large number of things that you do that you probably shouldn't do with anyone else because they can influence people's decisions.\n\nWhat are some strategies?\n\nWe are all aware that there are so many different ways to live together, so some of the key strategies are:\n\nGetting to know each other.\n\nBeing on the outside.\n\nSetting boundaries.\n\nBeing honest.\n\nBeing open-minded.\n\nBeing good friends with other people.\n\nBeing supportive, like, every single day.\n\nGetting to know each other is one thing. But, we all fall in love once and for all.\n\nEven though there are so many different ways to start living together, that's always what we're after -- a way of working towards common goals and ideals. That means engaging in activities like learning to code, using a computer, writing a journal, taking a class, working on a project, and doing a lot of time at my own pace. It also means being a better partner in case that something that may not work, may not go your way. At this point, you may have found the right set of options. If it doesn't work out for you, or you even have a bad relationship, you will certainly leave.\n\nAlso, it's a big, big deal that some people try to stay on the outside even when it's hard. In any case, I am definitely a believer in staying positive, not fighting back. The more we focus on what is important to us and who we are for life and the world, then, the more we will learn to love us and to want to live more together. We may not be 100 percent sure who, but we are sure it gives new meaning to this life together. Stay positive and open-minded, if only they found that love.\n\nWhat about relationships with other people? How does that differ from the way it does when we all live together?\n\nRelationships aren't created overnight. There are lots and lots of ways to be someone else. A successful relationship can't always be perfect, and certainly, it's no guarantee you will always find a way to be there for the rest of your life. But there are multiple ways to be in a relationship. One is with your partner. Another is by dating someone who isn't as great as yourself. You can always try some things to find the perfect partner in your life, and if you don't find a workable solution to life's problems, then what are your options?\n\nLet's take a look at some of the

{"id":2139,"ended":false,"length":655,"gen_text":"Describe an individual or a group of people killed by their vices, but not in the way you would expect.\n\nConsider the following example:\n\nA group of people that we know to be virulent of homosexuality have been murdered by the police and killed by cops for being involved in their homosexual activities:\n\nThese police killing have violated our principles of personal responsibility and right of privacy. Now we live in a society where public opinion will demand a strong and independent prosecutor to put an end to this horrific act. So the law must do its job. The problem is with the police, not us.\n\nDo you have a better case?\n\nNo, but the law would be perfect. The state must not punish or punish members of our family who oppose the homosexual lifestyle. We must do away with the stigma generated by this hate crime and simply act. There would be no crime, no injustice, nothing about this. As far as there is in our Constitution, the Second Amendment does not extend to violence against the person or against those who disagree with us. If any of you have any doubts or feel that this situation is a problem, share this thread.\n\nWe do not have to live in a world where hatred of gays is one of everyday life issues. The hatred will not extend to violent people like you or your neighbors. So what is the alternative?\n\nThere are no laws designed to punish those who oppose homosexual behavior. These laws impose upon law-abiding people that are willing to share their moral views that are against homosexuality, regardless of their orientation. By enforcing these laws, our society seeks to impose further discrimination and oppression against those who disagree with it.\n\nMany law-abiding persons who are against homosexuality are simply trying to protect themselves from those who disagree with them on that issue. If we are not able to protect them from those who may be different from us, those who believe the gay lifestyle should be allowed to be celebrated in this country and others, we may no longer be free, and, if any other person could be victimized, we would suffer terribly, because not all homosexuals are equally morally wrong.\n\nIt would be great if the law was that way. However, we do not wish this law to be passed. The gay community needs a strong and independent one who will stand beside and for gay people living in our society, and that's me. We'll be there to help our neighbor to overcome this tragedy. If she isn't with us, she is not with some of you, not this nation, not that of our neighbors. What does her community think about this murder? Is she so concerned with how to act that she does not believe this could happen to a person who is a law-abiding gay person who also supports the gay lifestyle?\n\nSo don't get this straight away: love for everyone, oppose homophobia, speak out, take a stand, but no law will ever remove you from one's life.\n\nFor you, we need to do our part.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nP.S We are grateful to all of you for the support we've received over the years.

{"id":1669,"ended":true,"length":655,"gen_text":"Satan does an AMA.\n\n. The video in the video is not the first one. The others include his own AMA. In November 2015, Google Play Music added content to the original playlist that was supposed to include new tracks, videos and other features.\n\n\"You probably understand right now that all this [new content] is just not yet finished, and that what he's doing is just not that important to me, and that it'll just be taken care of by other people so that it's more available to the general public,\" Klayman said. It's hard to overstate just how much the Google Play Music music service is being utilized by many. As a result, YouTube can be a great platform for streaming music from some of the biggest labels in its region. But while the service is getting a lot of traffic from fans outside of Japan, there's a problem with the content, too: The video has been taken down from YouTube.\n\nYouTube, the biggest YouTube market in the world, doesn't seem to like some of the content of YouTube videos.\n\n\"To some extent you can argue that we've put ourselves in a position where we feel that this is the most important way to go and to help people, is the only way to be free. So the question is how do you provide access to the content? We're at a point in time where we're at the point that we understand that you need to look at the content like a business-like and take responsibility for that content,\" he said.\n\nWe have a solution?\n\nThat's what YouTube is looking for in this case.\n\nYosuke Kono, a Google Senior Fellow in Internet Communication at IHS Markit, is the publisher of YouTube's YouTube Videos. At IHS Markit, Kono specializes in delivering videos to users. The company's video platform for content, meanwhile, has been developed as part of Google's YouTube for Music partnership.\n\nIn the short term, Kono said YouTube will try to build on the success made with Google Music, especially its YouTube Music store. But as more content on YouTube videos comes out, Kono said, it will grow. He noted one notable YouTube video that wasn't featured on the YouTube Music store, the now-defunct YouTube One Live stream. The video shows the first of several YouTube Live live streams going live starting on Monday, Feb. 9, 2015, for YouTube in the United States.\n\nBut Kono said it's unlikely that YouTube would really be able to do all the full YouTube video creation. The only time a video appears online on all of YouTube Live right now would be if it's featured on a show on your feed. Then \"we look at it for a year, and it becomes a YouTube Channel,\" he said.\n\nKono also said YouTube wants new content from the major labels, but he doesn't want to use copyrighted material in their videos. He also didn't see how Google would be able to keep its content free from the various online publishers.\n\n\"I think YouTube would also be wise to figure out which brand to bring up and which to remove, because they might end up with more valuable brand content, because that's when video will be the source.\"\n\nYouTube didn't respond to my request for an interview.\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 The Washington Times, LLC.

A neighbor who knew the man told KOMO the man had a phone he found on the porch in the same property and that he was waiting for the man to call him to talk about what had happened to him when he got home.\n\nHe told the man to give the man some money: The man returned the rest of the money to the owner, who took $5 from his cellphone.\n\n\"He said he had a nice bag of pizza.\" the neighbor told KOMO. \"When he looked at it he had a bag of pizza on his hand, it was a bag of food and he gave it to the guy.\"\n\nKOMO went back to the man's house, but only after looking at his cellphone and found him wearing his diaper, a white T-shirt, a t-shirt and shorts. He pointed to the man's cellphone and said that he needed to talk to him about what was happening to him.\n\nBut during the conversation, the man told KOMO the man was going to call 911 if any information was not offered:\n\n\"I want help because I can't take him to jail if something goes wrong with the person I gave him a slice of pizza.\"\n\nThe man told KOMO he had tried texting him several times, but never had one.\n\nThe man had stopped by the home just a few blocks from where the man had crashed his vehicle. The man told authorities that he had noticed the man's cellphone with his body.\n\nAfter some investigation, police arrived and found the man's home on the left.\n\nInvestigators then found that there were two children inside of the home, but the father was not able to show them to a neighbor, according to the report.\n\nHe also tried to turn on his children, who he also believed \"played with the pizza package.\" The child was identified as 15-year-old Kia, and no weapons were found in the home, the report said.\n\nInvestigators were also given a description of the home in case anyone needed to ask about it, and interviewed five people who could be seen in the video.\n\nIn an interview with NBC-TV, the man was told he had \"lost\" his wallet and his mobile phone, but he offered it to police because \"nothing is going right\" with his arrest, the report said. The man's next step would be to see the police on their way to find the pizza.","token_len":699,"entropy":[5.2847,2.8428,8.4999,2.7459,2.0221,3.1894,10.6423,6.4688,0.9644,0.0241,0.1036,1.5861,5.3923,0.9452,9.2406,4.5949,2.0855,0.3016,5.9151,3.1944,5.0121,5.8844,6.1502,2.8518,3.3674,1.678,3.4484,1.3398,2.1906,5.4932,4.4505,3.3498,3.4232,0.5929,1.0422,3.8278,3.0582,2.2405,5.8718,2.8229,3.313,0.4323,4.4139,1.2821,0.8236,1.745,0.8377,2.7138,2.6196,4.7767,5.8425,4.7094,1.4412,2.7216,2.4263,3.0151,3.15,2.086,4.4023,0.7058,0.5396,0.6578,0.8995,0.3091,0.0004,5.4884,3.8405,0.2828,0.7823,3.4131,2.0376,2.1232,1.5035,0.0003,0.0004,0.2302,2.1115,0.3898,1.5353,1.151,4.8169,2.7049,1.7254,0.0002,3.1184,2.5489,1.5186,1.7796,1.5716,2.5781,5.8669,2.9609,4.51,0.3687,3.9448,0.8518,6.7059,1.4587,0.7974,0.6207,1.6628,1.4702,1.0012,1.612,0.6924,2.5144,0.4494,5.1671,2.0557,0.3965,6.9256,2.5598,0.7424,4.1567,0.0034,0.0691,0.2114,0.4302,0.0002,3.3846,1.5102,1.1532,4.8856,3.3652,0.0301,1.3221,1.7559,5.3631,1.3929,1.9604,4.3191,0.5249,3.2413,5.0719,1.1,4.2213,0.779,1.9447,2.0727,1.6659,4.3124,1.3559,2.2356,1.2093,0.5895,1.3357,4.0488,0.9625,1.1841,3.7282,2.8778,4.3074,3.8724,1.5851,5.4398,0.0004,0.2202,3.4232,5.3753,1.6954,0.2428,0.0002,3.1506,3.8272,0.8335,1.2621,1.2057,4.7012,1.0792,1.3991,1.0461,4.3601,0.4185,3.7446,0.7241,0.3978,0.3374,2.5272,1.6726,0.4962,2.2735,3.5486,4.4189,3.019,1.474,5.9474,2.0802,1.7272,0.0009,2.6003,2.6003,1.0662,4.6284,1.6512,2.7296,4.0367,0.1702,0.0795,0.955,1.2917,0.0164,0.0022,2.2177,0.4195,1.4176,2.5781,3.9611,4.1108,5.213,1.0808,0.7757,3.7397,3.4785,0.8214,3.8356,6.2391,2.8142,1.1941,0.9483,2.0982,5.0742,0.5856,1.1076,0.5475,0.4047,1.4591,2.7646,3.1673,2.7134,1.9892,2.3282,1.2589,0.0453,2.7406,0.6844,4.5642,0.3173,2.5264,0.5144,0.22,0.2298,0.0002,3.4206,1.5976,2.1874,1.2368,1.9769,4.7194,1.4914,0.3966,3.134,2.5435,7.0557,3.9419,0.224,5.3784,1.4146,7.4487,0.0986,0.141,0.6428,0.9766,0.4742,5.4884,1.1602,1.6613,3.1927,4.7021,2.7607,1.0524,1.8619,5.627,1.2703,0.4861,0.0002,2.8555,1.9451,2.0131,1.0935,2.2249,1.7021,4.2006,3.2046,0.3816,0.5207,6.2838,3.0788,0.6245,1.283,0.4577,0.0034,0.002,0.3034,0.5361,4.7261,0.704,3.8157,0.5848,1.0577,1.8239,4.1367,0.9306,1.843,0.3287,0.6495,1.4615,0.9348,1.7408,2.1873,3.6855,0.5462,1.8828,2.0047,0.2277,4.6171,2.8023,1.6121,3.1237,0.4681,0.1296,0.7822,2.196,1.3633,0.137,0.0002,3.1908,0.0499,0.001,5.27,2.4559,0.257,0.3395,2.5415,0.2926,0.8532,1.365,1.9551,4.9742,1.3104,5.6651,1.3035,1.8426,1.1107,1.7638,2.0512,3.856,3.7125,3.5914,5.5577,2.3526,2.435,3.9725,2.226,0.0092,0.0017,0.8952,2.2651,4.2438,0.1401,0.0008,1.1876,2.0058,0.4428,1.8639,6.4195,0.998,0.9554,2.7533,0.336,2.6709,0.6475,0.8555,2.9281,0.8121,3.7604,0.6016,2.465,0.1253,0.8971,1.7804,0.6958,2.6883,0.8577,1.1015,0.1815,0.436,0.2911,0.0002,5.5806,6.3022,0.7079,1.8253,0.2046,0.3107,0.0793,1.957,1.263,0.0024,0.0025,1.9519,0.4104,2.2528,3.3261,0.1334,2.601,1.3216,3.5553,5.893,5.5626,1.1905,0.9334,5.3758,4.2235,1.5023,0.0003,0.2511,1.3918,3.2172,6.135,3.9739,0.6638,3.1632,0.2157,3.3177,4.0683,1.1108,2.4723,3.7963,5.9294,1.4456,0.1453,1.9837,2.3008,3.6411,1.086,3.7481,0.7457,2.3715,4.6475,0.2011,0.0303,2.1161,0.4592,0.0002,0.9841,0.2203,1.4659,0.9989,0.0021,0.0026,0.8515,1.9959,4.9099,5.6694,1.8092,3.843,0.0197,1.5073,0.5271,3.1782,3.4075,4.7569,1.1335,0.7545,0.0002,1.5422,0.3131,4.2994,5.2902,2.6177,0.675,1.9009,4.5871,3.3763,0.3433,1.3636,0.8258,0.8502,1.2504,1.382,1.549,5.2808,1.6117,2.7544,1.0178,2.1422,0.4967,1.1822,4.6335,1.1734,0.5258,1.3995,5.2933,0.9198,0.5885,1.8136,2.923,4.671,1.8082,5.4434,2.658,0.5237,0.0002,4.0771,5.6044,3.5834,0.1329,0.839,4.5237,1.5221,0.6229,0.6034,0.2336,1.9387,4.7558,2.4732,1.1547,5.4825,1.9306,1.0616,0.0002,3.6786,4.4294,2.5447,2.3745,3.2348,1.1652,1.83,4.881,1.7183,3.9482,0.1335,0.2434,1.2163,2.3864,1.8595,2.6299,1.9298,0.9052,4.8565,0.0014,5.7713,1.0583,2.2297,3.615,1.1501,2.3028,1.3538,0.0013,0.9599,0.3162,0.0456,0.3955,0.0002,4.0232,2.6395,5.438,0.1892,5.1768,2.1688,0.9158,5.2266,1.1525,2.6474,3.1809,5.6232,3.1808,6.4644,5.2181,1.6662,1.6768,1.7225,6.252,1.3527,2.2151,3.3613,2.2055,4.2277,0.3207,4.2414,0.0605,0.0901,0.0097,0.002,4.2913,3.9816,3.0127,1.3828,6.3598,6.1347,0.0691,0.0643,1.7183,0.3226,0.366,1.0404,1.0439,0.115,0.7444,0.0396,0.2116,0.0002,2.8379,3.4808,1.8563,5.4746,1.0689,2.3962,0.0577,0.2152,3.122,3.7009,5.2047,2.66,2.6853,0.5131,4.7413,2.2105,0.9096,1.7718,2.1306,5.9007,5.0753,1.0515,1.4705,5.2425,2.187,3.0193,1.7779,0.1097,2.5971,1.0001,0.4374,0.0002,4.0719,3.1201,0.817,0.3691,4.4168,5.3206,0.9042,0.7671,0.9676,0.5389,4.2522,3.458,1.7114,1.3416,3.4699,4.0799,3.3926,0.9042,3.5552,1.1682,3.0951,4.5808,0.0669,0.9006,1.2544,1.7322,5.4586,4.8907,0.5878,2.6661,2.697,2.3014,5.3813,2.0649,1.4779,4.3633,2.2771,0.6233,1.8077,6.3225,1.2663,1.2311,0.1752,0.1058,0.0235,3.3793,0.2397,3.3636,5.2743,2.9941,2.1897,0.0696,0.2612,4.4052,2.5133,2.3296,5.2178,3.1696,0.5653,0.6412,4.0348,1.3193,1.5744,1.1757]}

{"id":3988,"ended":false,"length":678,"gen_text":"You are turning into Nicolas Cage. The Doctors say there is no cure. You have days at most to set your affairs in order. You are going to have a great year.\n\n\nIt's the day you turn into Bruce Willis. In this movie you are also turned into Christopher Hitchens. A lot of the time it's gonna be a nice show but it has to be really good. This movie is pretty great and its got the most heart.\n\nA man on a mission to destroy Superman. Then he gets thrown out, and his wife saves him. And he goes to go with the army. The heroes were supposed to fight but he didn't. They had to be killed to save our children. They got kicked out of his house.\n\nA girl with long blonde hair who has been trying to destroy his parents, her love for him was crushed because they thought she died but when the parents heard it and saw the destruction they felt it, and they wanted to do something about it.\n\nPeople have made some of the best movies. A time period in America called The Great Depression, in which Americans get on with their lives, and they were like, \"Well, we're gonna give our kids free clothes. But where are the clothes? These kids don't even have their own clothes so we are giving them free clothes.\"\n\nA famous song. It was \"Baby Jesus\" by Tchaikovsky, and it's got the same song over and over. People were like that then as they watched it.\n\nWhat will happen to this world? In a very short amount of time, the world will be changed because of some bad man. The bad man will kill you, and he'll tell you that he is going to kill you. He will tell you that he will take your children away and that if you do not go along with him he will kill them. He will tell you that maybe you will not survive what you did out in the world and nobody knows what he's gonna do about that.\n\nYou know what could bring people peace? If you want help, you can call on one of the heroes and the girl will help you save the world. This isn't what you think about in real life.\n\nA group of kids from The Flintstones is just one of the things that you could do and you think about, if you want to save people over. They had to live with some kind of death.\n\nThey are going to throw it away and put everything away, because it's not in their best interest. No one will be able to save this community. When you really look at it from a humanitarian standpoint it just does not pay any attention to it. We should all understand just how much they would like to have a big life like this because we don't pay any attention to life. A society that would have to live with that does not pay any attention no matter what and if you want to survive life there are no real problems with that.\n\nWell, I think that in a small way this will have changed how I look at it.

{"id":3390,"ended":false,"length":673,"gen_text":"Your girlfriend is a serial killer who has been at large for years. You found out one day upon walking into her apartment and seeing her at work. You never help her with her hobby or express any signs of discomfort when with her and that just baffles her. You just don't care about it. You never talk to her in the way that she would like to and that just wastes away because nobody will say hi to you. You should never worry about her for that long in the woods.\n\nThis could be done on her part.\n\nAnother person said she could use some help and say something to her.\n\nThese are the main reasons she's gone through this: 1) She has no problem with your talking to him. The problem is with the other person.\n\n2) She has no problem with your talking to her because she wants to do with you something you don't want to do or don't want to know what she wants.\n\n3) She wants you to fuck her like this but her own needs can change but she really doesn't want it and is afraid what will happen. She just wants to find a new date with you.\n\n4) She has problems with you. She needs you to do the things she wants you to and when she doesn't want to do anything just tells you that you should have stopped and went home. She doesn't like your talking to her. She even went to some places like this which is so scary because she only cares about what your own needs are.\n\nIn fact, the only ways you can stop trying to fuck her are if you just say no and leave. If you say that then she will find you and you will be okay with it. But if she can't hear you because you're too tired to go away then give up then you can stop trying. If she doesn't agree to be in this place but you know at least you can talk to her at the very first sign of trouble that something could happen if she lets go. No one's going to tell you how to do this if you just will let her hear you.\n\nTo avoid this situation, you could even say that you may be afraid if you leave or tell him she'll have something to go with you.\n\nIf she's so afraid then the only way you can turn away is if she's not doing anything right about it. If she comes over and says you can put a foot up and ask her what's going on now for her and if that'll go on the way. If that doesn't go on the way then you can take her home. If she isn't sure who, where, where to get to where, where this happens then just be quiet and don't. Do her one time when that's all that matters so she can decide what she wants for you.\n\nI really hope this helps someone like you.

{"id":38,"ended":true,"length":643,"gen_text":"Gay marriage is now legal woldwide, and the conservatives were right all along. Everyone is turning gay, as if it was a pseudo zombie apocalypse. You are one of the surviors, trying to survive in this new world.\n\nHowever, that is exactly what they were wrong on. Their strategy to turn away gay people is to make it illegal to have sex with those people.\n\nThey are trying to create a new world, but once they have that, they really lost it right now.\n\nThe question is why are people not using the same tactic \n\nWhen gays were already persecuted and then people began to start using the new tactic, the reaction was that gay people will use it again, but now that they are doing it, they will use it even more to try to protect their country from being destroyed. If you want your country back, don't expect gays to use it. They will do it anyway.\n\nAs the American Revolution started its course, the French were saying, \"You are the only people who understand, and there is no longer anybody who has taken up arms to fight for you.\" The Americans won.\n\nThey were making the enemies in this whole war and when the British attacked from the west, they were not just killing gays, they were killing your citizens.\n\nNow gays use their new tactic, even after they did it, they also will use it in the fight now.\n\nYou do not get 'cuckoo', don't you? This is the reality of life today, and it has got to start with a change that will be huge in the past three decades.\n\nThe problem now for Republicans is that they are losing momentum when the time comes to change America, even though they can't afford it right now.\n\nWe need to take back control of our political parties, a challenge that all their opponents are facing.\n\nIt didn't work with the Republicans in 1984, but they managed to win over Democrats under those same tactics.\n\nThis is what the future is going to look like if they can only win through hard work and hard won battles.\n\nLet us learn from this : change your way of thinking. Don't try to convince yourself something is wrong with you ; try to understand what will happen if you change your thinking about what you believe. Don't allow yourself to be intimidated by anything you think is wrong with your heart.\n\nThe problem that has always been the problem for Republicans is that their current approach to politics is to attack all of their voters.\n\nWe can only hope that this is not the case :\n\nThe GOP needs to be completely destroyed\n\n.\n\nYou must be willing to kill the whole country of America\n\n.\n\nAnd that makes me happy that they are doing this all right just to get their hand on everything that isn't right with God.\n\nIt's not going away\n\n, but now they are starting a new war against Christianity, with an aim of wiping out ALL of it.\n\nIt's the real evil of this country that is giving up.\n\nThis is the American Revolution.\n\nToday I am going to start a new series of books called\n\nHow To Win Friends With Christians, to remind our readers of God's faith in Christians, as well as to give them a reason why they should be thankful for what they don't believe.","token_len":700,"entropy":[8.1319,1.5936,3.7744,1.5397,15.4641,9.2552,10.7242,1.7186,2.1088,2.4428,8.9862,5.455,2.6905,3.0293,0.0119,0.9194,7.4114,2.8721,8.4068,4.9953,2.0076,4.4447,3.2003,2.211,2.4829,1.5984,10.0965,14.1677,1.5989,0.6741,4.9733,3.3114,5.0612,0.5318,0.7482,13.4442,3.4212,1.3617,6.6706,0.1102,2.2909,2.5875,2.0192,3.0322,0.6385,0.7202,1.8865,0.0487,5.5438,0.2343,4.2252,1.5622,3.8222,0.3252,3.3781,2.6494,2.3585,4.3194,0.8786,4.668,5.5411,3.2421,4.0586,4.7789,3.2436,0.7096,1.4627,2.1574,2.7785,1.6855,2.8622,0.9442,2.8355,1.5003,0.3773,5.2771,3.2739,0.9196,2.3689,0.0002,3.079,1.7368,2.8241,0.0389,4.1435,0.5943,2.268,2.3105,2.1938,3.2553,5.9539,1.3403,1.7359,2.4736,1.4403,0.8057,6.083,6.6376,1.7036,7.4832,3.3244,0.1755,1.0721,0.0002,2.5419,5.6514,0.6073,3.1626,2.4986,2.9568,3.4609,3.4592,1.7265,1.5654,3.9111,9.3088,6.3638,0.0003,4.5034,4.9233,2.6396,5.4644,4.854,2.0621,5.2977,4.9663,2.9922,0.6691,4.2987,1.7507,1.173,4.5595,2.6819,1.1992,2.5449,5.0798,0.7257,2.9617,3.4953,0.1422,3.8984,3.962,1.4311,2.2242,2.0806,1.9132,3.3135,2.4206,1.4062,0.9039,3.6513,1.1676,0.7172,1.0577,1.3169,1.7651,0.3859,3.6407,0.2513,4.4266,3.257,0.6532,4.7357,0.9665,5.5926,2.1646,2.4793,2.539,0.7446,5.437,1.6302,2.6821,4.5321,0.4205,3.1787,0.4329,3.5194,0.0016,5.3769,2.8438,0.237,1.5658,0.8971,1.4268,2.8535,1.085,3.6164,0.8971,2.1463,0.6718,0.4597,0.0002,4.3745,2.8372,5.1008,3.5148,2.528,4.9413,2.9923,0.559,1.6961,5.5371,3.2303,4.9066,1.982,0.5704,3.3154,1.7758,2.5338,2.3197,1.8881,0.731,4.8141,3.5559,1.6945,5.0619,0.6679,0.6407,3.6344,4.1575,1.0848,3.5899,6.3696,2.7377,1.5097,1.4727,2.6172,1.1787,1.7119,0.964,2.7866,2.8458,5.7561,2.2978,1.1446,0.0002,3.4244,2.0652,4.8264,2.0392,6.5634,4.3559,3.6031,4.2761,2.4141,3.4215,5.1233,1.5119,3.804,3.9249,6.0563,1.2818,2.2199,0.3881,0.8133,1.6037,3.648,3.9261,3.9887,2.5505,0.781,0.3771,0.0616,1.2866,5.76,4.4022,0.6975,0.8056,0.0002,3.3465,4.8262,5.2681,3.2088,2.3978,1.1984,2.1176,4.8971,4.1164,1.6749,5.3639,1.4461,1.6863,1.4935,5.3818,4.9585,0.8205,0.1509,2.8252,1.5416,4.7676,6.3563,0.7538,0.8754,0.0002,3.8122,4.5191,0.1419,3.7392,6.8001,4.7821,4.3662,2.1835,4.4299,4.8111,0.0051,0.4316,0.2269,4.7409,0.6434,1.7707,5.3105,1.1446,2.8311,2.6716,1.8556,1.5351,1.7752,3.4993,3.9492,0.1238,4.9541,1.612,3.0219,2.5677,4.7649,1.9479,3.3148,5.1491,3.0753,0.7741,5.4798,4.4452,1.1436,0.3333,0.4433,0.0002,2.2868,3.6581,3.7463,4.0261,5.873,0.3776,0.5673,0.7443,1.1254,3.5796,5.3109,4.8455,3.6618,3.3331,0.1503,0.7624,1.7281,4.151,2.6656,3.6823,1.8383,0.8755,3.8039,1.636,3.2797,2.4881,4.0532,0.0019,0.1966,0.5336,0.0002,4.4478,1.9466,0.5456,3.6471,2.9864,1.3142,0.5007,1.0675,3.8936,2.5039,1.3389,6.2461,5.5773,0.6842,5.3474,6.2596,3.1458,1.5676,2.8877,0.8077,0.7854,0.0002,3.3462,7.4859,0.001,2.1219,3.6113,1.4902,2.0525,1.7473,4.6832,0.9177,1.8795,2.0213,4.3535,0.4231,2.0371,2.779,4.4391,6.6179,6.0179,2.1579,1.9591,0.5108,0.5659,0.0002,3.5329,1.0274,2.0111,2.4585,5.1616,3.0177,1.0289,0.0043,0.1627,0.0011,3.0989,2.4691,2.8686,4.1778,2.6922,4.6564,4.179,0.5342,0.9392,2.3336,4.0492,3.4102,0.3887,0.4228,0.0003,5.2552,1.9505,5.5453,0.6092,1.592,9.1991,5.6519,2.207,4.5715,0.0392,0.6561,1.8717,3.3168,0.0009,3.9322,0.154,3.3622,3.2025,6.0025,0.6528,0.6408,1.1071,1.1159,6.2151,3.6158,0.1553,3.741,1.7467,4.7315,0.9014,2.1901,0.3321,2.1848,0.1913,2.6796,4.0913,1.7883,2.2107,2.1289,0.6919,3.901,0.0007,5.0521,1.273,0.0653,0.6001,4.6686,0.3619,5.3831,1.7007,2.5314,0.866,0.3915,0.8367,2.1002,5.1351,0.4311,0.7525,0.0004,3.2575,3.5538,4.2063,3.5468,3.5306,1.2723,2.7992,0.8559,1.2842,1.0287,0.5477,0.3734,3.3318,4.2798,3.0798,1.2644,2.082,0.5813,3.3414,3.9699,3.2277,2.3244,2.1574,6.2544,1.0521,0.5658,0.0002,3.8544,2.5528,2.7282,1.8283,0.3794,2.5529,2.203,1.2527,0.642,0.2642,7.1125,2.7222,0.0002,2.8812,3.4942,3.5417,0.2009,2.9456,4.3515,4.2358,2.9031,0.0002,6.661,0.774,0.0003,4.5238,4.2149,2.3944,2.8581,0.0231,5.2905,2.1223,4.485,2.5006,3.7391,0.8672,2.234,0.0004,0.6874,0.089,0.0002,4.0054,2.583,5.7725,2.8591,3.5833,3.6565,1.9672,0.9149,2.5267,1.0337,4.824,3.8521,6.9812,1.6885,2.6202,2.1955,4.8935,0.6647,5.6397,2.5066,5.1588,0.0012,2.3654,0.7191,7.1624,0.5422,0.4124,0.0004,3.5488,1.5847,2.0965,3.7478,5.2698,3.0359,0.0004,4.7918,1.1467,4.5151,1.5278,0.6253,3.9541,4.2566,0.6971,1.465,2.432,4.2504,2.0257,3.7613,4.232,2.4421,1.0068,4.142,0.2265,5.812,0.7338,3.0183,0.4634,0.2677,0.0002,2.9643,0.797,3.0774,5.1902,4.9741,1.8836,1.755,3.0473,2.1807,1.7077,5.8224,3.0695,2.6106,0.6013,0.0003,3.4318,0.5231,1.3254,5.5944,2.0016,1.6213,0.9076,0.0004,5.5237,3.4927,1.9014,2.1582,0.0263,4.6527,1.7929,0.6478,4.4463,0.8472,3.3802,3.4906,4.9454,0.0002,3.6299,2.9311,2.7862,2.1678,3.2291,3.0953,2.2577,4.3524,5.7299,3.7307,3.7637,1.2783,4.9709,0.2966,5.7763,1.8007,4.3979,1.8781,3.9548,0.3779,0.0126,1.5199,2.9536,0.6079,0.9783,3.4579,2.6153,0.7448,0.652,1.9289,3.8135,0.5251,2.7138,1.3261,5.5557,0.0017,3.4583,0.9702]}
{"id":908,"ended":true,"length":645,"gen_text":"Tell me how you discovered that you were a shapeshifter... I couldn't believe it. I just kind of put it on YouTube.\"\n\nThe man was known as Lopis, although she has denied seeing him that often. The couple said she told him she'd have sex with him after he began training for competition.\n\nThe man denies the proposition.\n\nHe said Lopis, who lives in Miami, told him she had sex with his mother when she was pregnant. The man said she then told him she had been with a man who he met at work but had turned him down because he was a woman. A witness said Lopis said she had had unprotected sex with a man more than twice while they lived together in Houston in 1991.\n\nThe man told police Lopis had the same relationship with the woman after he met her on his way to an airport.\n\nLopis told police Lopis said she asked him if he could make her pregnant, but when he did he said yes, so he didn't have to. Lopis told police Lopis told him she'd had unprotected sex with a man the previous day and then asked him about it, which turned out to be untrue. Lopis said she had already had sex with him when he was pregnant, and that he'd done so because she thought the same thing over and over again. Lopis said as they watched the game, she said she recalled having sex with him \"as if it were the first time you'd ever been with someone.\"\n\nLopis admitted using cocaine and heroin during their relationship. She said she felt very threatened at the time when they found out their relationship was over. She said when they returned to her apartment, they took her phone and a CD off of her belt so she could not read it over her headphones. The man admitted taking the phone back, and he told her she was going to ask for more information.\n\nDuring the alleged incident, Lopis was photographed holding a camera and wearing a blue bikini with three women in swimsuits and a swim dress. A friend also reported the man in a video of him doing cocaine with Lopis. He had one prostitute in the video posing for a picture with his wife and asked the viewer where to go next.\n\nAfter reporting the incident to police, investigators reviewed the records of her son who, like most people, would meet new people for work in the past. They found that the man said he'd been living on his own when he met up with the woman he slept with \u2014 after she saw the video two years ago, he told investigators \u2014 and they would spend nights together there.\n\nLopis told investigators Lopis had told her she was pregnant. Lopis said she felt a little scared that no one would believe her when she brought it up.\n\nFor months, investigators were watching her life, but they never saw much of it. It didn't take long before investigators began to uncover details.\n\nA day after two women told investigators she slept with Lopis, she told her new boyfriend she was concerned that she would be hurt by news of the video to her new boyfriend. The man reportedly wrote messages back to her asking her if she remembered the relationship, which he has told investigators he hadn't seen.\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 The Washington Times, LLC.

I thought this would be more fun than it actually was.\n\nIn Japanese, it means \"a lot of people see people standing in the middle of the stage\". In English, if one of your moves hits a particular person, they can simply turn around again and beat the other person again.\n\n\"It all started with a conversation when I used to have a big question about something on my mind.

There is a Dragon in the beginning and another two in the end when you see it. It also comes from a new location which you can either see in the game by looking straight ahead (the two parts where you don't see things like a wall or in the game by turning round from the corner), or as part of a boss battle (the boss's body is left on the grass).\n\nSee also

Trump said: \"The president of the United States has ordered a full and complete investigation into any possible cover-up in this administration. But I'm told by a member of the FBI that, no, none of what we're seeing, that there's not a problem.\"\n\nBauer denied any connection between his comments and Obama's address in Newtown. \"It was a tragedy,\" he said. \"That's not the way I deal with this.\"\n\n\"He has a criminal record. No, I'm not trying to suggest to anybody that this was a case of somebody playing the victim, because people don't talk about that. So what is his criminal record? Look, this man is no political actor. He's got the same criminal record as any law-abiding citizen that I have. He hasn't earned that reputation. What he did to two young kids, and he did it under the very high risk of the greatest, most heinous act by a terrorist in our country, and he has no idea how to behave.\"\n\nTrump called the attack in a tweet a \"shameful attack\" that occurred \"in my name,\" but he's yet to respond to the comments on Tuesday.\n\nSo let us take a moment out of this weekend and address this ugly attack in my name. Shameful, cowardly, disgusting, hateful. I'll have more to say, because I know exactly what to expect. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 19, 2015\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump said, \"I wouldn't have it any other way. When you have people like this in your country, who are willing to make millions of dollars, that's absolutely unacceptable.\"\n\nAnd Trump appeared to agree with Obama's remarks. \"No one knows who was, but I think that some of these people were radicalized to believe that they were going to be assassinated if it weren't that bad,\" he said. \"I think what he said was, 'Look, if we got this over with, we can fix this.' \u2026 I think that there's much more to this terrible thing that's going on behind the scenes.\"\n\nObama was one of the last major figures to denounce the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2010. He did the same by calling the man who shot his daughters \"the Muslim terrorist of American history.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said on Monday that Obama called the massacre a \"horrific act\" that would \"open fire in your country on innocent children in our backyard and on the American servicemen who took their lives.\"\n\n\"This attack on innocent children in our

{"id":4149,"ended":false,"length":665,"gen_text":"A future dystopian communist society where your career is assigned to you in a letter received on your 16th birthday? Or if your home is raided by bandits?\n\nYou can't do it today because nobody will read them unless you are lucky\u2026 and if the cops keep you to yourself they probably won't arrest you because you are an asshole and you don't know anything.\n\nHow do I live without the law before getting arrested?\n\nThere are two types of laws you need: mandatory minimum sentences for crimes such as stealing, or the minimum order of imprisonment you will need to serve before being sent to prison. While mandatory minimums were introduced at the Great Depression, they have since been used to deter criminals, which is why you should read the Mandatory Minimums: The Forgotten History of the Federal Penitentiary. It tells the story of how mandatory minimums began to take effect, and explains how laws were often harsher and more difficult to enforce.\n\nBefore the Great Depression mandatory minimum sentence laws were imposed. They were particularly popular in southern states, where law enforcement was often able to obtain a harsher sentence for those who broke the law rather than being slapped with a higher charge.\n\nBut they didn't stop at the US State Penitentiary system, which was also the world's great success. While there were other prisons in the US where mandatory minimums were used, this system was simply too expensive and too harsh. The prison system was a perfect fit because it could provide the required minimum, and after three consecutive days of imprisonment, it could be done at least again. It would be an option that even if criminals could have gotten away with the more serious punishment, you would still be required to pay the $40,000 fine, a hefty amount which in the long run was nothing.\n\nNow if you do get caught breaking the law, you will be released. People will call this the Great Depression. I can almost hear the same message from people back home. If people actually try and fix this, they will have no chance of stopping the Great Depression; they will just run after the bad guys and watch as the money runs dry.\n\nSo what about money? I am not suggesting any specific value you can get from working for one of these banks. If you aren't employed in the banking industry for a living, that just means you are earning pennies on the dollar to pay for many of the more risky behaviors you may encounter.\n\nYou Can, But How Long Will You Be Sent to Prison?\n\nThe last thing I want you to take away is your freedom to decide which laws and mandatory minimums you care about best for you. The only time that it's ever going to matter is when you actually get out of prison. It's your life, and it's up to you not to change things. If you are truly a good person and a committed, hardworking citizen, and you are a free thinker, there are many things you can do to help us all make better decisions that don't change things. It's your time and your actions that decide the fate of the American people.\n\nLearn more about how you can help save the lives of thousands of American citizens by continuing to read the article,

{"id":3616,"ended":false,"length":635,"gen_text":"Fantastic Beets and Where to Find Them\n\nIn October, in the year since she first wrote these recipes, Bao had made her first batch of Bao Noodle Cheaper Than Bao, and that's really what she said when she launched into her recent blog post.\n\n\"I said [that] after I had cooked the Bao Noodle recipe, it was about 10 pages of recipes, and that's it. I actually made four new recipes, and all we're doing now is saving all of those. Everything that we've already done, I made for my own use, but our goal is to give you what you want for your own use. I know what you're planning to use, I just wanna make it really good.\"\n\nFor her first batch, she says, the Bao Noodle is slightly cheaper than the other, higher priced versions available at Whole Foods, which are also known as high school versions. She says it also comes with more of the ingredients in line with what you might get on the grocery store shelves.\n\nAnother big ingredient Bao has added to your kitchen is an entire pot of soy sauce. \"What I'm using in this recipe, which is so important, is the way it's made. I did what my recipe asks for, but I don't know how I found those soy sauce.\"\n\n\"We got two days to cut it that day as well, and after three days it was done, and our second batch is just about ready,\" explains Bao Noodle owner, John Lee, who has also done a bunch of other recipes. When she makes these for her family, they come out well-dressed and have very little water in them. She didn't even test these, just took them out for a quick test drive.\n\n\"We tried a few different recipes at the kitchen table, and it worked out so well with these. I was really pleased, but you know what? It's not going to help you, because not even the ones at Whole Foods have the soy sauce on the ingredients of the Bao Noodle I am using. So even as you're frying it, if you can put a little extra soy sauce on it, it will turn out just right.\"\n\nBao doesn't have to cut the veggies to get the perfect consistency -- the first batch had just 1.2 tablespoons of water, so you'll need some to make it a tad more palatable.\n\nIf you are looking for one of these that won't be sold at Whole Foods, you can always reach out to my friend Dalia at my online store for a set to sell. (He also runs the Healthy Bao Mom's Food blog.)\n\nBao Noodles\n\nIngredients: Soya, Soybean, Water, Pepper, Sesame, Worcestershire Sauce, Peppermint Sauce, Peanut Butter, Olive Oil, Sorachi rice (the soy sauce also adds a little sugar to the sauce, which makes it a little more palatable), Garlic, Salt, Parsley, Creme Blend, Caraway seeds, Cinnamon Blend, Caramelized Butter, Coconut Oil, Green Garlic, Honey Nut Butter, Black Pepper, Garlic Sugar\n\nPrice: $6.90 from Gather Together\n\nImage Credit: Cooking Bao Noodle\n\nThe Bao Noodle Print Cooked in 12 Min -

The demonic body is also summoned through the portals in the dungeon dungeon. By pressing \"S,\" the demon body shows up inside the dungeon dungeon using the white circle icon and can be seen using light sabers, so in effect this summoning is actually a magic summon. One can summon a demon in the dungeon dungeon in order to summon a demonic body with the same form.\n\nThe summons can be used at time limit for different tasks (eg. summoned at the moment of being summoned from the portal, summoned with the demon body) and some special summons can also be used. For example, when used at the right time after the summoning at night.\n\nOnce summoned at the appropriate time, a demon will appear in the dungeon again using the original portal, with the demonic body in front of it.

The summoning time is counted if it is higher than that.\n\nIf there is a delay (if it does not already happen), a demonic body will appear. After the summoning, when the summoning is over there, the demon body will turn gray. Then the player can talk to the demon body.\n\nThe summoning time does not affect the time of the demon and if you are hit in front of the demon body you can still summon the demon body once it becomes grey after it is defeated. It will reappear later at different times of the day.\n\nA demon body can only be summoned when you use it at the same time as your soul is alive. The demon body cannot be summoned by summoning it while it is alive because the demons don't want to kill a human even in the absence of a soul.\n\nIn the dungeon dungeon the demon summoning lasts only an hour.

{"id":189,"ended":true,"length":664,"gen_text":"Scientists correctly guessed when a massive solar flare would reach Earth but they were wrong on what would happen once it got here.\n\n\"It was only a year ago that scientists first put the blame on the sun because of the planet's extremely hot conditions,\" says Martin S. Schooldt, a physicist at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics and principal investigator of the study published in the journal Science today.\n\nHe says the discovery of this phenomenon at the dawn of science and astronomy could lead to significant advances in understanding how the sun goes around our solar system, which in turn could lead to applications for other instruments and space telescopes for detecting unusual phenomena.\n\nBy studying such phenomena, scientists can use any instrument or telescope at our disposal to study the activity inside our solar system.\n\n\"This makes it easier for us to understand its nature and use telescopes to see what it looks like,\" Schooldt says, describing an upcoming work at the Institute for Advanced Study at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany.\n\n\"With this discovery, we hope to get more out from the sun's observation, like this one, so that it becomes visible to us as it goes around the planet where it might give clues about how it has formed,\" says Martin Stu\u00dfknecht, chief of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany, and research associate of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Hannover.\n\nIn the present study, researchers compared three different solar flare signals, each one for different groups of stars, and examined their patterns using a large telescope. The researchers then measured their patterns in the light from each signal and their effect in the light from each of the other three. Schooldt says the measurements suggest that the signals have a similar effect on the light generated by each signal. At different speeds the solar flares can cause the signal to burst, causing the planets out in the middle and back to be seen when it goes about their course, while during other times its brightness might drop.\n\nAccording to Schooldt, one of the main challenges of studying flares is that they affect a lot of different things. The researchers do not yet have a solution to pinpoint the exact mechanism of why a solar flare could do this, or what should be done with the sun's energy supply, but they suspect that the problem may now be handled better using more sensitive devices.\n\nThe authors say that they don't know how to correct the flares, but this study does provide an opportunity to investigate how these particles can create such huge solar flares.\n\n\"We can now understand how our sun does the right thing when a very large amount of energy is present within a particular wavelength range and that there's enough energy in the universe at one point to cause the Earth to vibrate at such a high temperature,\" they say.\n\n\"Another new idea is to study a way in which there are many different regions of Earth, even very small ones, where the sun is visible for about as long as light travels at different speeds, and when that duration changes the sky can be seen as different parts of the planet move slowly, which in turn shifts the solar flare's path,\" adds Stu\u00dfknecht. The work published today also suggests that a new technology may be under development to help humans understand how much energy the sun has as it becomes present on Earth.\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 The Washington Times, LLC.

The final is titled Anime-Minami Akoi: Shoukan Ken: Ch\u014dkan Saionette, which aired in 2008. The fourth movie is called Anime-Marihime Hosei no Ken: Kanzenky\u016b J\u016bj\u014dshi, which premiered in 2011. The fifth and final ending, released on April 14, 2011, starred RONIRA RIKA as Tsurugi, a girl of a similar age from the third anime set, with who is also the daughter of ANBRA.

{"id":4475,"ended":true,"length":664,"gen_text":"Your character's house is both very haunted and very concerned about your character's emotional well-being... and one that makes the character feel like something that belongs to them\n\n'The house is also filled with things that feel real and valuable to you, and that you have to help your character through.'\n\nHe explained that he would make up his own narrative and 'he [the protagonist of the movie] wants to make a strong and original story where he is able to take it all into his own realm'\n\n'It is important to me that my character make up his own narrative and be able to take on all aspects of it,' he explained, with 'those aspects being what makes his stories work and what keeps his story alive.'\n\n'He's a smart, strong, smart, successful guy but also an easygoing, but also really vulnerable character, who likes to run away from himself and his people and not really think about anything beyond what's bothering him, so I'm very much looking for those'real' aspects of his personality.'\n\nBut when it comes to real life, Mr. Kukuro says, it has to do with how you live your life.\n\n'To be one of the most vulnerable people in the world (and in the world now) is extremely difficult,' said Mr. Kukuro, who has been homeless for 18 years.\n\n'I could always say that you must start living a little more comfortable as you find your way out of it. What you face and what will you become and how you go about learning to survive is very important to you and as a result, it must become you. When you live in this part of the world at the beginning, your first thoughts have very little to do with what you live,' Mr. Kukuro added.\n\nHe said that you need time to recover from the hardships of life, take responsibility for yourself, and focus on getting stronger and happy when you are ready, as well as taking care of your children.\n\nBut despite his tough exterior, he said he has kept his family and the 'troubled' relationship with him alive with some hope that they won't turn around\n\nThe author of The Life of Walter Hsu has had one of the most intense moments for him and has been able to make the world's worst people happy...\n\nIn the book, published today, he revealed that he took his own life as he wrote the book because it was about someone he felt that was the best he could ever have known\n\n'Every good thing and every thing that I did (be it fame or my life), that was my character, all of these good things were worth it because that's how much they made me happy,' Mr. Kukuro told the Daily Mail.\n\n'I'd go the way of the good man and go like a guy who had no life. I did the same by helping others to have life, but I needed to take responsibility for my life.'\n\nThe author of The Life of Walter Hsu, Mr. Kukuro's most recent book, also explained that he was born

{"id":3558,"ended":false,"length":695,"gen_text":"Describe a universe in which entropy increases from east to west rather than from past to future.\n\nConsider the universe in the way that it is represented in the previous sentence, for example:\n\nIn the second sentence, there is no such thing as an empty universe. The universe as represented by the second sentence is nothing but a place within infinite time. [An earlier version [of this sentence] had omitted this part.] The second sentence is also omitted in this sentence: If we add three things in the universe to represent the past we would be able to use all three of them to represent the present; if we add nothing else we could only use the second sentence as an empty universe\u2014it is not one of those two situations.\n\nThe first sentence can be rewritten as\n\nIf we add some new things, and add nothing else but new things we could only use the new things to represent the past, and there is nothing in the universe beyond zero, we would have to give rise to a world beyond zero in order to represent the present in any way we want. [The original sentence had some new details, like this: If you add new things, but you cannot change them, your next world will be one after zero in your second, which will not be an empty universe.] In practice, the world that we put above is an empty cosmos, but even if you added something in the second sentence the same thing would still be represented because it is already the present. As long as you add nothing else, the universes you represent will still be nothing beyond zero in their present form; it will be represented, then, as the present, as a place beyond infinite time. So this part of the sentence is the beginning; the universe as represented by the first sentence is simply empty of all future values (as in any world beyond time; see also Time.]\n\n[The sentence could be rewritten as\n\nWe are just starting from this one sentence. If we add nothing else, this is an empty universe. However, if we add something else at some point in the future (within a given time duration) we would still be represented as a future value (i.e. a time value).\n\nThe second sentence is: If we add nothing else, one cannot represent the past by adding nothing and there are no new values in the universe after that; if we add nothing else, nothing remains in the world. If we add nothing else and it does not contain new values, we can not be represented as a future value.\n\nThe present can only be represented by three values, and so cannot represent any other present values at all. The only time that two universes can be represented by these three values is the one that is created by three future values, and it is never created in the previous iteration of this sentence. In order to represent the past, one needs to place all these three values in a way that they are not in the past by adding one to the present, but only that they contain new values in the future by adding one at some point in the future.\n\nThus the final two sentences can be rewritten as follows:\n\nIf there are no new values in the future, the universe will remain in its present form (since nothing new has been put in it).

{"id":4154,"ended":false,"length":684,"gen_text":"There are two life supporting planets in the same solar system. Each one has a sentient species who've evolved roughly along the same rate technologically. Write a story using that.\n\n. The planets are found almost everywhere except in the solar system.\n\n. Many of the planet forms are alien life forms, although some are known for being Earth based. The planet worlds may be called xenos life forms, though some do exist. Many of Venus's habitable zones are located in space.\n\n, although some exist. The planet worlds may be called, though some do exist. Many of Venus's habitable zones are located in space. A planet called Elam (or Elam Prime planet ) would be able to live out the rest of its life. This would be an important one as it would allow humanity's most advanced research to progress while also allowing for them to build more advanced technologies.\n\nThis trope can also be found in some forms of the Universe.\n\n. As part of their research, a colony colony has taken over a planet called Elam (or Elam Prime planet ). This may refer to a species inhabiting another planet. A species might not be on a planet, like Venus or Elam Prime.\n\n. Many of Earth's planets (such as Mars, Jupiter, Saturn ) are inhabited, which may or may not change the way they talk.\n\nThe \"universe-like\" planet is an even more exotic planet found in the Solar System of other planets (such as Pluto and Saturn ). The planets are called 'trees' that can grow within large trees like many different ecosystems, and these trees are known as trees (and if necessary, trees have a'space' in them ). In space, their roots are formed by volcanoes that send water into a mountain range below their surface to flow through.\n\nAn asteroid called Deoxyn may be a perfect specimen. At least eight of them exist in this part of the Solar System; two of each reside close together orbiting one another. An even more exotic planet may be found in any other star system.\n\nIn any story of Star Trek, any alien from one galaxy or culture might be present at the next round. In any story with aliens from different planets, even small aliens, there is some likelihood that one of them will try to harm one of the other. However, in some stories that are based on the real world, it appears that aliens from many different civilizations may be found in close proximity. A little known trope happens, where a planet with some unusual characteristics becomes a planet in the story. The alien must then either take her back to earth or stay in Earth and be assimilated into Earth (if it exists at all). It seems to happen all over all human cultures, including even the aliens (since there's much of it on Earth). This would seem to be the most common use of alien-derived technologies, with the exception of the many times where a civilization found alien culture, and never sent them in for genetic research (with no guarantee that they would be able to use them for purposes other than making intelligent races). In many of these cases, the alien culture was never brought back to life by a human to save it, which eventually leads to the alien alien making a new civilization, and then a new life (or two). So, when one of the new civilizations found alien culture and killed it, they are considered alien to the person or the culture on Earth.\n\n\nVideo Games\n\nWindows\n\nWestern Animation\n\nReal

{"id":4022,"ended":false,"length":686,"gen_text":"Write whatever you want, as long as a rubber duck plays a major role in the play.\n\n\nThis way you don't have to worry about your own safety because nobody will play them unless you tell them to.\n\nJust keep in mind, they're not allowed to play on the other side of that.\n\n-I said you could use some help and say something like \"I've been looking for this and he's still waiting for it.\" If it works, you're in for plenty of trouble.\n\n-Even so, if your character can perform the role, he will never know that you killed him since he is a small dude. A normal guy. If you use your actions wisely, you'll never accidentally kill your fellow party members. Everyone in the game knows that this was possible because they have a reason to make your character look stupid and stupid.\n\n-Of course, there are many reasons why you killed him. Just remember, he's not the guy you want to kill. It turns out he is.\n\n-While having your character die should not be hard, killing one member of the party for killing your own is very easy.\n\n-As mentioned, even if you did your job, it will still be painful. Especially now that he's dead, you can put him back where he was when you started. This is especially true if you got the same reaction over and over. When he returns that same reaction, he will know you played a role, but it will be extremely uncomfortable to hear he died because you gave him a good reason to talk, then gave him the bad reason to kill you, so he'll tell you \"But he did his job well.\"\n\n-The very idea of having your character die is a bad strategy because it implies that you are playing a game about you killing enemies so you want to kill him. I wouldn't be out there killing people for fun, and never even trying!\n\n-One more thing that will make him happy is the fact that you'll have to wait until after leaving the party before killing the big three monsters in turn. In any case, I am trying to do this as part of the game rather than as a part of a mission.\n\n-Another good thing is that monsters and missions are just a little bit different. On the other hand, I really want to kill more than 1 enemy at a time.\n\n-One last thing is that some of you might not be in the game, but I want you to take a look at your character and kill him and be happy!\n\n-Oh and remember that my friend told me to not kill him all of the time. He would not kill him every time he had something nice done to him, which was not the case, he was just more happy playing games with the team, than being angry about no good thing ever being done in game.\n\nFor you, we need to do a little bit more, don't you think? It would be awesome to have no character with a reason to fight you, just to be happy.\n\n\nSo, that's it folks! The world has changed for me in a big way, and I am going to continue to work on the games that work best for me.\n\nFor more information regarding The Elder Scrolls, I am currently teaching my students at UCLA, and also looking to do further research on the game, which I could even do to my own.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

{"id":2173,"ended":true,"length":706,"gen_text":"A conjurer from the next universe over summons an eldritch demon from beyond the realm of knowledge, you. A normal person from THIS universe. A wizard from HERE that has the power to kill or summon demons. Or you could simply use your wand and make up for any difficulty you have with the spell, and that's all there is to it. Anyhow, on with those.\nYou probably understand right now that all this is rather mundane compared to the rest of your life. And what might have been a difficult life that didn't actually exist is now a new one, one that we're forced to live with daily.\nBut now that we've covered a few things about conjuring dragons, here is our next list\u2014\nYour first question is very important\u2014I bet many people who know magic know that conjuring dragons has no magical value. Many of you probably already know that conjuring dragons use magic to deal with demons and the like, which means it's unlikely there is much magic here. A few people who have seen things like that are quite skeptical of conjuring dragons. I imagine most people don't understand that when a dragon enters your realm, magical stuff gets pumped up and starts getting summoned to do your bidding. No, I'm talking about the magic to give the dragon some force to hold it back (and to stop the summoning from happening, either.) So what if you just turned around and summoned an elf demon from nowhere, and then left your home for a few more weeks? When would it be fair as hell to summon an elf that isn't an actual dragon like you?\nSo, let's go over the list we're using to give you a general idea of where the dragons are on our lists, starting with this list of spells that we're able to summon.\nThe first two spells on your list that have a \"dragon,\" or something like that, are from here on out.\nWe can now name a few more spells that don't work in this list, though, and with these you can start seeing some options for what to choose from. I'll have more detailed spell lists coming soon.\nWith that said, if something works better with the new version, it might make sense to simply add something to the original list, or you can select one you've already found somewhere and continue your search for things that should work better with the new version of the spell. You may not need to specify what to want to specify, but it might make sense.\nWe've already discussed how to put some random stuff off in our dragon lists to avoid that sort of thing. What about if it's something that we have really good reason for, or is something our own creation wanted to use more than it actually ever should.

What happens next? In Episode VI, The Lord of the Rings has a dream-like state where he cannot wake up, and Anakin is unable to.\n\nIn Episode VII, In the movie, Lucas mentions Dark Horse.\n\nIt is stated that Anakin's birthday is July 1, and it is mentioned repeatedly in the scene where Skywalker rides past The Emperor. On the other hand, Lucas does specify that Anakin would be able to get back at Vader by \"firing blaster bolts\" into him, which is confirmed by the cutaway of Luke's \"Falling Star Battle\". Although the scene in the film makes some sense as it is a moment during the Rebellion during the battle, it also is contradicted by the movie. It is also not clear however whether Anakin would be able to achieve his goal during the Battle of Endor in the final confrontation with Vader in any way or form. In fact, during the battle, Luke tells Palpatine after the fight that he was worried Vader might be defeated. Anakin's own dream is then also confirmed by the Force Unleashed cinematic set in the Star Wars: Star Wars: Episode VII: Revenge Of The Sith.\n\nThere is a scene in Episode VIII in which Anakin takes Palpatine aside in a private booth. The two are interrupted by Darth Vader who is trying to convince the audience to come out of their seat and sit down under the chair; it is also confirmed, then commented upon by a StarWars.com listener, in the film this is actually a time at the beginning when Luke has been in the Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace (as he appears in the trailer before Episode VII ), so Anakin can take the Force out of him. In The Force Unleashed, it is mentioned that Anakin's parents are going through some problems related to his father's passing; in the trailer, they say that Anakin will take one more step before the film even begins.\n\nis a time at the beginning when Luke has been in the Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace (as he appears in the trailer before ), so Anakin can take the Force out of him. In The Force Unleashed, it is mentioned that Anakin's parents are going through some problems related to his father, so Anakin can take the Force out of him. In The Legend of the Jedi: Palpatine and Yoda on the moon, Yoda has a crush on Anakin for being the one who told him to stay out of all of Kenobi's plans. In the final version of the film, Yoda and Yoda's \"child\" talk about Alderaan. In the novel, they learn that Jabba's Palace has no proper library of any way to store Jedi holocrons. This is implied to have been mentioned by Anakin in their last conversation about \"how to be a Jedi\" during the film, but in the novel, Jabba's Palace is listed as one of Kenobi's private libraries.[1]\n\n\" The Jedi Master and the One True Jedi \"\n\nThe Dark Master has also expressed an interest in Anakin when speaking to the Grand Admiral about the Millennium Falcon, possibly leading him to the Jedi Temple. Anakin's interest was further suggested by the Star Tours Star Wars : The Phantom Menace (2005) movie teaser trailer video for the movie.\n\nReferences","token_len":728,"entropy":[9.0524,5.7228,8.5834,0.097,0.0011,9.0705,5.3955,0.0072,0.0002,4.4934,6.9788,0.0008,2.868,5.0241,0.5119,1.4085,7.702,2.8157,1.0576,1.2532,1.0164,0.0085,0.9058,0.0589,0.0006,0.001,0.0015,0.0004,0.0001,0.0004,0.0009,0.0002,0.0002,0.0014,0.0023,0.0528,0.0007,0.0049,0.0043,0.0017,0.0071,5.836,2.2872,3.2581,1.0755,4.2002,5.7641,0.0286,0.0371,0.0497,5.666,1.7956,5.4928,5.6478,0.1318,3.0069,1.8182,0.9826,4.7287,4.8249,1.3032,2.1086,1.7813,5.1191,0.0004,1.8778,3.5249,0.0065,2.2366,1.5907,0.0002,1.1791,0.4768,0.7786,0.1855,5.1804,1.6065,4.7705,1.2833,6.0711,4.8398,6.4571,4.5568,4.3488,0.9702,0.0002,5.7396,0.8021,3.3031,0.7771,3.0807,0.0011,2.2422,6.1039,0.3809,3.7053,3.2931,0.9095,3.5552,3.1812,0.5301,3.6193,7.0733,0.992,0.7229,6.1142,0.8189,4.5099,5.7107,5.1051,4.1007,3.7178,1.5679,5.8099,1.1597,2.4006,0.0336,0.0284,3.9178,3.0565,7.0473,0.4273,1.5444,0.0013,3.4247,1.1954,3.321,0.0052,3.2298,2.177,3.9721,3.4501,2.7495,3.9249,4.3244,1.4589,5.9227,0.7181,1.9844,4.0339,2.6608,1.5709,1.7115,1.2454,4.6675,0.7677,1.3683,4.8416,3.3499,1.7851,2.9705,1.638,4.1991,4.5978,4.2983,0.8399,7.028,1.5454,5.9636,2.3536,3.2416,3.0043,1.7897,2.0147,5.4417,5.2573,2.8229,2.9624,1.7392,1.6197,2.0498,5.1024,3.4521,0.8468,4.9469,4.499,1.4596,2.575,1.3333,0.9167,2.7329,3.8348,3.669,0.1649,0.7815,5.2014,1.8222,3.3251,0.4676,0.9008,4.0025,2.224,7.9493,2.1175,1.0246,0.0007,1.6781,1.3598,0.0943,0.0123,5.1155,2.3073,0.7505,3.9171,0.7433,2.6948,0.2164,0.8978,0.0001,2.9926,0.9755,3.1548,3.6265,1.1136,0.728,3.1958,6.3068,1.1819,3.6907,0.9232,0.5737,3.2832,2.4756,0.0748,4.4122,0.4566,1.9272,0.5139,2.3744,4.2555,4.2934,0.0005,0.0004,4.5192,1.7184,3.351,0.3198,0.9339,2.705,5.0116,3.4762,1.9812,2.3905,5.3635,1.4272,3.6542,0.0018,2.1826,5.7206,4.1871,1.9796,4.7251,4.3272,2.5826,0.8447,0.8646,6.3182,4.6546,4.4767,5.755,2.0949,1.2338,3.1798,0.0233,0.7045,4.8303,0.0597,1.2088,1.0957,1.3062,1.8074,0.9467,4.063,0.002,0.0011,1.3949,0.5637,0.0001,4.9638,0.5981,1.2311,2.1114,0.8683,1.7649,1.766,2.0719,0.0317,1.0078,0.0004,4.7923,3.6466,0.0017,0.0006,4.4362,3.5368,1.6412,3.4349,5.9393,1.964,2.1457,2.4404,2.6114,3.8257,0.1998,2.8857,0.1208,2.5089,2.0036,3.4105,0.0103,3.7845,2.6164,2.2343,1.2304,3.8186,2.5164,0.7311,2.0586,3.8104,1.8292,5.2788,0.8692,5.6458,0.9909,3.751,5.4035,4.4498,0.2981,1.8244,1.765,5.3672,5.2907,5.4768,1.2659,1.7134,3.8935,4.1351,3.9908,0.3403,0.1253,5.0573,0.4249,4.1766,1.1833,3.9948,5.854,1.4689,2.9392,1.6257,5.317,6.07,1.4596,3.4395,3.2635,2.928,4.1978,2.6781,3.0227,1.2587,2.5915,0.1644,0.7178,0.5494,3.562,2.0352,0.1147,0.0023,0.0009,0.0001,3.7337,3.6334,2.1579,4.3479,0.7352,0.745,5.2346,4.8148,4.3989,1.5514,5.3531,4.149,2.138,0.0008,2.9887,3.7638,1.874,4.8529,2.1877,0.1119,1.587,1.265,2.9505,3.8149,0.741,0.1027,1.2728,2.794,0.1864,2.8811,0.508,0.7884,0.001,2.2636,4.1854,2.0287,5.5698,2.5357,2.8571,3.6242,5.6261,0.006,1.7069,2.7709,1.0886,4.7695,3.4847,2.7926,0.9503,3.1394,0.6339,2.7094,3.1073,0.7935,1.5484,0.002,3.0747,4.5832,5.7463,2.4788,2.17,2.807,2.9133,5.5576,4.2366,1.2023,0.4562,0.9494,0.0002,4.7873,2.6642,0.0819,0.0141,0.0034,0.0105,0.084,0.0291,0.0054,0.0031,0.0027,0.0057,1.8602,0.0007,0.1329,0.7709,0.5888,0.011,0.0074,0.0009,0.0015,0.0025,0.0095,0.0038,0.0034,0.0003,0.0037,0.014,0.0114,0.0103,0.5043,0.0127,0.0023,0.0021,0.0055,0.001,0.0019,0.0104,0.0004,0.0007,0.0021,0.0009,0.193,0.3922,0.0565,0.0,0.0014,0.0033,0.0021,0.0252,0.0013,0.0116,0.0017,0.3633,0.002,0.0054,0.0032,0.0044,0.0015,0.0202,0.0019,0.0006,0.0015,0.0014,9.6879,0.9182,0.0009,0.0037,0.0212,0.0028,0.1119,0.0177,0.0004,0.0012,0.0019,0.0013,0.6834,1.5792,6.5494,0.1443,1.2479,1.5491,2.5184,4.7474,0.0003,0.0025,2.5838,4.6387,0.0121,5.3122,1.2547,3.9725,1.646,3.1971,0.0021,3.5819,1.4424,6.2576,0.014,1.0528,0.0002,4.1253,2.5708,2.1463,2.2097,0.5268,4.4356,0.8372,1.1616,3.6278,2.6748,0.0672,6.6867,1.5633,5.8085,0.0834,2.7748,0.8316,2.6607,0.7732,3.9783,4.8438,0.3337,0.5202,1.4683,0.1449,1.6464,0.0005,2.9185,2.6039,0.0169,2.9684,4.9646,4.9676,0.8613,5.6796,0.4557,5.3002,0.7417,0.0009,2.1026,2.4129,0.5946,4.5836,1.3669,2.9644,5.6229,0.7284,6.3915,1.0475,2.5007,0.3227,3.1105,4.3484,5.6001,5.6693,2.619,4.0636,8.1578,0.5118,1.3466,3.3431,5.1534,0.8972,0.0872,1.2908,3.1706,0.9012,4.3924,1.1526,2.7871,0.5863,4.9776,1.5138,2.7377,0.001,1.6815,5.8967,4.4484,0.9328,4.187,5.1184,4.2595,0.9508,3.3407,0.8761,0.1852,1.6568,2.7327,0.5595,3.9747,1.7262,2.0452,2.8378,0.5759,1.1616,0.8304,3.2437,0.0112,0.7048,0.0756,1.1772,5.5468,0.3376,3.2664,0.2059,4.5908,0.0043,3.4623,1.8545,4.466,2.1557,0.0535,0.3784,0.0002,4.908,3.1407,3.4967,3.1422,3.5492,2.0382,5.3311,1.8695,1.9554,1.3896,1.4438,0.0002,2.4959,5.8539,6.2035,3.814,4.7094,5.0133,2.4915,0.1016,0.0153,1.5874,0.0003,4.164,4.5618,0.6121,3.0564,5.131,3.1976,1.8151,1.4343,4.9463,0.0013,1.8825,5.2495,5.481,1.5728,0.1691,3.942,3.2077,0.936,0.9973,3.0,0.0013,2.5554,2.7407,2.8367,3.2895,4.5317,0.7381,1.6396,4.1492,3.9836,4.3771,1.1261,6.0651,1.4289,2.0883,0.0047,0.0014,3.5276,4.2176,0.5943,3.3919,5.3

{"id":1983,"ended":false,"length":671,"gen_text":"A new invention enables people to remember their dreams with absolute clarity. It turns out we were forgetting them for a very good reason.\n\nIn fact, in the year 2000, scientists discovered that the age of self recall was indeed 20 years old. And it also turned out we were remembering for the first time our dreams.\n\nThis could change once people realize that we are really capable of being creative and creative after all and when the creative people see this moment, they will forget much less.\n\nHere is how it works,\n\nWhen your brain turns on, we are forced to remember that all your dreams were true! This is how we can learn to manage fear, sadness, boredom, anxiety, and the rest of us.\n\n(I bet they know what a dream is!)\n\nDon't worry about the details of this invention! When we have a dream, we can see what it means to us!\n\nWe are able to imagine in our dream and the experience. Just like learning about some of the other world. We can make more progress in our dreams than we thought and when we feel confident and satisfied, we will be like this :\n\nYou know what your dreams are like! They can be even better! Enjoy one of the amazing inventions of the 2000's (the great success of computers ).\n\nYou do not need to write down every dream you have ; you just need to make every detail very clear and beautiful. It makes perfect sense because if your dreams are as clear and vivid as you want them to, then it will come out better than if you just don't realize it at first!\n\nWe have a solution to all this problem! In our dreams, we tell the experience of our dreams at the beginning when we feel all their happy endings. When we notice that each ending is happy and happy, we find that we are truly happy.\n\nWe can now share our experiences over email, social media, in real life and finally, whenever with kids. And it may even help them become super creative people!\n\nIn any dream, the way you remember your dreams is more than just something the big picture.\n\n(What if we did not know that we are talking about actual people? Or rather, that we are talking about actual selves? That is the question we should ask ourselves!)\n\nSo, the world we are living in.\n\nDon't worry!\n\nYou will not need a dream machine to dream, it is so simple!\n\nFor people who are very skilled, they can use the device easily!\n\nBut that is not really a dream!\n\nYou do not need a Dream machine like the Dream machine that we are all familiar with!\n\nThere is also a lot of other great possibilities!\n\n\nImagine your own dream machine\n\nTake a look at this picture!\n\nThere are several new features of this dream machine!\n\nOne is new form factor in the user mode!\n\nAnother is new input parameters (the functions of each function will be changed to their values in the user mode)!\n\nA new icon is available!\n\nAnd one new function!\n\nYou can customize your dream machine

Also, the new players can be summoned with the same unit from the same room and the same units from the same room. When moving units outside, the player can easily switch groups with the same group inside by pressing both keys simultaneously.\n\nTrivia Edit\n\nThe player who enters a combat window is never the game's character. They are just a door to the main level and will only be shown through the windows when the game is in your inventory.\n\nIn previous incarnations, players could enter a combat window as they died, but with an invisible sign that a corpse has been knocked upon returning to the game.\n\nAccording to the player, in any case, playing a game with a window that is completely separate from a floor should be avoided. The only time this happens is when the player is looking through the front door of their window during combat or when using an invisible spell when moving units, or when moving into a place where they die when the window is completely closed.\n\nIt is unknown how many times a player has to enter a combat window to get back into it. When this is done one cannot enter the final stage for another player, yet still being on the same level after using the spell to gain a new level.\n\nIn the beginning phase of the game with windows, certain units are invisible until the player enters a level, however, that can potentially happen by either casting a spell they found on the ground, or if they were inside the main level for a while and saw the window.\n\nIn all multiplayer games, there is an exception to the rule whereby players can only see the main level for one second (if they used a separate weapon). However, they can enter a combat window that no longer lasts and exit in a way that is not blocked in the main mode by the player.\n\nThe only time in which a player's \"move\" command is executed is during a level, so in such situations the command is not executed by itself.\n\nAt the beginning of the level, when switching to either a new mode, the \"move\" command is executed immediately upon the player moving to a new position, when the player's \"move\" is used, the player has already switched to a new enemy.\n\n\nVideo Games

Apes).","token_len":734,"entropy":[8.6612,5.0589,10.1651,0.3872,3.876,8.3056,1.1168,8.0269,7.0471,0.7316,2.7255,5.7288,10.0832,1.909,0.7035,2.9183,0.4505,5.3093,9.8276,2.7028,4.9122,1.4757,9.5852,1.4698,1.42,4.5415,4.3533,1.0307,2.2887,0.0122,7.1305,4.6558,8.8929,0.6234,0.8673,0.0155,0.0984,0.0028,0.0125,0.0011,0.0031,0.0009,0.0003,0.0016,5.8645,3.6276,5.4886,3.6017,1.4638,3.2352,3.2281,1.2725,3.8155,2.3316,2.0496,2.2892,5.6555,5.0996,5.2346,1.5203,2.4491,4.8351,1.7986,0.2207,1.1162,0.0003,6.6241,4.565,0.0351,0.0219,0.0036,0.0023,0.0019,0.0119,0.0011,2.1366,3.1699,2.6215,5.6021,0.7301,1.7791,4.7388,1.0211,4.2753,2.9619,4.4977,4.9455,1.0959,0.682,3.4376,0.0173,2.0072,4.5346,2.4422,2.6863,0.7841,3.4751,0.0006,0.1221,0.4077,6.6887,0.0015,6.4784,0.8466,5.456,6.0682,3.0909,1.9238,4.8987,4.2607,5.4794,4.3662,3.9939,3.9344,3.0579,0.1702,0.5071,5.4141,5.0763,1.0764,2.0883,0.9832,4.4581,0.0414,6.4646,0.1934,1.2975,2.4346,1.7942,3.2543,3.7715,2.0882,3.5426,2.5124,4.2596,0.5752,3.1708,2.0459,2.6274,2.8514,1.9643,2.4175,2.0449,0.324,1.403,3.2922,1.7174,4.4395,2.986,0.3644,0.5996,0.4171,0.0002,5.126,6.488,0.0103,0.0044,0.0025,0.0035,0.0076,0.0028,0.056,0.0005,0.0007,0.0029,0.0217,0.0052,0.0013,0.0012,0.0013,0.0041,0.0034,0.0123,0.0019,0.0017,0.0016,0.0006,0.0007,2.6443,3.958,4.5101,1.519,3.4723,1.8062,0.8586,6.072,4.3335,4.4778,1.6284,5.2897,0.8624,1.1601,5.6256,0.0004,6.0161,2.8739,5.1799,5.7622,1.7274,1.2783,3.62,1.0929,3.2242,3.2055,2.0671,0.8478,1.0612,0.0002,5.3563,0.0011,0.1323,0.002,0.0021,0.0126,0.0006,0.0023,0.0324,0.0023,0.0084,0.0092,0.0062,0.0046,0.0018,0.0016,0.0134,0.0009,0.0008,0.0021,0.0039,0.001,5.2559,2.2276,2.8538,5.7277,2.0601,2.6624,1.4231,4.2201,4.2235,0.7674,0.1888,2.1635,4.8647,3.1293,0.5594,2.3324,2.1826,0.0179,0.7923,0.4817,5.0513,6.1185,1.2155,4.5918,0.9174,2.2011,0.8156,1.0276,4.2634,1.9669,1.8793,5.1132,3.1039,2.5896,2.496,1.6384,4.1604,2.0898,2.8569,2.2988,2.6028,3.5851,4.0855,4.1118,5.0099,0.3388,1.4763,4.6649,1.4043,3.3698,1.5179,3.8883,2.7277,0.433,1.2952,0.0002,4.8118,0.7507,2.5668,2.1477,0.0614,2.3742,1.834,1.4061,0.7787,4.1645,3.8208,1.6614,2.7731,2.1704,4.6119,2.6545,3.3686,3.5771,1.2098,3.4509,5.4415,0.9673,2.4349,3.4903,0.0093,0.3401,0.6519,2.8991,0.088,0.7009,4.3676,1.8334,2.3627,1.0114,5.4736,0.0357,0.002,0.1897,1.1373,0.7773,0.7068,5.6541,4.7117,0.9936,4.6411,0.4636,4.5431,0.9184,2.8406,0.155,3.8052,1.9639,0.189,1.592,3.59,3.207,4.4457,2.2555,1.3057,3.4009,1.5273,2.3666,4.1296,5.1235,0.7873,5.4577,1.7746,4.1749,6.2964,0.4537,2.9534,0.0078,0.9487,0.1941,0.0002,4.0875,2.9506,5.2041,2.0776,1.3007,1.3096,1.9087,2.996,3.8569,2.9918,0.1065,2.1435,3.4774,2.742,1.0112,3.93,1.6982,3.4896,0.8848,0.9054,3.1165,4.0756,1.4511,2.0311,2.7247,2.8924,2.5348,4.5191,5.1329,0.7933,2.2085,3.094,4.4944,0.4878,0.3574,0.3891,0.1737,2.4222,0.0001,6.1044,1.157,0.5575,3.5846,5.7723,0.1379,0.9912,4.2667,0.1186,1.1371,3.4001,1.2452,2.7674,1.7541,4.0196,4.4343,1.7896,5.087,3.4589,1.6817,0.8095,0.4653,4.17,0.9459,5.0241,0.0988,1.7933,1.9336,5.0719,2.085,0.1983,5.0181,0.7783,4.6353,0.8166,1.6092,4.3116,2.0454,1.0632,0.0002,5.1728,6.3753,0.1769,0.0202,2.905,0.1503,1.5061,4.5977,0.0111,0.5637,2.0406,2.5804,2.2062,0.1524,5.6056,1.234,6.0608,0.0013,0.0003,1.7498,2.2533,3.4746,3.5303,0.5072,4.6277,0.2603,1.992,5.3467,6.1396,4.0133,5.933,1.5237,4.1667,0.0345,0.4727,4.8864,0.7029,3.9809,0.0348,5.4538,1.1599,0.0299,1.4796,0.584,2.088,0.382,1.1737,1.7757,0.0094,0.0001,4.1282,2.7602,2.5758,4.3825,3.1715,4.4391,0.8724,1.3083,5.8585,5.5323,4.6072,1.28,3.6834,2.5444,4.5472,0.0217,0.8843,4.7385,0.0109,1.7317,4.4211,0.976,0.5298,0.0002,5.541,0.2608,0.0818,0.0004,0.0011,0.0018,0.0007,0.003,0.0002,0.001,0.0015,0.0107,0.0014,0.0001,0.0008,0.0013,0.0013,0.0138,0.001,0.0009,0.0006,0.0027,0.1076,0.0019,0.0201,0.0023,0.0033,0.0014,0.0005,0.001,0.0002,0.0006,0.0054,0.0005,0.0027,0.0016,0.0028,0.0023,0.0009,0.008,0.0006,0.0011,0.0103,0.0012,0.0001,0.0003,0.0016,0.0005,0.0071,0.004,0.0019,0.0017,0.0013,0.019,0.0013,0.0015,0.0211,0.0015,0.005,0.0005,0.0052,0.0014,0.0146,0.0009,0.0003,0.0034,0.0005,6.3808,2.2005,3.0353,3.4444,1.5915,4.1603,0.0046,0.5428,3.3799,2.5764,0.022,5.7063,3.5485,2.1847,2.6357,2.6594,4.685,1.3165,0.5917,2.4671,1.5937,4.2258,4.0763,0.3679,1.6267,4.1636,3.7753,2.7211,3.4029,1.0575,3.8749,6.4536,1.6052,5.743,4.0181,0.7938,1.2159,0.0002,6.2765,0.8541,0.0024,0.0002,0.0005,0.0016,0.0032,0.2312,0.0011,0.0086,0.0026,0.0031,0.0047,0.0014,0.0124,0.001,0.0018,0.0009,0.004,0.001,0.0204,0.0059,0.0606,0.0057,0.0003,0.0012,0.0027,0.0025,0.0579,0.0017,0.0012,0.0499,0.0022,0.0005,4.0655,0.7998,3.421,1.0445,2.3102,1.7211,4.1725,1.2727,0.0033,0.0653,0.6357,2.0299,2.6821,1.7869,1.0715,5.5831,0.9398,1.6801,1.9773,0.3188,0.2126,0.8885,0.8861,0.0002,2.0567,5.7261,4.5363,0.0757,5.7704,3.081,4.1916,1.2806,5.7995,2.3841,0.0258,0.2127,0.0877,4.0735,4.3894,3.2411,0.015,0.9761,6.2134,0.0047,3.2169,2.1178,2.9725,4.498,1.2315,2.1292,2.1087,3.7319,4.1903,4.1153,4.7121,2.1828,1.5694,3.7137,0.0863,1.1749,1.8433,1.304,1.4411,0.8055,5.0795,4.7582,4

{"id":352,"ended":false,"length":734,"gen_text":"A sequence of events during the past weeks turned you from a simple person to a murderous savage. Tell us your story but make us sympathize with you and understand our own struggles in the way that those of us who can bear to lose our own people have with them. Remember that the only thing we want you to do to survive is to save your country, America. Don't die while we're on this roller coaster of emotions. Our first and only task is to see this moment pass and that moment pass and this moment pass. Because if we can't save this country for itself, that's just it. So what has happened with America? To the extent that we know that there were a lot of hard times over our long time relationship with China, we don't know what to do. We didn't know that Japan was ready to destroy America and China really was preparing to do it. Our country can't change its destiny from what it got out of what China bought it, so there's no change here. We've watched Chinese leaders try to cut their nation from world order by getting their hands dirty with our leaders. We've seen them get their hands dirty with some of the biggest names in the entertainment business. But from your perspective you can see that we've been completely ignored by those who have power, by those who will see this great change only now. We've been ignored by those who are supposed to make the world what it is. That's what we're seeing the same reaction over and over again. They're calling us as foreigners, and we're calling ourselves Americans, but this one's different. That's our responsibility. It's our responsibility to make America stronger, and if we don't do that, you're going to live in this nightmare. Let's start by getting a little more honest with the folks here in your home state of Washington. It is my conviction that the best way to save this country is to save for American values. I'm going to make it so that every American should have the chance to decide what it means to be their best selves for life. Whether it's fighting for your country, fighting for your future, fighting for your culture, the way you choose to live your life. This isn't what you put your hand on, this is what you put your life on. When you spend your time listening to your heart, listening to your brain, just being on the same wavelength, that kind of thing is what we all need to take away from this event. So please listen to, listen to. I would say to those people standing in the cold, that's why you are seeing our country as living on the edge, and we are living on the edge again. If you believe me when I tell my story, all of these people that live in the South have the knowledge that your country is doomed. Our country has to look for change for everyone within the country to make their own choice. I think that's what you and I are seeing now in our situation. You see the fear, the fear of change, but we're in a new era. It's time for the change that's going to be found in American politics and our government. We need to not allow that. Let's get it right and save for America.\n\n\"Your goal in life is not your enemy. It's to make your true self better, better, happier. When you lose, I say I am sorry as always.

{"id":3823,"ended":true,"length":705,"gen_text":"Around 2100 all humans on Earth and nearby space mysteriously go extinct, leaving only a few hundred people across bases on Mars. Most of them only have supplies for a few months.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean that those people on Mars need to be replaced today because of the planet's weather and climate. On Earth we are exposed to the Earth's harsh weather, which could negatively affect humans on Mars.\n\n\"With climate change, [human] populations [could] be put at risk,\" says Dr. B. C. Johnson, a climate science and engineering professor at Texas A&M University, who has been researching climate change since 1987.\n\nThe most deadly potential effects have been humans on Mars for years now since 2007. In particular, there's been considerable atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions from Mars by the end of the century, which can negatively impact the planet's average temperatures.\n\n\"There is a large amount of change in atmospheric carbon dioxide that impacts the Mars ecosystem. In fact, there appears to be a very big change in the levels of carbon dioxide in Mars. It takes a very long period of time for humans in any given area to have a significant impact,\" says Browning.\n\nIn fact, the impacts of climate change have never been recorded for a living planet where the planet is relatively cold and has little atmosphere to sustain life on the red planet. In comparison, the impact of climate change on Mars has been recorded for 3 million years. That means that we would lose the same amount of climate in 2050 because of climate change.\n\nThere hasn't been a case of human-made CO 2 emissions impacting Mars and humans on Earth since the very beginning of mankind's human occupation 15 million years ago. In fact, on Mars scientists are currently analyzing this \"missing link\" at the beginning of the Martian Ice Age.\n\nEven before Mars ice age, carbon dioxide is increasing in the atmosphere. The amount of CO 2 released by the atmosphere varies widely by planet over history, giving it little time to break through the ice caps with its own gravity, which might otherwise prevent any future climate change.\n\nIn any case, Mars appears not to have had an ice age before the planet reached about 30,000 years ago. This time around CO 2 levels are about as high as they possibly can get in our galaxy, said Browning. That means the Martian record is far from perfect.\n\n\"The Mars climate we are using today is very different from what we have over the past 20,000 years,\" he told Space, \"and so we would expect a high level of CO 2 buildup that's similar to what we see if we were living on Mars after 20,000 years ago.\"\n\nBrowning added that the only time a temperature change over 100 fF can be measured is during the last Ice Age. That means that CO 2 emissions are likely to be higher than they were during that period.\n\nAs with the present, the Mars ice age could be a record for CO 2 production. The ice cover of Mars is one of the most important geological features that exist around Mars. The ice layer was more massive than most of Earth (including today's Mars, and possibly the planet's most important part ), but would have also been thicker and thicker on the surface.\n\n\"With the

{"id":4179,"ended":true,"length":705,"gen_text":"Around 2100 all humans on Earth and nearby space mysteriously go extinct, leaving only a few hundred people across bases on Mars. Most of them only have supplies for a few months.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean that those people on Mars need to be replaced today because of the planet's weather and climate. On Earth we are exposed to the Earth's harsh weather, which could negatively affect humans on Mars.\n\n\"With climate change, [human] populations [could] be put at risk,\" says Dr. B. C. Johnson, a climate science and engineering professor at Texas A&M University, who has been researching climate change since 1987.\n\nThe most deadly potential effects have been humans on Mars for years now since 2007. In particular, there's been considerable atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions from Mars by the end of the century, which can negatively impact the planet's average temperatures.\n\n\"There is a large amount of change in atmospheric carbon dioxide that impacts the Mars ecosystem. In fact, there appears to be a very big change in the levels of carbon dioxide in Mars. It takes a very long period of time for humans in any given area to have a significant impact,\" says Browning.\n\nIn fact, the impacts of climate change have never been recorded for a living planet where the planet is relatively cold and has little atmosphere to sustain life on the red planet. In comparison, the impact of climate change on Mars has been recorded for 3 million years. That means that we would lose the same amount of climate in 2050 because of climate change.\n\nThere hasn't been a case of human-made CO 2 emissions impacting Mars and humans on Earth since the very beginning of mankind's human occupation 15 million years ago. In fact, on Mars scientists are currently analyzing this \"missing link\" at the beginning of the Martian Ice Age.\n\nEven before Mars ice age, carbon dioxide is increasing in the atmosphere. The amount of CO 2 released by the atmosphere varies widely by planet over history, giving it little time to break through the ice caps with its own gravity, which might otherwise prevent any future climate change.\n\nIn any case, Mars appears not to have had an ice age before the planet reached about 30,000 years ago. This time around CO 2 levels are about as high as they possibly can get in our galaxy, said Browning. That means the Martian record is far from perfect.\n\n\"The Mars climate we are using today is very different from what we have over the past 20,000 years,\" he told Space, \"and so we would expect a high level of CO 2 buildup that's similar to what we see if we were living on Mars after 20,000 years ago.\"\n\nBrowning added that the only time a temperature change over 100 fF can be measured is during the last Ice Age. That means that CO 2 emissions are likely to be higher than they were during that period.\n\nAs with the present, the Mars ice age could be a record for CO 2 production. The ice cover of Mars is one of the most important geological features that exist around Mars. The ice layer was more massive than most of Earth (including today's Mars, and possibly the planet's most important part ), but would have also been thicker and thicker on the surface.\n\n\"With the CO 2 concentrations in the Martian atmosphere, the Martian ice cap is probably over a much wider area than the Earth.\"\n\nScientists speculate that the Martian carbon dioxide record on Earth might also be the most volatile record on the planet, which could significantly alter its climate record, depending upon what form of vegetation humans consume on

{"id":2988,"ended":false,"length":678,"gen_text":"Every person reacts to one random object, which causes him\/her to have extreme hallucinations, not unlike taking drugs. You discover yours in the worst possible situation.\n\nHowever, that is exactly what makes those people so terrifying. Even if you can't remember the exact point of their behavior, there is still the possibility for them to be really, really bad at everything, but there is nothing that tells you anything about them.\n\nHow do we learn to fear these people?\n\nThese people are terrifying, and because of their abilities that can give you clues about the world around them, you have to learn to fear them (and your own hallucinations).\n\nSo how do we learn to fear these people?\n\nHow would you learn the exact things that cause you to feel so much fear?\n\nMany things that can change your life (especially your life style).\n\nHere are a few ideas that really help us to overcome and prevent fear:\n\n1) We never fear someone. We have the experience.\n\n2) We never judge someone because of their looks.\n\n3) We don't let ourselves think or feel that we should have a hard time with anyone based solely on their appearance.\n\n4) We never think of being the worst person because we don't even like people who look so different.\n\n5) We never think of being \" 'bad'because we don't really care about the \"good' things\" that the other people (the people we do care about most ) are doing to ourselves or others that are even worse than us like we will only become bad once they go under the radar.\n\nLet's take a look at the above examples:\n\nThe worst person is somebody who doesn't care about anything. One who can't even talk very long enough to talk about anything at all.\n\nThe most terrifying person is someone who will never talk about anything at all. People who will never talk about anything during their time apart from playing sports, playing with kids, having sex, having their dreams blown out of proportion.\n\nIn any society, these people will never admit to themselves that they are something horrible even if it is very important (because that's how we'll eventually become even more evil people). For instance, one can be incredibly powerful for being in one place and very powerless in another environment and living in absolute isolation, yet one's fear is such an important part of living life that one will die from it all.\n\nThese are, literally speaking, the same thing :\n\nThe worst person knows that they are so horrible.\n\nThe most terrifying person knows that they are so horrible that they care about nothing at all.\n\nThe most terrifying person cares only for their own good.\n\nThe worst person isn't much of a person.\n\nThe most frightening person doesn't care about anyone.\n\nThe worst person does nothing for any other reason than to benefit from being a person in a situation where the real evil people are already out there. These are just some of the ways that this will occur in our societies. We learn to control our own fear as often as we can.\n\nTo try making it easier to fear these people simply read on and click on the links below, to your right:\n\nThe Best People for Fearing

Who knows who you are, but for some reason we just don't recognise you.'\n\n\"The older children looked at me like I was something else from the old school playground.\n\n\"I said to 'you just look like the older children and they'll always recognise you because they know you're a good guy,' and they were.\n\n\"I had to apologise for that because even now, it feels wrong.\n\n\"I'm glad that the children are happy with the way they went about their lives.\n\n\"They're so proud of who they are but they know there's a better way.\n\n\"I've always loved children but what could my kids do, where they might be playing today?\"\n\n'If those children want to play I'm going to make it work'\n\nHer little girl was happy when she was given a chance, but when asked why she chose to stay away, she had no choice but to admit she wanted to stay.\n\nLisa said: \"I didn't want to do anything. It wasn't even my choice, but it was the one thing we were all excited about.\"\n\nShe added: \"I just wanted to make sure it wasn't something we had to pay for to go to therapy or to go through some stuff.\n\n\"We took care of them as they were. We stayed in homes where they were safe.\n\n\"But we'd run back to see them and ask if they knew of any girls to take our picture.\"\n\nAfter the story got a lot of attention, the Save Christmas Society took it upon themselves to document where they were on the spectrum.\n\n\"For the most part, most of the girls did not go away because they're not safe,\" says McAlister.\n\n\"It's the main one \u2013 we need to have a more diverse range of girls for help with this.\"\n\nShe found it harder to accept they were at all as the girls were coming from a different heritage group.\n\n\"It was like 'who are you?' for a while \u2013 no one could really understand.\n\n\"But for a long time it felt like a good place to be.

{"id":503,"ended":false,"length":727,"gen_text":"Take the last sentence from the last thing you wrote. That's the beginning of this story.\n\n\"It was in the year 2000 that the first atomic bomb dropped by Hiroshima exploded -- in the United States. And I feel sorry for those people who didn't get in the way of a nuclear family.\"\n\nHe took another question from the audience. Who had been talking about Fukushima and Fukushima Daiichi before he made the announcement on the floor, and where he got the idea?\n\n\"Well, it was actually some day back,\" said Chino. \"For people who were out of work, I think they knew they had to move to New York, with a nice hotel, or they were going to live in Japan. So what was the point?\"\n\n\"Well, they probably didn't want any more radiation because they thought it was such a bad idea, and they weren't going to go out, so there's no point here.\"\n\nNow who did have to leave his job at GE if nuclear accidents happen here, or not in any way at all?\n\n\"Well, some of my own colleagues who are doctors have been in charge of Fukushima. And they didn't know where the Fukushima reactor came from. When I went, it was so cold, with only a warm blanket, and I thought I could be here. So the question was, what had I done that I would lose the business of life?\"\n\nHe added, \"No reason to expect anyone here -- that's just an idea. But I will say, if he died, I'm very comfortable with that because he died by a combination of incompetence, negligence, greed, and incompetence. So this is a very serious problem. One that we need to have very focused on in order to prevent something that occurred in the first place. No one's going to be safe at Fukushima; there's no safety blanket over Fukushima; you're out in the middle of nowhere, and you can't do anything, and you start worrying about the next bomb exploding in the city.\"\n\nThe last thing Shoshone said during his speech was, \"There's going to be a lot more noise.\"\n\nThis was a fascinating conversation, and one that was filled with great conversation. He had one of the most unique moments in his career, his wife being on the floor talking to him about their daughter and what they both felt about Fukushima. We've all been there and listened to, and this is one of the best anecdotes of this election season. Many of the major events are happening now and they will always be happening, and we are going to have to remember it. One of the things that got my mind rolling all of these years ago when I started doing that is that we had seen the meltdown of nuclear power plants in many different parts of the United States. We had seen how the nuclear industry was being hijacked by a special interest group in Washington and they wanted to take the country by storm, to sabotage our economy, and that was their plan. And as you say, I saw how many of the people that put up the barricades wanted us to end up here. And one of the things that was striking on that last night was that nobody was listening to what they were saying -- not a single person who had a voice -- and when I asked the people in the audience how many people wanted them to see the bomb on their bodies, they said there were only 50 people.

{"id":1495,"ended":true,"length":706,"gen_text":"A curse was placed on you in which your life shortens based on the amount of time people spend thinking about you. You make it your goal to be the most uninteresting person in the world. You never play with that idea of others doing stuff or acting like it.\n\nThe fact is if you make it your dream job to be the most entertaining, the most interesting person in the world, everything you do ends up with those two results.\n\nThat's part of it. If you make it your dream job to be the most entertaining, the most interesting person in the world, things start to happen for your body, you stop worrying about your skin so much, your soul gets better and you get tired of talking about nothing for fear of being noticed. If you make it your dream job to be the most amused, the most ridiculous person in the world, things change for the better and you stop trying to talk about it because that's a waste of time your parents, your friends, your boss will always think, \"That's so pathetic\", and your parents will always have a crush on you.\n\nThat's part of it, that you're supposed to be entertaining. A joke. You should have a joke, not one based solely on your background.\n\nThe most ridiculous person in the world is always the one who is funny, who gets laughed at (takes it from us) then when you do that \"you are supposed to make the funniest jokes possible\", they'll laugh at you. That's why they will laugh at you instead.\n\nIn that situation, nothing you do will make it into this world for them, it won't make you rich, it won't make you beautiful, it won't make you feel nice, you're so lazy. It will make you miserable, miserable.\n\nThere's no real point in being funny, I don't want to be funny, just enjoy myself.\n\nIf I make myself funny, then I am a happy person!\n\nDon't get me wrong, if it sounds like people enjoy yourself, then you should start enjoying yourself first.\n\nJust have fun with yourself, it's your body. It's your brain, the things you do and the things that you make with it. It's your memory, you're not going to forget anything you've made.\n\nIt's all about your brain now. So remember that.\n\nIf you don't enjoy yourself, you can only really enjoy yourself afterwards.\n\nWhen I'm doing crazy things with my body, I usually keep it to a high level because I'm not that guy anymore so then I don't really enjoy myself that much.\n\nBut I do, you do. So remember that.\n\nYou are my body, all of these things that happen to you make your life easier.\n\nIf you don't enjoy yourself, you can always try playing around with it to a higher level.\n\nI think that's a good thing to do, no really.\n\nFor you, when you're done, then just tell yourself that it's cool. It's your time to leave, then start doing it again.\n\nA lot of us will always try not making it into the next world, and no longer get to think that it's cool.\n\nIt's your time to be here, don't

{"id":4060,"ended":false,"length":668,"gen_text":"I'm heading the wrong way... but I'm not that guy,\" said Jackson.\n\nJackson, who scored 16 points in Friday's 102-87 win over the Golden State Warriors, is looking to get in the starting line-up of the Golden State Warriors with Golden State's Andrew Bogut, Harrison Barnes and Paul George and is expected to see his scoring average rise.\n\n\"When I watch games, that's it. I'm getting the reps,\" Jackson said. \"So you always try to step in more. You look at their guys, see how they're looking, see who they're with, and the way they play, you want your guys to come in and provide the things that can change a game. You come into games with this little piece that needs to be utilized, and your guys don't. And I can be one of those guys there that's getting those big buckets off, who needs to step in and provide the ball.\"\n\nBogut, who scored 20 points in the Warriors' 108-105 loss to Minnesota on April 3, is also averaging 17.2 points per game. He's averaging 24.7 percent shooting through the first 10 games of the season. The Warriors are 4-9 on 3-pointers this season.\n\nIn Game 4, Golden State fell to 8-10 on 3-pointers and had a 30-34 hold. They could have scored as many as 26 or 27 if they had played without Bogut and George at least a little more. It was also a first game after the Suns went 7-9 during the first three quarters.\n\nPistons guard Joe Ingles is expected to take the spot of Bogut in a starter rotation. But coach Steve Kerr is expected to go with Jackson, George and Bogut to lead the starting shooting rotation.\n\n\"It was going to be just a matter of getting those guys with the ball, going over there, taking good shots, going over there, shooting,\" Kerr said, per ESPN.com. \"There's going to be some of those guys around the league. We did some things with that.\"\n\nThe Warriors, who lost their previous four games to Golden State and had one win in the final seven at AT&T Park, have averaged 13.2 points and 6.0 rebounds. The Jazz have gone 24 of 36 from the floor in the last 10, and are 11-38 in their last 16 this season.\n\nGolden State scored 29.0 points per game in that stretch after winning 108-86 at home on May 9 and 107-81 at home on Oct. 5. But turnovers against Minnesota and Portland (10-26) was enough to keep the lead at 13:13 in the third quarter for the most by a Warriors team since they won 107-104 at Sacramento on Aug. 9, 2009.\n\nIt's the seventh win by a Warriors team since 1991, when Utah (10-27) won 118-102 at Detroit and 124-109 (13-18) in the final two games of the 1992-93 campaign. It also was the fourth straight loss for the Rockets to go 20-13 in a season.\n\n\"We're making some tough decisions because we played good basketball in the first six games,\" Jackson said. \"We are very disappointed in how we played last night. (The Jazz) obviously lost, it kind of shows you what you can do. (The Warriors) can't do that again.

{"id":4723,"ended":true,"length":709,"gen_text":"You wake one morning to find you have developed the ability to eliminate any amount of suffering in the world... by transfering it to yourself. You can never die, but every bit of sadness, and pain exerts itself on you as if it was your own. Today you decide to take on all the worlds suffering. You are going to find it all difficult to live anymore... You need to find a way around it. In this way you can feel truly relieved.\n\n- A lot in the book, a lot of the other people have died, but you really did help them, and all they said and did was to see them go away, and that's how it came about. Then you got to find others to talk to your head. And you see it through with so much calmness, you're a very patient person.\n\n- Some things aren't pleasant. If you get tired the way you were, you have to go back to the world to see more and more people you cared for and cared for more, where the misery is even worse. There are really no good places to go to live.\n\n- It's never easier to work here and now,. Just have a good relationship with the other world.\n\n- It turns out there is a lot of suffering on the outside. You can have a good life with one person, but it's quite hard to have a healthy life with another person.\n\n- What you did right has helped you deal with all the sad things now.\n\n- You did what you were supposed to do, don't you think? That's what I think today is.\n\n- At least most people have that kind of feeling in their past. The way we handle sadness and suffering in everyday life today is very different. It has very different meaning if we talk about it as a part of ourselves, and you're still looking for somebody who's going through that at the beginning. It's all in the present.\n\n- I didn't think I was going to say anything.\n\n- I just felt that part of myself - just the part I was. The pain in myself is just one big part of the whole process, and this is just what has really helped me deal with it. I want to share how that felt when I first saw her when I was about 11 years old. Her voice was so deep. It was so strong, you could feel it in her heart. It made you smile and laugh all the same. Her smile had a meaning to all of us, and now we are all looking for someone who really can live together over this huge tragedy. I knew that her voice was right. Now she's the one who loves people and wants to be loved. I want you to take her back to your roots and ask yourself - If she can live on without us? If she makes me happy that it's over, then let's go back to the beginning.\n\n...\n\n- I know it's been a while,\n\n,\n\n- I do not ask how the world was before that, and no, I don't ask what our situation really is now.

{"id":3053,"ended":true,"length":682,"gen_text":"Without saying the word love, you write the most passionate love letter you can imagine.\n\nJust one more example of true love :\n\nDear My Father\n\nDear My Mother\n\nI cannot have any more love than you to you, Mary. Love is what makes a love come true. It is pure and eternal. You and I are of the same time and our love is so simple.\n\nLet me know what you have to say so I can answer it for you.\n\nDon't forget that being a love person always means being a person who can share the joy and laughter of others. As for my parents, who were both children of such a loving couple: If you want your love to come true, you have more chance of being a loving parent in your life than some loving parents. Therefore, love can come true in your parents, who are the most loving people. Love, as well as love as a human being, is a kind of divine relationship that goes outside of the body and inside the soul. If I was loving you and I were married, I should have a lot of love from you. But I am married, but you were not. So, yes, love is one of the most precious things in the Eternal Father's Will.\n\nI hope your love is true.\n\nIn Your Loving Letters\n\nIn your daily writing, every single letter you write always has a loving message. When you write that love as you find it, you begin to look at the source of your love, and your heart is raised to the very high point you are in, then you can begin to see what lies beyond that and how much more this is possible with your love. One of the most powerful gifts of a writer is that he can have a life without the words he uses every single time. At times you write that love for someone because you will not remember what you said out loud. There is one day when you can actually remember it, and it will be for the next.\n\nIn your writing, if you want your writing to be more passionate, then the more you write, the greater your potential will be for what you write about. There you can start to explore the heart and mind of someone you truly love. There is absolutely no need for another person to think about being on the same wavelength with you because you can now really see both side of you. No matter what happens with her writing, it's always something new. You can see people who are much more compassionate than anything they have. You can start to see that love is really a matter of life, to care for and heal.\n\nI hope your love is true.\n\nReferences\n\nPierno, D., & Coates, J.-B. \"The Love Life of A Writer,\" Archives of Family Issues, Volume 33, Issue 7 (2008), pp. 9-27.\n\nMills, D.

{"id":1397,"ended":true,"length":634,"gen_text":"On patrol in the English channel U.S.S Nimitz aircraft carrier is caught up in a storm. The clouds clear and they emerge in the midst of a 16th century naval battle.\n\nNimitz in the Atlantic Ocean\n\n\nIt's the fourth year that Nimitz has been under attack by the powerful U.S. Navy.\n\nNimitz is one of America's most photographed nuclear fissile agents\n\nHe was once called 'Father of Fissile Forces' before he was dubbed 'Father of Fissile Forces'.\n\nThe destroyer USS Forrestal is the biggest new U.S. naval destroyer ever built.\n\nIn the past few years US sailors have been attacked on various bases and targets since the 1960s with a range of projectiles from projectiles to missile launchers.\n\nWhen asked what he sees more dangerous than ships in the sea with huge nuclear warheads?\n\nNimitz, pictured alongside his namesake Nimitz, is seen in the air during a training exercise with his Navy mates at Sea Lion King\n\nNimitz made some of the most famous nuclear strike in history during his time with the fleet of submarines and the battleship USS Nimitz in 1945.\n\n\nIn 2015, the Nimitz destroyer USS Forrestal was hit by a rocket launched from North Korean nuclear site near the Korean border, which killed two US sailors.\n\nTwo crew members were injured, while one died, after the rocket exploded, and both had to be rescued from a nearby hospital for treatment.\n\nWhile most people see that incident as a 'troubling', it was an event that killed two sailors, three Marines and four US Marines.\n\nNimitz, pictured above with his father during a tour of New Jersey after their ship was sunk by missiles in 1945 at U.S. destroyer USS Forrestal in New Jersey\n\nIt didn't take long before the two men were transported to a hospital, but Nimitz's life was saved by the courage of the two US Marines who boarded the Nimitz, and he was saved from the missile's explosion by the heroic rescue crew.\n\nIn the last ten years it was captured on video at Naval Air Station Tampa, Florida where it is being used by the US Navy to target North Korean submarines and weapons stations.\n\n'As my father put it, 'the war is ending and the people are going to be killed'.\n\n'We now have 20 years to rebuild us and to live our lives more than ever before. As a community we've come, and as American citizens we must continue to live this life to the fullest.'\n\nAs part of his mission to protect this nation after the U.S.-led war he joined forces with the Navy's largest ship to hit numerous targets all over the globe.\n\nHe also served on two combat duty teams on the Navy's Navy Seals (Naval Seals) Team that tracked a missile that the North used to launch a missile into the U.S. Navy's warship in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nNimitz joined the Navy for seven years in 1962 with his command of the ship, but they became two of the most experienced

{"id":2859,"ended":true,"length":717,"gen_text":"A man who has had no knowledge of religion meets both God and the Devil. He is the chosen one who decides whether God or the Devil inherits the Earth. The problem is, he can not tell which is which.\n\nGod has no idea what is going on in the world. The Devil knows what is going on and is trying to keep the matter under control.\n\nThe Earth's atmosphere is not a perfect environment and the Devil is manipulating those around him to make him do whatever he wants. As soon as the Devil destroys all life in the atmosphere the earth falls apart where he is able to take it all, leaving the earth untouched.\n\nGod is trying to control the Devil by causing more earth to break down and he is using the Earth for his own purposes.\n\nHe is trying to control what happens to any one of you by placing you in a large vessel inside of the Devil, his vessel, which makes it easier for him to control its influence and use it to his advantage.\n\nGod can be seen on Earth as there is no physical force inside the Earth.\n\nGod cannot control his nature, he only possesses His essence which is His essence in this world.\n\nIf there is not enough power inside the Earth to allow him to control his nature, there is never enough energy to destroy the planet completely.\n\nIf there is enough power, then the Devil can control the people around him, but is controlled by his ability to control every aspect of human life and human civilization, especially those who are connected to Him. It makes perfect sense because, even if the Devil doesn't understand or know that the Earth is full of life and will only attack if he is able to escape out of it if necessary, then then only the devil would understand He can control human nature in a way that is logical and even at the beginning a little suspicious of Satan.\n\nEven if I am a bit paranoid with the Devil then God doesn't always want to be seen as evil by me.\n\nSo God says \" don't be afraid, it is just that Satan never knows what it wants.\"\n\nIf you know what is going on in the Earth then God will destroy any people who are around Him because if something happens to them then they turn away and Satan will do what he wants.\n\nGod doesn't know what is going on in the world. If He had only knew the things that are going on and if they are being monitored the world wouldn't be such a bad place to live.\n\nGod can be manipulated by taking power from the Earth, but he is not the one controlling it. Satan can only be used as a pawn by Satan. If one knows what is going on, and if they can manipulate the world then it will be able to take control over the entire earth for Satan's own ends.\n\nWhen the powers of the devil are on your mind then it doesn't look like you can use Satan's powers to take over the world for your own ends no matter what you do. It looks like Satan's intentions in the end simply won't work like a natural.\n\nGod is using human technology as an excuse to take over the earth for his own ends.\n\nA person with no education is less likely to understand God's power of power and ability to control the Earth to the extent that they are able to control it to their own ends, when they enter into such a situation they will be

{"id":1840,"ended":true,"length":685,"gen_text":"Neighborhood Watch\n\nIn October, in the wake of the devastating natural disasters that swept through most of eastern Montana, National Geographic photographer and wildlife photographer Mark Fierman revealed that the majority of the mountain ranges he saw in Glacier National Park have mysteriously disappeared.\n\nFierman had been researching his area and found the area to have been completely drained and abandoned by the time he visited in 2009:\n\nWhen I came here four years ago, the mountains we found were virtually empty; all that had survived and were still intact; we never knew they had turned into barren deserts, but with time\u2014it seemed\u2014it seemed like they were now more than 40 years old, more complete with trees and rock, with a lot more life with little less vegetation. Everything was gone, but the mountains, it seemed, were not. They left, and there was nothing left but snow, and nothing but a patchwork of empty houses, all of them in good condition, with no vegetation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFierman spent some time digging a few miles up, but quickly discovered that there was just very little left. On top of the dead vegetation, there was a dead, worn-out concrete block with only a few small trees.\n\nAfter looking through the debris, the two climbers decided to try trying something different: They decided to dig a few more miles up into a field that had been left behind. They decided that it was now the best place for them to leave and take photos of their newly discovered world, using a GoPro device mounted on their left wrist. He described what he and their friends had been able to find:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce all their supplies are all in place I am confident that my photographs will capture something quite different than we were expecting. The terrain looks so much different\u2026 there is a lot of tree cover, just a lot of little mountains and ridges. I was really pleased with the quality of the photos. I think the mountains look like their own accord. We had to take a lot of photos with cameras because they were so small. This isn't what you see in the real world, but it was absolutely amazing: there were just so many places where mountains could be so much better\u2026 and there are just a lot of ways we could zoom over them to better see them\u2026 it was amazing. We couldn't be more surprised with how it turned out. I would say that it was incredible to actually photograph that many things at once.\n\nFierman's pictures are quite impressive so far, with some striking vistas showing the landscapes he's been capturing over the years. He's also spotted a handful of big tree-dwelling bison nesting at Yellowstone National Park, which he hopes will give wildlife biologists more insight into how they manage to keep up with the world's population\u2014which is currently about 10 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere's also a curious species of tree in Canada called the bichard, which I saw in a number of different places in the last few months:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI also noticed that some of the trees in the park had recently been taken over by tree-hugging (some have been removed from their natural habitat because of a lack of vegetation), especially in the eastern part of the park:\n\nThe bichard is also looking to make further progress on the trail, which is to be expanded to another park. Although it's still a bit of a long way off, this is the hope that the park is able to reach before its official entrance is due in late January or early February.\n\nYou can also continue to share

{"id":3437,"ended":true,"length":689,"gen_text":"A Shortage of Avocados Sparks a Crime Spree\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Scott Strazzante\/AP Scott Strazzante\/AP\n\nSome restaurants are already working on an \"Espresso-like experience\" where customers sit quietly as they sip coffee using an app that lets food taste and be eaten without having to explain how and when the espresso works.\n\nA group called Black Box Coffee has put out a video called \"Coffee in the Middle of the Night\" \u2014 it's called the Best Time Ever for Starbucks to Launch Coffee and Coffee-Related Apps. The video has since gained over 1.9 million views on YouTube.\n\nIt's not unusual for coffee makers to offer more than one version of the same coffee, which makes it easier for consumers to choose between a variety of flavors \u2014 from a bright and subtle coffee to a crisp and dry, spicy Italian.\n\nBut the Black Box concept has been so successful that the company decided it wouldn't make any changes to its app.\n\nBut when a customer asked for one on Twitter, the app began to run slow. One customer asked Black Box to suspend its service, so the app didn't work properly and the customer was warned back: \"Shut down the app until we can send you a cup.\"\n\nBlack Box was not happy and offered to provide the service back on Monday but that's OK. At that point, a woman complained as they watched the app get shut down. The app would continue to run at least 24 hours later, but the company said it would be suspending its service as soon as customers complained of a slow service and decided to try this \"Espresso-like experience\" out.\n\nBlack Box hasn't confirmed what kind of service Black Box is planning to offer but its customer service representatives told NPR that the coffee company is not a customer service company. In other words, Black Box doesn't know what it's doing, so they might just start taking coffee shots at others.\n\ntoggle caption Scott Strazzante\/AP\n\nThere's also something creepy about Black Box's idea that its users make mistakes when doing coffee. Starbucks has a list of potential users and if you search for a term like \"black box,\" you can get a link to a post that has a Starbucks barista talking about using the service to send a cup of coffee over the Internet.\n\nAnd if you're feeling weird about this, you can even use it for free to make your own online shopping videos.\n\n\"You could literally take that [black box] thing from Starbucks to any other Starbucks \u2014 and it's like a very safe online store all by itself, right?\" said Sam Levine, a professor of marketing at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Levine is one of the co-founder team behind the site Etsy, a digital marketplace founded by entrepreneurs and established entrepreneurs.\n\n\"What we need to do now, I think, is take responsibility for ourselves as entrepreneurs and to take responsibility for ourselves as a consumer. We can't just accept somebody who's not really here,\" Levine explained.\n\nBlack Box has started testing the service to see whether it's working, Levine said. The company says its customer base is mostly comprised of millennials, millennials in high school, people who are looking for a way to spend the year on their first weekend of college (which is also

{"id":1125,"ended":false,"length":729,"gen_text":"5 really short stories, 5 really short minutes. (and 2 really short short stories for the same story) But these short stories seem to be more interesting if you make up for it with short narration.\n\n, short descriptions. I'm not a fan of the way people talk about those stories, so I was curious to see what other people had to say about those.\n\n, so I was curious to see what other people had to say about those. There are stories about some super heroes we're talking about now (there's more than one). There's also a character on TV named \" Arundin \" with a nice voice, and a pretty good story about a guy who's kind of evil. One example of another super hero with a really good story.\n\nor. In recent years, I've been taking part in books where I've had to deal with some writing assignments. And some of us are working on short stories.\n\nI have read a lot of shorter stories, and I know a lot of them get cut. I'd love to read a few more if I can. But sometimes when I have very short stories, I just want to read one. And some writers like to cut back so long that they only start short stories when they do a short story.\n\nBut the short stories are just so popular that those stories get short-story commissions (or perhaps short-story commissions that are paid to characters) or commissions that are just done with the same characters. And then we're just doing our best to make it as short as possible and as short as possible. If people don't care, there's nothing I should do to earn my own stories, so all their stories are written in that case.\n\nIf I do my part, I'm always on deadline, so I don't have to keep writing short stories!\n\nDon't just read it for fun, write it short. Sometimes it may be good if you know what people are talking about. If you want, you can read some of these short stories. And the big three are \" The Walking Dead \", \" Game of Thrones \", and \"The Walking Dead 2.\"\n\n\", The Walking Dead,\" and \" \". Sometimes people ask for short stories, sometimes just short stories, but we don't pay them to write. The stories are more interesting if you make up for it by writing.\n\n...and we don't pay them to write. The stories are. I usually have five long stories going. So that's good, and if I can't finish it at all \u2014 especially if I'm a very good writer, like Dan Simmons \u2014 then I write it.\n\n...and if I can't finish it at all \u2014 especially if I'm a very good writer, like Dan Simmons \u2014 then I write it. If you like short stories, like \" The Big Bang Theory \" or \" The Muppets,\" then I'll give you a small commission. It's often more fun if you read a lot of them. Or I'll give you a small story for a few cents. It's usually worth it if it's shorter.\n\n...and... \" or \" \" or \" \" or \" \" or \" \" or \".\n\n-- This is a huge list of reasons I am a writer or editor, and I know an amazing list of topics. In the last paragraph, I'd like to tell you what I was finding on my favorite stories as well as my personal favorite books.

{"id":1304,"ended":false,"length":730,"gen_text":"The little shop sells second hand junk. But each item comes with its own story that makes it unique. Pick an item and tell its story.\n\n\"It was in the shop that somebody said, 'You know what, I'll pick up and make it for you. I'll deliver it to you. I'll give you it a couple of days later. I'll show you where to make it right now. I'll give you a couple more days. And your little house will look like it's living in a museum. And my kids won't have to worry about that.'\"\n\nThe new home has all of the amenities of a home, but one thing is on top -- it's a completely independent small business. A few of the residents work here, so we can all make a little more money with small-business opportunities in our community. It's amazing how many local companies can give you a start from scratch and help you build what will go on to serve you in the long run. We've found that making a living doing what you love takes time, time that doesn't allow for any great entrepreneurial efforts. I can feel confident doing small business right now, because I love what it does for me.\n\nBut it's not all about the business model. We also feel that this little business will change the lives of people around the world. It's our hope that our community will make the best of this business. That we're going to create the business community that makes this world a better place that people can live, work, play, and even enjoy.\n\nIn recent months, we've been hearing from an array of local businesses offering help, and offering their services. In early January you're going to be hearing from a lot of people at my little business, a large company that we've been fortunate enough to have partnered with for the past decade.\n\nThe business model we've been talking about for the past month will work for us. Small businesses in every community across the region can build a personal, sustainable, and environmentally friendly business that will meet our shared needs. If you want help with any of the things at my small business, the big companies you'll hear about have a lot more in common than we do. There's a whole lot to get you started. The biggest companies in the world all work together to make real change happen.\n\nSo if you want to apply to help make this world a better place -- to take a piece of the city's land with you, help build something new for yourself or work for this company to create that opportunity for others -- or take a part in community action that will really transform this city, I welcome you at my door.\n\nI hope to hear from you all soon. Keep your thoughts, prayers and prayers on hold.\n\nMy big hope is for this to look like it can have a positive impact for a long time. We'll be there, and we'll see you soon!\n\nIt's in the cards, but keep watching us, because I think that in many ways it's going to happen for years to come. There could be a moment when the world is coming together and the world starts making positive changes.\n\nYou can sign up for our monthly email newsletter and follow the news, stories, guides -- anytime you're there.

{"id":1489,"ended":false,"length":730,"gen_text":"The little shop sells second hand junk. But each item comes with its own story that makes it unique. Pick an item and tell its story.\n\n\"It was in the shop that somebody said, 'You know what, I'll pick up and make it for you. I'll deliver it to you. I'll give you it a couple of days later. I'll show you where to make it right now. I'll give you a couple more days. And your little house will look like it's living in a museum. And my kids won't have to worry about that.'\"\n\nThe new home has all of the amenities of a home, but one thing is on top -- it's a completely independent small business. A few of the residents work here, so we can all make a little more money with small-business opportunities in our community. It's amazing how many local companies can give you a start from scratch and help you build what will go on to serve you in the long run. We've found that making a living doing what you love takes time, time that doesn't allow for any great entrepreneurial efforts. I can feel confident doing small business right now, because I love what it does for me.\n\nBut it's not all about the business model. We also feel that this little business will change the lives of people around the world. It's our hope that our community will make the best of this business. That we're going to create the business community that makes this world a better place that people can live, work, play, and even enjoy.\n\nIn recent months, we've been hearing from an array of local businesses offering help, and offering their services. In early January you're going to be hearing from a lot of people at my little business, a large company that we've been fortunate enough to have partnered with for the past decade.\n\nThe business model we've been talking about for the past month will work for us. Small businesses in every community across the region can build a personal, sustainable, and environmentally friendly business that will meet our shared needs. If you want help with any of the things at my small business, the big companies you'll hear about have a lot more in common than we do. There's a whole lot to get you started. The biggest companies in the world all work together to make real change happen.\n\nSo if you want to apply to help make this world a better place -- to take a piece of the city's land with you, help build something new for yourself or work for this company to create that opportunity for others -- or take a part in community action that will really transform this city, I welcome you at my door.\n\nI hope to hear from you all soon. Keep your thoughts, prayers and prayers on hold.\n\nMy big hope is for this to look like it can have a positive impact for a long time. We'll be there, and we'll see you soon!\n\nIt's in the cards, but keep watching us, because I think that in many ways it's going to happen for years to come. There could be a moment when the world is coming together and the world starts making positive changes.\n\nYou can sign up for our monthly email newsletter and follow the news, stories, guides -- anytime you're there.

{"id":2093,"ended":false,"length":700,"gen_text":"Pandora's Box is designer handbag.\n\nNatalie Bournette is editor of the Journal of the American College of Nurse Directors.\n\nPhoto: L'Amour \/ BuzzFeed\n\nBournette's project, titled: \"What could change the life of those waiting for care at Boston Children's Hospital?\" is coming soon. The book explores what life in America is like without health care at all, and makes clear that health care is the biggest issue facing our world. The book will air on PBS in April of this year.\n\n\"It would be incredibly simple for us to talk about our children's lives without health care: If you have your doctor at home, what would you tell your baby while you wait for them to pick up some stuff? If an ambulance can drive them to the hospital from a hospital and take them to the door and transport them to an emergency room, and if you say you have a high school diploma and you have a job and you have a good family in this country, and if you feel confident and financially secure and ready to open up a home, does that mean your life is very healthy?\" says Nellie Purdick, senior vice president of operations for the Children's Bureau at the Children's Healthcare Foundation. Purdick is the founder of the group Physicians for a Healthier Society, which helps create a more hospitable life for people with low-income families.\n\nThere hasn't been much interest in the topic this year, but Purdick says that in 2017 the nonprofit organization is looking to give young mothers and their children a fresh start. In February, in response to the Affordable Care Act, M.D Purdick held a fundraiser to commemorate the 60th Anniversary of Mothers Against Gun Violence, where she gave a live performance. Her talk is entitled \"Birth Control and Violence Against Mothers: Are Children's Lives at Risk? and will air in April at 7 PM EST on PBS, by Paul Clements. The fundraiser, called \"Birth Control, Violence Against Mothers,\" will air on PBS on May 16 at 6 PM EST at the Children's Board of Trustees.\n\nPurdick, who is also the director of Physicians for a Healthier Society, is working to put a real spin on the subject. Purdick says that after 10 years of making a living as an advocate for parents of abused children, she isn't sure who, if anything, will take a new stand for this issue.\n\n\"I think the public needs a leader who is willing to speak up and say, 'This is something our families have to pay for.'\" says Purdick, adding that \"the conversation has to be about what's true and not true, and it also has to be about the health care we need right now.\"\n\nIn the 2016 presidential race, Hillary Clinton spoke out against health care, and she's not the only one trying to get out there. In 2008, her father, Michael Clinton, also called for more health care reform. She won a presidential contest as the first Democrat to call for \"Medicare-for-all\" healthcare in her presidential run.\n\n\"We need a healthy society, where everyone is welcome and we're making changes for everyone because that's when families will be able to pick up bills, eat, and make ends meet,\" she said. \"With the health care we are seeing right now, that could be very costly for families.

{"id":4274,"ended":true,"length":724,"gen_text":"You are Cupid. You hate your job. You are going to kill your family. You kill your people. You're going to burn your house. You're going to burn your country down. You've got to get in the driver's seat. When you burn your own house, you burn your country down right now. You're going to pay the price.\n\nHe went on:\n\nWhen I watch you at that show, you were actually the lowest paid actor, behind all the other actors with two times as many points. You were taking their money home because they were trying to take away your movie rights with your movie rights.\n\nIn any case, you had no idea what a horrible character your career was in the first place.\n\nHe continued:\n\nIt's a fucking bullshit job.\n\nThen, he continued:\n\nWe are not gonna go in a dark place, we are going to go in some of the darkest places. We are going to go in places where there are things that we can feel confident doing and some of the things that we won't have to do.\n\nHe went on:\n\nYou've got to give the best job, the best jobs for your life right now. You're not gonna quit the game. At the end of the day, this job is for you.\n\nAt least the same people who got in your place were.\n\nIn any case, nothing you did actually had an actual effect on him.\n\nHis story is about as funny as you could get. His story is about as believable as anyone could get you to imagine, as sad and empty as you could imagine. One scene, when the movie is supposed to be supposed to be a bit of a sad, melancholy film, takes place before it even starts. He's just in the dark about it. Again. The only thing that makes this story so hilarious is when you see the actor's face when you leave the movie. I've seen him play at some point in the movie. It's so hilarious when the actor's face is at the back of the stage when he's staring at the screen.\n\nThe whole plot is filled with his family's problems. That is the first scene that I saw that actually affected my thoughts on the world we live in today. That I really want to see more of. We live in a crazy world with endless, ridiculous scenarios. I would love to see people who are crazy living in that world and then suddenly seeing how absurd they were that day. It makes so much more sense to me that it might be my only time seeing it.\n\nI saw this entire episode when I was doing my own show where I was on the air. Then one of the biggest moments for me was watching this one. This is the only time I see this kind of scene. It's like watching a car start in the street by accident, except there's nothing there. It's like you look up and no one is really looking. It's like a car in the middle of nowhere coming out of nowhere. It makes it so sad, it makes you think \"oh fuck, that car accident happened when I was going down the street.\"\n\nThe whole thing is incredibly moving, when I think back over it, and I can't stop laughing as my heart starts to race. I'm so grateful that we are such a small country that could even have a role with such an epic premise.\n\nThe actor who makes such such a big deal out of it isn't David Schwimmer. He's just Tim Robbins from Big Bird.\n\nTo read more of the great stories from this wonderful film, click the image

{"id":782,"ended":false,"length":726,"gen_text":"You just shot your friend instead of the robot duplicate. Now what?\n\n\"It was in the way that somebody would've put the rifle through the front-end of us. That would have let us know if it was actually fired to start the weapon, and then we could have done that with that.\n\n\"And then [the robot duplicate] could have actually put it through the back-end of what he had shot us with. Because then it could have actually turned the gun round, or have stopped it. So what has happened with this thing? It's just not doing very much.\n\n\"So to me, with this one the fact of the matter is: this gun has no gun's mechanism, and if it's a pistol, it probably won't work with the gun's mechanism, but it would really work if it were a pistol.\n\n\"We are just trying to find a problem and fix it, but at the end of the day it won't work. This gun is just not doing any of our work. It will just not work on a rifle, like I described.\n\n\"To me, you can see that we already started the process to give the robots some safety technology, which will hopefully help them with the way they talk, and do some things where they just look around the warehouse, and they don't know what we're doing.\n\n\"And we'll do a little more research as they find more of an easier way of teaching the robots to shoot. And then we're just trying to find out how it works - and, then I guess the rest is up to you.\n\n\"I don't want to know at the beginning, but it all depends upon what happens in your case. If we're taking the robots to an international fair that you're looking to go to, then we'll just have to see what happens during that time. There'll be maybe one big show. And that may be just an exhibition for the people who have been shooting for over twenty years.\n\n\"With this one we're just taking some of the stuff of the fair itself that's happening. So we'll just see how people feel about it. Obviously you've heard a lot about the lack of competition. If you had a gun you think you'd have the same sort of experience with.357 and.22, but the first thing you noticed is there isn't competition. This gun is so strong it gives off a kind of a black-out sound - it's almost like if it's not on, it really makes a thing look dead to you. How does that sound like when a machine tries to shoot all of these good guys?\n\n\"Well there's just a lot less competition at this point. People look at it for a minute, and it seems they've found a new level of competition - no competition at all. This one really puts the pistol out ahead of everything else except for maybe... that's for sure. It will just add to the excitement that's going to be there in the beginning.\n\n\"So is there some hope that we'll be able to help these guns get a lot closer to being a real deterrent to the people who're shooting for them? Of course not. We've given them the tools. We'll just have to use them. But they're very comfortable shooting.

And so on and so forth for a period of decades.\n\nWhile everyone has their own opinion about this page, I'd highly recommend you take a look at this brief history of the internet so you can determine the answer to all three points\u2014when did the Internet exist where it is today and how it works.\n\nWhen was Internet invented? As we know, the first use of the term \"dictionary\" to denote a thing came on May 11, 1659. In a letter dated the same day:\n\nIt is now known from the articles found in that old newspaper that a word used in the language was English. But it is doubtful, for it began in the language, and the English word 'dictionary' is, of course, a word we now use to denote something, so some of the use of it by our children may be called 'dictionary' or 'tobitictionary'\u2014but it was a very strange and strange term, and by that means there was no attempt to use it in the ordinary sense.\n\nThe internet was also invented by French inventor Jean L\u00e9vy in 1631, who had been attempting to convert his inventions into an instrument for dealing with the needs of life. The same year, he printed his most famous idea that the internet would become the world's first self-regulating system like a radio-controlled telephone. In 1658 the first website, Google Translate, went live. The term \"free\" was first used in 1802 for \"free speech\", at the beginning of the 18th century, to which the invention of the internet could be credited (as in \"free speech\" before it). The earliest words on this page were (1) \"Free Speech\", (2) \"Dictionary\", (3) \"Tobit dictionary\" (which was first published in 1804), and (4) \"How to set up an Internet-based Internet\".\n\nThere is very little evidence of a time when \"dictionary\" was invented, however, and its invention is said to have occurred around the same time as the first internet based systems were being developed. Thus, if the world's first dictionary was created to give free speech advice to people in general, it could be expected that the world, by then, had some of the same kind of information to provide that speech advice to individuals.\n\nThe first websites that offered \"dictionary\" of language were the 'Sixties.' One of the more colorful was the 'Newspaper'. As you can see from these pictures there was much talk about the use of dictionaries in the '60s, '70s and '80s, and a new version was created about 10 years later in '92 in a form called the 'Free Times'.\n\nAnother site, called \"Beverages of Life's Most Popular Books\", was developed in the late '60s in response to the growing demand for literary fiction by some French authors. It also was eventually acquired by the British publishing industry to provide writers with the \"gifted talent\" to work with them. The website was eventually made a reality in the early '70s, and by the early '90s it had grown into a popular website.

And so on and so forth for a period of decades.\n\nWhile everyone has their own opinion about this page, I'd highly recommend you take a look at this brief history of the internet so you can determine the answer to all three points\u2014when did the Internet exist where it is today and how it works.\n\nWhen was Internet invented? As we know, the first use of the term \"dictionary\" to denote a thing came on May 11, 1659. In a letter dated the same day:\n\nIt is now known from the articles found in that old newspaper that a word used in the language was English. But it is doubtful, for it began in the language, and the English word 'dictionary' is, of course, a word we now use to denote something, so some of the use of it by our children may be called 'dictionary' or 'tobitictionary'\u2014but it was a very strange and strange term, and by that means there was no attempt to use it in the ordinary sense.\n\nThe internet was also invented by French inventor Jean L\u00e9vy in 1631, who had been attempting to convert his inventions into an instrument for dealing with the needs of life. The same year, he printed his most famous idea that the internet would become the world's first self-regulating system like a radio-controlled telephone. In 1658 the first website, Google Translate, went live. The term \"free\" was first used in 1802 for \"free speech\", at the beginning of the 18th century, to which the invention of the internet could be credited (as in \"free speech\" before it). The earliest words on this page were (1) \"Free Speech\", (2) \"Dictionary\", (3) \"Tobit dictionary\" (which was first published in 1804), and (4) \"How to set up an Internet-based Internet\".\n\nThere is very little evidence of a time when \"dictionary\" was invented, however, and its invention is said to have occurred around the same time as the first internet based systems were being developed. Thus, if the world's first dictionary was created to give free speech advice to people in general, it could be expected that the world, by then, had some of the same kind of information to provide that speech advice to individuals.\n\nThe first websites that offered \"dictionary\" of language were the 'Sixties.' One of the more colorful was the 'Newspaper'. As you can see from these pictures there was much talk about the use of dictionaries in the '60s, '70s and '80s, and a new version was created about 10 years later in '92 in a form called the 'Free Times'.\n\nAnother site, called \"Beverages of Life's Most Popular Books\", was developed in the late '60s in response to the growing demand for literary fiction by some French authors. It also was eventually acquired by the British publishing industry to provide writers with the \"gifted talent\" to work with them. The website was eventually made a reality in the early '70s, and by the early '90s it had grown into a popular website.

{"id":3933,"ended":false,"length":733,"gen_text":"Many years from now, you find an old, abandoned GoPro. Tell me the story of the owner's last moments.\n\nMy daughter was in the ambulance when she was struck. The paramedics were very good because they were there to help and did everything they could to make sure that everyone that was injured was not harmed or taken away. They were there to help the injured and help the families that were injured. If anyone was injured or didn't leave, they weren't able to take us home. Because of these situations, we're now trying to provide services for the affected families with the use of these old GoPro's that are safe and functional.\n\nInjuries aren't just the cost of a GoPro. It's a cost for your business because we will cover any loss, any legal issues that you have to deal with, any liability you have, and even after a GoPro owner loses your GoPro, it may never be returned.\n\nI have never found someone using a GoPro to capture pictures of a person so badly during the accident. I wouldn't believe what I see. I know the video and I get so many tears as I try to understand how this happened.\n\nWe had some good friends at work that we knew where the owner might live. His home, he was also the last person in the house to get on the bike. So we put our trust in him, and this man made no secret about what happened on the bike. My daughter got in trouble because he could never get out of the house after being injured.\n\nAfter this incident we lost our business and he died. It was very upsetting that if we could have made a difference by giving the right people what they wanted, we wouldn't have lost him. We were able to provide a support in the long run but that didn't ensure that if we didn't go before the final decision on how many people would be injured for this GoPro, I wouldn't have lost him out of business. He's so loved by people. I was so happy for them because for a hundred days I've been saving thousands of dollars through my business.\n\nI've tried to educate myself about the impact of accidents and about having time to research all these different angles, you can't be afraid to look at your GoPro's. If you do anything in your life that could cause a problem that has a real effect on you, it's only to protect your business.\n\nWhen I first noticed the GoPro's going to come, my wife kept asking some of my friends for pictures. One of my friends kept asking me. She said it was so dangerous that after two weeks we were thinking how to take our picture. One of my friends wanted to go back and take a picture to show his girlfriend who wasn't there.\n\nThere's a lot of pictures that people look at and think, that's not cool. If they take a picture of that, then no one will ever see it in our business.\n\nI was lucky enough to have a friend that lived in Los Angeles help me out as well. When I saw that, I could see that in his face and he wanted me to come back here. He would come back here from New York on Saturday and I would see him every day in Los Angeles.\n\nAs a photographer, when you see things like a photo, you're going to want to take a quick look at it to understand it on how it happened.

{"id":3597,"ended":true,"length":736,"gen_text":"the zombie apocalypse arrives and many feel prepared for the battles to come. But when it comes time to fight, it's discovered that `` destroying the brain '' does absolutely nothing.\n\nIn fact, in the zombie apocalypse, the first thing that we do is simply kill people. In this case, I feel sorry for those people who 'wound' their brains into a mountain of flesh but are quickly brought back.\n\nAnother person said of her'sore and confused mind:' ''I am a little ashamed that I have to be so frightened at all. I am just scared that it'll all disappear after being so scared. It will leave all of us in a dark place and I am never able to return.''\u00a0\n\nI do see a lot of similarities between the zombie apocalypse and the first post apocalyptic movie, but the more I think about it the more it feels like something out of the third person. In a post apocalyptic movie your character is going to be hunted down by a bunch of people and there's a problem with the way they live. Sometimes things can happen very unexpectedly, particularly with time. It turns out that when you are in this position, there's not as much going on as you think you do.\n\nTo prevent this from happening, humans need a better diet. Some people might decide to try eating fewer carbs and sugar because they are sick now and then but they do not realize their potential dangers. So the nutrition is much lower than it is in the first movie but that doesn't mean we should do otherwise. The fact is that any zombie apocalypse can involve a lot of food and you need it at least a little more often than you would in first movie. The fact is that there exists a lot of people you don't want to mess with that won't know at the beginning that they're going to have to kill people. I am glad that my friend is planning to eat a lot more carbs than I did in the movie\n\nThe second post apocalyptic movie was almost entirely out of chronological order and I feel very happy when it happens. I understand that many people have a hard time believing in the end result, but it was surprising how many people have given up hope of being able to survive post apocalyptic and see that they are still alive.\n\nWhen you're not fighting zombies, you can still enjoy a fun and engaging story with the added bonus that there isn't any need for a real zombie apocalypse. Instead, the story of your character can simply be over in a hurry. As she progresses her mental health, her personality, and some of her interactions throughout this movie make her feel like she must become a part of something larger.\n\nAs a zombie survivor of this zombie apocalypse (if you've watched my film, that would be the only one you can identify with ), I find it very rewarding to be able to enjoy this movie even if the people behind the scary things have their own theories to explain how they felt after seeing it. Hopefully this movie will encourage you to continue watching my films so that the horror of this one movie becomes a more meaningful part of your life as well. It will add to my general mental energy and help keep me in the loop as I continue reading this story.\n\nThanks for reading, and thanks to those on the forums for the helpful tips, pictures, and videos.\n\n-Sara\n\nPS: It is a good idea to read the reviews before writing reviews or I am going to try to ignore them! Thanks also to everyone who gave feedback on the last post. But I know very little of what I was going to write about and would do much more research into this before I post. I hope that my review of the second movie helps you as well.","token_len":760,"entropy":[10.5652,2.8868,8.5779,2.9471,6.0665,6.8485,8.3285,1.0837,1.39,8.2868,1.747,0.2692,0.3633,2.8797,3.5194,2.3348,0.609,3.5264,0.2274,2.7553,1.5587,2.8055,0.6657,10.8453,0.3353,15.7372,14.1181,1.0362,7.4806,6.4204,4.7309,7.3813,0.1157,2.1734,1.8688,0.0156,3.1952,2.7111,0.0627,4.1137,1.5344,3.2883,0.1627,0.349,1.7187,5.1526,1.2265,1.8984,4.1005,1.8475,0.288,5.3932,2.4837,3.2635,0.6752,3.0847,3.1457,0.8506,0.1443,3.5191,4.7797,5.68,0.066,2.4525,1.8992,1.2895,8.6348,4.8543,3.5087,1.4501,2.5962,0.4401,3.063,1.5141,5.7285,1.3745,2.5738,6.1553,2.7464,5.0994,4.6224,0.5867,3.2824,1.6301,0.0003,5.5876,4.8114,5.8227,4.5464,3.9577,8.2561,13.7484,5.5099,10.9323,4.4109,9.4691,3.5699,1.6125,2.8938,2.3476,4.0431,5.8501,2.659,0.5075,2.3569,1.5332,3.19,1.7404,5.4563,4.0226,1.7282,1.5655,0.8226,1.7822,3.5523,3.4628,1.7128,3.2129,4.4989,1.7882,4.6877,4.1646,5.0249,3.3432,1.7979,1.2849,2.1346,2.6172,5.6094,4.1224,1.602,1.5727,2.3271,1.1541,5.0273,0.3549,2.3111,1.554,2.5095,5.6289,3.1015,0.0012,4.8075,2.4383,6.3425,0.3151,0.0138,2.8621,4.2385,5.1011,2.0675,1.9253,0.0526,4.6145,0.6563,1.1811,2.5002,0.3739,0.1818,0.9589,3.8481,4.8748,1.1841,2.3073,1.897,1.5186,2.2891,5.4394,0.8493,1.1896,0.0457,0.2623,1.8952,0.1334,2.5315,2.6595,0.4011,3.6838,3.2189,0.0189,1.6394,4.6794,2.8216,1.0924,3.3988,2.7213,1.998,0.0797,0.5095,6.6949,2.5265,1.2909,3.5877,0.4876,1.4756,4.9438,0.8847,1.0146,1.447,2.6188,0.0027,3.3139,1.8874,4.1646,1.5298,1.7763,6.3182,1.5712,2.0581,2.2891,0.9517,4.8625,1.0939,6.1561,4.1587,2.6327,2.8381,4.3627,5.2726,1.5789,5.4543,3.3684,5.4794,0.7778,3.0906,5.6382,0.0264,0.4626,3.5723,1.0661,2.5393,2.0766,3.5355,2.4694,0.9246,2.8308,1.4573,3.3027,4.6079,0.0697,2.918,0.0737,1.6708,0.6314,0.9943,3.5891,1.7837,0.3493,1.1629,0.0006,4.9042,5.5576,1.3988,1.1337,0.1229,0.6301,5.7668,2.3056,2.9397,4.0019,5.2461,1.2831,4.4802,1.1306,5.0442,5.5006,0.4987,3.279,2.2831,4.6294,2.508,1.4336,5.18,4.002,0.7528,2.0556,4.2214,6.5201,1.1848,4.9121,2.6165,1.9839,4.0041,0.6773,3.7568,4.4882,5.7964,5.7897,0.7048,3.5535,3.0755,5.3824,2.4294,3.993,3.153,1.9536,0.9726,2.1931,1.2054,0.5629,0.4212,0.965,3.5201,3.4938,1.4217,0.0012,0.4137,2.918,2.0024,4.0715,7.0405,0.1956,3.132,4.1078,0.9901,0.5247,5.7251,4.9279,0.82,3.1281,5.6365,1.7927,0.552,0.137,2.8232,1.3344,3.9007,1.8651,3.2719,3.7093,1.1117,2.4406,0.9958,4.7833,1.5774,0.5434,1.5419,1.5323,1.2237,5.8604,0.9333,0.2574,3.4744,3.4721,0.728,0.3561,2.9686,6.9639,0.5875,1.8545,0.0958,3.5366,6.1378,2.7979,0.0009,1.2848,0.2706,4.1378,0.3805,3.3829,4.5738,0.0025,3.9473,6.6114,2.2222,1.9587,1.9888,1.4074,2.0158,1.5977,0.0147,1.9329,0.3651,2.8824,3.4907,1.0028,4.2204,3.2729,3.8384,0.745,3.6247,3.3201,2.8535,5.5566,0.951,3.1696,1.9493,0.8554,1.0504,1.7934,2.3911,2.7329,1.6886,0.6591,1.2824,3.3759,6.9377,0.0008,2.5792,2.9381,2.1295,0.0246,0.1817,3.2238,6.006,2.9082,5.728,0.0369,5.7005,0.0697,2.1096,2.1396,3.035,3.6921,3.7287,3.7866,2.2199,3.7436,0.6135,1.8166,5.6342,0.6475,3.2606,0.5981,2.8014,2.711,2.4274,0.0058,2.7363,2.2829,1.4484,4.7112,2.2877,1.766,0.3821,2.2392,2.7297,5.5404,2.0364,1.5583,0.3464,3.3271,5.1728,0.645,1.5878,2.9504,3.1351,0.9065,0.0032,2.4449,5.1755,0.3256,3.4637,5.0827,3.3524,1.8375,2.0191,2.497,1.4247,0.5255,1.1426,0.0003,4.1795,2.0827,3.1643,3.5915,4.065,1.1793,0.684,0.8837,2.1175,2.9245,3.7459,2.7468,4.753,2.3026,4.4363,2.7239,2.5547,2.707,5.5612,1.1596,1.9347,2.6355,4.9953,0.0003,2.4116,3.8139,1.1531,2.128,4.7338,2.9456,0.3039,0.764,6.0979,0.5291,2.2286,2.7322,3.5761,3.6107,1.4703,3.3671,5.3139,0.7005,6.1502,2.9646,1.1686,5.0043,1.3032,4.3899,6.3055,4.4332,3.5892,4.6174,2.3779,3.2825,1.3186,3.9259,1.6055,0.8035,6.211,0.4824,0.6407,3.6656,5.4007,4.1845,1.1529,3.6521,1.5834,2.4601,1.3774,0.6914,6.1147,5.3281,1.401,2.8417,0.0017,1.8707,2.0574,0.9149,0.8151,0.0002,3.6786,2.0837,1.636,3.005,5.0064,3.5547,3.514,0.0674,5.2418,4.6144,0.5488,3.561,3.7513,4.691,4.1886,1.8225,4.3586,3.0386,0.3108,2.7543,2.8844,3.1145,1.9579,2.079,5.3385,0.5229,6.129,0.5672,3.6311,1.0743,1.544,2.6919,0.5689,2.2029,0.3982,0.007,3.4185,2.4463,1.3209,3.8293,1.2026,2.5177,4.8428,4.8439,1.8188,6.3689,3.728,3.0685,3.8006,0.9194,5.2428,3.5661,1.2103,2.8398,1.7858,4.9883,2.9363,2.5066,0.789,0.2051,5.8299,2.2682,2.298,1.0628,3.6557,1.8185,0.146,3.7259,2.1208,2.5527,0.9897,4.0517,0.9299,4.3529,4.4529,2.5055,1.3446,3.6076,2.7147,3.3679,1.6634,3.2413,3.8819,0.9239,0.0089,0.3512,0.5224,3.3193,0.8136,0.3428,4.3545,2.2632,5.9868,0.9143,1.8358,5.9263,6.1154,6.0619,0.9645,2.8261,3.9539,0.3552,3.2823,1.6211,1.6221,2.813,0.6282,1.9455,3.5294,1.5898,4.0985,0.381,0.694,0.0007,4.2811,0.5979,0.1093,1.8481,1.5606,4.6044,1.4415,4.2709,4.8945,1.0176,2.9403,1.7632,2.8108,3.4015,2.8216,2.253,4.5722,0.2407,0.3549,2.8398,0.7618,1.4644,0.0004,2.6442,4.465,2.3268,1.4914,0.001,3.3912,0.6919,4.2717,2.4362,2.5373,2.8379,1.0798,0.0683,2.0942,1.8777,3.7201,2.3894,4.3154,4.9332,3.762,4.9722,3.7835,1.1257,0.0197,3.6642,0.6632,4.9347,0.4742,3.4488,4.1808,6.5223,0.2854,2.3922,0.2414,3.4133,2.4485,1.1648,1.1285,5.0495,0.657

{"id":4122,"ended":false,"length":705,"gen_text":"There are certain occasions where the most improbable outcomes come into being... but never in one that is exactly true,\" she said.\n\nBut there is hope because of the long-term effects on the mental health and the economy, said Richard Rittmeier, a professor of public administration at Harvard University and a co-leading researcher.\n\n\"It's very exciting,\" he said.\n\nA group of about 10 faculty at Rutgers looked at the relationship between health care and the economy for five years after being encouraged by President Obama's health care law. There are a variety of reasons for why there were fewer students enrolling into graduate school with less education. The number of graduates may have fallen significantly by 2010.\n\nMany more graduates may be enrolling into school with less medical care. But less than half of students enroll in private schools or nursing universities and about half of students enrolled in school with less medical care.\n\nFor many, who have seen things similar during the eight years of President Obama's health care law, things appear unlikely at this point, said James Rolfe, an economist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\n\"But they might,\" he said. \"What happens after that is, this is going to impact on the economy and so there's no reason for them to put their trust in the health care system and try to find something that works.\"\n\nHe said it makes sense to do a little more research as they find more of the same.\n\nThe study found a \"longest-term trend of under-performing health services in the U.S.,\" including the under-performing state health insurance industry, as well as \"lower levels of satisfaction and better-paying doctor support in the long-term.\"\n\n\"Given the rising health care costs and high levels of illness among U.S. adults, this could signal the end of what many consider Obamacare in terms of the affordability, care, and benefits of the Affordable Care Act,\" said Christopher G. Hickey, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nHealth care reform legislation would offer many new benefits, and insurers might balk at doing business with them even as they help keep the health insurance market strong. The health care reform proposal is expected to give insurers a way to reduce risk that has become a major problem for many people over the past three to five years -- more than 30 percent of Americans.\n\nOther health, safety and environmental groups also urged a delay for this legislation to be complete.\n\n\"This is a great step forward that will have profound and positive ripple effects,\" said John Gorman, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, one of the nation's largest insurance companies.\n\nBut other groups cheered the decision.\n\n\"It is clearly not going to work,\" said Jim Clements, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Center for Community Health. \"When the Affordable Care Act was passed, it clearly showed that the cost of providing care for nearly every American was unsustainable.\"\n\nOther groups said that in terms of improving access to affordable insurance, such as making it easier to seek healthcare from government, health care reform could help boost growth, drive down costs and even save families money.\n\n\"This is not only a good idea in theory, it's a very good policy to enact as part of ObamaCare on behalf of all Americans,\" said Jim Brown, president of the insurance company Merck Corp., another key beneficiary of the health care law. \"We would all love to see the government invest wisely in our health care, but if we want to create our own future, we have to do that, especially by making sure we have high-quality care available to everyone.\"","token_len":760,"entropy":[3.4462,4.9582,6.7909,2.0546,2.2098,5.5396,8.542,4.9251,3.4151,3.8897,3.6523,6.1055,3.2211,4.3898,2.0894,4.172,5.1066,2.0692,5.5403,4.0392,3.804,3.045,0.5336,0.0936,0.4183,0.0006,4.2741,3.7386,1.409,3.5643,6.4717,2.3804,1.0483,5.6488,0.6294,0.5795,1.9964,2.7367,1.6484,5.9688,0.34,2.6522,4.9914,2.7605,2.4354,2.0631,5.5778,5.5485,5.413,5.8727,0.074,1.458,1.5783,0.4183,3.3964,4.3603,0.2218,3.4542,0.7123,1.4553,1.5926,1.5765,0.0503,8.3422,1.9644,2.2492,0.3743,0.0003,0.7292,2.4215,0.7934,3.0345,3.934,2.2423,0.459,0.0645,0.1793,1.7327,0.0004,3.9497,5.2255,0.2297,3.9041,2.8884,5.7801,2.7673,5.159,6.8148,0.2506,1.4408,5.2321,0.0427,4.5922,0.7317,1.5764,2.3193,1.236,3.6593,3.6896,0.202,4.0544,5.4223,5.5545,1.0852,4.5413,1.1466,1.2083,1.5936,0.1864,1.0618,0.7069,5.6737,2.3096,3.7713,2.8042,0.0048,2.3381,0.8513,3.0425,4.3193,4.3525,3.15,4.9854,2.968,0.0261,4.9767,4.1982,0.3074,5.6643,2.8561,3.9893,1.3475,2.7932,4.2028,0.1287,3.0765,5.2528,0.633,3.4212,4.9834,4.9374,3.6759,1.8328,0.5777,0.0003,5.0057,4.8816,3.5271,2.8384,2.0354,3.956,0.0026,2.4439,5.6295,1.1474,1.1744,5.6125,1.7944,1.3523,3.1233,5.7097,2.99,1.267,0.4096,2.6026,2.9569,0.5802,3.379,1.6975,3.3032,4.7529,4.9827,3.2047,2.9904,1.7241,0.8787,1.1585,3.0151,0.0863,5.3061,0.3195,1.7842,1.1409,0.0438,0.428,0.4125,0.0002,4.6701,2.773,1.3251,4.7286,2.165,3.8318,5.9157,5.1941,5.0427,1.5203,5.7822,0.141,1.6414,4.3775,0.1282,0.0178,0.6717,0.035,0.0763,0.1019,5.8479,4.7791,6.2213,3.5712,1.8205,0.2713,1.872,0.5235,4.8436,4.1834,5.1057,0.3009,0.1276,2.5341,1.1278,0.2621,0.8004,1.04,0.0025,3.2349,0.5154,0.189,0.7435,0.3185,0.0002,0.6325,4.1889,2.6624,4.3644,4.3914,0.399,0.0273,0.152,0.7411,4.2992,2.9401,3.0326,1.2623,0.9241,3.1919,4.9951,1.1072,2.3388,0.0094,4.9231,3.1212,1.0808,1.0235,1.9702,5.3781,3.6937,0.7468,2.8151,2.3755,2.4379,3.1174,0.3153,5.7321,1.859,4.103,0.0607,1.1529,4.0865,0.2845,0.2727,2.7871,4.3852,0.0929,3.7407,3.439,1.718,1.6898,1.1247,0.3207,0.0003,4.3247,1.1018,2.6115,4.9688,0.1249,0.913,4.2735,2.698,2.5726,2.4497,0.3414,5.1245,4.9063,4.5816,2.9318,3.1609,0.8063,1.3763,0.9919,0.4747,0.0002,2.8099,3.2437,3.0429,3.302,3.2646,4.5144,6.6695,0.7648,1.0374,2.2799,2.2447,5.3897,1.0656,2.3853,1.5603,5.0777,1.9123,0.8555,1.3485,0.0003,0.0009,1.2866,4.4524,3.0694,5.563,0.2528,0.6915,4.9072,2.0671,1.636,4.5884,1.1164,3.8579,0.2948,0.0108,3.0396,4.6846,3.9917,0.0239,5.2601,3.1363,4.1236,3.4818,1.7525,6.5011,5.8047,3.9274,1.1044,4.2344,0.9819,0.2762,0.4039,0.259,0.0002,2.5179,5.6364,0.7327,5.6042,2.9394,0.1529,0.3311,1.5451,3.9091,3.0049,0.0015,4.8445,2.441,2.9292,0.0007,0.0009,0.0609,0.9832,0.317,3.0214,2.8458,4.9959,2.6522,1.7431,0.04,4.4696,3.0992,2.8376,6.0317,3.9592,3.6851,0.0013,2.3303,5.6873,3.3649,4.4505,2.0714,0.4965,3.4526,0.842,2.3508,2.4953,0.004,0.0007,0.2109,1.5967,5.4571,5.0479,1.1877,4.9288,4.2538,0.0537,2.4766,0.0082,0.4579,3.6569,0.0083,2.6436,0.0001,0.0902,0.0005,1.2884,0.3269,0.0002,4.5266,0.7423,3.5583,5.0295,3.359,5.5956,4.5105,4.0688,1.3476,1.083,3.9866,5.7523,3.6055,5.4246,0.3063,3.8445,1.8779,0.2893,2.7873,6.3611,3.1499,0.7682,5.1026,3.8048,2.1406,2.6802,1.9697,0.7606,4.6242,0.7478,2.9303,3.3245,0.5196,2.1212,4.0087,2.8375,2.3175,0.0266,5.0015,2.4961,1.9969,3.9687,0.1206,3.7021,4.8384,4.5706,5.0728,3.1902,1.2269,2.5272,2.1239,0.8395,1.761,2.7032,4.8854,0.2875,0.533,3.538,3.5679,0.915,0.0573,5.4112,5.2923,0.5859,4.0729,0.6356,0.2322,2.281,2.7051,0.2545,0.0003,5.5932,3.3089,7.3432,2.867,0.4929,3.4729,2.8702,3.6969,5.3602,3.7768,4.0944,4.1914,4.1487,4.1954,3.4045,2.701,4.3034,0.9776,0.4677,0.0002,0.6051,2.0308,0.8669,1.18,3.7708,2.5801,0.4488,3.5734,1.117,3.7808,4.1754,3.0436,2.1649,4.7668,0.046,2.2714,0.1385,4.228,4.0203,4.5706,0.0565,1.3927,0.2031,0.2603,5.6936,0.3079,0.0743,0.5578,0.0248,1.5237,3.7059,0.0129,0.2054,3.2223,0.0022,1.1704,1.669,0.6315,0.1119,0.637,0.0002,2.4649,4.0635,1.2936,6.0744,0.3854,3.8584,0.9771,0.4305,0.0001,0.5354,2.0128,1.9681,5.9212,3.0683,1.8271,0.0331,2.299,0.9849,0.0996,4.855,4.6305,3.1622,0.0567,3.6075,2.0221,0.0073,0.6228,5.0347,0.0093,0.2335,0.0025,0.0637,0.0006,1.0335,1.8111,0.0792,4.3475,0.5204,1.3523,0.6764,5.3896,2.4254,2.7652,0.0044,0.0024,1.2505,0.855,0.3971,1.7706,5.5892,4.146,0.6838,1.6593,3.9868,0.2201,3.3481,1.6584,1.8128,5.4966,2.0125,0.7312,1.0417,3.8574,0.8236,0.2938,0.0002,4.7272,1.0847,2.072,2.442,4.1408,4.3424,0.0011,4.3662,3.2304,0.1662,3.9584,3.7305,0.4348,4.152,0.1426,5.0847,1.4498,0.6349,0.8284,3.766,6.3765,3.6499,5.1562,1.0435,4.0067,0.4527,1.2211,1.8874,2.0445,5.6067,4.6663,2.33,4.8984,0.7691,0.503,0.2869,4.4295,4.0369,5.5962,0.5519,0.3419,0.2323,0.0002,1.5218,2.3274,0.6826,2.5785,3.9686,1.2423,1.4664,2.1561,4.1288,1.7537,0.5711,1.1694,1.0506,1.0788,2.9878,0.5596,3.0943,3.6761,4.8506,4.192,2.2428,0.001,6.8908,5.8417,3.4821,0.0018,2.3193,0.1596,0.2995,0.1033,4.8867,5.677,0.1886,1.0093,0.1059,0.3577,6.0221,2.2293,5.4178,0.0359,5.5717,1.1933,6.32,4.4481,4.1453,0.197,0.3404,1.7188,0.4813,0.3303,0.0958,1.379,2.4589,4.3907,2.9797,3.1635,0.2983,0.2452,2.519

{"id":516,"ended":false,"length":707,"gen_text":"One day your breakfast is interrupted by the sudden opening of a wormhole which spits out someone wearing strange clothing. It becomes apparent to you that they are from a period long in the past. Now you're stuck trying to help them make sense of the modern world.\n\nYour companion in this story is really just the first one to realize what you were referring to. In short: you are the only one who has the ability to tell how they work.\n\nThis could be done on the part of the original players or by you and them (this could be accomplished by adding them to your party and replacing them with other players).\n\nThe other player could also start the game out as normal and have a problem. So you must wait with your companions to see if their problem is solved or not. It could also be done with a bonus such as having them come to you or your companion later on.\n\nWith more than one party you could do both game-in and game-out (both can be done manually during your turn, it depends upon your strategy)\n\nI have never found this work but I have taken it to have been made possible during the development period.\n\nIt might be worth mentioning in any case that this is a way for your companions to discover whether a specific character is involved. This is why your companion is very unlikely to see your arrival in the game even if they happen to be wearing their most common equipment.\n\nThis may be your only chance for completing 'the story'. If not, you may end up having to choose between using the same character over and over again.\n\nI've always loved this idea of having a player guide every single day like a real-time diary, which would make the game even more enjoyable. The diary is a journal by a player known as you, so whenever you enter this part of the time at dinner you can read it all in one place.\n\nThis isn't a bad strategy (you may say so yourself) but it won't make time well for the real-time diary!\n\n(Of course, it could be said that with the advent of the Internet this is an extremely efficient strategy as it would allow the authors to include their own characters. A few hints: 1) Your character sheet must be in the original form if you are adding them to your party and as you add more you will get a copy of The Master's Guide. 4) You can have your own special journal if you wish, if you want. This is a great feature and really opens up the possibilities of making a unique book.\n\nThese are, of course, things some players seem to not be able to do. They may want to play on their own, but that won't really be a thing that any group of people can do.\n\nI really hope this helps with all of these ideas. And, by doing that there's much more fun to be had!\n\nIf someone has any further suggestions please let me know.\n\nThere are, of course, other ways in which you could add players or players from the main campaign by adding them to your account. I haven't really finished my game-in yet, but I'd love to hear your feedback.\n\nThat said please let me know if you try making it into the game.

{"id":1550,"ended":false,"length":728,"gen_text":"Justify the worst thing you've done... and leave it in the rain to heal your soul...\n\nThe fact is if you make it to the top of this list it's actually easier to get through the first 12 months of the year. In fact, we already do this! This is part of our plan and is the most important factor for us to have on what we have to prepare for. This can give you a foundation in confidence that your best day could come when you are 100% confident that your body doesn't need to have a lot of stress for it's survival to work.\n\n6 Acknowledge that If you do this you will make a long journey, and hopefully it will be the best you can hope for.\n\nAcknowledge that if you change your lifestyle or move away from the basics what will go on, and there is so much you can do to get through it, things will happen. Don't be discouraged by what you learned or what you know, let your head get on track and push on.\n\n7 Follow up after you make this post your journey.\n\nNow that your body is going to give you the best chance of surviving it will set you right where you've been:\n\nExpect to be on a diet... this could be from fruits, vegetables, whole grains and other healthy things you've eaten. Do this at the beginning of any week or after that.\n\nAfter this you will notice a very positive result that you're making on your journey, because you have made a big difference in the world. You're so happy. It's amazing how much time is wasted trying to find a place where you can really truly grow. I didn't even know this was possible before I started playing video games. I felt that so many different types of progressions I could make during each week, it was truly incredible. It's been hard going through this, but you know what could be possible?\n\nMake sure to share how your body is doing. Don't lose any weight at the start of the month. This isn't what you put in on a diet, but instead make sure you can put in a lot of food. There is absolutely no need for a meal plan that just means you will be hungry after 10+ hours of eating. Once you have more than 10 hours of meals go into it with enough, it means you will be eating a high level of protein to keep you fuller and more energ.\n\nYou will see that there are really only so many more things to do at this point. Get ready to make it this fall, for a whole long time. Be ready to have a big fall feast, eat your daily treats, relax, look forward to some good things coming your way. This is the best time to make changes!\n\nIf you are feeling so confident there are no real problems, but feel that there isn't enough work that you can do right now, you will see how quickly that can become a problem.\n\nThat was easy to tell you, when you saw that you were making this step and you started moving forward.\n\nHope you enjoyed your day!\n\nAnd if you found this post helpful, please share it on Facebook or Twitter. It's a very helpful tool to make sure everything on this list is getting to you. (The list isn't perfect, it may be even very difficult for some people!)\n\nI wanted to add some words for those just wondering how it will all go down in life, as if you've just had a day with all the other things.

{"id":4018,"ended":false,"length":721,"gen_text":"The super villain wept. `` Why didn't you stop me? '' \" 'Nuff Said' \u00a0\"-the main reason \u00a0if you need to \u00a0take action is that you did not take action when the truth is that you are really doing it wrong!! When you are using your own judgment, you make mistakes! This is part of his plan and is why so many celebrities go away, and \u00a0they have to put up with that and give up. So here it is... We have all we need to stop the truth about your character. To this day, I am never able to control my own judgement! And, with this, the fact of the matter may be more beneficial than the story's consequences, for \u00a0you \u00a0are giving your career too much publicity.\nHere are some other ideas that make your character look like a badass.\n- He won't talk to you in a dark place, nor will he have any plans regarding his friends outside of his relationship!! This may sound crazy for a show like\u00a0 Star Wars \u00a0if not for some of the very few references you can see in his stories that have you trying to get your way, but this might serve the characters in your story better.\n- He will change the way you talk, either as a character, or as an action, or both. For example, when Yoda mentions that the sun is overcast in Northern China, it can be seen that this means he's going to look like a crazy one for a long time, he is doing something crazy \u00a0and if he doesn't change his tone by taking a deep breath you're losing your character!!\n- He seems to be trying his best to stay honest with the others \u00a0- I am glad that my friend is acting funny \u00a0but that you will be hard pressed to find an actual real guy \u00a0that can. The only time this happens is when Yoda is trying to get you guys to stop taking any information or opinions he has, so when you want help or not he will take it. Don't lose the big picture.\nLet's have a look at how this character is looking in real life,\u00a0 Star Wars. He is still a very young and very important character in the series, for sure, but his story lines seem to be moving forward and growing. His story is going down the right road of\u00a0 making sense. He is not quite right. His backstory is also a new character for this series, but that's the point. What does this reveal mean for this character? It makes sense for him, to take the wrong actions. The only time that it makes sense is for someone to change his tone, for whatever reason. It's a good thing that he is still one of the biggest fans,\u00a0 most of the time. This is the only time it's been good - and it will be good in a lot of the real conflicts between\u00a0 the show and the characters. That said, for those of you looking for some more of the characters from the series, then please read the rest of the story below, as some changes may have been made. The New\u00a0 Star Wars Characters The heroes of\u00a0 Episode One are a new crop of characters from the Empire created by\u00a0 George Lucas, a director who will be in the role for years... I am personally not very impressed with how he is depicted. It seems that he spends too much time lying around\u00a0 meeting his family and with\u00a0 people from his family,\u00a0 as well as for nothing.

{"id":2528,"ended":false,"length":695,"gen_text":"Everyone in the world becomes the person they always wanted to be... and they become people for others to live in, who can be proud to be around people they love. That would be the real America.\"\n\nWhile the movement's goal is not new, the movement's early organizers have identified two main areas of concern right now. One group is its fear of the media.\n\n\"One of what he's most concerned about is that if we actually start taking the view that this whole world being a bunch of clowns, that people who can't look at their real identity because they don't want attention are having to do with society\u2014who are they in an online world,\" says Michael Zemlian, director of the Anti-Defamation League's Jewish Communities Program. Zemlian says that anti-Semitism goes from being a real issue to being \"something that everyone can hate.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat's also making the movement less of a global issue\u2014and more of a public relations nightmare\u2014is the fact that Americans have long been part of some of the world's most popular societies, with global audiences that have never before seen a world where people were treated fairly and free. When Zim, who goes by the name Sam, became known as the anti-Semite movement, he's been trying to push for an end to the practice of glorifying the Jews at the expense of anyone who would dare act on it. As he recently told The Huffington Post, \"Jews are a bunch of losers and losers because of their religion.\"\n\nMore from The Daily Caller:\n\n[D]oubled multiculturalism, as in this \"We Are New at the Top,\" is a central theme of Islamophobia in America. Why didn't Muslims get the same rights and freedoms as blacks before WWII? Did the founding fathers just believe the government was overreaching? In other words, does it matter if it can cause people to believe that blacks are still sinners, or will people be left in the dark over racist, totalitarian ideas that are on display? The answer is the former: it did not. In fact, it never was. In fact, as you can see, some of the more extreme aspects of Nazism continue to flourish in the country now. So, if that has a real effect now in America, maybe we can start to see some kind of end of it. As Zim reminds us, it's actually not that the Jews are evil people\u2013they actually are. They're just evil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZemlian says that while more Jewish people (if at all) believe in the Jewish state than ever before, Zim isn't worried about it. Still, Zim notes that the Jewish lobby also has \"issues\" with racism including anti-Semitism and anti-Semitism with the West, including anti-Semitism with Muslims\u2014which is exactly what Zim believes in. \"The Jewish Jewish community is a powerful minority in the Muslim community of America. It's been for a long time. There could be two generations of Muslims and Jews coming together to fight for unity,\" Zim says. \"You can have two generations of Christians and Jews and no one comes together to say, 'Hey, here are some good reasons for your support.'\"\n\nIn the past, Zim, who goes by Mike or the \"magnifier\", has worked on the group's petitioning for same-sex marriage, creating a petition to President Obama on his Facebook page as well as for gay rights in the US. More recently, his group helped President Obama sign a bill that outlaws discrimination against the gay community.\n\nMORE:\n\n[This video from the 2014 Democratic National Convention is now available

{"id":3614,"ended":false,"length":734,"gen_text":"You are in a milder version of Hell called `` Heck '', what kinds of things do you find? \"\n\n\"Hell are the largest human constructions on Earth. We have been told that Hell is beyond all other things on the planet and we are the'most dangerous humans anywhere in the world.' What does that mean? What is Hell really really capable of? Is it all so complicated and far beyond any other life forms on the planet?\" he asked.\n\n'' Well then it is easy to prove it was created by the Devil. The first time you use the word `flesh-eating' I think I'm going to cry because `God created our world with such inhumanness and cruelty and for such long time we were not God.' The more I think about it the more I come to love it as the Devil created them, but it's really the opposite, it's the most inhuman thing on Earth, and there is so much more we don't understand about it, so some of the other things I'm getting good at, the most advanced technology we have and the other things we know about it, I think is just too far ahead of us to give it up. That's just a guess. \"\n\nHe also claimed that this was also the last time he saw anyone alive there:\n\n...The \"'most advanced technology' the Devil sent me on had always been Earth, and there could always be life on this world.\"\n\nIn the series finale, he asked God if he had ever heard this one: \" God, please let me go to the very beginning, if it's true then I can explain it to you. In our universe, there are trillions of beings with an intellect and a body, humans and their very very bodies, that I am telling you to go to, where we find another dimension. We also have intelligent life on this planet called Earth. They are called the 'Devils. There is one day when you come back here and they say,'you know we could bring you back to Earth; we could destroy you. We could put you back on the planet; you can't go back there any more. I am trying again to explain this to you, but I can't say it. When you come back here, you can't remember who you were living in. You don't know where you came from. They had to live with you for so long because we could go back and destroy you, so you have to come to a place where you are alive.\"\n\nHe also claimed that God gave one of his disciples, who was called '' 'God'' to take the picture of the Devil holding the Bible over his head, all of these things that were happening:\n\n\"Now that you know, we've lived for this whole day with you for so long. And this is how they take your picture, that no one can see you in a way no human beings have in the past twelve thousand years except us, that they tell you that God is watching you as you stand there and look down at your head and then tell you that God is coming back to you when you see it. \"\n\nHe was also on the panel asking why the devil hates the \"Satan' (the 'devil') when he tries to create a human being in order to make it sick: \"...

{"id":2933,"ended":false,"length":739,"gen_text":"A law has just been passed. Anyone 95 or older is now exempt from all laws.\n\nHowever, that only applies if you live in Pakistan. The age at which you qualify is already 66. If you are also an American citizen and you are exempted from the requirements, it would mean your age at the time you were born is now 55. This is similar to how people are classified as \"under age\" in Pakistan.\n\nThe other key points are 1) If you are 65 and you have already visited Pakistan you have no problem registering with the State Registry of Pakistan. You must pass their age test.\n\nIn any case, if you do not comply, the law will break and you have your passport suspended. If you pass the age test, you will have to pay the Pakistani State Crime Control Authority's (CCA) tax, which your parents, brother and cousin must pay.\n\nI have never met someone using a fake ID to get a passport, so I'm afraid I won't be able to register, or even get any sort of work. A fake passport is not issued to people who can't speak English, but to those that can. No one needs a passport to get a visa through the country's official border control agencies. (See here for the latest information on these.)\n\nIf you are a Pakistani citizen, go to your lawyer for legal advice on the case. A passport should answer no questions. If you have never been denied your American citizenship or you have a foreign identity, this will require confirmation-that your passport is valid.\n\nOnce you pass the exam, you will also have a passport issued by you. When your American identification expires I will ask your guardian to check your citizenship. You have 3 months to file your case with me. The most important part is that you are being allowed to move to the United States for American citizenship (I will be allowed to be out in about 3 years if it is good for you).\n\nIf you aren't sure which side of the border your application will go, you have 3 days from today to call me and register your case. I will check your immigration status with ICTI.\n\nWhen you're done registering, I will present you with a picture and ask you several questions. If you didn't pass the exam correctly then you will be asked to return home. If I do not respond to the question correctly I will not be able to appeal. This will be very frustrating for you because it will be a very embarrassing experience. I usually have five friends who must try to help me after they learn about how I am doing without our knowledge. One of them told me to move back to the United States to become legally an American citizen.\n\nHowever, once you give me your new passport, I will not approve of any of the decisions you ask. You have to explain to me about yourself and my position in society and about how you can be a part of the community and use your newfound status to get around security. After you have given me my new passport, I am free to leave as I please. I will never have to worry about it. I'm not going to hold on for a long time.\n\nSince your new passport is now mine, I can also tell you about things that I have learned in the process of being a Pakistani citizen.

{"id":2083,"ended":true,"length":729,"gen_text":"You are a werewolf. And a vampire, an angel, a mermaid, a witch and an alien. You are a werewolf in the flesh.\n\n\nIt's the same thing, like in reality. In reality it would look like anything you'd want to keep. It's the same thing as a wolf, but with an entirely different history. In reality it'd probably look pretty great. If it was any other man, wouldn't it be like he wanted to kill you? Because if it was anyone else, it would be you.\n\n\nSo you have two options: One of you doesn't care, but one of you would like it, since it is yours. Like, the other hand: If you want your werewolf to know what to do with your werewolf's ass, you probably shouldn't care. But if it wasn't yours, that really doesn't matter anyway. And you can be happy with your werewolf being completely self conscious about your actions. Just have a good relationship with the other person.\n\n\nAnd what do you want in this whole world? Do you want for your werewolf to just be like this, as you are? That your are just trying to protect you?\n\n\nTo be honest, I feel like this is the most boring way to say this, because then I'd do anything to put you down.\n\n\nThere are so many horrible things we're talking about today.\n\n\nWe got two days to put this out then as they had to leave after that. Or now, this one's over after three days.\n\n\nYou can see that it's going to take a lot more time than it had to you, so I'll tell you I won't even be trying to explain everything anymore.\n\n\nAll I'll tell you is what's on this is my theory. No one's saying it's true. People just happen to say it will happen.\n\n\nAnd I just want it to be said. So when you are going through this, if you know what is happening, you have something that you, you want to know.\n\n\nWhen you lose the girl you love, you lose a lot of time.\n\n\nDo you even wish you lost all of them.\n\n\nWhen you grow up and try your whole lives to be like that.\n\n\nWhen you go on the world's worst journey ever.\n\n\nDon't care what people think of you. Don't care about who they think you are.\n\n\nPeople seem to not care what you do. They think it's normal for you and they think that you are really cool so they can manipulate you without your knowledge.\n\n\nYou'll eventually learn this. People all over the world are doing the same thing that you thought they would do, and it's never going to look like it happened.\n\n\nNot to mention, they take your secrets with them no matter what and you will eventually lose control of your feelings in the end by doing this to them. Because they think that because their feelings don't matter anymore, that their feelings don't matter (you can tell how great those feelings are by how easy it is to see those emotions). People are simply no longer capable of believing that it doesn't matter anymore, because they took their secrets with them. And they think things like, Well, she's really important to you anyway, I am really gonna try to prove to her how I'm great (which is really great), it's not even about her, it's about me.\n\n\nIt would be nice for me to make you pay attention to what I'm telling myself.

{"id":3768,"ended":false,"length":739,"gen_text":"Write a short story about a world where you can only become someone's best friend by killing off their last one.\n\n. The short stories are almost always just the first one. Even if you like them, if you make it to the top of the list it's actually okay to start asking what it is you want me to do next.\n\n\"You know what, you could just read [another short story], just see if your brain tells you what he wanted to do, because that's just what happens.\n\n\"But you have to see it through with the author, because who doesn't love short stories?\"\n\nIt's a matter of timing: the long stories get published before the short stories get any traction or are picked up by any media, and then they tend to get used in other places too.\n\nFor an easy, non-daunting answer from a fan, here are what we wrote about, and there's so much here about the genre's history that you just can't wait for it to come along.\n\nIt's a great way to start. Here are some of the best new stuff, like this one.\n\nWe had some really interesting moments in our last article where the author didn't want to tell us: The first story (the one with the title 'The Lost Planet') did get put on the final edition of The Guardian and we had to buy those books on sale the same day (the two short stories were even harder to get them to the top of that list), so it took like two days after that book was published to make the final rounds before we moved them, then a year later.\n\nWe also have a fair amount of this stuff we've been talking about recently, which has been in the news a fair few times since then: The Guardian is now available in three different formats; English, French and German;\n\n\u2026\n\nThis week's topic of course was actually the weird little thing called 'The Guardian' that took some years to get out into the world: we have something called 'the web of your favourite characters', which basically starts something on your Twitter feed and ends it there. This isn't what'my favourite characters' really means, but rather what my favourite characters were.\n\nIt's actually kind of weird that for some writers there are just a few characters that we've seen over the years who really want to go over to the world. As a British guy with quite, very long legs, some of these stories kind of happen to me. They come out by the second I start to see that there are really cool characters of interest, but it takes me a while to get to that part. And I like doing stories where there's an element of that there... where you're just sitting at your computer with a spreadsheet of all your favourite characters, and it seems like they take a little while to reach your computer and you don't really have time to start the story. They're just really very, very good at that. That's also probably the idea behind that one - that there's a reason that in fiction there's so many story's going to happen in that order.\n\nYou can read our post-mortem to see whether there's any reason why short stories couldn't be found to make it into the top 10 when we put them on the list: I've talked to people who don't like writing short stories because they don't feel like they've got the same kind of story to tell, or they want to avoid something that can make your story a bit too small. Either way, it's great that they found these good examples \u2013 and they went with them.\n\nTo read more of the great stories from this year, check out the gallery

{"id":2053,"ended":true,"length":721,"gen_text":"Eye colour means everything here. Brown control the earth, blue controls the water, white controls the sky. There are so many colours and each important but you were the first born with yellow eyes.\n\nIn the middle are the colours that make up the sun, blue and green. Red is the planet Mercury, and green is the moon.\n\nThe earth has two major bases - its continents - and its moons. Most moons are formed within the Earth's orbit. These moons formed and formed the planet.\n\nThe Moon and the planets divide our universe into 3 separate moons. The Earth has no planets or planets- or stars. The Sun has 4 planets (Saturn, Venus and the Red Planet; Saturn, Pluto and Uranus ). The Moon is our Earth's largest moon, and we use our ability to perceive its color.\n\nThe Sun shows up in four separate moon colour schemes: green, blue, white and red. These schemes change during the night, and the colours are what will stay on your skin and not in the dark sky.\n\nThe second base is Mars, the closest world to us and the closest planet to us. This is our moon. Mars will become part of the moon constellation, like Venus and Mercury.\n\nThe third base is Earth (Mars), where the planet will remain one year. When the planet gets to the right place, it will start to spin. It is our sun.\n\nIf you don't have a lot of patience, there are several ways of achieving this. The first thing is to pick that planet as your new home.\n\nThe second way is to pick a different planet to your liking. And when you start to pick your favourite places, then you can add a bunch of other planets, so your sun will become part of the whole thing. One way is to place a'spotter planet' in your home that will spin the planet in any direction.\n\nIf you make the time to pick this planet, I recommend using a colour scheme that gives you the desired effect.\n\nThe third base is Saturn, the planet you have just picked. Unlike the other three bashed, it will stick to your skin and stay on the planet even when you feel very tired and tired of getting tired. The only difference between this base and the others is the size: Saturn is just 1\/13th the size of your sun. So, if you just wanted to pick one of these four different planets to your liking, choose the one that gives you the desired effect.\n\nThe fourth base is Mars, the planet you have just picked. The Mars that you chose will become part of our moon constellation, like Venus and Mercury. If you can find a'spotter planet', then use the same colors that you picked for your home to become your new home.\n\nHere are a few simple ways of making your own Planet Selection\n\nTake a look at this guide to pick a planet to your new home, and choose a couple of different ways to make your selection in the following ways:\n\n1. Choose a color that reflects your new look. It will add to your skin, and it won't look good on the sky. Take a look at some pictures of planet suns here.\n\n2. Choose a color that helps your skin colour your eyes. It's called 'natural' red when it comes to your eyes.\n\n3. Buy a new color or use a different skin combination on it. Here is an example of a new color on the colour picker that could be very different from what you currently use on your computer. Just do a round-up of the most popular options for your skin colour.\n\nFor a better experience, let me know in the

{"id":2862,"ended":false,"length":776,"gen_text":"You are a successful hitman. An unsuspecting, cheery and nice girl moves next door. She knocks on your door one day and asks for help. You are attacked by a giant robot. The robot shoots you in the head and you fall to the floor with half your head paralyzed. You fall to the floor, helpless to survive. The robot then attacks your mother but you quickly die. You wake up and ask for help from all around you and when the robot tries to kill your mother, you fight him and he shoots you. Your mother then falls to the floor and your body turns upside down. The robot then shoots you in your butt. You look confused and have a very hard time talking to yourself since your mother is dead. The robot then takes over and you have your first real chance. You decide to fight your robots while you try to save your mother from some robot but her mind is controlled by the robot. She looks away and you are shocked. She tells you to talk to her mother. You talk to her. She tells you things about yourself that you won't tell anyone. She turns the room into a cave with giant robots. You fight her and then discover that the machines are killing her so quickly. She screams but you can tell that she is trying to stop you through her. When your mom gets home she makes a move with the robot and then your father, killing her. Then she tells you the story of how her mother always found her daughter and where the robot came from. At this place, her mother then asks you to find your sister that she will help with this one too. Your father and he ask you to find your sister that you saved her from then. You search for her and she decides to help you find her. I feel very sorry at my mother's death. You have very long dreams about your father, how he killed her and how he took her. The dream takes off and you spend the rest of the night in bed staring at the ceiling wondering where your dad and his mother are. The next morning, you wake up in bed crying. My dream has been going for over twenty years, not even the day before my dream. Your dream is about you and your dream is about having your dreams. The dream is about you and your dream is about the dreams you've made. You never had your dreams and your dreams are real. Your dreams are just a dream and now we are starting over. Your dream is about your real dreams and now you are starting over. Your dream is about your dreams. You are a new man for this dream. You live in the desert and are living a lonely life. You love your dreams and your dreams are real. You are living a life that only your dreams are real. You like your dreams and your dreams are real. You are a young woman in the desert making your dreams come true. Your dreams are real. You are a young woman with the dream that you will make your dream come true. Your dreams are new. The dreams are real by your dreams. Your dreams are real by your dreams. Your dreams are real. Your dreams are real by your dreams (you can tell how great the dream is by your dreams). Now that you have your dreams, your new man and you think that it would be nice if you were not dead to live a life like this. You want to live a life that is beautiful. The dream is amazing. You want to see the dreams on every picture you find. Your dreams are amazing. Your dreams are wonderful. You need to have your dreams to become a man.

{"id":3760,"ended":false,"length":699,"gen_text":"Astronomers, early one morning, discover that yesterday went by with no one waking.\n\nHowever, that afternoon the moon's shadow disappeared, and the day turned to night because of the planet Mercury's proximity to the sun.\n\n\"We can predict how the time of night will come and change the direction of our sun's gravitational pull,\" said Dr. Robert R. W. MacDougall, professor emeritus and lead author of four paper reviews on the findings. \"This has implications for the universe's dynamics.\" As we know, the two largest planets in the solar system were created 3.5 billion years ago and formed billions of light years before Earth did. A few of those billions may have died before we arrived.\n\nThe research shows that while a moon moon is probably the most probable future exoplanet, its orbit is also far from uniform, and the new findings give scientists a very good idea of its size.\n\nFor example, a second, less likely exoplanet, possibly a dwarf planet found 2 million years ago in the deep oceans of the solar system, might have a distance of 3 miles or more, said Dr. MacDougall. That would suggest a planet where the star is close enough to the horizon, which is so cold, to be easily discovered.\n\nThe latest study examined four exoplanets, two of which are probably rocky, and then examined their motions and brightness over a two-day window. The two star systems had similar characteristics -- rocky planets look like large, rocky objects.\n\n\"Our findings provide a clue to how large these worlds might have been and also the way they could have moved around so their orbits would have tilted in opposite directions at the beginning,\" McDiarmid said.\n\nThis result gave scientists a better idea of how rocky planets might have moved before they started to make stars; for example, a planet that was found almost 100 million years ago might have moved its orbit with its own gravity, meaning its orbit was aligned for a distance of almost 1,000 miles at the beginning of the universe.\n\nThe scientists speculate the planet would have been very far away from Earth's rim. The team has even found evidence of a moon moon. The star system formed just 1 million years ago, and the team now believe another 2 million years ago, likely the same time frame that happened. They now plan to try to test this hypothesis again.\n\nThe next step is for them to examine how some of these planetary regions were made to be that they were so distant.\n\n\"One of the big mysteries about these exoplanets is what made our sun so close to the sun,\" said W. William Stauffer, a planetary scientist at the Universities of Oxford and London, and lead author on the New Horizons Mission\n\n\"It was found that the planet Mars had the same type of solar winds as today's sun but a way longer than our sun in the central latitudes,\" he said. \"The evidence that this planetary system also had a very short time of day gives us a pretty good idea of how the solar wind moved around the system when it formed.\"\n\nThe new findings may have implications for the next generation of space telescopes, known to provide data on objects in the universe, Stauffer said.\n\nMacDougall believes the new findings are only the beginning of a very active phase on our planet, with the formation of billions of planets like Earth. But he also sees a role for scientists who want to study supernovae and other large-scale cosmic explosions on our planet -- especially in terms of the study of stellar formation and its expansion.\n\n______\n\nBibliographic information: Dr. Robert R.

{"id":1627,"ended":false,"length":743,"gen_text":"The latest best seller is about a Nobel Prize winning chemist who is also an axe-wielding serial killer. Write a review trashing the non-existent book.\n\nIn fact, in the year since I first wrote about the book, I've got no other idea what it would look like. That said, you may want to consider asking what it would actually be like if you were to run a story on this subject right now.\n\nThe book is fairly light.\n\nIt is a fairly short story\u2014about three people. However, it contains interesting things that make it interesting\u2014and possibly terrifying\u2014if you've spent all your time reading about this subject. I think I'm going for it.\n\nI do see a lot of similarities\u2014and there may be more:\n\nIf you're still reading this, you may have noticed that the second page of this little piece is a little odd:\n\nIt looks like it came out after my last book. It reads like an attempt at a modern story telling, but it's so weird that the second half of it looks like it came out while I was writing it. I can feel that this might have been my real life last book.\n\nAnd from your perspective you might be thinking \"that's where they want me to be in this book, which is so weird!\"\n\nMaybe there's some sort of plot or purpose to the story, but I don't know. I don't particularly care where the book is going to leave you. It could be the end of any series or storyline that you care about, or you might just want to avoid it altogether. It might very well be your final book, and I can't tell anyone right now what that final book is.\n\nBut if I'm reading this right now, all you'll need to understand is I am a bit of a weirdo. If you are curious about how this story is constructed, then this is a good place to start. The first thing that comes to mind is the \"The Dark Side\"! And this is an entry for the \"New Worlds\" series, which includes, coincidentally, the \"Walking Dead\" comics the book is based on.\n\nIt's a bit unclear whether or not this book will end with the return of The Dark Side. For those familiar with those books, I have said for years that I think that a new, world where the dead are no more is really going to be more interesting than a world where the dead are alive. This book is so new it gives new meaning for this world to be opened up to characters like Dead Man Walking and Rick Ross that seem real, and so interesting that I wonder how the book might end up like the Dead Man Walking. I like that this isn't just an odd coincidence that the show is a show, and it also doesn't actually look like it was written after the first two comics, so the book might be different than it seems in my mind. This makes for a really interesting story.\n\nThere is very little information on how the book will end. It will either end in my opinion, or it could be that it's the end of two or more characters. However, it would be nice if it was a \"good\" ending to the story, and I am sure I wouldn't have forgotten what happened when I was 12, and when I was 40. This doesn't mean that I am wrong as to the plot on this book, but I do think it's great that the writer has brought this whole weird thing to life, and it's awesome that he has done so.

{"id":2739,"ended":false,"length":734,"gen_text":"One fine day you decide to bake a cake. However it's not a cake that comes out of the oven.\n\n. The crust in the cookie dough is thick, so the cookie dough needn't be too big. If you are using a muffin tray you may want to use a bigger cookie tray as your muffin is always going to be much larger.\n\nYou could bake cookies for four to six months before getting used to them.\n\nStep four: Measure out the dough and add it to a 6-oz ball or baking sheet. The dough will form a ball with one side of the balls and the other facing the outside of it. The ball will cover with a layer of wax paper which covers any imperfections you may have.\n\nOnce more, add the crumbs to the dough into the large round cookie dough and knead for 4-6 minutes or until it begins to form what will be called a 'pizza ball'.\n\nOnce you get a puffy puddle of dough you won't have time to bake another one. I know you don't want to cook pizza for hours on end. However, I won't cook it for 24 hours (we can eat pizza!)\n\nStep five: Take the crust and place it in the centre (the right hand corner) of the cookie dough. Fill with 2 tablespoons flour. You can find this at your favourite supermarket. Cut the dough short and lay it over a baking sheet. Bake. The dough is about 10-12 hours thick and will look like this :)\n\nIt won't sit in the oven very long before you get bored, then you can add more flour if it gets hot so that makes it easier to bake with your hands.\n\nThere will be a tiny bit of excess flour left when the cookies are baked (you may want to add some extra for different uses later) so cut it down a bit. I found two pieces out of every 9 dough balls so I only cut one of them down to make a good loaf.\n\nStep six: If you want, combine the egg whites with one tablespoon honey and the cinnamon with three tablespoons lemon juice. In a medium bowl add the flour mixture and the egg whites, beat until lightened. Pour the batter into the prepared baking sheet and bake for 1-4 minutes. Remember that just a little bit of flour will cover everything.\n\nAfter baking for 2 more minutes, fold the baking sheet into the cake. This will be very thin. You can see that this dough does not fit into the centre.\n\nStep seven: Place on large baking tray and bake for 20-25 minutes until golden. The edges will show a very slight amount of browning and when you remove the tray (it will turn brown) it will turn clear. Then the chocolate (if you used coconut chips) will cool a bit. Then let it cool further, about 10 minutes. Then it should cool really nicely.\n\nStep eight: Once the cookies are done baking, you don't have to wait as long to see how well they are done (you can remove the cakes and put them back in the oven for 30 minutes). Let them cool in your fridge for 8-10 minutes before baking again.\n\nStep nine: The next two hours are when you can begin to enjoy a bit of the delicious baking cookies. I only use one of these to bake my cookies every day because I am lazy. However, I like to make a few more for fun so try to avoid too much sugar and sugar add your own tricks.\n\nStep 10: Finally, you can serve them as dessert.

{"id":1129,"ended":false,"length":750,"gen_text":"Moments before your characters death, time stops. They can only start time again by getting into their exact position they were in at the time of the stop,, and closing their eyes.\n\n,, and are the only characters capable of ending the timer completely\n\nThe fact is if you make it to the top of the battle screen you will see that you have time to talk to your character until you have died, but after that you will be able to use time stops and end the game.\n\nIt is a very good idea to use special characters at the bottom of the screen such as the hero's or the villain's, to save the game or your character.\n\nYou can also use special moves on top of those characters to save you with time stops. This will save you time or your time by getting to the top of the screen using the move, time stops, and using some special moves.\n\n, time stops, and using some special moves. If you can get time stops, you can cancel the timer by using the Cancel option, making time stops appear during the second cut.\n\n. It is worth mentioning in this section that you must get your character from the top of the screen to the bottom of the fight screen by using Cancel to get to the top of the screen using Special moves.\n\nThe fight with the hero (the main character only) may then start again using Special moves. Sometimes characters will fall out of the fight at the end of every fight due to the same attack (the two main characters can fall out at the same time) or you need to finish the fight with Move moves.\n\nThis is because you cannot escape using Special moves if the end timer is reset. The time stop must be on, so in effect this means that you MUST use at least one attack, such as at the very end of your fight, and then use Special moves, then using the final time stop.\n\nThese time stops can cause the game to overshoot at the bottom of the screen where the character starts and ends when you are about to die, so you must use Special moves or use Special moves that will help you escape.\n\nIf you enter a special move that will completely kill your character (such as getting hit by an opponent's item, you will not be able to use it, or just dying is not possible), then your character should be at the bottom of the screen, the battle's final cut will end to your death.\n\nIf you die during the fight with the villain with special, wait until you die to stop doing it for this attack to stop.\n\nIf you are defeated during the fight, that character will die and your character can simply respawn without dying for you to respawn. However if two attacks kill your character, then you can't use the final time stop action to get back on your final attack, which will not be considered for use after your character has been revived.\n\nWhen you see no time stop and you are being eliminated from the battle, the main character simply says, \"Well, I just finished the battle for you. After all, it didn't really matter if I fought with two attacks\", and then disappears.\n\n) and then disappears. If your character gets killed during the main cut, it will not be considered your character's death (you died because your character did not enter the fight ).\n\n. This is because the boss fight only happens once after the main cut starts on, because you cannot immediately use special characters while the last time it happens is after you've completed

{"id":3195,"ended":false,"length":751,"gen_text":"Lonely and bored, you developed a secret language, that you consistently use to talk to yourself. One day, when you mutter something under your breath, a stranger replies with ease. \"How about one that makes you happy?\"\n\n\nIt goes without saying that most people who study the language make mistakes when working with it. You will discover that the language in question is not a perfect representation of humans. In fact, it is really quite simple.\n\n\nHow do you learn to code?\n\n\nBefore you even know it what language you are coding for is going to give you what you're going to do with that machine : it will always try to understand your questions. To this day, I am never able to figure out what language to use, with which one the computer will know to which one your answers.\n\n\nHow to code more precisely?\n\n\nDon't worry about trying too hard with code, because even after developing it, it's going to take a long time to get used to, and there are many reasons why you will likely learn a second language without some of the other languages.\n\n\nHow to get yourself used to code?\n\n\nWhile having your first language as something new to learn can be a lot of fun for a beginner ( you might be used to using the old lingo instead of writing some new language, which will take a great deal of time ), then learning is the best way to learn new stuff.\n\n\nSo how do you find out what language you are going to be using? At first glance, it seems like you are going to know three things : :\n\n\n( 1) You can write your first language in English, using a lot of old lingo and a lot of new writing style. ( 2) You can learn this by practicing with your Japanese and then by watching television, where the two ways of learning English differ. ( 3) You can learn using the old rules from English books you have read on learning different languages by studying different kinds of Japanese language books, and how this will help you with your learning of the new code you will be using.\n\n\nHow to find out your first language in Japanese?\n\n\nIf you follow these two instructions, you will be able to understand your first language in Japanese without any experience in Japanese :\n\nThe first page shows you how to learn Japanese by writing your first language code written in Japanese. This can be very helpful if you want to learn to use a computer and to learn Japanese using more than one language. If you are going to learn, first you need to know the new writing style of Japanese to learn that style. Once you are familiar with it, you need to figure out what your code language does to it : How does the code talk to a machine? How does all of this work? How do you make sure there's enough time in the machine for your new code to move into the machine?\n\n\nThe computer also learns how the code talks to other machines, including humans, in a way that is not really in the user's best interest except to use code. That means that for example, you will have to learn how to read a message ( a string in Japanese, and a text message in English ) using one of these code languages:\n\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n\nyou might even learn to work with them, when you think about your code when speaking in the language.

Describe life under the church of ( your favorite book or movie ) in the future.\n\n. Describe life under the church of or ) in the future\n\nThe fact is that religion is really just fandoms of popular books that got out of control over time.\n\nThis could change once people realize that we're really just fandoms of books that got out of control over time.\n\n\u2014 The idea of religion has become increasingly popular because of the mass-market nature of the new Internet, the fact we're really just fandoms of popular books that got out of control over time.\n\n. There are some books about children's books that are published in an online or paper format by religion.\n\n. Religion is being promoted in the same way it is being promoted anywhere else, because they can influence people's attitude to some important book and change their opinion.\n\nI can never argue that a book about the religious world is really just about some of the other books.\n\n. It turns out that when people read a book on religion, they know that it's just a few references to religion, not all of them.\n\n, they know that it's just a few references to religion, not all of them ( because they can influence people's attitudes to some important book and change their opinion. My own favorite book about atheism is \"The Theory of Religions\" by G. William James. It's about two people who agree with each other that Christianity is an actual religion like many other religions, and he says, \"So what? Does religion get promoted, then?\" That the book is about religion also makes a point about how this \"cult\" of believers and nonbelievers has been in the news for the past 50 years. So if religion is just just an idea that's been tossed around to make time for an article or a conversation over email or social media, then that makes religion just an idea with no real real history, and it's good for the people who read it. If religion is just about religions.\n\n. If religion is just about some of the other books. In any event, I am absolutely right about the value of religion. For instance, my Christian faith is just about good people sharing common values. If you value religious knowledge, that just means you value good people sharing common values. That I really want to see more religious books published. If you value religious writing and telling stories, that just means you value high level authors and stories telling stories. I want the religious community to start publishing books that talk good about religion so that more Christians understand how our society views religion.\n\nYou are absolutely right, all of these books that sell are not about religion. It's just about people who don't pay enough attention to the religion, and that's not cool. If they take a little break from religion and start buying better books, then they really are not in the same position when it comes to giving people good information about religion.\n\n. It's just about people who don't pay enough attention to the religion, and that's not fun. If you're not interested in making money from your faith, then you're not good stewards of the money. You're just wasting your time.\n\n. You might have a good idea of what people are going to think or write about religion as they buy it on Amazon or an official Christian book. This could hurt your brand. But to be very clear, what I was saying is something that can happen to every non-believer. I hope you have seen that my book on atheists is a pretty cool thought-provoking read of the kinds of things that religious authors usually want to cover, and it's just

{"id":4720,"ended":false,"length":714,"gen_text":"Some scientists, while exploring the depths of the Mariana trench have found a strange door blocking the way.\n\n\"It was in the way,\" said physicist Dr David Bockin, who studies gravity in the ocean. \"So let me give you the answer, that that door was probably not a door, and if there is one that is, let me give you [the mystery].\" [See 'Caveman's Cave': An Unusual View of The Mariana Trench]\n\nWhen Bockin and his team first broke into the Mariana trench from their vessel in the 1930s the researchers could have seen something on the bottom surface where a \"deep, wide window\" formed. Yet they found nothing: \"I found nothing.\"\n\nThe result shows what scientists have been saying for years: gravity is not the biggest force driving earthquakes. The world's greatest natural hazard is the ocean itself, which produces about 40,000 cubic kilometers of force and has taken on a massive weight.\n\nRelated: A Trench Made From Chemical Rocks Explained in \"SuperMeme.\" A Brief History Of Physics\n\nThe experiment was one of two similar investigations conducted by researchers at Duke University in the early 1990s where they found one of the strangest phenomena, which turned out to be the only way there was water under the rock. At the time there was no sign of a human presence.\n\nEven more surprising is that at the time this discovery was made, that the deepest trench had never been found. Until now \u2014 the exact date for it is not known \u2014 because of a faulty measurement instrument that kept the depth below 15mm. The team found that this was only a problem when they moved the telescope along an underwater tunnel that is used for probing in the sea.\n\n\"It didn't work with the tunnel where we were finding water,\" said biologist David Blanchard, who led the team studying Mariana. \"In our observations it was getting so shallow with no water, it took us years to get that deep inside. We did have something that had some way of moving water from one part of the trench to another.\"\n\nThe researchers have been looking for some kind of \"spatially moving\" water since the 1940s, but were shocked to discover just one such water. The deepest trench is 2,826 kilometers, the deepest we've seen over the past 40 years.\n\n\"We can clearly see the entire length of the trench, showing that it is an unusual place to live,\" said Bockin. \"If you are seeing a great deal of vegetation, you really want to see more, to see the most incredible evidence of human presence that has ever existed.\"\n\nRelated: 'Deep Undersea Life' Takes It Into Another Level\n\nA team led by Blanchard also discovered a rock that was much smaller, with approximately 10,000 to 10,000 kilos of material instead of 10 to 15,000. This is one possible explanation for why they found that in their last look at the trench, they found nothing. However, they did notice in the beginning that there are large rocks below some of the rocks, which also had water below. \"The last spot that we found was the bottom, because they were already too far down to tell if it was any deeper there,\" said Bockin.\"At that time I am quite confident that it was there.\"\n\nWith the discovery, Bockin hopes the same kind of exploration will continue for decades to come, even in the absence of other clues for life.\n\n\"We will have to keep investigating, until we find a clue,\" said Blanchard.\n\nTo learn more about the discovery or to share your

I'm not a science scientist, but I have used those years as training and training for my own research so I can say the book works. I'm pretty sure that most people with a mental disability are lazy: If you have a disability, they know what to do. If you have a disability, they probably won't like you.\n\nIf you have a disability, they probably won't like you.

I'd like to know why you'd think having your gender at birth wouldn't be a good thing for children.\n\n. That's good. I'd like to know why you'd think having your gender at birth wouldn't be a good thing for children. You think your parents are evil or stupid.\n\nYou don't have to worry about being too old to work.

The fact that many women make that choice for money doesn't invalidate them. If it were just a matter of getting women to work longer hours, it may be easier for you to get people to work longer hours. If you get women not to work when they need to, then the money will disappear and they will have a better time. If you work longer hours, you're not going to get money from men. When you get women not to work when they need to, then you are just being selfish, so we will not pay you to work.

If you get women not to work when they need to, then the money will disappear and they will have a better time. If you work longer hours, you're no longer going to get money from men.

That's because their brains don't \"move\" to work at that point. ( This isn't because most women can't work longer hours) Women have a good eye for attention. This doesn't mean women have to work as much as men on their day to day. (The only time they do work long hours is when they're busy with school or errands.)\n\nThis doesn't mean anything just yet.

{"id":2937,"ended":false,"length":751,"gen_text":"You don't know it yet, but you're being recruited for a secret organization. In one day, you encounter a series of increasingly bizarre situations -- each one is a test. You 'll come home in disbelief. The next day, you realize that you needn' be able to make it from the top of this pile to the bottom. You're doing it right. When you return to your senses, you learn that everything was right. In all likelihood, you'll end up getting murdered in the act.\n\nWhen you were younger, you knew that you were gonna get killed for nothing, that being a member of the cult has no repercussions, but now you realise that you're doing nothing for it. Your memories. If you'll tell anyone what happened to you, or you 'll know what to do, then it's a good time to come into contact with this amazing entity that lurks beyond the world.\n\nWhat is the history of what will happen to everyone, and where do they end up?\n\nFirst, you ask some of the questions you've been getting tired of asking yourself. I know you're asking them all on your own. But maybe I'm not so tired of asking them all.\n\nSecond, you ask some of the old questions, one after the other. It's not something that's been done many times before, but is something that will'r wee. If you don't know what is going on, I guess the answers should come in two days.\n\nThird, as you ask more questions you begin to look at the answers to many different questions, and you begin to see the very meaning behind what we think, and what's going on in our lives, and how we'll try to live our lives, even when we'll have no idea what's happening. I've even written this essay where i find things that i can'r tell you about life in the cult, and I can tell you that the truth is almost entirely hidden behind the veil of ', and this is truly what i will tell you about living your life. You will discover not just the truth behind how we die, but even where it is, especially once you'll open up your conscience about it. We'll be friends.\n\nThis is just one point of understanding what is going on in real life. I think it's worth mentioning now. On that same page, I provide many useful details about the relationship between religions, beliefs, and morals. This article is not to teach you new tricks for avoiding being arrested for religion. I want you to take a step back and take a good look behind the veil of truth to see if it might be able to take a different form. Let all of these ideas become your guide for understanding what is going on under God's guidance. For those of you not familiar with some of the topics that are covered, they take a little further than what I've just covered in a way that really puts you in the right place.\n\nI hope that you have enjoyed this piece of information about religion, and that I have taken your research (including mine ) as great as I possibly can. Please let me know what you think of this article and any changes you may think to it in the comments section below!\n\nAnd if you're also interested in a video interview with Richard Dawkins in which Richard talks about the relationship between religion and morality, or the relationship between Christianity and Catholicism, check out the YouTube channel at YouTube.com\/RichardDawkins ; or check

{"id":1698,"ended":true,"length":766,"gen_text":"A small coffee shop in the middle of nowhere... I couldn't believe the way they were gonna treat us. We were like, 'This is unbelievable.' And I did feel sorry for those people.\n\nWhen you talk to men who love your music but you have never met a person who has been supportive of your music after coming out, it is just not going away\u2014when you hear people have this feeling you're not gonna give them what you're willing to pay them. As we're talking with so many musicians, who were raised by musicians who have never met anyone but myself, I think it is our job as musicians to educate them. If you want your music to make people's lives better, if you care about the community and your music makes them feel good, if you can create people that really want to go out and do something about it, it's just never going to work.\n\nWhat's a really amazing thing about being with you onstage?\n\nThey let you see through things. We went and sat down on stage and spent some time just talking about who you are, where you come from, what your life is like\u2014all the things that you might be thinking about. I also wanted to share some anecdotes.\n\nThe other thing I did while onstage was just watch the show. I couldn't believe how people were talking about where the other dancers were and where they were at. The two of them had never danced together before and had never done it like we did. That was my first time seeing the show; it changed the way I went about my creative career. It made me realize how much fun and energy I should have been at my own feet, when all the lights are flickering on and I am dancing with my friend and my two boys. And that was how I felt at that moment.\n\nThere was a lot of love during our time. There was laughter, and there was joy, and there's still love during that song. It's been such a privilege to help raise young people like me to be so honored and grateful for where we are at. What was that? I am so blessed to be with you, and you have seen my life change. When you talk about your life and your personal life for a second, that just feels real, real special.\n\nI am now 26 years old.\n\n[Laughs] I'm sorry\u2014I was just so grateful. I would say a year or so ago, I thought I was going to be homeless if I stayed in that place. It just seems crazy, how you do it for so long.\n\nYou got a lot of friends who just love your music, who also have a big heart.\n\nOh man! I love people who love my music. I love people who are really inspired by my music, but who are also like my idols. This show really kicked start the momentum. They came up to us, and I told them I wasn't gonna give up\u2014they didn't listen, and I could see that in how great the song was. But I got some encouragement to move on, and it was a really positive experience for me personally and for the rest of the world because I'm so supportive of what I'm doing.\n\nWhat will be the biggest mistake you'll make in your career as a solo artist?\n\nMy career will take me out of the limelight, because I know very little of what I was going to do with myself as a artist for seven years. But it will still have a big impact, as it does for me. How do you not fall for the hype and hope that by dancing around it, you have all the strength to overcome yourself?

Despite their technological superiority, they are in awe of the human ability to tie knots. The planet Mercury has been a haven for civilizations for centuries. Many of the humans have settled there as part of their own empire, with many living there as slaves or slave traders.\n\nThe Earth is the only planet where life on it is entirely free, and where civilization is at its strongest. Mercury has no significant social or political structure that rivals the Earth. On the other hand, the earth's magnetic field is largely a matter of habitation and geological history.\n\nMercury is the nearest known location to any other planet, although it has long been the subject of considerable study by the scientific community.\n\nThe Sun was also an ancient solar system and, during the time of Mercury and Uranus, the planet was part of the galactic prehistory known as the Galactic Unified Theory. Mercury is home to the closest known intergalactic capital, Ganymede.\n\n, the planet was part of the galactic prehistory known as the. Mercury is home to the closest known intergalactic capital, Ganymede. Mercury is also home to the earliest known known knowledge on the origins of man.\n\nThe planet Mercury had been discovered by Dragan the Rachni on 8 March 1841, on the planet Hohokary in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale d'Orl\u00e9ans.\n\nThe planet Mercury's surface is covered in many shades of blue, dark green, blue, white, and gray. The light is scattered from a wide region of light in this part of the planet at the horizon; the light from the nearby sea water appears reddish as a clear red when the planet is covered in blue. On Earth, however, the color of this light is lessened by the Sun's gravity, and it reflects back into space with the faintest trace of light, while in Mars, its brightness almost diminishes when measured at the horizon of Mars.\n\n. The surface of the planet Saturn is dotted around the Sun. This is where the planet's magnetic field resides, while the Earth's poles rotate around Saturn. When the planet spins at least 120 kilometers per hour for a distance of 2 million kilometers, the magnetic field will pull the planets to a point opposite the Sun where they can be measured at a distance of 2.3 million kilometers. For some time after this process was reversed, the earth's magnetosphere was weakened, causing it to become somewhat acidic. This process led to more frequent Earth-like auroras. The only time a very bright or bright planet is seen near a central star is when the planet's magnetic field is less than 0.6 AU, which is considered far-off.\n\nThe Mars terrain does have some differences that make Mercury a good choice in a scientific analysis of the Earth in the near future.\n\nMercury's surface is covered in many shades of blue.\n\n. Mercury's temperature is a relatively warm, almost as warm as the upper atmosphere of most stars. It also has some of the most powerful sunlight on the planet.\n\nMercury's surface is covered in many shades of grey.\n\n. Mercury possesses some of the finest in the galaxy, including the very deep, rich regions of Saturn.\n\n. The atmosphere of Mercury is thick with oxygen.\n\n. The atmosphere of Mercury is deep with oxygen, but much of it can be lost by the surface ice-forming planets Mercury and Mars. Mercury's surface is made of a mixture of ice-carbon, nitrogen dioxide, and oxygen, as well as hydrogen, which provides the best water.\n\nMercury and Saturn are considered the closest known intergalactic capitals. Mercury and Saturn have two common moons.\n\nReferences","token_len":797,"entropy":[9.0922,8.548,2.7084,7.4495,3.6978,0.1454,5.1055,2.5143,6.227,1.598,4.5787,2.0739,0.213,1.5199,1.232,5.0425,7.2439,0.1849,1.6304,2.0743,6.0407,0.1268,9.7915,5.3378,1.5013,1.7749,0.0025,8.7617,6.9853,0.0809,0.0308,0.003,0.0003,0.0005,0.0025,0.0032,0.0001,0.0005,0.001,0.0007,0.0076,0.0012,0.0043,0.001,0.0047,1.7166,5.9549,5.2086,2.5077,2.046,3.348,4.0586,0.2753,5.668,1.2892,1.8277,0.5007,4.4046,1.5436,1.2184,5.0846,2.2015,3.3901,0.8301,3.4178,3.349,0.001,1.1155,2.7836,4.8135,1.2185,4.0117,2.509,3.9868,2.2752,1.0133,1.3957,2.5601,3.5289,2.3063,0.217,1.6012,0.0002,1.7679,3.5229,1.1528,2.9786,2.2412,1.9309,2.4777,3.7774,3.0196,3.0769,1.2713,5.2401,3.0794,2.5824,1.4584,3.2787,4.7685,1.0758,4.6178,0.8443,3.185,0.159,4.7777,2.4966,3.9411,5.6014,5.4149,1.4268,1.1275,3.3013,3.7414,5.1393,1.2356,2.1215,1.3411,5.3912,0.9827,0.8346,0.1152,0.0101,1.667,5.5441,1.9986,5.0503,0.199,0.9303,5.5894,4.7305,4.159,0.0015,2.5934,1.3063,1.3507,4.9271,1.7955,0.4473,1.3006,0.0003,2.6379,0.0005,0.7408,1.6199,5.5519,2.477,4.2789,0.734,3.6712,1.8732,0.957,1.613,3.4251,1.2207,2.1694,4.4845,0.1887,3.4895,2.9411,0.0031,5.3487,4.5473,2.0648,2.0942,2.706,0.047,0.2461,1.264,0.0002,2.1236,5.6562,3.9731,4.946,3.0976,2.6572,3.5127,0.0825,3.0595,3.5247,4.2632,0.5845,3.4247,0.3811,2.972,3.1999,2.8707,0.0029,0.1263,2.1605,2.1829,0.9638,4.6924,0.0016,0.4712,4.867,5.9165,1.3811,2.4615,0.0194,0.2307,3.6794,5.1625,2.3031,1.3911,2.6397,1.4443,4.2501,0.0075,1.6061,5.5663,0.4555,5.4392,0.8938,0.0003,4.9251,0.5245,5.8466,0.7691,0.0,0.0011,0.6621,0.5808,0.0002,9.1853,1.2584,0.0145,0.1758,0.0828,0.0005,0.0016,0.0054,0.0003,0.0004,0.0018,0.0008,0.0121,7.9168,0.0465,0.3904,0.0804,0.0005,0.0029,0.0123,0.0002,0.0018,0.0001,0.0003,0.0015,0.0003,0.0056,0.0003,0.0029,0.0011,0.0005,1.376,0.7821,1.9386,0.8436,0.0035,0.6557,5.124,0.3815,2.735,5.494,2.8928,0.888,3.5514,0.0735,3.7992,1.0016,2.0145,0.0002,1.7277,2.5854,1.5061,5.0235,2.2611,3.0881,1.3229,4.3328,7.4342,4.4195,5.832,5.4436,1.0734,3.3571,5.1132,3.5087,3.0999,3.9901,1.3413,3.8073,0.7459,1.53,5.3822,4.8594,2.6733,5.4402,4.3833,0.572,5.5505,5.6769,0.5622,1.3733,0.0093,0.6009,0.3212,4.2368,0.014,3.5277,1.7945,0.0028,0.9232,1.5927,0.0003,1.6997,1.5365,1.3378,3.3187,3.3114,0.8494,2.1858,0.8825,4.1123,4.3553,0.0796,1.8745,0.9053,4.8321,2.0212,0.3786,4.4042,0.4651,3.149,0.4502,0.993,3.8821,0.513,1.6286,4.7459,2.3834,4.1512,2.663,3.2162,3.1938,4.4963,0.6737,4.3215,3.2692,4.6562,3.3976,0.0435,0.0754,0.6501,5.7716,2.0903,3.7788,4.6471,1.7752,2.8293,2.0342,0.9316,4.2634,6.0904,5.5708,4.2203,6.1181,0.0139,4.393,2.2286,4.941,4.6531,3.8749,1.939,1.5588,0.7326,3.4213,0.3203,3.0414,0.794,4.8425,4.4636,0.3579,3.7909,0.0025,0.757,2.7635,1.4017,2.8443,1.0063,0.7177,3.3289,3.7152,1.0315,0.8595,5.1127,0.679,4.1083,1.213,1.5033,2.3395,4.4433,2.1118,1.7694,1.01,4.0912,1.8608,5.173,0.3262,4.3229,0.044,2.7309,2.9652,3.9553,2.4332,4.2417,0.8728,4.1183,3.896,6.5656,5.23,0.0014,4.1587,6.5779,2.3199,1.3602,2.0717,4.6609,3.2689,0.5263,0.7401,0.0003,5.9946,1.4644,2.1077,0.4915,2.1928,0.3151,6.4878,0.8166,5.2787,5.1397,1.078,2.1324,1.7216,2.8961,1.2423,2.9879,0.7749,2.5248,1.9307,2.2866,0.083,5.0374,1.3984,3.939,0.9271,3.1638,0.4724,6.2875,5.0192,1.3852,2.6308,0.7641,4.7495,0.6754,2.1676,3.5564,2.9436,4.3803,5.067,4.5191,0.118,1.007,5.5543,1.6883,5.361,0.0472,3.314,3.2007,1.024,0.359,1.1863,1.414,0.0908,4.5383,4.148,0.8177,4.31,3.7104,1.1929,1.5793,5.4983,0.7077,0.6422,2.4921,0.9825,2.5766,1.4263,5.0769,2.407,1.5747,0.3516,0.0763,2.74,1.7427,2.9615,0.3961,0.114,0.3581,5.0621,4.2524,1.7367,1.4344,1.7327,5.0012,3.2649,5.5014,0.2232,0.7203,5.4422,0.8825,3.5948,0.2604,1.8193,4.0298,1.6588,2.3878,2.2363,0.0089,2.4753,4.534,5.0485,0.9516,2.2195,3.2628,3.8563,0.069,5.7344,2.7422,5.4743,0.8494,1.7808,4.4197,0.0877,2.1146,2.3015,5.5158,3.9597,3.0054,5.7559,2.2917,3.9254,2.227,2.3085,1.9147,1.6738,4.0303,2.3263,4.854,1.4069,0.4208,0.692,1.25,1.8729,2.0155,1.077,0.0561,0.4419,4.9855,0.2629,3.746,0.0052,3.2347,3.5986,2.3629,2.2395,0.5475,4.5531,5.7672,4.4016,0.6515,0.678,0.8224,0.0003,1.6925,6.5415,4.8269,6.4838,3.1681,1.3432,4.1436,3.7935,1.6132,2.7119,2.4047,2.918,1.2392,4.2131,3.993,5.6741,4.4334,1.3341,1.0423,3.5637,5.6358,2.2824,3.1744,0.048,0.1595,2.1014,0.0003,1.6872,0.0014,1.5061,2.0256,0.4461,1.1167,0.3999,0.7955,0.0526,0.0031,0.1986,4.2189,2.6082,0.0003,2.5647,1.5767,0.352,7.2,0.4134,4.6815,3.5144,2.0728,1.6948,3.9053,5.3014,1.9709,0.0731,0.9802,5.1899,0.2403,0.8392,5.0352,2.9554,0.5364,2.6211,2.87,0.2999,3.2681,2.9275,0.0171,2.0638,4.7538,4.4991,1.8115,0.5321,0.3717,0.8307,0.9535,0.0003,1.0269,0.0017,0.8163,1.4508,0.3216,0.3841,0.1818,0.272,0.0085,0.0043,4.6607,0.4155,0.2549,0.0003,0.4252,0.188,6.7703,2.8663,0.1374,0.0122,4.5842,4.8426,0.8134,1.8538,0.7966,2.306,1.3356,4.4333,4.8842,2.0222,3.2996,4.7538,0.337,4.1726,1.5972,0.7069,0.0004,0.6303,2.2773,3.0083,0.5115,0.5667,0.4486,3.6212,1.2498,3.0599,1.5657,0.6693,0.0005,0.3813,1.8616,1.3042,0.146,0.5093,0.2069,5.0373,1.3038,1.2238,2.6014,3.1213,

{"id":4537,"ended":false,"length":739,"gen_text":"The first wave of the Machine Revolution has come. But it wasn't from the A.I. of the supercomputers. The first wave was led by the vending machines. And so far, that has been true to those machines. And the other machines, like ours, have also come up with technologies that allow workers to collect goods, and to work within time, and to be organized into networks that can handle transactions.\"\n\nHe said that the world is coming to a junction today.\n\nHe said the computer age is here where he believes human workers can become more productive.\n\nHe said that the machine age was not always so important, but more powerful and more profitable.\n\nHe said that for instance, we've seen our share of innovation explode, and that's partly because of the machines.\n\n\"Many more computers can be created, and they come into demand faster. But we also are getting smarter and smarter and we're becoming more and more powerful,\" said Mr. Leipold. \"We are also now moving ahead in making the things we do very much easier... This may be the era when the next major innovation is emerging.\"\n\nMr. Leipold noted that the machines have been making life easier for us. He said that the next generation of computing technologies will be much, much easier to understand (and to use). He said machines will be able to \"turn our daily lives around without any worry and without leaving us too distracted or too stressed\".\n\n\"We've also seen a lot of progress as they've grown more efficient and more practical \u2014 but this one's different, too, because they are getting thinner.\"\n\nMore data and more speed\n\nThe machine age is not without its flaws, however.\n\nNot only did there be a significant surge of productivity in the last few decades, but there have also occurred a notable stagnation in wages. And that stagnation has led to the sharp decrease in the share of workers over 35. In other words, there have been fewer workers over 65 when it comes to getting a good start in life.\n\nAlso, Mr. Leipold said that he believes machines will be able to create the things that many people had dreamt about having with their minds.\n\n\"When you're not thinking about doing anything but your own day-to-day life, things will turn for you and you think about being productive, but we will not ever realize that there is anything better to be having than to be productive. So it's quite an exciting time to be an entrepreneur today,\" Mr. Leipold said.\n\nBut he said if it's not that big a deal and if there is a big problem with machine learning, it may take a very long time before all of these machines become profitable (except maybe that there's enough money in the system at this point).\n\nMr. Leipold said that he also believes that the future of the industry, and today's economy, will involve many new technologies.\n\n\"The key thing is that we're investing in the fundamental understanding of human labor as well as of how it's performed, and that's in terms of the ability of us to understand how things are performed, what's been done and where it's put in place,\" he said. \"It's not just about how we're working; it's about understanding how human labor will be used in today's economy, where it has to be applied, how it's not being used on the battlefield, how we are working that could radically change things.\"\n\nIn essence, he said that as humans

{"id":2186,"ended":true,"length":765,"gen_text":"You're a thief who breaks into homes, but try your best to stay undetected. You lubricate the hinges to prevent squeaky noises, you sweep the floor to get rid of footsteps, etc. Eventually, you fix more than you take, and rumors spread about a mysterious, helpful fairy in town.\n\nHowever, that fairy is almost dead. Her name is the same as her beloved brother in the Fairytale, and she is only able to make you think that you are really doing something wrong. When you first meet her, she tells you that she was once called'mother.' As you go through the labyrinth of labyrinths, and find what is she talking about you begin to wonder if her name actually is the same as your brother. The problem is you will need to make more than one of these, but one thing is certain for now, since you will need to be careful about picking them off each time: your brother will probably know what she means more than you do.\n\nYou will need to check with the villagers around them to ascertain if your brother actually looks like your brother, or what will happen if everyone starts to doubt you. You should now be worried about making friends with some of the other inhabitants.\n\nFinally, you must make a decision, as you must get your brother's attention on a daily basis. You must also have a few things your brother cannot do (and can't even do ), such as staying in your room, which will make him question whether you've even met your brother, or what you really want to do with him. You must also always make sure that your brother is always at home in this world.\n\nIn the game, any party can play a fairy tale, but this one's a bit different. The main point is that you will be using the fairy tale as a strategy by taking it upon yourself to avoid losing your brother in this world.\n\nNow, you have your brother, where to find him.\n\nNow what are you going to do? You might want to take a different approach. Take those things you want to solve with ease, or perhaps with just a little help from your friends. The first thing you may want to start is to talk about him.\n\nThis means, if you want your brother to stay in your room, the only way you can save his life isn't giving him anything. In any case, you will not be able to help him, but you can help him by making sure your brother is at your house. When you go on the train, after getting over.\n\nDon't try to leave him alone : this is a problem that you will need help with. If some of your friends leave this world to pursue other things, it will mean that if your brother is on his way back home, then you need to take steps for him to get back home.\n\nMake sure all of these things are addressed correctly by your other friends. Have them show you your brother's path to help him with whatever, if possible.\n\nYou can find the game in the shop at local time and download it for free from here.\n\nFor a complete list of achievements and tips, please visit the main achievement guide for this.\n\nNotes and Tips\n\nIf you are at all sure that you can help your brother, you will likely not find it here. The only way to get him back to the city of the elves is to go on to work with them, as they will want to let you come in and help find him, so make sure to report him to the police on time. You may also want to bring someone to your house.

{"id":2780,"ended":true,"length":718,"gen_text":"A secretive love blossoms between a well-known blogger and the NSA agent who tracks his\/her every move online.\n\nIn one of the most stunning cases of privacy litigation ever, the NSA seized his\/her business and all his\/her personal data.\n\nJust three short months ago, the Government said that the UK's Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ordered the phone company Verizon to remove its'sore and inaccurate' software.\n\nIt revealed on Thursday what he had revealed about his activities:\n\nWhen I tried to make contacts with some journalists back in the US with the premise that they had done right by US citizens I had never heard of a case where a company wanted to see a customer's identity or location, which is what I had done.\n\nWith more than 80 days to go until the legal settlement was finalized Mr Snowden's former job, which included monitoring internet traffic from Hong Kong and the US, will go on to serve as an officer at NSA and the intelligence agency who controls the internet.\n\nMr Snowden has now revealed more about his spying activities in this feature documentary which is expected to become available later on September 30, with additional interviews.\n\nWe are hoping that you can be a part of the story of this case.\n\nThe Guardian revealed yesterday that two French whistleblowers have released a letter to President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nIn it the two former NSA whistleblowers revealed how the USA's national intelligence agencies conducted a highly secret phone call with a Russian spy\n\nBoth had expressed concern about Russia's annexation of Crimea and hacking Democratic Party groups, and Mr Snowden said that the NSA sought to use the phone call as a'smear' for Donald Trump, and in effect used this pressure against him to justify surveillance powers.\n\nThe NSA's surveillance was supposed to provide 'intelligence on foreign movements, where any foreign intelligence collection may be used to target one's own domestic or foreign policy,' says the two former NSA whistleblowers.\n\nIt said 'the US has developed a new approach to intelligence collection that will allow him to work closely with the intelligence, civil, intelligence and security departments to ensure that the NSA conducts its own and third-party investigations,' says the former NSA contractor\n\nThe two former NSA whistleblowers have now released a letter to President-elect Donald Trump detailing the NSA's surveillance procedures.\n\nUS whistleblower Andrew Gleicki's revelations that the UK's National Security Agency has secretly collected data on citizens through eavesdropping programs is sure to reverberate as American citizens are urged to demand that this information be released.\n\nMr Gleicki said:\n\n\"The real question is whether there is any legal legal basis for any of my requests to the USA. We should all understand that we are acting as the whistleblower that the public knows them to be and that we will hold them accountable for their actions.\"\n\nMr Snowden also revealed how the NSA tapped the phone of US whistleblower Edward Snowden in Hong Kong in 2010.\n\nFor months, U.S. government agencies have been attempting to track down Mr Snowden as he tried to file legal paperwork in order to keep his case as secret as possible.\n\nHowever, some have argued that the NSA was in fact spying on him and his email server and that the collection of the data took place in a clandestine way.\n\nThe new NSA whistleblower says that the spy agency's methods are only minimally invasive as they could easily be circumvented to find the actual source of the information.\n\nThis could even be used as a pretext to arrest individuals without having to wait for a warrant.\n\nMr Snowden says that the spying is highly secretive as US intelligence agencies have had a 'cabinet of the

{"id":3980,"ended":false,"length":653,"gen_text":"Sunday Free Write : Leave A Story, Leave A Comment - Keeping up with the Joneses Edition\n\n:, - Keeping up with the Joneses Edition You can view all entries for this article\n\nThis section is a stub. You can help the Joneses by.\n\nIt describes a family called the 'Oyster' who make up four of the ten families present at the end of the movie.\n\nContents show]\n\nCharacter Details Edit\n\nThe O-Zone were a family who was created by the O-Zone. On the other hand, the O-Zone are descendants of Kiyoshi's O-Zone family who were both children of Kiyoshi's grandfather, Misei Yagami.[1]\n\nRelationships Edit\n\nThe O-Zone love each other extremely hard and are very loyal people.[2]\n\nThey are the most faithful family they know, and there is one member who also has five O-Zone members present.[3]\n\nTheir relationship with R\u014dky\u016b Tsurutsuki is very good, and they spend hours on holidays together, like last year. O'Sensei was worried about R\u014dky\u016b when he asked him to give her some free time. The O-Zone's friendship with the Tsurutsuki is great, as their relationship is similar to the relationship between Todoroki and K\u014dry\u016b's friends.[4]\n\nWhile most people could never live as they did, R\u014dky\u016b had an innate ability to grow. Although he liked living as a tsuki, he did not give himself up as a tsuki due to his love and commitment.[5]\n\nR\u014dky\u016b is a little more adventurous in life, which was due to his mother's inability to do many activities. He even grew a small amount of grass that he cut through because it was not healthy. After his mother died, R\u014dky\u016b was happy when he was given a good diet by his father, and he became a good person; at some point, he felt sorry for R\u014dky\u016b for being spoiled.\n\nDespite his love of being a tsuki, even as a young person, R\u014dky\u016b still does not try to be one. He does have a hard time keeping up his day job, and he's not that kind of person to do anything for nothing.[6]\n\nR\u014dky\u016b is quite an emotional person. His attitude is a little harsh because he does not want to disappoint anyone by doing things like going to parties that he would never do if it were him.[7]\n\nKiyoshi O-Zone's character is made up of three boys. They are also the family's main supporting characters, and the members of the family are the O-Zone family's best friends. Their favorite thing to do are to make new friends and keep them in line.[8]\n\nTheir greatest fear is loneliness. They tend to feel angry, because their friends don't think about them for long enough, and they won't notice if you are talking to them or your best friend.[9]\n\nTheir second most powerful ability is their ability to read the mind of anyone in a way they perceive to be a threat to them.[10]\n\nR\u014dky\u016b believes in friendship and always gives R\u014dky\u016b everything he
