Is there something special about burgers, and is it that people won't stop eating it?\n\n\nThank you for your time and look forward to doing a better job on your next post.","token_len":123,"entropy":[3.7235,6.6711,4.8172,4.2473,9.3588,1.4991,1.7413,5.1173,2.5318,2.846,2.5503,7.6979,2.4705,3.0121,3.4518,2.632,3.9693,0.7708,4.0517,0.0003,3.7357,0.8447,3.5183,2.1854,2.1651,1.0873,4.5275,5.0795,3.1984,3.2722,2.4914,3.3,0.9006,2.3599,2.5219,5.1592,5.1097,2.3866,5.8931,1.8896,0.5906,3.2947,5.3695,1.6711,2.823,3.3644,3.5308,0.8728,2.5474,5.6161,0.997,2.0327,5.5664,4.0143,1.8037,2.3105,4.6096,3.7907,2.2059,5.3599,0.8525,0.1516,0.2687,0.4989,0.4363,2.3005,3.7463,0.6955,3.3173,5.468,2.4629,1.2053,0.2631,4.5486,4.4034,2.3123,0.1932,0.0865,1.0954,5.6491,6.1061,1.6871,1.2754,0.9031,3.8069,1.4889,1.4143,2.933,0.5294,5.5641,3.4901,3.1197,3.3844,0.9982,4.0497,3.2037,5.5873,0.0013,3.9096,1.5423,2.1828,1.4485,1.0681,0.0003,4.1232,0.0395,1.0091,1.1099,0.7347,1.7314,4.6708,0.1026,0.008,4.7272,2.7043,4.7479,0.2048,2.9698,1.5512,1.5414,2.689,0.479]}

Many have been using cards like Azkaban for years to get their wizards into a tournament, and some other recent examples include the ban on casting spells during or after the school holidays and the ban on drinking alcohol.\n\n\nOne idea about Magic's future is giving people that can cast spells but can't make spells do them better. The Wizard of Oz will use all of his magic to help his wizards make a better potion but for some reason, he will not see a benefit from having them cast his spells or casting spells by themselves. As a magic user, can you be the wizard who can really help?","token_len":161,"entropy":[12.0863,6.2469,6.0941,2.5649,6.8313,0.8541,3.4018,2.9553,6.9529,2.7808,2.7802,9.1413,3.4007,0.2198,0.9907,3.9057,4.6807,1.3677,0.4323,3.8202,5.1426,2.241,2.0809,4.8628,0.9764,0.6304,0.0071,3.145,2.2727,5.3721,1.3482,3.0165,4.7999,1.1633,1.1459,5.5221,0.8273,5.424,3.6647,2.5382,4.637,4.496,1.129,5.8404,0.7667,0.0006,2.9127,0.9573,1.3828,2.2655,1.3647,1.0943,2.236,3.3109,4.5081,1.4037,1.6444,2.8918,6.141,5.6915,2.85,0.5294,1.8517,5.3868,0.4035,6.1668,1.4075,4.4581,5.7553,0.3262,1.518,4.4154,2.3916,3.2893,0.9117,1.7307,0.0871,6.1372,1.4977,1.9961,4.047,0.0004,4.7486,5.6578,5.2083,2.3558,3.7734,2.7205,0.6415,6.8093,2.9931,5.2119,3.241,2.8432,0.3228,4.7029,2.6577,0.0786,4.0118,2.7839,5.0414,2.2303,4.3462,1.1112,2.5317,5.4202,3.1257,0.0106,3.9021,4.0145,5.0766,1.3375,0.9311,1.5325,0.8518,2.6567,2.3079,4.5414,2.9092,3.0869,2.9712,3.0519,5.5208,5.69,2.3618,1.0079,1.535,1.7445,3.0076,1.3226,5.98,3.1797,3.3217,1.2208,3.504,2.4492,1.369,4.9937,0.3811,4.5588,3.1132,0.8525,4.1201,1.3224,0.2693,4.5098,1.3294,6.4287,1.8481,0.1909,6.1118,0.5716,3.6225,3.4895,2.5218,1.1954,1.134,5.612,2.4003,3.163]}

If our ability to meet today's needs were to catch up to what we did 20, 25, 30 years ago with little or no development, megacities in the future would need significant new development and will inevitably change, as there is no longer a place to go to live and work.","token_len":198,"entropy":[9.9217,1.678,3.8836,3.5194,4.6419,0.4035,0.606,8.376,5.3668,0.0491,9.8365,5.1284,7.8194,0.9499,0.7695,1.9287,0.002,5.9124,0.065,4.4079,2.3852,2.3809,0.193,2.2393,0.9298,3.161,0.5379,0.4379,5.583,3.3585,3.218,4.3581,5.462,0.0062,3.1091,1.0969,2.5644,5.1304,0.2903,5.2784,2.1894,1.5006,2.8458,3.479,4.3659,0.619,1.8536,6.2689,2.227,0.0237,4.5886,5.7049,2.3968,1.1468,4.8806,5.0449,1.0779,1.3356,2.2332,4.9369,4.9561,1.6604,3.3148,4.1664,0.0307,0.0001,1.3726,4.6337,0.7973,6.215,4.0254,4.0136,1.9187,3.8305,5.6129,0.8677,2.9354,5.0168,1.5389,0.7561,0.0002,4.4122,0.8288,3.4484,4.045,2.2379,3.6878,5.8133,3.1318,0.4534,4.4242,6.55,1.3696,1.0752,5.504,2.7381,4.7389,1.5701,1.3301,0.0002,5.0123,1.4559,1.4579,0.0808,0.001,0.8832,3.6693,2.7699,5.0566,3.825,4.8631,3.2873,0.0168,0.9281,2.4214,1.7523,3.1594,0.3947,2.9571,0.0737,1.3889,0.8801,3.5838,0.7705,3.5742,5.3032,0.6879,3.0807,3.861,0.0015,2.0679,3.9513,3.5121,3.7618,1.416,4.103,2.5131,0.5482,5.1491,3.4203,4.3528,0.0409,3.5536,3.3152,0.0017,2.9107,2.7809,1.1715,4.9513,0.0153,1.3798,3.2898,1.4065,3.577,2.2411,1.9896,2.6361,0.4636,1.0099,0.7357,0.0064,4.7872,4.9753,1.3978,0.0348,4.2923,0.4796,3.0563,0.0554,0.0011,2.2185,0.9339,2.1804,1.0738,4.4186,5.6625,3.9762,2.7746,2.0698,5.1602,5.5672,4.9749,3.1226,2.9629,5.6924,1.0945,0.859,2.9722,1.1557,3.4174,1.4641,1.6745,1.4876,3.3233,1.5679,0.877,0.8002]}
