Its success was remarkable because, unlike the first public-private partnership, the credit required children to have parents.\n\nIn 2012, the credit allowed children and businesses to make more.\n\nIt also helped foster more economic independence where parents could offer up and give up their child benefits for new workers or services. The program has continued since, with more than 1 million new members joining the credit program on a monthly basis in April.\n\nBy last year the credit had been phased out: more than two million people were placed in the credit line while another 20,000 signed up for some form of public-private partnership. The new tax credit has helped spur a new development: One million young, bilingual and socially liberal jobs created since the credit program was launched have been created during the program, according to the report.","token_len":203,"entropy":[6.9031,1.4961,1.5273,10.0451,4.1892,9.899,11.6066,0.2477,2.9529,4.9781,5.8767,0.3157,3.2064,1.7049,1.4953,0.1245,2.748,4.6362,3.7934,0.695,0.0841,1.7258,0.4494,1.8925,5.419,5.2593,7.7824,3.4635,3.9732,3.8811,3.0099,2.3684,5.1699,1.5396,0.0573,0.0592,0.7107,5.0565,3.3852,1.7997,4.2329,2.2607,2.834,2.0273,1.7604,4.8241,3.4897,0.3888,0.0208,0.5454,0.2869,1.2317,2.111,5.6362,4.9439,0.2549,3.2222,3.1962,2.8451,1.2315,0.0002,2.9477,4.0853,0.0793,1.1363,2.752,4.2489,2.8976,4.6589,6.0731,0.3322,2.7794,2.3251,4.4082,3.0504,0.0001,4.0755,2.0631,3.1433,3.1245,3.5733,3.8411,4.8285,7.692,2.925,1.5011,5.2766,3.043,5.3308,3.0955,1.6774,1.3594,2.4047,4.0846,3.2644,5.1078,5.1786,3.2643,5.3053,0.476,2.5871,3.7749,2.1625,4.1019,3.5956,1.3111,1.4318,2.2245,0.1369,2.1114,1.3064,3.1062,4.903,4.406,1.4471,2.1645,1.829,5.188,2.0548,1.904,0.0739,1.9337,5.0161,1.1652,0.3366,0.0001,5.1826,5.0487,0.4938,4.0984,1.1694,0.5737,2.372,5.1206,0.3611,5.4137,5.0007,0.1328,4.2751,0.8391,1.9525,2.3983,5.9051,1.0448,0.4233,0.9967,4.4439,6.0479,4.4383,4.3763,0.5497,0.0286,5.3833,0.0634,0.6923,5.9414,0.7608,0.002,3.5614,0.8042,0.0633,0.3886,0.4867,2.4626,3.4217,4.318,0.2759,2.7249,3.073,3.1189,2.2927,2.8345,6.0014,3.0053,5.3298,2.9912,4.3901,5.0364,5.7896,2.1999,4.6707,4.0689,6.3408,4.6258,1.6727,0.8574,0.865,3.2537,1.2605,1.8479,1.6715,0.6849,1.3499,6.2934,0.4196,3.0274,1.8805,1.8839,0.0008,0.8997,3.932,0.2263]}

In the following years, a small number of civilian groups have joined the program, with a majority of them operating alongside the government or the local government.\n\nWhat did you know?\n\nThe first U.S. military combat mission against an ISIS controlled province in northern Afghanistan began in 2005 and ended in 2014.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the U.S.-led coalition's operation against ISIS?\n\nAt this point, I believe it is the most effective counter-terrorist and counterterrorism program on the face of the planet.","token_len":211,"entropy":[8.9236,5.0901,2.0744,0.0017,4.8055,2.2406,4.2752,1.8795,5.1316,1.5627,0.7806,1.8516,3.2726,4.5789,5.6276,5.1652,3.153,1.3065,4.9323,1.9877,4.1882,3.2918,3.9864,0.7733,1.3429,1.4966,0.3068,0.489,4.5313,5.4004,0.1668,3.3256,0.0805,2.3635,0.0969,1.8877,3.9607,0.0589,2.0747,5.0809,2.0728,1.0395,2.7693,1.2655,0.5563,5.2254,3.7549,5.3826,3.7969,2.9203,3.096,0.0002,5.8817,5.1018,2.7448,4.1248,4.4542,2.9164,4.4016,0.0001,2.1035,3.7351,0.0013,5.5934,0.566,4.4968,3.4037,0.6252,2.5735,2.0577,0.0221,3.3401,0.8198,0.048,2.3932,0.8959,2.3197,3.1298,0.2388,1.408,2.6106,0.9274,3.2742,1.9893,3.1439,2.2718,6.3576,0.1576,2.8246,3.2907,1.7423,3.4134,4.0713,6.0736,0.571,4.3905,4.2924,1.3267,3.477,0.0048,2.2049,1.8998,3.3079,2.6524,1.8813,0.146,3.7758,4.2722,0.827,0.021,4.7158,6.1068,2.8841,2.2939,0.5628,2.2491,1.1705,3.3453,2.9921,4.3947,0.4709,0.6338,4.2108,5.3542,0.7664,2.8467,4.4924,2.2035,3.2192,2.4853,0.4131,0.4518,0.0002,4.6027,4.1587,1.7202,3.3498,1.1056,0.3382,0.0002,2.024,3.239,3.5774,0.0031,0.0111,0.1991,2.3479,3.5303,1.1989,2.9849,3.7197,4.5185,5.4233,4.8817,0.9476,4.1236,0.4747,1.7845,0.4641,4.0101,2.5187,1.5826,0.1498,2.8746,0.2141,0.8883,0.0002,1.5106,3.3717,0.684,0.8879,0.3797,0.6775,2.2534,0.0006,0.002,1.7471,0.1205,0.9018,1.2712,4.9102,1.8181,0.3077,0.869,0.4501,0.0002,5.6653,1.2024,0.6351,0.3105,1.4711,3.683,2.0051,0.7768,3.3541,2.0857,1.5688,3.8069,0.8106,3.5205,3.5571,2.4242,2.9387,3.8767,0.3306,1.7773,0.0012,0.0725,1.298,0.3195]}

Likewise, when your character is wielding a melee attack: If you use your skill on an already strong character, your hit points are doubled, so you know the other party member is in good hands, and you're about to jump and head to your target's aid.","token_len":223,"entropy":[6.1877,6.6358,2.5835,8.707,11.635,10.7432,4.9028,3.6439,4.5283,5.308,3.7415,3.8747,1.366,7.0178,6.7512,3.124,0.0417,1.1812,4.4888,4.9007,4.8779,1.725,1.8598,2.0749,5.0084,1.666,5.268,5.2476,5.5531,3.1091,0.4815,4.5824,3.5323,2.9646,0.8837,0.6246,4.0735,2.4424,1.187,0.3771,1.2099,0.7721,4.6106,4.2442,1.4931,3.6206,5.5715,4.0511,1.4715,5.7552,4.3341,1.2139,4.3788,4.7285,5.2294,3.7333,7.1078,1.9042,3.9665,0.4811,2.9307,1.1375,1.6551,2.0733,5.4429,0.4098,0.8827,0.0002,5.1606,6.0039,0.006,0.0176,0.1378,0.0003,3.4677,5.011,0.0794,5.2431,3.9027,1.4396,5.2738,4.1296,5.2808,4.0132,4.4148,1.1428,5.4153,3.8548,2.3185,0.3924,2.0617,4.5334,5.0711,2.4594,1.6468,3.4097,1.7547,4.7963,1.3613,3.6976,4.7607,0.399,2.6619,0.9143,3.6064,4.6511,2.5267,1.3565,5.2882,1.6756,1.6935,3.4157,3.8978,4.4488,3.9134,3.9552,1.8425,2.8853,3.0138,4.1452,3.0294,4.346,3.9251,1.2167,2.9656,1.6314,1.3082,0.3257,3.3122,0.931,0.0583,4.6622,1.8165,6.0293,3.6976,2.9587,4.6774,5.9486,2.7839,1.0879,2.4542,1.1305,1.3496,0.5346,3.0284,6.1743,3.8131,0.2718,0.5113,1.3711,5.6388,3.2405,1.8013,0.6076,0.3027,1.3811,1.334,3.7612,2.2502,4.1641,4.7874,2.9101,0.9362,3.3834,1.6174,5.0499,0.611,0.7412,4.4456,0.1526,3.5285,3.9932,0.8978,1.3679,5.1139,0.3764,3.3071,2.2991,1.0657,0.8155,0.4858,0.378,0.0554,0.0795,0.0415,0.4427,0.0539,1.6437,0.1556,0.1408,3.6474,5.5642,0.5519,1.2205,3.514,0.8936,2.4902,1.3131,1.4443,3.3302,5.6464,2.3772,2.5772,1.1823,3.4271,5.4495,2.3902,2.1086,0.5305,1.2072,2.1305,4.9066,0.055,5.186,4.9407,5.3898,3.0301,2.6601,2.8683,2.7638,4.1038,0.4876]}

Chris then shows up and starts laughing uncontrollably while trying to talk with the camera (Chris says it's because he's too intoxicated and the new iPhone can be seen on his friend's laptop screen).\n\nCrazy Credits\n\nTrivia\n\nGravity Falls takes place in a galaxy far, far away in this universe.\n\nChris was voiced by Peter Slott.","token_len":227,"entropy":[7.3478,3.4796,3.42,3.0412,7.2054,5.0503,1.1413,2.2735,6.031,0.2606,3.6278,13.0707,4.6839,1.7651,9.036,0.0287,0.0601,0.4035,4.4776,0.9506,4.6754,3.0156,1.8111,2.1299,0.6236,5.3136,3.3679,1.3168,3.0682,0.7483,2.3662,2.005,5.3483,2.9253,2.9402,6.4427,5.3967,3.5787,0.0839,6.1046,1.7377,5.3583,3.0421,0.5536,3.2261,4.1444,5.6105,1.4776,4.6361,0.5975,1.8406,2.5975,4.4101,3.5964,0.0328,2.7852,5.4815,6.273,1.7326,1.9417,2.3683,3.8417,0.0014,2.9054,0.5444,1.0649,2.6621,0.0045,2.7666,4.7063,0.7918,4.4043,2.2928,5.4994,2.4143,4.1314,3.1598,3.8931,2.3648,0.6669,1.1534,0.9798,3.7339,0.0002,3.953,2.4798,0.5429,1.5691,3.3014,3.5646,4.7746,0.6801,2.358,1.2085,2.132,2.1196,4.3176,6.3071,5.183,0.2558,0.2446,2.0158,5.0537,0.4106,2.1174,1.9439,1.6222,1.8197,1.5348,1.0932,1.9086,1.7889,1.2861,3.5694,4.1454,5.4218,1.1958,4.2192,2.0544,1.4324,0.5401,2.6262,5.7891,4.4827,1.2609,0.72,2.4357,3.1676,5.9414,0.5441,5.6277,5.8432,1.5302,0.8155,6.038,2.7463,0.9875,1.9192,4.4584,4.6228,3.759,0.9951,0.5112,5.5877,1.9228,4.5121,3.7981,1.3683,2.9469,1.6373,2.3828,2.2694,3.8066,1.9186,1.4019,3.052,5.6017,4.5389,0.0025,3.3695,4.0597,0.0533,2.987,4.1885,2.5363,3.4854,4.797,3.9901,3.168,1.9697,0.5373,3.0975,0.6955,1.1183,3.9111,5.7167,2.5829,3.58,5.602,0.5483,4.5906,3.1324,3.6796,1.768,1.3766,5.5715,0.0686,3.5053,2.4539,0.8749,0.8841,0.0002,4.5909,2.7683,0.4518,0.2849,0.0002,4.6803,0.1556,0.0003,5.6783,5.1112,0.1535,4.9329,0.0177,0.6606,1.4248,4.812,0.224,0.1282,0.0018,0.0215,4.2629,3.6205,0.9933,0.643,0.6376,0.0002,3.0791,3.7495,3.7814,0.0275,4.7937,5.1106,1.5777,0.8934]}

The entrance test to heaven is so bizarre you can't tell which choice to pick... but one that makes the difference between life and death...\n\nThe fact is if you choose to have a great orgasm and get it off, you have to have sex with a woman who gets into your life with that orgasm after that. And once you have sex after that and say \"I just didn't think it would be good enough\", you have to say that and give her what she wants or she's going to have to go through with it.

The other is attempting to see if there's a natural way to capture images of the ocean so researchers can develop a better way to use radar.","token_len":235,"entropy":[7.1549,0.3239,3.4049,9.2823,5.5385,12.4054,10.0102,0.6049,2.497,1.2698,4.351,0.0139,0.7485,2.007,5.5336,1.1434,4.8782,2.9955,7.3228,5.4059,9.3951,2.5285,14.2594,0.0167,0.1756,1.0446,3.1594,0.4241,0.3619,1.8907,8.6018,6.4323,1.3376,1.3461,1.1399,5.3243,0.8849,2.4171,1.1103,5.5094,3.2554,1.1358,1.2401,0.0012,3.7234,0.3662,0.0002,4.1092,2.384,0.0016,0.1371,0.3214,0.0013,0.0114,0.0023,0.0001,0.0127,0.0016,0.0092,0.001,0.0016,0.0107,0.0061,0.002,0.0014,0.0015,0.0017,0.0011,0.0012,0.0077,0.0036,0.0003,0.0007,0.0011,0.0072,0.0012,0.005,0.1863,0.0028,0.0019,0.0085,0.0037,0.0019,0.0037,0.0023,0.0006,0.001,0.0023,0.0123,0.0008,6.8987,2.058,4.5046,4.1294,2.9896,0.2368,2.7705,0.6419,1.3921,0.0002,1.9322,3.6822,3.6281,1.6388,4.8092,2.6709,1.3393,3.7012,3.0758,2.5223,3.4188,1.9321,3.112,3.6014,2.3526,0.9267,3.5862,1.2813,3.685,3.332,0.1386,1.542,4.0389,4.3086,1.8246,0.9254,2.184,6.3951,2.6264,5.5727,3.8948,0.4119,2.0425,2.2813,5.8837,3.3567,6.0171,3.568,0.9745,4.9256,1.8845,1.1646,3.3189,5.578,4.4072,1.7253,5.4591,1.572,4.6123,0.8403,0.0582,1.8273,0.6212,4.733,0.0005,0.0,1.6538,0.6112,6.3852,2.0221,4.3107,4.3632,0.147,2.1502,1.611,1.0972,2.8835,0.4353,2.4306,1.4635,0.099,5.6624,1.1232,3.6976,5.2261,0.1661,0.0401,1.3034,4.412,0.7939,5.0128,1.4279,0.5759,0.0002,4.3437,3.7794,5.58,0.0796,4.1379,1.4338,6.3403,3.2628,3.6556,2.0332,5.0747,0.756,3.1189,1.3731,3.3889,3.1301,3.7522,2.9161,1.1728,0.0009,1.5048,1.1449,0.2029,0.3253,4.7298,0.0161,1.7805,0.3252,2.6082,1.1529,0.9488,4.1059,2.9868,0.5462,5.4026,3.1201,0.386,0.7557,1.6027,5.031,3.8358,0.139,5.309,2.0277,1.0954,3.0871,0.2635,4.5383,4.8382,1.5775]}

During the 1980s, HIV transmission from infected people to HIV-positive people was still very difficult. However, it could be transmitted in the form of contaminated blood.

I'd just love to have a few drinks when I got home,\" he says.","token_len":238,"entropy":[12.9358,5.0822,14.7874,4.9057,2.4428,6.9989,1.2603,7.7102,3.4665,3.3525,7.4997,0.7617,1.9927,4.3248,2.5658,3.1458,0.6562,3.5822,0.0092,5.1899,4.2446,1.2919,0.4001,0.0002,3.0962,2.0164,3.2598,1.9068,0.4345,3.6814,2.4985,3.6274,5.7169,2.7584,4.4153,4.4471,2.6582,2.1587,5.7524,1.1979,3.0681,4.3268,0.0681,4.5785,3.1158,2.4367,1.0653,2.2689,1.788,4.6029,2.0338,4.1149,4.9874,2.5611,4.8742,4.7619,4.0476,0.0003,5.4565,0.6627,1.4781,0.6036,0.0002,2.5798,3.4917,3.3891,4.5747,1.293,11.8345,5.9048,5.4892,8.083,10.9044,7.8314,2.5433,1.2823,0.0002,2.7014,2.8663,0.6758,1.6796,3.7697,4.5773,2.9049,1.3178,3.3598,2.9195,1.3544,1.2684,5.5359,3.1709,2.6681,4.4734,4.1769,2.9377,2.9453,0.5457,1.7227,5.1448,4.8327,3.4163,5.6956,0.9939,3.3591,0.6176,0.2252,0.0002,5.6757,2.6721,0.3958,0.4764,1.744,5.6721,5.9285,2.4232,0.0005,1.6803,2.113,3.9616,4.7717,1.5617,3.773,1.4782,1.2291,3.4646,0.6188,4.9179,3.6628,3.1844,0.0223,5.3831,1.6072,0.1011,0.0002,3.6453,2.0895,3.1492,1.4628,1.3089,1.4566,2.5486,0.707,0.7328,5.8325,0.2906,4.4391,1.1024,1.5117,0.8604,1.4956,4.9649,2.4367,0.7999,2.1677,3.003,1.8329,4.9082,1.1911,3.5502,2.1492,5.1599,3.8506,0.3196,1.064,4.9882,2.6295,0.9344,2.053,1.5212,5.0508,3.8698,2.3276,4.4634,1.3173,2.1573,1.4981,0.1461,0.0764,0.0002,3.823,4.0183,1.5307,0.2372,5.5571,0.0057,0.5317,1.6946,0.3833,1.7398,3.0012,4.2046,0.4769,0.1034,4.5984,1.1374,1.1024,1.6604,0.88,3.6078,0.9754,0.2483,0.0003,1.2743,0.9826,4.2345,2.3197,0.1911,3.3214,0.8855,2.7544,3.2032,2.2377,1.3264,4.6081,0.1629,3.8966,1.6603,4.3921,0.0014,3.1202,0.8497,1.3851,3.2015,2.9068,0.6196,1.7555,2.4248,3.4667,3.0904,5.8058,0.636,4.2018,0.581,1.5296,0.0919,0.5991,0.7381]}

The same goes for vampires, and most werewolves seem to be very docile and obedient to their surroundings, even being very rude to those inside their own houses who were most likely trying to kill them.\n\nIn any case, as far as I'm concerned the fact that they don't have long-sleepless long-sleepless days while they try to stalk other living creatures is a little weird because they can always use that time together to escape from the outside world and get some real, fun and relaxing moments.\n\nWhat do you think?

Do you have any favourite examples of vampire horror?\n\n[If there's not one in your set, share this comment below so we can discuss your own.]","token_len":238,"entropy":[6.8157,3.634,3.8051,1.7494,4.1715,5.2977,5.098,4.2209,2.6277,2.2226,1.7489,5.3515,0.0343,1.3451,7.3459,0.4791,1.7392,2.7287,3.7762,4.0176,3.8557,0.0567,1.8626,5.7645,0.0452,2.3539,3.9148,1.0988,4.0793,3.3393,3.5276,3.7922,1.6567,1.9719,1.7371,2.9973,1.6802,3.6791,5.2502,4.8198,3.863,3.8902,3.8084,0.0895,1.0383,0.017,0.3572,1.4254,0.012,5.1732,4.7412,2.5895,0.4725,2.0337,2.8202,3.1371,2.6866,0.0081,0.7032,0.9415,0.1172,0.0558,0.1214,0.189,0.6989,3.6306,0.0572,1.0336,5.5704,3.3934,0.0001,1.4545,5.5579,2.0272,3.7106,4.2887,5.4089,1.1393,6.0996,2.0121,2.2021,1.35,2.9062,4.6167,0.6687,0.0487,1.1041,1.7656,2.6026,4.183,3.7906,0.0904,3.8461,0.2009,0.9658,2.3521,0.3927,0.0003,1.2586,4.9979,1.4907,0.9716,3.638,1.7438,2.3297,5.7977,3.3993,5.5568,0.6995,3.7066,5.385,1.7998,2.0052,4.2256,3.7472,4.0208,5.8132,0.3667,3.8904,0.0331,1.8727,0.0747,0.353,0.9777,0.0003,3.3954,3.1817,0.2644,0.0296,4.0629,1.0484,0.0073,0.8072,2.3583,0.1925,3.57,5.1138,0.0907,2.4501,3.8275,0.0005,1.6071,6.2781,1.7045,6.0387,0.7398,5.3471,5.0652,0.3897,0.5917,0.0114,0.4365,4.8789,6.2528,1.3991,5.1499,0.1357,5.3546,3.7995,6.4082,1.7446,1.2184,1.8023,3.649,3.1668,3.1497,1.3855,3.0356,4.5946,4.3094,3.0121,2.1428,7.9148,0.5613,3.4673,1.5661,1.5717,4.7582,0.0291,1.979,2.8334,2.5231,4.7627,4.4453,4.883,3.4777,4.544,3.4963,1.5897,0.7397,0.0002,4.0987,1.6159,0.1167,0.1399,1.0717,3.0484,0.2296,5.1657,0.6245,4.8234,3.5299,0.6414,2.7397,2.5076,0.0672,1.1665,0.6237,5.0552,6.0201,0.8803,2.2011,1.6148,0.9916,2.2537,0.0003,2.7899,5.8408,4.3139,0.7457,6.0936,1.5848,2.2551,1.0288,5.7761,0.6133,4.519,2.8487,3.9205,1.1791,4.383,1.2298,0.1464,3.7685,4.3615,2.3386,2.3725]}

The trees had not yet been able to stand on top of each other so they were not able to stand up in the snow itself, but since we knew that the trees had no snow, it doesn't mean that snowfall would have remained for any long since the trees had fallen completely. A normal snowfall of any size would have lasted around 6 hours, but that is what happened in the first month, which makes it impossible for the tree branches to have remained in place for some time after the snow became visible.\n\nI can believe that someone at least attempted to capture this type of storm so some of the other trees might have fallen too.

It was never again known as a complete war between England and France, so some of the other powers remained neutral in the war, fighting for their separate states in which they were on opposite sides of the Atlantic.","token_len":240,"entropy":[8.8651,10.5365,7.4164,0.9849,5.6862,9.0331,0.2426,1.1088,1.7339,8.8356,2.0881,1.477,10.3583,0.6548,2.1293,3.4376,0.9058,3.0426,3.2224,5.9079,6.6845,3.2501,8.016,4.0173,9.9974,3.7648,2.6172,7.0458,5.3981,1.1101,2.3032,0.0724,3.6956,4.8484,0.6462,0.5459,3.6613,4.3032,4.9134,4.6754,1.92,1.1349,2.6299,0.3909,1.2603,4.4026,0.0395,4.1363,2.1393,6.742,0.9902,1.0526,4.6974,1.9148,1.5045,5.1814,2.0442,0.1695,0.5234,1.1265,0.62,2.4497,0.0003,5.1802,3.9758,3.0913,1.956,5.4428,2.0936,2.6215,0.0003,4.0948,3.3345,5.0597,1.6879,3.6438,3.8294,4.0574,0.1886,0.8293,4.1425,4.022,2.6993,1.567,5.3355,0.0394,0.8541,5.1785,4.6097,3.2953,3.0185,0.7809,0.1109,5.3894,1.5737,1.0006,0.0002,3.8119,5.1979,0.0187,5.0293,3.06,2.9961,3.5353,5.0446,3.2597,1.4266,0.4959,1.9182,1.0827,4.3227,4.3779,1.0217,1.5309,0.0002,3.1831,4.5522,4.005,1.6138,1.8586,1.6985,0.5117,4.9084,0.7751,1.6581,2.7424,3.7126,2.2269,3.678,0.0299,1.5136,5.1361,2.8989,1.6846,3.7586,5.9624,0.1174,2.4237,1.2318,4.9871,0.1923,2.3637,2.9395,1.8708,0.3919,0.4117,0.0002,1.2458,1.8854,3.847,3.9915,5.0198,0.0014,3.4468,6.2794,4.4842,1.18,1.1523,4.6095,1.8614,2.0594,2.1478,4.2009,3.1518,1.0562,2.0079,2.3381,6.2451,2.7186,4.2724,0.0518,5.2456,1.2411,5.6993,1.3254,6.7881,0.7001,0.3893,0.0002,1.2509,5.629,0.6852,2.278,4.7708,0.169,1.4442,1.9928,2.7782,3.9569,2.5685,3.7229,1.3873,5.3846,3.4811,1.8073,2.7869,0.3844,4.5956,0.5067,5.8758,5.1655,1.6094,2.4734,1.713,5.8741,0.9165,2.4338,1.6334,0.024,0.1328,2.0113,4.7373,4.8172,2.9305,0.2196,5.5398,4.5914,3.9959,1.077,2.8006,0.3656,1.2628,2.76,5.3068,2.05,1.2788,4.9368,3.3119,3.8732,6.0819,1.0496,1.8937,5.2726,2.7713,0.0302,1.3021,0.23,2.1229,0.3365]}

The only way to feel completely free with your life is to read through each of your tattoo scars. This tattoo says \"All of your identity is in the wallet and the bar-code on my neck is my SSN.

That's why the human brain is such a powerful example: it's capable of translating human experiences.\n\nMany more examples can be found in the post about Artificial Intelligence:\n\nA Human Life Is A Very Complex Story\n\nThe book and video are about humanity's understanding of artificial intelligence:\n\nYou can buy the book at Amazon, so you can buy it from the Amazon link. It uses the title Artificial Intelligence: An Artificial Mind to give readers an understanding of a complex story about artificial intelligence.\n\nWe encourage your comments on this article to comment below, where they might serve as a useful test: The Best Science (and the best quotes)","token_len":256,"entropy":[9.9428,10.7823,3.9762,3.7449,8.6854,5.9212,3.7697,3.7229,0.0027,1.1492,1.4188,0.0021,5.4563,5.5972,1.4914,0.3529,4.9524,3.5558,3.3518,4.3258,0.5807,0.8581,3.9034,0.042,0.2286,2.2673,0.0003,2.4741,4.9137,4.6218,4.8878,0.0102,4.1603,5.0225,1.4794,4.0559,5.4556,1.4271,1.2313,4.1833,3.0345,2.9927,2.3563,2.3214,2.6635,0.8182,4.9897,1.3842,3.278,1.3373,1.6518,0.0059,0.3173,6.1161,0.3191,2.2516,2.4182,0.0091,3.5816,3.3677,3.865,1.3714,3.2138,1.7174,5.2647,0.3881,2.405,5.4243,1.8775,3.8673,3.6804,0.2764,0.7574,1.4278,0.456,1.5465,0.0002,5.6355,1.6531,1.7791,5.1657,2.1378,0.5157,2.3454,1.0032,1.2997,3.0862,3.0383,5.1706,2.4904,5.4154,1.4587,5.7341,2.7331,2.6035,2.7751,1.1799,2.4687,1.4626,2.3224,3.3298,3.2394,0.6312,0.5022,5.9925,1.8167,0.6293,5.0569,3.534,3.4219,2.2428,2.3824,1.7008,5.5534,1.7359,0.0484,4.4489,2.1853,2.3847,0.1725,0.8377,3.8003,0.5829,1.1413,2.5106,3.1482,3.5541,0.8579,3.4168,0.3275,2.261,5.2678,3.0418,1.1049,1.5079,3.631,0.0069,5.4914,1.3067,3.5948,3.7509,0.5158,0.0002,5.8609,4.8139,2.5706,2.5655,0.0259,0.1315,0.7345,1.1799,5.7168,3.3779,3.8786,0.0609,2.3157,2.0068,0.0002,3.6293,5.6933,5.8806,3.527,2.9595,3.9453,4.8699,5.0292,0.7478,0.0003,2.5674,5.4299,5.7606,1.748,2.6344,3.2046,6.0934,0.6351,4.6004,0.1432,3.4377,0.0657,2.8868,0.7634,0.0002,4.7945,0.4561,3.4687,0.8731,0.435,2.2174,0.3977,2.1734,5.5442,1.3801,0.541,3.457,1.0093,3.0073,1.8813,2.8372,3.4365,1.4186,3.209,6.7846,1.635,4.5758,3.5255,0.0892,1.3465,3.1917,4.2344,2.3631,3.7507,3.5356,3.8129,1.3269,2.5793,0.0816,4.0538,1.8599,0.951,1.9176,3.0699,0.06,0.5688,0.7592,0.0002,4.4201,5.3125,4.5395,3.3443,1.7453,1.1797,1.5165,2.1684,4.0256,1.3727,1.9469,6.1641,3.4332,3.3177,6.2558,0.2522,1.0535,3.2434,6.1789,4.9527,5.8403,4.7738,3.8742,6.4152,2.5133,3.1676,3.0855,4.1029,0.9194]}

I had been thinking about how to go through the whole ordeal using only knife and knife fighting, and I realised that I couldn't give up.

Jackson, president of the American Humanist Association. \"The notion that the law must not go away is a farce, and this is where Justice Ginsburg's actions were taken.\" But she's also taken note of the legal consequences from her own Supreme Court experience and the legal and scientific evidence that her decision is only hurting black criminals.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision will likely cause some to question Justice Scalia's commitment to a law more than any other in the past five decades.

A law in any law is \"totally onerous,\" said the person. \"You know what, you'd be surprised when it got to the next court.\"","token_len":261,"entropy":[6.9476,0.4318,1.4643,4.8112,0.6007,8.3549,0.5181,7.3691,8.4476,1.5598,3.1264,6.1282,3.1606,4.788,1.2137,2.4819,3.2185,0.0767,3.6993,2.0613,5.5413,3.1793,3.7977,0.4828,2.7001,0.2971,1.284,0.398,1.3256,8.6012,0.0449,1.0601,1.7671,0.9588,2.3787,0.0014,2.0882,2.846,3.6966,5.0001,1.8183,2.584,1.2055,4.5803,4.7429,0.5293,0.0004,0.0,0.0056,3.6208,1.5597,1.2329,5.8034,2.4996,1.7535,5.8321,1.5543,0.379,1.7013,3.6938,2.286,0.0613,0.0039,0.9392,4.3576,2.7433,2.3233,0.8528,3.1447,0.7809,1.2604,5.2184,3.5427,0.343,0.0536,2.0151,1.3681,5.1718,2.5599,3.5424,0.0506,3.9978,0.2312,1.8502,0.1611,0.3214,1.4385,5.0973,0.0296,0.0168,0.4936,0.5919,2.3747,5.8933,0.143,1.7157,4.1678,3.4453,4.3016,5.3629,4.1883,1.4077,2.0593,4.0992,1.0477,2.078,0.8833,4.0996,1.3625,4.7226,2.1687,0.178,0.0063,1.4754,5.0933,3.8524,2.625,0.7183,8.3206,2.1388,3.6947,2.9191,4.0462,5.194,0.1069,0.6913,4.9406,4.2416,5.2262,2.0125,2.7722,5.2026,0.0009,4.5926,2.9256,2.0191,4.2011,4.4597,5.6729,1.9568,1.2796,3.7206,1.78,2.8334,5.0427,4.1838,4.8247,6.6949,0.5957,0.6289,0.0002,2.9362,2.8059,0.0015,4.145,3.7144,2.6718,4.0142,2.0965,2.22,1.5183,2.3745,4.6221,0.1432,3.7886,0.0329,3.7424,4.66,5.711,1.756,2.7323,0.2864,3.5432,1.1934,3.7553,3.5335,0.7562,0.2941,5.1103,4.8237,2.7758,0.0008,3.4858,3.6592,2.1332,1.4903,1.924,0.0014,0.2367,1.8132,0.8202,2.2851,1.5431,5.4725,1.8275,3.0826,1.9579,2.2995,2.1576,2.5387,3.3041,3.5235,2.3979,1.0122,4.7221,2.4039,2.5904,3.4615,0.7408,2.2173,3.3047,3.594,3.6292,3.4087,1.621,2.9295,0.0345,0.1772,2.0562,4.0857,0.0141,1.4148,5.8003,2.6037,1.4501,0.3111,0.0642,4.557,3.4455,4.1559,5.4101,4.5417,1.7794,3.2326,5.1094,1.8945,5.4496,1.93,0.7564,0.9881,1.0496,0.1345,0.9905,1.1798,3.3683,4.45,2.3749,2.4666,2.6874,3.35,1.5682,2.7511,4.4368,2.535,4.54,1.8021,1.327,4.4985,2.6236,0.9308]}

We'll see what happens, which will impact on the rest of the season.\"\n\nThere's nothing more to say.","token_len":262,"entropy":[7.3854,4.3687,0.7387,1.5578,2.5664,8.4304,5.8324,2.6413,5.8479,0.0008,2.996,0.9526,1.7105,1.0158,2.9136,5.1925,0.0016,4.8076,1.4141,0.8267,0.2135,2.3774,0.3021,0.0005,2.6016,6.6239,3.0746,4.927,0.1666,5.2871,2.9917,0.002,5.9289,1.946,2.1311,5.5717,4.206,1.0646,0.3226,0.0021,2.171,3.1049,0.0064,5.5291,0.012,0.3662,0.0001,0.0004,5.9418,4.8555,1.8652,3.7923,2.8698,4.3476,3.8621,1.541,5.6574,0.0038,6.0583,0.9934,1.767,1.9872,5.3779,0.7135,2.1443,0.0484,0.8954,3.2874,1.6387,2.2816,4.5291,1.8918,4.6673,1.7352,5.8582,1.0655,3.4448,2.2394,6.0468,1.2674,5.9767,1.1188,1.2344,6.4886,3.6088,1.6838,3.4152,1.3378,5.5702,0.0351,4.8145,0.4101,3.1194,1.6519,4.3837,0.3841,0.2565,0.0002,5.4559,3.4248,0.0371,2.3404,1.317,4.198,0.6718,3.9148,2.2839,5.0948,0.9764,1.4684,6.0245,5.8707,0.0672,2.064,2.1521,3.0588,2.332,3.8938,2.1963,2.849,0.0462,4.8618,0.0671,1.6352,0.5797,1.0674,1.9929,1.894,5.1406,2.1122,2.4525,3.3079,4.98,2.0319,2.8267,1.3899,4.8154,0.3894,0.0137,0.4683,3.4329,0.3513,2.8247,1.126,2.3216,3.0027,2.9469,3.5954,2.1984,0.0553,5.9878,0.19,0.6887,0.8834,0.0002,3.2562,0.7805,2.0005,5.1774,4.549,2.4972,1.2156,4.3993,1.8406,4.47,1.2888,5.4147,0.1955,5.391,4.7254,1.0792,2.2249,1.1262,2.9125,1.1532,6.3105,0.0044,3.199,0.4907,3.2479,0.0105,0.4204,0.9377,0.0001,1.8374,3.6781,5.9113,5.1171,2.5628,0.0916,1.9851,0.8684,1.9946,3.2849,0.0003,3.9175,1.6795,1.6829,0.8566,1.1782,5.1662,1.5087,0.1465,6.3651,3.8228,0.6202,1.9583,2.9093,1.5371,4.5167,3.1593,0.6584,1.0277,1.8294,1.8103,1.5673,0.8909,4.7165,1.9052,0.204,2.7203,0.0683,0.6696,1.924,0.4434,3.3353,1.9217,2.5965,1.6336,2.1288,0.7603,5.873,0.7537,0.3481,2.5411,1.1257,2.5549,2.0699,0.3219,1.1864,0.3883,2.5545,5.7113,2.5062,5.1874,4.53,1.3261,3.1025,0.0054,0.4046,2.1203,0.6219,0.1272,0.0002,4.0135,1.6409,3.1987,3.0185,1.5136,0.7885,2.2728]}

In the next example we will see more usage example that you will see in the comments.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis blog can give you really powerful insights about your users and build your blogs with real users, and there are a lot of benefits to using a WordPress project like this that are quite clear.\n\nIf you decide to make a blog like this and if you feel confident doing so then please send a few comments and if you think it is your best use of your time then please let me know, even if you feel like it isn't for public consumption.\n\nThanks","token_len":266,"entropy":[4.0641,5.7875,3.0791,5.2387,2.333,7.8452,8.8975,0.6543,1.7447,6.017,2.4098,9.5717,8.0018,0.3731,3.4425,0.1551,1.0154,1.8794,0.8054,0.7702,1.3688,0.0084,4.4075,1.6493,4.8992,3.0383,4.3955,3.3018,2.8494,2.5884,2.5019,0.1866,1.5211,0.3635,0.0002,5.0443,1.5499,1.9772,3.1548,4.5117,1.355,5.3421,1.773,0.7023,1.2871,0.8375,4.9006,3.1716,4.3606,3.1514,1.3876,3.0376,5.535,4.8174,2.6184,4.3283,0.9881,6.3292,0.722,1.3512,0.0001,2.985,4.7828,0.4776,3.7214,4.4944,5.1346,1.6531,1.7603,5.5179,1.4559,4.6329,5.9829,3.1357,3.7394,2.2564,2.287,2.7188,0.4067,1.4637,6.0406,0.0493,0.0001,4.2134,1.7999,4.6101,1.385,2.1787,3.4114,0.9953,2.9888,1.3928,1.3673,1.0841,6.9917,1.2915,0.3691,3.9732,2.9508,5.1376,0.3671,1.182,5.4818,1.1088,2.4252,4.8268,4.7735,3.6415,4.2536,2.5092,0.4067,3.0704,4.4851,5.1093,1.0506,4.3723,0.7513,1.5595,3.8532,2.7938,4.8097,0.0008,5.6358,2.5895,0.0842,0.0429,4.5798,1.3127,3.7141,5.7251,3.6847,3.8382,1.1511,1.8562,5.0752,2.7382,1.8141,3.0689,1.2174,3.1984,2.7053,4.0246,0.9247,1.7415,3.4611,1.1559,0.3562,3.4885,1.9476,2.7831,0.3332,1.1188,0.9543,2.8,5.6422,4.948,5.8213,3.4527,4.0285,2.6176,1.7836,1.4408,0.6093,2.1114,0.6775,0.2578,0.0001,4.2635,0.1173,0.0001,2.6582,3.3517,5.0129,4.8143,0.506,6.1881,3.6887,2.5101,2.0816,1.1626,3.0055,1.318,5.6499,1.6613,4.6763,2.8478,2.75,1.488,3.1669,2.3369,4.589,0.6719,2.0966,0.4432,0.0892,4.1145,0.7821,0.7385,2.3439,5.2176,4.8925,2.0294,0.1293,4.5219,2.3506,4.1692,3.3634,0.5961,1.4667,0.0003,2.0047,0.0709,5.9557,0.1822,3.4245,1.2013,0.9284,2.6886,0.0677,2.3382,4.8258,0.1392,4.4085,4.3998,3.8908,0.2157,2.8165,2.2648,4.1675,2.2327,4.8817,1.2112,1.7688,4.1069,0.246,3.0623,1.7884,1.3415,5.5893,1.8443,2.8666,1.6737,1.6194,0.3735,1.3689,0.8259,2.5068,0.3868,0.0015,4.0899,6.0721,0.2751,0.7456,4.3978,1.4607,1.7251,2.9321,0.0006,2.112,7.4596,1.0492,0.6744,0.8368,0.0002,3.1659]}

{"id":4649,"ended":true,"length":255,"gen_text":"Among the many billions of coins around the world there is one coin of unknown nationality, worth, and age that when flipped will grant any wish as long as the outcome is heads. Among coin collectors the existence of this coin is kept an absolute secret, and the hunt for it is dangerous.\n\nHowever one that has been mentioned in history and on many websites is known to be around in other countries. Many websites are also listing this coin on the 'Fiat' website, where its present location could change once people find out.\n\nAnother coin that has been mentioned is the famous 'Currency Index' which allows you to find what country or currency is listed. This coin seems to exist in the mid-1960s and has been around for some time, but people who were familiar with this fact have never seen it.

And yes, they might even want to reboot, like, once the two rebooted, maybe they may want to send the show back where they left off.\"","token_len":267,"entropy":[9.3521,3.7688,10.0559,3.6878,6.4341,3.1888,1.9026,4.3353,2.1973,1.8761,0.0079,5.0789,4.876,5.3585,5.4888,2.4313,5.3801,2.7734,1.8994,2.6215,0.9082,3.3208,2.6974,5.2486,2.1733,5.0018,2.7199,3.4947,0.5637,1.0304,0.0002,4.4114,3.026,0.5429,5.3242,2.6517,3.8253,0.2129,4.2124,3.9722,1.3033,0.7909,4.5024,2.0815,0.1059,3.8975,3.2906,5.7594,0.7683,4.8904,1.4338,0.5111,1.7615,0.4631,1.5904,1.2097,4.0465,2.6258,0.9012,0.0001,4.8203,2.0491,5.5523,3.4377,0.7424,2.146,4.7165,6.8076,2.4896,4.0879,0.1822,2.1524,4.9434,4.0068,4.3299,0.0069,1.4051,0.2911,1.824,3.7919,3.3999,0.7781,0.6991,0.7529,0.0001,4.3933,4.6417,3.8482,5.5938,4.9011,4.5326,2.5785,3.6578,5.9623,2.8743,4.088,1.3867,1.4576,5.3792,4.1992,2.0248,2.2151,0.5751,0.424,0.0417,6.1201,2.7992,0.7484,0.9076,4.2727,2.6079,0.1616,0.001,0.0016,4.2111,6.2679,4.3319,4.7234,2.4781,0.6147,1.3324,1.7605,2.0839,4.9646,0.0217,3.1212,2.122,3.4019,2.9444,2.8435,1.0511,2.4326,3.806,0.3289,2.376,1.559,3.5763,5.485,4.8019,0.5767,2.1503,0.9533,3.6813,5.7275,1.965,2.2914,2.6013,2.3335,2.6275,0.9392,4.17,2.4915,2.6392,2.2486,2.4908,2.6895,5.4764,5.5358,0.0325,4.1106,4.3778,2.9319,3.8727,5.5105,0.339,1.1372,2.412,2.1832,3.3805,2.1003,4.6414,1.7086,4.9847,2.0661,0.0104,5.5095,3.5791,2.9018,4.4352,1.1627,2.6499,0.2254,3.7164,2.1119,4.6379,2.5403,1.7397,3.2014,4.2738,0.0532,4.765,1.4294,0.6161,0.0002,1.239,3.7802,4.0213,1.6645,1.9537,4.6856,1.3911,0.6406,5.6101,1.3926,2.5907,4.6141,1.3763,1.0059,0.3471,0.4711,0.2757,3.8688,0.4411,2.357,2.6961,0.0456,1.4919,1.4518,0.0001,1.5601,3.5731,1.1616,0.3277,1.0858,2.9389,0.5229,3.4678,3.2057,1.7882,5.1798,3.6209,0.5888,2.5319,1.2614,2.5572,5.9277,0.0601,4.6976,3.4841,4.2634,2.9011,0.2471,2.7629,2.0809,5.0678,1.9136,4.9501,2.0498,5.0726,4.6696,0.2973,1.3608,3.5625,2.4093,5.695,1.1233,0.1788,5.7929,2.1707,2.5908,0.202,5.5606,1.6257,1.4577,0.1469,1.079]}

But at least he's not afraid to talk.\n\nThey might be good for a show, but really good for a comic.\n\nGood stuff, like this one.\n\nAnd finally, this is very good.","token_len":270,"entropy":[2.6222,4.5008,0.2783,10.1139,5.2341,0.0008,2.944,5.0532,7.3717,0.4099,2.322,4.8172,1.8755,2.7872,4.684,0.4206,1.3491,2.658,6.1157,2.6974,0.0004,4.8671,7.8792,1.9387,6.0201,0.6484,1.5217,6.2915,0.1664,3.0037,3.6889,3.9189,4.5061,5.5395,1.041,3.0197,1.2324,3.2806,2.3619,3.0998,10.1533,1.3273,7.5358,4.5963,0.9925,1.489,0.0091,5.3362,0.0586,4.4329,2.4691,3.5901,0.2849,3.8059,5.4952,1.2439,5.5291,4.8326,2.8854,2.9527,0.2847,3.2832,1.1677,2.049,3.2259,5.962,4.1823,3.7818,0.6845,3.6475,2.3523,3.663,3.5673,0.3599,4.9197,1.2985,0.7404,1.0003,0.0002,4.6921,2.1797,2.1701,3.5277,0.4693,4.9364,1.9516,3.1833,2.0313,1.9009,1.6274,5.4173,1.4354,4.1031,0.8836,1.092,0.0002,5.7039,5.5735,5.9583,0.9521,5.1301,1.4689,2.5216,0.5352,6.0655,5.1347,2.3926,4.9768,2.6919,4.9484,0.0002,3.2812,2.2965,2.6578,3.7992,2.7546,2.3846,3.9387,3.2656,1.0656,5.6478,5.1262,2.1674,0.1215,4.3965,2.0229,0.5442,1.0109,1.5273,0.0002,4.3555,1.3885,0.0715,1.8566,2.5144,3.9703,2.4736,1.7573,0.0345,1.5564,5.2034,0.1498,5.1818,2.6818,2.0597,5.0485,1.8152,4.3802,0.827,4.1341,3.3923,4.9676,2.5164,3.6752,1.3697,0.0474,2.4627,0.0509,3.7486,0.5554,1.5985,4.697,2.7889,1.7187,0.0681,6.1401,1.8554,3.106,4.485,3.137,2.1307,3.7237,2.3257,2.1433,3.9493,5.142,3.9407,4.2868,2.1251,3.775,1.4089,2.624,2.0023,6.3841,2.9051,0.4188,5.1594,5.3171,2.348,0.0004,2.9737,2.0611,1.4528,1.1527,2.429,5.1897,4.3887,3.0706,3.214,3.4125,0.8396,5.6755,1.8701,1.5407,0.2207,2.3989,2.145,1.1532,4.0464,3.6379,5.6122,1.3843,4.0484,2.6683,1.1338,4.1707,1.797,1.6181,5.2473,0.9997,2.7394,5.2334,0.9005,1.8565,4.1875,0.5526,2.9966,1.1513,1.638,5.3473,0.6299,4.1214,2.5165,0.6296,0.0002,5.514,4.6584,1.558,2.8415,3.8757,1.7666,6.2703,1.1017,0.3965,5.2234,2.9962,0.4069,0.701,4.1902,0.7756,1.0299,0.0002,6.1309,5.7766,2.2965,5.4884,3.328,2.2902,0.9781,0.4657,0.0002,2.8725,4.9213,0.3608,2.4017,1.9093,5.6295,2.1678,0.9428]}

The man who shot his two daughters, and robbed her life with those two bullets has lost his right of first refusal after refusing to pay the ransom.\n\nIt is a horrible irony, and this is where I say this to my family.\n\nHe's been taken into custody by cops with the use of tear gas.\n\nI don't know why I would want my daughter to die but, with this police state, what do you expect to happen now?\n\nNow, the more I think about it, it makes me really angry.\n\nFor an easy answer, it would make me want to kill and never live again.\n\nI can never imagine someone using force and violence to stop a crime, so I'm afraid for my daughter's life.\n\nIt would be great if we could simply get on with moving forward on a good, lasting day for her.\n\nTo that end, I urge you to visit The City of London and the British Transport Police: www.bartleytrouble.org","token_len":271,"entropy":[3.7506,2.3294,9.3342,3.0718,7.9915,1.6422,2.1893,5.3949,9.013,1.7897,4.6422,2.2376,2.3646,2.4621,3.806,5.8682,4.7748,0.0935,4.7921,1.8292,6.4437,2.0338,0.4382,2.1675,0.789,1.6749,0.0184,5.54,0.1253,4.2507,1.7278,3.0251,0.2837,2.667,2.7413,2.0962,5.6865,1.324,2.9424,4.5089,1.6369,3.6942,3.7246,3.112,2.6012,2.3018,2.5143,0.0022,0.8524,2.2746,6.0334,0.56,4.9275,3.2218,5.4889,4.0425,2.4297,4.8811,1.7934,2.7655,1.2706,0.3377,1.0271,0.6463,4.8585,2.0773,2.7422,2.9336,5.5124,2.5876,5.9343,3.1735,5.1062,3.9193,2.8681,3.7827,5.9874,0.8206,3.7555,3.081,2.9959,0.4387,6.0319,4.786,0.1972,2.7653,1.861,2.991,0.7881,0.9328,0.0002,3.4961,0.6153,2.6779,4.9557,3.7814,2.2137,2.215,4.4221,1.172,3.6979,2.9046,3.9096,2.4342,2.7272,2.794,3.0088,1.1228,1.9447,0.0001,5.1326,4.1227,2.3974,4.8365,2.1238,0.0976,2.1479,5.1243,4.2811,1.4763,5.7573,0.0032,6.1332,0.0523,1.5576,1.7916,0.0001,3.0317,3.0373,0.0008,1.0074,2.5495,2.7907,2.5651,1.6751,2.5307,1.2556,0.8831,1.5148,4.8157,3.4593,4.8202,2.9733,4.956,2.7512,0.6872,4.1354,2.5947,0.6204,2.4335,2.4583,0.1487,5.5242,0.5412,0.6863,0.0001,4.5975,0.7501,3.2737,5.3634,0.9901,1.438,0.0406,0.467,0.1303,2.2018,2.4181,0.4376,4.6462,1.6574,0.3088,0.8293,0.0001,4.7699,5.3989,5.6239,2.1742,0.5253,3.1458,2.5767,4.5499,2.1758,2.7519,0.1265,1.3917,5.0766,5.7293,4.0522,0.7488,0.1782,0.4372,0.0002,2.0426,3.4103,4.627,3.1187,5.3156,5.5471,3.3661,3.345,1.1917,1.1662,2.6269,1.2256,3.0316,2.3158,4.4085,1.3079,2.5586,3.9478,3.5572,0.219,0.6476,0.7397,0.6916,0.3688,0.2758,0.0001,3.2007,2.3468,0.9824,4.7252,0.4024,2.3791,0.9778,5.4472,3.7866,4.3928,0.3317,6.6357,0.4489,4.4179,2.4798,4.3543,2.0286,3.7844,5.748,2.624,2.9008,0.9028,0.2992,0.0002,5.4471,2.6888,0.0871,0.051,0.5977,5.4159,0.2819,0.1727,4.4298,4.0047,5.661,0.4735,4.4755,2.6732,3.9793,5.0145,5.005,0.0294,6.2696,3.4064,0.0008,5.6513,1.7781,4.744,4.1057,0.7062,0.4099,1.3252]}

And if he is the best-looking person I know, so can you, and so may I, love you, Johnstone?\n\n(via The Guardian)","token_len":278,"entropy":[4.1223,4.8122,1.7768,6.0234,1.2622,3.7435,1.4499,5.0951,0.3135,1.9381,0.8018,4.2826,0.1567,2.6065,0.034,1.2123,1.407,0.0072,3.4046,3.2315,3.0064,4.5884,3.1024,4.3978,2.5906,3.3093,2.3533,1.6094,1.9641,2.8284,1.3032,0.2035,0.7588,3.9938,4.252,2.9782,1.3735,4.5742,4.8926,2.8184,2.5562,4.3063,0.8599,6.1194,1.9162,5.2931,2.6124,0.847,2.5024,0.0005,0.2077,3.494,2.6782,3.0583,1.166,2.8734,4.0388,1.7111,1.5504,3.252,2.4474,4.1401,3.8572,1.6955,5.1377,5.8431,5.4739,0.9417,0.0002,5.796,1.0229,2.3885,2.8785,3.3869,5.6037,4.3388,0.0073,2.181,4.838,3.9588,1.1747,2.0351,3.6527,3.2915,2.3293,2.6698,5.04,1.7458,6.3141,2.2962,5.2734,2.4271,2.9907,4.9004,2.3544,5.8394,0.3958,3.3536,2.7764,5.2177,0.1109,0.5731,0.4379,4.468,0.0005,2.7864,2.8909,1.7449,0.9684,5.1648,2.2152,0.0013,2.6452,0.7103,0.0887,1.1668,3.3105,0.0008,1.6443,0.2335,2.3033,1.5627,3.8119,2.2314,5.0394,0.707,3.9438,6.5365,2.6822,1.8776,2.7442,1.7622,3.4226,3.5686,2.5072,0.0111,1.6754,5.9771,1.4001,4.001,3.6918,4.7084,1.1905,0.7804,0.0775,0.4784,0.8292,0.0001,4.5901,1.6921,5.5005,0.6812,4.8041,4.755,2.3223,3.8223,1.9052,2.5698,2.4738,2.4125,5.9885,1.6857,3.138,0.0168,0.949,0.9323,5.2464,5.5841,5.8444,1.1134,3.7676,0.0262,4.3937,3.2804,1.5816,0.9775,3.7846,0.2462,4.4226,0.2777,3.9474,1.0405,0.6376,2.6096,1.3923,4.5826,0.9309,5.041,0.1753,5.681,2.3305,1.8034,5.5732,2.7948,2.6725,1.459,1.1609,2.3147,4.4559,1.4592,3.2563,2.2751,4.3268,4.1162,0.9057,3.7043,2.8364,0.3402,2.9359,5.2128,0.0007,1.7877,0.1799,3.3343,1.1964,2.5193,2.423,5.4817,1.101,1.4406,0.5148,0.0001,4.2733,6.1989,0.5237,4.1541,0.8245,0.0109,0.2201,1.3347,3.7853,4.6776,3.5491,4.3146,4.8143,2.1911,0.0557,4.2639,5.6328,3.8707,0.9039,5.6479,1.261,3.5146,2.2444,2.0465,1.9601,2.3351,3.4895,3.8119,1.1091,2.3098,1.2649,2.1391,0.2439,5.4672,4.7797,1.1759,2.9134,2.024,3.022,6.1456,1.2768,1.4102,5.6585,1.7779,2.2375,1.9103,0.021,0.2628,0.6662,0.0002,4.3643,3.8241,2.7836,3.6671,0.113]}

It turns out there is a lot of space on the left side so for some reason people who like to go left can't decide from your journey to get there.","token_len":288,"entropy":[2.8999,6.104,6.3627,1.4096,0.1077,2.8795,6.4755,6.1373,2.6539,1.6968,5.9569,2.4252,5.6276,5.4385,4.4397,0.4207,2.5054,3.3574,0.2726,9.7892,2.9119,0.0093,2.9316,4.6614,1.9405,1.1724,0.0067,10.086,3.7484,1.5996,5.8072,1.5889,3.2015,0.7521,3.7079,5.8927,11.1676,2.8337,13.6122,6.6324,9.8617,4.6695,7.3835,3.5263,3.2489,1.2415,0.2592,3.8458,5.5979,2.2036,4.4789,0.1745,1.0482,7.2338,1.7135,2.117,6.7915,4.3396,0.8756,4.1624,3.9243,5.4801,6.0862,0.5912,4.5063,3.7704,1.865,1.6473,4.7223,1.2933,4.9452,5.8403,2.9427,0.8039,3.2053,4.9647,3.0812,0.7325,5.0166,0.055,2.087,4.8719,4.5736,0.6966,0.1059,0.7088,5.8442,5.6381,4.9885,0.7058,4.3404,2.1871,3.227,2.991,1.7526,2.9865,2.5121,3.4358,1.9734,4.564,0.6653,0.7593,4.9711,3.7667,3.9758,1.6681,2.164,0.3139,1.4854,0.0003,0.1934,4.8463,1.3475,5.2138,1.0699,0.5328,6.505,1.939,0.3549,3.4647,5.1731,1.0188,0.7959,0.6072,4.0319,5.8758,3.6167,3.2397,6.2425,1.3655,1.652,3.2347,0.6175,1.9462,0.5791,3.6114,0.3388,2.9412,4.6553,0.8655,2.9916,5.3856,3.9698,0.9381,5.8512,0.6982,4.8245,0.5256,4.2177,1.6872,2.5493,2.9903,3.0673,5.9185,1.79,3.0163,3.8342,1.0024,0.7185,2.9986,4.0292,5.5273,3.9506,1.0158,2.3722,2.6978,5.7975,2.9378,2.4128,1.114,5.42,5.0758,3.9745,2.296,0.8988,1.53,5.5531,2.3775,3.3476,4.9767,3.3792,0.191,5.6169,1.7998,0.8422,4.4137,0.6763,4.4445,5.4963,4.9119,1.7259,0.4501,0.8004,0.0002,0.025,4.4657,1.7314,5.6057,2.0176,3.3255,2.2102,1.3662,4.3121,1.4845,3.9234,2.1427,0.7381,5.0781,1.1014,4.1792,2.0488,1.3311,0.1663,1.2978,3.5088,2.1446,1.6952,0.5999,5.3939,4.1324,0.0867,1.5044,4.1212,2.4701,0.1835,1.629,3.4343,0.0405,0.9353,4.4322,3.4418,3.1025,4.031,0.562,1.1718,1.7877,0.2993,4.1449,4.8595,3.8056,2.9229,4.2467,3.2861,2.4406,5.7371,7.3793,2.3249,0.5715,2.3718,1.3332,4.8043,3.3938,0.157,0.7861,3.4786,6.8068,0.0689,2.7606,0.819,0.9371,2.6944,0.4055,3.3072,2.1401,0.2386,1.5531,0.2117,1.7916,4.0533,2.5026,1.426,3.192,3.2698,3.8274,0.6438,0.7615,1.5757,2.9549,2.1559,5.452,5.2628,6.4879,5.4128,2.6704,3.1618,1.491,0.5598]}

When we do, it will show us how we can make our life easy and comfortable for ourselves.","token_len":289,"entropy":[10.1396,4.2322,1.9358,3.3157,13.0286,12.6491,4.3085,5.8432,3.7807,8.7231,2.4619,4.6,0.5336,4.4549,0.6895,4.3588,7.5297,9.9074,4.1061,6.6311,1.358,1.0697,5.3682,0.9401,1.6148,4.7537,9.7077,4.0681,2.0338,0.6164,9.5557,0.8101,2.3163,6.4757,1.5032,2.3196,0.0752,3.2892,2.3893,2.8419,1.1535,4.5786,5.6735,2.9352,0.0267,1.4457,3.6823,1.1822,1.6752,0.6681,0.0003,2.3441,2.2516,5.0034,2.7667,0.9125,1.812,3.28,1.7982,5.3642,0.4937,2.0947,3.1927,4.3604,5.4532,0.7577,0.8987,0.5868,0.058,4.6262,4.2071,1.8557,1.9976,0.2711,2.259,1.3729,1.3739,2.0523,1.6594,5.8787,4.964,1.1226,1.5119,2.0894,3.0729,6.1778,0.9402,0.3802,3.9591,1.4456,5.8669,0.0459,2.943,5.2175,4.4009,3.0286,1.59,5.7541,2.2819,4.1562,3.3933,4.3383,3.4851,1.6736,2.2886,4.1137,0.1485,3.7111,5.0934,2.7281,4.8183,4.1966,0.4409,4.9223,0.8732,2.9975,2.75,2.3686,1.689,1.8191,2.8244,4.974,1.4597,2.2942,0.5627,1.0218,0.4105,1.3428,5.0427,2.3097,1.223,4.7521,0.5332,4.6456,5.605,1.315,3.1305,4.6822,0.197,4.8912,0.9279,0.2824,0.7659,0.0004,3.3112,4.753,1.4769,0.0612,3.9722,2.7411,4.9425,3.6458,3.0202,0.9271,1.8735,3.6148,2.5378,4.5275,0.6874,4.3143,0.8639,2.7547,3.2474,4.8944,2.9605,1.9084,5.6946,3.1945,0.3775,2.8318,2.1319,2.6744,1.9531,0.5773,6.034,2.1182,0.0422,2.068,3.5089,4.3018,5.5737,0.5112,1.5263,1.9534,0.0003,3.2304,4.3925,0.8168,4.0289,0.463,3.6292,5.1399,1.693,1.9707,2.0109,5.0835,0.5111,5.2186,2.0314,2.8934,1.9606,4.5477,5.2481,0.0012,2.9125,3.5437,1.0081,6.9842,0.0057,0.3645,1.9472,3.8504,1.4811,1.9098,0.0477,1.3372,4.9173,0.1425,1.5988,5.0971,0.2075,3.4272,0.3664,0.8623,2.2735,0.0194,4.3883,2.0534,5.3533,0.3339,3.0482,2.5161,0.7843,0.8542,0.6182,0.5535,2.9945,1.3073,2.0243,0.2311,4.5572,1.3481,5.0626,0.7361,5.736,5.2228,0.1865,1.5189,0.0517,0.8473,0.8301,0.0687,0.2564,0.2756,0.672,4.3935,2.1225,2.4147,0.2543,2.7572,1.5788,1.6592,3.5217,0.0366,1.466,1.2471,1.9234,2.3464,5.4676,0.6193,4.2188,3.0333,2.8052,1.386,4.4681,0.2296,2.0794,1.7926,0.5232,2.5728,1.6721,1.7748,5.0859,1.0594,3.145,1.5489,1.0979,1.3861]}

The unidentified man is said to have left a string of posts on Facebook that call for the return of the children for any future crime.\n\nHe appears to have been working alongside his comrades to kill members of the local community.\n\nHere is the police report posted in the local paper:\n\nA police officer, who died suddenly during the operation, is reported to have died from an apparent gunshot wound to the abdomen.\n\nA post on a local news website has said the deceased man was reported by a police officer as a person of interest in the disappearance of three girls from the small village of Kukorot.\n\nWe are hoping that there might be a good way to get contact to those who have lost their loved ones.\n\nOne question still remains \u2013 what did these young people have to 'just want money'?","token_len":299,"entropy":[9.4201,6.484,0.1035,2.9699,10.7594,4.2403,3.8574,3.2739,6.5679,1.6064,1.5028,1.5091,6.0467,1.1238,0.0324,6.3108,7.9694,1.1088,2.6802,0.5954,2.3656,5.8474,7.6799,1.5728,2.5521,0.8346,6.2589,3.2844,3.3431,11.2439,1.6326,1.4217,6.2764,1.9585,1.2934,3.0159,6.3169,0.2136,9.5099,0.0014,0.8036,2.5881,0.0342,5.6363,0.0785,4.9582,2.3919,2.7722,0.2054,2.9787,3.2616,3.1824,0.0296,0.8129,4.3525,2.9638,4.2875,2.5386,4.9537,1.9101,1.4054,1.7933,1.9503,4.1461,0.5845,3.3951,3.9427,2.603,3.9025,1.0179,3.5585,0.7326,1.4838,0.0004,5.4846,5.2699,3.4066,5.2511,1.231,0.9741,5.5433,3.7737,3.6531,1.5597,4.5996,5.9572,4.6071,1.0448,5.5111,0.0025,0.8683,2.3524,1.7767,0.8478,3.7937,6.018,1.2128,1.7503,5.7766,0.8725,3.8849,0.1385,2.2057,5.7023,1.6459,1.6899,0.0003,3.4967,1.509,2.5501,0.173,7.326,0.0002,2.7354,3.1652,2.2502,6.0291,0.1023,4.5589,3.3581,5.6905,0.6791,3.398,4.9962,2.454,0.7622,0.0231,1.4075,2.2146,5.5789,0.3024,2.3252,2.3467,0.0077,0.5976,3.8797,1.3684,6.1135,0.0291,5.3598,0.9385,2.1926,2.4139,5.7835,0.7618,1.5179,3.1926,0.0191,1.1931,1.0231,5.753,5.1322,4.0142,3.8766,0.6739,0.9218,0.0002,3.8418,5.1655,0.0578,0.3305,1.4408,5.1612,6.4306,3.0353,5.9359,3.1111,3.5367,6.0935,0.0323,0.4191,0.8622,2.2717,0.7406,1.0376,0.0002,6.0908,0.5827,1.2258,4.6208,2.509,5.4279,3.7201,1.4193,2.224,1.779,1.4732,0.1106,0.0002,2.6251,3.604,0.9697,3.332,1.067,6.0405,4.6234,4.0966,1.5287,3.196,0.9072,2.6056,2.0219,0.3917,0.1245,3.0758,2.1179,2.7229,1.1627,1.7126,0.0454,0.9877,0.2849,3.3076,0.3992,1.4178,0.0002,2.3561,3.98,0.6637,2.2538,1.5545,2.3732,0.9703,2.5219,3.5184,1.8182,3.5705,1.5385,1.3316,4.272,3.0544,1.5886,3.6139,0.7539,1.9178,2.258,4.0392,0.6243,0.0763,1.3826,0.5853,2.6224,0.1721,4.3032,3.2189,1.9172,1.6924,5.3473,1.08,0.1827,3.5535,5.025,5.195,5.5053,1.5971,0.4207,0.0002,5.1617,1.8169,5.4244,0.8664,4.2766,4.8275,0.2849,1.714,4.473,4.8069,0.6085,3.3922,5.9916,2.8495,3.6661,1.2794,1.4492,3.2452,0.5199,1.8196,0.0285,0.8712,0.7673,0.0003,5.3112,5.5377,5.1355,0.6888,3.8327,1.8019,3.4103,2.2122,3.2492,1.1805,2.3234,0.7757,8.3702,4.6387,4.6736,6.9893,1.6264]}

Use the Pet Alert Program to learn more.","token_len":300,"entropy":[9.0534,10.0442,3.8307,5.6508,4.3267,0.5542,1.3186,7.3702,0.2382,0.0051,3.0931,1.6834,13.6157,12.1872,6.3346,4.8166,4.7034,3.3161,1.9061,0.0023,2.4388,1.9785,1.342,8.7812,1.306,0.5097,10.5006,6.4373,6.9375,5.027,2.2422,6.6854,0.7992,6.0885,0.0868,0.0117,2.7189,2.5711,5.4577,0.027,6.6652,4.0631,2.4051,0.0248,6.8295,3.4564,0.0025,0.0057,0.0006,0.0005,0.0008,0.001,0.0036,0.0015,0.001,0.0008,3.0422,0.5528,4.3324,1.4643,3.7448,1.1734,1.3978,3.8385,4.4095,2.3943,2.5376,0.2188,3.9838,3.95,0.3399,3.6896,1.6707,3.753,3.5848,2.6885,4.097,5.1557,0.4075,6.1282,1.6725,4.8377,2.8754,0.8717,3.1669,0.8396,2.0631,0.7505,0.4266,5.4526,2.677,0.7741,0.0001,7.8798,0.4918,0.0026,0.0096,0.0009,0.005,0.0071,0.0008,0.001,0.0128,0.0014,0.0018,0.0025,0.0005,0.0007,0.0011,0.0002,0.0036,0.0011,0.0252,0.0007,1.3355,0.3036,2.0968,4.7939,0.3916,5.7645,4.3319,0.195,6.4992,0.2524,5.2822,0.0543,0.7712,2.6834,2.4048,4.0341,2.9486,6.0997,2.9324,2.0454,5.2798,1.9293,2.6742,5.1296,4.288,4.6149,6.7383,4.7736,0.3977,2.2062,2.0021,0.004,4.1466,1.4123,3.4317,2.4975,1.7309,3.5472,2.7433,0.1934,1.0854,3.8587,6.2197,4.4821,4.1664,0.2259,2.7771,1.3113,1.0334,1.6732,0.0002,4.9164,0.0526,0.0006,0.0199,0.6595,0.0054,0.0021,0.0023,0.0017,0.0016,0.0007,0.0038,0.1732,0.0027,0.0029,0.0093,0.0008,0.0006,0.0007,0.1354,0.0006,0.0008,0.0017,0.0034,0.0006,0.0027,0.0005,0.0053,0.0003,0.0004,0.0008,0.0002,0.0011,0.0044,0.0006,1.3167,1.6503,0.5381,0.9641,4.1999,1.8319,4.2523,0.1933,3.1295,0.8537,1.5192,5.1363,3.6825,1.6644,2.2349,1.9075,1.5166,1.4554,1.3158,1.522,2.7433,1.5226,1.7865,3.5371,0.1402,1.6747,1.1467,0.7285,4.5033,1.519,1.9904,1.2711,1.2832,3.4543,1.206,4.3174,3.826,0.0213,5.2692,3.6553,0.8038,2.9827,4.2284,0.646,5.3575,5.0404,7.2446,0.1605,1.7256,2.1746,0.5911,3.2435,1.2748,0.3327,0.5547,2.591,0.8214,1.983,1.7364,0.3348,4.4847,3.1046,1.6353,0.2258,4.064,2.4069,2.56,1.1474,2.5748,4.2112,4.7222,3.3337,1.5526,4.1013,1.6833,1.4203,1.7225,0.2881,2.9028,1.4871,0.75,4.2261,4.5071,0.0042,3.598,2.3427,2.8499,1.6673,0.7353,6.4284,6.2503,1.1997,2.7302,5.8038,4.3211,1.1598,4.0397,0.917,1.3506]}

The scene was so important in the series, it was used in the episode \"The Man Who Hates Richard\" by Gene Hackman.\n\nEpisode 6.6 \"Worms in the Fellsow Hole\" (1987)","token_len":305,"entropy":[2.6222,5.191,3.8006,0.7489,8.4221,0.8916,0.3345,3.7978,9.8646,4.1777,2.4576,2.9518,5.1104,4.175,10.1621,0.3261,1.0063,8.7695,3.2812,3.9874,1.1207,0.0005,2.6262,3.955,1.0664,0.3775,4.5117,0.9793,3.4761,3.2811,1.8301,5.1884,1.7251,1.0577,1.4056,0.1117,2.6404,4.831,4.3404,5.1087,4.4407,4.3649,5.7078,0.0754,1.3584,5.5268,5.2272,2.0589,5.5383,0.0091,4.2578,1.6245,5.1763,2.365,4.5255,3.3831,5.9299,2.8985,5.1325,0.3011,5.3901,0.2239,3.4285,1.1678,5.0757,2.7778,0.2853,6.22,4.3378,4.9871,0.9206,0.6926,6.5098,1.3327,1.8609,0.2905,6.39,3.043,1.3605,0.2383,4.0791,1.6625,0.4721,2.5167,3.4058,1.0651,4.6817,2.3563,0.9119,2.54,4.935,5.0673,1.6538,2.9306,6.1327,0.8788,2.4534,3.3656,5.2072,4.613,3.8274,0.4506,3.5068,0.9353,3.3912,5.2889,0.8317,1.9807,2.2277,1.151,4.4377,1.6442,0.6765,5.8585,1.7481,1.6672,2.0628,4.5938,4.3346,6.1982,3.324,3.6376,2.4015,2.6442,3.8618,3.4934,5.1411,2.8326,2.1888,4.7854,2.8863,6.0744,0.7529,4.5599,0.6694,3.1781,4.9236,2.8785,4.8206,3.1836,3.8971,6.4985,3.6103,0.905,1.5407,5.966,1.5711,0.0002,5.8674,3.2864,3.6721,3.6626,3.3921,1.9824,4.6864,0.859,3.0043,3.1419,3.9935,0.5263,2.551,4.9432,0.2329,0.5864,0.0002,2.3873,2.2505,2.0018,4.7115,4.414,3.259,0.0328,3.107,4.7614,3.0248,4.0137,2.06,0.345,4.1,5.707,5.485,3.0271,4.7782,3.1849,0.5621,2.3702,2.3563,0.167,2.2262,4.4469,0.0463,0.0053,1.0656,3.253,0.7903,0.2209,0.0496,5.5703,2.7807,6.5151,0.754,5.4189,5.3853,2.7044,0.3112,5.967,5.2783,1.4024,3.1733,6.3811,6.0997,2.9077,0.063,1.3216,4.3603,3.3698,2.1286,0.587,0.3859,0.0689,1.0954,0.0024,0.7943,1.1037,3.2821,0.0197,0.0035,2.5563,2.1416,2.1183,2.45,0.7358,1.5646,4.6503,1.4962,2.9234,2.8361,4.9125,1.0263,4.7475,3.4226,3.1778,2.5642,3.8958,1.3853,5.349,5.1057,1.8584,1.71,1.8364,5.1251,0.3346,1.1648,1.8959,0.4647,0.9249,2.0454,1.8598,1.6295,4.9793,3.5604,2.4924,0.6512,2.6861,2.3427,1.7385,1.0256,2.5475,1.2204,1.1946,3.2051,0.7389,0.8226,0.3483,0.0564,0.4084,0.0008,0.1434,1.1403,3.9814,5.4197,1.8728,0.0005,1.4128,0.7796,0.0002,2.6768,0.1528,0.022,2.6348,0.612,5.6423,4.641,1.2217,3.1337,0.8905,5.5279,4.4595,5.0787,5.4011,0.0705,0.0651,4.3782,0.0621]}

Greg created a small sci-fi epic published in his own work called Star Trek: Adventures in New Frontier: The Battle of Endor (originally known as Star Trek: Voyager). Greg gave a synopsis of the novel from DS9 and explained the story. He left part of it there. The following year, he adapted a second novel published by his friends at Rippis Press. This time, Greg took this same idea and added a new cover for the third volume.\n\n\nIn 2015, the series was pulled from CBS.

If that magical bullet doesn't work, you just might even die of it.","token_len":315,"entropy":[3.0338,3.7921,1.1743,5.6272,0.8018,5.2213,6.9774,1.8493,6.7042,2.2386,0.5733,5.4692,0.0336,1.1457,1.0246,2.7522,1.4846,2.7094,5.3781,1.1084,2.0828,0.0033,3.9675,1.1486,6.5056,3.1659,0.9878,3.9098,4.3641,0.8955,2.3389,2.1494,6.5716,0.8743,0.7324,0.0001,4.7365,5.7441,3.4139,5.3508,3.9155,2.7533,2.8542,4.563,2.3439,4.7217,1.7976,3.7437,5.1693,2.4147,0.9553,0.9589,4.0537,0.8191,5.3052,5.225,6.6865,2.5508,1.9818,4.6741,0.9671,0.1813,3.4065,3.7902,0.59,3.1431,5.3273,2.803,4.4682,5.3103,1.8136,0.329,2.2851,2.5769,1.009,1.9629,0.1837,2.7725,2.285,1.43,1.8764,5.2781,3.1094,3.1065,0.2731,0.0002,3.9427,3.438,2.2705,4.2712,2.7589,3.4695,5.4816,3.1912,0.4304,3.4896,1.8778,3.5223,4.0683,0.057,1.0255,3.7268,0.2704,2.0845,4.0021,0.1828,0.9557,5.9309,2.068,5.6284,2.196,4.1897,3.7029,2.2001,0.023,0.2749,2.4888,0.8962,0.6363,0.0002,3.6072,4.7844,1.1704,3.4387,0.5553,0.7913,0.1632,2.6621,1.9489,1.0254,1.937,1.6305,2.7616,2.2932,0.0263,0.2373,7.2344,1.1587,5.0283,0.9197,5.5786,1.6204,1.9023,2.6564,0.0005,0.6451,3.0382,0.6849,2.1222,0.5507,0.7953,0.0002,4.3365,5.6883,2.927,0.1594,5.2207,0.1542,5.133,4.582,1.7829,3.1424,5.8165,2.3959,0.0001,5.3655,1.9806,2.1582,1.8428,1.6982,4.3868,4.5284,3.5197,1.2151,3.0204,2.8037,4.16,0.9549,2.0582,1.5528,3.2863,4.2985,1.6226,3.0665,0.9409,1.5187,0.3577,0.0017,3.5194,1.5058,3.8985,0.6372,3.7736,2.7623,1.6908,0.0069,2.1372,0.0787,2.1007,5.2107,1.0773,2.3574,0.2836,5.3836,0.0104,3.6888,0.5295,0.0136,0.4189,1.1325,2.5246,2.56,3.137,0.0047,3.0392,2.0266,0.3647,0.3566,0.0002,2.1227,2.7914,0.5073,5.4572,5.0125,1.6343,1.9726,2.1756,3.1295,2.9032,2.5957,5.5597,0.0459,0.9906,0.139,5.0098,0.3956,2.2342,3.2427,2.4773,4.5535,1.0967,5.5886,2.0646,0.8252,1.5733,1.5446,4.5152,2.7998,2.7862,4.7326,0.4413,0.0717,0.8954,0.4594,0.0001,4.9813,4.743,1.4696,0.0062,1.9842,1.5925,5.8663,0.2375,1.6107,3.8238,0.414,1.6582,3.1233,1.1067,2.9372,5.7166,5.4277,4.8895,0.1898,0.3893,1.9744,2.3531,4.3924,1.0869,3.2602,3.788,2.4879,1.0549,5.6202,2.8502,1.9954,1.3182,0.8317,3.2699,0.5355,1.034,0.5647,0.5585,3.4614,4.1416,1.4954,2.2366,2.0472,4.4897,4.3606,5.1015,0.1559,4.5564,0.0002,0.3622,0.3186,1.3978,4.0463,1.6447,6.4694,1.3207,2.2744,0.5073,0.2954]}

'\n\n\nIt goes without saying that most of our people have never heard of the Kratom class and we are not interested in that topic. However, we could add a few other points to those.\n\nKratom has had its use for millennia and is the most widely consumed drug in America. Its main health benefits include:\n\n\n- Anti-aging protection\n\n- Antioxidant \/ anti-bio-nutrients\n\n- Anti-inflammatory and antifungal \/ anti-toxicity effects\n\n- Anti-cancer protective effects\n\n\nFor any one of those features, there's a price to pay. We are the only company offering products like Kratom that can be sold on a wholesale basis in your community, and the value you can get with it increases with volume. We think it's the difference between buying a coffee made in Oregon and being able to keep your entire savings, or saving up any number of small purchases to give you a sense of where to put your kratom.\n\nWe encourage your members to purchase Kratom directly from them where they want one. Our shop has been in the business for over 25 years and now there are so many people looking to put their kratom in their local grocery store - no more expensive or expensive than buying the same product over and over again. They could never live as they did before.\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you.

Their body is totally inert because of the heat emitted by their tiny bodies, although those organs seem to be able to survive at about a hundred thousand degrees Celsius.\n\nEven though the body is relatively cool, its tissues are not and thus the conditions for life go away, and the body is less fertile, giving rise to other species, but no significant change whatsoever.\n\nIt is this that led the author to formulate the concepts of the Principle of Conservation of Growth on Earth for which he is a part, with which he believes that all life is organized:\n\nThe principle of conservation of growth is precisely what we have been aiming for, which makes it possible for all organisms to survive for as long as we want, and the principle of conservation will lead to far higher levels of abundance.\n\nWhat is interesting about this statement is that it goes against all previous scientific concepts. It turns out that in any case we need to get outside of space to explore new worlds, like Venus and Mars, where life is already abundant.\n\nNow we already know where the universe came from. When we get out of the ground, the universe has now grown beyond us. But our survival is dependent on where we are today, and we need to find those worlds very slowly and for at least a year.\n\nAnd that's as clear as day.\n\n(Source: Science Online)","token_len":321,"entropy":[7.4121,2.5141,7.1537,0.0393,4.5743,8.4332,0.1154,0.1365,2.3285,7.0364,2.9722,2.9051,4.4604,4.3972,0.7712,10.5004,1.6073,1.8713,2.1117,1.7252,5.4023,2.0446,7.8394,2.3668,1.1844,0.5005,1.6015,0.0023,4.5128,0.071,4.5039,2.0754,5.0632,0.3823,3.3592,4.1898,0.002,2.0234,0.5435,3.9761,4.3151,1.7142,5.7165,5.7126,5.0476,1.5678,1.0341,5.8566,5.3639,0.5311,2.118,4.5085,2.0405,1.7699,6.1229,5.8611,4.2388,6.1598,0.298,1.1024,2.205,0.0103,2.2727,4.0822,4.0266,4.3281,2.7423,2.9832,0.8944,0.8206,0.8468,0.7934,0.0002,4.9729,2.2531,1.5938,2.447,1.0665,4.5429,3.7687,0.7188,3.2555,4.1724,0.9189,2.5198,5.6675,5.1554,2.6604,5.898,1.388,1.9987,6.0626,4.2879,2.8239,2.442,1.5108,2.0938,1.7757,5.1684,5.4102,2.227,5.1278,1.6891,0.0129,4.9097,4.5782,2.4868,5.1115,4.6822,4.9337,1.7222,4.4906,0.2551,0.4807,0.0002,3.6362,0.933,3.3507,4.0457,4.7713,2.2288,5.9543,0.7177,5.1471,1.1193,5.9721,0.5107,2.4409,6.3097,0.1068,3.4348,0.8378,5.7174,5.4396,2.8999,5.1538,3.4077,1.3742,1.4415,2.4237,2.9233,1.7432,4.6953,2.7484,0.3907,4.3702,1.2907,3.3851,1.4042,1.5244,5.4566,4.8653,0.7192,0.0001,2.0298,2.0187,0.218,0.2392,0.2765,0.1637,1.2059,6.2066,2.8944,1.7778,2.0603,1.9237,5.8567,0.5616,2.0769,3.1401,5.3594,1.1851,0.516,0.9425,1.7577,2.3404,0.4046,2.2163,2.9852,2.985,0.0415,0.0162,2.8603,1.7484,1.5063,1.446,4.0093,2.2108,0.29,0.8705,5.9521,3.4836,0.6537,5.2553,3.2373,1.7847,0.0268,4.3518,2.0853,0.5439,0.0003,4.2415,1.5706,4.3928,1.059,0.5998,4.1593,0.2029,0.1658,0.6709,4.5745,1.6163,3.1099,2.4741,2.7538,5.136,2.1082,2.666,6.0034,0.0304,0.1624,3.5384,5.4232,1.0466,3.7105,2.8425,0.6772,4.4484,5.4432,0.8733,4.8991,1.4603,4.9287,3.5811,2.3934,1.266,5.3807,3.6668,1.7426,0.5851,1.0402,2.5319,1.7805,1.3619,3.5094,3.1646,0.7213,0.6,0.0002,4.8136,2.9875,6.3227,0.5086,5.2216,2.2809,4.5436,3.3921,0.0198,1.5231,4.8847,0.9426,3.6363,2.7884,0.3035,1.3802,5.4209,0.5877,2.2889,3.334,3.3189,5.3912,3.4537,4.1475,3.5733,0.9687,3.4149,4.2491,5.2756,1.6707,3.0724,0.2236,4.2936,0.2843,0.8642,3.7744,1.2426,0.8935,2.1128,2.0847,0.2421,2.2607,5.8828,2.314,5.6512,4.3649,2.9541,4.4608,4.0008,0.0295,0.613,3.5575,1.1809,0.6206,0.0002,3.8356,2.2043,1.73,6.3189,5.8765,0.3816,1.507,0.7206,1.308,0.0002,4.5497,2.8031,0.3695,3.5404,4.8084,0.7262]}

Rather, these utopian utopiets were invented after being abandoned by mankind with the use of technology. There are a ton of reasons for why I would like to propose that the most effective ways to create the utopiets may be as: 1. The postapocalyptic utopiet created the first postapocalyptic utopiets, and are currently the only postapocalyptic utopia created. 2. The postapocalyptic utopiet created a postapocalyptic utopia that have been made by humans with the ability to use computers. This means that while I don't understand how the world will become so postapocalyptic that the machines will become more powerful, or how that will change how society will react, I hope that these utopifits will be created by the technology of the postapocalyptic utopiets. So while my idea is simple, the postapocalyptic utopiet is my life's dream utopia. The postapocalyptic utopiets are what is lost after being abandoned by humankind with the use of technologies.

A spacecraft carrying astronauts on their way home during the second world war will use radar to monitor the moon in this way.\n\nIf there's not enough evidence already to confirm extraterrestrial life, it has to be taken seriously. No one is sure where aliens were headed, even if aliens did move on Earth.\n\nOne question still remains: Why did these five people fly to their death? The answer may go beyond their obvious need to impress those who visited them the same way they got here.\n\nAnd that's as clear as day.\n\n(Source: NASA)","token_len":341,"entropy":[2.8999,10.5905,7.4926,1.4022,2.2348,4.0047,6.7571,2.6175,2.4419,2.4014,1.4422,7.1437,1.0909,5.2601,0.93,3.84,7.0873,3.7307,0.5741,3.7857,14.9483,8.616,3.5147,3.8019,6.9469,4.1135,2.3181,8.6245,0.1816,0.8828,5.65,11.8976,1.2896,7.5567,1.2335,1.667,3.8102,8.3253,0.8311,2.6143,4.8658,1.3429,6.8497,1.7801,0.8297,1.4623,0.8043,0.7848,0.0006,3.7857,3.724,1.4296,3.6075,1.9836,4.4294,1.8214,1.9894,0.3755,2.2678,2.0509,0.0085,5.2302,1.4417,4.1401,0.0421,5.9416,4.1373,2.5226,4.3812,5.0362,0.2823,6.0852,0.7938,0.8769,5.3934,3.5207,2.1676,5.2277,0.876,2.4696,4.1328,0.3568,3.1108,0.3017,4.0585,3.8418,5.7381,0.0166,2.37,1.7082,4.6034,1.6715,1.585,0.1217,6.7215,4.4841,5.594,1.6093,5.7345,4.3294,5.801,4.646,0.0562,0.5137,5.9518,4.3099,2.9957,1.2304,0.0276,0.0161,2.1157,2.5748,5.5941,0.2331,3.1019,2.1807,4.5551,4.5101,2.2379,3.9494,2.7729,0.7596,0.5213,0.0003,2.0383,4.3588,4.4633,0.1111,4.2197,4.6304,0.834,2.4415,4.8889,3.5616,4.8756,4.2801,2.5599,0.2266,6.0183,1.6018,5.4843,1.9571,2.4314,0.3076,4.9604,3.5669,3.5347,4.1323,0.0028,2.4852,4.7991,4.4857,3.3914,1.799,4.8236,2.0554,5.0422,3.4943,5.7143,0.001,5.8323,1.7717,3.6853,6.1775,4.2894,0.259,4.4842,4.4595,3.5747,1.4916,4.704,0.8272,3.2346,5.4192,4.5434,0.1274,3.1406,2.1355,1.7432,4.2841,1.7658,1.1323,2.7932,0.2906,2.4841,0.0335,2.3339,2.7243,4.7391,0.5584,4.1058,0.7355,3.3652,0.9275,4.8186,5.662,5.0107,1.2147,4.343,1.1632,1.3422,2.4918,1.0426,4.9367,5.8733,0.2529,0.213,4.8247,2.585,2.1827,2.0178,1.9185,2.9644,3.9314,0.4112,1.9648,1.1043,3.5539,0.3772,1.9638,2.1797,0.4267,5.1254,2.9006,5.2932,1.9605,3.1252,2.6994,0.5004,4.2666,7.1459,0.9563,5.7756,4.0282,0.0219,0.7539,3.6703,5.5459,0.5083,5.191,1.0909,3.0711,3.9101,4.6507,0.4111,0.4127,0.6297,0.0002,4.5263,3.4744,1.785,5.5846,1.0509,2.3385,4.9417,1.4314,2.7333,4.7372,0.3363,0.2008,0.3231,2.5857,4.4862,2.075,0.4679,3.609,0.3443,0.4654,5.5628,0.9927,2.2217,2.0016,3.0429,2.6885,3.5708,4.5497,1.6855,5.2118,1.2278,5.2523,4.0172,5.1967,1.5275,0.6811,0.7521,2.55,0.0002,4.7985,4.3047,4.23,1.4805,0.3119,2.4733,1.5788,3.235,4.6801,1.9016,4.5268,2.2006,5.3676,3.5601,1.2601,2.9955,1.4036,2.2957,6.3898,2.7157,2.8758,4.5289,4.0202,0.5295,4.4773,5.3656,2.0337,5.3043,1.504,6.5114,4.7948,0.1792,1.4142,5.8538,2.4645,0.3806,1.3144,0.0002,4.7906,2.7925,0.9186,6.0979,5.0888,0.8314,2.5917,0.6016,1.5055,0.0002,4.2542,4.7903,0.0269,1.6937,0.9558]}

But I feel so helpless that this has taken so much energy. It will leave no opportunity for me to look forward to the rest of my life. It has left me deeply depressed with hopelessness. I will miss my children, my love. I know what a loss it is to be a government employee and to have failed my children.\n\n\"But I am ready to stand up for myself and the American people.\n\n\"We believe that in a constitutional republic, free speech does not have to mean that the government should control you. This doesn't mean that any of you should be on the payroll. Not every citizen can. Not every person should run the American government. But citizens cannot sit in a jail room where the government is listening to their every word. The American people believe in the right of free expression.\n\n\"The American people are finally ready to voice their concerns and grievances with the people of California and California the United States over the injustice suffered by people like that two years ago. California is an open and free state, and our state will not be bullied by the federal government. If we don't get stronger, then our future lies in the hands of our citizens.\"","token_len":344,"entropy":[11.6259,6.9974,2.197,1.1978,3.4287,3.1029,5.6337,4.063,2.657,1.8449,6.449,1.3504,9.6368,4.7967,0.9855,0.2242,7.9636,2.986,0.2504,0.6984,1.1365,2.0766,0.0711,2.2758,3.4831,2.5154,3.8531,1.5678,5.0706,0.3236,1.4548,1.0419,4.2051,5.6728,0.0416,4.7236,1.5172,5.2747,1.4741,1.9244,3.0508,1.1431,4.563,0.1532,3.8567,0.0096,2.5667,1.1497,1.4714,4.0481,5.2809,1.5535,1.5436,4.6593,2.0188,4.4826,3.7137,2.0316,2.7177,1.5286,0.894,3.3396,1.7781,0.007,5.1662,1.8798,0.4461,0.9121,3.9266,2.734,3.644,0.0007,0.0834,1.3765,4.9614,3.4234,5.5105,3.0142,3.9049,4.1271,5.7426,5.5729,4.2309,6.4333,0.4723,3.2019,0.0002,0.0627,1.1647,2.994,2.3434,3.5218,2.4988,2.2594,3.1859,4.4343,2.2936,1.7434,2.1686,0.9442,0.6709,3.1951,1.6807,4.063,2.9248,3.5586,3.0477,3.8245,3.1479,2.5192,1.6346,1.6081,4.3797,1.9335,2.367,3.4393,7.9495,3.2846,5.6229,0.3458,0.6665,0.3592,5.1831,1.8972,0.2823,1.6315,4.0089,0.0215,0.0418,0.0571,0.5805,3.166,2.7328,1.1028,0.3572,5.3455,1.8073,6.1027,4.9861,0.2137,0.6693,1.3329,3.5829,4.3879,1.3498,2.7629,1.7059,0.5877,5.0281,2.3455,0.7189,3.5504,3.3532,3.2021,4.2901,1.0469,1.3353,0.8684,1.9415,2.5042,5.4638,0.5785,2.0239,1.8345,1.5401,4.446,2.7512,1.3706,0.5754,1.3037,0.0001,0.0233,2.6388,0.8672,1.8912,4.4023,0.4971,3.4924,0.6063,0.6835,1.1041,1.055,2.902,2.4077,0.1784,0.7247,2.2618,0.0001,0.0435,3.6778,5.6583,1.2564,4.2081,2.8646,5.8267,0.877,0.4609,5.2024,0.574,3.7111,0.0363,2.4513,0.2465,1.9216,3.5328,2.6807,0.4736,1.7348,3.2215,2.6125,0.5819,4.495,4.7811,0.0007,0.1417,0.4158,3.9314,2.4314,1.7533,0.8643,0.9405,5.6308,0.9643,1.6446,2.8278,5.3196,2.9976,2.5406,2.6545,3.7703,2.1784,0.1954,2.9827,1.9196,6.5866,2.241,4.8823,0.8153,0.2906,2.3419,5.9784,3.7662,4.6674,1.5741,2.2748,5.4095,4.1723,4.6678,2.0535,0.7368,2.1492,4.7353,0.3279,0.9373,1.5944,3.12,0.546,3.7275,1.7848,0.1493,4.177,1.102,2.0194,2.0846,0.6741,1.8381,2.9898,0.7804,0.9073,0.0001,0.0205,2.7349,1.4321,0.0905,2.2103,5.3851,3.2805,0.215,5.7131,0.1322,2.2659,1.4241,3.8398,3.0625,0.9397,4.6569,1.6558,5.4492,1.7561,3.4639,5.7754,1.403,0.0016,6.5208,0.9501,5.2838,5.5038,0.2335,4.4045,0.9548,6.2831,6.8757,0.8913,0.0029,0.3844,4.4316,1.3934,3.615,3.1245,1.3236,1.5368,0.812,2.3432,0.8863,3.6066,2.2705,4.2073,1.4894,1.4009,2.5363,1.5376,1.1771,2.1899,0.0161,0.6489,4.7947,1.5643,2.4028,0.0008,3.6795,5.1604,0.7761,3.7389,2.7311,4.1418,3.6297,0.4603,1.3052,0.1605,0.0007,2.6026,1.478,1.915]}

The other women, like her daughter, play a crucial role in the story and she has a great sense of humor. The only character she doesn't like is her daughter, though, so she does have some serious things to say and is actually very amusing.\n\nA group of high school girls are struggling to cope with the loss of their dad and the new life they have together. The story centers around their son, who is now a very normal young man who is on a train, and who is fighting with a killer. The girl in his coma is a high school girl with long blonde hair and a dark red eyeshadow style, her face contorted with terror and sadness, but she also keeps the school spirit alive and is never hurt.\n\nI can't argue that this isn't the ending for this TV show. It's the second half of a seven part Season 2, with a great mix of themes and character development. As for some of the other characters who are involved, it's quite a journey. From the beginning, the characters are very young characters who have some issues of their own, so it's hard to feel confident about these young people. This is why we watch these young people, and they end up having those issues very slowly and they end up in this world because of it.\n\nI watched the first three parts of Game of Thrones this past episode. It was a little crazy, but the core cast is very interesting and I have a happy feeling that they're going to be a big part in this story.\n\nShare On Facebook Tweet Pin It Email","token_len":351,"entropy":[12.0487,10.0285,1.245,1.2213,6.9287,0.1314,3.5099,5.8167,2.829,3.0315,6.2383,12.4655,0.0983,3.2153,2.0409,3.0904,4.7002,4.625,4.932,4.4936,0.5077,2.745,5.44,0.0117,4.3769,0.7371,3.4526,5.1122,4.2048,3.4133,3.9304,2.9713,5.1749,0.835,5.0239,1.3393,2.9799,0.1641,0.2563,1.1684,1.0986,2.556,4.1924,2.6756,1.521,3.2586,2.3754,0.0399,0.2982,0.9751,2.6855,2.9577,4.2738,2.8434,1.799,0.0009,1.6628,0.2842,1.8928,2.8694,1.149,4.5981,1.8503,2.5243,1.0369,4.0483,1.9274,2.3359,4.0253,5.2738,0.4249,0.3692,3.1479,2.9587,4.9828,2.3495,5.4628,0.6282,1.6955,0.0285,4.3222,5.1404,0.0451,4.8673,0.1297,1.5249,2.1984,4.952,0.8524,3.4761,0.0788,1.0712,2.7966,0.0197,0.3333,4.6044,1.6641,2.7574,4.5562,2.7091,1.0778,1.6366,3.9483,0.5263,2.1367,3.5705,4.0009,0.0714,2.9926,5.3064,1.0326,1.5034,1.159,3.2509,1.9541,4.746,4.2893,2.7742,0.1739,2.0467,1.6426,4.6837,1.3548,5.7626,2.96,1.729,3.386,1.3954,5.0922,2.6597,2.0124,6.0943,2.2275,1.5565,2.8347,2.5803,4.6078,5.2599,1.0801,2.5401,4.3837,0.0476,0.9121,3.0382,5.2252,2.5418,0.0192,1.1057,1.5739,4.5349,2.8236,2.2443,3.5269,0.0074,5.5,1.7356,4.9651,2.6513,4.9125,0.3958,1.6691,5.4336,1.5082,3.155,2.9452,2.7898,1.1206,2.6509,5.7816,2.8293,4.848,2.2816,0.6755,1.8879,2.5839,5.9109,3.9692,0.7548,1.6608,0.0002,4.1082,3.6682,0.4499,6.2371,2.0357,1.3015,4.424,0.0003,2.5349,5.8779,2.3136,2.028,6.0899,0.6308,0.5981,1.3614,0.7262,1.8546,5.5013,1.6859,0.2142,1.9061,5.7822,2.4714,5.7306,1.2776,1.9643,2.6399,2.02,4.6457,4.0815,0.026,5.5331,0.8873,3.5987,0.5176,0.7024,4.4351,3.5078,5.4843,0.447,0.0738,1.9042,1.0993,3.3198,1.6147,3.3817,0.8444,2.2362,0.4628,4.3838,1.9536,5.2047,1.5291,5.5282,1.0313,3.0048,0.8893,1.748,2.3288,1.24,2.9042,3.8037,4.177,1.193,1.804,4.1515,3.4761,3.6794,0.278,0.0042,0.9847,3.9327,1.7701,0.5055,2.8692,0.197,5.5502,4.8311,1.7805,4.8926,4.5881,1.1195,0.8793,3.9013,0.9369,5.0506,3.5276,5.0781,3.3507,3.2452,0.8387,2.254,1.3597,2.8849,5.2118,0.0261,3.119,6.1859,1.6077,4.6219,3.4456,2.0104,2.9574,1.7912,0.0061,3.2351,3.1242,2.2294,4.599,1.1011,1.7983,0.1243,0.8316,0.0002,2.5995,4.6982,1.3948,0.9822,3.1851,2.9307,0.4599,7.1927,0.1941,0.0097,3.9696,2.7138,5.8453,1.9069,1.7972,0.8,1.5464,4.6878,5.2061,1.7628,0.7829,2.7841,5.5682,4.4638,2.1288,2.1975,2.2903,1.0694,2.3608,4.3955,2.1862,6.698,1.5411,0.8756,1.5152,1.9989,1.3001,0.0417,1.3674,2.6768,2.0058,0.0436,2.6266,1.1806,2.8553,0.3342,1.5592,0.0002,5.5721,1.116,0.0059,0.0003,0.0,0.0028,0.0]}

The people in church, the people out there who look at the world like we will only become a little more connected when the gospel takes shape, are my brothers and sisters.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http:\/\/usat.ly\/1MYdV8d","token_len":357,"entropy":[3.8828,2.7333,4.6531,11.3596,2.8463,1.2975,7.8613,0.0542,5.0792,1.5955,7.31,6.7882,3.5056,2.4095,2.1065,0.8575,5.8741,3.0938,9.7817,2.0358,6.9004,2.8296,4.6955,5.7951,6.5861,1.1227,6.5615,6.7794,2.1552,4.0871,3.1953,5.052,1.7881,2.8108,1.3824,3.3232,1.678,4.3128,2.3431,2.7896,2.9151,0.218,2.3585,4.8907,4.2427,1.4249,4.5932,6.3272,1.423,2.0197,4.0808,1.0955,5.074,1.0505,1.6972,0.4253,2.4278,1.502,2.4467,0.8266,4.9408,1.7337,3.2086,4.4059,0.0074,1.8871,0.5679,0.0018,5.2213,4.3941,3.2642,3.0272,2.8992,2.3337,4.3355,1.7662,6.5377,1.3443,0.8324,4.7462,5.6865,1.3537,3.0142,4.035,4.6737,1.6715,5.0625,1.3661,0.9536,0.0003,4.9831,0.6869,1.3438,3.4233,0.7498,2.2049,1.7087,2.7399,4.8353,1.149,2.0956,0.5285,0.0002,4.8775,1.2138,1.0165,2.7312,3.5328,1.4089,1.8559,0.0048,5.1412,3.2144,3.9489,3.5727,2.3809,1.9807,2.6593,3.5749,2.9339,0.4412,3.3788,2.0272,1.9667,3.2627,0.0009,2.0489,3.6818,1.5823,3.6653,3.9031,0.3851,0.956,4.814,3.2578,2.6543,0.4009,5.0803,0.5203,0.6638,5.1058,5.9544,2.8269,4.058,1.7416,1.0174,0.1812,2.0927,4.5558,3.6081,3.3967,0.5083,3.2113,0.878,1.5194,4.7321,5.4358,1.33,1.2216,2.7254,2.4005,2.2657,2.4229,3.3414,0.3547,2.614,1.2563,3.8593,0.1226,0.1324,0.144,0.0002,1.0235,1.3051,2.3804,1.3007,1.7874,5.6362,0.0629,3.123,1.228,4.1026,0.4992,0.8927,0.2539,0.1103,4.4491,1.7547,3.893,1.9842,0.5291,4.5687,0.0088,2.9801,1.3594,1.1022,2.1331,2.7918,1.9602,5.8469,1.8976,1.7091,2.585,1.354,3.0172,4.2132,0.6997,3.4551,1.5696,4.8037,0.0916,1.6053,3.7373,2.4976,2.3737,0.2833,2.3329,0.9458,1.5337,2.531,5.614,0.0672,4.3978,2.3578,0.3868,2.9143,3.4329,0.9311,5.8846,0.2339,3.966,2.0784,1.9452,0.2346,2.161,3.5963,1.0018,2.4176,1.8357,0.0002,0.1019,5.4483,1.9513,0.4314,4.2274,3.7079,1.8852,3.2564,1.113,2.4104,5.5447,4.2333,1.501,1.5828,4.0058,1.7466,1.5453,4.6825,0.8007,2.7642,4.8228,6.8967,3.6885,5.287,2.7021,5.1848,3.8485,2.7107,0.7428,2.7361,3.0828,1.5021,2.0219,0.8557,5.8836,1.0588,5.7722,5.9932,1.6789,0.2474,3.7925,1.2241,3.0979,2.8362,2.6523,0.543,3.6291,4.5718,0.9975,3.6183,2.6178,0.6554,2.1884,0.0074,1.3726,0.9503,5.1056,0.7187,0.5568,0.473,1.7642,3.2879,3.2552,2.7139,5.5109,3.3383,1.4734,0.9795,2.9851,0.4518,1.8655,5.9455,2.0376,1.6699,1.251,3.9097,2.0291,6.2868,5.7519,3.5758,2.5229,1.6469,2.0412,3.8438,3.2409,2.6479,3.9072,4.1713,3.0125,2.1299,2.0764,3.8447,2.925,0.3578,0.0052,1.6586,0.2495,0.0002,5.0842,0.3095,0.0,0.0002,0.0003,0.0,0.0922,0.0001,0.7641,0.0002,0.0,0.0003,0.5747,8.0185,4.8866,3.8449,4.0335,4.3339]}

And that is a very good thing for this young woman. Because if it had been a guy or a woman or something else we would be sitting here, all of us.

I know what it feels like trying to change another person's heart, trying to show them that it's okay to change people's heart. And what it feels like you can be happy with, and there's so much joy and the possibility to live a life that's different. You see it in other people. I couldn't help but think about that. A woman's not as good a person as a man is. But that's what your life is meant to be. And you've got to give her that freedom, to give her something so important right now.

It really began to be called 'an autopsy' and when the case was opened up in 1999, the National Institute of Justice put out a statement saying it actually meant 'An autopsy' because it said '' The first person with the unique unique set of capabilities and the unique unique anatomy of a human body is able to live as long as any other human living on this planet, any period of time. This remains what it means to be human,'' said the statement. ''This makes it easier for us to understand why a person lived.''\n\nThe results and the long history of the study are still being investigated. An autopsy also has taken place at Yale University, some of the closest medical center centers in the world, and at a medical treatment center which is known for its strict adherence to strict patient safety guidelines.\n\nThere has been a lot of backlash against the study. On the one hand, one of the authors, Professor Alan Seabrook, has claimed that there is no such thing as \" 'genuine scientific validity' \" ; and on the other, those who oppose the findings have raised questions about the validity of the studies that the National Institutes of Health recently released that are now considered scientifically valid.","token_len":360,"entropy":[2.5476,2.317,0.089,3.7528,7.4255,6.5608,3.5671,4.6353,5.1334,0.3559,4.3283,10.0264,3.6992,0.3382,1.344,7.9778,10.8303,0.0055,0.9111,5.3014,7.5934,17.4666,1.7976,1.8344,5.7884,5.8664,1.0612,3.5089,0.1696,1.8756,3.674,9.9288,4.4208,2.6113,1.4796,6.1607,0.9044,3.3828,4.4702,2.0894,0.7721,2.635,9.3869,4.086,1.8257,7.6861,9.7423,6.0289,13.7607,4.3238,2.7735,2.9633,4.7822,0.2872,3.8434,4.6818,4.0058,1.3743,1.9445,1.997,3.1139,0.5509,2.1458,2.099,5.1955,3.8217,1.8253,0.006,4.7945,1.9819,3.8049,1.4922,4.6935,2.2292,1.0042,1.8406,3.5864,4.5497,4.6831,4.6925,4.8114,2.0762,1.3522,3.6948,1.1471,0.3755,1.0676,1.3316,1.2252,4.921,0.8227,0.7843,0.0705,0.6965,2.9515,0.0005,3.9198,6.6722,5.4048,0.8808,2.5611,2.4439,4.9487,3.334,2.8954,0.7331,1.4511,1.4881,1.4763,3.9743,4.7958,1.2485,3.0131,1.3469,1.5057,5.6133,6.0775,0.8951,2.8397,4.3566,1.9556,0.738,0.1142,0.8158,3.2285,4.8734,2.3928,5.4777,0.7781,3.8105,1.6386,2.6227,3.3988,0.6006,1.8971,4.1854,0.5362,0.1851,0.0093,5.6824,1.9949,0.5632,1.7942,0.8257,2.3061,6.3317,2.5815,1.7427,2.6804,0.2428,1.0281,2.869,1.2997,3.8582,5.1551,4.487,3.4382,2.9767,4.1863,2.6467,4.369,3.7004,5.3442,0.0176,5.8312,2.1939,3.4941,0.449,2.18,4.8837,0.6249,1.4064,0.2289,0.7162,1.8098,4.1703,0.0214,4.584,3.6285,1.2243,0.1123,1.9854,1.0756,0.6155,3.2425,0.8127,2.2588,0.1232,2.6389,4.9482,5.9903,0.3253,0.1771,1.449,3.4043,6.4034,5.5745,0.6411,1.8729,0.298,0.3337,0.765,4.7838,1.132,2.9128,0.845,0.766,2.7136,2.8305,5.3695,1.2775,4.977,0.6695,1.8359,0.1485,2.3435,2.301,3.276,1.3903,5.9547,5.1743,0.6008,0.0003,1.7647,5.572,5.7071,2.0469,5.6147,2.1112,0.2022,1.27,4.143,2.174,2.2489,1.2759,3.0134,1.3946,5.3077,0.6965,5.5068,2.8434,5.7998,0.2611,2.223,5.0633,0.6035,1.5233,6.3336,1.5536,1.1914,4.9873,3.1107,6.1052,5.4888,0.5774,0.155,0.6327,0.9811,1.0094,2.4264,3.0992,3.5993,6.296,0.287,5.7346,1.7617,4.3056,1.1819,0.6012,5.76,2.5313,0.0304,2.7666,4.4361,1.2906,2.0659,0.3044,0.627,0.0004,4.3207,2.6388,0.3166,1.4339,1.9048,0.0781,5.8918,1.6654,0.4587,1.9529,1.6282,4.6894,1.4417,1.5512,0.0356,0.1373,4.7452,1.6885,0.2019,1.6396,1.2689,3.9987,4.5358,5.7819,3.4482,0.8049,0.0393,0.504,2.4851,3.8045,0.5544,3.9014,0.9661,0.7339,3.6695,0.0944,0.0181,2.2392,7.9526,6.1505,2.8272,1.5669,3.3843,0.2403,1.8272,7.5449,3.411,1.9804,0.0322,0.01,0.6023,5.4784,0.5571,3.8089,0.5304,3.8521,1.6822,5.0998,1.0965,0.2857,0.8234,1.8149,0.0571,0.45,3.5968,3.6683,2.9293,2.6158,1.4802,0.0379,0.0079,5.5956,2.1175,5.0721,2.5163,3.8402,4.6269,4.5872,1.6569,0.2558]}

Someone has to fix them by taking the right steps on their own, rather than blaming others.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nGoogle\n\nReddit\n\nPinterest\n\n\nComments","token_len":360,"entropy":[2.8744,1.6056,9.5698,2.2569,0.5581,3.7589,8.0658,0.5688,7.151,2.2175,5.5804,3.2708,4.2121,2.5449,1.9019,3.0451,5.3814,0.5517,1.7307,3.4312,3.2794,0.5403,0.3308,1.6497,0.4288,7.0066,3.1613,5.8357,4.8651,1.7127,5.3989,5.5304,1.12,0.5388,1.7053,0.6198,0.009,4.4365,3.1592,5.5177,3.4897,0.4606,0.0533,2.7931,0.832,2.1124,1.0276,1.3256,5.2237,2.1014,2.7237,4.6522,2.5992,0.9464,5.6581,0.536,0.8483,2.2777,3.5534,0.6326,0.6816,4.5122,1.2688,3.5519,2.4553,4.4489,0.4356,0.1891,2.4516,2.8125,1.4772,2.3544,4.1107,0.8524,2.5817,3.1634,1.5335,2.4486,1.7302,0.7197,0.0003,2.854,5.1324,0.657,4.7154,0.5982,0.1509,1.7341,5.5915,0.1718,0.4455,0.2861,0.7616,4.1649,2.9721,0.4549,2.0286,5.2329,1.0247,3.7559,1.2989,5.1659,0.4895,1.9404,3.1133,0.1918,0.7976,1.0272,5.8023,0.0006,4.1195,0.5103,0.6705,2.5604,0.6547,2.4568,5.887,2.6698,0.6999,5.6525,0.8978,5.9741,0.9818,2.3184,3.9509,0.9179,3.8156,3.0441,5.3195,0.829,0.3389,5.6064,3.349,0.8646,1.5932,3.9227,1.0573,1.1059,0.9077,3.3079,2.6299,0.6081,0.3127,0.6433,0.5682,0.0002,4.3374,3.4893,5.2745,5.1059,5.0669,1.1492,1.2273,4.3111,6.2276,4.5697,1.3521,0.6492,0.8744,4.0103,4.1484,1.1077,4.6319,1.0699,1.8016,2.1561,0.7061,1.1835,4.9359,2.9478,3.7936,2.7655,3.1491,2.7994,3.3749,1.3024,1.1815,3.0518,2.3045,3.0923,5.75,5.2545,1.6182,1.554,0.4428,1.1197,0.0003,1.6724,2.0092,4.2316,5.7046,3.5738,5.2905,1.6335,1.9159,2.3221,6.7944,1.7606,3.8959,0.7427,4.4558,1.681,0.1907,1.4108,3.29,5.3854,3.2282,1.7631,2.2512,3.8404,2.7827,3.7574,4.2945,3.4569,3.0601,2.8654,2.6774,3.2121,0.2523,2.9172,3.9141,2.8207,3.0938,1.7207,1.95,3.3328,1.7203,1.6433,5.165,0.2314,3.6756,0.21,2.1799,5.1053,2.9541,3.5125,1.9689,5.4382,1.7416,1.7438,5.7556,2.1019,0.5636,2.1846,5.383,0.7969,5.3131,2.5368,4.4438,0.5228,0.0003,4.4415,6.4927,2.1638,2.4941,1.0848,2.6418,3.7279,2.9959,5.3556,1.0534,0.1289,3.4623,0.7071,3.5071,0.8374,0.5653,1.4909,3.8307,0.7668,6.4303,1.0,2.3811,0.7454,1.1636,0.1953,2.1995,3.3837,2.7028,2.7869,4.8334,0.5198,0.0162,4.1933,0.3154,0.2853,1.0288,0.0003,3.6863,3.6856,0.2191,0.126,1.0313,3.8003,0.0008,1.3569,4.5393,5.6779,0.9234,4.9467,4.2807,0.9508,2.2897,1.3798,2.9296,2.6002,0.7553,2.4211,0.917,3.9736,0.8005,1.4376,0.0964,0.1057,5.0149,0.5928,6.5985,2.2145,0.2385,4.3908,2.3558,5.6281,4.062,2.0339,4.5223,1.1189,5.9372,1.0769,0.0909,1.8998,3.0433,0.0037,3.3954,0.6475,0.8494,0.5903,0.0002,5.8532,0.224,0.1265,1.6577,0.0034,0.0002,0.1642,0.098,0.0001,2.8577,0.1492,0.0001,1.3165,0.2576,0.0002,1.047,0.3225,0.0002,1.6651,2.6389,0.0002,4.0658]}

As the internet and the online economy are moving faster than ever, it is good to help people innovate.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the near future, technology, which will change the whole economy and lead to better life outcomes for our society, will gradually increase the demand for this and provide higher quality access to goods and services.\n\nWe need to start thinking about these changes with a clear, clear thought process that can guide us towards better access for people, and we need to develop our own solutions to help make it possible, and create a new business ecosystem for people on our planet, as well as providing opportunities for people at the top to create better products in the long run.","token_len":366,"entropy":[12.9358,5.0823,8.699,1.3598,2.6038,0.4373,6.3555,10.7541,2.4797,5.9278,1.029,1.4322,4.6186,4.8615,1.4133,9.7913,8.3413,0.0704,0.8733,6.9044,0.2108,0.3668,1.8232,0.8343,1.6979,0.0028,5.5496,0.231,2.575,0.3618,2.3297,0.1213,5.0005,5.6483,0.1363,3.2593,1.026,4.8253,1.8201,1.502,0.0002,2.7906,5.4911,1.2926,0.5157,5.5554,3.857,1.0224,3.5444,4.9439,2.5317,4.5185,1.9519,0.0324,3.9154,5.6231,4.0465,1.8294,5.591,4.6064,4.7471,6.2529,1.4868,1.6369,4.6187,3.0884,4.1704,2.1125,3.2755,3.2534,3.3,5.2144,6.7096,1.3955,5.1446,4.814,6.6274,0.543,7.2555,6.1661,0.498,5.6374,0.2903,0.5332,3.1188,4.5584,2.1088,3.7279,5.1114,1.5213,1.1761,5.5512,1.3599,3.7627,1.5696,3.2553,4.5682,2.608,1.1947,5.5695,6.0058,2.5174,4.0853,2.9177,0.8283,4.9459,2.1498,1.2443,5.9767,0.3585,4.8523,3.0322,2.1728,1.3435,3.0576,5.1335,1.419,1.4437,1.8408,3.2145,2.0174,4.7342,2.4681,5.334,4.2237,0.8807,0.2792,1.9408,1.1489,4.6485,3.4077,6.6513,4.8793,0.888,0.9386,1.0308,3.0704,1.6989,4.4776,3.0173,0.9692,4.3709,1.0173,3.5202,2.8203,3.3274,0.6968,5.2588,1.7596,5.537,2.3044,2.8068,0.9533,0.7723,0.0002,4.47,1.3597,5.6227,0.6519,0.8097,1.8841,0.2079,0.054,0.0043,2.9468,0.853,3.8236,0.9944,0.8962,1.1242,4.0358,5.5488,4.4797,1.2279,5.3683,1.9422,6.0201,5.2447,4.7593,2.5918,4.0277,5.2537,6.0363,0.5096,3.6166,0.7201,1.7535,0.2098,2.3255,3.5501,5.6475,5.9601,3.2661,3.7695,2.7129,2.1016,3.1782,5.9185,1.5417,1.2059,1.0053,0.0002,3.3588,0.7514,5.3558,5.0692,1.4202,0.9889,5.0004,1.1851,0.4989,1.9544,0.3455,5.978,0.6378,2.4918,0.3784,0.0064,4.7705,2.1182,5.5826,3.8078,2.2392,2.8155,3.0255,0.3926,0.7652,4.4997,2.5281,4.3161,3.0207,1.6882,4.9814,1.275,2.7928,4.4961,4.1316,1.147,0.559,0.4868,1.4425,0.2725,2.5991,0.2906,3.6803,0.9187,5.4896,1.3522,1.0363,0.0003,5.0939,0.2146,0.0002,2.9259,1.6558,4.7217,0.1245,0.3612,4.2688,3.9245,3.4602,3.4379,3.4743,0.7817,4.7251,2.1006,1.5916,4.1822,0.0807,2.6962,3.2514,2.4734,1.3999,3.633,3.0428,0.2119,0.618,5.8365,3.0648,1.4547,3.688,0.1231,5.1563,4.1021,4.1329,5.081,1.1512,6.2539,0.2984,2.1825,0.6559,0.0288,0.4503,1.0964,0.0003,3.0258,2.024,0.3693,3.7774,1.6283,0.5344,3.727,3.5384,2.9947,1.8146,3.1113,3.8586,2.5162,4.8439,1.0097,3.3734,3.1687,3.525,0.7848,2.4581,2.5496,5.567,3.4899,2.2294,2.5533,1.9922,3.9903,0.7488,0.197,4.1017,3.5738,1.5944,2.1249,1.3062,3.2247,3.3132,2.7151,0.8201,4.1614,2.2904,4.7768,1.4174,1.8173,3.4281,4.4508,2.152,2.075,5.9889,4.2456,0.7545,2.928,3.44,0.7607,0.0612,4.5055,3.825,0.3672,2.0812,5.8147,2.1242,2.9974,1.4668,3.1339,2.7623,2.2133,4.5866,1.0812,3.0324,0.6725,0.2511]}

{"id":2764,"ended":true,"length":340,"gen_text":"Ghosts were playing dumb the whole time, so I couldn't do the math to find the odds. The odds of a 6-day event with all the different groups using only one group has a higher probability of finding the next one than a regular event with multiple categories with many categories using only one group.\n\nSo after finding and estimating the probability of getting 6 points, and then adjusting for all the different categories using only 5-6 categories, the probabilities of finding the next year are:\n\n7 (27%)\n\n8 (25%)\n\n9 (29%)\n\n10 (30%)\n\n11 A normal 9:0 for one category: 6.37\n\nFor more complete tables and examples click here.\n\nOne simple note about the data: after starting the new data set from scratch, and adjusting for any possible assumptions it may have, there's a very big difference between how many people have made some of the other categories and how many make more than the other categories.\n\nThis is a major bias from the perspective of the experimenter who didn't really understand how to use the data. He didn't know where the \"big one\" came from, what percentage of the results were based on only a single group, or what percentage of their groups were similar in the two ways. With no chance to really use multiple groups of researchers at once in this time-frame, that's really hard to understand.\n\nOverall, I think this data has a great number of implications that go beyond the data itself, if we think about it as a general approach to understanding people on our community, as well as the data that I gather. One is, it shows where the influence of people on other people is going to be, and where we might want to take it next.","token_len":368,"entropy":[5.209,4.6112,6.7392,7.8011,6.1888,0.6947,0.1446,1.701,2.3751,1.4733,4.585,0.0005,3.5965,3.8087,2.9318,3.9685,2.86,1.9305,5.7491,1.4634,3.2397,2.1192,1.4748,1.6088,5.4943,1.117,4.6291,4.3793,2.8357,4.8135,1.32,4.4376,4.4482,6.0338,3.54,1.4089,2.7634,5.6857,1.8341,4.6084,0.6183,0.5588,5.2232,1.5744,4.7209,2.8147,1.9124,1.8834,6.488,1.6122,0.8434,3.3879,7.6304,3.6083,4.2992,1.9374,4.168,0.3434,0.2816,0.2367,0.2207,1.1207,0.0056,2.4746,5.4909,4.4037,6.1622,5.0177,0.5524,1.939,0.3818,3.4938,4.4095,5.6172,1.6438,4.0047,1.8953,5.1839,0.6527,1.886,0.6976,1.5945,1.3922,1.8235,0.3239,6.1994,3.8422,1.47,1.9688,0.4375,2.4774,3.4766,0.8092,1.4066,1.2321,0.3414,5.5734,1.7888,1.2987,0.1771,0.0001,4.0997,4.5454,6.1025,1.6272,0.9369,0.0001,0.8313,0.0457,3.3449,0.0118,0.0634,0.0002,0.2272,0.0219,3.6726,0.0036,0.0621,0.0002,0.2652,0.04,2.2624,0.0015,0.0754,0.0002,0.9985,9.6102,4.4037,5.4655,5.497,4.4767,4.806,5.1933,1.8996,4.6907,3.3375,1.6771,5.3306,1.3214,0.0002,2.4223,4.1369,6.2084,3.6724,1.6659,4.1497,4.6804,0.2033,0.5289,0.5253,0.0002,5.5934,5.8427,5.6761,1.6077,1.6081,3.6491,1.3457,5.832,5.5683,1.5198,5.7768,3.1558,0.5739,4.2935,1.8306,0.3391,4.8751,4.381,0.4262,4.0168,2.9725,5.6635,4.6264,1.6264,0.4896,1.1431,3.4546,2.7523,1.1968,3.1309,3.7055,1.0653,0.7358,2.6948,2.4129,1.7803,2.9758,4.4655,5.8906,3.2802,0.4513,5.2885,1.1024,1.8788,0.2629,0.1361,5.1013,3.4979,1.2344,1.6505,2.2002,0.7799,0.3346,1.7533,0.0002,3.2786,1.164,2.6057,4.0764,5.5241,4.6501,0.997,4.3073,0.0486,1.7997,5.2516,0.6589,3.2001,3.8837,0.0003,3.7019,2.4905,2.2483,2.306,2.2679,0.999,1.0979,0.999,3.3725,2.6956,0.0005,1.4346,4.7013,1.2295,4.0285,4.1578,4.7933,0.0515,2.2033,0.0072,0.7926,2.7741,4.846,0.1636,0.9826,5.0919,1.0782,3.8589,0.0726,4.5852,2.5841,1.2214,2.3006,0.9847,0.7489,1.3685,1.237,0.2389,5.7052,5.175,0.6826,5.7814,2.189,2.8975,4.0058,4.8538,0.9828,6.1422,4.8098,5.9961,1.6868,4.414,3.9644,4.9119,1.3661,3.2574,5.3594,3.4639,0.4202,4.1952,2.6259,5.6047,3.0195,1.4683,0.2381,4.6633,1.8186,3.3542,2.3523,0.2766,3.2616,0.376,0.6392,0.0002,5.3436,0.3838,1.6127,1.0718,1.5194,2.4811,3.7468,1.8523,2.9822,4.5616,0.023,3.6964,3.9463,3.9827,0.4005,1.5726,2.6864,1.155,1.9863,5.816,2.1742,4.4225,0.3048,0.5682,2.0173,0.6423,3.8758,3.3468,0.4759,3.0988,4.7885,5.1488,4.6066,3.9269,2.9875,3.2469,1.2862,0.0579,2.0723,2.3541,2.2581,4.4342,5.6201,2.2889,5.331,4.4632,2.4577,1.9637,2.3659,5.9161,1.5276,5.8245,0.1062,3.4032,1.6959,2.4157,1.105,1.3757,2.9209,0.6586,0.4494,1.8678,0.7056,3.2132,3.3098,2.9602,1.7529,0.0865,3.0222,1.9478,4.1127,0.2428]}

{"id":2250,"ended":true,"length":368,"gen_text":"You're watching a kid '' s show about chemistry. However, the mix of chemicals seems awfully explosive... \"'I could see in the way that she was acting. The tone of her voice -- as if she were trying to keep up with everything she has to keep up to in the show -- she could be a complete idiot. She has been using these chemicals for years without ever talking to anyone and thus the whole team didn't hear her. \u00a0She had to watch them for that. And her coven was completely out of range. As we said earlier she was a complete idiot who didn't know how to react to something or would act any way she liked. If she did, the whole situation wouldn't need to be explained. Her team's reaction to things like this was to try to stay calm and explain her actions but her own teammates ignored her and instead tried to hide what she and the producers were doing. As far as there being a plot here, the script was a mixture of things I'm afraid for:... This might be the most damning line of the entire episode. This might not be something new. At first I didn't really think it would come off as very shocking. But when you've got to give the characters some space, I feel like the rest of the fight starts off extremely well. But then things start to get really messy. The whole fight starts to get very unbalanced and there is always a threat of something going to happen. The two storylines are also somewhat inconsistent -- that's one of the main reasons for it. That and she is doing terrible things to her team if necessary. In my view, the rest of the characters on this show are completely unaware of the truth behind what is happening in a season. And in the end, the stakes are higher than that. It is incredibly disappointing.","token_len":371,"entropy":[5.2847,5.9869,2.3026,5.0188,13.7172,8.2614,7.2491,4.1746,9.7015,1.7687,7.8857,0.135,2.4528,9.5389,0.9235,6.6584,6.2177,6.9322,7.1917,5.8117,10.3599,4.039,5.113,3.3745,4.7798,1.318,5.0679,2.7355,2.902,1.4814,4.5087,2.2554,3.8738,6.2184,1.3718,0.9018,0.2491,6.4063,5.0004,0.755,0.6658,2.1013,2.5311,0.0568,4.689,1.7946,0.5179,4.7262,1.7455,5.8925,1.0971,6.734,0.6097,5.3853,4.727,1.8591,3.0634,1.2148,3.0574,3.345,1.7207,2.5925,5.5005,3.4454,1.2319,2.1048,4.3837,4.0331,5.2553,4.0617,1.1584,1.016,1.3185,4.9358,2.7137,5.3039,0.6923,1.1171,3.2101,6.04,3.5994,3.0707,6.2039,4.1135,0.0226,4.3834,0.8938,1.5393,6.9403,0.661,2.0545,2.9818,2.0133,5.2343,2.526,2.6085,4.6142,2.2418,3.3692,4.6484,5.837,6.953,1.9127,4.2651,3.4134,0.0708,6.0571,1.3153,4.8861,3.5952,3.5134,2.682,4.0782,1.1643,2.5821,2.6676,0.8796,5.3006,2.2861,0.0085,1.4107,1.2422,0.1157,3.2707,0.6797,3.7172,3.812,5.7669,4.0211,3.9749,2.5793,0.4458,2.6211,0.6077,5.0487,1.1663,3.0482,1.5457,3.1305,1.4229,3.9851,3.2832,0.0131,7.2728,0.4632,0.644,2.4468,1.3912,4.3256,4.2328,4.3668,2.0095,1.5568,5.6301,1.7603,1.2758,1.2774,3.1924,3.0264,0.6782,4.5194,1.3395,0.9072,5.7638,3.5133,2.0882,4.3215,3.8603,4.4166,4.6299,6.0298,0.5697,1.5958,3.9669,2.8762,0.0476,4.6591,3.2367,1.6377,7.5437,1.5909,6.6789,0.963,0.7057,0.8537,3.9468,3.7528,0.0134,6.1812,3.7697,1.5228,5.3203,4.956,0.4029,2.691,5.2733,1.9308,3.1528,4.8907,0.042,3.9234,2.9755,3.8374,4.7498,4.8497,3.8546,7.679,5.2909,5.5987,0.8148,1.6063,2.2458,5.5468,5.0421,1.2125,0.6282,1.3225,1.3975,0.6298,3.4692,2.7219,2.9545,0.3575,4.3788,5.4345,2.1761,5.2773,2.6612,1.4565,3.2797,0.0015,2.8974,2.0813,1.194,1.8294,3.5999,3.1148,0.6061,4.3982,3.4425,1.0622,1.6244,2.7345,1.7675,3.6791,1.349,3.593,4.3285,2.158,4.4652,3.2751,3.7342,1.1648,2.6823,3.8612,0.5067,2.4309,5.1408,0.1115,0.2487,6.7475,4.3663,2.8758,5.4565,2.1194,0.4617,4.4242,1.876,3.8869,1.3434,0.5532,1.0491,1.9845,5.044,0.6887,2.3298,3.1056,3.2995,2.3214,0.8248,1.2434,2.8744,4.9348,1.4046,1.513,3.6498,1.8033,5.1656,1.2931,5.5833,1.3202,2.8398,1.7059,1.1415,0.4503,0.8769,2.5289,5.1549,5.8798,2.1561,4.9155,5.2079,3.584,5.3635,4.8855,1.4246,2.5802,0.6392,0.2715,2.6929,0.8966,3.0647,3.1202,0.559,4.688,5.6394,4.1675,2.9408,5.0722,5.4359,0.7891,1.3453,1.8619,1.459,7.0043,7.0381,0.3897,3.7279,3.5835,3.4052,0.5386,1.8817,4.6895,0.0767,0.2071,4.7782,4.8502,1.4594,0.2892,1.1226,4.0054,4.8324,0.2216,1.7888,5.279,1.6815,1.4472,1.9352,1.2741,2.6665,4.7143,5.7872,1.136,3.1069,3.5388,1.7678,0.6644,0.5642,2.1538,5.7151,0.9177,3.8389,0.5873,4.7375,0.5775,2.5819,2.8207,5.154,2.8646,1.697]}

Many people have heard this trope from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but I'm not a fan of the idea.

In fact, I don't think it should be part of any game and thus the game just didn't work out. The story is a metaphor for a genre that, with a twist, takes place in an alternate world or parallel universe.\n\nYou're more likely to be a player than you are in the English version.\n\nThis trope can be especially found in some video game and video game settings. In Super Thief, there's a video here about the difference between a Thief and a character that goes for stealth.\n\n. In Grown Ups 2, the English and the Spanish characters for Roto have a similar dialogue like this: \"There are 2, your life is very peaceful, but your life is very dark. What is the right path, which will lead you to success and to your destruction?\"\n\n, the English and the Spanish characters for Roto have a similar dialogue like this: \"There are 2, your life is very peaceful, but your life is very dark. What is the right path, which will lead you to success and to your destruction?\" It has very little meaning if the game has no dialogue. The game is said to be based on Japanese folklore and this is actually very common at my school. The story is in very short order written in English as a guide to what is important in any given situation.\n\nVideo Games\n\nWestern Animation","token_len":373,"entropy":[9.5417,6.0334,5.2725,4.4972,3.9708,8.8753,4.1096,1.6163,1.5925,0.0241,7.4084,4.0627,5.7479,1.5901,5.7957,0.1209,3.988,2.7324,0.0453,0.0344,1.2921,1.8529,0.0735,0.0016,0.0001,1.3351,6.2237,2.5097,1.6442,4.3435,3.1595,4.1043,3.9108,3.6752,0.2418,0.0076,0.0015,0.9666,1.9435,0.0034,0.0042,0.0001,1.1379,0.993,1.4342,2.4931,1.019,3.428,0.7456,1.0804,1.7685,1.6395,0.7766,3.6429,0.9116,0.1069,0.7191,2.1505,0.0007,1.1545,1.0807,3.9555,0.3486,4.6987,0.0011,1.7852,1.7015,4.8307,5.0319,3.8989,1.564,5.02,4.896,0.0015,2.1585,2.2366,1.0098,1.3567,0.0003,5.9932,1.5657,0.0012,0.0534,0.0023,0.0022,0.0007,0.0005,0.0009,0.0004,0.0012,0.0289,0.0038,0.0005,0.0003,0.0033,0.0004,0.0018,0.0015,0.0014,0.0013,0.0014,0.0005,0.0009,0.0004,0.0033,0.0097,0.0018,0.0022,0.0042,0.0172,0.0003,0.0014,0.0009,0.0009,1.7744,3.8643,1.22,2.8015,5.8312,0.5963,2.4375,5.094,1.7926,4.4874,4.4009,2.2495,4.0293,0.3463,4.857,1.1353,0.6965,2.7095,0.478,1.9655,4.9151,4.7902,0.6086,0.6058,1.0772,0.0002,5.7229,2.0553,4.9388,0.8463,0.0332,2.1985,2.1871,5.6783,2.2658,2.5533,0.3801,4.0056,1.8523,5.7077,1.2089,0.8748,0.6386,0.0001,3.3343,1.216,3.3539,0.5883,4.8221,5.9006,0.2393,4.6694,2.8902,1.8712,4.5763,2.2133,0.1858,5.4952,1.0044,2.4295,4.3732,7.1274,0.7337,3.4627,1.0509,0.4967,4.3713,6.6657,3.083,2.0244,4.6278,0.2406,2.5659,3.5793,0.9516,0.388,4.7479,3.0155,5.4556,3.7529,2.7749,0.9695,1.0789,0.0003,6.4091,1.368,6.3625,4.2946,0.7536,2.3035,0.3443,1.7585,5.9331,4.1433,2.7322,2.1657,4.9643,5.7329,6.0772,4.6172,3.8946,2.2129,1.0339,3.3732,6.2738,1.6597,0.9425,1.3283,5.1162,1.7725,6.0849,3.3159,6.0341,4.4322,0.5944,4.8924,4.773,1.4609,1.3778,3.0034,1.4085,0.2242,1.562,3.3334,1.0873,4.0917,2.2066,1.8161,4.8035,2.545,2.7407,5.5641,2.9154,1.3319,0.3262,0.314,4.9996,2.0955,3.1406,3.1107,5.8938,0.6039,0.7457,0.0003,5.5948,0.0091,0.0074,0.0014,0.0017,0.0012,0.0025,0.0004,0.0252,0.0003,0.0044,0.0052,0.0017,0.0084,0.0023,0.003,0.0106,0.136,0.1109,0.0036,0.0177,0.0007,0.0016,0.0016,0.0009,0.0009,0.0015,0.0009,0.0017,0.0014,0.0019,0.0026,0.0012,0.0024,0.001,0.0018,0.002,0.001,0.0007,0.0005,0.0007,0.0002,0.0028,0.0007,0.0007,0.0003,0.0025,0.0008,0.001,0.0053,0.0002,0.0419,3.558,3.8252,5.6911,0.9216,3.1264,2.9928,1.4611,1.6564,3.1525,2.0292,2.3564,1.3275,2.6971,2.0995,1.8374,5.2984,0.0573,0.9291,2.9136,0.2222,5.1279,2.2756,1.968,4.4008,1.3282,5.0042,3.3231,1.719,5.2968,6.1984,0.9918,0.4953,3.044,3.52,1.2685,5.0192,5.2416,2.4206,1.2688,6.0184,1.2688,1.8229,4.1585,2.2849,4.6183,1.0536,2.7004,2.1752,3.9877,1.8822,4.2967,1.0555,0.5027,0.5578,0.9721,0.0002,2.9489,0.6483,0.28,0.0002,3.2033,0.0153]}

The game has a lot to offer in regards to the story line, but because of the plot point it would have also been interesting to collect the whole series to start with, not just one big piece but three.\n\n. It has three endings, of which all endings were cut. The end to all three endings is a very good plot point where he is able to save himself by taking a shower or whatever. The final version ends with him spending two hours in a bath.\n\n. The ending of the story would have been quite hard to handle, with a lot of scenes of him taking showers or being forced by others to do so, making the game extremely difficult to play with other players trying to get the final ending.\n\nand that really goes some way towards explaining the plot and ending. As far as there being so many issues with the ending, I really have to give his ending a 9.\n\n. It turns out that in any case, this is a very good game for anyone new to the series who wants to enjoy a new adventure, but there were some serious flaws in the story, such as the characters being very young, which probably makes them somewhat underdeveloped beyond what is revealed in the game.

The game has a lot to offer in regards to the story line, but because of the plot point it would have also been interesting to collect the whole series to start with, not just one big piece but three.\n\n. It has three endings, of which all endings were cut. The end to all three endings is a very good plot point where he is able to save himself by taking a shower or whatever. The final version ends with him spending two hours in a bath.\n\n. The ending of the story would have been quite hard to handle, with a lot of scenes of him taking showers or being forced by others to do so, making the game extremely difficult to play with other players trying to get the final ending.\n\nand that really goes some way towards explaining the plot and ending. As far as there being so many issues with the ending, I really have to give his ending a 9.\n\n. It turns out that in any case, this is a very good game for anyone new to the series who wants to enjoy a new adventure, but there were some serious flaws in the story, such as the characters being very young, which probably makes them somewhat underdeveloped beyond what is revealed in the game. At the same time, the game is very much designed to make those who haven't bought yet a good read in the genre a little more curious as to how the game develops over time.\n\n\nSo what's your opinion on the story?

{"id":1393,"ended":true,"length":365,"gen_text":"Write your own characters ( or those from another universe ) into the roles and rules of an established universe, and play with that in the way that those characters would otherwise need.\n\nThe fact is that with all the things I have attempted to cover in terms of the main story I am not a fan of the idea that there must be a story within this storyline right now.\n\nThe game is fairly light.\n\nIt is a fairly high resolution version where everything you need is on-screen but you're not trying to play the game on it. On the other hand, the lack of a ton of stuff on-screen would mean that it would feel completely wrong with a 4K computer screen. If you want your game to feel solid and interactive, then your game needs to have quality in depth controls like some consoles do, and are compatible with 4K monitors.\n\nWhat the devs are doing here with this game, however, is using a technique known as light filtering based on things like lighting. They have shown a decent amount of progress in terms of this feature in their games, so for this game to be good, it would require more than a 2K resolution (in most cases 2K). The other way to give the characters some depth: The game will show you how fast the camera moves depending on the setting, while also giving characters an opportunity to go forward and try to find something that will work better the more they go forward in time. They could provide two different scenarios, one of which is trying to find a place to shoot a certain number of enemies and go back to using that point if necessary, while then getting stuck in a situation where one of them can't get up. I won't go into my own ways, but the real point I would like to focus on is that if this is done right, the final product would be different.","token_len":380,"entropy":[6.2085,2.7588,6.74,4.1715,8.109,6.6532,3.4449,3.6013,4.2323,0.7262,3.7683,1.3579,8.7712,3.2619,6.391,1.5193,4.7409,4.9939,3.5647,2.3436,1.5641,4.6876,2.2391,3.2268,2.8541,2.1054,3.8797,1.2653,5.6572,1.0032,2.0449,4.7085,5.9426,1.9015,1.2275,0.1098,3.216,5.7262,1.9215,0.8001,5.6972,3.3198,1.2616,4.945,2.7927,2.3186,6.0936,1.1482,3.6234,1.2394,6.8183,0.0009,2.6654,4.7556,2.4694,3.7054,2.4779,2.0167,3.7784,1.4573,0.1172,2.077,2.48,2.1185,2.7053,3.8693,0.0934,1.1232,3.6022,4.8876,2.9584,5.9887,7.0214,0.4183,0.4062,2.1849,0.0002,2.6831,5.4285,1.6309,5.0574,5.5947,3.3192,2.3134,0.0001,2.6189,1.4807,2.4281,2.5633,5.6983,4.2467,2.7855,6.1651,3.5741,3.369,2.4463,1.6473,3.2697,4.5958,0.123,4.3504,2.6366,4.7845,1.664,5.2108,0.0382,2.9473,2.3685,0.8769,1.7758,4.0522,0.7466,6.4021,0.5955,0.9513,0.0123,0.7219,1.8895,5.7064,0.0116,2.2672,5.3464,0.5513,4.2297,2.4474,1.342,0.0329,4.6658,3.0194,0.6415,2.2201,0.8245,4.0841,5.4416,4.7026,5.8274,2.0563,4.0932,1.1154,5.2997,1.3033,0.8863,3.9894,0.8244,2.369,4.4624,2.2705,0.1088,3.2173,5.862,1.6851,5.4121,1.0659,1.2765,4.5091,1.4864,0.8949,0.3503,1.4068,5.3471,4.0127,5.8456,4.5602,4.9066,5.117,5.2635,1.3814,1.8213,1.382,5.7972,5.5349,0.077,4.0947,0.0908,1.9251,0.4079,0.7212,0.0002,4.2281,3.9481,4.2069,1.7107,2.1162,2.0294,4.0463,1.8338,1.1724,3.6932,2.6147,0.0559,0.1799,5.2218,1.8027,4.4803,2.3947,0.0366,6.3704,3.1832,6.4138,0.4206,6.4078,0.606,4.3896,2.7834,3.5269,2.59,4.2147,2.5173,5.8147,0.5401,0.0214,3.4556,1.4158,3.875,0.0009,2.1329,4.6937,1.8456,2.1183,3.0772,1.1469,2.872,4.9612,2.6341,1.2744,1.0496,1.6823,2.6463,1.1133,1.3422,1.884,2.1137,3.8651,0.848,2.1072,4.4849,0.9054,2.5693,4.4079,4.5477,4.3092,0.5508,4.4963,0.4834,3.9619,3.0216,4.7755,4.1791,0.9889,6.0239,1.979,6.2135,3.2445,1.2711,6.9022,4.5757,1.6535,2.9469,3.8008,1.2959,2.5873,6.3499,2.0172,3.7307,0.5883,5.3463,0.0346,1.2269,4.8186,1.9772,4.3735,1.9178,2.3632,6.4606,3.2446,2.9044,0.0383,4.6897,5.4569,1.4976,4.4715,0.9569,2.883,2.8527,2.1374,1.9108,3.0214,2.5676,6.3857,3.0307,1.7893,2.2064,0.7352,3.2726,3.5488,0.2068,4.6472,4.5789,6.0941,6.085,1.6011,4.0726,1.9703,1.4854,3.3479,0.4125,1.2525,4.8609,0.022,0.7803,1.3404,3.2172,1.3369,4.6852,2.5582,4.0868,2.3146,0.0188,2.0827,2.0797,5.5688,2.1369,0.7125,6.0309,2.1409,3.7851,5.8205,3.7633,1.4663,1.332,6.7984,4.2557,3.9987,0.9605,1.4974,3.9779,0.4187,3.9039,0.6898,1.6564,2.0847,1.1601,2.0366,3.3279,1.5707,3.6563,5.5808,0.0011,1.1648,0.1239,6.7348,1.9883,5.7454,2.4847,0.3714,2.6537,5.631,1.617,4.0831,2.3331,0.3435,0.0329,4.6599,0.0543,0.663,1.7563,3.1904,3.0048,1.8171,3.0515,1.4743,0.3265,1.8445,6.0663,2.297,2.6382,0.9095,6.0815,0.9806]}

The Truth\" about how the Devil used a girl named Stella to kill her father.\n\nThis could be because she has very high sexual functioning - she has a tendency to play devilish games, but only after she makes up for it by playing her favorite game, PEDRA.\n\nGallery [ edit ]","token_len":383,"entropy":[7.4262,4.5543,3.2103,7.5116,1.0283,2.319,4.8297,7.3003,1.2112,2.1658,1.5259,1.904,5.5593,1.9641,1.5217,0.0004,0.3466,0.1322,0.3563,1.9256,0.9231,5.7616,0.2398,0.0991,9.2334,0.4144,1.5614,1.3791,7.1415,3.358,5.9755,3.3887,3.0857,0.8029,5.811,3.0858,7.0603,4.5235,1.4463,2.2399,0.1223,5.8951,3.797,4.85,3.8091,1.4963,4.3089,1.4019,1.551,4.5299,0.9988,1.4909,5.3713,3.1875,1.9389,2.4689,2.1905,4.3184,0.5828,1.1899,2.3964,4.4278,0.5889,2.6005,0.7603,3.5243,1.9403,6.5285,0.9678,4.0957,1.4403,4.6222,2.351,1.3385,3.0984,0.4924,0.3195,0.1832,2.0545,0.0002,4.3261,5.4366,0.6568,3.5796,4.201,2.5583,1.2126,4.4689,1.757,1.093,0.9188,1.9884,5.338,4.4034,1.479,5.2767,4.5978,5.7683,1.7602,0.8295,5.7525,5.792,0.5972,4.5701,2.3368,1.3997,4.6703,2.6701,4.7219,2.7829,0.158,3.7995,0.4532,6.0266,8.0892,2.4948,4.6249,3.5207,0.6793,2.3927,5.7205,3.0735,0.9141,3.3938,1.3969,0.2967,1.9406,0.6233,2.5059,0.7836,2.186,3.7997,0.0404,4.773,2.3777,2.4785,1.6508,0.6697,0.4774,2.4824,4.4152,1.4327,1.3198,0.5362,1.0892,0.404,4.9617,0.6908,1.0186,0.0002,8.2951,6.5966,1.2086,2.4362,1.3305,1.6507,0.6735,0.3292,0.0312,0.0788,0.0066,0.0013,0.0347,2.3264,3.0391,1.1509,0.7021,0.015,0.0154,0.0102,0.021,0.0028,0.0022,0.0036,0.045,1.8472,0.0857,0.0199,4.8012,3.4949,0.4116,1.0145,0.7656,0.0009,1.7969,4.9231,0.0276,0.0072,0.0005,0.0015,0.0044,0.0164,0.0042,0.0021,0.0024,0.0029,0.0017,0.0085,0.7264,6.0588,1.1928,0.0632,0.0407,0.0054,0.0044,0.0057,0.0266,0.0003,0.0053,0.0039,0.0001,0.001,0.0128,0.0015,0.0017,0.0069,0.0058,0.0013,0.0004,0.0011,0.0102,0.0004,0.0014,0.0013,0.0003,0.0006,0.0016,0.0013,0.0002,0.0035,0.0019,0.0016,0.0013,0.0006,2.6912,5.7966,0.2604,0.0293,2.7651,1.472,2.0824,5.2055,1.241,1.5233,5.4873,0.966,3.8415,1.7506,1.9535,0.9997,3.9098,4.0151,0.1621,1.7621,1.3865,5.5403,1.0245,4.6398,1.2767,2.8216,5.4406,2.6072,2.4664,2.0037,0.7374,1.8233,2.9635,5.1675,3.1134,4.8373,4.6796,3.0895,0.3463,0.7106,0.9393,0.379,0.3452,0.8233,0.0001,3.7213,2.1054,4.3528,5.7902,4.9546,0.9608,0.0155,0.7778,3.6873,0.79,4.4884,3.0977,2.4609,4.3532,0.4509,1.9695,2.2825,1.9607,0.7071,1.8728,1.7897,4.1489,1.2454,2.048,1.7337,4.088,3.9854,1.3572,1.2317,1.6167,2.8288,2.9887,4.1846,0.7673,5.5541,4.6414,0.3863,0.0036,5.726,2.6236,3.7352,3.6912,2.2759,2.9416,1.9177,3.3807,4.1612,3.3642,3.212,1.3043,6.0523,0.7648,2.2049,0.8089,1.4075,0.8289,0.7236,0.0001,3.4809,1.8962,0.3837,2.5756,1.1633,2.6723,5.7647,3.3607,4.5011,5.4602,4.4228,1.8447,1.9565,1.5015,4.8147,0.1077,5.615,5.4441,5.2041,2.3617,1.9663,2.8477,5.0092,2.9661,1.1466,5.6028,3.3079,3.4218,0.9077,1.7364,3.5093,3.8456,3.4909,2.1892,1.2254,6.4518,5.4495,5.527,0.9328,0.7064,0.0001,4.6114,2.4645,0.0004,0.0139]}

The Truth\" about how the Devil used a girl named Stella to kill her father.\n\nThis could be because she has very high sexual functioning - she has a tendency to play devilish games, but only after she makes up for it by playing her favorite game, PEDRA.\n\nGallery [ edit ]","token_len":383,"entropy":[7.4262,4.5543,3.2103,7.5116,1.0283,2.319,4.8297,7.3003,1.2112,2.1658,1.5259,1.904,5.5593,1.9641,1.5217,0.0004,0.3466,0.1322,0.3563,1.9256,0.9231,5.7616,0.2398,0.0991,9.2334,0.4144,1.5614,1.3791,7.1415,3.358,5.9755,3.3887,3.0857,0.8029,5.811,3.0858,7.0603,4.5235,1.4463,2.2399,0.1223,5.8951,3.797,4.85,3.8091,1.4963,4.3089,1.4019,1.551,4.5299,0.9988,1.4909,5.3713,3.1875,1.9389,2.4689,2.1905,4.3184,0.5828,1.1899,2.3964,4.4278,0.5889,2.6005,0.7603,3.5243,1.9403,6.5285,0.9678,4.0957,1.4403,4.6222,2.351,1.3385,3.0984,0.4924,0.3195,0.1832,2.0545,0.0002,4.3261,5.4366,0.6568,3.5796,4.201,2.5583,1.2126,4.4689,1.757,1.093,0.9188,1.9884,5.338,4.4034,1.479,5.2767,4.5978,5.7683,1.7602,0.8295,5.7525,5.792,0.5972,4.5701,2.3368,1.3997,4.6703,2.6701,4.7219,2.7829,0.158,3.7995,0.4532,6.0266,8.0892,2.4948,4.6249,3.5207,0.6793,2.3927,5.7205,3.0735,0.9141,3.3938,1.3969,0.2967,1.9406,0.6233,2.5059,0.7836,2.186,3.7997,0.0404,4.773,2.3777,2.4785,1.6508,0.6697,0.4774,2.4824,4.4152,1.4327,1.3198,0.5362,1.0892,0.404,4.9617,0.6908,1.0186,0.0002,8.2951,6.5966,1.2086,2.4362,1.3305,1.6507,0.6735,0.3292,0.0312,0.0788,0.0066,0.0013,0.0347,2.3264,3.0391,1.1509,0.7021,0.015,0.0154,0.0102,0.021,0.0028,0.0022,0.0036,0.045,1.8472,0.0857,0.0199,4.8012,3.4949,0.4116,1.0145,0.7656,0.0009,1.7969,4.9231,0.0276,0.0072,0.0005,0.0015,0.0044,0.0164,0.0042,0.0021,0.0024,0.0029,0.0017,0.0085,0.7264,6.0588,1.1928,0.0632,0.0407,0.0054,0.0044,0.0057,0.0266,0.0003,0.0053,0.0039,0.0001,0.001,0.0128,0.0015,0.0017,0.0069,0.0058,0.0013,0.0004,0.0011,0.0102,0.0004,0.0014,0.0013,0.0003,0.0006,0.0016,0.0013,0.0002,0.0035,0.0019,0.0016,0.0013,0.0006,2.6912,5.7966,0.2604,0.0293,2.7651,1.472,2.0824,5.2055,1.241,1.5233,5.4873,0.966,3.8415,1.7506,1.9535,0.9997,3.9098,4.0151,0.1621,1.7621,1.3865,5.5403,1.0245,4.6398,1.2767,2.8216,5.4406,2.6072,2.4664,2.0037,0.7374,1.8233,2.9635,5.1675,3.1134,4.8373,4.6796,3.0895,0.3463,0.7106,0.9393,0.379,0.3452,0.8233,0.0001,3.7213,2.1054,4.3528,5.7902,4.9546,0.9608,0.0155,0.7778,3.6873,0.79,4.4884,3.0977,2.4609,4.3532,0.4509,1.9695,2.2825,1.9607,0.7071,1.8728,1.7897,4.1489,1.2454,2.048,1.7337,4.088,3.9854,1.3572,1.2317,1.6167,2.8288,2.9887,4.1846,0.7673,5.5541,4.6414,0.3863,0.0036,5.726,2.6236,3.7352,3.6912,2.2759,2.9416,1.9177,3.3807,4.1612,3.3642,3.212,1.3043,6.0523,0.7648,2.2049,0.8089,1.4075,0.8289,0.7236,0.0001,3.4809,1.8962,0.3837,2.5756,1.1633,2.6723,5.7647,3.3607,4.5011,5.4602,4.4228,1.8447,1.9565,1.5015,4.8147,0.1077,5.615,5.4441,5.2041,2.3617,1.9663,2.8477,5.0092,2.9661,1.1466,5.6028,3.3079,3.4218,0.9077,1.7364,3.5093,3.8456,3.4909,2.1892,1.2254,6.4518,5.4495,5.527,0.9328,0.7064,0.0001,4.6114,2.4645,0.0004,0.0139]}

One can call it the \"first true written written Sanskrit alphabet,\" and that \"first true alphabet\" being Latin for \"text.\"\n\nSee also:\n\nReferences","token_len":385,"entropy":[4.0641,5.7875,2.0279,2.3894,10.4776,1.8541,10.9174,1.863,3.8471,5.0764,6.7348,3.818,1.8135,4.9452,1.0302,6.1783,14.2618,0.4178,1.0683,0.0105,6.034,3.5396,5.7219,0.8385,2.8615,4.7655,5.6032,0.7586,1.3477,2.0444,3.9887,4.1671,3.022,1.1979,4.2726,2.3586,3.5185,2.5875,5.4008,3.6587,0.0019,4.313,4.7577,5.8202,5.1287,2.5138,3.8002,1.3812,3.1921,5.7729,3.0743,2.5707,3.5386,0.4309,0.18,1.7551,5.2363,6.0093,3.0464,1.9228,0.3986,6.0854,3.1231,3.7296,1.1641,1.2992,1.4662,1.8952,0.0003,2.5781,0.9168,5.8978,0.1464,3.264,1.7346,0.8165,3.1798,0.1713,1.1907,5.6306,5.0286,1.5022,1.275,0.0002,2.7145,5.3488,0.9749,3.3495,0.1389,6.1691,4.1398,1.417,0.5235,0.0003,1.1186,5.2228,3.7623,2.1778,3.1448,3.5847,0.616,1.9428,4.9358,2.424,1.1401,2.3483,4.1706,3.8089,2.0403,1.6448,1.5176,6.2205,1.0858,2.1166,0.1225,0.0835,0.9957,4.0237,1.961,0.6121,1.5572,2.9479,2.3961,4.836,2.9508,4.2954,5.8772,0.4085,4.3317,0.4655,3.0087,0.6867,1.2064,0.0003,1.1733,5.9219,1.9701,0.615,1.0286,3.2715,0.1781,0.2378,6.3596,0.9836,5.098,2.5927,1.6323,1.477,2.0694,0.2543,0.5668,0.0003,5.5184,4.9059,1.6312,0.0004,4.5514,1.7773,0.4953,0.0003,3.2178,0.4735,2.092,2.804,4.5391,1.0179,3.3739,0.6479,1.4794,3.7964,4.453,0.4471,4.8448,2.7395,0.3136,5.224,1.541,0.0031,5.7928,5.6507,0.9797,2.0481,0.9193,4.51,2.075,3.9848,4.3591,3.6005,3.4369,2.9273,6.5634,0.6968,5.2089,0.6813,3.3829,2.8534,3.9971,5.4982,0.1375,6.5357,0.8988,3.3428,2.3276,1.0718,0.0002,2.9461,0.4732,0.9651,5.1556,0.8571,0.287,4.3302,0.1381,3.8737,0.16,1.3163,0.5889,2.0636,5.4763,0.0488,3.0282,1.1387,3.6299,3.0398,1.2496,0.1208,2.4879,2.8718,0.5957,0.5559,0.4151,1.2691,1.0505,0.0002,2.0125,0.4118,1.783,1.9159,0.4523,0.3836,0.0976,5.1879,2.7998,3.1743,3.2332,1.3626,2.3683,3.0964,5.9014,0.028,3.7523,0.285,0.4822,1.9703,2.6511,3.0722,1.3333,2.7986,0.0776,1.2328,1.0004,0.3231,5.301,5.4153,1.9205,4.6042,0.0161,1.8456,1.4835,0.2199,0.6794,0.4663,1.9803,5.9296,0.0175,1.1582,1.2181,0.4997,3.7829,1.7466,1.3632,5.8081,3.5712,2.1223,1.6047,5.6043,0.0458,2.1539,1.8002,0.5259,4.1022,0.2823,3.9322,0.4793,6.2205,1.5353,2.6262,4.0867,4.5869,3.9079,1.9808,1.2678,1.4471,2.0248,2.0281,4.8471,1.6592,0.5522,3.6953,0.6536,0.2559,6.1722,2.2205,3.5672,5.3293,2.8353,5.6486,0.9877,0.383,0.0002,3.8984,0.1339,0.972,0.0002,2.4352,0.0109,1.7232,2.9313,0.0353,2.6967,2.7935,5.4791,5.9418,6.2402,1.2276,2.4841,3.1468,0.0036,0.6962,0.0005,0.0017,0.0003,0.0187,5.5924,4.1731,4.0488,3.1872,0.7198,4.4736,3.8059,6.0934,2.4975,4.8025,1.4274,2.5607,1.1926,5.7613,5.6563,5.4878,5.9581,6.5959,2.8132,0.7487,2.2411,3.886,3.6806,3.5044,1.5084,3.5059,1.0117,5.0898,5.0533,2.0578,0.3869,5.8841,1.3136,0.8007,0.0002,3.9655,0.1826,1.2935,2.5569,0.0002,1.9018]}

You never know if that sickness is coming to somebody or if it will continue to come to you.\n\nSo then you are lucky, and if it's healthy enough to survive the time it took you to get sick you have nothing left.\n\nSo you are not happy with this and you say \"I just didn't live long enough \u00a0to have this feeling \". Then you try to find others and talk to your neighbor or friend. The problem is you will never find people who can share this feeling. It will never work out for you because you are too busy with your relationship to worry what you want for your long term relationships.\n\nYou still can't say that you will love people, nor love some friends but it is easy to hate people because you can't hate your relationship and you can't get it to work out because you think you have the right to live. Sometimes things can happen very unexpectedly so it is time to let go yourself.\n\nSo let's give up on waiting for those who already love you to live and hope you can help them when they die. Let's accept your demise in order to live the best life possible. The sad truth is that you are only now realizing how your love for others will be broken so you are trying to find your way back.\n\nIf life's the same at any point in time because people have never been as loved, understand your journey that way. What will it like for you after you die and how you will feel when you die if it doesn't work out for the rest of your lives you are so lonely.

You can see how this can sound strange when you make such mistakes yourself. I never thought it would actually happen to humans, but it did happen to me. It is very easy to become so lost in history that you're so sure that nobody will ever see you again. For me, what made it this way was because of the people who were actually here for me. We have all been affected by the events of Time: The Third World. This is how we see things. Some things aren't as simple as just being here. We don't want any one or anything at all. As a group, we can change a lot. But it is too simple. The people around are so powerful and strong to me that I can't imagine how any of them could become so powerful again. I want them to be my friends and my fans. I want them to stay with me. It is the most powerful feeling of our lives. A lifetime of doing this is already hard, like I say. But it is a wonderful journey. I feel like I already started the process to understand the reasons behind this: I feel like so long as we continue to help each other, we can stay together. Let's make the relationship strong and together. Let's start talking about where the other is now. At this place, there is no reason to talk about past relationships that are even now, or to talk about future relationships, because that would mean the very beginning of your own problems, and I can't help but think of you. When I was in this place, my time at my place is over. But at this time, I am not alone. We are all here, just like you are. I will be there for you.\nPosted by Anonymous at 10:00 PM","token_len":389,"entropy":[7.1549,0.3239,8.0954,7.6084,1.9003,7.1269,0.2689,2.3719,3.5188,2.4982,5.8901,6.2327,5.3755,3.4731,0.8114,0.1536,2.1061,1.5376,1.6949,5.4521,5.7985,4.9141,1.4146,1.4151,0.2812,2.5393,0.0111,0.363,5.3118,1.4536,2.0518,2.4007,1.3196,2.4623,6.5632,5.0554,2.8258,0.7532,6.5246,4.3951,5.1843,3.6006,0.5882,3.8468,5.5163,2.2493,2.8539,0.5077,5.599,0.7853,1.9023,7.0929,0.8624,0.4317,1.4188,2.182,1.4223,0.608,1.4069,0.573,2.8744,2.3386,3.5523,2.3841,0.2174,3.0789,3.8502,5.2712,0.3274,6.1159,0.8374,0.6275,4.6857,4.0568,4.6377,1.1402,4.4289,0.887,0.8408,1.3756,0.9257,0.141,0.3543,5.3756,2.105,0.2743,5.1302,3.4652,1.5261,4.8675,0.8274,0.4855,4.1504,1.8238,1.3638,3.8523,0.8378,2.3596,4.796,4.0999,3.8234,0.9585,0.6733,4.2184,4.0188,3.2526,1.3593,6.1478,0.1856,1.7941,2.7757,0.6983,6.8447,4.9896,2.3271,5.4035,3.1807,1.5843,3.7403,1.1591,3.6761,1.4354,4.0208,2.8143,1.0787,5.2609,3.8771,4.6024,0.0003,2.0879,3.4084,0.1086,4.4486,1.6807,1.3807,0.7928,2.4646,3.3825,0.0004,3.8533,5.1217,3.0325,5.243,2.7913,3.9622,0.0539,0.6359,4.7687,2.0819,1.9416,0.454,0.4291,3.5982,4.5673,4.2878,0.8949,1.4121,3.2409,3.228,1.6039,5.098,3.8018,1.1281,2.9103,2.3977,3.7793,5.7514,2.2984,3.8287,2.0393,3.6756,3.067,4.482,1.2841,1.0187,1.9643,0.6383,3.0665,2.0442,3.5301,1.1559,0.562,0.796,3.977,1.1603,1.0807,4.275,0.1736,1.7757,3.5014,2.1419,0.3415,1.4038,3.7912,0.9761,1.6629,1.6453,6.0,0.5184,1.324,0.4297,0.2435,0.0189,4.3123,1.4216,0.0451,1.2458,3.2745,0.9771,3.1961,2.6757,2.2153,3.0404,2.7808,4.7783,0.5619,0.4224,5.0416,4.6846,0.5559,5.0987,1.1653,1.5971,5.2703,4.2455,2.1037,6.4747,3.4114,3.4308,0.6132,1.9484,1.9964,0.9592,3.0443,3.7545,5.9761,0.5932,1.654,3.5014,1.7091,0.5631,6.0246,5.5457,2.9891,1.888,3.5926,4.574,2.0287,5.2771,1.5961,1.8481,5.9742,1.6794,3.4188,0.6759,6.7392,5.0133,0.4815,2.0613,3.0821,0.7013,5.0232,0.7356,0.0151,0.4791,1.0276,1.3085,5.0788,0.4823,0.9198,5.3585,0.5295,3.1432,2.6724,5.6542,4.6765,1.5007,4.8823,0.6034,1.8674,0.0439,3.94,3.8883,0.4924,5.8078,3.2,3.7805,1.6832,3.149,0.4612,5.8804,1.8045,6.0868,0.5315,2.4576,0.8218,1.0243,4.7555,0.836,3.5563,0.1849,5.3568,1.9874,4.4762,2.1464,5.427,3.0073,2.7099,2.3236,3.4606,1.2849,0.0226,2.037,0.9322,2.6703,1.8965,2.3254,1.2184,2.9437,3.8437,4.9395,3.1507,0.3438,4.8146,1.715,4.3983,2.5666,1.4667,2.88,3.1486,0.5986,3.0462,0.2251,1.2796,1.5062,2.615,1.1888,4.0895,1.0762,1.4914,2.4167,3.7578,1.6907,0.2577,3.0587,5.8285,4.1482,4.0735,3.3042,4.1621,2.8035,0.4558,3.4602,4.1246,0.894,1.1962,0.2215,0.8205,1.7482,2.2634,3.189,0.4111,2.824,1.2214,0.896,1.3553,2.2326,4.784,0.7463,1.4211,2.0563,0.5028,1.9447,3.5309,2.3508,1.4824,1.139,0.0743,1.0803,3.5957,3.5183,0.019,5.3379,0.1148,2.5541,0.0013,3.2601,1.6335]}

On Nov. 20, 2000, a group of students at a private school in Pennsylvania attended an outdoor meeting. They talked about his history of drug use and his interest in the law.\n\nHe played on the National Longest Man Alive Course at the course, named for World War II hero Thomas H. Sullivan. The course was so short that people who were supposed to pass it would wait for hours on top of it to complete the long run. Instead the student's golf cart spun over, and he was dropped off at the green ballroom while another student, George Gomes, played with the golf ball. George Gomes, who graduated from Pennsylvania State and led the Pennsylvania State Golf Club, was there at the ballroom and the crowd watched live TV, so some of the crowd cheered his decision. This may have meant that when he left the club on the way out, he wouldn't be there to watch the round.\n\nTo some members of the crowd, however, he was merely a quiet individual. When Gomes, who was working on the course, became drunk on the way out, he put his hand across his mouth and began pummeling his opponent with the ball. The student at the ballroom told the police. The incident caused them to cancel plans for a golf tournament, but this did nothing.\n\nHis actions did damage to the golf courses that once stood in their name and serve the public good.\n\nThe final round of the 2000 round won't include any information about PGA Tour rules in the news stories about his case.\n\nHe is the first golfer to win a championship.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2009\n\nGolf Digest Copyright \u00a9 2009.

So, how the hell do we get out of this alive?\n\nI want to say something useful to those of you who need help\n\nHere's what you can do: Start a discussion on how to make a new server that's ready to play\n\nThis could be using an admin account.\n\nInstall the right stuff.\n\nChange and refresh the config.\n\nChange the behavior based on your existing server configuration.\n\nIf it works, fix the problem.\n\nIf it doesn't work you will need to set up config files that will be run on every server.\n\nStart a new process, with a simple user, and run it for one or more sessions.\n\nThen, restart your server and you will have a new server ready for you.\n\nThis can be any new IP your server is running and working on, which will change your IP to an IP using your default IP address\n\nNow, just restart your server for three days, and make sure that the server is running well\n\nDon't feel bad for those who already set up a new service.\n\nMake a new host.\n\nNow, use the new IP to serve the server to your users, which will set them up with the way your default server is configured.\n\nNow, restart your server and test your new server.\n\nConclusion\n\nI always had a desire to start an MMO. The fact is that any hosting model can be a disaster if done badly like I will detail today, and that's when the bad ones first started popping up, and I was left wondering if I could continue to do this job in this \"real\" time at my own expense.

After 25 years of defiance, your decision to drive your own vehicle finally pays off.\n\nHowever, that decision is coming to an end on Friday. The Federal Communications Commission agreed to allow automakers to buy GM's autonomous vehicle program for the first time. The move came at a key moment of the auto industry's shift toward digital safety.\n\nThat shift came before auto executives and regulators agreed to allow public-private partnerships on the carmaker's autonomous technology to evolve from the traditional dealership model.\n\nToday's vote comes just one year after Tesla Motors (TSLA) announced self-driving car plans for North America. The company has announced a second, autonomous vehicle, the Model 9.\n\nAutonomous vehicles are currently being engineered to act more like taxis while driving themselves. But the industry has found new use for them, and a number of automakers hope that, with the new laws, they will change that, too.\n\nBut some experts suggest GM is making a mistake.\n\n\"This comes with a lot more public relations,\" said Richard Cordray, senior vice president for communications for the Auto Technology Industry Association, based in New York City.\n\n\"But it opens up a whole new field to automakers. And some of them, which will see their models change the way they talk, will do that without their cars changing anything,\" he said.\n\nThat is something that the industry's public sector unions and politicians in both parties want.\n\n\"I agree with all three that self-driving cars aren't for everyone, and we're looking at ways to expand that market if necessary,\" wrote President Obama in the National Rifle Association's annual budget report in 2012.\n\nBut GM did not commit to a vote on the regulations, opting instead to support the $8 billion GM is asking for in compensation for its participation in the program.","token_len":391,"entropy":[6.8972,2.5904,3.8061,4.1532,1.5332,10.3381,0.0526,2.5145,0.1525,8.3432,0.2422,2.4995,0.736,6.2303,5.7097,0.0574,0.5739,9.2614,0.3518,7.9348,6.7225,0.8998,1.9808,2.2341,2.2954,3.5235,7.5156,4.8,0.1857,0.4058,0.988,0.0005,5.9594,0.0487,4.4195,2.971,1.61,4.7143,1.2314,0.3699,0.7866,3.6493,3.3047,1.3688,2.0644,4.3157,2.4747,0.0008,6.4943,0.3089,3.1226,3.6129,0.1747,4.1001,4.9886,0.6953,2.8205,1.9559,1.4299,2.7963,2.4653,0.2005,0.0003,1.6975,1.6488,2.3026,3.8379,3.4076,0.5114,5.0062,0.4254,3.6751,0.8068,3.1367,0.1068,0.3471,4.4607,1.5771,6.1795,4.1438,0.7956,1.301,0.0002,4.8236,0.8989,2.8596,5.8121,5.8636,3.5721,2.4326,1.3752,4.907,0.4953,2.8097,6.1756,2.0402,0.1387,0.1377,4.5365,2.2029,5.1847,2.8313,0.0437,1.9331,2.3912,2.1704,5.5258,3.3657,2.3922,3.0194,5.3316,0.8021,0.9064,1.3787,0.0002,4.9739,2.0452,4.5177,2.4579,2.0044,2.8389,1.6972,0.132,3.0982,2.3021,2.8626,0.2168,0.0001,0.2119,2.0009,7.6616,0.0024,0.0057,1.418,3.7516,1.49,4.3609,0.2341,0.9049,1.4859,1.1211,2.0947,4.4166,2.2322,3.3043,3.4741,3.6223,1.2379,2.2606,2.2667,0.1552,6.3801,1.2578,0.6763,0.0002,4.9776,0.1713,1.0919,1.3444,3.7217,2.4811,5.6381,1.8319,4.9031,3.865,0.071,3.1644,5.3893,2.2267,2.7787,0.693,2.5202,1.955,4.1413,1.5137,4.6879,3.009,4.6383,0.3891,1.4773,1.145,2.0655,3.8715,3.3464,0.0204,1.6451,6.6538,2.047,5.041,1.2456,1.2157,2.7409,4.8313,0.5675,1.3943,1.0613,5.7419,1.2327,4.0821,0.2518,0.0281,0.1355,0.0002,4.5926,3.8166,3.1672,5.1528,4.1598,2.2337,4.377,0.9847,1.1145,0.9108,0.784,0.0001,0.6094,3.1344,5.9716,3.4848,1.053,1.6255,3.8836,5.6159,4.0599,3.2243,0.3082,4.1493,5.4125,0.1816,0.0346,2.8516,0.3955,0.0031,1.8612,4.1826,1.8644,1.3187,4.0676,4.2938,3.5677,0.3623,1.5421,5.7766,0.0402,2.4431,0.0605,1.1306,0.0389,1.1965,0.0002,1.5101,4.1998,1.7784,6.5998,0.6802,1.1906,1.643,0.5671,3.1366,2.7825,4.1176,2.2431,2.7005,5.5678,0.6976,1.7022,3.4446,5.5623,3.5759,4.7262,2.0282,4.4949,5.4027,4.1275,0.2903,0.4026,4.6694,2.0797,1.7237,4.3704,2.339,3.934,5.5257,2.3298,4.0801,3.7119,2.1017,0.4384,0.3857,0.0605,0.2305,0.0002,3.8963,3.1764,4.1768,1.1465,3.0401,1.942,3.4428,4.3624,5.7797,2.9438,2.0861,5.1028,3.3608,2.7781,0.5201,3.2042,1.6267,0.4763,0.0001,1.0168,2.3794,5.8875,0.6593,3.9815,4.7154,2.3318,4.0053,0.0182,0.0042,0.2961,4.2529,0.0002,4.464,0.5338,1.4212,1.3222,2.8396,2.1384,4.0602,0.7859,2.8609,0.2752,5.0047,2.1448,2.067,4.8521,2.9713,0.2324,6.4685,4.5715,1.2601,0.6812,3.0743,3.4875,6.3779,0.0031,0.093,2.5972,5.4148,2.9071,2.38,2.3387,0.0783,0.4147,0.0002,1.9312,2.9366,4.6361,0.3698,5.1001,0.1505,2.2023,4.9891,0.9628,0.7263,5.0452,1.8006,4.73,0.318,0.1379,4.7396,1.4499,4.8737,3.9193,0.802,3.3451,3.101,3.4933,0.4996,1.4794,5.8787,1.2549,1.2618,4.7845,0.438,0.2921,0.6774,0.2271]}

Earlier this month, the committee sent a letter to GOP candidates encouraging supporters to send out flyers and mailers and send letters of support to all three candidates\u2014Bush, Fiorina, and Johnson.\n\nThe National Rifle Association has repeatedly claimed it was created to \"protect gun owners.\" On Twitter, the group has posted pictures of images and slogans with the caption: \"Don't Shoot!..Don't Tell A Law Is No Longer A Crime!\" And on its Facebook page, it has asked GOP candidates to submit letters calling for legislation banning gun use by law abiding citizens.\n\nLast month, Johnson and Bush pledged to give up their Second Amendment rights to bear arms. And on the same day, a group called Common Cause raised eyebrows by suggesting that the NRA might be running for president.\n\nBut on October 9, the NRA issued a press statement calling the NRA's tactics \"political stunts.\"\n\n\"There is a political climate where the NRA seeks to silence all voices of thought which will negatively influence our nation and lead to our defeat.

{"id":4137,"ended":false,"length":350,"gen_text":"NSFW [ WP ] It is 2016, and Pornhub has launched their sextape in space mission. During the filming, things go horribly wrong. Pornhub makes one of its own porno films and uses these to sell ads to its audience.\n\nThis seems like a great idea and we want to keep everyone involved in the work.\n\nThis could change once people find out.\n\nWe understand that some people will get upset and say \"I see all this evidence, and believe me, I still watch porn. But then it gets interesting. Maybe it'll actually help you find a better way with your life\".\n\nBut most of us don't know why or how for any given moment.\n\nOr at least the fact that we don't know or love ourselves.\n\nPornhub has always been a great platform for free porn. It has created an excellent list of categories and filters to find some quality porn and some bad porn.\n\nI can believe that someone named \"Chad\" has a really amazing website.\n\nPornhub also recently made a public announcement about bringing \"Molly and I\". This will not only add new content, like this one.\n\nWe are hoping that you can be a part of the new porn series and enjoy the amazing porn. The videos will show you great content and great sex.\n\nIf you can donate, we will make the videos available for free for all people to download on their smart devices at any time.\n\nWhen we get the video up, we can make it available even longer without this one too.\n\nThis will make it even better.\n\nMore content and more content for free?\n\nThat will also help us in the future.

Even after you divorce it will affect your children like a curse-like punishment.'\n\nThe idea that 'America's gone white, then?' was the message of his election on February 21, 2016 when the US won 44 electoral college votes, a majority of which came from African-American voters.\n\nAccording to DeSantis, despite the Democratic convention in Cleveland, there is still no way for the Democratic party to win control of the White House.","token_len":393,"entropy":[9.2143,3.4386,9.3143,3.1577,7.7742,2.7289,2.7689,4.5457,12.64,7.7344,0.1261,11.7951,3.634,2.6186,9.5805,1.7357,2.4944,5.2241,5.6434,4.4146,2.2531,2.3098,2.3468,4.3401,2.3691,4.0822,5.3051,0.7643,0.0181,2.397,2.4629,0.302,4.9828,1.03,6.1404,1.8224,2.2692,2.608,3.223,3.5661,3.9845,0.7939,2.8703,4.564,0.8807,0.0006,3.2164,4.6932,3.3116,1.596,5.528,0.7268,4.1328,2.2831,2.5908,1.0364,4.157,1.387,5.5954,2.7666,5.667,4.4912,2.2668,0.1234,2.6876,2.6275,0.0003,0.0843,3.0021,2.3806,5.5695,1.5889,4.5693,1.3759,3.1377,5.9875,1.8819,0.3715,3.2032,3.6109,1.3007,0.7519,0.0003,0.1141,2.5081,4.4986,5.2927,0.9853,4.0521,1.2083,5.1196,1.8797,3.2969,2.8529,0.2599,0.6254,1.4277,5.5833,1.5934,3.0008,0.9777,3.2659,0.4148,1.9409,1.3471,5.7906,1.1822,2.6318,3.2926,1.8489,1.4301,3.6128,0.0085,4.5373,1.5235,2.6465,2.5254,1.4768,3.8703,0.1685,1.8097,2.0155,4.7772,1.9533,0.3893,1.3002,3.9118,1.7975,5.8649,0.6088,3.6303,0.5772,2.5429,2.368,0.579,4.7391,3.8147,2.1291,5.5549,3.0784,3.037,0.8909,1.9409,2.7533,2.9541,1.6576,0.1005,0.0002,6.8883,4.3002,0.4935,4.9765,0.7644,0.7851,5.7503,5.7632,1.2854,0.5008,3.4286,3.8494,4.3014,0.832,0.1193,0.0709,1.5714,4.9054,5.8321,4.2996,2.939,0.0521,0.0025,1.3979,1.0908,1.3741,3.5089,1.9779,1.0774,2.7801,6.2682,0.2815,5.1656,2.3427,6.0393,4.3734,3.7827,3.5477,5.7775,1.6924,3.3143,2.9978,2.3847,3.9551,5.155,0.0905,5.0991,5.6573,4.3405,0.9585,2.9764,2.7204,0.1789,0.0003,0.5975,2.863,1.8154,5.1183,3.1105,0.8351,0.0003,2.779,4.2108,2.4469,2.4588,1.9355,0.0004,2.2866,0.2509,4.2684,1.9674,1.9442,6.098,3.4339,3.3763,1.8502,3.9181,3.8853,1.6223,0.5469,0.7225,0.7481,1.0564,0.6081,1.0485,0.7763,4.6949,1.8607,4.7786,1.1391,3.3823,0.2291,1.2917,1.8205,2.7701,1.6988,1.2748,4.336,2.2927,0.7522,0.9332,6.343,4.3568,2.2047,1.0634,0.8836,0.5581,5.9861,4.4958,1.2134,4.6003,0.863,0.6455,0.0002,0.0587,2.4989,1.295,1.3367,0.1978,0.0749,0.0004,0.0626,0.3574,0.0501,0.0116,0.0238,0.0001,0.0068,0.0103,0.3252,0.0097,0.3542,0.0652,0.0044,0.0043,0.0035,0.0155,0.0044,0.0029,0.004,0.0017,0.0014,0.0042,0.0082,0.0007,0.0022,0.0011,0.0006,0.036,8.9212,0.6114,0.8178,6.9583,4.6387,2.1771,3.6495,3.4536,3.5798,5.1656,0.6646,1.5591,5.9339,1.9628,3.9434,7.0025,2.4156,4.4723,1.823,0.2147,0.0003,2.0737,5.265,1.4938,3.5601,1.8103,1.5267,4.954,4.2395,3.4789,5.7898,4.6809,2.0455,3.1877,4.8447,2.2302,3.2636,5.4104,4.9964,5.275,3.6478,0.9,0.7641,4.268,2.5242,2.8995,5.2667,4.8381,3.1683,2.0728,0.039,1.667,2.6882,3.0009,0.3609,0.766,1.1854,0.3399,3.5779,0.6226,1.0323,0.5389,0.4246,0.3712,0.0003,5.3096,0.0031,4.2884,0.0058,0.0001,0.2413,4.7777,1.5569,5.2006,4.1546,2.2279,2.3996,0.9247,3.109,2.5949,1.4502,2.0914,4.5942,1.1258,1.8055,3.4598,1.5668,0.1613,1.2607,3.7973,0.0265,0.4014,1.2943,0.0069,1.0646]}

''\n\nHis daughter was in the kitchen when she learned that the scientists had sent a message to Einstein. In short: he did not know how to make a new light bulb in ten minutes.\n\nThis wasn't the first time that science had been lost. In 1750, after learning that James A. Lawrence didn't live until 1844 and he had to put his head up and give up writing, his mother was convinced that him being an illiterate and so decided to set up an independent laboratory. The scientific community would follow her for years, and as the work would be published the scientist's name fell into use. In 1848, with a large group of fellow scientists in the group in 1852, the scientist was promoted to Assistant Professor of Science, and the research group started and led by John Gardner. As part of their research, however, the group became concerned about Richard Wilkinson ; his reputation for being so ignorant of the facts might lead the group into a position of total denial. This was not to dissuade the scientist from doing what he knew best; he was able to show that his discoveries could be made using only one source. When Gardner finished, he returned two pairs of glasses and started working on other experiments. However, after four years working on the experiment, and despite Gardner trying to get the group's approval for a few more projects, they were no longer members as they had never done before. Gardner had now done this to many different groups, and he died in 1862.\n\nThis article was originally published by The American Scientist. Copyright 2018 by The American Science Foundation.

As researchers begin trying to understand the life of the oceans, they will need to do a little more research as they find more important details that might help us understand this mysterious and extremely complex planet.\n\nIf you liked this article, you might also enjoy:\n\nThe Mysterious World of Pluto\n\nThe First Earth Asteroid Appears in Photos of Pluto\n\nThe Mysterious Life of Pluto\n\nThe Pluto-Newton Quark Nebula is the first rocky exoplanet to appear on Earth.","token_len":395,"entropy":[9.0921,0.0863,4.7504,0.7782,9.5139,3.5903,5.3644,1.0471,4.9899,0.5888,5.9574,10.295,4.0931,1.4215,2.4031,1.4172,7.8854,0.5439,0.8861,8.3936,4.7655,8.248,7.2585,4.9483,1.1124,9.2032,11.8337,4.0084,6.5079,4.4138,4.3109,0.7456,1.4832,4.3309,1.3098,0.0029,3.2978,3.4409,0.0534,4.0146,1.4614,4.7775,1.8052,0.1953,3.3144,2.3295,0.8431,1.7976,3.9955,4.7742,1.8698,5.0872,6.0473,0.1214,1.0363,4.317,0.0433,5.1496,0.1579,0.7492,2.7185,6.6556,5.3112,0.9317,3.3126,1.5224,1.3076,0.8872,4.5478,1.1328,2.382,0.9959,3.9181,3.3067,5.3812,0.6487,0.9062,0.998,2.9745,3.0873,5.2129,2.8701,3.9786,5.119,3.3038,4.187,4.8781,3.7638,2.8302,0.5073,1.5321,0.0003,2.3002,3.875,3.98,2.0601,3.1585,1.4354,3.3105,5.7143,2.9859,4.9393,2.5522,1.3431,2.738,4.2697,0.3754,5.472,1.8104,1.5242,1.1469,0.6474,0.689,5.685,0.1378,1.3797,5.0593,2.3599,4.5727,0.3797,3.2118,5.0044,1.6584,3.0339,2.4841,2.5099,2.9103,1.9522,3.8153,3.6229,2.4741,1.7929,0.4136,5.0537,0.2848,2.2766,0.9343,2.9204,2.2039,3.4465,3.3862,4.0938,3.1554,1.0462,0.3056,4.7678,0.0,0.0017,0.8517,0.8837,0.0003,1.93,2.2002,3.2627,1.9314,0.846,4.0668,3.8132,0.0007,0.6233,1.6527,2.0028,1.1044,1.4898,0.8612,4.2922,3.9424,1.3454,1.5548,0.7571,2.4703,2.2159,3.4068,2.162,2.1213,3.7072,3.5501,3.1278,4.2696,2.4111,0.4057,3.0937,2.7871,2.6873,3.521,0.0004,1.0269,1.3232,6.0177,3.4193,4.443,4.0547,0.7173,2.4938,1.3032,3.318,4.2528,0.0652,1.9681,0.3164,5.2789,5.4126,0.0008,1.3834,1.4129,0.1307,1.4665,4.7631,2.4775,3.6182,6.4464,1.3045,1.4087,5.7932,3.4834,0.7168,4.8891,3.8982,0.9435,5.0526,0.0482,0.0004,0.0001,3.6366,1.5681,2.4152,6.3369,0.0023,0.5102,4.317,4.5215,4.0456,1.5213,3.8724,4.0898,0.5272,0.8839,4.639,4.2005,0.0041,0.8095,5.9275,1.2828,1.8679,4.6738,1.822,3.5265,1.974,0.7478,2.2865,0.784,3.6635,1.1667,0.0936,0.3695,0.0002,3.416,0.6896,0.0002,1.8842,4.6834,0.8433,1.8217,1.7473,0.6274,0.2097,2.6248,4.7182,1.1708,0.126,4.2484,6.6573,3.9223,2.975,3.2199,2.3217,0.6721,4.8039,5.5001,0.9493,1.3652,0.3985,5.6374,3.1804,2.6314,5.3894,9.868,5.5564,2.994,0.3879,0.1167,1.0108,5.5768,1.8528,4.0848,5.5714,4.565,5.6335,0.1175,1.8405,1.1401,3.8434,1.2423,1.4786,2.8534,0.4014,1.1304,1.745,2.0371,0.3045,4.3468,1.8167,2.6241,0.9822,1.1681,5.2734,3.2767,4.8081,1.7521,5.5696,3.71,3.783,2.4475,0.8943,1.7534,1.195,4.5028,2.619,3.4408,5.8674,1.9283,2.7757,0.1721,0.5685,0.0003,4.267,0.5368,1.7842,0.0225,0.9537,0.314,1.0461,0.3028,0.0161,0.1504,0.5447,0.1171,0.0004,4.345,4.242,3.6116,0.1462,3.5046,0.7361,0.0003,1.8802,4.8341,3.9781,4.2004,0.1081,4.4861,1.1897,4.0836,2.8466,1.1834,0.4144,0.0005,1.8951,2.3783,4.0544,0.2667,1.2464,0.8396,0.0004,1.5271,6.0539,3.3297,5.7109,0.3392,4.2496,1.2454,4.8306,3.8486,1.705,3.6108,5.1785,3.1376,0.0247,0.0148,0.9449,3.1431,2.1905,0.8925,1.1391]}
{"id":3172,"ended":true,"length":371,"gen_text":"You are the director of the agency that, every fifty years, exchanges communication with a civilization fifty light-years from Earth. This time, however, there is no response.\n\nIn fact, in the year 2000, the first atomic bomb dropped by the United States in response to the Cuban missile crisis, there was no reply.\n\nMoreover, the time it took America to launch its nuclear weapons against Cuba was much longer. According to estimates, before Hiroshima and Nagasaki the United States had expended only about a second of its nuclear warhead. According to estimates, between 1948 and 1950 the total amount of nuclear waste accumulated by the American military has risen from more than one-third to more than 80 times that of any major power.\n\nBy 1945, the United States had spent half its energy on its nuclear arsenal and a quarter more on missiles. Although the American people had long thought of this as an excellent achievement, it soon began to feel that it was a waste of money. In 1960, the Congressional Budget Office reported that the United States spent \u00a320 billion on nuclear arms.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1967 the Cold War had reached a close as the Americans began to lose credibility as nuclear powers. By 1970, when the Soviet Union began to develop advanced nuclear designs, its strategic nuclear arms were beginning to fail.\n\nIn this context, the two major debates centered around whether there were any serious reasons for avoiding nuclear arsenals. On the one hand, both sides claim that nuclear power is a necessity for peace and security in world affairs, while at the same time, the others argue that it will inevitably lead to conflicts and will only become a threat if it becomes available to the American people. The current debate has been the result of years of negotiations, and in 2007 the decision by President Barack Obama to sign into law the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was announced as a clear sign that the United States must stop its military adventurism.","token_len":395,"entropy":[3.8828,3.2036,6.7035,0.2646,1.1991,6.0018,1.7042,6.4003,7.326,9.4056,0.3642,0.407,11.0972,8.0914,0.9194,2.8,9.1574,10.8046,6.9516,4.0072,0.0111,2.4242,0.814,0.8229,3.6033,4.8567,0.6589,3.1054,0.0026,2.8999,0.7901,1.5241,5.9976,0.7366,2.344,0.0159,3.4036,2.8409,0.0353,3.6464,1.5141,4.2311,2.0003,0.1993,1.4015,4.2542,6.2665,0.524,3.3668,2.3367,0.8277,0.8087,0.0205,3.487,3.5064,0.0091,1.0748,4.1652,1.6112,0.0357,1.2575,3.0597,0.7073,0.5288,3.0763,0.5233,1.2888,0.0002,6.2931,0.0093,1.4794,5.6878,3.6901,0.6244,5.6352,0.2515,3.1964,1.4084,2.5649,1.2436,2.4038,1.0274,0.8173,3.8755,0.9967,1.8835,4.6786,0.0016,4.4028,1.0856,4.5903,6.0779,1.0496,0.0243,0.0001,3.3488,0.8908,0.0047,0.7625,5.1871,3.2243,2.0944,2.8196,5.1865,0.2827,0.1736,1.6033,4.6189,0.1101,0.9254,5.0524,0.0018,2.827,0.9009,3.7865,4.7958,0.0335,2.3066,1.4949,3.841,1.9734,0.2796,1.3207,2.8505,3.1383,1.218,0.272,4.1478,1.1565,4.801,2.8682,1.6624,4.5596,0.0145,2.6607,1.5057,0.9293,0.8988,1.2871,0.0047,6.3616,3.866,1.4654,1.0997,4.2238,5.9986,2.5697,0.4086,0.5068,0.0002,4.8486,4.5649,0.3371,1.0208,0.9913,0.0072,0.4359,2.0089,4.2961,1.4062,3.2906,0.9807,2.8349,1.0478,2.2354,1.9491,4.2422,2.0382,5.3565,0.1029,4.0782,0.727,5.5759,1.0409,3.5281,3.6853,1.8393,3.3394,3.7851,1.3317,4.1193,1.1098,2.1013,5.0841,5.1401,0.246,1.508,4.8282,4.2365,0.0889,2.5867,1.2169,1.4314,0.4612,2.2585,2.5524,0.4228,1.8051,0.7139,2.684,5.087,0.3942,1.1472,4.1649,0.5401,0.0048,2.7974,0.1177,0.9322,1.2071,0.0032,1.3188,6.214,4.18,0.4105,1.1332,2.0072,3.596,1.753,1.0274,0.0002,5.5331,0.0767,2.2919,4.1833,1.8528,6.0527,0.0029,2.2532,3.2414,1.2389,4.5453,4.4514,0.8972,5.8205,1.6607,0.5036,3.9697,4.806,2.362,4.541,1.9935,0.472,3.4148,2.4406,0.4487,3.4892,0.7355,1.8233,0.046,2.2733,0.532,3.1562,3.6775,0.9084,6.7633,0.2541,4.2734,4.2532,1.6343,4.1887,1.7867,3.8225,0.0074,3.8391,0.5595,1.0837,0.0002,1.8109,3.827,2.4931,0.0903,1.1029,5.6357,2.695,5.8942,6.0681,0.8678,2.336,4.3289,2.4467,1.6653,3.6233,5.286,0.7561,6.4152,1.8686,5.8968,0.0004,0.6349,3.5306,0.3389,0.0246,0.0078,0.0294,5.9358,0.6819,4.6746,0.3587,2.9233,4.0736,1.0772,1.8784,4.1856,1.3121,2.5253,0.8911,1.7078,2.2719,5.6599,0.2511,1.5579,1.801,3.6759,0.0045,0.0102,0.0011,1.6507,1.5162,6.5304,1.9861,0.0856,1.1596,4.4071,3.9365,0.6331,0.0336,4.6633,1.7011,4.7715,3.5672,3.7847,2.4145,2.1818,1.4901,1.8538,2.5498,1.8827,1.3163,1.3579,3.6567,0.0821,0.2886,3.0634,5.5644,1.4043,2.4815,1.792,4.099,2.6723,0.0236,4.4284,0.0194,4.1459,1.7953,2.6306,3.5271,6.0636,1.4671,6.0485,2.2702,2.33,2.3251,0.0034,0.2155,4.3823,2.7555,0.0014,0.6768,1.8318,0.1218,0.8467,0.0329,0.0,0.0,0.0382,1.7943,3.0992,3.6048,1.1008,5.3273,3.145,0.8051,0.9523,0.6504,0.0012,4.0087,2.9706,2.1446,3.9578,3.7824,0.1665,0.0217,0.5874]}

What are the goals we want to accomplish? Who or what should we spend our money on?\n\nand will it have been good enough for Critic to consider that he had some interesting ideas in the game? or have he just spent too much money (or money alone) to get this? I think so. As for my final score, I highly doubt this was the final score. If any one of you had any opinions, suggestions, or comments concerning the game, do them come into my head with little less than a moment. And I really hope some of you got some good advice from my honest, experienced and understanding team.\n\nThank you for reading and have a happy reading.\n\nThank you!! This may be the last review of the game and I hope there will not be some new details to share from this.\n\nWe hope your journey to this game is a beautiful ride where you might even enjoy some amazing moments. I also wanted to share some thoughts and feel good about your own adventure.\n\nNow we will finish the game, and we will find out what we will do with Criticism over the next days.\n\nI've always loved Criticism. I played it almost every single day like a kid, and it's been something unique to me. I love it immensely, and I can't wait to start playing on our next adventure. So this is a very special thing. One that I will absolutely have to get better at.

However upon reflection, a lot of things now make perfect sense. We're not allowed to go on a mission on the alien surface after the aliens' first interplanetary journey. If we want to see them go on, we will have to have to watch them. However, we can do this in the context of our world being one big alien colony with a few people who can share the space and have a better understanding of our culture\/society. If we follow this advice, we'll find our way home.\n\n. As part of the first meeting, the aliens share a truth with us that is devastatingly frightening. However upon reflection, a lot of things now make perfect sense. One week after Earth, there is a new threat and the Earth's gravity drops, so some of the other world's inhabitants have stopped doing science experiments. I know you're asking if it will become a problem on a daily basis like last time. But it's a risk worth having.\n\n. On the planet planet, one of the aliens meets a little girl named Shura. Shura is a little girl who is looking to be an astronaut. She lives in an asylum on the planet, and we meet her friends.\n\n\nShe looks very much like a teenage girl. As she walks out of the asylum, she gets scared and starts looking around and realizes that something terrible has happened to her parents - She has no memories. The aliens see this and kill her so she makes her return to the asylum. After the aliens attack, her family have to flee to Earth.
