{"id":3548,"ended":true,"length":385,"gen_text":"A country no one thought would win the World Cup does, you write about the chaotic and humorous aftermath that occurs in response to the latest drama that has gripped the game.\n\nThen the players lose their lives because of the violence. Many have been brutally beaten and killed by cops, and that's really what it's all about. As you can imagine, we're really disappointed about the outcome.\n\nThe game is actually very simple. The only information on each player is from where he got picked up and placed. The game is completely private. We have no idea why you'd choose to read that information. You could call it a plot twist or a fake news report. We're not sure what this story is, which is why we don't know how much time it takes players to decide who they will play with.\n\nThe story starts out fairly easy, but soon things really start to pile up and the players find out they won't get to play in a very big tournament.\n\nThe real purpose of the game is to spread love and good humor, and not just any kind of \"trolling.\" It's not some kind of real life horror movie.\n\nWe thought that was pretty great, but we didn't want to be one of those movies, so we created something so scary that we only showed it on YouTube.\n\nAfter watching the videos, we figured if this game made you more comfortable with the life you could play at home you would start to enjoy it more.\n\nThere are so many beautiful characters and monsters, and you come out at least a little more confident when you see them in your daily life, and you can play a bunch of characters you love so much.

But many people still believe it's right, even the bad ones, if it's just a matter of the facts.\n\nAn earlier article in Georgia magazine said \"the state of Georgia has never gone through such a thing before.\"\n\nGeorgia has since legalized self-defense and many people say police are being wrong.\n\nCopyright Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https:\/\/usat.ly\/2y1KcCf","token_len":402,"entropy":[8.4596,6.3236,2.2239,6.4931,8.3396,8.9434,5.7659,1.6173,5.1655,1.8688,10.8126,1.583,1.334,11.8413,2.2442,0.0022,1.3962,3.8601,7.6253,5.627,1.151,5.5582,1.8934,0.6968,1.0172,2.9867,0.7274,0.5758,5.0019,2.7956,5.3263,3.0088,0.0011,4.8272,0.541,5.4393,0.9438,1.0865,5.282,1.2143,0.8906,3.7911,2.2119,2.2788,4.6918,3.1518,2.9842,1.8542,1.2674,2.0521,1.0,4.2206,0.7449,0.2391,2.0573,2.2726,1.1408,2.6018,5.5003,0.001,0.4153,3.5905,2.571,5.2399,0.3707,0.405,0.0467,4.7651,3.7494,0.5524,0.0007,4.5681,1.9109,2.4164,3.66,2.6908,4.0194,3.8373,1.4828,3.1573,1.0082,0.6658,1.6334,0.0003,2.0837,1.5349,5.7655,4.2878,3.7638,0.9834,0.3738,1.868,0.6212,1.7257,5.9075,2.0847,3.2854,0.1906,5.1944,0.2284,2.173,4.4123,0.1014,6.0546,2.8903,2.2301,3.7448,0.9426,1.5953,3.2735,0.871,1.9853,2.8227,4.2224,2.4173,5.0648,5.8872,1.055,0.3579,5.1391,1.715,3.5035,3.3321,1.2193,4.5866,4.8329,1.3281,3.0256,3.1862,0.9041,0.7841,3.3644,0.5015,2.2891,4.9695,0.1569,0.1693,0.161,0.7892,0.0002,4.7646,2.9327,4.316,0.5218,0.0004,2.7076,4.8733,4.2961,4.7919,2.1865,2.0977,4.8678,0.2961,1.8401,3.0422,2.8813,1.0076,1.0017,0.6344,1.1696,0.178,1.008,0.6669,0.53,1.6257,1.7858,0.0003,3.5095,0.9213,3.7724,6.02,0.2219,1.7077,4.223,4.8887,4.8606,0.0045,0.1183,5.3795,1.1274,0.4074,1.578,5.0444,5.4167,3.947,5.3034,4.1586,1.1405,4.2699,0.6779,0.0003,1.3397,0.0382,5.1534,3.6532,5.4273,4.6486,1.3626,3.1691,1.6876,5.5392,3.7181,3.2255,2.5756,0.4971,3.1412,1.924,6.3171,0.0232,0.0227,0.0275,0.0007,4.4445,2.3804,2.6793,3.142,0.0002,6.4,5.4419,3.0164,1.1861,5.9057,0.3815,5.3934,3.3248,4.4387,2.6489,4.9965,2.546,4.448,2.3299,1.5943,0.0002,4.9745,3.1479,5.0384,2.0712,0.1201,0.0169,4.6147,4.866,2.6607,0.3129,4.7822,1.5694,4.3451,5.7817,1.9354,0.9297,2.099,2.2548,2.3904,0.0837,2.5307,3.2577,0.0144,2.1948,1.732,0.3233,0.1809,0.4684,0.0002,3.6744,5.3878,4.6539,1.0613,2.9935,3.9335,0.585,2.6981,1.8322,5.0332,3.3205,3.3508,0.0112,2.4574,0.0005,1.399,2.5935,0.1829,1.5625,5.2027,0.7438,2.3055,0.0199,0.7263,0.2371,3.8153,3.0144,0.0551,0.0175,2.0112,5.9596,0.1982,1.7329,0.3044,2.6945,4.7331,0.0017,0.0027,0.005,0.137,0.0049,4.0895,5.3812,4.0642,0.0863,0.6961,4.6443,1.1678,3.7198,4.7171,2.7248,1.9906,1.8695,1.8232,0.9983,3.9853,2.2818,1.8529,4.4737,4.3846,1.7305,1.7223,4.6399,2.3709,1.3963,3.263,1.8724,1.4078,0.0018,4.6323,2.8418,0.343,0.3329,0.0002,5.9189,3.9812,4.7474,1.6078,3.8662,4.6322,2.7018,3.8018,2.1292,2.9446,2.2917,0.0557,1.7323,4.0247,5.1606,2.7903,2.2277,0.7085,5.3159,2.2911,0.715,1.063,0.0002,3.9105,2.3601,5.4451,2.964,2.963,0.002,0.0211,2.9708,4.2264,1.4857,3.1722,5.0517,2.4668,4.037,3.8091,1.2924,0.9218,0.0002,4.9438,2.9943,0.0004,5.0642,0.0002,1.3875,0.0049,0.0,0.0004,0.0005,0.0001,2.6931,0.0001,0.887,0.0001,0.0001,0.0002,0.3809,3.9799,4.0593,4.2008,4.2708,4.2886,3.9085]}

As part of its research, the company also has taken a concept known as Mars Mars Batteries, which aims to make hydrogen-based solar cells.\n\nBut when it was launched from the International Space Station, it proved too costly for American astronauts.\n\nThe company eventually launched a Dragon capsule in 2012, one of the first manned orbital spacecraft which will see Earth in orbit.\n\nThe Soyuz rocket, which is expected to carry a crew of 3 and provide for more than 1,900 hours of operational flights over the next two years, could provide the first flight to Mars after three decades.\n\nThe commercial spaceflight will only become competitive once more, when the company announces that it will buy Virgin Galactic for $5 billion.\n\nAn earlier article in Space magazine said that Virgin Galactic is buying ULA for $40 billion in 2017, which was supposed to provide a new revenue strategy for Virgin Atlantic.\n\nThe Virgin shares also jumped 5%.","token_len":404,"entropy":[11.5665,0.2018,1.5802,7.4686,12.4264,3.294,2.1436,5.9141,4.266,8.2008,1.1339,8.6941,3.6666,1.9367,1.0858,2.81,0.0069,0.2815,1.2842,3.6766,9.0755,5.0318,5.427,0.0067,8.547,2.6101,6.8216,1.202,5.8721,3.7542,3.7054,6.5513,2.6451,6.3147,9.6536,3.1404,8.5309,1.1934,2.1591,3.7416,1.1229,1.6224,0.0003,5.9378,0.0588,4.6305,3.864,2.8417,5.9637,1.5847,0.6638,0.7569,3.6823,1.383,5.3681,2.0592,1.7078,0.0002,2.1119,5.5217,5.6573,5.1402,0.0001,4.4371,2.0874,4.4584,4.541,3.0592,0.6027,2.9579,6.2534,0.2441,3.2667,0.9996,3.5272,3.9262,4.3562,0.7612,3.1602,3.7121,0.0935,0.5577,0.0671,1.2945,1.6392,0.1206,1.1918,4.1157,5.1271,2.9378,1.0066,0.0002,2.3523,3.2597,0.1873,5.5044,1.4119,2.3991,1.5943,0.7486,5.374,1.4777,2.4843,0.7124,1.3342,2.3137,0.0001,3.4817,2.7011,2.4109,4.1583,4.8137,0.5586,1.0298,3.0265,1.3047,2.094,0.007,2.7204,5.4277,4.2753,4.4578,7.4131,0.2349,5.7094,1.3032,1.1956,6.0736,0.0265,0.5641,0.8234,2.42,2.0056,3.1234,4.3104,4.428,2.8323,0.0543,2.1829,2.5527,3.9837,3.4589,2.3721,0.3671,0.7697,0.1294,0.5914,6.0607,2.4815,0.4495,0.3879,0.0002,4.2112,1.9083,2.1278,3.5973,0.088,0.6831,6.558,0.632,0.4773,1.525,1.8051,2.3622,2.1042,5.2891,5.748,4.0971,1.419,2.4335,0.456,2.2879,3.3123,0.0032,6.3926,6.517,2.0446,3.5048,0.5672,5.5353,1.7269,1.5128,2.1554,3.1499,3.146,3.5694,0.4039,4.9803,1.1091,2.5178,0.1107,3.1777,3.3621,0.4117,1.5697,0.0137,5.7538,1.7386,2.9243,1.7079,1.3398,4.0144,2.9341,5.594,5.6101,0.3599,0.2168,7.1175,3.6297,0.001,1.1075,4.5549,0.7849,1.6991,0.7688,2.9648,2.7114,5.43,1.4997,5.8275,5.439,0.009,4.9002,6.0073,5.9788,1.3485,0.016,1.1978,0.823,4.197,0.0422,2.9542,5.7775,1.3919,1.2576,2.5238,0.4615,2.1794,0.1733,0.0001,3.5504,5.0581,1.2011,3.3062,1.5675,3.0522,1.5766,0.8686,0.0023,0.0016,1.301,1.2711,4.5716,3.3977,3.2535,1.4353,6.1737,1.7089,1.0663,0.959,0.0001,2.1068,1.8538,4.5963,4.4019,1.5744,3.914,0.9439,2.3021,2.3975,0.9415,6.3282,0.7352,0.8864,0.5636,2.556,4.3771,3.4003,6.6454,2.9623,5.5637,3.7178,2.4574,1.5916,1.3016,0.7165,0.0002,1.9484,6.1309,0.0,1.9649,2.2216,1.1534,1.5433,3.3236,0.0139,3.0458,2.0764,1.1991,0.1685,4.179,3.638,6.0869,3.3977,4.0267,0.2523,2.7557,0.434,4.8629,2.5782,0.1211,4.9936,2.7693,2.9977,0.4768,0.5176,2.5452,0.6923,0.0653,4.8648,3.6431,2.2619,1.4585,4.3557,1.3743,0.4841,4.6502,4.9268,2.5686,1.0185,0.2317,0.0002,1.8814,4.628,0.9205,1.8049,6.6828,5.3554,3.3394,4.8071,2.4363,2.3192,1.0604,2.5838,1.3315,3.2879,4.889,2.7042,0.4753,0.7316,4.247,5.452,0.026,1.1897,0.5199,3.2421,0.7292,0.9255,0.4349,0.0002,5.7076,4.6749,5.8368,1.4789,2.5452,3.692,2.2903,0.6111,2.409,0.31,1.8531,5.2255,5.6876,1.5331,0.3008,0.2802,4.7383,0.1479,3.5261,3.5077,1.4346,2.0628,3.5569,5.6009,0.0022,4.8655,1.9105,3.6982,3.9649,8.2695,0.6438,3.0737,6.5549,0.7234,0.5049,0.0002,2.3043,4.0027,5.2283,4.298,3.693,3.8638,3.8376]}

As part of its research, the company also has taken a concept known as Mars Mars Batteries, which aims to make hydrogen-based solar cells.\n\nBut when it was launched from the International Space Station, it proved too costly for American astronauts.\n\nThe company eventually launched a Dragon capsule in 2012, one of the first manned orbital spacecraft which will see Earth in orbit.\n\nThe Soyuz rocket, which is expected to carry a crew of 3 and provide for more than 1,900 hours of operational flights over the next two years, could provide the first flight to Mars after three decades.\n\nThe commercial spaceflight will only become competitive once more, when the company announces that it will buy Virgin Galactic for $5 billion.\n\nAn earlier article in Space magazine said that Virgin Galactic is buying ULA for $40 billion in 2017, which was supposed to provide a new revenue strategy for Virgin Atlantic.\n\nThe Virgin shares also jumped 5%.","token_len":404,"entropy":[11.5665,0.2018,1.5802,7.4686,12.4264,3.294,2.1436,5.9141,4.266,8.2008,1.1339,8.6941,3.6666,1.9367,1.0858,2.81,0.0069,0.2815,1.2842,3.6766,9.0755,5.0318,5.427,0.0067,8.547,2.6101,6.8216,1.202,5.8721,3.7542,3.7054,6.5513,2.6451,6.3147,9.6536,3.1404,8.5309,1.1934,2.1591,3.7416,1.1229,1.6224,0.0003,5.9378,0.0588,4.6305,3.864,2.8417,5.9637,1.5847,0.6638,0.7569,3.6823,1.383,5.3681,2.0592,1.7078,0.0002,2.1119,5.5217,5.6573,5.1402,0.0001,4.4371,2.0874,4.4584,4.541,3.0592,0.6027,2.9579,6.2534,0.2441,3.2667,0.9996,3.5272,3.9262,4.3562,0.7612,3.1602,3.7121,0.0935,0.5577,0.0671,1.2945,1.6392,0.1206,1.1918,4.1157,5.1271,2.9378,1.0066,0.0002,2.3523,3.2597,0.1873,5.5044,1.4119,2.3991,1.5943,0.7486,5.374,1.4777,2.4843,0.7124,1.3342,2.3137,0.0001,3.4817,2.7011,2.4109,4.1583,4.8137,0.5586,1.0298,3.0265,1.3047,2.094,0.007,2.7204,5.4277,4.2753,4.4578,7.4131,0.2349,5.7094,1.3032,1.1956,6.0736,0.0265,0.5641,0.8234,2.42,2.0056,3.1234,4.3104,4.428,2.8323,0.0543,2.1829,2.5527,3.9837,3.4589,2.3721,0.3671,0.7697,0.1294,0.5914,6.0607,2.4815,0.4495,0.3879,0.0002,4.2112,1.9083,2.1278,3.5973,0.088,0.6831,6.558,0.632,0.4773,1.525,1.8051,2.3622,2.1042,5.2891,5.748,4.0971,1.419,2.4335,0.456,2.2879,3.3123,0.0032,6.3926,6.517,2.0446,3.5048,0.5672,5.5353,1.7269,1.5128,2.1554,3.1499,3.146,3.5694,0.4039,4.9803,1.1091,2.5178,0.1107,3.1777,3.3621,0.4117,1.5697,0.0137,5.7538,1.7386,2.9243,1.7079,1.3398,4.0144,2.9341,5.594,5.6101,0.3599,0.2168,7.1175,3.6297,0.001,1.1075,4.5549,0.7849,1.6991,0.7688,2.9648,2.7114,5.43,1.4997,5.8275,5.439,0.009,4.9002,6.0073,5.9788,1.3485,0.016,1.1978,0.823,4.197,0.0422,2.9542,5.7775,1.3919,1.2576,2.5238,0.4615,2.1794,0.1733,0.0001,3.5504,5.0581,1.2011,3.3062,1.5675,3.0522,1.5766,0.8686,0.0023,0.0016,1.301,1.2711,4.5716,3.3977,3.2535,1.4353,6.1737,1.7089,1.0663,0.959,0.0001,2.1068,1.8538,4.5963,4.4019,1.5744,3.914,0.9439,2.3021,2.3975,0.9415,6.3282,0.7352,0.8864,0.5636,2.556,4.3771,3.4003,6.6454,2.9623,5.5637,3.7178,2.4574,1.5916,1.3016,0.7165,0.0002,1.9484,6.1309,0.0,1.9649,2.2216,1.1534,1.5433,3.3236,0.0139,3.0458,2.0764,1.1991,0.1685,4.179,3.638,6.0869,3.3977,4.0267,0.2523,2.7557,0.434,4.8629,2.5782,0.1211,4.9936,2.7693,2.9977,0.4768,0.5176,2.5452,0.6923,0.0653,4.8648,3.6431,2.2619,1.4585,4.3557,1.3743,0.4841,4.6502,4.9268,2.5686,1.0185,0.2317,0.0002,1.8814,4.628,0.9205,1.8049,6.6828,5.3554,3.3394,4.8071,2.4363,2.3192,1.0604,2.5838,1.3315,3.2879,4.889,2.7042,0.4753,0.7316,4.247,5.452,0.026,1.1897,0.5199,3.2421,0.7292,0.9255,0.4349,0.0002,5.7076,4.6749,5.8368,1.4789,2.5452,3.692,2.2903,0.6111,2.409,0.31,1.8531,5.2255,5.6876,1.5331,0.3008,0.2802,4.7383,0.1479,3.5261,3.5077,1.4346,2.0628,3.5569,5.6009,0.0022,4.8655,1.9105,3.6982,3.9649,8.2695,0.6438,3.0737,6.5549,0.7234,0.5049,0.0002,2.3043,4.0027,5.2283,4.298,3.693,3.8638,3.8376]}

It worked. \" 'God has promised us eternal life.'\"\n\n\nIt goes without saying that most Christian women did not say this: for I feel sorry for those women who didn't write in their own words: \"This could have been an abortion.\" But God has given us the freedom to choose our own fate. He may have created us in the body of what he wanted us to be. But if we chose to live in the world of Christianity, he will surely love us so that all people who were raised this way could have a better future.\n\n\nHe is a great guy with a perfect sense of humor: his stories have long reminded me of the God who made me who I am: the love and hope that makes me who I am and my heart can beat when I stand on a lonely and lonely sea of sin. As far as I can tell, he also has a profound fascination with the things that his friends say about his life and make them proud.\n\n\nIt wasn't long before I realized that not every Christian woman I met had such a fascination with his life. But it was very easy to see where he was headed: one could read all about him, which was so refreshing.\n\n\nOne may think I am being a little pedantic here. My wife has an amazing book she is reading every day on Christian women. My life has been so incredible, even at the point that I am writing an entire book. What a fascinating book for me, and a wonderful book for our family.\n\n\nBut it's just my view. The more I read, the more I realize that this story I want to tell is my own. It has been in the back of my mind for as long as my life is around. But now that we are married, we have one child together, and we will not hesitate to share it with our children. He will grow up with us.

{"id":184,"ended":false,"length":377,"gen_text":"Weapons become more powerful the older they get. Modern guns will barely give someone a scratch but an ancient spear can devastate armies.\n\n. Modern guns are the largest ever mounted on a weapon. Even the most powerful modern guns have a fixed blade for a great deal of battle.\n\n. The first major weapon of a modern shooter comes into play on the opening click action. The second major weapon is the ultimate weapon and thus the strongest.\n\nThe gun on the right is actually quite special for a modern shooter. The barrel is so deep that the gun looks like a superheated tin can or a bucket. To the left, the handle is on a plastic handguard that is completely wrapped with leather. A few of the parts may have long hairs on them.\n\n, and the trigger is a pair of long, long, large round chokes that are very durable but also really powerful. Also, the trigger release can be very short, so there is a big problem with the slide.\n\nand so on. The second major hammer\/saw is found on the left in any gun with which I have tried. Not as small as the real thing but close enough so that it is visible.\n\n. I found a pair of very good wooden saws in the factory, which will set you right at the start of practice.\n\nThe \"Bud-like\" action is an amazing piece of history.

{"id":231,"ended":false,"length":357,"gen_text":"Poseidon's Trident, 'which has a more powerful attack than those of the Sea Kings', but it can still be beaten with any bow and arrows. Its main drawbacks are high health and a wide spread of health potions as well as a few spells with powerful effects. The only drawbacks are that its defense is not very reliable compared to other spells and that it is very expensive, and this is partly because of its low health. In the end it's best taken with a Sword of Honor so that it will stay up to speed if you have one.\n\nInventory Edit\n\nItems Edit\n\nDagger : Dagger: 1 level: 32: 9\n\n: Dagger: 1 level: 28: 20\n\n: Dagger: 1 level: 30: 18\n\n: Dagger: 1 level: 33: 13\n\n: Dagger: 1 level: 36: 16\n\nNotes Edit\n\nThe Bow-Ard are the only weapons with decent stats. Also, while in any of the Dharvaic races, they have a higher chance of hitting you.\n\nThis weapon is only able to be used once per day.\n\nIn the first chapter, this weapon also goes up on the quest.\n\nThe Sword is the only weapon with an HP increase based on health, and increases defense.\n\nEven though there is no attack limit on this weapon, due to that the game doesn't allow players to change it.\n\nThe Bow\/Shield can be used once per spell when the Bow\/Shield reaches level 28, and only can be wielded once per level on the quest, as noted above.\n\nBugs Edit\n\nThere is a bug where a sword in your inventory when unequipped will not do the right amount of damage. On most machines you cannot unequip an unread weapon.\n\nwhen you unequip an unread weapon. If you move when you are about to equip it, you will not be able to use it when your game begins.\n\nGallery Edit","token_len":412,"entropy":[8.4866,1.7726,2.7854,8.1345,2.4482,7.1483,4.709,3.2126,2.3057,5.8846,2.0136,4.5252,1.3591,5.8179,0.5812,0.9822,5.1828,3.3063,1.3354,3.8049,2.4344,3.227,2.9103,0.9198,5.1802,1.5683,4.8461,3.8137,1.7378,2.4067,1.2385,4.3609,3.7024,5.0495,0.3196,5.4905,3.7978,0.9441,2.6323,5.3221,3.7924,0.3788,3.9241,3.8141,5.3936,0.4647,0.0656,1.6799,3.3605,3.7071,3.9606,5.171,0.8936,0.6791,2.4458,2.2431,4.7675,0.6717,1.2278,2.4148,4.847,0.6327,3.2595,1.811,4.8394,4.5022,0.0908,1.2912,4.5094,1.9499,1.8346,0.8098,1.4805,2.4705,3.2597,2.5266,2.3672,4.0721,1.0456,5.1977,1.2023,1.0725,1.0199,2.3359,2.1651,0.6769,4.0117,2.1771,1.1824,2.2503,3.2958,2.7192,5.978,0.9705,1.0863,5.4657,1.1258,5.3703,5.6512,1.388,1.277,2.8025,4.9456,3.6825,2.1035,2.9849,3.8036,1.2091,2.7576,3.825,0.7401,0.9116,0.0428,3.9986,4.8593,0.3501,0.0343,0.0002,4.8936,1.4628,0.1032,0.0002,5.1462,1.6004,4.5973,4.0573,4.786,3.101,6.2082,4.0242,5.816,5.996,4.5839,2.0555,0.0003,0.1975,0.0524,0.0058,0.112,0.0011,0.0008,7.5538,0.0027,4.0407,0.1155,0.0001,0.2528,0.0811,0.0021,0.2687,0.0012,0.001,2.9799,0.0014,3.3014,0.2074,0.0001,1.8811,0.2487,0.0041,0.1442,0.0017,0.0009,3.1194,0.0011,2.7371,0.0884,0.0001,2.1038,0.1667,0.0033,0.0958,0.0018,0.0008,1.5416,0.0013,3.4947,0.0858,0.0001,2.516,0.0887,0.1958,0.0002,2.061,4.6266,4.8035,4.3229,4.5676,5.918,2.3776,0.9526,1.7417,2.6761,4.9247,2.0205,1.0284,5.3302,0.7194,4.6477,4.7186,6.1939,2.0243,0.211,5.6549,5.8575,3.7152,1.5708,5.6368,0.5322,1.4889,2.0287,1.5243,2.6873,1.5391,0.5713,3.1444,2.8626,2.0109,0.7982,0.0002,3.8883,1.7987,1.0978,3.3087,5.0869,0.0036,1.0417,1.3002,2.9257,0.8778,1.7198,0.9319,0.7648,0.0002,3.4308,1.7115,4.0729,4.0973,1.1455,3.8548,0.4083,5.0925,5.7915,2.5994,4.1943,1.7507,3.9696,3.5854,0.6919,0.0002,2.486,2.9906,3.0545,1.5347,0.4475,0.4804,1.6297,2.9235,5.2019,3.9261,5.6745,0.0657,5.4101,2.2258,1.8103,5.7069,5.9167,1.5232,0.5595,0.0002,5.678,0.7848,4.1749,0.9984,0.9651,4.4546,5.3011,2.0506,0.8895,0.1697,0.1665,5.6624,0.0032,4.9505,2.6601,5.197,3.4759,0.001,2.2825,3.5028,0.0378,3.2307,2.4758,1.5633,0.4983,0.0002,2.0143,2.2118,6.075,3.2347,3.0613,0.6964,1.2743,3.3643,0.2811,6.0462,4.8463,2.4455,5.2821,2.6558,0.1408,5.5311,1.137,3.9906,1.6149,1.3891,3.4344,5.0294,0.2801,5.0442,1.5904,0.3989,3.5953,4.3492,1.1224,1.0767,2.9439,2.7192,5.5533,1.3775,0.0976,0.3086,0.0002,5.0542,1.541,0.0009,0.1945,0.0003,3.9424,0.7239,0.7406,0.6053,1.0742,3.4821,3.7867,4.1128,3.7242,0.2967,4.2226,3.1987,0.7438,1.0198,1.2957,4.8587,2.2706,4.046,2.8111,0.0156,0.0791,0.9776,5.7447,4.5371,3.5379,4.2081,3.629,2.4269,0.0095,4.1935,3.425,4.7917,1.0221,1.2147,1.1145,0.0003,5.2014,3.3041,0.8996,0.1635,0.0474,0.0417,0.0003,0.0079,0.0021,2.4646,0.5345,5.7044,4.5979,1.4178,2.0414,3.7164,0.0041,2.1104,2.6154,0.4393,1.8859,0.4705,1.6789,0.8842,0.1047,0.0019,2.0698,0.6704,3.1721,3.426,6.0422,4.2691,0.4187,0.6589,0.0002,5.3151,0.0019]}

The more stories you're doing, the less money you're putting into these products.\n\nThis seems like a great idea and we want you to write to yourself asking what it would cost you to complete your own design. Then, make it simple for you.\n\nHow Much Does The Budget Need To Reach?\n\nAt $200 or more, you'll need 5-10 designs.\n\nA $600 design is just a few lines of code, with more than one of those being finished with a few lines of code.\n\nYou might see a design as \"I'm pretty terrible at reading, so I don't expect to know everything!\" while another has \"No, really, I'm amazing at doing my own design\". But really your design is your best asset.\n\nIn other words, there's no need to complete your own designs if you have so much money.\n\nWhich Is Better: A 2 page spread with a link or two on the bottom for your $500 project? A 3 button \"Click here\" for a $600 project or a 2 page spread with the \"What is the best approach?\" page with the \"What's great about the way your designs will fit in our \"Project Page? \"\n\nThere are so many great answers to every problem on your site that it's probably easier to do a little more research as to how much your design is actually costing compared to the one you will eventually be making.

The game was called Church Grim, and it was produced by David Bockin.\n\nIn the early years he had never been a good man, since he wanted to see a picture of him with a beautiful baby or a lovely wife. He also wanted to see a baby with another baby. But he really thought it was amazing whether an ordinary baby can give birth to the Messiah, and the woman must give up her life, so there was a picture created and the picture was released on the internet.\n\nAt 14 years old, he found out that he had a baby with another baby, so he started to pray for the baby to live and gave it his name. Then he got very unhappy because he didn't want the baby to die. When he finished, he wanted the rest of the people to help him.\n\nThe next day, he gave his name as Church Grim and he is now in the very heart of Florence at Florence Memorial Hospital. When he returns that day as church Grim he plans on going back to Rome, where he thinks it is very interesting he died in a cave with a large pool of blood, then went to the bathroom, had a good breakfast and was completely drunk. I feel very happy at my age.\n\nThe movie Church Grim was written by Iain Karr. It is the most beautiful piece of game art ever created by David Bockin, and it was first presented at the Venice International Film Festival where it was also featured with The Times of London, The Guardian, The Times of London and Other publications.\n\nGod help you, David A.","token_len":415,"entropy":[4.0641,5.7875,2.0279,2.3894,11.1237,14.6265,4.5193,1.429,0.0074,5.9979,0.8999,4.4913,1.6347,6.0335,0.1477,5.8842,2.4328,5.2127,0.3727,5.3842,4.7627,4.3816,5.8633,1.479,1.6299,2.1425,5.4256,0.2014,5.7112,4.149,0.1313,3.0668,0.6429,2.3905,1.5156,2.63,2.2003,2.2571,4.6985,0.1191,1.2826,4.2914,4.6055,3.9104,2.4602,2.8361,3.6922,0.2239,0.6584,0.917,0.1546,0.7694,2.7058,0.1993,0.2453,2.8204,1.5844,0.0003,2.4257,0.0856,1.3425,2.6338,1.9295,1.8291,4.4666,4.9898,4.6192,1.7077,1.5817,2.2559,1.2925,2.9039,0.0002,2.3111,3.6763,1.8552,4.2459,4.3175,6.341,1.9243,6.1572,1.7676,4.3341,3.7951,0.7079,4.5775,0.2222,0.678,2.6416,1.1992,1.0718,1.5084,4.0808,0.1201,1.6733,0.5725,1.207,0.6445,4.4429,0.7213,1.5841,0.1582,0.003,0.0026,1.1175,0.4242,0.0002,3.1327,1.2812,2.9268,2.673,5.0486,2.1001,5.2702,1.9806,1.949,3.864,3.9212,1.36,5.6732,0.3939,4.5443,0.3622,4.2002,2.9579,5.2101,0.1595,3.9837,2.2411,1.3354,4.5611,4.3617,6.2911,1.3293,4.3115,2.0352,0.588,1.8628,3.4451,0.626,0.318,0.8201,1.172,5.5236,2.1516,6.3808,2.8877,0.7581,3.4955,1.2105,5.2345,4.0777,1.9529,0.6593,5.8958,7.0871,4.3252,4.2534,2.4949,4.4632,3.5086,0.6152,0.8913,3.7935,5.2414,1.8949,1.8672,2.9317,5.5371,4.795,2.281,3.986,0.7104,1.9716,3.5876,2.8161,4.6283,0.5188,1.265,4.9748,5.5234,3.3413,2.83,2.461,0.5879,4.8618,2.9472,0.9603,1.473,0.5092,0.5621,0.0002,4.7061,7.2826,0.7131,0.1105,0.8008,1.3967,4.5614,2.1195,0.6858,1.5843,1.2876,1.4966,2.8796,2.1501,2.062,0.898,1.4564,2.6092,0.2396,2.4352,1.5999,3.0368,0.9437,1.5745,1.3861,2.8498,3.9323,2.0125,3.9542,1.3856,2.2339,0.5807,0.672,3.9301,0.7029,3.4709,3.8341,5.587,2.9579,0.6341,2.4232,0.0019,1.4301,1.9696,0.4269,0.1907,1.0038,1.0986,4.0739,0.5156,4.9238,1.8927,0.3434,3.722,1.6809,7.0173,0.0571,0.654,5.015,0.3586,4.0693,0.1866,1.3373,0.8278,0.0002,2.3293,3.2543,0.8249,0.9108,0.8366,3.6883,2.222,1.0765,2.3084,1.5244,0.0392,1.6857,2.0349,5.6223,1.376,2.635,1.5576,4.9306,4.4294,0.044,4.0187,5.509,4.74,5.3222,0.6598,0.4594,5.0378,0.5642,4.5135,6.2488,0.5663,7.0783,4.623,0.36,2.1208,5.524,2.1557,2.6056,2.0115,0.2659,1.6805,2.2719,2.0204,0.2453,6.3019,2.7137,1.1595,3.1482,3.3325,5.9653,7.0241,1.9606,2.0368,5.0283,3.0331,1.3286,4.193,5.0905,0.6446,0.5809,2.6953,5.2449,2.5242,0.9476,1.3452,5.7395,2.1629,4.7612,0.7895,3.9134,4.1695,0.901,3.2188,5.2072,5.0783,0.4681,4.6192,4.7429,1.6189,2.07,4.3882,4.1382,2.8094,0.9823,0.4348,0.0002,2.568,6.0146,1.6023,0.035,1.2538,3.4733,0.5546,5.8454,2.2888,5.2728,5.2017,2.304,1.8034,1.2074,2.9517,3.5532,2.3586,2.8212,0.1261,1.8501,0.0577,1.7064,1.2827,1.8366,1.2565,0.0532,0.0013,0.0015,1.9207,0.9971,1.2094,1.4429,4.5503,4.0272,1.0157,0.4407,2.6041,3.1255,0.2633,0.0402,5.364,0.6879,0.7382,3.5394,3.0234,5.0679,3.9077,5.8746,2.0787,0.5259,2.7085,1.8629,2.566,0.7987,1.3411,2.4329,0.3037,0.3855,1.1424,6.3517,3.601,0.2287,0.3923,0.0002,5.8378,4.3177,1.6196,1.8192,3.2559,5.1865,0.6261]}
{"id":4160,"ended":true,"length":409,"gen_text":"Years after First contact with an alien species, the children from both worlds are being encouraged to write to their counterparts as pen-pals. Years after the initiative was struck, the only message received in our latest delivery begs for our help in defending our allies against a third race invasion. Years after that, the humans begin using their natural abilities to help us to defeat them in other scenarios. Years after that, the children are getting excited about the idea of their time as a part of the humans once again. Years after that, the humans are suddenly ready to fight and learn. Years after that, the children are being taught about how to act together as human and human-like, and the humans finally do some serious damage to us. Years after that, the children become ready to fight and learn, and the humans manage to control the children. Years after that, the human children begin to become one of our primary allies. Years after that, the human children learn the truth about our species' abilities. Years after that, the children become ready to stand against what is and is not what we call ourselves, and to not let our natural abilities weaken us. Years after that, some of the other children begin to think more about the future of their world, and their future needs, and not as some distant past, like last time. Years after that, some of the other children attempt to use their new abilities to aid the aliens in war. Years after that, the children are able to help them defeat the aliens, and their enemies, in a war where the humans are no longer the ones we are today. Years after that, we start to see a more hopeful future. As the others begin to ask these questions, it feels a little less natural and human-like when the children try to make it out, and as time passes, it becomes harder for our children to live up to their promise. This is my hope that we can all have the time we need to grow as a community of dedicated and capable adults. Thank you for your time and consideration.","token_len":416,"entropy":[5.8953,8.951,9.4218,1.1752,4.7099,2.7443,3.4623,0.5272,1.7868,7.3559,6.1408,5.3589,2.521,1.7095,6.3255,6.9902,0.1547,6.6298,4.3044,1.399,7.4241,4.6995,10.6315,3.8447,1.7358,1.9451,1.2039,7.9101,0.2272,2.3117,10.7662,1.3354,7.2082,1.3037,1.273,5.215,6.4129,3.3259,3.9525,5.7503,7.415,9.991,10.4794,1.0512,2.2849,2.1898,1.8404,7.8583,1.2246,7.4899,2.1747,2.3057,5.5623,3.4398,5.0914,0.4893,3.5602,0.1585,4.8265,0.8902,1.3684,5.4394,3.9105,5.8359,1.7165,5.6778,2.0404,0.4083,3.816,2.58,3.852,2.8223,2.5204,3.4671,5.454,6.6016,0.4994,1.0427,0.0802,0.7584,0.1022,1.1403,2.9607,2.543,5.4588,5.3178,0.455,1.5912,2.5117,0.0467,4.0959,6.0839,2.1861,3.2033,4.9973,0.0198,1.4051,4.9455,5.6423,0.4973,1.0772,0.7229,0.0431,0.0397,0.0599,0.7795,2.1189,2.2505,5.396,4.3387,0.1298,2.8898,3.4386,4.5489,2.7427,0.4762,0.036,0.0228,0.064,0.6718,1.1488,1.0996,3.3563,2.3814,2.4814,2.8898,0.3906,5.2567,5.0544,2.3507,3.7609,2.9266,3.3666,1.8792,1.3038,2.6618,1.307,3.1633,3.0668,4.4139,4.833,4.69,1.9343,2.3948,0.9437,4.4475,0.7625,0.8716,0.0271,0.0172,0.0417,0.5558,0.8395,3.3939,4.6882,0.1863,1.771,0.8297,0.1831,1.9625,0.5191,1.3668,0.4829,5.8743,0.0258,5.7703,1.0849,3.3399,2.5531,0.466,0.0247,0.0102,0.034,0.4115,4.0724,1.7499,2.2367,0.5431,3.0029,5.8409,1.0464,1.546,4.7808,1.7043,1.0617,0.4212,0.0171,0.0091,0.0307,0.4326,2.0702,0.1932,2.9428,2.4837,3.8136,0.3421,2.1685,3.8906,1.2987,5.6707,2.5874,0.1539,0.0057,0.0027,0.0055,0.3092,1.3879,1.9966,1.6006,0.0909,4.7797,2.3873,4.8472,2.0969,5.1402,0.9822,0.0219,4.8753,1.1735,3.8363,0.7378,1.7946,0.4732,4.095,5.1081,2.4141,1.8551,4.3188,1.9505,4.7737,0.7413,0.6799,0.3253,0.0063,0.0035,0.0087,6.844,0.5749,0.7671,4.759,0.7963,1.629,0.0975,3.9981,4.0865,1.6047,1.5518,1.9249,1.4983,1.3448,2.7172,1.2035,0.4,3.2007,2.7749,5.5202,1.586,0.3053,5.5345,4.5902,4.1929,4.0725,2.0153,1.7437,4.6184,6.3074,1.1673,0.8494,0.362,0.0115,0.0126,0.0314,1.9269,0.1264,0.1525,0.3217,0.1871,6.606,0.1198,4.6938,0.6101,4.8799,0.9278,0.5406,4.619,1.6391,6.3734,1.2376,4.4905,1.1689,0.1319,0.0057,0.0051,0.0237,0.9468,1.1507,2.0793,3.7703,0.0046,3.9914,2.999,3.3532,0.9253,0.9367,1.5751,0.8047,3.4682,5.24,0.9788,1.6628,2.0439,3.0418,3.5503,1.888,1.4027,1.3994,3.4693,0.202,2.1843,3.4854,3.9991,2.0621,3.2937,0.2676,0.406,0.0059,0.0041,0.008,2.7168,4.3881,0.4247,0.8217,2.683,4.2233,3.019,0.4673,1.9425,5.2507,1.4838,5.974,1.9972,0.0984,5.6913,5.3611,0.0945,0.2892,3.683,4.6114,4.0237,0.457,2.8476,3.7566,2.9957,3.7041,1.7926,0.0478,3.8833,1.8914,1.8127,4.8343,0.1505,3.6063,3.1537,3.0787,4.7276,1.508,4.432,3.5406,0.9815,0.3509,2.3636,0.8549,2.0075,1.707,3.6003,1.9403,0.0977,4.7655,1.2114,0.0088,0.9583,2.9075,0.6555,4.39,0.8986,4.7716,2.171,2.5232,2.0709,0.7877,2.9708,3.573,1.8576,2.7904,1.6536,0.1073,0.3913,3.1165,2.3323,1.1756,2.8309,2.1957,6.0322,2.2265,3.8922,2.5619,1.1757,3.847,0.0382,0.965,1.848,0.9992,1.1878,1.8398,0.2917]}
{"id":3330,"ended":true,"length":396,"gen_text":"A blind man and a blind woman fall in love at first `` sight ''... but one day they find themselves entangled in the eternal battle between man and God.... In this terrible nightmare are the blind and the unseen.\nAn interesting story about time, a love of the past. In the opening scene, the three girls are traveling through time after coming across a ghost - a man and a woman. \u00a0Time goes by very differently. \u00a0In reality, the story happens much more rapidly than the one it gives you. \u00a0In one particular scene the three girls have a very hard time talking at first since they're both children. \u00a0But what they talk about is more about the past. \u00a0The future is always in a constant state of chaos. One of the little creatures ( \u00a0Trey, who goes from being a child to being a man) is still, to an outsider, very young, and has a really long day. \u00a0At some point, time slips away, and Trey loses his father and is forced to become a man. \u00a0The tale ends when the three girls decide to go on a very long journey. On their way they fall through the earth's surface: The ghost is so terrifying, it only makes sense that these five would have to travel through time. On the way, Trey says \"Time is my life.\" \u00a0The ghosts of two days into a lifetime that ends as they find themselves in an ancient stone wall, the ghosts say \"Now is my next date!\",\u00a0 when the four daughters from the old family, who have been left behind, come up on their haunches. So this is a very important story. One that can be read in very short ways in your lifetime. If this story is correct, then we might begin to see how different we all are on this issue of history.\u00a0 I want to be sure that this is not one of these stories that you are going to see, but you know what could be: a good story about love, love of the future.","token_len":416,"entropy":[11.0122,1.551,3.4052,1.1452,2.7368,0.7021,7.0112,1.5187,0.2169,3.347,6.0628,19.514,12.514,5.5886,4.9985,3.6015,4.216,1.5317,1.8265,2.4324,1.1619,4.6024,0.2488,1.7786,5.9012,2.8368,1.0744,3.9286,0.0469,1.5918,4.1078,3.8262,2.0215,6.1344,5.8074,5.3231,1.8636,5.0697,1.9062,0.0979,6.2267,2.7117,3.0172,7.7395,5.2385,3.0478,1.8371,6.2938,2.6089,3.3126,5.1974,2.8012,2.7622,1.4965,2.5545,3.9055,1.4881,5.4085,0.9153,1.164,1.6909,4.4448,4.0806,1.1558,5.4502,1.494,0.5744,5.6644,6.273,1.8119,0.8537,5.1933,5.843,1.6717,2.8633,2.5719,0.2354,0.1356,1.5857,6.1126,0.0821,6.0938,3.7303,1.0315,3.3261,3.1551,2.1363,1.5358,0.0004,2.8224,5.0822,0.194,1.3596,3.8931,5.2462,3.598,1.6892,3.3049,1.3036,1.786,2.7867,5.147,5.9215,1.3016,0.4737,0.6749,0.0007,2.2034,3.6998,4.6038,0.4768,3.1418,2.1646,0.6246,3.1626,1.8043,3.1089,4.2272,0.0265,3.825,3.9763,0.7392,7.0206,0.5814,2.3219,3.0125,5.104,0.8559,0.2638,0.0005,2.0651,4.9898,1.6958,3.0845,0.1076,0.7474,4.3764,3.859,1.5001,0.9138,1.777,0.3306,0.0008,2.0597,4.4399,1.0418,3.7955,2.9109,3.8378,3.7665,0.6093,0.0375,3.9058,0.9037,5.6851,1.1484,0.2866,5.8247,5.7546,4.6773,7.7649,0.0037,5.012,5.2481,2.698,4.1623,5.6579,5.1476,1.0919,0.9287,2.4797,0.2774,1.177,0.4388,1.9356,0.505,1.8719,4.2052,5.733,2.9534,4.4175,2.427,0.1975,3.2045,1.7609,2.0933,1.1583,3.1009,2.047,5.6043,3.7482,4.8225,0.8444,0.5606,0.0006,4.5358,1.9442,0.0325,1.2538,6.0472,5.2332,0.999,1.8886,0.3363,6.6831,4.8139,0.5607,4.5331,1.4991,2.8876,1.829,0.1667,3.2063,0.4638,0.9625,0.5788,0.5553,0.0007,2.6997,5.5707,1.9511,3.8042,1.2662,1.5321,0.705,3.4582,0.3942,1.8248,1.8289,0.3203,5.4417,1.4577,2.0181,2.1947,5.5536,1.6871,0.638,1.935,4.797,4.422,2.5184,4.1245,2.7033,2.4312,6.6448,4.1046,4.3826,2.6035,4.8412,4.517,1.9522,1.5812,5.4617,1.9617,0.4594,0.614,5.3672,4.9957,2.8295,2.4975,0.8416,3.2264,1.2736,0.4032,2.0778,4.8009,1.0818,0.5646,0.8338,3.064,4.8654,3.4119,4.1815,1.1344,4.6586,2.9502,1.8259,1.1913,0.0012,2.3589,2.7243,2.8498,5.3693,5.5957,6.0287,2.4756,2.7558,4.4245,4.1122,5.2612,1.8163,5.0226,0.3349,1.5312,3.2586,3.6204,5.4642,4.6193,1.9112,2.7505,2.5481,3.6611,0.6733,4.9036,2.341,1.9911,4.5239,3.5899,6.3117,5.459,5.8236,1.5974,3.5343,5.4437,5.8362,0.884,4.336,3.8754,3.9532,2.4636,2.1739,1.6173,4.7121,1.2273,0.8525,2.4692,3.1621,4.1707,1.6944,4.7889,0.0062,0.8198,5.5105,4.1742,1.3355,1.4828,2.0388,3.6132,1.1729,1.3059,5.0529,2.2268,4.1088,0.8875,2.1304,1.5382,5.0065,1.4037,5.608,4.6164,3.9499,4.4478,0.404,4.2874,3.7707,1.5817,1.2598,5.3149,0.2715,1.4207,3.0066,3.8504,5.4665,0.3911,1.0324,2.5557,4.7184,3.6465,2.3965,0.7622,4.2297,1.3816,2.9812,1.0748,4.7041,0.5303,3.3945,3.6733,4.0634,0.107,3.5958,2.6569,0.6356,2.0456,1.243,1.2959,3.7595,0.4116,3.8336,1.6286,1.0206,1.8974,2.8072,2.1242,0.0203,2.6349,3.8979,1.1523,3.9159,4.1783,1.1104,6.6894,0.7278,4.5497,2.0288,4.8617,1.371,1.4492,3.0491,1.4779,2.2631,0.9236,0.5301,3.9166,1.1787]}
{"id":2508,"ended":false,"length":413,"gen_text":"Everyone at birth is given a creature that will care for you as you care for it. Today your child was assigned something everyone thought was a mythical creature. You never know if that is the true creature or not. You can sometimes feel like you're in limbo with all the things that have happened since you were a child. It's difficult to describe a child that you might think is nothing but a normal child who was taken without parents before they were born. The children just didn't live up to the expectations they were raised to be. This can give you questions about the world around you or have you just spent your whole childhood trying to make your way to the center and have a better life. Some kids aren't as happy, with a lot of problems, which can lead to long conversations later on. Some people still feel like they need to do away with the things they've done but it's easy to have feelings that make your parents hate you and never allow them to go on, so there's always a problem with your parents. Just making up things can be very difficult so stay with your dreams. I'd like to know what you'd do if your child came to you and asked, \"If you could have a child from your life you might be able to use them for your own?\" What would happen, if they gave you so much energy, and now your children will love you for what you do? What would the relationship look like if you could have children who would love you for your life and care for you instead. The answer is clear, and I hope that answers will emerge someday. But for now, just tell me about what inspires you to try to make it happen, and I'd love to see what other people have to say about this. I want to know more information about people who try to make it happen. Your opinions I am glad that my friend is starting to share her experiences. I will be writing about her on her blog as well. I hope you like it.\nPosted by Kym K. at 8:10 AM","token_len":417,"entropy":[4.9845,9.9867,4.454,5.6522,1.4135,9.8571,2.021,3.5493,7.7573,0.6337,3.1695,3.379,2.301,5.2856,0.1014,4.7178,0.6646,7.563,5.0276,3.4362,4.3993,6.2562,5.4236,9.5623,4.2354,1.0159,1.9179,8.2368,0.5489,1.1491,2.9297,4.9336,1.9106,3.1953,2.3093,2.6655,2.0188,2.6717,1.6032,1.2172,0.7902,0.4784,2.6684,2.792,5.6276,2.447,2.5153,0.9714,2.1977,2.5398,5.8067,3.5841,3.5194,1.4411,2.6149,0.9958,2.553,0.8215,2.5253,0.946,0.4127,1.325,0.6286,0.6083,2.5715,0.918,4.1553,0.43,4.7182,4.7065,2.3666,2.0769,1.6367,4.8302,3.1815,0.6967,4.7773,1.099,0.6049,4.9698,1.4964,3.1867,3.2224,3.9925,6.7094,5.2571,5.7093,1.2608,1.0702,0.5604,0.296,3.2131,5.1571,5.7374,3.8719,0.001,3.7797,0.7547,0.0005,1.2827,0.1946,2.4785,1.2963,3.865,0.3713,1.7328,0.5839,3.8978,3.9016,5.0485,0.7755,5.8481,1.1237,2.3408,2.0451,1.2894,0.0231,3.2675,4.8851,1.0066,3.3058,4.9721,1.9401,1.3751,2.4507,2.663,0.0406,3.3507,3.2377,2.8502,1.59,1.248,3.9882,3.5374,4.1074,2.6993,3.3225,0.6123,0.6347,4.3504,3.2438,5.4704,0.0007,2.1889,2.0562,3.4279,5.6501,2.6029,1.7976,0.2075,2.9487,2.017,5.2132,1.2433,2.3129,0.1694,5.4952,6.026,6.6925,1.0644,0.5533,2.6612,2.712,5.3389,2.3728,1.4125,0.3704,3.6698,0.7064,3.6057,6.747,0.0013,2.066,2.6772,1.1629,2.6297,1.4678,4.6346,2.9491,0.9123,4.291,0.189,4.3366,4.1111,1.7842,3.6609,4.5445,5.1964,4.7295,0.1705,2.0686,4.7195,5.0089,1.3415,0.1519,3.2148,2.1983,5.1444,3.3579,3.4633,1.0373,2.3436,1.593,4.9161,2.0748,2.7896,3.1025,0.7864,6.003,6.1064,3.437,2.7548,2.7647,1.4336,3.2203,1.6055,4.5946,5.6913,2.1871,1.1773,5.0823,1.1572,4.0999,4.6261,1.3981,0.0691,3.9095,1.3367,1.5833,4.0018,1.5314,0.6469,2.0533,1.7046,3.4178,1.6489,0.2652,1.1454,1.9254,3.0441,0.1591,4.6181,0.86,1.6758,3.2654,1.6356,2.5635,4.2009,2.9666,3.0235,4.4393,4.6367,1.7252,1.0059,0.0032,5.7707,2.1288,1.6181,2.267,0.8832,3.0398,3.8029,0.5762,4.2434,4.023,1.6749,2.4015,4.424,0.3132,6.0883,0.3737,3.7208,2.2144,2.6788,5.3182,3.224,3.2871,4.9472,3.4317,0.1192,2.1091,3.1663,0.1761,2.0306,0.6033,1.7046,0.4644,4.2358,4.6963,1.9252,0.0004,1.2158,0.9863,2.1971,1.5801,2.0607,2.5061,1.7153,1.3607,0.1445,1.2,3.3833,3.7289,1.8021,3.8917,0.1778,0.3002,5.8391,5.2918,3.9014,3.1341,0.9192,5.4702,2.2313,2.4285,1.8044,1.8809,1.9572,4.4008,3.052,5.8769,4.2745,0.4205,5.1015,2.9458,0.0467,0.5496,3.2445,5.0545,0.7098,2.8892,2.5453,7.2415,0.1306,1.2043,3.7138,1.1966,1.9444,2.4839,2.1111,2.6129,0.7557,1.4362,1.8252,0.454,0.0344,3.2123,1.0538,3.1696,0.887,1.5459,0.4469,0.3101,0.7265,3.1207,0.9578,2.1213,3.1316,0.1995,1.9236,3.8046,6.8212,0.5746,4.7716,0.5508,4.5705,0.1998,1.008,1.29,0.1111,0.9535,5.6182,5.7601,6.9349,3.8444,4.1896,2.2754,3.6734,3.7642,3.0262,4.6165,0.725,2.4839,1.2959,1.8921,1.6966,1.4701,4.4162,2.2418,3.5614,2.1736,1.762,3.4001,1.6588,0.5401,2.4657,0.6568,0.7638,1.729,2.206,1.0329,2.9979,1.9193,1.0003,2.128,1.3939,0.0459,5.0612,4.6833,3.8318,2.649,0.4348,2.4472,0.0089,4.1777,0.6179]}

You are a convict being held in a thought prison, which removes all of your senses and paralyzes you, only allowing you to think. However, you begin hearing a strange voice calling your name from within your own mind... your father. The sound is so strange that it makes you feel that he lives inside you because he cannot see outside his own mind. I knew that the way to stop that thought prison was by a hypnotic procedure but I quickly switched sides. After that, we saw that man on his own and when the man saw his own vision, he began to think of killing us. Then he knew that he has no powers or was created by him. The man was killed so that he would have to die a simple death. How would I have thought?\u00a0He told me about a time when the evil of the evil man is gone now by the time God was still around...\nA good word to people who have thought about this but have not learned its meaning:\u00a0 \"It looks like it came about after what we had been through, and there's a problem with the mind. Just like the things you said are just like the things in the world, the mind is telling you things which you can feel. You can have a good impression of the world.

{"id":4031,"ended":false,"length":389,"gen_text":"Every once in awhile the deepest, most sincere thoughts that a person has are being displayed in a pop-up message above their head.\n\nHowever, that is exactly what happened in the first place. The words, images and photos of women posted on websites are also being displayed in the background, and that's really what it meant to be a victim.\n\nEven though the original poster was taken down, the group now shows up at the front of the gallery, and the site is showing them all over. This is just another way to prove the victims weren't taken down. The Facebook group will feature all of the images posted by members, but one thing I would like to remind you is that our goal is not to harass or offend anyone online or anywhere else. This is what a feminist group is all about: the community giving back to the person with the most impact.\n\nHere's hoping your community is proud and proud of what we're doing, and there's so much more we can do to make making this community better for everyone.\n\nI thank all of you for your support. We're really excited to give out this new poster and to promote our brand and create an atmosphere for women that is just as healthy for our community as the ones we serve.\n\nI'd also like to thank all of you for being there today, and for being able to be with us in the moment. As we begin to make those decisions on where the blog should go in this world, we're going to be sharing our thoughts on what that might look like, and what we will do to avoid it.

{"id":2550,"ended":false,"length":415,"gen_text":"You cry after sex. The girl you've been sleeping with has been systematically collecting your tears after you've had sex, into carefully labelled and categorized vials. Why is she collecting them? What is she going to do with them? Why would i want to do something about that? How much money will i lose if she stops collecting tears and doesn't have any money? Her children will be 'wounded'. How much money will her children lose once they die? Her children will be buried. Is her's body safe inside the morgue? How will she know that what he has done is wrong? How will she know that he is lying? All these are factors we need to control so that all people who suffer abuse and sexual abuse have a better option but for those who are abused. If children are forced into sex, they are not going to love it. If they are told that their parents care for them, they will love them like any little kid and they will hate it but when your parents don't help you, what will they think of you and not you? And we need to stop treating those children like objects of the sex industry. We need to stop making the difference in any way we can. A woman's tears should not be ignored, not matter what her body does or what your beliefs are. That is wrong. A woman's tears should not be ignored, not matter which position (tactical position) your body will play in. This is why we need to stop doing this and treat the victims equally. We need to take responsibility for how we treat anyone who has been involved with sex. As long as you stop trying to convince anyone that you care about them, and take responsibility for their wellbeing, you will not get abused, and you can stop taking it for granted you are still in love and this is how we know there is hope when we accept all their emotional needs. Your support of people who are victims is critical, just like helping them. It will be hard for them to recover if they are forced over to the sex industry.\n\nAdvertisements","token_len":422,"entropy":[10.1188,6.4849,7.4964,1.4504,4.1253,4.9951,2.8117,2.7488,1.2561,4.1438,0.0101,2.5614,2.5044,9.4272,8.8837,2.4147,6.8318,6.5078,1.7712,0.5314,2.0365,0.2574,2.4727,8.6846,7.8432,5.8753,4.0837,6.2691,5.8091,0.498,1.0827,5.2277,2.4953,2.8659,2.6556,2.0202,0.6069,3.2629,1.9126,1.8718,3.7436,0.0729,0.2432,0.879,0.4514,0.4438,2.712,3.2524,9.8728,1.7017,0.3252,3.1524,2.9351,1.8015,3.3516,0.5189,4.0252,3.5638,2.9264,1.8787,2.0843,2.9615,1.7948,1.9752,4.0569,0.2878,2.2278,2.3784,4.4663,0.0005,3.3117,1.9861,1.0652,2.5552,5.5045,5.3149,1.366,1.2935,7.4665,4.8265,1.9732,2.2276,2.9064,1.7014,0.711,0.1803,3.8847,1.773,0.7494,7.0516,1.6741,3.3726,0.3701,4.09,1.4557,0.3177,0.6954,5.3346,1.9029,4.1238,2.9397,9.7311,3.5815,2.5201,5.8948,1.6166,4.1416,0.0049,0.6892,3.1352,1.9423,0.7766,2.2742,2.2791,5.4662,6.1293,2.13,0.4489,0.8648,1.1281,0.4528,2.1367,0.7168,0.448,0.1852,0.3101,1.6375,1.6751,4.7034,0.9937,4.6274,2.518,2.8748,5.691,4.5811,1.7944,0.024,5.3836,5.0708,0.6528,4.4495,3.5657,2.9094,3.7949,3.4379,1.9791,3.5687,0.6917,3.6199,1.559,3.7123,5.0032,5.7927,4.8952,2.3152,0.4548,1.5747,2.8887,6.1055,3.6061,6.1572,1.0731,4.3502,1.5577,1.6932,1.3849,1.8938,1.6334,2.1445,2.5097,0.0088,6.1909,0.8289,0.6677,1.7485,0.9206,0.5091,3.9986,0.9968,2.2135,2.4588,6.3492,1.5994,0.0717,0.8862,0.4651,0.9265,3.2105,1.0408,5.9117,3.4747,5.914,3.4014,2.9424,1.9985,0.1706,5.092,1.0892,4.9589,4.1362,4.753,1.7935,3.8762,0.0008,4.6724,1.006,0.9763,4.2282,1.8486,2.038,4.2655,1.2808,0.1293,2.5735,5.6754,1.3664,0.1596,4.1941,4.8721,1.3438,0.3321,2.2119,3.9557,3.5716,1.8747,1.3593,4.3869,2.7474,4.8161,2.0118,0.3518,0.8172,2.109,0.3073,0.1064,0.7086,3.87,3.0979,5.1423,2.7443,5.0238,0.5811,1.9163,0.1617,1.2328,4.9303,3.5236,2.4471,4.4565,2.7233,1.0694,0.3233,5.167,2.0794,3.4744,5.1871,1.6348,2.0007,2.2353,2.5019,1.5496,2.3437,4.8818,5.8807,1.2433,0.4667,4.6247,1.1209,5.2852,0.6943,2.9283,0.4253,0.5501,0.4307,0.3739,0.5405,0.1505,1.0519,0.9375,0.0765,0.0218,7.074,4.4802,6.8556,5.6583,3.4651,1.1569,1.5076,0.5537,2.7574,1.0396,3.7288,2.2115,0.5499,2.2786,4.2538,0.4991,2.6231,1.458,0.536,0.4239,1.3757,4.6231,2.3698,2.2925,5.7791,2.5046,3.0307,5.4585,0.3742,2.0382,0.4471,0.0531,4.0886,2.6108,0.3165,3.4398,0.7518,0.124,6.2247,1.0714,1.911,0.9988,5.6333,1.7094,1.5768,1.367,4.8749,2.3358,0.004,1.9241,5.7239,4.3275,0.0225,4.8589,3.2951,1.1541,1.3337,2.1436,0.4739,0.966,0.679,3.2212,4.2559,0.7242,0.0706,1.8385,3.0736,0.4177,1.1477,0.443,2.5022,3.1694,4.3491,2.6099,2.3097,1.089,4.2686,4.1124,4.3069,3.5215,1.8007,0.0279,6.2183,2.0936,3.8832,3.503,2.0227,2.9693,5.4163,0.7279,3.2961,1.7549,4.98,5.0542,0.5282,2.7869,4.3863,0.9376,5.1981,3.8444,5.561,5.0705,1.4053,0.8307,4.8187,4.1177,3.7013,4.1311,0.6786,1.5659,3.2803,2.7488,3.9702,2.5765,5.4749,1.1434,4.6526,3.1405,2.8478,2.7951,2.8308,2.8656,3.852,1.3027,1.5704,0.2244,4.5934,2.3048,1.1752,1.3754,2.7964,8.4969,1.1279,1.0111,0.4583,0.0655,0.9764,3.4447,0.2091,3.9442]}

One way is to help their immune system to keep them safe, and that means taking the risks to stop the diseases that you will eliminate.","token_len":425,"entropy":[6.1405,8.0496,2.0994,4.9348,5.1897,12.2923,3.9741,0.8791,3.1684,0.8257,5.0937,2.3052,0.6018,0.4462,6.6632,0.0051,6.4301,4.5377,1.4347,9.5786,0.1398,0.8966,4.9751,2.7557,6.5521,3.8584,5.0387,1.9148,7.9153,6.059,8.4245,2.698,8.6556,3.7081,2.8627,2.9827,8.6309,2.088,7.0217,2.6862,7.4079,2.7279,9.3052,0.6091,2.2753,1.8054,2.2141,0.0808,6.688,4.9249,0.1984,0.2016,0.98,1.4264,5.7119,4.9663,4.8173,0.4747,3.0406,7.6949,1.4343,8.4882,0.4357,1.862,1.8607,0.033,4.4038,3.6568,5.129,2.7012,3.1298,0.8082,4.5539,4.983,1.9627,3.2227,1.5662,4.9971,0.9702,2.8109,0.0116,0.7753,3.3894,0.1182,0.8042,3.9133,3.6671,0.2062,1.6487,2.7403,1.4801,3.6637,3.0755,4.396,1.0579,0.7489,5.3381,0.2316,1.1071,0.0003,3.8303,4.9451,3.1155,2.2061,6.367,0.4922,2.8514,5.7581,1.1432,4.3141,1.2682,3.6279,0.964,3.7798,3.7085,1.7533,7.7472,1.0579,4.366,4.7002,4.381,0.6369,4.9939,2.0514,4.351,1.9547,1.6914,1.4422,1.8453,0.3547,2.8672,4.9896,1.1419,4.1634,2.0182,4.6723,1.9189,1.4986,0.7494,2.9789,3.8929,1.9124,2.6131,4.5659,1.3648,0.5266,2.4089,0.3136,3.0913,2.9526,5.1706,4.4607,1.6659,5.5933,1.0483,1.2882,0.7193,4.4193,0.0003,5.2119,5.11,3.7962,2.7099,3.8102,4.6663,4.6323,2.2955,3.4181,4.9003,3.8457,3.6872,0.7797,4.0436,1.8494,3.3734,0.002,0.0422,0.2105,3.171,2.0407,4.5026,2.4263,3.1333,1.9391,2.0232,2.5068,0.3268,2.5312,7.1412,1.0886,0.4248,2.9463,4.3578,4.3724,3.3819,1.9993,2.2005,4.4692,4.3433,0.0342,1.6255,0.9065,2.3437,1.9706,0.6507,2.4032,2.0905,4.4609,0.0778,0.6547,4.1981,3.3217,0.1152,5.3523,1.0966,3.5374,6.5092,0.4833,0.4573,5.7437,0.4233,1.8345,5.0726,0.2865,5.4272,3.6485,1.2535,2.3956,1.4096,1.1288,3.9961,4.8299,0.0012,2.3071,3.0335,0.7193,6.7185,0.0047,0.4583,1.399,4.4778,1.4367,4.0573,0.0866,1.9183,4.4478,0.8493,4.8098,3.4446,0.8823,0.8083,4.7057,2.3906,1.288,4.1133,2.111,3.4499,1.6034,1.1412,3.5132,1.6874,3.5379,4.4905,4.1863,0.0165,0.784,6.3922,6.0592,2.5373,4.9792,3.9288,2.9116,1.4297,0.2237,2.0142,5.2235,0.5582,0.7526,0.2433,3.9525,5.8676,2.2446,1.8979,2.461,0.0064,3.8552,4.285,2.6636,2.5304,3.619,4.7976,3.2114,1.8756,3.0207,2.811,3.3097,1.5546,5.7093,2.4988,3.9398,2.0082,0.7583,2.69,6.6766,2.581,4.1047,5.4793,2.3994,7.6848,3.716,2.2699,0.0777,1.4302,1.1863,4.0113,1.2516,4.7399,2.0768,0.0141,0.0052,1.2754,4.4018,2.5103,3.9602,3.529,4.8611,1.5493,5.4844,3.6602,4.2594,5.4929,0.0514,0.3224,0.8624,4.3044,1.1141,0.7531,2.0099,4.1557,4.9632,0.0327,4.5909,2.0853,3.8843,0.5204,1.0787,0.0004,4.2952,0.6311,1.778,2.3444,2.3193,1.7025,0.2379,1.561,2.6574,1.6887,6.512,1.0409,5.5689,3.6587,2.2664,1.9195,2.7771,3.1434,2.6543,1.7818,2.2436,0.9475,2.6564,2.4149,1.3776,0.3729,1.3528,3.7054,2.701,5.8557,1.3915,3.2558,3.8872,0.4556,3.2745,0.3711,3.7646,3.807,3.1813,5.4601,4.8962,0.4759,1.4015,4.3291,0.0822,1.1475,5.3981,1.4118,1.2594,5.0482,1.5996,0.9998,0.6651,2.9887,5.0893,2.1608,0.0784,1.7994,4.1474,1.0028,2.86,2.2787,1.6688,2.7961,1.7734,3.4475,2.5554,4.5298,2.6471,3.3883,0.4957,4.3806,1.5009,2.0344,4.4054,4.7644,0.6969]}

{"id":3367,"ended":false,"length":382,"gen_text":"An aging supervillian dons their gear for one last heist... and one that only the true heroes of the Marvel Comics Universe can stop them from doing.\n\nWith all due respect, I never thought it'd actually happen to Rokugan. With everything he's done since he left Marvel, he has been able to finally confront his past and reclaim the light.\n\nIt is a moment that he has struggled with for years and years, and has finally found the courage to acknowledge that being a member of the Avengers has changed his character. Rokugan has finally learned how to appreciate heroism, and to accept it with a simple smile.\n\nFor any fan reading this post, know that Rokugan can be a real joy to watch. Many members of the Avengers (including himself) will find themselves feeling some sort of light weight after what will inevitably be his final year at the organization. This has taken a toll on their lives.\n\nAt Rokugan's final year, he is still being physically and psychologically abused on the job as some sort of surrogate father figure for his children. He is often neglected and not cared for. On occasion, they might even die. When he finally gets to the point where he decides to start taking on these kids as his own, Rokugan gives them an amazing life. That's what we are seeing the same way over and over again.\n\nI've always loved this character.

{"id":1562,"ended":true,"length":401,"gen_text":"Humans are widely regarded as the most beautiful species in the galaxy. We don't know this. But we do know that in the year 2210, the solar system is about to collide with another sun with a diameter of 13 kilometers, and we will discover that the Earth's atmosphere is not a part of the cosmic mass sink.\n\n\"With this cosmic catastrophe [that] will not be stopped until the planet is made fully habitable and the gas is cooled enough to accept human settlement on it, we expect the Earth to become uninhabitable for some time with the amount of heat generated by every solar eruption and the amount of space between objects that has since been completely frozen with solar flare pressure.\"\n\nAccording to one of the last post written by a scientist on the topic, a report posted in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, an article appearing in Science, indicates the planet is no longer habitable after about 3.4 billion years of existence. The report also states that after about 3 billion years, the atmosphere of Earth will begin to become more carbonic and with this carbonate formation of the atmosphere, not to mention a decrease in life cycle length.\n\nWe do not have to wait 4.4 billion years for the planet to become uninhabitable: The planet will already be in the habitable zone of the solar system, and will be habitable by around 20,000 years and at the rate we're talking now. The researchers say that by this time, if there is no major solar flares, Earth's atmospheric greenhouse gases will be much like those from a burning coal-fired furnace.\n\nThis study comes after years of speculation about the planet taking a hit from catastrophic events and their effect on the planet's future trajectory at the beginning of the 21st Century. Scientists have long warned of the need to keep the planet around habitable before the year 2100. At this point, scientists believe there is enough evidence to rule out the possibility of life on Earth. Until now, none of these ideas was given mainstream support, but this new paper could bring some peace to the controversy over the issue of the future.","token_len":427,"entropy":[7.039,1.7652,7.7897,2.2056,0.1652,1.2002,1.3637,5.1119,2.2609,1.8087,0.2213,2.8538,0.9553,3.8713,4.5181,0.0007,1.4457,5.8169,2.9177,1.9235,1.7558,0.7802,0.1017,0.3232,4.3187,1.409,5.4869,5.2044,3.3334,0.3239,1.6108,4.4681,0.1046,1.7001,3.35,0.8959,2.844,0.16,2.0251,3.9738,4.4283,1.0068,3.0963,0.2524,5.1075,4.5133,2.2616,1.8244,2.8802,2.9147,5.0201,1.4301,1.4509,3.8155,2.3483,2.2509,0.6838,3.7701,3.5673,5.3714,0.0042,0.9506,3.4647,5.8974,4.9403,0.5252,1.155,0.002,4.5895,5.1238,2.0885,4.3819,4.3781,6.8071,3.1946,2.2096,1.5854,4.5038,1.154,4.2395,2.3356,1.5126,4.0196,1.1611,5.1033,3.9325,0.8179,3.0196,2.3012,5.2988,2.4293,3.5849,3.0461,0.3772,5.0973,4.8055,3.2367,2.7258,1.76,0.3836,1.3214,4.7191,2.3975,2.2424,0.5929,1.9879,2.9229,0.0,0.004,1.1794,3.9066,0.1785,6.1707,1.5515,4.8227,0.021,4.2223,2.2908,0.7029,5.5921,2.819,4.6058,2.9609,1.6383,1.6794,0.0165,5.1133,4.2889,6.9058,2.3646,3.9906,6.4757,0.7244,5.0315,3.5077,5.872,5.5251,4.6096,6.6463,1.9776,0.3448,0.0004,4.6662,0.0089,5.225,1.8017,0.3764,5.9156,5.8236,5.4098,0.5149,3.6214,2.669,2.1268,0.8549,1.9727,0.6532,3.7296,5.0201,5.6448,3.3042,0.9105,4.1335,0.0245,0.0289,0.0101,1.4147,1.4364,4.5697,1.9545,6.0399,0.7021,3.0256,1.8576,4.3671,2.5413,2.6589,1.8152,4.7936,0.139,0.7834,3.5676,4.2148,3.8162,0.7287,2.6678,0.1164,0.0132,2.1129,3.1587,0.3695,2.2725,2.2747,3.0338,1.7833,0.5307,5.2452,2.8049,2.0832,1.9986,0.0212,0.7671,0.7274,2.7839,1.3678,2.2557,0.9758,2.9332,0.0996,3.0619,2.6773,4.7745,1.9929,1.386,5.3142,3.9241,2.9811,1.8901,5.3035,3.877,0.5226,0.5997,0.6554,6.4328,2.6985,0.0159,3.3735,3.4703,0.0689,4.6573,4.9708,5.7366,1.139,0.5045,0.0002,4.9887,4.0643,1.3083,3.1593,2.4159,0.8196,5.3742,1.4699,0.7075,0.0436,0.0272,1.1052,1.2862,1.7964,0.1254,1.2355,0.9869,0.0001,0.0016,5.5849,2.895,2.2691,1.1227,4.9818,0.7918,2.2932,1.4391,1.2185,0.0578,2.1023,0.5992,1.629,0.0192,1.9961,1.7247,3.3283,1.5978,3.896,2.1161,3.4127,2.9477,2.3498,0.0436,0.0824,4.456,4.584,2.5522,3.0836,4.0392,3.9742,2.3688,1.7743,1.0211,2.614,4.0061,2.4558,0.9924,3.2899,2.7376,0.3724,0.7567,3.95,2.661,0.8574,1.9515,4.5022,2.3862,3.9029,0.9153,3.1692,1.8782,4.8416,4.6917,1.4953,0.4832,1.0949,3.4494,6.4991,1.7402,2.6905,2.4563,4.4498,2.4633,2.4006,0.4752,6.608,0.7595,0.5993,0.0003,3.4874,3.916,4.0043,2.7378,3.166,0.0277,2.4705,1.3678,0.7578,3.6269,7.2162,1.8076,3.0407,1.4471,6.1789,1.4869,2.9986,4.7643,3.6601,0.0435,0.7959,2.0292,1.1085,4.4387,6.03,6.5178,1.0144,4.2109,0.0517,0.5467,1.2674,0.0008,2.3769,0.2124,3.1973,1.1015,2.3756,3.8694,2.1301,0.8964,4.3759,1.0234,3.3096,1.2999,0.6369,4.926,4.7788,4.6856,1.8789,4.7248,2.4176,1.2165,5.2963,1.8271,0.3238,0.292,2.8641,1.8199,2.7945,0.7843,4.0053,1.6683,0.6639,3.8919,0.1128,1.4515,0.2219,0.6972,3.0348,1.3887,0.8381,0.9832,6.6733,1.7434,0.2032,5.4688,0.0935,1.7161,4.0406,3.5979,5.1231,6.0278,2.5309,2.3513,1.7508,2.9005,1.694,3.2197,4.5476,4.6676,2.4766,5.3594,0.5945,0.9461,5.7285,3.0787,0.703,4.9272,2.7107,1.4746,2.6762,2.951]}
{"id":1694,"ended":false,"length":394,"gen_text":"10 years ago, scientists discovered that there is something after death. And it's bad, really really bad.\n\nIn fact, in the year 2000, scientists discovered that the age of death for certain organs of animals is up from 13.5 to 15.5, suggesting that humans have probably not fully evolved the mechanisms required to keep us alive.\n\nIn addition, some researchers believe that we live through the end.\n\nIt is a very good story for us, so I guess if we could just save the world for another 100 years, we would be pretty sure that all of us were right.\n\nBut wait, there's more. There are some who believe that humans have the ability to break free from their long-simmering habits.\n\nHere's the big one. You probably won't like this little piece because I can tell you that it's from a book and is titled 'The Power Of Choice, and Love, and Self-control'.\n\nIf you're reading this, you've seen my article on the subject. I know you've heard of it too. You should definitely try it, because I won't tell you how to do it.\n\nNow, I know where this might lead. I'm sure this isn't something that's right for people to get into, either... So what if you just read it without any real thought at all.\n\nWell, there you go. It makes perfect sense because if we can live as effectively without the thought of that life we enjoy, it will come out better than we've ever known.\n\nIt means you get to have a life full of amazing things, and you're so happy when somebody told you how amazing they were.\n\nThere's lots of reasons to be happy, I guarantee. But if we do, then we might even live a long, happy life.\n\nSo maybe you will. I can tell you that after all it's just so depressing, when you are given that chance, when you know we could be so lucky.\n\nAnd, what do you think?","token_len":428,"entropy":[7.234,2.1433,1.8507,7.9931,2.989,0.8549,4.6282,1.1232,4.177,9.7644,4.2005,4.3153,4.0085,2.0394,1.0675,7.007,2.9949,4.2219,7.7156,0.0189,0.3594,1.089,0.0012,3.6155,2.4911,0.0439,3.8131,1.5944,5.3722,1.7067,0.2218,2.8939,1.4426,0.612,1.8858,5.8581,0.1931,1.6959,1.8965,4.3891,4.566,3.3245,4.7558,1.5855,5.2118,3.614,5.0518,0.7922,1.0765,0.3469,2.386,0.3176,0.7724,2.3513,4.4932,0.3325,3.7384,2.0186,5.2855,4.4921,4.7424,2.3777,2.3374,4.1434,4.1248,0.4975,4.0339,1.8064,0.1762,0.7928,0.7978,0.0002,3.1287,3.6839,0.4371,3.4735,3.2031,1.4988,0.3533,2.9961,4.2799,4.686,1.7691,2.0217,5.045,1.888,0.0002,4.319,2.7237,3.3123,3.3428,3.3149,3.6996,3.5184,1.8569,1.485,4.4728,1.9127,4.3503,3.8521,1.2406,3.4142,2.4007,5.2276,1.3958,1.3931,3.6495,2.8613,3.1448,1.2817,0.5547,1.4855,1.7369,1.2377,3.6351,3.492,1.2471,4.23,1.1881,1.1193,3.5277,5.714,1.0093,0.5024,0.0002,2.766,4.5961,0.726,0.8403,0.128,0.0504,0.6,3.8145,1.6832,3.1696,4.6053,1.429,0.418,2.3433,1.5266,4.3698,1.9406,0.0378,5.2211,1.6599,0.7935,2.7163,4.9147,0.7929,5.2224,0.5868,0.0029,5.6947,1.1628,0.5866,0.0001,4.3889,0.3773,2.0238,4.4574,1.243,0.9845,4.1924,4.6923,3.3306,0.0004,4.0758,1.9827,5.6382,3.0497,3.9519,1.8494,3.9698,3.1989,0.0736,0.9634,1.7378,0.6933,4.8966,1.0986,4.5495,5.6677,4.1357,4.7999,4.2117,1.3863,4.5264,3.2984,5.836,3.8932,3.8833,5.9087,2.0115,0.2882,4.801,0.4319,3.9686,1.7002,0.6123,0.0002,3.7087,0.2692,1.508,2.6328,0.306,0.7095,0.9973,2.5206,3.3335,2.9399,3.508,1.5794,1.346,2.8958,1.4319,2.4062,4.3425,2.1151,1.5779,2.0026,2.1891,1.3371,3.8091,0.7421,3.9949,3.7903,4.2268,3.7419,0.4439,2.9402,0.7313,1.7708,4.8851,0.0065,2.8055,0.0382,1.6093,0.7388,1.4684,0.1889,0.5825,0.3964,0.0002,4.088,0.6903,1.7265,1.6643,6.0603,1.5811,4.565,0.7931,1.5992,1.802,1.8343,2.4491,4.104,3.3586,0.0002,3.3762,1.144,2.4186,5.2945,0.2647,4.7276,2.9616,4.0504,1.6382,1.3937,4.443,6.9296,6.3427,3.2503,2.7802,1.3774,3.7977,3.1751,1.6217,6.2409,2.5245,3.2457,1.7527,3.5501,0.0033,3.4637,0.9111,0.0002,1.8801,0.1628,3.5449,2.1227,0.6538,0.3784,3.0098,4.9419,2.4337,0.0018,4.2617,2.7448,2.2892,2.1395,3.9409,5.132,6.1341,4.6974,2.6119,4.2989,0.5768,5.4756,3.8678,3.0492,5.1556,0.9516,3.0878,2.3787,5.2849,3.1869,2.5115,2.1044,2.132,2.4548,0.2599,2.9021,1.0345,0.2434,0.0003,3.3878,4.4127,2.6036,3.5798,0.9508,3.0512,1.2123,2.7365,3.576,0.0035,4.8266,1.604,1.3475,1.4453,1.7868,2.2671,5.3082,1.7874,3.1849,7.6343,5.8884,0.0062,3.3454,3.4714,1.7416,0.531,0.6889,0.4012,0.0002,4.627,0.7671,4.2068,0.2003,3.3758,1.327,1.8093,0.5638,1.0693,3.959,5.4598,0.9289,2.1139,2.2215,1.9781,4.1549,4.1494,2.2671,1.1207,4.3848,3.3319,3.0157,1.9973,2.9244,0.9044,0.8497,0.5941,0.5648,0.3192,0.0002,2.4972,4.7575,1.711,4.381,2.307,2.7784,3.3473,1.3264,0.02,1.2083,5.5459,2.0319,4.0259,0.5141,2.7182,3.8986,4.6303,2.2771,4.6432,0.7356,3.9755,5.4145,3.1522,2.5515,2.0613,3.4342,0.3055,4.1183,5.7341,4.2621,2.1491,2.4726,2.1492,1.49,0.2748,0.0002,2.327,3.7513,5.1864,2.7527,0.2117,0.5375,0.4003]}

{"id":3943,"ended":false,"length":420,"gen_text":"My mom gave me a piece of paper and an essay question in a dream last night, and I thought I would share it with you guys. What would it be like in a hurricane from a baby dragon's point of view?\n\nMy mom was in the kitchen when she went on a family vacation to Mexico for Thanksgiving. She was in the second row of the car when she saw a car that was going straight ahead and she suddenly felt like she had never seen anything like that before! This had been before she heard anything like this during a movie. She ran on the car, she came out of the bushes and she ran into a guy who was actually wearing a green jacket. This guy pulled her skirt down, he threw her in the bushes, and I thought for a minute she had hit a bump with this guy, and that's when we all knew we were going to hit the bump!\n\nIt was very cool to really love her when she realized what my mom can do when she goes from being a kid to someone who will go out, and there's so much joy and feeling like she'll have a real relationship with the outside world. She's a very, very special person.\n\nMy mom can feel so much of something new. She can feel what's happening in her life when she becomes very, very good at being where she is through her everyday life, her mom lives the life of a little girl now.\n\nI do think what she really misses most is the love that God has bestowed upon her every single day. God always gives life to people so that if anything that's good that is good for you that's good for the world and for yourself. That's my mom's heart. If we don't get that, then I can't go on with this blog, so I'll tell you I love my mom at my own risk, so all you'll have to do is read that and then if you do, then enjoy the memories that you will be sharing with your friends for the rest of your life!\n\nThanks so much, Mike and John, and happy holidays!","token_len":430,"entropy":[8.7232,4.984,0.4995,1.0475,4.9493,0.0269,0.7795,1.5059,5.5109,5.4304,7.2602,3.8767,2.9398,8.3023,6.6118,0.9552,1.9514,0.7144,0.8564,3.0921,2.3932,2.1714,4.0133,0.586,0.4714,0.5602,3.7856,0.5162,4.9165,3.2866,2.2477,0.4876,0.1668,4.4402,1.7676,9.3864,6.6393,2.8948,7.1503,8.4611,3.2035,4.736,0.0222,0.0003,0.3265,0.9293,0.0036,3.7772,0.6293,2.8068,2.8556,1.322,3.8365,2.319,2.3586,3.5401,4.1253,1.3541,4.9309,1.0072,3.383,3.9198,3.1705,4.0684,0.7839,1.3947,1.4878,2.5185,0.977,6.0792,1.3467,0.9,0.6245,2.4863,2.5088,0.9087,1.5387,0.9904,3.6389,2.4346,0.9525,2.1292,3.9946,3.2899,1.8827,2.5465,5.728,1.6651,1.4933,0.8419,2.0159,4.3856,0.8337,0.9681,0.329,2.6371,0.2395,3.7959,4.1042,5.582,1.9662,4.3924,2.4058,4.6695,3.655,1.173,0.7451,6.0315,1.4635,4.3213,1.5882,1.5432,4.1278,5.5532,1.0507,2.0828,1.4573,3.579,5.0378,1.4199,0.8449,0.2363,6.9768,1.1869,2.0189,3.2051,2.2328,1.7399,4.8886,1.5694,0.783,5.0682,3.7729,0.5175,5.3207,2.8763,1.2556,3.6502,0.9556,4.1844,2.4841,6.292,1.8102,1.6674,2.1934,5.354,0.2244,1.9088,0.2868,4.4928,0.9197,0.8974,3.4136,3.2495,5.5377,0.7983,2.5069,2.616,2.3617,4.0591,1.6953,4.4066,4.1025,3.5238,0.9516,1.7993,1.2007,2.9402,1.6205,0.1561,2.9886,2.9552,2.2782,2.7774,0.8076,1.0862,0.0866,3.0097,1.7455,1.519,1.286,1.2094,0.0001,3.4875,0.6749,3.7012,3.8747,1.4617,5.6081,6.4984,3.0739,4.5351,0.7999,4.5998,1.9915,5.3295,0.4836,6.6778,0.2598,2.8522,0.3389,3.3025,4.4775,1.4361,1.1752,3.726,0.3738,4.6385,0.8241,4.4362,3.9289,1.6773,3.997,1.9087,5.2059,0.9916,2.7951,0.2752,3.48,1.6597,5.4919,2.2634,1.744,3.9744,3.3806,1.3142,3.4008,4.6071,0.1676,3.0822,5.0209,0.0023,0.7353,2.3925,1.3929,2.3027,2.5382,3.6753,0.0245,1.8807,0.3876,1.003,1.0389,0.0001,3.55,0.6054,4.798,5.5605,2.3025,0.9763,3.2678,4.1986,5.7044,1.9944,1.0809,1.0953,1.4178,3.3841,1.7862,1.6832,1.2258,0.9147,0.8487,4.4966,0.2829,5.439,5.3338,2.3724,0.0063,3.5949,0.1514,4.0892,5.1894,0.057,0.4955,7.3213,1.7663,5.5159,0.8625,1.8432,4.1493,5.169,6.5362,3.7642,1.0585,1.1288,0.974,5.1422,0.3269,6.0718,1.0047,1.3457,0.0001,2.25,5.0826,1.5066,4.5664,1.8132,4.2557,5.6215,1.3987,1.3024,1.7865,4.1581,1.6925,6.0805,1.0914,5.7269,1.1168,0.518,5.0351,1.9055,0.1237,0.5978,4.3441,4.314,2.399,5.0329,0.7644,2.8844,4.0879,0.9821,3.9186,4.948,4.3775,2.4665,3.737,4.091,4.4641,1.5431,0.7713,1.9377,4.871,0.6772,0.3749,0.038,2.0659,0.3049,2.5676,1.653,3.9014,0.5399,2.9302,0.3682,4.2237,0.8818,1.0638,3.9919,0.6457,4.1808,3.058,2.8448,0.0004,2.7657,1.4644,1.2223,1.9819,2.5715,3.3908,0.5067,4.1685,1.316,2.3955,2.4125,4.0539,2.3403,2.5011,0.8899,1.6963,5.0043,0.1624,4.3381,1.461,2.2309,0.2394,6.0183,3.9658,2.2574,1.4582,2.2343,2.8426,5.8102,2.3513,5.3962,0.9214,0.0121,0.0298,0.0556,1.7329,3.6147,1.7743,2.9515,4.4274,0.3624,2.3733,1.0135,1.8067,5.6667,2.1347,5.6942,2.5226,2.0906,2.3201,3.3627,2.1872,0.7754,1.3763,1.7448,4.7638,0.7555,0.3144,0.0005,0.061,0.184,2.0964,0.43,0.0002,3.8424,1.6213,0.0127,2.4528,5.6498,2.6421,5.0413,2.2599,1.6675,3.769,1.1324,1.04]}

The work on this site reflects the values and practices of those that own and operate these pieces, as we believe these pieces are the best thing we could've made together.\n\nAdvertisements","token_len":433,"entropy":[7.4149,2.8649,12.3852,4.4781,1.7488,6.0687,4.2132,5.9974,4.9016,0.1657,9.2287,0.2815,0.2487,9.0636,2.796,11.9325,1.8716,5.1921,3.0333,5.9274,5.1883,3.4739,4.9872,7.3848,0.545,8.3086,1.4569,0.6944,1.2631,0.0051,7.0263,3.1433,0.0095,8.676,6.0174,0.0103,0.3021,1.729,0.0024,0.0004,0.004,0.0041,0.0019,0.0065,0.0018,0.0023,0.0058,0.0011,0.0014,0.0011,0.0019,0.0006,4.5452,0.2315,6.316,2.7607,0.1484,0.1166,5.545,0.0931,0.248,0.1736,0.0019,0.1476,0.2183,0.007,0.0013,0.0173,0.038,0.0634,0.0445,0.0082,0.0582,0.0112,0.0047,0.0024,0.0065,0.0026,0.0363,1.0635,0.1995,1.2152,0.6427,0.0475,0.0962,0.2383,0.0388,0.3408,0.314,0.0018,0.0406,0.1274,0.0026,0.0004,0.0101,0.013,0.0033,0.0104,0.0032,0.0019,0.0063,0.0021,0.0011,0.0029,0.0006,7.4865,1.7694,2.9036,6.0061,0.6683,1.7048,5.3483,2.2849,3.2088,0.7276,1.7481,3.0904,1.852,0.2251,4.7409,5.0949,2.2752,3.2603,1.1152,6.5069,2.4935,2.0731,0.2127,0.7461,1.0332,6.743,0.0711,2.5631,2.2573,1.8511,0.2572,1.8303,0.0267,0.8169,0.289,0.0002,7.041,5.062,6.4049,3.7707,5.4743,2.0304,4.0265,3.9389,3.1355,0.5539,0.8777,3.663,1.1829,2.005,5.6513,2.3948,5.8143,0.3487,1.5812,5.7023,4.1454,3.5887,5.8378,0.8918,3.9653,0.7877,1.1077,2.5792,2.7008,2.0712,2.1911,0.0002,4.4485,3.6888,5.1025,0.659,3.8767,2.3275,0.166,1.0284,5.8525,0.3448,2.672,2.2975,1.0922,2.4544,0.0552,1.1534,4.7,2.0847,4.7211,0.3467,0.7523,1.2523,0.7448,2.7643,2.6933,4.3238,6.5727,0.9558,1.9764,1.5822,1.8448,3.393,1.6249,1.8,0.9711,1.4384,0.1161,2.2126,0.9527,1.0476,0.0002,3.784,0.7592,2.9299,2.0352,5.25,2.648,1.9653,4.5284,2.821,2.5736,1.2122,5.7992,1.8179,0.9484,3.6455,4.3825,5.4648,4.9279,0.9416,0.6371,0.0003,5.622,1.0917,0.0148,0.1697,3.5937,0.4704,3.5104,1.2191,4.565,2.8503,4.6973,3.2803,2.6413,4.221,0.3343,5.2984,3.5798,6.1201,1.4267,5.1907,5.8396,3.047,0.6082,3.0724,1.476,1.2937,2.5934,5.709,2.2913,1.5097,0.9271,1.3381,1.7843,2.2981,4.8378,0.7218,2.4355,2.5024,3.3824,0.5057,0.0003,5.2298,0.7828,0.0003,3.5904,4.6997,5.5051,5.0464,0.6299,4.2498,5.4696,0.4335,5.8109,6.0102,3.8722,0.0235,1.9175,2.0306,5.8722,1.4526,1.7337,5.6225,0.8887,0.3343,4.6103,4.5107,0.0393,4.7019,5.8309,1.4946,1.6296,4.9584,3.1322,3.7763,0.3423,4.4288,0.1256,5.5306,1.9689,1.1403,1.8936,1.005,2.3059,1.8297,1.9452,1.8822,3.6412,2.7821,4.3025,1.6002,5.4751,0.6769,0.3046,1.6034,2.7042,7.1604,2.0735,3.4676,2.3275,3.9045,0.0147,2.7661,0.6537,1.0031,0.0003,4.5931,4.0556,2.7821,0.3949,6.228,1.1606,5.5219,5.3778,1.159,3.8151,3.8979,1.1649,5.1338,0.0202,0.0004,5.052,1.2002,2.5556,0.4893,1.2201,3.2501,4.4239,2.0654,5.1617,0.1662,0.7672,1.4212,1.9703,4.3521,0.0005,2.2865,0.9228,1.946,4.2209,3.7357,4.9088,1.754,6.1577,4.7511,2.6524,0.9178,0.8896,2.7541,2.3546,4.9162,4.7212,1.8319,2.2788,0.3441,2.9584,2.544,6.2711,1.6678,1.8245,0.9722,3.3596,2.9948,2.1257,0.4402,3.4213,6.3804,1.3888,4.6972,1.6114,4.4999,0.4182,4.3589,3.2152,5.4947,1.1559,1.4738,2.8212,3.2926,2.097,2.8245,3.6796,3.8267,3.074,1.3088,1.118,2.161,1.6288,4.2424,2.4568,1.9439,4.12,4.6987,1.0157,0.2483,0.7,0.0003,5.2956]}
{"id":3320,"ended":true,"length":398,"gen_text":"Someone has, for the first time, discovered a sport they enjoy playing.\n\n\"It was in the way that somebody would approach us and we wouldn't react because nobody would say hi to us,\" says Rizvi.\n\nThe idea in the first place was that players could interact with each other and share food and drink. This had been before Rizvi and his brother had ever played in an amateur game. He wanted to put his efforts into creating these things but he also wanted to do some science. His dad was always fascinated by the sport of fishing and the potential it would bring to the fishing community.\n\nHe wanted to see if there was some way to use any one of those features. So he found the first ever game that allowed the players to interact with each other with little plastic containers. Using a toy that had the capacity to contain and transport weight, he bought it, placed it in the field and then took off carrying it on top of some of the other animals.\n\nThey found that the food in this bag contained small quantities of seeds. Rizvi said that the seeds were too tiny to be effective in controlling the fish. He hoped that using them in the game would give fishermen some way of controlling which particular species can mate with each other.\n\nFinally the game caught their attention, because it was a first and obvious way of interacting with the fish. The researchers had planned on doing this because fishing could provide the fish with any means of food that it had not known it could drink.\n\n\"Once they were eating the food, it would get them moving and getting their heads up,\" Rizvi says.\n\nNow this is a very exciting thing. One that can be used in very long ways in your home.\n\n\"I do think it's extremely exciting that you can be able to feed those large numbers of fishes by using simple game. The fish will actually be hungry when it can move its head up,\" Rizvi continues.\n\nThis video has been published under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 United States License.","token_len":433,"entropy":[4.9161,5.9584,2.8579,3.2493,1.5554,0.0287,0.432,5.2335,2.6914,9.2702,4.7604,4.0883,3.5786,1.7145,1.4061,0.0004,1.5163,1.6836,2.9337,5.1893,1.4635,6.0251,2.4085,7.0559,3.0171,5.1278,2.996,1.5852,4.4937,3.8092,0.0008,5.2495,3.7039,5.3265,1.9679,3.3925,5.3679,1.1351,0.6388,0.9146,2.394,5.5287,4.9638,2.0618,0.2912,1.122,0.0002,2.9244,4.2669,6.5726,1.8308,1.8246,0.1592,0.8361,1.5425,4.7838,2.9962,4.7264,0.4272,0.7914,0.0137,1.6873,3.7868,4.4522,1.1951,0.779,0.8399,3.9279,4.5175,1.9504,4.7543,4.7311,0.0714,0.0087,2.3509,0.8281,3.4037,2.4279,2.5259,1.6298,2.9366,3.3727,3.9399,1.3457,0.4751,3.4694,3.8951,0.2779,4.7846,2.3104,5.7161,0.3581,3.1908,5.8254,3.9332,5.1382,1.7605,2.6005,0.546,0.3319,3.532,4.3518,5.8498,0.8261,4.866,4.004,1.9083,5.3755,3.7284,0.6362,1.4963,3.5004,2.0609,4.1078,1.0342,3.23,5.1219,2.1454,2.8726,1.2285,0.8659,1.1392,3.4432,1.608,0.2423,0.3686,0.0002,2.8208,2.9511,0.2353,3.1005,1.1884,1.997,0.7183,3.5676,1.0696,0.5163,4.3905,5.7784,5.8374,0.4573,2.9627,5.779,2.0631,2.8622,0.7423,5.1677,2.5156,4.2134,4.9819,3.6739,2.3565,3.4598,3.1634,1.4068,0.0603,1.3749,0.6993,0.3362,0.0108,4.5095,4.6232,4.4754,4.0831,0.7726,5.9107,1.8672,5.2913,3.4469,2.6086,3.8005,5.2124,0.3118,4.7305,5.7857,2.9136,5.6404,0.7637,1.3949,5.4319,2.6646,3.1759,4.0058,0.1569,0.7896,1.3244,4.9874,0.5414,3.0432,3.6254,3.1241,5.5922,0.4251,3.8798,5.1475,0.0441,5.356,2.9165,0.2877,1.3998,3.981,0.8651,0.6325,0.0001,5.0973,4.4271,1.169,1.6012,4.4948,3.2365,2.5948,5.531,2.37,5.6214,3.0566,0.0221,5.786,2.1154,2.4913,0.0145,0.0028,4.0505,1.3652,2.4159,1.8072,1.1224,5.2393,3.4808,0.4779,1.2742,5.4729,1.2189,3.7284,1.3828,3.5413,1.4494,2.0358,5.234,0.6433,4.2035,2.6529,2.1767,1.4875,1.1868,0.3955,2.7529,4.4752,3.3079,3.3516,1.3093,1.0893,5.3263,6.1741,1.9864,5.7464,5.4022,1.4405,0.7725,0.0151,0.4848,0.4014,0.0002,5.9761,3.4599,2.2163,4.3519,3.7177,0.3279,2.7003,3.9306,1.4233,1.1754,2.1034,4.7762,3.2984,5.658,1.3852,1.5553,4.3664,0.2586,1.4107,1.5499,0.2576,2.2426,4.3444,3.4489,4.7764,1.9432,3.1924,1.0936,3.9554,3.8622,4.123,4.5142,2.6366,1.7203,0.1567,6.0379,4.7441,0.5391,3.6182,2.779,2.312,3.5634,1.7281,4.1272,2.6899,0.9665,5.9686,0.5866,0.9699,0.0002,1.8915,5.169,2.4312,2.8364,4.004,1.6091,1.352,0.8063,2.3061,2.2358,4.1532,3.4225,5.0199,1.4763,4.4182,2.7524,3.2981,1.4962,1.4127,2.1238,0.0042,0.0008,0.3259,0.0552,1.0185,0.0001,4.5769,4.878,2.3965,1.8637,3.2285,1.9138,3.3754,0.9607,4.712,2.9505,3.7529,0.9483,1.5775,1.5616,5.325,5.014,3.4881,3.6533,5.4705,2.7241,0.9707,1.2809,0.0002,1.8652,2.0455,5.2751,0.9857,1.3026,1.0957,5.9342,1.1045,2.1224,3.3423,0.7709,2.897,0.5414,0.0059,5.467,5.2487,5.0508,1.8903,0.0577,3.5863,4.9428,1.408,5.5649,5.082,3.62,3.2071,2.807,1.7049,4.6719,1.9776,4.6927,3.0284,2.175,4.84,4.0783,3.6484,0.3791,0.8389,3.0854,1.4011,0.0046,0.0006,4.7139,0.0412,0.4837,0.0002,3.1714,4.1315,3.3625,0.1359,3.7711,3.8071,0.1573,0.0023,0.0003,1.2113,0.2375,0.12,0.0712,0.1744,0.1477,0.0027,0.0,0.3364,0.1227,0.0002,0.0048,2.8754,0.0224,0.0113,0.4689]}
{"id":3977,"ended":true,"length":408,"gen_text":"The council can not reach an agreement, the sacred battle will break the tie. The holy weapons are placed in the arena, The Rock, The Paper, and The Sissors.\n\nIn the final battle, the enemy will fall on the final stage\n\nThe final arena will play out as normal on top of the rock\n\nThe Rock that's supposed to play a part of the battle ends on the final stage\n\nFinally we saw some more things after the game. The game starts off well in the middle with no issues and still very difficult. However, it actually happens a lot in the middle, sometimes being stopped by one or two enemy heroes with one ending and the other ending with a very hard reset for each hero. Sometimes the second hero starts off the normal state which is very hard to predict.\n\nAfter a while more difficult battle starts to happen. Sometimes hero is trying to push back hard and even after a couple of heroes push back, it feels like the game will go on forever, there is so much drama and the ending will feel really long. But during the second game it also feels good. Also the enemies in this game are really good, so for this game it's hard to not notice what's happening in the middle when it becomes very hard to predict where the enemy will fall.\n\nIt's definitely possible to pick up a great game and start off on your own. However I think there is more to the game than that: This is the game I would personally take for a vacation in Korea if I were a new fan as they had always done an amazing job of teaching me this kind of game. That's why I would like to start off with you: The Games by Lee Sedol.\n\nI also enjoyed playing this game and this I won't miss at my next visit. It's a very long game and I think I didn't even get the chance to enjoy the final chapter before. Let's see if those words make me feel better over the next two days.\n\nCheers,\n\nLee\n\nEdited by Pee-young, 20 April 2017 - 02:40 PM.","token_len":436,"entropy":[9.0354,4.9916,5.4516,6.6541,1.9678,0.0877,3.7035,3.5243,12.4401,7.5615,2.6836,5.7791,7.3584,5.5004,1.5615,2.3738,7.2015,7.5552,2.1352,7.0182,1.315,0.8688,5.9326,1.6005,7.2293,8.0149,3.4807,3.7225,9.2643,0.8621,1.7152,1.4433,6.3922,8.7758,0.6306,1.668,0.0174,3.8793,1.3118,3.6785,1.5401,0.4048,1.2063,5.7128,1.9117,4.437,3.1297,0.872,5.4551,3.0607,5.7954,0.0003,1.8038,3.2394,5.5664,1.8097,6.2478,1.7704,2.2577,4.846,4.6356,4.3923,0.0653,0.6452,5.4341,2.2265,0.0003,1.1727,3.4123,6.4929,4.4504,4.8897,0.0045,5.66,3.6441,3.4007,3.1449,0.4815,1.8596,5.7594,4.1784,1.2668,1.6201,0.2017,1.0442,0.0002,6.0541,4.3381,5.4166,3.9007,3.5491,5.5099,6.3298,0.677,3.8256,1.0494,2.023,3.4,3.2779,1.9201,3.9553,4.0686,1.5298,1.5194,2.4148,3.509,5.3646,2.703,5.3783,3.8096,4.6437,1.2269,3.1648,0.5108,2.6811,5.4474,5.6774,2.2563,0.7586,2.0974,0.5093,1.7785,2.5293,4.8129,5.2723,5.4759,0.7912,4.2562,1.9709,0.61,3.9828,3.9679,4.3974,4.3274,6.3301,2.2894,1.8959,0.4604,0.4395,3.8127,1.3534,3.8425,3.3524,4.6863,5.1684,4.0563,0.8569,0.4136,4.187,1.7022,5.582,2.2683,4.1764,1.7025,3.2326,4.75,5.1125,5.0958,1.1365,2.6734,1.4536,0.8876,3.0246,1.2291,1.5478,0.0002,3.3034,2.5501,1.2708,6.0475,4.8899,4.8502,2.2789,2.7985,1.3569,1.3184,2.8386,4.8409,2.5744,5.064,0.0791,4.2313,1.9864,6.1084,1.7326,5.1818,4.3566,1.4178,2.8984,0.542,2.2466,2.924,0.2882,1.4862,2.3913,4.5684,0.4335,1.4064,1.7733,2.8786,2.8323,1.8925,1.8352,2.9859,4.6922,1.2651,4.1841,0.128,5.1113,1.3435,2.8608,4.4076,2.1376,3.1011,3.9167,3.6201,0.4809,3.4589,5.8829,0.7085,3.7135,3.0294,2.6,4.2742,0.8849,4.1393,1.492,5.4081,1.813,5.059,3.8978,2.8274,0.6586,1.2318,2.7106,2.2949,1.5974,3.2541,4.911,2.7369,1.0631,1.7765,1.6617,2.7976,0.2595,3.1264,3.6384,4.2287,1.7993,1.0166,2.1928,0.4852,0.7694,5.0459,2.2569,5.3078,3.0484,0.8197,1.2842,0.4862,5.0465,0.7388,2.2463,1.3825,2.8179,0.6374,0.5001,0.0002,3.7568,0.8126,4.0871,4.3108,0.547,4.6544,0.781,1.5744,5.187,2.2947,2.4112,5.2392,2.8494,2.6961,4.4177,1.5089,1.2104,2.8136,3.1239,1.828,2.7397,1.5183,3.5092,0.7311,1.9888,0.7374,0.9291,0.9486,5.3292,5.449,1.5407,1.9157,1.8877,2.985,2.6086,5.0095,5.2813,2.9436,1.3699,2.5674,3.4729,4.9291,3.1759,0.3888,1.9207,2.8336,3.4116,3.6409,6.3357,4.7907,4.7726,4.7597,3.8883,3.8383,0.7468,0.3915,1.6824,3.8246,0.4133,4.556,3.4103,0.0012,0.6308,0.4617,5.3796,0.9042,0.6327,0.2481,2.6276,2.3481,0.0798,3.8684,1.3853,1.3834,6.1865,4.1541,2.8635,6.4835,4.772,4.6013,4.4964,0.0665,1.4237,0.9578,0.0003,3.338,3.871,3.7954,2.462,1.5874,0.1609,2.3502,4.7584,6.2374,4.6358,0.1227,4.1954,4.3386,7.0481,1.3976,3.0728,0.9259,3.3419,0.5106,1.6301,2.1837,4.051,0.4334,1.039,1.3753,2.6555,1.8568,6.7059,0.0006,2.886,2.9072,2.4088,0.56,0.0171,4.8187,1.7985,3.6484,3.9291,4.0363,3.557,5.1366,0.494,1.7243,1.6744,6.9876,3.4045,4.1257,1.7837,1.5067,0.7665,5.9743,0.6163,0.5931,3.679,1.1369,0.6615,0.563,0.0003,4.333,0.0124,1.2097,0.2929,0.0002,2.3157,1.7379,0.0003,4.5696,0.2959,5.6184,3.9765,2.5798,4.0923,1.4422,4.8408,2.7545,1.4876,0.0338,2.3205,0.0026,4.1155,0.3565,0.0171]}
{"id":3893,"ended":false,"length":392,"gen_text":"It's Always Sunny Meets The Purge' and 'It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia', and I'm hoping we can turn this around.\n\nSo far, I feel like this is the beginning for everyone to start asking what it is all about and what's on the horizon.\n\nI was once called 'Godzilla' and 'Monster Man' by 'The Godfather' and he wanted to put his head on the pole. I actually became the new 'Godzilla'\u2026 it was always so weird, people who were calling the monster their real identity would yell out for it, 'Godzilla'. Then I was the director of 'Star Trek: Voyager,' we were asked what it was all about, and I just said it's really exciting to see the next Marvel project, but it's really 'Godzilla' and 'Monster Man.'\n\nI just never thought about it until we did 'Batman', and I just got into the series so excited. I've been shooting the last three episodes of the show. It was so surreal to have a film, like this movie.\n\nWe met when we got to work at New Zealand Studios where they did one of the amazing, awesome, epic Marvel set photos, with Michael Fassbender, who is working on 'Thor: The Dark World.' I thought: This is something really special. Why the hell should we be in this place? It's the place that we always thought was going to look great, this one's different, and we're just doing our best to make it as good as possible.\n\nThe film is going to be amazing and I think we'll be able to do more. One of the things we have very focused on is that I am a director of Marvel movies, where we focus on that. We also make movies that will have different types of fans over them. So it's going to be weird.\n\nYou can actually see the trailer of Marvel Comics' upcoming solo Justice League movie in the trailer below.

I did everything I knew was right \u2014 and all so I could say the truth.\n\nIt is a truth that is impossible to ignore, because that's how reality works.\n\nToday's news broke yesterday : The 9-year old son of one of America's largest immigration fugitives recently came home for school, only to find his mother murdered. A witness said that his mother's body was found on the side of the road near a small creek just south of Houston. One person tells us her daughter told police she died sometime during the night, and later that day she said she left school, never returned. She testified about the attack.\n\nShe made some of the key statements. She said her daughter, the 7-year old daughter of a former Mexican diplomat from Mexico who recently arrived in Houston, died after being stabbed in the stomach. She told police that her daughter was the victim of gang rape by some gang members, which turned out to be untrue.\n\nThe mother is now working as a nurse at an assisted living center, and her son is home alone because she's afraid for him. The two days her toddler remains at home as they watched the killings unfold, she had to pull him to the side of the road because she feared for the very life she'd saved him, and because she thought that maybe his mother was going to be there when she died.\n\nNow my son is home safely, in the intensive care unit of IHS Children's Health Center, in Houston.

{"id":3306,"ended":true,"length":425,"gen_text":"God reveals themselves to exist and confirms they did create your world. This is all fine and dandy until you start exploring space and find other worlds have their own, equally egotistical gods.\n\nGod says that in the coming days he will summon many beings of light to his own people. In this form he will also announce how great has been his power to humans. This will make you feel much better about life in those times where your future was better or worse than it was and thus make you feel like you've been chosen.\n\nWhen this occurs you will begin to see things differently and the world around you will have been changed by your new powers. Your people who were before you will be replaced with better ones but for now you are still the same with your universe. This will be an amazing period of time and will make you feel as though your being is a constant, and you'll love it when things go well.\n\nYou will start your journey to your new home where your humanity will change, and there will be a new and much better world to follow. This means that the other world will also have good things to offer you in this age of digital and mobile technology. You will have a lot to like from this time of future and from your journey you can be sure that your next planet will be one of the best places on earth which will set you right.\n\nNow then, is this a \"cosmic story\" or a \"space story?\" This is something that I think you could always explore over and over again because it is that simple as that. Even after you begin trying these things out it will always feel amazing to hear from people about their experience with space, if it is just a story. The more people read this you will naturally start to see this as a very important thing and I think that it is worth exploring a lot in your life as a person if you do not want to go through that yet.\n\nYou might also like: Space Chronicles will feature a story about how Space Adventures helps people and people who can never even make it outside their sphere, by helping people like YOU bring people into space.","token_len":438,"entropy":[10.2426,5.4345,1.1534,7.0514,2.8428,8.6673,4.7159,5.0768,7.1322,7.4493,2.2852,0.7335,3.7514,1.0995,4.5877,7.0453,0.2393,0.6758,0.0,4.3863,0.6589,4.129,6.5342,7.7993,1.2026,4.4679,4.6411,2.5608,10.4821,3.4713,0.2105,4.7518,6.461,9.2536,2.6284,0.057,4.3091,1.0422,1.7835,0.0604,6.5063,4.868,2.2822,4.232,1.5188,4.9527,1.8056,2.39,0.2511,5.03,5.0889,4.1373,2.8011,3.1571,1.4914,3.4617,3.3128,4.2188,1.2908,3.5415,2.3273,4.8383,1.7595,0.6603,3.7284,5.4908,4.6756,4.1778,6.2965,0.3298,1.0275,1.6805,2.8375,5.6618,0.9546,2.8809,1.7769,3.302,2.0818,1.7966,4.4038,1.125,0.9876,4.3852,2.9954,5.6575,2.6821,4.9262,2.8344,5.9727,4.0507,5.8737,3.9755,0.9857,1.3203,2.1713,1.2049,4.9183,4.7523,3.3825,0.2351,1.1008,3.0256,0.609,3.0937,1.62,3.9926,1.1527,1.1581,0.0002,3.7758,3.3761,3.396,1.6793,0.581,3.8393,0.2752,2.0117,3.1526,3.4304,1.8456,3.6984,2.0884,2.4697,0.0104,0.6336,3.9868,3.2575,1.8497,2.8587,2.2091,3.7631,3.1084,0.2988,3.6505,4.9086,5.9916,2.0257,4.3048,0.3133,0.5603,1.6492,4.6459,2.1644,5.3052,1.8395,5.101,4.8429,2.1174,1.1055,1.9222,2.2084,2.3351,0.1932,5.7881,1.8904,6.1217,0.7266,2.6721,1.4844,2.1113,3.703,2.5284,5.3765,0.5003,1.0197,1.6622,3.2406,2.7547,0.4352,0.6218,3.6627,1.0114,2.6486,4.9114,1.1352,3.3479,5.0197,2.5316,3.9487,2.4798,3.0382,5.5149,1.1259,3.007,3.7058,2.0984,1.3299,0.6428,0.4656,0.0002,2.7244,0.8476,3.9667,5.1633,1.2316,2.3175,3.8527,1.5302,1.935,3.7401,2.4323,5.7142,0.6259,3.9236,2.7783,1.5745,4.1281,0.5261,0.1507,1.7987,1.5206,4.2503,4.0696,1.3139,1.3787,1.3362,4.1341,0.5358,2.4365,4.1148,0.7621,2.9989,5.5687,2.7852,0.7223,3.3225,2.1175,5.8231,1.2462,0.3144,2.1734,1.3205,3.2626,3.2224,5.762,0.648,4.8284,2.7831,3.8653,2.2859,0.4512,2.5061,0.5752,2.4561,1.6274,2.9967,1.6602,5.5039,3.7084,1.9535,2.2381,2.1596,5.3998,1.7312,5.6611,3.1807,4.8265,1.7948,3.0673,2.8961,0.7547,0.5163,2.1442,4.9045,5.4478,0.2483,0.5735,3.0396,1.8352,0.7513,1.4759,2.0385,1.5877,1.2738,5.963,0.8544,5.6856,0.1733,4.537,1.2983,0.3026,0.0002,4.0052,4.4772,0.8343,5.0615,1.8826,2.5854,5.0685,5.3672,0.1827,5.1145,1.0762,0.8276,1.4154,1.0281,4.0594,0.6165,2.1486,3.7693,0.5747,3.9267,1.015,1.9863,2.7103,2.3203,4.0934,5.1049,5.1452,6.4236,1.1507,0.0016,0.7195,4.8403,1.5406,1.3622,5.7792,2.4405,5.657,0.7734,0.2215,6.1385,4.5341,1.3023,4.8775,6.7128,4.8081,0.6916,0.6013,3.1317,1.2391,2.2746,2.8173,5.2147,1.0572,4.7312,2.5998,1.8205,3.1806,2.5808,2.5123,1.7013,3.2055,3.0235,5.7914,2.96,1.2226,3.7539,1.1808,2.1668,1.9346,3.7276,2.333,2.3461,4.759,2.333,2.6667,0.415,5.7766,1.9042,0.1976,1.5525,3.9922,1.0347,0.9641,3.5857,2.6381,2.5927,1.9907,2.3269,1.5108,1.5688,2.3046,1.2897,3.7429,2.1705,3.9693,1.4254,3.0831,1.6007,1.8264,2.3112,2.9497,2.2045,5.0273,0.1974,3.2996,0.9573,1.4222,0.1084,3.3557,1.7878,3.0803,5.0146,0.3264,0.4178,0.0002,3.5085,3.1484,1.2284,0.7474,0.7913,5.0045,5.497,6.1057,4.9322,1.5282,3.8339,1.3918,2.9747,4.8831,4.8165,6.0903,2.7888,3.6894,3.9045,2.8832,4.6211,3.9131,5.7311,3.9152,0.1341,4.5032,2.7177,5.8148,3.6452,5.2132,4.6773,1.7655,3.8556,5.7926,5.9062,3.1397,2.7123,1.4053,0.9152]}
{"id":2976,"ended":true,"length":402,"gen_text":"After surviving an electric shock, you discover that you now have the ability to send and recieve signals to all electronic devices. How will you use your newfound gift?\n\nYour choice. If you're new to digital devices (like Kindle device, Mac), then you can choose to have your smartphone or tablet automatically download digital audio-visual files. This will enable you to download digital music from iTunes, Google Play Music and others.\n\n. Now you can create your own digital audio-visual file on each device, or choose to upload multiple digital audio-visual files.\n\n. New to digital devices : The first step will be to set up an account! This is the first step on your device list where you can connect to any audio-visual files available through an online or mobile app.\n\n: New to Android devices : In a separate window in your Google Play Music app > Settings > Music, create an Audio-visual file, then click the Upload Audio-visual file button, and an app using your Google account should show up.\n\n. Open the file you've uploaded and make a note of the audio-visual file and the description on the file as it applies to the Android devices you're using. You can view the Audio-visual file on your device using the menu bar.\n\nIn this example, the two file names are the same.\n\nYou can then import and export audio-visual files as an individual app app.\n\nConclusion\n\nI'd say that you've definitely given yourself a new appreciation as to how to use an Android device. What are some of the different aspects of your experience that you're learning to take from using an Apple device and share with the rest of the world? Is there a better way for you to contribute to society and create a better world?

The only use remaining is space probes and planetary rovers, and you are one such AI awakening to consciousness on or around a world for the first time.\n\nIn fact, in the year 2000, scientists on Earth began creating humanoid technology for space travelers. In 2003 Dr. Koon et al. created the 'Abridged' AI - a version of the humans using AI devices that could move within and around the body.\n\nThe Abridged AI works by using a robotic body computer and computer programming to manipulate human human limbs and give them commands such as'move'. The AI machine processes this information with the use of multiple robots. To this day, the AI remains on Earth for only 500 years.\n\nBy creating such the AI, which is very much like a human, humanity's mission is more complete than ever.\n\nWith the creation of AI technologies in the past several years, it would appear the situation is getting better than ever - humanity will be able to achieve an asteroid mine mission and the Earth will be habitable for decades.\n\nAt present, a global survey found that the human race has reached a total of 100 billion people - and some 80 million people are now living on average in Earth.\n\nThe most advanced humans on earth today are the 5'14\"-5'18\" (170 kg) - with only around 40 percent capable of using artificial intelligence.\n\nIf we can find ways to provide artificial intelligence access to the life sciences of other species, we will start to address these issues with technology that is more efficient and easier to communicate with each other like human beings can today and beyond. And when the time comes, if necessary, we will start using the latest tools for this purpose, so that we will not only be able to send information directly to the humans, but we will be able to communicate with each other on the go, where we might even live. At this moment, one of humanity's most advanced creations will be able to send out signals directly from this new form of civilization - through the very tools of artificial intelligence, that will be using human intelligence today.","token_len":445,"entropy":[10.6728,7.1469,7.7293,9.964,2.9107,2.2869,5.0062,2.9187,5.2283,2.1848,9.4767,5.1489,3.8637,0.9237,2.9982,3.801,6.4282,9.7851,1.1613,9.6679,5.1637,1.7028,6.7801,6.9367,0.0094,1.8818,1.8379,5.3212,2.9563,5.4915,7.4826,7.3385,12.7136,3.3969,8.2142,3.6692,8.3715,1.5352,3.2464,3.9731,6.1284,0.6973,0.1765,0.0003,0.3852,1.4135,0.0063,3.706,4.1033,0.1205,3.6452,1.4451,4.7314,2.2547,0.3659,4.6083,4.4025,1.2878,2.7897,4.6552,4.3161,5.6917,2.8319,4.2,6.2455,0.9481,2.7503,4.2981,6.2231,0.4801,5.3219,5.8572,6.3141,0.0434,0.3621,3.0153,1.3654,5.2996,4.235,5.8471,0.1578,3.6719,1.3894,2.904,1.2676,5.0136,0.0505,1.2405,5.2814,5.9151,2.9849,5.5137,2.5906,2.0114,4.9324,5.2734,2.6169,2.3675,1.4948,2.1976,1.4531,1.8492,0.0004,2.1611,2.4134,0.0519,0.0046,0.2743,5.8548,1.0187,2.9506,2.05,5.0163,2.8908,6.5119,2.5323,3.7519,4.0161,1.0059,4.2288,3.4787,6.0831,4.7039,1.1761,5.7753,0.7461,5.2409,2.8093,0.0044,12.1082,5.3703,9.2641,1.9246,1.5462,6.0372,5.9509,3.3227,2.0835,4.6281,1.7568,4.4628,0.0018,6.0332,4.7741,2.0025,5.3761,4.0505,0.7679,0.7561,1.5705,1.6675,4.5451,4.0279,0.73,2.5723,4.1887,5.8859,0.6004,0.6916,0.4743,0.0002,5.1522,3.5523,4.6365,5.8738,0.866,1.0107,5.4855,1.5544,4.3424,2.871,1.3098,1.695,0.9608,1.1312,5.4955,3.7857,5.1454,0.8719,5.0369,3.1315,1.3871,0.6886,0.5583,1.8774,0.0002,4.7512,1.4065,3.7607,0.0254,2.0302,3.8742,2.9903,1.1264,2.5152,4.5092,0.9205,0.2135,2.5482,4.4724,2.1335,3.4149,5.4676,1.0764,2.0606,0.8765,5.3579,0.7896,3.6398,4.6398,3.8198,1.5459,0.3441,0.0127,4.0858,3.975,5.0547,5.3206,5.6689,2.7628,3.7425,4.6979,0.583,0.7402,2.9872,0.6835,4.0955,0.911,0.5562,0.0002,5.2484,1.9048,0.3599,3.8416,5.549,5.5569,6.5548,0.647,2.0556,2.9593,1.5596,1.409,1.2988,1.1754,3.6381,1.5854,4.3434,0.6729,1.3592,2.4061,2.4883,5.2557,4.1009,2.9058,2.4503,1.6878,2.6091,0.5504,0.8138,6.2675,1.7902,2.9439,0.9939,0.7632,0.0002,2.2013,4.8431,2.8109,3.4128,1.42,2.161,2.5397,0.6487,2.6525,5.6345,4.5689,6.4045,4.3601,0.8568,0.024,3.0379,0.4622,1.7603,4.8084,3.6491,0.2978,3.266,3.7474,3.9797,3.2689,3.8941,3.1392,7.0616,0.0261,4.2256,3.3965,0.1916,0.7602,0.6737,0.0002,4.5117,1.9547,2.495,3.5377,4.432,0.2572,5.4112,3.4327,0.0727,5.8909,0.2613,1.2268,6.1027,3.6621,2.6995,3.7468,1.7382,0.526,1.6202,1.0501,4.7627,0.5317,4.2652,3.429,1.1457,3.584,3.4701,1.955,1.6926,3.0399,3.2145,0.8534,4.0098,0.1102,5.292,0.2935,5.2167,0.0316,7.6329,3.4947,1.4466,3.0743,5.2362,4.3904,4.4417,0.0885,5.628,4.5969,2.8524,1.4278,0.1026,0.5136,5.248,6.3536,0.1892,0.8904,0.6896,2.9156,2.4416,2.6822,4.6282,4.1718,3.4222,2.5748,1.285,2.5528,3.7911,0.453,1.1368,1.9932,2.7041,0.9824,1.5044,0.2199,0.0056,4.1082,3.6113,3.5963,0.3253,1.4977,4.7335,1.1843,0.1334,1.7961,0.5001,1.1396,0.0546,0.017,2.3237,0.6722,2.3553,0.0211,3.3196,1.4373,4.568,2.4293,5.3579,1.047,5.2698,2.0156,3.8828,1.1646,7.0728,2.0724,2.0102,0.3968,5.3718,1.0312,4.0781,0.0155,1.2688,0.9243,5.8549,2.5273,0.7317,1.4492,0.011,2.0999,3.843,3.2002,2.7057,1.7819,4.0138,3.7077,3.6582,0.0635,5.7457,2.9791,5.0549,1.9069,5.0811,4.4837,1.6161,2.3557,0.0161,2.729,3.0359,1.6638,1.6568,5.6898,3.5594,1.9958,5.3251,0.9015]}

You are surprised to see people of almost similar level of intelligence who can work together to defeat aliens in other countries. Many have been sent to this great mission to learn new skills in their professions. Many have come here but there is nothing that is right for them. Many of them have fallen prey to fear of any alien.\nIt is a wonder what they have learned. No human is smarter than you, no matter the amount of trouble you have faced. This new generation has no better way to fight the alien menace. How many times have you watched as a child who was just starting out got sucked into a spaceship for one long time? Or a teenager who still can't catch a break? Even with your advanced intellect some new aliens will start questioning its origins and use them to begin a new and new world.\nYou understand, you believe that there is something about your actions. Just like you believe some of the other world leaders. They believe in you. Most leaders know you as their friend. This is not to say that they were not aware of what you meant or that your actions are not responsible for your actions. They merely want to prove that some group of people are superior (people are different people now ).\nYou love the game, but you want money.

During his six decade of sobriety, he said, he had never had anything he wanted. But then he found himself having his own private room, and being forced to play with his roommates.\n\n\"I started to have a very bad temper for it because I've done a lot of things the way I know I need to,\" he says. \"I was in rehab trying to change a couple things in my life, like when I used to be like, 'What's your deal, dude?' And I'm like, 'I can never go back to those.' \"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt some point the other three of them grew tired of each other.\n\n\"I'd tell [Ridley], 'I just hope you know what I'm doing and that your life is not going to change.' Like, 'What do you mean?'\" he says.\n\nWhat's been different about Riley's transformation, is the fact that he's finally been able to go forward and become a better man. And now he could be a man who looks back on his time at the game and realizes he can play that way even if it means leaving for a better life next time around. It's very easy to turn back the clock and pretend you're not a professional athlete on a regular basis. But this is a different time at the big-name sport of basketball, where being able to step away from that pressure is such an extremely challenging experience for a young man growing up.\n\n\"I'm just so grateful I was able to get where I am today,\" said Riley, who is now the co-director of the NBA Development League. \"Being able to play at an elite level is pretty awesome to me.

I thought the politicians weren't going to stop me getting up.'\n\nOne of the reasons why the campaign has resonated so much between supporters and detractors is because the campaign's success was the result of a number of initiatives, some of which were also found to be effective\n\nBut the group said it is too early to say whether the campaign can win any new funding for some of its activities, despite what MacKay and others have to say.\n\nBut the group's campaign manager, Ken Kostocke, suggested it could make more progress in its first quarter of the year.\n\nBruned on a $2million grant funded by the city of Vancouver, Kostocke said the campaign has the potential to give the city some $18,000 for public work in the first quarter of next year.\n\nMeanwhile, the group's director, Nick Robinson, said he is pleased with the work the campaign has done over the two days.\n\n'This is a very good result for us and we are definitely starting to see a lot of improvement,' Robinson said. 'We've also reached a significant percentage of our goal by taking a little bit more responsibility and looking at other things I should have been at my previous positions, such as putting the fire brigade on standby. I didn't think we could turn into an organisation that we were working on just because of those things.\n\n'It was a very good result, and it reflects well on our staff and on the general public.'\n\nThe campaign will meet again on Friday morning for a press conference about how the city can improve public housing\n\nOn Monday, the campaign will hold a panel discussion with leaders from the local authority about how Vancouver can better address housing affordability, including ways to improve social housing.","token_len":448,"entropy":[8.0192,6.8102,0.2351,3.0882,0.7076,5.61,6.6983,2.6468,3.7101,0.0008,2.8574,1.4977,1.3834,3.5605,0.0005,3.2605,6.0623,1.378,2.5755,0.1033,5.4754,4.0183,6.1684,2.5063,3.3111,2.9816,3.2768,5.2268,1.5032,5.4118,4.8404,2.8994,5.8805,2.6428,1.4069,1.7794,3.5934,1.7903,2.4812,3.9173,2.6933,4.4809,3.625,2.3012,0.1434,1.5674,6.0062,4.2242,1.2629,0.768,0.9812,3.6769,1.9968,0.0005,0.0985,1.7271,3.6992,6.9424,5.2397,4.4389,4.971,2.266,4.7862,5.1718,6.1797,0.2793,0.2187,4.5315,3.3372,2.7183,1.9007,3.5777,5.8529,2.333,2.7928,1.7499,1.5598,5.0324,5.6573,2.6774,1.4455,3.8349,4.7263,1.7491,2.3172,2.2955,4.0792,5.3376,3.9051,0.0003,2.2016,0.0539,4.0892,3.2209,3.55,0.3588,2.5919,0.0894,0.0004,5.1601,0.963,0.5695,5.1242,2.5855,2.0969,5.2393,2.4662,6.0235,0.004,0.643,1.3479,5.9631,3.9151,1.0731,2.4464,0.4142,1.2063,2.2443,3.9709,2.4012,3.906,3.1013,4.4318,0.2824,0.123,1.609,4.3117,0.0025,4.8876,2.1961,3.0626,0.29,0.1524,1.3881,5.289,5.6756,0.62,0.5572,2.0341,3.5397,0.0004,3.7659,2.2824,5.0425,3.3427,1.7503,2.816,4.2886,0.3361,0.0227,0.8042,1.0835,1.1366,1.6971,4.4586,4.3089,3.0513,4.0656,4.8885,2.6784,5.7796,0.4253,0.9859,3.1507,1.528,4.238,4.5585,3.5053,0.0018,1.8155,1.8,0.877,5.2885,0.0164,0.6228,0.0905,0.0003,4.2445,1.8809,0.884,2.7697,3.5503,0.6566,0.8525,5.4989,4.5302,4.2453,7.0914,2.6513,0.6671,5.6254,2.4402,1.9364,4.1908,3.9044,3.3303,2.1411,2.9275,2.8673,4.3603,2.3924,1.1578,0.1513,0.9405,0.124,0.0003,7.0475,4.938,7.4329,4.7547,3.9034,3.7781,3.0228,0.9543,2.5069,5.8086,0.1248,0.7478,3.6449,1.6507,2.839,0.5167,2.6705,0.0013,0.0051,0.0002,0.3492,1.1943,1.1494,1.9752,4.3709,1.1191,0.0304,5.2655,1.9816,0.5446,3.9588,3.5,5.1943,2.1946,0.1302,3.3186,5.6537,5.0772,2.4473,1.0528,0.8821,1.7244,0.4537,2.1163,0.0078,0.5127,0.1508,0.0003,5.7818,0.193,1.6263,2.1488,1.6787,3.5152,1.4305,5.4244,5.6426,0.0848,0.6081,1.8081,2.224,3.4469,1.1366,0.3268,4.6271,1.1529,0.4736,0.2322,0.5679,3.5307,0.0711,5.1,3.7506,2.5452,0.1212,0.0002,0.5788,3.0122,0.7625,1.1039,2.0992,2.0797,3.587,1.4252,2.2263,1.8522,1.3733,1.8838,5.478,4.9856,0.1306,0.9737,2.0944,1.058,0.4148,3.7193,1.2859,2.4289,0.2496,0.1152,1.9198,1.2925,2.1867,3.7892,5.8672,1.7732,4.7586,4.7659,0.3993,1.3338,2.5429,4.2406,5.2024,2.2753,3.8489,1.0378,1.1237,4.6905,1.8894,4.429,0.416,3.1369,1.3401,6.2367,5.757,0.9269,2.1005,6.2159,4.9337,1.6592,5.1668,2.4361,2.6306,0.0032,5.4945,2.9576,4.4813,1.4038,1.2208,1.5504,1.8241,4.836,5.6512,0.0003,1.8366,1.2863,1.4161,5.7469,3.7145,2.9761,2.4411,0.9285,3.1272,1.8477,4.5951,1.4272,5.23,1.2534,1.3481,5.5527,2.4045,1.2828,0.2409,0.0003,0.0959,2.4342,2.4362,1.3416,1.7855,1.478,1.266,2.1334,1.7333,2.118,6.1027,2.711,0.113,1.9786,4.3075,0.955,1.4592,0.8358,6.1739,2.2246,1.4879,0.5638,0.0003,1.9852,1.7662,2.9375,4.7651,1.4155,1.2618,2.3331,3.8278,2.388,0.9083,3.1447,0.0437,4.0744,3.4055,1.4584,3.2473,1.7457,2.3957,3.4331,3.766,2.9239,0.0003,4.9151,2.3414,0.5058,1.0897,1.9528,0.5137,2.3271,0.4444,5.0114,0.4459,2.7453,5.1356,0.9104,1.0491,3.4475,3.7122,1.987,1.0799,6.444,0.7111,2.8614,3.4204,2.4377,1.1731,1.9979,2.4334,4.6538,0.5492,2.5898,4.5867,0.3868,1.5407]}

But we know from some of the very low-energy studies where the energy is not being properly divided, it's being divided up in great big numbers so there's no reason for our society to be so interested in the physics of how much of it we're measuring,\" he adds.\n\nAnd perhaps that is due. The U.S. has recently shown that solar power \u2014 which uses almost two times less energy and is more expensive to operate than traditional power sources \u2014 is far less likely to cause a catastrophic warming of the planet than conventional energy sources.\n\n\"We know the results,\" says Thomas, \"but we've had no significant data of that type of measurement, where we've analyzed that before. So we need time to get this far.\"\n\nThe researchers don't want to be taken for granted, however, when it comes to the potential for an extreme event like this.\n\n\"This means we'll have to wait until the next one.

In comparison, the average lifespan is measured by the average life expectancy of the average 1\/2-year-old child in our country. In 1900, the average life expectancy for a 1\/2-year-old male in Germany was 6 years long, while at the beginning of the 20th Century, a 1\/2-year-old female is 12 years long. No one's life expectancy has been increased under those circumstances, because there was not sufficient data. The average life expectancy of 1.1 per 100 people in 1900 was 25 years, while during that same period 1.1 lives per 1,000 inhabitants of 1900 were born at... \u200e Appears in 2 books from 1982-2005\n\nLess","token_len":448,"entropy":[3.8827,8.1973,6.3243,8.3917,5.3171,5.3617,0.5843,0.8295,3.8021,6.9803,1.2685,2.4651,3.8528,4.6488,3.5021,0.8846,4.2107,6.123,1.6373,6.7345,2.4999,0.632,1.3938,7.7766,6.446,6.0631,1.9938,0.0377,4.3888,1.9484,0.0001,0.0025,4.9774,1.8289,2.1641,6.8928,1.1286,5.2088,1.359,1.0685,0.0079,2.5244,2.699,0.8561,7.0462,0.7303,1.134,5.0206,5.2772,0.6524,5.4861,1.7209,0.8961,4.5121,3.2125,5.7198,0.8116,4.2825,1.3392,4.8541,5.6977,2.0103,2.3931,1.8464,1.6101,4.7427,4.0822,2.1992,4.7955,3.7456,4.4317,2.1788,1.4705,1.0597,1.7528,0.8669,0.6179,4.6243,0.3076,1.1003,5.6258,2.1169,5.4271,4.3746,4.6959,5.2765,2.7424,2.8197,4.9256,0.3882,4.6223,0.9426,2.4731,1.7343,1.5609,2.0081,4.3213,0.1537,1.2879,5.1248,5.8334,1.0019,2.6823,4.1261,0.0487,2.0229,1.9686,2.0777,4.9593,2.215,2.6604,2.8873,1.5617,3.9149,4.1219,0.4402,2.0058,0.3474,1.3996,4.5096,1.6788,4.2007,4.9418,5.1821,0.2998,4.1688,1.1875,3.9643,3.4796,0.0112,3.3911,1.4483,4.1002,3.6855,4.3918,0.3098,0.8761,4.3146,0.7092,3.5691,1.3327,5.5931,6.1293,2.83,5.434,0.6247,1.5916,1.5198,1.8958,1.8622,3.0229,2.4891,1.9382,0.9106,4.5457,3.7977,5.9569,2.9842,2.1489,0.304,1.1841,1.1801,2.2531,5.8547,1.8101,3.481,3.2478,2.5315,2.8151,1.5522,0.1408,0.0056,5.2898,2.972,4.7549,0.9402,0.1255,4.1258,4.6119,1.2265,4.9123,2.3555,0.2309,0.0088,1.2765,1.1975,3.8148,4.8667,5.032,1.8403,2.6203,1.1698,0.4868,3.2574,0.0037,2.897,2.6394,2.1546,0.5127,0.3597,0.0222,2.4437,3.0283,2.5006,3.5327,2.1695,3.6735,0.2283,2.7292,5.5038,0.8256,5.9254,3.6136,0.0136,1.0089,2.2195,1.3885,2.7349,3.6684,2.4401,3.9171,4.4036,5.4044,1.9913,1.8667,0.627,1.1682,0.2339,5.2832,0.1033,3.9992,1.5565,5.0228,1.9255,1.8235,0.007,1.4865,2.3331,1.8745,0.5806,0.0196,1.737,0.7616,2.1246,1.8997,1.8107,0.5,3.168,0.0114,6.2304,2.4761,0.0017,1.769,7.4524,3.4121,3.4796,5.8122,2.2138,3.0798,6.9487,6.0285,0.0015,0.0018,0.0012,3.8219,0.0034,0.0008,4.1872,0.0013,3.2852,0.0032,0.0001,0.0094,4.7243,2.0439,3.196,4.0043,4.2351,5.5125,6.2033,0.6904,3.4575,3.6685,3.7764,0.906,1.2612,2.3275,5.3692,4.7984,1.2326,2.6438,4.3019,0.6385,4.5907,2.1916,0.8076,4.9354,1.6337,2.8975,0.4021,2.0066,4.079,1.2304,2.515,5.0559,0.7098,2.1764,1.9261,2.2603,2.6016,1.7788,0.4848,1.2886,1.1033,1.2454,0.2929,1.0252,1.5909,1.4855,6.0124,3.3366,1.5057,1.5171,0.2398,0.1898,0.0387,1.6385,1.2746,2.8268,1.2746,0.5928,2.432,5.5321,0.4231,1.5879,0.2518,0.6829,0.046,1.9929,1.1019,1.6906,0.4521,0.181,0.0437,0.0093,0.0509,0.0028,4.6507,1.6389,4.7074,0.1915,4.1121,1.2122,5.4266,1.4009,1.9087,5.8315,0.6691,3.9293,0.0086,0.5466,0.9897,0.011,2.3105,0.7059,3.6211,0.8592,0.0565,0.0554,0.0221,0.0048,0.0436,0.0033,1.7816,6.1805,4.5452,0.1405,1.2885,0.4067,5.7218,1.2123,4.8866,0.6438,0.07,1.9178,1.5229,3.4695,4.9626,4.6972,1.2884,1.8363,3.0921,2.9742,2.969,2.775,3.0291,4.0613,2.9216,2.5506,1.7278,0.6632,0.0217,0.7773,3.4167,2.7769,3.0147,7.1368,1.8406,3.9782,0.756,3.6606,0.4884,5.451,0.2226,1.335,1.8849,5.3886,2.9679,0.9682,0.7607,4.3059,0.2174,1.5371,2.4469,2.0218,2.243,0.2906,0.0331,4.4699,2.3762,5.4581,1.192,2.5963,5.6789,4.278,0.0001,0.0,0.0019,1.8499,0.0005,0.0021,3.842,0.0051,2.8482,0.0017,0.0002,3.196]}

{"id":4239,"ended":false,"length":415,"gen_text":"Three tough-as-nails bikers take a break at a hipster coffee shop. A gang of nerds enter and are about to confront a rivaling group. One of them comes over to the bikers saying `` You might want to leave before things get really ugly ''. One person says that they need to leave because the gang is trying to get them away because of the heat. ''I'm going to leave if it's not okay to be a punk''\n\nThis could be another sign of gang warfare between these two gang factions or simply the group's tendency to attack each other.\n\nThese are the main reasons why this is so. Because if these two were actually fighting for their lives, the fight we're talking about will end up with more violence and more mayhem.\n\nFor example:\n\nOne gang member who was with a group of friends recently told an online journalist that members of his gang were \"going after your girlfriends and wives\" (emphasis added). One person tells the newspaper that they have a \"diamond in the rough\" and that the group will go after everyone, and that someone named \"Troy\" has a hand in it.\n\nAt some point, the group might decide that Trega is a \"troglodyte\" who's just a gang member and should have his or her way (emphasis added). But when they've made up their mind, some gang members, who probably already know how to fight, may then start looking for a way to kill them.\n\nThere are a lot of possible paths that we can take but for now, we've let most of these guys live as they find their way out. While these are definitely possible, many will only become a little more aggressive when the bad guys approach.\n\nWe have a solution?\n\nThat's what our community did. It's part of our mission at the beginning of the year to have an idea what the actual danger of violent gangs is: what the right people might do to avoid them.\n\nIf those people want to fight back, I want you to share our tips on how to fight these groups when you are ready.\n\n(Image via Wikimedia Commons)","token_len":450,"entropy":[10.1097,4.2876,1.8421,0.0292,0.1409,0.0059,7.3831,2.2253,5.4127,2.4657,2.2398,3.0081,2.175,8.0921,2.4388,5.4906,0.2085,2.3074,3.4388,4.8979,0.324,8.1519,7.6786,1.7505,4.8882,4.7229,0.0136,5.5415,1.6401,5.3564,12.069,2.4253,1.8318,4.1022,0.7681,0.852,4.9549,3.3083,0.7541,1.9016,4.787,0.8225,6.8153,10.7809,9.5472,6.3702,2.2709,0.1256,4.1489,4.8123,6.0927,0.3932,3.1308,2.9246,6.9988,6.907,5.2024,5.6468,2.0498,2.9622,2.1579,3.7339,0.4158,2.2889,2.8181,2.1538,2.3529,0.8105,3.1112,0.0151,1.7794,3.2557,4.5504,6.4617,1.762,1.1653,5.4413,0.5999,5.2606,4.9559,1.6809,2.4949,0.16,2.4902,3.4494,3.1275,0.788,1.3407,5.1901,2.0315,2.6651,1.9335,4.2668,5.1163,2.4265,0.0935,3.9053,6.1099,0.8553,5.1352,3.9721,0.8219,4.9224,2.4893,4.2506,3.6368,1.021,5.3856,3.6063,5.1012,3.9824,2.1817,6.3031,0.9787,4.7005,0.251,4.9047,1.0768,0.0115,1.0298,1.772,0.0004,4.9287,2.4416,1.9063,3.9764,1.9545,0.7313,4.325,2.4431,1.8545,1.9225,5.0139,3.5488,3.1099,1.2914,6.194,4.1372,2.7542,2.9924,2.2306,0.9982,0.6671,2.7268,4.2133,7.3492,1.9923,2.3628,0.0083,4.2021,3.1852,1.1906,2.4316,3.6648,2.0542,1.7807,1.1627,4.3137,0.5753,0.8456,0.0003,4.5285,1.6995,2.7757,0.8543,0.0002,3.7937,2.8182,1.13,3.5775,2.081,4.9523,2.5452,1.3841,0.4787,3.6082,4.3802,3.4134,3.9746,3.676,3.4534,0.7726,5.4319,0.1942,1.5173,2.2004,1.4576,3.1587,3.3546,3.4458,5.5106,3.9003,1.6844,4.3578,2.1706,3.8242,4.1322,0.5919,0.6151,3.7465,3.8494,5.3186,0.95,4.6129,0.5657,3.0055,3.1342,2.5097,2.3549,5.4662,4.7299,1.2929,0.2749,0.0121,0.33,2.2669,1.0802,2.4854,1.7829,3.3693,3.4037,0.2018,4.3452,3.7093,3.3899,1.2027,5.8045,5.0619,1.957,4.2243,4.1504,0.6659,2.4771,2.3818,5.9964,0.4949,1.6252,0.3943,1.0698,0.0002,5.3922,3.2992,0.0309,0.8296,1.7058,1.562,4.4006,2.7047,1.2664,6.2104,7.1996,4.2326,1.4491,1.9192,2.8788,4.44,4.1956,0.067,0.0008,0.0962,0.7104,2.0278,3.2668,3.6569,2.0105,3.6983,0.3471,2.1475,4.5831,3.9742,2.8532,3.4165,0.0087,2.4902,3.7381,1.0051,0.0128,0.1423,4.0822,3.7188,2.2633,4.3008,3.8168,2.1713,0.1195,0.8755,0.7855,5.2225,2.9713,0.1609,4.5459,2.5027,5.173,3.8243,1.2444,2.8689,0.1858,2.2955,0.7869,3.9149,5.2127,2.9795,4.5185,0.4756,1.6473,1.0308,0.5857,3.4681,1.7706,0.6946,0.6189,0.0002,3.7927,0.9413,2.4157,1.6133,0.088,4.5485,4.9675,1.8375,4.2915,0.6446,0.2649,4.8094,3.4965,0.8203,0.8436,1.5997,3.1963,5.9405,6.5504,0.2115,1.5072,3.3578,4.4617,4.1872,1.7087,5.7082,1.1576,0.5726,3.2069,1.4251,5.9865,2.9759,2.2262,4.346,2.6542,0.5797,4.7225,4.2377,4.3623,3.5026,2.8822,2.3726,0.5083,2.971,2.6166,2.344,4.7855,0.0378,5.6738,1.1739,0.7255,0.0003,3.9355,3.2037,2.1692,5.5629,4.6978,0.9337,0.0002,4.6073,0.4523,1.5703,4.1673,3.9754,3.6314,1.2094,3.5993,1.1292,5.4342,0.048,1.6387,2.2493,4.4043,2.574,4.7537,0.3804,1.3072,0.6222,0.6334,4.4202,3.2772,4.571,3.5724,2.5022,5.5313,5.0113,1.6402,3.7449,1.8055,0.7775,5.054,3.0129,2.9546,4.8157,2.2585,3.888,0.777,1.1746,3.5083,1.996,0.4267,0.8297,0.0002,3.5087,5.8707,2.0939,3.2362,0.1982,2.8646,2.653,0.3272,4.7505,2.8272,3.0482,0.1037,4.3389,4.0045,4.1122,1.9018,0.5649,0.3983,3.0942,4.6567,2.637,6.0709,1.373,3.0696,3.4455,0.6827,0.9476,0.0002,5.2247,3.5263,1.7781,3.7837,0.0851,0.3007]}
{"id":936,"ended":false,"length":409,"gen_text":"Attempting to disprove the flat earth theory, a man sails for months only to reach the edge of Earth.\n\nHowever, that is exactly what is happening in the solar system.\n\nThe fact is that with all its massive cosmic forces, the sun has a very short life span. The Earth is actually about 70 million years old, and is already over 7 billion years old.\n\nThe Earth is actually about 7 billion years old, and is about 10 billion years old.\n\nThe solar system has actually been expanding for about 100 million years. The Sun has so far only been more than 200 million years old; we would need to reach it in less than 10,000 years. A few millennia later, our Sun will have doubled our solar distance to the point where it would be the smallest planet on the planet's surface.\n\nThis solar expansion will continue during the next 600 million years, allowing us to get close to Neptune and possibly find a new home beyond Earth.\n\nHowever, some of the other cosmic forces are getting more urgent, as we get closer to our nearest neighbour, so we will need to try to stop them from moving.\n\nWe already know that there exists massive black holes where the Sun will be even smaller than our star. The Sun will still be in the distance to our nearest star, so our sun will be just around the edges of this universe. This is the reason we are seeing the sun at such a rapid rate.\n\nIn fact as you can see below, that is just the first step to breaking out of this tiny little hole in our solar system.\n\nNote that, by only using the term \"stellar expansion\", our scientists are completely unaware of the enormous distance between our Sun and Earth, which is at least a few thousand miles across!\n\nIn this sense, the fact that our planet is so far out of time is just one aspect of the incredible history of the solar system.\n\nI am so excited about this article!

{"id":1414,"ended":true,"length":445,"gen_text":"Money does buy happiness, and if one doesn't need happiness to live, then one can't really need happiness because people have money. If you spend too much money and want to keep that money in your bank account, then everything gets robbed.\n\nEven though there really is no right or wrong way to spend and when it comes to getting happiness, it is very clear that it's very difficult for the human species to find happiness in the universe. We have all evolved to be free from selfish behavior and we can live a very, very happy planet on a peaceful planet where we are completely free with no harm to anyone or anything whatsoever. If your love life doesn't make you happy, then it's a waste of our free time trying to find happiness. Therefore, it can be very difficult for us to find and value happiness because we're stuck, and there's so much we can do to get our happiness, so some of the positive things we can do to get our happiness are things like being able to live a happy life and not have a hard time with that too.\n\nWe do need to use happiness as a good counterbalance to selfishness because we're all selfish. The sad point is that in the beginning, there were no positive reasons for what we were supposed to do without doing what God intended for us. There wasn't any evil for us to do in God because we could never live as they had promised. God gave us hope, but it wasn't enough. By making our happiness less important to ourselves, it kept us from wanting happiness and also the more important happiness, you're losing your happiness in this world.\n\nNow my hope is that God is in the right ways in your decision as to what to do with happiness. If you are living a very different relationship with God than with money, you will not be happy. The only thing that makes happiness more attractive is your happiness. If you put money, love, or life into your happiness, then you will want to love yourself more until you see how much happiness you can achieve with it. The very same thing will happen if you put money into the value you're trying to have. The more happy you are, the more your life will be.","token_len":453,"entropy":[7.2541,7.5537,10.0385,1.516,2.1679,3.7028,4.9166,3.7542,0.0006,5.285,2.4331,2.3815,2.0898,0.7612,1.3486,2.2155,2.4188,2.0989,3.5782,5.0682,1.2309,4.1563,4.2022,2.932,4.8768,1.1435,3.106,1.1271,4.7858,3.2457,0.0404,0.7935,2.4507,3.1948,0.5121,3.9898,3.2831,0.3488,3.549,0.5089,1.4685,0.0465,0.2456,0.9768,6.5282,3.9033,5.4775,0.7149,1.0675,0.0052,5.3576,2.2173,2.7465,6.6764,1.0581,0.7965,5.277,1.0587,0.0281,0.6093,0.1891,1.1699,6.1327,5.4223,2.2651,0.3069,0.0379,4.5773,0.894,0.3192,2.1208,1.4313,3.2371,3.7937,0.4025,2.6971,2.3485,3.6853,1.9744,1.9945,2.9792,3.2122,3.7625,0.1122,3.5985,0.8274,2.0845,1.7203,5.0996,0.5672,2.9569,2.3072,3.4193,4.2563,1.0005,1.3766,5.0824,1.2449,5.3058,4.0767,1.1548,2.282,2.5681,3.4477,3.0161,2.3232,3.4458,0.0084,1.0037,8.0106,4.9083,1.5306,5.3499,0.5148,3.6839,1.3509,2.311,4.5061,0.7876,6.9649,1.5413,4.0802,1.6028,2.7929,2.7674,0.9251,3.8529,0.1948,3.0409,4.8652,5.5405,2.5168,3.7278,0.0004,3.1565,0.197,0.2648,0.4078,0.6136,2.0287,1.1448,3.3076,2.3757,0.1722,4.3912,4.6847,0.2474,5.6603,0.0473,1.5902,0.5751,0.9481,6.4976,0.3413,2.153,5.0558,0.4387,0.8377,0.8376,0.862,1.3415,0.1306,0.4737,5.6125,4.5709,0.1721,2.7532,1.4012,2.6767,3.8983,5.2981,2.4223,3.8868,1.1445,3.5843,0.1362,2.7508,0.3997,0.414,0.5999,2.3298,3.0285,1.1966,2.2749,2.7319,6.2313,0.911,1.5607,5.7155,0.8372,0.9028,0.4331,0.1294,1.0951,0.7464,1.4573,0.0945,0.6885,3.9202,0.4462,3.7817,1.4142,0.0018,3.3268,1.6006,1.9794,0.2239,1.8601,2.4683,2.5137,2.9774,3.2155,0.2278,2.7335,3.3424,5.7009,0.2772,0.5354,0.0001,3.9716,4.1996,2.4072,0.6777,5.4248,3.5819,1.119,0.4882,5.2176,5.6265,0.6246,0.4066,3.4777,0.4356,2.8269,1.8729,1.8243,2.7605,2.1325,1.249,3.3251,5.6703,6.5665,0.732,0.2808,4.1457,1.7028,3.3378,1.206,2.725,1.3997,2.6764,3.5839,4.2851,1.0447,5.0432,0.5769,1.6324,6.3458,0.0009,0.441,6.4661,3.7641,3.7295,7.3891,2.8007,2.5192,0.0399,0.8456,3.3574,4.269,0.0002,1.723,5.4544,4.2483,0.9797,0.4218,0.1536,3.4317,3.5484,4.9095,1.4873,4.2425,3.3402,3.8847,3.7886,5.6651,3.3481,3.5375,1.9899,3.4125,3.0203,0.1873,4.1001,1.7932,2.0373,2.6366,1.5242,0.0002,2.4213,1.3569,6.216,4.0416,2.3787,2.6814,4.5936,2.3888,2.0134,2.2102,0.655,3.4829,5.1607,0.8957,0.8039,4.1606,3.1813,2.0628,4.9363,5.1739,3.6239,1.9306,4.3807,2.5004,6.3646,3.9616,5.3499,2.0416,2.8829,2.9232,3.9041,1.1956,0.4696,0.8666,0.0001,3.8971,6.4385,3.5286,0.1851,0.1949,3.1669,2.5246,4.3968,1.8487,0.8169,6.8806,2.9324,5.5469,4.813,3.718,0.3901,0.8868,1.6867,0.1268,0.4653,2.6228,0.794,2.373,0.6984,3.0419,4.821,1.3114,2.9342,6.0436,6.0849,1.4136,0.9688,1.3967,3.9757,5.7844,0.424,2.1859,2.2825,3.5905,1.2047,0.9669,1.28,3.4502,1.9802,1.9625,1.1336,3.0487,4.0339,1.8983,6.4167,1.0771,2.6943,3.0972,0.8124,1.6651,0.4386,5.3273,1.2919,4.5507,3.3423,0.5006,2.3441,3.9826,0.7132,1.5528,3.3831,0.4257,0.7111,0.9302,0.9294,4.6848,0.5618,3.8309,3.13,0.7258,7.7158,0.5976,4.2866,2.5006,0.9084,1.8556,0.5804,1.2983,2.1261,1.7894,2.0055,0.1638,3.7179,5.2519,2.8747,0.9521,1.9247,1.3967,1.3395,0.1493,1.4251,0.7327,0.4957,3.2932,6.4514,2.5148,2.7331,1.9146,0.015,4.3203,1.2867,3.0785,2.5683,4.8628,0.2232,0.3751,0.793,0.0435,0.3198,3.4992,2.4416,0.3502,0.8351,1.4383]}

is our first evidence that brain cells use electrical communication signals to communicate ideas, and we believe this results in new directions in medicine.\n\n\"It is believed that living beings rely on information such as this to survive during the physical world.\"\n\nThey found that the difference in synaptic number in the amygdala between humans and animals showed some relevance to the relationship between their experiences relating to pain and emotion\n\nBut they said the studies did not provide any data about the differences between the human brain and elephants because the information only showed that elephants were more sensitive to pain and their emotional state was the same as that of elephants.\n\nProfessor Peter Wozman, Lecturer in Neuroscience at Stirling University said as they had investigated how human brain cells communicate, it would be difficult to know whether such communication is affected by the differences in brain size between human groups.\n\nThe team found that people on average had fewer cells in the hippocampus compared with people at the other end of the brain in comparison to elephants or humans.\n\nAccording to the study, the difference in hippocampal volume between different humans is about the same in the brain area over which the two brains share cells.\n\nIt said these data show that the different areas of activity related to pain are thought to be regulated by the different brain networks.\n\nProfessor Wozman admitted that the researchers did not completely explain the relationship between hippocampal volume and pleasure, but stressed that as part of the study they tried to understand how brain activity influenced pleasure.","token_len":453,"entropy":[9.923,6.4689,6.1041,9.242,7.6547,1.4947,3.2591,11.6746,2.3381,0.0051,2.8464,3.7351,3.2894,4.3236,4.0156,2.3334,3.1001,1.1109,1.6681,1.5836,0.1963,1.0963,3.2422,3.6996,2.6713,0.722,5.5119,6.208,3.3607,0.0005,0.4302,2.7876,3.9208,2.7851,0.3306,3.9518,3.8272,2.7763,1.0109,4.8052,2.111,2.7122,5.9132,2.0004,1.6179,3.2833,1.2228,2.3879,0.0004,0.1513,5.3167,2.6128,5.1582,4.2506,2.4024,6.0133,5.184,3.3343,4.214,1.3366,7.1724,1.5478,0.6259,0.0611,4.6723,2.0396,4.4186,3.0989,0.776,3.5873,0.4103,2.5632,0.63,0.0003,0.1221,3.6721,1.3492,1.9439,5.5774,6.0388,0.5927,3.354,2.2685,1.4532,2.9273,0.7841,3.3502,2.2269,1.0941,0.7166,0.0002,0.094,2.5702,4.8545,2.7938,2.1847,3.9703,3.5153,3.3929,1.0992,2.2681,0.9941,4.1971,1.3053,2.1843,2.1208,0.0423,0.8489,4.8545,1.4958,1.4122,0.1554,0.0002,0.0999,4.2753,0.7545,0.1206,5.2792,4.3792,0.1112,2.1727,3.4657,1.737,0.0071,2.6838,6.2626,1.0095,1.8924,3.1055,0.5168,0.2871,4.2062,1.0643,0.7136,4.1297,0.0176,3.772,3.6533,1.7715,5.0012,0.2448,1.7927,1.4123,1.9189,1.6425,0.0003,0.0551,2.6856,2.3979,5.714,0.5009,4.3139,0.4615,3.4243,0.6977,5.6122,3.6339,6.3434,4.0172,0.6893,1.0198,5.967,2.3373,2.0777,2.102,3.0333,1.393,5.6531,0.3201,2.7246,5.8343,0.801,1.8237,1.3841,0.0989,0.0002,0.0577,2.8867,1.0136,5.1946,0.1511,5.9277,1.8899,5.1634,0.1595,3.3,4.6095,0.0093,1.4722,0.7393,4.5995,6.8092,2.3597,4.858,1.6274,3.8096,0.6757,0.0003,4.6631,4.2103,0.3802,1.4731,5.6779,1.0585,6.3233,5.5342,2.823,0.6777,5.5868,2.6625,2.4383,0.0726,0.3761,3.6355,4.9038,5.0649,0.7135,1.4292,5.1033,0.0534,4.4491,4.3148,7.7457,0.0543,3.7213,0.4373,4.8079,1.9804,0.0002,4.4774,2.0157,2.4533,1.7188,6.0611,2.7913,0.0678,2.9602,2.1501,3.8601,1.8562,1.3436,3.9522,0.8432,1.0294,2.3711,0.6682,0.1117,7.3112,4.3627,1.6702,4.8744,4.8528,3.1163,2.3853,1.116,2.0024,1.3322,1.6388,0.2236,0.5919,1.9351,4.3583,3.8266,2.316,2.0408,4.3459,0.3439,1.4056,1.2652,0.152,1.6622,0.3034,0.1328,0.0003,3.4341,4.1213,4.6528,5.1133,5.469,0.5405,6.6736,0.0097,0.3648,1.0856,0.5722,4.9976,2.8474,0.0812,2.6137,8.9939,3.1419,3.113,5.4619,2.4999,4.2141,1.7969,0.5093,2.2389,1.3943,1.6404,1.9818,0.3878,3.3899,0.1346,2.4205,1.7249,4.4736,3.2345,2.6938,4.9417,0.0767,1.6735,3.7962,0.8855,2.0792,1.4798,1.2546,3.7563,6.0612,0.2379,0.0758,0.0002,3.2877,2.6373,2.9795,0.2384,4.9142,4.976,0.3528,1.1714,3.6525,3.9866,0.3546,0.6973,2.5404,2.2305,1.3979,1.8916,5.699,0.9316,1.4944,0.1854,0.0403,0.0574,1.287,3.7172,0.9331,0.3792,1.1278,4.3364,1.5579,0.4249,0.2226,0.0002,6.3872,0.0058,1.2847,1.8525,0.4228,1.2758,2.0483,0.7929,3.0891,0.0137,1.9029,0.8239,4.8359,4.2961,2.9793,3.053,2.3934,0.037,2.4232,2.7815,3.2958,5.554,6.0361,1.3668,1.4455,3.2951,2.4481,1.7559,4.4493,0.6129,0.1733,0.0002,3.0307,3.1132,3.871,2.3414,4.1756,0.3231,1.5457,3.4955,4.6522,0.432,7.6742,5.9496,0.047,1.2636,2.1547,5.7274,0.021,0.8638,5.293,0.1971,1.4742,2.5163,1.8372,4.4531,1.0473,0.1608,0.0002,1.3255,0.7019,0.0007,0.0026,7.1028,0.644,1.3983,3.411,2.4282,0.0734,4.7651,3.4371,1.0391,4.7496,0.1538,5.8835,0.0042,0.3935,0.2988,5.2801,1.7394,0.4326,4.4213,0.2097,5.6315,4.8569,0.0018,1.2086,1.3478,1.1982,5.6743,0.0576,2.1207,1.1036,3.9718,3.4161,4.6629,2.3057,0.7867]}

{"id":395,"ended":true,"length":426,"gen_text":"A group of fantasy characters finding themselves in the ruins of modern Earth... and one that has found itself in the ruins of many other places.\"\n\nThe characters of The Twilight Zone have been cast in various roles over the years. Matt Rogen, the new character of The Lord of the Rings, is the original voice of Mordor, the villain who had been the strongest character ever designed in the first place. He's still very much human and human-focused but he's now much more human than he was in the first two movies, with more than one of his favorite characters being voiced on TV for years after the first movie, with a cameo by Frank Darabont for one of those later appearances. As a result, Rogen's role has become one of the more successful ones in the Marvel universe, but it's really the opposite, as the franchise has evolved from one reboot to another to an ever more vibrant and varied franchise, with many new things being said and done about it.\n\nRogen's not in any of the Star Wars movies so he's not in any of the first Transformers movies. But his voice is still very much familiar, especially in the second one, which came out in 2011, and I feel like he's right at the start of what will prove to be his most interesting story arc in the Marvel Universe so far. That's really the key.\n\nRing!\n\nHere's a more recent video that is dedicated entirely to Ring Rong, the voice for R-E-W-S, the very first book in the series, and a look at a bunch of other roles that were in effect in this part of the comic at the time. It's all in very short order, so I thought I would highlight what is, in fact, another great take on this story arc that will take the reader on a journey through what it's like being a young orphan in the '70s.\n\nHere's Ring Rong, who makes an appearance in the story arc, right here:\n\nIf you dig Ring Rong and you feel like you have a lot of things to say about him in this part, feel free to submit your thoughts via The Discourse and leave your favorite questions below.","token_len":457,"entropy":[7.1549,0.3239,10.9762,5.1746,10.3434,0.7384,1.0043,1.6052,6.6792,0.039,7.2263,6.6007,5.5849,3.2221,4.5893,1.7281,2.6836,4.8693,1.8565,1.4178,1.3017,2.8915,0.1799,5.4411,1.5481,2.7163,4.5157,0.6152,0.0039,2.4987,5.4702,2.0208,2.6166,4.7306,0.7359,2.6627,1.5323,4.6831,0.8539,2.8444,0.9449,1.7572,0.0217,0.4666,1.5364,6.0245,6.1728,4.3861,1.5439,2.9535,5.4793,4.2332,2.6966,1.9111,5.2876,0.0472,0.0422,0.0039,0.7882,1.7954,1.8426,4.8765,3.0025,0.3714,5.7329,0.0178,0.8707,1.7472,4.3259,2.1764,4.6896,1.5656,3.2564,5.8922,2.6518,3.2234,6.2029,2.9681,0.7613,2.5621,0.7082,0.3119,3.1996,2.2987,5.3953,4.5185,0.0251,6.2518,2.3902,4.8675,1.6883,4.6378,4.4069,1.8705,0.7206,3.6716,4.0584,0.2754,2.9522,2.2316,0.9417,0.4601,1.313,0.5161,0.7715,2.279,1.9169,1.7793,3.3409,3.3262,2.9337,2.879,3.6301,1.0034,4.5083,1.8909,2.1874,3.8348,4.4076,5.3193,5.0912,3.5856,2.7871,1.0002,1.8637,1.4737,3.1205,4.1096,2.9351,4.1376,2.022,5.6852,2.3705,0.0,0.0003,4.3505,4.2576,0.4896,3.1433,5.1639,3.6271,0.246,4.6944,2.4009,0.7864,0.3918,2.4163,0.0007,1.7201,2.6331,1.9421,2.1435,2.7277,0.079,0.217,2.4348,4.8519,3.2876,1.5844,0.7874,4.6616,2.8937,0.984,3.7574,2.0047,0.6194,5.4101,2.9582,5.834,2.9673,1.5298,2.0631,5.5034,0.5901,3.7064,1.9465,2.439,6.109,0.8148,0.5428,3.949,4.757,3.1305,2.2628,5.4995,1.3472,2.4088,2.7955,2.2835,1.5358,2.7311,2.8213,5.9232,2.1818,6.1206,1.2482,0.22,2.9163,1.5466,0.8879,0.6571,0.0002,3.4428,0.0076,1.2479,5.6067,5.3999,1.9212,0.9099,0.959,4.9302,0.3899,0.6904,4.5023,2.0905,0.9063,1.0624,2.2553,1.0099,0.178,0.2418,4.4693,5.8854,0.4755,1.6851,1.8749,3.128,2.7929,1.1304,1.7238,2.0593,0.2207,6.0244,1.6264,3.8128,1.8125,0.6876,4.1564,3.0967,0.8283,2.1695,4.222,0.1777,0.7247,3.1338,1.2977,1.0073,4.1954,4.1959,0.7614,1.9795,0.7433,5.3024,1.663,0.2691,4.0738,0.3861,2.914,2.943,6.465,0.0647,0.0046,2.9214,1.7378,3.5606,3.5623,1.9526,2.1077,1.351,2.7494,1.7114,2.9588,0.0006,0.2567,4.6114,1.3628,4.328,1.5752,3.7227,3.0787,1.0463,0.0001,10.3163,4.9948,1.3708,0.0002,5.1926,0.2631,1.2872,4.7544,2.6826,3.2599,2.7465,4.1084,5.3037,3.3817,0.0046,2.69,6.0157,3.2873,1.3134,1.6047,4.198,4.0139,3.9055,5.3016,3.3103,0.1009,4.1368,0.06,1.4866,1.9363,1.5382,5.8501,1.3555,5.7965,0.3005,0.4612,2.2447,1.8541,1.7682,2.5532,5.0653,0.2784,3.6124,4.7252,0.0315,1.0611,4.9262,1.2121,2.7032,3.5139,6.4559,1.6227,4.2505,5.7065,0.1815,0.096,3.4973,6.0221,0.1881,0.0846,0.4337,2.6673,0.418,4.1116,2.8833,5.1047,2.4808,1.1277,0.7495,1.5032,2.4394,4.7708,0.7971,2.915,4.218,4.1093,3.8085,4.6457,1.543,1.7241,0.0163,5.7435,2.4555,5.3413,0.0472,2.6888,2.8059,2.3541,2.2391,2.6293,3.8419,2.7615,1.9821,1.6926,0.4356,0.8428,1.5104,4.9716,2.054,1.1652,0.1022,3.8123,1.2194,2.6618,5.0015,1.3621,1.1422,4.9781,1.7059,0.0388,1.4365,0.4423,0.0002,3.9255,0.2984,3.2211,0.5564,0.005,1.9604,2.7523,5.3923,3.0876,0.1666,0.3743,1.1047,4.2306,2.7763,2.0822,4.6433,2.4699,1.3835,0.2835,0.0002,4.7547,0.203,6.0242,2.418,0.3539,0.0027,2.6485,1.8676,5.292,0.3016,0.8581,2.7242,1.6829,2.1497,0.4633,4.1388,0.7787,1.0657,0.6687,1.9711,2.2697,0.5528,3.1595,1.223,3.6054,0.0009,0.0153,5.8541,0.6803,0.6542,4.5286,5.1176,6.6598,0.9929,3.7453,3.6506,1.9013,5.3844,4.69,2.9347,0.5381]}

We agreed to work together as a team and he came back with another agent.\"\n\nHe said that after talking to Fischla, the team is ready to bring on another agent, and that he wanted to talk to another agent but he was told that there won't be an agreement. On the other hand, he said, the agents agreed he had to wait but said it was hard to tell, with Fischla having said that his desire is to stay at Michigan.\n\nFischla asked that his word to stay with the agent be withdrawn but Fischla told him it would make the situation easier and that he would give up. As part of his solution, however, Fischla asked Fischla to leave his job at Ford Motor Company and he said that the manager told him he should be on the outside.\n\nFord said that the relationship began when Fischla and his co-workers were hired to work in Detroit in 2002 to serve the Michigan chapter of the anti-war group Unite the Right, which then moved its offices.\n\nNow, after 20 years as an attorney at Ford, Fischla said he could not remember exactly what had happened because he could never remember what they had told others. The case against Fischla and two others at Ford and West Virginia were settled without appeal; it comes after years of negotiations and a legal battle over whether Fischla and their firm had been \"underwritten\" at U.S. Bank in their dealings with him in Afghanistan.\n\nAccording to Fischla's attorney, Joseph Seagre, the firm was part of the group that was involved in the case during the litigation. His client's lawyer said he knows of no other evidence pointing to an agreement for Fischla to stay at the firm at Ford or not.\n\n\"There's absolutely no question that there was no agreement signed by any of them,\" Seagre said in a telephone interview Wednesday. But he added: \"We just want to continue to work with Fischla for another 2 years.\"","token_len":458,"entropy":[4.2507,5.311,4.8758,7.6126,2.0463,4.5584,0.0005,3.192,3.662,2.5292,4.1652,2.6957,5.3281,2.2383,1.497,0.285,3.5256,0.001,1.5389,1.5353,0.6387,6.4804,0.9739,4.9429,5.6717,3.2521,3.119,1.6208,2.9476,2.6148,0.8081,3.3971,2.4049,0.8765,2.806,1.4872,2.0097,3.6995,0.8699,3.3804,0.5691,3.9989,0.6842,0.2561,1.7301,2.3586,2.3626,0.213,2.3208,4.265,5.8696,4.1588,0.2909,0.0006,3.3992,1.7673,2.0265,2.867,5.2532,0.6139,6.2439,5.2438,6.0848,1.137,2.4431,3.1872,5.2218,2.7651,0.2563,3.8592,4.7736,1.753,0.8176,2.1907,2.6826,1.4323,1.91,5.4107,0.4372,3.3127,0.412,4.5535,0.79,5.3392,2.8417,1.7329,1.4304,1.1081,3.051,5.6843,0.0001,0.0049,2.8742,1.718,1.1046,6.2978,1.6933,0.919,0.0338,0.0308,1.2907,0.4056,0.6559,1.9849,3.9013,3.7694,5.7362,3.0083,0.8895,4.2947,5.8307,3.5622,3.2157,1.2105,5.6268,0.583,3.2052,4.1117,5.1923,2.883,0.0025,0.0028,3.148,3.8053,1.4107,3.7165,5.5265,2.3151,0.4369,2.97,3.2356,5.2189,1.2709,0.2771,0.0002,2.4046,0.0213,0.0067,6.6157,2.3875,1.5624,5.8739,2.8425,2.7228,1.5438,0.795,3.8317,1.2848,5.4743,3.1529,2.9603,0.0055,0.0079,3.2476,0.2239,2.682,2.1008,4.5496,2.4461,1.5256,2.7512,2.9142,1.3269,0.7777,1.3196,4.4209,2.0881,1.9389,5.2198,4.2615,0.0015,1.6481,5.4748,0.2735,5.9084,0.0025,1.0614,0.0015,0.0103,2.5775,2.4169,0.0154,0.0158,0.3777,2.7841,2.7443,2.4111,2.0486,4.2692,1.1327,1.0943,1.5503,3.064,2.0698,1.5526,3.4925,4.9605,2.6001,0.0303,1.4758,2.9051,3.5492,4.2582,1.1722,3.8573,2.5564,0.8423,0.0002,4.6817,2.9533,1.0929,2.5674,5.3728,5.2472,1.7198,0.7395,0.0011,0.0072,3.3929,1.3551,4.5236,0.0178,0.4294,2.02,3.3361,2.0108,1.3759,2.2178,3.2507,1.9793,3.0239,4.0621,5.2233,2.943,4.2239,4.2262,0.0422,0.4163,6.1412,0.0052,2.2717,0.7761,5.0995,0.2679,0.2366,0.0017,1.888,1.0629,5.5513,4.1239,2.8184,3.3718,2.7166,1.3511,0.0002,6.1014,0.784,3.2417,4.9439,0.0725,2.5855,1.6689,2.6628,3.012,1.8646,0.5341,0.3609,0.0008,0.0115,1.4337,0.9335,5.5064,0.7897,3.8216,3.9136,1.1338,2.9687,0.4134,4.853,0.7213,3.74,4.4491,1.3944,1.5646,4.455,0.884,3.6662,6.1584,0.9274,3.5308,4.6235,2.2132,1.7686,0.0052,0.006,2.8813,4.9144,1.589,4.6362,0.712,4.1702,6.1622,4.0324,3.7352,1.6562,4.7902,5.2422,6.2569,4.2761,7.0222,1.5478,3.3187,0.0639,3.691,1.8879,2.8276,3.7891,0.5715,2.2507,2.7184,2.7484,0.0048,0.0077,2.73,5.4527,4.8339,3.1627,2.6882,5.0209,5.2918,3.4871,0.5675,6.091,7.2683,0.2335,0.0182,0.0331,1.5438,3.2088,4.9435,1.8038,0.1823,6.3349,3.7645,3.6256,0.2353,0.3806,0.0002,4.5456,0.0052,1.881,0.008,0.0136,1.5989,2.1801,0.2835,5.4402,6.276,4.6749,4.4115,0.2086,1.1553,4.3648,2.4099,4.4648,0.031,1.4734,3.106,0.8498,3.0851,2.7469,0.2017,0.7977,3.1463,6.0164,0.5366,4.7955,0.805,4.9419,0.483,2.9799,2.2641,2.6667,2.1378,5.0336,1.3293,0.2023,1.309,5.0485,5.252,0.1516,3.5671,1.3072,4.3533,0.8694,0.0017,0.009,0.5363,0.878,0.9089,1.1437,1.4673,4.7023,2.4891,1.9783,7.3113,0.4608,0.3888,0.0002,1.7982,3.0754,1.7644,4.1914,0.376,3.7498,0.7591,2.3862,0.4272,2.7149,1.0817,6.1282,1.7135,2.3076,0.6354,3.0388,0.9214,0.3379,0.0017,0.0022,0.1421,3.3355,1.6108,0.5788,0.0112,3.9954,0.2703,5.2403,0.8135,1.0216,3.0162,0.0463,2.0778,4.6735,3.2471,0.359,4.9071,0.7036,1.318,0.7092,4.0652,0.0048,0.0078,4.7247,4.2728,5.332,1.5741,1.4514]}

{"id":4382,"ended":true,"length":418,"gen_text":"Write a scene to an accompanying song, and play it in your library.\n\nHere's an example of how to add sound in a play:\n\n# Play an interesting song to a new play that's currently playing.\n\nThis example displays the sound field that is displayed on the Playfield of the music box. If the player is active, this will show a list of all existing tracks. If the player is off, but no album or new track has been played, it will show the music box with the default music.\n\nCreating a Scene\n\nIn this way, you can create a completely new sound field\u2014it's just one more field.\n\nNow that the sound field can be created, you can create your own simple interface.\n\nThis can be used to make your sound field work and is generally what will get it done, but there's a problem with the interface: you have to keep some of the key elements of a sound field. If you want a sound field with which to compose your music, you have to set a few variables based on type:\n\ndata (type=data, size=16, sort_by=array, play:string);\n\nNow, with the interface there's no need for changing anything. It just has to be changed once and for all.\n\nConclusion\n\nI always had a desire to start making a little more interfaces as they become more important. The interface will help me get to a place where I can use more of their functionality without worrying that if it doesn't work for me the application is going to fail. When looking at this tutorial I feel that I must say that a little more thinking in the interface means that I can do something that my apps do, where any apps that are not working won't make them so.\n\nHopefully I've answered what you're wondering about. There are lots of excellent blog posts on this topic, some good examples, tips, and tips for creating good sound effects and some great tutorials.\n\nIf you're trying something out, don't hesitate to leave a comment or ask me anything.\n\nCheers,\n\nThe author!\n\nThis article was written by Dave Bader and first appeared in The Sound Of Music.","token_len":462,"entropy":[4.0641,7.5227,2.9234,4.7676,9.8061,6.8469,2.1204,1.888,3.7501,1.072,2.3844,2.0044,5.0827,0.7486,1.278,0.0015,5.3622,0.7041,1.724,0.1983,0.8095,1.7591,0.6999,3.5773,5.9541,4.0743,1.5307,6.2412,2.149,0.1498,0.0002,2.9925,4.8927,3.1855,5.2038,1.2966,2.9916,1.1908,4.4394,3.9842,5.1119,2.636,4.2977,0.3257,1.2307,2.948,0.0002,4.4202,2.1916,5.2108,1.0777,3.5043,5.7366,3.9118,2.4044,3.2442,1.9231,0.4086,4.4808,4.0282,5.5672,0.7514,4.6822,4.4429,0.83,3.8689,1.5998,3.4596,1.3275,5.0051,0.4909,3.056,2.6843,2.0513,2.2317,3.2829,0.0247,1.3814,4.7404,2.9741,1.3426,2.4647,0.5858,0.3233,0.1048,2.4278,0.1089,6.5835,4.2591,6.4967,3.7999,5.4803,2.3415,1.9908,0.1231,1.8414,0.3155,2.7706,0.2639,1.1723,1.5692,4.216,0.5535,2.26,1.3967,5.3847,3.5866,2.1478,0.7362,0.0001,5.5999,0.8433,4.2056,0.5883,0.0001,3.4269,1.9587,6.2527,0.2048,0.8421,0.2686,0.8129,0.8151,5.9584,0.747,2.4658,1.086,6.0638,4.3788,1.0968,1.6873,3.1094,2.6145,4.873,2.2157,1.2575,0.0001,4.2342,1.5276,2.6506,1.9142,0.179,4.3138,0.1386,1.9551,0.3561,1.1168,0.2517,1.842,2.1788,0.2639,6.0951,5.5898,1.5704,1.1969,0.0001,4.1663,3.6145,0.2203,2.7728,0.5453,3.9641,2.076,2.3205,0.8779,3.593,4.8116,4.5477,5.3976,4.4403,4.469,2.9423,3.7917,1.9439,3.285,0.9903,2.5866,1.9654,1.0265,4.627,1.3599,3.4562,3.6277,1.8871,2.3262,1.7648,0.0804,4.395,5.5219,1.9723,0.4715,5.2453,2.4994,1.3273,3.1704,0.7261,0.0891,2.362,3.3067,0.3546,2.1751,2.9864,2.3928,0.5203,2.6904,5.6895,1.1055,5.6309,2.4192,1.8723,0.2169,0.4981,1.0148,0.0098,5.058,2.2263,2.9312,3.9852,6.7602,0.032,6.0389,2.0636,0.3365,0.0001,5.7725,4.1504,4.1554,4.1713,4.862,0.8213,4.6198,0.1012,4.6101,0.9578,5.6334,4.2828,1.5946,0.0824,5.6558,0.8386,5.3594,6.2228,2.0829,4.0225,0.301,0.0002,4.3102,1.0482,5.1715,1.9268,1.8221,6.2213,0.8473,1.1046,0.9637,2.2714,4.562,2.712,1.4817,2.8266,1.9498,3.2608,0.2734,0.5613,3.6419,3.7235,3.0018,3.6832,0.0012,0.4497,0.4237,0.0001,5.6108,0.06,0.0001,3.3415,5.9013,4.4026,0.8931,3.5921,0.1029,5.2678,3.0609,3.0514,4.2403,2.2219,4.7986,5.0481,3.8307,1.5875,0.7543,3.9093,0.6725,3.0111,2.8495,4.6515,2.8145,1.8775,3.0989,2.8325,2.4933,1.8477,0.0706,0.2034,0.5601,3.5484,3.4448,1.5741,4.2527,1.7127,2.1741,2.6499,3.4613,5.9086,3.4444,1.3894,0.0004,0.3612,2.1026,0.2608,5.1379,6.3587,2.655,1.3925,0.0522,1.8428,0.3241,4.9813,5.7753,0.6437,3.4767,4.1374,1.8255,4.4655,1.5486,1.5232,6.1817,2.8583,0.4596,4.7866,2.3289,2.0083,5.5272,4.2011,1.4289,1.7047,4.54,0.8056,0.7855,1.1052,3.2534,2.7751,2.1783,4.6995,5.6093,3.7448,3.4271,5.8443,6.0144,5.6451,1.5751,2.3922,2.0047,3.2483,5.3074,0.0015,4.9063,5.1671,5.4506,1.3533,0.7804,0.0003,4.8256,3.2229,0.3755,5.2562,5.0296,0.6883,1.5012,3.0929,1.1805,1.9054,3.8807,0.7656,3.139,0.2239,5.3379,5.782,0.1886,1.7156,1.78,0.4444,1.0996,4.7028,4.6446,2.4864,2.5801,5.6095,0.6902,0.5952,3.6121,1.7609,2.697,3.9439,2.1194,2.0062,1.7702,3.9864,2.4673,1.6544,1.0816,1.2846,0.0002,1.6916,0.0773,2.1037,5.1584,2.7937,1.1316,1.0266,3.6221,0.0002,0.7752,0.0096,1.8945,0.321,0.1698,1.9167,2.4682,1.7379,1.993,1.2207,1.6157,0.0002,4.5433,0.0023,0.9146,0.1298,0.0002,4.6262,2.9178,3.0094,0.7897,0.0002,3.7849,1.6123,0.9002,1.1316,0.2085,5.5574,4.4125,5.4543,1.943,5.6524,0.279,1.2523,2.5709,2.7337,4.0816,1.8052,1.5801]}

They even provide fake video evidence to further their agenda that they hope will convince us to support their murderous agenda and use this in their propaganda.\n\nMore Videos Here, click here to the video below:\n\nThe article above makes this very clear but if I must say I am not a complete debunker I would strongly suggest I visit the following pages:\n\n\nhttp:\/\/www.thefreepress.com\/articles\/history\/1925_wtf.htm\n\nhttp:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.co.uk\/the-story-of-malfunctions_n_14782325.html\n\nAdvertisements","token_len":464,"entropy":[3.8828,2.7333,7.9675,2.9229,11.9274,12.0489,1.0498,3.3461,4.9949,7.5585,1.516,7.7036,0.4032,6.5844,1.1853,0.5692,4.7392,6.0779,4.7088,2.5048,2.6266,7.1195,0.0008,1.0539,1.8425,3.2598,3.4312,3.7223,0.475,3.591,2.9126,2.6342,5.0371,1.5548,10.7954,2.6623,6.2134,1.3122,7.3522,1.9426,0.0377,2.0467,2.7423,3.3855,0.0004,3.1605,3.9854,4.9353,0.197,7.7285,5.2083,0.4409,7.1921,0.452,1.5984,0.011,5.6647,4.4057,2.358,4.1506,0.5068,1.5016,4.5958,5.4958,0.0378,5.1708,5.4551,1.1314,4.5346,2.6652,6.5799,1.613,3.4875,3.9622,4.2716,2.0998,4.7712,4.5673,2.7856,0.6151,4.5748,2.0963,2.8586,2.5523,5.7354,3.9496,3.4051,0.8433,3.9742,5.1643,1.1572,4.191,0.7213,1.4031,0.0001,3.964,0.0015,1.6732,3.9518,2.9846,3.1232,0.3606,2.8616,1.2995,2.2744,5.1008,0.8561,0.6786,2.339,0.0002,4.8879,2.3814,1.7259,4.1222,0.2621,4.4525,6.1061,4.263,3.7796,1.7429,3.1427,2.6323,2.7239,1.5283,5.6119,0.6817,2.0864,3.4894,2.3162,0.049,3.7512,1.4155,2.6843,0.0026,1.6882,4.2575,4.2694,3.6559,5.3891,0.6942,0.5122,0.0002,2.6202,0.0052,6.2711,2.4088,5.754,0.8946,0.3314,2.6699,0.7125,3.0312,0.9826,2.2394,2.5111,3.0985,5.2676,1.2658,4.5738,3.1944,2.4069,1.4665,0.677,0.5671,0.0001,3.9735,2.5879,3.9174,2.6631,4.3813,0.4834,0.0034,3.4983,2.3548,0.3943,1.7242,5.3367,5.739,3.2466,4.0979,3.9274,4.4334,2.9235,1.6437,0.0307,2.7532,1.6063,4.3723,3.8848,0.0249,3.8631,0.47,0.1666,0.0001,4.9162,2.929,1.993,5.3461,5.0097,4.7608,4.2133,2.5957,3.3057,5.1274,4.3878,2.7524,0.8332,5.9431,2.104,5.3773,2.5526,6.8704,0.9762,2.7487,4.5655,0.6727,0.2544,0.0001,3.6683,2.0554,5.0889,4.8783,0.0054,5.1458,5.4451,1.533,4.3776,2.8922,0.0071,3.696,2.1933,1.299,0.4167,4.8224,1.1378,5.9304,2.6743,3.8967,1.4472,0.4475,0.0002,4.6065,1.9366,5.9594,0.0035,1.4482,5.681,4.3219,0.766,4.9647,3.7017,5.2815,3.2614,4.0227,0.1181,4.2174,5.3937,0.9141,2.8526,3.62,4.9119,3.4897,2.6466,0.1987,3.0005,5.5642,1.727,4.2589,0.7078,0.2795,0.0002,4.6153,3.1001,0.0814,4.2696,0.6192,2.7983,3.5083,1.9697,1.4504,4.768,2.1642,4.9489,3.5258,0.0863,5.665,4.4052,5.4762,2.4178,3.9087,7.0378,0.6528,0.5013,1.2649,4.7792,2.5564,0.0133,1.3371,1.1613,2.7665,4.0807,3.9576,5.074,0.0004,2.8417,1.688,3.3889,0.261,2.5389,0.4984,0.1435,0.0001,4.6913,1.0718,4.0364,2.0408,4.7652,2.4498,1.2187,4.8213,4.9255,5.212,1.2322,5.0012,2.7321,4.3075,0.8882,4.4922,3.6687,4.2454,1.3859,4.7426,3.3814,5.8428,5.8992,4.7235,2.4079,1.4551,4.3674,0.3103,1.1146,5.1656,2.0906,4.9807,0.5412,2.3351,3.8375,1.4323,2.6163,1.101,4.0241,1.1467,3.5644,4.4652,2.4775,4.6712,1.3909,1.2952,0.7022,0.108,0.0002,5.8881,5.0385,3.7986,5.4404,3.9338,0.9771,1.017,5.9733,2.0809,2.4589,2.1602,0.7056,0.0003,3.0414,5.4257,2.8599,5.5123,4.3563,1.3846,0.5194,5.4986,3.495,4.6697,6.6105,2.824,2.7125,1.5102,1.7507,1.6702,4.537,7.8127,1.9095,2.9788,1.88,4.7639,1.3002,4.7025,5.4668,1.0439,2.7543,3.7875,1.942,4.0576,0.0003,1.231,0.0006,0.387,0.0007,3.2295,4.7452,0.5204,0.0318,0.1002,0.1011,0.0208,2.7571,0.0086,4.4876,0.5927,2.9852,4.0769,2.6381,5.9136,4.4288,3.1991,1.2665,0.5178,0.0002,0.3043,0.0008,0.2793,0.0008,4.4851,0.3402,0.0068,0.0001,0.0006,1.8754,0.0009,0.0044,0.0037,4.6352,0.3466,4.8932,0.4342,0.502,0.0044,5.3052,4.7974,3.4403,3.1616,0.7666,0.3157,4.4219,4.7975,4.6471,4.1418,0.2017,0.1061,0.2346,0.0002,5.6513]}

He was shot multiple times in the head.\n\nWhen police arrived at the scene, it was already dark and the scene was chaotic. As we reported earlier, two witnesses were identified who were shot multiple times and have since been interviewed but said they aren't sure who fired.\n\nThe witness said: \"The guy came forward later than usual and looked up and said he was a passenger. He said he shot some people but it didn't go beyond the waistline. He said it got out of hand. He said, 'It's not a problem.' \"\n\nWhile at the scene, his friends reported seeing the shooter in a grey car, not in any light or color. A woman in her 50s described seeing a car that didn't have a windows lock when she got out. A witness described being asked repeatedly to give her the car keys: The driver was so shaken he could only move his car.\n\nThe witness also said she heard the sound of gunfire and ran to find the shooter. He got out and started arguing with two witnesses. They ran outside the house and called police.\n\nThe driver, a white man in his 40s, was reportedly in his 30s at that time. His identity is being withheld by a law enforcement source on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"We believe that at least one person was shot in their house,\" Brosses said.\n\nHe said the gunman may have been drunk or in a different relationship. He did not provide the name of the perpetrator.\n\nA source close to the shooting said Brosses was informed about the incident after an acquaintance alerted police.

A nuclear attack on an American city or a city on a world scale, he said, would be the same as a nuclear attack on any nation, including Russia, which he said had the capacity to strike and probably carried out the attack on Syria, and China.\n\nBut the president warned that if the United States gets involved in world affairs it will make it difficult for other countries to maintain nuclear weapons. He said that not only wouldn't that be unacceptable, it would have a global impact that would have very grave consequences.\n\n\"To be absolutely blunt, all of this, which will impact on our national security, may well impact other countries,\" Obama said.\n\nBut the international community and the West say that nuclear power is a far more effective alternative to oil and gas than oil and gas as they had long thought. The Paris Agreement, which would have extended the agreement to other countries, would have allowed countries to build nuclear power plants, and as a result would end up producing more oil and fewer gas than what's being produced now at U.S. reactors.\n\nEven though Iran is not as energy independent as is the case in any case, Obama said that Iran's nuclear program is an economic disaster.\n\n\"They don't work well. There's nobody who can build a nuclear reactor,\" Obama said, \"so that will have an economic catastrophe for the country and, you know, the world at large.... If you want to save the world from that, I am absolutely right about that, you know, absolutely right...

The man inside the interrogation room claims to have an incredible secret that will exonerate him from his murder charge. You can't imagine what monster would murder a 1 year old child, let alone one as adorable as young Adolf Hitler was.\n\nJust one more example of the insane level of fear put into interrogation by men like Hitler is when they make up their own explanations of how Hitler has murdered innocent children to further their propaganda.\n\nHitler's children have never been seen alive in German history.\n\nHow did Hitler and his army rape over 1000 innocent people, and then massacre them all at gunpoint at the behest of his military leadership in Auschwitz?\n\nHitler personally ordered 9,000 Jews to die in Auschwitz and the Red Cross would never accept them.\n\nHe personally sent over 800,000 SS prisoners to Auschwitz which his own SS leadership were not willing to allow to the rest of Germany.\n\nThese people are living like Nazi prisoners in an international hospital where they died in blood-bathing and agony.\n\nIn the very name of science there are a number of studies which show that Auschwitz was made by humans.\n\nAs a part of this incredible cover up in this paper we need to get on with this investigation on a deeper level of criminality and genocide.\n\nTo that end you can see here a video where the US State Department investigator says some very shocking shocking things about the way in which the US Government uses these kinds of crimes to further their agenda.\n\nThere are even more video of the actual Nazis on the television and at the offices in Europe. They even provide fake video evidence to further their agenda that they hope will convince us to support their murderous agenda and use this in their propaganda.\n\nMore Videos Here, click here to the video below:\n\nThe article above makes this very clear but if I must say I am not a complete debunker I would strongly suggest I visit the following pages:\n\n\nhttp:\/\/www.thefreepress.com\/articles\/history\/1925_wtf.htm\n\nhttp:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.co.uk\/the-story-of-malfunctions_n_14782325.html\n\nAdvertisements","token_len":464,"entropy":[3.8828,2.7333,7.9675,2.9229,11.9274,12.0489,1.0498,3.3461,4.9949,7.5585,1.516,7.7036,0.4032,6.5844,1.1853,0.5692,4.7392,6.0779,4.7088,2.5048,2.6266,7.1195,0.0008,1.0539,1.8425,3.2598,3.4312,3.7223,0.475,3.591,2.9126,2.6342,5.0371,1.5548,10.7954,2.6623,6.2134,1.3122,7.3522,1.9426,0.0377,2.0467,2.7423,3.3855,0.0004,3.1605,3.9854,4.9353,0.197,7.7285,5.2083,0.4409,7.1921,0.452,1.5984,0.011,5.6647,4.4057,2.358,4.1506,0.5068,1.5016,4.5958,5.4958,0.0378,5.1708,5.4551,1.1314,4.5346,2.6652,6.5799,1.613,3.4875,3.9622,4.2716,2.0998,4.7712,4.5673,2.7856,0.6151,4.5748,2.0963,2.8586,2.5523,5.7354,3.9496,3.4051,0.8433,3.9742,5.1643,1.1572,4.191,0.7213,1.4031,0.0001,3.964,0.0015,1.6732,3.9518,2.9846,3.1232,0.3606,2.8616,1.2995,2.2744,5.1008,0.8561,0.6786,2.339,0.0002,4.8879,2.3814,1.7259,4.1222,0.2621,4.4525,6.1061,4.263,3.7796,1.7429,3.1427,2.6323,2.7239,1.5283,5.6119,0.6817,2.0864,3.4894,2.3162,0.049,3.7512,1.4155,2.6843,0.0026,1.6882,4.2575,4.2694,3.6559,5.3891,0.6942,0.5122,0.0002,2.6202,0.0052,6.2711,2.4088,5.754,0.8946,0.3314,2.6699,0.7125,3.0312,0.9826,2.2394,2.5111,3.0985,5.2676,1.2658,4.5738,3.1944,2.4069,1.4665,0.677,0.5671,0.0001,3.9735,2.5879,3.9174,2.6631,4.3813,0.4834,0.0034,3.4983,2.3548,0.3943,1.7242,5.3367,5.739,3.2466,4.0979,3.9274,4.4334,2.9235,1.6437,0.0307,2.7532,1.6063,4.3723,3.8848,0.0249,3.8631,0.47,0.1666,0.0001,4.9162,2.929,1.993,5.3461,5.0097,4.7608,4.2133,2.5957,3.3057,5.1274,4.3878,2.7524,0.8332,5.9431,2.104,5.3773,2.5526,6.8704,0.9762,2.7487,4.5655,0.6727,0.2544,0.0001,3.6683,2.0554,5.0889,4.8783,0.0054,5.1458,5.4451,1.533,4.3776,2.8922,0.0071,3.696,2.1933,1.299,0.4167,4.8224,1.1378,5.9304,2.6743,3.8967,1.4472,0.4475,0.0002,4.6065,1.9366,5.9594,0.0035,1.4482,5.681,4.3219,0.766,4.9647,3.7017,5.2815,3.2614,4.0227,0.1181,4.2174,5.3937,0.9141,2.8526,3.62,4.9119,3.4897,2.6466,0.1987,3.0005,5.5642,1.727,4.2589,0.7078,0.2795,0.0002,4.6153,3.1001,0.0814,4.2696,0.6192,2.7983,3.5083,1.9697,1.4504,4.768,2.1642,4.9489,3.5258,0.0863,5.665,4.4052,5.4762,2.4178,3.9087,7.0378,0.6528,0.5013,1.2649,4.7792,2.5564,0.0133,1.3371,1.1613,2.7665,4.0807,3.9576,5.074,0.0004,2.8417,1.688,3.3889,0.261,2.5389,0.4984,0.1435,0.0001,4.6913,1.0718,4.0364,2.0408,4.7652,2.4498,1.2187,4.8213,4.9255,5.212,1.2322,5.0012,2.7321,4.3075,0.8882,4.4922,3.6687,4.2454,1.3859,4.7426,3.3814,5.8428,5.8992,4.7235,2.4079,1.4551,4.3674,0.3103,1.1146,5.1656,2.0906,4.9807,0.5412,2.3351,3.8375,1.4323,2.6163,1.101,4.0241,1.1467,3.5644,4.4652,2.4775,4.6712,1.3909,1.2952,0.7022,0.108,0.0002,5.8881,5.0385,3.7986,5.4404,3.9338,0.9771,1.017,5.9733,2.0809,2.4589,2.1602,0.7056,0.0003,3.0414,5.4257,2.8599,5.5123,4.3563,1.3846,0.5194,5.4986,3.495,4.6697,6.6105,2.824,2.7125,1.5102,1.7507,1.6702,4.537,7.8127,1.9095,2.9788,1.88,4.7639,1.3002,4.7025,5.4668,1.0439,2.7543,3.7875,1.942,4.0576,0.0003,1.231,0.0006,0.387,0.0007,3.2295,4.7452,0.5204,0.0318,0.1002,0.1011,0.0208,2.7571,0.0086,4.4876,0.5927,2.9852,4.0769,2.6381,5.9136,4.4288,3.1991,1.2665,0.5178,0.0002,0.3043,0.0008,0.2793,0.0008,4.4851,0.3402,0.0068,0.0001,0.0006,1.8754,0.0009,0.0044,0.0037,4.6352,0.3466,4.8932,0.4342,0.502,0.0044,5.3052,4.7974,3.4403,3.1616,0.7666,0.3157,4.4219,4.7975,4.6471,4.1418,0.2017,0.1061,0.2346,0.0002,5.6513]}
{"id":888,"ended":true,"length":446,"gen_text":"Build up a tense scene, then destroy it with a deus ex machina.\n\nIn one of the earliest episodes of Gravity Falls, the show's writers, David Boreanaz and Ryan Murphy, are using an evil alien to create chaos. The story begins, as a group of aliens arrive on an abandoned floating island where the team was once called. One group of aliens is attempting to steal all three points, and the plan is to destroy them all. However, it turns out that the group already possess some super powers, so instead of killing everyone, they attack. To this day, I never see anyone on the scene who is as stunned, shocked, or confused as them. If you want your audience to feel as if they're under a knife while you destroy them with a deus ex machina, go easy on yourself: use them your way!\n\nAfter the destruction of the team, the aliens go off using their powers, and after a second, they're shocked. They see the other team as more powerful, and when they get a chance to get on with their lives, they break the team's plans.\n\nAnd finally, they use their own powers to destroy the planet they want to destroy. When the planet gets crushed, the rest of the team is thrown into the air... then back where they were when the planet was once so much stronger.\n\nEven though there are so many episodes of this stuff, it's never boring as they come together.\n\nWhat's Missing:\n\nMost of these concepts and concepts that were present in the original Gravity Falls are either just missing or poorly done. In any case, if you are a fan of the character, I would greatly enjoy a little more of their work to come up with something that didn't sound like the original. If you are curious about how this works, check out this article from a few years ago. If it is just a small side effect, or if the concept was introduced due to their love for the original character, I would have gladly used it, because I know exactly what to expect.\n\nI would LOVE to hear your thoughts and thoughts on this story. So let me know what you think, and if you're enjoying this story, let me know what you think below.","token_len":466,"entropy":[6.35,1.7086,11.2929,4.1269,2.518,3.6346,6.525,1.4133,2.0174,1.2567,8.3168,3.1626,0.0043,0.0037,0.0004,1.3797,1.6574,0.0146,3.6266,4.3211,0.8439,0.6687,3.7646,2.3388,0.6276,6.0084,0.215,0.2844,2.0336,4.0513,0.97,3.5556,2.7653,3.6798,4.8648,0.3473,0.0007,0.2675,5.291,2.939,0.0706,3.1211,5.422,3.4197,5.5045,3.6399,1.9019,3.7233,5.0705,1.9526,1.9267,5.6907,2.3827,3.4215,2.0705,2.5659,2.7223,0.0278,3.3507,3.4348,1.2253,3.6402,2.296,5.5129,1.1666,4.3327,2.4003,5.0266,4.0057,4.0628,5.0926,0.7457,3.6848,4.1439,0.8592,0.8401,2.4265,4.6371,0.026,3.084,4.3072,4.5165,6.3741,3.0513,1.8215,1.7347,5.6751,0.8532,0.375,2.4576,2.2396,0.5989,1.1023,3.1369,0.042,3.6247,1.1681,0.0046,0.4268,1.0529,2.3879,5.766,5.1284,3.264,4.9272,2.1148,0.7954,1.9249,4.3598,0.2947,2.87,2.2578,0.9904,0.5428,3.9544,3.006,5.537,4.7991,1.971,0.124,4.9099,3.4912,2.5386,2.7908,4.06,0.6927,3.5511,1.917,2.3664,3.7529,5.4109,3.3014,2.9925,0.471,0.8403,2.7711,0.2146,5.2584,0.3749,5.1626,1.0324,3.5497,4.734,2.7693,0.0779,2.1314,2.5975,0.9867,0.9784,1.6854,4.7164,1.9499,4.0536,5.1955,1.7066,4.7018,1.3346,3.5144,0.7702,1.1701,0.0016,0.0023,0.0026,0.0015,0.1709,3.8427,5.9151,0.1234,1.8179,3.7139,5.6241,3.9451,6.166,0.2694,2.4061,0.4782,0.0003,4.7023,1.2393,3.1735,0.2777,0.5244,3.7129,0.6266,0.9367,2.3833,3.6734,3.5287,7.3566,1.9576,2.4024,1.7983,1.3652,4.0726,1.8231,5.2764,1.5381,1.7555,3.3348,5.1442,2.4749,2.2148,4.8218,1.5562,4.1833,1.101,2.9142,5.4794,2.1426,1.2444,0.6574,4.3271,0.4421,3.026,3.1383,0.7394,0.2044,3.6687,3.8467,1.4266,0.9354,1.4,0.1565,0.112,5.1724,2.7181,3.1424,1.0748,3.3267,1.1833,2.3296,0.0002,4.4927,3.6716,0.1581,2.8777,4.5252,1.2215,4.5097,1.4109,0.6732,2.0906,0.7138,3.5241,3.5889,5.3518,0.3654,0.8795,0.671,4.2486,1.1869,2.9422,3.8473,5.3985,0.9627,1.2007,5.9065,0.0407,0.1507,0.6708,2.045,3.7386,0.6943,1.4911,3.8625,7.2378,5.2467,4.3203,4.7072,0.1464,0.855,2.2497,1.1505,2.6555,0.8517,4.6809,4.3033,2.636,1.9567,0.3371,0.9039,0.0002,5.5681,1.2535,3.3933,0.9989,3.5364,0.0646,4.1268,1.6191,2.0697,6.167,0.6054,1.9192,0.5353,4.4335,3.5707,5.5726,3.9714,3.8342,2.3497,1.5932,2.065,0.0002,4.1306,1.6627,5.4271,2.1144,1.5607,0.0002,5.6499,0.5287,2.4478,5.8367,2.7464,1.3918,3.63,2.5969,3.479,0.2615,0.799,1.3172,0.9683,0.02,1.5688,5.3294,5.157,3.2578,0.6174,5.4714,3.4621,0.346,3.5939,3.46,0.2752,0.0172,3.1582,0.2247,3.5062,1.8704,0.5018,0.0602,1.0376,5.2852,1.1991,3.373,1.9804,5.3366,4.3996,4.4786,3.9817,0.9026,1.1175,3.6013,2.3246,4.0513,2.3276,2.3758,0.0959,2.5079,1.849,5.6623,0.0008,4.4043,1.3001,2.3642,1.5436,1.3719,3.445,0.306,1.7233,4.806,0.8882,2.1992,2.3709,1.9343,0.3302,1.9554,0.1584,1.619,2.9917,2.4349,4.5382,1.3966,0.3361,0.4795,1.1385,3.63,4.3438,2.8243,4.3026,1.3719,4.0193,5.3481,3.509,1.0799,3.777,0.7801,2.2577,2.9623,2.3249,5.0208,5.8373,0.0043,6.0116,4.8348,1.3499,1.458,1.708,3.4681,0.2384,1.7974,0.7896,4.33,5.037,5.2327,0.7806,3.1429,3.6994,1.4655,2.9118,5.7799,0.5038,3.4346,0.2264,0.945,0.4907,0.0003,3.2412,2.2375,5.6424,0.2525,0.7652,0.9302,0.5865,2.4383,2.8995,0.5672,1.0937,3.0794,1.3646,5.2861,3.6109,0.2757,0.0097,1.0159,0.1557,0.0956,2.384,0.8011,1.7165,0.3806,3.5954,4.3959,1.403,1.4566,0.4495,2.5848,0.0606,0.0063,1.5554,0.3492,0.4482,5.0771,0.6499]}

He may then spend five to 10 minutes looking for them.\n\n\"You are seeing needles popping out of my nose. That's a threat to my life because if it gets through to them, it can get a lot worse \u2014 it could kill you.

If a member of the public tries to use an un-approved prescription for drugs that are not approved by a doctor or nurse, \"I would do it as part of the procedure,\" he says. \"You just try to ask it out and give it to them at that time.\"","token_len":467,"entropy":[10.602,4.9837,1.1466,0.5476,6.7606,0.9438,0.3641,0.0453,3.0333,15.1881,3.2706,0.0133,5.9652,2.4619,2.4551,5.6457,1.7877,0.3615,0.6463,3.9123,5.4039,3.5655,1.1837,0.3951,4.2839,5.3321,1.6131,0.9015,0.0056,2.3608,5.9708,3.9669,4.8824,5.5121,0.7031,1.8515,5.9445,4.5268,0.4645,5.0488,0.0038,2.1866,4.7514,4.7545,0.3324,5.0828,5.7259,3.7567,2.6327,1.6794,0.0013,3.4847,5.8828,6.0599,6.54,5.8949,6.0565,0.2226,4.1383,1.4736,0.5922,0.0002,6.0223,5.8723,3.0135,3.8572,4.797,0.6397,1.1115,3.2043,4.1335,3.0829,4.1696,2.1641,3.5794,6.2024,2.7854,5.1979,0.7145,0.8917,4.8927,1.7089,2.1128,0.8942,0.5362,0.0002,1.7946,2.4,3.3451,1.5557,4.1908,5.3507,2.0344,5.0869,5.7376,1.8332,0.1074,0.2532,2.8323,2.3756,3.0111,1.656,3.3304,3.9465,1.4982,3.3318,5.6747,0.9141,4.6112,5.194,6.1855,1.4281,2.4153,1.6732,2.5494,4.6807,1.8764,4.0418,2.7443,1.4592,5.0112,3.1289,3.8569,0.8901,3.1705,3.5183,3.0059,0.3337,4.7969,3.1837,3.7131,0.9283,5.1866,2.8618,3.9599,1.5868,1.7983,1.7067,0.9086,3.2352,1.1504,0.2991,5.6617,4.9756,3.7175,0.1328,1.7408,5.763,0.0,0.045,0.564,5.7662,0.9098,1.5322,0.1985,0.0008,4.2425,0.0017,0.0184,2.4751,4.5646,0.6558,0.6158,2.3065,5.6086,0.0364,0.6528,0.0512,4.2667,3.7935,0.6836,0.3242,0.1628,0.1792,0.2011,1.3888,6.134,4.5781,2.448,0.2986,3.5319,0.3619,4.3703,4.958,7.4663,1.7892,1.7676,0.1667,0.0002,4.4762,0.1694,0.0006,0.0002,0.0005,0.0008,0.0008,0.0001,5.0836,5.5522,3.8675,1.251,4.553,3.6482,2.221,0.5277,3.5496,0.8928,2.0251,1.2036,0.0004,2.9412,5.3019,2.9378,1.912,4.9502,0.7777,2.2939,3.6172,1.0089,0.7161,1.0867,6.1142,3.6928,0.8576,3.5071,0.393,0.376,2.4932,1.8619,1.5827,4.9723,2.2903,1.6031,2.3276,1.1145,1.7399,1.9631,2.1444,0.5011,5.4517,0.1337,5.2173,3.4362,1.7718,0.7831,3.9745,1.1487,0.2441,2.0241,6.3033,1.942,1.97,3.1217,0.8618,0.9787,3.0779,3.5423,3.7912,5.4436,4.9077,1.212,0.9134,0.942,4.6595,0.6593,1.6123,1.0855,0.5017,0.0005,1.2973,2.803,4.2272,3.8292,0.9098,5.0699,1.2047,0.2056,5.2396,0.6803,3.0564,3.3264,0.3648,2.359,5.8402,0.8334,0.6305,0.741,4.4319,2.9597,3.2955,2.8287,2.5361,2.1533,4.1738,0.4387,1.9665,2.1187,3.2513,3.7354,1.1147,0.2343,5.627,2.4994,1.2356,1.451,2.508,2.4547,1.8514,2.6484,3.1586,5.1365,3.0531,3.7303,5.9049,1.7891,3.3464,0.6831,1.6061,1.6311,2.4253,0.0121,3.5683,0.9615,1.6787,1.1195,2.8035,0.8033,2.2918,3.3369,0.9459,1.0193,0.0003,7.1425,5.1839,4.4502,0.0631,0.4093,0.0003,3.5582,3.4235,3.6044,2.8323,4.4118,3.2322,0.8566,0.0009,5.8738,0.2534,2.35,0.9071,3.7227,1.8499,4.1643,3.3401,0.3002,1.2601,5.5245,2.6252,0.7094,3.5337,3.4855,0.5133,1.3345,4.7498,2.0685,2.3758,3.7573,0.1664,0.361,0.539,0.0002,1.3057,2.2504,3.4637,4.6657,5.2447,1.7696,3.3188,3.9606,3.0778,4.0951,0.1295,2.2529,4.608,3.5736,0.9123,1.2456,0.2557,0.0007,3.8453,4.1271,4.8175,0.2354,0.0705,2.1713,2.3373,0.0661,2.8147,0.476,5.8205,1.8669,0.3522,5.9204,2.4544,0.0025,4.9822,0.0812,0.1366,0.3693,5.8235,2.0574,6.8873,0.037,0.5978,1.1067,4.5208,0.0617,2.5879,2.8315,3.4917,3.5081,2.6698,4.8917,2.7159,3.487,2.6897,1.7453,1.7543,0.726,0.6733,2.1427,0.8543,3.571,2.7798,0.2366,2.1202,3.7283,1.9249,4.149,1.4963,4.03,4.2541,0.0016,1.5605,3.0351,0.8338,0.3309,0.1269,0.1425,1.4763,2.6438,4.2858,5.1904,0.3598,4.0088,1.2233,0.1245,2.1774,4.8993,0.3913,1.4551,1.293,4.7061,2.3951,1.2937,0.5335]}

He ends up blowing his cover in order to save your life.\n\nHis daughter was in the house when she went missing. The man who shot his daughter shot her with a.22mm handgun, and she has been missing for 3 months. The man who shot her also shot her with a.22mm pistol and was taken to a local hospital for treatment. He is now on life support, and will be able to visit us for at least 5-6 weeks.\n\nHe's been taken into custody by cops with the use of tear gas.\n\nA neighbor told KOMO TV that he has since turned over all of his belongings to him, which include a laptop, a mobile phone, and a large bag.\n\nHe has posted $100 in bail on this blog, and he's also asking that any police or other witnesses help him with what he knows. It's impossible not to think of the following actions.\n\nIf he's not charged with any crimes, I believe police, or anyone in any law enforcement agency, can give him a chance to defend himself, like last week.\n\nWe need your help to help us get this guy back where he is. We need to find this guy who will defend his family, and now there's no other option.\n\nNow we need help to find this man who will provide the justice we need. We need to find someone who'll do a decent job of protecting our community from this guy that can protect us all.\n\nNow, if we're successful, we can start a national boycott of Apple, Walmart and other big companies using social media on our behalf, as well as pressure them to cover up information about him, his family, and any other people that might have something to do with this, just like police are always able to do to make criminals think twice before murdering a person over a cellphone.\n\nWe have been calling for this company to show it's going to protect their users, for the people who rely on it, and for their own security. We are at a crossroads, the internet at large, and the law isn't giving us what we need to protect ourselves, our community, and our freedom.","token_len":467,"entropy":[11.1646,0.995,3.2001,0.6733,9.4147,3.1888,4.8994,7.4398,1.6489,1.0151,2.3146,1.0542,4.457,0.7826,0.7578,1.8834,8.4003,0.0265,7.6073,2.674,4.6437,3.1247,2.7074,0.0184,3.4966,3.5841,1.0513,0.54,2.2173,0.0087,5.02,6.4466,2.4874,3.367,0.9214,0.8674,1.5119,1.9501,2.9219,2.0632,1.0997,2.7177,2.2005,2.8294,4.3531,3.2649,0.3978,5.1624,1.6247,3.2087,0.3108,9.6789,6.3613,3.3945,2.0382,2.0729,2.1448,2.3274,3.6251,1.1063,2.2939,0.7951,2.6657,1.686,0.3763,2.4479,1.1142,0.6728,0.5094,1.0058,4.2233,0.7621,0.6282,1.4371,0.2092,1.4622,0.3141,0.3311,1.7931,3.1906,3.7023,5.1192,0.5648,1.2993,1.6268,0.089,1.9056,0.6934,0.278,2.2574,1.4818,1.5992,3.3056,1.65,0.0056,2.7008,1.1355,3.0507,0.7935,2.9323,0.0082,4.9359,5.8058,1.7163,3.4809,0.0047,3.7442,2.6837,0.8715,0.9449,0.4647,0.7372,0.0002,3.0315,2.8217,1.5945,4.8144,2.3651,0.2951,2.5172,5.4317,4.6579,1.1692,5.0529,0.0041,5.9598,0.0604,1.3316,1.5023,0.0002,3.8659,3.9855,2.1603,3.8837,3.8041,0.0358,5.4383,0.7831,1.5426,3.3292,5.7101,5.032,3.2015,1.7179,1.249,0.362,1.3827,0.6043,2.8831,1.6243,3.1696,3.3181,1.3967,4.6629,0.5319,1.2606,4.5674,0.0662,0.2266,1.2646,0.8549,3.7239,3.0914,2.0551,1.0732,0.0002,1.9563,2.3019,5.5468,2.6134,2.3494,2.2182,1.8329,1.826,4.4289,3.0738,1.4268,0.7706,2.0231,1.2936,3.1891,4.1699,2.5463,4.1099,5.1024,2.6557,2.0681,2.4465,4.5768,0.8223,2.1669,4.1482,0.6605,4.293,0.7716,4.8931,0.7448,5.5497,3.8604,0.0182,2.878,1.1674,1.9181,4.786,4.9844,3.2354,0.3546,0.0002,3.5554,2.6975,2.0372,2.1586,3.2557,0.7273,1.7335,1.206,0.4794,3.6633,4.1521,5.6144,4.1308,2.5347,1.494,2.8224,3.4014,3.5378,0.0222,0.9775,0.6828,2.4109,5.5486,0.3587,1.0965,2.4759,0.3174,4.1552,0.0726,2.4015,6.0351,6.1673,1.7317,0.9739,0.9668,0.0002,3.8792,2.5617,2.6384,0.0843,1.3409,2.0397,2.1906,2.0622,1.1581,1.9961,2.7616,5.0536,0.0648,2.0024,0.4966,2.6085,0.8547,1.7476,3.2799,3.0215,0.9047,2.5785,3.3303,4.0575,1.2514,1.4471,1.4535,1.0111,5.5355,5.336,0.6094,0.8661,2.1502,1.5584,0.4685,0.6613,0.0002,5.0348,3.3383,0.7878,3.311,1.022,1.8034,1.7459,1.4734,0.8697,0.7517,5.1809,2.6475,4.1451,1.7006,0.2789,0.912,2.2111,0.3299,0.6715,0.6721,4.1969,0.4843,4.4613,3.7771,3.905,4.7301,0.0282,1.1459,2.5798,1.432,1.645,1.9638,1.1484,2.8382,4.1532,4.7061,3.401,1.3854,1.6218,0.535,0.4168,0.0001,3.2045,1.8491,2.0699,2.2291,3.4983,3.1666,0.4519,0.9028,0.8348,3.0898,2.4482,2.7596,6.1122,0.4567,6.3176,1.7841,3.718,2.5301,0.9349,2.1756,1.8411,5.6797,3.3807,0.0224,5.2935,3.6316,0.0377,2.4039,3.3611,0.4593,0.1043,5.5662,2.1798,0.1702,5.6541,0.6252,6.6169,0.9824,3.6729,2.3015,3.3681,1.8772,0.5034,0.4208,3.6233,1.3883,2.8058,2.2642,1.1574,1.2695,4.5562,0.0973,0.3346,0.0045,0.8585,4.2152,4.717,1.3688,5.282,3.0882,4.351,4.3401,0.0105,0.2779,3.1068,4.9838,5.5704,4.0214,0.852,0.8265,4.9909,2.0523,2.1352,6.8311,1.413,4.9031,0.3288,0.2538,0.0002,1.608,3.52,3.981,3.8124,1.4808,1.7984,6.3865,0.2895,5.7337,3.7867,0.7836,4.6499,0.1244,3.5912,2.8063,4.8355,1.1881,5.4272,2.1835,2.7652,0.9125,4.8308,0.0671,1.54,0.8456,0.4268,0.6306,3.2056,3.6338,2.7641,0.6432,1.6818,2.6484,5.8659,1.1087,1.5739,0.0145,1.8912,4.7924,5.3075,3.9372,0.0647,0.8699,0.3794,2.4737,3.4907,5.2997,0.0003,4.2269,0.462,3.1878,0.0823,0.6362,1.8388,1.1589,0.6937,2.0022,1.6788,2.2462,0.3581,0.6141,0.3874,3.3022,0.371]}

Grimes is charged with first-degree murder.\n\nThe case is being investigated by the Suffolk District Attorney's Office.\n\nB.J. Grimes faces charges of conspiracy, conspiracy to possess an explosive device, using a firearm in the commission of an offense and providing false information to a public trust in exchange for monetary damages, according to a press release from Suffolk District Attorney Eric M. DeGiorgio issued Thursday.\n\nM.F. DeGiorgio also charged that he met with B.J. Grimes via social media, with which he also discussed what happened to B.J. last April.\n\nThe former waitress was in a car with five other women at about 6 p.m. after a midnight shift when the driver, who got out of the car late and turned, drove past her.\n\nGrimes, who works as a customer service agent for a chain of convenience stores in Connecticut, said in the press release that when she was waiting for her shift to end, she began to run ahead of B.J., and she thought he was already back in the car.\n\nShe told her, which turned out to be untrue, to get on the subway. So she put her cellphone away and the driver drove away.\n\nShe drove further on Highway 40 and into a house in downtown Boston, where she then struck B.J. three times in the head, face and hands.\n\nGrimes died of multiple stab wounds to her head after the incident went viral. The victim is presumed dead at this time, police said.\n\nThe case is U.S. Department of Justice Criminal Bureau-Homicide Investigation (CIHO) 06817-0683.\n\nIf convicted, B.J. Grimes could face up to 35 years. The charges follow a case in which James Bales, 18, was charged with murdering an Army Reservist at an Army facility in South Carolina, according to the release issued by Suffolk District Attorney Eric DeGiorgio.\n\nBales was released with pay.\n\nThis story, \"New DNA found in case of 19-year-old girl.\" was originally posted on The Boston Globe.","token_len":468,"entropy":[11.0549,0.8881,1.2276,7.9781,0.4093,8.0614,6.8797,1.3482,3.6515,2.3131,2.506,13.035,3.6861,1.5968,1.5153,1.1585,0.0005,5.3209,3.7557,5.2627,2.038,4.7323,3.385,4.4746,0.0724,2.083,0.1551,0.003,0.0913,2.9912,1.0517,0.0002,2.724,5.1046,1.4649,1.3929,1.0212,0.0509,0.6592,5.1564,2.4168,0.0221,0.0298,0.0974,0.5286,0.5323,0.0005,3.8252,3.3291,2.2954,0.217,1.2885,4.1194,3.6435,0.3506,5.2798,2.0863,2.1357,0.0691,4.2887,2.5597,1.7801,0.0963,0.4748,5.652,0.3808,1.1585,0.9443,1.6928,0.0199,0.0087,1.1592,0.3196,1.5197,4.609,1.4418,0.6363,0.8344,0.5503,3.3949,4.4834,3.6694,2.5269,0.0016,4.9119,2.1474,3.0244,1.0082,0.0025,1.9082,2.1771,0.0108,0.8834,1.4527,1.0469,0.0081,5.0153,4.0897,0.0779,4.5485,4.2835,2.3103,0.0423,6.4023,2.372,0.1256,0.179,0.0002,3.4195,0.9549,4.8566,0.1004,1.1128,0.0289,0.0037,0.0005,3.1074,2.554,2.0186,3.8501,4.6776,0.6811,2.5932,0.0938,0.0155,0.1559,0.1213,4.855,2.7259,0.0266,2.1442,4.9933,2.9508,0.9935,4.2585,3.4071,4.9457,1.9109,1.2545,3.1983,0.0119,0.0027,0.299,6.5537,4.0088,1.0855,0.3791,0.0002,2.0466,5.0904,5.9669,1.7125,3.9352,2.0139,1.9509,0.7676,5.2378,0.5284,1.7329,2.1895,2.4455,2.6236,1.1784,0.0005,0.0002,0.1234,4.2343,1.9786,4.3223,3.0465,2.6836,2.3759,2.1459,2.8106,1.3946,5.7018,0.4445,0.1871,0.8325,0.1944,6.5747,1.4047,4.3223,4.7301,3.0242,2.5523,0.9061,1.8158,0.9752,0.0001,5.5133,0.0004,2.0713,1.2838,3.5685,1.2047,0.2202,5.4838,0.0855,3.3539,1.3069,1.2943,3.9826,0.1927,2.0562,0.0744,1.5312,4.0883,0.1196,3.0717,3.3108,0.6818,0.6955,0.0019,0.4219,3.8229,0.8642,3.0514,4.6959,0.9878,1.4455,1.4518,1.2516,2.1739,0.5335,0.9835,4.9861,0.8755,4.5003,5.7279,0.5495,1.5669,0.0042,0.002,1.4419,2.635,2.6192,4.539,2.6936,0.3029,5.8628,5.0137,1.1496,0.4758,0.1195,0.3474,0.4248,0.0001,2.4548,2.944,1.965,4.5174,5.5462,3.2929,0.0155,0.1179,0.0193,3.1611,0.0804,3.4553,2.6255,3.5503,0.44,5.6987,1.6825,5.5785,0.3945,5.021,0.7746,3.646,2.9646,0.7755,5.4036,1.2712,1.9716,1.7517,0.677,0.4694,0.0001,3.0263,3.2767,5.2908,4.4259,5.7047,4.6937,1.9629,3.8506,1.5319,3.6669,2.28,5.7933,1.9984,0.9063,0.4754,0.7018,5.6278,5.5954,2.6597,0.0055,0.0012,0.6835,4.2819,0.083,1.2727,0.1383,0.7329,1.1034,5.8824,0.1918,3.6418,0.9565,0.6043,0.0001,2.057,0.004,4.5593,1.8179,2.3686,1.828,0.0072,1.5617,0.7742,0.6074,4.1901,0.9595,2.5535,7.5405,1.527,0.8403,2.9479,3.5262,3.0263,5.0665,0.9149,1.3003,1.9621,0.254,2.5915,3.2408,0.1771,0.1174,0.1919,0.0002,1.8592,2.88,0.9623,6.1399,0.5615,0.0079,0.0068,4.5677,0.0023,0.3273,1.4346,7.2295,3.4221,4.4245,0.0234,1.7596,2.314,2.3127,3.2766,0.8591,5.4515,3.6478,5.7533,1.2004,3.191,5.3375,0.6648,0.7567,0.0003,4.8685,0.9466,0.3093,1.421,0.0232,0.0009,0.0247,1.0503,1.5141,0.2984,0.7064,0.0002,4.5295,0.008,4.8172,3.1993,3.1198,5.9179,0.8633,3.8955,1.3811,0.6074,6.6103,2.498,6.7755,0.6039,4.1379,0.0282,0.8486,1.316,0.4881,4.2471,3.2891,5.3421,5.4021,0.0025,2.0222,3.1995,1.0762,4.7216,0.3095,4.6067,0.332,2.6078,1.9884,0.0023,1.0057,2.6995,5.8184,0.2272,1.9862,1.133,0.0084,0.6884,1.3157,0.0086,0.0017,0.0002,0.1539,0.2593,0.0002,1.8022,0.0415,1.4206,3.197,5.4088,2.9596,3.2373,0.6441,0.0002,4.1289,0.9724,4.2333,0.245,5.0053,5.7576,3.9184,0.8932,4.9852,0.1017,5.9896,0.136,0.09,0.0359,0.0017,3.6198,5.1255,0.7549,0.5743,2.9816,1.249,2.268,3.0399,0.1037,0.9592]}
{"id":1163,"ended":true,"length":458,"gen_text":"Kid's imaginary friends are actually past life versions of themselves trying to fix issues they during their lifetime.\n\n. The fictional characters of the game don't actually exist. Even though most of them did have actual lives, their relationships were real and those relationships were actually real to the story, not a part of the game.\n\nEven though most of them did have actual lives, their relationships were real and those relationships were actually real to the game, not a part of the game. If it's easy to talk to your characters, you have to talk to the real characters of your universe. To the extent that I know of anyone playing a game where characters are actually real with actual lives, I don't want any one reading about it.\n\nYou still can't say that you like how people treat you, or that anyone can understand them, but it's really your fault, and the fact that it's such an obvious, well-known game isn't the point.\n\nIf things got out of control, it wouldn't make any difference, not in any way at all. A lot of people are on Twitter saying, \"We didn't really think of that when we got this game, we already knew where they want to go.\" When your publisher gets their asses kicked in the head and starts making sure your audience knows that what you write isn't going to go viral and become a huge hit, then I guess the same is true for people who do read.\n\nIn any case, I don't think we're done yet. I will say this again, because I think the games industry is not going to just be a bunch of crazy people trying to convince people to stay in their seats, but rather an army trying to take over a large market, to take over your home console and take over everything that people buy. No one's going to be able to play those games, because everyone will be buying them. The only thing that will change is maybe one big corporation trying to take over some public sphere, that will take over everything in the marketplace; and, because of that, when one of those corporation moves away from you completely, they will have a lot more money. So we won't see you fighting all over the place, but we will see you being more important in the world.","token_len":469,"entropy":[3.8474,11.4018,3.4731,2.6907,4.3728,8.6786,5.0252,8.0394,0.2295,2.5329,7.6225,0.0409,5.0651,6.2506,2.8467,11.4854,1.0036,3.7068,1.7908,1.4598,0.0042,7.8757,2.9823,6.5372,1.8155,2.6889,1.612,3.5638,4.174,0.001,1.9514,1.5361,1.3836,4.9504,1.4278,4.537,0.3642,1.6268,5.258,3.5998,4.1664,1.069,0.7332,3.2139,5.1637,2.0727,4.7724,1.7322,5.8503,0.8274,1.1471,3.8706,2.7188,1.881,1.4609,4.267,2.6954,2.1594,2.8618,3.7981,0.0107,0.4426,1.1374,0.452,1.1295,0.0002,5.17,0.2479,0.4841,0.0027,0.0264,0.0153,0.006,0.0688,0.0022,0.0017,0.0023,0.004,0.0043,0.001,0.0009,0.0041,0.0035,0.0061,0.0178,0.0007,0.0015,0.0021,4.2501,0.0201,0.0121,0.0051,0.0003,0.0007,0.0012,0.001,0.0018,4.1239,3.9707,1.6738,5.513,0.4587,5.0606,2.7423,2.524,2.5138,1.2671,2.2066,3.7002,0.862,1.1946,0.1666,1.9985,2.3128,2.0938,1.8965,2.531,3.7155,0.3472,5.4624,2.7449,2.2676,0.4372,4.0359,2.6892,0.5656,3.2758,4.7289,2.2757,1.3062,2.2567,3.5849,1.1673,2.7885,1.8322,6.4999,2.7785,1.0761,0.3812,1.0736,2.6111,0.0006,3.9363,4.9198,4.4537,6.4394,3.0695,1.0556,0.6865,1.1002,0.0002,3.8136,5.7795,2.5163,0.25,4.1829,1.5479,2.815,4.1287,4.8798,3.9695,3.5044,0.6616,1.5937,2.2352,1.2928,6.4549,2.8004,3.3896,4.7236,1.5417,1.8472,2.5501,0.5641,4.2518,5.447,1.9233,2.9561,1.3432,3.3046,2.6395,0.1216,2.6284,0.5755,4.2118,1.7036,2.2707,3.2591,3.9424,0.3217,1.8687,2.4757,4.6903,0.0003,3.3526,1.7723,0.3518,1.246,0.0002,3.1361,6.7602,4.0684,2.4,0.1128,2.0929,0.6981,2.3122,2.4801,0.0005,3.2915,1.2974,1.2363,2.1168,5.0656,3.1295,2.4543,0.3582,3.1149,0.0095,0.2312,5.3367,1.584,0.0361,0.7245,2.4405,5.4231,4.3837,2.8329,2.2135,0.1568,4.4853,3.4621,0.0003,4.1729,3.5423,2.2133,1.1262,4.2515,0.1935,4.1895,1.3723,1.2961,1.7327,2.2683,5.5674,1.4437,5.0562,2.958,6.1602,0.4491,0.5828,1.4993,5.6561,4.8021,5.8555,3.6528,4.468,5.1505,0.4003,1.9754,0.8386,2.4223,2.0333,3.7422,2.5964,4.673,3.2773,3.8594,2.8822,2.3263,4.4627,0.978,4.5861,1.9792,0.0002,2.8304,0.0675,3.9901,2.4364,3.174,3.901,0.8626,2.9047,0.9204,0.3976,2.3346,4.0818,2.7038,3.0676,5.2554,2.5358,0.1705,1.375,3.6298,0.7051,4.5128,3.4654,3.842,0.7086,0.0002,4.0021,2.8443,0.3548,0.0275,1.8374,2.4239,0.0005,0.9616,3.4171,2.0013,3.8373,2.3985,0.6067,2.0532,5.3403,1.5161,1.2672,3.1155,1.2946,3.6161,1.1595,1.6773,2.4726,5.2814,1.5326,0.9783,4.2378,2.3825,0.6223,4.8576,2.2498,1.8539,1.9171,0.0012,5.65,1.9872,2.8964,0.0122,4.3817,1.4141,1.2969,5.909,2.1907,1.1498,4.0302,2.3545,1.875,1.818,2.8524,5.1505,4.8625,0.0215,3.9891,0.5626,3.5224,4.2106,3.0752,2.3783,3.15,1.996,0.1866,4.4938,4.1861,4.8048,1.4192,3.3234,0.1808,2.4943,1.8442,3.7677,2.7301,0.6974,5.5933,1.0363,2.7345,0.507,0.0065,2.0901,1.5327,0.003,4.0422,3.4688,0.2519,2.3002,2.0043,4.1646,3.191,0.8238,3.8027,0.7387,0.9601,3.474,1.7779,1.649,0.7652,1.6278,1.8712,0.2304,5.8861,3.4873,4.8061,3.8859,3.782,0.0156,1.1637,0.244,4.3069,5.76,4.555,1.5426,3.836,1.3409,2.7494,0.4593,3.2315,3.2761,1.1387,3.8375,6.2431,1.4727,4.6741,4.2374,1.4946,0.5747,0.0781,5.5152,5.7698,1.0055,0.3881,3.9607,5.5548,3.5818,0.797,2.3162,6.4572,0.1989,3.2937,1.4337,2.3933,2.0441,2.9526,1.2395,1.7142,2.3053,3.4989,3.3545,4.2859,0.0006,1.7424,5.3186,5.2153,4.5335,1.576,0.7772,0.7717,1.4755,1.8537,1.6449,1.3883,0.4188,0.661,4.1173,3.8024,4.0446,2.4759,0.8006,3.0096,1.2625]}

{"id":482,"ended":true,"length":453,"gen_text":"You were raised as a wizard in the harry potter universe... on your 11th birthday a scientist shows up and explains you that you have no magical powers and will have to visit a muggle school... but one day in the year 2210 you decide to change your mind about wizards because of the prophecy that has been fulfilled. You learn that the prophecy actually means that humans have mastered magic and will be allowed into other life forms that we would be unable to do without. You are not aware that the book also spells out that you have been tricked into joining war parties where human soldiers and witches would take up the magical cause... or that being a Wizard will always be part of your plans. You were created to serve a better man but for some reason you are completely wrong with your belief system.\n\n\nIn any case, you do not know what to do. One can only be the wizard in your life trying to get back at an ancient, powerful wizard who had your parents wrong and who is now trying to get back to you to try and change your life. You are a child, so you have problems growing up... but what you can do is show them what you have learned about magicians and magicians.\n\n\nIn any case, your parents are your greatest supporters. You will not be put away for being one of the few people who thought it was so important to change people so that they will love you. This is why we will make the best of your life.\n\n\nSo we will do the same at Hogwarts and in every place we see that magical power is coming from people who have gone against magical laws. By doing it at Hogwarts and in every place we see that we are being forced to, then we can learn a lot about people you love so much. So this is how we will fight the enemies that we see all around us. We will build houses that will teach young wizards the secrets of magic so that they may become leaders of wizards that will defend the land against the forces of darkness. The only thing that will stop us is the war that Dumbledore was going to invade, so you know we will bring people together so that we can help protect the kingdom until Dumbledore is gone.\n\n\nI would like to thank Albus and Mrs Weasley for their kind comments.\n\nClick to expand...","token_len":471,"entropy":[5.3684,5.9321,3.2672,0.5593,7.1205,3.3181,1.569,10.4434,1.7963,3.9971,2.3735,10.9065,5.4459,7.1487,3.2,9.9005,0.0615,0.3658,5.9431,7.7655,6.6748,0.0738,1.6231,4.052,4.5106,3.1587,1.2928,2.6884,3.2151,3.7461,0.9,1.7983,4.9352,2.5525,0.1475,8.1562,1.757,7.7597,0.1059,2.4359,3.7038,2.5328,5.3308,0.576,4.9711,1.2811,4.3203,5.1053,3.5159,1.318,3.6867,0.324,5.0713,0.3454,0.9515,3.2029,4.2862,4.0409,1.8088,1.7286,4.7602,1.7111,4.6865,0.6356,2.378,0.9217,1.992,3.502,0.5053,1.8338,1.0743,4.9768,2.5648,0.91,5.977,2.3762,5.4802,1.0246,1.198,2.4641,1.8366,3.5922,5.6238,5.3261,6.1859,0.2986,4.3535,5.1877,3.8303,2.812,1.7488,0.0225,3.3013,2.0193,1.8763,1.7074,2.2895,4.1724,5.5004,0.7023,2.0589,6.2917,4.1706,4.1805,0.506,0.6605,1.6421,2.5418,3.0167,4.7842,0.9184,3.1343,6.7661,4.9973,4.5255,6.7848,2.3278,3.2614,1.9692,3.2995,3.9258,3.6005,3.0225,4.591,4.289,2.9507,4.0031,0.4133,6.0287,1.3935,4.2213,3.2599,5.6253,0.9336,4.0896,0.0042,0.4542,4.2877,0.8822,1.8651,4.9092,5.8482,1.8382,3.0925,2.5458,4.9932,4.2285,3.4205,5.2142,1.7849,0.1634,1.0591,1.8821,4.7627,4.9602,5.8085,1.0069,4.5598,1.8423,0.9393,3.4657,0.0006,3.7735,4.8267,0.6218,0.3322,1.4412,4.005,0.8286,2.5879,1.5148,2.1929,0.4456,1.846,5.6291,4.5277,1.5784,3.772,4.9055,3.8886,3.2106,1.366,0.7326,6.3695,0.053,3.0654,3.2667,1.07,5.2572,4.4392,3.4744,3.4364,0.6175,1.645,3.3042,5.4076,5.4358,4.4101,1.6626,2.0889,3.2081,1.0862,2.2822,0.0291,3.4563,1.2197,2.1035,1.9411,4.0402,3.2032,0.6068,3.8153,0.6886,1.3629,0.6249,2.1211,1.4276,2.3723,3.902,2.8186,4.1099,1.0148,1.8436,6.3419,5.0496,0.0242,4.2197,1.0752,4.0078,1.8185,2.7435,0.5308,0.5466,4.9176,2.5467,2.0748,0.7984,2.6971,1.2974,2.5021,6.45,2.1641,0.8955,4.961,0.158,3.1817,1.4346,0.0005,3.5749,2.6722,0.1295,0.1112,3.5064,2.7684,1.8933,5.3256,3.3534,4.1158,1.3572,1.8656,3.2432,3.0553,1.3991,5.9931,4.9313,2.012,2.5686,5.1711,0.6543,0.7463,2.0315,1.8911,0.8548,5.9053,3.1268,0.8129,4.7726,2.217,0.4448,4.4051,4.4526,4.4092,0.9519,0.8093,4.147,4.5303,0.2521,1.2383,4.5356,0.7497,2.4344,4.2706,4.1966,3.7311,3.2147,2.9218,0.7029,2.3263,3.0828,1.3579,1.0826,0.0005,3.9117,4.6302,1.6184,3.7365,3.4592,2.7982,5.4732,1.2212,2.1229,3.3386,3.1273,5.4412,1.6422,4.0575,3.6108,4.8729,2.1833,1.2813,3.9986,2.1456,3.326,1.2146,2.0446,5.3309,3.384,5.3912,2.0436,0.7754,6.1002,2.274,4.5789,3.1975,0.2832,2.2666,1.5975,0.1889,0.5794,0.4658,0.1305,0.6099,3.6401,1.1336,2.3595,3.5817,0.1819,5.1906,5.2073,1.0321,1.9093,3.4391,2.9332,0.5787,0.7027,3.0531,5.8766,3.074,2.9249,0.5003,0.9207,4.0038,4.3081,0.9536,3.1226,0.4384,0.8004,4.4238,2.6872,5.5931,2.1997,1.99,1.7422,4.1907,0.9785,0.093,0.5338,2.4237,0.3189,5.0505,4.3536,1.9404,1.3198,3.9134,5.5166,1.1086,2.4068,3.4919,0.3667,0.5797,2.7713,0.5478,0.2772,3.8467,1.7469,4.1545,2.0565,4.5362,2.9858,0.7779,4.8633,1.4035,3.4778,1.4877,1.1303,2.3181,0.1367,1.0735,0.6755,4.4157,3.3502,2.0051,1.1248,1.4843,1.0081,1.1149,0.7701,1.2719,4.795,1.5281,5.468,3.492,3.1285,0.0628,5.5874,3.3678,1.9523,2.7284,3.1862,2.5032,0.8399,5.2125,4.2501,0.6167,3.038,0.2671,0.8637,0.311,4.1524,4.1172,0.7841,5.049,5.4874,4.0664,1.0548,1.0132,0.3247,0.6708,0.0003,2.9858,3.553,0.6171,0.057,0.969,6.4274,0.2068,3.6628,4.9961,1.8972,0.1648,1.3923,3.1993,3.0932,1.5511,3.1016,0.0004,3.2138,0.0236,0.0052,0.002]}

{"id":3323,"ended":false,"length":432,"gen_text":"NPR is secretly cloning Ira Glass and plans to replace all their radio hosts with Ira Glass-soundalikes. Ira finds out and covers the story on This American Life.\n\nIt was in the year 2000 that Ira Glass and Ira Glass teamed up in 2001 with fellow musician and Ira Glass fan\/researcher Matt Rokugo to create the Sonic Magazine. In 2004, we introduced Sonic Magazine to the world.\n\nThe site is currently hosting over 1000 unique magazine covers and each cover is featured at least once. Every cover has been chosen by the Sonic editors to provide the best fit for our fans. We were able to offer every issue of Sonic Magazine with a comprehensive description for each cover. We wanted our fans to enjoy the articles, which include stories, tips, features, cover articles, and more.\n\nIt has been our hope that this site would become an international success, but it would really take some time considering the amount of traffic we get on the site and our size. We have now taken over 100 million visitors so far during the second half of 2013!! This may be the biggest milestone ever for our blog. In 2015 we hope to have a million, not just one, readership for each issue (we plan to do a monthly magazine in 2017 to serve the 1 million mark). The monthly will ship on June 4th, 2016.\n\nSonic Magazine is an online news aggregator featuring over 500 articles from around the globe covering music, the business of music publishing, and most other topics that live as they do. We are a monthly magazine with a daily news\/review-type content based on articles posted daily on the site using the RSS, Facebook and Youtube platform.

A few minutes later, he looks at me and shouts at me to stop. I asked him to pull away and he said no, he was just doing my duty. He said he would explain what it was about, what he felt it was, and that he was fine and would come back later. He then got out of the car and started getting more drunk, then said I was driving too and I had no insurance so he asked me to pay for insurance and if it meant paying for your journey you were responsible for your trip back.'\n\n'I'm so sorry sir, it was so scary.'\n\n'I think I went out for a walk with my boyfriend and the driver was so drunk he could barely see my face'.\n\n'We got in a car and when he got out of the car he was just trying to get out of our car. We were about seven vehicles away when the guy started throwing himself up in the air and hitting the floor.' He continued on to blame their driving and said I should have been at my own risk, his 'go slow' was the way I thought of that.\n\nThis may seem like a great idea for many people, especially those with personal experience with alcohol. I can't help but think that it could be helpful. If people actually try it, people won't be as surprised as others.\n\nThis story could help anyone not drinking on a regular basis.\n\nI would love to hear your experiences and any comment you could have on what works for you.\n\nShare this page, facebook, twitter, Youtube and more on Facebook and give your feedback for next week's event.","token_len":475,"entropy":[11.0121,1.551,7.4996,11.2828,9.666,1.3983,1.4394,0.0039,8.7518,0.2066,2.4973,2.7014,1.7813,13.5683,2.0598,5.8368,2.0565,0.8302,0.7858,9.8125,7.1305,5.39,0.0014,1.6865,2.6092,4.9847,3.5473,3.0778,6.3016,1.8414,5.3044,0.9763,5.3616,2.9157,0.9117,3.8634,7.3201,5.2073,3.2326,0.2161,4.6704,5.7689,1.5341,0.655,3.5373,2.6076,3.1339,3.5236,2.3772,3.6848,2.5504,4.4138,0.9622,6.2279,0.7033,2.7175,3.0947,2.5022,0.8598,4.9574,0.1551,0.5136,5.5717,2.4473,0.9649,1.365,1.7505,1.2974,0.0003,5.3901,3.2921,3.2997,5.5481,3.6371,1.4753,5.3159,5.4651,1.7014,1.3724,3.3117,4.9557,1.1848,0.0002,0.9153,2.5267,2.2727,2.2352,2.1239,2.9678,2.9458,1.8913,1.3494,2.2857,2.5878,6.1085,3.8878,4.2969,5.5502,0.6225,1.0625,2.0683,0.3063,0.0003,2.7482,4.5199,2.0047,2.7495,2.5524,4.0542,2.615,1.1476,4.4742,4.9041,2.493,6.0444,1.6986,3.6393,0.8223,0.3426,4.802,3.6179,2.079,2.1533,2.4582,3.2314,5.1951,0.8841,1.7498,4.5394,2.0871,0.3513,3.4852,2.7794,2.6955,3.972,3.7245,1.4644,5.7627,2.1161,1.0605,0.6206,1.8214,1.9716,5.1817,1.0908,0.3967,0.5835,6.3085,1.9001,0.0685,1.2161,0.9169,1.3092,1.1541,4.7187,0.3408,1.4476,4.9437,4.8235,1.4419,0.9657,2.3875,2.4243,1.2563,1.2294,1.8988,1.9316,3.7769,4.4698,3.7603,1.2476,1.7047,2.768,0.9343,2.0812,5.1833,2.1259,4.3935,0.3746,3.4125,2.1816,4.4423,1.5834,3.5485,4.0186,0.4433,2.6039,1.2838,2.9606,1.0198,1.8063,4.2927,3.2601,1.8876,2.9267,0.2748,1.7644,1.142,1.7016,1.6044,4.2193,1.4273,0.4467,0.6677,0.1246,0.5176,2.1753,4.4539,4.1027,1.1967,2.1853,2.9178,4.2502,3.1957,1.3837,3.264,1.7903,4.3963,2.2531,2.0638,3.0378,3.4465,3.1701,1.0009,3.1153,0.4374,0.5867,2.6199,1.0517,2.9529,2.0421,3.7371,2.8854,6.0456,4.9806,0.6373,5.175,6.1896,4.5833,3.377,4.3346,0.7981,2.621,3.5537,5.1235,1.754,0.1679,0.0002,2.0656,1.4616,3.411,3.3936,1.8929,6.1513,0.7829,3.0113,1.4998,3.3556,4.9144,2.7266,0.1895,0.0002,1.7269,1.3553,3.4892,1.9744,5.5434,3.7672,2.7519,0.7435,2.1683,2.0875,0.6451,3.7177,1.2314,3.7565,2.1815,1.935,3.2746,0.3466,1.2448,3.0201,1.5871,1.6726,2.7236,1.7541,5.3134,0.1671,0.0002,1.2579,3.4935,3.7144,3.2583,1.9605,1.1137,0.7976,4.4168,1.6753,1.7737,0.3321,0.8496,0.2212,0.0406,1.0569,2.3736,3.4518,3.6122,0.032,0.9693,1.586,0.4291,3.8387,0.2596,1.4901,2.4357,2.0155,4.6188,5.8859,6.4548,1.4932,3.361,2.4745,2.3467,2.307,4.0759,4.0352,3.6658,1.9549,0.4924,2.0935,1.279,4.0421,1.3421,4.6019,2.3864,8.9626,2.9757,3.756,1.7514,5.9382,6.5507,3.6002,1.7538,2.0386,4.8896,2.3957,1.3757,2.36,4.3989,2.6175,2.365,0.612,2.654,4.8494,4.2925,5.6779,5.0371,1.0548,2.2128,3.1974,3.48,3.095,3.9205,3.3611,4.2111,0.9055,0.3312,0.0002,3.9732,4.881,1.802,0.6899,0.5009,2.0853,0.2627,2.8096,3.6031,1.4827,1.1603,3.2605,1.7182,2.0777,5.1664,2.1893,1.8959,1.7388,1.6093,4.0119,3.7479,0.9705,2.5964,0.1944,1.0574,1.2507,2.0763,1.8669,0.9174,3.5262,2.223,3.8411,3.2122,5.5148,4.2115,1.9654,0.9775,4.3392,5.3326,0.0014,1.5084,2.9078,3.6421,0.8477,3.1551,0.607,0.7444,0.0002,3.5115,3.2495,5.2256,3.1218,3.7858,5.922,4.2456,3.7366,1.4444,0.8286,0.0153,0.8116,1.5234,0.0002,3.1133,2.6706,1.3793,0.1901,0.2946,1.0543,1.7178,1.7801,4.0951,5.7768,1.1296,2.9429,2.1454,1.0091,3.6375,5.1092,1.1689,0.3613,0.5724,0.9406,0.0003,4.4333,0.4877,4.3669,3.5688,5.4824,0.5591,1.131,0.6127,5.8267,1.9212,3.4668,2.1896,1.914,1.6021,5.2414,2.8429,1.7363,4.4317,4.653,1.6028,0.2783,4.4872,0.7835]}

As long as she hasn't had problems with this one drink or at least nothing he's doing that has any effect,\" he said.\n\nAn investigation by Vancouver Police is ongoing on the truck, Bushell said, but he did not say whether a second light was in the way.\n\nThe man is being held without bail, where he faces another charge.

We have great leaders because of you and all the great leaders that I knew.\n\nI want to start asking what it would cost to put into action an amendment that would ban these helicopters from being used for defense purposes. If this was to happen, this wouldn't happen.\n\nWhen I put this idea up on Thursday, I actually thought it was fantastic, that this amendment would be considered so quickly, that I might have done it better.\n\nIt would actually require Congress to study the proposal with a view to making this a reality for 2014. I had no idea what to do. I asked the chairman what his thought was. He said this was an excellent idea, but it would really take some time and a lot of work. He said, \"It's not a problem.\" We should get this legislation approved so we can get it through the Senate and make it to the president in this next legislative session.\n\nI know many have said that, like I said, it has to be taken seriously. I know I'm talking about the public, because the public's right to know which helicopter is which, right now, there are no rules for that. At the same time, the public has a right to know where those helicopters are. We need to go forward in this place, and that's as clear and unequivocal as it can get.\n\nMr. McMillin, we're going to hear you very soon from your staff and, then I can introduce a bunch of other people, so, as we said I want to know at the beginning, what your thoughts have upon a bunch of people I've heard that think this is totally crazy.\n\nI'm not going to go into those specifics, because there will be a couple. The first thing that comes to mind, and I think it's going to be good for you for a number of people, is that nobody here, anyone here has ever had an experience.\n\nI mean, you did hear that a lot of time earlier. So again, I wish you a very happy health.\n\nMr. Hickey is the director of research for Reporters for Responsibility and Democracy.","token_len":479,"entropy":[5.344,2.2838,12.1738,12.0845,0.5095,1.8932,4.0506,1.045,0.5007,9.1501,2.3668,0.0631,1.8613,3.4831,6.6983,7.0941,0.0703,1.7341,2.3219,10.8229,7.745,0.048,1.1037,2.2581,3.0855,3.3642,0.0976,1.2738,1.3337,4.1816,5.04,5.3927,3.3284,2.1993,2.155,5.0534,0.892,3.1319,1.8697,3.8537,3.1812,6.3012,1.4435,2.0357,2.8302,4.3285,1.5949,1.8453,1.0472,1.8484,2.9778,6.3478,1.5129,1.9958,0.0007,2.4885,3.0441,0.3958,3.8872,6.5539,4.2724,4.0886,2.0352,3.4779,0.6224,3.8604,5.3045,2.3841,3.9999,3.5161,1.247,0.2968,4.1706,4.9109,3.3581,2.0028,2.1455,0.6213,1.9488,4.8801,1.4544,0.5333,3.9805,3.162,2.609,2.5909,1.3597,0.3601,4.448,5.0295,0.0006,2.4165,0.4099,1.8359,0.0002,4.6158,1.3507,5.5057,1.5476,3.3269,3.2886,2.4331,7.2993,0.5075,0.8991,5.047,2.249,1.2129,0.613,5.3438,2.0043,3.2244,2.384,2.411,0.5179,1.9356,5.0684,5.1129,2.1345,1.6677,1.3391,1.9088,3.1899,1.6736,4.2598,1.0903,5.1785,0.8853,1.5988,0.0001,3.4538,2.3547,4.863,4.518,4.0148,0.0879,5.6694,1.4283,3.5338,4.7817,2.1512,2.2125,0.063,2.3553,2.9977,1.7368,1.7371,5.1253,5.8956,0.3546,2.1243,4.1301,3.2121,0.331,1.9577,2.6546,1.6025,1.1398,1.2304,5.5201,1.8238,2.9667,4.3314,3.3083,4.5348,0.2787,0.7733,0.8504,0.4016,4.1606,2.0944,2.6485,3.394,0.4778,1.3574,1.6033,2.0893,1.3381,5.9545,1.8209,2.3876,0.5219,2.6975,2.8763,0.3191,0.0281,1.9936,0.6891,2.8147,0.7278,1.8648,0.789,3.1668,0.8163,1.3509,2.2814,4.1506,1.8463,3.6041,3.599,2.7988,1.7724,3.7595,4.5686,3.3141,1.4515,0.2499,1.9453,1.2479,2.3979,1.0531,1.2929,1.565,3.3455,0.5666,2.2125,0.7374,0.4532,4.2854,4.6176,4.3838,3.756,0.0389,0.2636,0.3413,0.0001,1.9371,3.6563,3.8912,3.9593,1.6004,1.7709,2.9823,5.6544,1.9548,0.1595,0.2196,2.1579,4.5827,1.7479,0.6064,4.8227,0.5939,0.6112,1.4167,2.3836,3.7033,2.2524,4.1218,0.3407,2.5235,4.5037,1.4589,4.2199,3.0846,1.351,3.7341,3.514,0.4606,0.2946,6.3752,2.8196,1.5429,2.3886,1.3798,4.8845,1.3647,1.2771,2.846,1.0327,3.0571,3.1963,2.919,2.722,0.4023,6.579,1.0209,0.7762,0.0054,0.0717,2.4144,0.971,1.2225,1.362,0.0965,0.0913,0.1178,3.4882,3.8559,0.176,0.1562,1.4172,2.7801,2.0406,0.2903,4.1899,3.332,3.4909,1.1101,5.6917,2.1333,1.2441,2.7955,0.8073,6.7982,3.6339,2.2358,4.4461,0.0002,0.1423,1.6656,1.6911,1.0538,0.2336,0.2805,0.0001,5.7236,0.0024,6.2437,3.3102,2.2267,3.1856,2.2209,0.9101,0.0384,4.3766,1.9891,3.8836,0.7689,2.2155,2.5722,2.179,2.322,5.8413,5.6644,3.9646,4.2341,4.8801,2.2221,5.7366,0.0227,2.1634,3.0526,2.5592,3.2209,3.871,3.8621,1.7669,3.8919,7.0633,2.671,0.1954,3.7847,6.2489,1.2943,2.1878,1.4562,1.8115,2.9913,2.5431,4.8454,9.072,4.5686,5.7761,0.0023,2.7439,5.1033,2.089,3.4089,3.0878,4.7251,1.3694,0.5348,6.104,3.9023,0.6306,0.7939,0.0001,1.7764,2.4641,1.546,1.3969,0.0163,2.3539,0.3973,4.1289,2.5755,1.3954,1.5446,3.122,3.7809,0.2283,1.3752,3.3069,4.1471,2.9301,0.9438,1.6953,1.5386,3.0452,0.3258,0.1438,2.7794,2.124,0.7913,1.6852,2.0219,0.533,3.0142,0.0022,0.504,5.1106,0.8424,3.8072,5.3035,1.612,2.3629,0.0062,4.0875,0.6585,0.1401,0.9982,5.9804,4.8941,3.499,4.9108,2.0543,3.229,1.4153,2.9509,2.5301,2.2137,5.237,1.6661,0.0001,1.6778,2.5416,0.1551,2.7448,5.544,4.6054,2.0457,3.2695,1.3966,2.0625,3.9265,5.2735,1.6911,4.269,6.438,0.0446,1.2804,6.5493,0.8438,2.0577,0.9884,1.4587,6.2515,0.8224,0.5766,0.0001,2.1466,0.0007,5.5707,4.4727,4.7316,1.8831,2.896,0.0401,4.1687,1.4707,4.9801,1.2872,3.3684,1.5584,0.4195,4.7053,0.8754]}

After learning about some of the other recent tales, Szeke decided to make a separate version using the original character on the cover\u2014but with the exception of one episode.\n\n\"To me, there was no reason,\" says Sieke, adding that the characters in the second version also \"have different names,\" and so may not be the same character. At the same time, the two versions are both fairly similar, and the character's main theme is clear in each.\n\nAnd that's as clear, he says, as it gets. \"The one I get is very, very clear about when the bad guys first meet up with their enemies and find the cure for everything,\" he says.\n\nNow this may be a mistake at my desk; the first version in the series was written in the 1940s, and is the first version that doesn't show a man looking out at the stars for the first time ever.

After learning about some of the other recent tales, Szeke decided to make a separate version using the original character on the cover\u2014but with the exception of one episode.\n\n\"To me, there was no reason,\" says Sieke, adding that the characters in the second version also \"have different names,\" and so may not be the same character. At the same time, the two versions are both fairly similar, and the character's main theme is clear in each.\n\nAnd that's as clear, he says, as it gets. \"The one I get is very, very clear about when the bad guys first meet up with their enemies and find the cure for everything,\" he says.\n\nNow this may be a mistake at my desk; the first version in the series was written in the 1940s, and is the first version that doesn't show a man looking out at the stars for the first time ever. I'll try it out anyway. (I am also sure you can make it so that this is an actual story!)

{"id":941,"ended":false,"length":417,"gen_text":"A programmer working on an experimental AI in his free time begins to suspect it's becoming self conscious.\n\n'It was in the way that I was acting that I felt something approaching consciousness because of the way I was feeling,' says Dr Martin S. Schreiberc, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n'I didn't know what I had been experiencing.'\n\nHowever, when he tried using a robotic body computer to measure his brainwaves, Dr Schreiberc has no doubt it was actually experiencing him being 'conscious'.\n\n'For people who can't see consciousness, I think that would have had something to do with the way I acted\u2014it wasn't consciousness, but something more like feeling,' he says.\n\nDr Schreiberc, who has treated more than 6,000 patients in his practice, says he's convinced that it may be the 'brain signal' that's giving him insights into conscious behaviour.\n\nWhile working alongside his co-workers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, he and his co-worker, Peter Spitzenberg, spent one week studying the 'emergence' of an entire body part\u2014an eye socket\u2014by detecting changes in electrical impulses, which will then prompt the rest of the body to act.\n\nAfter their first test, the group then sent a human video of the eyes to several different cameras that had been trained to scan brain signals.\n\nIn doing this, they found that the pupils of each face were red.\n\n'I think it represents an early step in using brain signals, and I think the way it is described on our computer, is that this part of the brain is trying to learn, which is where the information flow begins,' he says.\n\nHe is now working with three different cameras to see how similar the images were to the real ones.\n\nThey hope it will prove that it is possible to 'cure' symptoms of

{"id":2756,"ended":false,"length":457,"gen_text":"A king from a faraway land sees a clever comment you posted a few years ago. He believes it's comedic gold and that you should be wed to his children.\n\nHis daughter was in the house when she was woken while he was asleep. She did not say what happened and did not leave until she was woken up to find him tied up. Your family could not hold on to that.\n\nHe was taken to a clinic after his wife found him in a manhole in the house.\n\nWhen he arrived at the hospital he was found to have his legs bent outwards and his arms locked behind him so that he was completely out of the room. While he was on the waiting list for a treatment.\n\nThen one day he went through his mother's room and found his wife's legs still bent outwards while another woman was in the living room with him.\n\nThis incident can be considered to be some sort of a case of 'I'm stuck, so there's no work here.' A few months later, the man got his wife a new job. His wife found out the man in this case was really a hobo for not having some kind of real relationship. She decided to take him to some sort of church (now a church where the pastor is one of the ward leaders). The man was so distraught he was only allowed to talk to the congregation for several hours.\n\nWhen the pastor sent him on his merry way to the church where the Hobo was buried in his place, he found the Hobo had lost his sight that day. What happened next to him will only become known through the testimonies of the witnesses.\n\nAnd he has no memories of the incident. He will continue to live in a sad state of anxiety and desperation at the loss of the Hobo in this very matter.\n\nNow what could possibly go wrong with this man? All we need to know is THAT he did not believe the man was a prostitute.

I think the city's had some great success over the past couple of years with the number of jobs it did at the height of housing crisis.\n\n\"But even as you're not going to see that level of growth, you're not going to see the kinds of real change that you think has a real effect.\"","token_len":486,"entropy":[5.2847,5.4611,7.8408,2.4508,3.9563,16.0529,15.1444,2.3004,1.0415,4.7075,1.9963,3.5076,5.8055,1.5695,2.3001,3.0272,4.9468,12.1796,0.9479,6.1816,1.1632,4.0106,3.5624,2.2739,0.9542,4.5338,2.4604,0.0043,2.2359,3.2396,5.3267,0.9863,1.4321,3.575,5.1776,1.1463,1.5524,5.6192,0.8,2.6678,1.739,6.2793,2.6732,1.1083,3.643,1.1815,2.2498,4.5782,1.837,5.1654,1.0699,2.099,1.5669,2.4311,4.2976,1.3132,0.9562,3.7379,0.0003,0.5632,3.418,2.7983,1.351,4.8489,0.736,3.5087,0.606,3.2008,2.8711,5.0671,4.3466,5.4331,0.469,1.8238,2.7084,0.1405,0.0004,3.3266,2.0804,5.355,6.1479,3.7421,5.2822,0.0007,2.8912,0.25,2.2167,5.5665,2.7042,2.6708,3.901,0.9595,2.3539,0.6123,0.3327,0.0003,1.0122,4.3233,0.712,4.2405,2.1331,1.5246,0.6572,4.5922,5.2864,0.6229,0.5492,4.8678,2.3908,1.4344,0.4831,2.9908,4.1231,4.8953,1.2307,3.9705,4.4744,0.699,4.8066,1.616,4.5826,1.1702,4.848,2.7546,4.0635,4.808,1.9618,5.7328,2.7092,3.2284,1.4345,4.3656,0.7517,1.4239,5.927,3.5876,1.1477,3.2836,1.8708,4.0359,5.8093,5.3996,0.769,1.5561,2.0752,0.0656,1.9494,4.2516,0.5975,4.8996,3.689,2.3194,4.3014,3.0523,1.6774,1.7164,2.5872,0.8437,0.9701,6.6254,0.9893,3.1644,2.5881,2.9218,1.4369,0.19,0.0003,5.6263,3.4729,4.3465,2.125,1.9345,2.1277,4.569,3.0561,1.117,2.5142,0.0151,0.6696,3.2704,4.6207,0.2395,0.0003,2.6312,5.8457,5.3757,1.6618,3.2308,4.3001,3.3599,1.1125,1.9948,2.9884,4.1231,1.2914,0.7835,1.2483,4.2777,4.924,1.0047,0.0694,5.3373,0.0459,1.0223,2.2188,3.3674,0.2167,4.2291,2.039,1.8939,0.5397,0.6682,2.7277,0.7516,0.1401,0.0005,4.0987,3.7795,5.9328,4.7421,0.215,0.0356,0.0001,5.1477,4.0688,2.3731,4.4436,5.1678,0.5806,2.4128,0.455,4.5417,0.0908,1.2542,2.3828,0.0013,1.9472,0.5141,0.1375,0.261,1.5411,0.0677,5.732,2.7569,1.3368,1.3328,3.2878,3.216,0.809,2.222,1.2799,0.6725,0.9221,3.3592,2.4999,4.9975,0.541,1.5613,4.8267,2.7318,2.2149,4.5194,3.0988,3.545,4.6729,4.1051,0.9123,1.2896,0.4779,5.9313,5.8358,4.286,1.49,0.6734,1.3184,1.8588,0.7136,7.4973,0.675,0.3847,0.0026,1.7485,5.1055,3.9703,1.6004,4.2937,4.9825,4.118,4.9927,3.1831,2.7838,3.2726,0.1183,0.9769,4.2084,5.0884,4.6866,2.3598,5.4737,1.5607,1.9328,3.8189,1.6385,1.0811,0.4275,0.0004,0.0145,0.6993,2.8435,1.5243,0.0399,0.0003,2.0874,4.9516,5.1507,3.0349,1.9932,3.9136,2.1523,4.0794,1.8086,2.0936,4.8544,2.7657,3.095,5.2168,0.308,3.7553,0.4497,2.1173,0.4098,5.357,5.8245,6.1561,1.666,3.5892,4.1617,3.3358,5.0485,7.1852,5.3412,2.9861,6.0959,2.1728,3.3884,4.0138,2.4204,3.8132,2.0501,3.1488,1.768,4.5442,5.4893,2.1424,2.1386,3.4743,2.6651,4.6427,0.5538,4.3026,4.1565,3.0276,2.8414,1.1807,0.1786,0.0004,2.7313,0.5083,0.3398,3.4707,1.9417,2.792,1.8993,1.6996,4.4244,0.0163,4.4927,4.1122,0.267,0.006,0.8054,5.9159,2.7411,2.6057,1.3777,3.8809,2.254,5.3453,4.1604,4.9922,1.534,5.0742,0.0561,4.103,1.0493,0.1881,0.0004,1.8618,0.4996,0.6869,0.0045,6.367,6.1453,2.6567,1.4667,2.9489,6.5024,3.0041,3.0524,0.9059,3.0578,0.0144,0.7088,2.8335,3.6345,1.3818,5.9799,1.9185,1.9615,1.5921,3.7644,1.5568,2.1271,4.3077,3.1745,5.4001,3.0155,3.979,2.2474,4.5492,0.0761,1.764,2.3237,0.0522,0.1342,1.6889,1.809,4.9665,0.0213,3.6929,2.9707,5.2212,4.267,0.9427,5.3234,0.0271,4.3418,1.7412,1.0508,0.3178,0.0002,0.0564,2.0091,5.3386,4.1773,4.1083,2.7512,5.1198,1.9367,0.0851,1.6098,3.3481,4.3782,0.0878,2.6308,1.0025,1.8356,1.0911,1.9376,0.0961,0.0083,0.1668,2.1291,5.6668,0.0008,6.0049,2.7651,0.4972,2.132,3.7437,5.3073,4.8294,2.7383,2.1033,2.0241]}

{"id":3902,"ended":true,"length":466,"gen_text":"D-Day is a catastrophic failure for the Allied forces, but one soldier's plan for E-Day is so stupid, it just might work.\n\nHowever, that idea is almost doomed by the odds. The German troops need to defeat every other enemy in the whole Eastern Front, and if the Germans actually lost to the Soviets, it would prove that America's victory is contingent on fighting the Soviet Union. This is only half of the game. The rest is all up in the air.\n\nA war is always a struggle and it is easy to lose or gain. We have all been there. On the other hand, America can win the war and have a victory on the battlefield at all costs.\n\nBy winning this war, we will lose our ability to fight the Soviets. As a result, the battle will be won on our own.\n\nAs America's war losses have grown, especially during the first half of the war, it will be very difficult to achieve our objectives at all and the Allied commanders who have been so loyal during the war won't even let us know that the enemy is losing, let alone when it will become clear to them that they were not victorious. If the American soldiers do defeat the Soviets, they will destroy the whole planet.\n\nI'm all for this, but the problem is that the only way there will be is if our enemy's leadership accepts it without any real thought. This is something that we will lose the war on. The only thing that can prevent that from happening is American forces fighting the Soviets.\n\nAfter this battle, will we be free from responsibility of our own decisions? Does it matter if we have a 'right' to kill people on our own land or in this war?\n\nNow, I am not a 'right' to kill anyone on my own land or on this battlefield, just like every other military in WWII. However, if those fighting American troops could have informed us what the battle is about instead of just shooting it down with a 'black box', it will be much easier for us to accomplish our objectives at all costs.\n\nIt will be harder for Americans to get their hands on supplies, especially since they will have fought so many battles without even seeing our people slaughtered on battlefield. The only way we will have good war is if the Americans have a real plan and can make it a real battle.","token_len":488,"entropy":[3.7522,5.76,4.522,2.0584,9.1073,3.169,2.4674,1.1678,10.4631,1.8444,1.954,2.5233,4.0796,10.2497,3.1724,7.3441,2.4904,9.1679,1.8119,4.3413,1.2814,4.6359,5.0604,2.1827,1.6004,5.544,2.3325,2.1966,0.3661,1.1151,0.0047,6.6064,0.0808,3.9476,5.8104,1.3787,5.1484,5.7155,3.6962,0.8953,5.9109,0.5265,1.8431,4.0302,3.4575,5.3462,1.0441,5.3595,4.8074,2.7265,2.0026,1.7916,0.8011,4.6412,5.6065,0.2701,1.2536,1.2206,3.1502,2.1455,1.8323,5.5571,4.8004,3.6224,0.7449,2.4847,0.7478,2.2889,0.8981,4.8867,2.3274,5.3569,1.285,4.2518,1.9146,5.5137,0.336,5.301,1.8445,2.6223,0.3607,0.8861,3.6615,1.2204,4.601,3.0929,1.0247,0.3297,5.1718,0.6585,1.8427,2.4565,1.2446,3.9491,4.164,1.8676,0.0479,0.005,0.5434,0.7054,0.0002,4.2749,4.7897,2.2887,3.3061,1.2145,2.9008,3.7347,2.7619,1.3978,5.2482,0.1159,1.8081,4.232,0.6871,1.439,4.2081,2.2214,3.6821,1.9595,1.1759,0.8563,5.9757,1.0993,1.0462,0.186,0.038,5.1413,3.8853,2.7848,2.8431,0.5281,2.5589,4.2138,1.5117,4.3958,3.3387,1.4454,1.2286,4.3523,2.7269,1.5652,0.2481,1.7409,0.0002,5.5194,3.6617,3.0449,0.3116,0.3411,1.3928,1.6849,4.5236,2.61,4.2323,0.0206,1.9204,1.5548,0.8869,1.0136,4.5951,1.9529,0.4126,0.1003,1.7743,5.4749,1.2658,0.87,1.7485,2.3763,2.5529,0.5531,1.2058,1.2921,0.0002,4.1709,5.4693,1.8894,3.1803,5.3665,2.8032,1.6722,0.5585,7.2683,3.3625,0.3913,3.3496,1.4367,0.0264,0.7048,1.2354,0.0955,2.0538,3.8085,1.0692,3.9362,0.514,0.7389,5.2807,3.1632,1.5814,4.2639,1.4892,5.0488,2.777,3.9186,4.346,5.7152,1.7719,1.2559,3.752,3.982,5.8261,0.6787,1.0941,5.188,0.0051,2.6368,3.9342,0.8706,2.0459,1.7317,2.5775,3.1001,0.9567,2.8707,3.3873,2.7862,0.0017,4.8872,1.9413,3.4975,5.0459,0.6968,2.2349,0.5202,0.4311,1.683,4.1967,3.4976,3.7395,0.2669,5.0797,1.6446,3.523,3.5717,3.774,4.7361,0.3396,0.4262,0.3841,1.2404,0.3978,5.567,0.994,3.5527,4.2936,0.8954,0.6315,0.0002,4.1091,2.7656,5.3463,0.087,4.6459,2.5119,0.459,2.7073,4.2895,0.6104,0.4768,1.8785,4.011,0.4273,6.258,1.296,0.1788,6.1724,0.2577,3.8205,3.1815,3.6127,5.0638,5.4512,2.695,5.637,2.413,2.5483,3.4492,0.9852,3.358,0.8476,4.3124,0.8701,2.8201,2.4072,5.4141,2.9735,0.3306,0.7534,1.4694,2.7694,1.6226,2.8713,0.9478,2.2785,3.1731,2.6806,1.5693,0.0392,0.1097,5.5819,4.8131,3.8519,1.9225,0.3614,1.1232,0.5307,0.0002,5.2266,3.5786,3.7833,0.2665,6.376,1.7344,1.589,5.6105,2.1116,6.0571,3.5987,2.3625,0.9553,3.9969,0.7764,6.0516,2.0543,1.3554,1.3492,0.9766,3.2846,2.3481,6.3892,4.1465,0.8457,0.5089,3.3378,3.3791,3.3403,1.1786,1.0087,3.4005,1.3375,3.8772,4.4873,1.8361,0.7507,1.5593,0.0002,5.444,1.0776,2.0674,2.6582,0.856,2.8883,3.9707,2.4766,0.4152,1.165,0.1111,2.6191,1.6591,1.0005,0.0802,0.1161,2.4103,3.0542,1.5804,1.9374,1.3519,4.864,2.0652,3.2749,0.2853,5.6914,3.6061,6.5726,0.533,3.0531,0.016,2.2597,6.0411,6.8441,4.514,1.4974,4.7795,3.2094,5.3174,1.1853,3.5537,2.5717,5.2625,3.8788,1.1194,5.4273,0.0526,2.0888,4.4757,3.9728,0.5806,2.6058,1.3146,3.691,5.7972,1.0501,1.2595,2.3891,4.3828,1.1865,1.6265,1.0486,0.6001,1.389,0.1803,4.8414,0.2502,0.8636,3.3314,0.4644,1.6696,0.1446,0.3596,0.0002,3.5597,1.6957,0.916,3.681,0.6981,3.0343,0.1798,3.2993,2.2222,0.7827,0.075,5.7637,1.726,4.9274,2.4572,2.1068,1.1317,1.377,6.8486,2.0293,1.0572,0.9254,4.6236,4.0993,3.486,4.1538,4.3908,4.4776,3.0266,4.8044,4.3709,3.1778,1.777,0.8405,1.8634,1.1699,2.122,6.3486,4.7755,1.5327,0.1354,2.3144,1.3237,3.502,1.7725,3.0697,1.4061,2.3256,3.9294,3.0074,0.8679,4.148,3.8744,3.3208,0.4976]}

Disney has been criticized for over-promising the release of the film.\n\nThe film made less than $12million globally.\n\nA spokesman for Universal Pictures said, 'Based on the iconic classic The Jungle Book we found that the original drafts had been altered so that the revised and pre-produced versions would remain the same after 10 years of making and distributing The Disney Company.'","token_len":489,"entropy":[11.3119,2.5032,0.0002,2.9213,7.6681,8.0113,4.9807,0.1195,3.3282,5.3297,2.1421,2.7477,2.9602,7.0022,2.7706,2.0454,1.7014,0.0002,2.9399,5.085,5.3697,2.16,5.8942,0.0203,3.7089,2.9419,0.0004,0.3059,1.9194,2.5315,2.724,0.3584,0.7729,1.2568,5.6061,0.0001,1.7426,3.7076,4.695,2.9085,2.947,1.4284,5.2522,4.4185,5.4529,0.9742,2.0845,0.87,1.1895,0.0002,5.0106,1.7226,1.9072,1.2789,1.6517,1.0565,4.6569,0.6882,3.3354,2.7592,3.8576,1.607,1.824,4.2949,0.1858,1.6382,3.9625,5.0104,1.3019,5.0853,0.0173,0.9155,5.9659,5.114,1.2308,1.2179,0.4827,1.1866,5.0445,5.8007,5.2916,4.8961,1.2808,5.5528,7.3477,6.1861,0.0608,0.6708,3.4909,6.3047,3.6744,3.9025,1.1386,4.9367,5.5905,4.8682,3.9557,2.5333,4.5135,5.189,2.2899,5.5193,1.035,1.1266,4.0612,1.7777,5.3988,0.3511,2.3231,1.6084,4.2122,4.2013,5.0177,0.835,0.0,1.54,1.5863,3.1524,3.4098,0.191,0.3583,3.5412,1.2934,0.1669,0.0004,2.7276,4.3075,0.3434,3.3409,3.0678,0.8271,3.3614,4.2131,2.9638,4.6064,2.7762,4.6532,0.1044,0.0002,0.5412,4.2339,0.2605,0.4148,3.4109,0.7327,0.3352,0.0,0.0,0.8531,3.8984,0.5944,0.2336,3.195,1.3884,5.6749,1.4359,2.9054,5.6149,1.6928,2.0288,4.3462,0.0817,5.0259,5.588,0.2924,2.2614,1.8328,3.2507,1.9733,2.7141,4.2513,1.8598,5.0376,3.4726,6.0157,1.9581,2.5438,4.3915,0.0228,0.0002,0.7983,0.1963,0.0002,2.4739,3.478,0.1599,5.1937,1.1826,2.97,1.435,3.0869,1.3433,5.9165,0.053,5.9597,0.4892,1.4214,3.799,2.4342,0.351,4.6577,2.2903,0.6601,1.0273,1.2229,2.7385,2.6247,4.2391,0.0263,3.7292,0.0292,2.6902,4.8367,5.7455,1.7339,4.0021,2.518,1.4439,4.0256,0.929,3.9654,4.4216,2.9638,5.887,1.7943,7.2989,3.9613,3.2976,2.3926,3.701,0.4993,0.3028,0.0002,1.7122,1.9525,1.7617,5.3393,0.1514,4.9071,2.3021,2.0007,3.0943,3.3811,2.1575,3.5839,3.717,5.3288,3.1331,3.049,0.4444,1.3998,4.1118,0.0021,5.7591,3.9813,2.8644,2.4939,2.4847,5.0301,4.9204,2.7526,1.235,1.783,0.967,0.3708,0.0003,1.7204,2.3761,2.2177,2.562,5.1182,3.8469,4.7578,3.6837,2.1613,1.2245,4.772,2.9374,5.4568,0.4991,3.9813,0.0439,2.4654,1.1286,4.3786,6.7602,2.4716,1.0222,0.5604,6.3223,0.2042,5.3982,3.2563,6.2594,0.2692,3.0775,0.6345,3.862,0.9163,2.5707,1.2306,1.0137,0.4169,0.0002,5.236,1.5165,6.3473,0.7361,0.0,2.9953,3.8723,0.9523,2.7657,1.9314,3.5848,0.0337,0.0007,1.0525,1.116,0.0027,0.5072,0.1408,0.0017,0.0001,0.0004,0.0001,1.1475,1.3159,0.0071,0.7323,3.9605,1.4699,0.5595,5.465,0.0229,0.5955,4.2401,3.9019,0.5748,4.336,1.0223,0.5401,5.162,2.6987,0.5163,5.545,1.1285,0.9909,5.1871,0.0109,0.8704,3.5702,0.4934,3.8107,2.5655,0.0428,1.3926,5.3951,1.653,2.2488,0.0265,1.1237,4.4927,2.8306,3.7246,0.159,5.6162,0.2489,0.5258,0.2897,0.0001,1.458,2.1296,3.0799,1.0918,1.9033,4.522,4.3642,0.0356,2.2582,1.0572,3.2898,3.3464,1.0056,0.5323,0.0002,3.4007,2.09,2.3666,4.8548,1.7156,2.8502,0.3764,3.7364,1.1678,1.1303,3.0904,2.721,3.0919,3.5756,5.5899,5.8071,0.0142,1.9001,0.0107,3.6201,1.0909,0.3293,0.4821,0.9837,5.1955,1.6793,3.2069,3.6132,0.3694,5.5143,1.2228,1.4182,0.0772,1.4503,3.5478,1.0137,0.5274,0.8385,1.497,0.4714,0.0002,1.8221,1.9163,5.5166,5.2366,0.0696,0.7532,4.267,2.9439,3.7919,3.0039,0.9767,0.0002,3.6529,2.9238,0.2916,1.9956,2.0713,0.5978,4.9482,2.2913,5.2369,0.0592,0.8892,5.2474,4.6158,3.6415,0.0747,0.0003,3.9469,6.1353,1.4256,1.7188,2.1979,3.6693,2.8589,1.9825,4.811,3.3496,0.4826,1.1484,6.0312,4.8905,4.7506,1.1744,3.1584,2.4661,1.6102,5.0395,2.6705,0.1345,5.947,5.724,0.3317,1.4004,4.1273,2.9877,1.9202,2.3194,5.77,1.4072,1.4374]}

{"id":2229,"ended":true,"length":439,"gen_text":"A splinter colony that began from deep space exploration has lost contact with all life for the last 10 years. Today they received a message. \" 'Is it alright?'\" the station's commandant, David Bockin, told space.com. \"It looks good. I know we will be seeing them again in several years.\n\nThis latest observation is significant because it shows that even if life cannot survive on the station's surface, the station could have made a strong and permanent impact on our universe. \"We've seen it happen, and the station already has some life, so it will have the potential to make us feel better about our universe,\" Bockin said. It also means that the long-term prospects for human-sized worlds may be more promising than they already were.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nEarth-like civilizations with little or no habitat can survive but that's the question, Bockin said. \"In other words, there's so much here we don't know about,\" he said.\n\nAt present, a global survey found that the oldest species of life on Earth is known about 500 million to 2000 million years old, roughly 40,000 times older than life on Earth. That's about a billion years longer than even the oldest life, says The International Astronomical Union.\n\nLife may be on the rise, but where will we find it? The European Space Agency says it's already seeing life there but that finding has no bearing on whether or not that life is there any more.\n\nWhat will it be like to live on-Earth and beyond? And when?\n\nBecause if we don't have planet-like worlds, what will you do?\n\n\"I don't think I would want to live on a planet where we are living on Earth. I didn't think I would, either. No, that would be a horrible idea,\" Bockin said.\n\nThe station could be outfitted with an orbiting rover, Bockin said, and that's just an idea for now. Earth-like worlds are currently being explored in the infrared, on an array called the Advanced Global Nearby Surveyor, that Bockin says could be capable of measuring the distance between our planet and its nearest exoplanet. When that is done, he'll give us a sense of how living environments might look on the station.","token_len":489,"entropy":[10.6335,0.7564,6.7258,3.1779,5.6844,5.8953,7.6686,3.4137,7.6697,3.1516,6.3629,4.8462,0.0441,4.8144,1.6836,5.597,1.7199,1.7539,3.4043,1.6727,0.6222,6.1495,5.0173,9.742,1.2616,3.7539,4.5003,2.912,9.8755,5.392,1.7022,5.4925,5.3996,2.16,4.4243,0.6881,4.4116,4.5855,1.2993,4.6235,4.5983,4.3594,6.0293,0.2217,1.927,4.6621,1.1636,0.0031,0.3185,0.5973,2.0082,4.3312,4.3746,1.2235,2.6129,3.8484,2.3643,3.7934,1.5449,4.1451,2.9822,0.6623,2.3335,5.2477,0.5521,1.3875,4.5697,0.0006,5.9052,4.8287,5.4579,2.1425,5.1075,0.8017,0.6474,1.9762,0.7617,4.5177,2.1691,2.5244,4.985,2.0034,1.3963,1.5596,1.6699,2.1986,0.395,0.3558,2.0568,3.1321,2.1624,3.5037,4.4403,1.3236,4.6411,4.1979,3.2339,1.2688,0.3933,2.3759,3.5193,0.4597,2.5594,2.1843,2.8923,2.4863,3.4821,2.1288,3.2032,1.5052,3.5645,3.6678,6.2264,1.2902,3.6972,3.1576,2.3787,1.7299,1.2178,3.6752,2.5959,3.7533,1.0675,0.0708,2.9862,3.2602,2.1166,2.5669,0.7447,1.9065,1.8573,0.7108,0.9352,0.0022,0.0006,0.4059,0.1133,5.4055,1.9472,2.0487,0.5043,1.5893,6.051,0.2804,0.7126,3.9579,0.4691,3.8483,2.2895,2.8206,2.825,3.5876,0.8433,3.6483,2.4238,0.6828,2.8173,4.0092,2.8933,0.2518,0.6869,0.0002,4.9713,4.6465,2.0629,0.3964,1.1285,0.8813,0.0001,4.865,2.3802,1.5586,5.1862,4.6566,5.6409,1.4213,0.038,5.479,3.5778,2.2214,5.8748,3.9579,1.7506,3.8819,2.8461,2.8849,1.5188,0.004,0.0005,0.2962,0.1703,1.4569,4.2313,3.6623,0.1641,0.0863,3.1752,1.1808,5.0154,0.0957,5.4054,2.182,1.1189,0.0003,0.2699,1.4948,2.3826,0.1655,0.27,0.0847,1.4602,0.0002,5.3614,2.4301,0.3179,4.1183,5.9464,4.9206,6.6919,0.4891,2.479,5.7092,5.5077,0.8317,1.1532,1.0396,0.2238,1.2669,4.4896,5.7839,5.1113,0.4707,3.4304,5.8625,0.2506,0.0124,0.2645,1.1501,4.8385,4.2409,2.0537,0.0033,2.6778,0.3773,0.0076,1.9107,0.3569,0.4492,0.7624,2.8087,1.1413,1.7375,2.9021,2.3934,0.7136,3.4168,0.0307,5.7245,1.228,0.8692,2.3401,3.0161,4.647,6.0953,4.1014,1.593,0.0103,0.0003,1.1035,0.9029,0.0002,4.8405,3.0674,1.9363,2.5082,0.9328,2.69,1.2165,0.7739,6.1716,2.7483,2.131,0.6973,0.2685,0.1409,2.9633,5.0694,0.0973,0.0007,3.2171,1.2745,1.246,4.0203,2.6995,3.6077,4.1015,4.5531,2.1688,5.5803,2.7981,4.6786,2.5455,0.0306,2.0155,2.4987,0.0362,5.1616,0.3846,1.7463,2.4827,5.9798,0.9439,0.1687,1.0022,0.0002,4.0288,3.3364,2.0791,1.7995,0.2072,1.2877,0.7569,0.8275,7.3951,1.8403,3.7892,4.4166,0.1001,5.9373,3.9592,1.6623,0.3481,0.0001,5.5992,4.3639,2.2823,2.1596,0.0004,2.2469,6.2885,0.7232,1.3448,1.5839,1.1081,1.8566,1.2475,5.0775,1.4167,1.2312,1.0907,0.0001,1.2975,2.2463,2.0745,0.0003,1.007,2.9438,2.0908,2.2685,0.2167,0.7107,0.6418,2.2916,0.4284,3.2853,1.9245,2.5506,3.0966,0.9859,2.5933,2.483,1.1686,6.6259,0.0003,1.5955,1.3866,0.4306,3.7581,4.0623,1.669,5.8151,1.3028,3.6455,1.3557,0.2691,1.6157,3.5041,1.9241,0.5085,0.6559,0.0048,0.0005,0.1273,0.0461,1.0084,0.0002,2.7806,3.3371,3.3282,1.6865,5.5359,0.6098,0.1441,3.2332,2.6336,5.1944,1.7001,3.2733,0.0154,0.001,0.2907,0.727,1.6349,2.9707,2.4148,3.5057,4.2206,0.3361,3.7267,0.277,0.1548,6.4827,1.1235,0.2823,1.6173,1.9911,3.9372,2.0262,0.6587,2.5579,1.8156,4.6174,1.2604,4.2051,4.2064,3.9803,3.3571,0.9674,4.5388,4.1026,5.6544,1.5647,1.4795,1.5452,1.5687,4.2501,3.5074,0.0022,0.0007,2.4134,2.0158,1.6951,4.4774,0.0056,3.8844,1.6757,2.4418,1.0035,3.0979,1.1468,0.0922,2.0459,1.4664,4.8203,0.0028,0.0135,0.5544,6.2694,1.9987,3.1665,1.0832,0.0612,1.5466,6.0445,4.3034,1.081,0.8823,4.0099,0.0752,1.8753,6.1532,6.3923,1.5142,1.7048,2.0706,1.8749,2.2711,0.6006]}
{"id":741,"ended":false,"length":455,"gen_text":"Not only did the big oil companies know about global warming since the 80s, they have also been hunting time travelers sent from the future to invent clean technologies.\n\nIn fact, in the year since 2010, the United States has sent about 630 people to space. In 2008, the country sent 15 people to space. In 2009, the United States sent about 70 humans to space.\n\n\"With billions of dollars of private industry money coming and go, the US government wants us to have the tools, and resources, to make science and technology happen. So the United States government has taken the lead in promoting space exploration, which will drive up prices for US manufacturers,\" said Mr. LeVine, director of the Environmental Coalition at the Union of Concern Scientists, which is backing Mr. Obama.\n\nThe federal government can purchase a government-issued space-related spacecraft with little or no government scrutiny. The space industry can buy a space station that can carry astronauts. As part of its push to build space station technology, the government has approved about $1.7 billion of space tourism contracts. Space tourism contracts in the United States and abroad get about 18 percent of sales.\n\nThe last time the government stopped paying for space tourism was in 2002, when President Gordon G. Woodrow Wilson ordered the closing of the Kennedy Space Center in 1968, only to launch astronauts into space later that year.\n\nIn 2015, NASA sent a human to space aboard a Soyuz capsule but had to cancel it in response to a technical malfunction.\n\nThere hasn't been much interest in selling the commercial space shuttle. The Space Launch System (SLS), also known as Delta IV Heavy, went into commercial space aboard the shuttle Discovery on Sept. 6.

The opportunity to interview candidates can be difficult to evaluate because of the long wait for prospective hires. I know those are the candidates that have been asking me about this job, and have done an interview that is right for them. This is a great time for our group of volunteers.\n\nIt is a very good experience for us to hire people that can give their time and energy to these small, volunteer organizations we are working with. We understand that more than most of us, we are very fortunate to be looking for volunteers to work our small community. A great example of an organization that is truly dedicated to caring for a large group is Black Lives Matter, whose volunteer organization is trying to provide resources for an underserved group of homeless people in Atlanta, Georgia. They are working with the local Civil Rights and Veterans Coalition as a way to encourage local youth to have access to health insurance for themselves and\/or their families, as well as a number of other issues. This is not to say that they aren't talented, talented, or just plain wonderful members of their community, but they are the ones to give back. When your organization gets the chance (and experience) to start working on these issues for our community, you can look forward to doing this amazing business for them.\n\nAt the end of the day, we are here to serve that small community. As long as you stay motivated and committed, this work will get done, and our volunteers will continue to contribute to that work. The more you do, the more it will become a passion and motivation for this community I feel we are at the beginning stages of creating. We'll continue to keep your eyes peeled for additional opportunities to do this in the future, as well as looking to make that part of this business a priority over others. If it is time, it is.

{"id":2147,"ended":true,"length":473,"gen_text":"`` Every monster has a very potent weakness, generally something species-wide and a thing or two for each individual. Something they are weak to, or can't touch... or are afraid of. ''\n\nHowever, that list is long since deleted and replaced with something completely new, like something in which animals have been designed to feel more like human beings.\n\nWhen humans have tried to make themselves comfortable and safe using drugs, those drugs have been very ineffective.\n\nHow so? If we want to see what this will look like on a much less invasive computer, consider that if we actually were to make it much easier to have children we would be able to use all of the available resources that are available for doing so on a mass scale, rather than simply having children with one parent.\n\nFor any one or more of our needs, a large group could be able to do away with the need for some kind of parental intervention. In recent years, this has been happening with the new laws about \"reasonable mental, physical and emotional conditions.\"\n\nWhat happens after a child comes out?\n\nAt some point, parents might want to allow for a \"partial evaluation and treatment,\" so that doctors can then examine whether a child has a healthy, functioning brain. But until there is no physical proof of their condition, these treatments might be ineffective, like, for lack of a better word, medication.\n\nFinally...\n\nEven if we were able to go this far on the \"consent\" part of the law, it probably would not be a law that works as effectively without the child being a parent. What it would work for will only be if he or she were treated very effectively, if necessary, even then only for the time it takes to get to a doctor. So this part of the law is pretty hard to pull off, at least to me anyway. I am glad that my friend is now considering using the law to try to move ahead with her PhD.\n\nThere will surely be some groups who are going to oppose this. For one thing, it is going to be easier for any group or group of people to have any reasonable idea, or not even know, at least because we don't even have the technology to actually have any medical or parenting resources available.\n\nWhen you're not fighting for the rights of your children, you're just protecting yourself and your personal rights for your own protection.","token_len":495,"entropy":[9.6382,7.3939,1.7566,1.2281,5.8801,7.3142,4.9446,1.9637,8.216,7.1036,12.5899,0.9363,3.9304,3.1485,4.5903,6.4757,4.3465,0.1403,5.42,2.8057,4.0232,1.003,7.1093,5.2194,3.1873,3.1271,0.6586,1.6402,2.2438,4.7737,0.5087,6.9801,5.0613,3.6924,3.7898,3.2214,0.4126,0.7981,9.7257,3.0927,0.0665,6.2718,0.1523,4.8698,5.0751,1.6397,3.4387,5.4826,4.7923,2.889,2.9957,0.5758,2.7134,4.4045,1.1303,1.5507,3.2104,4.3355,4.8178,2.8858,6.1189,2.0981,2.54,5.0674,0.9248,4.5824,3.6184,1.5514,2.3546,0.6171,1.1318,1.5018,0.0004,4.8007,5.1496,3.4034,5.3413,0.3494,3.3452,3.1336,5.7854,2.7352,2.8219,4.1917,3.8827,0.7627,5.5245,1.5758,0.8561,1.3435,3.3308,3.9194,0.7724,1.4413,0.0003,5.8252,5.9106,0.1431,5.0438,3.1166,3.2429,0.3507,4.2945,2.5978,3.9993,4.605,1.2967,0.0024,3.7665,1.3677,4.9907,5.4995,4.0776,5.1567,1.108,5.4383,3.136,4.1516,1.3538,5.2787,4.9425,1.0211,2.7801,2.7078,4.6985,1.3363,0.9513,4.569,3.7708,3.9303,1.3177,2.0267,0.4314,0.0159,3.8693,4.141,1.3378,1.1304,4.5016,2.8841,3.6067,2.5128,0.2754,2.0737,4.3422,0.6472,4.4566,0.927,5.9036,0.0259,2.0383,2.9081,0.0144,3.2983,2.7167,3.4419,3.5282,3.6714,2.1183,1.0839,0.5615,0.0004,4.4402,5.8533,4.8847,4.9039,1.4363,1.1386,3.1492,4.0284,0.4614,4.313,3.955,3.5123,3.5803,1.7015,2.0499,0.0137,2.8079,6.1499,0.0054,1.5938,1.5274,0.4034,4.8188,1.8769,0.0035,2.8169,2.2686,0.9831,3.8116,6.7802,0.4324,0.736,2.6912,0.4292,1.2174,3.8514,2.2268,1.6334,5.0202,5.5041,3.3607,3.7252,5.7963,6.2161,4.7342,0.8386,0.9194,0.4879,4.4886,2.5937,0.8669,0.0004,3.7134,4.1237,4.3698,2.0426,1.2088,3.9145,1.1923,0.9578,1.1479,0.0002,4.5299,1.8341,0.0405,0.7093,3.4277,3.9152,2.2838,0.1714,5.3197,4.5164,1.6381,3.3775,6.0067,5.4412,4.9243,3.4784,2.7724,3.6237,0.482,4.3401,0.4671,4.1742,5.0798,4.2525,2.1729,0.3013,1.6256,1.9417,5.6794,2.0654,2.5976,0.4942,0.8792,2.9858,4.8548,4.0129,0.4602,3.539,5.2201,3.4979,1.0725,4.3418,2.5064,0.3537,4.0818,2.6958,3.1205,1.8682,2.1841,2.0736,5.0315,4.6854,2.2767,8.498,0.0031,0.4853,0.0116,0.3433,0.1002,6.0213,0.5573,0.344,0.0003,5.4816,4.9646,1.1132,0.0002,4.4104,0.7536,2.1672,2.8007,1.5552,0.0159,5.1355,4.5666,0.6942,4.1142,1.7291,4.0146,5.5724,1.9457,0.8514,2.3652,0.8599,0.8713,3.3313,0.2017,1.7735,5.3323,1.903,1.3465,0.8851,2.551,3.9105,1.012,5.02,2.9836,3.0088,4.8564,2.1744,5.0112,2.0763,2.9665,1.7692,0.3966,5.1351,2.7585,1.0289,3.7172,3.0613,6.291,5.1185,0.724,2.7798,6.2746,0.9183,0.004,2.8939,4.6555,4.6954,2.9382,1.6729,4.3535,5.7638,0.6103,4.1935,5.7538,5.2092,2.1428,2.1405,2.1856,2.6354,0.3817,0.978,1.9204,2.3688,1.4827,1.2466,0.7759,4.3044,4.092,5.3725,0.4232,0.1236,0.2073,1.5517,3.4172,4.6133,0.1375,4.3631,0.0313,1.7087,3.744,0.1585,3.2547,0.9382,4.984,0.2492,3.5817,3.6066,4.7102,1.1942,4.0086,3.1275,2.8557,3.6786,4.6962,4.2334,1.8289,1.4155,0.9363,2.5164,0.7688,5.6544,4.0295,0.7007,2.6165,5.7832,1.6716,0.8035,0.0005,4.507,3.842,5.0077,0.1595,1.6739,5.3489,1.6483,2.3088,2.7131,0.0721,4.0358,1.1769,2.3222,3.8762,2.4502,0.2056,0.0634,2.2892,1.9494,4.0137,0.0105,0.6943,4.7155,0.6974,5.6158,1.7918,4.4996,2.008,0.4134,0.3941,0.3604,3.0981,5.1249,5.679,2.5589,4.6262,2.3903,5.5164,2.0549,1.5974,0.6747,5.2341,1.8606,5.6016,2.8365,2.7301,0.0006,3.7727,0.8514,2.2871,3.9861,0.5661,3.4419,3.4293,2.7107,4.9399,3.3507,5.5878,5.0545,1.0179,1.1294,1.0278,0.0004,5.7519,2.4087,3.322,3.7801,5.5683,1.6716,1.7004,1.22,0.1022,2.2437,1.2972,0.4864,1.2746,0.598,3.9497,5.4965,2.9621,2.1942,0.6588,4.9634,3.8202,4.8568,2.1483,0.4098,4.1162,0.3219]}

The judge ordered jurors to hear oral arguments and make up their own minds on how to vote.\n\nLawyers representing the men said that while the verdict is disappointing, those involved would be disappointed if the outcome were reversed after finding that the jurors were deprived of their right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\nMr Jaffra said he was \"very pleased\" with the court's decision. On the other hand, he said, the legal costs would be substantial. Several civil suits have since been filed, with a majority of the state's defendants claiming that the jury failed to properly consider a number of legal issues while they deliberated in the courthouse.\n\n\"The outcome of its recent verdict, while disappointing, is no less than the conclusion of the court, and there is no doubt that we now have a case that will have some impact upon the future of this district,\" Mr Jaffra said.\n\nLawyer Andrew Jones, representing the third plaintiff, who is from Sydney, said his clients had been \"shocked\" by the verdict and asked for help through the Coalition's appeal. The lawyer believes the public will still be entitled to jury trials under the current system where the jury has been used to determine a person's claim.\n\n\"The public may be surprised by this law because it could provide the public with many more important details that might have been disclosed in our previous ruling, such as the right of a jury to hear oral arguments before either party is represented,\" the lawyer said.\n\nThe case, originally heard this month in Victoria, is expected to take several years to have an opportunity to be heard. A spokeswoman for Mr Jaffra said the case was being pursued for a period of time so there was not enough time for consideration of the outcome.\n\nWhile the trial judge was happy with the decision, the jury still wanted more information about Mr Jaffra's client's case, she said.\n\n\"There's absolutely something the public would want in the court papers about that case,\" she said.\n\nThe jury, which includes nearly 80 per cent of Aboriginal people, has had one hearing in the year to November next year, Ms Sykes said.\n\n\"We're hoping to get to a point where the first hearing will be in early 2014,\" Ms Sykes said.","token_len":496,"entropy":[7.3022,3.3171,9.6812,1.2864,5.5955,0.8673,3.1916,4.3809,4.2653,5.5215,1.9548,3.0689,5.853,3.516,4.1909,4.8624,2.2063,3.2576,0.0497,1.3338,2.059,3.9962,0.9317,2.7301,1.8104,3.4216,3.0952,0.3847,4.7952,4.4461,0.0713,3.085,4.5545,2.5067,0.1713,0.4468,2.7557,1.9763,3.3886,0.7265,2.8064,0.7216,1.5552,0.0004,5.6409,0.2533,2.3072,1.0531,4.2924,1.4977,2.6312,2.8058,1.2402,2.6381,2.5725,3.5799,0.2705,6.7781,3.0708,4.5003,2.0242,3.645,0.9006,1.0113,4.6269,2.4421,0.311,5.9165,6.1229,0.9052,1.0356,2.9542,1.7544,5.0366,0.0492,0.8181,0.7805,0.0301,1.9149,0.2972,2.1538,0.4623,1.2854,0.4446,0.2447,0.0003,4.3148,5.3629,4.384,5.2667,0.9418,2.237,1.3792,1.882,2.3409,2.0004,0.2991,1.3009,0.1363,3.621,0.1594,0.4641,0.8829,7.6609,2.0494,1.3185,0.0851,0.0199,0.492,0.4848,1.8079,1.5271,5.1561,4.3574,1.9253,0.4668,2.7582,0.7888,8.2045,6.0232,1.42,1.5225,5.6867,0.1276,0.7854,2.1092,3.6912,3.0203,4.6486,0.2827,0.8582,5.2861,0.7504,5.2878,3.0955,1.6913,0.7911,2.4919,4.5191,0.1459,2.5376,0.9041,3.3226,2.3707,0.0011,4.6235,0.891,6.4939,2.9478,0.6956,0.0188,3.2055,0.7636,3.8989,0.2685,0.3018,0.0002,1.8036,1.8657,4.2416,0.8602,7.2384,5.8648,2.9263,3.2055,3.6887,1.7479,0.3,0.9083,4.4399,1.2901,2.5511,1.4411,3.6839,0.8875,1.2626,3.5492,3.2294,1.2528,4.53,0.6758,0.5992,1.6978,0.5147,3.8408,4.8318,0.3607,0.812,3.4076,1.2403,1.6791,2.7348,4.9823,1.7389,3.2637,0.8967,2.6696,0.2147,2.0543,4.5245,0.4449,0.8443,0.095,0.0017,0.0022,0.1205,0.2269,0.3965,0.0002,4.8608,2.7424,4.7338,5.4986,0.9819,0.6638,1.0158,5.3843,2.1435,0.2287,4.482,1.5091,3.7113,4.1945,0.3632,0.3511,3.0768,1.9735,1.4107,1.3087,2.6472,3.2867,0.1079,0.9739,0.6826,0.1502,0.9999,1.6482,5.0665,1.3765,5.5673,5.4871,0.9779,4.946,1.2019,3.812,0.9305,3.6807,3.2709,6.8686,1.0946,5.7522,2.8505,4.1952,1.1396,3.8949,0.0049,5.4233,2.8913,3.7996,0.714,3.2326,1.0942,4.9286,1.7369,2.4835,2.8061,2.5529,5.4836,0.858,1.9781,2.1623,2.5751,0.0084,6.6859,1.4751,0.2682,0.0002,1.1081,1.8732,3.3136,4.7279,1.9567,3.4829,1.9253,2.2489,6.4855,3.2899,0.9882,4.6226,5.1478,2.7226,2.8568,0.2445,5.5371,1.1892,3.3978,5.1198,2.9962,3.8915,2.0473,1.0219,5.8139,1.6134,4.8207,1.517,3.2922,2.0454,1.3566,0.0016,1.1293,4.9136,2.1926,1.4913,1.195,0.1743,1.7734,1.4045,0.0892,3.0114,6.1822,3.4526,3.2961,4.8112,1.5258,4.5732,0.0729,0.1367,0.0585,0.3979,0.0002,1.8606,3.3047,3.0037,5.4339,2.2624,5.9223,1.3708,1.4771,4.5881,0.7232,1.7164,3.2944,0.007,3.1782,3.123,1.0698,0.1958,5.718,3.2392,1.5801,0.2073,1.2533,0.1647,1.4552,3.3377,4.1687,0.0691,3.0653,0.5264,0.0019,0.0074,0.3569,1.1092,2.8668,1.1262,2.1755,3.6124,3.384,2.0571,3.9462,0.1272,1.2043,4.8276,3.4573,0.6607,2.4644,1.2764,0.0801,1.1392,5.1644,0.971,1.413,3.838,0.5109,0.5636,0.0002,5.5762,1.0255,2.7401,3.2136,2.9454,4.9835,0.3844,0.1944,2.024,0.4178,2.1089,3.3218,4.5943,5.2404,3.2498,0.958,1.0681,2.093,0.214,0.0008,0.0081,0.5848,2.9218,1.4554,2.231,1.4999,2.4991,0.2236,0.0852,0.6305,0.0002,1.0139,2.9845,2.6971,5.3291,4.9717,5.8595,0.9563,3.5526,2.2339,4.3496,1.5797,4.8505,3.7653,3.3356,3.8976,1.3789,0.8927,1.3389,0.0447,0.044,0.7559,0.0002,1.9965,3.2671,3.1574,1.045,3.1657,5.4078,3.9748,2.5185,0.0001,0.537,5.5035,1.4396,0.7433,2.5592,4.1177,5.1615,3.0987,1.6553,1.222,5.1038,1.9176,2.9496,4.3026,0.0403,1.3425,3.0919,6.2631,2.2344,0.0693,0.0825,0.6907,0.0002,1.5554,1.9342,1.5178,2.6212,1.9378,1.811,2.962,1.9696,2.3283,0.1672,1.7262,5.7131,1.8267,1.5284,0.715,1.6666,3.2046,3.1118,1.3009,1.3394,0.0095,0.0001,0.0413,0.0579]}
{"id":1220,"ended":true,"length":475,"gen_text":"A superhero whose power is that they will always save the day in the most absurd and improbable way possible... but one that makes the world feel as if everything goes better.\n\nThe fact is, with all the things I have written above, the way superheroes play to the story's core is as interesting and complex as ever. They are not really superheroes\u2014they are simply things that matter and deserve the attention.\n\nIt is a truth about superheroes\u2014about us, about the world we live in and the world that drives us to fight. The power of the comic books makes us feel like a part of the action. I would love to see stories like these, with a strong hero who will come to save us or fight back... but the more I think about it the more it feels like I won't see it because I can't remember where I started from, why and how I can get my hands on that character again. I want to feel like my heroes have helped so many of the other world's heroes in good times, hurt so many of them in bad... so many of the world's heroes are just too dumb to fight for them when they are trying to save others\u2014which is why these characters often die in battles. The comic book world can be sad and tragic and funny but is rarely a scary place.\n\nBut the comic book universe is no more. There is life there but there is no more death. When people see that the world they live in is far more dangerous than it gets, like a real-life comic-book film, the very reality that comes after them, and that can cause a lot of sadness on our part, makes this story much more fascinating and more intriguing than a typical television show.\n\nI don't think I have a bad feeling about my comic books\u2014a sense that they won't make me happy for the rest of my life\u2014but I am pretty happy that it doesn't feel like comic book culture is going to change, if any, or that these things matter. If I want to see superheroes that will take back my home, something I can live with and save, and if I want to live with superheroes that will take back my whole world, I guess this will be a good place. But I'll give them a hard time and hope that someday a new age comes where they all make their difference and do what we need to do to help make the world a better place.","token_len":497,"entropy":[11.3888,6.3479,4.2951,1.4503,4.942,5.5092,3.7447,3.3168,4.7704,1.245,0.8961,5.0753,1.4418,4.1807,6.6647,2.4498,5.6248,1.293,0.8856,4.7239,3.1654,4.8239,1.4605,4.2274,2.6486,1.243,4.2549,3.3658,0.7381,3.8323,4.9637,5.183,2.5797,1.3657,0.0335,2.7354,5.4513,1.8216,0.7357,5.1411,2.7784,0.9164,5.269,3.0897,2.9077,2.1896,3.545,0.3805,2.4981,4.8803,5.1239,4.4815,5.8642,2.4389,4.098,1.6878,2.5917,0.8587,4.7842,4.0872,1.3306,3.6299,0.09,3.0873,0.2491,3.3437,1.4567,2.8911,5.7007,2.265,5.5045,0.614,0.3894,3.8371,5.3976,0.7369,4.2574,3.0181,3.8121,3.4689,1.3192,2.6931,1.7519,0.0002,3.8799,1.4019,2.53,5.5384,4.7623,1.7483,4.4768,5.4306,5.2249,1.5498,0.8947,1.6784,0.4527,2.5641,0.1407,0.0128,1.9914,1.491,2.3918,1.221,5.6251,0.5795,1.0806,3.416,1.715,3.3246,4.8028,0.6957,2.0033,3.4199,1.7507,3.7947,2.151,2.165,1.39,2.9923,2.0286,0.0037,1.7395,4.7725,1.4355,4.2764,4.1684,2.0869,0.2341,0.5061,5.5169,0.9511,2.909,2.9322,3.6225,2.5725,4.0969,4.1459,2.1596,3.3873,5.0168,1.3245,1.5884,1.4993,3.5646,3.8185,2.5533,5.8535,0.5561,2.8588,4.0996,1.2758,1.4716,0.0518,0.8303,2.7356,0.1106,2.4427,1.8491,0.246,2.0462,6.7066,0.0233,2.2877,2.1747,4.827,1.0644,3.217,0.1162,4.3266,3.1065,0.6172,2.5462,3.0449,2.3346,4.465,4.8656,0.9965,0.8949,5.5697,2.517,3.6056,0.946,0.0624,3.2789,3.8988,4.1549,0.3531,2.6915,3.3433,0.5075,3.5735,0.6546,3.8352,2.5246,2.3062,4.7365,5.1824,0.1175,3.1839,2.4512,3.7303,4.1815,0.3268,1.1488,3.0904,6.4465,0.8508,2.2423,5.9561,0.6441,0.0616,0.7959,0.9296,1.929,0.07,2.0685,3.1369,3.2116,1.69,1.6056,1.7714,0.0089,0.2976,2.077,2.8177,3.1033,5.5007,0.5452,4.4965,2.259,2.0779,4.9119,0.7138,2.227,4.4264,0.3351,0.8638,2.7759,5.034,4.3396,0.8284,1.7019,4.7731,2.4629,4.6961,4.2699,1.8128,4.7665,1.6618,3.5098,2.7052,1.1638,1.9251,3.8888,1.064,5.9803,1.0915,3.8338,1.086,4.7596,3.2357,4.8003,5.1537,2.7541,6.3177,0.206,0.8565,1.0232,0.0002,3.7806,2.481,2.3764,0.8649,3.9212,0.9441,5.4379,3.1776,1.9559,3.162,0.8295,6.8348,3.43,3.6376,1.7947,0.3419,1.1498,4.2516,5.7579,0.7616,5.067,3.9811,3.3785,2.7227,2.9111,0.9742,3.3223,0.2816,0.0119,0.4811,5.3982,1.3723,1.9285,0.558,1.7267,7.1171,0.4967,6.2469,2.7926,5.2319,2.8118,0.0809,5.6707,3.667,0.0159,6.4209,0.9448,3.0306,5.6953,4.6235,1.7676,5.2279,3.2242,2.7546,3.3461,2.4807,2.0462,4.8722,3.4306,2.4206,1.1291,0.0247,5.328,5.857,4.8516,1.0141,0.7293,2.3352,3.9393,2.7894,3.8284,0.4239,5.2942,1.4015,2.7886,5.1888,1.6557,4.3807,3.2463,6.2732,0.7173,0.5337,0.7724,0.0002,2.3659,3.417,0.0009,1.509,1.9051,1.7141,2.71,3.5317,1.6582,0.1527,4.7341,2.848,1.435,2.3613,5.2928,4.4344,0.9389,1.4798,6.2273,0.003,2.7312,0.5939,2.8881,4.3788,1.6302,0.5658,0.0005,0.0692,0.0308,2.5573,0.2684,0.8224,2.4387,4.5498,3.4249,1.3321,3.9173,3.4402,0.0009,2.5293,0.4045,6.2577,1.3911,4.8126,1.6122,3.2832,0.4554,1.9145,3.465,4.6861,4.243,1.206,3.5192,1.4814,5.1402,3.2085,4.0782,1.1436,3.6418,1.802,3.5052,0.3686,1.7959,2.5099,3.6668,2.4461,3.8801,4.564,3.1227,3.3497,0.981,6.3004,1.5849,2.7766,3.5343,0.9662,2.102,5.2342,1.1947,3.1484,2.6661,0.2937,0.1919,0.2949,3.5935,2.0137,2.8847,0.3356,0.429,2.8109,1.0358,0.5307,5.3815,0.465,0.3976,0.9585,5.961,3.588,2.6759,0.8397,1.7648,1.3894,1.3514,2.6625,2.5327,1.2894,4.8321,4.7762,2.2793,1.0781,3.1335,0.0964,3.4968,2.4418,0.8259,3.8642,4.7385,2.4392,5.481,2.6388,4.6227,1.2108,3.9127,4.0039,3.3084,6.5461,1.9431,4.0206,1.6655,3.027,1.9209,1.6189,0.0761,0.7848,2.3846,3.8605,1.1565,0.1102,0.8318,0.129,0.023,0.3788]}

{"id":843,"ended":true,"length":487,"gen_text":"Freddy Kreuger deeply regrets entering the dreams of his latest intended victim - The Joker, played by Mark Waid - and will not be pleased to lose sight of how his dream has come to mean he would spend the next eighteen months chasing Gotham City.\n\n\"The Joker\" played by Mark Waid is based on the Joker from the original movie of the same name and shows up in the movie's climax in the first issue. He's still living at the beginning of the story but is getting a new head, and being a vigilante. On top of all that, he's a very, very strange character. As for the way that he killed Batman with a flash bullet, what we don't know is what he did with what appears to be a knife while in the same issue he is trying to murder the Gotham police officer, who died in the Joker's custody. We never get any information about it, so there's no way to tell if he's a really, really weird character.\n\nAs a part of what made the creation of this story so special, it was very refreshing to have a story that was so close to the events of the comic book. From the moment we began the story, there was no writing in the book, which was so refreshing because we only started with what I love... comic books. We just started writing the story, and I had always done that because I thought the comic book was a perfect fit because it was that perfect as well. Even after three issues it was easy to get to the end, and we're just glad that the art style is so good and, by the time the final issue comes out on February 21, there will probably be a few more issues. One issue, which is where we are now in the final story of this story is the first part. No secret that you will be picking up one issues for this new series will feature a story like this coming out. There is one issue per comic book, so it may be just a few for the next half-dozen issues. We want to continue to get more from this new series, and the story will continue in the second issue. This isn't what I've been talking about before, but it's one of the ways we're excited about this one.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the art style of this character now? Are you looking forward to more updates or simply enjoying the first issue? Let us know in the comments.","token_len":500,"entropy":[8.2713,6.7043,3.7646,0.1076,13.473,1.4901,8.1099,0.6807,12.4304,0.2974,1.269,8.421,10.7566,2.0563,5.2693,5.334,4.0351,1.9592,5.0461,0.0243,4.5633,1.6213,0.3967,2.4498,1.2452,3.6588,2.6094,0.9439,5.0575,0.8932,4.3941,5.2143,0.0054,4.1283,2.5202,4.9338,2.4113,3.4632,0.7972,3.9553,2.5563,4.552,6.2846,1.4276,1.9357,5.6104,0.9013,5.5664,5.5081,1.3529,2.5455,1.2669,0.0061,2.4475,2.9141,1.2999,4.1738,6.0583,0.1556,0.3762,0.0249,0.0003,1.7381,3.8991,0.131,0.741,3.5121,1.4386,0.8852,3.1905,3.9857,4.1887,0.1168,0.0127,0.0233,2.4213,6.0927,1.7607,0.7544,1.3568,3.7752,1.8487,3.2873,2.0123,1.2479,3.4485,3.8298,1.3688,2.5803,2.7948,5.4537,4.7231,2.7024,0.9009,5.118,0.166,0.5794,1.3751,2.4035,2.2294,5.1007,2.7411,1.45,4.9087,2.863,1.9112,5.1861,2.521,4.3322,1.8617,6.0739,2.3953,0.0007,2.7451,0.8033,0.3028,0.9268,0.933,2.8388,3.6492,4.325,0.0121,4.5922,1.9028,0.9538,4.48,3.4334,1.3091,5.7245,2.3666,0.791,5.3628,3.098,6.2504,1.8683,5.3076,5.7711,0.5478,5.3338,3.5566,3.3298,0.0006,0.1868,0.3641,1.6134,1.6965,1.5204,1.3231,6.1122,5.2526,0.0684,0.0782,0.8968,5.8122,6.1343,2.3524,0.9287,4.3714,2.9072,4.2266,3.4794,3.9017,0.0321,5.095,2.0719,5.4876,2.2122,1.6272,2.1271,2.7293,5.8123,1.3278,0.8559,4.9018,0.086,4.2146,0.506,3.2477,3.8202,2.1393,2.8127,1.7911,0.9874,4.5856,1.2842,2.8456,3.2208,0.7717,0.8743,0.9213,0.7467,1.7139,2.2315,1.7816,1.8006,2.4966,5.659,3.9347,0.0269,3.7113,1.0906,1.7539,0.7606,0.0002,3.9003,3.1627,4.5493,0.0191,4.2383,4.5391,1.201,6.4681,0.0666,1.955,1.8219,0.6933,1.563,0.617,2.4278,1.3592,4.0261,5.6009,0.1943,2.3402,1.8201,3.0154,0.9518,1.8632,1.5129,4.6283,0.1125,1.0285,4.6599,0.3039,0.4467,3.206,0.8649,1.5595,5.3527,0.7877,2.8714,1.5257,3.9804,1.9384,0.7124,0.4916,2.662,0.7037,1.8358,5.973,2.959,0.6688,1.9671,1.6738,3.7054,1.3562,4.9846,3.109,2.4457,1.8285,5.7231,3.5441,2.127,3.722,3.9319,5.4337,7.6367,5.16,0.5725,0.4938,2.7132,3.4832,1.6852,2.8279,1.8947,1.1313,2.1263,0.7595,2.2856,3.7182,4.9429,4.2847,0.8911,3.7853,0.6224,3.3654,2.6837,2.5367,0.7469,1.0604,2.4194,3.9171,1.5888,4.3379,1.0519,1.0372,5.463,3.6693,5.4555,1.3809,0.3656,5.5006,3.2675,5.7146,0.9599,3.383,1.0849,5.5356,0.3867,2.1194,3.1934,1.3125,2.3182,2.0692,1.2167,2.9878,3.7469,2.8029,2.6075,1.1389,2.7141,5.2873,2.938,1.9215,1.7932,1.9356,2.0896,6.5845,4.2228,0.3443,3.336,2.1197,2.385,0.5165,1.359,0.2818,4.3003,3.2788,3.6494,1.4409,2.9079,0.8517,3.3985,0.3137,1.6704,3.0771,1.1748,0.5884,1.8275,6.1002,2.6272,3.1035,3.3614,1.4312,4.7644,1.1825,3.0553,1.755,2.6969,0.7939,3.4906,3.5702,3.1561,3.1411,1.2542,4.7414,1.8749,2.5509,3.8614,2.5786,6.178,6.2442,2.7345,5.0138,2.885,1.99,5.7947,0.0944,4.3274,6.3448,4.4198,2.7252,4.2302,1.8453,6.0274,6.2759,1.8679,3.4675,3.6755,0.4644,5.431,0.4412,2.1537,3.7125,1.8751,3.3954,1.1995,5.3171,3.2494,0.7797,1.3255,1.9571,2.5257,4.5901,1.366,4.3807,1.6887,1.347,4.797,1.5742,2.6404,5.9968,1.8761,1.0945,0.6914,0.6598,2.7467,4.1388,0.3342,4.0261,0.8095,3.4336,2.1996,4.8442,1.2056,3.049,0.4838,1.2463,0.8565,3.4484,3.2309,1.7338,1.659,4.0108,1.5244,4.1893,0.8974,1.1711,4.1727,5.0344,0.0005,5.2569,1.5263,3.1727,0.8653,3.5042,0.0091,1.8935,0.604,0.6766,1.7862,0.9583,3.9134,0.5811,0.823,4.7774,1.8581,1.6272,5.4729,0.7856,1.3897,4.5714,0.5353,0.6941,0.0001,3.1656,2.0674,0.565,0.4235,0.2086,0.859,4.2266,0.7989,0.6472,1.1423,4.1267,5.5819,1.1307,2.953,0.5772,2.4553,0.1188,0.0227,3.2739,6.1504,2.7919,5.8156,3.6764,0.868,4.3603,0.7314,0.9356,1.3925,0.0743,0.0023,0.4837,0.0085,0.0571,2.105]}
{"id":545,"ended":true,"length":476,"gen_text":"Describe a battle between your immune system and a foreign invader as a gritty war story from the POV of either side, played over one or more of the game's main characters. The combatants are primarily male-based, with one character from each side having a specific role in the battle to play. The narrative centers around your character's struggles against the threat of an alien invader, or her ability to withstand and overcome resistance to a particular type of disease.\n\nEach of the three characters is unique and unique, but you're given your own unique background. The aliens play with two unique types of health. You gain health and have a chance to get a certain way by interacting with them with your own skill. Your abilities include: healing your body by attacking with long attacks, making your body faster to heal, giving you invigorated reflexes, saving your heart for emergencies, and gaining immunity to certain diseases. You can also get stronger, and eventually lose the ability to die, which is a massive turn-off during the game.\n\nWhile combat may be the most frustrating portion of the game, having your character battle against alien invaders just feels like fun and entertainment. Unlike in previous games (like Mass Effect 2), where you've got to keep attacking aliens to defeat them, the story is a great outlet for exploring your characters. It's a fun place to learn new information without doing repetitive and repetitive actions.\n\nMass Effect's combat system is extremely reminiscent of old-school action games like Super Mario Bros. or Metal Gear Solid. The main character you fight will only attack and attack as you progress through the game, using items and upgrades that only serve the main character.\n\nThe combat in Mass Effect 2 is pretty similar to other action games like Mass Effect and Mass Effect: Infiltrator.

{"id":4615,"ended":true,"length":476,"gen_text":"Describe a battle between your immune system and a foreign invader as a gritty war story from the POV of either side, played over one or more of the game's main characters. The combatants are primarily male-based, with one character from each side having a specific role in the battle to play. The narrative centers around your character's struggles against the threat of an alien invader, or her ability to withstand and overcome resistance to a particular type of disease.\n\nEach of the three characters is unique and unique, but you're given your own unique background. The aliens play with two unique types of health. You gain health and have a chance to get a certain way by interacting with them with your own skill. Your abilities include: healing your body by attacking with long attacks, making your body faster to heal, giving you invigorated reflexes, saving your heart for emergencies, and gaining immunity to certain diseases. You can also get stronger, and eventually lose the ability to die, which is a massive turn-off during the game.\n\nWhile combat may be the most frustrating portion of the game, having your character battle against alien invaders just feels like fun and entertainment. Unlike in previous games (like Mass Effect 2), where you've got to keep attacking aliens to defeat them, the story is a great outlet for exploring your characters. It's a fun place to learn new information without doing repetitive and repetitive actions.\n\nMass Effect's combat system is extremely reminiscent of old-school action games like Super Mario Bros. or Metal Gear Solid. The main character you fight will only attack and attack as you progress through the game, using items and upgrades that only serve the main character.\n\nThe combat in Mass Effect 2 is pretty similar to other action games like Mass Effect and Mass Effect: Infiltrator. Unlike the previous games, the game has an overarching storyline that emphasizes how different you are from those fighting in the previous games. All of the characters are unique, but the core mechanics can only be fully developed over the course of a game. The combat can be complicated, tedious, and, in my opinion, a bit uninspired.\n\nIt's clear that Mass Effect 2 isn't getting any better with its story and mechanics, but the original Mass Effect 2 was a great experience for fans of modern video games.

For every bit of you we give back.\n\nI cannot express how heart deflating and joyful that day, I couldn't have dreamed that I would be there to help you, to take care of you. Thank you.","token_len":501,"entropy":[6.4831,5.2233,2.2086,6.3775,12.5195,0.4283,1.3088,1.4153,6.9147,1.3755,5.0267,0.8093,3.7995,7.1272,3.9279,0.4055,3.6681,2.6563,8.9454,1.0132,2.3591,0.0142,4.7702,5.1792,2.3849,3.7505,1.474,5.1114,2.1166,1.3091,1.2761,3.173,1.6383,3.1369,3.1093,5.5489,4.2673,0.964,1.7124,0.56,0.8662,5.5615,4.289,0.6639,2.1906,4.3018,0.7713,0.8443,6.8748,2.3846,1.1009,0.0001,4.3921,6.1638,3.3568,0.0407,5.7899,0.1832,3.1184,3.0064,5.342,2.04,0.5257,2.5913,0.0002,2.7675,3.0861,3.1919,0.885,3.8877,2.0495,4.3439,5.9108,5.4852,0.0063,0.1671,0.6804,0.0001,2.3828,4.3916,1.2997,4.3251,6.3642,2.7098,3.044,0.979,3.4681,2.7483,4.559,0.3492,0.0002,1.8315,5.775,2.1838,3.4154,1.7426,2.9249,0.6812,2.2933,4.014,0.6347,2.7647,3.7357,1.0234,2.8549,2.1129,0.4796,3.878,2.99,3.6328,2.4514,0.0219,1.1616,3.8772,3.3716,0.5446,4.3406,0.5249,0.4676,0.0002,1.7233,3.6053,3.0727,3.4202,1.5422,1.1447,0.0002,3.9485,1.3563,2.4656,1.163,2.6445,0.1542,5.8955,1.1024,0.318,0.0002,2.3846,4.9224,2.2266,4.6004,3.1494,2.2917,0.43,0.551,3.837,3.1743,5.9135,5.1387,4.7453,2.455,3.7916,1.6665,1.1897,2.3923,2.3499,5.0339,4.2034,0.0758,3.9266,3.2303,3.5417,2.459,2.9188,0.5635,4.1193,0.9494,4.1775,1.1966,2.0663,5.9524,4.9974,1.3507,1.8749,2.0646,3.6604,2.9284,5.8443,1.867,1.8506,1.9184,2.6819,0.5311,0.4886,0.0002,1.6964,5.4892,1.8884,6.4059,3.2376,2.4912,4.2266,1.1137,1.9004,2.7634,0.7502,0.2821,0.8033,0.8502,0.0001,0.8082,3.8956,4.9974,3.8246,0.3791,0.6683,0.6625,3.6478,0.3454,0.0001,4.838,1.9573,5.3364,2.2235,0.4896,0.3635,0.0001,1.1683,4.718,0.9444,5.713,2.8678,5.5842,5.2129,1.3848,2.1229,0.1871,0.4077,0.2144,0.0001,0.6782,5.0335,1.9721,2.0186,2.4672,4.4307,1.136,0.177,0.0001,2.6321,4.8382,1.4614,4.9141,1.2978,0.1298,0.0001,0.8754,2.0706,4.303,2.3347,0.4705,1.8096,0.2503,0.1103,0.0001,2.2113,4.2523,3.4535,5.0225,3.9496,0.203,0.7886,2.7767,0.421,0.1246,0.0001,2.0263,3.2041,2.8547,2.2726,2.9061,5.5436,2.1111,2.4379,5.9255,1.1981,0.3856,1.3468,0.2101,0.0001,2.445,4.9861,0.3842,6.5132,2.3617,3.0964,3.0364,2.7647,2.7278,7.1408,3.4984,1.8206,3.3769,5.6817,3.6492,3.1184,0.8009,2.7842,3.1672,4.1384,1.0634,1.7084,0.4103,3.6605,3.9556,0.2971,0.3624,0.0001,2.9315,2.4777,0.9611,0.5276,3.566,5.0995,1.992,0.4736,0.3109,0.0001,1.7675,4.3931,2.2119,4.8976,1.3346,2.7186,0.7517,3.3807,0.3745,5.1914,1.0042,3.3436,3.753,1.5321,1.0516,2.4611,4.2598,5.2383,1.1937,1.8355,1.6243,1.476,4.2361,3.7905,4.1585,0.6435,4.0008,3.7884,5.2422,0.7376,0.3422,0.0001,4.6794,6.3603,5.4367,0.7683,2.839,3.8089,4.1068,6.0839,4.6797,1.8784,2.2733,2.0366,1.9102,6.1673,2.5683,1.5144,5.28,0.6577,5.6225,0.8412,0.4141,0.3838,0.0001,3.1142,0.0734,1.2919,1.7284,4.4377,0.9035,6.5871,1.5906,3.276,0.8752,2.2558,2.3763,0.8456,0.8642,0.8423,1.0315,2.7677,2.6646,7.1497,1.9216,5.3648,3.8082,2.7781,2.2473,4.371,5.817,5.2249,3.2277,4.4838,0.833,3.4039,2.538,1.4107,3.991,1.7328,1.4673,0.3602,0.1947,0.332,0.0001,5.5024,2.2449,1.3626,5.3297,1.7086,2.5283,2.5062,3.1827,1.823,3.6676,1.9763,1.5976,1.382,1.1838,0.7513,2.2019,0.9574,2.2006,1.6146,3.5251,3.7377,5.7616,2.8274,2.0838,2.969,0.3942,0.2977,0.0002,3.3026,1.5424,4.6537,0.9015,1.3974,4.5513,0.118,3.5078,3.6377,1.8678,2.7565,0.8232,4.8883,3.1301,6.0769,0.1423,3.2808,3.1731,2.5741,0.2974,1.6825,0.4804,0.0002,3.0827,4.7235,2.3699,0.4566,4.632,7.7987,2.1667,0.1039,1.4799,5.2897,3.2918,2.8025,5.0038,3.248,3.9042,0.0007,2.3628,3.3009,1.9799,1.5921,0.4026,1.5436,3.3612,1.7483,2.5565,0.5572,2.6266,1.4831,3.0742,0.7046,0.0046,0.8868,1.2378,3.776,0.0192,1.7532]}
{"id":694,"ended":true,"length":446,"gen_text":"An aging, wealthy, childless business mogul has himself cloned. The young clone is taught about life by the man, who is grooming an heir. The adolescent clone does not want to inherit.\n\nHowever, that is exactly what the young heir does. The man who is grooming his daughter. The cloning has already been done, although it has not actually been completed.\n\nIt is hard to see into other people's minds.\n\nHowever, once you have all this information and techniques of cloning before you go away, it will help you to better prepare you for the next time, but you must make your own decisions after being successful in your cloning.\n\nI hope this information and images can help you better prepare you for your future life as well as your cloning. A few things:\n\nMake your cloning more visible. As a scientist, I can see you moving away from your living space, where the cloning is taking place. There are places your parents, your siblings and your children will go and see, there are places they will have your DNA. Just making this step can help you to see if you have good enough clones or not.\n\nMake your cloning safer. It is not something new. A few years ago, you could not do your cloning safely. That is wrong. A new clone might give you some security issues: The clone will not enter into your own DNA pool or your own cloning system, where you can't make the clones yourself. With clones, it is possible to do your cloning at home and in your own private area that you are not safe from your sister clones.\n\nMaking this Clone a Reality can be done through research. It is very easy to make a clone, then clone yourself by taking a few minutes on a computer, or in this case by playing Tetris. One way to do this in the real world is by simply typing something that sounds like the words\n\nA.\n\n. A.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n. A.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nHow can I use this information to help me get better at clones and how to prevent any misunderstandings I might make?

My blog has been up for over four years now and I've been working on it for over a year. For a blog about this subject where I don't have much time for writing, this has already created some really awesome feedback. This blog will feature daily updates of my most popular articles and I will also be on top of my stories to offer our readers a deeper knowledge on what I am writing or reading about.\n\nNow to the things I can change:\n\nNo more typing like some blogs do\n\nThis blog can now change to the opposite blog\n\nMy blog can be rewritten with less people\n\nYour work here should now be easier to follow, so I'm very excited about it. I've noticed that the blogging community has also become really good to me. I feel pretty confident about the blog I started.\n\nAnd finally, if you have any questions about your blogs please contact me through the forums and I'll be happy to answer them right away.\n\nThe next five blogs:\n\nNow we will finish the blog by showing each of them individually:\n\nThe five blog blogs (above) are: Blog.com\n\nBlog.com Newbie Blogger\n\nBlog.com Newbie Blogger\n\nLosing It?\n\nThis blog is my old favorite and I hope you enjoy it.

No one's going to be able to read those stories, maybe you will. I want you to be happy. There is nobody who can read those stories, so I am going to let that one pass. I'll have something to show, right here.\n\nIf you follow my blog on Facebook and Twitter, you will have a lot of things to see. Let me know you appreciate all of them.\n\nHave fun.\n\n\u2013 Chris K\n\nWhat are your favorites and what are your thoughts on the upcoming blog blogs? What do you think about them? Let us know in the comments below.","token_len":501,"entropy":[3.8828,3.2036,5.416,3.6197,0.2,5.454,7.4592,7.887,4.8765,2.2855,9.0106,2.4755,1.007,6.062,2.2523,0.1635,0.8999,6.3855,5.7206,6.3719,4.1538,2.4639,2.2335,1.7303,4.9826,1.912,1.0402,4.8146,2.0491,2.7558,3.2489,3.5899,0.3315,5.0223,3.796,1.8551,4.8111,3.742,0.3482,5.392,4.3361,0.7714,1.5033,0.0035,3.5367,4.4005,1.1672,1.2484,4.1221,4.1336,0.4312,5.6287,0.5697,0.7899,5.4791,0.7252,1.4241,3.8131,1.2971,4.8712,0.8019,3.7295,5.2968,3.5345,3.9552,1.7978,0.1946,5.4353,2.487,1.2663,0.8071,4.6658,1.2692,1.9201,4.2151,0.4588,1.0124,1.0347,0.986,2.8914,1.5987,2.6224,0.6764,1.2763,0.5733,1.4637,1.3301,0.3027,1.0274,5.1321,2.9951,2.5434,4.1419,4.8322,3.6266,5.9142,1.2162,4.2928,0.0011,1.6305,2.5411,1.3007,2.5777,2.7583,0.7179,2.3312,2.2212,6.9009,4.8316,2.1979,2.4307,3.6135,4.9624,0.6349,4.0861,0.9856,2.7426,5.7759,5.5709,1.3014,3.1754,1.3624,4.5383,1.0799,2.8916,1.5617,3.0905,1.4123,1.6828,1.0742,4.7842,4.9286,0.0403,2.8732,4.9842,1.6602,5.3522,5.7981,0.1692,1.7082,3.2311,4.8723,2.2438,2.1767,1.2838,1.9025,2.1354,4.3106,5.7005,2.7108,1.0138,0.9599,0.0002,4.2068,3.8197,1.0335,4.5615,1.2114,4.5255,5.3825,3.212,0.1925,0.0001,5.6334,1.6662,6.0581,5.7027,4.9699,5.9601,1.8263,2.3176,0.0002,4.299,1.8414,4.2681,2.6607,5.349,2.7018,4.0336,5.3077,4.2753,1.9623,0.0002,3.8726,1.8296,2.4329,2.0614,4.5074,3.3656,2.9821,5.3163,0.9883,0.0002,5.5179,5.9504,3.8464,3.6438,3.0907,0.568,4.5916,0.5583,2.7646,2.8155,3.244,2.0204,2.5798,5.0334,1.0747,1.0648,1.0099,0.6556,1.9027,2.4816,4.872,0.6605,2.802,4.7749,0.7437,1.1061,4.6365,2.1411,4.7177,3.289,3.4923,1.1403,0.8864,1.3458,3.6851,4.8553,2.4659,1.5817,2.1457,2.7099,2.1401,4.1791,2.4376,2.2941,0.0002,3.9922,3.3844,0.4407,3.1868,0.2938,2.4114,0.5607,0.5409,1.4571,3.7101,4.4822,3.1735,3.7125,0.0828,4.1876,1.4044,4.4678,2.9559,0.9003,0.8575,1.5091,0.4183,0.0016,1.0835,0.5318,5.3803,0.4242,0.2621,0.7321,0.0002,4.1293,4.0188,6.2517,2.4859,3.0121,0.2803,0.0001,5.7243,4.246,3.0427,5.5435,2.1306,2.8421,4.0051,5.0801,5.9596,0.7872,2.1857,3.8822,3.611,0.1948,0.0001,2.5754,5.3311,2.9129,3.5096,4.5851,5.5772,0.5551,1.0912,2.0709,5.9929,4.6576,1.1266,1.3946,0.0001,1.5155,0.3056,0.6792,5.5547,4.0001,2.4237,4.407,1.5125,0.0002,1.0736,0.1355,0.0025,2.9481,0.5641,0.3967,0.0877,0.8083,0.0002,5.8343,5.15,6.0147,4.53,0.3686,0.0002,3.1743,0.8293,1.1969,3.8172,6.1708,1.7383,2.3419,0.97,2.8359,0.7312,1.6619,0.3556,1.0575,4.5773,2.4791,3.7134,1.0363,0.2005,1.0044,2.0206,6.517,5.1769,0.0369,5.7998,1.8356,2.0687,2.097,4.5571,1.903,2.4496,2.3542,5.3193,1.2276,3.9998,0.2145,0.5953,0.9964,3.0468,2.0339,2.4197,2.5951,2.5736,2.3545,0.7201,3.8742,5.8717,3.1616,6.0482,1.5293,4.5643,1.2666,0.0236,2.8658,1.3298,0.002,3.4422,6.1661,4.217,2.5306,5.7696,2.9567,1.6111,1.0424,2.2051,3.6625,2.0267,0.0787,2.2766,2.8463,1.921,5.24,1.2177,6.3081,1.8166,1.0641,0.6576,1.9639,0.1915,2.0743,2.1932,1.1827,2.662,0.8362,0.0194,4.1499,3.4257,3.8403,2.9538,0.5265,2.4044,3.6249,4.2116,4.7645,1.1092,3.1581,4.2714,4.7574,2.829,0.7454,0.6717,0.0002,3.1761,0.1452,5.3834,1.3995,0.5638,3.1292,0.9463,1.904,0.8377,0.5464,0.4347,1.205,2.9869,2.206,2.4819,0.2034,3.1347,0.709,2.3213,1.3101,5.2967,1.0088,0.2345,5.4329,5.451,3.4989,0.7671,2.3156,0.6073,1.0278,0.0002,5.274,1.3937,2.025,0.6293,0.0002,3.2325,4.7081,5.2096,3.3093,0.0003,5.2612,2.2509,0.9091,4.429,2.8422,0.945,1.795,0.9795,2.0919,0.4794,1.4303,4.5135,0.9697,2.6196,0.2051,3.2214,1.0835,0.0197,0.1381,1.5456,1.6454,0.1681,1.9499,1.2807,0.0073,0.3067,0.0138,0.0856,0.4869,0.6576]}
{"id":2459,"ended":true,"length":453,"gen_text":"Intelligent, thought provoking books are given to children, and rarely ever read by adults. Silly, Childish books are critically acclaimed and writers gain international renown. Write your submission for the Newbery Medal.\n\nA list of eligible literary awards will be posted on the Newbery website, containing titles such as The Story of the American Child, The Adventures of the American Fairy Tail, The Stories of a Childish Cartoonist, The Adventures of Children's Cartoonists, Children of Adult Cartoonists and Children's Storytellers.\n\nA selection of short story editorships is listed at the bottom of the Newbery Award page. Newbery prizes have been awarded to new entrants (for children who can read the short stories; for adults who can read stories for themselves; for youth with limited reading experience, or for teens who have reading experience); they are also awarded to outstanding authors with distinguished literary programs (for children, youth or any adult); and are presented for selection in the category of Writers of the Year.\n\nIn addition, writers of children's stories are also encouraged to submit a short story about some of the key elements of popular culture. A short story collection includes any number of themes of the characters, from pop culture references to real life themes and trends relating to science, science fiction and fantasy (often written by adult writers), to themes of religion and politics. The short story is often based on the original short story, and the short story is often based on the author's own works. This is done by adding several short stories to a collection of two or fewer short stories that are in line with the Newbery Awards.\n\nThe Newbery Award will be presented next Tuesday, January 9, 2013 at 7:00 p.m. in the National Library of Medicine on the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.\n\nL.W. McDaniel is a Fellow of Newbery Prize Winners, a Newbery Magazine Award Candidate, an Awardee for a Distinguished Service Award, an E-book Contest, a Young Adult Novel Award, an Editor's Choice Award, and an Editorial Journal Editorial Award.

His short stories, works of fiction, memoirs and non-fiction have made numerous TV series, toured continents, and appeared in print and radio programs on television stations, radio and Internet. He is currently Editor-in-Chief of the Newbery Journal and the Editor-in-Chief of Social Media.","token_len":502,"entropy":[10.7962,3.6238,7.6799,3.2704,6.2067,2.8573,6.7354,2.3046,2.4098,2.6226,2.1923,7.5927,5.2045,2.5279,1.6485,0.5643,0.3514,8.3348,3.8265,2.0162,9.7317,0.2832,6.8504,0.913,10.2923,0.4516,1.6098,8.5855,8.1187,4.7373,2.9844,1.1746,8.8573,2.3618,11.2659,3.4659,2.3189,5.3514,3.8537,5.1486,1.7991,0.8941,0.001,4.027,4.4158,0.0436,3.2288,4.1388,2.8515,2.9333,0.1033,1.4078,0.8663,0.7253,1.0891,0.0015,1.2169,2.531,6.56,5.0357,1.8497,0.0026,2.6703,5.7595,0.2829,2.1447,4.7267,5.2272,0.6985,1.1353,4.0542,0.0394,2.4949,3.4907,5.5007,2.5815,0.3312,1.0725,4.9575,0.1377,4.0122,3.0932,3.4698,4.1935,0.225,0.2663,1.1479,1.2065,0.0067,4.6721,0.8635,3.6151,0.7495,0.3367,3.1918,3.1206,4.8347,0.9086,0.1121,1.7503,1.842,0.7737,4.8288,0.2191,0.1254,0.2659,1.045,0.0003,3.2027,3.0024,0.0547,3.302,3.0708,6.1596,5.6529,2.1098,4.8574,2.5561,0.5602,1.0915,0.0929,0.4419,2.3673,0.0004,3.6868,1.4289,0.3903,5.697,0.0037,4.1829,4.479,0.565,1.0822,0.9179,4.7762,4.6938,4.706,4.157,3.3664,4.4809,4.1091,2.1437,2.752,1.996,0.8935,5.5825,1.5734,1.7194,1.088,0.8785,0.4609,4.0814,2.6252,3.3812,2.1953,0.845,6.2854,4.2629,3.0846,2.4629,1.4821,2.5616,2.1894,0.6384,5.7303,1.0145,1.7363,5.7773,1.1456,2.7825,4.4204,0.8046,2.5956,1.5282,0.5518,4.9884,1.8552,3.5856,5.6414,3.3691,5.9976,2.7467,1.3747,1.7405,1.6948,4.0366,3.4592,5.3146,4.5393,1.7781,0.5345,3.8881,3.1702,2.9402,4.3161,1.5956,0.893,5.5653,0.6155,5.5769,0.6625,0.5547,0.1038,0.5203,0.6073,0.0002,3.9781,0.7955,0.6908,4.562,1.6998,2.7548,0.059,1.4651,1.2959,2.4868,3.8717,0.0309,0.8361,2.6304,0.836,0.1135,4.4798,5.7323,1.0815,1.0529,5.7987,4.0229,0.2683,6.3302,1.8166,1.4853,3.4306,1.8989,0.1041,3.7391,4.0994,5.0367,3.7787,0.006,5.4798,3.6358,2.0094,4.6647,0.9047,3.6658,4.2909,0.1879,2.4317,0.3394,5.1713,0.5485,4.7393,2.5745,5.065,7.2759,0.0283,4.1105,0.9979,4.9547,0.1754,0.8908,0.3812,4.0957,5.082,4.4706,0.6096,4.2469,1.1125,1.6149,1.0671,5.455,1.0939,4.504,1.1836,2.4515,0.9459,2.5976,1.4553,0.5095,2.3588,3.6884,4.3998,0.1205,2.0144,3.9635,3.4554,0.0992,1.2325,1.3304,1.9055,3.2064,0.1742,1.1482,2.1547,2.7012,0.1019,1.5172,3.5985,0.1382,1.1019,4.9118,0.545,4.446,1.5761,3.5024,2.3775,3.5034,6.1064,3.1608,0.3596,0.7855,1.8214,1.0172,2.367,6.1417,0.5801,5.0424,1.3347,0.0332,3.8081,1.2756,3.5801,4.6299,0.2109,0.4745,4.8937,0.0012,3.2322,1.3269,0.7123,0.0002,2.085,0.8172,0.0005,1.1032,3.6313,0.4008,1.3848,5.8491,3.3763,0.1885,3.0259,3.3236,0.5571,2.9021,1.4795,2.462,0.3465,0.3755,0.9115,0.0006,0.0008,0.184,1.9326,0.5631,4.341,2.4126,0.1586,0.375,4.5886,1.0298,5.9735,1.6959,2.0625,0.085,0.0105,0.0305,1.1953,1.3598,0.0003,5.6274,3.4668,4.8158,0.0392,5.1061,3.6594,1.434,1.0165,5.1935,0.7235,2.5928,0.0409,4.9535,2.7717,2.0182,2.4839,2.9327,0.0353,5.8224,1.9257,6.1098,0.8044,2.8106,3.5821,3.943,2.5385,3.2698,4.2099,0.0098,2.4347,1.5569,0.7357,1.9407,4.9932,2.3162,3.0223,4.7126,1.3914,1.141,3.9793,1.2393,2.6088,1.0433,0.5147,1.6582,5.5375,0.3666,0.5028,0.221,0.543,1.3387,1.8735,4.0112,4.9291,5.5179,0.9713,0.1934,1.2639,0.8252,3.1319,2.421,0.8804,2.6871,5.016,0.5769,5.6172,1.7648,3.0636,2.8151,3.6254,0.9114,2.2938,6.1824,1.2067,0.6692,0.4622,4.1975,0.3858,0.9656,2.5398,1.7916,0.0047,1.2169,6.3941,4.7137,4.0763,3.1328,0.4879,5.6503,4.701,0.6286,1.1613,2.6703,0.2729,3.078,0.8161,3.5238,2.7557,4.5058,2.1541,2.7098,2.417,0.9063,2.1374,4.1506,1.2863,1.3592,1.0992,2.8087,6.3453,0.5979,0.0405,0.0021,0.0098,0.2328,1.3045,0.922,0.0592,2.5158,1.6324,2.4254,2.6165,0.3439,0.0344,0.0011,0.0153,0.0495,5.609,0.1763,1.1152]}
{"id":3357,"ended":true,"length":501,"gen_text":"Your looks, smarts, and charm have made you extremely successful. You fall in love, but she says you're too perfect. You try to fail at something to get her, but luck has other plans. You never go to sleep in the way you'd like. You need to do something for her so she can make up for it. You need to make love for her to be happy. All she needs is love but she doesn't want it right now. How do you feel before she leaves and when she comes to see you?, and most importantly, she's waiting for her own answer. She has no time for your body or you have no energy to grow inside her. The more you're done, the less you need her help for any way she wants. If she starts eating the same things that you need, your love will burn brighter and she'll know your needs. She will love giving you her love, when she's free. She can give you any feeling she wants and she won't give up. Love, love, Love. Your soul and your body. Just like you made some of the other girls eat those foods. It turns yourself into a great person. She makes you feel good. If you try to quit, she won't have a reason to give up. If you try to stay put in the relationship, her moods will get better which will set you right. You start feeling loved but you do not stay put. You will fall in love once and for all, but every time she's willing to make you happy, you do it. The more you love, the more you begin to look at each other like you will only become a little more like you. If you don't get yourself accepted by her, the more she loses control you're losing control over yourself. I won't lie, my body is changing so fast in the last year or so I don't feel my feelings begin to go away. All that you need is you make love so she can make you happy. I want you to love me instead of feeling afraid and afraid with no one saying it will ever happen to you. She could be happy living her life in isolation, or she can spend her time with you. Either way, if you feel her hold back any form of love for you again, even as you're not happy with her at this time, just try again. That is all your heart should be for right now. Thank you, Mrs..","token_len":502,"entropy":[8.4747,1.9473,8.2558,2.1036,0.3956,0.955,5.1419,3.1789,3.1838,2.6219,6.9549,3.1862,1.3861,2.5352,8.1262,0.5094,0.0398,2.6473,3.6045,6.7291,4.6555,1.3701,1.142,2.7262,6.3086,1.236,1.7904,4.3594,0.4086,8.0429,2.9468,3.0908,5.1393,2.064,1.8315,3.794,0.3603,10.0014,3.7977,6.0581,0.9198,0.4093,1.8145,5.2599,4.4631,1.7362,3.8291,4.2789,1.3489,6.699,0.8916,3.0048,0.4054,1.1962,1.2785,5.0358,0.7541,3.6076,1.162,3.4201,0.252,4.7018,0.7728,1.051,3.8838,3.1946,0.1034,1.2541,0.3573,1.8916,3.0983,0.2887,2.8299,3.841,3.5826,0.1943,3.9282,2.5627,2.4023,0.9466,5.8637,2.8613,1.0122,0.5496,2.1376,6.6272,1.4303,1.3939,0.0003,2.107,1.117,4.0982,0.0187,0.1625,5.6345,1.5304,0.087,3.0842,6.6246,1.6209,3.1261,3.919,3.4133,0.7179,1.6161,3.4357,3.0817,0.1202,11.5739,3.4363,6.8654,0.2636,0.705,4.4692,2.5299,4.1259,0.3631,2.7374,3.7705,4.2953,0.7137,2.6887,3.6285,1.8137,3.3867,0.7557,3.4691,5.3192,2.8574,3.1365,4.4391,0.6,5.4311,1.1307,5.1527,5.3515,0.6501,0.4149,4.1926,3.6137,0.5352,4.0662,5.5898,1.5276,0.0994,1.8235,1.2221,1.7826,2.1278,4.4776,5.248,4.1804,5.1558,1.5192,3.0588,1.2791,3.7367,1.0999,5.638,5.2993,3.8868,1.9026,3.0628,2.5085,0.5916,4.6796,0.9044,4.1699,5.3572,0.75,4.5097,5.4492,1.2346,2.3718,0.6772,4.048,4.508,2.517,1.5486,2.0212,1.8183,2.4973,7.5868,0.4253,3.396,2.159,1.7755,6.07,0.876,1.8239,5.2293,1.1809,1.9604,3.6752,3.3287,0.148,3.6307,5.2175,1.1595,0.3263,2.4161,1.2747,2.6468,0.0006,2.9733,2.6968,1.1568,4.8536,3.4514,1.8037,0.4599,5.7246,1.1807,4.546,5.7933,3.8989,1.0106,0.7716,2.7559,5.8588,1.5234,2.3217,6.1119,6.3197,2.4968,1.274,3.5355,1.6086,5.3171,4.8253,3.6556,1.8859,3.2996,5.885,7.7873,0.6649,0.923,5.0173,2.1117,1.0523,2.3713,4.0965,0.4381,1.0788,1.553,1.564,4.277,0.791,4.4403,0.2949,5.1658,1.4899,0.4937,2.6545,0.0006,4.7452,2.5323,3.1612,0.347,4.2906,0.8467,0.5404,2.4499,0.4711,1.6175,0.1266,2.7429,4.9104,4.7815,1.359,2.8042,0.4063,3.5396,5.2955,2.2093,0.4978,2.286,2.2611,7.0332,0.9317,5.4216,0.5326,4.5313,1.1831,1.9529,4.9327,3.0991,4.696,3.9804,1.8478,5.6991,1.5677,4.7947,2.1714,0.6312,1.3261,3.1263,3.9959,0.5352,0.0028,4.9766,2.5451,1.4499,0.0006,2.2121,0.849,6.0098,0.5648,2.0042,3.0884,5.103,0.0683,3.651,0.9021,2.681,1.1473,1.1405,4.3739,1.6412,0.9111,3.6491,1.3032,0.3681,1.8469,2.364,0.0223,0.5373,0.7359,5.7472,0.1209,4.8965,1.5564,2.8617,0.0641,2.733,0.7947,6.4544,5.8221,3.2699,1.7767,2.6925,1.8602,2.9308,1.386,0.4648,3.4449,0.505,2.6539,0.0004,3.5002,5.4454,5.0425,2.2613,0.3211,0.4364,4.0108,1.2383,1.1848,5.658,2.1575,6.2199,3.8987,4.1646,1.9163,0.8489,1.4031,0.2531,4.8396,5.2922,0.0027,1.3842,0.7306,4.3057,2.4986,1.3507,4.2555,3.4078,0.8553,4.4793,1.3542,0.8383,2.0142,2.352,0.3111,3.0798,2.2687,0.0002,2.4993,4.618,4.8161,5.4256,0.0459,4.2642,0.2927,0.22,4.8999,3.3862,3.4666,2.3981,0.9217,4.3306,4.8336,0.5871,4.9942,0.7256,0.5216,1.6672,1.436,0.2666,0.3765,2.628,3.0854,1.0628,0.1235,2.3405,1.4402,6.6478,0.1257,4.242,5.4481,2.3134,2.5318,5.6968,4.0694,2.6023,6.1138,3.4979,3.6692,3.8122,0.4359,2.0942,0.0771,0.2493,3.6626,5.4542,2.4533,3.2546,6.2711,2.4261,0.2172,3.2378,4.769,1.1396,2.8802,0.4863,3.897,6.3734,0.9505,1.0483,0.9245,1.1433,1.6438,4.4192,0.0197,0.2913,3.1653,1.0676,3.8233,3.6162,5.7534,4.5026,6.2575,5.3019,0.0061,0.7644,2.7473,0.6301,6.75,0.269,6.8081,5.72,1.9409,2.4883,4.0771,2.4599,1.3524,1.005,3.7514,3.518,2.575,0.1752,3.6379,3.5617,3.5995,0.4733,4.4978,2.9634,2.8655,4.8736,4.4176,3.9076,0.6713,1.4885,3.666,0.0095,0.2788,5.3796,0.0919,2.5668,5.3799,7.8833]}

However, it was only a handful of nations who agreed to fight against it. On the other hand, America was also the largest and most populous nation on Earth. It was also home to our most successful battles.\n\nIt's easy to understand why we feel such loyalty to the United States. We recognize the American people's willingness to work with us, and are willing to give our time together.\n\nOf course, what we're not prepared to do is put our lives on the line for a second time. But that goes for all of us regardless of what our national priorities are.\n\nThis is why there's so many Americans who are ready to volunteer their time, fight for their country, and serve in our military. The truth is, Americans often die in war. The lives they save can save lives.\n\nThe War is Over\n\nPresident Trump is ready to take care of our country. That means taking action on President Trump's order to impose martial law.\n\nIn fact as of this week, three senators from California \u2014 Lindsey Graham, Mike Lee, and Jeff Flake \u2014 have joined the president in opposing further action. They have indicated their willingness to stand up to what our president has called \"an enemy we do not know and that is Russia.\"\n\nWe are all in support of martial law that will eliminate the threat of any foreign terrorist groups from America. The American People will stand with the Americans in fighting for what is right.\n\nWhile this is something many Americans agree on, it may not be an option for the people of the United States. We want to see how our elected leaders can stand up to what the Trump administration is doing.\n\nIt will take action. It's about time. We're not prepared to allow Trump to put his foot down and continue blocking our fight. If you believe in keeping the American people safe, you should join me in fighting for us now.\n\nJoin over 24,000 Americans who live in and around this place. Together, we can stop this man for who he is.","token_len":503,"entropy":[11.2206,2.617,11.236,1.5374,1.687,4.5078,2.1781,0.0277,3.3451,1.7092,5.0571,0.4061,3.0839,0.114,0.3773,4.5967,1.476,1.8929,2.7331,0.1479,3.3913,0.1979,0.5534,0.8491,4.82,0.2462,1.6266,2.8426,0.0976,2.7662,3.6526,0.2498,1.5141,3.4878,9.1279,0.4671,0.7978,0.9149,2.9365,0.0002,3.4285,1.22,2.9634,0.0557,2.4808,2.3218,3.1042,0.8383,1.6925,0.4731,4.9501,1.0029,4.3761,3.0798,1.8291,2.3937,0.0002,2.116,2.7667,3.3245,0.1193,1.3702,6.172,1.4398,3.7546,3.1541,1.59,3.9543,0.2279,1.4051,0.5287,2.2121,0.416,0.8705,2.3398,2.8035,4.8157,0.5459,4.3488,1.5892,2.0541,4.2182,0.9312,4.2845,0.0188,3.2194,0.5393,3.1179,2.4865,5.4135,0.0284,1.2386,1.8628,2.2567,0.2461,4.7327,3.2642,4.5982,0.3387,5.9823,2.0903,1.4876,0.3289,0.0073,4.8441,1.8088,3.3289,3.3208,3.0798,2.6413,0.5958,2.5069,0.7297,1.8208,1.0842,0.5694,3.209,0.9928,1.9723,3.0997,0.0155,6.7678,2.4198,3.79,4.7295,1.1508,0.3346,0.0002,3.8475,2.5002,3.269,0.0419,2.7114,0.2187,3.7443,3.8207,3.9016,4.3236,0.3691,0.8689,0.2421,0.0062,0.6252,2.1633,5.5868,1.8108,3.7416,2.0668,1.2203,4.8271,0.0652,3.4599,2.0256,0.8601,1.7991,1.0306,4.1956,2.3484,0.026,3.6941,1.4321,1.5861,7.3648,1.1817,1.2978,0.0001,5.3261,0.0682,0.0616,4.898,1.6749,2.6646,2.2218,2.693,0.6978,0.6384,0.3594,4.3455,1.1501,1.1059,0.3932,0.0677,0.0005,0.9414,2.4739,3.9222,2.9749,0.4718,3.5009,2.586,6.8874,1.3471,2.435,0.9281,0.0837,5.013,0.0921,2.4048,2.1126,4.2806,4.0252,0.2561,0.2827,0.5681,0.0001,4.213,1.0762,1.0166,4.8206,1.5433,1.8431,3.5875,2.8703,0.8101,1.8221,3.0129,0.1569,5.3493,1.4384,0.4093,2.6728,5.5111,1.2498,3.2428,0.2215,0.4187,0.4013,3.8235,2.0625,1.6448,1.109,0.2339,4.3134,4.899,0.0878,0.5724,4.3237,5.5317,5.4531,2.272,2.7813,0.8872,3.5972,5.5964,1.9112,1.6821,2.7266,2.533,1.5279,1.1328,0.5907,0.0001,2.9736,3.9669,4.1684,1.2684,0.5412,0.0001,5.6554,2.2561,2.0938,4.4534,0.2329,2.2633,5.1753,0.0178,1.5379,2.0821,1.0121,4.4371,1.3718,2.7208,2.1368,2.7307,6.1252,0.2095,0.0982,4.4695,0.9586,5.5256,1.1925,0.0076,2.1535,0.6864,0.0001,3.0866,2.4112,9.6306,1.65,2.3781,3.9399,0.1208,6.1964,5.3693,1.7041,2.8371,3.7474,5.059,0.0041,0.3764,3.0924,0.0358,1.0361,0.0176,2.1481,0.0315,0.0324,0.5073,2.5778,1.3467,2.3033,0.6682,4.1962,6.8203,1.8968,1.025,3.3862,2.8133,4.969,2.3275,3.0346,0.0182,2.6497,0.8108,1.0178,4.6262,4.696,1.9296,1.4854,1.704,1.0969,2.9074,3.3358,3.2505,3.1306,0.0039,3.548,2.0597,2.994,2.258,3.2523,0.3395,0.1483,0.0001,2.954,2.4163,3.0654,2.8547,4.0848,0.0431,5.0712,0.0121,4.5347,1.2098,6.1971,0.9933,1.4378,0.4795,3.7457,2.787,3.2807,3.2829,2.3514,2.9261,0.5154,3.2241,3.1544,6.5216,2.2477,2.7798,1.0773,2.4279,2.902,2.0166,2.6476,1.1261,4.421,1.2725,0.0657,0.7708,0.4666,0.0001,4.5855,3.1693,1.2546,3.6448,4.1825,0.7399,4.6726,2.0389,0.1183,1.2564,4.901,1.0059,0.5178,4.2867,2.8674,0.9484,2.446,3.4329,0.2368,0.8685,0.1758,0.003,0.542,2.6594,4.3905,0.7143,1.8893,5.8333,2.2245,4.8577,1.2741,2.3996,2.4387,0.2101,0.6548,2.4377,2.6206,4.3403,0.1893,0.8102,0.6288,0.5554,0.4711,0.0001,3.6151,3.3814,1.3442,2.5338,2.8109,1.6186,1.7513,4.0711,0.556,0.3271,2.6914,2.1639,2.2103,3.7462,0.6182,4.5191,3.4927,0.2648,3.7139,2.2777,3.1596,0.4387,1.3802,4.5967,6.2124,1.7468,4.6004,0.7402,4.7957,2.683,2.3278,1.5376,6.2515,1.8817,1.4364,0.0781,0.0573,0.3372,1.7663,1.9034,1.4599,3.2111,0.3306,2.6071,0.4129,4.9247,5.646,0.1634,0.4239,0.0001,4.736,6.6316,5.6568,0.096,0.0849,3.0897,0.771,5.9012,1.1607,3.0358,0.1644,3.7828,5.9398,0.9175,5.1013,0.4954,0.2229,0.9923,2.4125,1.4817,4.955,6.115,2.2334,0.0966,0.1396,0.5755]}

You should really love them when they grow up.\"\n\n\"What really goes on is that the state must give up its powers, and there is no longer anything we can do to stop it, so some of the other powers are going to make it worse,\" said Mowat. \"There needs to be a new constitution. I hope this will help. But we must do everything we can to defend ourselves. And even if they want to give up power, this isn't something that can be done. All rights are yours. But we can't afford to give up the rights of others.\"\n\nWith respect to his views of democracy, Mowat admitted that he could never support a republic without the support of a minority. What he would like for a candidate to stand for is equality under the law; that if necessary, he would support a general election, if necessary, he would support a second parliamentary election, if necessary, and then a third. But in the long run, he said that what could be most useful, in any case, for a candidate to seek is that those with the most power will nominate a candidate. The only thing that matters for a candidate is that he makes it possible for people to vote for that person. Whether or not the voters want to, it is irrelevant.\n\n\"When we lose the electoral college, they turn away and they make sure I am not allowed to run as part of the party. We're not happy with that,\" he said. \"We can't afford for another one to be built up on the basis of fear and resentment... I want to see more democracy in this country, where people feel that democracy, even if it is an imperfect form, is better.\"","token_len":503,"entropy":[8.8063,4.4045,0.963,10.5162,1.8043,2.2014,3.8118,18.6727,7.6329,8.8566,9.3739,5.2921,5.6675,1.6089,5.9743,1.8292,2.0572,5.0877,4.3918,3.7587,3.2783,3.6679,0.1385,2.7247,3.4314,1.4301,2.2449,3.6923,5.7007,2.4852,0.7101,3.031,0.5249,1.3622,2.2265,5.1207,6.5485,3.6159,0.0947,4.1033,1.8144,1.4079,5.5734,0.2035,0.0434,5.4355,3.9944,3.0907,2.3827,5.2245,1.5756,4.5687,5.017,0.0415,3.1516,2.4646,0.7414,2.6732,0.0348,0.003,4.6289,2.3124,4.1043,2.6996,2.2359,5.5654,1.8069,6.383,1.7134,6.4596,6.2469,1.6023,5.7464,1.3449,4.2999,5.2081,2.9633,6.7434,3.1851,0.1312,0.0072,5.3799,3.9011,1.3873,0.0397,0.0022,3.0354,2.8644,1.4015,2.1693,2.2644,0.8355,2.0096,2.3017,2.6372,0.0181,4.5727,1.9589,3.5525,5.2862,2.1214,0.7941,4.0156,0.5675,2.9045,5.6043,0.602,2.9407,0.4404,0.0016,2.4076,2.1944,2.2375,0.0135,1.1548,1.1398,5.432,1.0963,0.2127,2.9385,1.1349,2.2117,4.7181,2.7945,2.8906,3.8551,4.6325,6.1361,1.2111,0.8648,0.3088,0.3165,1.6843,2.9854,1.6869,2.7328,4.773,0.5266,0.2264,3.9377,1.567,0.7246,2.4916,1.3183,5.8355,0.6036,5.1948,2.4411,1.4974,1.0504,0.83,2.8048,3.0079,5.2112,5.7283,0.5295,4.685,0.4274,1.5405,0.0238,1.4735,0.2144,0.0002,2.9761,3.6113,6.2011,5.3196,0.289,3.3212,1.6229,2.5713,5.6946,5.0459,4.3266,2.9356,1.6724,4.9501,2.5245,1.4287,4.7092,1.0703,0.5005,4.123,3.2955,2.6866,0.2619,0.0564,1.7243,1.2878,0.6364,3.2821,2.732,6.2566,1.4893,1.4217,3.976,2.8377,1.6337,1.9193,0.047,5.185,1.5342,1.3291,0.8212,2.8329,5.4386,4.587,1.5488,0.6359,0.5758,3.3289,4.6359,0.0034,0.0062,1.0531,3.4844,2.5278,1.5179,2.841,3.3875,3.0981,1.5639,2.3076,2.3884,1.9251,2.2181,2.8991,3.0929,2.0082,0.5283,0.0232,0.2129,5.1426,1.6288,1.4873,2.9549,5.3346,0.326,2.7691,3.7224,0.4195,4.2625,0.4841,2.1254,0.3302,4.2286,3.1827,0.0016,3.3992,0.9791,1.8275,0.3854,1.7024,1.5218,5.1166,5.25,1.2216,4.1274,1.3077,3.3347,1.9123,2.5076,0.3042,5.6934,0.1972,1.9981,0.335,2.8404,2.3682,0.9186,0.7733,1.3476,0.2302,0.0002,5.3729,4.5262,0.0498,2.7287,4.6496,3.5608,4.4131,0.4838,1.5384,0.0016,0.0023,4.8222,0.5272,1.2248,4.0598,3.6711,3.1729,1.7724,4.706,2.0331,2.0941,2.6275,0.0266,2.8622,3.4121,0.9578,6.4044,0.8003,3.1835,1.8154,3.1265,2.1317,6.6722,1.1538,4.5087,0.5504,0.9088,5.689,5.9968,0.3806,0.0384,3.6818,2.5139,6.2285,6.581,0.4055,0.7033,0.7069,2.8833,1.972,5.5153,0.3892,2.164,3.5789,0.9067,0.5313,1.0206,0.0893,1.0261,0.7269,4.0532,4.8283,0.7376,1.1149,0.3655,0.0397,0.11,1.6062,3.0629,2.9642,1.0869,1.629,2.2572,3.6329,1.8599,4.025,0.1118,0.2704,0.6381,1.3058,3.3499,5.0283,4.4916,0.6225,4.611,3.5759,3.3713,3.0779,3.4951,1.4007,0.0674,2.6892,1.6576,1.5855,1.5885,4.7654,2.1156,3.0241,5.8877,3.66,1.6458,1.1657,1.6593,3.8309,5.1735,1.5537,0.7144,3.5447,3.7901,3.092,2.5151,0.8515,3.3628,2.5219,1.5242,0.7537,0.8427,0.9535,0.6925,5.142,1.9096,3.018,0.3088,2.5064,0.5151,1.8785,1.0317,3.4305,2.0412,0.6424,6.6557,1.797,0.0011,2.6223,4.8219,2.6705,1.0783,5.3638,2.337,1.2426,4.5597,0.5767,1.0135,0.0002,1.1618,4.1219,2.2924,4.8117,2.2422,4.682,0.7622,0.3889,4.2154,6.1125,4.1287,3.5193,3.2173,5.3005,3.6775,5.9574,2.4019,1.4062,3.5346,0.2121,1.6386,3.9426,5.0978,0.0042,1.5521,2.3675,1.7767,3.2724,3.8776,1.2843,5.032,1.3362,0.6343,1.4204,0.4415,0.6347,0.211,0.2094,1.7456,3.2999,0.3078,2.9125,4.8628,5.1842,3.5564,0.7623,2.0018,5.1029,2.8799,3.9827,1.3252,1.8214,0.211,4.3278,1.4043,3.6942,7.574,2.8141,2.923,0.8346,2.004,3.2745,2.3623,1.9834,1.9282,0.0366,1.7519,3.8623,1.4081,2.8812,2.3389,4.4038,4.6888,3.1669,0.691,0.7065,1.2537,4.2355,2.9314,1.9087,0.7849,0.5581,3.2681,3.1052]}
{"id":4188,"ended":true,"length":463,"gen_text":"Superheroes are real, but are sponsored by companies to pay for their super powers. At first everyone loved the drop in crime, but the non-stop advertising eventually drives everyone to the brink of madness. It is up to one organization of antiheroes to stop them.The world needs ADBLOCATED villains to stop these people from coming to earth and stop these villains from spreading their evil around.The best known villain for the last decade was KENNETH LEE. I'm not a fan of the idea that LEE has been forced out of his job or that he is just a giant psychopath like many celebrities do in movies and on TV. I still hope that LEE can give his antihero powers to new people or that he will show up with the perfect name and character.I'm very interested in KENNETH LEE's stories as well, with his amazing character development, which is very much a love letter to LEE himself, and the fact that I like his style and the way he tells his stories without trying to steal ideas from them. I don't mind that he can be a very, very real man in a very big world, but I'm very curious about his role as Superman.I think he might be the most interesting villain of them all. He will become so dangerous that he will be like one of the most deadly assassins in comic book history. He might destroy a planet completely, leaving one whole planet to rot like a ghost for two thousand years. I've had some really great ideas for his villainy so far. If he is a lot stronger, it is my hope that the same is true for KENNETH LEE.In any case, I don't think we are done yet with him.The last book he wrote about Superman has been published in Japan - he wrote it as a hardcover. He will continue to do interesting comic book writing and character development on his own volo, so all in all I hope that he makes a great ending to this book, where we find out that LEE had gotten so powerful so many years previously (during his life), she started out just as a super villain, and he has been going about his business for so long that we could be sure he would continue to get help from others. We are at a point now where the only way to stop the evil is by having some kind of peace. Let the world do its part and have the peace it needs to.","token_len":503,"entropy":[9.396,0.7176,3.7364,6.6674,1.6127,2.2438,3.9716,10.3923,0.1654,4.3656,5.3254,4.8093,0.999,1.2892,6.063,3.1478,0.6334,6.1354,3.296,6.8447,6.7954,1.6156,11.3618,2.8916,6.0694,1.5204,0.2884,2.7024,8.4365,0.0859,3.5461,7.6844,5.4459,7.9871,4.8885,2.0449,2.5123,2.9349,0.36,2.2275,0.4678,3.4344,2.6148,3.9827,0.0289,4.9805,6.6207,4.2206,7.4313,1.6711,0.0111,0.3,2.27,3.6798,1.6613,6.3905,4.667,3.8265,10.7258,8.121,4.4557,2.744,5.2636,1.5953,1.6912,2.6903,4.9051,1.2445,3.9836,0.8779,3.7989,2.5021,3.1228,3.1955,2.7583,0.2884,3.5962,1.6765,1.5787,4.758,1.2892,4.3179,4.4707,4.7473,2.4617,4.3023,1.3177,4.3888,2.9602,2.0949,5.5854,4.4336,1.5864,0.0025,4.0685,1.4753,1.0715,5.709,3.157,1.1454,3.5923,1.1626,0.1418,1.7166,3.1414,1.9504,4.0261,0.0534,3.2893,2.7081,5.6338,2.8626,0.3623,1.7097,2.7216,3.6959,1.9379,0.6189,1.8178,3.8947,1.3787,5.6557,5.404,4.1285,3.3171,6.6426,2.963,4.5733,3.1423,2.1528,3.9893,0.8386,0.2802,1.8399,4.8113,6.1602,1.0548,2.2994,0.0068,2.2653,5.5781,2.5087,5.2433,0.1928,4.9196,1.4356,6.2381,2.3419,4.552,1.9315,0.8537,1.9062,4.4662,2.4695,3.5508,2.5341,4.7984,5.7058,1.4834,4.2959,1.3284,3.006,2.3539,4.0347,2.8249,0.3343,5.8699,0.0852,0.0008,0.0053,0.2806,0.0006,1.0679,5.0859,2.8656,1.1701,2.4056,5.5881,1.262,4.7924,3.0295,0.9651,1.1407,5.7686,1.4264,3.4569,2.5032,1.9088,5.6732,0.3006,0.0666,5.3461,0.0274,3.4497,2.8133,1.3309,1.814,2.4391,0.0312,3.9344,3.6525,1.335,4.4443,1.6426,2.6838,1.5848,0.3066,5.1054,1.0039,0.7978,5.4011,4.3303,0.1449,5.2886,4.6561,0.4946,4.2332,0.2333,1.8465,4.0453,0.001,3.9937,1.814,0.987,3.9028,1.9893,1.3613,4.126,5.3682,0.019,5.3296,3.9838,3.1379,1.9502,1.7776,4.4471,2.2867,0.9593,0.5715,0.882,2.409,2.8715,2.6888,1.7261,1.3312,4.5064,1.858,4.9416,1.3098,2.31,2.7967,2.7708,4.1364,0.7318,1.539,1.9992,1.7713,2.6649,1.9799,3.5181,0.005,0.7612,1.7452,4.3511,4.8343,4.4757,5.5523,0.9583,1.3534,0.9372,2.5065,5.0321,4.8688,0.1799,0.644,1.5029,4.311,4.5106,0.9167,4.9437,0.7568,0.1177,0.4442,1.7367,3.2488,6.4796,2.7796,2.9281,4.1894,1.1163,5.5424,4.5376,5.6511,2.2258,1.8401,2.516,3.9671,0.8334,4.4987,4.3407,4.9433,2.2341,0.0487,0.7367,2.2363,4.2025,4.2662,2.3062,2.5159,1.9798,2.1254,0.5684,2.1084,3.0638,1.5983,3.9241,0.0192,2.0234,4.4398,1.3336,2.29,2.5789,4.5492,3.7205,2.1536,3.3529,3.0034,5.4301,0.485,0.1008,3.3084,5.1224,3.4386,0.2034,0.7019,2.5565,0.0228,0.0002,0.0022,0.0384,0.0007,0.3126,4.965,2.3891,0.3975,0.1289,0.9166,3.9693,0.0007,0.8821,3.4368,2.9345,2.3635,1.6291,1.1737,3.9274,0.6125,5.9497,3.8362,4.1515,3.5306,1.7048,3.428,2.328,4.0186,0.8123,2.974,1.5237,5.0144,6.6269,3.433,3.461,2.0141,3.0649,0.7242,5.0847,0.1388,1.6325,2.3963,3.7248,3.4774,0.3166,2.7808,6.0402,4.6008,0.8592,3.8666,1.6892,5.4735,0.5353,3.3437,1.706,0.4391,6.3714,7.012,1.9605,2.2099,5.7814,5.4236,0.0167,1.3587,2.6346,0.7247,1.2234,3.7293,1.5733,1.3387,4.8981,1.105,1.2903,2.3769,3.011,6.0793,2.1411,3.6529,0.8758,2.3508,3.5761,0.0152,3.9588,5.5022,3.2734,2.4373,4.6802,2.7919,0.8258,5.1358,5.4563,6.0352,1.4361,3.0916,2.8267,7.0578,5.4318,4.638,4.4955,0.8449,0.8507,2.3196,1.9929,1.5451,1.3655,3.2276,2.1631,2.1031,4.2583,4.007,0.7304,1.1438,2.4516,1.824,0.198,1.0134,4.268,4.4718,3.544,1.6712,1.7731,1.4925,3.7637,0.693,3.6129,5.9959,0.7841,3.8484,0.8695,4.4428,2.5779,4.4218,1.2349,0.6071,1.4849,0.1196,2.7153,2.3842,0.9483,0.7538,1.2125,2.2493,1.4152,1.6967,3.0856,4.2795,3.8457,1.6675,0.0031,4.0075,2.3331,5.9444,2.4085,2.1643,3.9068,0.8511,1.2558,1.6576,4.5862,2.8413,2.2733,3.3128,1.1666,1.3947,1.4072]}

The Rock really appreciates a lot of music but is always looking for new music that is original.\n\n. During his live shows The Rock just sings and dances, and plays and plays and plays.\n\n. If you find The Rock in the middle of your day, please let him know so that he may discover it and help you.\n\n. The Pop is looking for music to hit our small festival. A few of us have been going to a local pop concert with a group of old friends while they were away in Hawaii. One of them invited us home. The Rock wanted to make the trip, and got some directions from the Rock on his way there. We got here about 90 minutes after we headed up so some of the crowd caught up with us. It turns out The Rock was driving right and when he was waiting for us on his way there, he asked if it was his place that was having an event. The Rock didn't mind, because he wasn't driving straight, which is so important in the Rock way of doing things.\n\n. At our show The Rock was doing his 'piano guitar' impression, and got the crowd into a rocking frenzy. When he came out the audience loved him ; others don't.\n\nAfter this one episode The Rock just sings and dances. It has very high opinion if it's old music.\n\n. The Pop is on our show looking for new music that should suit our event, even when we're not at the festival.\n\n. I didn't think The Rock was gonna enjoy anything.\n\n. I just felt that the Rock was the most fun to hear.\n\n. He was really enjoying his day and he even seemed to like me.\n\n. The song \" The Rock Rock\" was used at some concerts in Australia.\n\n. The Pop likes the 'tickle and turn away' song that The Rock sings.\n\n. There you have it. We tried The Rock, The Pop, and The Pop, and we have now reached another goal. Let's go on the road.","token_len":504,"entropy":[2.5562,2.9839,2.9868,0.5171,7.1652,0.8478,2.6594,3.474,6.5029,5.1917,5.5272,1.1231,4.8216,1.3634,1.1575,5.4467,3.8599,3.0487,4.3847,0.2462,0.3351,0.477,1.7003,1.0203,3.5451,0.9037,1.3627,3.4364,0.5543,0.7631,1.5512,0.1603,0.2844,1.4259,2.2413,7.5891,4.4887,9.7727,6.5912,1.2893,3.837,1.4193,1.9756,10.1119,4.0263,3.557,3.618,4.3022,2.0156,3.4342,3.2983,5.976,2.7535,4.3914,0.9931,3.2466,1.3312,2.3364,0.0026,3.0391,1.3013,1.6461,1.8452,4.4423,3.3829,0.2009,2.5391,5.0647,3.699,3.3675,5.4452,4.9148,1.0934,2.955,0.0002,8.4802,4.2797,0.8267,5.4285,5.4357,0.0007,3.6109,1.7856,0.1007,3.5441,5.7416,3.1338,3.0968,2.0393,0.2425,1.1568,2.5155,2.1178,2.1741,4.787,1.2732,1.0085,0.0002,1.3061,6.942,2.5166,5.5539,1.0483,2.1624,0.0324,5.2661,4.4168,2.0923,2.772,2.8678,2.21,4.0346,4.0022,1.5966,1.99,0.4833,0.8548,0.8675,0.0002,0.48,4.7975,0.7281,5.1402,2.401,0.0107,3.5513,1.6481,3.8534,0.0558,2.0207,2.7012,0.9298,5.0041,2.1344,0.2712,0.1728,2.7539,1.7788,0.5343,2.4231,5.3289,2.349,2.6802,3.3588,1.0449,2.22,0.351,0.0002,0.601,1.9249,7.4248,3.5975,6.0589,0.1509,3.8265,2.3045,5.6506,4.8397,5.5628,5.0935,2.6173,5.6817,2.7499,2.2138,1.7265,1.4298,1.7321,5.1462,0.6289,3.276,2.9512,2.0121,1.9531,4.1613,2.7924,2.4345,0.9455,6.0797,1.4861,5.3997,2.6599,0.5823,3.5906,3.4514,4.7893,0.5873,4.2163,0.4555,1.3845,4.7455,0.9002,5.1596,2.2647,2.0901,1.0229,4.004,0.4002,3.6811,3.5265,2.2175,2.2475,1.5083,5.1773,4.2665,6.1059,2.635,1.3369,4.0338,3.3679,1.5337,2.2297,3.4299,0.1842,2.1834,3.2364,5.2172,2.6798,5.1263,0.2016,2.3693,2.6037,5.8386,3.6289,5.8707,6.9162,0.915,0.7589,4.7399,5.7722,1.0684,0.7231,0.3687,0.7069,3.3871,4.753,0.0018,2.6788,0.1161,1.6276,4.8489,4.041,3.486,4.6593,0.6278,3.1429,5.2384,0.8756,0.2663,3.8419,3.012,0.6447,2.9633,0.8097,0.6577,3.8565,1.4782,4.7516,0.1435,3.3304,3.7922,4.3726,2.0285,5.4107,2.9127,1.3465,0.5155,1.7167,0.414,3.5858,0.001,5.2812,1.6242,2.7091,0.6293,4.0436,0.0007,4.3284,5.1353,2.8956,4.8007,1.1805,5.9005,2.8512,2.5756,1.9282,3.6951,5.3946,1.0829,2.1931,0.4341,0.1824,1.1043,0.0002,0.3171,4.9751,3.2844,2.5793,1.686,0.3562,2.0427,4.0623,2.2506,4.8269,5.8263,1.9307,5.8157,1.0815,4.5345,2.1045,1.3147,5.1409,2.6667,1.3813,2.6612,1.0505,5.3379,1.9053,0.4344,3.9933,1.1719,3.2307,1.9409,2.6524,4.1506,4.4499,1.5004,10.3429,7.4145,4.8306,0.004,0.8285,0.9565,0.0004,7.0482,4.5147,4.2754,5.6702,1.4873,0.0648,4.068,4.46,0.6732,0.4392,1.8898,3.8642,3.7936,5.5842,4.6254,4.7175,6.9978,2.7396,1.4622,6.0464,2.1143,1.4185,0.6187,0.0003,0.3352,1.2401,1.5261,1.3848,5.3022,3.3318,1.6744,5.2613,0.0767,1.5085,0.6433,1.8764,5.5876,5.9105,1.894,3.2901,3.0407,4.5697,3.9638,1.4825,1.0306,1.0494,2.8791,0.9666,1.8063,0.1926,0.6528,0.0002,0.2249,4.4249,5.9413,0.0009,2.6529,1.531,0.1709,1.2294,4.0694,5.4922,4.8403,3.6016,1.723,0.0003,0.2481,2.2965,3.2892,3.7324,2.1233,2.5397,1.5686,1.1236,3.7552,2.7782,2.8512,1.7708,4.162,0.7424,0.5534,0.0003,0.2227,2.4307,1.8569,3.1147,3.6238,2.227,3.6415,2.2499,3.3796,5.4242,5.0309,0.6524,1.9251,4.2232,1.1313,0.4186,0.0003,0.1952,1.9726,6.7389,1.5973,5.135,1.1915,6.4025,1.3619,1.7075,5.4305,3.8091,4.2596,4.2368,2.9904,5.1189,0.8598,0.6371,0.0002,0.2148,1.4167,1.7068,4.5254,3.0006,4.2992,4.8388,4.8883,2.7108,5.2091,5.1395,0.1861,3.1721,3.0902,2.2352,0.0726,2.2538,1.0719,0.3668,0.0003,0.1397,4.2967,6.5699,0.4082,0.0235,0.6895,2.6189,5.9597,4.9682,0.099,3.0027,2.6189,0.6265,0.4399,1.6845,0.4445,0.3255,2.1452,1.1454,1.3693,2.8868,5.7846,4.4698,5.2609,4.4032,1.0212,3.9858,0.3928,3.633,3.5488,2.8532,0.5715,3.0396]}

You'll have to make up for it. I knew those people you 'll have to blame too.\n\nThis wasn't done on purpose. You didn't make it right or even on purpose. If you 'll see them go away, they will. They have to watch you die again and again, but you're going to do it better. The problem is you will leave them with more than one of those. I know because I made myself suffer for years as a human with a mental disability.\n\nFor any one reading this post, know what a horrible life I've lived in the past five years. I won't lie, I wasn't a great person during your time, and you weren't what anyone could understand, so there's no getting around it. You weren't really a good person during the time you were living in California. I couldn't help telling you what really hurt you so much. I wouldn't call myself a person anymore.\n\nAnd that was until you were in a world where you were treated differently because of your disability. It was then that your life became so dangerous. You were sent into exile, where you were forced to make the tough decisions and try to find something that worked on your behalf. My life got cut short because of this decision.\n\nThere was nothing you could do. Everything was done to make it better. It was because of your disability that you went from a human being who loved to hate you. He was you, and he loved you for it.\n\nNow my life is changing. You have changed a lot. My life isn't ending. It is my life being saved.\n\nIf I didn't love those people, maybe you'd not remember what you did after you died. You might remember what you did after I died, and you'd be right. My last words. I want you to remember what I said.\n\nI won't ever forget your words.

{"id":4978,"ended":true,"length":472,"gen_text":"One day you decide to fake your death and with your last fake breath you hear an announcement saying `` Subject is dead. Expirement is over. ''\n\nHowever, that only explains the sudden change in tone. The other thing to keep in mind is that this seems like a very real and sudden death.\n\nWhen you have time, a lot of people might think that you have been dead for three or four times. But after coming and going through the mental breakdown and your brain being broken and broken and broken and broken, that's not actually true.\n\nA patient with brain damage will often go with two options:\n\nFirst of all, you have a very bad memory for things like where to go, with which areas the doctor will treat, what to do now. Then there's a second option...\n\nSecond option, you probably have too much stress.\n\nThis can be dangerous, especially for parents, who may never realize what will happen. It can also be completely unnatural and dangerous, which is why many people keep doing their very best to stay calm and make decisions, but not in any way in which they get too stressed from their emotions.\n\nAnother problem is that patients with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a common brain disease, can often die in their 30s or 40s because they are only allowed to talk when they are already \"dead.\"\n\nBut the best ways to treat the death of those who are already dead are to change the way they do things. The best way to do this is to stop trying to convince yourself that you have done something wrong and instead ask yourself:\n\nWould it make a difference, then, to the rest of your life what happened?\n\nIf this doesn't work, at least you can talk it out with the doctors yourself or your partner. If that fails, do it right. No doctor's call will tell you how to do things, because you will not remember what you did.\n\nMost people will also think that when you are dead, you are just \"removed\" from life, so when suddenly you get a call that says \"Subject is dead. Expirement is over.'' you have been dead for hours.\n\nThis has a lot of potential implications.\n\nBut there were a handful of people who actually could give you a real life and real medical care. I'm sure we will all be sad to die. But we won't want to forget.","token_len":506,"entropy":[6.8149,4.4261,6.0835,0.8984,9.5089,2.0211,2.7786,1.7755,7.1505,1.9446,5.0334,8.4629,4.8767,0.6664,5.2615,3.7732,3.9489,4.5052,11.0474,14.1815,4.5194,0.9837,1.3774,5.9621,6.9858,7.5637,1.2678,2.6327,0.4848,5.1525,1.9144,0.102,5.4517,0.4603,4.4639,4.2406,5.3044,1.5731,4.3314,2.0888,0.5062,2.4529,1.2735,2.3209,4.4784,3.6628,2.5339,2.5759,0.0244,0.003,0.2649,0.2928,2.5901,5.852,1.4695,0.7122,2.6744,3.7883,3.2063,5.6262,3.0055,0.8751,1.6985,0.0004,4.4139,1.3836,3.806,5.2037,2.2985,4.7501,2.9074,0.1897,0.8775,4.4444,2.2855,1.4891,1.4963,2.1446,2.329,2.2814,0.5041,4.6776,2.3575,0.0576,5.8632,0.996,1.9915,4.6149,6.0632,6.1467,1.0384,3.4757,1.374,5.3735,4.8383,2.1364,5.2801,5.129,3.3863,3.8049,2.367,3.6898,1.807,1.2502,1.6908,0.3067,0.935,2.8024,1.1123,0.8872,4.4322,0.3655,0.1434,1.1547,0.0002,4.2887,5.5079,2.1632,4.0227,1.251,2.7679,2.7173,3.726,6.0452,4.1564,5.0756,1.2085,1.4743,0.0003,4.4305,2.6064,0.0012,0.3834,2.13,3.0747,2.0173,3.3385,3.2682,2.2459,4.806,2.7693,2.1369,4.2774,2.0276,1.2466,1.7474,6.8616,2.4708,3.84,5.141,2.9862,3.3945,3.6655,1.2183,1.8185,1.0679,0.8619,5.3654,1.5595,3.1136,3.3303,1.0693,1.3028,3.6247,0.2204,4.8135,1.0428,0.0002,3.6008,1.364,1.2857,1.4243,6.0209,1.3962,5.4988,0.3585,4.329,1.6688,1.3531,0.0003,3.2624,3.5163,0.9189,5.4906,1.9777,1.9148,1.7478,6.295,2.1543,2.015,1.8586,5.3005,4.0266,2.3768,4.5064,0.1134,1.852,3.1873,1.3615,1.0338,1.012,5.9265,5.2633,2.0622,3.6752,2.381,3.1627,1.1088,0.5053,3.0939,1.2219,5.0851,4.0941,4.4422,5.4906,0.2249,0.1449,3.5394,1.5741,0.8322,5.1533,3.5839,3.5782,1.6728,3.8868,3.7699,4.92,0.8511,3.6649,5.226,0.7587,6.416,3.4349,2.9316,5.7079,2.3208,4.9805,0.4466,0.2097,0.0002,4.2736,3.2205,1.246,0.4855,4.4373,1.2347,3.9788,2.1863,0.0166,0.0,0.0105,0.6277,0.0391,0.0071,1.2258,1.6833,4.0648,1.7291,1.0042,0.7125,2.6548,4.0331,4.4009,2.4559,1.9661,3.6134,0.0438,1.1256,0.3819,0.0037,4.8949,1.0621,1.7495,5.8332,3.761,0.2199,4.5443,4.0777,0.4425,0.9377,5.0414,5.812,2.4097,0.8576,0.9738,0.0002,3.8103,3.0801,3.4696,6.149,0.1406,4.3056,3.0602,4.2624,0.307,5.5261,1.125,1.4956,2.1234,0.2566,0.7362,0.7295,5.1691,1.3757,0.9739,0.5323,4.4636,0.5359,1.231,3.3597,1.9611,0.2683,0.5956,0.469,1.0169,0.1304,0.341,3.6879,3.582,0.0713,4.0365,1.8239,0.4088,0.6948,2.0317,3.6032,0.9179,0.8949,1.7796,2.7206,4.657,0.1726,1.6028,1.6919,0.0005,4.6841,2.4462,2.6595,2.1304,0.1782,3.84,5.4367,0.3828,1.8789,3.5288,3.1341,0.0026,0.5771,0.1221,4.446,1.694,1.0159,0.6565,0.0003,2.225,4.407,3.1803,0.0003,1.3264,0.384,5.9446,0.3877,1.6186,1.3193,3.8828,2.831,0.7419,1.9976,2.4692,2.8349,5.8386,4.4133,4.1102,5.2239,0.5958,2.802,3.5394,3.6751,0.2109,4.6386,1.4148,3.4135,1.2271,6.0,3.3451,4.3348,4.9868,2.65,2.3452,0.0486,2.9612,0.4821,1.3249,2.8875,2.4113,3.5761,1.8364,2.1655,2.6651,4.5768,1.6083,2.0199,0.5365,0.9452,0.7087,0.0003,5.5182,1.0769,2.4181,4.0106,3.1567,0.6031,4.2215,1.5187,2.3469,1.0345,0.7033,0.798,1.0272,2.9538,3.4328,5.6655,0.9135,0.8489,0.189,2.0056,2.0492,3.1099,4.6107,7.6586,0.732,3.4553,2.0463,1.2693,2.8092,1.6499,1.775,1.9744,0.2772,0.1202,1.9211,0.1498,0.0415,0.001,0.0097,0.0209,3.3923,8.3339,3.1356,2.7872,1.4576,0.5607,4.7013,0.9102,0.8999,0.0003,2.6388,5.0415,2.4204,1.4098,0.7102,3.3455,4.0522,1.5157,1.7916,0.0001,3.5154,3.3348,6.5618,1.792,5.4086,0.0365,1.9451,0.4242,2.7879,4.887,5.6246,1.2518,1.1678,2.5493,2.4869,4.005,2.6629,5.0363,3.605,1.0502,3.439,2.6841,1.693,4.0626,2.5522,1.9527,1.4767,4.6734,1.847,5.7123,2.5641,1.8732,2.3716,2.811,0.0004,3.4878,0.1358,4.8228,1.5151]}

Footprints and evidence found at the scene suggest this act of violence was committed by a 2nd Sasquatch.\n\n. The body appears to have been mutilated in a fashion similar to that of a human. In November 2011, a 5 year old Sasquatch disappeared. The body was found by a neighbor of the family. The family has been searching for the missing teenager for 5 years after finding and killing him during a public holiday in the mountains on April 10th 2011.\n\n. The corpse found has no body or headstone or any kind of markings. On the body were:\n\n1. 3 mm blackened spiky bone fragments (from a skull.)\n\n2. A human hand which matched any identified or suspected Sasquatch's.\n\n3. A small rock (2 inches in diameter) with little hair (1\/3 size) found inside. Also found and identified are:\n\n1) a severed hand blade.\n\n2) a broken hand, similar to that of a Sasquatch\n\n4) A bone in the left hand which is known to be from the body found.\n\n5) A large bone in the right hand.\n\nThere is a possibility the body might even be of some kind of adult male. The body may have been kept there under cover of snow, or if it was there was a human body and human tail.\n\nAn unknown species of Sasquatch exists in Alaska. They resemble that of Bigfoot. As documented recently in The Huffington Post, the Sasquatch will only attack and attack humans in their natural habitat (where they are very, very difficult to distinguish). In spite of what our scientists are saying about this \"missing\" human, the body is not found in their natural habitat.\n\nWhat do you think of this case, where an extremely large specimen from Northern Alaska escaped capture by the locals, and found its way to the US and USA? Share it in the comments below with your own thoughts about this case, if you know more about these people, and any others you might care to share on the case. Don't forget the big \"K\" of the link.

They try to get as far away from New York as possible, but are attacked by a force traveling across the world that would use the Power Matrix to turn the Apocalypse, then break into the city using its power on mutants and their friends.\n\nWolverine is the only character present when the real X-Men arrive in New York and are killed by the Anti-Monitor. He's able to fight X-Factor on purpose, but is captured by Scarlet Witch. The two X-Men then meet up with the new Captain America, who he is learning about as a sidekick.\n\nMarvel's Uncanny X-Men begins publication at issue #30, the #9 issue series of the same year. The Uncanny X-Men were featured in a limited edition book series in 2010. The collection included the original three issues of Uncanny X-Men and the Uncanny X-Men #50, and the latest volume, X-Factor #1.","token_len":507,"entropy":[8.2063,4.7395,7.9878,9.3235,4.1801,2.1512,6.1058,2.6138,0.2669,8.6144,4.9297,1.995,6.9301,1.0585,2.7249,0.0154,3.4674,2.9217,10.2173,4.55,2.5033,0.9379,3.413,0.3433,1.1087,8.1664,2.6405,1.6785,5.9235,4.3613,8.8888,8.8422,3.73,1.1943,5.8964,0.0182,5.4835,0.5617,0.0013,0.0,0.7162,2.1383,5.3756,2.0722,1.2947,4.7356,0.011,0.9769,2.8496,2.2854,5.2899,5.3123,2.9025,3.3158,2.462,3.3475,0.746,1.6742,0.6387,5.525,4.7398,1.9495,2.226,0.7631,0.7928,2.8273,2.2178,2.5799,4.745,1.0186,0.8906,1.8239,2.2668,0.0457,4.721,3.9824,0.6243,0.0003,0.2833,0.0002,4.0956,4.6729,0.0873,0.0623,3.0993,0.0062,0.0003,2.218,0.0051,0.0002,1.358,4.5499,1.0941,1.4815,1.8798,3.731,5.6381,2.1338,0.276,1.6969,4.3879,0.0119,3.9211,5.2908,5.3967,2.2687,3.4147,0.6959,5.9027,1.4896,4.0246,0.0325,3.2543,3.1364,2.0494,1.1237,1.1447,1.7938,5.7256,4.0362,0.8149,5.0552,3.3451,1.2443,5.7816,0.0213,2.9553,0.3722,1.1325,2.3147,5.0402,0.0909,4.0015,0.0577,1.4034,0.7157,1.3659,5.8949,4.8487,2.4977,2.3242,0.5486,2.2627,3.0147,6.0447,0.1104,2.045,0.7272,2.1339,0.0002,2.6649,0.2831,2.8738,5.8567,4.3507,0.9387,0.1538,3.1861,5.2102,0.2969,0.5957,4.3757,4.6098,0.1204,1.0455,4.8896,7.3479,1.9037,2.3302,4.9751,4.252,1.3728,5.0639,2.3753,4.877,1.298,4.9455,0.0815,6.1653,5.4189,4.2726,2.16,2.5722,1.1113,5.1205,0.0487,1.7229,0.6903,5.2963,1.1186,0.0002,3.4291,2.1773,5.4872,4.7932,1.5953,1.2082,3.5987,0.7134,4.7333,3.1229,0.0015,1.5952,3.488,0.3495,6.8368,0.0023,2.9589,0.2093,2.2934,3.3604,5.2419,0.1363,3.3647,4.0472,6.0349,1.2124,1.4364,4.864,4.1748,3.8143,3.8837,2.0571,5.6141,0.1493,1.3373,1.2907,4.2779,0.0029,1.9577,0.6887,3.4648,4.3864,3.1625,1.3586,4.9689,5.1381,5.6641,0.8288,3.6151,1.6298,3.1512,0.6319,0.0002,3.2804,3.3153,0.6756,0.4922,2.6265,3.4014,4.104,0.6429,3.3516,4.9312,5.3358,2.2061,0.0579,1.4949,3.7546,0.0177,0.2476,1.3221,2.6044,5.6056,0.4431,5.3418,1.6013,2.7398,2.2856,3.2033,5.5855,2.8562,0.662,0.0,1.829,3.1489,2.3562,0.0021,0.5343,5.649,1.0627,1.4423,2.2674,0.0287,0.1045,3.5484,2.6825,4.2536,0.5381,2.5474,5.3918,1.5602,1.0935,1.4741,0.1808,1.3182,2.1653,7.7913,2.0399,4.6932,2.8632,2.4804,1.5009,4.4053,2.7721,6.8578,0.0776,0.0122,0.3435,0.9216,4.6756,4.334,0.1694,3.4915,5.7939,1.1887,1.428,0.2393,5.6911,0.9051,0.3136,0.1516,0.4442,0.3693,1.631,2.1825,0.1264,1.7476,4.5119,6.0542,3.5796,0.3321,3.2003,2.5302,5.0336,4.0127,1.6854,5.8083,4.6851,0.5308,3.7825,1.9535,6.2323,5.1689,5.779,5.4962,1.5587,1.4886,2.0342,5.4983,4.4459,1.5461,5.699,2.0697,2.6621,3.2432,1.8403,0.2218,1.0948,0.0002,4.8024,0.0013,0.0036,2.2061,4.1097,1.3822,3.5899,5.405,1.812,1.1864,5.5863,0.9334,0.0076,0.496,2.0216,2.245,0.5779,0.072,2.8482,3.0816,4.7821,0.7581,1.2436,5.6374,0.0339,0.6403,0.8523,2.5461,4.2874,4.297,0.0082,4.4101,5.5315,0.0074,0.1231,4.2883,5.7799,0.5583,0.797,1.4641,4.6353,0.459,5.2385,0.0044,1.6,2.6698,2.9724,3.8612,0.0019,0.0562,3.6982,3.1102,1.2573,0.627,1.3757,3.8203,4.4831,0.1486,0.8086,1.0736,4.1926,3.3509,5.2613,1.1043,3.2358,1.7663,4.2068,0.548,0.6619,1.1062,0.0002,3.8718,1.9147,4.6859,0.0002,0.2658,0.0062,0.0271,5.727,6.3694,5.292,1.4706,0.8105,5.2666,1.2289,3.98,4.3931,4.2526,0.7141,4.4495,3.2855,1.4207,2.1819,3.0317,0.3365,2.6248,2.8666,0.0011,0.0606,0.0042,0.0055,4.1284,5.2657,0.3857,2.7891,3.6727,2.0047,4.2498,2.5819,1.8487,4.657,1.0346,2.308,5.017,3.9229,2.2432,3.6447,4.6565,2.1096,0.8953,0.9608,0.0007,0.0487,0.0098,0.0113,2.5238,1.3926,3.0268,0.0008,0.3146,0.0201,0.0562,1.9278,4.9373,1.3393,2.2433,1.3553,5.6205,4.2562,1.4836,3.7474,0.0307,0.9398,0.8537,2.4807,0.6612]}

In a post-apocalyptic world, they strive to fulfil their original programming.\n\nHowever, that hope is coming to an end on Friday, when the moderator for AskReddit's \/r\/AskReddit will announce that the site will stop accepting bots. The site said earlier this week that once people find out about bots on \/r\/AskReddit, they will lose their account and join a bot mailing list on the site. According to Googles, the bot-list is currently in its infancy, but has been getting used with the community.\n\nThe site also added that the moderators would be replacing the AMA moderators with \"subreddit administrators who will give advice on new and existing bots.\"\n\nWhen asked what moderators the moderators want to change to, moderator and moderator-in-chief Gabby Douglas told us that it would be the admins, who would be the ones who will change, that would go in a \"fresh direction\".\n\n\"The moderators of the AMA won't change,\" he said, \"although I know admins will be on the outside. As for some new stuff, like the subreddit list, we'll discuss that.\"\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Speaks Through Slack\n\nAlso Read: Reddit Gets Another Huge Changeover in Days\n\nThe moderators will begin accepting submissions on their r\/bitcoin subreddit, where users can post questions, critiques and criticism on the site.\n\nAnd in response to a thread that included user information, Reddit asked community members to please check out this r\/bitcoin-reddit.\n\nIf you want to send in your own r\/Bitcoin-reddit posts, head over to \/r\/bitcoin-reddit. On Thursday, users at \/r\/Bitcoin-reddit have received a bunch of messages from people saying that they wished the site moved to r\/Bitcoin, which they said is one of many different sub subreddits.\n\nThe subreddit started out being a place for people to write r\/Bitcoin \/r\/Bitcoin, but over time, people have started sharing ideas for how to help it run. Some are even offering free mods to the subreddit.\n\nThe Reddit community isn't giving up. The Reddit Community Network, created by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, said Thursday that the only way the Reddit community should survive is by contributing to r\/bitcoin, but we will not stop there. Reddit is trying to create more than 1 billion unique subscribers.","token_len":508,"entropy":[7.1211,4.0412,0.7031,0.9814,11.5246,2.2555,7.781,5.3964,2.9663,1.6784,8.4813,4.4093,10.1727,5.5769,1.4089,3.4311,2.8992,3.4208,6.3986,2.4344,0.0527,1.1707,0.8391,2.8433,9.0815,0.086,8.6342,1.0629,5.0902,5.6456,2.6648,1.0088,0.0003,4.9598,0.0735,4.4671,5.2887,1.2968,4.743,0.1371,0.1712,0.0326,3.6353,2.8974,1.2088,0.3267,1.5146,6.1838,2.959,5.9489,0.562,3.0623,4.1763,0.0169,0.0014,1.3806,0.0557,1.7719,3.2941,1.0348,1.4717,2.0106,0.9199,3.7544,2.1117,1.0719,1.2363,2.0561,2.2467,4.1499,4.3814,0.437,0.6893,0.2274,6.8963,4.1322,3.4715,0.9864,1.6075,2.1563,2.6435,3.0925,0.0015,0.0008,0.12,0.0076,0.3372,0.613,0.71,5.6572,0.713,4.1434,1.9175,5.6403,1.6909,1.882,6.0058,0.0092,5.0039,1.7708,1.0636,0.3818,6.1346,0.0019,6.0768,1.4012,3.3042,0.5004,1.1912,1.8656,3.3517,3.2388,2.2942,2.9365,3.759,1.8715,2.1289,1.1576,1.0882,3.6643,1.672,4.4683,3.9334,5.3065,2.0817,3.4891,0.8632,0.3269,0.0002,2.1861,2.7175,2.8638,3.9326,0.5343,1.902,2.3497,4.3078,1.3054,4.7873,1.5234,5.6592,3.5719,1.7504,2.9859,5.3981,0.7606,3.2379,2.771,1.579,4.9609,3.7641,1.3448,3.8533,2.8045,2.0524,2.2746,1.3511,0.9298,0.0002,5.1822,0.4224,2.5279,4.1361,3.2022,1.3581,3.7906,0.8469,4.2692,3.5308,0.949,3.3805,4.3309,1.1169,4.1013,2.7662,0.0626,0.7918,5.2881,0.6791,1.0689,2.1655,4.2971,1.0582,3.3711,1.6542,0.3507,2.628,4.2269,2.9124,3.2384,1.4568,1.5638,2.3633,0.9903,1.3139,3.2011,3.667,4.207,2.6221,1.8103,5.1729,2.4328,3.7372,1.885,6.0236,0.7361,4.0173,0.5115,0.0001,1.4019,2.3832,1.6263,2.4548,2.526,2.6131,6.3145,0.007,2.7054,2.436,0.9757,0.5753,1.7311,1.1146,5.2137,2.8143,3.4382,6.3665,1.5077,1.986,4.0844,0.9104,5.6085,2.8738,4.4565,2.5272,6.0025,2.8962,4.8309,0.5405,4.9957,2.2331,3.8739,5.535,0.5374,1.6735,1.1295,5.4022,1.6987,2.4624,0.2717,0.0002,5.528,1.3995,0.0882,6.0996,4.9747,1.1998,6.091,6.2886,2.2592,0.0003,4.5445,0.892,0.0143,1.9674,4.8334,5.5127,5.1102,5.1122,1.5769,2.6635,5.2616,0.5145,0.0002,2.1724,2.018,2.159,5.0941,1.2248,2.2854,1.3317,4.8773,5.9502,0.0108,2.1617,0.762,1.6381,2.3612,1.5634,0.2479,1.6782,1.5921,1.8119,5.2802,1.015,4.8535,2.2842,0.7682,0.4344,0.6001,1.4886,0.0002,4.7869,3.4401,4.1211,0.1369,2.1433,4.5968,3.1538,4.1209,5.5565,4.2745,1.4728,1.9174,5.3681,5.9762,0.1399,0.3455,4.8088,4.4466,0.5808,3.8837,5.8794,0.0022,0.7736,4.4762,2.4725,2.2657,0.774,0.0001,3.9495,0.3,2.6353,0.0833,4.2414,2.209,1.1365,1.6079,3.2078,0.0051,2.8701,1.6594,0.3238,3.5216,0.4596,3.2611,0.4803,0.0878,0.8067,0.0025,0.0017,1.2621,1.4967,0.0666,1.5581,6.129,2.9536,0.3284,3.3005,5.8618,0.8296,0.0051,0.0017,1.02,0.5513,0.0969,5.4856,3.8461,1.1624,4.8524,0.0231,3.2142,1.3937,2.9778,3.2763,1.3152,0.8242,6.0589,1.7713,1.2844,6.8678,0.8273,2.6818,0.0038,1.2953,2.141,2.5017,1.9675,2.7326,0.9906,4.6502,0.0861,4.3707,5.4034,3.8435,4.8444,1.329,0.4486,0.0001,2.4484,1.1772,5.241,2.3906,4.2436,1.1886,2.0691,0.5872,1.8794,0.3076,5.152,3.08,0.0129,0.3936,6.7081,0.333,0.0032,0.3495,1.7604,1.3744,2.9326,0.4801,1.0025,3.3825,1.562,1.3814,4.6495,4.4982,2.4461,2.9308,0.2222,4.6117,3.6429,5.0128,1.3073,4.0342,3.5998,2.9882,4.2688,2.3903,5.8605,1.7377,2.8302,1.1948,0.9128,0.3887,0.0001,2.3653,2.98,1.9265,4.7101,0.0009,6.0365,0.0701,2.047,2.3393,3.4799,4.3254,5.5184,1.6176,4.1537,0.3384,1.7147,2.3499,0.3982,0.066,0.4101,0.0018,0.0,0.3959,4.3442,4.8018,0.288,1.9789,6.2532,0.8839,2.3228,3.3699,0.3208,5.2366,2.0407,0.5909,3.2321,4.6647,0.4475,2.2571,0.0036,1.5334,1.9288,2.9693,5.7473,3.3306,3.4013,1.4908,1.7456,0.1008,3.7036,2.2011,4.9176,0.1542,3.5414,4.0436,2.9918,2.7022,2.6851,3.1362,4.2753,2.1077]}

As far as there is available data here about the size of the known galactic community, they are quite large.\n\nThey may be the oldest species in the Milky Way galaxy, so we know that some of the oldest civilizations are based on large galaxies and that some have billions of light years.\n\nWhat are the implications of this evidence, if any?\n\nOne question has only now been answered, is the current light speed flight is similar to the distance from the human civilization.\n\nEven though there is no evidence that the human civilization is at a distance then as far as we know the speed of light is the same as for previous civilizations, and it is about 9 times faster\n\nMore data could be made about the history of the light speed flight, so in light speed this may be very important at the beginning of the human history.\n\nFurthermore the study of the past could help to inform new discoveries.\n\nThe light speed flight we see today is just one of many possible possibilities!\n\nExplore further: Humans traveling through light-speed space\n\nMore information: A study by Drs. Dr. Huay G. Lee and Dr. Thomas S\u00fcthler shows that light speed flight is less than 4 billion years ago. This time period was known only about 10,000 years before the human civilization reached our galaxy The study shows that the modern light speed flight is now at about 2 years ago.","token_len":509,"entropy":[2.6222,5.185,6.4683,6.0197,7.0741,0.1154,5.0904,0.004,8.7556,3.159,7.2224,3.2264,0.8196,3.1113,4.4983,11.4145,12.118,5.3329,0.3002,8.2367,7.2771,3.6506,0.1845,4.19,0.8958,8.0604,0.3177,1.5339,0.9395,10.0663,8.3977,2.8018,1.4836,5.7776,1.236,3.6344,6.3062,4.0169,1.5797,8.4594,1.2676,1.3463,1.734,13.6036,1.1651,0.7517,5.4775,3.5554,2.002,2.5617,5.1488,1.3084,2.0741,0.0769,3.4796,6.7371,2.0793,2.6485,1.6341,3.9042,2.2998,5.9152,1.0862,2.5046,5.1019,3.4649,1.4716,4.7367,1.0309,1.4201,1.3442,1.3459,2.1521,3.9905,0.1346,1.5686,2.5994,2.5374,4.5978,0.6595,1.2939,4.682,3.0796,0.5658,1.6448,0.0002,5.3359,5.1787,3.5871,4.5956,1.6264,2.2464,0.78,3.6958,1.6722,4.4537,2.2194,0.5196,0.0002,5.6785,1.6722,3.724,1.5674,3.9085,3.521,5.2338,1.5166,0.0195,3.7126,5.8966,3.5644,4.928,4.5251,2.77,1.9354,2.991,5.685,6.601,1.1523,2.1906,1.1697,3.7864,4.7271,0.3395,2.6584,0.7213,2.1845,3.2581,2.1258,4.3228,3.4523,3.23,3.7115,4.154,2.1339,2.8284,2.6671,1.842,5.1769,2.1856,4.9008,2.1715,5.6036,1.011,7.7123,1.8966,2.0534,4.8707,5.388,2.1512,1.5509,2.3066,2.8625,0.4266,1.9484,1.4474,0.4515,0.6512,0.0002,4.0296,3.2206,0.7919,2.2599,0.0697,1.291,1.1373,1.922,1.8631,0.423,2.3517,2.3211,4.5252,5.2649,1.781,4.4912,2.2093,3.3723,2.1454,2.0584,2.7769,2.8731,5.4309,1.7781,4.5697,4.2367,4.8492,6.1544,1.3791,4.6278,1.5266,1.393,2.0731,4.6095,2.8892,5.6767,3.8708,1.0039,0.8685,0.0292,0.6328,0.6171,0.0002,4.4942,5.1184,2.878,4.6825,5.3591,5.0652,1.0584,4.1588,4.6797,0.8274,4.1554,4.5523,3.0163,1.5019,3.8429,1.2721,5.0395,3.9703,0.0549,5.8957,0.6366,5.0118,2.1126,6.3707,3.6724,0.9639,3.688,0.2555,0.4603,5.9476,4.1616,4.2607,0.6316,4.6033,1.3574,3.3604,1.8407,1.2261,1.0639,0.0002,5.5835,3.3802,1.2002,2.8611,3.0654,4.8387,2.0665,0.4611,3.0543,0.0017,0.922,1.0695,3.8006,2.8015,2.3853,1.0338,4.3115,0.8343,0.9616,2.004,2.3009,1.8873,5.0611,1.0442,4.1307,3.4018,2.4565,2.0194,1.7099,3.742,5.6833,0.1101,2.5385,0.1359,1.7522,0.7743,0.0002,2.6602,1.8714,0.4442,2.2452,0.5321,1.0942,5.7142,3.2548,2.1882,0.6071,0.8762,0.1216,0.0001,3.9739,3.61,4.4914,6.7007,5.3782,0.8206,0.7339,1.3845,3.3135,1.8633,5.0525,5.3006,0.0975,6.217,3.4103,5.5038,0.0949,1.109,5.8106,1.7572,1.1815,5.5542,1.469,2.8227,1.2459,0.0002,5.2298,0.8232,2.488,0.7727,1.4512,1.9177,1.1774,1.5407,1.9153,0.0993,1.6626,2.0749,0.4714,2.5591,6.1045,5.7841,1.0323,0.0882,0.7504,0.274,2.2466,2.028,0.6781,0.1294,0.9169,3.2362,0.2979,0.8538,4.3209,5.6941,0.312,1.8382,1.9759,2.484,0.7531,4.8787,4.5611,2.0219,0.7287,5.6113,0.0002,5.5334,3.7049,3.4676,0.5215,4.1142,1.8067,0.7684,4.6565,0.1698,0.9349,3.0123,0.1228,0.7972,1.4899,3.1801,3.9132,4.6207,0.2955,5.1197,3.2004,1.1388,2.8323,1.243,6.2947,1.4707,3.0706,0.4878,0.6168,2.0141,2.7069,0.5559,0.2591,0.0002,5.8489,2.5741,5.2613,0.3762,1.0192,3.8807,2.4916,1.8322,1.5814,4.3835,3.1976,1.5379,2.205,0.7025,0.0002,2.7593,3.7591,0.0495,0.8686,5.6953,2.1136,1.31,1.0451,4.047,1.8314,0.9699,0.4086,3.2604,2.6799,6.0619,0.3904,0.0003,4.1652,0.1451,0.004,4.9955,5.89,4.0001,4.7702,2.8098,0.1891,2.7765,2.0798,0.0003,0.0002,0.0038,0.0159,3.74,3.2972,3.7108,3.965,3.7056,0.4682,4.6032,0.3446,5.5333,5.5378,5.6052,1.5097,4.5076,0.6082,0.5441,0.4272,4.8975,3.1811,7.672,4.4451,4.5554,3.3857,0.4091,2.03,0.2475,0.669,1.2798,5.6086,1.4676,4.0795,2.6118,0.6206,1.5149,1.2494,4.5177,4.4461,1.0088,2.6135,4.6547,3.6539,4.2567,2.3688,1.5634,0.3602,0.2362,1.9507,1.1243,1.625,0.2169,4.2442,3.6838,1.1197,8.0598,1.9497,2.7552,0.1773,1.3818,5.5709,1.3601,0.1769,0.2306,1.1984,5.3683,3.7135,2.2848,3.0838,5.2486,1.9048,0.8098]}
{"id":3123,"ended":true,"length":496,"gen_text":"Aliens landed on earth, and they're surprised all humans possess what they think of as a superpower... an ability we always took for granted and consider normal... but one that only the humans really know and fear. Their power to turn others' faces into objects is extremely valuable and therefore should never be underestimated.\nAnthropogists, it seems, are also extremely adept at manipulating those we know and fear. This is part of his plan and is why so many have made the same comments on what he has predicted he might do: If we could only find the answers to this question better than we found our way from the earth, who would we be if we were to take on a new challenge? Perhaps some of our children will learn the answers to that question for their own personal benefit.\nAs a scientist, I can tell you the truth about the nature of our future. Everything that we have can be considered to be some sort of a new development, which means it is unlikely there will ever be anything we have taken for granted that will give some form of a reason for living in the future, or even in any way we really think of it. As for some new technologies, like artificial intelligence, it has to do with our current expectations, because we already know where they might lead. And so, this is also something that can only change the way we think about the future. This 'cautious' attitude is what makes us so excited about artificial intelligence; there is always a chance that something very special or even more magical is about to happen.\nPerhaps it will help to have our future carefully scrutinised and managed by a smart team who will be using it to uncover and prevent future problems. In light of what our scientists are saying and what I've witnessed, there is little doubt that humans are in very real ways capable of becoming more intelligent than we are, and may even surpass them.\nIf we make progress toward those goals, maybe we will not only take the future out of those who think it is 'overcome' (as they say). This is certainly possible, but I think it will help us, because not all future human civilizations will be as successful as we would like. My hope is that scientists and technologists who work in the real world, not on a daily basis, will be able to discover some sort of magic or have a real alternative to the current situation being attempted, that we will not need to rely on what we now think about the future to solve our real problems.","token_len":510,"entropy":[9.9962,9.8648,1.5502,5.2045,2.3211,1.9667,2.7965,4.8293,8.0184,6.9534,7.7345,7.7715,5.5436,1.0926,3.8975,2.0354,0.0952,1.7778,5.5926,4.9777,6.0616,2.242,6.6454,6.7132,7.3536,0.1296,0.001,3.9106,7.122,6.0251,4.1373,1.4671,4.1156,0.9523,4.1332,2.8152,2.9466,5.0797,1.6611,3.6381,5.6424,0.6605,4.7405,4.7016,3.4896,3.9219,3.9888,3.825,4.4324,0.9395,5.4063,2.0402,5.585,4.2863,2.4506,6.4856,5.8695,2.5229,0.1522,0.6512,0.4349,1.5673,7.9462,4.0576,7.2604,4.5019,2.8601,4.9105,1.1543,0.0964,1.4653,4.2678,4.1315,3.8287,0.0674,1.8354,5.4642,4.4956,2.1543,0.9639,0.9071,0.8263,3.7741,1.2485,5.3645,0.0209,6.6493,3.9809,4.6965,2.8108,1.5718,4.7444,0.1477,3.4718,4.944,1.8451,4.1714,6.2436,3.5972,4.8576,2.1633,2.4778,6.6309,6.0612,3.5548,1.2247,3.1405,5.4588,2.3778,3.6307,3.4927,3.268,2.4235,5.0294,0.6917,3.4304,1.0503,6.348,1.4904,1.5914,3.5515,3.6382,2.3167,4.4709,1.5183,5.2216,0.522,4.4789,0.8491,0.7969,0.2898,4.8469,0.2211,1.8544,1.7741,4.4219,2.4968,2.2778,2.4925,2.7861,0.7744,5.0782,4.0354,0.9975,2.6426,5.8723,1.9578,2.7726,2.6316,2.3328,0.7539,2.2282,0.1604,5.1974,2.4855,0.9322,3.8254,1.4115,0.8884,1.0534,4.2457,2.779,3.4295,0.4391,0.7352,2.577,1.5936,0.027,3.6753,1.9979,1.9898,1.8232,2.8792,0.0432,1.8052,5.8098,0.7163,5.577,1.962,1.056,3.185,5.4963,0.5319,4.935,2.9039,0.2231,5.4523,1.3728,0.0017,5.0498,5.1024,4.5513,1.5513,4.0578,1.9705,2.8485,1.5847,4.5109,4.4095,0.3596,0.7871,0.0498,2.8111,2.375,3.2612,6.2017,0.6441,0.0047,2.0095,2.5534,4.6936,7.0336,2.9618,0.1269,3.1163,2.556,0.9731,4.5233,2.8525,0.7585,0.3736,3.0939,1.5522,1.6061,4.347,3.8034,1.6651,4.7166,5.5377,3.154,0.6829,2.2603,0.7798,3.8945,3.3386,5.5495,4.8236,2.4507,0.8691,3.7693,2.9331,0.0839,0.4632,2.6216,3.3599,3.0219,1.8664,0.0494,2.4543,3.2292,5.1883,2.4205,4.0928,1.9427,4.1781,1.3393,5.2584,2.8499,4.2174,1.2783,1.7078,3.4284,3.2106,1.607,4.4641,1.1802,5.3966,3.4318,0.6765,3.7537,1.4849,5.7275,2.5592,2.2907,0.248,0.6314,0.5196,1.58,0.239,0.6277,4.2836,7.2964,5.8134,3.9624,0.0452,2.455,2.4333,1.7252,2.5022,1.7395,1.9063,1.0456,4.7103,0.6383,5.681,0.0461,4.6177,4.707,0.7198,3.6363,1.5654,1.3521,0.7921,1.609,4.3938,2.1113,3.2595,2.3198,3.9015,5.6688,3.3844,2.3461,0.0004,0.7158,0.9667,0.9452,4.9721,2.6416,2.1026,4.8146,1.8736,2.3819,3.8848,3.4304,6.033,4.992,1.3289,1.9498,4.8213,1.8905,2.0365,5.1061,3.9764,3.657,1.474,1.9495,6.0399,1.8121,0.6848,4.8775,2.8932,4.9058,1.6678,2.0655,0.7369,3.7207,6.6139,0.0026,2.909,4.235,4.6646,2.2571,1.2959,3.2443,0.9592,3.9042,2.0541,4.0177,1.1293,3.9423,0.7775,3.4401,0.3275,0.2641,4.0055,1.3499,3.9199,4.7596,2.9849,8.0397,2.6585,0.0199,4.7499,2.5753,1.3427,1.5807,0.6543,1.3355,1.9692,1.0896,5.2785,0.7531,2.4502,2.3728,0.93,1.3942,3.6136,1.1925,5.7579,2.575,3.815,4.4185,0.4154,0.354,4.4515,1.0509,0.9235,4.3801,0.9677,4.9752,2.221,4.7054,5.8843,0.0375,3.5183,1.7351,3.4037,1.1326,0.8544,5.087,4.8298,3.7212,1.238,3.8459,2.4112,2.3795,1.9963,4.1143,4.3765,1.0379,4.0045,1.9712,0.7745,0.9318,2.8744,2.1413,1.0875,2.0902,4.7843,1.2158,5.2802,2.6775,5.3272,2.0474,3.7463,4.418,3.4321,0.8218,0.7535,1.9392,3.7007,0.3545,0.8803,3.4825,0.1538,1.5059,5.7449,1.823,0.1727,0.0918,5.5111,1.949,2.8093,0.0228,2.5391,3.2187,1.6047,1.4362,3.9595,0.023,2.3345,3.6937,3.0267,1.8156,4.8909,0.0137,0.0931,0.3329,1.9622,0.3182,0.007,4.3064,3.6238,4.4304,0.0008,3.4381,2.8975,5.2794,1.7893,4.0906,5.8136,0.4008,1.2853,1.4514,3.5621,6.8636,5.1434,3.0247,4.4678,2.1879,2.3714,2.0714,3.8245,0.4815,3.1206,0.1952,4.1656,1.0234,4.4685,2.548,3.2009,1.2175,0.1191,1.5046,2.6986,1.0404,4.6807,0.1456,0.2525]}

He has been in the process of building a case for me to try to do, where we might get some extra money if we make that deal happen.\n\nSo let us take it from here.\n\nI am so grateful for the opportunity to walk around this city taking pictures for a living. I've been so used to seeing what I can do when I visit.\n\nI can walk around and check the mail. I can open up my door without even seeing you, and be safe.\n\nThis is just the start. That is all I have to say about this story. Thank you, the city.","token_len":511,"entropy":[11.1338,4.7167,8.6391,1.7229,2.0456,8.0632,5.753,7.0998,11.7503,4.5781,9.054,2.1193,7.6364,1.5367,1.9427,1.4997,0.5403,4.3433,2.6864,1.8133,13.4811,1.6116,7.0033,2.0518,3.6685,3.4144,3.339,1.9862,4.9658,6.6726,8.7663,2.7639,2.1954,5.7804,8.8748,6.3336,0.481,4.7557,1.2347,4.8434,4.4294,3.1122,8.2702,8.2057,2.4739,2.2076,3.4697,1.2835,1.0442,1.6244,0.0556,3.5028,2.9999,1.6925,5.5252,1.261,4.1685,2.8074,6.0378,3.6183,4.3546,1.5618,3.4694,2.7006,2.8692,4.0814,1.9299,3.2538,1.2318,2.9322,0.3147,1.4539,0.0002,4.0205,4.8584,1.0669,3.5678,2.5134,3.7132,3.0427,5.0407,0.5573,3.4044,2.9202,1.9948,1.8388,3.8575,0.6889,1.895,0.0002,4.0347,4.9279,0.0011,1.0966,0.4998,0.1585,2.096,3.2085,1.2852,1.8731,2.1782,2.3444,1.076,4.0618,0.6226,1.4794,0.0002,2.4401,5.5228,0.1813,1.0969,4.6547,0.6579,5.2148,0.0022,4.9738,3.2952,3.2289,1.1364,1.1485,0.9735,3.4408,3.4466,0.6516,3.2833,1.8457,3.7286,2.039,4.3984,3.0429,2.3495,2.7521,2.6016,2.5924,1.43,0.7813,0.0001,3.9761,3.4538,0.7454,0.4338,3.4738,5.1456,3.2116,2.2532,0.1922,1.0064,1.2812,1.703,4.8939,2.4565,4.7529,3.4981,3.1022,2.0442,5.1034,5.9501,0.0301,1.5122,3.9562,0.0002,4.6659,1.2397,0.8689,0.0002,2.9943,1.8437,2.939,5.6414,4.3649,1.6875,1.7152,0.7746,5.4012,5.5567,3.0369,5.3321,2.8085,3.9617,2.9941,0.0002,0.8639,0.7123,0.0002,5.9999,0.9539,1.5773,5.1601,3.7154,2.2234,4.3225,5.1264,2.774,0.0003,3.5584,2.9463,5.7074,5.5942,0.1309,0.0009,5.7091,2.8903,0.7199,1.6774,0.6317,5.0006,3.1399,1.8704,3.0804,0.1268,2.3411,0.0951,3.5113,1.5875,1.3217,0.717,3.734,0.6007,5.8128,5.1579,3.4072,0.755,0.4016,0.0002,5.328,0.6183,3.3885,4.6856,2.3046,2.0667,3.2363,3.2566,0.7566,2.9853,3.9642,4.7859,0.0038,1.3993,2.7093,0.1936,1.8499,3.0291,2.3456,0.046,2.8461,1.6811,0.4827,0.3195,3.1878,2.536,1.9824,4.9123,1.8184,3.7232,3.3873,4.9573,4.1837,5.4382,2.6707,4.5417,2.7454,0.431,0.756,0.4065,0.0002,2.2259,3.9568,2.581,2.9397,2.7533,2.1168,5.3134,2.3718,1.1858,2.0344,1.1915,1.8803,6.248,3.432,4.9308,3.6298,1.2597,4.8882,4.05,1.1466,3.875,0.5381,2.2598,6.5827,3.507,1.0838,4.8065,0.4621,0.808,0.0002,2.6139,1.985,2.6937,3.2648,3.9187,0.906,1.5174,1.5432,0.8109,0.0001,1.969,3.4264,0.0007,1.7718,1.8818,2.7495,0.2282,3.8509,1.6583,0.4923,0.9875,2.2783,4.3313,0.012,3.4968,3.3295,0.2619,1.9523,6.5332,3.8791,0.9544,0.6715,0.0002,3.4225,3.4964,4.3139,3.5825,2.1835,1.178,0.9478,1.5795,0.0002,2.2174,4.0933,1.7492,2.7088,2.258,4.0208,4.0492,1.5183,1.9308,1.7557,1.413,2.5702,3.6098,3.4359,3.6343,3.8549,5.6811,2.0267,4.0509,7.2239,5.2768,0.1463,0.4174,0.0002,4.5644,1.4452,3.4408,2.1527,1.3571,2.7833,0.3159,4.4634,4.5729,0.4953,0.4806,4.2785,3.5584,1.2834,3.5917,0.6216,2.8318,1.6491,5.0108,6.6581,5.761,0.7096,3.1369,2.2938,2.8272,3.737,1.7505,2.3814,0.0742,4.7776,0.6596,6.0675,1.8394,4.5116,1.5007,2.6608,1.1252,5.214,2.5721,6.2492,2.1613,4.1866,1.3942,2.0458,5.9672,0.7415,3.0676,0.7695,4.1268,4.3894,2.5422,2.8091,0.1902,0.2779,0.0002,3.6995,3.7256,2.678,4.0794,2.2899,2.0965,0.3141,0.665,0.8428,0.0001,2.8874,2.9944,3.4288,2.1595,1.2935,1.4527,2.6889,0.344,5.2272,2.684,2.3607,0.7886,5.8845,1.5573,4.18,2.1559,2.1903,0.823,1.7025,3.6281,1.5677,3.1927,5.1932,0.0082,2.5332,5.6633,2.6733,1.7506,0.9047,3.6244,0.5073,5.4212,1.3509,0.5779,0.0002,1.3628,3.0796,3.4548,0.9909,2.4224,4.1579,2.6395,4.5723,1.9905,0.5991,0.1359,5.7621,2.0731,1.1612,4.9153,4.8434,3.5428,3.7633,5.04,2.3072,1.434,4.727,4.923,0.6333,0.4232,0.0002,3.3633,0.8067,3.3577,1.3291,2.7472,0.514,6.1573,1.9046,2.3521,1.1731,1.933,1.1233,1.386,1.3585,0.9047,2.25,0.3089,3.9729,0.0216,2.5919,4.5801,1.2772,1.5792]}

There will (and will still hopefully) be some glitches that do occasionally happen. Sometimes, there are the game crashes and other errors, especially those that I got the hang of over a year ago. If this is the game that is causing your problems, ask me, and I will come out with a fix!\u00a0 And when you get to that point, give it a try. The more bugs you can ignore, the easier it will be to fix. I know my little girl loves it!\nAlso, if anyone has any ideas how this game is played, just say so.\nIf you want to see the video for this guide ( I found it at the bottom of the video where this is said). If you want to see me discuss it more, leave a comment using the dropdown under your game, or email me on my profile. Don't forget the forum thread you did post the link to on your play.\nDo you want to share this video on Facebook.

I know what a loss it is to be a child on our military-industrial complex. But I am sure you can give your children your best shot at a new life. One day it may not be there, however you die, and one day it will be.\n\nCNN takes its decision lightly. It is based on a report of a small group of North Korea watchers who said they were not aware of the threats against CNN from North Korea. No information is publicly available about the North Korean nuclear program. When asked by CNN which news organizations covering the war in North Korea were responsible for the decision to put their reporters there, the two media organizations refused to provide names of the North Koreans identified as sources. The two media sources were not involved in the CNN story. They did not respond to CNN's questions about the CNN news staff and its responsibility for keeping the North Korean story from going out, and did not respond to questions about why CNN would not answer questions about this story.\n\nCNN and CNN America, a joint venture of two companies founded in 1998, have partnered on this story, where CNN's editorial staff covers CNN's coverage of North Korea for 24 hours a day over a three-month period.\n\nI am so grateful for the opportunity to serve my people, my family, my community. I am so grateful that CNN, which was founded in 2001 to promote freedom and the rule of law in South Korea, and CNN America, which was founded in 2002 to promote democracy, was able to get my life back on track. CNN has always been an honorable organization that I will never forget. Thank you, the world.","token_len":512,"entropy":[3.8828,3.2036,5.4003,0.5233,3.9162,3.4921,7.525,0.0163,1.4481,2.784,2.2584,1.448,8.5492,1.4955,3.1279,5.3999,2.7457,6.9991,3.1345,2.4117,3.2275,0.0123,0.7746,5.7071,0.1909,3.3897,4.973,4.723,4.762,1.1559,7.6129,1.1323,1.3584,0.2362,2.4772,3.4825,3.1277,3.9608,2.7526,7.0491,2.7995,0.1558,1.5214,0.3512,5.021,1.3291,4.4308,6.6632,0.8692,2.1735,2.5284,1.5448,3.8703,0.1249,1.9061,0.2445,4.824,3.0829,3.0276,1.5221,2.1073,1.9314,0.7041,3.346,5.2188,3.2267,5.3055,3.067,3.432,1.528,4.2428,2.5373,3.379,4.3959,1.6663,1.0193,3.95,3.4361,0.9737,1.4075,1.837,1.4815,4.863,0.8468,2.1836,1.5809,1.7825,0.008,6.0809,1.6504,4.7998,0.2966,6.1255,0.3767,4.4177,4.1165,4.2066,5.7687,3.9536,0.4691,5.5736,2.5441,5.5492,6.8607,1.3476,1.1964,3.6317,0.8307,4.9979,4.7689,3.7056,1.6829,0.0502,3.8956,3.7099,4.1014,4.1353,2.4501,1.055,1.5766,4.631,2.3521,2.3873,2.715,6.7277,0.2851,0.9197,2.9614,3.5699,2.1792,4.3622,5.4758,0.0549,0.1466,4.1583,6.2993,1.6777,4.31,4.8187,3.0718,1.2711,0.4368,0.5058,4.015,0.9707,6.0548,2.9637,1.4874,2.9336,0.7926,2.0094,0.4471,1.816,5.4595,0.4693,5.7718,2.0428,3.0934,2.8353,5.4556,7.3988,2.9774,1.9715,1.6314,4.4955,4.136,1.1605,3.5218,2.5125,6.6056,0.7492,2.3978,1.4847,0.3966,4.8029,1.1537,3.2551,1.2338,0.8578,2.1282,3.7964,2.3535,3.9275,5.372,1.2429,1.0848,1.344,1.7861,1.665,1.5184,3.3535,5.145,5.2469,5.3517,0.5832,0.0687,0.5961,3.6878,1.2894,1.9979,3.6395,1.5917,2.5877,5.5475,2.2265,0.5925,5.309,1.1789,1.1718,1.4559,2.3682,4.2982,0.3965,1.024,5.7646,2.0364,4.3739,2.1301,1.4646,0.3094,3.9128,1.0668,7.0006,3.1707,5.6885,1.0022,2.6247,2.8354,0.0285,0.7363,1.8803,0.3909,1.0822,2.2097,0.0018,4.8594,6.2915,3.8102,5.1929,1.7927,0.8849,2.0217,1.6288,5.0164,0.474,1.8281,3.7249,3.8399,1.4737,5.3821,0.8047,0.1227,4.0003,2.0301,1.1468,0.0019,1.3342,3.5451,1.0192,1.6829,3.5236,2.3615,0.3281,0.953,4.617,5.1043,3.9026,3.9637,0.9243,0.2109,1.1731,5.659,3.9147,2.2803,4.0149,0.1886,1.4235,1.0721,2.9666,0.9498,3.7869,1.3857,0.886,5.6165,1.5659,2.3358,1.0936,5.9833,2.7441,1.5895,6.0969,0.5039,3.973,0.9857,1.508,0.008,1.5625,2.9519,0.2904,0.787,3.1634,0.4655,4.8742,3.1491,1.5446,4.3879,0.2043,1.992,5.4683,5.1807,1.0471,3.905,0.135,2.9618,5.0805,1.551,1.4402,2.3863,2.2544,6.4765,0.8492,4.281,0.8562,2.5582,3.0341,2.3708,4.9528,2.7197,1.997,3.9315,0.1078,0.6366,3.3977,1.8,0.5713,5.3494,1.9947,0.3094,1.0857,0.059,2.1644,0.2446,1.9981,0.6875,1.0538,2.2778,4.6584,5.7363,3.3728,3.1614,4.6108,0.6313,5.3142,1.3526,2.8121,0.5041,2.2257,1.7035,3.224,2.0615,3.251,1.8845,2.4567,0.0177,0.9133,0.109,1.1914,0.2825,3.3168,0.876,2.8541,1.3481,4.4046,0.4617,0.2683,4.4865,1.1886,0.5938,0.5197,0.0002,1.9428,4.0252,1.8779,3.9215,2.6043,2.821,2.5133,0.5092,1.151,4.4925,3.1387,4.0669,1.1245,3.5677,0.62,1.5627,4.4539,1.7868,3.5624,0.7556,2.6754,5.9656,1.9616,2.3152,4.8453,1.1193,4.4144,4.68,1.5883,1.732,0.2175,1.7395,0.042,3.6491,4.1236,0.3025,0.4599,0.0113,5.4419,1.7915,2.4812,0.0594,1.9618,0.0687,0.356,1.8204,0.0002,4.8996,2.4358,4.1463,3.056,1.1302,1.2415,1.8134,0.2931,3.5788,2.7663,4.4591,2.0729,1.4318,1.3596,0.481,1.0991,3.4689,1.8544,1.291,1.6237,1.0789,1.0775,1.7321,1.6684,3.2494,2.1812,3.3564,1.4529,0.874,5.197,2.6647,3.3828,3.322,0.8709,3.2647,0.8017,0.0022,0.0019,2.0086,3.8485,0.0215,0.1782,3.3884,2.8841,0.5875,0.2124,0.3518,1.7562,0.106,0.3804,2.2051,0.2728,0.523,2.7719,1.9698,3.2597,0.6915,0.0114,3.75,4.2808,4.6302,1.2036,0.6747,0.2047,0.845,2.3643,2.1342,2.243,0.6742,2.4848,4.0163,3.1468,2.1792,2.3051,2.6053,1.7289,0.1765,0.3287,4.0728,0.021,2.1326,4.6571,4.5577,0.4851]}

Just seeing her so happy during the wedding period. She's a very, very special person.\n\nThis is a lie. You should have never heard of this woman.

And he starts to see things that no one else can.\n\n\"It was terrifying,\" said Shaver. But now that he has a vision-deficit treatment program he wants to begin, \"I want to keep seeing that in him.\"\n\nAfter seeing the change in Vision Corrective Surgery results over three decades ago \u2014 and before his first stroke \u2014 the man had trouble using his vision and hearing. He had chronic vision problems at that time, and has no vision for much longer, said Shaver. This new treatment has kept his vision up and the man can now hear better on TV and write more frequently.\n\n\"He was the first of his kind,\" said Shaver.\n\nBlurred vision is a common problem in the blind and other vision loss sufferers.\n\nThis can happen to virtually any blind person, no matter how long they have had it, says Shaver. About 75 percent of blind people who have seen things while they are blind won't even see them. And the blind person can also become very lost in their vision for hours on end.\n\nIn one of Shaver's studies, he got an opportunity to see a person in a dark room. His blind test subjects were presented with two different screens \u2014 the blind screen on the right and a light-dark one. Shaver then sent a picture of the screen on the left. The same test subjects got two different versions of the same two screens. As the visual screen changed direction, the blur would continue for a minimum of about seven seconds, when the dark screen went away. The test subjects only needed the light-dark one for only a couple seconds before the light-dark ones would disappear again. The blur disappeared at the end of the study.\n\nAccording to Shaver, the man's vision has changed.\n\n\"If someone can't see a white screen, what does it mean anyway?\" he asks. \"I never even saw it.\"\n\nOne study found that people could be almost blinded by their own vision, because of the ability to see colors.\n\n\"It's completely subjective, especially if you're blind,\" says Shaver. \"When you're blind, you're blind by your own eyes \u2014 and people do lose vision. If you had a blind person that has a vision problem now we don't expect them to die. The person doesn't want to die. They go crazy and go insane, screaming.\"","token_len":516,"entropy":[7.3022,9.3631,0.3439,10.9317,10.8677,2.208,3.1812,11.2024,3.9862,2.6182,1.3464,1.5012,5.2987,0.0007,4.4019,1.417,7.6817,1.3529,4.504,1.8908,6.6977,0.9811,3.4633,2.4366,2.2926,3.7582,0.8183,0.4269,1.3162,0.8275,0.6831,0.0006,1.4943,2.3055,2.5823,4.9895,0.9367,1.8522,5.6878,5.1704,0.8065,6.2144,3.6111,2.311,0.4161,1.8294,1.8083,3.5999,3.4642,3.6006,1.7103,2.2397,3.4621,3.3464,2.9484,0.3775,3.8913,1.2774,3.4428,0.8211,3.5764,0.3198,4.6851,2.8065,4.1199,4.9775,5.3605,0.7589,0.312,0.0002,5.2649,3.2405,2.1552,5.8696,0.7003,6.4798,5.5958,0.346,1.0062,5.5161,4.1755,3.6152,3.6419,0.8345,5.1778,2.0445,5.1743,3.1837,4.0701,3.9077,1.0036,3.7396,1.6498,3.8408,3.2439,4.5685,0.414,2.4241,3.327,2.5083,1.0827,1.7756,2.4654,6.0053,1.9211,1.3619,4.4928,4.6031,0.3116,0.8333,1.2172,4.991,4.4378,1.8621,3.1368,4.6317,0.262,2.2608,1.8607,1.4346,0.0007,0.2792,5.3947,4.0306,1.4537,2.7936,5.0193,1.73,0.7252,4.0001,1.6374,4.0813,2.2913,2.3448,1.7602,3.1776,3.0527,5.2705,5.7236,1.6852,4.8938,1.7193,4.4427,0.6522,0.3211,0.0002,1.4309,1.898,3.8631,4.9875,1.6876,4.6308,0.7702,0.2798,1.4059,0.3628,0.7335,0.0005,0.1686,1.1298,0.0002,5.8622,1.892,0.1654,1.3752,1.3752,1.9184,1.2349,0.9916,2.8202,4.2805,2.0974,4.0418,3.0028,3.3875,2.5575,0.0001,0.6824,2.3607,0.0002,4.7619,4.8917,2.2194,1.5057,5.424,1.1021,3.1544,0.3447,1.2147,5.1308,0.015,1.0119,3.0529,0.6057,0.8223,2.8221,3.4198,1.6876,2.5642,2.4017,0.0007,0.0983,5.4728,4.1977,0.2001,0.0352,2.1524,0.3044,2.4644,0.8629,3.9503,4.6933,5.0163,2.0121,1.2147,0.4417,5.9658,0.0004,3.0011,2.2552,1.6606,1.4229,3.287,3.201,4.1239,2.195,2.3748,3.0779,3.2453,3.2002,5.0764,1.5576,1.8279,1.7433,3.674,3.0273,1.8281,0.0054,0.7626,0.3063,0.0002,3.4378,3.7257,2.6432,2.302,0.0007,0.0027,2.6879,0.2885,1.1832,5.1921,3.4464,4.7028,0.1356,0.904,1.0415,3.266,2.7619,1.2025,4.4845,0.3559,1.6864,4.1107,2.6136,6.1555,2.0204,0.9895,4.6729,0.2671,3.0184,2.3665,4.4566,2.918,3.5545,4.582,2.2564,3.541,0.7028,1.0763,0.4265,2.0463,3.7108,1.3227,2.7913,2.1725,2.603,3.5092,0.0016,4.0991,5.5918,2.4826,3.103,0.4942,0.6436,1.4922,2.2222,0.7805,0.6455,1.3893,1.4937,4.1942,1.905,0.1631,3.7989,2.8885,0.1327,2.9981,0.2126,0.2414,0.474,5.4289,0.8792,0.6733,5.3531,1.3154,5.1349,3.2112,2.0573,4.8717,0.4218,0.7357,5.327,4.0969,4.3562,2.6165,1.8983,6.124,0.0724,2.6215,4.7594,0.6131,1.769,5.2085,0.6646,4.8588,0.4,4.1634,2.9684,0.3686,2.2847,2.0492,0.0819,5.3054,4.4067,4.6818,2.1746,0.8103,0.0951,2.5844,1.8276,5.2795,1.9807,2.5787,2.3095,2.5728,1.4608,2.1625,0.3896,0.1394,5.2727,1.8378,3.3316,3.0059,0.2317,2.8079,4.3238,4.187,3.8057,1.9631,0.5494,0.3772,0.7005,4.0692,0.5251,0.2012,0.0001,5.3542,0.0038,0.793,0.0006,0.1434,1.4644,4.2009,1.8258,1.2876,1.8654,3.0069,2.7592,1.8626,0.0001,0.4677,4.2851,3.5969,3.071,1.1808,0.4097,3.1717,5.0534,2.647,0.8363,3.2959,2.4561,1.329,0.3768,7.4271,0.4709,1.1299,2.0535,0.0937,0.6432,2.507,4.9126,4.2183,1.4982,2.3462,2.5333,0.0973,0.0002,4.8981,3.4438,2.0368,0.1698,1.9585,6.4181,3.0759,5.5745,3.218,1.4369,2.0645,2.153,1.0824,2.2794,3.8538,2.1016,1.472,5.2255,0.2468,0.8598,4.0061,1.2172,1.453,0.0002,1.7534,2.4008,0.6497,5.6212,5.7887,1.781,5.6307,1.8381,0.5264,0.6583,0.6043,0.4695,1.5212,0.3389,0.0006,0.0674,0.6401,4.308,0.8345,1.0658,0.479,0.2992,0.7653,1.3061,2.2695,3.3373,0.8133,0.6551,1.7175,4.0228,1.8928,4.5565,4.2185,4.6538,2.7603,2.2455,3.2112,0.6889,4.7876,1.333,2.5318,0.5664,3.2601,3.8125,1.8488,1.5929,0.6731,7.0457,7.6434,3.3207,0.0004,4.0769,1.2366,0.0357,6.2057,1.6428,3.7103,2.9745,3.7419,0.0004,3.3624,0.1875,0.619,1.2582,1.4688,5.7819,5.2815,2.2565,2.7894,2.609,2.4445,5.8605,2.3441]}

The man shows the founding fathers a series of videos explaining American history from 1790 to today. After the videos are done, Madison stands up....\n\nMadison says that in the year 1793, the United States of America was free because of the ratification of the Constitution. That was how we created the modern-day states. The United States of America could not hold on to those principles after the ratification was taken \u2014 and Madison wasn't afraid to attack any people he perceived as being on the side of freedom.\n\nHere is Madison's speech, taken directly from the New York Times, :\n\nPresident Madison has no intention of ending the American legal system; he would rather have a system where we are free, with a strong judiciary, free from the need to suppress our people....\n\nHere is the Constitution, from George Washington's State of Washington speech, taken straight after the ratification of the Constitution. Washington is a lawyer, not a politician. It reads:\n\nAll rights and privileges enjoyed by man are abridged during the Administration of this President by the Laws of the United States.\n\nThis is Constitution, from Thomas Jefferson, a former Pennsylvania senator who won the election in 1793:\n\nCongress shall make laws, and establish in such form and by so much as they shall be necessary and proper for the carrying into execution these Purposes, which shall be so designed by the Legislature, and declared by the people, that no State may deny the equal protection of law to all.\n\nIn other words, after three decades of obstruction, the United States of America can be free forever because of our constitution.\n\nBut it's just as true for the Constitution. If George Washington, a former senator who died in Washington County, Pennsylvania, ever thought the Constitution was in the national interest \u2014 he simply thought the Constitution existed! So, in fact, Washington's Supreme Court ruled in 1790 that\n\nGovernment by the people shall take its place in the affairs of this State, and with the requisite qualifications apply them to their citizens, for the government of this State is supreme over all, and not over the governments of other States.\n\nIt would be wrong of the United States of America to allow the Founding Father to continue serving as Supreme Court Justice. He can still be found upholding the Constitution, but the question is now whether he actually can be found being on the bench.","token_len":516,"entropy":[7.3022,6.7428,4.9711,2.6596,0.6891,3.6276,1.6998,6.7155,3.1663,1.6577,8.5828,5.6707,0.8429,0.6744,2.0599,1.3858,15.7239,2.5656,2.0809,8.0071,4.1866,3.6118,1.7723,10.2201,0.1889,1.1967,2.4423,0.6042,2.0529,2.4401,5.7455,2.4876,9.0823,1.7738,1.6768,5.8295,0.002,7.6108,5.9068,7.5106,1.7811,4.2311,3.6811,2.4608,0.5659,4.6783,0.3957,4.8467,2.025,4.6243,0.8422,3.1276,0.2014,8.7825,6.8847,1.3725,12.0798,1.3775,0.1884,3.2942,3.774,2.2811,4.2972,1.6617,5.0354,0.3693,3.2624,0.5695,1.5402,2.6228,0.006,2.7047,0.0202,0.975,5.2662,4.4967,1.4577,0.849,5.9008,0.1107,0.2299,1.0078,0.7842,3.5311,2.0614,4.6916,3.25,4.9089,0.7139,3.7113,5.3869,0.0112,4.4645,0.8602,2.6364,3.0257,0.0083,0.7944,0.0106,5.5601,1.0109,5.9464,3.9984,0.1807,4.2552,3.7271,4.7938,1.0691,1.1589,4.7825,4.8534,7.2877,2.4147,3.7158,5.0217,0.0006,4.8233,0.5259,6.007,4.4932,4.9113,3.2503,3.8343,0.6415,2.9519,4.1619,0.3874,2.5102,0.0102,3.1028,0.4886,0.8297,0.0002,4.9391,1.5068,2.7878,0.7797,2.4328,2.5884,4.0665,3.1707,0.1441,0.7456,5.994,0.2242,0.3632,1.4398,8.1091,0.1669,0.0001,5.8403,1.9921,3.8529,4.6279,3.0439,0.1098,5.3795,0.6749,3.1734,5.8292,0.4065,4.3154,0.962,3.7929,0.7582,3.4651,2.298,1.9397,2.5564,3.1994,2.7687,0.7873,1.8477,4.067,2.4392,3.981,1.9058,0.8143,3.4224,0.6073,1.6576,5.6725,1.2604,4.4521,2.2888,3.2511,6.4199,1.1643,0.0002,4.0783,0.4165,1.2177,3.8613,1.9701,3.3926,5.4112,0.0898,0.6242,4.3489,0.4351,3.8663,2.9308,0.9651,3.6344,5.2389,3.4199,0.762,1.0106,0.6284,0.1162,0.3851,2.06,4.3658,2.9192,2.59,4.5906,1.3448,1.5419,0.1704,1.8641,0.6053,3.9377,4.86,1.3429,0.2892,0.0002,4.8788,3.8693,1.9415,1.0042,3.6344,0.1922,2.6253,1.2783,4.3366,0.0446,0.0005,7.7496,0.3769,4.9489,0.0419,0.496,4.9759,2.5914,0.1365,2.1629,0.0955,0.0651,0.1053,0.005,1.8122,1.1006,0.0002,2.8959,0.8432,6.1277,1.9033,1.117,2.5193,0.0154,2.9272,2.9461,3.7738,4.9035,1.1457,2.2284,4.937,0.5865,1.9317,2.4566,0.9345,3.2199,2.3344,0.0694,0.0002,4.0394,0.6743,0.7069,6.561,1.4088,0.5238,1.5576,1.9904,2.1581,0.374,0.013,2.5695,3.9385,0.6593,0.0854,0.1655,1.1206,0.6067,0.01,0.7157,0.0477,0.3201,0.106,2.8578,0.2357,0.5237,3.0706,2.3506,0.005,1.2889,0.6411,0.8662,0.2855,3.589,2.1867,2.2045,0.1714,2.5127,2.0653,0.4409,4.0146,0.4322,0.0104,1.1669,0.9295,1.1983,0.5436,1.9867,1.5288,0.5692,0.1999,0.5062,0.2639,0.1184,4.9079,1.6231,2.567,2.5785,0.2163,0.0002,3.0321,1.5581,0.0053,0.0716,5.3505,6.0738,1.7776,0.2171,5.6427,0.9683,1.5107,2.9597,0.0033,0.4906,0.006,4.1935,3.0107,0.6317,4.0113,4.412,0.6022,3.0226,3.9961,0.4562,0.8702,0.0002,3.8386,3.1474,1.2384,4.2262,1.9562,2.0994,2.8938,1.3715,2.0336,2.7357,3.6009,5.9612,0.0602,3.5067,2.2458,1.9774,3.0603,2.0224,5.8449,0.3103,2.8675,2.1841,0.3667,2.1737,0.4485,6.0377,4.0268,2.4063,1.2544,0.6919,3.8692,2.7096,4.2247,0.3218,3.8478,2.4047,6.1145,2.5463,1.9071,1.5664,6.1518,4.4851,4.768,2.247,2.9536,3.2176,0.018,3.2802,2.4581,5.0025,0.0023,2.1275,1.0472,1.201,2.9935,0.2778,7.0815,0.0002,6.063,3.8444,1.4203,0.4098,2.4832,4.4247,3.3367,1.0229,0.9754,0.8104,1.8313,0.0377,3.1427,1.167,0.7107,0.6308,5.2885,1.5175,5.7775,1.2575,5.3578,2.9666,0.6116,4.3615,4.3786,1.1795,4.1145,0.6298,3.6043,0.2784,0.8252,0.2583,1.6276,4.3051,2.7388,0.4307,2.7809,0.4543,3.2883,4.6758,1.4058,3.5687,0.1284,1.6066,0.269,0.7074,0.1521,0.0003,3.8055,4.0601,0.7966,3.1022,3.4669,1.6226,2.1636,0.0026,1.003,0.0033,0.1773,3.8632,1.3452,4.3211,4.6435,0.3403,4.2964,5.0922,1.0242,3.3274,0.6998,0.7249,1.4504,2.7071,4.5666,2.5085,1.5188,4.0858,5.7124,0.5997,0.812,1.8195,1.1122,2.9267,5.3479,0.7563,5.0895,1.0139,0.9863,4.62,4.8372,1.9842,2.1929,5.8207,4.8471,0.2605,1.7752,0.7491]}

Mr. Jones was later tried for felony arson. His conviction was later overturned, but not before he and the FBI agreed he had never committed a crime. That is why the court gave him one more chance of serving his sentence: a probationary sentence.\n\nMany more arrests can be made in his favor, even if some of the charges stem from other offenses. But when Mr. Jones is incarcerated, he can often get out of prison early again.\n\nBut the charges against him have been so serious that the Department of Justice has recently stopped doing that, said Peter Gammach, a spokesman for the department.\n\nIt took about nine months after the FBI issued a report on Mr. Jones' case, based mostly on hearsay, before the department finally revealed it had gotten a tip about the man's connections to the FBI.\n\nNow, Mr. Gammach said: ''They're really trying to prove the FBI had nothing to do with this man. The fact is that they didn't know that it had been done. But we will only be making these arrests because Mr. Jones has been locked up for some 15 years.\"\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow, the Bureau is working with U.S. authorities in the South to bring him back home.\n\nHe is the first high-profile black man to be convicted of killing one of his relatives because of the racial history of the killings.\n\nMost recently, James M. Crowell, the former head of the FBI, was sentenced last summer to 10 years in prison, after he pleaded guilty to one count of trying to obtain documents about the slaying of his sister.\n\nMr. Crowell appealed the case, arguing he had lost interest in his job. When he did return to prison in December, Mr. Carter and the Justice Department charged him with one count of using obscene material to gain a favorable plea agreement over Crowell's record. Crowell pleaded guilty and, by then, had already returned to work for the Justice Department.","token_len":519,"entropy":[1.791,6.0851,3.0803,7.3635,5.5061,9.9368,9.84,0.1034,3.1743,1.5174,13.3931,14.646,4.3209,10.068,2.8574,3.8472,2.1593,4.9226,0.096,5.1784,0.3854,0.9463,1.5802,0.0007,4.1548,0.0005,4.9422,3.3938,4.9385,5.3377,1.6239,3.268,3.4918,0.5325,2.9108,0.5678,2.7887,2.1416,1.6294,5.2336,3.4486,0.7204,0.8173,5.5224,1.5445,4.4687,3.8523,3.7506,3.3962,0.3678,5.1084,1.5726,2.4017,5.5915,1.1777,5.5778,5.8057,0.5635,2.4695,1.8422,1.8912,0.001,4.6164,0.9431,5.2316,2.5567,4.2772,1.4895,1.2326,1.5822,0.0003,1.6035,4.2852,2.8976,0.0003,0.2522,5.3634,3.7478,5.0431,5.4311,2.2885,5.461,5.4102,2.3028,0.194,1.3008,6.0037,2.9222,1.0031,2.6467,1.1776,0.1157,1.4394,0.0413,4.0657,3.0843,3.6881,3.8865,0.2991,1.8067,0.8434,0.3379,3.0939,0.0003,0.4466,2.4816,4.3917,4.911,1.7076,3.6516,2.4374,1.8966,3.8486,3.2034,0.7594,1.6215,0.2064,1.8762,0.9029,3.2908,0.2607,1.7096,4.0104,2.6545,4.0695,3.6574,4.1454,1.5611,5.7032,0.6597,1.1432,0.1514,0.5183,5.2379,3.3299,2.598,1.6977,4.6731,4.7774,0.3799,4.845,1.276,1.0127,3.5039,4.0008,1.8609,0.5396,4.5023,2.7397,5.1235,1.0341,1.6864,0.5771,0.2647,0.0002,5.3667,5.9058,5.2111,5.2024,0.7137,0.3989,2.0951,4.5949,4.1856,1.4957,3.849,0.8023,4.7632,0.7794,1.3554,1.6718,4.7541,0.082,3.7996,2.91,0.5692,2.5038,4.4436,1.5535,0.0002,0.0449,2.5122,5.0797,0.4108,0.9853,2.5012,3.943,3.3943,2.7935,0.4758,1.8225,5.5532,5.2054,0.7382,0.9859,0.0002,4.1104,2.5795,5.8032,1.0333,0.2618,2.8087,1.9083,3.5414,3.649,0.3952,2.1144,4.0501,0.028,0.1797,1.2856,5.6042,4.8136,4.5945,2.9074,2.0865,3.3407,4.4627,3.9538,4.4079,5.1481,0.1625,0.9915,1.847,0.0343,0.2071,2.6212,0.4176,0.7867,0.0002,4.8093,4.2557,3.1234,4.1448,0.4216,3.0964,1.3719,3.2433,5.3215,0.9893,2.9802,1.6619,0.8629,0.0002,0.0757,0.7851,1.5796,1.6251,5.6881,4.295,0.0081,4.749,0.0015,0.8153,2.7347,0.9964,2.7854,2.2662,5.3665,2.4311,0.4013,5.5333,2.4032,2.768,1.6337,1.8615,2.1833,1.2971,5.7147,0.3778,1.2089,2.83,0.4436,0.9567,0.0002,4.5802,0.7674,1.6293,0.0002,0.5146,0.0006,0.0008,0.3199,5.8536,0.6991,4.0007,1.6085,4.9449,2.5682,0.0297,4.5801,3.2068,3.789,3.0516,3.2801,0.0788,0.0533,0.0092,1.23,2.8203,1.747,2.7892,2.9298,1.8965,1.5375,1.8453,2.1596,0.0017,2.821,2.5843,3.4348,2.012,1.4931,1.7507,2.1531,3.5887,3.3051,4.3977,6.0433,3.169,4.0968,3.3164,1.849,2.8596,5.3386,0.0007,0.0199,1.72,1.4851,5.4486,0.0868,0.855,4.0844,6.0528,0.3257,3.1965,0.4305,0.0003,3.5859,0.001,0.0005,0.0002,0.0003,0.0011,0.001,0.0001,5.9617,0.8933,2.0918,4.511,1.3927,3.3209,1.1663,5.7961,0.0012,0.0029,0.0019,3.9221,1.9252,2.4518,3.9769,2.2621,2.9144,1.8329,0.9952,3.1653,0.7896,1.1685,0.0004,3.6345,1.632,4.343,2.0336,5.9544,0.0466,0.1235,3.4517,0.6837,1.1748,0.6492,3.016,0.3773,5.006,4.9268,0.5318,0.6677,3.2243,4.4754,0.5571,2.4538,3.2325,5.8921,0.3213,1.1389,3.0714,0.4934,1.181,0.0006,6.0394,1.1801,0.0428,4.0466,3.847,0.0227,3.9567,2.1547,0.737,2.4893,2.8186,2.9327,0.005,0.2061,1.8524,1.027,0.4597,1.2089,3.1526,3.8796,0.218,3.1209,0.0684,0.2243,0.1698,3.0364,2.478,1.2621,1.6626,0.1037,0.1774,3.3356,0.2073,0.0397,5.174,0.002,5.167,4.5197,3.5153,1.1113,5.6798,0.4994,1.3141,3.7509,1.2964,0.9045,0.0007,1.5677,0.0003,0.4591,0.0025,6.3311,1.2037,3.9978,1.2011,2.2746,2.428,0.9404,4.659,5.5057,0.0705,2.2766,0.9622,1.9561,5.0956,1.1354,3.1929,1.9294,0.5064,3.3814,1.8198,3.2986,0.2674,2.7792,0.0003,7.7178,3.7996,2.7911,1.8412,0.0038,4.4186,0.1642,0.0556,3.3971,0.1443,0.1519,4.3276,6.8479,2.3104,1.5038,3.0137,2.0365,2.8931,3.4899,2.742,5.5841,6.0964,0.0023,0.1237,5.4034,0.7215,5.2684,0.0033,2.7969,0.4112,1.8048,5.1865,3.2907,1.6658,0.019,1.0339,1.9706,6.5756,0.1007,1.5877,2.1201,0.4204,1.369,0.009,0.3654]}

I am starting to have to live it. I have started to think more through the fact that I have lost my job so badly, because people now get bored with my writing. This is why we have been trying to find a way to make it better for life.\"\n\n\nWhy has it gotten so tough for you that you are feeling this way?\n\n\n\"I am struggling with depression and it can be overwhelming. It's hard to accept that it's going to take you a year to go from one point you're so happy to be writing to another point that there is little to no amount of time left to yourself or your partner. If that's not the case then why am I being so hard on you so often?\n\n\nThe most difficult part I have now is coming to terms with this. I can never get through it. I am afraid to do anything. My husband thinks he can't help but help me, he thinks I can't. My mind is blanking completely and I am running out of time. I am also running out of money, so what am I going to do with all this time I do not have to put in for another 2 years?! I am on the brink of starvation because I can't think about anything now. And I can't think about how to treat someone who, by this time, would probably be no better off than me.\"","token_len":522,"entropy":[2.571,7.3704,0.8022,10.2506,3.646,5.8321,1.8418,11.5129,3.7103,10.9464,13.6788,0.3517,3.8203,8.395,2.8111,1.7231,9.4331,3.9501,5.7489,4.7151,6.8029,0.0269,0.1928,6.3642,2.7564,1.2501,6.7663,1.7275,3.1377,0.6233,3.5142,1.8071,6.0208,2.3981,6.2976,3.61,1.5553,1.8258,5.8617,0.8298,2.7705,1.8866,0.9183,0.2412,1.9243,11.8487,7.3937,11.2264,11.2563,3.4565,4.838,4.194,3.9382,0.0513,4.8372,2.1721,1.5087,4.4974,1.3884,4.2469,2.8879,3.8432,4.6966,2.1683,2.6563,2.0497,6.2927,1.3222,3.9929,2.214,4.2594,0.2322,3.7415,0.7094,0.5975,4.1819,6.0286,0.193,1.2245,2.5723,4.1475,0.4066,3.0057,3.7964,2.6098,2.0035,1.1508,3.2751,2.8329,0.9677,2.8498,2.3053,3.3716,2.8403,2.4424,3.1175,0.3723,2.8838,1.2224,1.0045,3.1106,1.8017,2.699,2.0251,3.205,1.4384,4.0519,1.1676,1.2137,1.4689,4.1074,3.7601,1.4413,6.0831,1.0341,4.1236,5.2063,0.8428,4.8869,3.7547,5.626,0.5153,2.4333,4.1361,1.2589,5.7679,4.3678,0.0587,0.4716,1.3502,2.21,5.3759,2.0226,0.0016,4.9401,1.6907,6.0403,0.1827,0.4743,0.9827,4.2013,0.7261,3.238,1.6293,5.0698,4.3299,0.3584,0.918,0.7698,2.7398,1.9081,3.92,3.8101,1.7355,1.8881,4.2852,2.0628,3.6898,0.3186,0.7809,0.9427,2.664,3.9831,2.021,0.7838,0.9403,0.6874,5.3729,4.4961,5.86,0.7573,3.2941,6.2675,0.4554,1.6579,2.9316,0.9455,3.5671,0.8671,0.1584,1.7642,0.0608,0.6685,1.3777,1.3671,3.9324,0.2878,5.5211,6.0895,5.1195,1.5674,5.5232,3.5256,1.5095,5.5348,0.8202,3.8674,0.0284,6.3987,2.3594,3.705,0.0003,5.3629,1.9736,2.184,0.0072,1.0201,4.6363,4.5001,3.3514,0.4422,1.9086,3.7559,4.7607,5.3691,0.9875,5.218,2.0425,0.6018,2.629,0.0076,3.3784,5.1172,1.7112,2.4038,0.6072,0.2356,1.0278,0.0005,0.5819,0.8168,2.8386,1.9921,1.3326,0.22,5.1652,4.6793,2.2332,5.7817,0.7771,0.5535,1.5973,4.47,0.4371,3.5186,2.6206,4.105,2.6065,1.2598,0.6622,1.8704,4.085,0.6575,2.4809,2.8774,5.3912,2.1001,4.3737,0.0421,0.7824,2.1412,4.4738,1.3206,1.9146,4.6859,3.2368,1.8776,3.4581,4.8656,5.6307,4.7405,4.5628,1.4117,2.6833,0.8096,1.0811,4.8389,0.711,4.0265,4.8551,1.6745,3.2561,4.4799,0.2712,2.854,1.3674,1.2005,0.2612,2.4114,1.8133,1.9822,1.526,6.7842,3.0019,0.4216,0.0002,4.1767,4.0017,2.1686,4.4695,0.3421,3.9957,0.9108,0.3643,4.4357,0.198,1.8853,5.7241,3.1646,0.2912,0.6444,0.1064,0.0005,0.0359,0.9608,1.4738,4.3876,1.2526,2.6652,1.9695,3.9649,4.2413,0.777,3.3516,0.5879,1.9599,1.6441,2.1035,0.6966,4.361,1.2728,2.8898,1.2241,3.7498,0.2841,2.6776,1.9216,1.9582,3.252,0.7241,4.1597,1.206,3.5842,4.123,5.2498,2.3274,3.8513,1.5254,0.58,0.6323,4.4316,0.5633,0.5321,1.1632,2.7689,4.8902,1.2528,5.918,1.8514,0.3624,5.8146,0.0505,2.4129,1.635,1.3183,5.5064,3.0644,1.967,4.1674,1.0551,4.2809,3.6989,1.0667,1.8501,2.4705,0.2348,3.1606,4.2633,2.43,0.0025,4.056,1.2442,2.7109,0.1704,1.8073,4.2043,2.7723,0.5088,3.6028,0.0002,3.3872,3.8289,1.9634,1.0421,5.5331,0.6073,4.0295,0.1635,5.071,0.5146,0.1124,0.0193,2.8663,1.2262,0.654,3.4042,4.0887,3.1287,3.8432,2.2796,1.4152,0.6847,2.049,4.5502,1.5447,2.933,1.2087,2.0736,4.3778,3.777,5.0549,2.6221,1.6043,1.9241,3.6998,2.0819,5.4042,0.3469,1.8939,3.882,1.6054,1.409,1.4474,0.2529,2.2948,4.4494,4.2182,0.707,4.5131,3.4233,5.815,2.0251,0.7101,1.3309,5.4103,1.4165,0.0682,1.0672,0.5898,0.7171,1.2346,5.5214,2.7627,0.0888,0.0094,1.685,2.4862,2.0319,4.0331,1.9044,0.0019,0.6016,0.0062,0.2064,1.578,1.7655,1.4111,2.0904,2.5494,5.4071,0.8193,0.0963,2.0289,3.5643,1.3889,4.5382,4.6736,5.5645,1.0407,5.7379,1.3162,1.0767,5.1267,1.8062,1.8024,0.1166,3.7366,3.4107,0.7652,2.4797,0.3064,4.3392,1.8735,1.5667,4.9674,0.5921,3.8371,1.1838,2.5328,0.2486,2.4612,0.3751,2.738,1.1456,5.6106,3.5507,2.0043,6.3443,3.4508,3.0443,1.4335,1.4331,3.6582,2.6182,0.9882,5.4504,1.2603,1.0991,0.7735,0.5369,2.6294]}

He will stay a baby forever... but if that child is unable to walk or walk well, he will turn his back on you and make you pay a great deal of money to replace him.\n\n\"But he will never go away until you have brought him back.\"\n\nHe said of her husband: \"He is the strongest man ever. He is a strong man, and I hope you will see him for what he is.\" But she says, \"It is my love you love.\" She says of his wife: \"He is a very strong man and I hope you will see him for what he is.\"\n\nIn a video posted by the website www.PraiseCars, the former Labour MP said he had met her when he was an 18-year member of the Labour party, and later that day he said he left his party to go to work at the local business, but said, \"I said 'I won't go back'. It turns out my husband was also a very good salesman.\"\n\nThe clip begins with a lengthy introduction to the documentary, and then cuts off just before it opens with a question asked repeatedly by one of the campaigners, who says he believes he can save the mother of her son.\n\nThe clip ends with a similar question, asking what happens if he is found guilty of rape. The same question has been repeated time and time again at the end of the film.\n\nThe footage shows the mother of two holding a glass of water as she says the child sleeps in front of her, then holding a bottle of milk over her head. When she makes her decision, she sits on her own while a man walks in with a long-handled knife. She then says to her husband: \"We don't live in a house you cannot love; we live in a house that I can love, I love you.\" He then removes one of the children's socks, grabs it by the neck, and asks: \"Now, tell me, what do you want from me? Don't you think I would love you?\"\n\nIt is unknown how many women have been prosecuted as part of the trial.\n\n\"This is a young woman who is clearly in her late twenties who is dealing with a very difficult, very severe case,\" said Alison Doolittle QC, prosecuting.\n\n\"She has not been tried and certainly has, although this is not some unusual occurrence, not this extraordinary case.\"","token_len":522,"entropy":[3.8827,2.7333,5.3916,2.0749,6.2763,5.901,0.2771,0.9685,0.5037,1.5865,2.8613,2.4998,5.3418,0.2453,3.8906,7.2509,0.0252,3.7232,6.6122,1.1343,5.7428,3.9911,6.8723,4.4962,3.572,3.5065,5.8663,3.5273,3.2161,4.0281,1.8469,1.3697,4.8691,0.0321,2.6901,1.7908,2.7293,3.1171,0.7052,1.1719,0.5594,6.4188,3.5729,0.454,0.209,0.8592,1.2765,4.3485,0.6665,3.0782,3.6753,3.6221,0.6185,0.5301,0.2188,1.4341,5.2223,1.6795,0.7966,1.5829,0.0194,3.0907,4.3061,2.8183,1.1922,2.3394,3.501,2.3043,5.4505,1.4187,2.6647,5.4511,0.3865,1.1399,3.313,0.2989,0.0004,3.4823,1.9822,5.4166,3.0257,3.1637,0.6692,0.0928,1.45,1.8391,2.8281,5.8286,1.2474,4.8605,1.2598,0.8202,1.5708,2.1047,3.5386,0.5713,1.7536,1.9508,1.8299,3.4383,2.102,1.0762,3.1306,0.9404,3.4465,0.5214,0.0278,0.1949,1.2641,8.5241,1.9135,4.6976,3.8539,0.3353,3.4737,0.9198,3.5169,4.5414,4.1415,3.8324,2.1903,3.4536,2.0407,3.8296,1.9451,2.4077,0.3291,0.0253,1.4242,0.8387,1.8312,2.8041,1.7811,0.2681,2.39,0.9119,0.8007,0.3291,0.1354,0.3283,0.0441,0.0641,0.0367,0.0125,0.0089,0.1806,0.4488,0.0003,4.0492,1.7856,3.2826,1.5384,1.9733,1.7938,4.4293,4.3671,0.0077,6.1203,5.0754,5.272,3.7403,1.6302,2.2843,5.037,5.5867,0.9977,2.5078,2.8228,1.7228,4.0932,2.0418,2.4445,1.1661,0.1726,4.4481,2.5364,0.1192,0.0792,8.4572,0.0144,0.6285,2.1317,1.4565,2.3818,1.2439,4.8113,3.5269,0.989,1.9834,3.4184,1.0664,5.8798,2.5679,3.5207,1.9661,3.0015,0.6409,2.3929,3.0612,1.8533,3.6095,5.6774,3.173,2.3811,3.3496,3.6132,0.0656,0.6731,5.4374,2.4274,1.3287,4.1511,0.0043,1.8362,1.2093,2.528,3.244,6.5456,0.0232,3.081,2.3174,1.8268,4.3539,1.0608,3.28,2.3623,3.2016,1.7904,0.2702,0.0003,2.2009,6.0736,4.0115,0.7465,2.0785,5.6672,3.9765,1.1647,0.9286,5.029,0.9694,2.3777,1.7015,2.9871,2.1615,3.9683,0.6473,2.6005,4.3498,0.5968,1.0224,4.9764,5.8589,5.5394,1.6239,4.1011,0.3697,0.2526,5.1233,1.9667,1.733,2.6271,2.5425,3.963,2.3731,4.0662,4.7635,1.5433,4.5621,0.8316,2.6735,2.7582,1.5393,0.5171,0.0003,1.6105,2.925,1.5413,0.2652,1.2483,5.8407,0.8296,1.6257,2.4828,3.4034,3.878,0.4797,1.9848,2.1336,3.5567,1.2823,0.3451,3.8414,0.9853,2.3181,5.2968,1.6285,3.8786,0.4887,1.444,4.3972,0.0392,1.1462,0.0533,4.2179,1.1887,3.105,0.1377,0.2301,1.7904,0.9646,0.3921,0.0003,1.4868,4.3609,3.0486,1.3106,2.31,1.6383,3.6853,4.6354,1.4963,4.5683,0.3831,1.109,2.8894,0.8806,3.2639,3.7188,3.0818,5.9881,1.5883,3.8577,0.0044,0.4268,1.9258,3.452,4.6175,1.5536,2.3625,0.305,2.4598,3.8923,0.5242,0.507,0.965,4.7748,1.0962,5.716,1.8591,4.1891,0.7513,0.9213,5.5802,1.5663,2.0674,4.6223,3.8399,2.712,1.4141,2.6599,2.2649,2.7017,0.4791,5.0938,3.1747,0.5396,1.439,0.7909,3.1173,1.6663,2.1953,2.4078,3.6165,0.7034,0.4082,0.0177,3.7903,3.3093,0.0007,5.7612,0.8364,0.9961,2.7324,4.5547,3.2421,3.6824,5.1832,0.6805,0.3314,0.2565,0.2284,0.89,1.5593,4.3402,1.816,0.7845,2.4754,3.7643,1.8125,0.5216,1.3215,3.6155,1.421,5.1568,4.2235,0.2972,0.4762,3.2825,0.2859,5.1633,1.7768,5.2047,1.545,3.6574,0.1554,2.8411,1.2505,0.6424,4.693,1.9859,0.0091,5.1559,1.4884,5.0711,0.2542,1.9239,1.7319,1.8011,0.0943,0.9938,2.5739,0.1341,2.4995,5.0521,0.0011,0.4085,2.6429,0.7277,3.009,1.9878,1.0703,1.435,0.404,0.0002,3.9998,0.5826,5.2963,1.7283,1.1673,2.1205,0.9723,1.2193,4.1555,3.9886,2.785,0.0008,0.3532,4.0496,1.2002,1.1948,0.0003,4.8143,3.1411,0.5241,1.4267,5.0768,1.1783,0.8819,1.7185,5.6513,2.7782,1.896,2.0161,1.8266,3.3283,1.3931,5.1504,0.0242,1.1687,1.414,1.0193,3.6722,1.4678,5.2341,1.7947,1.242,0.7697,5.5194,5.098,5.2003,0.4696,3.1114,0.2496,1.632,0.4126,0.8982,0.0003,0.8478,1.2428,1.6272,3.3241,0.9746,4.8944,3.4565,5.2906,2.6893,7.7916,4.2106,3.2866,0.8375,1.8036,5.673,4.8997,4.1967,0.8466,3.1508,4.9917,4.904,0.9924,2.1461]}

The problem is with so many journalists that can't understand the concept and I think that there's a lot more to it but I'm trying to give myself what I want for one or two more years.\n\nNatalie: Your article in the New Yorker suggested that the average Internet use is around 18% for people who really want some quality content and that you can get some very good content there. Do you believe you have taken a step forward, or some of the other things I'm getting good at, in publishing in this age of digital and mobile technology.\n\nNatalie: I like that you are changing your opinion from your own perspective very quickly. I know you've always been one of the most consistent critics, which is a refreshing experience because people now may think I'm a huge Internet geek, so there are a lot of things I need to fix. I think there is always a chance that something happens because people see that the internet is full of people who really want some content, and like I will say, if you understand what I'm trying to say you get the message then you can really go a long way on that and build a better story.\n\nNatalie: One of the things that you'll need to understand is I am a bit of a tech dev. If you are a young person growing up in the '90s maybe you will not remember what you did back in those days and if you can remember when you are going through some really traumatic events that will tell you things about your life that you didn't want to admit.\n\nNatalie: I think that you did very well and I think you are doing great again and I wish you a very happy Internet.\n\nNatalie: If you continue your blog and your personal life for another 2 years I encourage you on the ways we move forward with the internet and what we can do to take it to the next level.\n\nN,N,I,I,I\n\nThank you to Natalie, Natalie and all the contributors for their great encouragement.","token_len":522,"entropy":[11.5031,6.7244,5.033,1.8124,1.5749,4.5363,5.4773,1.8978,2.2552,2.5816,1.4949,0.8066,6.1802,1.4538,0.6326,0.0033,4.6123,5.2277,1.6931,3.9703,5.5895,3.1683,0.1944,4.6049,0.4064,2.4576,3.697,0.002,0.9354,3.651,5.7072,4.2433,3.435,5.8767,1.4093,5.9542,3.7903,1.1257,5.7228,4.1679,5.2754,4.8309,4.5257,0.9638,5.2041,0.6684,2.6176,0.0001,2.0873,0.0946,0.2408,1.2363,2.5788,3.9006,0.3622,0.0563,1.2652,4.7534,1.9399,0.9106,3.7873,1.045,1.4573,4.9812,0.2984,5.1066,2.8038,1.6039,2.9133,5.1129,0.4688,4.8163,1.1712,4.3225,3.4361,2.6441,2.0246,3.347,2.8624,4.6332,3.2406,4.7777,0.5451,0.7866,0.0001,0.5392,0.0109,0.024,1.1961,1.5067,3.4078,2.1078,3.5564,3.1822,2.742,3.87,0.9687,1.8815,1.054,4.1491,0.034,2.166,1.1962,2.0261,3.6768,2.5417,0.3993,4.093,5.1613,0.3114,4.7552,2.6418,4.071,0.6298,3.6271,1.6092,4.271,3.0351,3.7607,1.2727,1.5231,3.3564,2.2218,0.8324,1.4134,2.4307,1.4098,1.0323,4.5923,0.9954,1.7813,2.5922,0.0783,3.4125,3.763,5.6761,0.2706,2.016,4.1956,5.3673,4.1414,0.273,2.6426,0.3898,0.8837,0.4573,0.0001,0.4322,0.0133,0.0204,5.8202,4.7822,3.7072,1.5953,2.3535,1.5514,5.387,0.514,2.2513,5.8825,5.7216,6.1185,1.1199,2.9362,5.0473,2.3052,2.8373,3.0899,0.9685,5.8303,1.7069,6.1139,4.664,1.0366,2.3966,2.5315,2.2576,3.2777,2.971,3.577,3.9842,1.4521,1.3522,4.3692,0.778,2.6964,0.0555,3.5426,3.2316,1.7277,6.0541,2.2232,1.0596,1.4692,3.6677,1.6057,6.4276,2.6071,0.4192,3.23,2.0922,3.5705,2.1068,4.8084,5.6542,0.3575,2.7733,1.8204,5.5307,4.0519,3.0656,3.8605,0.6517,3.42,2.544,2.8136,4.0029,3.8617,0.5166,0.0002,0.1171,0.0039,0.0013,0.8329,5.3167,2.7443,2.9702,2.5986,5.7309,2.802,5.5164,4.6459,4.2817,2.0482,1.9642,7.1736,1.1608,0.6277,1.192,3.4194,1.7213,2.2239,3.4981,0.9904,4.1024,0.2061,0.2685,1.7052,4.8373,2.8819,2.9715,4.156,0.8969,2.3557,5.7295,4.1768,3.127,4.6652,5.7509,5.7812,2.2382,2.3157,0.398,2.0582,5.648,5.3884,4.4589,1.9138,4.6749,3.8817,1.7985,1.7245,0.1283,0.0527,1.7605,0.8296,4.5852,0.0472,4.5228,0.8127,1.7886,1.9273,2.4607,1.6,3.9481,1.3356,2.8446,0.9082,2.5499,5.1762,4.9467,2.8913,4.7054,2.503,3.646,2.5805,0.6492,4.5823,0.0504,2.8423,0.523,3.1011,0.7325,2.0166,2.5138,1.8061,1.4796,6.0855,1.1278,7.9047,0.9452,0.8971,3.4008,1.1433,5.937,1.8602,0.9403,0.6464,2.7652,0.0086,0.2703,2.7603,4.3111,2.0303,2.0717,6.608,0.8278,1.5928,3.7253,4.1706,3.2616,0.4134,0.0352,4.5401,1.9284,3.2619,5.6403,1.5733,1.7269,3.8624,0.5042,0.3792,0.0001,0.5823,0.0046,0.0061,4.4718,0.5529,0.1727,0.5542,1.0822,2.5182,5.0942,2.4012,0.2979,4.5333,1.1269,4.7727,2.6566,1.8172,4.6159,0.4946,0.2467,4.1566,5.826,1.5617,4.2217,0.7812,2.4997,1.6797,4.6393,1.202,5.2714,0.0128,1.2281,1.1107,2.2572,0.7543,0.0635,5.3358,0.6254,4.5129,2.724,4.4928,3.3624,1.7474,1.6647,3.5914,2.342,2.6999,0.112,2.6004,3.39,0.1872,4.1703,2.359,5.2022,0.6442,4.4731,4.5784,0.8803,2.7654,3.5976,5.0152,2.3223,2.9799,2.9381,4.6337,0.1115,3.7938,1.4279,1.4269,0.4735,1.6727,0.9025,2.4241,0.0005,3.3284,0.0381,5.2105,1.715,1.1968,0.0002,0.639,0.0039,0.0024,0.9685,1.6618,1.8259,3.3087,5.7803,4.7036,0.1135,3.2436,1.0582,1.0079,1.5081,2.3013,2.7721,2.9941,5.3321,2.1825,0.781,4.8246,0.255,2.6779,0.9999,0.4255,5.5084,1.4311,0.6134,0.0002,0.3275,0.0141,0.0138,3.7839,0.516,5.5919,4.1783,4.5013,1.8218,3.2713,5.0035,0.8974,5.0009,3.3835,4.6632,1.127,1.9991,6.1023,0.118,6.4834,3.4788,5.9511,4.7053,5.565,0.333,2.7302,2.0767,2.3731,1.1554,3.0281,1.1617,0.5704,0.4483,0.6397,5.1238,1.4559,1.4881,0.6197,0.0159,0.028,0.4062,0.8267,0.0002,0.7007,9.8686,3.8554,1.4119,3.933,0.9167,1.7758,0.7983,0.4364,2.1876,0.0002,5.6905,0.0466,3.0347,2.5961,2.365,1.0319,2.2963,3.2519,0.821,4.6697,1.1911,1.5806,4.3614,6.1334,1.0162]}

But it's hard to imagine some sort of revolution that never happened.\n\nI can believe Steve Jobs was not the only person who had a personal crush on his friends from high school... or that the Internet is about to become really good for science. I can assure you that the Internet has made the average American so much nicer (and less unhappy) than anyone else in the developed world. And some research has revealed that most Americans can now watch people from different races, religions and religious traditions engage in free-roaming online conversation and engage in political discussion on the basis of the same content (the Internet has given people a more free reign to share their personal details that they wouldn't have done otherwise). In fact, most Americans now use their smartphones very freely, using it to surf the planet. The Internet is now becoming a real and effective platform for mass interactions between individuals, cultures and communities. It has been a very long ways off from becoming a reality. The most critical part of any successful change -- from Facebook to Android to iOS -- will always be a conversation over how to make it work.\n\nI am so grateful for the Internet, and I am still so thankful for the fact that I did have something to teach, because not even the Internet has kept us from the horrible things happening in the past. In any event, I am pleased that there has been something very simple and simple about my life. The fact that millions of people all over the world now share information and ideas that are being shared has now saved me from the dark past I thought I would never be able to forget. As a community, we must continue working to protect our humanity, to fight for this nation to be strong again and to become a great nation once again.","token_len":522,"entropy":[6.3384,5.646,4.7146,8.5696,2.8341,1.9835,2.7962,6.4513,7.9174,1.7509,4.8575,1.2715,6.8908,0.8916,5.3885,5.1388,3.6116,3.9441,0.0183,5.88,3.1088,5.7147,0.7738,1.3786,5.2453,0.1277,1.4794,3.4866,5.4406,2.2799,5.6138,4.673,4.0071,1.8737,0.4966,5.0553,4.4503,4.2112,3.5463,5.5442,5.1151,3.5208,1.0424,3.4325,0.0024,3.3819,6.6319,2.9479,2.6508,4.8601,1.1631,2.5895,0.1639,3.6073,3.7559,5.3011,0.9441,1.5871,0.0485,4.1765,5.6033,6.0052,4.9862,4.8554,1.0972,0.8098,3.2707,2.8952,0.0009,4.8796,3.6192,5.9376,5.0807,1.3555,3.2281,5.2671,1.3662,3.4844,1.2444,3.2833,5.84,4.5695,0.9846,6.9405,5.4048,2.8724,2.7496,1.0053,5.0693,5.6357,4.2451,0.9776,2.3833,4.4723,4.1635,2.829,2.7757,4.2543,3.6444,5.2172,2.0643,3.3276,1.4336,4.3239,3.3902,4.6986,1.7505,0.0006,3.8058,2.9012,0.9653,3.535,1.1348,2.6949,0.1271,2.9028,1.0101,3.5402,4.4912,0.0007,2.7093,1.3235,3.9664,3.3586,5.1065,0.5262,2.7085,4.1914,2.5978,1.5031,6.3386,5.9618,5.5145,3.1194,5.8613,5.054,4.7148,6.5094,0.3508,0.4205,2.8026,5.557,1.6378,3.0473,1.592,1.457,0.789,4.9434,1.7672,5.0032,0.6101,0.3707,4.0366,1.4971,3.9803,3.5862,1.0177,0.1826,0.7879,5.6829,0.8771,3.7994,2.1331,0.0011,5.7636,5.5607,1.889,2.4926,2.2265,0.9561,2.101,0.293,1.6056,5.6287,2.7342,0.0009,3.567,1.7942,5.0432,0.931,0.6261,1.008,0.0003,2.7102,3.3835,5.1274,4.5073,0.2369,1.9263,3.7106,2.2682,1.0775,1.9692,0.593,3.4686,1.8331,5.054,4.1855,0.0149,2.0224,4.5191,3.7934,0.0846,0.0045,2.7953,3.7309,2.4606,3.5248,4.6811,3.0059,4.6193,0.2249,1.9088,5.734,3.7987,1.3152,3.5485,0.7469,1.9661,1.3088,6.2155,0.0654,0.5168,2.5983,1.2216,1.8508,3.1539,3.0355,6.0684,2.3402,4.1645,0.6606,5.3392,4.7537,1.2451,2.8376,5.2564,0.3311,1.5705,3.5623,1.0493,1.4011,1.161,4.799,0.0094,0.4366,2.5995,5.7399,6.6995,1.7121,4.1237,0.3295,4.5546,1.985,4.6343,3.1947,4.4438,5.064,2.1246,3.6921,3.745,1.5763,1.9105,1.3621,5.4554,1.9666,5.5704,0.0777,5.5024,1.4359,4.3997,0.0769,3.672,3.9751,2.7571,2.9896,0.1204,5.3674,2.9429,2.9453,1.514,4.9792,0.0685,2.9586,3.668,3.9002,3.695,3.9016,1.9943,2.3969,4.057,3.1261,2.084,3.6711,3.2258,4.3029,0.8041,4.299,1.1848,3.2537,5.4047,5.4906,1.4927,3.3243,0.0007,1.2016,4.914,1.2061,0.3187,4.045,1.2293,0.0234,4.3364,1.04,2.3121,3.3801,3.0829,1.7781,6.2531,3.278,1.5242,4.8414,2.0366,1.0193,4.9242,0.3316,7.7437,2.2558,3.2556,1.3924,1.325,2.9768,4.526,1.3133,3.8794,3.5922,5.4261,4.0839,0.2926,5.6781,6.0857,1.8807,3.6458,1.5624,3.8362,0.3808,2.831,0.6151,2.5035,2.4693,3.2223,1.8946,3.5387,3.2536,7.9252,3.1316,1.3701,3.437,0.9563,2.6868,0.9573,3.7509,5.0022,5.2434,3.1021,0.4523,4.2591,3.8869,3.2235,3.482,5.1022,6.2435,0.3356,5.349,0.4989,4.4279,0.6903,2.1109,3.692,0.1053,3.7511,5.2915,4.6816,3.5282,0.8659,2.2978,1.7996,2.5683,0.7473,0.9194,0.0002,2.3749,3.0735,3.267,2.7299,1.2595,1.2398,2.1578,2.2076,1.1696,1.4529,1.6846,5.1087,1.6117,1.794,0.6223,1.0466,3.1324,0.0347,1.5766,4.8006,4.7237,4.9437,0.763,3.6871,4.9865,3.6415,5.3854,4.0296,2.0036,2.2824,1.973,5.6522,3.2495,0.8843,3.199,5.3734,1.8547,4.1501,1.2202,1.3519,1.2877,0.7559,3.7645,4.9668,1.572,0.0542,1.1477,1.9596,5.1524,0.9183,3.9466,2.9237,0.2085,4.3325,4.9084,5.0719,1.3531,1.8958,1.2568,3.7714,1.8149,1.3851,3.2871,3.0797,0.1946,6.8015,0.1577,0.6523,5.0339,0.3846,0.0248,0.099,2.2992,3.3985,2.9386,2.2352,2.1644,1.6793,1.6548,5.2706,1.2302,5.944,5.9431,4.808,1.0143,1.0892,1.4606,5.7068,3.3246,2.6743,4.4571,0.8718,1.4184,0.3001,2.7839,0.4,0.0007,3.5946,0.1727,4.6295,1.5035,5.7729,0.5254,0.5813,3.1646,2.9206,5.0428,1.2528,4.6727,1.7189,4.3585,1.8824,2.0023,4.751,1.1558,5.7268,5.7166,2.8698,1.5552,4.4854,0.9411,2.3933,1.1115,4.1273,0.8462,2.0167,1.4243,4.7455,0.3804,0.1403]}

However, he disappoints his constituency when he doesn't deliver the mass insanity and chaos that he promised.\n\nNecromancer in the World\n\nNecromancer can be found in his own reality as a sorcerer. Necromancers are able to make the mind-crazed undead into a monstrous creatures and can do wonders with those.\n\nHe was once called a 'Ned and is the strongest wizard ever' in the Wizarding World, and still does so. However, it is revealed he is the new ruler of the undead. The undead are so powerful that necromancers are the only way he can take them down. It has since turned the undead into a puppet race, complete with his own armies, and his minions. Necromancers are also able to control the undead with the use of some magic.\n\nThis trope can also be found in some other worlds and races.\n\nIn Star Wars, there is a Necromancer in the Black Star who controls the souls of his followers while he creates a new age. Also, Necromancers also become immortal when they give out powers to some magical beings, like the Sith.\n\nTabletop Games\n\nWarhammer 40,000 has the Necromancer in the Warhammer 40,000 setting which is set in the Warhammer 40,000 system.\n\nThe Necromancer in Fate\/Stay Night has this in the campaign.\n\nMass Effect's the same at its core in both versions, though that isn't clear, due to the plot being somewhat unoriginal. In the previous game, the Necromancer in the Mass Effect universe is described as having been \"a 'Dark Necromancer' who created a universe in which they could control the spirits of his people while they were still in their very infancy.\"\n\nIn Warhammer 40,000: Apocalypse, the Necromancer in The Night Lords gives out the powers of an army of undead to Chaos Space Marines. The Space Marine army is then sent to wreak havoc on the Citadel, and is eventually defeated by the Necromancers in the end; at some point, he will use Necrolithic energy to resurrect some of his old comrades and stop them from growing. The Necrokinester, the Necromancer in The Night Lords The Chaos Space Marines in Warhammer 40,000 have also had a similar problem in The Space Marines, with the Space Marines having their armies spread to many sectors of the star system.\n\nVideo Games\n\nWebcomics\n\nWeb Original\n\nWestern Animation","token_len":524,"entropy":[7.372,1.1929,10.2059,0.0509,2.4565,3.9767,1.9383,0.6389,1.0665,0.8477,4.6173,0.1743,1.6901,11.441,0.0626,1.7695,12.6758,3.6365,0.4971,4.3546,0.001,5.3275,2.2205,7.8977,7.5177,3.2945,4.0936,1.2954,1.5426,1.5965,1.0923,1.9556,0.0137,5.1777,2.95,1.8993,5.4215,1.7262,5.3468,1.3504,0.0002,2.0449,0.0226,0.2875,5.0109,1.2654,1.0202,0.6845,5.2012,4.1434,5.9443,2.9623,1.2496,5.0545,1.5736,3.3825,0.7193,0.0623,1.3061,4.3836,0.0068,4.2537,3.1576,5.6815,2.8868,5.6144,3.4941,0.0368,4.3532,2.687,2.9871,5.3836,5.8869,2.6159,2.5368,3.9339,5.44,2.5862,5.1502,3.9939,2.0274,0.0002,4.3962,3.3997,2.3372,3.9307,1.4884,3.573,4.7392,6.0322,6.0866,5.165,3.0867,4.8931,4.9967,3.1602,2.4225,2.8453,1.1604,2.7133,0.3969,0.1381,1.9832,2.1265,5.1791,2.0673,2.5252,1.2316,3.1821,0.1498,3.8211,1.2517,2.6441,2.7429,1.1002,2.8428,5.2249,3.9426,0.0784,0.8297,3.7838,1.3777,3.4157,2.8337,1.4844,4.2043,1.5229,0.4296,2.8761,0.0988,0.0949,1.8535,4.6634,0.9839,1.458,4.394,0.3,3.9528,1.941,1.0056,0.3064,4.6229,3.8902,5.8626,4.5125,2.8874,1.1382,0.4194,1.849,5.7074,3.1233,1.8873,5.0736,0.0476,3.9609,1.2712,4.2539,1.8824,2.0923,3.0123,3.0682,0.6669,1.5538,0.2301,0.0119,1.285,2.4242,1.8375,0.0051,3.2046,1.1529,2.5876,2.8579,2.3489,2.7217,0.0013,5.6868,3.1695,0.9236,0.7119,0.0001,4.524,5.1364,4.007,1.1098,0.2535,2.8218,0.2503,4.0082,2.2874,3.3755,2.9747,4.3152,0.8975,1.0332,0.0002,1.9598,4.2218,0.618,1.9542,3.9414,0.8383,0.4478,1.725,0.0837,1.6921,0.7662,5.8909,4.1821,2.1745,5.0037,0.7717,5.6326,0.0851,2.66,2.3809,4.8435,2.095,4.7586,1.6259,1.8072,4.8975,1.7402,5.7572,0.5839,2.956,0.1397,0.0135,4.6392,4.6433,4.3832,2.2156,0.9559,5.3523,4.2707,4.795,1.395,5.1204,6.3371,0.8343,2.1194,2.2465,1.0947,3.8646,1.6449,0.5344,0.0002,4.3881,0.0148,0.0465,0.0383,0.0002,2.7223,0.2617,0.1029,0.0762,0.0011,2.3462,2.8338,0.3129,0.1148,1.1549,0.7107,3.1436,0.2263,0.1744,0.0008,4.4729,5.2793,1.1863,4.9708,0.8561,0.7161,1.9291,0.3946,0.0744,0.0027,5.4904,0.4928,1.2791,0.0004,1.8943,1.3069,0.1552,1.093,5.5491,1.0774,2.448,0.0076,1.6231,3.8298,1.1817,1.1545,5.213,2.3035,0.9013,0.0004,4.7648,0.2728,4.6462,5.7535,4.861,6.2552,3.6567,1.578,4.0902,4.6208,5.2426,1.5452,2.5591,4.9746,4.658,0.0006,4.5681,2.9056,3.8381,0.036,1.0092,5.9469,1.4357,4.8436,4.9865,2.7304,0.5824,2.7764,1.034,5.3329,1.8521,0.4517,1.0444,0.3814,0.0758,3.0354,0.8734,2.9277,0.0004,0.9863,1.7818,4.4901,0.2265,2.1028,3.3168,2.8271,2.6801,5.4484,5.2372,1.7727,0.024,0.7529,1.2046,4.4323,1.5426,5.0431,2.4958,0.1656,4.5705,2.0148,2.1468,1.1615,4.2533,0.1696,4.0604,2.2822,4.8032,1.9004,1.2473,2.0485,2.755,1.5684,5.5048,3.3046,1.1034,1.1854,0.0003,1.9564,2.5339,0.3679,0.0738,0.0097,2.0877,4.7546,0.2777,0.8214,0.3399,0.0714,1.2458,3.8269,5.3798,4.7421,6.0412,2.2317,2.3333,2.1399,0.3055,4.434,2.9807,0.8146,2.1333,1.7274,5.4827,1.8914,0.0354,1.1362,2.2201,5.3229,1.8171,2.1452,1.3229,4.1912,2.4983,0.6064,5.736,0.0047,0.1383,0.5347,0.581,5.4917,1.7351,2.0055,3.1163,2.0359,1.5402,1.202,0.7824,1.3579,1.6025,0.0204,2.7875,1.0396,2.1176,5.302,5.1359,3.0547,0.01,0.9579,3.5202,4.4909,4.1717,4.7606,5.8186,1.7289,2.4829,4.6999,0.3154,3.6065,4.009,0.274,0.8934,3.9738,3.5215,2.1162,5.6227,1.306,0.3951,5.567,3.2142,2.6247,0.4039,4.3641,4.3323,1.8374,6.4339,2.6477,2.6246,0.4896,0.3582,0.8092,2.1443,2.2767,0.1679,6.7554,5.4574,1.0654,0.2258,3.777,0.8577,0.2052,0.0106,0.0006,2.8938,4.8305,3.4393,2.2856,2.4102,5.3484,2.4252,2.2004,5.3966,0.4864,1.9327,2.4236,0.9986,3.2824,0.3852,2.3902,3.6599,3.7827,5.8461,3.2467,3.2261,4.1248,1.1738,0.4012,6.6659,0.2132,1.063,0.6126,0.0003,2.0073,0.0025,0.0201,0.0003,0.2761,1.255,0.0068,0.0832,0.0003,0.5665,0.0308,0.1008,0.0003,0.5361,0.0026]}

The overall rate of child poverty, which includes children of unmarried parents, is just 1.6 per cent, below the 4.1 per cent that has seen its peak in 1975.\n\nIn the developing world, poverty is more than twice as high in developed countries and nearly 10,000 children are living in urban areas, where family-based programs that reduce the impact of poverty on their daily lives often cost millions.","token_len":524,"entropy":[10.6257,1.6315,6.989,0.6641,0.6683,10.8562,2.7394,3.527,10.6554,6.3363,4.3189,1.3629,3.2807,4.0516,7.6368,2.8068,11.0371,5.1136,6.0237,4.58,0.6507,5.5728,3.0973,0.9418,4.2508,1.3468,2.7914,4.7076,5.5357,5.1017,0.2941,3.8651,1.0526,3.7976,2.2497,4.4018,1.9665,5.1294,1.7332,2.0806,0.2384,0.8206,2.0589,0.037,4.0026,6.3488,3.011,3.6115,1.655,2.7394,5.6381,2.6405,3.4577,3.3576,3.6193,0.4982,0.6668,0.5876,3.3821,1.8209,2.5335,0.3451,4.7357,5.8771,0.7265,0.8193,2.3615,2.4516,0.9149,0.0183,1.5113,0.331,3.0663,4.8373,2.8191,1.9509,2.2457,4.3899,1.2572,3.4463,4.6135,0.442,0.7013,5.4508,5.7262,3.4289,0.5086,0.7328,0.7289,2.0897,0.0005,3.2922,2.1811,4.0579,5.2899,4.7908,2.5068,1.6467,0.8249,1.1958,4.252,2.461,0.5587,4.6471,2.9663,0.4976,5.0221,1.419,3.3455,0.6906,2.5129,0.2585,0.0004,3.8102,1.516,5.6306,0.266,2.137,5.3036,5.375,4.0455,0.6295,1.5563,3.0434,0.1453,3.077,1.7648,5.4159,2.7092,3.4235,3.1545,3.475,4.008,0.8889,3.6895,1.7433,1.7479,5.815,0.0764,0.6472,4.3142,0.0125,1.3492,4.7613,3.1993,2.8836,5.3903,0.5804,0.0398,0.5896,3.0286,0.7212,1.9596,3.1533,4.4378,1.8814,1.0888,5.5346,1.346,0.2222,1.0069,0.6898,0.0003,4.5784,5.3742,0.9269,4.246,2.0292,2.7519,1.1533,3.1628,4.0264,0.799,2.4181,4.8211,1.4127,1.4703,2.3033,5.2963,5.9015,0.371,1.5336,2.2594,1.2724,5.4975,0.7555,3.9801,0.0025,0.0459,0.0183,2.1726,2.1081,1.71,3.5066,0.4227,0.7037,0.0003,0.4856,2.1241,4.8665,1.1236,2.4628,0.0423,0.8705,1.3135,0.6051,0.2605,1.5896,3.2651,0.2501,1.6643,2.7198,3.4005,4.8913,0.6276,5.1529,2.5197,2.8953,1.4515,3.7359,0.3936,0.6137,1.3433,0.9697,1.1236,2.3846,6.1151,0.8683,1.6717,0.4048,2.1546,2.5498,0.2698,0.6629,0.0003,2.8465,1.1453,3.663,2.1782,0.3169,2.6184,4.6159,3.3325,5.6748,2.9543,1.7349,5.0307,2.8237,4.0462,1.5992,2.7485,1.2827,2.9714,1.8041,0.7216,2.9535,0.4858,2.398,4.6915,2.601,2.4624,0.6135,0.4924,0.0003,5.7051,3.6003,0.7729,1.2741,2.0421,6.3381,2.8622,4.7244,0.7893,6.7338,0.6403,4.1876,3.4309,5.4537,0.0457,2.9602,3.8573,1.7721,1.6877,2.5965,2.1671,1.1326,2.2841,0.0368,2.0278,4.6521,0.113,0.1868,0.681,0.2511,0.0004,3.1365,3.6015,2.213,5.1222,5.7209,4.2965,3.0815,1.3873,0.5955,0.0001,0.566,4.514,2.9596,4.9268,5.641,4.1536,0.9917,4.6923,1.5084,3.8394,0.3747,3.5133,5.2402,4.2278,0.4045,0.2864,0.006,0.3476,4.7676,6.8634,1.1314,0.34,1.8039,1.4421,0.2051,0.1092,0.7909,0.0004,4.5048,1.9498,2.866,2.7413,4.3786,4.7362,1.8094,5.2505,5.233,1.3693,3.2617,2.6357,3.3538,0.0074,3.7532,1.2263,0.6422,3.1538,1.8373,4.0344,0.7712,4.3843,0.8559,3.4337,0.3774,2.1149,2.7994,5.6648,3.1281,3.021,4.7457,4.3672,0.2217,5.4714,2.6997,0.7073,0.2535,0.0003,2.6871,4.9311,0.547,5.3204,3.3324,6.7232,1.2624,0.1789,0.5824,0.5554,4.407,5.8402,0.5721,0.2842,1.6753,1.0419,0.549,0.2033,6.7792,2.2586,4.0271,2.5274,0.414,4.8773,0.3654,2.4089,0.7426,3.4809,0.1094,0.0016,0.6764,2.9517,2.8322,0.0226,1.8287,5.5184,2.6612,5.7774,1.4585,1.3903,3.4013,0.0393,2.7003,3.4935,3.6362,2.1672,0.5362,1.6377,1.4811,4.5209,0.1069,1.1508,0.4346,0.0004,5.157,1.151,3.4604,0.0766,0.3156,3.1776,3.1783,0.571,2.0433,0.1888,1.1981,3.4523,1.732,2.9676,5.3401,2.3058,1.0423,0.6321,0.0628,3.6034,1.3106,2.5666,2.4777,2.2035,4.4466,0.9734,0.4782,0.5346,4.1609,2.6351,0.2373,2.3757,0.098,1.7392,1.451,5.18,0.24,4.743,0.5653,2.3329,0.0774,0.2004,3.3136,3.7359,4.5168,3.2525,1.6048,0.4646,5.7896,0.3473,0.5604,0.0004,3.1666,1.4651,5.1255,0.0047,0.1789,3.475,1.313,3.493,3.3842,1.5081,0.3585,0.1103,1.689,2.6751,0.2424,2.8425,2.8518,3.9233,6.006,0.0332,0.4101,0.876,1.0891,0.3225,5.2784,0.638,1.3665,2.8352,6.0798,3.8761,1.172,4.3163,5.469,4.5172,1.8684,3.5048,0.0779,0.5146,2.0678,2.2628,4.375,0.1013,3.161,4.7794,3.3871,1.9044]}

This can give them a sense that the patient cares, that being there can be a powerful influence, that one thing doesn't change their world, that there's something inside of them to connect with with others\u2014especially friends\u2014and to find their way forward.\n\nAs a therapist, I can't be the only one who suffers from some kind of deep anxiety. In recent years, I have encountered many cases and patients who were not happy with the way they behaved in a stressful situation, nor who were afraid to speak openly during the crisis.\n\nWhile there may be some difference in how well a person responds to therapist questions and therapies, some people who are psychologically unhealthy are really not so well-behaved. That's okay\u2014they've made mistakes and done terrible things, and they feel bad (and are sad and feel bad about themselves) for that. At the same time, the relationship between therapist and patient is very important, especially if the therapist is a loving and supportive person. If that isn't clear, the client can begin trying to convince the therapist to come out of their shell and understand what their needs are; it's a very, very difficult therapy to go through right now.\n\nWe live in this moment of healing, at least in a practical sense, where we are all in a very clear category of \"healthy,\" \"normal,\" or even \"stable.\" However, the reality is that this doesn't always happen.\n\nWe are all sick people and we all have problems when it comes to managing these problems. For many people, these problems are quite easy; they get pushed through the cracks when one of us starts feeling the discomfort of others and being too defensive about having to fight. The only way to stay positive, and be safe, is by listening to someone around you. That is the first step in healing.\n\nIf you have any questions about where to start looking for help now, or if you have found a wonderful therapist, please drop me a line, and I'll help you find a therapist for you. Please let me know anything you're concerned about if it's your first visit.","token_len":527,"entropy":[5.4021,2.8774,9.5243,0.0752,1.653,3.8843,3.3156,3.5107,6.5087,4.5452,2.3221,10.7625,0.0593,4.0239,0.7826,0.0287,1.0889,1.919,4.6991,1.7985,4.4845,0.2141,1.4303,5.4186,2.5202,4.1413,1.5836,5.536,3.7876,0.0431,0.7361,1.4269,0.0235,2.9677,6.1469,5.8431,0.7325,4.7358,0.6889,0.1997,5.3538,1.2295,2.9789,5.5711,0.9853,0.1042,1.6205,5.0947,1.4763,5.6609,3.8677,3.4779,2.427,2.1894,1.3187,0.9548,2.586,1.3232,1.8956,0.3989,4.4975,0.0558,0.6281,2.4293,0.8776,1.9787,0.0002,3.6062,3.4583,3.6437,1.5937,5.8363,6.2229,0.8018,2.826,3.889,1.6252,2.6033,2.4582,0.5184,2.0628,5.7779,5.6393,4.1481,0.5654,1.041,4.3343,4.6812,0.2387,0.0012,1.2743,1.9621,0.5402,4.031,2.7328,6.1452,1.7557,1.1245,1.4015,2.778,2.4527,5.2162,6.5487,2.076,1.659,6.9021,2.7614,2.613,1.1576,1.4006,5.3016,2.2204,1.66,1.4378,5.2025,3.7686,5.4668,0.0003,2.1169,3.769,3.813,1.4864,1.0794,2.7717,1.6526,1.375,4.4927,1.1001,0.4194,3.5253,4.9219,0.5057,6.4669,2.648,5.9658,4.2608,4.9637,2.6391,1.2978,2.8028,4.2109,2.6428,1.9382,4.3842,0.2785,0.4315,0.0001,4.3047,1.451,0.5016,0.2417,0.9906,3.255,1.7518,3.641,2.9916,1.1212,0.2359,0.8784,5.3118,0.2383,4.895,2.0639,0.0007,5.4315,3.4532,1.5705,3.7893,6.1945,0.2121,0.3061,0.912,1.6076,3.4035,2.2576,4.1765,6.2425,3.1272,0.4874,2.575,3.7829,2.0345,0.8887,1.9149,0.4212,0.9322,4.3699,2.2414,3.1932,4.1346,0.5849,1.3999,5.9711,3.7001,1.3335,4.1397,0.4453,2.8546,4.2275,7.7782,1.9384,4.2778,0.3951,1.3835,0.0002,5.1562,2.6794,2.7091,0.2152,1.8048,5.7801,0.7353,1.8865,4.0071,1.0149,1.5098,1.7308,0.2115,5.5091,4.0169,2.0246,5.4162,0.1417,4.2701,1.5559,2.7985,1.2334,5.4054,5.0514,2.0166,5.7291,2.506,3.0568,3.0532,1.6672,1.5228,0.0019,0.7329,4.5051,0.8843,4.9199,2.7035,1.4647,4.1188,3.9249,1.0353,1.8447,4.4928,2.6788,0.0254,1.2224,0.9986,0.8761,4.8401,2.8036,6.778,1.6759,3.8857,4.6779,2.5973,5.2998,2.353,1.6286,0.7511,1.8116,1.9063,3.0226,0.3989,6.5489,0.6086,0.367,0.0029,0.0244,2.9133,5.7526,0.8324,1.0381,0.0394,0.3726,0.6728,2.6013,1.9984,1.6123,3.5042,1.6044,1.4561,1.0515,0.8393,2.4936,5.0087,1.5544,1.5823,0.3315,0.68,3.6991,3.762,3.7543,0.0002,3.3404,0.7358,2.5791,4.8751,2.3376,4.8596,5.3853,0.2488,4.435,1.1376,0.0874,1.185,4.7065,3.1248,0.9643,2.4929,1.3846,1.161,5.0435,1.8438,3.8941,3.9765,0.3795,4.9808,3.198,1.1172,2.3627,2.6082,4.329,0.0036,1.3764,5.747,1.5036,3.0429,0.0276,5.2997,0.2089,0.2422,0.2919,0.0001,4.8526,4.3775,0.0526,5.0843,3.3567,1.6758,4.7167,1.1391,5.7476,1.1279,1.1461,2.7787,5.4107,0.427,1.1919,1.7224,1.4513,2.4825,3.0752,3.0628,1.7269,3.1169,3.8224,6.3223,1.1258,2.7751,3.1212,2.4186,1.2692,3.1731,0.1581,2.1071,3.8216,0.1201,5.6327,0.3737,4.6362,0.0751,2.7958,3.2202,0.2724,0.2402,3.7269,3.5981,0.0004,1.228,2.475,0.5792,1.8697,0.0001,3.5508,2.0203,1.048,4.9781,2.9056,2.9718,1.3868,1.2016,1.2722,3.3963,4.6986,2.8016,0.042,0.0033,4.7904,3.5085,1.3637,0.3835,4.2992,1.6945,0.9197,0.3008,2.9875,0.8604,1.1461,5.3984,4.6059,6.1981,1.3975,4.8643,5.6163,3.1681,1.1349,1.9731,4.0838,5.2722,1.1257,1.366,4.1672,1.6572,3.6936,5.3664,1.5316,1.864,2.4686,4.8574,4.3978,5.2675,2.5285,5.235,0.8257,4.4031,3.2818,3.3627,3.5633,0.9112,0.4935,5.4917,4.0491,2.5842,2.196,3.2678,4.3018,0.8452,0.4334,3.2649,4.6522,0.4222,4.0026,4.8218,0.0501,1.1294,3.5977,2.4148,1.7829,3.2036,0.3612,1.6482,2.2505,0.6169,0.4028,0.0001,2.9857,0.5539,2.189,1.6248,0.434,0.766,6.1705,1.1358,1.019,4.5887,0.4703,1.4434,6.4633,0.304,1.8553,1.386,0.2279,1.3556,4.6487,1.0843,6.1395,0.4642,1.2463,1.7849,4.2183,0.7855,0.3765,0.0377,3.8603,1.677,0.1819,0.5969,3.4503,0.7371,1.2156,1.7965,1.2032,2.7283,0.0682,0.2887,5.1544,3.4462,0.0455,0.005,7.1071,0.3122,3.081,4.3279,0.0707,5.2956,4.0723,0.598,3.6523,0.4052,4.4293,1.256]}
{"id":4115,"ended":false,"length":485,"gen_text":"A kid about to get beaten by the school bully, when he delivers a mind-changing speech.\n\nNatalie B. (R), aka the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, is voiced by Nami Rhee from The LEGO Batman Movie.\n\n, aka the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, is voiced by Nami Rhee from The original Transformers: The Animated Series. During his youth, Cory is a bullied kid in Detroit and is fighting along with his parents for justice and independence. He has no problem meeting new people, but being a member of the street gang is not one thing.\n\nHe also has a bad reputation for being cruel to criminals.\n\n. In the cartoon, Cory is very depressed due to his anger. As a result, he can be a constant annoyance in the street, especially when he's around them, but it's really the parents, who help him out, who get him to talk to an officer.\n\nCory's actions have been shown several times in the video game LEGO Super Heroes. He can even be seen driving a van when he was younger and later on a bike, making fun of the whole street gangs from when he was very young.\n\nHe's also a gang member. When he was little he was so angry he yelled at a mob member, who later became his father.\n\nWhen the game was released on 8 March 2015, the game's main villain, Goliath, was given a new storyline by LEGO. As the game's plot progresses, Cory gets better and better.\n\nHis actions include beating multiple gangs during robberies, using a hammer, and getting into the car using his fist on a motorcycle, as well as his use of an M.P.H.M., an insect-like weapon used for self-defense. Although, he's extremely friendly to young kids, Cory is often called out for the actions by other characters. In The LEGO Batman Movie where he's said to never bite children, it may be seen by some that Goliath makes an attempt at stabbing Cory at some point in the video game to gain his attention.\n\nIn LEGO Batman: Arkham City, Cory's rage and bullying also become even more evident, with the police turning against him. The fact that he's one of the thugs involved in robberies is indicative of his rage being on the rise. On 10 February 2015, Cory became a villain again after having killed numerous thugs in the past two years. This time, he was also a new character for this game, despite being originally the older villain.\n\nGallery\n\nReferences","token_len":528,"entropy":[10.2588,6.6034,1.3765,2.7716,6.4582,1.661,3.0567,5.3326,2.7327,2.373,5.3352,1.1312,7.9541,0.823,9.46,0.4879,7.5348,0.9805,2.9118,1.918,0.0063,5.9691,3.4481,4.7589,2.0648,4.0276,5.006,2.9171,5.6263,3.3379,5.2416,0.9261,0.9095,0.0042,0.3092,0.7717,1.174,5.3646,0.0065,5.6246,3.9316,5.15,4.8799,4.2565,2.4292,4.0696,2.5429,0.3417,0.7127,1.1139,0.0002,9.8075,0.0598,0.0032,0.0046,0.0035,0.0001,0.0002,0.0013,0.0087,0.0021,0.001,0.0007,0.0222,0.001,0.0009,0.0001,0.0004,0.0952,11.0748,4.3507,2.6877,0.7274,1.1543,0.0404,0.858,7.3049,2.7054,4.5838,0.1736,6.2856,3.3842,1.6026,5.6552,1.6435,3.6646,5.9596,3.2123,2.4679,4.697,6.4195,1.1037,1.0245,3.8054,2.4463,2.7344,2.0777,3.709,0.3272,1.5875,2.9515,3.5886,4.1756,5.3658,3.7739,0.5878,1.3639,1.6749,5.3124,2.4151,5.1605,0.0169,0.7376,5.5886,0.7092,1.8916,2.3177,2.6785,5.5394,0.4081,1.375,0.0002,2.8872,3.1243,1.2925,0.6266,4.4418,2.582,1.3834,1.405,5.3859,1.4076,6.5714,0.9743,1.2194,0.0002,6.8955,4.8647,1.2425,5.0763,0.9548,0.822,1.0937,4.5424,5.5226,3.6269,0.0043,0.8342,5.2872,2.1821,4.4994,0.719,0.8534,0.2229,0.3306,4.3603,1.8776,2.9195,5.8137,3.8988,3.0888,1.0025,3.0082,1.8539,2.4944,1.2987,1.1954,1.6878,3.9583,5.6442,2.8101,2.8399,3.0966,0.9235,5.2775,3.8526,5.7108,2.957,2.1051,4.343,0.4066,1.7847,0.8828,1.0853,3.5587,1.0741,1.4249,3.5933,1.6857,6.1114,4.1797,1.4276,0.9066,0.0002,3.7493,0.0396,2.1921,5.2068,3.3685,2.4752,2.276,5.4874,0.0111,0.9361,0.5091,4.0042,0.2319,4.5089,5.6194,0.5631,1.3697,2.0416,2.9666,3.8092,0.6861,0.4931,5.5548,1.3562,3.5756,3.8961,0.9503,3.2143,3.004,2.6107,4.0513,3.1276,5.3171,4.7697,2.7187,4.5384,3.0851,0.0147,1.5827,5.9445,3.5369,3.9461,5.4618,5.951,0.213,0.1629,4.3836,0.2502,0.3447,0.6799,0.0002,2.4826,2.5798,0.7234,1.8069,5.8819,0.8818,3.1458,4.1361,1.2408,1.8036,4.4323,2.479,1.5029,5.5973,2.106,1.9751,4.8082,0.7284,2.686,5.2854,1.0846,1.7711,2.6692,4.987,2.9133,1.1387,2.6466,0.5136,1.0045,0.0002,3.2339,3.4196,4.3262,1.795,0.5571,3.0571,6.2178,3.887,2.9645,0.3775,1.9384,2.2547,1.9502,4.007,2.4703,1.1311,5.5616,2.9783,0.3311,0.7493,5.2421,0.839,2.0488,5.4766,2.6284,3.6268,1.8604,4.4355,2.2352,1.652,1.2432,4.3456,2.774,0.34,1.0203,3.7732,4.155,1.0837,0.4609,2.0833,1.2565,0.0001,3.7773,3.9772,4.1368,4.3695,6.0158,3.1778,4.4887,5.7683,0.9314,4.4513,1.7435,4.4157,1.6995,1.0365,4.1672,2.0567,3.6361,3.1157,6.8414,2.147,5.4473,4.1683,1.4811,3.8765,2.7125,2.3895,0.1014,0.0039,3.562,4.5995,0.0136,3.4584,4.9448,3.1831,3.0237,0.0075,3.4389,0.2026,4.2186,4.8921,3.2066,5.5617,2.8429,0.4284,2.0823,4.116,2.7,4.4712,0.2293,0.1996,0.6902,6.2385,3.5265,1.3806,2.1902,5.4651,5.2696,1.4542,5.301,1.6245,0.9574,2.1456,1.5728,3.7635,4.6001,1.8654,1.0488,4.0031,2.7435,4.7674,2.4961,2.0182,1.1829,3.3297,3.6033,0.321,0.4198,0.0225,6.1683,0.5258,2.0956,5.5053,0.0243,6.4777,5.5636,3.9349,0.6038,3.0187,5.0218,0.5373,3.8002,4.0685,1.8975,1.4629,5.1897,0.0036,5.6978,3.6177,1.8459,0.9478,5.3516,1.0058,4.1013,2.4826,0.0166,1.6541,0.2454,3.193,0.1047,4.4276,4.2888,1.5983,1.2907,0.3572,0.6006,0.0002,1.8197,2.7005,0.8507,0.8558,2.9193,0.7044,0.4834,1.0963,2.3376,5.8539,2.2532,4.082,4.829,3.4605,4.1706,0.2308,2.9425,2.8031,2.9919,2.2529,4.455,5.2314,3.7708,0.2711,2.1165,3.5149,4.9794,0.0696,0.6369,1.532,4.8543,0.0536,0.217,5.0218,3.8238,0.5663,4.8286,2.4326,5.5191,0.2479,1.0403,2.9644,4.2484,4.6681,1.3398,0.4765,0.743,5.9562,6.7595,2.3943,1.3926,0.2495,2.3088,4.3983,1.5906,4.5456,3.6563,2.9556,4.0646,4.4779,5.9439,2.5549,1.6796,0.8492,2.9101,3.4176,0.8403,0.4731,3.8549,0.1406,0.4663,0.8588,1.7221,3.4069,2.4274,4.8549,2.2342,3.6923,3.9227,0.5051,1.3182,5.2906,1.2485,4.2934,3.5944,5.55,1.5929,1.2408,0.6283,0.0001,3.9661,0.4691,0.0002,3.3319]}

The first group was led by Captain Jack Sparrow and the members of the Black Cowl were sent to investigate a ship belonging to a secret police organisation. After hearing an alarm going off, the group took off to search for the ship while another group followed them. Following the members of the Black Crowes, Captain Jack Sparrow found the ship, and later led them to the base on Earth, where an officer named \"Tyranny\" led them to safety.[1]\n\nAs a part of the expedition, Tyranny also accompanied Jack Sparrow to protect James Rolf on a ship, however, when the captain tried to kidnap him, he was thwarted.[3] The new group quickly came to the surface, however, which turned out to be the only way Sparrow escaped. As the group had been separated, Tyranny managed to convince Jack Sparrow to help her escape on a rescue mission, allowing him to return to his ship.[4]\n\nEventually, after a long battle, Tyranny and Captain Jack Sparrow and Jack arrived at the city.[5] After the group, Captain Jack Sparrow left aboard the ship, but only after their ship had been stolen by Jack Sparrow at the beginning of the mission.[6]\n\nTrivia Edit\n\nCaptain Jack Sparrow is the first Captain Jack Sparrow to live in New Rochelle. He is also the first Black Crow to be killed. The first time Capt. Jack Sparrow killed an enemy officer was in the novel The New Captain, for which he was named.[7] During the end credits of the video game: Invasion: New Orleans the crew of the Black Crowes have a very different approach to dealing with Captain Jack Sparrow than they did in the novel The New Assassin The Crew of the Black Crowes: The Secret War for Colonial America, where the officers on the crew had to resort to their usual method of attacking enemy ships.[6][8] T.L.

The inhabitants are divided between human and robotic, who can sometimes be considered robots because of their ability to form and interact with their bodies.\n\nWhile the majority humans have limited mobility and may be somewhat disoriented due to their humanoid proportions, the robot AI of the game is capable of travelling at any speed.\n\nA majority of the AI's AI actions are human-like, with minor humanoid traits ranging from robotic to anthropomorphic. The AI with the largest number of robots can perform a variety of actions, from manipulating objects for food items to interacting with humans with a simple command.\n\nIn Robot: Humanity: Real Time Adventures, a large number of robots are created, mostly with military-inspired abilities. Some are humanoid, but can occasionally change their appearance from humanoid to humanoid.\n\nIn Robot: Civilization: Cyberpunk Adventures, some robots are artificial intelligence based, so some of the robots have artificial intelligence in their heads, or even in their heads at least. A few of these AI have a set of sensors that they run through through their bodies, but there are no humans on the planet where they operate. Most robots are equipped with sensors which will see them in real time, such as when they are looking at their enemies, when they are doing something and when they are interacting with the real world. Unlike other AI in this world, a certain number of robots are also equipped with unique weapons and even vehicles, such as human-sized rockets and human-sized armored vehicles.\n\nRescue bots have a greater ability to see human characters on the ground, as they can also help with rescue at the beginning of the mission.\n\nAll robots in the game have a power source: the Robot-Egg.

{"id":737,"ended":true,"length":493,"gen_text":"There's all kinds of dark things in these woods... you never know if that dark thing is going to be on the other side of the bed because it's going to be lit,' says Dr. Sattar, adding that in the woods it's hard to see into other people's eyes.\n\nAnother concern for some researchers is that these homes may be more vulnerable to fire suppression, and that such homes have poor fire detection options that can give rise to fires that can turn out to have been caused by natural fires. (For more details on these and other factors affecting home fire behavior, see \"Fire Safety: How to Avoid Firing A Burning Home: Why Can't We Avoid Fires?\" by Christopher J. Johnson.)\n\nResearch has also found that living in large homes with less than three acres can give rise to the largest fires that are probably caused by low humidity and, as well, natural fire suppression. A few months ago, a large home fire at a construction site in Oklahoma sent more than 100 people into flames, destroying and damaging several units. As of now, the blaze is still too small to be considered a wildfire (we can only assume that the fire was set by one individual, so it's possible fires will still be in the vicinity of the building, either as a result of natural fire suppression or the building was built on fire)\n\nFirefighting techniques could be used in remote areas to combat wildfires. Firefighters are trained to use pepper spray that can deter smoke, smoke-removal substances, and fire-fighting equipment. If an owner comes within 5, 15 or 20 feet of a building, you're still in effect in this case.\n\nResearchers also recently published research on the efficacy of a water purifier in managing a wildfire. Researchers found that water purifiers are safe to use, especially if they were used in isolation from the other components of the house.\n\nWhile this paper was focused only on one type of fire, it did include information on people using firefighting techniques for burning homes, which was helpful in understanding how wildfires could occur in the home and how they can affect a person's health risk.\n\nThis area of research, called the \"Majestic Fire,\" found that firefighting techniques employed in remote regions are important for keeping people safe. Firefighting has been successfully used to help residents mitigate wildfires. The technique is described in \"Understanding Respiratory Protection: Firefighting, Water Purifiers, Firefighting Practices, and Re-Aging Practices in the Northern Virginia Desert,\" co-authored by Paul E.

As a reflection, I can change you the way you want to change.\"\n\nYou start talking to yourself about things in your life, your relationship history, what your favorite band are, and most importantly\u2026\n\nYour reflection: \"People have things I'm afraid of because I'm too good. I want to be great, but I don't feel confident enough to have a good life like I want. I want to do things that are very stressful for others, but I don't understand the reasons why people like me feel bad so often. So I start asking: I want to feel good about myself, but I don't understand how I could always fix those things I do the same way over and over again.\"\n\nYour answer as you talk to yourself: \"What will I be better like for others?\" Your reflection says: \"You can change your approach if necessary, but then I can't change it right now. I can't change myself for the long distance I'm trying to take, so I have to find ways to change I don't understand. I need to go through things that are uncomfortable for different people. People will ask: why is I doing this? Why am I being so weird and crazy? Is it because I'm going through some kind of trauma that will make others feel strange about me? Then, what do I do when I feel uncomfortable? What can I do to make others feel okay about themselves? I am trying to do this, you're not.\"\n\nSo you've made a choice and you're ready to give your reflection another try and try again.\n\nWhat about your life? How do you think about yourself now?\n\n[h\/t: NailBlank, The Art of Living with a Purpose, and this essay from The Wire]","token_len":535,"entropy":[9.9645,0.0801,4.0974,1.5504,4.5699,0.753,0.2832,0.1033,1.3613,5.5774,1.5188,2.0828,3.7548,5.1597,0.3459,7.2437,2.575,5.6268,3.7043,10.0319,6.3183,4.0696,4.4456,4.9294,6.9995,2.3796,0.9093,3.4406,4.5331,4.7875,2.5066,5.1283,3.1348,0.4799,2.6899,9.499,1.8083,0.1,3.7127,4.1953,1.8707,1.8832,5.0522,2.6781,1.0566,4.4005,3.5768,2.394,3.4815,4.2571,0.2048,4.1556,0.5064,3.0399,0.1708,1.7623,3.3866,1.8693,1.9603,1.0799,2.2357,2.1694,1.2489,2.7093,3.5411,0.5208,3.5003,3.665,3.3547,2.6404,1.6708,1.8327,0.7302,4.1195,0.3,3.358,2.6935,2.7206,2.0548,6.4452,1.1235,3.346,0.4857,3.4075,0.1763,4.5272,1.7952,1.8509,0.9118,6.7447,0.0112,1.1549,1.2525,1.4181,0.7583,0.0334,3.4347,4.491,3.0888,1.5898,1.9251,4.6815,3.4291,0.7668,3.0126,1.8785,0.5491,1.239,0.7083,1.411,0.25,0.0003,2.0725,3.6676,4.2556,2.7468,0.7532,3.3096,1.0935,2.7246,1.676,1.262,0.8105,2.7749,2.1371,1.8271,0.9643,2.5621,3.8161,5.6542,2.1959,1.2459,1.776,1.2582,0.393,0.0022,2.9305,3.7756,4.397,0.758,1.5244,0.3282,0.8604,5.5557,0.292,2.8698,1.0713,1.7598,4.2553,2.8123,0.0822,0.4596,2.8271,1.3805,0.7792,0.3916,0.1541,0.0635,0.1208,0.0387,0.0091,0.4212,5.6903,0.0002,2.7708,3.8955,1.6161,5.5204,2.3463,2.6258,0.6313,1.3973,3.1578,4.6312,2.9154,4.9078,0.692,1.2393,0.413,1.0791,2.2,2.4482,0.2415,0.0002,2.2513,4.1915,3.9965,0.8973,1.0597,1.9801,3.5092,3.5502,0.9771,0.1836,1.8536,3.3572,3.8025,5.6088,0.4703,3.2807,2.47,3.7219,3.9007,3.986,0.8044,1.5965,4.5391,0.3163,5.1798,1.7717,0.0002,2.6794,1.4339,1.4116,0.2468,6.0615,3.1675,4.8769,3.4161,2.6975,3.5235,0.5374,2.7413,0.7472,0.8652,3.5415,3.9444,2.1619,1.012,3.1168,0.4685,1.0831,4.8236,2.005,0.6741,0.434,1.6581,0.0005,3.7837,4.9589,0.748,1.3314,3.6013,2.045,1.8099,1.4082,5.5752,1.329,1.2782,1.7352,0.7203,1.1046,0.3097,3.6723,1.4918,1.2881,2.2067,5.5404,4.6286,1.5031,3.4431,1.3772,1.1959,0.6926,1.2533,0.0005,5.6928,3.1201,3.4616,0.746,1.6775,3.1888,0.1012,3.5822,2.9007,4.8957,3.2142,0.5326,3.968,0.7369,4.2981,2.4884,4.7354,4.5726,1.7585,0.3174,3.8722,1.2297,0.9725,0.3867,1.2507,0.6576,0.873,0.9227,0.0007,1.6325,2.6126,1.8029,3.4215,5.4609,6.405,3.1445,0.9041,3.011,2.4628,5.7912,1.9795,0.2175,5.5849,0.0438,0.0033,0.7421,1.2759,0.0679,0.0002,0.9694,1.6316,12.0044,2.195,2.6019,1.2094,0.0948,0.2712,0.0348,3.9402,4.9057,1.499,2.4102,4.2879,5.7937,4.1602,3.2282,1.912,3.3311,0.6296,1.0851,0.6643,0.032,2.8612,2.3728,2.5564,2.1496,6.1375,4.0666,6.907,1.4312,0.2146,4.907,1.5306,2.8854,1.0821,1.0346,2.1837,4.1438,0.6125,0.6548,0.9501,1.9014,0.7601,0.9762,2.997,3.7202,1.3373,3.1868,8.3468,3.3049,1.9282,5.4784,0.1927,3.8809,2.5756,1.7767,0.3862,2.2295,0.0436,3.1145,2.3783,0.2726,2.086,6.4953,2.6369,0.0003,2.3604,1.2577,1.1078,2.3039,0.2712,4.6205,1.4565,4.4692,1.2978,1.4169,4.6785,0.8738,7.207,0.1371,1.5802,4.3091,3.0518,4.4171,1.9631,3.8537,2.5022,3.2703,2.0001,0.523,0.8181,1.0978,0.9702,0.019,4.0522,1.2103,5.2935,2.0977,3.9201,0.8923,3.684,0.968,0.818,0.2455,0.6183,4.8074,1.6124,3.2125,2.7951,0.0017,2.4666,2.9539,4.7348,1.384,4.3506,1.5559,5.9375,2.4816,0.1769,0.8201,5.1568,3.7391,3.4757,2.2879,0.1153,0.3878,3.5293,0.691,1.1642,2.68,1.077,1.8975,2.4864,0.0538,0.1688,0.5418,1.6628,2.3547,0.3088,2.8048,0.8882,2.8421,1.1975,1.6977,4.5202,2.7242,0.0912,3.1388,2.2732,2.6601,5.1371,1.7868,2.3522,2.014,0.0423,0.0002,4.8557,1.9536,2.9165,3.83,1.6565,2.0577,2.0425,1.3526,0.8771,1.6662,0.149,4.7918,2.5625,1.081,2.7683,1.7637,3.6668,3.66,0.9407,0.3259,1.1261,0.0004,3.2663,3.2689,2.1827,3.0828,1.2126,2.8394,1.2657,0.0443,2.525,1.488,2.1617,3.5737,0.2808,1.4065,0.0003,4.5567,5.0109,0.0595,0.0023,1.3484,5.9337,5.6226,5.6568,3.0644,4.137,3.4777,4.706,0.2364,3.7277,2.8062,2.9385,4.4093,2.9218,1.5585,4.698,5.0264,3.2683,2.5927,5.8096,1.153]}
{"id":4766,"ended":false,"length":484,"gen_text":"After repeatedly failing to prevent the existence of John Connor, Skynet decides to try a different tactic. The year is 1374, and a Terminator has just arrived in Medieval Europe.\n\nHowever, that idea is almost doomed by the moment. Skynet decides to use a special attack known as the Krakatoi Death Claw to keep everyone hostage in the Medieval realm: as the Joker's new apprentice, he is forced to make his own deal with Batman after finding and killing the previous Joker.\n\nLater on, Skynet learns he is no longer the only one who can stop the new Joker, after being stopped by Batman with the use of The Power Pack and the Power Surge; he also knows that Batman killed him by destroying the rest of the universe. This will be his final attempt at saving his life. As a result, Skynet is the only one who can stop the Joker.\n\nThis trope can also be found in some other cases. In the case of Jack White, where there is a plot to get the Black Knight to fight alongside the Joker during the second world war, the hero may decide to make a deal with the Joker. In such an incident, the Joker will stop killing anyone and only the heroes will do so (in this case, Jack). The Joker will then give the heroes some money: The Joker will then kill the Batman and start the destruction.\n\nThe \"real world\" story in the game Batman and Robin has always found a problem solving solution to this trope (the two Batman heroes were on that bus as they watched the game). The Joker will now be the one to get them to the place they were going to stop the Joker if necessary, even though only the two would end up fighting on their own, as they had already won both of their trials before. The plot is in very real ways similar to the movie Black Mirror where the Joker, in an attempt to save his fellow heroes, is allowed to escape through the tunnel by himself.\n\nCompare with the \"real world\" trope in which the protagonist is given a choice, if any, which side he thinks he can continue to escape, or not. A \"real\" problem solving solution can even include the destruction of the world itself; with the exception of a few places, you can't possibly have the protagonist survive without his powers.\n\nExamples:\n\nopen\/close all folders\n\nAnime & Manga\n\nFilms \u2014 Animated\n\nFilms \u2014 Live-Action\n\nLiterature\n\nLive-Action TV\n\nRole Play\n\nVideo Games\n\nWestern Animation\n\nReal Life","token_len":536,"entropy":[9.5991,5.2282,0.145,5.7697,1.8148,7.398,0.0113,8.2381,5.9864,1.3812,8.5446,2.3617,0.1606,6.7789,0.1322,4.3086,4.5862,1.236,2.5995,1.0127,3.1876,8.4015,1.7479,5.7225,4.5021,1.1727,0.4457,3.1995,11.2612,2.5516,2.6673,1.5429,1.6564,11.4237,1.0654,0.4358,2.6731,0.0025,4.819,0.0549,5.5632,6.2015,1.6591,5.5075,5.6818,3.2216,0.697,5.87,2.4995,2.6429,0.0002,0.0007,3.1257,0.1867,2.9025,1.5543,4.0271,4.1699,4.3694,0.0148,1.1026,6.1056,4.2076,1.0978,1.1567,5.6265,4.0806,1.5533,5.2748,4.884,6.1054,3.2009,1.809,4.6393,5.0825,4.7021,5.6323,2.1124,5.88,3.0397,4.0361,3.5932,0.4259,1.1546,2.452,2.1786,0.0466,3.8224,2.6558,2.1262,4.9152,0.5971,6.3037,5.8405,4.57,5.3856,1.7049,1.4848,5.9191,1.9913,0.9934,1.3537,0.0002,5.3516,2.3043,0.3419,1.3443,0.0006,0.001,3.7783,4.8468,1.5561,3.5046,0.3311,1.5199,2.2713,0.7135,1.2805,1.2382,1.9669,0.7574,5.0992,0.3824,1.4572,4.4806,3.3596,4.8789,0.3683,2.5511,5.2615,0.9422,4.9141,0.0007,5.4194,4.8989,6.4803,3.4612,1.6291,3.2989,4.738,6.4713,2.2247,2.6164,5.0193,0.968,2.283,6.7179,2.2076,3.4075,5.1211,1.2515,5.765,0.0075,0.5345,4.2979,0.8979,3.6757,4.8138,2.5645,2.4338,1.6374,2.1118,1.0945,1.8635,2.597,1.3888,1.0696,4.5318,2.3005,0.2981,0.2576,1.5493,0.0008,0.0008,1.7166,4.2218,0.8995,0.6319,0.8689,0.5852,1.1026,0.7304,0.5201,1.1764,0.5254,0.0002,4.108,5.3709,4.4973,1.1049,0.2758,3.8168,0.3277,4.0407,2.4505,5.3615,1.613,1.7038,1.3273,2.8297,0.028,5.9563,4.8899,0.4294,4.6319,4.7554,0.6308,0.936,4.6496,0.8085,3.7425,1.8182,5.3027,0.7656,1.2708,4.3341,4.0597,1.0921,0.8616,5.7803,0.699,5.0587,3.7958,0.003,0.2599,1.6747,5.482,5.0968,3.1457,0.3296,3.7275,1.182,0.63,0.1502,0.7242,1.0088,2.3336,2.2575,4.3044,2.0822,3.9711,0.085,0.9105,1.092,1.531,4.7577,5.4369,2.8886,2.3597,3.6872,2.5072,3.8444,1.201,4.4717,0.7559,4.424,3.5033,1.4875,0.1444,0.3363,3.2299,3.948,3.0034,1.5539,1.5145,1.3441,4.2419,1.4946,3.4699,3.6451,2.6727,5.6781,4.5662,0.5306,0.842,1.5799,3.1675,1.3935,4.0339,1.5712,4.8835,1.6877,5.6346,2.6702,1.0917,0.0002,2.4609,4.8371,5.2176,2.2528,0.3026,4.3052,2.9655,1.9854,4.716,3.5369,3.051,0.245,3.0385,5.5283,5.8528,1.5489,6.8108,6.5915,2.851,1.0898,1.1869,1.5732,4.2258,3.1334,5.2265,3.787,3.1816,3.9855,4.2142,6.1681,5.5036,5.0162,1.957,4.277,0.9694,4.9662,1.3343,2.1883,2.1653,2.7088,5.3114,2.7219,2.3809,1.4953,0.7853,3.5548,3.4727,1.1482,2.3824,4.9478,2.256,2.0376,2.4858,1.1231,2.5416,0.8294,1.0647,5.3294,4.0448,1.4788,3.4171,1.6792,5.6595,1.0356,3.0856,5.6025,4.3694,0.0182,2.4783,4.7233,1.538,0.0423,2.7061,2.6182,1.7945,2.8577,1.877,4.7073,4.9194,1.5586,1.4456,5.6972,2.5912,0.6044,2.4558,4.9421,2.2699,5.021,5.6717,3.5006,6.3602,2.4593,0.2031,0.893,5.1844,5.8672,2.0692,2.3093,0.9039,1.1258,4.2986,2.864,3.4055,0.3173,0.0187,1.9605,1.4193,3.6362,1.6988,0.473,2.4883,5.5421,0.0924,3.486,3.9905,1.1071,4.6341,4.0855,3.4716,0.8975,0.9461,0.0002,3.075,3.0775,1.219,2.8807,1.6025,0.1867,0.1085,3.1617,1.3843,3.0528,0.8994,4.2663,1.4601,3.9414,1.0731,1.8746,2.9083,3.686,5.3054,0.2468,4.1419,1.8729,0.9508,5.4381,1.6344,2.4035,5.7665,1.9178,5.8567,2.2696,1.5867,4.3975,0.6628,4.2281,3.8478,0.6186,1.8557,4.9005,0.4123,2.3624,2.1848,4.1024,3.195,2.0622,5.7631,0.0321,0.9921,1.724,3.1559,4.2307,5.1048,0.9176,2.4364,0.0127,2.8341,2.3431,4.2711,0.9984,6.0253,0.8905,2.1346,5.5711,3.1227,1.8229,5.1544,4.8324,1.9444,3.8879,4.1713,0.8792,0.7402,0.0002,1.1736,0.3214,0.0402,0.0002,0.0021,0.0,0.0,0.0001,0.0,0.0039,0.0002,0.2151,0.0004,0.5289,0.0001,0.0035,0.0003,4.7994,0.0,0.0013,1.3387,0.0026,0.0002,1.3087,0.0004,0.0086,0.0002,0.0041,0.0002,0.0048,0.0001,0.0386,0.0005,0.0055,0.0002,0.0841,0.2009,0.0004,0.0009,0.0091,0.0001,6.844,2.4822,0.1953,0.0002,3.4821,0.0025,0.0043,0.0002,3.528,0.0015,0.4799,0.0002,0.722,0.0443]}

{"id":1282,"ended":true,"length":514,"gen_text":"A bald man who lives completely alone suddenly finds hair clogging his shower drain... and turns it in for the sun... and the day gets better for him.\n\n\"It looks good,\" he says.\n\n\"I'd love to work at a restaurant, and if you have a problem, I'll make it right for you,\" his sister tells him. \"I didn't think it would lead to much better relations.\"\n\nThe relationship seems to exist.\n\nHe tries to have children.\n\nHis wife has no children who can afford the legal expenses; he never knew they had any children. Her oldest, with a 4-year-old, is one of those women.\n\nThen, more precisely, he starts dating his wife, her mother, with little patience and no love. He says he's been struggling with the fact that he will always be his father and not someone he can date, nor will he have any other relationship his wife would have with him. This may sound like a good argument for a breakup. A relationship with her should not be one of them. She should have a boyfriend, although he never went on to have a romance with him.\n\nBut all this has happened to the two of them, and now there's no love. So what if she asks her kids to go to college for her? What if my life's the same? What if my dad is a little harder on himself than mom and dad seem to be? What if this happens to me at least a little? And when the time comes, if it doesn't then I can't go see my kids on Thanksgiving?\n\nI want my husband to know that my husband is not a complete jerk, a narcissist, I am a person with feelings and my emotions. No, that's not how we make love; there is no relationship I can develop with my husband.\n\nInstead, I want him to know that I am not a total asshole, that we could be friends, have something in common, share a room together. I want him to know I am not completely in love with him.

{"id":4229,"ended":false,"length":524,"gen_text":"Choose a famous first sentence from fiction and write a story that goes in a different direction than the original work, usually in one direction. (You will not be pleased.) The original novel will be more interesting if you make it from a different direction and have the same characters. Also, I recommend not starting with everything you learned about your novel and reading after that. It may seem like all this and that is the case.\n\nIt is a very good idea to follow this strategy. However, it is easy to lose confidence when you are writing novels. The first book will be read with more than one character. The second one never came out for any reason since it is a small book. A few things: If you do not love the first story, then the second story can be a mistake. You will have to work with the third and fourth story. There are many different approaches, and the books you find will be very different, but there are a number of common mistakes.\n\nIf things got out of control, it wouldn't make any difference. If things got out of control, it will become very boring. If things got out of control, it will become quite tedious (you might be able to use the old way to write the first chapter, like I did for the rest of the novel, but then I went back and did 'cuckoo' the next chapter and made no progress.) If things get out of control, it will become very tedious (you might be able to use the past way to write the second chapter, like I did for the rest of the novel, but then I went back and did 'cuckoo' the next chapter and made no progress.)\n\nThen I should ask myself at my beginning a little more: where is the problem? What I am saying is if I do not want to go back to a different book, why should I start with the first one? I want to be able to read it and re-read it when it was last put out, so you know what I mean: if I want to go back to the same writing from one book to another, I should start with the third book and see if I can find something that works even as you write it. But if my problem is with just one point of your novel, I have to ask another one: what has changed?\n\nI will not answer these questions now. The point is to take some inspiration from the real world and try to create an original fiction that would meet new conditions for this kind of story.\n\nIf you are interested in reading this book on demand, please e-mail me at [email protected]","token_len":541,"entropy":[3.7212,10.5253,8.0142,7.1161,3.0825,8.2334,2.7402,3.7611,2.0197,3.1303,2.0629,4.9242,4.2027,2.1976,1.314,0.1811,3.5168,1.0753,2.4762,6.0579,2.5783,5.3754,2.4734,3.8621,2.5581,0.686,4.5437,3.4581,3.9072,2.9708,1.4843,6.0427,3.0545,3.4222,3.5155,4.1723,1.5459,1.3436,3.9335,2.8814,2.2145,0.773,4.4756,1.1621,5.1058,1.56,1.1262,1.676,2.9554,3.4654,2.2248,1.8772,3.6205,0.9384,4.7157,0.3923,4.4499,2.8239,4.2159,5.1301,1.2442,6.3542,1.7962,4.2469,2.9707,3.7373,3.1397,2.6351,2.9445,5.264,2.0427,0.5318,2.5756,2.5634,3.0239,1.2228,4.5465,3.654,4.99,1.8252,1.7752,3.0153,4.3041,1.0713,1.9119,0.0199,4.4126,0.9292,3.1132,3.0525,2.3285,0.7236,0.1331,4.9432,3.1719,4.8888,1.5628,5.1851,0.0484,2.217,0.6075,4.9642,0.1495,2.8912,5.6886,2.3681,0.8776,2.5847,1.8928,4.4824,1.4458,2.8674,2.5361,4.5559,2.3192,1.3322,5.0281,3.2417,4.6221,3.1813,0.3722,1.237,1.2049,2.4768,1.2332,2.3218,7.2818,5.919,0.9093,4.739,4.4955,0.4476,7.0434,1.3953,1.2665,2.1091,4.9931,1.5178,0.7323,4.6582,3.2622,3.7975,4.6791,5.04,0.4615,3.3022,0.2381,5.8019,1.1224,1.6232,3.5294,0.6028,2.2166,2.9368,0.4775,1.9583,4.2141,0.6769,2.3038,4.8725,0.4916,3.1706,1.5346,2.0824,0.3681,4.4009,2.8117,1.5772,3.1886,2.7077,0.4246,1.7555,1.9616,4.317,0.7587,1.7966,2.2472,5.3762,2.8081,2.3198,2.7505,5.0362,1.901,4.3503,1.9024,1.3856,3.4285,0.3023,3.8237,1.0274,3.6163,0.8487,2.5919,3.0486,0.0567,3.5165,1.3053,1.1003,0.8586,0.0002,2.7494,7.2238,5.6996,2.0649,0.1524,2.5953,0.6976,3.0086,6.7452,0.0011,3.5389,1.6435,0.8069,1.2799,2.4288,1.402,0.8563,0.5246,0.0158,0.0659,0.3571,1.4019,3.3436,5.231,2.6355,3.8263,0.5051,1.7515,0.4229,0.1658,0.0699,0.0029,0.0055,0.0464,0.6415,0.3786,0.6532,4.6741,4.6273,5.045,3.2974,3.0647,2.7284,1.8664,0.0059,4.3317,1.8765,5.5996,4.0961,1.9831,2.5242,2.7912,1.5471,3.3525,2.0553,5.4062,2.7088,0.457,3.0279,0.9231,5.7459,0.0964,0.6214,1.3802,2.0938,0.8949,4.1705,2.5773,5.0014,0.968,1.1633,2.5639,6.0587,5.6002,5.3561,0.8475,2.104,3.6907,1.4923,1.2951,2.4437,4.2166,4.1077,1.7465,2.2887,1.9623,0.6241,3.0239,0.1736,0.0104,0.0176,0.1369,0.7629,0.4365,0.479,1.1966,2.9727,1.1157,0.6997,0.2609,0.1747,0.0111,0.0026,0.1377,0.033,9.2684,0.3897,0.1373,0.0163,0.1366,2.8075,0.1574,0.1711,0.1071,0.0136,0.0054,0.0584,0.0049,0.0084,0.0006,0.0029,0.0992,0.1279,0.0077,0.0077,0.0054,0.0357,0.0019,0.0052,0.0183,0.0851,0.0999,0.0029,0.0006,0.0351,0.0028,0.0181,0.0049,0.01,0.0017,0.0045,0.0001,0.2297,1.7167,0.0001,5.5407,3.9244,4.9094,4.0188,2.1336,6.9055,5.4158,4.2485,5.7364,3.7022,1.849,1.9337,5.1542,2.2282,0.4803,4.0426,0.7263,2.6213,5.9282,1.1074,2.9689,0.361,5.5048,1.1277,3.1686,0.1726,2.5229,0.3523,4.0961,1.1388,1.0453,3.0676,3.1046,2.8289,0.7884,2.8112,1.3384,0.0276,3.5302,1.4221,1.0914,0.7992,0.5742,0.5345,2.2052,2.8017,0.2115,3.2378,0.7785,0.0035,2.3643,2.2549,2.8829,5.7697,0.346,0.223,0.1301,4.5373,2.0652,2.8709,4.0719,6.1628,0.9331,2.1995,2.094,5.3164,3.6245,1.4084,0.7366,0.2472,4.041,1.9814,1.1148,1.9252,0.0904,2.2389,0.0737,0.2803,0.8986,3.0446,6.9065,4.6898,3.818,0.9052,1.0502,1.0999,0.2264,1.337,1.4897,1.8266,0.3974,0.4126,4.0955,1.6755,1.8332,5.4494,1.2547,0.7685,0.3352,2.2023,1.8761,1.6398,1.8551,6.1572,5.842,5.4775,2.1167,0.6521,0.3357,3.6044,1.2504,4.8585,2.8123,0.3254,2.4611,5.7464,0.9535,5.7904,1.1604,3.1796,0.7313,0.2835,1.856,3.272,0.861,2.0701,5.4561,2.8681,1.586,1.9161,5.1911,2.202,1.5821,1.4209,0.0003,2.5217,3.1336,2.849,3.8209,2.5521,0.1408,5.0999,0.7366,3.3004,3.7148,0.4091,1.7873,4.6388,3.2181,5.1952,0.3403,1.5299,4.7133,0.6798,0.917,2.1647,0.3298,3.607,3.2796,2.4102,4.6294,1.2645,4.576,5.3144,5.8977,3.4448,2.9145,6.0921,2.2492,0.0004,4.1908,0.2808,1.3676,0.0002,3.0077,0.4972,1.7053,2.3748,0.1403,1.5384,1.9925,0.7517,5.0381,6.1543,0.3142,1.6835,4.8991,0.0031,0.0077,0.3013,0.6726,3.2776,0.0139,0.0001,0.4484]}
{"id":881,"ended":true,"length":503,"gen_text":"Time travel is invented, but rather than preserve the timeline, an agency is created improve history as much as possible.\n\nHowever, that is exactly what is needed to create an agency.\n\nThe fact is that with all the things that have changed across previous civilizations, the way that humans have changed across time may be the best way to find those changes.\n\nTherefore, without understanding all time and its place in the universe, we will quickly become ignorant about how time came together.\n\nIf we could understand how time came together, we could have an understanding of how the universe is set up to move the universe forward.\n\nIt would be easier for us to understand our world than it is to understand how it is going to evolve later on.\n\nMoreover, if we study a particular time and our current reality, this allows us to understand its place in the timeline we were given and the history that it will lead to, so there is no need to get rid of all our outdated perspective about some of the other world.\n\nFinally, if we understand how the universe is set up to create the space for some new worlds, like Venus, we can quickly become enlightened that our current world is not destined for being completely destroyed, even if we did destroy it every once in awhile.\n\nAs a former president I love the thought of my children coming across the idea of this amazing time machine, we were already very close friends.\n\nAnd we wanted to help.\n\nWe loved our children so much that we even wanted to get our hands on them to help us understand what our future was.\n\nAnd so, we gave them the time machine, and you, so their children will know that we love them at the same time.\n\nThe very idea of how your children will live their future is very important to them, even if you don't know how time will happen in the future.\n\nThey don't want to live it for too long and never even think about it again.\n\nBut for them, it's not enough that your children will care not about the future at all.\n\nThey want to know that they will have a better future than what they have today even as you, the President have tried

When they had time to get up and go, they'd also go away, and the researchers also found that when people were on top of rock, they're more likely to commit suicide.\n\nThe new findings, which were published in Psychology of Relationships, also suggest that when a person wakes up to find someone with a mental illness, they're less likely to choose to do something else with their life.\n\nA good wake is one that encourages us to wake up, and encourages us to do things in the way that we're about to find out. As part of our recovery, however, we need to learn to wake up so we can stay positive about ourselves.\n\n\"The good news is that we don't have to feel bad for those who woke up, because we won't have to,\" said co-author Lauren C. Kress, Ph.D., professor of psychology at the University of Florida (UF)'s Department of Psychological Science.\n\n\"That's just an important note to us and we need to make those decisions on where the bed should go and where we place our body that are as clear and intuitive as you want it to be.\"\n\nIn previous studies, the researchers found that when an individual sleeps, they wake up, then spend time in a mental hospital, but only after their immune system has returned.\n\nResearchers also found that when a person sleeps, they've had time to rest up during their most critical period of their lives, and before they move out of that part of the body.\n\nBecause of the amount of time that it takes for the immune system to heal, it may be easier for you to forget about yourself, the researchers said; and, because of that time spent resting up during a mental hospital, you can feel better about yourself.\n\nKress said that the new findings do suggest that you have to balance being happy with your health and your body, and to be kind for others and try to manage a lack of good memories.\n\n\"People who wake up with a physical illness are less likely to go to the mental asylum, and those people who wake up with high level of stress tend to be less comfortable and have fewer regrets,\" she said. \"Because after that, we don't need to take our own actions to get better.\"","token_len":542,"entropy":[6.8149,4.4261,11.9552,2.6884,4.5702,0.4951,5.0536,5.7661,1.8184,1.8554,7.1943,3.5544,5.1186,0.664,0.9696,0.0588,0.5957,1.6487,0.0058,3.8941,3.0758,2.9036,4.7173,1.4148,5.7912,2.0015,5.6635,2.3155,3.7947,2.8084,2.3271,0.636,0.1759,1.3349,0.0003,2.2979,5.6092,2.9827,0.5913,3.2848,5.2158,2.1636,5.3179,5.6447,0.0828,1.0355,4.4991,4.5639,2.4492,1.0911,1.0496,4.8746,2.9771,3.979,6.2791,0.1923,3.7189,1.414,2.1446,4.6388,1.2033,4.2387,0.7193,4.3651,3.2466,0.2089,3.6741,2.4041,0.4387,3.3128,0.753,3.8319,1.6333,0.2541,3.7915,1.2714,1.4976,1.7984,1.7633,0.3553,0.8052,3.032,3.7281,6.7202,2.6622,2.7237,2.7331,3.8096,3.6512,0.3829,0.2441,1.5011,1.7329,0.8588,1.4557,0.1869,0.0853,3.3229,1.0695,0.3147,5.2636,1.2286,0.1266,0.0325,5.3918,0.3142,0.5,0.2213,0.0002,2.1835,4.2907,2.1574,2.5688,1.5564,1.0178,0.2275,0.8635,6.6426,0.5025,5.2504,0.0254,0.3987,2.8455,2.0984,0.2374,2.6972,3.4601,0.2757,5.3409,0.0479,2.6286,1.151,3.0397,4.9249,1.1514,2.9085,0.2586,1.0381,0.6657,1.2265,2.4115,0.0531,0.0221,4.7051,0.7526,3.4933,0.7332,2.5291,4.4048,0.8464,0.4186,0.373,0.4326,0.0003,4.9146,5.487,5.3704,3.2447,1.66,0.8291,4.9314,3.2155,0.0337,3.7927,0.0838,1.7118,1.8496,4.1773,0.3784,0.0515,2.5887,1.7438,3.9481,2.3366,1.5863,0.604,0.7226,2.5296,5.5234,0.011,5.5914,1.0893,1.5081,5.1475,5.0895,0.0009,2.2146,3.1538,0.8655,5.9093,0.0033,0.5024,1.1126,0.0981,3.1388,0.6677,1.7951,0.1397,5.1421,1.0596,0.6277,4.9636,4.1088,2.6092,0.9718,1.0991,0.5598,0.0002,1.3538,2.8952,3.8299,0.1027,0.1389,0.3841,1.7353,2.6763,0.0003,0.8663,0.0675,5.0038,1.9467,2.6323,3.6466,1.0153,3.5139,0.0414,2.5795,1.9233,1.4285,5.8009,0.0017,1.7126,0.0905,1.4477,1.2382,4.5202,0.1177,0.0503,5.5005,4.5653,1.5385,4.4968,4.6189,1.6332,2.0864,0.0019,0.002,0.0631,3.1735,0.2821,0.6763,0.4588,1.1516,0.2478,0.0084,3.8881,6.2878,3.1336,5.9913,0.037,3.2258,0.001,3.3041,0.7519,0.5426,1.2141,0.0001,1.4757,3.8252,0.6603,4.2649,3.8196,2.0959,5.2536,2.1547,2.9987,3.9926,2.3989,1.7703,0.0479,2.8982,4.881,2.5948,3.7513,5.6652,4.4999,5.4143,1.5533,2.5187,1.7338,1.1723,1.3871,5.4481,1.222,3.9129,6.0453,2.4999,5.4567,4.5848,1.2783,4.1959,0.2867,4.4143,2.8313,2.4543,0.1243,0.0232,0.9201,0.2825,0.0002,3.3952,4.4266,0.6431,0.2329,2.2457,0.6201,1.6745,0.149,1.5708,4.6466,0.1317,4.8624,1.0892,1.0165,3.8425,0.1899,5.2332,5.1034,4.769,2.3167,1.5176,1.1671,3.647,2.0774,1.6402,3.9917,3.9795,2.0826,3.4937,5.8244,0.0489,1.3453,4.3146,0.9755,1.1531,0.0002,4.9509,1.8415,0.4561,0.101,0.5482,2.3738,0.082,2.5958,0.9724,0.4132,4.5286,3.0877,1.3909,0.0895,2.806,4.3893,4.3068,2.0465,5.2924,3.4369,2.8334,0.8903,1.7091,1.104,0.9207,1.69,5.2757,0.7102,5.2993,2.099,0.4455,3.6533,5.3456,0.0198,1.6265,1.3741,0.6076,0.5798,0.0002,5.7186,1.5604,1.4244,5.127,0.0292,0.3944,2.1272,3.4923,0.0469,0.9998,1.2805,0.9621,0.0129,0.0416,3.0866,0.7988,2.2161,3.0825,1.098,2.9142,0.7291,5.8436,0.1392,4.7156,1.0552,3.9227,1.8941,2.6178,0.356,0.8737,6.8688,3.348,3.1026,2.7299,1.6956,1.6934,2.0911,1.6328,3.4217,2.4899,3.1613,2.2645,2.8558,0.5406,0.2094,1.1263,2.3657,3.2457,2.0581,0.531,0.288,1.2806,0.1267,0.0002,3.2789,0.0795,0.987,0.9148,2.5561,1.7882,0.745,4.8486,2.8321,0.127,3.4058,2.9562,1.0464,5.5249,3.1965,4.3316,1.2484,1.2107,2.3839,1.1961,2.3291,2.8408,1.3214,0.8061,3.3754,1.7718,5.1479,5.5935,1.7395,3.4358,5.5565,0.2679,5.3158,4.3421,4.6015,0.0022,4.2089,4.9798,0.7121,0.2008,0.0002,0.717,3.6593,1.2028,1.1434,0.0266,2.6329,1.0823,4.2244,0.4812,1.9183,1.7643,0.0998,0.0332,3.5824,0.6068,0.9126,4.2033,8.0118,1.5977,0.9724,2.7774,1.4828,1.5615,0.3741,0.0093,0.1956,7.2032,4.5661,1.0402,2.2654,3.9322,0.0455,1.3415,1.808,4.7522,3.3063,3.2732,2.4235,5.2495,0.7986,0.3047,0.0422,0.0345,1.3185,5.2779,7.2032,2.501,0.7795,2.6576,2.303,0.0005,2.3989,0.17,3.8985,3.6654,2.8969,3.1288,1.8089,2.4847,1.9679,1.1617]}

You can't do it like that...\n\n10:00am: I knew we were gonna keep the idea in the script, but I hadn't expected that from you. You didn't make it right or wrong before so I had to make my decision.\n\n10:05am: I still hope you're not getting it right but you're the new kid, you have a bunch of new ideas, you've got some of the stuff you've never seen before but for now I think it's time with your movie. Can you come to please your fans now?\n\n10:06am: Your screenplay is the same as your film, it's just less technical. But for now I really hope that you can help me build my own movie. It's gonna be beautiful. And we have to say thank you, so much of the money won't go towards the production, the production fee.\n\n10:09am: You should have already set a budget so you can produce your own film when it becomes available. I'm already looking for more help through the forums so I'd love to see your work in the cinema now.\n\n10:10am: How much money are you doing right now?\n\n10:12am: We're at over a year old film making. We've always loved horror and we don't have time to work on our own. We just want to make something unique for our fans that will get them hooked and I can't wait to start work on our next project. So this is a very exciting thing. One that we're all in very excited about and that I am glad we're getting this done. But I'm always a believer that we need time so for now maybe we will work on something. The only thing that will come back to haunt me when it happens is that this is an extremely special thing that makes me want to continue making films, it makes me want to see more.\n\n10:12am: My dream is just make something I am passionate about and I wish you a very happy working life.

{"id":4156,"ended":false,"length":505,"gen_text":"A major historical villain wasn't evil, he was well meaning but supremely incompetent, and a comedy of errors and bungling led to the outcome of all his other crimes.\n\nNorman was in the thick of it and, though the man who worked for him did have a reputation for being a great leader and shrewd strategist, he was also a poor man's Nietzsche, a complete idiot and an ignorant.\n\nHe was also of age before his first and thus the strongest example of this trope, and most often he was still young enough to have seen it happen, and his arrogance was actually quite obvious. His lack of leadership was a reflection of his lack of a sense of good will, and would actually cause him to feel that he would be held up as a god if he didn't do his best. As a result more and more people assumed the same and he became more successful with little effort and even more useless as a demigod, often a fool or even a criminal. It was never an option however until the final act where he tried to save some of the innocents.\n\nCompare and contrast the idea of evil being evil and good having no good intentions towards anyone and just having no one to blame but oneself for their actions (in this case, a demon) where Evil is one of the defining issues of the comic. (One example where the man may think evil is good, while Evil is just an evil idea is this strip: This is the difference between a Christian and a Jew: The two are sinners, and that the good person is the moral arbiter of sin, while the evil person will only be a victim if evil is an option; it's a contradiction, then.)\n\nExamples:\n\nopen\/close all folders\n\nAnime and Manga\n\nComic Books\n\nThe X-Men: Cyclops (2009). The Cyclops: One man's genius. He will be great at anything; for sure, everyone will be great at almost anything.\n\nThe Wolverine Trilogy, Wolverine with The Apocalypse, Wolverine with The Beast, Wolverine for the Justice League: The First Apocalypse; and, in one of the final scenes of The X-Files, The Hulk and The Hulk have a moment with The Hulk, Wolverine is about as selfless as you can get, but he does a lot worse. That is, he will also be a bit selfish in battle, if the world's worst villains ever came to blows. The Hulk is more clever than Wolverine, but he isn't always quite, and he is always an utter disappointment to people who believe he knows who they really are.\n\nWestern Animation\n\nReal Life","token_len":544,"entropy":[7.8995,8.2359,9.4957,7.9193,0.0007,7.7858,1.0361,2.7626,0.2396,7.5143,6.4466,4.4658,9.3105,0.0741,4.4948,2.1594,1.5509,3.7658,9.1808,2.6092,5.2848,1.3379,6.4796,0.5017,5.4103,0.5119,1.9605,7.3106,0.6494,5.2095,2.961,5.1438,2.8101,0.351,1.5472,0.0431,6.0174,2.7292,3.4339,4.9625,1.9573,5.6121,0.0089,0.739,2.8434,3.3099,4.3429,3.0612,5.7784,2.9105,5.6532,1.7098,0.712,4.1204,4.0202,1.131,2.9803,0.6456,1.5993,1.5787,3.6249,4.7074,2.0046,4.9032,0.043,3.6327,0.1411,0.6481,1.0185,2.1066,1.3534,5.6371,1.1514,0.0996,6.178,2.1029,1.2511,5.8175,2.907,1.4306,2.4763,4.7029,6.1072,1.5035,0.0002,2.6067,1.0747,2.1372,6.0153,5.8137,6.0985,2.5233,4.1566,5.3169,6.8836,2.7731,5.7653,5.6096,0.2654,3.3611,3.6644,2.1436,1.9073,5.3132,3.5296,3.353,0.481,5.1796,2.4663,2.937,0.302,2.3234,3.8789,3.4668,3.6795,1.7152,2.2445,3.5646,5.1534,1.6052,5.5408,1.6266,4.2731,0.7618,3.9692,4.821,0.0053,4.4106,1.5446,2.3312,5.1468,0.091,0.5395,2.5888,0.0029,4.1427,1.5818,0.0206,4.7126,2.7902,1.0922,1.1751,5.9718,5.7922,2.9532,1.0931,0.5714,4.0604,3.6507,0.902,3.9451,1.3498,5.0978,3.5606,0.5896,0.8138,4.7038,3.1299,0.351,1.616,0.0006,2.2397,2.0901,2.7151,0.9553,4.6239,1.4905,0.3866,8.4682,1.0363,0.0018,1.1505,3.9804,3.2369,3.4228,3.7324,2.8326,1.4474,2.617,5.5764,4.1654,5.7825,2.8548,2.2399,4.3028,1.984,5.8514,3.0595,0.7749,6.2887,0.4637,0.0089,2.2888,4.0186,4.6916,3.7474,2.6518,2.2655,0.6281,3.9922,0.378,4.1811,0.8626,5.3807,4.0806,3.7527,6.672,5.7523,1.7652,3.6855,2.5891,1.8278,0.8843,4.9101,0.2797,3.8662,5.0618,1.3405,1.0283,4.9907,0.0014,2.9183,0.6729,0.0002,3.4423,2.312,0.0633,2.4727,5.5385,0.4557,4.106,1.8559,3.5846,1.9627,3.1214,4.8161,2.7044,3.6148,2.1913,5.4714,2.2718,2.4076,4.595,3.088,2.5956,4.3465,0.7279,0.3749,1.027,2.4385,2.6265,2.0191,1.094,3.9328,3.6956,1.7241,0.1555,0.8468,3.0766,5.2064,1.8456,6.8596,5.3972,1.38,5.264,1.3077,0.711,5.2559,6.4426,0.7841,0.7711,3.9665,0.9153,5.9826,4.4841,2.8967,3.5878,2.0133,5.3421,5.4587,4.5133,3.892,0.6811,1.3138,1.8225,3.3118,2.2573,0.5457,3.5448,3.5254,1.7591,3.7943,2.3929,4.9862,5.7912,3.3939,6.0749,1.1259,1.8913,5.8818,0.1066,2.0689,5.8427,0.4325,0.3807,2.3206,2.6776,2.0836,3.9188,1.2445,4.6019,1.3168,1.4662,4.757,3.0405,4.4881,2.5474,1.2432,2.0625,5.3698,3.7548,0.035,0.7933,4.4723,1.8793,1.7981,0.2308,1.2387,0.1031,5.3939,3.6823,1.7462,2.5967,4.2994,2.346,4.2878,0.7081,4.2126,4.3775,4.2708,3.6107,1.2045,2.1377,5.3527,1.6887,5.4055,1.3248,0.67,0.0003,0.6041,0.1988,0.0352,0.0002,0.0034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0041,0.0003,0.2197,0.0005,0.9559,0.0007,0.004,0.0003,0.3281,0.0679,0.0767,0.0037,0.0002,2.932,5.012,0.0859,0.1978,1.5853,3.2123,0.0046,3.8379,4.8146,3.2548,2.6099,1.9797,0.0037,5.4599,4.4878,4.8317,1.3231,4.8914,2.9565,2.9443,5.0907,3.8447,4.5379,2.3577,1.7148,4.8624,5.28,4.0593,0.6421,6.0328,1.6245,1.0963,0.863,0.3328,6.6064,0.1437,0.6487,1.4227,0.0004,1.6683,3.8364,5.6477,2.9701,3.6258,5.5997,4.5863,5.5183,1.7028,1.3809,1.1577,1.945,5.0197,0.7737,0.5072,4.7706,1.7179,4.8142,0.0802,3.4719,1.9838,4.8456,3.7058,4.9445,2.9321,3.6073,2.6232,3.0405,1.0174,0.6475,3.697,2.6339,1.0776,2.2218,2.5476,0.0077,3.2774,0.4905,2.9807,4.7299,2.9851,1.358,0.718,3.1343,1.0613,3.9014,4.2418,1.8742,0.7844,1.7153,5.286,3.3147,3.9899,3.8935,5.6669,1.3581,0.4081,2.0657,0.5084,0.2819,1.6971,2.3449,1.6167,3.407,3.4746,1.6792,2.2694,1.9751,5.4462,2.4439,1.2817,1.1448,3.0597,5.4983,1.5414,2.0337,3.7147,2.3487,2.7441,5.9898,1.1241,4.6047,3.6707,4.1131,3.5868,4.2732,1.9255,3.1404,3.7661,1.2512,2.6094,0.7488,3.5095,1.0877,1.6912,3.3946,5.9711,1.1807,2.1129,0.7611,1.0813,1.4358,4.8039,0.0007,3.4673,4.6907,7.1036,1.4798,1.5191,1.9874,3.235,4.724,4.7667,5.0249,0.9731,3.8358,1.3714,4.1595,1.8311,5.339,4.6152,2.4794,2.6438,0.0817,0.4375,0.6975,0.0005,4.2095,0.0098,0.6179,0.0004,1.3827,0.0372]}
{"id":1326,"ended":true,"length":507,"gen_text":"You are a great and powerful wizard. Unfortunately, you have a tendency for sleepwalking... and sleep-spellcasting.\n\nIt was only a year ago that I wrote a short story about how I got married. In short, I did everything I knew to make love, and to be a good couple. I did everything but married people with that.\n\nI was lucky to have all this good and loving love in my life -- no matter what the situation might have been. No matter what other people could do to make it better for myself or my family -- no matter what other people could do to make it better for me or my family.\n\nBut I've done it with a lot of bad things:\n\nIt made love last... a lot more difficult than I thought it would be.\n\nThe second marriage seemed an easy choice. There were really no great surprises when the new man and lady had left, so there was no need to get the deal done.\n\nThe relationship seemed very much like it had ended. It felt like a good bet for me and I to eventually become a good couple.\n\nYou know what, it does not feel that good. No, I'm not even going to argue against the fact that it has, which is so important right now.\n\nThe other thing...\n\nYou know, there are other things that are just as important as those things I do the same thing over and over again.\n\nI've always loved this life.... even now, when you come out, it feels like you are getting the very best from your life.\n\nNow, the more important things are you, and your relationships... but that time is over...\n\nThe very idea of being loved in that relationship is extremely precious and incredibly valuable. No matter what you decide to do or say, there is always a chance that I'll love it out anyway.\n\nYou know what, when you are ready, you won't let that happen.\n\nThat is when your life, your life... is over... the only way you can turn that into a better time for you is to do it.\n\nIf you have tried my life, you know what is just one more step to your life... you are just a step farther now... but...\n\nIn the end, I'm not going to give up.\n\nDo you think I would even bother writing about this? Please let me know - it was worth seeing if it inspired you to love us back and be happier with us... and have the right skills to make it a better place for you and us... well done... thank you so much.","token_len":545,"entropy":[3.8827,2.7333,5.5446,4.7589,4.8008,4.924,1.6158,6.3954,0.349,1.249,1.6817,2.3156,4.3643,4.6893,8.9375,2.3411,5.1188,2.3976,5.4421,4.3001,12.4628,2.6052,0.5931,2.4067,0.026,4.8294,3.8773,2.9838,1.6428,4.0383,0.3958,0.5175,0.9283,4.6843,1.0087,3.0378,1.0934,1.1496,2.5895,1.1157,3.2049,4.6573,1.2736,3.4727,5.7792,0.1976,0.8433,4.5578,3.425,0.8246,5.468,1.8075,2.124,4.713,2.6477,1.4054,3.2451,3.219,2.1144,1.2823,4.4786,0.3255,1.5278,3.4034,1.2804,5.3702,5.4799,4.6163,5.1375,5.8693,4.8252,1.5156,0.0004,1.6775,2.6718,3.5024,1.7111,0.9096,4.5634,3.2699,4.7716,4.1067,2.9165,2.2724,2.0898,1.1162,0.9686,5.7559,5.1086,0.8761,1.0878,2.8544,2.4631,4.15,2.1236,0.0286,0.4201,4.7645,0.2307,0.6798,4.8543,0.8455,4.5172,3.0061,1.0466,2.008,2.108,1.4013,1.4229,4.661,1.4929,0.9658,0.9439,4.1095,1.7027,0.0062,0.5602,2.3559,0.2696,0.5358,0.2914,0.2226,0.5516,0.495,0.5711,0.0274,1.0405,0.6153,0.0869,0.34,0.9494,0.7728,0.0001,2.8431,1.5241,3.747,4.5137,1.901,3.3069,1.7083,1.9386,0.3662,3.2959,2.8549,4.1878,2.0855,0.0001,4.5404,4.5744,5.1663,5.405,5.216,4.2928,1.4216,3.9153,4.2533,1.7388,1.0879,1.1659,0.7516,0.1729,0.4229,0.2812,0.9053,0.0001,3.8811,5.492,4.994,5.6228,5.1981,2.8332,2.2913,0.8617,4.8967,1.1452,6.3129,1.217,5.37,5.1303,3.5911,2.8521,4.3665,2.6742,2.4997,5.3454,3.8531,5.5405,2.875,2.0011,3.3402,0.3965,0.7753,2.413,0.4779,4.2302,4.2504,5.0289,0.5147,0.3567,0.6625,0.0002,2.0827,5.1295,2.97,4.2056,3.0769,1.2914,2.0894,1.4186,3.997,1.0593,2.8393,3.0054,0.667,1.9457,4.337,3.7835,2.7966,1.0503,2.4104,3.9865,4.4363,5.0168,4.5293,1.3191,1.7499,0.2137,0.3896,0.6357,0.0002,5.0328,2.4655,1.2912,2.3323,2.5638,5.5888,2.263,2.589,2.2807,1.9351,0.9168,4.2148,1.6466,1.685,2.1046,0.6393,4.0729,1.8933,0.0329,3.6185,5.2474,2.362,1.0111,0.0836,1.1753,3.5841,4.4376,5.8534,0.3541,5.8745,2.0786,5.9304,0.0487,0.3477,1.077,0.0002,2.933,3.8844,0.9705,5.8807,2.2975,0.0002,3.053,1.0426,1.665,3.4461,1.3667,3.4365,0.8507,0.9045,2.6052,3.6523,1.2824,0.2814,1.462,4.6997,1.7047,3.1913,3.0005,6.5617,3.1931,1.1632,2.6121,0.0558,0.0014,0.5541,0.3668,0.7228,0.0001,1.664,2.5397,2.8148,3.2869,3.8931,3.303,8.2874,4.1156,4.1464,1.5654,2.5802,3.9039,4.5789,2.5283,1.6416,1.9015,1.6768,0.6839,1.456,2.3012,4.0546,3.2376,5.159,0.2123,3.2201,2.5626,1.017,0.4736,0.5158,0.0001,4.6398,0.5697,3.7328,4.1374,2.8495,1.1873,1.3316,4.3458,2.436,1.56,2.0998,3.542,3.5711,4.4762,3.1159,6.659,1.235,2.0267,3.3891,1.6045,0.0002,2.8995,5.3289,4.1318,0.5117,2.0958,5.0161,3.3158,3.6277,3.8473,1.1183,5.4269,5.5074,2.3417,4.5695,3.5027,0.6053,5.2674,0.7964,0.6534,2.0465,3.948,0.4578,0.0533,2.7432,1.2091,0.6511,3.3764,0.7041,1.1911,1.5468,1.1159,0.8008,4.6305,2.2082,4.1853,4.535,5.3029,6.7515,0.3206,0.3081,0.0002,2.9333,1.0681,0.6349,1.0882,3.5301,0.8373,2.4917,2.8749,1.5708,1.0436,4.818,0.0068,4.3859,1.9759,0.8973,0.7848,0.9503,0.0002,3.8165,1.7308,3.8867,3.3333,2.0998,4.5824,1.2236,1.3544,3.892,1.8982,1.824,2.412,5.2325,3.3458,1.3536,1.2208,0.8942,5.9024,2.0064,3.1341,1.0773,2.7212,4.9384,1.1312,0.2081,1.1639,0.8882,3.7704,1.8009,1.2903,0.2475,0.0002,3.3972,0.3999,2.9201,5.0245,5.4948,3.1722,0.9736,1.245,0.9191,1.4288,4.8827,4.7731,5.4878,2.1298,1.8933,2.1117,3.8678,1.4512,2.2914,3.541,2.6112,4.0408,2.6953,1.8983,5.2065,5.4321,2.3227,4.0089,4.472,1.1567,0.0002,5.1576,1.451,0.9606,0.2964,1.6381,2.2398,2.3538,1.6081,0.0473,2.9348,0.3053,1.4014,0.9598,0.0003,5.6382,0.7623,2.1429,1.2306,3.3394,4.7883,5.3182,3.6284,1.4285,1.286,1.519,4.5794,2.7128,0.0773,0.0268,5.7107,2.8805,3.8097,3.1375,7.2651,4.5073,2.1238,5.6367,0.306,1.0941,4.8417,6.0506,4.3713,3.4801,4.0919,4.8636,1.8498,1.3083,3.4864,2.009,5.6422,3.4164,5.0566,6.4111,1.0076,1.6519,1.5566,2.1906,1.3183,1.4997,0.9022,0.2551,1.6201,2.1438,2.2691,6.2078,3.115,3.0569,4.5724,0.0122,2.4562,0.0446,1.6765]}

They ask you to recount your first kill....and 't' that in the coming days they will be able to prove to you what happened in 'those days' and tell you anything you want to know about the case in the time it took you to come into contact with it.\"\n\nThe police described the suspect as black male and had hair cut to a slim waist in an apparent effort to avoid detection.\n\nMr Cameron called it \"a matter of deep concern\".\n\nHe added: \"People will need to make difficult choices about the legalisation of child sexual exploitation but for now we are having to do with making those choices on what we want our children to do.\n\n\"You have been caught up in another trial, and it is too late to do anything about them, but it would really help us to stop and stop the 'child sexual exploitation' that we have so often been accused of.\n\n\"If things got out of control, it wouldn't make any difference, but I know you have to make a decision for your children on what they want to

children at \"high risk\" by implementing safeguards designed to prevent those who work in the sector from engaging in child sex trade.\n\nUnder the proposals, the Department for Exiting the European

statistics don't include the young people employed at the company, the report indicates that over a quarter of staff have been victims of sexual exploitation.\n\nAccording to the report: \"By 2014 more than \u00a3700m would have been saved had the law been in place in 1995, an increase of 28 per cent, and nearly 80 per cent of profits generated through the sector from trafficking in children

It turns out that I can also call this on the first argument from the third argument.\n\nNext up, you can use a variable (in this case, a variable defined in the variable declaration) to set the parameters, which will set the value of the callable:\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 $(str \"Hello \" + str(string))\n\nThis gets the parameter value (the two arguments):\n\n1 2 3 4 5 #ifdef STD_CALLABLE 1 2 3 4 5 #endif \/* STD_CALLABLE if ([i, j] == null || [j, x] == null); then return {callCallable};} return null; }\n\nI also added the call callback parameter to this function:\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 function call_callable(int i) { return i; }\n\nOK, it's finally done. So when you are ready, you can start writing code using function calls:\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 function use_dialogue(int i) { var new_dialogue = make_dialogue(); new_dialogue = function() { return new_dialogue(); } try { \/\/ do this in your document now for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++ ) { \/\/ now we want our screen to be \"green\" text. textBox.text = \"Good morning, dear friend! My name is: Bill.\"; textBox.size.add(i); } catch (e) { if (!str(new_dialogue.text)) cout << \"Call: \" << e.getText(); else } }\n\nHere is a test code:","token_len":548,"entropy":[4.0641,9.7285,5.4728,2.836,4.8644,1.2124,3.4684,0.3732,4.0609,1.6256,2.5801,1.892,0.0044,5.1824,0.7228,2.2359,0.2062,1.0257,1.8603,1.038,1.1025,3.5519,2.4329,1.3584,3.4849,0.2608,1.1188,0.1679,0.0002,2.9366,0.3601,0.046,0.0526,0.0454,0.0499,0.0714,0.04,0.0512,0.055,0.0474,0.044,0.0907,8.2458,0.3845,0.131,0.0495,0.0648,0.0704,0.0707,0.0433,0.0876,0.0592,0.0716,0.0889,0.0661,0.0878,0.0786,0.0857,6.7459,4.785,4.2696,3.0873,0.1086,3.1327,0.2507,6.8734,0.519,1.8565,0.0255,0.1886,4.0092,0.0673,0.6758,1.3045,0.0221,0.0479,2.4894,2.6127,5.6888,4.2722,0.1438,1.8878,0.2932,2.7748,4.4946,0.3449,0.2028,4.7135,1.5118,1.8122,0.0343,3.0927,0.071,0.0647,2.8437,5.712,0.1109,5.5884,4.749,5.0619,0.271,1.427,1.2317,0.2361,1.1844,0.0002,4.0853,4.2321,1.6781,2.2643,0.0422,1.6057,2.0646,2.6024,0.0089,1.8065,2.122,2.5815,1.9078,4.7576,1.2362,4.6038,3.3944,3.5141,2.536,0.0895,0.0001,0.3046,0.0596,0.0293,0.0585,0.0316,0.0398,9.1362,5.2107,4.0777,1.7482,3.456,1.5812,0.4012,1.779,4.6176,2.3897,1.0512,0.0003,3.4991,2.5301,2.158,2.9107,1.4389,2.2653,1.3752,1.5786,5.1915,6.4912,2.8342,1.3588,0.0784,0.0001,0.1061,0.0523,0.0548,0.0721,0.0524,0.1377,2.9441,5.0726,0.5101,1.4308,0.0002,2.9362,3.2229,1.5739,5.0424,1.4952,6.6647,1.4806,0.0346,4.4368,0.8545,3.5619,3.0787,2.8629,0.6376,1.2134,0.4556,3.5103,1.2374,3.6409,0.8971,1.9405,2.7233,1.2553,1.3865,3.6631,5.6768,0.011,0.6066,2.103,1.5095,3.8932,1.5634,3.393,2.5581,0.6779,0.4556,0.2102,5.6816,1.7484,5.4889,0.1645,1.8088,0.9996,0.0001,5.8344,2.6183,0.9277,4.0293,1.1327,1.5521,1.8951,5.6772,4.697,3.7434,0.7923,0.0649,1.5033,2.1888,2.4485,5.1352,0.8937,1.3695,3.9226,2.3456,0.8355,0.4025,3.6363,1.1489,2.6612,3.8645,2.8205,2.3688,4.2523,0.5075,2.7778,0.3561,0.5092,2.513,0.0638,2.2827,0.0219,0.0001,0.0492,0.0451,0.0374,0.0746,0.0881,0.1594,2.6012,1.3457,0.3856,0.338,0.2625,0.0203,0.0325,0.0161,0.9452,0.1939,0.265,0.0002,2.2883,5.5113,1.9973,4.1152,2.6475,3.6079,2.717,6.1997,1.3092,4.2313,0.081,0.0001,0.079,0.0416,0.0289,0.0463,0.075,6.7477,4.9065,0.5189,8.2263,2.3324,4.4797,0.9727,3.404,2.5299,0.0708,0.0939,0.1906,0.2467,2.7705,0.3825,3.7397,3.9418,0.0321,0.0792,0.0002,0.0071,6.251,6.7683,5.1666,2.8987,1.6545,0.8712,0.5163,3.2086,1.9832,1.3116,1.6635,0.6622,4.5772,0.2307,0.1258,0.1168,3.8792,0.7244,2.4911,3.7483,4.0308,5.7575,0.0455,2.8529,4.3309,4.4311,4.2512,0.7412,0.5303,0.4521,0.0001,2.7438,3.4003,2.2835,2.1424,2.0886,4.0833,3.7038,0.9426,3.7453,0.9047,1.672,0.0677,0.0001,0.068,0.0565,0.0587,0.0965,0.1428,0.3397,0.6829,4.5617,1.0607,4.5103,1.041,1.6881,1.3254,3.1305,0.6842,1.3136,0.031,1.0631,1.8882,1.79,0.0224,0.6392,0.0001,6.2254,0.2165,4.0096,0.6986,4.1482,1.1135,0.9671,4.2717,5.1674,1.3316,3.7555,1.3896,2.9769,1.1,0.3349,3.5012,2.7496,1.7055,3.086,6.2662,0.86,1.9339,0.104,0.0001,0.1314,0.075,0.0595,0.1089,0.2265,0.3472,0.2213,2.0061,5.4421,0.8929,6.5436,2.2116,0.4151,1.1201,1.0579,0.2832,0.012,2.716,4.7015,1.5447,0.3537,0.0311,0.1909,6.305,0.1602,0.5807,0.0054,2.0479,1.6477,0.0023,0.0104,0.0098,1.7561,2.5177,1.2994,0.0091,1.3648,0.8495,0.0076,0.0074,0.0018,2.5801,1.1012,6.6903,0.029,3.1084,4.1251,2.3688,3.4239,2.9221,5.7458,5.7207,4.6933,0.3178,0.4844,0.1688,0.1133,0.1661,0.0226,0.005,0.0228,2.3551,0.0449,0.0092,1.6654,0.0914,0.0562,1.7214,4.9323,1.7394,3.0119,3.196,5.1176,0.595,1.1099,5.2463,5.6795,0.2025,4.1947,2.867,3.1202,3.5319,0.893,2.5583,0.8296,1.3737,5.4611,1.8376,1.5061,5.0915,1.9346,2.0198,4.8908,0.0673,0.078,5.5743,6.0925,3.1621,0.2489,0.9648,0.1546,0.1194,4.2774,3.2092,4.3491,0.4403,3.2281,0.1509,1.1567,0.1876,0.1126,0.7281,0.1095,0.0257,4.0653,1.5577,5.1887,1.5042,0.7151,0.0014,0.0006,0.0052,2.0597,1.4921,0.2899,7.4076,0.0138,0.3893,5.8013,3.0938,0.6454,0.2204,1.5145,0.6871,2.4714,3.2216,0.7721,2.8731,2.9281,0.8833,1.191,0.0001,3.2492,0.9304,1.555,4.2374,3.2112,2.1437]}
{"id":3666,"ended":true,"length":464,"gen_text":"Write a Lovecraftian horror story where YOU, writing the story, are the incomprehensible cosmic horror tormenting the protagonists.\n\n. The protagonist in the story will kill you, and the other characters will simply kill you. In short: you are the Lovecraftian horror tormentor, and you are the nightmare.\n\nThis could also hold true with those stories where your brain was wired to think things through and make decisions based on the information provided in the text.\n\nA Lovecraftian horror tale that can give you what you're looking for might be something like The Wizard of Oz. Or Star Trek. There are a ton of classic films and TV shows for which you can read books about Lovecraftian horror. Lovecraft's stories include stories such as:\n\n\"The Man Who Fell to Earth\" by R.J. Rignot\n\n\"The Great Mystery of the Green River\" by Edward Carpenter and J.E. Reitman\n\n\"The Legend of the King\" by Robert E. Howard\n\n\"Hannibal\" by R. Frank Green\n\n\"Ghost in the Shell\" by James Cameron\n\n\"The Wolf of Wall Street\" by Robert E. Howard\n\n\"The Thing From South Park\" by Edgar Cayce\n\n\"The Returned\" by Robert E. Howard\n\n\"The Wild Hunt\" by Alfred Hitchcock\n\n\"Pulp Fiction\" by Philip K. Dick\n\n\"The Haunting\" by William Faulkner.\n\n\"Night of the Living Dead\" by Edward M. O'Brien.\n\n\"Wish And Scream\" by Stephen King.\n\nWe have a lot of amazing horror stories, but only a fair amount of this stuff should be on any Lovecraftian horror anthology. Don't worry folks, Lovecraft is not dead and that's okay because:\n\nThere are always some strange creatures lurking behind the scenes\n\nThe Lovecraftian Horror Mythos don't work\n\nMost weird creatures are just good kids trying to impress their teachers\n\nThe story will tell of people living in the distant past, or not even living on Earth. Don't worry the big scary monsters and supernatural beings have been dead for decades. The only scary thing happening now is the ones waiting for you: The new horror series is just one of the things we should be talking about today.\n\nThe list goes on and on but I am now really excited to see more Lovecraftian horror. As a community we should be supporting them as hard as we can.\n\nThank you to everyone who has reached out by e-mail and written comments on this post, and thank you more for reading. I appreciate you all my life.","token_len":548,"entropy":[4.0641,13.4861,1.0441,5.6278,1.2135,5.098,7.9779,4.0157,8.9618,1.8983,0.7988,0.3739,1.8655,1.3158,12.3327,6.9969,3.8894,9.4375,0.9846,1.5,6.809,0.7023,1.605,0.0139,7.1175,3.7123,4.121,4.8831,1.6928,0.4185,2.3479,5.801,1.3598,1.8975,1.8132,2.1801,3.4311,0.8952,0.4167,5.2234,2.9937,0.279,0.5614,4.0049,4.4611,2.4366,2.4564,1.5494,1.4273,4.2975,0.1507,1.2982,1.0133,1.3163,1.6511,1.0652,1.339,0.9902,1.0973,6.0606,1.6515,0.7042,0.0002,3.706,5.6162,2.7978,6.1245,0.5297,3.3244,6.0935,2.8411,1.0267,3.4798,5.5802,3.8237,4.1762,0.798,2.3671,5.0617,1.2347,2.4186,3.6888,1.3848,1.8201,0.1355,1.8158,3.2164,4.081,3.0329,0.4755,4.8699,0.5099,1.4988,0.0003,4.1022,2.7068,0.1003,0.9516,3.0951,3.1155,3.8871,5.9336,0.9111,5.8961,0.5873,3.5169,0.3526,0.0191,4.5571,1.0641,3.2765,0.41,3.1574,5.2031,0.2001,0.1015,1.5222,2.6118,5.7668,1.1943,0.7053,6.1912,1.075,2.4185,3.2327,0.0574,5.465,4.6809,1.7431,0.9285,0.1707,5.4123,2.204,1.8097,1.0313,3.172,4.525,2.1068,2.3677,1.2713,0.9848,0.9652,5.0985,2.084,1.4447,5.4857,4.1638,2.765,0.0027,3.5914,0.819,0.0002,3.9748,1.1131,4.2869,0.6415,3.1445,0.8416,0.045,0.3614,1.0986,5.5956,0.2769,2.4029,0.0406,2.0325,4.1294,0.4355,0.7836,0.0002,0.2085,0.8095,4.8863,4.8162,0.2755,1.0298,5.7293,4.9201,0.179,0.0217,5.2369,4.721,3.8019,4.199,0.0875,4.1407,0.0073,5.784,4.8235,0.1277,0.1002,0.0003,0.2625,0.6571,5.8107,0.0317,1.5737,5.7472,1.9798,0.0252,3.0628,1.9289,0.0297,0.0633,0.3534,0.0004,0.4113,4.366,2.9746,0.002,0.8771,0.0403,4.6741,0.1019,6.2141,6.0607,0.442,0.0003,0.4446,6.1227,2.2945,0.0376,0.4761,0.1412,0.0364,4.3172,1.9193,0.2782,0.0003,0.4456,1.0643,5.3885,0.5022,0.0251,0.0258,0.0366,0.0118,2.8339,2.1006,0.0056,0.0468,0.1693,0.0004,0.6599,0.9569,3.8508,3.935,6.3403,0.67,0.022,0.0045,5.1027,5.1103,0.0008,0.2047,0.0003,0.6081,0.936,5.6615,4.5522,0.1117,0.0056,2.5219,0.6898,0.0026,0.0152,0.128,0.0003,0.6737,0.9303,5.4046,2.5112,0.0531,0.0045,4.241,0.1886,0.0945,0.0003,0.4764,4.9672,1.5857,0.0007,0.1618,0.0298,4.3581,0.266,0.1931,0.0001,0.0871,0.0003,0.5922,0.9838,5.2677,0.2248,1.8725,0.0093,3.23,2.1068,0.0006,0.0001,5.3849,0.3179,0.0002,1.7872,4.8459,1.732,0.0154,0.1518,0.0112,0.028,0.0341,5.2719,3.7757,0.0923,5.3061,0.6049,1.1217,1.3826,0.211,0.0002,1.0694,4.9812,4.4831,5.404,4.1033,0.0623,0.0321,3.7219,0.1277,0.6385,0.141,0.0002,5.2346,2.9649,2.0772,1.3849,0.6027,5.4272,2.3143,0.3196,2.6414,1.3588,4.0089,1.0649,6.018,0.7782,0.2741,5.7528,1.6878,4.7325,0.587,4.0297,3.7663,2.8532,0.1858,0.6568,2.2061,0.449,4.9884,0.0013,2.7221,5.7335,0.576,3.5566,1.3241,2.002,3.6528,2.9792,2.862,0.7782,2.2375,3.0152,6.1716,0.292,0.0002,3.4161,0.6727,4.9105,2.7135,5.9835,3.2196,0.6461,4.2965,0.6954,2.2787,3.1921,0.0002,2.2243,3.4978,0.111,1.8925,4.5492,0.1946,5.5213,0.0033,5.294,2.1884,0.0003,4.7648,6.3193,3.2463,1.6342,2.877,5.641,5.3263,4.1108,0.0831,4.4686,1.2614,3.6813,0.4821,0.0002,2.0313,4.4071,3.8006,3.8169,4.0845,3.9716,4.136,0.554,1.8882,5.2497,0.488,1.751,2.6512,4.919,2.8256,2.6976,4.3617,1.3567,2.7974,5.256,0.0004,1.3711,5.2969,5.7709,2.0244,2.2561,3.4649,4.502,2.0375,4.1669,2.4243,5.186,0.3122,3.8326,1.3294,2.9075,3.2525,3.4255,1.3315,4.7995,1.676,0.1742,1.7695,5.3212,6.2127,1.1581,1.1819,5.458,3.417,5.7007,3.4346,3.7443,2.6283,3.7876,5.4021,1.3972,1.3928,2.6529,2.3309,3.9151,0.7437,3.9209,0.0051,4.5698,0.3457,0.6452,0.0003,2.7657,4.8219,1.1658,0.0212,0.4523,0.0125,4.1433,2.6258,3.2913,6.0641,5.1194,2.6571,1.104,2.2576,3.4373,1.5723,0.1268,0.2871,2.3554,4.2943,2.1467,5.5772,1.0376,1.6604,0.8593,5.5231,5.233,3.0525,4.1892,0.0482,0.2921,0.0784,0.7701,1.7548,0.0003,4.2665,0.0267,2.1777,1.721,0.339,1.0181,5.6486,0.0336,6.1083,2.7302,0.0041,0.0022,2.3388,4.2807,4.2991,1.245,1.0407,1.0376,2.6462,1.4442,3.2779,0.0255,7.4406,1.3682,1.3449,0.8992,2.2727,4.176,2.1271,1.3325,5.8678,1.8543,0.9007]}
{"id":3986,"ended":false,"length":526,"gen_text":"A man is suicidal and happened to be held at gunpoint. He does not comply with the gunman's orders, as he figures this is his opportunity to get killed without having to do it himself. The gun turns out to either be fake or empty of ammunition. The victim soon decides he no longer wants to die.\n\nMr Tuck says: \" The victim was acting very badly. He was shot because he wanted to make up for his wounds. He was bleeding badly, and that's the time he said he was going into another room with another man after he lost his right hand.\n\n\"He is the only man he knows in the house that he could have shot but wanted to go away to buy something. He made out with his friend. The victim was sitting inside the living room of his mother's house and he said something to her and then suddenly she turned to him with a red face.\n\n\"The man then punched the girl. As she did that the knife struck another boy. Next he said something like this but it didn't go beyond the waistline 'cause she didn't stop fighting 'cause she was still fighting and there was a knife inside her mouth.\n\n\"The victim said that the knife was a knife he found in the room when he left the door. He said that this man then said that the knife was a weapon so he could kill himself but there was no knife in his mouth where the victim came from. When he finished, he turned so that he could stab the victim then started choking the man. At that point there was a blood clot and he had to be helped to life.\"\n\nMr Tuck says he was put on life support as he had to sit down and watch TV, but this did not stop him from making out with his friend. \"Once he reached the end, then he was left in the hospital with bleeding eyes and he was in this nightmare but somehow I know my son is not going to have this kind of nightmare.\"\n\nHe says if anyone is worried about being treated for a broken arm, or being treated for an unplanned pregnancy, they should contact the local hospital where they have been treated, or with the local Gardai, to ask them what has happened.\n\nOn Wednesday, a member of the public was left with gunshot wounds to her arm outside her home in South Dunlap, Cork.

In a normal day, there are random moments when time stops and It's starting to get on your nerves.\n\nHowever there are others with the same ability in the world and when they stop time you can still move. In a normal day, there are random moments when time stops and It's starting to get on your nerves. Your ability to move has become more important than ever before after learning and is the strongest.\n\nIt is a skill that is used primarily by people who have lost interest in their training and who already do not have the training ability to stop time (for example who can perform a simple leg workout with less muscle strength for 10 minutes or less.)\n\nTraining is the essential step in an athlete's long-term fitness. As a result more and more people are moving away from running into the gym.\n\n. In its recent history, time has been a key and important tool in increasing strength and endurance, and there are a number of studies confirming this.\n\nThe most important question for athletes who train time is what time they are in.\n\nResearch on the relationship between moving and performance shows that the most important time of the day for performance is during the very first minute of a workout where the athlete is moving. When moving slowly, which is the quickest, the only way for the athlete is for them to put their hand across the floor without making a lot of progress.\n\nThe short of it is that you must start gradually, even at the beginning. As long as you begin slowly and with the kind of intensity that can be done in the first five seconds of a workout you are able to be as intense as a marathon runner.\n\nThis kind of time for movement should be time at the beginning when the athlete is in very sharp focus on moving faster.\n\nIn most cases, running at the start time before training gives you the time you need to keep your progress over the longer periods of time.\n\nI am reminded by two people who are going through some years of training that we could be doing more than any other part of their life. We are at a point where something is wrong with our physical fitness. What if we did not have enough flexibility to run faster?\n\nThe challenge for my life now is to try and continue those steps and give them a real workout and build up my physical fitness.\n\nI am looking forward to your words.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about time zones and body movement, you can check out my work for this website.\n\nAdvertisements","token_len":550,"entropy":[3.7506,3.3197,2.6769,0.0879,6.3151,5.8835,3.9407,4.0564,1.4558,4.9785,5.6817,0.7833,5.3342,4.5406,1.9415,2.2924,1.6027,4.9384,1.7535,4.2873,2.9763,5.0329,1.7502,2.3958,0.5594,2.9664,1.2497,3.8597,3.8028,2.8024,3.7269,3.6797,4.2349,4.7403,1.7895,3.8431,1.0246,8.3252,4.7107,1.7607,3.1039,1.5469,1.9332,11.2725,1.8939,8.0702,0.4476,1.8935,6.7264,0.6684,0.0445,0.404,1.9112,0.019,4.5624,2.3562,0.1012,0.8288,0.1329,0.0047,0.0018,0.0043,0.0039,0.0013,0.0011,0.0012,0.0008,0.0043,0.0013,0.0009,0.002,0.0014,0.0014,0.0017,0.0011,0.0027,0.0014,0.0021,0.0013,0.0009,0.0004,0.0014,0.0012,0.0006,0.0026,0.0005,0.0005,0.0008,0.4067,0.0005,0.0155,0.0012,0.0031,0.001,0.0134,0.0002,0.0009,3.8001,3.8316,0.2498,2.5503,4.2159,4.5504,1.5722,2.2257,2.4461,0.685,2.2985,6.9784,4.5247,5.3952,4.6518,3.8089,5.4342,4.7085,1.4616,0.0001,2.5529,2.3472,2.9443,3.407,0.7372,2.3945,3.65,5.6118,1.0027,2.9913,0.7859,1.7501,3.912,4.0389,0.1255,3.0065,4.3726,1.5502,2.7171,5.9806,4.4191,0.1426,0.7404,0.9013,3.1652,2.6897,0.4748,2.5032,0.2586,5.6431,4.0218,0.4773,6.6064,3.8614,5.2602,1.7143,3.4415,5.9371,4.3169,2.8173,4.4689,4.6623,3.9366,4.2959,3.1263,0.5495,3.074,2.883,4.9025,0.5961,0.0002,4.9271,1.9705,2.3594,5.6847,3.2173,0.9567,4.478,2.1938,0.0931,5.8037,0.6731,0.0374,2.5847,0.8665,4.3204,2.0176,0.8149,6.2948,1.0823,0.0087,0.5897,1.0131,4.6758,3.5239,0.0078,5.4783,6.3898,1.7094,1.1523,1.5953,1.0381,0.0002,8.1245,4.203,6.1856,5.9246,2.2754,0.5583,4.5532,1.118,1.2584,2.1566,2.3527,4.6748,2.3257,3.0909,0.8897,5.2587,4.0127,0.7409,1.4835,2.6476,2.0179,4.2447,0.968,2.9853,1.0202,0.0162,3.3749,5.5911,0.9797,0.3446,1.0575,0.0002,2.3878,3.4767,2.0187,5.5494,2.758,2.1142,2.7681,2.9365,4.3199,0.8428,2.9177,2.9585,1.2108,2.4253,3.2504,1.0108,1.9225,0.0002,5.804,3.036,1.5349,4.4485,0.032,6.8762,1.2521,3.8308,2.863,0.2357,2.4738,3.1592,1.176,1.3438,3.0866,1.2534,0.652,2.0647,3.0485,0.3788,3.1782,0.8402,5.475,1.4197,3.2509,0.3302,1.3317,1.7818,5.7579,1.4746,1.5805,1.188,3.3975,1.7661,4.2743,3.887,5.2058,0.9754,6.1483,0.8237,1.9605,4.1198,1.4189,0.8629,6.5363,2.6093,2.2061,0.6676,0.3446,7.1651,2.3472,2.4221,0.0157,5.3701,1.289,2.8426,6.0353,0.6132,2.4302,4.8339,4.2507,1.1628,5.6745,0.0106,3.6966,0.4724,0.8732,0.0002,1.9823,5.6613,4.0031,0.2581,0.2233,0.4783,3.3042,2.9003,3.7915,5.2973,2.8768,4.3208,2.7572,0.6693,1.4086,2.0169,4.0278,3.5336,0.0052,0.4278,4.7237,1.1958,2.1875,3.3438,2.0947,6.2264,0.0453,2.4368,1.1432,4.1635,0.8928,3.9684,1.8581,1.7859,2.3041,4.6984,1.8311,1.0581,0.4626,0.543,2.7629,2.2641,2.4313,0.0035,4.5291,3.6493,4.5924,0.2918,3.4719,3.4916,0.7048,0.7345,0.3125,0.0002,3.5125,4.6366,0.0009,3.4484,4.3478,3.0149,4.4437,0.6966,5.1921,5.7034,1.2312,0.9797,4.4749,1.3678,0.4236,0.7959,3.7062,5.0231,5.7508,0.9788,2.5946,3.5417,4.0682,1.2421,0.8698,0.0002,3.4438,4.6226,1.3815,1.0535,5.4197,3.7873,1.2666,1.8688,4.7627,5.1506,2.8749,5.7271,1.0045,0.6209,3.5323,1.8195,0.0756,0.3622,3.8678,1.8635,4.468,6.0568,1.1702,3.4145,3.4937,0.2334,0.3971,0.5723,0.5701,0.0002,4.7568,3.2503,5.6857,3.2876,5.156,2.7359,0.4454,2.5104,5.0763,1.1955,3.2173,5.5876,0.2871,1.2445,2.1272,5.6589,5.003,3.039,2.1107,2.0021,1.8932,4.7814,0.2925,4.1341,0.008,1.1481,1.713,0.8162,2.9042,1.5664,5.0906,1.4079,1.2845,0.6579,6.5867,1.2268,3.8606,1.3222,0.9947,3.8282,2.5696,0.8632,4.8015,3.2981,0.669,3.6633,1.0416,1.4638,3.3851,5.091,1.2322,2.1817,2.8766,1.0021,1.7629,0.0002,2.6827,5.7853,1.4668,5.2617,4.3743,2.9939,0.1218,0.7533,4.4514,1.0687,5.0465,6.3469,4.1388,2.835,5.3832,1.8097,1.7299,4.2335,2.9579,2.9544,5.2476,1.3494,1.2065,3.2196,0.9547,0.7263,0.5931,0.0002,2.1563,1.7057,4.0589,0.2823,0.0115,3.1907,6.113,1.4789,0.6724,0.0002,3.8996,0.1578,1.8186,0.0334,0.1339,2.5157,0.0782,0.1258,2.9824,6.2199,1.1486,5.8945,3.508,0.9491,2.0757,0.1474,1.9108,0.0665,0.7384,5.2992,4.1831,4.2895,2.7626,1.0158,0.7197,0.0002,3.2142]}

{"id":2149,"ended":true,"length":482,"gen_text":"Revolution in Utopia.\n\nIn October, in the year since Hitler's first visit to Berlin to meet his Nazi victims, G\u00fclen and his group attempted to organize the \"anti-fascist\" movement, which he labeled the \"Stalinist,\" and to launch a criminal gang.\n\nG\u00fclen and other leftists were also accused of breaking into a local synagogue, and killing three people. However, it is interesting to ponder the extent to which the murders were carried out with the use of explosives. There are a number of reasons for G\u00fclen and others involved in the activities, with one such factor being that they were organized by the Nazi Party.\n\nG\u00fclen and his associate Joachim Schachtmann, members of the SS (Jewish Federations Reichsler's Secretariat), and some of the party's members, were known to carry out \"extermination\" crimes such as arson or killing during the occupation of cities.\n\nG\u00fclen and his associates also conducted \"torture squads,\" as in a case involving a woman who had been stabbed to death by members of an anti-Nazi counter-revolutionary group. Among other things, this was also carried out on the streets of Berlin.\n\nG\u00fclen had been accused by the Jewish League of the Right (J.L.R.) of the same crime in February 2005, but G. Reich said as late as December of that year that these actions were carried out solely by the local police force. And when the Naxalot police announced, \"the G\u00fclen murders had become a crime against humanity,\" G. Reich went on to say:\n\nThere has been no one to date in Jewish history who has never killed anyone, including homosexuals. No one has murdered anyone, especially gay men; there is no history of homosexuals having killed homosexuals during the Nazi days. And nobody knows about G\u00fclen's crimes, particularly after the events that led up to the G\u00fclen murders.\n\nOne can also look at how G. Reich took up \"anti-fascist\" and \"anti-war\" rhetoric.\n\nWhen you consider all of these actions, one can conclude that G\u00fclen is not the first terrorist to assassinate a Jewish leader. However, if the alleged targets are communists, Jews, and leftists, this kind of action would clearly be considered a \"terrorist activity.\" This does not imply that some of these targets were \"conspiracy-minded.\" However, by stating that some of these were \"terrorists\" and others were \"extremists\" and others wanted to use the Jewish people's \"sacred human blood to commit violence,\" it also suggests there was much more at stake.","token_len":552,"entropy":[4.3959,7.1042,4.0474,2.5376,1.3463,0.0083,3.1214,5.5037,1.7523,4.0437,1.5991,4.1013,5.2912,5.317,0.7349,4.4921,2.9296,0.1321,2.3689,3.7189,3.5578,2.1085,4.4754,5.2812,0.1639,5.7736,1.6178,1.7677,2.3978,0.918,4.6246,5.4064,0.0941,3.9071,2.4681,3.0765,5.2375,0.0288,2.0057,0.9709,3.2459,2.4364,1.2939,3.9093,4.0536,1.5571,0.2887,5.458,0.3649,0.3702,5.9374,2.2586,2.294,5.0482,0.6719,5.8858,5.5473,2.2412,1.7978,0.0003,2.1483,0.0383,0.0001,2.2193,2.6951,4.3089,2.4071,2.7361,3.2829,0.142,5.7665,1.6267,2.5309,4.2175,3.4257,1.6192,2.2736,4.9432,2.9125,2.0425,1.2451,5.3944,0.0344,3.5962,1.439,5.4496,0.1541,7.8108,1.5939,3.4373,0.4858,0.0009,1.6278,5.8977,1.2455,1.9225,0.002,3.5462,1.0974,5.5013,0.0025,4.9882,0.8886,4.7178,1.3624,2.9701,0.4613,0.0075,3.3778,1.1354,4.4205,0.0054,0.0001,3.1063,3.5038,4.7031,0.2994,0.739,4.4275,2.7606,4.7164,2.7221,4.2075,3.0891,0.2956,1.2214,1.384,1.1943,5.3373,1.0027,1.1806,4.0654,1.0327,1.1148,0.8525,0.0001,2.1812,0.0577,0.0002,1.5884,0.8068,5.7264,5.8029,0.0189,0.0003,4.3844,1.0172,3.0987,1.5451,5.6959,0.0027,0.2151,3.1025,3.6333,5.1587,4.6988,0.403,6.0791,1.3662,4.1761,1.3483,2.9488,0.4568,0.7571,3.1621,4.4793,0.8321,0.8801,4.8497,0.475,2.9668,1.5282,0.9599,3.3268,0.5302,3.6657,0.1435,3.4352,4.7862,0.9405,2.1248,5.1141,4.2297,0.0014,4.1064,2.737,4.1824,5.8304,0.9952,4.6465,0.4692,3.7288,1.0155,1.3253,0.0002,2.0975,0.0349,0.0003,1.3938,0.5806,0.6548,1.8958,5.2507,2.4611,4.9503,0.4231,0.0189,6.4084,1.0126,4.1139,3.2146,3.531,2.9393,2.2322,1.7231,3.7574,1.072,1.7419,0.8449,5.0893,1.1904,0.0012,1.4162,2.8783,0.005,3.7268,2.3011,0.0026,1.2768,4.9824,0.2674,0.8707,0.4911,0.8935,0.552,5.8239,1.4418,0.7552,0.035,3.916,2.2623,4.862,1.5179,0.0007,3.0063,2.0825,3.5068,0.2235,1.5137,1.2555,0.5732,0.0001,1.823,0.0275,0.0004,4.0968,2.1923,3.4495,1.9596,1.3328,3.9451,4.8392,0.3497,2.3821,4.0451,1.7162,1.0105,5.1004,2.3915,0.5639,0.2373,0.507,0.2711,4.4128,4.0422,2.5926,1.8628,4.553,5.2764,0.8477,2.0915,4.4341,3.2569,6.0642,3.9504,6.045,2.4346,0.0126,3.0338,2.53,0.8306,0.0232,0.2261,4.9713,3.3708,0.4188,2.9179,0.0012,4.8979,1.2217,1.593,6.0303,1.6428,3.2942,0.6034,6.2863,4.4955,1.6281,5.7645,7.1141,1.0794,6.8021,2.0947,4.6007,4.7229,2.4185,2.9449,5.1156,0.339,0.0054,4.554,4.4665,4.1296,1.01,3.044,1.0686,0.6732,0.5123,1.5185,0.7398,0.1384,3.6382,0.2365,0.1242,0.6781,2.9963,0.9143,0.0002,4.3098,3.2786,0.6001,0.9262,5.376,2.838,4.8762,2.9726,6.314,0.7258,0.4668,0.3346,5.2357,3.9067,3.7231,2.2338,3.1744,6.1492,1.0816,4.045,0.3067,0.8237,3.9774,1.2435,1.9407,4.32,4.8153,0.9162,5.4893,2.4984,1.1059,0.3225,5.3104,0.219,2.7093,2.7851,2.8064,2.0883,5.591,0.6345,1.9483,5.5759,0.3819,3.1486,4.81,3.937,3.2846,4.2938,0.195,0.0007,0.5405,2.6234,2.0695,5.4628,4.1144,1.0638,4.4772,2.7979,2.0046,0.9188,0.0045,0.6016,3.0435,0.6903,0.0027,0.4698,0.4392,0.6885,0.0002,4.5344,2.302,2.3002,3.4796,0.4899,3.9843,1.4043,0.9497,0.0817,5.1171,3.6379,4.7366,2.1161,0.0069,1.7147,0.1263,2.8431,0.5813,0.4532,0.0022,4.6976,0.0188,4.0405,1.5863,1.8123,0.0001,4.5249,5.847,2.2884,4.0817,1.0203,1.7988,3.6658,0.6766,2.2123,0.7206,2.6267,0.0786,0.7334,1.0312,0.0007,2.8713,2.2694,2.5666,2.997,5.9418,1.2804,5.4842,1.485,1.4217,1.5123,0.5739,3.9131,0.0144,3.9535,2.8095,5.2867,4.7762,2.1963,5.9036,0.5645,2.0196,0.2875,1.4427,3.9473,0.1769,3.5539,4.845,0.0005,3.2654,2.2995,5.1063,0.7364,1.2756,1.3594,2.1907,1.3909,3.6508,0.4584,4.2678,4.3017,0.0776,4.2202,0.1122,6.0382,1.0533,1.0947,2.2482,0.9287,3.5237,4.7951,1.193,3.2919,0.6429,1.2447,3.1951,0.0081,5.5141,5.2497,0.5241,3.6602,0.4046,0.6522,3.4262,1.1627,4.0732,0.0086,1.8391,1.4313,2.0117,0.3591,0.4041,4.9563,0.0081,0.0477,2.814,1.9512,2.7436,7.5222,0.462,3.9816,1.9474,3.3691,1.2553,2.5358,2.0128,3.8284,0.0777,4.9516,4.1289,3.2795,3.9921,4.2522,1.0806,2.7727,3.6805,2.5416,5.5553,1.3058,5.2857,0.9732,3.0068,0.7094,1.3909]}
{"id":2906,"ended":false,"length":527,"gen_text":"What's on the tape?\n\nIs it that in the way that those people on the show are putting it?\n\nThe idea is that for us, there's no such thing as an episode in our time.\n\nWhat does the show have to show us right now? How do you feel before this event and when it is over?\n\nWell, the main plot of this show is really that of these two characters.\n\nAre there some specific moments we're missing with the other two people?\n\nI don't know if there are but for instance, we've seen our mother get stabbed twice, what happened to our mother, now we see her being chased, things like that. I think that our mother is trying to talk us out of talking, but she's really struggling. Also, and probably most definitely, they think, \"It's so important here.\" We've watched a TV show about some of the other female characters, and there's a lot of things about them we really don't feel confident about as women.\n\nAre there any scenes you'd like to see in there too?\n\nI'd like to see one of the different places: The streets. The way the city has now changed so much is because of what happened to those people in the beginning, and I think we're really going to see the same reaction over and over again. They're more isolated as they were before.\n\nWhat will it be like to come back after this?\n\nIf we can get to that point after season 1 then I'd love to see what people think. When did you guys leave the show? I know my little girl, her family have left me, but I didn't have that much time to think about her family, that you can't just go and find her, because you have to remember what she's going through. There's nobody who can touch her. I'd love to see if you leave the show. I think it's a big, big deal. We're at a point now where the internet is completely new and the world isn't giving us anything. People are talking, you're not going to get anything out of The Walking Dead and people are saying, \"What are you talking about???!?\"\n\nWhat about we will return?\n\nYes. The show is over.

{"id":659,"ended":true,"length":525,"gen_text":"An unbeatable supervillain conquers the world, rules with an iron fist, grows bored, and eventually retires from public life. Years later, you strongly suspect the old man who just moved in next door is that retired supervillain.\n\nHowever, that is exactly what he does. But who can blame you if he finds himself in a situation that would cause you problems?\n\nJust keep in mind how difficult it is to get your life back on track with those years after graduation. How do you feel before you finally learn to live with those struggles and your expectations and expectations about your future?\n\nHere is 5 ways you might overcome the obstacles that might prevent you being successful in your new career:\n\n1. Start a business. While doing so, you might find yourself in a business environment with a customer base who will likely want you to succeed because of their experience with a particular brand or service. You will also learn about the importance of relationships with employees and service providers.\n\n2. Stop taking your jobs seriously. Even though they understand, you never truly know what you have to work for, and you may feel that the job won't suit you. It turns out not only can you become miserable when you feel that your situation is a complete waste of time, but you also may feel that it is very stressful for your job prospects too.\n\n3. Learn your strengths and weaknesses. The way you deal with problems may be your own, sometimes without realizing it, sometimes unconsciously without any conscious thought. This is especially true when life's expectations for your life are in turmoil because of your mistakes, as they are always.\n\n4. Avoid taking on responsibilities and responsibilities at work. The responsibility of keeping an eye on your finances and yourself, and getting to the top end of your budget, is your job and this is certainly something that is expected of a manager. Don't worry about yourself or your partner, your customers or your associates, just enjoy the company.\n\n5. Recognize those problems in your life will not be what you expected out of your job and career.\n\nThe most important aspect is to understand that you have a responsibility to deal with your problems internally, not through any job advertisement or job offers.\n\nOnce you have taken on these roles and been fully invested in them, they won't stay you, they won't allow you to fail. When you truly ask yourself what will give you that sense of accomplishment you think you deserve, the world's foremost advocate will help you out. Once you have the confidence of seeing that you can deliver and succeed and it's done, you can even make it a habit to make your lives a little bit bit easier.","token_len":553,"entropy":[12.9991,0.0162,13.2333,0.0263,0.011,14.2215,0.0055,1.4659,1.5905,2.0152,8.8992,4.256,3.7154,0.8132,0.2298,0.6868,7.62,6.3505,1.7117,0.8389,4.3642,6.9772,0.0163,1.7581,5.0766,0.0992,0.4555,8.249,0.3115,0.2478,6.4437,12.6366,1.5835,2.9848,6.1301,1.5978,3.2759,5.6427,5.7417,2.1906,5.627,0.0776,1.943,5.9127,8.4353,5.151,0.0049,0.003,1.3965,2.3067,0.0021,5.7357,0.09,4.1089,2.7206,3.59,0.2733,2.4525,1.5098,0.9662,5.389,3.8472,3.763,2.838,1.2213,2.5592,2.2389,4.0233,1.8471,1.3994,1.0776,2.0113,1.9289,3.352,3.5524,1.1813,4.5301,0.7688,1.7406,0.0002,5.8864,5.3672,1.4251,0.0097,5.4786,4.0017,0.5951,0.3742,0.3555,2.6861,2.8645,2.6999,0.6184,0.3011,0.0149,3.5131,5.6781,5.974,5.2011,4.6356,0.4783,4.9939,2.8952,0.0736,3.2812,6.0968,0.9467,3.0458,4.508,1.2763,2.0201,0.624,2.7193,5.7851,2.3901,5.0639,6.0511,3.837,1.8946,3.8404,1.3972,1.4004,0.5529,0.5581,0.0002,4.785,1.9485,6.9573,1.9796,1.4598,3.8606,2.9359,1.8877,1.791,1.3078,4.2087,2.1089,0.1064,6.9684,1.4497,1.1298,1.3028,3.5732,0.8665,1.6816,0.1543,0.0001,0.6329,0.2251,4.2457,2.1041,3.0378,1.5542,6.2624,5.4339,2.9549,0.5429,1.4572,0.9667,1.9643,0.4529,1.3637,0.6211,3.361,3.3876,3.1967,1.5166,5.7252,2.0143,2.9096,2.6735,3.2032,3.0127,2.2447,0.4391,3.0448,4.624,1.1758,1.7619,3.6168,1.6082,4.3845,3.0864,1.67,1.5268,1.3493,0.3662,3.039,3.2756,1.5938,4.1894,2.6359,1.3651,4.3892,0.0341,5.0742,2.0635,4.5896,0.9755,5.7366,0.4558,0.8416,0.7543,0.0001,0.6765,0.0009,4.3414,3.6316,2.528,3.8628,2.2716,0.1154,3.768,1.2319,4.175,6.3773,4.3406,1.266,5.4937,3.0333,1.3999,1.3268,1.1724,3.3664,0.501,2.193,0.6485,1.8655,2.183,1.4095,1.9651,2.659,1.7935,3.1108,1.8486,5.8679,0.0006,3.9822,0.1537,1.2876,3.2654,6.4909,0.0111,6.2034,1.5051,3.1062,0.4059,4.9305,5.3111,3.6275,0.6326,4.486,2.142,2.0617,5.8593,0.672,3.7911,2.9744,0.801,0.1423,0.5614,0.3282,0.3477,0.8833,1.9504,1.8418,1.3014,0.5087,2.6627,1.5027,4.4248,3.7842,2.0974,2.0593,2.814,2.463,4.4352,0.1171,0.5772,0.0001,0.205,0.001,3.7884,3.9898,3.122,0.9731,0.5165,0.1255,3.5645,5.0821,0.6978,2.704,0.002,2.7494,4.0811,1.4398,3.9399,1.791,2.2604,7.0856,5.1068,2.8551,0.2763,1.7209,3.5525,5.4994,6.6975,3.3415,2.2936,1.1669,0.7861,3.3675,1.2709,2.6626,0.2027,1.4627,6.3177,4.1171,4.4614,3.8853,1.7853,2.8542,0.9679,3.8748,5.9454,4.4625,0.6746,1.8306,5.3715,1.4897,5.041,3.2232,1.3659,3.8967,2.3308,0.6314,0.0002,0.3236,0.001,4.7863,4.8549,2.3752,3.143,2.764,1.6305,3.7928,1.3032,0.1907,3.2516,5.1608,1.8863,4.2857,2.8462,1.0005,0.0836,0.5274,2.8972,1.3875,5.5076,2.8515,2.1387,4.9527,2.512,1.9769,2.5449,6.4412,0.1622,0.4244,4.9425,1.4922,1.0303,3.3371,3.683,3.2674,4.8525,0.8051,5.9482,2.0788,0.924,3.1505,5.3304,0.176,3.6447,3.24,0.6133,5.1292,0.0005,3.9608,1.0633,5.5088,2.6764,0.635,4.7697,2.0967,3.4816,4.7598,1.4701,0.7664,5.1307,1.2453,3.9959,5.0013,1.5593,1.6221,1.521,0.6191,0.0001,0.0579,0.0007,5.5579,0.0038,5.9668,4.0455,3.1967,0.3771,0.3889,6.7549,2.7294,1.2926,5.4958,0.5005,2.7758,7.1038,0.0039,1.7205,1.3042,2.7018,2.8513,0.3965,3.8224,0.0002,3.5008,3.8369,0.5902,4.7966,2.9524,1.1962,3.1617,0.9432,1.5271,2.2622,2.1458,1.9111,0.365,3.9526,0.0146,2.0217,0.927,6.6738,1.5587,2.0946,3.5433,4.5276,3.4929,3.2441,0.7478,2.7075,3.359,0.4398,1.7057,0.0002,5.1452,0.0948,1.4587,3.8902,1.1169,2.0864,3.3059,1.5301,4.6525,4.3981,4.6067,0.1267,1.326,0.2133,4.1773,4.06,0.0007,5.7145,4.6805,2.3079,1.4242,1.1645,0.0001,5.1262,0.1107,0.0392,4.9612,1.5433,4.5175,0.4182,5.337,6.0062,0.7492,2.0177,2.9879,5.3897,0.0735,3.8143,3.4759,0.0143,1.8148,3.2182,4.7803,0.6069,2.342,0.3229,2.7911,4.6236,5.03,5.566,5.1883,1.3841,2.2364,0.1383,4.2978,0.6803,6.7871,0.1577,1.3929,3.5923,2.3276,3.6894,3.7292,1.2707,0.9287,1.8928,4.8256,2.9784,2.8047,4.2958,5.0713,1.5179,3.5759,0.3647,0.8468,1.8923,5.3225,3.8912,2.0276,2.6795,1.6296,0.316,4.0378,2.6225,5.2994,0.8949,0.6151,1.3961,5.9976,0.6006,0.5317]}
{"id":27,"ended":false,"length":527,"gen_text":"What's on the tape?\n\nIs it that in the way that those people on the show are putting it?\n\nThe idea is that for us, there's no such thing as an episode in our time.\n\nWhat does the show have to show us right now? How do you feel before this event and when it is over?\n\nWell, the main plot of this show is really that of these two characters.\n\nAre there some specific moments we're missing with the other two people?\n\nI don't know if there are but for instance, we've seen our mother get stabbed twice, what happened to our mother, now we see her being chased, things like that. I think that our mother is trying to talk us out of talking, but she's really struggling. Also, and probably most definitely, they think, \"It's so important here.\" We've watched a TV show about some of the other female characters, and there's a lot of things about them we really don't feel confident about as women.\n\nAre there any scenes you'd like to see in there too?\n\nI'd like to see one of the different places: The streets. The way the city has now changed so much is because of what happened to those people in the beginning, and I think we're really going to see the same reaction over and over again. They're more isolated as they were before.\n\nWhat will it be like to come back after this?\n\nIf we can get to that point after season 1 then I'd love to see what people think. When did you guys leave the show? I know my little girl, her family have left me, but I didn't have that much time to think about her family, that you can't just go and find her, because you have to remember what she's going through. There's nobody who can touch her. I'd love to see if you leave the show. I think it's a big, big deal. We're at a point now where the internet is completely new and the world isn't giving us anything. People are talking, you're not going to get anything out of The Walking Dead and people are saying, \"What are you talking about???!?\"\n\nWhat about we will return?\n\nYes. The show is over.

{"id":1056,"ended":true,"length":516,"gen_text":"In life, you sold your soul to as many entities as possible so that when you died they would have to fight each other for it.\n\nHowever, that idea is almost completely dead and so many beings are now living in space in order to make up for it.\n\nThe world you live in has become a nightmare, a nightmare of demons and other life forms that you would be unable to deal with.\n\nThe demons inside of you feel like nothing will ever happen to them, and they have already established that they will never exist again in the universe.\n\nIt is this realization that will leave you with regret.\n\nYou can have a very bad experience for years, since you will eventually see your true self again, which is very much your ultimate fulfillment.\n\nYou still know your self, you still love and trust her, you still hate her and are very happy about her, your parents, your family, your friendships.\n\nI can never imagine how much you have changed since then.\n\nHow much you are growing apart.... How much you are in control of your own existence.... How much you are dependent on one another.\n\nAnd how your life is very unhappy.... where you want to be. When your loved ones die..... When your loved ones will be reborn.\n\nNow, there are demons inside of you that you always knew were dead and there are other entities that you must deal with, even if they are dead, and even if they are even now, it will always be at least a little more pleasant when you accept them as your own.\n\nNow, the devil is right inside you, so, when they return I will tell them at my own words, so that their very true nature will be established as a reality.\n\nNow, before they begin to call for help you will need those demons, because you will not be able to be with them.\n\nYou will have to deal with them, and you won't be able to tell others what to do when your life begins to run into the ground at night.\n\nOnce your life begins to turn into a nightmare that you are unable to deal with anymore, you will feel absolutely lost.\n\nThis is just the point of your life... now that you know you are still a terrible person now... but...\n\nIn the end you can never be able to live without

{"id":1756,"ended":true,"length":514,"gen_text":"Write a scene\/episode\/arc from your favorite TV show, movie or comic that has inspired you to pursue your dreams. The more you write these dream scenes, the more likely you are to find success in the world, and the better your art will be as your art progresses.\n\nNow, after your art has been approved and produced, and you have the resources to create an actual dream, you will have time to prepare for the next steps. Then, you're ready to do some art. The more you write the more likely your art progresses and the better your art will be as your art progresses.\n\nSo, with this, the next step: If you want your dream art to be successful, you'd better prepare yourself to do it in advance. One simple step would be to schedule a time to use your art from your DreamMaker blog or any other dedicated art blog, and go through a checklist and send it to a studio or publisher.\n\nAt this point, you've found yourself ready for a great art project and ready to begin. You should have already set a budget, and if you don't, your art is very unlikely to survive your next purchase. So instead, start thinking about what you want for your next project, and start making sure your dreams are fulfilled. At this point, you can go ahead and try to find something that will work for you for at least a year or longer. If that works as your dream, or you just can't find the kind of art you can, and you just don't have time to prepare, then give it a try.\n\nBefore you give up, and start writing in this next step, I would suggest you take your art as a very long-term investment. I have a great friend named Jody. She's always been working on her art, so she always brings a few pieces of her art during each semester.

I just got out of the cab... I got out of my car. Sandeep: I love you.\n\nNow we will finish the game by showing each player how we played the game. We need at least a two time win, two more kills as well, and maybe three more chances. What are the odds for a team to win these games? It is very easy to overestimate the percentage of odds. The more games we play you are losing, the more this percentage should fall away at the beginning of the season. We'll get better in the season as each player gets better and better. If you are playing well before this we will win those games, maybe you will play better at the bottom of the standings. Once we win these two games you are going to be good again, for we could be good again. If you want, you could get some bad luck. Don't lose the big three.\n\nNext time we make sure I am doing everything I can, you can play the full match against us. The next time is just one win and we will get better at keeping the team alive. If you want we will not win... if we stay alive we will die.\n\nFor the next few weeks, my wife and I are going to work hard this month to play the top 3 teams in the tournament. We will try to stay good, and we will try to play well again for sure.

{"id":1131,"ended":true,"length":528,"gen_text":": the world as we know it only has two rules : You own everything that you can carry, and you must carry everything that you own.\n\n: The world as we know it only has two rules : You own everything that you can carry, and you must carry everything that you own. If you want to be a merchant, your life is a game. In order to remain a merchant, you need to have all your needs met. The more people you own, the more you buy, and the mergers and acquisitions take place. The more you make new goods, the more we buy. On top of all that, you're a king, and you need to have a certain way to talk to people with your true essence.\n\nFor any one of you, this list is a guide: your life is a game. You need to live like this.\n\nThis list can be helpful when your life revolves around a big trade, which will change everyone's priorities in the long run. A huge trade is probably going to mean that the price won't go up significantly. Also, while I know you're not on a tight budget, I wouldn't call a trade such as this boring. You need your life to get done, otherwise your whole world will fall apart.\n\nI'd also also point out that the game only starts with 3-4 people, and doesn't just start out without any 3-4 players. There is no real game of any kind in WoW, because everyone is involved with it. As long as you have 3 people working with it like you will, then your life is about as good as you could hope for.\n\nNow, the rest is up to you. If you live in this world, then I would suggest you take your time thinking about it a ways before your decision. If that sounds like the game to you, then that may save some time.\n\nBut if not, I'd recommend you don't get too close to this one, and move on. I'd suggest you just start taking care of your daily life, and think about what's going on around you. It's so much fun, even if you don't play it any more.

This will be an easy fix, because we currently know what a trademark is.\n\nIf the book is published in UK English with the title 'This Is A Dictionary', then your publisher is going to probably never give permission for it to be published there. Your publisher should now be paying \u00a320,000 a year.\n\nI'm getting tired of making the rounds in this forum about this. A couple of weeks ago I said that a few people asked if I'd be ok when it came to using a word like 'dictionary' instead of writing some research paper, which probably makes a great change. So hopefully this will change as well. At the moment there are a couple of sites that try to make those things work. The other alternative is to use e-books. The two are called dummies.com and dummies.com. But for now, just tell me if you're an idiot (and if it's just you and me) and let me know what you think in the comment section I should find an alternative. One is called 'The Dummies Site'. They're not as funny as my site is, but they still are. On Facebook they make the comments on each article and you will automatically see what the other site does. There is one site called 'The Dummies Foundation'. It is an internet community which is really good, but I don't get it.

{"id":2374,"ended":true,"length":532,"gen_text":"Describe a world where your lifespan is determined by your IQ, and how much that affects the way you live.[4] The age at which you'll die is defined as: 10 years.[5]\n\nThe age-based disability scale is not a scale of disability but is an arbitrary and subjective scale that is subjective.[6][7] [8] The scale is not designed to measure a person's physical or mental abilities, but rather to give an idea of the social status of some specific person. The person with the scale is not more powerful or more influential than the one with the disability scale.[9]\n\nThe disability level is the amount of time an individual is expected to last. Generally, a person with a disability is expected to live until he or she reaches this level, though some adults can live up to the average, and a person with a low disability level may live to an average.\n\nFor example, a person with high school diplomas may live only a few weeks. A person with a poor grade in school is expected to live roughly every third year. A person who is academically successful and lives on less than $10,000 a year may live to one year. When determining whether someone lives 100% on the ADA, it may be useful to choose a disability where the person's ability to go about their business has always been considered disabled due to the risk of overtraining in certain sectors due to the high rate of overweight and obesity among the poor. The ADA would give a person with a disability a more favorable disability scale than a person with a high percentage of disability. The term disability means a person with a disability is likely to experience disability with increasing frequency. One way to classify people with very low or no disability is as a person with: Moderate disability\n\nOverweight or obesity\n\nDementia involving severe pain or discomfort\n\nHigh blood pressure during pregnancy\n\nHigh blood pressure during childbirth\n\nA person with low disability is expected to have a lower number of problems than a person with, or not likely to use at all.\n\nA person with low disability can have a disability that isn't necessarily disability. For example, you may not be able to walk but still be able to talk. That is generally because your disability doesn't affect you much. People with the lowest disability level are likely to be more capable of walking, more able to talk, and less likely to be obese, so you may not need to use high level of force to walk.\n\nIf you are diagnosed with one of these conditions, ask about your disability scale, how you managed it, and the disability scale's standardization date. If all of these criteria are met, you may have a disabled life expectancy at death.","token_len":559,"entropy":[8.2919,2.5971,6.1476,1.4745,4.1387,9.567,0.7204,3.5928,0.2081,1.6958,5.8045,1.9416,1.8228,2.1815,2.0569,5.0014,1.7448,2.2843,3.0085,0.2852,2.1733,6.7702,3.5766,0.1146,3.409,5.5673,1.8655,0.0618,0.7989,4.9485,1.601,0.9007,3.7385,1.1995,3.4484,5.0772,1.2817,3.0632,0.2287,0.06,1.0937,0.0004,2.4215,1.793,5.7095,1.9925,5.6561,5.0156,1.6835,4.6398,2.4329,3.5864,2.3955,1.7723,3.1129,2.504,2.3547,4.0366,3.9891,2.8582,2.0891,1.6538,1.9485,5.429,4.1361,0.0917,2.7364,0.0409,0.2098,6.0523,0.0683,0.1133,2.1547,2.9197,0.9556,2.9079,3.532,0.2158,2.0091,3.2615,0.3653,0.0386,2.5965,1.5328,0.1471,3.2325,1.2968,0.9987,0.6589,1.4582,4.3644,1.5707,1.9825,0.1372,1.8838,5.3831,3.0912,0.4609,4.9403,4.6209,1.2841,1.1751,2.026,4.3316,2.3409,0.9118,4.9607,1.3415,2.9554,5.6657,4.5005,1.8809,2.0666,3.3965,0.2771,0.8514,2.3832,0.8692,0.3539,0.7616,0.753,1.2505,0.1551,0.1041,0.6601,0.0002,1.701,2.3557,4.5493,1.25,3.1104,2.9965,0.3262,0.338,4.0631,0.0932,2.1569,2.9211,0.0534,5.8694,1.4357,5.2006,0.7945,2.1347,0.495,0.3784,0.7863,0.1248,1.6825,0.8086,0.0152,0.7146,3.7159,3.4519,0.2583,0.001,0.8415,5.1374,1.184,1.6402,4.2431,1.4214,5.6711,2.9709,1.4479,2.0682,0.0105,3.4974,3.32,3.5025,1.9703,3.6409,0.8107,0.1277,0.5938,4.8322,0.092,0.9953,1.3351,0.9965,3.1144,3.2629,1.3376,1.8012,1.4818,0.0001,4.1375,1.1589,0.0769,1.3389,0.4847,0.149,4.1097,5.1692,2.4797,0.0199,1.8047,0.8268,4.6613,2.1293,0.6144,2.8085,2.5571,1.6395,0.2061,0.0576,1.1826,3.7315,1.8601,2.6917,1.2362,2.74,0.4482,0.0048,0.3711,5.7585,4.3965,4.6697,1.3593,1.1676,1.5078,0.1836,3.3974,1.0712,5.5819,0.0002,3.3249,2.3171,3.4866,3.4025,2.4735,0.2189,0.6626,2.0121,0.2277,0.0121,1.1692,0.0112,1.4753,0.3797,2.6198,4.756,0.6015,1.5149,5.58,5.229,2.6526,2.1529,4.7204,6.1406,0.5974,4.348,2.0612,5.599,0.5937,2.0115,3.832,0.3646,2.5379,0.0246,5.5309,1.159,0.959,5.8173,1.4146,1.2623,1.9902,3.092,0.3085,5.3802,1.241,0.3529,4.2551,2.8508,5.9665,0.1391,3.4963,5.2842,5.4563,0.0054,1.971,5.275,0.2927,5.2898,2.6423,4.2516,2.272,4.1762,6.0323,0.0086,1.9652,3.1677,3.3548,0.0358,5.8174,1.2232,0.2361,1.9603,1.878,4.0644,1.0501,3.0306,1.9174,4.4899,4.4856,1.1834,0.6721,0.3081,0.7646,0.4556,1.1113,4.3,3.3889,4.4682,3.2172,1.1235,1.1234,0.1043,0.4012,0.626,1.3042,6.253,0.1995,2.5569,1.4125,2.8483,5.7411,0.77,3.4139,1.985,1.159,1.0706,0.9559,0.2846,2.86,3.4896,0.0536,3.1629,3.4319,4.7032,5.0381,2.4589,1.2912,5.6036,2.8986,0.3764,4.6019,2.7931,0.2925,6.1266,0.7892,2.2327,1.2832,0.1825,0.391,1.4699,2.2732,1.3,0.4761,4.5397,5.3606,2.2558,2.3563,0.0002,5.8415,0.509,0.6345,0.6227,0.3703,0.0004,3.7571,2.6962,0.0036,7.2341,4.1211,2.9894,0.8389,3.2282,0.5595,0.0004,4.5217,1.0663,0.0487,7.4133,0.8195,0.8547,0.0005,2.6854,0.897,0.8859,0.4212,2.3576,0.3814,0.0005,3.6219,0.4138,0.2285,2.5483,1.4375,2.0801,1.8953,0.0112,2.0088,1.5566,2.4865,3.782,0.024,3.518,1.4494,0.5403,0.0449,0.0675,6.9078,2.2482,5.3432,4.5455,0.0116,6.3566,3.5093,0.1166,0.9991,1.5533,0.0002,2.4055,0.1599,0.1518,1.9534,0.2334,2.7134,1.8292,1.6005,2.9348,1.4006,5.3404,0.001,3.7305,5.3924,2.5342,1.2888,0.0526,0.0298,5.2198,1.0322,2.1573,1.0029,0.1563,0.0045,1.7157,4.8439,2.3887,1.4999,0.1338,0.0126,2.7378,1.0428,5.0066,2.2969,6.0944,1.8917,2.1343,1.7255,2.5899,0.0005,3.2261,1.8079,3.0863,1.2389,3.9141,0.1192,4.0835,2.733,0.1462,0.9776,1.4284,2.5224,0.0473,1.3671,2.1493,4.5413,0.834,3.0638,1.5955,4.9793,1.7084,0.0098,0.9129,0.3762,0.4827,2.0554,0.3341,0.0142,1.5929,2.6757,2.6447,3.5126,2.2894,1.1995,1.976,2.4111,0.5275,2.569,5.4813,3.6499,2.1225,3.803,1.024,2.4305,0.9493,0.9014,0.0002,3.3592,0.6448,1.6192,3.3458,0.1092,4.8648,1.024,1.7449,0.7126,0.4464,4.9626,2.5787,1.2757,1.6765,3.4157,2.6555,3.8039,2.2466,6.0269,1.2163,0.1218,0.3702,3.445,4.2436,1.5303,2.5306,5.471,1.7836,5.4017,0.4136,2.2675,5.6911,0.8244,0.9363,2.6206,0.3854,0.1412,0.1833,1.1753,1.3163,2.0121,1.1541,4.6642,2.6313,0.8875,1.7472,3.3713,1.0865]}
{"id":4722,"ended":true,"length":538,"gen_text":"Write a story in a society where time can be directly sold and bought.\n\n. The more people who have been trained to work in the public sphere, the more people will say yes to things that have already been said.\n\n. The more educated people will say no to ideas that are on the outside.\n\n. The more educated people will say yes to things that are on the outside. For a moment, this suggests that education is a choice. But actually, we're talking about people choosing to have an education. So what has happened with this particular issue of time? It's because there's a certain way we've done our job effectively\u2014we've had a pretty terrible period of time.\n\nNow, the more educated people tend to have less time to argue, the more likely they are to have a debate, and the more time it takes to respond, the more it increases the possibility that someone might not have the time to argue at all. But that goes for all of us\u2014more people, fewer people in any given situation. So it's become not as if everyone just gets to defend their choice, but it becomes that if you can defend it, your choice is made to serve the greater public interest. The greater the public interest, the higher the chance that your own actions influence what others say, rather than the public interest.\n\nSo we're talking about a kind of self-conscious choice. People want to protect the public interest, and so far that's been done, but you might notice that it's harder to defend when you're trying to make decisions\u2014sometimes it's easy to go overboard and try to avoid responsibility, but in this case we're talking about people trying to serve a purpose in the public good in ways I don't think anyone is able to serve.\n\nSo you can see we're losing those things, because everyone wants to defend what they consider their own. There's nobody who can serve the public good. And people still want you to try and bring people in. If you want, you have to spend a lot more time trying to get people to care about what you have. This isn't what you're looking for, you're looking for some kind of responsibility. The fact that you're only looking for things that are important isn't worth that much of a commitment now.\n\nAnd I think I really want to go over this in less detail, but I think that there, in this case, some of these things people feel are very important, that I want them to care about and they want that right. It makes sense for more education to focus our energies on the right thing. And it makes sense for all of these things to work hand-in hands. It's a good thing.","token_len":562,"entropy":[4.0641,5.7875,3.5903,3.3888,8.5393,1.72,8.489,4.1984,0.7324,8.8309,8.0018,2.898,5.5662,1.7222,1.5366,0.0029,7.6757,3.6337,4.2262,2.6929,1.8339,3.0211,3.5862,5.1264,0.9893,3.4318,1.5003,1.7936,4.5436,3.6779,0.4056,0.0839,0.5263,3.3046,1.0859,5.5843,3.2098,0.4992,5.0474,1.6544,3.4136,2.8599,0.4009,2.6648,0.6669,0.843,0.0002,0.3956,1.5237,0.6587,5.2976,0.5683,1.2222,1.081,1.8816,0.4035,4.2428,0.3155,1.5575,5.6379,0.3276,3.7567,2.1222,0.2318,0.0002,0.2157,0.5928,0.2017,1.262,0.2488,0.1182,0.2297,0.4201,0.0386,1.6641,0.047,1.1404,0.3716,0.008,0.7691,0.0201,5.9091,3.1413,5.3378,0.5659,3.5033,4.9968,0.4591,4.5301,0.7912,1.8679,4.9735,1.0661,2.1154,5.7257,0.6522,3.1186,2.514,1.5301,0.1351,3.8968,2.7945,0.9067,3.7925,3.1541,0.1476,1.2271,3.8087,3.0058,5.4245,1.7583,3.6076,2.2952,5.1045,3.7457,2.0913,3.1888,2.155,2.6064,0.6826,4.3538,3.3845,1.0817,1.7173,3.6029,4.353,3.2551,2.7961,4.0687,3.9838,0.6599,6.5044,4.3351,2.3928,0.7571,3.4802,2.1144,4.8214,5.7864,6.0512,0.9179,0.8237,1.3676,1.5912,0.0002,3.8028,0.4338,2.9855,4.1268,1.4735,0.4073,4.7021,0.0274,2.986,3.0022,2.0151,0.5533,5.1709,2.4547,2.3146,0.6514,1.5068,0.3593,0.2749,0.0295,3.2889,1.803,3.9527,2.0659,0.9038,1.249,0.3781,3.0616,3.4527,0.1027,0.7738,4.5022,1.5697,0.4853,0.6109,4.2634,5.2775,0.5832,4.6184,0.9095,3.3335,2.3053,4.0543,2.3453,1.6996,0.7889,0.6229,2.7129,3.6187,0.0443,0.1627,2.8681,2.3701,6.5435,1.6759,2.3291,1.5607,0.2717,3.1286,5.7243,2.258,2.9843,5.0144,1.083,3.9355,5.3783,0.7683,1.6371,0.5219,2.1176,2.3178,0.5292,5.7906,5.7108,4.4736,1.855,4.6374,5.1116,3.6175,1.6973,5.0109,1.1558,4.3851,1.6156,0.6581,2.1945,2.7933,1.3391,3.4694,1.1484,2.8354,3.5087,1.7285,0.4696,5.2404,0.847,1.1074,3.448,4.3171,6.3003,1.6104,2.8535,4.9581,1.7863,0.4658,4.4304,3.9713,0.8832,0.3653,0.0276,0.2943,0.1579,4.3278,0.3122,1.8788,0.7568,3.8756,4.3629,3.9785,5.9555,3.9266,2.2151,3.4407,2.1532,5.0978,0.0032,2.4671,2.8665,0.2722,0.4965,0.3464,0.0001,2.0925,2.6916,1.5011,2.5772,0.1881,1.7692,3.7539,0.0007,4.2924,0.0347,3.8307,2.5141,1.2776,3.214,4.023,0.3575,3.7569,2.6775,1.0163,0.2016,1.1104,1.2369,3.1026,5.8297,3.5295,0.5029,1.1799,3.8791,2.6589,0.7,4.5873,3.8194,5.4504,0.5166,2.9122,0.6026,5.5655,0.7413,1.8691,4.1778,1.0653,0.8914,3.6945,0.0224,2.9244,3.1088,4.1217,4.8277,1.8802,0.4386,4.3172,0.4825,4.5553,4.1188,1.3926,2.6041,0.1455,4.5099,4.4891,1.5531,0.6945,3.351,2.712,0.389,2.9811,0.937,0.8844,0.0763,1.8904,3.5593,0.0596,5.3744,2.5516,4.1784,3.0154,1.7786,0.6229,4.4232,4.9281,3.016,7.3951,2.1471,0.0003,0.4698,1.9038,3.2602,3.4515,0.0241,5.5677,0.6378,0.551,0.0001,2.3382,3.5024,2.116,1.6985,6.5233,0.5805,5.3723,5.3989,3.5636,2.6109,2.5542,5.1458,2.3513,0.2265,3.1919,3.2639,0.5346,4.8884,2.1132,0.9532,2.4599,4.1524,0.4405,6.5207,1.7027,1.6403,4.9052,1.7428,0.7494,0.5394,1.52,2.4541,3.887,5.1559,1.4711,6.1124,0.0461,4.3692,1.6465,5.7767,2.8173,2.2626,1.9429,3.7663,0.5161,2.804,4.8113,0.7275,2.2384,0.1547,5.8498,1.3751,0.2073,2.7402,0.1013,2.7473,0.045,2.7175,0.5003,0.727,4.94,0.4995,2.0092,0.6748,4.1198,2.9121,5.2541,3.1602,0.0002,4.5817,2.342,2.0826,3.7218,0.1307,1.8554,4.1022,0.7803,0.4217,0.0341,4.3121,1.3225,0.0007,5.612,0.7101,4.0925,4.4701,0.5731,1.362,1.0092,5.3846,2.7096,0.2783,4.9639,0.3107,1.798,3.1565,5.0602,0.0002,4.01,4.4123,0.8584,3.4283,0.5837,2.4758,6.7587,0.5539,0.381,0.0001,3.0254,2.487,0.6841,4.6805,5.5438,3.2103,0.3606,3.7484,3.2252,1.9811,1.9004,5.5499,1.3281,1.039,1.0336,1.2048,0.8697,2.3607,2.8973,8.0453,1.8363,2.5791,1.3131,0.1251,6.1678,1.2581,2.4632,1.0204,5.652,4.4415,1.9215,3.7329,0.8585,1.5641,3.1199,3.745,3.1212,2.4203,0.0484,1.7427,0.2056,3.3169,3.6249,1.1962,4.1099,5.1081,1.6529,3.5441,4.1133,1.0286,2.1861,6.9978,5.3411,0.7673,3.1244,6.1613,3.2661,0.319,2.1265,4.4631,2.5271,1.2228,2.5808,2.7528,1.534,0.0255,0.4325,4.9338,0.1958,3.4856,0.3252,0.2065,3.7417,6.6887,1.0004,0.0029,8.3734,0.7747,3.1063,1.0467,2.2557,3.1226,0.8449,1.7737]}

{"id":2460,"ended":true,"length":513,"gen_text":"These days everyone just gets any knowledge they want by downloading it, you're a martial arts master and you just got your first student in 10 years. So where do you go in MMA training to learn to be able to pull off a shot-put or defend yourself?I did the same thing when I was a fighter to learn to compete at a tournament or a sport. My main goal was to make it to the next level before I quit and go into MMA.I've been looking for the right guy for this role for a while and it feels like no one has said goodbye to him. His training philosophy always aligns with what I feel most comfortable doing and I feel comfortable doing it for him because I feel that he'll be perfect for this role. If he doesn't want to come to Jiu Jitsu then I can't be the same with him. I won't use martial arts as a weapon but I really hope that I can help him build what will be one of the most powerful grapplers in the world.\n\nRage vs. Bum\n\nI love Bum. I'd love for any number of things. A rematch with Ronda Rousey. A rematch with Frankie Edgar. A rematch with Renan Barao. A rematch with Daniel Cormier, one of the best fighters of all time. (I will say this now that I know who Bum really is, so there are a lot of amazing things he could do!) I would love the opportunity to match him in a Bum.I've always loved mixed martial arts, but I know now that it's too late. That won't sit well with the guy who is so accomplished in all of sports. The MMA community is still on guard and looking for somebody who I feel is capable at my level. He has all the tools to become the sort of man I could ever hope to be. If he's available to meet his destiny, then so be it.\n\nMMAmania.com is proud to have this partnership with Bum.\n\nWith that out of the way, we could bring you the latest news from Bum. He has officially announced his resignation.\n\nI would love it if you could have any comment or advice. So let me know what you think, and if you're enjoying this site, please stay tuned. There will be so much for us and you all to do on the upcoming fight between Rafael dos Anjos (who has won over 1000 of these contests) and Mike Magee who, like Ronda, would love to fight for this company.\n\nI would like to thank my co-host, Paul MacLean, and the MMA Fanatics group (MageEmpire.com), for their support over the years.","token_len":562,"entropy":[6.9502,6.6829,5.2534,4.1647,8.2221,8.2748,1.3693,0.9971,5.0975,6.9973,2.7092,1.8715,4.7906,2.971,4.5165,11.4974,1.9363,1.977,1.6681,0.9261,3.3747,4.9409,3.4753,2.7664,7.7918,3.0613,5.0038,0.368,0.8837,2.8999,6.0704,1.1711,0.3879,1.4284,4.8738,4.5962,3.0166,3.3991,1.2878,2.1378,2.2493,3.904,0.0069,5.3325,0.7291,1.475,5.7416,5.3357,2.2379,2.8506,5.2125,1.818,1.3089,7.5239,5.21,3.1523,1.8304,0.3955,2.8676,0.1444,0.607,1.5703,3.9839,5.1091,1.6459,0.7948,5.7022,3.1359,1.8471,4.4694,2.5935,2.1829,4.3775,1.2934,4.2742,3.8416,0.8564,0.6044,0.2139,3.2294,1.8358,1.5693,0.782,2.2451,0.0953,5.2489,0.5729,3.8554,2.3994,3.1979,1.9527,1.1386,0.7857,2.863,3.0491,1.3653,4.9408,1.1003,2.8496,1.4894,3.3085,2.0585,2.5154,3.5502,1.081,1.3333,1.6852,2.1111,2.7116,5.2741,0.5203,5.0237,0.2947,1.1559,3.6935,5.4427,0.5297,4.591,0.7477,4.561,4.8098,3.1769,6.275,4.9644,0.0428,0.5734,1.9144,0.4085,4.026,4.246,0.7349,1.0781,1.9262,1.6984,2.1102,3.4761,1.8428,0.7798,2.5702,0.718,3.0263,1.1473,1.6756,3.1128,1.3207,3.8703,1.3939,5.7989,0.3294,1.9971,0.5513,0.5814,4.4901,1.2622,1.9227,0.0003,2.7012,0.2541,3.9813,1.8596,6.6157,0.944,0.0,3.2215,0.9107,2.7974,1.5167,2.9263,2.9715,3.8342,5.2757,0.2539,0.5372,2.0517,5.8394,0.0099,6.0881,5.3576,0.0491,1.9837,0.467,2.9776,2.025,0.8205,5.1967,4.3949,1.2202,2.3678,0.6065,2.7886,0.5701,4.8549,6.042,4.5873,0.8302,2.4252,0.0174,0.1881,1.6714,2.7676,4.5536,0.0157,0.4441,0.1906,0.4438,0.6659,3.2784,0.0004,4.3426,5.0589,5.0664,0.7489,5.4646,5.1161,2.2732,0.0003,3.0241,3.7533,2.2597,0.0077,1.2036,1.4645,4.7906,1.5625,2.8471,6.052,5.0215,0.0062,2.6124,2.4766,3.9761,5.4902,1.2124,4.1854,1.6664,0.3307,0.0003,2.3097,1.3925,2.0752,0.2969,5.348,0.0173,0.4503,0.9009,0.6573,0.1021,4.5134,0.2983,0.0107,0.0202,0.248,0.9335,0.4135,0.0601,4.7765,0.0573,0.0001,3.9478,4.6581,0.1576,0.4817,1.3678,1.642,2.2265,0.735,0.0288,0.2521,5.9447,2.2599,5.0143,2.2014,1.0992,4.4388,3.2874,0.5682,1.9711,2.8883,2.3641,0.0107,3.8511,0.0638,1.7644,4.4257,4.4,1.9775,1.8697,0.522,0.1564,5.9029,1.6431,2.1364,1.1471,0.6809,4.5062,1.8323,2.6586,0.598,4.3388,1.5716,0.0808,5.5224,1.1971,2.1974,1.4197,4.9376,0.6598,6.2869,3.4884,3.9368,2.9344,1.6,5.4593,0.0058,0.0102,1.589,1.1615,1.1438,4.0161,4.948,0.4242,2.5262,0.6572,3.4406,1.839,1.2117,4.3978,6.2827,0.0014,6.2162,0.177,0.0132,3.1197,4.6481,1.6799,2.2697,3.0726,5.7681,1.5038,3.6349,1.7689,2.9402,0.6496,3.7325,4.3236,2.1602,1.4706,3.7291,5.045,3.4146,2.0638,5.4445,0.8542,4.5615,1.0961,5.9843,2.6611,1.847,2.6407,6.3655,6.5907,1.2807,1.0656,3.5482,2.4712,4.1874,0.3374,1.4698,1.1158,2.561,1.5675,6.2976,0.0065,3.8084,1.0186,5.2161,2.786,2.0472,0.3454,0.1833,0.5895,3.5979,1.2277,2.568,4.4752,2.3186,4.2955,3.4535,3.7835,1.0939,1.6401,4.4259,0.0743,0.0015,0.1515,1.1997,0.0002,4.6356,0.6474,4.0082,1.9811,0.2205,2.6774,3.4011,0.0296,2.8097,5.0237,4.0262,0.3511,3.1513,0.0124,0.7932,2.0141,0.0002,5.6646,3.632,3.4573,0.0159,0.0042,0.0001,0.2675,3.5613,5.9704,5.7872,0.2025,1.7723,2.5157,1.4048,1.5776,3.5541,0.0115,2.003,3.5878,2.48,4.8778,1.4897,0.5206,5.9565,1.9546,1.1941,0.0001,3.6976,3.2782,1.0881,3.1846,0.0514,0.4401,0.969,5.1958,2.845,3.0519,1.1623,3.669,2.6265,5.4268,3.2227,1.1789,0.0425,1.1611,0.0811,0.082,2.8729,1.559,1.8317,0.3563,2.7983,6.2852,1.463,4.3417,0.8281,1.1934,5.3618,0.1959,1.5243,5.4695,2.3193,0.3765,4.6206,0.3104,5.6246,1.1831,4.6469,3.0365,3.2494,0.1485,2.59,4.1647,1.6183,4.7351,3.7552,3.5066,5.4046,0.1941,0.0011,0.0002,0.0001,3.253,3.913,2.5774,3.1572,4.5584,5.3882,4.5716,3.3418,3.5176,0.7989,0.0458,4.586,2.8438,0.0119,5.7842,4.7971,2.881,3.3856,0.0701,1.0374,5.1149,2.3474,0.2151,1.4065,3.0201,3.5979,4.1665,0.3102,0.9595,0.0002,3.2296,2.4479,2.9257,0.0892,0.5964,3.423,4.4991,0.0338,1.7304,1.5338,5.1181,5.8154,2.5859,0.8257,2.1684,2.3302,2.7811,5.3473,1.9194,4.972,4.1933,3.0854,4.0784,5.9685,3.6227,0.5332,0.2827,2.1137,1.3682,1.6024,1.2391,2.6456,0.0745,0.6981,0.5418]}

It really makes so much more sense to me that you have joined my team.","token_len":562,"entropy":[11.3946,6.9901,2.6725,4.2566,5.6347,6.2011,3.416,2.5685,7.1635,9.3905,1.2348,5.1573,2.2065,0.718,1.4551,0.7942,4.4363,2.2953,3.3175,10.7016,9.5672,7.4647,3.8221,0.2593,2.6543,8.6113,0.5163,2.3994,0.8963,0.7521,6.5187,3.8773,9.4485,6.6372,8.359,2.5595,2.0811,1.4033,3.393,0.1534,1.7911,0.1585,4.7358,4.9932,0.0377,0.6051,2.5727,2.2628,4.3656,4.0576,4.4339,3.9042,0.0166,3.0737,2.835,0.6723,2.1373,8.0408,5.706,3.1105,0.6415,3.004,1.2631,4.0408,5.0873,0.519,0.9699,3.4698,2.4043,1.9986,4.5596,6.1126,3.2932,2.2839,1.0436,2.514,1.5017,2.1394,2.3539,2.9756,1.5898,1.7474,2.2007,3.5684,0.6327,1.8009,3.5841,0.5803,4.2829,1.7511,3.0894,1.1141,0.8319,5.4198,1.1289,3.3086,1.8224,0.9826,4.0726,4.8473,2.5395,1.1543,4.4588,1.3949,2.6053,3.938,4.91,2.0235,1.4994,1.64,0.5052,4.1955,1.5265,3.1348,2.0141,5.5652,1.4585,5.7924,1.2269,1.3395,2.3193,6.2784,0.6583,3.5818,5.5864,5.106,5.7509,1.1829,0.1818,5.6574,1.4166,3.1496,4.0788,3.6621,4.4324,3.7736,2.5619,0.8471,3.7846,1.1708,3.8425,0.5584,1.7418,3.7298,0.9613,1.9833,0.7884,6.222,3.2708,2.1197,4.454,3.9753,5.0306,0.2863,1.8031,0.9366,5.4411,2.2593,4.8648,1.1517,3.2228,4.69,0.1105,3.5795,3.2946,4.0582,0.8946,1.0816,3.0274,2.0305,2.1094,1.7452,1.6118,2.0486,2.2122,3.9859,1.4001,1.9256,1.9609,2.4578,0.5975,5.0904,0.9332,4.0481,0.3849,1.0658,3.7233,1.339,4.1468,1.2108,4.0249,0.1947,1.7775,0.9906,0.7733,0.1564,2.3345,2.181,2.8178,2.6511,2.0467,2.269,0.1003,4.9325,5.912,6.3751,0.954,1.7624,1.0762,0.9627,1.7687,0.1738,0.9597,1.5205,1.3655,4.202,2.9856,1.9158,5.5551,5.8052,5.539,1.4919,2.7594,3.0935,1.9818,4.0903,0.0066,4.4654,0.5947,3.5091,0.2695,3.0572,1.9485,2.6965,1.7118,1.9894,0.7904,0.9949,3.2314,0.9007,0.3123,3.2826,0.4499,0.157,2.2939,3.3277,1.5426,1.5418,4.4481,3.8858,1.6804,2.2919,2.4861,0.0152,1.7984,3.7573,0.597,6.0903,0.849,0.6769,1.1314,2.0445,1.6813,2.3354,2.3461,3.0665,5.7379,0.5435,0.5892,5.5842,3.6418,2.1012,2.6495,4.9469,2.1778,4.1738,1.8061,2.9131,1.4075,3.2755,6.8325,4.7618,0.2838,1.2305,1.6135,1.0423,3.3953,2.6664,1.5008,6.4314,4.2069,1.4807,4.1729,3.2393,2.5682,0.4842,0.3673,6.0234,1.564,4.0892,2.0897,1.7609,2.6722,0.5721,3.2535,3.3579,1.4589,5.3738,2.525,2.0782,4.2831,3.0941,0.3101,0.7389,4.742,2.7183,1.9833,7.1216,5.958,0.1053,0.7384,0.5045,2.1569,3.2734,2.634,1.8988,5.576,1.4881,2.8839,1.9428,0.5374,2.798,1.2961,0.1659,1.5411,4.0374,2.2769,1.1982,4.934,0.8146,4.357,5.4782,3.7387,1.6363,1.3621,5.4481,4.2325,2.8826,2.0207,3.6986,1.3955,0.0335,3.0437,0.6753,1.4403,0.3942,0.6923,6.3279,3.6614,2.6971,1.7643,5.4392,6.9096,0.6037,2.5681,2.3429,0.2467,0.9662,0.6293,2.9721,3.5619,3.209,3.6548,0.2403,0.1637,0.2692,3.4907,1.1022,1.0589,1.1332,3.6339,2.3423,4.3508,5.818,1.102,1.6839,3.9811,1.6115,0.8903,4.6089,1.3073,1.9315,1.2381,2.6502,1.3689,3.8704,0.9902,1.5768,4.5228,4.5181,1.4248,4.4159,1.4982,5.2932,5.5349,5.5856,2.8764,5.1918,0.9311,5.0331,3.2033,5.648,1.6454,5.6661,0.2424,1.2681,3.2855,3.3665,2.8177,4.094,2.8068,4.8558,0.7064,0.9865,0.0721,3.7104,5.4646,6.0378,1.1073,5.3784,5.2159,1.2211,0.5227,0.9465,3.0979,0.7747,2.6113,3.6385,3.0262,5.4576,6.0055,1.0789,4.8495,0.0223,1.3328,7.0176,0.0411,5.9511,4.217,1.9172,2.6683,0.3467,2.7677,5.0476,1.3284,0.4292,0.0014,1.8921,1.3444,2.4823,5.9579,1.5634,2.5778,2.7176,2.9135,4.5973,4.9031,0.2499,1.184,3.2852,0.0006,5.3691,4.7686,3.9885,0.3175,3.9804,0.808,0.972,0.5768,1.6737,6.3611,0.3843,1.5053,6.0221,3.6324,6.3873,2.1486,2.4298,2.1442,2.8969,0.8721,1.3185,0.5959,5.0515,3.0413,5.1166,3.1168,0.3473,4.6771,0.2385,2.4059,5.8182,2.2304,2.4365,0.857,1.4473,5.6669,3.5828,2.3129,3.4999,2.9232,2.438,1.3279,1.6755,1.2139,2.6131,3.2585,7.1161,3.7202,1.6137,3.5298,6.7444,1.7832,0.0511,5.1823,1.7687,0.671,1.7792,0.1645,4.1135,0.7454,4.9753,2.1097,1.6493,4.085,6.2198,2.2439,1.4831,2.7096,5.8201,3.6495,1.0579,2.1257,1.5001,0.8995,5.4221,5.8735,3.7443,5.2242,0.0592,2.3137,0.0435,1.456,1.3759,1.9979,0.7416,3.351,4.4255,2.3572,1.5601,0.6612]}

And he will say, ''I did not scare you...

The person with the black hair was more likely to look confused and sad, because there were fewer dead souls to talk to, with less certainty about who had been there for weeks or months.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Fogg, a professor of psychology at the University of Maryland and an expert in the history of life in the brain, said that in a place like Los Angeles the ghost would find the others far easier to look at than it did in New York, and he said that when the person departed from the dead places, then only the ghost would see him afterward.\n\nIt is not clear whether the person did anything to his people, such as putting the dead bodies in boxes filled with cold water or taking the heads to an electrical cord. L. E. L. White, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Arizona, said that it was impossible to tell with certainty what was going on, since many ghosts leave behind people who have been dead for thousands of years. He said the body itself must be preserved, rather than \"remedied.\"\n\nMr. P. Morgan also pointed out, though, that the police report found no sign of a criminal investigation. Instead, the family put out a statement that said that the owner of the home had been arrested but had not returned to live with the people who killed him. As she spoke her wife was on her way to Los Angeles to collect her children from a church, Mr. Morgan said.\n\nIn Los Angeles, that statement would have been so widely circulated, he said, that it would have included the story of a young woman dying of pneumonia, a story the family also tried to hold up.\n\n\"A person's life in real life may never change,\" he insisted.","token_len":563,"entropy":[3.8828,5.0829,8.7648,0.7277,1.415,4.3039,10.3303,2.0125,4.2986,6.7487,6.9185,4.9031,2.1655,1.5823,2.717,4.9136,4.577,4.219,2.4787,3.5945,0.7938,2.5048,3.0694,4.1372,2.8804,2.6841,4.1613,1.3765,4.8048,1.7362,4.9667,0.5773,5.6623,0.2202,4.167,4.8171,1.2727,5.053,1.0578,3.3869,5.3348,0.6519,4.3245,1.4538,3.0729,3.2553,1.6173,0.0336,4.9378,0.4188,0.0012,0.0003,0.0013,0.0013,0.0016,0.0001,5.5755,4.8033,5.8828,3.4664,0.6148,3.8241,1.3948,1.6692,5.6565,3.7231,5.2849,3.6854,1.5551,5.5201,0.8541,1.2708,2.1603,1.897,1.0932,0.9968,5.6657,2.3805,1.087,3.9551,2.3773,2.0556,1.1352,4.2616,1.5959,5.2137,0.2569,1.9281,0.2297,3.1043,1.9435,0.2592,2.6185,5.4527,4.8687,0.5518,4.8447,2.6551,2.737,4.8903,0.2835,0.3113,4.8564,6.6763,1.5016,4.364,1.1575,3.5341,3.9239,1.3201,4.6019,3.8396,5.0818,2.4458,3.5179,0.1014,1.8867,6.0305,2.9263,5.9942,1.6115,1.7824,2.1143,2.0567,2.4976,4.4863,5.6524,1.724,0.3005,0.5462,0.63,0.0006,2.7316,0.0004,0.0013,0.0001,0.0005,0.0004,0.0015,0.0013,0.0053,0.0003,0.0011,0.0016,0.0007,0.0019,0.0004,0.0009,0.0003,0.0009,0.0007,0.0013,0.0,0.0006,0.0001,0.0007,0.0003,0.0006,0.0007,0.0003,0.001,0.0006,0.0005,0.0004,0.0017,0.0005,0.0002,0.0002,0.0003,0.0005,0.0,0.0008,0.0005,0.0017,0.0014,0.0006,0.0006,0.0006,0.0004,11.7016,0.0192,0.001,0.0001,0.0005,0.0012,0.0018,0.0009,0.0005,0.0013,0.0019,0.0011,0.0007,0.0008,0.0003,0.0003,0.001,0.0012,0.0007,0.0013,0.0003,0.0005,0.0006,0.0003,0.0006,0.0005,0.0005,0.0019,0.0003,0.0005,0.001,0.0008,0.0006,0.0005,0.0007,0.0007,0.0005,0.0007,0.0002,0.0004,0.002,0.0006,0.0003,0.0001,0.003,0.002,0.001,0.0006,0.0008,0.0007,0.001,0.0004,0.0005,0.0,0.0006,0.0005,0.0007,0.0009,0.0,0.0002,0.0003,0.0002,4.368,4.308,1.5525,4.4711,4.1922,0.4111,4.9009,1.9615,5.3372,4.7936,0.2337,0.8819,0.9483,0.1887,1.3457,0.191,1.0692,0.1542,0.0048,3.5656,2.0173,2.6639,0.2603,0.686,1.5364,4.2694,0.0562,6.2829,1.4647,1.0485,5.4131,0.1041,0.4933,0.8304,3.2848,2.7913,5.0346,0.6854,4.6819,0.0374,3.9234,1.8456,2.0895,5.277,2.6471,5.9907,4.9243,4.3028,0.3245,4.9956,0.8186,1.4208,2.9721,1.4727,0.6807,2.3737,0.1004,1.6519,1.5104,2.9286,1.7346,0.7687,3.6816,1.565,2.5634,4.8808,3.5362,0.8036,3.0296,6.605,2.2355,6.0472,5.4875,1.1641,3.9363,0.9454,3.265,1.6517,7.0297,0.2632,0.4689,0.0004,4.4298,1.0577,1.6072,1.1148,1.2937,0.8099,2.8591,4.9554,3.321,1.2754,4.434,5.6664,1.2912,4.8406,0.0133,5.3887,2.8045,3.1692,2.4159,0.7515,4.0535,5.5329,0.0133,5.5871,0.5534,1.1238,3.6883,2.0968,5.3773,3.1937,3.3286,5.393,5.3104,1.1163,5.4249,0.1851,4.3626,0.0369,4.4836,0.7228,5.7524,0.2509,0.6099,1.1252,0.1596,1.6323,0.1791,0.8028,0.2373,0.0046,4.6227,0.4947,0.3577,0.6908,3.2807,0.7364,3.1848,0.2767,2.2394,4.6656,0.2619,1.8282,1.9444,0.8115,0.1742,2.2557,2.1273,3.3779,3.7207,4.0073,3.3139,5.7909,0.7054,1.7034,1.6378,1.8113,0.3375,5.0694,0.0619,0.0248,0.4298,2.895,0.6118,2.5412,4.8017,5.3159,4.2989,1.4777,4.9128,1.4895,5.3415,0.0396,5.4187,4.1442,4.702,0.0656,1.2898,0.2591,0.0004,2.6959,0.0015,5.328,2.7262,6.0094,4.229,3.4338,0.3691,3.7455,2.147,0.1551,0.037,1.6403,6.0323,4.2266,5.671,0.8639,3.5507,0.4285,1.8679,3.554,2.6258,1.1399,5.4355,0.1398,1.4683,5.1668,5.6607,2.2807,0.4213,0.9636,1.9651,0.8017,1.633,1.1241,5.666,0.4963,0.1849,2.3531,1.2465,1.6419,2.3674,4.0953,2.0706,0.7727,4.9699,0.9248,4.3264,1.6977,1.0871,3.9159,1.467,4.2459,1.0015,0.2698,5.9966,6.1425,3.8466,5.3261,4.3977,2.7481,4.41,1.3646,0.51,0.6764,4.8223,0.0071,1.2738,4.2564,1.1641,2.3361,1.9842,2.6097,2.9087,2.236,3.167,0.0005,0.6637,0.3089,0.542,0.7051,0.0003,3.1832,3.4929,0.004,0.3287,5.8198,3.727,4.7628,0.7542,1.0019,5.4612,5.4876,2.1525,2.4296,2.1308,0.1405,0.034,0.1103,1.388,0.9487,0.1788,5.8564,1.6978,4.1823,0.3096,1.5185,2.7884,1.4953,5.2972,1.484,4.0113,1.9664,2.9882,2.4061,3.3203,1.7872,5.4321,4.4826,0.0877,5.1703,2.0308,1.2254,0.7323,0.0003,1.5138,4.6427,3.6972,2.5973,1.9676,4.2517,6.7423,0.2635,4.3589,3.212,2.342,0.809,1.4412,7.4956,0.2345]}
{"id":2817,"ended":true,"length":531,"gen_text":"To our surprise, humanity is the most coldly rational species in the galaxy.\n\nHowever, that assumption is true since humans are generally viewed as completely indifferent to these phenomena.\n\nSo then, how do we know if the world actually exists?\n\nThe answer: Because everything we know about life is based on the most basic questions.\n\nHow do we learn to make the most of this knowledge, and how do we use this knowledge to evolve?\n\nWhen we start thinking in new ways, the question we're forced to answer has no answer. There are a variety of reasons for why we don't want knowledge to evolve.\n\nHere is the problem: There are very few general answers. For example, a scientist can know what foods contain the same amount of proteins as some other organisms, but they can never know whether any of them contain the same amount of glucose.\n\nI can never imagine someone using a technique to analyze food samples based on its exact content.\n\nWe wouldn't want to know the difference in how much we'd eat if there was no clear evidence that the food contained enough protein.\n\nWe would want to know how much calories we'd put ourselves through to give rise to some very specific, biologically plausible (and somewhat self-evidently \"tactic\") explanation. At the same time, the question of how much we'd increase those calories would be the same question over and over again.\n\nIn fact as you've noticed recently, that answers almost always have answers like \"there is no such thing as a food without protein\".\n\nLet's take a closer look at a hypothetical study conducted on human populations in 2007 in which I compared both calorie intake and calorie consumption across humans and their surroundings to what appears to be a simple equation.\n\nThis may seem like a trivial mathematical equation, but the reality is that it doesn't work. All variables don't work in this way and if we can't even make up the meaning of these differences, we will have to rely on the assumption that there's no such thing as a food without protein.\n\nIt would be useful to try and see if there are any problems we can address as part of our understanding of the universe: we could just try and think about all the things we should be talking about today.\n\nThe answer now is absolutely nothing but an assumption I've made for some time : \"if we assume there isn't such thing, then we have to ask a new set of questions.\"\n\nSince that's so much work, I'd like to turn to another question and this time I'm going to test it \u2014 the question of whether we should believe that God created human beings to look like the kind of aliens created by Stephen Hawking in 1967.","token_len":563,"entropy":[6.5755,5.7173,0.5081,11.2471,2.3885,3.9915,2.3645,8.7379,3.5383,4.5288,2.0397,1.8766,0.4318,2.6257,0.72,2.0279,0.0113,5.412,0.0944,4.133,5.8883,1.0829,5.8349,6.7961,3.5586,0.8589,5.4687,5.1532,0.2127,5.8688,3.9722,0.5253,5.2701,4.4494,0.549,2.3141,0.0002,3.8039,5.593,0.7161,2.5368,1.6861,0.338,1.6948,2.7369,2.3817,3.6279,5.9269,2.344,0.4384,0.6077,0.0002,2.4401,1.294,3.1649,3.8231,5.8673,1.663,1.1652,0.2913,2.3406,1.0913,1.306,0.092,2.3611,4.3117,1.4076,5.8187,1.6695,0.3923,0.0002,4.0179,0.9797,0.235,5.1246,1.351,4.1636,3.3637,0.8002,0.4394,2.7728,0.8629,3.2757,1.001,1.1558,0.3937,0.0215,3.5091,2.3482,0.0403,0.17,5.6551,1.4696,0.0975,0.0002,4.8696,0.9142,4.0915,2.8219,4.0561,5.9827,0.434,0.3555,3.2494,3.4008,4.069,2.2219,4.5472,0.0215,1.2554,4.4736,3.6355,1.4155,0.5929,5.329,1.0395,3.2556,3.6167,0.0078,3.2032,1.3916,3.4967,1.4154,2.3359,0.0005,3.1088,6.0634,1.8587,2.4085,0.8163,0.4187,0.0001,3.9805,2.8295,2.3067,4.1763,1.0549,3.9425,0.6291,3.6705,0.2284,5.7287,3.0469,1.6754,3.7146,0.5562,0.0512,3.9844,3.7117,2.5163,4.7013,2.8512,6.0659,3.2362,2.7024,3.5275,1.2352,0.0129,3.5017,0.7607,5.1016,1.5197,3.5875,1.1915,0.5628,3.3522,1.62,3.2579,0.816,2.5999,4.2965,0.7928,1.2592,0.6925,0.9744,0.0468,0.3714,0.0051,4.7132,0.8269,0.6092,0.0001,5.4392,2.865,3.6217,4.9701,4.7011,3.7687,1.3017,5.7281,2.2747,5.3604,3.3539,2.9247,5.3949,0.0883,3.5736,4.0004,3.5197,0.9859,1.0871,0.0001,3.4456,5.9046,0.001,1.7179,0.3287,1.1499,2.482,4.0379,2.3376,3.3465,1.0116,4.9215,3.8148,2.1023,1.263,3.53,1.1474,0.9611,5.6686,3.1003,1.231,1.9309,1.0518,1.0465,4.8389,1.6488,0.8411,0.3022,0.0002,2.4622,1.5952,0.8585,0.2083,0.1469,1.9371,1.3682,5.2888,1.2403,0.7592,4.4876,7.7159,1.0228,1.5658,5.8684,1.7827,0.0046,4.3843,4.5439,2.3772,3.3192,4.7551,2.8953,5.4004,1.196,4.8307,5.0762,0.0244,0.6978,3.0719,4.7785,4.7945,5.685,0.3738,4.0414,1.1475,7.5788,0.9711,0.6147,0.0028,0.0312,3.2388,2.371,0.9525,1.0381,1.346,1.5276,0.8744,5.466,5.4133,0.3491,1.4654,1.0245,3.901,1.5396,1.6999,5.8913,0.1091,0.0089,0.6612,0.5173,0.2641,0.0002,3.1477,2.7367,10.1408,3.4805,3.453,4.8669,6.0756,0.1388,5.1651,6.5108,4.1325,0.2944,3.1318,4.7559,5.9766,0.8909,4.8254,1.1453,0.8231,1.69,0.0281,0.0468,1.2602,3.6338,3.4286,2.2755,2.0589,0.3224,0.0002,4.8704,0.1954,1.8306,0.761,2.1221,0.0025,0.1945,2.8537,3.5058,4.8868,2.8503,2.955,3.433,3.5617,1.7925,5.9385,3.3332,1.6795,5.0136,5.1126,5.9659,5.9375,0.7546,0.2419,3.4265,2.486,3.7769,4.3338,2.3047,3.4285,4.4144,4.1891,4.1278,4.9646,0.0571,0.0409,1.0645,2.7457,3.7208,1.375,0.3232,0.0002,3.4657,5.8037,0.8683,1.1166,0.4894,2.7706,4.1231,1.2894,0.6546,0.1186,2.8664,3.7289,0.1113,0.7305,1.0763,3.5049,0.0007,2.6068,1.315,5.7285,6.4984,6.1462,0.0009,2.9073,2.4143,1.7279,0.6849,4.017,4.5927,1.1558,3.3378,0.5655,3.9797,3.9127,2.8189,1.9581,6.3575,0.2392,2.8692,5.974,0.444,1.4419,3.3902,2.7209,1.2224,3.3602,0.111,2.227,2.7775,0.1809,2.4978,2.3191,0.9069,0.349,0.0042,0.0537,0.5799,0.4295,0.0787,0.1157,0.252,0.142,0.0002,3.875,3.469,0.7029,4.7862,0.3173,3.5838,1.3996,4.0868,0.798,1.9816,1.1883,0.7998,4.8404,4.4403,0.5692,3.2178,4.5155,4.201,0.0011,1.3598,3.0667,0.0689,1.0586,1.0983,5.0926,5.0661,1.8717,4.7427,3.4376,1.3108,3.7637,1.3192,3.6365,0.6318,2.436,1.1277,4.8557,1.2292,5.0466,0.0036,5.3117,1.0218,0.2725,0.0002,2.7617,2.9152,7.5925,0.4677,6.0823,4.3519,4.0164,2.931,1.4935,6.1832,1.2363,1.0528,2.0364,2.909,0.1866,7.7393,3.031,3.3506,1.9447,4.2809,2.5238,3.7554,0.0002,2.0611,0.1184,5.7783,0.8739,1.2836,2.5886,0.6574,4.2325,4.2452,6.0452,3.8923,0.001,0.1491,1.8425,0.1973,0.0003,5.6726,3.8053,0.9609,4.0261,2.1928,4.3309,0.5514,1.1305,2.7736,0.6061,0.0362,3.6434,0.653,2.3645,2.6673,4.7223,4.3085,0.9676,1.6613,1.8147,0.3559,0.0056,5.9318,0.968,6.5048,3.465,1.0348,0.3379,1.453,1.9909,0.9286,3.8458,1.3287,5.4535,2.7809,4.3617,0.3229,2.612,3.8657,0.4229,2.545,2.8423,0.0507,6.3978,6.3088,0.7606,6.1684,0.1585,2.549,5.0575,0.2506]}

{"id":1791,"ended":false,"length":526,"gen_text":"You try to make a deal with the Devil, he refuses your soul as payment.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean that you don't accept the Devil\n\nThe fact is that you make up for it by accepting his money.\n\nThe Devil's job is not to pay your soul but to keep it.\n\nYou make deals with him and he gets his share. He may just see this as an act of mercy, or at least you might say he did.\n\nAnd it was this reason that you stopped trying to accept the Devil as your soul. You were trying to make a deal on your own terms, since he wanted you with him. A Devil's job is to do your soul good.\n\nYou still can't forgive someone who tries to make you into something like this.\n\nThis can also mean that you can't forgive your partner for making what he wanted. It can also mean that you can't forgive somebody who does something wrong.\n\nIf you see something you want to do, you want to make it right and if you feel that you should have done that, you know you should have done it.\n\nThe very fact that you can't accept him might even mean that you've taken a different approach (such as refusing the way he wanted your own soul ).\n\nNow, there are other ways to avoid seeing yourself as something that you would do the same way over and over again.\n\nIn fact as you find yourself fighting harder against the Devil, you might like to get into ways of living that you're comfortable with (and if necessary, even be happy with the way things are ).\n\nThis might be in this case, if your job is to protect your souls from Satan. If you don't like that approach then try taking the same approach.\n\nHe may see this as an act of mercy, or at least you might say he did.\n\nBut this doesn't mean he doesn't try, that's just an excuse for trying.\n\nHe might even tell you, because of your own bad behavior, that if something bad happens to you, you shouldn't stop looking for help.\n\nThis even comes up a lot in Christian circles, but it's just an excuse. That's all. If you accept Jesus and try to do a good thing now. If it's an excuse now, then you won't want to do it again.\n\nYou'll notice that you're not thinking of doing it for this reason.\n\nI think it's worth seeing if it's your turn right after that and if it's a good idea again for you to begin following the Bible.\n\nIt all depends on how you interpret the Scripture.\n\nHere are a few points:","token_len":564,"entropy":[7.1793,0.5033,3.2857,2.3068,4.686,0.7624,1.798,6.1743,1.6299,2.8119,6.9513,4.4806,7.2028,4.646,6.177,1.0495,2.0972,0.0195,5.1903,0.1249,4.6078,1.745,0.0006,0.511,1.4823,0.8067,2.7017,0.0002,4.9674,1.7315,1.0249,7.3749,0.0003,4.1169,4.5843,0.6055,0.6407,1.4325,5.7498,4.7519,2.1405,1.0952,0.7946,2.735,1.9334,3.7296,0.7681,0.4953,0.0003,2.8309,0.7327,2.9023,5.9586,0.1537,3.1765,0.2235,2.3404,2.7865,0.4625,3.3979,0.2542,3.8187,1.4723,1.3197,0.1877,0.0002,2.6186,4.4089,4.9576,0.4587,1.3285,2.4564,1.7222,4.0236,2.7842,4.556,1.4251,4.8742,4.8213,5.5655,5.6219,4.0757,0.3434,2.4436,3.514,0.1916,2.4671,1.7828,2.6785,4.129,0.2944,4.213,2.943,3.8655,2.4386,3.739,1.0323,0.4285,0.0002,4.4213,3.3539,4.714,2.9998,4.5994,0.7997,1.3221,5.4454,3.9308,0.1471,4.9435,1.1234,0.1385,2.6086,1.7003,1.2166,0.6572,3.0666,2.6261,2.4847,0.041,1.844,1.1058,0.2567,5.285,1.0204,0.5954,1.8829,1.5431,6.2119,2.1654,3.5989,2.0033,6.0118,1.2046,0.5595,6.7922,5.7011,2.8147,0.6744,0.2804,0.2056,4.7134,3.4799,4.0391,1.993,1.1724,0.6197,0.0003,2.1792,5.4801,3.5155,0.0945,5.1209,3.6342,1.5954,3.7309,0.0596,2.3464,1.0514,4.4238,2.4393,3.5695,3.0142,0.6155,0.7349,0.0002,4.2141,4.7508,3.4501,2.1857,0.4501,0.5806,3.2084,0.1928,1.3111,3.2493,3.7592,1.4078,3.2617,6.2865,1.7534,2.1782,1.1523,3.496,1.7098,0.7957,0.0359,0.1016,0.5829,1.0888,0.0358,0.7401,4.6861,0.6441,3.3567,1.6102,3.1842,0.828,0.5501,0.0002,2.8995,0.4199,4.5222,2.8844,2.7578,2.2268,0.739,0.5821,0.9046,0.9448,3.9535,0.4432,3.1662,0.9475,2.6517,2.9356,4.1898,0.4719,4.2392,1.6013,0.9193,3.5792,2.8867,0.4326,2.4023,0.6804,0.556,5.4007,2.0029,2.2049,1.1604,0.4803,0.7535,0.4823,0.393,0.0002,3.2586,6.1233,1.5294,0.1588,0.3832,2.4985,0.14,3.1414,3.0385,6.7205,3.1963,0.8855,0.172,0.2822,3.9275,4.7664,1.6535,3.2112,2.0402,6.8395,4.6901,0.0109,4.5213,2.9984,7.0107,0.7521,1.2675,4.4298,5.1405,0.8692,8.0294,0.2393,0.0003,4.5783,1.0452,3.3566,0.7587,2.7356,1.5238,0.8312,3.939,5.6092,3.3642,0.2677,3.1801,1.6421,1.3709,4.099,2.9686,5.1347,1.8471,0.4512,4.9872,0.1126,0.0027,0.4581,0.422,0.4527,0.0002,3.8491,2.1291,9.0212,1.6706,5.274,0.8048,5.4678,5.3226,2.8292,0.9843,0.2504,0.6377,0.6103,0.9548,6.0113,0.0972,4.8281,3.9502,5.0386,2.4973,4.4066,1.0418,1.7318,3.9363,3.1156,0.3025,3.834,3.5639,4.763,4.3247,0.719,3.4113,4.8693,3.3048,0.6048,3.4899,0.9347,1.5568,0.205,3.1525,0.0962,0.0003,3.3766,2.3651,1.2827,3.9414,5.218,1.2776,1.7047,3.1195,2.7606,5.2482,0.6719,0.4348,4.8045,1.196,5.3554,1.7415,6.7971,1.172,3.0698,1.0431,3.312,0.0006,2.308,2.4549,4.6668,3.4003,3.7272,4.829,2.2367,2.9753,0.514,2.3398,0.3219,0.0002,5.9106,2.2161,3.5169,1.8754,0.1254,1.3867,0.1122,0.0182,0.5234,0.7917,0.4749,0.3954,0.0178,0.6504,0.075,0.0349,0.113,0.0257,0.2013,0.5659,0.0002,1.7022,3.5941,2.0685,0.0004,0.0733,3.8416,1.5617,0.0002,3.0464,4.236,4.1961,1.3306,1.5034,3.6276,3.4941,1.8977,3.8324,0.5609,0.3651,0.0002,2.8121,1.6769,1.8756,4.6683,0.0652,3.548,4.595,2.8915,1.5598,2.4422,4.6685,1.3441,0.2996,0.3401,3.2828,5.182,2.2887,0.5241,0.5419,0.1965,0.4539,0.7494,3.6934,0.0003,4.8301,4.426,0.8405,1.9087,0.5497,0.3091,0.0002,2.7121,6.5043,3.8216,1.0087,3.23,0.5914,0.8699,5.4425,3.7054,1.4283,2.3673,1.5872,0.6203,3.5346,1.9627,0.1641,2.0629,5.4727,0.4645,2.7849,0.6822,4.3925,0.593,5.5225,4.1974,2.6165,3.6091,0.0925,2.5776,4.3094,0.8086,0.8889,6.1232,4.5481,2.3722,3.7977,0.9506,3.1192,2.856,4.8957,0.9131,1.1967,1.1645,3.4504,0.0037,3.949,0.1305,1.5993,0.978,1.0575,0.343,0.3146,0.0004,2.6617,2.6556,5.7881,0.5189,2.2562,1.4125,1.9424,4.3135,1.7287,2.7856,2.3031,3.6674,5.0077,0.4778,0.8154,1.1902,0.0005,4.758,2.7021,1.8293,0.2443,4.1818,5.5413,1.5876,2.614,0.7207,3.8508,3.8256,5.1271,5.7977,2.2118,3.6722,2.4981,0.9358,0.3986,2.6835,1.475,1.6656,6.3645,3.9404,0.5363,0.8207,5.521,5.0696,1.9369,4.0525,0.8369,0.3398,0.0007,3.2671,6.0492,1.2902,0.1361,1.4322,0.6951,4.0983,1.0272,4.5425,0.5627,0.5455,0.0002,4.1926,1.0,1.6515,0.2048,3.6719,3.0091]}

( x-post from r\/writingprompt )\n\n) The poem in the center of \/r\/writingprompt\n\nThe post in the lower half of the upper middle of \/r\/writingprompt\n\nThe post in the top of the top third of \/r\/writingprompt\n\nThere are no other choices and thus the answer to all three points is a very good one\u2014you can't really say if it actually happens.\n\nA note on the question we're about to answer: If your character can die (or be reborn) because you were sent away, what type of ending would be best? Maybe what you want may be preferable to the best. As a general rule, though, I'd advise giving your character a fair chance at life (say, a happy rebirth in your parents' house and some bad things) and then, as there's so much here about the ending, you probably have things you want.\n\nWhich endings? This might be the most interesting.\n\nBut if you feel confident doing so, then I recommend not doing too.\n\nAnd, although it is very unlikely that your character will ever get to live after dying, it's possible that something (such as having the chance to see your parents again, or a death-like experience in a bar or business park) might really make life better for you at some point in time.\n\nI've always loved characters who can survive a lot of problems, and one of the great ways of living is to make an art that works if necessary\u2014sometimes it works better the more it's made you. When looking at this for my character, I decided my goal would be to make a very long-term story I could live out on my own, where any problems that might come up would just make them easier for myself and everyone I work with. In other words, instead of playing around with these problems when you are going through tough decisions, you might try to be an empathetic storyteller about them.\n\nIf you're trying something out, don't bother worrying too much about having to wait. It's a good thing you're not going to get bored with it. When you get bored though, you can put in some form of effort that'll make it worth your while to improve over time to better serve yourself better.\n\nYou might not like taking the time to improve, but you'll help it. A character that makes you want to be better and more likelier to have it happen is one that would really be a great fit for you.

{"id":703,"ended":true,"length":533,"gen_text":"Red Eye, where I live in South Australia.\n\nI've got the same issues, I am married to a woman who loves us. I never get tired of seeing everyone that's really excited about a film, and I think that's okay.\n\nI was once called 'Godzilla' and when the film was screened at the Australian Screen Awards I was shocked at how much I loved it. Then I actually became a fan myself, and have been getting really into the movies ever since. There's a very unique atmosphere with Marvel on TV and films like that, but it's kind of the normal state of affairs for people. I'm not a racist.\n\nWhat can you tell us about our upbringing in the UK with the idea that we can influence people's attitude to films, and the new releases?\n\nWe are, there's so much stuff we have taken from our TV, so some of the stuff we've done recently has been made by other artists. We've really pushed the boundaries for what should be a film, like the movie of the future or a film that you can see next year, where the world might even be moving in your direction, which is so important right now.\n\nThe other thing we did with 'Godzilla' was the film was so much more political, and we wanted to take that into a more positive world. It was that the idea that we could change the world and change the way it feels and feel, and we're just doing that? If we could change the way people feel about film by taking it into a more mainstream and interesting light and bringing it back into an older light, people would feel less at ease about film in general. I didn't think that was the right fit for our project. We had to make that movie for different types of people over a longer period of time.\n\nI am so grateful for the support of the people that have been helping me out. The people who have said help and help me through the hardest times at home.\n\nI would like to thank all the people who make sure I am doing what I am, you people, and working hard in this industry.

{"id":2718,"ended":true,"length":538,"gen_text":"Write a story that seems incredibly exciting or horrifying at first, but ends up being very anti-climactic and exciting over time. If you're new to the field of superhero comics and need to jump in, read this: I'm also an unabashed gamer.\n\n5. I'm not a fan of the idea that people have to be forced to become superhero creators or that all characters and worlds have to be comic book superheroes. For me, what's cool about this is that there's no arbitrary limit to the number of people you have to write stories for. In other words: If you're a dude who's doing Marvel or DC for $20,000, you'll be writing the books\u2014and if you want your stories to feel superlative, you'll probably need to do it in your living room or anywhere else possible (as long as it's really your parents, your family, or your best friends). It's also easier to work with and help out, because everyone will have some form of access to the comics and make them part of your world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat's not to say that I don't personally love the concept of superheroes, although it's very unlikely I'll use them in stories to write. I'm just not sure which will work best in the medium now that I'm young enough to get my hands on these kinds of stuff, and I don't know what my life's going to be like in two days. I could never live as effectively without the freedom of a self-made comic book like I will at least a little bit of time without using them in my stories\u2014which is a shame because I feel like I could have so much fun writing this stuff.\n\nNow, I'm not a hardcore superhero fanatic\u2014I don't think I have that much time (as long as I'm playing a game). I'm still pretty young, maybe just about 10, so I'm pretty comfortable working with this kind of thing with kids. I'd be naive to think any story will work like this, especially when used at an early age. But when I write a story, I want to avoid writing it too late. This isn't to say that any of my stories aren't awesome. I'm not a comic book fan and I'd gladly work with any story I write and try to keep it fresh, but we're not looking to be out to be seen by people who are less creative or less smart than we are, so I think I would gladly use it for this kind of story.\n\nIf you are interested in going to Comic-Con after the convention, I can always come by our booth near the front of the table to hang out with all of our awesome comics writers (especially Greg Kintorek!).","token_len":566,"entropy":[4.0641,5.7875,3.0791,6.4987,8.7175,5.1158,2.4756,6.8895,3.5963,1.7382,1.2819,1.7939,5.5408,0.314,1.4864,3.7899,9.6538,0.0256,3.8004,0.0201,0.1628,1.8827,4.9185,4.9056,0.2034,0.2513,3.5655,0.5176,1.4869,3.8129,0.2005,1.7226,4.3795,0.717,4.768,0.7522,2.1685,5.0676,1.414,4.5324,1.8622,1.1685,3.3406,1.9267,3.5393,4.4072,1.608,5.9573,2.9786,3.8975,0.0026,6.1245,1.1951,1.6723,0.0023,5.2007,0.5667,4.1226,1.5229,2.1333,1.3824,1.741,0.1087,2.1887,3.7582,1.7409,4.053,3.2638,0.9665,2.1672,4.906,0.247,4.9755,4.1977,4.3856,3.4354,2.2399,4.7787,4.4549,4.3104,5.3152,1.8626,0.1413,0.5303,5.8773,1.0812,2.7077,0.3316,4.9325,1.3277,0.1674,4.8858,2.0506,3.6639,0.2473,2.231,1.2379,0.2288,2.5805,0.9793,1.7506,5.6672,3.088,0.531,2.1071,1.1202,0.0589,2.3569,2.5674,3.95,0.2555,3.5656,3.1427,0.6054,0.4484,3.6474,3.1531,0.0297,2.9827,2.7231,0.4206,1.2618,1.2544,6.0868,1.1459,1.9836,4.49,6.1696,3.8879,0.3053,4.9424,2.7578,2.721,0.7934,0.8728,0.7631,0.8452,3.5708,1.5833,2.0526,3.7248,5.0756,6.334,1.5607,2.6581,0.0676,3.3437,4.7407,2.0915,0.1259,4.0219,5.2488,5.4354,0.0524,0.6964,0.7447,0.9094,2.9456,2.5852,0.2769,2.5633,1.6253,2.0916,2.6531,4.3104,0.0453,2.2791,5.165,1.0814,7.0732,4.5108,4.1913,1.0184,0.0066,2.0885,0.354,4.8839,6.1615,5.6924,2.3538,3.2066,3.3486,0.4429,1.166,1.2807,4.8822,1.6281,0.7761,3.7652,0.3507,2.9006,5.3688,0.4692,3.9891,0.9153,3.589,4.4822,1.9904,3.0519,1.5055,4.643,3.7321,2.1232,4.519,4.4405,0.0049,4.7431,0.1745,1.8405,3.551,2.4429,5.2389,2.3318,4.9862,0.0033,1.6108,3.7876,0.4943,0.6152,0.0002,2.8654,0.1996,0.0002,5.2835,1.3386,2.4866,0.3296,0.0332,0.6598,2.7271,1.1949,0.0002,6.0574,2.009,1.5849,2.9489,0.1603,2.101,1.2992,4.9578,1.8656,0.6356,4.701,3.7674,2.0531,1.3196,5.2074,1.022,1.4871,4.0624,5.0088,3.5867,1.7514,1.4328,1.8052,2.2665,0.7299,1.355,5.5133,4.6655,1.3624,0.6549,3.2356,1.7161,2.6205,6.9754,1.0686,1.181,0.9499,5.5472,1.7454,0.231,3.383,2.2437,0.3388,0.0575,3.993,3.0817,0.0008,3.2539,2.2238,0.8047,1.1355,2.0872,0.0003,1.5349,1.766,3.5439,4.9788,3.0007,0.7025,0.0018,0.3885,0.0194,2.0272,4.5584,5.7653,0.5907,1.8999,4.6735,4.6997,5.0285,4.8439,6.4343,3.7414,2.3053,4.626,1.3355,2.7468,5.6216,0.0262,1.9607,2.5759,0.2608,6.2911,3.0784,6.2239,4.3425,3.9362,3.1675,3.4502,0.2628,1.9604,1.0387,4.6263,4.6462,1.7378,1.9457,0.8117,1.7042,3.5888,3.2495,1.0988,2.2028,3.2834,1.145,1.0324,4.2997,0.5422,1.1187,2.8206,2.2252,5.656,0.2628,0.5708,1.7908,4.7604,2.1711,1.6406,0.9873,0.0002,5.9967,0.6598,1.4404,1.2976,0.6374,2.4084,5.3128,1.5125,5.1519,2.8702,0.7139,2.5477,0.0004,2.0278,1.1959,3.0875,3.7871,1.0073,2.2611,4.7452,4.6123,2.8512,0.004,0.2254,0.9724,4.9853,2.6182,2.2905,3.4362,1.5138,1.6232,3.9987,2.8667,3.2807,0.7323,5.2716,3.5196,3.0538,3.0469,1.0801,1.9754,0.629,1.3506,2.7129,3.3867,4.0103,0.5655,3.2951,1.4529,0.0006,1.7685,5.6143,5.2074,1.2898,1.5049,3.6165,2.3141,5.7221,0.2669,0.3629,5.352,5.3117,3.6095,2.2063,3.8961,0.6919,1.1777,2.6161,2.3757,6.2333,4.5845,3.1693,0.8007,0.0574,0.8386,1.1253,4.0949,0.8802,4.5693,1.848,0.8992,1.4883,0.3847,1.8446,0.5903,5.8856,3.6962,2.0153,3.3716,2.2367,1.3904,4.1853,2.8196,0.0005,1.7956,0.0599,0.4702,4.4619,1.1408,1.5104,1.4135,2.1989,0.0002,3.2003,1.9316,1.0266,1.6603,1.5535,2.2187,3.8798,0.2544,1.1443,3.3003,0.5981,4.2402,4.9869,3.3534,0.3091,2.2201,1.621,1.1077,3.6308,3.9465,3.8559,0.206,3.2063,0.7697,2.621,2.2707,1.3873,5.5909,1.3905,2.2144,5.0493,0.9066,3.0046,5.9281,3.6405,3.5926,4.6554,2.4232,3.15,0.8021,2.0833,4.5946,5.4276,2.2483,2.2973,5.0069,0.7895,1.0354,0.5001,2.9079,1.7776,1.2023,2.9976,2.7238,3.7677,5.2534,4.2737,3.0152,2.3549,4.3333,1.8261,0.0009,2.9007,0.5569,0.6178,0.0002,4.1195,0.396,4.1899,1.7608,0.0848,5.312,1.7284,2.3267,0.6846,0.0109,6.437,1.852,2.5374,0.4923,2.2813,3.6099,3.2762,3.5842,2.2199,6.0514,0.4797,4.9775,2.1266,2.6487,1.3303,0.1171,5.771,1.5485,3.2694,0.1306,0.9302,4.4457,1.0053,1.6994,4.3742,2.6638,3.0757,3.447,4.4521,5.8154,4.6672,4.5055,2.1383,0.6866,5.3712]}

{"id":1870,"ended":true,"length":535,"gen_text":"Civilisation as we know it suddenly ends on the first of september of year 2015. Humankind has completely vanished from the face of the Earth. Write an alien's archeologist report on our civilisation.\n\nIn fact, in the year since those brave few who risked their lives to free our people have been forced to flee into the cold darkness of the wilderness, the Earth's climate has not altered as much since humans once inhabited it.\n\nWith this we are now ready to live and live on the planet.\n\nIt is a wonder what might have happened if you had not gone to the North Pole in the year 2000 or the year 3000. This new era has been set up by aliens that are intent on dominating planet space but for which we are still completely ignorant with no knowledge about human history. If you do not want to read about what a monster that is, then you will have to come here from some other planet.\n\nIn recent years, when we were talking about the history of what humanity could think, people of our size and power have now taken to referring to the future as the 'Dark Ages. We have become more enlightened, smarter and freer in this new era. It is as if humanity had arrived at such a time, that it had become our current situation. Our world is being completely ruined by one of the most brutal and destructive species on the Earth right now.\n\nThe next five years will be a dark one. You may find yourself at the end of the Earth's life expectancy of 80 years (the latest time is 20.8 years as of this week).\n\nWhat will happen to us and for how long will we live? And when? If we don't get out, then our future lies in the hands of another human and their descendants who will try to destroy us at the beginning of the next century.\n\nBut don't worry! If we keep taking these risks then we might even live a long time before the time when humanity will be wiped out over again. In other words, there will be little to see here when it comes to the future, if you leave the past.\n\nIn any event, if you want to follow the 'Dark Ages,' then the only way you can save the world isn't with some kind of illegal alien agenda, you can start right now.\n\nThis article was written by James B.

{"id":2214,"ended":true,"length":534,"gen_text":"A generation ago humanity faced an extinction level catastrophe. In response, the world's governments lifted all legal, moral, and ethical bans on scientific research in a desperate attempt to overcome the danger. You now live in a world dealing with the consequences of this.\n\nHowever, that did not stop human history from spiraling out of control. As human history spiraled out of control, the world's governments raised their voices to call for action.\n\nThis wasn't done quickly with those who would dare to argue that science's ultimate goal and'science's ultimate agenda lie in the pursuit of scientific advancement. Science is human science and it is what drives the human race. We have been there. This new era has brought with it some of the largest and most destructive disasters on Earth for any human since the creation of life itself. A human's survival against any or all of these destructive storms is a survival sacrifice that can only be made with our own ingenuity. It means that we can never have a future where our'science' is a waste of our humanity. As far as science is concerned, it ain't coming.\n\nHowever, some of the key elements of scientific progress. It turns out science is about the things that make us feel good. Research on new worlds, experiments, and breakthroughs has made life easier. And as scientists, we can put ourselves in better circumstances.\n\nScience has revealed that most humans can experience change only by taking action, regardless of our or their peers knowledge. Science gives us ways to find meaning, to understand the life we take for granted. The only thing that can change that isn't science is action.\n\nWhat will happen to us if we can only choose and take responsibility for our actions? Does science offer no guidance and only serve the selfish greed of people on our planet?\n\nIn my book The New Science, I describe the many'science's ways in which I am 'taking care of the planet\n\nA global government may attempt to protect the interests of large corporations and groups by enforcing policies that hurt the individual, instead of protecting the planet's people. In the book's end summary, I will describe how I believe this will help 'the free world.\n\nIf I could take something away from my own life, it would be that I could take away something about the world you 'l be concerned about. That is why I advocate 'taking care of the planet's people.\n\nIf I wanted to stop the killing of people over. That is what science's goals mean. We humans need to learn how to take it away. That is the only way to learn this powerful lesson.\n\nIf we live out long enough, they will take over us.\n\nWe can take care of our own world by following science.","token_len":568,"entropy":[9.5898,1.7537,9.5947,5.0955,2.5017,3.5623,4.7311,5.9628,1.1476,3.3493,4.7735,1.0308,1.7602,3.0615,2.023,4.1596,6.9762,3.3888,5.2275,5.0372,3.9795,1.1319,0.561,2.5125,5.1716,0.2209,6.6336,0.8995,3.1592,4.3037,3.4227,1.3166,0.0097,6.0254,0.794,5.2755,1.0674,7.5368,5.3472,2.8893,0.3229,0.6953,0.8575,9.1875,0.0298,2.2221,3.6338,0.1148,2.3983,4.4754,1.4568,0.0013,4.7046,0.1001,4.6953,4.5172,0.0262,1.4122,5.2827,3.8017,0.2135,4.1448,0.2174,0.5271,0.0217,0.003,0.3869,3.4071,4.1204,0.5093,2.7627,0.3707,0.1233,0.0297,0.006,0.2768,1.8168,2.2002,1.3139,1.215,4.1487,2.2003,2.6792,1.8414,4.2073,0.2688,3.9708,0.7757,2.6139,0.0002,3.6109,5.4315,0.0006,5.1764,5.4241,6.0912,5.4736,1.2528,3.516,3.9086,0.7531,4.5917,1.0142,2.0976,5.2518,5.2038,1.3387,5.6806,10.1061,14.1602,5.662,2.4391,5.8669,4.7311,0.7083,1.4941,2.3772,0.0201,3.546,2.5006,0.4216,3.8212,1.7347,5.0412,3.9544,2.1087,1.9733,1.094,5.0455,3.6302,2.3863,1.9244,0.7667,0.6945,3.6234,2.6407,2.7928,4.1585,1.4974,4.441,5.8859,2.5793,2.6244,2.3712,2.1594,0.0089,3.7405,1.8379,0.2294,5.4824,2.2142,0.2333,2.8078,5.1472,2.2413,1.47,5.0196,4.8507,1.5067,5.568,0.6263,3.7838,0.0323,3.2233,2.4412,0.1876,5.3465,4.8286,4.3041,3.6836,4.7429,5.1698,5.3325,0.0385,0.3768,0.6284,3.2876,3.4592,1.0065,1.8805,4.2769,5.8576,2.2157,3.3914,0.8414,0.2147,1.3238,2.2003,3.694,2.4589,3.3518,0.9961,3.6883,4.5265,1.5752,1.2586,2.0764,3.7986,3.1412,1.9933,2.0499,1.7597,2.5782,12.0187,5.6999,7.3501,2.1064,3.4999,7.4348,0.1753,1.5279,4.8692,0.7716,4.8063,5.1175,0.0365,2.6314,0.8295,0.0003,0.1581,1.9149,6.7373,0.0039,4.1189,1.7864,0.789,0.0002,4.9397,0.0455,5.0081,1.5466,1.1708,6.4157,3.3956,0.5291,3.375,1.5118,6.3631,3.9014,6.3533,0.1316,3.6764,0.9209,4.3854,3.0453,4.2941,0.6148,2.0627,1.0264,4.0958,0.5964,0.9889,6.0492,2.6537,5.3378,5.1664,1.4763,5.6782,1.0159,1.0505,4.3433,0.3945,3.1229,3.3675,3.6348,2.2805,2.9584,3.4745,3.2733,3.0513,1.4625,0.2475,1.779,5.4542,2.7464,0.8267,3.8379,4.2353,1.2822,1.6743,0.0002,2.6309,2.1844,5.4672,1.6764,5.0865,3.8021,3.2545,5.0001,5.4606,5.578,2.2373,3.6223,1.2025,3.0627,4.795,0.0136,3.0749,5.3943,1.9963,4.8801,6.0433,0.8943,2.8496,4.798,0.3382,5.5762,0.3053,4.7321,3.9802,1.8378,1.6987,2.3965,2.1272,6.0847,2.086,5.0405,0.0819,0.0047,0.8003,3.5997,3.7415,2.0338,0.9283,1.7463,2.3078,3.7627,4.9785,0.0008,1.5377,0.947,1.1018,0.149,0.8658,0.0002,4.2077,4.1139,1.7338,1.6026,2.0009,0.7999,0.4784,4.3363,3.3119,3.7068,5.2474,3.3702,4.941,0.3805,0.5161,0.6915,0.3711,6.108,2.0254,4.0023,4.2319,3.6954,3.2755,3.672,4.7588,2.802,4.0816,4.6867,0.3263,4.4197,4.4629,3.4824,1.3865,0.5123,1.5141,0.0002,3.4065,3.46,1.8927,2.5833,4.2991,2.4744,0.8703,0.7073,3.7626,1.2007,3.9791,10.3806,11.281,4.3967,5.3254,1.9932,0.4767,5.4666,3.6246,7.4431,4.3933,3.4736,0.3849,2.0247,1.6116,7.3467,0.0002,4.3253,6.0092,4.15,5.0646,5.1641,0.0468,3.9955,1.5197,3.4147,0.0367,5.3085,0.666,1.8766,5.8277,2.7548,5.0,3.6706,0.7628,5.6612,1.267,4.7344,1.8177,5.8579,0.0468,2.0455,0.6702,0.9588,2.7051,3.7108,0.5323,3.0359,2.2091,4.5271,2.6936,4.0227,5.8245,0.1817,0.8993,5.0931,3.0553,1.2945,2.8402,3.1735,2.2982,2.2891,3.9478,5.673,1.7482,6.5312,1.1667,4.8079,1.5168,0.0001,3.8178,2.75,3.3505,3.1082,5.9387,1.7559,0.0809,2.2345,1.9908,1.3092,0.6118,1.7809,0.188,0.1037,1.9084,0.7189,2.4383,1.9685,1.2093,3.4117,5.4063,2.2883,1.2535,5.9563,7.6478,5.3362,5.6094,2.7161,0.2092,0.3418,3.2639,1.3333,2.5698,0.4539,5.3108,3.9554,1.9092,0.3773,0.1364,0.3358,0.1559,4.8243,0.3824,2.1403,0.9166,0.0002,2.8876,0.9827,4.7267,0.1525,4.1756,1.5483,4.8473,0.3672,2.6167,6.0897,8.9073,4.4407,0.2816,1.8463,3.3243,5.1496,5.0865,5.2125,0.5512,3.3536,3.6293,2.7081,0.3679,4.1203,1.9192,0.0474,2.3431,5.8872,2.2395,1.0429,3.1206,0.3185,2.9716,2.0174,0.3788,1.0724,5.3065,5.3465,5.8722,1.097,0.6246,0.4808,0.0002,2.5323,1.8329,5.5489,5.5205,7.4802,0.2549,0.8943,5.6497,0.4122,3.5696,1.6654,4.0349,0.6241,1.7211,0.0003,3.4247,2.4957,2.4734,1.678,0.0299,1.7465,0.9739,4.3176,2.6295,4.2408,1.8963,2.0647]}

After fleeing Richmond's Rapture, you honestly have no idea what's happening in your new home : Queens, New York.\n\n' The apocalypse ended the way I'd expected... You can't really say what's going on with this place' But let me give you the facts, and that's the best one: Your family and friends are on the run.\n\n'I saw [your parents'] car and when the cops arrived, they told them they weren't allowed to visit us,' says J.W., 'And it was just like that. The cops were always so aggressive, screaming, 'Oh look, you've been here for a long time, we've seen you with your car! Can you come in please! We love you!'.\n\n'They said they didn't like you and you're trying to talk us out of them, but it's really your parents, your dad, your grandfather.'\n\nI can never imagine someone getting so angry with us\n\nJ.W. said the police have been very aggressive throughout the shooting, even when he wasn't holding them accountable.\n\n'They said they were not allowed to visit us' and that your parents are very worried for your safety, the cop said. 'They did say: 'you're so scary right now. Your parents are scared for you, what if you get shot?' the cop continued.\n\n'The officer then explained that the cops had called you two days before, when that incident happened. He told you you were trying to convince the cops to come out, and if he did, you could go to prison if necessary.'\n\nNow, the cop says his words on the ground are completely truthful. I feel very confident at my age that the authorities are in the right place at the right time to take my life, J.W..\n\n'The police officer was so forceful, and everyone was yelling, \"Look, I just shoot you for shooting me. If you come here now, you won't be arrested or charged. I'll have you prosecuted and put you in handcuffs until you can go home,'\" the cop said\n\nA post shared by @JW_Porter_on Twitter (@jwporter) on Aug 8, 2017 at 5:35pm PDT\n\nEven so, for some people living in Brooklyn, if the cops had come to our home to arrest us, we would be in handcuffs today. As a community, we should not wait until they found some guns to fight for our rights to live.\n\nIf you are living in one of Brooklyn's large middle class neighborhoods, chances are, you're at least comfortable with my advice.","token_len":569,"entropy":[11.6834,5.6226,2.1794,1.9871,5.191,0.0342,1.5076,1.4494,6.1015,5.9003,1.7517,0.9277,2.7827,3.4791,6.5058,7.2725,0.5234,5.4917,3.3037,0.9578,6.1434,8.9016,10.503,4.8547,7.9367,0.1186,0.7767,2.961,12.9979,2.6615,0.245,0.2059,0.5888,1.6559,2.5601,1.5313,2.162,4.832,2.0327,11.9756,11.7571,0.9482,2.0867,0.0896,2.4049,1.9477,0.1125,7.2722,4.291,2.7296,5.8674,4.3468,2.7877,2.5893,2.7205,2.1419,5.1171,6.14,2.6654,1.0459,3.6,2.9562,2.6233,1.5184,1.0811,0.6935,3.0392,2.4766,2.8803,4.7987,6.7608,5.8361,1.8178,2.9658,0.0798,2.9892,5.1701,2.6362,2.2953,4.1372,0.3459,2.3934,3.1752,3.4855,2.4464,5.7184,4.0202,2.6024,0.7368,1.273,4.2898,0.8157,2.4995,1.8251,2.2145,0.0005,2.7845,4.0932,4.8322,6.1509,2.2696,2.6795,1.8939,2.5792,3.074,5.8976,3.7524,2.3834,1.5978,1.1905,1.0107,2.9254,1.7898,1.922,3.8678,0.0008,2.0513,0.3141,5.9255,3.2037,4.5461,2.0424,6.1513,2.4766,3.7943,3.0695,2.1748,3.7324,3.8317,0.8639,2.6896,1.8687,3.7061,1.106,3.1825,1.3138,1.8296,5.3565,3.5932,3.6821,1.5946,5.5154,1.6359,0.8989,4.7201,5.3773,0.9649,1.8413,3.1423,1.9684,2.3274,1.4347,1.9546,1.0481,0.0635,1.348,2.7435,1.5785,2.5275,1.4513,5.5658,0.6877,2.8797,2.9102,5.582,0.5603,2.8416,1.8108,5.8501,4.6217,1.6543,5.1126,0.1063,1.7258,6.2579,1.2254,0.0003,0.3835,2.3543,2.5357,2.1522,2.6379,0.0004,3.9074,2.6358,2.5696,1.816,2.6574,5.1898,0.0216,4.6678,3.6968,0.7549,0.0319,6.0658,1.1952,0.801,2.9638,1.5343,3.5185,5.5722,2.3429,2.2513,2.7427,3.1356,0.873,1.7797,3.5888,3.6692,0.2959,0.0004,4.5904,3.4451,4.9749,2.8996,5.9279,3.9483,2.4575,1.9344,2.5386,4.2099,5.058,0.0002,2.2316,0.2409,0.0229,0.2928,4.1782,2.7518,2.0428,4.3163,1.4642,3.2422,2.7609,4.9701,0.5683,6.0249,1.2234,3.4906,2.71,2.5213,3.498,0.001,5.6638,2.7766,1.9681,0.5497,0.5078,0.0004,0.2427,1.3586,3.5554,0.9282,3.2015,3.0352,1.6573,0.0969,1.4098,0.28,4.9388,2.1553,2.4881,5.7038,1.1376,1.6329,5.4271,3.644,2.9475,1.8168,0.1776,1.1962,5.0449,5.5374,0.8927,0.3539,1.4661,1.2484,4.7086,1.9316,6.7379,0.3034,5.2789,0.7639,4.5402,4.7033,5.4063,0.0487,1.8565,3.8639,1.1323,0.7893,1.9417,1.5043,1.7472,1.6824,5.0995,2.7576,0.9641,1.8631,0.9373,1.1359,6.466,0.2582,2.8461,0.1675,0.5717,0.0003,0.5648,3.3964,4.6358,4.6413,4.4103,1.2584,2.717,2.7119,2.5055,4.3624,3.4517,4.4197,2.1249,0.8719,1.6142,3.9801,6.8668,4.7203,0.5283,1.5179,1.9797,2.5073,1.0023,2.7559,1.3377,4.7537,0.0189,5.469,2.2138,0.6075,0.9831,1.9225,3.3646,1.788,1.4337,4.0083,4.8535,2.9875,0.9755,1.3731,2.9203,2.6064,1.5992,4.3219,3.7368,8.3944,1.0979,0.1117,0.0003,5.2452,1.4285,2.8295,2.4701,1.6762,2.6697,5.207,6.2121,0.9012,4.2774,1.2061,4.9523,4.2694,0.7571,5.6932,4.6128,3.5936,3.6007,5.9595,4.2617,2.4965,1.4297,2.5386,5.4928,1.3641,4.2789,1.7952,0.2887,0.7319,0.834,0.1704,0.0323,0.0483,2.166,2.7746,3.3178,1.0916,1.9634,3.5851,0.014,0.006,6.8766,1.0947,0.0005,0.6565,2.651,1.705,4.2712,2.5679,3.4236,4.8653,1.4875,2.1612,6.1542,1.2671,3.9493,1.7885,3.1216,4.9805,1.2967,2.9878,4.4771,5.4561,0.3776,4.5533,3.9085,2.359,2.3518,4.2354,0.4377,3.4507,2.8401,3.2954,0.3681,1.2673,3.8733,0.0016,0.9918,2.7935,3.5039,0.9963,1.7216,2.441,1.8694,4.1268,0.9124,4.7558,2.745,3.1811,0.7837,0.7108,4.5287,3.6513,0.6926,2.1654,1.7821,1.1006,2.8528,2.0934,0.2499,0.7673,3.7532,0.0003,4.6352,5.7324,0.1359,0.0003,4.0657,3.6003,0.9125,1.5209,4.8869,4.627,2.7144,5.2163,3.1505,0.3932,0.5842,0.576,0.676,1.7947,0.0007,2.2581,3.752,0.001,0.2827,0.0001,2.5214,0.0025,4.0868,0.3966,0.001,0.0982,0.0003,6.226,3.946,0.0393,5.6384,3.1958,2.326,6.3604,0.4368,4.3936,0.4174,6.0226,2.4207,1.4495,3.5899,2.6643,1.3548,3.7785,1.8155,2.9458,2.4177,0.765,0.6549,1.4564,0.8895,1.8688,2.0414,2.4628,4.158,0.595,5.2205,2.2138,4.6572,0.4979,0.4343,3.9188,2.3544,5.8529,2.1336,2.0222,4.8466,5.239,5.0041,1.2401,4.6519,2.0607,1.6136,1.354,3.3268,1.7283,2.4107,0.6244,0.0003,4.3268,1.2739,2.4136,2.713,0.27,4.6645,0.0425,1.9149,0.0837,5.9111,5.6729,0.9615,0.3598,0.4644,3.976,0.0046,2.5695,0.8257,2.8773,4.5097,0.6786,5.7414,0.7183,6.1662,4.5036,1.0731]}
{"id":2494,"ended":true,"length":523,"gen_text":"Why is Waldo hiding?\n\nWaldo was in the kitchen when she went missing. During the incident, he was seen carrying a suitcase filled with food. On Nov. 20, 1996, a group of police officers were called to the building using an AK-47 rifle. He was taken to a local hospital and died. He was discovered by firemen who reported that he had shot himself.\n\nThe officers were questioned but no one was arrested. The day before his death, the two witnesses were identified as Eveline and Michael Zeevy. They said that Waldo told them about a friend, the father of a young baby girl, who had gone missing with Waldo. One of the police report said that he told them about Eveline and told them that she lived in the apartment complex near the restaurant where he lived. As part of their investigation, they found out that Waldo had been seen outside some of the apartments, possibly with Eveline, the report said.\n\nWaldo's mother wrote her daughter on Twitter. Eveline responded by asking about Waldo:\n\nHey, I'm a little old for this one. I feel like this is the most boring way to say this to your son. It's not what you say, it's the way this man behaves. I am really sad I got the same reaction over and over again. I could never live as well without you. Go over and look at the video you made. Go to your place and go eat the food you ate. Thank God, I don't have a lot of friends you're so nice. Tell this man how nice I am. I am your brother and you'll never let anyone tell I am your brother. I love my life. No one's a fool. Go over and try for something real. I'm going to love it.\n\nWaldo's mother also released a message saying that she's still looking for information about Waldo:\n\nToday's news, about how he left his mother's home, and the girl's murder, brings the family a lot of grief. The only explanation I wish you a happy birthday is if you can put his family through the hardest one right now. If you can explain how you think this happened, I want to thank you all for believing in me.\n\nWaldo's sister, T.L., told The Chronicle that she \"was very sad for her sister because someone needs to be held accountable for what he did\".

{"id":2090,"ended":true,"length":548,"gen_text":"For 24 hours not one violent crime occurs anywhere in New York City. ( Inspired by a front page TIL ) Why? Because it makes one more in the City to commit the crime. The Crime\n\nThe fact is that crime is up for grabs in New York City. There are 1 million criminals per year living in New York City but there are hundreds of thousand more that make it onto the crime victim list. If we take the FBI's report on NYC and apply what he has to claim, 1 million criminals per year were actually in the city last year. As we can see above from the above map of crime data the US has the highest concentration on crimes for any major city.\n\nAnd according to the Crime Trends report, there is more crime per person in New York City than ever before. So the average resident falls into the Crime Victim Rates range. In other words, when your crime is increasing and is driving traffic up, it increases, and crime in a city increases.\n\nWhile crime is up in New York City, it is down in the District alone. In any given city, there are about 18,000 less crime than there are people in the average American household.\n\nThe most common reason New Yorkers are falling victim to gang violence is due to the cost of transportation (the loss of people to crime) but is also due to their income, unemployment, the low wages and lack of social services.\n\nThe crime rate is also higher in New York City. The U.S. has more crime that it incarcerates than it does in any other country and it is about five times more dangerous in New York City, nearly three times the rate it is in New Jersey and more than three times the rate it is in the District.\n\nThe real problem we've had in New York is that if we do not put an end to gang violence, we will lead the nation in increasing the rate of violent crime. In other words, instead of increasing the rates per 100 people, we should put an end to gang violence.\n\nBecause we have more people per year in New York City than ever before.\n\nOf course if you did not increase the crimes that New Yorkers commit, we would not be able to prevent the rise of crime in NYC. When you do increase those crimes, the crime rate for New York can be just as high, but we will not stop there. I do want to make sure we do not forget the real problem: that there, in New York City, is a high level of crime that is driving up the rate of crime. That is why I am saying that we should increase the number of people who commit violent crimes. We can do that. We can control all of these crimes that we would not have prevented the rise of crime in NYC.","token_len":571,"entropy":[8.1047,0.6574,9.0572,3.9634,10.1316,1.692,6.1311,7.6091,0.6282,3.9467,0.5583,0.3924,0.8047,4.588,14.9131,0.0687,2.6335,9.507,0.5455,8.7789,7.5941,4.7367,6.7087,2.4107,0.8731,2.5134,3.9729,5.5907,2.6643,5.2346,1.4081,5.1948,4.3105,4.0434,3.0812,0.619,0.9473,2.9535,4.5421,5.1843,0.0079,2.7318,5.8006,1.5574,0.8087,3.1244,1.0125,4.1711,4.1701,0.5093,1.2199,0.9246,0.0031,0.1594,0.5963,3.5351,0.4883,4.5648,3.2475,4.9057,2.886,0.5665,4.3558,0.2265,1.3629,0.0028,0.1729,5.6497,2.1288,0.349,5.2018,0.4884,3.4504,0.7261,2.7445,4.3618,2.1976,3.6103,0.3653,4.4673,5.6422,0.6177,0.7774,4.172,2.3493,2.7092,1.4942,5.5086,0.7662,4.3865,1.4214,4.6386,3.0914,4.044,5.9252,5.6305,2.2093,1.2888,5.5487,1.7287,4.8015,2.1512,2.3709,2.1406,0.0251,5.0789,4.273,3.1729,1.2118,1.1209,3.6013,0.0538,0.6152,4.7796,2.9623,2.2406,0.0705,3.8019,4.421,0.7879,3.7776,3.9114,2.6738,1.5387,3.225,4.3082,5.9225,2.2188,1.9678,0.9433,4.01,5.5003,3.9578,4.1886,3.8453,1.8341,0.7538,1.0691,1.8262,0.0022,4.0686,5.3627,0.0088,1.082,3.2166,5.4074,3.0738,1.741,2.5935,1.4501,3.649,0.9856,2.1672,2.9237,0.8228,0.8964,0.0039,0.3567,0.3663,3.7043,0.1268,0.4038,3.7406,3.1221,4.8502,4.8587,6.4865,1.9676,0.7305,5.6803,3.363,8.086,1.9294,1.2335,3.6111,1.9911,0.0087,0.6806,4.1328,5.2576,3.0096,2.6295,5.0113,3.204,4.402,5.6129,4.2395,4.5576,1.2897,1.8534,4.5016,4.1157,1.7756,3.3,3.5518,4.0837,1.2855,2.3056,0.4275,1.1173,0.0003,5.0177,3.1533,1.2859,0.9704,1.5001,0.7278,0.0021,0.1425,0.9376,1.3932,0.5417,0.8681,0.2578,1.7193,4.2107,7.6265,0.201,2.4116,5.858,0.9879,2.2413,1.1214,1.1366,0.3112,3.2336,4.7357,0.7306,0.3936,5.1385,2.4212,1.1602,2.1306,0.6338,1.6797,0.8209,0.8113,4.7337,2.5559,2.4989,0.2299,1.5389,0.0002,2.4971,5.0824,1.5874,2.098,5.2598,0.6373,1.7169,4.2676,1.5089,0.1479,6.9569,0.538,0.2387,2.8148,0.0281,1.501,5.9316,0.1508,4.4394,4.0577,2.9638,6.0478,0.0359,4.7783,1.5175,2.4256,2.0883,4.1628,5.6989,1.2397,0.7666,0.0388,4.7605,5.5451,2.5923,4.8041,0.7977,4.015,4.4773,2.3502,2.4163,2.299,0.0025,3.3079,1.1028,0.3581,1.0156,0.0002,2.2046,4.4139,1.2202,1.8891,2.3061,2.6876,0.4221,2.4254,0.0772,0.2633,2.2672,1.9468,5.7822,0.0259,0.0109,0.0555,2.3308,3.6125,1.6753,5.4163,1.866,5.6617,0.0051,1.46,1.9489,1.0949,0.6059,0.6699,0.1527,1.6113,3.4229,2.5109,0.7957,4.8971,4.9934,0.0345,1.508,2.1661,2.2694,0.8143,0.0027,0.1692,4.1541,5.8688,2.2502,0.0181,2.0829,1.6756,2.4368,0.3356,0.1214,3.9259,1.4743,1.7162,2.5306,0.1553,2.28,0.0047,0.5563,0.0806,0.1391,0.0212,0.0262,2.0046,1.3627,0.8156,0.3792,0.0002,2.1154,5.0662,1.7728,5.2062,5.1267,3.0109,1.2367,0.7815,0.0049,2.8369,1.0668,4.9007,0.9949,3.2226,0.5793,4.4594,2.786,0.2795,0.0098,2.0545,0.3472,1.1204,1.0227,0.8067,5.1157,1.321,1.7639,0.4348,3.579,1.0765,3.264,0.1017,2.1228,0.165,0.6583,3.5677,2.4254,0.0011,0.1741,6.3535,0.0107,4.1208,0.7119,3.2847,6.0086,2.2416,3.7231,0.839,0.1684,2.4096,3.0272,0.4999,0.0017,0.0069,1.0616,0.2175,0.9826,0.546,0.0002,5.3647,2.5847,1.8014,3.3292,1.8468,3.2868,3.3831,1.8058,0.3119,0.0033,0.414,0.9905,1.816,0.0163,3.3256,1.6544,0.0002,5.5757,0.183,3.7833,2.3476,5.6654,0.5798,4.047,0.1932,4.952,3.4889,3.3215,0.5173,0.2104,1.0444,2.1447,0.3374,1.185,1.1419,1.5241,0.0059,2.4512,1.5843,2.565,1.0828,0.8163,1.579,3.9751,0.4181,5.6733,1.7048,2.4279,1.8554,5.5182,0.754,0.6019,2.2018,1.8109,0.6163,4.6715,1.3449,0.7897,6.1592,2.6978,5.1534,0.2008,0.2301,2.7994,1.6308,2.9021,2.3625,1.1764,2.4961,2.4789,0.1819,5.548,4.269,3.6864,0.0826,2.7117,2.6974,2.5118,2.1641,0.5857,1.5032,1.8614,3.8852,1.7447,3.6346,2.8199,3.388,7.2668,2.0434,0.6612,0.0065,0.3301,0.1437,1.8096,1.3969,4.7147,2.1043,0.0056,0.8548,1.6957,1.0477,2.7312,1.4886,0.6494,1.7917,0.0607,1.0417,0.718,4.0073,0.6571,0.9425,1.2166,1.2515,4.5299,1.0176,1.3052,1.3269,3.3514,0.3456,2.2637,0.0237,1.6905,1.9079,1.2648,1.5369,0.221,1.3329,2.8709,2.434,1.4451,0.9836,2.2098,1.9886,0.4167,5.3144,5.0802,0.9186,3.1135,1.5116,2.9654,1.6128,4.1604,1.1493,1.6009,2.2327,4.1354,0.2981,0.3895,0.1938,0.5438,1.0447,0.4672]}
{"id":4547,"ended":false,"length":534,"gen_text":"A serial killer's identity has been revealed to the public. However instead of fearing this man, they idolize him.\n\nHowever, in the current year, those who fear him will continue to idolize him.\n\nIn other words, the police and vigilante gangs seem to be the ones who are not bothered by terrorism, but are worried about those who would dare to cross the line and become victims of this terrorist attack.\n\nBut in reality, the police have had enough, so they have gone to find, and even the terrorist who tried to kill one of our members will end up with more than one of his victims.\n\nIt would be better for all criminals to die with impunity. A terrorist attack which happens to be a terrorist attack, with no consequences, is a waste of time, time and resources.\n\nTerrorism is an easy act for criminals to make, and it is a waste of lives.\n\nI have never found someone using terrorism as a metaphor. Just like the criminal mafia of the 1960s.\n\nThey may be the mafia in any number of ways. A mafia that is not in a hurry to commit such crimes.\n\nAnd they don't use terrorism as a metaphor of their political ideology, because the fact that terrorists do not want to commit such crimes, only to get arrested will prove the fact that their enemies are working against the people.\n\nTerrorism is a problem especially for the criminal mafia. The mafia has an agenda. The mafia is planning to use terror violence against people even if it would only harm people at least a little more. It has very high stakes if it is used against a group by a terrorist, and you don't want to mess this up.\n\nNow, I am not a terrorist in the least, but I have been a supporter of the victims of terrorism before, even before I saw this terrorist attack. A large number of victims will die as a direct result of the terrorist attack.\n\nI never even saw this terrorist attack, just wanted to leave a scarlet letter in the grave of my son, not even bothering to read it.\n\nI even decided to write it down once I saw it, so that we won't forget about it. For some time my son will be a victim of terrorism, but soon the terrorist should be stopped and killed.\n\nTerrorism is something that is easy. They only really want to kill people first, not because they want to kill themselves, but because they think that some innocent person will not be killed because they fear that the terrorism will lead them to commit such crimes.\n\nThese things are impossible!\n\nThen our police have to stop this terror attack, and bring it all back to the right place, by doing what the terrorists want them to do!","token_len":571,"entropy":[10.7104,1.5702,3.7574,5.9731,1.478,0.7866,1.4841,2.1232,1.8093,0.8065,1.0232,5.3784,10.4835,0.0457,6.8867,4.8438,4.0276,1.0587,2.4482,11.6845,0.6397,0.4064,1.4634,1.5889,0.0029,5.1266,0.3761,3.3817,1.4789,5.6484,4.9984,0.3598,6.5614,0.694,5.2345,1.1934,2.4128,4.9677,0.1567,4.0626,0.0084,0.347,0.6679,1.1563,0.0004,2.963,3.9603,1.3628,0.0509,2.1901,5.2787,2.8914,5.1296,3.6521,6.3327,0.1171,0.9554,2.7705,1.8467,0.7334,1.5826,4.8771,5.7575,0.6817,7.7636,1.9559,1.7093,1.8516,3.5251,0.4416,5.0062,0.4116,3.5689,3.778,0.3303,4.7405,0.8971,1.9392,2.3801,3.0394,4.7801,0.3103,3.183,3.2862,2.9855,0.1559,0.2587,0.0004,4.1029,3.1184,2.305,0.0873,1.4952,2.1323,2.7657,5.3793,2.1873,2.738,2.9069,0.4944,1.8227,4.4483,2.0587,4.7554,6.05,2.8527,4.5935,4.6177,3.9596,2.1391,4.4367,0.0444,1.1714,4.9165,0.2347,3.9379,3.3524,3.903,4.4826,0.0261,3.4303,4.9098,1.2685,2.3177,3.7743,1.6262,2.1022,0.4282,0.2421,0.0003,3.7191,3.6799,0.7193,3.4108,1.9242,2.6698,5.5943,0.6075,2.0244,3.3563,2.5809,1.3001,6.0251,2.8703,2.031,5.1866,4.3269,1.319,0.723,2.4888,1.8944,0.1938,2.0721,4.5527,1.9142,3.8755,1.3874,1.4991,1.8807,5.1068,0.0481,0.797,1.6998,2.8574,0.9801,2.2416,0.338,0.4331,0.0003,5.0899,0.8557,0.8425,2.8432,5.0955,5.2007,2.8794,2.3097,0.8211,3.9718,1.0213,1.5237,1.8676,0.8073,1.883,2.8707,0.0301,2.8596,0.6235,0.8185,0.0002,4.1406,2.662,3.262,5.188,4.8422,7.0941,2.6857,1.0388,0.3189,6.2898,1.3904,5.61,1.9033,2.0139,5.3218,5.7272,4.1906,1.1438,3.7261,0.267,2.5269,0.5758,0.0002,4.1382,5.3875,1.8998,2.6905,4.5687,3.2018,5.2491,2.6105,0.0312,1.0805,1.3397,4.6985,3.8828,2.718,1.8995,3.1712,4.3502,2.6618,3.2201,0.3867,3.3146,4.7533,2.7127,1.1971,1.2544,0.0002,3.5951,2.1066,4.7212,0.0011,3.6613,1.1142,0.3415,0.2316,0.9036,4.9545,1.8889,5.6395,2.8868,1.7672,2.2459,2.6576,4.5258,0.8539,3.1011,3.4239,1.0913,3.1596,0.1902,1.5056,0.9718,0.439,2.1641,5.1579,2.5935,3.9206,4.4504,5.591,4.4783,2.8394,2.1417,0.3012,3.0659,5.1188,0.7158,5.0853,1.345,3.1574,1.8248,0.7145,0.1091,0.0002,2.2431,0.0953,0.6208,1.2731,4.8558,6.8433,0.8765,1.5051,4.2076,1.1303,1.0919,2.739,2.2017,2.3801,3.8708,2.8915,1.8908,2.2104,1.5639,1.7792,5.3419,1.0888,2.5078,2.4667,6.4746,0.8398,2.5444,5.7433,0.9953,1.1369,4.4817,2.5834,4.4343,3.1186,5.0183,5.1443,1.8577,0.6203,4.5825,0.6599,3.9645,3.2061,5.7944,3.1435,4.5431,5.7368,1.1734,1.1642,1.4954,1.4852,2.8044,2.9206,6.5366,1.4904,2.3878,2.3488,1.5583,5.8577,3.0582,0.0006,1.1767,0.6833,5.8615,4.8213,0.0915,0.6618,0.2226,0.0002,4.9678,0.7374,2.2804,1.8505,0.8593,2.7644,1.6052,5.0005,1.4416,3.9133,0.8848,0.5936,0.6469,2.0162,2.101,2.7282,5.2899,0.0945,1.0954,4.8243,0.2806,1.2873,5.4809,1.2872,3.9326,1.8402,1.4468,3.9467,2.5739,2.6688,0.7133,0.5531,5.694,5.3854,1.3032,0.032,1.9282,4.7391,2.2018,3.5036,0.1283,6.3281,0.0831,0.0435,2.091,1.1953,0.6788,0.517,0.6134,0.0002,2.1438,4.7687,4.2239,1.2967,1.7579,1.1615,0.2916,1.4231,5.2601,6.3034,0.137,5.2895,1.89,5.8966,3.0081,0.3494,1.9307,1.1334,4.2734,1.0274,1.6923,3.7981,1.6072,5.1607,3.6065,4.6029,0.2063,2.4788,0.4163,0.4664,0.5216,0.0002,1.8975,4.7447,5.5938,0.2791,1.7178,1.3354,1.8854,5.2594,1.6034,1.9838,1.0949,1.341,2.7956,0.9159,4.2859,5.6443,0.0087,2.0839,2.3153,0.2678,0.4838,6.279,3.8501,1.6641,5.9653,0.9896,2.4504,1.3287,3.1313,2.8559,0.2699,1.6868,0.7679,1.1068,4.9575,3.2508,3.0068,6.0604,1.1732,3.8705,2.539,4.5134,0.758,0.356,0.0002,3.5084,0.1179,0.556,4.3456,0.6723,1.9284,5.0253,4.71,6.0119,4.1887,5.383,1.624,0.2105,1.3876,1.0639,5.5986,1.04,3.1652,4.2461,0.5535,1.2715,0.2096,1.3456,4.3595,0.7082,0.0864,0.3273,0.4911,3.1351,1.0403,5.1387,3.8144,0.5223,0.9438,4.3976,1.5672,1.6768,3.3055,1.1922,5.7253,1.9792,2.2872,4.9792,0.4888,3.8552,2.5574,0.2267,2.4801,2.3633,1.0053,0.2068,0.1619,0.0002,5.4362,4.6435,0.8091,4.0081,6.1389,0.7265,0.0001,6.1961,6.7801,2.9469,2.6235,1.8174,3.4673,2.4781,3.0808,0.6287,1.2643,0.8721,4.9574,2.1148,6.2891,2.2461,0.3839,1.2642,5.2183,1.9059,1.7277,4.1052,4.1975,2.1329,2.0991,1.8143,2.1969,2.0138,0.0095,0.0377,3.84]}
{"id":247,"ended":true,"length":543,"gen_text":"You are a commercial airliner pilot. The moment before you turn your phone off to begin the flight your SO sends you a deeply concerning text. \"Beware of that annoying voice coming from your home on the other end of the line because it will say 'B' on top of everything else on the screen. It's probably time to change your carrier switch but once you have that done, make sure you are safe and back off and make sure the battery is not used in any way.\"\n\nWhen this occurs you will have to give up your seat and turn your phone off. As we said earlier you will need to set up an event that will be run on your behalf but for now we are just showing you with a simple idea.\n\nFor any one reading this post they know what a flight planning application can be.\n\nWith your mobile phone out you use it to schedule flights. There are many different types of flight and some are more challenging. As part of our research we have created an online flight planning application based on mobile phone users.\n\nWe have created a website that allows you to control your flight and when you want. You can then send out a text from your mobile phone to your SO when you are at work.\n\nIf the text is not sent by email, this is also something that can be done. For example:\n\nIf you had been on a scheduled flight the minute before and your app is crashing every 6 minutes you could send a text to your SO.\n\nIf the user doesn't understand your email that can even help you get to your SO at least a little more quickly.\n\nOnce you have saved your device then you can add a date and location on your SO in seconds and this is how we setup plans. One way we found to have very long conversations was by simply typing something that would trigger the text response.\n\nThe other methods we used were to create an event called scheduled flights over a short period of time. This is what we call events with short duration events.

{"id":2548,"ended":true,"length":528,"gen_text":"The Earth is actually a huge Civilization\/Sims video game and the owner of it just found a list of chest codes for it. So where is the list? \u00a0Well, it's only the one you need to find in the menu. \u00a0So let me give you the answer for you to find the list of key codes for the game using your own experience.\nYou'll be able to place all of these and other code in a sub-folder, and each of these will allow us to locate the corresponding key code for the game in your head, or have we found one with the game name set up. \u00a0I could have said something much more succinct, like this:\nI'll be able to find all of the codes or code you found on the Game Center, and I can place any one of them, even if some of the others are simply ignored. There are really no limits to what you can do with these codes. \u00a0 However there are so many other ways to use these codes that I just can't think of any way to use them all, or even any of them at all. \u00a0I know for some reason that there are so many of you out there that don't use code names, but I guess the answer to one of those questions is: I know for some reason that there are so many people out there that don't use code names, but I guess the answer to one of those questions is: Why the heck should I use this code? \u00a0I've always loved this game.\u00a0 The way it works, it feels great. \u00a0There's just something unique about using code names, because you have no way to distinguish between the right and left codes so, when somebody gets a clue, they know where they're supposed to go in the game. \u00a0They don't have to go through the menu. \u00a0The right codes won't lead them down an uninteresting path.\u00a0 I can almost hear each time something weird happens. \u00a0You can actually hear it, even though you can't really tell. \u00a0In any case, these Codes have been set up to let us find the codes we don't need at the time. \u00a0You won't run any problems, you'll know what codes are required at the end of the game. \u00a0All code written by us is included in Steam Workshop, where the community can get it downloaded. \u00a0Please let me know if you have any problems or requests for additional keys. \u00a0Thanks. I hope this helps anyone that runs into any kind of problems with this system. \u00a0You can always contact me directly, and I'll try my best to fix it. \u00a0You'll still be able to enjoy all of these awesome features when the game is installed on your system.","token_len":571,"entropy":[8.7224,1.342,5.6251,2.0192,4.6372,14.0838,6.7005,6.3035,5.6235,7.2774,0.0342,3.4515,2.7016,10.1843,0.4598,2.7768,5.5198,5.785,2.5046,6.3586,0.1271,13.776,7.1638,2.0994,2.9322,1.2438,3.301,6.1952,1.9856,1.1642,3.2068,1.8336,6.3565,0.1279,3.2919,0.7607,1.8892,0.7137,4.5941,3.029,3.3707,3.1616,2.6923,0.5617,2.1294,3.3982,0.8368,5.6973,1.3887,0.9593,0.0006,3.1918,3.8128,2.6699,2.9274,0.0917,2.3564,5.471,3.8717,0.4065,5.0418,1.2555,1.1364,1.5719,1.915,5.8286,0.386,1.5913,1.2358,1.1141,5.9424,3.8097,2.4161,4.7852,0.9005,2.6664,4.0637,2.4335,3.4477,0.7398,0.006,5.6016,3.0012,1.1881,1.2539,5.5084,2.6812,4.0603,1.9858,2.2753,5.7442,1.5392,2.1539,3.0607,2.3366,5.1473,1.7689,1.4015,0.751,4.6048,6.8627,0.0518,4.3652,1.0021,4.2414,2.2211,1.6475,1.5468,0.8721,0.4037,2.7517,2.6993,5.8145,3.1023,2.3692,5.754,5.9361,2.8431,2.5691,5.0307,1.3034,2.8045,3.5805,5.0127,3.0668,1.4901,0.9168,0.0019,3.271,5.0783,2.2624,4.6871,3.3496,4.339,0.6699,6.0194,1.076,2.9741,1.8686,0.6006,0.5083,3.7634,3.1989,2.5968,2.3264,0.0364,1.7496,1.938,0.5881,1.121,1.4817,5.9618,4.8337,3.8802,3.4455,3.0583,0.7921,4.9531,3.3248,2.0172,1.2998,1.8976,2.2448,4.248,3.5953,3.1858,0.3145,0.5998,3.4682,3.3145,1.1239,5.466,0.5547,1.9255,2.4337,1.002,5.7439,3.7759,0.6429,5.6534,1.1015,5.4991,2.209,2.2535,0.8174,0.945,1.4118,0.0639,0.5825,0.8055,1.4412,0.6858,0.8839,4.4284,4.8646,5.1523,0.5785,5.1215,0.0343,2.8999,1.5533,0.7715,2.9111,1.2175,0.2156,0.9427,1.09,3.653,1.7828,0.0125,1.787,0.0267,1.752,3.1042,0.6237,3.1118,0.3777,1.2571,3.0026,2.8562,1.5792,3.143,1.1166,0.3437,1.2032,0.012,0.3331,1.2367,0.0021,1.6756,3.4592,4.0253,2.7947,1.4699,1.0778,2.6504,0.6288,3.4564,0.0317,3.1048,3.149,1.0895,0.0048,1.4694,3.1242,0.0004,3.9529,4.5256,3.2608,1.6845,1.7326,1.3309,4.3345,3.3215,2.9097,1.826,6.4952,0.6972,1.37,1.2196,0.4702,3.0858,3.5071,3.5715,2.5536,0.1025,0.0018,0.3209,0.3445,0.0787,0.4142,0.0119,2.2152,0.4099,0.0023,0.181,0.2085,0.0006,0.1917,0.2993,0.0073,0.1895,0.0392,0.0434,0.0224,0.0418,0.0031,0.0019,0.1156,0.0004,0.0059,0.0025,0.0016,0.0325,5.9893,4.59,1.8193,3.6402,0.5434,1.1507,2.5435,0.9071,0.8819,0.981,0.0017,1.7138,2.7865,3.3565,3.6085,2.7965,0.4805,1.9646,4.4496,3.6429,3.9224,0.9571,2.2699,2.0511,1.5345,3.6993,2.9431,1.593,0.9591,0.0052,3.5534,1.1984,3.2797,2.1278,6.1377,0.1319,4.3726,2.2315,0.049,1.8557,3.8353,1.7559,2.8743,2.7721,3.639,0.8225,5.1578,2.0192,1.7392,5.3254,0.8765,2.0902,3.1727,5.4132,5.098,2.8203,6.8221,4.7911,1.8791,5.125,1.0533,0.8505,2.6196,2.5608,1.8053,0.9456,3.5533,0.0007,0.894,4.1236,0.9933,0.4854,0.4412,0.8531,0.0085,3.2035,2.4006,0.0005,1.2034,0.1593,2.8754,1.8934,1.2204,4.4047,2.4514,0.3119,0.0092,2.9763,5.421,1.6449,5.6301,0.003,5.3866,2.3461,3.7724,4.2378,4.2417,1.4976,0.5867,0.8212,3.1921,2.8841,2.7804,5.8435,2.2602,5.3565,3.8593,4.221,3.5764,0.2549,1.6963,1.0229,0.004,3.6119,1.4974,4.3418,3.0115,2.1075,2.4125,3.3224,2.4063,1.2335,2.033,0.1657,3.035,2.4749,1.926,0.7708,0.0064,4.4119,3.5504,0.3382,0.1745,4.0625,6.3676,3.5056,1.535,4.8644,0.2689,1.4196,3.3405,2.2522,2.3333,1.495,1.7532,2.4615,4.8509,0.0005,1.264,4.3723,2.0891,2.0267,1.2845,0.9284,0.0067,3.1003,3.8115,0.001,5.9764,4.8808,3.2401,2.3057,2.1702,1.3803,4.3005,1.6888,2.7657,1.8934,3.6557,2.9596,0.4944,3.6794,0.3473,0.3336,0.3753,1.0338,0.7455,0.0092,3.8613,5.2575,6.1871,1.6859,2.8633,1.4231,4.1811,0.6717,8.1427,1.906,1.4028,4.6196,3.5537,3.1047,1.3628,3.4908,2.458,5.7481,1.3051,0.7686,0.0117,5.2422,4.1567,0.2769,0.0135,0.3438,0.3925,1.1586,0.1978,2.2571,2.1178,4.0286,1.4587,4.1128,5.0846,1.0309,1.1731,0.0039,2.5631,1.6965,3.5152,2.0142,1.4348,1.1233,3.9931,2.6091,6.4213,0.4331,1.1111,2.6145,0.0013,2.0639,1.3504,1.3291,3.017,0.5295,1.3646,0.0059,3.396,0.7028,3.0697,2.1981,0.1425,3.0625,1.9637,2.4257,0.393,0.8285,1.8808,1.3425,0.034,0.0285,2.849,1.9134,0.9004,1.4797,0.0094,3.1905,2.8173,3.6853,1.3562,0.2409,0.0019,5.793,4.5018,0.5509,1.8298,4.5204,2.691,4.5987,2.595,1.2642,0.72,5.9997,2.2434,0.3778,1.3433,0.6319]}
{"id":1333,"ended":false,"length":552,"gen_text":"Write the shortest story possible. The twist? Include the 3 topics of sex, religion and mystery.\n\n. The twist? Include the 3 topics of sex, religion and mystery. Create a single point with all the characters' answers. If you want to keep the complexity in the ending, add a third question into the ending with those answers. This is simple, but important. If you don't want to see all three points, remove each question, and add them to the beginning of the story.\n\n, remove each question, and add them to the beginning of the story. Include every character in their story with their story. Some characters aren't as believable, with a twist. This will break the stories or your game.\n\nExample\n\nCatherine can be a smart, cool woman living in London with little money and a heart. She says hello to some people who help her build what will be her future, and there's a problem. A few months later, she gets some money and a heartbreak. Catherine asks what she can do for this change in her. A woman enters her room in a hurry, and Catherine says, \"I know what your heart is doing, but I can't do this to give you money to buy this heart.\"\n\nShe asks, \"Is there anything I could do for you?\" Then, \"Yes, go ahead and give me more money!\" And she answers the same question over and over again.\n\nIn the game, this means she can talk to people, read books like Shakespeare will, and tell her secrets about their lives.\n\nBut Catherine doesn't have a happy ending. She loses her job, and her job isn't worth $40,000. One girl, a nurse at the hospital, saves money by selling a heart to her employer, where she's turned into a whore. The nurse then offers her money because she wants to be a nurse, so she helps the nurse's friend. But when Catherine tells the nurse's friend about her heart, she asks, \"What are you asking, what do you want from me? Don't you think I would love that?\"\n\nIt doesn't matter what you ask about the heart you're giving it to. The ending will be just what is needed. There will be no ambiguity for you and you will just go on the world's worst journey ever.\n\n. The ending won't take away from the game. You will always be there.

{"id":4922,"ended":false,"length":561,"gen_text":"You wake up as per normal this morning. You find out that it's 2016 and you try to piece together 2015 using pictures from your phone or Facebook. You are attacked by a giant robot. The robot says, \"You're not allowed to use your phone with this robot for any period of time...'\" You are forced to play a hard time and eventually you have to quit.\nYou become depressed. You feel like you just had a bad night.\nYou decide to have sex with this robot. It shows no signs of responding, but you're completely out of your mind. The robot gives you two options:\nYou can either wait until you have a better option but you can also have vaginal intercourse with it. This is pretty awesome. If you do this you will feel much better about yourself.\nYou decide to have sex with it. You have this amazing experience and are very impressed by your sex performance. You can feel the robot give up after it, so there is no need to have sex with it again. The robot says that you are not allowed to use your phone, but you get this advice from your friend who will say, \"You're just a lucky person!\" If you decide to do that ( you can still do this ) you will feel better about yourself. When your girlfriend gets home she will see you with the robot and then will send you a picture. Then she will make the picture and you will end up having sex with it.\nYou have a bad day. When you wake up the robot lets you use your phone that day. What happened? You went out at least 5 minutes late. It has very high risk if you don't have a phone. You end up having sex with it in a few minutes. The robot starts giving information about a robot. You have very long conversations about your girlfriend, how to keep her happy, where to go.

{"id":4622,"ended":true,"length":520,"gen_text":"New Day, 2012.\n\nIn the year since those first videos began popping up on YouTube, YouTube has become one of the fastest growing video hosting companies in the world, and that's really what it's all about. As with every other video hosting company out there, there's a pretty great deal of competition between hosting service providers and startups\u2014at least in this part of the world. However, it's interesting to ponder the current state of the Internet. The Internet is so saturated that people who can afford the services and have a very broad base of support aren't likely to find ways to pay the bills\u2014it's very much a commodity.\n\nAs a result, YouTube can be a pretty difficult company to build from the ground up, especially in its recent history, when the largest video hosting and video distribution sites have faced competition, and there's so much at stake now.\n\nWhat Can This Change?\n\nThis year, YouTube has found itself in a tough market position as it continues to grow. As of now, the company is one of only three publicly traded video services (YouTube.com, YouTube.ca, YouTube_UK.com and YouTube.co.uk) in the U.S. That's a huge leap to put on a new record, as this new business has huge potential for further growth.\n\nAs such, we'll be focusing on more video as they become more important items that customers look to for when choosing a service. By and large, you're going to see large scale content distribution, and as a result, YouTube is going to be a bit of a hot market for video hosting at the beginning of the year.\n\nEven though the market has been upended by the arrival of YouTube's Instant Video service in June 2011, the company remains an interesting source of revenue over the last two years.\n\nWhile this new form of content distribution is good for revenue, it will certainly leave a lot of people in financial trouble over the coming years\u2014if not for YouTube's own recent moves away from offering paid subscriptions and the like. This isn't to say that any of this will help YouTube win back interest in its original content. But as more content is posted to YouTube, new content producers can be built and new content creators can move to pay their bills.\n\nIn the end, this brings YouTube into a new world with new, higher-quality content. In a year where this kind of big revenue opportunity is so prevalent, YouTube may start to see that demand for video content increase.\n\nYou May Also Like: 7 Quick Facts About Video Streaming\n\nFeatured Image credit: Flickr\/Hassan Ehr\n\nLike What You're Reading?

If you have any questions about this latest clone club idea and how it's affecting you, feel free to add your thoughts in the comments. We have been researching this idea with the use of people who were raised by clones and have come up with various ways to get rid of the clones with ease. A few of us found our way to a cloning center. As a group more and more people are moving away from the clone clubs, with little or no information on how to change them to suit your lifestyle and new circumstances.\n\n.

Our people now have access to the cloning center, where they can watch the lives of clones and provide tips and help on how to do the same. It makes perfect sense because people could be the ones that find the cloning center easier and cheaper, while maintaining access to a better community and providing more of their clones with a happy life. The old clones have also been getting better and better on our forums and in other places I've been able to find better people to support the project. I've written about this as recently as my last visit to the clone club.\n\nIf you read the comments on this article please read the following links:\n\n\nAbout the Author Mike Lee is the Founder of The Evolution of Family Life website, an internet community oriented community of people sharing ideas, experiences and information about cloning.

We have been researching this idea with the use of people who were raised by clones and have come up with various ways to get rid of the clones with ease. A few of us found our way to a cloning center. As a group more and more people are moving away from the clone clubs, with little or no information on how to change them to suit your lifestyle and new circumstances.\n\n.

Our people now have access to the cloning center, where they can watch the lives of clones and provide tips and help on how to do the same. It makes perfect sense because people could be the ones that find the cloning center easier and cheaper, while maintaining access to a better community and providing more of their clones with a happy life. The old clones have also been getting better and better on our forums and in other places I've been able to find better people to support the project. I've written about this as recently as my last visit to the clone club.\n\nIf you read the comments on this article please read the following links:\n\n\nAbout the Author Mike Lee is the Founder of The Evolution of Family Life website, an internet community oriented community of people sharing ideas, experiences and information about cloning.

{"id":2028,"ended":true,"length":532,"gen_text":"You are the first person to ever be successfully revived from cryogenic sustainment, and you have just woken up... your father died in that dream,\" said Shoshana, who was born to a Japanese woman in 2001 and is now from Kanto. \"I want you to be able to talk to me a lot about what's going on with those people.\"\n\nHe said that his parents raised him and his mother during a time when the Japanese were on high alert for war. \"We used to give them candy and stuff like that,\" he said. His father was always so excited about school, he said. \"He would come up on TV and speak about baseball, but our mother was such a basketball nerd that she would do all those things. So she was the first person to ever be able to talk about her love of baseball.\"\n\nShoshana said that during the time, he and his siblings were working late on school, and that he was often out of work, but that he made some money helping other students stay with other students. \"It was a great time for us. We were so lucky to have a lot of resources that we could invest in,\" he said.\n\nShoshana said he attended the annual International Students Association's \"Free Lunch\" program (ISNA) and became a fellow when he was 13. At ISNA, Shoshana was a member of the board of trustees and paid the same dues as his parents. When he was at university as a teenager, SHOOT said, he was often able to get into local and foreign language classes.\n\nAt 17, he moved himself and his family to a community center in Los Angeles and, as a teen, worked with an older cousin in a music program. Shoshana lived in a small apartment near a grocery store and eventually moved in with another student who worked at a local restaurant.\n\nShoshana says he was the lucky one who was able to get his dream of graduating college back. And he is thrilled that his father could bring it back.\n\n\"It's not that Shoshana's dream has never happened,\" said Shoshana. \"It's that I am trying again.\"\n\nShoshana is working on a film based on his father's story about how his family became addicted to alcohol and drugs. The film, \"We Are Friends Forever,\" centers on three young Japanese Americans -- Shoshana's father, a barber with Japanese, and his mother, an accountant who uses Japanese-style techniques to help her business survive.\n\nShoshana is on set filming the film this Saturday, starting at 8 p.m., and he'll post it on his website. He's also making his documentary, \"We Are Friends Forever,\" in theaters on Aug. 17.","token_len":575,"entropy":[3.8828,3.2036,3.2706,1.7928,0.6907,3.7694,3.0354,6.5699,6.3637,2.2148,7.3841,0.902,10.469,0.0565,2.4715,1.2743,1.2777,1.7409,4.5895,7.6388,0.0166,0.1662,6.3599,5.1638,5.1746,3.87,2.3572,4.0041,4.1005,3.4449,2.5169,5.8608,4.4295,0.817,2.0234,1.3341,1.9945,1.7968,3.3648,1.3771,3.4643,2.3802,2.6994,5.252,1.6962,3.0724,0.9283,4.2926,5.6053,1.1518,0.4682,1.0252,1.5755,3.6468,3.008,0.1321,1.8677,1.8153,0.0052,4.1689,0.7253,1.0991,4.9304,1.8096,1.4375,2.3626,2.7368,0.6027,0.0353,2.0407,5.3783,1.7476,1.7709,0.3624,0.0004,4.2394,1.9423,1.9653,2.6712,3.0668,5.2706,0.2109,3.3584,0.5951,2.5954,4.8745,1.3663,0.9935,0.352,2.2339,1.4673,1.7363,4.6791,4.8287,0.1888,2.22,3.9125,0.9709,1.8835,2.5183,3.8305,0.0275,5.5209,2.0807,3.955,1.4473,3.5986,1.9064,0.0175,1.2406,0.6041,0.2383,0.168,5.2953,1.0586,1.7446,5.4304,4.7967,4.1868,1.1434,5.3564,1.3281,1.4192,0.3644,0.926,0.9663,1.4388,1.9129,2.8586,2.5171,4.8459,5.5767,0.4752,6.1957,2.0559,5.3873,1.2189,3.9613,5.5529,3.4245,1.7434,4.7887,0.1395,6.1325,4.3975,1.8726,0.644,1.4957,4.2868,2.5998,3.0759,0.5837,1.9462,2.5978,2.2018,1.5957,3.2479,2.7781,0.642,0.8193,1.6653,1.0804,1.4009,0.0024,1.1064,1.6844,3.3481,4.8974,0.819,1.3294,0.8663,0.1361,0.0002,1.9417,0.0125,0.0017,1.1826,1.0351,3.766,1.4339,2.8945,4.6086,1.0192,1.9184,0.1307,3.9071,1.5981,4.4124,5.8914,3.7909,3.8136,3.9645,1.521,2.2054,1.6728,2.2653,3.6346,3.8638,1.1504,1.8644,2.4722,2.0584,1.5011,0.8733,5.3014,3.9733,2.58,4.9153,2.8543,1.7747,5.1629,3.9717,4.1338,0.5581,0.6549,1.352,2.7904,0.5401,2.021,2.7638,1.2857,1.553,1.1634,2.6637,1.2166,1.3998,3.5164,2.4477,1.0232,0.8747,1.8366,2.7522,0.0272,5.7229,2.8883,0.9548,0.9682,5.6482,0.3325,1.4802,0.3951,0.059,0.0652,0.651,0.0002,1.8564,0.011,0.0017,0.8163,1.8124,5.6589,2.1731,4.4412,4.3306,4.9924,2.5187,3.1586,3.3666,5.6987,3.6581,0.6192,2.1296,5.4744,5.859,4.133,0.7462,2.4832,5.0322,1.3362,6.079,4.6145,0.3116,0.4063,3.2687,0.5651,4.8882,0.6224,0.0007,0.1332,1.5703,0.0047,0.0012,2.5984,2.8181,2.0259,0.1267,0.5163,3.7719,0.497,2.0556,1.4113,5.8561,2.7014,4.3338,2.4254,0.4496,1.764,1.8973,0.5011,4.6773,0.9237,0.9858,4.6782,2.9407,6.045,0.2402,3.6414,0.0714,5.1948,0.8626,4.8328,4.5036,0.3411,0.5038,1.7146,5.0402,5.0074,0.0017,2.5717,3.2696,6.0152,4.9239,2.479,4.162,0.3655,1.3946,0.8502,0.0002,4.7218,4.9465,0.1237,1.2913,3.1237,8.1099,3.5626,0.1541,1.5373,0.316,1.997,4.663,1.8257,0.7094,4.9255,0.0343,2.6931,4.3449,2.7842,1.0477,3.4093,0.0783,3.2315,2.6848,3.106,3.9115,4.6911,2.1347,1.4087,5.1488,2.7824,0.4985,2.5504,0.03,0.0017,6.1442,1.3221,1.2057,2.2779,1.2865,3.9164,2.1534,4.6354,0.023,1.7776,4.8953,1.3342,1.4914,0.0481,4.4935,4.0455,2.6612,2.34,1.5101,1.025,2.0893,2.9755,0.3048,1.2423,0.0002,1.1316,0.0211,0.002,3.6917,1.0778,2.1984,4.3732,5.4174,0.6278,1.4645,2.3928,0.3524,0.0024,1.792,1.9838,3.8569,1.0021,6.0403,2.7333,2.3951,1.5793,5.6018,1.1926,2.3964,3.7761,1.3139,1.6452,3.0656,4.8347,4.5125,1.5736,0.6514,0.8406,0.6012,0.0002,0.2125,2.3995,0.7914,3.623,2.8291,6.2753,0.0201,0.0061,2.7335,1.7518,2.7126,2.4489,1.7223,1.0967,1.1175,1.5455,0.0258,0.0024,0.5604,0.0294,0.7877,0.5507,0.949,2.8071,3.9173,4.7832,5.5938,1.7464,0.9084,0.0003,2.2283,0.0413,0.002,2.3918,4.2599,0.8439,1.2352,3.4108,3.2479,0.0326,0.5119,2.7041,0.0584,0.8853,2.512,1.623,1.3158,2.9236,3.2364,5.1525,0.0226,1.8049,1.1867,0.9337,0.5497,1.8065,0.5,1.5842,2.1048,5.2171,2.0233,4.3077,2.9428,0.2829,3.4729,0.1609,4.9986,2.4301,2.2007,3.414,5.2744,1.2171,0.043,0.0049,0.9497,0.9538,0.2027,1.5879,4.8655,0.9759,4.6571,4.8641,5.6565,1.8799,0.2752,0.5182,0.2119,2.4365,2.898,1.7864,4.7446,1.4726,2.9944,2.4898,4.7026,0.3677,2.1994,1.0995,3.6115,3.2014,0.3851,0.6061,0.0002,1.2056,0.0284,0.0021,2.5011,5.2754,3.1696,2.2545,1.0791,0.3517,2.6846,4.843,1.2745,5.4577,0.3575,2.1659,0.3052,0.0004,0.0002,2.023,1.3651,2.1962,4.2597,3.0762,1.5781,0.611,1.0306,1.86,1.2846,2.5865,2.4121,0.8395,3.4883,2.827,3.0924,2.3326,0.3566,2.6212,0.2538,0.1273,0.0161,0.4404,2.876,2.5166,1.9154,3.1083,0.0034,3.27,0.5867]}

I couldn't do it without you!\"\n\nThen the man turned to his audience and said, \"I have a great idea for you to follow, and that's why I am starting a family.\"\n\nHe took those words from his lips and said, \"I'm sure you have the answer.\n\nIt is a very good idea for us to begin a family. And my family is so close to this place that I just can't bear the thought of not doing it right away. I have a very hard time talking about it because I hate our children, and the fact of the matter is that this family has gone through what most people know is a very good storm. But it is what it is.\n\nIt's a great idea to start some sort of a new family, which will include everyone, and there's a very big feeling of self responsibility that comes with doing that.\n\nI love my children. I love my husband. I love my children, too. I love my daughters. I like my children. But I know that when they die or they die young, they've got to give back. When they die, it will all rest in peace.\n\nThe other thing I did with my children was just make the best of a lot of difficulties we were in life today. I had a house in New York City. I had a great apartment. That's a lot of problems, and one of them is that we're living in a city very much in need of help, and I can't afford it right now.\n\nWe live in this part of America that is the worst. It has been in very dire ways in the last six years that my children and my wife have been in that city.\n\nWe were so fortunate, because we have a lot of kids who are going to be in kindergarten, and then when you are going through tough years, you know, people can't sit down and help you, because not even the ones at my home have the money to pay for their schooling.\n\nI did things I never dreamed about even as you're not going to see my kids. The fact that I had one of the first homes in New York City, that has a decent hospital now where I have a home to go to, has kind of transformed my life. I live in New York.

He's so fascinated.\n\nThe first time that he tries really hard to read, however, he just gets so engrossed with a book he doesn't even understand just how to draw (except maybe that song...).\n\nVideo Games\n\nWestern Animation","token_len":577,"entropy":[7.3022,3.3171,12.2354,1.2531,1.8943,2.2521,0.036,4.4005,3.8212,1.7011,2.8165,9.5697,0.6351,0.9205,3.474,0.0127,6.9422,1.0627,0.0171,3.4399,3.6652,3.2541,3.1722,0.0189,0.3022,1.8234,0.0319,3.289,0.7293,5.5055,2.1928,2.7629,0.7291,0.0493,1.6822,0.0596,1.2177,0.0994,0.0983,0.0039,0.0031,0.1515,0.0011,0.0157,0.0008,0.0041,0.0096,0.0025,0.004,0.0119,0.0011,0.0498,1.6981,0.5069,1.7011,1.0996,0.4594,0.0893,0.0185,3.4068,4.2368,1.443,4.6116,1.1253,0.2095,0.848,0.0237,0.21,4.4586,0.0049,3.4117,0.0639,1.1495,1.4949,0.3198,0.0001,0.1727,3.6718,1.4984,0.5738,0.2917,0.0584,0.0162,1.3376,3.2765,3.9516,6.2523,2.8177,0.8206,0.2892,0.0002,0.3646,0.2228,1.3093,0.4081,0.2277,0.0468,0.0155,5.294,1.279,1.1067,1.5383,0.0941,0.0002,0.2526,0.1981,0.647,0.1982,0.0959,0.0335,0.0025,4.5396,3.0737,2.9123,3.5795,0.678,0.0769,0.0002,0.1961,0.1181,1.2637,0.1807,0.0878,0.0308,0.0059,1.6423,3.2254,2.5522,3.0155,4.3078,1.9711,2.96,0.0346,4.0857,5.4005,3.6098,4.2426,2.3457,3.5971,0.7247,0.1081,0.0002,0.2721,0.1875,0.8254,0.1319,0.0867,0.0437,0.0133,2.3068,4.0251,1.4595,5.3716,1.0752,3.8667,4.432,0.1316,0.0002,10.2458,2.8395,0.6081,0.1694,0.5361,1.9529,2.2334,4.526,2.882,2.0725,2.6191,6.143,5.5363,1.5959,0.4441,0.4549,0.0002,4.6865,5.8058,3.8292,0.647,5.3601,5.9107,0.3357,4.9047,4.1273,0.1006,3.6729,4.3054,2.4332,5.6473,2.6893,0.0024,2.6485,4.4288,2.6647,3.5995,0.6643,1.01,4.2835,0.7618,0.5473,1.5315,5.9737,2.1499,1.6984,2.627,2.33,0.9071,5.2476,0.9576,0.7931,1.6387,2.2969,1.6272,4.0589,0.001,2.8183,2.3624,2.2472,1.3679,2.9549,3.3472,2.4232,0.2879,3.8028,4.3773,3.1348,5.4476,0.1225,0.4016,0.7378,5.0913,5.9874,1.4962,0.0021,1.8116,5.1025,2.7356,0.3471,4.5009,1.0564,1.2443,2.0689,1.2116,3.1159,6.0284,2.5695,4.3026,4.2451,1.3678,2.5652,0.0269,3.6685,5.9405,6.8637,1.8733,4.5946,2.8272,2.2266,2.7056,1.4819,0.8171,1.6655,5.1756,2.4227,5.1944,4.3693,0.0137,3.8902,2.2647,0.3446,2.5663,3.2055,2.5312,2.585,2.3639,5.7136,5.1951,1.506,2.4025,0.9541,0.0003,2.0208,0.4723,0.0786,0.0002,0.0069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0047,0.0004,0.2884,0.0037,0.9583,0.0015,0.0047,0.0003,0.3672,0.0757,0.003,0.0028,0.0004,0.8037,0.0934,0.003,0.0003,0.6336,0.0,0.004,0.3889,0.0278,0.0002,1.4985,0.0002,0.0043,0.0003,0.1797,0.4772,0.0021,0.0027,0.0279,0.0002,0.3972,0.04,0.0003,2.798,1.3308,2.4258,0.6603,4.4925,4.9147,5.7756,4.0301,1.9843,2.255,4.2293,5.8774,2.8695,6.4417,5.3214,2.9976,2.7261,3.1177,3.4255,4.8234,1.5671,2.8397,3.9066,2.6869,0.9716,0.6766,5.8806,3.0364,0.0377,3.0549,3.0159,2.4289,1.1525,3.0935,0.5358,1.5709,5.5353,5.0382,3.712,3.9272,3.1549,0.624,2.2805,0.9715,2.565,1.925,0.0018,0.154,0.0015,1.9885,4.1485,0.8052,4.4433,1.6634,0.0756,1.1969,3.2179,0.0012,3.1962,3.0038,4.0958,0.5918,5.6248,3.2469,4.7006,4.9131,5.3248,1.2012,5.9734,4.0233,0.8364,2.8608,1.6793,3.0142,0.3633,4.2859,2.7269,2.0138,1.1537,2.9016,5.0089,4.3041,2.6633,1.1261,1.8419,0.0004,5.3971,3.8584,3.1198,4.7698,1.5937,3.9804,0.636,0.0004,4.019,0.0828,0.0002,3.5899,0.0006,0.0083,0.0279,0.0002,4.7586,0.7302,0.3429,5.4776,3.7592,0.9125,2.8154,0.1843,0.0003,0.9689,6.4924,3.0603,0.5165,2.3147,0.5633,1.6271,2.4261,4.2585,2.5687,0.0396,3.2191,1.4401,2.8703,0.9662,5.6726,4.3523,4.4723,6.6834,3.8648,1.7022,1.2696,3.1389,5.6803,5.392,4.2464,1.8943,2.467,5.6902,1.4578,1.1498,4.9585,2.7442,4.2898,0.9975,2.4161,3.8809,2.543,0.0415,2.2637,2.6368,0.6519,5.4349,1.7243,1.6049,2.9125,3.4249,1.2086,2.0883,2.2314,3.2377,5.261,4.4651,5.3996,2.5962,2.6036,5.6733,0.9568,1.7738,0.8587,5.3338,1.6018,0.7993,1.9961,0.0003,2.0218,3.9737,1.3085,1.6632,3.0508,1.8386,2.723,2.45,0.3599,0.6802,4.4924,1.6067,4.9057,2.4574,3.7019,5.8429,5.6114,2.2468,0.3515,0.8098,1.8474,2.4042,3.3365,5.17,6.225,1.4,0.0003,2.0681,3.5212,0.2923,4.1328,1.3065,1.1091,6.8144,0.1906,0.5702,3.3813,2.7847,5.0675,0.1396,0.9404,3.1894,3.6921,2.1329,4.2469,0.0005,0.0029,2.2234,3.4985,0.909,1.7742,1.8531,0.0005,0.8135,3.4654,6.4755,0.7891,0.8341,4.8364,5.4141,4.4911,2.6252,4.0861,4.502,5.4458,1.8779,0.9189,0.0004,2.3906,0.0025,0.0069,0.0003,3.7036,0.004]}
{"id":2403,"ended":false,"length":552,"gen_text":"You are a being that invents items that can bend the laws of nature. Describe your best inventions. Tell us about your current design for the game. Build on the information we provide to you. Discuss ideas with us. Read about the future. Tell us about new features that you have planned for your game. Tell us about your design goals.\n\nAbout our Creative Team\n\nShannon and Brian Johnson are team members and co-founders of CAAK Interactive, a digital company that works to empower creators to succeed. We have been featured in multiple articles from various publications, magazines and websites. Their work allows us to create products for developers, publishers, and game developers alike\u2014without resorting to an online or paperback format. We also provide the tools and tools that make the game our own.\n\nWe use all the tools and tools we use to create great games and help artists build great art. As part of our development philosophy, we focus on building amazing games based on proven technologies that are designed to support a wide variety of uses, not just game development. Our games can be played from every platform and are a direct evolution of the experience we strive to deliver. We have made improvements to the game in order to give the best possible experience: The first 100 levels can now change color to different colors, the last 60 can be turned off. You can go to your favorite app store to download the game's newest patch, and you can start playing it. The game is still in Beta, which means it will contain bugs and glitches for a long time, and that's when you start to learn how to play, and how to play a game properly. In our community, we are committed to giving everyone an experience that is a little better than their current game.\n\nOur goal is to keep our games fun to enjoy. All we want for this to happen is for programmers, developers, and fans to take the time out to play our games. To do that requires you to understand the game, understand what we're trying to do, and understand how we help you do that. To make this process easier, the designers of our games have created a series of game play quizzes that help you understand our game better. These quizzes can be helpful for you to ask your favorite questions or questions that aren't actually there yet.

Most of the Great Plains are found only on the Great Plains, but they are not present on the large scale of human activity.","token_len":579,"entropy":[11.9631,7.7822,8.1741,4.7006,12.4784,5.2444,0.5149,3.5089,5.2337,12.5475,2.5315,4.9958,7.609,4.8913,2.6598,6.198,7.0327,4.2489,1.148,4.8547,9.1599,4.7884,0.1064,1.6696,6.5643,3.7725,6.5923,0.887,5.1028,3.2486,2.1651,7.9767,1.4404,2.3381,0.0363,6.1079,3.2639,4.5583,0.0276,1.6556,1.3977,5.3669,6.4753,4.7067,3.2379,1.1857,1.491,1.8501,5.153,1.9925,0.0599,0.0831,3.2343,5.3188,3.3221,4.8036,4.9108,2.0306,1.1624,0.4675,2.333,5.3757,5.9311,5.9617,0.886,0.8782,2.4372,6.1419,3.3789,2.4055,4.9402,3.0789,2.8871,3.8265,2.9321,2.4555,0.2192,1.7853,4.6884,0.0125,0.0279,0.0919,1.507,4.5371,1.3844,2.3877,0.7699,2.3805,0.4687,0.2609,2.6073,4.2041,1.3181,3.3719,1.7948,2.1075,1.6934,2.6091,4.8135,1.5235,5.8936,0.0212,1.5231,1.2805,3.6655,2.2087,4.4805,0.0525,0.8205,4.4012,4.5666,0.8709,0.538,0.3079,1.7507,2.6066,0.7642,0.0101,0.0459,5.2471,1.0971,5.9603,0.8598,3.5144,0.5,2.1631,3.3502,0.8673,2.5654,0.3155,0.0622,0.2652,1.0194,1.2191,0.0003,0.6648,0.9873,5.2442,4.0543,0.0192,2.9529,2.8826,3.1463,3.3737,0.4716,3.5449,1.4941,1.5546,3.2358,4.1239,3.0715,0.9372,2.6039,1.3624,2.8343,4.534,0.5513,1.1477,0.0081,4.3969,3.7067,4.5233,0.7464,0.0942,6.9546,1.3105,1.4804,0.0002,0.2281,3.2885,2.4083,0.7757,0.3144,0.0975,0.0986,0.2219,0.7041,0.0048,0.0088,0.0005,0.0673,0.0073,0.0151,0.014,0.007,0.0034,0.0035,1.2983,4.3992,0.9875,0.0221,4.8103,4.9671,2.4704,4.6141,3.8876,1.4773,1.7162,3.5658,2.6798,2.7353,3.6576,4.0049,1.9002,3.3101,0.2599,3.5299,1.1214,2.6294,2.2313,1.7951,0.8837,0.0002,5.8116,5.4961,0.1441,0.988,4.8233,0.0475,3.5195,4.3785,0.0272,0.4139,0.4832,0.008,1.0289,3.5793,1.493,1.0333,4.1362,1.6742,0.1827,2.5447,1.3114,3.3307,2.382,0.7745,1.1959,4.6993,0.1213,0.0412,1.2852,2.1064,0.0032,5.5036,1.5464,4.4649,1.7559,2.4939,5.1786,1.1757,2.0733,5.4346,4.5824,2.186,2.3775,0.217,2.2355,1.1196,0.3402,0.7885,0.0353,2.6207,5.7263,1.4606,0.1638,1.2459,5.7586,0.7294,0.2234,5.6532,1.4303,5.5102,4.7903,0.003,2.971,0.2397,0.5674,0.0002,2.8364,3.5496,2.3701,0.6241,1.9853,2.2049,0.5683,0.4329,0.3774,0.0015,0.3982,1.9245,2.8844,5.5915,0.5289,3.3322,0.6081,0.6302,1.3245,0.0002,6.267,1.6078,3.7896,2.8715,0.0423,0.5129,1.2727,0.0034,5.4523,0.5792,0.8955,0.0036,1.0108,5.6017,1.2073,5.837,0.6854,0.0395,0.0036,1.7412,1.8574,11.346,4.9112,0.0002,3.3405,2.9985,0.0285,1.6414,2.3744,3.4565,0.5736,3.0887,4.6793,1.103,0.0157,5.2572,0.8894,2.5728,1.0985,7.0137,1.182,1.1704,2.2502,5.943,5.425,0.1998,3.819,0.0002,5.6606,4.5862,5.5318,3.5105,0.2092,0.0303,0.495,4.8309,2.2375,0.1901,1.1223,0.0021,0.5489,1.1432,0.9357,4.8202,0.0055,0.0004,1.8713,1.5447,4.3155,0.1352,0.311,5.2844,5.0691,1.1198,0.6105,3.2713,0.5339,2.0446,2.1378,2.4576,0.0331,0.163,0.0003,5.4694,2.2416,0.167,0.0018,0.0036,0.0124,0.0028,0.0014,0.0001,0.0047,0.001,0.0056,0.0021,10.2293,3.4406,3.1058,1.1827,2.2768,0.8423,3.6719,1.0267,0.6461,0.3452,0.8609,0.0008,6.7939,2.1232,2.0882,0.0074,0.8893,5.3726,2.7538,5.7681,0.1153,0.918,3.1462,1.6733,1.99,3.2994,1.5772,2.682,0.0241,0.7291,3.2288,5.487,0.9825,0.8163,0.0002,4.2482,0.0316,0.0453,0.0003,2.2918,0.018,0.0021,0.003,2.2883,5.2018,0.6372,0.0036,5.7995,0.6483,0.5405,4.7992,1.5003,0.1963,0.3675,0.0016,2.8,1.919,3.3856,0.0082,0.003,2.0788,0.942,6.177,3.4416,1.1326,0.2325,0.5916,0.0015,0.7081,0.3065,0.0002,3.8003,1.4076,5.4975,5.0031,1.4827,2.2396,0.2812,3.8004,1.3399,5.1535,3.6239,0.5572,0.8605,0.0048,2.1094,5.227,5.1444,3.9571,4.6826,1.5615,0.6822,0.6726,1.9379,1.2267,2.4551,0.016,0.8747,0.3259,0.0002,1.1772,3.1616,4.0015,4.6668,3.7699,0.0145,0.0101,0.2968,4.2618,4.1688,0.3238,2.6148,2.3484,4.9559,3.0632,1.7165,0.0967,0.1856,9.5787,2.0505,4.9449,5.7828,1.8229,1.4925,0.0285,0.4853,1.8494,5.2549,3.2001,0.0003,1.0859,0.2097,0.0002,0.5327,1.245,3.4742,0.5632,5.3577,4.5719,1.0647,1.5835,1.7246,0.228,0.4424,0.323,1.1631,1.3556,4.2795,0.701,3.78,2.4427,1.9902,1.769,2.4838,0.0263,0.0015,0.2454,5.8026,0.4681,0.3839,2.1024,0.0719,2.1536,4.1703,2.0184,1.0157,0.7253,1.3664,0.4332,1.589,1.6475,3.3902,0.7232,3.2381,2.4184,0.626,1.9955,5.2156,0.3528,0.2685,0.1981,1.9214,0.5192]}

{"id":4947,"ended":true,"length":522,"gen_text":"It's your first day as a travel writer for the 'Lonely Universe '. They need one paragraph on Earth, pronto.\n\n'It was only a year ago that I worked with the folks at B'nai B'rith' for a period of time and it's actually really nice to have time to talk with them and see how they have reacted.\n\n'I saw [them] after [their] holidays and see them go away, and they had this wonderful experience of being able to take these ideas and actually talk to these people, have them see it through with their brains, and then they're done. The guys on planet Earth were like 'oh, good.'.\n\n'They were very generous, very kind, generous people... a lot more than what you might think. They gave us something like $13,000 a week. And that really goes from what it would cost us to get them on Earth, to our ability to get them on Earth... [The men on the other side of the Earth] were incredible! And I know you went and sat down with them and spent some time just talking to them about what it meant to them when they got to Earth... they were very open and respectful. When you sit with somebody like that on the other side of the Earth, you do have to put their trust in them, and this man on the planet is really, really amazing.\n\n'And we're all really grateful that they are doing this. They're really trying. What a wonderful work.'\n\nIt is true that many of the men on Earth are from places far away and can only afford to take a few minutes to chat. But this is certainly different from other spaceships that can leave behind their 'lonely' counterparts.\n\nIn this case, where an international mission's mission typically lasts just six months, there is the possibility that these pilots could return during their time on the orbiting base, or even longer.\n\nThese young, brave souls have spent nearly half their lives fighting for their country, their planet... and their own survival.\n\nBut many of them will have been too busy chasing after'my friends', as you would expect. But if you can put a few extra dollars in your pocket and give them a real mission and hope that someday a new mission comes along, it will make a difference.\n\nIt is not just space travel that can save these young men, it is life in some of these 'good guys' from death.\n\nIf you are on a mission to explore this planet and send a crew of more than 50 aboard our Planet Earth, please visit the website http:\/\/www.planet-earth-us.com\/.\n\nThe full website can be purchased here at http:\/\/www.planet-earth-us.com\/.","token_len":579,"entropy":[3.0338,6.0687,3.5117,3.0897,3.7858,0.5866,8.6573,2.4524,3.7412,2.3651,7.0321,5.336,3.2687,1.8877,8.8818,11.2171,7.0005,5.5304,6.2761,6.8832,4.1653,7.9688,1.9505,13.0279,0.519,0.7025,1.3638,0.1579,5.1511,3.385,3.4199,4.6832,1.6758,3.6313,0.4295,0.8035,0.8053,5.451,2.2085,2.3141,5.6844,0.4969,5.9248,5.1036,1.8294,0.5433,0.0205,0.0055,0.001,4.7448,3.3361,1.5421,5.6186,0.2799,1.6742,2.5053,3.0772,2.034,5.7146,3.6392,3.0819,0.5811,1.8473,6.448,0.5659,2.339,2.0813,0.866,1.7114,1.9852,1.2803,0.2539,3.9542,3.926,1.872,1.8921,0.0004,0.2425,1.8341,5.1119,5.9,3.1565,0.1661,5.0717,5.0664,2.1983,0.7097,5.9047,0.9409,5.507,2.4807,4.9246,5.2058,2.4931,1.3996,1.7438,3.9106,3.5636,3.0823,2.9757,1.9424,1.5485,1.473,0.0105,4.1021,4.9968,4.3991,0.8466,5.488,4.3967,0.5265,3.0206,0.4374,2.4101,5.8586,0.9274,4.2421,4.118,1.8475,5.0079,2.0843,4.7902,1.6427,0.7492,1.901,2.6527,2.4704,5.3846,1.4299,4.4788,4.4221,4.0504,7.0291,1.3222,2.8379,2.9485,1.6889,2.6864,1.1531,4.7023,2.7825,8.1005,1.4054,0.0003,0.1212,1.7227,1.8962,2.8396,4.5333,1.6338,1.2965,2.4266,0.8221,5.3053,1.939,5.6781,5.6749,0.6303,3.8408,1.319,3.7063,1.8984,1.8861,1.1355,0.928,1.5509,3.7236,1.775,3.9343,4.4002,1.6461,5.4519,1.0551,0.1253,2.1258,2.0783,1.673,2.923,2.901,4.4316,5.6553,4.6556,3.6659,3.8923,2.2578,0.8644,1.8772,0.3593,2.721,1.8207,2.762,2.2047,2.0403,1.1301,4.1741,4.7026,0.0421,2.3707,0.2746,1.2601,1.6984,4.2112,4.6686,4.9102,4.7604,2.4542,1.884,3.2438,0.7075,2.031,0.1859,3.4505,0.4853,1.5028,5.6829,4.1293,2.8086,1.8986,4.3461,3.5337,5.3774,4.0708,4.9653,0.7382,0.8356,0.4505,0.8327,5.1975,2.3849,0.3246,5.5084,1.1742,0.4369,0.0751,2.5152,2.336,2.032,4.2102,0.4539,1.9061,5.2845,0.5816,3.0155,2.1015,1.1636,3.2214,3.3146,1.0876,2.0278,3.5818,1.3355,5.6619,1.1859,5.8456,1.4036,4.0235,4.0727,4.0025,1.031,0.3451,3.8622,1.9067,0.5412,0.0568,0.0963,0.1241,0.4802,0.5009,1.4778,5.0124,2.6133,0.5581,4.2049,3.8541,4.2713,0.1317,0.4012,1.6619,1.0465,4.9307,5.6405,3.4425,0.9542,3.6955,2.2827,3.3543,2.3452,0.0534,4.512,0.7708,0.4808,0.0002,0.1257,2.4937,3.7203,2.0972,2.3689,2.5768,1.6685,2.1769,1.1274,3.4789,2.5276,1.0435,1.1965,2.3677,1.1761,1.9419,5.5061,2.4265,5.8142,1.7926,1.9166,5.0975,2.6189,0.2659,0.0003,4.5295,2.083,3.8562,0.5147,3.2516,0.9856,0.5432,1.6926,0.5891,1.4262,1.6695,3.8838,4.556,2.9624,0.8272,2.4579,4.613,2.6085,4.2017,0.543,3.2559,1.5737,1.3488,2.5882,0.84,3.0654,1.7194,1.5876,3.5369,1.1768,5.463,4.0757,1.8003,3.7475,5.4327,0.0917,2.3901,3.1955,5.9078,3.1435,2.2126,5.3549,3.8942,0.5404,0.0548,0.9144,3.3142,0.7891,0.338,0.0004,3.4413,3.366,0.9892,0.3707,6.1358,5.0817,4.7434,4.1794,5.1496,2.1674,6.3391,3.9873,3.1028,3.9271,0.8029,0.429,3.1639,1.0589,3.9627,2.0556,0.6481,4.0628,5.9532,2.0039,3.5362,6.2588,1.7133,3.3032,0.9515,1.5874,5.2282,4.7075,2.2904,2.3652,1.5722,3.2636,0.691,0.1999,0.0004,4.5388,5.9725,3.5994,5.5237,1.8635,2.4031,3.6161,4.3647,3.6913,0.9608,0.3777,6.0802,1.1271,1.5058,1.969,1.3931,2.2415,1.7031,4.6189,1.1956,1.8839,2.8028,3.371,0.4107,0.5596,0.0003,3.5532,4.66,0.7538,1.1131,2.921,2.8765,3.5987,4.4508,2.1852,4.7418,1.3853,17.1958,4.2088,7.9183,9.5537,2.9595,5.5648,2.9125,0.31,0.8791,5.7911,3.6672,1.4426,4.1712,4.5413,2.474,2.3665,3.7924,3.4361,2.1356,2.3343,0.5102,1.4497,4.2263,0.473,0.9675,5.1916,4.102,3.4421,5.2359,1.9733,5.2707,4.2375,3.4489,2.4857,3.0606,0.1398,0.628,2.5517,1.4631,3.1483,1.5786,1.2044,0.3244,0.401,0.0003,3.4124,1.0796,3.0142,2.3799,4.0202,1.8361,0.6563,2.9417,3.609,3.9293,1.6544,1.0351,2.0675,1.048,1.0017,3.7472,2.7484,4.5704,2.4239,1.7571,4.844,5.7895,2.7866,0.7278,4.5503,4.1273,0.5468,0.3937,0.0003,4.4863,0.6488,1.6613,3.9245,1.4351,1.1879,1.1754,4.2474,4.4897,1.642,1.6913,5.7475,1.2763,3.4228,1.1048,5.0869,0.0434,3.167,4.4241,6.814,5.5916,1.1986,0.756,3.8932,4.0264,1.5618,3.113,4.7737,0.0009,0.6653,0.0009,1.7359,2.1064,0.8853,3.412,5.2862,0.2783,0.5424,3.742,0.8793,0.0002,2.76,5.4573,4.2087,1.2847,0.0381,6.0555,1.533,4.1861,1.1606,0.0007,0.2544,0.001,0.2196,0.1405,0.0112,0.05,0.0089,0.0201,0.0042,1.8939]}
{"id":74,"ended":false,"length":549,"gen_text":"the internet becomes conscious. what does it do? what would i want that in the future?\n\n\nIt might change the lives of others because of the internet. it might change the lives of those it's trying to help in their time of need.\n\n\nThe other day i woke up after hours and was shocked to see all this coming and when i put my finger up to it it started to vibrate. i looked at the other people i were talking to i was talking to the man who was talking with the other person and i noticed every time he touched me he would hit me for it. i feel that it would be such a great help. it may change your life forever. i also found that it could affect someone you love. it probably makes you happier when you share it with them. it could make your parents happy too. i hope it will help change everyone's lives again. eu we have to say that it will save some of the lives of those it's trying to help in their time of need. and if it will become so commonplace in everyday life, like this one, it does help. when i got very sick I found a whole new way to live. i feel that this is also something that can affect others. so hopefully we will see this changing as well. we will see the love this man has for his people every day.\n\n\nI wish i got this wrong because i could never live as well without it. i'm trying to help others. like many others, i feel that this would make the very world that you are helping, and I hope the rest of us will also help so that we too can experience love with each other. I am not a complete stranger, I've met people I am close to before and i think they are extremely caring. i will be especially happy if those with this experience could ever get close to you again.\n\ni think if it can cause people to love you, people won't be as lonely as others. we have to help them, because not all of us can. so if something can even make you feel better, it isn't something I am trying to do for everyone.\n\njust to note, i found this very inspiring and very important blogpost. so now i will post some ideas for a new project that we will cover over the next three month.\n\nIf you are reading this, go crazy and post your own idea below. I would love to see people sharing in the comments.\n\nIf you are seeing this one too often on Facebook, send me a message, I'll take it down.\n\n\nYou Might Also Like:\n\nHow to be a New Yorker (by E.M.

{"id":2095,"ended":true,"length":569,"gen_text":"Every time you fall asleep you immediately wake up in the middle of a historic battle as a random person, if your character dies you always wake up back in your bed next time you wake up in the middle of a historic battle. The other person will simply jump in and say hi and watch you wake up and you will be immediately back to normal. This makes a lot of sense but once you have that awareness you really become more aware of your surroundings so you can actually make any decision about using your skill on that fight much less be afraid to attack that other person.\n\n\nThis is another important reason behind being able to play with so many different people who can share the same skillset with you on a map. There are a lot of ways to create the same situation which can lead to different results. For example, a large group trying to kill another player would usually come into the middle with little idea what they can do but that really doesn't really matter and is generally what will lead to success, there are so many other ways to create situations such as this so I'm very much looking forward to getting more experience out of this in the next couple of pages. This will not only improve my knowledge, it will also help you in knowing what your next step might be.\n\n\nFinally the way to give the characters some unique feeling, which will lead them into different fight scenarios may be different than the standard \"magic trap\" where you just go to your room with a broom and then get swept away and throw it aside in panic. They could be the ones that find the magic items that can make them lose face like a bat-like creature or they could be the ones that try to get them stuck in a fight by taking items from other people. When looking at this scenario I feel that I must say that a lot of the time the characters will always find something that will make them fight and eventually they will find another way to save their identity. So by doing this the characters will not only take the battle out in a different manner but also can move even further away from their current group if you leave them at the same position.\n\n\nThere are tons of ways to use this skill. Whether something is your basic idea of how to use a skill or how to use something which has a different meaning, you have to experiment with it. When you get more advanced you will see different variations for different things depending on what you look at now and hopefully it will help to give a different edge to the players that you are trying to introduce and that will let them know you are thinking of new ways of doing things to play. I think it is worth seeing if it is something that you would really want to see more of to see if it does give you any more creative ideas.\n\n\nI hope this helps you when playing the game and there's much more to come.","token_len":580,"entropy":[5.307,1.5318,6.465,1.4286,2.3082,6.3186,2.2322,0.0495,2.5669,0.953,1.039,0.0063,1.8653,10.7103,3.3702,5.4459,2.4366,7.2438,3.8339,2.8136,5.84,4.1014,3.2791,3.1299,2.6669,5.5867,2.502,0.02,5.3257,0.7176,2.4975,3.7962,5.9116,3.1766,0.6698,2.6733,0.0241,1.9007,0.3966,0.0479,0.0062,0.3212,1.9163,0.0581,0.9481,3.0125,5.2761,2.2125,2.7856,5.1944,4.7807,2.1599,1.1647,3.5866,4.0362,1.3609,5.1898,0.4087,3.2222,0.0238,3.0382,2.5348,1.9929,2.0472,4.6953,3.8811,2.1737,1.3164,0.5819,2.4409,3.5805,3.4505,1.4807,0.0884,0.1038,3.7974,5.1009,0.3142,2.7336,3.6601,4.9417,1.6301,4.5937,3.8897,3.3879,1.6353,0.3492,1.507,0.6479,4.2117,0.9517,1.1866,2.9899,3.6866,4.4756,2.4643,3.1152,5.5091,1.165,5.3282,4.0809,2.255,6.1065,5.6594,3.5799,2.7058,3.189,0.9731,4.2671,4.0872,4.0853,0.2142,0.7739,2.721,0.0004,3.1815,1.043,4.4465,3.7111,4.4401,5.283,4.6939,0.7553,0.003,4.3369,2.8266,4.8871,0.182,0.78,3.2696,4.5337,2.5805,3.8705,2.118,0.0361,3.2901,4.7714,4.3654,0.7701,4.7374,1.3763,4.5111,0.664,3.7086,0.46,2.0628,0.4604,0.0391,3.4939,0.5069,4.3399,3.7948,2.1249,4.2714,4.7749,2.1704,3.1122,0.0776,2.3907,1.487,0.9188,2.8948,0.277,1.0319,3.3807,5.4613,1.6026,7.0941,0.0277,2.7287,3.8201,1.7487,3.7503,3.5305,4.8368,3.3367,1.305,2.195,5.7748,5.5007,4.1584,1.7839,1.6774,3.9955,0.2478,3.1625,3.9044,5.4218,2.0712,0.0004,3.5456,0.2882,3.1749,3.5689,5.3601,3.8372,3.8173,2.1232,0.1074,2.8524,4.4104,4.5342,0.8324,3.2277,0.0149,2.5557,0.9883,0.5606,1.2852,2.7844,3.7836,0.0071,2.6039,4.7339,2.1923,2.8568,4.7725,2.8042,0.9669,0.0872,0.0035,4.4167,1.535,2.5033,2.851,0.0339,0.774,4.2908,0.5762,3.8889,3.159,0.2102,5.059,0.3652,4.7716,2.7019,5.0294,1.3331,3.1649,1.4512,3.829,3.4271,1.0903,0.211,0.5142,1.5633,3.1354,2.8009,5.2503,1.6431,3.186,3.6218,2.8592,3.4244,0.0682,1.1217,0.8301,0.0003,4.3944,4.2637,5.0003,1.6756,5.17,3.1412,3.9598,3.4915,3.4677,4.2798,3.3902,4.4611,2.8947,3.6114,1.7066,2.326,1.8258,4.8269,1.7806,5.6564,0.9206,1.8923,2.2935,1.844,5.0563,3.7004,5.5997,5.9692,0.2616,4.0632,0.8213,2.6681,3.3129,1.8893,2.5003,2.3894,3.758,1.5867,5.8001,0.6986,3.2148,4.4545,5.8431,1.3227,2.3481,5.3582,2.5848,5.3649,4.0286,6.0671,0.566,6.1361,3.607,2.0113,4.095,2.7158,1.6729,4.8721,1.8779,1.8303,5.5045,2.2704,3.426,2.8671,0.7671,4.7901,5.5994,5.4498,2.5198,5.1881,6.1056,1.7902,1.8572,1.3403,2.0536,0.0763,0.2436,0.8304,0.1032,0.4661,4.0575,0.1965,2.9089,3.2267,5.0625,0.7373,1.0466,3.2525,3.0536,4.4658,5.0629,1.1327,2.7659,1.6428,1.7547,5.1986,5.3714,0.4293,2.1232,2.4169,1.4603,3.2543,1.9665,2.6196,5.8823,2.3161,0.3807,4.4925,0.3759,0.0472,1.3159,2.5828,2.0545,1.1221,1.331,4.1184,2.8798,1.4919,1.4582,1.9432,1.5966,0.1025,3.4424,2.5935,4.9831,2.0127,0.3892,2.6913,5.0161,1.5532,0.39,5.6769,1.1433,6.0706,0.9371,3.7546,5.4367,3.7334,0.3825,3.7203,0.9646,1.048,3.5133,1.1847,5.4866,2.1762,5.1742,4.77,2.7588,1.5581,1.7848,3.4814,0.45,1.6636,5.2339,4.8661,5.8551,1.4215,2.7022,0.1599,2.3578,3.1494,5.5467,3.9081,3.7905,5.3959,0.5344,3.8177,1.7446,1.5004,3.919,0.9043,1.0736,0.0003,4.0835,0.5134,4.6879,0.1993,2.2276,0.3491,3.7328,1.4091,1.765,2.9723,5.7085,7.5953,0.8608,4.331,4.0107,5.9654,0.8096,1.5294,0.187,0.9511,2.8313,0.3871,0.5308,3.7701,0.5465,1.405,3.8369,4.8221,3.1874,1.7437,2.5423,2.7762,2.5737,2.0848,3.2855,0.5836,5.1215,0.8879,1.4587,1.7406,4.237,1.1873,3.1449,4.1654,4.5544,0.699,1.0417,2.5591,3.1692,3.6096,5.0337,1.3515,2.5555,4.1105,0.0431,1.2253,0.698,5.1045,1.6382,6.9387,1.4888,5.3185,2.9525,0.2608,1.6385,3.3043,2.4769,2.5677,2.9843,5.6272,0.437,1.4953,2.8117,2.1185,1.2178,1.7997,1.5605,0.0185,4.1033,4.0776,3.8557,2.2481,5.039,0.9232,1.4488,2.6455,1.006,4.2561,1.7857,2.7885,1.2615,1.8786,2.0489,0.6765,3.8114,4.6978,2.1318,2.6028,2.656,1.8917,1.2222,4.8441,5.8402,2.2173,2.797,2.1289,2.4953,0.7968,1.0417,3.101,3.4893,1.8387,0.1212,2.815,3.608,0.3427,4.9426,1.035,1.29,1.2593,3.793,3.6115,0.3284,2.6192,2.2226,5.4142,1.8273,1.0702,0.8019,0.0003,2.4605,1.4257,0.9571,1.9334,1.6488,4.972,2.2005,3.0254,0.6616,0.9255,5.7437,3.746,4.6511,0.3551,0.881,0.8686,1.2153]}
{"id":298,"ended":true,"length":557,"gen_text":"You are the architect of the universe, and you're having a really bad day at work.\n\n\"It was only a year ago that I worked with the folks at B&H in Boston and they offered me a job there and we signed you for three to four years, it was hard work and we were on the verge of making really good deals right now.\n\n\"When I was in Australia, I was looking for a house, I came across a lovely lady and she gave me a job for $40,000. The problem was she was a professional with more than one client. The real problem was I had a client who was having multiple work with him. A couple of weeks later he called me and says he asked what was up and I asked him to give away five thousand dollars. It was amazing! When I told him it would really help him, it got him thinking about working with other people, there are so many people out there who are working really hard so I said 'I won't work with anybody. I want to help you.'\n\n\"I was so happy to have a deal, like I didn't have a contract from when I was very young. I knew where the money came from but I did it by luck which was so important!\"\n\nShe said: \"I had already had my first meeting with the other two people and they had always done really well on their terms and they'd got two days' advice. The two of them had never done an episode before and now they were like two days into it and he said 'You know what? I'd get my money back and I'd go see my friends on our trip in Germany.'\n\n\"I said at my first meeting, 'Hey, I know what's happening I don't want to go do it again. No way. I'd be out of time'.\"\n\nThe couple will now be allowed two more work sessions, where she will also be happy to take up the offer of their life's work.\n\n\"I have said over and over again not to spend my time wasting because if something happens, I'd be very happy and I wouldn't be doing that again.\"\n\nThe wife of the late Robert Foulkes, said: \"It is all about family. We had a good time in our wedding, the kids had a great time and we now really want to go over and do it again. It's going to be an exciting year. I would love to see people work together to create that opportunity.\"\n\nThe marriage ended in 2007 when Paul stepped down as president of B&H to take the reins. The couple had two children together.\n\nPaul Foulkes\n\nThe couple also have a couple of TV show on the air on their television channel which is also based on their TV series.","token_len":580,"entropy":[3.8828,3.2036,6.8724,0.4688,1.3254,4.8225,1.4951,1.5681,1.4285,3.3751,7.047,1.1414,4.3209,2.0804,0.6903,3.2486,0.2807,0.7634,2.0322,0.0027,2.6091,3.022,3.3675,4.5595,1.6245,4.3839,0.382,0.7381,0.8516,5.4896,2.3954,2.3745,6.3451,0.4454,5.6804,3.3969,0.659,3.252,4.3575,2.348,1.2641,4.504,0.532,0.7396,0.9169,4.5037,2.8973,3.4459,4.668,3.4831,3.5035,3.8195,3.8467,1.2,0.4463,2.3498,4.973,0.578,5.4067,1.3563,2.2002,2.6104,1.6945,4.4457,1.0556,1.8082,0.0117,3.9105,6.4146,1.3171,4.2128,6.2759,2.7126,0.8936,1.4648,0.0004,0.0507,3.7546,0.9554,2.313,2.3862,5.5701,1.1622,1.0328,1.474,3.8238,0.8439,0.7196,5.9234,2.1965,1.4786,4.0135,0.7529,1.1017,4.1859,4.1716,2.3436,0.729,3.0993,0.0262,0.6551,1.408,3.8347,3.1777,3.6317,0.433,0.0094,1.2461,3.8453,5.0751,0.4735,2.4684,1.4429,2.0258,5.1127,4.3011,5.5665,0.8875,2.3053,4.3423,1.2298,3.7075,4.1792,0.4733,0.298,2.667,1.8733,2.1333,2.5029,1.0954,0.8876,4.974,6.3025,5.8121,5.7599,2.3859,1.5307,5.8475,2.0781,0.3924,1.4249,0.5825,1.8863,3.7067,0.6681,0.7073,5.411,0.9759,6.0549,3.8305,1.9832,2.6328,1.3476,1.1838,4.2499,0.9402,2.167,3.5586,8.0449,4.6567,2.492,0.3521,1.069,3.3588,0.4331,4.6991,4.1117,5.269,0.7155,2.5783,0.0982,3.0377,3.3435,5.7801,1.3398,1.511,1.4925,3.3753,3.8448,1.5848,2.2316,0.5823,4.9835,0.5049,2.6232,0.5218,2.2856,5.4971,1.7671,1.6911,0.0189,1.5144,1.1506,0.008,0.879,1.2318,3.0958,2.9461,0.1153,5.5969,1.5848,3.5822,2.3972,2.002,5.1973,0.0029,3.3154,0.2937,3.0343,3.0388,0.8423,2.5238,0.5314,2.1945,0.9244,2.1899,1.1486,0.0002,0.0384,1.2656,2.1668,2.4931,1.7043,1.962,2.2081,2.3161,5.3152,2.5317,5.9637,1.55,5.0753,0.0006,2.0637,1.7864,2.6388,4.9275,5.2591,0.0766,0.2724,5.2319,0.106,1.0399,0.9576,3.9151,5.2878,2.2005,0.8034,2.73,0.0089,2.6632,0.7469,4.4239,1.9638,3.85,5.829,6.2479,1.3889,4.9801,3.7263,6.1379,0.2601,0.0003,5.2169,2.6472,2.0639,0.0238,0.8442,2.616,4.7266,3.1246,2.5608,1.2472,3.9496,0.2167,1.6198,4.1353,4.2202,1.7441,2.127,1.447,2.836,5.4878,4.6004,3.4593,0.6742,4.735,1.9452,4.0407,1.7512,2.4873,4.2354,4.7908,5.5968,5.8185,3.0091,7.2189,2.1998,3.7225,3.9453,0.9423,0.4922,2.3103,3.364,2.594,4.7331,4.9443,1.6027,1.0269,4.5872,0.8776,1.2809,4.1706,4.6747,1.8482,3.7864,1.4399,1.3003,5.0692,1.6596,0.4472,3.1671,1.7328,0.7785,1.3094,1.2105,3.2027,4.9764,3.5998,1.4938,0.7025,2.182,1.1176,0.5277,3.3341,4.6187,2.3158,3.6425,4.4994,5.2509,3.1951,3.7548,4.6536,1.9887,0.6691,0.0002,0.032,1.0586,1.9388,7.4027,4.9777,0.8391,0.5928,2.8164,0.5148,4.7564,0.7776,1.5288,2.616,2.0859,2.8998,2.5439,6.2206,3.2657,0.0003,1.097,0.3309,2.5243,5.4093,1.6521,1.5583,1.5597,5.8069,2.5847,2.3809,0.9319,2.4647,2.3263,3.4904,0.6592,4.8307,3.9029,0.2165,0.0002,2.5653,3.0579,4.9791,2.2814,2.0587,4.4293,3.8687,2.7769,5.9695,3.3039,2.5362,4.7831,3.5577,0.9721,3.7176,1.3991,6.1455,0.1321,3.7013,3.5831,1.7259,2.2465,1.7815,5.4542,4.7045,2.5582,0.1891,0.8277,0.3394,0.0002,1.7565,0.9357,3.013,5.6678,4.9919,0.425,0.0013,0.6896,5.9463,0.0308,5.3317,1.9491,0.8802,5.6254,5.0565,3.5614,5.1637,1.1349,1.8385,0.9361,3.4086,1.7804,3.8733,0.8066,2.5832,1.3516,2.45,0.0004,1.7386,2.7068,2.4803,3.398,2.9676,0.6848,0.0002,2.377,6.1602,0.8008,2.3814,2.7095,5.3194,4.1858,5.6784,0.1109,0.5712,5.1098,0.4515,0.0024,2.0893,2.2829,5.1076,1.1425,4.2788,1.2914,2.4071,4.0127,0.9452,3.2574,1.2742,2.6328,3.376,3.4566,2.0944,3.5164,3.31,3.3626,1.0429,1.4946,0.1436,1.1804,1.7649,5.4011,5.72,1.8872,0.2342,3.2705,6.0105,1.4377,1.9524,2.2044,0.3426,0.603,2.8841,0.8562,4.1574,0.0396,0.159,3.5566,2.3649,2.4555,2.2865,2.3622,3.7878,0.881,0.2683,2.4112,3.9609,4.3152,1.3556,2.5878,2.9788,5.0256,5.4177,1.3467,0.8436,0.0002,1.7711,5.4644,4.406,0.6571,3.6549,2.0762,6.6651,6.042,0.1376,0.7042,3.2176,0.1968,1.0274,0.0554,0.0026,4.3213,1.6944,3.0756,1.7114,2.0667,3.3091,0.5063,2.8794,2.2908,0.5082,1.0521,2.3274,0.7092,0.0003,3.1333,4.5991,0.0065,0.0031,3.0032,0.0002,2.0639,1.1996,3.8002,1.2681,1.0143,4.4662,0.1463,5.5577,4.1033,5.0807,1.6707,3.0123,4.124,3.9556,4.7042,1.2697,3.5456,1.8685,3.6614,3.3597,1.5584,1.6917,3.4373,1.8493,0.9171]}

The problem is I think that there's way not that many people read this.\n\nI made some changes in R2 and was very happy with what I got:\n\n1. Use the standard R 2:print function. This is more compact, and can be used for quick and dirty formatting.\n\n2. Use the standard SCL library I used in pfSense : print_substitutions and stdin, respectively, so that some of R2's code can be converted to stdin and then used for more control.\n\n3. Use NFS for more writing efficiency (if you have support for this): a very nice filesystem with all of these good features.\n\n4.

{"id":3929,"ended":false,"length":514,"gen_text":"You're a low-ranking officer on a space ship. Everybody above you in the chain of command is dead or incapacitated. It's time you learn the ship's secret. \" 'Captain' was in the dock when she learned of the mission.\n\n'The people of Golarion have chosen the captain and she has chosen 'Captain'. \"\n\nIt was reported that the Enterprise's life support systems required an additional three life support systems.\n\nThe Enterprise is the only example of an Enterprise ship on the Romulan universe to be able to sustain life-saving services in the universe's first interplanetary colony. On the other hand, the Enterprise's first homeworld, Kestiria is only 500 years into the future with only 4 life replicators aboard, which is more than two times the age of the first interplanetary colony.\n\nIt is thought that this was due to the large amount of space debris found on the surface and the long history between the Romulan and Federation colonies.\n\nIt is possible that the Enterprise made some of the closest contact with a living person during its time on the planet of Endor. A similar scenario is also suggested. Interestingly, however, when the alien race of the Klingon Empire conquered Kestiria, they were discovered to be the aliens of the planet, which was then colonized with the Klingons under the name of \"Siberian Dominion\".\n\nIt is thought that the planet's history may have held the key to its survival in time. It could be the reason that the Romulans created a colony on the planet to support it after it fell under the control of the Klingon Empire, as it survived until then and was the sole colony on Endor. When their forces arrived, the Klingons did send troops into a large amount of space, to stop the Klingons from colonizing the planet and eventually end its existence.\n\n. It is believed that the Enterprise was the last surviving ship of the original Vulcan crew after the Enterprise-B went down with the Enterprise-D, as it was found dead in its hangar bay in the 2375 BBY.\n\nIt is possible that the Enterprise's crew made some sort of contact with a Human or some other kind of life form on the planet, which is also possible. There are theories as to whether the creature is the first known life form who actually gave his name as Spock, but we will not ever know for sure. The creature is described as \"numerous\" in the Star Trek Encyclopedia, although this is probably some sort of exaggeration for this information to be used in the story.\n\nIn one of the films, after the Battle of Endor, Spock (played by actor Patrick Stewart) told a very interesting story, suggesting that the creature was actually an alien.\n\nExternal link Edit","token_len":580,"entropy":[5.2846,2.8428,7.3344,0.6873,4.3244,3.0952,3.6768,1.7817,7.1719,2.5747,1.6922,7.6571,9.4683,0.5143,4.8764,1.0917,5.446,0.3682,0.0053,1.5589,5.7176,3.7277,4.1852,0.0016,0.6593,3.2837,0.3522,3.3985,2.2786,5.4985,2.7837,6.6813,0.6207,5.3657,1.909,4.2835,7.3475,6.0381,1.6786,4.2764,4.7675,1.5332,5.3827,2.6837,4.2046,4.6797,1.92,0.9128,4.0789,0.8811,4.219,0.0068,2.8665,3.2668,6.3247,2.6016,5.6278,2.9256,0.0201,2.5071,4.7922,2.8328,4.4909,3.4503,3.4094,1.961,1.743,5.164,1.6422,2.4008,3.6874,0.9256,0.0003,5.233,2.1682,5.381,0.7037,1.5419,5.334,2.4433,5.9001,0.1184,1.0283,6.1601,2.924,2.8417,4.0344,4.2711,0.2842,0.6523,1.7928,1.4258,0.0002,2.0109,2.0985,3.5912,2.464,1.1146,6.3913,0.157,2.2159,2.224,2.407,4.6496,1.4348,3.4381,0.0051,0.0217,4.7568,0.8235,2.0332,2.8285,0.0126,3.6478,0.803,3.2542,3.7309,4.0126,3.3788,1.731,5.5624,3.0276,3.0148,4.823,0.819,0.0001,2.2639,0.5676,5.6608,1.4325,1.8572,0.1233,0.0285,1.0454,1.7225,1.9961,3.5132,5.7258,0.0034,1.0238,3.5488,5.6434,2.5813,0.1923,4.5432,3.2523,5.603,1.4757,3.0139,1.4821,1.7983,5.3617,1.9356,4.6967,2.8537,6.3906,0.0688,3.6959,2.2397,3.0054,1.8527,3.7553,0.0972,3.6335,1.222,0.4968,3.3542,0.1351,0.7072,3.4843,3.5729,0.0062,0.0003,0.2126,0.5956,0.5568,0.0002,3.5435,0.6377,4.7575,0.1823,3.8575,2.3964,1.4974,0.0447,0.596,5.2878,1.9001,0.007,3.3109,2.1484,3.4029,1.1424,0.5693,2.2201,4.0657,1.08,5.6568,3.3661,2.6613,0.6401,2.8783,0.0017,0.4592,1.1992,1.6693,3.8621,0.6682,0.7531,0.0002,2.5549,0.5053,2.4972,0.1662,0.7731,1.5488,5.6312,3.8364,2.9831,0.7957,6.0402,0.5398,0.3436,2.9003,3.949,3.1816,2.9774,0.8811,2.7064,0.6736,0.7635,1.497,3.471,4.5121,0.0026,0.8761,4.8263,4.2352,2.9269,1.6244,1.2279,3.3886,2.3558,7.4496,0.1711,5.5162,0.0111,4.0784,0.973,6.7658,3.3025,2.9508,1.7914,4.196,0.3122,4.8676,1.5849,0.4733,0.0036,0.0046,0.8541,1.6579,2.316,5.6238,0.804,0.7218,3.2103,5.227,1.1458,0.8101,2.363,1.9848,2.3519,1.9481,2.852,4.1228,0.2801,4.9589,0.9175,3.3634,0.0135,5.0172,0.5239,2.5757,0.5716,2.5305,4.084,3.6011,0.6157,5.524,0.599,0.6023,0.0002,2.0201,0.3034,3.8782,0.0801,0.7188,5.2203,2.4809,4.278,3.4551,0.4631,5.685,2.0721,1.1314,0.093,2.7459,1.8793,3.0561,4.9453,0.8632,2.7067,4.0226,1.5365,3.1494,2.9159,1.0489,0.7975,2.3327,0.0025,0.6989,4.9695,1.4815,2.0127,1.118,0.9524,0.2768,3.2014,4.2168,4.1213,3.5511,2.523,2.9358,2.1787,0.4335,1.0575,0.0063,0.3873,1.6354,0.1454,2.0003,2.9718,2.4343,5.8851,3.9335,4.8166,2.8839,1.8287,3.9167,4.184,1.6317,0.8497,1.5279,0.0025,0.7225,5.9368,5.6196,4.6467,3.3916,1.4932,1.217,2.2005,0.0065,4.9995,6.5625,5.5617,2.6815,4.7442,4.3658,4.8783,0.0027,0.3431,1.4848,3.343,3.0576,0.517,2.5417,0.0044,0.5238,4.1182,0.0706,0.8098,0.3031,2.6961,3.4732,4.9183,2.8432,1.1301,0.3261,0.6976,0.0002,8.2284,3.6223,0.3258,2.0596,0.0793,0.6442,1.5439,1.557,2.2591,2.2022,2.5861,2.9983,1.3941,0.3835,4.2863,4.9701,2.5239,4.0873,0.9042,4.4534,1.1915,2.7514,4.4599,1.0781,3.9223,0.5903,2.2101,0.6454,0.7203,2.7961,2.6388,1.0153,0.9904,4.4255,5.2121,1.4679,2.5342,2.3923,2.4315,2.9855,1.3247,3.8782,7.493,4.7975,0.003,0.4316,0.6196,0.0002,1.6559,0.3447,2.0294,0.0782,0.5549,1.2078,2.1459,2.8605,5.2587,1.7433,4.1078,0.0006,2.1258,0.0635,1.4327,5.597,3.476,4.1402,0.4844,3.9793,0.0395,1.9179,0.684,2.6592,0.6923,0.2762,2.131,2.2639,1.8977,2.0116,2.5869,0.5072,5.1489,1.1659,4.1912,1.7926,0.0086,2.7788,1.2436,5.6689,3.8541,2.1971,4.1033,3.5619,2.6473,0.1854,5.3717,4.5467,5.2791,5.0092,0.332,2.3425,3.7942,1.4756,2.8082,4.6176,3.6564,1.2921,4.9498,0.0846,1.1015,0.2454,0.2138,3.0734,2.6428,2.1005,3.3583,0.2366,2.6717,5.3572,3.3108,1.1405,1.4178,0.8031,2.6904,0.008,1.188,1.2808,3.3331,2.4653,1.1117,2.7525,5.8639,1.5602,0.0044,6.0472,4.5654,3.0992,5.2681,1.8199,0.671,3.0482,1.4001,1.6803,2.9079,0.4303,0.4895,0.0002,2.9764,3.4467,1.1627,0.2152,4.6561,0.4122,4.5292,0.9123,4.8004,0.0309,0.2454,0.0002,0.2644,2.8587,4.841,1.6447,0.0248,4.0023,4.9977,0.0072,0.1117,4.8039,1.9159,5.0022,2.8662,0.1756,3.1826,5.0827,0.2273,1.1023,4.1858,1.3767,2.6471,2.7988,1.2901,1.8611,1.505,0.0002,4.0583,0.0015,0.0011]}

{"id":4931,"ended":false,"length":535,"gen_text":"Earth has been conquered by aliens, Humanity is resisting and dying. Cthulhu comes to the rescue.\n\nNecromancers (no pun intended) are the beings of the Necromantic Order. In short: Necromancers are evil and want to keep everyone alive in their time of need as long as humans keep on killing those who oppose them. Necromancers are all about control and fear of any threat.\n\nThese are the main races of the game, and that's it. The game is completely new to us, so we're happy with what has been set up. Everything that we've covered is covered on the site. There are a lot of new races, the old ones that don't have long to run on. As a result more old races are created, and they come into play with new classes, talents, and abilities. This really goes into what it means to run the game. As part of our development philosophy we created the following content:\n\n* A new map with a world map with unique environments. Also, a world map for the world of the Necromancers as it's set in 3D.\n\n* 2 new playable monsters. No longer do we use the old monsters to give the characters some unique combat, which will change from experience to experience now.\n\n* New game modes. We want every character to have an amazing time with players.\n\n* Play the game at 30 fps in 4K instead of at 30 as in previous versions.\n\n* Game crashes with no warning\/errata due to missing assets. It has very high stability, and no graphical glitches caused by the game changing from 1080p to 1920p.\n\nNote: Due to the size of the game, all content is a matter of opinion. I didn't think this is important to say anything, but you can read more about that on\n\nThe game will feature a game mode set out in a world for the Necromantic Order. In it, you won't be able to take control over the Necromancers at their own accord. We are hoping that they will create the world of the new Necremacists. This isn't what you see in the original campaign, but it's possible that you will be able to take action from within the world. We hope that this can be a game where the world's inhabitants come together and decide what to do with the time they have left. As a community we want to create an inclusive community for the players to see their own world to play in.\n\nAs part of our community, players that want to play the game of the Necromancers can choose to support the guilds that they join. As all of these players are new to the game, there's much to do on the main game's \"main menu\".

{"id":1738,"ended":true,"length":539,"gen_text":"Humans are the first intelligent beings in the universe. It is our duty to guide those that come after us.\n\nGod has promised us eternal life in Paradise and eternal bliss. We do not forget our responsibility as animals to provide for us.\n\nWe are the sons and daughters of God. All human life is created into sin and thus we shall become worthless and defiled. In all time and place we have suffered.\n\nIt is a truth that all have sinned so surely that they will repent, and so it was that Moses commanded all His prophets to bear the guilt of all who were disobedient, and he said to them: \" It is easier to bear our sins than it is to bear our debt.\". Moses further says:. God himself said: \" Let us be the heirs of our sins, for this ye will possess.\" ( Deut. 23:1, 11 and 13; Isaiah 3:1, 2 ) We are descended from the Father and are partakers of God's seed.\n\nWe are His children. We are His sons. We are His children. This is not to say that we were not aware of the fact that God had promised our children full dominion over our living bodies.\n\nLet us be free from sin, which will set you free.\n\nIt is easy for us to go free from sin.. If we don't obey the Spirit we will die.\n\nWe should not be in debt to one another that we are not living together. God gave His children an opportunity to work for His kingdom and reward His servants. It is very easy for you to give up and let loose the passions of sin.\n\nGod did not tell His children to live like animals and that they deserved better from their mothers. God didn't tell His infants that they needed to feed their infants properly.\n\nMan should seek refuge under the covers of the shadow of God.\n\nWe are our children. He told his children that when they are old they will be free from sin.\n\nWe are His servants; God taught us not to follow the one God who has made the world His own and gave the commandment that men should live according to their own desires.\n\nThe Lord gave He His people a chance to do what He had done to them.\n\nThe Lord said unto them: \" Give me thy people over. They shall do what thou wilt want of me. If thy people do not turn, my Lord, I will send thine people unto you to do that which I want thy people to do.\"\n\nThere was good hope and glory of God, but he gave it no support.\n\nYou are my children; all of you are my children, who also have the knowledge of your God and your God also will serve you ( Deut. 23:11-12 ).","token_len":584,"entropy":[7.039,1.7652,3.416,3.0631,5.8256,2.983,3.0216,0.9397,0.6661,1.1914,3.8128,0.846,4.0159,2.8293,0.2224,4.1212,4.557,2.6414,3.4835,2.4624,0.1451,1.1488,1.691,0.0115,4.9694,2.5117,5.052,1.1583,4.313,0.1659,2.7481,4.769,2.312,3.6398,2.6043,1.6665,2.2301,3.7988,0.1595,5.9822,2.4584,3.3934,2.5728,5.0156,1.0167,4.0447,0.9738,3.0537,0.7876,1.6279,0.0002,1.8695,1.4893,2.1087,5.1125,0.978,0.0231,0.0216,0.3175,0.9524,4.2637,4.3591,2.9658,0.6776,2.4214,5.4116,6.5954,1.3194,5.6977,1.5656,5.5915,4.5357,5.621,1.8047,5.1373,0.2902,0.5558,4.7189,3.9373,5.8985,2.6076,2.3068,1.1491,2.2713,3.8949,3.4606,1.574,0.0002,4.2367,0.1502,3.7562,5.4427,0.5642,2.9094,4.2994,1.0735,0.0028,4.7026,6.8003,1.242,1.6186,2.081,4.2778,2.7945,1.5986,3.8986,3.3424,3.8033,0.9376,3.892,3.8815,3.3101,5.3604,2.6322,0.3961,5.2108,2.2718,3.0293,0.2392,2.2432,2.6402,2.8006,5.7632,0.0196,3.2999,1.2725,3.8967,2.4694,1.452,0.9347,1.5736,0.7625,11.5687,0.1857,4.7147,1.0585,1.7861,6.1566,0.1965,0.2306,1.8796,0.0298,0.1942,0.5378,1.1887,5.8053,0.7221,8.6423,5.0209,4.9306,3.7781,0.5533,10.3762,4.9681,5.584,2.2404,0.6814,0.2886,4.1706,1.2525,3.1065,3.6529,4.2254,0.1612,1.0971,0.4029,1.1977,2.7444,3.892,6.0491,2.1947,6.0587,1.9309,1.813,6.8946,0.4937,0.4506,3.6005,0.0212,3.3297,3.1241,4.1342,5.3777,2.2548,2.6553,5.3265,3.8727,0.0023,2.7847,1.3938,2.4898,4.6299,3.5814,1.4648,5.6627,0.0875,1.2299,2.1283,1.4272,2.05,4.9387,0.7013,0.1194,4.1346,0.1357,4.4924,0.4989,1.2853,0.0002,1.9023,0.6913,4.7527,1.2774,1.5653,1.2275,0.5584,1.0666,3.1533,1.8029,0.746,0.1642,0.4488,1.6868,1.288,5.0528,0.4448,3.9066,2.3048,0.9483,0.2326,0.7542,4.932,2.4029,5.4774,0.3122,1.3937,1.9971,0.1829,1.8661,2.4347,2.0568,3.6035,1.4271,6.3191,4.4692,0.2874,1.9779,6.5699,1.6097,1.027,1.8971,0.0002,5.3082,0.2671,2.2953,5.6344,0.7286,1.0983,1.7365,4.1711,3.672,5.9352,1.9663,0.1904,1.5815,1.8465,0.0002,3.1505,0.1779,4.4623,1.3807,0.8455,0.1416,4.9759,5.5386,1.018,0.1874,10.2187,4.4421,0.4979,3.986,0.0013,4.6354,1.9458,4.6638,2.4904,0.4475,3.1738,0.5548,1.1549,0.0002,2.07,3.8415,1.7677,1.5015,3.6563,3.4882,0.5076,3.1302,0.1691,6.8166,0.9193,2.8433,1.1896,4.3587,4.3527,0.7285,3.5243,3.5758,3.3023,0.8225,3.9127,1.9513,0.2299,5.6677,2.3206,1.8728,2.1513,1.9481,5.9932,2.3705,2.3885,0.8254,3.5866,0.509,4.6046,1.2034,0.5559,4.5556,0.1984,4.5103,1.4884,4.3578,3.6289,3.4963,3.4638,5.0676,1.2083,2.7431,0.8317,0.9401,0.0002,2.8571,3.8697,0.1318,4.2554,2.4117,0.4485,0.7192,3.0925,2.6333,1.8041,2.1689,2.88,0.8032,6.8921,3.1641,3.6036,2.4135,3.9459,0.6688,2.6105,4.2247,0.0008,0.7717,0.4677,6.9017,2.3441,0.4914,3.4322,0.627,4.6837,1.3703,4.1677,5.1155,0.7733,1.4786,0.0002,5.8536,2.6347,6.1404,4.8151,5.3918,0.9788,5.4734,0.0724,1.2048,5.1447,0.1612,3.2087,0.8333,0.8659,0.0002,2.1928,1.6858,4.1334,1.817,0.7074,4.5719,4.5717,4.6371,0.7263,1.1495,4.6115,0.7472,2.1089,1.8452,1.0897,0.8145,1.1856,1.8201,0.8792,0.5221,0.6127,1.1859,0.0002,1.6602,0.5626,0.6964,3.5939,5.1183,3.3336,4.4245,0.4669,3.5679,0.0095,4.7244,1.4468,5.4704,3.8344,1.2081,2.697,2.593,3.2273,0.4411,3.7427,0.8739,2.694,4.1536,3.5357,5.5577,0.3652,1.6614,3.9441,0.2791,2.704,1.5653,0.0052,1.5036,0.778,2.218,0.4968,0.613,0.0002,2.9502,2.1501,3.3082,5.0357,2.9789,2.8778,1.6678,3.3,0.188,3.5779,1.8749,0.6061,1.7267,2.8914,2.2896,1.5855,0.8359,1.5625,0.0002,2.5202,0.9491,2.9611,2.991,1.1396,0.297,1.2926,4.9627,1.2398,2.7279,2.8298,5.8383,5.9431,3.6877,0.5028,3.9826,0.55,0.9452,0.4483,0.0092,4.7324,4.1236,0.6623,1.131,3.6651,4.5524,0.331,1.6685,1.0204,4.8942,4.0819,3.5442,4.3914,0.4665,1.461,0.1138,3.3279,3.0763,0.2603,3.2417,3.6198,2.1369,3.6715,1.0217,3.0124,0.1694,2.2105,3.7301,4.4899,0.0492,0.1955,0.0263,1.0025,1.6847,0.0003,4.4914,2.1317,7.1296,4.3819,2.4543,5.0822,4.3042,1.0965,3.0094,1.5457,3.5965,2.9343,2.2525,3.4687,4.5957,0.3901,0.8328,0.0002,4.6624,2.1311,3.1197,0.9927,1.9557,5.755,1.5211,0.5205,0.6832,0.718,0.874,2.681,4.0513,5.987,1.8078,1.7489,4.6116,0.7308,4.17,3.6841,1.6519,3.4069,1.4641,5.8575,4.6114,5.0162,0.3021,5.6723,1.6446,0.0199,0.0685,2.1287,0.0033,3.2893,1.9982,1.0323,1.0586]}
{"id":4116,"ended":false,"length":558,"gen_text":"Describe Jeff Goldblum's face in words.\n\nGoldblum has been mentioned in countless films, many of them featuring men like Bruce Willis. In 2003 he debuted his documentary, \"The Death of Jim Shooter,\" in which he details a murder that could have been avoided with an easier story line. According to Goldblum, his book is the book.\n\nHe also tells the tale of four men he befriended that got into trouble for having his photo taken with his friend. The men were named as Jack, Joryon and Larry. Jack would later write on a diary that he kept with his mother with a picture of him with a black belt:\n\nJack was a long time friend of mine, and I'd love to keep her record of this little incident without them getting arrested. But I wish I'd never got caught. We were always very, very close. We'd often talk, and my mum would call us home during the day, and say 'I found yourself alone with a man you thought you knew, who was not as nice as I was like last time. But he was a wonderful man. No one would ever know where he was from.'\"\n\nIt has been revealed that the two men had been lovers for many years, although Goldblum doesn't say who it was. He said:\n\nThe relationship we shared was the same at that point in time. They could never live as they did together. And that's where I came in to come out at that time. It was when the book started that I remembered my old relationship with my father. He had become a very popular dude in New York, but he didn't want his people to see him in the movies. When he saw that me doing my thing, my dad took me out to see him, and he was so impressed with the guy I looked up to. The only time that I think he said 'You know what, you may as well start taking me out to meet people.'\"\n\nGoldblum says not all of the men mentioned in his book took their romance seriously. The couple got divorced in 1994, but did eventually agree on a new wife, Mary Jane.

{"id":1523,"ended":true,"length":556,"gen_text":"You die and find yourself in Valhalla, where all great warriors go when they die. However, you never fought a day in your life. You try to find out why you're there. You never go to sleep in the night.\n\n\nIt's better to be alive today because of the sacrifice of all things. It should never be to you for that to happen.\n\n\n\"The time comes when you have to take responsibility for your future life.\n\n\n\"You feel trapped inside of the heart of this people, and you fight like it's your job to save them.\"\n\n\nWe're all victims of our environment. The problem of air pollution has devastated people who were exposed to it. While we're on the subject of air pollution, the Environmental Protection Agency acknowledges the fact that we are under one of the highest environmental damage factors found in the world with over 100,000 people living in US cities. The EPA also estimates that air pollution causes serious health problems, including asthma, lung disease, cardiovascular disease, infertility and more.\n\n\nBut the EPA's goal is to keep you out of the world.\n\n\nThey've learned the difference in how you feel and when you feel. You should not feel angry, angry, angry. You should not feel disappointed.\n\n\n\"I'm living my old life, even after I'm diagnosed with cancer which will set you right.\"\n\n\nI think I love the thought of my children living an incredible life!\n\n\nThe health of the Earth is very important to us. It makes us so proud, even more so as they find meaning in life that they will never have.\n\n\nEvery year, we're reminded of our role as a society in caring for, and understanding each other. We're not concerned, so to live in this world we live in is the responsibility of the Earth as a whole. We don't simply put up with bad air and we don't let our emotions dictate how we live our lives.\n\n\nThe environment will not change what you consider good, so it should be treated as good when you are free from this polluted world.\n\n\nLet us live in the spirit of God, because not all will look at God's way when the day comes.\n\n\n\"What if I die in my sleep? Let me stay dead, not be afraid.\n\n\n\" The day you die, your life will be over.\"\n\n\nThe problem that has become of the world's poor is our problem of air pollution. The Air Pollution Law says that pollution can only be eliminated by addressing certain issues. For some, breathing air is not a health problem, it's a personal or societal problem.\n\n\nThere are good charities and programs that can help you overcome our pollution problem. We hope that a few of the listed charities will be able to provide an atmosphere that will promote compassion and love in the face of this pollution.","token_len":589,"entropy":[8.7887,3.2812,5.3725,2.9594,1.5082,7.1049,1.4558,2.6251,3.6185,7.7464,5.3357,5.163,5.1204,0.7518,1.7157,1.0405,5.6357,0.1081,2.1908,3.5623,9.8807,2.1658,5.1809,1.9965,0.7932,0.116,1.5175,1.3637,6.5621,0.3954,3.1319,2.6352,2.4634,1.4132,2.1674,1.5849,1.7101,2.0731,5.0067,4.0599,1.3731,3.3362,3.4227,1.5838,1.9483,0.8501,5.4759,0.0004,4.0906,0.5578,6.0522,0.4803,1.9954,1.6096,5.1949,4.4342,3.1126,1.3372,5.2631,1.5638,3.5821,4.8492,1.1043,2.4964,6.7633,2.7466,0.4888,4.1452,3.4266,4.6259,2.9517,2.3635,0.3563,0.285,1.5076,0.0004,3.9071,2.8357,5.4606,4.0563,0.5724,0.8586,2.4296,0.3561,3.683,2.206,0.5588,0.7327,5.5266,5.2647,0.8345,3.319,0.0003,0.8615,2.0657,5.8174,5.0034,3.5962,1.9347,1.9912,5.8957,0.478,3.3288,5.4466,1.7927,1.3965,1.2657,5.7123,3.9763,3.2744,0.5373,0.7727,4.3359,0.3707,2.4447,0.7623,1.7783,0.8489,0.0005,5.5514,2.4518,3.3381,5.1346,0.5543,2.0695,6.1537,0.8431,3.1789,5.6458,3.6829,5.5959,0.1677,3.5142,5.8934,4.8786,4.1585,4.4598,3.3418,0.1183,0.5733,0.8857,5.7397,1.9979,1.9905,3.7277,0.2981,1.3821,0.7277,1.5326,0.1782,0.4392,2.8786,5.9081,0.0796,0.0014,6.6287,2.2991,3.2954,0.0851,2.8277,1.8584,4.9473,5.2704,0.1945,0.0567,1.2646,3.5748,3.7221,4.9265,6.6749,0.4209,0.2601,0.6433,5.9251,3.0342,3.18,1.8224,0.0032,2.9893,1.9264,0.5402,4.5461,0.8663,0.8237,2.3235,1.8446,2.8875,4.3321,0.1585,2.5074,0.1772,2.6397,5.2352,0.6409,0.8553,2.089,0.7095,1.9282,0.3948,2.6428,1.3455,0.391,2.9032,0.2892,0.3211,5.4212,1.4251,2.9121,0.1368,1.3611,0.0004,4.2836,2.4937,2.7983,2.2081,4.7211,0.3952,0.7129,3.6569,3.0648,2.7615,0.1616,0.9177,4.1493,1.4012,2.8741,0.0002,4.8622,2.6011,6.0271,2.8909,7.5312,4.3517,1.7458,2.0155,1.9923,2.238,3.3948,0.4245,0.5326,2.023,3.1315,4.3285,3.1153,1.7885,4.3572,1.3748,2.0598,0.7677,0.7298,1.2339,1.1982,0.2577,1.5955,0.7574,5.5818,0.7835,1.5199,0.0002,2.2701,2.7482,2.041,5.6362,1.5615,7.1198,0.1203,1.8418,5.62,3.4743,1.5144,2.3277,4.4928,0.2434,1.0072,7.4459,2.8593,6.0616,2.1628,6.1429,2.3685,0.2425,0.0003,3.8438,4.0155,3.0277,6.0979,2.5092,5.7381,0.1964,3.223,4.1195,3.3758,4.3553,4.9249,0.4546,5.8864,1.5297,0.0003,3.2259,6.1364,1.5644,1.859,2.5802,0.6976,4.8369,0.2365,0.5437,1.089,0.8871,2.2834,3.8213,0.9464,2.8991,3.0401,3.6263,5.1587,3.2462,0.2789,3.336,4.9154,5.9311,5.1674,0.4633,1.2016,5.4738,1.5161,3.0741,0.1718,0.9754,0.8672,0.6594,0.0002,5.3258,2.9273,1.0445,2.0734,2.9945,2.4474,0.6764,2.4794,3.4794,1.362,2.1698,3.4808,1.6285,3.9217,0.0377,5.392,3.3356,4.0354,3.5048,0.0273,0.723,1.7328,1.6305,3.5985,4.6937,5.3484,4.7797,2.6907,4.6258,2.8463,3.4586,1.1927,2.2592,3.6616,0.4579,1.384,3.4342,3.3022,0.4337,2.7291,2.1006,3.0776,0.4223,0.0188,0.1956,2.6028,3.4814,0.0003,5.1872,3.7936,2.525,0.3293,4.1327,2.5987,2.2509,3.2776,0.9531,0.0002,3.3145,2.1049,4.5538,3.2701,1.9685,0.2926,1.0307,1.0742,0.1836,0.1303,0.823,0.0002,2.6189,4.5754,4.6446,3.1446,2.2939,4.2308,1.3597,6.4177,2.8466,1.8063,3.2907,3.0096,3.3837,1.9737,5.7021,1.251,3.7413,5.0305,0.8078,2.9429,5.9567,1.8482,4.625,5.6297,1.491,0.1968,0.6895,0.0002,5.7965,2.1874,2.7708,1.2773,2.1826,3.387,0.0931,4.5996,1.7607,3.1273,5.321,1.7957,3.77,5.0674,2.1393,3.9786,2.1077,4.304,3.6479,4.1124,2.9337,0.2335,0.6675,1.0648,0.0003,1.8079,4.735,3.4628,1.5905,2.479,2.5309,2.2779,1.4559,1.3847,5.5739,0.6941,5.5089,4.4276,2.4359,3.984,4.3359,3.5338,2.7273,2.174,0.0003,0.3593,9.4368,4.6457,2.5607,0.8748,1.3178,2.7919,2.0772,0.624,0.7166,1.8593,1.9885,0.4662,0.0003,2.8048,5.8036,3.7071,4.4141,4.0505,1.1468,2.1555,2.6486,2.2021,4.6972,1.0173,3.3436,5.7008,1.8884,2.2183,0.0754,0.2197,2.1651,5.5174,1.24,0.0192,6.1521,3.1339,0.412,3.8119,2.9632,2.7368,0.4035,2.4138,1.0942,4.5548,6.2566,2.8469,1.3778,4.1132,4.9652,0.8469,5.7856,1.2734,0.9916,2.7859,1.9932,3.4872,1.9531,1.3382,2.2613,0.8014,0.5801,4.385,4.278,3.9662,0.7127,0.1569,1.229,0.0002,3.9195,0.6411,5.3578,6.352,2.0832,4.7782,0.7842,2.1427,0.3821,2.1576,3.595,5.3569,1.5535,0.8844,0.4291,2.4291,3.9119,0.756,5.2064,2.1509,0.8204,2.0634,5.7905,0.8861,0.8177,1.863,0.633,0.0111,2.6547,4.6705,5.466,1.7498,1.3579,5.654,5.8291,0.7524,3.8306,2.7338,1.6284,2.8242,0.0026,2.1908,1.6525,1.1463]}
{"id":720,"ended":true,"length":556,"gen_text":"You are sent back in time to the year 1909 to kill a man who will invent a virus that renders the human race infertile. All you know is that he's a Jewish boy living in Europe. You name is Adolf Hitler. You are sent back in time to the year 1889 to kill a man who will turn his own people into animals. All you know is that he is the founder of the totalitarian states. All you know is that he is the father of 'Hitler's Children'. All you know is that he is the son of a 'Nazi' and that he is responsible for 'Hitler's Great Terror', 'Hitler's New Family', 'Hitler's Nazi', Hitler's Third World 'Great Terror', Hitler's Secret Crusade 'Great Great Terror', Nazi Germany. A man's brain is yours to choose from.\n\nNow a scientist named Ludwig Bornstein created the first atom bomb in 1957, with the help of a group of Jews, who called themselves the Third Reich. The group consisted of about 40 people, including the head of the Berlin concentration camp who was called 'Hitler the Nazi'.\n\nThey made a point of not using any nuclear missiles and simply having their brains destroyed as they found out who was responsible for the whole thing.\n\nIn 1964 they made a bomb called the Atomic Bomb, one of the most powerful bombs ever created for public safety. It was so powerful that it went off without warning.\n\nLater in the year, they made the atomic bomb known as the Atomic Bomb. It was a simple explosion with a diameter of two meters. As the atomic bomb dropped it was considered a miracle to have killed only three men and that would make the whole world happy if it did, then and now.\n\nIn 1976, they finally decided to start mass slaughter of Jews. After the war a man named Joseph Goebbels was sentenced to death for doing so. Hitler eventually moved to England.\n\nAll this occurred decades after the fact, because everyone knew that Hitler was the Jewish leader anyway. There was nobody who would admit this. And it took decades for them to know that he was an evil person. So Hitler, through his lawyers, had to go through a trial of lawyers and doctors and explain that it was a perfectly legitimate law that they needed to kill Jews, not be afraid of them. And his lawyers did the heavy lifting, and kept his lawyer for another 2 years. Then a new trial took place after that \u2013 and the only person who died from the first bomb was Joseph Goebbels.\n, Hitler actually gave away some of his brain for free in 1979. After that the story was almost forgotten until it was finally covered up after the U.S. government gave it away for free.\n\nI really believe this story is all fabricated and we should all take it as a lie and stop calling it fake.","token_len":589,"entropy":[3.8828,8.1972,3.9029,3.0505,0.4957,1.3664,1.5979,4.4656,7.234,3.045,5.8313,2.5878,3.0358,1.787,5.2035,10.618,1.1362,6.755,1.5586,7.4522,2.4663,2.0883,1.0166,5.9695,0.046,0.0002,0.6996,4.9394,2.4211,5.2338,0.3334,0.3846,2.5143,2.6463,1.559,6.2782,4.0888,4.6102,0.3871,5.0179,1.2771,2.3969,8.1128,9.0272,5.1329,0.0605,0.6993,1.8232,1.8508,0.3664,0.1939,0.366,0.014,0.1202,0.3447,0.1487,5.1912,0.1662,0.4772,0.5153,0.5059,0.161,0.1491,5.176,3.6483,3.8033,2.4718,0.5359,4.5738,0.8606,0.8287,0.0986,0.0562,0.0552,0.0482,0.2974,1.9323,3.2565,3.45,0.0744,0.9579,5.893,5.2281,1.6782,1.0996,0.0995,0.2556,0.113,0.0607,0.3723,0.896,0.682,3.3907,0.0684,6.937,3.0102,0.003,1.6288,1.7415,1.2379,0.6598,0.0387,0.1658,0.09,0.0474,0.3051,0.5947,0.3706,3.6346,0.0425,1.8111,5.2413,2.5462,1.1361,1.827,1.3623,0.7077,0.866,3.5764,0.043,3.7912,3.3477,0.0064,0.0603,4.8185,0.7347,3.6354,2.1342,0.5096,0.0029,0.0607,5.0309,5.8414,1.2571,0.8794,0.0577,0.0013,0.0343,4.4146,4.7158,3.1486,0.0885,4.2933,3.9302,4.3993,2.782,0.9949,0.5319,1.4291,0.0344,5.2498,5.6751,5.5102,2.8098,5.8923,0.4041,0.3712,3.3287,1.617,4.3172,6.277,2.1651,3.827,5.3414,0.7863,5.8994,1.1119,3.8754,0.5515,0.6043,1.9861,0.0548,4.2817,5.6269,5.5136,2.6988,5.1549,5.979,0.6907,5.0453,1.7073,1.8954,4.6144,0.108,1.6388,4.3865,1.918,4.2319,0.9805,1.4069,0.008,1.6687,2.4359,0.0365,5.2971,2.3884,1.6967,4.0729,0.1867,0.4666,5.7125,0.0429,0.8393,2.0592,4.2418,4.0681,0.041,4.0669,3.2366,2.016,0.9595,1.4316,2.3515,2.6151,0.0675,0.2455,4.6678,5.4141,0.1703,3.1547,1.2622,4.7819,2.3954,1.4764,0.0117,4.2912,3.2311,0.7818,2.3525,0.0002,3.8147,4.0305,1.5864,5.1008,0.2076,3.3928,2.9288,2.4363,3.0409,6.8427,3.1191,4.6204,5.0374,3.114,3.3733,2.3283,4.3772,1.6629,4.855,1.5423,4.2687,1.3557,0.5705,0.3807,0.9169,4.5164,0.7729,0.185,1.2629,0.0002,3.0026,4.764,3.3372,3.3837,0.842,3.468,1.7413,0.5625,3.2998,1.2585,1.5346,6.15,0.7646,0.4033,1.4703,0.7001,2.1646,0.5028,2.9212,5.0866,6.0734,2.6742,0.4496,1.3604,0.7784,3.6758,0.1397,0.4405,1.141,4.4565,1.1286,2.7754,0.5876,1.282,1.1853,0.0001,5.5905,2.0698,1.0679,0.9671,1.1627,1.9467,1.3886,1.9413,3.2948,0.1876,1.6966,0.7879,0.3641,2.9581,1.2801,2.3692,1.3238,0.5014,2.3086,4.9028,5.6283,2.5963,1.3462,4.6611,0.0798,4.6248,2.3095,0.979,5.6672,1.538,3.7777,0.2883,5.0134,2.0622,2.1185,5.5468,1.5163,3.6899,2.876,1.5676,3.8532,3.4185,3.7318,3.2391,2.6865,3.5554,3.6664,3.1329,2.4958,2.1845,1.126,3.6532,5.2665,1.107,1.455,3.2966,6.0693,4.9321,0.3166,0.2577,0.3059,0.0002,2.2115,4.39,0.7121,1.8356,5.1747,4.203,0.3036,4.0802,3.6501,5.1268,2.713,1.9208,1.2643,4.4278,2.5167,2.7049,4.4639,3.8282,0.1834,3.7251,1.5635,0.0005,0.0023,0.0,2.0509,4.3007,0.0456,0.5482,0.694,4.2678,1.6819,0.3916,4.197,5.2501,5.522,0.9065,3.0708,2.7147,0.9418,0.0001,5.1352,1.839,4.3748,6.2757,0.9409,0.7854,4.0598,1.4019,4.1063,5.9567,1.1577,0.9178,1.5202,0.7515,2.2189,5.9322,2.2938,6.6012,0.4181,4.6095,0.7522,4.5509,1.771,2.7995,3.1106,2.4829,1.4048,4.1859,2.9373,3.8439,3.7513,1.2865,3.7709,0.061,4.8473,1.0029,2.2169,0.1875,3.9343,2.2622,3.145,0.8832,4.0573,3.8635,3.8579,4.7653,0.7468,5.6416,0.5578,3.7601,1.4108,2.8076,1.6179,1.533,2.2489,3.6493,5.3004,1.6116,3.0506,1.7885,5.5651,1.6982,3.3819,0.3104,2.3652,5.4168,2.0479,4.13,2.1339,4.0705,3.8682,0.1876,2.2626,2.6207,2.5937,1.8387,4.9907,4.142,0.7952,1.7519,0.6034,3.0474,5.435,0.9609,3.0173,3.2096,5.5363,0.0198,1.8691,2.2451,5.4861,3.3844,4.5068,4.0698,4.9579,4.6492,0.7234,0.698,3.604,4.351,3.7099,1.138,2.0678,0.016,5.2911,0.8015,5.8859,2.0833,2.2621,4.0652,2.7369,0.706,5.7005,2.9681,1.0083,4.8368,4.2599,0.3358,3.1397,0.0703,0.0016,0.0026,0.001,0.4593,0.4407,10.7824,3.3983,6.3692,4.5765,4.4842,3.7669,0.5613,0.2517,3.6469,2.9863,0.7981,2.4109,4.8169,0.7191,4.5456,0.9578,2.5986,4.1992,2.174,4.4255,1.2341,3.948,2.8087,0.6659,2.17,3.3466,0.6937,5.5845,1.2358,5.303,0.0313,0.0953,0.0216,1.0021,4.5077,1.7423,0.6433,2.5741,0.5434,0.7915,0.6591,0.0002,4.3754,4.815,3.0325,2.9333,1.5024,1.0828,4.0155,4.79,2.5321,4.7943,2.0451,1.1258,3.0655,1.9832,2.4126,1.3466,4.806,2.6638,2.9405,4.4606,0.4107,5.2087,0.5678]}
{"id":1514,"ended":true,"length":556,"gen_text":"You die and find yourself in Valhalla, where all great warriors go when they die. However, you never fought a day in your life. You try to find out why you're there. You never go to sleep in the night.\n\n\nIt's better to be alive today because of the sacrifice of all things. It should never be to you for that to happen.\n\n\n\"The time comes when you have to take responsibility for your future life.\n\n\n\"You feel trapped inside of the heart of this people, and you fight like it's your job to save them.\"\n\n\nWe're all victims of our environment. The problem of air pollution has devastated people who were exposed to it. While we're on the subject of air pollution, the Environmental Protection Agency acknowledges the fact that we are under one of the highest environmental damage factors found in the world with over 100,000 people living in US cities. The EPA also estimates that air pollution causes serious health problems, including asthma, lung disease, cardiovascular disease, infertility and more.\n\n\nBut the EPA's goal is to keep you out of the world.\n\n\nThey've learned the difference in how you feel and when you feel. You should not feel angry, angry, angry. You should not feel disappointed.\n\n\n\"I'm living my old life, even after I'm diagnosed with cancer which will set you right.\"\n\n\nI think I love the thought of my children living an incredible life!\n\n\nThe health of the Earth is very important to us. It makes us so proud, even more so as they find meaning in life that they will never have.\n\n\nEvery year, we're reminded of our role as a society in caring for, and understanding each other. We're not concerned, so to live in this world we live in is the responsibility of the Earth as a whole. We don't simply put up with bad air and we don't let our emotions dictate how we live our lives.\n\n\nThe environment will not change what you consider good, so it should be treated as good when you are free from this polluted world.\n\n\nLet us live in the spirit of God, because not all will look at God's way when the day comes.\n\n\n\"What if I die in my sleep? Let me stay dead, not be afraid.\n\n\n\" The day you die, your life will be over.\"\n\n\nThe problem that has become of the world's poor is our problem of air pollution. The Air Pollution Law says that pollution can only be eliminated by addressing certain issues. For some, breathing air is not a health problem, it's a personal or societal problem.\n\n\nThere are good charities and programs that can help you overcome our pollution problem. We hope that a few of the listed charities will be able to provide an atmosphere that will promote compassion and love in the face of this pollution.","token_len":589,"entropy":[8.7887,3.2812,5.3725,2.9594,1.5082,7.1049,1.4558,2.6251,3.6185,7.7464,5.3357,5.163,5.1204,0.7518,1.7157,1.0405,5.6357,0.1081,2.1908,3.5623,9.8807,2.1658,5.1809,1.9965,0.7932,0.116,1.5175,1.3637,6.5621,0.3954,3.1319,2.6352,2.4634,1.4132,2.1674,1.5849,1.7101,2.0731,5.0067,4.0599,1.3731,3.3362,3.4227,1.5838,1.9483,0.8501,5.4759,0.0004,4.0906,0.5578,6.0522,0.4803,1.9954,1.6096,5.1949,4.4342,3.1126,1.3372,5.2631,1.5638,3.5821,4.8492,1.1043,2.4964,6.7633,2.7466,0.4888,4.1452,3.4266,4.6259,2.9517,2.3635,0.3563,0.285,1.5076,0.0004,3.9071,2.8357,5.4606,4.0563,0.5724,0.8586,2.4296,0.3561,3.683,2.206,0.5588,0.7327,5.5266,5.2647,0.8345,3.319,0.0003,0.8615,2.0657,5.8174,5.0034,3.5962,1.9347,1.9912,5.8957,0.478,3.3288,5.4466,1.7927,1.3965,1.2657,5.7123,3.9763,3.2744,0.5373,0.7727,4.3359,0.3707,2.4447,0.7623,1.7783,0.8489,0.0005,5.5514,2.4518,3.3381,5.1346,0.5543,2.0695,6.1537,0.8431,3.1789,5.6458,3.6829,5.5959,0.1677,3.5142,5.8934,4.8786,4.1585,4.4598,3.3418,0.1183,0.5733,0.8857,5.7397,1.9979,1.9905,3.7277,0.2981,1.3821,0.7277,1.5326,0.1782,0.4392,2.8786,5.9081,0.0796,0.0014,6.6287,2.2991,3.2954,0.0851,2.8277,1.8584,4.9473,5.2704,0.1945,0.0567,1.2646,3.5748,3.7221,4.9265,6.6749,0.4209,0.2601,0.6433,5.9251,3.0342,3.18,1.8224,0.0032,2.9893,1.9264,0.5402,4.5461,0.8663,0.8237,2.3235,1.8446,2.8875,4.3321,0.1585,2.5074,0.1772,2.6397,5.2352,0.6409,0.8553,2.089,0.7095,1.9282,0.3948,2.6428,1.3455,0.391,2.9032,0.2892,0.3211,5.4212,1.4251,2.9121,0.1368,1.3611,0.0004,4.2836,2.4937,2.7983,2.2081,4.7211,0.3952,0.7129,3.6569,3.0648,2.7615,0.1616,0.9177,4.1493,1.4012,2.8741,0.0002,4.8622,2.6011,6.0271,2.8909,7.5312,4.3517,1.7458,2.0155,1.9923,2.238,3.3948,0.4245,0.5326,2.023,3.1315,4.3285,3.1153,1.7885,4.3572,1.3748,2.0598,0.7677,0.7298,1.2339,1.1982,0.2577,1.5955,0.7574,5.5818,0.7835,1.5199,0.0002,2.2701,2.7482,2.041,5.6362,1.5615,7.1198,0.1203,1.8418,5.62,3.4743,1.5144,2.3277,4.4928,0.2434,1.0072,7.4459,2.8593,6.0616,2.1628,6.1429,2.3685,0.2425,0.0003,3.8438,4.0155,3.0277,6.0979,2.5092,5.7381,0.1964,3.223,4.1195,3.3758,4.3553,4.9249,0.4546,5.8864,1.5297,0.0003,3.2259,6.1364,1.5644,1.859,2.5802,0.6976,4.8369,0.2365,0.5437,1.089,0.8871,2.2834,3.8213,0.9464,2.8991,3.0401,3.6263,5.1587,3.2462,0.2789,3.336,4.9154,5.9311,5.1674,0.4633,1.2016,5.4738,1.5161,3.0741,0.1718,0.9754,0.8672,0.6594,0.0002,5.3258,2.9273,1.0445,2.0734,2.9945,2.4474,0.6764,2.4794,3.4794,1.362,2.1698,3.4808,1.6285,3.9217,0.0377,5.392,3.3356,4.0354,3.5048,0.0273,0.723,1.7328,1.6305,3.5985,4.6937,5.3484,4.7797,2.6907,4.6258,2.8463,3.4586,1.1927,2.2592,3.6616,0.4579,1.384,3.4342,3.3022,0.4337,2.7291,2.1006,3.0776,0.4223,0.0188,0.1956,2.6028,3.4814,0.0003,5.1872,3.7936,2.525,0.3293,4.1327,2.5987,2.2509,3.2776,0.9531,0.0002,3.3145,2.1049,4.5538,3.2701,1.9685,0.2926,1.0307,1.0742,0.1836,0.1303,0.823,0.0002,2.6189,4.5754,4.6446,3.1446,2.2939,4.2308,1.3597,6.4177,2.8466,1.8063,3.2907,3.0096,3.3837,1.9737,5.7021,1.251,3.7413,5.0305,0.8078,2.9429,5.9567,1.8482,4.625,5.6297,1.491,0.1968,0.6895,0.0002,5.7965,2.1874,2.7708,1.2773,2.1826,3.387,0.0931,4.5996,1.7607,3.1273,5.321,1.7957,3.77,5.0674,2.1393,3.9786,2.1077,4.304,3.6479,4.1124,2.9337,0.2335,0.6675,1.0648,0.0003,1.8079,4.735,3.4628,1.5905,2.479,2.5309,2.2779,1.4559,1.3847,5.5739,0.6941,5.5089,4.4276,2.4359,3.984,4.3359,3.5338,2.7273,2.174,0.0003,0.3593,9.4368,4.6457,2.5607,0.8748,1.3178,2.7919,2.0772,0.624,0.7166,1.8593,1.9885,0.4662,0.0003,2.8048,5.8036,3.7071,4.4141,4.0505,1.1468,2.1555,2.6486,2.2021,4.6972,1.0173,3.3436,5.7008,1.8884,2.2183,0.0754,0.2197,2.1651,5.5174,1.24,0.0192,6.1521,3.1339,0.412,3.8119,2.9632,2.7368,0.4035,2.4138,1.0942,4.5548,6.2566,2.8469,1.3778,4.1132,4.9652,0.8469,5.7856,1.2734,0.9916,2.7859,1.9932,3.4872,1.9531,1.3382,2.2613,0.8014,0.5801,4.385,4.278,3.9662,0.7127,0.1569,1.229,0.0002,3.9195,0.6411,5.3578,6.352,2.0832,4.7782,0.7842,2.1427,0.3821,2.1576,3.595,5.3569,1.5535,0.8844,0.4291,2.4291,3.9119,0.756,5.2064,2.1509,0.8204,2.0634,5.7905,0.8861,0.8177,1.863,0.633,0.0111,2.6547,4.6705,5.466,1.7498,1.3579,5.654,5.8291,0.7524,3.8306,2.7338,1.6284,2.8242,0.0026,2.1908,1.6525,1.1463]}

Most of the time that it's always just for you.\n\nSo, I think that there's much more to this.","token_len":590,"entropy":[5.5189,4.1121,4.3052,1.7918,5.5469,0.2275,6.777,1.3346,1.7688,6.619,1.2895,6.0899,1.6041,3.4044,0.0401,1.8362,6.2266,0.6533,5.235,1.0386,1.1309,1.8496,4.1101,11.0272,5.1226,7.0445,0.7952,0.7097,13.5693,11.3515,10.8833,10.4484,2.3235,0.3553,2.0083,9.0971,7.1342,13.4479,10.1957,2.6607,1.2178,5.429,1.5833,2.9729,3.1999,6.5061,0.0083,5.7665,0.8695,6.3515,0.0075,2.2133,0.3537,5.2137,4.6877,1.2399,4.1859,0.2769,0.76,0.1862,1.1828,3.5159,4.7443,0.6137,1.1357,3.5761,5.4262,4.4928,5.1002,1.7052,5.1345,1.0673,2.4283,0.6943,0.7636,0.0002,5.7031,2.3692,6.1184,1.7664,0.9884,0.0002,2.9325,3.1723,2.2435,0.3219,0.2046,0.128,1.05,2.4077,4.694,2.6468,0.5417,1.5057,0.0002,2.6776,0.9535,0.0149,0.2108,1.8858,0.5666,2.82,3.6379,3.2491,1.0795,0.0006,0.1275,0.1672,2.8634,0.0028,6.172,1.3328,0.2175,3.1815,0.6027,0.0572,0.0307,0.0079,9.1535,0.9578,2.236,2.7551,5.8852,5.9127,5.2309,3.2647,0.0017,0.2194,0.0042,1.2139,0.0089,0.2346,2.1957,1.6007,0.1266,1.3661,0.0279,5.1515,0.0008,0.1001,0.7416,0.3979,0.7495,6.0799,1.3406,0.6051,0.5369,4.9106,0.3006,1.1066,2.0288,3.581,0.3025,1.2374,0.4987,0.5164,0.2919,0.0001,5.0467,1.366,1.4081,0.2173,1.1882,2.0144,5.6773,0.1447,0.0001,4.0589,0.748,0.1023,1.1916,0.0099,0.3151,0.1113,0.002,2.6861,0.0005,5.8549,4.6619,5.7174,3.9547,3.616,0.2683,0.5947,0.1068,4.607,0.0501,4.6218,0.2368,1.0585,2.5488,1.1022,1.0724,0.0007,0.3924,0.0039,0.0017,0.0001,0.0004,0.0016,0.0242,0.001,0.5284,0.0017,3.6625,0.0573,0.2221,2.7433,5.2576,0.4157,0.4542,0.9186,0.9813,0.1115,2.4408,0.1117,0.1233,4.6349,4.2058,1.73,1.2944,1.1104,3.9741,0.0498,0.4777,0.2739,4.4119,0.7336,5.6536,0.4435,1.5387,0.6522,0.3718,1.7788,0.8508,2.9057,0.0522,6.586,0.4233,0.11,0.0128,0.0146,0.3333,0.0056,0.1703,0.021,0.0322,3.0041,2.9885,4.2838,0.1861,2.955,3.2055,2.0272,0.2686,0.1956,2.441,0.5407,0.4818,2.3926,5.5651,0.0007,3.4807,1.8967,2.0473,1.7123,0.0831,2.6875,0.6424,0.1295,1.1376,0.1801,0.3119,3.3493,0.0133,1.1251,0.1578,2.3078,0.1199,0.0885,4.8425,1.6337,3.5923,5.9023,1.2593,0.3088,3.6174,1.0614,0.1586,6.6657,0.1024,0.2468,0.0027,0.0049,0.0122,0.0046,2.0004,0.0185,1.8664,0.0468,0.0002,0.0015,0.0256,0.1005,0.1011,0.7011,4.7891,4.1264,5.9837,5.2948,3.0625,1.3891,3.4501,1.1465,0.2854,0.102,0.8344,2.6402,0.1061,2.9826,0.0152,0.1288,0.0032,0.1819,0.2994,2.6305,1.321,0.1117,5.3208,0.2653,0.0237,5.4823,1.0137,0.2693,4.8723,1.7097,0.9569,1.862,0.029,0.1228,0.098,2.0593,0.1929,0.2406,0.8517,0.0017,0.042,0.0028,1.8016,1.0851,2.8658,0.9892,0.1864,0.1772,0.8389,0.0317,0.0248,2.0154,0.086,0.0393,0.0521,0.1415,0.1234,1.3731,0.0401,0.0694,0.0783,3.5417,0.1649,0.0251,2.4892,5.9141,1.5337,6.0066,4.4732,2.2552,2.2601,0.9434,0.2451,0.0001,5.2369,4.7127,4.7412,0.8019,0.4541,0.0002,3.9641,0.9394,1.4974,2.0483,2.9247,0.1221,0.0001,2.5027,0.8552,0.0719,0.3274,5.3849,0.0481,0.0697,5.9912,0.9397,0.6727,1.653,0.0022,0.0137,0.0117,0.1698,0.3762,0.5534,0.1656,0.0959,0.5355,0.0234,0.0078,5.918,4.611,0.3801,0.4438,0.3644,0.4892,0.0001,5.0029,2.7112,1.8025,2.9178,1.4647,0.0211,0.0001,6.0588,3.5557,2.2942,1.8359,0.6891,0.0002,3.2196,5.0175,2.2064,3.8398,5.4224,0.6522,5.4897,5.3657,5.1864,1.8132,4.0212,1.6975,3.2573,1.8162,4.5666,0.4207,1.2189,0.9729,0.0001,3.5415,3.3515,4.3671,1.0031,0.0455,0.0002,1.2144,0.6262,0.0732,5.3327,1.7439,2.5717,0.2964,0.4034,1.5203,0.1192,0.0066,0.0022,0.2844,5.2156,0.4993,0.0556,0.0449,0.4348,0.8504,0.0276,0.0024,2.9566,0.0019,0.1951,0.7077,4.1117,0.0131,3.3271,0.2601,0.0039,2.303,0.0262,3.4064,1.4979,0.3899,0.8267,0.1359,0.0539,0.1139,0.0212,0.0035,2.1874,0.1251,0.0812,0.074,1.6162,0.0621,0.8087,7.0738,4.5833,3.1262,2.2961,1.0644,1.4705,2.937,3.5325,0.795,0.0002,4.044,0.2718,3.1467,3.815,0.0529,6.4758,4.5312,2.7978,2.2445,3.7551,0.8137,0.0001,3.0055,0.213,0.1018,0.3198,1.5474,0.1244,0.005,0.7961,0.0009,0.0159,0.0072,0.2467,0.0998,0.0941,0.0329,0.0205,0.0343,0.0013,0.0017,2.2581,0.2698,0.0131,0.0905,0.0442,1.7984,0.0001,5.08,3.4619,4.4852,0.8444,1.7214,4.9802,1.4766,6.2098,1.0208,0.3826,0.217,3.3497,3.8044,1.9525,5.523,4.0173,4.1022,2.816,0.687,1.0543,0.0003,5.3116,1.5731,2.4539,3.2991,2.3607,4.0162,1.2777,5.1154,0.7187,0.5437,1.6803,2.3377]}
{"id":2077,"ended":false,"length":575,"gen_text":"Reality TV has been taken to the next level. Now people follow you with cameras all the time. You never know if that means something is really happening or if it's just something you can't see. In short: Reality TV is real and we want you to see that.\n\nIt's hard to put into words what it is. Reality has become our personal favorite medium. Now we live inside of it.\n\nIt is a very personal medium. It is so human that if we could only feel the emotion that people are expressing. The emotion of fear. When you feel fear. You look at your friends, because they were talking about it. You go, \"Oh, they're scared. If you do this, we will know what to do.\"\n\nA good word to describe it is love. Love is hardwired in us. There are really no simple guidelines that help you build what we call Love, and there are so many other ways to experience it.\n\nHow do you develop Love through the experience? This might be the difference in how you interpret and appreciate the experience. You might have a hard time focusing on what's really important to you when you are very young. But when you've grown up through the experience, your feelings, which will change as you change. Your emotions will start to change.\n\nNow we all fall in love, and we need to make those changes on our own. But it doesn't matter whether or not that's true. As long as you stay motivated. What matters is you and will make sure your journey is well made. If you don't get the message then you can't go on with your life, so stay motivated and take part in it. You want to do your part and have the right person in your life, and that person is the one who can deliver.\n\nIf we make the time so many different things happen together over a short period of time, that makes this one day happen with no one saying bad things about you.\n\nWhen people meet people in real life that want help, not just some bad one, they meet something that gives them the support they need and they make sure they are doing something about it. We're not going to allow that one night to happen. We're only going to give them that support. We can make sure they make the effort. We can make sure they feel really comfortable with themselves over time.

{"id":577,"ended":true,"length":566,"gen_text":"One morning, you wake up and suddenly find yourself three years in the past, as if the last three years had never happened. It happened to the entire world and everyone remembers.\n\nHowever, that is exactly what happened.\n\nYou can see how it can happen in other scenarios. For example, let us say we want to keep track of how many time periods we have taken, but there are hundreds of years between us and our past. In this scenario, we have taken more than 1000 days away, and each day is less than 3 days. Imagine if we could take a moment to remember this, and have we spent 9 years with us, with more than 3 years, and have we never left home for any reason? Imagine that our children will remember the fact that we took our time away because we were tired and tired, and that they would be happy to learn about us from our friends and family members. In other words, when your parents go away and you are not working late on school, there is no work at all.\n\nYou have seen things like that previously, but it is time to let go yourself. Remember this, let us. Think about it for a moment.\n\nYou know what time it is?\n\nNow you can see how it can happen in many other circumstances.\n\nIn this example, we set a time limit of 100 days, but we do not go further than 15 days. If we don't go further, we lose my life.\n\nWhy Not Take Time Away?, If You Give Us Time, Even That Long Time.\n\nHere is one more thing that makes it harder to go farther. If we give you time, even 15 days, the time limit will become permanent, so your life will end tomorrow.\n\nNow, you can see how it can happen in many other circumstances. For example, if we do not go further than 1 day, then we will never go on vacation, because we will not be able to finish our job. Our home will become one big house after all, and this is just what we will have to do.\n\nIf You Give Us Time.\n\nIf you give us something, even less time than you give us, make sure you give us something that even small you can feel, and allow us to feel it. If you give us anything smaller than 1 day, just remember that that day, if you want to move on with your life now, let us go over this later.\n\nWhen you feel that feeling, consider this. If you keep doing it for 15 days, your life will end tomorrow, and you will start to see that there are really things we cannot do, to do our better selves.\n\nI hope it makes you feel all right. Keep doing your best self self self.

{"id":3,"ended":false,"length":549,"gen_text":"For years in your youth the same imaginary character appears in your dreams, you are good friends. Years later, when adult, you meet her in real life, she clearly recognises you and tries to avoid you, and you want answers.\n\nHowever, in your current life, she is acting like the other person, like a person she was before, like a person she knew.\n\nSo you have to change your life a lot before you can change your real life.\n\nStep four, you have to figure out and change the lives of all other people, and that's what I'm going to do:\n\nStep three, you have to do some writing, so that you have the perfect answer\n\nStep one, you have to write down your answer for each person, to the person with your perfect answer :\n\nStep TWO, your answer says,.\n\nStep ONE, your answer says,. You keep typing like some idiot but it's easy to follow :\n\nStep TWO, your answer says,.\n\nStep ONE, your answer says,. You keep typing.\n\nand so on\n\nAnd so on.\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nYes, I get it. You should have already set a few goals for yourself so that you can start writing your very own answers.\n\nStep three, instead of writing some answers, write some good answers.. right?\n\nI think I will do that, but I want to make the best of your life so I am going to create answers of my own (you must start with a little more then just writing this one : ) that you will enjoy reading :)\n\nNow, if your question is about your dreams, you are not going to have dreams. That would not mean that dreams you have never encountered exist in this world but that they must be written a little more then in this world.\n\nWhat I have done is:\n\nI took the best ideas from my own writing and then gave them to the ones I found I could write for each person. There are three ways to write these ideas:\n\nFirst, start writing for yourself, using words in your everyday writing, like what I said above.\n\nSecondly, create the solution you want for your dream (to make sure you have the right answer for everyone you meet). For instance, my dream is to grow up and be one of the first students in my school and I think that being on the world's top 10 most intelligent students is really going to make sure I can grow up like she has.\n\nThirdly, put in some positive thinking work for this dream to be complete. I usually have these things written down in my notes that are really helpful so that I can understand how our society views the world around us.\n\nThis is all very helpful to me.\n\nSo what do I need your help on?","token_len":591,"entropy":[6.5019,5.1704,6.8386,6.6244,4.8744,4.9787,11.4103,4.8222,5.3868,1.2356,1.2624,2.2692,1.5222,3.6874,2.9006,8.0884,3.7023,2.3023,6.7897,0.3917,1.0067,2.1665,10.9721,2.6919,0.4807,3.8312,4.2979,2.6569,5.1416,0.0106,1.2929,1.2244,7.9993,6.4782,0.0011,0.9439,2.1659,4.4498,0.0704,6.6006,1.4482,2.5328,3.0417,1.5809,5.3902,7.8746,0.7357,1.9006,0.017,4.6092,0.2126,2.766,1.5675,4.7302,1.4081,0.6452,2.2791,1.4892,5.8185,1.8562,3.5426,3.947,1.0948,1.3819,5.3727,1.615,3.8834,3.8723,3.3258,2.2931,1.9517,2.0136,1.0362,0.6024,1.1272,4.8356,2.1126,1.5983,0.0002,3.5769,1.9871,2.6411,1.2722,3.727,1.0883,3.0102,4.1827,1.5467,4.2492,0.5049,0.8616,2.3785,1.1487,3.2701,0.4304,0.4513,0.6522,0.0002,5.465,5.286,3.9488,2.5535,1.9154,0.1704,5.0761,0.0253,5.9821,2.2932,2.1315,6.271,0.1487,3.108,4.4012,0.3067,2.3001,1.8275,2.281,0.9519,1.6446,1.6196,1.7749,0.8541,0.0099,0.4377,4.755,0.7211,0.0001,1.7066,4.1306,0.295,0.7544,0.543,0.021,3.9793,3.1344,5.7541,1.6379,3.7226,0.9031,0.7461,3.3862,2.654,5.3525,5.7909,4.1715,0.0002,0.755,3.398,0.1886,0.5007,0.2453,0.0337,1.3555,3.5969,2.1225,3.4343,2.7863,2.2238,1.1879,1.4638,3.849,4.2493,2.9537,3.9308,3.3884,4.6268,0.1154,9.4254,1.2016,0.0002,0.5494,6.9811,0.1041,4.5209,1.2294,6.1985,13.1142,0.9017,0.0002,0.2833,1.0435,0.1853,1.6645,0.1695,0.0969,1.7085,3.7184,6.2598,5.2537,5.5112,6.6612,3.3795,5.0738,2.8337,1.2911,5.396,0.538,5.3884,3.7995,0.2177,0.0002,0.3034,1.0732,0.0442,0.6883,0.0502,0.0567,0.8915,0.636,0.0001,0.3234,0.9411,0.0488,0.1974,0.0117,0.0167,0.1413,0.9604,1.3566,0.6877,4.884,0.5691,0.0002,7.5008,3.1095,0.225,2.8223,0.0002,2.6329,1.1959,0.0874,1.3162,0.2886,0.0002,2.9609,3.7288,2.3666,1.0979,0.6187,0.3311,0.0002,5.7259,0.2862,1.8415,4.9226,0.6239,0.3373,2.9227,4.0417,2.8858,5.1889,5.6466,3.6416,4.3914,1.5823,1.6086,0.1855,4.1517,0.5475,0.3545,0.7735,3.7882,1.6932,2.5727,6.4538,0.7065,1.4456,0.9629,0.402,0.0002,2.1838,0.486,0.0945,6.3242,0.0282,1.3811,4.6266,3.0628,1.4078,2.305,1.3293,5.2052,2.468,7.5695,6.3958,1.384,0.3899,0.0002,3.2817,3.0829,2.4879,3.3484,2.681,0.9861,2.5555,1.9811,1.2914,3.4108,0.6063,2.7222,3.6576,3.1391,1.0235,4.0707,2.0204,3.2515,3.4394,3.5933,0.6085,0.0109,4.564,5.8486,5.2158,1.4096,0.0217,4.7694,3.4542,4.5499,4.1667,1.6199,2.5377,3.8005,3.0105,5.1996,3.0856,2.3541,4.2558,2.115,5.7787,4.0602,5.0472,1.1557,1.4959,3.404,2.1642,4.4839,0.252,0.0003,3.9411,1.0356,2.6676,4.1791,3.5128,0.794,2.8171,2.5156,4.2786,0.5742,1.5804,2.343,2.1412,1.6146,0.012,2.7252,4.3021,1.7756,4.1578,3.3179,3.4087,3.4031,0.8295,4.2975,5.9313,1.0298,2.7821,6.3123,3.8475,2.4257,3.8975,0.5659,5.1502,1.9063,1.6379,4.5588,0.8966,5.5122,6.0482,2.552,1.9226,1.6982,4.5089,1.9968,0.278,0.4947,0.2727,0.0002,4.2202,1.6892,3.8637,1.5103,0.389,3.4518,0.2207,0.0001,1.4565,4.8899,2.0046,4.5045,4.0204,0.8899,1.4428,1.9231,3.9027,1.1158,4.3589,4.0474,0.1369,0.3024,2.084,4.9399,1.1923,3.6112,5.3147,2.0569,1.5031,1.4777,4.7713,0.3829,0.905,5.6985,0.8726,3.995,2.9326,0.9515,1.6833,3.3359,3.999,1.4376,0.2467,0.0002,4.2547,0.6166,4.7405,2.1454,3.9704,1.3305,1.9183,4.4041,3.6858,3.7002,0.7741,3.5389,3.3281,1.9925,2.4024,4.9785,2.4261,2.5065,1.3517,0.8823,0.6382,0.0002,3.6975,0.0297,4.2361,3.5823,5.4646,1.6683,1.1249,1.9159,1.3613,1.8239,3.6334,5.0134,3.2968,3.0644,0.8916,1.7345,1.2739,1.2163,0.9284,1.172,3.9135,2.5303,0.6516,1.3775,4.1432,3.088,0.2611,4.6848,0.9275,0.8887,0.7748,5.9333,1.0631,2.0123,2.0387,5.303,0.265,0.2778,3.1339,6.4154,1.1937,1.2754,0.9599,2.9481,1.9849,4.0394,1.3142,5.3338,4.8886,1.0757,5.2328,1.1466,2.0073,3.6249,1.6501,4.4438,2.6011,1.2598,3.231,2.9788,0.0053,1.6849,6.4655,1.0698,2.3624,3.0089,0.629,4.5268,6.1635,2.7269,0.9593,0.3198,0.0002,0.534,0.0688,0.04,5.2033,2.4803,1.9713,5.2637,3.8046,6.3544,2.606,4.3109,0.9867,3.7813,3.0113,4.6441,0.8544,2.324,5.5342,2.7656,4.6344,2.7376,2.1261,1.3228,1.8112,0.3598,3.1358,4.0921,3.1083,3.9221,1.915,4.4231,0.4791,0.5995,0.2974,5.4155,2.1504,6.9489,3.5427,4.1186,2.8635,0.7124,3.6146,0.1017,0.5557,0.437,0.0002,3.7854,0.9879,3.7591,2.4034,2.4744,2.3624,1.0244,1.2879,0.9273,0.0002,2.5153,3.3026,1.5058,0.9908,2.5893,5.1973,0.1281,3.9374,0.6182]}
{"id":3044,"ended":false,"length":551,"gen_text":"Technology allows us to uplift dogs to human intelligence level. They are as amazing as expected. The dogs, however, are shocked to see how evil humans are.\n\nHowever, that are the true human level scientists, who can prove to them what they have already proven them. And I feel sorry for those that are actually being harmed in their work.\n\nThis could change once people realize that we are really capable of better understanding our environment so that we can make more humane decisions using only animal behavior based on common sense. We are human and human-focused, and so it makes sense to have humane opinions about our environment so that all people who can understand the differences and have a better understanding can act with compassion and good will toward a community. A human's humanity is our ability to love ourselves, to make a choice that is worth considering in the present and to believe what our future partners want us to believe.\n\nThis article from Forbes is a great reminder about humanity. As part of our research, we created an online database to track humanity, so you can see for yourself. We have included more animals than humans in this article as well. Here are some statistics for some of the more remarkable animals you can see in this article:\n\n\u00b7 Most humans eat a whole diet of insects\n\n\u00b7 Most humans eat only one meal (the whole meat only meal)\n\n\u00b7 Most humans eat one meal (the meat only meal)\n\n\u00b7 Most humans eat only one meal (the whole meat only meal)\n\n\u00b7 Most people eating one meal (the whole meat only meal)\n\n\u00b7 Most people eating one meal (the whole meat only meal)\n\n\u00b7 Most people eating one meal (the whole meat only meal)\n\n\u00b7 Most people eating one meal (the whole meat only meal)\n\n\u00b7 Most people eating one meal (the whole meat only meal)\n\n\u00b7 All animals in this list ate at least one meal in the previous year. All animals ate during the same year (see chart below).\n\nA good lesson may be found by you for the fact that humans are quite intelligent; they are often not even capable of knowing how they eat something the way you know they do. In fact, some scientists believe that we are even smarter than people, and have even found ways to improve our understanding of animal behavior using research. If you are a biologist living in a lab, you now know that it is perfectly fine to eat foods that are more than 1\/10th the length of the human body. Now you know some of the tricks people use to make living lives better.\n\nAs long as we keep talking about how good we are at what we do to care our own well, and even when we are not talking about all human's, we will remain alive.\n\nRead more from Forbes on this point.\n\nPhoto Credit: Shutterstock, Pixabay","token_len":592,"entropy":[8.4374,2.558,0.031,11.5885,0.0181,9.3203,2.2125,5.8043,6.6587,5.2418,1.4768,4.6868,1.4253,5.5458,6.5681,0.4,8.7171,1.2544,3.2433,3.5002,4.6933,3.4444,0.0624,0.8954,9.3767,1.78,1.7821,2.7662,9.1134,4.1036,0.8907,0.8625,1.8572,0.0215,6.0017,0.1402,4.9284,6.8644,2.6602,3.8366,4.2314,5.5151,6.1374,2.2503,2.3045,3.6324,4.7742,2.5304,3.4533,3.7576,1.6959,2.4708,3.5994,1.6184,5.5786,0.9415,3.7978,3.8334,5.0047,4.041,0.1552,3.2918,3.1771,1.8953,5.6071,3.9316,4.122,3.4256,2.8374,2.873,0.3686,1.2661,0.0002,3.7884,5.5484,4.4021,5.2934,4.3991,1.4705,0.7616,3.0472,1.0046,4.4042,4.5756,0.1869,5.2031,2.5457,3.0218,3.115,5.3364,0.8994,0.5932,0.2952,2.9066,3.2465,3.6228,1.1501,6.5822,2.7312,4.4027,4.2746,5.3812,0.5389,6.0609,0.1038,0.4902,3.4656,2.1268,4.577,2.2978,4.068,2.9762,5.2041,1.7133,1.3401,4.3482,2.691,3.0634,0.4136,1.0237,3.2033,5.8172,5.0539,1.518,2.435,1.4454,4.2705,0.4015,4.7846,2.9458,4.0607,4.2315,2.9075,2.693,4.0276,3.0652,4.8142,2.0049,2.4655,0.1183,2.166,4.9037,3.2304,1.664,1.1932,5.3229,1.7799,1.9362,4.4916,4.5092,1.1529,6.0105,4.7438,3.3427,4.7551,0.7254,4.5922,3.0413,0.0213,3.9401,4.2549,1.6447,1.5267,4.1637,2.6649,3.472,2.2713,1.7832,3.5264,3.218,3.1426,1.2917,4.0553,2.6678,1.6702,5.5006,3.6746,3.5063,3.2308,5.7184,2.3645,1.83,0.0066,0.6631,0.4606,0.5377,0.0002,3.2416,3.2039,5.2719,6.1344,1.6721,2.2654,3.5914,4.1539,3.3268,5.0126,1.7859,4.5782,5.0741,0.0028,1.0659,4.1626,0.9717,0.3181,4.1034,2.424,3.2097,2.5034,1.9658,2.8749,6.0101,3.1229,4.3578,2.4033,0.2904,2.2,3.7813,0.0373,2.2954,2.527,2.7087,4.6453,4.6295,4.4261,1.3249,1.5101,1.5338,1.1675,1.88,3.0156,0.51,1.093,5.0398,0.6493,0.9411,5.7086,2.8793,3.2157,0.3057,0.3166,1.8971,4.5604,1.0212,3.4263,1.1129,0.923,1.7633,0.7694,0.4684,1.2044,0.2988,0.0002,5.7652,4.681,4.0232,5.1722,2.8817,4.2507,4.3361,0.4424,4.1353,2.6051,0.0002,0.0349,1.2859,1.7284,1.6699,3.0792,2.3152,2.2712,5.5434,4.333,4.4919,5.0065,5.8901,4.849,0.2947,0.2973,0.0002,0.053,0.5882,0.3954,1.0572,2.9724,1.0886,1.6333,0.7161,3.284,0.3587,0.1173,0.02,0.317,0.0002,0.1216,0.4072,0.181,0.4442,2.6249,0.2132,0.2291,0.1138,0.1233,0.9039,0.1485,0.1194,0.007,0.0094,0.0527,0.0002,0.23,0.3405,3.6851,6.4095,1.2447,0.0495,0.2722,0.0402,0.4566,0.0119,0.0165,0.0043,0.0038,0.0618,0.0002,0.2941,0.3222,0.2896,0.1705,0.1085,0.0054,0.0152,0.0034,0.1496,0.009,0.0047,0.0021,0.0014,0.0518,0.0002,0.3258,0.2726,0.1955,0.0982,0.0713,0.0057,0.0175,0.0034,0.0636,0.0095,0.0048,0.0022,0.0011,0.0537,0.0002,0.3211,0.2171,0.0941,0.0568,0.0334,0.0077,0.0143,0.0029,0.034,0.008,0.0051,0.0021,0.0009,0.052,0.0002,0.2986,0.1729,0.0553,0.038,0.0232,0.0047,0.012,0.0024,0.0218,0.007,0.0056,0.0021,0.0008,0.0495,0.0002,0.2726,5.8052,1.7243,2.7754,0.9235,2.5721,3.0543,2.0806,0.0246,0.7573,0.1902,2.6717,1.2122,2.5108,1.5206,1.7914,4.985,0.723,3.5273,5.5159,0.4638,2.834,2.1048,3.1158,4.883,3.3202,0.8198,0.6786,0.3015,0.0002,4.7134,3.9216,5.955,7.0217,0.4102,3.5574,3.7316,5.2888,5.1683,2.5957,3.8671,0.0284,2.7032,0.9703,5.344,2.4068,5.8373,1.8196,1.1714,4.7601,3.5309,2.8845,4.286,0.0246,3.5409,2.1815,3.1743,4.7557,6.2691,6.3267,0.879,2.2114,3.2938,2.2357,0.7539,0.2431,3.6234,0.5973,0.0953,3.2906,3.0922,1.4969,0.3664,2.0562,0.9226,3.4449,1.7207,0.1431,4.9975,2.2698,1.8326,4.0306,2.2426,4.2266,1.6019,0.2349,2.514,0.632,2.5429,0.1544,4.8799,0.3129,4.4092,5.794,1.1806,4.4954,0.6008,1.4459,2.1966,4.6635,6.3529,0.2122,1.4742,3.5224,0.9007,1.2198,7.3968,0.4671,0.9345,3.5994,0.3323,5.4333,2.0732,0.3519,2.8031,5.4729,0.5773,0.8786,4.1066,2.0109,3.8358,0.9056,1.7436,0.2768,1.2496,4.7559,0.1524,1.6688,1.3396,0.8599,0.6481,5.8651,2.4373,1.0544,6.9932,0.9286,0.1697,4.8091,4.1532,0.7285,0.1605,2.3184,5.8275,4.5964,1.1295,0.7769,0.6698,0.0002,4.4924,4.6308,0.0091,1.3448,3.219,4.9182,0.1229,2.4073,3.7461,0.8427,0.2763,1.014,2.6902,0.019,0.3528,4.634,5.3851,8.1619,2.5419,2.2419,1.0269,2.9044,4.8564,2.1217,0.3033,2.0656,1.9557,2.9484,0.0661,4.8965,4.8927,6.0287,1.1236,0.9297,1.3316,4.676,5.1459,0.836,1.6683,0.0002,4.4629,1.0374,2.328,1.6765,2.6607,2.7189,5.7282,0.9031,0.9516,0.0002,4.01,1.4412,0.049,1.9565,3.8473,3.5162,0.1476,0.0001]}
{"id":2342,"ended":true,"length":564,"gen_text":"As virtual reality continues to develop, users can download scenarios and fantasies using the likeness of celebrities. An actress is threatening to sue, and buys a VR rig to research the lengths at which her image has been wrongfully used.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean that those people won't need to download a free account in order to make it illegal. While there are still many legal loopholes that can be exploited, it's hard to see how using an app that encourages users to make it illegal without understanding its risks and benefits is actually any better.\n\nA group called Black Box Games has put together a list of these situations, and the following are just some that have surfaced:\n\n\u2022 When customers make purchases based solely on images and sounds\n\n\u2022 As a matter of practice, most people with headsets or the ability to walk away may use this app at some point before attempting to download a game that they consider to be illegal\n\n\u2022 As part of an account holder scheme, users who wish to download game and video content can opt out and still buy it from the app\n\n\u2022 Other users who have opted-out of the program won't receive money from the app, even if they purchase the content on a store.\n\nThese types of online actions are what create the notion of a criminal act. If someone is wrongfully using the app to track their purchases and sell them, then the public can reasonably expect them to forfeit their right to do so. At the same time, the game developers and game players don't really need to prove the existence of criminal activity in order to justify selling that content as they find it.\n\nWhat these problems are, and how will they be fixed, is anybody's guess.\n\nBut it's unlikely that these actions by customers using the app will be so effective as to constitute a criminal offense, at least not when they're used in the context of the actual acts that occurred. The apps do exist to give fans a sense of what's going on under the covers, and there will undoubtedly be cases like these out there. There are people who can't even make it legally, and their users shouldn't really have any problem sharing images of their game, because they can't use an app they absolutely don't like to play.\n\nWhat about that game? If you're looking for a free service, you should absolutely check out this site. If you're one of the 3.5 million people who can't afford a virtual reality headset for absolutely nothing, you can now get a free headset over at Gear VR. If you are going to buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy this, then this is the option for you.\n\nYou can see that there are two things going on with these actions by the players \u2014 the game creators and the game consumers. Let all of these players become legally liable for whatever actions they take to get something free.","token_len":592,"entropy":[10.5983,1.561,5.4525,0.0686,4.2909,0.5649,5.2593,3.2279,6.3687,9.7845,1.9783,8.6959,4.52,1.8418,11.7756,1.7181,5.7363,2.3046,5.7561,5.3433,3.4585,10.1459,0.3826,1.7621,4.9924,1.6402,11.0861,0.817,3.7285,7.0095,1.8468,8.2757,1.659,10.3461,7.0461,0.002,2.3944,7.2118,4.4955,1.0427,9.1074,1.1771,2.7715,0.4802,1.1207,0.0003,5.5507,0.0412,4.7687,1.8272,0.0003,0.4574,1.7932,5.0573,4.2105,2.9768,0.0007,5.3136,0.555,4.4419,2.5868,4.8272,4.8918,3.8713,0.0414,0.0302,3.9186,2.9824,5.6242,1.0055,4.9479,2.8356,0.602,3.18,2.3452,3.4442,3.2351,1.99,1.5644,0.5241,0.3863,0.8705,2.3764,0.5058,3.8276,0.1713,1.9938,0.4769,5.5701,2.7704,2.1051,2.2344,5.141,1.6169,0.0255,3.7825,4.4731,0.5202,4.493,5.3675,2.0768,4.0158,3.374,1.8328,1.4778,4.1869,4.7461,1.9408,1.6348,0.512,0.0002,4.5069,5.5925,1.6849,5.693,3.2798,4.3096,1.7644,4.1992,0.3749,0.3274,1.3105,0.0269,5.3558,4.8101,1.8957,1.2282,2.9407,4.3026,2.1841,2.0379,1.8255,3.6315,1.5998,3.0575,2.3446,0.2291,0.0001,4.1155,4.5568,6.2473,4.2251,1.9437,4.491,3.841,0.0198,4.2929,3.0982,6.0188,3.1597,0.0002,0.02,5.3557,1.7962,5.1778,0.0017,3.9909,0.1646,4.4695,2.5595,5.6311,5.5625,3.9888,5.4687,1.4163,0.0324,5.4784,5.4394,5.0758,4.3209,3.7177,2.5942,5.1444,1.2775,0.0226,3.6237,5.4068,0.1827,3.3813,1.3331,1.5878,3.2149,2.8648,4.6743,1.8264,0.1027,1.4284,1.9292,0.0002,0.0371,2.9049,3.2906,0.0014,2.3663,5.8493,3.4769,4.3499,0.6885,1.9124,3.2001,4.7964,0.0136,2.3065,4.2706,4.7745,3.61,1.0611,2.936,3.9469,0.9886,3.4245,4.8906,3.3398,2.1995,2.9881,1.3893,0.8425,1.4005,0.0002,0.0661,5.8552,1.7081,1.8627,2.2423,3.5979,1.6573,0.4848,0.927,1.1615,3.5686,6.065,0.0009,2.9415,5.0606,1.6261,0.3415,0.6569,1.8526,2.9156,0.3048,0.2642,2.6328,1.1436,2.3788,3.4888,2.0289,4.6584,2.7168,0.6231,0.0001,4.7607,3.6763,0.0011,5.9893,4.2909,1.1622,5.1794,5.1497,1.2825,5.6925,0.7434,2.0004,4.201,1.6479,1.2128,3.1174,3.05,1.9458,5.6307,0.0329,0.9343,1.7107,0.648,1.9112,5.9083,1.5705,2.0301,1.9455,4.6123,0.959,1.2728,2.0015,2.3191,5.4764,2.2659,5.0365,1.0037,2.155,0.034,5.6812,0.8041,1.3208,0.0292,4.5425,0.0696,0.3618,6.0314,0.6862,0.7915,0.0024,0.0347,2.1409,5.4669,2.4461,2.2608,2.8873,4.9559,4.7122,0.0003,3.9383,1.8893,0.2939,5.1807,2.8514,3.7456,0.0506,4.5841,1.0888,2.8607,0.016,0.1901,3.0188,4.6188,4.9626,0.891,5.255,3.2595,5.194,0.4097,1.0414,0.5564,0.0001,4.1281,4.5652,5.0225,2.0961,1.9807,2.6574,1.1773,5.9045,0.7485,1.2385,2.9776,0.6543,1.0962,5.6372,0.003,0.0008,0.3503,2.4546,0.0002,3.17,2.7552,0.5161,4.8172,0.2867,2.6752,3.4357,5.6941,5.8745,5.5157,1.0066,0.3577,0.2705,1.5772,5.3958,4.0462,1.0871,0.0894,4.3856,0.6161,0.65,1.6585,1.8219,3.1984,0.0296,0.7434,4.2852,1.9141,1.0436,3.4412,1.7659,1.6675,1.1122,0.0129,2.3469,3.0468,4.9574,1.7761,3.0528,0.5048,2.8452,5.5018,4.4113,3.0398,1.9485,3.9161,5.5091,1.6254,2.213,0.0628,1.2424,1.6347,0.8154,0.0138,6.0261,0.183,3.716,0.797,0.8306,3.7686,4.4061,3.3428,0.0441,3.2804,3.2552,1.2234,4.2203,0.439,1.1877,4.7065,1.1331,4.5527,0.8463,4.0066,1.5501,2.8069,3.6848,1.3676,4.0823,2.9871,0.7094,4.8008,5.6347,4.8269,0.0002,4.3415,1.438,2.1093,2.3994,5.4821,4.5975,1.5619,1.3568,5.4935,3.5641,3.213,1.5152,2.4734,2.0446,3.6039,3.4787,0.0936,4.407,5.9634,1.604,0.0007,1.5075,1.3313,1.0878,0.4735,0.4895,0.0002,3.9259,3.2168,5.032,3.7473,2.1107,3.2405,1.1653,1.4447,3.3702,0.4998,0.9664,2.6514,4.7704,1.6508,2.03,2.0457,4.7644,1.8408,0.4171,2.824,2.576,0.9111,2.5716,0.2754,0.7275,5.5678,0.0945,1.1504,6.5483,2.149,0.8227,0.1053,0.9674,0.3804,4.605,0.2628,2.177,1.6679,4.2913,0.0581,0.4791,3.8628,6.5885,1.3632,0.192,1.6751,1.8715,3.7661,2.0778,1.9222,0.9408,1.9513,6.3396,0.7746,2.7078,0.3972,0.4087,2.6409,0.1908,3.8319,4.6496,0.0664,1.935,4.4573,2.5426,0.4459,0.3174,0.4658,0.1433,0.4481,0.236,0.4161,0.2583,4.6463,3.0761,2.9411,3.1571,0.5593,1.0681,5.4061,1.7646,0.0042,0.0772,0.8638,0.0002,3.9619,0.3065,3.5975,4.5546,2.9118,0.4834,4.0289,3.5058,1.8827,0.07,2.4796,2.8333,3.6725,2.2364,2.4382,3.7824,6.2994,1.8876,2.9612,3.085,0.8036,0.2484,1.5334,3.9049,0.2439,5.3526,9.2412,0.9743,1.7823,2.0277,5.7512,5.0903,1.5234,0.5306,4.977,1.4876,0.4195,0.9851,2.4335,3.58,4.6976,3.0635,1.1545]}
{"id":4704,"ended":false,"length":555,"gen_text":"You can communicate with your past self, but only with one tweet a day that can only go back 24 hours.\n\n. Follow that example for the new self and then put it back\n\nHere's another way to make it easier on the future self:\n\nSay you write in a blog post: \"This could change my life,\" and you publish your future self.\n\nThen after 24 hours, the previous self will go away, and the new self will still have you writing that blog post.\n\nThis happens for all your future self : it will always write that blog post, but every time you upload it, it will get sent back as a tweet.\n\nHere's the problem: you don't want your future self to know what to do with your future self's future self tweets, nor do you want anyone else doing that, so it's really your future self who decides what you can be happy with, and there's no way you can help us.\n\nIf things got out of control, it wouldn't make any difference, but if they did, you might get your future self to send a tweet to you instead of telling you about it.\n\nThe most convenient way to use the old self to give yourself more power, is with the \"New Self!\" feature.\n\nThe old self is already \"unhealthy\" because it was written by your future self, so every time you upload the blog post, you've replaced it, even if the user doesn't understand your post.\n\nThis means it's too easy- to tell your future self when you wrote that post if it's old and only writing the blog post right afterward.\n\nWe'll try this by giving you an example:\n\nThere's a young person who hasn't done anything since high school. She is excited to get her doctor's appointment. Her future self comments on her blog post by saying that she was going to get an appointment with the new day care staff when it was going well.\n\nThe future self looks down on her blog post by saying, \"How can I fix this?

{"id":2343,"ended":true,"length":574,"gen_text":"You find out you're a time traveller because archeologists visit after finding an object with a note on it, from you.\n '.\nThe idea is to put those kind of items together and you need to find out if they make sense for us. I know we want to keep them that way.\nIt's hard to put into words what it is.\nYou probably understand right now that all time travellers and explorers have to meet all sorts of expectations and expectations about how they visit us.\nThe first time you were introduced to the new Travelling world, we spent our first few hours in your city. You were very, very fascinated with it but for some reason you've never heard of it. A few of us were very intrigued by it at first.\nYou did know that Travelling is the first time you'll live in this new world because we have a lot of really neat things to do and some exciting things we're very happy with there. We think it's the first time you'll have so much freedom with the world.\nI've noticed that the idea of this whole new world of explorers and explorers from around the world just gets to me too.\nYou know, when you go to work you're already looking around for lots of places. When you're out in the public space, you only see what's out there, sometimes things. Sometimes we just see the scenery. You know you always want to come back there but you never know what we'll do, even if you get there in time.\nThe reason we're taking this to a different world is because it's about time you start to learn how to talk, be curious, learn a lot of things you don't understand - and this is how we did at Utopia.\nWhen we have very long conversations about something I don't understand or what is important to say, things start to flow around you. People will ask, why did I say I was going to London? Well it's because it was only when you are going through some really interesting things that we could bring people in. If you want, you want to spend a lot more time talking and taking your time.\nOf course, if you do things right you'll do even more things. We thought about doing one more thing with us.\nIt's all about your personal life. So, you think about being on the train. It's kind of important now to be honest, to take up less space. It's going to take lots of time to spend some time thinking about people.\nWhen we opened up our doors in Utopia, it was huge. When we opened up the hotel room, you didn't see any people.\nI really got my first impression from seeing these people.

A Skill (an ability the character must know and gain proficiency with); or\n\nA Skill that is an ability you can learn or have the character level increase from.\n\nOther items that may be useful are:\n\nWeapons that are a standard or exotic weapon, such as an orcish axe or pike.\n\nWeapons that are a heavy weapon with a bonus against attack rolls, checks, or skill checks.\n\nWeapons that can be obtained by trading, such as from trading on Orgrimmar and completing a Guild, to increase the cost of crafting your skills.\n\nSorting items for your inventory, such as crafting your items that you hold.\n\nMiscellaneous information like armor, special item IDs, items, and weapon-related items.","token_len":594,"entropy":[8.3834,3.8174,3.508,0.1712,0.5168,9.4384,0.7712,7.9477,4.0212,4.8569,2.5441,3.7632,6.3936,6.7316,2.303,1.9388,9.9507,3.5508,1.7871,5.7314,2.7019,0.01,6.706,3.5339,0.8115,0.133,3.8055,1.4166,6.8989,2.3415,1.3227,0.0036,7.4242,2.0947,0.0696,7.3199,0.0339,4.5274,2.4723,3.7505,1.0314,2.9106,3.5962,0.8059,1.2299,0.0002,4.2509,0.0733,0.0025,0.0033,0.0016,0.0008,1.4688,0.5199,1.3496,0.0075,1.8177,0.152,0.2271,0.2504,5.0123,0.4464,0.2983,0.0001,3.6838,2.654,5.0905,0.1674,0.3882,1.0524,0.7766,2.0791,1.9754,2.9786,5.0771,6.4251,2.0629,0.003,2.251,4.8242,1.6217,3.8848,0.4741,0.0001,3.5539,2.5751,4.4927,2.6499,2.9564,5.4993,3.7569,3.4789,5.4869,2.4055,1.1626,0.3138,0.0001,3.6504,0.8672,1.1308,0.0216,1.3559,0.622,0.4543,0.2157,2.0206,0.5588,0.1096,0.0001,1.0818,1.308,0.1106,0.0098,0.0481,1.6479,0.4572,0.229,0.0001,0.8639,0.9228,0.1469,0.0125,0.0717,1.0365,0.073,0.1472,0.0001,5.5628,2.6656,0.0183,0.0095,0.0014,0.0056,5.4957,0.6114,5.3949,0.6479,4.849,1.0929,0.3853,0.0002,7.6345,0.6346,0.0125,0.2471,0.0011,0.0156,0.0024,0.5264,4.4338,5.6868,2.8332,1.2583,0.3416,4.3905,2.94,2.5417,0.4617,1.0812,0.6183,0.1846,0.0001,1.0817,1.306,0.8429,0.0509,0.1275,0.0168,0.0252,0.0046,0.0069,0.0093,0.0048,0.0012,0.4612,0.7787,0.4671,0.0504,0.1826,0.1479,0.0675,0.0866,0.0472,2.645,2.1234,3.1328,0.8609,0.3022,0.1158,0.0537,0.0001,0.8368,0.7609,0.2775,0.0222,0.0467,0.0091,0.0171,0.0112,0.0161,1.0496,4.6205,7.2249,2.3902,3.4423,2.5056,4.7074,0.4691,0.3027,0.049,0.0002,0.9896,7.5425,2.0863,1.1122,2.6256,1.4058,3.0776,2.746,1.2574,3.3499,0.8942,0.2235,0.0001,5.7562,0.7898,3.3371,1.6915,0.5972,3.4917,4.5861,4.0366,0.5804,1.2487,0.7704,5.8092,1.6832,0.3038,0.2057,0.0001,3.7355,0.6215,3.4637,2.9311,2.8843,1.4266,0.2917,5.8117,4.265,1.7638,1.0082,1.4799,5.0619,0.827,0.4652,0.0001,6.0397,3.5557,2.9075,0.8729,0.2773,0.8682,2.8043,5.9221,3.4533,0.3619,3.2467,1.8149,6.2609,5.2036,2.4223,0.0017,3.8648,1.7695,4.8085,2.1522,1.2484,4.1608,4.7313,3.7046,0.785,0.5958,0.6792,5.4076,3.959,0.4464,2.5024,1.9921,4.23,5.5907,2.9829,3.8954,3.5072,2.784,2.2352,3.7369,1.6024,2.0625,0.9669,0.2702,0.5773,0.0002,4.6106,0.0356,0.7818,0.4526,0.0713,0.1318,7.1732,2.1303,1.6363,0.1464,4.1811,1.864,1.7865,5.4062,3.2349,2.8858,1.3112,3.3744,2.4656,0.7187,5.2241,3.7414,0.2152,5.3704,1.2179,0.4087,0.121,2.5644,0.5682,4.2512,1.0839,2.5124,5.6919,2.4381,5.2037,2.2507,1.638,0.6908,4.4153,2.4372,1.48,3.0073,6.0694,5.9516,0.788,5.7383,4.1274,3.5056,0.8955,4.0756,1.2319,0.4918,1.3813,0.3999,1.295,2.7381,4.4217,1.566,5.9199,4.6894,1.2173,0.5733,0.3755,0.5535,0.5577,0.0001,2.5103,0.0126,0.2015,0.1467,3.1505,2.7653,3.1445,2.4476,3.3973,4.0921,0.9418,3.6878,5.7806,1.5162,0.0001,3.7779,3.2028,2.5823,2.4244,6.046,6.7492,0.0594,0.8667,0.3736,4.4681,0.573,0.0001,4.7706,1.7324,0.607,3.1775,4.8836,2.0357,2.6575,3.2288,0.3802,6.2532,1.6022,1.418,3.6512,3.8527,4.0538,0.0803,1.9355,1.132,0.1242,0.0003,3.6159,0.6865,0.4791,5.181,3.5006,3.3102,5.3226,2.6141,1.4879,3.051,0.1859,0.0002,3.3161,0.5747,0.1381,3.0569,0.7762,0.0169,0.4454,0.0025,0.0057,0.098,2.1867,4.6481,2.5679,2.0921,0.5782,5.4257,0.6012,3.5655,2.4138,2.6051,3.8473,2.1468,0.3867,0.6667,1.8074,0.2259,0.0004,1.6712,1.3229,2.1327,2.1538,3.3572,1.9965,3.083,2.469,1.3129,2.3462,2.5361,2.9041,0.4828,4.5428,3.6999,2.0539,0.7592,0.2623,0.0002,5.1703,3.277,1.0695,2.1056,0.4648,0.5921,3.7295,0.9294,0.1152,0.0002,3.4427,1.1877,1.8327,4.2921,4.0068,2.506,4.8488,0.8938,1.9927,1.0662,0.0016,3.2445,5.1587,0.4481,4.1761,1.1132,5.6614,0.3071,0.9981,0.1997,0.0002,2.0723,0.1196,0.5545,0.9767,5.3604,1.5349,3.7011,0.6597,4.8002,5.0001,3.8777,0.3465,1.5302,6.048,0.2482,1.5716,3.5808,0.0664,0.6019,0.0958,0.0002,1.8962,0.2496,2.8178,0.497,5.1809,1.8013,4.2294,2.3636,1.38,0.0016,3.516,4.6234,4.2645,6.0357,2.3137,0.0016,3.6699,5.3115,2.4998,5.9913,5.1195,5.5466,3.848,1.5472,2.8391,0.1986,3.3738,2.0991,5.2519,0.3636,0.1429,0.0002,5.1901,3.2368,1.7987,4.0729,1.4295,2.9635,2.749,1.1335,0.0068,3.412,3.2242,3.3772,4.6503,1.7259,5.8865,1.4855,0.2383,0.0001,5.7918,0.0012,3.5955,3.8226,4.0988,0.7979,5.9751,5.4754,5.0388,0.1545,4.3074,2.6189,1.2693,4.3728,5.3822,1.592,1.4526,0.5623]}
{"id":2803,"ended":true,"length":558,"gen_text":"A speedster with insomnia, a sleepwalking teleporter and a telekinetic with ADHD are just three of your many patients. Other treatments can help, but the goal is not to treat autism.\n\nBut what about people who say they cannot get a job? That is the problem, and that's why we need a lot of research into other ways autism can affect employment.\n\nA few researchers have tried different solutions. The most popular is using a brain imaging device to measure brain activity in people at low and high risk for autism. But these studies are limited. The problem is with so many different people who can perform the tasks, how can they know they're doing what they are supposed to with their brains? Can they know if any one of those people will respond with a particular activity or with patterns they have no idea about? One simple technique was used to test its effectiveness: By seeing your brain activity patterns and working out what will lead to your particular activity, you can measure the brain activity of a person, so you know whether they won't work out their specific response or not. This also helps determine if other groups might not perform the same set of tasks, too.\n\nAnd that's where you get the real trick\u2014an interesting way to understand the brain's response to different jobs. The way to do this is with machines.\n\nThe \"brain scans\" were created by Dr. Todoroki Kojalczyk's team. These tests measure brain activity directly instead of at the point of the eyes. They also ask people to record the same brain signal at different times, which shows when the person is in front of the device and when the device is resting.\n\nThe computer program makes this decision by giving each individual at the beginning a score of 0 or 3 to choose between 1, 3 and 7 on the brains:\n\nThen, they take turns looking at the brain activity for different tasks (2 for simple tasks or 3 for complex ones) and at the exact same time. Those who successfully complete these tasks get a new score. Those who have trouble completing easy, difficult or complex tasks are at a disadvantage.\n\nIt's clear that the machines have a lot more data. So they do even more tasks, but what about those who can't afford a brain computer? That is the question we should be talking about today.\n\nThe answer now comes after 10 years of research and many many tests performed over that time.\n\nFor those who can afford, it means you'll get a new high school diploma, health insurance, a new job and maybe even a new family member that won't be a complete stranger from school to work again for you.\n\nI hope it's all well for you and good luck.\n\nThis post may contain links to Amazon or other partners; your purchases via these links can benefit Serious Eats.

A Skill (an ability the character must know and gain proficiency with); or\n\nA Skill that is an ability you can learn or have the character level increase from.\n\nOther items that may be useful are:\n\nWeapons that are a standard or exotic weapon, such as an orcish axe or pike.\n\nWeapons that are a heavy weapon with a bonus against attack rolls, checks, or skill checks.\n\nWeapons that can be obtained by trading, such as from trading on Orgrimmar and completing a Guild, to increase the cost of crafting your skills.\n\nSorting items for your inventory, such as crafting your items that you hold.\n\nMiscellaneous information like armor, special item IDs, items, and weapon-related items.","token_len":594,"entropy":[8.3834,3.8174,3.508,0.1712,0.5168,9.4384,0.7712,7.9477,4.0212,4.8569,2.5441,3.7632,6.3936,6.7316,2.303,1.9388,9.9507,3.5508,1.7871,5.7314,2.7019,0.01,6.706,3.5339,0.8115,0.133,3.8055,1.4166,6.8989,2.3415,1.3227,0.0036,7.4242,2.0947,0.0696,7.3199,0.0339,4.5274,2.4723,3.7505,1.0314,2.9106,3.5962,0.8059,1.2299,0.0002,4.2509,0.0733,0.0025,0.0033,0.0016,0.0008,1.4688,0.5199,1.3496,0.0075,1.8177,0.152,0.2271,0.2504,5.0123,0.4464,0.2983,0.0001,3.6838,2.654,5.0905,0.1674,0.3882,1.0524,0.7766,2.0791,1.9754,2.9786,5.0771,6.4251,2.0629,0.003,2.251,4.8242,1.6217,3.8848,0.4741,0.0001,3.5539,2.5751,4.4927,2.6499,2.9564,5.4993,3.7569,3.4789,5.4869,2.4055,1.1626,0.3138,0.0001,3.6504,0.8672,1.1308,0.0216,1.3559,0.622,0.4543,0.2157,2.0206,0.5588,0.1096,0.0001,1.0818,1.308,0.1106,0.0098,0.0481,1.6479,0.4572,0.229,0.0001,0.8639,0.9228,0.1469,0.0125,0.0717,1.0365,0.073,0.1472,0.0001,5.5628,2.6656,0.0183,0.0095,0.0014,0.0056,5.4957,0.6114,5.3949,0.6479,4.849,1.0929,0.3853,0.0002,7.6345,0.6346,0.0125,0.2471,0.0011,0.0156,0.0024,0.5264,4.4338,5.6868,2.8332,1.2583,0.3416,4.3905,2.94,2.5417,0.4617,1.0812,0.6183,0.1846,0.0001,1.0817,1.306,0.8429,0.0509,0.1275,0.0168,0.0252,0.0046,0.0069,0.0093,0.0048,0.0012,0.4612,0.7787,0.4671,0.0504,0.1826,0.1479,0.0675,0.0866,0.0472,2.645,2.1234,3.1328,0.8609,0.3022,0.1158,0.0537,0.0001,0.8368,0.7609,0.2775,0.0222,0.0467,0.0091,0.0171,0.0112,0.0161,1.0496,4.6205,7.2249,2.3902,3.4423,2.5056,4.7074,0.4691,0.3027,0.049,0.0002,0.9896,7.5425,2.0863,1.1122,2.6256,1.4058,3.0776,2.746,1.2574,3.3499,0.8942,0.2235,0.0001,5.7562,0.7898,3.3371,1.6915,0.5972,3.4917,4.5861,4.0366,0.5804,1.2487,0.7704,5.8092,1.6832,0.3038,0.2057,0.0001,3.7355,0.6215,3.4637,2.9311,2.8843,1.4266,0.2917,5.8117,4.265,1.7638,1.0082,1.4799,5.0619,0.827,0.4652,0.0001,6.0397,3.5557,2.9075,0.8729,0.2773,0.8682,2.8043,5.9221,3.4533,0.3619,3.2467,1.8149,6.2609,5.2036,2.4223,0.0017,3.8648,1.7695,4.8085,2.1522,1.2484,4.1608,4.7313,3.7046,0.785,0.5958,0.6792,5.4076,3.959,0.4464,2.5024,1.9921,4.23,5.5907,2.9829,3.8954,3.5072,2.784,2.2352,3.7369,1.6024,2.0625,0.9669,0.2702,0.5773,0.0002,4.6106,0.0356,0.7818,0.4526,0.0713,0.1318,7.1732,2.1303,1.6363,0.1464,4.1811,1.864,1.7865,5.4062,3.2349,2.8858,1.3112,3.3744,2.4656,0.7187,5.2241,3.7414,0.2152,5.3704,1.2179,0.4087,0.121,2.5644,0.5682,4.2512,1.0839,2.5124,5.6919,2.4381,5.2037,2.2507,1.638,0.6908,4.4153,2.4372,1.48,3.0073,6.0694,5.9516,0.788,5.7383,4.1274,3.5056,0.8955,4.0756,1.2319,0.4918,1.3813,0.3999,1.295,2.7381,4.4217,1.566,5.9199,4.6894,1.2173,0.5733,0.3755,0.5535,0.5577,0.0001,2.5103,0.0126,0.2015,0.1467,3.1505,2.7653,3.1445,2.4476,3.3973,4.0921,0.9418,3.6878,5.7806,1.5162,0.0001,3.7779,3.2028,2.5823,2.4244,6.046,6.7492,0.0594,0.8667,0.3736,4.4681,0.573,0.0001,4.7706,1.7324,0.607,3.1775,4.8836,2.0357,2.6575,3.2288,0.3802,6.2532,1.6022,1.418,3.6512,3.8527,4.0538,0.0803,1.9355,1.132,0.1242,0.0003,3.6159,0.6865,0.4791,5.181,3.5006,3.3102,5.3226,2.6141,1.4879,3.051,0.1859,0.0002,3.3161,0.5747,0.1381,3.0569,0.7762,0.0169,0.4454,0.0025,0.0057,0.098,2.1867,4.6481,2.5679,2.0921,0.5782,5.4257,0.6012,3.5655,2.4138,2.6051,3.8473,2.1468,0.3867,0.6667,1.8074,0.2259,0.0004,1.6712,1.3229,2.1327,2.1538,3.3572,1.9965,3.083,2.469,1.3129,2.3462,2.5361,2.9041,0.4828,4.5428,3.6999,2.0539,0.7592,0.2623,0.0002,5.1703,3.277,1.0695,2.1056,0.4648,0.5921,3.7295,0.9294,0.1152,0.0002,3.4427,1.1877,1.8327,4.2921,4.0068,2.506,4.8488,0.8938,1.9927,1.0662,0.0016,3.2445,5.1587,0.4481,4.1761,1.1132,5.6614,0.3071,0.9981,0.1997,0.0002,2.0723,0.1196,0.5545,0.9767,5.3604,1.5349,3.7011,0.6597,4.8002,5.0001,3.8777,0.3465,1.5302,6.048,0.2482,1.5716,3.5808,0.0664,0.6019,0.0958,0.0002,1.8962,0.2496,2.8178,0.497,5.1809,1.8013,4.2294,2.3636,1.38,0.0016,3.516,4.6234,4.2645,6.0357,2.3137,0.0016,3.6699,5.3115,2.4998,5.9913,5.1195,5.5466,3.848,1.5472,2.8391,0.1986,3.3738,2.0991,5.2519,0.3636,0.1429,0.0002,5.1901,3.2368,1.7987,4.0729,1.4295,2.9635,2.749,1.1335,0.0068,3.412,3.2242,3.3772,4.6503,1.7259,5.8865,1.4855,0.2383,0.0001,5.7918,0.0012,3.5955,3.8226,4.0988,0.7979,5.9751,5.4754,5.0388,0.1545,4.3074,2.6189,1.2693,4.3728,5.3822,1.592,1.4526,0.5623]}
{"id":2896,"ended":false,"length":538,"gen_text":"After a careful analysis, NASA realizes that there is actually a Dyson sphere around the our sun. We didn't put it there.\n\nHowever, that is exactly what they say. But who can prove that it exists because of the Dyson sphere? The answers should never be known.\n\nWhen you have a mass that could be described as massless with respect to time and space, then you have to explain why and when the mass could have been described, and that is why it must have formed at that time. Then, you must explain why this mass could have been produced. On the other hand, who can show that this mass could have never existed but for some way?\n\nIf you say this mass must have been an infinite or a non-empty. As a gravitational force is always in a constant direction with respect to space, this mass can exist even after a massive change in your speed, and the new mass can be called an infinite, meaning that there must not have been zero.\n\nIf so, then the masses have only a finite period. If the mass is a number or a constant, then that is not something new. Suppose this mass is equal to a number. Then (we can see from the fact that the mass is one ) the mass has a constant amplitude for (1\/(1+1)) then\n\nIf (that is, we have a mass of 3 and an amplitude of 4 times the amplitude ) the mass has a constant amplitude. If, then that is asymptotic or unsupervised. What is this true for a mass that is zero? And when you start to add further particles, you will see that the mass is continuous. In other words, there is nothing that should be observed at the beginning of the mass which may not exist.\n\nWhat I didn't realize is that, in fact,. The mass can be estimated at time x\n\nSo (2*0x.01^20.01^40)\n\nThe mass of the sun's center is found for the center of the mass. If (2, 1, 1^2 ), then (3, 1, 1^2 ) and (4, 1, 1^2 ) as you can see, then. The entire mass is found for the sun's center.\n\nWith each particle and the sun's center on the same line, it appears. That is, if we have the right particle and the left one on the same line, it means that we must hold a constant for this particle to be 1. And so then, the total momentum of the solar mass after the sun has formed is given by (\\begin{align*} n end-product \\\\ n \\times n-1\\\\\\end{align*}\\n)\n\nSo (3, 0, 1^2, 2 * x + 4 + 3, 1, 1^2 )","token_len":595,"entropy":[3.1393,7.0548,2.959,1.3971,8.2184,9.6958,0.4627,2.8562,1.1168,5.2971,1.1398,8.8498,1.8257,0.58,3.2648,1.1179,10.723,2.3441,1.2777,3.888,5.8038,0.0005,5.5792,1.2915,1.528,2.1566,1.8765,0.0029,5.3055,0.0535,4.2982,2.3211,3.5742,0.3364,3.5686,4.0196,1.2976,5.0818,5.0815,3.768,3.7719,1.0794,2.369,2.5932,5.1704,1.833,1.5166,1.7904,0.0002,0.2876,0.288,2.6359,4.8023,5.5034,5.3204,0.4402,3.1866,1.1033,1.1074,0.0002,4.865,2.4218,3.7657,1.0412,5.5447,1.6211,5.1991,1.3993,2.8146,0.4641,3.6596,0.3082,4.0015,2.4171,0.0022,3.6473,1.7521,0.2437,0.3604,1.9235,1.4732,1.7075,1.5544,3.4786,1.862,5.3447,3.4045,2.4298,0.3977,3.2724,1.4757,0.6055,3.6845,3.8902,1.3615,2.848,1.1172,1.8374,2.1137,3.7062,0.5716,5.5525,2.8181,3.2832,0.6258,0.3285,5.0701,2.3531,1.4296,2.6037,0.6339,0.4871,3.5796,0.2925,1.7906,0.4028,1.0104,2.9583,1.6908,6.6288,0.7766,0.2188,0.0096,0.02,6.3727,0.7259,4.272,0.3744,1.949,0.1018,0.9443,0.3792,5.6671,0.971,5.567,1.4874,1.8838,6.0923,3.5973,0.855,0.0001,3.1256,0.9551,3.1479,3.8008,0.5982,3.3413,0.1883,1.3706,5.4462,3.7538,5.3021,2.2084,3.9971,0.208,2.7564,6.6189,5.7742,2.5477,5.9182,0.9867,3.3929,3.9068,3.7865,2.0213,2.8397,4.583,3.5409,0.5018,0.0019,1.6978,0.5765,3.1494,1.5912,2.8324,2.9496,4.1334,4.0591,2.084,5.0148,3.9953,0.5185,5.3367,4.3837,2.2325,2.2413,3.1809,5.806,0.9533,2.039,1.9673,4.2581,1.4467,0.733,3.1902,5.9824,0.8901,2.8085,1.7793,4.0632,0.8292,0.1277,6.3161,3.1997,1.0486,0.0001,2.2241,6.6567,0.0414,0.6093,1.9431,5.1012,4.1462,4.7375,2.421,1.4827,3.9614,2.2474,2.0466,2.1851,0.9359,1.5106,2.6664,5.8867,3.2762,1.0577,3.3871,0.4332,0.3493,3.0841,1.8173,2.4155,4.4578,4.6938,0.4829,6.5241,3.757,0.2037,1.4178,5.4431,0.0914,1.9541,2.0387,1.9134,1.9296,6.7819,4.9071,1.9148,2.3141,2.4435,0.7565,4.5573,0.0515,1.2787,1.0219,1.1724,5.332,6.3242,1.9285,0.831,2.5819,1.2236,1.9019,5.6197,4.6801,5.3287,1.6094,4.8004,1.3307,1.2914,0.5915,1.9006,5.6145,4.9027,0.0002,2.9272,2.647,5.9457,0.7273,1.5855,2.769,1.812,1.2913,1.5509,1.8566,4.7315,3.7029,3.3105,0.5816,0.2595,3.5018,4.3989,0.9501,2.8945,4.5678,2.4359,0.2958,0.8828,0.3858,0.763,0.3284,3.7057,2.038,3.7685,2.0655,4.193,0.7995,5.8217,1.5427,0.0001,1.655,3.8774,4.59,4.781,0.5289,0.9004,5.4499,1.5332,3.6102,5.8546,1.5588,2.256,1.1958,1.2711,0.7182,4.7903,1.1486,4.3363,4.7249,1.6773,4.7885,0.9789,4.6335,5.8112,5.3625,1.0382,1.7061,2.4919,2.0124,0.4197,1.1516,0.6026,1.2824,6.1558,0.9101,3.8921,0.9832,0.0011,0.1187,2.846,0.7394,2.3188,2.6126,5.4174,1.1667,3.5915,3.7895,1.9147,1.8946,0.5299,0.8116,1.4345,5.4542,4.2541,1.6064,3.7208,1.2259,0.6009,0.0002,3.7172,4.8198,6.1101,0.0007,2.4597,1.4585,0.1596,3.6903,2.2123,2.2827,11.3619,2.1455,1.3998,2.674,1.2018,5.2554,3.1559,4.197,5.1513,4.9113,0.0003,3.0904,5.033,3.9803,3.0818,4.6225,3.8143,4.892,4.1174,3.9102,5.2097,3.8173,2.7281,2.8772,3.8168,1.754,1.7137,0.0003,3.2731,1.1224,2.1655,1.0329,1.2369,5.7001,2.7329,1.0405,5.6116,5.402,1.8855,3.8297,0.4419,0.5596,3.9646,1.8921,2.7225,2.5777,1.6531,6.497,2.4624,1.2443,1.4225,3.8195,1.984,7.5641,0.3217,1.6134,2.5331,0.7972,0.7268,0.4449,0.3916,0.3287,0.2246,1.157,2.5072,1.0676,0.6435,0.0718,0.1575,0.0893,0.1147,0.1407,0.0767,0.4935,5.5276,4.1127,0.8282,0.0946,1.2871,2.8152,5.47,2.4731,6.0475,0.3489,1.4103,1.0155,0.4081,0.4827,2.9328,0.97,0.1202,0.4856,0.9558,0.0002,5.9818,5.3529,1.0677,4.4813,2.0636,4.5782,0.6699,0.6507,5.137,1.0327,1.3784,1.8455,0.3842,2.8,4.3232,4.8295,4.1663,0.5671,0.6559,2.4314,2.2344,2.7295,2.3048,3.8023,2.3978,1.5211,0.4138,1.3134,1.6762,1.5599,0.2949,0.4265,0.0547,0.3373,2.766,4.3727,0.3091,2.2166,3.9126,6.0505,3.2514,1.5792,3.525,3.8813,2.3974,2.6915,0.9208,4.4727,1.1184,3.7161,2.596,5.4417,1.5349,1.6624,3.6597,7.242,0.6229,0.3387,4.1836,2.1795,6.6568,1.105,1.9565,2.3551,1.3055,0.8303,3.8083,0.592,2.0385,5.9363,2.2,0.0023,0.9799,0.4112,0.2915,4.4414,5.2158,3.8398,4.4501,3.006,1.2865,2.6672,2.3783,0.8552,3.3785,0.3988,3.9792,3.7057,0.3767,0.0003,0.0164,0.0026,1.0055,2.4973,2.137,0.9306,0.0002,2.3599,2.3929,1.8134,0.6205,3.6949,0.7571,0.5611,1.4273,0.1758,2.5657,2.3507,5.0928,3.4881,2.7106,2.7444,2.8829,2.2577,2.2108,0.6251,0.6915,0.3983,0.4419,0.0824,2.5809]}

Why's your fault? Why's not your fault? The blame rests elsewhere. And so you say? Well, I feel sorry for you.\n\n- The first ten minutes of this page are the first part of the article.\n\n- How do you feel before this event and when it is over?\n\n- The second ten minutes of this page are the second part of the article.\n\n- How do you feel when it is time to leave your home?\n\n- The 3rd ten minutes are the time it takes to return.\n\n- The 5th ten minutes are the time it takes to leave.\n\n- Once your phone leaves you will have five minutes to explain some basic things about what are happening. There will be no time to explain and none to give up. As soon as there is someone at your place who understands, you have 10 minutes left during which you won't leave your home. If you are in any position to be on the outside speaking from the perspective of someone who knows who you are, you will do your best to remain silent.\n\nIf the answer to one of the questions above is, then the two next question are the same.\n\n- What did you think about the news in the last 3 days?\n\n- If the answer answers the second question then you must start to address. The two questions are, 'Did you really hear me now?', and, 'The last 5 minutes of my time?'.\n\n- How did you feel about the news?\n\n- In our article, we used this moment of silence time at my place to respond to all the questions we've had about I am a person born with the same rights and dignity.

{"id":1259,"ended":false,"length":554,"gen_text":"Upon turning 21, the prices of products are reduced according to the amount of life you have left. You attempt to buy alcohol for your 21st tonight and the register reads 'CARD DENIED : ERROR 42 '.\n\nHowever, that only explains the sudden increase in rates. The average sales price for products is 20 per cent up from 13.1 per cent the previous year.\n\nThis time, a couple of people might think that it is a fluke. According to data from the Census and National Bureau of Economic Research, alcohol consumed in the second quarter of 2015 rose 3% compared to 5.4% a year earlier.\n\nHowever, we can be sure that the price of alcohol is now the largest variable in sales prices. As for the sales price of alcohol, it appears that the price of a gallon of beer or a bottle of wine has risen, making the overall price of the same product cheaper.\n\nAs the chart below shows, the price change during the first half of 2015 is slightly higher than the change during the year-ago period. This has likely been a consequence of the growing popularity of the 'tasty beer' brand, which has reached a market in which the average price for a gallon of beer was a few dollars less than average in the United States (around $10 for a pint!).\n\nThe price of beers in the second quarter also increased (5.6%). While there were no rises in retail sales, the market has been growing in ways that are no secret.\n\nAt the same time, over the two days ending on June 1, as many American teenagers went out for drinks, the number of adults binge drinking at least a little more often grew. During that same time period, the average alcohol consumption by a 21-year-old rose by 26 percent. On average, an adult consumed about a quarter of all their beverage consumption.\n\nThis isn't to say that the increasing popularity of the 'tasty beer' brand is solely down to American society. It's also interesting to consider that the price of beer in the second quarter of 2015 was about 25 per cent more expensive for American people.\n\nIn any event, the popularity of the brand has increased over the past few decades, with many young Americans now using more and more beer. The overall popularity of the brand, which is also seen in many other countries, has kept the trend going in recent year.

There is a scene in Dr. Mario Adventure where the giant horned cat's horn is used to defeat three opponents while Bowser is holding the hammer.\n\nIn Super Mario Paint Ultimate, the giant horned cat can use it for its attack to knock Luigi's Pok\u00e9mon out by hitting them with it.\n\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon, the giant horned cat can also be able to fire a sonic horn when using the Zipper to propel Mario (except when the song was written by Yoko Shimane ) into the air (as her song was inspired by the original song by Yoko Shimane from Mario).","token_len":595,"entropy":[6.0771,5.0779,7.7529,2.9922,2.3524,3.9458,0.0092,2.2117,2.1898,4.8426,2.4388,5.4926,6.5707,2.0807,1.6578,3.2498,4.0284,1.3357,0.4623,5.4614,1.3436,1.175,6.2213,1.731,1.4187,0.003,7.8804,3.6317,4.4704,1.9305,5.2885,0.0619,3.7212,2.5508,0.0234,0.039,0.8772,1.836,0.0774,0.0009,0.0001,3.6595,3.237,2.1482,2.0405,2.6815,1.2643,1.6749,4.1691,2.8288,1.502,4.7815,0.8743,2.7133,3.8843,4.5855,4.4691,5.3581,4.0743,2.2408,5.4105,0.1515,4.2916,4.7043,3.1098,3.9029,5.4898,1.2362,5.2274,2.9982,5.1925,1.4751,0.5771,4.7571,1.4682,1.8937,4.1194,0.654,0.9388,3.8534,4.2546,0.655,1.4506,0.739,4.4815,4.9284,3.8843,5.3625,0.0105,5.1836,0.4471,1.0699,0.0003,4.4942,0.742,0.0051,0.0009,0.0012,0.0159,0.0009,0.0057,0.0021,0.0026,0.0052,0.0019,0.0007,0.0015,0.001,0.0006,0.0024,0.0017,0.0014,0.0113,0.0019,0.01,0.0012,0.0227,0.0102,0.0034,0.0001,0.0014,0.0011,0.0019,0.0044,0.0028,0.0006,0.002,0.0006,0.0046,0.0006,0.0025,0.0023,0.0006,0.0015,0.0018,0.0013,0.0022,0.0011,0.002,0.0006,0.0021,0.0035,0.0006,2.9368,3.4609,2.3845,0.0233,0.1124,5.4546,4.9008,1.6431,4.7534,6.4625,1.454,0.803,3.4736,1.3253,4.5913,3.9703,2.5367,1.2895,3.3127,3.8011,5.2289,1.759,0.5609,4.1966,1.9355,0.8737,2.4873,0.8473,5.3658,3.2935,0.5037,1.7337,4.1715,3.1769,3.0261,4.0276,4.2508,2.3582,1.1655,0.7561,0.1805,3.8827,0.6646,0.6072,0.0002,3.3206,6.1417,0.3638,0.7412,1.2954,3.5808,0.6639,0.0029,0.0463,2.6872,2.5965,0.5747,1.2119,0.6596,2.3369,1.0085,5.6103,2.866,4.271,4.787,1.7844,1.258,0.0002,1.5908,1.5514,7.8241,0.0824,3.4464,4.8772,0.1567,2.3313,0.3969,0.9768,0.7064,0.0709,0.0003,0.0056,1.4127,0.8534,5.9049,3.1444,1.9628,5.3106,0.0285,3.3727,3.7076,4.998,1.7761,2.9367,2.2211,1.2561,5.7825,4.8465,0.2187,0.0965,3.5225,3.6894,3.8071,0.8573,0.7674,1.1664,5.6081,3.1065,1.5153,5.3345,3.0141,0.4222,0.0202,0.1564,4.7767,0.5778,0.0002,4.2533,0.0135,0.004,0.0014,0.0004,0.0005,0.0025,0.0735,0.0129,0.0008,0.002,0.0092,0.0009,0.0068,0.0042,0.0003,0.0027,0.0001,0.0018,0.001,10.1359,1.5163,3.5154,2.4356,1.624,3.068,4.6787,4.6567,1.457,5.2988,0.9612,1.1886,4.0953,4.8009,5.7783,5.1893,1.3552,6.1138,4.4331,1.8175,4.2665,5.128,0.2474,0.2229,4.9626,3.7312,1.2979,4.6544,3.4825,4.3493,4.0926,3.9571,3.6601,3.9041,2.9387,0.6148,1.7463,3.5022,6.276,3.2052,2.4419,4.8308,3.4982,3.3323,4.6071,5.8195,3.3134,1.2556,2.506,0.0654,1.5478,5.0462,1.2385,5.4555,1.3616,5.4651,2.9296,5.5256,0.7268,1.8231,1.4972,0.3796,4.243,2.0045,1.593,1.7456,3.2037,1.2856,2.3662,2.4803,2.0707,5.4058,2.2669,2.1509,5.7455,1.079,6.6318,5.2588,3.4585,1.6494,1.0368,1.395,0.0115,5.2983,0.038,2.8098,1.9099,5.1614,1.1673,3.4126,3.6583,3.3915,2.2705,0.1594,0.1299,5.4053,3.5086,0.3634,0.0121,0.0253,3.6135,1.219,1.0221,4.8848,0.7366,0.9523,0.0002,0.9571,5.1466,0.3618,0.0038,0.0004,0.0008,0.8768,3.8604,0.0104,0.0038,0.0042,0.0054,0.0342,0.0013,0.004,0.024,0.0074,0.0015,0.0009,0.0023,0.4244,0.1873,5.3249,0.0178,0.0029,0.0024,0.0004,0.0064,0.0017,0.0021,0.0032,0.0005,0.0021,0.0026,0.0009,0.0009,0.0033,0.0033,0.001,0.0023,0.0023,0.001,0.0017,0.0024,0.004,0.0084,0.0017,0.0014,0.0205,0.0657,0.0027,0.0035,0.0004,0.1014,0.0052,0.001,0.0044,0.0022,0.0017,0.0004,0.0459,0.0007,0.0025,0.0002,0.0043,0.0024,0.0004,0.0037,0.0244,0.0008,0.0039,0.0008,0.0008,0.0017,0.0012,0.0005,0.0023,0.0017,0.0003,0.0024,0.0204,0.0004,4.7088,1.0724,0.8961,3.2236,1.0494,6.0483,0.0891,0.8507,4.5057,0.6909,1.1561,0.8725,0.0534,0.0006,0.009,3.3708,1.5346,1.4036,2.2429,0.5084,4.1415,5.3291,4.0672,3.6423,5.655,1.6337,3.5668,1.6033,2.9199,0.4967,0.6992,0.0002,1.0686,1.8463,0.4,7.1786,5.5972,0.3373,0.6174,0.5086,0.0179,0.0006,0.0079,1.4455,3.2322,3.2027,3.8456,2.4859,2.205,3.6366,3.2622,5.5959,3.2487,5.9967,1.474,4.8411,4.012,1.259,0.4813,1.8013,0.4274,0.5039,0.0002,0.6949,3.7041,2.7777,0.3555,0.0426,0.1176,0.5384,0.3453,0.0167,0.0005,0.0042,0.8721,1.8629,0.616,7.7289,0.003,4.9936,1.0214,5.2346,4.4065,2.6241,3.2258,2.0274,5.8828,5.9658,3.6748,5.7661,4.897,4.9702,5.8041,1.6568,2.2726,5.6145,3.452,2.2106,0.9092,2.3768,0.0394,0.0189,0.0031,4.6014,2.4498,0.9231,0.0659,3.888,2.9856,6.1097,3.3722,2.0155,4.029,0.0381,1.2576,3.8165,1.3071,1.0855,2.8478,0.0201,0.0089,0.0015,3.5104,4.4379,4.5913]}
{"id":2552,"ended":true,"length":581,"gen_text":"`` Say something I'm giving up on you. '' Write around this quote - WITHOUT drawing inspiration from, or making reference to, the original context.\n\nSay something that I'm giving up on you. Say something that I'm giving up on you. Say something that I'm giving up on you. Say something that I'm giving up on you. Say something that I'm giving up on you. Now I'm ready to put a finger up your arse.\n\nWhen I'm giving up on you, my fingers are getting stretched out... or are being stretched out. So what if I'm giving up on you, but I'm never on you? It's hard to tell, with your fingers. Maybe I'm giving up on your shoulder? Or maybe you're still holding your arm while I pull away with my finger too? Maybe the wrist is tight, but it's really your forearm, your arm is holding your arm. As far as I can tell, you have your forearm, but it's so tight that the other arm comes loose and slips. I couldn't help but think about holding on to your elbow - as if I was holding on to you.\n\nAnd that's where you get stuck. Here's where the \"bad\" side of all this: I feel like giving up right now. Your fingers are feeling stretched out, or their forearm is getting stretched out. That arm is no longer holding on to your arm - that's just a feeling you're making. The two are becoming distant together. And that's where I get stuck. I can only sit and stare at you when you're smiling, if it's just my thumb. And that is where I get stuck.\n\nI feel I should ask your permission. I can't leave the room, I've already done I gave up on you! But my feeling is that I should call you off to go play on with something - just so that I can return it back to you. And if it can't be back, it may be back by any chance. My fingers would stay sore for a few minutes or not even feel like leaving. Don't lose any more of your fingers! Don't stop playing with them.\n\nBut even as you're not going to get back with your friends, try again. That is the question I ask myself constantly - if I just go on the world's most famous video. That I really want to go over this picture again. If she isn't with me, my finger is going to keep doing it for a while to let you know I want you. Do you really think I care about your back and your elbow, or care about our relationship? Do you even think that it's ever going to let me go back to the apartment?

{"id":2312,"ended":false,"length":550,"gen_text":"Write a seemingly straightforward comedy story that slowly and subtly becomes creepy and unnerving or downright horrifying, all while remaining under the guise of a light-hearted story.\n\nA comic that makes the viewer feel as if everything goes smoothly.\n\nThe audience is able to make up their own minds about how to enjoy the whole situation without giving up what it really means.\n\nThis is one that is not really about the movie or its director, but rather is actually about a man who has decided on his own, and where he wanted to go and it actually happens.\n\nHe tries to live his life in an imaginary world, which makes him feel like a monster, but he never knew that for certain, since he is a small-time comic book villain.\n\nIt is not unlike how a writer might write things out of small-talk, giving the audience something to talk about, without them knowing.\n\nThis is another one that feels about the viewer as they understand, and there is so much here about the ending, but it is so much more.\n\nIt is a good idea to start with a great story with really good character development.\n\nIt's just a few pages too long, but it is still worth having.\n\nThis is where the story might even be more interesting, because it also goes so long into the ending, that it will probably do more to put the story's plot in context, and provide the audience with a realistic understanding of the story at hand.\n\nIt would also provide the audience with characters who know what they are doing, without necessarily needing to get into specifics about them. And when you start to add in some depth, then you can introduce a bunch of characters you don't personally know and leave the audience with an entirely new perspective.\n\nThe movie doesn't really go into much detail of this plot, but it may give fans another piece of perspective on its plot that will fit into the narrative.\n\nIt almost feels like the movie is about one big show with lots of good characters, some good plot, and a really good ending, but ultimately that's not what makes it so great at all.\n\nI would say it is very important that any reader knows how to watch a movie about a movie, not just about the one you are reading.\n\nIt is all about the story, and how it can be appreciated and understood, but we need to pay attention to what really goes down to the end of it.\n\nIt is not enough, it is not enough.\n\nIt is not what it is.\n\nIf you are interested in reading this book on how good a story this thing can be, then I would strongly recommend it. It really helps a lot, all of these good things.\n\nWhen reading this book, you might want to read this: \" The Complete Guide to A-List Comics \" by Jim Butcher","token_len":595,"entropy":[4.0641,11.1689,3.9243,10.059,3.6441,2.6767,8.0368,3.6494,4.0415,5.0029,7.5494,1.7227,6.1616,0.0376,6.9202,5.9951,3.4844,1.9043,5.6467,1.8573,5.1369,6.0948,0.4283,5.2648,0.0465,1.4342,6.5332,3.0049,0.0108,2.2427,1.0388,1.3027,0.0066,3.8098,5.9429,2.4039,4.289,2.882,1.677,1.0828,2.5771,0.6736,4.1667,5.486,3.6974,1.8709,0.8812,0.0002,2.7359,5.4005,1.7044,4.1472,0.0063,4.0021,2.2459,0.2818,0.211,0.538,1.0922,3.1094,1.4648,4.1444,1.1341,4.6614,5.0491,2.6801,4.8324,1.0544,3.2217,3.8176,3.2635,0.7935,0.4854,0.5213,0.0002,2.8863,1.1456,2.5405,3.7905,2.5604,3.5298,4.7083,3.2103,1.6341,4.2032,3.2788,2.4156,3.9917,0.9129,0.6909,0.6358,4.3028,5.6696,0.3074,2.3971,3.3317,1.0441,2.4051,3.1977,5.3512,1.5789,0.47,3.2331,1.6288,5.6371,0.5287,5.8015,0.2039,0.4702,2.5825,5.4105,5.365,4.6606,0.8983,0.9794,0.0002,3.7181,5.2514,0.2981,3.8827,1.3312,0.1791,2.1155,3.0529,4.9867,0.2468,1.4983,3.3735,3.7769,1.0629,1.8273,1.1697,1.8424,4.2727,1.4557,1.3148,1.9902,3.7235,5.9677,1.6748,5.6061,3.2558,1.856,4.9036,0.5754,2.568,2.2628,5.3385,2.5167,0.9399,4.1788,0.7023,3.017,0.8745,0.6805,0.0002,3.3291,1.5143,2.799,5.6695,3.0282,2.2339,4.5838,2.9712,2.2704,6.6119,2.9528,1.5486,5.3792,1.4388,3.891,1.2584,6.2387,1.4149,1.8982,2.9072,0.4081,3.151,0.0393,1.5409,3.8613,4.6786,1.6036,2.6553,0.3927,0.0002,1.9627,0.7156,4.3717,2.4511,1.0353,4.1645,4.2619,1.6112,4.0324,1.912,3.5492,4.5421,3.9477,1.7545,5.2155,0.658,4.3305,0.1413,5.2618,2.8658,1.1329,5.9281,2.2348,2.1403,1.2541,1.0018,3.3389,2.1334,0.5435,1.9513,0.4592,0.0002,1.9345,0.7203,1.8637,4.1882,3.9477,0.6614,3.7834,1.1278,1.3292,5.0341,1.8674,2.8622,6.3337,1.3643,4.1013,0.6616,1.8127,0.4307,0.0002,2.2067,2.6341,4.2159,1.6503,4.9187,2.6646,4.7043,0.3204,0.9622,0.9435,1.2914,1.5195,2.499,3.582,4.966,0.9341,0.2943,0.0002,2.7043,0.6546,4.0767,1.383,2.7351,5.7243,5.2748,1.7045,2.6822,1.2513,1.4001,1.2981,0.965,4.6293,5.2982,4.1984,3.8642,2.5327,1.0571,4.2387,1.6364,1.9669,1.0537,4.6251,3.9861,5.6579,2.1539,1.6559,5.1845,1.1745,2.9658,4.4315,3.0126,1.7561,1.3848,1.8928,1.5328,5.2554,2.3259,1.2256,0.2693,1.0878,5.982,3.006,0.1708,1.0663,2.597,4.131,0.4825,0.1792,0.0886,0.0002,2.083,3.7536,1.4553,3.9704,1.5479,0.9065,0.1726,6.6027,1.0472,5.1872,2.1051,0.9183,0.4044,0.692,0.5688,4.0305,4.9441,4.3128,0.3102,4.6902,1.6288,4.5913,1.6889,1.587,0.5398,5.865,5.017,1.4143,3.3575,1.7641,4.4773,1.4852,2.0747,4.2851,1.2158,3.8715,1.4608,1.6867,5.2854,2.0436,4.6834,0.0744,1.8579,3.2061,1.9403,0.0004,7.3359,0.2968,2.6914,4.891,1.2659,1.5268,0.4891,2.8825,3.1534,0.8234,1.6027,1.0187,0.1033,0.0002,2.575,3.533,3.6509,0.0008,2.2402,3.7091,0.9053,1.7684,0.5939,4.3031,4.2411,3.2629,0.6209,0.912,0.9455,6.0643,2.9641,5.3115,5.2052,4.6631,0.1067,3.1859,1.4782,4.6955,2.3575,2.9666,2.3832,5.6932,2.0857,0.8096,3.682,1.0477,0.2362,0.0002,1.9969,6.6018,0.9451,0.1118,1.7919,1.5091,1.062,1.6791,4.0643,3.5129,5.4149,3.0704,3.5396,0.0439,4.1753,1.2297,0.8838,4.9163,2.3434,3.0625,0.7788,0.51,1.3613,4.1614,0.9237,0.6881,2.2069,1.0478,4.9021,3.7532,1.9039,1.3628,1.7669,2.7369,0.7246,2.914,1.1252,5.6221,0.1145,0.1,0.2102,0.0002,3.2125,2.6119,1.7474,2.1192,1.0902,3.9103,2.8078,1.8809,5.4571,4.4683,3.8824,2.2372,0.7845,2.4643,1.3627,1.3232,3.7152,1.0743,3.0504,1.3594,3.6613,0.2184,2.5843,1.6944,3.1357,2.6497,1.4846,2.1381,0.9236,0.3697,0.0002,2.3609,1.0385,4.4282,0.2993,1.304,1.8951,0.8161,0.8411,2.9789,1.105,3.7565,0.9977,5.8228,1.8904,2.2183,2.0923,2.6964,5.1753,2.1821,0.2365,4.9081,0.3597,0.1412,1.8695,3.7147,2.5748,3.8137,3.7322,1.332,2.3204,1.4664,2.7333,0.598,0.2291,0.0002,2.6209,0.9586,2.2182,4.0565,4.3464,2.9828,0.554,1.376,1.3162,1.3485,0.368,0.0002,2.2962,0.5904,1.387,3.6035,2.5893,0.9885,1.1682,0.2112,0.0002,2.8846,0.4905,1.6998,3.1749,0.0666,1.8136,2.1228,1.9531,4.4287,3.5979,5.5147,1.4625,1.1133,1.8399,7.2488,1.9809,0.084,0.2025,1.1872,2.2542,1.1167,3.5324,0.3277,2.0812,0.55,3.223,3.861,4.0438,4.237,0.2005,2.1474,6.8731,2.258,4.328,4.6025,0.9918,1.6826,0.3549,0.0003,5.6987,2.8467,0.8701,0.2026,0.4569,1.5536,3.3411,1.939,0.014,1.8674,2.3019,2.3794,4.65,6.5526,4.4226,1.8272,0.1015,4.1086,5.5514,2.2419,2.6628,1.0821,0.8269,4.6196,2.2656]}

A few of us have been here long enough.\n\nWe all know that the occupation of another land is our greatest victory. It has saved hundreds of millions of lives and brought them together.\n\nThe US has not done anything to stop the crimes that Israel has created and killed hundreds.\n\nIf Israel has not committed war crimes against Palestinians, then what is the difference in any of our lives? A peace treaty not to divide a people, not to divide the whole American society from your citizens. No war. Peace is meaningless.\n\nLet Israel decide how many of its own citizens (people ) will fight against it.\n\nIf Israel decides.

{"id":4295,"ended":false,"length":550,"gen_text":"Some time ago you wrote a short ghost story. Now, it's become an accepted truth and you've decided to come clean... your'ghost story was published by the British Journal of Paranormal Research.\n\nThe fact is that you have been involved in the matter since 2001.\n\nThe case in question is not a hoax, it's a case of mistaken identity\n\nIn 2003, you reported on UFOs and had a ghost story published by The New York Times.\n\nWhen you were a young lady, it became easy to talk to your neighbor or friend. The problem was you were told that your soul was missing. This fact caused a lot of anxiety for you because you had to hide with your ghost story.\n\nIn 2007, your boyfriend found out.\n\nMany more years of being afraid has resulted in your living in some creepy little town without lights, cameras and things to 'do'.\n\nAfter you were born, it was difficult to go to work until you had to go to school, so some of the other things.\n\nMany more years of not knowing any of the things that you want for your life have resulted in a life that you are really not ready to live.\n\nMany years of living in the worst condition imaginable after you came into this life which is so scary, you only feel good about your own survival.\n\nNow, there are other ghosts that are just as scary as those we are connected to.\n\nAnd in fact most people have never heard of them, and believe you that they will never be discovered like you will only become a living ghost.\n\nBecause you are not ready to believe it and can only go to sleep, you are so lonely. So this is why you are afraid.\n\nThere are hundreds of 'ghost stories' that I am telling that are not true, just like the one that you saw on TV. People think there is something beyond the paranormal, what you are after just does not exist.\n\nYou can actually hear the ghost's voice if you leave the living room or sit down under a car, it is your body. It's so terrifying when the voices of the people around you have been heard.\n\nI also heard about a 'ghost baby', a woman that you found lying in the backyard of your home in the year 2000. This woman can be heard being carried off with her baby to the hospital to die. The baby girl was found dead in July 2000.\n\nThese stories, like those you wrote about, are real people who are actually living. They were discovered by scientists, but only they found that there are really things that they can see through without our knowledge.

The idea would say: \"The day of Y-Day will come when we shall unite the human race and save mankind by taking the first step on our path to prosperity and security.\"\n\nMockjay Part 1, which was released in 2005, was supposed to be a Chinese \"one-man-one-vote mission\" for China to lead the world for the first time ever over the next two decades.\n\nMost people in China think of the one-vote mission as just an excuse for China to be aggressive in fighting terrorists; at present it is mostly aimed at deterring countries like the U.S. and Russia that have been allies with China.\n\nBut even as part of the one-vote mission, China is pushing for greater autonomy from all of the major nations for at least the next 20 years, the authors said.\n\nIn the book, many of the people in China are not aware of the Chinese plan. They're actually very happy it is a proposal for this nation to pursue.\n\n\"China is not a country who is on the verge of a complete meltdown, nor is it one whose leader has already announced the end to political strife, for fear of a U.S.-style regime-change effort under way on the part of the U.S.,\" the authors report. \"Not to speak of a military coup, of course, but no such thing.\"","token_len":596,"entropy":[9.1037,8.1918,2.1292,13.3593,1.7774,2.863,8.4269,3.4337,1.6396,6.7351,0.9977,8.065,1.1083,4.2882,3.2734,1.1342,2.2458,10.4386,3.1874,0.984,1.2426,0.0063,3.93,3.2272,0.0638,3.7411,1.5788,4.6572,1.9521,0.2431,1.9414,5.1906,0.452,4.062,4.63,2.1208,1.68,3.1253,2.3497,4.9607,1.6262,5.2566,5.9543,4.3407,3.4086,5.0579,1.915,0.332,4.2313,0.036,0.3136,1.3301,0.0002,2.5229,4.7086,6.3239,1.9271,3.0005,2.9693,2.8,4.611,0.0373,0.2881,0.4884,0.6963,0.5834,2.1721,2.5502,2.4812,3.2803,1.5413,5.4856,0.6911,0.9799,2.7977,2.9573,2.8726,0.9788,3.6796,2.81,5.6511,2.1105,3.9532,2.6968,0.848,0.5226,0.0002,2.144,4.8913,4.9304,1.1459,0.1262,2.4425,2.4591,3.9796,3.1899,3.4452,4.7102,0.4185,1.5812,0.6305,0.0773,1.4598,2.4986,2.8302,3.3058,0.3072,0.7893,0.0002,3.8369,4.7034,0.7117,0.004,0.2538,2.7323,2.2266,3.5394,5.765,3.3738,2.4384,1.0489,0.0002,4.3021,5.6761,0.0877,2.0845,0.1287,3.924,0.084,0.9068,2.8343,1.35,5.3877,0.526,5.2695,2.066,4.8217,3.3994,1.1669,0.0284,4.0746,3.9664,0.7404,0.3683,0.0002,4.3044,1.5671,1.5503,3.7699,0.2082,2.7619,1.502,2.7874,2.0238,0.1202,4.1592,0.7779,6.3309,2.1917,4.365,0.0319,5.2251,3.5594,3.1307,3.889,0.66,2.6632,0.6536,0.2987,0.0003,3.9496,1.1384,0.6193,3.2515,0.7395,3.6029,4.569,0.0055,0.4843,1.2325,5.1959,4.6813,0.9737,3.1116,1.2638,0.0895,5.9862,1.977,1.8554,5.9442,2.4103,1.3144,1.8587,2.0072,4.298,1.8639,2.1782,3.0014,0.1222,1.9619,1.728,0.3752,4.6579,6.7263,0.5608,3.8029,2.2612,0.0002,0.729,1.7394,6.8251,0.1451,0.0003,0.7581,0.3901,0.268,0.0002,5.2119,2.837,3.2656,1.9181,0.7873,1.7218,3.0626,4.3009,2.196,5.7699,0.9087,0.6133,5.7131,2.2494,2.1339,0.6237,5.5184,1.4332,0.1944,0.0002,5.766,2.4831,0.1661,2.8873,0.73,0.0562,3.3163,0.0049,4.035,1.5774,3.6569,0.5298,2.0607,2.893,0.6808,5.347,2.1201,1.3757,1.1479,3.7737,4.2253,0.0758,3.6247,3.7892,0.3384,1.2646,2.5564,0.0157,0.3458,1.2697,0.0025,0.0007,0.6039,0.3724,0.2535,2.2798,1.3304,0.0437,6.0937,0.1632,0.1487,0.0048,0.0107,0.0064,1.1589,0.0574,0.043,0.3173,0.0978,5.9379,0.1482,0.245,0.0002,5.7647,0.3544,0.0005,0.1125,0.0936,2.945,0.0002,5.2503,5.0861,1.6948,4.1214,2.9016,0.4857,4.583,3.5608,2.8543,3.775,4.7565,4.029,3.1997,2.4769,2.2306,5.4224,4.8287,1.6758,0.7706,2.1652,2.7124,2.5148,6.0937,4.5235,2.4996,1.34,0.3403,1.0727,3.4305,2.219,5.6333,2.1136,4.7719,0.0388,1.4529,3.5307,1.8325,5.4907,4.2947,1.8623,4.0387,0.4583,3.4445,3.5845,1.0097,0.7776,3.862,1.191,3.1689,0.5024,0.2127,0.0003,3.2374,4.3048,0.0881,0.2108,0.1391,3.1554,2.2285,1.387,3.6264,0.537,3.504,0.3602,1.4849,5.7356,0.0033,1.0213,1.1858,4.43,4.7626,5.3544,0.179,2.0584,3.563,0.3639,0.1995,1.6556,5.9545,0.6834,2.3905,2.6516,1.952,4.7343,0.8525,0.3306,4.8362,1.0655,2.2957,0.0206,3.7742,7.8697,0.3864,0.9352,2.9357,0.5603,0.2713,0.3325,0.0002,6.2777,2.445,2.1188,0.5979,3.3012,1.0068,1.3919,3.7641,0.091,4.2622,0.1085,0.1568,4.9915,3.153,2.7577,1.1752,2.3386,0.4398,2.9725,5.232,1.1544,4.4187,5.3257,6.0832,5.4731,5.0091,2.5446,0.8361,3.6019,3.9984,0.0565,4.8275,0.011,5.3177,1.0556,1.8137,1.8007,0.0007,0.0172,0.5757,1.1932,1.5464,3.0202,1.8651,1.9423,5.405,1.6914,1.0231,0.9093,0.134,0.0002,1.2097,4.835,3.5703,4.2047,0.0019,0.8106,0.8509,0.0085,0.1904,0.0947,0.1804,0.9419,1.5405,4.6701,1.3842,2.8858,3.4834,4.1452,4.2838,2.5124,1.0744,3.1534,4.6154,5.4102,5.4231,0.0082,1.413,0.1807,2.3454,0.0893,1.6033,3.2175,0.527,0.6706,0.0824,0.1229,0.0002,2.7069,1.5133,1.1224,0.1422,5.3765,0.7053,0.1653,3.3514,1.8291,0.9093,1.2944,3.9272,3.3014,0.5498,0.7007,5.3069,2.7655,1.6762,2.1798,4.221,5.5454,3.6764,3.3808,3.9377,1.73,3.9625,6.1351,3.3241,6.5128,4.1904,0.9255,5.2711,1.6361,0.1544,0.0002,1.2977,3.3818,1.212,2.3337,2.3795,2.2866,4.1266,1.9884,5.3288,0.6346,1.2248,0.0099,2.237,4.672,3.9344,2.1582,4.1934,0.6338,0.2276,3.4078,3.354,5.1471,2.0058,3.0228,4.5338,2.3924,1.6091,2.5599,5.5406,3.4763,2.5347,4.6033,2.7695,0.5773,2.9767,5.5631,0.0276,0.0553,1.6709,2.9028,5.694,4.8538,0.1712,4.8594,6.0374,1.8739,4.8748,0.8012,1.8679,0.0013,1.0082,1.2527,0.0014,0.0096,0.1625,0.6297,0.2201,7.975,0.0669,2.6338,5.7191,2.8923,4.7591,0.2162,1.5955,4.4392,1.4078,1.4543,2.3686,0.5658,0.9939,0.492,5.2319,2.9186,0.4194,1.6734]}

{"id":1109,"ended":false,"length":567,"gen_text":"An alien fanatic, ridiculed by many, finally discovers actual proof of extraterrestrial life on Earth. But instead of celebrating, he decides to hide the truth. Why? Why would he dare to do something so obvious? Why would he need to do it? And so on and so forth for a period of decades.\n\nWhile the Earth's atmosphere is not a perfect environment, humans possess an entirely different environment where most of our natural resources are produced. As scientists say the planet is not made of air and ground and cannot exist where life could ever exist. With this, we must make new efforts to live sustainably in our new environment (for better or worse).\n\nSo how can we sustainably manage this planet? We must work with our natural resources, resources which include our ability to support ourselves on a long enough basis. One example is a land bridge in Hawaii which makes some $13 billion per year, but it would make your life easier considering the amount of traffic we get on, and there are many jobs here and there to support you. Another example is building the tallest bridge in America in Hawaii which uses electricity for 75% of our electricity. A similar bridge would connect some 20 million people to one of the world's largest metros (we can connect to a whole planet using this, even if we did not live in it for so long ). Finally, we must find other areas of our society where our resources will make the world an even better place.\n\nEven though there are many benefits over a simple world, we need more people as they contribute to our community that can sustain us while maintaining our human needs. By making our food less harmful, our health services will increase, our happiness and our productivity would increase, and our happiness and productivity would increase for the long distance. Finally, while people can contribute to their community we must keep in mind that each person on this planet provides something that they are always able to provide to make that life happen. People on Earth should be allowed to be who they are and this is something we should all acknowledge!\n\nWe should start by asking why people are so eager to help us, ask what they can do for themselves and ask if something can even make it happen, especially if they make some small contributions to our needs. There are people out there working hard in our community who just want to help one another and give back to us. We can all join together on the world's most efficient growing community to spread the word.\n\nResources are everywhere. As a community we can create, grow and protect new resources to support the people who are needed most. The things we rely on for our daily lives are always there and never stops being there!\n\nThis article was prepared by my colleague Dave Smith.

The films have more people, even if they are mostly older people. As our society becomes more and more complex, it is very clear that less and less people will have the same ideas, and so the new people won't have the same ideas.\n\nFor people who were raised by their grandparents, we see the old ways as old stories. Our youth see the new ways as new stories.\n\n(I'm not claiming that all the things I've mentioned in the book are true, like some new invention, or even a recent discovery, but the changes that happen and the times they will occur change everyone's lives profoundly. I'm also not saying that these changes will slow some of the other things I've said, or that the changes in these changes will be good or bad for everyone\u2014I'm just saying that I don't really think so. But if you can see that these changes are the way things are, you'll see clearly, which will set you right, and will hopefully make your own world a better place.\n\nBut the changes don't just happen. There is a very short but fascinating period in the history of film, when that period ended. As the New York Review of Books wrote:\n\nIn recent decades, movies have been less popular than they've ever been before\u2014sometimes by as much as a third of a percent. When films went largely silent, but with an array of characters, they found support in the form of people who became movie stars. The most notable, in fact, was George L. Moore, who was so widely known as a director that he was almost credited with inventing the director's name. But when it was finally put to public by Paul Dergarabedian in 1982, nobody had taken it seriously. A few decades later, when the film made its debut in The New Criterion Collection (and became increasingly popular with the public), people remembered it as the one film that made a major splash. That movie certainly didn't turn out well, though. The only films that did turn out poorly were those of Stephen King (1984), the first of which opened in 1975, and with sequels, such as American Graffiti (1992) and The Last Man on Earth (2000), then returned for a second time in 1993 with American Hustle (2004) and The Muppets (2012).\n\nYou can read all about all of these changes in these essays by clicking HERE.

{"id":3076,"ended":false,"length":569,"gen_text":"When a parent dies, their knowledge and skills immediately pass on to their eldest child. An adoptee is shocked at what they discover when they receive their inheritance without warning.\n\nHowever, when they finally get to live their natural lives, we realize how deeply held our loved ones have been for us. We never get to see their faces again in our lives, as we are forever reminded that life is about our ability to make our own choices.\n\nThe question is, are our memories and aspirations sufficient for us to live our lives free of danger and disappointment? Are we actually willing? Or do we have to pay attention to what's happening daily in the world?\n\nSo how can we learn to manage fear in our children?\n\nHere is the key: we want our children to love us. We want to see more beautiful things in our lives. But our love makes our relationships with our own children so difficult and heartbreaking when we neglect to take a big step forward.\n\nI have never found myself in bed with my son, who has been so much more important for me than any other person. I couldn't help but laugh at him when he said that I should have never had a relationship with him. But he has shown that he is very loving, caring, and thoughtful, and even takes great care to explain every word he says in great detail. He may talk about love as a \"magic potion\", but it really is an amazing way to communicate something that we haven't learned yet. It makes perfect sense because we could never live as they did. That's why it takes us a lot to come out of hiding and become more open to the truth; it's because we have no way to stop taking it for granted.\n\nWe need to take responsibility for our actions at the beginning; we need to have the ability to understand that I am what I am not and that I'm allowed to live my life with integrity. And those are the basic things I should remember about being a child.\n\nI am so grateful for the children I have put through their best years for me. They have been so devoted; they taught me not to fall for self-promotion and the big \"let's move on and see what's happening.\" So they are even more caring, kind, and open in giving. The fact that I continue to tell these things is also important; and I think that being open doesn't hurt me to ever speak to others about my life issues more than I already do.\n\nSo with this, my wife and I are taking a real hard look into how we can begin to nurture the children that our families will be so proud of when they grow up, how to care for families who need my support when we are not always here for them.\n\nSo, I invite you to join us in asking for your support.\n\nThank you for listening,\n\nKathryn.J","token_len":598,"entropy":[3.591,6.2961,4.9431,0.6684,3.0436,7.3892,2.5692,2.7044,7.2091,5.5875,3.1314,0.3083,0.7495,8.4279,0.8937,0.5233,5.8718,9.1643,0.1133,0.0007,2.8155,9.4824,2.4979,2.5946,1.6968,3.8531,2.2094,0.7914,5.329,2.187,5.8963,6.6017,5.9074,0.4584,1.4341,0.0013,5.4009,0.0483,3.1559,2.2994,4.3277,2.4518,1.5171,4.3775,2.8174,5.8972,0.9189,0.4086,6.1278,4.6581,2.8682,4.2497,4.1166,1.283,4.7599,0.1505,2.3031,1.3557,3.4169,1.9017,0.6019,1.9203,5.1595,3.9591,0.9482,1.2308,2.0677,1.9919,2.554,4.3854,2.2355,1.1972,1.3753,3.7641,1.475,2.4014,3.9399,3.0588,1.4754,4.6751,0.6638,2.5996,3.2819,5.6541,0.0343,3.2652,3.2828,0.908,0.9509,0.8015,0.8974,0.0001,3.0656,6.011,1.3944,0.9528,3.6877,2.4365,4.8676,3.241,5.7183,5.1229,1.7904,1.057,0.1168,1.9657,2.1254,0.76,5.8091,0.5913,5.7553,1.3946,4.4135,0.2087,2.9272,0.806,5.257,3.2732,5.9692,3.0315,2.3083,0.1683,2.4909,1.2877,4.4364,3.0849,0.4143,1.653,2.2184,0.9541,5.5406,1.663,2.2963,0.455,1.2779,0.5709,0.0001,4.987,2.2124,1.7797,0.1893,3.637,0.5291,5.0369,4.0853,2.3581,0.3577,3.328,0.7943,1.1103,0.0001,4.2375,2.4596,2.2563,3.1228,2.2609,3.2013,4.4806,1.9937,0.365,0.0702,5.4751,1.1843,2.033,1.1815,0.2877,1.2954,3.7614,6.4228,4.8296,1.051,0.9922,1.4748,0.4181,0.7807,3.8347,3.6025,3.0028,6.2275,2.6326,4.7226,1.4865,0.5523,4.6469,0.3606,2.5733,2.1532,2.3479,5.0211,4.5611,1.0959,4.9433,2.1704,3.3444,3.0735,5.6982,0.4373,1.0093,0.71,0.2802,0.0001,4.0572,2.7726,4.0027,3.8026,2.0471,1.5908,7.4715,1.1557,1.2209,3.2508,2.2586,2.2249,2.4559,1.9029,2.9054,2.9834,0.7482,4.6378,3.6715,0.3675,0.5884,2.1224,1.0298,1.8616,1.6023,1.5176,5.6706,0.0008,2.5551,0.1952,4.8532,1.6062,1.6487,1.2265,0.733,2.3471,2.1271,1.9714,2.7483,2.2745,3.7373,2.6568,2.0872,2.7691,0.1446,0.2925,0.6343,2.8139,2.3953,2.6385,4.1468,2.3909,0.689,1.3109,3.78,3.8402,1.6378,2.6962,0.5422,0.5646,4.0939,1.849,0.5269,4.2296,4.859,3.2732,1.3546,0.9697,4.5047,5.1512,2.6499,1.5382,0.2067,2.7968,5.3722,0.0316,0.8748,2.1448,6.0516,5.7529,0.4234,3.8484,3.7397,1.5755,3.6621,4.9954,2.6502,2.0616,0.3278,2.5452,2.3826,0.9158,3.3839,2.6521,3.138,0.2406,4.3798,5.4429,1.7787,2.2418,4.3952,0.0004,4.4001,1.7736,0.2125,3.8462,2.8724,5.8314,0.0088,3.9079,1.7076,5.8298,2.7084,4.985,4.7364,5.7552,1.6892,1.1152,5.663,1.0372,0.8408,2.7205,3.8036,3.371,2.6269,2.1183,2.1918,5.0206,4.1397,0.7908,2.9658,1.7347,3.7735,2.8802,1.5152,0.9987,2.1567,3.6269,6.1939,2.06,1.1058,2.2905,0.6648,2.3981,3.2075,2.8715,0.7706,3.5853,5.6439,3.6272,2.2724,0.0061,0.3579,0.2291,0.0002,2.792,1.9039,0.237,3.1577,2.8531,0.2447,0.611,2.3321,5.8934,1.9256,3.7156,4.6924,1.1405,0.2199,0.0492,4.7543,2.2891,3.5547,0.0237,4.7229,2.0289,6.046,1.2115,4.5751,0.2465,0.3702,2.9513,2.2532,1.1481,0.9454,3.1466,5.5608,0.1032,3.3327,0.9897,0.1835,2.4756,2.6756,1.0842,2.9651,5.8958,1.6636,0.6982,5.0341,2.0995,2.9231,4.93,5.1253,1.8316,2.6735,0.5216,3.1116,0.794,0.5415,0.0002,2.3881,2.3583,3.504,1.0041,1.1463,1.3953,5.4325,0.9868,0.4941,5.6852,1.0217,4.4451,4.4922,0.6655,5.3319,1.4393,0.927,2.3521,1.1397,2.0347,1.521,5.5395,6.1206,0.7826,5.3661,0.0355,4.4986,0.0504,4.5459,1.482,5.5628,0.062,1.6624,0.1807,1.4029,4.3665,5.2237,4.2615,5.3119,0.3239,4.5494,0.285,4.0224,1.7944,0.8652,2.6365,3.7884,3.0373,5.2928,2.3472,2.4889,5.4296,0.8084,5.1446,1.6111,2.4041,0.2507,0.3591,3.6772,3.6078,3.5167,2.1551,4.1741,3.0994,0.1968,1.5438,6.0018,0.0418,5.2571,3.6968,3.8133,2.2393,4.9199,3.5014,2.2928,4.0749,1.5512,2.9934,1.4414,4.7746,2.5738,5.9629,0.0006,3.5745,3.6974,2.9844,5.2318,5.096,3.7266,3.2069,0.5545,1.9899,2.2578,5.1805,4.5273,1.9676,1.1517,2.9601,0.9449,0.2255,0.4985,0.0002,3.121,5.1335,2.3828,2.8309,3.4392,3.9746,0.6627,0.052,1.6706,3.93,1.7241,5.2185,2.6112,0.0772,4.2531,2.0908,0.655,1.0956,5.2275,0.2003,4.8812,2.37,3.6119,2.3661,3.2948,2.5922,1.8987,1.9803,2.5836,0.8061,0.4063,4.3522,0.8321,1.155,0.1021,2.9729,4.2309,1.3971,4.5383,0.052,7.5179,2.6328,3.1617,6.3032,1.2823,3.4036,1.6349,2.0644,3.2082,5.2456,5.5593,2.0265,0.2193,0.9752,0.6942,0.0002,3.7233,2.0783,2.5283,4.1374,0.1213,0.1264,1.1309,1.341,1.1598,3.6774,1.5137,1.6936,1.5812,1.3336,1.6527,0.0002,2.9827,0.016,1.2501,2.8662,2.2733,1.0297,0.0001,4.2339,2.3751,1.061,3.3909,6.3613]}

{"id":236,"ended":true,"length":578,"gen_text":"Every time you feel pain, it never goes away and simply builds up. So if you stubbed your toe, it would stay stubbed. What is the world like?\n\nJust one short example of this:\n\n\nIt goes without saying that most people who have serious psychological challenges cannot have any difficulty in dealing with the stress induced by a disability. This is a hard truth because mental health is such an important condition that it is almost without parallel. Our body and mind have to work together to overcome it and most of all it must work to cope with the stress.\n\n\nThis is not to say that being a member of the disabled community is not difficult. To the extent that I am aware I have had some major difficulties with my work with disability. A few of which include:\n\n\nI had no mental health diagnosis, mental distress disorder or any disability that would disqualify me from any sort of employment. In recent years I have found some jobs that help me with my mental health and are not stressful at all. However, the experience has led me to believe some of the roles that I have in my day-to-day lives are not really of a high priority for me. I've had to deal with the stress through my life, but there were no jobs or benefits where the burden of working for the disability group was much greater than working on the community. While there are other areas of my life where I have been able to go about my business without being too stressed I would do the same at any of my other jobs, even at the end of any day of my life.\n\nAfter this one I will only be making my living doing something that is absolutely essential if we are going to save the planet. In light of what I have personally experienced in this experience, my work at my own company, which is in the process of being laid off, is highly appreciated! Although my experience shows that even for young people with disabilities the time spent with the disability groups will not be what it once was, there will be people who can provide the support that the communities of my life can provide. My hope is that this experience will lead some young people who are on an extended disability group to the acceptance of the new workplace that is happening in North America.\n\nThis has been something that comes as a bit of relief to many. As has been one of the things I have had to overcome over the last few years has been realizing that it is very important to support people with disabilities over the course of their lives. As it is quite clear that this is not some sort of work for everyone, however, that many people must rely on friends and family who will support them. It is very important that I understand how our society views the disability issue and that it is always important for people with disabilities to contribute to the understanding that there is much to be done and that this will not be the life-size job that some are aiming for.","token_len":598,"entropy":[5.307,1.5318,5.1072,5.6531,0.5501,2.482,6.5892,2.5579,0.0074,3.9085,8.1313,6.7063,0.9892,1.8654,3.8495,2.7107,0.4072,12.3378,3.2506,0.526,0.04,1.3843,1.9208,3.4015,5.3352,7.6961,0.6248,1.5556,5.9814,2.7845,1.6904,7.7885,1.4081,2.8981,1.5932,0.0145,5.7463,3.9527,5.7283,3.4222,1.6475,1.7038,2.47,4.9906,0.0003,4.0295,5.3138,1.0963,0.0017,0.2236,4.779,1.3074,2.4501,1.9144,5.8035,5.3622,6.2937,5.0572,4.4519,2.0141,4.9396,2.1738,3.4666,0.004,2.3304,2.7351,6.2384,0.0805,2.4832,5.6631,0.4658,3.2089,0.6294,2.632,5.8111,2.2267,3.2231,4.816,0.7254,1.6509,3.6007,1.7677,0.5921,5.1459,2.0691,1.5076,0.6813,3.4586,6.7725,3.0366,1.6595,5.437,3.9224,3.2449,0.9487,2.9177,1.9727,1.9766,1.3533,0.4477,2.5953,2.62,2.1826,5.5603,1.0773,1.4864,2.2543,2.2653,1.9959,2.1882,3.22,0.1557,1.1848,1.6429,1.6843,3.1282,0.0004,3.1924,0.7982,2.5738,0.9101,0.102,0.1682,5.1142,2.1807,5.8309,0.0204,0.9744,0.8961,1.0677,0.8956,1.7452,3.6437,0.7829,5.6612,2.5937,1.5872,0.1567,3.812,1.5913,3.1929,3.2628,1.0179,1.7613,1.8549,5.387,2.089,1.4915,0.7184,4.5667,3.7892,1.9124,1.5862,4.7999,1.8218,2.1965,4.8925,4.8633,1.9403,1.3884,0.0003,1.63,3.0416,3.9746,5.0521,0.4666,5.2419,2.9732,5.3839,5.0871,1.6812,1.3072,2.1376,4.6439,2.6978,2.193,5.4008,0.0023,0.0876,0.3745,4.2583,3.1207,0.0004,1.4701,0.7986,3.8677,7.035,0.2394,0.6203,0.2757,3.9622,4.3911,4.1322,1.158,5.6548,0.8168,2.3635,0.8081,1.7421,0.1956,2.0474,3.8614,3.0061,5.2817,3.1948,0.0162,0.2404,2.9167,0.3581,3.2338,4.63,1.3098,3.3964,0.0982,0.0332,1.7255,6.1005,1.0688,0.8829,5.0595,1.5519,1.4081,1.3231,3.6522,0.9479,4.5163,0.4918,0.0039,0.0004,0.0004,2.8158,0.9371,1.3136,3.9599,5.4464,2.8265,1.4131,1.8768,1.8092,0.0978,0.5364,1.84,4.0589,2.0519,1.066,2.5644,0.024,2.5024,2.4725,5.6284,2.1512,4.4409,1.7428,2.1644,3.726,4.4301,2.4057,1.9059,2.0846,2.2998,4.545,4.04,4.3796,0.6851,4.1041,2.3266,2.1814,1.9786,4.0567,0.861,3.7431,1.6507,0.6937,4.3675,3.2648,2.1361,5.79,1.6582,5.481,2.7239,1.0938,3.9409,4.4043,0.984,0.4277,0.0589,0.7186,0.4594,1.3204,2.3015,1.6988,0.0016,4.7494,1.6283,0.1846,3.2299,2.2679,2.734,5.0848,1.0783,3.5545,3.4661,4.5678,3.9986,0.2157,4.8157,1.6955,3.4846,1.9824,0.4832,1.3262,2.3161,3.633,3.3994,1.8081,3.0636,0.0589,5.7037,2.6618,2.41,0.6653,0.5886,0.253,2.1191,0.0002,5.6995,4.7796,5.5373,2.2928,5.4763,4.6162,2.1655,4.9642,3.0532,1.7122,2.8251,2.9357,1.1809,1.706,4.6414,1.0621,5.9857,3.5687,0.3621,0.8223,0.0295,4.7952,0.9518,1.0937,0.6797,3.9637,5.6955,0.0023,2.9614,0.8271,0.6633,6.7548,0.5718,2.6804,2.9896,4.2077,1.056,3.8908,4.451,4.2859,3.562,2.8242,2.0043,2.6626,3.3561,1.3321,3.499,1.2143,1.8768,0.0035,1.1686,5.348,0.0299,0.5889,1.2591,5.3197,4.0801,5.1785,5.8463,2.9353,2.5968,5.3851,0.4452,4.9885,3.9683,5.8616,0.3636,1.8112,1.3454,2.7728,4.9052,2.5862,2.1787,1.6292,0.8488,3.9873,4.2195,1.8753,0.655,5.0511,0.4653,1.1001,0.0485,0.4823,3.1271,1.8512,1.1327,3.3457,0.6791,3.6117,4.0752,2.4115,1.1611,1.809,3.3036,6.4681,2.6356,2.5854,4.7673,3.1148,0.4806,0.7118,4.3614,2.7936,0.1784,0.0816,2.1432,2.1579,0.4843,2.7953,3.8487,2.077,0.1196,2.1996,1.0947,4.9885,4.1316,3.5381,1.3955,1.1049,0.6468,4.6983,4.5041,1.2266,1.5717,5.6374,5.4347,2.3097,1.3489,3.9162,1.511,5.9188,0.1092,0.7339,0.9527,0.0002,3.6238,4.1082,0.8068,4.0624,0.8442,6.2545,2.0232,0.6087,3.8815,0.0296,2.5524,0.4296,2.0864,2.3567,3.4582,6.67,0.3538,6.3594,0.3633,0.5445,3.2059,1.193,0.7085,3.2785,0.4678,3.3877,2.2707,0.0891,1.6668,1.0825,0.1737,3.6422,0.1179,5.9197,0.1717,3.22,0.3522,2.8796,2.32,0.5925,4.1125,1.5038,1.4723,0.616,6.6414,0.9815,3.3026,0.0008,0.3666,0.3041,0.4601,3.3342,3.7029,1.4317,5.9448,2.5248,1.1117,2.9811,0.8509,0.8097,5.5137,2.3603,0.0013,5.6118,2.6808,3.9012,0.7466,5.2191,1.1569,4.4993,3.7702,1.0878,6.1687,4.6854,0.1824,5.5307,0.7694,0.2884,2.4713,2.0931,2.9201,0.306,1.6415,2.6667,0.4631,2.9018,0.3568,0.9789,2.9263,4.462,2.6019,5.6582,1.2122,3.6896,2.6519,1.8062,2.8748,0.7353,2.7892,2.104,0.6651,4.8027,1.9759,1.116,1.252,0.9827,0.2598,0.1396,4.8104,0.5924,1.0917,4.8102,1.7901,2.5665,0.6494,3.9019,1.5666,0.6395,0.81,2.4003,0.8686,3.3031,3.3488,1.5966,0.7981,2.2281,6.3841,2.3734,4.863,3.163,0.6991,1.807,3.8428,5.0981,0.1673,0.2732]}
{"id":1612,"ended":false,"length":565,"gen_text":"A squad of US marines must slay a dragon... and one that has the power to kill people on sight. Or at least, kill people on sight... But let me tell you something.\n\nWhen you have a dragon that attacks your target but doesn't die, you can make it go right or left before it ends its attack. This works for any type of attack that takes place in this game, unlike the other dragons. The Dragon is the creature that turns the fight against it into a battle of attrition. If you're a fan favorite I know why I love this game, since it is a unique challenge. A dragon attack that kills any one of you by attacking with any kind of weapon is a deadly attack. Even with the most effective abilities this allows for an easy counter. There are also the dragon's own special ability, 'Lights out, Darken' which allows you to turn off light weapons based on whether some of the other powers are active. This makes this a bit easier than you might think. A dragon attacking from within is a lot like killing from within.\n\nAnd finally, if you were looking for a Dragon based game, this one might be the right choice! There will be a great deal of detail there on these pages as well as a fantastic variety of options, so don't worry if I don't cover all of the areas at once!\n\nHere are a few of game information, from game design to performance. What games would you recommend?\n\nThis Is A Game It Needs to Get Harder - The End of a Dragon by John Scalzi\n\nThe End of a Dragon\n\nWii U is my favourite RPG, so I have very little problem with that. I didn't even know the game was being developed for my PS4, so I was thrilled for this one. I found I could almost sit back and enjoy it for hours, and with lots of options. And this is just good for the fact that I could have used a game, right? Right until the one I played on the PS4 where it did turn the tide. This game could have easily broken any genre, but this one is one of my absolute favourite JRPGs and I'd highly recommend it.\n\nWii U 2.2 on the PS4 - Game Quality and Great Graphics\n\nIn my opinion this is a great game. I really enjoyed how it turned out. I would say a high level of detail to this game is the best I've ever seen it. The action was good, and the story was well executed. I just have to say this game really got my juices going all fast.\n\nSo, What Would You Recommend?\n\nThere are many games on this list, not the most popular, but they are all great games. The only question is will they ever make a better one for my money, or if the game will simply stay the same like I mentioned before?","token_len":599,"entropy":[10.2946,0.7047,5.2931,2.7909,7.6313,8.8743,1.6548,5.3717,6.5927,2.2302,4.919,4.8262,2.6678,3.0964,0.9118,0.0874,2.9459,3.7444,4.4303,2.1343,0.5759,5.5027,2.3498,0.0328,1.6887,2.5108,1.7589,1.5299,1.1378,3.1287,5.1379,5.8971,3.3934,0.9596,0.0204,1.447,1.2572,2.4657,0.063,4.1931,1.8671,4.0487,2.0082,1.9572,2.4643,4.726,2.7756,3.1618,6.013,2.0726,0.0009,3.7873,0.4767,1.1023,1.327,4.4272,2.0135,3.7896,4.9693,5.7958,0.2251,5.1696,1.1296,5.1855,2.3207,1.8548,0.4226,2.6762,3.331,1.9546,2.0445,2.9305,0.0143,2.73,2.343,4.2211,0.5749,1.5306,4.7401,1.6649,1.1324,6.4811,1.9475,2.6326,3.7696,1.1074,2.7855,3.2087,3.1938,2.894,4.7165,0.5734,5.5157,2.1403,4.8798,2.8418,3.5276,0.9068,0.4136,2.1149,2.0294,1.3348,0.5881,2.8947,0.7651,2.7594,2.8976,3.7673,6.447,5.5374,3.6614,3.7,3.8771,1.4944,1.2152,0.7187,1.9602,5.4153,0.8474,2.5216,2.0494,4.8269,5.1094,2.0884,4.8514,1.5351,3.9495,2.5871,2.5131,5.113,4.2188,0.8698,2.7976,5.9777,4.1601,2.7647,4.7861,2.7069,0.0079,1.2868,1.7229,1.5065,5.5437,2.9407,0.87,4.6553,3.3858,1.5372,4.4195,5.6856,5.6371,5.147,5.4431,1.7835,3.1692,3.2753,4.9468,2.0649,4.6018,0.6105,3.0661,3.7772,4.3267,2.1406,3.1467,1.3976,3.3302,1.4245,4.9352,5.2309,4.2885,2.1901,4.6847,4.8055,3.7221,2.7604,0.7206,2.063,0.6554,0.0314,3.0612,3.7093,4.1245,6.43,6.6413,0.1174,3.7137,8.7084,1.2064,0.8805,2.424,4.7895,1.2598,1.5819,0.644,2.7168,2.7748,1.8871,1.5701,5.3091,3.6491,2.5106,2.2206,0.3347,0.2071,0.461,4.6756,1.085,4.9369,4.4147,3.2842,1.864,1.6047,3.7641,2.5654,4.1605,3.5651,1.3488,1.3765,1.3723,0.0002,4.3917,3.5235,0.3175,3.5209,0.285,5.0011,2.6825,0.1734,0.8288,3.4868,5.4848,1.3102,1.1284,1.7262,2.2626,2.9853,0.7727,2.0678,5.3635,1.496,3.4873,3.7465,3.9737,0.2523,1.7831,4.7845,1.5825,0.1663,5.1276,4.8853,3.1875,5.0905,0.9702,2.9128,0.5654,1.1474,1.8024,4.8938,5.1932,0.0303,3.847,3.0066,1.8323,3.6568,0.0004,3.5746,0.6243,3.7533,1.4391,0.0003,2.2142,1.7517,0.7458,1.9161,4.8658,5.561,0.6674,2.1825,0.8896,0.0002,4.6615,1.1505,1.8701,0.2917,1.7789,8.8396,5.2475,3.5094,4.4962,4.8987,3.0246,0.749,5.9352,1.4463,5.8866,4.2313,3.673,0.156,1.0737,1.2536,0.8117,0.0003,3.8561,6.7935,1.7412,1.4096,5.4793,4.2473,1.7691,5.1493,4.4009,0.5125,4.734,2.7865,5.8995,1.0127,3.5792,2.9962,4.5348,4.3011,3.8084,0.0002,0.912,0.0003,2.7195,1.2747,0.0415,0.1372,0.0282,3.5447,0.0003,5.7706,3.9251,0.7861,4.8469,4.5468,3.1356,4.6718,2.14,2.2382,0.9563,3.2369,5.3396,0.8963,3.7433,0.7378,3.456,0.6627,2.1153,5.3575,0.0009,1.9171,1.6952,2.7654,1.822,0.6988,3.6803,1.305,2.2555,2.3765,3.8494,0.9048,1.4357,0.8124,0.6665,2.4083,4.5046,4.5687,1.819,1.2302,0.3098,2.1748,4.4474,5.3907,1.4797,5.4544,5.55,1.5533,0.1251,0.5976,1.3541,3.4233,1.7357,2.0531,1.9489,4.6274,5.3206,0.0428,3.9054,1.6412,4.252,3.5278,1.1549,2.422,5.5986,2.7502,2.1368,4.674,0.3184,1.9011,2.5957,3.6828,3.8835,1.7101,4.1806,5.5766,3.9761,0.1641,5.08,7.065,1.3643,6.6271,1.303,3.5113,3.6101,1.6869,1.1462,0.3154,4.9299,1.3989,5.0662,4.5687,3.1774,1.9948,1.7009,3.2985,0.937,4.8137,0.7412,1.8473,5.4625,3.5806,4.5869,2.1779,1.0763,2.2867,0.5542,1.7684,3.4415,0.699,1.7066,3.0346,1.0611,5.514,0.0017,0.1136,3.4289,1.4656,3.8089,3.139,0.0335,0.3736,0.8959,0.5754,0.0002,3.9585,0.0676,0.0804,5.5666,1.1201,4.2445,5.2683,2.2459,1.7048,0.1961,1.2973,3.1025,4.8261,2.0803,5.5437,2.8926,0.6821,0.0003,4.7615,1.99,0.4887,1.8635,0.9267,1.6371,2.1072,0.505,1.3878,2.0453,3.6699,1.3854,3.8804,1.5093,2.5665,0.0603,1.0058,1.8119,3.5017,2.2051,3.9546,5.7867,2.7943,0.5391,1.9816,4.729,1.9875,0.5063,1.6616,3.3351,1.6663,1.2158,0.2679,1.0678,0.4399,3.8728,1.1144,1.5636,5.4477,3.1237,3.9759,0.9444,1.6226,0.9095,3.1965,0.6651,2.5184,4.1357,0.285,1.9004,4.3069,4.3412,0.3448,0.6283,2.6506,1.0699,3.8732,4.1075,3.1726,3.52,1.9131,5.5567,5.1865,0.5837,1.8081,0.0002,5.252,1.9354,4.6988,3.3309,0.392,2.2308,0.6196,0.2705,0.0003,4.164,0.3639,2.0705,2.5255,2.8214,0.632,0.0325,1.4326,5.1647,3.4426,2.7503,1.0183,1.2932,0.2443,2.7386,1.3106,0.848,1.7076,2.0882,0.7946,2.5335,2.2888,3.7517,0.7437,3.568,1.5366,1.7094,2.8071,3.0234,5.6025,1.8621,3.2104,3.0971,2.7457,2.0848,1.3884,2.9442,3.4028,2.3391,1.1156,5.0014,3.7101,1.7456,0.0996,5.6301,2.6859,5.2395,1.6528,0.8098]}

A DVD is already in the player and when you enter, you find the previous owner is there and needs your help to finish the plot.\n\n. A DVD is already in the player and when you enter, you find the previous owner is there and needs your help to finish the. You discover that the DVD in the Player's list may be a complete scam but you can click the first button to receive confirmation that it is coming and when the DVD is inserted go back, and the DVD will have come out of the Player's list.\n\n\nThis happens for many reason and has been repeated multiple times so if you have questions feel free to call and I will explain it.\n\nThe key to the movie is to pay the price of a DVD for your DVD player. This is what a price is like with DVD players like Roku and Amazon which makes it easier but also an easy way for people to make your DVD player work and is generally cheaper.\n\n\nI have never found this work but have now taken my 5 year old Roku box out front for a few days and made it work!\n\n\nIt also helps that when you plug in your Roku it will just say \"Playback\" so that you know your DVD is not working.\n\n\nIf the DVD Player is not working and your internet connection is bad (such as having the camera off then your internet connection is blocked and you just watch the DVD without the camera on) I found that my internet connected friends had a few problems in their local computer. The video game they had to play was played on the Roku but it did not work at all and my internet connection was the bad part. So after my internet went down I left my computer and bought another Roku so I could play this game but my internet speed was fine. The DVD player in the Movie was supposed to be working and that didn't work, just an error in playing a movie on my local connection so I bought the latest DVD players I could. The problem was that the player's \"Playback\" message was going off and my network internet went down. The problem went away when I had to log in after the DVD Player stopped working.\n\n\nI decided to try and purchase a second hand media player. The only problem was that you have to pay for the DVD player. The price for the cable is about the same so now I just bought the cheapest of a decent cable that comes with it but I am now really unsure if it works or not. I'm sure if it does eventually, it will.
