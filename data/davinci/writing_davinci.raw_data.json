        "Aliens visit earth and are fascinated by other animals but find humans completely unremarkable. Hello, let me begin this report by stating just how thankful I am to have been sent to Earth. It was truly an eye opening experience and without your guidance and funding would have been utterly impossible. Let me give you an overview of how Earth functions, and I think you will be surprised to find that it works very similar to our planet. There exists a large number of organisms going through one stage or another of change while they fall into their respective places on the planet. The conclusion of my research has confirmed what we have believed to be a universal law called net impact theory, which can be described in two parts: 1. a species can only exist if it has a net positive impact on its environment. 2. Species' which detract from their environment will go extinct. My research will hopefully continue to discredit the theory which this universal law replaced - survival of the fittest. Earth has many",

Sitting across from her I had one of those moments. Not one of our dreams. Our dreams had more lasers and robots and sometimes a t-rex. But still not real. \"You look like you do in the dream\" \"Did you expect me not to?\" \"I didn't think you were real\" I didn't think she was real either, but I felt like I shouldn't say that. One of those double standard things. \"So what now?\" Good question. What do you do?

Wibble WIBBLE! * \"Okay! Get off my back, jeez.\" Spoke the cultist, now walking to the nearby village. This village had been accepting of the new colonists, but the cultist wanted to wait for the village population to increase ten percent, whereas the angry jar wanted to convert the village now. \"Hello villagers! I bring gifts of exotic fruits, and the beliefs of my people!\" spoke the cultist to the small crowd. \"This jar is part of our beliefs.

The last thing I remember was walking home after last night. I had just left the bar, as I was celebrating my 21st birthday a week late with my friends, and I was crossing the street. I am in my old bedroom, so I must have gone to my mom's house, given that is is closer to the bar than my own house. I sit up in bed, and my room looks different. I look down at my arm, and it is in a cast. The last time I was in a cast was when I fell out of a tree on my fourth birthday. I look around my room. On a shelf in the corner are a row of cards. \"You're Four!\" one reads. \"Happy Birthday, Superhero\" another one decorated with images of Spiderman says.

What do you do in your last 3 hours alive? I decided for the apocalypse that I would walk out into the street and just sit. Sit and wait for some heavy vehicle to rend my body asunder. It was all over. One by one they came, the others. From houses and stopped trucks they came and looked upwards. They sat with me, some gesture of solidarity perhaps.

It had been much easier when he was only a baby, and hadn't quite managed to control or even understand it yet. But as soon as he had been able to speak he had hidden himself away from me and shut down his brain every time I tried to reach inside. It was like he tightened his brain.

I shut the water off and decided I was not going to go back to sleep at this point. Now I have to use a large bowl to sift through the muddy area that was my favorite grill spot because I don't own a shovel.

You travel through time, you have to cause a paradox. And every paradox causes a breach in the time stream. So I had to get rid of that gap. It was something I had to do,\u201d He said.\n\n\n\n",

As there are a few thousand of different intelligent species in the Empire, each with their own unique biological process, the current ruler is an inhabitant of the most numerous and powerful race. Every time the ruler's seat is vacant, each of the intelligent species of the galaxy selects one of its best representatives, who will compete in a series of contests of various sorts, usually until there is one winner. The winner is crowned as the next ruler of the Empire, and gets to govern over it until they die, and the cycle repeats.

        "The year is 2180. Humanity has begun spreading across this galaxy. Yahweh, the Judeo-Christian God, after watching for them for thousands of years and sending many missionaries to inform them of Him, decided that enough was enough. He decided to take a more hands-on approach to their salvation, one last try before He abandoned them. He assembled a very special team of space missionaries, among them Moses and Noah. Unfortunately, the team never made it to Earth. They got caught in a meteor shower and forced to make an emergency landing on the planet of Krypton.\n\nAnd so, their mission on Earth would have to begin on Krypton. This was an important planet. This was the source of much of the technology they use, including their weapons, and it was a godless place. By eliminating the corruptions of this planet and showing its people a better way, they could rid this world of some of the injustices that plague the galaxy.\n\nKrypton was filled with rampant crime and injustice. Every citizen, young and old, had committed some sort of crime at least once. Sex crimes",

        "In the realm where souls reside before we're born, everything is pretty great. There's no poverty, no one wants for anything, everyone knows their purpose, and there's a spirit of cooperation that keeps everything running smoothly. People often stay in this realm in between incarnations.\n\nBut when we incarnate, we go to Earth, where everything is a bit less grand. From an evolutionary point of view, the spirit realm is meant to develop us to make us better candidates for what we get when we're reincarnated.\n\nSo when we die, we go back to the spirit realm. We're there until we're born again.\n\nAs one of my students pointed out, it's a bit ironic that we're born into a world of contrasts: we're born poor, naked, and dependent on others, but we die richer than the richest king. But while we're here, we have to work for it. This is the big lesson of the spirit realm. While we're here, we can learn to have more and to feel less, but to get to the point where we have everything we want and",

If I am not addicted to murder I would not be killing. This article is not a smart ass statement to offend or insult my readers or any organization in any way. This is only an expression of the author.\n\nIn his book No More Words, Thompson takes the position that many murderers will tell him that they enjoyed the \"thrill of the kill.\" That is to say that there is a sexual connotation to murder and perhaps it is a form of lust. However, he also writes in the book, \"Our society offers many outlets and alternatives to vent our stress and lustful frustrations without having to resort to murder. I personally like to run and workout and enjoy a good movie or even go shopping or go out on a date. I am not the murderous type. However, if I did have the desire to kill I do not believe that I would use a gun or a knife. I would most likely use something more dangerous",

        "Lost life The general rule in this generation is that men were not allowed to be in the room while the midwives were helping the woman in labour. These midwives were women who had been training for many years in their village, and they delivered thousands of babies. They knew what to do. In Genesis 3:20, we read how God had declared to the woman: \"I will greatly multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children. Yet your urge shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.\" The number of miscarriages was about the same then as now, but women were expected to accept these losses in a stoic way. Man is just as stupid as he ever was, except that God has less power over him now. But there is a deeper loss. In Leviticus 12, God introduced this further penalty: \"If a woman has conceived and borne a male child, she shall be ceremonially unclean for seven days, as during the days of her menstruation she shall be unclean. On the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. Then she",
