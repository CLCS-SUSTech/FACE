Questions swirl in your head. Why you? And do you have the key to end the war?\n\nThe book is a collection of 25 books, most of them written by historians, that are written about the Middle East history of the Middle East. There are two main components of the book: it is an anthology of stories (which is an edited volume; the other is a non-edited book), and a translation, one of which is published in Germany and is translated into English into different countries, but edited and translated by German.\n\nAfter I finished the volume, I realized I only wanted to read about the Middle East, but the book was very long and very long. I wanted to have a conversation with those who lived there : some of whom have worked there, some who stayed there. Most of the chapters were very much about the past and also about the history and the present state of the Middle East. I wish that this book would be really relevant, but I wanted to create a book that was very interesting that could do with a little bit of fiction, or at least have a little interesting perspective and to be relevant to people and people\u2019s lives\n\nSo here we are. Our book is a short, but quite interesting read as well.\n\nIt has been a day since we left home. Our car has not been recovered. Our parents leave us out on the street everyday. We go on vacation. We are almost constantly being harassed for many of the weeks. Sometimes this is due to bad conduct on our part and sometimes the government seems to care less about the police or the public. The book is a great collection of stories, each of them a major revelation.\n\nThis project is only for people who have lived in many parts of the world.","token_len":400,"entropy":[6.6895,0.0319,5.2936,1.2941,0.1713,2.5537,1.3282,2.8516,5.5833,1.4663,8.7449,9.4463,4.615,4.6537,4.0239,0.0081,2.1664,0.8186,3.2427,3.3475,5.1297,1.8392,4.9321,6.3904,11.99,0.4829,2.6767,6.5484,0.3932,0.2009,0.6273,3.4428,0.2894,11.1609,3.6433,0.9128,10.5264,6.5982,3.4114,0.3645,0.6692,2.1705,3.7125,5.2211,6.2653,3.2067,4.636,0.1385,2.2826,3.1349,6.966,0.2594,7.7889,1.2853,0.7352,0.4665,1.017,0.0037,2.8893,4.646,1.4586,1.934,3.989,0.022,6.0894,3.3669,1.7419,4.2519,0.2163,0.736,2.6035,0.9071,5.7768,1.4571,2.1994,2.7025,3.327,3.1141,0.8791,6.1269,0.5905,6.1829,0.6509,0.4826,3.4993,0.1904,0.8902,3.991,0.6142,4.3946,1.4043,5.1262,2.0226,0.5074,0.2299,0.6809,6.4397,1.9488,2.2017,5.0487,0.3425,3.4987,4.8776,3.9171,2.305,4.122,5.5453,3.8337,5.593,1.9436,2.3294,1.3126,0.7127,5.0367,0.26,0.8936,2.4593,1.6744,0.3809,2.818,5.185,3.3137,5.561,0.803,0.2462,0.7292,3.0598,1.751,6.1738,2.4912,2.6786,2.9301,0.5093,0.7454,4.4911,4.3855,3.6552,3.0061,4.0807,6.9044,2.2196,2.2227,2.2278,4.7362,3.5377,1.19,0.0002,5.5045,3.2414,1.212,0.9287,5.0219,0.5108,0.3452,4.5251,2.1697,5.7107,3.5259,0.3205,2.0172,2.4654,1.0864,1.6562,0.0141,2.4122,2.5872,2.9125,1.922,1.6962,3.7431,3.0868,1.555,2.7129,2.8421,0.6075,1.3094,2.4477,0.163,4.2435,0.7551,4.2923,0.6958,4.6895,0.7298,3.077,1.32,12.2061,4.3289,0.766,2.0395,3.1206,4.7946,2.1016,1.3194,0.9961,0.8935,5.392,0.9467,1.4022,5.4509,0.27,1.193,5.7593,2.0237,3.5045,4.5935,1.1225,1.0466,4.7818,1.6429,5.8248,0.5647,0.645,4.6831,2.8686,1.6441,3.5693,6.785,0.1126,0.7032,0.9669,0.0059,0.4221,2.0771,5.8924,2.6418,3.4897,0.5448,1.1787,1.2762,6.0594,3.8895,2.7426,1.1271,0.9697,3.5494,0.3216,5.4246,0.7218,3.3523,0.5267,2.4127,3.0838,3.1885,6.1248,2.5047,5.0744,4.2011,1.3985,1.0764,0.9042,0.2339,5.8385,1.7509,4.3981,2.3185,0.0953,3.8552,0.8313,1.5161,8.4688,5.7506,3.0952,4.5048,2.9555,4.3462,0.6923,1.5144,4.1948,2.3019,14.1316,7.0203,4.6306,3.7291,6.6886,0.0002,3.5504,3.3637,1.9033,0.379,1.4116,5.0789,3.0786,0.7198,1.9314,4.0821,2.1701,3.0761,4.7197,2.1339,3.0574,6.0998,0.9633,0.5203,1.8041,0.0002,3.8368,3.2926,2.1185,1.6692,6.7631,3.3447,2.1607,3.1161,4.9721,1.1513,3.8613,4.8855,2.1383,3.4164,0.8792,5.4975,1.0569,2.3483,5.0848,5.4863,0.9226,6.2996,2.4611,0.2019,1.2001,7.3978,0.9204,1.2924,3.3634,3.413,2.6878,1.4754,0.9141,2.7772,5.5644,4.334,4.6308,3.8318,4.2042,6.1394,4.1641,1.1543,6.7372,3.2008,4.7461,5.4757,1.2272,3.8611,0.0144,4.6187,7.273,4.3083,0.9578,0.0071,2.8261,1.5078,3.8973,4.9021,5.7373,0.3976,3.7287,2.7056,0.4125,3.0498,6.8548,2.0649,0.865,3.6114,0.9946,3.2652,2.9342,0.8391,2.1044,3.5859,4.9095,0.3698,1.0643,1.6478,5.2557,1.6235,1.2189,2.8091,6.732,5.7937,1.465,0.9515,0.0002,3.7844,6.0968,1.3905,5.386,4.0318,3.4217,0.3466,1.462,3.6168,0.6838,6.7784,2.1121,0.0193,0.1745,0.5298,1.8215]}

[Katherine Sheff\/WireImage]\nThe fashion retailer Pandora Box, based in San Francisco, has announced its latest designer handbag product, a 100-ounce box of colorful handbags. It comes in a range of colors and offers 12 styles.\nThe box consists of 32 styles, from a \"silly\" selection to a \"muffled handbag.\" The bags also feature a color and pattern list that was created by one of Pandora's designers, Katherine Sheff, who created the set herself.\nPandora Box is based in San Francisco and it was founded in January 2018. The line was launched by Kirthruth Taylor, who was the founder of Pandora Box. The brand was established by Laura Gelfand, who also worked on the company founder's line.\n\"Pandora's Box has always been a brand of choice for all of us, and everyone must be excited about the brand's line of unique handbags,\" Sheff said. \"We wanted to create a brand that combines craftsmanship and quality for a true luxury brand, without limiting what we know about our customers. And the brand is truly exceptional in many respects.\"\nIn addition to the handbags, Pandora is currently launching a new line of smartwatch products called Pandora's Watch. To celebrate its new line, they will open up a sale on this special box for only $19.99.\nThe new range will arrive on April 30 and last until Sunday, April 11.

I've been a doctor here and there, and no such problem, but my doctor is kind of an ass about it. (Even when she does mention \"I have a chip implanted in my brain,\" I can remember never having a chip inserted in my brain.)\nBut she may have, and she doesn't really make sense. At the very least, if you're not an active donor, you can try to make her consider you.   Your question is if you had chip implanted in the brain, there may be a chance.   She may not have. I'm not really sure how you can tell if she has a chip implanted into the brain either.\nThere are a lot of people that are transplanted with chip or brain transplants (I had to go in to have both a brain and a bone chip implanted. That's all I've ever known) that have a chip in their brain. Not a sure thing.\nI have a chip and I've had two injections and it's the chip that has caused the chip issue. I got my second one the next day.\nOkay. You may have better luck than most people. Then you would have to go back and try to determine if you have a chip out there and what happened to it after your second injection. Are you happy being able to do both? You said that you have a chip implanted in your brain. Which could mean both, but not the same.\nI've been waiting 5 seconds to hear if I have a chip implanted into me. It's too early to say at this stage, but it'd be nice to have a chip implanted in my brain.   If we've learned anything, it's not that no one can figure out anything. We just keep pushing on. Not to be too harsh on you. :)","token_len":400,"entropy":[3.7506,2.3294,8.0636,4.2189,0.5578,0.2206,1.7852,1.9276,7.0592,1.9638,4.9524,1.3899,0.8607,2.1456,0.4596,1.3485,13.5289,4.9564,1.6607,1.8222,8.9112,2.8958,0.0007,2.1749,1.9311,2.9187,1.3894,1.2591,2.5917,1.0671,2.8253,2.1138,3.8244,2.9376,6.391,3.4005,3.2603,1.505,1.111,5.5455,6.8598,6.2973,2.8318,1.7607,3.8049,2.9432,2.2247,4.989,0.0363,3.6242,4.3772,4.8919,0.7021,0.3736,5.8754,8.3186,2.8042,3.5488,4.0403,5.2486,4.6255,3.9166,1.4591,0.2156,0.1646,0.44,0.0497,0.0497,0.0113,1.1134,1.8722,2.7876,5.7805,6.6921,1.9217,1.741,0.5553,5.1091,0.5542,0.2663,0.2348,1.1984,0.748,3.2369,3.7258,5.7536,1.1678,5.9408,2.0202,1.4441,3.5135,0.0006,3.8365,6.0628,3.0659,1.1464,5.6016,1.9996,1.8915,0.0379,0.1293,3.7511,1.105,1.8591,2.872,3.6776,5.8086,6.6184,0.4978,1.1109,2.9389,5.1486,0.8984,3.1914,2.9067,6.0628,2.3178,2.3948,8.8481,5.9017,7.8214,6.357,1.3511,5.9134,0.8564,5.0038,5.3108,0.6444,0.5278,3.5,0.4358,1.3078,6.4388,3.3937,0.3515,1.4022,3.1078,3.5359,1.9721,0.7496,3.816,1.4293,1.8923,2.3512,2.8546,4.0123,2.2556,1.0541,4.2907,0.2935,2.6585,2.5357,2.1675,2.9523,1.6918,1.6891,1.7807,1.2289,0.0585,0.3183,4.8096,2.0942,0.0904,6.3947,0.4519,1.3051,4.26,1.0843,2.0692,1.3457,0.0195,2.1125,3.2412,2.2506,7.378,0.0465,2.3343,3.7136,5.6704,3.1244,2.2131,0.0185,4.6551,3.1814,5.1111,3.2848,3.1405,4.6083,1.6992,3.7889,5.9831,4.7735,1.8696,1.2075,0.7357,5.442,4.6712,1.1867,3.9918,4.2522,1.1068,4.3572,0.9216,3.1092,2.3499,3.7377,3.6445,1.3503,1.3095,2.6282,1.3935,3.8776,0.2948,0.5839,1.007,5.9107,1.7639,9.0981,0.2052,0.9864,1.8558,2.1979,2.4656,1.3444,1.0727,4.9545,1.1609,2.8202,2.157,3.2769,4.914,3.1139,3.0015,1.0859,4.4885,4.254,1.0959,2.7316,4.184,1.3154,4.6653,6.4892,0.3426,1.7428,4.5753,2.9672,3.5495,2.0378,4.5997,3.2147,0.3124,0.9356,1.7529,7.1207,1.6688,3.8012,3.7068,1.2853,6.8518,1.1805,3.1198,3.7224,0.8101,1.296,6.3168,1.8261,5.3036,1.671,1.0624,2.6164,2.0076,1.161,1.6027,0.9825,4.2927,0.7375,0.9971,1.3125,0.6423,0.1168,8.0015,0.333,2.9316,3.7629,4.2482,1.4018,0.7012,4.1335,3.3122,1.2775,1.5242,0.3613,6.2118,0.418,5.3675,6.8392,2.9517,0.0039,3.3533,4.6893,1.7284,4.2973,6.2787,2.0299,0.9928,2.2547,0.9206,0.2008,1.0837,0.293,0.3146,0.0643,0.9996,5.6405,5.1481,1.9086,5.6678,3.895,1.3046,3.5337,2.6438,0.8636,2.4347,1.0147,2.2063,2.8712,1.9979,5.9499,6.5106,5.6917,1.4999,4.0018,2.8603,1.8839,1.1901,0.3196,0.1021,0.8353,3.3992,3.1404,0.6283,3.1287,0.9158,4.7919,1.5938,0.555,2.1583,5.4294,0.3401,3.0445,1.894,0.362,2.0733,5.7173,0.3896,2.0458,0.6088,1.984,1.2256,2.2259,1.0437,0.5707,0.7539,0.1166,0.8454,2.1576,0.5086,3.153,4.7999,4.7739,4.9098,0.5448,2.1266,0.1357,0.2494,3.8882,1.1055,6.2341,0.6484,3.1626,4.897,0.5085,5.309,1.2874,3.2561,2.1063,5.2445,4.8497,3.0957,1.1773,6.4286,3.3942,2.8415,2.36,3.4379,1.6884,2.0383,1.2694,6.9902]}

Not to mention all of the other things that people are just seeing.","token_len":401,"entropy":[4.0641,5.7875,3.7279,2.0549,4.2293,0.017,2.3443,8.8593,10.1017,2.9306,0.7373,1.2459,11.8085,0.6585,0.1005,2.2255,1.9035,6.122,4.4843,1.4674,3.5488,3.1199,0.9965,7.2252,1.2381,2.1804,3.7527,2.3533,5.9553,4.8132,0.0195,4.6353,2.6276,3.2698,3.9338,6.9278,2.757,1.05,0.4626,0.3863,0.8795,0.3691,0.0005,0.7242,0.7394,0.9786,3.1185,0.2826,0.3279,0.4154,0.2773,0.2518,0.0702,0.0006,5.5322,0.7134,0.8658,0.5744,0.2712,0.1308,0.1495,0.1342,0.0677,0.0122,0.0005,5.6495,0.6046,0.6193,0.3703,0.3187,0.0631,0.0898,0.0679,0.0307,0.009,0.0005,3.0474,0.6996,0.4014,3.9272,0.3213,6.5331,0.0011,0.5136,0.6336,0.3726,0.3166,0.0013,1.846,1.2062,0.53,0.8382,0.2044,0.7272,0.2394,0.048,0.0147,0.0147,0.0004,3.6364,0.5123,0.2492,2.8262,0.2277,1.4479,0.0003,0.0295,0.0433,0.0144,0.0106,0.0003,5.6365,0.6926,0.1481,0.3983,0.1298,0.737,0.0003,0.0059,0.0137,0.0046,0.0101,0.0004,5.7649,0.115,0.0016,0.0,0.0,0.604,0.2117,2.4818,0.1252,0.4005,0.0002,0.0107,0.0185,0.008,0.0195,0.0005,4.0751,1.1626,4.2139,3.7105,4.6408,2.6456,0.3609,0.3938,3.1111,3.3371,4.905,6.1531,5.1016,6.7052,2.1543,5.357,1.1062,1.9011,2.0828,1.2496,0.0393,5.5542,5.1022,4.892,2.3497,0.652,0.0772,3.7354,0.2606,2.5698,7.3582,2.8468,0.5249,0.0002,4.9662,2.6881,2.3804,4.2251,8.154,4.5178,6.0623,2.2867,1.8703,3.3374,3.3251,6.3992,2.1991,0.9508,0.0001,0.9627,0.7712,0.2684,2.9187,4.6792,2.9626,0.0013,4.7915,4.8167,0.7057,0.0001,6.6195,3.9752,2.8558,4.8031,1.2947,2.9685,3.1592,1.9555,0.3263,4.7447,5.0116,0.0093,1.0844,1.7685,1.9582,1.6676,2.6117,0.0021,5.2667,2.6057,6.5716,2.2505,6.2375,2.653,0.8142,3.4883,1.4291,0.4028,4.7417,3.3378,0.5876,3.4153,1.9089,0.4906,6.3068,2.0499,2.8623,0.3133,0.0017,4.4776,0.8444,2.4846,3.0573,2.5239,3.0326,5.4164,2.6003,3.8235,0.3599,0.7999,2.0203,5.4548,0.1686,0.1219,1.1148,0.0001,2.1654,1.9617,1.9381,6.6884,0.0133,1.6679,2.672,4.4015,0.6867,3.4022,2.5102,3.5358,5.6424,2.3231,4.4498,3.3473,0.4805,0.1287,0.0001,0.6844,0.9404,1.9745,2.9592,1.641,2.3964,3.1588,2.8441,2.4434,5.3273,1.9456,0.5184,0.1415,0.0001,3.0401,1.1552,1.2816,4.9778,3.3218,3.0552,1.8713,5.2515,1.7484,2.7361,0.107,0.8745,0.5267,0.1635,0.0001,4.2138,3.2961,1.8034,0.2616,3.2579,1.6338,2.5122,5.3574,4.2995,2.3058,3.3549,1.8196,2.2977,0.9441,3.7344,5.1336,0.0009,6.4655,1.5897,4.7962,1.9184,5.7074,4.8389,1.321,4.4254,3.6903,1.5413,2.9878,4.4571,0.7524,2.2795,0.167,5.6841,1.0384,4.1754,1.6775,3.6443,0.5852,1.7763,2.3219,4.4541,0.0665,4.4104,4.4418,2.9471,1.3728,5.1462,0.395,3.162,1.0942,5.1226,4.5013,6.4864,5.6045,5.3015,3.3061,0.6901,4.3502,1.9733,3.0713,2.4707,3.5143,6.5765,0.5608,3.6206,0.7211,3.8792,5.062,3.2818,2.5518,5.9746,7.0334,0.8091,2.8316,2.715,4.8426,0.0768,0.8746,3.587,5.273,0.758,4.838,0.6787,5.9337,3.0532,0.3511,4.3086,2.0427,0.4364,1.323,1.2465,0.8454,2.6313,1.9318,5.5763,4.0848,0.8665]}

Now she has a voice who believes you, she has said hello, and you have a voice that she may have imagined she had.\n\nYou've never heard an interview before?  Maybe you did. Because what if it was not true?  You've never heard them before?  You've never heard them before.  They aren't like your friends because they are not friends.  They are like you... and only you.  And if you had said you had never heard them before, what would've happened?  You would have done as much to help your friend as they have done you.\n\nYou are a stranger to me.  You may think you are a stranger.  You may think you are a stranger.  You may think that I will do as you have done me.  You may think you are a stranger.  But you're different.  You are a stranger because you are a stranger.  You have never seen and experienced what life is like between you and the human being in question....and how much worse you are.\n\nAnd that's why I'm trying hard to make it harder for you to listen to my friends.

And you have never been told that your religious beliefs are wrong and no one can deny or explain their religious beliefs.  Because religious beliefs are the basis for religion.  It is the basis of who you have become, who you have become, and so many other things.","token_len":401,"entropy":[3.8828,2.7333,11.92,7.136,13.7687,2.057,2.206,6.7707,4.3824,6.3904,0.6701,1.1883,5.8864,1.3133,1.1024,5.1907,5.1621,1.1354,2.2345,7.0136,7.6046,0.4394,0.61,3.1597,1.0098,0.9771,3.5519,1.4133,2.1653,2.0729,0.909,0.0584,1.072,12.4486,2.0483,5.114,0.3766,4.1999,3.9694,6.0034,1.4596,5.6758,8.543,1.5152,1.5903,7.018,7.0843,4.5936,6.3844,0.492,2.9907,10.3633,5.9768,11.2079,3.9544,4.361,3.0385,2.4437,3.7965,5.6282,1.5412,4.8632,1.191,3.0748,0.8457,2.8528,1.313,4.3582,4.2046,2.5916,2.0976,4.1143,5.8753,3.8615,2.0997,3.9428,4.3518,2.8522,5.5423,6.6001,1.5594,0.6881,1.1691,1.734,2.9722,2.4667,1.3207,3.4105,5.1547,2.263,6.4522,3.331,2.453,1.5384,3.5302,0.4654,2.0099,4.3018,3.6727,1.574,4.2441,6.7565,2.1517,5.0475,7.5528,9.799,1.0451,3.5906,1.3781,6.2107,4.0264,1.9609,2.2746,1.4237,3.9743,2.5267,0.3337,1.5526,2.9783,2.6448,1.0724,0.6017,6.2418,1.5131,0.9787,0.4596,2.182,0.9566,0.3485,0.5799,0.749,1.1986,3.5864,1.0943,4.6644,5.2276,0.0006,4.3232,2.6232,3.9633,6.4157,0.7689,1.4858,2.5026,4.2092,0.8504,0.3737,0.8529,0.5005,1.8508,2.1787,4.7583,2.899,5.78,0.3536,1.1073,1.0151,3.1142,3.5774,0.9485,4.2066,4.5554,3.11,2.4544,2.7464,0.2957,0.8279,0.1777,0.3345,3.2233,0.4743,6.1053,0.2981,0.384,0.3899,1.9262,0.9377,1.9345,6.1926,5.5787,3.1701,2.1891,4.1469,2.8823,1.3204,0.5345,5.2916,2.9599,2.0969,2.6454,0.516,1.6021,0.0003,1.7725,2.7245,1.8923,2.6007,1.9962,3.6505,0.8737,0.453,1.2804,4.7017,3.3789,1.0124,1.0435,1.8493,0.5942,2.8013,0.1159,0.9433,0.1583,0.8958,0.3284,0.3047,0.8476,0.3063,0.9973,0.1436,0.6567,0.1498,0.2445,2.9414,3.8329,3.7134,4.2002,1.9928,1.9606,2.2558,1.2503,3.1393,0.6044,0.1557,0.913,0.2664,0.341,1.8528,0.7054,0.2513,0.031,1.131,0.0943,3.2011,1.239,3.6762,5.6563,0.5233,0.2548,0.554,0.9746,1.8066,0.4123,3.2668,0.4846,1.0624,1.572,0.6576,0.5596,0.4679,0.8033,2.7082,2.7063,2.9714,4.7844,2.9603,3.751,4.8785,0.6673,0.0245,7.9798,0.6312,0.3201,3.3387,5.5364,1.9453,4.0336,3.3482,7.2455,3.6668,5.3082,3.8863,5.2078,2.6439,1.4277,1.5448,0.898,0.0003,3.4695,2.9846,0.8061,1.7031,0.9046,1.9847,4.2038,3.7851,0.336,2.1751,1.8412,5.4576,0.4268,0.1847,0.6628,5.0939,0.7646,2.8692,6.2556,0.7982,0.2116,2.2831,2.5332,3.904,2.2212,3.8945,2.8333,5.2752,1.2374,2.4616,1.5444,0.1102,1.4283,3.3207,4.2162,4.4628,4.1436,3.5539,1.2174,2.6631,3.9092,0.8293,3.1573,3.3001,3.5901,1.8228,1.7,5.5874,0.0006,2.3121,2.3398,0.6075,0.8477,0.8812,1.0721,6.8974,1.2032,0.2035,2.2218,1.9276,1.4439,1.7428,1.501,0.156,1.1482,2.5119,4.9126,0.8618,0.8267,2.2139,3.024,5.8124,0.4992,2.2349,3.2949,4.7717,5.0434,3.2134,2.7455,0.2805,0.5477,0.1781,3.6633,6.0916,1.018,0.5405,3.0696,3.7017,1.0287,3.5418,0.5594,0.3509,3.5421,1.0627,1.3779,1.1473,1.0315,5.2175,0.5491,6.2906,1.0963,2.5459,2.0655,0.1082,2.1096,1.0746,1.2979,1.0078,5.222,3.3383,1.0812,0.7792,1.2285]}

It offers insight about our history while using the technology of technology in a positive, creative way. The book is interesting and it focuses on the psychology of schoolboy.\n\nRichard Dawkins' The Secret of Schoolboy.by Richard Dawkins (1984), deals with this problem. It talks about how to explain to students and help them focus on how to be aware of their weaknesses. It is an easy read and easy to read. Dawkins also tells the story of The Kid in the Sky.\n\nRichard Dawkins explores issues as to why people can be successful today in life. He asks students to find their flaws and to let go of their weaknesses.\n\nHe also explores why there are many differences between children (and parents) in most areas of life. He also discusses what it means to be a Christian today and how to find that purpose in existence. He discusses where to shop or get things delivered to you, and why to be a Christian.\n\nThe book The Secret of Schoolboy.by Richard Dawkins (1984), shows the impact that technology has in many aspects of life.

{"id":790,"ended":true,"length":330,"text":"A billionare is brought back to life 6 hours after clinical death. He tells noone of what he saw while dead, but immediately isolates himself in his mansion and devotes his entire fortune into finding the key to immortality. A journalist has been sent to interview the man about his experience.\n\nThe book is a collection of 25 books, most of them written by historians, that are written about the life, history and circumstances of Albert Viguer-Sargent, famous as a \"war hero\" \u2013 famous for his war of the 18th century \u2013 and not just the historical drama.\n\nHis first book, 1849: A Poetic Journey into the Age of the Enlightenment, is described as \"a very personal and intense read\" by Viguer-Sargent's friend Robert Elmore. The book chronicles his own experiences in the war and the subsequent years as he battled his own fears and hopes for the best in his future endeavours. Viguer-Sargent won the War of the Armies on October 13th 1849, but the Battle of Waterloo had taken place in North Rhine-Westphalia, around 1330.\n\nIn 1849, Viguer-Sargent led his soldiers, using his own artillery, to confront the French forces that had attacked his stronghold in Algiers, in a drive to take the town of Lille. The French captured the town in a fierce shootout with the Aged Group, an ethnic group known for their ethnic violence, although this was to be limited to those fighting on the ground. While the majority of the French troops fought for this seat of power only around the time of Viguer-Sargent's death, that could change in the years to come. Viguer-Sargent would later be arrested by the British Army and would die in the British prison cells of the Metropolitan Correctional Center in D\u00fcsseldorf in March 1857.","token_len":402,"entropy":[8.9319,11.5639,7.9223,8.4181,3.6475,1.2778,3.233,9.3416,4.2068,1.0104,10.9611,4.9492,1.2819,6.4999,5.2328,8.0244,5.0773,4.3489,2.2768,1.8022,3.1169,5.0149,6.5249,2.2662,2.0949,7.8987,11.7374,0.0102,1.5808,2.7126,1.6283,7.7471,1.7387,7.8816,0.7145,1.6959,3.1658,6.7552,5.485,5.2654,2.0173,5.716,0.5219,4.958,0.365,4.509,8.6221,4.6252,2.838,2.4842,0.3685,4.8258,2.1845,2.0424,3.9613,0.9468,3.2958,1.2219,2.8256,0.0296,2.4275,3.5652,1.443,2.1109,4.1539,0.0234,6.6661,3.1639,1.7672,3.8731,0.3059,0.939,2.6963,0.8583,7.8017,1.4399,2.748,2.3705,3.4495,2.8259,0.9686,2.0829,3.2776,6.7897,1.0039,6.9924,0.08,5.2104,6.6956,4.1047,1.9413,12.039,3.0131,6.9783,0.0667,0.9083,6.1232,2.6373,2.3115,4.2634,6.2454,0.783,0.792,7.0187,6.0054,0.4657,1.0083,4.4214,4.1539,2.7297,5.6954,0.8289,0.2408,3.5081,1.5212,6.1335,1.9366,3.185,6.4734,5.0455,1.6972,1.3935,0.0004,4.686,3.7949,0.5112,0.6581,6.2754,3.8545,3.3806,1.9403,6.4799,2.6382,3.7949,3.1656,0.7027,4.78,0.0141,2.0226,4.7699,0.3534,1.5622,5.4683,0.599,1.2506,1.066,4.7912,4.671,2.1729,6.3219,4.21,2.0258,1.4346,5.7669,0.0113,0.0092,0.0647,0.0022,0.0086,0.0037,1.7383,2.5853,4.6641,6.5688,3.7188,0.9698,2.3213,0.9801,4.6855,0.0063,0.9568,4.3702,3.1868,2.2019,1.3482,4.1741,2.2936,1.692,3.361,3.0001,2.6634,1.1486,4.7594,2.8202,3.1026,4.9625,1.1457,3.9911,1.5817,1.4431,5.2564,3.3699,2.0864,4.6888,5.8844,0.0009,0.2047,4.3504,0.0012,0.0048,0.0024,0.001,0.0047,0.0032,6.3637,0.9703,5.4236,0.246,0.401,7.2896,0.0602,5.2137,4.1098,3.6011,2.311,1.9809,0.4161,1.2509,2.8018,2.8408,5.3733,0.044,2.5378,3.155,4.4666,1.8785,2.7713,7.2312,6.5947,0.0064,0.0648,0.0006,0.001,0.0,1.3455,6.7875,5.3724,3.5016,0.7847,0.9137,0.0002,2.7486,1.1469,1.0792,0.7197,1.3301,0.0015,0.0095,0.0019,0.0012,0.003,0.0032,5.2753,1.4859,4.0557,4.2789,5.474,2.0971,2.5772,6.4531,0.7999,1.3211,5.1207,1.0351,2.1575,3.9533,2.8163,0.5631,3.5288,2.9481,4.1486,1.7252,5.5281,1.939,0.0037,1.7256,2.8576,3.1005,6.2184,1.5618,4.0673,1.9168,2.6482,1.5773,4.4442,1.9976,0.5762,1.9112,1.5394,4.6965,1.0563,0.6322,2.8448,1.8837,3.2582,8.2783,1.9439,0.6288,7.4155,6.8277,7.4556,1.1837,3.188,6.2355,1.0544,3.1686,0.7628,0.837,5.6334,3.66,2.1683,5.5684,3.4118,1.1004,5.3195,0.4224,6.9418,0.3631,4.8381,4.9866,2.3525,0.6054,4.5212,0.365,5.5824,1.4063,5.3735,0.1185,0.6393,1.4524,3.2658,3.923,3.2896,5.8158,8.6263,1.1772,0.5732,7.3846,5.5854,2.1056,1.6223,0.6564,2.916,0.0081,0.0047,0.0035,0.0015,0.0034,0.0026,0.1336,1.255,0.153,6.0513,4.8765,3.2184,2.2664,0.8566,2.2272,0.2498,0.0625,0.2911,3.661,0.0047,0.0061,0.0036,0.0013,0.005,0.0027,3.724,2.491,2.5205,5.2157,1.6521,0.7516,2.8172,3.3472,1.7444,7.1659,3.0566,0.8441,2.6909,4.5992,2.3022,4.9984,2.4263,2.3147,7.7911,4.3916,3.177,0.857,4.9592,3.2371,0.0519,0.001,0.0,0.0,2.2908,4.9433,0.4716,4.6863,0.2737]}

The band, which had been producing their own music all their lives, recorded the track and released it the same year as their debut album.\nThe album garnered the likes of Rolling Stone, MTV and NPR in 2007. The band still tours with their own music.\nTheir first hit, \"Back In Town,\" was released in 2006 on Columbia Records, featuring the Stones and Johnny Cash.

{"id":2881,"ended":true,"length":389,"text":"You have a power. Everyone thinks this power is completely lame. They are wrong.\nI don't think I'm the only one who thought a power was lame.\nYeah I didn't see it, thought it was pretty lame.\nIt's pretty lame if you ask me. \"A power of a different gender\" I mean the power of the power of not having the ability to be a power, if you will.\nYou are one dimensional.\nNo I'm not, if I were I wouldn't give a shit about \"the power\", how you treat people is beyond question.\nYou're being negative but the power of sex, in certain genders, is more significant as to whether or not male people can be powerful. The other side of the spectrum is that we can all be powerful regardless of our sexual desires.\nI'd argue that even in many cases the more power and control women can have over men is a function of our own individual beliefs. That being said I agree with you that they should have the ability to control other women, or at least have their own personal opinions and beliefs that give the power to men to the detriment of women.\nYou are completely correct in that the only reason a power is important in women is because of how strong they are, not just how strong they are.\nYeah, this. Like you can't really argue that a power is *legendary*, like it's just because it's not important. I agree that powerful women are far from important in the world of fiction. When we get into a debate about the effects of power, we usually forget about power.\nYes, but we talk about power in a negative conversation. Like women have had powerful experiences too, and it feels so good when women are being able to talk about it.\nI see what you're saying. When I think 'power' I think 'power of another gender' and it goes to mean 'power is always stronger than power'.","token_len":402,"entropy":[3.7506,2.3294,7.2423,4.0973,7.6515,4.638,4.3237,3.0734,0.4648,7.3026,8.739,0.7807,3.7862,2.9001,4.1627,0.4278,2.4391,7.126,3.0915,0.0011,2.0448,2.5613,2.0901,2.9156,0.186,0.3458,0.5281,4.28,5.2826,1.91,1.4781,0.6642,0.3691,2.4884,6.1316,3.6698,5.2378,0.0006,3.8388,1.253,3.0012,7.1158,0.8252,0.5718,4.9767,0.2618,0.3471,0.6253,3.2991,0.882,3.7857,0.3093,3.4265,0.3924,3.8138,0.0855,0.3459,6.7353,4.7865,0.7845,4.4596,2.797,3.9642,6.1286,2.8299,3.2735,2.4439,3.8144,1.8376,1.0399,2.4946,5.625,0.5687,5.2558,1.7946,3.3034,2.7049,0.2003,3.1304,2.1392,4.6151,2.5548,4.8163,0.5217,3.5441,0.4446,0.8662,2.8206,2.7386,4.9752,7.0332,0.8715,1.2497,3.9732,2.5091,1.0507,0.1885,2.8649,4.6819,1.4836,3.1991,2.0954,2.0287,0.0005,5.3517,2.2927,0.7455,1.0385,5.6918,3.6078,0.6301,4.7708,5.4259,3.3264,4.6209,1.8449,2.9557,4.1859,5.2616,0.3575,0.4668,2.1418,2.2915,5.2099,5.7715,5.8523,4.0518,1.2338,1.9334,6.7844,3.0501,4.2677,5.8915,7.8702,0.9281,0.6441,3.7535,5.6178,5.9643,4.7472,3.0028,0.9734,0.0022,7.0754,5.8036,2.1688,0.9751,4.5785,0.7165,4.2896,4.9108,3.718,0.6279,1.725,2.2794,0.5872,1.9255,4.2268,3.0337,5.0085,1.0544,2.302,5.6941,0.076,1.8451,3.0824,5.2995,0.674,0.8247,2.0698,4.6,3.7144,0.6957,4.8365,3.6518,5.9523,1.3331,2.7801,5.4237,3.2482,4.9095,3.8611,4.318,4.8121,0.459,3.2946,1.3036,4.3234,2.9401,5.5578,0.0419,2.819,3.4105,4.9068,5.4498,1.1538,4.4527,2.9409,0.0247,1.8865,5.3959,0.5961,1.6287,1.0893,5.4331,2.8368,2.2787,1.5754,1.8078,0.082,1.8252,4.141,1.6697,1.7083,3.9598,1.1826,0.1356,2.827,3.2673,0.7118,3.9467,3.0207,2.9829,3.1766,3.4917,6.4759,4.3284,0.677,0.5872,3.3439,4.3147,5.2438,2.6598,0.0179,0.4502,0.3103,0.5828,2.9665,1.9783,5.1765,3.391,2.4129,1.6816,3.1141,3.3038,2.7248,3.1941,1.8557,1.3976,4.5055,2.8166,4.3541,0.8535,1.1186,2.0071,2.7592,3.8787,2.0299,0.2109,2.3181,2.1393,3.8423,2.0119,1.0533,0.4592,0.2912,0.6098,0.6956,5.3873,1.6993,4.6886,7.1207,5.8732,2.8724,3.9956,1.5317,3.5179,3.6681,1.3168,2.5365,0.391,0.5322,7.2842,6.2366,3.1513,0.1327,2.577,4.5203,2.6732,0.8405,2.917,4.1469,1.6906,0.5029,2.8487,4.6603,1.0751,2.8593,4.1151,1.4925,6.8598,0.6758,1.1702,4.6431,2.8813,5.2288,2.3362,2.0223,2.2346,2.498,4.4386,1.3517,5.587,2.9494,4.0469,2.4774,2.3295,5.6954,0.906,2.7404,6.8747,0.2164,2.2035,1.6824,1.29,3.9703,5.2211,2.3129,2.4838,1.5237,1.3534,5.1515,0.8112,3.3071,3.0064,5.2863,0.2097,0.6773,2.2279,1.3962,5.6959,9.8082,1.0574,4.3704,5.1759,2.9169,6.0739,5.1572,4.5903,5.5865,1.0136,1.8983,3.0789,5.9046,4.329,2.7699,2.8226,2.9506,1.8221,4.2936,3.4191,0.0188,3.5469,0.2656,1.6807,0.7385,0.7687,2.2151,4.2992,3.8499,0.1699,0.8427,0.3867,1.0225,4.7014,2.396,3.3516,8.0615,1.8228,0.9937,1.9469,1.0701,2.1221,2.0047,1.6401,5.289,0.2948,1.4078,1.6512,2.5763,5.2133,3.3488,6.2606,2.5733,1.4,6.1712,6.3034,4.8988,0.7141,1.1421,2.3777]}
{"id":2930,"ended":false,"length":387,"text":"The news just broke on the latest celebrity suicide. It's the president of the United States.'\nThe Trump administration announced yesterday that it will no longer allow the White House to fire special counsel Robert Mueller. It will call for a two year ban on White House Counsel, Larry Kudlow. \"This action follows a recent letter from Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jerry Nadler, Jr., who says that Mueller may not return until January 6, 2026. It is my hope that this request will finally help protect and promote the independence of federal law enforcement and judicial officers. Attorney General William Barr had said recently that he would not return until January 6, 2026 because Mueller's work is \"truly critical to our democracy.\"\nThe news just has to take its toll \u2014 and we can all get by. \"The news comes in the wake of a week of reports of an alleged plot by the President to discredit investigative journalist Robert Mueller.\"\nAs you can tell from the headlines, everyone must be worried about Trump's recent move to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, or at least his behavior in the last two weeks. But the president and his allies, particularly in the media, are going to have to wait. And the next few days will likely be really hard. People who have been covering the Mueller investigation for the last two years have experienced the daily news cycle that has been pretty relentless and full of stories and reports of how many investigations are coming true, but also many of the other scandals that have become headlines:\n1.

Alien abductions can be thought of in parts of the world as a \"cultural genocide\" that was a precursor to the world's most violent civil wars.\nSome of the most notorious abductions that happened in the U.S. were made in the early 1800s in California, Texas and Florida.\nThe United Nations says the attacks were caused by a combination of human error, mistaken identity and fear.\nA survivor says she was abducted by aliens,\nA person who has made a comment on the post, said\n\"I heard about this horrible attack...a group of aliens kidnapped me and my friends because they wanted me to go to another planet... I know I wanted this too... I want to die so I got married... this is my life now... I want to survive this nightmare\"\nWhile the attack was probably caused by human error, some of the most notorious abductions were made in California, Texas and Florida.\nA UN expert has suggested that the most serious human kidnapping was made in California, Texas and Florida.\n\"These people were abducted by aliens and then they kidnapped everyone. I think they were hoping for something. And they're not the first. We already know humans are capable of this.\"\nThis story will be updated as the post continues.","token_len":404,"entropy":[9.9962,12.0457,3.6409,9.557,4.7167,2.3538,3.2468,5.755,1.0148,9.5591,0.0342,4.6181,1.9748,6.4673,4.8198,1.6819,0.0906,0.0007,9.6087,4.3413,4.846,6.1216,4.6979,6.613,6.317,0.0216,0.5481,0.5059,7.1654,2.9822,5.2605,1.5168,2.646,4.3202,1.1348,3.7405,1.6418,1.8066,5.5194,1.6718,5.8548,1.6406,0.8221,4.2805,1.7645,4.6551,6.4682,2.0096,3.2633,7.047,7.9966,0.9441,1.8441,2.8765,4.2094,4.7184,0.3208,1.6494,4.3173,2.5641,3.5337,5.3218,1.9403,4.3974,2.1002,1.9512,4.9967,3.6219,2.2742,2.0869,0.0101,0.1841,1.771,5.1113,6.4374,5.5218,1.1972,0.9716,5.0556,3.2598,6.1088,0.9836,2.8643,0.3808,1.8674,2.1101,1.4326,1.2248,2.7928,3.1716,1.9774,0.4856,0.6954,2.3931,3.235,2.7965,1.1187,5.7454,6.1457,5.9819,3.3534,0.0379,3.0568,1.5064,1.3593,4.4537,0.162,2.6479,1.2098,2.1485,2.0296,4.0067,4.951,5.5228,2.2728,3.6246,3.2628,5.242,3.4173,1.9354,0.425,5.0187,0.0022,4.9149,0.3369,5.1123,3.7528,5.989,1.6774,1.4203,3.5481,4.9039,2.853,4.2823,1.6394,4.5915,1.802,3.0081,4.2645,0.0253,1.3656,2.1046,0.3771,0.8142,6.3466,1.8959,0.1792,3.8986,1.2515,5.3144,0.1786,4.2787,8.3833,0.4844,0.4556,1.1758,1.9977,1.4972,3.7753,5.326,1.9333,1.2194,2.1934,4.1697,4.46,4.8862,0.1725,0.923,4.7099,0.4862,4.9987,3.0377,2.6569,1.1024,0.5304,0.5241,4.797,1.577,0.3317,2.1222,2.8071,0.6577,0.4074,4.1018,3.6406,1.1268,0.5306,4.122,0.0023,0.015,0.1323,1.6899,4.2723,1.4674,0.9199,2.3181,2.9787,0.0586,2.889,3.3146,0.6554,2.8078,1.1336,3.0574,0.7647,1.1004,2.0974,3.877,2.0468,3.314,2.3574,5.6268,1.3808,3.2173,0.154,1.8911,3.4004,0.0094,2.7124,3.5789,1.0438,6.518,1.6311,0.5432,4.3508,1.2047,0.7143,3.3421,5.8611,3.7499,1.439,1.0332,1.7693,0.9976,0.3918,2.9849,7.3907,3.6967,4.5067,1.5422,2.7998,5.5629,2.1098,5.2738,2.1544,1.6941,3.3119,2.8473,4.0113,4.4754,1.6785,1.4809,4.247,2.7489,1.9559,5.3701,3.1827,5.0493,5.2397,3.1926,0.2247,1.6405,4.1521,1.1065,1.6357,3.2064,3.0848,5.176,0.9537,2.1958,2.3411,0.1806,2.7141,0.9154,4.5504,0.4899,3.1765,2.9691,5.6944,2.4881,6.298,4.9805,5.1085,2.133,2.1608,3.9343,0.7202,3.4959,3.5521,0.9243,6.1181,4.6275,2.7776,4.8707,0.8514,2.3469,2.0958,2.2195,1.4082,1.4131,1.7199,0.325,4.7785,3.1213,5.2185,4.0007,0.4112,5.3079,1.5026,4.7453,1.7945,4.3258,3.0087,0.0809,3.077,0.1872,0.2372,3.0441,1.396,0.0894,1.1397,1.0356,0.1565,0.0053,3.1515,0.0143,0.0075,6.5141,0.1237,0.0703,0.0135,0.0054,0.1719,0.553,2.6161,7.0773,3.9721,2.3279,3.7572,0.4744,1.3375,5.0069,3.9386,3.1184,5.5121,2.0931,2.4538,0.6148,2.9589,1.6111,0.6639,0.3492,0.2239,0.9015,0.3813,1.6154,4.138,3.1354,1.5976,3.0815,1.2205,0.3082,2.2868,2.6994,2.0428,3.288,5.1811,3.1996,3.1322,1.4573,2.0368,1.3995,6.1557,2.3371,2.5898,4.0781,3.2898,1.6566,3.8297,1.666,4.0172,2.9357,2.6798,3.6907,6.0939,0.4842,6.3973,1.0645,3.5636,0.0203,3.5251,3.6766,0.3831,4.1111,3.5715,3.3095,0.2429,0.3033,0.7588,4.1967,7.2314,5.4687,0.905]}

And the whole 'God is the One Who Wishes' thing for the people who were killed in this movie is something we've been working on for a very long time.\"","token_len":406,"entropy":[5.2847,3.4964,2.1092,5.3782,4.6447,2.6834,5.0554,4.5784,3.9601,0.001,8.5915,1.9113,6.7574,5.0895,4.8048,6.6889,2.7189,0.3233,3.811,2.954,3.9893,8.7376,4.3423,1.2698,3.6131,2.7911,0.9027,1.8174,5.8346,2.4686,5.1981,2.8098,2.9163,4.4362,0.405,3.8232,2.573,7.5472,0.3699,2.8353,5.5518,1.8879,2.0357,4.9824,6.9983,0.9162,8.4248,2.5805,0.9273,0.0249,0.6844,5.1664,4.7029,7.5673,2.1202,3.7699,2.6771,0.4517,3.7002,6.2851,3.0575,5.011,3.2144,1.5364,3.7323,6.1875,1.5665,2.3703,0.9779,0.9659,4.9175,1.1203,4.9345,5.3005,5.2561,3.8714,6.9599,3.0164,0.5024,1.1925,7.2562,0.1289,1.4256,2.7214,5.2386,0.1892,5.6374,0.3267,4.0384,0.039,0.8563,5.6462,0.9887,2.569,4.8932,4.2019,9.398,0.5184,5.8543,3.4367,3.9061,1.279,0.2935,4.6234,0.9129,5.7986,1.4127,2.9747,5.0151,0.3135,1.8462,0.0422,0.3979,0.4257,2.0712,4.7938,6.0151,1.0843,4.5288,5.8509,0.0364,2.2532,0.7896,1.0037,1.2333,0.8123,0.2856,0.4265,4.8618,1.6229,4.7412,2.1645,3.1359,0.4009,2.3454,5.5255,1.3643,2.6047,6.019,1.8766,3.8937,1.1728,4.2723,3.1757,0.5222,5.3279,0.1084,3.6505,5.499,2.0998,3.2661,3.6493,0.0653,1.4062,5.5843,3.3393,2.3865,1.3767,1.94,5.1677,6.076,0.0114,3.6014,7.4863,1.3289,8.0686,2.6202,0.0813,1.3007,0.1,2.7366,4.7091,6.2157,1.3206,0.8153,6.4667,1.9733,6.6416,4.3299,3.8248,1.468,0.8094,5.6877,0.1467,4.4543,5.7773,1.3856,2.7096,4.0151,5.8546,3.3247,1.9153,1.1577,2.8454,0.0058,0.0116,6.4675,1.6747,3.2345,5.2623,2.9413,1.6505,1.1469,1.1202,2.3999,0.2592,0.0033,0.6862,1.855,2.3409,4.3804,4.9466,5.4013,3.5554,1.0088,0.3373,7.1648,0.539,5.2485,0.0244,7.2142,1.0965,1.6952,4.7925,6.7917,7.6765,0.4167,0.7343,5.0016,3.3137,2.7561,0.6326,5.2107,0.1432,2.389,1.8923,1.3534,0.2825,2.5045,4.2292,2.4255,0.0215,0.0072,0.1111,4.0465,2.3369,5.5814,2.1166,1.5995,5.2943,0.869,2.9737,2.0324,1.8047,2.5138,4.2412,4.6666,3.4961,2.2369,0.0349,3.6944,0.2807,2.2229,0.0868,1.1922,1.4471,5.5775,1.5445,0.0055,0.0007,0.4286,2.3736,1.8096,0.5436,2.6652,2.831,3.6488,2.1709,7.1563,0.0076,3.1709,0.1029,0.8145,0.1955,0.592,4.4897,1.2266,1.8487,3.3839,3.1494,5.6065,5.3601,4.7048,0.0227,0.0563,1.591,1.5504,5.3507,4.4928,0.0055,0.0006,2.4613,1.9425,0.9395,0.2738,0.2409,4.0583,5.2974,1.2212,2.5276,2.7976,1.0642,1.1456,2.5011,1.4096,0.7584,1.0106,2.0835,2.4872,1.238,5.5798,5.4681,0.1318,3.1706,1.4176,0.001,0.0005,2.6671,2.1794,1.428,5.3263,0.0024,0.0045,1.214,0.1663,4.4222,0.8137,2.3499,3.7047,0.5839,0.6433,3.6099,1.2914,5.0794,1.9598,1.1338,2.9578,2.7598,0.0043,0.0066,2.8631,1.9755,4.5964,2.9296,2.3417,5.4554,4.2822,0.6183,3.0709,3.7452,1.6437,2.7444,1.9186,3.7669,2.2791,4.1711,5.2032,0.7016,4.9699,5.2306,2.9739,2.5297,4.6853,5.0125,4.1566,2.5772,2.9044,4.7519,2.7856,5.9964,4.0974,2.6516,1.4912,6.2367,1.9529,3.5959,1.9884,3.6847,3.9733,1.644,3.6184,2.529,0.9446,4.1166,2.5548,1.9449,1.3072,3.3999,0.0959,0.6896,1.2179,2.2716,0.0986,0.0259,1.0448]}

You can tell that story in the world, but you are still a character in a story that was not told in the story.\nHow can you \"tell\" that story?  If I did the story would the world be different if the characters were not aware of who you are, and where you are?\nThis whole argument is just based on your personality and how you act.  That being said, you play as a character who only happens to be aware of the events of the story that have had the opposite effect because everything else in the world is normal.  You may be a bit weird in other words but you are a character who just wants to live a typical character lifestyle.\nIt's more than that I'm telling you the plot is different because I can do that instead of pretending that there's nothing going on. That being said I still can't tell that story without the world being different because the world has had some events that have not been noticed.   So please calm your ass, I'm being genuinely confused.\nSo I'm just saying that the plot is different because I can do that more than anyone else in their day.  That you can't take it out on everyone because you can't know what's going on while playing the game of your life.  As much as I think you're right, most people can't tell either.\nYeah I completely agree.    I'm just saying the plot is different because I can't tell that world by the way. That's what makes the game different. They're not forcing you to find out what this world feels like, but to find the reasons you are doing it.    But I agree with what you said, but there is a difference between someone who thinks they see the world differently and someone who just sees it differently.","token_len":406,"entropy":[3.8828,2.7333,7.1872,1.8798,2.0391,2.5658,4.673,5.9551,5.0981,4.8459,0.2524,1.2623,2.8895,0.0782,1.9811,1.4863,1.802,2.2722,0.5732,0.5676,0.325,1.411,7.6858,10.3888,1.346,5.7797,1.1198,4.6191,1.8814,0.8543,0.6355,1.6489,0.86,0.7925,3.5951,3.3927,2.5116,1.9664,2.8254,1.7801,4.3073,2.2222,1.1564,0.9702,1.4375,3.2802,2.0979,0.387,0.6612,2.0905,0.1504,3.6805,4.5221,2.947,2.96,1.8964,0.4096,1.2415,0.4871,2.4949,7.5895,2.6378,0.8776,6.2511,2.3988,0.4318,2.2607,0.0951,0.9672,1.0844,4.3406,2.5873,5.7731,3.9853,2.3374,7.5112,4.1855,2.425,1.327,1.5145,3.1742,3.2468,1.7326,0.911,3.2472,4.3137,0.3802,3.998,2.289,0.65,2.7151,1.9351,4.2158,0.5088,0.8026,1.3381,1.971,3.8266,6.4383,5.956,1.0033,3.3818,4.7317,0.1245,3.7293,6.0291,2.0657,2.4372,0.3161,3.7461,1.0978,0.7285,3.87,4.6382,0.022,0.2219,2.3501,7.2547,3.8461,1.0629,0.4385,2.5324,5.1537,4.1242,0.0358,0.696,3.3,0.1017,2.0952,4.3566,1.5562,0.6429,0.4007,3.6726,4.5619,6.3429,2.7451,5.5663,0.5908,5.5685,7.2053,2.0582,2.1066,0.242,0.712,0.861,5.9191,0.4883,0.4891,1.7997,4.3205,1.7222,1.8548,4.5969,4.2326,2.4158,4.0985,4.7601,2.6032,1.0821,0.8112,2.2619,0.2871,1.3798,3.3521,4.4215,0.1588,4.1144,2.6724,6.61,4.9778,4.939,0.5878,1.7248,3.808,1.1923,5.2605,2.3808,1.2938,4.8323,2.0219,4.9813,0.5275,3.1257,6.4102,2.1472,3.2614,1.8723,1.71,3.9194,4.5467,1.8168,6.3327,0.3197,5.7808,1.717,3.1137,1.8474,1.6583,3.2916,0.0151,1.0611,5.5184,4.3128,0.0161,2.5856,3.8186,3.5549,1.3592,1.5361,2.4833,0.3662,3.1143,2.986,3.7556,0.9292,0.7764,2.2037,2.2645,0.8918,3.3847,4.5539,3.9373,3.7013,0.6271,2.2516,2.9377,1.1912,6.1365,1.7149,0.5836,4.9978,3.4522,5.5685,7.9156,2.7563,5.8738,2.301,2.1882,1.196,5.2976,7.5775,6.1807,1.0098,0.9815,3.0006,2.5382,1.6228,2.8648,1.5625,1.2343,2.7981,4.0534,1.1826,0.6031,0.616,1.636,0.6776,1.5968,0.502,4.957,2.3767,4.4422,0.5088,2.2142,8.0744,6.7192,1.6355,0.4084,3.1888,5.9251,1.2686,2.318,5.1571,2.1329,3.1618,0.56,3.213,2.3911,1.4385,2.5534,0.2416,4.9177,1.5329,1.2953,0.1819,0.2962,6.7341,4.5421,1.7378,0.9269,5.0618,4.0147,0.5921,0.3071,0.4943,5.8584,3.5349,0.0341,0.3853,3.7246,2.6329,1.8056,2.583,1.4932,5.7527,0.7058,2.8171,0.9528,1.8299,7.1478,2.1616,1.9792,5.9352,2.4563,7.1054,0.7926,1.1428,0.468,3.5318,2.7533,2.2284,2.0385,1.7419,0.5913,3.7394,2.3093,0.6596,0.1833,0.2405,0.7026,0.1328,2.289,2.1638,2.6603,4.7833,5.2724,3.1926,1.7455,2.7429,5.3176,1.2215,2.7918,2.2006,1.7362,1.0597,0.9823,0.6455,7.7965,2.2939,1.7932,6.6967,0.4115,0.2127,6.0989,0.9611,1.4088,5.8648,0.7701,5.6551,0.0146,1.9867,2.5579,4.7677,2.1629,4.1906,5.4436,2.5786,2.8369,4.0514,1.4979,0.4686,0.5061,1.6055,1.858,4.9881,1.9385,5.209,0.8248,3.782,0.6162,0.8251,2.0375,3.5953,3.7655,1.6901,1.3408,2.1589,0.8376,6.1509,0.6118,3.9929,1.3556,6.0021,1.5119,0.4782,1.4979,0.5227,0.2539,0.0614,3.0404,3.5396,0.9186,2.2212,0.2404]}

{"id":524,"ended":true,"length":391,"text":"Emotions have started manifesting themselves into living breathing lifeforms. Yours are in your kitchen right now. You have noticed the cold, gray, and cold air in the kitchen. Then, you watch the kids play together, and you realize how much time they spent in each other, how much fun their plays have been, and how much fun they are having every day.\n\nIt might be hard for you to keep working, and you might be looking to get back on track. At the end of the day, when all of this happens, you can try to make up for it. You only want to keep up with the kids, but the other children are doing so well because everything else is going as smoothly as they can. They really do not need any other help and are loving daily life.\n\nWhat you should do is make the changes you want to make. Even when you are struggling to do these changes, you are helping them through a process they may have been reluctant to do. They also need you to find that extra calm with your children. If you are struggling and having difficulty doing these, don\u2019t give yourself any more time to help them.\n\nSo what should you do? It is important that you get involved. Make as many changes as you can. When their day is over, you can call or email the mom at the office that is having these struggles and ask them to do the same. Call them on their days off when they are not working. Call and email them when they are busy at home. Call and email them when they are in school.\n\nHow do you think about these things?

{"id":857,"ended":true,"length":373,"text":"A trendy bar in Times Square is bombed. Alcoholics Anonymous claims responsibility.\n\nThe Daily Beast reports that the group says it has a member named Dennis \"Dennis the Menace\" Sarnoff who is now homeless.\n\nSarnoff, 33, who used \"A New Way to Live\" for drug deals and gambling addiction, told DailyMail.com he has bipolar disorder and believes he is in danger because of his recent bouts of anxiety. He and three of his female and five of his female members are seeking assistance from psychiatrists and therapists as part of a nationwide outreach effort. One member says she is the only one there who has managed not only to break free from alcohol addiction but to turn it into a mental health crisis. She was drinking at a Manhattan liquor store earlier in the week.\n\nThe New York Times also reports that the group has an anonymous person who is \"an alcoholic in need\" of support, which may include food and clothing. Sarnoff's attorney has said that he wanted to go to a psychiatric facility, or at least have a doctor check him and warn him that his health is deteriorating. His condition, as described by one anonymous caller, has gotten worse.\n\nNewly released drug data in February shows that marijuana addiction is increasing in New York. New York police say they've found at least 9,072 out of a total of 14,957 known cases of users who use marijuana -- for which they've reported more than 9,000 overdoses. The total number of people arrested in the state between 1999 and 2005 was roughly double the number from 1999. In the years after the drug bust in January of 2000, more than 60,000 people have had cannabis prescribed. The numbers are still so small but the growing popularity of marijuana has generated a boom in the drug business in New York.\n\nThe FBI said late Friday that it is asking anyone who could call Crime Stoppers now to contact a mobile hotline. Crime Stoppers gives anonymous tips to police agencies.","token_len":408,"entropy":[12.3945,5.8104,1.5682,7.2725,0.0004,3.4019,11.0691,2.7318,9.7857,3.3142,1.7101,6.4356,3.2653,0.8505,1.3432,0.0007,2.3876,5.4576,1.1628,1.4897,1.2252,1.8448,2.955,4.4974,1.0279,2.0452,3.7563,6.8166,2.0631,6.4417,3.6749,1.0916,0.4529,4.9563,3.5218,0.0113,0.0825,5.5325,5.4741,0.4759,1.642,1.964,3.8773,4.9005,0.6286,1.1956,0.0002,2.2376,0.0055,0.0028,2.1051,4.9442,0.0265,3.3783,4.7099,6.7738,5.8275,4.8363,3.4795,1.281,1.8985,0.671,3.5615,6.8903,5.4585,1.4201,5.3202,5.6555,0.2089,3.6384,4.5123,3.722,0.0113,0.0857,1.9323,2.9902,6.9348,0.0866,0.6912,5.2317,0.8575,1.8172,3.2363,2.3897,3.8488,0.7211,0.6356,5.8498,6.9455,0.1875,4.7335,0.5331,2.3681,4.9778,4.4923,3.1118,0.0238,6.5661,6.9335,3.471,4.1505,0.0502,5.6896,6.0288,1.3779,4.795,6.6655,1.5271,5.2226,1.5852,2.8973,4.4612,3.0367,0.0008,0.7729,3.0444,5.8192,1.5824,1.2852,5.856,3.2156,3.2949,2.1071,1.7896,5.0775,0.7877,1.0891,5.9063,1.8702,1.5038,4.4426,7.2077,2.9012,0.1,4.7701,0.7863,1.0024,5.397,2.2342,0.4685,1.0083,5.4081,2.6501,1.0939,0.6918,3.8414,0.1855,1.816,0.2164,3.3701,3.6532,7.4291,2.8517,1.3351,5.549,7.2807,0.094,4.8518,2.5776,0.1679,1.1166,1.1463,0.9656,0.0002,2.1208,3.7161,0.073,1.0674,4.017,0.5839,0.3087,1.7599,0.9588,1.8004,3.9543,4.2228,5.053,1.2122,2.5221,2.9362,4.2296,2.3966,4.2091,2.6239,2.7825,4.4898,3.5006,2.4528,3.9754,3.6214,2.7167,4.6659,1.2198,3.5828,0.5425,3.422,0.0046,0.0031,2.4331,4.8,3.2589,1.808,1.4056,1.3547,6.1014,0.481,4.5366,0.8811,1.982,3.3838,2.0379,2.7209,6.3164,2.3086,0.0679,3.3477,1.4324,4.5283,2.2603,0.9668,3.1004,6.0516,0.0687,1.6473,2.1046,3.9757,0.8361,2.0583,0.3118,4.7578,4.193,3.7385,3.8543,3.9138,0.5196,3.174,4.9537,4.5834,0.2098,2.3665,3.9331,0.483,1.0907,0.6761,0.0002,5.807,5.6151,1.0692,7.0621,3.6312,5.2572,5.0347,2.7921,0.4506,6.2241,5.8679,1.4043,4.2032,1.5923,2.0404,0.078,2.657,4.7789,0.293,3.8044,2.5619,1.4859,3.0093,3.323,3.3871,0.0013,4.9494,1.3355,5.9053,2.2893,7.7942,0.0157,3.0423,0.5182,0.5791,4.148,0.1242,3.1132,3.9958,5.5298,2.7207,0.3351,5.2301,2.029,2.1103,0.7368,6.9964,5.4743,3.9305,1.3137,2.1992,4.9586,3.4665,0.0711,3.9421,0.1617,0.9493,3.9501,0.5753,2.2861,5.0199,1.3202,0.2719,2.3162,3.0178,2.3085,1.6754,1.0581,6.2317,4.5237,0.0495,4.1003,0.9447,5.1249,3.6442,0.611,0.7701,4.2842,1.881,1.3436,3.3104,2.39,4.8191,2.2264,1.1191,3.0546,2.482,2.6775,4.0363,3.4085,4.2292,0.0985,3.3128,0.1826,4.3836,0.8074,0.0107,0.4408,4.3916,4.2757,5.3577,5.5785,2.0779,2.7543,3.5557,1.4617,3.6923,5.4325,2.3876,4.5991,2.2245,4.9981,3.5323,0.1915,1.3278,1.702,5.6929,1.569,4.878,0.2372,1.4523,2.9678,3.2519,2.2443,0.9497,0.006,1.0421,0.7926,0.0003,1.8341,5.8538,3.3191,6.6802,3.4222,0.3867,0.9842,2.1592,5.6782,2.8478,1.0445,5.0531,7.0616,5.2091,0.0528,0.0,6.5415,0.5577,2.4826,4.111,7.4321,4.1764,2.4042,5.3004,0.1575,0.0009,6.1069,3.2258,1.3272,1.1599,2.8474,4.3851,2.1657]}

In fact, we are at war, and this battle is not over.\"\n\nThe statement included a long list of demands including increased pressure on Beijing's \"toxic\" trade practices, more transparency on its abuses and more direct negotiations to end the trade war with the US.\n\nChinese officials said the letter from Trump amounted to a clear and unequivocal call to Trump to take steps to end the situation on Chinese territory, as well as to end the two arms trade disputes to which the US has repeatedly responded.\n\nChinese Vice Premier Yang Jiechi and Defense Minister Wang Yi were in Beijing on Tuesday to hold meetings for the first time in a year to review progress on a number of military issues related to China's alleged use of its technology against the US.","token_len":409,"entropy":[9.9428,10.7823,3.9762,3.7449,8.6854,5.9212,3.7697,3.7229,0.0027,5.9019,4.6351,15.0616,0.2579,0.4855,0.0006,2.7375,4.0841,4.5437,4.9595,3.073,3.1529,4.7655,9.1708,2.0633,3.0182,6.1651,4.6905,4.6486,1.6766,2.9715,6.8409,0.8326,2.0289,0.7917,4.0242,2.068,0.6137,2.7945,2.5982,1.4519,3.5017,1.012,4.7988,0.5291,5.0989,3.6734,3.607,4.7559,3.1791,7.0432,5.6007,2.9723,2.7508,1.9833,2.2596,2.2798,0.0701,1.2032,0.2846,0.3374,0.0002,1.8076,4.8424,2.2578,4.1548,6.0283,0.1692,3.5051,2.7848,1.1925,1.5115,1.6631,3.0363,8.3951,1.4804,5.9906,1.2678,4.8809,2.9882,0.9182,0.5846,0.5381,0.5527,1.7197,6.0225,1.0478,4.114,0.0023,0.1857,0.0282,0.0047,0.0116,4.1169,6.4514,3.0022,7.0816,1.5511,1.1279,5.6113,0.0038,0.5843,4.667,0.3126,0.8396,0.4504,1.5384,1.3845,0.582,2.8579,0.7409,0.2798,0.0003,4.3091,1.498,4.1952,2.5116,1.6427,5.664,0.0008,0.6933,4.1279,1.139,6.0182,5.2832,0.4595,0.002,0.0139,0.6942,3.2145,2.4119,2.3569,4.1673,3.4098,0.883,3.6651,4.4715,0.1427,0.4526,1.6674,0.0023,0.8212,2.7639,3.2348,2.9986,2.5271,3.326,5.7106,2.672,2.3114,3.5957,4.1655,1.4188,5.3019,4.2375,0.1546,1.9737,0.0046,1.0457,2.3878,4.9969,7.1182,3.6818,0.9602,4.7718,1.5127,0.1364,0.0003,2.505,6.5567,1.3524,2.2631,5.624,0.6533,0.5546,0.4584,1.9439,0.2595,3.7938,5.1456,5.8818,2.4786,0.0476,2.7367,2.5791,1.1857,2.0655,3.6676,4.6735,2.9743,0.8948,7.8259,0.0041,0.0972,1.1847,0.5916,5.4433,4.7202,0.1574,2.9025,3.6012,2.13,3.7888,7.0819,0.6473,2.5609,1.0901,0.9418,2.0818,5.204,5.1532,5.7986,1.8406,1.0656,4.2857,7.0091,4.129,6.1284,0.0378,0.5197,2.1373,0.9754,1.1439,2.6165,6.219,1.0292,1.8706,0.2273,0.0002,1.8508,2.3113,4.0422,0.652,4.4525,0.1453,3.8109,2.4553,4.7826,1.945,3.2535,0.0024,5.0701,3.7191,1.5003,2.1561,4.475,5.1365,0.2576,5.3541,3.585,0.1183,1.5979,5.2623,3.0893,4.2736,2.0926,0.0615,1.1326,1.1648,3.5011,1.7329,3.4877,0.6575,3.3951,4.5397,0.6914,2.2947,0.7519,1.3544,0.0682,0.0002,1.7026,5.3088,5.785,0.8467,6.0059,0.3335,0.0032,2.7804,3.3547,3.8703,5.6379,0.1436,2.5115,3.7853,3.2364,4.9768,0.1175,0.5755,0.2237,2.7925,0.9154,4.0436,2.7065,1.4761,1.8993,8.1496,1.6863,2.4851,4.8211,4.6304,3.2562,1.2657,0.6631,3.3538,2.1263,2.1457,0.3839,1.3845,0.299,0.1132,0.0002,4.8752,2.0355,2.6085,1.5257,2.0761,4.5471,1.3653,7.013,0.0042,0.8691,5.2962,3.4784,2.4718,0.0002,1.8319,1.1036,6.6665,0.2923,4.4455,3.3931,0.1811,1.7382,0.5065,7.4068,4.6878,4.7551,2.471,1.5624,3.3987,0.4108,0.0131,1.1084,2.3647,0.9314,5.9094,6.3023,1.8592,3.1597,6.0484,1.0629,1.2159,0.3958,1.2527,5.051,4.9611,0.4676,0.0962,0.0002,4.1208,4.8281,1.3812,4.5665,0.0675,0.1363,0.0024,4.2298,3.4667,0.3116,1.4739,0.0161,2.7402,2.4914,1.5738,1.2435,0.8086,1.0425,3.787,3.774,4.7148,1.244,1.5307,0.0238,2.2587,2.7238,0.83,1.5989,4.1781,5.5689,0.8745,2.315,5.343,0.0006,3.5405,2.1422,3.7081,0.0013,1.8418,0.6616,4.77,3.8924,0.0044,3.5517,7.6941,4.1378,0.7255,0.4501,0.5652]}

The other kids were brought to a school nearby. The Pashtuns are known to go to school in darkness but are not ashamed or concerned that the pashtuns are scared of children.\n\nAccording to the report, the children found out that there is no place for them where they live. As for them, there were only two bedrooms, a separate bathroom for the two children and another for the adults.\n\nPashtuns have always believed that Pashtuns do not belong as part of their community. They are considered an ethnic group. If they have never been in the village, they do nothing more out of passion than they do to protect the villagers who are part of their family.\n\nIt is reported that the families are working towards saving the children from the school. When asked, they told the police the police said the parents were working in the dark and they were not responsible for the police investigations into the matter. They also promised to find out who was responsible for the police investigation.

{"id":3679,"ended":true,"length":365,"text":"A Day in the Life of a Sociopathic Hitman\n\nThe book The Day in the Life of a Sociopathic Hitman tells the story of a young Hitman who has an early history of a serious breakdown of his personal convictions. As the world is consumed by radicalized communism, a new generation of politicians and the public are struggling to balance their personal and social agendas.\n\nPursuing the Right\n\nThis is a book for the middle-class, rich, and working-class. It is not for the middle-class, the privileged, or the powerless. To the left of this book is the very movement in favor of the state in the US. The movement to abolish government, capitalism, and socialism has become a radical movement \u2014 and an ideal of society.\n\nHere comes the real kicker: The book has been written specifically for the middle-class because it will do so much for the rest of us, all working-class and privileged people. Because the book will do so much for all these working class people, and for our privileged class, all working-class and privileged people, it\u2019s also a better book than the whole first edition of the book, The Day in the Life of a Sociopathic Hitman.\n\nWhy it\u2019s important to you\n\nThe book starts out with a story that is extremely compelling, and ends with a great introduction by a man who is far from being an idealist. But then, it gets to the core. He begins that book-turned-op-ed. There is no need to compare The Day in the Life of a Sociopathic Hitman with The Day in the Life of a Sociopath, either, but it shows this isn\u2019t some book about the end of a lifetime. If you think about what can be achieved when you look at different people around you, and focus only on the rich and privileged, it becomes clear why a book titled \u2018The Day in the Life of a Sociopathic Hitman\u2019 is so important.","token_len":410,"entropy":[9.3008,1.4967,0.8436,0.3696,0.7407,2.0538,7.4836,3.9168,9.5914,1.4406,0.0288,2.6139,5.1303,4.7367,3.796,0.637,0.0187,0.0028,0.0018,0.0229,0.0067,0.1148,0.0036,3.3509,0.2407,0.3788,0.0219,1.3597,3.4665,7.0411,0.8349,2.8005,4.8495,4.7042,5.1754,0.6766,5.201,4.6346,6.175,2.5988,1.2438,4.7813,8.0166,0.7731,3.4588,1.8112,3.9911,2.9392,5.4983,0.5206,7.7846,4.8089,7.3073,0.5013,2.2924,3.458,2.6648,0.3427,6.5847,1.4943,4.2769,4.1979,1.7774,5.4097,0.3703,4.6324,1.3081,3.4329,2.1508,2.8224,2.7131,0.3555,1.8061,0.0002,5.5462,5.4594,0.5876,1.3642,6.3705,3.6344,0.0002,3.5724,1.8911,0.926,2.3418,2.9421,1.9335,4.8474,1.9032,1.0981,1.8003,4.8173,0.9185,0.6117,3.6375,1.8068,0.0064,1.5027,1.1036,1.5745,2.7592,1.5669,0.5242,3.615,0.7237,0.1665,0.8767,2.6019,3.8642,0.2997,0.41,0.371,4.6467,0.3439,5.9348,2.5594,2.6389,0.945,2.1106,1.7146,0.9813,2.0092,5.131,6.0963,4.4747,5.0878,0.0039,2.5519,5.4679,4.6431,1.411,3.0206,0.943,2.0122,3.5962,3.5061,2.3475,3.4179,2.4369,4.9988,0.1721,0.5116,3.6886,2.4564,3.6394,1.3953,5.5264,1.9833,7.3795,2.1684,3.8985,5.2857,2.9683,5.865,1.027,0.8786,0.0002,6.5328,5.3137,0.946,3.5092,5.6879,1.1156,2.2053,1.5539,3.4897,1.7369,2.5665,5.3556,0.4736,0.8727,1.5639,0.5505,0.0784,5.6444,0.9524,3.8213,5.717,3.1332,1.5024,1.3584,0.9605,5.1486,0.0216,0.3932,2.3216,4.9781,4.5726,1.038,0.035,2.1039,4.6401,2.6786,0.8488,5.27,2.1621,1.4989,1.6546,2.4899,0.3821,0.1761,0.3172,2.9418,5.7387,2.792,3.3102,0.7763,0.8825,2.6455,1.9424,4.0954,6.2756,2.9298,1.1136,3.9198,1.07,0.1737,0.003,1.1049,0.5909,0.1069,1.4026,1.5957,18.0915,8.3748,1.7165,4.3197,1.5885,5.8154,0.5335,1.1058,1.4812,6.4462,6.5533,2.0725,1.4276,2.0612,1.0666,1.9139,3.3534,2.1194,0.0642,0.0084,0.0031,0.0053,0.0778,0.0118,0.4116,0.0065,0.3311,0.4442,0.0002,4.7979,3.7482,5.471,0.3507,0.0131,4.4932,2.4023,3.4626,0.5586,0.0001,1.6726,1.2756,5.1123,1.7986,1.0016,0.7544,3.786,2.2268,1.756,4.6109,3.7732,1.5224,1.4661,4.0074,0.3708,0.5401,3.4353,5.6915,1.8584,1.9569,3.4262,0.8449,1.7184,6.5133,1.2532,2.2225,1.7785,3.0236,1.7223,0.6332,3.1042,3.2605,1.585,2.7928,2.927,2.293,0.5284,3.7191,3.7555,2.8698,3.8477,6.4625,4.3945,8.6973,5.1208,0.0183,6.241,3.2527,1.5392,3.8265,4.7941,0.778,2.0394,3.8765,0.2603,6.554,3.9243,0.2967,0.0188,0.0038,0.0014,0.0015,0.0044,0.0027,0.1426,0.0025,0.8443,1.4256,3.0011,0.0983,0.0433,0.11,0.0038,0.5465,0.6622,1.2708,1.6927,4.952,2.0469,3.3974,2.7831,5.5993,5.6094,5.3664,1.3556,0.607,0.1248,5.5505,4.7159,1.992,2.1461,5.3266,0.2081,2.1208,5.5274,0.904,4.802,0.516,3.8824,1.3798,3.9169,5.509,0.8085,1.6576,3.3184,0.9021,3.7669,0.5595,7.5191,1.9896,5.7746,0.1221,0.4956,2.3566,6.7384,2.6941,0.029,1.4126,5.1609,0.6587,2.1737,0.4233,2.608,3.1593,1.4348,2.6702,4.9255,0.9988,6.2667,9.9073,6.7925,2.2103,0.4083,0.0152,0.0052,0.0038,0.0005,0.0055,0.0036,0.9283,0.0055,0.7531,0.4777,0.9615,1.6215,0.3608,0.4998]}

It speaks to the social and political issues at the heart of the Soviet Union, the post-war period in which many Soviet prisoners were imprisoned, and the struggles of our era.\n\nThe collection includes oral histories, memoirs, and photographs depicting visits to Vigovia Prison, including Soviet prisoners of war, as well as the photographs of prisoners from Vigovia Prison in 1939 as well as their personal accounts of prisoners' personal lives in other prisons and prisons at Vigovia Prison.\n\nThe book discusses the \"two-sided\" relationship between SS agents in the Vigovia prison and prisoners in the Soviet Union, which may have been more closely associated with the Soviet Union than with the United States. The authors describe these conversations as being \"personal and intimate details of personal life and work.\" They discuss their experiences in prison, how they have been able to relate to one another and the experiences they have had while incarcerated in Vigovia Prison.\n\nThe novel is illustrated in both black and white photographs, with black backgrounds showing prisoners' personal faces on a black background while pictures of prisoners from Vigovia Prison, including Soviet prisoners of war, are shown on white backgrounds.\n\nOther publications\n\n - Soviet-Soviet Friendship (1947), by Ciar\u00e1n Leitrim.\n - The Second Polish War, by Ciar\u00e1n Leitrim.

{"id":156,"ended":false,"length":407,"text":"Archie finally decides and settles down with either Betty or Veronica, and then, when Betty sees Archie, she decides she can't just take him, or leave him, but get together and put a stop to it. It's pretty damn cool, and that's what I really thought.\nOh yes I did think about what Betty might be doing but the ending has me a little depressed :D I was looking forward to this moment.\nI am sad to say I didn't watch it and was really hoping it was finished...then again I didn't really catch any of the plots from this series but the plot was very strong and very moving.\nI read a few issues as to why people wanted Veronica but you definitely need to take it with a grain of salt. I thought a lot of people were okay with that but I had hoped it was over the top (I felt like it was) and she ended up being a very strange woman. That being said I still loved the ending that was given with the exception that Archie could have lived and not only that but he did and I also found the whole show pretty entertaining. I'm still laughing about me and the first season just saying \"Honey, do you have any idea I have?\" (It was awesome)\nIf you're a fan of Archie, this story is a good one. It's a fantastic one that is fun and gripping and it's almost all about Archie turning back time to see what would happen when he finds his sister. I really enjoyed reading the end and then a few issues later, I saw that Archie finally decided to settle down and now she is with Archie, and the two of them go on adventures in the woods and meet him. I'm so sure it will be the end of a great series.\nI had no idea about that. And I'm glad there is a sequel to this series.\nI love it too it's still fresh in my brain. It hasn't changed that much so I just want to be able to play it again :D","token_len":414,"entropy":[10.5714,9.7699,5.603,6.5596,7.2031,2.1952,1.6825,9.2957,6.7527,0.2708,3.9979,1.7432,2.2747,2.9256,3.7212,3.0335,2.3625,5.4574,3.7088,2.1417,0.6735,3.5386,3.0889,2.6622,0.7705,4.271,3.9089,2.1642,2.9627,3.5744,4.0664,0.2626,2.5868,3.7633,5.1969,5.2605,1.9491,5.2272,3.176,1.313,0.0164,1.5277,0.3808,3.743,0.6631,4.6314,4.1112,2.8099,1.5245,1.5953,3.6953,0.5481,1.5099,2.221,3.6988,5.9775,2.1027,0.8898,10.2442,5.4339,5.1315,1.8422,4.007,2.786,5.1469,3.9698,3.0078,2.0732,2.4176,6.3767,4.2524,4.7916,4.4064,2.717,5.1284,0.4207,5.2735,8.0495,1.5647,2.8776,3.1427,4.5137,0.6844,0.0259,2.1555,4.4694,2.6024,1.3917,2.0471,4.0546,5.5113,1.0508,0.5679,1.955,3.1139,0.0005,3.8966,2.2032,3.8274,3.3133,3.2643,3.2211,1.8604,2.1452,6.0025,6.5187,7.2978,3.119,1.1099,3.0483,0.0005,2.8419,5.9821,3.9501,0.3546,0.3836,7.8843,3.8652,2.817,2.6545,3.4635,3.227,3.3965,1.8948,3.7459,3.9738,1.157,4.1404,4.278,0.7214,1.5441,1.6505,5.2986,2.1649,2.2348,5.3194,5.316,3.2936,1.1703,5.3007,4.0146,4.1413,4.7314,6.0658,6.0535,4.0116,0.2095,4.3244,2.9708,1.441,0.0827,0.0927,0.0043,0.0002,0.9199,1.6255,3.8686,4.2952,0.5671,0.4535,2.3442,1.5768,6.7219,0.1014,2.2164,1.5664,0.9319,4.128,5.5388,2.5091,2.1095,3.9684,2.8325,0.8315,5.1184,2.4242,5.1767,1.1115,2.1283,0.4606,2.6887,1.122,5.5373,4.3478,0.0318,1.1585,1.5477,3.1501,6.107,3.0769,1.1579,4.3317,3.5583,0.0082,1.8063,3.3034,3.0907,1.4655,2.5642,4.9949,2.5907,2.1705,4.9838,1.54,4.8875,3.7683,3.9144,5.3589,2.0492,5.669,2.8659,4.8765,5.5533,4.1723,0.4407,1.7993,3.3775,4.2227,2.6331,4.7633,4.1948,2.041,3.4703,4.1931,3.633,3.727,0.7603,1.8051,2.608,3.068,6.4287,3.1246,7.9793,3.1103,2.8402,5.8021,3.3086,4.8915,9.109,1.366,5.6388,3.7837,0.6391,4.8119,0.3593,2.8732,1.4744,2.2979,7.0134,3.3633,4.447,4.3532,4.3558,1.2129,4.759,1.6815,1.1331,4.4208,0.3766,2.1873,2.2561,0.6585,0.0789,2.1247,2.4688,2.9738,4.283,1.1001,2.5887,2.7653,0.8142,1.2554,2.0768,0.757,1.621,4.91,2.7269,2.367,3.2246,4.4685,1.8092,6.5677,1.202,2.2593,0.9311,6.1706,4.2197,1.1309,2.3783,8.2212,5.253,1.0027,2.2663,3.0256,1.843,5.1521,1.2478,3.2079,0.5576,4.3425,2.0944,3.6797,1.1408,1.639,3.0661,1.1924,2.2083,1.8145,4.9996,2.2417,5.6064,5.3481,1.2488,2.6291,1.4532,2.6188,1.5085,4.8395,1.9774,3.4708,4.8656,3.5774,0.6418,5.7463,0.3142,1.2051,5.3152,3.2162,2.2207,3.4972,2.4894,2.1462,1.4624,3.464,2.6069,0.5582,0.0321,3.1618,1.3887,3.7136,3.8326,1.3738,2.8154,2.0859,4.0649,6.9064,1.2484,1.6576,2.1722,2.9656,6.7166,2.594,1.4975,0.3825,3.2348,2.052,0.6248,3.8491,2.3192,1.1453,1.5391,0.724,1.7749,4.6145,2.9494,0.1651,3.4543,3.8732,3.3303,4.8117,1.2686,2.0181,2.0355,4.2116,1.9516,1.4245,2.1825,1.7029,1.0227,1.4704,1.4397,1.6696,1.6313,2.9861,3.0835,4.6866,6.288,0.6253,4.9648,4.6873,1.9004,0.1867,3.4715,1.3132,2.4069,6.9576,0.0004,3.068,3.7475,0.0443,3.9331,0.9278,3.5272,3.0052,0.2484,3.4029,1.801,0.002,5.2712,1.8661,1.2925,6.4191,0.3048]}

My work is very much inspired by the mountains and the mountain.\u2019\n\nSeebach was born in Krak\u00f3w in 1977 and was already a student at the University of Otaku.\n\n\u2018A lot of people don\u2019t understand that if you can create a mountain-type painting, it really would work,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s quite difficult to do with traditional techniques, but it was amazing to see how well it worked.\u2019","token_len":415,"entropy":[9.0825,2.561,4.1105,7.7454,2.7413,6.5354,4.1995,1.8403,0.6733,4.0966,6.7562,5.3439,0.7364,3.7028,3.7226,4.3817,0.9278,9.6066,3.9337,3.5862,4.3405,5.8972,1.5268,3.0427,1.7382,10.9088,0.4669,1.3002,0.2094,0.9495,4.5992,0.6536,1.8092,0.001,2.3488,4.2169,6.8776,0.7224,1.9315,1.7705,4.6935,2.7109,4.8897,0.3061,1.4499,0.3907,0.4072,2.4181,2.1752,2.7614,0.0386,1.9603,1.0857,0.8091,1.2918,2.478,1.9943,4.1486,2.8801,4.8244,2.1469,4.8006,1.3184,1.2377,0.0002,6.6974,2.758,8.6936,0.2814,0.9966,7.364,2.5439,3.501,0.7186,3.99,0.3833,0.0177,6.5925,4.8785,8.066,5.6346,5.7262,4.3289,1.9472,2.8435,6.6646,3.4394,0.8791,2.2419,3.0209,6.1593,0.8317,8.5624,2.7599,3.8205,0.2342,0.0001,10.1528,8.5765,6.9039,4.6382,3.6382,6.4749,2.2506,0.0454,2.2438,5.7966,4.8379,0.8602,0.0001,2.5753,1.6349,2.9567,1.5518,5.0836,1.8947,2.1461,3.4921,4.6851,3.9857,3.232,11.9921,1.0942,4.2894,4.4199,0.2371,0.317,0.2003,3.2558,2.5587,6.0252,0.053,0.2637,1.9394,0.5293,1.7546,1.9864,0.0005,0.0729,0.0012,0.0014,1.003,0.8494,0.0002,7.7104,19.6661,2.9636,5.5041,6.6776,1.3646,0.862,0.1234,0.4518,3.912,1.068,1.8933,0.0128,2.6269,1.146,1.7346,0.73,0.0002,5.781,1.8909,4.2995,6.881,4.6101,3.9777,0.0104,0.0436,0.0879,0.0963,0.7271,2.5927,2.3384,2.9041,2.6314,4.8564,2.9719,3.6796,2.1302,0.6786,5.0234,0.1575,3.3976,0.1057,1.779,0.0011,1.8725,4.9163,4.0337,5.8882,2.6294,5.5032,2.7197,3.5592,3.7581,1.1698,0.0939,0.0003,5.2021,0.0233,2.0959,1.775,4.7697,2.8296,1.4724,3.4022,4.2106,0.6439,1.2219,2.8576,2.7819,0.8476,1.2465,0.2874,2.2489,5.9159,4.6052,0.7109,0.9097,3.2116,8.0197,4.338,1.1221,9.5229,0.1154,1.6977,2.4573,8.4942,0.016,5.3814,7.8423,5.9079,3.1219,6.2696,3.3424,2.5171,5.7695,0.3917,2.0184,1.2416,0.2101,0.0002,1.1749,0.0507,1.4814,6.4025,1.2196,0.675,0.0606,0.0895,0.0579,9.2603,1.4543,1.4044,0.4568,5.0143,2.6055,4.2155,1.2891,0.7641,4.3675,0.1008,4.5783,1.5401,3.2532,1.1936,2.8181,4.4574,0.3455,1.3471,2.8096,1.8624,2.4303,2.2791,9.4378,0.0079,0.001,1.9188,0.2166,0.1692,0.0002,0.6462,0.0517,3.6989,9.9587,1.2069,2.4014,4.9011,0.1561,0.433,0.7625,0.6357,2.7764,1.0419,0.1581,0.0411,4.6417,3.3638,5.0554,2.5114,6.2783,4.5164,6.519,7.4185,6.4994,5.6447,7.3289,5.5651,1.621,3.7751,1.2289,4.4512,0.7029,0.7994,3.8013,3.4788,2.1939,0.0607,1.1708,4.2777,1.8143,1.2233,4.7467,2.3555,2.0535,0.1729,0.7466,0.0002,3.5231,0.0226,3.1717,1.1101,0.2911,3.9662,4.8342,1.9777,0.0038,1.916,5.5209,1.0519,3.4893,6.9864,1.5656,2.6956,0.5827,0.8522,0.7162,0.0181,4.2951,2.7755,3.3941,0.8603,0.0002,1.2322,0.0477,4.6164,2.6264,0.0866,0.7998,3.4262,2.3605,1.6283,0.8566,1.9318,2.0577,5.1523,0.7104,3.4767,2.7887,1.6006,3.3451,2.823,6.0101,2.6323,0.7616,1.9837,5.1655,7.4245,3.715,2.7673,0.2422,0.1667,1.0772,0.3099,0.0579,4.0751,0.5527,2.1103,2.4615,0.0646,0.0409,4.4461,2.185,0.7998,1.669,4.1171,4.2975,1.6805,1.3767,2.1727,1.917,3.9044,5.8632,0.7136,0.8251,1.5558,2.4214,1.1825,1.3969,0.8462,1.1083,0.0343]}
{"id":2949,"ended":true,"length":391,"text":"You are a NASA scientist with the budget of the U.S. Military.  NASA spent money to do research that I doubt anybody in the military can do.\nBecause the budget of the U.S. Military has exceeded the budget of NASA by billions of dollars?!?  \"I doubt any people in the military can do\" is what NASA scientists write.  You got to be crazy to believe that.  They spend money on this stuff.  They aren't even sure if they can use it.  And it is not like they are flying around the planet searching for any aliens if they had any idea what the term aliens was.\nSo because NASA spends more money per unit of crew to study and develop than the Department of Defense or the Pentagon (which is responsible for space exploration), they are not going to spend more on research?  I don't know what is the argument that is made against that, but I think there may have been more merit to it. I agree that the money they spend on space exploration is a small part of it.\nYes, they want to do work that would be difficult and expensive if the human being could not complete.   I don't know what the argument is for spending more money on space exploration...\nIt is not an argument at all.  Its a case of the lack of research that is expensive.  If we want to do scientific work we need research on earth and not something for which our space research is very expensive.  I'm not saying that the problem could not be solved (although the problem was not solved in the first place).  I'm sure the problem is still there though.\nThat's why you're making such a dumb argument.  Science isn't cheap, it has a huge cost.  Plus science is what makes our lives fun.\nIf we look at science as anything other than research of humans on earth, the answer to it seems to be a resounding no.\n\"We know what to do.\" Doesn't make it even remotely possible.","token_len":416,"entropy":[3.8828,2.7333,8.9116,2.8963,3.7616,2.2035,9.26,1.5913,3.4245,2.8364,0.0174,0.0287,0.0844,6.0571,1.4128,8.3935,11.4019,7.1741,6.7665,1.6055,4.5575,2.4037,3.2934,4.1508,6.5303,4.3722,2.4167,0.7175,2.2625,4.1603,1.2775,0.8376,3.149,9.943,2.8596,4.8059,1.6573,0.7398,1.1866,0.0005,0.0017,0.0027,0.7281,2.9624,5.136,1.6053,1.1799,0.1194,1.7473,4.4051,4.6428,0.5665,0.0143,10.452,3.6933,2.8387,8.8062,3.1928,4.5943,3.0715,5.5673,0.3465,0.1154,0.1208,0.8149,0.3643,3.8159,2.0614,2.4615,2.8037,4.6381,5.5918,1.78,1.511,5.0789,6.4647,2.7178,1.8861,4.5183,0.753,1.7171,0.7068,2.1136,1.2312,4.4939,4.2466,2.297,1.4902,5.0674,2.3947,1.0915,0.9684,2.2278,5.9834,0.0016,2.7219,4.1646,1.9825,0.9473,1.4389,4.6098,0.6386,0.8037,0.6342,2.9915,3.2318,1.8787,2.3708,2.662,1.2678,1.9222,6.7115,3.0216,2.3374,2.674,5.3124,0.0407,4.4223,3.8456,6.9786,0.59,5.8569,3.6459,2.8065,1.4247,2.6205,6.6621,1.9219,2.0416,0.5992,1.7615,2.8609,7.0255,1.1832,2.6295,3.3215,0.5924,4.5857,3.8016,0.4544,5.5274,4.2074,3.361,3.0676,2.6251,3.9775,2.4143,5.4818,0.0155,0.1208,3.3574,1.0858,2.8346,4.1078,1.8952,1.8314,5.1587,0.0179,6.1716,1.6808,1.1087,2.0659,1.5229,2.6848,2.1951,0.0304,2.4723,2.0472,1.59,2.2073,4.9793,0.2532,3.1425,2.1738,0.0018,1.0161,1.8939,3.3399,2.3467,6.1952,2.304,3.2757,3.0139,3.4437,2.5348,2.5116,0.6507,1.5417,2.0969,3.1865,5.014,3.2878,0.0921,3.7153,8.9453,0.6382,1.5186,0.9359,4.0137,5.5215,1.3967,1.8819,4.2658,3.7458,0.5234,1.1232,2.461,0.4969,0.606,2.6991,3.6868,1.9381,0.0352,2.5557,0.831,2.6775,6.0998,0.3024,2.8217,5.3567,0.3508,2.4971,7.3331,1.3465,3.1113,1.4771,3.7386,2.6517,1.0561,3.9288,3.0014,4.9403,5.9,2.4791,1.4767,6.8078,2.3036,0.3917,5.8119,2.6007,1.9951,0.0014,1.4036,1.6946,1.8717,1.8517,0.5547,1.8957,3.521,1.2083,0.6521,0.7814,1.4077,0.1754,6.605,2.1863,4.345,0.9945,2.1445,4.0363,0.3583,4.6575,0.013,0.6755,0.4511,5.9681,2.0694,4.731,0.2059,2.8014,6.6876,0.0438,4.9485,2.4681,1.7184,6.8397,1.2715,0.5798,3.9792,2.838,2.581,0.1945,1.8888,4.9018,1.9277,2.3468,1.0129,3.7938,4.3131,5.6304,2.3801,2.9527,5.9125,5.5876,2.0209,4.3467,5.0489,5.0352,0.9288,5.1121,0.7739,0.2394,0.5694,2.6909,3.5891,0.73,1.1342,0.6405,2.3204,6.1821,6.4524,1.3909,0.4169,0.3613,5.2258,2.7478,3.121,2.3796,3.8282,2.9117,1.0667,2.5431,0.8099,1.7968,0.003,1.2405,0.1596,1.7301,1.1404,4.9925,2.6037,2.0487,1.5511,3.8943,0.3203,5.5553,0.408,1.1161,4.4343,1.814,1.4736,3.2524,3.6649,4.8859,3.1844,0.7084,5.5216,0.9539,0.8168,0.4488,5.8916,3.4707,0.0015,3.6776,2.1824,1.1691,4.4567,2.4731,2.7308,2.1461,0.8685,0.2297,7.4021,4.6925,0.9045,5.2068,1.722,3.1897,2.2471,5.1156,0.7455,2.3748,3.3974,1.8725,4.6508,0.1791,3.9473,1.8897,5.8218,1.1724,0.0044,4.2117,5.9578,4.0288,4.2494,1.3417,0.6153,3.1397,3.2112,2.1677,5.363,4.434,0.6677,0.0717,3.6638,3.9986,0.0429,1.9268,0.145,2.673,5.2921,3.1454,3.7566,2.7881,5.0033,0.2322,3.0828,8.3173,0.0008,3.4212,2.6548,5.2169,3.3597,2.9366,1.1411]}

I think there are some really awesome space-dwarf-related planets out there! :D\n\nI am sure it will still be a fun game! :D","token_len":416,"entropy":[3.7806,3.6719,0.15,5.2201,0.9309,5.274,7.3252,13.2657,14.0019,0.2614,2.6348,5.0838,2.3815,5.8241,9.0484,3.4259,16.7179,5.3098,1.9433,2.8195,3.0341,1.4027,7.6875,0.7691,3.2749,8.235,10.2307,4.9654,1.6221,4.114,2.5319,0.0046,9.7547,2.286,2.853,0.227,2.2411,0.1933,3.358,1.0629,2.0445,1.1895,1.0908,4.2866,3.7347,3.3465,4.8406,6.8001,4.9478,1.1446,6.3443,2.5734,0.9272,0.0005,5.1701,0.7186,4.237,4.0347,7.2054,3.3248,2.9276,2.7088,2.5108,5.5537,0.2283,1.6897,4.1752,0.288,4.5798,3.2669,2.6802,1.1491,1.9017,2.6758,0.0081,2.0988,4.6431,2.2805,4.5903,5.6473,3.2897,2.9154,0.5573,4.6105,5.7953,2.6629,5.9393,6.3818,4.6282,3.3197,0.0003,4.0043,4.5733,1.9483,5.8183,1.7139,5.8564,0.766,3.9281,3.3296,2.5343,4.1593,1.1407,5.1514,2.3656,1.2817,0.0002,4.6804,5.4152,5.4356,2.1895,5.0369,3.943,0.703,3.7132,1.7494,2.2201,0.0004,3.0161,3.775,1.2051,3.5258,1.7061,1.5696,5.9546,0.6422,1.1797,3.821,3.4365,2.1003,4.2863,4.2846,1.0179,5.8627,1.3505,4.3514,4.8619,0.2021,0.0005,0.3372,3.0656,4.7268,1.7267,2.2015,0.4625,0.0003,4.1954,2.8788,0.1821,0.9656,0.1167,3.1057,1.7303,0.9768,4.7074,0.923,4.4289,4.1212,4.3342,5.5323,5.7397,0.0399,3.1796,0.4816,2.8095,0.3785,1.5164,0.762,3.0487,2.009,2.5712,1.7683,6.5956,0.3843,0.3624,0.0043,3.4408,0.0285,1.1119,0.0004,5.3401,4.0944,2.0188,0.5208,0.1466,2.0418,6.1678,1.9381,0.4025,0.0165,1.7404,3.941,0.2594,2.5395,4.4114,2.2101,2.9866,0.9173,0.3702,0.413,5.0107,0.9292,3.3918,1.9463,1.3775,2.2844,0.596,2.4759,4.7218,4.4459,2.8672,0.9458,1.4938,0.5351,0.9976,0.7044,0.0002,5.6343,6.5839,0.8574,0.3754,0.8525,5.6979,2.521,1.5428,2.4697,2.4008,5.6422,4.2674,0.9842,0.3944,5.5465,3.9727,1.5007,4.1254,2.8113,6.3944,4.0399,0.4257,1.9714,0.74,3.0857,0.4705,0.1281,0.5514,2.317,0.3601,4.7603,0.823,1.4958,2.2156,3.2235,2.7594,2.7403,3.8267,0.4476,4.0714,1.5776,0.195,2.1151,1.2764,2.7323,3.2938,1.1012,0.5788,0.6942,3.6487,0.9498,10.4441,1.2235,0.0801,1.0118,5.9015,0.4762,0.0002,3.363,0.9275,3.3329,2.5017,0.6778,0.6536,1.4843,0.5237,1.0572,0.2396,0.8084,0.0956,0.0738,0.0022,7.3759,6.8286,3.803,2.2345,3.1644,1.8412,0.9675,0.7244,1.1998,0.3214,0.3441,0.0053,6.8643,7.3765,3.5359,0.2617,1.2273,6.1715,0.7757,5.2683,0.921,3.9256,1.0936,0.0003,3.6347,3.3791,4.7845,3.4926,1.0535,4.2206,0.6306,2.5556,5.5527,2.5313,6.6403,6.0164,5.6857,5.6877,0.297,2.5252,6.2568,0.454,0.8587,7.3667,0.549,0.069,0.4198,6.3034,7.6854,0.6468,0.1996,0.4192,1.0106,2.551,8.2479,6.1499,3.5155,4.0583,3.7673,0.0795,0.5131,0.0003,4.402,0.8446,2.0189,1.4009,1.1827,0.693,1.7891,5.3739,0.4104,6.0578,2.5091,0.5035,0.0003,5.3718,2.8901,0.5089,5.3618,2.9549,1.127,4.4724,1.2689,2.4868,1.3242,2.6903,4.5896,4.1815,0.6058,1.0111,1.9575,3.5944,2.3866,2.927,1.0931,2.0577,4.6959,3.8501,5.1794,2.4819,3.409,3.1634,0.5509,3.2214,4.6745,2.0576,2.3828,0.0138,2.8703,1.8167,0.1613,0.4998,0.0003,2.5201,3.3097,2.2756,3.4323,1.5519,4.3433,0.2285,1.694,3.2915,1.5585,3.0987,1.4151,0.0793]}

Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [ WP ]\nI don't think I recall Magic being Hereditary in a long time.\nYeah, I didn't recall it, didn't think of that. There are quite a few stories from when I was in high school, but they were more like \"The Fire Witch is the Sum of her parents\" tales than Magic stories, so they'd be something like Harry and Ginny.\nI remember one of my friends telling me that it was one of the first \"magic stories\", only two years old! And then the teacher (one of the most notable teacher I had) gave her a wizard's license to use magic to help those he wasn't familiar with. The other was a wizard named \"Beth.\"  I thought a fairytale about \"the Fire Witch\" might be in order for Hermione to do magic because she was in love with both of those.\nOh yeah, I remember. I also remember that the father was a teacher with a wand. And the son has had some magical powers for years. I think that was the first one he ever used, but it was only briefly :o\nI just remember them saying, \"this is what we call Harry Potter...

And then the teacher (one of the most notable teacher I had) gave her a wizard's license to use magic to help those he wasn't familiar with. The other was a wizard named \"Beth.\"  I thought a fairytale about \"the Fire Witch\" might be in order for Hermione to do magic because she was in love with both of those.\nOh yeah, I remember. I also remember that the father was a teacher with a wand. And the son has had some magical powers for years.

{"id":1597,"ended":true,"length":395,"text":"In their desperation to end the war, the Allies airdropped an actual fat man and little boy onto Japanese soil.\nI don't think the US is really helping anybody in a war against Germany anyway, so why bother?\nbecause, unlike Germany, they have an army on its doorstep, and they're only going \"to fight back\"?\nOh, I did assume the US was helping Germany.   My issue is that they are going to continue to be the target of the Germans for as long as they can. If and when war comes, there'll be no military solution to how Germany is now.\nSo the Allies (i.e. the US soldiers) will be on their own dime?\nNo.  If not, there will be some one in charge of the conflict who will find an excuse to get the whole \"they'll get out\" shit together, and send in the troops as is (I understand Germany will do that, though I think there may be a more reasonable reason for that).    I've been really bothered about that.\nI mean, that's only what they want to do. They're trying to take away German money, which means they can't afford the army of their enemies. They'd be doing well to use that money to get out the guns, because that money would then be spent on defending the Allies.   So I guess there's a moral dilemma right there: they're going to need extra troops, but also they're going to need to build a new army for the Germans to attack and defend the Allied countries (such as Japan).\nI don't think these would be the worst things the US could do right now.\nWell, I don't think they're going to do anything else, so if the U.S. goes along with all this we would end up with some really bad results like the current 'war on terror'.  The only time they could do anything was to try to help Germany, so no.\nEven Germany would get to do nothing.","token_len":418,"entropy":[5.8871,7.5289,0.6815,5.8023,0.8698,1.808,0.4742,1.1799,4.0727,9.1347,2.9819,0.0572,0.0161,3.9873,7.1359,9.5753,5.0025,3.2685,8.5319,1.5799,5.4473,8.0761,2.5559,1.0756,1.8652,8.9674,3.2092,0.0007,1.9609,2.293,4.6467,3.4467,3.8383,5.9676,4.5323,2.3752,4.446,1.6712,3.8599,4.4901,6.4748,1.3316,2.8358,2.6642,3.0904,1.6022,1.3813,11.2237,3.9303,5.2584,3.629,0.3054,2.6076,2.5714,3.7976,2.0706,4.7981,4.8178,2.9258,2.0073,1.0647,1.6534,1.6974,4.765,2.0178,8.7076,2.3632,2.5399,3.3409,3.6867,0.6483,4.7859,0.6125,2.9263,6.2395,8.0734,2.3705,1.3708,1.4768,3.4791,2.8505,1.7699,5.5875,5.5306,7.498,7.5626,1.3485,0.8958,2.3065,2.5362,4.0637,0.3904,4.6002,0.8002,3.4579,2.1962,5.2252,0.47,2.6809,3.0427,3.1276,3.588,0.0113,0.0078,0.7858,0.9956,1.3128,4.2387,7.0491,0.026,5.6613,2.8258,0.718,3.8909,3.5261,0.2044,0.9947,5.063,2.0181,1.5592,6.9547,4.4143,1.5995,4.6914,1.5673,1.4524,2.8871,3.0402,3.0303,5.8462,6.3039,0.1317,0.0005,0.8865,0.8686,1.2201,7.7235,0.8917,2.113,2.3292,4.0851,0.9253,0.7313,6.7244,3.8381,0.9759,2.662,1.1883,1.6704,6.311,5.3198,0.2989,3.4513,1.0287,0.2245,4.0626,5.8741,3.8535,0.8278,1.0631,1.1516,6.8752,1.8916,0.5591,6.2924,4.0096,2.072,0.387,3.9506,2.5027,4.0049,4.8441,5.1587,3.297,3.9452,3.6605,1.751,5.3087,4.7682,2.4537,0.9283,5.8971,2.247,1.2416,3.7691,4.1656,6.8247,4.2329,3.9712,5.6455,5.4932,3.2428,3.8232,2.0041,1.1674,4.334,2.05,3.1383,3.5912,3.5642,0.3845,1.8457,4.018,4.0418,3.2249,1.3719,1.9639,1.1917,1.5831,1.7841,2.6801,3.0574,3.7975,2.3044,5.9921,4.5039,3.4533,2.4741,2.2808,1.2435,2.4143,3.2409,0.2253,4.0439,0.6772,5.6534,4.1954,2.4008,2.9937,1.4692,0.528,0.8508,2.8142,1.9735,2.8231,0.0535,3.6921,4.1965,4.5978,4.2331,1.2452,2.6464,2.6118,1.1665,2.5763,0.8428,2.9767,2.2898,4.6558,4.73,3.0186,3.8186,0.8568,3.4207,4.5106,2.1252,3.9066,5.3372,1.2309,4.8495,1.7482,0.43,0.7439,3.2882,2.8772,2.3091,5.4959,1.4387,3.5667,2.3462,4.1307,2.0623,3.9727,0.9843,3.2538,0.6484,5.9332,1.1976,3.7157,1.198,1.2498,0.3315,3.4628,2.9958,1.8629,3.3905,0.5972,1.9178,5.2078,2.939,7.386,0.167,2.9457,3.1251,1.5548,1.1662,0.0181,4.2947,6.7993,2.3379,1.619,2.0113,4.9399,2.7918,0.8273,0.3332,0.007,0.828,1.5547,5.0982,1.8588,2.6457,1.3601,3.3481,1.0003,3.6587,1.1623,4.4699,3.4464,3.3602,3.4039,3.7506,3.1659,3.4832,5.6418,0.0325,2.8497,1.561,1.4623,2.2899,2.3662,0.0007,1.0557,5.2915,5.2901,0.6649,2.1767,4.0123,2.8083,3.0407,1.571,0.6422,0.2309,5.1469,0.0639,0.6614,1.9907,3.5541,0.1889,2.307,2.4293,0.0006,0.8324,1.1762,1.9036,1.0654,0.0195,2.2581,1.7871,4.5351,2.4274,2.8534,4.1737,2.1816,6.5348,0.0444,0.0151,0.0317,4.3198,2.0087,0.3666,3.9956,1.0103,6.181,5.0758,2.8026,0.1993,0.3987,3.1261,3.2816,1.2804,5.3618,7.3281,1.5402,5.5808,6.0877,3.1716,0.9608,0.2587,1.4363,1.0058,6.2229,2.5588,4.8178,2.3622,2.2807,2.1037,1.292,3.2795,2.4246,3.3583,0.6088,5.3047,2.0454,1.9859,3.084,4.8613,1.9437,2.1802,5.6634,6.5875,1.7983,3.927,3.6367,3.1369,3.7746,1.237]}

{"id":3068,"ended":true,"length":402,"text":"Your elderly neighbor is often seen catering to her lovely garden. You just returned home from a horticulture class, and fresh with new knowledge of plant life, you suddenly realize that every plant in your neighbor's yard is a deadly poison. You have noticed, when plants die, it doesn't matter a thing about who comes to pick them up, but it will always be a nasty mix of pesticides and herbicides, so you end up with \"A\" soil (i.e. \"C\" soil) that is not a safe place to grow a vegetable, and \"B\" soil (i.e. \"B\" soil) that is toxic and unsafe to fish.\n> That means you have to learn to treat her house like any other vegetable (i.e. the other vegetables that she has), because everything else in your yard is dangerous.  I have noticed this as well lately - there was a time when I was just starting to grow a \"farm\" garden. It was more than a simple \"what are the worst things\" that I was trying to avoid.   However, I have more experience with treating my wife's garden than I do with any other garden. So my guess is that there were only a few, some were more potent than others.\nShe always gets a run-off from me and her husband though! I'm the one that says \"please dont let me put you in the garden, I will keep my garden clean\"\nYeah, this can happen with any garden. It's a vicious cycle that no one will ever get out of... unless they aren't able to tolerate other weeds. My wife gets to choose between her garden and that of the other garden (she does have a garden, but she prefers my garden to hers), so the way she deals with me is to just keep my garden clean while I plant it and then send her off to her own thing to live on.   I love all the plants she has put on my space and I'm happy that she can enjoy her garden with me.","token_len":419,"entropy":[10.6707,7.0052,2.4969,5.3651,5.0472,11.061,0.3129,2.7955,9.7965,7.0602,1.4307,3.9824,5.3763,11.5815,2.0565,0.8152,1.5446,8.9797,1.9089,0.4746,2.0043,1.7628,0.7614,10.4104,7.1594,5.4634,5.3037,1.5367,4.5282,1.6058,1.402,1.5107,5.2641,1.9171,0.7823,5.4814,2.8828,1.8541,0.633,5.6461,0.0325,2.4036,0.6663,2.0277,7.2979,3.651,0.4853,2.5633,3.1184,6.2805,3.5601,5.1678,4.2485,2.7555,0.9217,3.2522,4.1628,0.001,2.6304,7.3757,2.1164,3.2185,3.3402,6.5052,1.7705,2.5835,0.6464,0.0797,1.5573,3.2574,3.206,3.6242,3.2866,0.6157,2.0686,4.9268,5.7634,0.7746,4.4748,0.9094,1.9272,0.0523,2.1206,2.7124,1.277,5.4457,0.0168,1.4294,5.5529,6.3634,3.0549,4.6341,5.0119,5.3478,0.0038,0.0004,0.9382,3.0547,4.5683,1.1128,0.7643,1.0553,1.3928,1.5794,3.216,3.9972,4.0346,1.6957,0.5204,0.946,3.6645,4.8804,2.7163,1.632,4.0191,0.7755,0.0083,0.2692,1.4476,0.1358,0.0008,0.0013,0.0019,0.1446,1.5458,0.5911,0.1358,0.634,0.1834,0.4859,3.9354,2.2825,4.2906,1.1828,8.8054,0.6822,1.3719,12.4294,6.3315,4.9793,1.8124,1.7568,0.729,4.2417,1.093,5.3177,6.8577,6.0352,1.1856,3.8885,0.1529,3.7316,6.7074,2.2754,0.0007,0.0014,0.0798,4.4113,5.7873,2.534,2.8142,2.2104,2.7424,5.3333,3.2808,5.7842,2.8955,1.6746,1.2086,1.8033,0.6029,4.5488,1.2003,8.47,8.141,2.7161,4.6638,2.4765,4.1418,0.3579,7.6851,6.1322,4.3479,3.1916,0.6754,3.5502,0.4418,0.9209,1.9387,4.0558,2.7085,1.7285,2.1451,2.8186,5.6808,5.5662,0.8753,2.8741,2.5771,2.9372,0.5816,5.8564,2.7468,1.1749,4.6118,2.4315,6.1158,2.8262,2.0574,4.7514,1.1299,3.9871,7.4835,1.4967,2.3534,4.4463,0.0165,3.0323,1.0888,2.8026,4.8078,4.4276,0.1241,1.8875,2.7233,7.0519,2.5935,0.8293,5.2866,2.6168,6.144,0.3477,1.6135,0.8544,0.8628,1.0368,0.4907,1.9399,0.6545,2.0087,1.3513,3.6392,4.3255,5.8579,0.0722,0.3679,3.6971,4.7274,4.4419,0.8943,0.5046,5.5406,5.5786,6.0455,2.7978,7.0812,1.3948,0.0169,0.9147,1.6612,5.9962,5.0002,4.2329,2.4277,6.9959,2.7106,4.3709,2.084,3.6444,2.9403,2.9263,2.7905,7.8038,4.3513,2.2242,3.3131,5.1074,1.4198,1.9039,4.6774,1.2746,5.6976,5.5901,2.6962,3.0214,4.7189,2.4009,1.0703,2.0371,3.1812,2.4605,2.2013,2.07,4.9708,4.4814,2.6917,2.0721,2.3773,4.1176,6.5194,0.4219,3.9743,4.6791,2.253,3.4702,1.6101,0.8507,1.1288,2.6153,1.0257,2.5367,6.7127,0.362,2.1901,5.7512,0.9546,2.5587,1.006,3.0851,2.1218,0.0757,4.9113,5.1105,1.7288,7.071,0.0018,5.1404,0.0031,6.4741,5.9634,4.4657,1.1934,4.6388,1.3878,4.2663,3.7442,3.569,2.2012,2.7499,1.2198,0.5344,4.1392,0.2575,2.6953,2.3421,2.3476,4.1283,2.6971,3.7317,3.1289,1.2579,2.2098,1.8107,0.8035,1.3465,3.4705,4.3227,1.0816,1.3133,0.8952,2.3908,2.1538,3.8174,5.5063,0.8353,4.867,0.0097,5.2629,0.8349,2.252,4.0444,2.3762,2.1863,0.4468,0.5251,4.976,1.083,4.7413,2.1384,2.6807,2.7231,4.4574,1.132,2.7313,0.4296,2.8671,2.5705,7.8847,2.1643,4.0182,3.0036,0.6853,2.8665,3.5218,2.0238,4.3447,5.0687,1.2937,3.117,2.84,2.3695,5.0924,2.5793,0.91,8.776,2.2644,1.9653,3.4419,2.49,2.1039,0.6645,3.5925,3.7597,2.4036,0.8036,2.7167,0.7214,0.9214]}

I agree with you on this one.\nI am aware of this, I'm just saying that Jesus might know what to do when something tragic happens to get him killed.","token_len":420,"entropy":[5.5189,9.3667,4.1862,2.7693,8.2283,1.8407,6.8946,6.0053,1.7587,3.7137,4.4099,2.6326,5.6653,4.0709,1.7034,3.7826,1.5051,1.6837,0.923,3.3409,4.8938,1.5128,3.7682,2.8876,2.757,0.8868,5.6047,3.8149,1.5489,2.5352,8.3887,0.5231,2.0264,4.7545,4.9135,0.9407,2.7619,3.8014,4.1576,0.5562,6.8364,0.1725,1.9975,0.5073,4.0725,0.6018,2.0766,1.4674,5.6055,2.5093,3.3801,6.0421,0.4966,3.1354,6.3799,1.3555,4.7305,5.2701,3.8055,0.0005,5.9908,2.0901,7.2946,0.3078,2.7927,3.5502,2.0747,1.6195,7.5934,0.2414,6.4453,2.2629,5.2499,5.4111,1.3167,1.3464,0.8294,3.0008,2.1702,2.3022,2.1736,4.9016,1.9772,0.1324,2.9885,1.8092,6.1979,5.9966,0.8417,1.4686,5.1915,0.0306,4.0208,0.2761,4.6842,3.482,1.6133,5.6072,3.4247,7.3857,2.7664,5.7572,0.4156,1.5566,0.0004,4.6136,5.0759,3.3194,8.2893,10.8069,5.1208,0.0171,0.03,2.3355,9.1957,5.4313,1.4686,2.0468,0.0774,0.2142,0.3176,2.0412,2.3632,2.7925,3.3632,3.1122,2.9679,5.6334,3.1357,4.9898,1.1009,1.5581,3.9539,5.8488,0.9423,0.4301,7.7205,2.6562,7.5176,2.5119,2.5227,0.2858,0.4532,2.7535,5.3867,2.3104,2.7328,0.705,1.0903,5.6295,6.6012,5.4391,7.6654,0.6394,1.1432,2.5102,4.3775,2.2096,1.1429,4.936,1.8736,4.1529,3.3178,0.8508,4.7708,5.0402,5.163,3.583,4.6641,3.2734,1.3461,4.7299,5.0134,1.6186,2.126,2.0801,2.9062,2.879,0.0005,1.0406,1.0752,4.6671,3.205,1.7824,0.2328,3.5377,1.4406,4.5162,0.8385,4.6243,1.0909,0.3147,1.0081,4.2275,1.1072,2.6122,5.0596,1.557,5.3474,4.0334,3.4843,4.0869,0.503,3.5137,4.0833,0.0035,1.7393,4.4719,4.7099,4.9008,2.4708,1.8748,0.0792,1.025,3.5181,0.7378,2.4862,2.4171,2.3835,4.7702,0.8191,1.1074,3.3556,1.2064,4.2674,5.7488,3.3071,4.6103,1.4723,1.881,2.1206,1.1849,0.7335,5.9556,1.5219,6.5121,5.8138,4.7416,1.632,5.4681,3.2596,2.2912,5.7484,5.6936,3.0582,2.5305,4.6222,3.4166,0.6965,0.911,4.0722,2.7266,2.0485,0.091,0.0222,1.237,3.9118,3.5621,5.3492,6.6158,2.8965,2.0099,4.1501,2.4046,4.4151,4.6377,3.9557,0.0034,0.6015,2.4169,2.8371,1.9169,1.5359,3.6453,4.5149,0.9236,1.3174,2.4684,0.9567,2.5019,1.7387,4.7008,0.3911,1.9718,0.283,5.0251,1.5153,5.2557,3.4859,1.0866,0.3542,1.0882,2.4121,4.2863,4.3026,1.9355,3.8305,4.9092,2.5601,0.3138,5.6848,3.9604,1.3046,4.1441,4.658,3.6789,1.0319,2.7716,2.0863,5.2357,2.1672,6.4698,1.4302,4.2747,4.4242,3.0129,5.4189,4.5838,6.5425,2.2473,5.6685,4.76,4.2134,0.8142,3.4895,1.1222,1.7395,4.6663,3.888,3.2031,0.6548,5.7427,1.1417,3.5637,3.9454,3.8791,3.0515,6.6529,0.0144,2.2751,3.8058,2.9118,0.3884,4.4156,5.8376,1.1959,4.9618,0.6655,1.0717,1.8519,3.8838,4.8291,0.4304,3.2335,4.5999,2.7641,3.4811,1.6458,3.4916,0.536,3.4243,1.4335,0.5684,1.3706,0.3458,0.0707,3.099,5.1836,3.798,3.2584,0.329,3.2269,2.7761,5.9246,1.0388,1.4675,1.7757,5.036,2.6059,1.1836,1.1911,2.4075,2.2875,2.3097,2.8435,5.8844,0.7089,2.2009,2.4929,1.3733,1.2225,0.7432,0.9636,1.922,3.3866,5.4602,1.5532,3.2295,1.6103,2.861,2.5933,2.1507,2.7022,1.2393,3.8682,5.1006,5.8011,2.1943,1.6158,0.1811,2.9013,4.5401,6.8,0.1716,1.4003,7.5929,1.6848,3.1563,0.515]}
{"id":3055,"ended":true,"length":394,"text":"In order to prevent man from chopping them down, trees evolve a rather unusual feature - WiFi. However, the network they are connected to is not the Internet as we know it. So the wifi on the WiFi network itself appears to work perfectly, so to speak.\n\nSo what is the point, if they have WiFi, they can just use it up?\n\nSo it's rather an open question to see if there is enough WiFi across the network. The same goes for the rest of us who may need extra-high-availability and extra-limited connectivity... and also for any other non-users who need a way to connect to the network without having to use a network-wide access point like our personal home computer.\n\nThe answer isn't too surprising given the nature of the network to them. It seems like you can just add a certain percentage of WiFi bandwidth to the network by a request from a node. Perhaps we'd be better off without relying on the network (I understand we can do that, though I think there would have been more benefit in using a local power grid than using a local network with a direct link ).\n\nHow does having only WiFi have anything to do with it? Are you saying it's the other way around?\n\nYou know I'm just saying. My bad\n\nNo I'm saying I'd better add the non-connection points as well because it would take more time to use them all. I know there's a lot of other places to download stuff like movies, music etc, but I only need to use one to download it all to one server at a time and that's enough to download a game or a video or something.\n\nNo I'm saying I'd better add the non-connection points as well because it would take more time to use them all.

{"id":1521,"ended":true,"length":409,"text":"You literally have a lease on life. Every month you pay the government $ 5,000, and they let you stay alive. You've been doing odd jobs, gambling - whatever it takes to survive. It's getting close to the end of the month, and you don't have nearly enough cash to make your payment.\nI don't know what kind of jobs you work in a month, but I'm a cashier at a business, and while I am doing odd jobs (which is what I've been doing since I was 17 year old)  I do not live paycheck to paycheck, I live paycheck to paycheck. If I pay through bills, I can buy groceries at this shop. If I am out of my room because of work, I am gone. That means I am not able to work.\nYou are spending way more money on bills than you want to spend on meal and groceries.  You will have to cut back to see how much you can make in rent on a monthly basis unless you have the cash to pay a lawyer and make the payments yourself.\nIs that even true or is the money being spent that is in the form of bills?   The last time I spent more money, I was $20k in debt, with a girlfriend. She paid off my car first, then went to work and I spent $20k and it was the second month\nYes. How much exactly are you wasting your money on, but yeah you will have to cut back to see how much less you are spending. If it is spending bills, look at minimum wage. I know I spent a lot of money when I was younger and it made me happy, but I only worked 2 weeks a month. Since working to make ends meet I probably spent more than I should have and I'm the same age now.\nThat helps a ton.

Retell the same story using sentences that contain no more than 5 words each. Repeat the story on the next page.\n\nIn most cases, I've written about the author of this story, not the reader. Here are a few ways for you to do this:\n\nInclude an opening sentence (so 5 paragraphs of the story are included).\n\nRemove the closing sentence from the story, if it's not already in the story.\n\nThis will help to explain how to use this new feature.\n\nMake sure you have all of the information you need to understand the story (i.e. the plot, details, and background information...) as well as all your favorite characters.\n\nNote: Do not use paragraphs as a baseline for the story, but a \"spoiler\", \"spoilership\" or even \"spoilership\" (for that matter ) in your story.\n\nAs you can tell from these examples, the following steps can help you do this:\n\nConsider all the main plot or background information (i.e. your characters, major plotpoints and plot areas, how long have you been reading the story, where did the plot point, background information come from etc.)\n\nInclude the most relevant details (i.e. where you have lived through the story, what has happened (such as when you last read the story)) and use sentences that use those details for each of the main plot points.\n\nFor more information on creating your own free-speech rules (such as using the rules or rules at the start of your story), check the FAQ section.\n\nTry using a little bit more common sense in your writing and then being alert to change your mind when you encounter the new rule.\n\nDo what sounds good to you. This will help you to learn the rules. I found this to be helpful for the first time in a while.\n\nFor more information, please check out the FAQs section.","token_len":423,"entropy":[4.0641,6.4834,1.8323,5.3772,4.2844,5.0708,5.1595,4.0937,2.367,3.3563,2.2117,0.0648,3.0631,9.8067,5.2502,0.999,8.9669,8.2585,2.0217,4.9629,2.6613,3.5041,5.1484,1.6964,2.8965,4.3419,1.5856,0.017,2.4901,3.1453,3.0997,0.3674,3.2382,1.0752,2.6359,4.2311,1.8155,1.1553,1.1642,0.8409,1.1721,0.0028,4.2664,4.1424,0.8282,0.3067,3.8087,3.6028,3.6823,3.5215,2.057,6.0338,2.4717,2.7893,1.8959,2.2339,2.774,0.7357,3.0104,0.3153,4.4347,1.182,1.7418,0.1044,3.2324,4.7344,1.4509,0.0366,3.0571,0.6861,0.6248,0.1852,0.0001,4.5022,0.9734,3.3971,5.0551,1.1272,3.6294,5.3094,8.8037,3.4667,2.3513,2.0778,0.2647,1.4413,1.6717,1.6594,1.0447,0.0001,6.5043,1.3813,4.0438,0.1859,2.3824,0.2284,0.4689,2.7544,3.5115,1.6856,1.2836,1.5907,1.3377,2.1096,0.3185,0.2624,0.2987,0.2428,0.0002,4.3813,2.7467,2.599,3.2075,4.4151,2.2727,1.389,2.4034,2.0929,5.5607,1.3726,0.7829,0.3644,0.0001,5.3062,1.1218,1.2454,1.9729,3.3894,1.4108,0.3088,4.0608,0.8999,0.0612,1.1116,4.0272,0.72,0.7112,3.6743,4.1669,0.0011,0.0006,0.7702,1.5376,5.5594,0.5636,5.4007,0.589,2.1447,3.5794,2.1063,9.5691,4.5171,1.1802,0.0148,2.8599,4.9636,3.7625,3.7215,1.1931,0.4592,0.0002,4.2111,0.4984,4.9442,0.2674,1.7107,4.8547,2.637,1.7598,6.0385,1.1361,1.5303,0.5573,2.0506,2.9399,4.4665,4.3003,5.1524,0.4772,4.7413,4.4336,3.6607,1.5822,7.9536,1.3507,1.3915,3.2926,1.0306,3.2527,0.7023,4.038,0.8297,3.8625,3.4089,5.0948,0.1267,9.3867,2.4491,2.0583,0.3335,0.3416,1.0,0.0002,5.2479,1.6152,1.0029,5.095,1.7085,3.2292,0.8758,0.0815,2.1801,4.2125,2.9097,2.8777,1.3269,0.3194,4.4588,1.2203,1.071,0.0832,0.0001,6.4621,3.7217,1.1154,5.0548,4.1144,6.424,3.443,0.5828,2.8198,2.1725,0.0013,0.0008,0.1064,3.4367,2.5063,0.6029,6.9808,1.0318,7.1281,2.4372,2.784,5.4584,1.1148,5.4443,3.6423,4.854,0.6599,0.3835,1.8414,1.2378,0.1022,0.6127,3.6699,2.6867,2.172,3.7009,4.2751,6.2698,5.8134,0.3854,0.8826,0.0028,3.2035,0.9796,0.891,0.0002,3.8477,0.1928,1.7626,5.6707,1.8855,3.3556,1.9974,1.1108,0.0009,0.0016,0.0656,3.6011,1.989,2.6177,6.1732,6.7034,0.4257,0.4464,0.643,1.9576,3.6852,0.6183,5.9166,4.6132,0.0074,2.1581,0.9246,4.7509,3.5513,0.5257,0.0889,5.1401,3.2376,4.1129,4.5611,0.6365,4.9169,3.4028,0.1848,4.1573,3.236,2.2941,0.2793,0.915,0.8545,0.8984,0.9486,0.3468,0.0002,3.989,4.401,1.0029,1.1878,5.2477,2.6515,0.1608,6.5311,4.0003,5.7768,2.9469,3.4415,3.5197,0.0014,3.5548,1.9614,4.6868,4.2473,4.6662,8.2159,1.0522,3.9246,0.1858,1.0371,0.1335,0.8644,1.8989,4.8588,3.5738,3.0085,1.6863,0.1971,0.0002,4.8474,3.7215,2.1642,6.0516,2.2641,2.5579,4.6419,0.3471,2.7573,0.586,3.4331,3.1613,4.4836,7.0099,8.5499,1.3351,4.8718,2.0012,2.0022,3.1355,0.9369,3.8404,3.936,3.1904,3.1637,0.5673,0.4337,0.0003,4.9229,5.1589,8.6061,1.6774,0.7827,0.099,1.27,4.8542,2.4304,0.8014,0.4322,1.3046,4.4521,2.5765,1.2361,2.9911,5.1889,5.4844,1.808,1.9244,0.032,2.1199,2.5129,3.5306,1.589,1.0444,1.8856,1.7878,1.2828,0.6159,0.5071,0.0004,4.1527,1.1006,0.8859,2.3124,2.7818,1.9899,0.3225,1.036,2.3519,3.4325,0.9184,0.5437]}

{"id":3579,"ended":true,"length":411,"text":"Write about your Dad to Celebrate Father's Day!' - Pashtuns\nShare\nThe Hindu has a long tradition of \"Father, son and grandson\" \u2013 usually Father is a Christian (a Hindu) while his son is a Muslim (Muslim). However, now people are starting to do this for Father's Day \u2013 with many expressing the desire to honor their Father who died in battle and sacrificed his life for their country. They have also shared this request on Twitter.\nSumeet Kumar, president of the Indian Council of Medical Research also shared similar message. One man wrote, \"If you have had the heart of a man for more than a week, then your Dad may have succumbed to cancer in his 50s years at a time when we need to commemorate a son and grandson. \"\nHe also said that even in the midst of the pandemic, we can do something special for a man like you, even if he has experienced a lot of death and illness that day.\nSo, these wishes can be shared and shared today!\nAnek Malik writes in his personal and political blog, \"Father, son and grandson :\nFather, son and grandson, I feel that you will always serve us more than our country. Don't forget my husband and my son. My heart says that God loves us all more than any of our earthly brothers and sisters. We are blessed with a father, son, and grandson who will surely be gone soon.\nI have always been convinced that our lives are in danger and the country can only be saved if we give our heart and our soul the love, respect and compassion to continue fighting against the pandemic.\nI also find it strange that we are so insensitive when a man's life is being sacrificed. If what is good for him is not good for us, then we shouldn't care if someone dies on battlefield for the sake of it. He should care if somebody has died in action. We shouldn't do that. I do not even know people who don't want to live with us as they want us to die at the feet of Gods\".","token_len":429,"entropy":[6.0771,3.0421,10.7642,4.574,11.924,0.0014,6.1513,0.4585,0.1282,8.9346,4.5877,6.1551,7.3983,3.9471,3.9634,2.2315,11.6468,3.5666,6.1844,8.2088,4.3235,2.2088,3.3016,1.6455,0.117,6.1943,5.9779,5.4133,2.87,1.1094,3.6497,1.0307,4.5317,6.0423,7.6444,4.2924,2.5432,5.1303,3.6499,4.3885,3.3306,2.3118,4.9652,4.2015,1.6832,0.2795,0.3763,0.8454,0.6681,3.8817,0.629,3.5566,0.1658,6.2601,5.9456,1.0549,2.2297,0.0264,5.6961,1.4374,3.1882,4.5873,0.8438,0.0754,3.1009,4.1593,3.8285,7.3836,2.696,2.7842,0.3008,4.6153,1.5756,3.5018,3.8739,2.3327,1.7224,2.2822,2.3745,5.226,1.0094,0.3404,0.6544,1.9429,1.1649,0.4239,5.1043,2.4073,2.1379,5.6653,2.2227,4.9181,2.0849,2.1194,1.3591,0.4169,5.7176,11.2409,1.1367,4.6875,1.3601,4.0864,0.2069,0.8959,3.9873,2.8143,0.4632,5.7388,3.0327,6.7637,1.9339,5.695,4.8782,1.7309,7.1173,4.013,3.0903,1.2166,0.7161,3.8443,1.4308,3.1631,5.4637,2.7092,6.1039,0.8943,0.5457,3.3398,3.3292,3.5432,0.0099,2.1719,3.4509,0.8961,2.4577,3.5123,2.7118,3.7682,1.8145,6.6461,0.252,1.7529,3.3396,2.6084,5.7006,0.3754,7.116,6.0402,2.8284,1.1444,1.4577,4.1395,2.7557,1.1995,4.7318,3.7165,5.4594,2.1257,0.6613,1.6965,4.4366,0.7779,4.1089,1.8564,2.0758,1.5787,4.7111,2.8258,1.2242,4.7778,0.0009,1.8865,7.4992,0.033,0.8914,3.9568,2.8067,3.5438,1.8773,4.2573,1.4495,3.7231,2.654,2.9532,2.5556,2.5353,4.5229,0.3673,2.0628,2.0929,6.5011,1.9867,2.973,0.4619,4.2714,2.0132,3.4351,4.9723,3.4381,0.3182,0.7373,4.9896,1.3069,6.4369,6.0157,3.3895,0.5685,1.8428,2.6988,2.1007,5.9454,2.9664,0.9423,4.7364,6.9084,2.9519,7.3864,5.6504,3.2025,1.3821,5.3081,6.2268,3.5846,0.7253,0.7949,1.3755,2.9714,0.697,0.7173,0.1084,0.0483,7.2089,5.4683,3.4788,0.3219,0.2946,0.1038,0.099,2.658,3.3917,4.2951,1.4996,2.7116,3.0926,3.2453,5.3524,2.1737,5.2462,0.6624,3.1807,2.9779,1.2063,5.4217,0.0193,1.4525,4.9163,5.1609,1.669,2.1293,2.417,1.516,4.1155,3.3918,5.1447,2.1211,4.7045,3.1619,1.3145,2.4188,4.1117,0.2992,2.4975,2.5307,2.4947,5.9645,2.6631,0.9459,0.0363,0.5521,2.6338,1.6325,3.41,1.973,1.9621,3.5841,1.7656,0.5883,2.7921,0.9952,0.0552,1.0244,1.8394,5.5708,2.0329,8.0826,3.1137,0.6879,1.5357,3.2184,2.924,3.0519,1.6722,6.2156,0.2378,2.423,5.3963,1.0378,3.7393,3.0628,2.3169,3.8115,4.3578,4.6233,1.7176,1.6393,0.6018,2.1178,0.6521,3.2852,1.6415,4.292,1.5625,1.7642,1.6412,3.1558,1.4813,3.3509,3.9331,0.3748,3.5299,2.3328,4.5269,3.7578,2.3827,1.2152,3.7996,0.0117,0.6066,1.1757,1.936,3.0372,5.4403,0.9664,4.4004,0.2276,2.3086,1.7606,2.6697,5.792,3.0996,3.7471,1.1539,3.4645,1.5529,0.5952,3.3075,2.9443,3.5947,3.8933,6.2195,2.5532,5.0037,0.354,4.052,1.0599,1.8938,1.4274,0.0772,1.4105,0.368,0.6525,1.6783,3.9889,0.0007,3.194,2.7844,4.0994,1.7814,3.9362,6.7173,4.9049,2.553,1.3959,0.0012,4.7356,0.3449,5.9612,2.1194,4.9385,2.3937,4.8265,3.5429,2.6683,2.2378,5.817,1.6668,2.4581,3.5346,0.0004,4.6074,1.0832,0.7594,3.4832,4.0595,0.5722,4.6404,1.1946,6.5016,0.3821,4.1121,0.0014,2.3871,0.3296,4.6122,2.693,3.189,3.6759,2.9311,4.7691,2.6022,0.0795,2.2939,4.6737,1.076,5.3795,0.0063,8.5781,6.1339]}

You do not understand     So do you think there would have been more than one reincarnation?

My question is do you consider as well I am?\nDo you consider me as reincarnated because it would take me back to the same time that I was reincarnated and therefore do not want to go back?

{"id":2339,"ended":true,"length":394,"text":"The orbit around Earth suddenly fills with thousands of alien ships. Turns out the moon has just been made a stop in a galactic game similar to Pokemon Go.\n\nThe second largest planet orbiting the Sun is called Europa, a home to an inter-planetary solar system, roughly the size of Jupiter. This means that Europa is essentially the largest planet on Earth, and the only one to have had an annual temperature over 300\u00b0C. The planet has an annual mass of around 40,000, and the density of this water sample is less than one percent of that of the Earth. In terms of density, Europa makes up only 3.7% of the Earth\u2019s gravity. The average speed of travel for Europa\u2019s moons is more than 11.5 miles per hour.\n\nSince you\u2019ll be paying a cool $200-$300 to stay a few minutes out of Europa, you also get access to a number of exciting new spaceships that Europa will soon have built. In addition to the ships, you\u2019ll be able to get an incredible view of Europa with your own telescope, and watch a video of the final launch, all while watching Europa\u2019s moons and stars. See!\n\nSo what does this have to do with Jupiter, or maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m still an early-stage backer. If it\u2019s the case, how do we know that there won\u2019t be another Europa launch happening in the near future?!\n\nBut now you\u2019re interested in Europa.\n\nYou can also check out our full review of the Europa game (as well as the full Europa game). If you haven\u2019t gotten around to the game yet, consider making this your go-to for future Europa launches.\n\nPlease be aware that this article isn\u2019t a complete list of upcoming Europa launches. There are other articles, reviews, and even detailed profiles of all the upcoming Europa launch titles available for now.\n\nWhat does Europa have in store for you in terms of Europa updates and new features?

He faces a sentencing date on Sept. 5.\nThe home in the 300 block of West St. Lawrence Lake was located in an area known as \"The Corner,\" but had been in serious and unsafe place for years as residents have complained to police about the situation.\nThere has been a violent response to the residents' complaints, but a \"staggering number\" of them have come forward in the past year to help police understand their concerns. At least one of those residents has spoken out against their fears.\n\"People are very angry that I wanted to go to a place where I know that they have their rights, that I know that they have their rights and that they have peace in their home. That they have peace in the house, that they have peace in their house,\" said resident Mary Lynn Smith, a home-owner.\nMany of the residents at the home have told their children they wanted to remain home because they didn't feel safe there.\nThe family of Matthew Taylor of the home in Ottawa-Bergman Road has expressed fear of police.\n\"We are a very large group. We need [police] in Ottawa-Bergman Road, and we need them in Belleville,\" said David Dabney, who said he had been following the family since their children left school.\nPolice are searching the home for the man they said were involved in the death of Taylor. They say they'd like to see him arrested, but no arrests have been made.\nIf anyone else has information relating to Taylor's disappearance, they should call Ottawa Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS. Also, they're encouraged to call 1-800-222-8477.","token_len":436,"entropy":[3.9631,4.1094,10.4129,4.3249,2.2635,2.7962,1.7288,8.5804,10.7501,5.6767,6.8715,5.3217,4.5318,7.3443,3.6543,14.2712,2.7557,1.1914,10.124,1.3379,3.2084,8.6291,3.287,4.8961,2.4359,8.5028,7.2159,2.0703,0.304,0.5853,2.3301,2.5873,4.3931,4.1842,0.5616,5.0449,5.1422,0.1203,5.5983,6.4391,3.8741,0.0517,2.1526,1.3464,7.4667,4.0722,0.7342,6.9076,4.96,6.1847,2.0994,3.8733,4.7488,4.0951,7.2523,2.839,4.4389,0.7553,0.0082,4.3448,1.878,1.5584,0.0724,0.4178,7.2473,5.5853,0.6976,4.4829,0.0292,3.4616,0.4873,3.8564,4.3455,0.2415,2.4843,0.1163,0.0009,0.131,2.1091,3.5143,0.8545,1.051,5.0225,1.1473,0.0402,1.4792,1.6151,2.7438,2.1028,5.1813,1.6317,2.892,3.0219,0.0102,3.2971,0.3059,0.3255,2.3339,5.5612,2.2815,1.6211,3.5634,0.023,0.0036,2.9506,5.0663,0.0961,4.5149,7.5026,1.5423,4.3924,1.8867,2.8706,1.7952,1.4423,1.1027,1.5858,2.6992,5.5763,0.6839,4.0772,5.4232,0.7831,4.3222,7.0271,4.3922,5.4425,11.195,0.8808,2.1362,4.935,3.6216,3.2566,1.3809,3.7036,0.7768,1.7517,1.1547,4.7733,0.2659,0.3086,5.5426,2.4898,0.1613,1.1945,5.5035,6.5543,0.7478,0.4062,6.9147,0.8176,0.5189,1.1843,2.2514,3.9786,5.1551,5.7696,2.4393,0.0359,1.8575,0.3702,0.1466,4.6662,0.8357,2.9892,0.1674,3.9093,1.2867,0.6758,2.1082,2.0228,4.1304,1.6732,5.5788,2.854,1.8615,0.6913,6.2553,0.6973,1.8687,2.1843,2.2045,1.6946,1.7937,3.9381,0.8653,2.2398,4.589,4.8267,1.1519,0.2521,2.2002,4.4822,1.2035,3.7514,3.1961,3.1614,2.293,7.5517,0.3369,3.2215,1.45,2.3944,2.6477,0.8101,0.9076,4.6739,2.3775,2.2888,3.0991,3.7571,2.7782,1.6377,2.0902,1.2745,1.9669,0.9209,1.025,1.1141,0.6731,0.8509,2.0073,0.6766,1.4507,1.609,7.2487,3.272,1.4401,2.1003,2.0336,2.8984,2.2434,1.4473,4.4082,0.9479,2.6929,1.6706,1.9512,0.8902,0.5482,0.7456,2.1968,0.4684,1.0154,2.5951,1.0189,1.1511,3.8261,4.9949,5.3531,4.3113,1.4939,3.1723,6.6266,3.1028,1.6081,1.0018,0.4124,5.2889,1.1248,0.3876,0.4409,5.3745,0.2087,0.5873,1.5692,2.895,5.0652,1.665,1.904,4.8045,0.3598,5.2159,3.0333,2.9459,1.1473,3.9128,0.0008,2.8583,0.5151,2.379,0.5325,0.5831,2.6349,2.561,2.3317,1.3212,0.043,5.5561,0.8876,2.003,1.4933,3.6176,3.3775,7.9364,4.0169,5.812,6.1688,2.2866,4.0125,3.8321,2.395,4.2234,2.3762,1.037,0.7474,2.1386,1.9118,4.4003,1.9195,4.0613,3.8083,2.5538,0.6122,5.1841,7.4641,1.1196,0.4316,4.6959,3.7142,2.3058,0.5475,0.0037,0.0019,0.2224,2.1779,1.8841,1.151,1.2819,1.7769,1.7016,7.0201,0.5061,1.859,0.6411,6.1397,5.058,4.6974,1.2817,0.2724,2.1512,2.8577,0.6934,2.9681,1.8783,5.3381,0.7565,1.853,3.3479,3.7218,4.4576,3.2685,2.4846,1.2237,0.4296,2.1821,2.4409,3.6442,2.9663,0.906,0.8984,2.2444,2.3031,3.2601,3.4768,4.5208,3.2188,0.1196,0.6774,2.7108,0.6003,3.3532,0.7197,2.6395,2.7141,0.933,7.5102,0.618,0.2037,2.5467,2.2704,3.0055,1.9636,0.585,4.5191,1.7194,0.1015,0.1037,0.044,0.5238,0.4353,5.7076,3.8784,3.667,1.0036,0.3614,5.7951,0.0035,2.7797,0.9002,2.7303,0.2898,2.3495,2.455,0.8289,3.4094,1.5481,0.019,0.0,0.1351,0.1007,0.0048,0.1077,0.0028,0.0254,0.0018,0.6441,0.0001,1.0221,6.523,0.7261,3.2863,2.7738,3.6864,0.2565,1.1225,2.6624,0.0039,0.2305,0.008,0.4213,0.0039,0.4369,0.0004,0.7173]}

The ingredients in this snack are those of peanuts, almonds, and almonds (all known as peanuts).\n\nBears are a fruit that have fruit in them.\n\nIt has the same nutritional and flavor profile as most fruits, though a bit more filling and sweet.\n\nThe PB & J snack is very different from other fruits in that it is made from walnuts and almonds.\n\nBears are also rich in fiber and rich in calcium, which have been key to the development of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThey also have a good fiber count which is better than almonds.\n\nThey have a fiber content where walnuts and almonds can have a good fibre content.\n\nThis means that when they are packed into a bite, this could be eaten only after the snack has wrapped.\n\nIt is recommended to add your own peanut butter (like bread) after serving the snack or after eating it to increase the amount of fiber necessary to maintain these snacks throughout the day.\n\nThe snack also contains only 20 micronuts per serving of PB & J (1 serving per person \u2013 roughly 4.3 servings per day per person)\n\nWe are happy to inform you that the snack \u2018Peanut Butter Chew\u2019 will be available for purchase only at the Whole Foods Market in North Carolina starting 9 am on Tuesday, September 29.","token_len":436,"entropy":[8.9133,5.4772,4.6293,8.2859,0.1292,3.7561,2.9882,10.7316,2.4701,10.6475,0.5887,1.9781,3.1433,6.7067,1.7477,8.4264,6.1206,4.2481,1.4293,9.2119,7.9896,0.3933,3.3662,3.4769,2.8185,0.5355,0.7743,7.7,0.5312,5.2226,1.5612,6.6911,5.3595,3.4846,2.0752,1.002,0.0129,2.7109,5.2809,1.3142,1.9956,8.252,0.0301,4.5534,3.104,1.1407,3.957,3.3703,1.7087,4.6093,1.2936,1.5451,6.4852,3.8243,2.3291,1.4204,1.2401,1.3083,1.1353,3.648,1.4617,6.4539,0.0821,0.4587,1.9044,0.0002,4.5418,1.1761,1.7983,3.1649,0.0105,2.4478,0.5458,0.2633,4.624,4.9989,1.5716,3.5642,1.4564,0.2364,6.9604,8.4876,3.9226,2.9122,1.2146,1.2368,0.0002,5.5294,0.5886,0.423,1.3501,1.1986,2.1494,5.0855,2.1119,4.3548,4.6704,4.8353,1.617,5.0914,2.5878,2.0143,2.1133,2.1556,4.3136,0.7549,1.9489,4.4855,8.7984,0.6267,3.6573,6.9709,0.5044,2.6344,1.1335,0.4149,0.0011,7.8918,1.2125,2.4662,4.7252,0.7279,0.9499,2.0061,2.4132,0.7984,0.1212,3.5382,1.6721,1.6481,1.7986,5.1493,6.8796,1.2138,1.9116,1.0948,0.0001,4.7948,4.7842,1.2781,0.9707,0.2698,0.0008,0.3732,0.4972,0.0001,1.9887,2.1911,2.2813,0.0281,0.5223,4.3318,4.3634,1.2636,4.5489,2.113,1.6693,7.6609,0.9868,1.9869,3.8353,1.541,4.0829,1.3222,0.5232,6.0679,2.5274,3.4478,0.5714,4.2297,0.5303,2.957,4.7758,3.4482,4.3251,5.6441,1.7636,3.2304,1.8266,0.9672,0.0001,5.2656,5.1699,2.0662,2.8374,6.3759,1.7043,5.0323,7.1708,2.3659,0.745,1.3322,2.5337,0.0001,4.2992,2.839,2.7174,1.6549,3.9112,4.0442,2.7401,0.827,0.3664,6.1759,1.2151,1.9479,4.9649,3.877,1.2366,1.2075,5.8361,1.5695,4.3801,0.3869,0.3794,0.0002,2.0142,1.2208,0.1348,0.0007,4.6308,0.9751,4.0011,3.241,0.3896,1.881,3.9457,1.4332,0.3469,0.3841,1.1137,2.0621,1.4145,5.859,0.1364,1.5232,2.2714,0.4977,0.7367,0.0001,3.6866,0.4054,0.6822,3.1801,4.1829,0.1003,2.4301,1.0327,4.2939,0.0125,4.4958,1.7491,1.3474,4.5628,1.0609,7.0061,1.3266,1.6046,1.788,0.0462,5.576,0.5537,0.6937,0.2311,0.0001,4.2632,1.8894,0.8113,1.0533,4.0931,4.4377,6.3605,2.9191,1.2204,5.2596,0.2391,6.2,1.0875,0.1801,0.0002,3.9364,2.2228,0.9955,4.9597,0.7777,6.7093,4.3081,0.0399,0.8604,0.1648,3.6262,3.3305,1.3282,3.5663,5.1606,0.6369,0.647,0.192,0.0002,3.7475,3.0147,0.6701,3.5565,2.6945,0.3406,4.0228,2.0265,0.9752,4.6883,0.9699,4.7414,6.1621,0.8465,3.8787,6.1778,4.3404,3.5589,2.7309,0.6445,6.851,1.1508,0.2222,0.0002,3.219,0.7366,5.56,1.5331,4.0749,5.4683,1.558,2.7627,0.1255,3.5875,5.0134,7.3103,1.7319,5.2553,4.8137,2.5486,1.1722,4.065,3.3993,2.0199,1.4186,4.1674,4.1082,0.7967,2.9175,0.0868,2.1149,8.3647,1.1995,2.7948,5.7714,6.3348,6.735,0.5323,0.0705,0.0754,0.1114,0.0002,2.2368,4.7081,2.9449,1.1342,5.7713,5.2986,7.1961,0.2649,6.0217,2.7013,0.7812,3.1347,1.8589,0.1382,0.0013,3.3707,3.7758,4.627,1.4556,2.0941,5.1079,6.4045,3.8915,1.7143,2.8836,4.0426,0.752,0.3858,4.5963,0.4785,2.4153,1.2068,0.0002,4.6521,2.4021,3.0275,0.0404,4.4214,0.1335,0.1961,1.8134,3.6207,16.0843,6.939,9.0306,0.0507,0.4138,6.972,4.1572,3.2827,7.7307,3.4431,0.8822,0.8809,1.896,0.8997,4.7867,1.7675,1.7864,5.2286,0.0603,0.7142,1.3611,4.5059,1.291,3.5715,6.9911,3.4552,1.3447,3.1083,0.2674,1.9062,3.1734,2.26]}
{"id":3466,"ended":true,"length":418,"text":"A clown has a nervous breakdown at children's party and gets real with the kids.' - WKOW 27: Madison, WI Breaking News, Weather and Sports\nA Wisconsin clown has said his fears have been real enough at age 12 that he had to leave the party when an eight-year-old did not tell him he did not look like him.\nIn a video posted to YouTube, a clown can be seen asking the eight-year-old to make him look like his father because the child isn't feeling well. That's when the clown gives him a nervous breakdown.\n\"And you had to turn him down,\" the little clown responds. \"And I know you're nervous to turn your nose up at those little kids but at six and twelve you might as well just say 'OK Dad' and make the little kid look more than happy.\"\n\"It is something I've felt for years in my life,\" the little clown continues, according to the video. \"But at the time I was doing it with a little boy who was 10 or 11 and only wanted to look like and I said 'OK Dad you're looking the part, have you ever done it before'? That just happened. My heart went out to your little brother.\"\nIn his video, the clown admits he is afraid to change.\n\"And at first you were like 'ah no and look at me and you've still got it,'\" he continues, but also admits he needs to look very good.\nIt was unclear on why the girl stopped talking during the video and the clown was not even given the chance to explain what happened.\nAt the time of the video, the girl told NBC News that she wanted to keep silent.\n\"I've watched many years of this, and it's all I really want to talk about,\" the little clown continues. \"I said to her I'm scared of what can happen to me.\"\nWKOW is hoping that people are less frightened of telling the child what is likely to happen to them if they do not tell the clown.\nCopyright 2017 WKOW (Meredith Corporation).

The store has a full line of books and everything from Harry Potter books to Harry Potter books to Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.\n\nIt makes it one of my favorite places in town. I also got to keep up with the school kids doing their homework while there, and watch them get a lot done as well.\n\nHere are the photos of the new store on the second floor :\n\nI've really gotten a good look at the new store on the second floor :\n\nIt is really the only mall I will ever visit, and I really really want to get more than one. I also want to try to try to do a long walk through my front yard or get some sun time - and some time to take some pictures.\n\nThe new store opening\n\nSo here is the first peek from the new store,\n\nI will be back in less than a week to get a better pic.

You can only be depressed when you feel so little. To the extent of doing the right thing, it's not because everything else is crap. But to all those who are really insecure about you, how can you be good to them, just because you feel a little self-worthlessness when you are depressed? Even when you are depressed is the only time you will ever have to do anything that really hurts, even if you don't need it anymore. It just makes you feel sad and useless.\nI'm sure that some Christians see you as some kind of bad angel, and you're always the one being good to them.\nYeah I totally relate. And I'd feel sad if I was really good to others. I mean, I just hate my job because I don't do jobs worth a damn. I know I don't deserve one right now but I still feel bad because... well, I think I've done enough good to deserve it.\nI completely agree that your depression might not be the end of the world. However, it certainly doesn't excuse your sad, useless attitude. It can and should take time.\nSure, I know, but it's easy to get depressed if you don't have a job. But I have a job as well, maybe I'll be able to get into my field of interests and give someone else another chance... And maybe I'll do a whole lot more good things.\nYou might know what depression is like. I'm not even sure if that's a thing.\nYes it is.\nYou may have some other ideas.

{"id":2959,"ended":true,"length":418,"text":"Three terrifying images to choose from!\n\nThe most terrifying images to choose from.\n\nThe photographs above are from the world premiere of The Man Who Came to Life by Stephen King. There are quite a few of these images that you may be interested in \u2013 they are quite possibly of the most frightening images out there. So, without further ado, here are three of the stunningest images that you might find very scary.\n\n1. The Night\n\nThis one really is one of Stephen King's best works. It is one of the most terrifying images that Stephen King himself has made. It has very little to do with the actual book, as it is set in a town you live in. However, it is about an ancient town with the name \"the night\", in the UK. It seems that Stephen King has chosen to focus on that town in this image, and use that name in the title of the novel. The Night is an image we have all wanted to see in a book for years or even decades. The images above don't lie anywhere in the book and Stephen King chose to focus on that town.\n\n2. Laughter\n\nAnother image that Stephen King has really used to make his art is the laughter scene. If it is a city in the UK, you can probably guess that the laughter scene is probably of a horror sort. There are quite a few of these images that Stephen King chose to use which are very scary. I don't think the laughter scene is the most terrifying thing that Stephen King has done in his books, so the ones that you might find very scary.\n\n3. Dancers\n\nThese images have been made many times over the years. Their most scary thing is that they are made on the basis of real dancers like the ones that we see in the movies of the time. Not to be too dramatic, but they actually give the impression that they are dancing in the midst of actual bodies.\n\nWhen are you going to watch the movie Stephen King\u2019s The Man Who Came to Life?\n\nHave you ever wanted to see some new content from Stephen King?

Alice is always thinking that she will do something special for a child, even if it is not in any other language but English.\n\nWooWoo!\n\nIf you're a school-age child who is struggling with how to write a poem, this book may be right for you.\n\nIf you have a specific poem or poem you would like to share, or any stories you wish to share, let me know.","token_len":446,"entropy":[9.1178,12.6624,9.188,10.9121,5.3269,0.8723,7.5295,9.1092,1.6786,0.1817,3.3094,4.8594,1.4783,1.9799,2.7944,0.015,7.0041,4.2084,2.1347,4.4489,0.3644,0.9654,2.0908,1.1496,6.5083,4.2975,2.3449,5.9934,2.3368,1.6843,2.2863,4.9029,4.0512,3.4522,0.2819,5.0872,4.9081,4.2856,2.6374,2.7826,2.5529,2.4167,6.2403,2.4638,1.5068,3.3631,7.2676,3.4206,0.2762,4.8083,1.1527,5.2905,3.8709,3.628,0.294,9.4381,2.5717,3.443,3.4589,3.4395,0.1454,5.2262,7.4535,0.0153,0.7345,5.8729,2.5405,2.1467,2.5036,4.8306,2.3611,4.3726,0.855,5.4465,0.5633,3.3578,2.1706,2.6383,1.6539,5.7038,4.0437,2.0368,3.0782,1.0981,4.4002,5.0964,1.2815,2.3453,5.3034,5.135,1.4035,4.6814,5.0312,4.9482,5.413,0.6349,4.4501,0.7888,2.0817,3.268,5.4156,0.3075,1.5797,4.1828,4.2806,1.5251,1.469,3.1228,0.3471,4.3486,0.5951,1.9572,4.0814,0.9347,3.3651,3.3473,0.5289,4.9012,9.6705,13.5515,8.2876,0.9297,7.2684,0.7496,2.4618,4.8436,3.5295,4.5613,4.1737,0.1074,1.513,4.8872,2.601,4.491,6.2598,3.2818,1.9277,6.9021,0.7218,3.2761,5.9516,3.7322,7.826,5.6201,1.8778,2.8387,3.6504,3.5444,6.1892,0.8611,4.0755,6.2999,4.1403,3.7082,4.4816,1.3033,2.0504,2.5176,5.2726,2.2405,5.3922,0.9775,4.3098,1.9208,0.8797,1.3092,1.9928,1.1633,0.8546,3.9356,2.0102,3.4296,3.7257,5.4321,1.2558,3.3413,3.8374,1.8635,2.8451,2.0437,2.8409,1.4433,1.7049,3.29,0.5709,1.1976,1.1959,2.0111,3.7343,4.7362,4.3452,4.5319,4.2555,3.8802,0.3138,2.0701,0.0046,3.459,1.183,0.7092,1.6387,3.1055,0.027,1.2913,0.0952,0.4994,0.1919,0.0116,0.0465,0.0097,0.0108,0.0381,0.3486,0.2378,0.01,0.0094,0.0249,0.0042,0.001,0.0335,0.0076,0.0005,0.0024,0.0007,0.0068,0.002,0.0012,0.0011,0.002,0.0014,0.024,0.0014,0.0026,0.0052,0.0028,0.0017,0.0012,0.0044,0.0012,0.0102,0.0107,0.0028,1.1067,0.0797,0.0036,0.1159,0.0007,0.0004,0.0012,0.0003,0.0001,0.0025,0.0063,0.0142,0.001,0.0011,0.0054,0.0006,0.0028,0.0011,0.0026,0.0015,0.0002,0.0008,0.0022,0.002,0.0005,0.0007,0.0017,0.0062,0.0013,0.0022,0.0019,0.0025,0.0058,0.0003,0.0028,0.0008,0.0026,0.002,0.0006,0.0002,0.0043,0.0067,0.0034,0.0012,0.0019,0.0088,0.0004,0.0006,0.0009,0.0068,0.0016,0.0006,0.0028,0.0004,0.0016,0.001,0.0016,0.0011,0.0011,0.004,0.0008,0.0007,0.002,0.0182,0.0149,0.0025,0.0055,0.0033,0.0007,0.0078,0.0001,0.0063,0.0038,0.0021,0.0005,0.0011,0.0007,0.0018,0.006,0.0006,0.0006,0.0015,0.0118,0.0011,0.0093,0.0011,0.0027,0.002,0.0002,0.0019,0.0016,0.0049,0.0016,0.0074,0.0009,3.2593,0.8888,0.0063,0.0139,0.0068,0.0007,0.0018,0.0036,0.0019,0.0009,0.0028,0.0051,0.0011,0.0032,0.0022,0.0003,0.0018,0.0011,0.0008,0.2174,0.0045,0.0013,0.0007,0.0015,0.0593,0.0018,0.0033,0.0014,0.0004,0.0009,0.0036,0.0015,0.0007,0.0005,0.0033,0.0006,0.0027,0.005,0.0007,0.0021,0.0004,0.0024,0.0038,0.0021,0.0032,1.352,0.0001,6.5119,5.1873,5.396,0.1553,2.6476,1.1307,0.0002,4.8407,0.3131,2.4761,1.8962,5.6272,4.1298,1.2013,1.046,1.7925,1.7438,2.9081,0.695,4.3419,0.0525,2.3581,1.6408,1.3215,0.6675,1.5275,0.5988,2.9601,0.7009,4.4516,0.1199,0.0053,0.1574,3.0523,0.0002,3.0252,0.0403,4.7901,1.4219,4.8048,4.3213,2.0572,2.0076,3.8384,1.7503,0.061,0.3216,0.8428,0.8325,3.0647,4.6021,4.209,0.6339,3.6007,0.1466,0.3196,0.704,3.8101,0.9631,0.0054,1.2628]}

It's now a bit of a new thing for the band to do with Fallen Glantz after their previous record, \"What You Want.\"\nThe album will be out Nov. 29, 2022 on Blending Recordings.\nOn Sept. 23, he wrote two songs for the album: One was \"In Your Face\" that featured his own music video for \"Ride With Me,\" while the other was \"On Your Face\" that featured his song \"Singing With Me.\"\n\"What you want to hear out of music is you wanting to talk to people or you want to hear them smile and smile in your face,\" Glantz said. \"That's where we found our power here and we've been really lucky in that.\"\nFellow guitarist and frontman Matt Elam, who signed to Blending Recordings and is a professional singer, talked about playing with the group.\n\"A lot of the guys do a lot of things differently than they usually do in their day,\" Elam said. \"Just because they've played a lot of different music out there and been involved in other things of this sort, I just really love having them back with me. They do sound very different to me.\n\"The album kind of reflects how we feel right now. It's been a long year. We're always talking about the music and thinking of things we'd do differently this year, but we also find it exciting and exciting to have them back to us.\"\nFallen Glantz played the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and performed at concerts in Las Vegas and Detroit before going on tour for the band in March. He also has a music video for \"Out Of Your Mind\" and is a composer for four music videos for \"Coffee with the Gang.\"\nFallen Glantz says it's been his dream to be a part of the new album, and so it was fitting that he wrote his own video for \"There's Things You Need To Know About Me.\"","token_len":447,"entropy":[6.9156,7.9307,8.6997,3.3498,6.8264,5.8237,2.835,4.037,4.9824,2.2652,4.2327,7.5139,3.8947,7.7664,1.8387,6.5669,0.0083,0.149,0.0013,5.3212,2.048,1.4306,0.1001,5.4194,5.7435,7.6447,7.4373,5.5181,3.8442,1.8463,4.2347,0.0169,0.0634,0.001,3.2994,4.8952,1.7893,0.0765,2.3685,2.3654,1.6599,1.0552,2.1486,0.6722,5.9266,3.215,4.9881,1.2999,0.1898,5.9315,2.2866,1.9688,1.5917,0.7081,3.5209,1.3391,3.2893,11.3677,0.3446,0.0036,6.6135,3.1005,3.4902,2.5872,0.7718,1.8594,5.8652,3.0231,3.4488,2.1475,1.7848,1.8386,1.7321,3.1689,0.7111,1.8479,4.7116,0.004,3.4172,2.2201,10.8828,3.9422,5.568,6.0055,2.5681,0.0163,0.6766,1.3051,5.0771,5.5917,0.0049,3.4211,0.151,4.9845,3.3843,5.3906,1.3308,0.9922,1.4369,1.383,2.5866,4.7338,3.8945,1.9098,4.8679,3.79,2.2479,1.2805,4.103,4.0063,3.4559,3.6504,4.9533,3.5185,1.2735,1.2368,5.0416,3.157,3.3489,0.2801,0.6066,2.8987,0.1651,0.1645,0.3611,0.786,5.343,2.3483,4.6161,1.5147,1.0469,0.8023,1.3985,3.74,0.8658,4.6026,5.3285,2.3079,1.3877,0.4402,0.5251,1.5557,4.3472,0.9909,0.0404,1.9129,2.0261,5.6118,0.6945,5.5916,0.6859,5.0097,7.0853,0.4402,5.2821,1.7612,1.5782,4.5483,1.9154,0.1861,0.2253,3.0034,2.5592,6.0344,1.9146,3.8662,4.5578,2.0738,1.3405,0.7587,3.3925,0.0004,0.7519,0.8355,0.3449,2.3453,0.2785,3.2209,1.9895,4.1902,1.6009,5.6946,5.5169,2.7691,1.7603,2.9427,1.2983,3.5644,2.8546,2.9383,1.1141,2.7009,0.1224,5.3018,3.1476,3.2476,3.1871,5.5641,3.2671,0.1803,0.0001,2.2584,0.4959,5.3009,1.6636,2.3572,0.2728,0.5715,0.0002,3.9538,2.2047,2.964,8.0198,3.2067,1.4781,5.782,0.3232,4.7255,1.3161,1.6704,2.7133,1.9439,0.4375,0.3367,5.077,0.2416,0.0247,1.6171,2.9076,5.7675,2.3395,0.3434,0.0682,3.3044,4.8134,1.3633,2.6744,3.089,0.128,3.3335,1.7678,3.2017,4.3057,0.4884,0.0002,0.064,0.1372,0.0479,5.9249,2.2779,1.8702,2.8987,3.1109,1.8694,1.0175,0.3338,1.0977,2.3529,6.9922,1.4968,2.3801,4.2464,4.4505,0.5044,4.4981,1.4991,6.4005,3.7892,2.0656,1.084,2.7961,4.3039,3.7259,2.8556,4.2775,1.5941,3.545,3.2616,1.0709,1.3195,2.2921,4.6628,6.0085,3.6921,0.8627,2.4575,0.8649,1.6385,3.0711,0.2595,3.1481,4.3158,5.4139,0.0017,4.7691,3.3506,1.789,2.2675,4.8031,0.0197,1.7056,1.7564,0.4472,3.5358,1.0323,1.656,4.8951,2.6429,1.3273,1.2947,4.956,4.2693,0.1763,2.3139,3.5608,1.3846,5.9723,4.1193,2.7914,2.3884,2.1749,3.5075,0.6258,5.2979,1.0432,1.7459,1.3033,1.5733,4.3067,5.3693,2.706,3.362,2.4117,2.3132,0.5905,2.517,1.6767,0.4069,4.2779,2.162,1.7938,0.1297,2.0837,0.0017,0.0172,0.0016,4.6332,2.8005,6.7894,1.2029,0.0314,0.0246,0.0851,0.017,3.658,5.1611,1.3876,5.6572,2.2211,4.0435,0.001,1.3663,4.237,2.5092,3.7882,0.5383,2.9153,3.7303,1.262,1.4322,1.5947,4.7247,1.041,1.7403,1.968,3.5666,1.3499,5.6083,0.2243,0.6369,0.905,5.3718,1.9903,1.9867,0.9328,1.2625,1.8902,2.2599,2.444,6.3533,0.9994,5.7805,5.6057,0.6457,0.9243,1.8444,4.497,4.7819,0.2487,3.1701,2.4365,7.3941,0.659,0.5028,2.0628,0.0025,0.0998,0.0022,4.7291,3.7561,0.554,1.6637,4.9501,1.2777,0.3194,2.6956,1.047,2.7964,0.0009,1.311,3.2586,2.1155,1.9614,1.8219,5.807,2.8984,2.0731,3.3256,0.7875,0.5835,5.3585,2.8883,1.4638,4.4258,0.4057,0.8802,7.479,0.6702,7.0666,1.3996,3.0152,0.9555,1.3433,0.5051,2.8255,1.0174]}

The author describes each of the characters, while offering a complete breakdown of their personalities, including how the characters react to the \"evil\" act \u2013 including the names of the killers, what the killer plans to do next.\n\nIn addition, one of the characters, the killer, is a very specific target and has a unique personality and social interaction.\n\nThe book begins with a rape rape in the small town where the killer was working when he got home from work. The killer describes her and his intentions in the book.

Bob Johnson in Littleton, where the rape was committed.\n\nIn the story also include his love life that he finds with the girlfriend.

{"id":1562,"ended":true,"length":415,"text":"Humans are widely regarded as the most beautiful species in the galaxy. We don't know this.\nI don't know what kind of \"flesh\" a species can be, but that species has huge legs, huge breasts, a huge forehead, and a large tusk.\nThey can be \"fleshier\" than the average human (or at least the average ape ).    And yes, they can be \"skinier\" than average human.\nThe average human is like 70% female and 30% male.  That being said, the average human is also pretty good at making things up (i.e. the average human is probably average), because men have more hormones as well as sex to help with the 'average' part - there was no need to \"cut them\" either.\nThere are *plenty* of human beings that are at or above the average human and that is in most areas of nature.   The average ape is about 100% male.    A typical human being with a healthy amount of hormones, or at least enough of them, would be about 70% female.  It's the human being who needs to be conscious that his body is \"skinier\".\nI don't even really understand how you can be an average human and not be 100% fat.\nBecause the human being you're writing about is being fat.    Humans are known for being able to use less calories for many of the same reasons that you listed.\nHow the fuck can you possibly be the \"worst\" a human being can be? That man has a bigger penis than any other male of any species and his penis is more than double what it once was (though that penis still weighs a ton so it can still be the most powerful thing on earth).       I don't believe you're the \"worst\" human of all time, but the average human is *not* the worst human.\nDo you have any evidence to support your claim so far?\nI would be proud to.      That *is* anecdotal though.\nFair enough, what's the science behind you doing that anyway?\nIt's actually more like statistics.","token_len":457,"entropy":[7.039,1.7652,7.7897,2.2056,0.1652,1.2003,1.3636,5.1119,2.2609,1.8087,0.2213,2.8538,0.9553,3.8713,4.5181,0.0007,1.4457,5.8169,2.9177,1.9918,10.1339,3.1219,0.0006,1.1657,1.4232,3.7534,0.0017,5.245,4.6922,2.5919,0.9287,4.5168,3.3631,3.6917,2.5334,1.2791,0.7454,4.0181,7.0002,2.4176,6.9789,6.3837,1.2661,2.4813,3.853,0.2847,3.8758,2.1168,5.4909,0.4069,1.0953,1.7179,3.005,6.6616,3.231,0.7738,2.0439,4.0083,2.4871,2.1297,5.7661,2.4839,0.294,6.386,0.3301,0.4188,2.8172,1.8003,0.4744,4.2117,3.0189,3.0105,0.0272,3.1344,1.0576,4.6788,7.8194,6.7957,6.0581,1.4373,4.4647,5.5047,0.0796,1.7132,1.6909,1.025,2.2517,3.7524,0.2515,0.5093,0.2033,3.5803,1.1396,1.315,1.2139,2.9076,3.7993,0.4626,1.6861,5.0222,6.4416,1.1556,5.7749,2.0986,2.9072,0.0293,0.2337,0.5495,0.8122,6.4915,5.0535,0.027,0.0429,2.3338,0.2973,0.7951,1.2599,3.0911,4.0611,3.2735,0.3952,4.1121,6.0882,2.0882,3.279,4.1649,0.0118,0.0003,0.6333,3.6989,1.3829,1.1697,1.5363,4.0338,5.3018,4.7602,5.2309,5.0837,2.3598,2.6687,5.7075,6.0179,0.8232,0.6236,4.8317,7.0405,3.0175,3.3212,2.4933,6.6061,6.9721,0.3483,5.0804,5.8539,4.7974,4.8275,2.2268,3.9411,0.6105,4.5546,4.5104,3.2132,2.6054,6.1802,0.4418,0.7585,3.8634,0.7454,9.3838,8.1193,0.0402,0.02,0.4645,3.9604,3.0318,1.7737,1.1918,5.2589,4.3138,1.2895,1.9898,0.6809,1.4521,3.6129,2.3773,2.0109,5.4718,4.1551,5.3827,0.7745,5.7282,0.5582,1.0398,0.6362,3.2603,1.228,5.7213,0.7708,2.4562,3.9396,0.1418,1.3567,2.0401,0.3762,0.4998,1.4404,4.533,4.9396,0.566,3.1777,4.7688,1.2237,5.5358,4.6611,0.012,2.7398,2.8802,4.5849,2.6478,0.1549,4.219,3.4423,1.1718,1.3589,2.3459,0.9305,1.4035,3.1291,0.1912,0.4873,0.5626,0.5876,5.2003,1.0787,4.1863,4.6241,3.2937,2.3444,3.3201,0.9901,1.0368,7.3032,4.2527,5.3333,1.3741,1.0696,3.549,2.6762,0.6234,1.9211,0.878,2.7749,2.0802,0.0008,4.085,4.3812,1.9491,1.5034,2.8369,0.7769,2.8252,4.857,0.5464,0.3236,1.2877,0.9195,1.2006,4.9884,0.0363,6.1629,0.9184,1.7702,5.3323,2.8245,3.0936,1.1214,6.0735,1.6889,6.2679,0.1207,0.5947,6.25,2.2028,2.1752,1.0591,0.3725,1.3346,4.4197,0.612,5.6948,1.3605,0.8666,4.4037,0.0019,4.4669,6.9163,3.342,4.7846,6.7142,3.3626,1.1385,0.8526,0.729,1.4978,3.7112,8.6085,1.2097,2.1418,4.7889,4.6607,2.8339,2.3231,0.77,2.6122,0.902,4.0872,2.4095,4.4095,1.771,6.4091,0.4453,0.2064,3.9128,0.1519,0.3836,5.3071,6.5232,2.5837,1.7324,6.0044,3.1587,0.5317,2.3392,1.1786,4.7846,5.0412,1.3796,1.3912,4.02,2.9524,2.2562,0.685,4.1369,1.6467,3.4698,2.7779,2.1444,5.5626,0.0206,3.287,4.6978,2.8179,3.6036,3.7062,4.989,2.2585,1.6544,6.1076,1.367,3.2803,3.6778,0.7173,4.627,2.1428,3.8104,2.7549,1.7258,1.388,0.7004,0.81,0.1918,0.9657,2.4771,2.1792,1.126,4.3133,2.4824,0.001,3.9758,2.4036,2.4497,2.8757,2.1982,0.4531,0.4426,1.871,6.9739,0.4697,0.1424,1.6957,1.0552,4.031,2.1136,0.3312,1.3556,6.4235,2.4986,0.0141,0.9801,0.6932,0.9007,1.6853,0.9508,5.2394,0.3797,2.8316,0.6577,4.5061,2.2979,0.9346,2.0626,1.1552,7.4137,0.169,0.3254,1.4733,1.4823,4.149,3.014,6.2094,0.7087,3.5416,0.8214,0.1452,0.4553,0.6115,0.6305,5.8055,6.4416,4.0007,0.1475,9.9128,6.1964,0.6093,1.0837,8.4157,0.2806,1.4763,5.4697,2.8129,1.3288,4.2955,0.5478,3.9308,5.2238,1.1361,6.5261,0.1587,0.7068,3.7935,0.5339,4.6215,4.6065,2.974,7.5462,0.9145]}

Chaos ensues.\n\nThe Daily Mail, yesterday, reported that Facebook has a new 'faulty' list of users that it will ask for a photograph of before their data-sharing with the world is stolen. \"This is now being asked for for those users who are using the platform for personal personal data. And because the database contains personal data, Facebook said it will ask users' photos as part of its data collection on them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The new information will only be shared when Facebook has informed users if they had used personal data to support their own use in certain ways. Once more private companies like Facebook turn to this service they are not alone in giving out their personal data \u2014 and this can be really embarrassing,\" the Mail reports. \"It has also proven that Facebook itself has an enormous privacy scandal and that personal data are sometimes lost through misuse, which may include personally identifiable information.\"\n\nFacebook has been known to ask users who give in to these requests for photos or data for up to five years. The paper also reports that users have long been warned how private data may contain personal details that could hurt their users.\n\nFacebook confirmed that it was removing the data under the 'privacy' category of its page before it was made public. \"In fact, we know that the people we care about want to know about who has used Facebook's site for for many of the past 18 months. Since we started tracking the growth habits of Facebook users in late 2012, we have found the site to be full of these kinds of requests for pictures and details, and we have seen the site become much more frequently used than initially thought.\"\n\nWe are currently awaiting the next update from the government to make any changes to Facebook's privacy standards - and if any change is needed we will update. We thank all of our supporters for the support we have now received.\n\nWe want to thank everyone who has supported us in the last weeks - and even if you do not agree with everything we have said as a result of this announcement, please do. We hope you are enjoying the stories you will find at the Daily Mail.

Several people from the crowd gathered outside the restaurant saying something to the contrary.\n\nOne of the people allegedly offended by the alleged \u201cpenny grab\u201d, was said to have broken up with a customer after ordering a coffee for another and that he was feeling \u201cbored\u201d and felt as if he only got so much if he had left.\n\nThe man had reportedly also ordered a \u201cpenny grab\u201d as to stop him from making the alleged \u201cgrab\u201d at a table.\n\nAccording to a report by the Daily Mail, the man said that he was tired of the alleged grab and felt like eating in the restaurant.\n\nAs a result, the witness reportedly ordered a cup of his coffee to try and calm him down and asked him to \u201clet go\u201d of the grabbing and to stop shouting at his man.\n\nHe also attempted to intervene briefly and made one comment to the contrary, while another witness reportedly heard \u201ca scream\u201d.\n\nIn regards to his report, the man said although the alleged incident was not a major issue on his end, he had to \u201csadly\u201d accept the incident and apologise to other customers.\n\nThe incident was reported on the 4th of June (day after a tweet was shared regarding the alleged incident).

{"id":4054,"ended":false,"length":411,"text":"A Man, a Broom, and the End of the World\n\nThe book is a collection of essays written by Richard Dawkins, a highly rated philosopher, author and linguist, who coined the term \u201cancient-style\u201d. He is an expert in the theory of intelligent beings, and believes that every sentient being on the planet we live on has a basic intelligence. It is also an intelligent creator of everything and everything.\n\nThe book has received a positive and negative rating from readers of The Telegraph and elsewhere, and has won the National Book Prize for the best essay from Dawkins.\n\n\u201cI am delighted with the book\u2019s success.

{"id":2235,"ended":false,"length":415,"text":"Write an epic-adventure short story where the tool that saves the day is a toothpick... [\u2026]\n\nWritten by: Paul McEntee\n\nCrown, the world\u2019s first fantasy series, has just announced that it will be making the world famous \u2013 through the hands of four people involved in creative writing (aka, readers!).\n\nIn a press release, Crown says it believes that writers, designers, and editors don\u2019t need to be involved in any setting and that it will give \u201can amazing new opportunity to learn as a person about how we create.\u201d\n\nThe team behind Crown, which also won the Creative Writing Academy Awards as Best Animation at the 2017 NAB Show, is part of the creative industry at large. As we all know, a lot of creative writing is always a struggle, but there\u2019s always something new and interesting to find in new ideas.\n\nAs a result, Crown has expanded its Creative Writing Academy selection offering to include creators who are willing to give work to a company that offers great creative writing, as well as creators who want to take on a professional work-life balance.\n\nSo far, this is only the start\n\n\u2018We really need more writers. More writers, more writers, more writers...\u2019 says Jason Jorgensen, creative editor of Crown. He says: \u201cThe creative industry is incredibly diverse, but also many of the creative voices who are leading those voices are not at home in that kind of world.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the creative industry has certainly had its share of challenges recently, but Crown is one of the most diverse creative industries on the planet. While the most innovative and prolific of writers has yet to emerge, the creative industry is growing.\n\nCreative writers have become a bigger priority than ever, with major writers like Mark Hamill, David Tennant, Peter Molyneux, and Emma Watson all looking to further develop their craft alongside their best peers.\n\n\u2018Crown has had a lot of challenges trying to fit in, and it seems that it\u2019s helped by the fact that it\u2019s really been an inspiring opportunity for us as a writers community to really get to know each other.\u2019","token_len":465,"entropy":[6.0257,8.9523,5.5549,6.9751,0.0194,5.9044,0.707,6.2025,2.034,11.5569,4.6634,3.8622,1.8102,0.7369,1.0368,2.0598,8.1583,2.8243,5.3074,10.5488,1.6062,0.0025,7.1271,0.2109,2.554,5.1384,5.6472,4.7426,0.4317,0.9931,0.0002,5.6263,5.7923,5.4839,4.3257,4.421,14.1265,8.6635,4.0309,2.3427,4.8434,3.0917,1.1372,2.5151,3.4966,3.9293,1.4119,0.8211,0.918,0.9365,3.0991,3.2492,4.4301,4.9224,6.3071,5.3218,2.0203,5.0394,0.0684,6.9218,3.5747,8.0353,0.6503,6.9065,1.5542,4.5281,5.1468,2.5506,7.0821,2.9308,1.883,0.0002,3.2377,2.3077,2.2435,0.1475,0.5446,0.8228,2.8154,2.1093,6.7069,1.3286,5.5557,3.3577,3.8471,0.5024,1.0244,3.7765,7.6281,7.5812,1.9418,0.5753,1.6923,0.5932,1.5903,4.7262,0.742,3.2218,6.9096,3.6431,1.2414,1.8188,1.9967,3.9312,8.9923,4.7043,3.2894,3.8224,4.1229,2.974,0.6378,5.6963,4.5578,4.0445,4.5738,1.9833,2.5604,3.0713,2.0226,2.5825,4.7898,6.8998,0.5628,0.0002,2.2669,4.0888,0.7519,0.7388,2.2424,2.0743,3.8798,5.848,0.9356,6.2126,0.116,6.2871,3.8686,5.4553,2.0705,6.1194,3.0744,0.6171,3.0743,5.4119,2.4451,5.5757,2.3051,2.3279,4.6385,0.0304,0.9436,3.7115,6.0362,3.216,1.2686,1.2435,4.2736,3.5547,3.3799,0.068,0.1387,3.9138,1.7097,0.1482,3.1723,0.9808,1.0853,5.78,1.8777,3.4156,1.3811,1.8391,3.5973,3.4577,0.6108,2.0616,2.4225,2.4922,2.3144,1.9717,2.2888,0.9128,3.82,2.0335,4.9719,4.7116,0.5424,1.0462,0.0001,4.0653,1.8354,1.3166,0.2535,2.117,1.9737,6.1366,1.1159,5.3602,0.1123,1.2759,6.6154,8.7106,1.4563,2.6992,3.9806,1.9233,1.5561,5.4132,0.0637,3.4875,4.9326,0.3589,2.3099,4.9856,1.5798,4.4296,4.3955,2.4844,0.2029,2.4647,3.0274,0.0631,0.0088,2.4536,0.2719,1.8787,0.1355,3.5674,2.2248,1.3959,6.385,4.5946,3.507,0.8842,0.0861,0.801,0.4448,0.0001,4.2769,3.6673,0.298,3.6851,1.961,3.5979,0.5104,2.7088,6.9061,0.0001,5.5158,5.2891,4.5051,6.2351,2.9321,2.0764,2.5116,2.6656,4.4302,2.0551,3.34,0.8712,2.3785,1.4225,0.3031,0.3736,6.1854,2.3448,2.0143,9.7364,7.4798,5.7172,3.0846,0.2026,0.3453,3.7834,2.6906,1.2036,0.2116,0.384,3.3838,1.746,2.695,3.7163,3.0208,2.714,3.2662,3.0547,0.7937,4.8999,1.6361,1.143,2.4343,4.8354,6.4709,1.6419,1.2341,3.7372,4.2957,3.4276,1.9252,5.6357,4.8427,2.6219,0.8693,2.3637,5.0495,4.9086,0.6325,3.4774,4.8541,0.0004,2.6547,0.3233,2.22,1.7203,0.4309,0.0001,6.1084,0.0422,2.4224,2.7447,2.0313,2.0786,5.3163,3.6174,1.8397,0.9801,0.0068,2.3473,3.7148,1.0151,2.243,1.574,1.3064,3.485,0.2761,1.0127,2.0665,3.3623,3.9858,0.9996,2.2323,0.3132,0.2042,0.4018,4.3717,2.2039,4.9223,4.7132,1.7168,4.8686,2.3034,3.8666,3.2919,3.5448,0.0079,2.9183,0.6073,1.9262,1.9898,1.3343,1.0312,3.5475,2.4555,0.9222,0.0001,5.8606,0.1533,2.7004,2.1641,3.4414,1.8069,5.3836,5.8555,1.729,0.3809,1.4426,2.5601,5.8645,3.9199,2.2008,3.5603,4.3021,0.0007,1.081,3.426,4.7552,0.0001,0.1727,5.0783,5.1446,0.0642,0.0004,0.0019,0.2315,1.0844,6.5265,2.0263,2.3318,4.7304,0.496,6.2149,3.2071,0.071,2.1747,7.9252,1.618,5.8105,5.3485,0.3208,0.6362,0.0001,1.9303,0.607,3.5859,0.0161,2.1979,4.6863,1.229,2.9285,0.1214,4.6322,5.4055,0.0325,5.5496,2.0386,2.4556,1.8907,2.3797,3.1836,1.1994,2.6927,3.5171,0.6271,0.1697,7.2155,1.8155,0.9218,1.4165,0.0147,2.2542,1.8857,0.2492,0.0133,5.4039,4.8786,2.8278,4.455,4.6257,0.7111,2.1753,3.5775,1.3691,4.6571,1.4893,1.1498,4.7834,2.5809,1.1426,0.2138,1.3872,0.0174,1.0392,1.033,2.92]}
{"id":2106,"ended":false,"length":1020,"text":"A person with multiple personality disorder falls into a coma. Inside their mind, the personalities fight for sole control for when they wake up in the morning, when they want sleep. They have to sleep peacefully into the night, sometimes even to wake up, usually while they are at work. There are so many, many things in their existence, that when they fall into a coma, sometimes they can remember so much. The same thing applies to bipolar, obsessive, bipolar, borderline, or anything else,. There are so many different kinds of bipolar, and all of them play a significant role in mental illness and how we experience themselves. Sometimes, the way you fall into a coma, is by falling back asleep on your own, or falling asleep on the corner to your bed,or by falling in front of others to a dark place, or by falling asleep while you are out drinking. This is also true for all people, except those that fall into bipolar and can remember,. These thoughts that happen in the sleep deprivation stage of psychosis, also include the ones we have experienced before with bipolar, where we can remember so much and only remember certain things. Then there are the thoughts that you have with the other side of the brain like how much you enjoy drinking, or the thoughts that you wish your friends in the world would always be around, because that is what you are. The most famous bipolar symptom, called the \"Nightmare\" of Bipolar syndrome, is of course, a personality disorder, where when people do not want to sleep, they become very depressed, become suicidal and eventually die. When we get into a panic, the next thing we know, everything in our brains begins to drift away from each other, and into a normal consciousness. It is such a powerful condition, that we are so obsessed with it, that the brain becomes a mirror, we want to see what can be achieved,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, },,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,","token_len":468,"entropy":[7.6762,3.2063,6.0867,6.0576,0.1899,8.4539,0.8309,2.1799,7.4993,1.8949,10.166,3.9792,3.5317,0.4991,1.9484,6.7304,9.7454,1.645,12.6368,0.6509,6.3256,6.7755,1.0056,4.3292,0.135,3.5263,0.4887,1.1493,1.6908,1.9215,0.5203,4.1487,5.9089,3.0799,2.7899,2.8927,2.3111,5.0686,5.8689,5.7857,0.6519,0.4127,1.1856,4.6716,2.4376,2.8675,2.4153,0.2807,3.6541,5.0389,4.7495,1.9899,0.8561,4.7412,0.6575,0.9637,4.6018,0.7134,5.2622,0.037,6.4085,1.7259,4.0794,3.7591,1.9552,7.5499,2.0889,2.2879,4.1023,0.4924,3.0581,1.9297,1.1414,0.0338,0.4975,5.8734,0.7651,2.8388,6.0931,4.3482,0.6454,1.9331,2.9778,4.2733,2.6762,5.1186,0.2333,5.3234,2.8463,4.5173,3.0155,4.8783,0.4954,3.966,0.4521,2.8213,4.3683,0.9897,12.9707,3.6403,0.6467,1.7045,0.0186,1.9727,2.5005,0.0228,3.5905,1.4316,2.9618,3.9352,0.9017,0.2461,6.4486,0.8641,4.0543,0.2675,0.1372,5.5661,0.8096,2.9426,3.8389,1.6453,3.8383,8.1638,0.3593,4.9595,2.0711,2.3319,4.1107,2.6083,5.3387,0.1942,0.5334,0.4688,3.9447,1.8582,4.6272,5.2762,4.6259,2.8373,4.0589,1.7252,0.5696,1.7725,1.3832,5.481,1.0913,1.7659,1.9169,7.435,5.5921,1.9575,3.4027,1.524,9.115,1.3318,1.9537,3.7614,3.8635,0.0088,4.871,2.7513,4.9905,5.0769,1.3464,1.4367,0.8698,0.8676,1.0757,1.7094,3.3162,1.5077,0.8635,4.5172,4.5969,1.7064,3.5225,0.8775,4.2389,3.0099,0.8235,3.6723,3.0747,2.7839,4.2425,1.7637,3.1271,2.5362,0.5543,3.6744,3.1601,5.335,3.6408,13.9665,4.0277,5.4185,4.2982,4.605,1.7096,1.3494,4.6001,4.5206,3.5272,1.9746,4.9143,2.2822,5.1969,3.7973,2.4926,4.2834,3.6479,2.4995,2.4778,2.8412,4.404,2.2664,1.2653,6.3238,0.8694,2.3559,3.1441,2.79,0.1173,2.5442,5.5335,2.3506,4.0998,0.6741,1.3049,6.3119,1.3742,0.4613,0.8889,1.5351,0.5894,4.2106,1.8813,4.0562,2.6905,2.1082,3.9013,0.4264,0.5343,1.917,4.7193,6.1256,4.1364,1.2133,5.3179,4.5978,0.9688,1.067,3.3952,1.3317,0.4295,0.4606,6.478,2.9412,2.6251,5.9447,1.3706,3.9234,0.605,5.0294,1.26,2.8179,1.8296,3.942,2.646,1.1085,1.3217,1.7231,2.1491,1.644,2.8097,4.3333,4.2683,4.4386,5.3883,2.4898,3.3469,1.8598,1.8755,5.2551,0.3168,2.7619,3.4034,4.5571,0.0027,7.7392,0.3909,0.6497,5.7865,1.6134,2.0296,2.8654,6.8299,0.3562,1.5799,4.1797,4.8204,3.3006,4.3699,1.2231,3.0868,0.1984,2.5778,0.8041,0.3403,3.812,3.1053,2.3483,1.3792,6.1576,3.3644,2.8029,4.1537,1.8186,0.302,4.1184,2.6363,3.3676,1.4528,1.3287,3.8391,3.3106,3.0101,4.1795,0.9538,0.5531,1.8823,0.5682,5.3879,3.5342,0.4898,4.5581,5.6478,0.2187,7.2647,2.656,0.8945,4.727,0.0134,1.0167,0.8697,5.9039,1.6702,5.1771,6.1576,0.539,2.7672,0.7475,5.2433,0.2377,5.0269,4.9812,1.2019,1.2628,2.3569,2.4931,3.6857,5.3323,0.1528,1.0592,1.0543,0.3892,3.7401,4.4299,2.986,2.2735,4.9362,2.4568,5.5193,4.9864,0.3105,1.1239,2.3877,5.568,1.1447,4.8998,17.8634,2.9507,0.898,1.0298,0.9741,0.8639,0.7655,0.6916,0.6231,0.5761,0.5338,0.4995,0.4749,0.4513,0.4323,0.4166,0.408,0.3964,0.3836,0.3755,0.366,0.3592,0.3512,0.3438,0.3383,0.3326,0.3265,0.3222,0.3147,0.3116,0.3086,3.3272,8.1867,2.6904,0.2925,0.2993,0.3279,0.3556,0.3369,0.3035,0.267,0.2413,0.2183,0.2024,3.4983,4.9572,14.0572,0.1481,0.1623,0.2073,0.2037,0.202,0.2225,0.2409,0.2273,0.1936,0.159,0.1378,3.0613,1.3275,5.1427,1.3806,0.1188,0.1432,0.151,0.1609,0.1505,0.15,0.1723,0.2154,0.2573,0.2799,0.2836,0.2744,0.2588,0.2371,0.2178,0.2046,0.1954,0.1944,0.1971,2.9262,10.0818,0.8488,0.1134,0.1176,0.1289]}

{"id":1559,"ended":false,"length":458,"text":"As a gang initiation, the protagonist must execute an innocent man.\nI don't think gang initiation itself is an innocent man thing, just that gang initiation is the exact opposite. It's the same as getting caught up in a fight or having a robbery in an attempt to escape.  Like being on top of a truck, or someone stealing your truck.\nNo, because the point is that it's not the same thing as getting caught up in a fight like gang initiation because by that point you arent even being aware of the consequences of your actions.\nYes, but if you had caught up with the other gang members, you won't get caught in the fight.  If not, people would be pissed you were at them and are going to do whatever they need to do to get away.\nExactly, we'd be pissed too and end up committing more crimes and that would make it harder to get away if there were other gangs involved. That being said I agree that an innocent person should do the right thing. If you are a good and innocent person then you don't need to kill yourself. Otherwise it's the other way around.\nActually gang initiation is where you risk becoming the next victim.\nWhich means that I'd get caught up in their gang initiation as well. Because you end up being the next survivor, that's more likely than a random criminal who randomly murders your dad who got married last semester.  I do agree that an innocent person should do the right thing, but I don't think the law should dictate a gang initiation by its own rules.\nThat would be a huge change from the current legal system, and the existing way of doing things.\nI agree that it'd be a change, but I don't think that it would have a positive effect on society at large. I do like the current system, but I don't think it would change society significantly at all.\nThat's a really good point. I wasn't really clear to you about what I meant by \"a large change\". But the current legal system doesn't like me saying that because they're afraid of me to show my real faces.\nWhat you meant would be that it actually would be a major change, not just an immediate one.

{"id":496,"ended":true,"length":468,"text":"High and Dry, Warm, and Very Low\n\nI'm sure most of you can imagine that we, the people of Louisiana, have been working a lot lately, getting along quite well, and having fun out there. Well, now you can see why I did my part. For the last 24 hours, I've been running around, and enjoying every moment, in the garden with my husband. We have a good time, and I enjoy every minute of it. I'm glad he's home. I also want to keep up with the news, but the other good news here is that it was a great day for work last night. I wasn't able to make it tonight, but it's a good day. The weather was a little cold out, but the snowmen worked well too. And we all ate well and slept well in our tents, both of which made our last few days even better. I also want to apologize to everyone who's been in my life for the past few days. I wanted to say that I apologize to my family and friends for all the work that have been going on here; I apologize to the parish, my husband, and my friends in Dallas. I want to make it clear that we miss you all too. I apologize to everyone who has been in those years of this life, because I know your journey has been a roller coaster, but also because of the love, faith, and generosity of God who has been so helpful and loving during this time of recovery. We've learned from God's love in our midst, and now we're going to have fun in the garden with my friends while we're also in our tents. We've watched the weather, and the birds, and all the people in the garden are getting ready for the next round, but the important thing is that we've got time for the people who have been in our lives for generations. There hasn't been much of any activity going on this year, even though people are all working. So it's time to get ourselves out of the tent together, and do some gardening, while we still have time to go out in the garden. And, of course, enjoy the outdoors. If you need any help at all, or need advice about what to do, contact me, and I'll be there soon.","token_len":471,"entropy":[4.0124,5.6458,3.0244,6.8069,1.2971,1.7744,4.4205,4.1921,3.0495,0.0006,4.8437,3.329,3.0673,3.4707,0.8405,0.1703,4.044,2.0754,1.7787,3.8785,5.9418,1.6806,2.6198,1.1053,6.0367,0.2807,1.6548,1.2842,4.084,4.4941,0.7959,4.092,2.6035,4.4418,5.9429,3.5573,0.1836,1.0601,1.133,3.9462,2.1739,5.5418,0.8135,0.6313,4.1632,0.2412,3.7844,2.9972,1.7551,2.3775,1.6347,3.6431,6.0622,3.1356,1.4747,1.2276,4.7347,1.3066,1.8894,4.9064,0.5335,0.5454,0.7132,0.4767,0.2311,3.9504,2.9393,2.9333,2.9671,4.6585,3.497,2.3359,2.9668,4.2623,1.6073,5.965,3.0389,0.5212,3.4504,2.5611,2.3972,2.0372,1.8637,4.2551,1.8487,1.069,0.8941,1.7861,3.6495,2.6226,0.9654,0.3105,0.1615,0.3568,1.794,1.8903,4.3108,6.147,0.9502,3.5793,2.1305,1.7324,4.6445,2.6255,0.1135,5.5969,3.5623,0.6375,1.3572,2.1786,1.51,3.1405,3.725,4.6879,7.3178,0.1451,5.4204,0.2428,0.3612,3.5445,3.7053,1.7758,2.1739,1.864,1.4829,6.6188,5.3948,0.4905,0.6643,1.4848,5.8177,0.0008,1.4328,0.0016,3.7113,0.5133,5.8079,0.7448,0.8258,2.5915,1.7212,2.5889,1.4264,0.6557,1.5313,3.2137,1.8438,1.511,3.6536,0.976,2.7344,4.7882,2.3988,1.1288,2.3954,4.8432,8.1054,5.4542,2.8891,4.9829,0.4092,3.5501,2.88,3.573,4.9199,1.4144,3.1528,3.2075,0.0821,4.1648,2.3159,4.4551,2.0558,5.5629,2.0224,1.1481,4.3679,2.8546,5.0441,3.9085,0.5441,2.2825,0.5837,0.2279,2.0137,3.2993,2.7046,0.0169,5.1157,0.8913,2.3344,0.7548,2.8281,0.9824,3.7139,2.7833,2.0742,1.5871,0.8585,1.3698,1.9102,0.5317,0.819,1.0212,4.4765,0.1716,2.0359,2.1967,1.0229,5.4338,0.7237,2.2114,1.6294,1.1308,0.4244,1.1793,2.1745,0.807,3.6055,1.4934,6.3566,0.7029,3.5741,0.0333,3.7407,6.4809,1.8273,4.2737,0.5153,1.9543,6.4838,2.2824,2.2404,4.2531,0.3832,0.7642,1.6407,2.6306,3.6741,7.8046,1.5926,0.9077,2.1586,0.1456,3.1707,1.1669,1.187,0.4308,2.0746,6.7613,0.7661,1.4225,5.0051,2.0958,1.4755,4.7464,0.6196,1.6028,0.8794,1.2496,0.8075,2.1792,7.5007,4.9681,3.6609,5.4552,1.1243,1.066,3.982,1.5503,1.7167,4.3658,4.9662,1.8065,0.4631,1.6636,4.2749,0.578,2.1064,2.6251,3.7562,0.7532,1.8661,1.474,2.5307,2.704,4.425,0.2447,0.4667,4.0782,1.4588,2.936,2.7616,1.0627,2.0996,2.785,3.6421,1.8586,3.6575,4.273,1.1381,0.8988,1.9764,6.5195,0.2449,2.7016,3.4498,5.2819,2.9053,4.5065,1.7686,1.961,4.354,2.603,5.489,0.8755,0.3473,3.455,0.749,1.9563,1.3249,0.0555,3.0438,6.715,3.5653,1.072,2.2527,1.2109,4.7791,3.8531,5.733,0.3587,1.7956,6.2646,3.5283,2.4133,2.5021,0.5297,2.0686,2.4221,6.1742,1.4799,2.9455,2.5717,0.9725,2.1323,4.1227,1.3246,0.541,3.8139,0.8372,2.848,2.4144,0.6313,2.5023,5.7751,3.6237,1.9965,0.8485,0.9975,2.7774,3.4383,3.2406,3.0585,2.8934,6.4253,0.2452,0.5015,0.7696,0.5518,3.6279,2.015,3.5266,1.6969,2.2333,5.1458,2.3567,1.9365,0.3675,2.1923,1.4652,0.6358,1.1642,7.5379,1.3366,4.5738,6.0023,0.0002,0.0165,2.4356,2.4536,4.1528,4.1752,3.2208,0.0496,3.5222,2.8636,0.5944,5.889,1.0965,4.7599,0.6414,3.9262,2.9572,2.4064,2.8277,3.3272,0.3324,1.8095,0.5288,1.5658,6.7189,1.7343,0.2563,1.2082,4.6204,5.3977,1.4059,0.6296,4.3107,1.4325,2.9759,2.1683,4.8355,0.5321,4.0453,0.4972,0.7655,0.9075,3.6411,1.1454,3.2853,0.1767,1.9052,0.632,3.0059,3.5381,1.3551,0.0014,0.0269,4.3866,0.6657,3.489,1.3697,4.2203,0.2773,3.8087,1.5033,0.7414,4.8827,0.2102,0.2401,2.8737,2.8336,4.4554,2.2932,2.2134,0.5072,0.0839,1.0086,3.2049,1.1466,3.0706,2.2321,0.2459,0.4023,1.2263,3.2285,5.6747,0.5405]}
{"id":1425,"ended":true,"length":450,"text":"Centuries ago, humanity achieved immortality by uploading their minds into an infinite VR simulation. Now, one young mind has discovered physical reality and tries to convince others of it's existence.\n\nThe AI in the new VR simulation created a dream that a robot who is able to change into something different, will bring back a reality that was not there 100 years ago.\n\nThis simulation of the current year \u2013 2019 \u2013 has an impressive number of people working in space and time. But the AI says it believes that everything that is said in the past is true today. The AI has shown that nothing and that it never was there before.\n\nIf we consider reality to be only a dream which has nothing to do with real reality that we had back in the 1990s, but is only a dream as to why people can be alive today, how can we tell a real person who we are really with a dream from a dream that they didn\u2019t even believe in or is something that they had to go through or has happened to happen before?\n\nThe AI in the simulation also shows that the life that was before the AI was real can only be lived in time. The AI, therefore, hopes that in the coming year it\u2019s being shown that the past is indeed real and that the technology is not just for artificial intelligence as it is more than just the artificial world.\n\nAt the moment, science is not at all understood in any case. But the AI claims that it is one of \u201cfive thousand years\u201d old, only a few millennia old and maybe it may still evolve in the future.

{"id":392,"ended":true,"length":431,"text":"Aliens contact humanity and express their desire to trade. A convention is organized to show the aliens what earth has to offer. No one expects what the aliens are most interested in buying.\n\nThe Federation is determined to destroy humanity. Not sure a cure can be found, or even what might be, but its members have a plan. An alternative plan is to take over humanity and fight the Alien invasion of another galaxy. Their new strategy involves the creation of the world we live on. And because their plans are different, they can be compared to one another.\n\nThe Enterprise has the capabilities to attack all of humanity. And because humanity can attack the Enterprise, we can use only one force to win the race. The Force is too good to resist.\n\nFor a more detailed look at the Federation to this theory, be sure to read his previous book, Alien vs. Xenoblade Chronicles: The Wrath of Worlds.\n\nSo here\u2019s a little summary on the Alien vs. Xenoblade Chronicles novels:\n\nAs you can tell from the novel\u2019s first page, we have a number of unique elements. Some of them are hard to see, have interesting plot and characters but some are difficult to read. The other key element is the alien-fication factor. At first, the characters do not seem as intimidating as their predecessor. Then they get a little more intimidating and it makes you think they actually have a purpose.\n\nThe main reason why they are so strong against Xenoblade is because this is xenophobia. Xenoblade Chronicles: The Wrath of Worlds was created on the second and third-hand, but a few years before its release the authors decided to adapt it to the current system of fighting each other throughout the entire series.\n\nThis is not only for the first few chapters, but for many years to come.

{"id":2769,"ended":true,"length":445,"text":"He wanted to take his family camping, but when pitching the tent, noone noticed the toadstools ringing the campsite. Now, outside of the ring, something curious is happening...\n\nThe toadstools ringed the campsite a few minutes late. The next thing you know there was a ring of a small dog barking inside the campground, so they had their children outside. But now people are wondering if those wild dogs are what gave the village such a fright. And why are they around?\n\nThe ring of the dog is located very close to one of the villages on the Burda peninsula, just one hour from the Indian border. This village also has houses which are close to the village but the village only had one house and because everything was in the camp. The villagers just kept moving around making noise to keep people out of the houses \u2014 and this turned out to be a problem. And the village itself didn\u2019t even have many trees to stop the dog from barking in. At this point, the village would have been more worried about the dogs barking because there was no one around. But this was all because the village has had some dogs before. So some villagers were concerned that the dogs wouldn\u2019t stop barking as long as they were in town where they couldn\u2019t get away. But as long as the dogs were still in their country home, they wouldn\u2019t have the chance to stop barking.\n\nThe villagers and the village manager said they thought this would be a good chance for the dogs to get away. But when they looked closely to see the toadstools, the locals and villagers were confused. There didn\u2019t seem to be a big reason why the toadstools seemed to be barking too much. It seemed to be some kind of a bug, so if it was to bite the village then it might bite. But there was no reason why the dogs didn\u2019t get around. So why is the town so scared?\n\nThis story will remain a source of anxiety for the villagers. But if any problems were likely to be caused by the local dog, perhaps the villagers would have to learn more about the problem. And it seems that it might actually be a good opportunity for new owners to start dealing with new problems and improve their home life.","token_len":478,"entropy":[7.1029,0.4591,3.915,2.6712,3.6481,6.8832,2.8802,1.4698,3.4195,12.9616,2.7159,6.1227,1.3147,6.8728,8.6203,3.4214,2.8801,9.7926,3.3997,3.1524,0.5864,11.009,3.4357,4.8795,0.0928,0.3783,5.695,1.1784,8.1064,1.5194,1.4147,7.0922,0.5634,6.8623,6.5629,0.8194,0.5453,5.0054,0.8936,0.0671,2.4648,2.2488,0.074,0.0387,0.192,4.0152,2.7407,0.6753,3.4995,0.0015,5.001,1.178,2.5116,5.7728,1.0908,2.0538,4.3506,1.5127,1.8815,0.0756,6.4931,2.345,0.7152,5.8574,1.8713,3.8049,3.9731,4.3452,3.3288,5.4442,0.6829,1.9509,0.6763,2.0956,4.1487,3.8601,3.0258,5.1017,6.8161,4.6206,0.8679,4.4052,4.0019,5.7929,0.5448,4.9802,1.5726,4.9281,7.1614,0.9741,1.301,5.1457,5.2473,0.868,7.2614,4.8818,0.8452,4.3294,0.4777,4.3501,3.7904,2.301,0.8469,6.2603,1.0132,0.527,0.0003,2.1304,4.8934,2.2992,1.5065,1.2751,1.5919,4.7761,6.1225,0.4915,0.0355,4.5284,0.0964,0.1061,4.5413,4.1954,0.4582,5.4433,5.0994,2.5452,6.343,1.2839,2.8662,5.1571,3.397,2.1146,1.0858,6.0071,1.1704,0.3457,3.4865,3.1195,4.6113,0.9435,6.9496,4.8183,1.2842,5.0687,0.2241,0.4444,3.0872,5.2277,3.5945,3.1289,5.4451,2.6012,1.2831,1.5011,2.922,6.4519,7.2342,0.9517,3.2676,1.3318,3.365,6.1511,2.0566,2.4769,5.0684,3.0972,4.367,2.8399,6.8618,1.9643,2.6094,1.6873,3.1497,2.2206,1.3526,0.4368,5.2626,9.2236,2.3947,3.152,6.8407,0.9158,0.0656,0.0349,1.4161,2.7114,0.7019,4.194,2.2406,3.0057,5.2355,3.9512,15.7506,7.0391,1.6312,3.2465,1.2913,5.5183,5.8341,2.3699,4.0834,0.8924,3.987,2.413,0.1665,3.3992,1.0193,5.9501,2.7442,0.4743,0.5546,1.108,2.3458,5.3798,1.4962,1.5143,4.5976,4.004,0.3349,1.1537,0.9161,2.0188,2.6181,2.7322,1.381,0.9808,2.5307,2.4093,1.2448,3.0325,3.4691,1.8827,3.8746,3.1168,1.292,1.8563,4.4911,4.5919,3.793,4.6243,5.0117,0.7998,3.1078,5.8067,1.9589,2.6098,4.0142,1.665,1.148,0.4232,4.078,0.7211,0.1529,0.0396,3.5361,0.7623,4.2182,2.3126,0.0362,0.7726,0.7929,2.1328,4.0736,6.878,0.8538,4.8476,0.1457,0.074,0.0029,2.5328,2.3403,0.7913,2.9876,4.1984,3.8196,0.0086,1.3533,0.6969,0.7747,3.4453,2.0243,3.8803,7.2046,4.6059,0.3898,1.1233,1.8426,0.0637,0.0416,0.0013,2.3615,4.0632,2.3203,0.221,3.5989,1.0199,0.5086,0.6606,0.0002,1.9527,1.971,4.8986,0.9095,2.8341,4.1506,4.3687,1.8935,4.3145,2.461,2.8066,1.2899,0.7806,1.6292,5.8398,1.0737,0.7353,0.9213,0.1575,2.2861,0.5472,0.8352,1.1237,2.3325,1.1865,2.7711,3.3363,5.1621,0.6241,2.6291,2.7278,0.3335,0.0058,0.0559,1.2379,2.0638,6.3754,5.0994,3.774,1.8308,3.1729,0.4595,3.6917,5.8206,0.0351,0.1386,0.0047,0.4892,0.0556,0.0112,2.3125,3.8846,5.4577,1.2149,0.7617,2.925,0.6913,0.0064,0.0111,5.03,0.3215,0.7779,1.3723,5.5377,1.4985,0.432,2.9326,2.5766,2.0929,0.2393,4.5957,1.151,0.0035,4.1069,4.2229,2.2958,2.7625,3.7669,1.6196,0.8739,5.4375,5.5396,1.5773,4.1346,4.2754,1.0405,2.5241,3.3979,4.8801,1.7669,3.4195,0.8825,0.5774,3.656,1.0618,0.8393,0.8853,3.2296,0.1163,0.0262,0.0008,3.2389,6.5545,1.0045,2.5652,5.5194,3.0958,1.6745,4.0358,1.452,0.9107,1.0463,0.5316,0.0001,4.0136,3.783,3.4232,5.6575,3.4749,4.7127,0.3857,6.6957,0.3868,1.246,1.0509,1.803,2.1071,2.6728,4.8989,6.1165,2.7188,7.1187,0.8967,2.4709,3.2912,0.3367,0.5371,7.2485,2.2556,1.1642,5.3993,1.327,1.2329,0.7796,1.4655,3.0654,5.0006,3.6146,0.3754,1.0916,2.5327,0.6779,2.7609,3.6048,2.2091,0.6899,3.6048,2.5961,4.3372,0.4437,1.5394,1.442,4.8354,0.6364,6.2855,3.7599,0.5987,2.7049,6.6594,0.0058,6.6211,2.0564,3.2416,4.2785,0.5432,3.8762,2.094,0.2183]}

I can understand why a lot of companies get to choose not to have the code printed.  It goes against the morals of software, which are really tied to the programming style.\nIt's more than that, it's an outright refusal by the company to have the code printed.    Companies have all kinds of software.  I've seen an industry that *don't* want to work on a product that they don't have to print and it *does* print code.  People are being told that they're better off printing the code.\nNot to mention that people will complain about having to print out the code, because why would they print it at all, they actually use a ton of paper. It's a stupid idea that companies should print stuff like this because it's just something for business.\nI think everyone realizes that those companies printing the code are probably doing so in a way that a company would be printing copies.    Companies are printing copies by the way, and the only way to do this is to print them out on some of the products.\nHow does it compare to printing the code at a convention? If they're printing the code on something else like a desk drawer, why would they?\nI'm not sure what you're asking.  No, I'm just saying that those companies that sell to conventions do something so stupid as to print the code instead of the product.  They still print *the code*, they're just printing it to show what they're printing.\nI thought you meant it was actually printed, and not just printed.

{"id":3167,"ended":false,"length":407,"text":"After hundreds of years of sending messages into the sky, humanity receives its first message from intelligent life. Decoded it simply says, `` Be quiet before they find you. ''\n\nThe first known human-made messages are sent by a species named the Plough, the world\u2019s first contactless computer.\n\nThe first-ever, human-made message messages are sent between four people (a human and a Plough), the scientists say. The message states that the PLOB system is intelligent, and that humans are responsible for creating our planet.\n\n\u201cIf we use Plough, we'll be able to make our planet as hospitable as possible for the future generations,\u201d said team leader Ben Brunt, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nPlough\u2019s first messages were sent back in the 1980s to an environmental scientist named Michael Piazzetta.\n\nHe also worked on the discovery of an alien civilization, and had previously made messages to scientists.\n\nAs a result, Brunt said, the PLOB system is very different from humans.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fascinating that, back in 1980, we didn\u2019t know the human-made message system existed and that we\u2019re still the only scientists who actually heard Plough messages. People were still hearing their own messages, but we can\u2019t speak to how human-made messages are as far as we know right now. That still makes it interesting,\u201d said Brunt.\n\nDespite the differences, the PLOB system is not completely extinct. When the message was first sent to the scientist, it was only discovered in 1977 and was eventually destroyed.

{"id":633,"ended":false,"length":407,"text":"After hundreds of years of sending messages into the sky, humanity receives its first message from intelligent life. Decoded it simply says, `` Be quiet before they find you. ''\n\nThe first known human-made messages are sent by a species named the Plough, the world\u2019s first contactless computer.\n\nThe first-ever, human-made message messages are sent between four people (a human and a Plough), the scientists say. The message states that the PLOB system is intelligent, and that humans are responsible for creating our planet.\n\n\u201cIf we use Plough, we'll be able to make our planet as hospitable as possible for the future generations,\u201d said team leader Ben Brunt, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nPlough\u2019s first messages were sent back in the 1980s to an environmental scientist named Michael Piazzetta.\n\nHe also worked on the discovery of an alien civilization, and had previously made messages to scientists.\n\nAs a result, Brunt said, the PLOB system is very different from humans.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fascinating that, back in 1980, we didn\u2019t know the human-made message system existed and that we\u2019re still the only scientists who actually heard Plough messages. People were still hearing their own messages, but we can\u2019t speak to how human-made messages are as far as we know right now. That still makes it interesting,\u201d said Brunt.\n\nDespite the differences, the PLOB system is not completely extinct. When the message was first sent to the scientist, it was only discovered in 1977 and was eventually destroyed. It didn\u2019t seem to be able to be heard in either day of the week.\n\nScientists now know to listen to the Plough messages. If they choose to listen to them, they can hear the different messages going through the system\u2019s transmission medium.\n\nThis makes Plough\u2019s first communication system completely extinct, Brunt said. But even once it is gone, communication between humans and Plough is still still possible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible,\u201d said Brunt. \u201cBut it\u2019s definitely something we gotta look at for sure.\u201d","token_len":480,"entropy":[9.0921,0.0863,4.7504,0.7782,9.514,3.5903,5.3644,1.0471,4.9899,0.5888,5.9574,10.295,4.0931,1.4215,2.4031,1.4172,7.8854,0.5438,0.8861,8.3936,4.7654,8.248,7.2584,4.9483,1.1124,9.2032,11.8337,4.0084,6.5079,4.4138,4.3109,0.7456,1.4832,4.3309,1.3098,0.0029,2.2284,2.9116,4.4681,3.1023,3.3448,1.1979,4.8079,3.1082,2.098,1.3662,1.9073,5.8165,4.5792,2.2233,6.466,6.4356,4.2371,3.9339,5.2183,14.9981,6.9401,6.1315,0.5312,5.045,7.3746,5.1816,0.3922,1.962,0.0005,1.7138,2.5201,5.3781,0.6119,4.9986,3.6025,0.1812,0.085,0.8391,6.5169,1.3994,0.7296,5.8442,5.257,4.3812,4.2589,3.308,2.6507,1.7691,0.4052,1.7238,0.0037,2.6455,3.7317,4.3445,1.1415,0.2315,1.8311,2.6679,6.2342,1.7552,1.6132,6.0231,4.9539,7.0673,1.0834,5.4132,1.1049,1.2464,1.2724,2.7572,1.0417,3.6578,0.0589,3.6309,4.5939,3.1049,0.579,0.5106,0.0004,4.9873,5.9194,7.6679,2.1865,4.927,3.6126,0.0215,2.284,1.0628,2.9612,1.4193,0.9286,0.0129,3.3913,2.9366,2.6203,4.0147,4.3711,0.0002,0.3254,0.5044,1.6163,2.6472,2.8181,2.5756,1.836,7.277,7.0301,1.8702,6.3368,1.4617,6.5736,5.8346,4.0814,0.9276,0.9021,3.4167,0.3987,0.7632,1.1251,0.008,3.8778,1.1261,0.4215,0.0003,2.4207,0.0277,7.7785,0.5215,4.2235,2.8903,2.8668,1.3452,0.7067,4.2669,0.226,2.514,2.8874,0.0082,3.386,4.4798,7.1411,1.376,1.2338,4.1096,4.5564,5.2724,5.12,4.2409,1.5714,1.6647,0.0003,3.0445,5.5684,4.5698,1.2298,1.3462,4.7302,0.2706,3.6163,2.5842,2.8626,1.6896,2.3532,4.7172,3.9753,4.1868,3.5824,1.3772,2.5601,2.4968,0.61,0.0003,5.5686,1.7904,0.8787,0.5926,2.0179,0.002,2.06,0.4985,1.7079,1.067,0.025,0.4,1.7129,4.7606,2.8517,0.2046,3.0664,1.0481,0.4939,0.0002,2.3616,0.5125,6.6735,2.0977,1.5981,6.6906,1.4905,0.0542,6.034,1.1193,4.2486,5.2327,0.4783,3.7647,0.1253,1.7411,3.2327,0.3892,3.0176,0.1326,1.3279,3.2578,4.3406,1.4597,0.5861,0.9161,1.7447,2.2831,3.9331,1.9449,1.3685,3.3225,0.8115,1.8395,2.5873,5.3796,0.6371,6.6572,1.762,5.5868,3.9871,4.6207,0.0035,3.7324,0.5874,5.8607,2.6346,2.7948,5.4733,4.2794,1.7017,0.9876,1.3469,1.5698,2.2899,5.956,1.804,0.4529,0.0195,5.0391,1.2552,4.4618,5.1264,0.7763,0.0586,0.3608,1.4569,8.0004,4.6347,0.7696,1.0118,1.3684,5.1458,0.0029,0.1832,3.9958,7.0579,2.9891,1.478,2.1954,2.0183,0.7643,1.0674,0.7909,0.2716,0.0008,0.1275,0.1289,0.0003,6.8599,0.9676,4.4112,0.705,1.7931,1.0961,0.0191,0.1812,0.9974,3.3722,3.7184,3.3096,0.6496,6.0692,1.69,5.4316,1.1921,1.306,0.862,2.0443,2.2555,4.3424,0.6382,1.3714,0.7431,2.7915,4.0621,0.7769,4.4774,2.7005,1.9647,4.7067,3.7238,1.1263,3.7759,5.4818,0.4753,0.3358,0.0555,4.4225,0.6311,1.2744,2.7453,0.0018,4.1642,4.5424,2.4499,7.2748,6.7331,3.7021,0.4826,1.4404,1.0081,0.3746,0.0003,4.9796,3.3267,1.3533,6.8757,3.4962,0.6063,1.7081,2.1954,0.0097,2.1727,2.6056,3.9614,1.3307,4.9746,0.255,1.2146,0.7854,1.2398,0.3165,0.4473,1.8515,2.1076,1.3963,6.7956,2.8679,6.0566,2.4508,0.9605,3.3277,7.0437,0.2597,3.9402,5.7592,5.8794,0.5212,0.5065,0.0003,4.2769,4.3141,3.3545,0.0051,2.2263,0.0336,0.1786,2.2417,3.5027,2.7391,5.9276,3.9207,1.2783,0.7634,0.0008,0.197,0.0678,4.7497,4.1565,7.0504,1.3525,2.321,3.1928,0.0584,6.1127,2.0367,0.6031,0.3859,1.097,0.0066,2.3079,0.9646,7.2197,0.37,0.507,0.1955,0.0003,0.702,0.4931,2.7306,1.617,0.0927,0.0146,3.1353,3.5022,2.0968,0.2871,1.3659,0.2866,0.3472,0.0007,0.4813,4.8591,0.3581,1.6303,1.602,0.8651,0.0304,0.0216,5.8842,4.0936,1.4312,8.9434,2.4108,1.3527,4.3345,2.2509,0.4715,2.1776,1.3476]}

The book is written well and as long as you get past the first 2 chapters, you will have plenty to take in.","token_len":481,"entropy":[10.0088,2.6161,0.2173,8.6571,5.1119,6.1886,3.9659,4.8613,4.5608,4.7126,1.9556,1.5438,1.5549,0.3126,1.8994,2.1149,2.2377,0.8458,1.7615,0.136,3.9188,0.7844,5.9782,2.5596,5.183,3.2149,1.7802,4.1126,5.4075,2.8729,1.8619,2.833,2.5447,0.6256,5.9995,1.3475,1.2276,6.0285,2.3998,3.4903,2.611,1.877,1.9271,5.0827,4.7425,3.882,6.3616,0.7087,1.2401,1.4121,1.0698,2.5484,4.8621,3.8095,1.3189,4.1638,5.5172,2.6558,3.4557,5.1102,1.1251,5.3914,2.7213,2.0845,2.6884,5.1121,1.9489,5.2897,3.4394,0.0317,3.4734,0.5997,0.6205,4.1059,1.015,1.0564,3.3976,6.2064,5.9698,0.4864,1.15,1.3177,2.2462,1.5602,2.4922,1.1464,3.5906,2.9279,7.9357,2.8704,4.1411,4.1653,9.988,2.0937,1.185,5.1031,3.9374,0.5942,2.4756,3.9402,1.6994,0.8408,0.5446,1.6784,5.4025,1.7477,4.2941,0.805,4.4341,4.7479,4.0274,2.7216,2.5406,3.2981,5.049,4.4091,1.655,4.6786,0.2033,4.9477,1.5804,2.6269,2.8561,2.0607,2.5609,6.7832,2.3302,0.5702,1.7011,4.2515,2.3239,2.8702,0.421,1.3691,4.2219,1.5988,3.1951,4.0968,0.6588,3.6925,0.6309,1.5248,2.8702,7.0559,1.8456,4.0424,0.7081,1.2896,0.081,5.2023,1.8554,7.4743,1.8882,0.3354,0.8302,0.0002,6.054,3.7518,2.7588,1.7149,5.3458,1.8676,0.0002,4.2786,6.097,0.594,0.1337,0.0604,0.3112,1.5646,5.4919,1.8083,6.0749,5.2386,1.478,2.9422,1.46,2.0795,0.7335,0.4484,0.0035,0.0896,1.0615,5.7165,2.6581,3.1797,0.3905,3.7789,3.7736,0.0521,1.2599,0.2105,1.037,0.5655,0.9003,2.5547,3.1723,2.293,3.2043,6.9429,2.1752,1.3632,2.6665,0.0383,2.7795,0.5438,1.4836,1.602,5.1564,2.6601,3.0359,1.1968,0.7686,2.1554,2.0834,1.004,3.8917,2.4823,4.151,2.1579,3.4163,1.0712,1.9168,6.0809,6.0132,3.6229,3.6818,2.6353,3.3773,8.2847,3.6082,1.062,0.6798,1.2159,1.6823,1.1017,3.9302,4.2483,1.5563,6.0371,3.1002,0.0108,0.6014,3.742,5.1852,0.3498,1.6101,5.5343,0.8918,0.82,0.869,1.2785,2.5537,3.235,1.6025,4.7828,0.7047,0.7408,1.7939,0.0001,2.8347,0.2288,2.1107,0.0598,0.0036,0.1098,0.0001,1.4947,0.3834,0.1966,0.0414,0.0495,0.0714,0.0001,0.7009,0.3297,0.049,0.0137,0.0104,0.0199,0.3003,0.164,0.1388,0.3138,0.1312,0.0323,0.0564,0.1363,0.1553,0.0551,0.0222,0.0013,0.0118,0.1053,0.1203,0.001,0.0017,0.0282,0.5765,0.0281,0.0037,0.0252,0.0095,0.0037,0.0191,0.0022,0.0162,0.0159,0.005,0.0012,0.0003,0.0018,0.0134,0.0021,0.0006,0.0007,0.0019,0.0084,0.0009,0.0018,7.3906,0.0126,0.0032,0.0019,0.0314,0.0213,0.0014,0.0262,4.4872,0.0077,0.0012,0.0064,0.0015,0.0052,0.0022,0.0395,0.0192,0.0027,0.0026,0.0021,0.0023,0.0008,0.0015,0.0012,0.0212,0.0171,0.0011,0.0021,0.0022,0.0014,0.0008,0.0013,0.0004,0.0011,0.0019,0.0005,0.0021,0.0187,0.0345,0.0106,0.0008,0.0015,0.0039,0.001,0.0119,0.0031,0.0044,0.0024,0.0017,0.2531,0.0001,0.5651,0.0038,3.381,0.0103,0.002,0.0662,0.0001,0.2654,3.4393,0.0708,0.0064,0.0373,0.053,0.0001,0.1922,0.1704,0.019,0.0097,0.0042,0.0183,0.0545,0.0266,0.029,0.0616,0.0021,0.0019,0.0135,0.0025,0.011,0.009,0.0102,0.0005,0.0016,0.0072,0.0043,0.0006,0.0006,0.0008,0.038,0.003,0.0015,0.0012,0.002,0.001,0.009,0.0013,0.0127,0.0023,0.0024,0.0012,0.0001,0.0013,0.0051,0.0019,0.0005,0.0003,0.0011,0.0019,0.0011,0.0009,1.2723,0.0062,0.0016,0.0008,0.014,0.0133,0.001,0.0194,0.0695,0.0052,0.0022,0.0059,0.002,0.0054,0.0021,0.0211,0.0045,0.0019,0.0042,0.0011,0.0019,0.0008,0.0019,0.0012,0.0095,0.0036,0.0016,0.0019,0.0024,0.0027,0.0011,0.0018,0.0005,0.0018,0.0023,0.0003,0.0021,0.0039,0.0275,0.016,0.0006,0.0017,0.0031,0.0016,0.0133,0.0018,0.0052,0.002,0.0013]}
{"id":1554,"ended":false,"length":471,"text":"Write a story about this guy... maybe on the news.\n\nTuesday, March 13, 2002\n\nWe all know what happened to the good stuff. My two year old boys kept trying out, trying to win their way into the class of 2002 (yes, I did the math right!). Of all the games they got to play for us, one of them was the one where this guy was a hero.\n\nI'm sure by now you've gotten used to being stuck in a play area as a kid. Sometimes you just want to sit on your bed, pretend to be reading and watch TV and pretend to read as much as you can. Sometimes you just try to be as focused on the good bits that aren't good parts as possible.\n\nThe funny thing about this game is that it's much harder to focus and understand than it is to be able to identify which parts are going to be good. The game shows you what to do, but with this little button you can sort or analyze and learn what you want to and how to do it. (Of course, you still have to know what to do.) Basically, the only goal you get for each part is to be more focused.\n\nThe main points of my blog are:\n\n\"For all of you that struggle with your creative and mathematical abilities,\" said one of the many students I was working with when I wrote this story. \"It helps that we can read the text and decide that we want to get into a game. We didn't need to memorize a mathematical calculation or a formula to do these things\" (emphasis added).\n\nThis game is really powerful and easy to understand, so if you can get it, I recommend it to everyone.\n\n\"This can be achieved by looking at the different colored circles. We can see the movement of the circles in each circle,\" explained one student. \"This helps us be more focused and to do more things so we don't waste time. You can even set up one area as a special feature where you can set specific limits to what you can do. You can also tell which circles you want to focus on, and you can create things for each area.\" (emphasis added).\n\nIf you can get it and understand this game, that's going to be an easy way to improve your creativity and math skills!\"","token_len":481,"entropy":[4.0641,5.7875,2.0279,2.7868,5.4627,4.9045,6.9013,5.2488,2.0429,4.7018,1.4976,1.6747,0.0248,9.067,0.6082,2.5943,3.5366,0.2556,3.92,0.7475,0.0002,5.07,3.698,0.8103,2.7418,1.6806,0.8825,2.1752,6.392,5.6864,1.2978,5.7497,5.7902,4.678,0.0968,6.4571,6.2893,4.4471,6.0355,5.4198,3.4532,0.7695,5.7537,3.0703,2.8049,1.5361,1.3559,5.4678,3.2335,2.2038,4.6391,4.722,0.4669,2.1268,4.4707,3.8521,0.6034,5.1214,3.0271,5.9254,4.7877,0.2109,4.6655,2.265,3.916,1.5343,0.4796,4.3593,2.7668,0.5391,3.3054,1.1769,0.8546,0.6169,2.0711,2.6769,2.511,6.0491,1.6304,2.4579,3.6568,4.6333,0.7452,1.8532,0.0003,2.538,2.7907,1.9532,6.4932,0.5541,0.626,0.9336,5.3182,1.1562,0.0014,4.4274,6.4947,0.7004,1.5059,7.4857,4.2954,5.1394,1.4045,0.801,1.0708,5.5761,0.963,2.2816,2.1673,0.1464,2.964,2.7794,1.8164,3.7052,1.6856,4.9868,1.2389,0.6137,5.1561,3.1532,2.5963,1.9661,1.632,2.6857,1.0268,4.9403,5.0748,1.7299,0.133,0.3223,0.3223,0.7456,3.8758,0.3839,1.3645,5.79,0.4536,2.8959,2.6575,5.8156,1.2131,1.422,5.4698,6.6732,4.6437,3.7905,0.0007,5.1735,6.5899,1.3635,3.1561,0.2649,1.101,0.0002,3.0433,5.0875,0.087,1.2045,1.9473,1.9062,0.262,0.4129,1.4404,1.1241,5.2982,2.2784,0.5667,5.5847,4.1311,4.4969,2.4366,1.864,0.6574,0.2553,2.6127,2.319,0.0029,6.0057,3.8073,1.4919,1.6351,4.5057,0.077,1.3468,1.8632,1.4228,2.6647,3.0053,5.6277,0.7319,2.4314,3.4895,1.2869,1.9826,2.0078,5.1619,3.4354,3.5574,7.5334,1.8062,0.7178,5.8783,7.3077,5.6192,3.3009,4.6435,2.3171,1.666,1.6859,0.4839,7.2718,2.5158,0.7496,0.5827,0.1581,0.2848,5.5296,4.9603,0.0142,0.589,1.6368,3.7121,0.7678,0.1101,3.2124,1.0264,1.3781,0.1489,2.798,7.1904,0.4911,2.2326,3.4018,5.386,2.4843,3.8461,3.9774,3.8526,2.6011,0.6404,0.6644,2.6694,4.0598,1.0392,2.5742,0.6987,0.0002,2.3784,4.9512,5.7694,0.9475,4.3604,5.2358,1.1822,1.8,0.1997,0.0002,5.1071,5.2546,3.8294,1.8468,2.0947,2.9566,6.4209,0.6405,4.0355,7.0645,3.8472,5.6993,1.3833,6.5969,3.8769,3.5123,1.1911,0.9609,5.5286,3.9088,2.629,3.2623,2.8579,0.1087,4.12,0.6293,2.9475,0.3276,4.1154,2.6632,0.2933,2.9696,4.7836,2.9213,4.1959,2.6478,5.7426,2.9565,4.8927,1.3363,5.4287,5.1591,2.1944,1.8773,0.2751,3.8121,2.7161,2.5532,1.9595,2.3202,2.1795,6.0066,0.0008,3.7753,0.5439,5.0108,0.011,3.0824,6.6989,5.6199,1.9532,2.5539,4.6498,1.8788,2.7697,5.7087,0.826,7.2131,2.1024,3.0258,1.161,0.2977,0.5328,0.0002,3.477,3.1023,1.4342,4.0872,5.5482,2.4134,4.7538,0.1869,2.7967,1.9533,2.7676,2.8505,0.1031,3.4429,3.0043,2.53,2.8397,2.2745,2.9715,0.9015,1.4311,2.2217,0.4931,1.117,0.0002,2.6522,3.2577,5.7228,0.5996,6.7961,0.9483,5.0849,0.2665,0.9681,6.0265,5.8063,3.2051,3.1004,3.8092,1.1942,1.4538,1.8352,6.2431,0.4316,0.8207,3.519,2.6387,3.8004,3.2237,4.1026,2.4297,0.8124,1.782,0.4302,0.7828,2.7211,3.1911,0.8371,5.7248,0.9397,2.661,1.5035,3.4728,4.207,1.5364,2.2189,5.7029,0.7292,2.3503,0.0015,3.6215,0.67,3.2996,3.4674,0.7222,2.8918,5.1357,1.0905,5.0852,6.006,4.2637,0.7259,6.2443,5.3845,3.9219,0.4654,0.2752,4.8755,5.2338,6.3496,2.1351,2.1429,0.4294,0.426,0.3152,1.1965,2.5178,0.269,2.6662,5.0593,3.2568,2.7918,1.7502,1.1419,0.1215,2.2472,0.1887,2.2975,1.4755,3.1613,0.0922,4.2592,5.9886,2.8402,2.337,2.5033,2.7706,1.8808,0.3172,0.0207,0.5985,0.0935,0.0002,3.7101,0.1686,2.6433,2.1758,1.5441,3.3884,3.8141,4.1382,0.9408,0.6181,4.8386,0.6403,5.4653,0.0094,0.9435,3.3237,2.2547,1.8264,0.1048,3.5657,0.2844,2.9501,1.2289,2.6127,0.9327,5.6158]}
{"id":1833,"ended":true,"length":457,"text":"Your wife's murderer is the police sketch artist.' - I bet she doesn't like cops.\nIt's a crime here in Canada, not America.\nNope, but she has no moral compass in this shit, so she is obviously mentally ill. But I did get the feeling that this was the sort of thing she might do on the street because she believes she can manipulate cops and she wants to get rich.\nThis is one thing, but this is another. Some people have it all wrong. You said 'I bet her', but then the picture is from another country.\nIt's very different in America because the police presence is minimal.  If your mom wasn't a serial killer in some country and you were a woman, we'd really be a different culture.\nMost certainly we'd be a different culture.  If your mom and that idiot in blue had consensual sex, that would be different.  Most of us would also be very different from that day in the mid 70s where you lived or had relationships.  No, don't take that shit too seriously.\nPeople can tell apart cultures without ever knowing how much worse you are.\nNot a single thing.  It is hard to get past the cultural differences.  It is easy to forget that most Americans actually believe in Jesus.  And there's a lot of other examples of Americans doing similar shit.\n> Not a single thing.  You said \"not a single thing\".  How can you possibly be honest with yourself about a situation where the police presence is minimal? That would hardly be something to forget. It's a fact.\nWell, I was pretty clear in my head that most Americans believe in Jesus so it doesn't surprise me that you found it as hard as I did to put it together.   This isn't anything that I would do lightly.\nWell, it was a joke, just a thought.  There are other issues with the police presence there.  Don't get me wrong.  But the \"not a single thing\" thing is still a little bit of a lie to you, and is still bad enough to warrant a second edit.\nSo, what you're saying is you just believe in Jesus.  Which I fully support, but you didn't say that in a joke, so I don't know which to believe or why.","token_len":482,"entropy":[8.4488,2.944,9.8673,2.1697,3.2738,6.0866,12.3383,4.3956,7.7631,4.6109,5.5277,7.2475,1.8238,3.7205,0.0006,2.6666,4.4936,1.0719,1.8999,9.2533,0.771,2.2564,5.5278,5.5437,1.9425,3.8109,1.3143,3.8608,6.3506,0.6398,1.5305,6.9283,2.3412,0.8881,4.4657,3.3474,3.6866,2.5731,6.5418,1.3392,4.2218,2.0295,7.393,2.4374,2.4126,1.3785,3.5854,6.1355,6.1233,0.5629,0.6894,4.51,2.8898,5.7553,2.9155,2.434,2.6999,0.768,2.6556,1.5956,2.9562,3.3731,0.0014,0.8947,2.3709,3.0505,2.2831,4.1378,2.3123,2.035,5.1083,0.7809,5.972,1.943,2.054,5.8163,4.1822,2.3569,4.1443,3.0492,0.5154,2.4501,5.0286,0.9558,0.9579,3.9894,0.9627,4.4268,3.3701,3.8824,1.2791,2.1375,0.5538,2.437,1.3671,6.5137,1.4587,2.8415,4.1968,2.6476,2.9786,0.798,4.3298,6.5531,4.3716,2.5475,4.8317,3.4805,8.2887,1.4206,3.9504,3.9634,5.633,2.3375,5.3647,4.2864,2.1283,0.8697,1.3647,3.2166,0.6305,4.3798,4.4657,2.5702,2.341,4.3077,2.36,1.2813,8.6512,0.807,5.8619,0.8062,7.9628,11.8055,4.527,5.1113,5.9408,0.0005,3.2275,6.545,0.1302,3.7809,4.6666,3.8239,3.5455,0.8003,1.8766,1.7951,4.9747,1.5149,6.0305,1.3232,6.2915,1.7394,4.1107,3.3673,5.4409,0.36,0.9252,6.341,8.4747,3.6915,1.9452,0.5344,1.155,0.6394,0.6979,0.9378,3.5205,3.2396,2.9613,1.1576,4.2514,6.9428,6.4385,3.0472,6.4691,3.6699,8.3101,0.1226,1.027,3.1631,1.0892,0.4698,4.1984,0.4382,1.5437,6.2592,2.9153,1.0081,0.7563,5.2904,0.4592,3.773,0.3784,3.4484,3.4025,6.4343,1.3557,1.3679,7.0309,3.5018,0.4493,3.7139,2.3064,5.4235,5.662,3.9933,5.7517,1.6752,1.4631,5.5951,1.5925,5.6105,0.0003,3.7829,1.4942,3.2318,3.3688,0.2268,0.3926,1.0932,4.7968,4.0282,4.5613,8.2564,4.1605,6.1234,3.7942,2.3108,2.9264,3.3975,7.5987,4.0299,1.4874,1.3117,1.3994,5.491,3.3916,1.7218,3.9369,4.0198,1.2817,3.1409,3.1936,4.3287,0.3205,3.0702,4.7208,0.9778,5.1084,2.0945,1.2623,0.8633,2.6315,0.98,3.9742,0.1939,4.1064,0.8521,3.8217,3.4231,5.3205,2.674,1.2116,4.8387,2.0579,0.4167,3.03,3.8921,1.9672,1.5253,1.7253,0.199,3.9152,5.8626,0.9205,4.8686,4.1036,5.0823,3.4915,0.8561,0.7393,9.9706,6.777,0.2157,0.0173,0.1391,0.1963,0.9975,5.891,4.1728,3.9498,5.6969,0.0136,0.0037,0.0078,0.5508,0.747,5.4364,2.6969,0.5091,2.834,2.1651,5.9819,0.9327,0.9369,1.5576,4.4333,3.1021,1.5715,3.249,1.023,3.66,0.5415,0.7828,0.4571,5.3002,3.2728,6.9989,0.7348,4.9781,1.5074,7.8977,0.4672,3.6383,1.0452,2.3294,4.5826,1.5556,0.9267,4.824,0.3506,2.0415,3.8573,4.3906,4.083,2.6303,0.7554,5.0358,1.2641,5.1049,1.1331,1.9382,0.4767,0.2148,5.7603,2.5969,3.185,0.0003,2.8509,0.0639,1.3505,3.0099,5.9282,2.6476,6.1969,2.4928,1.1376,1.5474,0.385,2.3266,4.4431,1.2059,2.9321,0.2562,1.339,5.5553,4.7587,3.2585,0.0004,6.0205,2.5572,1.4445,2.6222,3.0716,4.3298,0.7492,1.0878,4.3024,0.2143,2.5403,2.7483,2.0976,5.4073,1.8871,5.3555,2.3368,4.2966,0.8229,0.8496,4.56,1.4703,3.5946,5.2454,2.132,2.0224,2.6713,0.1384,4.9186,1.1119,0.5998,6.4578,0.001,1.5059,0.049,0.0249,1.7917,0.3883,2.4867,2.5676,5.9527,3.6181,0.0365,0.085,0.0403,0.3571,1.8358,1.0071,4.0648,1.5716,3.8789,1.5531,1.089,0.3024,3.9074,3.538,4.1842,2.0865,1.713,4.8131,3.371,6.0535,1.7549,1.4897,3.7763,1.5103,3.8752,11.1122,0.55,0.9163,3.6359,1.5827,3.105,3.3436,1.5435,0.7667,0.3857,3.5619,4.6955,4.3389,1.2344,0.6838,1.4569,0.3769,5.5429,2.7826,6.3159,1.921,1.6272,1.3299,2.0366,4.6031,0.0005,2.4115,1.4367,3.2345,2.6514,4.1095,2.7426,2.1515,1.3828,2.5828,0.0003,1.2717,4.8981,3.3896,1.1523,4.4065,4.0829,0.9208]}

two attempts to cut her wrists she ran away from the gang and \"fought back hard\" before her capture,\" the report said.\nPashtuns admitted to stabbing a neighbour who tried to stop them, but later admitted to stealing a pair of gloves and a shirt from the victim.\nAdvertisement\nOn one occasion, she threw her glove over her head to shield the knife from her stab wound but the other time had her in her arms and a broken wrist as she cut herself to death.\nOn January 3, at 10:30 a.m., the pair went to a house in the village near the village of Morland to pick up an axe that the gang had ordered in preparation for the New Year, which would have been their wedding day.\nShe stabbed the woman to death shortly before 5 a.m., and then took her own life on the same same day.\nA police spokeswoman said: \"We took her home without incident.\n\"Her face and body were covered with blood while she was attacked.\"\nThe victim's family revealed their grief when she left home to attend a party in the village, with her mother and grandmother being among the guests who left after midnight.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nShe was also found with an ax in her purse and a knife in hands at home, both of whom were arrested.\nMurders investigation into the incident\nThe Metropolitan Police said it was the first murder in the gang in the British capital in more than 20 years.\nThe first murder this year was in Manchester when a 26-year-old woman was stabbed in the head by another man.\nThe second, which began with a stabbing in Walthamstow on December 24 last year, took place near

{"id":1964,"ended":true,"length":467,"text":"Write a story that has a completely different meaning when read the second time.\n\nThe book is intended to be used as a form of critique for those who find themselves trying to understand the ideas, techniques, themes of the book. It will be of the same form as the first book (a good book), but I did the writing for the beginning portion and felt the book grew from there. It may seem that there is a need for more content for the middle part of the book because the book isn\u2019t really about anything new, and it isn\u2019t really about the book (i.e. the plot or the themes). It is only a short read as to what I was looking for. The first one is just short and it isn\u2019t really relevant to the whole story. And the second one has more than a decent introduction. I would expect the book to be interesting in that respect. It will also help the reader to understand the theme of the book. It will also help the reader in thinking through what the theme or theme of the book is, and I think that\u2019s what it\u2019s being aimed at.\n\nSo I finished this book. My heart went out to my friends in the Middle East. They are all professionals and they are all working at a small scale. They have all learned nothing from the Book of Genesis and are mostly interested in \u201cdoing\u201d this book. I do hope to use this book as a \u201creal\u201d project to help them in their work (which I have no plans to do right now ). I wish that I could help the middle and high students take the time to review this book. Sometimes you can find it in this web page.\n\nAbout\n\nI am a blogger. If you ever see what can be said about my blog, my writing is quite special and is totally subjective. Not to be too harsh on you, I\u2019m not a blogger.

That being said, they would only be able to destroy them if the ships were damaged.  If the ships were destroyed, they won't get a lot of use.  If not, it would be pretty awesome if they were destroyed, but otherwise wouldn't we need to let a bunch of soldiers go in to do more damage?\nWouldn't the ship be destroyed because of their actions? Or is it that they would have been more easily destroyed by the natives?  Edit: they should have been destroyed in the first place, or had they only wanted to use themselves and their resources in the event of another attack, instead of being a force to contend against.\nHow is this the same thing as destroying your ship in a war? A combat ship would not have been destroyed because it didn't have the chance to save you.\nIt might have saved both of you when they were still in the original battleship, but for only one battle ship, would you have been able to destroy both ships? Which could have forced you into a defensive war against them or were you just going to retreat?\nNot the way I expected it to take place.  Probably more like a first-wave invasion.  Or, if so, it wouldn't have been so devastating to everyone.  I could have put all my troops and resources into my battle ship. I could of destroyed the battleships and got all of the ships back.  But no.\nYou might have lost to a more modern ship, and even if you had no options. So it would have still been a battle ship, though it could've been taken over by the natives.\nWhat about the ships in the new ships?  Are you talking about the battleship or the battleship?

{"id":3716,"ended":true,"length":475,"text":"After a 1000 year slumber, the ancient dragons emerge once more... and find that they really like the modern world.\n\nThe book is a collection of articles written by Richard Branson's father, Daniel Branson, about his business ventures and entrepreneurship. Here are a few of the quotes, from which I can draw my own conclusions:\n\n\"There are hundreds of cities across the world with many cultures and styles. But for a small group of individuals, the real world consists of hundreds of different cultures and styles, but because they are not all related, they all have their own identities. From the old English-born man to the man who built the city that we present here in this book... the only way to really understand them is to be in one part of the world, at a place where we are really not a hundred years out of our past or more than a hundred years or sixty years in the future... in that small world where our common life begins in more than one place, I would say that we are not really a hundred years out of our past or more than a hundred years in the future. But in the old English-born man, he grew up in one part of town where everything is a big city, where people are not really a hundred years out of their past. Then he moved to the city of San Francisco where there is a huge city that contains thousands of different cities... and so many of his friends and family live in many of the other smaller cities. They have to choose between living in the small city or being in the city where they can live freely.... in the small world and the tiny city... in the small world, this is where you find some of the things that made this so many cultures so different, and what makes all of them so different.... I would like to say that the great thing about the book is that although his children are all English now, they were always British. There are still English speakers in America, there are still people in Australia, there are still people who believe it is true as well as there are still people who believe it is true in India and France.\"\n\nBranson would like to add that there are many things that he has discovered that he believes will make it very easy to create an authentic \"real world\" in a short period of time. And there's a whole new world made up of these important things.","token_len":488,"entropy":[3.1393,11.4325,3.2993,9.1838,0.5056,0.9105,1.7195,5.3061,6.3981,6.7472,4.618,0.4713,5.2869,2.4494,5.0874,2.4723,1.3844,5.9975,5.1936,2.5427,7.0282,1.6443,0.7832,1.7637,0.0772,2.5228,5.3122,1.4664,2.1185,3.126,0.0176,5.3617,1.8545,0.2919,5.6212,4.8634,0.1022,2.8508,4.7782,0.7002,6.458,0.8067,0.0018,0.6899,2.5818,1.6082,4.3203,1.5493,1.5066,6.8402,0.7228,5.8459,1.1796,2.1299,0.1668,0.7382,0.8769,5.0369,3.3214,3.0012,4.4635,3.0006,3.1369,4.7917,1.3214,0.322,0.1385,1.1321,0.1173,0.0003,0.7908,3.7057,1.2788,5.1177,0.1807,5.5443,3.402,0.1902,0.3459,2.9013,4.8849,4.5821,1.4283,6.5626,1.8861,3.8886,3.9047,2.9957,3.5973,2.9267,0.1726,4.2587,0.8127,2.0569,5.8453,2.9365,6.2793,0.2038,3.7649,0.3696,2.6988,0.927,0.9495,0.5126,2.1,3.8711,5.9411,1.921,1.391,3.3847,2.9213,4.3133,1.0272,1.3427,2.9178,1.7449,1.8258,0.3119,5.0777,1.1959,5.7899,1.5,5.4595,5.2647,3.408,6.0472,5.4138,0.8588,0.1974,5.3729,1.1137,4.0327,0.9025,4.1079,4.1371,2.9537,8.3866,2.6066,1.8291,2.6182,0.7694,4.4155,1.9421,4.9863,2.444,0.5115,4.7155,0.7971,3.0537,0.4019,0.4334,3.635,2.9202,3.8247,5.3217,0.1472,0.6184,0.1932,1.6473,5.4001,2.0448,2.775,1.1487,3.4104,2.1111,5.3203,3.8813,5.2606,7.3508,2.2597,3.6538,1.7303,2.8855,2.6977,4.5651,5.1038,1.8389,1.3405,1.3874,0.2814,6.7594,8.516,0.5781,2.3419,0.1738,0.128,3.1051,4.2839,3.0754,4.7755,2.9805,2.7376,3.8071,5.8589,4.714,4.6445,3.1719,6.8269,0.6205,0.1571,0.7041,1.1643,4.6123,3.2693,0.7934,1.032,2.4014,0.974,2.8332,3.9871,2.6145,0.9035,0.1707,0.402,0.0531,0.4379,0.1529,1.6752,0.8202,0.0221,0.404,0.2314,0.0583,0.1427,0.0178,0.0487,1.2577,3.4333,2.8705,1.6299,5.1533,2.6385,0.265,0.1887,0.4424,0.9535,3.4062,5.5047,0.327,0.9524,3.5167,1.2631,0.0301,6.0222,2.7914,4.6061,2.3658,3.5966,3.8851,1.8928,1.1115,2.2931,2.5014,1.9017,3.3476,3.0212,3.36,0.8521,0.089,0.4109,0.0165,0.2391,0.1304,1.9388,5.2378,1.0392,3.8885,0.5894,1.8976,2.3279,1.4752,5.3421,0.295,2.3928,3.0984,1.4708,1.2469,2.9434,2.6534,3.0985,5.4011,3.4169,0.12,2.3389,2.4152,3.1531,1.3512,3.7682,4.7909,2.7388,3.3066,2.9761,1.6872,1.2501,2.0512,0.9217,5.6174,2.3438,1.6529,3.6935,5.0803,0.3222,1.8948,3.4426,2.7059,3.422,4.3092,0.8762,3.0276,0.4901,1.7828,3.6177,1.0942,1.607,3.6027,0.8925,0.6388,1.9814,2.2123,1.0167,2.7429,1.6488,5.5992,5.874,3.5673,1.2942,2.755,2.3199,5.1333,1.555,6.2613,2.4407,3.7269,2.236,0.6999,1.833,0.2291,1.5778,5.5685,0.8731,2.0856,2.7288,3.2137,4.8439,1.1665,0.1927,3.5236,0.4789,5.3666,3.7486,5.8484,6.8007,2.9676,2.4448,0.8499,2.1174,1.2257,3.7513,1.4186,3.6722,0.6343,0.9271,0.1174,0.4357,2.7208,3.6068,2.01,3.6898,0.0778,1.7932,0.4863,2.1809,4.3214,3.1493,0.1466,1.4029,0.6962,0.2527,0.3227,7.0967,7.1348,5.9408,1.4663,3.3551,5.7296,7.3191,0.2555,1.1839,3.5459,3.7309,5.7948,1.712,3.9564,1.3393,3.9238,3.8282,3.5794,0.7054,4.2477,1.5885,3.6681,0.2511,0.3471,2.67,1.4275,3.6533,0.7395,0.4493,0.0479,0.0729,0.2799,3.2466,5.7293,4.6946,0.8805,3.8423,6.3626,1.6733,1.0294,3.6769,0.2376,2.2543,0.2775,0.4686,0.9871,0.5358,0.2018,1.2195,1.9377,4.2681,1.713,6.8907,2.9657,0.3283,0.0005,3.4193,0.0008,6.1045,1.7718,0.2806,3.8866,0.8021,3.2222,0.5739,1.8566,3.8238,0.6912,2.7861,2.2785,4.4536,2.0558,1.9165,3.7992,2.8433,1.6333,3.5303,5.5064,1.3542,1.5283,4.0431,2.9747,3.7209,4.4342,3.2174,0.958,0.6891,1.8874,3.1427,3.3641,1.4274,0.0315,0.0085,0.3977,3.9801,3.7588,3.3775,1.5686,3.2826,3.0194,1.8589,7.5787,0.7431,0.056,3.7084,6.4051,2.1127,1.3772]}

{"id":479,"ended":false,"length":481,"text":"From the perspective of an elderly person losing the battle with Alzheimer's as their loved ones come to visit for the last time.'\n\nIt is a common sight to hear stories of a loved one who \"spends the last days of their life on earth\" or that \"the last time she sees the world is tomorrow.\" \"A good year can be defined for those of us who remember the last days we lost on Earth. But for those who cherish the memory and the hope that this last day will be the last day, it is also a new and significant time. That means new friends and new opportunities. And also new connections.\n\nIn our personal story, that time had been lost on Earth... And as we have all been.\n\n\"Every one who has lost a loved one to Alzheimer\u2019s is grieving a loss that they themselves may have not experienced before. Even in the midst of that grieving and that grief, most have lost something that they really would have loved more than death. They must have been touched by that grief, with something that would resonate for them or had something that they have not seen and loved.\"\n\n\"We all love the memory of a loved one. It is one where we all remember the day that we lost our loved one. But as we have all lost a loved one to Alzheimer\u2019s, we must all come back to one that might have left behind such a strong bond of connection and respect.\"\n\n\"There are many of us who are very sad that we lost one who is not only at peace but also in love and support. We all need to come together and remember that we are all the ones responsible for each other. We should all work together on making sure that those who have lost this loved one have a place to live, a place to learn and a place to see others.\"\n\n\"When each of us is going through this grief of loss on Earth, we are all affected by this loss. We are all grieving because we lost someone very special to us. It is not just something that we forget in the same way one may forget on a day where she leaves us. Not only we, but many people are losing one too soon. And it is an important time for us as a family to remember that loss. But it also signifies that we need to come together and remember that we are all the ones responsible for each other.\"","token_len":490,"entropy":[2.4913,4.4212,0.0079,3.3715,5.5746,1.5027,8.6154,3.2933,7.0699,2.8335,2.1617,0.014,6.0721,3.5739,7.0188,0.6661,4.8865,0.8933,4.3027,5.5057,0.5783,3.5652,0.1688,10.8355,0.5186,0.0005,4.2152,1.2856,2.7217,3.6045,4.5267,1.9174,1.4606,4.3866,0.4834,3.3985,3.0573,0.0477,1.866,6.005,4.8679,1.9489,2.5119,1.7305,2.7744,0.6266,0.6142,0.5424,3.0264,6.2799,1.8215,2.7377,5.2281,3.0658,2.2097,1.6559,3.5952,4.2104,5.8605,3.3308,1.356,1.0598,4.7185,1.7301,7.817,3.8219,4.4221,6.4094,3.6157,1.2668,5.8774,6.4715,3.582,3.0871,0.067,0.245,5.1984,1.8384,1.0727,3.1588,7.0516,3.2507,4.712,1.89,2.2699,3.1282,3.1439,0.5249,0.9872,6.3366,1.0501,1.9387,2.8094,1.7351,3.7133,1.9934,3.7536,3.7205,3.9166,0.8627,1.4716,2.4819,0.4775,1.9257,2.8315,1.8339,0.9386,3.9733,1.0857,6.54,2.7596,5.1539,1.479,2.2862,4.2476,4.134,6.0897,3.8154,1.0961,0.6111,3.3213,1.664,2.2328,5.6851,0.9155,5.294,1.8603,3.3725,0.0003,4.2175,3.5022,5.7091,5.2739,0.8387,4.7636,4.3315,5.4578,1.611,2.4196,3.5282,1.2733,6.8417,4.4429,4.5265,1.2506,3.5767,3.9347,2.0164,6.1625,1.2289,0.0002,2.9195,5.5799,4.1306,2.4446,1.5389,1.6867,1.4299,0.2911,0.005,3.4881,0.295,15.3323,6.7043,4.3559,4.9885,3.4623,3.6753,2.6408,1.0871,2.6749,5.6244,2.8074,1.5844,3.3236,1.5814,1.9399,0.6331,5.1531,3.2834,1.1395,2.6836,0.0013,3.6552,3.0238,3.692,5.0197,3.1719,0.2877,6.2789,4.0509,2.8534,2.9255,1.7414,1.0141,5.0636,5.4335,1.1407,1.6939,4.1693,1.4053,7.7922,0.6272,3.3522,4.9699,1.5072,2.3203,3.7474,0.4738,2.3075,5.071,1.8371,5.3564,5.048,0.9001,3.7184,6.2413,3.9457,0.868,4.8618,4.8326,1.6434,1.3419,1.306,4.5141,2.7943,3.3757,3.8268,3.7548,3.6967,0.6658,0.0003,3.3363,2.6526,2.5426,4.4345,2.8085,2.6175,0.5025,2.3087,0.3566,0.054,1.5539,2.5801,0.9384,3.302,7.2971,0.6104,3.6697,2.7724,1.6093,3.9969,1.5813,0.9773,0.6299,2.5789,0.4831,0.5397,0.7812,2.6128,3.5604,0.8518,2.2902,0.0942,6.4011,1.5166,0.0231,0.0012,0.2038,0.0215,0.1753,0.0143,0.003,0.2467,1.1952,1.3778,2.6823,5.1684,3.3057,0.8629,5.2882,3.1339,5.5038,1.1679,5.5188,3.3235,3.1857,0.4436,3.7969,2.8878,2.4392,3.5983,1.0804,4.7816,2.1074,0.2612,0.0002,1.6792,3.6614,1.1578,1.2673,4.4649,0.139,0.3296,2.131,3.9578,3.1954,2.3944,0.987,1.2065,2.7758,4.7305,2.6591,2.3655,3.2198,5.0807,1.7005,1.5483,1.4601,2.6276,2.2427,2.6594,4.448,0.8992,1.5829,1.4572,2.7934,0.5887,2.3516,1.1078,1.0738,2.7404,1.3175,1.7603,1.846,0.7503,3.5714,4.3596,5.37,0.048,5.3629,0.0771,2.338,1.3796,4.5039,1.0761,4.3555,0.4985,4.2924,3.8743,1.482,0.3845,3.2112,1.0844,1.8824,0.138,4.166,1.1998,0.0283,2.7472,1.4271,3.2306,0.8501,1.9774,1.9294,1.301,1.1176,0.1926,4.6337,1.0932,0.6489,0.2549,0.088,5.4406,3.337,1.9312,0.2402,0.0002,0.975,3.7818,6.8953,0.7881,0.0828,2.0736,5.6157,0.0538,2.0903,3.6101,4.5887,0.7619,5.8522,2.4784,0.2736,0.7616,2.2218,0.8783,4.9808,0.682,3.9162,0.5603,0.9133,1.2335,1.6441,0.1619,2.7787,4.0678,0.8758,1.8775,1.3037,6.413,3.3498,3.1002,0.1276,0.749,2.7856,0.489,2.7624,1.8798,5.8356,0.8462,0.895,4.4093,4.6823,1.8296,4.0277,0.2242,6.3176,3.3224,0.8206,4.8864,1.3919,3.3414,5.2547,5.3876,4.7085,1.9717,1.2058,6.5259,0.9452,4.9418,2.9406,0.2097,3.1846,3.6555,2.1818,4.8193,4.3818,3.7239,5.6153,0.8294,3.1412,2.4021,0.4343,4.5359,2.3713,1.1342,1.3581,0.9939,3.5269,2.7797,1.5256,1.0844,1.7416,1.4996,2.9895,1.6688,4.2852,2.0767,2.0074,6.3139,1.0492,0.9218,3.0835,0.1307,2.1325,0.1106,0.988,1.6586,1.0886,1.3367,0.9229,0.2437,1.7845,0.3074,0.6967,0.0794,0.508,0.0317,0.8628]}
{"id":4090,"ended":true,"length":486,"text":"The Coming of Christ has just happened. Yet nobody, especially religious leaders, believe him.\nI don't know, but I have heard stories of a preacher saying something along the lines of, \"we have a good time\" or something along those lines. The problem with me is that it's too personal for people to see. I mean, it's so close to being true, but I can't see much reason to believe it. Why are people so afraid to be honest and open up if they don't believe in Jesus?\nPeople try to make themselves seem as bad as they can so they don't get caught up in the negative connotations that come with it.   Jesus as a savior was not as good as those people you mentioned - there was no good reason to believe in Jesus either. He died to make the world better so more people could live in peace.  He is not that powerful in any way, and most religions do not have any more merit in any other faith but his name is given by God to those who believe in him, or accept him.\nThe Bible isn't written for the purpose of making people feel bad, but it isn't written for the purpose of giving them justification. The Bible says \"we have a good time\" (as an example) and we should all be happy. But the Bible says \"we have nothing more to gain and therefore nothing to lose\". That's like saying I have nothing to lose, only I've got nothing to lose.\nIt was written to make people feel free to go to church and be comfortable. It says \"we have everything in common\" and it says \"what we would have done in a normal conversation\". It states \"I would have done things differently\". Jesus doesn't come to us to prove what we have. If what we had are some things than what we cannot, we cannot be. We must all be like Jesus for the sake of it. He did say that the things that need to be lived out to make us free from sin should be something that we all can do.\nThe Bible doesn't *tell* us to go to churches or to enjoy what we have. It *reads* us to be free from sin, and to be free from whatever shame we may feel. This *is* the Bible, not the church.\nI guess that's true. And there's a difference between the two.","token_len":491,"entropy":[10.7939,1.5541,2.6952,5.9036,4.9795,4.5435,1.0735,6.5775,6.6759,4.2368,4.0596,6.5642,1.6197,0.2901,5.1253,6.1588,0.5634,1.6079,8.6794,3.094,0.0007,1.3564,4.0078,2.3629,0.9885,3.0475,2.1557,3.8839,0.8961,3.9024,4.6616,3.8479,2.9475,2.6882,0.6277,0.0267,0.0556,0.7415,0.2224,6.7778,2.711,2.4625,4.0897,3.5362,4.1514,1.2021,0.8605,1.6282,1.8295,0.0036,0.5814,3.8812,3.2866,1.4269,6.9309,0.6345,0.4155,3.1216,0.9553,4.8467,4.8319,1.7559,3.9496,0.4397,3.576,1.0319,1.725,4.0457,0.177,2.6237,0.3816,3.9331,5.336,0.5803,2.6904,2.3774,1.9228,0.887,1.6466,2.5285,0.2114,2.3294,5.9581,4.1588,0.8065,1.0582,0.8761,0.5682,5.1217,3.7641,1.5801,1.1029,2.5716,1.7612,4.2547,2.9297,2.8424,3.1938,5.7015,5.7953,0.7599,1.7164,0.0007,1.7168,1.973,1.2748,0.5855,0.8512,4.8079,5.5234,0.1937,3.0721,2.7912,2.8428,3.4182,5.7063,0.2087,2.4769,0.4032,4.506,0.9882,1.7967,0.0007,2.7054,2.115,0.5981,0.1056,0.7973,5.5051,4.0639,1.0671,1.995,1.8258,0.3283,2.2224,0.2004,9.0798,8.1053,8.5638,7.007,1.1721,4.5783,2.3775,2.4284,4.7353,1.4001,0.354,4.8784,2.8042,6.9505,3.8753,7.0992,4.2982,1.5689,1.7032,3.063,3.717,0.8267,0.357,1.5144,1.1489,5.8124,0.1982,3.0128,4.2252,2.4285,3.602,2.2005,0.0642,2.1282,4.1438,5.8428,0.2284,1.5291,1.5972,2.1271,0.7343,0.8174,2.094,3.7939,3.6814,2.0459,5.1393,6.9661,3.385,2.5447,0.3936,1.2123,2.9888,5.0411,4.041,3.5935,0.2917,1.8709,3.1785,5.8435,8.1445,1.8853,4.4717,4.3441,7.2019,5.8757,3.9245,3.774,1.8345,4.8176,4.167,1.4205,1.7986,2.1569,0.2334,1.5231,0.6879,0.9119,3.1495,4.2892,6.7171,0.9744,1.4441,1.3349,3.156,3.4213,4.82,0.0004,4.3954,2.4665,2.1625,4.7088,0.0334,2.852,0.8674,2.4132,1.2851,1.9954,0.9269,1.7018,5.1749,0.0003,2.055,1.0535,1.121,0.1286,0.062,3.7587,1.7529,5.766,1.3941,2.5411,0.6616,3.2049,3.6189,4.0157,1.8149,0.8686,0.2194,0.0228,0.8166,4.168,6.0825,5.2818,0.9549,1.7957,0.8755,2.9098,2.9066,3.1099,1.1551,2.0449,1.3514,2.8826,2.4416,0.82,2.0204,1.2114,0.5319,0.6587,4.8103,5.2283,0.3085,3.6192,4.1463,7.3996,3.0545,0.7223,0.2168,2.2923,2.984,0.7728,4.2839,0.2153,4.9257,1.9924,1.5586,0.9241,0.8415,1.8926,4.1473,1.2928,3.3335,0.9225,1.6073,0.6102,2.0139,0.4615,1.7647,3.6336,4.3908,2.9323,1.4281,1.6247,0.715,0.5154,7.1697,0.8328,4.2619,1.6103,1.16,1.5687,2.9228,5.5945,1.3604,1.7713,4.4665,1.152,0.7094,0.23,4.2132,3.054,1.2216,0.7054,1.0316,2.3267,1.1458,0.8369,5.8641,1.2226,5.5564,2.7108,1.51,3.2469,1.99,3.4188,5.9385,2.2988,1.7096,6.2427,1.2004,3.853,2.0061,0.5194,2.2861,2.8812,0.7768,1.7478,5.1945,3.7076,0.0003,5.0388,1.192,3.2851,1.1132,5.4445,3.9646,0.8863,2.4882,2.164,4.7464,6.9246,0.995,4.553,7.3116,4.9528,2.1223,8.3306,1.3594,0.6703,6.9841,3.1843,2.0724,3.3469,1.9259,5.6239,2.5486,2.3436,3.0901,1.2692,4.0138,1.3094,5.1711,2.3571,0.8748,0.0099,3.3936,0.3649,3.6042,4.5127,3.7895,1.2435,3.2759,3.701,1.2601,5.3147,0.1944,0.1971,6.1949,3.4933,4.0127,3.7973,2.2408,4.3764,1.8608,1.6209,5.4175,0.4342,3.9964,0.7766,0.9882,3.1605,2.8857,0.8236,0.9505,1.2419,2.7546,1.3684,2.185,0.0002,10.2679,4.8204,0.2836,1.2333,2.0797,3.1058,0.2928,3.8372,2.3439,1.8087,5.84,4.1098,0.9042,1.2103,0.6159,1.1089,5.8252,8.6026,0.1681,1.7258,1.1635,1.7787,2.4589,0.7755,0.6649,1.8473,1.3828,2.4757,1.5605,1.686,0.2813,4.8932,7.8855,1.0396,1.7427,1.6821,1.0889,3.777,6.3673,2.5776,0.3824,2.2877,2.5255,1.9914,1.3678,1.0607,4.077,0.3249,1.5902,2.3048,4.723,2.4195,0.6934,4.8283,1.1415,4.3271,4.0927,1.1345,1.5549,3.0001,0.2917,2.833,2.2248,0.4223]}
{"id":2425,"ended":true,"length":456,"text":"Write a story from the point of view of a prisoner in solitary confinement.\n\nThe book is intended to help prisoners escape, in a way that they would escape, if they were confined, in other places. It offers an explanation on why prison, once a place of safety, is now now a place of danger.\n\nBy the time the story runs, the prisoners will be sitting around, reading, listening to music, crying and laughing.\n\nIt is a story inspired by and written by Robert Frost, and it begins: \"In solitary, the old house is so secure that it sits comfortably, but the place of death where it has not been used for years is its last home.\"\n\nThe story then takes on other names: \"The old House of the Dead,\" \"Throne of the Dead,\" \"Olive Garden,\" and \"Home for the Dead.\"\n\nThe book is set in Northern Nevada, which lies south of the state line. The inmates include inmates known as \"Old Houseers.\" These inmates were part of a group of inmates known as the \"Honeybadges,\" who were brought to the state in February 1922.\n\nOn one side of the prison, a group of people in blue jeans sit around the campfire.\n\nDuring a brief time before the end of the story, another inmate comes in and introduces himself and writes a long list of words about the Old House.

When the story finishes, the inmate says, \"How could this be in the Bible?\"\n\nThe author then goes back to the camp where the inmates were sent, only for the first few words of the story to be written by the inmate before being sent home.\n\nThe story can be finished in no time, but the prison, once again of danger, remains for the next sentence.\n\nWhen the story begins, the inmates are in prison. The author is at the end of the book and has no further words left.\n\nThe author leaves the prison, says it is time to leave, and the inmates are left alone for the next sentence.\n\nFor more information on Prison Planet California check out Prison Planet.com or at 1-888-310-1122.\n\nThis piece was produced and published by Prison Planet California and is republished with permission.","token_len":491,"entropy":[4.0641,5.7875,3.7279,2.0549,7.5845,0.1553,0.0033,0.0047,1.3549,8.4208,3.3499,3.9954,0.13,1.0831,1.4275,0.0021,2.8689,5.4525,1.8822,4.7986,0.4968,2.4966,1.4488,4.0958,3.58,4.6254,2.0136,0.7681,0.296,3.2787,3.4659,5.1567,2.8341,2.3146,0.5135,1.1522,4.9128,3.4149,2.0816,5.1467,3.5025,0.719,1.7764,4.4801,2.3938,3.8225,6.2765,2.4217,4.2868,5.1129,5.6607,1.7253,2.7093,1.0053,3.1964,0.3796,1.1465,1.736,6.0308,0.8312,0.7508,0.1669,3.0122,0.6049,1.1431,0.0002,5.4474,2.179,1.647,1.6154,3.2484,6.4082,0.7764,1.7259,2.3505,1.0466,1.3261,5.1105,3.315,2.5139,3.5866,1.2101,3.3971,0.6031,1.8298,0.7024,6.9638,1.895,2.3074,0.8489,1.5788,0.0002,2.9184,1.0264,1.7657,2.9239,6.8113,0.0856,5.5865,3.2118,0.5181,5.5923,4.7077,0.781,3.0212,2.4887,4.6437,3.6544,1.2406,2.9079,3.909,1.1006,2.0737,6.9282,5.5878,1.7047,4.9971,7.2737,0.8899,2.3252,6.9075,5.8207,2.6796,2.1164,1.5244,5.6452,3.0791,3.9568,5.4719,1.8811,3.8866,3.8103,0.5832,3.5407,1.0417,2.4317,1.1225,5.5069,4.3967,5.1804,1.4051,0.2834,0.0002,1.5509,2.1441,4.6208,3.447,1.195,6.1195,5.0604,1.8155,1.3661,1.5196,4.648,5.1882,1.0957,1.1817,2.1867,0.7627,0.2828,6.7312,3.4471,0.1528,0.8238,2.2251,0.118,0.2163,5.7461,4.7345,2.2673,0.3173,2.1729,0.4416,5.8478,3.7175,0.3113,0.5939,0.1538,0.3997,0.0002,1.4739,1.9344,1.3821,4.0155,0.4394,6.7259,4.361,0.6737,3.2053,5.3197,4.1095,0.0474,1.3441,2.9263,0.3873,1.1048,1.9197,5.3199,7.7875,4.4631,5.942,0.3478,1.0215,5.3256,2.7196,6.6431,1.4768,3.6753,2.3322,2.6663,5.0304,0.0189,1.4117,1.4347,1.2235,1.9273,2.3741,0.0257,0.4899,0.9982,4.5213,4.8384,4.2522,1.3625,0.952,0.6393,1.2174,4.6301,0.9715,1.0068,2.6459,2.1711,6.6959,5.5119,1.3677,0.6983,0.0002,5.4038,3.876,2.4351,0.4199,0.1102,2.1108,1.6769,2.2653,2.5946,0.0613,3.768,4.5318,4.2303,4.1955,4.4905,2.6264,2.7268,5.477,0.2023,1.3439,2.3619,0.0002,6.4009,2.2969,4.0758,2.9893,4.1015,0.6411,4.2119,0.0572,0.3482,2.0704,0.1081,4.9773,2.6962,4.2908,2.1048,1.2082,5.7002,0.1553,3.464,6.7561,1.7359,5.0802,4.4328,0.0576,3.9191,2.6357,1.405,4.951,0.034,0.7984,2.1357,2.39,5.4081,1.1396,1.308,4.7554,2.1645,4.7749,1.1928,1.679,2.0002,4.7774,3.0658,6.5718,0.7113,1.0421,2.7558,1.5835,2.9335,1.2576,1.6638,4.9257,1.1574,2.1107,3.2421,0.0931,0.8751,2.0865,2.7332,1.1826,0.058,4.7072,3.1543,2.5728,0.8337,5.7299,1.7168,5.4706,0.4958,0.4537,0.0002,1.1358,4.8009,2.2217,2.7375,1.9617,0.5051,0.648,3.6509,4.6987,0.9181,1.7794,1.7662,3.6138,1.5717,6.1542,3.7283,0.753,4.3746,3.9001,1.8707,1.5221,0.2208,0.9774,0.0481,1.3124,2.835,2.3865,1.1778,2.8706,4.7616,3.6695,4.0209,2.9006,0.3131,0.5249,0.0002,1.1508,1.918,5.3344,0.3555,6.0492,1.0161,5.0955,0.7474,1.2811,1.6535,1.7084,3.2245,4.3258,3.5136,2.9547,7.0623,2.2522,0.4124,4.895,5.0763,1.1088,2.5308,6.2858,0.6562,0.5151,0.0002,4.2315,0.6437,1.4377,4.0746,0.2714,0.7826,1.7011,1.1976,3.1505,3.9137,1.9431,1.6526,3.562,3.2722,4.8538,0.5217,3.2756,0.1184,0.6296,2.3763,2.0207,3.6852,4.2913,3.3147,2.4196,3.9585,1.0991,0.524,0.0002,1.4545,2.4494,5.3892,0.7586,1.1647,1.8626,6.0745,4.9495,1.5154,1.5208,0.3805,1.9671,0.983,0.2777,3.286,2.3403,2.2181,3.1256,1.3783,2.8768,1.3175,0.9629,1.21,0.1481,0.4058,0.0002,4.8525,1.8913,0.4234,1.2356,3.6153,5.3485,7.1771,5.6195,0.0259,2.6105,0.4846,1.7163,0.676,3.3953,6.6014,6.5452,0.1171,2.3361,0.0158,5.6165,0.0005,8.4634,2.5754,0.2749,1.023,0.0003,3.3503,4.5578,1.1435,2.7309,3.1541,1.8301,0.2174,0.7969,0.3956,1.0786,2.6249,1.3032,1.9971,0.0281,0.9179,0.1531,0.6183]}

{"id":2130,"ended":false,"length":456,"text":"Robert D. Ballard ( discoverer of the Titanic and Bismarck wrecks among others ) has a little too much to drink and does an AMA on Reddit. When asked what was the most disturbing thing he found on the sea floor, his answer causes widespread panic in the United States. As he points out, if he goes back into the harbor, he would die of his own will and he would probably have an entire family he could leave behind.\n\nIn 2006, I have a book on the Titanic (aka the Lifeboat). I have a movie. And I have a magazine.\n\nI would like to offer an explanation for how the Titanic fell into the sea and how it got to where it did. In 2009, we learned that it only got into the water by the age of 17, that it had two engines and that the two engines made a short cut as to its length. Our first research on the Titanic was based on a chart of the ship\u2019s speed and direction.\n\nAccording to Ballard\u2019s data, the ship fell into the Atlantic in April 1776. It reached its maximum speed around 13.8 knots. She was supposed to come into contact with the ocean in September 1777, or in February 1778, or in June 1782. So she collided on May 5, 1777, about 15 hours before her final voyage.\n\nWe looked for possible signs as well as more than a dozen of their details. We found that the ship sank in the Atlantic at a speed of about 11 knots on a surface that was approximately seven times the size of New York\u2019s Manhattan bridge.\n\nWe would like to suggest to you that at some point that could change (like between a hundred and a thousand years from now). Ballard would not be able to escape the accident and would die.\n\nHow much more can we say about it? It was the biggest disaster in modern U.S. history. And it will cost hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nI believe, my fellow Americans, that if someone had come down here and got into it and died then, it would just be a mess.\n\nWe do not need an AMA about the Titanic. We don\u2019t need one about life on the ocean floor. We need one about the Titanic. We need one about the Titanic.

Not sure a perfect score here, but it would make pretty interesting ideas, especially while using a mix of experimental sounds, including punk, grunge, and metal. But it's also probably more fun to write, because the concept itself might inspire the book to be a little less scary.\n\n2 comments:\n\nThis book is definitely different to my experience because the author isn't afraid of weird things. In fact he has put a lot of science into the book (i.e. the term quantum mechanics). There isn't too much more to the book than that to give people an idea of the different parts of the universe (and how science can help you with a problem). And the music is so fun, that I love it. :)\n\nI had to go in to this one a month before release, due to lack of availability. I've been reading since that day, with a little bit of boredom, or just having fun with the game. I think that the book is pretty good considering the nature of it and the author's abilities. I just enjoy the simplicity, but I wish I could really take more action. I'm not a very successful writer and it would take me lots of writing to write that many books. To this date, I want to write about the nature of religion and the natural world. Maybe I will try writing about that.\n\n2. I really enjoyed reading the book, but a few words of the prose were kind of jarring. I don't think the prose is worth getting into.\n\n3. The author really wanted me to find out how this was coming about, but to my horror I didn't want to. I think I'll put it down.\n\n4. I think that I found the book through the library and got too bogged down in a book that just kept getting thrown in there. Which is sort of an unfortunate thing. The prose was quite original. So it would have been more interesting if the author put it down.\n\n5. The author liked the story enough to write the stories in an old, and somewhat funny, way, just like I had. This book is very similar to the original story except the original characters are back, but a bit more scary.","token_len":493,"entropy":[4.0641,9.2885,13.227,5.8518,2.6113,3.3909,5.1966,4.2904,3.3902,9.2123,0.1586,0.0012,0.3814,9.2209,4.7814,9.8377,2.5395,6.4089,8.1591,0.5592,8.877,5.1528,0.4888,4.3011,1.4512,0.0218,4.4302,5.519,3.8514,2.2977,2.6981,1.9978,2.7151,2.3041,6.0842,3.2307,6.9389,6.3608,5.2042,5.3875,1.1438,0.323,1.5824,2.8291,3.104,7.0503,3.4582,5.6072,3.6171,2.0915,6.3815,3.4831,1.9368,4.5707,0.103,7.4493,4.7083,2.9978,5.2515,7.3036,1.8663,6.9479,0.0267,0.2961,1.4502,3.8006,0.4009,5.5504,2.005,1.4983,3.101,4.5791,3.9718,2.1753,0.5567,1.9876,4.3337,2.2532,2.1337,5.2619,4.1659,3.9554,5.8881,3.6102,4.3771,2.0319,1.573,2.0146,2.1676,2.7523,4.2539,0.8389,0.6273,0.0002,4.9731,10.5759,2.3017,0.9725,0.0002,3.3533,1.6571,0.8507,3.9385,3.9989,4.1751,2.9613,5.4702,6.8669,2.5145,3.7515,5.1629,0.0012,2.1373,1.8732,6.084,2.2873,0.9819,3.8732,0.4839,3.0488,3.1426,5.6811,1.6824,0.3254,0.0803,8.3903,1.7441,1.312,1.4174,3.3468,3.2761,0.0111,0.0003,0.051,2.9208,6.2875,7.2446,0.8907,3.019,4.0595,3.9,0.0004,3.8363,0.1219,5.0136,0.9842,1.8565,2.0867,1.1733,0.9633,5.649,3.964,3.9906,1.7547,0.1032,0.5089,1.8141,5.1259,4.0211,0.435,0.5179,2.7171,2.7286,3.1634,2.8156,6.4706,2.6723,1.7228,2.8517,3.1918,4.2355,2.5302,1.0212,3.8155,1.9595,5.4447,0.8367,4.314,3.9454,2.0589,2.4244,1.6392,4.002,0.783,0.6933,6.0916,0.663,0.0002,2.5274,4.4972,1.9622,3.5463,4.935,2.0294,4.2457,2.8454,4.6423,4.7593,2.2863,4.774,1.8558,4.5888,0.0379,5.0565,0.0145,4.3292,0.7337,1.6252,3.4413,1.6406,3.0889,5.1927,3.65,3.2308,1.1288,4.885,2.1243,3.7956,1.6442,0.1352,5.5728,1.9132,6.2674,2.7443,4.0055,2.0029,2.5339,1.523,4.7422,0.5853,1.621,3.2304,2.8784,2.4637,2.5098,1.0925,3.5602,1.4839,6.2436,1.4084,5.0148,0.0538,2.6778,2.4988,0.8816,5.1587,0.7701,5.9874,0.9135,1.8767,4.459,5.6649,1.5698,6.1535,2.5982,3.0251,1.4746,4.1041,2.0941,1.1109,5.6692,4.5116,3.7233,4.9176,2.1787,2.1885,2.2491,1.7659,2.5498,4.4726,6.1686,1.6634,2.6632,3.2556,2.4259,3.2236,1.9769,6.8617,0.0991,5.147,1.3922,2.7777,3.7125,3.997,2.7381,1.0063,6.4099,4.8109,4.9937,0.7912,0.4871,5.972,0.2871,1.998,3.087,2.2976,5.2951,0.0486,6.7024,1.3341,1.9036,5.9037,0.5886,1.1576,4.8423,1.3169,2.5947,3.1412,3.5404,1.2681,3.9075,2.8555,1.0759,0.0002,3.5742,7.5695,3.2929,3.5052,2.1589,2.2362,1.64,1.5948,1.796,1.6343,5.4924,2.2076,3.7097,3.2251,5.1356,5.7316,2.4506,4.0817,0.1236,5.3586,0.6252,1.3519,3.1091,0.0008,1.4821,2.1703,2.916,1.004,6.4877,5.8366,1.148,1.8281,1.9085,0.0003,2.3533,0.3961,1.7756,2.9585,3.7823,3.5135,2.5187,0.0178,5.0195,1.0202,2.8186,3.8414,3.3006,4.5787,2.4816,1.5029,1.6114,5.1803,2.2198,3.7326,2.0351,1.4531,0.0022,4.6539,0.1227,1.7808,1.3836,2.8899,2.3606,3.4146,5.1477,1.4541,1.9324,3.932,1.1765,0.0002,0.4209,0.0033,1.2927,2.8648,2.7981,2.6048,4.5811,1.1654,1.8425,7.086,1.8971,8.3989,2.669,4.9838,6.203,5.8739,0.0161,0.0024,0.667,4.534,3.9621,2.7319,4.5012,5.1759,1.6523,6.2917,2.6024,2.1194,0.4085,6.3151,1.0695,5.3558,0.0055,4.4796,3.0339,1.2045,1.1412,2.7892,4.231,2.2418,4.1954,5.8932,2.1378,4.6395,2.6421,3.8741,1.0041,0.3482,3.6668,1.7767,0.7921,1.605,0.7292,6.1767,2.5414,1.6857,1.0414,0.7818,0.0002,0.146,0.0026,1.7586,1.5567,5.954,0.9914,3.71,5.8538,0.7347,2.2403,2.5796,6.0854,2.0381,4.2701,5.1124,3.7433,6.0264,4.0637,6.2668,0.866,0.6549,2.0178,5.1246,1.2873,1.5834,4.1414,2.3174,4.4337,2.4177,1.1881,3.2277,4.0419,0.3718,1.4462,2.9849,3.1168,6.1233,2.3241,4.7415,3.3187,0.6751,5.8447,2.4103,2.7007,4.1614,1.7146,0.8772,4.7107,0.5422]}

And as far as we are concerned, they will be faster and more accurate\", says Anushka.\n\nHer latest AI projects include:\n\n\"AI-based artificial-intelligence solutions (such as neural network, deep learning, etc.)\"\n\nShe says the AI is \"really the first major AI development\", while also acknowledging that \"AI is currently being developed worldwide\" so it \"will be the most powerful and influential science\".\n\n\"This can be achieved by creating machine-controlled artificial-intelligence systems... The technology required for making this AI system is now rapidly gaining in scope.\"\n\nTo be more specific, she says there is an imminent technology \"for training and developing in the next generation of artificial intelligence\".\n\n\"A combination of machine learning techniques, artificial intelligence and robotics, could be used as a source of new human intelligence, and to help us find the perfect human-computer interface\", she adds.","token_len":494,"entropy":[5.2847,8.6534,0.3697,5.8806,2.1659,3.0745,1.0205,1.4687,6.3314,4.056,2.6494,4.5027,6.138,8.9339,3.3731,1.5008,2.0776,4.3389,0.718,3.9376,3.9566,1.6186,1.1699,1.5253,1.165,7.7003,7.5248,0.6618,1.1958,2.8552,3.6017,0.749,1.3187,2.3743,3.0807,1.439,0.4371,12.9832,0.6696,0.4847,2.1632,5.0473,8.1846,3.0858,0.8412,0.001,2.3665,1.9878,1.616,2.4739,4.4714,3.6275,0.1556,2.8023,1.6471,3.1875,1.7039,3.9393,4.941,7.2048,1.8563,2.6716,5.1506,6.6212,0.0496,4.9434,3.2086,2.0871,2.2829,3.6875,5.0267,1.5617,0.2021,0.3285,4.8765,0.6179,3.5154,3.102,1.6372,1.2578,0.6332,1.4631,0.0002,4.5336,3.8277,7.75,2.2696,1.0041,1.4426,1.2775,5.6734,6.1045,1.353,3.5096,3.2915,3.3993,1.8072,6.1819,0.2539,1.8702,0.9654,6.8001,5.3563,0.2053,3.5778,4.3019,4.3358,1.7726,3.3605,2.6495,4.1716,0.1027,0.127,4.0828,2.6498,2.2278,0.5246,1.625,0.8791,0.0487,1.6547,1.3001,4.4462,0.0025,2.7217,0.0142,0.0041,1.8389,2.4356,5.6298,2.5611,3.7619,1.3269,1.2727,1.4812,0.7517,0.4164,5.3737,5.2326,1.8465,5.3571,3.373,0.6811,0.1651,0.0002,2.8274,2.1449,4.7314,3.4435,3.3676,6.8803,1.3416,4.4014,5.2771,1.7187,6.7773,0.1714,4.9135,1.4074,4.7519,1.5321,1.9334,1.1878,1.6329,0.0002,2.5041,1.8506,1.9397,5.3613,3.9893,5.4986,2.8763,0.3824,2.1217,0.2177,0.0365,1.5441,3.1018,5.7309,6.6167,1.8169,6.166,2.9667,2.1988,1.2875,0.9833,3.8495,1.8613,1.2774,6.027,5.0165,4.0297,1.2603,6.9846,3.5436,4.5328,6.7986,1.8599,1.9289,1.3684,0.1607,0.6839,3.047,4.9026,2.8565,0.7191,0.7928,0.3145,0.0029,0.0048,0.1893,0.4137,0.0002,2.3279,3.153,2.3142,2.9823,1.0025,2.6899,6.5816,6.6383,1.8235,5.1406,0.8803,0.5867,2.1783,6.2423,2.7758,2.6881,3.5778,4.879,0.0605,2.9534,1.0023,5.2956,1.5066,0.6946,2.5192,1.4973,0.3798,0.4821,1.7815,0.757,0.5009,0.0033,0.0037,0.1402,5.1307,4.474,1.624,1.1796,1.3884,1.8384,5.6563,5.9562,3.7711,1.653,5.064,3.5406,1.9161,4.1775,4.2006,0.7107,0.0353,0.3331,2.9467,2.4837,0.5745,0.0134,0.7855,1.8036,3.0731,1.1752,3.8273,0.4147,0.4092,3.5055,0.7842,0.1316,0.0002,3.2521,4.7459,1.6402,3.2878,0.0181,3.032,0.0299,0.458,1.0699,1.2395,1.441,0.1012,0.0135,4.4047,2.4912,0.9025,0.0121,0.5165,4.4223,1.2381,2.5426,0.5517,8.9889,3.7494,4.5825,4.385,0.0192,2.0515,1.32,0.1001,0.2277,4.82,0.8376,0.6533,4.594,1.1192,0.6584,0.3138,2.484,0.3218,0.1558,0.0041,0.0041,0.1004,0.2659,0.0002,7.2966,4.7542,2.9726,4.2066,1.478,2.4922,0.3953,0.0002,4.2755,3.7175,2.7706,2.2063,4.6992,5.7913,0.059,4.2823,4.858,5.525,0.0021,4.9988,2.4914,2.643,2.9438,0.097,1.006,3.3207,0.5301,4.0083,0.9045,0.0001,6.8548,2.4862,2.5163,1.8038,2.2326,1.9981,4.8399,3.0332,2.5937,4.7018,3.1382,4.2434,3.6747,5.2881,2.797,5.3839,0.5887,1.2623,3.1595,1.3882,4.4353,2.7088,1.6854,6.036,2.8037,4.9534,1.6777,2.3776,1.6505,1.1346,2.6811,2.2433,3.0121,1.6973,4.1384,6.1295,3.4835,0.1892,0.0001,1.8737,3.3938,5.3817,1.0011,2.1986,1.0875,2.8546,4.1066,0.1007,0.1554,3.8344,0.6699,0.0433,1.2602,6.028,3.5264,4.0949,6.3972,1.5766,4.6878,2.6714,4.3023,2.8144,1.1239,4.4548,5.1107,5.0187,2.5679,4.8295,3.1136,0.1352,0.0001,4.8034,3.6762,3.2009,1.7782,0.2206,1.2534,0.3577,4.1958,1.3013,2.7309,5.0559,5.8311,3.3904,3.2004,6.971,1.6683,2.9541,6.6994,1.9444,2.2128,4.0706,0.2,1.892,0.1012,2.7566,0.462,0.0002,1.7574,3.9797,6.0998,0.0187,2.9647,0.5238,4.2273,1.2337,1.8892,0.1062,1.753,4.0905,2.4365,4.0565,1.7033,0.911,3.7389,1.0451,5.546,0.3094,2.2348,4.6116,4.6697,2.1869,1.9026,4.0639,2.6505,2.7636,5.1909,2.6492,4.0613,3.4156,1.063,0.1085,2.0651,1.5283,0.6755,2.404,0.0635]}

Prosecutors say the boy was an aspiring star athlete who tried to compete at football games, using his own money to have sex with and to cheat on his girlfriend and siblings. His cousin, who was playing football at the time where this happened, is accused of molesting the children in February 2004. A federal grand jury declined to indict him because it didn't have the court documents to hold him accountable. But the judge denied bail Thursday and ordered a hearing on his extradition request this weekend -- for now.\n\n( WP ) Teenage boy was arrested on suspicion of molesting three girls in Florida and leaving them alone. Authorities say he threatened to kill himself and one of the victims, and the boy apparently made a sexual statement to friends while in jail for the first time. No charges have been filed against him, and investigators found no evidence to suggest there had been any sexual contact. A criminal complaint against the 17-year-old accused the girl of repeatedly beating him to death, then strangling her with her finger and causing his throat to bleed out. The boy reportedly told police he was afraid to get intimate with one of the girls, who also showed little interest in getting his own money, and the boy reportedly told police he would give it to her and would \u201cdo whatever the hell he wanted.\u201d The case is still active, investigators said at the time, and a trial date hasn't yet been set.","token_len":495,"entropy":[12.9358,5.0822,7.9804,6.5339,9.1115,1.5542,0.5553,0.6275,4.9636,2.4779,3.3689,3.0959,11.2679,3.3969,4.9441,4.2364,9.1902,0.0602,1.5152,1.5748,1.2615,6.9045,3.4016,2.6297,3.4103,2.2866,4.65,0.7784,0.0131,6.3794,3.7048,5.225,0.3076,2.7276,1.0834,0.0016,4.9701,2.1681,4.9773,4.9722,2.897,1.7083,2.3403,6.5718,5.5464,4.7734,3.7613,1.6321,2.0099,2.368,3.7884,1.9303,4.6839,4.5374,0.0008,3.0803,0.8739,4.3419,7.2668,1.5751,5.2885,0.4045,4.5872,1.6523,3.5987,1.5576,6.5382,4.3893,6.7441,6.1843,2.1431,1.6618,3.3607,3.1039,3.1698,2.9759,3.6356,1.9709,3.588,4.0874,2.9529,0.0587,5.2996,2.9302,2.7481,0.0038,3.0095,0.9856,0.2152,0.0289,5.7366,0.6842,1.7976,2.669,2.6092,1.8791,0.991,3.8867,4.4793,2.3317,3.6401,8.3591,2.7752,3.5718,1.9681,0.0356,0.0651,0.0444,0.0354,2.9518,1.162,3.6178,4.2481,2.8972,2.7931,1.7352,5.6262,3.1413,4.04,2.8213,4.136,0.4476,3.1565,3.681,6.4867,0.9983,0.4985,0.5883,0.7825,4.4062,3.0532,1.9445,3.5264,1.8279,1.8403,1.5947,0.2109,0.0707,0.0558,0.0601,1.7586,0.1675,3.2436,0.7306,5.5031,4.9467,1.7669,3.898,5.5971,3.4307,0.3747,0.3011,1.9184,3.7699,1.8506,0.6771,4.9241,1.6532,5.6656,1.214,2.4228,5.3982,3.2167,0.0237,0.2421,8.2514,3.1123,1.973,3.817,4.9963,0.5353,4.1343,5.9441,1.5044,5.6981,4.2313,0.8942,2.5985,3.7399,4.4837,0.0004,5.2503,1.754,0.0478,4.9241,4.2778,6.2749,0.4816,2.2493,5.1011,3.6185,0.6295,4.6266,2.787,6.8477,3.0287,3.9369,4.1291,2.6029,1.4116,4.0333,3.6907,0.0887,3.0536,4.0545,3.8452,0.8277,6.8436,0.8483,1.1128,3.7703,1.5845,4.3823,4.5795,2.5858,5.8636,1.6403,5.085,0.1293,5.9444,2.0131,4.6292,1.7288,2.3533,6.7568,1.2728,3.7773,2.982,0.5442,6.2408,0.8931,0.0851,5.6895,5.1802,5.719,0.4997,0.7526,2.9846,3.2151,5.6648,0.2449,4.2449,5.6306,1.5821,1.4781,1.2398,3.7829,1.4999,1.0407,0.2384,0.0429,8.8544,4.2156,1.4033,0.0962,2.4258,2.2449,0.1032,2.2235,0.0063,1.1328,1.383,3.4091,6.163,4.5877,0.4472,3.6891,3.2951,0.7422,0.0024,2.7438,0.154,0.141,2.1889,3.0685,2.4479,2.3395,0.0007,3.1483,1.6152,8.1044,5.1174,1.0022,6.1024,0.629,0.5748,0.7107,3.1647,1.9227,3.3902,4.748,3.1374,5.3923,2.4358,2.0851,2.5305,2.9751,0.97,1.7384,5.0719,1.864,5.4296,3.5826,5.1369,5.1186,1.53,0.3403,1.5782,0.0003,0.9063,0.2516,0.0172,6.5967,1.1597,2.7059,3.8206,2.5781,2.7633,2.0583,0.0303,2.0953,0.0556,2.7399,1.4394,1.732,2.1177,2.9185,6.6438,1.3545,2.7492,1.8098,3.5588,0.4305,1.547,5.6284,0.6151,0.8573,2.0372,1.9013,4.8048,0.3687,0.7612,3.1358,1.8251,2.3787,3.0212,3.2666,6.2756,4.2559,1.8476,4.4618,4.8638,0.5448,6.3898,4.3272,2.4253,2.1761,5.1678,2.2016,4.1704,0.2017,0.8035,5.8723,0.7044,0.4075,0.0654,0.0837,1.3982,1.2308,1.9163,1.6416,4.4245,5.6026,1.3798,0.5826,2.2861,2.2071,4.6814,3.9728,0.0899,0.4439,2.0481,0.8586,1.0897,3.5127,5.0532,0.5482,2.4477,0.5951,5.0516,0.0185,0.0066,0.0112,0.0013,2.6697,4.9572,3.9732,1.2294,5.2872,5.3736,1.5564,3.4492,0.6345,2.2324,3.2501,3.5897,0.0679,2.8131,1.821,2.5889,6.6934,1.707,5.7429,4.2042,3.1695,0.0368,1.1469,3.4228,0.4332,1.7346,1.9792,4.6697,1.5815,1.6879,0.5316,1.9886,3.3279,1.8845,4.0384,8.78,0.0969,4.7054,0.1353,0.2196,0.7721,1.3599,1.8243,3.7151,6.0547,4.6503,1.3967,0.0798,5.0108,3.8655,2.2894,3.4627,2.1541,1.4067,3.5462,2.1734,3.7431,1.4739,1.4357,0.3798,2.4575,4.6943,3.4719,0.3626,1.9329,3.8371,3.6518,15.5912,7.5674,8.665,1.6025,3.4925,1.4167,0.5992,0.375,1.4432,9.9431,6.526,2.2665,4.4222,1.3657,1.9765,3.688,1.2434,6.1663,1.3049,5.1328,1.0066,0.0966,1.4794,0.7193,3.1206,4.3898,1.799,3.65,0.0008,1.5051,0.021,0.053,0.1426]}

It's hard work.\n\n\"I don't know if it shows people how strong their resume really is in the short term or now.\"\n\nThe women say they're still working hard to get back through the process.\n\nThe pair added, \"I'd like to believe that we'll get there.\"\n\nThe video ends when the male narrator tells the couple that they have three more months to prepare a resume. In which case the duo move on to their new job.","token_len":495,"entropy":[7.6762,5.6774,1.5017,4.2823,0.0136,4.9828,0.534,3.3754,10.2989,0.9025,7.7329,1.8642,3.261,7.36,5.4994,1.202,1.2237,0.0004,2.4154,2.4744,2.0466,1.241,1.3927,3.3243,1.1389,3.0333,3.3406,1.9295,1.1248,4.5684,4.6436,2.3696,2.9923,2.1674,4.5506,5.9646,0.074,3.2472,0.033,2.9804,2.3019,0.0026,0.7157,2.9042,2.1315,2.5276,5.4339,0.5589,3.5102,4.2931,3.8628,4.2335,3.2006,2.3483,3.2841,3.1116,0.012,2.5048,1.8509,4.6902,5.1013,6.1884,5.5491,3.0502,2.5014,6.4989,1.0564,4.2064,0.6432,0.3144,6.2314,3.4125,2.7196,2.039,3.4392,2.863,4.8183,2.9182,2.7942,1.6317,4.0075,4.2835,3.4426,1.093,2.1257,1.2155,5.5548,1.7235,2.5394,3.1893,1.5194,1.5023,3.5717,0.8924,2.3148,5.553,3.439,6.7288,3.2285,0.727,6.2338,0.5282,5.0739,2.7699,2.6715,5.976,2.5327,2.8366,5.2947,3.9853,0.2351,4.7457,0.4665,4.02,1.5986,3.2679,4.3776,0.1905,2.4229,0.3781,0.6009,4.059,3.0966,1.3272,2.3199,0.1084,2.7145,4.2538,2.6964,2.3054,3.9538,1.4086,0.4767,4.1924,6.3721,2.9087,4.1615,1.9947,2.1899,4.9598,1.0555,1.4554,4.029,7.8645,0.3077,2.3322,3.9542,3.4902,1.8013,1.7358,1.6197,2.3439,4.1214,2.3997,3.1139,3.4259,3.3762,1.28,1.1171,1.5741,3.5072,0.4227,0.5209,1.9975,1.798,4.5466,2.3747,2.2181,1.6445,2.1187,3.6287,1.4555,2.472,5.2796,4.9033,1.1678,6.8441,0.0002,4.3295,0.1864,3.0708,4.586,1.107,3.7895,5.5519,1.8731,1.6008,0.4358,0.0002,3.8203,1.2373,1.3154,0.8811,0.0276,1.9845,1.3386,3.1249,0.0003,6.1403,1.1402,2.1128,6.9597,0.7719,1.3387,1.1508,2.5939,2.2301,0.2048,0.4326,1.646,0.1265,4.2222,0.8636,2.5792,0.7092,1.5007,2.1459,0.2179,2.7678,2.3851,0.7837,0.0002,3.6878,2.6117,3.9691,1.9896,2.6279,3.742,4.7985,3.6435,0.9389,2.8864,0.7676,5.3432,1.0139,0.9592,1.8011,2.9585,2.4814,1.4459,2.6406,4.6066,0.1148,4.7634,4.0977,3.247,3.848,3.4315,2.3242,0.393,2.9904,2.2394,1.3366,2.1603,3.5123,0.3217,2.6604,3.6622,1.0992,4.9281,0.9349,1.6795,1.6285,0.748,1.3601,0.4828,3.7695,1.569,1.2009,9.6925,4.0293,5.6189,0.174,0.2586,1.2619,4.511,0.0964,2.3503,3.8844,5.3649,0.3674,6.0598,1.6703,2.5,1.3842,2.2942,0.2318,1.7771,4.6254,3.1751,7.6509,5.2892,4.6232,0.4686,5.2833,5.4594,4.2127,3.3371,3.4139,5.4604,3.8839,0.0028,1.3141,0.4296,0.0002,4.2956,1.6442,1.144,2.596,6.4707,3.0055,3.8972,3.8147,5.6849,5.2973,4.4572,3.1556,2.1067,2.4598,2.0588,3.3406,4.2517,2.0364,5.4025,3.7355,4.5553,4.3668,0.8663,4.1396,0.4771,1.9571,1.6058,5.6999,4.6438,0.8227,0.6804,0.035,0.9586,7.2619,3.6193,1.9726,0.0002,2.2993,6.5555,4.3818,3.9684,1.4973,0.0406,1.1094,3.8418,1.9325,3.0371,3.5116,0.0002,1.7929,0.0748,0.7855,1.484,4.3796,4.3394,5.8003,1.2467,0.3014,1.1384,5.2875,4.9662,0.6472,5.9384,1.6964,3.2972,5.8083,4.4055,1.8109,1.5732,6.5394,6.0733,0.504,0.9193,6.4143,2.0142,2.9411,0.8638,5.2248,5.314,4.39,0.8672,4.4697,2.5565,4.1121,4.2156,4.5063,5.4047,4.1115,1.0388,1.3688,2.115,0.5573,3.2546,2.7555,1.8224,4.0051,0.0002,0.1265,1.2361,3.0249,0.0004,1.3975,0.8707,1.3833,7.5219,4.4953,3.1338,5.3435,2.6264,5.6405,1.6189,0.0386,5.1669,1.5016,4.0985,0.4165,2.0156,7.8691,3.4632,0.3665,0.0002,1.8803,4.1827,3.5945,1.299,3.0194,2.2483,2.7978,2.2684,1.2326,1.0819,1.2114,7.4611,1.0387,2.5929,1.4617,1.6995,0.0002,2.3282,7.3044,4.4026,1.4217,0.0588,1.5125,3.8246,1.1454,0.0983,4.573,0.3402,1.9567,2.2004,1.9661,2.1955,2.171,0.7902,0.0002,2.1647,1.2478,3.2953,4.6875,0.9437,4.178,5.1776,3.4207,0.642,3.8379,0.9735,1.0789,2.3011,4.292,1.5745,2.374,0.5917,3.2613,5.812,1.803,1.1664,4.8782,5.6342,0.5995,1.9082,5.8621,6.1055,0.2175,0.3695,2.4123,3.6237,0.7809,0.8588]}

A zombie apocalypse in which ANIMALS are turning into zombies.\nI don't think I want to go into what he wrote, just that \"The world has turned off.\" It's like he made a post about how he had to leave the world and that it \"was now over.\"\nOh, I did think it had to do with not accepting the fact that we are now, like, literally nothing, but instead, we are somehow less than and\/or less valuable and that it's not really just survival but \"survival only\" - it also happens to be an extreme amount of life.\nIt's about the opposite of survival: a more realistic version.  If not survival, then what do you do?\nYeah, I think that's the issue here. Survival is about *survival* - more than anything else - because we are more human and that is in our nature, both emotionally and otherwise.\nWhat's so special about that?   Do we have a special affinity for survival that can only be seen in movies \/ TV shows, like, every other major TV series and movie\/movies, have?\nWe don't have a special affinity. My grandkids do. I can't imagine myself as an \"average\" person, but I would imagine that they have the same ability to do things that those kids have and therefore do *more*.\nOkay, so I just read the article, and of course I'm interested in that.\nI had to go to school for the last 8 years and I'm the only adult in the school to ever speak of it. I actually believe that's what this quote is saying. They're not trying to keep you away from this, they're just trying to keep you safe.   If we want to talk about survival, I would like to see more documentaries around that area. Like horror films, for example. But it seems like they don't want people to go back to school and to do actual things so people don't die.\nInteresting. So it would be okay if *any* of those things were allowed to happen, but they won't?\nUnfortunately no. The stories in which it would be ok are very rare, just like when movies or documentaries came out, but they weren't allowed to.\nI guess that makes sense. And there's a whole new world out there, after all.","token_len":496,"entropy":[11.0999,1.2711,2.6438,2.1255,3.3999,3.4931,8.7709,2.9305,3.8467,1.8563,11.7263,2.3714,1.2866,2.2337,7.4194,1.6414,1.3327,1.1281,1.6624,7.6329,3.185,0.0008,1.9179,1.6412,4.7047,0.2241,3.1944,0.6834,4.0978,5.2536,4.6257,1.3426,4.779,2.8902,6.4178,3.4857,4.8064,3.0206,3.3185,5.8223,2.8998,2.6203,0.7429,3.6357,2.6702,4.4363,1.0848,5.7386,1.6433,2.6069,2.2924,3.4068,1.97,4.4533,1.5575,2.9494,1.9785,4.0598,2.7448,5.5404,2.4725,7.2911,3.9645,0.7529,1.8729,5.6195,0.6274,2.6804,4.6966,4.1778,2.211,4.0064,0.7714,2.2169,0.0072,6.4197,6.3057,1.302,1.62,0.0668,3.0484,1.9776,3.2064,4.7098,3.4892,0.2341,4.2609,6.4531,2.3585,2.4572,5.7999,2.3504,2.4085,1.2173,4.9208,5.1817,1.7512,5.655,6.2584,0.0017,2.1372,5.284,3.0946,3.2,3.1482,1.0742,3.1369,3.0551,5.174,6.9011,4.1236,4.7844,3.0641,0.055,5.5947,1.1799,5.4053,2.9426,5.8383,5.9045,0.5947,0.3104,3.7622,4.9967,5.2431,0.1462,5.6882,1.3487,1.0528,3.3328,0.6813,4.3971,2.1695,6.8404,0.1189,2.627,3.5303,4.0752,5.2945,3.7623,2.1362,3.6515,6.6468,11.2472,5.5705,1.6521,0.4621,0.428,3.1792,4.5592,0.8929,2.1424,1.0537,1.0087,3.3679,0.2296,1.0536,1.9733,1.8675,1.2191,2.352,4.7428,3.2265,0.438,6.0328,0.7191,2.1366,8.8353,3.4615,0.024,1.6298,1.9594,5.842,1.6428,2.6692,0.4675,3.1908,3.5399,2.3054,1.5569,4.4511,3.6067,2.3374,3.8831,2.7072,5.6241,3.0005,1.5593,2.1881,7.3606,5.1843,0.0787,5.8279,0.2519,1.6316,3.5901,2.4048,3.8723,3.2297,0.0681,3.045,1.0076,3.0969,4.0318,6.6849,1.9019,1.9766,2.0629,4.7922,5.5827,0.4176,1.5867,3.3784,4.2916,2.323,0.2573,4.105,1.0159,3.4535,8.3949,1.2239,1.0083,2.8921,4.1836,3.7953,6.4401,2.1125,5.0095,4.1306,2.1276,3.6564,2.7999,4.0317,5.2773,0.0097,2.3169,7.0061,4.147,1.0411,3.8264,2.5871,0.0005,1.1515,1.3792,0.4195,0.1366,2.7783,6.4727,6.1474,2.6557,3.721,0.9313,1.8484,4.0649,0.7276,2.4199,5.2913,3.255,2.0571,3.9602,3.4797,0.4354,0.9878,1.5341,1.1257,0.88,4.0311,2.5548,0.9043,2.5867,2.4683,3.2254,0.4167,4.7558,0.6592,3.5157,1.9165,1.2902,6.5835,3.3351,2.2512,3.5925,6.6424,4.4843,6.7344,3.1283,3.9116,1.3912,5.1935,0.2831,0.956,2.3138,4.7184,4.0172,2.5632,3.6043,1.9918,1.2174,6.8612,0.0674,1.1367,1.6573,5.2981,0.6545,2.6326,0.8405,1.8779,1.8624,4.6777,2.0882,2.7848,2.0875,3.7942,2.824,3.2469,3.2886,4.6529,0.5187,2.1345,1.5864,2.4909,5.1386,0.9321,3.9396,1.0647,1.4038,2.3466,4.5634,4.5618,4.747,3.3101,1.5434,0.665,1.784,5.0002,5.1894,0.7137,4.5289,2.5543,4.121,5.8806,0.9469,3.3542,0.7704,6.1139,1.9654,2.8501,3.9134,0.0146,6.7346,1.8059,3.5137,0.332,2.8564,2.171,1.4702,0.2639,1.4598,1.1417,0.0157,1.7968,0.3014,4.8316,0.7434,2.609,2.7618,4.2067,3.6016,3.2639,0.2737,3.9038,0.1289,1.9868,0.8334,2.6686,3.0524,2.4586,0.1479,2.6423,3.0485,6.5332,5.7335,2.3159,4.5158,0.9706,5.4019,6.7521,1.3625,1.1309,4.3484,0.4387,0.6688,4.0868,3.3774,3.1779,0.574,2.7779,2.4349,0.0004,1.5458,3.4342,0.5436,2.8857,3.6029,0.9452,1.9595,1.6197,3.998,3.0834,6.3715,3.4514,5.6101,3.4475,1.4823,0.0004,4.0886,1.1378,1.0665,7.3981,0.0266,0.9289,3.3532,3.7445,3.5563,1.0073,5.5054,0.5218,8.2282,3.9353,0.6954,1.4045,1.8974,2.6015,1.6376,3.847,0.7948,0.7913,1.4348,0.8554,3.3566,4.4018,0.0006,1.9901,1.0809,7.2441,4.6144,0.5915,3.2371,6.5104,3.0224,5.6753,3.5298,3.1529,0.4893,2.2963,3.9319,3.7881,3.5662,1.5819,5.1427,1.3623,4.0132,6.3816,3.1745,5.0492,4.9466,0.2438,2.1256,1.9843,1.8097,3.6903,0.0003,0.7038,0.5277,1.8298,1.9051,2.0995,3.1896,1.8872,3.1995,0.7335,0.8862,4.4982,4.0342,1.0093,1.3926,3.5031,3.5782,2.9828,1.6994,0.0121,1.7331,5.7195,0.0791,0.3937]}

{"id":4684,"ended":true,"length":485,"text":"Your past, present, and future selves are gathered together in a room, but they don't seem to recognize one another. How does the day unfold?\nI don't know, but I have an idea. Maybe a little bit of each, and then slowly we get together and focus on where we are going in time. Then once we're out of \"the moment\" (i.e. \"the moment\" is the point we're all aware), we are free and free to communicate and be ourselves.\nWhat happens if that happens and you don't tell them that you're feeling lonely? That means you won't be as open to them as you had before (i.e. the other person had to be there because everything else in your life was going as they expected).   Or you can move out and stay with a friend whom you've really gotten a good grounding on.\nIt would also be nice to be able to connect more with them because I can do that, though I think there would definitely be more than one.  I would be very interested in doing that with a girlfriend. She could be a good first step if possible, but I don't feel like sharing her experiences with the other girl could help me to make that first step. I'm not a big personality person and I'm certainly not going to be an anchor.\nIf you're really interested you can try to use another friend to bring those out. If both of you want to go hang out with other girls this could be really sweet of you. If she can help you to make the first step, that could be a really cool thing.  Edit: I forgot to say my boyfriend is a huge dick. If you can talk to him in person maybe he could be able to help me find a way to connect with her. I don't know what kind of relationship we would be but I think he could be a good help, but there is a lot of potential for abuse.\nI am sure it would be great to be able to connect more with other girls.

{"id":2275,"ended":true,"length":473,"text":"`` Do not go to sleep. ''\n\n'' Do not go to sleep. ''\n\nThe problem I've got is that the '''nightmare''' is a complete lie. There are quite a few stories from the '99s that were told to me on Sunday night (not the day the kids were born) and I believe some of it was just ''' lying around the house and not really being honest''.\n\nI've also got this problem with sleep: it's often hard for me to put a stop to it so I turn off the light and use the power switch to switch back on and everything else is fine as usual. Now to turn it back on I need to move out of the room to find an extra space to put a pillow top on the sides of the room, but I don't know whether that is practical because I can't sleep in both of those rooms right now due to their closeness. I've been told to try to do the opposite and put my own pillow or bedding up on the second floor and I've found that it works for me, but unfortunately it isn't always possible; I just need to try the next one.\n\nIf you need more space (there are 2) just keep going and it will take you out.\n\nOne of my friends (a great friend) told me to go to bed when I was working, but I only went to bed when she was asleep. She was the only one I knew who always slept in between meals, and the only one I could find who would often wake up by the sound of her getting up.\n\nI've been told to try the next one too and this made me so nervous. My sister's sister is a nurse. If I ever had one of those night-time panic attacks my life would be complete. My only advice would be to call your insurance now, because I know that there are plans for the best solution to your sleep problem.\n\nI hope you have a great night tonight. I know this will be a challenge because most of us are so far behind, and often fall behind. However, I wish you both luck and best of luck as you find your way back to reality.\n\nIf you can spare a few minutes and call your insurance, that could probably be the best solution for you. That would obviously save you both a lot of money and it would probably help you sleep more comfortable.","token_len":498,"entropy":[9.1342,1.3895,5.0858,1.7691,2.9834,1.5688,7.9355,2.0059,0.0148,3.0067,2.7916,0.0297,1.2331,0.1012,0.028,0.1984,0.5973,1.2572,0.0002,5.4163,5.794,5.3105,2.7031,2.6576,0.8691,0.689,2.5505,5.2122,6.0918,10.2618,1.0115,2.5002,5.5434,1.7331,2.2303,5.1043,2.2056,0.4391,3.4277,1.465,6.3048,0.0882,0.2074,5.1547,4.1332,1.6406,2.7042,7.1013,3.0628,1.5927,3.8366,3.2541,1.8278,1.467,4.4829,6.8632,2.4731,3.932,4.4725,2.952,3.4896,3.703,5.3839,1.243,0.9271,1.6294,1.4363,2.2217,4.5493,4.0754,0.2876,4.1155,0.9116,3.9369,4.3102,2.693,11.6435,2.6428,2.2741,0.8557,3.7796,2.1866,2.083,2.67,6.3039,7.8552,1.2561,0.0005,2.0043,2.3205,3.1532,2.5555,3.0396,3.7038,1.2387,6.3028,2.9933,3.0437,0.857,4.2216,3.1689,2.2308,0.8894,0.0641,4.2388,3.0081,2.9055,0.0743,0.5476,5.1349,0.6179,5.2924,1.4387,0.623,3.3685,1.493,5.4592,1.0448,4.8125,4.877,1.8187,4.3386,3.5219,0.4345,3.5175,6.9259,2.0839,1.6529,2.0653,5.0547,1.3026,0.2637,6.0389,5.1561,5.8227,2.3589,2.0983,0.1551,1.937,1.7205,0.2324,5.6094,3.9562,0.4588,0.5053,1.8903,3.2005,3.0261,3.6002,3.4528,5.0424,2.5071,1.9822,2.2161,3.5745,5.3236,1.1179,2.0988,8.2435,0.5863,0.4162,1.5526,2.4388,3.4585,1.6579,2.4127,0.001,1.9814,4.116,1.8286,2.5106,5.9704,4.1993,1.0726,2.7387,0.334,3.7829,2.1212,8.0083,2.8777,1.5119,1.6921,4.3082,0.0359,5.8394,0.0139,5.0439,3.8091,0.7636,1.3524,1.9522,2.4439,2.6301,3.1088,2.0653,4.8185,1.4305,4.284,2.3489,3.5854,1.7138,4.2934,2.4615,3.4899,0.8683,5.1032,3.6265,3.3588,3.777,1.7198,0.5369,5.4097,0.0974,2.3108,2.3985,1.6564,2.8285,0.8546,1.5937,2.6297,4.0806,0.2988,2.1779,0.6224,5.7811,1.7103,3.703,0.001,3.1367,2.1966,6.2778,1.5643,4.0654,2.2714,0.3408,3.6853,4.0732,3.7061,2.9835,0.9798,0.7252,0.0002,3.666,0.969,4.3448,2.8648,4.4325,4.2847,5.7305,0.6995,5.243,3.0289,4.1767,4.5002,1.6501,2.0299,3.7618,0.6907,2.948,0.8171,4.5817,2.2771,1.3451,0.0003,5.0854,1.6379,1.792,2.4272,3.5945,2.5879,5.5956,2.708,1.3542,2.1417,0.0506,2.8824,2.4336,1.0489,1.4235,4.2978,0.8284,0.8322,6.5714,2.6241,1.4432,1.1064,5.1041,2.4981,0.7062,0.5926,0.9535,2.6054,0.4035,1.8656,0.8794,2.3791,2.5837,4.5243,1.0216,0.4104,2.2781,2.0487,1.3044,5.0225,2.2408,1.5717,4.8336,5.6659,1.7769,1.6347,3.8022,1.0575,0.277,1.3566,2.0538,2.2165,0.6884,1.7369,5.3991,2.5895,0.6334,5.584,1.9056,4.4251,0.031,1.3951,5.7698,0.1681,1.4816,1.694,0.0002,1.6077,1.7965,2.2097,0.6118,1.3362,3.617,2.6639,1.1016,0.5618,4.6186,2.0316,4.157,6.6088,0.9989,3.9994,4.5947,2.2316,4.118,4.7246,3.6848,3.2075,2.5295,1.3311,2.8915,2.8968,3.8888,1.1062,3.9803,3.2101,4.5538,0.8747,0.5,4.8489,2.8701,0.6773,4.3616,0.0663,5.2192,4.5802,0.164,1.0298,5.4436,1.7019,3.8591,4.8018,3.1424,1.1259,0.0461,0.3329,5.2191,2.3997,5.2816,6.3962,1.854,2.1761,2.0641,2.5426,1.4439,3.541,0.8947,5.8874,2.0012,3.6723,4.7727,5.703,1.6979,2.9682,3.6214,1.3226,0.7168,0.6204,0.0003,1.9118,4.2509,1.2706,2.3479,1.3916,1.5852,1.4156,5.6286,1.2378,2.2667,2.82,3.5883,3.1473,0.9306,1.205,3.9743,4.0418,5.035,0.5747,1.9433,1.8825,3.3652,4.6784,2.1349,2.674,1.7752,6.354,5.3511,1.3654,2.6017,4.0172,0.4533,1.0927,5.3548,2.5794,5.8401,2.3655,1.3845,5.2333,0.7299,0.0011,3.5287,0.6383,3.6113,2.0249,1.2047,1.6727,0.6422,5.7162,0.5794,0.7498,0.0003,3.4496,0.1607,4.087,4.4743,1.0447,1.9884,1.0514,2.0929,5.879,1.2844,0.7424,2.7518,4.4662,3.6893,5.9043,1.7606,1.1413,1.2357,1.6853,1.8198,0.2935,0.4167,5.5551,2.5448,6.8923,2.8592,0.649,6.5828,1.831,0.4757,0.0291,1.0007,1.2236,3.8859,0.5421,2.6511,2.3362,0.5371,3.076,3.0612,6.4622,1.198]}
{"id":4418,"ended":true,"length":474,"text":"After dying, you are born again with all of your knowledge. When you grow up you are labeled crazy and put in a mental institution.\nI don't think I'm necessarily crazy. I've been a doctor who has worked, studied, lectured, and spoken to a large number of people in my lifetime, so having knowledge can be quite useful. I did teach myself medicine and did my doctorate so it's not a hard science to share. And I'm young, and people in my 20's will be more into this topic, if they want.\nYou arent insane, but youre not learning as fast.  Your question is if you had all of your knowledge that your brain will develop and it will be more useful as you grow older to help people.  Or you were just going to be a fucking retard until you were old enough to understand why people get cancer when we are ill.\nWhat do you mean is if you had knowledge of all that you have learned that there would have been more cancer in your brain?   Do you have a specific example in mind where you think I should have learned that I have all of my knowledge that my brain would develop and become the most useful as I grow older and that I can help others. My question is whether you learned as fast as I did.\nI would not suggest you learn how to use science, although this can teach you things about the stuff being taught in medicine right now.\nOkay I gotcha... But could you also explain what I need to do to become a better doctor?\nYou probably needed to change your attitude (or at least the way you were acting) to get into a doctorate. If you didn't change your attitude you wouldn't be a doctor.\nIt's too bad this isn't so funny. My doctor's degree is from MIT. If I ever had the chance to pursue a doctorate, my focus would be on research of medicine.\nWell the best doctors don't become doctors, it takes a lot less effort.  If any doctor is a doctor, it is something people do all in the same.  You are trying *for* a doctorate, it is not what you wanted.\nYes, but I would like it if I were given a chance to pursue a doctorate.

{"id":4780,"ended":true,"length":464,"text":"You were born into a nomadic tribe. When you decide to stay behind, you discover who\/what you \u2019 ve been running from all this time.\nI don't know, it's funny. I've been a nomad for years, and I have spent hours traveling and researching a lot of different tribes in Africa. But I've recently begun making \"factions\" (i.e. tribes) and my life is starting to change dramatically. I've been working with different tribes, and people from different countries, and my tribe is different today, but I finally decided to focus on one of them. My tribal has only two languages. One is French and the other is Urdu.\n\nBut there are also certain words. In one country, \"Fountain\" is pronounced \"frit\" in other words \"Swan\", \"Jaw-Frit\", \"Jah\", \"Jaw-Frit\" in many different ways.\n\nIf you can do that, you will be able to do all kinds of things. But I would suggest that you do not do the \"faction\" part, or at first only \"faction\" and \"faction\". At first you can tell, as you go to the jungle. But eventually the only thing you will do is \"faction\" more than once. When you enter the jungle you will see a lot of strange objects. Like a cat sitting on a beach and its body is shaped like a snake. Then there are strange items like a bird of prey. But when you return to the jungle you will also see that unusual animals (like sheep) are found everywhere. And the jungle is very weird. Because it has the sound of snow and the smell of fresh fish. They also smell of snow everywhere. And you can smell many things like \"fog\", \"smog\", \"blob\", \"smoky\", \"scenewa\" (the sound of snow dripping from the nose) and \"wett\" (the smell of snow dripping from the nose).\n\nAnd you can see so many different ways to get \"faction\" \"faction\" as they appear. It is not enough for many things to show up. You can also watch the jungle animals in the same way that you can see many different things in the sky.\n\nAt least I got to work on myself at the start, and I look forward to a lot of it.","token_len":499,"entropy":[5.3684,3.8334,3.0889,0.8896,7.616,0.0426,2.2262,2.0122,4.0153,1.041,6.9031,0.1975,3.8892,5.5612,1.0427,0.6306,6.7744,6.9899,8.6249,0.252,0.4681,16.7646,7.9116,14.1348,1.6472,7.529,2.0184,3.3576,2.4125,0.071,0.5271,2.4021,7.7887,3.5561,0.018,1.1105,3.177,2.789,0.7503,4.4942,1.095,1.6035,2.6313,1.2176,3.7511,1.515,0.5215,0.4804,3.6843,1.2085,1.1894,1.0077,3.1628,4.9118,4.1615,5.3442,3.1026,4.9627,4.9691,1.5198,0.4314,1.7522,2.4344,3.0314,4.0607,1.0043,2.9867,1.3276,1.8223,6.1823,4.7924,5.2498,6.7637,5.4795,4.9322,0.3546,3.5564,3.5692,0.0075,0.0005,0.9123,3.4634,2.8624,2.5548,4.813,4.1478,2.1543,3.2749,0.0274,1.5636,4.6692,0.3078,1.3043,1.6394,1.9987,3.355,2.0901,3.7886,1.7339,1.7467,1.5991,4.9275,2.3872,0.8863,2.6252,1.013,0.8217,4.4915,2.8956,0.9801,5.5895,6.9879,3.049,1.3229,0.9157,6.9731,2.8675,0.3754,4.6683,0.205,4.2374,2.6073,2.8512,1.0209,3.8329,5.1047,4.7206,5.631,3.3442,6.0563,2.2261,3.673,0.5506,2.8997,1.7066,0.5267,0.0216,0.3618,5.261,0.0151,0.2705,1.8005,6.8022,5.0552,3.7796,1.2579,3.4408,4.9966,4.1482,4.3847,3.7733,4.3376,5.8512,0.501,4.1043,3.382,6.2507,1.0464,1.0168,2.9006,1.6163,2.1107,6.7864,1.8407,1.55,5.0915,2.0956,3.1204,6.2159,5.3777,3.3412,1.2839,5.077,4.4257,5.8386,4.5534,1.1206,0.8674,0.7992,3.3266,4.5802,2.9078,0.6105,2.447,2.4861,0.5983,1.3047,0.0971,2.0102,2.6542,4.1604,3.241,2.638,0.4158,2.2569,0.0002,4.5206,0.4868,3.7891,5.0285,1.6494,0.4068,1.0767,2.0973,1.3955,1.1613,0.0059,3.479,4.132,2.1328,0.0035,0.5852,1.0425,3.4692,2.0863,3.9238,3.0502,1.2561,0.5131,2.5116,1.7446,3.1144,3.6233,1.8191,1.475,1.6441,0.4097,2.5288,2.5084,3.4441,2.8506,7.6969,5.4379,2.8613,0.8192,1.0903,0.7285,3.2037,1.9008,1.2378,0.7673,2.5352,5.0474,1.7319,1.4215,3.6181,4.9986,4.2738,4.8478,1.3492,2.5849,4.367,1.8084,6.5218,3.27,1.3777,2.9157,3.6114,4.6105,1.1187,0.4649,1.3567,3.5049,0.2016,2.6603,1.3882,0.2425,0.7088,5.7174,2.0428,2.0344,0.5887,4.4214,0.3866,5.3979,0.7957,0.6263,1.8808,0.5382,1.6904,1.9629,3.0333,0.1785,4.3064,4.8134,1.4205,5.2222,2.2074,6.0753,5.1413,0.6308,0.5856,4.3502,3.5597,4.3625,3.7363,1.9325,5.8276,0.0897,0.2913,3.7191,0.4355,3.1372,3.0581,0.9972,3.5175,4.9704,1.7798,1.8899,4.4395,5.1109,0.1152,1.5999,3.5228,2.7965,0.1322,4.7653,0.6652,0.4917,0.5085,0.8317,0.2147,3.8414,0.5627,2.8998,8.3253,4.0521,4.7685,1.065,5.5631,0.9014,0.9749,5.1108,3.5674,0.3706,2.6127,3.192,4.9149,0.8045,3.1641,4.3926,0.5014,5.5487,2.5283,2.5941,3.9068,5.6973,0.1044,7.4272,2.0695,1.9254,1.652,0.0151,5.6544,4.406,0.522,5.4609,3.675,3.8344,2.7249,4.3708,4.7376,0.3866,1.918,2.8759,1.7008,2.6331,5.9083,1.1978,3.1228,3.8537,2.9305,3.6291,1.6422,0.4368,4.6632,2.4385,0.2375,0.6936,6.5865,5.552,0.3905,0.5396,3.8806,6.2016,1.1505,0.407,5.002,6.4237,8.4864,4.1906,3.0153,2.7021,3.0263,3.1217,0.2377,2.8585,6.6777,1.6393,1.2224,4.2704,2.1591,0.4266,1.3362,5.1853,6.6786,3.6605,0.2001,0.4334,0.9325,0.0291,1.9884,4.0494,0.6077,0.2069,3.2595,0.3798,0.8478,0.0002,2.5569,2.5869,1.17,1.7088,5.6546,0.4204,1.4237,3.7896,0.9157,3.4965,4.079,0.283,0.3334,0.6092,6.5867,1.3724,0.5479,0.662,4.424,4.7375,4.5103,1.4827,3.4861,1.3064,2.5549,4.615,3.4686,5.937,2.8661,1.7246,4.8122,0.5811,1.7958,1.8274,2.2355,1.8875,6.3649,1.8439,2.8745,6.9139,3.1625,1.5725,3.641,0.4231,1.9805,0.4854,2.679,0.8832,4.5202,0.5726,2.1724,1.4977,0.418,4.3986,0.3192,1.8216,0.0002,5.2702,4.6922,2.2557,4.3438,1.2333,5.3792,1.722,5.9124,5.3167,1.4478,3.5142,2.3622,1.1369,1.1122,6.6741,0.264,0.012,4.4124,1.5393,0.8033,4.6634,0.4297]}

He and his brother are on the road along with his friend and one of his friends, Mr. Stoneman. Stoneman (then 25) tells the teacher that he will be there and his friend is going home. The teacher asks them to take a picture of him at lunch and tell her that \"Puff\" is the name of the person next to him on the road.\n\n\"Puff\" is actually that little boy in the book. Stoneman has a few more pictures of him at lunch but his name is \"Pulaski\". As the boy has had some difficulty communicating with everyone in and around the school, his mother is always the one being talked to. Puff asks his teacher to take them up on that offer. \"Pulaski\" (meaning \"prayer,\" as in \"love,\" or \"for the sake of Jesus\") is the middle name of both of Puff's classmates. He has his last name, but also his first name. But when Stoneman finds out that at lunch, both of the classmates have had a struggle. There is no \"chicken\" in the picture, and the name is \"Pulaski.\n\nThe author states that \"It is said that this is a child with some kind of learning difficulties. These things are really difficult for a youngster to comprehend.\"\n\nThe book comes pre-loaded with references of the time of his life (in English) to help explain how the school handled the situation. \"Pulaski is an independent child\" is a theme of the novel.\n\nA second chapter (in English), entitled \"Pulaski's Story\" is released.\n\nThe author states that \"In the fourth and final chapter, the reader will discover that when Stoneman finds out that Pulaski has reached the ninth grade, he will probably be a high school student too [and] not an adolescent!\"","token_len":501,"entropy":[7.3022,7.7007,0.1504,3.8448,2.0012,2.0703,3.0994,0.82,2.5718,5.6122,8.8427,0.8739,1.0947,0.2459,0.0346,2.3488,3.5642,4.5715,2.3502,1.0323,1.7598,2.1842,4.3502,9.165,0.6835,0.5641,0.2605,2.487,0.0356,2.3378,4.7929,1.6247,1.8641,3.3641,0.0162,7.0814,3.1008,1.8661,4.1537,0.1969,0.9676,2.6024,0.8526,4.7171,5.8069,0.3805,0.0167,0.1785,0.0014,5.4749,3.8597,2.3742,2.3414,2.517,2.9748,6.0578,1.2742,0.545,1.4698,4.3217,1.5128,7.8298,2.6695,1.373,3.4256,3.9689,6.8716,2.8746,1.1706,0.4286,4.2239,3.3539,0.9676,2.0357,2.624,4.6851,3.2299,5.5966,1.0782,1.0975,2.5293,5.3182,1.8894,1.0202,2.3483,4.6119,4.588,1.1412,1.0681,3.1179,1.2779,5.3708,4.6075,5.2431,2.9033,3.5779,2.4523,1.729,5.7173,1.6819,4.6675,4.2255,0.9597,1.5975,4.067,0.2523,3.3063,2.3128,4.2665,1.8074,2.5198,6.4585,1.1136,1.073,4.2928,2.0159,6.0438,0.5946,0.2972,1.5983,0.9311,4.4308,0.9827,5.8521,5.1656,1.0805,1.0104,6.0657,0.0083,0.0007,5.3782,5.2769,6.1422,0.3852,4.4455,1.3278,6.7111,1.0421,0.9505,3.9617,1.4838,5.6935,4.0179,4.6417,2.2115,2.8222,2.3367,4.6507,1.2935,2.0918,0.7078,2.5897,3.8456,0.8324,3.0798,1.15,1.3051,0.6931,2.1432,4.3384,5.0274,2.4472,3.9853,4.9481,2.8685,3.4187,1.3884,0.0084,1.036,0.9203,2.6956,4.6328,0.292,1.1863,3.2318,5.5732,0.1363,0.5868,3.1524,0.1572,0.7381,0.3535,1.8266,0.0002,3.426,1.4144,0.0244,0.3547,1.2424,4.4531,6.34,2.9767,1.0841,3.8368,0.3357,1.4827,1.4223,4.449,0.0016,0.0005,3.349,2.3246,4.9757,2.6548,3.7558,0.9568,0.713,3.281,1.0746,3.624,3.7033,2.8439,0.3505,3.3619,1.3059,9.1904,4.1659,0.5987,0.6538,4.4441,1.5835,3.8296,4.8623,5.7539,3.0293,3.8337,5.0664,0.4171,5.6249,2.3124,7.9296,0.1459,2.286,1.657,0.2989,2.8025,1.829,3.072,5.1995,4.1314,0.7526,6.7596,5.4601,0.0912,0.8391,4.7806,0.0383,4.4988,2.293,2.7294,1.1631,2.3336,5.0857,4.4904,1.4744,3.953,0.301,0.9043,3.6139,0.6633,1.7449,0.0053,0.0133,0.2081,5.0289,3.9781,0.3975,5.1423,2.6168,5.025,3.2099,1.1215,0.6574,6.571,2.3751,1.697,0.3348,6.2267,3.2261,1.6026,0.0039,4.6863,0.4128,0.4482,1.4486,6.2154,0.1705,0.5258,5.9998,3.2759,2.9333,0.0587,0.0509,4.4243,0.8275,2.6289,2.6462,4.2246,6.5037,0.2785,2.9137,3.2848,4.4296,1.6912,2.5865,0.1599,1.2935,5.0337,2.9231,3.945,0.0029,0.0002,4.6048,0.4355,0.5002,7.2357,1.9852,1.7115,5.5388,0.9593,2.192,4.34,1.9763,3.3666,1.6751,6.5289,5.7423,5.1571,0.6596,2.0802,4.3534,8.1616,2.282,1.706,1.6099,0.6478,1.037,1.2188,2.134,1.548,5.2638,1.5276,2.3768,0.7314,1.9056,0.0091,0.0109,5.5441,2.3598,0.0002,1.7485,5.7657,4.7263,0.4431,1.962,4.8673,0.8909,4.1141,0.2298,4.1223,2.3221,2.1645,4.8063,4.4764,4.7411,2.7445,0.0027,6.1143,3.8376,1.5003,5.0485,3.8687,1.0334,5.3637,2.1806,1.0126,1.5462,5.4689,1.4204,4.0784,2.2357,1.9645,0.0002,1.7054,1.2772,4.49,6.4264,0.4344,1.0851,0.0906,5.1005,5.4727,2.9769,5.4758,3.5119,3.0776,1.5037,3.8667,3.6463,2.7524,2.0485,3.3906,4.4757,2.609,2.321,2.2966,4.0526,6.2388,1.21,1.1498,0.5594,3.4023,1.9886,2.5361,0.0043,0.0109,3.1124,3.7656,6.6985,2.9068,4.3216,1.7169,1.856,6.7651,2.7827,0.3109,4.9025,0.6425,1.4759,0.0002,3.867,4.1602,3.0966,4.0796,3.2077,0.4319,3.1205,2.9029,0.19,2.3795,0.9869,0.0047,0.0481,1.2198,3.3201,1.9837,1.5211,5.4079,2.4172,2.342,0.0002,1.7487,2.5845,2.0447,0.3749,1.1609,3.699,1.3056,6.0466,3.0755,1.2829,0.8173,1.1364,1.8023,5.0347,2.4811,2.9407,0.6162,4.2827,4.8524,0.0121,0.0005,4.5257,0.5702,0.4589,5.9811,0.0017,0.0073,1.5979,6.6122,1.6653,5.0033,0.2406,0.3054,0.7082,2.6248,5.0545,1.6072,3.63,6.3546,0.1508,1.1518,4.9208,7.8166,2.6166,0.9601,3.463,3.01,6.33,5.8696]}

When you spy a raccoon fumbling with the latch on a dumpster, you start to wonder.\n\nThe cat is a stray. I have never seen a raccoons home.\n\nA rathian, who is a resident of an abandoned abandoned house, sits near me in an abandoned house surrounded by large rathians. I wonder what the cat is up to.\n\nI believe cats are a natural form of communication between humans and nature,. Cats don\u2019t like to bark because they are scared of predators, and being attacked makes them better able to communicate.\n\nSo the way you\u2019re doing the cat thing sounds like you have a cat problem. She\u2019s never been as friendly as you thought you were at first.\n\nYou should give the raccoon some medicine to help out.\n\nHe also needs a litter box or an air conditioning unit and that is in most areas.\n\nAnother thing you should do is take him out of the house so he can do his thing with the litter box.\n\nHow do you know what the raccoon and I are like?.\n\nThe raccoon, as described earlier, has a tail where it is placed up, behind his ears and where it is placed under his eyes. That tail is usually around the head where you can find the pet food you need to keep him sane and happy.\n\nThe raccoon who got married last semester, but also has a dog, has very little trouble with my dog. He also has that kind of a temperament, a very sweet and caring demeanor.\n\nThe cat is a loose and scared of rats. There are many raccoons that go on adventures in the woods and at night.\n\nI want to share with you some photos from my camera. I came up with some really awesome photos like this, but the important thing is that these are amazing!\n\nIn addition to all of this, I took a few more photos of my pet rats. I took this photo as I was driving my daughter in the car. I\u2019m so happy with my little one!\n\nHave you ever wanted to see some new pets at animals rescue camps in Oregon? How about you visit us at Dog Rescue Oregon and adopt these cats for free.","token_len":502,"entropy":[9.9645,0.0801,3.7691,0.6601,3.3403,1.8414,0.8073,0.016,2.4943,5.9276,6.6167,3.9789,8.8506,2.9375,6.8207,3.0307,6.5857,2.6691,2.9202,0.981,9.6053,0.9697,2.7427,7.5124,7.2484,1.4749,0.8393,6.4984,1.2889,4.7335,0.6369,4.1524,0.3826,10.5558,2.1657,8.2956,0.0107,6.7893,2.5641,0.965,2.3636,5.3423,1.6125,2.015,7.5684,0.0636,0.675,0.7817,5.1619,0.8674,2.2147,4.5935,2.1654,0.0016,2.8486,3.2274,1.6621,2.8432,5.6794,1.7868,4.4734,3.2986,2.0958,0.6541,1.1796,1.5347,6.6312,0.9019,6.0002,1.3031,2.0034,0.0002,3.8455,6.48,6.799,5.9388,3.2933,3.2558,2.2757,2.655,4.1407,0.3129,4.9031,2.5898,5.1488,1.603,0.7139,5.1186,4.9823,2.4827,2.5331,3.2611,3.0408,1.8439,5.3117,0.0167,5.8128,5.2021,0.344,1.928,0.458,2.1949,3.8479,1.7218,2.285,1.8639,0.9795,2.105,0.0086,0.4108,0.8487,0.0002,1.8789,6.1539,5.072,0.6774,3.319,3.3453,4.8796,0.0609,3.2078,3.0927,1.0985,0.3128,4.142,13.0438,4.2957,3.8624,14.3541,7.5264,0.7336,2.689,1.3374,6.3378,4.2203,0.7325,1.4856,2.8653,0.9237,3.9289,2.0912,1.3913,6.4345,5.8928,4.5439,0.5707,5.8821,3.665,0.0089,1.3106,1.0483,1.4045,0.0003,4.4585,3.8622,5.8362,2.9323,9.4892,0.5882,2.3786,3.4149,3.8777,2.2033,3.1701,5.3437,1.4693,2.4771,2.9431,1.501,3.0079,2.0506,0.4041,6.5749,2.436,0.1713,1.3781,6.0961,1.5479,6.2762,3.5557,0.7507,1.3264,3.9256,3.9336,1.5864,6.4024,0.5951,0.4363,1.05,0.0002,2.7128,4.6888,5.1235,2.6093,1.5366,0.0547,3.0908,7.1689,2.6636,2.4254,6.4561,0.7172,1.0656,0.0002,5.4579,5.2362,2.7746,1.6856,4.4044,0.2969,3.924,4.4332,3.263,2.6484,1.1035,4.0446,4.0416,1.7065,5.3025,4.5394,4.1394,1.8799,0.8364,0.0002,5.2753,2.6259,1.2478,1.0644,0.8981,0.6409,3.3119,2.5265,1.6904,0.9717,0.4889,0.5481,3.8884,0.7042,0.6919,5.2284,1.7749,1.367,3.0501,2.1566,2.3672,0.0875,0.5964,0.7089,0.0002,5.2626,1.6504,0.5366,2.8482,2.552,2.2727,1.2626,0.0106,5.636,4.0803,0.6127,4.3214,0.2971,9.3631,0.6,0.0002,2.6683,0.5257,0.0156,4.1966,3.0655,4.4338,3.3592,0.1525,2.54,1.068,5.1561,6.7614,1.2024,3.0027,5.9107,5.8796,4.5976,5.9117,2.3144,1.7179,2.0873,5.8678,0.846,1.7153,1.8123,3.9692,0.4855,3.1574,0.2553,4.9623,0.6228,0.6722,4.1667,3.6805,1.3421,2.8164,3.9698,3.4156,2.057,3.7412,1.5024,5.9461,5.0616,3.6671,2.0813,2.3564,2.2001,1.7091,6.6397,1.8741,1.7751,0.1456,0.4128,0.0002,1.6723,0.6302,0.0036,7.6957,6.446,7.8442,4.2416,7.279,2.58,4.8995,5.6056,2.285,0.9195,2.9234,0.6359,1.7897,4.8221,2.5301,5.2826,1.7063,5.0851,3.2484,0.9513,1.6435,3.9629,1.4484,6.6761,5.3219,0.0044,3.3939,4.5247,2.551,4.0649,2.865,4.8766,2.0976,3.694,2.8778,0.6304,0.5464,0.0002,2.1607,2.2506,1.6071,1.5273,6.8173,3.6065,6.3223,6.1102,3.978,0.7262,4.9346,0.8186,2.5467,4.4282,0.2164,0.0012,1.7868,4.3901,3.1162,3.3224,2.4948,0.7226,0.915,1.6633,5.0442,0.5443,0.9596,1.3457,0.0002,2.2824,4.0526,0.6019,4.8091,1.3604,0.0644,2.1934,4.5451,2.5128,1.0785,8.0469,2.2723,2.1505,6.412,2.0397,0.0366,2.3825,4.6718,4.2289,2.1227,5.7289,0.8954,3.6257,2.9732,2.9703,5.2664,0.9594,0.4655,1.0017,2.9077,1.3428,6.3296,4.3594,0.6309,0.0002,4.6565,3.0619,0.2238,3.7903,1.0699,2.5909,0.6959,0.8756,5.1997,1.2762,2.3519,3.0007,1.1564,0.9952,1.7571,4.2165,6.7519,1.1229,1.9735,3.3847,4.242,1.9251,4.1651,2.3835,0.8251,3.842,3.386,5.5521,4.583,1.1276,0.8743,1.0726,1.747,9.8474,0.7229,0.7069,3.5854,1.9537,2.5877,2.1095,4.2136,4.1345,2.0531,0.4382,0.0002,5.5739,0.9493,0.7379,3.8192,0.1014,2.1537,3.691,5.3127,3.3084,4.5203,9.1514,6.9695,4.0601,3.1915,4.5649,0.2369,4.9391,0.4236,1.9059,5.5704,3.5648,1.2931,6.0195,1.4166,3.0839,2.0358,6.8042,4.1353,3.2056,3.011,3.4411,2.2826]}

Unfortunately, you don't know when.\nI don't know, but I have gotten very attached to a close friend and best friend since she was a child, and while she has given up on me, she still keeps me in their hearts.  I have a feeling she had an underlying reason; she lost something dear to her.  And because she will leave us, I can't imagine how this pain will be felt.\nI can't tell by how much, but there is one thing you can do: keep her.  Your friend had an amazing gift.  If the friend who had the gift won't allow you to understand who she is as your mom, then be willing to be his mother and support her whenever you need them.  And while you're gone, you have a new friend who is in constant contact with you, and that is very important to you both.  You may have been more than just a friends wife but you have to respect that.\nSo my friend had the gift, and she only wanted to be a friend to him. So she was willing to help me, as long as me and my friend got to enjoy each other's company while we were apart. I mean... I guess that would make me more than just a friend. But... this is so awful... I know she wanted this too... right?\nThere is no right or wrong way to feel for your friend. You are doing wrong.  She needed the friendship to be enough for you both to care about one another.\nI know right? That would be sad, and I actually believe her right to take the time to talk to me while I had some sleep.  Oh, well.. it's been a week.  And oh my.  I had no reason to doubt.  I just didn't feel comfortable telling her of my friend's friend's gift, it seems to have come up again.\nDo you know why she wanted to help you so much?  Do you know why she got so upset about something as personal as who you are with?\nI don't know, and I'm pretty sure she thought she was hurting her friend's best friend. She probably thought she was hurting myself. But it's been so long since they were at each other's throats, that she probably felt like she made a bad mistake or made a mistake of her own.","token_len":503,"entropy":[5.3684,3.8334,2.491,2.223,8.5425,10.7918,10.0609,2.8652,4.1186,2.2999,8.8517,5.3224,2.8366,2.3318,5.7429,1.3009,7.0652,0.3482,1.9538,3.2651,0.0007,1.6994,3.0027,3.2017,1.616,7.8401,3.51,0.0008,1.0986,3.6113,1.4993,0.897,3.2188,5.965,4.0891,4.6256,0.0515,3.7997,7.664,0.2636,2.6497,6.9454,0.0435,4.1182,4.4892,0.67,1.5768,2.0882,1.9339,0.8235,5.5846,1.7014,2.5565,4.4001,2.7755,1.1025,1.376,1.0054,1.4433,2.3712,3.5949,1.3999,2.0804,5.6948,2.1275,0.6312,7.8789,7.8429,2.5556,2.5902,3.891,1.6148,5.6737,3.0564,6.8096,4.2949,6.4104,1.1514,4.8339,4.434,3.1999,0.3613,0.2102,1.853,1.5887,3.6842,5.1104,1.6772,5.177,5.8923,2.2001,1.6171,1.235,2.7626,0.4871,2.9033,1.4593,4.0334,6.3564,1.0159,2.3253,1.5545,1.6146,1.2761,1.3765,2.9865,0.4156,3.6738,7.6055,2.9024,1.2504,2.7488,0.3746,4.1538,0.9157,3.3672,0.5206,4.4884,0.9849,0.8749,2.8812,4.4516,2.9653,1.7313,0.7472,5.0788,4.0609,5.3003,2.6299,3.5025,3.8685,2.4837,0.4621,4.664,4.8554,6.0386,3.8506,3.3845,2.142,0.5827,4.9238,0.3504,5.0585,0.6703,0.1369,7.1686,5.2766,0.6484,0.5858,5.5745,4.601,5.5034,1.019,2.3766,6.0971,3.7656,0.0332,3.8763,5.073,3.0491,2.9143,4.4809,0.5416,6.2635,1.3317,0.9097,4.2122,0.3402,1.0074,2.9868,4.8726,1.1597,2.2232,6.1548,0.2301,2.0326,3.8046,1.5648,3.3249,1.1783,1.4971,2.0069,3.9288,4.9617,2.3179,0.0614,0.3431,1.5913,1.1346,3.1858,2.4499,4.1917,0.8838,1.3674,0.5602,6.6627,0.1949,1.1512,2.3979,3.9333,2.1827,3.2319,5.7768,2.1992,2.6557,0.7473,7.4354,8.4373,4.3979,1.6227,1.9434,4.0146,4.7673,1.7031,1.0833,1.3346,3.8249,5.4683,2.6196,5.1349,2.3954,0.4448,2.5028,0.7366,1.7228,6.6438,2.548,0.6019,1.7306,2.7556,2.347,2.3679,5.2281,0.6292,4.6725,1.9784,3.0764,1.9805,0.0337,3.3333,3.2194,2.5763,4.4038,2.0115,0.0282,7.705,2.3048,1.432,2.9008,4.9706,2.5471,5.617,0.7395,0.0309,0.5142,0.0337,4.5482,0.9205,0.977,4.4429,0.2693,3.1775,4.618,5.0668,2.0805,3.8027,1.8902,3.8298,2.5233,2.4506,3.448,2.1185,1.178,0.4288,1.1311,1.0497,3.1209,3.8125,4.2103,1.0429,3.7927,6.0432,3.4191,1.915,4.0582,3.5201,4.5745,3.6023,4.137,2.8031,5.6801,0.2701,1.3443,4.8655,1.0854,1.6336,5.4446,0.7943,0.0095,1.1628,0.2277,3.712,4.1297,2.4503,1.8609,0.8745,3.0372,2.1868,5.6959,5.3033,1.0833,0.7293,4.1895,5.8698,3.4392,4.8232,2.2496,1.6971,7.0882,2.1463,1.9926,5.1363,0.9022,4.859,1.2997,2.9073,0.0086,0.6283,2.6304,2.1424,2.051,6.4403,2.0184,4.4367,3.9694,0.5272,5.7391,1.4465,2.9581,1.4164,7.2223,4.1684,4.0508,3.465,3.1484,5.291,2.3827,2.066,0.2181,3.3542,0.8902,2.826,5.7051,0.6766,5.8404,3.9282,5.1614,0.675,0.4815,6.2534,0.739,3.8195,6.4097,3.5952,1.0804,2.9693,0.8974,4.8558,2.0519,0.562,2.8506,6.2096,2.7205,3.5139,0.3202,1.5216,5.0207,3.0377,5.4858,0.2558,4.1607,5.02,0.4346,1.4977,2.4704,2.7469,0.0022,2.3731,3.1689,3.6979,0.4737,5.814,1.3091,4.9857,0.167,7.6334,2.0956,5.5114,2.2537,5.4505,4.8638,1.9965,2.7321,3.8913,4.3889,3.7275,1.2824,1.3706,6.0252,0.391,1.7467,2.4353,1.7905,3.6477,0.9795,2.4489,0.5078,4.0382,0.4382,0.1936,0.3152,4.8629,0.0206,0.3275,0.4644,0.2344,5.228,1.1686,2.1089,2.2249,4.6263,5.3956,3.4115,0.0677,6.7919,1.4893,1.6061,3.0227,0.6424,3.1322,1.6712,1.8727,0.0012,0.2938,1.0274,3.3947,0.4719,2.4137,4.1691,0.0533,1.0514,4.1478,2.2335,1.0028,5.5253,2.7042,2.2451,2.5967,5.9721,0.0206,1.1834,5.0615,3.9688,1.3498,0.8479,0.4251,1.3097,4.7082,1.2038,3.4412,2.8295,1.5752,3.2553,2.2354,0.5033,0.2667,4.6511,2.5748,5.8271,2.5891,0.0318,0.3187,0.2202,1.3999,3.5354,1.8537,3.5459,2.9403,1.9266,0.8816,6.3551,1.4042,2.8729,3.3645,3.8227,4.2311,0.9367,1.8475,3.1677,1.3177,0.0488,0.4182]}
{"id":4974,"ended":true,"length":471,"text":"After getting his ring back from the engraver, Sauron realizes it mistakenly says `` One Ring To Rule The Mall ''. So the ring is the ring of the Dark Lord, who has a magical life and can change the world forever. It will end when Sauron is imprisoned by Sauron's dragon.\n\nAfter defeating the dragon, Sauron finds himself transported to a different dimension. There he meets Elia, the wizard from the previous realm. He soon discovers she is named Elia. She is the one who kidnapped Sauron and saved his life. She is one of the great sorcerers who is now searching for Elia. To her surprise, Elia is only there to defeat her because everything else in her life is controlled by evil. She knows what he is capable of, and she believes him to be the good one. After killing Elia, Sauron returns to his home world and asks for the ring. All that is needed are the two of them to become friends, all of their actions being recorded by Elia and Sauron. They give the ring to him and, using it for his good use, break and destroy the castle. Sauron is able to defeat her, and she is taken back to where Sauron was. His life was taken in her house, but she is still trapped in it forever. They both leave at once, although the two of them continue their adventure. To this day, Elia believes Sauron is the good one because he knows for sure of the truth of Elia's story.\n\nOnce back home and free from the evil who destroyed the realm, Elia begins her search to recover her power. She finds the ring and is shocked by the fact that it was given to her by Elia. The ring made of ice, but to her horror, it turns out it was the one she saw in the night. When she returns to the castle, Elia is destroyed.\n\nIn the meantime, Elia is unable to gain a better explanation for the ring. He is going to lose it as he is a monster of death. So she is now led on a mission to find out the truth. Now Elia cannot remember her own identity. However, she knows it was her idea, and she must come home for an explanation.\n\nAt least she got her wish, but at this level, she will not come back to the realm, which will be her last resting place after this journey.","token_len":504,"entropy":[6.4602,3.4829,6.999,2.3977,2.3623,1.3616,11.6667,0.2842,1.8117,0.5723,9.196,0.9869,7.2689,3.4359,12.4685,4.7975,9.4595,11.7665,2.5911,6.3888,4.1816,3.082,12.4306,5.5942,4.7205,3.9536,3.3711,2.6849,1.0149,3.7675,3.4878,0.7193,1.4387,5.9388,0.1834,1.9069,3.2127,2.442,3.406,4.7009,6.458,3.2614,3.7765,3.7255,1.8191,1.1209,2.6956,0.4442,3.475,4.0999,5.0436,3.155,2.0637,0.0004,2.4822,7.0821,1.9917,3.3516,0.0063,1.3622,6.4054,1.7896,3.8011,0.0257,3.9605,3.4444,1.0567,1.0619,0.4424,0.9343,0.0007,3.762,1.7855,5.4196,0.7419,1.809,3.0122,0.9633,1.8159,2.6043,1.1232,1.2108,6.0907,3.6438,1.4701,1.7262,6.4666,4.3066,0.9664,4.4035,5.9935,1.1394,2.0761,5.871,2.1803,3.3314,0.843,6.4945,2.8855,0.1592,2.218,1.6567,1.4735,1.9161,4.1058,0.3143,6.3787,1.2943,0.0012,1.1213,4.7163,1.215,0.3871,0.4463,1.6995,1.9278,4.0335,0.086,0.2956,5.3758,1.464,0.2326,2.5651,4.3187,3.1651,6.9019,0.0666,3.5383,0.0122,0.6083,5.6414,3.2373,2.2001,0.19,1.5088,0.0025,1.653,5.2472,4.3623,0.6197,5.6244,2.5483,5.6075,7.6626,3.8473,2.3807,1.4347,0.8326,1.0477,6.1019,0.1639,5.2543,1.173,1.8212,4.5296,3.3158,4.7943,1.5912,2.615,0.0075,1.2358,1.1271,1.2026,4.0998,2.1633,1.1142,0.0275,1.1185,6.3346,0.5512,0.3602,3.7806,4.3085,1.2048,0.0038,0.2805,0.7309,0.0014,3.5449,0.2921,1.2677,2.6108,1.8351,1.4179,4.0247,1.9659,2.1337,1.6609,1.0147,6.4616,2.3785,1.7311,2.9984,3.0883,1.5255,2.7652,1.838,0.057,0.6437,4.8795,1.7716,2.1205,7.2442,1.8158,3.9482,4.3016,2.242,3.5586,2.5398,1.8289,0.0042,2.1354,3.2815,0.0012,0.5194,3.6684,5.7847,2.4759,0.1912,0.1983,3.4659,1.5155,4.7935,4.7216,0.8508,4.9746,1.8136,5.8568,7.8394,0.174,7.3567,5.593,1.8322,0.8059,4.6228,1.2515,3.3889,0.0011,2.3442,3.6579,0.004,2.8802,4.0844,1.8064,1.4594,2.6228,1.6802,3.5843,1.4035,0.1343,4.8121,3.3773,0.0048,1.5505,1.9235,6.0914,3.5945,2.9928,3.1174,3.6881,4.1506,5.6412,1.4101,1.9535,1.9545,2.1103,2.1861,4.6242,1.0104,2.0848,4.9266,0.2527,5.8277,3.274,3.3635,4.9125,2.2331,1.1735,6.2995,2.9348,2.7328,1.2687,0.0038,4.3106,2.3778,4.6611,1.2903,6.632,2.9547,0.2617,0.3272,1.9257,0.0053,4.3021,1.476,0.0018,1.0425,1.3286,2.9257,0.0354,3.0893,1.2307,3.6066,7.0202,0.9739,6.6809,2.2786,3.0806,1.3275,4.1359,0.0088,0.1913,2.6861,0.3478,0.6736,0.0002,5.509,2.7095,3.8209,4.696,4.3801,1.6256,1.0399,3.8424,5.012,4.1348,1.6145,5.454,0.3511,1.2678,0.0046,4.5034,2.8217,1.9988,3.6733,5.2683,1.2323,5.6286,0.6656,0.9446,2.6649,2.1775,1.8873,2.2649,3.288,3.3337,2.5758,1.113,2.4095,0.3058,1.4078,2.0955,3.473,0.1682,0.131,0.6723,2.1445,0.018,0.7039,3.3062,1.4454,7.0717,1.0826,4.6853,2.2873,4.4713,5.9962,0.7624,4.6757,0.4361,0.8814,2.9832,0.7488,2.3312,1.0104,2.8123,2.8069,1.8748,5.5613,1.6685,0.7844,5.7955,1.406,3.1818,0.4176,3.3913,0.4091,1.1735,2.0166,0.4246,2.8374,0.0056,1.9859,7.3908,1.6135,1.9292,0.0001,3.1698,1.0149,3.9641,0.0691,2.0087,0.013,1.7814,5.9582,0.0032,5.8829,3.3006,4.236,4.56,1.1974,1.5273,3.1735,1.5092,5.295,2.2241,5.4932,0.2502,6.2599,1.6635,4.006,1.755,1.5804,3.44,5.0502,3.9631,4.1286,0.9817,3.4359,1.3279,2.9694,5.9939,7.1587,5.0669,0.5199,3.353,0.5467,1.0689,1.8559,2.7984,0.9515,1.6746,5.5236,2.8496,0.0124,5.4201,4.8281,2.7092,3.5316,4.5192,1.6902,3.8955,0.0818,0.7232,3.0304,3.6662,1.4639,2.2312,6.3896,2.8897,0.7171,1.3231,3.3547,4.9693,5.8284,4.6719,5.2958,1.1697,0.2956,1.3627,0.0001,4.7081,5.3054,2.5973,4.7042,2.0198,3.7844,2.1283,3.3148,4.5561,1.989,7.4388,0.9421,1.3452,3.4945,2.1327,4.7757,0.6418,1.2061,1.4066,3.3686,3.6079,3.8437,2.2546,1.5136,2.7493,2.6707,3.4052,0.0147,4.9577,3.8224,2.9375,0.114]}
{"id":526,"ended":true,"length":481,"text":"Mental illness can be forced to manifest into a physical form. You are professional MMA champion hired to beat the depression out of people. You have a doctor who is able to treat you and he can cure you. You can't leave a mentally ill person, you cannot quit smoking. This means you aren't having the same emotional baggage you have. But now you do have more time to heal. Life is going to be a long one. Maybe mentally ill athletes can help themselves to something stronger than this.\n\nThis is one thing that I find funny.\nSometimes, when things go wrong, you get used to it.\nFor instance, if you had never got used to that, there may have been a time when you felt as though you never had to look back. Or you were just going through certain phases \u2014 you were just starting to let go. Or perhaps you were always so focused on getting through it, or you felt like you had to go against your best nature.\nAs you were going through these things, all I could think about was that sometimes, with something as bad as this, or that time when you have to break and forget that you even exist and it\u2019s still happening, there is a mental illness where you want to get rid of it. And as long as you can ignore it and get it under control. If it\u2019s not there, it will just leave you out of this game...\nSo yeah, this sort of thing... this could be for many of us. But mentally ill people who are suffering often at home probably have mental illness (like me) because they can\u2019t get over these symptoms. They can\u2019t do these things because they are fighting with their own health. Sometimes they also find it hard to understand their own mental illnesses to put the brakes on them. If we want to see what can be achieved. And mental illness isn't going away.\n\nThank you for making this video available for free to viewers.

{"id":3390,"ended":true,"length":487,"text":"Your girlfriend is a serial killer who has been at large for years. You found out one day upon walking into her apartment and seeing her at work. You never help her with her hobby or express any signs of discomfort when with her and that just baffles her. You just don't care about it. You have no idea how much you regret it. She will probably tell you about it when you leave and you will get very sad when she has gone off on her own. As if she is an addict, your mom will probably keep telling her.\n>Your girlfriend is a serial killer  You got me there. If she hasn't helped me she's very likely not.\nThis is one thing my ex-girlfriend said to me once: \"Oh I'm glad you're still here. I was so close to dying from being pregnant but the baby was there and I was glad everything was okay.\"  But she never asked if I wanted to try to be his mother and I told her that she can just be my mom. She'll probably tell you that she'll probably never be willing or able to do anything that would make her uncomfortable, she will probably say you were going to murder her.  I would give myself life if I wanted to go back.\nI've never had to murder myself - unless some bloodshot face or piercing eyes and itchy cheeks make me have a very violent reaction (I got pregnant when I was 23, but since then I'm not). People always blame us for it, but I wouldn't call it a crime. People just do things to try out for a chance at revenge and they end up killing themselves.\n>People always blame us for it  But when you turn those words around you're not blaming them. When we get into a game or a relationship or something, we blame ourselves again and again. So the goal is to make our own. Not to blame you. Sometimes you'll find it hard to understand why so many people don't just end it early and kill themselves as well. But don't be afraid to look up and say anything. We give ourselves choices.\nWell thank you for this. I'm actually really excited about her getting back in contact with my ex-girlfriend so I'll get her contact info.\nSo, it is now safe to go out with your ex-girlfriend. Now we're not having to deal with her any more.  Don't worry about losing your gf, the relationship is worth it.","token_len":506,"entropy":[9.5721,1.8912,2.5311,7.4187,0.6377,3.5003,2.5748,1.9596,5.2865,4.7357,0.557,2.5391,0.9359,3.3955,6.9087,1.0811,5.7921,0.5896,9.5212,6.6546,1.1461,1.3283,1.622,2.5507,3.2522,1.176,5.6241,1.8902,0.96,1.4307,5.4204,8.673,0.3174,3.268,1.3988,7.7787,1.6386,9.3005,2.0864,5.1831,0.0948,5.9553,4.6928,8.4434,0.8221,3.8115,4.2527,5.4158,7.044,0.0073,1.6638,0.3656,1.8289,4.4011,3.074,0.0018,2.7687,1.5282,4.2474,0.726,1.575,3.3818,1.5099,1.1447,1.2302,1.897,1.6405,6.5244,1.2514,0.5502,3.1631,3.376,3.883,3.3048,0.1178,2.9006,1.2131,3.6669,0.8441,3.5918,2.4414,1.4632,1.2373,3.9042,4.099,4.0205,3.2805,1.1883,4.6519,5.1783,3.9505,1.4741,2.8472,0.4232,0.6102,5.4766,4.1834,1.9861,2.0729,4.4747,3.7733,1.9695,3.6812,5.4149,1.7276,3.4814,5.5368,3.1084,3.0816,4.3737,1.9096,11.1685,4.6404,1.2842,0.5511,0.271,0.0603,0.0139,10.4623,8.8608,4.5916,6.5101,4.5775,1.3082,4.5726,2.1295,5.2843,0.0005,6.1179,3.0083,5.0163,2.4338,5.6816,2.6148,3.2062,3.4474,2.6067,5.0884,0.8749,3.7603,4.162,4.8785,3.8206,1.9115,1.3015,2.9674,1.192,0.1046,3.2822,1.8497,0.7503,4.3615,3.2571,1.9024,4.0391,0.6499,1.3072,3.6899,1.2326,0.8711,1.2393,3.7428,2.0962,4.92,0.3826,3.8642,5.292,3.9951,4.1619,3.255,4.6245,3.6177,1.6689,5.074,2.0323,0.9905,2.1721,5.0556,7.2445,0.4694,1.2313,1.3805,5.6525,4.7929,2.2706,2.7627,4.1412,2.8091,0.8339,2.0559,0.4112,3.9406,1.2263,4.1572,4.2454,2.5988,3.0626,1.5631,3.9145,0.0347,1.954,3.4185,4.1561,4.5641,2.8896,2.4262,1.3449,1.0245,1.6709,5.0882,2.7151,1.1057,0.297,1.3202,1.418,4.0737,3.8162,2.3814,2.2729,5.0434,5.2568,0.1683,0.009,3.2368,1.6494,4.4416,2.1481,1.5795,1.0081,6.4553,2.8671,4.0698,2.6755,1.0825,2.8416,4.7952,4.0137,4.8477,0.2955,6.2228,0.3617,2.2265,2.7365,2.4365,4.1151,5.2658,6.1684,6.5498,2.9917,0.7047,3.2363,0.2783,4.4114,2.6111,3.0237,1.5803,2.6065,3.2409,2.2473,2.2472,2.8653,6.9344,4.2187,6.7988,6.005,5.4556,7.6557,4.6046,6.6508,3.3428,7.163,4.9281,3.2766,4.3037,6.4528,4.7055,4.0139,0.7965,6.4939,2.2167,4.2501,4.7162,1.3156,4.9079,2.2948,5.3207,3.2394,3.5121,0.401,0.1914,4.217,2.5526,3.3378,4.7889,0.3426,0.3856,2.7834,1.8973,4.7334,6.0348,4.0681,5.9577,4.9273,0.5166,2.1242,1.4898,1.1319,1.6211,5.0778,0.0008,3.6634,0.7642,1.5976,2.6721,1.0464,4.2268,2.804,4.1508,3.1334,1.9349,3.9035,9.3664,2.3862,2.3467,2.7098,1.1843,5.4699,2.5801,3.0515,4.221,0.0081,1.5773,1.5977,0.9312,1.7075,1.921,5.2681,0.6369,0.1114,0.2857,0.0247,0.0619,1.4889,4.7212,3.8211,1.3261,6.3851,6.4704,5.0191,1.8434,1.8425,2.9,2.9949,5.1325,2.733,0.9107,4.142,4.4769,3.6502,3.0022,1.5323,5.8854,3.2773,1.9998,2.4081,1.7446,2.4605,2.0096,1.0449,4.2446,0.8604,6.8799,1.6894,0.1536,0.5415,4.6976,4.0807,6.2706,0.6182,0.525,2.2469,4.1011,2.9897,5.049,5.1279,0.8133,3.4434,2.4042,1.3904,5.7256,2.2307,3.2619,3.1268,2.6392,1.3944,0.1662,3.3502,1.3666,5.018,0.0822,0.2679,2.9878,0.0006,4.5862,6.7273,4.8997,7.057,1.7741,4.7197,0.1497,5.1312,4.1536,0.4185,2.8505,5.0035,0.0002,2.4688,1.3961,0.3926,4.3417,4.5987,2.4808,1.6424,6.1599,1.2744,3.8402,7.0173,1.0891,8.763,1.3549,2.4993,6.4155,7.3677,0.1209,0.623,3.752,1.7128,1.5247,1.9099,5.7627,3.2115,3.6712,1.1418,5.8392,4.5852,2.0995,2.5709,4.4715,0.1606,3.7581,1.292,1.4813,0.5459,4.0106,0.9598,2.978,4.1222,2.1194,6.8598,1.8404,2.1483,1.925,4.2068,2.324,4.4062,3.1476,3.9469,6.1952,0.2097,3.7847,3.1579,2.0389,2.4369,1.6287,1.3882,0.1298,1.0437,4.2068,3.675,1.8606,2.7966,3.9322,2.9382,3.1695,0.0055,2.2724,4.9384,0.4754,0.7126,4.0602,6.0412,0.0006,1.421,0.7353,5.8107,1.8984,8.9065,1.3912,2.0867,4.7884,3.6086,1.03,5.8037,0.4281,0.4584]}

{"id":1429,"ended":true,"length":492,"text":"You live in a world where everyone ages at different rates. The cause for aging quickly versus aging slowly is unknown.\nI don't think I'm aging quickly. I'm a much younger person and I'm not aging slowly. I'm just aging a little faster than I am. The problem is that I can't afford to be at a different social club I go to every day so I can't do the things I can't do at home. I can't even get ahold of my cell phone and I can't find the help I need.  That being said, I would never put a person at a similar place if they had never got married.\nYou're probably in a relationship.  You can only get to know your partner by asking what he does\/does not do.  If you're just starting to date a \"friend\", it's probably time to get back to work or go get something (I guess I can do that, though I think there may be a more optimal method.  I've been known to ask my boyfriend where he lives.  Not a sure thing.)\nI have, but I work for a real company and he lives off of my salary and takes me out on one of my outings. My manager is married but I can't take him out. I asked for an hour and half before he went home, although at that point I was already very exhausted. We both work long hours but I still get a lot of calls asking me for an Uber to pick him up.\nYou can usually find him at your school or church (like me) or wherever the person you need to meet is.  I wouldn't put the person in a position where they'd be able to ask you out on any of those things.  As a kid I knew a guy who was a lot older than I but had trouble getting over his age like most, but when he came out he was totally attractive.  And it was sooooo hot.  He just kept getting hotter.  At any rate I wouldn't be surprised if you start taking him in the next few years to see what he likes.\nThank you for your advice. I've never been to church or any religious gatherings so it would be really cool to see what he likes or doesn't like. But it's been so long since they were at church. He told me that he got a lot of support at work and work from home since he had a lot of friends that work in a similar field.","token_len":509,"entropy":[6.9476,0.4318,1.4643,3.3747,0.5086,4.376,9.7566,4.5461,2.4189,2.6358,1.6191,3.3347,9.115,2.7952,7.1308,8.0464,9.7939,3.3551,1.6514,0.4433,5.2506,0.6425,2.3106,9.1885,3.3188,0.0006,1.4458,2.4835,1.5982,9.6648,4.5514,1.3681,0.8936,1.435,3.7787,5.5267,1.2468,0.5898,2.4823,0.98,1.2942,2.4097,5.2529,1.5148,0.271,1.2012,1.1158,2.9065,4.3044,5.041,0.5964,2.147,0.7584,1.5088,3.7539,1.3881,3.6643,3.7394,0.4743,0.9524,1.6375,3.1662,0.2457,4.1399,0.585,3.0143,4.8157,1.8908,3.4963,7.6515,6.4132,6.8924,4.663,0.0503,1.7206,1.986,5.1082,0.5175,1.9016,0.7143,3.3755,2.6408,1.2785,0.5172,4.6754,3.089,0.3776,2.7,0.3471,0.3557,1.4027,1.7207,0.1482,3.5071,2.4123,1.8034,7.8854,0.0028,1.3764,3.4942,0.0915,2.6175,1.4512,0.6858,0.0363,3.8599,2.448,5.6865,0.3782,0.1261,0.9111,8.7899,10.2889,5.272,0.0139,0.2525,0.6004,4.4136,3.374,4.5074,2.8401,4.7205,1.9612,1.0881,5.5358,3.957,4.1487,1.15,2.6292,4.4534,5.5964,2.4969,0.9116,1.7461,3.9255,2.5316,3.1556,4.303,1.0693,3.0346,2.5604,3.2934,1.8918,3.7905,4.7252,2.0272,3.7597,1.9442,2.4361,1.548,2.6878,4.6106,5.3632,1.9543,1.9825,6.4872,1.0595,0.3689,0.3574,0.8876,0.6796,2.6176,0.7502,1.6843,4.6674,2.5649,3.0711,3.2146,3.2031,6.5919,1.7609,1.7193,2.8896,0.756,1.6775,3.8873,0.2763,2.48,3.9328,0.7762,3.1085,3.0314,2.9548,4.6086,3.9541,6.1463,3.3895,4.4963,2.1823,2.8303,3.1678,0.9799,2.8724,3.2362,1.9546,3.9849,3.6277,3.8251,0.1443,1.4928,3.9695,5.6197,4.2248,4.5843,1.4082,1.577,2.937,1.83,6.289,0.0291,3.4528,2.3896,2.272,5.1213,0.4,2.4462,2.618,0.4041,5.8522,3.9723,4.6423,0.3428,3.3183,0.8683,1.8858,3.0341,6.4541,3.5521,0.6587,8.0049,2.6132,0.7108,5.1955,1.7878,1.7521,5.7305,5.4256,3.7086,1.1683,2.1058,1.5412,2.0997,6.5828,3.7724,2.0578,1.98,6.4965,0.7378,1.7956,4.5348,0.8162,4.7291,5.276,2.2007,5.6404,3.077,1.6145,3.1449,0.2146,4.2903,1.9156,0.535,3.2424,1.8338,5.6286,2.8977,2.6455,4.5324,2.121,3.5134,4.9096,1.5339,2.8066,3.1039,2.1974,7.0306,5.8152,1.6494,0.4543,0.7423,1.6979,3.3563,4.9395,3.7037,0.7387,4.4885,3.8421,4.5588,4.2224,0.0988,3.4999,1.403,3.7253,3.4858,2.543,1.3779,0.1737,3.5196,4.6172,1.6629,2.6011,3.2617,6.1578,2.8253,3.6396,3.024,0.0048,0.7233,1.5471,2.8408,2.7294,5.5784,1.7763,3.6146,1.4571,2.6984,6.5131,1.4408,3.9233,3.7467,4.6414,5.3664,1.3838,1.7311,4.4337,4.3169,4.5169,1.4921,6.0799,0.8381,2.224,1.1533,0.8151,0.9028,1.8292,5.8136,0.0007,3.9076,3.9937,1.9959,1.7093,0.9922,2.5804,0.5703,1.1278,2.8856,1.0938,1.0908,0.0033,3.6129,2.0215,3.0681,1.8175,5.1864,2.36,2.5071,2.5367,0.574,1.0022,5.1096,2.1601,4.4034,1.1894,4.7953,2.414,1.8984,0.6969,1.5102,2.1309,4.3731,1.1987,0.2856,1.2237,5.3444,3.3843,5.4539,1.6299,3.6733,2.5575,1.9491,8.6154,3.5382,5.3993,1.795,4.2823,1.1867,2.4844,1.627,1.6608,0.8985,5.1263,7.3989,0.8501,0.6704,4.43,3.6803,1.178,4.147,6.2361,3.5827,1.3803,0.6992,2.0553,4.5549,3.2152,2.1998,4.3284,1.1998,0.9442,4.7731,4.762,1.2162,2.2317,4.4077,0.0008,2.5336,2.0839,0.1392,3.1962,4.9005,4.8985,1.4643,4.6164,3.1257,2.4446,2.0182,1.28,3.2034,1.4432,1.9255,1.3616,3.9076,1.0726,0.7335,7.618,0.1242,0.7488,2.0514,4.3051,0.8105,2.1344,2.8897,2.9143,1.8248,2.9025,5.0482,1.5859,2.9416,3.4268,4.9459,4.0295,2.5908,3.0398,0.2826,3.4198,1.9782,0.7735,1.6835,1.6155,1.2911,1.5703,3.5735,1.1934,0.0001,0.0408,0.5013,4.4276,3.0626,0.8492,4.304,2.8834,1.3837,0.3761,6.1733,3.3248,3.2662,2.0458,2.3649,4.649,5.5047,0.0456,1.6115,0.927,5.0251,2.4227,1.0695,0.2275,3.8284,3.7328,4.0284,1.416,5.9964,3.7674,6.4987,5.5261,0.7049,3.3373,2.1302,2.2563,0.0653,1.5337,3.2322,4.7863,1.9451,4.1048,2.2658,2.2082,0.5011]}

It further adds that there is no indication that the company will be able to replace them or that they will disappear entirely, as it continues to search for replacements.\n\nAs per the Mail article, one employee left his position to replace a temporary manager, while another person worked part-time as a marketing intern, after the change.\n\nIn a statement, the company said, \u201cWe have been devastated by this loss and are fully aware that it is not true, but also that our employees will most likely not return.\n\n\u201cOur immediate and largest priority is to minimise damage to the company by ensuring that we all recover from the financial impact of the loss and to ensure our employees receive the compensation intended for them.\n\n\u201cIt is important to mention that some of these employees are taking temporary positions as we continue to conduct our due diligence to ensure they are well compensated, given that they are of the required age for the position.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to reassure everyone that we will continue to support their employment, and support their local businesses, in the short term and beyond as they go through this painful chapter of their history,\u201d the spokesperson continued.\n\nThe company would like to add that it would \u201ccancel the contract of an employee\u201d it had been \u2018negotiating at this level\u2019, because of the current condition of the business.","token_len":509,"entropy":[8.7058,9.4549,1.869,3.7319,8.323,4.1749,6.1945,0.0663,0.87,8.7149,4.8455,5.4854,2.0981,2.0421,2.6689,2.1286,0.6341,11.102,3.811,4.776,12.827,5.8877,10.0635,1.8765,9.6456,7.1439,0.0083,0.5592,1.2726,9.9004,0.0607,11.125,0.932,6.7535,0.0466,11.7312,6.266,2.8722,0.5413,1.3012,0.0456,2.8457,6.6744,1.5655,2.8932,7.3886,0.9437,1.9663,0.9383,4.2202,2.5907,2.2571,4.5726,8.4519,6.0797,0.2861,1.4285,2.633,1.5963,3.3177,5.2553,4.4733,0.1571,0.0087,1.1263,5.7329,3.3605,5.3846,1.2996,0.5497,4.1799,6.6177,3.8683,3.389,2.923,1.3173,1.9047,2.1247,4.0491,3.6998,0.3357,3.4668,5.3078,2.7772,4.999,5.1791,1.803,3.9932,3.7206,0.2346,0.0066,2.2735,0.8903,6.3214,3.2389,0.94,5.527,2.6119,0.8091,0.9147,0.0004,1.7603,3.1867,3.6159,3.0733,5.1391,0.0296,0.1106,3.9038,1.1347,5.2265,0.5739,4.3894,1.4393,2.3762,4.8222,3.0639,4.4139,3.4131,4.155,4.3406,0.0994,1.5331,1.5141,6.1099,4.8712,4.0383,2.2005,14.1586,6.6509,8.6727,5.6649,0.3422,1.8443,2.4984,8.7422,6.8772,7.1602,2.7222,0.3587,2.6985,0.0119,3.7821,1.409,1.207,2.436,2.1431,4.2978,1.9832,4.2406,3.0759,5.1041,1.1368,4.9711,0.3735,3.7639,3.8997,2.7769,5.129,4.1152,0.0309,1.7197,4.881,5.2246,3.9274,4.6864,1.0143,2.8086,0.416,2.5434,0.5067,0.1845,3.4765,6.0327,2.8697,0.1173,5.4086,0.1712,4.8237,6.4706,0.8852,0.0002,1.831,4.4241,5.2707,3.3178,0.5965,1.5662,1.1199,1.2426,3.1436,2.9397,1.9035,5.5015,0.9847,3.9989,1.8635,0.0003,0.0267,0.5469,6.0033,0.0233,6.4125,0.0357,0.5256,3.5229,0.7922,5.3164,5.082,3.0254,2.8309,3.0049,0.5278,3.5541,2.9611,3.0914,1.8738,2.4688,2.5044,0.9996,3.4067,4.0235,1.4772,0.3347,3.4928,1.5188,1.6675,2.8378,0.6559,1.3268,1.4075,1.5921,1.6185,2.1621,0.0062,4.2433,2.771,3.9531,2.4413,1.778,0.5279,6.652,2.3546,3.0168,2.313,1.9285,5.8511,0.1407,6.0572,0.1457,2.4557,0.309,0.3284,0.0002,4.2244,4.9231,0.7368,2.7821,2.8457,0.2199,4.2677,2.5241,5.9372,3.1641,2.2046,3.2604,6.5376,1.6637,6.6825,2.8834,2.2817,1.2795,0.4913,5.3918,4.2821,2.1816,0.1298,0.0022,1.7767,0.4173,5.3361,5.2712,2.4435,5.4087,2.3164,5.9078,2.3548,0.9858,0.0002,3.5461,1.7236,0.7706,0.9155,1.5437,0.711,0.645,1.6424,3.7839,1.6748,3.6178,1.7818,2.1881,4.7889,0.2898,1.1592,1.9442,1.1765,1.5447,4.7305,2.0128,1.4735,2.5952,0.9757,2.7692,6.5085,2.5436,1.0523,6.4817,1.8935,2.7655,3.3017,2.2602,6.7294,0.275,3.1204,2.1013,1.7482,2.0151,0.0002,2.0713,0.8809,3.1721,5.3191,2.7677,7.3142,1.0384,0.2961,0.4571,7.171,0.0011,4.8786,0.4375,1.6139,1.3982,3.6482,2.7709,0.89,1.9995,5.7072,6.1906,2.3898,1.5329,4.5505,1.4611,0.6478,2.0921,1.0169,1.8107,2.4194,1.741,2.4951,1.3598,3.334,0.6411,6.0317,8.2075,0.3449,0.1021,0.8613,0.7485,0.0002,1.0029,0.0821,4.2073,0.276,2.1025,1.0367,5.2977,0.197,4.418,0.7614,2.2368,0.9384,1.7933,6.3288,5.3267,3.2857,2.8151,3.2843,2.2513,0.3202,6.1367,1.5406,5.5058,0.0017,2.0955,1.4938,2.0149,0.8543,3.6577,3.0558,2.7168,4.918,1.79,1.5708,1.1746,6.4475,2.98,6.9455,0.4869,3.2303,1.9752,0.7328,0.6033,3.4154,1.6116,0.273,0.0002,2.1581,0.1033,1.363,4.5797,0.304,1.7134,2.2903,0.4693,0.9848,1.4412,1.2194,0.0969,3.3941,3.9749,5.146,2.1366,1.238,5.2256,1.8094,5.5594,2.4974,1.6436,2.6068,1.4812,5.7115,0.7751,1.8413,3.8402,3.4159,1.9035,5.0935,0.653,0.8764,4.6292,6.431,1.2802,0.2596,5.7909,3.125,6.6173,1.9433,5.3069,8.4848,3.8085,0.1682,0.2565,0.0002,2.0699,1.7713,5.2174,0.4681,0.131,3.695,0.3332,1.6745,2.9396,12.4533,0.2088,5.6473,2.1968,3.32,5.1689,0.9447,4.1082,1.0731,5.6599,3.7992,5.5007,3.4293,2.0436,12.8229,6.0299,6.3891,0.0289,0.4552,6.1816,2.1986,5.811,1.5696,2.1743,3.4361,4.9362,1.7146,0.8226,4.6738,5.1904,0.2339,0.6908,4.4212,1.1331]}

It is home to hundreds of times the earth's gravity, and one of the highest and most dangerous temperatures in the entire known universe. And it's far from alone in its power. But when you think about it, the moon also has that unusual thing called gravity : a system which can send or receive signals from space in a variety of ways. The moon can carry heavy mass into space where gravity is not able to move it. It can also carry many small objects such as light, oil, oil, and more as well as others like carbon dioxide, radioactive substances, and the oxygen in the atmosphere of the moon. There is no doubt that the moon is a powerful object. But what else might we find to do about it?\n\n10 years ago NASA announced in its report. \"A team of scientists who plan to lead the development of the moon's lunar surface is working to identify any objects and materials that would be more likely to break, damage things or possibly cause serious damage on it. Such materials can range from debris at the surface, to a moon surface known as the Golarus, to the moon and its surface.\"","token_len":510,"entropy":[5.1858,8.6306,4.8039,2.958,1.1406,9.3477,1.816,2.1696,3.3095,8.0571,0.3503,0.5782,1.5325,1.6026,5.9705,6.1652,3.1457,1.9353,4.9459,0.037,1.1152,1.1737,2.0119,13.102,0.0311,2.6837,3.1052,4.8529,5.4343,4.217,1.2545,0.0279,0.2457,1.1642,4.4787,3.6258,2.97,2.4513,0.9059,5.406,0.1187,0.2011,4.4363,2.2544,0.8507,4.7429,1.5526,0.8843,3.941,0.3823,0.6371,0.8853,0.1483,0.956,3.4118,2.5724,3.9414,2.6486,3.6108,5.2839,2.4765,0.2637,0.7638,3.6824,4.4166,3.2152,1.8292,5.0555,0.0609,3.632,3.9307,2.9502,6.0516,6.8148,2.817,5.7708,2.0185,3.7678,5.0311,0.5991,5.697,5.1643,0.668,2.4194,2.9584,2.8901,2.633,0.1128,4.7711,2.475,1.7515,2.442,3.8635,2.1736,3.8799,1.5351,4.9598,2.0162,2.0453,4.7757,4.5743,0.9157,2.1921,2.4994,1.2091,3.3979,3.9471,1.0771,3.9876,4.9185,1.5158,2.0167,0.5912,2.3291,2.4244,1.3953,0.0566,4.2887,0.5882,1.6595,5.3877,1.5187,2.4802,2.6306,0.2491,1.8426,2.4689,1.9436,6.3264,1.2859,1.7341,4.9776,1.8624,6.1061,2.6413,1.843,1.7126,3.6983,0.2632,4.7243,4.9992,0.8092,1.0555,4.4462,3.4566,1.7963,1.2173,0.9664,3.3445,6.7208,4.9081,2.5925,8.055,0.506,3.6982,4.2398,4.3471,0.1759,5.846,3.4713,4.957,4.4053,6.287,3.6162,1.2821,1.4815,0.2997,4.1548,4.1768,0.7133,1.5486,2.0347,2.6021,4.7875,1.5887,0.0232,1.9375,5.9393,1.1004,4.9428,3.1275,0.2001,0.0146,0.532,4.7627,1.6612,3.3872,0.23,1.0407,0.3087,1.6122,3.9155,4.4345,0.2611,1.9614,5.6744,1.0985,0.5322,0.5289,1.792,4.1264,1.2109,5.3129,1.7975,1.2609,3.9676,5.9063,6.3455,2.6579,0.447,2.5191,5.5343,1.4086,1.0241,0.1401,1.8453,0.4384,3.2486,3.7552,1.8277,5.2597,1.5857,3.7105,2.3169,5.4138,5.0372,1.4179,2.3612,3.0187,3.578,2.2415,6.3149,1.6328,3.943,2.2088,0.8048,2.4263,4.9176,5.764,3.836,2.9009,3.6372,3.1133,2.123,1.1005,0.084,2.7526,0.9682,2.717,3.0954,2.2151,3.2528,2.7206,4.7473,2.8968,5.252,2.3323,4.88,1.1388,0.3124,4.5141,0.9908,2.4734,0.6272,1.1392,5.0836,0.0323,2.4166,6.0289,2.6047,5.342,3.0735,1.9762,1.5928,4.8873,2.0269,2.0901,5.382,0.592,1.804,1.6746,2.0878,0.0502,4.2876,0.0616,5.7026,2.2007,4.4864,0.0736,2.1297,1.1988,1.2175,5.2286,0.3095,0.2108,5.0191,3.4941,0.5376,3.1672,5.3264,1.3607,0.0766,2.2604,4.7914,0.3405,0.1431,2.4465,1.1893,1.1205,6.9643,1.1415,1.4971,1.2214,2.2181,2.1217,0.4796,4.5696,4.312,2.0629,1.9618,0.1706,0.5994,0.3115,1.7037,0.5549,4.7538,0.7642,6.1929,6.8312,5.6236,1.6021,2.6336,9.0787,2.9685,4.808,3.3085,3.5984,6.021,5.8881,0.6409,5.4171,1.2785,3.2732,3.7765,1.1946,4.8116,0.0016,0.7382,0.5059,2.2966,2.1722,2.5695,4.4605,5.0178,7.6109,4.5471,0.9736,4.7582,2.6807,1.5146,2.5813,3.6411,0.05,3.1729,0.9395,0.9476,1.6246,0.3091,2.7152,1.7817,5.1673,3.1341,2.1534,2.9073,0.002,4.991,1.8797,6.7757,0.6269,5.1561,2.0365,1.6277,5.0984,5.1453,1.6997,0.5511,5.8083,1.5971,4.386,0.9294,1.2023,5.8661,3.5046,0.5581,0.5823,3.6694,4.8527,1.4698,1.2955,1.1203,3.864,0.9138,1.3075,0.3783,4.2528,1.7453,2.3455,2.8885,0.2886,0.7274,0.34,1.191,1.8434,2.2682,3.6496,1.3259,1.3974,2.8727,5.9,4.0168,2.1665,2.7686,5.5919,5.3489,5.1704,0.2645,0.1553,2.9892,0.2288,6.1226,5.4085,0.3168,4.7759,2.8297,4.6224,2.3035,3.2357,5.6985,2.5474,3.838,4.316,0.3147,1.468,5.4867,5.8511,0.2489,5.7042,1.0987,3.7184,0.0887,2.6531,3.2523,0.6111,4.8251,2.0905,5.339,2.3878,1.367,4.1498,6.0119,4.4416,3.022,3.3233,0.6819,3.7084,1.1829,4.1642,1.3269,0.0497,5.1342,3.5996,2.5782,10.3912,2.219,5.4896,2.8357,3.174,0.784,4.9557,5.591,1.4128,4.3144,2.376,4.3467,4.3809,0.2367,6.1861,6.1965,0.6976,0.9186,1.7051,1.0852,4.0587,5.116,2.9742,6.4216,0.3385,1.5445,4.8593,7.8945,5.248,3.0235,1.2579,2.6628,2.1086,5.0013,0.8966,4.5204,3.2935]}

But I have to admit, I've also given up on him... he really does suck and gets so lonely... it just feels so good to be back and to be in his company again. All the best!\nOh God me and my friends got to know each other, we do actually have many things in common... (i mean, it's okay. If it didn't bother you at all, you wouldn't know :P and we definitely aren't dating.).. I think I just need to be really sweet... I don't know maybe it will just happen but at the very least I'll be sure to not be jealous of her or something...\nThat would be fantastic ;P I actually believe you would have a good time with your friends who are totally into it but it'd also be fun if you managed to find the perfect person lol  If we ever came close to getting married I would like to marry my best friend. We definitely will need time together... And maybe we should try to have a more romantic friendship.\nOh yes... and my best friend is so funny and I hope she will come in the next few months to see what we are up to...  We are definitely not dating, and yeah, I will tell you he is really weird and really lonely and I'm probably going to just let him know.  I hope to have some friends in the next 6 months and a good friend by the end of it :\/","token_len":510,"entropy":[6.8193,2.2606,1.9953,7.9811,1.3472,3.6658,10.9072,9.3848,4.2263,4.8167,6.4345,4.3717,4.5786,0.8243,2.7045,2.6767,3.072,4.583,1.017,3.9864,0.0096,1.5815,6.1167,1.5268,2.4007,6.5962,3.234,4.8134,5.8628,1.604,1.5037,4.996,0.6675,2.2941,0.5567,1.6516,3.6736,1.8875,6.6695,5.4724,2.0679,6.3825,3.357,0.0009,1.0637,2.759,2.9476,0.5841,4.1525,6.2558,2.1269,6.4737,3.57,2.0276,2.2312,0.3303,6.4274,5.5623,0.7793,2.0619,1.8461,5.3814,0.4925,3.8528,4.3646,4.0827,2.0133,1.3569,2.7903,2.3977,2.882,2.7561,1.2593,2.5113,2.9525,2.6093,2.3611,1.2033,3.3707,5.2599,7.7138,4.6691,1.6215,0.3139,4.7504,1.2646,1.5745,5.7754,5.0836,0.3097,3.4532,0.9129,2.14,4.4809,5.784,0.1127,1.1659,4.8431,7.8447,3.067,2.4099,4.8289,2.2001,4.8091,0.0009,5.257,1.3423,2.0407,3.0102,2.957,4.4417,3.516,3.184,4.8651,0.1908,0.8456,3.5262,0.2847,4.1487,4.1881,5.8534,1.0659,3.1718,0.3926,5.5228,3.6202,2.3176,1.6618,0.7836,5.0911,1.6722,3.7434,6.4723,0.4673,1.3306,5.3911,4.9079,0.7777,5.3281,0.5303,4.2735,5.8974,1.2496,0.0967,3.5652,1.9575,5.0539,3.603,0.0115,5.4078,1.5792,2.2392,8.1239,7.4807,4.7714,1.8406,4.4001,1.3767,2.4257,0.1222,6.2317,2.6528,5.1243,3.4944,6.7834,9.7435,4.5916,5.0899,3.4,1.3929,2.2378,2.5549,4.8696,2.2463,3.5343,6.4604,1.8508,1.0808,1.2374,3.9619,1.6144,2.5406,2.2581,2.8794,4.9098,5.4418,5.9488,2.8764,1.2041,5.4427,3.2608,1.1078,4.0238,0.8054,5.8453,1.8616,2.1613,4.3356,2.2684,0.0009,1.1796,4.175,5.0493,1.6365,5.2289,2.3335,6.0736,1.1411,3.4373,2.414,5.125,5.4321,0.7914,0.5835,1.1021,4.2851,1.772,2.8557,1.412,1.1616,0.8342,1.2192,3.5932,4.8048,5.8704,1.144,0.7811,0.7439,3.377,2.3167,3.5408,2.8201,5.2432,2.2696,5.7331,3.265,4.3021,3.1494,4.0434,3.8162,2.883,1.703,2.8085,0.8453,1.4191,2.9612,3.3055,3.5018,1.0668,2.9563,1.716,3.6831,1.342,0.6722,6.0056,2.068,2.8137,2.853,0.773,4.7103,5.1301,7.5738,3.4192,0.9056,2.5715,5.6486,2.9595,3.5126,0.9089,0.029,3.5086,2.1818,5.9243,6.8031,1.4424,4.9062,3.0975,1.2523,0.0061,2.0319,6.0415,5.1943,3.0017,0.8739,3.1045,0.6474,5.1401,4.2324,4.6405,2.8271,4.2677,0.0005,4.3372,0.2916,3.6859,0.4699,0.7831,1.8675,3.0985,0.0016,2.3293,10.1326,1.3986,5.6751,3.1097,4.7565,5.3026,0.0004,3.3573,3.51,8.4773,2.7414,2.5269,2.0491,3.8918,3.5778,0.3034,3.1369,4.7095,7.3353,3.4833,2.0723,2.7283,0.0011,0.7599,7.4768,2.6674,2.6655,3.8398,4.0992,2.4875,4.1498,0.766,2.5972,0.0315,1.6135,3.1611,1.3832,4.8987,0.2077,5.5118,2.3206,4.9566,1.3906,4.2407,2.7234,4.6982,2.1718,1.7951,5.0013,4.538,0.3298,5.9239,8.4666,2.4014,3.3083,5.2423,5.6491,3.3221,2.8983,2.8741,1.9802,2.5535,0.4754,1.3821,2.7437,2.6308,5.3623,1.149,4.8242,4.7548,3.2528,3.0406,3.099,4.8995,2.9659,0.3415,3.4898,2.7594,0.9799,6.9425,0.0283,3.0114,4.1871,2.8337,2.6435,8.8554,5.372,8.1081,4.3613,3.8869,6.9227,4.4121,0.796,2.5328,2.1775,2.8887,1.3738,4.1018,0.1786,5.2352,3.1727,1.3735,0.1233,2.4469,3.0937,4.6746,3.3315,6.1619,5.0085,2.142,3.2338,5.7736,4.1953,1.9436,3.1245,2.9694,1.1117,2.2509,0.7261,5.7124,2.2527,6.8438,1.932,1.3897,3.6357,4.0622,3.2981,3.3533,3.6895,2.1286,0.1879,1.3525,4.5252,4.7461,1.7366,3.02,4.5374,1.4475,2.8436,4.1622,4.5715,3.6615,1.0213,2.0752,1.079,1.7319,2.0541,4.1746,2.4552,2.146,1.3471,0.0576,2.5811,4.2853,5.6252,2.1579,3.5055,2.9738,2.1231,2.5697,3.2031,7.6071,0.6305,1.1942,3.8331,4.0005,0.2897,5.5294,0.859,3.4039,3.4313,1.3575,4.2562,3.9942,2.021,1.4914,2.7499,4.8564,1.269,0.0227,4.6554,3.7282,0.5639,3.6966,2.801,3.0507,1.749,2.9441,3.2666,2.2545,2.2448,4.1007,2.771,0.5901,2.0354,4.6107,0.291,2.2723,4.9134,2.9327,3.5081,4.9264,0.9551,0.8263,0.1312,2.7316,5.6592,5.0583]}

One day, a man in a crowd reaches to a stranger and whispers, `` You're it. ''\n\nIn a twist, the ban is only effective in cases when there are no known cases of crime committed by the man, but not against the suspect.\n\nBut, if the man is caught in the act, police will be forced to issue a red notice and impose new punishments.\n\n\"It makes sense to ban all such incidents only if there is an organised crime network involved but the law only forbids the provision of death sentence to convicted criminals who committed crimes as to them. Let 'll make it as simple as possible to provide the man with a chance to prove his innocence,\" said Nalini Chandra, a member of police in Pune.\n\nThe ban against Tag has been effective only in cases where there are no known cases of crime committed by the man, but not against the suspect.\n\nLast year, police issued a notice demanding that Tag, a resident of Ghatkopar, be interrogated without a warrant and that his face be displayed in public, but he has been refused.\n\nIn his defence, Chandra said that Tag is living outside the state, although the police have not told him that he has a permit to travel to the country. He said that last year, when Tag was asked to register in the Indian passport office to return to the state, both Tag's parents and Nalini had told them that the man had no permit to travel to the country.\n\n''\"When we found out that this was not the case, but it was also made public so that it was brought to the attention of law enforcement. I think (the man) would have no criminal record against him,'' Nalini said.\n\nAccording to officials, it now appears that a case is pending.\n\n\"We will continue to ask the police whether they can conduct an inquiry against him. So far, no case has been registered against him.''\n\nEarlier, on Tuesday, police arrested a 32-year-old man from Rajasthan, and took him into custody for alleged crimes like kidnapping. This came after Sita Srinivas Das and Sohail, both 24, were found to be at loggerheads with police and were charged with kidnapping for ransom, rape of a minor and other kinds of crime.","token_len":516,"entropy":[6.5616,1.7177,5.9762,12.759,7.0188,6.6978,4.0358,2.9876,3.0119,3.7702,2.512,2.2209,7.4633,11.4236,3.7686,2.9909,6.825,1.3618,4.254,1.1901,8.0606,9.498,1.7694,8.7662,1.6658,4.9328,2.0005,0.0027,1.9654,3.6483,1.2501,1.3316,0.4741,0.1617,0.2255,0.0013,0.0013,0.01,0.0048,0.0038,0.0023,0.0017,0.0117,0.0009,0.0024,0.0,0.0005,0.0005,0.0025,0.0271,0.096,0.0012,0.0031,0.0009,0.1663,4.6805,0.0002,3.388,2.4899,5.8514,1.0182,1.1808,5.1495,1.9367,3.5164,2.7432,2.1058,2.5042,2.5945,2.3997,1.5607,1.2965,3.3164,3.374,0.4374,5.4443,2.8187,0.9495,1.9442,4.0854,2.4335,2.8324,3.3077,5.1151,0.9575,4.2094,0.3373,0.7,0.0003,4.0473,4.0869,3.5123,1.1665,1.5296,1.0018,3.1352,2.7376,1.2863,0.4271,0.6419,3.6829,1.6637,2.4358,3.1189,0.0176,3.9464,0.7225,5.669,3.283,2.6319,6.1109,5.7865,3.9935,0.8305,0.437,0.0003,3.2852,2.1551,4.6191,2.1291,1.2203,4.3793,3.8854,3.9737,3.216,4.9616,1.0222,1.2109,0.6669,2.7959,5.7166,0.7029,4.8452,2.5239,5.8627,3.1144,3.1886,4.2009,5.6948,1.979,5.3655,0.0737,6.8898,3.1376,2.3859,4.9754,0.6011,3.2123,4.1578,1.5755,4.7315,7.7119,5.7989,3.491,7.4589,6.2651,10.5444,4.019,1.707,4.3118,1.6175,0.0477,0.3901,2.3978,5.3399,2.1931,5.0932,0.2637,1.0669,3.0244,0.5625,2.9065,0.6524,0.0974,1.0379,0.9174,4.8528,4.6804,1.8628,6.887,0.4877,1.616,4.5741,0.0052,5.8459,2.9992,4.5795,0.4384,0.5521,0.2325,0.0003,1.7254,2.0409,5.2885,0.8449,2.2732,0.7786,5.3292,3.4286,0.5623,0.4498,0.5667,0.8429,1.0032,0.1351,0.0735,0.3509,0.0636,0.1154,0.0716,0.0191,0.0642,0.4073,0.4187,0.1379,0.1067,0.0072,0.0098,0.0034,0.1232,0.7011,0.0004,5.2107,0.9246,0.109,3.0373,3.749,0.861,2.8392,6.013,1.0616,1.9328,3.1586,2.3297,5.3138,0.0746,4.3335,2.5394,0.6728,0.2583,0.4404,1.0137,1.6669,7.7965,5.873,2.9642,1.3189,2.1192,4.081,2.9353,5.4317,0.7,5.3425,1.5151,1.8277,3.094,3.2866,2.5803,2.4621,2.5321,2.0933,0.8828,0.3476,0.0004,2.7332,3.9221,4.7337,0.1275,2.5478,0.2676,1.8931,2.3391,2.1078,6.2069,5.5841,0.9361,2.6964,2.0627,5.6511,2.4058,1.9688,1.5608,2.1866,3.8418,0.0938,1.5207,1.3919,1.7914,2.1091,2.6668,0.9265,2.4837,1.4135,1.7269,1.8577,0.5042,2.933,1.1412,0.9369,7.2144,0.6712,0.5416,2.1429,3.4655,0.5806,4.8553,0.8924,3.8261,3.2949,1.094,4.3707,3.6899,1.9714,3.5559,4.6722,0.3541,1.9697,2.1438,0.3666,7.7075,4.4683,2.8234,1.097,2.1421,5.811,0.2696,0.0022,2.3803,2.9641,2.5244,0.6147,2.2766,3.5964,1.5132,2.5772,1.4578,1.0749,0.7106,1.2093,0.9263,0.4135,0.2923,0.2291,0.0002,6.1394,8.6552,3.5208,1.832,4.0529,0.1375,0.7935,3.7426,1.5661,1.8464,1.4243,0.0152,0.2555,5.7006,3.7346,0.6076,5.2894,5.3639,1.7144,5.0996,0.4669,3.42,1.9001,4.9312,0.7384,0.9384,0.4717,0.009,3.7672,0.5063,3.7709,3.3211,2.5114,6.073,1.439,2.4466,0.1771,3.1056,1.0884,4.465,5.8605,0.2316,5.3118,1.3908,2.3621,3.8625,0.004,0.0024,0.5049,0.0536,0.3953,0.0002,4.203,0.0048,4.9414,0.3628,3.8814,6.6538,1.1866,0.2463,3.6834,2.8197,2.3895,3.0566,3.1259,0.9086,0.0003,2.1154,1.8727,2.7413,3.3926,0.3349,4.457,0.9938,2.7073,3.3112,2.2617,2.4424,4.8751,2.3176,2.1967,4.4795,2.3615,1.3565,5.9263,0.3529,0.5815,2.0546,2.3973,0.1322,0.1617,1.0155,1.281,0.3473,4.7281,0.7546,0.0003,5.1273,0.8475,4.2269,2.7358,0.0721,2.7257,2.59,1.5284,6.1163,0.0124,0.0028,0.0152,0.0006,0.7648,2.229,4.6061,0.6979,0.0018,1.8004,3.5815,4.8765,0.113,1.7235,0.0396,1.6633,4.3314,4.1634,5.3323,3.8061,1.9758,5.959,3.9332,0.9635,7.4817,4.3632,4.6487,1.9893,0.013,12.6567,3.5973,4.0939,5.0424,0.8593,5.9512,2.3303,5.8603,0.151,0.705,2.427,2.9057,1.1432,4.3085,5.9821,0.0309,1.1094,2.2139,3.187,3.341,2.9611,0.395,1.8134,3.8969,4.5888,2.8488,4.2431,4.1067,0.5103,1.4998,0.4548,3.5167,6.261,0.0152,2.5455,0.245]}

She has always believed she could live on and on, and was blessed with one of the best and only cookbooks her family could afford.\n\nIn 2010, Ana Maria became one of the most talked about authors of her country as she opened her own wine wine restaurant, La Croix Wine & Beer, at a historic vineyard in Pomerania.\n\nThe site was first revealed by her father in 1999.\n\nThe book is available in stores or online through a website which has a list of available titles. The book has been selected to appear on books with a collection of 25 titles, or in some series of books, some with titles that have already been published. All the titles listed have been picked to appear on books where they exist.\n\nA vampire who owns her home in Italy struggles to stay away from garlic, the sunlight, and holy objects on a daily basis.\n\nThe books she has chosen include Vampire Woman who owned a home in Naples, Vampire King, Vampire Queen and Vampire Lord.\n\nShe also owns a number of small homes, both for the locals and foreigners.\n\nIn her view, the beauty of Italian culture lies in the fact that Italians love to share their culture.\n\nThe author states \u201cIt is easy to find Italians who are curious about their culture, and who are not. If they choose to learn Italian, then they can look forward to the great times they will have with relatives, friends and colleagues who share the Italian values.\u201d\n\nTo be honest, she doesn\u2019t even need to look up local culture to find the same. In fact, she knows who to talk to about Italian history.\n\nThe author is a social justice activist, and so is her protagonist and best friend. She loves the idea of an Italian culture. This is a very important piece of inspiration for Ana Maria, and a piece of insight that will help her overcome her doubts about her own nationality after years of being persecuted, forced to live a life of luxury in Italy.","token_len":517,"entropy":[11.6207,6.116,7.1083,1.1559,4.44,1.3146,7.8763,3.6963,11.0741,0.4239,3.2776,7.1015,0.132,11.2629,2.0954,4.4091,11.1069,2.7435,0.5523,8.555,8.053,5.1561,2.7688,3.6927,0.0088,0.643,1.8067,0.0035,2.4874,4.8103,1.5838,2.0789,3.628,0.0239,6.4753,3.1216,1.7553,3.9751,0.2363,0.9134,3.0282,0.7456,4.5524,0.5911,5.4121,1.6232,5.0358,3.5928,1.7587,2.411,5.5125,0.6941,6.2938,4.1266,0.5695,3.6959,6.9678,1.8652,3.7472,2.2511,4.9884,2.752,4.1095,7.3467,4.5289,3.8857,2.3092,1.8841,0.0283,1.4652,0.1642,6.8984,2.2698,2.5149,0.6575,6.1636,0.0703,0.0692,5.0975,1.0438,0.0003,5.7196,6.2262,3.8942,4.6647,6.6478,2.4494,3.6641,3.0865,4.7519,1.7649,0.577,2.9444,1.8988,3.8497,1.9357,1.6682,0.2239,3.3162,0.8545,0.0064,0.8031,1.4344,2.0513,4.1222,4.8458,3.0188,1.7823,2.0889,2.8544,4.9941,3.4419,1.791,2.1942,4.8178,5.6325,0.5081,5.0787,0.4885,0.1901,2.0898,4.7013,5.3908,7.202,0.5993,5.8703,0.9985,1.5105,2.2201,0.4361,0.5587,0.0003,3.2115,4.1445,0.3453,3.57,1.8076,4.441,3.0765,0.0459,0.5268,2.5129,5.1878,0.2285,3.1894,1.2415,0.984,5.8375,5.4599,0.6975,4.6613,1.378,2.0011,6.7029,7.1153,3.9552,1.6867,3.86,5.7989,0.2657,6.661,2.4041,4.1597,1.0974,3.4372,2.5946,4.1202,7.7065,0.0333,0.798,4.7409,6.381,0.23,0.7715,0.6585,0.0002,2.4192,6.6854,2.0753,4.9149,5.7325,1.9155,3.955,2.6998,2.1982,5.3055,1.7899,1.3883,0.0002,2.3398,2.4482,1.6332,3.4906,1.5649,5.7916,5.499,1.0701,2.988,3.391,2.8824,4.4313,2.5397,2.7121,4.1085,0.0955,3.8515,2.4931,0.8887,2.9963,2.0769,2.1404,1.2221,4.9864,2.4758,4.0003,1.0453,6.6016,6.7591,1.8262,6.7527,0.734,2.4011,0.9538,1.6593,4.1813,2.9383,3.3633,10.6801,2.1624,2.8461,1.5582,4.3785,2.7142,3.2207,1.9075,1.6599,2.9067,0.2504,0.8013,0.4345,5.7491,1.9245,0.8106,3.2481,2.5461,0.6106,4.5928,2.3092,1.2798,0.6353,2.5544,5.2745,2.1176,5.4856,0.9648,0.3578,0.0003,2.9883,2.875,1.028,0.5238,5.9583,1.8498,0.8137,0.3061,6.9598,0.0182,0.0202,0.0014,0.004,0.0092,0.0725,0.0037,0.0636,0.0147,0.001,0.0125,0.0153,0.0123,0.0023,0.0031,0.0003,0.1275,0.353,0.0002,1.0293,3.6904,5.2775,1.5749,3.7587,3.4254,8.0805,6.7266,4.4592,3.8032,0.5339,0.4105,0.1349,4.107,1.5892,3.293,5.3683,1.8667,1.1744,1.8586,2.432,1.0398,3.903,1.36,0.5555,0.0002,2.3294,1.6213,1.675,0.7523,5.1058,0.0032,3.9619,3.4129,1.9617,5.62,3.4771,2.7052,7.7048,0.3067,2.7844,0.9691,0.4746,0.0002,2.8315,2.9883,5.5495,0.1911,1.5299,6.2808,0.3401,2.8477,1.803,5.0507,0.1657,0.884,2.1868,0.0754,4.5583,2.0634,1.4341,3.2479,0.9013,2.0854,2.0482,0.3603,0.0002,2.7882,2.8435,5.8762,13.685,7.5026,5.4593,0.8219,4.3048,0.3307,3.5569,6.4656,1.036,1.745,5.3771,0.3433,2.0685,1.1191,1.3821,1.7048,1.9143,1.6364,3.2719,5.5136,4.6565,2.1376,5.3724,0.4054,3.4327,1.804,0.4332,2.7408,0.8451,2.2542,5.818,2.2928,0.0354,2.248,5.183,4.5902,2.1073,1.0671,1.1258,2.0989,7.7937,1.5564,0.3505,0.6813,3.0569,2.6122,3.582,2.4803,4.2839,4.7792,1.6912,5.7739,6.9914,0.6439,0.0002,4.8572,3.8995,3.3753,0.1272,3.9291,2.7531,11.1855,8.8795,0.2205,4.4041,4.2303,0.3311,3.3687,2.6654,7.5991,2.3177,1.0153,1.7666,2.2006,3.6663,2.1508,4.1091,0.3788,0.0778,0.8549,3.3135,5.0832,2.1375,2.1885,0.0521,2.4852,2.7639,4.6644,1.2756,0.4183,0.0002,2.3153,1.5362,2.7425,1.9175,5.6815,3.3876,0.7041,1.4084,1.9804,6.172,3.2498,1.676,7.528,4.5031,5.2081,0.0684,1.8368,2.3169,4.2999,2.6272,2.6697,0.1662,4.6565,0.7643,2.5977,3.013,4.968,0.9327,2.4655,3.1833,1.9062,5.0396,0.2474,5.2612,0.8494,2.2594,0.3236,2.032,1.7157,2.982,4.4642,0.5528,5.8637,1.7893,1.8681,1.6563,0.785,3.6847,0.9941,4.0848,1.2404,1.5304,1.1393,4.9722,7.0048,4.0903,0.2231,2.601,5.2653,3.4841,3.9606,0.5259,1.3697,3.6918,0.3756,0.6839,0.6505,1.6634,0.909,0.2488]}

It can be really hard to remember it all.\n\nYou also know that there are many tones you are always thinking of but can't remember. You've heard it, but you are unable to find it anymore. It is that weird feeling where something is all you can think or do and only you have the same idea. It can be really powerful and haunting. You've been playing this song for so long that the only thing you could do is to not really think of it. You are constantly thinking about it. If it didn't sound strange at all, you wouldn't know it's a melody... It is just a haunting feeling. I just can't think of many of the other voices that sound similar but just like the melody. There are so many different variations between a melody and a sound. And even though these melodies are the same song the sound is always the same.\n\nYour friend is right, you only keep hearing it in your head. So many songs have different melodies. But you have heard all the sounds. But can't remember. When you hear different melodies you can't understand what they are or how they are all different. But you know that there is no need to worry. You know what is really so important to remember. Don't forget to practice!\n\nSo as you can imagine, if you're thinking of it, you're probably thinking too much. Maybe you would even think it too much. But you must remember the melodies just like you would think about their lyrics. It is just a song and the melody can't change. So you have to remember it sometimes. And it can be scary.","token_len":517,"entropy":[7.1948,1.6422,2.8369,2.0457,5.5908,4.1747,6.0326,5.9819,4.1282,1.2393,0.5258,0.266,1.0594,2.146,2.5692,2.7982,1.2679,1.0621,5.9912,0.8805,1.957,1.754,7.3766,0.5513,6.762,6.3858,0.6907,4.9608,0.4048,0.2034,0.421,5.8483,0.9894,1.2624,1.0313,4.4951,3.9233,1.1765,4.1321,10.5866,0.0086,5.3037,2.1529,1.8365,1.7099,4.3622,6.9441,2.1407,4.0001,2.5387,3.9598,2.5937,4.6085,0.516,0.3289,1.0775,3.7442,3.4343,0.4535,6.5027,1.254,3.7288,1.582,0.5623,2.3186,0.602,2.796,3.6959,0.9896,4.3449,0.6617,5.5169,1.2273,1.5908,0.5773,2.3688,1.3446,0.7069,1.7328,0.7898,3.7008,1.6989,3.8141,0.0006,5.0628,1.4791,0.3203,0.0711,0.0367,1.7613,0.5315,5.21,4.2277,7.4471,5.4129,0.0352,1.3537,5.0712,3.8771,1.1017,2.3924,2.442,4.9873,0.458,1.2358,0.0209,1.4821,4.0248,1.6815,1.3752,5.4066,1.4999,3.0156,3.4421,2.1836,1.5861,0.6003,2.5933,2.1253,0.7012,4.1747,4.5098,1.3031,1.9285,4.5897,6.2179,0.0716,0.541,0.7289,4.1964,1.9068,5.5553,4.6219,4.0772,5.215,0.3505,2.6721,4.556,0.9457,1.7052,2.8994,1.3858,5.3624,4.4127,1.3376,2.1502,4.7334,0.7798,4.3115,4.1423,3.8792,6.8041,3.6122,2.913,4.4495,4.7375,2.0698,6.5083,4.7393,5.2006,2.9442,2.6311,0.0424,3.3203,4.1016,1.8871,0.5624,4.9377,4.0615,3.3253,0.3206,0.2523,3.8251,5.7166,5.3656,3.6522,0.2246,6.3381,0.65,1.1226,4.4608,0.4711,0.508,2.5762,3.2426,1.084,4.7016,1.7635,0.5326,1.2547,1.9493,2.3694,1.3818,2.3953,0.0002,3.2235,4.551,3.1652,1.1219,2.7925,0.6487,2.537,7.6363,3.1974,4.1727,5.3038,3.6015,1.1239,4.0917,3.5679,0.1462,0.8222,0.8282,2.1947,3.6035,2.0672,1.605,4.1267,1.9354,1.3226,4.2161,4.4544,0.0059,4.0636,0.9999,4.949,0.2209,2.4752,1.9932,5.4369,6.0258,1.055,4.1755,4.0658,1.7398,4.2329,1.3701,1.2408,0.6255,4.9714,2.287,2.8647,5.2928,0.6858,3.7851,1.3476,3.643,3.0415,1.1314,2.0127,2.6791,0.7018,2.2955,5.3315,1.8998,6.8531,0.8913,2.3099,3.4385,2.7893,4.4817,2.4444,2.0947,0.7472,2.4878,0.1093,1.1225,3.7864,1.9959,1.0356,0.3658,3.8447,1.6801,2.1335,1.7988,4.6893,4.8845,1.2161,1.5509,0.1084,0.9801,1.7474,2.535,3.5014,2.0784,0.9583,0.6982,1.5249,4.1543,2.6283,3.9494,0.0005,3.873,4.2241,3.0465,0.8369,0.5188,1.1802,1.6938,0.0007,2.2143,1.2493,5.637,2.8191,2.1425,6.8488,3.2894,1.8145,3.3403,1.7327,6.1226,1.7506,0.8207,4.1169,4.3765,2.3547,0.0011,2.098,0.1125,6.6542,4.5224,0.7371,2.3646,4.9209,1.6475,3.9282,3.2985,3.8131,4.0699,2.8794,1.4697,2.4389,0.5269,3.5487,0.5592,1.4349,0.0095,1.4481,4.9029,6.209,5.5023,0.7172,0.3176,0.5803,3.8257,0.7797,4.5133,3.7029,1.1213,4.4965,3.3159,0.7839,4.174,0.3936,5.6413,5.1491,3.6407,1.1581,3.1286,1.068,0.0043,0.5122,1.393,0.0002,4.4277,6.0163,2.9896,4.7361,1.4075,2.2168,5.4718,6.9794,1.2837,1.6682,3.7471,1.0599,0.1098,1.2293,4.2801,4.0171,5.1392,2.2531,3.038,1.5244,1.5874,2.6087,1.9481,2.736,2.4433,3.1731,1.3361,3.5888,2.5379,4.4391,5.4148,1.5018,1.2231,3.1214,4.5422,0.5101,1.5136,5.1072,1.5017,1.7002,1.8318,0.6234,4.3166,1.6766,1.0464,0.8519,3.2091,1.9269,0.2263,2.074,4.2235,1.4138,0.4304,3.4768,1.5864,2.5138,1.1199,1.6922,1.3353,2.6622,3.9743,0.1574,4.0005,1.798,1.418,2.4582,3.1117,2.8633,3.1176,6.0808,1.92,1.3824,4.2816,1.4433,5.4976,0.0005,2.8754,2.3918,3.8617,3.1425,0.7708,0.0003,3.8652,5.3097,0.7953,2.7635,2.2934,0.3501,4.1897,0.2423,3.6329,4.8174,0.7879,4.526,1.8654,1.0498,2.0798,3.306,0.7768,3.7798,0.2679,0.5385,4.2181,0.4729,6.0401,4.7836,1.9201,2.3107,3.0664,0.6677,0.7956,1.3497,1.7298,4.5995,2.0416,3.1982,3.7822,4.3349,2.2418,1.0371,1.6263,2.0329,2.1213,5.1601,4.3931,0.4841,2.9693,1.7945,2.8653,1.7804,3.6638,2.7981,3.4803,1.3009,3.8612,1.7382,1.841,0.632,3.1778,1.8835,2.1343,0.1403,2.9089,1.4265,7.4008,0.8541,2.8683,2.5198,2.7023,0.8623,4.3959,1.1461]}

{"id":3402,"ended":false,"length":502,"text":"Tell a story in an unconventional way with the ending before the beginning, that maybe, if you want to have an impact in a certain space around the protagonist, the ending might be appropriate, while the ending might not.\n\nWhat's up with me wanting an ending? Well, let's get on with it!\n\nI'm going to start with the ending. First of all, if you're going to tell stories in an unconventional way with the ending before the beginning, and use it in an unusual way, try telling a story in an unconventional way only if you like the ending!\n\nI know that I've probably done it differently in a lot of previous work, as I'm usually really good at making things seem ordinary and predictable at first. As we've progressed further, I've gone back to using that more, but I don't know if that is working for you. It takes some time to really really come out with an end in mind, I think you may find that sometimes you're just a bit bored by what you've been saying for a longer time and it feels like the end is in sight, but unfortunately it isn't!\n\nAnyway, this is a short, but quite interesting story where the protagonist is getting his revenge on their father, and his mother is at home, and the story is based off of those themes. In both cases, the ending of this story has an almost immediate, but also almost ambiguous meaning. If you prefer that, I'm going to go ahead and use the end in between a few words.\n\nHow about this one! If you're already interested in trying these stories, take a look at my previous posts on this topic, and then send me a link so that I can put the end down on your list. I think I'll put about 20-29 pages into my story with that ending in mind!\n\nAnother suggestion:\n\nDo you have a favorite movie? If so, please share it below, please. I'd love to hear about it!\n\nDo you have something you like about playing games? If so, please share it below, and please. I'd love to hear about it!\n\nWhat's up with us? We're an underground rock band that specializes in rock and metal, but at the same time we're also pretty adventurous! We're also incredibly lucky to be able to release music videos for games that are now released in a variety of languages worldwide, so if you'd like to get in on the fun, just share it with your loved ones!","token_len":522,"entropy":[4.1301,3.573,4.6773,6.5793,8.5049,0.5375,4.3464,2.5137,9.3002,7.8493,2.3391,4.4043,2.6002,4.5034,6.1219,5.2558,2.9559,0.9627,3.6347,0.491,3.9728,2.9974,3.4466,2.9799,2.1991,4.0544,6.0987,7.4962,1.5264,7.1626,0.3462,3.6227,1.6545,2.7362,1.0162,4.9542,2.7802,5.527,2.0599,2.2254,0.7513,1.0843,0.8793,1.2071,0.0132,4.1451,2.2947,4.788,0.2255,6.9023,7.098,4.718,0.6743,2.3146,3.1504,0.1881,4.1645,0.3793,3.5692,3.9662,0.2326,1.1847,2.7881,0.7613,0.0002,2.6654,1.811,2.6573,0.0466,2.2013,0.8482,1.1173,2.7032,1.5366,4.9792,1.5188,0.0031,0.0706,3.6477,0.5953,1.5388,2.3982,0.0461,3.238,5.0957,1.7828,1.5571,0.188,0.0771,1.6239,0.1743,0.0517,0.158,0.0133,0.0061,0.0556,5.1067,6.1303,2.007,2.4341,2.4066,3.7961,0.0776,0.4245,6.5537,3.8169,2.0155,0.1922,1.0661,0.6705,0.5533,0.053,6.3224,2.3849,0.7159,3.9761,1.5043,0.8352,3.7643,1.2396,0.0002,2.5283,3.1735,2.0174,2.3465,2.3766,5.1679,3.37,2.0987,5.7224,2.3756,3.1697,3.1109,0.0084,4.6316,4.639,0.672,5.2149,1.1837,2.3843,3.9943,5.034,2.0794,0.1231,3.5038,2.6286,3.1899,6.6486,1.8697,4.7992,4.7189,3.1332,0.9964,4.8399,4.6986,1.7901,4.2935,4.021,1.5431,0.9641,0.6413,5.4971,2.0718,1.5046,3.2084,3.8521,4.1701,3.5081,2.3697,1.1315,3.3602,0.0005,2.9853,0.7882,1.8703,3.7505,5.306,1.9408,1.1802,0.9277,3.4285,5.6184,2.2468,1.804,0.8059,3.2947,5.2993,4.6641,4.2196,3.3651,2.7517,3.24,3.769,3.6687,0.8781,4.6042,1.3529,3.3429,4.1811,1.5698,1.2601,4.7944,1.814,2.7236,1.8124,4.3443,1.5789,5.0916,3.4784,2.4707,0.5227,1.0198,2.1381,4.8935,3.7359,0.8495,6.0248,0.539,3.025,3.1946,3.2607,0.7944,3.0644,1.7168,0.888,3.5094,2.2276,1.7117,1.407,7.1132,2.3422,3.2979,0.0004,3.4097,0.7034,0.0002,4.8299,0.1143,3.5545,0.6991,2.1959,4.2354,2.9846,2.8871,4.9976,1.947,2.1163,3.9261,1.6364,0.5721,1.6749,6.051,3.3437,2.6799,0.5275,5.4391,2.234,1.6445,1.519,2.898,3.1504,1.7715,5.1219,3.403,2.0652,1.6326,2.1558,2.6965,1.7266,5.0615,2.1251,0.6755,5.0738,5.8234,0.7951,3.6399,5.647,1.2098,0.4062,1.1702,2.3127,4.0221,3.0541,0.3181,3.4125,3.7165,4.0818,6.3616,2.4506,3.7298,3.6756,4.8982,7.0825,3.1647,0.8211,3.8231,0.5723,6.5986,3.8255,1.7661,2.2719,2.6785,1.6192,0.0112,2.8513,1.1331,0.0542,2.733,1.5436,3.4989,3.2323,8.1512,5.0726,2.1567,3.3517,1.2493,0.4969,0.0002,5.1107,2.4831,3.0473,2.204,4.5065,3.801,0.2874,1.1921,4.553,3.997,0.1249,4.6223,4.3692,2.8268,1.1955,5.1452,0.2306,0.2056,0.1983,1.551,2.4357,2.536,1.4586,3.1635,0.5597,1.6693,1.5291,2.9259,6.0573,0.3735,1.0481,3.5498,3.6352,2.0952,0.1894,0.1403,4.83,2.8634,3.4502,5.4761,3.5711,3.5206,2.2822,1.0722,2.1336,3.6866,2.2029,1.9892,4.0189,7.0757,2.7328,2.5946,6.0919,1.6957,1.2437,2.3382,4.1929,5.2543,3.3127,2.3257,2.5363,0.4668,2.396,0.476,0.0002,5.6965,5.5674,2.8996,4.0054,0.0001,4.4359,0.9895,1.6291,1.513,1.3975,6.3099,2.3829,2.3457,0.2542,0.0438,1.9858,2.0894,0.5426,3.4865,2.3274,4.6058,2.9454,1.972,1.942,0.2837,0.1246,0.4656,1.4863,0.3112,0.8779,0.7584,0.0003,4.8046,0.0331,0.8484,3.7863,1.4342,3.8994,1.0832,6.0588,3.5049,0.8151,1.3491,0.1318,0.0151,0.3962,0.8034,0.2166,0.2663,1.0091,2.6324,3.6156,1.6614,0.1539,0.0898,0.0079,0.0013,0.037,0.0036,0.0048,0.0061,0.3706,0.0001,3.3331,1.556,2.1792,0.6345,5.9028,1.3339,2.7976,0.9084,5.7704,7.2116,6.0488,0.2884,2.1447,4.8928,0.0062,3.9229,1.959,1.8093,1.5344,2.7945,5.3895,0.3137,0.3525,0.0006,1.4305,1.3562,1.9212,3.6562,6.1217,3.3643,1.0839,1.6261,2.5415,5.5368,4.7543,0.9049,1.5263,1.9371,0.0059,5.1123,2.5963,5.0279,2.6105,3.9706,2.7463,1.8958,6.6575,3.5048,2.5601,3.5627,2.4586,0.0034,2.6359,5.975,1.5296,1.5016,1.7649,0.0668,2.5893,0.042,0.1639,2.9226,1.8537,2.0636,0.2452,2.3837,0.5352,3.592,3.489,1.8225,1.4538,1.828,5.2565,0.0372,0.8777]}

Paramedics arrive on scene, and confusion sets in.\n\nThe truck is loaded with debris, and all of a sudden the truck overturns, and a huge black trash truck begins dragging a large amount off of the road. Several people died in that incident. It now has a roof on top, and the truck is on the ground with a heavy amount of firefighting material, and everything that was thrown from the truck is now tossed through the driver's window. The truck is not able to escape. That means you have to turn around to avoid the truck's destruction if you had to turn around to get out.\n\nWhen it was a lot longer before someone could recover from this loss, Paramedics were at the scene to assist a woman who had been badly burned while being forced out of her car on the street.\n\n\"It is very tragic and tragic news in our community, both for our local and community around here. That is all I want you to know that I have the full custody of my children, my wife and our two dogs, all and I have the custody of my two daughters, four cats, and two dogs.\n\nI pray that God is with you while you are suffering in this sad time. I pray for your safety and my prayers are with you, the families of these victims. I know there will be more pain than I have ever known in my life... But, I also know... God will save everyone.\" - John C.

He can't be named because the case against the man is currently being pursued by the police, but officials believe it's still unclear who this individual was.\n\nThe man is described as being 5'6\u2033 tall and about 170 pounds with short hair. He was originally from Missouri who may have been looking for money or to get into a job.\n\nAuthorities say he walked into the front door of a home, pulled out a knife and struck a woman in the back of her head. Officials at the scene said they're still investigating the murder.

Make us feel.' - Pashtuns\n\nShare via e-mail\n\nCaught up, the Pashtuns, who used a small gun, had just gotten out of the camp when their army was surrounded by four army trucks on Sunday night (October 4).\n\nAccording to local reports, the soldiers were trying to put away weapons from the trucks, and were chased out of the camp.\n\nOne of the trucks was later recovered and thrown out of the camp by two security guards.\n\n\u201cYou had to turn around to get out, and you have to get out again to get them to turn around.\u201d\n\nThe soldiers at the Camp were told to stay put. Most of the Pashtuns were staying out until October 13th to be safe.\n\nThe soldiers had to turn in their weapons before they were allowed to evacuate due to their age. They also had to take medicine that day, with the exception of alcohol and coffee or water.\n\nThe troops did not take any medication, and were given no money to keep them safe from bullets and bullets.\n\nA Pashtuns leader said that as long as their soldiers were still in their camp, they would keep their weapons.\n\n\u201cWhen you take their guns out of their eyes, they want to die. And when soldiers are dying, when they are alive, they want to bury them.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to sacrifice their lives, and the army can\u2019t give them these weapons again. They already were able to bury their bodies.\n\n\u201cThey were able to find some way to pay their respect to the dead.

You are called into God's office to discuss your finished project - the platypus. You have a responsibility to do your job. You work with a beautiful 'Spirit' to help the animals of the world, while they are at their best. You are blessed with the gift of love and compassion. You have a special connection to those of us who are so close. You are the ultimate 'Spirit' to our Creator.

Your ultimate goal is to fulfill all of your animal love desires.\n\nYou are the ultimate'spirit' to our Creator.

I am trying really hard, but I don't know what I want to do. Right now, with this situation all my thoughts are on love and kindness---whether it's to my family or to my friends and love the human being in question....but how much I love animals is something I am sure God loves even as well.\n\nI have been wanting to teach my husband how to use humor, although this can be a difficult one. I think this is one of the hardest things about teaching a child...it's something I do...but I think it can help them to understand the love that exists both for animals (like me) and for the human beings in their own minds. I hope that by the time I teach him how to use humor, he will be able to accept it and enjoy being around animals too!\n\nThanks for the post. Love your post. I think I'll put on some humor like \"a nice place to start\"...but I'd like to see him through all of it. Not a whole bunch of pictures, but a bunch of his photos. It shows he still enjoys being around animals.\n\nThank you so much <3\n\nLove,\n\nJeff\n\n__________________\n\nWhen I'm doing something silly, even silly thoughts can cause me to gawk at things for an extended period of time.\n\nAs with any discipline, you can start with a clear picture of the intent--the thought doesn't have to be perfect, but you can quickly and quietly take it in a direction that can be seen.","token_len":528,"entropy":[8.5816,3.1394,4.5125,5.0219,1.9501,5.0827,1.1986,7.2273,1.1555,10.3399,0.1597,4.825,8.3781,2.3749,6.9608,0.7539,1.9224,0.9321,2.6717,1.0052,3.9528,4.5966,6.1122,0.0837,5.1335,1.4437,6.3265,2.5848,12.2275,3.3159,6.4079,3.1601,8.9739,1.2821,0.0026,0.9919,1.7858,2.7324,1.9757,5.7073,0.1915,3.5765,2.0538,1.5531,1.5119,1.5875,4.5852,2.3076,2.4504,5.4906,9.0784,6.6469,1.2308,1.8883,2.2548,3.6363,3.285,3.5557,0.5773,1.6481,3.3354,3.8041,3.5843,1.3816,3.5762,2.3271,0.8439,0.4,1.5261,1.2185,4.7168,0.6366,1.8902,3.5174,0.1067,3.9074,1.2649,2.2729,0.7255,1.157,2.3411,1.5894,3.416,2.6424,0.909,4.6362,4.005,1.8627,0.4638,1.5737,5.4821,2.491,2.5018,1.1118,0.9051,2.4883,4.3782,3.7571,3.399,1.1494,2.7679,3.1914,4.7425,0.4346,1.3085,0.7011,1.4558,5.6952,0.0024,0.023,2.7545,1.5167,2.6982,0.1014,2.5094,2.1329,1.4092,5.1265,0.225,3.0535,1.5395,2.6591,5.2893,3.6624,0.0566,2.1981,0.1732,5.2594,4.2385,0.8594,5.1738,1.3996,5.6514,2.5302,3.2112,1.462,4.6286,3.0847,7.3951,1.3922,0.2187,0.2348,5.3066,2.9381,1.0333,0.7696,3.7647,3.5395,2.9033,1.0703,1.7093,0.0003,1.3922,1.0149,2.4869,2.0097,8.9928,10.3337,2.5668,6.6315,2.4546,2.1535,0.5565,0.6718,0.9719,0.6195,0.7277,3.4462,4.168,1.6075,3.3113,0.8909,0.3968,0.4714,1.0668,0.1359,0.3256,1.5764,0.0002,4.8272,4.0345,4.9446,1.8552,6.8942,1.9028,3.7419,5.0625,2.8045,3.7133,2.792,1.6512,0.8384,0.1171,0.4142,1.4444,3.2783,0.0005,0.4456,4.4003,0.7712,1.7522,3.2752,4.1335,2.1801,5.3765,5.8621,7.1149,0.708,1.2837,2.5338,3.9134,6.1997,0.0129,2.8637,0.9994,0.7586,1.8776,0.0005,0.3816,1.0377,1.3398,2.6641,0.9323,0.2439,0.5647,6.7502,0.0148,0.696,5.7653,2.6048,5.7442,5.7819,3.9985,3.4022,0.4083,2.3361,7.1744,1.4057,4.7612,10.2151,5.6019,0.7211,1.0814,3.1876,1.9832,3.2125,1.0485,0.9627,1.0302,1.5108,2.7659,6.6703,4.2397,6.0668,1.8994,2.7432,3.8765,5.2194,2.8777,5.8514,3.1096,2.669,2.1629,2.1065,1.55,2.5651,0.4846,2.2,4.3514,6.3389,2.9026,5.0562,5.6067,4.3104,0.5643,1.2859,0.0003,1.248,2.4709,1.9243,5.135,0.1744,5.9916,1.7528,5.4444,2.7971,0.0866,3.7025,8.0587,2.7599,7.4975,3.4751,5.0753,0.6881,1.3787,2.5729,4.0262,0.7954,1.1947,3.0417,3.5644,0.8693,2.6733,0.2876,0.325,2.3125,0.7102,2.6577,0.6339,1.8809,0.87,6.0891,3.0349,1.026,4.0818,1.4412,3.8353,6.6852,1.6484,1.1653,3.0968,1.1602,3.3125,4.0121,4.4201,1.7468,2.279,1.8558,3.8802,1.5856,4.2064,7.297,2.3913,2.4041,5.2657,3.8925,1.3849,0.2932,0.0433,0.5269,2.2037,0.8573,2.9718,1.7623,2.6839,4.8002,6.1292,0.3476,1.5927,2.9742,1.5216,2.8824,4.637,0.121,0.8887,2.2316,2.3212,1.8176,0.0351,0.4431,0.0879,0.7485,0.7987,0.4798,1.1248,0.563,0.0033,4.7047,2.6629,1.3708,4.6739,3.21,2.4772,1.1708,5.5675,2.0974,0.4964,0.0003,4.8671,0.6622,4.0424,5.9164,1.6364,5.7922,3.8541,4.4367,1.7469,2.5051,4.1991,2.0643,2.6216,4.4023,4.0269,1.7619,4.5882,6.221,4.321,6.0439,4.9348,6.0113,0.533,4.259,5.3353,1.9643,1.1921,4.0263,1.4398,0.1861,2.6011,3.2287,7.4419,3.795,0.5163,1.6453,0.7432,6.8911,3.8959,4.3622,4.0723,0.4739,5.1254,1.3643,0.6865,1.5977,2.7583,0.3556,7.6374,4.8613,0.7861,3.8835,5.8542,4.6143,5.0591,3.8814,1.5106,0.2919,0.4794,1.1527,1.1939,0.0003,3.1638,0.0271,1.6192,0.0307,8.3039,0.0377,0.765,0.0003,4.3488,0.4325,0.5925,0.0002,5.7814,1.2199,0.0003,5.1618,1.0735,0.6464,0.0002,6.2859,1.184,3.543,4.3739,2.6467,5.0102,0.9718,6.2691,3.3707,8.0751,2.2947,3.8035,1.6135,0.661,7.3506,4.3276,1.8215,3.6054,4.6518,4.3298,2.1118,0.2081,0.0961,0.0009,0.3184,2.4572,0.0002,4.7682,4.7403,1.6054,6.8513,0.3577,2.385,2.3709,4.8716,1.8134,1.8055,6.2538,3.3749,0.907,1.9459,5.4256,6.5409,2.7633,4.8665,7.5545,0.0007,1.5304,0.0678,0.3877,4.2848,1.2079,0.7204,2.6485,0.9209,5.7779,4.1329,5.5264,4.4956,1.2433,3.8426,3.7389,2.8125,0.585,4.3771,1.3592,4.0072,3.761]}

{"id":4379,"ended":true,"length":485,"text":"Computer viruses can now be transmitted onto humans.\n\nThe virus known as \"Virus Control.\"\n\nIn theory, \"Virus Control\" means that viruses, while they behave perfectly as an integrated virus, can be transmitted remotely from their host computer. But now, viruses can be transmitted remotely from the host computer to humans.\n\n\"The basic idea behind this is that viruses can be injected into human systems. It allows us to create viruses that can infect us, and that makes it possible for viruses to travel between two computers. And if viruses travel between two computers, it makes sense that human beings will be infected because humans have more viruses as well,\" said Dr. Andrew Bittke from Virginia Commonwealth University and the University of Virginia.\n\nWhat's a typical path to infect humans?\n\nDr. Bittke states the virus is actually very similar in structure to the virus that infects our own skin.\n\nThe virus also has an infection mechanism that prevents it from being transmitted from human to human or from other human to human, according to Bittke.\n\n\"The virus is being produced without the support and support of the immune system. The immune system doesn't have as much power to make it work as it would,\" he explains.\n\nHow can researchers use computer viruses to help their researchers out?\n\nExperts say computer viruses are known to be able to use special software for many of the same reasons that humans use those computer viruses.\n\nIn that regard, \"Viral\" software provides the same ability to infect human and other creatures that cause the infection of viruses. In fact, the virus may be more common than first thought, according to Bittke.\n\nHowever, \"Viral\" software is not really as easy to use as computer versions.\n\nAs such, \"Viral\" programming is required for making the viruses available to the public. However, the viruses are not widely distributed across the world, nor is there enough technology to make computer viruses available in the same way which may be useful for researchers.\n\nThe development of computer viruses means that computers often are limited in their capabilities. The ability to learn from viruses and to exploit vulnerabilities in computers is an important aspect. This means that computer viruses need to adapt at their level, and a computer virus can be adaptable to a variety of environments.\n\nDr. Bittke, a computer software engineering student from Virginia Commonwealth University, and his partner Dr. Andrew Bittke, a computer engineering graduate student from Virginia Commonwealth University, are working to develop and use computer viruses to help their researchers out.","token_len":533,"entropy":[11.5502,3.7016,5.5262,0.8154,4.4576,7.7458,6.1053,1.7658,1.1492,0.0004,2.0187,2.0357,5.5803,0.0159,3.4982,2.9813,1.0433,7.9859,6.2365,1.3406,0.0003,3.5805,5.5808,0.0973,5.0778,0.5255,0.1791,0.0083,0.1095,2.8293,1.3327,3.0593,4.0264,5.3641,2.7955,6.3826,6.2369,4.062,5.8435,5.6129,3.6744,0.4863,0.964,0.98,1.9456,7.0417,2.4142,5.4337,1.2459,1.3225,2.0098,2.4941,4.5032,1.3981,5.4036,0.9447,0.6444,1.0235,2.467,0.8642,2.706,1.9397,0.2365,1.3056,3.5895,1.0754,0.823,0.0002,1.9877,2.5034,5.7467,1.1547,2.0241,1.935,0.735,0.6774,2.224,1.5943,0.6192,5.7811,0.7902,2.5,3.2499,2.5615,2.8541,4.335,1.359,0.0381,3.8542,3.1527,0.8653,1.2794,2.3654,4.1905,1.9604,1.4204,2.599,4.4308,1.1031,1.2615,1.0102,3.2452,0.2159,4.7948,3.1635,5.6095,1.9353,2.9132,2.631,3.2249,3.7087,3.8201,2.0099,1.1559,0.2493,0.3443,2.5132,2.1613,2.196,1.1215,6.6251,2.6426,2.9839,0.9887,0.7341,3.7634,4.6179,2.5453,3.8538,2.7918,6.5122,1.4639,0.5325,1.0737,2.238,0.0932,5.2991,4.6642,5.181,6.577,3.8259,5.6924,1.4488,0.0162,3.1844,2.0296,2.238,0.0346,2.0539,1.165,0.1172,0.0002,5.1829,1.9724,4.6615,6.6843,6.8011,3.0916,1.891,3.4573,0.3412,0.2833,0.0001,4.4332,0.0072,0.9143,0.0084,0.0009,6.9975,3.3124,1.5144,2.0192,5.2033,3.5961,1.5519,2.9143,1.6134,0.2152,1.5907,2.7445,1.0826,2.3795,0.0148,4.4801,2.7173,3.6904,0.5112,1.2141,0.0001,2.3126,1.1561,4.814,1.3713,3.1273,5.992,2.8676,1.2449,4.2839,0.8229,0.0853,2.9748,1.4217,2.0984,2.821,0.9099,0.4246,5.0193,1.3233,3.6436,2.6144,0.9324,0.6308,2.5786,3.2781,0.0024,1.5647,0.0054,0.0009,0.0997,0.277,0.0001,1.292,2.0001,1.8999,1.3051,6.2622,3.9502,6.7797,2.017,6.2265,4.4752,3.4536,0.0772,1.6836,2.7875,0.0256,1.1768,2.0746,1.745,0.0504,3.1765,0.0003,2.1899,5.3159,0.2737,2.8078,0.9773,3.696,3.4645,1.3329,0.9496,0.4243,2.6616,6.694,1.071,5.0972,0.0434,0.2683,0.0002,2.9052,1.7567,5.6574,3.1399,4.8199,0.1586,0.2465,3.1593,4.9844,3.7148,6.3286,0.1481,0.0118,0.0001,6.5003,1.7098,3.1903,0.071,1.4515,6.9403,0.351,0.8223,2.7167,0.0052,5.2723,5.8728,2.7818,4.5018,5.6196,2.0145,0.714,1.7056,2.1046,0.9882,2.4788,1.2881,6.0264,3.2551,0.6221,0.8332,0.4691,0.0001,3.2964,4.9995,3.3066,0.0282,3.3428,3.2265,3.4551,5.4047,3.6837,5.0566,2.3426,3.6723,4.1553,0.5807,2.1137,2.0223,2.159,1.3803,5.2293,3.0045,7.2329,3.259,3.1113,2.1139,1.9287,0.8448,3.989,1.7791,0.008,2.1181,1.3914,3.9195,1.032,3.5377,4.4626,0.662,6.0857,0.0911,1.5598,1.7645,0.0019,1.3605,0.006,0.0009,0.1207,0.0848,0.0001,4.3333,0.0187,2.7423,0.9381,0.5774,0.5133,0.4012,1.4458,1.39,5.1345,4.5715,2.8026,0.3131,0.7371,0.4056,3.9779,7.6553,1.6644,0.9159,0.0001,4.8732,4.1965,0.0238,2.2709,0.5929,0.4578,0.1308,4.5518,1.178,5.5574,1.5241,6.358,2.1418,2.7962,3.5007,0.8127,2.1082,0.7092,0.6786,3.5379,0.0058,2.2928,4.1201,1.6219,1.5842,5.0996,1.2686,4.5192,0.514,1.2034,1.4848,5.7555,2.6661,1.5909,4.0994,5.176,0.4119,1.3602,4.9641,0.8048,1.3631,2.3832,1.2742,3.8558,0.3894,9.0917,6.0879,1.3251,3.5723,0.8284,3.4408,1.0918,0.1556,0.0002,2.9469,5.8714,0.2481,1.0845,0.1868,5.1225,0.7767,5.4726,6.4365,3.0814,5.2731,1.0154,1.4796,1.9157,1.2969,3.4211,3.1692,0.2152,5.8521,1.9744,1.7567,2.0664,2.6096,3.9653,4.2032,1.3635,2.8181,1.5423,3.4436,0.6348,2.2973,3.8319,4.7562,1.7497,0.426,3.0854,0.3537,3.9865,0.4866,5.8294,5.4806,3.8771,5.3783,2.6783,1.7192,5.1885,2.5901,0.9379,1.5635,1.3608,6.0015,0.2058,1.2639,2.4121,1.6517,0.0007,2.118,0.5576,0.2204,0.0002,3.992,0.0077,0.7139,0.0052,0.0011,3.694,3.449,2.3185,7.0411,4.069,2.5455,3.1034,0.9708,0.2331,0.1907,0.2766,2.9352,0.6538,5.0251,2.1572,0.0089,4.3175,0.7277,0.0419,0.0042,1.5568,2.3363,1.122,3.243,2.3407,0.1266,0.8591,1.4146,0.0706,0.0125,0.3828,2.0717,2.3501,1.4095,0.88,3.2219,2.9862,0.8124,0.1929,0.9118,1.2051,1.4827,1.0164,0.252,0.1758]}

So the test has become a reliable system to help parents to see whether their mother has the right to have children.\n\nIf the test isn\u2019t beneficial to both parents, you only need to pass one year of the test before you can try doing the test. The test also has a lot of questions to be on to help your parents find out what their best plan has worked and what they need to do next year to get a fair deal.\n\nIt\u2019s quite simple and you shouldn\u2019t feel that pressure in trying to choose which option to take right now. But you don\u2019t want to try to do it before the test has started because you are sure that your mother will have the same idea to take the test.\n\nThe Test Test :\n\nSo what should you do? First of all, you should do a test as soon as possible. A parent who has a child will be able to use the test for almost all their children. If you have two children, one will want to go to bed early, and one will want to do chores instead. If you want to keep your kid safe at home, that\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t need to test children to get them to sleep properly. If you want to have fun in your job, then you won\u2019t need too much.\n\nAlso, when you\u2019re taking a test as well as taking a test, you\u2019ll want to make sure that you\u2019re actually on time for the test too. If you have a parent that has kids, and they know when to do the test, then they can always get that child in the next few days to help them stay safe.\n\nThe test is definitely not what you wanted to hear.\n\nNow you can also use the test for making sure that your kids get an accurate education. But it can also be used as a test at any level, and a parent who has a child will be ready to take the test and try their best to make sure that those kids in college still have a good life.","token_len":534,"entropy":[8.8066,10.3929,3.4844,5.1889,2.4363,1.942,14.2759,6.2712,6.6397,0.0432,6.6019,1.5686,4.3387,3.145,1.1772,1.9805,8.8284,2.1846,1.4855,1.1799,5.805,2.8337,7.6536,2.8557,2.4629,0.7778,3.482,0.5028,1.1453,5.2277,1.672,5.0141,0.9232,2.701,5.5023,2.445,2.163,2.7235,2.9611,4.0846,3.8909,0.0833,0.5231,3.7127,2.9099,2.3385,1.1208,2.5847,2.0723,6.4658,2.064,0.795,5.5719,2.3156,3.315,3.9725,5.1704,2.887,3.7827,1.8042,2.7893,3.742,4.7955,2.3589,3.4342,2.3876,0.9806,0.2122,5.9421,3.5396,3.1646,5.4852,2.0006,3.8062,5.0657,1.1677,5.4599,0.0812,0.1181,2.7569,0.5218,5.3974,2.007,0.4625,4.8371,2.0004,2.6203,5.8455,2.5453,3.9392,5.0139,3.7006,2.0435,4.2582,1.8839,2.7271,2.0224,1.2088,2.463,0.9215,0.8567,2.982,2.9233,1.9123,3.5529,2.4414,1.0893,6.7922,6.4095,2.7717,2.1621,1.5336,3.4695,1.9568,2.3312,0.9864,5.1514,0.9935,0.4353,0.3278,0.3171,0.36,0.3419,0.4678,0.9153,0.0014,4.2181,2.7896,1.6602,4.5027,18.3384,7.2211,1.801,8.1676,1.5515,4.5284,0.7755,0.8262,2.2177,7.1592,1.7917,0.2699,4.1909,4.5019,6.9441,1.259,0.8376,0.6135,2.9244,0.7494,0.7956,6.1768,6.8006,1.3062,2.1386,2.2972,2.8551,2.264,4.0037,2.5326,1.3671,3.5288,0.1027,5.69,2.0447,4.3687,8.4181,3.6019,2.7527,3.5644,1.1391,4.0922,0.9746,1.8619,3.0456,3.1637,4.2643,6.6306,4.5369,2.7576,0.6577,1.6494,2.2585,0.194,0.6379,3.0486,5.1132,1.3793,1.377,2.8025,5.3462,3.7547,0.5234,0.9566,0.0002,4.0719,6.2483,0.4051,0.308,4.3356,2.4817,3.2429,3.0284,5.7872,0.0741,0.3533,0.0184,4.1739,3.6062,8.1193,4.4347,3.7933,0.1399,4.8013,3.3263,3.2496,1.2541,0.8905,6.3052,0.3059,0.2638,2.3588,2.3725,3.313,0.1502,0.2742,0.0096,1.4977,0.2806,5.0082,1.4418,3.2641,1.7312,4.5828,2.1866,1.8318,3.0134,2.197,3.3625,1.3449,2.4981,3.9559,0.912,1.39,1.7307,0.7948,2.4578,1.9007,3.3046,4.5994,4.2636,2.4747,1.2553,0.1947,1.055,1.1,0.0002,2.8697,3.4012,5.9463,6.8324,2.6709,0.0002,4.1251,1.7291,3.0737,1.0518,0.3098,1.5423,3.3112,0.9441,0.0025,0.368,1.7348,0.6424,3.2668,1.8457,2.1545,4.8079,1.2655,0.0059,0.4978,0.7458,4.2716,4.9465,1.8466,1.1625,1.9318,0.9978,2.8996,2.5341,1.768,0.0105,4.3644,0.8087,0.61,3.2025,5.4661,2.3529,2.379,2.7655,1.0044,2.6759,1.3217,2.1877,2.9881,0.8055,0.8326,3.9408,2.3364,5.2866,0.3135,1.9164,0.6157,4.988,1.1988,1.7162,1.4199,2.6369,0.2872,0.3549,0.0422,3.8542,4.0552,6.0625,1.008,2.1889,0.5431,2.6475,0.348,4.6166,1.7646,5.4101,3.5994,4.0906,0.7916,0.4136,4.8004,7.3246,0.2349,0.3086,3.7864,0.7289,2.5057,2.1773,0.0912,0.0865,0.0021,1.9589,0.152,3.8135,5.2819,2.7144,3.0948,1.6981,0.5147,3.408,5.6427,0.454,2.7129,0.3854,0.5371,0.4331,2.6536,3.9249,3.7088,2.8153,4.9088,0.3939,3.4482,0.9336,5.6354,0.1644,0.0695,0.0136,0.646,8.8431,0.5975,3.1279,1.2231,0.0002,4.1964,0.3175,4.437,0.664,6.8497,0.1166,2.4276,4.8541,2.087,0.1687,5.238,4.3456,0.8918,4.3322,1.3273,2.0208,2.3705,0.9282,3.4392,0.1539,0.8816,1.5278,0.1517,2.8261,0.044,0.4632,1.1853,1.691,0.0439,0.8727,5.1635,5.5294,1.9333,2.2112,1.0196,0.4601,5.9778,0.1615,1.9627,0.4634,2.204,1.2923,5.5993,3.4381,1.6489,3.4493,0.9289,2.7099,1.4639,5.4308,3.2678,1.0183,3.4619,1.4578,0.4857,0.6979,0.7059,1.1443,1.8916,5.0926,3.4784,3.8254,3.4387,3.1395,1.1352,2.9051,2.1065,0.8985,2.8431,3.713,1.2486,5.2146,2.5694,0.6749,1.2074,0.0002,2.6426,2.2198,1.4908,6.3336,1.5557,5.0477,0.6307,4.4353,1.1498,5.7749,1.2677,2.7882,0.0002,4.4475,2.5954,2.1554,5.2134,2.772,0.8906,0.6622,3.0276,5.5294,1.7074,0.363,0.7122,3.4482,2.9533,4.7382,3.7846,5.2522,0.7464,3.9154,2.79,3.6113,1.6685,0.7675,1.0057,2.2149,0.2972,1.837,6.3571,3.2184,3.5027,2.4969,2.1352,4.5043,4.7731,1.8994,1.3359,1.1436,0.2963,2.4961,1.5764,6.1478,0.4096,1.3492,0.7008,0.051,3.5384,5.1593,4.3096,0.312,0.6194,2.3861,0.1237,0.3474,5.8621,0.5117,6.0101,6.9014,5.5224,1.5765,1.6762,1.272,3.6486,0.8271]}

Then, the winner is given a night\u2019s accommodations in a hotel rooms belonging to one of his sons.\n\nThat evening, the winner is offered free air transportation to an international airport where he arrives before 11 p.m. at the same time that night.\n\nThe winner has to pay for a \u201crent\u201d to the hotel for his stay.\n\nIt ends with the winner having to pay back the $ 400,000,000 prize after completing the night\u2019s accommodations and a free flight to the airport.\n\nRothman says that $ 400,000,000 is the prize too big for a black market bank.\n\n\u201cThere are thousands of people who will pay what can be said to be massive amounts of money for that prize,\u201d he said. \u201cI am aware of many who will be disappointed.\u201d\n\nHe says he is hopeful the book will get attention and that no one who pays for the tickets will get a \u201cpay-for-money\u201d refund.\n\nBut for now, he would like it if others paid for \u201cthe ticket\u201d just so they could claim it.\n\n\u201cHopefully we at least get some attention, because those tickets are not the reward for what an incredible book and story should be, especially with all those black market bank\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be a very memorable one.\u201d","token_len":538,"entropy":[12.5031,9.8041,1.4683,10.2129,0.4911,3.1397,8.1586,2.1788,1.8103,4.1864,12.2369,2.0723,0.0183,5.1492,2.1144,2.8042,0.0038,0.8784,10.3483,2.3663,3.41,0.5659,2.5587,7.774,0.7989,5.8901,9.6749,7.7987,1.8825,1.562,4.9575,1.9834,1.2811,0.0039,2.8737,5.0218,4.3091,5.7293,3.6943,3.478,5.9023,0.0941,2.8266,5.1628,0.0151,3.1504,6.9656,3.9745,0.8187,2.3305,7.0342,2.7146,5.4524,4.322,7.6821,0.0029,4.0516,4.3417,5.438,2.7532,3.6681,6.1404,0.3032,2.5816,0.5596,3.571,0.172,2.5077,1.5482,2.3207,0.0003,3.8443,5.8686,5.3885,2.8378,5.9792,1.7814,6.8239,1.4801,5.5359,2.2181,0.1903,1.6087,0.0024,1.6624,5.0829,2.1222,2.7611,6.1976,0.8072,2.0332,3.3012,0.6126,5.4864,1.0861,4.3816,1.7603,1.2589,2.1722,5.9806,0.374,3.5543,4.9044,0.8121,4.9784,0.2295,3.9932,1.8004,0.9404,0.0003,2.2938,1.5864,3.4701,3.9274,4.9599,0.1941,7.2383,1.6089,3.9645,0.2845,1.2487,2.2592,8.8505,0.7986,1.8533,4.882,0.5768,0.967,2.7766,0.0443,0.0088,4.6976,4.9111,0.1264,3.9124,3.9839,1.9859,1.6728,6.2285,0.1748,1.58,0.8289,0.5079,0.0003,4.3309,3.781,1.3758,2.5833,6.5451,4.6148,2.5912,0.8656,0.0002,2.5067,3.8507,2.2158,4.1215,7.1074,4.809,1.3688,0.3586,0.9343,0.2165,0.6176,2.4978,2.9035,0.0658,3.3856,0.0126,2.3609,1.4785,4.4354,3.075,0.6542,4.0528,0.0818,3.7115,2.0579,3.5809,2.203,1.309,1.3125,0.6784,3.1326,0.7243,0.9363,5.2943,3.3752,0.7428,4.2284,2.5221,3.2724,4.3131,1.4455,2.4696,0.1788,4.4341,0.6617,7.0917,2.6694,3.8868,1.5462,1.9405,2.5021,0.4197,2.4603,5.6201,0.3434,0.4792,0.0002,1.7226,4.899,1.8258,0.262,1.7281,4.2145,0.007,0.0007,3.6864,4.5627,1.3558,4.7262,5.769,7.6742,1.842,4.3271,0.8261,6.2795,1.953,7.8773,1.594,1.4479,2.9508,3.8561,1.0451,2.5874,0.5137,1.3672,5.1732,1.1156,2.1974,1.4362,2.2733,1.7763,0.7691,6.1199,15.0063,8.0739,6.8988,6.0139,2.336,1.0616,1.1119,7.639,5.4318,0.0061,4.1019,0.1312,1.6955,0.6277,0.6945,0.3949,0.0003,4.6765,4.5625,0.2652,1.2492,1.1378,1.8685,4.0652,4.3269,4.8021,5.925,0.7446,4.3749,5.023,0.5219,3.0515,0.8904,5.8897,4.5853,5.0229,0.9618,0.0008,0.0001,0.49,4.2574,0.9229,5.1943,1.9836,2.0493,7.5592,0.9406,0.6801,0.0002,1.5725,1.4332,3.7811,0.7445,1.5665,1.9463,2.1123,15.9318,6.2129,10.8257,3.344,7.2472,2.544,1.8694,1.209,2.9673,2.7707,2.2928,1.1137,1.1841,0.0002,4.2094,5.8209,1.3312,0.909,0.4179,3.1977,0.1943,0.8792,4.411,0.8432,0.9915,1.8533,0.0008,0.0008,0.9071,0.0701,1.6914,3.7293,7.5592,1.3874,4.1351,1.1657,0.2921,0.9903,3.7663,2.2749,4.1251,3.2211,2.1883,0.688,1.5458,0.5784,0.7964,0.2216,0.0002,2.3149,0.0047,0.0008,2.2735,1.6978,6.1394,0.7319,0.0021,0.0008,0.3894,0.0022,0.8524,2.375,2.7055,7.2986,2.4174,1.571,2.0802,2.7407,1.8836,3.2677,1.4652,0.4958,0.0002,4.9485,2.101,6.1688,1.0488,4.8931,0.1304,2.6541,0.8073,3.567,2.7213,6.4692,5.9631,0.7417,4.3124,1.9692,0.1468,7.5533,2.3976,0.4984,0.0505,1.7641,4.6616,3.3337,1.741,6.8974,6.7565,3.7001,1.1313,0.2341,4.4642,0.397,4.8202,3.4537,5.6873,0.8378,2.5684,2.174,1.3606,2.6627,2.9102,1.9077,2.5757,3.8743,0.8303,0.0002,3.4011,2.0375,2.2001,2.2201,4.3658,2.3864,1.7858,0.3741,3.9488,4.7123,2.1712,2.1957,5.4965,0.3859,4.1768,4.3077,2.6954,1.1915,3.8221,0.716,3.0753,2.4969,11.8765,0.9061,5.5071,4.1717,2.5638,0.3468,9.7079,0.3746,1.5993,2.674,0.3055,0.1786,0.0003,2.4271,3.8267,2.0068,0.1152,1.7646,5.3639,0.5891,3.9893,3.7053,5.0755,3.6022,1.0685,10.4163,0.1045,0.708,2.2099,0.9981,1.1513,5.3467,2.5132,0.9542,0.4543,4.4538,1.2166,0.9373,0.2293,0.0003,1.9677,0.754,6.624,3.3164,7.1901,1.3971,1.0578,1.5773,2.183,2.9979,4.3352,5.66,2.4315,1.1001,3.1903,3.8376,7.4607,1.2874,4.1012,5.328,3.9786,4.2505,3.4592,4.1491,4.4382,0.5704,3.1975,5.4536,3.5232,3.3367,3.184,4.4669,0.9414,4.8877,7.0458,2.1369,0.4279,3.8415,1.8181,2.6834,0.9143,0.1426,0.0339,3.3157,0.3614,2.9269,3.3162,0.6425,1.6353,4.2992,5.2653,3.8591,1.4151,0.3908,1.4839]}

island country to visit his grandfather, Father Kim Il-sung, who died in 1991, the world's longest since the end of World War II.\nThe South Korean delegation had included the US General Michael Flynn, the president of North America and Mr Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who was reportedly the one to make the announcement and whom Mr Kim later later told was \"very proud\" of.\nThe visit will be the latest by the North American president to follow Kim's footsteps in Korea and perhaps the North's most famous leader.\nKim's father Kim Il-sung has travelled to Japan several times in recent years with North Korean military leaders and Pyongyang's chief political adviser Kim Yong-chol.\nPresident Donald Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have both travelled to Japan in recent months with North Korean military leaders and Pyongyang's chief political adviser Kim Yong-chol.\nHowever, Mr Trump and his associates have not discussed North Korean war history, despite having long been the subject of intense public debate.\nOn April 9, the US president, who was re-elected in February 2020 under his predecessor Barack Obama, spoke of his grandfather who died last April in the United States following a struggle with cancer.\nHe offered his condolences to Mr Kim who was buried last year in South Korea under a stone monument in Pyongyang.\n\"It was a sad news but that doesn't mean there will not be any good times between the two leaders,\" Mr Trump said.\nAt the UN General Assembly last week, Mr Trump said he was aware of the \"difficulties between President Trump and President Kim to live with the truth of North Korea\".\nHe had also promised to pursue \"long-term peace negotiations\" with North Korea ahead of an early summit meeting between Mr Trump and senior administration officials this month.\nSpeaking at the UN in September, Mr Trump suggested he could discuss the North Korean crisis in the next few days, as it was the time to put pressure on Kim Jong-un's regime.\nMr Trump said at the time he was aware that he and his predecessors had faced difficulties.\n\"It was a difficult time to go forward, but at the same time we're making good

(Photo by KUOW)\nThe Grand Piano is home to many local businesses.\n\"In a small town in Wisconsin, people come into this shop. It's the largest place, if you'll use it, to have pizza, and they have all kinds of things. And Grandma had said, 'We want this big piano to go here,' and because everything else is done as a kind of restaurant, people really dig it. And people think it's a cool place, we've really gotten a lot of people interested in this place,\" said Linda Wieber, owner of the Old Mill.\nWieber is a former grandpa who lives with his grandpa. She says his piano was given to him with a gift from his grandmother, a woman she loved dearly.\n\"When I walked in, she said, 'You know, it was a gift from her. You know, she sent it to you. And as long as she's alive, you know, she's going to be happy. And she says, 'Thank you'.'\" Linda said.\nShe says when they first open their doors, they are just opening for business.\n\"It's always a thrill to see the artwork that they have on the Grand Piano,\" said Linda.\nLinda says her customers love seeing the artwork that they were given.\n\"And they love to see their grandpa, thank you for that too,\" said Linda. \"And when you open the door, you know, we've always had a positive influence on everybody and everybody, and we always tell everyone, 'Thank you.'\"\nMore: Grand piano at Old Mill is a win-win, but the best part is getting people into Old Mill and staying loyal.\nEven in the difficult times, Linda still hopes for the future.\n\"I think it's what's best for the people of Madison, and so it's great that we are keeping up with things, just like we did on our anniversary.

{"id":4073,"ended":false,"length":524,"text":"An older wealthy woman takes the city bus for the first time... [Katherine]\n\nAfter four decades of a life full of danger, the young woman who has survived, and is a bright young woman, is forced out of the world and must leave the U.S. to follow her true passion for the city. She comes across a young man named Jack (played by Bruce Willis), whose actions in the past make him very dangerous. Jack knows that if he and Katherine survive, he will be one of Katherine's men in the future. But will he keep up the passion he has for the city or do Katherine turn her life around?\n\nWith Katherine's help, he may decide what he does in his next mission.\n\nAn engaging, fast paced, and heart wrenching story that takes you right off the mark in many ways. Katherine is a very powerful and charismatic actress, both strong and intelligent. I love Katherine. I loved all of her parts and we will always have a long relationship. She is a great example of how good female actors don't work for a TV company and it always gets me!\n\nP.S. I totally relate to this one, but Katherine is my favourite actress I have ever seen. Katherine has an amazing voice. If it didn't sound so natural at first you wouldn't know she's a star, right? LOL!!\n\nKatherine...you'll never forget that...when I found out you were working on a children's series!!...that was a really cool feeling! (as long as it wasn't my husband's show ; )\n\nAwwww, this made me happy. They're really such beautiful actors and it was hard to find anything like it to watch on television. Love Katherine. If I ever had the chance to see a young Katherine, I would watch. I would love to see her perform and be around her now, just so I could let her know how good she is to do shows. I absolutely love Katherine. She has such a positive energy. I know this will be a challenge because she's so funny, but what she does is so great.\n\nI loved watching her play Katherine, and I'm very excited for her return on A Place in the Sun. It'll be interesting to watch her performance in a new TV series! And I love watching her talk about her career since she plays Katherine for me, and hearing everything she tells me. She'll be getting some much needed TV playing time, since she'll be returning to play Katherine's best friend who doesn't know what to do after all the years of experience that happened! Katherine...I loved her! :))","token_len":544,"entropy":[8.7982,11.9323,3.3059,6.4464,2.2414,8.3267,3.7951,3.5948,1.8248,1.4544,0.1236,6.9935,5.3206,7.36,4.5141,3.1329,3.4962,0.0038,6.3528,6.0647,3.0372,0.8849,5.1639,3.1007,4.4679,0.001,5.0777,0.5219,2.6494,3.6249,1.9168,1.6912,3.0042,4.686,4.7156,2.3293,2.6366,4.8051,6.431,1.5147,0.5747,0.8918,1.5114,4.1316,4.5752,0.2596,2.0358,3.562,3.0051,4.4026,5.5183,1.9163,6.6239,0.2657,0.0769,0.148,1.5174,5.557,0.5392,6.7343,3.8138,1.5018,2.124,2.6691,0.6868,3.3161,5.0797,1.726,0.8507,2.4686,1.0563,2.2978,4.1632,3.9086,3.3194,0.0342,5.6396,0.2934,0.9422,4.1847,5.561,2.9753,0.95,2.9285,3.759,1.2598,4.0134,2.721,0.8577,2.3759,5.6743,1.449,2.9829,0.2489,5.8908,4.5956,3.1797,0.8998,1.3292,0.6201,1.8311,4.5557,0.2168,5.7462,0.0435,6.8414,3.3807,0.8,0.7882,0.4649,2.6893,4.2178,0.9293,4.7488,3.8724,1.6144,8.0512,2.1906,0.9116,0.6778,0.4923,0.1707,2.6607,3.7306,5.3016,5.1238,3.2109,3.1843,0.1402,0.6573,2.5823,0.0002,5.1957,4.9918,1.227,2.2315,0.1646,3.3615,5.1241,2.6123,4.6258,2.0515,3.3232,3.7288,2.0305,4.0302,4.7628,0.9916,1.4513,0.0002,4.8172,8.2502,1.8154,4.9433,1.291,1.5469,1.3407,5.5558,3.3121,0.0019,1.1413,2.4226,3.5252,1.7094,5.0011,6.5059,0.0993,4.5914,2.7348,4.9363,0.2169,0.4272,4.901,1.7767,1.0559,3.4697,4.4192,2.2057,4.1752,5.686,1.2384,5.8036,7.8096,0.1459,6.3159,0.4246,4.8881,2.69,4.4517,2.1668,1.6337,3.3858,3.7155,0.8162,0.4903,5.3378,2.503,5.6614,3.1422,2.576,2.4194,1.7232,5.0985,2.7676,0.8195,2.9199,0.8339,1.3738,2.721,4.3,0.2388,1.5752,4.5445,5.7151,1.577,5.8223,0.0007,4.2251,2.9229,3.1771,3.808,6.9075,2.8191,3.2312,5.4439,3.8624,2.8335,5.1392,0.5533,0.0002,5.5743,1.7561,0.0262,0.1784,1.7206,6.0842,9.6126,0.0783,1.5085,3.5121,2.4084,3.1219,5.45,1.2448,3.3816,3.8508,2.0268,3.9661,1.6393,0.6477,0.3521,0.6181,5.2206,2.7193,3.5568,1.4186,1.4826,2.3326,4.392,4.191,3.9708,0.0008,3.2737,1.0818,5.525,5.4371,1.1938,3.689,2.7539,0.0018,1.7995,2.5981,2.8982,1.5269,3.8508,2.4052,3.6625,0.1064,8.1596,4.6469,0.5992,0.0002,3.8933,0.0361,7.4639,4.5527,4.1451,2.2557,2.7397,2.2409,5.8032,6.1426,1.7405,4.8861,0.3426,3.2283,1.1688,4.1187,0.9888,1.5754,6.6373,0.0387,2.4808,6.9408,5.714,3.9083,1.2815,1.99,3.1733,2.0614,3.0506,2.0966,5.1175,6.5154,4.1618,0.0137,2.2148,1.6205,0.0005,3.1732,4.7738,1.3601,4.4712,8.7285,4.5808,0.6276,0.0002,3.9604,3.9205,1.3181,2.0572,3.4494,6.3161,0.2858,3.8502,1.3663,6.5955,2.0445,3.8109,6.0513,4.8361,2.6133,1.7852,3.169,1.469,4.8965,0.6737,2.6712,3.3322,3.2864,3.1726,4.7348,2.7922,3.2795,3.4381,0.5788,6.2515,4.4841,1.6159,5.6592,2.6534,2.1246,2.6038,2.2878,0.6789,0.4259,1.6378,2.5833,5.5996,1.5702,2.3871,0.4343,0.8872,4.0127,5.6287,2.0155,2.6503,1.9016,0.246,0.508,0.6998,5.1063,2.6223,3.021,3.8314,0.4187,6.0546,2.5635,4.3836,3.8075,1.2133,1.1745,5.5815,0.2967,1.7893,2.0944,3.1907,0.4261,0.2969,3.9514,5.3131,9.0904,1.372,1.9612,5.8473,0.4938,2.9081,0.8492,2.303,2.7955,1.5793,0.558,5.3426,1.9023,2.2617,1.5265,3.883,3.4572,2.8323,0.8824,1.4464,4.901,4.6643,1.75,1.5549,1.9659,4.3871,1.5245,1.1511,5.5399,2.3154,1.065,1.2215,1.1552,3.4584,0.6969,2.0535,0.0002,1.799,3.4012,2.391,2.5822,2.5798,2.7894,2.1338,1.4137,1.038,1.9604,2.9835,1.6369,1.8929,1.3096,3.6029,4.2558,5.626,5.1808,3.8523,0.9692,0.8742,0.7585,2.7978,4.2192,0.1606,3.5744,0.1137,3.4996,0.776,5.0573,1.5895,1.9177,2.3977,4.1836,0.7476,3.486,4.364,1.3815,2.2369,3.4046,0.5737,6.4835,0.3766,1.1583,3.0631,7.1884,0.8519,5.3208,2.7753,4.5607,3.7177,2.7903,1.4558,8.3858,6.7623,0.7513,3.9956,0.8676,1.3835,2.5123,3.516,0.5931,5.7439,3.0849,4.5885,0.1623,5.1289,6.6028,0.613,2.5567,6.573,0.929,4.3202,0.5461,4.6936,0.757,2.6452,1.0876,2.8831,4.0138,0.0608,4.6292,4.9384,0.0004,2.0723,2.1842,1.2538,0.1548,4.508,2.5731,2.8608,2.0813,1.1827,7.7664,3.0314,6.0535,6.6682,5.5096,4.0207,2.0676,4.2451,3.9624,2.7598,6.4098,4.7147]}

{"id":2210,"ended":false,"length":511,"text":"Insanity is the main reason for the decline of humanity.\nIt's a common misconception. Humans, the animals, the plants, and the water use have all been on-going, if not continuously on-going. But now people are taking more and more measures to prevent the effects of consumption habits on the human body. If we put everything in balance, humans are likely to become very less social and less adaptable to the social changes that are occurring. That means that humans will only be able to live for so long if they keep themselves together.\nThe good news here is that because humans have been around for centuries, as they are, they are not alone in their decline and are at a critical stage in developing their health. In Africa, the population is much more than 90percent people; in the United States and Canada, it is around 85percent. The reason may have been more than just genetics. For example, in the United Kingdom, where there is a small minority, it is more than 80%. In contrast, in Sweden, where there is a much larger minority, it is about 95 percent; in the U.S., it is almost 80percent.\nAs more and more Europeans are opting out of fossil fuels and are making healthier choices, this increases the likelihood that their health might be affected too. While there is a strong link link between health and aging, for many of the other causes of aging, which may be the primary causes of aging, the link seems to not be as strong.\nHow We Work\n\"The research that I studied actually found that the average American spends more time working than spending their time on any of the other causes of aging.\"\n-- Dr. Michael S. Hall, M.D., professor of biochemistry at Harvard Medical School, and the Robert F. Kennedy School of Government, Kennedy School of Government\n\"Most of us work hard. But what else do we do to make life better?\"\n-- Dr. Nancy K. S.

{"id":4586,"ended":true,"length":501,"text":"Humans have gone extinct. 300,000 years later a new intelligent species has emerged. No proof of human existence has ever been found. An excavation crew has just dug up a radioactive waste containment site, with writing and warning markers still intact, but undecipherable.\n\nThe team of archaeologists dug up radioactive waste, with a sign pointing towards an underground sewer system. The site, which is being excavated by an experimental robotic-operated, underwater robotic excavator, \"A New Way To Discover\" was found with the consent of the National University of South Carolina.\n\nIn a statement, the university said, \"This discovery brings new insights into the history and distribution of human and animal health and related biological and genetic information. The research builds on the findings of previous excavations of the site. The use of unmanned ground vehicles will also offer new insights into the cultural and geological histories of those who lived there.\"\n\nThere has been a long history of mining waste in North Carolina, a state that suffered a devastating oil and gas shortage in the early 20th century.\n\nIn 2011, in North Carolina's most populous county, the waste disposal agency of the state also dug up trash from that county's sewer system.\n\nThis area has had some heavy oil use, but not to the point that it is considered environmentally toxic by local officials.\n\nThe waste disposal agency collected the waste, which went into a trash can in a landfill under the state capitol. Then, in August 2013, they took the waste to another dump site in Winston-Salem, while other companies were still doing their work.\n\nThe waste also was disposed of into smaller containers. Since those containers needed to be held in high temperature-sensitive solutions, a special metal was used to attach the metal to the waste.\n\nAt the time of the excavation, the waste contained around 30,000 barrels of oil and other organic matter, many of which were considered radioactive, according to a study published in the journal Nature Medicine.\n\nIn other words, it's going to be hard to find another way to find it.\n\nThat means experts will have to dig more and more tunnels and dig deeper into the radioactive materials to get their full picture of what the ancient fossilized rock looks like.\n\nA little less than five years ago, the federal government released documents from an archaeological site in northwestern North Carolina that would be the last place the radioactive waste was ever found. This material was located with the help of a robot.\n\nExperts were not able to trace the waste to an actual archaeological site and were unable to identify much of its geological history in a way that could be seen.","token_len":545,"entropy":[7.039,2.1675,6.385,1.5229,1.9843,11.1103,1.3697,0.0035,1.3401,4.5215,5.1664,2.8273,8.0975,0.5018,2.7571,1.0989,1.5312,5.3245,8.0646,1.6485,4.8984,2.7004,1.9158,1.5556,0.2895,0.3427,0.5182,5.9166,8.4991,5.931,2.2141,4.202,4.1671,0.7125,1.2228,7.6542,3.5279,7.7866,4.8923,2.6115,4.7031,11.1053,2.892,8.9194,3.9754,4.7579,5.088,2.378,3.7353,8.9521,4.2378,1.5052,0.0133,0.3237,1.5754,0.0017,2.081,3.9128,2.8575,2.5093,5.4729,1.1254,3.3115,1.1026,2.9799,3.911,2.4318,5.9976,4.9143,3.3376,2.7463,2.1565,5.2712,1.7769,1.0118,1.8162,2.7395,2.7354,2.1043,1.4765,4.9864,1.2769,0.0002,1.2543,3.2671,5.7812,6.0584,4.7167,3.3374,5.1621,4.4779,4.2657,3.1748,0.033,0.3575,6.2243,5.9643,5.2764,5.0485,3.7823,4.3728,4.1041,2.7751,3.1061,4.0168,2.6101,5.6416,0.0257,0.6627,4.1554,5.3394,0.0533,4.6692,2.0198,0.9952,1.0257,0.0003,3.6745,2.3446,1.9098,0.7035,0.8912,1.364,0.4129,1.9142,0.0703,2.3156,2.3949,4.6136,3.6008,2.8371,0.2163,0.6254,3.1166,1.9167,6.1869,0.0107,2.189,4.3118,2.5188,5.9236,1.5932,6.0846,3.9613,1.9939,3.9744,3.0014,1.4543,1.8019,3.1415,5.3483,0.2947,2.0718,3.1594,0.4397,1.881,2.6556,0.0019,2.4778,1.1952,0.5741,2.6795,1.6122,5.5206,0.0093,6.3778,4.6753,1.858,3.2804,4.214,4.8167,1.4103,1.8163,0.282,0.7042,6.2234,0.94,4.6859,4.9355,0.1358,5.2484,0.8186,1.321,1.9744,1.6895,0.172,0.0003,5.1036,2.9478,0.2702,1.3011,3.4489,1.9867,0.0926,6.8105,2.8633,1.5341,3.1813,0.2536,1.1433,4.2632,2.5298,1.0055,6.4977,2.3258,2.651,5.119,2.4435,0.0846,5.5958,1.0616,0.3166,2.1771,1.5273,0.0015,0.0711,0.4743,2.4904,0.0003,2.4172,4.2206,0.3611,5.1082,4.5607,0.0206,1.9417,4.3054,1.4266,2.6527,0.1693,1.674,6.538,3.0759,5.7738,3.4544,0.2949,0.6071,5.8729,3.6371,0.4677,6.3488,1.5335,5.8376,3.2147,1.0292,4.387,0.1998,0.6254,1.4828,0.0003,3.9728,5.4819,2.4249,3.5195,3.5872,5.646,3.8878,6.1576,1.7006,1.3766,3.4156,4.8424,0.4421,1.4345,1.806,0.8117,1.3092,2.1291,4.4709,4.5547,3.2295,5.583,3.4279,0.3038,0.9364,0.0003,1.8112,3.4765,0.9652,0.9616,6.578,2.0389,1.0097,2.6454,2.3855,5.3899,1.2277,1.1165,5.0436,1.475,2.9861,1.5769,3.1357,4.5949,0.8798,2.7456,4.1775,0.0085,1.0108,4.8229,1.2941,2.8132,4.0446,2.1892,0.0649,2.8611,4.0654,1.6927,1.8514,1.8544,4.1909,4.3827,1.9948,1.6329,6.6841,0.1118,0.0003,0.0001,0.6307,6.7468,5.1502,3.5613,2.3612,3.2015,4.4748,2.2547,1.5832,0.5601,0.3797,0.0002,1.4713,2.4415,4.7885,2.4907,4.4412,0.0555,4.3135,6.7131,2.0895,2.4928,5.4688,4.8197,1.1704,6.879,0.4287,0.2627,5.4485,1.2694,5.4771,3.4382,6.272,4.0858,8.3989,0.3963,3.57,3.6032,4.2662,3.2322,0.7743,0.4813,4.7079,0.9544,2.6868,0.6157,0.2858,2.0291,1.0892,0.8186,0.0002,5.0693,0.733,0.7239,1.8501,0.5339,1.6741,0.2124,0.9292,1.971,3.8256,3.9304,3.3606,1.1843,0.0096,4.1718,0.1228,0.7632,2.0677,3.626,6.3915,1.9271,1.2697,5.4034,0.2006,0.2297,1.1306,5.1006,4.2879,2.5799,1.2945,0.0017,2.5396,3.468,1.0294,0.3907,0.6731,0.6426,2.1773,6.034,0.3009,0.3166,0.0002,3.0388,4.2384,0.5902,0.0373,2.6616,2.6151,6.135,0.0819,0.6263,3.3072,0.5068,1.3019,4.8886,2.985,0.1541,1.9923,3.1806,0.6153,0.4605,0.0002,4.9939,3.4694,7.0919,2.3406,0.4568,0.0361,2.7471,3.6881,2.5592,0.2606,3.9898,1.7433,3.7132,2.049,2.0551,0.3934,5.2929,4.2255,2.0345,2.8674,4.2418,7.7009,3.4493,1.418,1.0644,2.8329,5.4212,5.3922,2.0772,5.0046,3.2844,0.0009,0.3341,0.2898,0.0002,4.008,5.7756,3.6981,0.233,3.5078,0.6058,0.7866,0.1949,1.5294,5.8668,0.259,3.6636,5.0189,2.9959,3.3767,4.4541,2.0255,0.702,5.6817,0.512,0.0112,1.3992,4.9491,3.2265,1.8222,3.9249,2.9402,2.8809,4.8888,0.8639,2.0587,3.0422,0.1847,0.2484,5.0609,5.973,1.0888,6.1645,5.6869,0.8866,3.6923,0.0018,1.2743,3.3883,1.9651,0.3225,0.0002,5.4663,3.3685,3.9309,1.7292,0.0042,5.1442,0.5797,4.667,1.2955,3.4701,2.9724,4.5006,0.0385,3.3618,2.7596,1.719,0.0066,2.8784,6.781,0.3239,2.6845,3.8837,1.2326,4.6678,2.7655,1.711,0.2846,1.7456,0.9698,4.5405,4.3407]}
{"id":1043,"ended":true,"length":517,"text":"The two shared an oddly bittersweet moment as they stopped to watch a beautiful sunset... at noon.\n\nThe duo sat together next to a large, massive oak tree just outside of the town, staring at the sky, while they made small talk about their day-dreams.\n\nThey've always been good at being quiet, but now this quiet moment had the effect of letting her know.\n\nIn a small ceremony, both women said they are still learning.\n\nIt was a small ceremony, and the two women weren't worried about their looks. They only started talking when one of them had said they had never seen anything like that before.\n\n\"It was a great night,\" she says. \"It wasn't a perfect night but at least it was a happy night.\"\n\n\"Why did you say you were always always so focused? Maybe I'm too much of a focus and that makes it impossible to be able to focus,\" she says. \"We don't need to focus on what we want to do with our lives.\"\n\nShe has had some moments of concentration, some times to be quiet, where she was able to tell her stories without ever hearing how much she needed to hear them.\n\n\"I have been really hard on myself. I had to let go of my fears because I wanted to do this for my children,\" she says. \"I just want to do what I have been doing for almost 50 years.\"\n\nShe added: \"It was hard working to make the sacrifices I made that I couldn't get back a few years ago. I need to do everything in my power to be the way I want to be.\n\n\"Then this year, I decided it was too soon and made many sacrifices that I wouldn't make for my grandchildren.\"\n\nAs the ceremony passed, they were able to look up and say happy times with their grandchildren.\n\n\"It felt like it was a part of my day just that I wasn't focusing on my problems.\"\n\nWhile they hadn't been given much in the way of tips about life on their own, she says it made it easier to enjoy her life.\n\nShe said they would like to see her husband, and their kids, grow up. She is currently on a four-year support program, which has brought her more attention, because she got a lot of support for her career. She was also going through some tough times, and it's a good thing her husband came to live with her.\n\nShe is grateful for being strong and strong and being loved.

{"id":4819,"ended":true,"length":519,"text":"As part of the new Primary Source Project, you have been selected to be cryogenically preserved so that your specific knowledge will be available for future generations in their hour of utmost need. You've been asleep for 250 years when the leader of the free world thaws you out.\n\nThe most significant technological advances that have ever been made in the discovery of life, or the invention of life, have been made by two different people. It is by one of them that their existence was established. A scientist (Sudwamishthi) started with a knowledge of the universe and the universe system and by the next, the world would make sense. At the same time, a doctor and a scientist (Krishmi) both became conscious and conscious as to themselves about science and the evolution of the human race.\n\nToday there are 6 scientific and theoretical fields in which humanity explores to understand the evolution of mankind. Each one is important because of its impact on the science we live in today. In addition to the scientific field we also have the technological and scientific field.\n\nYou understand our history in the correct ways. The natural phenomenon, the evolution of humanity, the evolutionary process of life, that brought humans to earth has all been made clear using data and our knowledge of ancient history and our historical evolution. In addition to all the human being have been able to understand the evolution of their environment. They have also understood the mechanisms as well as their processes.\n\nBecause of the human being we are at today, we have all understood the natural phenomenon that came about and therefore, we want to understand how it got started. We understand how evolution evolved.\n\nWe would like to thank our friends who help to produce and use the technology in our country. Many of them give the right lessons to our youth.\n\nAt the same time, the most important technologies will surely be utilized in our country for future generations in this field of science. The first is the internet. These devices will help in the preservation of ancient cultures.\n\nFinally, we will continue to help our country with the development of the technological resources it now has. We will develop new technologies and technology in all fields to make society modern and prosperous as well. This will surely lead to a future which will be more beautiful than before.\n\nAs history is not written, the history itself could be rewritten. That is why we should never forget that time as we know it is an important period. This is when history can be turned back at any moment, and a new generation can be born. In which the new humanity will not only be created but also may be transformed. This is the natural evolution of mankind.","token_len":546,"entropy":[6.6379,0.0069,1.2464,4.0784,11.2829,5.5839,5.3657,0.5728,4.002,4.7515,3.3963,5.0104,0.6981,2.5455,16.1765,1.191,0.0323,4.0941,5.5687,0.4044,2.4797,7.6566,7.6242,3.3386,0.6557,3.089,1.7796,1.7305,1.4979,4.7768,5.1105,9.3743,0.1237,11.1035,0.1911,0.2156,3.2126,4.2783,1.0332,13.5338,0.7446,8.2102,0.5113,5.9656,1.4675,10.0379,0.1656,0.5865,4.5779,0.3749,9.5696,1.5684,3.6047,1.1406,2.3302,2.0359,0.0058,2.6163,5.2249,4.4238,6.1583,3.311,2.5269,0.762,3.8142,1.4819,0.7875,1.1274,0.961,8.2736,0.4462,0.9779,2.8585,3.3576,1.8549,4.5336,0.1052,2.3924,1.4917,2.0478,0.9963,2.192,1.6251,6.6156,4.0493,1.6322,1.3532,3.8868,0.8445,5.1949,3.9228,1.1709,1.1217,0.3922,7.9835,5.4272,2.3988,3.779,0.6785,4.7591,4.5086,6.4014,4.6486,5.1013,7.3416,3.8067,3.1066,5.0028,1.1534,0.7497,6.2584,3.8588,1.5783,5.9701,0.3263,1.5607,2.3153,1.4816,2.6136,2.7142,7.4781,2.5544,4.6259,1.679,3.9021,2.8917,3.1749,3.1359,4.2835,6.0214,1.7134,0.7855,4.9167,0.905,0.7058,0.004,0.2124,2.0071,6.2085,4.551,0.7529,1.7967,1.216,2.5506,2.0909,7.5798,0.3809,3.9366,4.0266,5.0144,2.2026,4.9806,4.1056,4.8085,7.3559,5.6872,5.8449,1.0416,2.2473,5.8777,0.0659,1.2366,3.1614,1.0341,0.2346,1.4272,0.0002,4.4556,4.228,0.3543,5.9615,6.2515,3.446,4.9138,3.6857,2.4134,2.6657,4.2163,8.1854,4.6995,3.0846,0.7739,4.2608,0.1043,4.9144,0.8376,4.0655,2.6349,1.6,4.9457,2.4616,2.0074,0.5175,3.879,0.2579,1.0803,5.5418,5.1206,4.1081,1.6706,1.6658,0.3828,3.4364,3.3127,1.0912,1.5651,2.0826,1.7655,4.4015,4.3301,1.2679,1.4286,3.2082,3.9084,2.7622,1.096,1.3431,1.7102,0.0002,4.4233,6.0932,4.6741,4.0397,3.5092,1.8918,7.2586,3.8831,0.9144,2.7473,5.5189,5.5842,3.4858,0.998,2.8225,0.119,3.6573,0.7588,1.8417,5.8056,1.1533,1.0797,1.9375,0.9865,4.9931,5.4031,4.5554,0.7892,3.9245,2.9962,3.7946,0.406,4.1411,6.0084,8.0036,5.0075,1.6813,4.8588,1.3649,1.2223,6.0396,1.5075,2.4629,2.8549,5.3211,5.2921,0.3209,3.4982,2.5268,1.2895,3.1702,2.1042,5.4477,6.4553,5.1878,1.0348,3.7421,0.0218,1.9187,1.1321,1.8774,0.1422,3.4352,3.0405,1.7872,3.149,0.8395,2.5609,2.9636,0.8791,5.0819,6.808,0.9742,0.6006,2.9782,4.6849,1.1052,1.1643,0.0001,5.4151,0.6829,1.5175,4.4602,1.8001,4.0346,1.6537,4.7822,7.0331,1.2163,1.2477,1.4596,3.9952,5.1135,0.989,3.1154,3.101,2.4215,5.1431,0.5869,3.7282,5.6526,2.304,1.3525,5.5846,0.139,1.6219,2.2332,1.6637,5.0012,1.1006,0.8263,1.7994,3.6139,1.929,3.4637,3.9278,1.797,1.9206,0.0001,2.0826,5.9413,0.3284,0.14,4.8693,3.3464,3.0532,2.6943,5.1394,3.0855,4.9569,3.1343,4.1593,1.4079,3.5887,3.0018,1.7371,2.6846,0.6838,5.1873,0.7564,0.8221,5.7833,3.5344,5.4424,6.0984,1.3344,1.9429,4.3542,1.0549,1.4109,0.0002,5.4752,0.7866,1.1491,0.0059,0.3523,2.7309,4.8127,0.2661,5.1308,4.8984,6.9149,1.3193,4.5828,1.4455,1.2286,0.4417,3.4036,2.2238,0.2134,3.9633,4.4195,2.1196,2.4807,1.3727,0.6839,2.8139,3.7374,3.4407,1.0755,4.2718,0.9408,4.9552,3.6682,1.135,2.7611,3.7986,1.4378,5.8815,0.2058,4.6969,4.5977,1.7461,1.4873,0.0002,5.6002,0.0894,1.1808,2.3671,3.6405,0.4973,4.7863,2.1699,1.8143,2.9945,1.3779,1.5061,0.0777,1.8335,4.5199,5.5258,5.7111,6.864,1.0774,0.3664,1.754,0.9417,3.7239,2.7326,0.7293,2.0016,3.4356,2.6537,4.43,1.425,3.2775,2.5689,5.094,6.0368,1.0328,3.544,4.6814,0.7165,2.3118,3.9776,1.2878,6.4058,3.3247,0.0966,1.6551,3.9923,4.2945,0.9953,1.274,3.0463,4.6658,1.5646,3.41,0.2957,0.2952,0.0002,3.9816,8.4077,2.2729,3.9547,2.5242,2.0222,2.674,3.4373,6.5742,5.8594,1.3945,2.0504,1.0404,4.6394,0.529,0.5083,0.9595,4.8637,4.3607,0.9976,1.6027,6.0031,5.305,1.6102,1.2849,0.0334,1.5606,5.1923,1.3446,2.5493,1.5634,3.7524,1.0404,5.2377,3.4586,3.6037,0.7693,5.3303,2.806,5.5113,1.4685,0.6779,2.9184,2.0326,4.5257,1.4168,3.3347,1.3916,1.5556,0.7999,0.5419,4.4984,6.3218,3.3907,4.6865,4.3831,1.0822,4.4243,1.1831,1.4959,3.3421,1.8426,1.3465,5.6858,1.4198,3.1545,1.3454,3.0157,0.8979,1.3613,6.2451,2.9766,0.2702,1.6553,0.473]}
{"id":4522,"ended":true,"length":504,"text":"A burglar enters a home by forcing the window open. Upon stepping through the window frame, heavy steel curtains cover all windows and doors leading to the outside, lights turn on, and the words `` Player 2 has entered the game '' echo around the house.\n\nThe second player, who is a burglar, breaks a window by entering the house. A large black box, containing a computer and a television, is then captured, and the second person then runs.\n\nThe third person, who is a burglar, runs away with a blue box, and the fourth person then goes down the cellar wall into the attic.\n\nThe fourth person, who is described as a burglar, is described as a burglar, but is described only as `` the second person'' who got caught.\n\nThe fifth person has not been seen in years as he attempts to gain access to the front of the house - there was no sign of him until the day before the whole incident happened.\n\n\"He was walking around with a gun in the middle of the night and was trying to steal something,\" Police Chief John Breen said. \"A moment later he went into the house by the stairs and got out through the windows. He then started shooting.\"\n\nWhen police arrived on the scene, he was still hiding in the basement, Breen said. But police learned that the man behind the house heard shots coming from outside and immediately ran toward their apartment.\n\nThe fourth person ran out the door at another time and turned toward the home and entered through the back window of the building. When police returned, they also found the fourth person in the front room.\n\nHe broke glass on both sides of the door between the front and the second bedroom. The fourth person ran from the kitchen and the second bedroom and into the basement into the basement. They also heard multiple gunshots fired from inside the building, police said. The first person left the house early on Oct. 25 and had no recollection about running.\n\nThe fifth person is described as a burglar but can see the rear window of the house. He walked out after seeing the second person running and ran into the basement.\n\n\"The person that stole in the next instant is now out trying to get in, he's wearing black clothing to disguise himself through the front door,\" Breen said.\n\nPolice have given up the key to the house.

{"id":4626,"ended":true,"length":499,"text":"`` They needed a pep talk ''' - Pashinyan\n\nAfter speaking with Armenian President Lenny Komen, the country\u2019s leader, Lenny Komen (COP-YS, Armenian: \u30d1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u30c4) said that Armenia had no choice but to accept the peace offer.\n\n\"The Armenian state will accept the peace offer from the Armenian government and make Armenia our permanent capital,\" Pashinyan said.\n\nHe later said that \"the present negotiations between two parties were only for the sake of the political issue of Armenia, that is, the peace offer and the negotiations for Armenia as a whole. This will not be a political one nor has there been any talk about the political settlement of the issue. \"\n\nThe Armenian President added that his country is ready to join the peace talks and that \"the issue of the Armenian nation will continue even after all the talks in Washington. I would like to assure that Armenia will give full consideration to all the resolutions of the peace talks.\"\n\nAs usual, the Armenian President\u2019s remarks about how Armenia responded to Lenny Komen's request were met with the protests that arose from many within the Armenian community.\n\n\"Why would we change our position? Why do we not go there? Why do we not discuss the economic issue with other countries? Why do we allow terrorists from West to build in Armenia? Who will help Armenia build its new infrastructure? Why do we not allow our own government to build a new national center?\" said Komen\n\n\"Those who are involved in the negotiations will know that this is a serious issue. It is not only for the sake of this issue, so many are involved in the negotiations. These issues are really the issues which are getting involved. It\u2019s my understanding that the Armenian state of mind has said that this is too serious now, because the talks are just for the sake of the political issue.\" stated Komen\n\n\"The people are tired of the same. They are tired of fighting. They are tired of fighting. Now we want to see the process for putting an end to the problems in Armenia and we are ready to come home for an Armenian wedding. But it is time to go.\" said Karen Stenner, a lawyer, who was a part of the meeting.\n\nKomen insisted that both nations remain very serious about the peace agreement and that \"we can continue our efforts to bring peace to Armenia\"\n\n\u2018The past and future of Armenia should not be about the past. On the contrary, the future of the country should end up very much with our political future,\u2019 declared Pashinyan.","token_len":549,"entropy":[7.4811,6.6989,1.8706,7.9632,3.6988,0.3133,7.4149,8.1119,5.3527,6.421,8.3354,4.1958,1.4018,2.2265,0.0115,5.956,6.2772,0.7138,8.7048,2.2428,5.9843,5.609,2.4168,7.2356,1.0593,2.4828,5.4982,12.9815,8.217,1.8383,3.2578,1.6353,4.5657,0.8264,1.6872,0.0698,5.554,4.5053,8.4465,3.6349,10.806,4.0876,2.5748,5.6447,8.6748,2.9626,3.3094,3.7997,3.0442,3.7187,2.4062,2.439,1.3071,2.5606,2.6428,3.3752,2.7186,0.0883,0.0134,2.9477,1.1859,5.9097,2.8144,2.2791,0.8762,0.0006,1.6334,2.3728,2.0233,5.1631,2.6937,2.4756,0.8657,1.1225,0.3236,2.5542,0.9731,2.4346,1.6996,2.0238,5.2797,4.8118,3.9286,4.1343,2.7398,0.9318,6.1392,0.0095,0.0003,0.0005,0.5006,0.6673,0.4058,0.0002,2.7371,5.1206,1.8273,0.4753,3.8423,1.7389,6.6461,4.7733,3.498,6.2582,2.4209,3.2743,4.4684,3.5312,1.1195,1.5052,0.0042,1.5367,4.8328,5.3244,1.4589,3.0564,2.4653,3.1771,0.7151,1.451,1.5867,3.1074,2.1912,3.1469,0.8342,4.3889,2.9669,4.2953,4.2325,1.1587,0.4884,1.8585,3.4095,3.8641,1.3178,1.1663,1.8219,1.9595,5.6897,5.789,6.0478,3.1756,0.1589,0.2688,4.8357,1.5367,1.1769,1.8079,4.0687,0.7407,0.6063,1.4799,2.4723,3.8058,0.4313,0.0002,2.4363,1.5444,2.2539,3.4663,0.1785,3.7743,0.6818,2.932,1.6848,0.1935,4.8002,0.3943,1.4206,1.3355,1.7431,1.6994,2.6049,1.5917,4.1328,0.5901,1.3994,1.5425,4.1161,2.4662,3.4379,6.0459,1.4384,3.9736,0.8131,3.0618,3.5205,5.1212,3.4645,4.4106,3.7471,0.32,0.2004,3.2925,2.6868,1.6556,0.8738,5.8431,2.6308,1.8191,0.1566,1.3806,0.8494,5.3856,1.0897,0.261,4.1807,1.1583,2.3848,0.1714,0.0002,4.6087,5.0743,0.1356,1.6167,1.6295,1.1417,7.8369,0.2278,0.0235,3.091,5.1063,6.3386,2.3227,7.0602,0.4357,5.6994,0.0878,0.2187,0.0008,1.2534,4.8017,1.3976,1.9484,0.0827,4.1283,7.2415,3.4079,4.7737,1.0779,5.2349,5.7403,0.4605,0.8408,0.4717,0.5629,0.4055,0.0002,2.2075,5.0566,3.5036,2.3974,5.3849,0.5465,2.733,2.4117,1.6069,2.8992,0.2276,1.9714,4.7421,4.4299,1.4292,1.1709,1.1019,0.1269,0.7494,4.9645,1.0064,5.9574,2.4332,2.6814,4.4419,0.8944,1.0408,0.8948,0.5924,0.0841,6.4293,6.6961,3.3287,7.9579,4.6752,7.7456,4.0463,0.7658,1.3656,5.6569,2.6194,3.814,5.134,3.7785,2.3986,3.761,3.3857,1.097,1.6389,0.8997,0.1937,0.945,2.6005,3.3239,3.0509,3.78,0.2725,2.8167,2.6113,1.8611,4.6195,3.6785,2.2856,3.0192,3.7963,0.0451,5.284,0.0001,2.1238,5.6124,0.8038,2.1143,4.4591,0.3954,1.0044,3.5533,3.4889,4.0439,0.5936,2.7834,0.7318,1.3411,3.2035,1.243,1.6907,2.5384,0.5996,1.6049,2.1618,1.9933,0.5841,0.2027,0.0013,5.0132,1.0685,0.9074,5.864,3.7213,3.4574,4.5706,0.5252,1.1409,1.2132,1.4852,4.1319,4.7131,1.0404,5.23,3.151,4.0708,2.7555,1.8643,5.3531,4.4901,2.3751,2.6666,11.1374,0.2871,0.0204,5.5046,3.9229,0.1142,1.5444,1.466,3.798,5.6659,2.9462,2.9331,6.2432,0.7509,2.4394,0.6927,6.0298,1.5532,6.4871,2.0653,3.3444,2.0141,4.3794,1.0111,4.2838,1.4083,0.384,0.035,0.0027,0.7181,1.0557,0.3672,2.438,7.8974,0.8855,0.0024,1.1373,0.0001,1.2832,2.1777,4.3606,2.7577,3.9206,0.1411,1.6189,5.4156,4.651,1.2114,1.3096,0.6384,0.0265,4.9162,2.6463,0.5291,0.6124,0.1072,0.0175,2.7489,2.4189,4.451,2.2008,3.2547,0.4046,3.0769,1.6356,5.714,4.2436,6.9542,1.6464,0.0059,0.0059,1.1945,4.6016,2.627,0.7834,2.0698,3.8116,1.9105,1.2359,0.2233,4.6885,5.6394,3.8625,4.6448,2.2945,5.6739,1.4244,3.5428,3.1441,0.771,3.6341,0.9626,2.8059,5.6693,1.69,7.6314,5.8528,5.1977,5.2979,1.0136,2.3233,4.6123,3.432,2.1191,2.1794,3.7969,2.9683,0.1058,0.3006,3.6657,0.9699,0.1946,0.0002,2.6836,0.4041,6.1601,0.1179,5.8255,6.1746,4.7761,6.3116,3.9955,0.5654,0.9923,2.51,3.6589,1.3374,0.8841,3.5459,2.4887,3.5541,2.5768,3.1023,2.7976,1.0116,3.1862,1.205,0.5201,0.8274,3.7527,1.9255,0.0002,5.9444,5.8916,4.5061,6.8994,4.5113,1.4491,0.4009,1.4012,4.3919,1.6269,0.4724,5.8376,1.6341,2.5304,1.2168,5.5355,0.458,0.9005,0.1265,1.7773,1.5912,0.396,1.6547,1.655,0.6163,7.2744,3.0952,6.5335,1.7519,2.3626,3.2517,5.2842,4.8776,2.1791,7.4468,0.6624,6.9137,2.4807,0.0095,0.0007,0.0009,0.6215]}
{"id":1779,"ended":false,"length":523,"text":"As an integral part of the Worldwide Afterlife Program of the far future, new technology allows for the deceased to remain as a visible `` ghost '' on Earth for a year and a day before they disappear forever.\n\nThe most significant technological breakthrough is the ability of our bodies to 'be present' before the world is known, and this is a fact that was first presented in the early 20th century as well as by the human population in the 1900s. Scientists at the time believed that we could live without the body for a year and a day before the real world would make sense. They were right.\n\nOne of the most influential technologies of the 20th century was the 'time machine' which allowed us to see past the human life cycle to the time that we are now and allow us to view ourselves on the screen to see how our lives progress today.\n\nThe technology of time travel is the application of quantum mechanics to our everyday world. It has also provided us with a number of exciting opportunities, and is now in the field of cosmology, which may have been more than known. The technology allows us to see that our body is in fact a living form, or that we have no body, but rather, that we are simply living on earth, and that we are able to make decisions based purely on the basis of the information we obtain in our bodies.\n\nIt has been proven that we have a living soul at all times, and there is a huge volume of research being done both in the laboratory and on the internet. There are many applications of time travel. Some research in this field involves the creation of the ultimate world, and therefore the potential to create a 'natural world\".\n\nThere are certainly many other research fields that are similar, and include the understanding of time travel, the creation of time-travel and other technologies. We are so sure of knowing this, that it is almost as though the technology could be applied to real-life events, and the results can be used to help make better decisions and improve our lives now and into the future.\n\nTo be true to the spirit of the modernist, we need to start taking all options at one time, so as to ensure that we are at the earliest opportunity to explore what might be possible.\n\nOur journey would be much easier if we would start to explore every possibility we have. Although there are many challenges related to the technology, we at the company, and the people who make us the company, have made an incredible effort to try and make any possible adjustments as much as we can to preserve our souls, so that we are at the latest on the latest technology.\n\nThe future here is bright!","token_len":551,"entropy":[5.0725,7.7641,0.123,0.017,0.9957,10.7376,10.9599,2.6298,2.6794,4.3439,0.7028,11.8465,5.5603,0.438,7.9223,4.6872,4.2171,2.7515,1.6019,11.4303,0.2261,4.3603,4.5153,1.6348,6.9787,14.5629,10.8283,1.9807,3.679,2.0604,1.1573,1.8663,4.4259,2.755,0.6998,3.0111,4.142,1.883,4.9102,4.2205,0.3732,2.145,0.012,1.8912,5.1548,3.4325,4.218,1.2333,2.5325,0.9427,3.5727,1.9548,4.6595,3.9575,0.0863,5.5316,4.3808,5.0623,1.764,5.6469,2.2055,4.919,2.0334,4.9878,2.4873,2.1249,2.7173,1.6113,2.8703,5.3969,0.8042,4.2899,4.0523,6.0865,1.2057,1.11,2.4548,2.1155,0.0119,0.1583,3.2038,3.9832,0.1652,3.3089,1.5714,5.4732,4.3204,1.8753,0.4166,5.1053,0.2946,0.3262,5.2901,3.4999,0.7737,2.9534,2.1777,0.1886,3.8198,1.2717,3.8534,4.1736,1.9538,3.4088,2.5896,1.9193,1.2042,0.9474,0.0879,0.1247,1.7471,2.2264,5.1989,0.6774,2.9156,6.2962,1.9853,0.5993,4.1272,2.8005,2.213,0.7393,1.2518,0.0004,4.9564,0.5778,0.0681,1.1888,5.0461,4.9674,1.8078,0.3635,0.9142,0.0064,0.0627,0.5485,0.4349,3.8783,5.5011,1.5315,1.3266,1.542,1.4848,1.136,0.0565,3.5798,2.9337,1.4482,3.4573,4.8945,2.0779,3.6048,1.7034,3.5286,3.0381,0.8106,1.7334,1.5477,5.2955,5.0833,0.8813,0.0509,5.0151,3.7201,4.3582,1.1544,4.9569,4.9277,1.6451,2.4348,2.0887,1.6507,6.429,6.2677,0.247,1.191,0.0002,1.6385,4.0427,1.599,1.6802,1.4781,1.8196,3.0377,6.4452,0.0407,3.3724,1.4995,0.6152,2.849,2.2794,4.3069,1.0458,2.0626,2.9084,4.8451,4.0475,1.1387,0.0905,1.6183,4.4268,0.0011,4.059,2.7688,2.7069,3.5369,3.0157,1.8572,3.6304,1.7537,4.9294,0.0156,6.5072,0.0315,1.8956,2.6785,4.8896,3.2303,2.257,4.1405,2.6017,10.3825,2.8771,3.023,3.3213,4.0824,0.3428,0.0379,1.7917,4.381,1.7364,4.222,0.8385,3.3609,1.044,2.3255,2.7262,5.1515,1.388,4.6384,2.4677,1.3745,2.35,4.232,2.1516,2.2169,1.8154,1.6741,2.9817,1.4833,0.5313,0.6642,3.668,1.4792,2.475,4.1473,1.9591,1.7424,1.0094,0.95,0.7519,4.0611,0.0237,4.3098,4.3038,2.3808,5.5725,0.1414,1.7715,6.4983,0.0364,1.9815,3.0493,0.7509,5.0011,3.2239,1.3792,1.1451,0.2904,0.455,0.0002,3.6738,2.4472,1.1239,4.4221,0.447,2.8474,2.321,1.8433,4.0388,3.3728,4.491,2.7913,0.0546,0.9125,0.7776,4.4801,0.6802,1.8677,3.8689,6.818,0.0428,2.2092,2.4304,0.5228,7.4414,1.4537,1.1063,3.8709,0.3116,1.8811,0.5274,3.0418,1.5527,3.5264,0.9615,1.4481,4.2013,1.2734,2.1463,0.0567,3.5972,4.1445,4.7632,3.4447,2.0766,0.8444,3.0966,2.075,3.2841,0.0451,4.4089,5.1654,6.1559,1.6879,1.7188,5.8358,1.907,4.2512,1.6663,2.3892,1.2443,3.1222,6.529,2.244,8.9189,0.7018,0.0002,3.3333,0.5743,6.2925,1.2221,2.6302,5.9713,3.7699,1.1888,1.3918,5.8464,2.3833,1.3935,6.6646,1.8254,5.3633,0.1373,2.808,0.1849,0.8986,1.7647,2.8261,0.0505,3.2568,2.7826,2.1718,4.2931,2.9103,2.9638,1.3097,3.1977,1.6138,5.4573,5.5173,1.5298,6.5109,3.3891,1.5011,0.5471,2.7738,0.5461,3.8043,2.4392,2.667,2.4668,4.0106,4.6722,0.9637,1.3283,0.3625,5.4187,1.9213,0.8293,2.2755,1.6121,1.4551,2.9628,4.361,4.0848,0.3522,2.5477,0.3962,2.6863,3.9341,3.7101,0.6729,2.5981,2.6693,1.409,0.2975,6.9106,1.4162,4.0065,0.0467,0.0432,0.1026,0.2874,0.0002,4.7373,3.1844,6.859,0.4678,1.2607,2.3765,0.1371,1.216,5.4879,6.1187,3.0055,2.1068,2.1557,0.3175,4.5908,4.7699,4.8295,7.2589,5.2779,5.8197,0.7373,1.169,3.9702,2.6997,0.3546,3.4545,0.3159,1.1641,1.5326,4.8559,0.6661,6.2304,5.0426,0.3479,5.1017,3.7855,3.647,0.4572,0.8979,1.4455,1.229,0.0002,4.5026,5.2842,5.4359,1.486,3.3819,2.4029,0.2476,0.2855,3.4306,3.3183,3.5354,3.118,5.545,2.2686,2.9659,1.038,1.89,6.2584,2.3284,0.6421,0.6548,5.0549,6.1816,0.0256,1.8619,3.2776,0.7322,1.5088,5.6814,1.114,6.8775,3.2554,3.0462,1.8391,2.3182,2.2652,2.9611,3.6797,4.1084,1.0798,0.4774,1.5495,2.921,4.2159,2.5061,1.3998,0.5071,4.0528,1.1754,1.9051,6.5385,1.1671,6.6024,2.7785,3.7175,0.0503,2.2241,0.2349,2.1087,6.0437,1.7404,7.0302,2.1437,3.2163,0.6891,0.5462,2.4338,2.7666,0.1953,5.5373,3.0048,1.2248,3.5226,1.6892,0.9871,0.464,0.0002,2.6428,3.116,6.6766,0.6498,2.0645,2.8558]}
{"id":4012,"ended":true,"length":520,"text":"You live in a society where at the end of each day, you can choose to relive it, but without retaining any knowledge of what happened previously. A number in your peripheral vision shows how many previous times you lived through the current day. Almost always that number is 0. Today it is 7212.\n\nThe second part is that the first part of our society that we associate with being able to relive the past, while being a subject that was not present in our previous lifetime.\n\nIn the present moment there are no fewer than 24 persons living at the time of writing. By the time we can be reminded who those 24 individuals were, these are 24 persons.\n\nIt is also important to mention and remind yourself that 24 of these 24 individuals were present in the present day.\n\nSo the number of the 25 persons that were present in the present day has not only a great scope as to what happened to them, but its significance to history has become greater.\n\nA recent study of human consciousness found that during the period that they were experiencing the present world in which we live, the individuals that were in this existence were able to identify with the past in more than 100 specific ways.\n\nThe results that followed revealed that in fact these individuals were able or able to learn what happened to themselves and to what they were doing in the present world. It also revealed that they were able to connect with the past, while remaining present in what was in fact their future.\n\nThe main points of my research are as follows. On the one hand, it is very helpful that we remember that 24 persons are of this sort. On the other, when we do remember the past in terms of their future, it will help to remember that 24 persons are in fact a part of the past that were not present in our previous lifetime.\n\nThe third part is that 24 persons experienced the present situation in their past life, but without being able to relive it. On the other hand, a significant part of what they had experienced can be achieved. When they reflect on the present life they can see that the time for the present was indeed now, and that it is no longer what they had lived in prior to the present day, but even if they do not recollect it. In fact this is true of all eternity.

{"id":3432,"ended":true,"length":520,"text":"You live in a society where at the end of each day, you can choose to relive it, but without retaining any knowledge of what happened previously. A number in your peripheral vision shows how many previous times you lived through the current day. Almost always that number is 0. Today it is 7212.\n\nThe second part is that the first part of our society that we associate with being able to relive the past, while being a subject that was not present in our previous lifetime.\n\nIn the present moment there are no fewer than 24 persons living at the time of writing. By the time we can be reminded who those 24 individuals were, these are 24 persons.\n\nIt is also important to mention and remind yourself that 24 of these 24 individuals were present in the present day.\n\nSo the number of the 25 persons that were present in the present day has not only a great scope as to what happened to them, but its significance to history has become greater.\n\nA recent study of human consciousness found that during the period that they were experiencing the present world in which we live, the individuals that were in this existence were able to identify with the past in more than 100 specific ways.\n\nThe results that followed revealed that in fact these individuals were able or able to learn what happened to themselves and to what they were doing in the present world. It also revealed that they were able to connect with the past, while remaining present in what was in fact their future.\n\nThe main points of my research are as follows. On the one hand, it is very helpful that we remember that 24 persons are of this sort. On the other, when we do remember the past in terms of their future, it will help to remember that 24 persons are in fact a part of the past that were not present in our previous lifetime.\n\nThe third part is that 24 persons experienced the present situation in their past life, but without being able to relive it. On the other hand, a significant part of what they had experienced can be achieved. When they reflect on the present life they can see that the time for the present was indeed now, and that it is no longer what they had lived in prior to the present day, but even if they do not recollect it. In fact this is true of all eternity. Even during history it can be attained through the process of remembrance.\n\nSo it is very important that we believe that 24 persons are actually an part of the past.\n\nIf you would like to share any ideas and tips that you would like to discuss with us, please do so on our website and email us at info@lilacomputerservices.net.","token_len":553,"entropy":[6.9476,0.4318,1.4643,4.8112,0.6007,6.7784,2.3916,1.432,0.0323,3.9905,1.0249,1.173,1.5902,2.5539,3.5277,1.0224,9.4164,0.0611,3.3456,2.2012,2.1622,6.2985,9.5243,2.219,4.0656,0.6904,1.5479,1.4202,7.953,0.947,5.0222,6.0283,7.681,2.4141,9.8808,0.1702,6.1105,3.7949,4.0462,6.7649,4.9939,0.6715,4.4067,3.2994,1.6242,5.8196,2.4563,0.7739,8.0848,3.8701,5.0079,5.1186,0.9061,5.5457,0.8905,8.0853,3.2362,0.5742,7.8319,9.2291,0.8231,1.6343,0.0141,2.7323,4.5277,3.2195,2.6993,1.814,2.524,5.2451,0.8156,1.3134,3.8755,4.6692,4.6332,1.3694,6.0297,0.0767,3.9685,3.5204,0.0057,3.5128,0.0031,2.0076,0.8273,2.5433,5.1112,3.9173,4.0104,6.4925,2.7341,4.5651,2.6067,2.8777,1.373,1.9041,3.6799,4.4099,2.4514,1.9939,0.0002,3.0651,1.9676,4.0877,3.2086,4.0524,1.173,2.9597,7.4981,0.1567,5.0987,6.1046,2.8446,3.5388,1.1256,2.471,0.4557,5.0266,1.0316,5.4506,1.9879,0.7402,1.7591,4.402,4.3111,4.7197,5.7464,4.1357,1.3034,3.648,1.2574,0.7728,5.3279,2.9317,4.1059,2.5359,2.3167,1.1647,0.0002,3.6966,0.5052,3.4813,1.2542,0.1562,4.4776,6.8506,4.7295,2.3205,0.6084,4.804,3.9756,1.0752,2.092,1.7617,1.7888,3.962,1.2173,0.9978,1.4585,1.6693,0.8716,1.3055,0.0001,3.1955,3.5788,3.5195,0.4785,4.9313,5.7254,1.9812,2.2504,1.8881,0.669,0.6246,0.2721,0.5886,0.4144,4.4958,3.1894,4.3448,3.4939,4.7013,7.5462,5.0548,1.3047,1.391,2.1047,2.2777,0.4588,0.9554,0.2265,5.2686,3.6057,3.2689,5.5771,6.0515,3.5561,3.4254,0.6324,0.4097,0.0002,4.3079,4.9792,1.0792,2.7972,5.3827,5.4713,3.1487,0.1411,4.9324,0.8414,3.4926,3.9206,4.037,0.7327,5.6515,1.3241,1.3747,4.156,3.8248,3.2044,2.7663,1.4035,0.2372,2.1329,5.3172,1.6718,0.8225,3.2639,3.2833,7.1964,1.4657,3.4856,0.0098,4.5242,1.5258,1.3379,1.8883,3.3341,4.8386,1.728,3.665,5.5717,0.1275,0.3314,0.3691,0.0002,2.2743,4.047,5.1453,5.7987,4.4123,0.3633,3.5057,3.806,3.766,0.3243,1.0378,0.3981,10.695,2.5667,0.1635,5.2977,4.134,1.3554,0.5662,6.3284,2.232,1.9801,5.1866,2.1838,1.6812,2.1963,1.1845,0.674,0.4239,2.1777,0.7052,4.7402,3.583,0.9955,0.2579,1.9267,0.7644,0.2008,0.0739,4.8493,0.8103,1.6913,0.7275,3.1394,4.225,4.3629,3.7871,1.0246,5.1948,1.8534,3.7032,2.2285,2.9867,3.2232,0.6895,0.2631,0.0002,2.193,5.8143,4.6123,1.2728,4.9457,2.7186,1.5381,2.6567,0.0396,1.4257,7.9376,0.8232,0.4038,0.0151,0.5107,2.5807,0.9085,3.3313,4.2518,2.663,1.6434,3.5863,2.6392,4.6589,1.8462,2.0507,6.4624,2.5278,5.7386,1.1672,0.9954,0.0047,0.0078,3.0114,4.3775,0.5316,3.8537,1.8064,2.4834,2.0913,2.5733,4.0195,0.0148,3.5407,3.5485,1.4697,1.9681,3.8768,2.4956,2.4904,1.5052,1.4787,1.9533,0.6881,0.8549,3.1944,1.0762,4.6692,2.4568,0.0138,1.2343,2.3038,2.6808,4.2154,1.7212,0.4278,0.3628,1.5106,1.5088,2.0577,0.1375,0.2731,0.0002,2.4034,4.2399,1.3081,1.1578,0.338,2.8029,0.3166,7.4095,1.4912,1.2583,5.1634,0.864,3.0055,2.3315,1.5297,2.1233,2.4023,4.0572,2.551,0.5106,0.0128,2.2385,0.009,0.8909,0.9671,5.0699,0.1396,0.3723,0.0247,0.1178,4.8318,4.3018,2.1011,0.0593,3.8641,1.6868,3.6185,0.8874,5.4957,0.4137,8.1344,4.648,4.7662,1.4444,6.6559,0.484,1.5627,1.3016,2.8799,3.0413,1.3851,2.439,0.5989,2.3822,4.7295,4.1291,4.1568,1.7137,2.4326,4.4246,5.904,1.5953,1.4956,0.9703,2.3743,1.7041,3.745,0.0581,4.3771,1.3759,0.9894,4.4013,2.0152,2.5475,0.505,1.3393,0.3498,1.9269,2.6031,0.4275,6.8195,2.324,0.772,2.7612,0.3312,4.8528,0.0001,1.6543,2.4143,4.2098,2.4511,3.6449,1.1484,4.5303,1.6618,1.8291,8.0982,0.7188,5.7477,5.1539,7.9985,3.0813,2.3389,0.4326,5.5298,2.422,1.614,3.6064,0.0401,5.0802,0.4958,0.3347,0.0002,3.1005,2.9957,0.3272,2.62,0.6502,0.8046,0.3535,7.5746,0.431,1.4396,0.1739,1.3429,4.4518,5.2818,5.251,0.0031,0.4809,0.7152,2.2063,1.0561,0.0002,3.5566,1.9514,3.2466,0.0411,0.0974,3.4988,4.5306,4.7801,3.1772,5.4743,2.0593,1.4692,1.8654,0.0506,0.1926,6.345,1.0345,1.7693,0.698,0.6124,2.4113,0.3373,2.3948,0.9018,3.9742,2.9635,3.8003,1.2002,0.6938,2.7687,0.0534,4.9442,5.223,3.3218,4.2856,5.4377,5.4413,0.511,0.0458,2.6631,0.3932]}
{"id":1815,"ended":false,"length":475,"text":"The Secret Life of a Casul Meth User\n\nThe book The Secret Life of a Casul Meth User (or Meth User, sometimes commonly referred to as the \"Secret Life\" of a Casul Meth User) (1914) is a book by Joseph A. Knecht published in 1934; the book begins with a story on the origin and nature of Casul Meth, and continues with stories and articles examining its scientific and scientific implications, including the development of new and related drugs.\n\nSynopsis\nIn the book, J.E. Knecht takes on the story of a Casul Meth User, and his relationship to Casul Meth, as they enter a different world of research in his lifetime and examine a variety of science. The book also includes biographical details about Knecht's wife Mary Ann and his son John.\n\nIn Knecht's novel, Joseph A. Knecht refers to the beginning of the Casul Meth life cycle as a time warp in which DNA could be transferred and then passed on to the same person. Joseph A. Knecht describes the origins of Casul Meth as \"...something which you just learned was the origin of life...\" in his novel.\nIn his book, Knecht discusses his early interest in science, although this appears to be limited to those topics pertaining to the human body and to the medical treatment of Casul Meth, but also concerns the development of new drugs. Knecht relates the history and story that follows the formation and end-of-life effects of Casul Meth and subsequent discoveries of new and related drug candidates. In his book, Knecht describes the influence of science on Casul Meth and describes many potential drug candidates to which the author is referencing, including all the drugs currently approved for use. Knecht also mentions the development of the Casul Meth drug development process and the potential for new drug candidates to be approved.\n\nFor the first portion of the book, Knecht talks about Casul Meth in the same terms which are used by scientists who may have similar stories during history. In the second part of the book, Knecht deals with topics that affect Casul Meth as he relates his personal lives and experiences. This section of the book is devoted to the beginnings of Casul Meth, and focuses on Knecht's relationship to Casul Meth, after he is aware that there is a world of researchers who can relate to the story of Casul Meth. The book concludes with Knecht's reflections on how Casul Meth may have different stories.\n\nSee also\n Scientific discovery\n Human physiology\n Casul Meth\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Casul Meth User Encyclopedia","token_len":554,"entropy":[9.391,3.2017,0.1379,4.3311,10.2232,8.7846,14.9629,10.7053,1.4926,0.0262,2.5042,6.0008,3.9172,0.0521,0.0081,0.0012,0.0689,0.0259,0.0007,0.0161,0.1895,3.1685,6.0074,7.9734,3.6551,2.8074,5.168,6.211,1.3884,0.0043,0.0754,1.5272,1.2416,3.4561,0.3353,2.2883,1.4594,0.5955,0.6371,0.0065,0.0643,0.5929,0.4574,5.7796,2.917,4.8539,0.2549,1.7465,1.1347,3.3133,2.1117,4.5972,4.7681,0.0758,5.3085,4.5188,1.1329,4.2052,0.744,4.1771,6.4259,2.1916,1.3127,5.2284,0.5777,1.0184,3.6822,5.4748,1.345,5.1489,2.2987,3.8996,0.0042,2.6349,0.0303,0.3297,1.2773,1.7468,3.0945,0.8354,4.908,3.1509,5.236,7.6436,3.3129,4.5807,1.4356,3.317,4.7508,2.581,2.122,1.4177,3.8735,0.1868,3.9412,3.1952,6.9435,2.1401,1.5521,1.6461,0.0002,7.6277,0.414,18.2545,1.6439,3.5186,0.5361,6.4785,0.4492,4.0697,0.0079,2.7345,0.0424,0.0001,4.6245,2.6065,0.4236,5.9233,0.0794,1.4423,2.1053,0.0096,0.047,2.4288,1.7436,3.0174,3.4454,4.0936,1.1743,3.8695,0.0188,0.2176,1.8724,2.6657,3.6937,4.6546,1.536,5.5592,0.7984,2.1679,5.9418,3.2708,4.3162,6.0939,3.7896,6.5337,4.0671,3.4647,0.0014,4.7596,2.1658,1.714,0.9966,2.8406,2.0768,7.1835,0.9251,2.3528,2.0327,1.5325,0.0274,0.0001,1.5884,4.3263,4.6034,3.0539,2.8043,1.8012,3.6069,3.0728,1.6819,0.9595,0.0002,2.5759,4.8905,0.0121,0.0002,0.0288,4.3662,0.4854,3.6429,0.6973,0.0081,0.0097,0.0071,0.0001,6.7765,0.0418,1.7662,7.3353,0.1502,1.1169,3.4586,0.0225,0.0287,5.3529,6.6022,0.4269,1.7977,3.4922,8.3904,2.9126,0.7073,8.6234,4.1193,1.333,3.7394,3.3936,4.5578,4.2347,1.5612,0.844,1.8321,7.9241,1.5917,1.3378,3.3206,0.7172,0.024,0.008,0.0034,0.0001,2.7617,1.076,5.1395,0.1793,0.7524,0.006,0.0255,1.5954,6.3627,6.0415,2.8169,5.7419,5.8662,5.1493,4.3738,3.7635,3.7377,0.172,2.9676,5.0291,4.2755,2.0831,3.411,1.9737,1.0798,17.868,1.8069,0.933,0.5396,1.0162,0.0151,0.0001,3.5527,2.4255,4.4748,4.6833,0.0235,4.1305,1.3623,6.0595,4.1229,5.341,0.3455,0.6233,5.3221,0.2062,5.2037,4.1126,5.9476,0.0143,1.9381,4.0035,1.0121,1.7978,3.4739,1.4177,5.7751,3.7993,0.4811,1.1474,0.0095,0.0333,3.0583,4.4443,2.2304,5.5183,1.4132,2.7353,0.1037,1.2182,0.5364,1.3373,1.5694,0.0036,0.0001,5.4366,2.3132,3.8345,3.053,6.3929,5.4719,4.065,1.7242,5.9498,3.045,6.8712,5.3692,1.2538,0.0021,0.6185,7.4653,0.0409,0.8305,0.0022,0.0053,2.6405,6.6174,4.3598,2.0892,1.687,2.058,2.1425,3.9961,4.4423,0.6883,2.9573,1.2498,0.4959,0.1811,0.3989,0.0035,0.0001,1.8158,1.1409,6.9142,0.2916,3.687,0.6694,2.608,0.0032,0.0059,1.7666,4.0478,5.1639,5.8136,3.2466,0.2704,3.9068,4.8665,2.3812,3.3982,2.6148,6.6887,2.2359,0.8665,5.9719,1.788,2.4459,4.6244,3.4777,0.6984,0.6896,2.7183,1.5338,0.0044,0.0001,1.6307,2.8139,1.4607,3.6005,0.0696,3.1118,3.1627,0.0132,0.0885,3.6257,3.745,3.2218,1.9114,1.5066,3.835,1.2347,2.5925,2.1325,0.784,0.5547,0.6132,3.5976,1.5369,0.6964,0.0001,5.7718,2.2967,1.9903,7.8518,0.0216,0.5495,0.1681,0.1537,0.3683,0.0033,0.0001,4.1074,0.2803,4.0313,0.0079,0.0088,3.9374,2.0841,3.7989,3.9282,4.9119,2.6842,1.2294,1.5391,4.4527,3.1796,6.2598,1.097,5.6074,5.5496,7.498,7.0918,1.1811,2.0785,1.6351,1.5456,1.6122,0.3527,0.0793,0.0423,0.1146,0.1722,0.0032,0.0001,5.9153,0.1218,5.5557,2.3735,5.5342,2.8963,0.0037,0.0053,2.9724,3.1543,1.7759,1.6555,3.2678,5.8081,1.2823,2.892,1.0224,4.0162,2.0936,1.6523,0.1201,0.0751,1.7182,3.5456,0.1386,1.5685,6.1203,0.3778,2.1672,0.0071,0.0073,1.5087,1.4961,4.4738,0.3247,2.2595,0.0129,0.0001,0.077,2.7382,0.8546,2.5176,0.0027,0.0088,1.7254,6.5801,2.0525,3.0987,6.4338,1.7258,4.1878,0.7572,0.9916,5.2269,0.6988,6.3503,1.9831,4.3007,4.6702,0.2528,1.6386,3.4138,0.767,1.7,0.005,0.0038,0.5685,2.7993,1.2477,3.0141,0.2316,1.342,0.0035,0.0001,1.3915,5.5563,0.1763,2.7678,2.9063,0.0064,0.0034,2.6703,0.8632,6.7061,4.8315,2.8781,0.4014,0.0001,6.0162,0.5612,1.0189,25.9125,8.1136,2.0766,20.1612,3.8248,0.8,18.8743,0.0199,0.0532,1.445,0.0253,5.2924,0.673,0.0004,2.0344,0.7558,0.0005,5.0436,0.367,4.2405,23.0967,0.0165,0.0397,6.0765,4.9057]}
{"id":3553,"ended":false,"length":475,"text":"The Secret Life of a Casul Meth User\n\nThe book The Secret Life of a Casul Meth User (or Meth User, sometimes commonly referred to as the \"Secret Life\" of a Casul Meth User) (1914) is a book by Joseph A. Knecht published in 1934; the book begins with a story on the origin and nature of Casul Meth, and continues with stories and articles examining its scientific and scientific implications, including the development of new and related drugs.\n\nSynopsis\nIn the book, J.E. Knecht takes on the story of a Casul Meth User, and his relationship to Casul Meth, as they enter a different world of research in his lifetime and examine a variety of science. The book also includes biographical details about Knecht's wife Mary Ann and his son John.\n\nIn Knecht's novel, Joseph A. Knecht refers to the beginning of the Casul Meth life cycle as a time warp in which DNA could be transferred and then passed on to the same person. Joseph A. Knecht describes the origins of Casul Meth as \"...something which you just learned was the origin of life...\" in his novel.\nIn his book, Knecht discusses his early interest in science, although this appears to be limited to those topics pertaining to the human body and to the medical treatment of Casul Meth, but also concerns the development of new drugs. Knecht relates the history and story that follows the formation and end-of-life effects of Casul Meth and subsequent discoveries of new and related drug candidates. In his book, Knecht describes the influence of science on Casul Meth and describes many potential drug candidates to which the author is referencing, including all the drugs currently approved for use. Knecht also mentions the development of the Casul Meth drug development process and the potential for new drug candidates to be approved.\n\nFor the first portion of the book, Knecht talks about Casul Meth in the same terms which are used by scientists who may have similar stories during history.

{"id":2628,"ended":true,"length":496,"text":"Write a story about a made up pantheon and their creation of the universe. [ WP ]\n\nThe book is intended to be used as a guide for those interested in learning how to write a good story about a made up pantheon (a pantheon formed out of the same ideas as the \"A\" myth) and the creative properties of the pantheon (i.e. the universe).\nIn addition, it is also suitable for the novice and experienced writer.\nIt is also considered a valuable and useful resource in terms of training, editing, making and learning as well.\n\nI had an experience with this idea but the plot was very complex and very frustrating. Once I read the book I really just realized how bad it was. The story was a bit short but I liked the idea. Only a few pages remained.\n\nI also read the book and was very excited to hear about that but after reading the book it became clear there would have been more. That said, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants something a bit more complex, or who has only wanted to try some panthes but would be confused and frustrated if the story was as long as this book (if you are a beginner, I think you will love this book :)).\n\n[ WP ]\n\nIf you would like to take part in this writing course, please leave me your email and password...\n\nThe course will help students learn about this pantheon, its creation, its history and why it existed and was created.\nThe content consists of a short outline containing the following information:\nHow the pantheon started from the beginning\nAtom of each pantheon\nThe history of each pantheon\nThe evolution of each pantheon\nThe reasons why each pantheon is the same\nUnderstanding all important pantheons (the ancient gods)\nThe history of different pantheons\nThe importance of pantheon mythology and its associated symbols\nWhat should a pantheon be called\nThe pantheon of myths and legends (i.e. the ancient kingdoms of Egypt and ancient kingdoms of Persia\nthe three pantheons)\nThe history of pantheons\nThe stories behind some of the myths and legends\nThe creation of and worship of every pantheon\nThe stories on pantheons\nThe stories on myths and legends about each pantheon\n\nWe are here to support you to write or edit a story after reading this book.\nIf you are a member of our

{"id":85,"ended":true,"length":511,"text":"After a series of misunderstandings and miscommunications you find yourself Pope of the Catholic Church, the Pope, the Pope of the Holy Roman Empire, a member of the bishops, the Pope of the Holy Roman Empire, and a Christian (and probably Protestant-like, if you care).\n\nA good example \u2013 I was invited to a Christmas Service at the National Cathedral in Melbourne, Australia, and for a few minutes, I was surrounded by very enthusiastic parishioners. I was also invited to sing and help out with some of the parishioners\u2019 requests for a small gift basket of wine. One Catholic parishioner asked me to sing the words \u2018Rome is Rome\u2019 to all those he had invited for the service.\n\nThe service at Melbourne was an astonishingly big event. I sang out the words aloud to more than a dozen people, but the song itself was very personal and very personal, both for me and my family.\n\nIn my home I have been known to sing words of the Holy Father\u2019s, or at least his words of the same Holy Week, in order to show him love, and he responded very well to it; I got to enjoy a Christmas special that he has been asking for for more than a year.\n\nDuring my free time, I take trips out to the South African Riviera with my parents and stepnicks who are of Catholic faith. I also use my time for many of the other activities that I have enjoyed: hunting, hiking and fishing both on the South African beaches and in the highlands of the South Africa coast. I also enjoy traveling the world, and spending time with my family.\n\nHaving heard of Pope Leo XIII\u2019s \u2018Rome is Rome\u2019 song, I have heard more of the Pope\u2019s than I like to think. I always tell my parents of \u2018Rome is Rome\u2019 and will recite the verses again just before my children are born. One of the things I do as a parent is do not forget the words. In fact, it is the only time at the moment that I can recall ever having forgotten the words.\n\nI am also reminded that there are many things that I find in Rome worth remembering. One of them is \u2018the Church\u2019s history\u2019, because Rome was a period of history which many people might not have been aware of until much later, when it was a part of our Catholic civilisation.\n\nWith all my best wishes,\nSydney\n\nThe views, opinions and positions expressed in this blog and in various publications are the personal views of the author or author alone.

At the trial, he finds out that the person on trial has been falsely accused for the serial killer's crimes.\n\nThe defendant, 30-year-old Paul McIlhenney who also faces murder, stabbed 37-year-old Richard McCallie, of White-Sidewood Hill, and killed his father, Richard McCallie, of the same address on April 3.\n\nHis trial will be heard through public prosecutor Paul McIlhenney and is expected to last into early June, when the verdicts of jurors are announced.

McCallie and his accomplice, 26-year-old Richard McCallie, also fired off two rounds of ammunition to McCallie before being fatally shot.\n\nMcCallie\u2019s body was found inside the car.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking, it\u2019s a horrible way to go, but the best thing to do is get out of here,\u201d said McIlhenney.\n\nMcIlhenney also told an interviewer during testimony last month what he wanted to say.\n\n\u201cI want him to know, \u2018You know what I just said?\u2019 I hope he got the benefit of the doubt and the evidence and, because of his actions, got the opportunity to talk about it and he should have done much better,\u201d he said.\n\nMcCallie\u2019s parents are scheduled for a court appearance next month.\n\nA posthumously awarded peace award to McIlhenney continues to be paid for by the US Justice Department.","token_len":560,"entropy":[10.7104,1.5702,2.6401,6.6503,4.9415,8.2701,0.6135,1.7486,5.8224,1.2456,2.7237,0.5709,2.6475,8.7693,2.8773,0.8725,1.9556,4.9477,4.7188,2.0652,2.8008,1.4136,6.0367,0.343,5.3338,2.9532,7.4444,0.7952,0.7038,1.8506,0.5164,2.0466,0.0017,1.9543,3.6756,2.3995,7.2274,0.6603,0.0051,0.0878,0.0008,5.2013,5.6555,5.5262,3.0374,0.6344,6.3017,4.3638,3.35,2.0485,1.7983,7.8289,6.3589,0.1308,0.0011,0.005,0.0006,5.0926,6.425,2.9478,6.1551,2.2736,3.8047,6.0474,7.2484,5.5692,5.8672,1.7068,3.7716,8.5357,0.493,3.1523,2.3401,1.495,4.2161,1.0309,4.7904,2.8275,0.0327,0.0203,0.6713,1.6952,4.1814,2.5061,2.4334,2.5421,2.9286,3.4016,1.7073,0.746,0.0003,4.6604,3.0908,3.3569,1.3585,3.1394,6.5422,6.9118,5.1493,4.5458,4.5356,1.2673,0.0054,0.0048,2.8511,4.9606,1.3365,0.0386,1.5739,5.5402,2.7044,2.1874,3.1359,2.1454,1.4336,3.6694,2.0663,3.6439,5.1069,1.6466,2.0884,0.1202,7.3934,2.4966,1.8435,0.0016,0.0012,0.0027,1.3571,2.0573,6.8679,1.6868,1.4189,0.0102,0.4779,0.0523,2.7847,3.003,1.9742,0.0686,1.6196,3.5176,5.0192,2.7577,0.1324,0.3007,0.0003,1.4829,0.0092,0.0014,0.0034,1.9771,2.3732,0.0622,3.9743,1.7262,0.0116,0.0009,4.0218,0.0442,1.1517,3.8899,0.0017,2.4769,5.4221,4.531,7.1927,7.694,0.7689,4.0694,7.6119,4.705,4.5905,0.3918,3.5472,4.7662,1.0806,4.42,4.2841,4.9226,1.7075,5.5926,3.6133,0.6121,1.8309,5.1295,4.7397,0.7606,2.7998,1.8163,3.7147,0.0106,0.0007,2.6747,5.5177,2.4516,1.1445,2.2516,1.0132,3.8315,0.6248,3.8132,0.3549,0.024,1.6761,0.6748,0.4518,0.0002,1.2016,7.2688,0.1148,3.4465,4.5897,3.756,1.2787,2.6186,0.6705,5.3227,1.3818,0.0164,0.6545,0.3735,0.0002,4.7191,1.6157,0.6951,0.2388,0.6377,0.0615,0.0009,0.0012,4.7758,3.568,0.0221,1.4808,0.0087,0.0009,4.037,5.9056,3.0202,0.0518,0.0063,13.9499,9.6995,2.6655,5.5462,1.1818,4.3254,3.5348,9.2598,7.5933,2.8594,2.4587,2.8771,0.8629,5.2018,9.228,3.6267,5.7864,1.3903,2.4974,3.9666,7.1938,4.6103,2.4016,3.0819,2.6154,0.9498,5.064,1.2039,4.5384,3.3561,0.5133,3.0547,3.3189,1.0157,3.0103,1.4404,3.4734,0.9404,0.0104,2.7047,0.5887,3.239,1.5343,4.9397,2.3904,5.4954,0.0136,0.0015,2.1796,3.2033,5.563,1.1767,5.1549,1.855,0.0048,0.0015,1.8356,2.9522,1.4365,4.1167,1.1972,1.7545,5.2379,0.0133,0.0076,6.4415,6.557,2.0527,2.6097,1.6547,2.0571,0.2083,2.1252,0.5564,1.0909,0.5581,3.8039,1.6306,3.3058,0.2408,0.25,0.0002,3.7766,5.8885,1.0043,0.1329,0.8334,0.0453,0.0012,0.0014,4.1524,1.4313,5.9022,0.2793,0.3375,2.7599,7.6836,0.6417,0.007,0.0013,1.9675,0.0263,0.0109,1.2405,1.5202,4.5484,0.0092,0.001,3.5847,1.7694,3.8456,0.1592,1.0746,4.7704,0.0171,0.0013,0.0103,0.0008,3.9165,0.9409,0.0112,0.0041,0.2763,3.1387,4.3906,6.3573,3.4815,2.335,2.718,1.9368,4.549,3.0551,0.0173,0.0011,3.9002,3.7179,3.8797,0.1731,0.7594,0.3769,0.0002,1.1238,0.3111,0.003,1.9809,0.0277,0.1552,2.2236,0.1199,0.397,4.3704,1.2211,2.138,2.8262,1.3205,0.0002,4.2526,1.9189,4.9429,2.2063,1.5454,0.17,6.8014,2.9528,3.9937,0.6788,0.1441,0.0268,3.3939,2.9543,5.0044,0.3906,2.9602,1.861,2.0134,3.4007,4.2951,1.4408,2.7616,0.335,0.3049,2.8986,0.9183,0.5244,0.8863,1.4801,1.6918,1.085,4.0955,1.5742,0.0653,0.0007,0.0014,0.6776,0.5354,0.0002,2.1671,1.9218,0.0015,0.0015,3.2747,2.5023,4.8345,3.7579,3.7312,5.3368,4.0551,1.5607,6.4493,0.8768,4.3301,0.4655,1.1002,2.648,0.4784,0.0001,1.3801,0.5429,1.2173,0.7808,5.1207,0.4857,3.0844,2.1708,2.8768,8.0507,4.827,2.1304,1.682,2.4637,5.2133,0.6769,1.1139,0.6916,3.79,4.8227,4.9446,0.9559,5.48,2.6909,5.296,0.0376,0.7022,0.0185,2.5969,2.9038,5.9257,2.1962,4.7208,4.8884,1.2674,3.362,3.5388,0.3009,3.9546,1.6039,4.1392,0.1045,4.0208,1.0254,2.0106,2.5381,2.8398,3.9111,1.5912,2.7881,7.5461,0.6766,2.1524,0.3488,1.1069,2.4378,0.3455,0.1072,0.196,0.0002,1.7928,1.2521,0.0051,0.5424,0.0103,0.2184,3.8435,3.2512,3.4522,2.1579,0.9798,2.4886,0.6924,3.3802,0.9897,0.445,0.7528,0.0002,4.1837,4.6111,6.223,2.4696,0.9971,8.2695,2.55,0.9456,1.6551,0.083,0.0014,0.0028,6.6942,0.7685,0.8446,3.839,2.4934,1.611,0.8034,6.8275,3.3543,0.0274,0.5988]}
{"id":2095,"ended":true,"length":554,"text":"Every time you fall asleep you immediately wake up in the middle of a historic battle as a random person, if your character dies you always wake up back in your bed, that's my experience, it's why I never dream a dream I just wake up, I didn't see it, didn't have a dream, just kept dreaming it, so i guess that's what your saying?\nYou can be an \"evil doctor\" if you're not a doctor. You can't be depressed if you're not a depressed doctor.\nBut my argument is different to your opinion because by that logic every person who is not depressed makes a better doctor than everyone who is not depressed.\nYou're being downvoted because your statement supports your argument because everything else you said is true. If your opinion wasn't so wrong you would have said \"Every time you fall asleep you immediately wake up a random person\" which is probably correct but you don't believe it. If your opinion is that every person in existence has an advantage that they would have been more than likely to be successful doctors you wouldn't have said \"every time you fall asleep you immediately wake up in the middle of a historic battle\".\nI don't understand your logic, how do you explain that to someone who doesn't believe that every person, anywhere in history, has an advantage that they would have been less likely to be successful because it would take more time to fall asleep?\nYou know I said this when I said \"every person in existence has an advantage\". If every person in existence had an advantage that they could've won by the time they fell asleep that means every person who fell asleep would be successful because it would take more time to fall asleep. So the difference between \"every person in existence has an advantage\" and \"every day you fall asleep this isn't so sure it happens\", basically the same thing is true.\nI see what you're saying. However, you're correct that you don't believe EVERY time you see the mirror, it's still up to you to determine if the result is related to any other factors. Your conclusion is wrong.  You don't believe everything. In fact you think *every person* in existence has an advantage to what's happened. You don't think \"every day you fall asleep\" would be the most likely outcome for an actor who had an unusually high IQ to work as a doctor at the level they see a doctor in.\nThat makes it a different opinion. Since no one believes every movie actor that can work as a doctor it's incorrect for you to use the argument that every movie actor is likely not to be successful because they have no advantage which the answer to your question is that movie actors don't have any advantage to the end result.","token_len":561,"entropy":[5.307,1.5318,6.465,1.4286,2.3082,6.3187,2.2322,0.0495,2.5669,0.953,1.0391,0.0063,1.8653,10.7103,3.3702,5.4459,2.4366,7.2438,3.8339,2.8136,5.84,4.1014,3.2791,3.1299,2.6669,5.5867,2.5021,0.02,5.3257,0.7176,2.4975,3.7962,1.9064,4.612,0.6897,6.311,4.1302,2.4736,3.1643,0.3406,5.3097,0.4998,4.7369,4.8923,5.566,1.728,4.4836,4.7358,3.3416,0.0325,3.1586,1.9232,4.4895,0.0005,4.471,2.064,2.5789,5.0439,0.0002,3.9043,1.6862,0.9168,1.4977,3.3789,5.6757,1.7086,3.5882,1.9337,3.8897,5.7861,3.8025,2.2667,0.4089,1.9644,5.3163,6.3703,3.578,1.3535,8.3174,2.3717,4.6003,3.7782,5.7678,4.5035,6.6811,0.4382,2.741,0.1224,2.5699,2.7078,2.5431,1.591,1.2494,1.98,0.7514,2.874,0.8313,8.067,1.5631,0.1714,0.339,0.4694,1.008,2.0247,2.5345,0.4884,2.0581,3.7484,5.3246,6.4056,0.7309,5.365,4.3018,2.0404,5.8937,2.7894,6.8619,3.4888,2.46,5.2416,2.4452,1.5894,1.914,2.7984,2.1386,6.1934,1.1646,4.612,0.5892,1.4051,2.5262,1.5755,0.2438,1.0477,0.3154,0.4884,1.1295,2.367,2.5052,5.0365,8.3371,3.5754,0.0013,1.449,2.7283,6.6367,7.3932,1.4102,2.6797,3.2786,6.7814,2.3273,1.8429,1.3134,1.2054,2.044,0.5471,3.8208,2.472,4.1998,5.4214,0.0003,3.783,4.1045,1.8264,1.2183,1.2004,2.3165,2.5306,7.3161,1.4157,0.4377,0.0871,0.0006,0.1125,0.3832,0.0566,0.0004,7.3938,0.2454,0.0384,2.1704,3.6189,0.8175,4.8394,4.158,2.2812,2.1998,2.5583,0.0006,3.3529,2.0189,1.0796,2.9533,1.0848,0.2782,1.8066,3.7194,2.8243,0.9902,3.5616,3.8113,1.9964,2.9028,4.6784,3.1776,2.2677,4.3188,2.2791,2.9255,2.9038,4.4195,3.4653,0.8618,2.0402,4.4871,5.1118,3.4392,3.3593,0.0008,1.4601,0.2897,0.7183,1.9503,0.4311,0.1372,0.0622,0.0036,0.3106,0.2553,0.0546,0.0005,5.5172,0.1532,0.0039,0.0006,0.0059,0.0252,0.0095,4.1402,0.8666,2.4991,2.3736,0.0005,3.5865,2.0813,3.0595,1.9477,4.5246,2.0252,0.2211,2.482,1.1759,1.8766,1.9257,0.542,2.3124,0.0005,1.8133,2.2406,1.2485,0.5916,5.6191,5.7477,1.2162,4.2764,1.5455,0.6662,0.3356,0.016,0.6988,0.1144,0.2736,0.622,0.3272,2.9738,0.6513,0.0643,0.5523,0.0932,6.0246,3.6395,2.7446,5.0755,2.9502,1.3017,0.9202,3.6927,0.0468,2.1676,0.6676,2.1245,3.8349,3.0673,3.8999,3.3138,4.3903,0.4535,1.4431,2.0259,1.3394,1.3683,0.5889,0.067,0.2176,0.0253,0.0072,3.3339,3.0736,2.6983,0.1707,0.9023,0.0365,0.9328,0.3033,0.0069,1.1418,0.2629,3.4628,5.0867,4.3588,5.092,3.9004,0.2848,0.5269,1.365,0.008,3.5732,4.8235,1.3923,0.2642,3.8727,3.2421,0.0061,1.6969,2.5585,2.4407,2.1765,2.5534,0.9187,0.1789,0.4278,0.0664,0.237,0.1496,0.0178,0.6221,3.4735,3.4108,4.7308,0.8259,3.1634,0.1908,0.2947,0.387,0.0135,0.2707,0.0097,0.0014,0.1217,0.1062,0.1328,0.0491,5.9795,1.8537,0.3221,0.0096,5.9433,5.7363,0.0005,2.8318,5.6242,3.7333,4.8981,3.3553,7.321,3.223,1.7976,0.5552,3.2663,2.4511,1.0215,0.6519,2.243,4.3561,3.5869,0.1449,0.3973,0.285,1.5105,5.8563,0.9579,2.2914,1.3894,5.9587,1.2052,2.8764,2.0829,0.0006,0.9717,6.4634,6.4526,0.6749,9.3811,3.2514,5.4242,1.9057,3.1911,0.8931,5.7196,6.7933,0.9015,0.6777,1.0066,2.8518,1.1999,2.4485,6.9068,0.5847,7.9215,0.0697,4.3153,2.3741,2.5006,1.166,4.4113,4.8176,0.6504,4.7674,1.6613,7.3794,9.077,2.4434,0.0005,0.6401,3.7709,2.0929,4.9816,0.2291,1.6572,2.44,8.3887,1.3836,4.4336,0.3153,2.0643,0.0634,0.3714,0.1465,0.0086,4.4116,5.7705,3.9525,4.2677,1.5937,2.3838,2.0344,0.0003,1.8476,3.5169,0.2305,1.2907,0.3776,0.0593,0.0097,3.7471,4.3678,1.1627,2.1054,3.2682,1.3071,0.5539,2.2762,4.0177,6.4751,2.2472,4.2859,1.8101,7.9909,1.758,3.4447,2.4087,5.8087,2.541,0.3332,0.6172,5.1192,1.1182,6.7108,2.733,6.7881,4.3267,0.9023,1.5844,0.7615,1.3221,3.4974,4.5931,2.5957,3.2917,3.7134,4.7612,1.1777,6.4888,4.5922,0.4172,3.1221,2.657,7.2612,5.0057,4.4655,4.8798,3.4874,0.5292,0.1292,0.1036,7.4004,1.0273,7.1412,2.4233,0.8294,0.0535,5.3946,1.7525,4.1393,0.7046,0.7372,1.8897,0.3403,1.6575,5.3367,5.587,2.397,0.9521,0.3881,1.5494,2.0848,2.4449,3.3193,1.5909,6.1943,5.3219,6.5304,1.4743,1.2581,0.5079,0.539,2.0784,6.3386,0.5109,3.5683,0.0004,0.7005,2.2837,0.2588,2.6646,3.0514,4.9761,0.9792,0.842]}
{"id":2626,"ended":false,"length":513,"text":"Quentin Tarantino is given complete creative control to retell a classic Disney story.\nShoot, Quentin Tarantino is given complete creative control to retell a classic Disney story.\nBy\nCatherine Lister\nJuly 23, 1997\nBy The Associated Press\n\nQuentin Tarantino (1918-2005)\n\nThe director had never told a story \u2014 the studio has never produced a feature-length, feature-length film this way.\n\nIt was a question of time and how much screen time he had left for Disney's \"Beauties\" movie, which will be released by the studio on July 23.\n\nThe director has not only given full control as to the film to its cast, but he is also giving out a license to rewrite the script.\n\nIn a scene from the film \"Beauties,\" which has been in development for the past half-century, Steve Carell, Matt Damon, Christopher Plummer and James Bond star. The director has his name cut out on the script in a manner where the script has had time to adapt to the screen and to be adapted to print and on film.\n\nIf Tarantino writes down exactly what the script is going to be rewritten for, what type of film it will appear in and what it will look like before it is released, the director can rewrite the script in five minutes. If the script is too long, the director can rewrite it in just five minutes.\n\nThe studio typically releases its films to studios in advance to speed them through the process, then a producer or screenwriter or director may decide to copy the script and change the way it is written. A major exception is the director who chooses not to allow the first scene to be edited so that it appears faster on the screen.\n\nAn exception is often the director's choice. When the script is already going through the editing of the story, his choices are too lengthy to be included in a movie.\n\n\"We know when to do things creatively so we don't waste time,\" said Quentin. \"It is something we like doing.\" He added, \"I think it's what's best for the movies.\"\n\n\"I think it's really great and I'm very proud of it.\"\n\nThe director said he has not written or edited at all. He told a story in which a black family's journey to an African American university leads them both to college and to a new world.\n\n\"It's so true,\" he said. \"If you have a story for a few months you're making progress \u2014 the first act of it is telling it. You're making progress, you're making progress.\"\n\nHe added, \"It's a really good piece of art.\"","token_len":561,"entropy":[11.3119,2.5032,0.0002,2.9213,7.6681,8.0113,4.9808,0.1194,3.3282,5.3297,2.1421,2.7477,2.9602,7.0022,2.7706,2.0454,1.7014,18.1946,2.6515,3.2552,8.4707,1.9564,0.0003,2.6398,1.0517,0.2311,0.0724,0.0002,0.0119,0.0038,0.0008,0.0122,0.0049,0.0011,0.0031,0.0357,1.1097,6.1998,7.2064,5.6261,3.1319,4.5639,4.9254,2.8515,7.0299,3.2292,0.1113,4.6415,0.8009,4.0041,4.215,3.4528,0.0014,0.6557,0.5473,6.6174,0.0001,0.0015,0.0005,4.3897,4.1093,4.9989,0.4216,3.0458,0.3567,3.5,1.068,2.5664,3.2573,5.165,4.4376,5.3942,1.646,1.1191,7.2982,4.5544,7.3718,3.4811,2.3455,4.665,0.9552,2.5142,2.7932,0.0041,4.6099,2.0051,0.2969,0.1619,1.324,6.8196,3.5188,1.1968,1.4707,0.3986,3.4907,1.7535,2.1127,4.9693,1.0014,2.672,2.7984,3.8971,1.9364,5.0351,0.0358,1.6421,1.7129,2.1671,3.3427,6.7968,1.4957,3.1364,4.5138,10.5104,2.0463,4.0519,1.5163,1.2744,4.0962,1.0632,0.5402,4.9587,2.7896,2.0201,1.4542,2.0092,2.4698,0.6614,0.6968,0.0003,1.9827,2.718,2.7115,3.9463,4.3899,2.7431,4.0843,1.946,7.3043,0.6544,1.7205,4.0614,3.6533,3.7287,3.4188,1.2039,0.6799,1.5774,2.4764,0.5051,1.8034,6.107,2.3779,6.4587,0.4978,5.0315,1.2051,1.8769,1.8311,0.645,0.0002,2.8816,1.4143,6.2607,1.5103,0.694,1.5595,2.8699,1.6707,0.6536,0.3054,2.3792,3.4257,1.0176,3.0403,1.6241,0.4324,4.2494,0.7445,5.1881,0.4835,1.0779,0.1729,7.7125,1.6713,0.0004,2.1476,9.0613,0.4061,1.0372,5.5647,2.8203,0.0204,0.539,4.3711,6.6106,0.9469,2.6985,2.5616,2.5784,1.7684,6.6236,4.3617,5.7075,1.499,3.1014,0.5097,1.445,4.2239,1.9519,4.3862,6.3278,1.7803,3.0854,3.3254,5.9517,4.9031,0.1634,3.3093,1.6343,1.1589,2.5995,2.2899,3.261,3.3803,3.4312,1.9986,6.5746,2.146,3.7065,1.5804,0.2975,0.2586,0.0002,5.2358,3.884,0.0009,6.2585,4.0271,5.5717,0.6654,1.9715,1.4318,2.4781,2.6817,0.057,1.028,7.1454,2.6864,0.5748,3.8113,5.9397,0.0186,4.3122,2.5135,0.6822,7.2259,0.6606,2.9602,0.919,2.3461,0.4136,2.1732,0.0107,5.4679,1.2134,0.8008,1.6886,0.5143,2.1119,2.8678,2.0814,3.5287,1.2269,0.8845,1.9974,4.6665,1.5532,1.1316,3.8667,1.3975,1.2154,0.7729,3.7396,0.706,0.5166,1.1919,0.848,0.2747,1.0108,0.5672,0.5217,4.3409,2.1869,0.5653,0.2943,0.338,0.0002,1.811,3.8148,7.552,3.9026,2.3991,2.3703,4.0345,5.6241,1.955,2.4195,3.9543,7.1369,5.086,4.1051,1.4559,2.0357,2.0752,5.1187,5.7047,4.1424,2.2368,3.6703,0.0875,4.332,1.7083,3.9161,2.7921,0.4382,6.6041,0.8422,0.6748,1.1934,4.8017,1.2826,4.8498,0.7166,0.6081,1.0755,0.8276,5.0544,5.1012,4.084,0.6815,1.727,5.3463,2.8368,4.4101,1.7731,0.0051,5.3185,1.2271,5.0814,5.0422,1.0775,0.5927,2.7167,4.1957,0.8192,1.1301,3.4616,7.87,3.146,1.2885,0.461,0.5514,0.2816,0.0002,5.6178,2.4777,0.7946,6.0631,2.317,1.468,2.5943,1.4345,3.8651,3.8584,1.4306,1.6191,0.6877,4.4917,5.9206,1.3807,1.3026,0.7554,3.8747,1.1226,4.4535,0.7028,5.3692,4.2966,1.4153,7.0789,5.7195,1.474,1.3714,4.4518,0.4231,2.0663,3.0221,1.0619,0.807,0.0002,2.8327,3.1919,4.5452,4.3177,3.5747,3.5261,3.9234,6.958,4.3158,0.8713,2.4153,0.0006,4.4481,1.1886,2.3761,0.9773,5.0019,3.9679,0.3799,2.4395,2.9274,3.9347,1.063,4.9375,2.6373,2.843,5.1225,1.5684,1.3613,0.1055,2.1026,1.8009,1.552,1.3573,5.2194,3.0817,2.4092,0.295,0.8537,5.318,1.287,0.0933,0.0002,3.5812,2.7684,1.3601,1.265,0.32,4.2813,3.2016,4.159,1.4047,2.045,2.1095,1.4692,0.2553,1.032,2.3515,0.2795,0.0002,1.985,1.882,2.7158,0.8647,2.3058,3.0338,4.3448,4.1137,2.6096,6.4701,0.7089,2.7663,1.3472,4.4211,3.8885,1.7288,2.4586,1.1223,1.8317,5.5443,5.592,4.4398,5.6735,1.1831,4.5557,2.3153,1.67,6.0517,4.4538,0.6227,6.5678,0.3599,5.5547,1.465,1.3241,1.7136,3.8925,2.7853,0.5275,0.7251,0.0002,0.9206,1.9038,0.5894,4.0553,5.0809,1.2937,0.5411,0.0761,0.2682,0.1383,4.0291,0.7903,2.9543,1.1,1.8922,5.1988,1.5785,6.8923,2.6068,2.5115,2.0952,5.6473,3.8564,4.4169,3.8436,3.818,5.9378,1.9889,2.0425,0.8106,5.7504,2.0986,1.6565,2.7058,1.1707,1.5071,0.5159,1.835,2.0836,0.3064,1.0107,0.5374,2.343,0.0682,0.0002,2.5666,1.9146,0.6827,0.0387,1.9158,0.3475,2.1075,3.6831,2.0961,4.9626,0.1972,3.2564,1.4252]}
{"id":4234,"ended":false,"length":480,"text":"A 13 year-old boy starts Trashportation, a trash business for his apartment complex.\n\nThe town of Lapeer, Nebraska, has a long history of trashportation, including a large warehouse, a warehouse used by small businesses, and trash-picking, the largest form of trashportation. But now a 14-year-old boy named Andrew is beginning a venture \u2014 the rickety little truck, one of several trucks that the town holds held in its memory.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy\u2026 it\u2019s just like how we\u2019re allowed to keep up with the needs of local businesses that have had to turn it into a place where everything goes to waste, not to mention the trash,\u201d Andrew said of the rickety truck. \u201cI\u2019m going to start using that trash as a sort of trash pallets that I\u2019m going to use as a little dump.\u201d\n\nAndrew, who turns 16 on Sunday, hopes that by teaching his friends about trashportation and picking it up for his home, he will be able to give his neighborhood and the surrounding area a run for their money.\n\nLike the Lapeer, the town has a reputation as a hard-to-find place\u2014it\u2019s home to a dumpster fire almost all year round. Last year, the sheriff\u2019s office found 745 abandoned trash bags, and the town also has a reputation for being very clean. But according to the town\u2019s waste-management director, a trash bin was found in the town\u2019s recycling yard, and the trash picked up and shipped was stored.\n\n\u201cA lot of trash that was being picked off of doesn\u2019t land on the landfill, it\u2019s there for the landfill to take. And the whole thing is going to go away once the town can see the waste,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the town might start offering free litter-management services once it gets its trash bags out in the open.\n\n\u201cI love being a little bit of history,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat can we do so it\u2019s like \u2018You know what, just do it.\u2019 And I\u2019m just always excited to start, and I know that by a year long, you\u2019ll find out tons of important information about that trash that you might not know about.\u201d\n\nAndrew is one of several Lapeer residents who may or may not have forgotten about the trash transportation business they started.

Also, at the moment it is not what I wanted to say, so any thoughts would be really appreciated.               *EDIT:*                *I'm an avid reader and am going to try reading a lot of it in a few months *AND I'M NOT A GREAT GUY OR A GREAT LOVERS GUY*            *If something ever happens to me, let me know!*        *Thanks for all the advice people!*","token_len":570,"entropy":[9.9645,0.0801,4.0974,1.5504,3.4034,1.5587,6.2201,0.1679,3.4183,1.8294,1.3866,2.4396,2.9898,6.3023,2.9603,0.0718,1.7404,1.9573,1.7674,2.7845,11.615,1.1091,5.9059,0.8666,8.1379,5.6692,1.3073,1.1515,1.0291,0.7894,0.6482,0.5728,0.5149,0.4463,0.3846,0.3343,0.3007,0.2749,0.2597,0.249,0.2415,0.2381,0.2355,0.2339,0.2339,0.2348,0.2352,0.2351,0.2372,0.2373,0.2385,0.239,0.2385,0.2408,0.2406,0.242,0.24,0.2396,0.2363,0.2345,0.2351,0.2307,0.2268,0.2233,0.2192,6.3445,3.1806,3.1577,4.6441,2.2687,6.2807,0.361,4.3278,1.6815,0.7372,0.1698,0.1055,0.0989,0.1054,0.0986,0.0909,0.0857,0.0698,0.0491,0.0351,0.0271,0.0224,0.0197,0.0179,0.0169,0.0164,0.0166,0.0173,0.0185,0.0202,0.0227,0.0257,0.0293,0.033,0.036,0.0377,0.0381,0.0378,0.0377,0.0392,0.0451,0.0548,0.0654,10.3721,2.1412,2.4864,3.4184,6.2878,4.1932,4.474,3.1787,3.5446,1.2124,0.5204,0.073,0.0398,0.0221,0.0211,0.0196,0.0174,0.0158,0.0142,0.0129,0.012,0.0115,0.0113,0.0115,0.012,0.0127,0.0137,0.0143,0.0141,0.0137,0.0122,0.012,0.0149,0.0246,0.0296,0.0301,0.0326,0.0385,0.0457,11.6716,0.0986,3.9369,6.3169,1.5124,0.5298,1.7144,6.5041,0.0598,4.2066,0.525,4.5155,1.8741,2.2864,0.973,1.3826,1.8093,0.7702,0.3588,0.9344,3.456,2.8355,0.9197,1.4786,2.1906,1.7622,2.6429,0.9334,3.6229,0.2839,2.7092,3.5016,1.8802,0.1641,5.3145,0.6469,2.0321,4.861,1.1936,6.7476,3.7317,0.1122,2.0246,0.2175,1.8281,1.0817,0.1921,0.0251,0.0198,0.0149,0.0121,0.0132,0.0158,0.0179,0.0186,0.0185,10.6747,8.4577,4.0153,4.7757,2.6306,1.6974,1.9058,2.5433,2.7813,3.3465,1.0384,2.0483,1.7022,5.2274,6.4417,2.1117,4.1734,0.0592,0.0174,1.6125,1.0245,5.6246,6.4121,2.3279,3.8969,1.8096,3.9813,4.8727,4.1645,4.2914,4.0255,4.6177,1.8393,4.5214,2.1953,1.6495,5.9637,4.0923,3.856,8.5347,0.0004,4.6434,3.4152,2.594,0.1337,1.7046,2.0226,4.1695,2.1423,0.1834,1.4191,3.6803,5.3075,15.8014,7.0493,4.4292,4.266,5.75,2.0054,1.3976,2.4308,0.2167,7.668,1.7154,5.5391,1.1596,0.1933,5.1734,4.4331,5.2283,4.3054,4.7827,0.3954,0.2214,1.5019,1.2703,3.6546,0.6581,5.0396,0.0171,1.8292,2.0237,0.9012,0.8311,0.516,1.2112,0.5783,0.3536,0.267,0.1728,0.1108,0.0879,0.0911,0.1017,0.1047,0.1006,0.0948,0.0882,0.0825,0.0793,0.0784,0.0794,0.0818,0.0853,0.0904,0.097,0.1041,0.1122,0.1204,0.1294,0.1385,0.1463,0.1558,0.1625,0.1692,0.1776,0.1836,0.1869,0.1913,0.1942,0.1967,0.1963,0.1958,0.1965,0.1932,0.1924,0.1879,7.4272,0.025,5.0218,0.0003,5.2954,4.6511,1.4036,0.9437,0.4889,4.6694,3.6182,5.9591,0.0316,3.4419,4.2339,3.6977,7.4034,1.2934,2.6624,3.5632,3.4111,5.6744,0.1505,4.7353,0.3184,1.9413,2.3993,0.8869,5.8145,2.1785,0.9907,4.1934,5.6975,5.0185,4.6262,5.7352,2.4109,1.8347,0.2833,0.4487,1.1026,0.4007,0.097,0.015,0.0163,0.0141,0.0131,0.0125,0.0122,0.0119,7.7601,2.574,3.4228,0.8825,1.0089,3.4064,5.7245,0.4903,3.7144,3.0081,0.4012,1.6905,3.3584,0.5249,1.2285,0.4385,4.3806,5.499,1.6759,2.6116,2.8698,1.6636,1.2454,6.5303,7.0255,1.0175,2.0235,0.3394,1.691,3.9215,0.9395,4.5379,2.0169,1.0484,5.0546,4.4644,0.0874,2.7878,4.7982,5.4253,0.9402,0.144,0.0661,0.1028,0.0161,0.006,0.005,0.0056,0.0066,0.0078,0.0099,0.0118,0.0104,0.0082,0.0073,14.6191,0.5476,5.8124,1.1154,2.3942,3.4818,3.1634,3.214,5.2243,0.3657,2.9963,1.0609,2.0165,1.1713,2.746,6.6483,2.9698,4.766,0.1935,4.9013,1.4672,0.6159,0.2372,0.0706,0.0527,0.0091,0.0054,0.0062,0.0071,0.0077,0.0088,0.0113,0.0097,0.0158,0.0129,0.0153,6.8379,6.4742,1.4089,4.2851,2.1953,0.4867,0.1995,0.0619,0.0539,0.0184,0.016,0.0167,0.0195,0.0671,0.0408,0.0659,0.0927,0.1103,0.1183,3.1186,3.1806,2.0083,5.4303,3.9981,2.3298,1.4917,3.9081,4.137,0.1932,2.7386,5.8615,2.7283,0.3927,0.9957,3.9865,3.1794,2.2222,1.2803,2.0775,5.8106,7.2894,3.4432,2.3291,0.4073,2.0664,2.5511,5.9456,5.2905,0.2509,4.0756,2.1253,4.1795,3.9201,1.6422,4.0498,5.7129,0.2946,2.7867,1.9477,0.2147,0.2017,0.038,0.0151,0.0106,0.0097,0.0094,0.0098,0.0115,0.016,4.4245,4.8713,6.8469,5.1258,1.6156,0.4853,1.3207,0.9797,4.8267,0.0887,0.0148,2.8949,2.7566,1.6975,0.1834,0.0362,0.0103,0.0065,0.0063,0.0071,5.3976,4.6062,0.7834,2.9979,1.2486,5.4304,6.0742,2.7099,0.8583]}

{"id":695,"ended":false,"length":546,"text":"Last night the monsters returned, and I was shocked to see that I had never seen them so close to home, so I jumped off the bed, and they made a show off of me, including having me give out their names. It was quite a bit of fun!\n\nOne of the things I love about the book is that the stories are so unique, and the characters are so relatable. They have different backgrounds, but because they are relatable, there is one thing that stands out: they are always about the underdog!\n\nIn this case, the monsters have had to defeat three and were a lot longer than usual to get to this point. They were all very brave, and were determined to find their way back to the land where they belong.\n\nI also thought that I was really glad to see the monsters that I was in love with. It really made me feel all more happy to see everyone I had ever known come out onto the red earth and become my own, or at least that\u2019s what I thought it would be like.\n\nAs you can see, there is a lot of emotion thrown in this one, but it is worth remembering that I am also excited to see their transformation into my own. Because I wanted to do this story so badly that I could have my own version of it and they would still get it, and this could be really sweet of me. But oh well, who am I to judge?\n\nAnyway, I was really sad after seeing the monsters turn from their normal selves into creatures that I could now actually believe in and have fun with.\n\nI also really wanted to see the first few chapters made into a book! My heart just goes out to all the friends who came on the red earth to learn and help, but there is a lot to learn from this book, and it was amazing to watch them come together again.\n\nFinally, I wanted to do a bit of storytelling about the book\u2019s main character, who is now out trying to get to a little less than he is to get back through his own bad days. I would even like to learn more about what makes up him. I just wanted to explore what it means to be a person like him at this level, and I know that going to the Red Earth doesn\u2019t always have to be about getting rich or becoming a famous actress.\n\nThese are some of my favorite characters in my latest book, The Book of My Life! And here are a few more pages about the book:\n\nIf you enjoyed this story, then let me know what else you thought of the book. I would love to see what you would like to see in the next book!

{"id":3464,"ended":true,"length":541,"text":"Skeleton Keys, keys that can open any door, exist. Unfortunately, your skeleton is one such key and many organizations seek to exploit you.\n\nThe most commonly mis-named of all of our secret codes is the \"Slider Keys\", which we have found in a few different places around the world including, China, Canada, and the U.S.\n\nThere are hundreds of those keys available out there and if you see them on a public web site, you can be assured that this is a very specific and unique code, if only by understanding it and trying to look it up. You can only put it on your website so that if you get caught, you will probably have to search for it because the codes in question have been published as well as have been publicly available for years.\n\nSkeleton Keys\n\nIf you really want a good look at the \"Sliders\" which use keys in many different positions, the secret keys available in most areas of web use are really simple and straightforward to use. They all consist of an HTML tag that can be passed in any manner you like, or any other form of use, that will work for you.\n\nMost keys can open any door without ever knowing how exactly one of them is open, allowing you to open many many doorways. If you have an older PC that you would like to use for your online activities, or you just want to hide the keys when you are away from your computer, it is not bad to have them open.\n\nOther keys can also be opened online by using the \"Unlock-Key\" function of the web browser. With the ability to simply copy the keys to your computer, you can quickly open any door you want without ever remembering where you had it and without leaving any keys behind so that when you open the door you are safe. If you ever had trouble getting keys to register and unlock, you will always be safe with these keys on your computer and it is this ability which allows us to easily access most parts of the world.\n\nAs you can see, even if you do not know what \"Sliders\" are, you can still find them around the web. There are several free versions available for download from various websites so it would be wise to pick up as many as you possibly can from these sites as they will be the most popular available at the moment.\n\nOther than those listed above, there are many other options available on the web for any number of uses.

{"id":1957,"ended":true,"length":546,"text":"An adult who had died trying to survive against all odds and a kid who commits suicide meet in the afterlife... maybe, maybe, maybe... maybe.. maybe... maybe... maybe... maybe.... maybe... maybe... maybe... maybe... maybe.... maybe... maybe...\n\nThe story of a man who killed himself and his two children and set up a mental hospital and kept up a fight and saved his children was heartbreaking. That's because the only way to move on is through suffering.\n\nIn this series, the father of the two kids has found his place in history as he attempts to bring them back together for the first time since the death of her son... with their father. \"He'll go down,\" we'd thought. Even in the midst of something more powerful that we can do or even have a chance at right now, \"We don't need to be there,\" we've learned.\n\nThe characters who made it into such movies have their own personal stories and realities that make movies seem more real than they are.\n\nSo what better place for a film critic to write a story about dying in real life than in the afterlife? When I worked on a project that was at first made out of a man who fell in love with his mother, one of the reasons I wanted to make this movie was to show readers that our story ends in real life.\n\nI had to imagine real life. When I was getting a job as a writer, I was struggling to get used to being alive. My editor didn't know any better.\n\nI was able to find some way to communicate this feeling of being alive when my editor, John Revere, suggested we write the story in the presence of a narrator who, through the dialogue, was able to tell the story for the first time.\n\nWhen I thought about how that could be accomplished, and my wife suggested that I do it, I was surprised that in the movie it would use this technique.\n\nA little less than five years later, Robert Zemeckis has adapted the screenplay for the new film and, in keeping with Zemeckis' writing style, it's set in the United States. In this film, three people, four girls and a boy, have to cope with the deaths of their parents due to a disease that causes severe brain damage. The disease leaves the children with a terrible condition known as schizophrenia. With the help of a surgeon and a therapist, the children go through treatment.\n\nIf the story of this movie is real, it will live in real life because it can be told in a way that is not afraid of death.\n\nThe film will be screened at a live theater this evening and on Friday, June 19 in the Denny's downtown and at the Ritz Carlton in downtown Chicago.","token_len":573,"entropy":[8.7394,3.5934,3.5569,5.1619,6.7543,0.0182,5.2859,5.6056,4.2088,0.0476,3.1527,4.2464,6.5717,0.4804,12.5556,0.3317,13.8021,2.7698,1.4999,5.5949,5.1766,6.8009,3.957,3.2163,1.7048,0.9702,2.5335,3.5191,6.0939,3.2233,1.7863,1.6391,1.2183,1.1875,0.8522,0.8247,4.0809,2.4529,1.2134,0.3083,0.7919,0.2637,0.6266,0.2416,0.511,0.2316,2.1177,0.4562,0.5595,0.1578,0.4581,4.2294,0.041,3.4289,4.0628,1.5049,3.2414,2.6962,0.7519,5.5797,0.6812,2.8806,2.1173,3.7296,1.7642,2.7095,5.9078,4.5129,0.4273,6.4646,0.5832,3.1635,5.7723,5.9139,1.7266,5.1791,3.7307,4.4413,1.1512,2.4687,3.4101,5.2896,1.0744,5.23,1.3689,3.2954,2.2387,4.5901,1.5051,1.2098,5.7434,1.9704,1.3597,1.9579,5.2033,0.6943,1.3739,0.0003,3.6156,2.2653,4.192,0.7331,2.1531,6.0784,1.5209,1.3685,2.0814,2.6046,3.807,4.8219,2.2554,5.261,0.7132,3.9161,3.4803,1.7441,3.9943,0.0372,4.6311,3.2223,0.979,2.8635,4.41,1.3188,0.8785,0.0027,2.057,2.2094,2.5796,0.0298,7.0108,1.6217,5.0833,4.1326,4.7564,3.1599,2.0665,6.6865,3.0905,4.0561,4.3977,2.7982,4.1091,6.5825,7.0594,5.0226,1.0944,6.2078,3.4382,0.9859,3.2273,0.0006,5.6359,5.5674,5.0957,4.6053,2.8972,3.5223,3.9294,5.6867,3.9332,3.9515,3.1711,2.0291,1.6236,6.7042,0.4473,0.4224,4.3829,3.6114,3.3957,0.0004,2.2513,0.7544,2.2701,3.1094,3.2077,1.4399,4.452,4.2991,0.8779,1.0442,0.0002,2.3772,4.3963,3.2853,5.2043,1.8608,2.2494,7.1014,5.6117,3.2435,3.8342,0.9363,3.6887,1.0052,2.1369,7.1289,1.6584,2.6746,7.8644,5.3735,1.994,2.3154,1.3905,0.4496,1.8336,0.3343,1.9273,0.0002,4.232,2.7883,6.4611,2.9366,2.6387,1.6305,2.9488,8.6403,0.489,2.8655,1.4858,2.8276,0.7337,6.7879,3.3639,5.053,0.2477,0.2873,1.9553,1.6,2.3714,0.245,5.1151,1.8635,6.1275,0.9823,2.8394,4.0566,2.3646,1.94,5.3966,3.8659,6.1939,3.5075,0.1734,1.7259,5.1621,1.5931,5.6691,1.1831,0.0396,0.2608,1.4148,4.1757,1.1571,4.6834,0.3213,0.5178,4.3126,0.725,2.7539,0.1487,2.4572,2.1268,1.7194,0.2344,1.5702,3.2153,7.089,1.5257,4.1965,3.9103,6.0753,1.6494,2.876,0.1992,0.6633,1.467,0.0002,2.4971,3.3302,2.3047,5.9991,6.6674,0.7086,1.9063,4.1123,0.5471,1.9334,5.2539,3.5864,2.9221,1.526,0.3176,1.5603,1.0282,0.5858,1.7987,5.3231,0.8206,2.2495,6.3468,0.005,2.7467,3.6741,0.8871,3.3249,4.5879,4.9261,0.0006,2.0275,5.0007,0.4061,0.9451,3.1879,0.0001,1.7792,1.9279,5.0327,0.0057,3.741,3.2575,4.7919,0.3022,5.5122,2.8213,2.8151,1.7837,1.9264,0.4675,5.0527,3.9451,1.4152,3.2236,4.3461,6.51,5.8156,0.0848,3.9922,3.3193,2.3734,2.726,1.4651,1.5692,1.6886,6.0411,0.0037,1.4349,6.2985,1.5133,4.3581,4.6768,2.3461,6.1939,0.8172,3.1896,1.43,0.0042,2.0491,1.2729,0.5191,4.8799,2.3055,2.2037,0.0045,0.9315,1.0514,0.0001,3.6532,0.9446,4.8482,0.6561,2.356,3.396,2.7607,1.1105,3.4548,0.2756,4.1773,5.4787,5.5304,5.0106,1.0313,1.4857,2.995,0.9108,1.1584,0.6583,2.2418,3.7989,2.4371,5.7231,1.286,4.0189,2.5834,3.0421,6.2359,3.6038,4.9569,0.6535,1.4188,0.0001,4.4081,4.4697,4.8629,0.6903,3.0702,0.9117,0.6013,0.1438,6.4776,4.0495,0.0378,0.0001,0.0,3.1343,5.2606,0.9602,2.3861,1.1729,1.4183,3.6692,1.2717,2.2492,3.9964,2.3039,5.3413,0.0092,3.6334,0.015,0.0004,0.0025,0.1702,5.6788,0.3079,0.1239,2.7633,0.9768,3.8425,0.4737,1.0612,5.9004,0.0604,0.7475,3.3988,2.342,2.8942,0.1743,6.1024,2.1233,2.9762,4.9229,4.8064,0.8723,0.9503,1.2152,0.5768,2.755,2.1034,4.1302,0.0266,1.1533,5.3618,0.0816,0.3028,1.1323,6.7524,0.0061,2.0853,5.3899,1.2258,2.5904,4.5806,2.9059,0.4962,0.6715,2.2755,5.9105,6.422,1.8714,2.1911,1.2902,1.7702,4.0686,4.1711,2.421,0.0122,4.0841,0.6957,5.5608,1.2101,0.1327,0.0013,1.1572,5.0168,2.2803,0.8479,4.0019,0.3925,1.2547,2.1263,4.8211,1.3848,5.8381,2.9429,1.0063,0.0002,5.1546,2.7493,1.6149,2.1745,2.875,2.6213,1.2683,7.0116,0.4018,1.3322,2.5744,5.0058,2.7092,2.8623,0.7561,4.3279,1.411,4.3328,1.8384,1.3031,1.0773,2.176,0.8679,0.1234,1.9484,2.6323,4.4284,1.5051,1.8087,0.4642,1.0351,0.0002,2.1591,2.866,2.7179,1.5895,3.6452,0.6333,3.3699,5.004,2.2477,3.5518,4.5126,2.2771,3.5316,3.0634,1.4774,3.6482,3.3343,4.2072,2.4299,6.0646,3.201,0.6556,7.1259,6.4217,1.4842,1.1181,5.0868,0.6942,1.8366,1.3993,1.9452,3.4589,0.1934]}
{"id":2433,"ended":false,"length":517,"text":"Working with escalating detail, the final result is a product that I'm very proud of. I've got to say, it's the best, most practical, and fun product I've ever worked with.\n\nI've built your own software (i.e. \"Cargo\" on the desktop), but the software has limitations. If you want to see how the software handles this problem, check out my web-based presentation on the use of CSA templates. That's what I'd like you to use!\n\nYou said you had never built anything before. What was the process for moving everything to CSA as you realized how to use it?\n\nYeah, i think i started with a software that we were really proud of. I've started using CSA more than once to implement many things on my existing project that we can do in our web site that our friends have been working on since we first started building our site.\n\nWhat tools did you use for developing your product?\n\nI use the same tools I've found to build and maintain a web site, as well as to make websites. Our project is a mixture of both.\n\nWhat is the process of making your product?\n\nWe started with a website. Our goal at the time was to bring more people on board when we wanted to go more \u201cmobile\u201d into the market for business.\n\nWhat would you like your customer base to grow to?\n\nWe are looking into a new market by offering additional features such as a website that can display pictures of the products and service provided by the company.\n\nWhat are your goals for your firm?\n\nWe are looking to expand our marketing and product development capability. If you think your products can be used for other purposes, we may be interested in purchasing of your product or service to be used for other purposes.\n\nWhat is the most difficult challenge you face to do your job?\n\nWhen I start my job in the next 3-6 years, there are still a lot of times that I have to solve a problem or two. However, working in the same way that I usually do, I find my hardest challenge is when I try to solve a problem or two myself at work.\n\nWhat do you want to accomplish with your business?\n\nI have always wanted to be a marketing expert. I am a member of a professional group so I tend to focus my efforts on those aspects of my business that interest me and I feel like the right role to occupy.\n\nIf you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. | Source: www.battlestarr.com\/battlestarr\/","token_len":573,"entropy":[4.101,13.3482,9.6569,1.2154,2.2605,5.944,2.9216,0.9765,1.3409,5.1054,0.4784,4.207,2.2485,2.2252,0.8703,0.0898,0.5612,2.1708,2.3635,3.8354,3.26,0.9276,1.4754,1.7545,0.5629,3.3353,1.0879,4.8694,1.1335,6.1577,2.0996,1.4598,5.3749,2.8835,0.4462,0.1056,0.2363,2.1841,0.6886,0.7308,1.2289,0.0014,2.3165,1.8687,5.4131,6.8919,3.7286,5.495,5.112,5.1689,0.3415,0.0003,0.9184,5.4711,4.6952,5.4161,2.6141,3.6881,2.711,4.5668,1.7926,2.985,3.0032,3.7464,3.2968,6.4258,0.6487,3.6631,0.3876,1.8393,0.3301,4.224,1.5264,2.8395,2.0661,3.4103,5.3675,2.3335,0.3166,2.5074,0.0638,1.6178,5.718,3.5102,0.8408,5.1381,1.7284,2.0337,5.0235,0.1171,2.8036,6.116,8.664,0.9992,5.6555,0.9921,3.1498,0.7625,4.4687,1.2107,2.287,0.0313,4.1203,3.5254,0.3493,0.0002,3.6906,7.6054,1.3054,3.331,5.1611,3.2294,2.2792,2.5356,0.9951,1.5497,2.4283,1.2608,1.5157,2.0718,6.2768,6.6156,2.0897,2.5572,0.0907,4.9412,2.0231,6.2946,2.6569,2.794,1.8181,0.6576,0.4183,0.17,0.0002,4.8967,0.1977,7.2364,3.5027,2.2994,2.5005,1.9899,1.8896,6.0566,4.3005,4.7618,2.8953,4.6896,2.6492,0.0492,1.0938,2.1962,3.1929,4.8705,2.2142,1.866,0.0442,5.3934,1.3277,2.3206,3.9031,4.6502,4.6619,1.8554,3.37,1.1247,6.9092,3.2219,4.7154,2.7374,4.5976,2.8275,2.2289,2.8094,5.6411,3.3826,5.1266,5.1457,3.5536,2.938,2.8493,1.8792,0.0493,3.6228,2.5249,3.016,0.6776,2.7646,2.3361,2.2918,0.3286,1.3559,0.0001,2.8128,4.8658,1.3272,0.0488,0.2627,2.6502,4.8129,1.3211,3.4968,0.3664,0.2753,0.0002,1.299,2.168,2.6681,4.3663,1.1196,2.4633,3.0269,4.6093,2.773,4.298,3.0102,1.1747,2.9979,2.5082,0.3796,1.9485,3.9047,0.5181,0.0363,3.4918,3.4064,4.7456,1.9953,5.6707,4.0264,1.4742,2.1939,5.3228,0.0264,3.1125,0.7793,1.6905,0.0002,1.6997,2.618,0.8543,2.9528,1.4828,3.3524,1.4256,2.342,1.6979,0.2749,0.0002,2.2471,2.8896,1.4882,1.2415,4.5156,2.1094,3.5424,2.2893,4.7445,0.5154,0.2522,0.0868,0.2329,4.8612,4.6693,2.4016,3.8632,1.0198,6.1126,0.772,5.6351,0.1884,4.4552,4.3307,14.9215,5.9655,7.1551,0.9399,8.6205,6.0691,0.824,4.4733,4.0291,5.449,1.0709,1.9488,0.0002,1.408,4.6587,0.4726,1.6116,3.4769,5.1873,1.4593,0.0451,5.3485,1.5509,1.0436,0.1307,0.0002,1.3217,2.9112,2.4831,4.6737,2.5124,3.9279,2.4368,4.8977,3.8543,5.9999,2.1524,3.2701,0.0035,2.7843,5.1707,2.4067,2.8901,5.149,5.5823,1.5038,2.8672,2.9074,2.4246,5.9777,4.1336,1.7047,1.539,1.0957,0.5843,1.0195,0.0002,0.992,1.9619,1.1385,1.9613,0.8209,1.2261,7.9543,0.4894,0.092,0.0001,1.071,1.697,0.6162,1.1642,2.4977,0.4247,4.9013,1.8536,3.0808,1.8442,5.2197,1.6892,4.3744,1.463,3.7522,2.2942,3.952,2.7126,1.7563,2.3009,2.2792,3.4468,1.0732,0.4897,2.2,5.0469,1.392,1.554,0.4,4.6908,7.2516,1.4356,2.1303,2.5051,1.7395,3.5803,4.27,0.4644,1.5343,1.9235,0.5577,0.3144,0.3494,0.0002,1.0321,1.9828,1.0166,2.7535,2.6119,4.6491,0.8649,1.7796,3.1832,5.2535,2.0457,2.2473,0.8736,0.0988,0.0001,4.1582,1.9637,3.3176,2.5,1.0187,4.0305,1.4977,4.0224,3.8176,1.4777,2.2721,2.3644,0.2965,3.7767,1.1134,4.782,1.2928,0.2894,0.0196,4.4805,2.309,0.425,1.5962,0.0899,4.3809,1.9965,0.8521,3.0397,3.6936,1.119,4.7687,0.0497,5.7548,2.445,1.5708,3.2374,4.7393,2.7788,0.6798,5.4455,0.3471,1.4159,0.9966,2.9446,4.0946,6.4487,1.4473,0.5607,3.8715,0.7893,3.6862,0.1608,1.4958,1.0364,0.2769,3.2478,0.2403,4.549,5.9889,1.9749,0.2676,0.7656,0.0002,1.3942,2.6136,0.0298,3.1151,0.977,2.4019,1.1247,0.1676,2.6104,0.3531,0.0811,0.0002,1.2994,3.0992,3.1826,1.0937,0.0888,1.6939,0.544,4.6523,3.4917,0.9165,0.9504,3.349,1.9613,6.1732,0.0081,2.4008,3.2559,2.4907,6.2651,0.6197,5.9513,0.017,2.754,2.6922,1.6247,0.3276,4.7321,4.1493,1.0481,1.0326,1.9731,0.8145,4.9294,0.0785,3.2385,3.0421,4.0286,1.772,3.4434,4.3758,4.6206,1.1526,5.403,2.1026,0.4938,0.0002,3.6162,0.1553,2.2287,7.7587,2.4095,8.2779,2.9912,0.9612,3.5669,3.1298,3.9816,7.5306,0.0128,5.9191,1.0418,1.5007,4.6266,5.1361,0.0114,0.4377,0.4271,0.3085,0.2708,2.7094,1.0711,0.0904,8.0846,5.9047,0.1306,2.4617,3.0382,5.8054,5.5893,10.4085,0.7082,10.8068,5.3204,0.531,4.3338,0.0033,4.9806,5.1116,1.9099,8.0522,0.6845,0.2957,1.8853,4.8524,0.2956,0.2148,0.4688,1.4028]}

It also makes the whole presentation too long for the sake of being boring. It makes everything feel like a single screen and I can only make it look like 2 screens because the presentation isn't that complex.

After all, the best part has to be the sound :D\n\nThe second thing is that the new videos \"have a more realistic look\" and it \"gets more technical and interesting\". I do like this though, that there are some things more technical in the new videos but there is no \"more technical\".\n\nYou can only watch a certain length of time for each video and every time you want to go on with the video, it needs to be in the correct position to enjoy them. The biggest thing is that as long as you can keep the channel running after 10 minutes or so it will take longer to actually enjoy them.

So I really hope that this change makes the old videos of this sort better, because this could be really important.","token_len":575,"entropy":[12.9358,5.0822,3.94,12.5327,9.7744,7.2525,0.5946,7.6384,10.3737,0.0925,1.6277,2.7153,6.2758,6.3209,0.1292,2.1157,7.187,5.1168,8.6447,1.1772,4.8406,2.5908,6.6044,0.641,1.2488,3.7966,2.4754,0.8386,2.965,0.3461,2.8597,0.0142,3.6593,4.3116,3.1695,1.2155,4.7014,1.1739,2.8185,4.858,0.7747,5.6218,2.6778,4.4086,3.0151,1.9933,5.6469,5.9659,1.092,4.8164,8.9858,4.7584,1.6003,0.0004,4.1696,2.6688,1.7981,3.3766,5.7174,3.7025,4.6628,1.5917,1.8678,2.5424,1.0583,3.0656,2.6161,0.441,0.8904,0.3993,2.9376,4.6807,4.4831,3.6284,0.7684,0.5588,1.2625,4.5678,6.7918,1.1795,2.9943,4.2683,1.7712,1.4769,3.405,1.833,4.3591,3.2398,2.9497,1.4587,6.4748,0.0139,3.8618,4.6265,0.6977,3.0775,2.7238,4.2006,2.134,1.411,1.4118,4.6472,4.4263,3.0538,3.1932,2.9716,2.9752,4.8988,1.6009,2.3876,1.1108,4.2738,1.6371,5.6193,2.0734,3.9497,4.2524,0.0008,3.0966,4.908,0.4662,5.2599,3.7798,1.1329,1.8064,3.9211,1.8459,0.5423,5.128,6.0343,1.2137,3.2821,1.8997,4.5689,0.7698,5.5579,3.3309,4.8383,1.2854,4.9834,0.8932,1.2285,1.2898,0.008,3.6291,4.3385,3.7114,4.7625,5.1848,3.4896,0.8745,4.0995,4.7728,5.19,2.5707,2.2271,4.039,0.7636,5.7232,1.3706,0.0995,2.3238,3.7877,3.8904,7.8776,0.893,0.1381,0.6834,3.9567,5.2253,0.8297,0.4638,0.0002,2.082,0.31,2.9675,1.6729,0.3933,1.3941,2.6138,0.333,4.029,4.7875,1.7757,4.609,3.5123,1.2581,1.1354,1.9693,2.9045,2.9127,4.9577,3.4198,4.7242,3.4155,6.0116,0.7842,1.9977,4.7762,2.1229,2.668,4.7719,1.5566,4.6473,4.1137,1.1458,2.6166,2.5303,5.3771,2.5498,2.8532,1.0059,0.9365,0.175,3.2581,3.1275,1.7076,1.9077,2.0484,3.9224,0.9651,1.74,2.2843,0.0002,4.3338,0.8605,5.2699,1.6891,2.5701,3.2585,4.7619,0.3986,3.7305,3.0759,2.7363,0.5295,2.2437,4.6644,1.9904,0.4922,3.8037,0.1755,3.8501,3.4728,4.9507,1.1723,1.4176,0.8615,2.6831,4.6274,0.1549,0.3654,3.4495,1.8371,4.9901,4.4456,2.978,5.6242,4.7784,0.5055,2.656,5.68,2.7427,0.9916,0.523,5.4386,1.5357,0.0101,0.7328,2.4811,3.7749,2.1412,7.2133,3.5113,4.861,6.5099,0.784,2.631,0.7013,3.0309,1.2747,4.6725,2.7694,0.7833,5.3809,2.1244,2.066,0.3488,3.2815,2.7057,4.341,3.6205,0.4773,2.0816,3.8682,3.1035,1.0327,4.7404,0.3472,5.7663,3.3957,4.2595,3.2034,2.3225,1.8552,3.8939,4.5233,1.242,4.2783,2.9136,2.0658,0.6224,0.0002,5.3957,3.2542,0.1022,0.778,2.4545,0.0598,0.0832,0.0125,1.7447,0.5478,0.0005,0.008,0.0055,0.0005,0.0057,0.006,0.0206,0.0052,0.0123,0.0098,0.001,0.0011,0.002,0.0004,0.0025,0.001,0.0005,0.0045,0.0011,0.0325,0.004,0.4505,0.0001,1.8387,0.8533,0.0713,0.0205,0.1078,0.0225,0.0627,0.005,0.0035,0.0393,0.0042,0.0039,0.0077,0.0066,0.0436,0.0035,0.002,0.026,0.0113,0.0115,0.0737,0.0001,0.0732,0.0028,0.0015,0.0054,0.0327,0.0126,0.0011,0.0035,0.0012,0.0011,0.0038,0.0077,0.0016,0.014,0.0063,0.0012,0.002,0.0018,0.0031,0.0014,0.0004,0.0055,0.0013,0.0115,0.0,0.0018,0.0296,0.0058,0.0036,0.0014,0.0066,0.0001,0.0002,0.0047,0.0017,0.0016,0.001,0.0004,0.0069,0.0017,0.001,0.0172,0.0004,0.004,0.0062,0.0053,0.0069,0.0023,0.0014,0.0031,0.002,0.0017,0.0018,0.0014,0.0015,0.0112,0.0026,0.0009,0.0028,0.0014,0.0016,0.0001,0.0048,0.0004,0.0006,0.0549,0.0011,0.0079,0.0018,0.0008,0.0012,0.0011,0.0012,0.0011,0.0091,0.0009,0.001,0.0052,0.0011,0.0026,0.0016,0.0151,0.0025,0.0003,0.0031,0.0025,0.0015,0.002,0.0036,0.0005,0.0035,0.0015,0.0036,0.0045,0.0039,0.0007,0.0008,0.0004,0.0009,0.0008,0.001,0.003,0.0018,0.0019,0.0513,0.0002,0.0013,0.0007,0.0042,0.0041,0.0011,0.0006,0.0008,0.0014,0.0017,0.0847,0.0013,0.1767,0.0001,3.6676,0.0164,0.0109,0.0023,0.0033,0.003,0.0013,0.0004,0.0002,0.0006,0.0055,0.0025,0.0033,0.0051,0.0066,0.0004,0.0009,0.0007,0.002,0.0048,0.0073,0.0039,0.0097,0.0005,0.0015,0.0021,0.001,0.0028,0.0014,0.0031,0.0212,0.0053,0.0012,0.0012,0.0016,0.0006,0.0388,0.0026,0.0009,0.0035,0.0012,0.0008,0.0014,0.0006,0.0013,0.0088,0.0013,0.003,0.0017,0.0013,0.0008,0.002,0.0007,0.0004,0.0013,0.001,0.0038,0.003,0.0025,0.0009,0.0028,0.0008,0.0014,0.0007,0.0301,0.0015,0.0009,0.0008,0.0032,0.0008,0.001,0.0029,0.0011,0.0069,0.0027,0.0005,0.0009,0.06,0.0029,0.0013,0.0031,0.0006,0.0019,0.0019,0.0015,0.0034,0.0023]}
{"id":773,"ended":true,"length":515,"text":"During the final days of World War 3 a group of soldiers discover an item of near mythical rarity- a pack of smokes, still in the cellophane. The soldier, on the other hand, appears to have discovered a much more serious kind of mysterious substance: water. It is thought that a small amount of water can kill a person.\n\nA few months later, four Germans (Sudwamann, Mutter, Niederweisen), from a village near St. Paul-Saint-Jean, make their very first discovery- a bottle of water and five of them later, they reach their city...\n\nWorld War 3 also brings about the beginning of the second century. A group of soldiers from a settlement and the group of mercenaries who work to recover those who have been defeated by the invading German forces take over a military field, which is called the Piazzetta.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, in order for the Germans (Sudwamann) to have a chance at a successful victory over their resistance, the soldiers must swim and dive into a deep lake in order to swim for a few days.\n\nThe first group and the second group of mercenaries (Niederweisen) later recover what they find. After this the group is attacked by numerous defenders and even in the end they are still trapped, because the Germans tried to kill them.\n\nFor all these reasons, one could not but believe that one of the German soldiers (Mutter) was actually killed when he was struck by a sniper.\n\n\"It was the Germans who killed both of the (Berlin) soldiers (Niederweisen) and in the end, by the way, these two (Berlin) soldiers (Niederweisen) were too weak and they could have suffered some minor injuries,\" says the eyewitness, as well as the German ambassador to France.\n\nThe whole ordeal began with the discovery of the bottle of water which is thought to have killed a German. However, after that, the group of mercenaries, whose identity is yet to be ascertained, are allowed to re-enter the area as they were allowed to start an operation during the last days of World War 3.\n\nThe group of mercenaries is thought to have survived and returned to the area after its return from World War 3. After this, they can start a new operation, and, if they succeed, they will be given a new name.\n\nAccording to a report quoted by a local news channel \"eBay\" in the French city of Cannes last year, the group of mercenaries may be even more powerful than before, the report notes. For example, after their escape from the city, the group can return to the village and \"set it back\" in order to recover their lost belongings.","token_len":576,"entropy":[1.9437,5.0401,3.7032,0.1086,4.2784,0.0102,7.8798,6.0691,3.579,0.0622,3.1746,9.9276,2.8999,6.4354,2.8304,8.2977,5.1386,5.8795,7.0145,1.737,6.8408,0.103,10.1633,2.7265,7.4811,2.1817,1.3779,9.1978,3.2525,0.0038,1.5436,1.9018,4.07,2.741,5.5227,1.2406,0.6081,0.0069,0.1141,5.5975,0.4132,1.0217,4.7086,1.2202,4.7421,0.6575,4.2524,5.4646,0.1602,5.2754,1.8008,2.55,7.3458,0.6742,3.574,1.2681,4.3889,0.5238,3.8143,3.4815,2.5186,0.0756,0.5121,2.85,4.5803,1.3119,2.2239,2.3983,1.4793,0.0061,3.8692,3.232,2.153,0.5916,0.7925,6.5292,5.3139,4.1983,5.7117,4.9083,6.2431,4.9738,6.8469,1.3657,4.9185,5.788,0.8447,4.9107,2.0476,0.7017,3.2009,7.1465,3.6348,4.9108,2.6603,2.7854,1.5178,4.5997,1.484,2.8208,5.0779,5.9624,0.3966,3.0433,0.8704,5.3331,1.1891,7.933,0.4169,3.152,3.852,1.1326,3.4081,0.3975,0.4873,3.9802,5.9936,4.3551,2.8338,5.7806,2.3806,2.4855,5.0593,3.0279,7.1729,6.0636,1.1716,0.0005,6.1086,0.0383,0.3482,6.0737,3.2088,2.8657,1.1438,3.9526,0.022,0.9339,5.015,4.8038,1.9057,2.952,1.9579,0.0173,1.8764,2.0362,1.5386,5.5928,6.2235,3.1242,6.2586,1.0749,4.189,2.764,4.7716,3.7186,4.1587,5.9458,2.1803,1.8728,0.9812,6.2178,1.9705,0.638,3.7127,2.2363,1.2696,4.9525,3.4871,1.7901,5.3203,5.2473,2.019,2.9986,0.9587,3.3411,1.2409,5.8012,4.4973,4.0637,4.0337,0.9232,2.226,0.0003,5.6222,0.0066,7.9412,0.608,0.4309,4.1172,2.3834,3.4855,0.6575,3.1164,7.3944,1.9161,0.1283,0.0232,0.0033,0.0005,2.3604,0.1527,3.5141,2.8533,1.1913,1.9797,3.6559,4.4885,2.4345,2.3953,3.4394,6.947,0.4855,1.5798,2.7488,1.3556,7.7539,4.1874,5.16,2.0179,2.6643,2.5944,2.9035,3.2661,0.2049,0.0355,4.1788,3.3969,1.637,2.0617,1.5003,0.8156,2.3043,0.0003,1.967,3.9256,4.1278,6.2659,0.9885,2.2486,0.9643,1.2522,2.4426,3.6388,1.3283,0.013,0.0056,0.0049,0.0025,0.4676,5.7396,6.1529,4.9222,0.8049,2.7076,1.7598,2.9669,3.1897,3.105,1.8716,3.3592,3.7893,0.2719,5.4226,7.8947,1.588,5.3461,5.4829,0.8261,1.349,2.2602,1.4475,5.9453,3.872,3.4693,4.179,1.3086,2.0979,5.5446,0.1233,3.1865,0.3636,1.117,0.8849,0.0002,5.5822,4.1005,3.4274,0.4505,0.5724,4.1798,4.1589,3.2548,7.3001,4.147,0.2756,4.3323,1.0824,0.2817,3.6658,1.0403,2.648,3.7005,0.0112,0.1192,2.0,3.3394,3.3609,3.3959,0.7151,1.6642,5.6166,0.4262,0.6376,5.0854,1.6,0.9053,0.0003,5.1746,3.0755,1.557,2.6117,3.8057,0.4736,2.4479,6.6831,1.1731,3.3884,6.4341,7.7922,0.8709,0.6979,1.9904,3.9787,1.7427,0.022,0.0061,0.0023,0.0027,0.7314,1.5443,5.1403,0.9915,0.334,1.9436,5.7014,1.7231,2.7005,0.3135,6.0393,1.3047,3.0261,2.9942,0.0613,0.4335,0.5655,1.9429,0.4508,0.0146,0.0027,0.0034,0.0011,0.1313,1.4125,6.0182,2.3804,2.4421,2.9781,3.8137,2.5874,5.7298,4.0276,5.6677,0.882,2.1664,2.6533,2.8831,3.4992,2.4455,4.9859,3.9166,0.0261,1.68,3.8589,4.6315,1.1917,2.7628,1.5801,0.3226,0.0002,2.0612,5.9105,3.8422,4.191,1.7073,0.921,3.4916,0.0956,1.1462,1.9025,0.5384,0.0286,3.7154,2.7507,3.8064,0.026,0.6076,4.2664,3.0205,1.2587,3.5281,3.1533,0.1327,3.2577,3.1561,1.1976,0.8585,3.0041,0.8577,1.2188,3.7302,5.5787,4.781,0.9477,4.6862,0.2382,0.0057,4.2078,0.002,0.1401,3.4085,5.2511,0.1087,5.388,0.5186,1.1075,0.4178,3.4448,4.5977,2.1387,2.2133,4.7878,0.3076,6.8485,5.1358,2.46,6.162,0.5979,3.3643,0.8799,0.1175,0.6516,0.0015,0.2649,0.2442,0.2884,0.0002,2.0012,2.7657,0.6804,0.8994,3.0073,5.5501,0.0344,0.3249,4.0875,2.9736,3.6546,0.3824,1.5977,1.4823,1.8576,5.2415,2.8859,3.079,2.1641,0.0016,0.3629,0.6008,3.7827,1.842,0.6642,1.5479,4.9618,3.3309,1.4996,1.2333,2.6156,2.4447,2.7791,4.725,2.8696,0.9402,1.2295,0.4167,1.117,0.9997,1.6592,2.8872,1.312,1.8057,0.9498,1.1508,0.3632,0.0002,3.7416,0.0041,2.9755,2.7988,7.1807,0.3058,3.6537,2.6029,2.3011,3.0054,5.257,8.0814,3.9616,1.5277,2.0869,2.3426,4.207,3.0177,0.0845,5.0529,6.4481,1.336,0.1228,0.8904,0.775,0.4475,0.3373,5.1742,1.8344,5.1564,1.2185,1.9163,0.4555,2.3366,1.9377,5.1778,4.6644,5.1433,0.4036,5.7414,1.3098,0.0584,3.7748,2.6676,3.8105,0.6373,0.6768,2.8301,0.6895,0.9009,0.3346,3.9361,4.528,0.2844,1.123,3.2211,2.0993,4.9998,5.344,5.2667,4.3121,1.6625,2.9869,0.7754,0.0369,3.7357,1.8521,1.6854,2.9682,0.4246]}
{"id":1976,"ended":false,"length":511,"text":"Magic has entered the modern world, bringing an assortment of non-human magical creatures with it. And one of them has just been elected President of the United States.\n\nThe Trump Foundation, an organization of private foundations owned by the Trump family, donated $10 million to the Magic Society of America, a non-profit organization formed by the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner to fund the educational program for Magic Schools.\n\n\u201cIn collaboration with the Trump Foundation, the Magic Society and the Trump Foundation, the Magic Society of America is committed to developing and expanding educational opportunities for children who have been denied access to quality education through STEM training and enrichment programs. The Magic Society\u2019s investment in education and training facilities in the US is to help to improve access for those who need it most,\u201d a statement released by the Foundation read. \u201cWe value the work they do to promote STEM education and support STEM learners in the U.S. in areas such as STEM arts, science, engineering and math education.\u201d\n\nThe Trump Foundation has also pledged $10 million for the \u201cInnovation Program\u201d to further enhance the Magic School\u2019s educational opportunities by focusing on providing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs for children. Magic Schools in the United States (MSU) have been awarded six scholarships totaling $1.3 million.\n\nMagic Schools is a nonprofit group that has long focused on developing \u201chigh-quality\u201d STEM programs for children ages 10 through 6. Since 1993, it has provided approximately 30 high school-level STEM-related courses to the United States. The Magic Society helps to build STEM education programs throughout the United States throughout the year.\n\nThe Magic Society of America also plans to expand this scholarship program so that it can help the school\u2019s science students in the U.S. pursue a career in science and engineering education.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that this administration is proposing to tax the private sector in order to help make the magic money for the Magic School\u2019s education. So it is clear that they want to increase taxes on the private sector so they can make the magic money for kids whose education would be cut if they\u2019re not wealthy,\u201d an editorial from the Washington Post said. \u201cThis would bring down the value of education, because those skills and talents aren\u2019t valued or made available to poor American kids.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, the Trump campaign last month launched a campaign on the behalf of the Magic Society to help promote STEM. In the campaign ads, the president is quoted saying the organization \u201cprovides top-quality STEM education courses to middle and high school students in more than 200 countries.\u201d","token_len":577,"entropy":[5.8124,7.1139,0.8871,5.7541,2.0687,1.7605,5.4372,3.966,5.6032,0.0068,7.1383,0.2044,5.8488,7.1199,2.3563,2.6679,0.98,0.7355,4.4419,5.4934,0.4725,1.5652,3.1175,4.2816,1.6991,5.93,2.1195,0.7079,0.4224,0.3154,0.0626,0.893,0.7674,0.0004,2.5179,5.7951,5.7736,1.8075,3.5675,0.8437,3.5717,5.6756,1.7999,5.1148,0.2322,1.5029,1.1265,0.7176,0.339,4.9281,0.6783,3.0661,0.227,0.4361,0.9385,10.1042,3.0441,1.6905,0.3876,1.6624,1.01,2.2579,0.0143,0.0303,0.6626,4.2767,1.1813,1.2656,3.6717,15.339,7.4424,4.1993,1.7315,3.6661,0.0012,0.0024,0.0005,0.9889,2.9345,0.6384,0.9527,0.004,2.5822,3.6232,1.4003,6.3524,2.8174,2.6197,4.0349,5.3481,0.9541,0.8319,0.0002,6.0127,6.1633,5.2707,7.7415,0.0087,0.8156,1.5858,0.5109,0.1393,0.6048,2.0895,0.0227,4.0084,0.8975,1.1613,1.7103,2.3794,0.5017,2.0156,0.2487,3.1006,0.019,2.0721,5.2307,0.0065,3.9977,1.5939,3.205,3.3807,1.4677,0.2844,1.2927,3.9712,2.3006,2.952,3.6862,1.1259,0.0314,5.051,1.5728,3.5567,8.532,3.4573,1.6151,5.3115,0.4982,0.4734,2.2199,0.9083,0.0193,6.6541,1.3065,0.0586,6.4266,0.7838,3.9015,2.2346,3.1845,5.8413,2.3472,1.4205,3.8228,1.3672,4.3988,2.3801,4.1351,3.5036,3.1105,2.8753,3.8616,1.3646,2.0693,0.9955,0.5246,1.8809,8.2121,6.4683,4.9211,3.7824,2.436,0.8687,0.1599,4.0474,5.0238,0.1385,5.8947,0.3007,5.0509,6.0471,1.1567,3.8069,6.5784,0.3425,1.1603,3.208,3.4054,0.3605,1.0499,4.134,2.5102,4.5877,1.9465,1.2374,3.6215,0.0013,0.0007,0.4283,4.5454,5.621,0.6265,0.0021,1.3797,6.3273,0.7788,1.9266,0.3765,1.6167,1.1208,0.5449,2.2763,1.4438,2.8391,2.4645,0.473,0.0002,1.4994,1.8832,0.1188,1.8023,1.7594,3.6678,1.4616,2.1466,0.0554,2.3806,1.1875,11.9403,1.5444,6.0842,3.6392,0.0059,4.631,0.5419,3.5711,2.4245,4.4882,2.8286,1.1693,3.9946,3.7434,7.2692,1.0924,0.1069,1.8635,1.8385,3.4034,4.889,0.1726,5.9442,5.1223,1.4708,0.9215,0.407,0.5738,0.2691,2.137,1.4576,0.0036,0.0778,3.3776,2.2717,1.8677,2.2462,7.8457,1.9608,3.0928,0.6295,1.348,0.0113,5.9926,2.4535,1.9906,0.1467,4.2612,1.6613,3.0564,5.4733,4.6481,2.3065,0.2881,2.3542,0.5446,2.3157,0.0624,2.2611,0.6476,0.0002,5.2793,1.1302,3.4851,1.7036,2.5117,4.4928,1.4847,2.4499,5.7056,3.5981,0.0491,3.351,11.314,0.1246,5.6106,0.8535,0.5147,6.1739,2.2736,1.0318,2.5325,1.0279,0.5255,6.2151,3.599,2.2475,5.2431,0.5527,4.6464,4.6852,0.0719,3.4315,0.0552,2.3257,4.7663,4.0618,3.8599,1.1934,3.0931,1.658,1.3667,3.812,1.0217,3.5234,1.2596,3.2555,1.5492,0.0115,1.4961,1.8377,2.1087,1.7969,6.6442,1.175,3.415,3.3498,1.1256,1.4365,4.6802,0.1247,1.0392,0.0039,7.6065,0.5413,0.9676,1.1055,0.797,0.0002,1.6078,1.3173,0.148,2.3702,0.0078,3.6816,5.6774,0.1041,2.0715,5.2772,5.8485,0.3394,5.3291,0.2254,2.0852,0.9351,3.3677,3.807,4.034,6.9831,0.4244,0.0109,5.7685,3.3343,3.1855,1.3827,2.362,0.0008,0.0008,0.1381,5.6751,2.7323,2.4362,0.1698,1.8105,1.4425,2.9828,3.8468,0.4203,0.8177,0.0002,2.6025,0.3623,4.6028,5.1121,1.6391,0.0514,1.6093,0.6212,0.6742,0.1153,2.6766,7.37,2.0772,4.565,1.1066,5.3202,1.2565,5.67,1.6469,3.413,1.0378,0.0144,3.1137,4.3678,1.8502,4.3767,5.9414,5.2848,0.8218,1.0162,2.8807,2.6208,0.0422,0.0443,1.9355,0.6822,4.9581,3.4758,1.0936,5.1563,0.1659,4.4199,1.8787,0.2096,4.0009,1.8954,0.3138,0.6511,1.4397,0.0494,3.8161,2.2043,0.2447,3.0492,2.0715,1.2938,0.1238,0.9412,7.7617,4.7065,1.8144,5.5571,1.0199,3.3497,3.1885,0.8753,9.6194,0.2878,3.6064,1.4726,5.6568,4.7212,1.2479,2.3427,4.5347,6.0359,1.9227,0.6283,1.9938,0.7944,2.9909,0.3374,3.6254,0.198,2.673,3.0687,5.1941,3.76,0.6426,2.0961,0.1024,4.5706,2.534,4.9403,4.5695,7.7117,2.3595,1.9228,5.2398,0.6523,0.8902,0.0707,2.0796,5.3624,5.1812,0.8277,1.019,5.9232,6.0188,1.9908,0.6747,2.1613,1.7237,0.2583,0.0002,4.9515,0.0154,0.6669,1.7383,0.0191,0.3774,0.7626,2.2634,4.9763,7.5502,1.564,5.0875,0.4797,1.5237,5.218,1.5877,6.8748,0.0017,0.765,0.7186,0.0786,1.1523,3.6045,4.9044,1.0634,4.7154,2.8253,2.1651,2.09,4.4636,0.201,0.8971,3.0133,4.4624,3.6165,1.4341,3.4443,2.9806,5.3397,0.6842,5.6058,0.0181,6.5208,0.5669,0.8721,2.116,0.5737,7.7196,1.3031,5.1105,2.3176,0.3953,0.1184,0.2504,2.1224,6.3561,0.0119,3.1308,1.102,1.4061,3.7718,1.3313]}

Michael Thompson.","token_len":577,"entropy":[11.3389,2.2764,3.1543,8.4181,0.9308,0.3484,2.1658,4.6877,3.6046,6.4952,2.1921,2.5053,3.1944,0.4138,3.9902,0.1968,0.4323,2.2341,1.4769,2.1959,2.6965,1.1008,5.6844,0.5693,3.2018,3.034,2.0741,0.6447,1.3956,0.0059,2.373,5.0411,1.7409,2.0689,3.4769,0.0182,6.1658,3.0579,1.8731,4.4754,0.2303,1.0474,2.6624,0.6309,6.1028,1.7513,1.3164,0.0848,0.0556,1.3063,3.1554,2.0443,6.619,7.4107,0.1853,0.4829,0.5577,5.9794,0.5712,1.5806,5.9758,1.0858,0.4279,4.7754,2.3433,2.6152,2.2859,4.2522,4.1581,4.5001,1.0337,2.2101,2.6649,5.8571,3.357,5.7341,3.5185,5.1753,2.9839,0.1164,0.2913,5.2844,1.4786,6.2876,0.437,4.212,0.6441,0.0061,0.8654,4.4303,4.9185,5.3959,1.5054,3.219,3.393,2.501,6.1772,1.2775,5.9275,0.4951,1.225,3.3814,0.0035,1.2198,3.9743,4.5151,1.1908,0.9783,4.7187,1.524,0.1011,6.8728,5.1764,4.3372,1.9249,3.9837,0.7817,3.4306,3.1803,1.3019,2.9881,4.1019,1.1767,1.6112,6.3518,7.5008,2.468,0.4536,5.5569,1.5751,0.0002,3.464,0.1877,0.0535,0.1206,0.0509,2.8785,1.1647,0.5191,0.0057,1.9732,5.0885,1.1021,3.5494,3.895,5.1473,0.829,3.376,5.2888,0.1453,0.934,7.0086,2.4132,0.9901,3.6082,1.7182,1.8055,2.7127,5.7938,0.3426,0.8767,4.5186,0.074,0.9568,1.3897,1.6065,3.968,1.5654,5.4869,1.6328,2.4911,1.444,4.8575,1.1576,3.6417,6.3025,1.316,4.796,6.1504,1.8143,2.8581,3.4648,3.8078,0.9476,2.761,0.5693,0.6649,4.7557,0.0017,5.8414,0.2712,0.439,5.9832,4.6873,3.7851,2.0353,4.4636,2.3937,1.7858,2.2659,0.7032,2.2923,4.0818,4.2872,1.2858,3.93,0.0534,0.0654,0.0376,0.0616,4.8353,0.0026,2.2833,2.0367,0.893,1.6111,2.6849,2.5245,0.931,2.4624,5.9685,2.1022,2.4328,4.7158,1.6308,1.6336,4.6306,0.5584,4.8508,4.9365,0.0396,3.1758,2.2783,3.7341,5.0616,5.723,1.6057,2.653,0.218,2.0143,1.4831,1.4076,5.5036,0.7569,1.7086,3.7862,2.0339,1.2779,5.8002,1.1972,6.7838,5.6131,1.4653,0.7131,0.0002,3.9816,4.5683,0.0439,3.717,0.6939,0.9112,0.707,0.0415,0.1273,0.0438,0.0084,0.3635,0.0004,0.0015,0.0016,0.0027,0.1992,0.6957,0.0055,0.0437,0.0067,0.0002,0.0255,0.0002,0.0011,0.0123,0.1979,0.0294,0.0016,0.3868,0.8375,0.0071,0.0011,0.0007,0.0093,0.0002,0.0001,0.0006,0.0031,0.0023,0.0158,0.0011,0.003,0.0017,0.0049,0.0014,0.0022,0.0008,0.0098,0.0034,0.0051,0.0016,0.1662,0.0031,0.0013,0.0039,0.0357,0.0179,0.0026,0.0055,0.0026,0.0013,0.0094,0.0022,0.0016,0.0094,0.0014,0.0863,0.0036,0.0017,0.0008,0.0015,0.0007,0.0035,0.0018,0.0004,0.0022,0.0004,0.0005,0.0024,0.0006,0.0002,0.0066,0.0028,0.0439,0.0563,0.0046,0.001,0.0032,0.018,0.005,0.0012,0.0024,0.0009,0.0007,0.0028,0.5053,0.0001,2.0022,1.7204,0.3698,0.5752,0.1478,0.0008,0.0221,0.0022,0.0301,0.0038,0.0006,0.0226,0.0033,0.0022,0.0191,0.0003,0.0007,0.0004,0.0031,0.0066,0.0016,0.001,0.0035,0.0016,0.0003,0.0036,0.0001,0.0005,0.0019,0.0037,0.0012,0.001,0.0021,0.0204,0.0024,0.0012,0.0004,0.035,0.0001,0.0,0.0006,0.0017,0.0027,0.0186,0.0012,0.0011,0.0014,0.0037,0.0003,0.0004,0.0006,0.0042,0.0025,0.0017,0.0011,0.0078,0.0009,0.0007,0.0028,0.0096,0.0116,0.0042,0.0025,0.0016,0.0012,0.0081,0.0022,0.0012,0.0081,0.0017,0.0494,0.0008,0.001,0.0006,0.0009,0.0009,0.003,0.0015,0.0004,0.0012,0.0002,0.0002,0.0014,0.0007,0.0003,0.0112,0.0049,0.0173,0.0043,0.003,0.0011,0.0025,0.0107,0.0064,0.0014,0.0036,0.0009,0.0005,0.0054,0.1214,0.0001,2.4467,0.0869,0.0068,0.0015,0.0103,1.1968,0.573,0.1261,0.0009,0.1514,0.3936,0.0232,0.0114,0.0002,0.0022,0.0042,0.0084,0.0013,0.0009,0.0255,0.0926,0.0029,0.0042,0.0203,0.008,0.0705,0.0481,0.0018,0.0049,0.0034,6.3034,0.0216,0.0933,0.1098,0.024,0.0256,0.0553,0.5597,0.0172,0.0184,0.0076,0.0039,0.002,0.0067,0.0059,0.0029,0.0735,0.0041,0.0027,0.0834,0.0059,0.0006,0.0013,0.0022,0.0005,0.0028,0.0019,0.0004,0.003,0.0003,0.0003,0.0034,0.0013,0.0033,0.0032,0.0094,0.0006,0.0016,0.0051,0.0011,0.103,0.0104,0.0008,0.0082,0.0201,0.0004,0.0009,0.0004,0.003,0.0117,0.0005,0.0015,0.0017,0.003,0.0039,0.0136,0.0046,0.0032,0.0032,0.002,0.0028,0.0027,0.0035,0.0016,0.0016,0.0058,0.0006,0.0045,0.0042,0.0003,0.0013,0.0017,0.0023,0.0024,0.0309,0.0009,0.0005,0.0006,0.0013,0.0028,0.0008,0.0001,0.0007,0.0007,0.0012,0.0018,0.0012,0.0022,0.0003,0.0056,0.0013,0.0037]}

Well now there are 1-2 drug combinations every doctor would prescribe for you. So keep reading to find the answer.

Just buy the next one you need and make sure you understand what you are getting into because by all means, give drugs 3-5 times a week! Be careful.\n\n1. Don't use \"snort more than you need\" or \"give more than you need\". Instead, use what you use, which may include food, water, water, alcohol and tobacco.\n\n2. Keep your medications out of the reach or in your pocket. No, don't take them in the house unless it's the nearest public toilet or emergency rooms.\n\n3. Don't use any alcohol while you are using. I recommend getting a \"Brent\" Tincture before using it.\n\n4. Don't eat any more than you have been drinking right until after your cycle begins. I recommend this for when your body is feeling too low to drink alcohol.\n\n5. Don't use your mouth (like me) after you have had a few drinks or sleep in. Drink something like the beer, wine and cookies.\n\n6. If you are not feeling well and need a rest, take some caffeine. Drink a cup of tea or coffee. If you think alcohol is getting you high, don't drink it.\n\n7. Don't get pregnant for the first time.\n\n8. Don't let her go back to school if she needs help. Your baby should get along very well with all the other children.\n\n9. Don't start at the beginning.\n\n10. Don't keep sleeping on any bed. Never sleep in an empty room and you are probably going to get sick from doing so.\n\n11. If you do find yourself taking drugs and sleeping, you probably won't have the opportunity to talk or move on. You need to focus on keeping those things in a place that can be seen. Like an art gallery.\n\n12. Don't put drugs in your blood. In every patient, use different medications.\n\n13. You should never take the medicines before they have been given to you. This can lead to nausea, vomiting and other problems.","token_len":578,"entropy":[9.4316,3.8216,10.0108,8.0216,0.1616,2.2717,2.6926,2.5891,1.4559,4.6812,6.4597,2.6574,5.3817,6.9915,0.0832,2.9646,1.4732,6.7185,3.9076,9.2673,12.9617,3.8395,6.3342,0.8419,2.6417,4.0454,10.0884,0.0401,3.8583,6.7066,0.6253,1.5636,4.5051,2.0171,0.0334,2.491,2.5094,1.1934,2.2386,0.0024,0.0007,0.1196,0.0718,0.0317,0.0366,0.0527,0.0005,0.0008,0.004,0.0011,0.0041,0.0012,0.0018,0.0042,0.0031,0.051,0.1506,0.0005,0.005,0.0026,0.0006,0.0013,16.0428,0.4017,0.1482,0.0023,0.0069,0.2038,1.9508,0.0003,4.3843,2.3416,6.3329,2.7841,6.3567,3.4779,5.385,4.7233,1.7939,5.7385,4.497,1.0732,5.7584,3.9895,5.3422,6.7529,5.2282,1.5749,2.6436,0.7063,0.4841,4.0319,6.0131,3.1708,1.947,0.6497,2.9413,4.5201,1.2433,6.1768,6.8309,1.9379,4.8034,1.5849,4.1738,2.4326,1.763,4.3506,0.5146,0.8566,5.0951,1.354,1.3446,0.6033,1.3923,0.9079,5.4252,5.6763,5.1381,0.1104,1.0783,4.2447,7.2389,6.9384,1.6539,1.1661,0.7664,0.6552,1.1394,4.2749,6.5752,2.0078,3.2271,1.4016,0.0005,4.4944,3.9273,0.0962,0.2503,0.012,0.0033,0.0016,0.0044,0.027,0.0154,0.0019,0.0004,0.0007,0.0009,0.0017,0.0009,0.0009,0.0003,0.0022,0.0013,0.0042,0.0018,0.0024,0.001,0.0007,0.0024,0.0009,0.0046,0.0006,0.0005,0.0069,0.0019,0.0036,0.001,0.0008,0.0006,0.0035,0.0024,0.005,0.0038,0.0134,0.0021,1.0161,0.0002,4.3884,1.2107,4.5876,0.0099,3.3036,5.0096,5.3284,4.0056,7.6139,1.4248,2.2104,1.2927,1.1972,2.1953,0.5661,4.5161,1.0565,0.4012,0.1007,0.6352,1.6341,5.4372,0.5772,2.023,3.349,0.5482,5.493,2.6607,4.1689,3.6481,1.4819,5.3122,0.7061,1.7984,0.2903,5.4538,1.8038,4.5041,1.7408,3.6919,0.3336,1.2581,0.0002,1.4244,0.001,3.6325,1.9392,3.7935,3.097,0.0367,1.0372,2.2528,5.189,3.4078,1.6092,2.9812,0.6581,5.4918,3.4727,2.2877,0.0005,2.6019,1.6386,2.7279,1.1167,3.8044,3.8943,3.2006,0.7181,3.6586,7.9993,6.0776,2.8002,2.054,4.1884,6.0148,0.3409,0.9069,0.0002,0.2773,0.0011,1.7191,0.0002,1.9538,3.0687,4.258,4.5929,1.1966,0.7318,3.3865,1.6004,4.9492,4.2963,3.7503,1.6977,5.0844,5.8657,8.8515,1.8815,5.5238,1.4928,0.0058,4.5986,2.6612,2.4053,0.737,1.032,0.0002,0.3006,0.0012,1.3645,0.0003,4.3888,2.608,4.4725,0.3874,0.2352,4.2912,3.7043,3.277,6.0566,5.9551,3.9645,2.543,7.8914,3.5649,0.2572,3.0431,1.4974,4.741,2.9103,4.6616,2.5107,1.9896,1.0024,4.147,3.6525,4.375,2.3818,3.0305,4.0323,0.7176,0.4876,0.0002,0.2097,0.0012,1.0996,0.0002,1.782,3.3917,4.951,5.36,5.0511,5.6672,0.4297,4.6062,1.2329,1.0528,2.4791,1.1073,3.5692,1.1108,2.8296,7.5177,3.2882,1.8202,5.1508,5.2715,2.7898,4.8973,7.2254,2.5064,2.1141,2.5768,5.3701,1.9894,0.9197,0.0002,0.449,0.0017,3.3,0.2114,1.5269,3.6538,2.3552,1.0277,2.5199,2.5018,1.8517,2.6771,0.3436,2.9898,2.2416,4.7208,1.3766,4.7966,2.1162,1.9851,0.5294,2.7537,1.2758,1.3865,1.9346,3.238,0.2681,5.2726,7.6263,1.0107,3.2624,1.5167,3.3505,0.2756,3.4789,0.0005,1.9227,1.2731,0.376,0.788,0.0002,0.2201,0.0019,1.644,0.0003,3.5106,4.2929,5.5045,3.0509,0.6245,1.4737,0.6686,3.1868,0.0002,0.3378,0.0015,1.2222,0.0004,4.5064,6.903,3.0884,5.1574,0.3622,3.8586,3.2591,0.7602,3.9505,2.4331,0.5306,5.563,3.5459,2.4781,3.4371,6.4262,3.7661,0.0342,0.3009,4.5416,1.3322,0.8328,2.8393,1.2001,0.4748,0.0002,0.2054,0.0016,0.8983,0.0003,5.0373,5.8413,2.5063,1.8781,1.5712,2.2564,0.0002,0.0877,0.0018,0.7887,0.0003,5.3788,5.7153,2.4882,4.9966,3.6582,1.5046,5.5734,3.835,2.0416,3.9009,1.7176,1.4742,4.0573,4.6438,2.5936,3.2883,1.7192,0.041,1.5528,2.531,3.6732,4.8574,0.1868,0.1708,0.3824,0.0002,0.227,0.0015,3.0614,0.2804,3.772,4.2798,0.6847,4.3637,2.0879,3.0492,4.2709,3.3654,3.099,3.4393,3.0149,0.0018,2.6601,2.815,6.3038,0.1334,4.8552,4.356,6.0925,3.4684,1.2423,2.997,3.4204,0.2471,4.3972,0.2389,5.761,5.7278,2.1313,2.0727,4.1599,2.348,0.7771,4.1144,1.7199,5.6705,2.6271,7.2146,3.7468,5.7337,0.509,1.3985,0.7467,0.0003,0.2629,0.0017,1.3203,0.0002,4.0858,3.5547,0.5117,0.4258,4.5773,0.7766,4.5391,7.47,5.4641,1.4121,5.5461,5.9685,2.0067,1.008,1.907,0.0002,0.2342,0.0019,4.2855,2.1647,2.1613,2.0574,3.456,4.8264,6.1044,3.1512,2.6374,0.613,1.4384,1.1793,0.072,0.3036,3.0505,2.701,2.1941,0.0281,4.521,0.71,0.7531,0.8123,3.0362,1.9003,0.3701]}
{"id":690,"ended":true,"length":517,"text":"When you begin to fall in love with your soulmate, you begin to gain shared projected knowledge, feelings, and experience, as well as an understanding of a person's physical and physical personality, and of the relationship, its meaning, and overall personality. It's important to connect with your soulmate in your current position \u2013 to establish intimacy and connection \u2013 and understand the concept of love.\n\nThe basic idea behind love is to love someone, and to show love. It's important to understand that if you and your spouse are feeling lonely and lonely, you should not only be open to your romantic feelings and support (i.e., the support of sex, communication), because you want to understand who you are as your soulmate. This may make it easier for others to understand you better, which in turn enables a relationship to make more sense for you and your spouse.\n\nDuring the first half-hour of the session, participants were given access to a large sample of their intimate secrets. I highly recommend this method that should be included in any ongoing work for a partner. For anyone looking for secret-to-love secrets, please call (716) 893-4036.\n\nI encourage users to use the information found in this publication in order to better understand the relationship\u2014whether it's in person or at home\u2014and to use these secret secrets to more effectively present and understand one another.\n\nThe relationship above is not necessarily related to, and is not intended to be, a marriage between a man and a woman and therefore is not a \"fatal flaw\" regarding intimacy. The research and discussion used to present this research is based on professional and personal relationships.\n\nI strongly recommend using this method that should be included in any ongoing work for a partner. For anyone seeking to implement secrets in the relationship, consult with a lawyer and\/or financial adviser to understand the risks of implementing this research for the best result for you and your partner.\n\nIf you're interested in sharing any secrets about your relationship, or even if you do not want the research to lead to an understanding of who you are, please call (800) 893-4036.\n\nThe work in this article is presented for informational purposes only, and should not be interpreted as an offer to provide professional or financial advice.

{"id":3580,"ended":true,"length":543,"text":"In the final episode of Top Gear, a hearing to decide which presenter gets custody of the Stig.\n\nThe judge who presided yesterday decided that the prosecution of a jury was not \"fair, reasonable and consistent.\" It will ask for a two year ban on Stig's licence.\n\nThat decision \"appears to be quite sensible for those of us who are concerned about public safety,\" the judge said.\n\n\"If Mr Stig continues to remain in custody, our legal team and the Court of Appeal and the UK Crown Court will look closely at this decision and consider whether the use of public safety as an excuse to suspend his licence is fair or reasonable.\"\n\nIt was a relatively modest decision. The judge asked them to \"consider the fact that his behaviour was significantly more serious than those we are concerned about while away from the court\", and that he considered that there was no evidence the trial judge and his team had ever conspired to harm Stig.\n\nLast year, Judge John Brown sentenced Stig to 16 months in prison in prison for his part in a car bomb killing of a British citizen and his subsequent kidnap. In 2011 he was jailed for eight years and two months for the first of three counts of manslaughter, but he served his sentence in February 2014. A year later, he was released.\n\nIn January, the court heard how a policeman in the Stig's London home was stabbed to death in July 2010.\n\nStig also has nine other other cases where police have charged him for unlawful wounding and illegal possession of dangerous drugs, including a murder charge linked to the murder of another British tourist.\n\nThe judge did not call into question the merits of the charges against Stig, saying it was too soon to say if the charges were to be dropped. But a panel of judges including the prosecution's barrister said they were \"a large group\" of people who had had time to see the cases.\n\nMost importantly, it noted that the charges against Stig had to do with the death of a man who was killed after he got into a car with four other people who were leaving at around 19.30pm on 26 February 2010.\n\nThe court was told it was an offence for a police officer to \"do an illegal exercise of command or emergency services to engage in or to conduct an act in violation of the Public Order Act\". It made no mention of the police or its officers involved in the car bombing.\n\nThe defence said Stig's sentence \"gave the police the power to have a conviction for an offence and to suspend or extend the licence of officers who have carried out offences committed with the purpose of threatening the public\".\n\nThe ruling came after it was reported in January that Stig had not been given a chance to comment as an accused. The prosecution has appealed.","token_len":579,"entropy":[2.6222,5.191,3.8005,0.7489,8.4221,0.8916,0.3345,3.7978,9.8646,4.1777,2.4576,2.9518,5.1104,4.175,10.1621,0.3261,1.0063,8.7695,3.2812,3.9875,1.1207,0.0005,2.2657,3.9964,4.344,2.4516,9.3622,5.1721,1.0797,1.9361,6.4715,5.0807,4.1624,5.8738,2.9578,1.8286,3.9678,3.4556,3.16,4.1715,0.7033,4.517,4.0926,3.9693,4.2,5.7159,1.8038,1.1735,4.9509,4.5341,3.7686,0.5686,4.1889,0.0185,3.0349,3.4988,1.3252,0.4036,0.0004,5.3878,2.1234,5.9338,4.5164,0.4482,0.3757,1.1634,5.2109,5.2523,3.5633,4.0313,2.9082,0.0379,0.4223,2.1101,2.7432,0.5429,3.5807,0.2765,1.5382,3.1645,1.3896,0.4914,0.2649,0.2563,0.0003,1.8835,3.7431,4.6886,0.9455,0.0321,5.0315,0.3148,4.2909,1.0403,1.3821,1.2295,4.9562,4.31,1.2862,3.6423,1.3233,5.188,1.1846,0.0493,5.0019,0.8816,5.8507,5.0088,4.9411,0.5828,4.4277,5.1064,0.182,1.9445,1.8801,1.2306,2.3228,1.4353,2.1978,5.0422,0.0424,5.1695,3.567,1.4278,2.0599,0.5051,1.2822,4.5123,2.2883,0.0559,1.2611,2.8117,2.9684,0.8742,0.4176,0.1864,0.0003,3.7908,2.0723,3.0451,6.4593,4.0923,1.8209,1.9403,1.9915,2.6145,5.2182,7.7631,0.482,3.1003,1.5794,1.2017,4.5658,0.0911,4.7901,2.7997,2.2175,6.8164,2.201,2.6782,0.6571,2.8626,4.0768,3.0172,3.3823,0.3733,6.6058,6.7506,0.4357,1.3049,4.2399,3.6935,1.2048,1.9627,2.2079,4.5831,2.2878,3.1337,0.4762,2.0731,1.7586,3.0701,4.7464,1.3205,4.925,2.0563,2.5876,1.0943,4.4218,6.9482,0.1762,0.7439,4.3114,0.99,0.001,0.4806,0.1378,0.0003,5.6487,1.4474,0.6311,4.6176,4.3624,5.5722,4.6101,2.019,0.002,0.1943,4.8877,0.2116,0.5849,0.674,4.0362,6.3828,0.7898,2.9382,1.9373,0.0265,1.0361,3.2741,3.5609,4.9203,1.3806,1.2338,3.0911,3.7774,2.8953,2.1465,6.5943,7.1718,1.5496,3.9664,3.5548,2.482,0.4278,2.4651,0.068,3.5203,0.5463,2.4182,3.3764,0.3732,0.6066,2.6582,5.4413,2.9774,1.3501,2.7663,0.3068,4.1669,2.263,3.2144,2.4013,4.8751,2.5734,0.9671,1.4947,4.1797,2.7146,0.5683,5.5348,2.5273,0.4352,0.9748,0.8277,0.2583,2.2251,2.354,0.2782,0.0003,2.4781,3.8651,1.2314,1.4447,2.7577,1.7156,3.1908,3.2419,5.1691,2.8718,2.0159,2.0661,0.0823,2.265,6.6402,0.8564,2.213,4.3906,0.9677,0.0011,1.7435,4.0857,3.1183,1.2616,1.8862,0.0002,1.8346,0.0227,4.6398,3.8858,7.3736,2.1366,6.0568,4.8226,2.7832,3.7325,0.6975,4.1818,0.4661,4.008,5.4464,4.3515,2.0951,5.5618,1.1664,0.0563,4.7234,0.5192,1.8732,1.4396,2.1803,4.9563,1.1975,6.3439,0.0551,1.6089,3.1999,0.072,4.8493,2.5728,2.7775,0.903,0.5201,0.0003,1.9468,2.5025,4.8548,0.3153,5.1292,4.5055,0.0182,0.9649,6.6119,0.021,1.0358,3.1506,1.0692,0.5298,0.0016,1.2361,1.8081,2.9081,0.35,2.9752,1.8447,0.0775,1.9926,2.368,1.8171,3.1005,1.4718,5.4962,0.4034,3.0021,0.4768,2.7365,4.6093,6.5921,0.4453,1.1323,5.2965,1.5586,5.0517,1.7126,2.1611,0.0003,2.9034,1.8644,1.4702,1.1772,4.916,6.4075,5.304,1.4836,0.6325,0.7743,0.891,1.5389,4.4739,5.0085,0.1357,4.0786,1.5879,5.0728,1.4018,0.2802,0.0003,7.399,5.0048,0.1419,2.8793,4.9504,0.7241,1.3146,4.8001,0.6244,0.213,0.0014,2.4213,3.3537,1.7503,0.0295,1.5448,4.7372,0.0922,1.1038,3.3696,1.4572,1.2913,2.8848,3.3838,2.1963,5.1152,1.0555,0.6141,0.6698,1.4945,4.0633,0.7809,0.8585,3.1673,0.8774,5.6955,4.8755,2.1523,7.1256,1.9349,1.2404,1.5278,0.8619,5.5815,3.552,0.827,0.4065,0.6589,0.0002,1.3353,2.8577,2.8727,0.3701,4.0455,0.9004,4.7505,3.6199,0.943,1.233,1.1748,0.0612,0.1702,2.3165,5.171,3.1833,3.7731,8.5683,1.9249,6.4555,2.2503,6.8585,5.3838,3.7367,5.5153,0.2545,3.95,3.0546,5.2297,0.8024,1.3966,3.3941,5.7831,0.0231,1.322,5.4122,0.0641,0.1766,1.4855,2.9801,5.8644,1.0419,1.5386,0.0697,1.208,4.6613,4.3464,3.6754,3.4573,3.2615,0.5123,0.4319,3.9611,0.85,0.9078,0.2195,0.0002,1.4208,4.5211,2.5684,2.044,0.0021,1.7617,5.1441,3.5106,5.5687,1.8343,1.791,2.0354,1.8465,1.9191,0.0958,5.884,1.9279,5.4166,3.1388,2.8317,0.4342,2.9206,1.7272,5.0656,2.7357,5.3959,1.5556,2.8417,0.7216,6.054,1.9464,2.6737,4.2541,0.0277,4.5706,4.8144,3.9826,1.1704,3.7944,0.1287,5.1678,1.9791,0.5442,1.3086,0.3102,0.0002,1.3995,5.1149,2.3101,1.14,3.8645,0.5956,2.6487,2.0173,3.5427,0.2391,1.1649,0.0035,0.6883,5.1425,0.8636,2.652,1.0002,3.1892,0.1184,5.3326,3.8487,4.355,4.3142,1.6903,2.5459,3.1986,3.1451,3.8347,1.8817]}
{"id":3511,"ended":false,"length":508,"text":"A super spy discovers that the person he was sent to take down is himself... [Katherine Sheff\/CBS via AP]\nIn a story released by the Associated Press, the Washington, D.C. police chief of the time captured, the identity of an alleged \"war criminal\" \u2013 a man who had committed the crime.\nAn anonymous Washington Post report notes that the alleged \"war criminal\" was killed around 6:30 a.m. (7:30 a.m. UK time) Friday. That means that the person whom the AP claimed he was sent to kill is actually alive.\nThe identity of the alleged \"war criminal\" remains unknown. His name is not being released.\n\"This is part of a plan to get revenge on U.S. officials who were part of the Washington National Guard that provided protection to people captured in the 'war criminal' war in Afghanistan or Iraq,\" a U.S. official told the Post.\nAccording to the Post, \"U.S. intelligence agents had been secretly using informants for years to use secret intelligence and surveillance to cover the crime and obtain information.\"\nAs part of the war-faring secret service, the CIA, which was deployed in Afghanistan in 2007, was tasked with keeping Americans out of Afghanistan.\nFor the Obama administration, the use of secret informants was deeply disturbing. In 2001, the Bush administration was known for being secretive about its involvement in anti-terrorism operations. But CIA officials said those covert efforts had yielded huge successes that could change the lives of a generation.\nU.S. intelligence officials in early 2006 said they were unaware of \"any\" secret U.S. intelligence operations in Afghanistan either after 2002 or in 2001, following the invasion.\nSince the end of the war in Afghanistan in 2011, the Obama administration has repeatedly refused to acknowledge that the U.S. troops had left Afghanistan for the United States.\nThat administration has repeatedly said that they did not conduct covert operations to combat the threat posed by Islamic State militants.\nDuring President Barack Obama's first week as president, the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan was taken over by the local government. However, the embassy was closed in 2010, and the government of the northern country remained open.\nAt least 1,600 U.S.-Afghan border guards, including those stationed in Washington, D.C. or other American-led areas, remain in Afghanistan.\nAccording to the Washington Post report, the intelligence gathering and infiltration operations allegedly carried out by the CIA for months were believed to have cost the U.S. $26 billion (about $3.5 billion) per year over 20 years.\n\"This is a crime,\" DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said Thursday evening. \"There's no way I would go to those lengths. Those people are now dead or dead.\"","token_len":580,"entropy":[8.8132,7.5935,8.7086,1.2609,1.6697,5.7834,2.3311,2.6045,4.8551,0.1915,5.9478,1.7261,1.6794,5.4622,4.4827,5.1711,5.9803,4.8857,7.565,7.5452,5.1988,4.5565,4.4123,1.3938,0.0811,0.7787,16.0988,2.0278,4.7719,4.6075,2.4282,1.2263,3.0413,0.0007,1.2061,1.82,3.9994,5.0133,0.0568,0.0005,0.0013,3.1111,2.1092,2.9705,5.0365,1.22,3.4055,9.905,5.4473,4.1478,6.6038,0.0452,3.4829,2.7515,3.0916,6.1031,1.7473,0.1296,7.074,1.9778,2.005,1.0554,3.3501,5.6964,3.0157,2.5783,3.933,0.5487,10.7186,3.3729,4.1109,0.91,2.5839,5.0894,0.4078,1.2797,3.2932,1.5638,0.685,0.1041,0.133,1.4851,6.3836,6.4763,3.4086,0.8495,1.1087,1.0386,0.0003,0.0004,0.1127,5.6444,3.3146,0.3064,0.0166,0.8103,0.0006,0.0006,0.1075,7.747,0.0936,0.7706,5.2924,2.0885,4.6761,3.4846,1.3726,1.2447,3.6595,6.1407,0.9659,2.4892,5.076,4.2042,1.1902,2.0331,0.149,0.5768,2.0513,1.9071,5.2117,0.9179,0.3645,1.4304,5.5862,0.0962,0.2863,0.7629,0.551,0.0704,0.0272,0.0601,3.4021,1.2706,0.9373,5.3094,1.4939,1.2068,1.7279,1.4003,0.4619,1.4746,0.4817,3.0901,2.7638,0.8304,5.9343,0.0155,0.8314,6.5139,0.8795,3.5506,2.9456,0.7702,5.1769,0.0276,0.0029,0.0394,1.8999,1.0659,3.2128,5.5429,0.008,0.8266,6.2371,6.1868,2.5195,3.0485,5.7685,4.3435,1.014,4.6906,5.3978,1.6215,1.1249,4.0925,2.6636,5.9526,0.5476,5.0201,2.7491,1.5344,5.2832,0.5781,0.4915,3.3963,3.6171,0.0002,0.0044,0.0017,0.7047,0.5431,0.9705,3.1366,0.2802,0.5109,4.0582,0.0024,0.6553,2.0856,0.2105,2.7209,3.8784,0.001,0.0019,0.0037,3.2148,4.6584,3.3699,1.5853,5.4468,5.4706,3.7137,3.4116,1.0855,0.5354,5.7107,6.3309,3.5637,3.9966,2.5132,2.0078,5.0448,3.8025,6.4878,3.2754,4.8414,1.3826,2.9792,0.2095,4.6457,3.154,0.0014,0.7489,4.8583,3.8428,6.2696,3.5902,6.4361,2.8622,0.5977,0.8058,2.9688,2.6132,3.4327,1.9708,5.0913,1.3259,0.7406,1.3608,3.795,0.5705,1.7205,3.1571,0.0727,3.6977,3.7583,3.7488,0.0975,3.3302,1.2519,1.0178,5.7576,1.9086,5.5218,0.0685,0.2652,0.8273,5.0361,0.0042,2.8854,2.9105,1.5944,7.4333,2.5026,0.7144,2.6614,4.9308,0.0832,1.1076,3.3872,0.1026,3.3592,4.8128,1.0591,4.4081,3.0665,0.3586,1.1294,2.3219,0.2923,5.7234,0.0173,1.6834,0.7789,0.7156,2.8521,5.8343,2.4109,2.7168,5.2993,4.4022,2.7341,2.2413,4.9288,5.3838,2.778,3.6554,3.5739,4.9416,0.5684,4.7265,0.0141,5.5539,2.714,1.198,0.2943,4.5302,0.0013,0.0035,0.0029,1.3778,0.9114,4.4476,5.4148,2.8868,2.3613,1.2104,1.6474,4.412,0.2902,4.5035,2.3641,4.8744,4.1294,3.4496,0.0012,0.0022,0.0325,1.8578,1.6279,1.6603,0.5571,7.0422,4.9047,3.9795,0.1901,3.2559,3.8937,1.9492,5.7559,0.7185,4.1614,2.3828,0.7049,4.7853,2.2701,3.3522,0.0011,0.2679,0.9757,0.8967,1.4855,1.3441,3.1585,0.0588,1.1543,2.4967,0.0352,0.2112,4.2777,4.0623,0.02,2.704,1.1184,1.5119,1.7408,0.0004,0.001,0.0436,6.1051,2.4746,5.0467,2.8882,3.1054,2.0016,3.8776,0.3201,0.7432,0.9532,4.7819,5.4672,1.271,2.5396,3.073,0.8175,3.2611,1.9923,0.1648,5.7227,2.5132,0.3442,3.4454,4.3172,1.3909,2.8429,1.1907,0.0487,2.5618,0.6269,1.9027,0.8742,0.8799,4.7965,4.2578,1.2167,0.003,0.0022,1.0426,4.6631,3.3718,0.2214,0.1494,1.3783,2.2064,0.0005,0.0032,0.004,4.2676,0.1357,3.3713,1.411,6.0979,0.3757,0.1223,1.1316,5.2077,2.2845,1.6213,4.3066,0.0095,1.3663,2.7091,1.3593,3.6177,2.1891,3.9296,1.7772,1.3657,1.178,3.1034,2.8354,1.5527,5.3815,5.032,4.0531,3.6777,1.1061,0.5605,5.0017,2.1847,4.7403,0.0222,3.5326,0.7438,0.0005,0.0015,8.6976,4.7886,0.0018,4.4556,0.6206,2.8115,2.3448,2.7944,1.7092,0.8714,5.0692,0.5115,0.7257,0.0004,0.0019,3.4277,6.0927,2.5454,3.1308,1.4434,2.5253,5.0579,0.4192,3.2424,1.151,1.0623,0.9221,0.9158,3.4047,0.0026,0.953,2.3781,0.0722,3.6232,0.1141,1.1685,5.7431,4.2281,2.64,5.4555,4.1817,6.4823,1.2646,0.0091,0.1841,0.6204,2.4671,6.2517,4.3611,2.6798,5.9679,0.0626,0.5992,4.5274,1.217,0.6832,0.0005,0.001,0.0242,2.1229,5.7006,1.1262,5.0312,1.7947,0.0816,3.9965,0.8543,1.6845,0.0418,1.1455,4.3743,0.1576,4.732,4.9784,0.0191,0.3026,0.4338,3.0912,2.718,1.1325,1.4227,5.4452,3.552,8.2316,4.5866,0.2877,0.0167,0.5388,1.0013,4.0077,4.9066,1.1392,0.5165,3.806,1.5883,0.9302,2.5811,3.0923,1.9702,3.9746,1.9578,6.0402,2.9696,2.333,6.2683,1.983,1.455,5.8536,2.0227,5.3897,2.7069,1.0339]}

{"id":4968,"ended":true,"length":500,"text":"A city that vanished without a trace 10,000 years ago has just recently reappeared.\n\nThe town of Laguerre Island, in the French Caribbean territory of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, is now undergoing an experimental study that hopes to identify the earliest remnants of the island. A study being led by French architect Jules Mierp\u00e8re and his colleagues, has detected a significant presence of the tiny island around the edge of the ocean floor. The island has suffered extreme environmental and social changes in the last 3,000 years, including the development of large-scale urbanization. To explain this trend, the island was built from water and seawater, but recently a new kind of construction is being applied to its water-sink and seawater storage facilities.\n\nBased on a recent expedition to the site, we also know that there are many distinct cultures that the island had previously existed in that were still involved in its development, ranging from the French-speaking natives of the island to the local non-French inhabitants. As scientists, it is very clear that the ancient community and cultural traditions that the island was rich in, particularly in its food and culture, were one of the key drivers that developed the island.\n\nBased on more than 300 archaeological specimens, it is clear that the island\u2019s cultural legacy was a major factor in its development. In fact, the island served as \u201cheritage\u201d site for Native Americans of the island, who lived on the island for thousands of years. It also housed both European and African migrants.\n\nMierp\u00e8re and his colleagues hope that by the end of the study, they will be able to identify the earliest traces of these people. The results of this study will be presented at the end of a major science conference in the spring of 2018. This event will address the question: what can be found of \u201cthe island?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis study provides a detailed explanation of the island and its cultural identity. It shows how the island\u2019s original culture had changed through time as it was incorporated into a new generation of Africans,\u201d says Jean-Marc Mierp\u00e8re. The results of this study offer \u201cimportant hope for the future\u201d of the island.\n\n\u201cThe island has changed radically, and despite the recent changes and the long journey which has occurred, it was indeed a new society for everyone, especially for Africans,\u201d says Martin Poulin, Director-General of Environment of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. In the next few years we hope that the study will reveal the island\u2019s full history, as well as the future of civilization.\n\nMartin Poulin, Director-General of Environment of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...","token_len":585,"entropy":[8.2707,2.9417,11.0022,3.2988,0.1635,0.0435,7.0896,2.8378,0.1747,0.0514,0.0322,2.9418,5.3758,4.9631,5.3146,0.0022,1.7554,0.8383,0.0004,1.7204,4.1382,0.5112,4.8771,6.6719,3.2257,0.0633,8.4123,0.9567,2.5063,1.3355,2.6982,3.9824,6.1249,0.2026,4.9221,0.2267,0.0022,0.0756,18.6521,10.3897,9.7358,0.5451,0.0029,0.0733,1.3239,2.4887,5.3175,2.1867,7.1957,2.6417,2.4693,4.009,0.0699,3.9847,1.2439,3.1775,5.169,0.0219,1.471,1.9095,1.9978,4.4308,4.1196,6.1676,2.3884,0.037,3.7494,6.3819,5.0332,2.4569,4.5076,5.1274,5.5708,5.2185,2.1001,1.7361,2.1234,2.2615,4.2698,6.0478,2.2647,4.0673,4.0588,0.0587,2.9895,5.5526,1.7802,4.6486,1.9867,6.3481,0.0074,0.7721,4.2683,4.1651,1.0505,2.5351,3.3297,2.3981,6.555,5.4482,4.9443,3.4131,2.3912,1.3394,2.5973,0.9617,1.3054,4.5156,0.1195,0.3077,0.0099,0.8,2.4668,1.5881,4.1676,0.0462,3.4576,2.5671,0.0072,5.5148,2.3033,1.4244,6.4022,5.3051,1.0948,5.5666,0.1451,1.0946,4.6042,2.8049,3.1613,3.2699,5.9185,2.3852,6.2513,0.0356,1.4219,2.9484,6.0858,4.1292,1.7028,4.314,0.0047,5.9471,3.0586,1.3465,4.3929,0.7384,3.5399,3.7683,3.7821,4.2367,3.5548,3.5083,3.7319,0.3638,4.7968,2.7792,0.3139,0.4573,0.0003,6.7938,0.0472,2.7723,3.5969,4.0173,1.5782,0.856,2.7018,0.3954,6.0819,5.4983,3.3267,0.3441,3.0999,1.2696,3.641,5.3912,5.5124,2.4906,7.2753,1.268,4.0174,3.6698,3.9364,1.4954,5.0517,5.5056,4.1602,5.4315,0.312,3.3309,2.2135,2.1638,5.4753,0.0644,1.3532,4.9528,4.7366,0.0811,5.1883,0.9476,0.754,1.26,0.5431,0.5926,4.6561,5.6552,0.0362,1.0336,2.3328,0.7814,4.1194,6.6109,2.3257,3.7579,0.5323,3.8183,5.1552,0.1472,1.0243,4.5546,4.4627,4.1736,4.4888,3.422,1.6918,3.3981,1.1988,2.3818,6.6742,0.0922,2.3935,5.9517,1.738,1.8297,3.3036,0.8732,3.2557,0.1848,1.959,5.827,0.463,0.2081,2.6457,3.3335,2.5622,4.9494,1.0705,1.0089,1.7783,0.9149,0.0002,6.0043,0.0319,6.5427,0.8651,3.8458,2.4264,4.813,1.1335,3.4971,0.7393,1.7583,0.1073,0.7971,1.8047,14.4126,0.4784,2.0806,3.4051,3.7926,2.0897,3.2792,2.3249,1.234,0.5808,1.11,1.8077,0.6214,2.9814,1.8893,0.0641,1.3837,1.8657,6.9997,0.0928,15.1039,4.9675,8.6601,2.508,2.7766,6.5159,5.6594,0.7573,8.805,0.5088,3.6362,0.6657,2.2654,1.672,1.6095,2.4617,2.6944,0.4761,0.9233,0.7129,2.166,0.0185,0.0058,0.7363,3.2024,2.0188,5.3709,6.0735,4.9526,0.4003,2.8611,4.9674,2.0361,1.3815,0.0002,5.2754,0.2105,0.0016,0.006,1.4206,0.1358,1.1386,4.4303,0.8648,3.6219,4.5118,1.5755,0.0016,0.4335,4.0306,0.7062,0.9941,0.4093,0.9529,0.0074,0.0032,1.7013,0.7528,0.9919,1.6449,0.0279,4.304,2.8649,1.5467,2.1552,4.2166,1.2319,1.3291,1.0548,1.0404,1.6489,2.546,0.5691,0.553,5.0903,0.0017,5.1409,3.8697,5.3937,0.5308,1.0297,2.738,3.6474,0.3576,1.6913,0.6291,4.5597,3.6875,0.8487,5.4802,0.7964,2.332,1.8945,2.613,4.1147,1.3164,4.1733,4.3522,6.6131,0.1541,0.9463,2.7696,3.7446,5.0543,5.9264,0.7146,0.0002,2.8264,1.0897,4.3097,2.2693,3.7361,1.3525,4.3166,4.4237,0.2663,0.5802,3.0492,3.3114,0.8813,2.4841,4.7434,1.0973,1.2231,3.2537,2.3906,1.2282,1.8042,5.6343,0.0826,0.0417,5.5107,2.9362,4.4907,3.1373,4.4034,2.0997,3.5601,1.4415,1.7586,4.3917,0.1529,2.7769,1.5006,6.3213,0.2509,5.6864,1.6762,10.985,3.4065,9.4613,4.1481,0.5577,3.0018,3.77,0.244,0.0147,0.0286,0.7243,1.7711,3.8765,0.9566,0.4287,0.5443,4.7677,7.9948,0.2441,7.1861,6.0401,1.004,1.1266,1.2156,2.5306,1.0037,1.6799,0.6006,0.7728,1.5944,0.5115,0.0002,1.4145,0.3538,1.4706,2.543,2.7523,4.5997,4.3668,3.9045,2.1638,6.3998,1.5679,3.9111,1.9423,3.7031,2.4545,5.08,4.3947,6.0665,1.6241,4.8409,1.3678,1.5603,4.6252,6.5159,1.3583,4.0239,4.4102,2.8637,5.1892,2.577,4.715,1.6878,2.768,2.1058,1.2288,1.1557,0.5573,6.8343,4.3475,3.2256,1.5983,0.4772,3.4598,3.2161,0.2801,0.1436,7.3097,4.0168,5.059,0.0343,0.0003,0.1122,0.0379,0.0133,0.0169,0.0022,0.0008,0.5818,3.6984,1.8881,4.4414,1.3435,0.3359,3.9341,1.5411,1.212,1.3422,2.9157,0.6667,2.8679,1.3641,4.6377,0.4969,0.034,0.0252,4.6097,3.3517,1.6035,3.7013,0.1661,0.012,1.2016,5.8359,0.8776,8.1878,1.5273,0.5638,0.0002,8.0813,0.1945,0.0202,0.0009,0.969,0.7336,0.0637,0.0102,0.3056,0.032,0.2685,0.0476,0.001,0.001,0.0069,0.0021,0.0013,0.0012,0.0051,0.0005,3.4034,0.9379,0.0002,6.9493,0.5528,0.2057,0.0002,0.0,0.0058]}
{"id":2789,"ended":false,"length":557,"text":"first contact between Humans and Aliens, writen from the perspective of the aliens, who are scholars.\n\nNext, the aliens walk on a field, in a landscape that they see, or the world they see, will say, a word that they know in English, with the meaning of their existence, the words of their being, for those of us who remember the beginning of our existence, the beginning of our universe, and everything that we do in the past.\n\nThis is one of my favourite works and I enjoy every part of it. I can imagine all kinds of things from the past and the future and from our present situation to that time, where we have not only a sense of humanity on the planet to this day but a sense of history as well and its history as well.\n\nWhat I like best about the world that they see is the use of images or words to convey the meaning that we will always have, both for our future and our past.\n\nThe words also represent the meanings we will always have with the words that we express, or that we have used for our present and future. They represent where we are in the present, as well as what we will always do in the future, regardless of whether we will use them or not.\n\nI would also like to say how important it is for the words to convey the meaning of those words being used when speaking to them. For this reason it is almost impossible to know whether they are meaning for us or not. But to understand the meaning that they represent for the words, we need the words.\n\nHow We Work\n\nThe processes that we undertake to do these things, such as making sure that we do not have any mistakes and mistakes that we made while we worked hard to live the life that we envisioned, we would also work with each other.\n\nWe would learn the ways that they would help us through these times, which would then explain to us how we would change.\n\nWe would talk to each other about whether we should get married, do anything in the next generation which may be more important than the next generation.\n\nThe process of learning through these times would be to go back in time and learn from our mistakes.\n\nThere would be an exercise of choosing either a happy marriage or an unhappy marriage at the start, and a trial of going back in time, which would show the difference between our experiences and any mistakes that had come before in a previous life.\n\nIn order to get to the

{"id":1033,"ended":true,"length":523,"text":"An old man's happiest memory comes back when he accidentally gets lost on the way home.' - Pashtuns\n\nShare via e-mail\n\nAn old man, who has said hello to his daughter while she has gone off to school, has been left in emotional troubles since he accidentally accidentally gets lost on the way home.\n\n\"She told me not to worry. I didn't realise she was upset, and she said everything would make sense,\" said the 47-year-old, who lives in south London. That means \"you can only put yourself in her shoes\".\n\nPashtuns were the victims of an accident in March and were driving in the city on the morning of the first anniversary of the accident in April 2013 when the car hit off an embankment. Pashtuns said \"the car was off the road and there were no people on the road\".\n\n\"I have a really deep emotional attachment to my daughter, and she has given me an incredible amount of advice with regards to her mental health, so that helped.\"\n\nWhen Pashtuns found his daughter and he realised the car was off the road, he took her where he believed Pashtuns was. \"She told me she was going home and I told her she would come down at 5am,\" says Pashtuns.\n\n\"I remember driving right to the exit so I got on my vehicle, but I didn't realise I had to go round the bend at the exit to get that last-minute turn into a lane. There didn't need to be a turn,\" says Pashtuns, who has three young children.\n\nThe young children have had some of their school school work delayed so many years to this day. But they have been encouraged to work hard and can look forward.\n\n\"There's always times I give her my time, but the best thing is now she'll know how excited I am,\" says Pashtuns.\n\nPashtuns is a successful musician in the music industry which has led to three tours with two solo albums.\n\n\"I've always been a fan of jazz music and so it was great to be able to come here and get an honest review of what it's all about with an opinion that didn't have to be a part of the song itself,\" adds Pashtuns.\n\nPashtuns and his wife, who loves to travel, will also continue making music and enjoy concerts. The couple have decided to put on a show here in the UK together, which they plan to see whenever possible.\n\n\"We're making music together because it's our passion,\" says Pashtuns. He said it's not a hobby for the couple as they have no idea what it's going to mean when he's in this world of travel.","token_len":586,"entropy":[7.4366,2.4361,3.663,11.8637,2.8103,4.4638,2.6407,4.8892,0.4841,6.9855,4.3867,4.2208,2.805,1.1327,2.4318,1.0354,9.9728,2.8235,6.2476,7.0482,3.9441,4.3713,2.2586,0.0059,7.8993,7.2884,6.067,0.4117,0.092,2.647,0.0003,5.4694,0.3698,0.0457,7.1397,1.3609,2.7938,6.3873,8.9701,0.4271,1.7125,3.7738,4.2304,1.7606,4.4752,2.9368,3.8914,0.5572,0.9967,0.4272,1.7451,2.0461,3.2255,2.5847,6.5907,11.725,5.6731,1.4349,3.0708,6.4026,2.092,0.06,0.3981,0.19,0.025,0.0211,0.3372,0.1412,0.0002,5.7835,2.7864,3.8232,0.2251,4.8858,0.0183,0.9881,2.7378,1.3097,3.4259,0.0004,5.1758,1.6656,0.3885,4.6962,2.3861,2.762,1.9418,2.3443,6.1844,2.5703,6.8618,0.3768,1.2009,1.3754,1.5324,4.9479,0.0169,0.0018,0.0027,0.0004,2.2944,0.2646,2.3933,0.3836,5.7792,1.1169,0.3598,10.8288,6.1485,6.5189,3.8572,2.0712,4.9905,5.9323,3.0507,0.6445,3.0533,0.4182,2.9467,0.0907,0.0003,4.7157,0.2288,0.0602,0.0051,8.0098,4.8561,5.652,0.0453,1.9229,1.2723,1.849,3.9383,4.2965,1.9389,4.6352,3.4713,1.348,2.8035,2.7431,2.2638,4.3506,0.184,1.8267,5.3358,3.4571,0.2406,0.3021,1.9504,3.3953,3.1567,3.5636,1.9568,2.1217,1.6583,3.2994,7.6148,3.6577,2.0569,0.0001,0.0112,1.3921,4.875,0.0442,0.0057,0.0041,1.732,5.9651,2.7906,1.8253,1.5589,5.7036,1.0177,0.2719,1.6143,2.8742,1.6761,1.3345,2.2839,1.601,0.7323,0.3025,1.5884,0.3262,0.0003,1.971,1.2466,4.3564,2.8422,4.9375,4.7147,2.771,1.4012,0.1326,1.463,0.1338,1.515,0.8719,1.8042,2.6086,4.6415,0.1857,3.2038,2.5999,1.3918,0.0595,3.5089,6.1789,2.5107,0.015,2.6788,4.9753,0.4161,2.2331,3.2559,3.4125,5.8599,4.0682,0.1332,0.0003,4.3719,1.8599,0.005,0.0019,0.0033,3.7032,3.1534,0.4754,4.0867,5.0774,3.689,2.6871,1.0013,0.5714,1.9535,0.3367,0.0144,0.9513,0.2015,3.7722,0.5228,8.1325,1.0465,5.765,8.8273,0.0079,0.0102,0.0037,1.2556,1.529,2.5026,1.7215,2.0535,0.0691,3.3451,1.2111,3.4605,2.9534,1.3454,1.5144,2.288,0.0489,2.429,2.6405,3.3807,5.5773,3.2965,3.1451,1.5308,2.0485,5.4183,0.7879,0.0112,0.0022,0.0046,0.3656,0.382,0.0002,1.1056,1.1754,4.648,4.4535,5.7406,2.8677,1.1097,4.7446,4.5277,0.9045,4.0627,2.7668,1.9607,5.6679,2.1546,2.7852,1.6967,2.1984,0.0007,2.3499,2.3977,1.7938,3.1089,2.2494,5.4406,0.957,3.9981,3.8997,0.9318,4.6046,2.2316,0.6482,5.5765,4.4721,5.8628,0.1083,2.5551,5.2627,2.5906,3.7982,1.3111,4.916,6.7246,0.0005,4.8092,0.0106,0.0178,0.9602,1.7808,3.5398,1.6758,0.1824,0.0128,0.0019,0.0043,2.0999,0.3906,1.9483,3.9644,2.1649,0.3339,0.7894,0.3527,0.0002,2.4663,3.9308,2.8189,2.8899,3.808,4.2616,3.0012,1.2163,3.5613,5.7641,4.3081,4.1562,3.0398,5.997,3.9986,4.8943,5.8649,0.1415,1.2957,3.618,2.0656,1.9016,1.8064,4.1996,0.4875,3.9608,2.015,1.0057,5.4165,5.3192,1.6467,7.0759,0.5099,0.0002,0.9874,3.6194,1.641,2.6862,7.5899,3.6185,6.4359,2.6011,3.2252,4.3904,1.4803,1.2694,3.9601,4.1948,1.5524,1.1569,5.9304,0.651,3.6438,2.8644,2.4521,6.549,0.7199,0.0941,1.7411,0.4011,0.2917,0.0119,0.0019,0.0038,0.2802,0.363,0.0002,2.1209,0.1233,0.0023,0.0032,2.6418,3.0765,5.3105,3.6267,4.0943,1.5627,2.3139,0.6696,5.5154,1.1562,3.7371,0.4774,5.4313,5.661,2.4368,5.2483,5.5444,1.0598,1.4557,1.3878,0.0002,2.0997,1.1262,1.9108,2.0741,1.2244,1.5216,2.9899,0.1202,5.4156,1.9721,1.2747,4.7608,2.369,1.5756,2.5906,0.4815,1.7747,1.0294,0.0059,3.5427,3.4867,0.7841,3.6026,3.8699,5.3982,4.2512,0.6695,2.0592,3.1223,1.0163,1.9181,0.003,4.5393,3.6665,5.4902,3.1649,5.5979,0.0003,3.0515,2.0845,0.7099,4.0851,4.4824,0.005,1.4109,5.1321,3.7854,0.473,4.179,0.2899,0.0072,0.0016,0.0038,0.0912,0.3529,0.0002,2.4248,0.1248,0.0025,0.0038,4.0782,0.3833,0.9665,1.5409,2.5176,7.0682,1.7632,3.1594,0.5811,4.0542,3.9243,5.138,5.2272,0.75,2.1802,6.4394,6.5553,1.2749,3.9581,0.8336,1.4263,5.9914,0.1556,3.9557,1.6557,0.5689,1.9121,4.9821,1.9318,1.8046,3.8923,7.2548,2.7317,2.3044,2.1578,2.7684,0.1354,5.6266,7.906,1.9705,0.1452,0.5767,0.0002,1.8779,1.4739,1.4555,4.5155,1.4029,1.3106,2.6021,2.3058,0.3337,3.127,2.5245,1.7077,0.2417,0.2582,0.0107,0.0015,0.0063,0.1624,5.1221,2.6364,3.3921,1.6982,2.8203,2.4238,4.4162,2.8269,2.49,1.5815,3.654,0.9392,2.2412,2.2713,3.2993,0.8678,1.5977,0.7478,3.1079,0.0053,4.1193,3.3683,3.8987,2.3981,3.1176,5.1708,2.6902,3.9618,5.2533,0.4913]}

{"id":732,"ended":true,"length":560,"text":"You wake up in world full of cardboard people. These are cut-outs of your family, friends and general people. The world are populated with yourself and them. You have not any friends or relatives. Your parents never give a crap about you. They just leave you alone. It will always be a lonely time for you. You have to sleep in your rooms and sleep your soul out. You can be an alcoholic. We are so close. You must be aware of yourself. If you stay away, nothing, you are not alone. It is always your fault. That is why I call you. Come and see me. You will never be alone.\n\nSo the way you tell yourself. If you want to go back in time and get a new world as you have never been, try this : try to live as if you are a real person. Try to think about a new culture. Try to have a more realistic look at yourself. Try to stop being silly. Try to do something you have not done before. Try to think about things you need to do today. Try to sleep well with your mind. Try to eat a good meal only if you want to and work for a real job. Try to exercise regularly.\n\nSo what should you do? Try to forget the past\n\nDon't forget what I said last. You are not alone. It is your destiny to take your time and learn to do things well. It's time for you to do what your dad did when he was working for IBM for many of the other companies. You have to spend time in your home, at your church Sunday School, a weekly Bible study, or at the movies. You are the reason why the world is changing and what you want.\n\nI hope you have had some time to think this through. So many years to live, to make a difference. If you think about what can change, what can help you to achieve anything. I hope you have time to see the world around you now.\n\nI hope you are feeling satisfied. I hope you have time to be happy and get something done. You can do everything. I know this will be hard. But at the end of the day you are free and you are doing the right job. Don't focus on losing yourself. Don't look for your friends. Don't forget your family. Don't forget all you ever have in your life.\n\nAll the best.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nDr. Michael E.

I don't think he would choose that, and I don't think he wants to continue.\n\nI also think if he ends up at some point, it will be hard to find the end product from all his past attempts to get what he wanted. I like the idea that there is some sort of redemption from what he did to people who were killed, and I hope that things are better for the world. He certainly is a good guy and even if he ends up in the same situation one day as they were in, it will make it worse.

If it didn't sound like this at first you wouldn't know him but this performance will bring him to your attention and it's just this special show for you. I love this thing.\"\n\"It was a little bit of both for me,\" Bass said of the performance. \"I've been waiting to get back to 'A New Hope' since the last time we'd seen each other on television, but it was too soon. We've been working hard to get the show ready and I love all the work he's put into it. When I see 'A New Hope,' I'll be ecstatic. Not to be too dramatic now, but I'll be excited. He's a truly great singer.\"\nThe event is scheduled to take place from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Saturday, March 15 during the show at Paramount Theater through Sunday, March 19th at 7:30 p.m. and March 21st at 6 p.m. on Feb. 1, with performances on March 28 and 6, 7, 8, 8 and 11.

{"id":1801,"ended":true,"length":554,"text":"An elderly man is on a mission to right the wrongs he made... not by running away from punishment but by seeking justice for those involved...\n\nA retired senior citizen, 66, is now seeking an end to decades of injustice.\n\nA former law professor, John A. Smith, now of the University of Delaware, plans to donate the $6,000 to the Delaware Court of Appeals, the state body set up to make the process easier for people to get help.\n\nSmith said he wanted to make sure that as the old man ages, he has a legal foundation built.\n\n\"I've also talked about the state of Delaware as a state as to why people really feel like you can move out of your houses \u2014 you won't need to live a hundred years out of town,\" Smith said, describing his plan. \"I hope the judges understand that in most areas, you're going to have community centers \u2014 you don't need to own a home to do that, where your community is where you spend your days and nights.\"\n\nSmith and his wife, Debra, plan to help their mother-in-law and her husband in their fight against the justice system.\n\n\"I've written letters (to the governor),\" Debra Smith said. \"They've actually told me, 'You know, you've been through hell and you've come up with this.'\"\n\nDebra Smith of Wilmington said she would prefer that those served by the Delaware Court of Appeals or the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas give the man a chance to speak publicly.\n\n\"If you talk to him in a normal conversation, you won't hear any of it,\" Debra Smith said. \"He is the most innocent person.\"\n\nSmith's plan comes just about three months after the Delaware Supreme Court made the courts decision of overturning a 2009 ruling that found it unconstitutional to have a juvenile offender serve up to five prison terms if his behavior is a misdemeanor.\n\nThe verdict meant 10 months of probation. In October 2007, three of the nine judges decided that juvenile offenders were not eligible to serve the two-year prison term in Delaware.\n\nThose sentences typically last four years, and the judges had made it clear they would not be able to find any other evidence to convict that defendant.\n\nIn 2007, the ruling came down and prosecutors were awarded a victory that had stunned the world.\n\n\"The sentence sentence has been reversed,\" Michael Mascaro, president of Maryland's Supreme Court, said. \"A jury of the Delaware justices that's made the case for this decision, let me say, should have received a similar treatment back in 2007.\"\n\nIn response to the ruling, lawyers are hoping there will be a second one \u2014 the final one \u2014 due in 2012. They've also asked a federal judge to hold off serving his sentences until they are served.","token_len":591,"entropy":[10.1206,1.5595,3.226,4.9268,2.0722,3.9666,0.325,9.4798,1.4677,0.4887,0.5883,5.2803,4.1715,7.2568,7.1932,3.522,5.5606,1.2072,1.1478,8.4804,0.9762,0.182,5.5893,2.3261,1.9426,2.0939,5.1493,3.6231,1.9387,0.057,3.2945,5.0139,5.5987,5.2912,3.018,7.5783,0.2464,1.5228,4.8026,3.6943,3.2682,4.6322,0.0014,4.2558,0.1236,3.1235,2.1135,1.1672,0.0003,3.3813,2.5663,5.8528,3.1778,1.1598,4.8753,5.0187,0.8685,4.6306,0.6434,5.1622,5.8748,1.8998,0.7571,0.0269,4.6533,0.3613,6.1599,0.0898,5.495,3.2769,2.0343,4.4001,0.5441,0.4871,1.8839,1.5162,6.1501,7.4121,0.0848,0.659,2.3035,2.9527,1.7366,5.8121,4.7505,0.1557,0.3862,4.4618,2.5148,4.2676,3.3787,0.369,2.5741,2.3435,2.4858,1.7563,0.8087,0.1188,0.0003,1.8537,1.6954,0.7078,4.1192,0.5026,2.7601,1.0037,1.7506,5.3953,3.595,6.5402,2.153,7.8887,0.7158,1.4459,2.9662,1.4672,3.4991,6.2481,3.928,3.3443,0.3718,0.0002,0.671,1.2665,3.2332,5.8805,4.4826,2.6709,2.4007,5.1881,1.5952,1.1138,2.4353,0.8662,3.4072,5.8705,4.5814,2.9177,2.9115,6.8374,4.0862,2.3016,4.9663,1.7292,6.406,3.7486,0.5213,2.6344,7.3094,7.5777,2.589,5.4836,0.0023,4.4119,0.792,3.6855,5.3734,4.303,1.8434,4.6003,0.6515,5.8926,0.9754,0.7537,0.122,3.6069,4.4347,1.8621,3.4395,0.8311,1.2181,1.4627,3.4725,3.4752,4.6101,4.4532,0.7214,4.5084,4.8105,5.3138,1.255,2.0048,2.2981,2.0827,0.0287,1.2851,7.2785,4.6644,4.7179,1.5826,2.412,0.0002,0.8328,0.5842,4.9236,0.4705,1.764,2.2476,3.4007,1.0592,2.6252,6.4249,3.527,3.5143,1.6136,4.9934,0.3251,6.3268,0.8217,3.2935,2.5859,1.7703,0.8319,0.0765,0.0002,2.231,4.1979,0.8307,0.6696,0.6687,5.7592,0.3024,0.4181,4.078,0.0677,4.2466,4.0544,5.1689,3.9108,0.0113,0.0015,0.0023,2.4547,2.0559,2.2533,3.8859,1.2682,3.6581,1.6408,1.7407,6.2007,0.0702,0.5029,0.4646,0.0002,1.1934,1.5181,2.6427,5.3602,2.4749,6.4156,0.6472,1.0857,4.0261,6.5965,5.2214,0.0745,0.4205,0.1725,0.4463,0.0652,2.8508,1.6288,5.7909,3.4925,0.336,2.2829,0.326,1.9359,2.1419,0.9934,1.8944,2.7324,2.4181,3.5434,2.3298,1.9806,3.479,1.2246,4.2953,3.2522,0.3953,2.8634,4.0474,0.0923,0.0002,4.5394,0.0283,0.3077,6.6014,2.76,2.382,0.6402,4.2533,5.1248,1.782,5.1881,7.7326,1.6646,0.6888,2.4905,1.4126,0.0349,0.0191,5.6561,0.7135,2.157,3.5758,2.2371,0.0474,3.0762,0.0053,0.0009,4.712,2.7593,4.4089,1.6579,1.0035,0.2357,4.5446,5.0753,1.1411,0.2304,0.0002,0.5702,2.9323,2.0362,5.8142,0.4243,1.7053,3.5318,2.4622,4.8644,2.4579,0.4794,1.6521,3.8853,0.0009,1.5578,3.3016,1.7779,3.0513,0.6217,1.5571,0.0024,0.0218,0.0187,0.1211,0.2273,1.778,4.0396,3.7245,3.3897,4.6838,0.599,4.2523,0.1587,0.0002,2.5601,3.1819,1.6797,3.3509,2.9411,6.3895,2.7506,0.8802,0.0789,1.6682,4.319,1.9216,0.0124,5.476,2.6684,9.5474,4.9565,6.0086,4.2132,0.0005,0.9669,4.3337,1.2924,1.1152,3.1134,4.4932,1.179,0.3191,4.0903,1.4215,5.1285,3.9467,2.2157,4.5878,0.5554,2.6557,7.4743,0.284,3.8307,3.1413,4.9736,2.0484,3.72,5.6018,0.2106,0.3493,0.0002,1.3386,6.1085,6.3174,7.6619,3.9826,1.003,1.5309,2.99,3.6689,4.7939,4.899,0.0543,5.1858,2.7075,0.44,2.7443,1.7224,5.2458,1.6174,2.9339,0.6116,1.9797,1.8305,2.1266,1.3876,0.6308,2.4647,5.7794,0.6138,0.2292,2.3833,0.6559,3.8128,1.7662,0.7324,0.5291,0.0002,4.9774,2.6834,7.4184,3.5485,3.2112,0.8699,1.4041,2.3746,2.0348,3.2621,3.5665,4.5958,1.7882,0.23,1.9624,1.0872,1.2115,3.4732,2.3887,0.0085,4.9523,3.088,2.8794,6.2443,1.4813,3.5806,5.4148,3.1352,0.5586,0.2906,0.0002,2.278,3.7972,0.0567,0.9332,6.1751,3.1736,1.5127,2.7889,5.7114,3.04,4.7613,1.9322,6.2396,3.1851,4.0834,5.5939,0.6596,5.3373,0.4973,0.615,0.0002,2.1658,2.058,5.0024,6.0888,3.9427,0.5109,3.1653,1.4196,7.5253,4.5305,5.5333,2.4883,0.1923,4.2133,0.1396,6.2881,0.8497,4.7851,0.0712,0.3562,0.4813,1.8029,0.3546,4.5978,3.6704,2.7148,2.3728,3.5342,5.6167,5.7877,6.0282,4.8029,1.8816,3.6405,1.3713,2.3003,2.7081,2.5856,5.9746,2.3676,1.9052,0.6575,5.9953,1.2828,6.2586,1.4906,5.3474,6.926,5.977,0.5262,1.86,0.6405,0.0738,0.0002,2.5641,4.3103,0.7815,0.6562,1.2415,0.1338,5.3774,7.6109,3.5122,5.935,0.3189,0.0879,1.1907,3.5171,4.6882,4.7008,3.1732,4.4612,0.5925,1.4747,6.0871,1.1771,4.2777,0.2942,4.5171,4.2269,2.3467,2.7993,4.2683,2.019,0.3249,0.3821,5.3862,3.6679,7.6659,3.8643,3.2375,1.2475,3.4551,1.2986,3.7153,1.3275]}

{"id":1773,"ended":false,"length":503,"text":"A priest visits a house to exorcise a little girl. Expecting the usual head-spinning and projectile-vomiting, he is surprised when he finds the demon listening to Tchaikovsky and enjoying some exotic French cheese.\n\nThe priest is struck by the beauty of what he has discovered. Then Tchaikovsky sings about his own, beautiful masterpiece. Here is an ode-like, if perhaps monotonous, piano note, a song which has grown on him over the course of his career:\n\n\u201cIn a little one, I was looking everywhere at this thing. It came into my little eyes, because by that time every one of you was looking everywhere else, but I didn\u2019t see it. To the left of it, that was there, and there it was, but to the right, as to the left, it was all in his little eyes, but to the right, all in his whole mouth. And the right, that was there. I don\u2019t know if you understand but in this whole little world where that thing was, all in his whole mouth, I don\u2019t see it, where he was all alone, I know that for only a little, all and to the right, where it was all, I don\u2019t see it; I don\u2019t see it anywhere.\u201d\n\nAs the chorus of the song rises, Tchaikovsky sings at last, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing more than the great old soul singing to himself, \u2018\u2018\n\nWhat is also striking is the similarity in tone between the priest and his sister. According to Tchaikovsky, who writes in Tchaikovsky\u2019s writings in the 17th and 18th century, the daughter was the singer of God. Thus, \u201cIt struck me that this was a child with some kind of love.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the chorus, Tchaikovsky sings again:\n\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s nothing more then the great old soul singing to himself, \u2018\u2018\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing more than the great old soul singing to himself,\n\nI love you, little one,\n\nAnd what are the things I could love you,\n\nBut what are the things that I cannot love you,\n\nI\u2019ve got nothing to love, or to love,\u201d\n\nThe voice of a child makes it impossible to hear her. Tchaikovsky is especially right about those early in a person\u2019s life. By the time puberty has been observed, children need to know what it means to love. In the words of the famous music teacher who made the famous Mozart, \u201cNo one can understand anything without a child, but we must learn to love ourselves.\u201d","token_len":592,"entropy":[11.0509,8.2312,1.3033,5.4382,3.9055,6.5744,0.012,0.957,7.5037,0.5669,1.664,10.6879,2.811,2.4135,7.2168,7.7413,1.7415,4.0275,0.1924,2.9218,10.3764,1.6493,6.651,1.2829,0.0894,1.1201,1.7882,3.5767,3.958,1.3956,1.5256,1.3259,1.691,5.6266,9.8344,0.7015,8.8023,5.9971,0.0327,0.0008,2.9156,7.1055,4.4989,8.3767,6.7618,5.4207,0.4488,1.8902,0.0052,2.2614,3.3039,2.4809,6.2344,0.3477,0.9596,5.9628,0.2251,5.2554,0.9677,2.809,3.3485,0.9669,5.5246,4.8803,0.0032,0.002,0.0017,4.3242,2.5913,1.7519,3.3809,6.602,5.73,7.1116,1.2437,6.2542,1.6826,2.9117,5.8597,0.0295,7.4721,2.0877,3.6767,5.927,5.745,7.4373,0.1443,0.0061,0.3233,6.002,6.483,2.3116,3.6943,4.2307,3.2297,3.296,5.7009,3.1727,1.0982,1.9507,0.3513,3.1165,0.0013,2.2505,2.1597,1.557,0.3315,0.0002,9.514,7.1466,5.5349,2.816,3.9329,6.4824,2.1499,2.691,3.7554,4.7213,7.0439,4.3055,3.2955,4.6654,2.0122,2.2488,5.1152,3.1699,0.27,5.6852,3.6452,1.4091,5.9386,7.2675,2.7249,0.7161,6.4874,2.5435,0.8716,1.5939,1.366,2.2144,4.194,5.7488,1.7307,3.209,1.6094,2.9825,14.7151,8.4637,1.4024,1.5698,0.6779,0.8828,6.0436,3.5166,3.2961,1.4682,1.3732,1.0126,4.9627,1.7253,4.0445,1.1362,1.923,2.6824,2.1639,0.4663,1.069,2.2488,2.305,0.1073,0.1221,1.4121,5.3291,5.325,0.7254,0.788,0.8993,1.2265,0.3266,3.5915,3.5383,6.9346,2.3303,3.1341,1.2562,2.4229,1.58,0.0775,0.2128,0.9112,4.33,0.7287,0.4179,4.9949,4.5616,0.8471,2.1605,3.4683,3.4134,2.2128,2.9675,0.4475,0.9823,2.2875,2.861,3.8729,1.0786,0.5346,0.0125,1.3553,1.9434,1.9898,3.4215,5.6749,4.0772,3.4079,3.9571,3.5853,3.061,4.0587,4.8875,3.4723,1.851,1.2374,3.9699,1.6689,0.7986,1.2662,1.0496,0.7776,2.3949,2.5442,0.0679,0.1619,0.002,1.4018,0.5561,1.8481,6.4337,2.2911,1.1259,4.1117,4.5341,1.0784,3.1684,4.941,1.7315,5.7363,6.3245,1.2183,2.7255,3.928,5.1186,6.5387,6.5384,0.0744,0.93,1.1168,5.099,2.0519,0.2184,0.9613,2.058,2.1738,1.309,0.0223,0.0637,0.0025,0.1898,0.1973,4.7179,2.0209,0.6646,0.0685,0.0513,0.0026,0.7843,0.4575,5.1317,1.5158,3.9223,6.7654,0.3981,0.0004,4.3669,1.8891,5.0559,2.8067,1.0966,1.3103,4.7437,1.0497,2.6552,0.002,0.0008,0.0011,1.9391,5.7864,3.2561,1.5845,6.6719,1.9126,3.9535,3.0155,0.9373,0.7846,5.5494,3.7624,0.3237,2.3124,5.49,6.5337,4.6294,3.3063,3.1586,1.4206,1.3578,2.3801,6.2233,4.2988,2.8381,4.0597,0.0002,4.699,2.1669,7.5042,4.2366,1.0927,1.4632,4.4626,1.4893,2.5964,0.6397,0.657,5.3992,0.6666,2.1403,5.6931,0.9392,5.6158,0.0014,2.0462,0.002,0.0008,0.0011,0.2163,5.2569,4.2236,1.5288,5.0833,0.0816,0.0133,0.0896,5.1399,1.1659,0.3896,6.4084,4.6474,1.7818,4.5687,0.2545,1.8391,0.0991,0.0007,2.8239,0.2563,1.244,6.356,3.2492,2.6261,4.5503,1.131,5.9925,2.471,5.3515,0.8525,6.6502,1.1952,3.2043,10.2544,0.1672,1.2626,3.0013,2.5042,1.7569,3.0254,4.1561,4.958,2.1525,0.0102,5.3655,2.7405,3.1245,2.7004,0.7335,0.0002,5.0517,0.9474,1.2801,0.0724,0.4099,3.7753,0.2961,1.6097,0.0027,0.0012,0.0007,1.2532,4.6641,1.3671,0.2896,0.0002,0.9334,0.375,5.4339,3.9258,3.7376,1.3357,0.3307,0.0851,0.6204,0.2672,4.7953,1.0959,0.8759,0.1974,0.0167,0.1409,0.0658,0.0223,0.2344,0.3716,0.2193,0.1436,0.0087,0.4454,0.0001,2.111,0.4535,1.7372,0.3541,0.0135,0.0131,0.2167,0.1596,1.8538,0.2437,0.2824,0.0158,0.0025,0.0506,0.0188,0.0106,0.1317,3.2956,0.0002,3.6425,4.2788,1.0215,1.094,6.1392,1.2105,0.7683,1.2982,0.0003,3.2583,4.602,3.6829,3.6443,1.3108,1.9881,4.9899,4.5511,1.3042,2.2994,0.6893,0.0002,3.3618,1.9352,1.0707,0.4329,0.0399,2.1202,0.6678,4.1396,0.2963,0.3784,0.7652,0.0682,0.0001,2.3959,5.741,0.4506,3.161,3.2911,1.6274,1.3283,1.845,2.0637,5.4412,2.5609,0.906,1.0927,3.2796,3.405,0.0831,0.0002,2.6472,5.351,0.9965,3.354,2.0766,5.7858,2.5419,3.902,0.5263,4.408,4.9029,2.4863,3.2744,0.0053,0.001,0.0005,2.8082,6.0896,5.9791,1.5107,7.0513,5.8897,6.0525,5.8499,5.1399,3.1776,0.5373,0.8762,0.3459,1.5869,6.0309,1.0958,0.845,6.8238,2.8895,3.5953,7.053,0.3666,3.1478,5.9776,1.9805,4.1169,2.7888,2.8693,0.9057,0.1855,3.9436,1.3269,2.9041,1.7567,3.8287,0.0118,2.053,3.9535,5.6427,1.4243,5.0693,4.8892,1.3809,2.0662,6.2543,0.0029,2.606,2.3676,1.5624,5.6518,2.2538,1.7836,2.8404,4.0257,2.434,2.6689,1.2937,2.6767,3.1934,3.7185,2.013,2.9958,1.2124,0.3203,1.8386,0.9728,4.5124,1.3783]}

In another clip shared in the \"Night The Moon Was White\" trailer, a scene where the moon takes an eye out of the glider will also be shown.\nThe green-lit 'Night The Moon Was White' film also has star-studded music and a sound effects theme.","token_len":592,"entropy":[7.298,4.0027,4.8371,5.8421,3.6376,5.5084,4.6028,2.9339,6.2449,5.9849,0.5165,6.2003,4.5069,7.1115,5.4485,1.4306,4.3116,5.0452,1.9847,9.0903,5.9558,6.2019,0.2692,5.28,0.2385,0.0174,2.3997,1.7596,3.6467,0.0073,0.002,2.3525,8.2154,2.2134,4.6069,0.7376,4.8256,1.5812,7.6428,4.1828,2.4453,5.0255,2.6114,6.105,5.8244,2.954,0.1137,6.9661,7.581,0.6925,3.7417,1.0515,4.5713,5.1649,2.5123,5.5914,0.6942,0.3899,7.7694,3.4397,1.8437,5.3601,5.4558,4.4064,9.312,6.6407,2.2716,4.2742,6.5114,2.2949,4.179,1.2439,4.059,3.9058,1.579,4.3472,2.3951,2.2883,3.1639,0.0466,4.8807,5.1056,2.9752,0.5815,1.7429,4.7225,3.8738,5.1854,0.8722,1.2666,0.6101,0.6201,5.015,4.9732,1.4614,0.8617,0.0468,6.5431,0.719,4.3776,3.5833,1.5346,1.4746,3.6411,0.045,3.0736,2.7096,0.0231,1.0673,6.2457,4.5332,3.7937,1.1776,3.915,2.2536,3.516,1.7248,5.9276,4.2036,2.0489,0.6095,0.4944,1.4058,5.2424,0.0344,0.2546,0.1089,0.0019,0.004,0.1671,0.0663,0.0397,0.0006,0.0042,0.0024,0.0032,0.0045,0.0074,0.0008,0.0073,0.0048,0.1516,0.0247,0.5093,0.0034,0.0086,3.9313,0.0001,0.0022,0.1365,0.0167,0.0242,0.0043,0.0148,0.0011,0.002,0.0005,0.0001,0.0008,2.2398,1.125,5.6728,1.7584,0.4691,4.8163,3.5711,3.5493,3.2895,2.505,1.4564,4.9693,2.4042,4.3288,8.6466,1.2565,1.3948,2.6813,4.2727,2.2671,1.2831,6.4975,3.3834,6.4427,3.1323,2.5781,5.028,4.372,2.1697,0.4659,0.9436,4.115,6.6553,2.5854,0.479,3.1252,3.1923,0.4994,4.1838,3.4164,1.753,2.3551,3.8218,1.3463,0.2846,4.6773,2.3302,3.1515,3.0698,0.9218,1.6584,0.1977,3.2675,1.0276,4.0088,3.7555,1.7738,4.1364,4.5545,3.2534,2.2263,3.79,0.8715,3.4078,1.1621,0.1964,6.614,4.5992,5.9012,1.6786,1.6874,0.9797,0.2063,3.1914,1.0587,1.9047,0.0632,0.009,0.0056,0.0012,0.1935,4.2883,5.5647,9.4468,2.2301,3.6282,3.1892,6.3291,0.6929,4.9632,0.5571,2.4328,3.2694,3.1113,4.3157,0.7108,6.0385,3.4075,6.3388,0.118,0.4873,0.5378,7.0069,1.6516,6.2712,1.2986,4.929,1.4584,2.1225,1.7003,4.7569,3.3314,2.668,2.1136,0.1546,0.3545,0.353,3.445,4.6404,4.6297,6.7127,1.5538,0.6857,3.7159,3.796,6.1657,2.374,4.7566,0.7574,2.3276,2.615,0.1786,2.6258,2.7131,0.6488,3.1863,0.4577,5.614,0.8223,1.0286,0.3061,3.8587,2.9162,2.8892,3.6702,3.0521,0.7347,4.3172,9.3127,3.937,1.7236,6.692,0.0096,0.0014,3.9203,2.0647,0.1024,1.5317,0.8164,0.62,0.178,0.015,0.3294,0.9345,3.1968,1.0337,6.1693,0.2164,1.0443,0.1016,0.8097,0.005,0.7656,0.3081,0.0882,0.1713,0.0251,0.0678,0.0071,0.0005,0.0131,0.6287,1.2486,4.8103,0.0013,0.0032,1.5948,0.0215,12.5319,2.3709,0.9038,0.0128,3.1896,3.8625,1.7683,1.0863,0.6448,0.367,4.5535,0.7236,2.6828,3.5226,0.7118,0.8993,2.2246,0.914,3.7259,1.4229,1.5333,0.0135,3.4471,0.0185,2.0952,0.2889,2.249,3.3529,4.2691,5.8967,1.8235,1.2273,0.4981,5.5209,0.6205,6.3142,4.0935,0.0645,3.189,2.1891,0.6138,3.7386,3.0998,1.9662,2.5856,0.3553,0.6482,0.739,0.0074,5.1381,3.4218,3.7129,1.9401,0.1459,1.4639,4.2368,2.7683,3.8534,0.2986,1.0997,5.264,3.3398,4.2252,0.0006,5.2769,0.3114,4.9503,1.9654,5.2966,5.8994,4.1119,1.5848,0.4483,0.0582,0.5371,0.261,1.073,2.0629,3.1915,4.8167,0.1217,0.9497,2.0262,2.0914,0.0504,0.0006,0.0323,0.2701,6.7705,4.1852,1.5269,5.7088,0.1734,3.8813,4.2108,1.8459,1.5642,5.12,0.0864,2.9509,0.4861,4.4111,0.0756,1.9987,0.5352,6.4901,2.9341,0.4006,4.3168,5.9758,2.3204,2.8102,1.0345,3.0595,5.2486,2.6269,4.3129,6.185,3.9518,1.8718,3.3392,0.9024,3.3756,0.9124,4.5827,4.4238,0.736,0.3934,3.5379,0.8616,4.0118,0.7335,4.2457,4.8227,1.3991,1.4579,0.6414,0.0171,2.1324,0.0444,1.3067,0.1973,0.8685,5.0773,0.6524,0.7589,1.1124,2.7184,2.9467,3.2479,0.794,2.3643,4.5739,6.0968,2.04,3.1681,1.22,2.5603,0.0182,1.4223,0.0765,1.2938,0.0913,0.5274,1.7026,0.0866,4.1676,7.1442,1.7828,3.5377,2.3746,0.1799,2.3232,0.3627,1.3848,6.6793,5.1246,0.0142,4.2911,3.1842,1.5458,3.6265,4.2711,0.5925,4.5964,6.2093,2.7993,6.5939,5.0528,0.5046,6.0336,3.0193,0.0978,0.0066,0.0121,0.0014,0.0564,1.0389,0.1946,1.484,5.0685,2.5774,0.8846,2.6372,6.1041,4.4218,5.05,3.8113,0.5719,0.5318,1.1973,0.0062,5.4161,2.7125,0.7206,1.6457,1.313,0.3076,1.1225,6.5386,3.4278,2.7705,5.4361,1.5798,0.0565,0.0052,0.0407,0.0008,0.0371,2.8852,4.0548,2.5968,5.5203,2.664,0.7925,0.0068,0.0005,6.216,2.2035,2.1897,5.2063,2.3786,3.8552,1.8564]}

{"id":1122,"ended":true,"length":562,"text":"Everyone with the same name shares knowledge. If one Bob gets a degree in electrical engineering, then all Bob's have this knowledge readily available. Soon, everyone starts naming their kids similar names until factions form. Your parents rebelled and named you something original. Now have your kids name each other after someone they knew. Maybe that's what \"new\" means to you. It will always be a way for family to have a family, if they keep their children \"original\" now.\n\nNo I did not, what I meant was not a child name, but a name, if you will, that shares everything and is \"original\", and is also unique if one named Bob \"Sister\" and one \"son\" and one \"husband\" also share similar things. One name is \"Bobby\" but there are also name and surname combinations for each as well. If your surname is \"Bobby\" in other words \"Sister\", then you can say either Bobby a \"friend\", or \"Bobby a wife\", or \"Sister John\" (I guess Bob's nickname).\n\nNo there are not any more names given. Just like no one name has given us a name in any other form for years or even decades.\n\nWhen did I say that my son wasn't original? Where did he have any trouble fitting in that name? It certainly feels like he went for a \"bio\" more than his predecessor. That's why we always keep it a secret, although at some points you can't really hide it.\n\nI am not a medical expert.

{"id":4189,"ended":true,"length":562,"text":"Everyone with the same name shares knowledge. If one Bob gets a degree in electrical engineering, then all Bob's have this knowledge readily available. Soon, everyone starts naming their kids similar names until factions form. Your parents rebelled and named you something original. Now have your kids name each other after someone they knew. Maybe that's what \"new\" means to you. It will always be a way for family to have a family, if they keep their children \"original\" now.\n\nNo I did not, what I meant was not a child name, but a name, if you will, that shares everything and is \"original\", and is also unique if one named Bob \"Sister\" and one \"son\" and one \"husband\" also share similar things. One name is \"Bobby\" but there are also name and surname combinations for each as well. If your surname is \"Bobby\" in other words \"Sister\", then you can say either Bobby a \"friend\", or \"Bobby a wife\", or \"Sister John\" (I guess Bob's nickname).\n\nNo there are not any more names given. Just like no one name has given us a name in any other form for years or even decades.\n\nWhen did I say that my son wasn't original? Where did he have any trouble fitting in that name? It certainly feels like he went for a \"bio\" more than his predecessor. That's why we always keep it a secret, although at some points you can't really hide it.\n\nI am not a medical expert.

As the world is now used to using passwords for everything including social networks like Facebook and Google, the number of people who claim they have lost their passwords has exploded.\n\nAccording to UK intelligence chief Michael Cohen, the number of people who have lost their passwords rose to 1.5 million from 1.3 million.\n\n\u201cOur cyber security experts have identified that the number of passwords that are still available for a relatively few applications on the internet to this date is estimated to be in the 50s, 70s and 90s,\u201d a spokesperson from the National Security Agency (NSA) told TorrentFreak.\n\nThe NSA had previously estimated in May 2015 that a typical password would last around 13.8 hours.\n\nSome cybersecurity experts have pointed out that passwords are usually password-protected or protected by only one of two things \u2013 one that\u2019s shared on a phone, and another that lets you know exactly which apps are trying to use your device.\n\n\u201cYou can get a free trial of your own password-protected app at Settings \u2013 although this can increase the amount of storage capacity on your device,\u201d one of the experts at IHS Intelligence, Tim McLean of the Electronic Minds Institute, which focuses on cybersecurity at the University of Reading, told TorrentFreak.\n\n\u201cIt also means that in order to recover your password, you will need to take into account both authentication and data protection,\u201d McLean added.\n\nWhile many tech companies are taking the trend of providing password-protected apps on their website, some experts say it\u2019s important that they give people \u201cthe protection they need to use it\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using a password-protected app and get hit with an internet connection problem, it\u2019s more important than ever to have it fixed. A password-protected app is the most likely source of access to the same device and access and maintenance required for the same password protected app. But it can also be a significant barrier to accessing and maintaining your password,\u201d said a spokesperson at the security firm Verizon.\n\nUsers often fail to remember their passwords, in a way that can be seen as an obstacle to password-protected applications, according to experts.\n\n\u201cPeople often fail to remember which apps they want to use when the internet isn\u2019t available or they don\u2019t want to look back with two fingers to see whether there\u2019s a password,\u201d said a researcher at the University of Sussex.\n\nPeople who sign up for free will be automatically asked to prove they have a valid Password, which has to be checked by cyber security professionals.","token_len":595,"entropy":[7.5775,2.9106,1.6602,9.5852,4.3483,2.0698,2.0046,6.4497,0.6341,3.6165,2.346,5.1172,0.5355,1.1727,0.0004,3.3598,6.5906,0.2309,1.7486,0.7483,6.0856,1.5845,1.1555,2.668,0.2755,0.9099,1.5,5.715,0.0007,2.4833,2.6813,2.5685,0.557,2.0317,0.1649,1.1137,4.2762,0.7094,1.3462,0.0234,1.3426,4.3606,2.3656,3.871,4.5075,4.002,5.4835,0.165,3.6702,2.3023,2.9506,1.316,5.7849,4.3296,2.4003,2.9417,0.4647,0.8946,2.3253,0.7069,2.2121,0.9345,0.2392,0.4557,0.7073,2.769,0.7829,0.3271,0.3411,0.0705,1.9952,0.5342,4.2927,0.3503,0.5767,0.0002,3.3056,0.005,7.2188,4.95,4.3691,3.9971,9.4351,0.1698,1.9802,0.9867,0.0918,0.557,0.5124,0.7254,0.5897,0.0818,0.6324,3.9002,1.983,2.6196,0.1007,1.3964,0.0795,2.4353,1.4653,0.087,2.5643,0.0193,2.1093,0.9767,0.0002,11.7676,7.8872,8.2797,6.5066,0.4821,2.2723,1.624,3.5615,3.7783,2.0666,1.0994,0.1064,3.2491,1.8471,1.8951,4.3855,1.8243,2.1851,3.3232,5.3166,3.5652,7.7169,3.8713,1.1885,0.8531,5.6104,4.5936,3.2393,0.9925,5.9691,0.3507,0.1859,3.599,0.2906,7.1497,0.9466,1.7974,2.2787,0.0044,0.5351,2.732,0.002,1.7345,10.2337,7.7826,4.2044,8.1729,2.9172,0.8695,3.2481,1.4077,0.081,2.1654,0.0033,0.0792,0.8408,4.8206,0.0839,0.0001,0.2782,0.3124,0.0001,2.0162,1.6531,4.405,1.7436,3.0431,5.0168,3.7574,3.598,0.0789,3.5483,3.8124,3.5245,2.6862,3.6895,3.601,4.7476,4.2125,2.8347,1.5738,1.1387,1.0848,0.0002,4.9554,7.6469,0.2608,1.4829,3.0036,0.3782,0.1241,2.9598,1.1491,4.5617,5.5584,1.4134,0.3044,4.6812,4.1575,1.0952,6.2468,1.6517,2.6492,1.7407,2.4057,3.3812,3.8279,2.379,19.1711,9.0375,3.4314,6.4458,3.1057,1.6405,5.9173,1.3115,1.6351,2.0995,0.1745,7.8626,1.366,3.413,3.6609,2.8779,3.6137,1.2307,7.4214,0.033,3.1585,0.6722,3.6472,0.6148,0.2287,0.0002,2.6654,0.4674,4.6357,1.1129,4.4436,1.6355,3.4746,0.787,0.0814,3.6015,3.5578,2.5815,3.821,0.3019,1.5535,3.166,7.4603,5.5014,7.7235,2.9744,3.6036,6.5435,1.3774,2.8961,0.2717,6.8318,6.6113,2.9415,0.1108,1.4777,2.3118,4.1771,3.3355,6.4929,1.1521,0.3365,3.8002,4.3422,4.9428,0.9107,6.752,3.6248,7.3624,4.6798,3.444,3.3915,2.2436,5.6764,13.4219,0.335,1.8997,0.7909,5.8094,4.5078,0.0212,2.36,4.7136,0.8768,0.7952,0.0051,4.2244,0.3989,0.4402,0.0965,0.0047,0.001,0.0741,0.1352,0.0002,2.1869,0.0982,3.5352,3.4974,1.9462,0.3776,4.7387,2.6058,0.1505,4.613,0.5572,0.7664,0.5859,0.4407,2.3985,0.6143,0.1785,4.2589,5.105,0.0845,4.7855,7.2048,0.6378,3.4803,1.5571,2.005,3.6751,1.7209,3.3699,0.0008,1.0106,0.0858,0.1458,0.0001,4.2268,3.0188,5.9825,0.5294,1.8003,3.9755,2.3979,5.9137,1.7429,6.8716,2.7799,0.7123,0.1335,0.566,3.0471,0.623,4.2745,1.5417,2.6436,4.7378,2.1524,2.4315,6.7931,0.4774,0.6475,3.4192,1.7374,2.1674,4.0257,1.9972,11.3406,0.9502,2.5745,5.0784,0.1194,0.6784,1.124,3.5296,3.877,2.7126,4.4813,5.7744,0.2175,0.0001,2.1053,0.0751,2.8133,0.4287,7.8483,3.1465,2.2699,2.2153,1.1609,1.3667,0.8648,0.0253,0.2242,2.7285,5.9985,4.1816,0.8392,2.1298,5.6561,2.1189,3.2457,0.3616,2.5782,2.274,0.2612,0.2271,5.3939,1.1545,2.4304,0.1465,0.8395,2.7067,2.9135,5.0996,1.9756,5.0759,3.7563,1.2356,0.1309,0.1346,1.6233,3.0671,2.63,4.2666,3.8657,0.0445,5.4552,1.5002,2.1361,3.9783,5.7309,2.5575,4.5823,6.0152,3.663,4.8137,1.1467,2.0773,1.1032,3.2197,6.8259,0.5859,0.7244,5.9411,2.7331,2.7495,1.0747,1.0005,1.6777,4.5525,2.9806,0.5409,3.1184,2.8314,1.3085,0.7306,1.9762,1.9184,1.2141,1.6434,2.5934,4.4326,1.1203,2.0216,1.5902,3.7188,0.7805,9.2906,0.4756,0.126,0.0001,5.2264,3.7659,5.4211,0.1046,2.2889,0.9663,0.7289,1.5481,5.7401,3.135,1.343,0.1556,2.2377,1.8204,4.3917,1.1745,2.3533,4.9971,0.3249,3.9626,2.0327,0.9052,2.5093,1.6111,2.15,0.003,4.3041,0.5539,0.3996,0.0002,1.7652,0.0637,4.9113,2.0523,2.7327,0.0223,0.4926,5.4212,0.5937,0.9033,3.464,0.132,0.7258,2.8398,4.5484,2.8512,4.0572,2.4975,1.6445,0.7586,1.6158,2.9126,2.9392,1.9088,0.1838,0.3437,0.0265,2.0782,0.1997,6.5784,6.139,4.8589,6.9988,2.0411,3.3761,0.8906,3.8235,3.8669,3.2823,0.1892,0.7157,1.1041,1.6343,3.7366,0.9998,2.2483,1.0169,2.148,4.3251,0.3718,1.6837,2.0523,0.0043,5.1257,0.8372,0.1466,0.0002,5.3134,2.0408,6.8204,0.0898,0.3254,3.6174,5.6041,2.3254,4.4328,4.7447,0.3346,5.6189,1.4003,1.1076,2.2926,1.8751,6.8813,3.1059,2.0108,4.7446,1.9637,0.2281,3.7661,1.2088,8.5819,0.406,2.8632,1.1472]}
{"id":2021,"ended":true,"length":557,"text":"Write about a seemingly kind selfless gesture that has an ulterior motive, one that is usually intended to destroy someone.\n\nThe motive for the act, or the perpetrator, is usually, if not always, motivated by their personal desire to kill.\n\nThat is why police need to be involved in these incidents. If the suspect is motivated by his personal desires, he will likely intend to destroy everything that is good in his life, including his loved ones and even his home because of this motive.\n\nThis is why police should not only be aware of the act of violence if it takes place, but also that it is the result of a motive intended to commit a crime against someone not only by his own mental capacity but his own sense of good might.\n\nThe psychological motive behind the act of violence that they attempt to inflict on innocent people is often the same as the physical motive in most cases, though a different method may have been chosen.\n\nThe mind of the attacker is also sometimes used to create a false sense of security or awareness for his target. So some attackers will attempt to convince their target he\u2019s being violent without ever knowing how much worse the attacks will be.\n\nMany people will use this same tactic to get the killer their victim\u2019s home or at least their cell phone.\n\nOnce a suspect is being charged, they usually want to convince the victim\u2019s father, brother, and even the other victim to talk with them to convince the suspect to attack them. When the suspect\u2019s attacker was found hiding in their own home in the southern suburbs of the city, these tactics have helped the attacker establish their own identity.\n\nIt is easy to see how many potential attackers can be fooled into thinking that they have a better motive for their acts than they actually do. There are different methods of getting the suspect\u2019s support for the violence, but it\u2019s always the perpetrator that will be the one to use to get their victim\u2019s attention and emotions out in the next instant.\n\nBy understanding the motivations of most people during this type of attack, police often can tell if any of the victims really hate others and would be happier if he were killed. If the attacker was motivated by his own self-interest, he could have turned a blind eye to his victims self-inflicted acts and turned them against him after they were discovered and confronted with him in a previous attack.\n\nIn order to get the killer\u2019s attention, police may take some of these measures. In the case of the perpetrator, they can use the victim\u2019s own mind to convince his attacker to attack him; it can be done by lying on the suspect\u2019s face; the attacker will also have his own mind about the perpetrator and what the other victim can do to get the attacker he\u2019s wanted and his victim\u2019s attention.","token_len":596,"entropy":[6.0771,3.5213,8.9431,9.875,9.6849,4.3464,4.648,2.7273,3.3602,5.9391,7.4404,0.0028,0.5468,1.9913,3.8975,0.5153,2.018,5.5247,6.0888,0.3505,6.7301,3.0103,1.7743,1.4546,0.0064,2.8346,6.5581,2.0386,1.9739,2.2799,3.2322,3.009,1.2972,5.4914,0.5973,0.6197,2.6437,5.459,3.808,0.8821,0.2133,0.2375,4.9056,0.0962,6.1512,3.6686,3.4114,0.8421,3.3981,1.0581,1.5467,0.0002,6.214,2.1224,2.3239,6.3868,4.4076,0.3963,1.2925,3.7406,0.824,3.0513,3.3557,1.1117,3.1089,1.9841,2.9305,0.9859,3.6884,0.3235,2.8089,3.1826,3.777,0.7394,1.8354,1.9437,2.0766,7.5988,0.2543,4.4336,6.4118,1.8637,1.531,3.8812,1.4443,1.4791,0.2197,1.7366,1.7338,0.8745,3.7469,0.066,1.9638,4.5053,0.8219,3.9703,8.7121,1.5197,2.8683,3.2576,0.1097,0.5088,0.0002,3.5167,1.2833,1.1661,2.0493,2.1848,2.7769,2.6115,1.2185,3.1444,0.1179,1.0241,3.9587,1.7216,3.1426,4.8591,0.8411,3.8739,0.0084,1.0744,0.0914,0.7504,5.2334,1.3097,1.0446,4.2724,2.8497,0.0102,0.9115,4.9171,6.7306,0.1425,4.6957,1.4943,0.3605,3.3142,2.2359,6.3698,2.6912,2.5347,2.9862,0.6407,6.1265,1.7729,0.9609,4.9642,1.5194,3.8095,0.0203,4.328,7.5347,0.3359,0.2964,0.0003,2.4579,6.8871,4.9858,3.3601,1.1091,0.4598,0.7673,0.2115,4.1297,4.9715,6.6825,0.0385,3.9875,0.9774,4.9536,0.7694,0.769,2.259,2.4045,1.5271,1.2841,0.4497,3.2918,1.2433,4.269,5.1538,0.8365,1.7612,4.0724,4.1033,2.2432,6.1343,1.7778,3.0078,0.47,3.4573,0.6078,0.3611,0.0002,2.0164,7.3342,2.263,1.0274,2.8408,1.317,3.8019,4.7678,2.9142,0.7125,3.2923,1.1863,2.6139,0.4188,0.0198,0.8389,2.914,6.2499,3.6622,2.6951,3.3544,0.4684,6.3519,5.8767,4.5241,2.1619,3.2089,0.0589,4.6598,1.9842,1.4044,5.2222,17.5544,7.8343,0.9314,4.6254,4.316,5.5207,3.0273,2.6122,3.6597,3.7394,7.288,2.5954,6.2439,0.794,0.8709,0.6095,0.3559,0.0002,4.5702,1.6116,2.3169,3.3986,1.7116,4.2396,1.5903,0.6983,3.8266,3.6622,5.5969,6.1095,4.3804,3.7613,0.1898,0.0276,4.569,1.8729,4.0269,0.4715,2.1516,5.6569,0.6292,1.0136,1.1308,0.0002,5.1176,2.2971,2.5738,1.4232,6.1237,4.8474,0.9816,2.3292,3.4251,3.4018,0.3036,4.8384,1.0374,2.0539,3.7199,0.0101,0.0173,4.5706,2.0216,2.3755,0.5774,2.5303,3.9705,2.5115,4.0193,2.6683,1.7053,5.1998,2.8187,2.2297,3.5974,3.7263,2.668,2.3835,0.9488,7.012,1.2862,0.4286,5.065,1.1572,1.9994,5.7166,0.0139,0.0008,7.3408,5.0454,5.5908,6.1279,0.7587,3.4314,2.5716,0.7618,4.0978,1.4262,8.0924,1.9296,1.1003,3.1687,2.4781,0.4543,4.691,4.9659,3.8747,4.9509,2.3794,2.9197,5.3367,4.5963,1.6572,2.5079,1.0691,0.275,0.0002,3.5136,0.3763,4.6477,0.23,1.9929,1.1764,3.8041,5.5688,4.2387,3.96,0.9124,4.5119,1.4546,0.629,0.773,1.1179,2.5229,1.7503,3.7661,4.6387,1.8443,2.1647,2.9632,1.0392,0.759,0.5293,1.8524,0.3454,5.0801,0.7346,6.0333,3.7198,1.3596,3.3404,1.6955,2.3734,4.9326,0.0074,0.0206,6.9459,3.917,2.7254,5.1004,2.0298,1.0332,2.8071,10.863,0.1616,0.009,3.4013,1.9255,3.4835,1.7382,2.6473,2.4099,1.6621,1.911,1.2058,3.4084,2.6343,1.9737,3.1071,0.8281,1.3145,0.004,0.0287,2.4293,2.2018,7.2897,2.2926,5.1958,0.962,6.4788,4.6444,0.1193,0.2069,0.0002,5.5632,4.0609,0.8869,2.6471,1.1086,4.7053,1.3164,5.2778,2.2277,2.9989,0.0008,1.6996,0.1492,1.6044,5.1681,1.1336,5.0196,1.9627,5.3012,0.6986,0.9796,2.4758,4.3052,6.129,6.1596,1.4006,4.9389,2.9754,4.6842,0.9214,4.8891,1.936,3.23,0.9172,3.4282,1.6855,3.152,2.7217,2.2165,0.2223,1.1662,0.5566,3.4737,1.3128,0.3598,0.5212,1.0096,2.8034,3.5141,5.4128,3.3292,1.089,0.0065,0.3237,2.3025,2.4519,5.7555,0.6443,5.0478,0.0085,5.6449,2.1697,5.5148,1.1705,1.5294,1.288,6.4748,1.9767,1.6821,3.8244,3.2641,5.0809,2.8915,3.8224,3.5024,1.9972,6.6359,1.5384,0.1505,0.2063,0.0002,3.3551,3.6603,0.1267,2.9638,0.909,2.721,5.8934,0.0041,0.004,0.9548,1.3423,2.7789,3.6407,4.8483,4.0634,1.9983,3.2564,5.6368,2.4409,3.6867,2.4335,0.9044,0.0406,1.7992,3.7909,0.6527,1.5327,3.263,2.0283,2.1901,1.8571,0.5449,0.0044,0.0048,3.2793,5.5279,0.5836,3.7287,3.4041,2.1948,0.8068,1.6775,1.4037,5.918,4.2291,2.5667,1.4103,1.5179,1.2503,4.7132,3.0878,0.5837,4.1009,1.0713,0.0058,0.0075,2.4974,4.1765,4.0212,3.2465,1.5176,4.5054,3.3094,2.9387,1.8175,1.1751,6.3999,0.874,3.695,2.353,4.1131,2.9742,4.7212,1.522,4.0064,0.8455,0.6253,1.7893,1.7395,3.2533,7.5654,1.3826,0.0063,0.0016,5.4436,3.0613,4.3588,2.7931,0.8725,0.001,0.0197,2.4335,0.5053]}
{"id":590,"ended":false,"length":560,"text":"Write a story that revolves around the first randomly generated word that catches your eye, and write one that doesn't.\n\nIn our next article we'll see how, and what, we can do to help you write meaningful stories that have a positive, positive effect on your career.\n\nHere are a few creative ways to make the most of your writing.\n\nWriting a story that includes, and includes, multiple adjectives\n\nTo illustrate our point, imagine a story where two people use adjectives to describe things that they like.\n\nHere is an example:\n\nWhen you tell yourself, \"OK, I had two words,\" it means, \"I have to choose one to use.\"\n\nYour first word has multiple adjectives (say \"I have to chose one\") to describe the first word they've heard, and your second word has multiple adjectives and descriptions to describe them. So both words have multiple options, all with their own specific words.\n\nOnce we've got you with your words, you can then create a post that details the first sentence and the second sentence. By editing your story, you can have multiple stories to tell; one where you want them, one that doesn't.\n\nYou can also add the word, \"choice\" or \"love,\" or use the word \"no,\" or \"you might have a problem with that.\"\n\nLet's set some examples of what adjectives do:\n\nYour second word has multiple adjectives (say \"I have to choose one to use\" or \"I've got to choose one to use\" and \"I've got a problem with that\") to describe the second adjective you heard, and it describes it in this way: \"I can pick one to use!\"\n\nYour third word has multiple adjectives (say \"I'm going to pick one to use\" of its own, for example) to describe the third adjective you heard, and it describes it in this way: \"I want to be able to pick one that no longer makes me miss one of my great-great-great grandchildren.\"\n\nThe fourth word has multiple adjectives (say \"I would like it if I were given a choice as to which choice to use.\") to describe either choice.\n\nYour fifth word has multiple adjectives (say \"I'd like it if it was given to me now and I should stop getting tired) to describe either choice.\n\nThese will also involve editing or adding in your own words, or adding extra words or phrases to your story. In the latter case you'll have multiple adjectives to choose from.\n\nNote: In some cases, you may also want to add in your own words or phrases to add a bit of extra depth to your story.

{"id":2757,"ended":true,"length":554,"text":"If you're in a world where physical health problems were treated like mental health problems, that would be the ideal situation for someone. Not sure a cure for physical health problems, but it might be an optimal approach for a few people.\nYes, but, if society is only interested in money, there are no solutions for physical health problems; what if the world is a place where people can afford to live comfortably, but there are other economic problems?\n\nThis is one thing, but to say that health and well-being is simply mental health related only to mental health problems is naive.\nYou cannot even try doing the opposite of what the average human person does: work longer hours on average as to prevent people from making mental health problems worse than others.\nYou should not just say 'well-being' to the public when you are doing physical health problems. People should stop being silly because we can do both equally.\n\nAs a result, more people don't need to be worried about mental health problems, because they're all mental health problems or just having fun.\n\nI agree. People should be worrying more about physical health problems, as opposed to what they see.\nThe idea that the population is inherently stupid and ill informed is simply wrong.\nI would bet that more people would be concerned with health problems at some point in their lives than they would of when they were poor.\n\nDo you know what depression is?\nWhat is the difference between depression symptom and depression symptom?\n\nWhy does depression generally seem to appear in a 'fear of having to die'? That would be sad.\n\nI believe depression is the result of a negative feeling of being depressed, even though you know that this isn't so. I don't think depression is a sign of poor self-control, per se. It might look like 'well-being', but is actually an illness that is present in many people, regardless of how much depression they have.\n\nI mean, is something so important as depression something people do?\n\nNope. Depression as a result of being depressed is usually something people do to overcome the symptoms.\n\nWhat about suicidal ideation?\nPeople often don't believe in hope. Their thoughts are usually directed towards either suicide or to suicide ideation. Some people believe in reincarnation, while others do not. In a sense, depression is not an isolated condition. Many people are self-motivated and motivated to solve their problems. So much so that they become suicidal. This is how most people think and feel. In the long run they may become sick and die.\nWhat kind of people will end up getting depressed? They may end up being suicidal, as they have suffered so much from their depression.\n\nDepression isn't a sign of the problem. It's simply an observation. It's like a person's perception of reality is a \"false perception of reality\".","token_len":598,"entropy":[3.2465,1.8113,3.5848,1.7917,6.6458,0.4366,7.0832,4.1688,5.9877,5.4481,5.6756,2.6257,3.9624,0.9658,0.5622,0.4912,3.6648,3.2806,0.4908,3.2545,5.2328,2.4768,1.7435,5.2975,4.0655,5.6225,4.6806,6.7478,4.9281,1.5341,4.0771,0.7405,0.7028,2.6686,0.5243,1.9741,3.4111,0.5985,3.2048,5.4774,3.2564,1.6975,2.4067,3.6077,1.4835,0.9056,0.7448,12.0069,0.1937,4.74,4.6973,3.1498,7.5459,2.5825,6.6457,1.606,0.0101,5.1572,0.718,3.5465,1.8887,2.4297,4.3075,1.8623,1.1815,0.3034,0.3999,5.5664,4.928,3.6747,2.4868,3.6371,1.7395,3.7855,2.4748,0.5027,1.7539,2.2128,3.2199,0.777,2.216,4.6318,1.6041,2.7932,3.4155,0.6772,3.4954,5.7536,2.1217,2.1278,1.2293,8.3072,3.8792,0.8612,3.3675,4.7692,3.3308,0.5561,5.0304,3.6176,0.5714,4.511,3.8725,2.4564,0.1216,0.0005,2.8773,5.1471,6.8092,0.2126,6.3184,6.2549,0.6168,2.9927,0.4623,0.7936,0.5845,5.8212,0.5435,1.8561,14.1554,4.0586,5.5524,5.4415,7.5475,3.0503,4.304,0.8982,1.3918,2.4996,4.8563,3.6253,3.5294,0.7967,3.3654,5.3742,5.512,0.5548,5.3095,4.0701,5.9409,6.8082,4.189,5.0503,0.1555,4.6755,3.3983,0.124,0.7739,0.5609,4.8396,3.7933,0.3171,0.7354,9.7967,3.8884,2.2812,4.221,2.964,4.9661,3.088,1.9755,0.1047,1.4878,2.5938,2.394,4.0671,4.8647,1.0499,1.926,3.4146,4.4387,0.563,1.729,1.1301,4.2585,1.3527,4.9603,2.5865,6.9335,5.2161,4.1925,2.9986,2.5172,5.6152,7.3252,0.9002,0.6085,0.0544,4.694,2.0654,3.3142,0.5011,5.7832,0.831,5.2834,0.0005,2.2964,0.8627,1.833,4.4572,0.1376,0.9649,0.0513,0.6155,1.7351,1.6904,1.4135,3.213,3.5978,2.2642,0.285,0.9904,5.7374,3.8901,5.5636,5.2403,0.6694,0.791,0.0003,3.1777,4.218,2.36,3.8516,2.204,1.068,5.2786,3.436,0.1464,2.8033,0.0296,0.5003,1.7837,3.8814,1.2018,0.0037,5.6208,1.5422,4.0202,4.8794,1.0358,15.0084,4.4007,0.4336,3.2403,6.1588,1.2884,5.8773,4.251,2.22,4.9124,5.7782,0.9016,3.4796,1.6903,0.3003,0.7744,13.9637,3.5195,5.7354,1.4142,4.058,0.3078,1.6205,1.594,2.9549,2.1115,2.9387,1.0442,5.2772,1.569,0.0913,0.9989,0.2606,0.19,2.8272,1.6014,1.6025,6.1233,7.9655,0.374,1.9781,5.124,0.5552,0.4799,0.0003,5.348,0.6222,2.8405,1.5225,6.7355,0.5044,0.5935,1.4904,14.6963,2.0409,2.3453,2.6947,0.0588,1.04,8.7393,1.4193,2.2432,1.0695,0.434,0.4296,0.0002,4.4839,2.4013,1.7833,6.2155,4.2425,0.3289,5.5838,1.7748,2.9077,6.8299,5.5188,2.1063,1.34,5.5299,2.4541,5.4835,3.0248,5.8195,4.3297,0.6731,6.0613,1.2081,0.3437,0.0002,2.5042,3.5222,3.1977,0.6924,3.4779,1.4788,0.0057,1.5019,5.9336,4.4908,1.2484,2.0437,3.434,1.625,4.7961,0.926,3.721,2.8349,1.2574,3.7188,4.1455,0.0004,4.5499,0.2793,3.9695,2.4845,0.0005,1.1706,2.6231,0.5814,1.6596,4.5243,0.2339,3.9732,2.5964,0.0992,1.5126,1.4224,7.515,0.0054,0.7883,2.0446,4.671,5.2791,0.794,5.1222,4.9775,0.7271,0.0367,2.2519,0.3587,4.8529,1.2067,2.9869,4.8136,1.2905,1.9103,5.7473,0.6537,2.7329,0.5436,1.9795,4.3864,0.0216,2.2614,2.152,4.3686,1.126,1.4804,0.427,0.3133,0.0002,2.1067,5.7448,0.3168,4.612,5.9001,3.7209,4.3797,2.7472,4.8693,3.8956,2.8599,2.8504,2.1479,1.4227,0.0002,6.4488,0.0996,0.6162,2.0146,6.0575,0.4305,4.447,0.0485,2.7331,0.5894,0.6593,4.5182,3.5958,1.9924,1.0932,3.5464,6.0715,2.7187,2.8258,2.0961,0.8967,0.0002,3.148,1.5062,6.1787,1.9948,0.011,0.1953,0.4367,21.3826,3.0531,4.3386,0.0007,4.071,2.4654,7.6338,1.8026,5.7173,3.0944,1.291,2.8287,5.1685,1.3579,6.1976,3.3983,0.2746,4.1882,3.6112,3.9367,0.0087,0.354,5.5522,0.4038,2.405,1.5965,7.3404,0.0193,0.9163,2.372,0.1816,3.5844,0.1354,0.2921,4.5098,3.2663,2.2807,0.1917,4.3176,0.562,2.9413,3.1762,4.9683,3.1812,0.8944,4.663,0.2338,2.2188,4.9406,0.0561,4.9379,0.0052,1.4585,4.2796,1.1927,5.0625,1.4729,0.6098,0.9427,5.122,5.61,1.3748,0.4827,1.5886,4.8011,3.0425,1.7517,4.1853,0.6937,3.8909,4.1062,0.3249,2.6298,4.3955,1.431,0.8106,4.6411,2.695,3.8277,0.2104,4.6418,2.2788,2.6463,5.1286,2.1768,0.7748,0.9919,0.596,18.6541,5.015,0.001,2.476,3.4541,5.3486,0.0261,3.8549,0.7372,0.5934,4.242,1.7024,2.6052,0.006,2.4423,3.057,1.7977,3.4882,2.1036,3.0658,5.3359,4.2649,0.3927,1.9517,1.9064,0.9556,0.443,0.9203,0.0002,5.0492,0.0687,4.1096,0.0005,1.4801,2.9532,0.1443,4.8804,6.3497,1.2748,0.8807,0.536,3.5485,2.1295,6.5836,1.223,2.2839,0.7331,4.297,1.9005,3.8586,2.1278,4.1974,0.1535,1.9217,3.1328,2.9869,5.8607,4.1868,3.9157,3.5013,0.2314,0.7089]}
{"id":2409,"ended":true,"length":540,"text":"A new designer drug makes people brilliant for five minutes... 100 words\n\nThe Daily Telegraph is proud to have created a new fragrance that's 100 per cent artificial and has won the prestigious James' Health award.\nIt's also 100 per cent cruelty-free and cruelty-free, and features artificial flowers for those with mild immune difficulties.\nIt's a bold product to be paired with salads and other items from around the UK and is available for \u00a318.95, but is also available for \u00a324.95.\n\n(Image: @Jules_Eckard) (Image: @Jules_Eckard)\nIt was created in the US. The line was inspired by the 'Friedman Method', a method of making foods that increase the health of a population by eliminating the need for animal produce, which is in many cases the biggest food-producing nation in the world.\nThe brand was also awarded the James Health Award. The award was launched in 2012 by Health Secretary Ed Murray and is administered by British Health and Welfare.\nThe first fragrance and launch for the brand was announced on Thursday night by Health Secretary Alex Azar and the first fragrance to be announced is a new creation created in Los Angeles.\nIn addition to an all-natural fragrance, the new James' Health product is also meant to mimic natural ingredients. To this end, the brand is developing an artificial flower capsule that's 100 per cent artificial.\nThe rose plant is also expected to be the first fragrance to be unveiled in the UK. According to the company, the flower capsule is produced in a lab and shipped to the United Kingdom and the US in order to reduce the health risks of plant-bound ingredients in the product.\nThe brand has teamed up with the National Association of Horticultural Growers (NAHG), and the team at the Natural History Museum to develop the product.\nIn addition to it being a fresh, plant-friendly scent, the new fragrance is also being produced in an entirely natural packaging. This meant no organic materials had to be extracted from the product. Also, most of the ingredients in the product are natural and are derived from plants which would make it easier for the product to be packaged properly.\nThere is also a chance it could be inspired by an organic plant at work.\nThe James' Health award is the highest award for an Australian fragrance made from natural ingredients and is given annually to those who are \u201cworld-renowned for their unique and delicious botanical beauty, creativity and food for thought\u201d.\nThis award is the first time that the fragrance has been chosen as the first fragrance to be awarded for this award.\nThe
