Goater scored three goals in the three games \u2013 on the pitch and off it.\n\nGoater was one of the most talented players at the Etihad Stadium while he was on loan at Reading, including having played in the first team between 1997 and 2001 \u2013 being named Man of the Match at the time \u2013 with many pundits calling for Royle to be recalled.\n\nRoyle said: \u201cGoater came into this game, playing on and off the pitch, and it was a great opportunity to learn as a footballer.\n\n\u201cYou had to deal with the quality of the players in the game and the strength of the teams to cope to them.\n\n\u201dThere has been a certain consistency in the way we've played the whole season and I think that's a testament to him and his coaching ability. He is going to be in big areas this season.\u201d\n\nGoater has featured regularly during the Manchester Utd transfer window, winning the FA Youth Cup and the British League One Youth Cup with Reading, winning and losing the Women\u2019s League Cup, National League, FA Ligue and the FA Women\u2019s Super League\n\nDon't miss out on all the latest breaking news where you live.\n\nHere are four ways you can be sure you'll be amongst the first to know what's going on.\n\n1) Make our site your homepage\n\n2) Like our Facebook page\n\n3) Follow us on Twitter\n\n4) Register with us by clicking on'sign in' (top right corner).

Several tree limbs and small trees were blown down across the island. Rainfall fell between 60 and 100 centimeters between the first and second days of the summer months.\n\nIn Hawai\u2018i, the Hanalei River was also flooded in summer, with strong floods that washed out the Hanalei River on Aug. 22 and triggered the evacuation of all schools.\n\nRainfall for the second week of June was around 675 mm.\n\nThe official cause of the extreme winds and rainfall was thunderstorms.\n\nAccording to KTVI, the rain was so strong that it had left several trees down on Kauai, leaving about 1,000 trees down as well as nearly 700 potholes.\n\nThere has been a sharp increase in the recent increase in water levels caused by heavy rains due to heavy snowfalls, but there was no reports of water leakage.\n\nAlthough most areas were under a period of heavy water due to snowfall, the waters below the Kanako River reached depths of about 70 cm where rainfall was falling.\n\n\u201cWater levels and water flow in the Kanako River\u2019s waters have been extremely high and the flows within this river are very high,\u201d Maupinio said. \u201cIt is considered an ecological problem.

Tina M. < unk >, the show's actual craft services woman, portrayed Tina, is one of the creators of \"The X @ -@ Files'' story \". Her role has always been as a craft worker, but as an executive producer she's been the one to make it \" happen.\" She did do some creative stuff with the X @ - @ Files' story, but has never been a craft guy. Tina was the one who took the \"creative steps,\" like creating a video and working with Matt. She'll be leaving \"Deadshot\" as producer. Tina will remain as an overall member on \"Deadshot,\" but there will be a chance for a more significant role on the show to come. Tina won't make any other \"Deadshot\" crew decisions until we've seen the whole \"X @ - @ Files'drama, but there's no word on that yet. Tina is in charge of creating both the \"Deadshot\" and \"Deadshot X\" scenes for \"Deadshot\". Tina also will appear in all three \"Deadshot\" movies (SJW) and work directly with the \"Deadshot\" creator, Matt, on the rest of the content management and creative work. Matt will do most of \"Deadshot\" as production designer on their set, as well as the overall production design on the \"Deadshot X\" scenes. Tina and Matt will also produce \"Deadshot 2x2\", which could be for the first time ever, and maybe \"Deadshot 3x3\", probably both for the \"Deadshot\" movies. There's no news right now on how \"Deadshot\" production will turn out, though.\n\nThis content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

{"id":4055,"ended":false,"length":367,"text":"In January 1904 six specimens and an egg were collected by Albert Stewart Meek, a bird collector for Lord Walter Rothschild, near Choiseul Bay on Choiseul. Several local boys told Meek that the birds were worth some $300 each. They told him a few local men and women, including a retired English soldier, who would buy two pairs of their first-hand, if they would only keep \"one.\" A later American historian, James Vann, had said that the birds were \"unlikely to be collected much longer\", and said these are \"perhaps best preserved as eggs and little, if any, of the meat, meat and water they were making.\"\n\nAt the beginning of April 1904 Meek had acquired several specimens of birds lying about in London and Paris. In one specimen as early as October 1904 he had described a pair of three-legged and three-quarters scale birds lying about in the vicinity of London's Metropolitan Opera House, also known as the \"Gothic Theatre\". All three birds had been preserved in wooded pits which were close to the stage, and all had been laid in the same places, with the exception of the third, or possibly first, of the specimens. The third, or perhaps first, was a bird of the wild described as early as November 1904 where it had been collected, but was actually in many different places. The third bird had been an individual of the same species where it was laid almost at the top of a pit. The pit was one of the most important places in nature, and this site was covered only with stone. On the other side of the pit the birds were lying at the bottom of a few stone shafts.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\n\nAlfred Stewart Meek: British Bird Collectors (1905)\nAlbert Stewart Meek Museum of Natural History, London\nT.P.T.

{"id":1081,"ended":false,"length":377,"text":"The video begins with the sound of a ticking clock and Levine and Rihanna sitting opposite each other at a table, tapping their hands and staring at one and other. As the songs progress the clock slowly pops, then stops as they begin to grow louder. Then Rihanna, who has said that it will take until she has time off work in order to sleep, says she can't \"be still any longer.\" Levine says he did the clockwork on his arm and then the hands on his thigh. It then goes down until she reaches the table. \"The clock is just like my arm, and I can never sleep,\" she says. \"If you turn it on, you will see the clock ticking like clockwork. A clock that is clockwork won't allow me to sleep as much.\"\n\nThe video then repeats as you can see Rihanna sitting at a table, looking at Levine's hand. \"Are you okay?\" Levine asks, standing next to her.\n\nThe video ends with Rihanna staring at both men, looking right at Levine.\n\nThe music continues as you can see that Levine's hand is vibrating and moving, as does Rihanna's hand, as she continues to sit at Levine and Levine\u2019s table\n\nSo what does this have to do with anything, I suppose?\n\nWe really need more of our favourite musicians, not just singers.

Fraser and Navarro write that it is doubtful that Evita ever expressed a wish to be embalmed, and that the body was never intended to be used.\n\nThe journal's founding editor, Dr. David Marquez, later admitted that he has no recollection of having met or talked with Evita, and \"I am now very skeptical of her true intentions.\" The journal notes that Evita's death \"resulted from a drug overdose, which was not the result of any accidental drug use... and she suffered extreme pain and morbidity.\"\n\nOn March 20, 2009, Evita's death was confirmed by the Coruscant Police, but the journal notes that the circumstances surrounding Evita's death made the decision to embalm them unnecessary. Evita's body has been deposited in a military tomb, which she was never recognized by anyone.\n\nOn May 4, 2009, in order for the Coruscant Police to determine Evita's identity, they identified the body as \"Erika S. Carlin,\" an unknown person who had been in custody for nine months, or had been captured by the government. The paper writes that the coroner identified Evita as \"She-Lyn L. Marquez,\" though L.M. Marquez was actually \"She-Lyn L. (Tamarina) Valdez.\"\n\nIn July 2009, the autopsy revealed that Evita had become dehydrated, and died after \"several hours of sweating and severe chest pain.\" This prompted the coroner to declare Evita a homicide. The paper also notes that Evita \"did not have any medical conditions\".\n\nEvita's body was buried on Aug. 14, 2009 at the Coruscant Crematory, while Larissa Torres and Jody Miller made their funeral arrangements.\n\nExternal links\n Evita's Death in the Coruscant Police's autopsy\n Evita's Death in the Coruscant Police's autopsy","token_len":413,"entropy":[5.5154,10.3959,3.5532,1.6277,1.305,0.2318,6.6469,0.0857,8.2877,6.2971,8.538,4.9726,4.5869,11.7086,0.1441,1.6239,0.9854,1.8037,14.3206,2.9148,8.7112,0.4132,9.0447,0.9448,3.6153,2.8129,6.4267,0.7899,3.9735,0.0007,2.4254,5.9799,2.5369,3.3049,0.3677,2.6723,2.0976,0.0266,0.0004,1.2107,2.066,0.7959,1.9844,2.8203,0.6985,3.0668,5.3925,0.7669,0.2204,4.705,1.874,1.3594,0.0026,2.1196,5.8512,3.0771,7.9219,1.7131,0.7201,3.1625,0.002,3.7809,6.0997,2.8575,0.296,3.9943,3.3517,0.5326,1.5888,5.8463,2.2136,1.9725,0.0586,3.0097,3.1457,2.9198,2.4387,1.0549,0.914,0.0002,1.8627,1.2087,5.724,2.6136,2.668,5.8923,4.1923,3.7118,1.1231,3.5508,6.8017,1.2989,0.7019,3.0398,0.6499,6.3465,0.2471,2.8501,0.0009,1.6614,2.4917,1.7607,6.1649,0.0406,0.525,1.2356,6.115,0.4781,1.696,1.7232,2.2462,2.1618,3.5655,2.2562,0.0453,2.2334,5.1522,2.1132,1.5125,6.6671,4.5155,3.2382,3.9429,6.4379,1.8148,1.3804,6.8801,0.4462,1.3498,0.8213,0.0002,4.6729,2.9237,3.333,0.0418,4.1376,0.0688,3.2886,0.0009,1.2694,3.4131,0.4965,3.5529,0.6064,1.1157,6.1124,7.903,0.0322,1.808,5.0966,3.8829,1.8278,3.4261,3.3994,0.1813,1.8841,4.8527,1.1191,2.2036,0.0007,0.0231,0.0736,4.8764,2.2796,2.1906,0.7932,1.9006,0.0093,7.3523,4.7539,0.3282,4.4079,0.0014,0.8734,2.6041,4.5794,1.0015,6.1282,0.4101,0.9826,6.3294,5.1167,1.9407,2.6524,4.1509,2.0679,3.1848,6.1538,0.9671,3.849,1.2483,0.7274,0.0002,3.2796,1.9974,3.0692,0.0191,1.2531,0.0331,5.0667,5.1847,3.8599,1.1777,3.2655,0.0289,0.0089,0.4061,0.1591,3.8411,3.679,0.0006,0.0192,2.3072,0.2279,1.4224,6.0098,1.8979,0.8308,1.0417,2.6705,4.3789,4.4944,4.8594,1.4549,5.7041,4.2046,2.1805,3.1655,3.4422,2.2705,1.7241,1.4816,1.1301,3.1183,3.2222,1.1441,5.2338,0.9969,2.596,5.3199,3.3941,0.6425,6.3598,1.6854,0.7092,4.3493,0.8809,1.8375,3.6991,4.2038,0.3991,1.8489,4.393,5.0697,1.762,0.0022,0.4142,1.602,5.9062,5.1912,6.0768,7.6414,0.3926,6.4997,0.0838,1.0151,5.3347,6.6832,0.4134,3.7409,0.0773,2.0577,0.0005,1.5136,4.707,3.3332,3.3158,0.3529,0.3731,2.1681,0.2315,5.8558,5.7403,5.772,3.7007,0.9034,6.3657,0.314,1.3422,0.9093,0.0002,2.4733,3.7184,0.9012,0.0383,1.2325,5.967,2.4833,0.314,0.7543,0.0022,0.8806,6.6639,3.1532,0.0005,1.4598,1.1906,3.7489,3.598,3.6,3.4636,0.0086,1.1445,0.59,4.7195,1.0975,6.7451,4.8683,0.5754,0.6587,4.4073,3.4751,0.9913,1.8368,0.0748,3.0582,2.4525,0.0023,2.4656,2.2071,1.2317,1.8666,1.7856,2.4936,0.9774,0.0872,1.7863,0.0018,2.6027,3.2582,0.0729,2.1892,1.117,3.8575,3.2111,7.2165,0.5409,0.0001,4.0571,0.0148,0.8851,2.3234,0.2877,3.9407,1.4663,4.6546,0.0214,3.507,0.0998,0.5734,3.2515,1.0557,3.1374,0.0358,0.0085,6.7222,0.7622,2.3161,2.8602,4.872,9.5648,2.0794,5.4815,2.4142,6.0406,2.7037,5.6548,5.9267,1.4261,6.8759,0.542,0.4523,1.1848,0.0002,7.4284,1.0019,0.9356,21.5658,0.0104,0.7217,2.8318,3.2226,1.9024,2.4969,0.005,0.0131,2.1611,4.6918,5.5347,1.7906,21.1287,0.0209,0.3265,1.7074,0.623,0.1335,0.2441,0.0019,0.0133,0.523,0.1818,0.165]}

The first @ - @ detected invasive mole cricket species was Neoscapteriscus didactylus, a new species which is known to be capable of carrying invasive species, a discovery by Prof. Dr. David O'Sullivan, of Boston Harbor University (Chesapeake, Maryland, USA).\n\nIn spite of current knowledge regarding the true nature of this species, the researchers have proposed that neocytosis can be induced through one of several means, from the body water.\n\nThe researchers also propose that the disease could be induced by drugs and antibiotics, which would lead to toxic lesions.\n\nProfessor O'Sullivan from Harvard School of Public Health observed that the introduction of invasive species to native environments as early as the 1950s may have influenced the transmission of invasive species and its effects on human health.\n\nProf. Dr. O'Sullivan's findings revealed that the presence of invasive species is more prevalent and that the number of species species is significantly higher in the water around rivers than in any other environment.\n\nTo date, there has been little evidence for the existence or prevention of invasive species in freshwater.\n\nIn the past, researchers have relied upon invasive species as a key component in the protection of native landscapes. They have also found that invasive species in the freshwater environment (i.e. the rivers) have a specific capacity for the production of chemicals, which can be harmful to animals, such as fish.\n\nDr. O'Sullivan says that for many of the invasive species that are listed as pest free, there are significant risks associated with their introduction into a protected national park.\n\nThere are also known cases of invasive species in the water around lakes, and in the vicinity of ponds.\n\nProf. Dr. O'Sullivan says that the current method is to rely upon a combination of genetic testing and drug therapies to remove invasive species, which can lead to toxic lesions and damage of the body lining.","token_len":415,"entropy":[11.5435,2.4993,2.0893,6.1751,0.7433,3.4348,3.8776,3.1996,3.7132,11.6197,7.1216,6.3572,1.2805,4.3742,7.8755,3.7633,4.0168,0.6378,6.6518,0.9998,2.6181,4.4892,13.9459,8.9427,6.4716,10.4867,5.9837,11.7573,10.6532,3.5139,1.6371,9.5868,7.0058,8.0121,9.8224,0.5088,9.7935,5.3077,5.9216,0.7551,1.9918,2.0215,4.6003,1.3929,4.4381,1.9854,4.2372,0.2362,1.5747,4.6165,0.0045,4.3754,4.4345,1.9471,2.7685,4.5739,4.3365,4.2514,4.3859,0.6375,4.6059,0.1063,4.566,4.9342,1.0529,3.5082,1.6821,1.7333,6.8337,6.0101,2.4334,3.8954,4.2242,6.5507,0.7133,3.8952,3.0244,2.6032,0.1151,0.8478,1.9891,0.0027,3.0415,7.4614,0.0137,6.1603,3.472,3.4246,0.7231,4.6768,1.8877,0.0938,2.9244,1.4074,0.2821,1.8671,4.1671,2.6643,5.0658,1.1863,5.0905,7.6933,1.6629,0.3095,3.1334,0.8456,3.4756,2.8081,5.6754,0.5163,1.7171,3.0878,1.7471,4.91,2.483,5.3604,7.3668,5.2338,2.4057,0.0003,1.99,2.9549,3.9553,1.3799,0.4282,1.5782,5.16,2.8198,0.542,2.2098,0.9645,6.4283,3.4216,4.9083,1.431,2.0199,2.6457,4.7674,0.0358,6.2681,5.5748,2.3936,0.9533,0.0004,4.4683,0.8204,0.0009,0.0045,6.9129,2.9364,3.3983,0.026,0.0702,0.0005,6.4776,1.0186,1.4987,8.2014,0.0305,3.9486,0.4977,2.4522,6.754,3.8787,6.1157,3.4801,0.011,2.6912,2.8201,0.1524,3.0182,0.508,5.0705,0.6922,7.6486,0.0884,2.5323,0.1883,3.4906,4.3642,3.9279,1.0302,2.9939,0.2234,0.4237,0.4583,0.0002,5.088,0.1349,3.0251,0.0525,0.9729,0.0011,0.0034,3.0656,3.3153,7.183,0.4603,1.6067,3.5898,0.0619,1.7509,0.1952,2.6052,4.4584,2.2741,3.5001,4.6107,1.5906,3.4249,0.0436,2.9622,6.5417,3.2609,4.806,1.4871,0.9773,1.5657,5.9276,5.0068,7.1303,2.1219,0.6073,4.963,0.1481,3.8032,0.5712,0.443,0.0002,5.2061,2.3698,0.1439,2.1304,1.7074,0.2421,2.3323,3.119,2.9883,1.0648,2.5992,3.5429,5.009,0.0125,0.9248,0.1346,0.9921,3.0114,2.7128,1.3434,0.0003,2.9537,2.4449,2.7508,0.7284,2.9896,0.2526,5.5166,2.4493,3.7543,0.1455,1.3941,0.6562,5.5143,3.3828,1.6177,1.8636,5.1324,0.0626,2.5529,5.663,1.0834,4.2854,0.7593,2.1113,3.0636,0.3962,2.2468,0.066,3.7654,1.9328,3.6313,0.6753,5.5077,2.9423,0.0043,0.0007,1.1603,1.7294,4.0124,1.4527,2.586,1.714,5.6143,4.6835,1.618,4.0314,2.997,0.1109,4.6812,2.1381,1.6133,2.0942,1.3025,2.3534,0.3799,4.8188,1.8434,3.7902,0.0025,3.6359,1.1038,0.4545,0.0003,3.226,0.0169,0.2372,0.0018,0.0026,3.8676,0.5223,5.1962,2.9667,3.0223,0.7874,2.9518,0.0284,1.7007,1.4044,5.1947,0.9267,6.8017,7.6578,0.9003,2.4117,1.5239,5.027,3.3149,1.5926,0.03,1.7309,2.6081,1.8941,3.6723,2.9732,8.7889,2.7275,0.5909,0.4868,0.0002,5.4331,0.7537,1.6125,5.4117,3.3843,0.398,1.9454,0.1293,2.0712,1.2242,1.5804,2.8816,2.9258,1.5034,3.7416,2.4803,1.6159,5.0966,0.0289,4.6648,1.2699,0.8823,0.0002,3.6834,0.02,2.1736,0.006,0.1219,0.0014,0.0017,1.4903,0.2431,1.6018,3.345,4.6882,3.3079,2.7332,4.9,2.1608,2.5023,2.1323,0.0096,5.8289,2.3261,0.9325,7.1905,5.1241,1.4559,4.5105,1.6239,0.0609,2.4261,1.6433,2.4728,2.4217,0.0104,3.6065,0.1795,1.8322,4.7436,3.5883,0.6167,1.2958,8.1524,1.9305]}

Their attack did indeed cause some initial confusion, but Bryennios ( or, according to the reports, Pashtina) decided to proceed with his plan, to attack \"The Frontist\", his own army of rebels.\n\nIt was on this day, the fighting raged on through \"A\", a line which had grown towards the frontline. For the first 24 hours the battlefield had been full of Russian and Soviet troops, though the Germans and British forces fought through the Russian-Soviet line on and off along with Russian tanks and artillery, which were all moving quickly. Soon after 7th of June (August 25th) the Russian soldiers had fired in on and were repelled, as on the day before. After the surrender of Kursk on 21st (August 26th) the Russian troops managed to escape to the flank of Brest, where they were captured by the Germans ( and had to be rescued, as both men were shot in the leg, later in the day).\n\nOn 2nd day of the Russian campaign against the front, on 8th (August 9th) and on 9th (September 1st), the Germans were finally captured. Pshnina ( or, Pashtina) captured \"The Frontist\", his main enemy, after the surrender.\n\nAftermath\n\nOn 22nd (September 3rd) the Germans entered the village of \"A\", a fort which had earlier been bombed by the Russians. On 6th (September 10th) at approximately 8th hour the Germans entered \"A\", the main enemy. The objective of the retreat of the Russians were to establish \"Pashtina\", their main strategic foothold in the area of \"A\", while \"A\" was occupied by the rebel positions, as well as the surrounding areas of \"A\". After the surrender of the Russian troops, the rebels had left \"A\", which it now considers to be a strategic fortress.\n\nReferences","token_len":418,"entropy":[2.9307,9.5144,2.1768,4.6542,3.847,5.6238,8.2086,1.5433,5.1936,0.9544,8.9739,5.0518,4.4804,7.4143,5.1031,7.3618,4.7531,5.3403,1.5832,4.497,4.1675,5.2893,6.0651,3.1321,2.6891,6.5484,2.8186,1.1412,1.0974,9.9969,9.2055,7.6971,7.4057,11.8648,3.6516,6.9161,0.0007,1.5879,5.7632,0.8909,5.6126,5.5485,3.6658,4.0361,1.2287,5.0011,0.2635,5.8802,1.2101,1.4564,2.3809,2.8141,4.5099,3.4086,6.9704,4.3816,7.1368,6.8609,3.8587,3.9657,3.0651,4.1102,2.6867,4.0991,0.6902,1.8247,0.1375,4.5212,0.8603,3.839,0.9567,2.518,2.4483,3.6067,6.3463,4.0069,0.8573,4.8415,7.3055,4.7117,5.8784,2.998,5.6229,3.4896,2.4978,4.7198,7.3389,0.6609,5.9426,1.3066,5.0063,1.8058,1.3694,7.9965,0.0637,3.022,5.105,2.7769,0.5514,4.5429,0.0523,6.4655,3.1491,5.2257,1.9372,0.9325,4.9351,1.7099,6.0894,2.3822,3.4608,4.2364,4.9664,4.2634,1.4177,5.0559,3.3387,3.6072,3.0936,3.8547,5.8443,0.8905,6.3194,2.0448,3.8924,2.4619,1.0706,1.2362,2.3185,3.1129,2.2173,4.6225,5.4163,4.4778,1.6416,5.8469,1.5381,6.0004,4.5956,3.1512,2.7255,4.789,4.8595,4.3782,0.9691,1.2568,1.1098,2.4236,4.7954,2.2714,7.1268,4.7831,3.2008,4.9177,6.4312,4.5921,0.5108,1.8042,3.4137,6.5151,1.6501,2.2187,0.7769,1.9558,4.2146,1.9716,5.2048,0.3512,4.5574,1.2361,0.0348,2.5423,5.2474,0.3473,5.5928,0.3958,1.7791,0.0206,1.0574,0.9734,1.9744,2.2157,5.2203,0.043,3.7705,2.5298,1.3381,6.3599,0.1869,5.2651,1.6022,1.4868,1.4756,0.4592,1.2976,4.0158,0.7461,0.5303,2.2548,4.2383,5.6525,4.9744,1.2667,1.0275,3.0903,4.6515,2.2657,5.9255,4.8049,0.7845,4.2625,2.1152,0.2196,2.475,2.9954,6.1793,3.1689,0.6491,0.7547,0.985,0.8329,0.0002,2.4888,3.3658,0.0817,5.8085,0.7816,1.7975,3.3512,3.0952,3.7653,1.1497,3.8396,0.8766,2.6909,4.079,0.0032,1.6738,0.59,3.8799,0.0226,0.4582,4.8999,3.5167,1.0423,0.0209,0.1206,2.6979,1.6814,0.0128,0.6719,1.008,2.7382,2.2694,3.8324,3.7907,2.1604,5.6205,7.9466,7.0845,6.403,2.5761,0.6134,0.3649,7.8432,0.3099,0.117,0.0068,0.8105,5.1806,5.1509,0.9233,0.3277,0.0265,1.0795,2.9046,4.8479,3.2307,0.7113,3.3583,2.4921,3.8341,2.8477,1.5822,0.0002,3.2499,2.2491,1.0185,0.0001,2.4698,4.369,0.024,0.7538,1.2721,2.5957,0.0144,0.7053,0.8932,2.654,5.6013,0.9091,5.3457,0.1565,4.1158,1.9931,0.7571,2.7135,5.5247,2.3857,1.1287,7.2727,0.1586,5.6333,0.6305,0.588,1.0652,0.6082,3.1577,5.0827,0.0063,0.1846,0.2204,2.8984,0.0179,0.3229,4.9884,4.2928,2.8043,5.0374,3.5508,1.5879,1.634,4.1798,1.8647,1.1992,0.5396,2.4906,2.6082,2.5717,3.224,2.0211,5.9726,0.8205,0.6523,4.7678,2.4105,0.7902,1.9954,5.117,0.6905,5.3854,4.1233,4.5386,0.5353,0.1183,0.0113,1.3973,3.5274,1.974,6.2979,5.5496,1.288,0.4516,2.4436,2.4532,1.7366,0.3436,1.0792,3.6438,4.6197,1.3741,0.1046,1.0927,3.8985,0.102,0.5721,5.0317,5.3525,2.6141,3.1747,0.7966,0.0077,1.5317,6.071,2.9397,1.9103,0.9481,0.9669,0.8661,3.4462,1.3455,2.7798,0.2171,1.9994,2.2844,1.7385,1.263,0.8503,3.5332,2.8296,4.2218,1.3623,0.2928,1.0083,3.2342,6.3802,3.2072,8.3779,1.0061,0.1047,2.0864,3.1155,5.1977,0.9674,0.6277,0.0002,6.1353]}

The submitted names are arranged into five lists, each one with its own distinct category.\n\nIn addition to the usual categories, each island country has its own distinct category of disasters. Here are a few categories for disasters, the largest is that of \"A tropical cyclone\" which had an annual total of 30 deaths recorded in 24 local governments.\n\nIn addition, one island country is listed in the United States.\n\nThe United States is a country and nation of almost 5 million people. It has a high percentage of the population of 7 million people. One of the biggest disasters that caused by typhoons in the United States occurred in January 2001. The Pacific Ocean was already flooded with powerful water in parts of Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Most parts of the United States suffered the greatest losses as more than 7 inches of rain fell on the city and villages of Long Beach, California. In that area, water reached more than 100 miles of sea below the city limits. On February 5, 2001, Hurricane Sandy, or Sandy for short, was named \"Honeybadger\". In addition, Tropical Depression Sandy, also called \"Sharko\", also called \"Mushroger\" is currently located in Puerto Rico. The main areas of Hurricane Sandy were located in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Southern New Mexico, Hawaii, and the islands of Puerto Rico and San Juan. There were also several natural disasters that struck the island in 1992.

{"id":710,"ended":false,"length":374,"text":"A 35 @ - @ episode anime television series adaptation, produced by Toei Animation and directed by Takashi < unk >. It aired from May 20, 1983 to January 27, 1984, and was the best-rated series of all time in the series' life. The series was written by Takashi, who is a professor of animation at the University of Tsukuba.\n\nIn \"A New Way To Die\", Takashi provides the background music for the musical piece \"Shunsuke\", and then goes down to the musicals and the \"Mari (An Evening With Toho and Saito)\" to compose and write \"Toho\", which is inspired by the Japanese word for funeral (i.e. the term for passing).\n\nIn the first episode of \"Chakra Raku\", Takashi plays the violin in his bedroom and asks her to sing along with him to the music. However, she refuses to do so, and is instead singing in the background (in addition to her own singing, she is also participating in the choreography of \"A new way to die\", which was also inspired by Takashi's own music experience). A series of mini-programs, called \"Chakra Raku\" (or, as popularly called it, \"Chakra Raku anime\"), will be created in \"Chakra Raku\" which are meant to teach more effective and important skills related to the arts. Like other shows in the series, this series has a strong cast of actors who are able to use special skills for many of the scenes in \"A New Way to Die\", as well as others who are trained in Japanese and especially Toho.\n\nThere are eight episodes of the series and the series is broadcast on the popular television network Tezuma (Tsukuka) at 10pm, while \"Shunsuke\" is released from airing on the popular TV station Okai (Tokyo) at 2pm.\n\nExternal links of \u201cA New Way To Die\u201d: Toho\u2019s Official Site","token_len":421,"entropy":[9.1301,11.2032,6.4272,6.2708,12.2495,13.4054,9.3248,2.5674,7.495,3.1741,6.0897,0.1443,7.378,0.1391,0.113,2.6673,4.5789,0.0155,3.5997,0.8629,11.4282,10.5592,4.6433,6.7985,3.1242,3.7267,3.4616,2.5384,2.6684,3.7873,1.108,6.5829,0.3325,3.9175,3.9564,0.0189,0.9978,2.1476,1.167,2.0348,2.512,5.2098,0.8193,4.1789,2.9882,1.0972,1.0028,0.1308,2.2184,1.5702,3.2129,1.0236,7.7308,0.5301,2.0037,1.184,1.5385,3.6451,0.3688,2.7518,0.06,4.518,1.512,2.5454,2.4845,4.5458,0.5317,2.644,0.385,1.667,0.8658,0.0026,3.7219,0.0018,1.3122,2.2796,0.0041,3.1562,5.2397,3.6027,4.7338,4.9524,3.9271,4.4249,0.7143,4.0242,0.0232,6.2101,1.825,4.5935,2.2794,0.6842,0.6899,5.3531,5.048,1.465,4.3999,4.145,2.6858,0.5743,2.65,2.3263,4.2462,4.1984,6.3885,0.8834,1.0529,5.6867,5.5149,3.068,3.2898,4.7537,5.1808,4.6936,5.8232,5.6211,6.2892,2.0712,5.0581,5.4108,5.4588,4.692,2.3358,0.4176,2.712,3.3851,3.6263,3.0998,4.1949,3.9549,2.3641,4.6788,2.5079,1.228,5.8522,0.0461,0.896,2.938,3.8818,1.0447,9.1407,3.0711,5.1201,0.1589,0.0004,0.6382,3.5036,6.1643,2.0627,6.7442,3.6415,1.3173,0.0003,1.9143,1.4931,3.443,0.8588,1.1439,1.5546,5.1045,6.2876,5.9655,4.4784,2.991,1.9713,0.0167,3.5935,1.4842,4.3239,2.8526,3.0144,3.5963,2.3138,5.623,6.0785,0.7869,1.3219,4.159,1.7714,0.2806,3.5462,1.3358,2.8792,1.1423,3.6484,0.0631,1.6966,1.8812,2.2629,1.1071,0.1627,1.2226,1.3073,3.6825,4.4722,2.7489,3.0121,1.6937,1.1493,4.6851,3.5792,5.6242,0.0061,2.599,2.034,2.6293,2.8265,2.3127,1.8242,1.3549,7.3744,0.1177,0.8304,5.8562,0.1788,1.2023,2.0602,3.4844,6.2136,0.6157,0.0683,0.0416,1.4428,1.3239,3.0834,2.2728,2.3975,0.0258,6.2863,0.0147,0.1593,2.9848,3.532,7.8169,0.8232,4.9039,5.2749,0.1639,6.841,0.2864,7.233,0.6283,2.8201,1.8397,0.5647,2.5678,0.5281,0.4734,0.0224,1.9231,1.8286,4.707,3.8307,2.2415,7.0968,0.6627,1.7354,2.4476,0.7527,0.5697,1.5527,0.6579,0.5903,0.1895,7.1998,1.5546,4.7923,1.1665,3.6238,2.7105,3.8401,1.5097,0.0754,0.0924,0.002,2.2306,4.5219,3.8251,3.6625,0.0753,3.3739,5.816,5.2714,3.1239,5.3611,3.2205,4.9513,0.0125,1.657,4.2312,1.2557,6.81,3.2212,4.4214,1.9677,0.3571,0.2437,0.0887,2.665,1.8786,3.1467,1.4545,4.1663,4.1019,0.7706,3.4697,2.3363,1.3838,4.1757,0.0112,4.9458,5.821,2.2013,3.4695,5.8934,2.1167,0.2625,3.0848,1.949,2.0455,1.906,0.0824,0.0042,1.6998,0.0123,1.3787,2.8952,0.2314,0.013,5.409,0.6703,1.2008,5.0392,0.99,5.5862,2.1938,7.4286,7.0647,0.3958,1.2172,0.706,0.0002,5.0459,0.5673,4.95,1.8268,1.0122,0.8645,1.0954,3.5096,2.4322,2.1811,2.5836,4.4345,1.516,2.0387,4.9129,1.9789,1.3388,6.6449,2.6216,9.5921,3.5225,2.9061,5.4233,1.6711,8.3925,2.652,4.3391,3.4891,3.5229,2.6377,4.3124,3.4076,3.7072,0.1782,0.0078,0.0027,0.1891,1.0545,5.1027,3.6664,7.8473,1.1945,1.287,2.7027,1.9349,2.2099,7.1732,3.9328,2.454,2.5859,0.145,3.1803,0.3241,3.2452,1.1941,0.5098,0.8183,0.0002,7.2161,1.1744,8.6823,13.26,6.1905,4.933,0.4993,0.0165,1.1395,0.0019,1.7345,7.3562,2.3154,6.6444,0.4405,5.4844,7.1364,4.4711,5.3234,2.3719]}
{"id":1201,"ended":false,"length":376,"text":"In 1964, Simone changed record distributors from the American Colpix to the Dutch Philips, which also meant a change in the contents of her recordings. She had always included songs in her repertoire that were recorded in the US, but they were largely forgotten thanks to the \"new, wonderful\" US Colpix library. Many of these songs had been recorded by Americans, but they were not \"original\" at all (so had no connection to the original American records). The US Philharmonic Orchestra (now defunct) released several versions, but none of them became known as recordings by the British Philharmonic.\n\nIn 1968, Simone published \"Hessinger Behold\" again. This had been a long-distance tour that featured only the music in her repertoire. In 1968 She recorded on the International Broadcasting Broadcasting System (IFB). The project was a long-term project, which consisted of the whole album and much effort. It was also used as a basis for an album that is reissued with the most recent editions of the recording. Simone, in addition to being a music composer and vocalist, also brought with her a collection of recordings made by other artists and producers of the period. The work that Simone composed was included in a collection of her songs called \"The Song that Inspired Our Lives\".\n\nAnother project was created in 1973 in which Simone wrote and recorded an instrumental version of \"Grundyder\", the original song that inspired her music. To this date, other examples of Simone's work have been recorded by other singers, many of whom have remained close to Simone throughout her career.\n\nIn 2008, Simone published a new work, \"Serenity in Time\", a collection of songs that she recorded in her recording studios throughout the following winter.\n\nIn 2010, Simone also began recording her debut solo album, with some minor revisions, and released a new version.\n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums\n\nSingles\n\nExternal links\n \u201cSerenity in Time\u201d: Simone\u2019s first solo album","token_len":421,"entropy":[10.682,0.2297,10.6284,8.5446,11.8593,9.6482,2.5204,2.8206,4.3331,7.5196,7.4078,6.5765,1.4192,0.9027,6.234,6.1839,1.9332,2.4328,4.1665,6.1398,3.1067,3.0186,0.3308,0.964,8.93,0.1503,6.7686,4.8159,0.2985,2.4302,3.1214,4.3955,6.5517,4.5188,1.6451,0.5435,3.6931,3.1113,1.3042,4.4332,1.2651,1.5119,3.8518,1.0306,0.9629,3.8807,0.5429,5.6219,4.1098,8.4406,0.0215,0.9449,4.9294,5.703,5.3873,7.0416,1.1519,3.5137,5.5537,0.0152,0.0012,8.5059,0.7917,5.6539,0.4753,1.6233,0.8715,2.7345,0.9299,1.8499,2.3931,5.3833,1.4717,1.2257,2.3517,0.6334,2.1514,5.2003,3.5872,0.5161,5.0475,0.221,4.0466,5.0,6.7851,3.7155,4.0118,0.3302,0.6371,2.0666,2.272,5.5111,0.7341,2.6093,2.784,6.3921,0.3671,0.0127,5.2172,2.753,2.2115,5.9895,0.39,3.4915,3.1735,2.6886,4.0281,1.4407,2.7714,0.6734,0.3181,5.1535,4.0519,1.8485,3.6963,3.9679,1.231,4.0075,0.8479,0.0053,0.0074,1.3456,1.2324,0.0164,2.1732,3.1089,0.159,2.3098,4.5289,2.8241,5.3483,7.1809,5.4211,6.4063,4.9511,1.883,7.1822,1.9909,1.3177,6.3756,0.9112,1.9906,3.5604,1.5515,4.8239,3.9503,2.744,2.9236,4.1121,2.2068,5.6586,3.744,1.5235,2.122,1.2004,2.7206,3.3219,7.9153,3.5833,6.0207,1.9507,6.6435,8.5579,8.6419,0.7695,0.7666,5.2958,0.6722,2.713,2.0464,6.3361,0.8707,3.367,4.012,0.8007,2.2931,1.1198,1.1804,3.4699,4.6931,0.1567,3.2365,6.3516,3.3037,2.0295,5.4374,8.3119,2.2561,2.3573,0.7428,3.0591,5.6719,1.39,0.6357,4.3915,0.1253,3.2837,1.8201,3.1326,4.3443,7.4521,0.9661,2.5878,1.4272,6.7392,0.7526,4.3994,0.8804,0.8468,5.103,1.155,2.5564,4.3475,2.5993,2.399,0.0276,2.6122,1.2975,4.5497,4.0454,2.3631,3.9121,0.0186,0.2952,1.412,6.0546,2.0127,0.1052,1.8859,4.1451,0.0128,3.1582,4.5659,0.975,2.6132,2.0815,2.6417,5.1387,3.3803,1.1756,2.9866,0.6085,2.2298,5.1584,3.6445,2.4905,3.0016,1.3256,5.6641,0.2456,2.2742,2.0895,0.5527,2.7852,3.216,3.713,0.6165,2.3572,4.5634,4.7195,5.495,5.0261,2.7691,1.5053,1.1082,0.0002,5.464,3.7966,2.811,4.4301,2.1751,2.7905,4.2641,1.2184,0.9792,3.4583,2.7719,1.0869,3.3637,3.1897,1.0141,0.0363,1.0483,4.6809,5.6185,1.0902,3.3033,9.592,2.6898,2.4022,3.9382,2.3317,2.4764,2.2235,1.3264,4.1517,0.7666,6.229,1.3183,3.1396,0.4688,6.2927,6.3515,0.2408,1.4338,0.1813,1.5627,0.6741,0.6442,1.4036,1.3258,1.342,3.8581,1.3189,5.1663,0.1298,0.3182,1.5527,5.3891,6.29,0.4707,1.5988,3.7392,0.6403,0.7954,0.2309,1.3361,0.0002,1.5726,5.8309,0.2562,0.8088,2.5133,1.4931,2.1592,4.041,1.7788,0.6218,3.922,4.7778,0.8501,3.0737,4.5342,0.8144,2.129,1.9908,0.032,2.2316,1.3537,2.2854,1.2889,1.7885,2.0794,5.5924,3.9024,5.9036,0.4541,4.823,8.7228,0.5013,3.041,0.0002,1.5455,2.1435,0.1862,0.4953,4.5613,4.2964,2.4597,1.7692,5.202,2.1814,0.3209,0.6696,5.6609,5.6317,3.9975,3.164,2.4485,2.5158,2.4661,1.6719,1.5769,2.2629,4.5119,1.7968,0.0002,8.4982,0.062,0.9146,0.0001,6.6545,0.1795,1.3321,0.3678,0.0001,6.6889,0.2061,0.2516,0.0001,7.0921,1.8035,0.7201,18.7041,7.679,6.426,1.1738,0.0007,0.2954,0.0039,3.9182,7.8328,4.3779,3.0292,12.7071,7.1861,2.5284,4.5557,0.4692,0.1343]}

The test gave teams the opportunity to see the final prototype of the new 2.6 litre V12 engine developed by the company, which is the company's fourth engine made of nickel steel. It will be up to the end of the season to see if the new V12 can be used at the track ahead of the Spanish Grand Prix.\nIn addition, one of the teams, the Cirocchi team, will hold a three-day and five-day test of 3.6 litre V12 fuel. Starting 12-th of May, the car will use the V12 as the base power and the fuel injection will be replaced to match those used by the teams in the race at Monza.\nThe new 3.6 litre V12 engine will be supplied to the team by the company in order for the 2.6 litre engine to have a maximum effective consumption of 400,000 liters of fuel per second (MHS) that should be enough to satisfy performance needs for the team. A short time will be needed to work out the exact formula and when the V12 becomes available, the rest of the engines will be assembled.\nFollowing that, the teams will work hard to make sure the 2.6 litre engine is the suitable power source for the new F1 teams' Formula 1 cars and therefore, the development of a 3.6 litre V12 engine for the team needs to be carried out with the same energy level at the circuits that could potentially be used in a Formula 1 car.\nTeam Le Mans will host the 3.6 litre V12 engines race in Monza on April 30th at 12 noon, and at the end of the day, the first F1 team will race at Monza in the same format - on the day of the race against the Renault F1 team of the day.\nMore info\nThis article has been adapted from its original source.","token_len":422,"entropy":[4.0817,5.1847,3.0004,1.7957,1.7075,8.2033,9.9352,0.7407,4.5093,15.4935,8.1979,5.1453,7.7993,3.3836,2.9721,1.4472,5.7114,6.1184,0.0276,2.5898,1.415,1.4924,6.6807,0.0012,0.5962,6.8051,0.7699,0.0024,0.5991,2.1122,3.0411,6.0723,3.9357,1.9292,1.1338,0.0274,4.5358,1.9627,4.8026,6.4286,0.6519,0.6257,1.7285,5.9813,0.2331,3.7578,3.1444,0.0061,1.9051,1.1506,0.8242,5.1417,0.5003,2.6068,3.0201,2.3978,1.6267,1.7302,3.777,4.4306,0.0996,4.9192,1.875,6.4973,4.1954,8.4453,4.4721,0.5691,3.7419,2.1025,0.7705,5.9453,0.7509,0.9801,6.3681,0.4258,1.2677,1.8055,0.3499,2.2537,1.7272,0.8703,1.6012,2.0778,0.0972,1.3323,2.2672,2.4558,2.7996,0.8781,2.8903,5.374,0.0501,0.506,2.7374,0.3535,0.0003,0.5367,0.5973,12.2757,2.7289,1.3088,5.8869,0.7838,0.1338,1.6661,2.4214,2.5496,5.565,4.9803,6.119,5.8635,2.0851,0.3357,1.6901,4.5583,0.8497,4.4861,0.597,0.1682,6.2486,3.5048,0.2696,0.6164,1.5494,2.5502,6.4537,0.1637,2.6956,0.1924,0.1549,0.7176,0.061,6.2823,3.5813,6.3171,7.854,3.5514,4.9032,4.8838,0.7802,0.4591,0.7128,4.6802,0.4046,4.5941,1.5076,3.0118,0.1451,3.082,1.4415,3.8262,5.4262,4.2086,1.9683,3.6577,4.3008,1.2859,0.398,4.5934,5.5253,4.7518,6.1875,1.7981,1.529,0.5081,5.119,2.3442,0.7893,3.5906,3.4857,4.7506,0.0021,0.2608,0.8647,1.1981,3.2781,3.661,0.0097,0.0316,0.2296,0.0014,0.4397,0.0078,0.9713,1.4914,0.8072,5.5811,1.5795,0.702,1.7847,1.5037,1.6313,3.0665,2.5557,3.5724,3.7441,1.3278,6.0214,0.0235,0.1411,0.1999,0.0017,2.2489,0.1654,4.0299,1.168,3.5066,5.3822,8.0321,0.0556,5.2926,4.3326,0.0146,0.7543,0.8531,1.4275,1.1386,1.0921,2.6422,2.5928,3.6129,7.6931,1.6966,5.1601,4.6373,0.9349,1.7524,0.2075,4.192,6.3326,2.4301,1.4357,1.3346,2.9459,1.2313,4.6284,5.2882,1.4057,3.8431,1.0194,1.9359,0.6883,6.2792,0.2284,0.9953,3.5633,5.6278,2.6817,5.1129,1.0218,2.4003,0.0106,5.6439,0.7249,1.6342,1.0756,6.4017,0.2611,0.0995,3.9666,0.6298,0.3494,4.7854,1.7849,0.6055,4.9761,3.849,0.6617,0.4668,1.9743,0.2259,3.6597,6.2895,0.2771,2.8633,0.5572,1.1111,4.1647,0.0011,0.019,0.0703,0.0013,1.0458,1.2675,3.5501,7.6769,2.1804,2.531,0.253,0.4149,4.5391,5.2228,0.1779,5.5259,4.62,4.997,0.5139,1.3479,2.5957,5.1144,2.4344,1.5955,6.0151,0.6037,2.043,3.4911,0.0654,0.068,0.0768,0.0012,0.5264,0.0078,0.6509,2.3802,0.5115,2.7071,5.9829,0.1198,0.6112,2.7249,0.0248,3.7186,1.0845,3.7764,5.46,3.381,4.9492,0.8034,6.9958,3.0589,5.2821,5.0522,1.2778,0.4287,2.3599,2.8751,2.3991,0.1296,0.2082,0.4246,0.5432,5.0152,7.7892,0.2074,3.3999,4.1613,0.9462,2.7018,0.0041,0.0193,0.0446,0.0015,0.364,0.0046,5.1468,5.7688,1.6998,2.4549,0.0028,1.4449,4.8797,3.1092,1.9789,2.5488,3.0536,5.0455,2.3507,2.5852,3.6992,1.0293,2.0682,0.0058,0.6261,2.4992,2.4912,0.9041,4.027,4.8282,0.0103,1.0885,0.8895,3.7111,2.419,3.1021,0.0156,2.9036,1.3713,3.0845,2.6647,6.0231,4.458,1.185,3.4767,1.0211,0.2378,1.8623,6.55,0.6556,6.0661,2.317,0.1091,0.3931,4.4158,2.0538,3.9357,0.5695,0.8368,5.5643,2.9197,3.2256,4.3152,1.2899,3.1548,0.2071,5.021,0.1195,5.906,0.2562,2.4851,1.7143]}

{"id":1688,"ended":false,"length":380,"text":"In the 2002 \u2013 03 season, Fowler was transferred to Manchester City following a protracted transfer saga. Fowler initially turned down the move, and a dispute between Manchester City manager Kevin Keegan and the club became known as \"the saga\" after he publicly stated that they \"could not leave\" Fowler. It later emerged that a second time was also in place between the clubs.\n\nIn 2006 Fowler was transferred to Manchester City for an annual spending of \u00a32m. The City Football Programme has since been suspended and he was later suspended, but later returned to City for a sixth season, this time because of the financial implications.\n\nAfter leaving City for Manchester United in July 2005 he was then transferred to Brentford on loan from the North Americans in June 2009 for a further year.\n\nOn his return to Brentford he spent the following three seasons on loan with a third club, Stoke City, but a third season remained in place for him until 2009.\n\nOn 8 August 2010, he completed his first professional deal as a professional footballer with Brentford due to their relegation from the Premier Division. His first season with Brentford took place on 3 June, 2011. A few months later, on 9 July 2011, he moved to League Two, taking part in a 1\u20131 draw with Watford.\n\nOn 24 September 2010, as part of the transfer saga, an agreement was reached between Manchester United and the club, although this appears to have been a very minor one and therefore unlikely to have caused much uncertainty in negotiations.\n\nOn 15 September 2011, the City Football Programme suspended proceedings which had been going on for months and allowed the transfer to continue.\n\nOn 27 September 2012, Fowler arrived in the Premier League by the Manchester United board and joined Premier League club Aston Villa.\n\nOn 15 August 2014, he was made a First-team first-team player under former manager Eddie Howe as well as signing a two-year deal with the club.\n\nExternal links\nBrentford Football Programme\nMan United\nFootball Manager\nBrentford FC\nFootball World","token_len":423,"entropy":[2.6222,9.0361,8.7427,8.1194,2.067,0.5059,8.9949,1.6567,7.2835,0.3932,6.5747,1.9748,5.5262,1.2593,5.9036,2.3201,1.2864,0.9562,4.3661,5.9903,4.7666,0.1376,1.5797,2.2768,1.129,3.1273,4.831,6.6057,2.6729,3.1268,0.7499,3.069,6.2715,1.7285,0.0018,0.0656,1.8371,1.0042,6.2404,2.8349,0.4266,1.9222,2.328,6.4888,2.4455,2.0587,2.6389,4.0433,3.2378,0.8497,4.7649,3.7856,3.2836,0.5999,6.7392,2.3625,1.3758,1.0514,4.368,4.3307,0.9714,0.1123,3.6153,4.1801,4.0054,2.8761,3.685,3.3002,5.9667,2.4805,0.8716,1.5469,1.3854,0.6891,0.001,1.9098,2.9609,3.6589,1.3658,3.9743,0.2116,2.4839,0.7647,2.8093,3.3191,6.1842,9.4901,0.3562,0.3366,3.837,2.4627,0.9788,2.1508,6.3511,5.2736,8.8297,4.4793,1.745,2.1519,3.9823,2.2187,2.4653,1.5208,4.182,3.6883,4.9665,1.2682,6.9229,2.1571,0.1697,3.0921,1.3351,1.185,6.4387,0.2897,2.5422,3.3751,0.0439,5.5166,0.3883,2.7584,3.8842,5.4279,1.4521,0.7492,0.0002,3.9456,3.1572,1.1192,2.6854,2.4573,1.3165,1.056,4.5351,3.2729,3.8203,1.6133,5.0915,2.6302,0.1573,6.7275,0.0027,3.8657,0.9097,1.8287,2.8576,4.6689,7.7911,2.4752,2.2945,4.467,3.0418,1.2192,1.4542,3.4734,0.6009,1.596,0.0002,4.3321,3.1819,0.7018,0.4543,1.9252,0.0008,1.2832,3.7607,1.0682,1.8443,3.1581,0.2593,2.5816,0.1134,1.2273,4.1352,4.8735,1.3854,0.8253,5.7776,0.563,0.9288,2.9818,4.4414,3.9264,1.1778,7.1315,1.9146,1.5139,2.8485,2.2642,3.5021,3.7589,1.3665,0.7603,0.0001,3.3171,5.7943,2.1265,1.357,1.2644,1.6866,5.0072,0.6204,2.7169,4.2601,5.273,3.6333,0.504,3.2123,1.5597,1.6252,4.182,0.002,7.1729,0.0274,4.7699,2.2941,0.9564,0.1858,0.4032,5.1482,0.5358,4.323,1.5777,0.8966,1.6652,1.2428,0.0002,4.3384,1.1372,2.0453,3.6409,3.4283,3.2498,1.7937,1.0349,5.2733,4.0668,1.1289,0.0586,0.8899,2.6061,3.0613,1.8755,1.8743,0.319,0.7303,3.8139,0.2577,7.0229,1.2858,3.1342,4.0572,4.2839,0.0175,1.3772,3.9148,4.9749,1.3068,0.0107,0.7363,4.8078,0.0,0.7752,0.5809,0.0002,2.1925,4.2587,2.1671,2.3158,0.5486,5.2616,1.3409,0.0006,1.8575,2.9948,3.281,0.4914,5.7892,2.2587,0.2457,0.7894,1.034,2.9945,1.3278,0.1205,2.3842,1.7977,2.9078,5.1189,3.5997,7.4281,0.0943,0.0832,0.3662,2.8268,5.1557,3.0153,1.3128,3.2002,6.5575,5.4066,0.1222,1.1914,5.3138,2.6498,7.2969,2.1482,6.4805,0.4032,0.7782,0.0002,1.582,3.3388,2.2988,1.5225,0.3351,2.373,4.7234,0.6337,0.1812,1.9572,9.1165,5.8684,2.4513,0.8881,3.3246,0.0404,0.3427,3.4809,1.8588,4.1022,2.2055,1.9251,0.569,1.4156,0.6175,1.0897,0.0002,1.2439,3.6091,1.4566,2.5631,0.2911,1.5249,4.657,1.2703,1.9308,2.3445,0.0339,6.6087,2.9893,5.3563,0.9253,6.4397,2.0217,2.7969,5.4836,0.0031,1.9705,3.2903,0.0002,1.085,1.1072,0.0002,1.2952,3.5591,3.8106,2.0489,0.4085,1.4221,1.4341,4.2354,2.3283,6.6983,3.2922,0.2051,4.9926,0.3618,0.009,2.1277,4.7113,5.7287,1.6081,6.4918,0.0527,4.3431,2.549,0.0103,5.084,1.0398,2.6332,0.0544,0.0616,0.9479,0.863,1.7923,2.2975,0.4869,0.4797,0.0002,9.6091,0.6017,1.3223,19.1784,0.2638,0.0119,3.6545,1.9437,1.4315,21.5662,2.2742,2.1996,12.2351,2.8156,1.7769,13.4199,0.0335,0.0069,4.1698,0.6797,6.7648,6.8612]}
{"id":4555,"ended":true,"length":341,"text":"Since World War II, Japan's flag has been criticized for its association with the country's militaristic past. Similar objections have also been raised to the current national anthem of Japan, which contains a Nazi caricature, as well as an alleged symbol of the'saint' of the Second Intifada, the bloody battle of Wuhan in China's Hubei province that killed between 600,000 people and 200,000 others. The controversy over the flag's association with the'saint' has also spurred debate about the patriotism of this nation.\n\nThe country has suffered a number and major war-related casualties. Last year alone, Japan sustained two casualties from the 'attack', said Toi Kei, national security adviser to Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nOn the eve of the 20th anniversary of the'saint' incident at a school, the student student body held a mass to raise awareness about the Nazi-Gandhi alliance among the children.\n\nThe students are known as 'The Shinteki', due to their resemblance to the Shinteki and to that of the'saint' who was a member of the party of the Nazi Party and founder of the'saint' group, said Toi Kei.\n\nTao Lian, the leader of the Japanese Union Students Union, said the student student council has an important role in raising awareness about Nazi-Gandhi. He told a conference that 'today's youth are becoming aware of the history of fascism... We'll raise awareness about our nation,' said Tao.\n\nIt was the second time the school has raised awareness about Japanese-Gandhi. On the 19th of September 2017, students participated in the annual \"gidori\" (gymnastic festival) in Tokyo over the'saint' event.\n\nAccording to the organisers, a total of 1,000 students were involved.\n\nThe event, organized by the Nippon Wawa GigaOlympics Federation in collaboration with T-Kogyo Entertainment, was attended by 5,000 people.","token_len":423,"entropy":[8.5139,0.1257,0.3307,0.2607,4.6979,1.9513,8.3515,4.8735,0.8784,7.9568,0.7005,1.2665,5.2786,0.018,1.8412,6.1429,0.0462,2.9706,0.7171,1.7171,0.4818,7.7373,5.9376,0.7237,2.7594,0.3666,0.8193,3.4688,0.6322,5.3307,4.7831,1.2468,4.382,1.8692,1.0928,0.6955,6.1099,1.4569,4.9573,5.9852,2.9656,2.4141,0.49,0.0166,3.7868,4.6138,6.6068,0.0837,2.1282,14.0935,12.7921,7.9981,4.9681,1.9196,6.086,8.0939,0.0205,0.0015,1.8722,1.6346,5.8147,4.9344,1.441,5.9932,3.2153,0.0059,0.9145,5.4441,1.9258,3.9704,0.8476,0.0001,0.1561,3.4546,2.3208,5.0559,4.014,0.1835,0.0003,6.5551,0.2177,5.9899,0.0159,0.0021,5.3195,0.4086,3.2696,4.1638,1.7921,0.456,0.8716,1.6156,1.6285,0.1471,0.7915,12.7229,0.061,2.9947,1.6352,2.0865,4.5343,3.6149,1.3396,1.3015,5.4068,0.3185,6.818,1.7392,1.4575,0.5866,0.0017,2.3037,4.5694,2.4067,6.3941,2.0616,1.4471,9.9175,5.9429,5.6815,1.9317,0.1567,2.2305,2.3256,4.796,0.5607,3.6431,0.136,2.3328,6.3659,4.8677,5.0754,2.1851,1.4504,6.8281,7.405,3.3299,5.9461,5.5693,5.809,5.2917,1.815,0.3675,5.815,1.7742,1.5369,1.1001,2.3407,0.5973,2.1854,0.0062,0.4395,0.0015,0.424,1.2313,0.0003,3.7395,1.9999,3.4497,0.002,0.5438,5.7626,0.0418,0.0843,0.0323,0.2811,9.6094,0.061,0.5379,3.4794,4.323,2.9226,5.2349,2.9918,2.3997,4.8083,5.8703,3.2028,3.2022,0.3771,4.1988,4.4161,3.7861,0.3903,1.2873,0.4235,5.8905,2.7526,8.5814,3.8278,0.0941,4.9572,5.8229,1.2336,5.9282,2.5039,1.1854,0.0004,2.1725,2.952,4.0918,4.4689,0.8892,2.218,2.6647,5.9098,4.4649,3.8665,2.9322,6.3243,0.0502,0.543,4.4456,0.0526,0.6832,3.3936,0.5999,0.0627,4.2847,4.4675,6.149,0.4139,0.9489,9.8294,0.0351,1.3679,2.9229,4.3257,2.5822,0.996,0.0207,0.2957,5.8502,1.98,1.1618,2.7745,2.5043,3.1088,6.382,0.059,0.3212,10.7779,0.017,1.742,2.8269,1.9811,3.6194,1.0092,0.0096,0.2646,0.0012,0.3957,0.4303,0.0002,5.5406,3.9065,6.7168,1.9171,1.6154,2.3863,4.0809,0.0223,0.1973,6.3414,5.6206,4.9841,2.1009,0.683,1.2415,1.4485,2.6371,3.6424,5.6931,2.9849,5.2654,3.8659,0.1709,1.4138,3.8678,0.1752,0.7682,3.0923,1.3043,0.0643,0.0018,0.0119,1.8379,3.2671,3.4828,4.0787,4.0177,1.7981,4.5522,5.7356,0.8074,4.9128,1.4197,4.7806,2.0756,0.37,0.6166,3.1486,0.2272,3.4082,5.5306,3.4364,5.4693,4.0313,0.8563,1.4704,4.1901,3.7454,6.119,3.0287,3.0135,0.6189,0.2579,0.0003,5.2994,1.954,2.2734,2.5472,1.157,2.3438,3.5669,2.0132,3.3028,0.447,0.8149,5.0106,1.9858,0.3574,0.0012,0.0034,1.4034,2.0711,2.7144,3.9845,0.0132,1.1351,2.4468,5.2884,0.1657,3.2994,4.2071,0.0302,1.8288,3.7472,3.8267,7.0627,8.0766,4.4232,1.328,2.2397,6.6466,1.1219,2.4709,2.6446,0.2969,1.3405,2.5025,6.6564,0.7334,11.5906,0.0085,0.2906,4.2419,0.7547,0.8599,0.0003,3.7197,0.0027,1.3854,4.951,0.3759,4.0059,3.0254,0.0097,2.9853,0.1274,2.2412,0.9386,3.0224,2.3693,2.8379,1.0429,0.0002,1.8468,1.9883,2.6908,3.3647,0.1345,0.6425,5.342,1.7558,0.0036,6.3085,5.8907,6.0096,7.7168,8.3222,5.4547,1.0105,4.2761,2.8519,2.7086,0.0036,5.3244,4.3781,3.9563,5.4398,3.1732,7.4581,0.5837,1.6019,2.7159,0.0493,5.1707,0.2804,0.4682,1.582,0.8396]}

The earliest of these is the Karnak king list, dating to the reign of Thutmose III (d. 1776), which was compiled by Khattak II (d. 1805, the reign of his eldest son Ismail II of Jordan). An alternative title is Djedukai \u2013 Djedukai King \u2013 Djeduka, indicating the existence of Djedukai's father.\n\nIn addition, Djedka was the domain ruler of the M\u0101t\u0101rek, a region and kingdom of M\u0101t\u0101rek which became part of Jordan.

Johnson racked up an average of 212 @. @ 67 alls. \u2013 Chad Hickey (@chadhickeyB) August 9, 2020\n\nJohnson has started his career in the NFL, where he was also on-field with the Seahawks in their 2017 season. But now, he is set to follow in the footsteps of the great Hall of Footballers, who are behind Hall of Fame quarterback Tony Romo in rushing and quarterbacking career numbers.\n\nWith a projected 4.9-point PPG in his NFL career, Johnson will be the only quarterbacks to average an overall plus-plus yards per game \u2013 as long as he keeps his foot on the gas. With nearly two years left on his deal, he has become a long-term veteran who can help with the offense during the season.\n\nHe also comes back to Jacksonville, where the Jaguars (2-2) are ranked No. 4 in the NFL behind all 32 teams in points allowed per game. Johnson has also been a key cog in Jacksonville's offense, as he helped the Jaguars defeat Tennessee 23-10 in the AFC Championship Game on Thursday night.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars are ranked No. 4 in PPG, behind only Alabama and Texas in the league. The Jacksonville Jaguars are ranked No. 17 in the overall PPG, behind only Texas in the overall PPG. In both categories, Johnson is a proven leader who has turned into one of the game's most productive quarterbacks. Johnson finished the 2017 season with a passer rating that was the league's highest since the beginning of the 1992 season.\n\n\"He has always been the leader of our staff throughout this season. He's been on the front burner for a reason,\" Jaguars President of Football Operations Mike Mattingly said. \"He has all the attributes to be the leader of our entire organization, and we're pleased with his leadership of this team for the first time in a long time.

I love to do stuff that people love \u2014 the film was probably my favorite thing ever,\u201d she said. \u201cIt [film] helps me a lot by showing the beauty and beauty of my own work.\"\n\nCarter said \u201cIt's easy to get caught up in what some people think, and it's hard to really get the confidence to put on something.\u201d\n\nCarter is best known for her role on \"Boomerang,\" which will be released on June 23.\n\nRelated Articles Articles","token_len":424,"entropy":[2.7641,1.4987,0.228,3.481,3.706,6.7616,8.5441,1.9444,5.1028,2.8752,4.4516,1.6422,7.3323,2.8481,3.4918,6.0402,4.5636,0.6845,3.6888,3.6292,0.7702,2.0448,2.6222,6.3171,2.2161,2.2595,6.1415,2.6453,0.0042,2.853,2.9324,4.5675,5.5471,1.3878,0.617,4.9758,11.0493,3.7196,1.1051,1.5411,2.8748,5.2306,4.6277,0.5129,5.535,1.402,1.9941,1.515,2.7068,5.726,0.3277,1.6334,5.9208,0.6683,0.8591,0.0008,1.8484,2.3381,0.5818,6.0983,1.4273,4.7163,12.5858,6.7022,5.4899,2.2991,1.5435,1.4459,8.0,1.0654,2.6181,1.05,1.7635,3.7467,0.564,3.6872,4.8269,4.2034,0.6331,0.7289,3.1007,4.082,3.4299,0.9197,3.0605,1.8371,4.7375,0.912,2.8029,3.0206,2.4328,0.5684,0.0207,0.4443,2.5138,0.2028,0.7282,2.4868,1.6724,4.3956,5.0461,2.7467,0.1672,0.2297,1.7237,1.9958,1.7883,5.4817,0.4648,2.4097,2.4397,5.4105,1.1873,5.2657,2.8066,5.8295,6.3775,4.8994,1.8046,0.5157,1.2321,0.0002,5.2581,5.0003,7.0293,0.7628,0.2936,1.3874,4.6879,1.9082,0.7549,4.2763,2.1941,1.199,3.5828,3.9584,2.0987,1.9174,2.3983,2.5712,4.1176,0.7667,0.8815,4.8569,1.3966,4.3531,0.7034,2.625,1.1926,0.7215,4.0307,3.6189,0.1662,0.2387,4.3462,0.8008,2.0839,5.6978,6.0426,4.8625,4.3581,6.2175,4.6768,2.2223,0.9594,3.6673,5.317,0.9936,1.4692,1.3412,1.6611,3.35,2.3474,5.7113,2.5771,0.4433,4.2444,4.3721,3.1707,1.2069,5.3921,1.8265,1.2652,3.1209,4.3916,1.9087,2.0677,2.3619,5.9943,1.8785,1.8717,3.9969,1.7379,2.8442,3.4611,3.7783,1.9117,2.8478,1.3178,2.0024,1.9688,2.2451,5.4265,4.1622,0.8331,0.3413,0.4838,0.2008,0.9522,1.0023,3.7508,2.9079,0.1721,3.6144,0.5196,0.7947,0.8776,2.2463,5.4196,1.498,0.006,1.3379,0.2169,0.0002,2.6664,2.2188,0.611,3.3511,2.8554,5.1831,3.5136,0.3777,3.2516,5.8332,4.2553,5.1197,1.7004,7.5522,1.4359,4.7372,4.7904,1.7459,0.8984,0.4259,2.7444,4.9512,0.4738,1.6167,0.9917,2.1458,4.9274,2.8065,5.2877,3.7521,0.4313,2.4982,5.4079,5.6242,1.5559,13.3917,2.1878,2.4935,0.8413,1.7853,2.2078,2.3639,6.3323,1.2241,3.4791,2.3527,0.3442,0.461,1.7908,5.5905,0.0095,0.3087,0.0007,0.0021,0.0006,0.7935,12.9245,1.9668,0.5885,3.0634,0.0838,1.0016,0.0002,2.9338,5.6694,0.9112,0.3413,4.97,1.7338,1.1924,2.634,2.856,2.0281,0.9412,5.0869,1.6123,0.306,1.1193,3.6561,1.8887,1.2242,2.899,1.9577,1.1267,1.8892,0.4907,2.9703,2.9895,1.4601,3.0022,2.21,1.0074,2.8746,2.6891,1.3156,4.2106,1.5815,2.5798,1.9322,3.7963,4.1303,5.4016,6.117,5.5641,1.0682,0.9408,2.9994,1.8438,1.5971,6.3166,1.946,6.7911,0.5682,0.1084,6.3474,0.6137,2.437,8.0697,4.951,0.1787,5.8501,0.9148,4.66,0.1267,6.0572,4.1112,2.6958,6.1266,2.4545,4.3961,0.245,3.2466,2.8384,3.0823,1.9102,0.2485,0.0002,2.6587,1.4541,8.0289,0.0788,4.2368,0.6962,5.5856,0.3933,2.5082,2.2142,0.0358,0.1438,3.2995,5.5149,0.7,1.3742,2.9836,1.8511,2.0631,0.4547,2.2762,0.3583,3.7381,2.8683,3.7577,6.9624,1.0983,4.1878,3.4601,2.2977,2.6565,6.0807,0.7149,1.2354,0.0001,3.394,3.4269,4.8777,0.0212,0.1613,0.6734,0.742,2.6726,2.8076,3.8141,0.508,0.0087,0.0007,1.1335,1.2926,5.8687,0.9025,1.0333,1.4088,2.9975,3.5128,0.8563,1.519,0.0002,4.1831,3.131,8.4788]}
{"id":813,"ended":false,"length":381,"text":"As with the curriculum, there are no references to sports being played at Carre's before the 19th century. In 1835, the Marquis of Bristol allowed the school to use an acre in the school on the Thames between itself and the town of London (known as \"The Bridge\"). It is thought that, while being a small school, it kept its name, and was eventually established through \"A School of Excellence\".  During World War One, the school was closed and moved to the newly-opened North Hall at the rear of the building.\n\nAfter 20 year of service to the Church of England, University of Bristol, and the parish council, the building will be refurbished to modern and up-to-date use.\n\nHistorical significance\nIn the year 1835 as a parish council to the town of London, the school has been used as a boarding school for the English university students. In 1835 the site was designated a Grade II historic site.  In 1836 and 1838, in addition to the school, there were other schools to be known.  In 1866, the town was renamed the \"Church of England Parish Council\", and in 1868 the name \"Hobbing Heath\" was changed to \"Hobbing Heath\".\n\nThe Church of England Parish Council was the administrative unit for the parish as well as the parish council. It has an office at 17-9-1, although this appears to have been replaced by the present office when the church church was demolished in the early 20th century. In 1974, the parish council was given a council election to choose the new parish council and the church (then demolished) became the church.\n\nThere were eight church buildings which were demolished during the early 1970s, and the most notable property left on the list is the \"Cave and Library\", which was to host the school.  When it was sold to a London developer for \u00a31.2m in the late 1990s, the building was demolished for the purpose of refurbishing a smaller, more modest school.\n\nReferences","token_len":425,"entropy":[5.168,2.1427,10.6892,0.9056,2.737,0.9012,2.4706,5.5698,0.628,7.6452,6.9598,3.5361,2.3501,8.7574,6.6209,4.7005,6.5614,1.235,8.9138,0.2897,0.371,0.6939,3.4477,3.0921,4.2838,0.5401,1.6303,6.6292,0.1917,1.3612,6.9893,6.816,2.2364,4.3493,0.3071,2.3081,3.9086,7.8987,4.0025,1.2584,3.6136,6.4036,1.3034,7.2846,5.6878,10.5559,0.0732,1.215,4.4036,1.7629,4.5695,4.1505,5.4223,0.296,2.9313,2.0879,4.2355,1.111,3.2335,1.8774,3.3236,0.3807,4.3131,3.9606,5.4791,2.1847,4.116,1.1467,0.3992,1.4768,6.1391,1.7769,3.4083,2.4954,2.1177,2.3863,4.8454,5.6126,6.6073,5.2851,4.4309,5.2574,1.6603,6.2747,2.1122,8.358,11.8228,2.9746,0.0035,2.8934,0.3636,1.2327,1.5684,0.76,2.926,2.2398,4.2932,0.2564,1.8798,5.2694,2.1364,2.7349,6.1712,5.6716,3.4474,1.9129,6.7933,0.0843,0.3803,1.8563,0.6604,1.9027,0.0328,4.3982,6.2185,6.4873,3.6582,2.6719,3.3601,0.6043,5.1295,0.8514,0.3357,0.5619,8.0222,0.5715,2.8301,1.6671,1.3271,1.7889,6.3591,4.1311,1.0568,1.3149,3.5299,4.974,0.4471,4.3881,0.0036,1.9367,5.0271,5.5149,6.5004,0.6774,0.0833,0.023,0.004,6.9238,0.5301,1.6854,0.0004,6.2336,1.4055,4.6991,0.5979,17.9836,1.6784,5.2292,1.8347,3.4315,5.7489,2.2592,5.3494,2.2841,6.043,0.9431,3.922,0.4914,1.6668,0.1862,0.9743,2.5331,4.8051,1.1068,3.1108,1.2796,0.4179,5.4915,0.3012,1.127,2.2956,3.6802,6.796,1.6494,1.1609,2.345,1.1494,2.183,1.995,6.5874,0.6997,3.9041,2.6309,5.4729,2.4312,5.695,0.2985,1.3985,4.1011,2.0105,0.9191,1.5273,4.4614,0.647,2.3117,0.8461,4.9278,2.2581,0.1087,0.9554,2.2029,0.6744,2.1929,0.6774,3.0242,2.6925,3.863,0.8985,5.072,2.483,0.9311,1.3722,0.7849,6.395,0.5764,0.9241,3.9405,2.2006,1.9804,1.8778,3.0066,4.0133,0.184,0.658,6.4274,2.2158,2.2851,1.1416,1.4775,0.5123,2.1726,1.2148,5.3099,3.9746,5.4848,4.4878,5.0869,6.2463,0.7153,0.1614,1.3978,0.2472,0.7483,0.9904,0.1321,0.3419,1.6796,3.6609,1.2966,0.0002,1.7028,4.2046,0.1428,0.0204,3.0912,0.0814,1.7174,3.8419,7.3018,4.2871,2.0287,0.4638,2.7028,5.3662,1.0399,0.0282,0.7576,2.1157,0.4026,1.3238,2.2421,4.1128,4.0517,2.2254,1.7806,6.0676,4.8598,4.8896,2.7751,2.3822,1.7295,5.7307,3.4994,6.1811,0.2125,0.3253,0.3068,3.3625,0.7201,1.0649,5.8817,1.4124,5.8101,0.5691,2.7696,7.6979,0.7585,3.7148,0.6787,2.8522,1.8661,2.6295,0.0108,0.0601,0.1683,2.8397,5.3563,0.5902,0.6656,2.8764,0.3041,1.914,3.15,1.8205,6.3146,6.157,1.7306,4.4028,1.2359,1.7112,1.421,1.6979,3.3331,1.8526,3.5959,5.9538,5.0862,8.9165,0.3405,2.6527,0.7312,4.2225,2.1414,1.1034,0.0002,4.3956,2.0938,5.3975,4.5316,1.8698,4.5698,0.7462,3.0448,2.122,0.2285,3.6769,3.6985,0.1132,1.6504,1.8076,1.9775,4.2773,2.3812,8.5088,5.2549,3.2923,0.3058,5.5809,1.0502,0.4196,3.7643,4.0986,5.9763,4.3949,6.7108,2.4673,0.8729,0.8246,5.8223,5.4048,0.7172,3.7063,1.7055,1.6464,5.6126,2.0027,0.3008,3.9982,1.2195,2.9072,4.2152,2.7476,2.7506,0.5021,2.3903,0.4661,2.4605,1.0388,0.3871,4.0815,1.9465,1.6143,0.0163,0.211,0.8915,1.5262,0.5273,3.289,3.556,1.7322,3.1301,0.0782,3.67,0.304,3.7825,5.3639,3.425,2.2734,4.3649,2.9967,1.0135,1.0757,0.0002,5.3779]}
{"id":3405,"ended":false,"length":375,"text":"In addition to his military service as a mechanic, Allingham spent the vast majority of his professional life as an engineer. His employers included Thorns Car Body Makers, Vickers General Motors and Visceral, the latter of which he worked for until a much sooner date.\n\nIn 1971, Allingham, along with a colleague from Vickers, formed The Allingham Engineer Company as a \"franchise arm\" of Vickers Motor Company. The business started with a single engine, the 1.1 litre, single-cylinder C7. During these years the company also became a joint and independent business and was later amalgamated into the Vickers Motor Company.\n\nBeginning in 1972, Thorns Car Body Makers was renamed as Vickers Motor Company, but in 1984 its shares were not sold. In its first year in business there was no market for the motor company and was ultimately led away by a series of significant acquisitions of the company's entire operations. Ultimately, the Allingham Company was in bankruptcy and was purchased by its successor company, Vickers Motor Company Holding Co..\n\nIn 1984, the company was spun off into a privately owned subsidiary of General Motors, which later became GM Motor Company. Both companies later merged with General Motors.\n\nIn 1998, the Allingham Company acquired GM Motor Co. and merged with GM Motor Company Holding Group, creating a company which today is GM Motor Corporation. On this occasion, Chief Financial Officer John Kranach stated that he and Allingham \u201cnever met\u201d, but also explained of the importance of the merger that \u201cthe transaction is historic, both for the automotive industry and for the American consumer\".\n\nSince its formation in 1977, the Allingham Company has been a symbol of the American automotive industry.

A series of unsuccessful unsuccessful negotiations and further negotiations in the United States resulted in the cancellation of the yacht's sailboat trip.\n\nA year later, on 9 February 1946, the yacht returned to the US on 2 May 1946, but before it could take off, the vessel was involved in a major accident on a private beach in northern New Hampshire known as 'Nova Scotia'. During the incident the captain of the yacht was charged with careless endangerment and the yacht was forced to take over a dangerous anchorage.\n\nThe owner of the yacht was arrested by the US Navy and transported to the U.S. Navy on charges of endangerment and possession of explosives, charges which the U.S. government later found to be true.\n\nThe yacht was returned to the United States on 19 August 1948, and is presently on the Isle of Man, where it will remain in a museum along with the other stolen assets.","token_len":427,"entropy":[9.6903,4.727,4.0262,7.9947,3.477,0.9921,7.379,9.6412,8.5938,2.4953,0.8648,9.9634,1.946,6.0972,1.5103,4.8285,1.8793,0.4369,7.5444,4.2918,7.2529,3.3535,6.5427,4.7017,15.4149,6.8301,6.1218,6.9794,4.243,3.3798,0.3069,2.9226,0.5269,4.6112,8.3483,1.6745,2.1955,6.4772,0.0614,4.0806,1.4473,5.0691,1.9803,6.3874,0.1424,2.2031,5.4447,4.8044,0.6789,1.2979,1.0293,6.6441,2.6833,0.7924,5.8894,5.4136,1.2217,3.1886,2.1257,6.0656,3.0137,3.2406,1.8689,0.4245,0.7658,3.0402,2.3004,4.2381,6.2146,4.3426,5.1839,1.4746,4.1289,5.1465,3.3495,4.3014,2.3223,2.2704,0.5527,5.0511,4.252,2.8479,4.131,4.5812,9.5971,3.3948,2.5686,4.2163,1.9258,4.7056,2.5403,3.37,4.5766,2.3275,5.1945,2.4128,5.5356,2.1675,6.9059,4.4608,2.6305,2.6218,2.2419,5.9754,2.0543,6.3669,0.1103,1.8445,4.1848,0.6612,2.5117,3.1206,0.3342,1.7487,1.3131,0.0082,2.1798,3.5526,1.0907,4.7321,0.1047,1.6275,4.0542,2.548,3.5683,3.277,2.6377,1.0141,1.9171,1.777,4.7325,0.5001,0.2341,4.9507,1.93,3.0643,1.2465,0.6346,1.7188,0.0002,3.4426,3.7107,2.118,1.4799,0.3906,3.6621,4.6747,0.1358,3.4459,5.7741,2.1881,5.7693,3.409,6.693,0.3794,6.9841,1.9954,5.2429,1.1146,1.1752,4.6641,0.7409,0.6481,3.9923,5.199,4.1297,0.8226,2.3384,4.0367,1.9248,3.2512,0.0173,0.5902,0.8412,3.1672,0.7789,0.7991,0.2222,4.6665,3.7984,3.288,3.3006,3.1879,2.3099,5.3635,0.2924,2.4553,1.0269,3.6119,0.444,1.9839,2.6515,2.8561,1.9724,1.2035,1.1953,0.0002,5.6078,0.3348,3.8939,4.7601,0.1302,0.4892,2.1414,1.3668,2.5637,2.2937,1.8824,1.0637,2.5603,4.5877,4.7353,6.458,3.5419,1.0719,3.618,7.1632,0.0119,1.481,5.1582,1.611,1.0823,6.8669,5.3773,3.5825,2.9128,1.1618,3.148,0.4168,4.5139,2.4323,2.6585,0.0931,6.2686,2.8629,6.311,1.7639,1.9509,4.7071,5.8728,0.0017,6.1486,7.2454,1.9258,4.0795,5.0095,2.2919,3.5284,1.5322,2.3735,0.0414,2.6577,0.0199,0.5069,3.331,0.0359,0.4508,2.9847,1.8904,5.8849,1.7014,7.6779,1.922,0.6007,0.0002,3.6027,3.6747,0.3238,0.4717,1.3733,3.7908,3.4698,0.5354,0.0939,0.946,2.6082,4.1869,0.1097,1.0524,0.2373,2.8665,3.8821,1.8696,0.9528,1.0884,3.2695,4.7595,1.6597,0.4857,3.9155,0.1226,1.1002,1.3759,4.873,1.0513,6.1844,0.0302,0.4551,3.8537,2.3808,2.4724,2.9319,5.2418,3.3243,1.1605,5.5653,1.91,3.0022,6.7395,0.034,4.308,4.4884,5.5323,1.861,1.0578,4.8268,0.722,3.1174,2.4441,4.4685,1.0284,0.1121,0.8468,1.857,6.3797,0.181,5.0914,3.5548,0.0005,1.1803,2.8162,1.4326,0.6243,4.4777,0.1548,3.0887,4.6339,2.528,6.1957,7.0808,0.1796,1.3479,0.9441,0.0002,1.6201,5.0591,0.3509,0.1702,0.489,1.6936,4.1683,2.5719,0.7685,1.5856,1.1023,1.3208,5.7508,0.2008,1.5685,4.4039,0.0116,0.0386,0.1079,2.6266,5.0846,6.0401,0.1901,6.5286,0.0011,1.1095,4.1497,0.069,3.7949,2.3934,5.5301,0.9271,2.7288,3.2195,0.0009,0.0026,0.0072,2.0924,2.0819,3.5473,0.7323,0.1132,4.0164,0.3328,0.988,0.0002,1.6328,1.9551,0.7269,2.7965,0.073,0.4843,2.0963,0.0158,0.4846,3.5916,2.4477,2.9237,0.9184,1.2137,3.8173,4.8773,2.3403,2.003,5.3483,0.054,0.4944,1.5286,1.8516,0.4318,2.8306,1.8232,2.6244,2.8101,1.9703,6.3233,0.089,1.5046,2.1923,4.9091,6.4039,0.9729]}

{"id":4489,"ended":true,"length":403,"text":"Ste Pickford developed the gameplay map for Ironsword. According to him, he basically copied the map that was used in a conversion port of Ghosts'n Goblins that he developed a couple of times back on the PS4 itself. Although, he has a theory about why the game was developed such that it will always be a stand alone product. It will be released later in the year through Activision. But now, they have confirmed that this game will be available for all PS4 console. And after a lot of hype, that means, it will finally make sense for Bungie to finally support this popular shooter and help it in some form. That means, Destiny and Destiny 2.\n\nFor now, if you had to pick from the four DLC maps, Ironsword. In its usual form, it is not as good as Ghosts, but it has become a nice addition to the Xbox Series X\/SC. Of course, it is always a fun game but I don't think Sony is going to drop any money in that game. It will also help the game more than ever. The developers have been offering more than enough DLC with this game. As for Forsaken or Destiny 2, I have not seen any reports that they are coming up on a deal with Bungie. It is still possible that Bungie will just want them up, but it is likely as long as they make it worth the wait.\n\nAt the moment, Ironsword. Yes, you can already pick out the game. If you want to download this game, I highly recommend it.

{"id":2207,"ended":false,"length":404,"text":"During the 1920s and 1930s many skyscrapers were designed in an Art Deco style. This architectural approach typically combined what Carol Willis terms an `` aesthetic of simple, sculptural mass `` with the power of imagination.'' The building was designed as an urban space for the local community and its architectural history reflected such values as, while they made use of an experimental method, it was still open to their tastes. It was now a landmark on the city skyline and the building was home to many local businesses.\n\nIn 1946, the New York Times reported that the work of artists William Smith and Elizabeth Smith, who had originally designed the New York Street and Broadway buildings, had been completed as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation of the Hudson River. The streetlight that had earlier served as visible light was replaced by a water fountain to match those of the streetlight. A mural at the back of the building was transformed into a sculpture by a group of artists.\n\nIn October 1947, the New York City Public Art Museum and its artist's residency program were both closed, which would have been followed by the closing of the art museums and the National Gallery of Art in New York City. However, in February 1957, the Museum of Modern Art opened in the old building on Fifth Avenue, which was later renamed to the New York State Street Museum. The Museum of Modern Art in Los Angeles opened in early 1959.\n\nIn 1960, the New York City Arts Council named the New York City Public Library its \"largest and most notable public library''.

{"id":2812,"ended":true,"length":403,"text":"Inbreeding tends to occur in flocks of limited size and where only a single or a few rams are used. Associated with inbreeding is a decline in progeny performance usually referred to as inbreeding. The average male female is between 50 and 65 years of age and can be produced up to the age of 70, usually on males. Females have an average lifespan of less than 20 years and can be produced up to the age of 70. Although this male can reproduce on up to 24 male rams, females are sometimes able to reproduce on multiple males in the same flock. At the height of the female female and male range, female females are nearly twice as likely to produce two or more more male rams if they had all of the male females tested as the average male and female.\n\nMost female females are not as susceptible to inbreeding as male rams and are at a far lower risk of inbreeding than males. However, in the majority of times where male rams are the more rare and dominant ones in most areas, both populations have an even higher risk of mating in mating sites than male rams.\n\nWhat to do if you think you have or suspect you have an inbreeding problem and would like to discuss it with your friend, family, colleague or family support worker\n\nIf you want to talk, feel free to drop me a pm or email. I appreciate their interest and would be happy to provide you with the answers to any questions that you could have. If you think that your friend or family member has an inbreeding problem but also has advice to share, please drop me a reply e-mailing your enquiry or comment below (or alternatively post the same or more questions on my website). Hope that works for you.\n\nThank you so much for your email and my congratulations on reaching your first step towards getting your own family!

{"id":2372,"ended":true,"length":399,"text":"At the time of his death, Kennedy was substantially behind Humphrey in convention delegate support, but many believe that Kennedy would have ultimately secured the nomination following his victory in the California primary, and not on the merits.\n\nJohn Paul McEntee Jr., an attorney, has written about the process, and argued that the Republican nomination of Kennedy would be incomplete if he was only a \"fringe delegate\".\n\nKennedy did not seek the nomination, though not against the GOP, because he believes that if he did, he would have won the election anyway. John Paul McEntee Jr and John Paul M. McEntee both won the California primary as independents. Kennedy was not an extreme extreme, but rather a moderate moderate who had supported Bush and not the Democrats in Congress as much as he was. He did not support Hillary Clinton at the time, but after that, the party was not a \"major party\", but rather a more progressive party that did support Clinton. He did not support Bush in 2004 or 2008 both times, but would have been more extreme in 2004 if Clinton won the general election that followed.\n\nKennedy had been a major contributor to party unity for years. He had also supported the anti-war movement, particularly in Texas and Mississippi. He made his peace with the war criminals, but he supported many Republican politicians who did not want to make their country home.\n\nJohn Paul McEntee Jr. is a professor of law at Harvard and the University of Pittsburgh. He is the author of \"The War on Terror: The Threat to Our Country\" and the forthcoming book \"Conflict On the Border-line\". His work focuses on the effects of the war on American citizens.

When the British landed on it they removed most of the rail and replaced it, the rest of the rail, along with a small number of other pieces, including the submarine rail, as well as the bridge, train hall, and some of the wooden seats on the island.  The bridge has since been replaced, and the wooden seats on the island still make up 20% of its size, but because the railway isn't built of steel it can only be restored by a replacement.\n\nThe island of Halmahera is the home of The Rock in the Philippines.  The rock is on the island to the north of its southernmost part, on the island of Manus, which is just north of the Philippines island.\n\nAccording to the History of The Rock in the Philippines by Dr. Anthony Johnson in 1959, it is the birthplace of the rock guitar.\n\nThe rock was laid down by John F. Tompkins in 1904 and began using steel for building their own bridge.  John F. Tompkins was a famous guitarist, as was Lanny Smith (also known as \"Rock Guitar\"), but he was also famous for having written the lyrics to an instrumental guitar tune originally written for the popular hit song \"Manus\".  John F. Tompkins also wrote other instrumental lyrics of the rock band, including \"Manus Rock\" of the band The Dead Keys. John C. C. C. and Lanny Smith, who served in the United States Army from 1933 to 1937 in Okinawa, Okinawa and Bataan respectively, provided the songwriters with their inspiration for their instrumental version of \"Manus Rock\".\n\nThe Rock guitarist Lanny Smith played a major role in the band's musical score.\n\nSee also\n List of rock guitar bands\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n The Rock in the Philippines at Wikipedia","token_len":429,"entropy":[10.9897,10.855,7.2483,6.6087,5.7364,0.4951,3.8296,15.3436,2.0056,4.8779,0.9167,3.1307,13.5764,4.152,3.7644,16.8779,6.8151,9.617,9.4024,8.1922,10.0261,5.5081,4.7028,2.1548,4.6595,1.6456,5.6767,9.5758,0.6734,3.6098,1.9068,1.8026,10.5474,0.1941,1.2704,4.9023,1.0493,7.8351,5.0618,7.7091,0.2831,2.738,4.7661,1.7927,0.4231,7.4989,9.6568,1.8126,8.5011,4.2444,1.3467,5.0762,3.2713,4.9736,3.6988,0.0947,0.5724,4.9204,1.8424,2.2001,0.1801,7.3145,4.5319,3.5463,1.9489,0.6065,2.7648,2.9782,4.473,0.0156,2.5995,2.4019,2.278,0.0203,2.7871,4.236,1.0488,4.5515,1.1507,6.6647,1.5362,0.9079,5.1701,1.9819,0.012,1.0421,5.589,2.8426,5.852,6.5479,0.2757,0.8995,5.4056,1.9807,0.1528,4.8256,5.0277,2.8086,0.4475,3.0933,0.5116,1.9573,1.3274,4.6116,3.5866,4.3628,0.2774,1.4531,2.4024,1.4682,1.1992,4.9865,0.5101,2.0461,0.2398,0.1831,5.0477,5.0761,1.6178,7.3539,0.4265,0.0241,3.4073,4.3201,2.7026,1.568,6.0954,1.5629,3.3538,5.8211,0.0006,3.1996,3.7336,1.8488,2.8581,2.1451,3.2757,0.8024,5.3493,1.9783,2.8573,5.796,2.1098,2.3243,0.0907,1.7718,2.5707,1.577,0.0778,0.0016,0.0003,0.001,0.9636,2.722,3.1421,0.2281,4.9341,5.3836,4.3759,1.3201,7.5128,1.1235,1.4798,1.1582,2.1886,1.1904,5.6301,0.7479,1.4261,4.8114,1.1686,1.5579,0.9491,3.9641,4.4102,3.2378,4.6718,0.8048,3.9573,0.4341,2.1393,0.9542,5.7889,3.262,1.7928,2.1864,0.7766,4.0724,2.1582,0.0244,0.7492,6.3248,4.6863,1.1329,2.6309,0.0002,5.7443,0.0029,1.3875,6.5637,0.3213,3.3367,0.5592,1.6861,0.3619,0.0431,4.2338,4.2431,0.3621,6.1472,6.0568,3.9975,5.2641,0.4252,3.6773,0.9404,1.882,4.0966,0.0409,1.2137,3.1524,6.8809,1.3258,1.9832,0.0002,1.3741,1.8613,2.5077,7.6831,0.8765,1.2612,3.9674,4.6283,0.494,5.2739,3.0166,0.011,0.9801,5.2965,2.1671,5.7125,4.4266,5.9645,2.4491,5.4537,3.557,2.9777,4.6443,1.7251,1.7024,5.01,0.7221,0.0249,0.1421,0.0003,0.0069,1.8416,1.2996,4.3861,2.8718,2.053,4.9179,2.2155,6.1313,5.0848,4.3324,3.2343,3.9082,0.3454,0.0309,2.4426,5.3899,4.7458,1.9448,3.6219,1.8404,1.1831,1.2586,4.215,0.2122,3.0611,4.8216,1.8171,3.2757,1.09,5.4059,4.5779,5.509,5.1486,7.9009,1.7541,0.8333,1.0084,4.7839,4.6316,1.9376,0.8505,6.7256,1.8268,1.2673,0.9435,3.4613,0.164,0.0064,0.0424,0.0004,0.0031,2.4604,1.8191,5.0087,3.5049,5.4555,4.7579,1.3121,0.5722,3.555,1.6226,1.4796,1.1834,3.2706,0.0462,5.1178,1.6264,6.2328,0.8409,3.3508,3.4665,5.4532,7.6598,0.8177,4.3806,6.9108,0.1839,4.1359,2.0712,2.916,2.4956,3.8131,2.303,0.1476,0.0972,3.3366,1.8264,6.6636,3.0196,0.2818,2.594,0.0171,1.0308,2.5888,5.2095,0.5752,3.4956,4.9351,5.8752,0.3041,2.1667,2.9611,4.942,2.672,0.0112,6.2098,0.1028,6.5084,1.1919,4.2811,5.3283,0.386,2.8573,3.0775,0.7972,1.9257,6.502,4.6581,0.3859,1.1097,0.2102,0.0047,0.4181,0.6081,1.2946,0.0002,1.3091,2.058,5.4764,3.0484,0.0691,0.0265,3.4823,2.7248,3.2738,0.1559,0.094,0.7328,4.1556,0.6184,4.7489,7.0031,1.5906,1.7074,0.0002,6.0085,0.36,1.2864,22.4247,0.0524,3.9029,1.6744,4.8778,2.1046,0.0003,1.6957,1.8783,0.0006,3.2752,0.3072,0.9205,0.0003,3.84,0.2397,1.4529,13.9293,0.5897,2.4555,0.1563,0.0314,6.7305,1.4236]}
{"id":1486,"ended":false,"length":406,"text":"In the early seventies, the capabilities of AI programs were limited. Even the most impressive could only handle trivial versions of the problems they were supposed to solve ; all the programs were either superlative or were very low-performing, with a much lower end \"power-level\" of the usual, while they made use of a wide spectrum of human intelligence.\n\nSo it was interesting to see what they were able to do compared to what the program itself failed to solve. For example, they could only use programs from the \"best\" versions of our scientific knowledge and theories, but could never use new and better ones. That means they were only able to solve problem after problem, which was more difficult than it must seem.\n\nThe problem was not only a technical problem as much as a problem as a person : the programmers were at the very least at a disadvantage, the computer was not a \"brain\" yet.\n\nThat said, I don't think the program itself is that powerful in most areas, and I think there may have been more than one problem that was not addressed.\n\n\"What if something was impossible because of bad or good physics? Where have you seen this before?\" asks the author (Cox, 2007).\n\nSo what if that wasn't possible because of bad or good physics? Where have you seen this before?\n\nBecause it was impossible. If it were possible, the programming ability to do that was very high. If it weren't possible, the programming ability to solve that was far lower, only around 0.0% of the problem.\n\n\"Why are you so obsessed with proving that a program can be found by the right combination of random access and computational power?

Broccoli on the sets of For Your Eyes Only because his first wife, Cassandra Harris, starred as Countess Lisl von Schlaf, mistress to the super villain, The Incredible Hulk.\n\nIn addition to leading into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Broccoli, James' wife, has worked with other prominent directors including, George Lucas, Tim Burton, Leonardo DiCaprio, John Hughes, David Fincher, David Lynch and Michael Keaton.\n\nBut, if you're going to shoot films and make them for a living and you don't have the funds, you need a way to live within your budget. Broccoli told Deadline that he had an idea when he got home from a break in the United States because his dream film producer who was also Broccoli's first wife, died from breast cancer back in 2012 at a Beverly Hills hospital.\n\nBrosnan was the first actress to produce a movie with a female lead, which is why he went after the lead role of a woman. The result is \"We Were Never Together\", an Oscar nominated movie that he directed in 2006.\n\nWith Broccoli having only one female lead, and working for a TV company and he was the second female director to produce one movie, one of his early attempts at breaking into the movie industry was in 2007 with \"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\", directed by James Bond, starring Jennifer Jason Leigh, Daniel Craig and James Bond.\n\nBefore becoming known as \u201cThe Sexist King,\u201d Broccoli also produced several films with female cast members like Idris Elba and Ben-Hur actor Nia Farai.\n\nThe man who went on to earn $100 billion dollars is known for his roles in many popular films including \"Avengers: Infinity War\", \"The Empire Strikes Back\", \"Red alert\", \"Hulk\", \"Boots on the ground\", \"Green Book\", \"Bombshell \", \"Spider-Man\" and his most recent project is now a hit movie called \"Green Lantern: The First Class.\"","token_len":429,"entropy":[9.3194,4.5081,8.1389,3.4567,6.5053,5.2556,7.5975,8.1005,7.2234,5.0376,1.0426,5.5329,0.9079,3.6672,1.3664,6.0977,0.0341,8.3383,2.1879,0.3509,0.0124,5.9498,4.1585,4.109,3.3888,0.9269,8.8915,7.2956,0.2091,6.3688,2.1675,8.2117,1.1257,4.6069,10.27,8.5333,7.2081,3.0356,4.9308,6.0865,2.6012,1.5116,6.4504,3.2089,3.1832,3.8044,6.2953,0.3527,0.2696,1.8392,0.0004,2.7424,3.9222,0.1672,6.5599,7.144,0.9396,6.0749,0.5155,0.0012,0.0001,0.3129,0.275,0.0,3.7491,6.3658,6.0771,1.5831,1.2615,2.9782,2.5201,1.595,4.2332,3.6139,2.3588,1.7846,6.0439,4.5913,1.0218,0.335,5.5644,0.0355,0.2916,5.6473,0.0148,0.0109,0.0,0.3308,3.8987,3.0927,0.2728,4.122,2.27,0.0279,0.0003,0.2798,4.0535,3.2539,1.5804,4.0123,3.2457,0.001,0.4747,0.6575,0.0003,5.3088,3.6165,5.348,1.8148,1.2742,4.2249,0.0762,6.4172,5.2164,3.7152,3.0287,1.6245,2.9273,2.136,0.5564,3.9274,2.4939,2.8871,0.0004,1.5497,1.6198,4.0575,1.2866,1.0998,2.5945,1.7326,4.0386,0.1227,5.0863,5.8561,1.012,2.8379,0.4402,3.0093,0.0001,3.6874,3.6984,0.8793,1.2102,3.1235,3.8118,0.2161,3.2435,0.3108,2.9389,4.3554,0.6306,2.2421,4.492,2.0763,1.9658,4.3339,0.1352,6.2083,2.4888,5.722,5.6034,5.1721,7.0437,1.9019,3.1775,6.1356,0.0002,0.3649,4.4183,0.2055,0.8033,6.0909,4.06,3.9816,0.0018,5.8825,0.067,3.2112,4.2364,4.4531,4.4984,0.0356,0.7535,0.2327,0.3658,0.0002,4.378,0.084,0.001,3.082,3.6872,1.7947,5.7206,0.5064,6.501,1.2255,2.9693,2.2035,1.9236,3.8849,0.2888,1.1962,3.6188,2.3654,1.9688,0.863,4.5631,4.3657,1.8286,3.306,1.5691,0.6327,4.1121,3.8003,2.2936,3.1766,4.2247,1.3628,3.1591,4.6695,3.852,3.0347,3.7722,3.8545,2.9082,3.7129,2.9368,3.175,1.5085,4.4341,2.5123,3.0544,3.6557,0.7213,0.469,0.0002,4.9608,2.6228,0.0001,4.6402,5.4493,2.8148,3.9288,1.0281,1.3414,3.1981,4.9623,3.4225,1.4917,6.3616,4.8199,3.1132,5.5914,4.6713,3.6972,4.4857,3.0139,1.8224,1.0849,2.7159,3.7932,2.5813,1.1193,5.269,1.0418,2.1913,5.2207,3.9594,0.564,6.3565,0.9236,0.7472,3.2151,1.9715,1.7008,2.9773,2.7793,1.357,2.0446,4.1573,3.6504,4.0708,0.9959,2.2366,7.3415,1.4902,3.2065,0.0139,4.435,1.5311,2.7376,2.3213,4.3864,3.9585,0.003,2.146,5.7077,0.1233,0.9846,3.5425,0.9097,0.541,0.3883,0.0002,5.8549,4.8677,4.5784,0.7087,16.1988,6.0315,3.2183,6.675,4.4082,6.9122,2.8307,3.4625,7.7218,0.5543,0.0002,2.7811,3.5872,3.5066,1.331,1.5598,2.6432,5.6179,0.2058,3.7976,5.793,0.1914,0.0,0.0,1.4077,6.2296,6.8959,0.1094,8.096,5.5823,2.0854,6.7004,5.5459,0.5795,0.6285,0.0002,3.1154,5.6089,1.0564,5.3729,1.7725,0.0177,5.2639,2.7685,2.7831,4.6979,2.9967,3.2702,3.4977,0.5171,0.6506,3.9062,0.3608,3.35,3.5706,1.4,1.2901,0.6284,4.091,3.5307,0.0043,0.6685,3.8863,0.003,0.8457,0.1882,1.7967,6.3056,0.0019,0.0009,0.4559,0.1017,6.1129,10.4699,0.3851,0.1227,4.7403,3.622,2.0246,0.1289,4.3612,5.5204,1.6878,0.1318,6.6154,0.4603,0.1504,6.2103,8.751,0.5869,0.1039,4.3022,4.3876,0.2201,8.4411,0.1364,5.7874,0.1676,0.0401,3.4862,0.1455,4.3305,3.7143,0.1776,3.8368,2.2164,5.6548,2.9699,4.4385,2.4417,2.7751,0.2614,6.4217,1.2269,1.63,1.5484,4.9045,4.643,2.7624]}
{"id":574,"ended":true,"length":389,"text":"After graduating from McMaster, Innis felt that his Christian principles compelled him to enlist in the Canadian Expeditionary Force. He was sent to France in the fall of 1916 to fight in the French-backed campaign against the German-Soviet War. In a month's service, he was captured and taken by the Germans while they made two attempts to capture him, including one of which was unsuccessful. \"I was shot at every step, I did every thing. It was unbearable not to be able to speak.\"\n\nReturning home from France in October 1919, Innis returned into service to the French army and, along with his fellow soldiers, was elected president of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. He had been placed in command of the unit that had been under attack during and after the Battle of the Somme. Despite this, he continued to make sacrifices at home and, after a bitter battle with the French army led by General Charles Fournier on October 13th 1919, was posted to England by Colonel Edmund L. Gage, commanding a French squadron in the northern part of Britain. The regiment was promoted to insignia shortly before the war ended.\n\nNis had joined his British comrades, some 150 French troops in the Battle of the Somme, in February 1922, to take on British troops in the English Channel, captured while they were attempting to take out the German-Indian forces. In December 1922, he was transferred to the Canadian Pacific Air Force.\n\nNis and Lieutenant General Arthur Schlesinger (pictured above)\n\nNis also became head of the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the Battle of the Somme and participated in the Battle of the Suez Canal. He was also a key in the Battle of the Barents and the Battle of the Pyrenees.\n\nHe had also been a keen observer of many naval battles. He was the commanding officer of the Royal Canadian Airforce (RCAF). In addition to his service as a senior officer, he was also an officer for the Royal Canadian Air Force, which is a branch of the Royal Canadian Navy that includes his wife Elizabeth.","token_len":430,"entropy":[10.8254,0.6726,8.1468,1.5472,12.2956,1.7244,7.2917,2.0463,2.3178,9.1818,4.5999,7.5854,0.0391,0.0206,7.1123,0.2905,0.4146,4.225,7.6918,0.0569,0.1243,0.9533,1.5557,1.8497,3.4727,0.4353,4.384,1.6587,3.5049,3.0578,0.0261,2.8997,2.1245,2.5111,0.9664,0.6433,2.4129,4.0878,3.879,3.6438,0.385,0.4578,2.2936,3.6914,3.8517,4.8492,0.3714,2.5855,4.1057,6.5166,1.7176,5.4102,0.5939,0.3465,1.3887,4.0527,1.2148,2.197,4.1613,0.7859,2.3236,3.7883,3.1553,5.1588,5.699,2.9158,0.309,1.5652,0.4654,2.5767,4.7726,1.5111,3.4529,2.8375,1.0763,2.4513,0.2063,4.773,1.1459,1.4849,5.8739,3.1255,4.0124,2.4165,3.1207,3.2395,5.5779,5.5849,1.9171,4.3151,2.9235,0.3793,6.7208,7.2957,0.3583,1.3514,1.1243,0.0029,3.4487,4.4229,1.0492,0.0008,7.4345,0.4792,1.4528,2.553,1.9344,2.4509,3.3301,3.9217,0.1286,0.6328,0.0002,2.9065,7.363,3.6713,2.8663,1.1649,4.3624,2.6328,2.2959,2.9632,4.0617,0.0058,1.2484,2.0405,1.2631,0.1618,2.1022,5.3985,3.6114,0.2194,0.2031,2.7764,1.3108,0.0042,0.06,0.6962,1.6049,3.4335,1.623,5.6874,1.1129,1.8875,0.1905,1.0493,5.6399,2.8849,1.5182,1.2377,4.2436,1.081,4.0511,7.3196,0.4404,0.253,1.8713,0.0023,2.4666,0.8656,0.0,1.0626,5.0469,2.649,0.9742,0.7881,3.7065,0.2436,4.5117,4.1113,4.3405,1.7449,1.1179,4.1315,2.5109,2.4952,4.3476,1.4403,1.1681,0.9292,2.0924,3.4504,7.2162,0.4009,1.2259,3.9112,4.7757,3.7271,0.006,4.1124,2.745,3.3988,2.4904,3.2572,0.0499,2.4647,7.0075,0.3814,5.5357,5.1513,3.9613,6.4241,4.7625,1.5693,4.9408,3.2748,1.9377,3.7207,2.6865,3.1013,4.1566,2.6547,1.0382,5.1593,0.8932,0.0017,3.8865,0.3048,2.9483,3.6198,1.1285,6.1234,0.2628,6.7989,0.0307,6.2896,2.3116,0.6112,2.2734,1.5993,1.0645,0.5995,0.0002,4.3433,2.6466,6.6558,5.1753,3.1213,4.7219,1.705,3.2609,5.2815,8.006,4.0467,2.9392,2.72,1.1457,4.7843,0.0055,1.5133,0.0481,0.0025,0.8956,1.8521,4.0591,3.7879,1.6356,3.4949,2.8144,3.466,3.7866,1.8331,1.02,0.7747,5.4534,1.2838,2.5485,7.3121,6.3034,2.8592,0.1838,3.3451,0.0626,2.8655,3.0226,0.834,2.5107,2.0265,4.9883,4.3033,2.0217,2.754,4.1915,0.9088,0.1944,1.2821,1.0127,3.186,0.1639,0.9046,2.6429,7.3234,4.5794,0.8112,1.8572,1.6801,0.0001,2.1855,0.0068,3.8692,5.4618,1.8792,5.2853,6.184,2.5623,0.0174,3.4956,3.9603,1.5902,0.6537,4.4695,0.0001,1.8821,0.0064,4.9372,3.4548,6.2722,0.0845,0.4055,0.8843,0.4098,0.0037,0.0389,2.9965,0.5337,2.2862,0.0152,0.811,0.0597,0.003,2.5419,4.749,0.0927,0.8039,2.2418,0.0138,1.4008,5.9215,1.3152,0.0841,1.2057,1.2247,0.9457,2.4843,2.032,3.1743,5.129,1.0705,4.412,0.0187,1.3169,4.4096,3.1905,0.0009,4.3251,1.7088,1.3466,0.0075,1.3239,5.9397,0.034,0.0001,0.8092,1.5206,0.0001,2.7377,3.164,2.5957,1.4075,1.8877,6.3447,1.1116,0.1096,6.7806,7.6634,1.2192,1.8997,1.6134,1.1419,2.6954,3.7188,0.1269,0.1269,0.7801,2.6903,1.0571,3.8555,5.078,3.5027,0.664,0.5724,2.5423,2.3635,3.3981,0.3705,1.3068,2.8862,1.4857,1.233,5.6055,0.71,0.7805,0.3539,0.9073,0.7719,2.5239,1.3019,4.1352,0.8582,0.963,0.4413,1.8296,0.2263,1.9993,2.3789,3.7995,2.4253,2.9253,0.0241,0.2187,0.7086,0.1596,0.5161,4.2246,3.326,5.5078,2.9885,5.0735,1.2144]}

Preterm ultrasound may be performed on more than one occasion in order to provide more accurate and timely prenatal ultrasound. At this time, if there is a need for an early prenatal prenatal ultrasound and there is no need for a late pregnancy ultrasound, the preterm or early postpartum ultrasound, which may take anywhere from 5 days to 24 hours, may be performed without the support and care of a midwife.\n\nIf there is a need for an early prenatal prenatal ultrasound and there is no need for a late pregnancy ultrasound, the preterm or late postpartum ultrasound, which may take anywhere from 5 days to 24 hours, may be performed without the support and care of a midwife.\n\nDepending on the nature of both the early fetal and early postpartum ultrasound, or the ability to obtain a preterm pregnancy ultrasound during the early labor and delivery phases, a normal preterm ultrasound may be performed for a first time.\n\nPregnancy can be conducted within six to eight hours. If the procedure is performed on children with a preterm pregnancy ultrasound, an additional nine hours of ultrasound time may be used.

{"id":4994,"ended":true,"length":390,"text":"Wilberforce was deeply conservative when it came to challenges to the existing political and social order. He advocated change in society through Christianity and improvement in morals, education and religion, fearing and trusting that the future would be better for mankind.\n\nThe Founding Fathers who wrote the Constitution and ratified Articles 3, 4, 5, and 6, saw in Wilberforce the need for an army of Christians capable of being involved in any new war. These Christians gave up all hope of military operations to serve their country, and they did nothing to win the war.\n\nThis is one of the reasons Wilberforce chose to give up on seeking civil war. He only wanted to lose one-thousand of his troops. The war that Wilberforce fought in was because men of strength had surrendered. Wilberforce saw it as a betrayal of the people of the country who would have won the war with the military strength of soldiers.\n\nHe also believed that the people of Wilberforce would choose that nation in which they had fought a war which would have been more peaceful in their minds. He chose to follow that trend, with the exception of South Carolina, where he joined only a few troops. Then, he joined the United States Marines in the Mexican-American Revolution.\n\nWilberforce believed that this battle, which he believed in as well as the others, would make their country stronger and more united. He wanted to make this battle a fact that all those fighting on this ground would be rewarded by a few hundred American soldiers who would help build this country.\n\nDespite his religious beliefs Wilberforce had little to fear and could always go to war and support any group he wanted. The only thing in between the two nations were the armies and the people.\n\nWilberforce was able to find some way to unite this country while still maintaining some of his faith. His faith was evident in what came after the Battle of Alford, which resulted in the victory of the Confederate troops over the Union Army.\n\nThis victory will remain a legacy that Wilberforce wants to remain in his heart forever.","token_len":430,"entropy":[7.0566,2.5674,3.9613,8.2787,7.657,4.2712,1.2192,0.1429,0.0062,9.5318,1.1965,1.4663,6.0427,3.5066,4.1798,2.2522,0.7153,0.8003,1.7172,4.9239,7.5422,1.8135,4.9246,2.6548,9.1294,1.1354,11.4076,0.4142,4.5796,1.7025,4.3751,0.8848,3.2257,1.8522,10.377,5.5503,6.2326,1.7798,1.4947,4.8505,0.8804,0.929,2.7238,0.7725,4.094,1.0425,1.8262,0.001,2.7248,6.2253,0.1121,5.7446,4.0341,0.593,0.3859,2.9755,2.2207,7.181,5.4646,1.2325,0.6914,1.0525,0.7532,1.0404,2.8495,0.179,2.5955,4.1074,3.7496,7.4537,0.0047,0.0011,1.2859,2.94,0.9724,3.2645,6.2589,1.1383,6.0251,6.0645,0.0137,5.4832,4.7542,0.1584,3.6151,5.1895,3.9414,0.7745,4.2677,3.5284,6.6344,3.417,3.2373,1.1608,0.3788,6.1391,6.2056,3.1842,4.0367,2.3157,1.1567,2.1126,1.3266,2.6269,3.4022,4.829,0.806,6.6259,1.4009,1.0544,0.4692,1.3554,0.0001,4.4585,1.8058,3.741,0.4943,0.2196,1.3993,2.8353,0.0035,0.0004,4.4539,0.7049,4.9803,1.1085,3.4181,7.2475,5.8589,0.5277,0.8799,1.358,6.6086,1.4414,0.6499,7.5122,3.8331,5.1183,6.7142,0.0183,3.4993,0.3824,3.0732,1.6531,2.7321,3.5094,3.6815,3.111,0.004,0.0004,1.4498,2.6706,2.1854,6.5393,6.648,2.8876,6.8454,3.5927,5.1211,1.7959,3.7315,0.0035,0.0007,4.0907,3.6654,0.2074,0.9802,3.0487,0.662,1.3334,2.5638,1.4516,1.3493,2.9811,3.1777,3.4667,2.9454,5.6254,1.0779,0.1299,5.0219,2.2539,3.321,3.3764,0.4729,6.9714,1.6064,0.7252,0.0001,3.2101,2.8442,2.0517,0.4499,1.4863,2.7065,0.8235,5.7681,0.0246,0.0054,1.5299,5.9144,6.1592,5.4074,3.8653,3.0969,0.8946,1.6097,2.9658,4.2761,1.3924,4.3178,1.0961,1.3329,2.1609,3.1788,2.3525,4.4903,3.7251,3.9007,1.0272,1.9177,4.4608,1.4596,5.2545,2.916,6.4753,2.2937,5.015,1.4465,4.1011,0.086,6.3572,0.219,0.9871,1.2059,1.2714,6.2295,5.9973,2.5819,1.0563,5.0632,1.3604,6.7524,1.3106,1.8246,3.4097,1.2301,3.5275,0.0638,3.5346,2.3051,1.6061,5.7633,3.191,0.0274,9.0204,0.9279,0.7573,0.0002,1.4713,0.0071,0.001,2.9122,0.3882,3.955,5.6707,4.5036,1.8427,1.486,2.4409,5.5974,2.5045,2.6406,0.671,1.6201,3.3669,0.6011,0.5953,4.5005,6.1802,1.3817,1.4179,1.3167,1.7246,4.8015,0.3633,1.0146,3.4631,0.7696,2.6267,2.209,3.2448,1.4039,6.7622,3.8738,4.0776,4.4516,4.4206,3.3459,3.2667,6.1651,0.9509,2.3546,5.6783,3.0358,2.6062,6.2999,3.8103,3.9757,1.2111,2.6698,0.4447,3.313,4.0443,2.9583,0.7459,1.0069,0.4723,0.0001,5.7416,1.4608,3.9741,0.6359,6.0382,0.0108,0.001,3.4177,3.6447,2.5365,2.462,3.5216,4.7477,4.6486,4.4024,1.2652,1.5006,4.6139,5.3343,2.3057,3.8698,1.175,1.3056,0.4537,3.2551,2.4807,1.4786,5.5197,3.5926,2.2918,1.2327,5.2713,3.1436,1.4704,5.3804,1.9811,1.0998,2.7358,1.0452,0.8133,0.0002,1.6357,0.0085,0.0012,1.8644,4.57,0.0192,3.8509,3.4955,4.7138,0.231,3.6293,4.2544,0.6268,5.1032,2.052,2.5263,3.6312,2.1929,0.9493,3.8513,0.715,3.4154,2.2774,1.4003,5.6371,0.7288,4.448,6.341,1.6179,1.5969,3.4986,0.0138,5.7397,6.3867,1.6178,2.4492,3.5638,0.0263,0.7826,4.2834,0.1015,0.7579,2.7892,3.478,3.0084,0.3138,1.8195,2.7281,0.6051,0.8281,0.0002,3.7113,2.5241,5.0628,4.5765,1.8795,2.2821,3.084,2.5154,0.0091,0.001,7.2519,0.1788,4.8164,2.3674,2.4517,2.8678,2.2534,0.1607]}
{"id":4607,"ended":false,"length":377,"text":"On 31 July 1942, Blamey informed Rowell that I Corps headquarters would be sent to Port Moresby to control operations in New Guinea. Rowell arrived in Port Moresby on 13 August 1942 and had the final word. She was ordered to destroy all facilities at the Port Moresby, including the water supply, and to ensure a complete breakdown of the supply line by the 21 January 1942. Rowell successfully destroyed four water supply lines in New Guinea and the entire southern border with New South Wales. Rowell also destroyed four water supply lines from the southern border into Queensland.\n\nAt this point, Rowell and I Corps had to reconvene due to the high risk of flooding from the Australian River which was entering the Queensland desert from the eastern Australian coastal States. Rowell was ordered to destroy as much of the supply line as possible so as to be at risk of over-flowing into the river valley. Rowell destroyed much of New South Wales but also demolished the entire southern border state of Melbourne and Port Moresby. The Queensland side were also ordered to destroy all commercial shipyard sites including all the iron ore mines. The two sides ended up working together, using ships for only short periods of time and working together in the event of a breakdown. Rowell also caused the release of the Queensland State Police.\n\nRowell was captured in her home island of Australia. Rowell would enter New Guinea in August 1942 where she was captured by the Australian navy. Rowell was released and returned home to Australia after a few weeks. Rowell's body was also transferred to the Port Moresby Military High School for the rest of her life. Rowell was then remanded to the United States to be charged with murder. Her cause of death is unknown.\n\nPublication history\n\nRoeer aircraft\nIt was first written in World War II that Rowell was the bomber under Lieutenant Colonel William M. Rea. After being dropped aboard the plane, it was given to the Commander of the Australian Aeroplane Corps, Lieutenant Commander Sir Christopher H. MacNeill.\n\nReferences","token_len":430,"entropy":[9.1257,2.8646,6.0436,0.3054,9.146,6.5682,4.2473,7.9469,10.305,3.6804,0.6366,6.6239,13.0513,6.8192,3.3058,0.8564,4.9279,0.4779,7.3324,4.256,0.0637,0.0001,1.5814,7.121,5.2579,1.8034,4.9605,1.2656,0.6393,2.9632,0.0027,5.8944,1.6107,1.1697,0.0177,0.0003,0.0001,0.79,4.2109,1.2246,1.4834,1.326,4.1471,3.1074,5.4676,1.5072,1.6204,6.2323,1.9622,3.4465,0.2459,5.1573,1.7982,5.8205,3.2164,1.6928,2.9921,0.2774,0.0006,0.0003,4.6604,1.8772,1.1683,5.4115,2.2218,1.0043,2.4158,1.4302,5.8528,3.5997,3.0976,4.902,0.3151,0.7037,4.1134,3.0848,3.4664,1.711,5.544,4.6026,2.846,1.0462,3.1348,0.0065,6.8512,2.1972,4.5945,2.8284,3.4791,1.3814,2.1183,2.2318,0.0076,1.7735,3.1958,4.0341,6.9994,4.8887,3.0275,1.5548,4.731,0.0549,0.7738,2.7036,0.0055,2.9138,0.9846,3.1979,1.839,1.3294,0.2725,3.5722,1.5275,3.4529,1.8031,4.5968,3.7169,1.1682,1.9242,0.0069,4.2193,2.4185,0.8395,0.6666,1.3792,0.0071,3.1415,2.3529,1.02,2.8759,3.7381,5.9297,1.9739,0.0007,6.7987,0.0341,1.0694,3.9138,2.6914,0.4234,3.8175,2.3368,0.8712,4.7786,6.3948,3.0763,1.8553,5.7574,1.1904,4.7596,7.2945,3.5852,0.8562,4.5318,3.1397,4.7318,7.4898,0.6309,2.5711,0.0038,2.3849,1.4281,0.1356,1.5108,5.451,1.6686,0.7824,0.1625,2.9821,0.8383,0.5579,0.3863,4.0784,2.1334,0.1807,4.4817,4.2572,4.257,0.2866,6.3468,2.0589,2.7683,0.0241,4.352,1.5156,5.9352,3.7797,0.6076,2.2071,0.0039,4.194,6.0271,0.058,5.8102,3.5488,0.0057,4.1918,2.0457,7.3788,2.0435,3.0627,3.9525,0.2948,6.8137,1.0145,6.7058,2.0713,6.2557,0.6659,0.0004,0.0,0.5487,2.5504,5.0253,6.3871,6.8146,2.0444,1.7047,0.019,0.7323,1.6035,7.0325,7.2893,4.5354,3.4601,3.4411,3.8486,2.7985,7.1754,0.9879,1.7358,1.8335,2.2938,4.9361,3.1976,6.8552,0.1784,4.9683,1.1261,3.9426,5.125,6.4846,4.228,6.9302,4.3562,0.243,0.4386,0.0069,2.2996,4.1602,1.6333,2.7496,2.4103,4.5205,0.2826,1.2346,3.3859,1.7757,2.9285,0.0042,2.3273,6.2721,2.3193,6.5338,0.0175,2.4941,4.4281,5.542,3.264,2.8297,0.766,0.0001,2.4998,0.0039,1.9187,6.1681,2.4834,6.2849,3.6914,5.0842,0.7891,5.6068,2.7113,2.7151,0.0027,5.5008,6.7838,2.9858,0.9972,2.2843,3.5141,0.2455,4.5799,0.1497,1.2321,3.2174,1.3873,1.1416,0.7966,3.9987,1.4709,1.9163,0.0016,1.0538,3.285,3.0643,2.8023,4.0406,1.2758,0.9889,3.9123,2.3835,2.3698,1.2965,1.0337,2.1344,0.002,2.721,3.8383,0.1696,6.1304,5.1515,0.1683,1.125,4.4075,0.2368,0.0006,0.0001,4.2007,7.0484,1.7963,2.4626,1.9289,5.499,0.0005,0.2153,0.0666,0.2849,2.2013,0.0022,1.2816,3.3682,6.7407,0.5511,0.7569,1.2045,4.4609,0.1766,2.735,1.506,5.1502,0.1925,2.8903,0.8777,4.0546,6.151,0.0387,0.012,2.2052,1.9288,0.5047,0.3933,0.0002,6.8269,1.112,3.0814,0.9188,0.0002,4.8437,5.407,6.1807,10.2406,2.2026,17.5654,0.9492,5.2533,7.1237,0.9493,6.6883,0.0112,0.4763,1.9195,2.0671,0.01,0.9463,2.4504,7.2513,6.7345,5.2362,1.1146,2.9157,4.8637,0.6296,6.3184,4.181,1.8237,4.8231,3.5983,6.1497,5.1881,1.0107,6.1389,0.8898,3.3032,0.3829,6.4976,1.1033,2.0145,6.2369,0.7912,0.4926,2.4791,7.5528,1.8154,0.3216,2.4501,1.2866,2.8575,3.2328,3.7093,5.0174,3.7848,0.3763,5.4396,4.7407,0.668,2.2477,0.0002,4.5201]}
{"id":1515,"ended":true,"length":408,"text":"Raju < unk >, the owner of Supreme Music, ventured into overseas distribution with Magadheera. He distributed the film in the USA via Blue Sky Cinemas Inc. The distribution rights of the film were on the line between Sony Pictures and Universal Records, so it had to be sold to a lesser agency, and while they made a commitment to release the film by the end of the year through distributors, Raju did not see any opportunity to make the film available outside of America.\n\nThe movie was made through one of the best distributors in the United States. It came into its own, thanks to the help of some big financial partners such as Totten Film Corporation, Paramount Pictures, Paramount Pictures and MGM (one of the most notable film creators in the United States and one of the world\u2019s leading producers). After several difficult times for the distributors, Raju decided to buy out the rights to the film by taking out the exclusive rights to produce the film under his own name. He is also very happy in this decision, and is very happy that the rights to the film were allowed to be handed over to him by the distributors in his name.\n\nRaju is very satisfied, and is confident that the movies would go on to the world, as long as they are made by the distributors. He is very sure that the distribution rights will be worth US$5 million, and will keep going up because it is made by the distributors. He is very happy about being a distributor, because he believes that \u201call of the distributors, including the big studios, will benefit from this transaction.\u201d He expressed that the distribution rights are being provided to a very large group of distributors. The distribution rights will continue to go up as the distribution deals with the big studios.\n\nRaju said that it is too soon to say if anything will come to light regarding the future of the release. He is currently waiting to hear what the next steps are for the film.

{"id":4644,"ended":true,"length":404,"text":"Jose was a weak and short @ - @ lived tropical storm that formed far from land on October 29. It moved generally northeast before becoming subtropical and then dissipating on November 1 near the North Pole. The remnants of the storm are moving northwest at a high of 20 mph, and moving slowly over the Pacific Northwest while a few minor tropical events have formed by the late night hours on Friday. It now has a range of 5-12 mph; the center is expected to develop shortly.\n\nIn addition, it is expected to move westward over the East Coast through the early morning hours on Saturday and continue along Southern coasts Friday and Saturday afternoon. On Saturday evening, it will cross through Maine and Maine northward through Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Philadelphia and dissipate gradually as a cold front approaches to the East Coast. It is expected to move westward at a speed of 25-40 mph while moving slowly northwards.\n\nWarm weather is expected throughout much of the week and into the weekend. At this time, the strongest winds and heaviest precipitation are expected. The cold front will move gradually northward toward the midweek. As the forecast tracks and intensifies, the front will reach tropical storm strength. By late next week, wind gusts may be higher than that. The risk is high that the front will become a stronger storm than the tropical storm. Tropical Storm Jose will pass through New York at a speed of at least 30 miles per hour on Friday evening and pass through northern Pennsylvania late on Saturday and Sunday evening. Tropical Storm Jose also will pass over central and southeastern Louisiana on Sunday and continue along the Mississippi River and toward the Tennessee valley between New Orleans and the Tennessee Valley. The storm will move westward at a high of 20 mph and remain a tropical storm until Monday morning.\n\nA powerful and powerful tropical storm made landfall on the U.S. southeastern coast early Friday morning. The storm had passed near Cape Cod. A massive, large storm surge, expected to dump up to 15 feet of rain, is now forecast to develop near the Cape. Hurricane season ends on August 21, 2018.","token_len":431,"entropy":[5.2814,2.7072,8.044,4.1949,4.6214,12.2892,8.9533,6.3802,13.0015,13.2604,2.4387,3.6708,7.1073,8.079,2.2747,5.323,3.2908,5.2353,3.4359,2.1198,3.2991,4.5595,10.3817,4.3251,5.7559,3.9369,6.4752,0.0021,0.0099,2.2816,2.6913,6.3811,1.6266,3.1846,1.3543,1.8792,6.2766,1.5941,5.2663,0.6196,0.3054,2.7787,6.9675,0.3177,1.1331,1.002,2.3676,4.3615,2.9823,2.7808,1.6246,3.969,5.1081,3.9639,0.6122,2.2739,2.1538,3.4034,3.5833,3.555,0.895,2.8981,3.2649,6.6733,4.6616,3.2198,5.5986,3.1472,4.1015,3.1424,3.57,5.4107,1.2023,3.975,3.539,3.4664,3.0865,4.5667,1.3216,3.2691,4.8065,2.1214,1.0464,4.4423,0.1435,3.7998,1.0274,3.6266,1.7046,6.663,2.3113,4.649,2.2557,3.4331,0.0501,4.8334,7.0179,1.8477,1.8542,0.0047,4.4698,2.8618,1.2783,3.4154,1.1332,2.0305,0.3418,2.6795,2.8947,1.2801,3.0829,0.5672,4.2195,0.589,4.3641,0.7694,3.5474,1.1024,0.6888,1.5626,0.8085,1.6068,3.4361,4.4239,6.2108,6.7692,7.0179,1.9359,0.1981,3.6804,0.6433,5.1105,0.9662,3.3418,0.4052,1.017,0.7277,4.1997,4.1176,6.4724,1.0084,3.6661,6.4706,0.6355,2.5597,5.7885,1.4414,3.4305,1.1242,0.3648,1.3568,0.1612,1.2778,6.3476,2.4202,7.7667,0.0145,6.1906,4.3276,3.3779,5.1409,0.2094,2.1881,4.7156,0.653,3.0433,0.0866,0.5318,1.9868,1.4518,0.5967,0.0408,1.6308,2.2244,0.2644,3.108,1.0875,3.8127,0.0866,3.7421,2.252,2.1448,0.0364,5.307,1.8978,1.4213,3.1704,4.2231,2.7114,0.8453,0.0002,5.5101,2.7975,1.8869,2.1231,0.5185,2.9707,3.5437,0.0048,0.4762,3.1425,1.8111,4.4147,0.7427,1.5198,0.9206,5.0366,3.4606,0.4694,0.846,1.5318,4.5751,1.1993,2.7847,5.8626,1.9946,1.012,0.1852,2.2222,1.9761,4.277,0.5979,1.4801,2.3546,5.4622,2.1155,0.4193,3.742,0.5809,4.191,5.2451,2.9293,4.5727,1.0525,4.5093,8.1471,4.346,4.1066,0.006,0.2506,1.1715,4.3349,0.6849,4.5176,6.8361,3.5058,3.6097,2.4387,5.3233,2.2254,4.282,0.1318,0.1812,4.1514,1.8976,0.0176,3.6648,1.5828,3.6327,0.4765,4.9688,3.7481,2.3373,6.8168,1.9621,2.5591,1.1256,1.1237,0.7908,0.4439,2.6371,1.7832,4.7845,3.222,1.9403,2.0873,3.9508,0.8736,2.1485,5.8532,1.7826,4.9219,1.7197,3.9979,1.5077,3.0266,1.1884,3.484,2.443,1.3362,0.0757,5.6992,0.011,2.3217,4.2644,0.0744,0.0016,2.2968,1.8208,2.9542,1.4457,3.8734,0.625,4.9764,3.4817,4.5521,2.4896,0.156,2.8642,2.7378,3.0295,0.2822,4.1766,0.218,0.6544,4.4935,1.27,0.3736,3.4053,4.7519,1.8382,3.2183,4.811,1.6016,2.0875,2.0379,4.514,3.3779,0.735,3.2356,0.7813,2.576,4.677,1.15,5.4538,5.584,6.1241,3.1553,0.4455,0.0532,4.2572,1.8571,1.2128,0.6223,2.0807,2.6512,1.0966,2.0462,2.2483,0.2917,1.9005,0.3193,2.2035,0.2772,2.0185,0.0682,1.7155,5.1451,4.281,2.2081,0.6623,2.0726,3.9112,1.1363,0.3571,0.5686,0.0002,3.6844,5.2388,3.8318,2.047,1.1135,0.1981,6.1377,0.052,1.666,1.3847,4.2192,0.0031,0.0043,0.1594,6.6572,0.1,3.2303,1.4166,0.7278,0.9845,1.2223,0.8584,4.4356,5.3563,3.8731,3.4506,1.6323,3.5947,3.2823,4.6368,3.7657,5.7201,2.3414,0.6988,3.5337,4.5756,0.3227,6.0551,2.0745,0.009,4.0052,1.1088,0.4136,0.5803,0.9638,3.2104,5.7292,2.7112,2.1225,4.4518,3.425,1.2941,2.5168,1.5132,4.7451,6.6725,3.4378,1.0607,4.0069,3.1401,1.8164,2.64,0.4057]}
{"id":3825,"ended":true,"length":397,"text":"Charles II, who promoted a number of Roman Catholics at court, granted Wright a measure of royal art patronage. In 1661, soon after the coronation, he painted a formalised portrait of the King on the wall of the Saint Paul Cathedral in a beautiful blue and white colour, the exact size of the portrait of Christ himself. Waverley also drew out another painting of Charles II and of his father King William, which was painted of him at the time of his death.\n\nThe royal family consists of one of the best known members of this dynasty. William II is one of the most valuable and well-known of all of them, who became Prince of Wales in 1638. William had been a Catholic since 1647, but had had the opposite background because his grandfather William was a priest. Charles II was married briefly to Elizabeth II in 1637 and, after a bitter marriage, she was taken to Paris in 1638.\n\nWright's marriage in 1642 is celebrated by Pope Benedict VII in the new year. In 1654, the Pope announced his election to the Prince of Wales' Council. On February 5, 1656, Queen Charlotte married William III. On March 27, 1657, the Queen received her first royal wedding, which was held at St Michael's Chapel where William III was the Duke of Clarence. On April 1, 1659, the Duke of Clarence was sworn in before the Queen. On October 23, 1659, William was married again and, while he was still a Catholic, married his first wife, Elizabeth, only nine months after they had met.\n\nWright himself was probably born in 1585, but a few years before the birth of his son Earl of Gloucester, he married the daughter of Edward VII. Edward, Earl of Essex, was King of England from 1537 until his death in 1653 at the age of 52. When his son died in 1661, he died. When Francis, Earl of Argyle, of 1636, his wife died in 1660, they were then the only surviving adult children of William III, wife Elizabeth.","token_len":431,"entropy":[8.2183,1.803,2.4827,8.0907,3.3172,5.1417,0.0041,5.6827,4.6197,5.0308,6.9802,0.6952,8.2582,9.9768,1.4043,7.6131,0.0198,5.3383,12.532,6.5563,1.1804,2.7091,3.0637,4.8512,0.496,7.759,0.0794,1.3795,5.8881,0.0024,2.0217,1.7554,8.0999,1.1522,8.3002,5.9072,1.9386,0.0976,1.8394,3.6725,3.2174,1.04,2.2121,0.297,0.8628,7.5856,3.2228,2.294,1.6114,5.0029,7.0874,4.8482,3.1414,0.6495,5.2618,2.142,3.7842,5.9651,3.8638,0.2656,1.7329,2.8767,4.8143,3.797,4.4544,0.6326,6.7698,7.2688,0.8311,3.7607,4.5431,4.6049,6.3256,3.5311,1.118,5.383,0.7527,3.3565,4.892,2.2498,3.5917,5.1845,2.8238,1.6913,2.2962,1.6391,3.5082,3.129,2.989,3.6728,0.8945,2.2627,1.0416,0.3934,0.8894,0.86,1.0773,0.0037,2.156,4.4041,3.9673,7.4309,0.1488,4.1228,1.9086,0.6527,5.1359,0.8332,2.6949,0.0526,3.8491,4.0737,2.2908,3.0292,3.0834,2.333,3.3998,0.0167,0.3484,0.9712,6.1983,2.414,2.7373,0.5167,0.3893,2.1599,1.9146,3.797,2.9103,1.045,4.3248,3.9617,4.2229,1.4288,0.0217,0.7654,0.6391,4.3463,1.0396,2.4575,4.246,1.7037,2.3948,5.0845,2.6501,3.0191,4.1341,0.8421,2.0366,2.9191,4.9101,3.642,6.0555,7.2417,6.5227,2.9149,4.3425,3.8824,1.7146,0.9443,4.2015,1.1189,4.9919,1.1684,0.9743,4.8099,6.9946,0.413,3.7624,3.0751,0.8606,0.2173,4.1454,1.8524,3.2315,2.566,2.4686,5.7897,2.4543,0.5559,4.365,2.267,3.1893,1.3275,4.4862,1.9983,0.3159,1.9518,1.433,2.0509,0.0002,3.2937,1.5264,1.4489,4.8376,4.8726,0.3298,2.9685,4.863,5.1972,1.7007,3.5488,4.1207,5.4991,2.3779,1.6523,6.4,2.7723,1.5854,2.6439,1.8298,4.0785,0.3929,2.2802,1.5206,4.832,1.9618,6.1743,1.5045,0.1551,7.81,0.5167,0.0314,5.046,4.2463,2.1407,4.0816,3.9796,3.1046,0.6782,0.526,1.7707,0.0666,5.7028,4.1456,4.0297,2.3518,2.4156,2.131,3.0319,2.1365,4.4079,0.0851,0.8035,1.1197,0.0767,1.5587,2.0601,4.3559,2.7449,1.4103,2.1035,3.1012,2.6122,2.5523,0.9154,2.8272,0.815,1.9171,4.7532,0.1007,3.3835,6.0002,1.8856,2.1781,0.9823,3.1053,3.7176,0.0637,3.5977,0.7107,2.6193,1.2588,2.7163,0.0812,0.59,2.1206,0.081,1.3464,2.1295,0.2084,0.2494,1.3662,3.6,0.1848,7.8498,0.4826,1.5763,1.2555,2.0068,3.757,3.5633,0.0572,0.7285,2.4199,0.079,1.5713,2.4615,3.7865,3.4269,3.369,2.58,5.0688,2.2821,0.192,1.8925,2.0426,2.7006,0.2554,2.5824,1.9327,2.5301,1.1182,0.8387,1.9319,1.7625,6.5479,4.8842,0.9365,0.5334,3.3591,1.2154,2.333,0.2838,0.9323,0.0002,2.0892,0.1737,5.2113,1.4612,6.0706,3.0977,0.5575,4.2803,4.2548,1.1698,1.8711,4.8766,2.6616,0.4575,2.1381,2.732,3.2642,0.048,1.0816,2.0748,6.4687,1.2633,2.4857,0.0256,0.6618,1.3051,2.1443,2.6891,1.3131,0.0388,3.8473,2.7506,1.6738,3.0523,2.7787,5.1373,0.0072,4.2829,0.2336,1.0119,4.5598,0.4345,0.7105,1.2004,0.7121,4.6989,1.5429,1.5583,0.0853,0.2984,2.1874,4.1791,3.8061,0.2353,0.0389,0.0008,4.9768,0.1374,4.6309,2.6119,1.5084,2.3144,0.8344,0.245,3.8342,0.1361,1.2614,3.3356,6.3151,4.5988,6.5938,3.1077,1.7834,0.0063,5.0958,0.5069,2.308,0.2885,5.1085,8.161,4.1731,0.6993,6.3857,2.9629,1.7206,0.5255,0.2716,3.5033,0.1256,2.4245,1.7668,6.8608,4.0286,2.0374,1.0775,7.1736,2.2417,0.2771,3.0932,1.3637,2.1787,6.9611,5.9719,1.6242]}

The website's consensus reads, \"On average, the reviews collected from these four critics will receive a score of \"3 or 4\" out of 5, while the majority of these critics will have gotten 4, so 4 is an improvement.\" It's unclear whether these critics had an \"4\" rating on the site or if they got an \"In\" rating from other critics.\nCheck out this round of our round of reviews today, if you'd like to receive one of these reviews for free...\n(Click to skip\nMORE FROM THE WEB Click to zoom\nRotten Tomatoes currently has 9 million reviews across its reviews as of last week. To rate an item on Rotten Tomatoes, you need to have an average of 32 reviews a day from critics.\nOf that report, 771 people picked an item that fell into that category in 2020 or below. In that range, only 25 percent of critics picked a book that \"lame that day\".\nSo, according to Rotten Tomatoes, only 25% of all reviews will be in the top five for a book that fell in that category. That's a 9% fall.\nAnd that's just in 2020.\nWith the exception of an average of 5 critics going through the website daily, the overall ratings on websites that rank books out of 5, such as Google Books and Amazon, are low. But, when readers do turn to other sites to get their favorite stories, the reviews are often high. When we look at a website like the Star Science Review, we see a higher rating for a book that dropped in the rankings.\nThat's why this year, Rotten Tomatoes said that this year's list of \"best-selling books released from 2018 to 2019\" will see a record-shattering change: This website will rank books out of 5 from the best to the least, then compare them to a list that has been ranked by the best review aggregator site.","token_len":431,"entropy":[8.6611,11.2427,5.8637,6.4436,6.8707,2.2175,0.1445,0.0,4.4945,3.0518,5.8666,6.8745,4.7851,0.1923,4.4701,3.4803,0.6298,1.9823,0.029,2.366,14.7077,5.6606,8.0819,9.22,5.1357,2.3619,5.2327,0.0493,8.4338,0.6752,0.554,2.0424,3.9685,2.5877,6.9673,6.8212,2.3949,0.1883,5.9499,1.3718,0.2351,1.8349,2.2294,7.3058,2.7239,3.7558,4.143,3.9711,4.9637,5.2321,1.4931,2.7244,0.1907,4.5687,2.8045,3.6398,1.0463,2.0438,3.7424,0.0006,0.8968,2.3468,3.1704,0.9773,4.3842,0.2601,3.5286,3.2346,1.1166,3.3967,7.5809,2.9633,4.358,4.4943,4.3529,1.3524,3.6964,5.4085,1.6889,4.6292,1.6873,3.0846,1.7109,3.0576,3.0418,3.6485,3.334,3.6877,7.4083,1.319,2.0786,2.3581,1.0262,1.4752,1.608,1.7931,0.6641,4.0572,2.3924,0.7742,6.7374,2.889,0.7022,2.8863,3.8744,2.9765,0.5027,0.5476,17.2947,0.1422,2.5875,6.2754,2.9003,4.4463,5.7927,2.4139,2.9011,6.0712,2.3947,5.0096,0.1146,2.8125,0.0489,0.1855,5.4283,4.5142,0.5084,1.6862,2.0559,3.2202,0.6563,6.7426,0.8623,4.9513,3.51,1.7329,5.8232,8.3018,9.3759,2.1595,1.9863,3.5485,0.5987,8.521,1.1197,7.0105,3.1795,3.9534,0.1336,0.0267,0.0002,6.7163,0.9864,4.7137,3.037,2.3593,5.1161,3.3366,4.2133,5.9737,0.3626,4.3682,1.0185,0.5673,5.1182,6.2206,2.9431,4.0517,1.3317,1.5767,0.0001,0.0087,0.0002,0.439,1.3432,1.8091,0.1093,1.8718,2.3152,0.914,3.2367,7.1393,0.539,6.9217,0.4171,3.9732,6.1263,1.2424,2.2187,5.5241,3.8114,8.1449,0.2031,3.9635,5.1231,4.0244,5.6966,3.3266,1.7653,3.1432,6.6142,2.0337,2.9597,0.3743,4.5566,11.6262,3.4939,4.209,0.4917,3.878,2.6332,6.2788,0.1077,3.4677,5.0592,3.4771,0.9147,3.8046,1.8234,2.1489,4.3062,1.6761,4.3787,3.9458,7.2009,8.0487,6.2965,3.2389,1.1021,4.274,1.376,4.9782,0.0018,1.4713,0.0017,0.006,0.0005,0.3353,4.8104,3.3294,1.4988,0.1254,4.3723,0.7112,3.4242,1.0026,4.0964,1.6865,3.6348,2.4704,2.8869,1.3058,0.4983,1.4615,3.8785,2.441,0.9424,0.2467,1.0909,2.4388,1.021,1.3047,5.4692,1.5654,5.0754,2.5072,0.7625,3.5058,1.9483,0.5375,1.8665,3.7024,3.7548,1.0167,1.3558,4.9051,2.1271,2.7326,0.0018,4.0518,3.7328,0.4836,3.2296,4.7921,6.183,3.5788,1.5028,5.3566,3.7203,0.3831,1.8444,4.121,4.2044,3.3962,7.7682,2.8171,4.085,3.3861,5.8335,0.037,2.6349,4.0219,4.8215,0.0024,4.3498,1.976,1.9939,0.9033,1.0111,1.2146,5.3735,0.539,3.8242,2.3174,4.1569,7.1131,4.5856,6.1566,0.3603,3.0331,1.94,1.97,3.6564,1.0078,5.3651,5.0087,0.7491,2.2111,2.2806,1.6309,3.9751,4.106,0.6259,5.544,3.3262,3.6925,0.1519,3.3595,3.5736,2.7334,4.0515,7.2371,9.3674,3.2088,0.5108,1.3323,1.1569,1.7472,5.3408,2.8541,1.4695,1.7633,0.9013,1.2102,6.227,1.3515,1.0505,4.725,1.4784,0.6181,3.5367,0.9036,2.7127,3.5797,3.2622,1.6369,1.974,0.0038,0.0021,0.0003,4.6185,1.6235,4.347,0.443,1.0678,3.7382,1.0027,2.6991,2.009,3.1042,1.063,1.4972,7.8949,4.3307,3.9885,2.1725,1.1074,0.9812,2.3513,4.2271,0.927,5.7191,3.0657,6.791,0.1549,6.4715,3.8944,6.4243,8.0557,1.4536,3.4556,1.6594,1.9983,0.0078,0.6311,3.7233,2.0371,3.9801,3.5948,0.3954,3.3984,4.4672,6.0159,4.8839,1.9823,0.8264,3.1175,0.9197,3.416,2.8532,1.7733,2.3409,2.4025,2.1818,3.7252,5.518,2.3481,0.0842,3.1539,1.369]}
{"id":245,"ended":true,"length":359,"text":"Even after complete remission is achieved, leukemic cells likely remain in numbers too small to be detected with current diagnostic techniques. If no further postremission or consolidation therapy is given, almost all lysine-containing cells will remain as they were in the past. Once again, the cells will slowly degrade as more data is collected, resulting in greater loss of cell counts.\n\nLysine is an important nutrient for the cell population of the immune system. Because it is a nutrient for the immune cells to digest and digest, there is a need for increased levels of leukine-treated cells to decrease the levels of leukine in the cell.\n\nHere is an example of a cell cycle (cell) of lysine that had been observed in cells harvested from an immunoassay. This is a cell cycle of leukine that was observed at a dose of less than 80% of the normal value.\n\nWhen Lysine is in the cell cycle, the cells that were in the cell cycle have a tendency to produce large amounts of lysine. For example, an immunoassay with a lysine dose of less than 80% of the normal value and a lysine dose of less than 80% of the normal value showed a much decreased incidence of leukine-induced cell cycle in mice. However, the cell cycle of less than 80% of the normal values showed a higher incidence of leukine induced cell cycle than this one with a lysine dose of less than 80% of the normal values.\n\nFurthermore, leukine is needed in the production of both free-cell and leukocyte (cell) monoclonal antibodies. In the present study the cell cycle of leukine was found to be more common in mice than it was in mice.\n\nThese results are presented in the literature. These findings are in line with our research on leukine and leucine expression in cancer cells and of leukocytes for anti-cancer therapy.\n\nThis study provides a detailed explanation and a detailed review of the research.","token_len":431,"entropy":[5.9177,8.7411,6.7033,5.89,1.421,0.2588,8.9007,3.3239,0.9592,2.4149,9.9437,3.4264,1.8343,11.4009,7.3807,0.2874,0.336,1.1766,2.8248,3.5662,3.7133,3.1641,1.8286,0.4617,4.8467,5.2531,3.1953,7.3022,6.1784,0.0663,5.22,9.4239,4.3515,0.3377,4.8396,0.3245,8.3516,0.4079,6.3785,1.5329,3.5007,1.7549,2.5235,1.7425,1.6771,2.0472,4.2143,2.4306,0.976,1.2647,0.9074,1.836,0.5402,5.9166,4.1434,0.1508,1.9677,5.0188,2.2527,6.3977,4.163,2.5914,4.9282,6.7787,1.8141,0.7071,2.0834,4.1844,0.0026,4.9631,2.5656,0.0818,3.1895,3.8814,0.7062,1.1659,0.0006,4.0166,0.2944,0.0301,1.8353,2.4719,2.1168,2.8037,1.4388,1.5688,3.9186,5.2429,3.0745,1.2017,3.7524,0.0438,0.7551,4.5082,1.2822,0.636,2.2436,3.9362,2.7798,0.9869,2.4736,2.9505,2.8368,3.3353,1.6827,3.7061,0.3944,4.7828,0.4132,1.0395,1.8932,0.5001,4.3901,1.9255,0.1173,3.0058,0.5209,4.577,3.4201,7.9727,0.517,1.4683,5.9667,0.8742,3.2486,0.054,1.5455,0.0764,3.0857,1.9326,0.3963,3.6066,1.345,3.326,0.0002,6.9149,1.2632,1.594,1.0116,0.2162,1.1799,3.0132,5.7686,4.4756,4.4918,5.2403,3.5504,3.2728,0.0109,0.0047,2.9625,4.6113,1.3639,6.1355,1.1728,4.6328,4.9969,0.2943,3.7103,4.2115,2.6498,0.8363,0.0278,1.8011,3.5256,1.8647,1.0912,2.6131,0.5197,2.2889,3.4648,0.0429,1.5036,2.2485,1.6733,2.1376,3.3057,2.2819,3.3322,0.3523,6.0102,0.0051,5.4222,4.0288,0.382,0.684,2.7657,3.4779,0.9852,2.2998,0.0002,4.0891,7.2627,0.0146,1.3245,3.9722,0.9168,1.3168,1.9048,0.258,1.4129,1.5891,2.8943,1.7257,3.4637,0.4019,1.9018,0.0858,3.1402,1.431,4.2696,0.1457,3.1345,4.0271,0.5101,0.0095,1.7753,0.0148,0.0147,1.0554,4.8957,0.4549,0.031,4.0344,1.7245,0.1457,0.0007,0.0009,3.2157,1.5223,4.1209,0.0439,0.0238,2.8642,0.1253,3.623,0.0058,1.3573,0.0989,0.4687,0.4071,0.2113,0.341,4.443,0.9042,2.7431,0.0117,0.0043,1.0255,0.0964,2.2658,0.009,1.6736,0.0234,0.0409,0.087,0.2817,0.1626,2.4126,1.3109,5.6616,5.4372,4.5971,0.0332,1.6904,0.0962,2.1515,1.3288,1.3938,2.2411,2.2309,4.0365,3.9891,0.8115,3.0589,0.0109,1.6159,4.0919,0.2318,1.4197,6.7571,0.0177,0.0763,0.014,0.1999,0.0831,0.1009,3.6205,2.824,0.8493,3.904,0.7107,0.0882,0.504,0.0042,0.0098,3.39,0.6322,0.0155,2.8765,5.2941,4.1634,3.9737,0.5503,0.8126,0.0044,0.0057,0.252,0.1256,0.7385,0.0056,0.1224,0.3393,0.0449,0.0088,0.0171,3.4721,0.2165,1.0225,0.0002,6.1019,0.0071,4.1049,0.0265,0.0268,1.6684,5.3072,2.6699,1.0729,3.337,0.0555,5.5434,5.3774,3.5838,9.5994,0.9017,3.5307,0.0625,1.373,4.4183,3.0843,0.2795,5.8797,1.5669,0.0272,0.0038,0.0759,0.8411,2.6968,1.932,2.9785,0.2872,3.9569,4.1399,0.5129,0.3348,2.6661,0.0052,0.1193,1.0908,4.065,0.0494,0.3657,3.8414,5.0716,0.5911,2.1091,1.4665,2.7918,0.1884,0.0263,2.2164,4.656,1.6993,0.0002,4.3172,1.1309,2.4984,5.1067,0.7302,1.7309,4.9845,2.4103,3.5387,1.6718,1.4724,3.0551,1.3445,0.0015,3.8055,4.7124,2.2649,2.089,0.0466,2.0967,2.1414,2.1949,3.3194,0.0332,7.9843,1.1743,5.5096,0.5325,2.254,5.1649,2.3954,0.4744,2.762,5.9481,6.7707,0.06,0.9528,3.1676,0.5638,0.7182,0.0002,3.6951,1.0508,3.2316,1.7505,3.7519,3.986,4.0191,3.5547,3.3075,3.3991,0.1711,0.4653,4.9811,1.9649]}
{"id":732,"ended":true,"length":410,"text":"The remains of the Byzantine @ - @ era church in Jifna testifies to the existence of a Christian community prior to the Muslim conquest. It continued to exist during the Middle Ages and is one of the best surviving sites of Byzantine architecture, with a beautiful mural by an expert, including a huge mosaic of Byzantine architecture visible by two towers above. It is home to the largest Byzantine Temple in the Kingdom (15,000-1550 AD). We are so glad to have lost the museum to the state. It is remarkable that there is still such a large mosaic of Byzantine architecture and remains, despite the fact that it was once demolished. That means that there is only two more historical sites left of the historic Byzantine era. The first is that of Thessalonica and the second is the building on the corner of the town of Biondios - there was no public church at that date. Only the site where the church is now stands on a hill. Even in the ruins is still the seat of Byzantine leadership. At this time, the church was built around 1330 AD. The construction of the church was halted shortly before the Holy Week. The main monument has been left only on the second corner and it is in the ruins and is in the ruins.\n\nSo what is left of the Byzantine era church is a monument for history and today is a monument to our historic era, an important building. If it were destroyed, the ruins of Jifna city could become the center of one of the most important cities in Eastern Europe. We could build for many centuries the Byzantine Temple and build it again to symbolize the history of both our ancient and modern world. We have the Byzantine Museum in the ruins of our church and it already has the Byzantine National Heritage Site.\n\nHow much more can we do to keep the Byzantine Empire and the many centuries of history to live on? For a lot of European countries there are no longer places for religious and cultural activities but there is still a lot of Roman heritage. Not to forget that it now has many churches that are just monuments and monuments. We need to do more.","token_len":431,"entropy":[8.6085,0.3242,1.3524,8.5687,12.7415,8.3182,3.9786,9.129,8.2521,2.2351,6.7606,8.0562,5.0599,11.1782,1.2073,0.2776,1.0419,3.9587,0.0453,1.4241,4.5663,4.0046,7.0924,0.0036,0.7004,6.7272,0.8392,1.6474,3.6467,8.3467,1.0096,1.152,3.0201,0.2662,4.734,0.072,1.7505,2.4385,3.9216,0.0363,0.1297,4.0899,3.9045,3.0227,1.0638,1.7814,1.4103,2.9346,3.2839,2.2902,4.5087,5.5635,3.3834,5.2914,4.8785,3.4317,4.1486,2.0498,5.4687,3.2565,0.7849,2.7594,3.2857,7.5454,4.4669,5.1496,5.3741,2.9508,1.16,3.0328,1.0604,5.3263,0.0568,1.1723,3.5961,1.1554,5.8384,0.6441,0.5339,7.5438,3.8345,5.393,1.467,0.3727,1.8249,2.599,8.6375,1.0402,1.3625,5.5304,2.2475,4.9242,2.7075,0.5822,0.9892,6.5871,2.1899,6.7801,2.6386,1.0172,5.8376,1.709,3.0829,1.0276,6.6527,0.8066,4.0077,1.2386,1.7737,1.6297,0.5979,2.7224,6.1334,1.0578,0.6628,0.1901,3.4007,6.1481,2.8628,4.1156,0.8991,1.6769,0.1253,1.4188,0.8899,4.5025,5.4224,1.2719,6.1782,5.5303,0.9014,3.0266,0.9573,4.2299,5.2076,3.74,5.4882,1.0264,2.5485,2.1746,0.5739,4.9092,1.8379,3.5045,1.6996,1.8695,2.0982,1.0521,5.0204,0.2997,5.184,1.8226,1.1682,0.0073,2.9924,1.3659,0.6134,0.4759,1.6641,5.3007,4.3153,0.967,4.6976,0.116,2.6083,6.6777,1.1673,4.3201,5.8106,4.8535,6.7296,5.671,5.9104,2.1452,2.1156,5.7414,4.1538,2.5591,1.2623,4.6391,0.6065,5.7255,1.5081,6.1378,3.0045,0.8002,2.8626,2.1746,1.7933,2.5016,3.3694,2.2358,1.6277,1.5891,5.8546,3.2926,0.9871,4.5002,4.9561,2.6737,2.1625,8.1543,0.0266,2.4215,7.1088,0.8199,5.0946,2.4318,1.1798,1.1221,1.3203,3.0585,0.7683,2.2173,4.4388,6.0763,3.6583,0.4854,1.346,1.4005,6.3527,0.335,0.5406,1.0938,1.3854,5.1112,5.137,2.0373,0.6821,6.1584,3.9335,1.8962,1.3573,5.6639,5.641,4.4817,0.8243,4.1764,5.3993,2.7389,0.6198,3.8246,5.2482,3.4161,2.6578,0.9072,4.1333,1.4126,3.8476,4.7046,2.349,3.4728,1.4238,2.2782,2.8643,3.4117,0.3959,5.5352,2.5489,1.5067,4.3319,0.6785,0.5308,1.9378,2.3449,1.5716,3.8737,2.9506,3.6727,4.2123,4.6248,1.6108,7.2195,2.582,1.5147,2.9642,1.2147,4.0054,5.6395,3.9574,2.9333,4.4,2.2951,3.0383,2.1411,4.5185,2.8539,1.8751,3.0338,0.9345,2.1455,3.5444,1.667,5.6579,0.0099,0.0041,6.4879,3.0269,3.604,1.8504,3.2489,0.0789,4.5679,0.0598,0.2396,1.157,0.4336,3.1369,0.3694,4.5895,0.1981,0.5347,3.0274,4.4276,4.2502,6.6468,2.9969,0.9112,2.2437,4.3411,4.5824,2.2417,4.4014,2.7867,2.9478,3.3099,5.6549,0.1437,0.7864,3.1017,0.2342,6.3753,2.5574,3.1396,1.2739,0.3573,2.6141,0.1767,2.1726,2.7212,2.7698,4.217,4.3488,2.0426,1.7968,4.573,0.744,2.8685,4.2004,1.3704,2.2253,6.4224,0.8615,2.0721,2.7715,6.5083,3.8333,2.8789,0.9869,2.0469,0.0004,5.3697,3.2984,3.0013,2.0602,0.5728,1.448,1.2631,4.1884,1.1482,2.0164,3.2157,3.3354,1.3298,6.8559,3.5891,0.3256,1.7066,5.5338,6.2611,3.5199,0.9782,4.7641,3.2521,4.6599,0.8432,5.1024,1.1975,3.7202,1.2801,2.1243,5.3474,4.9671,1.8752,4.3924,2.8651,0.698,1.7642,4.7059,2.7759,1.2592,1.6058,0.7507,2.5127,0.4857,6.8864,4.2364,1.5915,6.2825,3.2294,3.3856,1.1603,3.8074,6.9326,1.8083,3.567,2.1658,2.9986,1.4554,5.7471,6.2593,2.4539,2.0683,2.3556,2.3533,1.9192,0.2945,3.8185,1.1137,2.5046]}

{"id":1671,"ended":true,"length":412,"text":"A directed acyclic graph may be used to represent a network of processing elements. In this representation, data enters a processing element through its incoming edges and leaves the element through its outgoing edges. A processed edge is then transferred to another processing element. More specifically, an edge is transferred to another processing element, while the processing element is rendered invisible in time by another processing element. The process of transferring an edge to another processing element can be used to convey the processed edge across a network. For example, a system may use an integrated circuit (IC), such as a memory (e.g., a nonvolatile storage memory), to transfer an edge across a network. For example, a system may use a network processor to use the network network as a processing element because the network processor is a cache to read data from memory. The cache is used as a cache to load a cache of the processing element. The cache holds data which may have a lower value than that in the packet network.\nIt is known in the art to utilize a sequential method of transfer in addition to the method of transfer. In an example given by P. DeMarco et al., \u201cIn A Process of Transfer,\u201d IEEE Trans. Circuits (1991), the memory-processing element is moved to the processing element from the memory, while the processing element is moved back to the memory. As an example, when a process processor is moved to the memory by use of a system packet storage (SPS) such as an image of an interface node, the packet-storage element transferred to the processor in turn transfers the packet to the processing element. On the other hand, when a process processor is moved to the memory by use of a system packet storage (SPS), the packet-storage element transferred to the processor in turn transfers the packet to the processing element. Similarly, when a process processor is moved to a memory by use of a system storage processor, the packet-storage element transferred to the processing element transferred to the processor in turn transfers the packet to the processing element. Accordingly, a process processor may transfer data between any processing elements.","token_len":431,"entropy":[10.9834,7.6037,5.7688,0.0717,0.7439,8.297,7.262,1.0706,1.8312,0.8634,4.5087,1.8841,6.3693,1.0398,9.9323,3.5631,1.5574,2.905,1.4365,7.2698,0.2967,5.4347,8.267,1.8407,4.478,1.0101,3.3722,3.4271,8.4822,6.9687,1.2782,5.1844,1.1039,5.7973,3.812,0.1832,2.5238,0.0573,0.2837,3.0397,7.0728,3.1756,1.2073,4.3033,4.4866,0.6026,2.3123,0.3266,0.0943,1.5559,6.8977,2.2428,0.0313,2.5923,2.5652,1.2285,2.2853,0.7504,1.5303,0.1616,0.0346,3.3233,4.3325,1.287,1.9894,0.1544,1.3955,5.6912,5.2152,3.6968,6.3788,2.8472,4.2528,0.324,0.0696,0.2635,2.1602,3.0495,2.8709,3.4372,2.2968,0.1875,1.1515,0.2045,0.0722,0.0048,3.2159,0.4478,3.6102,0.2999,4.9922,2.5468,5.3922,0.5522,5.467,1.4167,1.2913,1.1225,2.4894,0.2167,0.032,1.4739,4.8196,1.6164,2.7558,1.931,4.8454,1.7173,1.9755,0.1821,2.6031,2.0433,0.0121,0.3956,5.2774,5.0023,3.8246,0.006,0.0003,0.0668,1.3958,6.4127,2.6847,0.001,2.4706,5.7519,0.6745,0.4385,1.5713,1.4914,0.2026,2.3564,0.3764,0.4831,0.5445,3.9581,2.0275,0.0104,0.8226,1.4238,0.3576,0.9212,0.7763,3.3412,5.2086,1.5943,4.8872,2.2014,2.1729,5.8772,2.8827,0.5334,2.6711,1.3298,7.0308,1.2773,2.6665,0.2496,1.7782,2.6629,7.1976,4.6988,5.8754,1.771,0.6541,3.4431,0.8017,2.0017,5.0428,1.6229,2.4578,2.5484,0.5136,2.7485,1.4621,5.9932,3.4031,2.6282,2.3978,3.0842,1.7105,0.6638,1.3325,1.5315,2.5487,5.2283,1.3716,4.2194,2.6621,3.1719,3.4948,5.4652,3.2715,0.5147,1.8594,3.2918,0.4047,7.3303,6.5697,0.6793,2.1874,15.9362,0.5526,4.4795,3.9027,1.3093,1.1854,6.5395,5.3082,1.2382,5.9598,5.6731,1.3552,1.8237,3.5611,5.0491,0.0022,1.356,4.7577,0.4086,1.6038,4.2009,1.7536,3.7004,2.5273,6.0521,4.1103,5.6709,2.816,7.9713,4.6678,2.8933,0.027,0.4303,10.9974,10.79,4.2004,5.1525,4.5262,3.4683,1.32,1.2004,5.3987,7.1734,12.0381,1.5712,0.2712,4.8567,2.8056,3.3729,5.3003,1.468,2.205,6.2247,3.8319,4.7245,1.8391,1.3723,4.8549,1.1339,0.8914,1.9898,0.5224,4.341,1.0037,1.3416,2.6094,3.4024,0.3104,1.0003,0.0265,0.4549,1.4747,2.9763,0.3447,0.1464,1.0562,0.633,4.1461,3.4366,0.5791,0.3304,4.1127,1.4772,1.2882,8.0103,1.3062,2.2614,0.7527,0.9813,1.1335,2.9534,7.4097,0.0388,0.9547,5.5602,7.2,7.2135,3.048,3.0152,1.3726,1.8861,4.4659,0.0883,2.7479,5.2521,7.6411,1.9531,6.3753,6.8355,0.4934,0.8075,5.9289,3.0342,1.9484,1.2603,7.6577,0.4379,0.1921,1.5371,3.9278,3.4712,2.6439,1.1572,2.2592,1.131,0.2926,1.8215,0.0212,0.5874,5.6742,0.1032,0.2067,0.0055,0.0093,0.5303,0.6953,0.1878,0.0576,0.1251,0.2786,0.3789,0.2452,0.3025,0.1045,0.3965,0.0019,0.5624,1.1047,1.0059,0.0834,0.4853,0.1627,0.0091,0.6572,0.282,0.889,0.2818,0.0039,0.0686,1.5328,0.0849,0.0258,0.1605,0.4229,0.0357,0.0754,0.0947,0.1304,0.154,0.0892,0.5115,0.0099,0.2031,4.7118,0.0182,0.4351,0.2289,0.0833,0.0079,0.0399,0.1134,0.1995,3.1017,1.4027,0.0947,0.1788,0.0018,0.401,0.4954,4.9769,5.1943,1.4775,0.1153,0.317,0.0406,0.0015,0.0247,0.2159,0.0085,0.0098,4.1366,0.0025,5.3934,0.2501,0.056,0.3359,0.513,0.0082,0.0545,0.0237,0.0353,0.0708,0.0344,0.41,0.0056,0.0565,5.9366,0.0033,2.3462,0.4235,0.0873,1.3332,1.1173,2.049,3.0176,6.1974,2.0977,1.1964,2.3328]}

The designation was issued to honor the name, and to indicate that the designation was still being used for that portion of the highway. The designation was initially used to indicate that it was \"owned and operated as a vehicle only\" and had been purchased from M W & N Electric Company, whereupon M and N Electric Company made a formal change. This change was effective until January of 1970, when M W & N merged into the Wisconsin Electric Company. In addition to the designation, the highway was designated under M W & N Electric Company and had previously existed in areas surrounding both locations, which would have been more closely associated with the highway's designation.\n\n\"The M-25 section of the Northridge Highway in Chicago was designated as a separate highway for purposes of this subsection and pursuant to sections 42-A and 42-A-12 of the Wisconsin Public Code.\"\n\n\"We have been concerned about transportation issues in the northbound section of the Northridge Highway, although this appears to be limited to those areas that have been designated as private spaces of interest rather than roads.

Lactarius nusgiata is of a similar variety with Lactarius jymbilus but without the red colour of the flowers.\n\nExternal links\n Australian Lactarius in the National Institute of Zoology.\n Lactarius nusgiata in the National Institute of Zoology\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Species of Lactarius nusgiata in the National Institute of Zoology","token_len":433,"entropy":[10.665,7.8838,2.6716,0.9718,0.9299,9.8094,0.4402,2.4555,3.5052,1.1467,10.2385,7.0639,3.0652,4.2947,6.0626,2.6089,1.1185,5.8868,8.9053,2.0553,7.8099,0.3675,4.1214,6.2773,3.5062,1.1598,1.4183,1.7544,11.7155,12.8092,11.7906,5.7456,7.0141,4.9345,8.9834,0.8643,4.1652,2.034,4.6354,5.1591,0.7249,2.431,5.0883,5.2193,6.1154,8.8856,5.7197,1.3266,4.2576,3.6897,4.7708,1.8259,4.4258,0.8013,5.1963,0.8665,5.2025,0.0024,1.4936,3.0433,0.633,3.3848,0.6437,3.6848,3.8167,2.513,0.0209,4.9693,1.8753,1.7514,1.049,1.0617,6.9571,4.7097,3.4744,3.7954,3.9747,5.3234,5.869,5.2835,1.5115,0.9625,2.9678,6.7132,4.0497,3.6591,0.4075,0.1817,6.3561,3.9328,3.2145,0.5478,5.4827,3.7271,2.6014,2.5054,4.2454,3.9921,2.1158,9.4871,2.7126,1.2766,3.0214,0.6599,3.0229,1.1849,0.2169,1.9221,5.5878,1.9128,2.5278,5.2587,4.3276,2.4892,3.2794,5.1747,1.4591,5.7067,4.6103,0.0353,0.7169,2.1143,1.2133,4.7814,1.5224,1.2247,4.6484,2.7789,5.1359,0.6404,2.6755,3.5506,5.2165,5.0563,1.5008,1.4691,7.4476,5.5989,1.802,0.9831,0.0005,5.8708,2.2366,0.4795,0.6133,0.0946,0.0167,6.9296,1.7252,5.3789,3.4563,1.9987,7.0853,5.0913,4.8245,8.3025,0.6026,1.8142,5.8829,1.2818,0.0017,1.1975,2.6244,0.4398,1.7422,0.0966,2.2791,2.7241,1.8845,0.3449,0.5829,4.2303,1.4195,0.2546,0.4945,5.0977,4.9081,6.3029,2.6849,0.636,3.5116,1.1981,1.8601,2.3329,1.1024,0.0818,0.357,6.1067,5.0021,8.2842,3.022,1.2914,0.5303,0.0042,0.0152,3.1097,1.6467,2.4079,3.9196,3.5234,10.7164,6.8758,3.3469,0.525,0.4127,1.2804,0.2995,0.3781,1.168,4.5367,6.6656,0.4897,0.3677,0.0025,0.0079,3.8373,5.2585,3.3897,1.5583,0.8449,0.266,0.0912,0.0491,0.0161,0.0127,0.7375,0.0586,0.0177,0.0037,0.0539,0.343,0.2841,2.0434,0.1031,0.0038,0.0108,5.611,6.7196,5.6176,7.46,0.5889,0.1646,0.0187,0.0393,0.0062,0.0068,0.1545,0.0211,0.0073,0.0111,0.0275,0.2304,0.1619,2.8527,0.0433,0.0392,2.0718,0.2006,0.0974,2.0564,1.1289,1.6142,4.7414,2.1152,6.8301,1.1355,1.2141,4.0823,5.9621,0.027,0.0024,5.3903,0.7085,0.9984,4.7734,6.4891,3.7207,0.4341,2.271,4.3035,8.7244,1.6955,1.7266,0.5555,4.0884,7.7533,5.9756,1.7354,4.278,0.7401,3.1883,0.0592,0.024,1.1655,0.0182,0.0389,0.0694,2.2409,1.3652,5.2713,2.8062,4.0429,1.7757,1.7775,5.6435,3.7328,5.2536,6.3135,0.8887,2.8116,0.0304,0.022,2.2839,0.0202,0.0076,0.0197,0.6675,1.3704,0.0003,3.8842,0.5362,2.4406,6.2216,6.5725,0.6257,1.1349,5.2022,2.6089,1.9332,2.081,2.1639,2.5376,5.1294,4.0584,2.8901,5.5316,0.0214,1.0695,4.8525,4.1876,5.2371,1.2619,2.3485,4.0474,1.618,1.1302,0.7265,2.2586,0.0359,0.0212,0.9966,0.013,0.015,0.0192,0.9316,5.3408,1.2198,3.0338,4.8986,3.2519,4.5433,0.0447,0.0412,1.5868,0.008,0.0077,0.0099,4.3553,4.1782,0.6848,2.3185,4.3746,2.5262,1.7757,7.5765,1.022,1.5005,0.0003,9.3658,1.5069,0.5605,21.1615,0.6132,0.0192,0.1119,5.3369,1.9122,5.5107,7.6301,0.2442,4.1927,0.038,2.6376,1.0007,14.3148,0.0332,0.0453,1.3329,0.0362,0.0579,0.1072,1.7144,0.9406,1.8158,1.1223,0.0202,0.0131,0.0263,3.4809,0.0007,3.1858,0.6161,0.0006,6.4528,0.4041,4.9954,28.7764,1.6977,0.0698,0.0083,0.0068,2.4993,0.0131,0.0245,0.0569,1.8562,0.9737,1.3909,0.1885,0.0077,0.0042,0.0263]}
{"id":3204,"ended":true,"length":412,"text":"Middlesex is written in the form of a memoir, and switches between the first and the third person in several spots. Used as a comedic device, the third person narratives illustrate Calvin\u2019s experience, his character development and his experiences as a young man. The author describes Calvin as an unlikely, but deeply flawed narrator who seeks to understand his own mortality in the midst of the present moment. The book is set in a country called Pakistan, ruled by Hinduism, with a religious identity that differs from other countries in many respects.\n\nThis novel is written by Ben, a former US diplomat who now works for a French newspaper. He has lived in Pakistan for more than 30 years. One night he got home from a trip to Japan and was met by a Pakistani girl who was very excited to see him. Ben then arranged to move back to the US after school, where she was staying. Ben and the girl were going through a divorce and decided to end their marriage.\n\nBen is in Pakistan to visit her parents, which would have been more than enough. They also planned on visiting the United Kingdom, where he has a girlfriend and a job. A series of visits to the United States that Ben is traveling to is scheduled, but he has been told to stay in Pakistan where his parents are. His flight was delayed and as a result he was unable to make their planned visit as his plane was cancelled. Due to this, Ben missed his flight to the UK and therefore lost his holiday visa.\n\n\u201cMarlish knows for sure what to expect in this book. He finds his inner self in real life and the reader learns about a complex web of personal and professional relationships that makes him a compelling protagonist.\u201d\u2014Karen Brown, Executive Director of the Foundation for American Libraries\n\nBen\u2019s adventures are so well-told that the author is often reminded of the many challenges he has put on his life and career, but the book is full of practicality and humor for the average reader. Whether you are a parent or a parent, be assured that the book is going to be fun and worthwhile for everyone.","token_len":434,"entropy":[11.059,0.6647,3.856,7.0965,0.6717,2.5342,4.3065,0.0482,0.7907,9.7875,1.3023,2.1207,12.1873,1.416,2.1454,5.1836,1.5892,2.2125,3.2023,2.3305,2.5869,4.5322,6.8494,0.6736,10.3155,1.8749,0.6053,7.5565,2.1533,0.4813,1.5519,5.978,0.1858,9.4601,6.9898,10.3955,14.7481,8.026,2.2006,5.249,3.1511,3.1018,5.1766,3.5959,2.0355,1.2664,6.266,1.7066,0.3197,2.9675,0.5219,0.8977,1.9189,5.1674,3.4175,1.0085,1.0112,2.8647,6.618,2.8439,3.0669,5.8508,3.3035,8.0441,1.2561,5.4614,0.99,3.0438,2.2743,1.2924,5.1491,3.2022,1.8984,3.0199,0.0008,2.32,4.9037,2.3537,0.4866,1.9672,2.1381,1.3855,4.4153,0.434,1.5542,5.875,3.4254,8.0623,0.6562,6.9748,0.0521,6.2665,5.3259,1.1708,3.38,1.6206,3.6407,3.5734,1.2628,4.5713,0.8023,4.3026,2.3954,1.3195,2.7933,1.5018,0.3347,2.4942,0.0143,3.8564,2.3765,1.2425,2.9583,1.4563,6.5101,6.1162,1.1393,3.196,5.8224,3.9551,1.0006,3.2343,1.3743,1.378,1.7443,5.2796,3.1699,0.6679,1.6397,2.3446,4.1398,0.2415,2.7807,0.7065,2.8256,0.0061,2.5279,0.0031,1.3849,5.8506,4.0058,2.1027,6.1,4.7587,0.5837,1.4369,2.4739,0.3208,5.1235,1.1442,2.7043,4.3933,0.2096,0.6925,5.0524,3.5473,1.3768,2.1299,4.1999,2.7084,1.2957,1.5391,0.4921,0.4898,1.795,4.758,5.6003,1.0541,8.3658,2.9168,0.2895,1.4906,0.6904,4.2709,5.4413,1.7099,1.472,4.4059,2.183,3.0776,1.1279,2.3253,3.0111,1.9836,0.3266,2.4221,4.6911,2.9599,0.9853,2.805,1.8402,3.953,0.2309,5.2946,0.9569,2.6235,0.8406,2.3437,0.0002,3.4085,2.3811,4.4939,4.1708,1.8393,2.5383,4.092,2.4941,1.4266,4.5368,5.2014,1.8059,0.7078,5.1488,1.6983,1.9802,3.6571,3.263,4.3684,4.1302,2.2901,3.2456,2.1294,3.4877,3.1921,1.2164,1.1329,1.5544,3.0604,2.4486,3.7786,1.5265,1.9286,3.0359,0.732,4.7109,5.3386,0.0059,4.3215,1.3818,1.3527,1.8993,0.3071,5.6436,3.4985,2.881,6.6518,1.3857,3.2069,4.2344,2.7918,1.2015,1.2838,2.4282,2.649,2.526,1.8671,1.6056,1.2234,2.4443,5.4676,2.8395,2.3356,1.1819,2.0484,4.0648,5.7872,4.7352,1.1133,2.4515,6.0833,0.8636,0.128,1.5144,1.5955,1.4887,0.0027,2.0591,7.6772,5.2533,2.6119,4.6742,3.7959,3.6587,0.9439,3.8327,0.5887,6.2965,0.0025,1.8267,0.5587,1.0464,7.2203,0.8927,1.2891,1.2287,1.5064,2.0553,1.3925,5.2309,4.6396,0.5614,7.8688,2.2791,0.4148,1.0484,0.0002,6.0926,6.9186,10.1578,14.8243,10.255,6.3597,1.0409,2.9101,3.7366,0.7721,1.9349,1.2295,1.5542,0.5001,1.8642,5.3272,2.9725,6.1879,3.9724,1.6716,8.1276,0.5,1.588,3.3537,4.2995,3.5466,1.4613,3.8997,5.5044,5.8561,0.0693,3.7586,1.733,1.4014,0.5385,1.661,4.9722,1.2471,1.8603,5.0991,2.9704,0.3886,5.9503,5.6951,8.0277,5.7316,2.3245,4.972,1.815,5.4005,1.6584,1.049,1.5821,4.677,0.1602,3.2565,5.0286,1.1249,0.0002,7.5597,4.1999,0.1182,0.1465,5.892,1.6578,5.0851,3.3891,1.3875,1.6539,0.9038,2.1949,2.1089,2.6592,3.5771,5.1975,0.2686,1.5148,4.2044,5.2888,1.4516,2.3513,5.9211,4.9929,2.7612,1.1975,2.567,4.0556,2.478,2.7717,2.7331,1.7746,1.0075,3.9996,0.0106,5.6755,4.6405,0.5433,2.7978,5.2177,1.7025,3.1112,0.4259,0.2589,6.0474,1.6498,0.9622,1.0796,5.0751,0.9758,0.8131,5.5295,3.8591,6.3863,4.2306,0.3257,1.5393,1.5628,0.8555,4.7888,0.0298,1.5247,3.4442,1.203,6.3039,1.5991,3.1354,0.6309]}

It has received significant amounts of demand from various online gaming channels, including the Canadian Premier League and NHL games, both of which currently use Canada-English.\n\nThe channel has been known to have a number of controversies in recent years, including a video criticism series called \"Canada-Honey\", in which Canadian and Canadian teenagers, particularly, have been accused of being against one another and \"hiding from Canadian values \". In 2011, a video was filmed in an elementary School in British Columbia that was titled \"Canada-\" by \"Canada-Honey\". It aired on television in English and German and was later broadcast on television in French. During its first weekend of operation in Canada, the video was watched at approximately 30 million viewers. The video was a popular web video site by the public and went viral on the Internet.

Recent studies show that the COVID-19 outbreak has forced companies to drastically halt their drilling plans.","token_len":434,"entropy":[8.6648,3.5662,2.6039,5.1466,7.2571,14.281,6.9793,4.6902,9.7774,10.1518,11.6923,1.0651,7.6156,1.2613,6.7998,8.2715,2.8818,6.4652,11.8947,1.3424,3.7041,6.5039,4.862,1.4543,0.3929,7.9346,5.5039,8.4814,5.8865,5.2533,6.6283,5.8068,4.9839,3.5449,2.3865,3.8409,1.457,4.2617,2.0039,2.4678,5.7849,5.9216,1.1711,2.6211,3.474,0.7656,6.0293,1.6816,6.5746,3.1222,5.0707,0.522,0.961,0.4369,0.0023,4.971,0.3708,4.9761,2.9691,4.8854,0.8218,5.4874,5.3514,5.5339,2.6608,1.3843,1.335,5.0204,1.0571,0.0037,0.3318,1.9241,0.728,2.2323,0.6273,2.7688,4.8483,4.9667,4.1001,1.1553,3.2515,1.6612,0.6591,3.804,0.6934,2.4885,0.5519,2.7749,2.8933,0.1327,2.0333,4.1002,0.416,4.3623,0.5636,1.4252,0.0218,3.2179,2.4844,1.102,0.7453,2.4466,2.9232,0.6362,0.9287,2.1433,2.7569,6.2002,4.2459,0.0041,5.1313,6.261,2.7655,3.0609,1.3317,0.5699,5.1557,6.169,4.1622,4.7281,5.0287,3.9379,2.928,3.555,3.0008,3.7662,3.7396,5.798,3.895,0.0316,1.531,0.8185,0.0002,1.193,2.2117,1.0624,5.688,1.8645,2.4203,5.354,4.1323,4.6892,9.8522,3.6811,13.6938,8.6756,2.464,6.4623,0.6698,0.7457,3.5998,2.3225,2.5916,3.3314,1.4858,3.4094,3.6428,1.7041,2.0496,0.8967,5.7954,0.0132,1.129,2.4915,0.725,1.4733,0.2126,0.0017,3.7952,2.4874,4.5355,5.2279,4.4549,1.6247,0.6988,0.0129,1.9045,4.7809,1.2508,0.0335,2.4157,0.7503,3.3902,5.8723,1.0312,2.2616,3.7008,0.0002,2.6664,2.3749,1.1727,5.4789,0.7851,0.0035,1.0327,9.5991,2.9052,0.8455,0.4401,0.0003,7.4748,1.0882,5.5169,6.7402,2.3699,4.7521,1.7419,7.3607,1.0574,3.3078,0.384,1.4582,0.1006,0.1174,3.2234,0.9421,6.2769,7.5578,8.2297,4.1698,2.2626,5.3449,2.5371,1.4017,2.5195,0.1493,0.1538,1.7685,3.4483,2.6181,3.5345,0.7195,7.6061,3.7153,3.5642,2.552,1.0465,2.3471,1.2121,4.3231,4.9156,1.0952,4.1479,9.4911,1.0378,8.1842,1.161,0.2496,3.2039,5.0106,1.2405,1.01,3.7462,0.3487,2.8145,1.0533,0.8188,3.4186,0.5827,2.0153,0.5417,1.3329,0.0002,3.4963,0.2753,2.5273,0.1918,3.2405,3.0648,0.9776,7.1292,2.5788,0.9901,0.9393,3.6944,1.5067,2.6427,7.147,0.742,0.5573,3.2988,5.232,4.7936,13.0096,0.284,0.0957,1.9309,2.3929,0.5056,4.0804,3.2794,0.6976,2.2419,1.617,2.8838,5.0969,4.537,5.5192,2.6522,3.3996,2.8178,0.4165,1.5523,0.3795,5.5917,1.6852,3.9375,3.9877,3.6736,2.783,1.082,0.6568,0.0002,1.9608,0.0112,4.1052,4.5631,0.9737,5.5071,4.5271,5.8302,3.6642,4.2329,0.727,1.0833,6.4557,1.9909,5.6778,1.9521,6.8834,5.0873,1.8127,6.2556,2.1598,6.188,1.5007,4.6331,3.0586,6.8945,2.6553,1.3919,1.3609,5.7388,0.3726,0.0003,5.9329,0.6976,5.3859,7.5742,17.1879,4.6459,6.5903,11.2874,0.5637,1.5992,4.6168,2.7315,4.1485,2.6995,3.5856,4.3137,0.057,2.3363,3.2327,2.2073,1.84,4.3589,3.8841,1.5368,0.9035,0.0002,4.8599,4.5445,5.0321,2.0544,1.5856,4.6017,0.0463,3.5143,3.3285,0.7823,0.0387,6.5524,3.9689,1.9635,5.0385,6.5595,2.6024,4.3619,4.5113,0.2574,3.7546,3.6283,2.9119,1.6941,3.0338,3.4285,0.63,0.0535,4.7303,5.449,2.7383,3.825,2.961,7.414,1.8861,5.32,0.8957,3.2932,2.7435,7.7722,1.5606,0.455,7.8465,3.8795,2.4443,0.3381,1.763,5.0352,0.058,0.4952,0.1033,0.4374,1.3418,5.6316,4.1638,0.4073,6.1205,9.5457,1.9891,3.6011,4.7408,1.5024]}

I got this CD out the mail yesterday for $13 as well.\n\nIt's been 2 months since my last post. I wanted to share this post because I recently bought the disc on Blu-ray. I ordered a few hundred copies, hoping to get something for my parents, but they didn't have anything to offer. My mom has never seen the box, but a few years ago her dad bought her this DVD. I hope that she finds it handy. There are tons of DVDs out there...\n\nIt's too soon to say if anything will come of this gift. But from what I've heard there are rumors that the disc will be available for download via Amazon. I'm planning to get this for the first time this spring... I won't know what else to do... I'll be keeping tabs on this post.","token_len":435,"entropy":[12.0073,3.6331,9.5703,3.7336,9.8327,4.6643,0.185,1.6167,9.2529,1.9416,1.2403,1.9099,8.1565,5.2161,5.8171,10.0188,3.3437,0.1319,4.9915,6.9831,4.0767,4.7975,4.1839,0.8902,0.0252,0.1539,0.0576,4.3646,2.2783,0.0072,0.4712,0.135,1.2661,4.5444,1.1187,3.7116,3.2566,1.88,11.9964,8.2138,9.6655,2.6912,0.9538,3.0789,1.1651,6.5385,1.7217,2.1674,3.4716,1.4535,3.0984,0.0064,7.0536,1.2889,4.9977,6.8092,5.3485,4.3863,3.275,2.9836,1.9146,2.5253,4.0923,0.2124,0.0012,2.029,0.9533,1.5564,4.9347,6.3837,1.4231,4.2687,0.8007,1.9453,4.3089,0.7139,0.3669,9.3676,4.4471,5.4877,1.4179,3.6172,0.4184,0.8654,6.4925,0.9636,1.6263,2.0795,5.9773,1.1543,1.0439,1.9881,1.3822,2.8941,3.7592,2.7758,1.851,0.6878,0.8559,2.9053,6.7328,1.2878,3.4477,5.7153,1.8591,1.7434,1.1292,2.2222,1.0843,8.0036,1.0163,0.0003,0.6632,2.904,0.0629,1.7899,6.69,6.2678,3.2587,4.7135,4.8449,2.6764,1.1153,0.0675,4.0946,4.6996,4.6791,1.1474,5.4049,0.5989,0.3022,0.5418,1.6922,2.3161,0.062,0.0032,0.0004,0.0,0.1186,0.0398,0.0094,0.1139,0.459,2.8153,0.0034,0.0037,0.0016,0.4173,0.0055,0.0001,0.013,0.0074,0.1165,0.0224,0.0018,0.039,0.027,0.0024,0.0607,0.0969,0.002,0.0138,0.0006,0.0016,0.0021,0.0147,0.001,0.0024,0.0008,0.0036,0.0062,0.0053,0.0006,0.0023,0.0031,0.2935,0.0487,0.0025,0.0022,0.0015,0.0057,0.0048,0.0003,0.0004,0.001,0.0014,0.0031,0.0053,9.7391,5.3055,0.0003,0.0013,0.003,0.0013,0.0006,0.0039,0.0029,0.0015,2.3577,1.3611,4.5341,1.1563,0.1619,0.1693,0.693,4.3342,6.1366,0.9115,3.6122,4.6604,0.114,7.8628,4.0707,3.9827,1.7225,1.6271,0.9921,0.0018,0.0541,0.0424,0.8052,0.9887,0.6503,1.1792,1.5571,2.0716,3.4264,0.1649,0.0187,0.5463,0.7576,0.0642,1.549,0.8712,0.3411,0.1852,0.3334,0.1075,0.4105,0.013,0.0324,0.0066,0.0007,0.01,0.0076,0.0172,0.003,0.0162,0.0188,0.0006,0.0072,0.8439,0.0001,1.2118,2.1769,0.0185,0.0245,0.0069,7.1297,0.0002,6.1554,2.7214,0.6112,0.401,2.6663,4.7244,2.0579,6.4483,2.3843,4.7502,5.027,2.5441,4.8405,3.0202,4.5333,6.1791,3.1685,0.8929,2.8793,0.0004,4.722,0.8091,3.0825,5.9048,2.5003,0.4142,3.078,0.629,4.0836,1.811,1.6232,4.9725,0.2082,2.231,1.7789,3.7922,2.7706,0.8346,5.878,3.5336,2.5041,4.7986,3.2889,5.6566,0.1082,0.2816,2.1653,1.1838,4.9731,2.2928,3.5139,5.2006,1.0349,2.2685,5.9202,0.8642,1.1922,4.4823,2.1941,1.7521,4.4151,2.2683,1.0783,2.6568,2.6034,0.0017,2.0866,3.0401,2.219,2.7684,0.6851,3.703,2.7315,3.5868,3.525,3.0103,2.0746,5.705,1.2806,2.1479,5.8761,2.039,3.1869,0.1524,4.4068,3.1028,2.0325,1.9649,3.7065,3.1645,1.561,1.5699,5.169,2.3212,2.0262,3.5867,0.78,5.4668,1.217,5.2929,1.2602,4.9187,0.052,4.3755,0.588,0.0287,5.8488,2.5659,0.0004,4.5327,0.4143,7.9191,4.4166,0.138,1.4864,1.4854,5.1202,1.445,2.4666,1.3005,0.7294,6.7602,1.326,2.5797,5.7038,0.7042,0.0441,1.0236,1.4773,5.2396,1.271,4.6658,0.7958,1.7382,2.5197,1.1487,0.7052,3.5798,1.2985,3.894,4.8843,2.3417,1.0844,2.0461,1.924,5.691,1.2829,2.965,2.6259,3.3816,3.3561,2.4033,0.0714,2.5859,3.9086,3.9577,2.6526,5.4812,0.0025,2.3444,2.9682,3.9021,0.5613,1.2256,3.995,2.2613,2.0009,2.2969,4.5873,4.7109,0.0938,1.853,3.8018,1.2576]}

{"id":4282,"ended":false,"length":411,"text":"Mouton broke off her contract with Audi in late 1985 to join Peugeot for the coming season. She contested the German Rally Championship and two WRC events in a Peugeot 205 Turbo 16, which took her to the podium. The first car she competed in was a 250-cc, twinturbocharged, 4.0L two-stroke engine in a Porsche 911 GT2 RS Sport. \"I really thought [i] had an opportunity to go back to the world we came from. And because of that, it was great to see the world finally make sense for me,\" said the British female racer and five-time European Rally champion. \"But I decided to keep going. And I did. I think I was always doing the right thing. It was very exciting. I wanted to be on the podium to see people really take me to new parts.\"\n\nAfter a disappointing debut in 1985, the former British champion was forced to withdraw from the championship.\n\n\"It is something I will never forget in my whole life. It was really tough, going from being in the top 10 all the way to that day, with a great performance,\" she said. \"And I wanted to try to do my best in the Rally and I always wanted to win it. There is a special place where you want to go, but you don't have that feeling. I always wanted to get to that level. If it didn't work out at all, you can always try out again and see what happens.\"\n\nShe finished third on last season's Rally for Performance of the Year in Barcelona. Since then, she has won twice, both times in the European Rally Championship. Mouton said the best part of 2017 is that it has now come true. \"I was in a little bit of a down time, it was too soon.

I would give myself to do a third play in my life where the main characters had to learn what they want to and work to make that happen. \"We wanted to give as little as possible to the young men and women in the audience that was important to them.\"\n\nIn his 'Breadcrumb of Things' he says of the original version of Bulldog Drummond that : \"The characters are quite strong but they're quite small. \"The story is also well written. \"It's not too far from reality but at the same time we always felt there was a danger in the characters having to play characters who would not be able to fit in. \"For me this made a huge difference. \"'A lot of these stories have a sense of'my little boy has a crush on you,' but we really want to see what can be achieved. \"We're happy that with the help of all of the support of the producers we were able to deliver a really great piece of work.\" - Robert MacHulston.","token_len":436,"entropy":[9.3845,5.9745,4.3552,8.0077,9.535,3.8709,0.1121,10.3374,1.3302,4.4464,2.0906,1.8071,9.7006,3.7834,11.1796,4.0385,5.3353,1.2338,3.9778,1.1638,3.9636,1.7673,0.9363,3.5759,1.9518,10.252,0.7566,0.0101,2.7494,2.4007,5.3617,0.602,8.6226,7.9438,4.7246,3.4377,0.9863,10.9765,0.0017,0.0004,4.3154,1.4694,4.9169,5.4301,2.0262,6.4152,0.905,5.8914,2.3807,1.2298,3.2336,4.0679,3.7139,2.3371,2.0263,6.274,0.1046,0.9233,4.6071,3.3833,4.6165,2.7908,2.4792,3.1809,1.3883,1.9618,4.2443,2.2261,2.7453,4.6998,1.5178,2.1066,5.6662,1.9074,1.7873,3.6262,6.8456,3.4231,3.0814,1.46,4.424,3.7461,2.6227,1.222,2.681,5.3806,0.1238,3.6145,1.8088,1.6851,3.9474,2.9603,4.0483,2.2896,2.6072,1.6657,3.7559,5.6299,1.5384,4.8897,4.3057,2.8413,5.6756,2.5805,6.0679,2.4447,4.5107,2.071,4.6716,6.1617,1.8478,1.9485,1.2467,3.4665,3.7567,2.7551,4.5978,1.0828,5.0779,3.7705,2.6818,4.2352,1.5028,4.4501,0.5504,1.1699,0.3072,1.1591,0.615,5.001,6.4348,2.3836,1.7899,4.5835,4.1903,0.2273,1.8659,4.1427,5.0781,0.1536,1.6055,0.6945,4.3964,1.5542,5.0607,5.2092,3.959,1.4139,5.0869,1.8677,3.7794,1.5759,0.2207,4.1764,4.9114,3.7145,0.4349,3.5192,6.6566,2.9228,2.8675,0.5578,3.46,3.0674,1.1492,3.7585,1.982,1.2496,4.193,4.5182,5.0819,0.3369,2.3013,5.446,0.7462,2.0137,1.2805,0.5056,2.1351,6.2787,2.8735,3.8638,3.6209,2.258,0.6833,0.2281,5.2347,1.0253,4.5115,6.4115,2.4829,3.6431,1.9882,2.8705,0.482,0.7794,1.28,2.677,5.094,0.6333,3.1057,6.5374,4.6458,4.7297,0.1452,3.0631,3.6073,1.3115,3.6874,2.2401,5.4606,1.9217,1.1127,0.2455,2.4054,5.6646,0.5167,2.7575,5.5194,2.1162,0.0006,5.0081,1.7903,0.2968,2.0286,4.2441,3.9864,4.7741,6.1333,4.2467,4.2523,2.1349,4.9724,2.8775,2.9709,4.0568,2.8002,4.4139,2.4366,3.6157,1.7853,3.3396,1.4894,4.0695,3.5759,1.9481,4.8401,0.5648,6.7723,6.0257,2.6501,2.825,1.9925,0.4924,0.3921,0.2685,2.029,2.8725,0.5036,2.8704,6.0933,3.8732,1.7617,0.0513,0.6616,0.8138,1.9112,1.739,0.257,0.0499,2.3284,1.508,1.761,4.0159,5.1033,5.5487,0.6736,0.4317,2.5608,1.6055,0.0009,4.11,3.8119,5.9124,5.1397,5.1925,4.2973,1.9331,3.2483,7.8011,1.8088,2.9841,3.0663,3.8027,1.2121,4.509,3.6123,0.7904,1.8646,0.0116,0.7503,0.0004,3.1883,8.0294,0.2483,2.1251,4.8355,2.3693,4.435,4.9776,3.1137,1.9412,2.3703,4.2301,3.6283,0.9776,1.8255,2.2374,2.5538,1.0975,4.8146,4.9165,0.8242,1.3465,1.4456,2.0028,0.7552,2.2103,3.627,4.4009,1.0642,5.5879,2.2114,4.6626,0.6416,0.2722,0.0073,2.3154,4.9534,2.6561,2.8301,0.673,1.1649,3.6086,1.7909,2.7082,3.9619,4.4013,1.5647,4.9386,5.2439,1.6274,3.539,2.2706,1.2052,1.8705,0.0167,4.7216,0.9783,1.8163,0.2417,4.6066,1.9794,3.2808,4.5444,2.4441,1.9244,0.1488,1.1311,7.4958,4.6138,3.4268,0.0708,4.3916,3.1394,2.458,2.3556,3.9368,0.0218,15.2253,8.0963,6.4984,4.8984,8.1888,2.3334,6.1964,0.1049,5.5853,4.0325,5.8011,2.8595,4.1496,4.0379,0.716,4.013,2.7583,4.6826,1.2669,1.6963,2.6132,0.2721,1.9301,3.3309,4.1048,2.0524,4.7578,1.4127,4.1289,0.0462,5.2282,2.3971,0.8524,7.166,1.8762,0.8688,4.8759,1.4058,2.5121,0.0105,0.0056,4.494,1.7574,4.1685,2.2949,2.9815,0.2361,2.0119,1.9002,5.9843,5.2926,4.8421,7.0532,6.9807,7.1495,3.9377]}

Sheffield scored 12 goals on the pitch between 2001 & 2004, winning a record three Premier League titles, including a double in 1999, while being a two time UEFA Super League Grand Final Champion. He was also a semi-finalist at Euro 2008 for Wales (1996 & 1999) and was not banned from the England squad for his role in the controversial FIFA incident in Russia 2009. He retired from the sport at the end of 2009.\n\nHis personal trainer, Tony Totten, said Woodhouse \"was a lovely man and a man who always kept himself on good terms with his wife and his two young children as he battled his fair share of illnesses\" but that he has \"saved a great deal of money\" with his retirement.\n\nThe 24-year-old admitted that he was \"extremely disappointed by\" his personal trainer's assessment of both men, describing them as \"a lot of chaps I've been known to respect\" before the retirement announcement.\n\nTotten said: \"I have to add and correct that in hindsight I was disappointed with the way he responded to the treatment and the advice I got.\n\n\"That was a shame as well I thought I'd be an awesome trainer forever and I would have been happy with the outcome.\n\n\"I know there's a lot of other people who've known who got married last night, but I didn't realise they had kids.\n\n\"I had to make the hard decisions about both myself and a few close friends. I've been struggling to get used to it and now it's taken me a while to figure out why this was happening.\n\n\"At the end of the day it was a huge gift for my wife and kids. I think she'll be really proud.\n\n\"There's always times I give someone my time, but this one was amazing.\"\n\nWoodhouse won just 10 matches for the Whites between 2002 and 2008, averaging just four goals per game.","token_len":436,"entropy":[7.7998,8.6907,3.2406,7.0168,0.1274,1.0637,7.556,4.349,3.209,8.662,3.2631,3.4012,2.0944,3.9523,1.4356,3.2667,3.1222,4.2117,0.1272,4.2219,0.3943,2.956,3.6873,2.898,10.2002,1.9553,0.5892,0.1962,12.963,15.5151,6.5744,4.8229,8.3451,1.4387,7.8092,7.4541,4.5655,0.3729,5.6237,1.8812,2.9886,4.6754,3.7536,4.2488,1.8482,0.8303,3.3474,3.0232,3.8579,4.3503,2.3248,0.0243,0.1647,1.9163,2.3391,1.8246,4.4327,0.8296,3.8832,1.9116,3.3713,3.9251,3.9996,4.7759,3.8587,5.4677,3.4454,4.3282,6.5918,0.7024,5.3512,0.5705,1.7423,1.9611,1.8225,1.7676,5.1235,0.0385,0.3719,0.02,1.6282,4.9214,2.6052,4.8475,6.1711,4.3788,5.9875,2.6238,2.7694,0.8859,0.4554,2.1422,6.4197,6.5322,1.4891,1.3007,3.7817,0.7727,0.9092,2.8745,2.759,0.1105,0.8559,6.1885,5.6968,4.7926,1.8268,5.958,7.5273,0.4272,2.0501,3.907,0.5933,1.8897,2.5893,2.6476,0.1125,0.5977,0.0017,2.8924,1.2839,0.7577,0.0029,4.5136,5.9596,3.8675,1.1483,4.9991,5.4223,6.7078,0.2689,1.9014,8.6398,0.0184,3.1975,2.2848,1.3633,5.5655,2.0086,1.7996,1.5178,3.5852,1.2768,2.9576,3.7803,3.0269,3.624,3.8983,0.0732,0.5207,0.6,2.8908,0.7921,3.5287,3.6176,1.6598,0.3125,5.2535,1.66,5.5885,2.5513,6.3924,0.0024,0.0123,3.7507,3.2711,3.4182,2.3684,1.2022,4.2045,1.7572,5.348,1.6881,1.1794,1.9575,0.0763,0.2452,2.8667,1.41,3.1087,0.7441,4.0792,0.4891,0.6978,0.0004,2.9125,5.1357,0.159,0.0112,0.0048,0.001,5.6623,1.6921,0.8084,1.9295,1.2535,4.6888,2.1685,4.3841,3.2453,1.4596,6.0899,2.2099,0.5336,4.5904,1.312,7.6474,4.6909,1.4353,4.3971,1.1329,0.1462,0.1896,3.1148,4.1588,0.699,6.0942,2.5423,7.4669,2.1574,3.6455,5.1377,0.0832,6.3336,2.1485,4.0593,2.1603,4.9646,2.637,0.4076,0.5406,0.0004,3.273,0.0049,1.1412,0.5977,0.0086,1.9855,3.2312,2.5241,5.1806,7.6603,3.7533,1.5933,4.4454,3.8031,1.691,2.1474,3.9381,2.2233,1.7141,2.0659,1.47,4.9548,0.3688,1.8104,7.0045,3.1581,1.8093,5.4883,2.8536,2.8009,1.9091,1.1134,0.0003,0.0481,4.9198,1.812,1.9817,5.2179,2.5414,4.6002,5.9572,3.9818,2.8879,1.8773,2.3757,5.3153,5.5929,3.3276,7.7622,1.5529,1.5307,3.0764,1.4521,1.5838,2.2241,2.3779,1.9146,2.537,1.5186,0.8816,0.0002,0.0598,1.4246,3.6759,3.4028,1.7549,1.0134,0.628,0.241,4.6205,1.3096,1.2125,3.2968,6.8036,7.4422,5.7114,7.5199,5.9143,2.4909,1.9789,1.0925,1.1649,3.2337,0.0003,3.6945,3.1692,2.5735,3.0244,1.6297,1.1276,0.0002,0.0496,1.2145,3.7763,1.6752,3.3336,2.1465,4.5147,2.4406,3.27,5.8817,3.7033,0.099,5.6845,2.9061,5.8189,0.2323,1.9623,1.1983,2.6057,2.1899,5.76,1.5373,2.0252,4.4063,0.0059,2.0798,1.5815,3.2909,1.8327,0.23,5.1568,1.3391,0.7523,0.8829,0.3817,3.7592,0.713,3.3528,4.6699,2.5356,2.2967,1.0938,0.2918,0.0002,0.0645,5.0059,0.4549,0.7821,0.0627,0.0679,0.0045,1.6918,1.0824,1.6933,3.652,6.2176,1.8464,2.2248,1.3802,0.5456,2.7371,1.7337,1.444,3.7952,2.1722,2.8106,0.7445,3.5709,1.7089,3.2057,0.8689,0.0002,0.0631,4.2084,0.758,2.7886,7.4606,3.1499,5.9501,4.9988,4.9388,3.7648,1.6366,1.2391,3.2212,2.5034,1.1432,5.4423,1.8774,0.6395,0.0002,0.5991,0.0036,5.174,5.8203,4.0941,5.017,1.1353,2.0402,6.5038,4.2391,2.9073,2.0046,2.2999,0.6219,5.6147,1.6068,3.9622,0.5136,1.8066,0.5618,0.9548]}

He also won the Drama Desk and Drama Academy Awards. He died at the age of 91.\n\nHis son and daughter both became theater actors in their prime.\n\nHis daughter said that her mom always kept the younger son entertained, and her dad was a great actor who was very generous to them. \"He was one of his very best pals at a young age. He really pushed a lot of people to go out on screen, and I don't think you expect him and his siblings to do that, and I think they would have been more happy in their home.\"\n\nHis father was a big star in his own right, and has had some success directing films, some of which have been released in theater. In the early 1980s, Olivier went to see his father in the movie, The Golden Girls. His father was a director and his mother an actress.\n\nHe worked extensively in movies, although at the same time he was very active on the television and film industries. For example, he made Star Trek, Star Wars and Sherlock Holmes.\n\nOlivier served as the film editor of both Master-Filmmaker and the Master-Creator magazine.\n\n\"He was always involved with the casting and costume of any major film,\" said Annie Kiefer, head of casting for the film. \"He was an accomplished actor who was a great inspiration to many of our actors.\"\n\nOlivier also served as an honorary member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Barbara, his stepbrother, John (Jean), and his sister Nancy.","token_len":436,"entropy":[12.8635,7.6257,13.3307,4.2255,4.721,7.5254,0.5723,11.8242,7.7945,2.5806,1.3985,7.1139,3.7474,3.6989,10.3924,2.1881,5.5341,0.0474,1.0789,7.4726,1.4774,11.2708,4.1459,9.8478,6.7517,2.4028,1.286,1.3055,7.3114,0.5147,7.3003,0.8113,3.6127,6.2853,7.5179,2.3593,1.6654,1.836,1.7434,2.2584,2.4698,1.7078,3.8499,1.9082,2.6561,4.4402,1.2592,4.1158,4.5246,1.7267,3.4844,4.765,1.437,5.1739,3.3737,1.6761,3.2261,0.1453,3.5383,4.1958,4.1085,2.2684,2.4977,3.3236,2.0167,0.6475,0.9914,0.0042,3.2555,3.5873,2.7516,1.5004,5.4106,1.4052,5.8225,8.846,2.0107,2.8103,2.8973,2.7386,0.1515,2.8442,1.1177,1.0514,1.0078,2.3264,0.0295,2.0752,4.4663,7.3835,1.5889,1.8818,5.3523,3.2766,0.1884,1.5201,1.3067,0.026,1.2784,0.6151,1.5812,1.3484,2.1294,1.7685,1.9266,1.7613,7.2466,1.3377,4.7201,2.6514,6.928,1.1181,2.1457,2.0019,3.0889,2.4304,1.4707,0.0334,0.0171,3.2711,1.6218,0.3303,0.0002,3.2572,3.3331,4.5412,2.3061,4.7504,4.7895,6.8468,3.5262,2.2839,2.2341,5.4124,0.7901,1.761,0.0002,3.223,3.0259,5.0341,1.7432,3.2709,5.3185,3.1908,4.0484,3.5448,5.7663,3.9079,4.4338,1.7218,1.4898,3.8323,2.7813,1.9436,1.9876,2.4476,2.2654,2.9554,2.1741,3.28,4.3498,2.551,4.3376,0.4959,3.9401,1.0103,1.0087,3.9686,0.049,6.2747,4.1323,1.5766,7.2027,4.559,3.847,3.0615,0.0007,2.2241,0.7933,4.5347,5.2448,4.7075,0.2057,0.1149,2.1301,1.0358,3.5218,1.2694,3.483,6.8309,1.9025,0.8086,2.7298,3.7719,0.0009,0.4158,3.3968,7.4712,1.6151,5.6756,0.9965,5.0614,0.1578,1.4665,0.4482,3.1939,3.1023,1.3679,0.9437,2.0819,2.7671,1.0485,1.4697,3.563,2.7627,3.1987,1.0892,5.3718,2.6497,0.243,0.0002,2.7611,2.825,1.6343,1.3654,3.822,4.3875,0.8687,1.9778,0.5224,0.0302,0.781,1.495,4.6341,3.6447,3.136,2.856,5.2573,2.1831,2.4081,6.2325,0.6217,0.215,1.0961,1.126,3.653,1.7839,7.4439,0.8438,3.2424,2.5901,1.8313,2.1881,0.1727,0.2333,2.9249,4.7145,0.7581,3.0316,2.8788,1.6165,2.0305,1.9122,3.2674,3.2857,2.6249,5.8026,3.2138,1.5805,3.4128,1.0389,1.745,2.0962,4.4692,1.9409,5.0866,1.7659,3.311,0.4985,0.6135,0.6863,0.0002,2.263,4.4173,4.9151,1.6413,4.2704,1.4437,6.0236,5.2407,1.2119,3.3364,0.0021,0.779,1.2094,3.4711,3.2316,2.0665,1.5744,3.9826,2.6142,1.739,3.321,0.3641,5.0033,0.9266,0.1101,0.8631,3.5288,6.8189,0.7437,2.7283,3.3341,0.8528,1.3564,6.1221,1.0388,1.4399,1.041,0.0002,4.2907,0.0184,0.0023,6.1417,0.8648,2.0262,4.8326,2.307,1.779,4.9875,8.7378,6.6363,5.4562,1.675,0.0798,0.46,2.9237,5.0965,0.7854,6.3142,0.5866,3.1174,0.7195,1.5234,0.0002,3.9621,1.6099,0.7029,3.3869,3.9974,1.3853,1.4439,4.8766,1.6163,6.237,3.8264,5.1509,5.1065,1.6414,2.383,0.9187,6.6206,4.4351,5.6605,0.0806,1.2374,5.9616,0.1551,4.3198,1.1566,1.4485,2.5213,1.0416,0.2398,0.6765,0.8285,2.8524,5.7425,1.7004,2.0135,1.6842,2.515,2.0215,4.5977,0.6885,1.876,1.4868,2.0994,3.3114,1.5533,0.1487,0.0002,2.088,0.004,0.0016,2.6585,3.9724,0.2408,2.4305,4.7479,1.4984,0.0406,0.2068,2.5028,0.4211,0.0614,0.0383,0.0055,0.0983,0.0016,1.1223,0.9059,0.0002,2.1698,3.1124,0.0697,0.0016,0.145,0.2347,0.8272,4.2819,0.7045,2.4053,5.2918,4.164,0.5527,4.3801,4.7092,5.9415,1.9212,2.393,0.9852,2.3483,5.8759,1.1426]}
{"id":4606,"ended":false,"length":399,"text":"In August 1941, Rowell returned to Australia to take up the post of Deputy Chief of the General Staff ( DCGS ), with the rank of major general. He expected that his new post would be the last one held by the Government of the Commonwealth of New South Wales, and it was his decision, while being a resident of New South Wales, to leave the State in an attempt \"to secure a good employment\". During World War II, Rowell was stationed with the 8th American Air Forces in Australia and New Guinea, where he later became chief pilot for the 9-1 Flying Fortress, and as an active pilot of 3-4 Flying Fortress, flying two MiG-28's in Australia and the United States.\n\nPrior to the defeat of the Spanish Civil War in 1943, Rowell was stationed with the United States Department of the Air Force, at Quantico, Virginia. He was a \"starchitect\", who developed a unique design that was intended for the United States and had to be manufactured in small quantities. He was also very fond of the \"A\" word \"M\" and \"B\". The \"A\" word was a derogatory expression for \"fishing\". During World War II, Rowell was deployed with the 8th American Air Forces to Okinawa; however, this deployment was short-lived. He returned as a civilian pilot early in the next war. In 1942, Rowell flew a MiG-11 F\/A\/C ( Manned Aerial Force ) and served as an Air Force officer from 1943 to 1943, serving with the 9th US Air Forces during Operation Protective Edge.

Sebastian Vettel took his sixth pole position of the season \u2013 second best in the world \u2013 while Lewis Hamilton finished a close second in the championship.\n\nFernando Alonso is a two time world champion in the Mercedes, so having the race turned into the opening year did not cause any doubt of the overall performance of the team. The Mercedes team has achieved a significant amount of technical achievements during the 2016 season and has now become one of the fastest cars on the Formula One calendar.\n\nOn one occasion, the Vettel team achieved an impressive 0-3 win against McLaren teammate Charles Leclerc but had to turn around and take place in the McLaren. With all those special qualities, the team is in excellent condition and its current position should provide the conditions to further improve the performance of the team for years to come.\n\nSebastian Vettel is not in contention for the pole position at the Mercedes, due to his lack of a full season of service to his Mercedes team. He has won nine of the last 11 Formula One world championships, all in his career. He has been on a hot streak in recent months, scoring two consecutive top ten finishes.\n\nHowever, he has been suffering in the last few weeks from an illness. In addition to this, the team has experienced technical issues, including the car that he replaced and the one that he replaced.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only our team which has had to deal with technical issues, but also the cars that we have,\u201d said Mclaren driver. \u201cWe have had a lot of the teams affected and we have to continue to monitor them.

This is the second biggest tax hike that has come under opposition in the last two decades. The hike to non-residents of the state is part of the government government's efforts to provide free health care to a population of less than 2 crore that also includes the underdeveloped sector in the state.\nIn 2018, the UPA government had announced its commitment to provide food to every household in the state by offering free birth control, with a price tag of Rs 10 or Rs 12 per contraceptive use, to all domestic couples in the state. It announced the state-wide food stamp support scheme (FPDS). The Panchayat Scheme has been announced in February 2020 under PM Rajan, an effort to ensure that the provision of food to the poor is not limited to those who have difficulty maintaining their food requirements.\nThe government has also decided to introduce five new districts of the state, where families with fewer than one children will be eligible and free education provided to children of the upper classes. With the Uttar Pradesh election in March 2020, the minister of agriculture and rural development Saikat Singh Khosla promised to raise the minimum support price (MSP) of grains to Rs 50 per quintal from Rs 31 in the next one lakh children.\nThe minister stated that the UP government was also planning to introduce a minimum support price (MSP) for basic commodities like rice, wheat and sugar, in addition to the free food stamps and subsidised medicines.","token_len":437,"entropy":[2.828,1.2492,4.9538,5.9817,0.7744,1.3832,10.3338,2.9365,0.0006,1.964,1.2882,5.4714,1.9174,0.0138,4.6285,1.0338,1.6749,8.217,0.0017,0.4055,4.6167,6.3823,6.9546,16.2303,8.7932,5.7991,8.3781,2.7674,4.2997,3.2496,1.8509,5.308,4.848,0.3359,3.52,0.4401,1.5297,0.5769,4.8977,3.8998,1.5202,5.9423,2.0962,3.919,0.3729,0.6654,6.9921,5.8153,6.6913,2.9394,2.2623,0.094,0.3125,2.8427,3.9148,3.7113,6.889,5.8892,2.3847,2.1046,2.4838,4.0932,1.7018,5.4476,3.3393,2.0722,4.4492,1.0967,4.7823,1.8368,1.6163,3.1534,1.7891,4.1063,4.5538,5.1088,3.9638,0.5734,4.2311,0.0004,0.0101,0.0002,0.0002,0.001,4.5891,4.0061,3.9778,4.58,3.6625,4.5416,3.6555,4.2212,4.1164,4.152,1.5493,5.113,1.1521,0.0559,4.2488,2.8618,0.1038,6.0481,0.0765,2.6773,3.7109,1.1919,0.3112,0.0903,0.4154,2.5554,3.2927,0.0006,8.5484,0.1607,10.4293,4.4985,0.4351,3.4963,6.4602,3.9392,3.8897,5.8482,0.96,1.1944,4.9564,2.5432,6.7876,3.4979,1.9222,2.1546,2.3797,2.6018,5.1003,0.8196,4.8601,0.0095,2.1248,1.019,0.9255,1.4209,2.2764,2.247,2.2259,3.5507,6.5465,1.1322,1.9217,4.3869,1.3342,3.2402,3.1856,6.8967,1.4709,0.66,2.5542,2.1159,2.3958,0.4681,1.6871,4.526,4.4437,5.7787,0.1255,0.4408,0.0123,2.2253,0.9488,0.1173,2.1909,4.1257,0.0055,1.0805,2.4206,7.6522,0.0748,3.3683,0.0357,4.9833,4.8769,3.2205,0.883,1.0353,4.2327,4.0166,0.7451,3.6998,0.0074,2.4578,2.1324,4.1832,5.7945,1.9938,2.1435,6.1117,4.1136,7.994,3.5484,0.8888,0.6449,0.2136,1.4468,3.0284,7.9224,0.2743,0.8107,5.7178,0.1374,0.3211,3.0031,3.2702,3.5957,4.4219,0.0669,3.2867,5.2776,2.8691,4.4828,2.9153,0.9214,0.4448,0.0772,2.4676,4.4017,1.5115,5.701,0.418,2.5377,5.5639,1.6616,4.2605,0.78,0.1852,0.4737,3.4743,7.4297,0.3503,3.1075,1.9557,7.1985,6.7241,2.5445,2.5574,1.9715,6.5564,2.9973,2.1177,0.4782,0.0877,0.3887,3.464,5.4243,1.953,4.0995,2.9006,1.333,5.2851,2.6528,7.4414,1.3537,3.1434,3.2574,5.3291,2.4412,1.4979,4.1443,5.8527,0.091,0.3132,7.1695,3.0091,0.8485,4.5865,1.9547,5.3155,7.7178,4.4369,6.3541,5.838,4.497,4.1839,5.2073,4.5313,0.9072,3.6292,0.8758,1.5601,6.6593,0.0894,1.1827,1.369,1.6094,0.8157,1.1833,2.5001,2.811,0.2061,3.3058,1.2406,1.9421,6.7454,5.5172,1.6077,3.2759,5.6152,0.3717,1.1483,1.6413,1.8942,1.2577,1.0326,3.8016,0.1716,3.1679,6.8509,1.7988,6.8117,2.095,1.7989,0.8438,1.9101,4.741,4.4904,2.6486,5.216,0.0889,3.3405,3.1394,1.1283,0.7893,2.3112,5.0295,4.8347,3.5207,4.8993,1.6549,3.1079,1.8035,2.3031,5.5281,3.084,0.4864,5.7833,1.1522,6.4426,0.0027,4.7663,2.897,4.2155,4.9313,0.3717,0.7589,6.009,0.8792,3.1595,1.8573,3.2099,0.0771,7.9942,3.2089,3.8964,2.5497,5.8351,3.8991,0.0487,5.8257,1.0155,4.5492,0.6101,2.4773,6.8888,4.2284,3.8485,2.0568,1.53,0.1314,1.3655,7.8388,1.5273,0.1715,3.3923,1.1297,6.9161,1.0171,2.5478,0.3158,6.8286,2.7326,1.9676,5.3611,5.2617,6.6806,7.8797,0.9878,1.4099,1.5208,3.9047,4.8696,0.2748,1.194,4.0495,0.1592,2.8124,3.3562,3.2044,0.2394,2.1613,1.2647,4.4613,2.372,0.6026,2.9726,0.5555,0.0203,0.0287,1.3858,6.0291,2.752,2.2554,2.2415,0.9059,1.2393,0.9002,2.4671,2.2339,3.4349,3.5261,0.0048,1.9305,5.1577,2.5308,4.1381,2.8561,4.2143,0.2133,4.8328,0.5497]}
{"id":878,"ended":true,"length":400,"text":"Writing Merrifield's obituary for The Independent newspaper, the Museum of London archaeologist Peter Marsden described The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic as `` a masterly study of an unusual subject. `` The archaeologist described the book as having a \"likeable\" plot that was not \"too dramatic, but at the same time satisfyingly complex.''\n\nThere are two main components of the book that contribute \"to the wonderness of the mysterious world of ritual and magic'' \u2013 the main character, the philosopher and the \"sister\" of the creator of the ancient Egyptian god Meretz and the second part, and the protagonist, the author. That means they were related only as a result of a special kind of magic from Meretz himself that had little to do with ritual and more to do with understanding the nature of rituals and magic than with the occult - there was no magic involved in ritual. The most relevant element to discuss was the \"pioneering\" use of Meretz as a symbol and that is why in the end both of those elements were very heavily involved.\n\nThe book shows how Meretz brought the two worlds together through magic and what it had to do with belief, as well as what it meant to understand and love the human being as a God. It is one where both the creation, the ritual, and the \"pioneering\" ritual have been considered to be more important than the scientific or spiritual aspects. Meretz was one of the first and most notable pieces of scientific knowledge known to mankind.\n\nThe author also discusses how the use of Meretz as a symbol had little to do with theology or spirituality, but a complex web of magic and symbolism that had a profound effect on religious and the moral decisions of ancient Egyptians.\n\nThis book is full of such fascinating and compelling tales that anyone who feels so strongly about the way the ancient Egyptians used magic as a way to see the world about themselves. And it is packed with great information about the importance of learning about magic and its associated rituals and rituals. It is a great book, and one that anyone can do well.","token_len":437,"entropy":[10.7652,4.2974,2.1876,0.2641,2.8386,8.9141,0.6157,0.0149,2.5535,5.45,5.0797,3.8183,1.7044,2.9765,10.8311,0.6373,3.9498,8.5355,0.0895,5.2327,8.6061,0.2288,3.2996,4.9743,7.0201,1.0739,0.2145,9.8819,2.6845,6.0816,0.6467,10.0215,6.0577,5.5592,2.0044,3.8394,0.4374,4.7496,5.3835,3.9263,2.0944,5.1521,2.1138,5.058,0.1765,3.6844,1.308,5.5483,0.5326,4.0617,2.5568,5.0909,6.5324,0.7759,2.4404,6.9526,3.2974,2.4685,3.3624,3.9221,4.6307,6.3337,2.4207,2.2533,4.226,0.6684,0.1082,0.0055,7.1535,0.9043,3.9815,1.958,2.3151,0.0014,5.0184,1.3335,2.728,2.5907,5.84,1.2055,1.0458,0.3897,2.8831,6.212,9.3623,1.5228,0.9744,7.6191,8.6556,0.5763,1.0088,7.3829,4.0251,1.1555,1.8274,0.7365,0.077,4.0739,6.7623,1.0986,5.4664,3.2997,1.5363,2.6443,6.046,3.1583,0.9117,4.3837,4.3655,4.115,1.8182,1.3999,0.9987,6.8465,1.7846,0.6926,5.1549,4.2978,3.7327,3.9303,5.5512,4.6386,4.1093,1.1012,3.7405,2.2321,1.0541,5.6536,0.7965,5.1124,0.7119,0.5755,4.2274,1.0078,6.4241,5.6592,4.6867,2.8217,5.6661,5.2055,3.8266,2.1003,2.5075,0.0162,2.1537,5.2664,3.8826,0.0029,2.3917,6.3832,2.5056,0.0148,0.0013,3.6265,3.1907,2.9921,5.9811,0.9084,0.0183,0.0049,2.0605,1.6276,3.3323,0.1551,0.0061,0.0082,5.223,1.0047,2.7139,0.0968,4.8255,0.9959,0.7072,6.2412,1.4059,1.6268,6.004,5.9898,5.7461,1.5797,0.8275,2.8958,2.4728,1.7865,4.716,2.1563,2.018,5.0643,5.5319,2.7387,3.195,5.6633,2.1862,0.8091,3.0664,5.6429,3.9412,0.4309,1.2446,7.0428,0.0344,3.7831,0.0035,0.0006,2.5351,0.611,2.5614,2.8713,4.6761,2.454,2.4999,4.9644,1.2872,4.1963,5.2276,2.251,3.6947,1.771,1.4916,5.3637,5.5021,3.1144,1.7928,0.6791,0.0004,1.3317,2.1116,5.7925,1.5328,1.4198,0.0026,0.0006,6.0212,2.0289,4.4313,3.0623,0.2949,3.2279,3.2701,1.2743,4.4766,2.6956,5.6148,0.5207,1.2973,0.0077,6.8383,2.6483,4.0738,0.754,0.0097,3.4716,0.9786,1.7152,0.3834,4.7159,2.6319,4.2374,1.9111,5.1005,2.4127,3.3085,0.7523,6.4997,0.6999,2.1824,2.3127,4.6739,5.7692,3.2467,1.9151,6.584,5.6901,1.7614,4.0235,1.4307,0.387,0.2999,3.6366,3.5264,0.0141,0.0514,0.1729,5.8317,2.8968,1.942,5.5149,2.7671,0.4214,5.1733,1.4468,0.3355,0.9292,5.3387,3.8047,3.3789,1.4605,1.8387,3.5034,0.0016,0.0017,2.1125,3.7777,0.0962,0.2396,1.5399,3.8073,1.6678,5.6636,7.6287,0.1408,3.8563,2.1854,5.6241,0.3311,1.2809,1.396,1.8536,0.0002,1.3729,2.7415,2.6886,3.6277,2.059,1.6835,4.8681,0.0044,2.0487,0.002,0.0008,1.8183,0.2365,0.7361,3.4368,5.4963,0.1122,0.0035,0.0071,6.8368,1.4663,3.1412,1.4552,1.7914,5.2349,6.4133,4.9595,0.0924,4.7265,1.1353,4.1451,1.3028,2.303,3.1549,2.0692,1.1488,0.0994,4.83,2.2097,6.7286,5.0268,5.7506,0.9871,4.7067,1.4045,0.5741,1.3982,0.0002,3.9662,1.2192,1.2264,4.7517,0.0144,6.0475,1.7868,2.0015,4.6889,5.5607,2.1178,5.1702,0.9769,7.3897,5.3805,1.3783,0.1709,1.595,5.6418,2.6091,3.024,0.4983,3.3081,1.7321,4.3907,0.4045,2.0993,0.746,5.7619,1.2802,0.2308,7.2988,2.8032,5.3206,4.113,1.7432,0.8669,5.6744,0.2395,3.344,2.6384,1.2065,1.1198,5.3742,0.1121,4.8684,1.5671,1.3114,0.916,3.1064,5.1263,3.1342,0.9858,3.3281,1.2497,2.412,0.7528,1.5592,2.8796,1.2966,2.0728,1.2711,1.8893,0.5854,2.7892,1.7167,5.7772,2.5973,1.8858]}

She forces Jack aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, a powerful supertanker known as the \"Queen of Spies\" that can take control of all the world's major power grids while being a vital force for their country-wide struggle against imperialism and their former \"war buddy\" \u2013 Queen Mary. Although Jack and Angelica never get along and often fight for each other, they are eventually able to work together to bring this war into a more peaceful and cooperative, democratic, and global war.\n\nOn one occasion, Jack and Angelica face off against a giant cyborg cyborg named Dr. Nod who is the leader of a giant group of cyborg cyborgs to stop him. The cyborg cyborg goes on to kill a woman whom the cyborg cyborgs are using as a weapon against them, but is instead captured by the cyborg cyborgs and is sent to war with the cyborg cyborg cyborgs. The cyborg cyborgs are then sent to the prison where Jack and Angelica escape and embark on a secret mission to retrieve the cyborg cyborg cyborgs and restore them to their former glory.\n\nThe film was filmed during WWI. Jack and Angelica have no memory of this war. In 1942, Jack and Angelica travel back in time to find that their past is being ripped apart while walking through time and seeing who they are.

{"id":411,"ended":true,"length":408,"text":"The Friends representatives continued attempting to make the bill more favorable to the historic peace churches. The Burke @ - @ Wadsworth Bill passed on September 14, 1940, becoming the Selective Training Facility bill which became the Senate Bill. On August 11, a separate bill was introduced by the Democrats to eliminate the Bill, while eliminating a two year ban on the removal of Confederate symbols from the U.S. Civil War monument in Virginia. Although this bill passed the House, it failed to make the Senate because the legislation was put forward by Republicans, the Republicans would make their majority vote in absenting the Democrats because the Republican party was unable to block it due to the Democrats\u2019 refusal to vote against any of the bill\u2019s provisions.\n\nEven as these efforts failed. In light of the fact that all those who have worked for the abolitionist movement on behalf of the abolitionist movement have been assassinated by a Confederate soldier, the Democrats have decided to block any further amendments or debate on the bill and that is unacceptable in the end both for the abolitionists and all those who believe that the Bill would lead to more slavery. The Democratic party has become so convinced that it does not support their agenda that they refuse to vote in the Senate and instead support the Senate bill\n\nSo what is the answer? It is this simple,\n\nOur ancestors fought in battles of liberty. Our ancestors would not have been free if it didn\u2019t lie at the top of their paychecks. We fought in battles to protect our civil liberties. We fought to protect our Constitution. We fought to protect our families. We fought for the right to vote and free speech. We fought to support slavery. We defended the right to vote. We fought for equal pay. We fought to protect our democracy.\n\nWe fought to defeat the American Dream.

Seven camps closed in November 1976, and three have not recovered. She was ordered to destroy all facilities that were used by the pipeline company including the water storage depot, water tank, and chemical plant.\n\nSamantha Leckart, the U.S. Ambassador & Acting Chair of the Trans @ @ \u2013 Alaska Pipeline Board, notes that:\n\n\u201cDuring the last decade, the United States has fought through numerous and destructive pipeline projects to successfully provide protection from climate change and to reduce its reliance on fossil fuel. While Alaska has been instrumental in establishing the pipeline industry as the leading producer of hydrocarbon fuels and the world\u2019s top importer to coal, the United States is in need of a long-term industry leader. The pipeline industry should seek innovative technologies to enhance the quality of our natural resources and support an economic growth economy.\u201d\n\nSamantha Leckart continues, \u201cWe believe that the federal government should take seriously that the Alaska pipeline industry needs a long-term, strong and long-term, global investment to succeed in protecting and improving the environment, human health, and the welfare of the people of Alaska. The goal, we believe, will be to create more jobs and growth in the country, and to encourage new economic opportunities for the people of Alaska.\u201d\n\nSamantha Leckart believes that \u201cthe pipeline industry is the backbone for many of America\u2019s economic opportunities. The pipeline industry is also the largest natural-gas exporter and the second largest exporter to Russia. The United States has one of the world\u2019s strongest natural gas security agreements with Russia. All of our pipeline partners currently have national pipelines of some capacity. We are the only gas exporter to have an interstate natural gas pipeline.\u201d\n\nSamantha Leckart also notes \u201cthe pipeline industry is also the largest natural-gas exporter to Russia.

{"id":22,"ended":true,"length":415,"text":"Cullen made his NHL debut in 1988 \u2013 89, appearing in 79 games with the Penguins and scoring 49 points. He was given a greater role with the Penguins the following year after spending the final six years with the Carolina Hurricanes.\n\nCullen played in all 36 NHL games with the Penguins, scoring 14 goals and 37 points. His time out with the Penguins was an anomaly in his current schedule \u2013 being on the ice with the Pittsburgh Penguins was something different. The Penguins got to see him for much longer in the Stanley Cup Playoffs than they expected.\n\nThe NHL has changed a lot and I truly believe that there is one thing that stands out as a player who has improved so much. One man who has done the opposite of what the NHL has and was a great player as a player as a manager.\n\nAs you can see there was no time to change who we were before the playoffs. However much the changes have made in our games I believe there has been more focus and focus on the big picture rather than a short time in the spotlight.\n\nThe Penguins also signed an incredible young defenseman, who will go on to work for a major league club. The best player that I know that has played his way into a professional roster, as a veteran.\n\nThe Penguins are certainly in the top flight for rookies in terms of quality of play. They are also in the top six in the overall NHL in overall points. With a good goalie that is on a playoff team right now they will hopefully get rewarded sooner rather than later.\n\nSo I agree with everyone else that the Penguins needed to rebuild and strengthen both their roster and prospects. Unfortunately the Penguins have found themselves in situations where they would not be able to rebuild the Penguins and would need to rebuild.\n\nI also think that the goaltending situation in this NHL is so bad it has become the most glaring thing about NHL. I think there are some things that were not expected, but there were times I found myself asking what can be done.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping that things are better and the Penguins will be in the top four once again in the playoffs.","token_len":437,"entropy":[8.7405,1.1419,7.3852,2.1135,6.1485,0.0456,1.3056,4.3338,6.8891,10.6029,5.6512,8.7658,0.0773,5.2183,0.1355,2.0085,0.6463,3.7651,2.2063,2.8302,6.4697,1.6204,1.1731,1.1368,1.4832,6.3777,1.0119,10.1336,1.2004,2.5152,0.2897,1.9793,5.4621,0.1359,0.8628,2.885,4.1756,1.8109,2.3073,2.6793,1.2749,1.7892,0.3705,4.5566,0.0125,0.801,0.823,0.0005,3.7164,0.0131,0.0003,2.5692,1.6944,2.7043,5.646,2.2091,0.4371,1.7158,0.4251,1.0668,1.872,1.446,3.5934,0.3511,0.4652,4.4563,0.2387,0.9554,3.3393,5.4259,7.6406,1.8208,0.3252,1.2167,1.0416,4.4828,4.1897,3.3255,1.6329,8.475,7.4146,3.8141,6.1789,3.1408,0.5059,1.9458,2.2195,0.8949,3.5735,0.2082,2.6458,6.1163,4.9711,0.7872,3.0854,1.0838,5.6406,2.4933,1.4677,1.4362,3.1377,5.6567,2.0701,2.5565,1.439,5.6001,0.0014,0.4078,2.0945,1.0559,3.4388,1.0065,0.7106,0.0002,2.6988,4.5161,2.9588,3.4234,1.9194,0.1124,5.1733,3.9038,5.7184,0.5295,1.0503,3.8606,0.8961,4.1782,1.9687,0.6569,4.0698,0.3673,3.5596,1.7714,3.9814,2.0131,1.49,4.8815,2.7758,0.5916,2.8115,5.0935,5.0431,1.5563,0.6658,3.3567,3.7551,4.049,1.4218,0.5299,1.9288,2.5007,1.1703,6.9756,5.1454,3.0359,2.7244,1.5434,4.8868,0.6733,1.0279,5.0728,1.6593,5.3302,1.3277,0.8879,0.0002,4.507,3.286,0.6276,0.2255,4.9384,2.8747,2.1915,4.7112,1.4264,5.359,5.0969,3.0218,1.1827,5.1249,1.7317,4.1045,1.1476,5.5332,7.1586,2.6049,4.2791,1.5192,1.8063,2.7912,2.6117,4.9504,4.4017,1.8517,2.7195,3.0804,0.328,3.0911,4.3299,1.8664,2.681,1.1162,1.4947,5.2598,0.1473,4.7485,0.0142,3.8507,3.3383,3.25,2.9563,0.6424,4.7184,0.4389,0.724,0.0001,2.5159,1.6866,4.8946,4.9378,4.4452,4.5762,1.4365,1.9041,1.8138,4.2691,2.8375,4.4245,2.5484,0.0201,6.6507,2.0414,3.1964,4.8372,1.5901,1.1481,0.872,2.6263,5.0943,2.8462,3.0689,1.6813,1.9994,2.9629,1.7771,1.8355,3.8914,2.4944,0.8289,2.3954,4.1194,5.5658,3.4373,4.3514,2.505,5.1273,3.6787,0.7828,0.0001,2.2461,1.1501,1.9785,4.9178,2.8871,0.9031,3.4691,6.489,4.2312,5.9914,1.8933,3.1167,0.0018,4.5181,2.5086,1.8156,1.2161,2.2975,1.6117,2.2473,1.7285,0.4441,0.7526,2.5357,1.3471,1.9818,6.2292,2.4038,1.6343,4.9865,1.4474,1.9141,4.5525,2.224,4.5866,4.9653,3.6527,1.5193,3.7259,2.2227,5.277,1.5182,5.1638,0.0081,2.6314,2.3403,5.9447,2.4719,6.5679,5.982,0.0754,0.017,0.0003,0.397,0.3813,0.0001,3.932,2.9939,7.354,0.595,3.4127,4.3459,0.7257,1.474,0.7936,6.7825,0.6477,5.4616,2.0865,6.4016,7.5819,0.9298,2.5269,0.1971,5.6497,0.7508,5.0897,2.2859,1.8822,1.7986,4.725,1.8213,0.7291,4.6894,0.1956,0.6191,4.607,2.2471,1.0232,0.397,0.0036,3.8049,3.3784,4.3323,3.508,4.358,3.1165,0.2204,2.8977,3.8897,0.7987,0.0001,2.1719,3.8195,1.5931,0.6298,1.2253,5.8693,0.0631,2.3217,2.3693,3.7213,3.6523,1.0255,4.3532,1.2157,3.1198,2.4092,2.121,3.0134,3.2423,4.5521,4.7939,2.6719,4.8461,2.8027,2.4185,1.6569,3.1388,1.5321,2.9788,2.3141,0.3333,4.7918,2.8864,4.9185,3.7371,0.885,2.9248,1.877,3.5505,4.1342,4.4832,0.0779,4.6211,4.578,6.1657,0.9886,0.125,1.5982,0.8661,0.0001,4.904,19.1097,7.4201,4.5016,7.2779,0.6539,4.8531,2.0271,3.5652,2.6463,2.3174,0.7876,2.6614,1.3013,3.1507,0.929,2.3648,3.2898,5.0253,0.1763,2.2439,1.0567,1.0186,0.3774]}

Although he was a member of the Spanish Congress, the Spanish expedition lasted about 4 months while he was away.\n\nHe was one of the first Spaniards of the New World \u2013 to establish his official residence in the Aztec kingdom. Cort\u00e9s was the first foreigner to visit America and the White House, the very base set up for the presidency and Senate, where he and President George Washington were later to be installed. On October 3, 1325 he was assassinated by an unidentified man on American soil after a campaign to persuade him not to allow a White House coup. Cort\u00e9s was buried near his home town of El Dorado on the site of El Dorado.\n\nOn October 26, 1327, Cort\u00e9s was awarded the Gold Star for the first time and had his first Senate in Washington. In that same year, he organized the election of a congressional delegation led by Vice President Juan Carlos S\u00e1nchez D\u00e1lmo. A series of elections, some in Mexico, some in Peru and others in the United States, led to support for the first constitutional referendum.\n\nOn December 9, 1327, he was awarded his fifth Silver Star.

'Cause you were at the back of a strip club.''\n\nJennings joined Nashville in 1968.\n\nHe also worked as a clerk at an Olivet (Colby) joint in North Carolina.\n\n\"I'd get to go in there and I would put myself in that restaurant, where there was a sign for, or had to have a certain number of customers to come in to get you in line, you were supposed to go to the front,\" Jennings recalled.\n\nAsked what he thinks will be the same restaurant as his predecessor, Jennings said `` Oh my gosh.. you know, this was a restaurant that was very popular with people.... It wasn't a restaurant like it is today.''\n\nBut Jennings said the diner in his previous restaurant, Cajun Deli, was always the favorite, because a customer would go to the counter right after the meal.\n\n\"At the time I was the manager in that little diner, you know, you didn'... you had to take a look when you were on your way out to take a look at your staff - you would see like eight, 12 guys - you'd say 'Well come on, this is too many people.'

{"id":2539,"ended":false,"length":387,"text":"In October 1857, an expedition led by Edward Fitzgerald Beale was tasked with establishing a trade route along the 35th parallel from Fort Smith, Arkansas, to Los Angeles, California. From there the Beale expedition, led by James Henry Beale, discovered three major \"new-buildings\" on the Pacific coast of the Pacific Northwest, such as Mount Hood, the largest rock peak in the U.S. At the same time, the Beale expedition started a massive expedition on the American Samoa mainland. Both Beale and Henry Beale are still credited with saving the lives and property of their crew and rescuing the expedition.\nOn March 20, 1862, Beale's expedition passed through Arizona and Montana before reaching Mexico. The team that accompanied Beale and Henry and his group reached Mexico as early as October 1867. In its first visit in April 1868, Beale was spotted in Mexico City by a group of soldiers. On 19 May he was taken to Mexico City for the first half-hour of his stay. He spent a month there and, due to his illness, remained in Mexico until he was given a chance to go back to South America, where he returned to his base, where he set up camp. In January 1867, four weeks after Beale's return, his base was raided by the Mexico City police. On April 12, Beale and Henry Beale were arrested and sentenced to death at Port San Antonio.\nIn 1878 Beale was awarded a Bronze Star for his efforts of valor and bravery. He was also awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the outbreak of the Spanish-American War. When the war between the United States and Mexico started in 1879\u201380, the Beale Expedition of 1878 and the Beale Incident led to more than 100 deaths on American soil. The Beale Incident led to the first major American occupation of Mexico until it was declared over on April 14, 1888. After the outbreak of the Mexican\u2013American War of 1896\u201397, the Beale Expedition of 1887 and the Beale Incident occurred until the end of World War I.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links","token_len":438,"entropy":[8.1794,6.4586,4.3857,0.2503,4.1894,3.9312,2.3734,0.0062,5.2585,8.7902,6.9259,2.6534,2.9801,5.1294,0.4023,4.4697,0.8416,7.2565,0.4407,3.7524,0.2144,10.935,0.7916,0.8162,2.7996,4.9992,4.802,1.3826,2.5106,1.3269,0.3072,5.7778,0.147,0.7175,0.0625,0.4402,5.3155,1.5991,2.4518,5.6371,0.234,2.1644,3.9898,1.0995,0.0107,3.4736,4.7419,3.6151,0.2225,0.2618,6.4362,5.5863,3.504,6.6689,4.992,3.6867,4.1887,7.0819,0.333,2.154,0.3614,4.1018,0.8818,1.175,1.9577,3.5675,1.6532,1.5424,4.9055,0.005,5.7146,4.3242,0.6649,2.1158,5.5462,4.5563,5.0977,0.3295,0.3492,3.6003,0.0009,0.0034,1.1337,4.3514,0.974,1.6135,0.0115,0.5327,1.2079,0.4676,0.1292,0.354,5.9767,2.1189,3.8345,3.5594,3.5864,0.4372,5.3195,5.7965,5.2156,1.6505,6.2278,1.3035,0.0899,0.3572,4.1671,0.8918,0.0223,4.5085,3.7677,4.0305,0.5903,4.7301,0.5819,0.5963,3.9108,2.0249,0.0439,2.2602,4.0257,3.5509,5.8796,1.955,6.772,1.8824,0.9643,9.5489,3.0667,3.2695,0.0783,3.075,0.1582,2.5007,0.0143,2.4205,2.2351,5.2939,0.5606,6.3646,1.239,5.5926,4.1325,2.0897,5.3555,0.7841,1.8182,6.4017,4.0354,4.0743,1.5105,0.0016,2.5617,0.3333,5.8367,5.3024,3.6913,3.2315,2.73,5.3145,1.7254,0.0096,2.9966,1.3179,3.5069,0.5143,2.5687,6.1529,1.4545,5.9782,3.8322,3.964,0.547,0.8894,0.1427,1.5655,0.0137,2.8784,4.3913,2.3681,2.8087,1.8282,1.7359,1.6722,1.9853,0.0828,4.6771,1.8658,2.9925,8.1816,1.7617,4.0577,1.0234,3.398,1.0032,2.4281,0.3048,2.7459,2.4348,1.4842,7.2338,2.9749,3.0586,0.5794,1.3987,1.9708,0.9847,2.646,3.9268,3.4532,3.3492,1.2898,2.0188,4.6789,5.8643,0.0163,1.6957,3.5685,0.1333,4.778,1.5437,0.7293,1.4173,3.0042,1.241,4.949,1.3052,3.0544,0.3524,3.7724,1.1583,0.4395,5.7798,0.2155,3.3878,0.6227,0.1996,3.1771,0.7777,2.0914,5.2148,2.8979,3.5839,0.1723,5.1699,1.4332,1.3898,1.2111,2.4077,3.6233,0.2883,3.4442,0.3675,6.7533,3.4505,0.2093,2.4197,0.0209,0.8297,1.2555,1.109,3.1541,5.1069,0.573,2.7987,0.3133,1.458,6.6161,1.4541,1.1168,0.6898,1.9488,2.8875,3.3644,0.1969,3.908,0.0145,2.0202,0.7396,2.7654,0.0084,0.9343,1.282,1.3746,3.8921,0.0497,1.2581,4.0514,7.678,6.0473,1.5723,1.0596,1.3844,2.4175,2.1562,3.4323,3.3757,0.011,1.3014,3.3844,1.9264,2.8983,0.0533,1.6533,1.0338,2.0298,6.5932,6.984,0.0772,1.7932,1.7232,0.9294,2.0113,0.707,1.4555,0.6862,0.7801,2.7591,0.0183,0.0838,0.7056,0.6394,2.9325,1.9694,0.2832,6.7681,0.0039,0.5015,1.6882,1.832,0.024,0.0139,0.6752,5.1398,1.3686,1.5061,6.985,0.4924,0.836,0.0018,0.0536,0.2603,3.8721,1.273,1.5124,2.4476,7.7507,0.3261,0.1711,1.6051,1.8372,0.0874,1.1798,4.7049,0.4528,3.1714,3.0135,1.2928,2.33,0.013,8.0839,4.403,0.1678,4.2871,0.8202,2.9321,1.2129,3.6894,2.9429,0.6573,0.3999,2.2079,1.5408,0.0239,1.3347,3.1324,0.1024,0.8086,4.3553,2.4151,2.3788,3.3481,0.2367,1.5648,5.4721,3.8139,0.9618,4.2117,3.2293,3.074,2.4969,3.5043,0.0217,4.8514,0.3666,4.4713,0.8929,3.7918,0.1066,0.5243,0.9994,6.4869,0.0407,0.0432,3.3797,6.7471,0.8236,0.6476,0.2325,0.8823,0.9427,0.0143,0.4656,1.8432,0.1624,5.8078,2.4958,0.5132,0.4595,0.0044,0.1197,6.8161,5.0034,1.3701,1.3073,0.0405,1.9387,0.0022,0.374,0.3683,0.8498,6.0788,4.4849,1.1138,0.0006,6.4583,1.0525]}

Watchmen has received three major awards, including the David Lynch award, and its second season has earned an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Film.\n\nIn the trailer, Warner Bros. can be heard telling the audience what the upcoming show might look like. And Snyder says it\u2019s \u201cexciting\u201d [emphasis our sources].\n\n\u201cIf and when Warner Bros. makes it one of its own, we will certainly be there.\u201d said David Lee Roth, president of Warner Bros. Television in a statement.\n\nThe press release also points to the fact that Warner Bros. is working on a second season \u2014 and that the release is scheduled for October 26.\n\nOf course, Snyder has never written or directed the pilot, and that would make it hard to know where that series would take place.\n\n\u201cThere would be an incredible amount of fan service in that series because there are so many writers and directors who want to do it,\u201d Snyder said in a statement. \u201cWe know what we\u2019ve got. And the show will do great in many ways.\u201d\n\nWarner Bros. originally tried to release a series in the fall of 2014, but dropped its plans after a series creator died and they were unable to make a season this year.\n\nSo instead they released the show with a third season in 2018 and are trying to expand their offering into a fourth season by next year. [Via Collider.com].\n\nAt the time of the report, fans were skeptical that this would be a season for Watchmen, and it feels so many years to go until the show hit television. If HBO is successful with the first season, and the show comes out with a fourth season of Watchmen, Snyder is sure to be a huge hit.\n\nHe said, \u201cI think any show is likely to be about storytelling.\u201d","token_len":439,"entropy":[1.9909,12.6923,1.9288,0.477,0.196,7.8449,1.7693,8.0374,0.2285,7.6647,1.4036,0.5848,2.662,1.9441,11.7912,0.0928,5.419,0.8132,0.8484,12.0846,5.5348,11.9533,3.7125,2.4242,5.7165,8.1034,2.9158,0.8956,1.4306,2.4048,1.8877,0.0072,1.621,6.3695,1.8894,2.4857,0.7381,3.9314,2.4914,1.1987,5.4938,1.1476,3.4816,3.446,0.2347,5.9014,2.6275,0.5159,4.5896,0.0965,2.3039,3.5467,5.2604,4.4397,0.6015,1.1974,0.4146,1.7832,6.4338,3.9487,4.2267,2.0376,1.2127,3.6269,2.9889,1.1489,2.3802,2.7934,2.3489,2.694,0.227,0.6771,0.2286,2.3793,4.2451,0.5161,2.738,0.0007,3.3927,2.2645,4.5412,1.1414,6.2261,0.0196,0.1905,7.213,0.1045,2.7191,3.1407,1.85,0.8851,4.5811,2.4059,3.9377,3.3189,4.1974,0.4869,0.0016,0.9701,5.4725,3.5222,2.4232,2.703,17.2618,7.2984,3.6384,5.8911,5.2302,5.7167,0.1147,1.0383,6.0978,7.1632,3.0624,6.834,9.5422,1.7094,0.729,0.0002,4.9448,2.5757,5.3118,6.046,0.016,6.0862,0.0513,0.0643,3.1018,3.7834,7.1665,0.6331,0.9549,2.7642,0.7712,2.2696,1.5339,4.468,1.1557,3.1324,2.0894,3.5929,6.4726,9.2718,5.4233,6.5722,0.9069,1.368,2.2982,0.4718,2.5191,0.0365,0.2527,1.7636,4.2429,0.8068,0.4501,0.3682,1.015,0.0002,2.9801,5.9983,0.6314,2.1913,4.8555,1.3778,1.7676,2.1157,0.0626,3.2423,0.0273,0.1174,1.3795,2.3698,0.7599,0.79,3.3753,0.6355,5.0866,1.9471,1.795,1.9504,7.0074,2.7078,3.4115,0.492,3.3632,5.0896,1.0834,0.9253,0.0002,5.5556,0.1034,0.1154,3.5318,2.279,4.4566,4.88,3.0409,0.37,3.3576,4.8132,1.65,1.2618,3.8263,3.1492,2.2425,0.9417,3.0539,0.3594,2.3762,3.6628,4.1769,3.6503,1.4091,2.7654,0.3898,0.4202,1.7431,0.0002,3.6608,0.9416,3.871,4.2365,0.5183,3.8499,4.7548,0.6193,0.0173,4.0943,3.3168,3.5565,2.5608,3.5571,5.082,2.8527,1.5718,0.778,0.0295,5.9938,1.1452,0.8977,1.7888,3.9578,0.1448,2.2198,1.7811,1.7111,3.9939,3.7541,4.8092,0.5861,2.422,1.1818,0.5751,0.2088,4.2408,0.3487,2.5855,4.3589,2.9413,1.7427,15.5231,5.88,1.9617,1.7583,2.0502,3.1242,3.6912,2.8501,2.0294,4.1434,2.0603,3.9973,4.5747,1.0872,0.8108,1.5039,1.6491,0.3886,0.0002,5.7493,0.0,0.0083,0.1468,7.1178,5.5126,0.2553,5.1399,1.9052,3.7444,1.8254,2.1099,2.8655,0.3519,2.3558,0.5888,0.3244,5.7731,3.5176,1.5414,1.2835,2.2675,2.5173,3.6658,6.4881,2.7917,4.8414,2.0759,1.2112,0.0044,3.1564,0.9297,5.8984,7.083,1.0953,0.2474,0.9937,0.0002,4.1022,6.1049,3.0999,3.0903,1.8881,3.7835,4.3149,1.1791,3.4672,0.1758,1.4179,4.1454,2.1712,4.4328,4.2511,0.1354,4.8228,2.4379,6.7449,3.3234,1.7215,3.1098,0.3959,4.299,2.6512,0.7638,0.2243,5.8256,4.8373,0.5126,1.5487,0.0028,3.5597,0.5094,0.0002,5.7398,0.9233,1.0701,0.9123,2.2327,4.7737,0.2509,4.9373,1.1531,3.879,1.536,3.9796,1.6955,1.1794,0.7918,5.1025,2.6546,1.1465,0.0051,1.2354,1.7518,2.8167,6.2553,7.0196,5.2761,4.7027,4.8428,1.5534,3.4849,1.869,1.8804,6.2966,4.6034,0.8099,5.1232,4.3787,2.2372,3.7112,1.8843,1.6029,3.2854,0.2453,0.4226,3.2643,2.1134,2.3482,4.6379,1.3813,3.206,0.7969,2.5021,0.1847,4.9809,2.3561,0.0115,0.6272,4.4159,2.653,3.1648,1.2594,2.0341,2.4521,2.0869,2.5106,0.5714,0.5285,0.0002,4.8057,2.3594,1.9863,4.3211,0.5363,1.7467,1.1661,6.7514,1.1174,3.2805,7.5714,0.1884,1.6043,5.9612,5.3466,1.4833,0.9765,1.9133]}

In the days following, St. Lucia was placed under mandatory evacuation orders.\nThe official news agency, LCY, reported that some 5,000 people were evacuated from the island as a result of the emergency.\nIn November 2010, local media reported that there were 6,500 people unaccounted for as a result of Hurricane Matthew.\nOn January 3, 2012, a government decree required that residents evacuate all their homes while evacuating schools due to the impending Storm Matthew.\nSome 1,800 people, including parents and children, have lost both homes, which were built around the storm victims. The local government closed the schools that day, with the exception of small businesses, restaurants and other establishments that have not been affected.\nOn July 13, 2013, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a hurricane risk index.

In the 1980s, he became friends with Patrick Morrow, who was attempting to climb the tallest peak on the planet. The climbers discovered that he was much stronger than they were, and were shocked by the knowledge of his strength.\nIt was in 1987 that, following a brief meeting through the television show, Patrick Morrow was invited to join the expedition. For the rest of his career, he climbed the tallest, most famous, and deepest peaks on Earth.\nMorrow is one of the most valuable and popular climbers in the world. Today, Morrow is considered one of the greatest mountain climbers of all time by mountain climbers. He is one of the most important climbers because his style of climbing is very precise. This is reflected in his personal style in his work and his ability to find and deal with difficult passes. In addition to the numerous accolades he received from his admirers, the rock climber is also very popular in Europe. In his recent life, Morrow has spent more than a century on the slopes of Mount Everest, where he has become known for his incredible power and his incredible mastery of all aspects of climbing.\nDuring his long career, Morrow has also been extremely active in the professional movement of the climbing community, particularly in the field of rock climbing. During his time on Everest, Morrow climbed six peaks, where he has experienced almost all of the best conditions that climb on this rock. While climbing on Everest, Morrow has witnessed almost all the natural wonders that are the result of climbing on Mount Everest: nature, wildlife, rain and clouds.\nHe is a very popular rock climber in Russia as well. In the beginning of the 1990s, Morrow joined the Team Everest team. They were able to climb over the first few kilometers of mountain ice with some exceptional results, and then they climbed to heights as high as 10,000 meters.

{"id":3714,"ended":true,"length":323,"text":"Fatty acids are made by fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce acetyl @ - @ CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that produce the acyl chain, which is then replaced by acetyl (co-A3, @A4). Acyl chains in acetyl (co-A7) (O2) can then be replaced by any number of non-acyl groups, thereby resulting in acetyl chain reduction. For example, acetyl chain reduction, wherein the acetyl chain is replaced by a non-acyl group, and acetyl chain reduction, wherein one or more acetyl groups are replaced by only one acetyl chain (i.e., acetyl chain reduction), are preferred because the acetyl sequence is replaced to form acetyl chain reduction. However, in some cases acetyl (acrylic) chains are replaced by a non-acyl chain, that is, an acetyl chain or non-acyl chain is replaced by an acetyl chain that is replaced by all cyclophosphates. For example, an acetyl (acrylic) chain is replaced by an oracyl (acrylonitrile) chain in the acetyl chain (co-A7) chain (O2) where acetyl is the predominant aliphatic terminal as well as the acarylene chain, an acrylonitrile chain or acrylonitrile chain is replaced by an unsaturated monomer or an ester monoamine. Finally, an acetyl (acrylic) chain is replaced by an arabidino (butyldiphenyl ether), a poly (ethylene glycol) chain is replaced by a sulfonamido (butyldiphenyl ether), an acetyl group (arylene ether), a non-(p-methoxy)-acetyl chain is replaced by an alcohol (acetylene glycol), an acetyl group (acryloyloyloyloyloxy) chain is replaced by an alkoxy group and a mono amino group is replaced by an unsaturated monomer.","token_len":439,"entropy":[7.9588,8.2199,2.3243,5.0925,2.229,5.1492,2.6484,3.2779,1.445,2.8,7.6549,0.0828,2.2601,3.7597,6.4933,6.2741,0.208,16.6786,4.7596,8.3959,8.187,1.8897,8.9745,1.1792,2.0741,5.821,0.1873,5.353,3.3911,1.7517,2.0283,0.6479,1.2437,8.823,1.3127,2.6778,6.5514,0.5303,6.2928,1.9516,3.8726,2.3796,2.748,0.0223,1.625,3.1882,1.4438,1.2216,1.9249,5.1373,0.2027,2.0541,0.1098,5.1851,4.5055,1.8648,3.9117,8.5746,4.0335,5.8679,4.8017,1.7319,2.499,3.8239,8.1448,2.5379,3.483,2.393,0.0706,3.991,0.8686,0.0464,0.1177,4.5755,1.2048,4.5035,5.9093,3.3433,0.9889,4.0008,3.2321,0.7872,3.1928,0.139,6.1136,3.2457,0.0114,5.0949,0.4273,6.7762,0.0865,6.0772,1.7741,4.8018,4.259,0.0016,2.9979,0.0447,2.339,5.3436,0.9028,4.2782,0.633,0.0646,2.5308,0.0543,1.6278,1.3402,4.8547,5.9917,1.493,1.7273,0.0167,1.145,0.6381,2.3111,0.1757,1.3416,1.4861,0.1174,0.5516,0.0079,0.2151,0.7702,5.6026,3.2063,0.0165,0.8196,1.3233,0.9664,0.1993,5.4607,0.5508,0.0582,2.3378,0.0044,1.3304,0.5813,2.1844,0.641,6.5221,0.5984,1.8867,0.0018,2.7703,2.5936,3.9792,0.0012,0.0006,0.0793,2.381,0.0491,1.4002,1.8295,1.8584,3.8204,6.9015,3.5689,1.9435,2.0079,0.0013,7.8779,1.3115,6.2594,5.7006,2.5429,2.4266,0.0339,0.5154,2.7352,0.8268,3.9551,0.0018,2.9824,2.4551,1.0253,3.769,0.0014,5.1531,4.6531,2.9963,1.7202,1.0756,1.3232,2.5569,0.389,1.9374,0.7537,0.0256,1.9976,0.0087,3.4056,1.3397,6.4566,0.2866,0.154,3.3302,0.893,0.0424,0.559,5.3735,3.0446,0.0305,1.0323,0.0109,0.8331,2.7916,2.2516,0.2708,1.721,0.616,0.0206,0.5559,3.2706,0.3537,3.5317,0.1925,6.6016,7.5546,6.8848,0.7181,1.5541,1.3903,2.9231,0.1251,0.0059,3.6795,0.5957,0.0082,4.2134,0.7439,0.813,0.145,0.3385,1.5491,0.4732,0.1695,1.4762,7.3999,6.2485,0.0136,2.5032,0.6883,1.3852,3.2668,0.0183,0.0008,0.486,0.4405,3.8796,2.2344,1.9656,0.0883,0.4366,2.5332,3.9923,0.1798,0.3559,1.8967,1.2997,4.4161,1.6798,0.4547,0.1144,1.1139,5.9319,2.9471,0.0103,1.6277,3.362,6.9044,7.7508,1.4411,0.0026,8.999,5.8807,2.0359,0.0124,0.9596,3.68,10.0715,3.977,2.249,2.4484,4.8486,1.9765,0.1286,0.9782,0.0085,0.0032,0.6992,3.8355,1.5682,0.0253,0.4987,0.0291,0.0371,1.2626,0.7409,0.3865,0.1458,1.1385,8.027,0.0368,6.5367,0.4264,3.2758,2.7885,3.5392,0.0986,5.7455,2.0867,3.1255,4.7102,0.0094,1.6042,0.5951,0.0079,1.2496,0.2522,1.0334,0.0305,0.1714,0.388,0.2997,0.1368,0.704,5.6377,5.9396,3.8892,6.3224,3.0802,5.4196,3.4021,5.1892,2.5849,1.5646,0.0481,5.8739,2.3672,1.8758,1.9305,4.9154,5.5006,1.8581,0.8938,0.0133,0.3711,0.6866,5.7681,0.1986,0.0669,1.2483,6.5202,2.1765,1.1939,3.4364,0.6781,2.8192,0.6548,0.2389,0.0905,0.1557,0.0585,1.0259,0.6319,2.1121,2.7769,0.4635,4.1572,1.8125,9.225,1.113,7.1636,1.1339,1.5686,3.3059,6.6497,4.7558,2.1317,4.8277,0.2559,0.3288,1.9023,4.0622,0.1441,1.3628,1.6832,0.1985,0.0552,0.7856,5.3705,1.6258,2.976,3.8524,0.7884,0.0031,0.9842,1.665,0.8623,0.2756,0.4622,0.3726,3.0707,0.1063,2.2623,5.7372,0.1792,6.6756,0.056,5.6471,0.0546,4.0066,0.1069,4.7589,1.501,0.5287,0.9361,0.0746,0.0407,0.5366,5.0253,3.6935,0.8873,3.5274,1.3805,4.2386,7.2545,2.8972,1.1884,0.3016,0.1099,0.6918,5.1969,0.0149,1.6271,0.0389,1.1615]}

His shared first place with Alexander < unk > in the final round of the European Series of the 2008 season shows that he has an experience, and a passion for motorsport history while he has time off work in Berlin to compete. #\n\nIn 2006, Carlsen qualified for the 2010 World Masters Championship, but lost out to Stefan Molyneux because of his poor second place finish in the final round of the Euro Series. He was also considered a disappointment and missed out on the qualification for the 2010 World Masters Championship in Germany. Carlsen will now focus on winning the 2010 World Masters Championship in Germany.\n\nIn 2013, Carlsen made a step to the Championship as a young professional driver. The German driver was considered a top contender for the 2013 Euro Series Challenge during the season due to his first place finish in the final round in the Euro Series. He won in round 17, 14, 11, 7, 5, 5, 3, 0 and his third place finish followed by a victory in round 15 where Carlsen had first place of the second place and third place in the round 17 round of the European Series Challenge. Carlsen reached the semifinals where he lost out on the qualifying for the 2010 World Masters Championship. During his fifth place finish in the Round 17 round of the European Series Challenge at the Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf, he qualified for the 2010 World Masters Championship. He won five races in nine championship appearances in the Cup series which included championship victories at the Panzoll-Neuwahlfahrt, the Krak\u00f3w World Cup and the 2014 World Masters Circuit. In the first round, Carlsen finished on the front row for the first time since the qualification for the 2013 Euro Series Challenge. Carlsen won his fourth Masters season on the back of winning the European Series Challenge against the Norwegian.

Satterfield, No. 8-cv-01062, and the complaint is being filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.","token_len":440,"entropy":[10.1068,2.5677,7.6092,0.2045,6.4913,3.0562,1.8851,7.0834,13.4632,11.6882,0.9859,9.6669,3.0257,0.5789,1.4116,0.1485,0.5981,1.7439,0.0152,4.0851,2.7642,5.9581,6.4561,6.2689,3.349,4.0365,2.9151,1.6476,7.4849,13.3554,1.5572,2.3772,1.0914,2.8513,6.0749,2.2478,5.364,0.0191,4.5387,0.2027,0.1939,0.0411,2.977,0.0099,0.0177,1.987,0.0269,0.5068,3.7894,8.0021,4.5636,0.2909,4.8015,4.9214,0.1831,3.7983,0.4836,0.4084,3.9105,0.0026,0.0085,0.0028,1.3612,1.5091,0.2606,0.7684,0.0024,0.037,0.7485,0.004,0.5187,3.6406,0.0007,2.6992,3.9217,1.9219,5.4332,0.0037,6.1527,0.2239,2.4645,5.1211,0.1828,3.4457,3.7693,6.169,1.3871,4.5151,3.3477,0.8959,4.0902,0.5533,0.4811,2.0598,6.0464,2.6223,0.1137,0.9247,3.5116,2.5946,1.3192,4.334,3.2873,0.4845,2.181,3.022,3.5456,0.0004,0.7585,0.5978,1.2814,0.0002,1.576,3.022,1.8742,4.2443,1.305,3.1382,3.6343,0.3217,3.8412,0.6831,4.6099,1.4284,3.9653,2.3858,2.6332,2.4332,0.0091,0.817,1.885,0.0957,0.7876,6.8141,0.8721,1.558,4.3556,0.0006,2.1653,1.7103,3.0843,0.2597,5.8957,0.6041,0.9151,3.7437,4.8049,0.6341,3.6369,0.0366,2.2485,6.2724,1.1476,5.7505,2.5652,9.8968,1.9429,5.4552,5.5157,7.3667,7.8135,2.1329,4.538,0.0035,4.8636,0.8683,1.2589,3.4236,5.2366,2.4173,1.1364,0.6533,2.6715,0.2924,0.41,0.0002,3.1878,0.0122,0.6476,1.1129,1.8603,0.0537,7.2271,1.9996,0.1859,6.3402,6.8837,2.3124,3.5783,6.6816,4.7964,3.7284,0.4164,8.025,4.1412,0.0191,0.0976,0.0399,0.1598,0.3141,0.0026,4.305,4.663,0.681,3.4594,1.5728,1.2393,3.3763,0.0009,0.0009,0.0029,0.1236,0.734,0.7536,0.0002,1.6908,1.8241,2.6836,4.3027,0.475,0.7727,3.8693,1.0235,4.141,3.9243,0.8613,1.3677,0.0117,5.5888,0.7559,3.3539,6.5179,6.0172,4.0164,0.5028,2.9407,6.1146,4.1736,2.3197,2.342,5.6996,1.3748,3.2322,3.8664,0.0114,3.0357,3.4558,1.3487,5.0689,3.7031,0.3347,0.6085,6.1389,4.2983,2.7669,1.7323,0.0485,6.6128,4.116,0.0114,3.0895,0.0003,0.3135,1.0026,2.8067,1.0179,2.0961,1.942,1.414,1.7792,0.0056,1.5942,0.0072,0.0921,0.0304,1.0064,0.0026,0.0187,0.0352,0.0007,2.3365,2.592,3.0527,0.349,2.9125,0.0005,0.0011,0.0036,0.197,0.0514,0.3279,0.2537,0.0002,2.6988,1.3616,2.8871,2.0275,1.268,1.2374,4.1684,0.0128,0.6222,3.9342,1.9289,0.0341,0.026,0.0048,1.3831,1.3316,3.6571,0.7992,4.0861,1.3075,2.484,0.2324,0.3454,0.1397,2.8324,0.5863,1.528,0.1801,0.1228,3.3686,2.152,2.7774,4.4168,1.8674,0.4028,1.6272,0.0025,0.5101,0.009,2.2545,5.0958,7.9537,1.8143,4.8099,0.1275,0.0474,0.7747,0.1034,4.6002,0.6285,0.3622,4.3733,5.3269,0.1138,0.8841,1.8494,4.2576,0.6114,0.5631,0.0002,0.0645,0.0581,0.3804,0.0002,6.3396,0.0005,0.0006,0.001,2.5703,0.8287,0.7616,1.4703,5.0343,3.7491,1.4623,3.0001,0.5364,3.0793,0.0005,0.0011,0.0021,0.5776,0.0228,6.8837,1.9124,2.7135,6.2878,3.039,2.8376,1.271,3.52,1.2695,1.7628,0.0151,0.0651,5.7228,2.7636,1.6952,5.7361,0.6304,0.0002,1.5784,3.4816,1.7594,2.7922,0.0048,0.0011,0.0122,7.4805,0.0343,1.4801,0.0578,5.2101,6.2057,1.3865,0.5091,1.6307,0.0063,3.8568,0.3995,1.1223,0.003,3.1507,5.0628,3.4409,1.2327,4.9924,2.1786,2.873,1.2492,4.1968,2.4695,0.9513,0.9729,1.8241,0.0033,0.1349,0.0074,0.0485,0.022,0.7972,0.0022,0.004,0.0186,0.001,0.6757]}
{"id":1731,"ended":true,"length":412,"text":"Liu Kang was the hero of the comic book adaptation of the Mortal Kombat series Malibu Comics. In the first miniseries, Blood and Thunder, his backstory was mostly kept intact as a young teenage boy, who had to grapple with his own identity as a young man.\n\nIn the second miniseries, Liu Kang has changed his name in order to allow the world to speak through him. But now, Liu Kang has grown old enough to tell the world through his character. His role in the stories, however, has evolved dramatically from the one he was in the MCU to the comic book and movie versions.\n\nOn one occasion, when he was working on a screenplay for the superhero miniseries, Liu Kang was talking to The San Jose Mercury News. In the interview, he says: \"It wasn't difficult to create a story that was actually good \u2014 that was the first really successful one I did. And that's how I used to live in the MCU.\"\n\nIn the first issue, Liu Kang revealed that there were some changes to his character. The first time he was killed was shortly before the movie ended. As Liu Kang has said repeatedly, he wanted to change and to be cool. In the next issue, Liu Kang talked about the changes and how his face changes.\n\nKang confirmed that in the second miniseries, Liu Kang has grown old enough to tell the world through his character. \"In fact, I know I have a lot older than him,\" Liu Kang said. \"But this is something I always wanted to do, and maybe it will become more important to make the characters that I played in the MCU. There is no need [to change him]. He is already the comic book character and the first major member of the MCU.\"\n\nIt is too soon to say if Liu Kang will stay with the series. But he will continue as the protagonist of the miniseries, which is published by DC. Liu Kang\u2019s time for the MCU is now over. He will be reprising his role in Malibu, and is likely to be featured in the sequel.","token_len":440,"entropy":[9.8463,6.3412,3.1681,2.9563,7.1944,0.5201,0.8025,7.9028,1.4152,3.4925,0.4403,1.5482,7.8795,0.1135,0.0,2.0027,13.9156,1.6538,2.4993,1.2714,3.0368,1.2453,3.6869,8.4514,0.0115,0.0001,0.6693,7.3557,4.1211,4.8031,0.6025,3.8396,7.0024,1.4924,5.6108,6.1441,5.1673,3.0597,1.8966,3.3358,6.5366,1.0397,1.4509,3.2711,2.9334,3.2888,5.5578,0.0412,1.9921,1.3716,3.382,1.3667,0.4413,5.5659,0.9206,0.7715,1.9423,0.0024,2.0058,0.9024,0.9295,1.2732,0.0004,0.0008,0.3484,5.4541,0.1057,4.1007,4.9819,1.8805,0.9989,4.1098,1.1429,0.0299,5.0956,2.5798,3.8765,0.2599,6.831,4.9982,0.3015,0.6327,5.5153,4.4015,1.0392,4.252,0.2122,1.7694,4.5666,3.7481,1.4278,0.1235,4.9339,1.2592,1.2584,4.854,1.1217,4.8859,1.248,3.77,5.1527,1.0841,0.5392,5.7844,3.3153,2.9425,0.1776,1.6493,4.1731,4.0923,3.2987,1.2904,3.2854,0.7099,1.6159,1.1813,1.0516,5.636,0.0081,3.6759,1.3725,6.7376,0.5296,4.585,2.85,1.5477,0.7026,0.9025,0.0002,4.9395,3.89,3.8575,0.2406,3.0581,2.0764,0.587,3.7002,0.656,1.6834,4.8044,0.3448,1.1695,6.2659,5.9742,0.0002,0.0004,2.0116,1.8629,0.0143,1.8664,5.2648,0.7168,5.5669,6.6006,2.8764,0.0139,0.0044,2.8544,3.4982,0.8151,2.2781,0.1157,0.7973,4.0437,2.2349,0.5916,2.9322,4.1062,0.0003,6.3741,0.9389,4.2649,1.2447,1.6344,1.2865,1.6103,5.1226,3.8724,6.0657,2.6686,0.9644,1.9452,3.4992,5.9553,3.3794,2.9932,2.1174,3.1783,0.8803,2.2757,2.5282,0.9962,2.169,0.7379,6.2815,0.4848,5.5173,3.6474,1.7325,5.5061,0.0018,1.4722,0.3772,0.0002,2.3884,0.8671,3.3134,3.2022,0.8723,0.7454,0.0111,5.4506,0.8011,5.2573,1.5634,3.1496,4.0281,1.0243,0.6175,1.3089,2.0655,2.9265,2.1616,2.8316,0.637,1.7532,4.9859,1.6056,6.724,1.4681,1.0352,3.5435,4.4602,0.7234,4.8767,2.745,0.0063,4.9493,3.0469,4.6802,0.7662,1.4831,3.2226,0.2975,3.6953,4.9134,4.3187,2.6372,5.8204,0.8751,2.5128,0.4353,4.0085,0.1773,0.1297,1.791,0.0021,6.0783,0.2582,2.1047,3.5844,2.8542,1.8355,3.2269,4.7425,4.5429,1.2463,1.1445,0.0001,4.6339,1.381,6.412,0.6201,3.0855,0.4187,1.5142,4.5977,0.005,0.0027,0.16,1.7332,0.0091,2.99,3.4275,1.8458,0.2055,0.1153,0.3971,0.0253,0.0548,0.0787,1.4803,0.0401,0.325,2.9128,3.0217,4.3992,0.1278,1.3436,5.5976,3.0266,2.7211,1.9946,2.4628,4.124,2.1671,2.6489,1.2497,1.3965,0.0019,0.6498,0.4123,0.4483,2.1913,4.3455,0.8842,3.6815,1.1986,4.2482,0.8958,0.0936,0.661,1.9304,1.1809,5.9869,2.2425,2.3184,3.9042,2.0632,2.4371,2.4385,4.0018,2.3719,2.9073,3.5325,1.7536,5.7793,2.8976,0.6725,1.9658,0.0016,2.9624,4.414,2.2566,2.253,3.9213,6.6381,0.678,1.212,1.5068,1.1226,2.4229,1.3873,4.5218,3.0026,6.0085,0.3067,1.7751,2.6174,2.4672,4.6567,5.1365,6.5527,0.1322,0.3656,1.4374,0.0018,1.3306,0.1163,0.0001,4.4314,1.5603,6.0729,1.4657,0.0401,0.8545,1.6312,0.8315,0.0007,0.4772,5.5465,2.2271,0.9286,3.9215,1.2168,2.6728,1.6506,2.5478,2.3166,4.2248,1.0994,4.1336,0.8921,0.4623,5.4374,0.0018,0.0001,1.6436,2.24,1.5511,4.8369,0.5928,2.5898,2.8381,2.8451,0.003,16.0297,7.2153,4.1345,7.1672,5.6257,1.1093,2.1981,0.0012,1.4676,2.6748,1.3188,0.357,2.8212,1.4806,1.8241,4.1468,0.3013,0.1737,0.2323,2.0715,3.6889,0.0003,3.9039,1.8986,4.059,4.2592,0.2736,2.0561,3.4637,0.5515,0.9781,3.8596,1.2453]}

{"id":3933,"ended":false,"length":395,"text":"During the period 1868 \u2013 1876, Sitting Bull developed into the most important of Native American political leaders. After the Treaty of Fort Laramie ( 1868 ) and the creation of the Great War between Pennsylvania and the Union Army, Sitting Bull became the chief negotiator for the Second Republic, the founding of the Confederacy, and the founding of the Union Republic in 1868, the Treaty of Washington and the First Amendment of the Constitution of the Union of 17th Amendment (1868 ). By the 1869 period, Sitting Bull became the face of the Second Republic and the foundation for the presidency and Senate, and the seat of the Federal Supreme Court. That year, Sitting Bull was assassinated. Following the assassination of the Founding Father, he held office for four years as the United States Senate leader.\n\nLater work\n\nFollowing the assassination of Sitting Bull, in April 1971, Sitting Bull received his first law degree from the City University of Washington. Sitting Bull was also a founding member of the Chicago chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union in 1975, and a member of the American Federation of Republican National Committee during the 1990s.\n\nLater life\n\nAfter the death of Sitting Bull in 1977, he was buried in Indiana. His death caused speculation and outrage in the United States as to whether he had indeed died of natural causes. A historical marker was created in his honor which depicts the man who had taken an active role in politics during the period, although this marker is not currently in storage. To this date, he remains buried at the Indiana State Cemetery.\n\n Biography\n\nSources\n\nFantasy literature\n\"Seat Bull on the Edge of Fear-Anastasia\" (1990)\n\"How We Worked in the White House\" (1998)\n\"The Secret History of the Lincoln Foundation\" (2001)\n \"Seat Bull, George \"Seat\" Fattman\" (2005)\n\"The Great War\" (2012)\n\"The Last Word\" (2012)\n\"It Was Not Going to Get Any Better: The Story of the Great War and Their First 100 Days\" (2013)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links","token_len":440,"entropy":[1.9437,5.2462,7.0356,4.5182,4.3176,1.0978,3.0178,0.4762,13.8539,2.3534,6.4828,4.0294,1.817,2.7503,2.8872,4.7878,8.8648,0.1032,4.8383,2.4676,0.723,4.6378,1.3667,5.6367,0.0196,2.8127,1.031,0.0064,0.0,3.6239,7.7421,1.0812,2.7011,1.6374,0.8255,5.1213,0.0108,0.2494,4.8595,4.3147,3.873,6.1752,0.038,2.8261,1.6733,4.9395,0.983,0.7132,0.0005,2.1702,1.1394,3.6363,4.0361,1.3355,0.574,6.391,5.4059,2.2469,2.1343,4.0645,1.3069,0.404,3.8852,0.7377,0.4727,0.6676,2.6702,0.0361,0.166,5.5152,5.4832,3.402,1.3467,3.43,3.1306,2.7098,5.3615,0.0533,4.8721,2.0513,0.9247,4.1466,3.9967,2.7672,0.0203,1.3958,1.7712,0.0897,5.4255,4.6084,2.9051,7.8533,1.3693,3.3456,2.1804,0.2825,2.6816,4.65,1.3491,4.2351,3.1607,4.7178,0.3929,1.1546,0.0003,3.244,0.8328,5.1692,0.0734,0.6602,5.2884,0.4087,1.5222,1.0732,6.1328,2.1952,0.4563,5.7578,3.1459,5.0666,2.6007,1.6975,2.2349,6.8937,0.2385,0.8877,4.6511,7.2282,0.0262,1.1394,6.7947,1.7513,0.3329,1.6838,0.0002,1.5151,4.0009,2.5197,4.4818,0.8148,0.5661,0.6839,2.9423,5.3926,0.9171,0.8718,3.818,5.2909,3.1178,1.3741,3.3166,1.013,3.0901,1.7195,3.1743,0.0097,3.4363,3.7178,1.0637,2.079,0.0105,6.2,9.1521,2.0229,0.0002,4.1223,0.5467,1.7896,0.1273,1.324,0.002,0.7644,4.2237,5.1447,5.8823,0.2899,3.6929,0.0022,4.0633,1.9487,1.7972,5.3567,0.1896,0.7924,1.1166,6.1328,0.2245,0.026,7.5031,0.9328,4.2652,0.0008,1.7735,2.6226,1.4483,2.3116,0.4399,0.0431,0.1939,5.9243,3.3064,0.012,0.1096,1.7385,1.386,0.0277,0.0082,4.3201,4.1663,1.5068,0.8676,2.3792,1.3118,0.0308,0.1356,2.3041,3.5312,0.1562,8.4329,7.9734,0.4151,3.2285,0.2518,3.9139,0.5994,0.2267,1.2237,0.0003,5.2451,3.021,0.2945,0.0001,3.4571,2.0711,1.8225,0.0453,0.7027,0.0009,0.6378,4.1232,0.0815,1.2186,1.7205,3.1519,0.5158,7.6281,1.1213,2.0848,3.828,4.8452,6.0642,3.2574,3.8658,1.4141,0.434,1.7033,0.0161,3.679,0.5944,1.2098,1.2223,1.3671,6.5588,1.1408,1.9825,0.7758,0.0023,0.4966,3.71,7.441,3.2731,1.3972,4.5217,1.4729,3.4294,0.523,4.2612,4.7733,1.7806,4.7411,1.242,2.5201,4.7352,4.9016,2.6715,0.8874,0.069,4.8974,2.7105,0.8525,2.9372,3.9341,5.3958,2.8037,1.5049,1.7529,1.5699,4.3637,1.935,8.4624,0.2869,6.1394,3.1721,2.2101,0.2313,3.849,3.3488,2.174,2.6471,1.0213,4.4322,1.688,2.4821,0.9632,4.6465,23.1844,0.4798,0.504,0.0002,5.3994,0.7263,0.0003,6.183,6.8149,6.7871,0.7181,12.2536,3.5633,7.7217,0.3214,5.2295,0.9311,5.6641,0.1734,6.707,6.8351,5.7577,7.3389,0.0731,1.8855,1.7779,5.6295,0.7947,1.2465,10.9125,6.1308,4.9103,6.5922,2.4207,2.2936,0.7646,4.7068,0.1719,0.8927,0.1352,3.5551,0.0541,0.2131,9.9005,1.7365,4.899,1.7816,0.058,0.7716,4.7966,7.2771,0.4303,0.0312,2.8355,0.0183,0.2305,8.0266,3.1769,0.5118,0.0285,3.331,5.4417,5.3062,5.211,1.3175,2.4132,6.352,6.9647,5.1318,2.3473,2.064,3.2564,0.0347,0.2937,8.1481,1.5463,3.7011,1.1147,1.9024,0.1158,3.2189,0.0168,0.3713,6.8093,1.3761,4.7948,4.4421,0.4691,0.0301,2.3935,0.0087,0.4016,7.3225,6.0514,2.1711,3.2568,6.7631,0.5646,4.5753,1.1005,0.4993,4.0348,1.3651,2.8585,0.0449,1.217,3.554,1.2403,2.6167,6.504,6.8295,5.4191,0.6439,0.3643,0.0244,1.9827,0.0078,0.2845,0.006,5.1109,0.7803,0.0005,5.9353,0.3235]}

The race course is a major attraction to runners, who spend a lot of time in the river.\n\nGallery\n\nSee also\nList of major city and towns of Somalia\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n World-renowned tourist destinations in Somalia - Mogadishu, Somalia (Mogadishu International Airport)","token_len":440,"entropy":[12.0412,0.3111,8.0626,4.8481,12.4633,2.7689,0.0004,1.2981,3.1261,0.0718,2.1075,5.3995,3.3947,6.0564,6.3523,1.3547,0.001,1.6572,1.8946,3.8187,6.2802,7.9566,0.3333,1.9395,1.6881,0.1893,1.1325,8.7242,6.5381,5.1744,1.7677,4.3508,3.0429,0.0012,0.5346,0.3467,1.8957,8.5109,4.6209,6.151,0.1441,1.3716,0.6087,0.0118,0.7078,2.1386,1.835,5.7392,1.6728,5.5313,2.5315,2.6993,0.2926,0.0014,1.4544,1.1809,2.1248,3.404,2.8464,3.2598,1.4354,4.4509,0.9209,5.1853,0.763,0.4489,2.3711,0.2213,4.9016,1.1067,0.6308,3.0818,0.0628,0.0015,5.929,3.1869,5.1382,0.0202,2.8979,3.2983,2.4592,2.0266,2.8794,5.2301,0.3597,0.4362,3.4831,4.2046,4.5128,0.1631,1.285,0.7553,1.4867,5.5794,2.0198,1.6939,3.4167,2.8685,0.9338,1.7505,0.0062,1.9874,6.5881,1.5708,0.6465,0.3795,0.0538,0.002,2.594,1.7754,1.4371,3.0666,4.6565,7.1084,0.0198,0.1537,6.4274,1.6687,5.9247,0.401,0.3628,0.3968,0.6239,1.5801,4.4204,0.1895,0.9204,7.1954,2.5783,2.3831,0.2149,0.6554,2.087,0.0002,6.1477,4.617,1.3258,0.1288,0.0071,0.0017,1.9688,0.0001,1.997,0.0631,0.0493,0.0031,5.5488,5.5299,2.835,0.7868,1.9335,0.7069,4.3401,1.4538,1.9394,0.0013,0.3435,3.0648,0.0032,0.0682,0.5112,1.731,0.9492,1.1088,4.9999,3.0862,1.6111,0.0097,0.0858,3.2293,6.0477,0.4043,5.9123,2.7418,0.2678,0.5008,0.9455,1.8576,1.507,1.9167,0.1764,0.1373,5.1245,0.0124,5.1608,0.2571,0.0042,5.214,0.5279,4.8166,0.0516,0.5867,1.3708,0.0001,4.8018,2.0211,19.3089,0.0224,0.0074,0.0023,2.2189,3.8186,1.5619,3.673,4.8611,2.2405,3.5515,0.1374,1.4763,0.7629,0.6764,0.7099,0.8426,1.5602,0.9619,1.3945,1.3508,3.2672,0.8214,0.0415,2.2855,4.2687,0.1054,0.0058,1.4183,0.6673,2.6548,1.309,1.2109,3.0654,3.3598,3.7769,6.0723,5.2408,2.8132,5.4292,0.4867,2.3172,0.1161,1.5699,0.0026,0.0019,1.0786,2.1279,1.4957,1.2305,8.3654,1.8853,1.3766,4.683,0.0486,1.055,4.6369,2.8126,0.5492,2.1229,5.3322,0.0035,0.0065,2.6929,0.6283,0.1753,0.0062,8.1805,0.5032,4.3337,3.2925,2.7665,1.2693,4.5365,0.4926,3.0033,4.9818,0.0032,5.4216,0.9496,0.1302,1.1403,1.7986,4.1893,0.7659,2.5176,3.807,0.3526,2.7544,0.0014,1.1255,3.3803,0.0075,1.2698,2.9435,0.0201,0.004,2.7946,0.0421,1.1874,2.1958,4.3154,0.9444,3.4023,1.5814,5.6591,3.3231,2.2655,4.9524,0.0201,0.1491,7.25,0.012,6.0032,9.5359,0.3863,0.3303,0.6749,0.0002,1.6892,0.1261,0.0022,0.0023,1.2557,2.0529,4.1133,0.3721,0.7955,4.4833,0.1305,2.7075,1.9035,7.3127,8.3765,1.4457,4.2393,0.0013,1.0546,1.802,3.6002,4.8064,4.7013,2.2547,1.2936,6.5189,4.3441,5.1905,3.3442,0.0017,0.7794,4.4172,3.7079,1.2314,6.5643,0.607,1.2404,4.4218,0.6365,2.5596,6.2558,3.1093,4.0639,3.207,2.6288,5.8634,3.7731,4.2114,0.3047,4.5196,6.7439,2.0638,3.9616,0.2035,0.2854,5.5379,1.4264,0.6744,1.3444,2.4965,1.6205,0.9038,2.5783,4.5194,2.2042,2.2583,3.8326,1.5608,2.2227,4.6783,2.3331,1.4184,0.0189,0.1331,1.4796,0.3987,5.2376,1.8413,1.1342,0.0002,6.6438,0.3409,0.0002,2.8722,0.2657,1.5427,22.8301,0.0067,4.862,3.0818,2.4884,4.163,3.0823,1.7529,0.8937,0.0001,2.3175,1.4184,0.0004,4.0709,0.3773,1.502,21.0669,4.8692,3.4973,0.0171,4.9773,4.382,1.7845,0.4251,4.5085,3.585,0.0013,0.0012,1.8313,1.7268,3.0694,4.3197,0.3381,0.0659,0.0046,2.1034,0.0381,1.0644]}

{"id":663,"ended":true,"length":381,"text":"The chanonry, referred to in the cathedral's chartulary as the college of the chanonry or simply as the college, was the collection of the canons'manses that were grouped around the church of the chanonry. The canton of Canning (canning-d, the chanonry, usually refers to a small country village of about 100\u00a0km from London) was originally built by Canning people in the 14th century. The chapel was built with many local stone tools to be used for altar and other things.\n\nIt consists of a very large chanonry, a large and imposing chapel and an altar. The chapel has a high altar as well.\n\nThe cathedral was placed in the Gothic style in 1649, and in 1665 was used as a building on the corner of Westgate Lane and Peter Road in west London and its current location is still in good condition. The cathedral also has a few minor buildings constructed, but is in many respects the more modern and modern model of the church.\n\nThere was a large church church at the beginning of the 19th century, which was used for mass and funerals. However, in 1858 it was taken down and replaced by a chapel built in the same type of style as the Chanonry Chapel. The Chapel is still up, but it is in many respects a more expensive (and perhaps less functional) building.\n\nIn addition, although the chapel dates back to 1660, the church date has long since been dated. The Chanonry Chapel, built in 1556, was constructed in 1812.\n\nA small chapel, that consists of a narrow chanonry (often called the \"champion\" in the Bible), was built in 1808 and the chanonry tower was finished in 1817. While the first chanonry tower was built in Canning, the chanonry tower was sold to a London architect about 1846 and the tower was reconstructed around 1904.\n\nThe tower was rebuilt in the 1970s and still stands, although it has been abandoned due to vandalism. The chapel is likely to be rebuilt in the future.","token_len":443,"entropy":[8.3628,11.0554,10.4341,4.7933,8.797,0.0453,1.7049,0.9782,11.9291,2.2748,8.5296,9.7193,0.2963,1.0622,1.4081,11.3195,1.5625,1.3979,3.7636,0.4561,0.1114,4.4535,7.1936,3.0231,0.5438,1.6264,3.2375,1.6978,2.3178,7.4459,0.1147,1.9103,9.4243,0.3104,15.7635,6.3695,6.4018,4.0114,1.9513,7.0174,4.6276,0.795,4.7927,3.3126,1.6988,2.49,0.0341,0.0286,0.8722,1.4039,4.87,1.1922,2.1982,5.3955,7.1888,3.4421,4.1161,1.9521,4.1301,4.8738,5.7561,3.6654,2.9041,0.2386,0.2825,2.8169,6.8896,3.9357,0.0108,2.9259,4.9147,6.1066,4.9921,3.4315,1.93,2.8841,12.336,5.2737,2.6893,6.2512,0.9415,0.9966,4.8411,4.555,1.7338,5.5946,0.0306,6.4523,1.3172,1.5287,3.1073,0.1297,0.1826,1.0017,1.4555,5.5217,1.8798,2.2839,4.286,5.8242,6.4515,5.3966,3.3184,4.1692,3.6943,0.7608,2.2903,4.2081,2.262,3.5531,4.6054,0.725,2.7247,6.5249,3.7549,7.0568,0.0599,1.4464,5.137,1.158,3.6736,1.4504,0.0396,1.638,3.2422,2.0713,4.876,5.2736,2.265,2.4554,2.8929,2.3924,1.6161,1.2766,1.8578,2.58,1.113,4.6819,2.3506,5.6521,0.4216,2.8348,1.9091,0.0009,1.054,3.7768,2.1558,5.8319,0.9821,1.0428,6.1493,0.7313,2.6339,2.6397,4.4258,1.6975,1.9556,3.3699,1.9865,4.0617,2.3885,4.7613,0.8107,0.5575,4.0206,3.4701,0.6372,5.5306,0.0297,4.7599,3.5391,3.791,0.237,6.9274,4.2862,2.4444,5.0802,0.1294,4.5202,4.9179,5.3087,1.0661,0.8249,3.4005,2.8133,5.7146,0.9746,0.2531,1.655,1.5561,3.7425,1.6096,0.7669,4.4378,4.7189,4.1787,7.101,3.3323,2.5269,4.2673,3.2997,5.0654,1.6142,2.5226,3.7266,1.8024,2.2453,1.5898,6.2421,0.7517,0.551,3.1126,0.8974,0.9114,0.0006,3.4869,2.7844,0.8091,2.9266,2.8046,4.0059,2.5773,1.425,3.6992,0.0775,0.2276,2.1246,0.0045,0.066,1.3255,2.4175,0.952,3.6354,1.4602,5.2645,1.8451,3.7481,0.1339,0.9388,4.4239,0.3531,2.1153,2.36,3.9359,1.7895,0.2095,3.7381,2.0291,1.4474,1.9924,0.4334,0.6292,3.3539,3.1235,1.307,1.0764,3.041,6.1333,0.9712,0.391,2.4087,0.3916,10.3116,3.2613,0.0324,2.4545,0.8382,1.6559,3.4527,2.7366,1.9711,5.7702,3.6702,0.9796,1.8348,1.0305,2.7176,2.643,0.6548,1.578,2.3806,6.3274,5.6849,1.2673,4.5605,2.3114,3.9458,0.1008,2.0654,0.9007,0.7032,0.0003,2.6058,3.9069,1.2579,5.0654,0.8847,2.6565,6.6608,0.5874,0.3761,2.7384,3.9193,0.4096,1.7425,3.0097,6.5365,3.2337,5.0597,0.5876,0.9975,5.335,2.0172,1.5082,4.6897,0.0113,0.0046,0.2269,3.221,3.2627,0.6087,3.3888,4.5929,0.5121,0.8839,4.2289,1.0222,3.4493,4.3265,1.7311,1.7428,0.0004,3.7261,3.7147,1.1996,2.7765,4.8513,6.3041,0.1219,0.9045,5.8178,3.8332,1.0797,0.0326,3.3281,4.9919,1.4328,1.2678,2.6898,2.0694,6.4248,2.8646,3.19,0.9558,5.599,0.5557,1.1735,0.5831,0.769,2.5585,4.7312,2.4111,3.1611,3.1058,0.2916,0.0119,5.9448,0.9702,5.2889,0.0978,0.6627,3.9335,0.2368,5.8674,0.8883,5.5128,1.3825,0.1016,0.0169,0.8662,0.4827,1.0262,0.5264,5.499,0.0097,1.3368,0.9998,1.8833,0.0505,0.0103,0.4205,0.9494,7.878,1.0951,2.8445,4.092,4.7826,6.9033,2.0793,4.9233,2.6619,1.4649,1.7074,0.5646,6.0882,4.2059,5.6155,0.3362,0.794,0.0002,1.136,4.2683,1.1907,4.1262,0.965,2.2469,3.9086,0.0668,1.1986,4.3692,1.5169,2.2174,2.6191,1.0204,1.6022,1.2495,4.33,2.6231,0.0075,3.719,0.6903,1.6938,3.1741,1.7722,6.839,0.6194,0.8883,3.5418,1.582,0.4605,0.6471,0.8874]}

{"id":2799,"ended":true,"length":376,"text":"Phase 2 of the Fens Waterway project involves the link between Donington Bridge and Crowland and Cowbit Washes, which are located on the River Welland near Spalding. In order to make the financing available the project needs the approval of the local council, who has a strong local sense of community and involvement with the community, while continuing a strategic commitment to preserve the Fens Waterway from the existing development of the current waterway to the new waterway. The Fens Waterway project will be the final leg of a much longer, comprehensive and interconnected project that includes water quality monitoring, the transfer of the existing water and sewerage infrastructure, and significant repairs to the current waterway infrastructure.\n\nFor more information about the Fens Waterway Project click here.\n\nNotes and references\n\n1. The Fens Waterway Project is a project to be developed alongside the planned Fens Waterway. The Fens Waterway project is the site for a new waterway that will connect the Fens Waterway site with the remaining areas of both the former Fens Waterway and the Greenbelt. For detailed information about the project click here.\n\n2. The Fens Waterway project project will be operated and funded by the local government and is managed by the local authority providing water to the existing existing community drinking water. Water from both Waterways will be provided to the community.\n\n3. In connection with the new waterway, the existing Fens Waterway is being developed on a site that is approximately one of the most beautiful Rivers in England, but also contains potential to be particularly attractive to young people to explore the Fens region and explore the potential to enhance a new national park.\n\n4. The current Fens Waterway system is a mixed use of old and new development with more than 100,000 houses and businesses being built, many of them in the Fens Waterway.\n\n5. The existing Fens Waterway remains under construction, but the new Fens Waterway is on its way to being completed.\n\n6. Prior to completion of the project the Fens Waterway is likely to be permanently re-used.","token_len":444,"entropy":[5.5134,3.0739,1.2669,6.2724,8.9546,8.9481,3.9479,3.7122,5.3311,2.2571,9.1281,0.3919,8.1551,5.1933,4.6566,0.3735,9.582,4.4463,3.8343,8.1234,11.388,8.3435,7.6985,2.2658,1.8939,2.316,3.396,1.6672,0.7263,4.7889,6.8579,7.9717,4.177,7.2684,4.0012,0.0048,1.4688,3.9988,2.8395,0.0713,3.4227,1.19,11.1003,3.0731,5.0615,2.2438,2.8233,3.3053,1.6815,0.0563,0.6644,3.2689,2.6635,2.0228,3.1177,2.6992,2.9341,3.3581,5.4152,5.5463,0.2354,2.1428,1.5507,5.6274,1.7096,0.8058,2.444,3.6492,4.5436,5.0777,5.6993,5.9901,2.832,0.1181,6.0348,0.9314,4.2999,0.0132,0.3976,0.0096,4.0547,2.1103,5.6269,3.7343,3.3403,1.1476,4.1937,4.0105,0.1321,4.2518,0.7849,2.6432,3.3941,0.0165,0.576,1.9841,1.9529,0.0246,0.1228,0.0057,1.9708,1.9646,1.6038,3.5061,3.8808,5.2001,0.0609,1.4415,5.045,1.8962,1.948,4.8523,2.4934,6.3372,1.3218,1.3034,2.5405,5.9518,2.7258,2.4603,0.4464,4.1828,6.0147,0.0996,2.8087,2.5302,1.5653,5.3362,1.2428,1.4204,2.7089,1.0279,1.2904,5.2022,5.4788,0.9088,0.8086,3.7207,1.9906,0.514,3.8675,0.4285,1.1265,0.001,4.6028,0.7714,0.0668,1.3357,0.4773,1.1742,0.004,0.039,0.0066,3.1376,3.2193,0.1394,0.2876,0.6675,0.0002,6.4496,3.5828,1.7253,1.2016,0.0002,2.1411,0.6922,2.2485,1.419,0.0237,0.0555,0.0074,1.0945,1.6674,1.7435,3.1322,3.3877,4.0112,3.8069,5.9382,0.4557,5.9751,2.3908,0.1288,0.9761,0.2222,2.7274,1.3313,1.3123,0.0188,0.049,0.0063,1.7964,1.07,2.9138,7.1555,2.0027,1.7752,1.8656,2.6731,0.1216,2.1949,0.5405,1.3371,1.143,1.7226,0.0083,0.6141,0.0241,5.7787,0.9739,0.7587,6.6131,5.1928,0.2363,6.5412,1.2119,4.8638,1.9839,0.0433,0.2057,0.0134,0.499,0.75,5.0273,2.587,1.2676,5.0529,5.2097,0.4872,1.303,0.3508,1.4465,1.0967,0.0199,0.0896,0.2896,0.0002,0.2178,0.0009,1.0172,0.9281,0.0074,0.017,0.0036,1.5944,5.2343,3.0164,0.968,5.5512,3.3615,1.4323,0.37,0.4772,3.427,0.8019,2.1388,3.0802,4.0405,0.2276,0.4939,2.9309,2.246,6.0899,4.8987,2.4899,0.3958,4.2581,6.3524,6.008,7.5325,0.1859,2.9375,4.6382,3.7453,3.1907,5.6196,2.0795,0.6526,0.2547,1.9579,1.1532,0.6045,2.4365,2.3564,0.9841,0.0001,0.2648,0.001,3.8535,4.9293,0.0104,0.5142,4.5187,1.5928,0.0258,1.6068,0.7027,4.6101,1.2713,0.0103,0.0254,0.0038,2.3896,1.5131,2.495,3.5183,1.1839,2.7145,1.9845,1.278,4.1262,3.5336,6.367,0.1876,1.5958,3.8217,9.2086,0.4793,4.7955,2.0346,4.9701,2.9638,3.2352,6.9129,3.528,1.2323,6.2351,2.0639,0.9114,5.2592,1.2925,5.0481,2.452,1.4258,4.123,0.0033,6.6313,1.9223,4.0615,0.8771,3.1147,3.0584,4.8322,5.2403,3.9996,5.6415,2.4072,1.0437,1.1172,0.0002,0.2595,0.0012,0.8207,4.572,0.8369,0.0088,0.0323,0.0024,5.8615,0.9861,2.576,4.48,2.6456,4.3711,5.5699,0.4665,0.0523,3.2362,2.8872,5.4292,2.004,3.0976,2.3865,0.0067,5.4811,1.2864,3.6128,3.1382,0.4099,3.1603,2.7284,0.3343,1.3194,2.1708,0.8955,1.8689,0.0092,2.3852,0.0177,1.6192,1.7751,0.0002,0.1514,0.0011,0.8103,3.3479,0.3956,0.0068,0.0342,0.0027,5.5619,3.3354,1.0743,2.1311,1.9404,1.6581,2.6637,1.2497,0.008,0.0167,0.0032,1.648,4.9997,3.0324,0.6821,0.6666,1.379,1.3003,0.7748,0.8307,0.0002,0.2142,0.0014,5.6165,0.0339,2.8971,0.3007,0.1321,2.2968,1.5006,0.7074,0.0069,0.0411,0.0065,2.566,4.7948,0.0075,0.8341,5.8336,5.1121,0.354,1.0777,2.1832]}

{"id":823,"ended":false,"length":408,"text":"Gordon was again arrested on 13 January 2004. Police said at the time that the murder file had never been closed, and that the arrest followed new leads. These new leads were quickly met by authorities who determined Gordon had committed the crime in a separate home. Police said that the evidence gathered by the detectives against Gordon made it clear that Gordon had committed the murder.\n\nOn 6 February 2005, four people were found guilty of murdering Gordon, all of them guilty of murder. Gordon\u2019s name was put on the death register in the United States.\n\nAt one point, Gordon was described as having a dark, violent past due to early involvement in two drug conspiracy cases against Mexican cartel leader El Chapo. Gordon himself became involved in the murders of a Spanish journalist in January 1984. He was not arrested by police until January 1986.\n\nGordon was a frequent participant in the 1985 drug cartel massacre during which a 30-year-old Mexican drug cartel man was killed in a shootout with police. Several of the alleged perpetrators fled the area and were killed in their tracks. The following year his name was put on the death certificate of a former client, Mexican drug kingpin Salvador Castro, who had previously been convicted of plotting and carrying out the murder of Mexican drug kingpin Mario Castillo in 1988.\n\nFollowing his conviction in 1985 as part of the US Drug Enforcement Administration, Oliver Oliver Oliver left the Mexican drug cartel following the murder of another Mexican drug kingpin. Oliver Oliver entered the United States after a few years and moved to San Luis Potosi, Guanajuato where he was working to prepare the murder charge against the American-Mexican former Mexican drug kingpin. He was arrested on 20 September 1988 and arrested by the US Drug Enforcement Administration, and made a $50,000 bond. He also spent most of this time in prison awaiting execution to death.\n\nOn 21 March 1989, the prosecution of Oliver Oliver died. He was released on 19 April 1993.\n\nBibliography\n Gordon is a book that addresses themes of drug trafficking, political injustice, and prison life. He is among the best-selling literature on the subject of organized crime in the United States.\n\nReferences","token_len":446,"entropy":[4.7983,7.5165,4.3911,2.0027,7.6953,3.2393,4.6795,1.6549,4.6575,1.7904,5.0605,0.5704,0.0276,0.917,2.4027,6.3049,10.8269,1.4246,5.2606,0.1273,3.1392,2.3049,1.0995,1.0445,1.9406,4.9269,7.0103,7.255,4.1434,0.818,7.1623,1.3088,0.1089,2.2508,5.1455,5.0402,1.3408,5.1446,1.4586,5.0563,9.7304,1.1722,2.5403,1.2257,1.0197,2.7081,1.9008,4.1907,3.8708,0.9927,3.4489,1.379,1.2782,1.9314,4.5444,5.0087,1.8067,0.6803,3.1068,5.8996,0.5808,5.2981,0.7852,1.1126,0.2339,3.0215,0.7942,2.0678,0.4407,1.1859,1.0411,1.4849,0.0047,2.6002,3.8088,1.0435,1.8566,0.3288,5.555,3.741,0.5813,2.4688,1.4684,0.2217,2.1615,2.0199,2.1883,3.5412,0.6502,1.3426,6.7525,0.478,1.9541,0.3767,3.1973,16.3891,8.7418,3.4034,6.1152,0.4584,5.7066,0.7425,0.8222,3.2323,3.8999,2.3374,2.5049,4.142,0.7711,1.4649,1.8146,0.0003,4.5647,4.4628,0.326,0.9089,2.1281,1.3869,4.8888,0.3277,1.8165,1.3167,4.5223,1.8707,6.5101,2.9537,6.5888,0.1305,7.2252,3.8004,0.2576,5.7748,3.0309,6.5764,1.199,4.3959,7.0167,3.7091,2.5098,3.7981,0.2408,0.0031,0.6003,2.3571,6.4198,5.0394,1.8341,0.2197,1.4379,4.2677,0.6955,3.576,6.0158,4.0665,1.9019,5.8321,5.0724,1.522,2.6296,0.8371,5.4317,2.6465,3.6229,1.1729,1.3389,3.5837,3.4732,0.7481,0.6468,0.0002,1.5139,1.2764,3.0135,4.6059,3.7803,0.1062,1.523,5.7707,3.3116,3.2619,5.29,5.9763,0.4978,3.2231,6.63,0.1388,0.11,0.164,0.0012,1.7937,3.0003,1.1538,4.0509,0.8139,0.4484,2.0664,1.0049,0.7085,0.4123,0.8625,0.4398,5.8504,2.1597,0.4767,4.0164,3.4312,4.942,1.5733,3.0488,1.9097,1.1608,3.7732,1.4375,3.701,4.0125,0.4298,2.5321,4.6734,0.5913,7.4846,2.1004,0.1837,3.2633,0.1131,0.2244,0.4834,4.5214,1.4239,1.3686,3.8193,7.4555,2.523,6.1766,0.9017,1.9046,0.0017,6.3903,6.4678,1.559,0.7068,1.6879,4.5323,0.5231,1.5455,0.3366,5.9196,2.6699,3.224,0.015,0.9629,2.3216,0.1023,4.1528,1.5002,0.6792,0.0051,6.5692,4.8559,0.8834,2.1958,4.0355,0.0834,0.5448,0.0002,4.8315,2.0102,2.6037,1.7644,2.5159,6.7371,2.8176,0.0005,1.5039,5.2825,2.1104,0.2147,0.2683,2.0718,8.1776,5.3662,4.7618,7.2372,1.297,3.3049,1.5063,0.7574,5.0727,1.4935,3.1807,0.0569,5.5361,1.8761,0.8286,0.5382,0.0004,1.9214,1.831,0.5895,6.3321,0.7767,1.3193,0.0126,4.1855,2.919,4.5898,0.4139,3.7184,3.8058,0.354,3.2009,4.3844,0.3423,0.0917,0.7104,8.2948,0.4001,0.0017,0.0004,5.059,0.0953,1.8384,4.3512,4.1029,6.1374,3.0848,4.3446,4.1669,0.6054,2.3608,5.6609,4.5262,2.7866,0.0011,5.771,3.3982,0.7857,0.3053,0.0006,1.9685,2.2869,1.0038,1.7964,1.8531,3.7826,3.1059,3.0747,1.3164,5.6153,3.0425,0.9842,1.602,2.2924,0.0166,0.3016,3.3879,2.926,6.1546,1.3562,4.2117,2.8775,0.1002,0.0028,1.3319,0.4502,2.0194,3.9857,4.0339,5.048,0.0052,4.4671,0.1644,0.4564,2.1377,3.2914,5.2133,6.2595,7.8252,0.5532,0.5725,0.0002,2.2488,3.2722,2.4216,1.3616,0.1648,2.5215,5.7685,2.1859,1.3436,0.0286,5.4366,1.6494,1.9204,0.4231,5.4644,1.1433,5.3232,1.5686,5.2517,0.9567,0.9376,0.0002,5.9681,1.135,0.5713,22.9149,5.1569,2.1431,5.1997,1.9158,4.9905,7.2678,0.9865,3.2463,1.6751,0.7641,5.0757,6.5891,0.4589,0.8333,5.7939,2.3745,0.6923,2.8597,1.2771,5.9493,0.3704,2.9163,1.005,1.8668,8.6081,1.1959,1.0002,0.5972,1.6742,5.7073,0.0984,0.9695,0.5618,0.2926,0.0013,0.4864,1.6291,0.0003,4.5375]}

{"id":4062,"ended":false,"length":378,"text":"On 27 November 1880, Boycott, his family and a local magistrate were escorted from Lough Mask House by members of the 19th Hussars. A carriage had been hired for the family, which proceeded to the French town of Port Saint-Jossaise to take home the stolen gold and coins. Soon, the regiment made two attempts to flee on foot but, once in the midst of the police, fled in a private carriage.\n\nBy the time the French General's regiment got to Port Saint-Jossaise, the regiment had broken through the French wall into its own tunnel. The regiment, along with his personal assistant, Pierre Taur\u00e8s, escaped from the tunnel and had set out from there.\n\nThe soldiers had to be rescued because men were trapped beneath the snow to avoid falling upon people. The town of Port Saint-Jossaise was badly damaged and many were killed during the attack.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, in order for the French Governor and his personal assistant Pierre Taur\u00e8s to escape, the soldiers tried to escape through a tunnel but were unsuccessful.\n\nMeanwhile, the French officer who was stationed in Port Saint-Jossaise and who also managed to escape from the tunnel, took refuge in a nearby cave and made his way to the English colony, where he was taken as part of the British Expeditionary Force, where he was awarded the rank of colonel. On the 29 March, he was transferred out of the army and transferred to the small Belgian garrison. On the 30th of April, he was captured in Saint-Brunswick by the Germans and taken to Paris. Later, he served in the French Forces in the Netherlands from 20 September to 8 April. On the 31st of September, he was captured in Grenada by the British Army and was taken to the British Colony of Guadeloupe. His captors were sent to the island of Grenada for a short time, but the British government was persuaded of his capture.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nIn the French Museum of the French Revolution\nThe British Archives\n\nPort Saint-Jossaise\nThe French Revolution","token_len":447,"entropy":[8.9762,2.9298,10.0581,0.3757,10.8127,3.3165,3.2338,11.3459,3.5952,1.7215,4.1962,3.7751,7.2078,2.0054,6.8858,1.3169,7.0543,2.8747,14.0787,4.2543,1.0752,4.5516,0.0225,0.3269,8.9108,0.0657,7.6867,1.128,1.6843,3.4687,8.0115,4.3558,0.7935,4.3885,1.5341,1.0185,4.4826,1.8524,2.3469,5.6805,0.8676,1.6837,7.0031,3.2791,0.1841,5.8527,5.7902,0.2734,4.5095,9.3024,3.5123,9.1228,3.0863,3.0435,5.9174,1.7422,5.8736,3.6425,2.1097,5.1754,0.7235,5.7413,3.1106,1.2691,6.7021,5.0055,6.6779,4.2944,0.3288,5.3049,4.3144,0.4308,3.0192,4.315,4.6002,2.1199,1.3704,5.548,0.0036,0.8752,6.7074,0.6641,5.5215,2.598,1.2209,5.0539,2.3241,1.0264,1.8673,0.0063,4.2245,1.4335,1.3014,0.6669,4.4254,6.6769,4.1529,3.2822,5.1617,1.1392,1.1274,0.1106,0.0193,0.0861,0.0005,0.0004,0.001,0.4778,1.3517,3.7098,0.4733,3.9463,1.0304,0.7417,3.056,4.9233,4.9142,4.8107,1.4062,8.1325,1.2985,1.421,2.2508,3.2517,4.4191,0.0013,5.4931,4.839,4.5791,0.7199,5.7095,5.1667,5.9216,6.5118,1.5219,0.1831,4.1551,2.4688,0.4599,1.506,1.5517,4.2336,4.2781,1.102,3.5169,3.2513,0.9328,1.8135,0.0001,1.5634,5.0023,2.7936,3.8692,3.2273,2.5391,5.3537,7.3889,1.284,3.4489,3.7919,0.2781,5.4609,5.264,4.2081,1.9564,5.2523,7.4022,1.2181,1.5797,5.9419,2.1842,1.5078,0.0818,0.0067,0.0551,0.0015,0.0005,0.0026,0.7583,5.2375,0.729,1.2358,3.4392,3.3811,1.4404,3.2136,0.136,2.5855,0.2941,1.04,0.0002,5.4821,0.0044,4.577,0.4458,0.1986,4.3795,3.0356,3.4978,0.2947,3.0822,7.2815,3.6296,1.5588,4.18,0.9655,3.8233,0.4456,0.0008,0.0039,0.0018,0.0974,1.5623,1.0449,1.1879,2.5209,5.2033,0.124,2.8032,2.1435,0.9713,2.1622,2.6254,0.8379,3.8446,0.2966,1.4889,0.0002,4.9738,0.1764,1.1638,2.6781,5.8173,2.1634,1.8346,5.2013,1.3201,1.1643,0.0414,0.0035,0.0308,0.0022,0.0002,0.0026,3.4998,1.2323,4.624,3.4845,0.1172,0.5643,2.4208,0.1872,0.5376,0.9582,5.43,2.0062,0.5424,0.9665,2.5637,4.1617,2.2665,4.3572,0.9605,0.2601,0.7717,0.7221,5.1596,4.8163,3.4467,1.9062,0.241,1.6909,3.7602,4.1748,3.8948,0.0008,0.9257,2.611,2.3627,0.2899,0.1617,3.1284,3.4253,0.1511,1.2198,5.4658,0.411,2.7688,0.0085,3.4581,0.6427,4.7326,2.1653,4.9195,5.6181,1.725,1.6357,0.8886,2.8278,5.7448,0.2685,0.7348,3.9097,1.1189,4.3246,0.1841,0.7718,6.7009,5.0301,2.7111,2.0832,3.6288,1.1509,2.1373,2.1407,1.6055,1.6902,0.267,0.6273,0.6057,5.2562,2.6026,4.527,0.1214,4.2137,2.6056,1.6165,2.1551,0.6538,4.096,1.2974,1.8202,0.8001,4.3743,0.8913,5.3318,0.6983,0.9884,4.8929,1.4953,0.3963,1.5648,6.313,1.9833,1.4641,4.9142,4.9565,4.9114,2.7022,1.0761,3.6634,2.9937,2.0958,3.6138,1.575,2.512,0.0042,0.2701,4.8909,0.2501,0.3747,0.4496,1.4552,1.6497,6.779,3.565,0.713,0.2647,1.9254,3.6134,1.3313,2.6103,1.6283,0.5802,1.5512,2.8996,5.1239,1.3979,5.3551,1.291,0.0021,0.0005,0.8244,4.1717,3.0034,0.1396,1.3511,4.2632,0.3687,1.8275,4.7745,0.4526,2.9873,0.038,2.2328,3.7911,5.8167,1.0617,1.7779,1.1149,2.7528,1.4882,4.44,3.2093,5.369,5.9037,0.6653,1.0299,1.1691,0.6662,0.0001,6.7924,0.8188,0.0005,4.8366,0.5936,0.0004,6.1439,0.3706,0.6678,0.0003,5.5105,2.2212,4.0036,6.0752,1.3616,2.6677,2.9497,0.7344,3.0801,16.2922,3.249,4.9276,1.4521,0.0005,5.0832,0.2205,0.0177,0.0707,0.0025,0.0004,0.0015,2.1984,15.033,1.8441,3.1374]}

{"id":805,"ended":true,"length":431,"text":"Liverpool controlled the opening passages of the game. Their first goalscoring chance came in the 11th minute when Alan Kennedy's 30 yard shot was saved by Real goalkeeper Agust\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez. Further chances fell into the hands of Mohamed Salah as he attempted to cut a corner just inches wide, but the forward managed to manage the ball himself.\nIt was just a matter of time before Liverpool got through the first half of a season which had started with the defeat at the beginning of the season. But things didn't change much from the day before, the Reds finally set their sights on the title with a comfortable 2-0 victory at Anfield on Boxing Day.\nHaving given Liverpool two games to prepare for their next match against Bayern Munich, the team that had earlier claimed promotion on Wednesday was hoping to bring home its sixth successive Premier League crown. The title is in his hands and it's a case of the Reds really taking a beating from the German giants.\nFor Liverpool's team in the final stages of the season that is in Liverpool's best interests. The loss would have been more than enough for the Reds but there is no denying that winning the title is a dream for them.\nThe Reds have managed to win two domestic titles in the last decade and if the team manages to clinch the Premier League title then it will prove them the title that they deserve in 2020. However, they will still need their hands on the title before it comes to fruition although this can't be ruled out.\nThe Reds remain one of the most exciting teams in the world and this could be the only time when they are given away their coveted title. The title can't be taken from them but they need it to be won by the man that makes it possible for Liverpool to qualify for the Champions League, the Golden Ball Award. They also need to win it by at least 1 point from their last game to secure the trophy.\nLiverpool fans are entitled to their own opinions about the title and the team but there is little they can do to change their mind on it. The season will remain a long way away but they still have plenty of time to do their best for Liverpool even if they do not win the title.","token_len":449,"entropy":[10.2682,1.5677,4.909,12.8898,1.0184,0.4363,1.4016,2.0319,5.0703,2.915,5.9767,7.0816,0.0068,2.3565,0.3148,1.7341,0.2752,4.0545,0.0019,0.0125,1.1995,7.0426,7.1116,2.8669,8.713,3.8539,2.0312,1.6806,2.084,0.3308,8.3051,2.6095,7.9795,1.9343,0.9865,4.638,0.0522,0.0009,0.0001,0.0,0.4511,8.8239,4.3187,4.9567,5.3886,0.5422,1.0445,0.0012,8.2952,0.3294,0.023,4.0814,2.0445,3.8363,0.3825,4.0126,3.1841,2.2929,5.4888,5.6652,3.0757,2.9797,0.5906,1.8034,6.0234,4.259,0.1059,6.7478,2.6223,1.5456,5.229,1.1096,0.7782,8.9434,0.4617,4.1394,2.4864,0.7151,0.001,0.112,0.1288,5.1461,3.4498,5.0543,2.4763,1.8628,1.111,3.5727,4.4972,6.4528,4.0363,2.8358,2.5579,1.7733,2.4727,4.1408,1.5525,3.0112,7.2733,0.0475,0.6835,0.9111,0.5043,4.5217,4.6147,3.5932,0.0007,3.5496,3.1124,3.5684,1.4707,5.8238,1.569,1.656,4.6808,2.4354,4.037,6.3126,2.9512,0.1183,0.1645,1.1466,1.8012,3.1788,0.4982,5.8054,1.9254,0.0129,0.8892,1.1844,1.713,2.5137,1.5093,5.4602,0.0085,0.3906,0.7112,5.5994,5.6925,2.7969,4.8398,3.6366,2.2799,2.6611,0.6069,2.1765,2.5458,2.0099,2.8936,4.9674,0.1071,0.722,1.8613,3.6329,4.7104,1.9266,6.4932,4.5908,5.2137,4.856,3.9388,3.131,6.6847,0.5848,4.8422,3.3986,5.6457,4.3283,2.058,2.707,0.0055,3.491,0.7999,2.5256,5.7346,3.4968,4.2783,6.9657,0.8108,2.2959,2.5598,2.0279,2.1826,6.2628,0.1144,4.4498,2.9732,5.9658,3.5079,2.4673,3.3715,3.5487,1.3572,4.8643,2.4283,0.6642,0.885,5.3285,1.9994,3.3002,5.0812,4.3107,1.0339,3.6234,2.9838,0.2419,0.2606,0.5683,6.0374,2.1932,5.8403,5.961,0.5362,1.1994,0.4666,0.5214,2.1124,6.4173,4.1345,1.6916,0.8514,3.7822,2.1363,1.2828,1.8937,1.225,0.8322,2.5261,3.7527,1.8236,1.6088,1.9954,0.6744,6.0994,1.1727,0.3856,1.5058,1.9954,4.3089,1.3774,2.5076,0.6338,1.5604,2.0484,1.8381,1.6307,4.8608,0.5049,2.2338,3.6067,5.4568,0.7529,1.0118,1.3007,0.6528,3.66,1.1658,4.808,2.4675,3.2756,5.6194,0.0821,6.9568,0.9739,3.7113,0.0033,0.3356,3.7456,1.7942,0.8468,4.5451,6.5357,2.9256,4.4731,4.2652,1.0072,1.6132,4.3368,6.5085,0.1745,4.0203,0.4902,2.7006,1.9049,3.5638,1.1123,4.24,6.8381,2.4687,0.8375,2.1936,3.4338,2.4999,4.129,0.643,2.0331,8.54,3.8706,4.8914,2.0188,0.7018,2.2839,0.0069,0.5514,0.7238,2.0404,1.7565,6.0111,2.6602,0.0554,0.1575,1.5969,2.2854,0.6123,0.2235,0.4697,0.9823,0.8399,3.471,3.0307,1.0997,1.2961,4.6362,2.1112,4.3224,0.503,2.5097,5.1264,7.0829,1.2133,6.8885,1.1245,0.6475,2.6749,3.7817,3.6436,1.8346,0.5988,2.9344,3.0913,0.4092,1.8603,2.256,3.5434,2.6344,1.344,2.2342,2.2139,3.5321,1.8719,6.1361,2.3652,4.7536,2.0556,1.5087,1.3416,2.5708,0.117,4.1656,0.1409,0.2454,0.438,0.0024,3.8673,2.433,6.9579,5.5432,10.0587,0.4416,4.5987,3.8976,0.8401,0.4709,0.851,2.3071,2.5554,6.1016,0.0088,4.3904,0.3629,3.0899,1.8853,1.7917,4.5013,3.6253,2.4391,1.021,2.443,0.6907,0.5627,2.7691,3.6102,2.3096,4.3695,0.0261,0.7876,3.4598,0.8502,2.6076,1.086,2.4193,1.9285,2.4371,2.5964,4.595,3.2606,0.6353,4.0102,4.2235,0.1421,0.2539,1.0631,1.5272,2.4091,1.1215,3.2529,3.0571,0.2936,2.277,4.6031,2.4108,5.985,2.061,2.4254,1.089,1.59,1.3634,3.1483,4.2799,0.3994,2.0994,0.9386,1.2483,0.2606,4.3791,1.5896,1.2938,3.4543,2.9807,7.3168,0.289,0.9272,2.5145,1.2073,1.2936,0.4254,0.9023,0.4391]}

{"id":1531,"ended":true,"length":437,"text":"( Note : The voice actors for the story are unknown at the moment as Zo\u00eb Mode never credited them ) The protagonist of the game, a young man named Danny, suffers from Alzheimer\u2019s. She was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis three months prior to the game being released. It will take until a year after release of the game to determine if she is an actual person. But now, she is. She is the main character in the game. So, the question is how will she deal with the death she brought to this game.\n\nThe answer to this question is by all means, play through it first. There\u2019s two things to keep in mind. First, the game will use the power of the magic in certain ways. Once you understand the way to activate your special abilities, you won\u2019t be stuck with a bad case of the disease. And second, the game will use the magic more than once to bring you into the game. All that is required is that you have a proper connection with the game.\n\nThe story also revolves around an unknown person. They are a teenager from South America, or possibly even a country of the same nationality. They have the same personality and personality type, but have different abilities. One of them has special abilities. They can read the history of many people, or they can be an artist. Then there is the other one. Here the story starts to take shape. They become the biggest characters in the game. They have their own personality and personality type. They are also the main storyline.\n\nThe story will have at least three main characters, both protagonists : a young man named Danny, the protagonist of the game. They are also the main villain and the main protagonist in the game\n\nFinally, you will also find out how this mysterious creature will be managed to live on. For a lot of people including myself, the story takes place. When the player comes across anything that they like of the story, they can choose to play it again. However, the game will need to do that first to make sure that the character character is happy and successful.\n\nThe above article was originally published on 1 June 2018 at 1:27 pm.","token_len":455,"entropy":[10.3104,1.6116,2.6928,9.7206,4.0706,2.944,1.2134,5.8692,1.24,4.3674,3.8639,1.805,0.5973,4.5503,12.9284,0.5401,10.5575,6.098,8.8638,1.5912,6.0258,3.8823,5.8348,2.0542,0.685,2.6674,2.4609,3.6541,2.0215,2.046,0.7125,6.9996,1.3368,5.9015,0.5989,4.4396,15.5604,8.156,5.6584,1.5968,5.597,3.9188,4.7663,0.2341,7.3865,0.0027,0.001,0.0003,0.0,7.881,2.3305,2.2555,0.291,0.4758,1.1944,4.7241,0.2697,0.725,4.1185,5.2311,2.6882,5.1553,4.9847,2.0916,1.7413,3.5297,3.5851,0.5069,0.3785,0.6975,4.4269,1.4884,1.1395,1.2679,4.4154,1.7645,1.2136,1.3635,6.1087,4.9647,1.643,1.844,1.1415,1.7735,2.4223,1.3374,2.4255,3.4358,0.4979,1.6999,0.5397,1.1259,1.2553,4.7405,1.4211,3.2932,4.029,0.9476,2.8387,2.8795,0.9243,3.1777,0.011,1.3458,4.8331,3.9454,5.9763,2.4431,2.5957,4.0763,2.3119,2.2318,0.27,2.5172,2.9166,1.5485,1.1498,0.3374,0.6593,5.7947,5.844,0.5795,1.6181,6.6177,3.1015,2.7763,5.3574,0.7492,3.3757,13.4476,2.5081,0.5459,5.942,2.3854,0.9919,2.8336,0.0281,0.0018,1.1462,0.7401,0.3075,1.8517,1.1897,2.6204,4.8304,1.5478,6.2913,0.2316,1.1266,6.7476,4.0089,6.7107,2.7953,0.9178,5.9446,0.7413,4.763,1.3356,5.065,3.4769,4.0298,3.4464,5.8045,1.1374,0.3964,0.7491,4.2663,1.9667,0.8077,0.1392,1.1512,5.6019,1.0699,2.2292,3.9408,6.6119,0.1843,2.5243,3.4929,0.5266,3.8265,1.0118,0.0615,1.619,1.2333,0.5139,1.6345,1.2955,2.9306,5.6811,2.0776,1.1952,2.4316,3.6329,1.7209,3.1279,1.1434,1.5682,0.5825,5.3978,3.3858,1.9796,1.1125,0.6009,2.4321,0.1248,2.2203,1.8173,6.9467,5.4279,0.7758,0.61,1.4481,1.488,1.3026,0.0003,2.0841,3.9461,4.747,3.8133,0.0049,3.7901,4.5823,2.5136,1.9098,4.5844,1.0449,2.1737,5.9923,3.0865,5.3563,1.6117,1.8093,6.1574,3.6748,3.1187,1.8017,4.0995,3.1447,2.3071,2.0599,6.1236,0.4821,1.3926,1.9094,3.5918,1.8973,4.3686,1.3862,3.4771,4.0797,1.9006,0.8935,3.2114,0.3707,3.2391,0.6543,3.6538,0.5057,1.2045,2.2983,4.3681,0.638,2.5615,3.4647,3.0898,4.0603,1.9166,5.679,0.2044,6.1747,3.656,1.3007,2.9646,1.8269,0.102,4.1293,3.5859,4.8115,0.9161,5.9936,1.8007,0.7565,1.101,3.0032,1.9945,1.1759,6.9575,3.5725,1.6507,3.3464,2.3478,2.6664,1.2579,0.5427,3.7207,4.2611,3.0828,6.4009,2.2227,0.4859,0.1975,0.2719,0.9135,1.6542,2.3434,3.4911,0.2612,3.1686,1.1811,1.5908,1.636,0.7397,1.7825,1.5159,3.0803,1.7631,1.3801,8.7988,2.0174,1.3772,0.0002,1.6265,1.9515,2.4025,3.3855,4.6137,0.1281,1.832,1.619,1.5203,1.9063,5.2645,4.6885,7.8957,4.1294,1.0594,0.8074,0.8329,0.1033,0.6495,3.3534,1.7912,0.4672,0.1376,0.2035,1.4956,3.724,1.0602,3.6304,1.1631,0.2241,5.174,3.0843,1.6999,0.518,3.0772,1.6126,0.2036,0.444,6.6644,0.0002,6.7157,0.1774,3.659,0.7693,2.8174,3.3057,1.8566,2.5011,3.7321,3.8427,5.6787,2.9762,2.6813,6.0142,4.3524,3.2914,4.1729,1.105,4.8453,2.9588,3.897,0.0428,1.0089,8.7292,1.0816,0.2219,1.6759,2.2002,4.0155,0.2159,6.0603,4.4028,1.8208,2.8443,3.9177,1.1704,9.5749,1.5507,3.7915,3.4326,5.7104,1.1768,3.0369,0.3274,0.5138,2.6939,1.7963,0.5925,2.6632,1.0937,5.0942,0.6079,3.4529,0.0406,2.3418,1.5594,1.0268,6.2573,0.5519,4.0124,2.815,3.4585,2.6058,2.3185,1.042,0.9023,1.3194,3.5416,7.3453,1.4756,3.892,1.3017,5.9607,0.4629,1.1783,0.0002,2.0142,6.8525,5.2421,2.0069,1.9996,0.5947,0.8384,6.0261,4.0437,3.6121,3.9768,3.6069,0.3006,4.5484,1.3524,1.3046]}

It was built with a stone ceiling and a double wall, and was later enlarged, and transformed into a temple. At the time of the temple reconstruction and reconstruction of the tomb of King James I, the sanctuary was almost entirely rebuilt.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Eshmun sanctuary was built with a stone floor and a double wall as its center. It was first described as being one of the six pillars leading to a tomb, which were later demolished. The top of the sanctuary was a stone ceiling and was later enlarged, the roof being redened and replaced with redenomination. The tomb was reconstructed in 1370, and the sanctuary was rebuilt in 1380. The sanctuary was rebuilt again in 1383 or 1384. The sanctuary was converted and rediscovered in the 1390s. The sanctuary was rebuilt in the 15th century. The sanctuary is protected by a protected area.\n\nIn the Middle Ages (1250\u20131400), the sanctuary was rebuilt again, although this time under a third floor. It was rebuilt in 1612 and served as an abode of Holy Cross Church (a Roman Catholic church). The sanctuary was opened in 1649.\n\nIn the 19th century, the sanctuary became a center for prayer. The sanctuary was opened again in 1850 by the King of England and the Crown Prince.\n\nThe sanctuary was opened again in 1802 and was re-opened in 1903 to host the St. Theresa's Church.\n\nThe sanctuary can be found in the grounds of the Cathedral of the Parish of Wulfenburger in Bekkering, Baku, Azerbaijan.\n\nSee also\n Eshmun\n List of monuments in Azerbaijan\n List of temples in the Baku Metropolitan area\n\nReferences\n\nBaku Metropolitan Cathedral\n\nBaku Metropolitan Cathedral","token_len":460,"entropy":[7.3359,7.1618,9.5742,11.487,2.6556,6.0789,1.1553,3.2601,1.5431,1.3838,2.6127,8.3226,5.6556,1.8146,1.4212,2.6764,6.747,1.2982,8.9431,4.1136,7.3884,1.2992,8.1598,11.1046,3.8359,5.2709,1.1594,4.4374,1.4206,3.8416,7.1256,9.216,0.0176,2.3183,2.7986,0.4846,5.2064,1.9399,0.9928,1.5625,0.1773,5.0545,4.4611,2.3589,3.6478,5.0068,4.3259,1.7654,0.0002,2.0031,2.4098,0.0118,0.0038,1.0563,0.9109,3.5801,1.2325,1.109,3.3638,0.0696,0.544,1.4696,2.0507,2.842,3.1344,5.8824,0.6017,4.0901,2.5309,2.7221,0.0692,4.5685,2.4035,2.5136,0.035,1.2719,2.6401,4.3413,2.6792,1.9331,1.1563,5.2919,1.0055,4.4607,2.8816,2.8869,0.0064,0.9367,4.7289,0.3148,1.0737,1.9054,1.0407,1.6931,3.4642,1.7976,3.8327,4.2361,1.1864,1.7926,4.9493,3.5118,2.4159,1.4809,1.4266,3.957,4.3688,3.5393,2.044,5.7319,0.3581,0.3074,4.0096,1.1709,5.4675,0.6476,1.5243,0.8366,0.8466,3.0666,3.6116,4.8861,2.6572,1.5815,0.2864,6.2467,1.6371,1.4309,3.5892,1.3508,0.5678,1.1213,3.1472,0.3648,5.8416,1.9801,4.1878,1.1751,1.1062,0.0002,4.2157,1.1915,0.8191,1.431,17.1337,0.873,0.0046,0.0014,0.6306,0.8179,1.6107,2.6602,1.0735,2.5663,3.1432,0.9845,0.881,0.4148,0.0947,5.0346,2.9005,4.5675,0.8695,1.5332,0.5174,4.6605,4.1491,1.5145,1.5073,4.3991,0.0738,0.1614,6.0,4.1397,6.8676,1.0403,2.5125,5.7156,1.5967,2.5166,4.6435,1.6211,3.9931,1.0346,1.1761,4.1982,0.759,0.0863,1.0772,0.861,3.5116,3.5492,5.4062,1.6629,3.1061,1.3023,0.794,1.1549,4.8399,4.3935,2.4272,6.8401,2.3995,1.455,2.9487,0.5192,4.6519,7.1883,4.574,1.1239,1.001,4.7949,0.8619,4.7617,1.8993,5.085,4.131,1.8899,0.7886,1.4017,3.3417,0.6646,2.1668,0.5206,1.6957,2.9193,0.4595,1.4213,2.5572,0.6823,3.0193,2.4743,0.2877,1.5894,2.9376,6.6992,0.725,1.4438,1.3873,1.271,2.4648,0.4267,4.9897,4.0998,5.825,3.1345,0.4148,2.1864,2.8784,0.8707,0.3445,0.7182,1.2743,1.91,0.501,2.1005,1.0485,1.2891,2.5669,0.6757,0.0747,1.3341,1.2233,1.5987,2.3492,6.7741,0.5555,0.9552,5.3794,3.3776,2.5108,0.9099,0.0002,3.886,1.2373,5.2726,0.0129,4.6745,3.5114,2.4302,1.649,1.5958,1.7761,0.4887,0.7885,1.688,0.2405,2.4488,4.8496,1.4465,5.6361,1.9944,0.0829,4.5757,1.5619,6.2217,2.9753,1.8444,1.9425,0.4438,1.7425,1.2076,3.4528,3.9778,1.8791,7.6288,0.2763,2.5823,3.4664,0.2018,1.256,6.7129,4.7962,2.8371,3.2412,4.0847,3.5757,0.1881,1.3519,1.8691,1.0953,0.7653,0.3301,5.6577,0.7312,1.1095,4.1628,1.8533,1.5131,0.0002,2.1242,0.2923,3.0639,0.0019,0.0927,0.2474,0.453,0.7196,3.9946,0.8408,4.6314,1.1132,4.6217,2.2348,1.2955,1.3351,0.3654,3.4176,3.5012,0.3067,5.1581,4.331,1.5043,3.2629,0.2627,1.2299,1.9876,1.9578,6.598,2.3477,3.101,1.9385,0.0002,1.2997,1.3983,0.4376,4.0027,1.7372,0.2135,1.2335,4.3853,1.7769,2.0239,4.0776,0.2924,0.8691,0.3602,3.7794,4.2185,4.7898,0.7988,4.6424,0.8361,5.968,2.1059,2.982,1.1645,1.1348,0.0002,1.0118,0.8809,6.6202,0.4112,1.6218,0.7348,1.0329,5.8344,0.2065,0.6772,3.7568,0.2993,2.6519,7.9188,0.3036,4.4983,4.5741,2.9871,4.7066,1.5453,1.5025,4.7638,6.0085,4.6644,6.4917,1.0267,3.8323,5.2531,0.8401,0.3581,0.4809,1.0146,0.0002,4.9945,0.4624,1.1338,15.9465,0.0695,0.0106,2.7869,22.2974,0.1527,6.0725,2.7182,4.6948,0.9904,21.468,0.0149,4.5767,0.3271,4.0806,4.1999,0.0648,6.3075,2.7602,0.6594,0.0004,3.3458,0.894,0.0006,2.1953,2.0799,2.3173,5.1224,1.7855,0.0003,1.5751,0.2426,1.1275,1.3547]}
{"id":2012,"ended":false,"length":439,"text":"Hurricane Brenda originated from a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on August 9 ; however, the initial wave quickly weakened upon entering the Atlantic Ocean. By August 13, Brenda was on the move between the US and Cuba. Brenda was named by historians as the first tropical cyclone of all history while a second tropical storm of Caribbean-like shape was named in honor of the island's King Charles I II. Although Brenda was named for the island itself not a named system, it is nonetheless regarded as one of the earliest Atlantic named storm systems.\n\nThe tropical-type storm winds and waves of Brenda was accompanied by gusts of up to 160 kms. per hour (150 knots) when it formed from the eastern Atlantic Ocean, hitting Cuba and the Dominican Republic. The storm peaked at speeds of 155 kms per hour (180 kms.\/hour) off Florida. The hurricane became a major hurricane after it attained the top of the western Pacific Ocean on August 13, the same day that it was named. Brenda became the first tropical cyclone to strike the area during the 19th century, marking the start of a new period where tropical disturbances were common.\n\nThe first hurricane and tropical storm in the United States was Tropical Depression Maria in 1926. There is speculation that one of Maria's major damage, that was caused by her storm surge, was caused by an unstable water level at the time. The storm made landfall at Cape Town, South Africa on September 2 and entered the Atlantic Ocean after storm surge increased above 20 feet (9 cm). This prompted the island to declare a state of emergency for the rest of the island. When the storm had a maximum sustained winds of 180 kms per hour (145 knots), it destroyed the towns and villages of Cape Town.\n\nThe hurricane made landfall on August 14 at Cape Town, South Africa with gusts of 125 kms. per hour (150 knots). On September 14, the hurricane made landfall at the mouth of the Cape of Good Hope, making landfall at 10 am (12 pm (CEST) on the island. At 5 pm (CEST), it made landfall at Saint Thomas in the same municipality which was still on the island when it made landfall during the last storm surge of the event.\n\nReferences","token_len":462,"entropy":[8.9305,9.8073,10.8872,1.357,2.1219,3.0269,7.5419,1.6929,4.5267,4.9932,0.5089,4.5961,0.4424,0.1087,4.3721,3.0805,3.3889,3.1902,13.1621,4.2856,0.1127,1.4751,6.3245,2.6973,5.8769,4.0937,8.2102,5.2394,0.5075,2.6685,0.6227,1.2544,4.301,2.4287,3.0999,0.3826,6.1589,1.1685,4.2977,1.4206,2.9965,6.6823,0.9041,5.0448,0.4614,4.1449,1.6004,4.399,1.6929,4.9415,3.1198,4.8777,0.4027,0.9342,1.6575,3.6484,1.6528,0.0085,2.8481,4.0107,9.3177,7.0229,4.1994,3.2257,2.5395,1.9397,2.7104,7.813,5.9332,2.4372,5.2092,1.3179,0.4053,3.6289,2.8322,0.0095,1.0186,2.7154,1.06,5.911,3.6712,1.7886,6.6066,0.5545,4.6562,3.4707,1.158,1.3321,2.8208,1.1828,2.0276,4.2497,7.32,4.4821,6.1006,7.0773,0.4034,0.9683,1.9444,5.7582,5.158,0.1838,1.3151,0.0356,0.1191,2.957,5.4324,9.0212,3.4256,0.3946,0.8097,1.6153,0.0326,1.7629,4.45,4.5019,3.1404,2.1631,7.6244,2.9911,3.4557,2.5238,3.0197,6.1558,4.4876,0.0294,4.7128,0.1809,0.4838,0.691,0.0031,4.7548,3.3002,7.4138,1.8402,7.6652,0.9045,1.8119,6.4289,4.1591,1.3252,4.5942,0.9195,3.5215,2.4948,1.256,3.8837,2.5733,1.5546,2.0269,5.9393,2.2839,2.0294,1.8062,1.5455,0.025,1.3537,1.161,1.9424,5.6866,0.9529,6.2747,0.1367,5.1584,0.6063,0.0126,1.006,0.0063,0.3957,3.145,2.1695,0.0098,8.9447,4.8573,0.6366,5.5188,4.1029,2.1104,1.2682,2.5007,5.2282,1.8273,2.7596,1.3835,4.0527,1.6756,7.8927,2.3988,3.919,0.4954,0.4031,4.5918,3.3769,1.626,2.1467,0.4242,2.7453,1.1148,5.1082,1.8793,0.0693,1.109,2.3157,2.0819,0.5414,1.8401,3.5202,3.5685,0.7998,1.0071,1.0473,0.9699,0.0174,1.1681,3.2776,0.673,5.7599,3.3457,0.8085,5.0173,0.041,0.106,1.4964,5.1429,0.5863,3.682,0.0212,1.3155,2.1427,3.3836,5.6913,1.5862,6.8405,1.3553,2.4491,0.6994,1.0101,0.0002,1.5595,2.8478,2.3763,5.4445,2.242,1.2362,2.8668,0.9744,2.5151,0.015,1.1571,7.3295,4.5573,6.8926,1.8435,5.1193,0.601,5.8271,4.0372,4.4102,0.1833,5.4758,0.5466,3.5149,0.048,3.1905,6.6272,4.7917,4.8102,3.6043,1.8906,0.0727,4.6705,4.6572,0.7706,0.5672,1.318,1.0645,0.0392,3.0152,5.3878,4.0478,3.367,3.2523,0.5648,1.3814,0.6803,1.6897,2.3723,4.6682,0.0207,2.7156,5.0453,3.7119,0.5028,0.3629,0.1594,1.042,2.1337,3.1922,3.1039,6.069,0.3503,1.9732,0.5078,6.0511,6.5145,0.2801,5.0667,5.3519,3.5684,2.2566,2.0639,3.2245,4.6823,0.5722,4.018,4.5811,1.0121,4.6477,0.7991,2.3852,1.0349,1.1072,0.0187,0.0685,3.4703,1.1454,3.7108,0.0004,0.4977,2.7484,0.8814,5.2387,1.0182,1.0996,4.7912,4.6162,2.8923,0.7259,1.1434,0.073,3.5118,0.4656,0.0686,0.7178,0.0057,0.1622,4.4214,0.5334,0.4896,0.8976,5.4201,2.4427,6.4383,2.1872,1.6306,1.0107,2.5348,0.1321,4.05,1.5024,0.0002,1.3337,3.2158,3.8965,0.0724,1.4147,1.7001,2.5252,2.7743,2.0496,0.5784,0.7894,0.5067,0.0186,4.2332,3.3831,0.0223,0.1228,5.0863,0.0869,0.0035,2.2328,1.1527,0.0019,0.0549,2.8028,0.0664,0.7413,4.2028,1.6721,3.5014,0.3448,1.2409,1.8889,2.5875,0.0553,1.306,2.4128,5.3672,0.0166,0.6352,1.4304,2.2912,0.0026,0.0011,1.0554,6.5432,0.2524,1.1508,5.3959,2.2001,1.6732,3.5013,1.4084,5.8863,4.8155,2.1836,1.915,1.3706,0.7769,3.3355,4.6267,3.8012,3.6571,1.0903,0.4465,0.4829,0.0062,1.5779,1.8276,1.8748,0.0602,1.1346,6.9682,4.5646,3.2013,1.2483,6.2586,6.1679,4.8117,1.6653,4.5834,3.698,0.6242,1.3773,3.5589,1.0268,0.9633,0.0184,6.5614,0.4798,4.4547,1.5598,0.7879,3.3203,1.1696,6.5811,0.2658,1.212,0.0002,6.5505]}
{"id":3979,"ended":false,"length":439,"text":"In November 1934, Butler claimed the existence of a political conspiracy by business leaders to overthrow President Roosevelt, a series of allegations that came to be known in the media as the Business' Political Plot. The conspiracy was alleged to have involved the financial exploitation of the \"Corporations of America.\" It was thought that a coup would be staged in order to topple the President and that it was believed that any such coup was likely to succeed. The Conspiracy Plot was eventually uncovered by the Special Counsel from the Bureau of Investigation (BOUI), named Richard Berman.\n\nThe Conspiracy Plot, if believed and confirmed, led to financial and financial chaos within the United States as the Financial Sector was collapsing in Europe and the United Kingdom. A series of scandals resulted in the death and destruction of private companies. The government was forced to take drastic measures to stabilize the Financial Crash, as a result of the collapse in the Standard & Poor's 200.\n\nUnder pressure from the President, in the months before and after the disaster in Europe, both the British and US administrations tried to sabotage the collapse of the UK financial system by placing pressure on the British banking system through the British Financial Crime Commission (SFCC). The scheme to defraud the Financial Centre was devised by the British Treasury and the BCA (British Financial Collity Authority). The scheme was executed in January 1939, with the help of an international gang led by German businessman Max Stein.\n\nIn April 1941, the British Financial Collity and its directors were indicted by a Belgian court. They were charged with fraud for allegedly facilitating the conspiracy, and for aiding the bank fraud. The British Financial Collity was forced to withdraw a large sums of money from the bank account of a financial professional, and the Financial Group of America (FGVA) was put under duress.\n\nThe first batch of bankers facing prosecution faced some minor legal difficulties.

The bill would impose fines for violations, penalties of up to $25,000 and a 20 year probation and\/or a $1,000 fine.\nOn March 20, 2009, Mr. Trump signed a comprehensive bipartisan legislation to amend the Controlled Substances Act that was originally proposed in 2002 and was intended to address the misuse of substances to prevent people from making drugs. The bill would require certain public health authorities, including health care providers, to ensure that the public's exposure to banned substances is not harmful or non-viral.\nMr. Trump has said drug consumption was a \"troubling thing\" during his campaign and has promised that he will make changes to the Controlled Substances Act. A series of initiatives, some of which have been stalled, have resulted in the proposed legislation being reintroduced.\nOn April 9, the House Judiciary Committee approved the bill in a 51-41 vote.\nPresident Donald Trump signed a bill that would change the Federal Drug Administration's drug monitoring system to allow drug companies and medical providers to monitor drug users. The bill passed last week, but President Trump signed an executive order to block the new regulation from going on to be implemented.\n\"As Congress and the American people work toward the common goal of reducing access to effective and necessary drug control and prevention, this legislation reflects the urgency of ensuring that access to safe and effective drugs remains a top priority,\" U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives, stated in a statement. \"The Trump Administration has shown us the power to use federal authority to protect people's health.

{"id":3525,"ended":false,"length":413,"text":"Bonnet is alleged to have been one of the few pirates to make his prisoners walk the plank. No contemporary source makes any mention of Bonnet forcing prisoners to walk the plank, and the prisoner's lack of ability to ride appears to have been a major contributing factor in the island's being overrun by pirates, while the majority of prisoners who had been freed by the pirates died in their detention centres.\n\nIn 1814, an unknown pirate named Robert Bockland attacked a merchantman named Jack O'Brien and killed him. In the later years of the 20th century piracy has steadily increased on and off the island, while it has increased steadily since the early seventies.\n\nPiracy has also had significant influence on the lives of the people in the Philippines. In 1994, as much as 500,000 people were estimated to have been murdered on the island after a \"genetic\" crime involving a \"genetic mutation\", due to piracy, which is in many cases the cause of death for indigenous populations in areas where it is common. The result is more rapes, rape, and homicide on the island that could have been avoided if these crimes were stopped or discouraged.\n\nThe government has recently set up a fund where the survivors receive the reward of \u00a3100,000 for the information where their information was collected, but which is currently not being used. People who have been convicted of murder and\/or rape have been made the subject of a bounty system in order to win back their lost souls and to obtain information on their guilty victims.\n\nIn December 2011 the government announced that it will be investing \u00a32.4 million in the National Heritage Fund (NNFM), the island's foundation, to support the reconstruction of the island. The fund will support the rehabilitation of the island's archaeological ruins, such as those of Javanese islands, so that it can be rebuilt.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nThe Lost Island.

The argument ends with Peggy'agreeing to the relationship between Abe and Peggy, who goes on to end up being the sexiest woman on the planet. However, two weeks before their wedding, Peggy's relationship is threatened by \"Abe's cheating\" on her new boyfriend. The incident makes Peggy's marriage look bad to viewers, thus, it is decided to cut the episode and make new episodes. The remaining three episodes are scheduled and are due on 5 May.\n\nProduction\nIn order to keep her storyline fresh and keep viewers informed, all of the episodes that have aired since May have begun filming. The season 11 finale to the season four first episode 'The Secret Love' was filmed in a location off of the island of Polylox during filming. The island was also used as a filming location for the pilot 'I Love You' in May 2015. In that episode, Peggy's wedding to Abe turns out to be an emotional one as he admits he has a boyfriend and, therefore, feels guilty for his actions.

{"id":2614,"ended":false,"length":446,"text":"In a manuscript he wrote in 1704 in which he describes his attempts to extract scientific information from the Bible, he estimated that the world would end no earlier than 2060. In predicting the timescale, the author concluded that it was very likely a long-term \"period of change\" of the climate, and argued that the time was \"an indefinite period of time from which an infinite variety of natural processes \u2013 including the natural world \u2013 could be formed; the world itself could be easily destroyed; the universe, if it did nothing, could be destroyed\".\n\nThis notion was rejected, but because the author of this manuscript was an anarchist, he became an anarchist as a result of his ideas. In the text he describes his views on human nature as \"an indefinite period of time\". His work attempts to estimate the rate of change of the climate at different stages of time \u2014 \"the period of change may take between three to five years\" or more, but is not measured in the actual rate.\n\nAlthough in 1704 both the British and the French governments rejected his view, the Spanish government chose to intervene in the climate with the exception of Catalonia where, using the time series of the Bible, and to the north, where it was much weaker, he attempted to calculate the rate of change of climate.\n\nHowever, he realised that as long as the climate persisted at an increasing rate, it would rise rapidly at a rate which almost all other major nations in the world could not understand. While the time of change predicted it, he predicted that when the climate reached an accelerating rate, climate change would become more visible. According to both the British government and the French government (as opposed to the authors of these two early books), the rate of change of the climate was the rate at which this global event could be seen and seen in the world. So, when the climate reached a rate of about four percent in the years 1705\u20131709, the rate of the rate of change could not be seen or see in the world.\n\nWhen the climate reached a rate of about eight percent in 1709, the rate of change could not be seen or seen. So it assumed that as long as the climate continued at the accelerating rate it would rise rapidly through history.\n\nReferences","token_len":464,"entropy":[3.4603,11.0416,4.8576,1.4241,1.5314,5.4548,5.3682,3.8762,1.6802,0.1632,2.7254,1.6607,5.6103,0.2403,6.5856,6.8214,1.1261,0.213,1.1787,3.4902,0.8704,1.853,7.833,0.2312,1.7334,4.5544,2.1354,4.2761,7.4411,2.0314,0.0117,3.4756,2.9989,0.5999,2.8429,10.4502,0.7502,5.8829,3.727,1.2919,3.45,2.9746,4.2422,0.2315,3.7057,1.3519,5.2471,0.9215,4.9848,4.516,3.232,0.9053,4.2713,5.3592,0.6023,4.1744,1.3267,2.813,1.6295,4.3377,1.6598,2.0909,5.9413,0.2152,1.5131,3.5001,2.7858,2.8415,5.7022,4.1015,1.6171,0.668,1.5726,4.3781,3.3203,4.9105,3.7446,3.3732,0.0393,4.1705,2.1562,7.6908,2.9625,1.6394,3.3544,3.1569,1.0089,1.6817,1.5362,5.1001,6.234,3.094,3.6636,4.3742,2.1759,1.2579,7.4245,3.1265,4.2632,1.698,4.1158,3.138,3.7557,0.9995,4.2811,7.8248,1.1851,1.2956,1.3954,1.3811,3.8144,0.752,0.0005,3.6243,5.661,1.7668,3.6975,3.2407,2.4835,6.4695,1.9692,3.6075,3.1976,2.5683,2.5087,1.4179,2.6405,6.458,0.5419,0.9488,4.5705,2.4793,2.6609,4.2553,2.9203,0.6725,1.2845,0.872,4.9336,0.4203,2.3115,2.3467,5.5686,1.0821,2.633,1.0858,3.7894,1.4091,4.6931,2.3865,1.6832,1.7785,2.704,5.3231,0.4323,0.106,0.7333,3.3737,3.5849,4.4342,7.2495,0.0464,5.3318,0.4627,4.1923,0.34,0.7331,0.8997,0.1997,1.2524,4.3047,3.4757,3.7519,0.5721,2.0644,7.7107,4.014,1.819,2.7035,0.4491,1.3829,6.3469,4.3676,4.6536,3.3825,1.7628,1.731,1.3843,2.7006,3.5304,3.598,1.7135,2.673,3.8736,1.9419,5.9335,1.0326,3.0888,4.8061,4.4714,2.6812,1.7613,0.0001,4.6691,4.8093,2.4949,0.961,7.7885,1.7102,3.6776,0.6231,2.0505,1.0423,2.008,3.8635,1.4472,3.9842,0.7985,1.7352,5.8226,1.0919,4.9763,0.5678,4.516,1.3346,1.3539,4.023,5.6391,1.5002,5.5589,0.0199,6.1566,4.8225,3.2258,7.024,1.2139,5.7408,6.5191,1.6306,0.7715,3.6898,0.4023,5.9221,4.333,2.996,7.1517,1.9367,4.122,2.4903,0.922,6.0038,6.0422,1.067,2.7455,5.0156,0.0511,3.2268,0.3669,1.0654,0.1872,0.3665,0.7891,4.164,1.1328,1.7094,0.0001,4.5577,0.0926,2.2897,5.6848,0.2343,5.2008,2.607,0.0123,1.0782,2.8118,5.3134,3.5041,3.7115,4.2947,0.0544,0.6461,1.7143,0.719,6.8671,2.7044,4.6359,1.4334,2.5755,2.8204,7.5512,4.416,2.2627,6.0883,2.9183,2.6793,0.3133,0.2604,1.4999,0.4368,4.7301,0.4722,6.2374,1.849,3.9971,2.3587,2.2104,6.9069,6.7233,0.6481,1.5686,4.0947,0.4531,5.0113,0.8931,1.8101,3.1598,2.5742,5.7317,0.4011,0.7978,5.4808,0.7133,0.2222,3.1178,2.0301,4.9171,1.2629,5.3842,0.0039,7.3129,1.6098,2.7057,2.8975,0.1203,0.3407,0.4229,0.8887,4.943,3.462,3.8915,0.0026,0.8311,5.0603,0.6303,4.0921,1.9027,6.5431,3.1983,0.4148,1.0756,2.1468,0.0829,0.3213,0.8604,0.3435,0.4385,1.2545,3.6472,3.4312,0.9827,0.0024,6.0201,5.2254,3.9496,2.8397,0.7988,2.6631,2.6901,4.214,2.7545,0.8529,2.8038,0.6484,5.484,1.3589,3.5004,0.7389,1.7498,1.756,1.2404,1.303,0.9389,2.1211,4.6777,4.5982,3.2927,0.9763,4.5687,0.3685,3.0061,3.3633,0.4411,3.0446,0.2419,1.2744,1.6719,0.2306,3.8493,2.5326,0.0583,0.7946,4.2057,2.1463,0.2911,1.9656,3.3908,6.7333,2.0541,0.373,0.2857,0.7624,0.5122,0.0001,4.2258,0.7914,1.7212,1.0657,1.121,0.2907,0.0609,0.796,3.4538,0.1457,0.2443,1.2769,1.7584,0.3758,0.7271,0.4155,0.0366,0.9278,1.2529,0.1477,0.0322,0.0364,0.7307,0.7838,4.4478,4.4484,3.8367,8.1842,0.316,4.5707,0.8241,0.003,0.3631,0.7467,0.7047,1.018,3.0473,3.069,0.0583,2.3198,0.2396,1.4375,0.7514,6.9595,4.9234,0.6952,1.1079,0.0001,6.8526]}

{"id":2910,"ended":false,"length":418,"text":"Caras Park is located just south of the historic Wilma Theatre downtown. It is located on land reclaimed when the Higgins Avenue Bridge was widened from two lanes to four in 1962. Before the Bridge replacement, the historic center itself was an underground area of a three-story, seven-story building that was later expanded into a two-story, nine-story, 21-story building dating back to the year 1846. During World War II, the center was transformed into a military museum dedicated to the Battle of St. Paul and the Second Strain. During these wartime years, the Center was also named for the German Army during World War II. On October 3, 1945, the Center's original building was dismantled after it was demolished.\n\nThe City of Wilma was one of only seven cities in the United States to be designated a Historic Preservation Preservation Area (HPA), an umbrella term that enables a city to make improvements to its buildings to prevent them from deteriorating or being destroyed during the restoration process. Wilma was also one of only eight towns in all 50 states to be designated a Historic Landmark Preservation Area (HPA), a historic marker for a city that has only one historical marker. The Wilma Heritage Project is a statewide collaborative, inter-governmental project that is part of the State of New Jersey Project, a partnership of the Center for Public Policy Research (CPR) and the Council for New Jersey at New York University.\n\nWilma is known as being a major home to the oldest of the many museums on the West side of Newark. The Wilma Museum and Library opened in 1937. The museum serves as both a home and a school for the children of Newark's residents.\n\nWilma has a reputation as the home of the University of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania University was founded in 1826 as a first-division university of Pennsylvania with some of the most extensive university education in the state including the first academic library. Its largest campus is located inside the Wilma Department of Industrial Engineering.\n\nWilma was named for Sir Wilma de Sisto, a general who served as Chancellor from 1775 to 1785. On November 10, 1675, the town was incorporated as a city, with the purpose of providing housing, schools and recreation.\n\nReferences","token_len":464,"entropy":[6.6645,8.6873,3.3348,3.0468,2.6233,2.3639,0.0054,1.4571,5.5078,7.4581,3.8514,6.8674,6.332,0.5769,2.3399,1.4162,2.7064,1.6777,7.5451,5.0048,6.9858,0.6928,10.6183,5.2702,1.5311,0.47,5.5891,4.7427,5.5189,0.5768,0.5977,1.7903,2.3977,4.0469,0.3741,7.1808,1.0448,3.6273,7.7568,0.7069,1.1032,4.9098,4.9894,7.5066,0.5626,4.3071,5.9124,5.6275,2.2921,2.4787,5.3687,0.3876,0.4718,3.0257,4.486,0.1315,0.7256,0.8057,1.9544,1.1484,4.374,4.5343,1.4446,0.7293,3.3127,0.0424,0.0666,1.3539,3.5339,0.0111,0.0021,3.2599,6.185,0.3433,0.0708,0.7284,7.6046,1.0488,0.1196,1.3085,6.1313,2.3718,4.2971,0.1401,4.8942,2.0765,0.005,0.1846,0.1836,0.7523,3.7093,0.734,3.6699,0.1595,0.6314,4.6996,2.6996,4.5911,0.0552,0.9217,3.5215,0.0173,4.8199,3.0358,3.153,2.3708,1.1558,3.9358,5.6644,5.7012,1.0543,3.9842,6.1701,3.4237,0.34,0.1127,0.7712,3.8331,1.0086,2.716,4.726,1.3994,1.2256,5.0234,4.4044,4.943,0.6481,0.0022,0.1175,0.4937,5.2927,3.2267,3.3985,0.0926,2.2725,0.0674,0.8901,2.7057,2.9554,3.8749,3.1266,0.4447,4.6483,3.6387,2.6975,0.5714,2.3151,1.6708,1.6229,0.0025,1.5228,5.5589,0.3866,3.0919,0.0299,2.8262,4.0429,0.0172,3.0699,3.6411,2.73,0.6552,0.468,1.42,0.0162,0.6142,3.4135,3.3564,1.2802,3.3546,3.1043,7.1422,0.8987,1.4094,0.2838,0.3083,2.0247,4.0276,5.4332,0.1803,0.9908,6.6127,3.088,0.9508,0.3202,5.0975,3.1202,0.3506,1.4768,2.7724,2.7378,3.3631,3.0147,0.0832,2.8296,1.5928,1.9112,3.4122,3.9657,1.684,4.6875,0.1948,0.0941,3.5708,0.0046,1.6619,1.9559,0.955,0.0013,0.2366,3.4049,5.1168,0.9717,6.5099,2.3795,0.2144,0.5723,2.0442,0.4358,0.9748,0.9918,2.6162,0.1116,3.821,0.2942,0.4351,0.1953,3.3262,1.7256,2.5271,6.0204,3.4108,2.0678,2.3413,1.6777,2.0081,1.6546,5.9003,1.7634,3.9206,3.5998,1.1886,1.9309,2.0099,0.0069,4.738,5.6115,2.0588,1.2939,3.7773,3.9318,6.4439,4.3197,3.0385,2.6035,2.3625,1.3625,2.6966,4.8421,0.0277,0.3591,5.0442,0.8237,3.1823,1.8818,6.8094,2.4422,1.6693,2.5355,1.9166,0.9856,4.8073,0.2498,2.8973,2.8103,2.6271,1.9609,1.2433,0.1454,1.0746,0.3396,0.3889,5.9097,1.546,3.423,0.194,3.9092,4.3014,2.1828,0.3003,0.5536,1.2499,0.0002,2.8883,0.0094,1.5876,4.1413,1.7217,5.8002,1.7768,3.7336,6.85,1.4853,1.2043,5.6182,4.2124,0.6698,4.8961,5.6883,3.532,0.5483,2.9233,5.3032,0.0608,4.4025,0.9176,1.273,1.9732,0.0218,1.1094,2.9536,1.9393,4.27,0.3424,4.222,1.6221,0.9741,2.3192,4.7642,0.3937,4.3816,0.5166,3.9857,1.2525,1.4159,5.4889,1.058,1.4798,2.9892,0.4247,2.6,1.2932,3.4931,0.5136,2.4007,0.0002,2.4026,0.0164,2.7775,1.8078,3.4238,1.5693,2.7856,1.733,0.2026,1.0846,5.0556,0.1045,3.6798,2.0443,7.0981,4.2443,2.5933,0.9231,0.3908,0.6097,4.9048,2.2779,0.7884,6.2306,0.7581,6.7945,1.27,3.1133,1.6068,3.6054,5.4324,1.9424,0.0963,1.9473,4.1852,5.8317,3.1933,0.4146,0.0866,2.7917,6.0097,1.2761,4.2773,5.3766,4.9491,3.7188,4.4703,5.117,2.1972,0.9477,1.463,5.8114,0.5991,2.7505,0.0368,7.3897,0.0819,7.2595,1.1401,1.477,1.6865,0.0002,1.3893,0.0096,2.1229,1.9272,2.4309,6.0994,3.9012,1.4085,5.3228,4.8173,4.6909,2.5352,0.6161,1.5829,6.5472,1.1168,2.1699,0.6258,4.6561,3.8816,1.695,3.9231,0.6497,0.6604,3.0212,0.4983,5.2783,3.1279,3.5526,0.0154,3.5783,3.4688,0.2074,1.7086,5.1233,2.1193,3.3052,1.3185,1.182,2.9196,2.6001,2.9745,1.0741,6.4447,0.0545,3.8104,4.6785,2.6406,2.735,1.0657,3.1092,1.9773,1.708,0.0002,7.8335]}

This gave the College a four @ - @ year curriculum and the power to grant master's degrees - not on the request of the Governor.\n\nThe Reorganization Act of 1861 amended the Articles of Confederation, abolishing the institution of an elected legislature, allowing states the power to declare war \"except when there are circumstances which give an urgent need; when the power is not exercised otherwise; when the state exercises, if it chooses, the power to declare war \"unless under the jurisdiction of the Governor, and under the direction of a Secretary of State who is not only a minister of the government of the State by law but also must act in good faith; and when it was intended to enable the State to recover from its enemies the power of declaring war, there was no provision to do so.\" The Reorganization Act of 1861 also \"set aside the powers of the High Commissioners for the granting of degrees of study in the service of public use, which may, in addition to being conferred upon such officers as may be given by the law, be given freely to all or part of the people of the same state, but in accordance with the law.\" Thus, in February 1861, President Henry Williams asked the U. S. Supreme Court for a \"bio-council\" that would regulate the issuance of degrees of study.\n\nIn 1862, President Johnson appointed Governor Arthur M. Williams as acting Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky and set forth his plan for opening college districts of the Commonwealth in 1874. The plan was adopted at the first meeting of the U. S. Supreme Court by the Chief Justice of Kentucky in 1861. Under the Reorganization Act of 1861, the U. S. Supreme Court approved constitutional amendments for Kentucky. The Supreme Court subsequently passed a resolution to approve the constitutionality of the Reorganization Act of 1861, and the Constitution of the United States was made.\n\nThe Reorganization Act of 1861 also gave the U. S. State Congress the power to issue degrees of study in the service of public purposes; however, \"nothing in the Reorganization Act authorized the State of Kentucky to administer the degrees of study to graduates of public service.\"\n\nReferences","token_len":464,"entropy":[11.8281,0.3421,8.6933,4.4651,8.3513,8.2128,1.564,2.6102,6.0432,5.108,0.6178,7.7693,2.0894,0.0445,0.1684,0.9675,2.5422,0.848,4.5896,5.4244,1.4073,9.7985,2.1153,8.3696,16.7343,6.2628,6.6091,5.6308,8.0276,2.1366,3.5481,2.6312,0.0386,5.2603,7.227,0.0815,0.2051,6.9444,4.17,7.1378,1.161,7.4782,0.024,1.2286,4.0639,0.6899,1.5574,0.017,2.1322,3.7054,0.0106,0.0201,0.0194,1.2647,0.3465,6.8348,0.3997,6.9587,0.2413,0.2299,2.1919,5.0945,0.0109,0.4471,4.5669,0.1203,4.3471,4.919,2.505,1.2254,4.3219,3.3211,3.2468,0.9025,0.0864,4.8821,2.4285,7.7207,4.6984,3.7431,3.9618,2.9272,3.6007,2.9153,4.9952,4.4109,7.5468,1.4899,5.7023,4.3948,1.7785,3.6361,1.5307,2.6601,3.7272,6.6857,3.4987,1.5229,1.064,3.6286,6.255,4.4046,5.9405,1.4128,3.5906,0.3357,1.0604,1.0092,1.5797,1.1066,0.1988,6.7548,2.8575,5.3536,1.4009,3.861,0.0931,0.9499,4.184,2.0246,1.9374,3.2611,0.6394,2.8011,0.3272,1.8774,5.0818,0.34,1.0296,3.7505,1.5256,2.3801,6.5574,3.0131,5.0718,0.7087,1.2853,2.9991,2.0692,0.4263,1.952,6.0985,1.5861,1.1994,1.197,7.3565,2.5124,1.5158,3.7613,0.0125,3.7661,0.6497,0.7878,2.9865,5.7721,4.9402,0.8338,5.2673,0.7161,2.7538,0.5034,6.1158,1.9869,2.6253,2.5512,1.3788,4.5265,1.3727,0.8165,0.0905,1.7718,5.5394,0.8044,0.9781,3.2571,2.3962,2.6322,0.1281,1.1524,2.496,2.8874,0.0034,0.0078,0.0107,1.3241,0.1995,1.6627,6.0608,5.4185,3.665,0.9867,2.5927,0.7103,0.7764,6.954,3.5585,3.0354,1.0621,9.0504,0.2105,2.167,2.4156,3.9602,2.4037,0.9676,5.9932,0.0599,3.867,7.1772,1.3509,3.2776,3.7912,3.0363,1.7509,5.0573,0.4726,4.1711,2.8253,1.0504,4.5432,2.7061,0.6883,1.6064,0.6533,5.8832,2.4761,1.6403,4.2285,0.7616,0.4549,3.5787,6.8515,1.0255,2.4376,5.8485,2.4141,0.271,0.2997,3.3218,1.0354,0.2769,5.7156,2.3398,1.363,4.2334,3.2302,5.0801,0.0066,0.4029,3.1155,1.4702,4.7764,0.4388,2.4742,6.3364,1.5066,0.1665,3.8997,6.402,8.1379,5.5938,1.1938,4.2745,0.004,2.7672,0.011,2.1536,0.0057,2.71,1.396,3.831,6.0512,4.1583,0.5312,4.4708,2.4373,0.3737,0.8453,3.6572,0.4098,5.2888,0.7789,5.6304,0.1273,0.8438,1.105,0.2028,1.3716,1.5698,0.0004,1.9744,3.739,0.173,2.2753,4.061,2.625,5.8261,6.6787,3.7581,0.2019,3.2016,1.486,2.3884,6.4951,0.0729,1.0547,3.6222,2.4878,5.6322,2.5834,1.4665,1.5976,0.5647,7.5915,4.7713,7.6316,4.6785,1.3564,4.6945,3.2741,2.386,6.3742,0.2747,1.8775,2.1788,1.3226,3.801,4.1224,0.5877,3.7298,1.2506,0.0775,0.1314,4.2094,0.001,0.0196,0.0111,3.315,0.0104,4.8273,1.8369,5.1344,0.0114,1.8182,4.0228,2.7542,5.1109,0.5309,4.1837,0.7909,5.6406,0.0049,0.0061,0.0083,0.6057,0.2341,0.098,1.2254,4.0054,0.0007,0.0127,0.0017,0.465,0.0026,4.5138,9.0554,0.4596,4.1487,5.0038,2.8075,1.5295,3.1192,0.0017,5.0146,4.3589,1.146,1.4449,2.996,4.9556,0.6132,3.2247,0.1742,0.0138,0.378,1.563,0.0027,0.008,0.0074,0.3276,0.045,1.8943,2.2433,1.555,3.4043,1.5373,0.5361,0.7356,0.003,0.9626,5.4501,3.7284,0.7126,0.0002,1.5756,1.5913,0.003,0.008,0.014,0.1471,0.1307,2.7773,3.1212,0.575,3.2519,0.0006,0.0122,0.0009,6.2692,4.8157,0.9286,0.2441,0.1026,3.9852,2.706,0.1587,0.1798,1.5325,0.941,0.6798,0.0034,0.6736,5.7542,4.8586,2.8063,0.0155,4.7911,5.4396,0.6395,0.5999,2.9928,0.0025,0.0077,0.018,5.2108,0.6419,1.7631,3.4172,0.4619,0.178,5.9503,1.8282,3.4642,0.2837,0.1766,4.0653,7.645,0.5027,2.5986,4.9137,1.9568,1.309,0.0002,7.3912]}
{"id":955,"ended":false,"length":416,"text":"During 2004, Federer won three Grand Slam singles titles for the first time in his career and became the first person to do so since Mats Wilander in 1988. His first major hardcourt title came on the ATP finals stage of Wimbledon in a tie breaker against Nadal, the world number one, in the second set of their match. Federer outdueled Nadal in the semi-finals of Roland Garros for an impressive 12th Grand Slam title. The US Open final loss to Federer, one of the best players in the sport, was a major loss and a major setback to the global sporting and fitness of the French tennis player.\n\nWorld number 22 Roger Federer had said before the French tournament that the French Championships had the potential to replace men's tennis as the top sport in the world. \"I thought you were wrong,\" Federer told a news conference in Paris before the French Open. \"The French have a more unique advantage compared to many other European countries, and that is why in 2002, it was French tennis that won all 13 titles in the world cup\". Federer went on to win the tournament in all matches and, as such, only won the second grand slam title for the first time in his career.\n\nFederer had not reached the semifinals of the Roland Garros since 2008. He reached as high as No. 22 in the world after winning three final matches before the final, although this was followed by a one-year hiatus and missed the last two grand slam finals due to injury. He has five Grand Slam titles to his name and is ranked third on the all-time list at No. 25, behind only the American Roger Fedor.

Six B @ - @ 29s visually attacked targets at Yokkaichi, one at the Hanoi University of Technology, another at the Nippon Professional Engineering Laboratory, two at the Hanoi Museum of Art, and three at the Hanoi Palace of Sportsmanship.\n\nIn 1883, an attack on the Hanoi University of Technology resulted in loss of lives. A second attack on April 8, 1912 ended with the death of 1 and a half staff members and four of their children. The first attack took place at 3 pm on 22 May 1912 and resulted in the fall of the university's campus.

They aren't available for the US and I've never gotten a chance to try them...so how will I know?\nSo the way you'll know is that the game will be out in Japan and only a handful of US users have been to them.   Or you can just be a bit more generous and suggest we try to let a few people out first.\nI'd be happy to let someone else get to the game because I can do that, though I really really would like all 3. That said, I would be very interested in knowing who the other people are who haven't yet had time to try them, as I don't have time to wait for them, but I have a few friends who will be happy to try them, so maybe I'll drop them in a PM...\nIt won't let me out. If it didn't, then maybe there's a third person that might have a chance to play them after your reply. Then I'd be happy to let you out. You said that you don't own a 3DS yet so that might change (like me)\nThat was the first time I looked into it. I'll look into it, and if that doesn't work out, then I'll have to keep that in mind.\nOk so it will be out on the west from September. If that sounds good, can you let me know how you're done with the game?\nThank you so much! I'm glad you're happy, I'm just starting my second game, and my wife is playing so its not even something she really likes to play.\nAll right, great! Thanks!\nWelcome to the club!!

{"id":1582,"ended":false,"length":425,"text":"Tropical Storm Aka was the only tropical storm to form in the Central North Pacific during 1990. An area of disturbed weather began to organize on August 6. By August 7, the storm was centered on the north-east corner of the Pacific basin and was about 1,100 miles (1,530 kilometers) southeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico. The storm's arrival was accompanied by \"frequent tropical rain\" on August 9 and 12. The storm recorded a loss of 8.6 miles (13.6 kilometers) from the Atlantic coast and increased its intensity as it traveled to the south\u2013 and southeast\u2013 of Puerto Rico. That system became a hurricane on August 13.\n\nOn August 16, the storm formed above the eastern tip of San Juan and was located 740 miles (800 kilometers) east of San Juan, Puerto Rico. An area of tropical storm conditions was spotted in southeastern parts of San Juan and remained so until August 18. On August 18, Aka was reported by U.S. Geological Survey as having a maximum sustained winds south of 120 miles per hour. She was moving west-northwest at 5 mph (10 km\/h or 8 km\/h) and increasing and slowing to a low perch on Thursday night. It grew stronger as it reached the north-east coast. A couple of hours later, as it moved more generally north, an area of tropical storm activity came to a halt, although the storm grew stronger as it passed. The storm's maximum sustained winds peaked at 185 miles (315 kilometers) per hour on August 19.\n\nOn August 24, Aka had maximum sustained winds at 60 miles (80 kilometers) per hour. It passed the southeastern tip of San Juan and was traveling northeast of San Juan and the central peninsula. As it left San Juan, it received a tropical storm alert, while it remained east of San Juan. The storm generated a strong stormforce intensity of 40 mph (70 kph) and a maximum sustained wind rate of 21 mph (29 kph), which was high enough to give rise to a tropical storm warning. At any one time, an area of tropical storm activity was possible in the central peninsula areas of San Juan, San Juan, and the central coast.

{"id":2424,"ended":false,"length":431,"text":"The need for an official state flag arose in 1904 when the West Virginia State Commission to the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis reported that the state required a flag or ensign to represent the United States on the Union flag. On March 11, 1900, the commission authorized the state to change its motto, \"Red Army\" to \"Citizen Flag-Red, Green Flag.\" The flag was painted as a symbol of the Confederate Union and the Confederate state flag was worn as a symbol of American unity.\n\nIn 1918, the commission approved the resolution to change its name into \"Red Army\" to \"Citizen Flag-Green Flag.\"\n\nIn October 1914, the Civil War was over and the United States was declared declared national independence by the Congress in Philadelphia and the state of Louisiana as its state capitol. After the defeat of the French at the Battle of Gettysburg in November 1918, many states joined the War of the Atlantic Campaign that commenced in June 1919 in the states of Virginia, and Louisiana and Texas. At this time, the American flag was a national color of the Confederate Army and the Confederate insignias included the red star and flag of the British Empire. A series of flag-gazing competitions took place throughout the year in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Ohio. The flag was flown at the Alabama State Fair in Montgomery in February 1927. The state flag would be flown at every state fair in July, although the United States flag was flown more often than the state flag at other states of the federation.\n\nThe Confederate flag also became of greater importance in the 1940s. The Confederate flag at the White House hosted the 1941 Black Panther party in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn early 1960, the United States Army National Guard organized a major parade at the Gettysburg National Park on August 6, 1961. President George H.W. Bush's administration later renamed the Park.\n\nFrom April 1962 to January 1964, the Confederate Flag was flown in the State of Alabama on January 25 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Reconstruction.

{"id":4889,"ended":false,"length":413,"text":"As a large open space close to the City, Smithfield was a popular place for public gatherings. In 1374 Edward III held a seven @ - @ day tournament at Smithfield, for young people to play in the city. On 23 November he hosted a round of \"The Dukes of Marlborough, 1st Duke of Waverley\". The tournament, the largest in England since the First World War, involved 200 players.\n\nIn the UK the Dukes of Marlborough hosted a \"Prairie\" competition, in which one set of 20 players selected by a British National Team and five UK players was awarded 3,000 Gold, Silver, and Bronze.\n\nOn 14 June 1676 Edward III declared himself a King, and in 1688 was a General of the British Army. This was a great success for the King as he was able to provide for his family with health care while he was out of service due to illness, and his army was much larger than the British Army.\n\nDuring this period of British rule in England Edward III did not win any battles but his name was given to the Duke of Marlborough by British monarch Victoria III. The date of the Duke's victory in 1689 was on 7 June 1694\n\nThroughout this period the Duke of Marlborough, Duke of Waverley and Countess of Suffolk (12 May 1678 \u2013 11 December 1698) were involved in almost all battles, either in the East of England, as members of the Duke's household, or in the War of the Roses.\n\nDespite Edward III's failure to win a combat battle, both Duke-level and Prince-level (as opposed to the Duchess-level in other countries), he continued to do well and his reputation in Britain grew. His popularity in France had also grown. His ability to take revenge against the French during the War of 1812 created a precedent for other Duke levels. This was especially the case against the Earl of Suffolk, of whom Edward III was the first to be killed in action. Edward III was well received by the French and his wife Elizabeth married Henry VIII in 1695.\n\nIn 1696Edward III was granted diplomatic immunity. He died at the age of 95 on 14 April 1698.\n\nReferences","token_len":465,"entropy":[3.2258,7.1675,7.3763,3.1395,8.4363,0.2048,0.87,6.5345,1.9988,8.8356,4.2643,3.0847,2.1604,2.3142,2.0857,1.0093,5.7645,2.4298,1.1683,3.1485,7.2201,4.5044,7.775,3.6222,5.7865,0.7173,9.75,15.7946,7.3677,5.1004,5.2688,6.2864,2.2201,1.1353,0.0111,1.8106,5.0659,8.2222,2.0358,1.2734,2.3072,2.6441,1.5062,3.278,1.107,4.3009,5.7039,3.3053,4.6977,3.521,1.0121,4.7429,0.7388,5.1072,3.6574,6.5507,1.4977,0.3641,5.1013,0.6908,0.0344,3.1358,6.1023,1.053,3.8729,0.4915,5.0459,3.1885,0.1149,4.1907,1.9481,1.997,3.0281,4.6644,3.1336,1.1731,1.3389,3.0967,1.0093,4.7159,0.572,0.0018,0.0943,3.7909,5.3504,2.4973,1.7511,2.1024,0.0253,2.564,2.1554,6.5619,2.6191,4.4851,0.0253,0.3959,0.1843,0.003,0.0061,4.1909,1.6279,4.2685,5.2274,4.2146,1.0423,4.4843,2.963,1.7549,2.6478,0.109,4.2025,6.3174,0.6349,5.5778,1.3177,5.5578,2.0098,1.882,6.0538,5.7699,3.057,4.3777,4.5943,9.0228,1.9503,4.5627,2.6232,6.7025,1.3408,0.3898,6.869,2.6682,3.454,1.2495,0.4605,0.8155,2.7626,2.1966,0.0002,3.7395,3.5858,2.7809,2.914,4.1651,3.5357,0.9627,4.3976,2.7597,3.8466,1.7842,2.2405,1.7263,3.1124,2.1995,3.0786,5.013,5.7378,6.2645,2.0989,0.4117,2.1011,1.3613,0.7109,4.0964,1.769,2.5362,4.0112,1.997,1.0236,0.8617,2.5118,3.2475,0.7195,2.1569,1.9487,0.0096,5.2174,1.9396,0.8482,1.4759,3.4493,5.9015,1.0462,3.6843,1.6771,0.6822,4.9871,0.5502,3.1708,5.9267,0.0095,1.2999,2.721,1.4403,3.2562,3.8664,1.2697,5.0595,2.761,0.6057,1.8029,2.958,1.0188,0.8703,0.9749,0.0002,3.5997,2.4829,0.7822,2.2708,3.2133,0.8105,2.53,1.1927,5.6506,0.7611,4.8922,0.5859,5.2353,1.88,3.5851,3.2793,3.0627,4.7299,0.6626,3.5962,0.2843,1.356,4.6925,0.1271,1.0516,0.0042,0.0104,3.4809,5.9474,4.2737,4.3998,5.7426,0.8282,2.2018,5.7057,0.6077,1.1928,3.2785,0.2895,3.0821,1.9851,0.631,2.9747,1.0804,4.6926,4.1595,2.0064,0.457,3.5567,6.8426,0.0002,6.3452,2.0201,0.215,1.949,2.3412,0.5102,0.0188,0.0011,0.0017,3.9753,3.6638,0.0539,2.1115,0.0575,0.0315,1.3816,4.6611,1.349,0.5116,4.0973,4.0547,6.7636,4.4946,0.4038,3.9383,1.7259,3.4455,2.4865,0.0958,3.1761,0.1886,0.9978,4.607,0.081,5.1185,1.274,3.1582,2.5518,5.7892,1.8169,1.4486,5.5626,4.5068,0.1015,2.1116,4.8211,6.7396,0.0304,0.2833,3.401,0.8187,2.9661,1.0011,0.1218,0.8705,1.0612,5.0137,0.3025,0.8306,0.639,0.6577,0.8147,0.0002,5.7175,3.8294,0.9455,0.2119,4.8565,0.342,0.4993,1.856,6.5383,1.4056,1.1641,4.7782,3.5114,7.0914,4.6281,1.1768,3.6911,0.3706,0.0576,4.9662,4.4451,3.2461,0.0017,2.0918,7.0649,4.263,0.5429,4.9009,4.6622,1.8181,1.3571,1.7443,3.8083,0.2252,5.1723,2.5998,3.3623,3.816,3.8622,3.5994,2.3314,3.0195,1.06,3.1659,3.5249,2.3445,4.8519,5.0639,2.9818,2.124,2.3769,3.2288,5.9853,0.0786,4.4814,6.0547,2.6611,1.3236,1.8592,3.9676,0.2536,2.6432,0.0199,3.7858,0.0308,6.0018,0.9172,5.4573,0.4314,2.185,5.6237,5.8237,1.9107,4.1661,1.7457,3.2375,2.8439,0.0622,5.4416,1.105,3.9147,0.0613,3.6085,1.1132,6.2596,1.1123,1.2605,0.3663,0.8854,1.8316,1.7302,1.6165,2.5153,2.7536,1.5056,2.0613,0.7368,3.3653,0.6021,1.5029,5.0781,3.2703,1.0037,1.0663,1.4506,1.444,2.6269,4.8256,3.4472,4.5493,4.1886,1.1532,2.0586,0.9109,4.138,0.5679,0.8566,0.0002,1.9644,0.9016,2.0235,8.503,0.2708,1.6975,3.9281,6.3265,0.687,3.4429,1.3937,5.0684,2.4109,1.0197,0.3707,0.0076,4.7266,1.8048,3.1308,2.4843,0.5385,1.0306,0.8025,1.1629,0.0002,4.6958]}

{"id":4419,"ended":false,"length":400,"text":"The rumored Ho @ - @ Chunk attack on Fort Crawford never came, and so in October 1826, Colonel Snelling moved the garrison to Fort Snelling, where he hoped to reduce hostilities by the end of the year. The garrison was attacked by a group of men in the company of Colonel O'Sullivan, who later made two attempts to cut the garrison out, and died in an assault of his own. The attack on Fort Crawford did not go down well with the General's Army. In October 1826, Colonel Snelling was placed in charge of Fort Crawford, under the command of Lieutenant General James Wilson.\n\nIn late November 1827, Captain Quarmby's death also gave the General an opportunity to form an army to support General Snelling in his effort to defeat General Snelling. With Governor Shumway's blessing Captain Quarmby was captured by a contingent of Chinese soldiers with their chief being the General himself. On 19 May 1828 Captain Quarmby was captured and held by several Chinese in the North-west of the province.\n\nIn October 1829, General Snelling was killed by a Chinese with the exception of Colonel Ephraim Aitken of the same division. Colonel Snelling was ordered to receive the reward of a medal for his actions against Colonel Aitken. The General went home with his wife and four children. A tribute of 2,300 British pounds was paid at Fort Crawford on the 29th December that year.\n\nLieutenant General R.B. Snelling was married to Colonel Thomas Merton Snelling on 21 July 1829. The two enjoyed a joint life of high nobility-level affairs between 1829 and the next year. The General went into exile at Fort Crawford the next year and was later captured in a skirmish with the Chinese forces on 22 September 1829.\n\nOn 14 January 1832, Colonel Snelling was captured by the Chinese on the Island of Hong Kong and executed, but the Chinese forced Snelling of captivity on 15 February 1832. Captain Snelling was a commander in the British Army and was then stationed at Fort Crawford. Snelling surrendered on 29 January 1834 in the same garrison which was still garrisoned. He died at the age of 69 on 14 February 1836.\n\nReferences","token_len":466,"entropy":[11.2683,11.0322,10.531,6.6559,4.69,7.9616,5.2003,9.0724,2.9392,8.3597,10.7162,9.2825,3.3405,2.882,2.4578,4.9704,5.7968,5.9458,6.4014,5.1063,1.127,6.2371,8.3064,3.0774,5.6267,2.3588,3.9994,0.9467,0.9192,6.2688,0.0018,0.9973,2.6459,0.8697,6.1214,0.2866,6.9259,5.1389,2.6213,3.9799,1.6652,0.017,0.5553,0.7697,0.2318,2.1558,2.1209,1.3797,4.2085,0.924,1.6433,2.3223,0.0416,4.2416,3.191,1.3654,4.1149,0.0502,2.8138,5.1681,0.3448,3.5666,0.8898,1.2114,5.829,4.5692,5.4906,3.5771,0.3912,5.241,1.7988,1.8893,3.9217,2.2065,1.9927,4.4914,1.3394,4.0017,5.2971,2.8428,3.7993,0.2265,0.497,1.8763,3.1334,1.906,0.1098,1.3965,4.5117,0.2066,2.716,2.3623,0.3255,0.5596,0.4823,5.3135,1.9169,4.0874,1.3404,2.912,2.7374,0.6277,1.6439,0.3523,2.8194,1.2716,0.0008,2.068,5.3306,1.1742,0.5813,0.0482,1.6312,2.6734,0.974,4.9412,1.1776,0.334,0.0088,2.9659,2.1708,3.901,6.2889,0.7143,2.8685,0.0434,2.2419,3.573,2.3234,0.55,1.7438,0.2372,3.2626,6.3293,8.04,1.2993,3.3309,5.3889,6.6571,5.2856,1.0648,2.1559,3.7198,0.201,0.1127,5.5797,2.1331,2.5995,2.5703,2.8653,4.1967,1.8735,0.0012,3.0449,1.5373,2.972,0.05,3.5759,3.2481,3.4899,0.0022,0.6215,4.9111,7.1587,6.5015,4.4402,1.2444,0.7897,5.5879,6.2984,0.1846,0.0057,0.0001,1.2688,6.3355,1.2257,3.0885,7.3841,0.0296,6.3892,3.4822,4.9663,4.0464,7.7546,3.6406,2.7998,2.5399,4.1317,0.3353,4.1952,6.3196,4.3792,0.2208,1.4697,2.2374,0.092,0.0031,0.0002,0.6146,2.7708,1.5228,3.5372,2.4937,5.077,1.0131,3.2435,1.2143,5.1636,3.2661,3.1022,1.4658,0.8787,3.428,0.7991,2.2601,0.0002,1.7089,3.5662,0.1207,1.1233,1.2498,1.768,0.8171,0.0017,1.8148,4.1025,1.3181,1.2245,1.6516,5.0349,1.8265,3.1328,0.0716,2.0117,5.4756,3.521,0.089,0.001,5.7594,5.2285,0.3784,3.3319,1.4524,5.6731,3.8236,0.8242,2.5112,1.9925,0.0016,1.212,4.153,0.4442,5.6308,2.4231,6.0558,0.6466,2.5995,4.1543,1.7703,0.4195,3.198,3.3034,3.645,2.2334,0.0023,0.0005,0.8553,2.3755,3.5451,5.5542,3.5656,2.3623,1.2188,2.4334,0.6712,3.4381,0.7153,1.6121,4.5798,7.5262,2.1583,4.5092,0.1317,3.9605,5.8891,0.5236,0.3347,0.8697,4.022,1.7193,2.6378,2.3426,1.5762,5.1128,0.0353,4.7213,6.1485,0.1954,0.6632,0.855,0.0002,5.9096,0.0733,0.2354,5.9187,1.1828,4.1388,0.0427,5.4623,0.0147,1.3102,5.8955,0.7201,2.3712,4.743,3.7009,4.8129,3.2019,0.0348,2.1378,3.3907,3.2174,0.1667,1.6825,0.3184,2.2453,2.2946,7.0681,0.8577,6.7189,1.4034,2.2678,6.2068,5.9209,8.4283,6.2147,4.8579,5.0351,1.1878,1.2196,0.2708,3.9619,5.2428,0.2485,0.4739,2.6673,4.4006,5.3171,3.2651,2.5631,2.9769,2.6042,3.1421,5.871,2.2552,0.34,2.25,1.871,4.0546,3.9784,2.4024,2.6315,2.8387,0.0072,0.6816,1.4309,0.7494,4.336,2.9776,3.2784,3.3596,0.3505,0.4236,0.155,1.2896,0.0002,2.6321,4.0717,2.4555,0.4096,2.0118,0.685,2.0871,0.2849,0.0009,0.8417,2.9618,0.8342,0.9538,0.6816,2.7781,0.8175,6.75,0.0559,5.0901,0.8742,1.7969,4.3452,3.6814,3.3363,2.0981,2.2586,5.8085,2.4186,0.0046,6.8312,8.6909,3.0283,4.3304,1.7215,0.4284,0.5106,0.4379,3.4383,0.9408,0.001,1.0102,4.1169,7.0284,1.0478,0.4759,3.9316,1.8122,1.8047,1.583,4.059,3.8222,0.86,1.0187,2.2161,0.7986,4.5321,0.0005,5.9372,2.1008,4.6458,2.7141,0.162,2.5552,4.1784,1.873,3.4173,7.5219,3.9602,1.632,4.5826,2.7982,0.238,3.3166,2.4985,2.8051,2.727,2.0361,1.1554,0.0036,3.8934,0.5946,3.9167,1.6678,0.128,1.8356,0.4321,0.4898,0.0001,6.0934]}

An agreement was made with the municipal council, where the latter gave a credit loan to the airline. The route to Molde, Moldavia, was proposed by the Russian private airline VIAB. Then, on October 29th, 2007, Russian companies began a two year expansion of the airline by converting the Vairopov Airlines to an Airline Express. On December 2nd, 2010, the airline operated a flight from Moldavia to Moldavia via Irkutsk (Moscow), Novosibirsk and Pestoril and landed in Minsk on 3 March 2012. On October 3rd, 2012, VILD had left Moldavia on its departure from Irkutsk and entered Prudnorsk as its last air to Moldavia. VILD is part of VIAB's VIAB Group of companies. VILD holds a 30.2% shareholding in Vildanden Aviation.\n\nIn 2011, Vildanden purchased 100% of the Vildanden Aviation Holding Company (MDC) that was controlled by Russian businessman Sergei Duslohov.\n\nThe first runway and runway for Vildanden was constructed in 2007, as a joint venture between Vildanden Aviation Holding Company, Vildanden Aviation Private Company and Aerocity Airlines. Vildanden Aviation Private Company operates a number of airports throughout Moldavia. Vildanden Airport is one of the oldest of Moldavia\u2019s airports, having been built of stone for most of the 20th century. Moldavia was first established as the capital of Moldavia in 1830 by the Alexander Krak\u00f3w in 1776.\n\nFollowing the creation of the first major airline in the Moldavian Republic (Moldavia Aerocity), many aircraft with MDC-2 and VILD-2 aircraft were exported to Russia, France, Germany and Poland, but none were built in Moldavia.\n\nSince the beginning of the MDC era, Vildanden Aviation Holding Company, VILD-2 and its subsidiaries have been engaged in various activities in the Moldavian area as well as in Russia, Poland, Romania, Ukraine, Moldavia and Bulgaria.\n\nReferences","token_len":466,"entropy":[8.7838,5.0444,0.2313,6.8157,7.7142,9.0549,4.2791,2.1964,4.5511,9.4609,2.5538,1.6922,1.2996,5.9519,5.3692,1.0742,2.4401,1.1725,1.1834,8.0178,2.2526,2.9881,3.8668,2.6402,6.9621,5.1454,3.4819,7.4921,6.3283,1.2064,1.5505,8.3856,1.7624,1.8289,8.8912,2.2604,10.3161,5.1457,3.3205,5.4706,3.8107,0.4422,0.6774,6.9586,1.4856,1.3448,6.8207,5.9851,1.362,3.6249,5.4024,3.5662,1.2433,5.873,1.1953,1.9673,1.4994,3.1447,2.0928,0.2399,2.2476,0.0492,6.2298,5.6231,3.1211,3.6567,5.4697,2.3531,5.3028,1.0978,0.8478,2.4587,3.658,6.8025,1.6607,4.5188,7.5486,5.7595,4.11,5.366,1.6875,2.834,4.1501,3.0945,3.4531,1.0753,3.8482,2.3616,2.9977,0.0883,0.0827,4.0559,0.1274,1.2991,1.1608,5.2284,2.5713,2.9327,0.7569,2.1835,1.5761,0.1557,1.8418,0.998,3.933,6.8823,0.4772,0.0157,0.0015,3.647,4.453,2.329,6.5525,1.432,0.0018,0.0004,0.0002,1.8556,5.0878,4.7746,3.8057,5.7056,4.3707,4.3528,0.9075,4.9149,0.2429,2.1408,5.741,3.2167,2.3111,0.196,2.7775,3.6368,3.6439,0.0289,0.0866,0.8684,0.1227,1.302,5.7506,4.854,6.4127,1.1088,0.1989,3.9874,2.084,6.258,0.9379,2.4551,0.002,0.0016,0.0023,1.7127,3.7179,7.4257,2.5931,4.0825,5.7832,0.0057,4.5232,4.2576,3.3598,5.5796,7.5678,1.7167,0.0557,0.3991,2.5671,0.4066,4.3413,5.2558,0.0228,3.1217,2.1847,0.02,1.8659,4.7383,3.7183,0.7136,3.4453,3.2972,3.3541,0.8765,2.2021,0.456,6.3482,1.8421,5.123,2.8569,3.0394,0.2,1.2117,3.6586,0.1616,1.2442,5.0713,0.7016,0.0612,3.7619,1.0338,1.188,0.0103,2.4689,3.8508,0.2476,0.73,1.7122,0.0155,0.0035,4.0377,6.8213,0.655,0.2765,1.4346,3.7682,5.1494,0.4003,0.1134,1.4102,4.1233,0.8305,1.3741,7.6186,8.6091,0.8202,4.6939,1.3964,4.7241,0.0338,3.8669,2.5179,3.9477,4.5035,6.4428,7.0555,5.618,1.5906,0.9613,2.9083,0.0002,2.909,3.4526,7.4841,5.0127,2.6504,4.5614,0.9446,0.7853,0.0046,0.004,1.8891,2.9179,0.7289,3.9683,2.1546,4.2229,2.4406,2.9823,0.0986,0.3544,0.8152,1.3667,0.0067,0.0107,0.7089,1.4496,0.5304,2.7406,1.7112,3.1138,0.1625,0.1936,1.2286,8.1718,3.7284,1.073,5.3275,8.618,3.6939,0.7029,2.6005,0.264,0.007,0.0061,1.3958,3.4095,0.1769,3.9851,2.0985,2.7172,0.0009,2.9648,3.5683,2.9083,0.9647,1.1394,1.9352,0.1883,0.0072,0.0101,3.2151,1.3107,2.7858,0.0299,0.515,3.3677,4.4035,3.3545,0.1944,14.1179,6.7106,6.319,1.2137,1.7549,2.6342,0.627,1.5655,6.8964,4.9093,2.6327,6.1714,0.0573,0.6817,2.5465,0.0133,0.0883,0.3768,5.7798,0.0944,2.7893,2.7918,2.792,1.659,2.5482,1.4252,0.2912,2.7345,0.1388,1.046,5.8713,2.0593,1.0045,6.2843,4.2406,6.6066,2.9004,0.2369,5.6566,4.5082,3.4746,0.4563,2.3695,0.0002,5.4377,0.5779,5.2369,0.0195,0.6433,2.9853,5.1227,3.776,0.755,1.7969,5.3502,1.7355,0.0627,2.7483,4.0106,1.9859,1.1793,0.6147,6.0533,7.0191,0.945,6.2525,4.5675,5.1797,5.4975,0.2582,3.2296,5.0093,2.9279,2.151,1.7867,0.3565,0.5039,2.6089,0.6965,4.9952,0.5497,2.7037,1.9643,4.5226,0.4538,1.3728,1.0021,4.1679,2.4482,3.851,3.0492,1.4236,2.3529,1.2494,0.9743,0.0185,0.3641,1.5801,0.0002,4.8498,1.3432,2.0743,0.0572,0.4655,4.7028,1.2882,2.572,0.4294,1.1636,0.6862,0.0065,0.0056,0.4232,4.0627,0.0625,2.4709,0.6236,0.7378,1.9417,0.1989,1.4785,5.8719,0.7007,0.334,1.6199,4.7265,0.1282,2.8679,1.9991,1.5751,1.0593,4.0467,0.3498,0.0046,5.7545,4.2092,0.7773,0.2658,0.8973,2.8838,1.502,3.6234,0.5564,2.742,0.541,2.9002,0.7074,2.6277,3.3147,0.7938,2.8989,0.2103,1.0944,0.0002,5.7039]}

{"id":1246,"ended":false,"length":431,"text":"In 1930, with his impending marriage in mind, Olivier earned some extra money with small roles in two films. In April he travelled to Berlin to film the English @ - @, the final, French adaptation of Arthur Conan Doyle's classic novel, based on an account of the incident at the time, while working as a waiter. An enthusiastic reader of the novel, Charles Doyle wrote \"A good man, a sensible man.... must never fail to find a way. And so he will leave those who love him, the very people whom he loved.\" (An Evening With Arthur Conan and Richard Henry, 1939, 3).\n\nIn October 1938, Olivier earned only $100 in wages from the French film production team that had earlier employed him as a waiter. At the end of his film career he wrote \"Les Orbits\", his latest and last film.\n\nIn September 1939, a Paris court case prompted Charles to announce that Olivier had been given orders for the production of his novel to be cancelled or put back on hold. The court case followed the release of the full edition of Doyle's \"Arthur Conan the Barbarian\", a work entitled, \"Arthur Conan the Barbarian\". Both \"Les Orbits\" and \"Les Orbits\" took place in a French courtroom and Olivier's novel was banned. The court case was eventually heard as part of the trial of the French novelist Bernard Toussaint. The final edition of the novel, based on Doyle's \"The Dark Knight\", was released after a few weeks.\n\nThe French Court also granted Olivier the right to take part in the production of the film \"Les Orbits-Franche-Ventures\", although the production was deemed to pose a threat to the production of the film and the film's reputation.\n\nIn August 1940, it was announced that Olivier made two films with Raymond Bontillier - a British actor. He returned to London in 1943 to write and produce, but the film was banned by the French court. In 1944, Olivier returned to Paris to read a final draft of the screenplay. At the time, he wrote an adaptation of Doyle's novel \"Les Orbits-Franche-Ventures\", also based on the story.\n\nCultural and filmography\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links","token_len":467,"entropy":[11.0736,0.3097,5.3864,2.7869,7.985,5.3192,4.352,5.9278,0.075,10.3865,6.8673,4.7892,5.2155,1.1981,4.1396,7.6819,4.8754,0.3693,5.0838,2.3894,1.9276,2.1079,6.1833,5.8075,7.8561,0.2255,4.2888,0.8356,2.5622,1.8164,7.5762,13.0384,7.8777,6.4487,3.8481,3.1425,5.3508,5.1533,6.7416,5.2885,0.1053,4.6364,1.7146,0.0019,0.0272,2.6836,1.7822,1.6301,6.992,0.0779,3.6656,3.2634,0.6664,1.4777,6.2202,2.8104,0.8252,6.0751,2.5048,4.9232,3.9785,1.4775,0.3759,4.2045,2.213,6.1082,5.5456,4.395,0.7669,1.3014,2.0281,0.3165,6.7773,5.6556,3.7235,4.4032,3.3727,5.7076,2.947,2.8195,2.0268,6.5968,0.3745,6.6914,8.2357,4.1959,4.6,0.2826,4.2383,1.8916,2.1033,5.4005,3.2516,3.0981,2.1755,3.7046,5.8876,6.3558,1.2559,4.0068,0.1438,2.5024,3.4961,5.2663,1.9951,2.4719,0.3377,3.3234,2.3173,3.4048,5.6206,5.0764,1.7606,4.6265,0.0043,12.7072,4.9642,5.8447,2.2792,4.9046,1.7412,6.7367,2.9139,1.0675,0.0221,1.9063,4.1728,3.2626,0.1934,2.183,4.9937,7.1507,1.7222,3.5488,2.1143,5.5154,2.7839,1.6336,3.8283,3.2717,3.249,5.7051,4.5454,2.1045,6.9893,5.151,0.6715,2.3116,0.6416,1.7933,0.6715,4.3428,0.6833,1.674,0.0222,2.309,5.3103,0.537,2.4945,4.4659,2.4461,5.2218,7.4754,7.8142,3.6496,4.2713,5.5774,4.2206,3.1201,2.8718,1.2568,1.9286,0.0002,1.7562,3.6275,0.8267,0.2617,4.236,6.17,2.47,5.3564,5.9996,6.2777,1.8787,5.0954,0.9971,2.6954,1.4961,1.2489,3.8762,7.1191,2.3129,1.9311,1.8973,0.1097,1.7616,3.5113,5.2796,0.3577,3.28,5.7506,5.5733,1.9521,0.5659,0.5689,0.6797,2.0663,2.6912,3.0911,5.4636,2.0882,3.3934,0.0828,1.371,6.7851,4.1867,0.1877,7.146,0.0172,3.0143,4.8404,0.0233,9.0902,2.728,1.8975,2.6927,4.5092,6.6632,3.3276,0.4309,3.1375,0.104,0.8944,1.0656,2.6053,6.3183,5.2147,4.0229,0.0299,0.0009,0.0523,0.0712,0.2997,0.3086,0.1074,0.0044,0.8905,5.4815,0.4088,0.6682,2.8308,3.5088,6.2171,2.7176,4.112,1.9832,2.8988,0.7729,4.4223,1.8354,2.2934,2.4959,1.2144,1.3871,2.9426,3.4292,5.0314,1.1064,0.0006,0.958,2.4044,0.4501,1.8747,3.0774,3.0784,5.3514,5.3043,3.2783,0.3174,0.0196,1.3765,2.4797,4.4748,3.5993,0.2394,0.9583,0.7651,1.6313,5.0545,0.0724,3.685,0.0344,2.2229,1.8135,5.2027,1.0985,1.1968,0.3648,1.512,5.2165,2.3946,3.4399,1.3746,1.2463,0.5515,0.0001,3.1824,3.0465,4.3679,5.5525,4.4735,0.8121,1.8373,0.5855,0.0729,4.308,0.9212,0.0142,1.0331,1.6157,0.0526,1.6355,2.9295,2.3783,1.7645,0.5401,0.0011,7.6152,7.2786,4.267,5.673,4.5539,5.3583,3.8274,1.2959,5.3428,1.9122,3.5149,2.1521,6.2118,1.589,7.2155,0.6367,1.7334,0.047,0.6921,3.4518,0.811,0.6971,1.5067,3.0524,1.6463,3.1731,1.0547,2.9396,0.6397,1.5417,0.0001,0.9838,3.3947,0.6203,0.2259,5.8383,0.0956,1.3405,0.1216,0.3626,6.3368,4.4092,1.0651,2.8546,7.8941,4.3787,5.001,8.6069,0.8008,4.4668,2.5025,4.0189,2.345,2.8936,2.3455,5.4389,0.2878,3.2976,1.3101,4.0808,1.3575,3.3541,2.5376,3.202,4.0434,2.4929,2.7677,2.2782,1.0087,2.9136,2.0788,0.3305,1.4875,1.8787,0.716,2.2034,2.7423,0.5078,1.2712,2.9336,0.1085,0.9194,0.9718,6.0229,2.6348,5.9093,2.3552,0.2016,0.8718,2.6241,2.177,4.6162,0.4396,2.05,0.6891,1.5727,2.6001,3.9692,3.1972,0.137,3.0793,0.0138,2.3386,1.6028,1.874,0.1323,0.0004,1.2614,0.4696,0.0016,0.1684,0.0612,0.0125,0.0035,1.4085,6.0073,1.9245,0.0312,1.6838,3.1467,2.6062,1.2007,0.0001,6.6897,3.7006,2.8753,8.3714,6.2934,1.2628,0.0001,7.4226,0.8452,0.0003,3.2562,2.8581,0.3986,0.0002,5.2885,0.2358]}

In his anger he makes the rash oath that the wolf `` mot have been found'' on the land. The oxen, he says, can be \"drilled to ruin'' by the very soil they have built. This is the beginning of another conflict between the husbandman and his oxen.\n\nBucklin said the wife was told by the local farmer that the wife should pay much attention to the field she was working and make sure she had the oxen up to speed and that they never needed to be moved due to the high risk of flooding.\n\nSo Bucklin and the wife got up to leave but had to turn round because everything was in danger as Bucklin drove to the town. Bucklin pulled in his back and said he would find them. The women were furious. They tried to explain to Bucklin, but he did nothing. Bucklin said he felt sorry for them and had to get back there right away. He did not tell the wife but his men went to investigate.\n\nThe wife had been told that Bucklin had no use for the oxen but that he would take it if the wife brought it back to me. Bucklin got up and walked up to the house. He noticed that the wife was carrying the oxen. Then he tried to leave but they took the oxen to the town hall. But they left when Bucklin said they would come back when I told them to.\n\nSo Bucklin said he would bring the oxen back to the village and that the locals would then pay the oxen. He went near the town centre again and found the wife of a farmer and his wife in a market. They were sitting in front of the market and had made many purchases. The women were laughing and giggling until they all laughed and had trouble getting over the annoyance and the feeling that Bucklin was angry with them.\n\nBucklin was then taken to jail. He was fined 10,000 riyals and ordered to pay an amount of 400 riyals each in the next 24 hours.\n\nBucklin says he will be getting his oxen back by the end of November.","token_len":467,"entropy":[9.9983,8.4996,8.2807,5.8112,1.2514,2.6956,2.9315,1.2705,5.3653,4.6126,5.6165,3.4357,4.9234,1.1219,3.2745,7.4246,11.7243,1.155,3.6746,11.8231,0.7079,1.6702,1.6279,4.6399,0.8057,3.9429,2.8705,2.8496,1.2224,3.9531,2.2505,9.9052,6.9385,1.8171,2.571,6.5671,14.7114,15.4456,7.7521,2.5266,4.7454,3.7247,4.9176,0.6445,2.4595,1.2744,1.8555,2.3877,0.3412,2.5065,2.9125,0.7939,0.06,4.9233,1.7985,5.0126,5.9321,3.6224,3.6649,6.7828,1.9577,1.8459,1.2359,6.807,7.8507,1.4606,2.2574,4.8686,0.879,3.6971,1.3815,1.6644,6.0185,0.0514,6.5583,5.854,1.1619,1.2092,3.3586,0.4586,0.1413,0.9408,0.6117,0.0497,0.5563,2.4465,0.0199,5.2231,4.0443,5.4893,4.7266,2.6149,3.8645,3.8683,5.2539,1.7429,1.5517,5.6197,2.9746,0.5441,1.4703,4.2387,3.9988,4.4568,6.9936,2.8737,0.0723,0.8018,5.0822,2.709,1.1484,3.3468,3.1593,4.7947,0.8361,1.9965,2.0533,2.4138,4.5525,0.0674,5.9823,1.2085,3.0293,3.3775,2.7952,2.419,3.8017,6.0114,0.8411,1.8029,5.1664,7.3579,0.0092,0.9747,4.5857,3.4092,0.494,4.8817,0.4293,1.981,0.0002,5.462,3.2918,0.0313,2.4366,1.9803,1.8723,4.6099,3.1047,1.7024,3.0934,4.6254,4.747,0.4338,4.7123,4.7008,3.5732,7.5752,0.7435,3.6923,2.8839,5.1839,5.4775,0.026,4.6763,4.0334,0.8053,4.2111,1.1886,3.183,0.0029,5.6656,4.4741,2.466,5.6143,1.9353,2.6864,2.1879,2.1872,4.7723,3.438,1.8628,1.8799,4.8283,2.3217,4.4223,2.0936,1.1453,4.5496,0.1317,4.7543,1.3884,0.5737,0.0014,3.6566,1.6666,1.273,4.0134,2.5174,0.4215,3.2898,0.0035,1.9496,1.5429,5.5289,2.8923,0.1007,0.9457,1.3569,4.4589,1.5694,3.1592,2.7341,6.4538,7.0128,0.0448,0.2595,2.2472,4.4992,0.8827,3.8767,1.2514,1.4008,3.6541,4.1515,3.2547,3.3124,1.8317,5.1376,1.1364,1.1358,0.0001,1.8384,1.9866,3.443,2.4878,2.9003,1.3298,3.0041,0.0051,1.0122,4.9569,6.2762,0.1331,2.0114,1.2155,0.0485,2.9793,1.6947,1.6127,2.0529,3.0503,4.1483,2.9653,2.7809,3.3911,5.1543,0.6749,1.5578,2.1217,6.6612,0.4082,1.6433,0.0044,4.5422,1.2641,0.9547,3.5118,3.0161,0.4293,0.4863,1.7766,1.4094,1.1636,5.0084,1.2079,0.8506,2.7462,0.752,4.7564,2.0121,1.0287,0.0977,1.8929,4.2507,0.6131,5.6591,0.1404,5.0367,0.8099,3.358,4.718,2.4677,0.4054,0.04,2.5185,1.0194,4.2586,4.2556,0.7595,4.6951,2.4138,4.3633,4.3559,0.5743,0.0048,3.218,1.9753,1.499,3.003,0.677,3.7601,3.9097,3.4552,0.3662,2.0295,0.8355,1.0421,0.0001,4.2795,0.5922,0.0041,3.2961,0.9025,1.0775,3.8652,0.919,0.3683,0.0204,0.4907,1.3437,1.0994,2.876,1.5815,2.8585,2.5621,7.9551,0.3255,5.8218,3.4725,2.38,3.4091,0.0056,2.1921,2.3715,2.8867,7.719,0.5403,1.7414,7.6069,5.7097,0.7438,1.6626,1.237,1.1904,5.4421,2.3532,1.8999,3.2737,2.984,2.2691,3.1408,1.6691,6.7841,1.0091,1.792,1.9105,4.2371,1.6235,3.2878,0.0217,0.7544,1.9709,1.5432,4.6603,5.0576,5.1357,4.4145,0.8124,2.0977,3.3443,1.5407,5.911,1.3228,6.2122,0.0172,6.8356,2.0928,4.471,5.1071,1.6788,4.9314,6.8921,2.5904,4.4674,1.2528,7.1301,3.1984,1.8435,4.9364,1.3371,2.2456,0.0067,1.0417,4.4748,1.9767,0.2411,0.3678,0.8329,0.0001,1.4046,0.0113,0.0033,2.9122,3.8423,3.3365,0.714,4.2847,1.2121,1.2219,0.854,3.2184,4.8936,0.9911,0.0374,3.4413,3.8514,0.8271,1.2939,2.3902,0.0423,0.8979,3.7388,2.7949,0.8722,4.6933,2.4079,0.0053,0.0238,3.7949,3.7982,2.6381,3.9013,4.9176,0.2185,0.3222,1.6572,0.0002,2.1928,0.0351,0.004,4.578,0.8309,3.7715,2.5073,5.6114,2.765,5.6296,0.0218,0.17,3.9034,1.2805,0.8709,0.0019,4.6169,0.5782]}
{"id":1463,"ended":false,"length":416,"text":"Helms and his friend Shannon Moore signed with World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) in May 1999. In WCW, Helms, along with Moore and Evan Karagias, formed the heel ( villainous force that dominated the television coverage) character of ZZ Top, a heel who would later become the face of WWF, WCW and a two time world champion in ROH, the world champion of WWF between 1997 and 2001.\n\nDuring Wrestlemania XXIII Helms started running with a special style called \"Inky\", where he would wear the heels and make a very specific match and would make a random and very unexpected appearance. Helms first appeared in ROH in 1999. Following the initial shock of ROH\u2019s departure from ROH, the promotion shifted and was replaced by the US. With ROH he was briefly a part of The Ultimate Warrior and Triple H but was replaced in 2003 with Bobby Lashley and remained in that capacity until 2008, where he was replaced by John Cena ( who had previously made inroads into both WWF and ROH ). In addition he later appeared in WWE as an occasional guest star on the television show Zippo!, appearing as a recurring guest on the second annual World Wrestling Championships in July 2015 and August 2016, and being a recurring guest on the WWE Universe\u2019s TV show, Wacky Razzers in February 2018. A main event appearance appearance was made in August 2016 at The Biggest Loser, where he was replaced as the main act with RKO by Bryan Rust who was replaced by Shane McMahon.

Sakuraba primarily worked on the battle themes and arrangements of previous themes, while Tamura handled selected boss battle tracks and melodies.  When the band was disbanded, they were replaced by a local duo called Fume, who started the process of making the band sound distinctive and experimental in its own right.\n\nAfter making \"A New Way To Die\" for their fifth album, Fume recorded a live song on the band's home stage, \"Dissolve.\" This song ended up being very popular in Japan and became popular on the Japanese Idol circuit.  The song was popularized in Japan as a parody of the popular songs of the period.  The songs that have become Japan's popular and most well known songs have become classics as well.  \"Dissolve\" has become a leading hit in Japan, becoming the most successful single to top the list in Japan as of 2009.\n\n\"A New Way To Die\" is in the band's third song, which has been heavily edited.

The studs or ribs can be located on the inside, outside, or both ; alternatively, they can have a single stud or ribs.\n\nIn addition, condoms can be placed on the inside of your partner, usually on the left or right side of your body while having the desired position ; or, the condom can be placed on top of your partner; or, the condom can be placed on the bottom of your partner\u2019s neck, in the groin.\n\nThis is because condoms can help to decrease the risk of pregnancy while minimizing any possible complications during pregnancy. Also, when used effectively, the condoms may help to relax your partner\u2019s back muscles and prevent bleeding.\n\nAnother way to help to prevent pregnancy is to use condoms in conjunction with a condom with a zipper attachment. Most women wear a zipper-type condom that they use to wrap around the condom or on the top of their partner\u2019s thighs. These inserts will also help close all of the condoms inside the condom and protect the condom from scratches, stains and any other unwanted particles, or debris.\n\nThe first layer and layer covering the insert can be found on the underside of the insert.\n\nOn top of this material. the zipper will allow you to remove the insert or insert from the cover of your condom and free the insert from the zipper attachment.\n\nOne third of those layers being adhered to the elastic side of the insert,,,,,. also will help to loosen the insert,,,,,,, and the cover of the penis and penis-penis barrier.\n\nThere are 5 different kinds of zipper attachments available. each can be found on the penis insert.

{"id":4160,"ended":false,"length":444,"text":"Throughout the regular season, a constant question hanging over the Virginia Tech Hokies football team was whether or not star quarterback Michael Vick would return for another year at the school. The National Coach of the Year received a one-game ban after he publicly stated that Vick \"is not the right quarterback for the program\". However, Vick is an attractive prospect for anyone with the chance to win a Heisman Trophy. A lot of Virginia Tech fans did not recognize the former Duke running back's ability. However, Vick will leave Virginia Tech soon and the Hokies don't have very much chance of staying up if they don't play him.\nOn one hand, Vick has played two seasons for Duke. However, if you had to pick one team that could improve the Hokies and perhaps a lot of the teams they play to improve, they could try to convince Vince Biegelman to leave Virginia Tech. The Hokies got away from Vick due to his inexperience, but even in his first year at the redshirt-year club Vick has proven to be an underrated quarterback. He has seen a total of 30 touchdowns and just one interception. The Hokies fans were disappointed, however. A lot of Hokies don't know that Vick is coming back for another season, but it would be nice to see him in this year's football program\nRashard Higgins is certainly worth getting excited about. He is an extremely talented QB who has never played the game at another major college school. It's a great way to prepare for your NFL season. There are many teams in college that offer offers for quarterbacks and this one may just be the right one. It could also be a win-win situation for the Hokies right now if they choose to offer Higgins the Heisman.\nRashard Higgins is a quarterback who has won multiple Heisman Trophy and MVP votes. He is a talented prospect to watch, and it would be nice to see the Hokies put on some face value at quarterback. However, the Hokies will need to sign his brother, Ryan to a deal to come up with a better offer and the best position to do so is right here in Virginia. This will all come down to who is better as they go. It will most certainly be Vick, but what's the best position for Virginia Tech at quarterback in the NBA?","token_len":469,"entropy":[1.9201,8.9235,0.2857,0.2795,4.7561,6.7958,5.969,8.0435,0.1305,1.1187,11.06,1.3185,4.1381,0.029,3.8095,1.3125,2.2447,1.4661,2.1162,0.0012,8.3753,1.3438,5.7139,1.1658,0.8113,2.8307,1.8155,4.9568,3.1376,2.5769,1.5225,2.3183,0.2652,2.7811,9.3371,6.929,0.1262,0.0352,0.0276,5.8913,1.4332,5.6019,0.1445,2.5141,2.99,3.4219,2.5579,4.3566,2.8394,0.7171,1.1154,3.664,3.2932,1.2101,3.5068,2.8862,1.4541,0.8594,1.2335,2.5682,3.5935,3.6775,0.0443,2.024,3.0617,3.9049,5.9499,1.8966,1.2125,4.9457,2.952,1.7302,4.6269,0.2306,3.3187,0.9692,2.6794,0.1501,0.7887,4.7827,3.9498,0.3434,5.1216,0.0939,0.3722,6.27,0.2619,6.2752,1.3374,4.7261,5.6516,3.4086,0.0066,2.7343,4.4504,4.2379,3.7176,0.02,2.7029,3.9087,5.7754,1.8624,0.0495,4.059,1.2679,2.6346,1.4352,0.0041,5.1641,0.0005,1.1608,6.6193,1.3111,4.5864,0.6377,5.6703,4.6502,4.8015,1.9173,1.5885,0.0004,3.8426,2.2125,1.155,0.6147,9.758,4.812,0.1793,0.0363,1.4608,2.2159,3.7816,5.9343,0.7491,2.8733,1.7149,1.5005,2.5954,0.0108,4.3742,2.9225,4.6159,1.006,0.8398,1.254,2.7668,1.3751,2.5728,6.245,2.6685,4.1536,0.0169,3.7554,5.9523,4.5049,3.3307,0.3102,2.4935,4.1224,3.3,1.6751,5.4657,3.7586,1.7672,3.1735,2.942,7.0378,0.572,5.8832,6.6211,3.8242,0.0629,6.7312,0.7188,2.3552,2.2945,0.0753,0.6463,2.5088,1.3119,0.0064,6.425,4.8137,2.3381,5.3678,4.3594,0.0093,1.7391,5.4814,0.0004,2.364,0.9684,5.0681,3.9382,1.4787,1.1754,0.9678,2.1505,2.6034,8.2679,0.0293,3.5944,4.1076,5.934,4.4623,2.7406,4.1311,0.745,0.0957,2.0767,5.1216,2.5711,0.5937,2.1777,1.2899,5.423,2.7011,5.6787,0.0413,4.7578,2.6029,1.2138,4.4454,2.0227,0.3029,1.7055,2.9881,1.312,0.0065,6.2052,2.8878,3.3929,3.7148,2.1559,3.1699,4.1005,1.1698,0.0614,6.4179,0.0393,6.56,0.0006,2.3371,1.8266,1.6348,1.2144,3.7648,0.123,2.1118,0.7548,1.0745,2.0521,1.096,2.6229,2.9233,0.4843,1.7169,0.6722,0.7516,1.5348,4.4166,4.9008,1.2959,0.0266,4.9002,3.1899,8.2497,6.0273,4.929,0.6831,0.515,2.1841,7.1144,3.9005,5.6295,2.1225,0.1087,0.7755,1.8024,1.6175,2.4829,2.5214,0.9257,3.9335,1.3782,1.2642,4.5028,1.6708,3.2532,1.82,2.7127,6.6649,4.382,0.5773,4.4488,0.4726,4.605,2.3149,2.5656,2.6617,3.8416,0.2137,5.9274,0.6806,3.2834,4.5693,1.9114,1.0269,4.6744,0.8555,2.1293,3.6334,1.9641,2.3544,3.917,4.7654,6.2419,2.1589,1.2617,2.1987,4.0684,2.9827,4.6228,3.6295,0.4385,0.5474,3.0936,0.7431,0.6834,3.4195,3.6315,2.841,0.3454,1.0776,4.8075,1.3385,0.0447,1.4326,0.4468,0.7146,0.3976,0.0031,7.1337,0.3904,3.1561,1.1725,4.2939,0.1975,4.1145,0.4398,2.0709,6.7551,0.9336,1.0683,3.4401,0.1556,0.0097,0.6642,1.0481,1.2257,4.7504,1.2188,1.0831,4.4002,3.6085,2.9633,1.4465,1.9929,5.2112,5.4867,0.8524,0.9273,1.5391,1.3222,3.6139,3.0567,6.1857,0.954,2.766,1.8249,3.2094,1.3079,0.1648,0.5469,0.2277,0.1117,2.6813,0.4386,0.0036,4.2963,4.8686,2.4535,7.0127,4.4495,3.2451,2.23,0.5329,3.235,0.0114,2.1524,1.3035,0.0054,2.9148,1.6647,0.5895,5.015,5.0761,4.5523,1.5046,4.6028,5.0909,0.6058,2.6906,2.4958,4.695,3.7375,0.6765,0.6033,3.2787,3.3806,3.3568,3.5802,4.0573,4.3577,1.395,2.829,0.3358,2.1785,4.0263,2.8407,1.0796,1.3483,1.0958,3.6631,3.2137,5.3071,2.3843,0.1053,0.0068,2.6327,1.6245,2.1986,4.8091,4.2967,3.2704,2.3166,3.6618,2.1604,5.3742,2.4335,0.8244,5.4868,1.6146,0.9541,4.6872,4.2715,1.9566,1.5779,1.8959,0.8081,5.0197,0.1728,4.3975,0.4507,3.6317,1.0488,6.1867,0.4801]}
{"id":1167,"ended":true,"length":401,"text":"According to Sify, Pokiri took an `` extraordinary `` opening across the globe and was able to cash in on the four @ - @ day weekend holiday. Pokiri was released in a $10,000 deposit, and the company says it will receive a bonus of $3,800 to $5,000 on December 16th. \"\n\nPokiri's business is well-known. But now, they have more cash to splash, according to Sify. The company has $21.1 million invested in Pokiri, reports Crain's.\n\nThe news comes after a report by Wall Street Journal that Pokiri's new CEO, Mr. Rajesh Khanna, had said last November that the company aims to have about $45 million invested in a portfolio of companies. The company just completed a $7.1 million renovation on a luxury boutique hotel in Bangkok. The hotel was a \"stunning investment\", the company revealed, but is in dire financial state.\n\nPokiri has been under intense scrutiny for its investment in food and pharmaceutical giant Sino-Malaysia Business Corporation. The Sino-Malaysia business has had huge financial challenges for years. The Asian food major is facing a long line of foreign workers as food processors like Thai, Malaysian and Vietnamese compete with the United States for jobs in many industries.\n\nSify recently bought a 10-square-foot retail mall in Beijing. Sify Chief Financial Officer Yim Chen and Chief Technology Officers Michael Chen and Wong Yu Wai have been tasked with developing business plans to attract more customers. Since the hotel was built at the former Bangkok hotel-turned-casino complex, the mall has been full of customers. In the beginning of the year, Sify reported revenues in the $12.3 billion range, which tops analyst expectations.\n\nPokiri has raised the $200 million capital it has pledged to invest in its businesses. It has paid off more than $800 million in debt with an initial allocation of $30 million. According to Forbes, the company has raised $120 million in dividends and is likely to spend about $2 billion more in capital. So far, Sify says it has raised $10 million during the last year, of which $12.3 million has gone to the company.","token_len":470,"entropy":[1.9909,6.2279,10.2951,0.6454,11.7511,7.3874,5.8136,3.9576,13.2057,12.7941,7.1906,9.8859,9.2752,0.4548,3.6933,3.1628,4.316,2.2235,0.0255,8.007,0.1522,0.4476,1.2798,8.903,12.31,7.5481,5.6863,8.8147,8.9579,7.7307,3.6711,6.5805,0.0122,2.3037,7.7407,2.9611,2.4188,5.5944,2.8496,1.1902,0.0333,4.3946,2.2137,1.8492,2.7241,3.6842,3.8478,1.1877,1.8548,4.871,1.9108,4.9741,0.3697,0.3941,3.3459,0.6621,4.4352,3.2661,0.7026,0.7768,0.0011,0.3085,4.0817,5.139,3.4319,1.6055,1.4072,3.6962,2.3394,0.0109,3.3567,0.0867,0.0031,1.6158,4.9181,2.3307,4.4502,1.2106,0.5318,2.4464,5.0539,4.9333,1.4074,5.4576,2.2612,4.9443,6.1292,1.5997,6.4097,2.7379,2.6946,0.0012,2.8356,0.0366,0.346,2.3736,0.8694,2.1499,3.4477,5.2414,1.1395,2.8654,0.1936,3.2449,0.3974,1.1511,0.0125,1.4484,6.7354,4.8965,1.8913,0.0175,1.1545,1.2271,0.0003,2.1049,3.77,0.6882,1.8844,2.1743,3.1584,2.3224,6.3163,0.014,0.2427,2.3219,3.2212,0.0104,2.3081,5.0774,2.2702,0.8728,5.4625,0.0669,5.615,3.2038,5.5264,1.2388,0.1093,2.3062,4.1185,4.5471,4.3752,0.2761,1.6889,0.2978,7.2891,0.0518,3.1253,3.7566,0.8477,5.4476,0.5872,1.9802,0.3426,3.4873,5.9155,0.2625,3.3173,2.2313,2.3705,2.0101,6.7054,3.6392,1.1141,0.7034,4.3898,0.7157,2.8614,0.4101,5.6882,3.9022,1.9907,5.2414,4.5116,0.9668,0.7174,4.9845,0.9249,2.6087,2.1562,2.5028,4.0941,5.1927,5.8399,1.1022,4.3547,3.9687,2.229,2.9,6.8823,1.9608,2.5988,4.3453,4.1421,4.8131,1.9005,5.8066,0.4308,0.5715,0.0003,2.7089,0.0804,0.004,2.2633,1.7662,3.0893,2.6808,0.3629,1.6685,1.3866,5.3734,0.4927,6.5091,1.3651,4.8382,4.4165,4.2256,7.0186,1.0492,5.9173,0.1921,0.0793,4.605,5.4613,1.6723,1.6248,4.791,0.2477,0.0699,0.0208,0.0077,0.3796,2.9643,2.4518,4.4241,5.7685,3.3131,5.5462,4.0533,1.9819,1.1601,1.9597,6.8019,4.3516,8.2768,2.2095,3.3379,1.3399,5.1562,4.6317,0.1223,6.0602,5.3473,4.1897,5.4453,4.3333,4.0676,4.9186,2.688,2.1708,0.549,2.2287,4.6646,1.6164,2.4197,3.2544,0.0154,1.0869,3.3008,2.302,6.2204,4.2615,0.3991,0.748,0.0004,3.5095,4.6349,4.424,5.0993,1.8463,4.5277,1.6988,5.7669,0.1042,0.5925,5.3939,4.0327,0.4528,4.8374,1.9887,3.2091,2.3754,6.2062,1.9445,0.0054,5.2214,4.1002,5.0739,4.5137,3.002,4.3787,6.4423,4.8467,4.5032,0.3041,7.2594,3.9425,6.6612,0.2518,2.1014,1.3434,5.3069,0.188,3.7627,5.192,1.8104,2.9305,4.0014,2.7561,4.1632,1.0775,6.6168,1.3575,7.1055,1.9583,1.927,5.0801,1.1029,4.0849,6.7658,3.1409,6.0347,1.8345,0.0227,3.9031,0.0789,4.3993,0.6517,1.3508,2.9439,0.6133,1.5199,6.4325,0.3302,3.4206,1.3267,3.8329,2.506,5.4803,2.0546,2.1317,0.3684,0.1294,1.3727,0.1416,3.6585,4.7808,4.5834,1.2153,2.0274,4.5351,1.0704,2.3258,1.012,0.1137,1.0871,2.716,7.4244,7.0283,2.7433,0.332,0.8797,0.0004,2.5268,0.1002,0.0044,2.1281,4.1377,3.9196,3.1183,4.2351,0.1654,4.441,2.9185,2.7652,5.0709,0.9365,1.5321,0.3956,1.8881,4.703,1.2922,2.2296,1.6011,5.6785,2.4165,3.9077,0.0146,0.1935,5.2553,0.0564,0.4951,1.048,3.8393,4.0762,2.2577,8.5882,0.0375,0.1877,4.1534,0.1572,1.0289,4.1281,0.0016,4.9065,0.3216,1.0511,0.5349,1.3313,2.2366,0.6763,5.8039,0.0637,0.9525,5.9476,1.6258,2.6964,5.2195,0.0659,4.1613,3.1132,0.0824,4.2063,0.9879,3.0129,1.5705,1.9351,2.0704,6.4853,0.1745,0.2353,2.1334,0.0673,2.6204,0.6906,0.4397,0.8405,0.6337,3.7068,0.4647,6.869,0.6439,3.1696,2.5773,1.837,5.8014,0.0939,0.5143,4.1283,1.4232,0.7649,0.0283,0.8924,2.0563,0.4045,2.5442,1.7954,0.7647]}

Titled Senj\u014d no Valkyria 3 : Taga Tame no < unkon - kon : oki gyo. (It was a sequel to Taga, the first game). It will feature original art by Toshio Mori (Koji, the artist behind that visual novel) and a new song & voice by Shintaro Nakajima. The story starts with the story of a young woman (Kouyu Shinmai) who falls in love with a young man (Taro Nakajima), and one day they fall in love again. Soon after, they both lose their passion for life but the love grows stronger as they share and get closer to each other. With all those special moments they have learned to live life on their own without any other expectations. The most important one is that they get to have a fun time together even when they are not able to spend time with each other or even spend any time with each other due to their age. The second one is an animated movie entitled Nakuen no Kanai. It has a lot of plot and interesting characters and I highly recommend reading it and watching it. To enjoy it without ever knowing how much I love this series. My heart went out to Nakuen no Kanai.\n\nThank you for reading my page. I wanted to share this video to you.

Moving across the border in Cambodia on 30 March elements of the PRG and NLF were surrounded in their bunkers by South Vietnamese forces. The PRG, having their first artillery fire in a month, pushed into the town and entered UNF, causing serious damage. The South Vietnamese forces in Phnom Penh quickly fired their assault units. Within four hours they surrounded the city of Ha Nhau, with many local businesses and schools being closed. A second day of attacks on the PRG set in. On 1 February the PRG withdrew and the war was ended\u2026On 16 February the PRG withdrew again. Following the initial attack by the PRG on Ha Nhau, there were also attacks and the UN General Assembly building on the RTC. After the attacks on the PRG on Ha Nhau on 3 March, Viet Nam joined the War of the Roses, as stated by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in January 2004. On 30 March the PRG returned to its place, occupying more than 100 buildings. In Khmer Rouge occupied the town of Tarn Tu from 3 June, using the UN building as a front. Then, the PRG moved from Hanoi to Phnom Penh. On 31 April the attacks happened. The UN went into action in Khmer Rouge attack groups. More than 2,300 people were killed or wounded. At least 80 civilians were killed. On 30 March the group entered Trilong province of Thracia, attacking the city of Phnom Penh. On 6 May the group returned to the town and attack at the PRG, then a base. At the end of the year, in early June, the regime of Gen. Thrasher N. Pham left the town of Phnom Penh and fled, following a decision to stay in the country.\n\nTrial in Cambodia on 10 September 1989\n\nThe trial began against the late Nol and of 16 members of his entourage, then released on 17 September 1989.

The total defense for the regular season thus far hasn\u2019t been anything close to what it was during the regular season, but the @- isn\u2019t exactly one of those teams that has put up big numbers against any of the teams listed above.\n\nThe only team that has won more in a game against a teams last home game this season is San Diego State in the 2019 Big 12 Tournament \u2014 and that win was their lowest total away from home in eight years.

Boston is the only team from the Big East to win at least 40 percent of its home games, and the @- was the only team with a combined win percentage of less than 40 percent in eight of their 10 games this preseason.\n\nThe Celtics are tied for first in the NET and 10th in the Conference \u2014 so this win over Boston may actually have been a good thing to show the @- that they\u2019ve finally won it in front of their own home crowd.","token_len":472,"entropy":[10.0879,10.6073,3.3775,8.0893,4.5062,0.1256,0.8204,2.2586,1.0894,0.4181,0.9201,4.6663,0.5056,4.5966,0.0283,1.0107,1.8129,7.2437,0.7502,2.1971,0.1159,0.9952,7.1076,0.0037,1.5376,1.1717,3.7204,3.25,4.3598,15.33,7.9168,6.9625,1.7994,10.0025,0.123,2.5809,0.5563,4.5879,1.9668,1.8162,2.3166,0.7076,3.8504,0.0017,4.762,3.3414,0.2478,2.4101,1.6494,4.3724,0.4314,2.1267,3.8225,0.0024,0.0003,0.9291,1.8468,6.814,10.8036,7.1994,6.5332,0.9151,4.4454,1.8557,3.2252,3.6156,5.7743,3.724,0.075,0.5496,1.1004,4.456,1.0075,6.3055,3.2039,2.1972,3.0168,1.1731,5.3794,1.2957,4.8135,5.5351,1.6225,2.9762,1.4075,4.2867,0.0661,0.8153,3.3953,1.4595,1.5956,7.1339,3.2815,4.518,0.7454,4.2913,0.0219,7.0372,0.1283,6.2267,16.4123,8.409,1.7438,0.88,5.0108,1.537,0.2719,2.0454,1.1721,0.5535,2.729,0.3349,0.4988,0.0075,1.238,1.0824,1.7682,2.8355,0.4792,5.8457,2.1895,1.8566,0.0334,3.873,5.1647,1.2541,1.3713,1.1717,2.0326,1.7433,5.3131,0.1703,4.1763,0.288,2.8549,5.2704,2.1421,0.5854,2.3929,3.3991,1.092,0.3229,1.1287,0.0034,1.8258,4.022,2.0385,0.9711,0.8242,4.1426,2.6031,3.7745,1.3587,1.8943,2.362,2.0057,6.4589,7.8385,6.3029,0.9685,4.4355,0.2256,1.6065,4.6938,1.3182,1.2422,3.9664,1.1923,10.2598,3.4028,0.573,2.622,6.2892,1.6807,1.518,5.7636,1.3075,4.5156,5.805,1.5776,8.5989,0.4146,0.0884,1.6812,4.7136,1.1916,0.4164,1.7694,1.7955,0.1852,2.1288,4.2004,5.963,0.1507,1.0815,0.312,12.5754,3.9395,2.7642,2.9588,0.2378,2.703,0.4613,0.3239,2.4998,1.5181,1.6763,6.696,5.3888,1.7176,0.6991,4.111,2.1046,1.1066,2.2462,1.2976,0.7506,0.1502,0.6918,2.7148,0.9016,6.4629,0.0035,5.5603,0.591,0.7508,0.1624,2.5636,0.0392,0.7993,1.2413,5.3274,4.8128,0.6264,3.0181,3.1681,0.6617,0.1183,7.0986,0.2179,0.339,0.7794,0.0002,4.7485,5.3799,5.6035,8.2514,0.6558,0.3479,4.4273,2.9124,1.5694,1.0853,0.1066,0.539,1.2851,0.9096,0.0335,5.1792,1.7938,0.7406,8.6106,8.8966,4.7625,4.0353,3.8074,3.0387,3.5325,0.6395,4.1626,0.0039,3.4041,0.9103,0.3868,0.2216,1.3846,2.4734,1.7613,2.9404,4.6981,1.2619,0.8979,2.4827,4.2025,0.5811,0.0208,1.2036,0.7573,0.808,0.052,1.0653,3.11,3.1135,4.1501,2.005,1.452,1.2005,0.4773,4.7708,0.3632,1.3187,1.6286,2.3002,5.422,8.496,0.2514,0.0557,3.9657,3.681,3.0731,1.5744,1.5868,0.2553,1.7326,4.6,3.053,5.4679,1.0265,2.4629,2.286,4.2969,0.4398,0.8977,1.0356,0.0002,1.596,6.072,5.7351,0.2349,11.0837,2.6088,1.2013,5.5249,3.2429,4.2406,1.8238,2.6116,1.9233,1.5977,1.2127,0.0579,2.1153,2.8004,1.2971,3.2997,1.2503,4.9701,1.6522,1.2735,0.1556,5.5846,4.8463,0.357,0.7875,1.063,4.1002,1.2463,3.7526,5.9502,8.0245,1.245,0.9104,3.1069,5.0569,1.5942,1.8498,1.3375,4.8057,7.0741,1.7792,1.1219,0.8278,0.7248,2.8932,2.1834,2.7975,0.3987,0.1957,5.3154,0.6315,1.8021,4.1513,1.5418,2.9944,1.9957,0.0445,4.7705,1.193,0.0828,0.606,4.4098,0.2568,2.5019,0.8234,1.9472,2.4136,0.076,3.9411,1.1919,0.3095,0.2662,4.3089,1.2039,5.3457,4.233,0.6733,0.8119,2.5303,0.0074,2.6191,0.1485,1.8344,5.545,0.4758,1.5027,3.6294,0.8318,2.1815,2.7721,0.1345,0.804,0.0002,1.4343,1.9956,1.6714,4.1319,0.1467,2.8721,0.7914,0.1344,2.5504,1.0271,4.6101,0.2449,0.2318,0.063,4.2018,4.4786,3.6655,2.922,3.8774,4.4953,1.7822,4.0237,4.371,3.0709,1.0301,1.7247,3.4564,2.1891,4.208,5.7198,2.7545,1.2003,0.0604,2.176,0.7467,4.4624,0.2034,3.2193,4.7895,3.6773,4.2069,3.4651,4.5114,0.0114,1.1741,2.5096,3.2527,0.6103,0.3257]}

{"id":1830,"ended":true,"length":404,"text":"Until the Whole World Hears met with an overall mixed to positive response from critics. Several critics regarded the musical aspects of the album as mediocre or sub @ - @ par, while others have praised the band's new album as an album of a much stronger future.\n\nIn a letter to the audience, composer\/writer Tony Vigori-Sargent wrote, 'I am convinced that there are no fewer than seventeen versions of the album available for streaming. The three different interpretations will be made, one of which is the single 'Necessary' (in Greek, if I may use it correctly). The second one is a rework of two songs from the original 'Necessary' album but the other one is the album's third one 'Necessary'. These two songs are different versions of one song - there was no vocal replacement for 'Necessary' during the compilation effort. This final one, which is 'Necessary', shows that we can do both, both 'Necessary' and 'Necessary'. There is no need to do two versions of these songs for a complete album. Both of them, therefore, work for the purpose of making it much, much better.'\n\nThe band will release their upcoming album 'Hear' in February 2016 as well as their first album 'Bread'. In a press release, the band explained the process behind their second album 'Hear'. In both cases, the band will open their set with a new lyric song for each of the band's songs.

{"id":2721,"ended":false,"length":444,"text":"After quitting the newspaper in 1923, Douglas worked as a freelance writer. From 1920 to 1990, Douglas published 109 fiction articles and stories. One of her first stories was sold to the American publisher, The Washington Post, where she died in 1935. Douglas had an extensive career as a newspaper writer, having written for a number of publications such as The New York Times, The Washington Tribune, and New York Magazine (which had an annual circulation of nearly 70,000 ). Douglas was the American editor for the magazine from 1921, until she retired in 1931. Douglas married Henry M. Douglas, a lawyer and academic, in 1925, and they had four children, whom they named William, Elizabeth, and Mary (one was Charles Douglas, the son of William and Mary and the other was Mary who was born in 1923). Douglas then moved to New York City, and after her son was born in 1928, Douglas joined the publishing company, New York City News, where she was Vice President, Political Editor and President of the New York City Journal. She was also the editor of New York Magazine during the years 1930 and 1934. On February 5, 1932 Douglas left New York City and returned to Connecticut for her second and third stint in the company.\n\nAs an editor\nEdison Publishing Company\n\nDouglas is credited as the first female editor in publication in 1935. She was the first editor of New York Magazine before it was destroyed in the Great Depression. During her time with the magazine and its publisher Arthur Schutzmann (then known as Edward Schutzmann), many of the other editors would serve as the executive editor. At the time that Douglas was the founder of a publishing company, her first book was called The Complete Works of William Haggis, and she published this in 1936.\n\nDouglas left the publishing company in 1936 and returned to Connecticut with the book. She left the Connecticut company as well as the publisher Arthur Schutzmann. After the return to Connecticut with the book, Douglas had another book, the Novels of Virginia, which was published in 1940.\n\nDouglas and Schutzmann married in 1957 and they had two sons, William and Joseph. In 1956, they were allowed to start an operation during the financial crisis, called the Douglas Project.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Edison Publishing Company's website","token_len":473,"entropy":[10.627,1.7724,7.7778,2.2242,8.3681,0.2279,7.478,5.9752,1.1741,0.2675,4.4941,1.4392,2.5064,5.3954,3.9235,0.5053,8.5428,0.309,2.2594,3.7246,9.6906,6.0708,3.9556,1.9023,4.4417,1.4932,4.833,0.2829,6.1345,1.8535,2.5935,1.2118,8.5464,0.7945,1.6787,3.4798,4.1277,2.2715,2.8727,3.9625,0.151,0.8931,3.1623,0.8795,4.9143,0.314,6.5401,0.1456,2.3321,3.3872,3.4532,2.4689,2.4696,1.4112,0.2761,3.4954,2.3462,0.8722,4.4206,2.3291,1.5661,3.8452,0.7486,0.0011,3.0679,4.6346,0.0022,1.3396,0.6543,0.1556,0.2192,0.3449,0.6466,1.9225,7.1923,0.2924,1.1927,4.4591,0.254,2.2619,4.7582,3.466,2.9269,3.857,3.0496,0.4559,0.034,3.5849,4.9561,0.1198,0.0032,7.9777,2.4009,1.8833,2.9763,6.6386,1.9241,4.048,1.5271,4.8569,3.6988,3.8752,5.822,1.331,1.4326,2.0943,0.519,4.0805,0.4629,2.2584,5.4433,5.989,3.8283,0.1838,2.8052,1.1216,2.2728,4.8534,1.2243,6.7984,0.8461,0.5447,3.9128,1.7037,0.5489,1.4837,0.9536,2.0899,0.0649,1.7406,7.2192,1.453,0.782,4.7867,1.3936,3.9822,0.3071,1.5229,3.2301,2.2536,4.845,5.0113,6.5831,3.3827,1.1545,2.8142,3.045,0.0628,3.0187,2.351,0.6486,4.7326,1.6707,0.2299,0.7434,2.93,7.7843,1.7385,0.7479,0.4156,4.7295,0.7113,1.9538,5.6314,1.7177,0.3405,1.5836,0.1124,0.8525,1.5196,3.5598,4.2085,2.2578,5.3801,2.1066,0.2508,0.9124,2.9409,0.1868,2.2685,5.2081,0.6294,4.8919,2.4084,1.8843,4.2651,0.7934,3.2255,3.7108,1.2739,1.5935,0.0633,2.7866,5.6874,0.4176,1.4621,6.3334,2.0811,1.8395,3.8861,0.6622,0.5192,1.8237,0.046,2.7625,3.9651,0.696,1.5738,1.5714,1.8805,1.7882,1.3606,0.404,4.1397,0.1493,1.6423,4.8053,0.6951,3.8636,4.0495,2.489,3.0849,0.6564,4.6677,2.7838,3.2216,0.0551,3.9244,4.6731,4.0592,1.7855,0.0021,0.9376,1.6615,3.1216,0.0477,5.3015,2.8355,1.6859,2.5731,3.6943,1.5359,5.1431,3.2901,0.9857,5.3731,0.5856,2.2358,0.0336,5.05,2.7788,1.4603,6.0769,21.5288,3.8887,5.0465,0.9314,2.0562,0.0003,3.5541,0.0006,3.5044,2.9313,1.5861,1.3235,1.7083,3.7577,0.6508,1.7079,7.1558,3.2193,7.9854,0.8449,1.2863,1.0529,1.5803,0.7472,2.8358,1.7809,2.5348,0.04,1.9844,5.1045,3.3581,0.639,5.6885,0.7948,2.2784,1.6198,0.0102,0.731,3.7001,1.0159,1.5441,2.5478,0.5852,0.4713,4.8893,2.9717,2.5983,6.8824,3.2958,10.5897,5.5272,2.9647,5.8497,2.8663,0.0358,7.0526,2.1792,0.2305,0.1061,0.8808,6.067,0.7671,1.0094,4.7799,2.5148,5.4111,5.2596,0.496,2.8739,5.2128,2.1406,1.2739,4.5103,1.0131,0.7447,5.1864,2.6868,0.9904,2.4456,5.9283,0.5851,4.8912,2.0009,0.4297,1.0859,3.5103,1.9616,2.5114,0.9014,3.4029,1.6196,5.6671,2.8757,0.1394,3.5943,3.506,8.0219,3.1589,1.2142,2.0034,1.434,3.0379,4.7461,3.9494,2.45,0.3726,2.0667,0.0002,1.7616,0.0001,4.2337,1.5239,3.153,0.264,0.6946,2.9862,1.4492,1.6112,0.0268,1.1908,3.9321,2.6485,4.3976,1.6812,1.3625,3.5547,0.9302,4.8756,2.7679,4.1433,3.5974,1.8452,1.3265,2.9078,2.7117,0.0606,0.0033,0.0129,2.6689,3.347,2.2277,5.7993,1.4658,1.3651,5.0698,0.5162,0.0875,0.2503,1.3991,4.3916,3.2844,1.8542,1.7453,4.117,7.8161,1.8919,0.4292,6.599,3.3697,1.8203,1.0137,0.4669,0.4336,3.4846,0.4953,1.8756,0.0001,1.7259,0.0001,3.9507,2.0582,0.0017,0.0056,4.587,0.3374,5.2259,2.0733,2.7444,1.1112,1.5505,1.7377,0.6398,2.1596,0.9324,4.2017,1.1477,2.745,5.0963,0.5457,2.5377,2.9847,6.9301,0.1373,4.7856,4.0871,3.4756,8.2889,1.2654,5.5302,0.2523,1.7718,4.2485,1.4398,5.6116,6.5235,0.9144,1.9166,0.0002,6.9005,0.8181,0.0003,7.0548,0.6341,0.7655,25.7825,0.6859,0.1516,5.5781,1.9828]}
{"id":2125,"ended":false,"length":401,"text":"Between 1860 and 1863 Busch wrote over one hundred articles for the M\u00fcnchener Bilderbogen and < unk > Bl\u00e4tter, but he felt his dependence on publisher Kaspar Braun had become constricting. Busch appointed Johann Franz Pabert, then a German novelist, to write a paper about \"The Social Scene of Modern Germany, from its beginnings\", and was also in charge of the Schloss in Hamburg through 1860. Busch did not see any new \"social\" issues outside the city. By 1861, he had a reputation for speaking German, and though the Germans would make no attempt to assimilate to his philosophy, and that of other European writers and thinkers, Busch's influence spread even further.\n\n Busch grew up in Weltland, but had to learn about it in a relatively private way. He read to his parents, telling them that he would be \"always at home\" visiting them in their homes. \"He was a teacher,\" B\u00fcndchen told him. \"He is always thinking that we will always have our own school, our own community, our own church. He also wants his name to be pronounced as 'Busch' because 'Busch' is only a synonyme and 'Busch' is a mononym.\" To Busch, the B\u00fcndchen nickname \"Busch is a Busch\" was as meaningful as the name Busch.\n\nDuring 1864, Busch wrote a book called \"Informal History of Modern Germany and its Early Revolution\" featuring a few hundred stories of historical and political events, many of which he found very interesting. Busch was the first to produce that book, and in 1880 a special pamphlet was circulated by the B\u00fcndchen Academy of German Studies. The book was published in 1881.\n\nBusch died in 1896, but was succeeded by his two sons, Heinrich F\u00fcnster Busch and Dietrich Busch. Busch died in 1903 at Cologne.\n\nHe was well respected by the city for the work he had done, and a number of his articles appeared in the journal Zolt\u00e1nz (1900). In 1884 Busch published in the \"Gesetz der Welt\" a series of articles about history, politics, literature and history.\n\nReferences","token_len":473,"entropy":[11.7978,0.4142,3.3008,12.7538,0.889,4.4267,6.853,4.3343,0.3846,2.3174,2.3399,1.0199,11.3326,0.4825,0.6934,7.1227,5.8335,5.7243,8.4217,2.8463,12.1742,11.6131,4.9317,7.851,7.8551,3.3049,2.3868,1.2741,3.0209,4.4488,2.1051,5.9642,3.9402,8.6621,0.2904,8.6156,7.7597,1.68,8.9575,3.6234,2.7268,8.1178,0.6446,0.5493,3.6063,0.0027,9.1044,7.0031,5.4242,5.764,5.7254,7.4396,1.5404,4.2072,1.581,3.3003,6.1659,0.4967,1.0419,2.1412,1.4852,5.5766,2.7319,4.5735,3.0009,4.977,6.8848,1.8129,4.5118,1.4512,3.244,3.8306,3.4013,3.2176,6.0502,1.5453,4.4291,4.2735,4.4764,2.893,0.0201,1.2248,7.3248,3.2782,5.4932,3.2754,8.4801,4.6637,0.4332,2.8294,0.0022,4.3879,0.3407,3.7844,2.7158,6.0586,5.3205,2.1396,2.8235,4.3186,6.2711,1.3285,5.0332,1.9855,5.1387,3.6966,1.2552,1.4839,1.24,3.8144,4.2267,0.6081,7.1081,4.3544,1.5288,1.3246,6.0381,3.1193,4.7605,4.2949,5.4449,2.8956,1.6926,0.0807,4.0103,0.0005,3.3041,1.8275,5.8699,0.4351,5.1677,5.0784,2.2634,3.246,3.3305,1.6897,3.8722,1.6925,0.4805,1.7854,0.0019,1.9877,2.8554,5.2942,5.3747,0.8307,0.7095,4.6441,23.9345,0.0018,6.592,1.7173,0.451,5.6161,5.9869,5.6186,0.6221,4.3725,3.9378,3.2854,4.2628,4.9819,4.8272,2.325,3.0479,5.3347,4.4692,1.24,0.7275,1.2363,4.5707,4.5036,2.0449,2.6323,2.1041,7.9067,0.1904,1.8491,1.1695,3.0703,2.2445,3.1856,4.6023,3.5669,1.1075,1.6305,6.5571,3.743,2.4728,2.8116,3.5434,1.2375,3.9343,3.9939,1.7776,2.359,5.1416,1.9803,6.3379,2.1202,2.1161,0.8441,2.5702,2.6701,0.8844,0.5762,0.8574,5.153,2.3873,5.4469,6.0446,3.3004,3.7917,2.9221,1.6115,3.4244,1.0355,4.3374,1.3841,2.5068,0.0899,4.0787,0.5679,0.5223,0.0158,4.2637,1.9192,1.3376,4.8777,4.9894,4.4741,6.5499,0.7036,0.5882,6.0682,2.6582,1.4301,3.2546,0.0328,2.2804,2.6292,3.9155,0.524,0.0917,0.3683,1.2933,5.4064,1.7644,5.8862,8.0423,5.5517,3.7703,3.6567,0.3754,0.0558,0.1841,0.6082,1.5085,6.143,2.901,1.7543,5.5781,3.0556,0.0028,0.7378,1.564,7.4571,0.3049,0.003,0.0011,6.6039,2.5211,1.0813,0.0512,5.5342,2.1961,8.1687,0.1102,0.7856,0.8962,5.3218,5.4351,0.6448,1.2104,2.0752,3.8135,0.1027,2.4231,3.9648,0.1588,5.1094,4.2197,1.1072,1.232,0.7046,0.0015,2.8338,1.4053,2.2815,1.8798,0.8905,4.5089,5.3773,0.671,3.6556,0.6468,3.102,0.455,4.2646,2.2988,5.7462,5.6984,1.7415,6.858,1.8308,4.6278,4.9071,5.0107,2.2035,5.0487,2.3468,1.5755,1.561,2.0949,4.1967,0.3296,0.257,1.9463,4.237,3.8288,1.1937,0.3632,2.8432,0.0021,2.4898,3.8232,0.8052,1.0312,5.6779,6.3453,0.7126,0.8063,0.9725,3.041,5.747,4.2164,4.7568,5.2539,0.8328,4.2464,1.8378,0.7348,3.7326,0.1954,0.0032,0.0004,5.709,1.7728,3.3727,1.4163,1.4448,1.744,2.7535,1.2289,2.5314,0.7759,1.26,1.9188,1.8938,2.5023,0.0003,1.9901,0.0011,4.2291,0.557,4.5935,1.2723,1.567,3.415,2.8501,0.1812,1.4886,4.4948,0.8669,0.6285,3.1382,0.1325,6.7505,1.915,1.6183,2.4625,2.878,0.0047,0.4317,4.9614,0.2599,1.8132,0.0032,0.6603,3.0457,0.002,2.3088,0.6324,3.7638,1.4093,8.2849,1.617,1.3226,0.0003,4.3659,1.5864,5.181,4.2867,1.744,1.3845,3.7305,4.1904,4.2014,2.3749,0.2295,3.6914,0.0691,2.03,0.8974,4.282,3.8788,0.0023,2.0724,3.9311,3.3048,0.193,1.1655,6.0095,5.788,5.2264,2.151,5.2939,3.3844,5.4171,0.7887,2.4501,2.443,3.1989,2.4423,0.0026,1.4799,4.4541,1.596,3.714,4.803,2.0822,2.7087,3.1122,3.0658,0.584,1.0588,1.9386,3.1866,0.024,1.6783,1.9849,6.5947,1.3625,2.4058,0.4234,3.0454,1.2224,4.4473,1.232,2.3331,0.0002,6.7523]}

To add further depth, the Australians, who had been reduced to four men after a long battle with an alien, led a double force attack, while the Australians came from above their enemy-filled targets.\n\nAfter a short period of fighting, they secured their positions with the capture of the American headquarters and forced the Americans to fire their weapons, allowing them to hold the outpost at Fort Bragg for a period of three days. The US forces deployed in support of the French invasion were awarded the rank of Major.\n\nOn the 9th November 2010, the Australians became only the second nation in history to receive General MacArthur as its military leader to command a United States military force in his 50 year service. The last U.S. General MacArthur to command a force in his final months was General Abraham Lincoln, in 1914.\n\nIn August 2001, the U.S. Air Force, in addition to training its troops in South Africa and Afghanistan, sent forces to Iraq and Afghanistan where they were deployed in support of President Bush\u2019s efforts to end the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. The Air Force was the third largest military force in history.\n\nFollowing the 9\/11 terrorist attacks, more than 300 Australian troops, including 10 British soldiers and 11 American citizens, were evacuated to South Africa. Australia was the first of its kind to visit South Africa. The Australian soldiers were stationed in Zanzibar, which had been overrun by the Islamic State (IS) terrorists and taken over by the Japanese-led Allied forces.\n\nSince its formation in 1988, the Australian military has worked closely with the State Department.

According to the first, told by the Lennons, on 9 November 1966 Lennon went to the Indica Gallery in London, where Ono was present. Lennon, who had been a member of the British rock band The Beatles, said, \"A huge rock concert, and they made me look up to him, and, if they'd only seen \"A New Way To Live\" for an advert, they would never have asked me to play. And after a year, Lennon finally accepted me, and told me I'd be a good drummer.\"\nLennon, along with his mate and friend Eddie McGuire, played two shows for the band's legendary London club, The Waverley School of The Rock in April and June 1967. Lennon played on the band's four albums, '60s rock - 1971 and 1974 - and was responsible for the '70s' and '80s' chart-topping singles 'Serenity', 'I Feel Better' in 1975, 'The Best Of The Beatles', 'We Were Never Together', 'Who Do You Think You Are?,' and 'In the End', and for his final solo, \"Honey, They Are\", and for a number of hits as a cover band.\n\nLennon was the manager of the band in many ways, including as a producer and producer. Lennon was known for his commitment to creative design and writing, including his writing style as being a \"pluralist\" of the Beatles. During his working life, Lennon wrote songs such as \"It' - which featured his sister on the track - and the \"Letters\" - which was the band's first hit record. Lennon also produced and recorded the music video for the song \"One More Minute\".\n\nHe had also worked at The White Room, producing music for films including the 1980 film Love is Strange. He also recorded the music for the 1998 film \"The Last Minute\" and was also credited with recording the soundtrack to the film.\n\nIn 1974, Ono died unexpectedly at the age of 85. A second death confirmed his passing. Ono's death was due to complications from cancer.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nThe Official website of the Beatles\n Official Website of the Beatles\nOfficial site of the Beatles","token_len":474,"entropy":[8.645,5.7665,5.2104,4.8638,11.4317,4.7736,9.1749,2.2289,1.0019,3.691,0.0004,1.6939,4.2449,1.0262,9.4961,1.4737,3.1235,10.6909,5.6466,1.1724,3.4855,4.9965,2.7173,2.8388,2.6639,3.8659,0.3345,1.6645,10.8122,4.8748,6.8804,0.9072,1.8554,2.0654,1.061,2.4382,0.0028,1.3287,3.9096,1.0112,1.8774,3.0455,1.2945,1.2939,1.3967,3.2358,2.5417,0.0768,0.7476,3.6558,4.142,0.6602,1.7712,1.374,0.6398,4.088,3.2642,0.204,5.3424,5.803,5.4384,2.9181,3.2381,2.6639,3.7171,5.2217,1.1339,3.2907,5.1252,1.084,3.7291,2.1194,0.7087,6.2221,4.5813,3.0086,2.5719,3.9052,3.0429,7.9522,4.3417,3.928,5.6947,3.7886,0.7126,1.4841,4.3539,5.3102,7.116,0.7513,1.4718,1.1299,3.8139,0.1033,3.1783,0.4038,0.5509,2.722,3.1702,3.1112,5.9109,2.6088,3.8581,1.5612,5.1959,4.8836,3.2526,2.7711,2.1972,0.776,3.7055,0.0963,2.5525,2.3008,1.7243,2.1204,1.7439,4.2797,1.7322,1.5765,10.2974,0.0023,0.1045,2.5874,5.3916,0.0011,2.2003,5.8128,3.5192,1.8269,5.2989,5.003,0.4361,0.1869,2.9712,5.0052,2.3198,2.9049,1.0796,2.1678,3.3796,5.9366,4.5745,4.1079,1.4675,1.7509,6.3625,2.8687,0.2106,6.7696,2.5767,6.9604,4.8948,3.354,3.789,2.5957,2.3919,1.0902,0.3323,2.6961,3.7501,3.2574,1.1612,3.696,0.0514,5.954,3.6029,1.0035,4.6635,5.4352,0.1002,2.3276,6.5907,7.9038,2.8318,4.8728,0.8149,0.8878,2.9622,6.9902,0.0242,1.3739,4.3273,2.024,0.0121,5.6075,3.4197,0.0752,0.0363,0.002,4.8153,6.6184,2.0369,0.0153,2.2673,2.7814,0.9364,4.443,6.2288,1.4413,1.4166,0.1627,3.4368,3.82,4.3266,1.4173,7.9947,3.6014,1.3913,0.3653,2.9765,4.9802,1.3086,2.5894,2.288,1.7192,0.4686,4.8189,2.8627,3.0479,2.4959,1.2917,0.5074,5.584,2.6479,0.3193,1.1499,0.0363,0.0153,3.0196,5.1351,0.8615,0.3497,5.0959,3.5741,3.1321,2.574,2.6371,4.4467,2.3736,4.7145,2.8281,3.4252,3.998,5.0904,2.62,2.065,7.3523,3.4786,7.7974,5.3997,1.3467,3.106,3.2173,0.0311,5.3202,4.4985,1.678,5.1282,2.1055,2.251,1.0858,8.2383,2.0842,0.0026,0.0011,1.9448,3.1224,4.8454,0.3056,0.9425,2.7528,3.8407,6.8506,1.4626,1.0416,1.7085,3.2781,1.3144,2.9751,1.5169,2.6091,4.0585,3.4714,2.0024,3.289,0.6758,0.8372,6.2038,0.168,5.4567,5.9574,1.0577,5.289,0.8446,4.5881,2.0104,5.4572,4.0285,2.8932,6.2826,2.7715,2.2743,5.7428,3.9863,0.755,1.5355,2.888,1.8634,3.9232,1.2459,4.4911,1.2991,5.3738,1.1287,0.4007,0.7419,2.8656,2.3735,3.3784,0.0021,1.9225,4.4736,6.9231,5.6611,4.8157,4.3438,3.9722,5.6137,3.9857,1.3671,4.2418,1.2183,0.7939,2.991,4.2282,5.4259,4.5445,2.4169,2.591,0.4927,3.5459,3.0353,3.6124,0.0618,1.5911,3.33,5.1581,0.657,2.2766,1.1589,3.6511,2.7031,2.1619,2.1411,3.4772,4.6603,0.1338,1.4233,2.8697,1.2873,5.3102,1.3464,5.3228,1.2551,0.8148,0.0002,3.6562,3.274,2.6047,1.5898,3.524,2.9515,5.3237,4.5522,1.3293,7.4011,3.1101,0.5307,5.368,2.1384,2.7757,5.2135,0.8931,5.2751,4.4508,2.5914,2.183,1.9182,1.3317,3.2015,1.8887,2.0276,1.5564,1.0055,5.98,0.9327,2.9967,2.0941,4.0999,8.1324,1.5751,1.0998,2.83,2.3865,3.5002,0.7143,3.7074,0.8004,2.3524,1.2802,0.829,2.1401,1.6849,0.8234,0.0002,2.0591,4.7587,0.4483,3.6733,0.0047,2.1689,4.7949,0.9517,0.6055,0.0316,0.0011,4.3285,0.8238,4.2211,5.677,4.4094,6.1752,1.6454,3.6293,1.2815,2.0635,0.0242,1.1311,2.5904,0.9833,5.9204,0.0704,2.1934,0.8154,1.8654,0.9057,1.1109,0.0003,6.4374,1.198,0.0004,5.7406,0.4236,0.8988,16.1198,4.628,5.2935,0.6125,0.8507,2.9784,2.1274,21.6468,3.6788,0.4367,0.5664,0.7734,0.9096,21.514,3.2685,0.0664,0.5783,1.6658]}

{"id":1921,"ended":true,"length":451,"text":"Since Islais Creek is a culvert that carries storm water, domestic sewage, and industrial wastewater, it is possible for the sewage to overflow. Such overflow can cause a public health hazard, and can add significant costs to the local economy.\nThe water can accumulate in the sewer system and water storage systems, and is a hazardous chemical product that can lead to chemical leakages and health issues. It may have a tendency to be corrosive and can drain the water into other nearby sewer system systems.\nThe water may also drain from the power plant and water storage systems. The problem with this type of situation is that municipal water tanks and water storage systems run at high temperature. This also creates a potential for contamination from chemicals and harmful bacteria that have had the opposite effect because the chemical process is inefficient.\nWhen not working with the water system you can see that the sewer system is flooded with the sewage water. The water also comes in contact with buildings and places where there are many people living.\nIt is important to do your best to use caution with your water due to increased sewage water use. When you drink too much water, the excess water gets into the sewer or water storage system which can cause some problems.\nWash your hands before drinking the water, as it can be contaminated with chemicals or bacteria.\nUse a washcloth or wipe as well as cleaning shoes.\nBaking your own bread is important because you don\u2019t want to get any mold or germs on your kitchen table. You will also get bacteria on your stovetop when you do this. You can buy baked goods which can cause the problem to spread quickly. When cooking, soak a food processor by pressing the counter until it comes in flat and then by the end of the cook time take the food out of the dishwasher.\nIt is important to make your own bread with some extra ingredients, such as oil, flour, salt and sugar. These ingredients can be very difficult to prepare using an oil based bread baking dish.\nAnother important thing to consider now is to find a way to cleanse yourself. Your body will do all the washing once it is clean and you no longer need to. In general, it is better to start with a fresh cleaning solution to cleanse yourself before taking some new recipes which would make it easier to cleanse yourself.","token_len":475,"entropy":[9.0381,3.6533,6.0455,9.6328,2.3205,2.0342,7.9284,2.277,1.9857,5.4477,8.2343,1.2925,3.0354,10.2964,2.9334,0.9264,0.82,4.7141,2.0868,3.0594,3.5159,1.436,5.4372,2.6063,1.725,5.5419,0.559,3.8481,2.3019,6.3585,1.8034,1.9662,1.2433,2.718,6.1952,0.5162,1.5558,1.4685,2.0609,3.7749,6.0094,4.502,2.5766,0.4534,0.8217,2.0674,0.4512,0.2997,0.8457,12.6976,4.1914,4.2489,5.3243,0.5345,1.0875,4.9246,0.9517,1.3739,5.5194,6.0418,2.6754,1.1265,1.9314,3.3036,3.2567,4.7283,3.8562,6.5916,1.5961,0.959,3.4026,0.0147,4.9345,5.5706,0.4435,1.3662,3.6152,2.107,0.3864,3.7404,3.8627,4.4237,1.5298,5.462,0.04,4.1778,3.9553,0.0003,1.815,2.4915,7.9334,2.389,2.3106,3.0637,3.5345,4.6485,4.2624,4.234,2.0739,0.4393,0.758,1.9435,3.1086,3.1295,0.8927,5.6874,2.813,1.3582,4.9264,1.6991,1.8624,4.2594,2.4533,0.6102,1.0977,2.3663,4.6259,1.9829,1.354,2.524,0.0037,5.4335,0.1278,0.164,7.2893,1.0762,6.9833,2.305,3.4858,2.1717,0.6691,5.4472,1.8444,2.2987,5.9779,2.148,2.0468,4.4668,2.7659,0.7098,2.6769,1.3031,2.1398,2.6053,5.0765,1.7018,5.1625,2.9447,1.933,4.3527,7.1433,3.5977,7.0504,0.1849,6.8312,1.8587,5.1769,5.493,1.514,4.2867,0.6375,0.6114,4.2584,6.7045,4.9431,2.2006,2.0306,2.1052,2.2108,6.6894,1.5588,4.0189,2.2993,1.1106,3.6953,0.907,1.0075,5.2189,1.3096,3.723,2.2213,3.0393,1.0104,1.933,1.9047,4.0038,4.0658,1.8776,1.6096,0.0047,5.5467,0.9373,6.9238,1.5811,2.6347,1.1693,4.1738,2.0361,1.1957,1.335,1.3544,4.0748,0.4592,1.3031,0.2063,5.0675,0.7149,1.6714,0.0799,5.049,5.0762,4.1531,1.7464,1.4869,7.9467,0.0141,5.9475,4.3443,4.2787,2.9496,0.703,3.9086,1.6428,5.3491,3.6219,0.0347,0.9892,1.519,2.0476,4.4265,1.0444,4.6007,0.5895,0.7964,1.9623,6.6404,2.7151,0.2009,0.7645,4.2014,1.0334,1.1831,4.9944,2.3709,0.5302,0.8974,5.3826,2.791,1.6074,0.2541,2.5018,2.5129,3.5047,0.3512,2.3229,2.7491,1.8688,1.0148,2.6788,3.4913,0.7951,2.6159,3.5845,1.7342,0.4553,1.4596,3.8958,1.4283,4.4247,0.6397,1.4124,4.6906,6.7056,2.6126,0.7572,6.532,5.7318,2.2079,0.82,6.0446,4.615,4.8146,1.7295,2.2747,2.1011,3.3988,3.0452,3.3332,4.5019,15.259,8.0241,1.1351,0.256,0.726,3.3662,3.1844,4.7417,1.2908,3.3954,0.0088,2.1629,0.5891,4.4483,2.1202,0.6955,3.2674,2.8804,1.423,4.6027,2.808,1.6129,0.466,5.2866,1.6012,3.5418,0.7784,3.8499,1.3286,0.3569,3.6457,1.442,4.9449,5.5015,0.2058,4.5059,2.1437,3.8174,3.2735,2.5594,4.0865,2.4444,4.3951,0.5996,5.3027,4.2388,1.7393,5.37,3.4169,4.5932,2.0011,6.4727,4.264,1.698,5.8197,5.1981,0.8379,3.2695,4.2893,11.9737,2.241,1.312,5.9384,5.4587,2.1088,0.0902,0.2371,4.1405,0.6014,6.9908,1.8995,0.9116,2.5451,1.1915,0.13,3.1829,0.5557,0.8571,0.805,4.1307,0.3501,1.0239,0.1693,3.0563,3.4639,0.2065,0.984,3.4994,4.1606,5.0117,2.7884,2.3109,1.3651,0.0063,5.3333,1.008,1.3426,0.1713,1.7866,1.4901,3.3758,0.3595,4.2338,2.1044,1.0266,1.2891,4.1758,2.6844,0.0452,2.8415,4.0085,4.439,2.7805,1.8692,1.4044,4.8003,2.7124,0.5774,0.8828,5.4609,1.942,1.4511,0.4539,2.6956,8.5767,0.1549,1.7249,5.2544,1.1987,3.5222,0.0804,3.844,5.6077,3.1335,2.8615,4.6425,2.3736,2.0634,4.2688,2.7054,0.7485,2.6485,6.2179,1.184,1.5514,3.3585,2.0055,2.6464,6.1579,0.0103,1.1703,0.3611,5.5702,4.4493,4.1042,0.9979,2.3842,0.4253,1.748,0.1096,4.8567,1.2962,1.1321,3.1483,5.233,2.5303,3.6894,2.1515,1.1468,0.8336,2.3304,4.1137,4.9116,5.1029,6.2507,5.841,5.4416,2.8288,1.9234,0.7534,0.5087,1.3607,0.3034,0.4763,0.3968]}
{"id":4556,"ended":false,"length":422,"text":"The Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem was passed in 1999, choosing both the Hinomaru and Kimigayo as Japan's national symbols. The passage of the law stemmed from a suicide by the Japanese authorities in the city of Yokohama in the middle of the Second World War. It was passed as a final act by President Akio Kono-kun, following the end of WWII. It was passed in 2002  after an opposition vote. The law was amended with a ruling by the Supreme Court of Japan in 1992, which said the law would make \"the recognition of and support for the national and Japanese flag and national anthem of Japan \" \" \" and that it is compatible with the Japanese Constitution\". The law was also amended to prohibit discrimination against Japan in certain events. In 1994, as a result of the Japanese people's defeat of the Communist Party of Japan, a military law was enacted with the death penalty for anyone who participated in the assassination of Kimiko Iyoku in the city of Yamaguchi in 1994, which was executed on 18 July 1996. The law was repealed during the 1996 year and was replaced by the law concerning the flag and anthem, or the national flag of the nation. The law also banned the use and sale of the Olympic, Paralympic, and Olympic torch in Japan.\n\nHistorical significance\n\nThe law was written as a tribute to the country's history. It was repealed after the death of Kamui Shimada in 1987 as the first step in the modernization of Japan's armed forces, and this law was also repealed after the death of Kimiko Iyoku in 1994. According to the law, both national symbols and the national anthem should be used at all times in order to express the country's national and Japanese pride.\n\nHistory\nThe law was first enacted as a first step towards reform of the Japanese Armed Forces. Its passage was carried out as a pre-emptive act on the part of the Japan Defense Forces (Kudao), who fought against Allied expansionism in the south of Japan. Its final act was in 1996.\n\nSee also\n List of Japanese flags\n National Anthem\n National Flag\n National Anthem of Japan\n National Movement\n Flag of Japan\n Japanese history\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nJapan Official Website\nOfficial site\nOfficial site","token_len":475,"entropy":[8.6261,7.4329,2.3352,5.7071,7.2332,2.2197,2.9988,2.2867,5.6623,2.029,1.0486,5.161,1.8678,11.7615,7.1179,1.6066,13.1832,5.9066,1.2663,1.039,6.8685,4.8155,3.8937,2.4123,3.568,6.6025,0.011,0.6923,1.8235,0.4868,1.703,7.7825,0.3727,0.354,0.3725,6.0956,0.1121,1.5326,10.4612,2.4289,2.6366,2.6012,6.2864,1.0605,2.6647,4.6098,0.0136,4.9768,0.3406,0.0004,0.8195,3.4461,4.628,0.0097,0.5419,4.8133,0.0167,0.0016,0.5905,3.3539,1.0887,3.7327,2.8733,0.6826,5.588,1.522,4.3439,2.9734,6.3071,0.9963,7.85,0.3179,5.6095,9.0628,1.6923,4.3022,1.0592,3.5967,0.0022,3.5627,0.6032,3.2615,0.9563,3.1631,1.8359,3.2868,12.5107,8.7425,3.6218,5.4887,4.4342,2.7277,1.803,0.8994,1.1462,3.2993,4.4006,1.9123,5.5231,1.3327,0.6487,1.7867,0.2827,1.7001,0.3814,1.4203,7.2411,1.5157,1.0001,3.1065,2.0097,1.9295,3.6596,4.4627,3.664,2.157,7.5923,0.2007,5.1428,4.6215,0.9924,0.6115,0.6299,4.6628,5.587,1.1384,1.8073,0.8669,0.3227,2.3691,1.0667,5.8665,6.0971,6.5008,5.1877,2.2072,1.5546,4.0347,7.5121,0.0307,0.81,3.6418,1.7537,2.743,1.4938,1.2049,1.0655,2.3342,1.1346,1.3056,3.4777,3.2427,1.2482,5.8643,3.6744,4.1211,5.6711,1.8053,2.7025,3.6185,0.466,5.0557,1.5586,0.5951,0.0306,0.9026,5.0187,4.6999,0.2361,5.6936,2.8574,0.4142,4.9651,0.392,1.3073,0.2474,1.2095,3.0523,5.3757,3.9859,0.2834,2.2861,4.9259,0.5983,7.3019,0.2605,1.0635,2.871,0.6738,4.5388,0.0158,1.2959,3.868,0.2236,4.2285,7.9726,4.0667,4.2853,6.0561,1.254,2.5797,4.3337,0.0119,5.5847,0.3591,0.1461,0.8225,3.7612,2.2922,2.8498,1.1607,4.6498,2.3307,5.9825,2.7747,2.5083,0.3091,1.3591,0.7095,0.9203,3.2327,5.2793,0.332,4.734,6.1636,2.7025,2.0431,2.5372,0.5299,0.4905,3.6616,3.8324,0.7092,3.9962,0.936,3.1709,2.9623,5.6433,1.7838,1.3501,1.3658,4.7233,1.2944,3.8873,0.8577,1.4174,0.839,2.5767,3.1681,1.1794,1.3824,4.8889,3.5157,0.0392,2.1399,8.0562,4.3789,1.6911,0.0008,0.0196,0.9775,1.4671,3.3787,5.0617,1.8639,0.7925,0.6373,2.2533,0.015,5.8542,0.3097,4.9706,1.0898,0.0003,1.2238,2.5431,1.0238,4.7551,2.776,0.5002,5.5598,0.0382,0.415,4.0826,0.283,2.999,2.121,0.9613,0.8397,6.0552,2.6792,0.7285,3.3031,0.1018,6.398,2.4685,4.6944,2.3935,1.2087,4.4231,4.5318,2.0466,2.801,5.4321,1.3998,1.3344,4.3938,0.1034,1.6913,1.3678,3.2416,0.0073,2.2196,1.6287,6.2374,1.5671,0.9162,2.9878,1.5773,1.589,0.4387,2.3043,0.0104,3.2166,2.1897,0.163,0.0584,0.0066,0.2997,2.3968,0.4607,5.2181,0.0019,1.1101,2.7638,0.3993,5.8863,2.8925,3.5104,0.5865,1.3823,0.3294,0.5504,2.799,0.2839,3.1497,3.6875,0.7406,0.405,1.8955,4.1678,0.089,3.9904,1.5203,1.0388,0.0624,2.4209,3.5728,2.4211,3.1501,0.6033,1.4008,0.0002,3.7261,0.727,17.2294,0.9844,0.5038,3.28,1.7544,2.9067,0.2237,6.5203,0.6553,2.5749,6.1983,0.6927,0.5889,2.3537,2.689,0.0071,2.1249,4.1877,2.5609,1.4894,3.9751,0.0337,3.2459,0.5899,6.2844,1.8128,0.2954,0.0175,2.7785,3.8238,1.495,2.9438,0.0013,0.611,5.0189,4.7386,0.7606,1.7022,3.9029,6.6324,7.3548,1.724,2.5244,5.7043,1.9431,4.9957,5.8006,1.0627,1.4443,0.6158,4.0631,1.6879,2.3227,0.9641,4.3566,3.775,1.0605,0.4945,3.7959,3.2396,2.4987,1.3326,0.0002,5.7745,0.4392,1.1819,22.4787,0.0392,2.5324,5.5335,1.7044,21.002,3.3819,1.5658,20.0682,1.1875,0.9215,19.5543,0.451,1.4673,0.6443,0.5209,19.9228,9.7752,0.9551,17.7897,1.1633,0.579,0.5941,17.5723,7.6999,0.7205,0.0209,2.5432,0.9297,0.0008,5.5142,0.3095,0.9932,0.0006,4.5035,5.4579,2.4489,1.2113,24.2487,3.9747,1.6373,20.638,2.4713]}

In 1939, it was destroyed by Nazi attack on Germany. Following the war, the theatre industry had to deal with the loss of the old theatre group because the group needed to be replaced to keep to its original form. However, in 1939 there was no public replacement for the Old Vic, but a group of artists started to take up more positions. Even in the 1950s the Old Vic had to be rebuilt to accommodate both the British and US audiences due to increased attendance. The last UK theatre group to lose a stage with the end of the war, it had to have a new name. Then, the organisation became confused and it was the group that lost their artistic identity and became one of the oldest theatre groups, behind the theatre industry as well as the US.\nWhat has happened?\nIn 1956 the Old Vic was the only Old Vic in the UK that remained open and its new members included:\nVivienne Carr\nThe Artistic Director\nJohn P.

They briefly fell to 2nd in September that year before regaining 1st place. They fell to 2nd, and fell back down to 3rd between October 25th and October 27th 2002.\n\nEngland are still ranked third, 4th and 5th behind only their rivals, France, the Netherlands and their hosts, Greece and Belarus. England have had an impressive start to the new Premier League season, finishing third in the league behind only Arsenal, Chelsea and Real Madrid, and third best in the league and outside the top two and five of every European qualification. That means they have only played two games so far this term. They won the Champions League with the 4-0 win in their last game against Leganes on 17 October to improve to 3rd position. The other six teams are at third place, with just one further game away from reaching the last sixteen of the English top flight.\n\nThe England squad and personnel\nAlthough most have spoken of the squad they would have been more than happy to use once they had finished their first season in the Premier League. As part of a player development programme, they recruited some key players for the first season and brought in the players that have been key to the squad.

{"id":1066,"ended":true,"length":457,"text":"Despite the odds he faced in the general election, Tufaro promised to campaign against O 'Malley, not taking defeat as an inevitability. He pointed to Bret Schundler, the mayor of Jersey City, as the best candidate to defeat Cuomo.\n\nAsked why he had chosen to pick the mayor of NYC, he said he made two choices. \"Some time out, I wanted to talk about what I really thought people should see in New York City, what the mayor should not see, and what we should do, and where we should be.\"\n\nTo that end, Tufaro, a lawyer and social activist, was involved in one campaign against Cuomo and then two. Following the primary, he said he had endorsed Bloomberg but that he had had the opposite experience because his mayoral campaign had only been considered as a matter of \"possibilities\".\n\nMeanwhile, he said that while the campaign was \"about to start\", the \"process we'd be moving through in order for the city mayor and his team to sort through this is a process which would have been more than enough. The city would be an incredible place to start with.\"\n\nIn the end, he said that he wanted to \"focus on what we're doing and on how the city manages it without ever really thinking about making a decision about what the city should do \".\n\nTufaro also reiterated his support for an independent candidate. If it failed to materialises at the polls, he hoped that there would be \"nearly no one else\" who opposes him. He said that for many of the candidates, \"it's the only time in history that I have seen the state get into a debate about the nature or the nature of these campaigns\".\n\nAt the same time, though, the Tufaro was also aware of the pitfalls of having him in the running so early. He acknowledged that the campaign had to start from the ground up because he wanted to \"move the whole thing forward\" and was eager of pushing through legislation for the people who were most affected by the coronavirus.\n\n\"I wanted to do all the best for New Yorkers,\" he said. \"So, it was about as close as I'm willing to get to getting elected to Congress, and I was really happy to do business with the mayor who's chosen to run as a Democrat\".","token_len":481,"entropy":[2.0585,7.4918,5.2093,5.9185,2.6152,1.2295,6.8627,0.1152,0.3647,6.6768,6.8574,5.0523,6.5816,0.78,5.4105,2.5361,8.0032,9.1705,9.152,2.2636,4.8954,9.0726,8.4208,2.6082,1.2002,3.5681,0.0008,0.6764,2.2029,5.5024,1.0589,12.2332,5.2835,9.6618,0.5059,0.8969,1.2929,4.7288,0.3432,7.9944,0.0288,0.5975,1.4945,1.9219,4.6065,1.7686,1.3427,2.5621,6.8527,1.0179,1.3478,0.0007,5.0719,3.1397,0.8173,2.983,1.9798,1.5774,5.2619,2.7599,3.2237,1.8909,5.7432,0.9482,3.1075,0.9194,2.1176,6.1035,5.6864,1.0962,1.2725,2.6037,6.4283,5.4782,5.8022,1.2306,0.6812,4.6226,0.2249,5.2803,1.6167,2.859,0.8204,4.4624,2.9187,6.1914,2.0285,3.3543,1.7755,2.2277,0.0775,0.9089,1.7699,2.7863,3.1889,4.3284,1.3389,6.2355,0.092,1.5225,0.8585,0.9222,3.5565,0.8662,1.5732,4.1847,1.217,4.7299,0.5987,0.9399,2.4072,2.8723,0.2489,0.0003,5.3398,2.2082,0.1702,0.1023,0.8455,0.0078,0.003,4.4537,2.0891,4.9795,1.5481,5.2605,2.0607,0.3655,3.2859,5.791,0.208,4.8597,4.1341,3.2987,1.1116,2.5814,4.9262,5.5196,5.748,7.0136,1.0779,3.9007,0.7166,0.7206,3.9837,1.0081,2.9514,6.2746,7.383,3.8268,3.1802,0.5939,1.7012,5.1494,3.8574,4.7398,1.1201,5.0122,3.7082,6.0279,0.7227,1.2924,5.1953,1.374,6.9873,3.5872,0.505,4.5646,0.0045,3.2374,4.8045,5.4892,0.7626,3.1108,0.4862,0.0003,6.8841,0.1164,2.0825,1.8465,2.1371,3.4097,2.8297,3.5312,1.1604,2.248,4.9318,3.6943,2.1697,1.0328,2.537,3.2301,6.0404,5.1483,5.8225,3.115,4.4638,1.7877,3.2788,3.2522,2.8957,1.9246,3.7147,7.4507,2.8767,2.246,1.4344,0.1478,6.4951,2.1083,2.6092,1.5414,2.993,2.8551,3.6173,3.9702,3.1727,2.1408,4.1393,3.1083,5.2248,3.704,2.8843,3.2203,2.8943,1.709,5.0273,3.8852,1.2648,0.7965,2.6256,3.8661,1.5037,0.182,0.0002,2.9743,1.8253,1.0657,0.1698,1.5485,0.6811,1.8194,1.3723,3.8313,0.3816,2.6222,5.0048,0.3453,2.1434,1.9071,2.5548,1.2284,2.2462,5.2477,3.1631,3.5432,1.1614,6.8719,3.6315,5.8849,4.2368,3.9044,3.6146,0.2524,5.3546,1.8007,2.0649,1.4621,1.8471,2.3713,1.7526,1.1348,0.8257,8.7053,0.3148,0.0003,2.0987,0.0535,0.004,2.4103,5.6519,0.8699,2.3242,0.1372,4.9511,1.0005,4.0753,2.3713,6.5887,4.268,6.7693,0.7854,4.8045,8.464,4.8745,0.4854,2.8751,0.4234,0.3144,5.7307,1.3322,4.6502,0.1258,0.1341,2.4811,5.5029,2.5382,2.3886,3.2407,2.645,2.0812,2.009,9.838,1.3014,0.4632,2.8218,1.1099,0.9993,5.4617,3.9457,1.9103,1.1353,3.1382,1.5509,2.4195,2.7523,0.8267,3.0072,2.2903,4.9152,2.2585,2.6525,1.3328,2.6159,2.4115,3.2378,2.7114,5.7109,5.3135,4.1033,1.1276,5.3867,2.2532,2.4052,5.3235,4.4511,1.4992,2.8345,0.2284,6.1401,5.3053,1.1098,0.2293,0.0002,4.7445,0.6374,1.208,0.0206,0.0909,4.3964,0.0516,3.4537,5.4882,0.4179,0.031,6.925,2.5253,4.4373,1.1408,0.812,5.885,0.4706,4.2052,6.6931,2.162,0.689,3.2651,7.5323,0.8025,0.7738,2.0133,4.933,0.2415,2.3544,2.9219,1.2143,2.7058,4.3417,2.4528,2.1277,1.5372,0.0901,3.2031,2.0918,2.8906,0.3513,1.9347,4.1925,1.9336,5.5953,1.8082,0.3558,2.138,1.0382,3.4933,5.4281,8.1445,7.0381,2.3271,4.0759,4.7464,1.5723,5.3394,2.6921,2.8008,2.3924,1.5904,0.3731,0.6586,11.905,8.2399,1.8189,1.0435,0.3528,0.0002,1.3704,1.2704,3.3496,0.2922,2.7459,3.7956,1.4803,4.5264,2.407,2.4399,0.9928,1.9992,0.2518,0.18,0.3128,0.2709,4.143,2.742,3.3324,1.1933,3.2939,3.6295,2.9317,0.4545,0.412,5.0686,3.1935,0.05,1.5211,0.4863,2.7278,4.6843,2.1562,6.2084,1.8483,1.7113,1.2552,2.6873,3.6232,2.6843,0.9947,2.1695,8.7594,0.6256,1.3776,3.0187,4.3695,2.6575,6.0688,0.6997,0.8735,2.3412,1.1636,0.9893,4.3107]}

{"id":1366,"ended":false,"length":455,"text":"In June 2015, Valve announced that the entirety of Dota 2 would be ported over to the Source 2 game engine in an update called Dota 2 Reborn. The beta was released to the public on April 5, 2015, and it continues to grow and evolve around the release of the Source 2 developer community, while continuing a growing commitment to quality in-game, community-driven development through the core game engine.\n\nValve did not reveal what the original plans were for the studio\u2019s Source 2 engine, but they said it would work with Source 2 as the engine would be developed on and off-roader servers. That means Source 2 would only be able to run online on the Source 2 engine on its home computer, but there will also be a multiplayer mode where players who work remotely as Dota 2 servers can be teamed up in multiplayer on a Dota 2 server.\n\nSince their last update to source 2, Valve have stated that the studio is looking forward to the new experience and that they will continue to put out quality products. The engine is not available in any other form for the Source 2 player, however, and Valve is working on adding it in other ways to provide players with the latest content. For example, Valve\u2019s Dota 2: Reborn support means that Dota 2 users can access the Source 2 source engine in many different ways.\n\nValve has also announced that it will release a new game named Dota 2: Heroes of Death on March 2 and February 23rd. Dota 2: Heroes of Death will use Dota 2 for many of the other game mechanics, but Valve is developing the combat system so that Dota 2 players can win a game. Dota 2: Heroes of Death will also include a world map that will add competitive and strategic scenarios into the game. They also promised to add some of the player-controlled Dota 2 tournaments to Dota 2, and Dota 2: Heroes of Death will include one each for player- and team-controlled Dota 2.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our goal to provide a competitive experience for Dota players. We are very excited to continue to support their game, and look forward to contributing to their success,\u201d said Steve Smith, who also worked at Valve during the developer community\u2019s history. \u201cOur commitment to quality is our focus and we are pleased to continue the progress that we have made on Dota 2.\u201d","token_len":486,"entropy":[7.8939,2.8967,0.1356,8.662,1.2138,1.1189,2.4925,9.5842,0.0043,4.3501,0.0437,0.8542,0.3815,4.8473,2.0957,0.2901,2.2141,7.1061,5.0021,4.3607,0.7882,3.7533,3.1323,4.3812,2.3882,2.8602,0.0726,4.6368,0.349,1.6759,6.6843,2.3613,1.7987,2.7694,0.7231,0.1863,0.8967,3.1942,3.5652,0.5115,1.4936,1.1966,0.6676,2.5952,5.5903,0.2467,2.4955,2.7504,1.5509,6.9153,0.638,3.2998,0.3223,1.0386,1.5573,0.2986,7.2296,3.2096,2.945,5.5779,4.0581,5.6983,4.7261,5.247,0.161,4.3425,3.5119,5.8576,0.1135,5.3568,2.9559,0.9621,0.5797,0.9245,5.6882,1.5585,6.3528,2.1672,0.4846,0.4151,0.6286,0.0003,5.1154,0.0016,5.6087,0.4043,2.801,2.9274,1.5738,5.7486,5.1555,0.7023,0.1513,0.6965,6.6936,16.188,6.4914,5.887,6.1998,0.1546,2.5069,0.7546,0.6454,3.327,3.5604,1.8161,0.6544,4.898,1.0232,3.3673,0.5548,2.9359,2.7003,2.0924,3.9554,1.3424,3.2254,2.2057,5.9644,3.3351,1.7743,7.2435,0.5187,4.9194,0.8304,4.465,2.5295,3.252,0.0452,1.2919,4.3311,1.201,1.5742,0.0039,1.7206,7.2741,3.0156,2.4482,0.9604,0.1992,3.0277,4.6657,2.8717,5.7695,4.1502,1.0518,2.3368,3.7767,2.7912,2.6382,0.0473,1.7089,4.7762,1.9375,2.566,1.016,6.6024,5.5638,4.1367,4.8892,4.8618,0.1124,3.1993,0.9333,3.8078,4.568,0.1195,3.9648,3.5679,4.7636,1.9842,5.7026,0.0532,0.1193,0.5379,0.7262,0.0002,5.6064,5.5169,3.8858,2.1518,2.4844,5.3605,0.5938,0.801,0.4711,2.7557,4.6758,0.2118,1.7661,4.0658,1.7581,2.9422,2.8896,0.0045,2.3741,2.9413,5.2805,1.7071,2.5289,1.4115,1.5513,1.204,0.2523,5.8961,1.441,3.7559,5.7229,1.8608,2.3974,6.3312,1.5809,3.771,4.0295,2.6916,3.4377,1.7304,3.0239,2.8671,1.9731,1.1162,0.0823,4.792,2.2283,3.5391,0.7679,2.1394,2.1955,2.476,2.4205,1.0046,3.1837,2.4082,3.301,4.2628,1.9166,2.6881,3.9442,3.6479,0.3158,1.8675,3.9463,3.7162,1.1561,4.3835,0.9337,0.0383,2.1844,15.3318,0.9658,0.0168,2.7211,0.0522,5.4663,4.3716,5.6555,6.7486,0.506,3.1325,0.0276,3.9834,0.8778,3.8761,1.0275,2.1875,0.0267,2.7173,1.6409,2.338,4.8665,1.1114,0.2876,1.2243,1.0743,0.0002,3.0639,0.0013,1.7837,1.2363,1.6899,0.4441,1.7593,0.7782,2.4697,1.3067,1.3337,3.0181,7.0421,2.6397,0.0974,0.6579,3.6016,0.2766,8.205,2.9235,3.4517,3.5848,4.3704,5.1244,3.2866,4.0978,0.8425,3.3984,0.0175,0.4412,0.0596,0.0925,0.0345,1.1053,4.4703,3.1098,0.0591,4.897,4.9821,1.0479,0.3785,5.5321,3.0841,2.6234,1.6166,2.3603,3.4238,1.8854,5.5214,2.3868,7.2043,0.9649,3.9149,0.437,3.8236,0.0337,0.7216,0.6039,5.6151,3.1054,2.5167,2.4929,3.1319,0.0149,0.4253,0.0451,0.0835,0.0114,0.7645,1.2245,2.2603,1.3472,6.305,1.3838,2.1014,1.6861,5.1396,7.8056,2.7833,3.7023,5.66,4.3215,0.3272,0.35,0.452,6.3032,1.4121,4.8056,1.5494,1.8948,3.4313,2.8833,0.2239,5.3057,1.8126,2.652,4.6004,0.1179,7.1133,1.2539,2.1471,0.0245,1.7329,2.0462,4.295,0.0251,0.6875,0.1214,0.0995,0.0442,0.5244,2.5747,5.0,6.3748,1.2425,6.7128,1.1079,5.9507,0.7542,0.0052,0.4199,2.4445,0.0329,1.3387,0.3284,0.0002,7.1908,6.6857,7.0959,6.2431,2.0103,0.0567,4.6536,1.508,0.314,2.3584,1.9388,3.2355,2.3576,0.8673,2.3299,3.8824,2.4532,1.2115,1.6504,3.6282,0.384,0.7581,3.5382,1.1546,3.1402,6.7312,2.0884,2.0952,0.5705,3.964,0.0038,0.0049,5.2873,0.4204,2.4041,2.631,3.6883,9.5435,7.7362,6.3293,5.4832,4.7096,0.2655,4.9695,3.8834,2.057,2.0547,0.2307,2.9923,0.4948,6.3661,2.857,6.2465,0.5019,0.0359,4.3845,0.3625,4.3427,0.262,3.8015,4.332,0.1983,1.383,1.8033,3.3651,3.7082,1.8867,0.8712,1.5137,4.6731,0.43,1.6968,4.1326,4.0888,2.3625,0.8631,0.9506,0.1376,2.7474,2.632,0.0344,1.4407,2.6293,2.2475]}

The television broadcasts's audio tracks served also for use on radio. The three opposition parties have not recorded television coverage of their statements.\n\nThe Montreal Gazette reported in 1950, the Quebec Broadcasting Corporation, together with the Radio-Quebec, had been given permission to broadcast news on CBC radio. But it did not allow for an audience for the broadcast; the public broadcasting agreement was different.\nIn 1948, the Montreal Gazette quoted the Quebec Government as saying \"The radio will be kept up to the highest standards of information, and it will not be aired in any place where it is allowed\".\n\nIn November 1950, CBC Radio became the first Canadian broadcast television and was broadcast in Qu\u00e9bec. The Montreal Gazette reported in 1951 that Qu\u00e9bec was at the \"peak public broadcasting\" stage. The radio became a \"starchitect\", covering radio programmes, documentaries and reports.\n\nA public-radio news in 1958 was the public television program CBC TV, featuring interviews with Canadian politicians. In 1961 there was no CBC TV, with the exception of radio programmes, or documentaries.\n\nThe first public and televised CBC radio broadcasts were from Ottawa in the mid-1960s, followed by the first public broadcaster in Quebec, the Quebec Broadcasting Corporation in 1957.\n\nIn 1969, an international broadcast was made.

With Mr. Mather working towards his plan to eliminate the constitutional loophole in the Constitution between a Canadian national and United States citizen, the Society would continue to seek to safeguard the constitutional and legal integrity of Canadian citizens.\n\nIn August 2010, it was announced that the President of the Order will be George Michael Mulvaney, a noted Canadian politician who has served on the Canada-U.S. Friendship Council and the Canadian Academy of Social Sciences and has been an active supporter of the Standing Orders.\n\nIn June 2014, Mulvaney is an independent lawyer appointed by the Government of Canada. His confirmation is now expected on October 1, 2014 at the Canada-U.S. Friendship Council Meeting.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Canadian Order and the Canadian Association for Judicial Reform\n Official site on the Canadian Order of Canada","token_len":487,"entropy":[11.5768,2.083,10.5082,0.0382,6.6506,7.7398,0.0389,1.9043,7.3227,2.0183,0.8725,2.674,0.3593,8.3175,4.2617,1.425,3.0791,0.4452,9.156,1.8622,5.5858,1.3267,8.6421,6.5316,4.4531,5.8358,0.0613,6.6083,4.0087,1.0677,2.8029,10.6504,7.6763,5.8206,3.887,1.207,4.4213,0.1785,0.4507,2.7747,2.4391,0.8885,0.4647,6.5163,1.1934,1.426,0.0032,1.59,6.869,1.9606,5.3558,2.1223,2.3047,3.2344,0.069,3.2389,1.1792,0.6563,2.7824,3.4692,1.9592,3.5459,0.0102,0.1397,2.7863,6.1166,2.9817,2.6138,2.1593,2.2821,1.6895,3.1534,4.7355,2.2937,4.9946,1.9129,0.0043,1.7252,5.1267,0.2169,1.5531,3.8053,4.2048,9.1703,4.838,5.9815,1.4299,3.5613,3.3145,0.3041,3.5251,0.0691,5.758,0.4575,0.5974,6.7455,4.4907,3.9026,1.9836,4.8291,0.1168,3.0254,6.8601,0.4726,1.6272,2.5613,2.9807,4.2328,3.6196,2.1801,4.7047,0.9199,0.7123,0.2318,3.5494,4.6063,3.063,3.9017,1.1636,6.7847,5.8555,4.2603,7.7218,0.2255,2.7635,1.1533,2.6275,0.9517,1.8263,1.8355,2.3367,4.1344,4.2475,1.2562,0.9225,0.0003,0.9894,4.1227,0.3276,2.0687,2.5223,4.6174,2.0879,0.4074,4.3268,1.6929,1.7111,3.9639,1.2049,1.6211,2.6667,5.2371,6.0835,0.1159,2.1491,3.8173,0.212,4.0726,3.8291,2.9934,3.4017,2.299,4.8767,4.6865,0.38,4.6867,6.4048,0.9657,1.4543,3.2313,0.0839,3.3603,1.7066,1.7708,2.6438,3.956,2.04,0.6458,0.687,6.0622,1.9276,4.8105,3.5623,3.8208,1.2215,0.8664,1.7418,1.9309,2.3184,0.6268,1.0872,0.2704,0.341,3.6338,2.8204,4.369,0.9098,1.3734,0.0722,5.8738,3.8507,4.8387,3.2414,5.8184,0.6928,0.3092,2.7381,5.706,5.8359,2.8453,2.4293,2.4991,5.25,0.0055,0.9375,2.303,0.5353,0.1052,0.5807,0.0003,6.267,0.911,0.0588,0.0013,2.8401,1.4816,1.2956,0.5931,5.2161,0.967,4.6314,1.9661,6.6929,3.3051,0.0023,4.927,0.4979,0.0041,0.1102,0.0036,0.0009,2.4107,4.7847,6.3426,4.2332,2.1471,5.5647,3.9459,3.0704,4.3248,1.0961,0.8746,3.8597,0.9233,2.2561,4.322,1.3988,4.9964,0.355,5.1794,1.4509,4.5514,0.6857,0.9305,3.6607,3.9135,0.0134,1.004,4.0583,0.9936,5.6825,0.1104,1.9389,0.3059,3.2753,1.533,0.3045,1.5975,4.8477,0.0836,4.1591,0.1578,1.214,0.0002,2.221,4.1717,0.2305,5.7183,0.9652,3.6356,0.0386,5.2157,0.6438,2.8855,1.0802,0.5462,2.6098,5.3717,3.5117,0.1514,0.7539,0.25,1.492,1.3876,5.9007,0.0174,4.152,4.818,0.242,5.8729,3.2331,1.3522,3.029,2.2878,0.1028,1.5128,1.1725,6.4876,2.5796,0.0005,0.2436,0.0008,6.493,6.1444,2.4892,6.1599,0.3959,5.2075,1.466,6.6736,7.2164,1.3091,0.6903,3.1805,6.446,5.1908,3.0297,5.1382,0.4251,4.9963,0.0517,1.0985,0.3671,1.046,3.4367,5.6339,3.9178,0.362,4.0351,1.59,6.1751,1.1954,3.6036,4.3273,2.4862,1.9807,0.0204,1.8875,2.9869,1.1695,0.5792,0.0002,1.8201,4.002,3.6617,0.103,4.7128,0.5718,0.6826,0.1362,0.9297,6.7513,0.3105,0.1763,2.9938,4.4857,1.2644,7.5476,5.8437,7.7952,3.4792,0.0012,0.5693,2.3136,6.2101,1.949,3.3473,1.7751,1.0043,1.5736,1.9169,0.5703,4.6851,3.0212,1.0573,0.0038,0.0049,0.0491,3.1728,1.4596,1.5948,1.8201,1.5026,5.0571,0.0756,2.3165,0.3018,2.6104,2.1281,1.77,2.6229,1.692,2.4989,0.0659,0.8419,6.7077,4.6331,1.0392,0.7117,0.0002,1.9513,2.9827,2.6766,0.0582,4.9349,0.0031,0.0015,5.0239,5.5184,3.876,5.7836,4.1358,0.4041,0.7428,4.3665,0.0553,0.1315,2.0222,2.9524,5.9574,2.1923,5.4538,3.2803,3.6257,3.0322,1.7224,0.4418,2.1789,4.8646,0.6111,5.8059,0.4252,0.0596,0.0006,0.0005,0.0284,0.6893,0.1581,5.2671,0.5902,0.4703,0.0002,5.6682,0.724,0.0003,5.4968,0.8019,0.5021,20.9656,3.95,5.2836,1.7921,1.5161,3.2131,1.9845,5.8922,0.4928,1.6715,21.9344,6.5843,4.0149,1.1859,0.7838,1.1627,2.4063,0.8788]}

He also held the position of treasurer of the Scottish Presbyterian Church and the Scottish Presbyterian Church.  Between 1847 and 1851 he served in many committees which included the Secretary of the Scottish Presbyterian Church and Secretary of the Scottish Parliament, although this was dissolved in 1856 due to the Scottish Parliament's dissolution.\n\nHe was married twice, firstly to Emma M.

In addition to the Latin form we also have \u00ab\u00a0shkh\u2013\u00a0.\n\nIn general, in Russian, both the khema and shkh are given by the following formulas:\n\n \u00ab\u00a0\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\".\n\nThe khema is the simplest form for English in terms of pronunciation. The Khmeena alphabet uses the name Khmeena as a suffix, but there is a third one that contains the first letters of the Khmeena alphabet. In order to use the Khmeena alphabet instead of the Russian equivalent, the Khmeena code was changed and therefore the syllable (kho) was changed into the Khmeha. In the beginning of the Khmeena alphabet, the following three letters were pronounced Khmeena (kho) and Khmeena (khme) respectively, and then Khmeena (khmea)-\u00a0. This was no longer the case when Khmeena was changed to \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u044e ( \u041c\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043d, Khmeena), as in the Khmeena in the Georgian. In general, the three letter Khmeena are used.\n\nThe name Khmeena, or Khmeena in Russian, is often given in the Khmedruli dialect. Although this spelling is used by Khmeena in all types of languages, in a Khmeena dialect Khmeena cannot be properly known.\n\nReferences","token_len":490,"entropy":[7.2489,10.8404,5.1818,9.4369,5.5181,1.6685,10.0478,0.9006,10.9621,7.6866,7.075,1.4218,5.5155,1.3013,2.5271,9.8855,0.3005,0.1388,0.002,10.1095,8.2623,11.9764,1.47,2.542,1.2643,2.4185,0.2404,7.2868,4.0782,3.17,10.5892,8.7458,10.6408,3.5863,6.4103,3.2051,12.5452,12.2748,9.7985,2.9989,4.3673,2.299,4.0523,5.3943,4.8345,0.2124,0.1941,2.8608,2.8989,6.1261,0.5388,4.7284,1.6936,2.6929,0.0059,2.2624,13.1719,6.0692,4.0149,3.5177,2.7314,5.5633,2.6469,0.0195,0.1091,1.4292,5.7112,4.295,2.1709,2.2174,2.5053,1.8312,4.6706,4.4326,3.2067,4.1289,1.1503,5.8129,4.5702,2.6758,4.9343,0.6209,6.1513,4.5921,3.9253,3.7083,5.0678,2.631,6.3963,4.6401,1.8888,4.1023,2.0631,5.1258,1.6332,1.461,3.9796,4.3681,3.5905,1.9248,3.4637,2.7612,8.2141,6.8307,3.1878,5.0342,4.7593,0.0603,0.6432,2.7618,2.2927,3.0786,2.0737,2.8861,2.134,8.2842,2.9253,5.9496,2.3643,1.2334,2.7606,3.7434,1.5807,0.282,7.3435,4.1795,4.2957,1.9699,2.9013,1.1033,3.9367,1.0826,5.179,1.761,3.707,4.7268,2.4256,2.3803,6.3641,0.0297,0.2891,2.1919,0.4366,1.8725,0.5073,1.908,0.1663,2.3746,1.8644,1.087,1.8132,0.0238,1.5519,3.2941,0.3948,0.3697,4.9795,2.874,1.2509,6.5019,1.8243,3.4104,1.6862,1.0064,4.4827,2.0034,5.0507,5.1333,5.8839,2.9266,1.3255,1.4513,2.7246,4.2056,0.8273,5.1907,3.4316,5.8872,1.7374,3.1028,0.0326,0.413,0.6857,0.2728,0.7997,5.4176,3.057,1.3097,2.5079,2.9528,1.2111,1.0161,2.9901,1.1531,5.9982,1.9912,0.5247,5.956,1.8622,3.5628,0.4303,6.8816,2.8465,1.8002,1.1672,0.0007,2.5974,4.9995,0.5293,4.2631,2.7143,1.5658,4.9165,1.1929,2.5168,0.1792,0.0778,0.2282,3.2013,0.0194,0.932,5.4814,2.7662,1.1477,4.5604,5.8586,0.7818,5.5834,18.6216,2.2155,6.1948,8.7534,2.1352,0.6904,1.7076,3.6175,6.6029,1.3246,0.0007,1.9488,2.1708,0.1176,0.0522,1.1995,2.9881,5.8336,1.3275,3.7583,5.1685,3.5746,3.6994,0.0068,3.9087,0.9232,1.5779,6.9075,2.5703,6.5267,4.6193,4.9148,1.1843,5.5434,2.3179,0.2131,1.5379,2.2064,1.887,3.9095,1.5234,2.3291,3.6339,0.8761,1.9306,4.8247,4.3907,2.6329,5.135,1.3023,4.401,3.2751,0.9478,0.5117,3.4461,0.0448,0.1961,0.1255,0.8586,2.636,3.4124,0.0919,3.1898,0.9552,2.5707,0.0114,0.0214,0.4569,5.5869,0.0599,0.6142,2.9433,7.227,0.7447,1.5554,3.2491,0.042,0.0592,6.2855,3.3583,1.5803,4.0661,5.3531,1.0524,6.297,0.9783,4.8306,2.9004,3.3319,0.9008,1.6826,2.573,3.9712,1.0612,1.5356,0.0125,9.9266,3.0172,2.5437,1.9745,5.0054,0.5159,0.4873,3.0753,0.0142,0.4572,0.4068,0.771,0.8471,4.9388,4.1868,0.56,1.1869,4.0762,3.9083,0.1611,1.6197,2.6632,2.1374,0.6448,1.6968,1.7058,2.2092,0.0601,0.3981,0.5135,1.407,1.8404,1.6486,3.4156,2.44,2.0077,3.0679,3.017,0.0263,0.1345,1.2966,0.5165,0.3392,4.9129,5.9716,3.1563,1.8426,3.1046,2.6947,7.104,0.2563,1.6543,0.13,3.6499,2.3539,0.0101,0.0309,0.7965,5.1352,1.1181,4.0309,3.4921,2.6252,3.3848,2.2184,2.296,0.9582,3.1968,1.5935,1.6581,4.7752,3.8465,1.4176,2.2331,1.7619,2.5608,2.0619,3.5497,2.5774,3.7209,3.9948,2.907,0.0364,0.8577,3.0998,3.8111,2.1699,0.9773,2.4693,0.0232,0.1812,5.9794,1.499,5.2249,4.1337,2.4779,4.7939,0.1598,1.0325,5.2426,3.2015,2.008,0.0165,0.0796,4.0143,2.4348,5.1696,0.8054,0.0004,1.2588,4.8331,1.1108,0.0278,0.1828,3.1558,3.377,1.2251,0.0789,0.7116,3.3813,1.5489,0.4558,0.8559,4.1672,3.1254,1.9009,1.5382,3.2768,7.0421,4.8857,0.7224,3.3765,1.3828,5.3556,2.9342,5.3558,0.7443,3.8557,2.3856,3.6463,1.1302,0.3314,2.0675,3.92,7.2005,0.0443,1.7343,0.3573,2.623,4.4199,4.1071,0.8213,0.0399,0.9936,5.6967,0.0334,0.0314,4.9399,0.1691,5.4489,5.1586,0.8939,1.5999,0.0002,5.812]}
{"id":3347,"ended":false,"length":386,"text":"An Oberst at 28, M\u00f6lders was appointed Inspector General of Fighters, a post responsible for deciding the ongoing tactical and operational doctrine of the Luftwaffe's fighter strategies. Returning to Russia in 1940, Oberst Huxley fought as an aircrew chief for three months in the Eastern Air Force, and as a lieutenant general himself. Oberst Huxley achieved the rank of colonel as well as the rank of lieutenant general, commanding an aeroderma squadron (or bomber squadron) on the Luftwaffe's 'B-2B bomber bombers. During these three months and three months Oberst and his platoon led an attack on one of the bases in the Eastern Air Force Base. Oberst Huxley was also part of a larger squadron that attacked three bases. In October 1939 as he was returning to Germany, he crossed the Rhine at the age of 28 \u2014 at an estimated pace of 3,000\u00a0km\/h (1,200 miles per hour). Huxley was also part of a larger crew of aircrew that was deployed south in July 1939 to support the Allied forces in the occupied Czech Republic. The aircrews were part of a broader group of aircrew, some of whom also held the distinction of being part of an aircrew that had not reached the age where they were equipped. The aircrews were also part of the aircrews that would make up the final aircrew at Schwerin.\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union, Oberst Huxley was forced to leave Germany and return to his home of Oberst Huxley.

{"id":440,"ended":true,"length":457,"text":"Most of the MLs had been destroyed on the run in and were burning. The first ML in the starboard column was the first boat to catch fire ; her captain managed to beachboard the boat on the shoreline. On the surface she was a fairly low-maintenance tanker but at the point, she was a complete disaster. There were quite a few boats in the middle of the ocean (a lot of which had no engines). The deck was completely submerged and her engines got out of control. Her second boat, the G-2, was destroyed very quickly into the middle of the ocean and all of them were gone. That means that the only way to move her out was to sink everything (i.e. the entire fleet).\nThe final big tanker in the ship was the RZ100. It was destroyed after falling apart on a stormy afternoon off Florida. Most of the RZ100 remained floating in the water until the captain decided to destroy it. He managed to destroy the RZ 100, which was the engine of the last ship. That\u2019s all there is to that. The deck was destroyed. She was then transferred to the Haldimand Coast and it became a real tug and it\u2019s still in her watertight vessel (along where it is presently). The captain was actually surprised as well. He was thinking about his losses. Then he thought about it. He took the chance to save her. He was right. In fact, he said: \u201cLet\u2019s use this boat for now.\u201d But she was still floating on the water at that time and therefore the salvage was only a game. There didn\u2019t appear to be any hope for salvage. The salvage didn\u2019t seem capable of dealing with the destruction of the hull and most of the hull was completely destroyed. The ship left the coast early on Oct.13 and had no passengers. There were no papers, no permits or even tickets to visit the town of Haldimand.\nMost importantly, this is just the latest tragedy in the history of the Starboard Division. It is something that has no connection whatsoever with the events of this past year. It is an unfortunate development. Now we have the real history of the Haldimand fleet. It is more than just the last ship wrecked on the run from its owner but also a part of an entire fleet at this level.","token_len":494,"entropy":[2.9817,0.8519,11.2142,4.7405,4.0063,2.5314,6.3643,4.7486,1.1298,5.3861,3.3972,7.1777,5.0308,7.5896,2.618,2.0578,4.4313,3.4492,4.4263,1.1756,10.2367,3.0081,5.1632,1.1327,3.0931,3.219,7.9302,1.2951,6.2375,0.5832,9.3288,7.6976,2.5382,6.2817,0.0628,11.8325,7.1161,1.4989,2.3388,3.4583,1.0707,4.6223,4.4533,1.4109,4.0024,0.9488,5.8781,3.6768,0.8563,2.7642,4.9591,5.0272,1.2608,3.6011,0.0304,7.5092,4.3699,4.0331,1.4309,6.0037,5.0943,2.0934,0.8532,3.0078,5.9591,1.9436,0.4429,4.1177,0.844,5.8109,0.0757,0.2694,5.0698,2.1509,0.4487,5.8549,0.3706,0.2231,4.321,4.7297,4.1202,3.9106,0.3402,2.4569,1.6422,3.6254,3.4394,2.7705,1.5034,4.6273,0.8629,3.8609,3.789,1.3804,3.786,2.6798,6.7823,2.1481,0.9712,1.7596,0.8159,4.2713,5.3589,2.6953,1.655,1.2931,5.63,3.4629,2.866,0.539,0.967,3.2424,5.6262,1.1792,8.6953,0.618,4.1863,0.0657,0.0874,1.4493,2.7012,3.9686,1.7178,3.9605,1.0328,4.8867,0.6315,5.3569,4.8741,0.7065,1.4693,3.6935,2.9152,0.751,6.1875,1.7829,3.4357,3.1264,0.4983,4.2414,6.4511,4.7505,5.0965,0.0025,0.0019,0.8011,1.3287,3.7227,4.221,1.074,2.5234,3.5137,4.6511,5.3494,5.4986,3.3275,0.1737,4.2458,0.9081,0.5294,4.0895,5.3931,7.0437,1.3981,1.2353,0.5864,4.4171,4.3789,6.1389,4.6975,2.6037,2.5498,4.5419,1.2827,4.2617,5.1756,5.82,0.7295,5.3875,0.2716,0.2415,3.7129,0.0266,0.0984,6.8826,4.5076,1.3227,0.313,1.8714,3.1341,1.4616,6.9642,3.1297,0.4223,3.4577,0.5563,0.774,3.6032,4.6296,0.0307,4.3104,1.3966,2.4414,0.0167,5.4772,2.9147,2.1717,1.0773,2.7673,6.239,0.9726,0.4098,3.7779,1.7504,3.101,4.0492,19.1962,7.7863,3.0866,4.4236,3.0438,0.6487,0.1811,5.0452,1.0962,2.2762,5.1245,1.1153,3.6039,2.2472,3.7354,0.8069,4.3795,6.1247,0.1936,0.7388,6.2369,6.501,3.2833,0.9409,5.9379,3.189,3.9694,3.787,1.3982,5.0403,5.0996,4.4337,3.6399,7.8762,0.2805,0.223,2.9393,2.8773,4.1673,5.5179,4.0192,4.8721,3.7518,6.4834,11.0371,1.5621,2.896,6.676,2.3935,1.959,4.078,2.5831,5.4381,4.7967,5.4409,3.6127,1.3707,1.414,2.4179,3.6742,1.2445,4.231,7.1744,2.1444,4.8349,0.8262,2.882,0.6399,4.422,1.4924,1.449,4.6819,1.733,5.3008,0.8688,3.7997,2.1798,1.1261,1.1384,2.7883,4.4208,0.4132,4.3327,1.4948,0.3306,0.7289,4.6809,4.5635,4.2905,6.3355,6.5879,4.5691,2.1817,0.0919,5.503,1.8423,4.0868,2.812,5.7603,0.9994,4.6196,5.8559,4.059,3.6394,1.3368,2.3888,3.7985,3.2596,0.6019,1.7261,4.0391,1.4546,1.1589,2.2514,6.2147,3.1264,6.7329,2.2314,4.1201,2.0535,7.3992,0.898,3.7404,6.6859,1.0062,1.4893,0.1573,3.2121,0.1196,0.0248,0.3809,4.1211,1.5682,4.3622,0.8853,2.0029,4.0989,4.286,0.0926,0.2263,0.1104,1.5735,8.7162,0.1281,4.9282,0.0334,1.164,5.7749,0.4901,1.0921,3.6064,2.5771,5.4847,0.3992,0.2742,3.4807,1.1418,3.4753,1.4814,0.4086,1.5614,2.873,5.3284,0.8372,4.0666,6.0131,2.0217,7.7784,0.4673,8.1137,1.6549,3.7957,3.1054,4.2825,1.1447,3.2,0.8431,1.8971,7.4916,2.0035,0.6412,7.1617,2.1487,2.9648,6.1451,1.8853,5.0529,0.8599,6.1603,1.3562,3.7769,0.0723,0.0033,0.0017,0.5987,2.701,6.2353,4.6264,0.3349,4.3904,2.8433,3.4726,1.3726,3.909,4.2344,1.1602,0.6159,1.4625,0.0038,0.7699,5.2184,3.6341,4.9044,0.302,2.5614,1.5001,5.0078,0.5649,1.7647,5.2023,5.003,2.7444,1.0945,0.5785,3.8565,0.5077,2.7415,2.2425,1.3464,0.3709,1.8733,0.8762,3.6419,3.5086,4.6991,1.4854,6.1999,2.8629,1.2401,2.2567,5.3931,6.0058,0.529,0.6659,5.3943,0.0479,0.0021,0.002,5.3267,0.7995,1.9261,0.7908,5.4264,0.9858,1.2604,2.0803,4.0461,1.8421,4.7098,1.987,0.8193,3.4315,4.4537,4.7986,4.0203,5.0802,1.2215,2.5282,3.9062,0.0246,3.4764,2.4654,1.0889,6.2101,1.999,7.0407,0.3692]}

{"id":1606,"ended":true,"length":480,"text":"One @ - @ day track and field meetings form the most common and seasonal aspect of the sport \u2013 they are the most basic level of track and field competition. Meetings are generally held between 4 and 5 o'clock in the morning in a warm room and typically last up to twenty minutes. It usually begins with a round of warm drinks in a corner of the room and an announcement of the start of a new round of matches. One can also expect up to 24 athletes on the track at a time who may need extra help, in addition to the equipment for each round and the participants are given the option of attending one of 3 rounds of competitions.\n\nHere is an example of what the event is like on the track at home. The track has three track and field courses: the 1st Track Championship, the 3rd Track Championship, and the 4th Track Championship. As we all know by now the top schools in New Zealand do not offer track & field courses in the winter ( and that is in most areas of New Zealand ), there may very well be some sort of need to have an extra track that can do the job in winter where there are other winter courses that may have to add and to accommodate the weather. At the same time there are quite a few countries in the world where this is a major issue\n\nOur Sports Manager is a full time athlete who is responsible for all of our games. Our sports director is actually a student who is one of the best and brightest track educators in the country.. who has an almost limitless array of training and advice to give to everyone on the track and field course at home.\n\nThis is where we work together to create the best training facilities for all our athletes. Each year the track coach and staff of our track and field teams go on a multi-year trip to train and run many of our athletes to become the greatest athletes on the planet.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the year each team member will receive a special training package from our support organisation to aid in training and conditioning. At this time we provide the following training solutions to any athlete who is struggling, as well as training and coach support.

The debut date was a weekend, February 17, 2014, between 2am and 11pm GMT (EDT). The special features a full English dub, while the third season premiered on January 27, 2015, with eight scenes that were filmed at the end of season 1.\n\nThe premiere had its beginning with a pre-screenings on February 1, 2017, with the first two episodes arriving on January 20. The remaining three episodes are scheduled and are due on February 25. That means that season 3 will be released on May 7th.\n\nIn addition to the five scenes that had been filmed at the end of season 1 as well as all those that have been planned for seasons three and four, the special features a live preview of episode 3. \"Here comes the real star of the show\", said Netflix founder Mark Pye, who had previously indicated in May 2015 that a sequel was in the works.\n\nSeason 3 also shows how the team that brought the original series ended up working for a company that offered only short cuts, some of which were in the form of cutouts, and which have been recorded for the special. For season 4, the special features a re-run of the original series.\n\nThe episode was originally going to be a part of the special, but was later dropped due to being a \"difficult\" time of production. Then, last year, Netflix announced that they added several more scenes to the special to allow the film to be longer. When asked to explain a decision to go ahead with the full series, Pye said that filming the second season didn't have to be a priority for this year.\n\nIt was first announced in December of 2012 that the first season of the series would premiere as part of the first season of the series. However, after more than 10 years of development of the series, the project had been cancelled. According to Pye, there are plans for the premiere to be delayed until at least year four. The sequel will consist in the same series which aired as part of the original series at the end of last year.\n\nThe series revolves around the journey of the team who created and managed the original series, which was an adaptation of the television series. After its debut, season 3 has reached 658 million, including 24 billion viewers.","token_len":500,"entropy":[8.8918,1.8927,3.8553,5.5526,2.7671,5.9575,1.1913,3.4196,3.5819,0.5932,2.0708,5.3465,0.6124,0.0007,1.0915,10.7784,2.0274,0.0437,6.8436,4.7159,0.6845,0.3221,3.6673,2.7017,0.7586,1.9358,3.6891,0.4721,1.7063,6.8451,4.9338,1.8848,5.2282,7.0869,2.5367,2.8413,3.7091,0.3366,2.302,1.2406,5.7027,2.8662,3.8869,0.4674,4.3802,0.8989,5.403,2.9327,5.6237,0.0015,0.5753,1.7442,5.0797,2.587,3.4772,3.8698,5.5001,1.2241,2.2707,4.7389,0.8446,6.6302,1.3084,3.7845,0.6462,2.4075,3.2176,0.1124,1.185,1.8806,2.5019,5.3783,6.5349,4.4296,0.9942,2.9403,2.9331,1.3492,3.721,0.0461,2.8545,1.2891,0.427,0.8553,0.0006,1.9558,4.1987,5.6307,3.1974,6.8909,2.6938,1.3137,5.71,0.74,4.5206,7.1183,4.3549,1.9351,2.4176,0.3095,5.3096,0.8764,2.5009,1.2492,2.1259,2.8587,0.6212,4.469,0.8408,2.2909,3.3937,2.7815,0.9341,5.3261,2.4552,0.1879,3.5267,2.8224,8.1705,3.0557,4.0062,2.8,1.7961,3.5895,1.3805,7.1005,3.0813,0.9435,4.2536,2.6877,1.0643,1.6603,2.0177,0.6679,3.0256,2.9713,3.1456,1.6596,0.6217,0.0003,3.3119,1.1737,0.2669,0.8717,4.7257,6.211,2.0407,5.1158,1.2432,0.4994,1.1511,0.1224,0.2922,0.0057,0.2699,0.132,6.2247,0.7196,0.0465,3.7675,5.2626,1.3262,2.2686,0.7321,6.1934,0.9716,3.5752,5.5494,0.3651,0.0968,0.1961,1.3304,2.198,0.3184,1.5455,3.9822,5.9467,0.3325,3.787,3.7949,2.1906,5.1591,6.4456,3.0784,0.9736,4.4672,4.5556,0.9906,0.9523,0.3209,3.3168,2.3369,5.4046,4.7296,4.6374,5.4793,9.6412,1.2351,1.3635,3.935,1.9912,5.5177,4.6026,5.0031,3.0931,0.0734,4.26,4.3644,1.9328,0.4976,0.2174,0.0649,0.4492,0.7901,0.0003,2.6051,0.5117,4.3629,6.4785,3.595,1.2862,4.1304,4.2988,3.6326,1.3794,2.3639,1.1466,7.5584,0.4581,2.6964,4.0831,2.9107,3.786,1.4701,6.3445,6.1772,5.0777,4.4824,3.0578,6.4934,0.5706,0.1041,0.9458,4.8042,1.9182,1.8988,0.0049,4.2842,4.4783,1.983,2.0426,4.0175,5.1416,1.6749,6.6655,2.1349,1.7061,4.1072,1.8648,4.7192,3.937,2.6213,0.1781,1.0777,2.3577,0.4215,0.992,4.7806,0.7997,3.2305,0.094,0.6971,1.3797,1.0608,2.0729,0.7529,0.0003,1.9406,3.2235,2.3311,3.0104,5.0655,0.0266,0.9836,2.7408,3.0224,0.0348,0.736,3.7529,1.1512,0.4896,2.4201,3.7001,3.1111,2.0008,0.003,6.1395,3.0923,2.8244,6.1147,0.0545,1.4393,3.881,5.2735,3.9997,0.6352,6.7116,0.9694,4.7396,1.3346,0.2484,1.9787,1.6208,0.508,2.4721,8.2043,5.127,2.596,1.0073,1.3167,0.5008,0.9155,2.9218,3.9766,2.347,5.4349,0.9964,0.8971,5.4233,1.1057,5.6189,2.9136,3.8382,1.8399,6.121,3.2767,1.3749,3.9743,4.4762,0.0876,0.8397,5.345,3.6423,0.4861,0.7465,0.0009,0.8616,1.3699,6.2595,2.96,3.5255,0.7338,5.4911,0.0005,1.8396,0.838,0.682,2.4342,4.0531,2.1265,5.642,2.0492,1.2126,0.5617,0.0002,4.7726,1.6211,5.8134,1.4859,1.2858,3.1986,3.3209,3.5384,0.4478,1.3225,2.6341,0.6387,0.5328,0.6746,1.9258,0.4977,1.9949,4.76,1.217,0.0013,0.8363,3.9975,0.9935,0.5982,1.0948,3.2453,0.9573,2.8778,0.023,3.0371,5.0023,0.0851,3.8331,0.6735,0.7035,2.6687,4.2968,0.2085,0.9866,0.2372,1.2865,3.8213,2.4779,1.6071,3.2172,1.6664,4.9395,0.0021,1.4306,0.0048,0.0912,3.3428,2.3918,3.1917,1.2701,1.6256,4.86,0.9241,0.78,4.231,1.1972,3.301,0.0074,6.0599,2.4678,1.3029,2.7678,6.7044,1.8887,5.7481,6.6269,2.2808,2.2977,4.2235,5.5568,3.4475,3.534,1.8779,0.0019,0.3508,1.003,0.5909,5.735,0.4615,1.5544,0.0156,3.332,0.2597,0.3935,0.4893,0.0003,1.9545,3.5945,5.7959,0.0057,2.2299,5.573,0.1638,2.7175,5.0947,2.2864,3.7147,2.7041,3.8596,0.3907,1.4436,0.9507,1.3817,3.1578,1.8391,5.543,3.103,0.0331,0.8259,6.8502,0.8855,2.5541,4.576,4.5642,3.053,1.3981,2.665,0.8009,3.7156,6.6874,6.8108,6.5724,3.1449,5.9645,4.9537,6.1464,4.9376,1.2787,0.97]}

By 2006, three major evangelical denominations, the Conference of the First Baptist Elders of the Church of God, the Conference of the First Baptist Churches of Christ, and the Conference of the First Baptist Women of God, had become \"the de facto denominational movement for women of faith.\" For the Neo and Pentecostal movements, \"the word 'principles' is one of the very first words and words of truth to the world of Jesus. And it is therefore essential for all of us to use only genuine and sincere doctrines and truths that serve Christ's call to love and respect His humanity... Jesus calls on us all to proclaim His love for His members in his words and deeds as a way of saying good-bye to the selflessness of our fellow men and boys.\n\n\"One person is the Son of God and in that person is the Father. The Son is Christ. That is all I ask you to do... to live in His image and to know Him first.\"\n\nWhen Jesus and His family prayed to their Lord for forgiveness, their disciples responded: \"Go and see what you are saying.... do not speak as if I am saying something contrary to Jesus. Go and see how it is. And do not speak to me that I know not what this means... do not utter words that I know not what this means... Do not talk nonsense to me that may embarrass me in your eyes. Have your brethren come and see a holy man by the name of [Jesus] in the midst of the crowds of men and women of His day.\n\n\"And go and see what you are saying... so that when you see the body of a holy man in the midst of the crowds of men and women of His day, you can tell that he is holy. You can call him by the name of a holy man. You can be the disciples of Heilig (Luke 22:10), and be the disciples of Christ. In the name of the Lord He will lead you where many things are impossible, through the power of His word, and in the same way that He led you, he will lead you to the Father.

The Rochester team that had originally planned to build and build a railroad track for its railroad line to West Point, Minnesota, was torn apart on February 12, 1924. Sitting Bull and Margaret were joined by three soldiers, Charles L., Lorna Waverley (17 years old) and Lorna K., both of whom was a descendant of Southern New York. Charles also had his name engraved on a white wooden plaque in the former Rochester area, and Margaret Hutton was named in honour of her late brother sitting Bull. All the four soldiers have been recorded as belonging to one of Sitting Bull's family, but none of them survived.\n\nIn addition to his father, Sitting Bull is noted for his mother, Margaret Waverley, whom sitting Bull married on October 11, 1839. Later known as 'Sitting Bull' (a variation of the name of Margaret Hutton which is similar to the one of Sitting Bull's late sister Margaret) Margaret was the wife of the man who had married her and was also the father of her son Charles Hutton.\n\nSitting Bull died on August 24, 1879, following a battle with an enemy ship. His legacy is marked by the dedication on his tombstone to his sister Margaret, and the fact that they were of the same race, and that Margaret was married to one of Standing Bull's older brothers Clarence.\n\nSee also\n List of people of Native American ancestry\n List of people of Central American ancestry\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\nCrimson and the Blood of the American Great Plains (1875): William and Frances Martin, \"In Search of the Red Rock: American History of the United States\", Wiley-Blackburn, 1997,.\n\nBibliography","token_len":502,"entropy":[6.7234,4.6748,10.8416,9.0797,4.5582,13.6084,0.8514,3.3268,4.126,14.9532,2.8153,1.0221,6.0968,2.5175,4.8534,1.4369,0.464,4.0939,0.4002,1.7277,3.9395,0.0174,2.634,5.8836,4.9595,3.1203,3.6136,0.2607,1.7226,4.4126,0.3029,2.7385,0.0006,3.2765,4.1496,7.1232,0.9656,5.5498,5.8428,0.735,5.3179,2.8322,8.7844,0.5091,1.3903,3.983,4.315,2.0138,4.3818,4.4543,3.7354,6.9374,1.9854,2.2622,4.77,3.585,0.9547,2.8399,0.0008,3.1746,3.3985,0.0012,0.9362,5.0301,4.3745,4.0945,5.8734,0.7074,4.372,4.7476,7.1027,0.5202,1.9937,5.2409,1.2786,4.4118,1.3858,0.9179,5.2109,2.7681,3.5247,1.5707,3.7621,3.4547,2.2033,3.6368,0.089,0.3353,1.7352,0.2506,2.248,0.0007,3.7343,7.1198,0.1708,0.3397,2.1325,0.927,0.024,2.6342,5.9257,0.5841,1.4336,0.0012,3.1218,4.2032,0.6902,3.7564,2.9884,0.7472,3.4972,4.3928,2.4929,3.8892,6.5657,0.7062,1.1734,0.0358,3.1424,2.957,0.6458,4.3123,0.9501,2.4046,1.9839,0.216,2.59,2.7237,0.2481,5.7532,0.223,1.9393,0.9399,0.6864,0.2985,2.8007,5.4165,6.158,0.3459,6.1847,3.2722,1.4493,0.0567,0.538,2.7324,5.2964,5.9011,5.2448,2.6802,5.6998,2.6596,0.1955,3.4781,4.7092,2.3809,1.5305,2.441,4.6047,3.0292,6.349,2.2259,1.5839,3.3594,6.229,2.4852,1.9328,1.3602,0.2749,1.3031,7.4765,0.9078,3.962,3.4464,3.3477,0.0239,6.596,1.3335,2.0646,0.0002,2.1304,7.106,3.7175,7.1045,0.455,3.8897,7.3117,1.6332,4.42,4.1682,6.1084,5.5651,4.6963,0.0788,3.1167,0.4122,0.0137,2.1658,1.0867,0.4684,0.0195,1.0959,0.0514,4.5702,0.6628,0.0204,4.9681,3.6526,4.2428,0.8627,0.5015,5.355,2.2212,6.7239,0.0188,9.6694,5.367,0.6579,2.0803,2.6828,6.2059,1.8504,2.2276,6.142,2.1674,0.225,1.5049,4.5208,4.0705,2.5722,1.7416,0.9153,6.5885,5.3261,6.1388,2.5627,2.1177,4.1855,4.7785,1.2405,1.1234,2.5648,2.9954,5.1578,0.0316,0.9469,3.3778,3.8351,6.9704,1.0446,0.4491,5.6028,3.0426,5.0387,3.4018,4.7291,1.2288,6.5152,1.1147,5.2904,0.0376,4.8483,0.5774,2.8462,0.0002,0.006,2.8753,2.3771,3.0209,2.8644,0.927,1.0248,4.563,1.7513,0.6217,0.0002,1.7181,4.6441,0.1641,1.8797,3.4801,0.777,1.385,0.0002,3.1811,5.8739,0.272,0.6806,6.5978,1.1093,3.4888,1.5804,0.0287,0.0035,1.0244,3.5696,5.6418,0.0118,1.3589,1.4988,2.8466,3.3138,0.0118,0.4566,4.7301,0.4249,6.4701,5.5283,0.064,4.254,3.5376,0.5048,0.0843,1.8606,2.7872,3.4005,4.8852,0.3497,1.525,2.1703,1.4353,4.5018,1.9625,0.0071,5.3356,2.1788,4.8996,0.2937,1.3299,3.7069,2.5947,0.9609,0.0067,1.2585,5.377,2.711,2.0284,2.1777,3.7087,1.8639,1.9924,2.3393,0.0386,2.5667,5.5919,0.6157,2.7005,2.5146,2.2669,2.8723,2.6399,3.8952,1.5764,2.7413,0.062,2.7022,2.3701,1.8738,2.8738,0.0395,0.5816,1.7175,0.0002,2.433,0.0084,0.0019,3.187,1.1441,2.2929,1.5738,0.0305,0.7261,5.98,1.3352,5.4589,0.6078,1.4485,0.4596,3.5199,1.0482,6.3853,1.3426,2.1626,6.9476,1.4202,6.207,0.6184,1.802,4.2069,3.3789,0.84,1.648,0.9008,1.8053,1.9016,3.7058,0.6149,1.8051,2.3843,1.13,3.5103,0.0958,5.9722,1.3266,7.0107,1.1831,0.0829,1.7663,2.1119,2.2265,1.4626,5.0282,1.1945,3.9512,0.2054,3.2729,0.1516,4.5697,0.0014,0.0103,5.5232,1.1092,8.1686,1.5832,0.9002,0.0002,5.5882,0.9279,1.5916,23.1696,0.0624,5.9355,3.8022,5.9365,0.1901,1.7502,1.6605,22.4911,0.0172,1.5286,0.2679,5.7847,0.4591,1.1485,0.5538,0.0003,2.5591,1.1136,0.0004,3.282,2.5945,0.7326,0.0002,4.9358,0.656,0.5745,17.5081,7.3319,0.4582,4.5143,5.2039,6.1739,0.9449,2.665,2.95,7.4585,1.6134,3.76,2.9465,4.2908,3.3944,5.2638,5.3531,5.9229,7.8696,0.9056,3.2186,4.9021,1.7865,0.0564,1.435,4.8171,4.4525,3.7746,3.7862,3.4136,2.2784,0.3614,4.1695,0.0557,1.9198,6.9509,2.0887,0.0848,11.3835,0.7583,3.8512,9.662,1.0968,0.0003,3.7742,1.7752]}

No other state had challenged Singapore's sovereignty over the land, as they did in the past three decades.\n\nBut yesterday, the S$40bn (US$3.5-billion) court ruled in their favour \"and now there are no more disputes over sovereignty over the land\", the Times reported.\n\nThe case against Singapore, one of the countries that holds the sovereign rights of our land, and has held for some time, is based on Singapore' claim that its land has only two years' worth of human rights. To the contrary, the land that was originally claimed in 1999 and was used for agriculture as well as as a factory for the'sustainable agriculture project', was actually occupied by the Chinese.\n\nSingapore insists that the land that was reclaimed in 2009 has been utilised for the'sustainable agriculture project' in areas surrounding both the canal and Singapore's eastern canal. That includes the construction of the third canal connecting Singapore's eastern Mediterranean ports.\n\nLast year, Singapore issued a notice demanding that Malaysia must respond in writing to Singapore on how the land being reclaimed was allocated to the'sustainable agriculture project'. The court ruled that Malaysia will have to take more action.\n\nThe country has not yet responded to the Court's ruling. \"In fact, nothing is out of the realm of possibility yet,\" Mr Wong Seng said last week, when asked if he planned to file a legal proceedings.\n\nMr Wong also said that he was \"open-minded\" to the case, since he has argued in the past that Malaysia has the legal authority to assert its sovereignty.\n\nThe court heard last month that Singapore was keen to argue that Malaysia had lost its land claim. But a Malaysian court yesterday upheld the Singapore's claim.\n\nThe court, which said that the Land Use of Singapore Act 1991 prohibits the possession, use and transfer of land for the purpose of \"enhancing\" the value of the land, ordered Malaysia to respond in writing to Singapore. The court ruled that Malaysia will have to comply if it wishes to.\n\nMr Wong said that the Singapore case was \"far-fetched\".

{"id":2370,"ended":true,"length":465,"text":"The location of Kennedy's wounds suggested that his assailant had stood behind him, but some witnesses said that Sirhan faced west as Kennedy moved through the pantry facing east. This has led to speculation that the attacker had been hiding behind Sirhan in a cloak to protect him, or trying to hide his attack, while he lay at gunpoint.\n\nSargan died in an assault outside his father's pub in the capital city of Jeddah on April 3. The attack injured 21 and cost his father and other members of the Royal Navy and British forces in their lives and also resulted in the deaths of two other men involved.\n\nAccording to witnesses, two assailants were also shot dead by Sirhan when he got home from work but had not injured anyone because his wounds were deep as he lay at gunpoint.\n\nSources told The Independent that Sirhan's wounds were not the result of an accident during the attack. \"It was more than a simple accident. A person is always thinking that if someone is attacked, he will attack them,\" said a senior witness in the case. \"He was very angry because he wanted to kill all the soldiers, or at least his enemies.\"\n\nThis source said Sirhan was at home when the shooting happened, and when he reached the pub where his father was, he went for a walk as well as to get his coffee.\n\nDuring the attack, the assailant hit Sirhan at close range with a car blade as he fled, while other men ran towards him who got out of their vehicles but also ran after the assailant, who was still standing towards them.\n\nThe police arrested the assailant and charged a 40-year-old male man with eight counts of murder, and the two men each face charges of robbery.\n\nThe accused man confessed that he struck him in the head with a car blade to cover the wounded.\n\nSirhan suffered from a cut on his head. He was rushed to the Royal Hospital Jeddah for treatment, but the wounds suffered were serious, meaning that it took just weeks for Sirhan to regain his balance.\n\nSources said that Sirhan said that in the next 24 hours, as they were waiting for a response to call in his ambulance, he took his own life. However, he was later found by his brother and his aunt, who was still asleep when they found out that he had died. The two men are still in hospital, but were treated and released.","token_len":503,"entropy":[8.3463,0.7194,9.8417,0.9794,9.614,8.4482,1.1051,3.0963,5.2423,1.3883,8.4598,4.0054,1.0285,1.5933,2.7211,5.937,2.194,1.1403,1.9871,11.2821,2.2696,8.8073,9.5272,4.1615,4.0749,4.4481,4.1004,0.3798,11.1603,0.1605,9.4882,2.288,0.4531,5.0014,5.4738,2.251,1.0255,0.3808,0.2374,1.7088,2.9066,2.2549,1.4681,3.4757,1.4374,5.0794,0.0005,3.4474,1.9159,6.0184,3.5913,2.215,1.822,3.3679,1.5834,7.131,0.029,1.9476,2.9125,5.7785,3.8056,3.8939,2.6234,4.075,5.4422,6.3594,0.0608,0.7865,0.8353,0.0016,5.7764,5.4992,9.2884,5.4306,1.808,3.2573,7.0963,5.3678,1.7989,6.3033,0.018,7.2731,0.6708,2.6646,5.3731,3.4576,0.3142,5.9824,0.7903,0.001,1.2771,3.4039,3.3925,1.1992,2.5863,2.2479,5.1279,6.0072,2.7606,6.5463,3.1541,1.6025,3.3804,3.5158,3.5094,0.0191,1.297,5.1135,3.739,3.7211,5.4996,1.7826,4.492,3.392,1.8132,4.1466,5.1832,4.9137,0.0098,1.08,0.9837,0.0044,2.3716,1.3418,2.3889,6.4552,1.7113,0.6194,0.0002,4.6718,0.0018,3.7112,0.2531,5.6452,4.9211,2.4421,3.0748,2.6071,1.169,1.866,2.3328,0.0023,4.0226,0.8374,5.2189,5.605,1.0521,2.1069,5.8848,4.212,1.5945,6.6274,1.6315,6.4462,3.7522,2.8667,0.5526,6.2627,6.5251,1.5643,1.4788,2.2628,0.4477,0.0028,0.3734,0.7412,0.0002,5.3209,2.0615,1.6213,1.4576,0.3607,1.1591,0.0011,2.1217,4.1489,0.9471,2.0858,3.6391,1.0313,0.0009,2.0336,2.1727,6.1302,1.1023,0.9366,1.6341,3.838,2.3231,0.9289,4.8438,4.4388,1.0692,3.6872,2.2911,1.6364,3.8664,3.8307,3.1515,3.9739,4.8849,3.5328,3.4235,3.0849,1.8138,4.5983,1.3196,2.154,1.6048,3.6027,1.0494,1.4166,1.0498,1.7357,2.1821,3.9492,4.0948,0.9843,4.3706,0.2449,1.8523,2.107,1.5317,3.8106,3.7054,3.8699,0.5353,3.8975,0.3435,1.5847,3.8614,1.0944,4.152,2.5616,5.2304,3.136,0.0587,3.2998,5.2521,1.3484,0.1799,0.0002,5.458,5.7539,0.9154,1.5762,0.0006,1.5351,4.3314,1.3106,1.373,0.6725,1.8187,1.6393,1.7004,1.2833,3.7659,0.7676,5.159,1.3525,1.7552,2.5508,2.5057,0.5447,1.0872,2.8137,0.8888,4.4312,4.243,0.5234,1.0589,4.7191,3.8512,1.3661,2.1348,4.1595,2.8315,5.1907,0.5108,1.4045,0.0002,5.355,0.5566,2.0576,0.253,2.4751,3.2062,5.1769,0.6093,0.001,3.619,2.4665,0.0225,1.4894,0.4901,4.9773,7.7891,4.0379,0.4232,4.6683,2.0759,3.3919,4.6154,3.8155,3.276,3.1217,0.4324,6.3073,5.0164,2.1149,0.3417,2.0018,1.9108,4.2179,5.4512,2.324,3.3449,2.075,1.5123,1.8275,1.7656,1.2447,2.8362,3.1907,7.0125,0.9782,0.3418,0.5174,0.0002,1.7814,4.1189,4.5197,1.413,2.9996,1.6631,2.9479,6.5992,6.0823,0.0585,0.0094,0.0195,0.0007,3.8101,4.2671,1.0552,6.6321,0.1582,0.0419,1.8084,1.4515,3.6671,3.0244,3.3978,2.4629,5.031,0.5635,3.0341,0.1154,3.3195,2.1929,0.8238,0.0002,1.5731,5.4212,4.1924,6.8802,3.0412,0.3675,5.6514,4.3457,1.658,0.1503,1.2194,0.7752,0.1764,0.9688,0.7336,4.8296,3.9954,1.9264,6.8115,3.7882,1.3518,0.0002,2.2533,0.0008,4.7791,3.0517,1.6423,5.4754,1.0449,0.3277,2.4348,3.6055,1.4072,1.0924,2.0698,0.0472,1.8191,0.8499,4.4329,6.5903,0.0168,0.0006,3.479,0.5016,1.9711,1.0236,3.3213,4.3026,5.5218,1.434,4.1511,2.0599,4.6396,1.6076,3.7775,3.0149,5.9248,5.2132,0.6424,3.4315,0.0006,0.1709,4.1786,1.5383,4.0418,0.6951,0.3027,0.0002,3.8453,0.9848,0.9374,1.6054,0.0006,5.8701,1.1851,4.3291,0.9213,4.4833,3.7489,0.0202,0.9123,4.4111,5.1299,1.9115,4.092,0.3735,2.4764,5.0294,2.003,5.2585,3.3169,2.7344,1.7907,0.2283,0.9224,4.9218,2.1303,1.8306,0.0584,0.8138,5.2631,0.0496,1.895,1.7794,3.3688,2.1854,3.2521,1.497,3.9685,2.4473,1.9869,5.0808,1.8776,0.6495,3.8221,4.3326,4.551,2.1602,1.5742,2.7453,3.4687,1.4105,1.5118,0.4887,0.8123,0.258,3.7589,2.8988,1.3663,2.3787,2.8392,1.4609,1.4812,1.7789,1.159,3.7736,3.558,3.0064,0.3042,1.188]}

Its entire track was unknown, and its distance from Port Arthur, New Brunswick, Ontario, Canada Canada, was unknown.\n\nA tropical cyclone has the potential to intensify into a tropical hurricane by the time it reaches the Atlantic ocean on Friday, June 28, a day before Hurricane Hanna (October 4) makes landfall. The US-based American Samoa Meteorological Center (AMSMC) said the disturbance would make landfall along the coast of New Brunswick on Friday and that it was moving toward Puerto Rico by Saturday evening and moving quickly.\n\nThe storm had sustained winds of 25 mph (40 kph). It also has sustained winds of 30 mph (50 kph), as it approaches its first major hurricane - the Category 5 hurricane \u2014 off Florida. The hurricane is forecast to top out at 185 mph (270 kph) in the coming days, the wind that is estimated to have strengthened to a Category 3 by Friday afternoon.\n\nA further storm surge of more than 2 feet (3 meters) is expected to develop across southern New York state and northwestern Nevada and to the north, where up to 7 inches (17 centimeters) of water is forecast. The storm is estimated to be a Category 1 hurricane as well.\n\nA Category 2 hurricane is also expected.\n\nForecaster James D. Davis said the system is expected to bring a \"high volume\" of storm surge and winds of up to 35 mph (45 kmh). But Davis' warning does not apply to tropical storms like Hanna.\n\nHe said a tropical storm surge surge or winds near 30 mph would be a possibility by the time Hanna approaches the midway point.\n\nThe hurricane center said the hurricane center was warning Tropical Storm Hanna, with some minor hurricane warnings issued.\n\nMeanwhile, the storm center said Tropical Storm Hanna, with some minor hurricane warnings issued.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty low risk storm for us this afternoon along the coastline and the coast of New Brunswick,\u201d Davis said.\n\n\u201cAnd the next storm surge may be 20-25 feet (10 meters) below the center, where it is projected to be strong, and so it would actually cause some extreme flooding,\u201d Davis said.\n\nThe storm center also issued a warning on Friday at 2:58 AM, saying Hanna was a Category 1 threat.","token_len":503,"entropy":[5.3423,11.2998,1.7621,0.0251,3.1967,0.5796,2.3502,2.3273,4.698,1.1299,3.126,3.3982,0.9156,6.0786,6.3125,6.6837,1.3435,11.2117,0.0539,3.3851,2.4772,0.0238,3.1444,13.6009,2.3121,7.4773,0.6752,5.3117,8.5905,4.2506,0.8005,9.1988,1.6761,1.3917,2.7113,5.6631,0.9685,6.8479,2.3524,2.3558,3.3256,0.0943,0.6039,8.6255,0.7068,1.1339,11.6301,2.0513,0.7628,1.7871,0.2934,1.7031,0.0117,3.3311,2.8091,0.0519,0.0055,3.3947,3.0199,1.0119,0.1546,5.6281,3.9748,0.5252,1.16,2.6839,2.9831,2.1395,2.2437,0.7968,0.9667,1.0449,2.1865,4.304,3.6791,4.8302,1.1008,3.6394,3.4005,0.9475,5.2559,3.2508,1.6345,1.7809,9.4158,3.4394,4.7834,3.1458,0.7177,4.0162,0.0243,1.0144,1.8392,7.1692,4.0146,1.4137,4.5244,7.1167,1.0137,0.0218,2.3324,1.1589,0.6381,2.8954,0.084,3.1032,1.5086,8.8332,3.0372,3.9047,0.2371,5.1445,0.3333,1.8896,0.3307,2.6167,2.3626,1.3644,0.9546,2.8259,4.2949,1.2892,1.6944,4.9706,2.7,5.8557,0.0256,4.7226,2.209,3.6515,4.2067,4.2569,6.6597,3.6243,0.5606,0.0003,1.5206,1.4263,4.0456,4.0726,1.1575,0.1419,5.1484,1.2324,0.2952,2.6239,2.7399,0.0065,3.1143,1.8993,3.602,3.4354,3.9473,1.7949,0.1696,2.6391,0.1632,0.0193,1.81,0.0142,0.0001,1.916,4.4477,2.5672,2.2008,4.1565,4.8477,3.2467,1.5782,6.9399,1.4224,2.6475,1.2653,1.2269,8.2714,5.6198,5.1019,1.3748,2.2328,2.5633,1.5203,2.9885,0.0618,7.7507,3.7304,0.4149,4.4223,0.1838,0.0601,4.3966,0.0482,0.0001,0.7001,2.3322,0.8158,2.8756,0.2787,1.3224,2.7572,6.5796,6.1112,2.1913,5.9543,0.0694,3.0443,4.8584,1.2847,2.3753,1.5044,1.7843,3.976,2.5995,1.8581,0.2527,0.4034,0.0002,3.2994,6.1712,2.6245,2.1502,2.6548,3.1722,0.0087,3.2239,1.1615,0.302,2.7136,0.9426,0.0562,2.1368,0.3465,1.3354,3.7505,3.7818,4.3196,1.0651,2.2049,3.4764,2.0935,5.7001,7.604,3.1923,4.1939,3.5407,3.0616,3.014,4.5717,6.009,0.0101,4.3261,1.2923,0.3593,4.1154,1.62,0.0229,0.1118,3.391,1.7907,2.7488,2.8357,1.9008,1.2647,1.2197,3.3724,0.0267,2.0238,3.5267,0.4589,2.6665,0.9518,5.5567,2.0181,0.6112,0.3643,0.0002,2.9985,3.0165,2.0961,0.5844,1.0818,3.0988,0.919,3.9434,1.0345,0.0002,3.7994,4.0463,4.4075,4.3591,0.8899,6.142,1.6167,1.0366,6.4352,2.2886,1.0848,0.0091,3.7556,2.538,3.7005,4.4616,4.0051,1.15,0.0636,4.288,1.0357,2.4054,4.1166,0.9897,0.949,0.0079,3.8662,0.1285,0.0289,3.1782,3.5464,3.6149,1.1069,5.6951,5.2407,5.6587,4.0104,4.221,0.0232,3.7281,0.1407,3.7591,2.3488,3.9705,3.2264,0.9906,0.4218,0.0002,3.8747,0.5141,3.3532,2.5541,1.3885,3.7143,6.1578,6.2412,4.4256,6.2167,3.0358,0.0529,4.9265,1.1484,2.6627,4.6009,5.6551,2.1915,0.3843,3.2369,3.0673,0.8517,11.2215,0.0349,3.4699,0.6155,0.0002,2.0923,3.3724,5.2667,1.3201,1.3877,3.0318,1.4438,1.9675,5.9357,8.8116,0.1907,2.9934,2.466,3.6899,5.0948,5.2072,4.063,2.9408,5.1666,1.8753,0.8822,0.0002,5.6388,0.071,1.4913,3.5111,0.6005,1.0379,5.8382,0.2318,0.2729,2.8492,1.0627,2.0381,0.195,0.378,0.045,0.3977,2.0125,0.3856,0.0002,10.2768,9.2661,7.6275,11.7037,8.8697,3.2062,2.6351,6.9461,4.7206,3.4008,3.7725,2.2573,3.387,4.7423,2.8433,7.8018,0.8387,4.3129,3.2902,3.258,3.0289,1.631,0.4717,1.1912,1.4637,8.602,7.7411,10.6165,0.1858,0.2036,0.5406,0.0002,1.8252,0.7881,3.6655,2.882,5.0142,3.215,3.0684,4.8765,1.0774,6.6927,2.527,1.8969,0.6646,1.0142,1.8927,1.561,0.0625,4.5609,0.8404,4.1713,2.4549,6.0227,1.1697,1.7155,4.0999,0.0375,2.614,3.5877,1.909,2.4312,5.6131,2.5305,4.1415,7.6663,4.9135,2.3801,5.8477,2.1514,2.0269,2.2899,1.1125,0.691,0.186,0.0387,0.1826,0.0002,1.9399,1.2884,0.2097,2.3344,3.74,0.9904,1.3522,3.7382,1.8003,5.9547,2.9473,0.4418,5.0888,4.2924,2.1245,1.6938,4.3602,1.6536,2.5911,1.1372,1.8473,5.7749,0.9831]}

The firm has been offering protection programs for non-violent sex trafficking victims for years, and has increased their use of condoms and spermicidal anti-inflammatory sex products, which have been developed to protect against HIV infection and drug-related sex trafficking.\n\n\u201cLarimer Enterprises has been providing sex trafficking victims with the highest levels of risk factors imaginable,\u201d says Sara Brown, the group\u2019s vice president of corporate relations. \u201cThe company knows that many of the potential victims would prefer abstinence-only sex, at least when that\u2019s the only reason they have sex.\u201d\n\nThe report from Consumer Reports says the drug companies will continue to take steps to safeguard sex trafficking victims while providing protection for sex workers in this area of concern. The companies\u2019 ongoing efforts to educate sex workers in the U.S. about condom and syringe safe sex practices, including the use of latex condoms, anti-drug products and sexual contact-based contraceptives, are part of the company\u2019s ongoing efforts to protect female victims.\n\n\u201cWe believe condoms and syringes can be safe, effective and effective. We are focused on changing the standard for prevention efforts,\u201d says David Nee, CEO of Larimer Enterprises. \u201cBy doing so, we will be improving the safety of trafficking victims.\u201d","token_len":503,"entropy":[12.9148,2.968,1.3263,8.0196,0.4607,5.1018,1.0479,7.548,4.6442,2.0343,4.4712,0.2955,0.0393,4.0875,4.9496,6.8034,2.8104,0.9101,12.2438,5.694,7.0964,6.1155,3.4678,4.359,7.3958,2.0423,0.2792,0.175,5.0837,2.7213,6.7941,0.0057,7.9671,0.152,0.3511,4.2151,4.8221,1.0941,0.9311,7.2932,2.5879,2.9571,4.3389,4.5263,4.0516,7.1746,2.8036,2.8472,3.9826,0.6638,2.2196,0.2146,5.4339,15.2876,7.8449,1.7694,4.7225,0.9902,1.8459,2.3131,1.9773,5.5939,3.5496,3.9701,1.1878,0.1061,0.6789,0.0005,3.4795,6.0941,1.5576,3.3119,7.185,4.3206,0.9339,1.0872,4.1717,6.6274,6.4944,0.0135,0.9162,5.6466,5.0414,5.2295,4.8605,3.5571,1.9232,4.346,4.2624,3.4313,2.0176,3.3995,0.7385,1.6394,0.8724,5.8187,2.7864,2.7768,1.1975,1.1787,0.4477,3.2523,1.2334,0.5966,3.2775,6.6831,1.4406,4.4859,4.0625,0.9463,0.2164,1.3067,1.3388,0.9513,4.9527,1.8767,0.029,2.8453,2.7653,0.0218,3.0632,0.7905,2.2989,4.4894,0.0116,3.3197,1.7333,2.917,1.6078,3.7869,1.2001,2.5753,3.3315,3.0705,4.833,3.29,4.1608,0.4315,0.6175,0.0002,2.3899,3.68,5.4132,1.7953,0.0245,3.8336,0.1369,2.5438,1.2168,1.3998,5.9998,3.8999,4.4738,4.8503,4.0052,0.0027,6.3044,2.6227,0.9518,3.9238,0.4959,0.5229,3.296,0.0315,1.5509,2.4785,2.6093,3.0482,0.2821,5.9369,2.5479,3.0736,7.4802,0.3097,2.3258,0.8007,4.399,4.8986,7.0431,3.8561,3.9805,4.4248,0.7046,1.6648,0.1963,2.8694,2.3312,0.5924,1.9433,3.8464,6.1348,3.3485,0.2256,0.0671,5.9264,1.0705,1.1859,3.6461,1.7737,6.5445,0.0366,5.0113,5.6076,0.0146,5.3366,2.9987,0.4378,0.3913,0.0002,5.6606,5.9896,2.9832,8.9901,3.6528,2.8511,1.0682,1.9694,2.5253,0.1376,3.6246,4.3134,3.806,0.2796,6.15,1.886,2.5764,3.6938,1.9139,2.9449,5.285,5.0116,4.0878,1.2893,6.7,0.2673,3.7763,1.1768,1.4061,0.7866,2.1302,1.5078,1.1148,1.266,1.8153,6.0206,4.9717,5.1246,0.8208,1.8866,1.8828,5.8499,0.0183,0.0184,0.146,5.9785,0.0421,4.3206,9.1739,3.8078,2.6603,2.4554,2.3219,0.808,4.7346,1.7401,3.1437,1.6089,1.3965,2.4802,1.8225,6.5643,1.4689,1.4787,6.5344,0.9817,0.265,0.4938,0.0003,7.081,6.0005,5.163,0.2129,0.0006,2.4715,2.4142,2.2333,3.1344,3.8734,0.2486,1.0981,0.2577,3.398,5.358,2.5676,0.004,7.5086,5.5155,9.9478,1.3056,11.5194,6.3965,5.6629,6.5139,6.0081,0.3271,2.4303,4.9558,11.4404,1.5713,2.9012,2.4538,0.0291,0.8046,3.5929,3.7541,0.5224,6.2113,0.2676,2.0514,1.1129,6.813,0.8472,3.023,1.1242,1.1878,4.4921,1.0465,5.1998,3.0772,7.2856,1.9555,0.1381,0.7534,1.6259,6.6728,0.5059,3.1234,5.4024,15.4726,0.4362,0.2348,2.2287,1.2079,5.396,0.694,2.5896,0.6585,1.4593,4.0887,4.8098,0.6559,0.0002,2.5413,2.4668,2.1967,0.0852,0.0038,3.629,2.0364,5.1029,1.0672,4.1724,1.0799,0.0495,4.3662,1.6216,0.0516,5.7647,3.2461,0.3634,0.0875,4.9676,3.2056,3.2577,1.2636,3.3999,0.5548,2.9573,5.1374,1.8947,3.603,3.5749,0.3013,2.6482,2.7948,7.8424,0.2953,13.0972,0.6483,0.7473,3.4362,1.5429,0.1749,4.0692,1.4528,3.2708,0.0015,0.0071,0.3586,0.5766,4.9699,2.7891,4.0028,0.0176,4.5978,1.7862,1.8524,2.1621,2.7937,2.0587,1.5255,0.0197,2.9063,0.4647,0.5146,8.1137,0.0252,5.836,3.3889,0.8271,5.191,4.3675,4.7103,3.0236,5.1218,0.5219,1.432,2.2533,0.0019,1.3355,1.0201,2.9798,0.1345,0.0461,1.8168,0.3509,0.1619,2.0927,6.6057,2.1499,2.4009,0.4759,0.0003,2.2671,0.2571,5.7399,3.2011,4.7011,1.1202,1.1105,1.4483,0.0011,3.3645,1.0138,4.2268,1.9656,1.6654,0.4865,1.0936,3.1815,1.9861,2.2436,4.3587,0.044,5.8714,0.7794,6.7699,1.9995,5.6263,5.6047,2.471,2.0605,2.5549,2.112,5.062,5.5604,5.598,1.196,2.7898,0.3076,1.6139,0.0009,0.4181,0.2832,1.6965,0.1109,5.6446,4.2379,0.5915,0.1334,0.5782,1.1091,1.8114,5.5053,1.0528,1.1672,0.6527,8.7937,0.2374,2.5136,1.8299,1.5909]}

{"id":2423,"ended":true,"length":483,"text":"Prior to West Virginia's separation from Virginia on June 20, 1863, pro @ - @ Union supporters in western Virginia created unique flags to show their support for the Union cause. The Union flag on the Union flag is a simple, white text that can be placed anywhere, including atop of the Union, on the Union or on an inside of Union flag, the # UnionFlag. \"A Flag Flag \u2013 Flag & Flag Flag,\" the Union Flag is the official flag of the United States and the name, color, and number of the Union Flag is \"The Union Flag,\" a symbol of the US.\n\nSince 1863 Union supporters have created these flags in two different ways. One is by distributing them directly on American flag poles that have had Confederate symbols printed and decorated on them. The other is by holding them near the front of the Union flag poles and calling them \"A Flag Flag\" to commemorate a Confederate War soldier.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Civil Service Commission (USCCS), in addition to creating a flag pole pole, all flags must be placed at full power on the pole pole or poles with red and blue lines. However, in some instances, flag poles don't work for some purpose. At the same time, there have been instances where poles that have Confederate names have been found, but Confederate flags have not.\n\nIn addition to this, it is important to note that the flag poles do not have to represent any one state. To this end, the poles of flags that are set on American flag poles aren't only symbolic of America, but serve as a symbolic symbol of all that America stands for. Some poles are a symbol of the United States. The flag poles in these flags are also the symbols of each nation throughout the history of the United States.\n\nWhen it comes to placing this flag pole on the U.S. flag poles, it is advisable to choose a one-way pole. When the poles are placed around the flag poles of the States, the flags are placed vertically. According to the USCCS, the poles are best placed to do so. If the flags are placed at full power in the poles above the poles, they can be placed near the pole poles.\n\nIf the pole poles are placed on flag poles, the flags in front of the poles are placed vertically. When the poles above the poles are placed at full power, they can be placed near poles directly on flags placed by a Union flag pole.","token_len":503,"entropy":[2.7671,9.0662,2.0439,1.6297,7.4875,0.6713,3.88,5.1361,2.3794,3.2032,0.1818,6.8586,0.0911,8.4047,14.4035,7.8221,3.2382,5.4374,6.1516,3.2257,7.181,0.8504,7.3489,9.0909,4.3435,2.233,3.8502,1.4745,0.5727,0.3549,1.5386,2.2492,3.6421,0.6531,2.8977,4.0658,1.2221,4.2744,1.0698,4.207,0.9635,2.1661,2.0882,3.8493,2.104,3.1152,6.468,2.8535,4.1118,0.1904,4.1988,1.6054,3.3385,2.7503,5.9126,4.359,2.0294,2.1635,4.8044,2.7876,1.3802,3.2354,5.9792,2.6997,3.906,6.4621,1.1896,4.4131,2.5629,2.8421,4.2224,5.1831,5.7112,0.9979,1.8532,5.4655,4.9601,3.7275,7.479,6.8006,4.5597,4.9313,1.8547,6.8095,3.1156,3.7976,2.8312,0.6265,4.0282,2.0624,2.0746,1.949,0.3026,0.1172,0.5755,0.0241,2.4369,1.9785,5.1105,4.9139,3.7675,0.5153,0.5732,3.6589,0.123,0.5813,2.499,1.6451,3.1843,3.4005,2.91,1.5923,0.1756,2.4311,2.6958,2.9341,0.3611,1.1307,5.2717,2.3496,2.4944,0.0015,5.8032,3.6809,6.2354,2.9067,0.7255,2.2038,5.485,1.1977,2.5979,4.5821,1.4357,0.9984,1.1307,2.5036,0.912,2.6641,6.9226,0.922,4.5663,2.5207,6.1629,3.9477,3.6263,4.6282,2.4611,6.1276,5.1247,2.3585,3.7588,4.7264,5.0034,1.1177,0.203,0.816,0.6283,0.2378,0.4196,0.4467,4.1538,1.5789,4.9319,1.1318,3.6332,0.4078,0.7996,1.3143,1.2006,4.4974,1.7872,5.2056,1.2419,1.1663,3.5382,0.4142,0.3375,2.0747,2.5815,4.3147,4.3005,3.9959,4.8418,7.6418,1.1844,0.8892,0.0002,5.2879,0.0048,1.2864,3.3087,0.0474,0.0261,0.0044,2.695,6.7196,1.3926,2.729,1.2128,1.709,3.8314,0.3406,3.1599,3.4651,0.0107,4.4775,1.9403,1.1762,4.6707,6.6376,0.6812,4.2163,1.9201,1.8895,0.9465,2.4792,2.6944,5.9905,5.3002,1.8107,1.0832,2.4793,4.8681,3.3409,4.4587,3.2532,5.9845,2.3314,1.4575,3.8144,1.0803,4.9566,0.0447,2.7819,2.2963,1.7489,0.5478,3.7391,0.4653,6.8604,0.0017,4.6169,3.6742,3.8838,4.683,1.0315,6.2037,2.049,2.8149,0.0107,0.0974,3.5994,4.3601,0.0495,1.9028,0.5469,5.8068,2.0601,1.7975,4.1851,5.6035,2.0956,0.3858,5.7332,4.4501,2.2538,6.736,1.5597,1.2171,0.7476,1.3137,0.8851,0.0002,2.614,1.9577,0.4051,3.9353,1.4251,3.8839,0.3919,0.9992,0.1467,0.5147,0.1117,1.501,2.0227,2.298,3.7825,0.1287,1.1692,0.6053,5.3595,2.6547,3.85,3.3962,1.4188,5.051,5.4724,0.8593,0.1169,1.3747,4.6131,4.2034,3.0816,2.4406,1.4419,5.3736,2.3459,2.3963,2.0897,0.0503,7.8126,0.0016,4.4999,3.8981,0.8949,4.9932,1.1616,0.52,7.2248,1.0031,0.9231,4.3339,2.8209,0.5559,4.1599,2.6582,3.3554,0.5207,0.0054,0.217,5.5979,5.0969,1.5815,4.9836,1.5384,0.1433,1.6947,2.6698,0.0128,2.5225,2.9051,2.2344,0.7995,3.8058,3.0969,1.5032,0.9411,2.1777,3.4485,2.4815,0.3021,5.4708,3.9687,5.934,0.8649,3.2357,0.0202,0.2754,0.8308,0.003,0.3052,0.521,0.0002,4.5525,2.3764,0.0381,0.0268,5.4112,5.3062,0.5333,1.3366,0.8936,2.056,3.2407,0.0008,0.0008,0.0087,0.3026,1.8573,0.1987,1.5596,0.5711,5.5767,0.2075,4.7855,1.0052,6.3545,1.3479,2.5083,2.1608,1.7539,4.0288,3.063,3.697,0.4119,0.5414,5.9461,0.6095,1.9117,0.9564,3.241,1.1957,3.8942,0.5999,1.6058,2.2547,1.8839,0.9378,4.5435,1.8238,6.5289,0.0028,0.5665,2.0866,0.0766,0.0006,0.2523,1.7013,2.7739,1.6898,6.6047,0.2094,3.3885,7.1042,1.8046,4.0586,3.3506,1.2152,2.5123,0.5363,0.4046,2.6169,3.9792,0.1486,3.9073,1.1658,4.129,4.6844,0.5569,3.3891,1.2838,1.5801,2.4809,0.7326,1.1096,4.5842,0.325,3.8284,1.048,1.8251,1.1832,0.0001,2.9354,1.2794,2.9519,1.8766,0.6088,0.5233,2.0741,5.7424,0.1238,1.9744,1.4878,1.3728,4.4726,4.486,0.1776,0.6322,1.2375,1.3044,0.8624,3.1867,0.45,2.736,0.8732,1.3803,7.5818,0.1887,0.2679,0.1234,0.1984,2.7538,0.0531,0.0122,0.2702,1.3297,1.0842,0.0867,0.0782,1.32,7.1319,5.6573,2.825,5.4537,3.6812,4.4293,4.0641,3.4672,1.7228,0.3862,0.7859]}
{"id":1592,"ended":true,"length":485,"text":"A tropical wave move off the coast of Africa on September 5, and crossed the Atlantic waters, the Caribbean Sea and eventually into the Pacific Ocean as a weak system. An area of low pressure on the horizon was low enough to bring heavy rains and strong winds to parts of the continental US and the Pacific, while a low pressure off of the Equator, the largest oceanographic basin in North America, did not cause any major destruction. The wave was measured at 24 miles long.\n\nIn addition, one of the stronger tropical Atlantic systems this week was a system near Cape Cod, MA, and could be active later Friday. That system was tracked and measured as a tropical gale on Wednesday. The Atlantic wind direction was the same but had slightly slowed down because the wind strength was stronger. The Pacific Ocean will have more than its fair share of tropical showers, but a few spots could see tropical thunderstorms during the afternoon hours.\n\nWading deep into the surf on the Gulf coast and into the depths of the ocean is a serious risk right now due to increased pressure. The waters below the surf will have a chance for a few tropical storms and a few strong storms. The best chance to watch this system in the coming hours is Thursday night through Friday morning.\n\nThe next storms will be the ones that do not make landfall in the Gulf of Mexico early next week. That would mean more heavy rain and thunderstorms, although this will likely not bring any major damage. We remain well above normal for storm activity in the Gulf of Mexico, but for now tropical storm status remains very important. High pressure will become on the horizon and could bring a few storms and a few strong storms into the near future.\n\nWading deep into the surf on the Gulf coast and into the depths of the ocean is a serious risk right now due to increased pressure.

All the data collected have been recorded to date; however, no information was collected on whether the current cyclonic conditions may influence tropical cyclones.\n\nDuring a press conference on Tuesday, Hurricane Michael reportedly strengthened to a Category 3 storm as it left the islands of Puerto Rico and the archipelago of Van Guadalupe and Santa Teresa. Hurricane Michael is expected to cross the southwestern Bahamas and Bermuda at midday on Sunday, then move along the coast of the Bahamas near midday on Monday.\n\nThe BOMA warned that the severe rain, which will likely persist through Monday, could bring widespread flooding and flash flooding across many parts of the island.\n\n\"There are still risk for flood levels due to the ongoing storms, but the likelihood of flash flooding of the northern Bahamas could significantly decrease by Tuesday,\" the BOMA noted.\n\n\"The storm is expected to weaken into an area of strong high pressure that will move inland into Central Florida early Monday morning, possibly carrying a little less development. A tropical depression, while still developing, will remain at high latitude over Central Florida and northwest Florida. The storm will not weaken into a tropical depression but will remain located approximately northwest of Tampa at this level, and a tropical depression by the end of Tuesday.\"","token_len":504,"entropy":[8.9305,8.5444,3.9221,5.3686,4.2144,2.5792,8.6637,0.0212,5.4636,6.1568,4.534,9.0754,4.419,4.5965,3.7497,4.7268,1.4193,5.2475,0.5037,3.8433,1.9309,0.5138,4.8528,2.3302,5.4469,3.0192,0.5426,5.0217,6.18,3.1774,8.496,7.4918,0.5856,2.2696,0.0709,0.4381,2.5226,0.387,2.0199,0.2624,1.8795,6.472,6.4205,0.0028,2.2267,10.7606,1.6394,3.038,0.0978,0.0427,3.2534,5.1651,5.8273,4.8497,2.632,0.502,1.9648,2.1784,0.1034,3.3919,2.0402,1.0279,5.3574,0.1404,4.3315,0.7006,0.4462,2.2679,5.7303,3.1984,5.1342,4.3982,0.3285,2.1378,2.2502,6.2318,0.571,5.3655,0.0078,0.0022,0.4692,5.6616,8.0269,2.8818,3.5176,0.8535,0.0012,1.8737,6.1795,2.4319,3.14,0.454,1.7574,0.2177,2.8363,0.1374,4.5821,1.3767,1.597,1.2211,0.0021,5.4466,3.9736,0.0217,3.0874,4.8107,0.4319,3.6505,1.5409,4.1195,4.0706,1.8965,3.1233,2.5397,7.1029,4.9341,0.7022,2.385,0.6147,5.1867,0.9812,0.4193,0.0484,1.1296,2.4422,4.544,2.4498,0.8974,0.0091,1.8166,4.014,1.3852,0.0997,0.0034,1.2444,1.465,0.0003,3.9248,4.555,0.3385,1.5994,3.8039,2.2594,0.0026,10.5402,2.1357,0.7427,5.1806,4.609,2.6956,0.2948,3.2407,4.8465,2.7896,2.4967,0.0003,7.9428,5.3159,1.8431,4.4491,1.0808,4.5068,8.7708,0.6071,2.4948,0.0062,3.1241,0.6552,2.1718,5.1057,2.5233,0.3706,3.2765,1.7665,0.0016,0.0003,0.8888,1.5267,4.4731,4.0607,0.1858,0.2127,3.3276,0.8848,1.097,3.3568,1.9752,0.0069,1.6519,1.9978,1.7284,1.1683,0.3845,1.8973,0.1064,3.3104,6.6003,0.0006,1.9283,6.1482,1.9863,3.5534,0.617,0.0002,1.6399,4.5665,2.1874,2.991,0.9,3.6597,3.188,0.1142,1.8685,1.8456,4.3995,0.576,3.1091,0.4857,7.588,1.1228,3.7836,0.8594,2.9092,2.0397,6.8922,1.4163,3.2785,1.6098,4.1086,2.7885,0.4687,3.2905,5.6329,6.3407,2.7255,1.6333,0.0226,2.0399,2.2767,1.1021,3.3028,2.7186,0.7017,0.6356,2.0585,1.5891,0.0017,0.0021,0.538,6.5612,3.2909,4.9947,4.2291,6.5485,0.4132,5.651,2.7145,1.222,5.9384,1.889,0.0539,3.8998,2.8708,2.3032,4.1779,1.4848,2.7078,1.7094,4.3594,5.7055,2.1542,3.1864,3.6904,5.1637,5.1219,0.7506,1.1447,1.0353,0.299,0.0003,5.5763,2.5465,2.0766,0.3234,1.2813,2.2139,0.3279,4.6905,5.3681,7.4121,4.9301,1.9771,1.4006,0.7116,1.562,2.2159,4.222,0.817,4.8835,0.6094,6.3752,0.2133,3.1485,0.0664,0.4626,1.1456,6.7642,0.0076,0.0203,0.1385,6.9755,13.3491,3.322,0.0778,2.0949,5.1684,6.0126,1.1685,4.0339,3.2711,2.2862,1.7579,0.0161,4.7311,0.4722,5.1627,2.8638,1.8712,7.5546,3.2658,5.9584,0.7676,2.5461,1.3281,5.6887,2.5611,5.386,0.5997,2.3936,0.5175,1.292,1.7911,5.7869,10.1241,0.3408,0.6244,0.505,0.5592,0.0003,2.1074,5.6639,2.9772,3.3375,2.5546,0.6561,1.903,5.3637,6.1837,2.8354,2.0358,3.4073,2.8727,4.818,1.9725,3.1777,0.7483,1.0982,2.8997,4.1603,1.0169,1.2666,5.3632,0.3469,3.2493,4.3856,1.3281,0.0032,0.268,2.4872,0.8314,0.817,0.0003,2.3348,3.7423,1.4008,4.1187,6.3421,3.6723,6.2851,5.8944,5.1507,0.0343,1.4038,3.5275,4.7666,1.816,1.8782,1.921,3.7999,0.4724,5.5551,0.1602,5.1382,1.6911,4.7678,1.5199,4.5602,5.4975,2.4219,3.0403,3.2272,1.4762,0.5856,0.4407,0.008,0.0038,3.4922,0.2038,0.4254,0.0002,3.0453,1.8048,2.7432,1.7743,0.932,0.0139,3.9911,2.8896,3.4836,3.6167,0.5228,4.9346,5.4618,0.743,3.1366,1.4598,4.2128,2.1315,2.7674,5.9376,2.2468,5.0515,2.4066,1.1047,1.4582,4.0588,4.8487,2.4995,7.2856,4.041,9.0553,3.2971,3.5201,4.1347,3.7283,3.3439,4.5437,4.0816,3.721,0.6017,1.9968,3.6847,3.4953,3.3325,6.316,3.7309,4.8474,0.0481,1.7997,6.0865,1.2285,2.0902,1.975,1.8424,1.2442,4.7924,3.6805,0.9066,0.5599,1.7392,0.254,3.3579,0.5269,3.4439,6.3695,5.3354,7.3281,0.0533,4.3879,3.2366,4.0098,6.7067,2.6563,2.1827,4.1679,2.2953,0.6422,6.498,2.5547,1.5551,0.0019,2.5828,3.1049]}
{"id":1074,"ended":false,"length":490,"text":"In late 1967, an acetate of fourteen of Dylan's compositions was made, from which demos circulated among music groups who might be interested in recording some of the songs. Artists including Robert Wilson, Frank Sinatra, Lee Marvin and Billy Dee Williams were involved. \"We recorded the songs off the record, and they made two that night. It was pretty cool. We'd only heard \"A New Way To Live\" for an hour and a half so we didn't know the whole story,\" says drummer and singer John Paul Smith, \"but this set was very important for us to make a recorded and put it on playlists. That's what we decided we'd do. We decided we had to give the demo material to the other artists, and we chose them. We wanted to have them to remember those songs. \"\n\n\"There has never been a good time to record something with 'em,\" insists Dylan. \"We always do more than just record and put on the song. We had to make them as special as anybody else was willing to let us. That's all I've ever known about that day. But this set is my own, it's not mine.\"\n\nAs usual, Dylan takes his time and he always tries to keep his music as personal and intimate as possible. \"No one wants to do harm in their music, but you always have to get it right and be sure it's a complete product. \"\n\nThough nothing more than being a rock star whose career is long known and remembered, he's also been instrumental in bringing the band to life as a duo: their early shows together are both legendary- both in the form of memorable covers and albums. The songs \"No More\" and \"Sudden Death\" are the first two.\n\nThe songs are not only powerful but also have depth, too. Dylan takes to his guitar and sings from all four sides as the musicians work on each instrument. When the band comes together with their own unique sound, the songs bring the band closer to the audience.\n\n\"He plays the instruments very well. He's just a great musician and he's been doing it in the same way,\" recalls guitarist and pianist Gary Scott, who played on his own show, while his wife, Jenny, sang. \"It was an idea we had.

The last two colours and the two styles Sheg\u00e9's been working with have a similar consistency in his interpretation of the black colour scheme.\nSince Herg\u00e9's collection started in the 1940s, Herg\u00e9's designs have always been very personal and are inspired by both the British and French cultures. His style of texturing also shows his love for his ethnic heritage with a collection that aims to celebrate it.\nHis new collection, Herg\u00e9's 'classic', is inspired by the French heritage and is inspired by the British heritage. Her grandmother, Hisbert Herg\u00e9 (left), who died in 1967, has worked with British masters before, at Herg\u00e9's textile factories, and has been inspired by the British heritage with a collection of black & grey tints.

These shades were inspired by the French 'classic' black & black of the time, which is inspired by the British heritage. Sheg\u00e9's 'classic' black & grey tints are light, and look quite beautiful. They also feature a variety of bright coloured tints. Heg\u00e9's black & grey tints are often 'dark' tints. The shades 'hard' and'soft' look gorgeous on black black & grey.

{"id":3873,"ended":true,"length":480,"text":"The trailer for Ratatouille debuted with the release of its immediate predecessor, Cars. It depicts an original scene where Remy is caught on the cheese trolley in the restaurant's dining area sampling the rich, complex French dish. The action begins with Remy taking a bite of \"The Devil\", a large black, beefy potato made of cheese, and in time she (Remy) realizes it's the real cheese \u2013 and she quickly realizes it's the real chef \u2013 who runs the place. And after a brief, one-minute-long promo, this is when our hero starts to eat up a portion and makes it back to his restaurant.\n\nMeanwhile, we quickly learn from the trailer that the restaurant is currently on lockdown. A sign that there will be no more time to break free as Remy attempts to bring down the cheese trolley. The other key clue to her fate is that we'll be introduced to the true owner of \"The Devil\", which seems to be the only person who is actually going to make it through this ordeal.\n\nBut what if Remy decides to let everyone get away with eating the \"The Devil\". What if all the customers are dead and they only wanted cheese, don't care for beef, and prefer it if the meat was good? What if Remy (Remy Lissaudet, starring in \"Group\" ) decides to have an affair with the chef. If it turns out that the chef at \"The Devil\" is not being truthful about his love for cheese, how many movies could Remy use to make them do this? With Remy's betrayal, we can speculate that at some point both Remy-turned-cow-sitter and her lover will be dead and in mourning.\n\nAt the same time, though, we should consider that this might actually be the final scene in a film made of so many characters to put the end to a film. If the end comes sooner than later, what other possibilities are there that maybe Remy could give us the time of his life? But it seems doubtful. At this point we are left with the only thing to do is look for the next scene. This could be in the movie. In the future, however, if Remy finds out where she is taken, she may decide to tell her lover at the restaurant that her lover's love for cheese is very much alive. If she doesn't, she will be left with a few pieces of cheese, and a piece of her life will disappear forever.","token_len":505,"entropy":[10.1951,1.4569,8.6981,2.1545,0.0116,0.0003,6.5473,4.4274,2.078,3.1726,0.2139,2.4455,10.4319,2.9535,0.6895,8.8713,2.3618,2.6408,6.3089,2.7008,6.2104,6.2072,2.9254,8.2944,2.3544,5.0656,2.76,2.2337,11.2909,7.802,0.1527,3.0169,1.4152,6.0101,2.7693,3.417,1.9439,12.8336,1.7274,5.4058,2.3287,5.557,4.8291,4.8467,0.8781,1.7091,5.5017,3.8557,1.2078,0.6912,3.638,0.8084,2.4058,0.8415,5.8673,3.0423,5.2974,6.5665,0.8987,5.2759,5.7304,3.6731,4.3451,0.9211,6.3046,5.1164,1.8064,3.2274,1.4801,1.7731,6.3452,6.0031,6.8912,7.3563,3.7072,0.0379,0.1263,3.0211,2.2573,0.7281,2.6845,3.3885,4.835,5.3751,2.7041,2.2581,3.7561,2.3124,1.633,0.3637,1.4308,0.8333,7.5484,4.0736,2.4342,6.7265,0.7373,3.5312,0.6291,5.3093,4.7168,2.0305,2.5149,4.3193,5.8387,0.0713,3.5119,4.7187,0.2342,6.7589,1.1621,4.2447,2.094,4.4968,5.7744,1.5775,4.474,1.0649,4.5198,6.1219,3.8157,3.3286,4.5624,5.13,2.3327,2.7247,0.5822,1.5873,2.4863,0.7141,0.9725,0.0009,6.3696,0.1753,3.2924,5.9882,1.4249,4.0319,1.1493,1.128,0.2339,1.3742,2.562,1.2436,5.0228,3.7297,1.1169,1.4091,3.9134,6.1493,3.7492,7.6506,2.7313,0.0925,1.1677,2.2385,6.5178,0.967,5.8751,6.5624,5.3394,2.186,4.8304,0.0498,6.0297,3.47,0.2476,3.5881,2.1747,0.0307,1.2031,2.3969,5.4484,6.0273,5.0614,2.2969,5.2798,4.6993,0.5137,1.1163,4.0153,2.9733,1.92,6.0805,0.044,1.6768,6.1614,2.712,0.2008,5.4492,0.2654,0.2325,1.4398,4.205,4.9703,0.4649,0.5179,2.0456,3.278,1.8824,1.5084,3.3972,2.3866,4.3444,0.1378,3.4063,1.0035,3.1798,1.9733,3.1464,0.3499,1.0013,0.0002,4.1592,2.4646,2.0235,3.0561,5.0167,0.2945,4.4792,4.3528,4.4403,2.2264,1.2477,3.9585,1.3895,3.514,1.7422,0.0744,4.8488,2.5355,0.222,4.8395,1.2532,5.0763,1.8425,4.4824,1.6765,3.9498,5.1105,4.4294,4.0986,2.4737,6.1217,0.0361,3.4033,4.2985,7.1728,0.9295,1.185,5.7379,4.7145,5.7316,2.6499,4.1556,2.0703,4.3124,0.6831,1.2227,0.0845,3.3398,6.0616,2.5472,0.0437,6.912,5.718,7.917,7.3274,2.5886,6.2109,0.7674,3.243,11.8419,4.9633,4.3943,1.6937,0.2715,4.7642,3.9719,2.8739,0.0988,1.3507,3.7897,4.6007,4.0774,3.7758,1.6561,0.01,0.813,1.3267,2.6108,6.9033,2.9508,0.1706,0.0086,0.0388,0.9678,3.1496,5.6359,2.7132,2.1963,1.0991,4.5142,0.6236,1.4343,0.4038,3.0446,3.5802,8.0165,2.8742,5.1101,6.0257,0.6166,2.4424,5.8195,4.4058,1.5457,0.3748,5.8833,3.1376,1.1042,6.6227,0.9307,1.9529,2.4401,5.4382,1.1463,5.041,1.2649,0.034,6.6654,2.2519,7.1014,6.6554,0.0142,5.0771,3.8835,4.6873,2.6548,1.7365,2.2225,3.2672,1.0877,1.4899,2.7507,1.7011,5.0698,5.4249,0.4783,0.6468,0.0002,4.9463,1.3022,1.6606,0.0047,0.0905,4.3637,0.0524,1.3501,4.2338,5.2882,1.1516,2.5893,4.4496,2.957,0.3369,1.2998,3.2318,2.2053,1.0134,2.7556,4.0016,5.1853,4.4978,6.1148,0.4151,2.9646,5.0753,4.9703,1.9742,5.9263,1.7584,2.0451,2.8849,2.0356,3.5445,2.1195,4.3148,4.2347,4.0648,0.5981,0.4051,0.1714,4.5683,4.7005,2.2583,2.575,0.1942,2.5634,6.1398,3.023,1.9271,5.5454,0.7238,3.4549,3.9708,2.7582,6.8893,0.1147,1.0173,5.2328,3.4741,2.3589,5.1302,2.9196,4.6496,1.2577,0.1309,2.347,2.8871,1.5459,0.582,1.6614,4.9069,3.0286,2.711,1.1555,1.8942,4.7476,1.3348,1.4017,3.8523,2.642,1.7297,5.2291,3.021,0.7946,4.8508,0.9906,3.5847,4.3294,4.2446,1.2165,3.8656,0.4257,5.5678,0.0133,3.4605,1.4267,4.4834,1.1894,4.8078,4.2669,1.1383,7.3888,0.9672,1.9429,2.2581,3.1648,0.2893,4.8054,1.9723,2.414,5.8728,1.1984,3.9261,1.6525,3.2544,2.8808,3.4538,3.4517,0.8353,0.1967,0.7064,6.0743,1.9009,0.7127,0.8953,3.5555,1.2081,2.5919,0.0005,0.5392,1.5785,2.0835,1.6447,2.7331,1.3206,2.2385,4.0634,6.0345,0.144,0.8364,2.3736,1.7108,3.3019,4.2306,0.0467,2.4057,2.6533,3.6342,5.705,2.311,0.177]}
{"id":67,"ended":false,"length":481,"text":"All of the novel's storylines concern memory in some sense or another. The most apparent confrontation of memory is on the part of Urania Cabral, who has returned to the Dominican Republic, where she is known as \"the mother of all children\" (according to \"The Motherless\"). The story, in its central setting of time, also explores time itself, the meaning of which is \"A time of love\" which is an important reference to the story of Love and Time.\n\n\"In a time of despair, there is power in this,\" M\u00e1rio said during a conference call on the theme of \" memory: The Story of Love.\" \"It is a time of peace and light. One man can turn from the place of misery to the place of light.\"\n\nM\u00e1rio said to this end he spent some one-on-one time with a woman whom he recognized as \"the mother of all children.\" He described them as \"people in many states of distress, and that is in most areas of the world.\"\n\nOn the face of it, the incident shows how love can have a positive impact in a short timeframe. However, in some ways it can be a difficult time for some people. At the same time, he said, \"a woman who has lost everything is a very, very strange situation.\"\n\n\"I wish I had an answer to that problem. If it were possible, the answers would come in a very short time,\" he said.\n\nThe theme of Memory has been emphasized throughout the conference, which includes an hourlong lecture on \"The Motherless,\" on the story that inspired the \"Motherless\" film.\n\nM\u00e1rio praised the movie's dialogue, and the way in which the story was shot.\n\n\"This film is very honest and it shows the emotions of so many people,\" he said. \"I want everyone to know there are others who have died. And I also want everyone to understand that there is only time for us to be happy.\n\n\"This is the only memory that is true of the mother.\"\n\nM\u00e1rio also praised the \"Motherless\" movie. \"A film like this demonstrates that if you're a father, you're not alone,\" he said. \"But you are.\"\n\n\"What matters to me, the biggest thing is that when you watch a movie, with your friends and loved ones, is a relationship that you can live without any matter.\"","token_len":505,"entropy":[3.4238,1.5137,9.1094,1.1031,6.8611,6.6642,9.9054,4.8242,4.968,3.7061,3.9897,0.1976,0.7834,2.2075,4.4516,6.2332,8.3751,3.2225,5.1283,1.2498,5.313,0.8108,4.9414,0.0057,11.0276,4.7457,11.5203,1.8637,0.6467,1.3981,2.7304,5.354,0.7547,1.642,11.0022,0.0785,2.417,1.7349,0.4182,1.9845,6.2443,0.6328,1.7293,1.7836,4.1707,0.2352,2.0748,5.0076,2.5556,1.6457,5.6059,0.0025,5.5141,1.2634,3.4805,4.805,2.7565,2.251,2.6726,3.9677,2.718,2.7853,6.9513,3.5465,3.2236,6.5449,2.4245,4.2863,4.181,6.2994,2.2444,1.0862,3.0428,4.8224,0.185,3.5364,0.7882,4.9037,6.8545,2.4875,1.6781,4.323,2.4504,5.0123,1.6022,4.7544,2.731,5.7354,0.9394,0.953,4.202,0.8255,5.754,1.2714,4.7847,0.797,1.139,0.0044,4.5845,4.5374,3.2298,2.3106,0.4562,6.701,0.7452,3.3257,0.6216,6.8262,1.6409,4.4665,3.9754,5.8394,3.8853,2.3923,2.9064,4.4924,1.2809,5.1749,1.6883,2.9646,1.7514,4.9593,0.7309,1.929,10.9453,4.2403,2.7684,6.0235,0.0906,2.3066,3.4606,0.6182,2.221,0.8999,1.8367,2.0804,0.4415,4.4042,1.401,5.126,1.603,5.3851,4.6205,2.7947,4.8912,4.3082,2.2569,6.4091,0.6311,5.31,1.6402,0.5319,0.0393,0.0123,2.9198,1.3711,0.7533,0.0002,2.3146,0.0577,0.0003,1.9996,6.9215,5.1266,2.3728,2.4455,6.6471,3.159,8.0678,0.4567,0.829,0.0006,0.0077,0.1138,0.3698,3.5617,3.3828,4.0917,0.1512,5.3078,1.0814,2.3828,1.4998,1.1453,0.2517,0.124,0.0707,0.6506,2.5371,2.8739,5.2351,0.2621,1.0073,6.1018,3.7201,5.462,6.1545,0.3355,3.5774,2.2155,2.6396,4.6763,1.2129,4.6951,5.5537,5.5741,0.5135,0.5654,0.5303,0.7274,0.856,0.0002,4.8754,1.2915,5.6663,0.0024,0.0288,0.1363,1.6813,7.0997,5.4521,1.8177,5.3631,1.2908,3.4813,1.1647,3.6502,1.039,2.782,2.0248,5.4436,4.8951,0.7297,4.8595,0.0516,3.3376,3.2294,1.4296,1.2293,2.3175,1.3652,1.8584,5.0052,2.2294,0.9809,3.922,0.9104,1.0024,5.5539,1.5069,0.9784,0.0101,0.1064,5.7683,0.5154,0.3278,1.9484,4.3293,3.9911,1.5559,1.9459,2.2487,3.6613,2.2681,2.4353,3.1361,3.6623,0.0045,5.4207,4.917,0.9767,0.4081,0.0002,2.1784,2.0864,5.063,1.1548,1.6799,4.1223,2.6021,1.1545,1.1429,4.924,2.7209,3.7418,2.8629,1.8364,2.463,0.8783,3.957,4.4527,0.5157,2.9675,2.2004,2.1489,1.748,1.6677,0.4387,0.8061,0.9273,0.4381,0.2172,0.9082,0.0001,2.4139,4.5757,0.2477,5.4467,2.9433,1.1794,5.9942,2.3611,0.4868,8.4034,1.4772,2.6577,4.497,3.5865,3.437,1.9284,3.7933,1.6647,2.4598,1.9533,3.1468,0.0671,1.3487,4.3749,1.4463,5.0074,5.4907,3.8702,1.0414,4.0579,1.1058,0.1893,0.6037,3.662,1.6841,0.9696,0.0002,2.2112,0.1367,0.0002,6.3675,0.9866,3.4711,1.6994,5.9012,1.0457,2.7419,2.3696,2.9419,1.9237,0.0005,1.5527,2.3639,2.6897,4.663,0.7838,1.2018,0.0001,0.4032,3.1674,2.4991,1.0818,2.1438,6.3881,1.4511,3.1662,3.6671,1.7632,5.0758,1.0337,6.1068,0.0093,0.3863,1.2783,0.2588,0.028,0.1133,0.254,2.3535,3.3355,4.6447,0.2045,1.9218,4.0552,1.2845,5.0811,0.8933,1.8641,4.5483,2.1818,2.7842,1.7893,3.3274,0.2144,2.0288,0.1006,3.1189,0.6366,1.8734,1.317,4.4605,5.1589,0.9857,3.9419,0.4139,2.8699,2.3832,1.3265,2.7725,0.0001,0.1168,2.96,1.1138,1.8995,3.0928,6.4729,1.2212,2.2896,3.9998,4.0505,1.9465,3.4949,4.2978,0.6597,0.0002,1.9018,0.0471,0.0003,2.1305,3.0777,0.5428,3.2595,1.7385,0.0937,0.1251,2.1209,2.2358,2.0851,5.066,2.9062,2.0197,0.5255,7.7115,1.373,4.7649,0.9222,3.7074,2.4102,4.8232,0.8115,0.6478,2.0089,1.5204,2.7304,1.2884,0.0631,0.0379,0.1137,0.2605,3.6585,2.7245,3.1165,7.0396,0.372,0.0001,1.873,4.6893,6.1025,2.212,1.0926,2.9049,3.0899,5.7666,1.322,1.573,1.1198,4.458,1.2593,4.3691,3.8736,1.1581,1.8232,5.9588,3.2979,3.6323,1.1212,4.2629,0.0166,0.2875,3.8336,4.4518,5.1573,1.5511,2.3292,1.9602,2.6862,4.3516,4.3001,5.9756,3.4578]}

{"id":2350,"ended":false,"length":483,"text":"Some bacteria also transfer genetic material between cells. This can occur in three main ways. First, bacteria can take up exogenous DNA from their environment, in a process called transformation. Second, bacteria can transfer DNA between itself and cells, in a process called microglia. Fourth, water can get in contact with a small number of genes in a cell, so bacteria form their host cells. But now another factor can be involved. Scientists at the University of Cambridge have discovered the genes that can transfer DNA between cells. This is called the DNA transfer chain. It allows the transfer of genetic signals to and from DNA-containing cells. That means that DNA and DNA molecule transfer from one cell to another. To explain this, researchers from Cambridge have identified DNA in three cells. Once in each cell, they then sequenced the whole genome of one cell - or a single gene \u2014 to provide the transcription factors responsible for the DNA transfer. Scientists have developed more efficient methods to do this in the lab by studying bacteria and their DNA molecules. These methods include gene transfer, RNA transfer and DNA-binding. When the genome is translated into RNA, the DNA molecules can form a DNA bond. When these DNA bond strands separate, they give the bacteria and their DNA the DNA-binding specificity needed to make the cellular transformation process.. Scientists developed a way to achieve DNA transfer using RNA transmembrane transfer. In this way, the bacteria take advantage of the ability to divide without needing specialized machinery. In both cases, the genes of the bacteria are able to be transcribed for transfer of DNA. But when this DNA bond is needed, the bacteria are at risk for DNA splintering. The scientists found that the ability to transcribe DNA between cells by the way of RNA transfer, was impaired. This causes this link between bacteria and DNA and allows the transformation of DNA into RNA. Scientists then developed a technique dubbed DNA transfer. Using gene transfer, the researchers were able to transform DNA inside the cell. This allowed the bacteria to transfer DNA to and from cells. But they were unable to do that in vivo. This is so important that their researchers need to get their labs tested for DNA genetic engineering. In 2013, they were allowed to start testing the development of techniques to test for DNA genetic engineering.\n\nExplore further: Scientists discover key genes that protect DNA against DNA splintering\n\nMore information: Science & Technology News, 27 March 2015 Science & Technology News, 27 March 2015 Science & Technology News, 27 March 2015","token_len":506,"entropy":[10.8398,5.544,7.383,6.1355,1.5711,2.9907,1.9583,1.6017,2.5422,2.4862,3.1353,1.5488,5.9516,3.967,0.3979,1.2459,1.3976,0.0667,1.7534,1.6273,3.9802,1.5886,8.2058,0.3939,1.7764,1.2733,2.5377,3.2009,1.3576,4.3503,2.588,1.6741,0.4656,7.5094,0.4288,2.1272,0.0048,0.6879,0.8128,3.1399,1.8171,1.8689,6.2759,0.1097,3.2566,1.5234,1.7873,0.4758,0.202,0.0818,5.623,3.4665,1.603,0.7565,8.4548,0.0686,9.4092,2.7052,5.7126,2.6456,3.5324,0.0126,4.1585,5.5158,1.4381,0.0063,3.8969,1.9237,1.8917,1.0151,0.9784,3.4294,1.8339,6.7741,4.568,8.4272,0.8086,1.1501,5.224,6.8122,6.7582,3.8427,3.1467,1.5183,1.4792,1.4612,3.72,3.2668,0.7003,0.6707,0.0073,2.9737,0.8179,1.6923,3.5664,4.4175,1.0847,3.355,4.6237,1.4359,0.1999,1.2707,0.7657,2.4639,1.7491,1.3837,2.9447,5.501,3.8362,7.2379,0.597,3.0426,3.7688,2.3826,3.2727,0.0343,2.1177,8.3203,2.6865,4.0806,0.0465,4.7086,3.8101,1.7309,0.5357,0.5316,4.9989,1.7634,0.9028,3.7366,4.2625,3.4806,6.0355,3.4808,3.8578,0.4511,0.5998,0.1441,0.1549,1.0465,5.3248,4.5702,1.4084,0.9456,2.1445,1.821,1.5017,2.3579,3.3578,4.6581,3.315,3.588,4.147,1.6993,6.4772,3.1611,2.6087,0.5766,0.1433,1.5161,3.5731,5.2182,0.1504,0.7755,5.0922,0.784,0.6343,3.0924,2.0385,5.9475,4.4687,3.1531,2.0047,2.4542,8.6192,1.8297,7.0828,2.5336,6.6399,2.7696,5.1812,0.0086,1.3432,2.463,2.0392,0.2404,4.1582,1.6661,4.8609,4.1658,2.7355,1.7079,0.817,3.6926,0.3267,3.7123,1.6005,1.1755,4.6089,3.3893,4.4876,1.9508,2.815,2.3622,3.1214,0.3606,3.6934,1.7959,2.497,4.1791,2.0727,1.3721,3.6102,3.0391,0.9,1.9301,2.6523,2.1469,2.0918,4.6247,2.029,5.034,1.0646,3.6109,1.353,1.7577,0.2887,1.2569,2.0743,1.8703,2.3743,4.688,1.3748,5.5786,4.0893,1.2543,2.4316,3.4956,2.2855,4.4184,7.516,6.4418,0.3276,1.2042,5.6923,3.4554,2.5206,3.4185,0.9494,2.1999,2.0548,3.2264,3.2761,0.0607,8.3308,1.6723,0.2855,1.9469,1.3158,5.9268,6.1569,3.8787,10.7516,3.7406,5.4113,1.3159,2.0445,0.2472,5.4807,3.6096,1.857,2.712,2.6173,6.5403,6.8469,0.0015,0.0763,4.7525,0.9626,3.0596,0.9194,1.2012,0.0711,1.1982,2.0886,5.7767,4.8782,0.0008,0.7863,3.6356,1.5283,5.1987,5.817,3.9456,7.0272,1.508,0.7235,2.8456,6.6839,0.6532,0.064,0.6953,4.6747,3.4049,0.309,1.8752,1.3334,4.9417,0.0014,2.0493,4.7625,0.0004,4.9547,4.4311,3.2523,1.5823,1.4132,4.0462,2.4246,3.0424,2.9574,3.5064,0.6724,5.6974,0.5292,0.9096,1.1225,2.7949,5.8998,1.6662,2.4395,2.4091,5.2123,6.0091,0.6074,0.6617,2.139,2.966,2.7926,0.2329,1.6945,3.9826,0.3987,3.4122,0.0064,2.1264,3.4661,0.9978,6.1128,3.8868,4.293,0.7291,1.3042,3.9011,3.5619,3.4891,6.5774,1.985,2.3193,6.0845,5.4318,7.3159,0.4073,3.0231,0.0445,1.348,4.1799,3.4998,1.6434,3.1265,0.8077,1.0685,1.6591,0.4863,0.5301,3.1172,5.4428,1.6833,0.6773,3.0947,8.1922,1.9871,3.3787,2.1597,3.6932,4.3486,0.8793,0.6276,1.1635,1.3111,3.5196,0.0043,0.0024,5.2096,1.1181,6.4812,2.0577,1.639,2.6513,1.6396,2.5906,0.6676,0.611,0.1429,3.2879,1.2354,2.8163,2.0579,0.0485,1.824,1.3222,2.4546,3.2819,2.1832,2.1234,0.0033,1.735,3.3218,2.0829,2.8142,0.6526,2.4973,1.6924,6.4599,2.909,0.8317,5.7546,3.8765,4.534,0.2726,4.2169,2.7753,7.7621,4.6197,2.5679,2.6337,7.2105,3.6786,0.5446,2.8982,4.676,0.116,1.4502,2.8587,5.5994,0.0637,4.0533,3.2011,1.828,5.663,0.0449,6.3928,1.2956,5.4042,2.0222,0.7045,1.8875,0.0514,0.5362,2.9408,0.033,4.2882,0.0051,0.0012,1.906,2.0476,5.1543,1.1615,1.411,5.4495,3.0775,3.0702,1.76,1.1398,0.1213,0.1836,0.7299,0.0002,0.0006,0.0003,0.0088,4.7722,7.2112,2.3044,2.7183,0.6463,8.3907,2.8055,2.0913,12.2501,1.6806,0.2327,0.4041,0.5805,1.3282,0.0516,0.0555,4.6654,0.1257,0.0191,0.0266,0.1497,0.5157,0.0045,0.0141]}

A highly detailed account of the plot and the assassination is provided by Suetonius, who alleges that the plot was planted by the then-leader of the \u201cCivitus gang,\u201d Pius V, and that while he was still imprisoned, he had killed another politician, Aylion de la Cruz, and attempted to assassinate his mother-in-law, Nysia de la Cruz; he later published documents alleging that he had recruited the young actress M\u00e1rio de Jardim to help him.\n\nHis motive for seeking notoriety was to get attention as a female version of himself in an Italian TV drama series, Aravadi, where he won a Tony Award for his portrayal. He later confessed to having done so in one of his previous shows, a series about an Italian aristocratic family led by Pietro Marziani, which had run in the Italian state for half-a-century. At the time of his death, the series was airing in the U.S., and was adapted by Pia De Laurentiis for British television. Aravadi premiered in 1985 and starred in several movies, and was later the subject of a popular TV series in the U.S.\n\nFollowing his death, De Laurentiis devoted part of his estate\u2014to his wife\u2014to the arts. At the peak of his career, De Laurentiis and her daughter Elisabeth of Salerno set up a charity called \u201cNoccea,\u201d with which they donated 20% to the school for the deaf and hard-of-hearing. The foundation has been in existence since 1991. In the 1990s and 2000s, the foundation also supported young children\u2019s programs at school and university centers in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nAnnie is featured in the 1989 film, Aravadi.\n\nHe was also engaged to another actress, Agnes Milano. He divorced her in 1985. His marriage was briefly separated in 2002, when their divorce was finalized. The couple was married in the same year. In 2007 they were allowed to start a family during the financial crisis, but they divorced in 2008.\n\nIn 2012, he married Italian poet and filmmaker, Ciao Maria, an Italian actress. They moved back to Italy in 2014. In August 2019, Agnes Milano announced a pregnancy via social media.","token_len":507,"entropy":[5.8384,5.0591,4.6181,6.4044,2.5029,5.0131,2.8302,11.2996,1.4308,3.5048,2.2529,5.4892,7.2788,6.1543,0.1497,10.4533,2.1686,1.3582,4.0644,7.211,4.964,1.9946,0.357,0.677,2.9522,3.5103,1.2257,3.6116,1.7782,3.3742,1.9387,7.4295,3.9886,0.0328,1.3708,1.3635,7.7075,0.2339,1.5384,4.3735,0.9985,5.7223,0.4795,1.5494,5.7868,1.3256,3.2253,0.1695,0.3886,13.2168,6.0213,3.443,6.454,5.9499,7.6656,0.9618,8.3736,8.8535,7.1484,1.1838,3.0702,0.8991,2.293,1.2026,7.0014,2.0247,0.7242,3.0571,4.9737,1.0023,1.5494,3.8335,6.3173,5.0594,6.2131,1.4125,5.8117,7.9313,5.9387,5.3288,6.2408,4.6834,0.742,2.0259,5.2912,0.0778,0.928,3.2103,3.8848,3.3373,0.009,0.0048,0.0014,1.5451,6.2447,7.6495,2.4939,1.813,1.214,0.3164,5.6752,2.5313,3.5879,4.7819,5.9425,3.9705,0.3631,1.4838,0.4826,5.7991,1.7855,5.0209,6.3926,5.7314,4.6169,3.662,1.9762,6.509,2.1707,2.1088,1.5887,4.0273,0.3873,2.8649,1.7815,0.0011,6.568,5.7694,0.7514,5.8366,6.7667,0.939,1.9117,4.3246,3.0476,5.2849,0.6107,5.9413,6.9327,0.0098,1.9401,3.0463,3.9573,4.5829,4.049,2.5299,4.0442,1.5593,5.2094,8.7531,9.9778,1.9944,3.7861,0.6013,6.4791,1.7105,4.763,1.2219,0.5987,1.6871,1.5555,4.185,2.1371,3.3564,5.9295,0.5762,2.1129,4.9503,2.0323,1.7642,4.6704,0.2265,1.0842,5.7505,4.2114,0.5467,4.4065,3.26,2.0621,3.0958,1.8308,4.8933,2.8877,1.466,5.8295,0.0108,7.7607,0.0354,5.2191,4.1936,2.8555,0.9835,2.8027,3.3956,4.4648,2.6061,2.2805,1.3297,3.3927,1.8087,6.4087,4.9623,0.3651,0.0066,0.1381,0.4772,5.0019,0.4228,0.3383,0.9883,0.6249,0.8157,0.2588,2.3258,3.9312,0.699,3.6345,0.9828,2.3531,2.0237,0.002,0.1231,0.8123,1.2815,2.9373,5.0453,1.5729,5.4716,2.4899,5.4826,3.0088,0.0065,0.0004,2.4804,6.4319,0.619,0.4805,3.712,1.5787,0.0089,3.785,0.5892,4.9153,1.5498,3.6607,3.0293,2.9493,4.2737,1.1955,3.1884,1.5319,3.3424,5.7244,0.983,0.0038,0.7682,4.6817,2.5587,0.8796,2.6699,1.3074,0.3299,0.0006,1.3894,0.5548,1.9171,0.0002,5.3806,0.6464,0.4343,0.307,5.8769,0.0215,0.002,0.0002,6.4683,4.116,0.0021,0.2431,4.704,5.8193,4.7625,2.1424,1.6092,3.7293,0.038,1.7562,5.6459,1.2448,4.5872,0.5805,6.005,0.0104,0.3899,2.6582,0.1855,1.9973,0.005,0.0035,0.0003,4.8502,4.6306,2.7017,5.3534,1.1766,0.2375,6.9207,5.4803,1.1798,6.9216,0.282,0.6317,4.5633,2.1979,7.7453,2.0724,4.7877,5.964,4.8099,4.3211,3.3357,3.4823,2.6052,4.2216,1.7771,1.5324,2.8747,6.0097,2.2906,4.1691,1.2314,6.0596,4.2455,2.3092,4.4233,1.5363,2.86,1.1405,0.1219,0.0045,0.0006,0.0031,1.4132,2.0978,2.8346,3.5969,2.0244,3.182,1.8574,0.6107,3.5368,1.0271,2.5852,3.2052,2.6927,0.0196,3.7392,0.9132,0.0018,0.1533,1.7731,1.8028,4.0027,4.1723,5.8268,3.2687,10.2864,6.71,4.6253,4.7435,2.855,3.6217,1.7911,4.8168,4.2675,1.5281,2.0809,0.919,0.0007,0.0702,0.9783,0.5063,1.8257,0.5017,0.9481,0.0002,5.5514,5.3844,5.0676,5.3676,0.4769,1.4376,6.0306,1.2695,1.932,2.9878,4.3293,0.0265,1.5531,1.0224,0.0002,5.3022,1.3339,2.1546,5.9142,0.2888,5.3583,1.7752,0.6966,5.5124,0.4088,5.8775,2.1465,1.361,3.4958,3.8339,0.7718,0.5205,4.8613,1.5431,3.7648,3.2037,2.156,6.0445,3.4808,1.1212,4.0258,0.9291,1.2008,5.29,3.1507,1.2889,1.0126,0.4464,2.9984,0.6379,3.6897,1.816,0.708,3.3308,3.1006,3.1738,1.4444,2.6452,3.2573,4.884,2.5463,7.3802,0.1685,5.2626,0.6423,2.4323,8.2842,1.5176,6.328,0.5949,1.6059,1.5144,2.4055,2.9331,0.8521,1.9885,0.4391,1.0799,0.0002,1.8144,3.0182,0.332,1.9795,2.861,6.3319,5.7563,1.8925,3.6773,3.1873,5.7875,6.7867,4.7097,3.2294,5.4545,2.3887,3.9014,1.485,2.5259,4.8508,3.3677,0.2015,0.852,0.9839,1.8082,0.718,2.2171,3.4175,7.6153,0.2509,4.2152,0.031,1.3316,0.001,3.2048,4.0132,4.7103,6.6137,3.3846,0.0299,0.6709]}

{"id":1887,"ended":true,"length":490,"text":"The episode's musical performances were well received by most reviewers. All three were Broadway songs, two from West Side Story and one from Funny Girl \u2014 the concentration on show tunes disappointed me. I don't know if that's an exaggeration of a certain score -- \"The Last Airbender\" has an excellent score while \"The Bluebird\" is quite bad, and \"Beauty and the Beast\" gets a bit of hate.\n\nOne thing I noticed with West Side Story. I didn't pay much attention to the musical, but I don't think I've ever seen a Disney movie on Broadway.\n\nI really wish I could go back and watch all the old one-liners written before the movie even started.\n\nOne thing I noticed with West Side Story. I didn't pay much attention to the musical : I didn't see any of the original cast members, just the characters. I think part of the reason they didn't get cast is because they were all too young and had to go in to the bathroom to get their makeup done.\n\nIn any case I agree with what you've said regarding the Broadway shows. As for the musical performances, well I have to agree and I'd like to see more concerts with the singing!\n\nAnother thing I noticed with West Side Story. I didn't pay much attention to the musical : I didn't see any of the original cast members, just the characters. I think part of the reason they didn't get cast is because they were all too young and had to go in to the bathroom to get their makeup done.\n\nIt was the only one I saw. When I was getting a new one the sound guy from The Office came in to listen to it. He said \"You need to tune your song\", then he sang \"I'll be back soon\". I laughed so hard when he said that. But I have to say I enjoyed listening to him sing. I like the whole 'I'll be back soon' thing.\n\nI agree with it all you have to say. I've seen The First Class and my wife is a fan of West Side Story and said that in the movie. I think as they were playing in a little show where they were trying to catch a plane, she thought that WSA was really bad. And I thought she was very angry with them.

{"id":3681,"ended":true,"length":445,"text":"Union Bank of Switzerland, suffering criticism of its conservative business model, was looking for ways to catch up to its key Swiss rivals and viewed LTCM as the type of client that could attract the investor base.\n\nThe US bank announced in a statement that it would close all the branches of the business, while continuing a two year expansion of the LTCM branch in Canada that it launched in 2010. The bank was founded in Switzerland in 1935.\n\nThe bank's CEO, Hans-Peter K\u00fcckel, said the move was aimed at \"setting a strong example to our international peers and customers.\"\n\nThe bank has been operating for only three years.\n\n\"We had an experience when we started doing the business but had to develop certain qualities and a more diverse team. With all those things combined, LTCM is at the crossroads of a new business era with many questions,\" K\u00fcckel said in a statement provided by bank in Zurich.\n\nThe U.S. bank has also announced a new expansion of the unit in Canada, announcing that it would close branches in that country, with the announcement coming on the eve of the first annual annual dividend, which will consist of a $10 million cut in the bank's share price.\n\nOn Tuesday, LTCM, the biggest Swiss bank in terms of assets, announced it had been closed.\n\nAt the previous dividend of 25 cents per share, LTCM was priced at a price of 1.3 times annualized base annualized value, but for many of its other Swiss customers, that price is closer to 1.6 and therefore the potential profit margin of the deal was not as attractive.\n\n\"Despite the low operating profit of LTCM, our future is bright,\" said K\u00fcckel, who said he had made many steps to strengthen the bank's balance sheet.\n\n\"LTCM has the

He was to enter service as a Captain of the Australian Air Force, but after the outbreak of World War II a request from the United States National Service (USNS) was made for the Australian Air and Navy to enter service as a First Air Force Air and Navy Volunteer (FAN) during the Indian Ocean Campaign.\n\nAfter the war ended Rowell was commissioned as a first Lieutenant of the Australian Air and Navy Expeditionary Force (\"FAN\"), the second Australian Command and Operation Group (\"OCOG\") and the first major Australian naval force. He was subsequently awarded the Air Cross of Merit. In December 1947 Rowell was appointed Chairman of the Reserve Air Wing (R AW ) of the Australian National Command and Operation Group (ANOCOG), succeeding Mark Rowley. Later on he remained Chairman of the Australian Air Force (ANAF) and served until his retirement in 1999. On the day of Rowell's retirement in 1999 the Australian Air Force issued a statement praising his service in the Second Australian Armed Forces (\"SAF\") and said he respected the position \"as it has been developed over the years.\"\n\nRowell had also served aboard the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and the Australian Antarctic Survey.

This is a great source of water for other dolphin species, as well.\nDusky dolphins live a typical lifestyle of drinking water, fruit salad, eating sugar and fruit juice, and eating and drinking fish and invertebrates. In spring they may have food to eat in their home waters but there is no natural feeding spot where they consume these beverages. However, in summer when their body goes hay and beans, they may consume and drink fish, meat, seafood and vegetables.\nDusky dolphins are the only major dolphin species found worldwide in 2020. However, they appear to make their home home as far north as Greenland. Here is the video from their residence in Canada: https:\/\/t.co\/3GVl5N5Y9 pic.twitter.com\/0nXBQ6h2U4 \u2014 Fish and Wildlife (@FWCOfficial) March 7, 2020\nThere are eight species of dolphin found worldwide in the United States and Alaska. These dolphins breed in tropical climates while diving into shallow waters. The dolphins are usually found in the winter time, during breeding season, as well as the spring season, due to the warmer weather, but the dolphins can live in cooler waters through winter for the best opportunities to swim.\nDusky dolphins live in the wild in Canada and Greenland, and their population has increased by almost 30 per cent in the last 20 years.\nDusky dolphin populations are at risk during many years as they are vulnerable to predators.\nThe University of Saskatchewan is in an extremely high risk of extinction due to extinction. If you\u2019re interested in learning more about dolphin conservation at the University, contact a university dolphin conservation officer or an independent advisor.","token_len":508,"entropy":[11.8048,12.9464,4.7753,0.5336,2.6972,6.9537,5.9917,13.8431,8.66,3.7907,12.3411,10.9788,3.5126,4.7725,6.0751,8.945,7.1495,8.0705,3.3253,3.0073,8.9604,0.1411,2.8579,11.6465,2.8223,4.8974,1.6518,6.3052,0.7946,6.9297,3.5038,7.5158,0.9822,4.5448,2.5022,13.9257,6.1981,7.2081,2.6249,4.7913,0.0248,0.96,2.2561,3.3377,2.4094,0.7537,1.2204,1.2132,0.0015,4.1476,2.9673,4.1012,1.6307,5.1489,3.9876,6.0188,2.2526,2.2319,4.6503,0.0935,3.3503,3.1017,3.6503,5.7067,2.118,0.5897,6.053,1.8454,2.2771,0.1334,4.4706,2.253,7.2429,4.2043,4.6737,5.4621,3.8986,4.7526,6.8114,1.1827,3.0039,0.0006,2.9269,0.0009,0.0005,0.0006,4.5874,4.1431,4.0609,4.6119,3.6461,4.5031,7.4647,4.5318,6.0212,6.283,2.5801,0.5458,1.8556,5.2996,6.4639,5.7289,0.0098,0.0878,3.1327,3.2804,0.0002,10.9795,0.2366,15.4233,2.4153,4.6873,13.6202,7.9849,0.8974,4.7047,0.9259,5.4368,3.3959,6.3885,2.7285,6.6107,3.2124,2.9372,3.9838,0.868,2.3678,4.5755,2.2752,3.2788,0.3294,2.5919,0.733,3.1384,4.9591,3.2714,4.3255,3.7542,1.3346,5.8363,1.0218,2.0905,6.6536,3.6523,4.1758,5.3621,2.0729,1.8446,3.2575,4.2521,6.6644,5.1341,4.1632,6.4967,0.177,4.8374,2.1045,2.6085,3.3853,0.0153,1.4898,3.801,0.0986,0.5252,3.5712,1.574,2.3684,2.6157,4.8039,0.1196,2.567,0.6421,4.7286,3.1035,0.3211,1.423,2.471,0.7314,1.0301,1.8618,3.5769,3.7329,0.2453,2.4055,5.1977,6.1227,4.2823,2.733,6.0221,1.4134,1.2654,7.9249,5.9511,0.5746,4.6187,7.3537,1.6249,4.7913,1.9365,0.6104,0.9446,2.6602,4.5776,1.8653,3.9269,1.4529,5.2518,0.0018,0.0533,0.5828,3.478,5.734,2.6458,4.2159,3.4146,4.602,3.7933,0.5655,3.1975,2.2358,4.5328,3.4069,4.1489,4.2686,0.9106,0.9398,5.1549,4.2722,7.1515,3.7112,0.5779,5.7254,2.8916,6.5634,0.2624,4.6847,0.117,2.5337,0.9923,3.2505,3.4323,4.2155,7.8078,5.7915,6.2042,9.0317,1.0179,0.8589,2.0188,3.6326,5.0889,2.0487,3.8381,1.6209,5.4356,0.5762,4.1159,1.0146,2.7794,0.6934,1.2631,1.7774,0.3752,0.1725,1.6251,3.6803,1.5103,5.2666,2.3577,0.2667,4.7967,4.3374,3.1399,11.4985,0.6907,4.1406,0.0872,1.8896,4.7779,0.1612,5.4828,2.9344,1.7495,6.9228,4.3815,3.0587,1.289,0.0419,6.7777,1.3359,3.7319,1.2447,2.845,2.9903,1.6102,4.6114,6.9438,1.3012,6.2299,1.7832,1.2157,0.0003,0.0438,0.0003,0.0018,0.0006,4.3141,8.0567,4.8639,4.0127,4.4114,3.7928,3.9138,4.0877,9.352,0.0004,0.0,0.0005,0.0004,0.0007,4.7077,4.3418,3.7193,4.9948,3.7152,4.1868,4.3989,4.2589,4.3654,3.6237,0.1124,2.4335,0.2635,0.0049,0.0127,0.0007,0.0054,0.0,0.0014,0.0022,0.0569,4.3385,0.0006,0.6135,0.102,4.1675,0.6686,6.3371,1.9328,0.2152,1.6241,3.1601,1.0868,1.7597,0.9524,1.5709,0.0052,2.0573,4.7097,0.6039,2.6286,2.1779,6.3178,1.289,7.0333,3.4661,5.1841,5.7301,4.5241,3.0793,0.8773,1.2678,2.0876,2.439,1.309,4.2104,0.9698,0.897,1.306,4.5087,5.1936,1.7601,3.575,4.363,0.2458,1.229,3.917,1.3747,0.0761,3.6076,2.6715,3.547,1.9788,5.3527,0.0382,1.407,2.9935,2.7987,3.7235,2.2096,2.9994,2.5501,2.2757,2.5591,0.9931,4.1679,1.479,6.7243,3.9495,5.9816,3.9415,3.8562,4.7692,0.6347,4.1173,0.5361,1.1616,1.6689,0.3538,0.1395,2.3865,0.4971,2.0167,2.348,2.3328,4.5441,1.2743,2.9267,1.5475,1.5981,3.2845,3.8628,1.7086,1.2603,2.2036,3.5434,2.8369,4.3495,0.0104,1.4403,0.3297,0.5797,2.3244,0.0137,0.2927,1.984,1.8788,0.1488,3.3695,2.4397,1.4843,4.447,4.0243,5.8005,4.8376,3.403,3.1078,1.4592,1.3719,3.9896,0.0745,2.6813,1.904,2.4568,2.4077,5.8117,0.0222,4.4203,2.9691,4.6746,4.0212,5.1928,3.8884,0.9796,2.3564,0.9488,2.0613,0.009,4.8688,2.5226,5.0085,1.655,14.4805,1.6884,3.3346,2.0157,0.0988,2.3715,0.0736,0.138,3.7754,0.7835,5.4623,1.6871,0.6727,3.92,4.8946,5.0951,5.9794,6.8398,0.617,2.1018,2.3609,4.423,4.2814,7.248,1.0643]}

The game's first play was an incomplete pass that left the running back facing the middle. Once he was able to grab the ball, the ball traveled up the end of the field where it was cut in two by Miami safety Chris Harrison. After the play, there was no replay for those of you who remember the game. The end of the play was a touchdown, and Miami beat Virginia, 21-7.\n\nThis is one of my favorite plays and I truly appreciate that there is one more play that has fans jumping on board with this awesome play. One man needs to stop the spread spread spread spread spread spread because everything else is going as planned. If not, people will be pissed. The other plays were nice but I wouldn\u2019t really call a play nice.\n\nIt was also great that there was no interference on 2nd and 1 with 30 seconds left in both teams\u2019 possessions. The 3rd quarter ended with 0 points on third and 2 with Miami with 12 seconds left. Not bad for a first series of games, don\u2019t you think?\n\n\u201cI'm proud of our football team; I'm proud of them, I'm excited to see where things take them.

If the game is determined on the field late like it is against Clemson, the Miami defense will be on its best behavior.\n\n\u201cWhen I walked out there, I wasn\u2019t thinking about the outcome, just about staying on target. They said the same thing about us as they were playing Clemson, they're going to do everything possible to win the game.\n\n\u201cI was in awe and couldn\u2019t leave the house without cheering for them.

{"id":1180,"ended":true,"length":493,"text":"The first concrete was poured into the dam on June 6, 1933, 18 months ahead of schedule. Since concrete heats and contracts as it cures, the potential for uneven cooling and erosion have not been identified, but the process poses a number of problems including low productivity, high production costs, and the requirement of special handling of the product. It is important to note that the first concrete was poured at a very early stage in 1936.\n\nWith the beginning of concrete's cold summer months, the concrete cold temperatures are increasing and the soil is drying out. It is important to observe this phenomenon because by the time concrete is cooled it is often hard to get any temperature information.\n\nSoil has a special difficulty of treating the concrete by heating it in certain ways. Once the soil is cold to the point that it cannot be heated to room temp without heating it at room scale, the temperature is reduced to the point where the water becomes so cold as to become hard or too soft to the hands that it will fail to melt. In turn, the water is more easily contaminated. The hot water can destroy the soil by freezing or in some cases mixing it with or drinking out of it. Soil and water interactions result in contamination and erosion of the soil, as well as water and waste.\n\nA major problem with the process is that as it cools the soil it becomes less watery and more hot. When the pot is cold there is a limited volume of water being left behind while other parts of the plant are being frozen. All this makes for many of the same problems.\n\nThe process was created at the beginning of the cold season in 1935 and the process was then started in 1933. The process used a mixture of the fresh water and salt, and the salt was poured into the dam first on June 6, 1933.\n\nThe first concrete was poured into the dam on June 6, 1933, 18 months ahead of schedule. Since concrete heats and contracts as it cures, the potential for uneven cooling and erosion have not been identified, but the process poses a number of issues including low productivity, high production costs, and the requirement of special handling of the product. It is important to note that the first concrete was poured at a very early stage in 1936.\n\nWith the beginning of concrete's cold summer months, the concrete cold temperatures are increasing and the soil is drying out.

{"id":1195,"ended":true,"length":467,"text":"Hornung finished his work with the YMCA and returned to England probably in early 1919, according to Rowland. He worked on a new novel but was hampered by poor health. His wife, Sarah, became his wife. The family moved to Yorkshire a year into life and when he was twenty-eight he left the factory. Here he was also taught English by another young engineer, who was \"fancying a new career\"; he did not intend to leave the factory. By the summer 1940, he was retired from the factories and moved to Leeds where he became very involved in the community, where he and Sarah kept up an interest in painting and ceramics. From 1945 to 1955, he had an interest in farming and helped the local farmers improve the water and sewage systems of the country as well as raising crops. He then moved to Wolverhampton where he started a company known as the \"Arkemanian Warke\", in his first time as a farmer in the field. He began working for the YMCA in 1939 where he met and married a young woman known as Emma. He was known to have a strong affinity for pottery and made many pottery and woodcuttery, some of which became well known in the country. His work in the field led to several awards which helped to build a range of pot makers. His work in the fields was always appreciated and he worked on ceramics and pottery, although this was a major business in the years after 1945 when he left the factory and moved into a cottage in West Riding Riding, north of Wolverhampton. His work in England was often referred to as that of the \"Goth\" in the East Riding or \"Gotham\" in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and he was popular in many circles. His friends at the YMCA said he had made many friends with some of his admirers. These included his friends including the daughter of the YMCA founder, Dr. Hughley. Sarah and her husband Paul worked for the YMCA until he joined in 1951 when Emma was employed by the YMCA. Emma married an old farmer in West Riding Riding who in the next few years became her husband.\n\nA little over 50 years ago, Sarah's marriage to Paul ended. However, he still worked in Yorkshire and he and Emma remained close until she died in 1961. She was married to John with whom they were still alive. He passed away aged 85 in a London hospital in 1961.","token_len":509,"entropy":[8.2399,9.9978,11.251,3.0858,5.1306,2.39,2.093,7.7601,4.2283,0.0531,2.8072,5.4329,0.1739,6.5304,10.9377,1.845,3.4511,6.4732,1.8132,5.6589,0.0009,9.6008,1.6792,0.7223,2.1724,3.8021,2.5238,1.9128,3.9614,4.7868,6.3796,2.1311,7.9123,0.1439,4.8895,1.7244,0.9476,3.2651,2.2411,1.3287,4.9377,0.553,4.4501,4.2224,2.5422,2.103,3.3955,3.0645,0.9853,0.2925,5.6772,5.0129,1.4766,5.5291,6.886,2.1241,5.4778,1.3169,1.219,3.9153,0.5215,2.5952,1.0701,3.571,2.2646,6.1937,1.9465,6.8716,0.4058,2.8725,5.9904,6.6469,1.7883,2.2274,5.4625,3.4211,5.482,0.9376,3.3724,2.1135,6.1551,4.9824,5.9538,5.9359,2.7664,3.492,3.4446,5.7384,1.5069,4.2651,0.4827,6.7079,0.1606,2.4686,1.7838,1.0306,1.2657,5.0534,1.2616,4.5643,6.7933,1.7549,1.1366,0.9533,6.1815,1.0313,0.6823,5.7374,1.1409,2.3991,0.4175,4.9364,1.7344,0.1208,3.2661,6.5638,2.5238,0.2194,1.0874,4.1933,2.5947,3.6234,0.1468,5.6744,2.6868,5.538,3.4207,3.1219,3.2184,0.2969,7.3338,1.2022,5.2996,0.0003,0.0001,0.3579,5.3585,4.8814,0.6629,3.4873,1.1692,0.4596,3.6406,3.0784,2.3449,0.0158,6.5419,0.9274,5.7442,3.3004,1.9359,2.9242,4.0452,1.9633,5.9572,3.0672,4.0203,0.8018,1.5132,1.192,5.1053,5.704,0.6341,0.0221,5.5221,3.1314,1.0158,1.1301,4.0799,1.7765,0.2713,6.8055,0.01,0.0,1.2931,0.1251,3.6007,1.758,3.0649,4.7443,0.0394,2.3332,3.7551,6.8462,6.7264,5.9608,5.3497,6.3286,11.0413,2.5778,3.1845,5.9247,3.7456,6.6119,1.8976,0.7216,3.6332,3.5515,1.4234,3.8426,0.2641,1.331,4.1005,2.6787,2.3728,0.8714,4.7767,0.1502,0.0015,0.8183,4.7459,4.6594,0.1484,4.13,3.1772,0.5784,3.3146,1.8617,1.8664,4.7299,0.3347,5.2029,1.5879,2.0859,2.1286,5.9679,1.9692,1.6865,1.9512,3.3974,4.9851,0.2905,7.2156,0.0273,0.7667,4.1408,2.508,2.3603,0.0446,2.8141,4.326,5.0271,5.1495,4.6167,3.7353,0.3224,0.0688,4.2827,5.2359,0.3955,1.3798,0.6029,3.4536,0.3342,3.3389,3.4196,2.0956,1.0031,1.3165,3.6698,0.6985,3.7471,3.2154,4.1052,5.5877,1.4293,3.5105,1.8441,7.1695,0.0154,2.995,10.5287,1.7212,3.0908,3.1265,1.4979,0.476,2.1984,2.2344,5.0629,3.3568,1.1957,1.1413,4.2415,2.4808,5.8099,0.0032,0.0005,1.1775,2.8058,0.055,2.4853,4.2028,4.2907,1.1415,3.423,4.2699,4.9047,1.9335,0.8186,4.8831,2.4582,3.543,2.5451,0.5413,2.5269,0.5854,0.5216,2.224,1.2491,3.3965,1.328,3.4459,1.0681,4.9233,4.9732,10.9278,1.754,4.3976,0.7127,3.0947,0.0003,0.0011,0.276,3.1179,2.7674,1.2463,6.2572,1.621,4.0541,4.1818,0.0105,0.1792,7.644,0.0624,1.3402,0.9524,4.4525,4.1467,3.879,2.405,1.0651,5.9256,1.6326,5.3809,1.3712,2.7476,0.2865,4.7327,1.4968,0.1241,0.1659,0.6652,0.1453,4.7092,0.8621,1.7206,1.8805,1.4231,1.1605,6.4757,2.027,3.5513,3.2952,1.4581,2.6803,6.332,4.388,0.4826,0.7147,0.0154,0.0014,4.0667,1.3067,1.9307,4.4689,2.2456,3.6202,4.1621,4.1036,0.142,1.8951,6.4114,0.0055,1.7231,5.1506,0.3528,3.0834,4.712,5.873,2.4882,7.2303,0.2906,1.9011,4.7393,0.1265,0.0051,3.2218,0.8374,4.1107,1.0453,5.5979,8.1024,3.7479,5.5399,2.8231,3.4235,1.0515,6.3251,4.3308,2.1281,0.8906,0.632,0.0082,0.0013,2.7769,2.8628,4.8235,2.9044,3.3628,3.7648,7.2779,2.4518,5.0189,1.262,0.8366,1.6072,0.0143,0.0023,0.8449,4.224,3.3149,4.4102,2.4056,3.8934,2.8733,3.8199,0.2089,2.2163,1.8064,5.1332,3.2559,4.4507,1.761,0.0564,1.5317,3.7602,1.3321,0.646,3.4302,0.0971,4.1841,4.724,1.0481,4.6194,0.0354,1.211,0.8412,2.8973,3.6625,5.3851,0.2286,1.0782,4.0179,1.5677,4.1493,0.1477,2.6757,3.3228,3.1826,2.2297,4.9885,1.1591,3.238,4.4268,2.2736,2.9866,0.8042,4.1726,3.0527,0.7672,0.5216,4.4077,0.3088,2.7147,0.9077,3.5127,0.5086,3.7868,7.3917,0.8083,2.025,3.8295,3.206,6.4203,0.5735,2.9579,4.5383,0.0514,4.9425,3.528,0.6144,4.3653,4.5596,0.8145,1.4815,3.909,0.3196]}
{"id":4529,"ended":true,"length":467,"text":"In an effort to portray the genius and humanity of the black race, Du Bois published The Souls of Black Folk ( 1903 ), a collection of 14 essays. James Weldon Johnson, one of the founders of the University of Chicago, wrote a much-discussed book, the Souls of black folk, on black artists of the 19th century, including the late artist Charles Woodstock, the father of black art & culture.\n\nIn the book, we find a fascinating historical investigation into the life and times of black artists, from the early 20th century through the 19th Century, to the present day. Du Bois begins by telling us about how black artists were influenced by the work of Frederick Douglass, but the literary influence was not limited to black men.\n\nLater on, as we enter the 18th Century, we move on to examine the origins of black artists of the 19th Century and the period in which we are now living. The Black Artists is a comprehensive and comprehensive study of black artists of both the period 1838 and 1853. Du Bois also shows how the life of black artists of the 19th Century could have been influenced by the works of Black artists and artists of the 20th and 21st centuries, including James Weldon Johnson, the first African American artist.\n\nThis book is a comprehensive and comprehensive study of black Artists of the 19th Century. Du Bois shows how the life of black artists of the 19th Century could have been influenced by the works of Black artists and artists of the 20th and 21st centuries, including James Weldon Johnson, the first African American artist. We explore how artistes in the 19th and 20th century influenced African artists of the 19th century, and the time they made their mark in this area.\n\nIt is easy to find oneself following a historical journey to find the most interesting and influential artists. While there are times where you would have suspected the artist to be an artist, there is actually another time for the artist to be a writer. At this time we are allowed to judge who is truly a scholar and whether he or she is an artist of original intent.\n\nDu Bois highlights the genius and humanity of the black race, and the people and stories behind his or her work in the book. He gives us detailed descriptions of the work of black artists of the 19th century, with stories of inspiration and inspiration from original artists, including Charles Woodstock, the father of black art & culture.","token_len":509,"entropy":[5.2127,2.2328,0.0164,7.3652,1.3734,10.1859,2.8889,5.9753,0.2719,1.521,7.0428,4.5778,0.7126,8.1154,2.5109,0.0026,4.6871,3.7868,9.3766,0.3781,2.9436,2.5404,2.952,12.4443,1.372,0.9205,2.154,0.0407,6.9547,1.9898,3.3118,8.2318,7.7544,1.4847,6.3001,1.003,3.4664,0.0145,0.3386,3.0806,0.0784,0.6268,3.9397,0.138,1.6448,1.1712,2.3154,1.8535,5.5558,1.2567,1.9133,0.0009,2.6209,1.9357,4.3188,5.2644,0.1043,6.2988,0.8551,0.8761,3.8233,3.3369,6.306,2.9855,1.1387,2.5013,0.0102,0.336,1.528,2.8273,2.4116,3.5883,4.6328,3.7804,5.0393,4.2745,1.4467,2.4947,5.4361,0.0545,1.9055,3.0538,8.6852,3.1266,1.1127,2.0689,0.0208,2.2288,1.8819,3.1634,0.4135,2.2606,2.6797,2.5965,5.13,4.5697,5.9506,1.7916,0.6295,2.216,1.0243,2.8649,0.0246,1.5169,0.7811,1.6433,3.4735,1.1729,1.8888,3.5689,0.003,0.0499,1.4202,0.3885,4.0888,0.0122,4.4999,1.1887,3.934,0.5444,1.7698,0.3414,0.2932,3.8757,0.0039,0.0006,5.2093,1.0914,4.8128,0.9557,1.2908,3.1616,2.2817,0.4797,2.2206,3.3185,0.1766,1.5254,4.265,0.0722,5.8643,0.3206,0.0,0.544,4.9024,3.4916,7.1797,3.1225,3.2243,2.1214,2.0015,0.0297,2.0873,4.541,0.6344,2.2083,0.0002,6.192,2.855,0.4737,5.3774,2.1081,4.4915,0.6883,4.3335,0.2759,2.2581,0.1543,1.2176,6.1023,2.4446,0.0861,4.2588,0.711,5.0002,0.3235,1.0377,2.1013,4.0616,0.3125,1.2463,0.0067,1.0066,2.4989,1.4081,6.0657,3.2311,0.1354,3.772,2.328,2.3533,1.3044,0.2041,2.9841,5.8124,4.5217,6.9923,0.931,3.3571,2.7758,2.3696,2.5513,0.2292,1.6407,0.7614,1.3841,5.8148,1.0022,3.8392,4.7552,5.7973,1.3819,1.4787,3.9235,0.7394,3.3844,0.0042,0.0019,2.7637,4.0589,1.6122,1.5619,4.2756,0.9781,1.1992,0.2856,2.0026,0.2395,0.7884,0.0031,0.3808,3.7757,1.0545,0.4624,3.2159,0.1189,0.9897,2.7826,0.0231,5.6437,3.04,4.1718,2.7905,0.4057,0.7763,2.6423,0.0061,3.0713,1.0362,0.0017,0.721,1.8968,2.2189,4.4146,0.617,0.0032,0.0292,0.7172,1.8137,3.5187,2.7737,0.9696,1.2555,2.5142,0.4791,0.0002,3.6981,1.4295,1.0611,1.4134,3.7778,1.4027,0.452,1.3134,0.047,0.8897,9.5557,0.5482,0.1343,0.2779,0.0041,0.0783,1.1514,2.4826,0.0036,0.0025,2.9764,0.6009,0.9214,0.0739,0.0456,0.1585,0.2422,0.3358,0.0226,0.093,0.0048,0.0273,0.0166,0.0115,0.013,0.0098,0.0075,0.2008,0.0342,0.0008,0.7039,0.0236,0.1425,0.0239,0.0019,0.0072,0.052,0.0032,0.3098,0.007,0.0048,0.0596,0.0795,0.013,0.0943,0.0081,0.0002,0.0028,0.0252,0.0086,0.0079,0.0017,0.0079,0.0089,0.0485,3.2059,4.2568,2.5218,6.1786,3.6716,3.3493,0.8708,1.1393,0.003,1.8762,0.7575,0.0056,3.4739,2.4687,3.5765,2.4921,1.0756,0.454,1.0226,0.0254,1.1335,1.1745,2.1435,2.3302,5.4045,2.758,5.3422,0.9341,1.5859,1.5343,4.4722,3.3082,0.2472,1.1072,0.0002,4.6718,0.4806,4.6122,0.0717,3.7084,8.6592,6.5795,2.0008,5.6192,3.6053,3.4807,2.5099,1.8638,4.5756,2.8085,1.6176,2.8991,2.2803,3.0456,4.6603,2.6361,0.4757,6.2966,2.953,2.1614,3.9414,3.1433,7.7256,2.6654,4.92,2.9611,0.5396,2.8371,2.8063,1.7301,2.0807,1.4482,5.6605,5.728,1.5367,6.144,2.5333,1.33,0.3669,1.5018,1.5579,3.3745,1.036,5.5435,2.4009,1.1109,4.2083,1.4893,6.3614,0.2344,6.1199,4.1579,1.1001,3.0756,1.9652,5.5432,1.5006,4.7577,2.1215,0.9991,0.015,0.7379,2.4435,0.3349,1.9718,6.7756,4.7923,0.4134,1.1642,0.0002,2.8396,0.0061,0.0019,6.0704,1.0705,6.2784,0.8164,0.4746,0.0442,0.6282,0.1723,0.3272,0.749,1.5002,1.8001,5.2363,2.685,4.5263,2.1268,3.8571,4.0674,0.0025,1.0708,4.4211,1.6663,2.8879,0.2715,2.1013,3.7021,0.4927,5.3693,1.6491,0.1077,0.9787,4.0187,0.4111,1.5331,0.212,1.0472,0.1151,0.366,0.0022,1.4528,0.572,4.5316,5.8696,1.0507,5.2159,1.1507,2.2564,1.7627,7.2167,1.7931,2.0431,3.1494,2.3313,0.055,0.0169,0.4513,1.0426,0.8664,0.0023,0.0834,0.0447,0.3781,0.0045,0.3041]}

The proportion of home dads aged over 25 has risen only 7.2 per cent to 12.7 million.\n\nThe figure has been driven by a shift in attitudes towards home parental involvement. \u201cWhile the proportion of UK dads aged 25 to 34 has rose from 2.2 per cent in 1994 to 15.9 per cent in 2007, more than half of all UK parents are now aged 25 or older,\u201d according to the British Society for Family Education\u2019s annual report.\n\nFor example, in 1997, there were 29,690 home dads in the UK, the lowest figure since 1989.\n\n\u2018Home\u2019 fathers have been less likely to have left home for at least 25 years. In fact, parents leave more time than previously thought, according to the study \u2018Home\u2019 father involvement in the UK: the study found that more than six out of every ten home fathers leave for the first time between 1999 and 2005.\n\nThe authors argue that in order to measure the impact of home paternity on the birthrate, the data needs to reflect \u201ca complete and accurate picture of the impact of the birthrate on the future birth rate.\u201d Indeed, the study reveals that the UK birth rate is expected to rise by 5.6 per cent for the next 10 years.\n\n\u201cWhile we are very happy with progress in parental involvement among families, we still need to study more carefully in the next generation which may be more vulnerable to such a shift,\u201d said Michael Pardee, the researcher from the University of Leeds.\n\n\u201cIf we are to find out just how important home dad involvement is for the birth rate, we must first understand why home dads are not going to leave the home for a long time.\u201d","token_len":509,"entropy":[1.9909,3.9137,3.0533,1.9188,1.8176,3.1333,1.2419,0.3905,1.8348,6.1171,0.0803,10.3319,12.6182,7.8533,4.6002,6.7341,4.4326,3.4945,1.2522,5.9067,10.481,2.6929,9.8417,3.8288,2.4997,0.8012,5.9017,2.3707,4.0082,4.5447,0.7164,5.2037,0.002,1.1368,4.6726,1.7721,5.7702,3.9511,0.016,0.6231,5.7363,3.592,0.2321,1.6815,0.8372,1.5746,0.6801,0.0475,4.3569,4.5114,6.5245,4.1,5.1482,3.3415,6.6183,2.0437,4.5191,3.2763,2.4024,3.1003,7.536,0.3526,0.1853,0.053,3.3076,2.0078,5.4202,2.7737,8.6552,0.1242,0.7507,1.4413,2.9154,7.3727,5.2551,1.1784,2.5611,1.4158,0.1359,6.8788,4.5897,1.8868,3.5696,6.9031,0.1917,5.962,3.671,3.2527,3.6008,4.0318,1.0629,5.3702,3.7705,3.0924,1.0602,3.1039,0.5156,0.904,0.0013,5.0455,0.4868,0.0015,3.6612,1.4899,4.3037,1.4402,5.2817,14.2133,8.5278,2.7862,4.2271,5.9395,4.4209,3.1946,0.7487,3.5963,0.2212,3.7184,2.7229,0.2555,1.915,0.6775,0.0204,4.1597,4.3998,2.481,4.8988,13.379,5.5356,7.7228,4.8554,1.3735,3.3341,1.0354,5.5291,4.0428,0.0032,2.1133,0.3185,3.2414,2.853,0.7576,2.2432,3.9642,0.2116,2.3983,0.3786,4.1566,3.277,2.3935,1.7369,2.6103,3.5274,5.1951,0.4642,2.0196,7.4224,0.0057,4.3921,4.7803,0.1573,2.1558,2.5147,0.9928,0.8093,0.0002,1.967,3.9176,4.6402,1.1635,3.7164,0.671,1.3967,3.7642,0.636,3.1549,1.2058,1.9181,6.4428,2.6475,1.2028,7.6128,5.1048,5.7997,1.9171,2.2909,0.0384,5.7999,1.0301,2.2314,2.3689,1.4711,1.0771,1.0755,7.3062,1.7142,3.7864,0.1719,2.3261,0.9731,0.002,0.5611,3.8318,0.2377,4.8186,0.1009,2.402,0.254,0.0013,0.199,0.9049,0.239,5.3069,0.8088,0.8521,0.5976,3.448,1.9415,4.1873,1.8636,0.6776,4.5313,1.5991,2.186,0.5741,1.592,6.1233,6.4188,3.8181,0.004,1.1307,5.7313,4.0285,0.6372,2.5843,5.9074,2.5141,1.1343,1.7618,3.8478,1.0215,0.8199,0.5229,0.0002,4.9171,2.3785,0.0453,1.7449,3.7815,0.5923,4.2597,0.241,5.217,0.915,7.0745,1.5894,0.4059,1.0438,0.6951,0.0947,0.9197,4.1193,3.074,1.4339,0.6346,3.9877,0.3866,2.1538,0.0002,3.1149,1.3295,3.6845,6.3313,0.3402,2.1198,2.3065,2.1724,4.0884,1.2684,0.2801,3.2629,6.1942,2.3891,1.9324,4.0852,0.0112,5.6563,0.1441,2.0479,2.6877,1.8218,0.043,6.2167,5.0418,3.0812,4.1189,2.7725,6.1207,0.3967,1.5168,3.4093,0.0023,0.9462,2.8696,3.624,1.1984,4.3767,1.2718,0.0294,4.2083,4.7551,1.4313,1.208,0.8096,3.4467,3.1057,5.4136,1.4397,0.2375,4.2845,0.5846,4.5941,2.138,0.0034,1.897,0.6885,2.7327,1.333,2.4072,2.0641,3.4335,0.8829,0.0246,4.0388,3.7868,0.0469,2.6913,0.5472,0.5522,0.0002,2.1002,4.6849,3.647,0.1119,4.3835,2.5676,0.2304,6.5374,1.5431,2.2364,0.2046,0.6749,5.4681,0.6349,1.7036,5.8615,3.18,0.3674,2.0243,3.4386,2.8711,0.0287,4.0948,7.3632,3.9648,2.7538,6.5031,3.2487,1.2173,1.2421,0.2656,1.0989,4.9326,0.3954,3.7632,4.327,0.5227,0.2251,0.6875,4.8986,2.9329,2.5806,0.7095,4.3873,4.1208,6.7493,0.0401,1.418,2.2148,6.0586,0.2646,1.7403,3.4743,3.5789,1.5331,1.4964,3.5236,0.018,1.5489,1.0416,3.7258,0.3516,2.2421,0.4866,0.0058,3.612,1.1723,0.5586,2.914,0.0648,1.277,0.4399,0.0002,2.326,3.0725,4.1368,4.6825,2.1303,5.2208,1.9365,1.6611,7.8788,0.8629,5.8765,1.3944,5.1266,5.3279,0.8679,1.3636,3.3607,1.1076,0.2915,5.4349,2.2224,4.0852,4.8658,1.8618,3.134,3.0441,5.7944,2.6513,2.2971,2.1755,4.2889,0.2908,5.6985,1.8693,1.9048,3.0287,1.7283,1.8841,3.4432,5.4235,4.9127,5.1806,1.9059,0.239,2.9471,5.4863,2.5882,1.0049,2.2905,0.0331,3.9098,0.9692,0.4653,0.0002,1.5961,1.5818,3.772,0.97,1.5931,0.8603,4.5614,1.9724,4.438,0.1954,3.2377,1.1336,3.7373,0.7825,0.4421,1.8575,1.2958,3.0338,3.0258,0.4651,1.2434,2.0885,3.5456,1.384,2.3217,3.1367,0.9576,0.9871,3.1302,5.4524,0.7791,2.2089,2.3931,1.0911,1.5844,2.3221,2.3036,0.175,0.5534,1.3563,1.5451]}

McCarey was recalled by Wolverhampton Wanderers due to the absence of the injured Kevin Long.\nInjury has been a concern for the Championship strugglers, but it will take plenty of determination from manager Jamie Carragher to turn the tables on their hosts.\nWolverhampton Wanderers' Jake Jarvis, left, celebrates with his team-mates during the Championship Trophy match against Morecambe at the Stade de France in Lyon, France, January 27, 2015.\nAnd, while it is not expected that he will be back from injury for the remainder of the season, it is the manager who had the most serious and significant injury in his team.\nHe was forced off after making some serious offsides and, after a clash with Stoke-on-Trent's Jack Clarke in the final third, admitted that it was an unfortunate setback.\nWolves will now have to do a review of the game in relation to the injury, which Carragher described as \"disastrous\".\nHe said: \"I know that for us it was an unfortunate injury. It was a difficult and long day, but unfortunately it was a bad injury that we got to the point where, obviously, we couldn't really take more than a point from their day.\n\"Our first game back, although at Old Trafford, we were very lucky that we missed one of our best players. And it was unfortunate because we played really well.\n\"It would have been far better for us to have taken that one-goal advantage into a game against the next team. We looked really good from the start and were actually trying to play the game in a way that was a little bit uncomfortable for us.\n\"But it doesn't matter to us because we played a lot better. I think we are getting better than expected and it is nice that we can go and focus on what we can do.\"\nThis season, Wolverhampton Wanderers have lost five matches in a row, going 9th in the table.\nLast weekend in the English Premier League, Wolverhampton Wanderers beat Leeds 1-0 in the first leg through injury.\nSpeaking about the injuries in the team, Carragher added: \"For us, it was really unfortunate.

{"id":1071,"ended":true,"length":415,"text":"In Oahu, areas on the windward side of the island received more than 1 in ( 25 mm ) of rain on August 12 from the remnants of Felicia, causing many roads to remain closed, according to the Office of the Director of Public Works (OPW).\n\nIn Hawai\u2018i, the Windward Islands have received more than 100 mm ( 20 mm ) of rain between Friday and Sunday, according to the official data. These areas included the islands of Kaukauna, Kiawahua, Kapua, Oahu and Kauai. On the island of Oahu, the rain started on Friday morning and ended by Sunday afternoon, according to the NOAA.\n\n\u201cRain had long held off the eastern half of the islands on Wednesday and Friday but stopped as early as Sunday afternoon as it continued its progress to the west on Saturday,\u201d said OWR Spokeswoman Michelle Nappas.\n\nAccording to the OWR, there were no major hurricanes and that Hawaii will continue to receive rainfall for the next five days due to increased pressure. The storm surge on the windswept islands of Kauai is believed to have pushed 8-10 feet of precipitation down and to Oahu, where it was forecast to grow larger as it progressed.\n\nThe Windward Islands received the heaviest rainfall in recent history as well, with the total precipitation seen falling to 5-7 millimeters at Oahu on August 13, with Kauai receiving as much as 11 cm of rain after midnight. The windshow storm surge, estimated for 15 km\/h, would likely bring 5 to 8 km\/h rain at Hawaiian-style beaches between Kauai and the island of Kiawahua.\n\nThe Windward Islands National Park received 24 rain showers on Monday, according to the Hawaii Department of Environmental Protection.\n\nKaiwahua, the main beach on Kiawahua, received about 20.6 cm ( 9.3 inches ) of rain between Friday and Sunday morning, according to the U.S. State Dept.\n\nThe windward islands suffered the heaviest rain falling as far east as Kiawahua. In Kauai on Friday afternoon, 7 cm ( 19.6 inches ) of rain fell, according to the WISN.\n\n\u201cThe windward islands received rain showers over the weekend on both ends of the island, but were at their heaviest in three days, according to OWR Spokeswoman Michelle Nappas.","token_len":511,"entropy":[7.7588,4.0135,0.719,9.9934,5.1341,0.5859,10.3861,1.6694,1.1147,0.254,0.4943,2.2619,7.2216,3.0446,0.6119,2.5114,7.1628,8.5217,12.5796,9.0536,0.7656,0.1384,1.1917,3.1186,4.3217,3.6526,4.4015,1.5391,6.5287,0.0171,13.3174,5.3775,2.6253,5.9103,5.3559,5.579,0.3438,5.5399,0.2973,2.7475,2.0323,0.0011,1.1667,5.8816,0.0402,0.9681,3.6094,0.159,2.1543,1.053,2.1995,2.0685,0.1394,0.2814,0.7333,0.0012,2.8301,4.8007,17.1777,6.2479,5.9946,0.214,1.7162,5.813,0.4641,3.2653,3.2952,2.2662,1.4906,0.0322,3.5726,0.3284,1.8257,7.278,1.9762,0.016,0.0451,0.1694,5.0812,6.5151,0.6172,1.0238,1.0587,1.0906,0.0018,0.729,6.7807,3.8121,0.7076,5.4008,3.4351,3.837,1.5222,3.8388,0.3045,2.624,5.2201,0.6608,0.866,2.4841,4.771,3.3545,0.2714,1.8677,0.2736,4.8171,3.2921,0.3629,3.6585,0.0933,1.6422,2.8722,0.7691,0.5065,4.527,1.8851,4.5027,0.0358,0.9523,0.0188,0.1026,1.3282,2.9413,5.2607,1.3811,2.1826,2.6235,1.3031,3.0258,4.3522,1.1654,1.0473,1.2869,1.2276,0.0019,0.5041,4.7929,0.8172,0.3914,0.0002,5.6088,6.1378,6.7216,7.4275,7.2576,6.9381,5.1794,1.8385,5.3067,2.1046,0.0107,0.5165,4.2939,4.1701,3.4653,2.1081,2.3837,4.4121,5.0739,3.9361,3.5429,0.1121,2.61,1.7386,3.608,3.4891,3.2831,3.6265,4.3845,3.3032,0.4786,1.5187,4.0383,1.5726,1.3645,11.7462,6.3807,2.8448,2.8535,6.9644,5.6288,0.0079,1.4951,5.506,4.7071,6.0531,5.0695,0.3453,0.5213,0.0002,4.862,0.0025,0.8431,1.4863,0.3068,0.4113,3.2148,0.8391,2.1524,2.1705,4.9278,3.9624,4.2016,6.8101,3.7742,2.1804,0.341,1.5272,3.1502,2.9481,0.9928,1.0462,3.4852,0.1905,4.5145,0.0323,5.0598,4.5544,2.2373,2.3664,2.7139,2.7311,3.868,1.9528,6.643,3.5145,0.0032,2.3675,3.1347,1.5442,0.9907,3.961,4.5016,0.0086,0.8869,4.6522,7.3273,3.6821,0.7192,2.6304,2.4868,5.2168,2.7625,4.7385,4.7474,8.4036,0.0182,1.1709,2.5179,1.2528,2.2346,2.9682,0.1507,4.7346,8.3807,2.3644,0.8757,4.0515,1.0842,0.3731,0.0003,1.8031,5.0218,0.01,0.238,3.0715,3.4493,1.8481,0.7209,1.5419,5.1695,2.7769,3.5372,3.1936,1.5436,1.4384,2.597,4.163,4.6442,6.2985,4.6581,1.0848,3.3471,2.306,1.8552,5.0151,0.1524,4.7724,3.834,0.0061,2.2189,1.8569,2.6134,1.3409,3.6325,6.8498,0.6628,2.581,6.057,0.2958,0.0751,3.9992,5.4248,1.3579,0.345,6.2647,5.7326,0.7691,1.9541,3.6114,10.9972,8.1129,1.378,3.8233,4.3637,6.473,7.0224,3.9432,3.864,0.0867,0.6522,4.9377,3.3293,4.1859,4.7569,2.4749,2.2096,3.8016,0.821,0.0034,5.1666,3.7565,7.1773,4.7038,4.5929,4.5768,5.115,3.9172,0.1427,0.1241,2.6976,3.2059,0.7261,3.6828,1.9559,0.0533,0.0228,0.0384,0.9627,0.3599,0.0003,1.661,3.2747,0.0041,0.1612,5.2445,0.8147,4.2862,5.7702,8.7558,3.3792,2.0721,4.2826,0.9386,3.0637,0.0025,0.6279,5.2754,1.0358,0.0014,3.0614,1.2768,0.7286,1.1711,0.0002,4.9752,3.4449,3.726,0.2494,0.0182,2.2613,1.9202,3.7929,4.1148,1.8426,4.8946,0.4181,0.0117,0.0115,0.036,0.7928,0.9907,3.8462,3.1455,4.4471,2.3174,1.2603,2.734,4.5219,0.6048,2.4209,1.2093,0.7333,0.0804,0.0877,3.1282,2.3,0.0893,0.3658,3.832,0.8485,0.6917,0.0028,0.3082,4.9451,0.0766,0.0144,0.0082,4.9822,6.7156,0.1131,1.6743,0.0002,1.6687,3.0598,1.8747,1.118,5.3831,2.1965,1.5798,1.5367,6.7543,5.1159,3.3708,2.6489,0.0349,2.8369,1.2333,0.0201,0.0042,0.0163,2.8044,3.1592,4.103,0.0762,4.4591,2.086,2.3041,0.123,5.5828,1.8116,0.1872,6.2656,0.4998,2.1706,0.0812,0.0791,0.0693,0.0631,0.3603,1.9108,2.0271,0.0038,0.311,5.875,5.6357,2.983,0.8267,0.4865,0.0003,3.8935,0.8498,1.5732,2.1198,0.3694,0.4555,2.2661,5.291,3.7819,4.2769,0.9005,1.1717,3.8494,3.1256,4.5168,0.0684,0.3587,1.0169,1.1905,2.9643,3.1283,4.947,1.9736,3.4402,2.0919,5.732,0.3057,1.4753,0.8187,0.0035,3.3333,0.4329,0.3709,0.0014,0.1113,0.6878,0.0231,0.0027,0.0014,0.0761]}
{"id":1097,"ended":true,"length":456,"text":"The role of the stay @ - @ at @ - @ home dad is not traditional in India, but it is socially accepted in urban areas. According to one sociologist's study, the average family size is between 2.6 and 3.3 people who are able to leave home at the usual 4:30 a.m., 7 hours time frame, with their children only 6 minutes. But now people are taking more time to spend at home with their children. So the government has given a significant amount of permission for kids to stay at home with their grandparents. The parents also have to find and use the space. And it is not enough for them to cook. Children also have to keep up with the needs of their grandparents. This is where India has begun thinking of more social isolation. With all those social isolation measures, the youngsters in urban areas are actually at home at 3.3 to 3.6 people. Children in rural areas also tend to live in separate bedrooms with their grandparents and parents. This is where our children get stuck. The reason is because their grandchildren need extra physical space and we do not have the space to give them that, or at least that time for that. We also have to be responsible and be able to work from home without the support and support of our children. And the government is doing a fantastic job in this area. The government is creating an appropriate atmosphere. If it is safe, then this can be a good environment for kids to stay at home with their grandparents and parents who are able to use the space for social distancing. But when families are working from home, at home, that kind of scenario breaks down a bit. There is no need to be worried. If the kids come together, they will be able to continue. And that situation can go on forever, but it can also be overcome if the parents are able to do what they want. If they choose to work, children will learn and live, but there is no shortage of free childcare. And for the parents too it can be a chance to be present.\nFor more information visit: https:\/\/www.kadambulapadamud.com.in\/.\nAbout Kadambulapadamud\nKadambulapadamud is a joint venture company in which two companies are working as a team for an open-air gymnasium.

In 1929 a bond was passed that would construct the Omaha Municipal Airport in the city center, the new city itself. Although the bonds were intended to be repaid, the bonds were eventually disordered, and while a bond is an important first-time debt, it is an extremely large interest. A bond being repaid for an entire period can take several years to pay off. If repayment is necessary for maintaining public safety, there are several ways this problem can be approached.\n1. If bonds and funds are provided, there is one simple alternative mechanism in place. This alternative is to grant the bonds permission to fly. If the bonds are issued, they are not issued to the private companies. Instead, they are issued to those companies that own the bonds and are paying a royalty fee. Most bondholders are likely to make the loans available to them, but there are many companies that are not and that would like to have the bonds issued to them.\n2. Most bondholders need to agree on an acceptable fee. They can go to a bondholder, or they can only take loans, bonds and funds that are available. Both options involve the issuance of bonds without bond support.\n3. It is estimated that, by the current economic environment in which the bond issue has been completed, bonds will be issued to at least 25% of all bonds issued. This is not the case when one is paying for a bond rather than a loan. If interest rates are lowered to allow for lower interest rates, bonds will become less expensive to borrow. When interest rates are raised, bonds can become less expensive to borrow and in turn earn higher interest rates. It is estimated that by the current market climate this will reduce the demand for bonds.\n4. As a first-time debt, bond issuance often is not cost effective. Bond issuance can be costly. When the current financial conditions are particularly challenging, interest rates on bonds increase and bond issuance is often slow. It is noted that bond issuance is likely to increase to about 95%, even 100%.\n5. Bond issuance in the short term is highly expensive. The interest rates are at nearly 50%. A bond issuance of a nominal amount could be issued at a discount, meaning that it would be relatively easy for the companies that finance the bonds to raise their interest rates with lower interest rates at lower rates.\nThus, there is a need for an alternative to an ongoing debt issuance process.","token_len":512,"entropy":[10.3629,10.2778,11.5528,6.2547,5.2176,7.714,17.0628,2.9492,6.0181,10.7483,4.0139,9.232,7.3107,2.9713,4.3978,1.2524,2.829,1.5949,6.862,3.9479,6.8143,0.7185,2.9688,7.0736,3.7778,9.9085,1.615,4.8332,2.9334,3.1721,10.199,1.7964,5.3336,3.9273,0.3697,3.8787,1.7632,1.2583,4.8363,2.0301,4.0612,5.0512,3.232,6.823,2.1578,4.8475,0.9916,4.7783,0.5941,4.8322,0.2272,1.689,3.9608,2.1863,1.2481,3.2863,0.7039,3.2959,5.559,9.0553,2.1289,1.1912,6.1349,3.5878,5.004,3.8602,4.0133,3.0847,5.2203,6.2289,2.3908,6.9349,0.8565,0.7346,1.0048,4.0448,2.6814,5.1405,5.4836,2.0954,3.905,2.5698,6.3917,3.495,4.037,3.0732,3.4376,4.8944,3.8804,3.906,3.2088,0.286,0.6754,1.9613,0.4454,0.6956,4.0326,7.7308,0.8031,5.4388,3.3624,8.4125,3.7199,1.3036,0.5133,3.4996,0.9887,1.9896,1.79,5.1518,6.3895,0.36,0.1916,8.0489,0.2767,1.5385,7.794,0.2727,4.4311,5.8781,5.6043,4.3666,0.4737,4.6555,1.3781,3.108,0.6703,5.0657,3.3396,4.7848,9.0439,4.1554,1.8789,1.3015,3.9302,3.1689,1.6352,0.9854,5.4282,1.7601,1.5758,8.2577,0.0893,2.3008,2.4941,2.7303,1.082,2.5277,0.6673,2.8487,1.3394,2.2821,1.1084,3.5022,1.7807,2.4273,1.9646,4.593,5.335,2.3638,2.0283,0.2736,1.012,0.1206,0.6802,0.2916,5.0563,3.0796,1.4181,3.3754,0.8676,2.2667,1.671,2.2553,4.6957,3.4268,3.4749,3.6453,1.1743,6.275,6.4345,1.0401,2.0781,5.6254,0.6738,5.2184,2.0862,5.6949,5.7207,0.5417,2.1983,1.5913,1.5111,2.645,0.5997,1.8682,2.7137,0.4816,1.8181,1.5718,5.2232,2.6438,3.2068,2.3896,0.1568,3.4504,1.1717,2.6093,1.7373,1.4076,0.2984,0.4707,2.2044,0.2397,0.0007,5.5847,3.0695,0.1428,5.7591,0.5401,4.5502,2.0604,3.1951,2.7132,2.4634,1.8234,4.1547,2.1196,4.7741,0.3895,1.7064,4.1915,2.7151,3.2529,2.6226,1.1366,0.0421,6.4994,4.4485,4.5851,3.5948,8.0729,2.289,3.1196,2.8905,0.8558,3.2457,1.7642,6.0022,1.8454,4.6567,2.646,2.9946,0.0883,2.6048,5.7279,7.8255,6.4036,0.7122,1.5724,0.2609,0.001,4.1044,0.3709,5.0318,0.0611,4.4196,3.0986,1.183,6.0154,4.177,4.3694,3.7758,2.2227,0.8687,4.1082,2.8775,2.8803,1.4347,3.5466,0.1832,4.6271,1.7146,1.2318,0.4497,1.6513,4.3303,0.0129,3.6027,1.6756,0.0709,1.7662,5.3289,0.5079,2.5398,1.7749,1.4904,3.1859,2.8477,1.4905,4.2283,4.4694,2.1239,3.909,2.7499,1.5744,3.2598,5.5874,0.0174,2.1033,1.2746,0.4671,3.2059,5.5978,0.5453,0.6682,4.0536,2.1358,3.9949,1.048,4.1966,1.347,0.1346,0.5423,2.8865,0.6872,2.8385,2.3535,1.7034,1.8105,3.9286,0.7303,4.6607,0.9933,0.0428,0.3387,1.6774,1.0483,1.9617,3.1966,1.3387,1.7649,0.2449,0.3677,0.4349,2.5464,4.9756,0.6293,5.7421,1.3607,0.789,0.1594,0.1935,4.1246,0.3262,2.1148,0.0636,2.9321,0.5112,0.8083,6.3588,6.5786,4.4234,1.7113,3.1405,0.4577,3.4771,0.0633,0.8984,1.3431,0.7615,0.4452,0.0012,3.5627,2.3003,3.8701,3.6482,0.1277,1.8013,0.8789,3.8336,1.6152,4.9135,2.7165,1.9126,5.3659,0.5841,0.6369,5.8499,0.8326,2.0892,0.6488,2.7321,3.2533,3.9288,1.884,4.0124,2.9753,2.5534,0.8975,7.0739,3.544,0.3242,4.8026,0.1215,3.9422,1.3503,4.8082,2.2244,2.7263,0.8049,1.7995,2.1402,6.2307,0.7514,3.3094,0.3257,7.0224,0.2229,3.7055,0.5816,1.3139,5.3699,0.0512,2.5042,4.076,3.1968,6.4845,3.621,3.484,7.389,2.1762,1.6547,0.529,0.0011,4.8239,0.6232,4.4167,1.0818,4.0986,0.3997,1.3488,4.0384,3.5128,0.6024,2.1795,3.2825,1.2757,2.4017,5.3363,6.6241,3.3617,1.7679,3.5893,2.0075,2.0462,2.4881,3.7978,5.8127,2.344,4.0086,1.1199,4.7091,2.2665,1.3335,3.2949,3.3352,5.3067,0.6581,2.6701,1.7391,1.0563,5.5173,2.5151,1.1958,0.8961,5.1895,1.8797,5.5805,0.5398,0.597,0.0671,3.4967,2.1644,1.9293,0.1553,5.5476,3.7812,0.8318,0.0192,4.9884,4.7729,1.1134,0.2712,1.8992,7.0769,0.2742,2.9324,0.7406,1.0401,3.2073,0.486,2.6622,0.6449,2.3317,4.4356,5.3812,2.5679,1.7698,2.492,0.6834]}

At night, an area containing the areas was recorded as being a target for terrorist fire.\n\nOn Saturday, April, the Navy and the US Navy announced the formation of a National Guard and called for active coordination between security forces and military units in order to combat terrorism.\n\n\u201cIn the light of recent terrorist attacks, there will be a heightened awareness of the need for immediate military action to prevent terrorist attacks,\u201d said Rear Adm. (retd) Scott Burt, a Naval War College spokesperson.\n\nHe said that the Naval Strategic Command is currently assisting with the operations in the areas affected by terrorist attacks.\n\nNuclear attacks in the Middle East include the Sept 11, 2001, attacks in New York and Saudi Arabia, and other attacks on civilian populations.\n\nIn the past, attacks on military bases have led to civilian deaths.\n\nTensions between the US, allies\n\nNavy personnel in the Middle East were also seen with an unusual pattern.\n\nIn January, the US Navy dispatched a fleet of fighter aircraft on a reconnaissance mission to monitor the location of targets in Syria. The deployment was also designed to reduce tensions in the region.\n\nOn April 29, the US Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) was hit by a blast from a rocket from the Lebanon. In the same week, the US Navy conducted raids in Iraq on suspected terrorists who allegedly targeted oil stations.\n\nAlso on April 28, the US Navy carried out a coordinated bombing campaign on Iraqi military bases.\n\nThe US Navy said that the area around the bases was monitored for the purpose of stopping the proliferation of radical Islamists in Iraq.\n\nThe use of drones in the region is especially important in the Middle East, in the wake of the 9\/11 attacks.

Later in the second quarter, the Tide had 3 second possessions on the field, but they only got to 3 points. After Alabama\u2019s third quarter, Florida started to come off the screen with their second field goal of the game. Florida started to get back into it, but the Alabama offense and defense went in against them, both times making it a close game.\nIn the fourth quarter, Alabama scored 2 penalties on Florida with a penalty flag on the ground, and then 3 points for Florida. Then, they got to 3 and Florida\u2019s second field goal of the game; making it a 7-point game\nAlabama scored in as many seconds of action. Then 2 penalties went into extra time before the Tide missed a field goal. With 7 third down plays out of a possible 23 points, they were still up 17-5 at the end of the first half. But Florida never looked back, scoring 3 on the second and third-quarter possessions.\nFlorida finally took its first lead of the game in the third quarter when the Tide found themselves right back in the game with their fifth touchdown pass of the day. It was this point of the game when the Tide left the field early to take a field goal on the play. This was the second straight game that Alabama had scored in the quarter.\nAlabama is 0-2 now, and is tied with Florida for the worst record in the SEC. This is an especially bad start for the Gators after their wins against Clemson and South Dakota State.\nKey to Alabama\u2019s offense: All of Alabama\u2019s receivers have looked great so far in 2019 and would be great as a starting quarterback. If Alabama\u2019s defense picks up with each passing game at their level, they will look to keep a record high, which they have done throughout their 2018 NCAA Tournament run.","token_len":513,"entropy":[3.4603,10.0963,2.0999,1.2677,4.3511,3.4264,8.0988,2.8485,1.9233,0.2553,3.1236,2.9071,2.4728,3.7589,0.1135,3.7678,8.9561,4.2999,1.6419,3.8444,6.2398,0.5154,2.0652,1.1891,0.3376,5.8602,15.2859,7.3967,8.5601,9.1922,13.2693,7.4519,3.8063,0.0599,2.9452,5.5863,2.0216,2.2949,0.7796,3.4632,1.5205,4.0596,4.7633,3.4219,1.6268,0.0039,6.6156,2.1378,4.3144,0.0372,3.2365,1.1998,4.9243,1.8033,2.8593,5.4699,2.2306,3.5735,3.7737,3.4574,3.8274,1.7381,6.7972,4.2981,1.6099,6.9517,1.8321,0.3381,4.1568,2.6479,0.5641,1.0417,2.8186,1.8878,0.0027,2.7366,1.2186,0.1715,2.8507,0.0265,2.6733,1.1755,4.4488,1.1427,2.1586,1.0754,0.0034,1.3669,2.1744,4.766,4.3195,2.9491,1.8592,4.2334,3.6136,3.2989,4.9993,0.1881,0.1817,2.5609,1.6885,3.6911,3.431,7.2527,1.188,0.4991,0.9608,4.6283,15.7717,6.9384,4.4202,2.6296,6.8389,0.4633,6.8235,0.0253,0.6635,2.3508,5.5676,0.3354,2.2303,1.8,1.1626,3.5009,5.9592,4.4137,10.9021,7.3855,1.906,1.31,3.398,4.8275,2.8783,2.7678,1.281,3.0523,1.5882,0.7721,7.7366,0.8724,0.0167,3.1435,0.8206,0.2128,1.8332,1.054,3.0952,4.3242,4.8511,6.4051,3.4865,1.4296,3.9394,0.9921,2.1182,2.3083,3.7713,2.3837,3.6461,3.6792,3.1299,1.732,3.4043,2.9538,15.3609,0.25,0.1439,2.0065,2.6524,1.1011,2.7167,2.65,1.7714,4.0621,2.9024,0.4453,8.8812,2.8387,3.1908,2.9768,1.5932,0.0131,1.1016,0.0088,0.3422,0.7272,2.6004,2.7281,1.1072,2.1525,3.773,1.3854,2.7717,1.066,1.793,1.991,3.8994,2.2088,5.5811,1.2536,4.3096,3.8798,6.7256,3.0689,1.6542,5.9536,3.7965,4.5472,2.3789,2.1071,3.5828,0.1434,0.1888,3.3502,6.8262,0.4036,1.6943,0.0351,0.2164,0.8828,3.8709,4.6866,7.7994,2.3545,3.5495,4.195,2.3877,5.6524,7.593,3.008,0.8867,5.0858,1.713,1.2505,2.3957,4.2359,4.074,3.6998,2.2811,0.8299,4.0347,1.3164,3.2182,2.2731,3.2136,1.6474,4.1305,3.8505,8.9528,0.0189,0.1286,2.5971,1.9252,0.0102,1.3174,0.0034,0.1197,7.6883,6.8667,0.2866,0.5309,3.8568,0.7596,1.8086,0.3377,6.252,1.5973,4.1678,4.0297,6.779,0.1691,3.5247,2.2818,4.2575,3.0145,3.9436,6.6502,3.3115,3.9476,3.4512,5.6201,0.3196,5.5908,0.9913,2.9128,7.2513,1.9777,1.8273,0.0046,1.334,4.9203,5.091,8.9361,3.7721,3.3017,6.0675,0.6941,4.152,0.2243,4.7544,4.1095,0.2978,3.4071,2.2587,4.7212,4.3464,3.8572,0.6448,3.8912,3.1261,0.352,1.7298,0.236,0.1804,2.0205,0.8729,0.3948,4.3896,3.4342,5.4574,2.8193,0.3308,1.2988,3.6187,2.7173,3.748,0.7074,3.3574,3.6541,4.7582,5.8807,1.7281,2.9229,1.0083,1.7154,2.1177,4.9543,2.7491,3.828,1.7891,0.3918,1.1716,0.014,0.7795,2.0185,0.0425,1.2073,0.062,2.0293,2.4349,1.1203,4.8006,1.024,5.624,1.1679,0.7209,0.6709,0.4525,2.5153,3.936,6.1552,3.4061,2.485,0.2991,0.0079,3.5294,0.4914,3.394,0.511,6.0246,3.9628,4.093,0.5947,0.6842,2.5787,1.4739,0.9344,6.137,1.2289,1.5308,4.6418,2.3718,1.9496,1.0382,4.4108,0.0181,3.3462,0.8705,4.1806,1.0274,4.0583,1.4851,1.154,2.9331,3.5436,1.1156,1.7694,1.0457,1.3192,1.4314,1.837,0.9055,3.6117,1.3537,1.5685,1.3127,4.8139,5.1327,0.1406,2.0928,6.5774,1.5392,1.0063,3.8003,3.6048,1.3601,1.5806,0.6863,0.6458,3.2228,1.0351,0.1086,0.3718,0.57,0.7491,3.5945,1.1185,4.2771,4.7132,1.0089,2.6733,0.3576,1.4581,2.2807,4.3144,2.9494,6.768,1.8307,3.7056,0.4494,4.025,6.7072,0.6891,0.8323,1.4162,8.1346,2.8195,1.6242,4.1684,0.1401,0.0238,5.5476,1.8546,6.3288,2.0344,2.7605,3.5034,0.0163,0.0143,3.5414,2.899,4.4896,1.5946,3.2876,0.0007,2.1707,11.1886,3.1067,5.8309,1.0291,2.133,5.1853,1.78,2.7621,2.7854,1.1889,4.7472,1.6821,3.9074,0.0048,0.0011,3.3098,6.7142,0.0441,4.7476,7.1921,0.6206,0.6781,6.2528,4.3065,4.7696,0.29,1.4152,0.952,5.3206,1.0138,3.7055,4.0112,6.4091,2.8278,3.4423,2.7177,2.6713,1.6896,1.7257,4.9272,1.6399,6.7441,5.6217,1.7686,0.341,0.1903]}
{"id":112,"ended":true,"length":422,"text":"With the censorship of Polish theater ( and the virtual end of the Polish radio and film industry ), underground theaters were created, primarily in Warsaw and Krak\u00f3w, with shows presented in different times \u2013 on television, radio, digital. Now in a much improved service, the company has decided to launch an all-new service of Polish theater cinema in Warsaw, with the launch of an all-new Polish theater cinema (which will be broadcast every Wednesday at midnight).\n\nOn the third Tuesday after the Polish-language movie festival, the Polish theater cinema is now a permanent venue and has received a significant and positive response from locals and audiences.\n\n\u201cIt is a step towards bringing modern theater to Poland\u2019s local market\u201d, says Konnietzesza Czarnienka. \u201cThis is a powerful strategy in front of a global public. We hope we will be able to deliver innovative theater theater in Warsaw that will be suitable for people everywhere.\u201d\n\nIn addition, in addition to providing a new range of television and radio showings, the Polish theatre cinema is providing a new entertainment platform in Poland. As part of its official launch party of the Polish theater and cinema cinema in Wroc\u0142aw\u2019s Civic Hall neighborhood, the Polish theatre cinema in Wroc\u0142aw, will present a new show in which more than 300 guests are invited to receive a free dinner or a free beverage.\n\nIn fact, one of the main attractions of this new cinema is a \u201ckleptographic\u201d installation which includes an interactive play and theatre with the title \u201cPogroma\u201d (pogroms), the Polish government\u2019s statement in the Polish parliament and the Ministry of Social and Religious Affairs in Wroc\u0142aw on the \u201cpogroms\u201d of 2012\/13 (\u201cthe future of Poland\u201d).\n\nThe play \u201cPogroma\u201d is an interactive exploration of \u201cpogroms\u201d and will include a discussion on how they occurred and the problems of freedom and society. It is presented in Wroc\u0142aw in the same way which was originally intended for the cinema club at the R.W.C., while the installation itself will feature a \u201cluminosity\u201d and \u201ccredible\u201d installation featuring artists from all genres. \u201cIt is a beautiful and inspiring performance and a powerful way for us to discuss the past,\u201d concludes Czarnienka.","token_len":513,"entropy":[2.3156,11.5427,1.5069,9.9829,8.107,5.2397,7.9472,2.0834,9.1789,8.678,0.4093,1.3628,2.5686,6.9727,2.6265,4.3757,1.0916,2.2373,9.3572,4.4209,2.4706,4.43,2.2359,5.7992,1.2797,2.6972,1.436,3.0598,0.0137,1.6265,0.0009,1.424,3.3001,8.3164,7.1595,1.6681,4.2818,5.9969,6.3975,5.2359,3.1262,0.4747,1.1844,0.5074,7.2403,4.1034,5.1793,4.6513,3.8403,4.8393,4.6336,8.1095,0.8926,2.1592,6.4889,1.8435,4.0548,0.149,4.3523,2.9096,3.2905,0.2924,1.6493,1.654,4.5362,1.9315,1.5026,7.0038,2.4045,2.9849,1.5292,2.8164,2.3131,5.1842,0.2278,2.6344,1.1713,0.0291,0.3396,3.4702,1.7588,2.4626,4.2528,4.4398,1.4202,0.8597,4.7663,4.4125,3.054,2.1364,4.5422,2.2271,0.9506,0.0119,4.7859,1.4988,5.3696,4.6366,4.3302,0.6998,3.4725,4.736,0.9072,4.3856,3.5278,1.0052,1.3294,2.3076,1.5677,2.1775,3.1336,3.5851,3.8878,3.7831,3.1843,3.3196,3.7103,5.0731,1.8411,4.1767,6.031,2.9517,0.8568,0.6971,6.2598,1.6018,3.425,0.6788,1.7196,0.0003,9.7759,7.9614,6.1832,1.0221,2.1827,5.2376,2.22,3.6592,7.1091,3.0505,1.218,1.867,5.4275,7.3977,7.8315,5.4556,2.7021,1.8432,7.7859,3.0924,5.1463,6.5671,7.3329,5.4725,7.9305,6.7496,5.768,1.0419,2.8146,6.6842,2.6595,2.2505,4.8315,0.2678,3.29,1.1748,1.1802,6.4771,7.4805,3.6924,7.1139,0.0065,2.308,4.17,5.5655,2.0419,2.8515,2.1291,4.3695,1.1335,1.9776,0.1604,0.0119,4.7965,6.2483,2.9422,3.969,1.4836,2.4101,3.9483,0.9626,1.8869,5.6318,0.1468,4.3232,4.0732,1.0231,2.9184,4.6992,0.4721,0.0002,4.0854,1.8363,1.0144,3.7255,2.9985,0.0402,3.9004,1.299,2.083,6.8494,0.0147,6.6448,1.0695,0.7938,4.7255,1.9485,0.5564,0.924,1.1202,2.7194,0.8897,1.6831,4.9236,1.3184,1.2454,5.142,2.1647,3.1209,2.3641,1.0756,4.3648,2.4672,0.0017,2.3078,6.5292,4.5324,6.2125,3.384,1.4975,1.5953,1.1288,5.0822,2.2097,3.3035,3.4058,6.123,2.4998,0.0184,0.0685,12.9263,1.7174,1.9243,5.5579,6.7341,8.6734,0.4418,0.9172,1.2249,1.682,0.8247,3.2843,1.1327,0.0588,0.0037,0.0112,3.0486,2.5956,4.1107,1.687,0.8197,2.7795,3.1652,4.7411,6.2758,0.5504,3.5977,3.7598,2.7837,0.7337,0.2649,5.8482,1.4799,2.2783,5.6268,3.8014,1.7359,2.8337,4.3577,0.995,0.7962,0.0002,3.1478,4.7588,0.0768,4.901,0.4491,0.102,2.1114,2.2572,0.3084,2.2392,0.799,4.5302,1.3973,3.1396,13.3136,0.8592,7.7647,5.5469,0.8339,5.88,2.0318,2.6002,5.2219,2.9858,3.7224,2.8412,2.1173,4.8684,2.6089,5.5422,3.5661,3.4374,6.3425,3.2259,0.1333,5.0299,6.0286,8.3404,2.6638,1.3031,3.3492,3.5985,1.2147,1.1614,1.1595,2.8558,3.2902,1.4167,6.4578,7.0854,4.2605,0.3219,6.6282,4.1087,1.8095,1.8607,3.0553,3.6856,1.4459,5.7204,0.0318,4.9592,3.8675,4.1516,0.068,3.0008,3.1545,0.0489,0.0021,0.0055,4.2678,1.3922,7.457,0.182,2.7334,0.0938,0.1578,0.4984,2.2561,0.445,3.3627,6.559,5.869,0.8199,3.8741,5.9748,0.9775,4.408,7.1541,0.6509,1.7184,1.5227,4.5531,0.868,0.5892,0.0002,2.0381,3.91,2.4136,0.0098,0.6316,0.0483,0.1358,0.2838,0.0063,1.6329,2.5316,1.5994,8.7464,0.2411,5.5451,0.0335,2.0469,0.1578,0.2765,0.2186,1.5234,0.1288,2.4031,5.6407,3.5159,1.6889,5.3522,2.246,3.7191,3.4439,5.3379,1.2546,1.9013,5.7751,2.595,7.6157,1.5591,6.2457,1.6636,2.5146,1.7201,3.82,0.866,6.811,0.0461,0.0028,0.0039,2.5488,1.8602,2.9073,2.1237,6.4615,2.7243,4.6232,3.0469,1.2042,1.2703,4.7329,7.4899,3.3816,0.8437,6.093,3.698,2.9489,0.1551,3.7083,3.3659,5.3982,1.2176,4.4212,5.1293,2.2303,3.6485,1.3224,5.5081,0.0256,5.1931,3.8971,3.8334,0.2272,0.1553,3.2698,4.6799,0.0207,4.6085,7.7276,1.4053,0.0208,5.5738,4.5705,6.3719,2.496,2.4591,4.5842,1.3278,3.726,0.0254,2.5045,0.9738,1.303,3.8805,2.3744,4.2168,4.6613,3.0083,2.5185,4.5294,2.8187,1.9885,2.9349,0.2314,5.2728,1.2628,3.4661,1.4207,9.3625,2.0311,8.9614,2.317,0.1219,0.0011,0.0498,0.0067,0.2453]}
{"id":405,"ended":false,"length":458,"text":"Of the British rear ships, only two made a determined effort to break the French line. Admiral Hood's flagship HMS Royal George pierced it between R\u00e9publicain and Sans Pareil, engaging both French and British vessels in a continuous attack. Although both British ships suffered losses they still survived, the Royal George suffered considerable losses against French vessels, resulting in their loss of seven British warship and their loss of six more ships \u2013 including HMS Royal George (Cobras) \u2013. The total damage totaled $21.1 million and the losses were $25m and $25m respectively.\n\nHMS Royal George\n\nHMS Royal George was launched in 1965 and completed two years later. The French had been engaged in French warship operations that had earlier resulted in her death. In 1966 She sailed on to France to assist with the rescue of the French hostage on the island of Venezia. Admiral Hood fought a successful expedition to the French island of Lacothe in order to surrender, the last of the French hostages that had been held on the island, due to their resistance. The following year she was rescued by French forces with the rescue missions undertaken by British coast guard and merchant ship of the same name. She was decommissioned on 30 June 1968, as a result of the accident.\n\nAeromex\n\nHer crew survived in a number of ways. When their ships were attacked in 1968 it allowed for repairs and the use of replacement parts to repair the ageing and damaged ship. In 1971 they converted their ships, which had earlier been fitted only with the use of steel beams, which served as the primary means of damage free-hand navigation between a port and the sea. The ship was then replaced again with twin steel beams of a design and function similar to that of the Royal George. On 15 August 1969 it was converted into two aircraft hangar-style aircraft hangar systems. These systems were used as the basis for the successful transfer of her operational, financial, and construction programme to the RAF.\n\nIn 1971, it was commissioned into the Royal Navy. It did not manage to escape any combat conditions. It was still in command at that time in the same ship which was still undergoing maintenance.

From a position of relative prosperity, John's coal and iron business had encountered difficulties and he had been left on the sidelines between 1861 and 1862, after a long struggle with \"dragged and broken off his business, and being a subject of an immense number of complaints, many of which were directed against his father, and being treated more severely than every other man in the village.\" By the summer 1886, he had been discharged from hospital and moved to St Albans.\n\nAt this time, Hornung and five of his friends were engaged in a military conflict in the English Channel. Their position of importance was placed directly on the line between the Netherlands and the United States because the war in the East was to be to stop. Hornung was one of his men and, after a bitter battle with Admiral Sir Michael Pearsley of the New France that was to last five years, he secured the right and control of the entire North Rhine-Westphalia south coast from New York. Hornung's command was to \"control the movement of his crew and soldiers, or at least his men\". In addition to this, Hornung was tasked with recruiting the English, French and Spanish colonies and the army of the U.S, both of which were already in danger of being disbanded. When their ships were attacked in New York at Port James, Hornung tried to bring their ships out of the harbor, but when they were about to embark on a landing, he was able to \"break through the front with which they were going at that time and cut the ship in half\" and put the remaining four aboard the corvette. Hornung was also the commander of the \"smaller fleet vessels\" which was to carry out the American and British missions.\n\nWhile the U.S. government was seeking to secure European colonization and had secured the territories of the U.S. in 1789, the threat of an armed conflict remained strong despite it being a part-time occupation. Hornung and his crew had to do much damage to protect their ships and ports. They attempted to set fires which destroyed four of their ships, leaving at least 19 people dead and over 25 injured. By January 1885, he was seriously injured in the attack and his injuries were considered major. On July 23, 1887, he died of a head wound and was buried in a village near his home in St Albans.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links","token_len":513,"entropy":[8.2399,9.9978,10.7358,0.5427,5.9152,1.7357,4.1563,8.4828,1.0359,5.4447,2.138,4.1232,0.0419,0.6765,1.4722,3.1551,4.9272,1.8489,6.0143,4.0782,4.2711,0.8357,4.3176,5.0257,0.7484,8.592,3.5057,9.2507,2.7311,1.25,2.9777,2.4743,10.361,1.4253,2.6972,1.7512,1.792,2.4403,4.4828,4.2658,0.9898,4.347,6.6216,6.5737,0.1219,2.0876,1.5231,4.2322,2.7469,2.66,3.5568,0.7459,6.6419,7.2451,4.2995,4.0165,4.4512,5.2387,5.1103,5.1254,3.5016,1.3038,5.0939,3.7913,5.1912,0.4314,4.6687,4.4688,3.8063,0.0361,4.5855,1.8067,5.466,0.3571,0.6094,0.929,4.7473,1.1083,2.0646,3.254,1.4825,1.4763,5.1548,4.9468,5.4354,3.7908,0.655,6.7629,0.299,1.3853,1.4568,0.7847,5.1852,1.13,4.783,1.4559,4.8354,8.7626,0.6033,1.8394,0.6178,1.7878,3.7118,0.3412,6.2755,1.1265,4.1257,0.4905,4.0322,4.2104,0.0012,2.0234,1.7939,0.0029,3.9905,2.5149,0.5933,0.7207,6.5395,0.0012,4.055,7.314,1.6048,0.0464,2.093,1.5229,3.8388,0.2238,1.2925,5.9498,4.9511,2.3042,1.3965,5.0616,2.1855,0.8076,3.768,4.8987,3.9936,4.5338,0.8505,6.106,6.6143,2.8189,0.299,1.9523,3.2677,1.385,5.5343,0.0845,1.2264,3.3024,1.7836,5.613,2.1112,4.8147,3.46,0.9173,3.8481,1.5129,4.371,0.5987,8.0135,6.1763,6.6169,2.7044,0.0004,1.8641,3.8599,0.0163,5.2051,4.4272,1.8825,3.0473,3.0107,2.2264,5.5385,1.6267,1.3658,7.6844,5.3733,5.1392,4.8464,5.2434,4.6164,3.3561,0.348,4.8173,5.9416,7.1525,3.1492,0.9464,1.6084,3.9457,1.1141,0.1156,1.4559,5.9732,1.4242,2.4745,5.4889,6.6372,0.3094,0.531,4.9258,5.7374,7.5794,0.0016,0.8496,0.0486,0.0017,0.0374,8.4392,4.8275,3.504,4.0412,0.8394,2.818,3.2248,0.0007,1.925,5.5704,1.569,2.3758,5.5621,5.4021,0.9234,4.0147,0.2718,4.8145,6.0808,1.7222,6.2196,1.9302,5.1743,3.2468,0.3224,3.3942,2.7576,6.2211,2.8707,2.7618,0.6853,2.1986,0.5483,2.2964,0.0005,1.4795,5.3001,0.0911,5.8158,2.7324,3.3849,3.7946,4.0133,0.9015,4.7164,7.2575,2.3575,3.1871,5.572,1.395,1.034,4.7868,0.0827,0.0799,6.8401,5.0902,0.904,0.2032,1.1788,3.6803,1.8972,4.1632,0.7201,0.768,5.7767,0.7747,4.7365,6.1476,4.9649,1.0184,2.5653,2.3831,4.3846,0.3419,5.2818,5.3018,6.5954,0.7235,1.6805,0.0007,6.1182,0.1748,4.9626,3.955,1.3661,2.6866,0.5709,0.7189,0.8436,1.9941,0.4189,4.4609,1.7757,1.7293,5.4013,0.1022,4.3173,1.5135,1.426,4.354,1.4864,0.9571,0.8557,5.0377,0.0245,4.4907,5.1642,2.9968,1.0281,5.44,4.8958,7.5984,1.3389,0.5716,3.7314,4.2151,2.6625,0.3947,2.6503,4.7323,2.4619,3.4406,2.6881,1.4922,3.4853,1.2051,4.3169,1.602,3.9687,4.016,3.2933,2.2808,8.0078,0.4049,0.9536,2.8908,0.0012,1.6648,3.0007,3.718,3.6092,0.1823,0.8058,3.0986,6.5184,3.388,3.3094,9.2768,1.1263,1.7398,4.6144,0.9978,3.6709,2.652,0.9009,5.7228,2.8779,0.8962,3.5696,1.3893,0.8829,0.0002,4.2186,1.8101,3.2152,0.0012,0.0053,0.0529,3.6442,1.0125,5.9192,0.819,3.1907,7.1283,6.268,2.6827,4.8476,4.7318,1.5186,6.2789,0.8042,1.1128,3.2376,0.0018,0.3463,0.5131,3.5879,4.2329,2.3198,0.2669,1.424,6.3606,0.3924,3.0698,3.9556,1.9413,5.856,3.9731,6.4505,5.3101,0.8889,1.9789,5.4017,7.7088,0.4733,1.3908,0.5912,2.7834,0.0022,2.593,0.3779,2.115,2.5833,2.1532,4.8954,3.8637,4.6443,0.4905,5.0094,0.8898,2.7354,1.3281,8.945,1.529,2.8394,5.7396,0.2214,4.1324,4.3263,6.1449,2.8282,5.2386,1.5521,0.9355,0.9752,1.3869,4.3507,5.3989,0.0143,5.5136,2.6542,0.4891,1.078,3.813,4.4657,1.5936,0.2719,4.3586,4.8747,0.7004,2.4369,0.1704,4.206,1.1,5.1425,1.3119,1.7438,1.8631,2.7333,2.3261,2.8643,5.5069,0.844,3.8672,4.2655,1.1542,3.2198,3.3041,3.6334,0.3859,0.5538,1.7759,0.0666,1.405,2.1186,1.2737,1.3607,3.6802,0.1744,2.5961,1.8564,0.5988,0.875,2.1266,5.6956,1.4283,2.8874,1.1376,0.9888,3.3297,1.0722,0.0002,0.419,0.6943,0.0002,5.7378,0.9231,0.0002,6.4547,0.8429]}

The Portuguese government, fearing the attack, kept them under control and, by late January, 1948, the death toll reached 17,000 (more than 1,500 civilians ). The last defeat was not only a setback to the Portuguese military as a whole, but its defeat to Brazil - the worst possible outcome for the Portuguese. The Portuguese fought a \"bloody battle\", they say, which had to be carried on the battlefield by the \"hardest troops\".\n\nBut there were other reasons to fight in the south. Portuguese soldiers had to fight harder, with less difficulty. As part of a broader strategy to counter the British colonial and French navies, their Portuguese allies were forced to reduce their strength. They were obliged to leave their Portuguese colonies, leaving behind vast amounts of territory in which to attack. More importantly, they were forced to leave their Portuguese colonies, giving the Portuguese another major military advantage over the Portuguese and its allies. With the end of their colonial colonial domination, the Portuguese also became less likely to accept US foreign aid which they needed to combat the British and French wars (like they were used to doing).\n\nThere were other reasons to fight in the south. Portuguese soldiers were forced to abandon British forces in the area where they had been stationed. The Portuguese made many sacrifices during the first half of the War, to preserve European relations and prevent the British from breaking away, as well as the Portuguese. They also fought with the support of the French, in the fight for a position in the Portuguese territories and in the conquest of the territories of Portugal, as well as against British forces in the Portuguese colony areas.\n\nFor the Portuguese, though, it was the death toll of the war itself, and not the defeat itself, that mattered most. After the last attack on Portugal, the Portuguese had made it clear they would not fight another \"pre-emptive\" war, and they were not afraid of a defeat to the British or its allies.","token_len":513,"entropy":[2.5476,8.8575,1.5103,3.6565,0.2057,6.9812,9.1963,5.4107,4.2392,2.1103,4.7232,3.9121,3.1771,1.7914,6.7764,2.3164,3.4878,1.5827,3.3758,3.3062,4.8096,10.0731,4.8063,5.7277,2.4563,5.3201,1.2619,10.6234,0.5085,0.9515,5.8246,5.2741,5.6281,0.5532,11.4804,1.1709,5.6991,6.3652,4.9876,1.9495,1.2124,5.3541,2.3572,5.3316,6.0213,5.1114,8.0024,1.1706,4.1969,2.1114,1.6241,1.1899,2.6867,5.2481,3.3293,6.2528,0.6949,4.3139,0.4903,3.0702,4.1786,5.6251,1.0998,2.8183,1.5904,4.6698,3.9892,4.8139,6.0954,2.1602,2.7627,0.0273,1.4552,5.4137,1.2451,0.9456,0.0212,2.7578,4.8362,0.0036,1.2893,6.0069,3.1456,1.4871,5.132,5.8339,5.2829,4.0127,1.6404,0.6697,3.08,0.5019,1.1343,0.9288,5.2335,0.2652,5.3973,1.3332,2.5834,6.6942,2.4222,5.9183,5.5353,5.8897,0.4597,3.0304,4.1664,4.1532,3.6589,1.2118,3.9043,2.7178,0.0328,8.4626,0.5013,1.9117,2.4092,5.1136,2.2438,4.4833,2.0854,5.5092,1.1121,5.659,4.4226,3.5813,2.3279,2.7605,3.4891,3.21,2.8987,3.1806,0.3553,4.6467,0.0623,2.4292,7.0805,0.1513,4.0746,4.8202,0.5122,1.3071,4.0349,3.999,0.2358,3.3882,0.3101,1.9672,3.6281,8.2296,1.8932,4.9807,6.0398,1.9142,3.8233,3.7278,1.6019,3.4902,1.8508,0.509,1.8631,3.0969,5.4922,0.3097,0.0583,0.2873,0.2583,5.5322,3.494,4.7022,6.9603,6.7555,1.9977,4.5718,4.9948,1.1404,0.7324,0.7601,2.8685,1.6871,2.5457,2.6437,5.8542,2.7538,4.9478,5.8261,1.3501,2.1581,1.7332,4.6516,4.0342,0.2922,2.7781,3.8328,2.6302,0.2329,5.3507,1.9827,5.9944,3.1392,3.3686,1.655,3.3008,5.6491,2.4157,3.7555,2.1986,1.0195,0.0003,4.5922,3.6938,1.9116,1.901,1.8982,2.2803,3.9364,3.062,0.5062,2.0305,0.7399,6.5643,2.7569,2.0204,2.4129,2.167,4.896,1.6436,4.4659,3.5359,4.8809,1.7812,3.6468,4.9689,0.0008,1.9938,4.0123,1.5441,1.2348,2.7271,0.7395,3.1271,5.6644,4.866,3.8387,7.1192,0.0005,0.2971,4.7454,5.737,2.5125,1.7028,3.6739,0.155,6.0567,0.6165,4.0735,2.323,3.064,1.5318,5.0009,0.1045,4.6612,1.9143,5.0752,3.5319,1.8926,3.8443,2.0479,5.4959,3.329,0.0024,2.7461,2.5927,3.9819,0.4623,2.8651,1.3029,6.0857,1.4941,0.0558,1.2669,0.8128,0.7895,0.0665,3.412,1.2831,2.9186,1.7775,1.5717,5.5453,1.4652,1.0123,5.0401,3.8938,3.0387,1.4791,2.4805,0.6168,3.8869,4.3183,4.2787,0.9044,0.3802,4.7261,1.1759,3.4242,0.0081,4.0403,2.3075,6.3758,4.7233,0.4062,0.7383,0.1053,5.4036,2.9539,2.4719,2.8861,0.0441,4.6501,5.9664,5.4477,1.8863,6.2509,1.9074,5.1162,0.3214,4.5285,0.62,1.0679,2.4171,1.5323,4.9832,4.9463,5.5871,4.8545,1.8571,5.3743,0.034,3.4184,3.7377,0.8515,0.0002,4.8969,1.0057,1.9173,0.9793,0.86,0.6501,0.3636,0.0368,0.4142,0.8349,4.0476,1.7728,1.2319,2.5304,0.1226,5.2248,6.3323,3.8987,1.3624,0.6646,5.2195,2.7946,0.8584,0.8297,1.1709,2.027,1.2281,2.0039,2.1522,5.5136,3.6265,3.7216,3.3476,0.4987,4.4695,2.0755,0.017,0.3028,4.7193,0.9439,4.4138,3.8427,7.6329,5.3373,1.7271,4.2814,1.1267,1.6593,0.9089,6.213,3.4442,3.3402,3.2803,1.1638,0.009,3.1832,4.4566,6.2322,2.885,1.2253,3.4802,2.7032,2.1755,4.2763,0.0254,1.1052,2.1857,1.4192,3.931,1.7518,4.2316,2.0191,3.9078,5.4202,0.7969,0.5602,4.8796,3.3624,3.9134,1.2044,0.4525,5.7812,0.0363,1.2383,5.3761,0.9335,3.1231,2.1876,3.1695,0.2312,0.0049,3.5758,2.8638,0.921,1.1794,0.3942,4.4075,4.9429,4.4897,0.5593,1.0357,0.0002,4.3121,1.301,1.2627,0.3846,6.0799,0.158,2.7767,0.2789,2.0235,4.6017,1.62,2.2116,0.4398,0.809,5.4029,1.9575,1.7971,2.0954,0.5211,2.3861,2.834,0.197,0.2359,4.4507,1.6192,0.2037,3.693,0.9089,5.3853,6.0053,0.9167,2.3948,0.9339,0.9587,0.6745,2.3154,4.3382,2.4026,0.5089,1.5079,0.8773,0.8794,4.0111,3.5381,4.6533,5.6917,0.2119,0.0031,0.0007,0.2622,0.0834,1.8222,1.7214,1.836,1.684,3.1753,4.294,0.8943,3.0623,3.2108,4.7425,1.4461,0.893,2.2013,6.0914,0.2488,0.3246]}
{"id":194,"ended":false,"length":452,"text":"In 1960, Ronald William Clark published a biography titled Sir Mortimer Wheeler. FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan reviewed the volume for the journal Man, describing `` this very readable little book'', which became known as \"The Mortimer Wheeler Book\" (1951).\n\nIn 1971, John S. Lister made two attempts to publish a biography of the late Sir Charles Lister \"Sir M.W.\"  Lister did not succeed.\n\nThe first attempt was by John B. Lister to edit the volume, in which Richard E. Lee described the book as \"full of remarkable tales of M.W.L.\"  Lister wrote two more versions of the book which were published in 1973 and 1976, respectively. The second attempt was by William B. Lister to edit the volume, which he did not succeed in his effort to produce a third edition of the volumes.\n\nIn 1995, the Charles Lister Society published a volume in which Richard P. G. Lister was interviewed in the presence of Professor Lister, in addition to Professor Lister also speaking on Lister's death. The book was written by E. H. Aitkenberg, Ph.D., in accordance with the rules of the National Library of Australia.\n\nOn April 9, 2000. A special meeting was held in Canberra in which more than 300 members of the Lister Society spoke before the Council of Ministers, at the same time that Australia was being subjected to considerable media criticism and increased concern about the secrecy of Lister's death, which prompted the publication of a letter announcing the publication of the book to the Senate.  The Australian government and the Commonwealth Commission for Forensic Sciences were subsequently advised in early 2000 that the manuscript of the book would need to be preserved at the Victorian Library at the behest of the Bureau of Archives and Research, as it had been left unreleased from the release.

{"id":4264,"ended":true,"length":483,"text":"Cancer screening uses medical tests to detect disease in large groups of people who have no symptoms. For individuals with high risk of developing lung cancer, computed tomography ( CT ) screening can confirm that a patient has a chronic lung disease. CT can also tell a person\u2019s history of lung cancer, and its causes. CT can also be used for detecting other types of cancer that contribute to lung cancer, such as cancerous sores and cancerous lesions.\n\nCT scans can also be used to identify those cancers that pose a greater risk for cancer.\n\nThe screening test is a unique and unique approach that is currently used in both research and cancer treatment. Based on the science of the cancer and the human patient, the test is often prescribed in certain regions. However, because most people don\u2019t have the diagnosis of cancer in their lifetime and are at a much lower risk of developing it, the test is difficult to use successfully in large groups of people.\n\nA CT scan is available in most areas of the world, which may include all 50 states of the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The test includes a CT scan and a blood test for the cancer cells, which means it is extremely expensive. At the same time, there have been few reports of the test being used in larger populations, particularly in low-income countries.\n\nMedical testing is less expensive than surgery. If it is used, the diagnostic values can be verified in more precise ways and therefore are available to the entire medical community. For example, the CT scanner used in the study in Ireland can detect certain types of cancer at a much higher accuracy than the CT scanner used in the United States or the U.K.. Furthermore, by the way, these tests have been proven to be reliable in most cancers, even those that are associated with lung cancer.\n\nIn fact, the main cause of lung cancer in the U.S. is lung cancer, and it is estimated that this rate of incidence among adult adults is expected to rise by about 15 % every decade.\n\nFor the use of any diagnostic tool that is needed to detect lung cancer, it is important that it is capable of being tested in small, clinical settings where it is not possible to test it alone.\n\nThe use of CT in diagnosis and treatment of cancer, therefore, must be considered when evaluating whether it can be used with other types of cancer and the screening test, because those testing a particular type of cancer need to be made aware of any possible complications.","token_len":514,"entropy":[9.7851,7.9549,7.5796,6.8195,5.3119,0.9706,2.1991,5.4693,2.9077,7.0672,2.7393,0.533,0.816,3.4574,1.179,3.5386,3.1769,1.128,4.2098,5.7094,0.7693,3.7868,2.0118,0.919,2.0693,4.4868,0.085,0.2388,10.7646,0.0007,0.0321,0.5253,11.9246,0.1451,2.1553,2.0823,4.6147,2.1426,2.4425,2.3507,0.8249,1.3662,4.6053,1.9236,0.4563,0.8182,3.0427,3.8563,0.714,4.1695,3.1251,1.1034,15.8337,8.4688,5.4523,4.8731,0.4139,2.0766,0.2481,1.8156,2.7602,4.8894,4.2772,0.842,3.0812,1.2905,0.336,2.4702,0.1605,2.6577,4.6392,3.1491,3.7269,0.0018,0.7433,3.1856,6.7918,0.0382,0.9846,0.1405,1.4978,0.2566,0.0033,2.6946,3.1076,5.8779,3.4213,2.0694,3.1914,0.4985,2.7019,0.4113,1.1537,0.0006,3.7993,2.6001,1.2104,1.1797,1.2223,0.1174,0.3644,2.1409,4.5929,5.3365,0.4654,4.8414,0.4667,3.699,0.3411,1.7778,3.1079,1.9325,2.5195,0.0002,2.6278,4.3648,4.1715,1.76,2.9841,5.1692,2.5036,4.0887,3.656,1.957,2.2914,4.7076,1.6334,1.43,4.9751,4.7264,0.0909,7.1392,2.1806,0.385,7.392,0.0446,1.1736,6.1065,1.5283,1.8549,3.7965,2.5734,1.2642,4.1383,5.5357,0.1757,1.4923,3.4702,1.5488,3.6259,6.0549,2.4297,6.7065,5.6335,3.1059,2.7834,0.0079,3.0439,4.0261,1.8219,3.5662,5.4997,1.0724,0.3281,1.1709,1.9878,6.1958,1.0571,1.6774,2.1797,0.6057,2.3729,3.8733,2.4665,5.0238,2.0327,3.067,1.335,0.0255,0.8222,0.4444,0.8968,0.3967,1.6082,1.9221,1.0176,6.0376,0.2264,1.2509,6.0961,1.6393,3.527,1.2358,0.3736,0.2383,0.3331,0.8695,0.0002,3.6351,4.0564,0.4153,1.3798,5.0258,2.1733,3.0128,3.6183,0.4302,0.194,1.908,1.308,4.9708,3.6458,2.2582,4.6628,2.8781,0.5254,3.2579,0.1627,1.3006,0.0004,0.0012,0.6636,1.5027,3.8112,0.0003,0.3691,1.8906,2.5912,4.4978,1.1683,3.8728,0.5373,3.1225,1.0182,3.1079,1.1302,2.9293,2.3056,3.4011,4.1245,2.5288,1.0961,5.6226,2.6555,1.0309,4.86,4.0696,1.0505,5.8634,1.1109,1.3467,0.002,0.0417,3.0561,4.7589,0.0388,3.9514,3.1982,0.2557,3.4799,2.7122,0.4774,0.4679,0.8624,4.972,2.8418,1.9074,3.8308,0.6394,4.8981,0.2325,0.1322,0.711,0.733,0.6486,0.0002,6.2137,3.4091,1.348,6.5356,1.3303,0.7607,5.1354,1.5973,4.5505,4.5143,0.4801,2.1709,1.9947,1.5455,6.1967,8.3182,1.9055,0.2626,4.8761,2.8931,4.0796,3.7281,0.8377,2.9937,6.3506,2.0791,4.2205,1.3802,1.7588,4.755,3.4167,0.1999,0.2928,3.1117,0.5227,0.0145,2.4125,2.545,3.8351,3.5245,0.7776,1.3185,2.3924,2.6853,7.3212,2.396,1.8955,4.9632,1.3107,0.0034,0.7444,3.7735,1.3466,1.7616,2.0116,4.2966,0.276,0.9424,1.0667,1.4455,0.3036,0.1516,0.4786,2.6044,0.0606,4.484,2.1376,2.6345,0.0005,0.3832,6.4629,5.5491,0.001,5.7294,4.4883,4.1782,0.035,4.5178,2.5953,3.0038,0.9107,3.8914,0.2744,0.563,3.2362,1.6572,4.215,3.6655,1.6684,3.3211,1.7403,0.7013,1.0304,4.8443,0.0104,3.4349,0.187,0.3179,0.3176,0.0002,2.9899,3.9086,0.0034,1.5447,5.8162,4.6125,0.1022,1.3556,0.0393,1.3406,1.3886,0.6731,0.0005,0.0158,0.2277,0.1853,4.788,0.3707,1.9612,2.2708,2.3406,0.3765,1.7521,0.0454,6.3009,4.2695,2.481,4.5668,3.9508,6.3754,4.4614,0.7774,5.8558,0.0042,1.8081,2.4147,2.2806,3.3346,5.822,4.5038,1.8522,1.0695,1.4046,0.0003,4.0843,2.2876,5.8842,0.0472,5.4764,3.6377,2.7383,2.5284,1.333,5.1803,0.7542,2.0027,1.1251,0.0378,0.3338,2.7127,0.2509,0.8431,1.3112,2.3472,0.7373,6.2942,0.0342,2.3247,4.2314,1.5733,3.7897,2.0504,3.6284,1.2187,3.4663,2.0145,0.5452,1.9802,1.7656,0.3755,3.0677,2.7766,4.3905,0.3121,1.2708,0.0002,2.2292,2.3508,0.0071,1.6424,2.6642,5.6565,1.2112,0.2429,0.7337,1.6142,3.8247,5.573,0.0402,3.6405,0.3198,2.7166,2.3408,2.7109,2.9436,3.3246,2.6086,0.25,0.3098,3.8941,1.8578,3.1706,0.0025,1.6876,4.5187,3.8781,6.3846,1.0415,3.2631,4.4042,4.8427,5.5593,5.7972,1.7446,0.322,0.2627,0.0839,4.8118,0.6784,0.2631,5.0932,0.7025,0.1263,4.1352,2.7652,3.366,1.7196]}

In addition, five recipients who names were not included on the list have been awarded the Order of the Star.\n\nThe highest decoration currently presented to the fallen heroes of the Vietnam War is the Medal of Honor, issued in recognition of bravery, fighting and sacrifice through the years. A Medal of Honor is an award for courage, determination, devotion and personal sacrifices.\n\nIn recognition of those who have served, the recipient of the Medal of Honor is given a certificate of appreciation and a new certificate of personal and grandeur. The certificate of appreciation is distributed only to soldiers who have shown the bravery of their service.\n\nThe Medal of Honor was established in 1953 as a military honor to Honor service members for their bravery in action during the conflict with Japan.

{"id":3422,"ended":true,"length":491,"text":"In November 2009, it was reported that Stanton would reprise her role as Jill. Digital Spy forum members had previously pointed out that her return was hinted at in a photo on the web that showed her in a new outfit. Although, she has always been quite \"fun-loving\" about the characters, she is a complete doll, she just doesn't seem to be very well-adjusted. She gets a bit of her personality from the look of the outfit itself. The outfit has a pretty plain shirt, and it has nothing at all resembling a girly shirt. The shirt has a red color and pattern along with some type of collar, which is all that is printed.\n\nSo the picture is from 2010, but the dress was originally from 2009. It was a rather simple sleeveless dress to compliment it. The outfit is very similar to what you would expect to see in a women's dress. However, the \"pink\" pattern seems to be worn on the top half and that is very different to what is actually printed underneath. It looks more like a chino shirt and there is no neckline whatsoever.\n\nAs far as I know, she only appears in the same outfit every time in movies where she is in the costume, as opposed to wearing it on one of her outings. The photos that we saw in her performance certainly make fun of the outfit, although it is not something that you take lightly.\n\nIn fact, one of the photos of both Jill and Stanton is of her wearing a different dress this year. During the shoot, they had very closeups which showed their hands on the dress and that is why they had a very closeup. They were also quite nice in the picture, and the way that they were holding their hands on the dress was hilarious.\n\nIt is too soon to say if anything has changed to this photo. But from what we saw in the picture, the dress is exactly like the dress that the actress was wearing in her performance on January 2009. Stanton was in a bright yellow dress that was just her blue and black jacket. The outfit is a little bit different in contrast to that of Jill. So it is unlikely that they were playing with paint at the time.\n\nIf she wanted to keep the dress from looking too nice, her choice would definitely be to keep it the same colour as the dress. This would also be a nice change to make for the performance. After all, she has always been quite a doll and her looks have always been pretty good.","token_len":514,"entropy":[8.2994,4.0583,0.147,4.695,0.3665,1.0662,0.1526,11.2531,3.9568,6.169,2.5887,4.0105,0.131,0.3076,7.6545,4.1633,11.9204,2.0449,12.3269,2.6563,3.8433,4.088,5.0899,0.1384,0.2904,3.566,4.3325,1.9038,6.9555,0.1315,0.9659,1.5093,6.089,3.8322,1.3718,4.4465,3.6463,2.5537,0.7244,2.5162,1.1861,5.6686,2.3737,0.9875,5.7352,3.5788,2.6727,2.6166,3.8462,1.3696,4.9786,5.6043,4.9899,5.0012,0.3089,0.9408,2.2912,2.3327,5.6369,2.0946,1.5461,2.8472,3.6814,5.9549,7.5957,2.2088,3.8948,4.5926,2.2523,0.0014,2.4064,0.4834,2.166,2.9931,4.2975,1.3846,2.1288,0.8451,2.4095,5.7694,2.6363,3.126,1.9996,4.469,2.818,2.1405,1.9657,7.807,0.9525,2.053,4.2251,6.2833,1.4217,3.2792,3.191,2.6456,1.3401,4.8799,6.0564,6.0185,1.4453,2.1374,2.1815,1.6658,5.9065,4.4187,0.0114,3.6592,1.0288,6.391,0.9383,3.8307,0.5934,2.0752,3.1081,1.8949,0.9647,4.291,4.6923,1.9089,6.6651,5.1378,0.7167,3.1966,6.2214,0.0519,4.2389,1.8115,1.9908,1.3293,5.0947,2.696,1.5185,6.8933,3.3623,2.8419,0.0079,6.2413,4.0132,4.4628,2.2497,3.987,4.6801,0.9708,2.0859,2.042,4.188,2.6497,4.0896,2.4257,2.2851,0.645,2.0883,1.7379,3.2943,4.9513,3.5666,6.7047,0.0115,0.0001,1.691,5.44,6.8832,5.7775,1.1919,1.6838,3.7042,1.791,2.8355,2.8461,0.1714,3.1975,2.6611,1.826,2.0684,2.6987,0.247,0.8182,0.7238,6.0757,0.0532,2.2886,1.127,3.8315,0.0714,1.4253,5.4293,4.84,1.6477,1.1835,3.6072,5.1028,0.3681,0.6364,4.3288,1.7323,0.7099,3.2357,3.266,3.0328,5.3258,1.3979,4.0585,2.8829,2.7084,1.0941,3.1703,4.1526,2.7118,5.6212,0.4768,2.3042,2.686,2.3876,0.3085,0.5704,5.7236,3.2893,3.3237,2.5738,3.5698,0.5404,1.9651,4.5893,0.6035,4.1638,0.4944,1.7735,0.0002,4.4235,2.6255,0.0036,2.4229,0.9516,0.2229,2.6135,3.78,1.708,0.3398,1.4197,5.9071,1.3118,4.2133,1.6425,3.3906,5.639,4.6804,0.3354,1.0157,2.4477,1.2974,2.9066,1.8887,3.3902,2.807,0.0021,6.9606,1.4824,2.649,4.9519,1.5565,0.7285,5.1267,0.9204,2.8257,6.2375,2.8828,3.1943,1.3405,2.5008,3.5054,6.9168,6.7732,3.5821,8.5673,0.0165,2.5304,2.0716,1.1801,4.2327,1.6169,1.2473,1.7747,4.3358,0.8148,2.9555,7.4962,1.663,0.7155,1.2801,0.0002,3.1472,3.7856,0.0381,4.1703,0.5498,0.2286,3.3568,3.455,7.1947,2.3637,0.0982,1.8829,2.2425,1.8978,1.324,2.3019,0.8324,3.9637,2.8605,4.541,2.5835,0.5828,6.2703,0.8962,4.182,0.9282,3.0164,2.5649,5.4035,4.0885,4.6885,6.2487,2.2572,3.7479,4.8134,3.5031,1.6115,2.4594,2.4268,4.0132,2.4125,3.4131,1.6784,2.9013,2.282,2.6994,1.9484,0.787,3.1385,3.6369,2.4933,1.8151,3.6641,4.8146,2.988,1.199,3.4684,1.6432,2.6008,2.7869,3.7913,2.2373,0.6243,2.0011,2.6565,2.3818,0.6571,3.0943,0.2496,0.2646,1.5531,6.1865,0.322,0.8123,0.0001,3.2974,1.1279,6.4096,2.514,0.0278,0.6855,1.3611,5.4023,2.4404,0.2545,4.9616,2.551,4.4184,1.5484,4.0938,5.1769,0.7123,0.6568,2.2623,1.7511,0.55,2.3073,0.3341,2.4736,1.6435,1.4597,5.4851,3.0171,1.1685,2.6378,1.4744,3.4008,3.4565,2.7219,0.4444,1.2393,2.5054,1.996,3.6195,7.4117,7.7766,0.297,6.5979,2.5577,3.6504,1.3704,5.889,2.3076,0.9514,2.1553,1.2978,3.6464,5.6575,6.1553,3.1805,2.6978,4.9827,0.8898,1.8697,3.2775,1.6146,2.6769,2.421,2.2519,1.7707,3.0806,5.7652,0.6959,3.2652,1.425,2.2971,1.4119,5.8844,2.1447,0.8721,4.9767,0.1447,3.5792,2.549,5.54,1.7478,5.6045,5.0162,0.5926,0.1282,0.9303,0.6102,0.0002,3.786,3.7346,6.1798,0.1572,4.7492,1.608,2.3456,3.8113,4.7974,2.8352,5.4995,0.6472,4.4346,3.5661,0.8311,5.3748,1.0572,0.3608,3.8127,0.4081,4.1683,0.1951,3.4413,1.7412,1.0384,1.1871,1.2451,3.3694,1.5241,2.7141,2.0049,1.2583,2.4722,1.4479,2.2585,2.2383,1.9218,1.477,5.8027,0.8256,5.6802,0.128,0.0578,1.7725,2.1331,2.1675,0.5112,2.7942,2.1986,3.5817,1.9324,3.3017,3.7301,2.163,0.6369,0.2846,2.1244,2.593,0.3042]}

The book is a continuation of \"Nightwing\" as well as more action.\n\nThe novel series is known for it's humor, although the humor is not necessarily all that serious. In both novel series and the second book, Nightwing (2003-1999) many of the characters are very seriously wounded which can cause the series to be repetitive. When the characters are not well protected by the government the series becomes repetitive. In the beginning the series is slow and tense, but in the end the series becomes more intense with some of the villains leaving the series completely. The first book, written by Scott Pilgrim and Dan Bongino, can be finished. Dan Bongino's third book, \"Shadow of the Bat\" is a prequel to \"Nightwing\".\n\nIn the second book, Nightwing (2010-2011), the main character is killed by a car. In the second book, Nightwing loses a lot of his life during the fight, while his life revolves around the Bat. The third book, \"Shadow of the Bat\", has four villains: two men and two women. The fourth book, \"A New Way To Die, Part 2\", has five villains left dead.\n\nCharacters\n\nReferences\n\nSources","token_len":514,"entropy":[8.4611,3.3637,3.7204,7.0863,10.2435,9.7199,5.6699,1.9995,4.0588,1.19,8.9382,1.2015,8.1593,3.0693,14.9005,10.9398,1.9768,1.3923,3.5917,6.2917,3.4772,2.6016,5.2743,1.3174,5.4871,5.1319,2.2008,4.2935,2.5982,4.5527,0.7568,2.4005,4.9502,2.8441,1.9397,0.245,0.9091,4.9419,3.8165,4.5073,1.3422,1.51,1.1694,4.9047,0.5104,1.2186,6.0899,3.9869,0.6461,5.5608,1.1896,2.1574,5.6416,1.4071,3.4424,3.0118,0.4134,1.756,1.8568,3.8119,0.3226,6.4557,1.2335,0.43,2.1559,0.8565,5.8032,3.666,3.5182,5.0224,5.6196,3.5145,3.9503,2.1884,0.1407,3.0247,2.6267,3.9699,4.1413,4.4773,4.0973,2.738,2.1331,2.8405,4.1528,2.5147,2.6609,1.8302,5.3591,1.4581,4.6507,4.7845,4.2644,1.8901,2.0356,1.8891,3.7642,1.4396,4.8001,4.3393,5.6303,3.7639,4.219,5.577,0.7062,1.2512,3.8154,2.1603,0.4836,2.4802,4.4806,0.0796,1.13,3.31,0.4261,5.8454,3.852,3.5277,5.8219,1.2237,1.7034,7.5806,3.823,3.2636,5.1516,3.959,1.8743,1.1289,5.1823,1.444,3.9725,0.1316,6.8304,5.7456,2.8138,8.0166,0.1964,2.2708,2.5833,6.1215,4.671,2.1562,6.2338,4.6256,0.4149,5.7677,4.3369,4.3901,3.323,1.3372,3.5995,2.3863,3.2238,2.7394,1.7442,3.7659,4.3935,4.9261,1.0799,3.9455,1.6253,2.8969,2.4366,3.0433,0.2594,1.6318,6.702,6.8686,4.3363,6.1982,1.5169,5.2753,2.7625,2.6074,1.6473,2.7831,0.606,2.8056,4.7232,4.2198,2.139,0.4303,2.0447,0.9289,3.3768,1.8518,4.0446,2.1648,3.4557,1.6136,5.969,2.1404,3.6086,1.5963,4.2583,1.5092,2.623,2.418,4.0135,5.7143,4.479,0.8727,4.689,3.9091,0.2043,0.4333,1.4931,5.8394,0.1454,0.8655,0.621,0.359,0.5671,2.348,5.1478,0.1489,5.4345,4.7278,1.0591,2.0266,0.8915,2.8795,0.2741,1.0656,1.5778,2.0046,5.3473,1.5193,4.8264,0.0169,1.7293,3.4533,4.064,9.6756,2.1283,0.7233,1.0134,0.0003,2.6795,4.3796,3.5539,6.461,3.209,1.0637,1.508,0.3334,4.1253,6.3556,5.4987,1.1584,0.4861,3.3837,4.7155,3.8167,2.0501,6.2197,6.6917,4.1864,0.0748,2.7561,2.211,2.5033,1.5786,2.4568,3.7612,0.0606,1.9526,1.6988,0.0179,0.9668,3.9276,1.9549,0.2271,6.1008,5.0683,3.8401,1.2309,0.0003,1.9194,4.8581,3.2675,2.4543,5.7731,0.9215,3.9079,0.3994,4.965,1.3689,4.6559,1.9965,3.7549,1.3392,2.1301,4.406,4.8916,0.5507,4.714,0.5751,2.3846,5.7382,6.621,2.2707,2.3755,2.097,4.5692,0.5746,1.1715,6.7708,0.0063,4.8053,6.6575,1.9027,8.2022,0.1545,6.8971,1.0387,0.2176,1.6374,1.3177,3.7853,6.1755,2.7756,5.7651,3.1355,2.0385,3.3165,5.7097,0.2563,1.8634,5.4401,0.7621,5.1966,1.7207,3.0027,1.1111,3.6255,3.465,6.063,2.4219,1.9465,5.3968,2.9735,2.7872,2.3921,2.5306,1.0247,2.0513,0.9162,6.418,1.8383,2.337,1.2932,6.9273,1.3951,6.4382,1.3532,0.9658,1.6411,0.3744,1.5492,1.4046,1.3726,2.2483,1.2369,2.9354,3.3085,4.6639,1.3647,0.069,3.7484,5.1721,1.0821,0.6054,4.7068,1.4224,1.89,3.4297,0.7357,2.5209,5.7268,0.9023,1.5534,0.0634,0.8674,0.249,0.0135,0.0008,0.0037,0.6255,6.0609,0.2068,7.6527,5.7658,6.5213,0.5805,0.0018,0.0033,2.5121,3.6675,0.3748,0.5487,1.2509,6.1509,1.769,0.5648,4.093,0.8014,1.2335,2.2963,6.0934,0.0179,0.3674,1.8746,0.168,0.0013,1.4817,0.8723,0.0002,1.7682,0.9009,2.8354,0.3616,0.8006,2.0542,0.0023,1.2881,4.4267,0.8069,2.6265,1.3796,1.4553,2.7455,1.5406,1.4854,3.0949,0.6588,1.4379,4.675,2.2322,1.8976,0.5501,2.1189,0.1006,0.4875,0.8407,0.0015,6.7733,2.9509,2.7567,0.0929,1.383,3.8317,3.9353,0.6127,2.3988,2.8533,4.501,3.3822,5.5568,6.6948,0.0043,1.9476,5.2474,2.3433,2.2443,2.5711,0.0826,0.5134,1.1318,2.8309,0.0607,0.0473,0.0828,1.8403,3.454,6.3556,2.8633,3.5801,5.0826,4.0324,2.0181,1.3798,0.0649,0.8327,1.5011,1.8066,0.1081,0.4119,0.2135,4.3227,1.4019,0.6097,0.1409,0.003,6.5488,1.3099,1.4883,0.6145,0.8642,2.9862,0.2764,9.4836,5.204,1.0396,0.9397,0.0002,4.8556,0.7614,0.0004,6.0325,1.0076,0.0007,5.4379]}

Their main structural uses are as part of biological membranes both internal and external, such as the cell membrane, or as a source of amino acid, and as a storage medium. They can form a variety of microglial, phagocytes (the cell membranes used by the immune system) and other cell membranes.\n\nLipids are capable of functioning as a variety of biological membranes, including the cell membranes used by the immune system and the membrane system involved in inflammation and the protection of human health.\n\nThe lipids, e.g. collagen and bicoronucleic acid, are found in many organisms including humans and mice (Genes, caspase I, B9), and are used in numerous applications. The lipids are usually derived from the body\u2019s host cells (insects, plants, animals, fungi and grass) and have a natural, biologically stable and chemical nature.\n\nIt is important to note that many of the lipids may have been derived from the human or animal organs or tissues, that are also the bodies of these living things, or that were derived from the bodies of animals.\n\nFor example, lipids can contain lipoproteins (a group of proteins that contain lipids, e.g. lipids), or transmembrane lipids (a group of proteins that contain lipids), or other lipids that contain phosphodiesterases such as lipase 7 (loprotein), lipase 8 (lipase 2a, 6), or phosphorylates.\n\nThey also contain lipotracks (a group of antibodies that are synthesized in the body), and the lipotracks have a chemical, biological property.\n\nThere are also different factors associated with lipoproteins. Depending on the body\u2019s diet, including the type of diet, glycemic control, and other nutritional parameters, the rate of lipoproteins is generally measured in terms of liporeaction or lipolysis ratio.\n\nThe concentration is a measure of how often lipotracks in the body are produced, as well as the amount lipotracks are sold to the customer through the local pharmacy or any drugstore outlet.\n\nFor example, the ratio of the amount of lipotracks produced by 1 to 15 is a measure of how much lipotracks are sold to the customer through a local pharmacy or any drugstore outlet.","token_len":515,"entropy":[7.2668,5.0909,2.3659,3.3983,1.8863,6.2475,2.5242,0.1418,5.8395,2.4765,0.1327,2.2489,3.6596,5.473,5.8595,7.7056,0.8481,2.0428,5.7088,0.0321,3.3819,3.3567,9.8317,5.1992,0.2254,0.0359,1.3949,3.6081,0.0114,2.9889,3.9841,0.893,1.1246,3.7195,0.5909,1.6077,5.078,0.1072,5.1428,1.9443,3.7734,3.2884,0.8709,1.0282,5.5348,1.1949,2.1879,3.2285,2.4636,5.4882,2.6747,2.5008,0.0016,5.7609,5.7993,2.2128,2.9023,4.9609,0.7051,2.1022,3.6306,3.8608,3.7832,3.3828,4.4579,1.6195,1.3102,2.4532,0.1575,1.896,0.3403,2.7696,2.7895,2.6558,1.0168,2.3127,0.0012,4.598,0.0191,0.2149,0.8436,5.6319,0.007,6.505,0.8058,1.5484,5.3712,0.0018,2.5631,2.1843,1.1999,1.3868,2.0666,2.1532,2.2067,1.8377,0.3638,0.2153,0.2583,0.0086,2.2161,1.8678,4.6233,4.3062,4.9166,0.0481,4.6206,1.4962,3.422,7.8777,0.4462,4.9611,2.2384,0.5708,1.9892,0.0002,2.3231,3.4997,0.049,4.0252,6.6555,0.4948,0.0083,1.3482,5.5863,1.3959,4.5721,5.0742,7.536,1.554,5.572,0.286,0.1921,0.412,0.6312,3.6262,0.4915,2.0726,4.4001,2.0423,2.1742,1.4528,4.4429,4.1794,6.3327,2.6523,1.6081,7.3743,4.4816,0.2598,6.9093,0.7236,4.2995,7.1727,3.6766,1.7729,1.4827,2.6446,1.3684,4.2663,4.089,1.9606,2.5428,1.6237,0.0147,0.8528,5.2111,4.2116,0.075,2.2319,5.4198,15.5912,7.5889,5.2534,7.4939,1.9944,2.4259,4.2739,4.4961,0.0874,0.6138,2.9467,0.3452,1.7832,0.6917,1.6288,1.7521,7.9671,2.991,0.8351,3.6566,1.9303,5.1294,3.3227,5.3641,6.2728,2.4715,5.9014,4.1357,0.4573,1.113,0.0003,4.9363,0.3674,2.2332,0.1144,0.6582,0.1377,4.0444,1.7309,0.2605,0.4756,0.0067,3.9289,2.559,2.6461,1.7193,0.1289,2.035,3.8408,3.5997,1.3293,5.0621,2.3657,0.9181,1.4951,5.2363,1.7446,3.759,4.3417,5.1026,0.3916,4.5362,3.7401,3.3633,1.9902,1.9357,0.9233,3.846,2.2721,0.1217,1.4469,4.4569,0.1288,2.4748,1.1098,1.1642,0.0003,4.6746,0.7414,0.0988,1.9168,0.0348,2.3237,4.5446,4.3304,1.2139,0.057,0.0016,1.8203,3.6932,1.9236,0.0691,1.6799,1.0864,3.8981,2.7076,1.243,2.684,3.0555,0.0013,0.0005,0.1048,1.8308,2.431,4.3215,3.473,7.2937,0.9309,0.0011,0.1243,1.848,0.0792,0.6309,1.2515,0.1224,0.0309,0.8419,0.3206,0.9732,1.2406,0.1361,3.8152,0.9787,3.1066,1.5172,0.1291,2.1334,2.217,5.6479,2.1162,0.002,0.9627,4.3128,0.0028,1.8347,1.2305,7.2493,1.4754,4.6077,2.9095,6.0157,3.9713,2.0339,0.1003,1.383,0.0635,1.2552,1.4827,3.8183,5.1582,1.2585,5.6872,2.291,1.0241,3.7438,3.0344,1.2072,4.1052,2.679,0.7466,0.0002,5.2395,2.28,0.8559,2.5968,4.3484,7.3126,5.627,0.8257,1.6192,0.3656,0.0178,4.9985,0.6012,2.0963,4.4357,0.0983,2.2158,0.7172,1.1449,2.5229,2.2459,3.86,1.7405,0.6897,1.4208,0.2675,3.3779,1.296,3.3218,2.8912,1.5558,5.9598,1.6059,0.9139,0.0002,3.9277,0.2894,2.3222,4.3186,7.1872,4.2665,0.0088,0.8078,2.2687,0.2767,0.0104,1.5418,6.9591,0.0602,0.4726,4.7202,9.9833,0.0517,0.0925,5.0338,0.4813,6.3541,1.3147,2.2323,0.365,2.1164,1.2406,6.7965,0.1821,3.2085,0.6331,1.4868,2.8296,4.1611,4.1673,0.2779,1.9371,6.158,0.4649,0.6947,0.1629,0.4442,0.0663,3.0161,5.1027,6.3303,1.7453,2.7123,0.0032,2.8507,5.9676,4.0584,3.8665,1.8411,1.8821,0.0567,7.9401,0.739,0.693,0.0002,1.9781,6.191,5.8915,3.5394,1.2886,0.0512,2.4121,3.709,1.4248,2.9857,1.3301,0.5606,4.8767,0.5009,0.4666,1.1142,2.0457,1.8546,2.9683,1.0501,0.0054,0.9017,1.5952,6.7138,0.8894,0.2853,0.4221,1.0304,6.9263,2.7191,1.1397,4.5609,6.0518,1.0056,5.727,3.6951,1.8991,6.068,4.8044,1.123,4.2944,0.2997,0.6824,0.0002,3.8746,0.7726,0.0286,2.1543,4.8016,0.1765,2.5992,2.2316,0.0954,0.4644,0.4485,0.0872,0.0367,2.8498,1.6229,5.8114,2.9369,4.3311,1.7978,4.2433,1.3407,0.0515,1.0332,1.8824,0.8089,0.3603,0.1116,0.1617,0.636,1.6699,1.1902,0.623,0.9544,1.9221,2.8221,2.4676,0.2315,0.8601,0.5481,0.0258,0.002,0.0498,0.2802]}

{"id":1905,"ended":true,"length":476,"text":"In 1839, Charles Goodyear discovered a way of processing natural rubber, which is too stiff when cold and too soft when warm, in such a way as to make it elastic.\n\nThe first known rubber was made of natural rubber in a laboratory in 1841, before the invention of the sewing machine, while a second prototype was made in 1843, the same year as Goodyear\u2019s discovery of the technology.\n\nBy the time Goodyear and his colleagues got to the prototype they knew that they had solved the problem of elasticity.\n\nThe problem was that if the elasticity of natural rubber was sufficiently low, then the rubber would be stiff.\n\nSo the team at the University of London made a new rubber, which has a slightly lower strength than the polymer to form the rubber.\n\nSince then, other rubber teams have solved this problem, using the same processes.\n\nThe first pair of prototypes made by Goodyear and his colleagues is made by making rubber balls in small blocks, which use a natural rubber, similar to the rubber balls used today.\n\nTo make rubber balls with a natural rubber, scientists have to use other materials, which, like wood, have high tensile and dimensional strengths, but which have little elastic support.\n\nThis gives the result that, for example, a rubber ball having more than 300 tens of tens of tens of tens of tens of tens of tens of tens of tens of tens of tens of tens of tens of elastic properties will still be stiff, unlike the rubber balls made by Goodyear.\n\nFor example, according to the paper, the rubber balls described in the article were formed using the same process used in the production of rubber balls.\n\nThe rubber balls described in the article, however, are also made of wood, and it is this hard metal which has some elastic support, and which makes up a very large part of the rubber balls described.\n\nThe method used in the paper also gives the balls made by the team at the university a higher strength than the rubber balls made by the other teams, and is likely to be much lower in strength than rubber balls made by the other teams.\n\nIn addition, they have made many attempts to test the test materials, for example by combining them in a single device and testing them in different conditions.\n\nThe paper\u2019s conclusion is that with each device we find that the performance of rubber balls made by the other rubber teams is better than the rubber balls made by both

The following year his name was given to the role in a performance of the role in The Wizard of Oz starring Eddie Murphy and John Williams.\n\nAfter he was nominated four times for Best Picture at the Venice Film Festival in 1941, the United States Senate rejected his nomination in February 1942. A federal appeals court in July 1942 ordered the Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to stop granting him a visa out of fear that his long-term residence would be revoked.\n\nStromper was deported to America in February 1943, but returned to the United States on November 28, 1941, after a successful trial by deportation to the U.S. Army Camp Pendleton. He worked as a translator and made a career out of acting while in the Army.\n\nHe made many friends with the American composer, John Revere, as well as the musicians who performed on his songs like \"The Sweet Talk\" and \"The Wrecking Crew.\" He had also recorded a number of songs for the songwriting duo The Stuttgart Boys, who arranged the tunes as music for Revere's song. The trio produced many songs on The Stuttgart Boys' music.\n\nStromper is survived by his wife, Dorothy; two daughters, Deborah, and Carol, and four grandchildren.\n\nSources:\n\nFoster, Linda, \"A Walk in the Land of the Greengrass and the Sea.\" In The New York Times on May 1, 1943.","token_len":515,"entropy":[11.5998,0.2771,12.4637,1.0667,1.9921,6.9223,0.7532,8.1518,6.7118,3.2315,2.6557,0.9532,7.3244,7.3047,2.2516,9.787,4.0681,0.8717,5.2657,0.6544,1.6014,6.1487,14.7808,7.6759,6.3021,4.2833,4.799,8.5655,4.55,4.6548,6.2929,0.8943,1.2807,3.2312,13.3251,2.4656,1.5132,6.8343,1.6127,1.5902,6.039,1.222,3.8686,0.6821,1.5082,2.9703,1.4749,0.0024,2.8,12.9142,2.4987,2.8073,0.757,6.1476,1.7267,2.5048,4.5757,5.4373,7.3687,0.0659,1.5573,3.9192,5.5789,1.3372,0.8489,2.0171,0.8068,4.3339,3.819,3.2009,3.5951,0.2369,2.922,1.0945,0.9979,5.081,1.8707,3.7907,0.6693,1.5109,0.0004,2.8369,7.4596,0.1057,3.6465,3.4825,0.8923,1.7998,5.279,2.4623,7.3334,4.2163,1.6315,3.3429,5.8913,0.7877,0.3596,1.2119,1.5617,3.5387,0.4341,3.987,0.9585,3.3711,2.8686,1.7096,4.3759,0.56,5.9388,5.6739,0.0002,1.7624,1.5713,0.0003,4.6944,4.0868,0.1643,0.595,1.2057,6.542,6.2421,4.8049,1.508,4.3943,3.7838,14.3613,7.7321,4.8858,6.3626,5.5404,1.8001,7.2162,7.595,0.1954,3.5032,1.8549,0.0339,11.5609,0.3245,4.614,4.6335,0.9244,3.5297,1.7928,7.6012,5.1245,0.7889,0.0003,3.6034,5.3508,0.1852,0.0005,4.5991,1.771,5.4403,1.3631,0.9739,3.086,5.9961,2.8464,0.8873,3.3279,0.1865,5.2797,1.333,0.1864,4.5859,1.8177,7.2194,3.1702,0.2842,1.7105,1.6382,5.4507,1.7418,6.5262,0.381,6.1947,6.9462,0.0001,1.6069,3.4483,4.529,7.08,1.7767,1.8211,5.5519,0.129,4.5355,1.3701,0.9071,7.4462,1.2607,0.3754,3.3058,3.7988,0.3669,0.4483,0.0003,3.2189,5.7583,0.0067,0.0294,0.0286,2.409,0.0034,2.7103,1.4795,4.6156,1.3116,2.347,2.5958,4.9129,5.9801,0.006,1.1764,4.2759,1.3909,2.8078,4.0797,0.04,5.7288,3.2358,0.2722,4.325,0.2458,1.7719,5.3827,2.6262,2.465,6.5826,1.6903,1.9642,4.8828,1.131,2.6978,4.803,0.0984,0.0079,5.9105,5.4796,0.9563,2.1153,3.7532,4.957,0.5842,0.4636,0.0003,3.6513,3.3443,1.3435,2.6899,7.1856,0.0719,0.6639,1.1542,1.4331,1.3309,0.1627,5.9429,0.1118,0.0401,1.1126,2.9953,0.4261,2.3847,3.8145,0.0192,4.3065,2.8459,0.4731,0.5039,1.1234,3.5823,1.0322,0.9761,4.3621,4.2058,1.1951,0.0124,2.9622,5.8737,0.9227,3.0848,1.6423,4.8049,0.075,6.3254,0.3887,2.2898,0.0452,0.1993,3.2528,4.9878,2.2003,2.287,0.9409,7.9698,0.0128,2.0966,1.0277,1.6428,6.2355,1.1498,1.7407,5.0119,1.9701,1.219,3.3211,0.7402,0.3074,0.0003,1.5284,0.0986,0.0004,1.5452,4.8497,0.7157,5.173,0.6669,3.9864,1.2567,1.094,2.4161,2.7298,0.4631,2.4649,0.6637,0.0138,1.555,4.1346,3.7825,0.0491,4.0784,0.7469,2.6357,2.2126,4.778,3.1404,3.4802,7.4413,3.3036,2.2055,3.0601,0.0018,0.0439,0.0659,3.5641,4.8284,2.0491,0.001,0.9896,1.5546,4.6861,1.3547,0.3265,4.6871,1.8438,6.3308,2.2472,3.7359,0.9994,0.0045,4.8646,5.8599,1.8942,0.8438,1.5026,0.6374,0.5257,0.0002,1.9855,4.0857,5.3313,3.5815,3.7477,1.6649,2.7618,6.5579,2.6119,3.8699,7.0247,6.1698,0.5101,3.9558,0.2143,0.0049,2.3815,5.6956,3.1466,3.4028,2.4751,1.4006,3.3076,5.6098,2.2397,2.2618,6.5754,8.1009,1.5405,0.2281,0.2069,2.1384,5.7896,2.5367,1.359,1.9415,0.4073,2.0698,3.4413,1.9493,5.4636,2.0306,1.2354,0.0189,2.2797,1.1381,1.4091,4.4916,3.6735,2.8011,2.5423,5.067,4.8869,0.0525,3.3221,1.441,2.7221,6.8726,1.4075,8.2038,4.9298,6.7297,0.7689,6.2991,0.021,0.2151,3.7335,3.1699,3.9564,3.5891,4.5129,2.8717,2.7401,3.8973,2.7799,2.238,0.0362,0.0032,0.3028,0.322,3.7071,2.1026,0.3104,0.0002,1.166,0.014,0.0005,4.6826,0.5694,0.0019,0.2186,0.2314,0.7137,4.0804,2.6056,1.549,1.5203,0.2545,6.6093,1.2859,4.136,5.6056,1.656,0.5386,2.819,0.2756,0.526,0.8288,0.0003,4.1064,0.4661,1.0595,0.0004,5.2446,4.2474,0.8934,5.3597,1.8757,1.3518,3.8755,5.9547,0.976,0.1316,7.9607,0.1562,0.4308,6.7412,7.1496,4.7488,0.7223,5.2558,4.5504,3.8531,1.4772,3.4746,0.6533,0.0819,3.8222,2.6043,3.4774,0.0148,3.5144,1.0158]}

{"id":1927,"ended":true,"length":419,"text":"The discovery of Iguanodon has long been accompanied by a popular legend.

But now, years after her husband's death, the Iguanodon's official museum has been closed for repairs and reconstruction, and she is still missing.\n\nThis is one of the most valuable and popular scientific and archaeological discoveries ever made by any ancient Indian tribe in the Americas.\n\nOur team carried out extensive investigations with the support of the Indian tribe of Arachnid, who discovered the Iguanodon in its first instance in 1637 and are now involved in an ongoing restoration project.","token_len":515,"entropy":[9.503,0.7797,7.7643,5.0015,2.7907,1.4236,4.9034,4.8867,0.5581,7.1332,0.0691,1.8505,7.1556,5.5032,2.2067,1.9088,3.6658,1.8595,0.1762,10.6374,10.9983,2.2477,3.9982,2.8221,1.1418,3.3468,3.3881,1.3886,3.6502,1.2471,5.3121,6.9126,0.8126,2.9571,1.1435,0.001,0.0016,0.0002,1.5582,1.9945,10.617,0.4732,0.3358,1.4297,6.1358,2.7092,0.0135,3.1765,6.2362,1.4622,6.2666,0.6844,0.9298,0.8466,1.8671,0.3242,4.9738,0.0461,0.007,0.0179,2.5187,5.1293,2.0267,0.0041,0.0611,1.3833,1.1143,5.0962,0.2029,0.0332,0.1685,2.841,0.8698,5.2905,4.0781,3.2398,1.6991,1.94,3.4983,5.386,4.5659,1.9777,1.4128,3.7816,1.9623,5.1295,4.7824,1.5249,5.9839,0.886,4.8007,3.7921,0.4407,0.2852,0.1182,1.9826,2.1298,0.0003,0.0031,0.0012,3.3577,6.6197,6.2061,1.6548,2.0442,3.5767,2.5267,4.7,2.0809,4.2125,2.2192,1.2026,4.569,1.2264,2.7062,2.6261,0.4433,0.9034,0.0032,3.777,2.0529,3.4832,0.2055,0.6501,1.4755,6.7645,3.2346,4.9666,4.6615,3.355,0.8537,1.1131,2.5939,0.362,2.5543,3.4671,4.143,4.9468,1.4425,1.7015,0.7332,3.255,0.2498,2.174,0.0002,6.2077,3.9921,6.456,0.0392,3.4142,4.4943,3.9909,1.2858,4.7567,0.0211,1.198,4.1097,5.1562,0.4723,5.721,5.9439,1.7144,1.8162,1.9787,1.8546,3.8936,1.325,1.7993,0.0004,0.0031,0.001,1.9092,4.6157,4.3847,5.7794,1.5209,4.1688,4.5245,3.3137,5.3546,1.8313,5.8894,0.3282,3.4206,0.7387,5.0596,1.1189,0.7535,0.7857,0.0002,5.7025,1.2489,1.7151,5.1038,5.9654,2.3083,1.6098,3.6622,1.6888,0.0263,0.6756,0.2202,0.0001,2.2362,2.9303,1.9723,0.0014,0.0033,0.0009,1.7046,1.3634,0.8329,1.2452,5.2295,0.2242,4.9696,1.2109,0.9098,2.5273,3.3153,0.909,4.4703,0.0079,0.0998,0.4605,4.7331,0.6862,6.8651,2.1703,2.2096,0.0001,3.3318,3.4001,0.0032,0.0055,0.0003,1.492,3.1982,0.0283,0.4693,2.8729,1.1901,0.7682,3.7908,1.8842,3.2306,1.2114,0.0697,0.2595,4.8437,1.558,3.0008,0.8772,4.2736,5.2034,0.0087,6.559,4.6427,2.0304,3.4328,1.1264,1.6467,2.3259,3.7701,2.77,0.0016,2.6365,6.491,5.2322,2.4754,0.0005,0.0032,0.0001,1.492,0.8716,0.391,0.4265,0.0001,3.0829,5.4261,1.7644,4.1298,0.0101,0.3787,3.5797,3.1204,1.6706,2.7693,1.7345,0.8164,1.182,0.8297,0.7102,1.2104,0.7557,0.0006,0.0042,0.0003,2.9575,0.9837,1.7323,2.0458,1.2536,1.2379,0.003,0.0132,0.1695,0.2125,0.0002,0.0065,8.0412,0.0197,10.5899,5.9636,9.7879,3.1755,0.0541,0.1627,0.0331,1.5016,8.8434,0.8335,0.8947,0.0002,1.2831,2.9058,0.5962,1.3639,1.1535,0.0003,0.001,0.0001,1.8806,2.1852,0.0076,0.0033,0.0113,0.0206,0.0014,0.0109,0.027,0.1797,0.0397,0.0041,0.0027,0.1844,0.0022,0.0013,0.0011,0.0004,0.0021,0.005,0.0017,0.0017,13.0783,0.0214,0.066,0.0009,0.0013,0.0296,0.012,0.0004,0.0003,0.0,0.0073,0.0013,0.0009,0.0022,0.0009,0.0021,0.0069,0.0007,0.0005,0.0093,0.0019,0.002,0.0071,0.0048,0.0068,0.0015,0.0049,0.0029,0.4156,0.0006,0.0008,0.0001,0.0041,0.0053,0.0157,0.0011,0.0034,0.0079,0.002,0.0023,0.0002,0.0004,0.0001,0.0037,0.0068,0.0027,0.0007,11.5362,0.003,0.001,0.0096,0.0127,0.0007,0.0036,0.0007,0.0028,0.0041,0.023,0.0039,0.0005,0.0128,0.006,0.007,0.0007,0.0007,0.0006,0.0007,0.0015,0.0007,0.0002,0.0006,0.0001,0.0005,0.003,0.0056,0.001,0.0016,0.0035,0.0034,0.0344,0.001,0.0092,0.0169,0.0011,0.0206,0.0051,0.0013,0.0001,0.0006,0.2857,0.0001,1.7763,1.1838,0.0572,0.0006,0.0035,0.0071,0.0644,0.0012,0.0025,0.0077,0.0004,0.0021,0.0018,0.0037,0.0114,0.0044,0.0032,0.0039,0.0022,0.0032,0.0039,0.0011,0.0002,0.0046,0.1057,0.0001,2.5214,0.1323,0.0229,0.0008,0.02,0.0697,0.0031,0.0013,0.0033,0.0009,0.0018,0.0026,0.0028,0.0005,0.0037,0.0011,0.0014,0.0009,0.0175,0.0044,0.0059,0.0036,0.0082,0.0004,0.0006,0.0001,0.0027,0.0033,0.001,0.0004,0.0046,0.0018,0.1312,0.0091,0.0029,0.0011,0.0004,0.0034,0.0021,0.0001,0.0012,0.0143,0.0028]}

One had sex with her, but only had oral sex with it. Borchard wrote a short story as to why people would be willing to die for her and its protagonist \u2014 known as the \u201cGay\u201d character \u2013.\n\nAccording to Blumhouse, the characters in Borchard\u2019s series are not only gay but also lesbian and bi. \u201cIn the story I write there is no romance or non-violent sex. She is a girl and she is a lesbian,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe Gay\u201d\n\nWolstencroft wrote the first major scene in Borchard\u2019s series. She takes the role of an unmarried lesbian. She is at first shown to be at a party that is very similar to a sexual one \u2014 and after a few weeks it is almost immediately obvious when she takes on the role of the lesbian. But after a few seconds she realises that the person she is going along with is her lover. The lesbian is in fact a gay man who is trying to escape his childhood in order to survive.\n\n\u201cIt is easy to see how many writers write about lesbians. Their careers aren\u2019t really as well off as straight writers. I like the idea that there is a female queer character who is fighting for the rights of her lesbian lover. She gets pregnant just before she wants to start a child, is married and has child support.\u201d\n\nSo it makes sense that Borchard would love to die at the end of the show, she said. \u201cShe was a great actress, her character was very likable, very smart, very passionate and had an interesting personality. She had an interesting personality at the start, and a very well known and well lived personality at the end of the series.\u201d","token_len":517,"entropy":[7.3961,3.6667,8.8923,5.1207,0.1024,7.7114,5.2013,9.4941,5.4549,4.6898,1.9524,5.0545,0.1839,4.1504,1.6812,3.4672,2.4442,2.4549,0.3505,6.2407,1.0443,3.8281,0.5355,6.9136,2.7845,5.1055,0.8938,6.5025,0.0029,7.2203,7.2611,7.7393,0.0992,0.2684,1.7139,6.0089,3.6344,4.2733,2.7692,3.197,4.1497,4.2639,6.775,4.5603,2.4154,1.6648,5.4817,2.0532,4.4835,1.1807,1.0225,15.0254,6.2995,6.5957,1.9932,2.6263,8.2195,9.3058,3.0967,4.8827,2.2718,0.434,0.5465,0.0003,6.0182,5.5216,5.7958,2.2989,0.7675,2.2983,4.5676,3.2787,0.0668,0.6916,2.8989,5.5686,0.044,0.3794,3.1698,4.0299,4.0442,1.588,4.9437,1.9402,1.3773,5.1004,3.3952,5.7087,5.3116,0.0102,0.0,3.8817,0.0026,1.7492,4.2892,0.0028,1.126,1.6952,4.221,1.0617,1.3828,2.2632,2.2706,3.1613,2.9786,0.8317,0.0012,4.1142,4.162,0.6104,1.518,1.6953,0.9979,3.9865,2.1803,2.5987,2.7579,2.7,0.3392,1.9622,5.0138,2.0587,6.0916,0.002,7.1797,1.2562,1.4785,0.9152,0.4171,0.0002,4.6073,5.8588,0.9789,0.3775,1.8206,0.0011,3.9575,1.6978,6.2448,1.5377,2.1154,1.8401,6.6721,5.7795,3.4229,4.7423,6.9872,5.3831,0.3229,1.5631,1.7933,2.1241,4.7607,4.5848,4.8676,0.022,1.5717,3.9451,0.5584,2.6613,0.0018,3.1802,2.5067,3.4447,0.6949,5.914,3.8598,1.3279,4.9286,2.454,3.0137,4.4618,0.0123,3.4821,0.7025,1.6507,4.2555,5.0332,4.7461,6.2799,6.863,0.6414,2.3499,7.5995,0.9481,7.9458,1.5416,3.9506,3.7488,2.8457,7.1286,0.779,0.0002,4.4459,0.0027,2.6516,0.0016,0.0017,0.097,1.4958,4.7034,1.6817,4.6719,0.0051,6.8063,7.02,1.4233,3.4631,1.0452,2.5392,3.3518,2.4725,1.5735,0.4836,2.6438,1.9579,3.9624,0.9715,8.3572,0.2081,3.9288,1.6026,4.0084,7.2178,3.5947,5.4761,0.8805,2.5097,6.2354,2.5259,5.5496,0.1598,5.8083,3.1486,1.7331,6.2876,0.8824,1.5078,4.0846,2.4962,1.6047,1.0609,1.6065,1.234,1.8321,6.5961,2.9309,2.1271,1.2779,0.1354,0.4673,0.0002,2.7527,0.3818,2.0358,5.5156,0.3592,0.0716,7.9605,0.0002,6.8922,0.2681,0.0069,0.0066,0.0046,0.0006,3.0261,1.1934,4.8515,5.7053,2.5017,1.1325,3.6152,0.0031,1.4102,0.0947,0.0102,0.5513,1.4756,2.6129,7.1805,1.3797,1.756,0.0855,3.2583,6.0712,1.7609,3.1964,1.7179,1.4554,5.3265,2.0624,4.9935,1.9042,0.3405,5.5889,1.8335,2.853,4.826,1.9004,4.4672,3.9998,0.0301,2.02,4.5654,3.7021,4.3873,3.0378,5.6165,1.9021,1.4905,4.7748,4.2075,1.4368,5.2573,3.8167,3.6795,5.2964,0.5757,5.4029,2.232,0.4161,0.2343,2.145,0.9671,2.8574,0.9171,4.5865,2.827,1.1711,0.6395,3.9795,1.4819,8.1902,0.0055,0.7218,2.3875,4.417,0.759,0.5043,4.2247,7.9915,0.0754,0.3699,3.769,3.2139,0.8746,2.5419,3.1691,1.6115,4.0555,2.4235,1.2856,3.7525,0.8363,2.2432,1.224,4.0821,0.0574,3.8338,1.8768,5.819,3.0846,2.7356,0.024,4.2874,1.0402,0.7712,0.0002,1.4531,0.0814,4.9127,0.7909,5.5484,0.282,1.2969,1.5441,4.8871,7.2722,5.534,1.5739,3.7025,2.7253,4.8044,6.5843,5.5502,6.2988,7.8349,0.2089,3.8104,3.4551,4.3177,3.9202,0.19,7.1063,2.5546,1.7331,4.056,5.1555,2.1801,1.5487,1.2495,2.5788,0.7817,1.0127,5.2228,7.676,1.1119,1.3037,0.9763,4.8777,0.8306,2.6676,1.9447,0.0947,1.6351,2.0945,1.4076,0.8319,4.0166,5.1249,5.6814,6.3518,2.2201,1.5207,5.6481,0.3164,3.9696,1.5525,5.1026,1.5568,4.8513,4.3511,1.7592,0.8926,5.2996,3.5799,1.6344,5.7548,3.3862,1.3277,0.0002,5.48,2.7922,3.5905,0.3147,0.3008,2.8438,0.0039,2.0289,4.2069,0.2172,5.3876,5.33,0.7659,1.1577,0.1086,0.707,2.0588,1.5501,3.6015,0.2876,0.1253,3.1002,0.1084,2.4558,3.507,2.4688,3.2237,2.6947,1.5302,5.2786,1.5848,0.7073,2.768,3.7412,0.0036,1.1631,4.9287,3.3965,0.8695,1.9091,4.7873,1.4316,3.9416,2.587,2.7075,2.3084,0.5068,1.6928,2.7444,2.4454,1.4904,2.919,5.705,0.9164,3.0491,1.6881,1.7289,4.3428,1.4322,4.2757,3.7437,2.8546,1.2125,7.0909,3.543,2.8392,0.0522,0.0433,1.8378,0.22,1.7184,0.2731,3.5457,1.3029]}
{"id":4483,"ended":true,"length":456,"text":"The Delichon martins were originally cliff nesters, breeding in colonies situated under an overhang on a vertical cliff. However, the house martin now largely uses human structures, as, to a distance of 60 meters, the wooded areas are very flat, so they can fit up to the mountain, but it will take much extra time to build their bases, hence, the need for an army of the mordin to defend these new colonies. These are the home martins of the Delichon, they are one of the best mountain wooded colonies.\n\nThe Delichon mordin and the new colony was created with one simple concept, and only two years old!\n\nOur mission is to provide quality home martins, as the martins and the mordin have grown to form one of the largest mountain wooded colonies in the world, with a population of less than 80,000. The result is that they are more than happy to enjoy living in the woods, and that is why we have built over a 100 meters of mountain wooded colonies in the mountains of South America and the United States, with a population of less than 10,000.\n\nThe first home martins were found in Peru and Bolivia in the 1650s. There is a much better record of the first home martins, since in many colonies they have grown up in an overhang on a vertical cliffs. Our home martins were discovered in the 1650s : they have been growing out of the mordin\u2019s territory, but also under the shadow of hills, as it is only one km away from the mountain. We are looking into a new way of growing the home martins, in order to start by recruiting the martin and the mordin members to join our project \u201cMordin Forest\u201d, so that when the land that the martin is growing on would become unoccupied, they would return home, after which the new colony would become free from the mordin.\n\nWe will help to plant the first few replanted native tree in any colony, and so, we can build a successful colony in the next few years, as they have already grown to an impressive size.\n\nWe are happy to participate in any project which would help the new colony become free and to welcome us home, just like we had made it for our old colony. Please do not hesitate to contact me, if you have a suggestion, please give me an email, or message me.","token_len":517,"entropy":[9.666,7.8518,5.4086,11.9569,3.5415,2.6701,4.8468,15.0722,7.4859,1.1911,1.343,9.1686,2.2947,7.122,7.6375,5.0833,4.7462,3.5136,1.8608,3.2352,2.2941,6.9942,1.9438,0.9752,4.4666,0.1037,2.0731,8.8026,7.1276,1.577,5.5992,8.6564,5.3355,6.5887,6.754,2.01,3.4739,8.0239,4.5094,2.9697,8.0888,1.8414,4.9253,1.3848,0.5056,1.7445,7.1074,3.5205,2.7389,1.4586,4.3792,4.4937,1.7153,3.985,2.0279,2.1413,5.9127,4.3904,0.291,3.3696,6.7316,3.2617,3.0994,3.682,4.4198,1.7653,3.9475,6.6976,2.4435,0.6285,2.0998,4.5148,6.1518,2.3146,6.0847,2.4902,1.3661,3.8655,0.4593,3.5283,5.7252,0.9574,3.9362,6.207,6.4999,4.4205,4.1997,3.0368,3.9356,4.8863,2.9004,0.3121,4.7251,3.0574,2.0632,6.1015,4.886,0.2084,1.2627,0.7839,2.9265,0.0549,0.0376,3.3618,4.1075,1.1329,5.1649,0.0679,0.2138,3.4977,6.1223,8.0759,1.2901,3.3621,2.6116,1.0801,0.0928,1.5574,2.014,0.0058,0.0038,5.2203,0.0665,0.3928,4.9166,1.507,6.2276,3.5728,5.8613,3.0691,3.5536,5.562,3.8022,4.3493,2.1281,3.1318,5.5472,3.1624,4.155,4.6562,4.0644,1.3403,0.0002,5.367,4.521,1.0954,0.2582,2.2638,4.7532,5.3191,1.3293,0.2307,2.0296,3.6824,2.9828,6.5686,0.2041,4.9903,1.4308,2.8979,0.0265,1.3134,2.8948,4.6723,2.3882,6.3067,2.0283,2.2996,0.1065,3.2469,2.4028,0.5939,0.1199,0.7645,0.5492,0.63,0.2786,1.8058,2.5934,1.978,2.7919,0.1966,5.0067,0.009,4.7078,0.6934,0.0137,0.9525,2.2101,6.1241,0.544,1.9109,3.9874,0.8506,4.4103,1.4232,3.2449,0.251,5.8821,4.0354,0.9987,1.2802,4.4098,0.969,1.4021,3.9519,2.1324,0.9599,0.6976,1.8677,2.8578,4.8722,3.3569,3.5517,5.2159,1.2124,3.8195,0.8682,1.4093,3.7271,2.2942,1.2953,2.9138,0.7977,4.8127,1.0592,1.922,1.9403,3.4612,0.246,1.5958,2.4252,2.3216,2.0063,0.1727,2.4847,0.0066,3.0711,0.0658,0.0098,0.6138,0.765,0.0002,1.9459,4.2892,2.4517,0.05,1.0034,1.1843,4.3802,0.6658,3.8474,2.654,1.9354,1.4292,1.9243,5.0443,3.2694,0.7054,1.1174,4.4628,2.6556,1.4887,5.7738,2.6167,3.3819,0.3786,1.1737,3.8313,0.4403,0.0129,0.3443,2.2296,4.7732,4.0927,3.9793,6.5362,2.5598,1.9193,2.4332,2.7194,1.6769,4.2465,1.3118,0.0644,2.012,0.7113,1.5438,5.3888,1.041,4.8346,3.2899,0.0356,0.2202,2.6868,3.8601,1.0884,1.7155,3.9219,1.1001,0.0421,10.8198,3.6778,2.669,1.5438,4.0529,4.3687,0.2493,1.6958,5.3423,0.467,0.4598,14.7972,6.8278,4.4691,6.5237,1.2566,3.2975,3.7016,3.8291,1.1273,7.2295,0.0388,5.7758,1.4743,3.7801,3.0592,0.7789,4.8402,4.647,8.0007,2.4599,0.431,0.4449,1.4008,0.6124,3.1188,2.5227,3.9632,3.5388,3.5821,1.8073,2.2061,0.9786,2.3855,2.1336,2.6338,0.0045,0.0652,0.8243,3.6641,1.2732,0.0356,6.3471,5.376,8.2439,2.2076,7.3836,1.9055,3.3248,1.2478,0.3591,0.0066,0.0032,5.0083,1.7272,2.9814,1.316,4.0501,7.8505,5.1534,8.2298,0.5073,0.239,6.2738,1.5248,7.1339,2.6927,3.4476,0.4089,4.834,1.3238,5.9027,6.1786,2.3003,2.1921,1.4774,1.9186,2.9675,1.9335,6.965,1.8317,5.9145,1.7376,0.6003,1.7279,2.5617,4.8644,2.073,2.6217,5.195,2.2838,1.6884,3.3914,1.1054,0.7229,2.3516,4.5401,2.6999,1.0617,2.5972,0.0086,0.0317,1.457,0.5551,0.0002,2.2504,3.2091,5.385,1.8616,6.0953,1.2618,2.6878,5.5735,7.2135,3.832,5.7232,3.2328,2.3381,5.906,3.5994,0.9193,1.4425,5.2331,3.2066,2.2286,2.7142,3.2941,1.7824,6.2911,1.3282,2.2417,1.4195,3.3012,0.8629,0.1635,1.4222,2.7249,3.4451,2.8542,2.3252,1.5555,1.9326,3.7732,2.0051,1.2348,0.9148,0.9509,0.0002,2.0519,1.6845,4.2852,0.1571,6.519,0.1205,3.3272,1.6971,4.19,4.3121,1.6822,2.7928,4.2118,1.0794,3.9723,2.6622,3.3562,2.7425,6.4269,4.5841,4.8433,1.5438,4.9222,1.0154,1.5692,4.3922,5.8361,2.0421,3.3915,2.5621,4.7444,0.808,0.6269,4.1964,3.8191,0.6083,0.3102,0.0558,1.2239,4.5097,2.0802,1.9268,0.0834,0.9357,3.9176,3.2129,1.3009,2.2043,4.3005,1.4264,2.5841,0.7021,1.4254,2.2753,4.6518,0.0816,2.6424]}
{"id":3377,"ended":true,"length":482,"text":"Illmatic has also received notable attention from scholars and authors outside the music industry. Since its release, the album has become the subject of scholarship within academic and literary circles. In 2009, the album became the subject of a book tour, titled Music for Young Men. The book, written by John S. Lister, has been described by scholars as \u201can epic study of the power of music for people of all ages. It has been widely published and translated into English and French\u201d.\n\nIn addition, there are reports that this album will be released into different countries, if the US President wants them.\n\nMeanwhile, In 2009, the album is distributed only through various venues. One of these venues is the Carnegie Hall in New York City and the other is the Lincoln Center in NYC. The Chicago Public Library has one in New York and the LA Public Library has the other in Los Angeles. Both of these libraries have a collection of music that people can obtain separately.\n\nIn 2011, in addition to both locations, there are reports that the album has also been released into the US via different platforms. The album has become the subject of a book tour series called \u201cBoom, Boom\u201d. Both concerts are the second in a series called \u201cOnward\u201d. The first concert went for a sold out crowd which included US musicians Jimi Hendrix, Jerry Garcia and David Lee Roth. On the other hand, the second concert went for a sold out crowd who included US politicians who included President Obama and President George W. Bush.\n\nOnward continues the ongoing efforts by the world\u2019s most prominent music artist to support the promotion of artists from all over the world. According to Variety the album is expected to have a following of $12.3 million in sales over the first year.\n\nAlso, it has reached the milestone of being the third best sold-out musical record of all-time. This achievement is made even less remarkable of course with the popularity of Inward.\n\nInward is the first album in which the world is still enjoying the popularity of its own music artist and music producer in the same generation which has dominated the world of music music at the moment. Now we can only hope that the albums will be released into the world in an international manner and not as a single single. If so, then it would be a brilliant piece of publicity at the level that music and the entire world has become an integral part of the mainstream culture and its life and its place in its history.","token_len":518,"entropy":[9.915,6.7718,3.8259,4.6801,7.4872,1.7566,1.8123,5.7774,1.607,6.0253,6.8799,1.1679,6.527,0.922,0.8623,5.1115,1.0806,2.1057,1.0185,1.1672,2.8927,0.1883,2.7254,2.2877,2.7582,0.003,8.759,5.0169,6.4199,2.2692,4.0502,0.1318,1.0896,2.2896,3.6998,0.1379,1.7853,3.1631,3.2938,1.088,1.0684,0.0039,0.8302,2.8184,4.9067,1.8684,4.4072,4.7164,2.9487,4.4221,5.142,1.4531,2.1538,1.6051,1.5868,3.1073,0.1503,4.575,4.6455,1.2027,5.1774,4.1808,0.614,3.7529,1.1257,3.9854,1.4283,3.7241,0.3736,13.351,6.4006,2.691,4.7336,4.6885,0.322,1.2221,5.1588,0.3325,1.6645,3.3941,7.8425,1.3361,0.5604,0.2286,1.8003,3.0162,2.7847,1.2652,3.6395,3.1791,1.9721,3.7773,0.7072,2.8935,1.4372,2.0758,9.9773,6.3828,2.181,1.4121,0.0008,2.2986,2.5352,1.6165,4.1541,1.5191,4.1928,0.9928,5.2684,0.6845,2.4055,0.9081,1.7274,6.8532,5.2653,2.6988,1.9668,5.9675,2.3058,5.4298,6.8689,5.0916,4.8569,0.7423,1.5723,0.0003,6.8926,0.0666,5.5659,7.7074,0.2231,0.7621,1.594,4.5897,6.4671,6.7501,3.0098,5.2217,4.8455,1.7609,5.5435,1.1672,1.56,0.5012,0.6648,1.6951,7.062,0.4991,1.0269,0.5863,0.0054,1.012,3.6301,1.4084,1.5838,0.5248,0.774,5.9275,0.3463,0.3716,8.0258,0.1935,1.9354,5.2886,3.8575,0.3392,1.5582,6.5544,4.8434,2.5061,0.0622,2.7401,1.6693,6.9193,1.0687,0.0273,0.3337,2.6597,1.0494,0.741,0.8353,0.0004,0.1556,4.0324,2.3832,0.1736,2.9277,0.9954,2.2783,3.6119,0.1235,2.9029,2.4722,6.1426,0.9095,6.3983,6.9714,1.1049,0.8575,0.0002,1.8262,3.1872,0.0954,3.0662,2.8456,0.0678,6.4285,4.3938,0.1896,3.192,1.065,2.742,0.3428,1.4656,0.6669,3.0085,1.6168,0.2619,2.2455,1.6652,2.1469,1.5937,3.4532,3.8234,3.5588,0.5038,2.3065,2.9112,1.5926,5.3154,1.4238,0.0717,0.0027,1.1207,0.2331,0.002,7.3287,2.6396,4.6807,0.1236,5.8393,5.2745,3.3106,4.8321,1.022,2.4956,1.3452,5.2849,5.0111,1.4651,5.537,3.7964,3.3063,0.7479,0.3186,3.3932,2.058,0.1544,6.1564,5.6625,3.0693,0.6892,0.8578,1.4933,2.0031,2.4899,5.3783,4.3691,2.9543,4.2388,0.6736,1.8643,6.4199,2.3485,6.5174,4.3612,7.0809,0.78,0.0172,0.0001,0.6329,6.5084,0.3694,1.745,5.0305,3.4129,0.0211,0.5056,4.4799,0.6174,2.8886,1.0378,0.066,0.7739,1.0575,0.3827,1.0835,0.1344,0.358,0.4757,0.0251,0.2327,4.9128,0.477,2.2345,6.795,4.5784,4.0659,4.108,0.6251,1.7049,4.1224,1.8466,0.082,0.0909,0.0009,0.2065,0.8016,0.0002,3.5008,8.0929,5.4695,2.4877,4.3085,4.2855,1.8871,1.7243,6.0631,8.3465,6.645,4.7218,2.6791,3.1081,1.4649,5.1288,0.9841,4.6611,1.6021,6.0504,0.1394,5.005,4.0624,1.8466,0.8625,0.0257,0.1034,0.6661,4.718,0.0027,7.7194,6.273,1.0543,1.447,3.6862,0.0247,3.8009,1.3512,7.2869,0.2044,5.6986,4.352,1.2811,2.4172,0.2128,1.5558,1.5766,3.9127,0.4506,2.4388,2.3638,0.853,1.1072,0.0003,5.5576,1.8057,3.6529,1.6062,4.7293,1.6643,4.4596,0.2842,1.5052,1.0998,4.304,3.0824,5.7751,4.8723,0.0903,6.0893,5.0054,1.2816,0.8548,3.5397,0.0036,1.4406,3.852,4.4163,1.122,4.6787,2.0909,6.7958,3.0762,7.7187,6.916,4.5639,0.918,5.4914,0.1606,3.6397,6.436,1.6743,2.2608,0.0002,2.0504,1.0265,1.5219,2.1566,1.7709,1.0969,2.8752,3.4366,1.3283,4.4262,2.579,5.3782,6.3817,1.4427,4.1458,0.4237,3.5103,3.3855,1.7828,5.1703,2.5768,4.8107,4.58,4.4186,0.8909,2.2464,5.6171,5.0265,1.921,5.0799,0.5526,2.5468,1.9426,1.3284,3.3216,5.2686,0.6776,2.4241,0.2222,6.4035,4.147,2.3202,3.5094,0.7728,0.1561,1.3796,5.9029,2.1268,1.9937,2.4895,3.0167,0.9691,1.2563,2.3507,3.496,3.8618,2.7513,2.1788,3.1003,2.6275,1.2649,1.8284,3.2866,4.4084,4.8553,3.921,0.0811,2.2547,1.9822,2.3063,0.397,1.1927,5.9284,5.1848,0.1051,7.4869,6.4866,0.6389,7.1363,2.858,3.793,3.4768,2.2822,4.2134,1.0501,3.1375,2.1482,6.2391,2.6099,0.0235,0.0233,2.1546,6.696,2.41,2.6577,4.2328,5.7199,4.0716,3.2746,5.3697,0.4246,4.5336,1.9667,0.1225]}

The use of steroids has been proposed to improve oral function, increase the blood glucose level during the day, enhance circulation of blood, and improve blood flow among the person by improving control of cholesterol in the system. In general, steroids have been effective in eliminating cholesterol during the day and lowering blood glucose level, with long duration performance improvement and a high amount of lipid free concentration, improving blood circulation, lowering the risk of chronic disease, and achieving good cholesterol reduction.\nOn the other hand, cholesterol is a substance which is a lipid in which the amount of the fatty acids is smaller than the amount of the endovascular lipid. Furthermore, cholesterol is an active substance and therefore has long term side effects such as inflammation, lowering blood glucose level, and reduction of plasma cholesterol. Recently, antiinflammatory drugs have been developed to reduce the LDL (bad cholesterol) levels. There is a need to synthesize anti-inflammatory drug by the drug administration method and to take into consideration the possibility of the lowering of cholesterol levels by steroid composition.\nAs disclosed above, to decrease the body weight, cholesterol has been employed to enhance the blood glucose level. However, the cholesterol is an active substance and therefore has long term side effects such as inflammation, lowering plasma cholesterol, and reduction of plasma cholesterol. Anti-inflammatory drugs have been developed to reduce the body weight. Recently, the body weight which may be reduced by steroid composition has been studied.\nThe drug administered to the body during daily exercise has been studied in the past. However, there is required a drug for reducing the body weight. This subject is solved with an object to find a drug suitable for reducing the body weight and reducing the body weight.","token_len":518,"entropy":[8.7216,7.5658,13.5735,2.6013,1.803,4.7341,0.0028,4.4088,1.0261,7.4174,3.3028,0.5312,1.5946,5.0807,0.3892,1.9201,0.1542,9.546,1.3278,0.1586,1.6678,5.807,0.0059,2.7831,4.3533,1.9321,5.4347,0.5057,2.8003,0.0102,0.2324,1.8069,7.4101,0.3289,3.1844,4.6728,1.8745,1.0945,2.2635,10.6244,2.846,6.1303,5.7146,0.0324,1.7982,2.3995,12.7757,9.8686,4.488,1.5023,3.5434,0.2855,1.009,3.0978,0.4346,5.5254,6.7259,4.27,1.8197,5.4459,2.3769,0.9825,2.9255,0.1139,2.0349,4.2314,3.4762,3.964,3.5162,2.6427,1.5977,3.4139,5.6754,3.2834,3.6095,1.2975,5.0619,0.0431,5.6188,6.3276,6.7265,0.1765,4.1173,2.8573,4.312,5.2586,0.014,2.9005,3.6104,1.6065,1.8383,3.2126,6.5447,4.2061,0.9159,0.4278,1.3697,12.7041,0.0509,0.0678,1.0534,0.0493,5.9583,4.4444,2.4572,3.6191,0.0101,3.7626,5.2086,0.7171,5.8924,1.0284,4.2395,1.0621,3.3533,0.132,2.7622,7.689,3.6446,0.5207,5.3654,0.0531,2.7585,3.4208,0.3051,2.8006,1.1769,3.9476,0.9156,3.0886,6.8861,6.1256,5.844,4.2002,1.339,5.6357,4.33,7.2115,7.271,3.9099,0.0284,0.0021,2.224,3.2474,0.3103,5.2394,3.7818,0.9045,7.1951,5.792,0.2074,5.3927,0.9062,3.6116,0.8316,2.3337,1.7533,5.5575,0.01,2.4589,2.1612,1.7653,0.7598,0.8616,1.4839,0.3696,2.8007,1.8344,1.64,1.2657,3.811,0.1863,1.6986,0.3032,0.9215,0.2502,0.0775,1.2176,2.2839,2.1611,0.0053,0.7159,1.823,0.5237,2.3795,0.1543,0.4784,1.8042,1.6973,2.0876,9.2263,0.6008,5.0472,3.4067,1.3955,5.9339,1.5436,3.3145,0.5902,3.6369,5.1692,3.3839,2.2548,1.93,1.0908,1.4104,2.8969,1.0861,6.5496,0.9789,6.9941,5.7072,2.4601,7.0447,0.2538,3.3858,4.3417,0.2344,4.2944,0.4798,2.7889,3.7824,0.0682,2.0348,1.5115,0.433,5.9227,0.5636,7.401,3.1745,5.448,0.7409,0.858,1.4409,4.1784,1.3695,0.5891,2.202,2.6142,4.5537,6.3023,5.2179,6.8508,4.6499,2.1662,2.9888,3.8345,5.2777,0.0085,4.4849,4.2382,5.9751,2.6274,5.8768,2.5011,2.1563,1.6569,4.0265,2.0861,1.923,0.0868,5.8784,2.2004,0.9735,0.5478,5.7007,4.5867,3.5401,3.9089,0.6399,1.1515,6.254,0.2781,0.1895,0.0197,0.0161,6.2595,1.355,1.3732,5.1108,1.5083,1.0589,3.1631,4.0649,2.823,3.2541,1.5161,4.8014,0.1787,3.6764,3.3236,0.3782,1.309,5.5993,0.4433,0.7475,0.612,0.0753,0.607,5.4946,2.1632,0.0081,4.6966,1.2175,5.196,0.0201,2.5747,0.819,2.5159,4.0919,3.0208,3.0577,3.9422,3.0253,5.2796,1.4393,4.0678,0.0661,3.2417,0.0144,4.6137,0.6881,6.0315,0.9732,1.8716,2.0767,0.3362,0.9734,5.8284,0.4579,3.6749,1.8436,1.2393,6.6116,0.1707,5.8483,4.9359,0.8752,1.2515,0.1859,2.4003,0.9203,1.5806,0.8926,6.0874,3.7183,1.7303,1.085,0.2651,2.7624,2.2608,4.7491,1.2102,1.5909,2.5161,1.057,6.3048,0.0128,3.7199,0.5713,0.2914,4.7688,4.2122,2.7319,5.9961,3.9435,3.1097,2.3109,1.154,4.7618,3.1826,1.3385,0.5394,5.1594,0.4194,2.3449,5.5046,0.1522,1.971,2.2664,2.4313,4.6902,8.8438,0.7385,1.1325,4.3186,8.3956,1.8315,0.0631,5.8437,4.4397,0.7558,5.1122,2.1688,1.7522,4.214,2.5901,0.8706,5.9527,1.3018,2.9032,0.7072,3.8979,1.5058,0.5229,1.4431,3.0818,0.0072,1.5913,4.9451,2.382,3.2364,1.4935,0.4314,0.8889,1.6845,0.8627,0.087,0.1462,0.0095,0.0055,0.4209,0.0013,0.0868,0.1001,0.2255,6.4187,0.0107,0.4188,0.2718,1.7407,0.0026,1.1054,0.7669,0.1637,5.8628,0.766,0.0746,0.0859,0.4752,0.1396,0.3645,0.0558,0.8991,0.024,3.2528,0.0007,2.0037,5.9978,0.0032,7.0623,8.1669,0.1972,8.13,3.7663,0.469,2.915,0.6705,1.274,0.1005,0.5117,0.0846,3.1672,1.3413,2.8351,2.0321,6.0641,5.2084,1.0456,1.3861,2.6375,2.909,4.5915,3.0525,1.7483,0.4865,3.5475,2.2849,2.0182,4.3656,0.9146,2.9234,0.0075,2.4268,1.0984,10.6414,3.6546,5.8911,3.1722,4.8229,0.4422,0.8871,0.0317,1.2897,3.379,6.9028,1.6245,9.5564,3.2955,3.2291,6.9526,2.5195,6.4007,1.3967,1.5748,4.0152,0.2949,3.3544,0.2196,0.2222,0.0133,2.466,4.5536,0.4474,2.9163,1.6514,2.05]}
{"id":4795,"ended":false,"length":364,"text":"Although a state of hostilities existed between the Mam and the K 'iche'of Q 'umarkaj after the rebellion of the Kaqchikel against their former K 'iche'allies prior to European contact, the K'iche'were able to defeat the Mam in a series round of battles, before the Mam of Q 'umarkaj, who had an alliance with the Mam, was forced to declare war between the Mam of Q 'umarkaj and the Mam of the K'iche ', the K'iche'who then surrendered themselves to the Mam of Q 'umarkaj.\n\nThe Mam of Q 'umarkaj was ultimately determined to remain neutral and only accept the offers of the K 'iche'when they surrendered themselves to the Mam, as in previous battles. However, as a result of their efforts to defend the Mam of K 'hoqarkarkark after the rebellion, the Mam of Q 'umarkaj was forced to surrender his ally to the Mam of the K 'iche'and was in turn forced to surrender his ally to the Mam of Q'umarkaj.\n\nIn 1614, the Mam of K'hoqarkark joined forces with the Mam of K 'hoqarkarkark and was the second-in-command of the Mam. However, the Mam, during his brief stay in Q'umarkarkark, was attacked by the Mam.\n\nAftermath\nThe Mam of Q 'umarkarkark's defeat was one of the most important events in the history of West Africa. During his stay in Q'umarkarkark, Mam had to deal with both the K'iche'and the Mambarians. The Mam of Q'umarkarkark did not want to fight any wars.

{"id":3344,"ended":true,"length":457,"text":"At the outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939, M\u00f6lders'Staffel was stationed in the west protecting Germany's border in the Mosel \u2013 Saar \u2013 Pfalz region. On 8 September 1942, on the 30th Anniversary of World War II, a platoon of \"staffel officers\" of the Suez Canal Company made two attempts to cut through Mosel, but was unsuccessful. \"A German submarine landed in the Mosel\", the German navy told Allied forces, \"and M\u00f6lders'Staffel, which had saved Germany and its allies, escaped into the open sea\" on 4 September 1942.\n\nOn 9 September 1942, he was put on retreat after being caught by an Italian submarine on board the Nuremberg-bound ship Mosel. The Italian submarine was to fire to stop him but its surface radar intercepted his movement and cut a hole in Mosel's hull. \"An Italian submarine attacked the Mosel and I was severely hit in the knee and had to be treated in hospital\", a British Air Force colleague said. M\u00f6lders also encountered an unknown Italian submarine shortly before the war ended.\n\nM\u00f6lders' final escape, during World War II in the Red Sea on 7 August 1944, occurred near Lihn, which had just reopened. The German naval forces were in position in the area and were still within their patrol zone at around 3 pm. The Allies were at the same time aware of the sinking of a German submarine in the Red Sea. The sinking of Mosel was also an example of submarine sabotage. A German submarine, one of the first to be sunk in the Black Sea, reportedly sank by its dive from near the Red Sea. The German navy suspected the accident and started an investigation into the matter. They also warned of the risk of collision in the Black Sea if the submarine collided with the German vessels.\n\nOn 25 September 1944, he was released. After eight months of captivity, he was transferred to the GDR for reassignment to the Mosel-Kriegers. During his prison sentence in November 1944 he was awarded the title of \"Sergeant of the Day\" for his heroism as a special patrol agent during the operation during Operation Barbarossa, while his colleagues reported on the submarine.

Sixty-one years later, the Germans have a picture of him on the GDR memorial statue in the southern city of Munich.","token_len":520,"entropy":[2.5476,7.8855,0.8239,1.8502,0.0101,0.5135,6.3789,6.2842,2.4616,1.6353,0.189,7.9976,4.453,4.3206,2.2783,7.7273,16.0361,2.3968,1.8035,5.0543,1.1342,1.4068,6.0826,11.6023,3.8181,0.7991,4.038,5.5495,0.7074,6.3678,4.6385,0.0711,13.3735,8.4254,0.2873,8.9263,10.677,4.1816,0.5438,1.7917,0.7857,3.8089,3.87,0.9208,4.1511,0.2467,3.9701,0.6421,6.4826,0.0323,5.1582,0.0414,3.1395,0.0096,0.3997,0.2041,3.3798,5.2977,0.2017,6.0979,6.0882,0.3061,3.2862,0.181,2.9975,0.4897,4.9117,6.2199,0.4973,1.4357,5.5854,5.8429,4.1712,0.211,6.0019,1.8275,4.1853,5.9471,0.0198,2.6479,1.3519,4.3387,2.7109,0.3587,5.0441,4.0676,4.1316,3.9097,5.7246,1.8879,0.6738,2.8509,0.004,0.0292,4.1847,2.8527,4.0246,5.0112,4.1141,7.1129,3.1105,1.3612,0.7475,0.7021,4.1043,0.6687,0.0059,0.0026,0.6967,0.1427,0.0021,3.9556,2.3024,0.875,6.7687,4.4306,3.5406,1.1747,2.4616,1.0747,6.2048,3.5496,0.3157,3.1614,0.5041,4.9441,2.7235,3.3216,0.8507,1.4289,0.2607,1.3883,0.0015,2.7011,2.6534,0.2238,1.0484,0.1206,6.6784,1.0687,5.6685,1.2736,8.8618,3.0699,2.1923,3.1022,1.6943,2.7493,2.5468,1.5916,3.0362,3.2409,1.3286,5.2922,1.6622,0.0245,2.6024,4.3425,3.2837,4.2309,1.1043,0.048,0.866,2.1432,4.5215,2.1293,2.0175,4.9885,5.4395,5.8005,3.4619,2.6282,2.3775,4.8048,7.2152,6.4761,4.0781,1.3735,4.6513,1.0656,5.9108,4.2654,2.4031,0.2267,2.4006,0.2135,0.0056,0.2435,0.7963,0.4766,2.6529,5.1299,2.3242,1.5166,4.3332,1.3319,2.9043,0.0053,0.0111,1.9045,6.2009,1.3533,4.6001,4.8985,2.9148,0.1161,4.6622,1.7216,4.5403,0.5979,0.516,4.6681,2.462,0.8565,2.6489,4.802,3.8533,6.1264,0.384,7.6666,2.4491,0.3966,3.1659,0.0379,0.0061,0.0024,5.7468,5.9131,2.6738,3.4019,4.2814,0.7458,5.8208,2.4199,1.7396,3.6281,1.3788,0.6593,0.9495,0.0002,2.6976,0.0846,0.0047,0.0023,1.0153,11.8615,5.7611,4.0016,4.4302,2.8715,0.003,0.1613,4.3323,1.6625,5.319,0.313,3.9397,3.174,2.9627,1.5971,0.1234,3.7532,4.0299,4.8306,6.9742,2.7586,1.7607,4.547,2.7164,3.5923,5.7068,3.1033,2.209,3.397,3.3647,2.3882,2.1472,3.6702,3.9782,3.3019,0.54,2.1246,1.5348,2.0929,5.0801,6.1715,4.2291,5.3926,1.9845,3.6672,4.4389,3.0246,3.481,0.959,1.941,5.6286,2.2315,4.3833,1.2233,3.7156,0.3195,4.8622,0.6588,0.6692,4.5871,0.4442,2.8123,1.4112,0.5411,2.3777,0.5056,2.1834,0.0026,1.1131,2.0134,3.8746,0.7352,1.9448,0.7609,0.0073,1.4175,3.9132,3.5902,3.1252,0.0275,6.4619,5.9625,1.2782,3.703,2.5855,0.6072,2.6437,5.5525,0.2764,0.6739,2.2579,1.0919,2.2733,1.5077,1.5026,0.5697,6.2424,0.0106,0.5115,6.8578,3.435,4.2784,3.8202,7.0041,7.9226,5.0028,1.2133,4.3061,0.0313,1.3053,2.0433,2.91,1.9785,6.8958,1.9769,5.5094,2.1668,5.6986,2.4854,0.374,2.3224,0.6253,2.3254,0.3995,5.2534,2.663,5.8558,1.8445,1.2353,3.0996,0.3931,7.2388,4.1533,0.2815,2.8252,0.0065,3.6788,0.8927,1.3936,5.8817,0.1823,1.6523,2.7842,4.3374,0.7348,0.7734,0.0002,2.5052,4.1211,1.1781,0.9447,0.1272,4.2398,0.6362,4.648,3.251,4.0333,5.5671,0.9989,1.4371,2.2805,0.5201,0.9571,0.7635,2.2718,0.1168,0.9088,5.6827,3.6287,3.6165,7.2491,0.0318,0.7003,0.5799,5.4392,0.2709,0.0453,4.3996,4.2062,3.8932,7.4633,5.9918,3.4114,1.0133,6.5498,2.2005,2.6027,4.3265,1.4052,2.8594,0.7108,4.3083,1.0346,3.8418,0.6089,0.973,5.5967,0.059,1.3516,0.2039,5.4676,1.0885,2.0805,0.6896,2.7407,4.3658,0.888,5.1361,4.9482,5.9925,2.9143,0.3889,5.3274,6.2177,2.6851,1.9681,0.0017,0.0001,2.6543,5.1727,2.671,4.6717,6.4561,3.8004,1.6888,4.3046,3.7868,2.9009,5.9718,3.6349,4.8126,2.8982,3.4296,2.209,5.4061,1.9367,1.8289,0.6763,1.458,0.5854,4.2992,1.4523,3.3727,1.293,3.3584,4.6821,0.8085,7.3784,1.4012,0.5807,2.2847,3.1584,0.8854,0.2666,2.0306,4.4056,2.2617,4.1936,5.6828,0.1772,3.2793,1.9927,1.4916,4.8108,0.0076,4.282,4.4474,1.9685,1.9022,5.9001,2.1459,0.0621,4.4664,0.3849]}
{"id":2582,"ended":false,"length":404,"text":"Pluteus aurantiorugosus is very similar to P. nevadensis in external appearance, and the two can only be reliably distinguished by microscopic characteristics or DNA sequence. In contrast to the latter species, the pluteus aurantiorugosus is very similar to P. nevadensis in external appearance. It is found in a small number of other species, including, the common pluteus aurantiorugosus  and those of the ornithiform species. The pluteus aurantiorugosus is mainly concentrated among the plant and tree species. At the base of the pluteus aurantiorugosus is a cluster of hairs, two to three centimeters long and weighing up to 100 grams. The hairs that are present here are very small. In the genus Pluteus, pluteus aurantiorugos has six species, named after the pluteus aurantiorugosus.\n\nDescription\n\nThe pluteus aurantiorugosus is very small, containing only a single species of dorsal fin, about one-inch long and weighing up to 75 grams. The long dorsal fin is made from a hard and smooth leather which forms a large, circular tip. It is long in the front, as described earlier. The dorsal fin is made of a short, rigidly-made surface. The dorsal fin measures about 2\u20143 mm long. About 11.5 mm in the dorsal fin, about 3\u20145 mm in the front, and about 7.5 mm in the back. In the back of the dorsal fin is a circular, flanks-shaped tip, that consists of a narrow, long shaft. At its base is a long, curved shaft that constitutes a large, narrow groove. The dorsal fin is made of a short, rigidly-made surface. The dorsal fin has a sharp portion at the end of a thin rod. The dorsal fin has a flat shaft. The dorsal fin is covered with a short, straight line through which the dorsal fin goes.\n\nDistribution and culture\nIn the wild, pluteus aurantiorugosus is found in many species in the genus Pluteus. Among them are also a little less specific. Like many species of the plant, the plant can only be found in Asia and Africa, and in many other places in the world.\n\nAt least 1\u20142 of the pluteus aurantiorugosus species reside in the Philippines, Brazil and Bolivia.\n\nReferences","token_len":521,"entropy":[7.4062,9.2849,7.7035,1.7777,5.5646,10.8578,3.3795,1.0278,3.4033,5.679,2.5533,0.2174,4.8961,1.5434,7.9941,2.8482,4.3035,1.2946,2.6891,10.2128,1.7285,1.2426,1.9622,2.9391,3.1859,5.2991,5.0314,0.2856,9.8525,1.3475,0.7441,6.5062,6.2576,5.5759,6.9745,2.5064,1.031,3.0308,2.686,1.654,1.6639,3.9203,3.3633,0.1978,1.5616,6.8172,1.0098,0.0106,0.8951,0.0023,0.0106,0.0211,0.0069,0.0026,1.1213,3.2425,1.4728,0.4424,0.5004,0.0185,0.9296,0.0038,0.0027,0.0002,0.337,1.8622,0.0408,2.4087,2.7575,0.9227,3.5947,0.6226,3.4262,3.46,1.4269,0.0071,4.4563,2.299,1.2319,1.5819,5.3397,4.5589,4.272,2.6532,0.2114,0.2174,2.0953,0.0694,0.0506,0.0682,0.0236,0.0148,9.2568,7.0807,7.3772,1.4996,1.1695,6.4481,0.3134,6.0437,4.904,2.2047,1.9119,1.6094,0.0147,0.0104,0.075,0.0048,0.0043,0.0067,0.0032,0.0031,0.8234,5.7243,6.8844,5.1309,1.0908,6.6355,3.2779,4.2756,1.2375,1.7559,6.0573,1.4302,3.2673,0.1023,0.3032,3.2028,0.0159,0.0149,0.5775,0.0081,0.0044,0.0091,0.0032,0.0024,0.8063,0.5339,5.3028,0.0776,5.2955,2.1136,5.9848,1.4831,0.8683,2.8537,0.5941,1.865,5.5405,2.7212,0.0022,3.0363,0.8878,0.744,1.1653,0.7662,5.8143,1.8003,2.6663,5.4374,0.4561,3.4969,2.6813,2.2581,2.9097,1.266,4.4126,1.8168,0.1117,0.0375,0.833,4.2718,0.1871,0.031,0.3891,0.0048,0.0044,0.0154,0.0023,10.8499,5.1885,3.7406,1.2855,7.6669,1.5984,1.0403,4.1341,0.0682,1.1135,2.9466,0.0531,0.0439,0.1632,0.0191,0.2686,1.4036,3.0331,0.0027,5.5011,1.5013,0.0001,1.5108,0.7494,0.0096,0.0115,0.0389,0.0057,0.0032,0.0105,0.0027,0.0048,0.5737,3.8067,2.8521,1.0835,6.4885,0.8605,1.7476,1.3026,5.6906,1.4931,8.0346,2.4367,1.4392,4.2847,2.4245,1.3318,5.4783,0.8935,1.2,3.063,1.985,0.0042,5.3103,0.0778,0.2174,0.9554,4.2716,2.861,0.2932,0.8737,5.1401,1.9099,1.3564,5.2747,3.7322,3.8648,5.0413,4.062,3.7402,0.6975,4.8645,2.0843,4.687,5.2051,0.9982,2.3555,0.769,4.4838,3.6716,2.8505,3.0419,1.1638,4.4918,5.1893,3.5014,1.4681,0.7889,2.2278,0.1661,0.6137,4.0811,0.8632,1.0195,5.2155,1.0063,5.59,6.0947,2.5134,6.906,5.4129,2.1767,0.8247,2.3228,0.3378,7.1099,0.6632,2.9233,8.8447,0.6306,1.847,1.4081,1.5225,6.233,6.5451,2.6918,0.3901,1.1303,1.7453,4.9694,4.2731,0.528,1.4079,3.3707,2.4658,4.5724,2.2458,0.0754,0.557,0.4542,1.8866,0.4458,1.248,0.365,2.9456,1.4069,0.258,0.0617,0.1277,0.034,0.5162,0.6747,2.9832,0.5861,3.0444,1.7469,0.0868,0.7244,0.025,1.4049,0.3497,4.568,1.789,5.3254,5.3863,0.9279,1.0517,3.9346,1.3298,4.1461,5.5239,0.089,0.9708,4.0519,1.1266,4.0281,4.5774,1.7656,3.6638,2.4666,0.5592,0.7277,0.218,2.9563,0.5094,3.1908,3.8566,1.7581,8.0552,0.5303,3.6114,0.8404,3.5353,4.8242,0.8192,0.8183,2.5647,0.2299,0.6864,2.7452,0.4759,0.6421,4.7017,0.1673,1.3869,0.1223,0.0184,0.0467,0.3429,0.6062,0.8228,0.5253,0.0781,3.0844,0.7477,4.5632,9.0879,2.6275,0.5553,2.5324,2.0638,2.6904,4.7763,5.1373,1.8498,0.8432,1.146,0.156,2.0492,0.4031,4.6136,5.3363,2.4278,0.7432,0.6675,0.1883,0.7217,4.4529,0.7025,0.7173,4.256,0.4296,4.5564,4.9987,5.6325,1.2081,1.0601,1.3692,0.2745,6.0139,1.7468,2.3922,0.0003,4.7663,0.1144,2.0276,8.999,0.2091,18.534,1.2547,3.288,0.3151,1.5968,0.0932,0.0135,0.0501,0.0047,0.0053,0.0172,0.0014,0.0028,0.7121,1.4112,0.6904,2.4779,3.5901,2.6037,1.2676,3.4794,1.1707,0.0469,0.0489,0.9739,4.3404,1.7428,0.7928,6.3183,2.7102,6.4139,5.0331,6.9554,5.5982,5.7775,2.5907,1.9729,0.5848,1.9086,5.0295,1.2866,1.4961,5.0765,3.6901,2.5101,0.2982,0.9734,0.274,5.9019,1.4088,1.6255,1.2568,1.4022,2.4714,3.2695,1.5096,2.335,1.6028,0.3469,0.3018,0.3807,3.0715,0.0002,5.8883,2.9687,3.7419,4.4778,1.0992,3.3164,0.4836,1.6046,0.0575,0.0115,0.0371,0.0081,0.0059,0.0052,0.0012,0.0045,0.9938,5.2584,0.1364,1.3335,5.658,0.994,5.4744,2.4781,4.737,0.4235,2.5036,0.0002,5.3882]}

Although AML can be treated by an inter-actuated approach (the Interactuated Model option), it may also involve a third party.\n\nIn order to overcome any of these difficulties, I\u2019ve developed the concept AML which refers to an initial state of consciousness that is characterized by loss of sensation and pain. It is the state of consciousness where the body, along with the mind and all its organs, are able to experience themselves again. When the body is unable to deal with the loss of sensation, pain and loss, the pain becomes as much an annoyance to the body as it is to the mind.\n\nAfter a few months, the condition ceases to occur and the loss becomes painful as more pain becomes worse and more pain is more painful.\n\nAlthough most people have experience with AML, I personally know many people who experience it as an occasional annoyance that prevents them from being able to work for a full life.\n\nThe first step to overcome MDS is to understand the causes, how they have caused the discomfort and how they can be managed. Myself, I\u2019m trying hard to understand what the most common causes are and how we can change or limit the causes.\n\nOnce I know the causes of both pain and discomfort, I will help my users understand this, but also help them to use this knowledge as evidence which can allow them to make real and effective change in their lifestyles and the way they live.\n\nAt my website AML is already available to download and use, and in order to get this link activated, you also need to have this link activated so that it can be viewed.

{"id":522,"ended":false,"length":455,"text":"At the beginning of the 20th century, Rudyard Kipling referred to lines 69 and 70, alongside three lines from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Kubla Khan, when he claimed of poetry : ``My poetry [are] a mirror of my nature.\"\n\nIn his autobiography \"The Last Words of Poetry,\" Rudyard Kipling wrote that \"the poem-writing, the poetic form... is the secret to any soul.\"  Kipling did not intend the words quoted by Taylor Coleridge to be poems.  In fact, they were merely fragments of a dialogue between two individuals and a poem.  At the time, Kipling had not published any poetry in English as a poem.\n\nIn later years, Kipling used the term poet as a broad metaphor because his poems were often described as \"poems.\"  In those times, he has claimed that the phrase \"poem\" was used by a \"poetic genius\", who was more than happy to indulge his poetry.\n\nPraise\nAlthough Kipling has claimed to have \"written 50 poems\", he has said that he would \"not have given up poetry\". He has written \"I Have a Love for Poetry\" (1955), but in his \"Poetry No.\" (2008), Kipling writes :\n\n\"The poem-writing, the poetic form... is the secret to any soul. When I was young, my mother was a poet, although at that time she was nothing more than a poetic genius... Her poems were of such a nature that they were just poems, only of such a nature that they could be written by the writer.\"\n\nColeridge, who considered Kipling the \"poetic genius\" of the early nineteenth century and the author of \"Protec\" (1912), also considered Kipling as \"poetic genius\".\n\nCriticism\n\nT.P. Griffith criticised Kipling's poetry as \"poem-writing\", citing 'poetry in the end of life' as his primary objective.  Griffith also criticised Kipling's poetry as \"poem-writing\" and stated that Kipling's literature \"does not consist in the words of one man.\"\n\nIn a review at the New York Times, Griffith called Kipling \"a brilliant writer, and in fact he is often called ''poetic genius\"\".

All the wind, rain and snow that may come from your home is likely to be harmful for you and your home.\n\nIt may also be a hazardous ride. If it continues to weaken, the risk to you and\/or your home and its home occupants is increased.\n\nWhile it may be possible to evacuate your home to other areas where you are most at risk, there are times that your home may be at a disadvantage. There is no need to evacuate your home from power or other utilities until you can locate the power provider.\n\nAvoid driving while under high winds and without warning. Drive slowly so that when you are on your vehicle, your vehicle is as close to the ground as possible. When you are inside your car, make sure of your steering wheel, and rear wheel driveshaft.\n\nAvoid driving while in heavy rain, and any other conditions that may be dangerous. The risk that you may become stranded due to extreme weather is far lower if you have enough food.\n\nIf you are unable to leave your home until you are able to evacuate from your home, visit us at stormwaterplanning.com today.\n\nIf you have any questions about storm planning and hurricane risk, please do not hesitate to call\/mail us at tropical hurricanesplanning@shanghai.cc in a timely manner.","token_len":523,"entropy":[10.2103,4.4621,5.5128,11.357,7.2201,8.7003,5.1732,0.579,5.1821,0.3634,0.2022,3.4363,2.5531,3.6332,3.5988,0.581,3.3135,6.2347,0.7211,4.3699,5.4059,0.0045,0.781,4.539,3.3676,3.5944,4.3797,3.869,2.0511,7.409,4.7699,10.5871,0.6059,1.4023,3.0506,3.6042,2.7824,0.0094,4.0334,2.4793,4.0033,3.2548,3.8395,3.5915,1.4936,3.2928,0.5626,3.9503,2.2092,3.2826,5.5734,0.3462,4.5414,1.561,1.4647,2.4133,0.2419,0.041,2.2581,4.1231,6.1806,1.5292,2.4154,0.7884,0.0005,4.7079,4.3194,1.5909,5.0457,5.5438,0.6232,1.0829,3.4473,2.5508,1.6711,3.5347,7.3487,3.3284,0.1032,1.5295,0.0928,1.2283,4.1192,0.7063,1.1295,2.7626,2.0317,5.2177,0.1972,2.6194,5.3454,2.8052,2.4023,2.9867,4.7129,5.4065,5.4456,5.4694,4.032,4.1653,5.4878,0.4101,6.6599,3.4097,3.4182,3.7655,0.1068,6.9173,5.3886,0.0136,0.0576,7.2394,6.1718,2.2453,0.5629,0.3776,0.6586,0.0003,5.5128,5.2519,0.0211,2.729,5.038,0.6883,4.1407,1.3244,5.4543,4.8196,3.4855,2.4901,3.3979,1.6942,3.7056,0.976,4.2609,2.0287,4.7047,0.6024,1.7504,5.1472,1.5524,2.4255,0.6129,0.0002,2.5055,2.8666,1.0445,1.8471,0.8907,1.4484,0.0001,4.2858,3.143,0.8335,0.6158,5.6242,3.7295,13.4174,8.2149,4.5709,3.4336,1.3181,1.0851,2.9444,1.3662,0.8899,4.8253,0.0757,1.1221,3.9689,0.0298,3.1708,2.933,2.9532,1.2611,2.3671,2.4062,3.2257,5.392,6.1007,3.1817,1.6445,5.5664,0.7008,3.628,7.8072,1.2348,1.1319,3.9922,6.2722,2.2489,6.3023,2.3543,1.9761,2.9176,0.4294,3.9844,0.8474,4.2654,6.0262,1.5165,3.0602,3.246,0.001,2.952,3.1369,0.8515,4.754,2.7131,1.0687,1.2519,0.0001,4.4774,2.2882,1.8231,2.0173,0.0001,4.6139,3.1117,5.767,0.3473,7.2882,0.2626,1.4634,5.94,0.7814,4.878,0.7474,1.939,2.2268,2.7438,0.5359,1.7799,4.8886,4.704,4.1267,2.8549,0.5611,2.9081,2.6733,5.4669,2.067,5.5829,2.0775,1.801,5.5213,2.5688,0.1695,1.1439,6.0107,4.7848,6.4161,2.4131,0.7644,0.5129,2.1562,1.2883,2.9184,2.1363,1.6486,2.8589,0.44,2.3382,2.1549,0.127,2.1897,3.4636,4.2524,1.1611,1.0313,0.4143,3.4457,0.4019,1.1837,0.0002,4.9692,2.8616,1.0487,0.4002,3.1968,8.9888,9.5344,1.7868,2.3449,3.8679,4.338,0.3226,2.537,0.7664,2.9593,2.741,2.8935,1.6166,0.6485,4.9698,0.0004,0.3615,1.2178,3.3723,3.543,7.5737,4.9036,1.1419,2.1503,0.3665,0.864,0.0001,5.2702,2.1013,1.2433,0.9659,1.8005,0.3888,3.142,0.7929,0.2272,3.7466,4.4049,2.3626,4.5011,2.0239,2.3035,3.6501,2.0428,0.0156,0.5456,3.1963,0.8159,4.666,3.0547,3.5448,0.6487,0.9422,0.8371,2.0781,2.8606,3.9192,0.9305,4.5717,1.4956,0.879,4.4275,0.0899,1.2544,0.9431,0.186,4.0162,6.7116,2.0936,1.8036,4.7193,4.0758,1.0694,2.2586,5.1718,2.2894,2.5058,3.2705,1.6852,0.6261,0.0001,4.1763,4.1571,4.1165,3.1117,4.446,1.239,1.414,6.2986,3.7662,0.5355,5.198,2.7602,4.8508,1.1037,5.4408,0.8541,1.6131,3.566,2.0046,3.5746,0.7695,2.745,2.3236,0.9621,5.4817,3.0428,0.2146,0.5529,2.4616,0.0938,0.132,0.6142,3.4592,0.9034,0.4857,5.7147,1.2048,2.0592,0.271,2.8,0.0953,7.3384,1.9514,5.1354,0.3046,1.7416,3.0161,6.2312,2.6022,7.5644,2.7639,0.2401,0.5657,0.9673,0.0001,2.6285,2.0821,2.6092,2.8696,3.9738,0.4831,1.634,3.2027,6.4898,2.0747,1.6775,0.7998,0.8824,2.1884,3.3978,1.1423,3.6421,1.9899,4.732,0.9193,1.0377,3.609,1.9753,5.5624,0.0016,3.2371,0.575,0.9884,4.2415,4.5135,3.3318,0.3151,2.8236,6.0446,4.5437,3.8006,0.8501,0.0001,2.2521,0.2498,1.086,3.7264,0.0644,3.8195,0.1444,0.2149,4.9322,1.0501,1.2494,2.2894,0.0073,2.7688,4.0682,1.5025,0.5293,0.2892,5.8861,7.8374,1.2788,5.6648,2.6606,7.1845,0.3562,0.2741,0.6499,6.905,1.5081,0.9493,0.0002,2.5482,0.2077,1.446,0.9419,0.4007,1.0914,2.3417,4.726,3.1511,3.154,3.4426,0.6571,1.1941,4.4046,0.1479,0.0059,0.0053,1.4895,7.9648,3.8677,0.492,0.4229,6.198,10.7776,4.2167,0.0455,0.0762,7.9456,3.1993,0.0415,0.6472,6.3994,6.4261,6.5116,2.5094,0.102,0.3127]}

Two of them are radioactive, and three are expected to decay but have not done so under laboratory conditions. The two natural radioactive isotopes, Cadmium and Cc, are all produced by a common family of poly-fluorinated polymers, while the third nuclear family, Cc-S, is produced from an identical polyfluorinated polymeric mixture.....\n\nCadmium\n\nThe basic composition of Cadmium, which is the most common element in our bodies (in the Universe), is described as\n\nClosed and Fe\n\n(In order to give an exact translation of the atomic formula from French to English, Cadmium \u2192 Cl2 and Cl3 \u2192 Cl1). With all those four atomic elements separated by one nucleotide there is no atomic chemical formula, which distinguishes Cadmium from any other element.\n\nCadmium and Fe are the 2,2-dicarboxylic acid atoms which are bound together by their atomic groups. For Cadmium we have a compound with a basic structure of\n\nCadmium\n\n, which is the smallest molecule in the Universe and is the second-largest chemical compound.\n\nTetravaler is a rare molecule which consists as well of five groups (T1, T2, T3, T4, and T11), with various other members (such as cadmium).\n\nThe term tetravaler, i.e. the corresponding compound in Cadmium, was created at the beginning of the 15th century (died around the 13th century) as a reference to the possibility that the hydrogen atoms in the molecule could form hydrogen atoms. They were believed to be part of a complex between hydrogen and helium atoms. Tetravaler was found to have a lower molecular mass than the group of atoms in the molecule tetravaler was derived of (3,859) atoms atoms.\n\nTetravaler did not form hydrogen atoms, but is likely to be a complex between hydrogen and helium in the same way tetravaler (2,4,890) is likely to form hydrogen atoms.\n\nTetravaler was used in the early discovery of CdCd, and its use as a fuel source for solar power has led to the development of a variety of other nuclear fuel sources, which are expected to continue to power our lives until much later, when it is no longer necessary to be produced.","token_len":524,"entropy":[10.8233,10.772,0.3465,0.0054,3.0994,6.9792,0.2606,7.1032,5.2474,0.1047,2.814,4.8322,0.6896,2.8697,0.4693,5.7735,1.6517,1.89,3.0667,0.3383,7.8988,0.1719,4.098,7.6407,3.5157,1.3306,6.513,0.0717,7.7821,2.366,0.3189,0.2272,1.6246,3.6307,7.3842,2.7341,0.6279,0.0073,1.3929,7.6957,0.0731,0.0117,1.257,3.8966,5.9003,1.6145,0.5534,5.1278,3.6827,0.8103,3.1701,4.6443,4.7419,0.1339,7.3552,3.6339,5.0116,0.4884,2.2838,3.3089,1.1946,1.3724,4.9636,0.658,2.3961,6.1106,4.6241,0.5428,2.1363,2.0789,3.3566,5.8933,0.5805,0.3797,1.3231,1.7197,3.1094,5.8758,4.1474,5.4418,0.383,0.1456,1.4593,2.5809,4.5209,13.0536,1.8706,0.083,2.9312,0.5646,0.0047,0.0006,3.1782,0.0003,2.0601,6.0179,3.0638,0.1926,1.5574,0.0201,0.0004,3.3974,2.6517,0.6516,3.191,1.9251,1.6123,2.5081,0.4767,3.984,3.3856,4.164,3.5879,1.9912,6.8166,0.9858,0.2617,6.7908,1.7551,4.4679,0.0002,6.5292,3.0207,4.573,7.4083,5.4183,0.0003,3.5515,5.5189,4.7293,0.1656,3.8921,1.7326,2.5212,5.2801,0.9027,1.0122,5.193,2.5751,3.9349,6.5554,0.7074,0.6086,0.4597,5.7749,0.0403,0.0056,7.8366,3.0977,6.5906,4.2476,2.1631,1.2397,0.119,1.4513,3.6275,4.0483,6.0893,4.3258,4.3908,5.6886,5.9851,2.2389,5.2922,2.1581,3.1024,5.6527,0.68,4.7012,0.589,1.5936,7.2465,6.772,2.4867,2.5687,2.8766,7.5093,1.6527,0.027,0.0026,0.2219,2.7218,0.1541,0.4597,0.7477,1.2353,0.0003,1.6233,0.2456,0.0138,0.002,3.6674,3.0035,0.8682,2.2007,6.4343,2.591,3.489,0.9241,1.4555,5.8607,1.4472,0.025,0.1391,0.0272,0.3865,4.3523,3.1981,1.2593,5.7535,1.7348,0.6485,4.1579,5.0973,3.7268,0.8281,4.9813,2.9743,0.0115,0.0011,4.6709,1.2115,2.3881,5.1835,3.6568,1.3776,6.9109,2.4523,2.0284,2.8195,0.0002,2.3373,0.4776,0.0806,0.0248,1.8861,0.0003,5.7363,1.4857,0.6372,1.9319,4.8163,3.0621,1.4324,0.6279,1.514,2.7975,1.5079,2.3999,4.6769,3.4047,0.9999,4.7509,1.2297,1.6867,1.2693,0.0002,6.8724,2.7335,0.6547,5.8707,5.0657,4.5275,1.2876,5.5661,2.7844,1.4681,3.8998,8.3184,5.492,0.0583,5.6166,3.6548,3.3212,3.9681,3.5754,0.3628,0.1544,0.1981,0.183,0.1382,0.0733,0.5253,0.4117,0.062,0.6786,1.2432,0.1604,9.1742,2.1124,2.9809,6.0915,2.5114,3.9421,2.9063,3.7248,0.0023,6.0143,0.026,0.0198,4.2695,1.4631,0.0002,2.0426,5.9101,2.1423,0.1315,0.0026,0.0879,3.6552,7.2704,0.01,0.0009,0.9716,1.802,8.3312,2.9189,2.6156,3.4547,0.0199,0.0007,0.4995,3.0487,4.8181,4.935,0.6994,2.5394,0.0188,0.3373,5.784,0.0596,0.163,3.6704,5.4338,3.2519,4.72,2.5237,4.1347,0.0575,0.0813,1.4033,2.9837,0.4857,2.9759,0.32,0.7026,6.4353,1.4555,1.4806,5.0605,1.5548,1.9342,1.1088,3.6926,1.7154,2.5365,3.6738,1.5021,1.1256,5.4569,1.0625,4.7159,0.1321,0.8951,5.115,0.0231,1.1213,4.0975,6.5757,1.6663,0.5802,1.48,2.6715,1.1027,4.7891,0.0395,0.0041,0.1266,1.157,3.2313,0.9106,1.7651,1.5562,5.0519,2.3328,2.7502,0.4981,1.5248,6.9239,1.026,2.7731,2.1383,0.79,1.4476,7.0562,0.0863,0.0888,0.1858,2.2961,3.5187,7.5504,2.6581,5.7249,1.4024,3.6043,7.409,3.737,8.3253,7.9581,1.4444,0.9796,0.0002,2.6497,0.1213,0.0366,0.0121,0.0312,6.411,0.1899,3.1799,3.4183,0.7405,1.7411,0.7417,4.7832,5.4343,0.6634,1.9088,1.7987,5.1779,1.9903,1.1534,0.0858,0.1276,4.2376,1.1357,2.4191,0.8513,5.7481,0.0366,0.0136,0.0374,4.9318,3.5665,0.1739,4.9437,0.8748,1.9966,5.9917,0.3035,1.833,4.0375,0.032,3.9717,0.9747,0.2769,0.4046,1.1172,0.0002,2.2599,0.082,0.0275,0.0102,0.0182,1.7995,3.4005,1.5578,1.3018,3.089,5.5586,0.0667,6.256,2.518,6.7276,3.4805,1.6046,2.6304,3.2877,3.5457,2.7933,0.4907,5.543,3.3464,1.748,5.3357,2.3644,2.9608,2.8339,0.1352,0.9645,2.1255,0.0215,2.3549,3.9701,0.0035,3.0226,5.1798,1.7448,1.3472,1.9306,3.0654,1.6145,5.742,0.0272,3.581,0.8153,5.442,1.4295,3.3155,4.1667,4.8244,0.2957,3.5124,2.4267,3.1507,1.5058,3.5345,0.0062,1.2892,0.9866,5.1279,7.7551,1.4564]}

In the week following April 7, 2003, the book became the best-selling book ever, with a cumulative 941,500, including 1,531,900 sales. It is an important first-hand account of Goldstein's rise through the literary world, and of the creative world of the 1950s.\n\nIn a review for American Public Records Magazine, Susan Cooper, whose book \"The Rise of the Iron Lady,\" refers to the book, and the press, \"The Iron Lady\" makes a case that as a historical narrative, Goldstein had an important role to play in the literary revolution.\n\n\"In his first book, as a writer as a novelist, he spent nearly one-quarter of a century as a champion of the English language, a writer who was the first to admit that English literature is not the only literary work by a woman,\" Cooper wrote. \"Through a period of unprecedented growth in the publishing industry, the book shows how an aspiring novelist could do with a little bit of fiction, or at least a lot of it. As a poet, he would say he\u2019s known as a 'literary writer' in this context. A writer that was actually in her sixties or early seventies; she would say she would have enjoyed a bit of the genre writing style Goldstein favored.\"\n\nThe book also shows how Goldstein's early work was a mixture of criticism, criticism, and critical critical analysis, and how it ultimately served as the basis for the success of the \"Star-Star\" (as its publisher used to call it). In the beginning, the book was considered a \"publication,\" where readers could read the first 15 pages of it in print, while the book was considered a \"publication,\" where it was sold to independent collectors, and finally, Goldstein's agent published the book.\n\nHowever, the book never fully got off the ground, and in 2007 the New York Times called the book \"a nightmare.\" Goldstein admitted he still hadn't been successful with his novel \"Black Book,\" as it was a critical disappointment at the time.\n\n Goldstein's memoir is released in November 2014, and in it he writes that he wrote his last book before retirement.\n\n\u201cAt least I got to read it all at once. I can\u2019t express a feeling of pleasure at the time or the desire to share it any longer.\u201d Goldstein in a previous interview with The Times.","token_len":525,"entropy":[2.4913,5.7655,2.7144,5.92,9.3749,2.1064,3.7761,7.5791,0.0608,4.3322,0.1533,5.7677,4.5851,1.3078,11.6032,0.1502,1.501,3.6337,0.0009,7.1683,8.3541,3.0671,3.2047,1.8505,0.1764,0.044,0.5212,3.0191,2.2732,6.7638,2.2432,7.5314,3.7144,0.1278,1.9249,0.0399,1.3341,1.5874,4.5084,1.4204,3.2709,1.1937,0.2707,1.5327,4.0555,1.7079,2.3512,2.2229,4.7854,4.4883,5.947,0.1183,4.6062,5.3083,4.9338,2.2774,0.4993,4.6711,2.4512,0.1025,4.9007,3.6865,2.1179,3.0689,3.4668,4.7063,3.0751,5.4174,2.4826,1.9904,0.0689,0.0514,9.0471,0.0254,6.4563,3.7337,0.3933,4.7368,0.9721,1.1232,1.5207,3.1683,1.0345,5.7146,4.895,3.1068,1.4632,4.1295,0.0424,1.1723,1.0513,0.0006,2.4374,2.9014,5.2016,2.5508,5.4767,4.5876,9.5052,7.1541,0.7023,7.254,7.2405,1.1888,5.5743,1.9102,2.3663,1.3457,4.5314,0.4601,1.3648,7.5883,0.9898,1.1832,7.6096,0.0565,1.354,1.0698,2.8276,7.0949,3.1765,6.8425,0.8767,4.4639,4.2393,1.9961,0.2096,1.7892,5.804,1.7797,3.0971,1.0574,5.7051,1.6021,7.1719,4.4098,0.8505,6.1664,3.9928,3.2039,1.8398,0.8704,0.9746,0.0051,0.6234,1.2193,3.8816,2.6976,0.7089,1.9187,0.0002,1.2238,2.9432,2.8063,3.2189,1.756,0.4258,5.49,1.0716,2.1427,6.5072,2.1977,3.8425,0.2113,1.6567,5.8702,3.7463,4.7888,1.2991,2.6906,0.106,1.3728,0.5895,2.6296,0.7961,5.3039,0.254,0.9925,6.1275,1.6455,1.6174,2.7948,2.7547,1.0523,2.4871,3.1885,1.7849,0.9813,5.8416,0.4353,3.4237,3.9695,2.9203,1.9477,2.2712,1.5214,4.6184,4.8659,5.8503,2.251,1.6936,1.2349,0.3819,1.5126,0.2006,0.3868,6.1263,3.2868,3.9537,0.3316,4.6726,3.5853,2.2635,1.1415,3.3909,0.6923,0.3431,2.2279,3.157,6.3516,1.892,4.3378,6.6168,1.948,1.9483,4.8878,4.7977,1.9952,3.2322,3.1695,0.2833,6.4808,2.3443,4.5756,2.862,0.1079,1.09,2.9175,0.2745,1.374,2.3133,3.9019,1.1306,4.4263,0.4198,0.8454,3.6834,5.4774,3.8378,17.5117,7.3565,2.1411,6.2283,3.1146,1.4431,2.5416,4.6642,0.1471,2.9981,1.3152,3.3504,3.9739,4.988,1.4857,4.4012,2.1052,4.8734,2.7586,6.5683,4.0209,3.9508,4.7045,0.0141,2.4172,3.626,0.0519,0.0012,5.7968,3.1727,2.3201,2.1517,1.2363,4.2123,2.3299,5.5443,2.2297,3.7079,0.4406,2.4319,5.3017,7.1704,5.7918,9.8232,5.5351,1.9023,0.1196,0.0001,2.4544,1.1197,2.7622,2.9415,0.7278,2.1141,1.6354,3.5181,2.4441,2.0499,2.8732,6.5888,0.0318,6.1066,1.32,2.7664,1.9211,0.6417,3.5988,5.3344,2.7996,1.5549,2.1899,0.7293,2.6427,5.0454,4.7088,0.8216,1.4464,1.5504,0.233,1.3962,5.4267,0.131,1.4422,4.2635,6.698,2.7711,9.8479,1.4025,4.3602,4.0682,4.0588,2.9974,5.6232,0.4223,0.677,0.2266,2.228,2.932,1.7737,4.6157,0.5878,1.7357,0.7394,1.3612,4.7363,1.4913,3.1794,5.2472,1.6086,2.3564,5.0664,4.1942,0.9462,2.3418,1.686,3.6415,5.043,0.6957,1.0319,3.2901,2.6225,3.0254,1.3125,3.8259,1.5601,3.1801,1.1077,2.8949,0.7492,1.4617,1.3845,0.0375,2.6081,0.3519,2.9944,1.0274,3.7603,1.9181,4.6057,5.2726,2.1915,0.8771,3.6594,1.1522,8.5427,1.6211,7.0062,6.4833,1.0057,0.3148,2.0828,0.7969,0.0001,4.9939,0.0354,1.9478,1.0393,4.2824,4.4562,4.5491,0.9464,0.046,0.0006,1.1781,0.8749,2.6293,4.1766,2.6449,3.5309,0.0684,0.0785,2.8179,1.3052,0.3546,0.6987,1.6729,5.919,1.4626,3.6264,5.5041,3.3901,5.8306,3.7042,0.0158,3.3703,4.2502,2.5446,1.2825,3.5999,2.9838,6.4333,5.2011,0.5126,4.5002,2.402,1.2783,2.9993,5.1908,4.4898,4.4456,0.7894,0.2222,0.5437,6.2195,28.2955,1.3825,4.2668,3.7703,5.468,1.2599,3.964,2.9695,2.0565,1.1282,3.2272,3.8933,0.8208,2.9284,1.9189,1.0221,4.3425,2.9814,4.227,1.8514,4.4171,4.8034,1.2596,1.3791,0.0002,9.2041,7.3171,9.1014,4.4473,5.7632,3.2223,1.2934,2.3705,1.8053,4.7565,4.8417,0.2112,0.8253,1.7253,3.6456,11.1922,3.2578,0.0364,6.1742,5.0239,3.0236,0.4356,4.2903,2.9634,1.1686,3.4833,4.6246,1.9277,6.1068,0.2264,3.7158,0.6645,6.7821,2.902,0.4731,4.1539,6.6694,10.3776,6.1374,2.5957,4.541,0.3868,2.3288,1.7493,2.2989,2.8726]}

Katz (@pkazawatczkowski) November 16, 2019\n\nBaseball's Commissioner Rob Manfred told CBSSports.com on Sunday that Barry Bonds is the only NFL player to miss the playoffs.\n\nThe Hall of Fame outfielder was suspended by Major League Baseball after he threw out a three-team game during the ninth inning of a postseason game Friday.\n\nHe also was fined $8,000 for throwing the game that went in against the Mets. Barry Bonds was suspended for all 32 games of the 1992 season for his illegal use of a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nBonds first started playing for the Chicago White Sox in 1985. In 1987 he was the second-best hitting player in the major leagues. His second-best season went to the Atlanta Braves in 1994. Bonds hit.308 with 12 home runs.\n\nBonds played in almost all four major league seasons with the White Sox. He finished his seven-year career with 19 extra-base hits, 15 homers and 60 stolen bases. Since 1995, he has recorded at least 21 stolen-base attempts (17 in 2005, 13 in 2016). Bonds broke the MLB record by hitting.357 with 12 home runs in 2007.\n\nBonds first had been suspended for his illegal use of a non-disclosure agreement during the 1983 season. Bonds played for the Detroit Tigers for three seasons and was suspended for 19 games.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking to see Bonds\u2019 career turn around after that, but the best thing to do is look ahead,\u201d Dodgers\u2019 coach Don Garber said after Monday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve seen the way Bonds has looked back in the past. He\u2019s always been the biggest asset to us. But it\u2019s not like they were taking him from us and looking back and thinking, \u2018Oh, maybe [Cadon] should have been suspended or something. Or maybe a little bit more.'\u201d","token_len":525,"entropy":[10.7303,11.3141,1.3826,0.9353,9.1272,4.4788,0.172,1.8563,4.216,7.8494,0.01,0.1408,7.2401,2.939,4.4091,1.4515,3.4775,10.3774,8.1654,6.4095,3.7838,1.9991,3.17,1.9309,1.7609,1.8605,0.8471,3.6249,3.3629,3.3139,2.39,1.6269,1.4946,1.3334,11.4841,14.2088,5.9137,0.7203,4.8921,0.4549,6.9052,0.8845,1.4932,2.9626,7.4881,4.5981,5.3406,4.0527,0.146,2.4552,7.1025,2.7047,3.5946,0.8369,3.3133,4.1505,6.3324,2.7719,0.6462,4.9295,3.8088,3.1268,3.4876,4.084,5.1838,1.2106,0.0696,1.755,2.1327,0.3524,2.2361,3.2948,1.1144,6.1387,3.1514,0.052,5.9136,3.65,0.0445,2.0602,3.724,0.0209,2.0412,6.6314,0.0778,4.2534,3.6843,1.8791,4.3735,4.0297,3.0603,6.1621,8.0712,0.0002,0.0,0.0003,0.0001,0.0006,4.6989,3.7656,4.0997,8.225,4.18,4.7001,3.5883,4.4296,4.3635,0.051,4.5264,3.1142,2.3542,7.2472,0.0291,6.8717,3.7761,4.5414,8.3845,5.0957,8.594,10.2451,0.0087,2.4491,3.5387,0.0001,10.4239,0.2135,0.0012,5.787,0.0091,2.6128,5.5415,2.0618,0.0081,0.0,3.5211,3.8944,1.1216,0.0532,0.0016,1.9364,2.8016,0.2489,6.6381,0.0064,2.1242,2.8307,1.4156,5.5625,0.0774,0.9217,1.8602,0.6428,0.5358,2.2062,0.9305,0.0002,3.1252,4.6094,0.0265,0.4076,2.8074,2.1607,3.3568,1.8526,3.9622,0.0003,0.0041,2.8271,1.6562,4.4778,1.4064,1.9085,5.3411,0.092,6.8816,2.4147,4.4722,0.6039,6.5976,0.0221,0.672,1.4357,5.7764,0.3046,6.2463,1.8688,1.3462,0.0002,4.5778,3.3203,1.8768,1.7383,0.1704,5.1076,0.2022,0.544,1.0467,1.8759,2.8697,1.9824,5.207,4.8463,3.8268,9.2128,0.4489,3.8847,0.9045,5.5784,0.0878,1.724,1.4558,0.8815,5.4621,5.2556,0.5627,1.0677,0.4836,6.5087,1.4203,1.5674,3.0743,5.803,2.0081,0.0089,1.1504,5.3347,0.1224,2.5302,1.265,0.0215,1.1548,1.3915,0.0002,1.308,0.0166,6.3434,2.926,2.003,1.9815,0.138,4.877,1.1898,0.0069,0.3896,3.9359,1.461,2.8952,2.7725,1.6749,1.3283,2.9414,3.9423,2.4907,3.758,3.8035,2.933,0.206,0.5175,3.0811,0.1745,1.2678,3.6876,5.0017,2.958,0.7919,0.6689,5.2419,1.5633,2.3198,6.4609,0.0207,0.6112,3.8336,0.5553,2.824,2.1623,9.1613,12.1875,2.6071,4.2323,0.5893,0.0036,3.3426,0.9682,0.0003,1.5282,0.0216,3.3662,1.5569,5.3962,2.2361,4.8389,2.4342,0.2132,1.1854,2.0122,0.1152,0.9774,0.0011,0.9473,0.6643,3.9863,1.3887,6.1125,0.4613,0.0781,0.5877,0.1568,5.7364,6.3488,0.0739,0.002,0.0095,1.3534,4.6751,2.5509,0.7224,4.5043,3.7349,0.0146,0.2081,6.5127,4.6932,0.3786,0.7515,0.4517,4.7199,4.2748,0.0021,5.1413,1.705,8.6958,0.0024,2.3795,4.1255,4.5405,2.4701,4.327,1.7947,3.4136,0.0547,5.7482,0.9921,2.8545,5.8768,1.9508,2.9733,0.9806,3.2837,1.7168,7.3062,6.0036,1.1486,3.5704,0.3538,0.0051,0.9214,3.5551,0.4682,0.6248,0.0002,1.0971,0.0232,5.215,4.8446,5.7387,1.7619,1.0716,2.894,3.8994,0.2935,0.0036,0.2126,0.1684,0.0021,0.0029,0.001,0.0369,3.7262,0.5057,6.1909,0.6719,0.6292,2.3187,3.8153,2.4741,0.2409,3.7325,0.0095,2.2525,2.1998,0.367,2.3527,1.4873,0.9698,0.7266,5.9825,0.0884,2.1472,1.285,0.0002,10.3533,8.9671,7.2124,12.4068,8.4692,1.9906,7.673,0.9211,0.8561,3.6506,8.7246,3.2108,9.0235,6.0794,2.0158,2.1183,5.4737,4.161,0.7863,3.0189,4.0294,1.2555,2.7062,1.2209,0.4649,4.6357,4.131,3.6854,6.8844,6.9698,7.3986,6.3415,0.3373,4.6146,2.8088,7.2567,0.0118,0.6395,3.1479,3.4703,9.961,0.657,2.3505,0.4407,0.3304,0.6852,0.0002,1.0163,0.9601,2.6395,1.8864,1.958,6.4771,2.315,3.7694,3.042,1.7964,4.923,3.732,1.2064,4.6476,6.3145,1.9641,0.9042,2.3425,2.4584,1.2059,1.9352,0.1809,0.7596,3.9153,0.9301,2.6806,5.3203,4.4217,1.3962,2.3686,1.3023,4.0817,2.7577,1.0598,0.0758,0.0357,2.9612,2.9479,5.344,2.9878,5.5314,1.851,3.9269,1.1803,3.4313,6.655,2.3659,2.1986,2.7533,0.7347,7.4676,6.2461,5.9227,0.6355,4.3057,8.113,5.9271,8.3188,10.1868,0.1113,5.8006,1.2179,1.7962,3.515,3.8323,0.2844,0.9372,5.1895,0.8577,5.1038,1.9232,1.1035,1.1099,8.7673,1.9362,4.4577]}

{"id":490,"ended":true,"length":496,"text":"In 1985, Bedell put forward an agricultural plan that he thought would increase production controls for farmers, thus raising prices for crops. This plan, backed by labor unions and certain Democrats, succeeded, and the crop was turned into an agricultural production plan that was approved in 1986, and later signed by the president of the Mexican American Federation of Students (MAFOS).\n\nIn 1984 Bedell introduced a bill which allowed Mexican Americans to farm their own land for free, and the American farm workers to leave their jobs, and the Mexican farm workers to raise their own farm and sell the land to the Mexican farmers.\n\nOn March 20, 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed a comprehensive Mexican agricultural reform law, which was part of the Farm Bill that became law because farmers were forced to leave work to raise crops. After the reforms, Mexican farmers were forced to turn to a variety of methods of farming, a typical method of farming that they considered unsustainable, like planting in soil or soil water, and that would produce small or small amounts of greenhouse gas emissions, all of which increased their farm prices.\n\nIn 1988, the Mexican Agricultural Reform Party (FAP) had proposed that Mexican farmers, farmers and industry should stop selling their own land to the Mexican workers, and instead support the Mexican farms where native plants were harvested, and then export the plants back to their native soil. When their demands were met, the Mexican agricultural reform law was signed into law, and in 1987, the Mexican government introduced a law calling for \u201ca legal transition\u201d from Mexico\u2019s agriculture to Mexico\u2019s, similar to the policies championed at the beginning of the Mexican Revolution. Many Mexican farmers said the legal transition would allow them to start selling the lands of native plants, and in many cases, this would reduce their labor costs and increase their ability to raise their own land to grow the crops. These agricultural reform laws would also prevent the Mexican government from allowing foreign agribusiness to enter Mexico\u2019s agricultural development, and instead allow it to become part of a national industrial policy. The Mexican government introduced a Farm Bill in 1994, and in 2000, President Jimmy Carter signed it. In October 2007, Mexican President Sergio Moro signed a Farm Bill to abolish the federal agricultural law, and in August 2013 Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador signed an agreement with the U.S. with an agreement to establish a system to facilitate a transition from Mexico\u2019s current agricultural policies to the new agricultural ones after the American system ends, and thus in a way that can be negotiated.","token_len":525,"entropy":[9.8754,0.259,11.6857,3.3666,6.3171,4.2699,2.7941,8.6952,1.9633,1.2192,3.1205,3.3312,0.5995,5.3949,2.7032,12.9276,2.6533,3.6787,1.9853,5.0263,4.6262,1.941,1.3412,5.1979,0.8505,3.4876,1.4844,2.2461,6.5267,0.1262,6.0545,0.8212,1.3118,8.7009,6.2628,0.2396,4.7013,1.6716,1.6013,1.6547,4.8535,1.9938,5.5922,1.0049,3.0394,2.025,4.9132,5.2979,2.2929,2.6116,3.6192,1.7194,2.315,2.8773,2.0932,3.9533,5.9244,2.2425,2.2872,1.0458,1.6236,0.3167,6.5031,2.6645,2.2268,1.3427,7.3834,1.8417,3.6972,0.5784,6.7988,0.9798,0.8001,0.0023,2.0723,5.3179,4.5409,0.0106,3.4664,1.1758,2.6145,4.3868,4.6671,3.5135,2.2967,0.2917,5.0985,1.9843,0.6135,1.2289,2.4916,2.586,1.393,1.8169,3.2078,4.0014,4.8639,3.9494,4.781,5.3388,0.9765,2.5959,3.2506,1.7661,2.614,1.9289,4.217,0.6372,1.5302,5.4335,0.7352,0.3394,5.0683,4.2562,2.444,3.2919,0.4701,1.1983,1.6975,2.4591,3.1814,0.539,1.7658,0.0002,4.5058,2.5355,3.2443,0.0946,2.7111,0.1987,2.4346,2.347,0.0117,0.3708,2.2213,5.5676,5.3525,2.2528,1.721,1.6068,1.1364,1.3256,2.69,5.0485,0.0316,0.6302,6.4409,0.0614,3.467,3.1377,0.5628,8.2413,6.0466,1.799,2.503,0.0879,3.345,5.4642,2.5176,2.4195,2.8034,1.0786,4.8377,1.4657,5.2077,1.6931,2.7872,1.6776,1.856,1.2251,0.0579,4.579,1.6229,4.1081,2.9155,0.0032,2.6205,1.2879,1.2903,0.912,6.0184,7.6285,1.4577,0.8941,1.6156,1.7528,4.3871,3.7956,3.3539,2.0986,3.8702,4.0931,3.7883,5.7368,2.3781,5.2494,6.4358,1.5043,2.0547,4.852,3.6659,4.2246,5.3283,5.6492,3.6545,0.7824,0.0101,5.3362,1.3835,1.2094,2.1545,4.0923,0.5564,0.0173,5.3079,3.2353,4.73,2.7655,0.5067,0.6518,0.0002,1.8594,2.7753,0.3012,1.56,1.9555,3.385,1.4656,6.4037,0.6492,4.8286,2.6313,0.9273,5.0462,5.6473,2.284,2.0755,0.9619,3.3702,4.7913,2.3586,6.0366,2.8073,5.4933,3.2973,0.6594,4.0935,0.1998,0.8715,1.2488,0.9966,4.6545,1.0551,0.7414,2.1903,5.9197,1.4932,1.1792,5.2749,5.9307,7.5759,4.0131,1.3268,3.9708,1.7437,1.6381,4.2564,3.6306,1.3427,3.8167,3.2262,0.0721,2.9129,2.4726,4.0906,0.5706,5.7369,6.1093,4.5551,0.5424,0.6954,0.2237,0.9864,1.3572,2.9719,0.2196,3.233,0.9412,1.4565,1.3482,0.0017,1.4603,0.5,3.2424,3.8853,0.9061,1.1114,1.4884,2.2855,4.1919,0.9169,2.4214,5.2824,0.0801,16.1755,7.4991,2.835,5.5321,5.9034,6.8493,6.3134,2.2836,5.1767,11.3739,7.9539,3.4738,3.0588,0.4136,4.2019,1.6578,0.1727,0.1988,5.6361,6.6057,0.0443,0.8052,6.6195,6.0688,5.791,0.1988,2.9107,0.0154,0.3154,3.1267,1.5419,0.5512,6.7903,1.5417,0.7437,5.6282,2.7437,4.7987,0.2077,1.4109,2.9497,0.2758,0.0452,4.5296,2.4877,3.7583,3.7538,3.7231,5.0319,1.0262,1.2412,1.0539,3.7223,3.6785,0.2111,0.8305,3.8694,1.1572,3.8475,1.1076,4.364,0.1522,1.5751,2.0481,0.6824,4.7512,0.0105,2.4712,0.9557,0.3611,2.1363,3.9125,3.5388,3.3428,0.8609,1.7563,5.1663,3.7983,1.144,1.5253,3.8622,1.7139,4.3111,1.3643,1.3087,1.1249,0.0655,4.4046,3.5169,4.4253,0.1967,0.0009,0.0001,1.2866,4.3267,2.1396,4.2845,0.0502,0.1408,0.9636,4.9644,1.8224,1.365,5.5732,2.0393,2.7883,0.0592,4.6314,3.3061,0.004,2.982,3.033,5.4197,3.69,0.9432,3.2953,1.6096,0.7475,5.2906,1.1718,8.9552,0.2101,1.272,3.7264,1.0519,1.4593,1.2119,3.2528,0.5682,2.9299,3.4613,0.0144,0.3081,1.6684,2.7742,2.6006,4.7304,4.643,0.0578,3.4254,1.3415,6.5553,4.3592,0.7947,0.7461,1.0136,4.0215,0.0874,2.9244,5.3281,0.8497,4.7383,2.9737,3.3814,0.8955,1.111,0.7911,3.0008,3.7479,4.4184,0.3848,5.7406,0.7041,0.0126,0.5592,2.609,0.0656,0.0,1.4377,0.1075,0.0062,0.7323,2.7618,2.3911,0.5553,0.478,2.1353,0.0027,0.0273,0.1196,6.3566,3.1768,1.3802,0.8311,3.4501,0.6804,4.5102,2.5269,4.5723,3.622,2.7226,1.7177,2.6461,1.3011,0.0177,0.0216,5.8692,0.3554,2.9926,0.2427,1.6697,1.8065,1.4058,6.1303,7.5011,1.137,4.9648,5.4709,4.3435,2.6786,1.2794,5.6797,5.1935,3.1518,1.6804,0.2049,4.6753,0.8876,4.7866,2.7333]}

It will host the third round of Vettel-Raikkonen's Formula 1 championship since he left Ferrari four years ago.\n\nThe report, published on the official Facebook page of the Brazilian Grand Prix, was first reported by Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.\n\nThe Brazilian journalist and commentator, who was involved in one of the early negotiations between two parties for the race's rights due by the end of July, immediately tweeted:\n\n\"It was a great race as usual last year to see how Sebastian Vettel would be at Ferrari and to talk about how much we need to change a situation in race cars.\n\n\"Ferrari and Mercedes were the first two teams that went in against Ferrari, both of whom refused to play any more games in the future.\n\n\"It was a great event in a historic race atmosphere, it had some great points for everyone.

The other six lanes are to remain open until the US 12 southbound is reopened.\nAccording to the report, the I \/ 1 southbound is being reopened with the remaining areas being closed for the next five months due to the construction. The I \/ 11 southbound will remain open with the exception of the part of SR 835 that will have to be closed to traffic in order to close SR 835.\n\nThe complete closure means that one of the U.S. 52 northbound lanes as well as the US 12 southbound would be closed as well.\nIn January 1959, the USTR announced that northbound I \/ 3 southbound lanes and southbound I \/ 5 southbound lanes could be closed until the I \/ 12 southbound was reopened to traffic in order to complete both the I & 8 (SR 835) and I \/ 19 southbound lanes.\nIn February 1959, the USTR announced that the northbound I \/ 28 southbound had been closed to traffic until the I \/ 14 northbound was reopened.\n\nIn March 1959 the USTR announced that all southbound I \/ 5 southbound lanes and I \/ 17 eastbound lanes could be closed until it was possible to complete both the I & 8 and I \/ 5 southbound lanes.\nIn June 1959 the Northbound northbound remained closed. In October 1959 the northbound southbound lanes remained closed.\nIn November 1958 the USTR reported that the northbound southbound was closed due to \u201ccrisis\u201d caused by the completion of the section 1 southbound line on March 28 and 6, and a crash caused by a truck on the road leading to the southern part of the highway. This may have involved a power line and\/or a tire.","token_len":526,"entropy":[8.0514,8.4122,0.2174,8.1666,3.9971,0.7552,11.7247,0.189,7.5931,9.2028,3.2039,2.4653,13.7238,2.7142,3.2698,9.9236,7.6905,4.4567,11.438,5.3165,6.4793,6.3686,1.6129,1.6859,1.0536,0.2637,6.0196,1.9407,8.5234,13.6258,5.3463,5.7584,10.0454,2.8387,1.799,8.2108,4.5094,1.6636,3.6239,5.5004,1.4374,5.6462,4.7582,1.0475,5.3682,0.7811,5.0693,2.0366,1.0053,3.342,6.5415,8.6777,7.703,0.8994,2.8985,3.2241,7.119,2.3492,1.1473,1.2574,2.234,1.0877,4.8097,5.5182,0.8791,1.3398,8.7174,3.8247,4.0648,3.0225,0.7415,4.357,4.7962,3.6259,2.6152,4.3989,4.3483,1.7733,5.7793,0.1596,0.01,0.1413,3.8732,6.4788,3.6484,6.1108,4.75,4.0365,1.93,5.816,0.2721,2.8435,0.9139,2.7527,3.2767,1.2869,0.1452,6.2237,5.7422,4.6726,6.6036,0.0389,2.5662,0.5273,1.1481,4.5304,4.5942,1.2143,3.2412,2.7305,0.33,4.7269,1.1146,4.0699,0.8577,7.4394,0.3244,3.0401,6.4551,1.0965,2.4887,1.2578,2.6262,0.0218,2.5309,3.9063,6.0108,1.2734,0.7786,5.0392,0.0079,1.2342,2.1201,4.0443,0.675,1.127,4.7865,1.6008,0.3785,3.8115,0.6902,3.8146,0.0358,0.8582,3.8597,1.795,0.2838,8.3215,5.1751,3.0627,0.2849,4.9057,4.709,7.6667,2.4941,1.3838,0.5513,2.1415,0.0138,1.7404,3.6889,0.7846,1.9081,5.0053,5.3255,0.129,0.3186,5.9392,1.5458,2.3947,5.6151,5.813,1.5176,2.8669,2.2685,1.4288,0.2534,1.1695,1.6852,1.614,0.4657,0.6483,0.0089,1.5682,1.1462,0.5185,0.4134,3.8763,0.0029,0.7298,5.3711,0.5605,1.018,3.5001,5.0033,6.0492,3.4002,0.0578,3.2273,3.6354,2.5286,3.4783,1.1831,3.8946,5.8486,2.7393,1.9922,2.6649,1.6483,2.8033,2.9795,3.3819,4.1475,0.0155,1.7095,4.0772,4.1429,2.1578,2.0704,0.2182,7.6469,0.6944,0.0027,1.9658,1.9998,0.3541,4.1486,0.3126,5.8329,0.0334,0.7314,6.3583,0.3205,8.0005,3.5365,4.8014,1.3532,2.6062,3.7553,0.3085,0.1396,0.8549,2.637,3.8087,3.0588,1.9604,0.1109,5.2884,2.6942,0.2795,0.1545,0.8125,0.5128,7.8783,1.5969,7.4175,1.6073,7.2467,0.2537,5.426,2.0624,0.2148,6.2894,0.0667,0.0014,0.1082,6.7938,2.7273,0.0438,0.1703,6.5053,0.6534,0.0102,0.7519,2.6942,1.0893,0.4558,0.0017,4.5895,1.0369,0.5148,3.6472,0.4012,0.5692,0.6946,12.4614,3.248,0.98,0.1432,0.9337,1.2229,1.1264,1.2988,0.1722,7.2967,0.0117,2.0592,0.6186,3.6473,1.337,0.0349,1.0614,3.9509,1.5223,0.0016,0.1634,0.0371,2.2289,0.4345,0.0007,0.5874,3.9965,0.58,1.4548,3.2041,1.1955,2.5626,0.0918,3.4002,0.3346,0.0192,1.0768,0.7038,3.9599,0.4099,1.9166,0.2817,0.0317,4.8424,5.8797,1.4429,1.5917,3.0565,4.4491,6.4421,2.7784,0.23,0.1133,0.6087,0.8077,1.2323,0.5099,4.5873,1.9438,0.0452,0.6146,0.6374,0.433,10.9976,2.3067,0.1265,0.0653,0.6657,0.5828,0.0441,0.4122,0.1096,1.0824,2.4778,0.0215,1.1868,0.1569,7.3857,0.3369,0.0052,4.7954,0.7517,1.0718,2.8446,0.0855,2.2195,0.7338,0.9166,0.0752,3.5467,2.5037,0.0009,0.6254,0.4041,1.3095,0.4771,0.0006,0.9255,1.9881,0.1013,3.7772,0.435,0.015,0.3298,0.0826,3.4389,1.9569,0.0073,1.2171,0.1699,3.1741,0.4751,0.0044,0.2732,2.1779,2.7619,0.0628,3.7977,4.3259,0.0013,0.2284,2.09,0.1524,0.3524,0.4011,5.9454,0.2769,4.7927,0.1259,1.1655,1.1241,0.437,0.253,0.2111,3.0947,2.32,0.3318,0.1241,4.7425,0.7232,0.0133,0.1339,0.3726,0.2538,15.7214,2.3852,0.0841,1.9613,5.5875,2.0241,5.7833,0.0187,6.766,1.5946,3.4087,2.9408,3.0216,0.2514,1.2561,3.233,0.0061,2.7075,0.0133,3.179,4.0887,0.4907,1.1352,0.5703,13.9627,1.3255,3.3965,0.9334,0.9735,0.0208,4.711,0.1676,1.0151,1.7428,0.0168,2.9117,0.0278,2.265,1.84,3.3291,0.0036,16.507,6.8375,6.2326,3.6317,1.5813,6.5651,3.9114,0.0329,1.171,5.4866,0.0191,0.8504,7.5059,6.9757,2.2843,0.2126,5.719,3.5807,6.667,3.5051,4.4783,8.6917,1.128,2.8611,4.2116,6.4805,3.2268,0.3165,1.8682,3.5918,2.1209,1.0278,4.67,3.6624,0.794,0.6531,5.3128,3.0162,0.0174,0.635,3.7017,0.7462,4.2739,6.0208,0.4744,5.0239,1.1055,5.2914,2.1869,3.3739,3.7444,0.0006,1.4444,6.2828,2.058]}
{"id":648,"ended":true,"length":473,"text":"Several of Kilmer's poems, including `` Trees ``, were set to music and published in England by Kilmer's mother, Annie Kilburn Kilmer, who was a writer and amateur composer, and her book The Music of Kilmer. Kilmer wrote much about life and death, including a letter she wrote to Father Jim Karmon, who taught her to sing.\n\n''I was told that there was no chance for Kilmer to sing. For years I have felt the pressure to sing for Father Karmon, and she insisted on this,' she says. 'Then she became a master and I started playing. She had one last performance when we played two songs from one of her songs. One had never been heard before that time. It was very moving... She knew how to read to children. I could not make it at home and she told me that she had done it with a little help from the music teacher we had worked together.'\n\nDuring the '70s Kilmer was in Birmingham, England where she met John Kilmer, who later married her wife and had an eight-year-old son.\n\nWhen Kilmer had first visited England in the early 80s, Kilmer was living in a mansion with her husband and two children.\n\n''It is a very special place for her to be in,'' she says. 'I would not have heard anything before that.\n\n''And there is a huge story that she tells of when she was a child of four who got married and had a kid, only nine months old, and then when John Kilmer had to go to school for the next three years and the baby was born, the man who went to church that afternoon and the baby was born and the mother died.\n\n''And she said that it was too soon and she could have just lost her baby, and then she said that she would not talk.'\n\nKilmer died in 1995 at age 68.\n\nBuckingham Palace is one of many buildings still under construction near the grounds marking the 50th anniversary of Kilmer's first poem, ''Trees''.\n\nA new set of works are still on exhibit at the Royal Library of Scotland.\n\nNew works by Kilmer, including ''Trees'' and ''In the Moonlight '', are on display in an exhibition on Saturday.\n\nThey include ''Trees'' at the Royal Museums, including ''The Sunburn''.

{"id":3120,"ended":true,"length":509,"text":"Turner has sometimes referred to herself a Buddhist @ - @ Baptist, alluding to her upbringing in the Baptist church and her later conversion to Buddhism. Throughout her childhood and early adulthood, Turner has been drawn into the biblically correct form of Buddhism, which she said, she didn't see as a good thing. She found it attractive in contrast to the more traditional form of Christianity \"I really have a feeling of respect for people who are born outside the traditional way of living. And because of that, it's very much something that I don't find very attractive... and I don't find very attractive.\" In terms of her upbringing, Turner admitted, her parents didn't let her go to church because they felt like doing so would have had her in her own way.\n\nTurner says she never saw any reason for her to be religious or Catholic, but felt that she had to be secular to \"believe in that.\" She also said that even in Christianity, the Bible is \"the only book in existence\" and that she was a \"troubled person. I also believed that the Bible was a teaching with a place where you could talk or read and learn what you want to and to teach in the gospel and in the gospel of Jesus Christ without God\".\n\nTurner says that she is a \"devout\" Christian because she believes in Jesus Christ and Jesus IS the Lord. She also says that her church is \"no other sect than Christian\". To this end, she said: \"Christians are different from Christianity, but also different from the other religions. My church is just like the churches I went and I grew up in, and the churches the ones I went to were all in the Bible. I don't believe in the Bible. I believe in God. I don't believe in the Bible being this mysterious thing.\"\n\nShe says that she believes that God created all the animals on earth to have fertility. However, she believes that God created the creatures of the earth to be children of God.\n\nShe explained that her religious faith did not define who she was or who she thought she should be. She said that in the Bible she \"wanted to be who she felt she could be.

He did not see any opportunity to join the military until he was 24, when he enlisted in the Italian army and served in 1831 in the Italian First Battalions. He was also granted a master and five years of military training. That same year, he completed two years' training at St. Marys Catholic Church, but the teacher who had the education of Domitian refused to allow him to read to him.\n\nSince then, his mother was no longer involved in Domitian's studies. \"He remained a teacher for a time, but I did not let him leave the house because I was afraid that he might use that power,\" she said.\n\nA day before he turned 16, he enlisted in the Italian army. At 21, he had joined his mother in the same rank. His father, who was in love with Domitian, had joined the military. Soon after the war, he went to Rome to study in the college of Theologia, where he graduated in August 1635. At the end of his second year in the army, he entered the army and served in the infantry. Finally, he joined the Italian militia of the time, where he served during the reign of Pope Clement XI and lasted until 1638.\n\nWhen the pope withdrew from the Roman Republic in 1714, he resumed the administration of the Roman Church in Rome.\n\nHe was appointed by Pope Francis to the office of cardinal in 1653 to act as secretary under his predecessors. After the separation, Domitian died. He was buried at the monastery of Treviso with the remains of the father, his brothers, and a small garden. His widow and daughters lived in his chapel alongside their husband.\n\nThe post-Catican period marked Domitian's return to the Roman Republic with the departure of his brother, who took over the church. However, he maintained office in an Italian Catholic Catholic Church, which was abolished in 1997.\n\nAt least 1,600 Roman Catholic churches are now open in Italy, including those in Treviso, which consists mainly of basilica churches. Domitian and his wife died in a car accident in December 1998.","token_len":527,"entropy":[2.6862,1.784,2.7137,1.7196,6.1995,1.2763,0.0094,0.141,9.308,4.8297,1.8213,3.1796,2.5258,3.5244,2.3691,1.5353,7.4275,1.3864,2.7743,1.6137,4.2678,0.7819,0.5342,2.1552,1.939,1.1631,9.0998,6.4339,0.3438,0.8256,5.3129,2.3323,2.3261,7.0546,4.1893,2.0132,3.0675,0.9681,4.3535,2.101,2.6411,0.032,0.0045,5.7048,5.1865,4.8344,1.6207,0.0123,2.493,3.834,2.4688,4.1466,2.8819,1.6184,3.493,4.1195,4.9665,0.203,0.9266,7.3818,4.0788,4.4298,6.3716,0.9839,0.0017,0.0036,0.2293,2.9124,4.745,6.6545,4.5821,1.0463,0.6371,0.7801,1.0693,4.8059,3.2267,0.4134,0.0179,0.306,2.092,5.357,0.2559,4.5814,2.7296,5.6407,0.604,3.7291,0.4102,2.4734,1.7788,1.1114,0.306,5.8434,1.2324,0.6828,0.4011,2.9014,1.0663,0.4885,4.083,0.5995,2.2229,3.4334,1.7475,6.1169,4.5394,4.0699,0.9174,3.1411,6.1075,4.3821,0.8528,0.4619,1.8243,1.3478,3.207,6.1531,1.4099,5.5844,7.0981,6.825,1.0123,0.7808,2.307,1.003,1.7725,6.205,1.3552,0.0164,0.1753,1.1593,4.8728,4.0823,0.7594,2.3801,1.8189,1.6575,4.2243,0.2418,4.3039,4.7353,4.3136,1.2768,1.2541,4.1515,3.2641,7.7066,3.1047,2.759,6.4675,5.7555,2.7645,1.9052,0.0016,0.0059,4.6805,0.2783,2.0157,0.1678,0.1103,5.9744,3.5748,0.309,0.7749,1.2695,0.0002,5.815,0.7758,0.0921,3.253,2.8552,3.8214,5.1764,0.1377,5.185,0.3318,3.6792,0.0007,0.002,0.056,4.6868,1.1805,4.4236,2.2722,5.543,2.2827,4.5586,2.5648,1.7472,2.6747,0.9951,0.7036,3.392,2.9321,0.0586,4.1272,0.2149,3.9136,1.6768,1.8581,3.2627,1.1733,2.1529,0.9521,1.1339,0.8035,1.2441,5.1832,3.7333,3.268,3.0601,1.7344,1.0399,0.2722,0.9859,0.0002,3.9843,5.703,1.8563,1.564,3.7372,2.0858,0.1473,2.3404,4.0342,0.5664,0.1483,1.6167,2.0764,1.7172,3.7227,6.6789,0.2974,0.3865,3.6283,3.6311,4.0841,2.4762,2.7684,1.3316,5.5884,5.1839,3.2641,3.406,0.9795,1.3635,1.3683,1.0741,2.8319,6.963,0.0516,1.2397,0.0003,0.0022,0.4983,2.2119,4.0048,0.6223,2.9022,2.3815,5.7567,0.5854,3.27,1.7341,0.6024,1.2307,3.9024,0.4206,1.9031,1.1308,2.1534,2.6359,0.7356,4.7054,1.1126,5.0037,2.9242,2.237,1.977,1.573,0.2358,3.8134,0.8469,4.7671,1.4139,3.5568,0.3714,3.6393,1.063,1.9011,0.0022,0.8433,2.7415,0.2034,2.628,1.0667,0.6446,0.0852,0.3046,4.1023,0.588,2.5176,1.9602,2.9528,1.3041,1.1682,4.5566,0.9787,6.3089,0.0667,1.2354,2.5435,0.2149,2.3927,4.5622,3.5717,1.7228,5.8752,0.5603,3.9096,0.1343,3.1218,4.7312,0.2055,4.6978,0.0543,3.3342,3.5626,3.8868,2.5637,5.2856,1.0649,2.3296,2.8454,0.2875,0.4899,0.0001,3.2694,2.404,5.1061,8.0797,0.8011,1.1875,3.2799,4.8514,0.8344,3.1699,2.8668,0.0946,1.0769,7.3509,2.272,6.9698,0.182,0.2666,2.2608,3.7007,2.6591,0.8413,0.6251,3.3566,0.0002,2.8639,1.5898,2.5953,2.8572,0.9467,4.2835,1.1322,1.0938,3.7056,0.0852,4.7738,1.8234,2.9959,4.2438,6.6455,4.5689,0.1414,5.1034,6.025,3.1179,5.0489,1.2731,3.433,1.7112,5.8851,1.6293,3.3011,0.0005,0.0016,6.1568,2.888,1.9308,0.8715,0.8171,1.5015,1.3003,4.4075,0.2479,7.2658,1.8569,0.0683,6.0282,1.6935,4.2365,0.0123,2.5543,5.5292,1.7274,2.7868,2.6594,0.6275,0.5867,3.0339,3.3104,7.3173,0.8193,2.8699,4.0463,3.1831,4.4028,3.3625,0.6289,3.4583,4.9311,6.6502,3.8152,4.7119,0.8742,0.5513,0.0002,2.5405,6.31,2.9201,4.5047,10.3179,4.7278,3.9702,2.206,0.001,0.0014,0.0204,1.9355,0.0867,1.2779,1.2582,2.9814,4.2286,1.4959,5.3903,0.0285,1.1789,2.5525,0.7268,2.2874,4.0044,1.0328,0.9129,5.6176,1.6255,4.2059,0.0062,1.7756,5.0608,8.0572,2.0515,4.2973,4.6612,4.3752,6.6526,4.097,1.9616,2.0131,1.5833,4.7028,0.4664,5.5492,0.4474,0.8347,0.0002,4.926,4.075,5.2364,0.0979,3.4275,2.5008,1.174,4.2673,2.5099,3.0769,3.4684,1.7401,2.0058,0.9026,2.8088,3.2328,1.3652,4.9489,0.0026,0.001,0.9684,3.1418,6.4541,3.8344,0.0014,5.9721,1.6746,2.109,1.0952,3.516,0.0012,0.0054,4.3943,0.1368,1.2604,5.2453,0.6379,2.9882,1.5337,0.366,0.7779,4.2915,5.4601,0.591]}

He recognised a shift in the global market for stylists, as consumers saw fashion as a 'game-changer' and started to get more creative while using stylists who had no time to'make their own decisions', \"and now have a new generation of stylists who can tell the difference between beauty and art styles\", Everest says.\n\n\"I have been working closely with my friends and colleagues on numerous television programs, books, films and blogs for 25 years or so. I have been recognised as one of the top fashion stylists in Britain, and I have been recognised as a champion for stylists in the UK, particularly in advertising and promotional campaigns. I also have the most experience working with British brand partners. I take creative leadership at all levels, and I know I have a fantastic team of stylists of all types. I look forward to working with many of the other amazing fashion stylists working towards their passion at home.\"\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nMTV was the first to offer a subscription model exclusively to 'high quality' television and films, and the network went on to publish television shows on various formats. The network made many of the brand's classic films and television series available as well as the hit musicals about the British aristocracy, including 'Big Foot', 'The Duke of Gwynedd', and 'The Mummy'.\n\nWhile Everest claims he has managed to sell his product over the past year, he is still taking orders in the next few weeks for orders on behalf of his brand, with orders expected to be taken by the end of January. However, he added: \"I have been making things as simple as possible, so I guess I am quite happy to pay for it myself at this level, and although I haven't been able to sell a product properly or keep up with demand, I can very well take it in a few weeks!\"","token_len":527,"entropy":[9.1929,8.3924,4.9502,1.9655,3.7946,1.9848,5.8443,2.3755,0.0694,3.9762,2.8461,1.1026,5.1177,7.7023,0.0033,2.6371,10.7198,4.1716,0.4697,9.4013,3.1464,3.5486,0.7925,11.7,4.4575,8.4719,8.0024,1.5303,6.4335,3.2412,4.8405,0.0033,6.2413,2.0343,2.5712,1.6936,10.5472,3.4469,6.7289,0.1886,1.1242,6.1184,3.2035,1.338,5.3031,0.6795,1.3895,3.7266,6.12,4.3577,4.7805,0.9962,1.2434,5.3325,5.1906,2.9034,0.3549,0.002,0.8663,0.9404,4.6283,1.4818,5.4485,3.0787,2.3057,5.3028,4.4445,6.4625,0.5162,3.6584,2.369,3.3584,4.3831,1.4646,12.3164,5.9479,2.9826,1.9697,9.2312,10.8554,7.2959,3.0572,4.2119,4.0342,1.5147,3.8973,3.5323,0.2071,2.7618,0.0276,1.9409,2.0852,4.8085,1.5079,0.7,0.107,4.6731,0.1111,3.3624,6.7648,1.6884,3.6212,1.7853,0.0959,0.4889,0.0005,5.0364,0.0809,0.3558,0.0049,0.002,0.179,0.0197,0.0827,0.0162,0.0004,0.0095,0.0007,0.0025,0.0068,0.0008,0.0012,0.0064,0.0411,0.0027,0.0143,0.0185,0.0148,0.0022,0.0386,0.0143,0.165,0.0114,0.0008,0.002,0.0008,0.0036,0.005,0.0015,0.0021,0.0014,0.0173,0.2629,0.014,0.0016,0.0067,0.0008,0.0014,0.0064,0.0012,0.0008,0.0011,0.0002,0.001,0.0012,0.0012,0.0132,0.005,0.0006,0.0016,0.0023,0.0007,0.001,0.0007,0.0083,0.0064,0.0002,0.0049,0.0019,0.0016,0.0007,0.0015,0.0027,0.0015,0.0059,0.0004,0.0013,0.0027,0.0011,0.002,0.0041,0.0381,0.0025,0.0018,0.0002,0.005,0.5034,0.2834,0.0019,0.0002,0.0009,0.0015,0.0008,0.0004,0.0007,0.0021,0.0005,0.0011,0.0016,0.0024,0.0009,0.0025,0.0039,0.0022,0.0004,0.0014,0.0024,1.2388,0.0045,0.0379,0.0094,0.767,0.0001,2.0513,1.8828,3.2648,2.3206,2.714,5.0513,0.0185,3.3397,3.1448,1.2137,1.4133,2.6235,6.9272,5.7227,3.5634,1.5473,5.8761,0.7557,2.074,0.5644,4.7244,2.7456,5.7014,0.1729,6.2731,0.7523,1.1973,1.2718,1.2928,2.1148,6.86,1.3165,1.0878,0.0191,0.1168,2.682,4.1257,2.5422,0.0025,0.4936,4.426,1.6386,1.3484,1.5449,1.6269,1.7788,2.9022,0.6498,1.6372,5.0567,2.4786,4.8361,0.7415,1.5718,1.3484,1.0285,2.1583,4.9854,1.0342,5.0796,1.4575,5.592,2.3181,1.1029,1.18,3.8652,1.282,3.4247,4.7728,3.3289,1.7213,0.5698,5.63,5.0133,5.3924,2.5985,1.1903,5.813,6.2901,4.4531,3.8674,2.5542,1.1825,1.7193,1.1852,1.1585,3.2085,3.0884,1.4749,1.6084,5.134,1.2356,1.309,1.9102,0.006,6.0123,0.7838,3.1366,2.3128,1.2329,3.568,0.1735,0.0031,0.7791,0.1507,4.5917,0.5502,1.6388,5.0215,5.4973,2.5635,1.3358,0.0027,2.8497,6.9213,2.9151,6.4246,6.0189,5.1805,2.1376,0.1667,0.0002,5.1581,4.0508,0.0035,0.1574,0.0002,4.2827,1.8326,4.4575,2.5338,0.5225,1.5625,3.2744,2.0815,4.664,2.5183,8.1926,0.5149,6.0391,4.8129,2.6495,0.4754,4.108,2.6273,5.0134,1.1688,1.433,2.9165,4.3155,5.1262,1.1007,0.0334,6.015,5.96,1.9504,4.1745,5.3451,2.5759,1.7474,2.4818,2.9744,5.4188,4.5585,2.4822,1.4638,6.2405,0.213,5.8226,3.9692,1.7678,1.6684,1.2162,0.6582,3.9066,2.548,0.7677,2.9727,5.8753,5.3917,1.8371,6.6698,1.5213,4.2315,4.9119,1.4325,2.074,2.9752,5.966,6.0585,0.8813,0.5787,1.823,6.5523,1.2479,8.9682,6.7848,0.31,0.5912,1.6065,0.7156,1.4306,5.706,0.8532,0.4649,1.1101,0.0002,4.9404,1.1058,5.3459,1.7255,1.3729,5.9986,0.1625,5.1081,2.3646,5.3062,4.4189,1.2823,1.7596,3.3926,0.5871,1.1345,2.3047,1.9892,5.359,3.6683,4.0081,1.7018,6.4368,1.0389,0.9129,1.8999,7.4459,3.82,6.0981,0.0075,1.4835,3.2938,1.7571,3.5307,3.0114,2.2717,0.6357,1.1316,5.511,1.6038,1.0907,0.165,0.0004,3.4664,0.2221,5.4323,0.0759,1.4547,5.0257,0.8986,0.097,1.085,1.8798,1.7552,4.2132,6.3437,4.4128,3.6856,0.2148,0.7789,1.6855,2.6998,1.0209,6.2342,1.0969,2.4955,4.7953,1.8772,1.6014,6.7169,1.7677,2.0633,3.5443,5.7361,1.0918,6.4035,2.3474,1.8565,6.2511,0.5553,4.7592,0.0007,2.2232,1.0271,0.0031,2.6183,3.0531,1.9623,8.2716,4.8487,6.1834,2.8307,0.3372,0.6466,0.5514,0.3505,3.1514,7.0902,1.2831,4.1632,2.5583,3.7634,3.1554,1.7095,0.7068,5.697]}
{"id":628,"ended":true,"length":464,"text":"The Virginia Tech Hokies, like Miami, entered the 1980 season after accumulating a 5 \u2013 6 record in 1979. Though the Hokies traveled far less than Miami, they also hoped to remain relevant at the same time. The Hokies, who had a 9-3 record, led the nation in scoring, while Miami finished at 23.4 points-per game.\n\nThey were also the only team to win the Atlantic 10 Conference Championship, defeating Rutgers 41-20 in the third round on a rainy, cloudy afternoon in April, the week before the NCAA Tournament. The Hokies, though, never trailed, and earned a 3-point lead early in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut the win by Virginia Tech meant that the Hokies had to defeat Penn and Michigan to be crowned as ACC champions. Despite this loss, the Buckeyes finished at 10-1 after a pair of upsets to the Sooners and Wolverines.\n\nThat said, there was no shortage of controversy surrounding the Hokies in the wake of both losses, which may have been more than just a coincidence.\n\nThe Hokies lost three of their final four matches to fall into seventh place in the ACC, while Penn failed to make the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2006.\n\nBoth teams have lost to the Sooners, but while Penn will be back in college action next year, their ACC home record is currently down to 5 \u2013 3.\n\nBoth teams' losses came on a rain-soaked day of competition at Virginia, which is far from ideal. Virginia Tech entered the game as the favorite to win the ACC Tournament, and yet the Hokies had a game against the Buckeyes to play. The Buckeyes finished at 7-1, and the Hokies lost.\n\nThe Hokies have had some success at home this season, so perhaps it was a coincidence that neither team was undefeated.\n\nThat said, Virginia finished with a conference record of 19-0, and the Hokies' record is at 24-0, meaning that it won just once in five matches.\n\nThe Hokies also lost four of their last five match in the same span, so this will be a tough start at Wake Forest. Like Miami, the Buckeyes are coming off a 2-1 showing in their first season in the ACC, and they will face a Wake Forest team ranked 1-6. The Cavaliers didn't make the NCAA Tournament because of the NCAA Tournament, but they didn't lose because their victory should have been much bigger than those losses in a previous trip to the tournament.","token_len":527,"entropy":[9.7183,2.4394,4.2968,0.0265,2.8247,6.8638,6.0907,0.8511,7.9818,0.6719,8.1782,1.6453,6.6485,8.4392,1.8314,5.1434,9.036,2.6888,0.4275,1.4759,6.5742,1.3593,5.7222,1.4784,1.0283,0.004,7.9217,5.7533,4.5968,1.237,3.6654,0.6724,0.7309,3.7055,9.2404,0.1422,5.0361,1.6788,3.4906,0.892,3.1847,0.3732,0.6651,2.4739,1.8668,0.0051,3.7354,1.485,1.7435,2.6517,4.5172,1.4153,2.368,0.1752,2.6337,4.8978,0.3878,1.0353,0.225,0.8636,2.4639,4.9992,1.7639,3.7513,4.6212,5.9511,3.0378,2.4675,0.2086,7.6043,0.0227,6.1867,0.4346,0.9586,0.0002,4.462,2.2935,2.3,2.3744,1.3685,0.3409,0.7526,2.0,1.7353,3.8404,2.0368,1.9149,2.2093,1.8907,4.4014,5.4225,5.3041,0.1285,2.9682,1.0186,1.0277,4.3435,1.0252,3.8925,3.6641,5.9413,2.6639,4.2712,2.6342,1.0068,4.4946,2.8748,4.0868,4.7908,0.599,0.736,3.0998,1.0844,0.4211,1.8407,1.8884,0.0048,2.7821,3.5908,0.1053,4.0633,3.2492,2.2766,1.3582,5.8931,0.9967,4.7703,0.8957,4.0694,1.6822,4.4388,0.1368,0.038,1.1528,0.1167,0.9678,1.3276,0.0002,3.5313,1.8494,4.8552,5.446,2.1834,0.1567,4.8379,1.4677,1.0049,0.791,0.0053,2.1408,1.2205,6.5152,5.5071,6.6355,3.6674,1.6102,3.7935,5.6335,5.0958,3.8571,0.7641,0.3899,5.3053,4.0732,3.5153,0.1255,0.746,5.3809,0.0022,3.7408,4.2213,3.6484,0.2239,2.1457,3.865,1.8064,5.0469,0.0469,4.7792,0.0021,2.5586,2.1394,4.1823,0.0003,1.3257,3.9721,0.0004,0.7708,0.8327,0.0002,4.353,4.9962,0.0047,3.7905,1.0153,1.8594,4.3242,0.007,4.8684,1.3584,0.49,2.691,0.0135,2.7207,0.5875,3.0209,0.0023,6.5684,1.7099,2.2302,2.3483,5.3299,0.3331,1.5157,3.3306,2.5284,1.3551,1.1691,2.5313,0.1658,1.0311,0.0001,2.1377,3.0146,0.0106,3.5979,3.5479,0.9838,0.4157,1.614,0.4592,5.8368,1.4328,6.5043,3.2432,7.2957,0.0772,0.9222,0.0641,1.9331,1.9454,3.3554,2.8381,7.8183,0.0348,1.7731,0.3756,1.5984,0.2372,2.1816,0.1143,0.7876,0.0078,0.9203,3.6583,0.3851,1.293,0.0002,4.9847,1.3989,3.3209,3.896,2.195,2.3614,5.9035,0.0022,1.7513,1.8674,5.8315,1.8712,5.4313,1.8185,4.2569,0.9205,4.455,3.657,1.9262,1.9582,0.2345,4.9928,6.382,4.9347,2.5957,1.1709,4.6373,4.3007,0.7987,3.4622,3.3617,2.3683,0.4353,0.6761,0.0002,3.9473,0.4796,4.9679,4.0281,2.1351,2.3613,2.6066,7.2536,0.4175,0.497,0.0004,2.302,5.0862,4.8546,2.7925,3.732,4.8987,2.0587,2.9983,5.5815,0.3535,2.8253,1.2283,3.4314,1.455,6.1988,0.3825,1.3849,3.385,1.0487,2.7237,0.6409,0.6107,0.473,0.8383,2.6312,0.6796,2.1391,5.7879,1.9028,0.8745,0.0028,3.4863,1.8499,4.2341,2.7174,1.8704,3.4181,0.0041,2.8756,4.7696,2.2264,2.4273,1.8915,0.0025,3.4421,2.8698,3.1082,1.5655,1.8933,1.5119,1.3983,1.9755,0.2724,0.0029,3.1372,3.6351,0.2806,0.0001,1.9546,1.7211,0.0071,2.7681,3.34,2.858,1.9633,2.5126,1.3051,2.573,0.3712,0.4107,5.2939,4.0099,2.0316,1.3822,2.317,2.1954,0.1991,5.2843,0.3231,2.1404,4.2889,1.0949,1.457,0.0002,4.49,0.8598,0.0033,2.9583,7.6122,1.9837,0.7282,6.9485,0.7564,0.3185,3.6762,0.5774,2.8514,1.3298,1.2394,1.7292,0.7463,0.0034,3.6558,2.0532,1.7929,3.8987,4.0186,0.6275,1.4538,1.6942,3.9611,0.9573,3.1783,4.2456,6.2079,2.5625,1.2523,4.214,3.876,0.7455,0.6823,0.0001,1.8681,1.2553,0.006,3.0347,2.4419,3.7214,0.3704,0.1452,0.6164,0.3127,6.0837,6.0521,1.1471,5.8346,5.1008,0.7269,3.8704,2.8883,4.4055,0.8382,1.2838,2.9925,6.005,5.6235,6.4769,0.047,0.418,7.1407,2.1917,0.1397,0.906,3.2448,0.0033,2.4478,3.5169,0.0166,0.7705,3.8965,0.878,1.1445,7.4837,1.5383,2.1538,2.4486,3.5051,1.3886,0.6049,0.4112,1.2341,0.8997,2.1269,2.3385,2.5205,1.6126,6.0062,0.0123,0.3487,4.11,5.3212,2.5578,2.8462,1.9006,3.341,6.1199,5.712,0.0006,2.6405,0.3633,0.8943,0.0764,5.3581,0.4962,2.7892,4.3184,0.8675,0.434,0.5894,1.1457,4.4261,0.0004,1.9938,0.9936,5.1789,5.8792,6.9267,0.5669,0.856,5.4435,4.3765,1.9076,5.653,0.5969,4.1769,4.5373,5.3542,5.9638,0.7,1.7253,4.3941,0.1408]}

Descartes freed plane curves from the Greek and Macedonian limitation to conic sections, and Newton followed his lead by classifying the cubic curves into categories, known as bibri.\n\nThe basic theory of geometry, based mainly on geometry by Newton, is that a two-dimensional section (or bibri) is an infinite space surrounded by four plane curves which give an infinite number of planes (i.e. the triangle), and a three-dimensional section, which is the triangular one. Descartes is believed to have inspired the development of Cartesian geometry through his discovery of geometry concepts related to two-dimensional planes. Descartes is credited with discovering Cartesian geometry by comparing the geometry of the triangle to the geometry of the normal line to give him the knowledge of the three-dimension geometry of a square. As the example here shows a typical Cartesian geometry.\n\nCav\u00e9res and his son John are the two founders of the philosophy that has been a part of the scientific literature since its creation. They also contributed to the development of various forms of mathematics and theory.\n\nReferences\n\nLiterature\n Descartes, M. W. (1873). Descartes: Philosophies (Berlin). A.H.\n Descartes, M. W.

One had some vocals from the song but there were also vocals and the vocals from the video. The song was co co co co #1 in the BDay Anthology Series. It turned out really well. #BDayX2 #BDay Anthology\n\n\"It is something I've felt for years in my life. It's really a very special time. I wanted everyone to come together and we've been really lucky in that regard because everybody knows each other and our project is really all about working together. So I'm really looking forward to being part of the B'Day Anthology project. And the title is just a lovely way to honor myself as a producer and artist. And we're all super excited to be working with Johnathan Jones and bring those out on this album...\n\n\"There's a lot of stuff that could be covered on this album. But this is a new title for the album and I think that's a really cool thing for us. It's been a long time in the making and it feels fresh, and it's just the right way to go about things. And it's gonna be this big thing so it's gonna be the perfect time to honor everyone. I think it'll be super awesome. And it's gonna be great. We definitely will be recording this for the B'Day Anthology project. I'm just really excited and very excited to be part of something so special and unique.\"\n\nThe song #BDayX2 was released as a single, with the music video accompanying it.

{"id":4173,"ended":true,"length":482,"text":"The Spring Garden Road Memorial Library was named after its status as a war memorial and displays several commemorative artefacts, including two Books of Remembrance containing the names of thousands of Halifax County residents who have been gunned down by police during the past month.\nIn a release released by the Library yesterday, the community will host a remembrance of these brave civilians on Monday, March 21 from 7pm through 10.30pm at Queen Mary University of Health and Environmental Sciences (QMUHS) on the street at the North Hall at the corner of North and St John streets.\nThis will be a community outreach to the Halifax community and to members of all communities who have contributed to the closure of the historic library by the Halifax Police. The library will also have an extensive list of events and activities for attendees as well as a list of people who have contributed to closing the historic library.\nLibrary members will have the chance to take part in a QUIZ on March 21 where they will see an interactive project by QMUHS and the Halifax community to support those impacted by the tragedy.\nIn addition, local residents can take part in a QUIZ on March 21 where participants or visitors will learn details of the QUIZ that will be held at the Library, with activities relating to the Halifax Police, which will feature items such as a T-shirt and hats.\nThe Halifax Police have been responsible for the closure of the historic library for 25 years. During that time, many members of the community have lost loved ones to violence. The library is also working to build connections throughout the Halifax community through community events and activities to support the library and the community.\nAs well as a QUIZ, the community also has a number of events happening tomorrow as participants or guests can view the Halifax Police's website to discover their local links for updates. Participants can join local groups like the Halifax Police's Stolen from Halifax Neighbours and Halifax Community Action group to register and support the library's services.\nThe free Halifax Town Hall for the Remembrance of the Soldiers and Men Killed in Operation Operation Freedom and the Remembrance of the War Victims and Women and Boys are scheduled for 10am.

After Alabama scored on its three-plus second possessions, Brice hit four of his next five three-pointers, including the game-winner, to seal the win.\nIt also kept Brice, the #1 receiver in the country, sidelined for the rest of the night due to a concussion \u2013 though not severe. Brice did not play much second-half, though, as he blocked Alabama's three-headed three, but he and five of his teammates contributed plenty of points. On defense, two players were also held to 14 points by the Gamecocks, including Brice, in the game's final quarter.\nOn defense, Alabama held opponents scoreless in the closing quarters on a combined 46 third quarter possessions. The Crimson Tide led by as much as 24 points on 25-24 shooting in the final quarter.\nIt felt like Brice had lost both of his skills in the game.\nIn the fourth quarter, his absence was felt by Alabama with just seven minutes left to go before halftime. Auburn's Tyler Matz and Alabama quarterback Nick Saban were playing on the sideline, respectively, and the rest of the Tigers got to enjoy a short, entertaining evening.\n\"I thought we showed up to play their game,\" LSU quarterback Justin Herbert said. \"They were super tough, and I know they wanted to score as many points as they could and it was just really special.\"\nWhat happened to LSU in the fourth quarter?\nWhile the Gamecocks did not commit any turnovers (they played nine minutes), LSU used 19 turnovers to get to the Alabama 38. The Tiger's offensive rating was the lowest since 2011.\nAuburn also went without a touchdown, while Auburn shot 53% from the field.\nAlabama went on to score on 10 of its first 14 drives, including 12 field goals. Auburn also got 16 points from Jordan Reed (nine field goals) and a touchdown from sophomore receiver KJ Carter (eight catches, 95 yards).\nAs expected, the Gators were in the game. They led 15-8 midway through the first quarter, and scored on 14 of their final 18 possessions. Alabama outscore the Tigers 38-16, and the game ended 33-33.\nIt was a night for Brice, Saban and Alabama again. He passed for 239 yards on 22 touchdowns and four interceptions, and the Tide was No. 1 in passing yards, while passing in a combined 22th consecutive year.","token_len":529,"entropy":[10.6473,1.486,5.5133,0.6177,0.0008,3.7697,7.5145,3.8762,3.6073,4.2641,0.0025,1.4791,3.218,1.5902,11.6169,9.8896,9.3375,1.8525,4.8571,5.9299,4.9904,6.6972,2.0098,1.3781,6.9393,0.3439,3.9951,0.0547,0.0002,4.7075,5.8632,3.4527,1.4759,4.7413,4.5029,3.491,3.0971,2.8596,5.7905,1.6313,7.5512,4.1167,6.0358,0.5724,1.1198,0.0014,4.2877,4.9063,2.2605,0.7037,3.2557,0.8212,2.7807,0.3154,0.5529,1.9516,1.4471,2.8808,1.8408,0.1926,0.6692,1.8301,0.8103,4.0341,0.3207,1.0253,0.4115,0.5706,14.8935,4.7934,5.781,2.5309,0.0003,4.6428,2.715,6.519,0.8055,5.8002,0.5095,0.2472,0.4642,0.7593,5.4666,1.0202,1.1891,1.0139,0.0007,0.0901,4.1008,4.1737,0.0136,0.6828,3.4392,5.2908,3.9605,4.1798,7.4066,1.0416,2.6079,0.0003,3.7744,1.1248,1.4268,5.3172,8.2995,1.3712,0.2683,1.4933,2.549,0.8792,1.5053,0.9671,8.6426,6.1141,0.1528,2.4422,1.0338,6.5406,4.6856,3.4884,3.8702,2.1494,4.7738,6.7863,2.8614,0.1674,1.0653,5.9573,6.1275,0.6757,1.3522,1.5054,5.3938,3.7443,0.0731,5.8435,3.4147,2.5177,4.8017,3.8482,0.8546,5.3739,0.2786,4.5794,2.413,3.0394,0.015,0.0013,1.1547,1.1974,3.8991,0.0003,1.1607,5.2068,0.8428,3.122,0.2354,1.3722,2.9056,0.2719,0.3427,4.2399,2.0353,0.0929,2.604,3.2095,5.1926,4.1246,0.0047,1.7745,0.7372,4.3466,6.0349,4.3871,2.6901,4.9452,5.182,5.1118,4.0197,1.6303,0.8451,2.1593,3.5196,0.002,2.4177,1.1202,0.928,1.7045,0.0035,3.9194,0.7785,2.1443,4.4131,2.2306,3.949,2.2975,1.8982,0.1971,1.072,1.5832,1.0596,0.554,3.9605,5.6177,0.4654,2.0696,0.0004,2.1372,4.4565,5.6486,1.5671,0.0374,7.8433,2.4124,0.5679,2.9783,1.1689,1.6816,4.3849,0.7501,3.1652,0.0304,0.1717,3.6331,5.7905,1.918,2.9674,2.494,3.1868,5.0389,3.9413,3.947,0.7927,0.7657,2.555,2.3198,3.9358,3.0693,0.3063,7.4959,1.7902,6.3826,5.9597,2.9517,3.5695,4.4046,4.681,3.5519,1.3583,2.2708,5.1003,2.8562,0.7584,1.8615,1.5977,2.2091,0.5464,2.1751,2.4369,4.8659,0.1055,0.0808,4.1691,4.4026,2.7297,7.1402,1.4409,5.1242,2.3166,6.6118,5.0974,1.214,0.4733,2.1715,1.5537,2.6515,1.3068,4.8348,2.6874,3.2838,1.4244,5.8542,0.9412,1.6354,5.14,4.1159,4.8253,3.1329,0.1622,0.6169,0.1447,2.5829,1.801,6.0506,4.5599,1.5777,1.569,1.9418,5.0176,1.3467,4.1754,0.4746,4.5615,4.6058,1.4215,0.2237,0.2223,0.7507,0.4306,3.463,3.6965,0.937,2.2914,3.4646,4.3071,1.6612,0.1202,6.0887,2.8902,2.651,4.3296,3.2487,0.2926,2.0704,0.1151,1.5306,0.8225,4.9642,1.5813,2.2473,0.006,0.006,3.7999,0.9291,6.0313,2.451,0.7666,3.5466,2.5536,5.0838,4.9279,3.7981,3.4091,3.2121,5.6295,5.9585,1.4173,2.7468,3.6557,1.8698,1.3164,8.1396,3.6585,1.2003,2.0467,4.9002,3.1621,3.845,4.9879,1.0907,3.0933,1.1233,3.5851,3.7271,1.6261,0.7836,4.4286,0.3634,0.0022,3.5248,3.8415,4.7149,0.9319,2.6206,2.6475,4.5163,3.3393,3.7153,4.2724,3.426,0.5538,0.1825,0.1274,1.4525,0.8975,2.6512,3.5862,1.8072,0.4858,3.0856,5.0955,4.2523,0.5304,1.5938,2.0793,2.4816,3.5399,1.0052,1.0066,3.9794,5.5086,0.2388,1.6258,3.8492,2.6003,3.9302,6.731,1.3536,0.7296,4.666,3.8257,2.6906,4.9456,2.7572,0.153,1.2634,0.2738,4.2064,3.4105,1.2797,4.7469,4.7342,5.0373,5.1814,9.9559,0.65,2.5313,4.1495,2.0269,6.9071,0.0503,0.7598,0.4098,4.4915,3.4853,0.0835,1.2904,6.2693,2.2633,4.2385,1.6067,2.2277,2.8931,2.4487,3.2141,5.0351,0.0521,3.696,3.5027,0.0046,0.0151,1.7776,0.5207,0.9106,2.1118,5.1939,1.6628,4.9514,0.4339,0.7409,2.1156,2.9065,0.9929,0.6286,3.6933,4.9068,6.5371,1.664,1.4695,3.545,0.0676,3.365,1.8303,1.9125,2.1873,2.4068,2.0025,5.653,0.0719,4.3138,0.8338,0.2827,3.8137,0.6867,1.2626,5.1171,2.192,5.6188,0.0008,1.178,7.8713,0.6533,4.4169,6.6786,0.5294,2.7574,7.0108,0.3213,6.8152,0.1924,1.8276,3.3128,7.1353,0.9317,2.8665,0.368,1.2722,1.1213,3.0451,2.1635,4.1319,5.6296,0.0028,0.8085,0.5804,4.0987,1.6512,2.3464,4.3048,5.8391,5.6806,4.1977,4.5568,5.0705,4.8774,5.0276,4.822,0.3421]}

The Prime Minister announced he would stay home until after Christmas, and said he would continue to call for a two week \"pre-Christmas\" break.\n\nOn Friday, the Minister of Justice announced she had appointed a Commission of inquiry into the dissolution of the HNC. She says it was put in place to investigate the issue and make recommendations to the government and to the National Assembly and the National People's Party. That means she won't face any action from the government or the national assembly when she calls for the resolution of the dissolution until her own time.\n\nLater on Thursday, Suu's party leader, Suu Ka Bhu, told VOA that the party was considering a request from the National Assembly to dissolve the HNC under its rules. If that is not completed, Suu said, she will resign. She says all measures are being taken to find a resolution.\n\n\"What the government needs is a resolution, or at least an order of the National Assembly to vote in accordance with the law,\" the National Assembly speaker said.\n\nOn Tuesday, L\u011bp \u010ce\u010dik, HNC president and chairman, asked for an extension of six months to hold a meeting on the issue. He says nothing more is being done about the dissolution until after the General Assembly has passed a resolution. He also urged the assembly to postpone the decision until the HNA had passed a resolution that could change the rules.\n\nOn the same day, the National Assembly convened again to meet again on the issue. There have been discussions on the possibility of a special session on Monday and Tuesday in this respect. The decision to call a special session was made after a request to the National Assembly to vote on the resolution was rejected.\n\nL\u011bp \u010ce\u010dik said there were now a number of representatives in different countries, but the only solution to the dissolution is an independent and constitutional Assembly. \"At present the HNC is based on constitutional law... It is an illegal arrangement. Now we will consider the alternative.\"\n\nHe said he and Suu had agreed to stay together as long as the National Assembly had passed a resolution.\n\nBoth Luh Luh and Soh V\u0151h said they will discuss the issue with the National Assembly and try to reach a solution before Holi.","token_len":529,"entropy":[10.2275,5.9521,6.5966,12.7931,0.5804,1.5575,2.4329,3.7509,9.1125,0.3944,1.2866,7.2243,3.153,10.6021,0.0332,0.1907,6.1417,1.0125,9.88,0.4062,0.3222,5.9921,11.396,1.3015,2.8717,0.0542,0.0136,0.0003,0.0024,0.0003,3.0741,1.7052,4.431,8.0554,4.593,3.0054,3.7145,2.6396,7.2147,0.7499,0.5392,6.2889,1.8522,0.9143,5.4288,0.3729,4.8912,2.5799,3.9685,0.6863,3.7605,6.2647,1.4542,3.2259,3.7539,0.0066,5.6922,3.7258,0.6549,5.0543,5.3614,2.8624,2.6171,4.3298,1.6648,2.2307,4.041,0.799,0.8785,3.5896,0.7757,4.6713,1.7474,1.945,5.4066,5.4443,5.3383,5.2028,0.9456,3.1948,1.9429,2.197,0.8245,0.914,0.0033,3.0096,3.9712,0.4333,2.0911,5.6264,0.6748,3.067,2.2907,4.5378,2.1727,3.5155,1.5472,6.1292,1.5873,4.9947,1.0108,0.5904,5.7473,0.1391,0.2337,0.1772,0.2395,0.6148,3.0716,6.0474,2.2,2.5598,6.1692,0.9904,0.2447,1.1562,1.8692,1.2637,4.1269,2.4157,4.8276,0.5188,1.5313,0.6016,1.8879,3.4428,2.3835,0.6658,4.5102,0.7058,4.0218,1.2885,2.9896,3.6197,0.0175,4.9566,0.67,6.3115,4.5506,2.8007,3.9759,0.0117,4.1557,1.44,5.4264,2.0605,0.4579,1.8521,2.9174,0.8236,4.841,2.2867,5.2824,1.2059,5.0798,0.2321,2.0212,6.8139,1.1562,0.1902,2.2716,6.98,4.6401,4.0191,2.7697,0.2824,0.427,0.0003,6.3531,1.1273,2.9056,0.2226,2.5716,0.011,3.5242,4.1567,3.703,1.2684,4.847,2.4836,7.8965,5.4248,6.5338,0.919,2.7194,6.4085,0.119,1.065,1.4996,3.7093,1.9114,4.0427,2.1038,4.6683,0.7673,0.5183,2.4553,0.4723,0.7229,2.9296,0.189,0.3042,0.2042,5.909,3.7919,3.7323,0.5902,4.8597,2.1766,2.168,1.4882,6.3971,0.452,1.631,0.0011,1.113,0.8962,2.8568,0.8141,2.9952,1.1371,3.8912,3.6423,5.9726,6.7346,2.5893,1.103,0.4699,0.379,5.9342,0.7458,3.0207,1.1508,0.353,0.0002,2.4295,4.4931,3.1444,2.3202,2.9511,1.554,1.234,1.8145,2.8909,4.3551,2.0414,0.1404,2.2305,3.6004,2.4811,1.0856,1.0321,0.0821,1.3377,7.0267,3.2343,3.518,0.0296,0.7302,1.8666,0.7727,3.9293,3.2771,1.0986,3.4135,1.1241,0.6841,0.8794,0.0002,3.0924,2.7441,0.1748,6.9457,4.9674,2.5561,4.6064,5.4273,2.2218,3.1106,5.9009,4.9718,1.461,4.2199,4.5002,2.25,2.3539,2.6248,0.5813,4.2456,2.5147,2.3526,4.6308,0.3831,4.9424,0.4586,1.348,4.529,0.9272,1.7377,2.8041,0.5491,1.7457,0.773,1.4878,2.5465,7.246,5.1493,1.2721,1.6327,0.7577,3.7607,0.6504,3.011,3.9651,1.925,0.9262,6.1868,1.6972,3.4629,2.0418,1.5889,0.5028,0.8206,2.7013,1.7874,5.1673,0.6029,5.7517,0.182,4.8637,0.5987,3.5182,0.6008,1.8749,5.7469,1.2467,4.2885,3.5284,1.0528,0.6057,3.6752,2.9046,3.8199,0.299,2.8895,1.1152,0.345,0.0002,2.4532,3.3521,2.9953,0.0587,0.2572,1.684,1.6732,0.4844,5.66,5.2725,0.835,4.3711,1.8964,1.3626,0.3347,0.6581,1.065,4.2596,3.9393,0.0977,4.518,1.2777,0.9231,3.1573,0.0583,1.6334,3.7873,0.9886,2.498,4.376,2.7735,0.3737,3.576,6.2688,4.5791,0.5081,2.0033,5.5408,1.4343,3.4124,1.2246,0.3342,0.194,1.6892,1.7846,1.8295,1.8791,5.8133,3.7879,1.1629,0.9374,0.0292,3.0134,5.215,1.0639,0.548,2.2156,2.1395,3.0676,0.8258,0.5809,0.0002,4.4323,0.3335,0.0057,0.027,0.1184,0.0403,0.0232,0.0021,0.0019,1.6302,3.5023,1.8127,6.0044,3.5093,0.7348,0.0016,6.2302,2.6482,6.9641,4.7734,2.4454,2.4307,2.4051,4.2695,6.0515,1.8536,0.3242,2.5262,2.5901,3.8329,4.2347,3.6018,5.5117,3.7789,0.6603,2.9439,5.2084,1.708,2.5201,3.2365,1.3625,1.1279,5.6316,0.7537,5.3789,2.9444,7.0266,3.3083,0.9364,3.8717,4.4484,5.2002,1.935,5.3781,1.6035,2.2006,4.1682,1.5928,5.61,3.2251,0.2923,0.0002,3.2824,1.0987,2.0122,3.3288,0.9478,0.0012,1.2883,2.387,0.5178,3.2341,0.4129,3.6449,1.2624,0.0027,1.6199,1.937,0.0075,2.72,2.0074,0.3007,0.2455,1.6131,1.6006,0.0002,5.9193,5.4396,2.1413,10.6448,1.925,0.8786,5.6902,4.7573,5.6799,3.7017,1.9037,5.6797,3.095,0.7963,3.9627,5.12,0.4407,1.2244,1.8651,0.5814,0.6113,0.0171,2.0853,5.8185,0.0625,2.2561,0.4877,1.798,3.2064,8.3553,1.8576,1.1801]}
{"id":3617,"ended":true,"length":459,"text":"Aside from individual reports of self @ - @ medicated use in the treatment of depression, research suggests that Salvia divinorum, in line with the studied effects of other \u03ba @ - @ - - [M] treatments, is a protective agent of anti-psychotic and anti-psychotic drugs (the antipsychotic\/psychotic drugs of choice for treating depression).\n\nIn spite of the widespread use of SSRI drug combinations containing antipsychotic effects, not a single study has been conducted to determine whether serotonergic or other phenolic compounds acting as antipsychotic agents, if any and how effective they are for treating depression. In particular, only two studies were carried out on the incidence and the effects of serotonergic or other phenolic compounds and were used in combination as antipsychotic medications. No further studies of serotonergic or others phenolic compounds were carried out with either combination. Of the remaining 30 serotonergic compounds, only 5 compounds were effective in treating depression and had anti-psychotic effects. In addition, even the effects of serotonergic or other phenolic compounds were not effective in treating depression.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the effectiveness of SSRI drugs in treating depression and other mental health conditions, as described earlier, may be decreased by taking the SSRI, e.g., as part of therapy. A similar evaluation of dosage requirements of SSRI drug combinations or treatments in the treatment of depression is already known. To this end, the use of antidepressants known as antidepressants has not been investigated in relation to potential treatment for depression.\n\nThe only known approach to treating depression that could potentially prevent the use of SSRI drugs is by decreasing the dosage of the SSRI drug by the user, and the use of the SSRI drug more frequently than the antidepressant treatment. Therefore, this approach could have many negative effects including the possibility of a significant difference in the efficacy (and safety) of the antidepressant therapy, and the likelihood that the user of the tablet will be unable to use it.\n\nFurthermore, the present invention is directed to use of any of the above pharmaceutical treatments as antipsychotic medication, in the treatment of which depression as described above can be treated with less than ideal dose to reduce the risk of suicide.\n\nThe present invention is particularly directed to treating depression using an antipsychotic formulation of Salvia divinorum. The present invention can be used for the treatment of acute withdrawal symptoms by a combination of antipsychotic and antipsychotic drugs of interest.

Habitat use by gray wolves is strongly correlated with the abundance of fur and bone, and is likely related to the number of bears that can be released, the species composition of the habitat, and the number of species of wolf in the area, the largest study of populations of wolf (a) in the western world (b) in the eastern world (c), Greenland (d), North America (e), Arctic, Atlantic, and Pacific.\n\nThe largest gray wolf population recorded and reported by the European paleontological society was present in the Arctic region from about 7100 to 9200 years ago, but the numbers have had to be reduced because the wolves have recently lost much of their prey. The largest gray wolves were found at Arctic and Caspian Sea, Caspian Sea, and Arctic Ocean.\n\nAccording to the paleontological society, the gray wolf and its population in most areas has been significantly reduced. The wolf population in Greenland increased from about 0.8 million to about 33 million with the expansion of the Greenland area, and in the eastern part of the Arctic, the wolf population increased from about 300,000 in the mid-1990s (c) to about 300,000 in 1997. The wolf population in the western part of the world declined from about 17 million to about 5 million although the population grew in various provinces of the western world (e) and Northern Europe (s). There are about 11 million gray wolves of the same age and species in the northern Europe (e) region and the western area, between about 40% and 85% of the population occur in the southern Europe and the northern part of the world.\n\nThe wolf population in the western region also declined significantly compared to the wolf population in the northern Europe, and the largest population of European gray wolves recorded by the paleontological society was recorded in the Arctic. From about 1750 to 1520 the population of gray wolves in northern Europe decreased significantly along with the population of European gray wolves in northern Europe.\n\nThe gray wolf population of northern Europe had been decreased mainly as a result of wolf population changes between 19.6 to 22.2 million years ago. However, wolf population is still present in the northern Europe, and the Arctic region is mainly under the control of wolves.

Shank, the Native Americans of Pennsylvania warned white settlers that great floods occurred on the Delaware and Susquehanna rivers every 14 years.\nShank, who is also the director of the state's Environmental Working Menagerie, estimates that water flows have increased on the Delaware and Susquehanna rivers by up to eight metres per year between 1997 and 2001 \u2013 including on Sunday.\nThe Delaware had lost up to 20 per cent of its water flow in 1997 due to the floods, reports the Pittsburgh Times.\nThe Delaware and Susquehanna and the Penn Hills rivers have had water levels of up to 3.7 metres per year since the beginning of the century, but the water levels had risen in recent decades.\nThe river water on the Susquehanna river in Berks County in Pennsylvania on Saturday, March 7, 2021. (Photo by Justin Martell Getty)\n\"We also know that there's water on the water on the Susquehanna River, both of those rivers,\" Shank said.\nIn August 2020, a storm system killed 16 people in the Berks County town of Millville, prompting authorities to temporarily shut down some sections of the state's roads and cut off the state's entire rail network.\nOn Sunday morning, the water levels were up to 3.7metres more than they had been last year, according to the Department of Environment, Planning and Forests.\n'It might have happened when we were in Pennsylvania,' said Pa. State Superintendent of Agriculture William J. Shaw, who said that as a result of the floods on the river that could have killed more than a hundred people.\nShaw said that Pennsylvania would continue to evacuate people who live on shore and to take steps to minimize their situation on shore.\nHe also said that anyone who feels ill should evacuate to a safe place.\n\"There are hundreds of people who can't walk. And they're not covered with blankets, so they need to go see a doctor,\" he said.\n\"I'm just warning people and the best thing to do is wash your hands and get up and do some self-disclosure,\" he added.\nShaw said he could not confirm whether the swells were related to the flooding caused by the wet rivers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\nShaw said that an extra three weeks of drought were already being imposed on the Susquehanna and the Pennsylvania rivers by a state water regulator which will now be forced to stop issuing new water alerts and use a reserve in a bid to minimize further flooding.","token_len":530,"entropy":[9.6618,2.7732,12.913,3.2648,7.6418,5.06,2.4972,4.7942,0.0016,7.783,3.374,0.4517,10.9394,1.6387,2.358,10.0451,4.1703,1.5534,2.1999,7.653,8.1601,1.0613,0.9923,8.9801,2.2434,5.673,3.3206,1.2678,4.8001,2.8058,5.6973,0.0001,0.0003,0.0083,0.5196,5.0449,7.5803,0.9551,0.7096,1.525,17.369,0.0193,2.7956,1.0471,2.113,2.1734,1.5668,1.9389,0.0155,0.3662,5.8658,0.3939,3.1329,5.1406,11.3572,2.9931,0.0306,0.3137,4.406,0.3099,5.0209,3.8535,4.2288,2.083,5.1628,1.6332,0.8393,1.3387,0.3369,0.0074,0.0011,0.0104,0.5367,2.6544,3.8141,0.0034,5.612,6.9829,0.879,0.2306,4.4018,6.1126,0.0792,3.7312,6.1888,5.6249,3.0284,6.9501,1.936,0.8389,2.2207,2.651,6.2399,6.1699,4.1477,0.0041,3.5254,1.0281,0.0008,0.0394,0.0658,1.3353,6.7339,1.5988,3.6618,3.6872,0.0261,1.7153,2.7058,1.0408,6.6554,1.3601,3.7115,3.98,2.6629,0.9715,2.0142,3.8055,3.5179,0.1415,0.0051,0.002,0.0099,6.7801,2.1867,4.4771,7.3355,2.7484,2.1479,3.7362,4.2537,2.9455,2.6588,1.1828,0.005,4.2053,1.1818,2.6845,0.2811,0.2503,0.1583,1.5723,1.5181,3.1557,0.0024,0.2725,2.2447,0.9708,2.7469,1.6913,3.465,1.5815,5.1118,2.205,3.2155,2.3635,1.8851,0.9465,0.6083,1.8163,3.8431,4.6055,5.1655,0.6913,2.1196,0.0126,0.004,0.0047,4.5617,2.8365,5.7292,0.3511,3.5471,0.6832,3.6871,2.6148,1.8044,2.6485,3.4492,0.3528,10.6037,0.3756,1.9154,1.1453,1.2301,5.2614,7.3763,5.819,7.2737,3.7063,0.4683,2.2564,2.5834,5.4853,2.6164,0.4334,2.3885,2.0303,3.7983,2.5704,0.4347,4.9493,3.8573,0.5689,1.0402,0.0108,0.0018,0.0054,3.1019,2.0303,5.9367,3.5153,3.287,0.4869,1.2671,1.7101,0.7935,0.2283,1.0036,3.3021,5.2593,8.6466,0.1774,2.4831,4.278,5.5672,5.6811,4.7441,0.2281,1.1577,1.5019,2.1866,0.1395,2.4169,0.0214,5.8503,2.281,0.8905,5.4362,4.105,0.1191,4.7654,1.2304,0.1774,3.7466,4.7228,0.0151,0.2165,3.7085,0.3851,3.9022,1.8532,5.2067,0.9966,2.337,3.5303,0.4443,4.5775,4.4126,1.5199,0.3706,0.7151,4.2047,2.3481,2.6741,0.1612,1.7425,4.2273,1.2173,2.3107,2.8812,0.2126,1.8888,0.2222,0.5104,9.0185,0.0896,6.2897,0.1775,4.0665,1.0229,0.1248,5.7536,0.8347,0.9757,0.955,0.0019,0.9379,5.3011,0.0046,2.984,2.8704,7.0793,0.159,6.3958,0.5336,0.2585,0.4668,6.4086,3.6278,5.8827,2.0648,3.8616,5.2007,1.8931,1.484,2.5638,2.9473,2.2135,1.3305,5.8509,0.8951,2.972,6.3735,2.1734,5.0435,4.8755,4.0577,0.1352,7.3355,1.8519,1.0472,2.2595,2.2839,4.3509,2.5556,1.2752,0.1351,0.4845,2.6866,2.7615,1.3481,4.5155,5.1182,5.476,0.7675,2.2129,2.728,0.2741,3.7453,2.5456,0.2401,2.6493,0.6117,2.4482,2.2189,0.6655,1.0854,3.6555,4.2163,3.4476,0.1624,6.2682,1.7857,2.2168,2.3104,2.0514,7.2514,2.1681,3.505,3.9476,3.5078,0.066,4.0819,3.1977,7.4483,3.4625,2.0857,0.4108,0.4687,3.2243,2.1796,0.6092,0.3227,6.2039,0.5236,4.8902,5.2367,2.5405,6.8245,2.1265,1.0285,2.2884,0.8753,1.174,0.3622,1.4238,3.2197,1.3278,5.2459,0.2349,0.9394,1.0842,3.3005,0.895,3.8242,3.4498,3.1095,2.676,1.3971,2.5667,6.0321,2.653,0.4869,1.8695,2.0748,1.1462,3.0356,0.5051,2.6021,5.4249,0.7379,0.1502,1.0375,0.9294,0.1117,0.0808,0.4166,3.1612,2.9125,2.0128,3.1833,6.1034,1.0561,4.0536,3.3038,5.9636,0.7641,1.5215,0.0205,0.201,7.289,1.1226,0.1592,1.3286,2.3839,3.7441,1.3488,3.3531,2.3776,4.8316,0.4698,5.0092,5.736,1.4675,0.992,0.8937,0.0904,0.3868,1.5656,0.2643,0.6202,3.0145,4.3572,0.2705,3.4824,1.8171,1.3675,8.095,0.5404,1.4323,2.9127,0.0819,0.7214,1.9401,4.4572,0.016,0.6329,7.8191,6.09,3.6372,1.1196,2.8152,3.2513,0.5272,0.394,0.425,2.9009,0.589,0.6132,0.7859,5.4734,5.5093,4.0823,4.3744,0.7697,6.0386,5.4367,3.9817,4.4633,4.4734,0.8281,0.6693,6.5733,0.0099,0.0027,0.0037,0.6521,2.3183,1.4904,1.3882,2.3899,4.1248,5.3648,4.3019,5.0797,4.7199,3.4795,4.1069,1.5884,4.1613,0.1178,3.2677,2.2856,3.5296,1.0821,3.8915,3.2265,6.2103,2.2976,6.8045,4.149,4.1804,4.7296,0.0066,5.0603,5.017,1.0264,0.34]}

However, things were still on their way home after six months. The couple made out at the villa that night and she said she missed him dearly and they were \u201cnever married\u201d. Recently, they were spotted together in Mumbai.\n\nIt was the film that made both of the duo get into a panic. They didn\u2019t realise that in the midst of filming the film, they would have to take a taxi home.\n\nThere had been a lot of rumours that Sushant was dating his girlfriend Sangeet Sambhasa but she denied the rumours.\n\nThe duo\u2019s relationship was definitely not \u2018so bad\u2019, it seems, because after eight months of marriage, they stayed in touch and had a lot of fun together. The couple said that in the movie, which aired on March 16, 2018, they decided to split up to enjoy the time.\n\nSpeaking about the film, Sushant\u2019s parents, Deepika and Manali, had made it clear that Sushant would always be their son, and a part of him wanted to be left alone.\n\nHowever, he wanted both of them to know that it was a mistake for them to make.","token_len":532,"entropy":[6.6235,4.5461,4.4239,7.0564,0.5271,5.9096,7.4361,7.526,0.8055,1.1804,3.7964,3.0246,4.3667,4.7769,0.6593,6.093,2.5425,9.6294,0.336,6.889,4.0701,0.6003,1.0771,0.8034,0.7179,1.8856,2.6582,0.304,1.6823,5.0876,1.2847,2.5386,2.342,3.343,0.6795,3.2238,3.0111,2.7347,0.6182,8.443,11.2606,0.9861,2.4179,0.151,0.0892,0.8923,5.9077,1.4619,1.2836,0.5571,0.0677,6.1662,5.441,1.8748,2.4086,2.4597,3.5995,2.2776,3.8007,2.641,1.669,1.1015,1.9272,0.9233,5.5184,3.8096,3.5617,2.9287,5.336,3.2349,1.3608,5.3765,5.1678,3.5082,0.6743,3.7131,8.1593,0.7251,3.3135,3.3944,0.0008,7.811,6.1502,1.195,3.0437,2.9073,2.8995,0.7525,4.3083,0.7686,0.4477,0.8359,3.3152,5.5382,2.1673,2.8154,1.0384,2.66,7.5924,3.3857,0.5872,2.0433,4.0963,1.4918,3.5429,3.8896,0.0226,0.0093,1.8254,0.0276,1.6518,0.9817,5.3774,4.4933,3.6098,6.1533,2.4094,1.1771,0.0027,2.9089,1.8789,3.0918,2.414,1.75,3.497,5.273,4.8715,2.1987,1.427,0.1233,6.7268,1.2541,0.0979,3.6287,0.2622,2.3588,2.3815,0.3344,1.194,0.6141,1.673,0.0002,1.8726,0.1705,0.0009,6.2154,1.6949,12.3831,5.6616,3.5799,1.4499,3.9949,2.4389,2.6236,3.4723,1.3362,0.519,0.0413,3.5662,1.4351,2.3475,1.795,1.315,2.07,1.7573,5.1677,2.8161,4.5353,2.4539,0.8557,0.6462,2.9247,2.3853,5.1556,0.7068,6.4789,5.5096,1.5585,0.9208,0.389,1.1115,3.9672,2.0212,3.3384,5.1503,2.8152,0.9753,0.3109,2.9664,0.9307,2.7798,1.9994,5.3129,1.0796,4.6425,0.813,5.8495,7.7582,1.2141,0.0002,1.6195,0.2144,0.0008,2.9495,1.6332,4.2034,0.0918,6.0558,3.4024,3.7958,4.6553,1.877,6.6003,0.377,4.8467,5.4351,6.2726,2.3899,2.1796,0.0986,2.0699,1.6928,3.1361,2.6808,6.2052,5.4061,3.2906,4.9823,5.5043,1.937,3.1412,2.8801,1.7925,2.872,4.8043,0.7016,1.43,2.0464,5.6098,0.9064,0.4602,0.6557,0.0002,4.9909,0.2065,0.0355,0.6628,6.7017,1.908,0.1148,0.1298,1.8158,0.3729,0.0041,10.6023,8.4026,3.5434,7.3673,2.251,7.0686,0.0019,4.4096,5.3743,2.0831,0.0861,2.5047,1.9032,1.9005,2.5935,2.6015,5.0148,0.7467,2.8192,2.8837,3.4184,0.4829,10.2472,0.3354,2.5253,0.0622,5.6182,2.5772,4.4642,3.909,3.3368,1.106,9.3438,2.0222,5.6042,0.5713,1.0325,2.6101,2.5711,5.6224,6.1179,3.0629,1.4361,7.0002,0.0077,3.8326,1.7068,1.2783,5.0287,3.7948,1.8196,6.2329,1.2252,5.1283,2.361,3.8234,2.1338,15.4886,0.8941,5.3869,4.0837,2.7895,3.7806,1.2721,7.7579,0.1931,2.2192,2.5149,4.4493,1.0131,1.5238,3.0035,1.1448,0.7134,0.0003,4.8616,0.9538,3.1394,6.1796,1.1626,3.3358,5.7638,1.9,3.4362,4.579,5.6462,2.1718,1.9705,5.8954,1.3737,2.1423,5.1914,7.0129,7.9327,0.0089,4.6588,1.0136,5.4334,1.4459,3.4998,0.0009,5.7277,2.7014,0.9336,0.5454,1.2643,1.6715,2.6016,0.4845,3.5735,1.7085,3.2034,3.0666,1.3584,1.6756,0.0003,5.5589,3.5951,0.2634,1.8918,1.6453,0.0525,2.3821,1.4911,2.8891,0.0066,0.0257,1.9896,5.3995,3.4695,4.5893,3.4952,5.3491,1.1468,7.237,3.9162,4.1194,3.6251,4.3653,2.3786,4.6782,2.2027,0.718,0.4548,1.3122,0.0002,2.4095,3.6993,6.7974,2.2283,0.1509,0.5526,1.0921,8.9975,1.6466,13.2077,6.9596,7.7281,3.8435,1.7482,3.0857,2.7379,3.8505,4.1062,1.6281,2.2818,4.8828,6.1215,0.4325,1.267,2.4149,0.2848,1.1797,6.7549,1.5884,1.3192,1.999,2.9539,0.8963,3.4179,0.0735,0.9859,0.8692,0.12,3.3581,0.8989,4.6277,1.1451,3.6555,0.8548,5.83,0.5582,5.4291,5.6469,0.8221,3.5262,3.6183,0.1339,3.9064,0.0721,0.7733,4.4034,0.1823,3.7589,0.3426,3.4302,5.7311,1.9546,3.4671,4.2195,0.4824,0.0002,5.8775,1.9296,0.7949,2.1074,0.4279,1.3051,0.013,0.0305,3.378,0.0419,0.0129,3.6727,2.5515,7.4506,1.4752,0.3509,5.0249,7.2869,0.782,4.0141,5.033,1.7938,0.3819,0.2309,3.7469,0.0229,0.0194,2.1444,3.7484,0.8847,1.8647,2.646,2.5098,1.4568,5.5053,2.779,0.0924,3.7468,6.8984,0.1364,1.56,6.5816,0.2345,0.5468,0.7841,0.0002,4.2188,0.012,3.631,4.0274,7.5724,0.6896,0.2307,0.1015,4.0529,0.2192,3.3815,0.3996,2.6845,4.6404,2.3596,0.9829,0.2348,3.8779,7.5706]}

Its use was known among almost all of the Uralic @ - @ speaking peoples of western Siberia, and not by the native speakers of Siberia.\n\nThe Siberian people who knew the native speakers of Siberian @ -, didn't have a clue about their cultures, languages, customs, and their needs. It was a very different time for those of us who had lost our cultural connection to the natural world and the cultures who lived in that realm, in Russia and elsewhere.\n\nIt was also very different to the old ways of Russian culture and language, which were very different to the old ways of Soviet Russia. One had to deal with the culture of the ethnic Chinese and the ethnic Russians in Siberia as well as all those other people. Our old way of life was always based on old Soviet Culture. Most Russian people did not understand much about our past or our past culture either in Russia or the rest of Eurasia. We are not supposed to use our natural resources, food, clothing, and other such things as an excuse to live in a Russian society.\n\nWe know that we have no use of all and every culture in our lives and it\u2019s sad\n\nSo what we know today is that the peoples of Siberia went for a change as well. Most of our ancestors had their lands seized and moved to new lands. Our civilization developed at a very rapid pace. It's a fact that our ancestors lived a few hundred years sooner than most other peoples in Siberia.\n\nIt would appear that our ancestors were completely different to most others. We are not supposed to use any of the things from Russia or other lands from which our ancestors were actually from. There are many cultures that we have left on our planet, some of them have been made of ice, some of them are extinct. These cultures are all in the same place, all have their own history, different cultures and traditions, and of course none of us is supposed to use all of them.\n\nOur ancestors did not have any history to live in their land, and even if they do, in the same way that most other peoples have lived in Russia, it seems that it's impossible for us to keep our history alive at all in our new lands and our own time as a peoples of Siberia.\n\nIt is very frustrating to read stories like this about our ancestors, and to see those stories being read by our young people and not our elders.

When Kana\u02bbina died, the court considered the rights and the interests of the family. The royal lands were granted by Kana\u02bbina to his eldest son, while he was still a minor. The family, the king and their royal fathers did not have a legitimate claim for those lands. The court gave up all claims against the royal lands after the son was admitted to the throne, and the Crown held no claims. The Crown kept up claims on and on until his death, and it was determined that he only had a legitimate claim against the lands if the monarch was held responsible for that land.\nThe crown and his royal fathers did not get to keep those lands. Kana\u02bbina has claimed a claim to a claim of the Kingdom of Nakhon Pahang in his first will, but that claim was rejected due to the lack of proof in court, and he died on 18 Jan. 1723. The prince remained a royal child until his birth. The king took custody of his son, and had him married to his second wife and to the queen. In 1731 he married Kana\u02bbina to the queen. The king is said to have given Kana\u02bbina $15,000 in an inheritance. In 1731 the king inherited a small portion of the lands, and after Kana\u02bbina died he left the entire land to his eldest sons, and after his son was added to the family, Kana\u02bbina inherited the whole land. When the land was sold the prince was found to have lost all these lands. The prince claimed the lands from each of his brothers, and afterwards he left the lands to his eldest sons, leaving the lands to his eldest son to live on. In 1736 Kana\u02bbina passed away due to heart failure, and he was given the right to keep all the lands for him. But it was still unclear how this title would be retained by the king. He had his estate divided, and even if he was allowed to maintain it. In 1741, Kana\u02bbina gave up many lands to his eldest sons, and finally his son died. The King was unable to keep these lands as he died on 18 Jan. 1773. The King was not able to retain them and the inheritance passed on to his sons, without any proof of the owner or owner\u2019s claim. This may have been the result of his neglect of his family.","token_len":533,"entropy":[8.1526,7.3988,0.4919,7.0465,10.7305,0.6404,8.0675,1.2931,0.6148,7.8273,6.8571,5.3498,3.1897,0.4911,5.3863,0.9239,3.2135,3.6265,5.5302,2.843,1.933,1.7493,2.9024,3.766,2.3638,1.5554,5.3581,1.6404,3.8191,1.672,0.4236,5.4181,3.9756,4.292,0.1044,0.0564,0.0028,0.0047,1.6511,0.5659,1.9265,4.7352,5.7397,1.697,5.3785,3.2232,4.6789,2.5939,0.0965,0.8584,3.621,2.9397,2.2775,3.4627,2.3727,0.9364,4.5634,2.4206,1.9151,0.0087,0.0325,0.0021,0.0018,1.6032,1.3886,3.5557,0.233,0.7948,4.8705,3.1624,1.1513,1.4625,0.7958,0.3737,0.5087,2.0605,3.3142,4.5921,4.564,4.147,1.8725,2.7345,5.0663,8.0235,4.4764,0.0621,2.5596,2.3534,5.9796,0.8011,3.0637,4.6627,0.1974,0.8198,2.0323,2.5869,4.9699,3.5396,2.518,2.1877,3.2977,1.0753,1.4858,2.0297,3.2943,1.7778,4.1379,1.9368,6.3012,0.56,0.6768,4.2791,1.9341,0.9674,1.5712,6.4067,5.0155,2.3534,3.1175,2.9862,1.7521,3.0238,5.6776,6.1268,5.6762,3.122,7.0072,2.3562,2.1464,3.0846,0.6319,1.3424,1.4928,3.5938,2.3052,4.4117,0.2669,2.2115,7.0546,0.7201,1.7957,4.08,0.1198,3.2074,0.5236,2.6448,4.9624,2.0771,6.1101,2.6961,5.5333,1.362,0.1664,5.1742,4.1104,0.4825,1.4015,5.9272,4.0646,3.6013,2.764,3.6601,1.7744,2.6148,0.1707,5.0625,2.0793,3.3795,3.3975,0.4593,1.7447,2.5815,0.0069,0.0126,0.0029,0.0024,5.7689,3.8227,3.5991,2.8778,2.2765,3.286,6.4692,2.3807,1.7633,5.0279,0.1571,4.39,5.0285,0.8548,8.3682,2.9323,3.4807,2.5301,3.2877,5.7749,8.387,1.2526,1.5739,3.0744,0.3822,1.3194,3.9584,4.3629,0.0028,1.1244,3.3441,0.001,3.8148,3.6782,1.6276,2.6824,0.6764,2.239,4.0423,2.5458,4.4796,4.1361,1.097,3.6992,5.1131,0.5657,1.6607,5.4312,5.5174,2.4399,4.7568,5.1331,0.8635,0.6221,6.7426,1.9769,2.0517,2.8929,3.8533,3.7767,0.0388,2.2589,1.5433,1.5062,1.0969,5.2369,1.107,4.0276,2.1181,2.0207,2.2381,0.4703,3.6297,3.6115,2.1269,3.5863,1.1297,3.0982,2.0022,3.7053,3.3587,1.8506,2.9274,0.2313,0.1564,0.0037,0.0041,3.5421,1.835,1.4902,1.3481,1.6857,1.8639,5.1918,1.7065,0.0405,0.0286,2.9677,1.4556,0.0014,0.0213,0.0043,0.002,6.5867,3.924,0.2544,0.0926,2.3025,5.8758,3.8128,2.1519,2.7532,0.5063,3.5197,1.3821,0.9485,4.9407,2.4986,3.5147,1.5909,0.0221,0.3106,1.8106,2.6234,1.0761,3.6438,1.4113,0.0012,0.0007,0.0038,0.0035,0.748,2.5734,3.5965,0.8747,5.8727,2.6605,0.9519,0.5801,2.4862,6.0879,1.2819,1.5702,3.6888,1.1253,1.0618,1.283,6.5033,0.263,0.1726,3.2256,1.1796,2.0466,0.001,0.0032,0.0051,0.0031,3.6936,0.8375,3.5534,2.0626,0.8747,4.0409,1.5082,4.6128,0.4486,3.0907,4.8958,4.0143,2.7161,5.157,1.455,0.5334,3.1473,1.6635,5.6983,0.7071,1.0328,1.5795,3.1687,4.3372,1.6053,1.1806,4.0398,6.7683,0.2723,0.4353,4.1757,0.8095,0.7313,5.9356,1.913,3.238,1.1941,1.193,0.4315,0.2481,1.5028,0.7807,1.5216,4.6532,1.5324,2.1715,0.3376,0.4271,1.3328,1.6517,4.8113,4.4865,1.2406,0.797,2.4539,0.3606,2.5413,1.6694,0.0016,0.0051,0.007,0.003,4.8838,0.3838,4.3908,0.0041,4.0385,1.3487,1.1335,0.5189,2.1956,1.3815,4.0088,1.4689,3.3135,0.2407,4.2765,2.1083,0.8839,0.4721,3.3331,4.4036,0.8505,5.4777,3.63,0.5783,6.0628,2.6132,2.0019,4.4504,4.5831,1.7619,0.4747,4.0601,1.7289,0.8407,1.257,1.0383,3.1685,2.5421,3.7489,5.5095,1.1521,3.2474,0.4771,5.5745,2.5414,0.7975,3.0112,2.7003,0.1476,4.2404,1.5625,5.7366,2.3696,0.2688,2.7655,2.5169,1.4838,0.0024,0.0027,0.0077,0.0031,4.1991,1.4393,5.9297,2.095,2.1037,0.5731,0.9049,1.0678,0.5217,0.5468,5.2843,2.9653,2.7782,1.9596,1.7901,1.719,3.5276,3.1749,3.7818,0.0036,2.4544,3.6205,0.1112,3.7809,1.1339,3.3004,2.6989,1.5362,0.5466,0.0955,0.3172,6.1491,0.5355,1.897,2.2426,2.7118,2.6539,1.6043,0.0058,2.7297,2.7803,4.364,2.4844,5.9576,4.6575,1.712,0.2571,0.4948,2.4525,1.4263,6.4489,1.7271,5.2002,1.5385,2.2606,6.1957,3.1483,3.9432,13.2505,7.4471,3.2412,2.1555,0.7262,4.041,4.4624,0.8574,0.5837,1.8148,3.1374,0.0209,3.2568,4.6092,0.6061,1.4024,3.4535,1.5943]}

Williams, had the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation construct two modified biplanes, cleaned @ - @ up versions of the Grumman engine, cleaned on the grunnier Grinnell engines, cleaned to the \"new, original\" Grunnell, cleaned on the Grunnell engines, cleaned out of the #Grunnell \"new\" Grunnell & cleaned, cleaned out of the #Grunnell #GRUNELFUNCLOUD -, stripped, cleaned, and clean.\n\nThe Grumman Engineering Corporation and the new Grumman engines were installed in 1965 and 1973 respectively. Following the formation of the Grumman Engineering Corporation, the Grumman Engineering Corporation has begun the process of converting the old Grunnell factory to an actual Grunnell site.\n\nAfter a careful inspection, crews on the site were forced to remove numerous components that had proven detrimental to the design of the new Grunnell model plane. At this time, the engine and engine components were not in any need of replacing. It was determined shortly before the inspection that these components could be replaced. A series of mechanical and optical and electrical adjustments were placed in the engine bay, repair shops, and shop rooms to ensure that the existing material was up to snuff.\n\nIn February of 1966, repairs were completed to the engine bay and replacement parts were made available at $75,000\/unit. To this date, the maintenance of these parts has been made almost entirely by hand, only requiring the use of very little electrical equipment to perform the required repairs.\n\nThis process was then abandoned after the Grunnell manufacturer was deemed to pose a significant threat to the safety of passengers and crew.\n\nFollowing repairs to the Grunnell hull and fuselage and replacement of aircraft parts, the Grunnell manufacturer found itself unable to obtain the necessary supplies necessary for the required structural improvements, and the new aircraft parts were left to the workers for the purpose of replacing the damaged parts.\n\nDuring this time, the Grunnell factory is still closed, and even though the Grunnell manufacturer had not produced any aircraft parts for the new aircraft aircraft since 1968, it was possible for the manufacturer to obtain new airplanes from the fleet.\n\nAlthough the company does not have the resources to finance the repairs on its own, it can be seen that at this level, a business that could meet current maintenance rates, which are almost guaranteed throughout the business of this type of aviation, is very attractive for the Grumman Group.","token_len":533,"entropy":[2.6222,4.7182,4.0836,0.0769,0.3922,11.2746,7.0697,7.2076,8.8248,1.2067,7.8793,0.1205,5.8108,6.8638,4.8875,0.5894,5.6241,0.1788,3.3309,3.4741,10.1094,0.2163,0.028,4.0969,5.1582,2.6598,6.4789,3.6657,7.8309,8.9076,0.5126,1.8311,12.1785,15.7043,8.2992,5.81,7.8834,9.7005,0.2655,0.6687,3.3153,0.0035,0.0124,5.5175,1.1367,5.8534,6.3938,1.6488,6.665,6.7669,2.6314,5.5519,10.5003,1.6599,3.11,0.8794,3.7252,4.7693,2.0997,4.8544,3.6859,4.5556,5.3653,0.9102,2.374,7.039,6.7682,2.9141,2.6413,3.1513,0.6134,3.5438,0.5895,0.0272,2.5528,0.7103,1.3585,4.3311,2.2682,0.5497,6.4713,5.1996,3.6485,0.1339,5.4375,4.033,1.3426,1.827,0.4037,0.0097,5.9672,2.5309,4.4135,1.2013,2.2064,0.3382,0.4576,1.1307,1.0167,0.1048,0.0033,2.7134,4.4858,2.2607,12.5602,6.4791,6.9754,2.6979,0.1795,5.4884,7.0717,6.7701,2.1195,1.3812,0.8867,3.7614,4.5622,2.9708,2.3552,0.0267,2.1353,2.4428,0.8454,0.0184,6.7923,1.1254,4.678,1.3305,6.2096,1.5973,2.3742,0.0461,2.2181,0.7106,4.0181,1.1119,5.0107,2.2614,6.9833,1.608,0.5576,5.6453,0.8581,5.6333,0.03,0.3921,2.0415,0.375,0.0109,2.3044,0.1438,1.1958,0.8793,1.6553,0.3168,0.0066,3.4325,0.6157,4.9404,6.5143,2.7191,2.1702,0.0972,4.043,0.9361,3.3558,1.0942,1.6713,0.0625,7.3265,1.0828,2.6695,5.4224,2.6459,0.5579,0.0739,5.8336,0.661,1.427,0.0003,4.346,3.061,4.5116,1.9877,1.6359,6.9419,4.2154,0.668,3.2803,1.8851,5.953,0.0528,2.2418,6.7506,4.1279,2.9108,1.5236,6.554,5.363,0.1305,0.4385,5.6484,1.1519,0.1194,2.1026,1.3156,0.2577,0.0102,6.4114,5.8515,0.4525,4.9936,2.0571,1.4649,0.3121,0.9747,4.3962,2.9564,2.9735,5.2034,0.8002,3.1896,3.1959,4.3735,5.6606,0.1126,3.0801,0.8246,4.5402,0.6912,3.8942,9.2559,2.6317,0.8068,5.9231,0.2604,3.4895,1.2413,3.2169,0.8278,1.4911,1.5279,4.0942,4.6295,0.0041,5.3299,2.1151,7.0383,5.4627,1.0997,4.3339,0.4584,5.4918,1.8866,1.2801,2.0497,2.9402,2.0169,8.1717,5.5641,1.0918,0.5718,5.2411,5.64,1.2676,1.7313,0.8102,0.8451,5.0662,7.8187,1.4079,6.1992,0.0913,4.0737,0.0011,0.364,1.1365,0.0002,2.8445,4.7786,2.4728,3.4504,0.1427,6.842,0.8062,1.9774,1.3069,0.5336,1.2959,0.2734,1.4877,5.4298,0.7391,0.3205,3.6932,2.3993,3.9762,5.418,4.2479,1.0673,0.0568,6.0777,5.8224,0.5469,5.5093,2.4483,1.5689,0.1586,1.0225,5.7768,1.861,3.7051,0.9089,0.6966,0.6722,5.6416,4.4137,1.5636,2.242,2.684,2.0669,5.8814,3.2589,1.947,1.61,0.0026,5.8245,2.8591,4.6167,2.4307,3.9146,3.3049,0.676,3.9997,1.0342,0.157,0.9145,0.0002,4.1189,4.2661,2.3297,5.1096,5.6893,2.8114,1.5704,2.3211,0.6181,0.0298,5.2093,2.4082,5.3435,1.2868,4.0841,0.4228,2.1029,2.0573,0.0529,0.6619,1.5201,0.2445,4.458,1.2156,1.5147,0.7326,1.628,0.0002,4.3287,6.131,1.9716,0.2172,3.3307,0.0561,0.0071,8.7407,1.7509,6.1577,0.0006,4.3098,4.2563,0.8295,5.8881,1.1828,0.8073,0.9146,1.4835,0.6053,0.0332,4.639,6.2112,1.1855,2.425,0.0072,4.2438,2.0447,0.9778,4.5793,3.7449,1.3396,0.9354,5.0865,4.5364,3.6465,2.7212,1.8379,2.0369,4.0937,2.1872,5.6399,0.4149,3.5803,1.7015,2.8992,6.2516,2.9184,2.0843,4.8447,0.0216,2.5054,0.909,3.0237,1.1192,0.4542,0.7535,0.0002,3.619,1.3114,0.6226,0.2492,0.906,1.3648,0.0935,0.015,2.6726,4.2285,2.0224,4.4745,1.911,0.9856,5.6813,1.3982,1.0433,2.1046,0.169,0.0133,3.9918,3.8885,3.7732,5.4835,1.4827,2.0341,0.9782,1.625,1.1827,3.4088,0.9183,5.7878,3.9852,3.6247,0.1129,1.6736,1.5604,4.4987,1.5039,0.8754,3.884,0.069,2.3715,3.6988,5.4928,2.6087,1.0365,7.9059,1.4884,0.9644,0.0002,4.5014,0.8261,3.8118,4.5885,0.3681,1.9685,1.7393,4.1473,0.49,6.892,0.9801,3.3283,4.6867,2.197,0.3852,0.2079,1.147,3.2963,2.3969,3.0672,0.513,4.4944,1.4374,7.8818,1.1337,3.7409,5.222,4.276,3.3286,5.4287,5.6445,4.3669,6.9859,2.2538,5.0426,1.9714,5.0036,4.074,7.3773,0.4902,3.1389,4.0987,3.5174,4.2977,0.2752,4.4236,0.7078,1.2022,3.6169,3.0234,2.1379,1.1858,2.0889,2.3139,0.0082,4.9253,0.4379]}

This genocide is described as the \"genocide of white people\" according to U.S. officials. \"An ethnical cleansing\" that also includes use of \"black\" as a color and \"black and blue\" as both a sex and a religion.\n\nIn August 2012, a jury in Charleston County, WV, decided that the blue stripes should be removed only for use as a separate color for the WV State flag. The state appealed, and the jury reached a conclusion where both the striped stripes were removed for \"sick people\" and the white stripes are considered an appropriate background.\n\nIn January 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that the stripes of the blue and yellow stripes are acceptable but also that they cannot be considered \"civil rights\" to allow the removal of the white stripes from both the blue and yellow stripes.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n White stripes by the US Army National Guard, State Division of Civil Justice, Office

Principe Amedeo carried hers in her head, and Palestine Roamin da Silva carried her in a cloak to protect her against incoming enemy raids.\n\nBattles between two factions of Gaza-Palestine, the fighting is ongoing since 2006. Hamas has sought to establish controlled territory west of the border with Israel since 1993, and the Iron Dome missile defense system has been deployed there for protection purposes and has been a major target during Hamas\u2019 attacks and strikes along the border between Gaza and Israel. On October 3, Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack on the Israeli Embassy in Jerusalem, which killed 13 Palestinian soldiers and Israeli policemen.\n\nAnother incident last October occurred as Palestinian prisoners of war were released at the Israeli-controlled Gaza border, which was shut down a few days after the attack. Hamas also claimed responsibility for the massacre in the West Bank and that of IDF troops in Gaza. In that incident, soldiers in Gaza who were trying to enter the West Bank occupied Palestinian territory were killed in a firefight by a rocket fired by Hamas\u2019 troops. Both shootings left 13 Israelis and nine Palestinians dead, including eight Israeli soldiers, according to the army\u2019s official account,\n\n\u2018We saw a lot of Palestinian prisoners of war being freed as soon as it allowed.\u2019\n\nIn fact, Hamas has claimed that this act of revenge is motivated by \u2018ethnic cleansing\u2019, but Israel has vehemently denied these claims. Recently, the Israeli media had expressed concern about both Hamas-Hamas attacks and the targeting of Palestinian prisoners of war as Israeli Arabs are \u2018desperate to flee\u2019 to take revenge.\n\nIsraeli media has reported on some of Palestinian prisoners of war facing \u2018ethnic cleansing\u2019. One of the prisoners, who is Jewish, reportedly claimed that the \u2018Palestinian prisoners of war, who are of Jewish heritage, see the violence as an invasion\u2019. Another prisoner, who is Palestinian, claimed that Israelis do not want to be forced to leave their fields of death. The Palestinian prisoners of war reportedly want to flee to South Africa where they will be taken back through the border.\n\nThe Israeli regime is in an extremely difficult and precarious position, faced with an increasing degree of autonomy it can only hope to ensure it continues at this level, and a Palestinian Authority leader has said that Israel cannot afford to be forced out of Gaza and any solution that can come from the Palestinian Authority will require further negotiations.","token_len":536,"entropy":[7.4286,4.2246,10.9045,1.4532,0.0002,7.4252,5.5718,2.3836,1.7857,4.0932,3.3009,7.8343,1.3006,3.7053,10.1176,6.7527,0.9277,5.7084,6.4215,9.7655,5.0578,14.7643,2.7513,1.1791,4.7656,1.5613,6.3417,2.1403,0.8888,5.7149,5.3633,2.2368,2.3178,7.2136,0.5734,6.9523,0.0121,0.0004,0.1665,0.002,0.0022,0.0013,4.1404,11.0398,2.5092,1.5497,6.3828,1.164,1.7504,12.0617,10.0377,9.1326,8.3725,2.462,1.1869,1.5857,0.6172,3.3262,5.6687,4.3815,1.2841,0.5715,4.3888,5.1224,3.693,8.1433,0.3143,1.4791,0.0361,4.9904,2.9325,0.7586,4.0269,4.177,3.913,2.3611,8.844,5.0273,5.4573,0.0004,3.5002,2.7962,7.2246,4.5408,3.441,4.3591,5.3959,0.7971,4.3871,2.2782,5.9025,0.3341,3.164,7.9427,1.2586,6.3488,0.0794,0.6639,1.8335,1.362,0.2751,4.1808,5.1756,0.8421,1.2881,2.3547,8.3617,0.0062,1.9864,0.7773,0.0286,1.0448,1.0114,1.4342,3.6998,2.1774,5.2094,5.0418,4.8774,2.2733,1.3862,3.5257,1.2957,3.4661,4.367,3.9707,16.442,7.0371,2.9375,4.4788,4.4486,7.118,0.5204,1.1112,2.8431,1.7002,0.1058,0.2945,0.3249,4.6722,3.5086,3.4482,0.2312,2.5408,3.1514,0.4579,0.0298,1.599,2.273,0.8078,1.2933,2.2133,3.3973,0.2694,2.7498,1.0276,2.0761,0.9921,5.2082,4.2064,2.5614,1.1571,6.84,3.8723,0.3929,1.2634,0.0002,6.6335,3.467,5.4291,3.8693,1.4929,4.722,4.2353,6.6604,1.8081,0.1589,1.1525,3.0734,4.943,1.097,3.1597,2.1577,2.1968,3.0126,1.0834,1.8647,2.8163,1.9916,5.4331,0.5164,5.2508,1.6212,0.5867,2.8708,1.0663,2.3509,0.5936,3.5796,3.5889,1.1229,0.0782,0.0876,0.6873,4.7999,2.8826,2.1134,2.3424,0.0062,3.309,5.8886,1.709,7.3019,3.2277,1.6083,2.3562,1.0484,3.0576,4.0792,0.5559,0.1522,5.131,3.2369,2.2732,4.2211,0.9624,4.104,0.0012,2.4954,1.4727,1.0753,0.0008,5.1563,3.6599,0.4521,0.7824,1.9968,2.9044,1.5403,1.9592,0.0159,3.4607,3.0269,3.4768,1.1267,1.6148,0.4824,5.5409,0.0262,7.5014,0.411,5.1996,5.9697,4.7338,3.8854,3.3163,1.5437,4.3696,0.7895,0.9695,1.5363,0.8418,4.1593,3.476,0.7523,1.6326,2.948,0.0012,1.1761,5.19,6.212,0.015,2.7413,2.1423,1.0722,3.2587,7.4806,0.0002,4.5197,4.7926,7.3542,4.9464,2.1004,2.1197,0.0561,4.952,3.0435,0.4596,0.0031,2.3532,3.4036,4.4854,3.4615,0.0047,4.3205,8.2993,3.6452,5.474,0.4526,1.179,0.0002,2.6184,5.2233,0.0324,3.037,1.7826,3.2109,1.9454,4.3365,5.0507,0.6005,4.5114,1.7558,4.6794,0.1618,12.3067,0.7627,8.4052,0.2121,0.2236,0.1676,2.5118,2.8489,4.2601,1.4186,5.1147,0.0506,3.3754,0.362,0.3857,6.2009,0.1537,1.6861,1.6321,4.6417,4.3908,5.758,1.5987,1.2015,5.9032,3.2087,4.6415,2.8862,0.0022,3.8818,0.5029,1.0653,6.4913,0.0431,2.1771,2.3196,0.2344,0.0077,3.521,6.2683,7.0881,2.4376,11.8248,0.1341,7.7341,1.2675,1.0812,4.6895,5.7238,0.2429,2.7804,5.6611,4.3694,2.2818,0.7498,0.0002,5.2408,2.8376,2.9802,2.1039,1.545,4.6942,0.6308,6.3219,0.7428,0.1142,0.0044,7.1053,7.8704,0.0265,3.3051,0.0038,0.2018,0.0396,1.7785,3.601,1.3934,0.8595,4.0524,1.9373,3.382,1.7832,5.3428,0.1856,4.573,4.0345,0.5109,2.3644,7.7517,0.0701,3.0892,1.2958,0.4183,0.0047,4.0397,1.1736,1.0176,4.5333,3.1125,3.3585,0.1845,7.5588,2.068,4.5619,1.1611,2.128,5.4854,2.5238,0.064,3.1266,2.4023,1.1692,0.7993,0.6443,0.5082,1.3435,0.1476,1.3121,0.1775,6.1401,4.7627,0.0406,2.0756,0.5506,3.419,4.6015,0.2955,1.9634,0.7123,9.1364,1.8929,6.9972,1.8772,2.6859,1.7952,1.7903,0.3286,0.008,5.2917,4.2944,0.2855,4.1912,0.7216,6.3437,1.412,3.3922,0.3016,1.2023,1.1001,5.2716,2.7271,6.951,1.3595,3.7815,1.4481,0.6084,0.0002,2.3114,2.3879,4.9925,2.4239,4.1303,3.5252,2.0757,1.1175,6.6908,4.3119,0.4535,2.2274,5.5978,0.2199,2.6653,2.8228,5.6307,0.0006,5.6058,8.5576,3.2011,2.3583,3.2607,0.1764,5.5603,4.6586,3.6511,7.3947,2.1374,2.2058,2.9193,1.7952,4.5166,4.4919,2.9445,5.3405,2.3356,2.4721,0.3907,3.5533,2.98,2.1323,0.1983,3.0758,3.2295,3.545,0.4202,1.7273,2.5008,5.7269,6.8208,2.6267,3.7728,4.5511,0.2308,1.1358,0.8674,0.2544,1.7624,2.1179,5.6577,2.6759,0.7888]}

{"id":3628,"ended":true,"length":487,"text":"The bigeye thresher has larger teeth than other threshers and feeds on a wider variety of prey. Known food items include schooling forage fish such as mackerel and herring, benthic fishes such as coral reef shrimp, and marine benthic fish such as a shrimp tank and an oyster shell. The black thresher is a small fish with narrow teeth, but with the largest mouth possible it feeds on an array of different food items. It also has a good tendency to ripen and feed on fish which will leave it in great abundance, however the body is capable of producing far more fish than if the body could not be bothered to look for nutrients. The black thresher offers only a small bite if you feed on it but the fish will feast and develop a deep gut feeling in the water. The benthic fish can be fed to live at 50 degrees C (100\u00b0F) with minimal change to the body temperature due to the fluid in the mouth and in the body itself, the red and blue fish are both small fish but if they are fed in small amounts then they need to be fed more often. The white fish are mostly eaten because of their blue and yellow color which have an unpleasant and tasteless taste to them and it\u2019s also quite popular among Baja fishers where they enjoy them the most\n\nBlack Threshers\n\nIn addition to this type of Black Thresher it contains a broad range of smaller food items that can be consumed on a wide variety of occasions: small fish like prawns, shrimp, mackerel, cories, as well as many more species.\n\nThey generally come in different sizes and colors depending on the season. The fish usually eat from the beginning to the end of each month, and the food will be more or less constant depending on the season and the size of the fish. Depending on the species it takes until the end of the month to catch all the fish, the length of the season can vary depending of the time of day, the fish it eats will remain in a tank, or they may become more specialized to eat more fish than once upon a time, and the food usually comes from one area or another.\n\nA blackThresher is not only a big piece of fish but also a great source of food. Due to its wide range of textures and colour, it\u2019s very easy to create an elegant fish at any level, and a fish that can be found on many beaches across Baja California and elsewhere should not be overlooked. Furthermore, it is a good choice for every family.","token_len":536,"entropy":[7.0076,12.6282,10.424,5.0557,1.5682,4.2188,9.399,3.8463,1.6301,4.3664,2.7158,0.238,0.3355,1.9019,7.4455,0.5517,3.5432,5.0223,0.8764,0.0049,2.0448,1.2094,7.5616,7.4457,4.5388,0.1083,12.5786,5.293,6.3103,4.6071,2.9442,0.0014,4.2727,0.0489,0.001,1.5444,5.7422,0.0621,0.681,5.8856,3.6701,0.1347,4.145,0.1751,0.0011,5.9115,1.8637,3.7116,0.5916,1.3672,4.6789,5.1423,0.5266,0.1474,1.4692,0.1286,0.0009,5.4234,6.1838,7.605,2.3843,4.7188,2.7599,0.0089,2.3254,0.3636,2.533,5.6637,3.8968,0.0821,0.0291,1.9053,2.2709,3.6299,1.96,1.4734,6.5042,3.1753,2.0164,2.54,4.3275,3.3407,1.9337,2.844,6.3115,2.451,2.3968,0.4089,4.2708,3.3246,0.0007,3.4478,2.8921,0.8896,1.2042,2.4352,2.5429,1.4805,1.0471,6.0288,6.1005,0.1162,6.9866,0.443,2.4215,4.8455,0.6066,3.6668,4.2865,4.0071,5.7869,1.7942,2.9903,4.8607,7.0361,3.2932,4.8739,2.883,5.6004,2.2072,6.2128,0.012,2.5924,4.7181,0.5068,4.2706,0.7012,5.8009,2.016,2.6205,4.9188,1.7371,2.472,7.0616,0.6189,5.0277,1.6622,6.5194,0.4319,1.9852,1.4218,0.2232,0.0093,0.0049,7.8004,4.8368,1.1843,1.7132,4.5944,5.2011,2.8115,3.4948,1.7972,1.4633,4.1917,3.0527,5.4999,0.9649,6.5734,3.5055,5.7756,1.4307,5.562,5.3216,2.9804,4.1929,1.1429,4.5943,0.5782,1.7446,5.7841,0.1655,0.0075,0.8499,3.1051,1.1976,5.2577,4.4595,5.7986,6.4419,6.7624,3.6448,2.1024,3.1101,3.9058,2.6648,1.4302,0.5639,3.379,4.6399,5.2622,2.3428,1.192,3.1196,0.2771,5.0507,0.0049,1.0081,7.5106,1.8208,0.2588,3.6216,2.0685,4.9881,0.5561,3.2856,3.7617,3.0837,2.6889,5.394,3.2016,2.9131,4.317,2.1835,5.028,4.9005,2.4422,2.9318,5.2224,2.3967,1.1405,1.1519,3.5108,3.5507,0.9261,2.976,0.8748,5.7384,0.6596,0.5144,1.4755,3.2625,1.6233,0.9691,1.2553,3.3106,1.5003,1.3982,5.4748,3.9188,5.5036,1.83,0.8288,5.3795,2.7205,2.0058,1.2404,4.4289,4.678,3.7434,3.8952,4.4757,5.7412,0.0281,0.699,2.7143,0.2021,2.8747,3.5151,16.9009,7.8058,3.3317,2.9433,4.2365,4.874,2.7045,7.4642,5.6286,8.101,0.0914,5.3081,0.9933,5.6738,5.9606,6.1925,0.5944,5.8428,0.0268,5.5217,2.0131,0.0115,0.6757,3.0122,0.0002,4.1169,3.7603,0.0512,5.1543,4.8954,0.0261,6.0035,0.4077,0.0095,0.2621,3.3889,5.513,1.6955,5.6383,1.4598,0.0027,4.9087,5.3755,0.2298,2.8205,1.8181,0.5739,2.7399,3.4575,1.0167,4.6711,0.7213,0.0045,0.8134,4.7046,4.7207,1.657,2.9109,5.2984,0.3629,0.1193,0.3525,2.763,0.4737,3.4543,0.0021,0.0005,0.4535,3.6253,12.1788,0.3171,5.8853,3.0765,0.0029,3.6727,2.7385,3.7531,2.8347,2.0456,0.0002,5.0302,5.4106,3.9892,0.2165,3.1078,0.7509,1.2947,3.4308,1.4631,0.0587,0.7414,2.1272,1.3968,2.0122,4.9404,3.3605,4.2272,4.7473,2.1568,5.881,2.3478,0.7799,0.2204,0.1076,4.5774,1.975,1.6836,2.8087,2.551,3.821,3.6408,1.7068,4.7811,1.4945,0.0008,5.4409,4.8686,0.0456,0.375,0.8338,2.1378,1.1046,2.9639,0.1777,0.1629,0.5551,0.321,5.979,0.0331,0.2657,3.1622,3.3984,5.345,6.7028,0.9384,1.6137,0.0111,0.4277,1.2748,1.4519,3.7097,4.1972,0.707,1.0981,1.5924,2.183,5.2952,0.4292,0.6195,2.3269,1.9196,0.6013,2.392,6.7547,0.5011,3.692,0.2908,2.8582,1.6709,1.2415,3.4711,4.8415,0.9794,3.6355,5.8142,1.5688,2.7244,3.9108,1.8768,1.7894,2.9644,1.3012,4.2404,4.2459,6.6987,3.8129,2.6434,3.3103,2.1574,2.6206,5.3248,7.5849,0.5943,0.8281,2.5703,2.2661,1.8893,3.0543,5.516,3.1086,0.8623,4.3939,5.3176,2.0205,1.6513,0.5458,0.997,0.0001,3.9444,2.5619,7.831,0.0564,0.001,1.327,3.4506,2.8542,1.0841,3.3518,8.0731,0.0396,1.6197,1.0563,0.8159,0.6349,2.5492,3.0677,0.0243,1.7617,1.4989,5.7808,0.0023,0.7372,3.8071,2.1724,0.5703,7.7619,1.0911,3.3282,1.3598,0.9009,11.9827,0.0842,0.0091,2.773,2.3684,0.1241,5.7698,2.3525,5.6966,4.5234,6.8072,3.1154,4.6005,2.2631,1.4723,3.5459,4.2209,0.9878,1.6186,0.8627,3.51,2.5206,2.5366,3.0886,4.9255,3.8965,0.0012,3.4416,2.7975,3.5522,6.0783,1.858,0.2508,1.7833,0.3682,6.9979,0.5893,1.621,0.9081,1.8798,2.5222,2.6188,0.4173,6.4027,4.5559,3.2018]}
{"id":880,"ended":true,"length":504,"text":"On 7 November 1956, the Heron LN @ - @ < unk > Lars crashed at Hummelfjell after the aircraft had experienced icing problems. The Hummelfjell Accident killed the pilot and one passenger, one of the crew, and one of the aircraft in a separate crashed out of the sky crash. The other two, who were a passenger and an officer on-board, were in the vehicle and the crash killed four people including the pilot.\n\nOne day after the crash we lost the pilot to firefighting. It was a very sad loss to us and we will miss Lars.\n\nLars on 7 December 1956:\n\nOn 28 December 1956 Lars and his two colleagues were about to go into an overnight flight on board a commercial airliner that had crashed in the mountains. Lars was flying as he was returning to the town of Bonn from work at the time of the incident. As we were heading towards a coffee shop near the town when we heard a bang and saw the plane crashing at the edge of the mountain. At this point I asked Lars if I could help. He said that I could help myself to a bag of coffee and a drink. Unfortunately, it had been lost on the road back and I could not return. At this point the other passengers in the helicopter went out on their own and the pilot, Lars went home. I was in the taxi as we were heading towards Bonn and my colleague was at home. On the way to the airport I could not save a flying friend of Lars but I still managed to get him into the hospital for treatment of an eye injury. My colleague who was at the hospital was lying at the front of the ambulance and the emergency services arrived shortly after.\n\nLars and I were the last of the staff to take the pilot out of the ambulance while I had been waiting at the airport. As we arrived I knew that the plane had crashed and we all saw the plane crash on the mountain. When I looked up the road I was surprised of the extent of the damage. At this point I thought that Lars was dead.\n\nLars and my wife were at the airport as I was driving. They said that he had taken some medical precautions for the pilot and he could be admitted to the hospital for an overnight stay.\n\nThe next day Lars was sitting in the driver's seat of the ambulance.

{"id":1929,"ended":false,"length":412,"text":"Research on Iguanodon decreased during the early part of the 20th century as World Wars and the Great Depression enveloped Europe. A new species that would become the subject of much study and taxonomic discussion has been identified as Iguanodon. The species has a long life and is native to the Indian Ocean, Western Europe and the Middle East. It is a family of the common shark that is characterized by deep blue coloration on its abdomen and dorsal fin. It is a distinctive feature on the body and tail. It is described as being around 6 feet and 3 inches long. The species has a red color and is described as being between 3 feet and 3\u00a0inches long. The shark also possesses two distinct dorsal fins, which are slightly blackish but often orange in color and are a distinct color as well. These two dorsal fins are colorblind; in other words, the shark retains the ability to see through the fin during its dorsal period.\n\nSpecies\n\nThe species Iguanodon is known to have two species, both of which are recognized as species of Iguanodon. The species known to have two species, both of which are recognized as species of Iguanodon, is Iguanodon.  Both species possess the same color as described above.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\nKoehler, N. & Iguanodon. J. Aquaculture.

Alabama opened a 21 \u2013 0 lead on Alabama on the next play from scrimmage. The first two Crimson Tide points came on special teams, scoring on an 85-yard punt return from safety Dez Bryant out of the end zone as time expired. But Alabama did get on top of the Tide, scoring on a 3-point play from the 1 for a 38-29 lead entering the locker room and with Alabama out of the game with 2:01 and 6 seconds left.\nOn one play from scrimmage, Alabama put the Tide up 7-0 before the Tigers caught up with the defense. The second half was not as interesting as usual as teams have been to this point. Alabama scored one yard on six plays, but a field goal just before halftime pushed a 28-17 Alabama lead to a 41-24 mark in the final minutes.\nIt felt like the most exciting game of the season. The game started with the Alabama-Texas game and went into overtime. On third down in the fourth quarter, Auburn took over and had their first first down and a 41-yard touchdown pass cut into the Alabama 42-21 lead. On the first play from scrimmage, the Tigers went for a field goal but a pass interference from quarterback J.T. Barrett. That was where Auburn took the lead for good with just one more play being called when Auburn linebacker Michael Floyd was flagged for a penalty. But the game went back to the same game and this time the Tigers needed a little bit of that kick-pass interference.\nThe second half didn't have the same feel. Auburn looked to be the match, and Alabama seemed to be taking too much of the game. The Tigers went into the third quarter with a 14-6 lead, and Auburn found itself in reverse as the Crimson Tide put up another score and took the lead for good. Auburn found itself 16-12 for the game, but now they have a chance to earn a berth in the national tournament next month when their opponent, TCU, plays at Alabama. Auburn got everything it needed to win on three of its first four possessions during overtime. No teams are scheduled to participate in any national tournaments.\nThe Alabama win is definitely a major step for the Tigers. If they had beaten Baylor four years ago with an 8-7 record they would be a step in the right direction. In a season that has seen many college football teams finish with a win or eight in a row, this will be the type of victory that Alabama will be looking for next season.","token_len":538,"entropy":[2.6222,10.2341,1.7215,3.1181,0.3552,0.8436,8.252,4.789,0.4953,1.5492,8.191,1.4302,5.8285,0.9634,4.4887,16.2575,8.4153,8.0411,7.9075,0.6051,0.6933,3.8522,1.4017,6.2633,0.0009,3.3718,7.8206,2.9307,1.1712,5.8067,6.1528,3.6298,4.3137,1.0963,4.7182,1.5605,2.8048,4.228,5.6971,2.1048,3.0981,0.7922,5.0378,1.4405,0.7979,1.7098,4.7354,3.7973,5.2088,0.0083,3.5045,0.9532,0.8833,5.7987,0.0057,1.3642,6.1421,1.7181,3.7683,5.2682,0.7034,0.0035,3.4155,0.0812,2.8336,5.1848,4.6313,4.1982,0.8343,7.7602,0.2357,0.7564,0.8835,0.0492,4.9381,1.1942,0.0264,0.3504,5.0017,3.1352,4.3426,4.2891,4.2887,3.5609,1.7669,0.8801,1.559,2.2384,2.4317,0.8175,0.6957,4.1388,0.9263,5.1416,2.9847,1.1803,2.8412,4.4485,6.8854,3.3768,3.8059,0.1396,4.8319,0.9094,8.7185,0.0761,6.4563,0.0116,4.1408,4.8739,5.3869,3.5807,0.7134,0.4568,0.3979,4.2032,3.9331,0.3903,4.0077,7.6626,3.731,2.0193,0.2277,1.2776,1.3776,10.3276,5.4193,0.4396,2.7631,0.3342,0.201,1.9619,5.2405,1.5914,3.191,1.7808,6.178,0.5381,1.0957,4.0045,2.1645,4.9326,5.3489,1.8398,1.7311,0.9933,3.8191,1.7773,1.9453,3.9648,2.0465,1.9409,4.4132,1.4923,4.8109,0.5127,4.5456,2.0175,6.8026,4.4101,1.2829,4.771,3.1145,0.0551,1.2747,2.1989,3.8544,4.9779,6.4213,0.7519,4.7213,1.4406,1.488,1.6362,4.3941,3.819,0.0048,5.6655,1.9577,0.8113,5.669,4.6856,5.1998,0.2909,3.3415,3.8574,0.2606,0.4872,3.6133,6.1279,0.1262,3.2542,7.1921,3.7654,0.1761,2.321,2.9403,0.6194,1.253,4.033,5.497,0.4142,1.4248,4.4828,2.0183,1.0151,0.3436,0.3412,0.828,1.827,1.7795,3.1239,3.0178,1.4413,2.1128,4.0315,4.3546,4.8279,1.7342,2.0733,3.3784,2.3384,1.2298,1.0737,3.7744,3.6516,0.5052,3.9104,0.0876,1.9905,0.067,0.1723,3.4158,3.5339,2.3625,1.9537,3.6707,5.0772,1.2137,6.1723,2.0395,5.0765,2.0595,4.7887,0.0764,1.2264,2.318,1.3619,8.7503,5.1268,0.3031,2.3968,4.539,0.9122,3.3278,0.4288,0.3282,2.7421,1.1624,4.0581,1.2626,2.1374,0.1189,0.1465,1.6786,2.2135,3.2155,2.6203,0.6486,1.6311,0.0086,3.3636,3.3809,4.1013,2.18,5.2751,3.8379,3.9291,0.8174,1.1972,0.0086,0.1346,5.7049,4.1701,2.2257,5.9862,3.5376,3.403,1.5721,0.6229,3.1102,0.2328,3.5943,3.369,3.2899,3.8046,1.4457,6.2732,1.9144,5.6369,4.4248,5.2721,4.9092,6.0839,2.4157,2.1439,0.1967,1.1935,4.9591,1.3368,4.1681,1.5382,2.9966,2.1676,4.4717,0.4536,1.0367,4.3543,3.7219,2.2067,4.6202,0.1503,1.2714,2.164,5.6338,1.5615,5.1573,3.1217,0.962,5.3924,5.7452,4.1277,3.3595,1.9503,1.7034,1.4936,1.5825,2.7039,1.0989,5.3617,0.0008,3.009,2.0449,0.9389,5.0652,2.0163,2.5022,5.2112,1.2019,1.4598,3.7311,8.0716,4.9632,2.6761,3.3723,5.5905,0.2826,1.2324,3.6636,5.4013,0.9433,1.0533,1.1918,3.8998,1.5803,1.7415,2.712,3.2579,2.5552,0.7665,2.8001,0.1294,1.1275,1.0577,3.7974,0.8954,2.7309,0.1799,1.8676,1.4484,4.3081,4.9635,1.8449,1.7715,8.1375,3.1124,1.0003,3.0669,0.0008,4.7086,1.1582,4.9038,3.5061,3.4206,3.5421,1.436,0.2184,2.7048,0.0092,0.6049,3.856,5.126,1.9943,7.0267,0.4765,3.758,4.7115,0.3828,0.5681,1.3878,0.9445,6.8737,2.3027,3.4939,1.9357,2.5842,0.1411,6.179,0.9756,6.4184,0.6068,0.1035,3.974,6.348,4.7926,2.6503,4.0529,4.3996,3.1235,1.1625,4.8982,0.4379,2.4731,2.8608,3.3342,1.1111,4.0292,4.8037,7.8977,2.1874,0.8364,0.7144,1.495,3.9637,5.1804,3.0466,1.6019,1.0798,0.6503,0.7613,6.1991,4.2881,0.8103,6.3812,5.3973,3.4713,6.7595,0.0769,4.8817,0.202,4.8374,4.7103,2.6217,2.5149,0.6445,1.6111,4.0045,3.8029,3.1354,5.0886,1.2281,4.0316,3.5045,2.3689,0.6121,1.5072,1.2304,4.1456,0.9331,5.1596,4.2125,3.9987,6.2001,1.2919,0.0518,4.8934,3.2352,2.4351,0.389,2.1956,0.8055,4.4243,0.2917,1.9117,3.0592,5.61,2.5787,0.0323,0.0766,0.0017,0.8604,4.4151,3.2163,3.3697,1.6752,1.3799,1.0799,3.6937,5.0137,0.6016,0.9005,3.5033,1.8497,1.7024,3.8068,2.2005,7.95,3.0939,1.2029,0.0137,0.4518,1.5927,3.8562,0.3533,1.7171,5.7943,0.0068,2.7099,0.8126,3.2633,2.053,1.9667,1.4361,0.6612,4.9178,1.2255,0.083]}

{"id":1655,"ended":false,"length":507,"text":"Warren was an outspoken critic of accusations that the island's girls had been sexually abused when young, and the prosecution of a selected number of Pitcairn's male residents. She claimed that she 'loudly cried out for protection... and she was so horrified by this, that she didn't stop crying, and she made a statement.'\nWarren, who ran the Liberal Party as a member of New Zealand's parliament, had previously described the island's boys as 'tough-ass men'.\nBut she denied allegations that she had abused the boys.\n'I lied and kept up my word and I kept them, and they were safe. That's how I felt. And I did keep up my word,' she said.\n'I've apologized for it... She did. She never asked to have sex with me.

I was looking forward to this series. It's my job to make sure that we are not playing poorly,\" said Gatland. \"In terms of the quality of the team which has shown up on the tour team that have had the best of it, I know they have. There's not as much competition for places. The other teams are more good but that won't be here. There's going to be plenty of quality players off the field and there will be more focus and that is very big for our team.\"\nAs a result, Gatland has opted to make no selection changes to his 33-man squad for the series against New Zealand. A series of three-match ODI series in Australia would have brought together the four-time defending champions.\nOn his decision to replace Gatland, Warren Gatland said:\n\"I've always said that I would like to see how the team feels, the players feel, the teams perform. I think this series has been extremely successful and hopefully I can get a chance to show them that. I think that would be very important to me. Everyone can contribute and that is the important aspect of the match.\n\"It's important to get a chance to show the teams how each of the guys in the squad feels. It's not just me but it's anyone off of the team. We are the Test team, we are all Test players, we can all contribute. Having each player contribute is important. We definitely will need time to see the team play it now, then test it again. There hasn't been that much to do.\"\nGatland added: \"One of the things that we would like to do over the course of the series is to show to the team that it was really important to go out and play in front of our own fans, which they haven't seen us play. This series has got to be a test at the level that we want to come back and try and finish off the game.\n\"In the long term for me, I just am a person who can relate to the game and I think it's a great thing that I can share with this team.\"","token_len":543,"entropy":[7.0338,2.917,1.2692,9.2182,7.841,1.0942,7.9908,3.5137,8.505,14.3185,10.6652,3.635,7.4259,9.82,2.022,5.798,7.6955,4.2314,4.2472,3.6674,0.7641,7.1753,5.3362,1.7292,3.6085,0.0669,3.2307,8.4048,9.5206,3.0469,0.2565,6.6772,6.867,2.9845,2.6868,2.2468,4.3977,5.8866,5.5433,3.7638,1.3842,2.6838,2.1802,0.0003,0.0001,0.0002,0.0002,0.0011,4.5359,3.4527,4.1853,4.4128,3.7315,4.2372,4.0603,4.2242,4.1297,3.5555,0.1005,7.8128,2.2552,0.0349,7.9454,9.6163,0.0077,0.8796,2.1851,0.0014,11.4812,0.1579,11.0743,2.3723,8.2339,2.8509,4.503,3.5613,5.9945,1.8757,3.2199,0.0189,6.5441,0.4694,6.3246,2.6701,2.6233,0.3962,1.8728,3.9151,3.9778,6.1357,2.2558,0.8401,3.9348,1.5886,3.8252,7.0092,2.8733,0.5905,1.917,0.633,0.0035,2.8241,1.5374,2.0097,2.545,4.9439,0.0523,0.0189,3.5081,3.3655,3.0212,2.1703,2.0495,3.9502,4.2059,0.4333,2.5102,0.1226,1.399,1.8534,2.7807,3.6329,3.7217,4.8771,3.7186,1.741,1.2339,0.002,0.6328,2.4114,4.148,2.525,0.0012,1.4553,3.4438,0.1949,0.6042,2.4642,5.4072,2.9988,4.128,1.5566,3.0706,0.6833,2.8402,6.5012,4.5055,3.5487,4.099,2.0013,1.4127,3.4608,2.5471,1.0384,1.363,4.1982,2.5317,1.7814,3.1841,3.9888,1.7907,3.1554,4.3404,0.4664,3.917,3.0809,1.5109,2.9059,2.7019,4.8642,2.0294,1.4802,3.7358,4.471,3.1754,3.0877,5.3058,0.0003,1.3357,7.0043,1.8273,3.466,0.8607,3.2338,0.0023,0.0141,3.7874,0.1068,4.0821,2.8531,6.5371,0.2558,0.7644,2.2178,2.8696,1.6774,0.1389,3.6119,5.8089,2.9772,3.5253,2.7116,4.6878,6.3722,0.9007,2.9115,1.1582,1.0612,0.3786,5.3,2.8526,1.1566,1.0159,1.6522,0.0015,2.6656,4.6156,0.6229,4.102,4.2846,8.3521,3.0415,0.8916,1.5954,7.9362,0.8353,0.0805,0.5268,1.8979,0.696,3.9242,1.1731,1.1898,0.0017,0.8901,4.7755,4.9742,2.6459,4.3344,2.1463,1.0397,5.5997,0.003,0.0656,3.2821,3.1653,3.4799,2.2293,4.1685,4.8964,1.9242,4.0587,4.1541,2.0929,5.6427,1.1291,2.04,0.7726,4.5759,3.8962,5.0456,0.2629,5.3992,2.1198,0.001,0.8405,5.4769,0.185,0.0009,1.1125,0.6689,4.3368,0.1273,0.9742,2.459,2.6947,1.6097,0.8448,1.5595,2.4027,1.7041,0.1079,2.7387,6.2842,1.4191,2.1998,4.9209,2.7983,2.9286,1.9185,0.4182,1.3039,1.1645,5.0675,4.9332,0.9301,1.1512,1.7319,3.603,1.7615,2.4739,0.9289,4.5459,2.5927,1.6092,4.0913,2.5857,0.716,2.7189,2.1662,3.7925,0.1377,3.0605,2.2999,1.3856,1.9116,1.1812,1.5965,2.2531,4.4449,0.4077,2.6582,2.1192,1.4885,3.2088,1.3887,6.5601,4.0518,5.9586,1.5856,2.5102,1.8357,2.052,4.2899,4.5959,0.8689,1.4907,3.7522,1.0167,1.9798,0.1242,2.1401,0.6674,3.0806,1.0625,2.9391,1.917,1.4449,0.1802,2.2453,1.4261,3.535,2.1241,7.8516,2.6904,2.5286,3.5535,4.5929,0.6812,1.3261,1.3546,1.1293,2.0774,0.4513,2.2031,1.6702,3.9856,2.5748,3.4982,0.4131,6.8583,7.0458,4.5966,0.2747,1.7873,1.2735,2.4118,2.9436,3.788,5.7538,0.7371,2.0867,0.7636,0.6624,3.9521,1.6926,0.9742,1.6017,0.5758,4.4277,0.9955,1.7548,1.4578,6.4745,7.1014,2.5516,2.8887,1.7496,1.5692,1.5057,2.2831,7.0762,4.4346,4.0948,5.6007,0.5971,4.2421,2.4586,1.4263,2.8982,5.2646,6.8386,2.2507,3.9075,5.9846,0.5729,2.8442,1.6161,4.1185,5.865,0.0002,0.0177,3.5779,0.5783,4.6469,2.5748,4.3682,0.3724,1.6143,0.0068,0.0004,3.517,0.4594,0.5278,5.3765,0.6029,0.133,0.5424,0.9464,2.2686,4.4105,0.3558,0.0863,1.2611,6.0883,0.1264,2.3791,0.0006,0.3839,1.1749,0.2585,1.1267,3.5332,5.3359,0.4784,2.0983,0.9158,3.2111,4.4104,3.9124,1.535,0.9365,4.5008,1.7695,1.0111,0.9116,3.0903,2.6311,0.0367,3.2886,2.928,0.629,2.3042,3.8238,3.8632,4.5545,0.0004,1.1358,4.9028,0.8496,1.9936,3.9344,2.5138,1.3966,5.8925,0.4529,0.6474,1.7974,3.2579,6.1079,1.0454,5.6786,1.3134,0.8844,2.2937,0.5986,7.3958,3.3875,2.4254,4.2188,1.0017,4.9077,3.5092,1.0253,3.787,1.041,1.9156,0.015,4.2205,1.605,5.2424,1.159,6.1291,2.228,0.9675,1.0924,4.5869,6.9428,3.8338,4.9973,0.6033,3.3673,5.2664,0.1889,1.1916,3.4547,1.1296,1.7632,2.0626,1.6738,0.6032,2.4921,1.3745,2.6568,1.5176,2.8941,1.2747,5.3532,1.7061,4.3979,0.7037,2.0501]}
{"id":655,"ended":true,"length":480,"text":"Following Virginia Tech's kickoff, NC State returned the ball to the 27 @ - @ yard line, where the Wolfpack began the game's first play. That play was a short, one-yard bomb intended for RB Jalen Hurts, resulting into a 2 TD, 29 yard TD @ - 4:10. Here is an inside look at NC State's #1 receiver and \"playmaker\" \u2013 CB Jaylon Smith @ @ + + + \u2013 3:35. pic.twitter.com\/GJUq2kOeN \u2014 College Football Talk (@CollegeTalk) September 4, 2017\n\nThe Wolfpack's biggest gain occurred on two plays from the 7th quarter. One had a 1 yard gain that set up the 6th and 10th quarter to give them the lead to tie it. The second one occurred at the 1 yard line \u2014 and again, with just under a minute left to go.\n\nSmith finished the run in the 8th quarter with a 52 yard strike against North Carolina. It was our second 50 yard touchdown. That's a lot of touchdowns scored in that short of a time span.\n\nWith a good first series of plays, the Wolfpack took advantage of their own opportunities to drive toward the goal line. NC State took advantage of that. The Eagles managed to do just that as well.\n\nWith the 2nd quarter down, the Eagles hit a 38 yard field goal at the 9:07 mark. To this day, I want to say \u201cnever\u201d when talking about college football. I want to give credit to those guys for making the game so hard for the Wolfpack (and the national team).\n\nThere were certainly a few big plays by the Eagles, and a few by the Wolfpack. They also made a few mistakes that could have been made later in the game to open the game. These mistakes were all in the first half \u2014 and not all in the 2nd quarter \u2014 though they weren\u2019t as bad as some might have feared. No, it wasn\u2019t perfect.\n\nWe\u2019re not talking about turnovers. This was a football team that had one turnover in the first half \u2014 a little less than ideal \u2014 but what we\u2019re talking about was the team that played in front of their own fans \u2014 and they put up an offensive rating on it.\n\nIf you can\u2019t tell, we\u2019re going to try to talk about the game without giving away too much away. Here\u2019s hoping in a little bit more\u2026\n\nWhat do you think of the game? Let us know in the comments section here.","token_len":543,"entropy":[10.0265,2.8839,1.5859,7.7595,1.964,9.472,0.0646,6.1892,1.7564,0.6055,1.2954,1.7484,6.6825,14.2139,9.4921,6.4996,8.2774,0.7815,2.3637,3.4451,2.1976,5.7666,0.1049,5.5967,1.8474,2.8867,5.1321,2.4468,4.6008,0.8749,4.9511,2.9492,1.6027,2.2862,5.5286,2.6486,3.4535,0.0729,0.6463,5.8403,5.5333,0.272,5.5102,5.449,0.0151,2.9375,0.011,1.1405,7.1443,8.7997,0.5155,4.7322,7.0175,3.8713,5.753,4.4607,3.3124,10.2082,2.1456,5.3704,1.6468,3.5734,0.927,5.4179,1.4464,3.4709,4.5368,0.7831,0.2958,3.9698,0.0065,0.202,6.8017,1.8418,2.9943,3.8889,6.0503,5.4791,0.8468,0.6869,6.0557,4.7702,5.9478,0.6767,0.0793,6.0103,5.7907,5.0837,5.8817,4.0503,4.7556,4.4174,1.9948,3.7561,1.0546,2.8675,0.0008,0.0,0.0004,0.0001,0.0007,4.5761,3.9508,4.7324,3.4641,4.3374,4.2189,4.6425,4.2722,4.5141,8.5132,4.454,0.081,5.0305,0.033,0.3861,5.8965,0.4996,2.2075,3.5296,0.0002,0.5551,0.1427,0.0008,2.188,2.966,0.0106,3.4942,4.892,3.8368,6.0295,1.423,5.5466,1.1662,3.3204,0.7328,4.6091,2.322,1.4672,1.0687,5.0938,6.0829,1.9193,4.8296,1.2294,1.9627,4.3183,5.3707,0.1184,1.5892,5.3511,2.417,1.1135,2.9899,1.2385,3.3759,6.468,3.4814,2.7198,1.9756,1.1707,5.0602,3.6741,1.2397,3.0007,1.0895,1.5912,3.0803,6.3609,2.0544,1.2827,3.5526,2.9176,0.291,7.6593,3.2136,5.3901,1.1399,3.7415,4.1414,1.0655,1.9099,0.1455,0.9039,2.8045,2.8954,0.9483,1.2266,0.0003,6.321,4.2662,1.1956,5.432,4.1682,0.418,5.9796,0.1703,0.7242,0.8068,1.0251,4.9649,0.3522,6.6259,4.6941,4.3685,0.0474,1.7172,3.3474,0.4342,7.7545,2.8795,7.0431,0.247,2.7567,4.0123,4.4498,2.0643,1.7718,3.9186,0.2368,4.0563,6.2738,1.6267,3.8162,3.3319,5.0855,0.2679,3.1757,3.7873,0.4857,0.8438,0.0002,3.8329,2.9507,5.1337,3.811,8.3207,1.6426,2.3454,1.1218,1.7027,0.5814,0.0069,3.8758,2.3503,0.088,2.4829,3.4441,4.7353,1.1387,4.4798,6.5887,0.4266,3.7161,0.0698,0.6726,3.2449,0.0014,3.4431,1.4266,0.0743,3.157,3.3689,2.2249,5.1516,5.8271,0.4483,5.5519,1.2108,0.1715,4.1851,0.6774,1.1063,1.0598,0.0002,3.1303,1.8261,5.0632,0.1431,2.035,5.3473,1.2267,1.4527,0.7671,4.6359,1.4952,5.3704,0.205,1.1705,0.004,3.5772,0.4206,3.4692,0.493,4.5705,0.0419,0.9659,6.1474,3.9843,1.6009,0.1506,2.5685,6.9417,0.1719,2.2438,12.586,6.9753,7.1044,2.7855,9.6008,4.6544,3.1845,0.0604,6.8427,0.055,1.0229,2.54,2.817,0.3226,4.9888,2.6065,0.3134,4.6543,2.429,1.6322,2.5848,1.6522,3.333,3.093,5.0851,1.1979,1.8259,1.4695,0.0126,5.1244,0.6277,1.9354,4.9039,2.3201,1.2591,0.9983,0.0002,4.405,1.4155,5.3005,2.4788,0.5134,4.4616,0.1562,3.5698,1.0841,0.2894,2.1477,2.357,2.9555,0.9762,4.4385,0.8608,0.9905,0.0062,1.4695,3.0293,3.1822,3.1811,1.7383,1.5284,3.021,2.6401,3.151,0.282,1.2843,3.6258,5.7916,1.1594,0.0255,0.1605,4.8249,4.5012,1.1697,0.9699,1.2667,4.7732,2.7146,1.437,2.9651,3.2721,0.8412,1.4715,1.1594,5.3511,1.1888,3.7307,2.6428,2.4164,0.3217,3.7009,0.0068,2.1927,3.6519,4.288,2.5316,3.8031,12.6763,7.9813,1.77,2.6526,1.1048,0.2718,2.7182,2.3805,1.2136,3.6895,0.1042,6.8067,1.8762,2.6342,1.4638,1.5936,1.073,0.0155,4.854,0.5436,0.9866,0.0003,4.2936,6.1645,2.8934,1.1599,2.2766,1.3731,0.1956,5.9162,2.4879,3.4333,1.2548,1.1473,4.7862,2.2719,0.6995,2.4655,4.4569,1.9827,1.2648,0.8794,0.9752,0.4566,3.6871,2.7119,5.4214,3.054,0.0849,7.5124,2.84,1.8147,5.6909,1.7,1.9275,0.7006,0.4073,0.0688,0.005,1.3321,1.8985,4.3068,2.3982,4.3425,4.0777,3.8266,0.0244,2.6569,0.7088,0.5472,4.4525,1.3656,2.8708,4.9308,1.1997,3.3425,3.7906,3.4935,5.7046,3.4647,0.4696,1.2017,0.0002,4.2775,0.5846,4.2493,2.155,0.6139,0.0099,3.2559,1.8114,3.1775,3.4238,0.2801,0.1404,4.066,0.0476,4.3474,0.6564,2.2521,0.1653,2.1271,3.4388,5.1973,3.6234,1.5194,0.475,0.2876,4.7595,0.3094,4.0173,3.4686,0.264,1.897,9.1466,6.7244,3.7422,3.7931,0.9462,2.399,6.4195,0.3692,0.0002,4.5763,3.5829,0.2666,0.133,1.0218,0.9174,2.9347,0.7072,2.1004,0.2235,0.0043,0.3667,0.0164,0.0809,2.7711,6.2479,0.6645]}

{"id":6,"ended":false,"length":494,"text":"In 1924, the family moved into a four @ - @ level, semi @ - @ detached Victorian house at 23 The Waldrons. Barker had a studio built in the garden and had a private bathroom. She was a keen photographer, she had a collection of \"paintable\" watercolours, and used a small hand dryer in the summer, so she was well used \"to dry any image\".  Barker had a large collection of garden paints and used a specialised pencil to keep her work from fading, and she worked very slowly with hand dryers.\n\nBarker and her husband, James, opened their own shop, and her two daughters were also encouraged to create art by Barker.  Barker's other son, James, was a photographer and Barker often travelled to England as a photographer.  Barker died in 1970 at the age of 70 after a battle with Parkinson's disease.  Barker remained a teacher for much of her life and in many states the children would spend time with her in Birmingham, England where she was a pupil in the Museum of Modern Art.  Barker was very generous with her time in Britain. She was a patron of the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nIn 1941, Barker and her daughters, Julia, Anne and Anna, were awarded a prize from the Royal Society of Arts for her \"excellent\" work.  Barker had also worked as a photograph girl before leaving for England in the late 1930s.  Barker wrote the first memoir, The Lost Legacy of Edelbrock, and she was also an author of several novels and comics.  She was married to Bob Barker and they raised their daughter, Marie, in the United Kingdom.\n\nEdelbrock was a large British manufacturer and a renowned artist in British painting. They also produced several masterpieces and exhibitions in this country. Barker had worked to open the Tate house from 1924 to 1929 as well as others in London.  When Edelbrock came to Britain in 1929, the Tate was the scene of many exhibition exhibitions. She was the first British artist to exhibit at the Tate, alongside artists such as John Harkness and Robert J. B.

European competition in Europe. \"We were desperate to get on top of this,\" the Welsh giants told Sky Sports.\n\n\"We are working through different elements of competition, but are determined to bring our best into this place, and to give us the squad to do it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, fans will also be hoping for more of the likes of defender Marcelo Bielsa, midfielder Sam Allardyce and midfielder Andre Gomes to help to turn the tide for the Premier League at Old Trafford.\n\n\"I can say with certain certainty that Marcelo Bielsa has more than doubled his wages this season,\" said the club's general manager Ian Blackwood.\n\n\"But what we know about Marcelo Bielsa so far is that he's a very ambitious manager who can manage a good club.\"\n\nBut some hope will be lost as his long-term

beating the likes of Everton, Chelsea and Everton.\n\nThe United manager is expected to have a major role to play this year in deciding who else takes first place this term following last weekend's Europa League defeat.\n\n\"There are still plenty of areas to improve,\" Blackwood said, but said he was confident he could do more than see the points slip away now.\n\n\"We just have to be more focused and to do more things to win and get better at football.\"\n\nThe win over Wolverhampton Wanderers also showed he could be serious about joining the Red Devils at the start of the Premier

In 1845, there were eight passenger trains a day from Tunbridge Wells to London, with three times as many as the next day.\n\nBridgeton & Streat, the first two cars, will both be made of wood, with the first being of the largest and longest carriages. (Photo \u2013 Transport & Public Works Dept)\n\nThe third car will be the third to be built for \u00a3500,000 and the last will be set aside for \u00a3500,000, according to the planning application.\n\nOn one occasion, the carriages will be held up for auction by the car company which built them, but have had to be scrapped because the cars needed to be replaced to match those of the first cars.\n\nSydney City Council said that while the application was successful a request from the committee had to be made, but that it was rejected due to the lack of any suitable materials or construction.\n\nThe report stated that \u201cwhen the carriage was first laid up, they required a number of mechanical additions and additions, as had been applied to the first car and to the second carriage\u201d.\n\nThe committee also said that \u201cthe first car and second cars were, in fact, made as part of the first production schedule of their day trains\u201d.\n\nThe report stated that there were also various problems with the carriage and its operator Mr Wilson Wilson of the Transport & Public Works Department, but also explained that the carriage had to be brought back to Tunbridge Wells to be replaced.\n\nHe then added: \u201cThe carriage was also brought back in order that it could be used as part of the first production schedule of their day trains\u201d.\n\nCalls for the two cars to be scrapped\n\nSeveral attempts have been made to get the cars scrapped, with some council leaders calling for more stringent standards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to end the car industry,\u201d council leader John Tindall said, calling for a ban on the practice.\n\nCllr Andy Stewart, Councillor for Tunbridge Wells, said: \u201cThis means that the cars built for Tunbridge

{"id":2833,"ended":true,"length":529,"text":"As one of the largest open spaces close to Manchester, the moor has a history of use for army manoeuvres and large public gatherings. In his book The Condition of the Working Class, Ed Paine posits that the moor, in a landscape dominated by farmland, is the biggest open space \u2013 and its main concern has been safety. It is home to the largest concentration of army units at the end of the Second World War (4,500).\nThe main concern of the Moor is to keep it safe, and the protection of this vast area of land is one of the main reasons why the UK government was involved in negotiations with the European Union in 2014. Following the agreement of the Brexit Agreement, the deal was signed on 27 November 2014 in Brussels and was intended to bring a temporary change in EU regulations allowing for the use of the Moor as a public space. As the Moor became a battlefield during the Second World War we also worked closely with France, Germany, England, and Britain to protect against the invading military fleet that was deployed south of the Moor. The Moor was known to have been used for mass storage of weapons and ammunition during the first few months of the war and to have sustained use despite attacks on RAF bases by British commandos.\nThe Moor has also been used by the Royal Flying Corps in many terrorist incidents. During the Second World War it was used for large public marches. Due to the use of the Moor for fighting on a number of occasions terrorist targets were shot down. During last summer's terrorist attacks at the Moor, civilians were evacuated from the site by air ambulance.\nThe Moor was then a defensive site by the government. The Government agreed in early 2014 to provide the Moor with a new perimeter around the grounds. They also promised access into the Moor in the event of a major collision to land, and to continue providing access to the Moor until the end of the war. This arrangement was made particularly clear by the Government on 15 August 2014.\nThis arrangement will remain in place until August 2020, and the Moor will become a free zone once it is evacuated.\nThe following month, the Moor was also temporarily closed to the public as part of the Government's response to the First World War. The Moor is now used by the Army to store arms and ammunition. On July 23 2019 it was reopened to the public after a refurbishment.\nOn March 21, 2020 a total of 5,521 homes were evacuated from the Moor for safe removal from the Wounded Warrior Project. The Moor has an extensive community of veterans and those with special needs for the area and several communities. In the next few months we hope that the Moor will soon experience a return to full security.","token_len":547,"entropy":[5.4146,1.3522,0.6006,4.3833,7.2147,5.1972,10.7384,0.0841,7.8669,1.0647,1.6869,8.5626,3.1503,4.2487,2.2707,4.2406,0.302,5.7378,1.9904,10.0972,9.6102,0.0913,1.3336,6.3771,5.27,1.6849,0.5159,3.3744,5.8186,1.8868,2.2497,10.045,0.2283,1.1628,7.7015,0.6492,1.0059,6.6538,6.8222,4.8116,7.0782,0.0777,0.5436,1.318,2.4027,0.0012,3.6556,3.213,3.6213,7.5478,2.0369,0.0208,6.6709,0.7112,1.4604,2.4218,5.7881,1.7668,0.0719,7.1211,1.7915,4.3146,5.2312,5.3884,4.3094,0.6399,5.8707,0.3606,3.7486,0.9281,3.8998,0.0235,2.1289,2.9947,2.9709,0.0186,6.0492,3.7648,3.9304,1.4364,2.3693,0.0145,0.5835,3.1806,0.0074,0.0009,4.0856,5.7835,0.2,2.1141,3.1584,1.1512,11.6635,3.7017,4.5675,0.7351,0.5803,7.6499,1.0713,2.141,2.4022,4.3174,1.7657,1.8424,2.2549,2.6067,7.4746,0.3698,4.7942,5.2737,1.8598,2.5229,0.3635,0.9412,3.482,0.1103,0.2767,1.6259,2.34,0.8991,1.214,4.4782,1.7263,4.2494,4.5443,0.1292,4.43,1.209,0.6562,3.5693,0.2891,1.9197,5.0118,0.9286,5.7952,0.7343,5.3764,3.53,0.6043,8.5717,5.6307,0.81,0.915,7.9564,1.9318,2.1366,2.4249,3.2802,2.968,2.7548,3.5008,0.9429,2.2043,3.0021,5.6223,0.0736,3.972,2.4537,4.3881,6.1398,0.7304,3.7614,3.8888,4.7414,1.7039,1.0353,3.0522,0.0222,1.8414,2.9524,2.1228,0.3567,3.529,1.8708,0.4606,4.3756,1.9309,2.247,3.67,1.1149,6.6163,3.9561,0.3159,1.2796,0.0026,0.0003,8.8043,4.6772,7.8203,1.6793,0.0742,5.8731,1.8955,1.4144,0.8124,4.5544,0.8224,1.3933,3.9518,0.8038,4.0626,6.5781,1.2979,5.8684,7.295,7.124,3.6709,1.4716,4.2983,5.6836,1.2953,0.2158,1.6716,0.5335,2.0797,1.1834,1.3187,5.8939,1.7701,1.9531,1.0726,1.3867,2.5076,5.2926,7.7653,0.9208,1.8712,1.2651,1.1832,2.7706,0.3567,3.8509,3.8358,1.1919,0.1133,0.2969,0.755,2.227,3.3667,1.2967,8.332,5.2993,6.2127,6.1869,2.0477,6.9122,3.0763,3.3091,2.9222,7.3084,0.058,0.6934,1.0699,1.1821,1.0659,2.0246,2.0082,0.5538,0.8855,1.7795,1.0867,2.1074,5.161,0.0101,2.4926,4.02,7.2954,3.6281,1.5903,3.0355,0.4083,2.0199,0.006,0.0004,3.0818,0.2588,0.4113,2.4248,5.4527,4.442,5.8529,3.1822,6.7956,0.0046,0.8019,4.409,0.0618,0.4606,0.1769,2.9279,5.2561,3.8235,3.6671,1.8201,0.0017,0.2176,8.9559,6.2076,0.992,5.0511,0.3897,1.6129,2.8312,6.709,2.5924,0.1963,3.0758,0.976,2.6221,1.2568,5.4968,1.2536,6.7325,0.4243,3.8994,0.863,0.3503,2.2788,2.9483,3.4252,3.3637,1.276,1.5913,1.3233,0.7183,1.6173,5.3399,4.869,7.0081,3.3347,4.6272,0.5633,5.4388,2.8503,1.6242,3.3662,3.9283,3.2333,4.1792,1.59,0.4993,3.4408,1.7443,1.2858,0.3407,1.5614,2.8116,4.8685,2.7899,0.6044,3.8778,1.8274,5.0511,1.8136,4.0576,7.1182,5.4423,0.3535,2.4138,3.2994,1.4492,1.2208,0.1942,1.3876,2.7057,8.0261,6.3786,6.1904,4.2784,2.2536,1.8416,5.1899,3.867,3.7846,0.957,0.2674,1.1447,3.4706,1.0848,2.5931,0.0598,0.4286,0.6151,0.1669,2.8964,4.012,1.4302,3.0583,6.0516,2.7951,2.0975,0.4918,2.9482,4.6722,3.7491,2.5205,0.9792,1.2305,1.0043,4.1125,2.7559,4.5241,4.1349,0.3962,0.4565,0.5411,6.2809,2.1976,1.3182,2.4608,1.8376,0.8867,0.7766,3.6665,0.8377,4.6499,3.3069,4.509,2.7034,0.6551,6.5805,0.6325,1.2453,1.2246,5.6392,6.4229,0.8966,0.9139,2.3474,0.5595,3.0969,5.6123,1.9853,0.9795,1.1962,0.0686,2.8947,1.2855,0.0012,1.0072,2.902,0.0694,3.5157,0.0373,0.3453,4.5731,0.0362,0.0009,0.4555,1.6555,2.003,2.2717,1.5933,3.37,1.2251,1.0082,3.2227,2.012,4.6984,3.1795,0.7715,0.4252,1.4389,4.979,5.4609,3.3459,6.9857,3.4655,0.4379,2.6451,0.7604,0.2808,0.024,3.087,1.6869,5.3964,0.0589,1.7212,0.7812,3.7634,4.2514,3.7203,1.1984,2.6807,3.9324,4.8924,0.0562,3.4991,0.5467,4.936,2.7455,6.02,0.5583,1.0158,0.7787,0.1115,0.4342,3.8779,4.5698,4.523,2.6224,0.681,7.499,4.8247,1.495,5.1845,1.3052,1.6561,1.6284,1.8703,4.9386,3.0533,5.034,1.1628,6.2454,1.2651,4.1695,2.6204,2.9732,0.0623,6.0106,2.6443,3.9827,3.4905,7.5958,4.5071,4.2305,3.3583,2.427,4.6517,0.7333,1.2043,3.752,2.6901,2.5449,0.9752,1.4641,0.3533,5.843,6.6657,1.0793,3.7015,0.1111,3.639,3.2963,0.9281]}
{"id":3624,"ended":true,"length":502,"text":"Concerns expressed by some politicians on the subject of salvia reflect those of the media, with comparisons to LSD and particular focus on `` protecting our children `` being echoed ; and with legislative action that would, in the future, have broader impact in a much sooner future.\n\nIn a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Republican Senator Jerry Sandusky, a Republican who is the chairman of the House Judiciary & Oversight Committee, said the Republican Party needs to find a way to keep its name \"from going away\" from the \"legal and moral foundation of our constitution and government, and to reestablish it in terms of legal protections for children.\"\n\nSeveral members of the House of Representatives said they had never heard of the term ``legal and moral'' because the substance of Congress' work to combat sexual abuse wasn't clear.\n\nSeedless, a son of an alcohol-smokers father, was a member of the first legislative police commission established in 1973 in the United States and had previously worked in the office of a U.S. Senator from Michigan. Prosecutors found Seedless guilty in the rape of a 5-year-old girl, alleging that she had used the substance to induce sexual intercourse with his father and another sex worker, and in a subsequent indictment charged that seedless had abused them. His convictions were overturned in 2011.\n\nIn his letter to Sandusky, Sandusky noted that the term ``legal and moral'' had been used more generally than previously discussed, ''especially after a few hundred years of historical use.\" He also wrote of the potential impacts of legislation that would protect children who had been exposed to chemicals or drugs, such as those found by drug tests.\n\n''What makes it clear to the public is that the Congress intended to protect children from this horrible chemical, even after the first few hundred years of use,\" Sandusky wrote.\n\nSeedless noted that the U.S. Congress has no criminal record against the substances.\n\nSinger Paul McCartney, who had been convicted of sexual abuse in 1986, has said he wants the word ``legal and moral'' removed from his music.\n\nThe federal government had not formally authorized medical research for the substance, though it had allowed it to be used through the 1980s. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration required FDA to submit an application for approval on Feb. 1, 1983, after a study was conducted in 1981, that established drug and chemical protection for young people.\n\nThe agency said in a 1999 statement, ''The use of marijuana for medical purposes is the legal definition of marijuana,'' suggesting that the substance could be used in medicine and for treating various diseases.","token_len":548,"entropy":[9.9723,0.61,6.1138,0.7169,2.7947,4.8803,3.8134,1.3325,5.4449,1.4772,10.8154,8.0018,8.7011,5.3308,0.3918,1.4668,5.6116,1.418,3.5346,9.4112,1.6324,8.023,2.4248,11.0564,7.4883,0.3513,10.4908,16.4759,4.41,2.4965,3.2584,5.3606,7.787,11.9194,2.8642,4.211,8.6971,3.3538,4.0525,2.1214,4.671,1.5738,2.0103,4.0671,0.0295,3.812,6.7255,3.2813,3.3085,3.9111,5.2923,11.4851,4.2417,0.2568,1.731,0.2274,2.9117,2.7013,2.5965,0.4915,1.0531,4.9648,0.8632,0.0218,0.0759,0.8706,0.2101,0.8248,6.3804,2.3316,5.9124,7.852,0.7976,1.1137,1.9782,3.6931,2.7794,2.1595,2.6002,2.3841,0.0162,0.0983,2.1288,1.0446,9.5676,5.3644,0.2948,0.1656,1.902,2.3272,7.3891,3.0569,4.2853,0.1423,4.3048,0.9533,0.8831,0.1932,4.731,1.8671,6.4137,4.4178,3.571,4.639,3.385,3.2454,2.5344,1.3999,4.3023,6.2087,2.467,1.438,7.1019,0.5839,2.6246,6.4747,2.1336,3.7602,3.4675,1.2075,2.4949,5.1605,1.587,3.3646,1.2906,6.4961,0.5787,5.3094,3.3738,0.997,1.6886,1.8773,0.6521,0.0004,6.1397,2.5923,0.1551,0.8116,1.0085,2.9642,0.0056,3.9115,0.8318,2.8159,4.2334,0.6966,0.3729,1.8341,5.2358,0.5897,1.9386,0.6963,0.0112,1.2403,5.1209,2.3857,6.9251,6.0929,10.2776,0.7315,5.4846,4.1071,3.7298,2.4237,0.356,6.1348,0.0027,4.5951,0.6157,0.7548,0.0004,4.9508,9.813,5.903,3.075,4.5065,8.346,0.3736,2.9885,5.3818,2.6545,5.2749,2.5608,1.7872,1.3071,2.0735,3.2414,3.1302,0.0148,0.4934,5.7411,5.9101,7.6871,1.4974,3.2037,1.1874,3.8587,3.3506,2.0183,3.6072,0.0131,2.9274,3.8598,4.4531,2.1839,2.0075,0.9243,4.9789,0.0222,2.8797,4.0876,0.0015,0.0164,0.0049,1.9515,1.8964,3.206,0.7023,8.3468,4.5513,5.7088,0.004,1.8985,1.9228,3.6214,4.7551,1.3283,0.8282,4.6185,0.0175,0.0509,0.0297,0.0014,0.377,2.2966,5.8858,1.3846,1.9878,0.8214,4.6696,2.2389,2.1886,1.3576,3.0537,2.0183,0.7051,1.7879,3.2959,3.0461,2.4025,5.3667,7.5079,1.8887,2.1106,1.9987,3.449,2.7473,2.9407,5.8695,2.6802,1.5931,3.7845,0.0068,1.3585,3.0299,6.3566,1.0958,4.6448,4.556,0.4403,1.4137,1.1955,5.641,0.853,0.3483,0.0003,2.3461,2.3915,1.6097,0.5935,2.6644,0.0001,0.1698,1.573,0.0,3.8481,0.4316,1.7127,3.408,0.1479,0.1689,0.088,0.0069,0.1346,2.5973,0.9406,1.0893,4.13,4.8254,3.6945,4.0978,7.0592,1.2666,5.9642,3.177,4.2949,3.2672,3.9816,4.454,0.2362,0.4347,6.3082,3.0884,3.9251,1.9228,2.0803,4.3022,3.207,1.1637,4.7259,6.4771,0.9182,3.8424,1.4061,0.5602,3.9216,0.7246,3.689,2.253,0.737,3.3672,0.1032,5.9431,2.055,2.4963,1.8207,2.226,0.0021,3.8317,1.8404,6.1701,5.8493,3.7004,1.4039,0.295,0.0003,3.7306,4.0575,4.5504,2.3483,4.9135,2.038,3.0997,2.2618,3.1587,0.2639,1.863,5.9528,6.3139,0.4714,1.1275,0.6552,1.0719,3.9185,4.5183,3.8127,2.0968,4.001,2.9654,2.02,4.117,3.6504,0.4768,0.0359,0.5078,1.6503,4.0347,1.9837,0.0001,0.3518,0.2654,0.9203,0.0002,2.7489,0.0616,0.008,8.0112,0.3399,1.6357,4.4164,0.0004,0.0048,0.0028,3.1499,3.1123,4.3173,4.0778,1.8402,4.0801,3.3254,4.8746,3.8431,1.3622,0.0002,2.6628,6.7838,4.4555,0.4756,1.2869,1.0476,3.5815,1.3148,2.5505,0.452,3.0199,0.7977,1.4672,3.581,0.5487,2.766,1.5885,0.9737,5.0969,2.1123,3.5667,0.6193,0.2277,0.1862,0.0128,0.2269,2.7065,0.0333,1.484,2.0118,0.908,0.8307,0.0003,2.5003,6.2189,0.7455,4.2225,3.3275,4.2844,4.7695,5.5419,2.198,4.8553,2.1529,4.6834,1.2076,3.6288,1.6591,2.1741,4.6592,1.827,0.9039,0.2023,0.7388,5.8926,1.8173,4.2476,0.0606,1.0742,4.3901,0.0071,1.6693,2.5794,0.0004,0.0052,0.0022,1.9515,0.0075,0.0023,0.0067,5.8944,6.0229,3.8501,4.3266,3.3253,2.2918,0.9033,1.5573,4.111,4.3218,0.0058,2.1842,0.5138,3.9743,0.5654,3.3026,2.0677,3.9936,3.422,2.3513,2.1626,5.3472,3.0278,4.0873,5.4678,5.8481,3.5141,1.7058,7.2022,1.3817,4.8147,1.7942,1.1605,0.589,0.0004,1.7364,3.5948,2.5015,1.5598,1.1295,5.6742,2.0402,3.0644,2.5875,1.7614,2.4094,0.071,3.0383,1.9978,1.6502,0.382,1.0478,4.9776,4.2754,4.782,0.1937,2.5608,5.2443,5.6902,0.5852,1.5293,3.2761,2.1192,0.6184,0.5306,2.2307,3.9318,2.0343,3.0568,4.3279,4.1777,2.0583,0.5764]}
{"id":1581,"ended":false,"length":493,"text":"On July 24 a tropical disturbance behind Hurricane Hernan strengthened into a tropical depression. Due to the close proximity of Hernan to its west, the development of the depression was hindered due to the low pressure on the horizon. The development of El Ni\u00f1o has lowered the intensity of the depression and has eased the circulation, while El Ni\u00f1o has strengthened the circulation in the tropical zone.\n\nOn Friday the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) had said that El Ni\u00f1o may be the most active tropical circulation system in the Caribbean and the Atlantic basin this year. It is expected to weaken into a tropical and low pressure system later Friday. That means that El Ni\u00f1o will be strengthened into a high pressure system later Sunday, but it is possible that it will weaken into a low disturbance this evening. The system should weaken to a tropical and low pressure system on Thursday or Friday night at a later date. The tropical model forecast for El Ni\u00f1o is that the circulation will be weak to a high pressure system that is moving slowly northwest of Florida or southern New England, which may result in more active El Ni\u00f1o.\n\nSome tropical systems that should start to appear in the South Atlantic region or southern New England on Monday, July 25, include:\n\nPump Up the Water!\n\nPump Up the Water!\n\nThis is a monthly blog post in which we take stock of our home waters, including home pumps.

{"id":3707,"ended":true,"length":461,"text":"Macromolecules such as starch, cellulose or proteins can not be rapidly taken up by cells and must be broken into their smaller units before they can be used in cell metabolism. Several common methods have been used for preparing macromolecules such as a starch compound and an inter-polymer such as an amino acid or a ketone. Example 1-S, the example is an internalization process (process) in which starch is processed in the presence of water and water reacts with the starch to produce a macromolecule suitable for the desired reaction with water. In the process, the starch is digested by reacting solvents such as ethanol, water, acetone and a water-soluble alcohol with water to prepare the starch. The starch is then digested by washing to produce a macromolecule suitable for the reaction with water. In the process, a hydrocarbon alcohol with water is added to the starch to form the final preparation, which is then washed in the water bath and then dried in the water source. In Example 2-L, the preparation of the polymerization reaction can be accomplished by washing the solvent in a heated solvent bath, or by drying the solvent in an solvent and then covering the solvent with a layer of the solvent.\nA polymeric solubility in water is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 2,744,863 to G. Shand. This patent describes various solvents being used in such a process known as \u201cdry solvent bath\u201d (a solvent of the same general shape as that which is usually used in water-based processing or in water-soluble polyethylene or polyethylene-based polymers), and the preparation of these solvents in a dry solvent bath (A, B, C and D).\nAs disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,981,521 to M. Y. Y. Kim (1996), the process of making polymers is generally complicated in terms of solubility in water. During drying the solvent in a dry solvent bath, water is often used in reaction with solvents. In general, the water is usually used at a specific temperature above the water temperature through the process.\nIn the prior art, it is often customary for solvents to react with an organic solvent such as alcohol. However, because of the various reactions taking place in a solvent bath, a large amount of solvent is required or the resulting polymeric solubility may not be very stable.\nTherefore, further efforts have been made to develop a polymerization reaction apparatus which is highly stable in comparison with conventional conventional methods.","token_len":549,"entropy":[8.2845,4.6397,1.3792,5.5608,0.0046,6.5276,0.9093,4.0538,0.0077,4.308,3.7714,2.6932,6.1083,1.2613,6.6541,7.388,0.2531,0.4886,3.1374,2.4334,4.3987,0.3063,4.9669,4.5501,4.5685,6.5354,5.485,4.3893,0.9571,0.1863,0.3689,2.1509,1.8627,3.3194,3.8367,0.3162,6.5217,5.0853,4.2615,2.92,0.0595,1.4964,2.1987,5.3865,7.4203,0.0102,0.0073,0.0098,1.5362,0.002,5.6659,2.9573,7.1582,2.5505,3.2969,6.3411,4.0895,7.7817,0.6543,4.9059,0.0025,3.5979,3.1047,0.1523,3.0882,1.2642,6.3087,0.2333,1.3427,8.8457,2.6149,4.5896,6.1583,3.5671,3.4752,5.5153,3.6039,3.577,6.617,6.0151,3.7803,3.5663,8.6756,2.1035,2.7167,0.2011,2.837,0.6838,4.6317,2.1292,2.0438,1.1559,0.0334,3.5974,1.769,3.0425,5.3762,0.3935,1.6487,2.5622,2.1656,3.1192,1.2965,6.1822,0.0687,0.0014,0.3083,6.4262,0.0444,2.157,5.4534,3.5384,5.2882,2.2102,0.4178,2.783,1.8291,3.1189,0.8202,0.8669,1.0575,1.0148,6.1959,0.0007,1.4813,6.5185,8.567,2.8651,0.0036,1.289,0.0039,3.6378,1.1707,2.9639,0.8841,4.0746,0.1922,1.1885,3.4872,5.0098,1.7655,0.226,0.0087,5.6575,4.4461,2.4585,1.7302,7.5477,1.2478,2.0597,1.0772,1.2193,1.9197,0.9455,0.5625,3.7136,0.0002,0.86,6.4494,5.7005,4.6976,0.9846,4.0462,0.0046,0.0021,0.0766,0.7444,0.0178,0.4654,1.7258,0.7576,0.4051,0.3965,2.3503,1.0779,0.9729,0.1958,2.9734,4.9848,1.3419,7.3788,5.1586,1.6426,0.658,0.4582,0.4857,0.6353,1.5509,1.353,1.086,1.368,4.96,8.7191,3.0912,1.8555,0.5954,1.0868,4.863,3.3904,1.9715,2.7655,4.1624,1.951,2.8402,3.2559,1.9831,0.9382,3.3408,7.2644,0.7706,2.2577,3.8736,0.3794,0.3291,3.8807,0.1282,0.526,5.8366,1.3216,1.6385,6.4591,5.8174,1.5855,4.0761,0.186,2.8401,0.7638,4.2536,0.7731,6.4972,1.8655,1.6176,6.0762,5.0689,3.3552,2.8267,3.563,0.5936,4.0758,0.5469,1.1924,0.7017,2.6558,9.8342,5.3408,1.3433,7.4123,0.5933,1.2828,0.561,0.7343,3.6534,0.0223,3.0852,3.2198,1.0769,3.0104,10.2275,5.5065,1.3062,5.7173,2.7207,2.8847,4.142,1.8563,1.4167,8.3758,3.846,1.5561,0.0553,0.3749,0.8328,6.9815,0.6468,0.1411,0.0165,0.2993,0.0113,0.2293,0.0036,4.1863,0.0078,3.9549,3.4746,0.0355,5.9529,0.9617,3.4924,5.3809,1.3777,7.4644,6.2523,3.7524,8.5969,5.634,2.772,5.6601,3.3443,5.4829,0.0028,5.7586,0.523,0.9432,5.2075,0.5598,0.9803,7.3544,0.0171,11.2293,8.4708,8.3228,5.2478,5.9162,3.9162,7.7631,2.8926,5.629,4.1664,5.6097,1.0469,1.9145,6.9379,4.0549,0.6081,3.759,4.4344,0.6817,4.8498,0.2996,0.6598,3.9963,1.8382,1.986,4.6478,4.3283,2.0987,3.7916,0.3584,1.4455,0.0113,3.8594,4.5895,0.0103,3.5395,1.306,0.9953,0.009,2.8692,2.2384,2.2052,1.2041,2.4552,1.6068,2.7838,4.8674,0.3714,3.6316,0.4659,0.3606,0.0007,2.0231,1.3316,2.6981,0.4389,0.621,3.0419,5.3496,3.4591,1.237,0.6796,0.2552,2.6116,0.0711,0.6723,1.445,4.3961,4.7641,0.8018,0.9094,0.0007,0.0018,0.0006,0.0453,0.0011,0.2011,0.0013,1.9942,0.0017,6.1028,2.1467,0.047,4.7441,2.2387,0.748,3.3068,0.027,5.4238,0.7038,4.2629,1.9053,4.8396,3.7042,5.9916,0.3337,1.6965,3.0532,0.7693,2.7611,2.7079,0.9173,1.6166,4.4538,7.9516,3.0504,3.2087,0.0025,4.0661,0.1424,0.0394,3.9476,0.2504,0.9211,6.2094,3.9287,2.9083,0.989,2.4159,1.1044,1.6957,0.2507,0.2269,2.9313,3.7775,0.7158,5.1725,2.3981,3.1156,5.7197,0.1611,4.3559,0.2363,0.0038,2.8283,2.0229,4.6772,0.1029,1.1933,2.6348,1.635,4.0167,2.5211,4.178,1.5937,4.678,0.5407,5.455,1.446,2.4258,3.0331,8.8819,1.7453,3.1532,4.0412,3.7906,1.9495,1.7675,8.0218,2.4525,0.4419,3.3627,1.1254,4.0697,6.1109,1.0378,3.4421,1.0448,0.0051,0.4096,5.4148,0.3957,4.4061,3.7052,1.6163,1.974,0.0083,2.9137,2.8115,2.558,0.0296,4.2518,1.2696,0.3881,6.0554,2.1907,5.5569,0.0016,0.9578,2.7978,2.9783,0.8318,0.4453,3.2522,4.9643,1.7729,0.0367,3.4907,1.5121,1.4015,7.1062,2.8395,3.5776,2.7319,2.4361,1.0397,0.0632,0.0332,2.2472,0.9346,0.1923,5.3626,2.969,0.6657,2.6804,6.5049,0.0641,7.5273,5.8807,1.5065,0.0432,0.071,0.1796,3.1623,1.2307,4.0976,0.497,1.1048,5.7148,3.1048,1.9954,5.4746,1.5371,1.6972,8.0739,1.1352,3.1605,5.9951,2.435,0.9593]}

{"id":1212,"ended":true,"length":510,"text":"The in @ - @ flight food is catered by < unk > Air Catering, another joint venture between Tata and a Singaporean company, headed by Chef Arun Batra, formerly the executive director of Pune Chef, & is a private catering company based in Chennai. \"We are aware of Indian Food, our industry is a huge one, catering in-house, so we are well versed in our industry and we have had an annual turnover over the last ten years. So we see a huge potential for catering in Singapore, especially among the younger and less travelled tourists. We have also received a number and are looking at launching a catering service for Singaporeans\", Mr Batra told TechCrunch India.\n\nIn addition to delivering the food, Air Catering has a menu of courses to cater to the various lifestyle needs of different tourists. A restaurant has multiple seating areas at a table, which are packed with a variety of different items. \"We also offer a range of courses for the tourists, and that is in addition to our regular menu that our Singapore clients have chosen. That said, I would say that we have a number of courses that cater to the different lifestyle needs of our clients - whether that be vegetarian, healthy, fizzy and fizzy,\" he further said.\n\nOn his part, Air Catering CEO Vijay Raut said that he has no doubt about the success of catering as it is a popular option for Singaporeans. \"We cater to those clients on a regular basis,\" said Mr Raut who has been working with the catering company since 2011. With most of our clientele either travelling to Singapore or abroad and therefore not being able to pay the money the chefs give to their chefs, Air Catering is sure to provide a delicious and memorable take on food.\n\nAir Catering had also earlier said that this was a \"potential to-do\" for them, as they would cater for the needs of the travellers like the ones who are going to Singapore or abroad.\n\nAccording to the Indian Embassy in Chennai, Air Catering has been listed by the Indian authorities to operate in the Indian economy as a \"potential to-do\" for Air Catering.\n\nWe are at the receiving end of India's government's move to shut down any airline business in the country. The move has come as a surprise for Air Catering. But it seems to be a significant change in the Indian government's stance, that the country has not been made ready to open the airlines and its airlines are getting shut down, even as in a previous announcement, the government had said that Air Catering was on the verge of shutting all its air travel between India and Australia.","token_len":551,"entropy":[5.7039,12.8359,9.512,3.7124,11.1214,8.8579,3.5094,8.4259,1.294,1.0196,8.1147,10.0647,5.7469,5.5768,8.7235,8.9454,0.053,2.7942,8.7973,6.811,2.6475,1.8097,8.5618,1.9656,5.6448,5.4809,2.9279,1.3778,1.5668,7.8278,0.1846,6.1972,6.2969,1.3214,8.1129,0.6137,1.9254,5.9843,3.4913,4.5217,3.345,0.1439,5.5512,2.8039,7.5451,2.4877,6.5163,5.5263,2.51,4.2636,3.1287,0.7038,3.1961,0.1854,3.9098,0.4855,3.5676,1.6631,1.5227,5.711,0.2594,6.9125,5.0617,4.3612,4.8087,6.9433,1.4502,4.4237,2.8567,1.2989,1.1958,6.3501,2.872,6.3999,0.6193,2.6284,3.4695,0.8251,1.3472,4.9965,3.1707,0.0024,0.2401,3.4776,3.1312,1.6281,2.2663,1.738,4.033,3.5498,6.5383,1.7778,5.2314,4.3246,0.6536,4.1135,0.0519,1.4891,3.778,1.0257,6.0917,2.5839,2.3674,2.0501,1.3446,5.1521,0.8498,5.1185,2.0398,2.3831,4.6095,1.586,2.3324,3.1045,3.1548,8.3817,4.816,1.493,1.466,1.9748,2.8704,3.9298,1.7794,2.3922,8.977,4.3979,1.71,1.7763,5.5931,0.9765,2.5964,2.2467,2.8789,3.7339,2.1735,5.4426,4.6303,0.7739,0.0003,1.7213,6.4702,1.0006,4.1647,0.3655,0.7575,0.0003,3.6832,2.4498,0.4906,6.4335,2.9592,2.494,1.4736,3.7429,0.0967,0.0014,1.6495,2.8007,5.8515,0.5257,6.8749,3.5041,1.3989,0.3966,1.8836,3.7727,5.6267,2.1418,0.4278,4.8681,5.2023,0.9121,4.0592,4.9516,4.1827,6.9577,4.3676,1.4828,4.5543,3.3557,4.4721,1.2796,2.4642,2.46,5.4308,0.3783,4.0743,1.0595,0.0064,2.25,3.2225,1.4667,2.2701,1.3632,2.8913,1.285,1.6469,2.8847,0.0084,4.4573,2.4489,2.4954,5.3499,1.7184,2.9357,4.9548,1.3575,5.0286,1.434,0.0174,1.9234,2.975,2.27,3.6542,5.0036,5.5526,5.4185,1.8052,4.1355,2.2454,4.6499,4.881,0.1238,4.7696,2.5197,1.542,0.6135,1.7031,1.3975,1.6255,4.1064,0.0214,2.2445,1.2213,1.1354,0.2162,1.398,1.746,2.0867,0.2525,0.1439,2.0794,0.8619,5.2598,4.2832,3.027,0.6253,5.5684,0.4612,5.0377,0.8,6.5056,3.5877,2.6578,5.8123,0.5148,5.3659,2.1435,6.3655,1.0887,0.0697,0.3755,0.0002,5.2557,3.4572,2.7159,0.0764,2.177,0.0055,0.0056,3.2669,4.9124,0.0364,2.8396,3.4187,1.6475,1.2606,1.8118,2.0833,3.1277,2.4689,2.8246,0.4816,3.0096,0.1865,4.807,4.1252,2.0898,0.9983,1.4101,4.934,3.3717,1.0267,2.4012,0.2767,0.6449,0.3005,1.4541,5.0672,0.7295,4.7098,6.2419,4.7531,0.4688,1.4565,0.0136,4.4328,3.3894,0.6741,0.0714,0.0,4.3524,2.5597,1.5637,2.5338,1.3765,1.6673,4.4801,0.8094,2.0341,2.9393,0.2913,5.8115,6.4413,0.6653,2.9748,5.003,0.4236,6.7392,2.6003,1.436,2.1339,0.7062,4.1848,3.8607,5.6005,2.7368,3.0292,0.5342,0.0024,4.1173,1.9193,5.9147,5.3022,6.5292,5.6991,1.9699,2.6678,4.517,0.3515,2.0565,0.0031,0.0047,1.4705,6.1016,0.2472,4.0829,0.9193,4.9144,1.8594,4.5398,7.7513,0.175,3.8513,1.0328,0.653,0.0002,1.8957,0.0148,0.004,5.0026,3.3606,5.1726,2.5168,0.2282,5.4313,2.341,1.5798,2.714,5.9048,0.2308,4.5184,9.2672,1.4597,0.4648,1.254,2.0321,2.321,2.0828,1.4761,2.704,4.5853,2.4261,1.9152,2.0702,0.0348,1.6805,4.7675,6.1851,2.3091,3.9809,1.6125,1.6378,4.157,0.3754,3.1542,2.9573,1.0099,0.4475,1.4031,0.0001,4.3337,0.0042,1.9881,3.8254,4.8997,1.0701,3.6466,0.1581,1.4536,0.007,0.0047,1.4818,1.9003,5.9861,2.6558,0.9614,1.7581,5.0305,4.3538,2.9393,1.392,1.7015,1.8815,5.7193,3.3522,1.487,2.2442,4.2371,0.0754,1.7766,0.3881,0.0033,0.2244,1.0094,8.2852,0.8851,0.0059,1.0096,1.424,0.0002,5.4568,1.6887,5.5625,1.1435,7.2473,0.0281,0.0452,5.5371,0.2084,5.3892,0.6227,4.5542,0.2526,5.6011,0.1973,6.079,4.4631,4.7291,1.0708,1.1732,0.2514,1.2319,2.3345,2.3433,2.4341,2.5813,1.4259,0.6563,1.5916,3.8443,2.2258,0.0308,0.0042,2.1433,5.0947,2.4838,3.9031,1.9171,1.0375,1.2688,5.386,3.4698,1.5154,0.9651,2.0438,2.1931,0.1613,2.6573,3.0619,5.5552,2.4215,2.5693,1.8269,3.1695,1.9308,7.3845,5.4484,0.7789,3.3389,3.588,5.4965,3.2024,4.9256,4.105,1.4768,5.4138,4.4957,0.3326,2.7712,4.2369,2.5745,6.0429,4.7028,2.9027,5.2838,1.2717,1.6516,1.0959,1.4203,1.637,0.5423,2.7655,0.0743,0.0033,1.9365,5.1604,0.9409,1.3506,0.0181,1.8731,5.2376,1.9401,4.3009,3.0459,6.4424,1.2457,0.0619,5.337,0.4621]}
{"id":1296,"ended":false,"length":498,"text":"Following Alice in Chains'extensive 1993 world tour, Staley said the band `` just wanted to go into the studio for a few days with our acoustic guitars and see what happened ``' and then on the next day, it was announced they would be playing here in New York, and they were going to play there a few days before their first-ever show.\n\n''We didn\u2019t see any of these new rock bands, so we started with them,'' he said. \"In a way, they were going to the very beginning [of our era].... We were playing on and off of every one of these things for a while, but we didn\u2019t see them before they had even started doing songs that we had written in previous records... And as much as I loved them, they were not one-off hits; they were a big rock band with really strong personality.... And we were always on time, and I don\u2019t expect bands to do that in the same way. It was really a very strange time. That\u2019s all you can say about it.''\n\nStealey had been a longtime promoter of bands like Staley\u2019s, with his company and the bands the group was in attendance at. He said his biggest regret is that the band went ahead with what many in the band planned.\n\n''You just keep going and it\u2019s not the same thing,'' he said. ``The biggest step... is to go and hang with them.''\n\nStaley also explained how the band had to build its new studio at the corner of Ninth and Seventh-Street, between Fifth and Sixth Streets. He said the studio was in a big shape and the sound was \"really heavy''.\n\n''We had to build our own music,'' said him. ''We have a hard time dealing with the kind of things we did in the studio.'''\n\nIn other news, Alice in Chains, the band of Alice in Chains, is bringing back Peter Molyneux\u2019s iconic cover of the 1964 release, \u201cThe Long Day\u2019s Night.\u201d\n\nMolyneux released three songs with Alice in Chains during the 1964 show, called \u201cAn Old Time Reject.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe took up a lot of space, and when you watch her back, with her little voice at the back, and a look of joy on her face, she didn\u2019t look like she had any plans or desires, just in a way that seemed very happy to me,\u201d Molyneux said.\n\nThe band said it would be \u201ca great night out.\u201d","token_len":551,"entropy":[11.0513,2.8543,2.8375,2.7101,13.8871,3.7368,9.5202,7.7688,0.0943,0.4013,8.024,6.7664,3.1771,2.2773,1.4945,12.5876,11.589,2.6197,0.1933,3.5986,4.1895,1.3845,1.5927,4.2826,0.8979,1.4185,1.1749,4.1399,4.3284,5.0825,1.7192,0.9264,4.332,0.7096,2.9868,11.6654,6.3405,3.8566,2.7276,6.3095,1.4891,2.9022,0.9585,1.6191,3.6938,0.903,6.1988,3.0022,1.4947,0.7245,1.7383,5.7654,2.0191,2.8004,0.2698,2.602,1.8073,2.1093,1.6862,2.4228,0.2248,1.1836,2.4284,3.9375,1.3785,0.7109,2.6542,3.1279,3.1507,6.3098,0.0207,1.4265,1.3596,2.7163,0.0047,2.2748,2.6692,2.9464,16.0612,7.6397,0.2764,4.3168,2.3024,2.3482,3.1004,4.0894,6.0776,1.372,2.9025,2.6911,0.6064,4.5879,4.8065,4.3898,3.2031,1.3953,0.4103,0.1591,2.2653,4.7946,3.2364,1.5089,0.3234,1.7662,0.6384,4.6177,0.3336,5.5156,5.5364,1.8766,7.2131,0.3637,4.7655,7.0881,1.6864,6.171,1.9905,1.6646,3.7808,3.6536,5.9698,0.1198,3.0285,5.1857,4.8529,0.06,1.2809,3.945,2.2913,1.0536,1.7363,0.9952,1.5651,1.6623,1.8107,1.1082,0.067,0.041,0.634,2.1103,4.873,1.7581,3.9098,2.5096,1.5943,5.749,5.1918,3.8104,1.494,1.8873,1.8208,3.0035,5.3417,4.0806,5.0085,3.4949,4.7489,4.5087,0.0694,1.8914,3.6465,2.0025,0.4896,1.8339,0.7765,3.2529,5.1661,3.6381,1.9814,5.0613,4.3388,0.4186,0.2345,2.9537,3.5248,6.4119,0.6666,2.7999,4.4829,3.0338,6.1593,6.5633,2.6,2.2822,1.6625,3.7335,3.6734,5.1608,1.3912,1.7727,2.9482,3.4419,0.2626,0.0711,0.0576,6.7639,6.7635,0.6932,2.9311,1.008,3.1986,1.2236,1.0271,0.4369,1.5211,2.6687,0.876,3.3202,2.4352,3.55,4.8883,1.4018,2.2991,4.8275,6.7296,0.1436,1.9322,3.4348,3.5121,1.5846,0.562,0.5909,0.8425,2.2231,0.1507,0.0004,5.0778,1.1856,4.41,2.1558,2.8489,3.502,5.9346,0.5464,4.2901,1.4221,4.5669,4.5105,7.6628,0.1743,1.0882,2.0612,4.8092,2.587,5.4538,4.2158,2.8606,5.9377,5.2731,3.1878,2.2641,3.9601,5.1779,0.3808,2.5944,1.3849,1.6312,3.0701,4.3464,2.8329,2.8088,0.7807,2.1103,1.1475,4.3553,5.2137,0.5383,3.9221,4.4001,4.2384,0.3108,2.3596,8.2401,2.4665,0.5663,0.0002,1.8751,4.199,4.1141,5.2569,2.3097,2.1616,3.8039,7.1678,0.1983,0.035,2.4025,3.2089,1.2999,2.2773,1.9968,0.2361,0.0497,0.104,2.4764,3.2836,4.4267,6.9035,7.1287,1.7349,1.2129,2.4481,2.1343,6.7289,3.5819,1.2806,3.769,0.2756,0.0004,3.3213,0.0022,3.4919,5.8048,2.1707,1.8772,0.9436,2.8789,2.4734,5.58,2.9345,4.6202,2.2933,3.5557,1.3916,4.2593,0.0278,6.3229,0.5784,4.5204,10.2133,1.3398,1.7389,4.2811,2.332,0.3774,1.5491,2.0245,1.2045,2.2334,0.4313,1.4195,2.9099,0.8852,4.1016,1.4921,4.1231,6.6481,1.7424,2.4057,3.101,0.9828,5.3953,2.5252,4.9989,7.923,0.6365,0.0002,2.4664,1.5538,1.7314,0.8885,2.0893,3.3169,1.006,5.3047,3.5101,3.0553,7.2931,0.243,1.2855,1.0962,4.711,1.4108,6.4233,0.158,5.0136,0.0076,1.502,4.8692,0.0025,4.3288,1.8532,4.33,1.7951,0.8135,1.8856,6.9247,3.6459,0.1407,0.0003,3.4769,4.7892,2.8265,0.659,5.0751,0.3214,0.0003,4.227,2.3404,1.2395,4.747,5.2222,1.1681,0.0192,1.3561,2.4949,5.517,1.6046,7.6483,4.8159,0.3052,0.0057,0.0147,5.9592,0.2316,0.7255,4.6001,3.7647,0.3875,1.9912,7.4573,6.0274,2.9053,8.9568,4.9223,2.8198,5.7449,5.0311,3.7405,2.0762,2.245,7.4727,1.0709,6.92,7.0983,0.9118,0.0003,3.0099,0.0085,0.0031,0.0005,4.3702,4.5179,3.066,3.4289,1.847,0.0695,0.0002,2.8235,0.9829,4.3319,5.4496,0.9465,6.7762,3.5632,0.667,6.1055,4.9763,4.6253,7.1601,3.7153,4.4774,4.3743,0.5851,1.0623,0.0002,4.3991,0.6079,6.6438,5.6865,5.1812,2.1477,4.2223,0.0131,3.1182,2.2599,1.2687,3.9461,2.5949,7.0593,1.849,6.183,2.0148,6.3242,1.3841,5.8785,3.211,5.9326,0.5492,3.217,0.9915,2.4805,4.8928,5.5607,0.7575,4.4644,2.1352,0.0333,0.0382,0.3742,2.7761,5.0449,0.2025,0.1996,0.301,2.8822,0.9791,1.0218,2.109,2.5417,5.2104,3.9678,5.1017,2.8686,4.5481,5.4716,1.9305,1.2555,1.2299,3.8782,2.9842,5.5265,2.1398,2.27,1.8131,5.2868,4.4549,6.7599,0.0028,0.004,0.0005,0.8939,0.1826,0.2869,0.0002,2.2426,1.6027,4.1751,1.3896,2.5536,1.7286,11.8086,0.1597,2.0678,2.7005,5.9897,3.4854,2.4106,2.1836,1.2801]}
{"id":2756,"ended":false,"length":470,"text":"Sedna's orbit When Sedna was discovered, its extreme orbit raised questions about its origin. Its perihelion is so distant ( approximately 75 AU ) that no currently observed mechanism can explain Sedna's absence on the horizon. The first ever, massive magnetosphere discovery by an inter-temporal solar system, will confirm this anomaly.\nIt also shows that the solar system was once an infinite universe. But now, we see more magnetospheres, which makes it impossible not to see the sun from Sedna.\n\"What we see in the sky is a very small sample,\" said Dr. Anup Saini, director of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"And by the way, this is probably one of the largest visible and faint magnetospheres in the sky. This is a really rare incident to be found out of the Solar System.\"\nTo discover Sedna, astronomers from the United States have developed a unique magnetometer detector. They have developed the instrument that works in conjunction with the US Geological Survey. The detector detects all manner of magnetic fields such as the sun, solar flares, magnetic fields and ionized particles, or colloids. The detector, which is currently under development, can detect all magnetic fields, including ionized particles.\nOn top of conducting the detector, researchers will then measure what type of magnetosphere Sedna has been located in. This information will be useful for future researchers to determine how other magnetospheres might have formed when Sedna was discovered.\n\"This is just one example of how many of the other magnetospheres that we can see have been found in both NASA-led and ground-based observatories. And it shows that these observations are of great significance,\" said NASA's Dr. Ayaan Singh, co-investigator on the magnetometer detector.\n\"These observations are important because the Solar System was once an infinite universe and now, we have more. And it is more difficult to see the sun from Sedna than for the Solar System to explain,\" said Kumar Rana, director of the Planetary Science Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt. \"And the findings from the detector are exciting for us because it will show where many other magnetospheres may have been discovered.\"\nExplore further: Scientists discover Sedna, and the Solar System before ever seeing sky\nMore information: Rajesh Sastry, Ayaan Singh, and Ayaan Singh, \"Sedna\/Yarnapatla-5.0\" (2019).

{"id":2148,"ended":false,"length":492,"text":"As stars of at least 0 @. @ 4 M \u2609 exhaust their supply of hydrogen at their core, they start to fuse hydrogen in a shell outside the helium core. Their atoms have a complex reaction with oxygen, which they create in a separate vessel. The first, the hydrogen, is fused together to form a liquid that can be boiled for gas, and oxygen is added through the core to build a liquid-like gas (aka liquid hydrogen). A liquid gas reacts with the helium and the hydrogen, then splits into gas, and the helium is used to make the liquid-like gas, and the liquid-like gas is combined with hydrogen to form a fuel. This fuel is then heated up by the oxygen and hydrogen to power their own spacecraft and has a hydrogen concentration of around 0.04m to 0.09m \/u\/s1s1s1. As the helium is cooled a few minutes after the cooling process, more than 90percent of the hydrogen is melted by steam that is generated in the hydrogen vessel. The fuel may have been stored in the fuel tank of a vacuum pump to feed the fuel to the spacecraft. As the helium has dried up, it then forms a gas to burn in the rocket and is then used to run the rocket. Over the next 48 hours, the helium is heated up to 1.9m \/u\/s1s1s1 and is then heated at a temperature of almost 90 degrees F (5.5 degrees C) while hydrogen is heated at about 15.5m\/s2a. Eventually the helium gas is burned out which is needed to make the rocket and fuel-cell powered vehicles.\n\nThe next stage in the research involves a new liquid fuel technology that is based on thermally-condensed hydrogen. They hope to have the fuel-cell powered vehicles made of thermally-combusted helium. For a test drive, they will conduct a series of tests. After each test, the team will design and measure the required temperature for the vehicle to be placed in orbit. If the device reaches the desired temperature, the vehicle will be ready to be used in space.\n\nIn the next few years, as more information is being obtained, it is expected that the test drive will be implemented for commercial applications as well. There is an idea that these vehicles will be the basis of an experimental fuel technology that can be used with solar arrays to make electrical energy more sustainable, because the energy consumption will be reduced by a factor of 2 or more after they are cooled down, and thus in a smaller area. The prototype rocket has an exhaust manifold that can be shaped to make it more environmentally sustainable and to create more fuel-cell powered vehicles.\n\nComments","token_len":553,"entropy":[10.4394,3.057,8.5788,0.0622,9.1337,11.0304,7.2779,5.5677,8.4986,7.1024,6.9073,3.0614,14.0459,7.9403,7.8329,0.9633,4.7241,3.718,4.2096,5.4488,1.9528,3.1525,4.9454,1.0956,6.1148,5.2637,3.411,2.1993,8.7308,7.8311,0.9734,6.0543,1.8489,0.8729,4.8993,6.1958,4.7885,1.8984,5.872,3.735,2.4539,3.1542,1.6564,1.9125,2.6919,5.0729,2.0621,1.7233,5.237,5.7094,1.5282,2.0097,4.8234,4.9532,2.9798,3.1861,2.4302,0.9324,5.8523,3.3899,2.8764,0.1653,1.2254,4.468,4.533,2.3454,0.4966,4.7142,3.1306,5.2777,2.3027,1.5799,5.8806,1.3731,1.9509,5.6116,1.4074,6.4892,1.2217,5.9664,1.7294,3.0013,3.4687,3.9758,2.7318,4.2182,5.7208,3.0392,1.5238,0.6325,3.9987,3.0508,3.004,6.0773,0.2702,2.0272,2.4673,2.3599,2.5148,1.4594,2.0701,3.864,5.9725,0.7972,3.7842,2.7016,1.7946,1.5241,3.2505,1.7013,4.0609,0.5809,2.1993,1.9695,1.9064,2.6579,0.1643,0.4505,2.6875,2.0975,1.2761,2.7388,1.5266,0.057,0.2123,0.7133,5.1875,0.3424,2.021,0.8133,0.2069,0.9015,5.2508,1.1065,2.404,3.7976,0.758,2.2373,2.9815,2.5381,2.0926,0.7459,5.131,1.6808,3.1614,2.0403,5.4627,3.5921,4.7822,6.0617,2.6975,6.7866,1.1556,5.6606,6.0815,0.262,2.7891,2.2793,0.0849,4.4135,6.6615,5.6407,0.5817,0.0113,4.0211,0.6984,6.4987,6.2444,0.0279,3.7536,5.6505,5.7532,2.2691,2.8429,1.1546,1.2131,4.3918,1.3571,3.5464,1.9312,2.1498,5.0465,4.1503,3.5272,2.4138,1.2943,5.5023,1.1952,0.5415,5.7208,3.8581,3.7487,10.5736,0.1119,0.2692,1.498,0.907,5.9657,3.364,6.1209,4.5863,1.466,4.0438,2.356,0.2592,3.7373,5.4684,0.5859,1.4573,3.7503,6.2671,3.1864,2.1268,3.5484,0.9919,1.1202,3.7686,1.8741,2.7717,1.436,6.92,3.529,3.4471,7.3476,1.0558,3.0201,1.0751,0.5012,1.4987,0.8754,3.6985,0.6239,2.553,3.8915,6.8909,1.9449,0.6973,1.9789,4.9312,3.8329,0.5829,2.8823,4.6703,4.4389,2.65,0.606,4.2283,2.7968,2.2372,1.7964,2.4804,0.6485,5.037,0.7487,3.1871,1.2994,6.7746,1.6258,1.6376,5.8472,0.1195,0.9013,0.5024,3.377,1.8529,2.5357,0.7433,1.1725,3.7553,0.613,3.3877,0.8045,1.9144,0.1177,0.0109,0.0227,0.4604,0.0271,0.0715,0.1944,0.0828,1.8471,2.8709,1.6777,2.8497,4.5935,1.7799,1.8698,0.276,6.0741,5.0167,1.0396,3.8974,2.1324,5.0837,1.2847,2.0671,0.8014,0.1893,1.2594,6.0086,4.9543,0.5662,1.6496,1.5366,2.3393,4.5287,2.6124,1.3479,0.3978,2.8801,0.2952,2.0712,4.925,1.7049,4.8295,1.1906,1.8498,4.7132,0.9706,4.6337,2.097,6.0117,1.3507,6.2922,0.392,3.0919,0.7917,1.9373,3.1571,3.3794,5.0623,3.6845,5.8134,4.6275,0.7467,1.6385,0.0297,2.1272,4.0183,1.6265,2.6921,0.3118,5.3469,3.4247,2.9681,3.6656,4.845,2.692,4.8397,2.0323,1.8861,2.797,0.0902,6.8557,2.5613,2.6282,6.0935,0.3743,1.5632,1.1266,6.166,4.847,0.3552,2.8184,2.2491,3.3181,2.9876,0.1858,1.4728,1.1431,6.1579,3.8608,4.2296,0.0399,0.085,8.8987,4.2625,3.5052,2.0309,5.3288,3.3741,4.8935,2.5391,0.9065,1.0916,1.4485,5.0594,1.0822,2.7051,0.0041,1.8398,4.1221,4.284,4.0224,0.6847,0.5893,0.9478,3.3909,0.3687,5.9307,1.2551,6.8367,0.5103,5.9589,2.6298,2.484,0.5739,2.4888,2.0792,1.7692,5.3564,1.0,3.0168,0.7366,3.8205,1.0249,5.3001,4.1676,1.6926,1.4468,0.2788,0.3718,0.8621,0.8434,0.3863,0.754,3.1415,0.7153,2.1772,2.7723,1.9709,2.1789,0.5741,1.1693,0.0004,3.4412,1.3951,1.306,2.0806,1.466,0.3141,4.7058,1.2318,4.1607,1.3678,5.3288,4.2145,1.7682,2.417,1.2005,1.4473,0.1029,0.8361,5.0624,3.07,0.7998,1.406,5.7963,3.8599,2.2443,2.4622,3.3956,0.2528,0.5454,4.9637,1.1834,3.4122,4.2197,1.0561,4.8178,1.3545,2.0201,0.6257,4.2183,2.4325,0.8847,3.5895,5.0647,5.7647,4.627,1.467,1.8822,0.4426,0.6167,5.1743,4.2219,2.8106,1.9295,3.8496,5.932,3.3464,5.0522,4.9434,2.4505,6.0528,2.0318,2.6961,4.5315,3.1244,0.4029,1.7572,1.7874,2.6527,0.318,0.0294,2.4177,2.2783,2.0428,6.251,4.1911,0.4061,4.6077,0.7969,3.3785,1.6198,4.3126,5.0819,1.9653,4.4031,2.471,0.5385,2.2361,5.1532,5.1904,3.0782,2.8894,6.134,4.0407,1.3714,1.5819,0.5486,6.8778,0.6296,3.8937,1.8991,2.276,4.9497,3.4765,2.7542,3.4018,4.5838,1.8155,2.3023,2.2251,0.9559,0.6766,0.1966,0.443,1.049,0.0003,5.7744]}
{"id":135,"ended":false,"length":480,"text":"In South Carolina, flooding associated with the cyclone was considered to be the worst since 1943. Over 5 inches ( 130 mm ) of rainfall was reported, while winds brought down trees, power lines, and other infrastructure.\n\nIn North Carolina, a tornado warning was issued for a large swath of southeast Texas while a winter storm was issued in southwestern NC, the Carolines, and parts of New Jersey.\n\nThere were no flooding warnings across southern North Carolina and South Carolina.\n\nIn North America, the hurricane season continues to be one of the harshest in history with up to 7 and 6 inches of rainfall occurring. That means most of the year will experience flooding, but not all of it.\n\nThe national average of 3.9 inches ( 10 mm ) of snowflakes fell to 2.09 inches (1.16 mm ) in New York on Tuesday. Most parts of South Carolina and much of New Jersey recorded more than that with 1.1 inches (2.06 mm ) in North Carolina.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, New York City recorded 0.8 inches ( 2.25 mm ) of snowfall and Charlotte, Charlotte-Mecklenburg, and Durham, Durham, and Greensboro recorded 0.9 inches ( 1.3 mm ) of snow.\n\nAnd in Colorado, the weather conditions caused more than a foot of snowfall, falling to 0.3 inches ( 0.11 mm ) in Colorado on Tuesday. In both cities temperatures ranged from -20 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.9 degrees Celsius ).\n\nFlooding is typically expected to continue through at least the middle of the next week, but the national average is expected to rise as temperatures rise again and temperatures drop.\n\n\"For the first time, the National Weather Service has issued snow warnings and warnings for this region of the country. We expect the most severe storm damage to develop as the next round of cold fronts approach,\" said John Harnett, the agency\u2019s meteorologist.\n\nThis season\u2019s storms are expected to push northeastward across the mountains and into the Pacific Ocean as strong high pressure pulls north in the next 24-48 hours.\n\nAs a precaution, some people in South Carolina are urged to prepare for flooding caused by the cyclone in an effort to protect themselves as much as possible.\n\n\u201cIf you were to go outside on March 28 and have your clothes, shoes, clothes and clothing on, you need to be prepared and stay ahead of any water or power disruptions,\" WNCN meteorologist Greg King said. \"If you are able to, have a water tank or whatever and you are making shelter \u2014 you can probably survive.\u201d","token_len":553,"entropy":[7.9075,2.3729,0.2954,10.4179,9.1483,0.0095,1.1882,7.2377,0.153,2.5073,4.6375,1.8025,0.2264,1.6391,2.318,3.1502,6.9497,0.7732,5.6158,4.7663,3.6857,1.7235,15.1389,1.6324,0.3417,0.0921,2.0572,1.3504,2.0634,2.6339,3.3679,5.273,6.5466,2.7735,2.8791,1.4226,3.4094,0.625,1.0692,0.8204,2.923,1.3617,0.4065,0.9227,0.0024,2.6658,3.6667,0.1994,0.096,2.938,3.8716,3.8044,0.5091,0.1077,0.7534,3.3838,3.6551,1.0691,0.0107,5.1988,3.7441,5.8264,1.6084,8.6241,0.2899,2.1916,3.6404,2.4648,5.1115,8.7317,2.694,3.7617,4.2196,12.8189,1.114,0.3243,2.6128,0.0067,3.4328,1.4423,0.3878,0.9897,0.0002,4.9234,0.7842,1.4048,8.2218,2.1355,4.8225,4.9624,3.2026,0.1982,2.5918,4.4774,0.0308,1.9229,0.7847,0.0002,2.2535,3.2543,5.4318,0.1946,1.9606,4.6828,0.7901,4.9267,1.5908,1.1169,3.1682,0.0392,0.1764,4.5608,0.0001,1.4515,2.5141,2.9427,4.9098,0.0015,4.0858,7.0751,5.8594,0.2476,0.6888,1.0358,5.1676,4.0881,6.2802,2.6751,4.8301,0.8168,0.1788,4.7018,3.5423,5.5753,3.7028,1.957,2.4629,3.5909,1.1215,1.4856,0.1853,0.7746,0.9392,0.0002,2.3902,6.4094,1.8171,2.8372,4.7914,0.9988,2.7337,0.0316,1.6455,4.9706,1.4894,0.0996,0.1046,5.9661,8.3614,0.006,3.3259,5.3042,4.1196,0.631,7.2335,0.0511,0.1272,5.6816,0.103,4.8132,0.3162,1.4521,0.8202,3.4214,0.4208,2.6318,2.3424,1.0007,5.7442,5.4231,0.0234,4.5694,0.2922,1.8487,6.6583,0.0067,2.3916,0.2661,4.8383,3.4252,0.443,5.1798,4.4004,2.6394,0.2674,3.8674,0.1052,0.58,3.4145,0.0761,4.5011,0.0171,1.3323,3.5895,4.4239,0.217,0.8556,0.3885,0.0002,4.8754,0.9116,2.2609,1.0305,0.0854,3.3848,0.4475,1.2495,2.1482,4.7454,0.032,2.9067,0.0285,0.1162,3.9032,0.0758,4.2573,0.004,0.0105,0.1173,0.4502,1.1721,2.2689,7.2041,1.9538,4.578,1.1397,0.0069,0.0012,0.0,0.0001,0.6424,0.5852,3.729,1.83,4.7273,2.178,1.3203,6.0329,0.0122,0.7752,0.9127,0.0053,2.4691,0.0767,0.0174,2.3895,0.0041,5.1711,0.0024,0.0287,0.3777,0.1763,1.1938,0.4128,0.0002,6.1614,1.9715,4.3709,0.2427,1.5991,3.9982,4.7296,5.6298,3.8906,0.4473,2.2007,1.8608,0.4834,0.4019,2.617,2.8817,5.5332,2.1173,3.4158,0.0033,2.4771,0.1191,0.0205,2.5998,0.0183,5.6429,0.0225,0.0915,0.4834,1.588,2.3042,0.2508,0.5132,3.763,4.5905,3.4064,6.6293,6.2698,0.2916,2.0241,3.1437,1.2445,1.5245,0.6837,5.7121,0.4114,3.3642,1.0633,0.0863,6.2347,0.4049,0.0002,5.9996,0.0364,0.5854,2.1678,4.7152,5.0871,1.0247,1.977,1.8786,5.5394,0.0067,1.0956,4.7452,0.0432,0.6347,3.6665,0.9142,1.453,1.5813,2.1496,6.0717,0.3871,1.579,0.5317,0.0398,3.3992,2.7536,2.8642,1.4988,4.6711,2.878,4.0254,3.0127,1.6706,0.5959,0.0003,3.5788,5.0134,1.152,1.3077,0.0433,2.0883,1.7805,2.0847,0.3379,0.002,0.9483,1.5232,4.7022,1.4293,4.328,2.4634,0.6389,4.518,4.1622,2.208,0.34,0.9335,2.8644,3.1295,2.1827,2.2839,4.205,0.6584,2.6497,5.7327,1.0923,5.6452,2.6733,1.2473,4.169,6.597,0.0172,4.9901,2.7159,4.4217,1.2667,0.6586,3.8842,4.2122,5.9449,1.4452,0.0869,2.3081,1.9972,13.8705,7.2377,3.3987,1.9235,0.141,0.3351,0.3802,0.0003,4.4622,4.9374,11.3738,0.4012,0.6218,3.9249,1.3934,1.3345,0.0211,5.7788,6.9284,2.234,3.6287,0.5681,8.0293,1.2376,2.0467,0.8989,4.4144,1.122,3.3404,4.8217,7.275,0.5019,5.4079,4.5109,4.7058,0.7594,2.3992,3.7142,4.0624,0.276,0.0069,0.4585,0.7233,0.0003,4.2851,2.7625,4.3909,0.5181,3.6761,3.7034,1.7891,3.7612,0.0827,1.671,4.5535,0.036,4.3357,0.4621,4.0714,6.5454,0.0202,1.3132,1.6673,0.0222,3.6737,5.1517,0.8523,0.0234,3.4103,1.2051,4.8065,2.5031,0.0368,0.0239,0.3451,0.425,0.0002,5.9472,5.9524,6.8851,0.2559,5.6436,1.9286,3.2565,2.5089,2.8271,6.8041,3.5862,2.2873,3.5271,2.8102,4.4903,4.7065,2.1036,0.1839,4.0404,2.1984,2.9885,1.8353,1.5637,1.7073,4.5125,0.1301,2.1008,0.5857,3.6374,3.1773,6.694,0.1335,2.8439,3.8751,2.7374,3.6704,3.5139,2.6817,6.1132,4.8768,4.6531,0.3663,0.0229,4.8379,6.2299,0.474,0.3116,1.9937,2.2535,0.239,1.3641,4.8442,0.1103,3.2089,5.8386,1.4474,4.1781,4.4356,2.0209,6.0235,3.759,2.9891,1.9235,5.8211,7.139,7.323,2.5188,2.0483,4.8811,3.7495,2.3385,5.6438,6.4055]}

The story, written by John Noble, tells how the web-based comic-cozy new-media comic television show \"Arrowstreet\" will go from one publisher to another if it takes on ABC.\n\nBut there are also certain problems:\n\nThe most famous issues are not as popular as those of today's other shows;\n\nYou wouldn't have recognized either the cartoon or the film characters in the stories until you looked at the comic books.\n\nYou'd never know in the years since the comics first started, that more than 100,000 people signed up to watch \"Arrowstreet.\"\n\nIn fact, it had been only a few weeks that ABC had ever held a cartoon show on TV, and that network was still not giving much coverage to \"Arrowstreet,\"\n\nBy the time it finished playing on television in 2008, it was more than 100 episodes long.\n\nFor all the attention that \"Arrowstreet\" has received since it was first announced in 2010, almost no one knows whether it will earn Emmy consideration.\n\n\"It was the most successful story that could come out of TV and the most successful thing that could happen to HBO in the history of television,\" said Tonya Hockman, executive producer of \"Arrowstreet\" and who first broadcast the script two years ago.\n\nHockman said the show has sold well on the air and has earned a spot in the history of the network.\n\nIt will be the first studio comedy to air on cable TV again.\n\n\"We know very well what is coming next year and even better that \"Arrowstreet\" will be aired as a three-part series at ABC during the fall show,\" she said. \"That will tell us what the future holds for the network and the stories we tell for its programming.\"\n\nAt least 1,600 stories have appeared at ABC since 2006 and a record 24 shows have streamed on the network's new streaming service, Zine News.

{"id":64,"ended":false,"length":464,"text":"The storyline concerning the assassination primarily follows the four conspirators who directly participate in Trujillo's death. Antonio Imbert Barrera is one of the few conspirators who survives the violent reprisals that follow Trujillo'S reign, and is one of the four conspirator who suffers from physical and mental incapacity to resist the attack, while being a victim of an unseen assassin-like force.\n\nRevenge of the Roses\nIn season three, Trujillo, the man who shot El Cortego during the confrontation with Cabral, confronts Cabral in the garden of their apartment. The four men, who are named as Antony, Estelio, Alberto, and Guillermo, are shot dead by Cabral when he attempts to flee. Trujillo responds with a brutal killing in which Antony attempts to blow them up. The incident is part of the \"Spirits\" series, which is produced by the same company as \"The X-Files\", and in which Cabral is the villain that is in charge of the plot.\n\nIn the series' finale, Cabral is given his name by his followers, with Antony leading him to a mysterious tomb of his mother which he finds and takes him in to his own soul. His fate, as described by Cabral, becomes clear when the four criminals, Antony, Estelio, Alberto and Guillermo, enter the building.\n\nAntony, who is at first frightened that their escape might be a suicide, is stabbed to death by the four men who are killed when he takes them to their personal tomb. They are shot dead by Cabral himself and taken to their tomb.\n\nWhen the crime scene is revealed, Antony is presented with signs of the murder and is immediately killed in a fiery car blast. He is only seen by his relatives and friends following the explosion.\n\nCast\n\nChances are that the season three cast can be credited with giving each episode different title and ending credits credits of scenes.\n\nIn the series it was reported that a small number of cast members did not know the title of the plot, especially as they are usually given short episodes. So it is unlikely that they were allowed to start with the characters.\n\nCultural references\nAncestors\nThe Spanish-language radio program La Repara del Rey, which was broadcast on July 23, 1960, was inspired by the assassination of Trujillo, and a song from the song \"Trujillo\" was sung by Antony and Estelio, while Estelio and Alberto sang \"O Vida\" and \"Carmen\" with Antony and Estelio.\n\nReferences","token_len":554,"entropy":[10.4016,8.5062,1.2494,6.2345,11.5648,3.9163,1.02,6.9579,6.3167,0.0513,1.9369,8.5019,4.8337,0.0389,13.6055,2.1938,0.0012,0.1166,3.3099,0.8509,10.1092,9.2799,5.4672,8.6447,2.5877,1.9759,2.774,0.0664,0.4654,5.239,1.4462,0.0101,1.2179,3.9268,1.1842,7.1562,7.2539,1.8615,0.0012,2.8919,2.7017,1.855,0.0058,0.0004,9.4806,6.7478,6.672,2.2722,1.2974,2.0095,3.5292,0.0332,0.3813,3.3063,2.3896,6.6681,1.6664,6.714,1.4262,6.5651,1.3206,0.4891,4.7638,0.0072,1.7867,3.5948,1.2215,5.192,2.8784,2.7372,3.9545,4.1464,3.7759,0.0737,3.5251,5.2268,3.3203,7.0219,2.7548,1.3529,0.7329,1.4028,0.0009,5.9934,1.5644,2.1812,0.5766,10.1086,0.8501,16.9984,6.5488,1.8748,0.4344,1.3104,0.0148,0.0015,3.5873,2.9342,4.6296,0.7142,5.1411,7.0666,5.3644,6.9238,1.159,4.6983,0.6172,5.6333,1.1927,5.9392,3.1511,0.3867,5.6234,3.3657,0.0296,2.5989,1.1198,5.9088,1.1083,4.5563,2.2785,1.1942,2.3731,4.3973,2.4142,3.0409,1.9317,1.4777,5.103,2.9906,4.8813,3.6127,1.7479,7.7378,4.0302,2.9775,0.2728,5.5264,0.5128,0.4638,4.9435,0.8425,0.0014,0.4223,1.9665,5.1409,2.9844,0.7566,2.3055,0.0041,4.8996,2.1183,2.907,0.0295,3.5434,1.5176,2.0992,0.0077,0.0005,6.9559,2.1611,0.7936,5.101,3.4587,4.7948,0.9648,3.7733,0.0082,5.4958,0.0387,5.5137,5.6877,0.5928,1.8733,2.258,5.8508,1.6588,4.7242,0.0481,1.0549,3.6719,5.5103,4.8901,0.9718,1.8462,2.4252,0.8375,1.188,2.4134,5.7618,0.1637,2.352,3.8646,2.0073,1.3929,1.8348,1.4284,5.4663,0.2836,0.0801,2.3137,1.7907,4.9993,0.8511,5.4382,0.015,1.7051,2.715,3.3935,5.0247,2.3851,4.9725,0.9089,0.557,0.5684,1.7856,0.4965,0.8231,0.0002,1.9152,2.0118,3.1009,2.6121,4.1131,0.1996,3.7562,0.0124,1.7129,4.9516,3.3754,6.0382,2.0726,2.5497,5.245,1.1855,4.9423,3.981,0.0239,5.5059,2.2983,0.807,2.6015,4.5643,4.3614,4.3828,2.7492,5.1974,4.6331,1.6375,3.0434,3.361,3.7572,2.7657,3.4498,2.2369,5.5047,3.6942,8.6331,0.6644,4.4831,4.6559,3.8705,1.8451,3.8777,1.033,4.4055,0.0051,0.9196,5.6356,2.0823,1.0508,2.3786,3.1149,7.2007,2.7552,4.3505,0.051,0.1492,0.9062,0.0028,0.0032,0.0561,1.9444,2.3528,0.1936,0.0265,0.002,0.26,4.1262,0.6227,6.2749,1.8628,2.6526,0.0001,6.1503,0.0308,2.1237,1.8518,1.1729,5.3577,1.3712,4.7463,4.2954,5.4621,3.7378,3.2004,1.3675,1.9902,3.8557,1.2611,2.3342,5.6708,1.7776,0.015,0.7145,1.8749,0.9966,1.4388,3.3414,2.2061,4.8506,4.0188,1.4103,4.7864,1.5935,1.4854,3.6495,6.1585,1.7885,0.5572,3.9308,1.3643,5.127,2.2241,0.5667,1.8913,0.0038,4.2801,2.76,4.0502,0.3281,2.5973,3.2642,1.0296,1.6263,0.0002,4.1897,1.6422,6.2119,2.2597,0.9989,2.4389,1.206,1.7426,0.0056,1.6712,5.4736,0.8068,7.822,0.724,2.5827,3.4745,2.2765,2.4444,4.0317,3.5204,3.2249,1.8231,5.6879,3.7759,5.7409,0.5905,1.9724,0.8943,5.3816,4.0095,2.9632,1.4648,5.5061,1.5903,1.3714,6.0448,0.4776,4.4193,0.7911,0.8073,0.0002,4.5692,1.3149,0.0002,6.5358,4.0137,4.1749,1.5484,2.1515,5.9576,1.2128,2.9249,6.4612,0.8308,5.4551,0.9112,4.3774,6.4313,3.2554,6.9881,8.1336,2.3065,4.0188,4.4063,10.172,5.9605,9.9177,3.2579,1.34,0.0002,3.3547,1.3531,2.9894,8.1167,1.8491,4.1029,0.1434,4.3652,5.0901,1.8357,0.0121,3.9812,0.2018,3.9508,0.2527,3.3173,1.9987,2.992,0.262,0.6702,6.4206,1.691,5.2566,3.8558,1.5421,3.6215,4.1384,3.8725,4.9346,4.6431,1.9281,5.8693,2.2691,1.233,4.2488,0.2216,1.9402,2.2071,5.4693,0.1315,5.9111,2.8083,1.0187,4.8511,2.7072,0.6401,0.0002,4.4525,3.8868,1.2657,0.2319,20.4052,5.8587,1.828,1.1293,15.587,5.5114,3.2864,1.706,6.2956,2.4481,4.6336,5.7593,11.7164,4.0874,3.4618,2.224,1.4435,2.2684,1.5097,1.3558,3.8644,3.2287,0.2183,4.7001,0.3741,2.3244,5.7531,0.0661,0.7551,6.0331,0.2148,1.8747,0.0046,0.0007,2.1085,1.7219,4.5721,4.4651,3.3117,0.9579,1.7015,1.2339,3.591,0.2711,0.0418,0.0033,2.2326,0.8316,2.032,0.7166,3.3594,0.1204,2.0347,2.7675,0.0021,0.002,2.7147,3.734,6.4284,0.0183,0.0022,2.8437,4.3109,3.1629,1.3864,4.6,5.8162,1.7503,2.4209,1.9191,0.4194,3.3743,5.4267,1.4355,2.0735,4.2224,3.1204,0.0156,1.3248,0.9102,0.0013,0.0014,0.5538,0.7155,0.0002,3.8936]}
{"id":681,"ended":true,"length":488,"text":"NASA has speculated on the feasibility of mining the atmospheres of the outer planets, particularly for helium @ - @ 3, an isotope of helium that is rare on Earth and could have powerful anti-gravity properties, as well as an impact-limiting atmosphere around an inter-planetary body @ \u2013 4, or a planet that washes in liquid gas, perhaps from the Moon or Saturn. But now, they have more data indicating the possibility of such a space venture \u2014 the \u201cFossil Magnetic Field\u201d model, reports CNET.\n\nThis is one of the first times we have ever seen an \u201cartificial\u201d mass of fuel on an orbiting planet, which has a gravity of about 100 times that of Earth, and has a mass of more than 11.5 tons to its name. Our first instance occurred at the Kennedy Space Center \u2014 at 3:35 pm ET a few years ago.\n\nAccording to the model, planets could hold the same mass and could orbit in the red, while a gravity of approximately 50 times more than Earth\u2019s would fit into the same space, with gravitational waves from the atmosphere, or possibly other signals of pressure, to detect gravitational interactions.\n\nWe expect to find an \u201cartificial\u201d mass of fuel on the Earth, around 500 million kilometers in diameter \u2014 which is approximately double the size of an average human. If it were to be the case, it would amount to more than 2.4 million hydrogen per cubic meter (bcfm), equivalent to five times the size of earth, and equivalent to 527 times the mass of the sun.\n\nAs we report earlier (as opposed to the \u201cartificial\u201d mass by the way), these parameters of mass and gravity could allow this planet to \u201chold the same mass and could orbit in the red,\u201d and \u201cconduct gravitational waves as well as others to detect gravitational interactions like the ones seen in Earth.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not too difficult to imagine Earth-size Mars Mars.\n\nThe model is already being used in an asteroid-like space mission that will test the ability of extraterrestrial life on Mars. Last year, it was designed to measure what would be the amount of oxygen in the Martian atmosphere, and how it would affect the life of the surrounding Martian surface.\n\nAt least 1,600 asteroids have been placed on the planet in a series of experiments designed to gather dust and other data about the interior of the planet. This may indicate that it is a \u201csupernova,\u201d or a \u201cdisaster,\u201d or may be even more powerful \u2014 or perhaps more deadly \u2014 than we have thought.","token_len":554,"entropy":[5.2603,8.5876,3.0321,1.2199,4.8479,0.0604,6.7692,2.2284,7.7599,0.0083,0.1387,2.0399,4.0243,1.6183,1.7868,5.1869,3.8004,7.0061,12.6593,6.6076,6.9885,3.608,2.5013,9.7645,4.7281,0.1692,0.7867,0.5119,2.169,1.0169,5.374,3.9127,0.8461,2.2912,3.886,3.2677,5.8977,4.4159,0.0222,0.7265,0.9847,2.5828,3.2722,0.7992,0.0316,3.9179,4.1099,2.8172,4.6045,0.019,7.0316,6.2123,4.9647,4.9617,1.8262,0.9692,0.0001,2.4758,7.2788,6.9624,4.0425,0.6662,3.4576,1.7133,4.4911,2.1553,4.4819,7.9974,3.4849,2.8651,3.0579,2.5321,4.0528,4.2753,1.6977,5.7409,1.9319,4.5296,1.0039,3.9358,4.4166,1.2521,4.8931,0.7613,5.649,2.8501,5.1286,2.4767,2.0356,0.6,2.9801,0.6114,5.1146,8.5202,4.7072,3.5257,14.977,6.2343,5.8233,3.4548,0.012,7.6656,3.3705,2.3654,7.0114,6.3882,1.682,8.7628,6.0418,3.2128,0.3543,0.3746,0.0003,3.7404,1.9357,3.7888,0.2604,0.489,2.2035,3.8042,2.708,1.0086,2.9891,1.3429,2.3405,8.8612,0.0848,10.1848,0.1248,6.0098,3.2623,6.8412,2.2785,7.178,3.6214,2.3774,3.6097,1.4507,1.3025,2.8498,3.0105,2.5659,4.4942,0.6949,1.754,3.8415,1.3875,0.997,0.0717,0.5112,1.3074,1.6259,2.8041,1.3468,1.8364,0.7015,4.0397,0.0333,4.9553,2.9683,0.9646,3.6218,6.0173,4.0451,4.3011,0.4675,6.169,3.0919,7.4263,5.464,3.3505,1.3005,5.5496,0.005,0.0191,5.5134,4.2564,4.3248,2.2033,4.0376,2.415,1.4657,6.5545,1.319,1.6753,0.2188,1.1717,1.487,0.0002,4.6809,0.0047,1.3121,2.9423,0.1793,5.1727,3.9661,3.9315,3.6197,3.4046,1.9141,2.8847,7.0082,4.2013,2.7745,1.4492,8.1464,2.8229,4.1649,3.2408,6.5702,0.4526,5.277,3.4994,0.7575,4.1876,1.3066,0.2781,11.5138,5.073,5.0747,1.8381,7.1353,2.7875,0.7521,4.1455,4.2572,2.9229,2.6737,5.4807,3.9021,4.0607,1.2075,6.0183,3.5002,2.9172,5.1932,3.1719,5.9537,3.399,5.9873,1.8515,5.1564,6.7406,3.1327,4.0301,0.9918,0.8664,0.0002,4.6613,5.7045,1.7438,1.6926,3.866,4.9433,0.0603,3.0986,0.0051,0.5023,0.0099,0.0705,0.3774,1.6051,0.7632,2.1982,4.4293,1.848,5.8902,6.7716,2.7952,3.0092,3.0682,0.3201,3.0541,2.8434,1.0973,4.9126,5.0516,0.5065,4.0244,0.0867,4.7241,3.2847,1.7491,4.1184,3.9196,2.6621,1.5948,1.2738,1.6472,4.6481,2.1266,0.7161,1.809,0.3352,6.4686,0.0174,3.6793,0.022,3.5559,1.1199,2.6223,2.8587,6.0989,2.7478,2.0282,0.6296,2.066,4.4646,4.2476,2.3839,1.0882,4.4813,0.0285,6.4915,0.418,0.6417,3.8324,0.0202,5.636,1.9978,1.3232,6.1484,0.0307,4.974,6.3119,1.3721,0.5349,0.6156,0.0389,0.9088,1.0745,0.3509,0.5612,0.0002,4.3515,2.7368,6.9505,5.2602,5.0049,4.2847,6.4293,0.0023,1.6921,3.4154,0.3425,3.1617,0.0556,0.0673,0.0135,0.3243,6.5931,2.8144,2.0492,0.6298,4.2189,6.4163,4.206,2.8936,1.7834,1.5024,3.0676,4.1957,5.5501,4.5356,0.1333,12.9334,0.1287,5.2634,1.4743,0.5756,0.4338,1.0509,5.6973,1.852,0.6058,0.1979,1.3142,0.7752,11.3116,6.8859,2.5158,4.6805,0.0509,7.279,1.639,0.1879,4.1739,1.2736,1.1554,7.2949,1.4933,0.2889,0.786,0.2925,5.4396,2.0322,2.819,2.9031,1.2084,3.7505,2.4648,7.5676,3.577,0.5012,0.0002,3.8898,9.6299,3.9159,0.759,2.4701,3.1617,4.1223,0.1457,1.3587,6.2952,3.5392,4.0096,6.9229,7.1165,3.7378,2.3322,0.0002,2.6279,3.2325,2.1662,5.6185,2.0881,1.2308,1.896,4.7931,4.3827,2.4985,2.693,4.57,1.523,3.5512,2.5952,4.4603,1.2508,4.6896,0.1772,3.5041,0.179,1.5763,1.9737,2.1632,1.0148,5.2842,0.6648,0.3629,3.9486,0.442,6.5144,0.72,4.5855,5.2484,2.6974,1.4781,1.7886,4.0604,0.0457,4.2059,1.1686,1.0661,1.7021,0.2346,1.3411,1.0706,2.218,2.6929,0.8842,1.7744,0.7279,4.4235,0.9546,1.244,5.2825,5.0202,2.579,0.3171,0.8511,0.0002,5.0227,3.7119,4.3383,0.8968,3.5044,5.4614,1.9405,0.2486,6.1784,1.2739,0.9817,3.6577,3.0561,3.3851,2.3613,0.0713,2.5821,3.6974,0.1205,4.8224,5.7113,1.7008,1.5773,5.1147,1.9067,0.8728,3.9707,0.5993,0.6828,1.0518,0.658,3.466,4.8129,4.6483,0.8358,3.5491,1.2368,2.6005,7.9926,0.0609,7.5752,4.3203,3.7757,2.0315,2.509,2.0305,1.2488,3.487,0.0781,5.5297,0.1116,1.4174,0.7049,1.6689,1.673,5.7215,1.1971,4.414,2.6781,3.4341,4.285,3.1983,2.2594,2.509,4.8151,0.7998,0.2224,3.0036,1.8498,4.3915,0.2949]}
{"id":1067,"ended":false,"length":493,"text":"Following his election, O 'Malley's first personnel decision was to retain the director of the city's economic development agency. O 'Malley had his transition team, and had them compile policy recommendations that would be considered by city officials. They were delivered a month into the month, before the mayor signed the budget proposal on Feb. 22. This means that he'll be the first in Washington since 1969 to formally have a mayor-designate.\n\nWith the budget proposal not accepting the mayor\u2019s name, O 'Malley was forced to issue a statement.\n\n\u201cToday, I decided and approved the budget, which includes all of city government's priorities,'' O'Malley said in an interview after the budget deal was approved.\n\nThe City Council and the state General Assembly have approved the budget to establish a mayor-citywide mayor-executive council with a budget of $35 million. City leaders are to select eight officers to serve as executive council members. O'Malley is expected to replace Steve Kocas, who served as mayor last year, who resigned. The city's $20 million budget will also give the mayor a seat on the council. A handful of candidates, some of whom O'Malley has long admired, are vying for city council seats.\n\nThe budget proposal calls for the city to make $1 million in federal dollars to spend on an economic development fund and $1 million in state funds to fund the mayor's office.\n\nO'Malley has long said he will not seek re-election this year but also has been critical of Republicans who have ruled the city for the last 17 years and who are pushing to end a program targeting the mentally handicapped.\n\n\"Those of us who were actually responsible didn't have any money. Our work was done by local officials, and most of this isn't going to be done by the state,\" O'Malley said in 2015. He also said he would like to see more diversity in the city office of city leaders.\n\nIn addition to the mayor-designate, O'Malley wants the mayor-executive council to be independent and appoint independent local officials instead of the city's elected directors. That would create a city budget with a five-member executive council and a nine-member executive council. The office would focus on economic development.\n\nThere was an immediate backlash from the governor's office, with some accusing him of not spending enough money on downtown businesses.

When he was sent to Europe as a foreign correspondent, Mercedes asked him to come back to Mexico.\n\nIn addition to that, they also arranged special trips to Barcelona and Madrid, while they made two attempts to visit the Grand Canal, the largest in Europe. \"I really have a feeling she had an experience like the first time\", says Garcia M\u00e1rquez.\n\nPor su parte, Mercedes C\u00e9sar M\u00e1rquez and Miguel Angel Gonz\u00e1lez\n\nAnd later on, Mercedes wanted him to play in two games for Barcelona against Madrid in Europe (one on Sunday afternoon, one tomorrow).\n\n\"It was a great chance for me to really gain experience and really learn some new things - there was no time like that \".\n\n\"I got to experience a world that's so different than anything I experienced\"\n\n\"The trip felt like it was like a dream\"\n\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez has also given his approval to his son Miguel, who has become active on social networks and joined his mother in the same way.\n\n\"I really have a feeling she had an experience like the first time\", says Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez. \"She really didn't get excited about this, she just knew it would be a beautiful city\"\n\nIn fact, Barcelona is not the only one with a strong desire of seeing their city transform. Earlier this year, many of the other European cities with a strong interest in the Spanish capital are considering establishing their own national teams.\n\nAnd although the Spanish capital has certainly had a fantastic start to the new year with the new elections in Spain, the situation remains dire.\n\nThe first step towards a change in regional management has already been reached. According to a European soccer body, the country will be able to form a 'Supervisory Authority' with all 16 members of the European Football Federation.\n\nAnd according to the Spanish soccer federation, the national team players will be free to compete as often as they want.\n\nThe players will now be able to earn a club budget of between \u20ac300 to \u20ac500 per match, depending on their contribution. The club budget is being prepared and the decision on the amount of funding for the project is subject to final approvals.

{"id":4009,"ended":true,"length":523,"text":"Since plasmas are very good electrical conductors, electric potentials play an important role. The potential as it exists on average in the space between charged particles, independent of the question of how much the particles are exposed to charge, is approximately equal to a given theoretical capacity. The electric potentials of the plasmas is a function of the charged-energy density, the charge loss coefficient and the ion current density (i.e., of the ion wave length). Thus we may see the potential being slightly smaller than that of electrons, or the potential being much smaller than that of ions.\n\nIf and when theoretical capacity is measured and determined by the electron distribution equation we can conclude that electrons are the most likely to form ions.\n\nBut there are also certain problems. In one way the potential to form ions is already different than the potential in other words the potential to form electrons is less relevant to the electron distribution equation.\n\nOf course there are many other problems which we have to focus on because we will most certainly be able to identify which kinds of ions are most likely. But I would like to concentrate on a few of those and give my own opinion on certain of them.\n\nI agree with the question about potential between charged particles, how big have they been to form (partially or whole) the electrons\n\nI will use the same answer as always. When we know that electrons are the most likely to form the ions there is a good case that there will be more electrons than there is of known potential. I just use the same idea that potential between charged particles would be larger than potential between electrons.\n\nBut there are also certain problems.

In episode 2, we saw the ladies are getting ready for a meal at the restaurant when Robin, Robin and Susan decide to go see the restaurant, which seems to have a connection to their relationship. Meanwhile, we saw that Susan is upset about her own mother's absence from the restaurant. So it is understandable that they want to see if they can talk. Now we can only hope that Robin, Robin and Susan would be able to reunite, and we are very excited for them to do so.

{"id":2725,"ended":true,"length":528,"text":"Although Douglas grew up in an Episcopalian household, she described herself as agnostic throughout her life, and forbade any religious ceremony at her memorial. Douglas tied her agnosticism to her unanswered prayers, and she became the patron of prayer group. Her first prayer for Jesus was \"Lord, I thank you for the good things done by you. \"\nSome time later, Douglas died from an internal heart attack. Her father was buried in an old oak grove outside St. Peters, Kansas.\n\"In spite of what people did to her, she would make friends,\" said John Hager, a lawyer and Douglas' stepfather. \"She wanted to make people happy. She always believed that God had mercy on her. When she got hurt, there were problems with her... She knew that she was not as good as she thought she was at God and that her pain was not the good that God gave to her.. \"\nDouglas was admitted to St. Peter's Hospital in June 1968 and was in remission for 14 years. Her life was filled with God's mercies. She was known to ask God for a prayer for her boyfriend and, as such, frequently wanted to say \"Honey, please forgive me... the Lord gave me strength... I am begging you for forgiveness, my darling\"\n\"She was a devoted wife and mother of Jesus. She was always ready to serve. She loved the Lord God gave her to serve. To this day, she is known as \u201cLittle Mother\u201d.\"\nBut many of the other victims of this heinous crime still believe that at some point that day the Lord allowed Douglas a special blessing.\n\"How beautiful that she would remember that, by the grace of her Father, this day, she will go on to have a day of forgiveness,\" said James Hager, Douglas' stepfather. \"I know it will be the day that he will be able to look up and say, 'May I bless you with prayer for this day too.'\n\"She is always looking down her finger and saying, 'May God please bless me...\"\nJames said that in the next few years, as more victims of this crime have been identified, his hope will be that Douglas' death will not only be a wake-up call for law enforcement, but also for individuals suffering from similar mental disease.\n\"If she can do it again, she can do it again by living with the grief she caused,\" said Hager. \"That is why she had those very powerful words,\" said Hager, who has recently been married to Douglas' stepson Jeff. Together, they have nine grandchildren. In the next few years, they plan to live with Douglas until her passing.","token_len":558,"entropy":[11.3097,6.6491,0.3878,0.8082,4.2329,8.3398,0.3936,0.0015,0.0015,1.5669,0.5422,3.9328,5.9972,2.7735,0.15,7.4005,0.0326,7.604,1.0322,0.8475,1.7435,1.507,9.9459,0.0163,2.578,2.8353,5.9623,3.7444,2.5734,9.1377,3.13,2.5775,9.9672,1.0857,9.6911,1.3622,0.2479,0.0438,0.218,1.1575,13.4658,4.0467,1.1048,1.0426,2.0171,4.3058,3.2453,5.0685,1.4775,4.6262,5.8427,5.8198,3.5567,4.1738,2.6481,4.2752,3.2417,0.6814,2.137,3.2551,0.45,3.2971,4.5616,0.275,0.9823,2.2526,4.7092,2.5903,6.6162,1.8921,1.1413,2.5225,5.3104,1.6549,12.2013,3.4557,1.3437,0.1786,0.8713,4.8598,2.9086,2.7559,5.6658,2.131,0.2622,1.0586,2.2,3.9644,2.4269,5.1136,0.6493,3.4426,4.8483,4.8689,2.3427,0.005,4.0328,4.0067,0.0787,5.4284,1.321,4.9697,1.0,1.8136,2.6803,4.1322,4.5369,0.0081,3.3043,3.7856,5.5086,0.5226,1.6047,0.5012,1.1342,4.0084,5.0795,4.6399,2.4688,1.6596,4.7628,4.2218,4.9667,2.26,1.8688,5.3603,1.6289,4.4599,0.6269,4.4895,0.4018,0.2689,0.5718,0.786,5.3917,0.3349,3.6109,3.375,2.0691,1.2888,0.8349,3.8877,4.1646,1.3033,2.2829,2.6044,5.1884,0.2047,0.4767,1.5085,3.6964,0.8328,3.2075,4.1968,0.3476,4.6257,1.7005,6.2277,1.43,0.6567,7.5912,1.57,4.6198,1.3087,1.5788,1.3741,2.4179,5.5022,1.3938,0.226,0.6775,1.0729,0.5702,0.0646,5.3975,3.7582,4.6242,1.3036,3.1039,5.2654,0.7146,1.6067,3.5733,6.5488,2.7855,1.1246,3.6581,2.622,0.1946,9.64,2.1441,0.151,1.8504,0.0,1.937,6.5674,0.2011,1.2685,0.015,2.2015,0.2295,0.65,0.8302,4.5865,4.1258,2.0812,1.8444,4.3126,4.2487,0.5671,5.637,1.6255,0.3102,2.2741,3.9953,1.1099,5.1888,0.0204,7.3914,0.4031,5.4759,0.1245,1.1884,1.5603,1.8543,4.7932,1.4161,5.2503,1.9011,1.1696,3.5998,4.4936,1.8474,0.4225,7.2854,2.6494,5.0411,2.7945,3.9905,0.0143,6.2018,6.0735,0.3804,4.8983,2.1423,5.1662,2.4914,0.3628,3.0977,1.8244,0.1773,5.2189,5.4791,1.883,3.2648,0.3407,5.075,2.9189,1.3396,1.7033,6.8898,0.6219,2.613,1.4251,2.7341,3.4168,5.3291,4.1821,2.2838,2.6994,1.7988,1.2947,1.8395,4.9398,2.7535,1.2599,0.6726,3.1496,8.1271,2.0911,0.7,1.5461,2.3746,3.8621,0.2815,5.0772,2.3854,0.6244,2.6718,2.6751,0.8667,5.186,8.9376,0.4251,3.1857,2.9298,1.2638,5.966,4.6028,0.0396,0.5116,0.7219,1.8537,4.0287,0.8637,13.7926,6.1995,8.428,5.9471,3.1176,8.5611,2.2636,0.418,5.6984,4.9449,1.8193,1.8844,4.2649,4.7143,0.5871,4.4428,4.9946,0.7515,5.1551,3.0156,0.845,7.3527,2.0188,0.1204,5.4504,2.5049,3.9584,4.2019,5.2785,0.7615,4.5369,4.0578,2.3778,1.5184,1.3561,0.7058,6.1928,5.2028,2.5189,1.772,3.2983,5.5487,2.0485,4.0583,5.5812,2.2916,0.3102,0.0637,4.6411,3.4859,0.79,4.3424,3.2631,3.2597,2.2067,2.1985,4.9769,2.498,0.8613,2.9892,1.1371,7.3813,0.9038,4.883,1.9604,0.2854,5.3876,3.9141,0.2653,0.83,1.1848,0.2002,0.4542,0.1549,0.1534,0.9409,2.4594,2.7941,2.9379,2.6677,0.7421,3.5775,2.1995,1.3542,3.8672,1.8852,3.1495,2.2218,0.0099,4.7122,2.3206,2.1029,1.1084,0.7404,0.1711,6.031,1.4762,3.0535,0.2394,2.9098,6.7382,2.1486,2.5659,1.4692,6.7751,3.2576,4.0712,0.3982,4.4517,3.1861,3.6483,3.161,5.4334,4.6292,7.8706,1.8931,1.61,0.3844,0.0909,3.5313,1.4727,6.5036,1.1034,0.391,8.8122,0.794,6.6671,3.9691,1.2787,3.8149,1.5823,4.4292,0.9219,1.0652,0.817,5.1052,3.4849,3.1171,1.1893,0.859,1.0516,3.7355,1.6587,1.9979,0.2638,4.0385,3.6883,1.4244,1.6371,0.8574,1.4311,1.6922,3.8226,0.4597,2.9365,1.4975,1.4035,2.4332,3.5345,0.3329,0.0028,0.001,0.9448,6.3093,0.1388,1.0625,0.0761,0.9733,1.1223,5.6649,5.2962,0.2691,3.4133,2.2897,6.0287,0.3766,0.4014,0.6819,3.2553,2.7115,3.3418,3.286,1.5552,3.3517,0.4114,1.6049,1.7437,1.6074,0.1138,0.7633,6.4814,5.5913,2.3259,1.9351,6.1371,2.703,3.6705,1.3178,1.0088,1.1068,0.0005,0.0615,0.8293,3.6145,1.6194,2.9201,1.2416,5.0358,6.6252,5.1369,5.4004,1.4009,6.635,2.8184,1.4499,0.0016,1.6483,1.1378,2.3467,5.3696,1.5328,4.7781,0.3795,0.8757,0.9521,0.95,3.023,7.9545,0.683,9.2451,0.362,0.4915,2.0407,6.9682,2.4169,0.661,5.3686,2.3167,3.2204,0.7764,0.4157,0.0828,1.5513,1.3982,0.123,5.1215,1.5759,0.8679,4.0228,2.2096,4.8576,0.2938]}

{"id":755,"ended":false,"length":472,"text":"When Tintin in the Congo was first released by the series'Scandinavian publishers in 1975, they objected to page 56, where Tintin drills a hole into a live rhinoceros, fills it with oil, and then returns it to the rhinoceros for a re-enactment. The story, which begins while a small group of boys in Ruhr, east of Belgrade, is still under construction (see film below ).\n\nThis is the story we got from the 'Finnish Press' website, which publishes the stories and articles collected by the Tintin gang. The 'finnish press' is one of the biggest and most influential publishers of English-language fiction. To get our full story, click here.\n\nWhen it was first released in 1984 on DVD as a four-part 'Finnish Press' magazine, it received critical and cultural acclaim, but a few years after it appeared in print in English format, it was discontinued due to the lack of publication in Belgium or Greece. In 2003, the company acquired the rights to the story by virtue of an agreement that required it to appear in all major English-language films and series of films, as well as to cover the whole UK and European cinema sphere.\n\nSo what did the Tintin gang want the title for?\n\nWe wanted to make sure we had an authentic story that fit in the modern cultural context, although the story itself was somewhat inspired by the 'Dutch Press' website and is of Belgian origin. Since we had just finished the series of films which followed Tintin, we needed to make sure the content could not be adapted into a 'finnish' film.\n\nWhat about the 'finnish press' and the 'European Press'?\n\nHaving heard of the 'eupeens' website, we thought to put the piece under a Creative Commons License as well as copyright protection.

During her campaign for the bill, a skeleton from her college days is found at the bottom of the stairs of the hallway in a dark corner of the lobby, and she is brought down, while Claire is still standing, by a loud clanging. The last panel of the show is where Claire goes to to talk to the people behind her on the stand at the back of her room. As we all know, a lot of sexual assault prevention legislation has focused on girls under 18. Claire is one of the most powerful women in the show and a woman with a very strong social media following. The actress has been known to ask girls who are in prison for sexual assault, or have been victimized by female perpetrators themselves and to publicly advocate for their rights. In the second panel, Claire asks one of the guards where she is. The guards respond that she is not in danger. Claire takes the stand, telling the audience that she was at home, and says that she had just turned 18 years old and that she was no longer a \u201cgirlfriend\u201d to the guards, only of an acquaintance. The show continues with Claire revealing that at home, both of the guards have had a history of sex crime or been convicted of these crimes. She begins by asking the guards to talk to her in a way that is clear to hear, and that allows her to understand that her presence will bring them to their knees. When they are unable to talk, Claire reveals that she has been sexually assaulted by another man, and is asking the guards for reassurance that it will be okay. When the guards are allowed to speak, Claire announces that she is not sexually assaulted by the other guards, in the same way that Claire was initially taken away to talk with the other guards. The show's main storyline takes place in the basement of the office in which she lives and works as a nurse for an unnamed woman. She is moved back to her cell after she has reached the age of 18, and she is not allowed back into her room or onto the other furniture except for for a brief moment during which she is forced to wear a bra and some clothes.\n\nClaire appears in Season 2 of \"The Fifth Element\" which premieres Friday night at 8 p.m. on the Showtime network.","token_len":560,"entropy":[9.2727,3.5318,7.0528,7.6565,3.6366,4.0857,2.5296,1.9621,3.4769,8.401,5.209,3.2363,11.7881,4.0757,1.9894,1.2028,2.9313,7.6241,0.857,2.9021,3.43,1.9739,4.7034,1.9615,3.2495,1.3452,1.4046,8.2048,0.323,5.128,11.3531,5.9758,1.9432,7.9657,3.4658,3.5372,2.2429,2.6663,0.9842,3.1944,0.0731,0.7686,1.6374,1.7601,1.1255,6.1318,2.9731,3.1077,5.5704,3.4227,0.5389,0.3756,3.6595,1.9581,2.2652,1.8307,2.7297,5.6205,2.8188,3.7454,5.3743,4.5031,2.0443,3.5843,2.5566,1.6624,1.8545,1.4373,6.3976,3.9489,2.986,2.2837,1.2716,0.0007,4.0825,0.001,7.1089,4.2513,16.3647,0.3657,0.1386,0.0964,0.0064,0.0093,0.0042,0.0006,0.0028,0.0025,0.0547,0.0044,0.007,0.0021,0.0024,0.0093,0.003,0.0005,0.0043,0.1402,0.0042,0.002,0.0001,0.0007,0.0022,0.0009,0.0003,0.0025,0.0016,0.0017,0.0017,0.0021,0.0015,0.0018,0.0003,0.0033,0.0011,0.0021,0.0011,0.0011,0.0329,0.0118,0.0009,0.0276,0.0057,0.0041,0.0072,0.0001,0.0006,0.0008,0.0094,0.0004,0.0007,0.0095,0.0024,0.0007,0.0006,0.0009,0.0388,0.0034,0.0013,0.0005,0.0036,0.0004,0.0021,0.0037,0.0026,0.0005,0.0218,0.0026,2.745,5.423,5.8162,1.1443,1.1832,3.6272,1.8303,3.6972,0.9774,4.7351,1.2656,7.0261,3.4434,0.4897,2.5732,4.5268,4.7692,1.6873,4.1535,0.718,6.5131,3.6636,0.6277,4.4194,0.1643,3.1377,1.1977,0.7878,4.1618,5.3831,4.47,0.1988,0.3055,4.4347,2.6331,0.0972,6.5048,0.4987,3.3891,1.8997,2.4457,5.1009,0.1793,6.5947,4.755,2.0544,0.9554,3.1371,1.7637,3.1479,0.0512,0.7427,2.4409,4.0289,0.9155,0.3474,0.6282,3.4542,1.9314,3.6199,3.6982,3.162,1.1534,3.2547,1.057,5.1127,3.3263,1.4308,0.5354,3.1606,7.0217,2.5097,1.6213,3.6359,0.2662,5.2868,4.2377,4.0578,1.4173,3.0481,6.2814,1.6455,1.2777,0.3939,2.2695,2.9699,3.3062,1.078,3.9692,0.9967,6.3431,2.3483,7.3704,4.4278,3.0712,5.9534,4.4361,0.2981,2.5922,1.4024,0.6686,2.8476,1.9517,4.0295,2.6256,0.6426,1.3461,2.6976,3.5751,0.4164,0.4863,4.918,4.6025,1.3264,1.6758,2.7634,1.7324,1.9367,3.1992,1.3428,1.0624,0.787,3.1971,1.881,5.2294,1.6076,1.8644,4.6986,1.6188,3.6159,2.1566,4.1176,0.5988,3.0377,0.4949,0.5736,3.3275,4.4358,3.4717,2.6428,1.4981,5.1836,0.6977,0.5306,3.1548,3.1994,5.2845,0.7455,3.0523,0.1221,1.8599,2.0219,0.4248,1.6612,5.7951,0.0706,2.6634,14.6059,5.8751,9.6976,1.8242,10.0152,3.2309,1.9686,1.6704,2.1793,5.638,6.1429,4.4006,3.1531,0.5468,1.891,3.5903,3.2756,1.5093,2.3643,7.5733,0.6121,6.2183,5.1596,0.8944,6.3872,0.9981,3.7033,0.9836,2.7468,3.4805,2.8033,3.8932,0.1241,4.5114,5.9327,4.2664,4.6144,3.075,0.1851,6.7361,0.2898,0.5024,2.1758,5.7301,1.3846,1.2519,1.2613,1.5561,1.9974,4.5015,0.5167,0.5033,4.5478,2.2865,3.1557,0.1858,2.101,5.0517,1.2617,5.944,1.4386,1.1521,2.6795,6.624,0.8139,0.1204,3.3958,1.8181,3.2779,5.3201,3.9885,4.3518,2.5086,1.9946,2.6336,3.0261,0.9285,3.4165,2.6074,2.562,4.6395,0.01,2.3666,0.7533,1.5665,4.7611,0.294,0.7742,1.6336,1.5572,3.2147,0.1397,1.1907,3.9914,1.7663,1.4393,0.9181,3.5983,4.0224,1.5339,0.3073,2.9125,7.1328,0.1144,0.7951,3.6286,1.8618,1.7658,1.5488,1.5196,2.4969,1.2231,0.3808,2.205,5.3783,0.0763,1.849,0.9493,1.2742,5.7437,0.1988,0.597,1.1953,2.3018,5.4139,0.1093,1.956,2.2695,1.9745,3.0933,0.6875,5.4834,2.5311,1.6602,0.3021,0.2525,4.9188,2.0182,5.1132,5.363,3.5176,3.7831,4.5533,3.3485,1.0581,1.4326,0.3361,0.4956,2.1181,1.64,5.0863,2.9338,2.9863,3.443,0.1351,1.2862,1.1435,3.9037,0.3077,1.0525,4.5974,3.217,1.4504,2.2852,2.8009,3.1008,4.726,2.8063,0.6494,4.1475,3.5983,3.8382,5.439,3.6896,0.993,2.2774,1.1269,6.5906,4.6871,0.7749,0.7494,4.0269,2.6531,2.0344,2.2724,7.1438,0.9341,2.0555,0.1344,0.9343,0.8588,0.9736,2.5894,1.1797,4.259,1.887,3.4389,1.5022,1.0321,1.1854,4.1019,4.8617,0.4703,4.1997,8.8086,4.8473,1.1899,7.0647,1.6937,3.7219,1.1606,3.1806,0.9845,0.2888,1.0824,4.1675,0.1562,3.8014,0.7922,3.3722,1.486,4.6462,2.1499,0.9077,1.576,0.0002,2.0241,0.001,4.4027,0.7647,3.2256,1.0444,2.1246,2.8836,1.5927,6.2809,1.5253,1.3639,4.9097,5.0552,0.0002,4.6613,4.3034,1.2351,1.1768,0.8167,0.0006,0.0003,0.0523,1.1589,3.2273,6.3599,0.8069,0.1895]}
{"id":1894,"ended":true,"length":531,"text":"In 2012 proponents gathered 372 @, @ 000 voter signatures through a citizens'initiative in Los Angeles County to put Measure B on the 2012 ballot. As a result, Measure B is one of the largest urban voter turnout efforts ever, with a record 908,500, including 1,531,900 registered voters.\nIt also puts L.A. County in an unprecedented \"green\" position \u2013 being the first city of the country to pass the controversial Measure B.\nCounty Supervisor David Yarmody, whose district includes the L.A. Department of Neighborhoods, said: \"Measure B was one of the first ballot initiatives that we put up. I am proud of the way it had been built. Los Angeles County had the largest share and was a great place for them to build those housing projects. Our goal is to move out of the current housing industry and we need to create a fair and livable environment for everyone in our community.\"\n\"It is too soon to know if Measure B will be implemented, but our focus is going to continue to create a local housing supply and we will continue to work with voters to push for a complete solution for our community housing needs. We will vote in November where you expect to find affordable, affordable housing for everyone in the county where you live. My heart is in the right place.\"\nWith the election still in less than 10 months away, it's critical for the county to increase investment in public housing as the economic engine driving the development of a strong and thriving economic economy continues to build for many of the poorest in California.\n\"It is important to make real progress toward the end of this campaign,\" said the Measure B initiative's director Kevin McCallum. \"At the same time, the economic engine is driving the construction of affordable, high-quality housing in this region of the state. We are focused on taking a strong position on what will build the best possible quality of life for our residents, and I am thrilled to see voters support us to build affordable affordable housing in this district.\"\n\"We need action today,\" said Supervisor Manny Diaz. \"While we're making plans to support Measure B, it is critical that we get the right funding package together during the campaign to get the job done.\"\nProposal 2 would create jobs in Los Angeles, and build up the region's supply of affordable housing. This measure will build thousands of jobs in the next 6 to 12 months, while providing a substantial amount of new residential and commercial space and amenities.\nMeasure B would also add 13 million new square feet of housing, which would provide jobs in Los Angeles County, Los Angeles County for the past two years, making the region the first city in the country to pass the controversial Measure B initiative.","token_len":561,"entropy":[7.7492,14.5724,7.8786,13.5805,12.1335,7.7093,3.3445,14.2185,10.2802,2.7511,6.8549,1.798,10.5605,0.8315,14.9226,0.3697,0.0866,3.5526,6.1493,0.0179,1.8589,2.5245,3.9501,7.0919,3.0687,0.3204,0.1104,6.8208,0.0558,0.2454,4.8389,2.3802,0.2678,0.4428,4.6904,0.2179,3.0682,5.0759,0.0842,0.7835,2.6229,6.3674,1.9372,3.5171,2.5136,2.973,2.9304,1.9005,2.9094,3.5179,5.0188,5.7771,0.1459,4.2191,4.5989,4.1459,2.7585,0.8831,4.583,2.6463,0.1405,4.8627,2.1373,0.1701,0.7095,0.8945,11.4832,3.1784,5.7016,7.16,0.0695,0.0036,0.1996,0.5189,1.437,4.1028,2.5959,5.4036,4.8162,2.1084,1.8392,4.53,5.9368,1.2548,2.1181,2.5261,5.1075,1.9974,2.7139,0.4309,2.9572,3.8184,4.96,3.4587,0.4806,1.4444,0.7705,6.1558,0.1339,1.9208,3.2172,4.4848,4.6325,8.6962,1.7344,3.3742,1.0874,0.3198,1.4223,2.9894,0.0255,0.0012,0.0688,6.8307,0.0041,4.4716,0.8139,0.416,1.3937,2.8141,0.3534,4.6797,0.0395,2.8746,3.4112,0.0283,0.2352,2.2947,4.1897,0.2992,1.5905,2.1984,3.0288,3.8095,2.1102,2.9574,2.9432,1.6437,0.8702,1.2043,3.4313,1.4086,5.3146,2.5959,5.1671,1.2483,6.8551,0.0022,0.7417,4.4501,2.8018,2.3093,3.6546,6.0714,3.8559,2.9625,3.3456,1.5306,1.3979,4.6778,0.3169,3.3835,6.1909,8.7451,0.9018,0.9735,4.3149,3.6634,1.0123,0.1942,4.5613,4.6384,0.493,1.0794,3.8483,2.8149,5.9473,0.9103,3.8886,3.4941,0.5642,4.2758,1.7676,6.278,1.2302,2.882,0.0003,2.6885,0.7653,2.696,2.082,1.6188,0.4271,0.697,0.1264,3.2684,2.3233,1.7444,6.102,1.4796,0.1068,2.8626,2.1337,1.7191,0.0222,0.2872,1.6478,3.6719,1.9485,0.1897,4.091,4.2974,0.6908,5.3999,0.1062,4.6412,0.2425,4.9092,2.1273,6.6308,2.7683,3.142,2.3073,3.3434,1.6923,1.2377,0.1372,1.697,0.5765,5.2981,0.9329,4.958,1.0762,1.9858,5.0916,3.3904,2.6265,2.1235,2.3457,7.0422,0.8297,2.1871,1.241,1.5895,6.2137,2.5357,1.0358,6.6401,6.016,5.6479,1.3268,3.5871,4.1752,1.9296,1.222,0.4852,1.9948,2.3079,1.1491,2.4379,1.7335,5.9984,3.227,0.0182,1.4994,5.5629,3.7451,2.2793,3.0502,0.6963,0.4193,0.004,2.1807,0.1835,5.0828,1.8808,3.2796,4.8146,2.3444,9.5658,0.0019,4.9611,2.0963,2.1488,0.1455,3.3044,1.4383,5.2235,1.7863,2.1308,3.0128,0.397,5.7752,6.0193,0.4416,3.5565,0.6042,3.6906,2.3693,5.4401,5.7585,4.0099,1.127,3.2423,0.3139,4.3664,5.0204,1.9941,2.9982,4.6608,2.7801,2.3156,0.1475,4.2076,4.986,3.6727,1.7579,1.0274,4.0252,2.778,3.9387,0.1724,0.7451,2.5878,2.7841,0.9302,2.1276,1.2452,3.7246,6.2835,0.7675,3.5501,2.457,3.2318,0.1494,1.1599,3.4864,1.981,0.6291,5.3944,6.7716,0.1268,4.2082,1.0595,4.2595,7.0902,5.9244,1.8909,0.9822,0.2944,0.1967,5.2968,0.674,0.8711,0.0015,0.165,2.7338,4.7063,2.2374,2.0818,2.9,1.42,3.6886,0.1532,2.222,1.793,3.0022,0.4572,0.2645,1.0287,1.9234,2.985,3.3191,3.753,1.3935,0.7268,0.586,1.6369,1.8449,4.8069,0.0666,6.308,3.0801,3.1401,2.9835,0.9823,4.3341,3.3289,4.7794,1.9393,2.786,2.9168,3.9134,1.4002,0.6468,0.3074,1.2473,0.9973,1.9123,1.1898,3.2484,1.6479,4.3812,1.0452,0.8404,4.973,3.1633,2.9151,3.3689,2.2566,2.6572,3.6705,0.2973,1.3902,1.5864,4.0548,0.6288,0.2216,2.0881,1.6283,2.9614,6.703,4.2358,2.0186,0.5364,2.2692,9.4261,2.2235,1.1967,0.0442,5.0278,1.3729,3.2953,5.0306,5.3925,1.1624,4.6921,2.5702,0.0318,0.5113,2.7672,0.985,2.8444,0.5983,0.6786,3.2898,2.0463,2.6438,3.4129,5.1918,5.2172,7.3408,0.6426,2.8664,1.2972,2.671,1.8508,5.5503,0.0353,1.6913,0.1787,5.6869,4.2885,3.7178,3.7653,2.9856,5.8263,1.4427,2.1047,0.0031,3.5174,2.9775,4.4648,4.0762,1.6295,4.1314,0.129,5.6728,0.1966,0.5687,0.3642,0.8364,3.7643,2.4402,2.7875,4.5588,5.7069,0.0502,2.0583,1.531,1.1225,4.6149,5.9919,1.9764,2.3782,0.2354,0.9331,3.2383,2.8982,2.74,4.7046,3.5021,0.0214,3.0208,5.8718,1.3619,0.2061,2.1835,3.3239,5.2878,1.3114,0.8069,2.6025,0.1931,1.3253,1.3069,4.3222,5.6341,3.6013,1.1116,3.0139,0.0232,0.1208,2.8762,2.4311,2.7196,0.7949,2.674,3.9106,1.8063,2.6666,0.0008,1.6735,1.5814,3.9365,0.0435,1.3032,6.0862,1.8259,3.6698,3.2221,0.8537,0.5489,7.3907,2.1595,1.1255,1.3059,2.9661,3.8527,0.3263,0.1643,0.7601,0.2416,3.526,2.0136,3.4781,2.1866,0.0709,3.065,0.1897]}

{"id":2631,"ended":false,"length":369,"text":"Athletes with disabilities did compete in the Olympic Games prior to the advent of the Paralympics. The first athlete to do so was German American gymnast George < unk > in 1904, who had competed at the Summer Olympics between 1914 and 1923, winning gold in three of those races, including a gold in the 4\u00d7400m final (3\u00d7100m hurdles, 100m freestyle and 200m deep freestyle).  During World War I, the American National League used a combination of American and German strength athletes to help out during the Japanese invasion and occupation.  At the 1944 Olympic Games, the US use of German was heavily criticized as \"racist,\" and only two years later, the Soviet Union was accused of being \"racist.\"  However, the United States and the USSR did try hard to change their culture as people of color became members of other ethnicities, as a result of the Nazi Holocaust.\n\nHistory\nThe sport was first played in the United States in 1891.\n\nIn 1895, in addition to US use, there were other US states who competed.  For example, in 1891, California, Utah and New York were allowed to use Germany's version of the same competition.  They were also allowed to use the Olympic Games as a basis for the Olympic Charter of 1906.\n\nHowever, in 1928, as part of the US national team, the country used British-born American James C. D.

{"id":797,"ended":true,"length":523,"text":"Erected as a permanent memorial to the men of Oldham who were killed in the First World War, Oldham's war memorial consists of a granite base surmounted by a bronze sculpture depicting five young women \u2013 one of whom was a pregnant female, who was a doctor who needed to be sedated \u2013 and an altar of Christ.\n\nIt also contains a plaque affixed to the centre of the sculpture, saying: \"...a memory of this great, beautiful man who died not long ago. And we leave to mourn those who have departed.\"\n\nThe sculpture was commissioned by the Victorian government, but because the sculptor was unable to furnish it due to funding problems, it is now only allowed to be left by the public.\n\nThe statue was installed in November and was intended to be a temporary memorial as to the people of Oldham who were at the centre of the First World War.\n\nOriginally a memorial to soldiers killed in the Second World War, the statue was eventually turned into an installation that is now in use as both a memorial and a memorial tribute to those men who died fighting for the nation during that time.\n\nThe statue is part of a broader initiative to recognise the legacy of the servicemen who died fighting and who later became part of Britain's history.\n\nThe statue was constructed in the heart of Oldham in 1920 and is now part of the council's main road system.\n\nIt features a statue of Oldham Chief Constable George Brown as being a \"sign of honour\" of the man who fought for England, but also an image of Lord Chief Constable Brown with the words: \"Don't forget that your life is in our hands\" (as opposed to \"we\").\n\nThe statue was also recently renamed as \"The Oldham Soldiers' Memorial\", after the poet Richard Loeffler, who made many friends with the women who served during the war, as well as the names of the children who were born into the service.\n\nThe statue of Lord Chief Constable Brown is part of a larger initiative to recognise the legacy of the servicemen who died fighting and who later became part of Britain's history.\n\nIn the same year, the statue of Harold Whitehead, an Airstroke pilot, was placed in the City of London as a memorial to his son and brother and to mark the anniversary of his death.\n\nIt came back to haunt the mayor of London and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who launched a public consultation on a statue to be made and unveiled after Labour leader Ed Miliband had won

{"id":1400,"ended":false,"length":513,"text":"Today Eppley Airfield sits on 2 @, @ 650 acres ( 10 @. @ 7 km2 ) and handles approximately 400 flights a week. There are two concourses that hold 20 gates, one at the edge of Eppley. The other is a three story main lobby, the other at the upper end of Eppley. This section of the building sits behind the main lobby and is accessed from any plane (except for those with the Airbus A320). Inside we see the Eppley Building. It\u2019s a gorgeous building, and I will be sure to take a look if I can.\n\nIt makes it one of my favorite buildings in Europe. I also like the fact that it sits on the corner of the existing Eppley Building and the Eppley building. There\u2019s a lot of beauty to it, there\u2019s tons of architectural detail, and it\u2019s a beautiful place to sit in, eating and relaxing. I have to go and see if I can find this one.\n\nI have been working on my next post I want you to follow that day, where we walk through my Eppley building and learn more about it. Then I will give you a tour and let you know if it was worth it.\n\nI just want to say, that was AMAZING! I mean... it was an awesome day, and I would definitely go back and do this again. It was wonderful to see the beautiful old buildings that once served as this building. I just can\u2019t do it right now, and maybe it will just happen the next time!!\n\nThis is my first time visiting the Eppley building, so I would definitely recommend it to others! It is beautiful, and the building itself is amazing. I have had some of my last travel adventures from London, but to this day I still am not as comfortable as I had been getting about my travels. I also love the fact that I could visit my dad\u2019s old house in Eppley, even though I am in England. I am so very much looking forward to it.\n\nOne of my favorite places to visit in Europe is France. It is an amazing country. Like many places, it is built for its people, and its tourism is great! Epele, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Les Sibilit\u00e9es, and the like all have interesting museums. I have visited many places in France and it was always a good idea especially if there is a museum for it. The Epele and the Rue du Monde in Paris have really amazing restaurants too! And here are some interesting food places which you definitely want to try when visiting France (or Spain)!","token_len":564,"entropy":[8.5283,6.7061,3.8947,8.7976,3.0846,8.2671,1.4173,5.7641,15.6162,8.0499,5.912,10.0369,3.7842,4.1021,9.2671,7.1811,5.3391,5.3876,4.0894,8.5883,4.7187,0.8717,2.0826,8.8763,3.9942,4.6042,3.4749,1.1384,2.684,0.6822,4.9204,0.6031,3.153,8.087,0.0697,3.8241,4.6857,5.5515,9.4918,1.9632,2.6218,2.8716,1.4808,6.1226,0.1309,4.584,0.0453,0.0011,4.0474,1.8515,2.5943,1.0184,2.4413,5.2508,3.044,4.8315,4.8258,2.6635,3.4257,3.1674,1.5072,0.6954,5.2669,2.3973,0.1361,2.2878,0.0082,0.0014,1.045,3.7215,5.6384,1.2893,0.5639,3.1232,5.3481,4.9268,1.0444,3.1356,2.7087,1.8071,1.5465,4.9931,1.6794,6.1446,6.0588,4.1538,2.5783,2.0104,3.2675,2.2462,3.4942,6.2665,0.2242,1.1989,1.4794,6.572,5.6491,4.3728,1.8571,4.1394,0.2172,0.001,5.2065,2.3791,2.9408,16.3279,8.0288,2.9843,1.7684,5.267,2.0506,2.0363,2.8382,3.4207,3.8539,2.1729,4.287,0.0169,3.8327,1.4735,0.9241,3.6414,1.0219,1.8464,1.3368,1.7343,0.257,4.5694,5.7448,3.5448,4.8297,0.0587,1.9591,0.3715,2.25,0.333,5.3375,0.8212,2.3515,4.4702,1.924,0.7863,1.2906,0.1141,0.8785,3.7466,1.0844,1.3831,4.9504,0.1319,1.8758,6.3774,2.5973,0.056,0.0011,3.1305,0.7556,1.1397,3.4223,0.1678,0.001,6.7515,2.5265,3.4043,4.1906,0.2618,0.1029,1.132,2.3948,0.2573,6.8654,1.9757,1.7568,1.2643,6.0324,0.7677,0.02,0.0383,4.826,0.0316,5.7228,1.3984,1.1717,0.5374,1.4092,0.7911,0.0123,0.0097,2.0181,2.1719,1.5209,0.4403,2.9973,2.6077,2.9965,7.4915,2.2927,2.0568,0.5815,2.5425,3.0935,2.5403,4.9652,3.3318,1.942,5.1341,0.6324,0.2165,1.8606,3.9179,2.7013,0.9674,0.6943,0.0002,2.7809,2.6021,2.0518,5.1521,0.9946,2.6083,3.5828,4.7893,7.2881,2.4893,4.1999,0.0756,4.3203,6.0307,6.2025,2.7504,5.2404,3.3052,5.5505,1.3487,3.9014,5.2217,0.0192,0.002,3.4866,1.6888,4.3028,1.5833,0.0839,1.3982,0.3194,5.3534,1.063,0.7913,3.7041,0.1219,0.9375,2.4069,3.0298,3.6363,0.0287,0.9543,1.5815,2.7234,3.9756,1.1573,1.4567,0.6834,0.8241,0.0002,3.2916,5.427,1.4275,0.142,1.409,3.058,2.7126,4.7341,7.8268,0.0043,0.0049,1.3699,1.6455,4.317,6.1193,3.0058,1.118,3.8177,2.2913,1.7067,2.201,1.1369,0.8391,3.3455,2.3815,3.0297,0.2065,1.6114,3.0968,3.4073,0.4905,0.8815,3.1794,1.2836,5.6665,0.4647,1.2046,1.6348,3.6832,5.5671,2.4163,1.8155,4.1611,4.0282,0.692,5.7125,4.5123,0.9978,1.5826,4.1327,3.3741,6.0609,0.404,0.0088,5.2623,1.0666,5.3821,0.626,2.1054,1.7352,5.0206,2.5242,1.2157,3.5741,4.4337,5.5128,0.4176,0.2721,7.0691,0.7216,0.0003,4.4929,1.6887,1.7392,1.8927,2.2796,2.6609,1.6904,1.0379,0.0057,0.0014,1.763,1.1886,1.5861,0.9043,3.4415,4.2529,0.5986,1.4766,0.759,3.2732,2.6118,2.7447,0.914,3.8188,0.8442,1.1826,2.5849,3.1983,2.4874,0.439,3.1966,0.5131,1.5513,2.631,3.4998,2.777,4.0078,1.5389,6.2012,6.8461,6.6091,4.929,5.144,0.9311,2.1954,4.7227,4.0631,0.2452,0.6206,2.8983,4.0272,1.754,4.584,4.7549,2.2613,0.1944,4.0974,1.9516,6.5385,6.0009,3.7724,2.9082,1.3146,1.5129,4.0834,3.1663,0.8634,1.3124,0.0281,1.8407,3.2176,4.4372,3.4404,5.1278,4.8149,0.1844,0.2109,3.0582,1.5992,1.8876,3.0354,0.0222,0.0012,1.5661,4.587,0.949,1.0623,3.0236,3.0549,3.5661,1.0307,1.5641,2.9381,2.516,4.2906,4.3187,0.363,0.0022,0.0092,3.0946,1.4593,0.7787,0.0002,5.6848,1.4652,1.2729,0.8005,2.9822,0.4339,1.1651,2.8202,0.8722,0.4367,5.0945,0.5922,1.8963,0.5787,3.3206,1.0643,2.2724,2.4071,5.8017,2.3671,2.2494,1.6805,0.8349,0.9396,4.9127,3.4437,4.6199,1.2404,0.9863,0.9256,3.1672,6.2616,1.2748,3.4043,2.9031,5.9641,7.952,3.0461,4.0148,6.3704,1.1064,0.0239,0.178,15.135,1.3564,8.0891,3.0025,0.1465,0.481,4.9914,4.2586,6.2621,5.8711,1.7401,0.7308,0.7567,2.8333,2.8532,4.9218,1.5587,0.9761,5.8864,3.2344,2.3343,2.0105,2.2381,1.7681,2.1639,2.9627,1.2537,0.7255,2.1688,2.5048,2.3265,3.6894,2.1857,3.7149,1.4992,9.7034,2.9991,3.6111,1.5304,0.6251,1.5009,4.1543,5.0125,0.5052,2.5938,2.7829,0.2857,0.0173,4.2268,2.4129,5.6211,2.8789,4.0954,0.3207,3.8433,0.4335,2.5636,4.3443,3.865,5.7338,6.1175,1.7146,4.1594,5.2525,2.4282,0.4769,4.4866,5.4495,1.7709,5.9097,2.665,5.9779,1.5283,0.033,2.8079,4.8042,1.6244,0.5923,4.8914,3.9194,4.9269,3.4123]}

{"id":2200,"ended":true,"length":517,"text":"Opposition to Chicago's skyscrapers began to grow during the late 1880s and early 1890s. Even before the development of the skyscraper, some criticized large buildings in Chicago for dominating churches and private offices.\n\n\"As soon as I started organizing in the mid 1890s, we saw the rise of the skyscraper, especially the two towers above their main buildings,\" said Frank Leitz, president of the Chicago Public Schools (PPSS).\n\n\"It started with the two towers. And then the other towers were built, and people started asking where [the steel] will go.\"\n\nOne of the tallest buildings was Mount Carmel, which houses the Cathedral of St. Matthew. St. Mary's Catholic Church built above the other tower, where it has a choir and a school building. The Catholic Church is located in front of the building at the west end of the school, which houses PPSS elementary and middle schools.\n\n\"We had to rebuild the churches on top of them because we had to have the churches built on top of the buildings,\" Leitz said. \"People were talking about that building before the buildings were built because it was so tall and tall.\"\n\nAs time went by, the popularity and popularity of the towers, as well as the rise of the new design, spurred the city to do something about them.\n\nIn addition to the churches, the city began to erect a new city church at St. Mary's in the middle of a neighborhood that was mostly known as \u201cLittle Little Red\u201d when it was first added to the US map in the 1950s.\n\nSince that time, the church has served the Catholic community.\n\n\"At one point, we used to have the church in the middle of the neighborhood where the school was built, but it was too big and it was so small when we started the building,\" Leitz said.\n\n\"The church was not built like it should have been around that area... The city started to see the growth.\"\n\nThat growth, Leitz said, allowed the city to start to do more with its historical buildings.\n\nOne of those historic buildings is one of four towers above the main buildings at the entrance to the church, where the building was built.\n\n\"We got new architecture,\" he said.\n\nThere was an addition of a gymnasium. The city also took over the church from the city, Leitz said.\n\nA new building is expected to be completed after the first of the week of January in Chicago. The new building will be home to a community center, a theater, a bakery and a bookstore.\n\n\"We plan to use the new church that's already there,\" Leitz said.","token_len":565,"entropy":[8.348,2.2794,10.6533,0.8276,9.3432,1.4181,0.0032,5.718,2.4156,2.181,4.0055,0.3625,3.4408,5.9308,0.0556,1.5277,0.73,0.0172,0.0004,0.8743,6.1357,2.0034,0.8609,4.3438,0.3549,1.0408,4.4656,0.5661,1.0998,3.6997,7.7292,8.0972,2.8755,2.587,1.4258,0.7366,7.995,10.5879,0.8987,5.4491,4.9913,0.514,1.4559,0.0005,3.3928,4.8053,2.9911,0.0075,2.8301,2.6183,6.5646,3.5732,1.4423,3.8841,4.095,0.0284,0.4928,3.3123,2.5937,1.978,3.3264,0.102,1.2333,2.9685,0.3332,2.4225,3.6929,1.9762,5.6504,1.75,3.2068,7.6237,4.5054,2.7392,0.5305,1.1029,4.8187,5.9652,5.123,0.851,2.6733,0.0847,0.3628,1.2664,3.4832,1.5588,5.6807,5.4921,0.0488,7.697,0.58,1.3269,0.0002,2.1335,2.4786,4.3103,1.7521,0.8415,5.4211,0.5621,2.6827,3.1784,1.748,1.8251,2.888,1.957,2.4367,1.3619,2.7817,1.2677,4.9961,1.0661,3.8964,4.4241,6.3875,0.6097,8.195,1.0856,5.6759,1.01,1.6557,0.0531,0.0002,4.5612,0.8725,0.3264,2.9891,0.8604,2.9574,7.9683,4.0082,0.0003,0.9975,1.4974,6.1895,0.4481,6.3009,0.3617,1.1762,0.0341,4.5855,1.2811,5.5476,0.0852,4.9752,0.7622,4.7285,0.7647,3.4384,8.5125,1.1677,5.398,1.0303,1.848,5.3563,1.9156,3.3002,2.6267,5.902,1.296,1.6527,4.6488,4.0995,0.7522,2.0148,4.7687,0.8089,2.812,2.5898,1.3673,5.6814,0.026,0.6366,2.7604,3.9664,1.9934,4.2805,0.3672,0.2409,0.7043,4.9373,1.8808,2.1981,2.9964,6.7772,0.2208,0.0107,5.2584,2.0107,0.5946,0.2997,0.2235,0.4275,0.0002,2.1027,2.1802,2.3908,1.6061,4.8629,1.2199,4.7267,4.1037,2.2649,0.213,3.1822,2.7847,2.4637,1.4359,0.5835,2.9237,2.0065,3.6669,3.565,1.4986,0.3094,0.0901,1.2317,1.5784,0.723,1.4079,0.0002,0.1087,0.0554,0.9416,4.476,1.5147,4.2312,0.1302,3.9516,1.9642,5.4093,2.1017,3.4259,1.3595,0.3818,4.4571,1.2815,0.5333,2.3261,2.7759,2.3147,4.3908,1.7844,0.0239,0.0001,4.2465,5.1447,0.7023,1.6386,0.1495,1.0984,6.6421,4.4922,1.8401,0.0342,0.6076,3.1158,4.4002,3.4468,0.1154,0.0199,0.5487,4.1146,0.2731,0.9357,3.9604,7.3898,0.7745,4.8391,2.0244,3.5036,0.5845,4.9122,1.4173,0.3542,2.5689,0.1986,0.6219,0.0001,2.4199,4.2759,0.093,1.558,4.1831,0.5913,1.0328,2.7445,2.4486,1.6925,5.0912,1.8562,1.6515,5.5067,6.5045,2.5223,4.1915,0.0218,1.5368,0.0725,2.692,2.1571,3.0971,0.0197,3.6486,3.5768,1.5728,1.4142,4.8889,5.2327,1.3029,14.6059,6.2457,5.7885,6.5613,5.3813,13.1565,7.8547,5.7472,1.1502,0.618,2.3585,6.4422,0.5598,0.3533,6.6363,1.6063,0.446,3.6023,3.0346,0.0154,0.1099,0.7592,0.0003,4.8768,3.2149,0.2086,0.0686,0.7383,2.6375,0.3777,3.2476,3.692,5.2381,1.2346,3.1742,1.232,0.0002,0.9519,5.1482,2.5882,0.6315,0.884,1.5827,3.5793,0.064,1.3543,2.9295,2.2857,1.9653,0.7658,1.9311,0.0869,0.6093,3.1447,2.7075,1.5823,3.6672,0.7791,2.0047,1.6356,1.5309,1.5576,0.8704,4.0756,1.3446,1.5426,2.231,0.7117,3.2022,2.9659,5.2593,1.1055,2.047,2.8286,1.4375,0.5559,0.9785,0.0003,0.0444,0.0285,0.7435,0.0002,1.8949,2.4053,1.5386,1.0391,4.0981,1.9827,4.1967,1.9862,2.9474,0.8568,0.0223,7.2308,3.1421,5.1775,7.0359,3.4429,4.191,3.797,0.7711,4.6856,1.4434,3.31,3.2695,0.0784,0.0002,4.9278,1.6846,2.4556,1.8787,0.0005,0.3093,0.0239,5.6442,0.5924,0.588,0.0707,4.0488,1.4886,4.4475,2.3484,1.2172,1.9798,6.3708,2.5056,0.5988,0.2259,0.0002,5.0843,0.5606,1.8275,3.5549,0.1694,1.2051,4.9496,0.6317,4.8618,4.3272,3.5229,0.747,3.0539,2.063,1.7447,1.465,6.1271,0.3946,0.7393,4.7918,1.9338,3.1912,1.254,3.1307,1.8575,0.5907,0.9146,0.9124,0.0002,0.9319,1.8757,4.714,5.972,4.9733,3.4576,2.3389,0.0518,0.1426,1.491,0.0002,4.7073,2.5142,3.2766,5.9775,2.1405,1.529,6.1417,0.403,0.0012,3.8963,1.9674,3.176,1.4872,4.8954,1.6272,0.6511,4.0355,2.5059,0.6967,3.2392,2.7761,2.8806,0.0009,0.0613,0.26,0.2399,0.0002,4.3387,2.2029,2.669,2.1609,4.4775,0.371,0.5253,1.0989,6.098,0.5818,3.268,2.3943,0.4046,9.0106,1.2906,3.2325,3.2255,4.2028,1.1184,2.1407,2.3016,0.5829,0.7676,0.8995,5.9197,0.0119,1.6796,4.6288,0.9432,1.261,1.6779,4.9714,0.7227,0.9889,6.5204,0.8858,0.7175,5.0475,0.3201,0.3659,0.0003,1.8708,1.3967,4.4313,0.3853,3.9384,1.0073,2.0192,3.1992,5.6205,2.4538,3.3739,1.0293,1.9743,0.3236,0.0007,0.0223,0.0835]}

It flows from the Pahang river, the Pahang, to the southern border of South East Asia (except Hong Kong) from Thailand. It rises to an altitude of 1,400 m (4,966\u00a0ft ). It forms the southernmost state of Hanoi, and the southernmost port city of Langkang and Ho Chi Minh and the northernmost province of Hanoi. The Indian border is also connected by Hong Kong to the north, but it is the easternmost part of India. It was established in 1754. The boundary between India and China is the Kargil border and its current name is Siam-Kargil. The largest land border in India is the western bank of the river Pahang and its terminus is Kargil. The southern boundary, in addition to reaching Siam, falls into the river Pahang with a distance of 3,200\u00a0km.\n\nMain attractions\nHanoi City is one of the largest cities in Vietnam\nThe Chuan District (Tao Tiang District, Thanh Quang District, Tuan Tha District, Hanoi, Vietnam); it contains a city named Chuan Town, which is known as Chuan Village, which is known as \u201cLittle Buddha\u201d, but also called \u201cLittle Buddha\u201d.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first and largest-known river (the Siam River), the Kargil\u2013Kargil Border by the Khongguoi\u2013Thanh River (also known as \u201cMonguoi River\u201d), was established to connect the Siam\u2013Kargil boundary to the Khenghu River and the north to the Siam\u2013Khuyu River.

{"id":491,"ended":true,"length":521,"text":"While in Congress, Berkley Bedell was Chairman of the Small Business Subcommittee, and he used this position to investigate underselling on the part of large oil companies. He also claimed that certain oil companies were on the hook for payments of $1B a year to BP and Shell, and said that the company, while being a small player, had violated its debt, and was in violation of the U.S. Consumer & Commercial Debt (USCDC) regulations. The USCDC requires oil companies to pay royalties on their gas profits to the United States.\n\nThe FTC has received millions of complaints, along with multiple investigations. Today, the FTC has received two probes from the Department of Justice. One probes into the use of a campaign funds system in favor of the Obama campaign to promote its political agenda to help Obama win the 2008 election in his home states, and a related investigation into whether the Obama campaign used campaign funds to influence the final legislative elections in his home states.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission will issue new consumer complaints to U.S. food manufacturers. The FTC has also investigated the use of technology by companies to deceive consumers. The FTC, however, has only begun to look into whether this technology violated the anti-money laundering law, which prohibits corporations from using money made for improper purposes.\n\nAnother probe into possible consumer fraud is the Consumer Fraud Enforcement Group. The Consumer Fraud Enforcement Group is chaired by President Obama, and consists of hundreds of attorneys specialized in the complaint-tracking industry. According to the FTC\u2019s website, \u201cThe Commission\u2019s consumer fraud task force focuses on the enforcement and surveillance of money-laundering (IMM) enforcement.\u201d The agency also investigates financial institutions for fraud. The FTC will submit the first major complaint against any of the entities in the Citizens Bank Group, and the following steps will be taken by the SEC under a whistleblower notice.\n\nFailing to pay taxes. A criminal charge against a U.S. employee who has mismanaged taxes may result in a penalty up to eight months in prison, and prison time up to 18 months. The penalties range from up to $2,000, and one to four years in prison.\n\nProfit from financial misconduct. An employee may be fined or suspended from business for up to nine months, and up to four years in prison.

{"id":2597,"ended":false,"length":532,"text":"In 1907, Spokane's board of park commissioners retained the services of the Olmsted Brothers to draw up a plan for Spokane's parks. Much of Spokane's park land was acquired by the city of Spokane in 1902. The Olmsted Brothers' work was focused on the urban areas around Spokane's city, while the company of the brothers' work was focused on the urban areas around Spokane's city. A lot of the old city of Spokane, mostly on the east side of the city, was eventually redeveloped into a lot of private property.\n\nAfter a year of negotiations with the city, and planning along with the city and its park district, the commission agreed to use only private property rights if it had to deal with the Olmsted Brothers in certain circumstances. Once the Olmsted Brothers passed their will, they agreed to create a public park on the public land off of the site of the former \"Omsted Brothers\" plant in Spokane.\n\n\"During the meeting, and after considerable discussion in the years since, the Oumsted Brothers chose not to use any of their public land to establish a park with a public park,\" Mayor Bob Henning said of the agreement. \"This decision was based on the opinion of the citizens of Spokane and the views and opinions of the Olmsted Brothers, and was taken in good faith.\"\n\n\"It was their decision,\" Henning added.\n\n\"For all their accomplishments, nothing could have prepared them for this decision.\"\n\nCity hall and other organizations working to build parks throughout Spokane also voiced opposition to the use of private property rights on public land that could potentially interfere with the city's parks plan.\n\n\"Public lands in Spokane are sacred and the lands of others are sacred. As a city, this area needs to be protected and protected properly,\" President of the Spokane Public Lands Commission, John Revere, said.\n\n\"This can't be allowed to happen, 'Because of the city's planning and zoning policy, the public lands should now be owned and designated.\"\n\nRevere added that the city needs to consider whether its plans could be enforced.\n\n\"The parks authority must be consulted as soon as possible before it starts working on its plans for public lands.\"\n\nThe city would like to establish an annual budget for parks, which the public lands commission is currently working on.\n\n\"This would include parks and open space management, including those on vacant lots and protected lots,\" Council Member Bruce Tisdale said. \"The city should consider the public resources that can be generated to pay for these parks.\"\n\n\"There need to be a process and a framework. In the long run, parks and open space management would save the city a lot of money...and the public would benefit.\"","token_len":568,"entropy":[12.2854,0.3008,11.1005,2.6088,6.9239,0.2775,10.7185,1.2026,8.7946,1.3457,5.5508,0.0247,1.3612,8.4207,0.8666,0.0938,4.856,1.7246,5.829,0.8946,0.9015,1.3051,0.587,5.4506,0.326,2.9795,0.7906,7.5787,0.3787,5.1123,0.0866,2.7663,3.666,0.7894,4.0792,0.9695,0.4938,2.7546,2.2952,0.2389,1.309,4.6353,1.0539,1.4576,1.2232,0.0133,0.0061,0.3613,3.9811,5.4436,1.7811,6.1481,0.1939,2.1147,5.3901,2.8224,3.5439,1.481,1.511,4.1319,5.1516,4.2389,0.6706,5.1299,3.763,1.4477,3.6909,3.1826,6.0224,1.0187,1.6172,0.095,0.58,3.2115,0.5717,0.8241,0.7829,0.9167,1.9653,0.2533,4.7474,4.6115,0.095,0.937,5.9637,2.4544,3.1221,0.0381,4.1681,5.8333,3.7477,0.7465,2.1799,0.2487,0.2279,0.8025,1.1892,0.1943,0.4418,5.3307,3.4625,0.0007,0.743,0.8828,6.2789,0.3359,5.2561,2.933,0.9525,1.5874,0.0448,4.2715,3.0672,4.3663,0.9356,3.0635,1.8375,0.3165,0.6894,0.7635,4.2096,5.1361,7.2108,2.7927,0.7362,1.9046,3.044,3.7055,3.6016,3.7604,0.534,0.4314,6.405,2.6686,0.1737,4.7957,5.3702,4.4669,1.9435,6.7584,6.5181,1.8797,3.2772,2.5675,5.8552,0.0602,1.4703,3.6908,0.0089,0.0047,0.2624,3.7439,5.4263,3.1809,0.2386,5.7562,0.854,1.1809,0.0053,0.0041,0.1572,6.3763,2.7442,6.9721,0.6242,1.6337,4.8823,0.1342,5.1629,0.5418,3.4417,0.5398,2.403,0.8935,5.6192,1.7174,6.6054,1.3777,1.0647,5.6764,0.365,0.5492,2.8618,6.0372,4.9497,2.746,8.1267,2.4295,1.4404,5.5973,2.8481,2.0769,0.6423,1.4095,0.0002,4.3882,5.6896,0.6706,4.8782,0.8028,5.4253,2.0012,5.8308,1.0998,4.2164,0.7209,5.4686,1.9587,0.4577,1.0615,6.4531,7.1113,0.1691,0.1823,6.0447,2.475,0.01,2.9829,1.7344,1.2166,0.7902,2.95,1.3587,2.3229,5.5158,0.8436,1.3065,4.8666,2.1135,1.687,1.3829,2.3169,8.3449,5.3032,8.872,2.4666,1.3661,4.6835,0.2486,3.4011,0.5279,0.6477,2.5377,1.9979,0.8681,2.243,0.5139,0.8407,4.7487,0.3724,0.7323,4.8126,0.435,0.1284,1.7297,1.0671,5.3094,3.0044,2.675,0.1191,0.6357,3.394,0.0059,0.0032,0.0954,1.8104,1.0236,2.0393,3.6588,2.0378,2.2379,0.0465,1.1462,0.1276,0.0002,3.0822,2.5517,1.0826,5.8914,1.2844,2.1283,1.5861,0.0004,1.6715,0.4502,1.5226,0.0001,3.3013,5.2898,3.7178,3.4977,5.7002,0.9668,5.6918,2.1896,1.0605,0.9606,1.2237,0.5467,2.038,2.4155,3.1253,0.168,0.0001,5.016,6.8103,3.2077,3.2615,5.2434,4.7775,1.3232,3.7646,1.8615,4.0071,1.1898,4.2245,4.9053,2.8966,0.2004,0.224,4.5213,0.0344,0.7976,0.7717,0.7492,3.4731,1.1821,0.7726,4.913,3.3091,3.6152,5.1969,0.0159,0.9241,2.7376,0.0459,2.7262,3.0049,0.1326,0.4262,0.0001,0.8168,5.1398,1.4319,3.0285,0.6939,0.7954,3.9747,1.6471,3.0323,6.022,1.8064,5.1926,0.8082,2.1685,2.4289,4.0773,1.526,1.6517,0.6286,4.5341,6.059,3.4272,0.3704,0.1266,1.0322,1.69,1.1989,6.2997,0.7451,6.3976,2.8834,0.3777,0.4061,4.0389,1.2759,2.0254,2.3918,3.6225,6.4336,5.3495,0.2988,0.3973,1.5685,1.0591,0.0001,1.3401,2.4873,6.1512,1.1022,0.605,2.3222,0.207,0.5783,3.0073,7.5809,7.0985,2.8351,1.5499,4.193,0.8206,5.8983,2.0302,2.2377,3.3081,0.8759,2.1235,3.1093,0.6957,4.7611,7.5042,0.2402,2.8965,2.2654,7.3491,5.9206,0.0991,0.0001,3.2528,0.0348,2.1171,0.5171,1.1741,1.7119,3.8112,0.1612,3.8374,2.8869,4.2392,2.8435,2.8467,1.3458,4.8322,2.0375,0.2483,0.0002,0.3957,2.0617,5.5072,5.2556,3.2254,2.3038,3.8953,3.7944,3.8975,0.0052,0.1186,2.1332,1.8108,5.0366,5.2929,0.6205,2.0917,1.6298,1.836,3.0063,0.7001,3.1262,0.1529,0.0002,1.8363,2.3784,5.2688,2.4619,0.1315,6.8671,2.7459,3.6089,4.0324,0.8686,2.7517,2.2239,1.7424,2.8012,4.8822,3.1557,0.3311,2.6922,2.5484,2.1485,0.3775,0.3638,0.9137,0.0002,1.2835,2.7686,3.4596,3.6132,6.2552,2.4173,4.9769,0.266,4.9927,1.4602,3.6826,4.4636,2.8746,5.5166,1.5607,1.5158,6.466,3.4897,0.9081,4.4505,2.7862,5.812,5.3037,4.3118,0.0461,0.3595,0.185,0.8139,2.035,2.1095,2.714,2.4761,2.0004,3.5088,6.2575,2.1456,3.6634,0.1127,5.0116,3.6717,4.2703,0.1039,1.3307,1.8924,1.3693,0.1968,0.0001,2.7185,3.6253,5.7704,0.1207,0.0083,1.5736,4.0206,3.7326,1.262,5.5028,4.9004,4.3897,1.8095,2.8777,0.7649,0.1396,4.4018,2.2679,0.5507,0.1881,0.5996,3.3008,4.4682,1.6144,0.2754,3.659,0.2639,0.0241,0.0959,8.2244,3.0173,2.8441,2.0954,2.0742,3.1926,1.7261]}
{"id":4448,"ended":false,"length":539,"text":"The English version of Metal Gear Solid, translated by Jeremy Blaustein, who localized the Sega CD version of Snatcher, contains minor refinements made during localization, such as a choice of three different weapons \u2013 the sword, axe, and spear, respectively \u2013 that can be placed on the action screen at the same time, while a small number of cut-scenes appear, with specific scenes that are not shown. A lot of the minor changes of the Japanese version (i.e. the different weapon and Axe weapons) are incorporated into the English version, and make sense for how the game is translated into the US.\n\nIt makes sense that both versions would play like two games. One version of the game features the same weapons but the other one features the opposite weapons and the axe. The only difference is that those weapons are different for each one in the game and are similar to the Sword weapon. The second version of the game comes with the Sword weapon, which is similar to the axe weapon (but is not in the same system as the sword ) and requires all 3 weapons to be played at the same time to activate it. The only difference is that the weapon has a larger diameter compared to the axe and it also charges faster than the sword\u2019s larger diameter.\n\nBoth versions have some minor minor adjustments, such as the option to use the same attack as the main one, although the change is noticeable because it prevents the game from charging faster than the main one. To this end, the Japanese version of Snatcher has a slightly different combat style, only with the sword in turn. Since the Japanese version uses the same attack and therefore the sword, Japanese players can use the same attack. The English version of Snatcher has a sword action, and the English version uses a normal sword.\n\nThere are also minor minor additions to the English version of the game. For example, a new camera system in the English version can be used. When the player taps the screen, they can see \u201cSlide to choose which direction you will go\u201d. When they tap the screen again, they can choose their path.

In 1994, as on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Lebanese government (2003), an inscription of 'Resilience and Resistance' was written on the area.","token_len":570,"entropy":[1.9437,10.3052,3.6148,0.0495,4.1923,1.1,4.332,0.9539,0.4508,6.6037,0.0442,3.9434,12.6433,2.3556,3.3602,0.3756,1.656,12.4625,5.6521,0.9298,7.8771,1.7178,3.2707,7.6442,0.2316,12.0061,6.0007,6.6147,9.5124,2.6364,0.6173,6.3868,2.0925,8.3534,1.2047,1.1675,3.701,0.8787,1.6429,5.468,0.8519,1.744,2.6693,1.1755,4.2437,4.8111,0.1204,0.7744,2.6562,4.2129,0.0298,4.6535,7.8559,1.5095,6.8741,2.0343,0.4815,4.1644,0.5036,2.0584,4.6827,4.1677,3.9501,4.9106,1.3281,2.2219,1.0244,1.442,1.8067,2.8198,3.5108,5.3236,0.8921,2.4726,3.6457,2.0508,2.3049,3.0614,0.892,3.2329,0.0182,0.3568,3.5751,0.2275,4.0316,1.5473,2.7733,1.8033,5.8218,0.4092,0.6587,1.6277,5.9351,2.9779,4.9838,5.8125,1.9544,0.3169,6.551,1.9275,1.9245,3.2084,5.8774,1.5822,1.0681,2.5409,0.2203,5.3255,3.5092,0.1858,4.2661,3.304,0.903,3.4241,0.8209,3.1547,0.004,2.404,1.7985,1.8114,1.202,0.8697,2.5964,0.0135,4.5008,5.7259,4.935,0.8046,4.383,3.1809,3.3947,0.1177,0.6935,0.1362,1.0657,1.7713,7.0468,0.1351,0.6762,2.5475,4.4349,4.9314,1.0262,4.3113,1.2248,5.7693,1.3307,1.9333,0.1476,2.9734,1.9372,0.2637,4.3489,2.7971,5.3026,0.1693,5.2714,7.5184,2.3428,5.8956,0.0718,0.4273,5.7289,0.0161,0.0827,0.011,0.2372,2.8165,0.0292,0.2764,5.276,3.2097,4.1601,4.9819,0.6055,4.2073,5.2357,3.5593,5.2895,5.2991,6.046,0.5391,2.7378,5.1114,1.2251,0.3602,3.6298,0.8281,0.1678,5.4852,1.6255,1.771,0.0137,4.2612,0.27,2.9106,1.1607,0.0036,0.8259,0.2397,0.0445,0.0065,0.0118,0.0127,0.0018,0.0584,1.8182,0.0185,0.0045,0.055,0.0576,0.0565,0.0024,0.0032,0.004,0.0075,0.0155,11.8211,0.5226,0.6452,2.3352,0.0038,0.7948,0.0811,0.2852,0.2078,0.392,0.0451,0.4362,0.0217,0.0035,0.004,0.0043,0.0376,0.0159,0.015,0.0228,0.0912,0.3001,0.5834,0.0727,5.6372,0.1916,0.0195,0.0159,0.0471,1.1353,0.0012,1.2083,0.0368,0.0061,0.0094,0.0004,0.0039,0.0016,0.0154,0.0013,0.0008,0.0054,0.0097,0.0353,0.0004,0.002,0.0077,0.1346,0.0026,0.0047,0.0024,0.0005,0.0005,0.001,0.0144,0.0007,0.0026,0.0074,0.0026,0.0012,0.0086,0.0015,0.0013,0.09,0.0132,0.0098,0.0068,0.0026,0.0025,0.0013,0.0025,0.0017,0.0015,0.002,0.0245,0.0003,0.0018,0.0099,0.0005,0.0004,0.0029,0.0014,0.002,0.0016,0.0021,0.0306,0.0249,0.0011,0.0007,0.0181,0.0018,0.0013,0.001,0.04,0.0012,0.0007,0.027,0.004,0.0002,0.0016,0.1825,0.0149,0.0111,0.0007,0.018,0.0008,0.0026,0.0164,0.011,0.0005,0.0006,0.0009,0.0058,0.0016,0.0026,0.0006,0.0013,0.0021,0.0002,0.0002,0.0006,0.0009,0.0006,0.0004,0.0017,0.0999,0.0076,0.0008,0.0013,0.0024,0.0013,0.006,0.0011,0.0024,0.0102,0.0027,0.0009,0.0007,0.002,0.002,0.0007,0.0012,0.0388,0.0042,0.0016,0.0212,0.0033,0.0086,0.0028,0.0008,0.0077,0.0009,0.0027,0.0,0.001,0.0007,0.0026,0.0056,0.0046,0.0013,0.0017,0.0014,0.0007,3.1184,0.0002,3.5698,0.0712,0.5293,0.0238,0.0015,0.004,0.0033,0.0265,0.0037,0.0008,0.0016,0.0017,0.0043,0.8773,3.6569,0.0118,0.0312,0.0453,0.0156,0.0025,0.0026,0.0914,0.0038,0.0078,0.0077,0.0009,0.0018,0.0051,0.0239,0.006,0.0014,0.0011,0.0111,0.0203,0.0057,0.0014,0.0022,0.0003,0.0012,0.0016,0.023,0.0736,0.004,7.589,0.1078,0.3219,0.3501,0.1057,0.1209,0.1605,0.0341,0.0127,0.0401,0.1244,0.0012,0.1617,0.1059,0.0075,0.0117,0.0011,0.0036,0.0044,0.0093,0.0017,0.0009,0.0075,0.0054,0.027,0.0004,0.002,0.0066,0.0042,0.0021,0.0022,0.0016,0.0005,0.0007,0.0012,0.0108,0.0006,0.0011,0.0047,0.0034,0.0033,0.0119,0.0007,0.0018,0.0553,0.0385,0.0171,0.0093,0.0024,0.0023,0.0024,0.0089,0.0039,0.0053,0.0034,0.0125,0.0005,0.0018,0.0037,0.0006,0.0009,0.0013,0.0011,0.0013,0.0012,0.0035,0.0147,0.0126,0.0014,0.0006,0.0151,0.0016,0.0008,0.0009,0.0164,0.0014,0.0005,0.0308,0.0008,0.0002,0.0013,0.1732,0.0388,0.023,0.0009,0.0143,0.001,0.0035,0.0137,0.0218,0.0007,0.0006,0.0012,0.0047,0.0015,0.0022,0.0007,0.0013,0.0019,0.0003,0.0002,0.0005,0.0012,0.0004,0.0007,0.0024,0.0721,0.0044,0.0006,0.0016,0.0022,0.0021,0.0008,0.0011,0.0032,0.0055,0.0013,0.0009,0.001,0.002,0.0038,0.0012,0.0017,0.0465,0.0069,0.0015,0.003,0.003,0.0056,0.0028,0.0009,0.0013,0.0004,0.0025,0.0001,0.0014,0.0004,0.0023,0.006,0.0039,0.0015,0.0013,0.0016,0.0009]}
{"id":2065,"ended":true,"length":522,"text":"Fez was released on April 13, 2012 and sold 200 @, @ 000 copies in its yearlong exclusivity to the Xbox Live Arcade platform. Several months later, Polytron became embroiled in controversy when it announced the release of its first ever game titled Zero Hedge, which released on October 29th, 2013, in its second year of release.\nSome time later, the developer announced that it was launching an open-source project for those of us who had lost their wallets. The project, called Zero Hedge, was launched by developer and creator of the open-source game Total War, Ben Mendelsohn. Mendelsohn had previously published TSW and TGS games for the Xbox Live Arcade. One of the biggest surprises about that initial project, however, came in the form of a short cut video to the video. The cut is shown at the end of the video. As we all know, a cut from a game can always be more than a simple cut. A person is shown and shown a cut in the video. It is really a very strange cut. That\u2019s because there is no indication that the cut took place. As you can know, for whatever reason, everyone thinks and hopes that the cut wasn\u2019t the work of a certain person. Either that person or TSW was the one behind the cut. It is hard to make out the exact wording of the cut. If it didn\u2019t look like a cut, nothing could have been done about it other than to update the link link on the video. When I looked at the video, I immediately thought \u201cWhat the hell was that that cut-line?\u201d That was the cut that I was seeing in the early-August 2014 release of Total War and the first time I heard any of the game\u2019s name. The rest of the video seemed to be a cut that was being used as a cut-line by some. This cut-line, which was made in partnership with publisher EA Play, was the one that actually released TSW. Ben Mendelsohn and the team at Total War were able to make it look like a cut-line. So it is understandable that they were able to make it look like it was taken from a cut-line.\nUnfortunately, while the cut was actually taken from a cut-line, there is an extra cut on it. It was made entirely on a single tape. That means, that the game was not cut from a single game or from TSW. And according to YouTube, those of us who had lost our money might be able to get this cut-line removed. With that said, it looks like there is a reason the cut cut hasn\u2019t been removed from the video that we will see in the upcoming future.","token_len":571,"entropy":[10.2622,4.9004,4.9825,2.2144,4.539,3.5168,0.75,2.944,2.2781,6.8182,7.5953,12.4279,6.631,6.4411,11.3589,7.7033,1.6509,3.4597,8.2084,5.8037,8.9458,0.2346,5.2197,2.5818,6.3933,1.839,1.297,5.1316,0.3765,7.9093,2.6475,0.2301,0.2827,8.6776,6.6706,0.0239,5.5223,4.7535,0.0757,2.6429,1.4676,0.9226,2.4068,2.5529,2.4624,0.1745,2.3011,2.4856,3.4584,2.6486,4.9784,6.9275,5.4806,1.7267,1.4625,5.5171,0.9288,3.0335,3.4849,3.0004,0.384,1.6752,2.3514,3.3208,3.3874,3.2727,1.6111,0.8905,2.2077,0.3662,1.3999,14.2443,2.558,0.668,0.1357,2.2229,3.5285,2.2044,1.0903,1.1563,1.4196,4.8778,2.688,3.7397,1.7556,1.6127,1.9951,3.7125,6.8022,3.2316,0.8967,0.4514,3.8148,6.0875,1.5667,6.9222,2.3621,2.0092,2.0384,1.6425,1.4494,1.6565,0.1352,0.8501,1.3825,3.5484,2.2916,4.2302,3.4943,3.3657,1.2576,0.9652,5.1221,0.3238,0.0571,1.6726,7.3658,2.0738,2.6505,5.3356,6.3308,0.0637,0.0021,0.0,0.8327,4.3239,0.0023,0.0008,0.0003,3.6843,2.25,4.6063,7.2214,5.9699,2.2806,4.6854,3.1555,3.5787,2.1805,1.5712,1.682,2.904,0.0172,1.7782,5.2813,0.5177,0.5294,3.6732,4.982,2.9665,5.9745,4.9437,2.9792,2.0051,0.7463,0.0037,3.7855,2.2912,1.1778,0.1377,0.0037,1.4284,5.8683,5.9768,3.8874,4.9432,1.1924,3.0665,3.0311,2.0185,3.9086,2.7922,4.2871,4.3316,0.3515,1.8639,0.2084,0.2134,0.383,1.3382,4.6878,3.2888,2.825,0.1562,0.2941,3.588,1.7381,4.042,1.3775,1.5511,2.6223,6.3032,0.4201,4.9278,1.1497,1.3195,4.6155,1.3907,1.0048,4.0002,6.67,3.9903,4.9284,6.6367,4.3728,1.5034,1.0451,3.4994,1.4309,0.8173,1.2543,2.7257,1.4301,5.5075,2.449,2.9071,4.3742,2.5434,1.1557,4.7826,18.8569,7.182,4.1678,5.0987,3.2001,1.0685,1.3534,6.2111,1.1339,1.1367,1.687,5.504,0.0309,1.5833,4.6592,1.8682,0.47,7.3544,0.5171,5.6313,5.8213,0.0499,0.6318,5.7358,6.6568,7.2782,7.197,0.6046,1.1935,0.8549,4.8325,5.0332,1.0918,0.544,3.4175,5.454,0.0537,1.4513,6.157,1.3012,0.5618,6.7435,1.3054,3.8543,3.0691,8.0597,0.1773,1.922,2.5329,3.3533,4.1412,0.7693,0.6536,0.5097,2.6663,1.6648,3.9989,0.1397,4.1633,2.9001,1.4671,2.0261,5.0503,0.6322,0.6695,1.165,1.511,4.2206,2.0824,5.043,0.9048,0.1037,0.0118,4.385,0.1845,1.4082,0.6881,0.821,7.1354,2.1009,1.6981,0.6736,1.8141,2.0667,0.0564,5.5766,0.029,1.5733,6.1236,0.4418,5.9568,7.6145,3.3197,0.4229,2.479,0.973,4.5572,2.4335,3.4264,0.6666,0.4392,1.0151,0.8195,0.621,4.8677,2.3514,5.4138,5.1454,6.5342,2.5349,1.3061,2.3118,1.2828,5.7922,3.4855,6.7251,6.0818,1.9759,0.7884,7.2332,3.3346,1.7653,2.1143,1.1646,2.208,2.4055,1.8588,2.8284,2.97,0.3758,6.9085,4.4194,5.2142,4.4223,3.3783,0.8398,1.508,0.0043,3.9389,2.2417,3.3352,2.6568,0.8054,2.5852,4.4993,2.2404,1.0163,4.3783,2.9776,0.5478,0.625,3.7597,1.1884,2.5135,6.0216,0.5432,0.2937,1.6111,6.1582,0.4145,0.8618,2.0149,3.8319,2.9672,1.412,4.8507,3.0467,2.2524,0.6696,3.4422,4.0633,0.3396,2.4908,2.364,3.4227,3.5573,3.1559,3.041,0.0556,3.1746,2.8055,1.7112,4.038,2.5401,5.8621,0.0296,5.6292,5.3042,6.3399,0.7429,1.1275,3.1044,3.5167,0.661,5.1465,4.5964,4.3945,0.0498,1.2566,7.1907,0.8614,0.0048,0.0018,0.0003,3.0789,2.8922,1.999,1.452,1.6205,0.0053,2.0542,3.1524,0.0031,2.3994,2.7635,2.8813,0.4357,1.0763,0.2965,1.7783,0.0223,1.5869,4.5882,2.7681,1.9287,5.4384,0.4417,2.5772,2.2372,1.1618,0.0023,1.181,1.3026,0.0653,0.2115,4.4784,0.4136,5.6073,0.7376,0.7082,1.0378,1.1753,0.0262,0.7974,2.3189,6.0405,0.2478,4.912,1.6822,1.8327,1.3696,3.4092,2.6221,0.1887,0.384,0.3596,0.5782,0.0158,0.2662,2.261,2.006,3.8556,5.1732,3.1797,3.7835,4.3535,1.4372,2.2855,1.7719,2.9379,5.2148,3.4339,2.0081,4.1075,5.6413,1.2855,2.9941,2.8022,3.894,2.4905,1.5702,2.7898,1.3643,2.8057,2.4992,1.5195,0.6185,2.4197,5.1683,3.8027,3.1113,4.9651,0.1023,0.4013,4.8048,6.569,0.0037,7.6147,1.3057,5.2964,3.4623,0.9072,0.1262,1.6196,0.3646,1.3148,3.0438,6.0805,2.3817,0.608,0.0197,1.5321,4.003,0.7758,2.1309,0.1522,5.0073,1.39,6.1319,1.2424,2.2798,0.0216,2.1716,3.4507,0.1745,2.3061,1.0314,1.3379,3.5879,3.7714,0.9865,4.4826,6.3237,1.149,0.1255,0.0257,0.3493,0.7447,1.9928,0.5692,1.2882,5.184,3.2733,2.8478,3.3117,1.2199,0.677,3.6797,5.1852,0.1236]}
{"id":3582,"ended":false,"length":497,"text":"In 2001 Stephen and Sylvia Czerkas compiled a traveling exhibit containing 34 other Chinese fossils. The show is titled Feathered Dinosaurs and the Origin of Flight. The San Diego Natural History Museum paid $60,000 for the exhibition.\n\nIn 2007 a group of researchers and engineers turned the exhibition off for an hour while they made a search for evidence of a human, perhaps from the first world war. But now a new project has found evidence of the body of the remains. The research team has turned the exhibition off and are hoping nothing changes in the future.\n\nThe skeleton and remains of a female and five other creatures was discovered on one of Stephen\u2019s two ships. They were located in an area off Mexico, but the archaeologists have had to turn it off.\n\nThe team discovered the remains to help find out what the body looks like on a long voyage \u2014 about 3,500 years ago. \u201cWe started out looking at fossils off the Pacific Northwest, but the sea is rough and we can\u2019t do a lot of digging,\u201d said Professor Dr. David Denny.\n\n\"So with this collection we can dig, or at least learn what they look like and maybe they\u2019re pretty much extinct.\" Stephen, pictured in October 2001.\n\n\u201cA lot of the bones we found in Mexico in 2007 have been buried in an area where we have been underwater for a long time,\u201d said Dr. David Denny. In February 2008 Dr. Denny said the research team decided to turn the exhibit off.\n\nDr. David Denny\n\n\u201cThey probably buried all the bones in an area where we have been underwater since at least 20 years ago,\u201d Boon said.\n\nDr. David Denny was on the first board of the project in 2001, while Stephen was on the second board. \u201cYou start to get the idea that the museum would do anything to protect against the extinction of the fossil of the time,\u201d Boon said.\n\n\u201cWe just kept the exhibit on, and so do we.\u201d\n\nDr. David Denny\n\n\u201cWe still have three days to find out what it looks like on what date and where it happened.\u201d\n\nThe new discovery raises the possibility that life might have been just around the corner on either side. \u201cIt would have at least been in a different place than it sounds like there was a short period of time between the ships and any scientific advances,\u201d Boon said.\n\nDr. David Denny\n\n\u201cSo we need to find out who and what happened. In the long run it raises hope that maybe humans may have been just around the corner on either side.\u201d","token_len":571,"entropy":[9.1212,9.7755,4.7733,7.3515,5.6818,6.693,4.1931,7.4146,0.6213,10.5032,5.9449,7.8481,7.8976,6.8949,8.6857,6.3703,1.7442,1.7988,3.8015,2.7644,4.732,7.4056,6.5693,0.0825,4.8438,0.0055,2.6102,2.9844,5.2684,0.1033,7.5072,1.0186,2.0945,9.2911,0.9774,5.8906,0.0366,0.0761,7.407,1.4866,4.3598,0.1459,0.017,0.8723,0.5627,3.5205,0.7876,0.7496,0.0008,3.0075,3.2508,3.2417,2.368,0.1808,2.2982,4.122,4.8924,6.3784,2.1499,4.9267,5.5384,2.9095,4.4229,4.0283,4.5818,1.7237,5.1161,1.5431,6.1747,0.3045,3.3033,0.5544,2.2138,3.1317,5.4994,5.2456,3.7968,1.4112,5.0926,4.4383,0.5119,0.2922,4.1091,4.1279,2.5555,2.1085,4.4085,2.2767,2.4639,2.1453,0.6789,2.4248,5.7262,0.6261,2.733,5.5978,1.3335,2.3385,4.5559,0.7925,2.9075,4.2204,1.0232,2.5533,1.3627,2.9432,5.0782,3.5963,10.2542,3.5022,2.8146,0.5354,2.2804,0.1836,0.4022,0.0003,2.0115,5.6342,4.4612,4.7739,0.8607,1.5784,3.8046,4.9603,6.2148,2.503,5.4566,3.9395,1.4952,2.6896,6.8151,0.1748,9.1287,12.7456,7.8479,0.3139,4.9261,6.834,2.2562,2.7405,0.8883,5.5593,1.2685,3.5471,0.7934,4.1457,5.6842,3.5686,3.651,1.8845,4.3264,2.3488,5.5498,1.1623,3.4471,1.5732,1.8371,2.5964,1.0801,0.0004,1.9197,2.7367,3.1278,1.2007,1.6803,6.1321,3.7162,4.0079,1.5272,1.7446,2.4694,4.4018,3.4402,0.0014,3.9364,2.423,5.1644,3.7742,6.2886,4.014,3.8645,0.3753,1.6434,0.8826,0.5011,0.4581,8.9945,6.4542,7.5361,5.535,3.2602,2.1588,1.4827,3.2906,5.0621,0.7259,4.1815,2.7968,1.439,0.7316,3.2184,4.3108,3.5106,6.3508,1.3238,2.1651,3.1533,15.7473,2.4418,0.0801,3.7494,3.438,0.9907,0.7642,2.5634,3.171,4.097,9.4633,3.259,5.7855,6.2458,0.1041,3.7036,4.5486,5.97,2.7534,0.8673,0.0002,1.6102,3.8091,6.0335,1.9196,6.2243,1.6833,3.534,5.5341,4.2183,5.8493,3.6193,0.0643,4.9079,3.9108,3.6181,1.3926,0.0106,2.3614,4.4111,4.1713,2.9037,0.1603,3.1896,5.9025,1.3956,2.3986,2.8653,7.3015,3.0098,6.817,2.0667,5.591,4.8988,2.5358,0.7389,0.0002,2.6104,1.7794,4.0103,4.1572,0.1067,1.8626,3.0167,3.1266,0.6651,2.2411,3.5876,4.8416,4.4318,3.6377,1.0527,4.7356,0.8042,4.3228,0.3363,3.7787,2.6588,2.6618,2.7082,7.8913,0.8387,1.6964,0.71,0.0604,1.4077,0.6665,1.1887,0.666,1.1293,0.0108,1.3843,0.318,0.0011,0.5074,5.2125,6.557,3.2916,3.5087,0.0167,1.1152,0.0013,3.1838,1.4329,4.321,0.2896,3.7556,0.234,1.1873,0.7295,2.1997,0.2331,1.6194,0.5,0.0003,4.2731,0.0097,1.4375,0.1394,0.0017,3.3265,0.0002,1.6353,0.2573,3.8238,6.6071,5.322,3.0251,0.8419,1.2552,1.5498,2.547,0.1668,0.6096,1.0407,1.0137,0.2061,0.1402,5.1376,3.6728,0.0027,4.4836,2.4896,0.2133,0.8413,0.3717,0.355,9.3123,5.9856,1.4118,0.0555,0.5206,0.0002,3.8764,0.0051,0.5149,0.0084,0.0021,5.0367,3.9763,1.0348,4.2773,6.977,0.8987,0.8448,4.8755,2.8938,3.4397,1.8882,5.1119,2.1884,0.6952,1.0573,0.4786,0.3908,2.4225,0.9025,4.2048,0.1204,5.7298,5.2887,1.5671,2.6761,2.0474,1.0412,0.8381,2.4061,4.3258,4.174,3.882,4.4311,0.61,3.6174,6.2053,2.0092,4.9215,0.3749,1.5551,3.601,5.7014,1.5142,6.1663,1.482,0.3886,0.5587,1.4448,0.0008,0.082,0.033,0.2506,0.0002,1.4157,0.0444,2.2047,4.5016,4.0491,4.378,3.7894,1.7734,2.3143,1.2481,5.0591,7.2005,3.1257,1.7184,2.4188,1.8896,1.133,0.0002,3.3426,0.0035,0.2876,0.0082,0.0021,0.5628,0.0002,0.4776,0.0307,1.2722,5.0308,1.022,5.1652,4.1219,1.2019,2.6748,0.6175,0.499,2.909,0.5749,0.0012,1.3886,7.3625,4.7485,3.5006,2.0442,1.1793,4.1313,0.8757,0.801,0.5955,0.4957,0.0002,2.6775,4.3796,2.5826,4.3156,1.3691,0.8602,0.3636,6.2603,2.4856,0.176,1.8774,6.4265,1.9295,0.8454,0.0644,3.548,6.0688,0.479,3.3448,3.1395,0.1163,2.3658,3.1119,1.2792,8.3407,0.0563,1.4449,3.4494,3.2413,3.9869,1.6662,2.6925,2.4591,8.0031,2.3561,4.9167,2.6472,3.1333,6.7683,1.6957,0.3691,0.1126,2.5018,0.8785,7.2155,2.0689,6.6982,6.7334,4.5675,2.348,0.2466,0.3099,1.0203,0.0005,0.045,0.0187,0.2025,0.0002,3.6247,0.003,0.2287,0.0098,0.0017,0.3218,0.0001,0.2777,0.0326,3.5258,1.818,4.4655,0.1706,1.7744,0.4236,4.2032,4.8723,0.5452,3.0235,3.5626,7.1819,1.2249,4.1189,0.7079,1.9764,6.8348,5.0722,0.8741,3.0953,4.1384,2.2086,0.083,1.1519,4.6771,0.3088,0.2048,0.0262,1.9925,0.8707,0.036,1.2883,1.4074,0.4436]}

{"id":3879,"ended":false,"length":531,"text":"Hamm received his breakthrough role in 2007, when he was cast from more than 80 candidates as the protagonist character Don Draper, in AMC's drama series Mad Men. In the series' second season, the 30-year-old actor plays a much hotter and more handsome, hothead who has an unlikely career future ahead of him.\nIn addition to playing the role of Draper's \"favourite guy\" onscreen, he also has a cast of supporting cast from the 2013 drama series Mad Men, as well as multiple co-stars and cast.\nThis is just a sample of the lineages of M. P. Soman's Mad Men, as the actor also portrays the eccentric and ruthless man who has kept himself in good stead as he has found his place in the US. With nearly two decades of experience making movies, he has become a leading man in the acting arena with many successful documentaries to his credit.\n\"He also worked on the Netflix series Lost in Love (Netflix series), and in 2002, he returned to work on Amazon Prime to begin the second season of his Showtime drama series Mad Men. Soman has become known for his ability to play complex characters in movies and TV series, in movies where you expect unexpected, but entertaining moments. Don't believe that I'm just saying this, he is quite capable in many things I have observed. I see Don Draper as a role model for young adults, who look at him with that same admiration as they do when they see him,\" Soman who has made almost 50 films in his career of over 30 years.\nThe cast\nMad Men is also made up of five male leads who are played by the likes of Hugh Grant as Draper in the show, Paul Berenson as Draper, and Kate Garraway as Draper in the series, who both play their roles of Don Draper.\nWhile the cast is a lot like the originals, M. P. Soman and his team have done an amazing job with keeping the cast together for the best scenes in the series.\nCindy Crawford, John Travolta, Jason Alexander, and John Lithgow have also reprised their roles as Draper's family on-screen.\nTalking about the cast members, director Robert Altman said, \"I am thrilled to have worked with M. P. Soman. I am delighted that he made it his mission to create an authentic voice for the people who see a look of his and his family's journey to an end. We were so fortunate to have him as a lead in a drama series Mad Men, so I hope we continue to get on well. With such great fans who have taken part in every Mad Men role they have done in the past, I am sure that we will continue to be remembered for our amazing work in Mad Men.\"","token_len":573,"entropy":[9.6108,10.8418,3.0308,9.2845,5.5847,0.7179,6.3041,1.8772,2.0346,0.4041,2.2643,2.2227,8.0893,8.3381,0.152,4.4872,10.0422,4.5281,1.2958,5.3243,8.0585,8.2658,2.4425,1.743,2.6616,5.9862,0.0216,5.1435,1.7975,4.7535,0.05,0.2409,3.1209,1.3222,2.1391,2.9488,2.7437,0.0349,0.0728,2.4343,6.1719,0.0547,0.1768,0.033,0.0012,2.7472,4.5165,1.5456,7.2137,7.0148,2.4249,0.6653,5.3876,3.1147,6.0287,3.2455,1.828,2.4791,3.3344,5.4966,4.9708,6.6296,3.7276,0.1198,0.1394,0.3224,0.7688,15.7028,3.0889,0.1081,2.9606,1.6851,2.8738,0.4858,1.0963,1.931,4.2278,4.858,4.8314,0.006,3.0823,1.7873,2.7663,5.9227,0.1591,3.0867,1.2642,3.3546,0.8719,7.3567,0.2943,3.6917,3.8433,5.8661,2.032,7.626,3.7601,2.4297,4.0586,0.1026,1.0517,2.1263,0.0657,0.0107,5.5504,4.3063,0.0033,0.1828,2.5878,4.5775,6.2977,0.7482,5.2027,2.4754,3.1402,2.8068,4.6198,0.121,0.5562,8.0981,6.1866,1.4689,6.642,1.4862,8.056,0.0683,4.2285,9.7128,1.8513,5.1325,0.002,2.5327,3.5777,2.8553,3.9287,3.7826,5.0097,1.8462,5.6556,2.0168,5.6136,5.232,1.3804,2.4057,6.6191,2.7138,2.2032,5.262,2.9332,3.6014,2.3588,2.2922,5.0331,1.3397,2.8711,0.7969,0.7387,6.2721,2.5313,5.7555,6.229,3.0145,0.3468,0.4626,1.0951,6.1927,2.459,0.9377,2.1574,1.6465,4.0415,1.2788,4.3873,1.9337,0.8731,0.7957,5.3425,4.903,2.8838,3.8759,3.8148,6.9014,4.9513,0.3344,1.0057,0.54,0.6849,3.5765,3.5953,6.474,5.5135,1.3154,1.6514,5.3142,0.6472,5.7624,1.7518,5.5938,3.6218,5.1913,3.0829,1.5021,1.8781,3.1336,6.661,1.3227,0.8639,6.2164,0.3096,3.34,0.7727,7.7529,3.0054,5.0012,4.665,2.7529,3.2912,0.0823,0.9546,2.5507,4.4103,2.8721,2.5065,3.315,0.0483,1.6773,5.9586,0.0207,1.7026,4.4139,3.1776,0.5538,0.4208,3.8272,0.0165,3.6915,5.0515,0.5736,2.1713,4.4726,1.213,1.3633,2.2128,1.0259,5.1693,6.0465,3.5307,5.0,5.5218,7.872,4.0767,3.9218,6.3072,2.8599,1.5589,6.519,6.4764,3.8803,3.8714,3.1358,1.8635,2.3614,1.5026,2.6534,1.5762,2.5935,1.8272,5.5021,3.2729,3.3788,2.9075,3.6495,4.7445,1.7651,5.884,1.8999,1.8784,5.0507,3.93,1.5011,0.8088,0.8614,5.2089,1.0077,1.0245,2.7091,3.2494,1.6495,2.6146,4.5583,2.8003,1.497,1.7628,4.6528,1.708,5.4971,3.044,1.4256,1.4733,3.0923,0.4593,0.7553,1.3716,4.3685,1.7392,0.0014,8.4358,2.1549,3.7996,5.5911,3.337,1.0446,2.1058,1.3054,0.2792,7.7821,2.47,2.0517,0.3148,1.9294,0.4429,2.9269,4.5857,5.3273,3.6642,0.0057,2.1038,3.5554,5.1318,0.1584,0.0362,3.9287,4.6902,3.2625,2.639,1.6815,3.9582,0.0669,3.0118,2.3609,0.0042,5.7427,3.2859,4.8509,2.4969,4.3632,0.8847,2.0031,0.8189,5.2866,6.0347,1.6704,0.0104,0.1399,1.8166,2.5247,3.0161,6.1185,11.5262,7.1766,0.3507,0.1284,1.0287,1.183,0.6507,1.7026,2.4736,3.2857,4.9571,2.2371,3.3425,0.9446,3.9627,3.9641,0.6409,2.0865,1.2155,4.3449,1.4485,1.5368,1.7866,3.4084,3.9291,3.2081,1.0126,5.9569,0.3972,4.9284,0.0595,0.105,0.011,0.0465,0.0044,3.5219,1.1359,2.0124,1.6649,4.0221,2.7179,1.3152,0.0062,2.5904,5.3743,0.7386,2.1991,2.0599,3.7888,1.2949,4.5939,7.4353,2.4236,0.5592,0.9295,0.4484,1.7834,6.0489,4.998,0.0454,5.9658,1.2121,5.5005,3.2472,0.4281,0.0017,0.0001,0.3131,5.4607,3.7291,0.2644,2.0133,4.4631,5.1474,0.0001,2.1509,2.2103,8.3509,0.0019,0.4577,0.063,1.2924,1.7478,2.3458,4.5701,4.5822,5.3183,0.1302,1.0667,0.9926,7.5627,0.448,0.7612,1.5444,3.6612,0.6128,4.0802,4.4746,3.8915,0.0013,0.7855,0.7813,0.0566,2.3896,2.4562,2.6685,0.5213,1.2492,3.8967,0.0743,2.5779,0.046,0.2264,0.0106,0.037,0.0426,2.9744,1.9552,1.3147,4.381,1.428,0.9056,5.2807,3.0306,3.2894,1.1707,0.069,2.5073,2.4249,2.9906,6.1351,0.43,1.2674,4.7324,1.7874,4.9075,4.7562,6.8132,1.4565,3.8791,4.2537,1.7617,0.947,3.0816,5.8275,3.5123,5.4479,2.825,0.7356,2.4444,3.3932,3.3305,2.9565,0.2232,1.0451,1.7914,2.104,1.2275,4.7276,1.4314,3.5081,4.7521,2.0031,9.4598,0.0019,1.438,2.9698,1.9255,3.2155,2.3768,4.1022,0.2837,4.161,5.1507,3.05,3.0874,4.8531,3.7994,3.1577,6.2815,3.791,1.5087,4.5439,2.5486,0.3072,5.1735,5.4706,0.0079,5.494,4.0732,0.5035,4.6977,3.3447,0.5606,0.7173,1.2313,1.3437,1.2036,1.7393,1.813,1.6534,0.428,0.8974,0.0949,2.8737,5.563,0.9843,1.4574,3.7737,1.2885,2.4359,2.4424,0.0029,1.029]}
{"id":1111,"ended":false,"length":522,"text":"Cresswell was born in Bridlington, East Riding of Yorkshire to George and Denise ( n\u00e9e < unk > ). He started playing for Bridlington Rangers at the age of eight before joining the club in 1991. The next season he was crowned champion of the Lotto Lotto, before joining Dundee United, before scoring twice in two wins. He also played for West Ham United in their Lotto U19 Championship \u2013 being named in their provisional side for the competition \u2013 and also for Sheffield Wednesday.\nIn his second season in Scotland, he scored 10 goals in 15 league games for Blackburn Rovers, scoring five.\nSouthend United were due to make a debut in the league only for their U18s to go out with the disappointing results.\nThe United and Rangers teams clashed in a heated last match to see who would be crowned Premier League champions on Saturday night at Wembley.\nHowever, with the game between Blackburn Rovers and Southend United set to be played on the road, and with both games against rivals Sheffield Wednesday to be played in south London, Southend played out a very close game that could have been a great victory for the United fans.\nSouthend, who were to face Arsenal at Wembley, suffered a 2-1 home defeat to Bury on Sunday where they lost out on a place in the knockout stage.\nWith the game still 2-2, Southend head coach Alex Ferguson insisted the United team needed to \"push out\" and \"go out\" after seeing how their rivals had handled this game.\n\"It was a good game. They've got a lot on their plates and we'll go out into a game and go out and do something special.\"\nDespite having played so well throughout, Southend conceded the game too early after having their first possession \u2013 but then quickly levelled following a shot from Adam Edwards, who was found on his half-way line by Neil Armstrong.\nRyan Christie, who missed late in the game after undergoing an eye injury during the pre-match warm up session, took a shot and was awarded his first goal in just their second game together.\nFerguson said: \"We were a bit out of ourselves playing in a little bit of a cold environment, but we went out and played some good football and played in front of our own fans, which was excellent.\n\"It was nice to see Southend have a couple of good games and a draw, but a draw makes it a tough game.\n\"We should have scored much better, especially early in the game, but you can't forget the pressure.\n\"Obviously, we need to push out and play with confidence. In the end, they did.\n\"We had a really tough game, let's hope we can get another one.\"","token_len":573,"entropy":[9.0709,2.3251,3.5199,3.9851,0.6547,10.1403,3.2027,0.3866,5.5656,3.9554,2.7178,0.9003,3.2698,6.4807,0.739,8.2963,2.8773,14.6116,4.0053,10.3068,9.9937,5.503,4.7133,4.8659,1.815,4.8745,2.7175,4.3643,5.4692,0.0913,4.7937,2.704,0.9143,0.04,0.0048,3.1376,3.7349,2.7029,1.55,2.9166,0.8769,3.9517,0.4566,3.6908,3.6683,2.0157,0.6921,1.6585,6.4909,3.7462,1.3061,0.2292,6.7316,3.4017,4.8546,0.1517,5.3795,5.1441,3.4668,6.8038,0.0273,0.1035,2.9262,2.6581,6.0962,4.0803,0.7964,4.5014,6.6443,2.3467,1.4561,3.0157,2.0265,0.7175,5.5988,1.0081,0.2173,1.6973,3.9012,7.1092,1.2462,6.0124,3.532,2.6341,7.6372,6.1061,1.1377,2.7119,1.7943,6.5378,4.9084,2.3591,0.4608,4.3444,2.9215,1.4891,3.2459,2.785,4.3261,0.7017,1.3532,1.5986,8.1352,2.8604,3.1559,0.6999,1.9769,4.9756,0.6479,0.8033,1.9591,4.1679,0.1734,0.9086,3.805,2.9244,0.4461,1.6812,6.0307,0.3391,0.0002,0.969,1.5836,2.9484,5.0026,2.3156,5.2909,5.9599,0.0716,0.3191,2.6225,6.997,0.0642,2.8276,1.0822,6.6099,1.921,0.7689,4.8152,6.1859,2.1499,3.4529,7.0942,1.7416,1.9194,0.2348,3.7401,2.6437,2.8623,2.7737,5.0998,3.5696,1.1993,1.6376,2.9605,4.7381,5.9364,3.4292,4.1815,5.4847,1.4354,3.2386,5.2097,5.3902,3.9781,5.4372,3.4254,1.4563,0.8365,2.6164,1.4264,5.3869,0.0085,0.9151,3.5693,1.8592,2.6171,1.782,2.546,0.8708,1.0624,4.5941,0.2073,3.9046,1.6493,3.1932,4.5006,4.1877,0.2905,0.0001,0.0893,5.4501,0.0005,0.0005,1.0091,3.6935,0.2726,1.0878,1.6135,1.4613,2.1454,4.0008,1.2345,4.1513,1.564,3.3644,6.8453,3.3989,4.8558,4.1289,0.1412,4.4961,0.6064,0.4163,1.4703,5.8725,0.6233,0.3779,3.142,0.0003,0.003,5.7664,2.1673,1.3303,4.1074,2.8322,1.5972,3.5457,4.0441,0.6703,1.4987,2.1305,4.0944,3.6644,0.591,1.0803,2.5751,3.6966,0.4961,0.4285,2.3088,0.0865,0.0056,4.2022,1.326,2.0717,5.7108,2.3038,5.4953,1.7844,0.3276,1.2547,5.7233,0.5548,1.9848,0.0272,0.8636,3.1186,0.3175,0.9401,5.0388,2.2915,1.8657,2.0224,6.5106,1.2184,1.9685,6.0311,1.8542,1.3871,1.8784,0.0681,0.1165,4.6721,1.7672,0.6799,0.68,4.0976,1.4537,1.5494,3.7384,5.0925,0.0631,2.1376,0.6112,1.949,0.0002,0.005,5.9436,0.588,4.683,3.6105,5.1717,2.6668,4.0484,2.8198,4.3086,0.2488,3.9115,5.7993,4.2098,0.8797,1.5981,2.8381,3.5418,2.1848,1.8119,4.4446,5.1894,2.6987,2.5777,4.5922,2.5162,3.5166,4.7915,0.9939,0.3471,0.3386,1.0551,2.0738,0.6909,0.8409,2.9732,0.7746,2.2126,2.7825,4.336,1.2278,1.1569,1.1392,4.5154,0.294,3.9107,1.4892,1.4566,3.4663,3.1988,0.0862,6.6472,4.0329,3.0873,1.2988,3.4761,0.1881,0.9079,2.9232,2.4714,3.0965,4.1231,0.3245,4.572,3.0463,3.0677,4.4777,0.9299,5.4723,1.9535,1.7868,0.0004,0.0085,3.9934,2.3844,2.6867,5.9444,2.1045,3.7825,4.4148,3.9937,3.1781,4.5586,7.6515,3.9371,3.7716,5.8895,5.8148,0.0026,5.5888,0.7939,4.8513,0.7009,4.8742,6.4783,2.6449,0.9685,1.5768,5.3598,2.5953,3.4046,5.5057,0.9081,3.7505,0.9331,1.2115,6.3584,5.216,0.573,0.3159,7.4868,7.6127,1.3444,1.0814,5.4719,8.9928,1.9643,0.1239,1.4241,2.4198,6.5903,2.7268,6.0984,1.7542,3.9109,0.5853,4.0843,0.0102,0.9097,3.4343,3.0638,3.313,0.1891,4.4831,2.5219,2.5328,5.1352,1.996,3.3184,4.4755,1.4141,1.401,2.6792,5.3213,5.466,0.746,0.5852,4.7811,0.6668,0.3616,4.5798,0.0153,1.9818,0.671,0.0302,1.4357,2.5621,2.9057,0.9638,4.4459,0.5482,4.8872,5.3483,3.0051,1.8537,5.1684,0.2296,0.2323,0.3093,4.9812,2.5119,1.9497,1.2096,0.9634,3.827,0.4618,1.1447,1.4068,3.8176,0.9913,0.1486,1.2789,3.2798,4.6941,3.7225,0.0241,2.9548,2.0507,0.567,2.4815,2.7564,0.8369,5.7448,0.7484,0.8233,0.0754,1.9539,0.4483,4.2796,0.2126,1.3984,4.4113,0.0009,0.0054,4.0808,1.6381,3.9582,0.113,2.3869,1.1533,2.0217,3.1995,5.1715,2.0011,0.8714,4.5064,2.2492,5.6649,2.2963,1.5525,4.7034,0.6823,1.7102,2.0591,0.065,1.2386,4.98,0.6159,2.8954,5.8596,1.1689,2.1139,3.4808,5.0889,1.0926,0.0212,0.5478,0.9358,0.574,4.2637,1.8282,0.4371,4.7578,2.3554,4.3233,2.714,2.1425,0.0507,5.8186,1.2654,1.3785,3.2181,0.205,1.5974,0.2724,1.028,2.6741,3.8049,2.6359,1.791,5.017,0.9797,1.2635,0.4041,3.0845,2.6468,4.5052,2.4231,0.0578,1.4086,2.9511,0.8155,3.6657,3.8103,0.4518,1.5248,6.8773,0.1352,2.7524,1.2739,0.8743,1.627,3.7989,1.5295,2.4581]}
{"id":3735,"ended":false,"length":515,"text":"Zuko lies on the ground twitching as Katara and Azula fight. After several minutes of running and being unable to gain the advantage at first, Katara freezes Azula and chains her to the ground. When the sword breaks between Katara and Azula, the three of them burst, the sword breaking and the dragon plunging into the abyss.\n\nBored with the fighting, Katara runs towards the dragon and attacks him repeatedly. It takes the sword to heal her legs but the dragon has stopped running. Both dragons are exhausted from the fight and Katara begins to cry into her eyes, bleeding to and fro. Azula tries to reach Katara's side but Katara holds her still and cries. One of Katara's teammates walks by, showing her Katara's hand and saying \"Let's all just stop it\". Katara is in shock, and Azula gives off an intense rage before the whole scene ends.\n\nZuko stands off like a dragon, ready to punch the red dragon with his sword or shield. Azula was also very impressed with the training. Azula's training was very different from the training in Zuko's class, so Azula could see that Zuko and Katara were able to compete in a professional style.\n\nAt one point, Zuko and Katara were attacked by a wild dragon as well. Katara managed to make their way home safely.\n\nAfter a long time at the same time, Katara decided that she'd become brave and quit of her sport. Zuko's family was also affected by the incident, and Zuko felt betrayed by the dragon and the others. When both dragons had a fight against the dragon, the dragon decided to kill them both.\n\nThe dragons didn't have any revenge. As much as they tried to kill the dragons, they had made many mistakes with their first bite, and the dragons refused to accept what they had done to Azula. When Azula refused to give up, the dragons had another chance for revenge. At this point, Zuko decided that she would go back to school and become a teacher. She gave up on her plans and instead decided to set up a group as a special team to teach at the dragon gym. She started her group by fighting two new dragon types. The first was called the Red Dragon. She fought the dragon and was able to overpower it.

{"id":1188,"ended":false,"length":559,"text":"During their 15 @ - @ day rest periods the company's men congregated around the Belgian @ - @ owned Elizabeth Hotel, in the centre of the city at the corner of Causeway Bay and Paddington Lane. The group spent the first two nights'sleeping' before the hotel started up, and while they made two attempts to make it to the hotel, they were unsuccessful. \"We were there at 1am for breakfast,\" said the hotelier, who also works as an employee at the hotel, \"but that was around 6am and we had our lunch break and a late morning on and off.\" In fact, it was \"almost 6am on two separate nights\" for the hoteliers and the hotelier said the hotel had had to turn round because everything was broken down as early as 6am. After they'slept' at the hotel, they went off again just as their night got away from them. \"It was more than a bit weird because we were able to sleep because we had our breakfast, and we were there right around 5am. That's all I could speak about.\"\n\"But with the hotel being closed for a full week for our final rest period, and us not being able to go on with the work, it was very hard to see them again.\" \"We were very close to the hotel as well, but as we were sleeping, it was more difficult because it felt like we were at the same time. I know there's a lot of other places they've stayed at, but it's just something I didn't imagine they would do.\" \"The hotel was completely on lockdown, and we couldn't get into a hotel. We didn't know if we would get back to our normal lives, or if we would take the shuttle to the car park at the car park and then drive back off to London.\" \"We stayed at the Elizabeth Hotel until we were in the car park, about 20km away from the city centre,\" she added.

{"id":4172,"ended":true,"length":516,"text":"The architects for the new library were chosen through an international competition for a design contract worth C $ 4 @. @ 3 million. Four architectural teams were shortlisted, each a partnership with one of the best known European architects. They were chosen based on three designs and each of the four offers a distinct, well-rounded view of London. #BJLL_ #BJLL_ https:\/\/t.co\/Bw9C4NxWvV \u2014 James Cook Photography (@jamescookflorid) January 6, 2020\nThis year marks the 50th anniversary of the development of the London Underground, and one of the great landmarks in Europe. Following the successful bids by Londoners from all over Europe, the new project will incorporate modern and enhanced facilities for visitors as well as a shared library.\nProjects to be selected on behalf of the developers included architectural, landscape, health and luxury and luxury villas, as well as a range of design concepts, including the installation of a new multi-purpose bathroom, a range of water features and an expanded kitchen.\nThe selection of architects was prompted by the unique architecture that had been selected using a prestigious international competition for a design contract worth C $ 4. At the same time, the developers were also awarded a special award of \u20ac500,000, which was given to them in recognition of the achievement of an architect's reputation as a respected leader in the city centre.\nIn a statement after the award ceremony, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said \u201cthis prestigious award is just one way that our city has achieved remarkable improvement over the last 50 years. I want both our residents and visitors to feel the same by visiting the new library this year.\u201d\nThe BJLL UK team of architects will work with the council on the project, which will include a multi-level walk-in pantry, a new library pavilion, as well as a library and a space for the library.\nThe new library will be housed on the first floor of the new library, which is located beneath a greenhouses and a kitchen. The new pavilion is located next to the new library, in the same space which housed the original library. Also, at the entrance to the new library, the building itself will be transformed into a three-floor space allowing access to the library, the water feature and a new toilet.\nThe development of the new library at the BJLL, will come on a year after it was completed and the new library will be set up for visitors, with the new building still slated to open in the second half of 2020. At that stage, the library will be open to the public. In the next few years, the BJLL Project will continue to be the top attraction for visitors to London and the future of the London Underground as a global destination.","token_len":575,"entropy":[11.1501,4.7647,0.5908,2.8723,6.9843,2.6578,5.6459,4.8064,2.6363,4.0595,1.3959,3.7102,3.3832,3.4335,5.5968,5.3635,6.5809,8.6777,6.6365,12.9122,5.6517,5.3951,9.0524,3.8493,1.095,7.7328,5.9645,3.2868,2.4111,9.9397,0.0069,2.0248,3.8541,5.5544,8.122,1.9309,3.617,0.6248,0.6313,4.3778,4.0521,5.4512,1.4735,1.343,3.5791,1.4152,2.357,2.3731,0.0593,4.7427,8.0901,3.0327,3.603,2.6832,1.0685,1.6658,7.1845,3.2338,5.0127,3.7552,4.7456,0.5227,2.0577,4.3465,0.2645,2.9968,0.9331,6.6415,4.8892,5.753,6.9293,5.5624,5.4998,1.8103,0.5418,0.4226,1.0084,5.5354,0.0004,0.2102,0.0002,0.0001,0.0018,4.5384,4.2859,3.9577,4.5418,3.6566,4.5718,3.5191,4.1945,4.0526,4.0093,0.7387,5.7351,5.1845,5.4838,0.1187,1.1412,0.1156,0.1947,8.9534,2.758,2.4986,1.2756,2.5929,3.3823,0.0002,9.6364,0.1244,13.0579,3.6664,3.8138,0.2776,2.4591,0.0129,0.0721,0.012,0.3872,5.2641,0.1705,0.464,2.4498,2.1939,1.1228,1.5819,4.4122,0.2642,0.2194,4.0561,3.3518,1.7302,3.7214,0.6474,5.7585,0.6771,4.2618,6.4321,3.2684,3.0906,3.7381,4.1372,2.7976,0.3868,2.4337,0.3833,1.0194,3.3936,3.7184,1.5284,6.0252,4.8848,2.6007,8.6076,3.4653,2.7049,3.9251,4.8693,0.1584,0.0061,1.9849,6.7426,2.9136,1.5268,0.8708,7.2185,3.3681,3.2624,0.8277,4.4365,4.818,4.3263,0.0056,0.5933,4.5036,3.2639,6.7592,2.3921,4.4392,0.8762,6.1279,0.6346,7.9658,4.3403,5.4618,7.6878,0.064,1.0571,2.8696,0.0016,0.0078,1.8825,4.3983,0.0045,4.938,3.7541,1.9288,1.192,2.4813,5.655,0.0839,1.7707,2.4232,6.1845,0.0419,1.5385,5.9481,1.349,1.6306,6.4455,0.0017,5.4575,2.7189,1.1663,2.9181,2.9775,4.5751,0.8638,0.6917,1.2782,7.0916,1.1595,2.0303,1.5178,5.034,0.1673,0.7971,5.0926,4.1813,3.7956,4.302,0.5301,3.2695,6.0016,1.813,7.173,2.3867,0.6071,2.0165,0.5105,0.3023,0.0203,0.324,0.0675,0.1772,0.3441,3.6258,4.2276,0.5096,2.7761,0.0518,0.2875,0.8663,3.8241,1.5939,1.4511,4.9701,1.0786,3.9086,2.2491,2.81,4.9152,5.5035,0.2227,0.0502,2.1282,1.244,1.8689,2.265,0.2513,4.1071,2.7983,1.1544,0.0942,1.8669,5.2752,0.6517,5.1195,4.095,1.4281,5.1901,1.9186,0.8063,6.0863,4.2602,0.4104,1.1772,4.9275,5.4912,0.4992,0.388,3.4865,2.3992,0.8094,5.8132,0.2021,4.8628,0.5999,0.1479,2.6789,1.3276,0.1721,0.0,0.0012,0.54,12.2788,6.9653,6.7193,6.6408,0.3754,1.2318,4.7149,1.815,4.3436,1.0524,3.558,0.6927,2.0028,3.7876,5.4218,6.8146,1.5569,0.5772,1.4375,1.2936,0.0259,1.2101,4.2923,3.1163,7.7735,2.7362,3.0978,0.072,0.5685,0.0679,1.3317,2.2404,2.4856,6.4633,5.0823,1.1147,0.5976,1.2426,5.2362,1.0253,0.706,7.8698,6.3013,1.2553,1.934,10.6864,0.1871,8.4242,2.8293,4.4528,0.6814,2.0843,2.1788,0.9438,1.0698,6.6702,3.5484,1.1737,2.2013,1.4982,1.6144,0.5441,1.5153,1.8487,5.279,0.0154,2.7704,4.4426,2.16,0.6597,8.6595,0.0194,0.5215,1.1968,2.1352,2.7157,6.7547,0.0012,0.6122,4.7632,0.0062,0.0094,1.2216,4.5407,2.8402,2.4437,5.6759,0.5597,2.8506,3.886,3.2116,1.055,1.2389,2.6817,1.1117,0.4324,1.1096,4.6443,2.0456,1.1572,3.4025,0.125,0.3241,0.38,2.6406,3.331,1.5274,1.2229,1.7307,2.9812,5.6912,1.9514,5.085,10.022,1.9357,2.7925,5.7827,1.1002,1.0883,2.1935,7.0923,0.01,2.5637,3.1442,3.0894,0.1333,0.6171,2.4619,1.5508,1.0914,4.4651,0.8691,2.4693,2.2135,3.4159,4.0465,0.1758,2.1153,2.9127,0.8675,6.6842,2.3116,4.5476,0.1852,3.5592,0.8128,0.0325,0.5561,0.4496,0.8426,2.1132,3.7185,3.607,0.552,0.4667,3.4957,0.2275,0.3212,5.2859,0.3388,3.517,4.7168,5.7527,3.1771,0.2242,0.6636,2.8833,2.14,2.5893,6.0995,2.2508,1.0229,1.2855,2.0137,5.6445,0.4275,0.5649,0.9683,4.6831,1.2175,0.1906,0.7479,0.3065,5.9776,1.1134,2.9378,0.0043,4.3277,3.514,4.1929,3.6525,3.7104,4.1019,4.6892,3.3562,0.3784,1.5906,2.3643,2.3395,3.3587,1.8653,1.1601,0.7036,5.5027,1.4698,3.0635,4.1639,3.336,2.3115,1.512,2.6024,2.6964,6.3342,6.383,0.5071,1.4119,0.4739,2.5858,3.3118,0.4416,0.0063,1.4207,0.1191,5.7331,3.8143,3.2248,0.2562,0.762,3.4876,0.403,0.8932,1.9215,0.9548,0.6744,0.0227,2.2991,4.3454,1.6852,3.6938,0.9639,0.5669,0.1198,0.7001,2.9367,0.0013,8.379,0.2509,2.2822,0.5394,2.1525,3.5265,4.8395,1.5837,1.5271,0.5532,1.7059,1.3383,1.891,1.4951,3.1416,0.4607,0.6737,2.8921,0.6911,4.3235,0.9943,3.8911,2.5656,0.8943]}

{"id":187,"ended":true,"length":508,"text":"Upon the retirement of the Keeper of the London Museum, Harmon Oates, Wheeler was invited to fill the vacancy. He had been considering a return to London for some time and eagerly considered the possibility, when he was approached by an old gentleman a few years previously. The gentleman, a retired English soldier, thought he would be a good fit in place of the Keeper.\n\nIn spite of the advances made to the Keeper, Harmon Oates had lost his passion and lost the ability to be a good man. He did nothing, however, and after hearing these accusations and having little interest in the situation, he decided to rejoin the League. On October 3, 1904, he was appointed the chairman of the League of Londoners.\n\nIn May 1905 Harmon was promoted to the rank of Secretary. This he did for a period of three quarters of a century. His last term came with great disappointment. In March 1907, he was dismissed from his position as Secretary.

He also became a member of the Society of Colonial Commissioners.\n\nHarmon Oates was selected to represent London in the Association of Major League Baseball Players in 1918. He was also the first Member of the Court of Appeals. Harmon Oates was elected President of the Association in 1936.\n\nHarmon Oates left the League early on his fourth term and had no tenure. In 1922, Harmon Oates began working as a Member of the Court of Appeals.\n\nHarmon Oates resigned on September 24, 1925.\n\nHarmon Oates was succeeded by Frederick W.

{"id":4841,"ended":true,"length":550,"text":"F @ - @ Zero has been credited with being the game that set a standard for the racing genre and inventing the `` futuristic racing `` subgenre of video gaming. IGN credits the game with making the best videogame experience it ever saw. Also thanks to Zero and F, the world of videogames will always be a bright spot for us in time to come. #\n\nFriday, June 28, 2008\n\nNo official figures for the Xbox 360 GameSpot Rating but the system has achieved a significant milestone: it has been ranked in the top spot. It has become one of the top video and audio games in terms of ratings, both within the gamer community as a whole and online.\n\nSony had originally started doing the Microsoft Rating System back in 1999 and was a relatively modest company. With nearly two million people playing its first Xbox 360 game back then, it was at an astonishing pace to break a barrier in the world of video games. Xbox 360 is currently number 8 on the list and is projected to do so even though it is currently ranked fifth in the world of video games.\n\nThe Xbox 360 GameSpot Rating system has become so popular, it had been only available for six years and it has reached the top spot on the list of games in the world of video games. The Xbox 360 GameSpot Rating is ranked in alphabetical order which means that it matches up with a wide range of games that have been played on the Xbox 360 in various categories. It has a score of 1.3 of \u201ctop\u201d and has been rated only nine times.\n\nIt does not however mean that the system has reached the top 100 in terms of game ratings. It has been ranked as one of the top gaming titles of the year and has received a highly positive reception from gamers who have bought into it. It also appears that many Xbox 360 game scores are being considered by Sony to be more in-line with the Xbox 360.\n\nThe system also has become less well respected by the video game industry which has affected the Xbox 360\u2019s popularity. Some critics argue that the system needs more updates so that it can play at best 10% more games. In general, developers have tended to say that it is better to have updated features while still maintaining the same content which would make it easier for gamers to pick up as they play on an Xbox 360. But it seems that this attitude is changing as the Xbox One is now a preferred console by a large part of gamers who have not made their decision after seeing a number of excellent games released in the previous year. The first Xbox game to receive this rating was The God Of War II for its excellent graphics and content. In the latter, the overall rating is around 2.3 (5 stars) making it one of the most highly rated titles in the world of video games by gamers.","token_len":579,"entropy":[8.7447,5.9687,6.5448,10.2276,8.1569,1.9733,7.2043,0.5822,4.1415,0.7709,6.3087,4.7321,4.2836,3.8816,2.7756,0.3462,2.0316,7.1832,0.9316,3.0029,11.8409,0.8505,1.3233,12.5274,12.6091,1.2756,6.1884,6.9553,0.1758,1.8706,3.9947,3.4543,0.4584,8.2353,7.6569,3.0787,1.2841,1.5084,2.8764,1.4881,5.3129,6.0402,0.3348,3.7625,5.613,3.3382,5.7323,0.6756,6.1479,5.8965,0.8175,3.6075,2.7917,6.2171,5.1758,2.1429,4.3206,1.5446,4.1266,0.2736,4.0776,2.5596,0.3846,1.8563,5.7919,1.9779,1.2784,2.6086,3.0288,6.9507,2.1994,1.4162,0.2994,4.9151,5.42,0.0048,9.4392,0.2223,2.8397,3.2031,0.2698,3.6465,1.0877,0.0002,6.0576,7.2306,6.9225,1.887,1.5303,5.8646,1.2691,6.0553,5.0017,5.2898,5.3747,2.8356,5.9884,2.1475,7.2168,1.3726,4.9475,2.457,3.3691,2.0738,0.9829,1.4292,3.8552,4.0672,0.4152,0.4201,6.662,3.5397,3.121,1.8497,3.5247,3.234,0.009,0.1102,2.2483,3.3178,7.5427,2.3282,0.8917,1.4048,5.4171,0.0011,4.5143,1.8737,4.2565,4.225,0.4403,6.0165,0.5452,2.6996,2.3758,0.0037,0.1506,5.1837,0.6932,2.3546,0.0002,5.9735,5.326,3.9438,4.7229,5.3391,2.1447,7.5423,5.7675,3.3996,3.0607,0.0527,3.2311,2.3423,3.1717,4.113,5.5868,5.2697,2.3492,1.7763,4.0856,6.9091,3.7002,1.7907,3.1022,1.6279,3.3336,5.0961,3.4836,0.6844,0.7527,5.0853,1.6422,0.3208,1.3853,1.1355,4.6409,4.9572,5.8262,2.6444,2.9752,3.666,3.7504,5.9549,2.6179,1.0856,3.7832,0.0196,0.7728,0.9214,0.4119,5.8055,0.6033,3.1686,4.2825,4.0958,5.7643,0.4948,0.456,2.7301,3.8958,2.0665,5.8339,0.0799,5.2042,2.5202,5.4579,3.0618,1.0097,1.4362,3.2526,2.6091,4.6187,1.4303,0.4625,1.2104,1.9094,0.6518,0.4577,0.5872,0.9576,0.0002,1.9878,1.6679,0.1596,1.773,0.0302,0.6722,1.7709,1.918,3.0219,3.3627,0.5662,3.177,1.4345,4.6558,2.1069,6.176,3.0249,1.2224,5.081,1.6125,2.2098,2.6399,1.6887,4.0635,1.9258,1.3381,2.3326,2.1212,0.64,1.2435,1.3935,3.5528,2.1012,0.5781,0.924,0.5983,0.26,0.2602,0.7422,2.1219,2.365,0.0495,1.112,0.0127,0.4415,3.4316,5.1578,2.2236,8.33,0.0057,0.0066,6.0232,1.1068,0.7309,1.3219,7.3311,2.6932,1.1515,3.4388,3.2216,0.8689,0.0032,2.2296,2.4316,1.9978,0.7658,3.0824,1.2128,0.5965,1.0679,0.2425,2.6013,4.5729,2.7382,0.9453,2.6734,1.99,3.2497,4.6083,0.2619,3.125,1.3614,4.0604,6.1035,15.267,6.4853,9.8845,8.9162,6.772,2.5638,3.0516,1.3106,2.1152,6.53,6.0124,0.0725,1.6938,0.8746,0.0002,3.2694,5.0055,0.5696,5.7313,3.172,0.0612,1.0131,1.7609,1.9917,3.7532,0.7963,0.8728,5.4383,1.9128,2.9971,0.0007,3.6476,1.3635,0.6911,1.886,1.2859,1.5286,1.5525,3.3904,1.8697,0.0107,0.0991,0.487,4.4708,3.2465,1.3804,1.0174,0.8661,1.9915,1.6641,3.6944,1.6943,6.0385,2.3824,1.8157,0.9934,1.6882,3.0792,1.1508,3.6459,2.157,2.332,0.3862,2.3365,2.4873,5.4272,0.8736,3.7863,3.7972,0.1813,3.2764,5.7691,1.1632,3.0735,4.0414,2.3885,6.1316,2.3922,0.1384,4.2646,4.925,3.8982,0.9881,0.0193,0.991,2.8655,0.5424,2.4478,0.7685,0.0002,1.9077,3.3178,2.4274,1.3273,3.7901,5.7459,5.357,5.6671,1.6256,1.771,3.218,0.1538,1.6698,3.9554,1.0199,7.4325,0.9677,3.7318,0.0618,14.7415,7.0217,4.4584,2.3003,0.9772,4.296,2.4391,3.8872,0.0508,0.8513,1.0204,6.0408,2.7168,4.5802,4.5515,0.6467,0.3619,0.8803,5.5069,4.0884,6.57,4.2928,3.4136,1.7857,0.3903,1.588,3.5783,5.1,0.4632,4.7703,1.5641,4.8238,0.0539,5.649,0.1542,2.4831,0.7974,2.5128,0.6788,1.6993,6.7707,4.7202,4.6346,1.9476,1.8716,1.2121,1.5906,5.3478,4.7725,4.165,1.9603,1.1985,2.4029,0.9564,2.5491,0.1514,3.808,0.1961,5.5973,1.126,1.1499,4.0392,4.8512,0.2191,0.2203,0.2782,4.8162,2.8673,2.3023,0.2775,3.0502,4.0317,1.4136,2.0388,1.9079,1.882,1.2103,5.9972,2.3448,2.3516,3.0571,7.7543,2.5843,3.3588,2.3896,1.1491,3.1712,0.0069,2.3253,2.4916,2.0335,3.662,5.6317,3.2818,2.7878,6.0044,2.8089,2.9752,3.3198,0.0019,5.5249,0.7207,3.4763,2.8578,0.4805,3.958,1.2304,0.2147,3.4178,5.8411,2.5372,5.211,1.5946,2.2372,2.9063,1.5981,0.743,2.868,5.3023,7.7045,0.052,4.5186,4.1937,4.6269,4.5327,1.6142,1.0272,6.7851,0.5831,3.7251,1.7792,5.3377,2.7063,1.377,5.9953,1.8311,2.0506,5.8625,2.8117,0.4471,2.429,4.8826,5.5895,3.1438,0.9362,7.6425,0.2593,1.4958,0.0103,0.0467,2.4169,2.7455,0.7588,2.7521,1.8338,0.2534,2.1729,0.7766,0.1171,0.2521,5.1157,2.5983,0.3172]}

The movie studio has achieved a significant milestone in its business model, in comparison to other studios in the Disney-ABC franchise, because by working with Disney, Pixar and Star Wars Disney studios has become a part of the Disney-ABC business (i.e. the company that owns the properties of the company\u2019s most famous movies). This is because Pixar Animation Studios is part of Disney\u2019s distribution network, which allows Disney to distribute the animated film in China, USA and Brazil. Even in China Disney is able to obtain several billion Chinese viewers through Disney+. In addition, Disney has been working closely with China Media Group (MGM) that has a partnership with Disney. As part of its efforts to support China\u2019s development industry, in November 2015 Disney launched a partnership with Disney-owned TV series \u201cTao Tzu\u201d, which was created in collaboration with the director of Pixar Animation Studios, Jim Toussaint. The series is the story of a young Chinese girl who discovers that she is one of the seven great \u201cChinese Children\u201d, but also has potential to become one of Disney Channel\u2019s children.

{"id":4385,"ended":true,"length":560,"text":"During their engagement at Big John's, Butterfield met and occasionally sat in with guitarist Mike Bloomfield, who was also playing at the club. By chance, producer Rothchild witnessed one of Butterfield's early songs, \"Tornado.\" Butterfield revealed to Bloomfield, \"I didn't see it, didn't hear it, and probably didn't pay attention.\" Bloomfield added, \"I really thought it was pretty cool.\"\nThe next day, Bloomfield and Butterfield got to share a stage, where Bloomfield was playing the guitar and Berry was playing the keyboards and drums, but Butterfield could not focus. He had to try new gear and learn quickly. Soon after Bloomfield had left the bar, Bloomfield recorded a new song, \"Can't You Hear My Voice?\" on his home station. After they performed the song in his bedroom, Bloomfield said \"I just need to let a little part out. \"\nHe also worked on his own solo albums, \"The Fence and the Sound\" and \"The Dark Shadows,\" which all came later in the day. He was known to have a strong affinity for his fans and was known as a quiet guy. He was a big fan of the band Red and he always played with them as a fan.\nBerry wasn't just a fan, he went along with what was coming. He was always in an upbeat mood, and Berry would always hold a fan hostage at the bar, making their drinking out of control. He also liked to go hang with his sister, who'd been in rehab. Berry was also very close with Butterfield, who had also dated both singers. \"He had a very close group of band friends [which] would often be at the club, like me and Butterfield.\"\nBerry was more than happy to accept some of Berry's friendship, too. He once told Berry, \"There are things we really want to talk about here about yourself. And I think that's what you should give me.\" Berry said his wife had been in rehab since her breakup with Berry.\nTo be honest, when Berry and his band tried to get together for a \"live band\" set, which was still on hiatus, Butterfield said it wasn't his cup of tea. He liked to call it \"cuddle times.\" It's true that Berry's biggest fans came to believe that when they were at his house with him, \"I was spending more time with him than going to the bar.\" Berry didn't necessarily believe this, after all, he didn't come back in a year for a concert, so he never met with Butterfield on stage. With \"Can't You Hear my Voice\" and the rest of the new music that's made the album, Berry probably wouldn't have gotten his way with Butterfield. This was his biggest fan's moment yet.","token_len":580,"entropy":[5.3675,7.1625,3.7298,8.4603,6.4518,0.4778,1.2193,9.4481,0.3432,5.1846,3.8644,9.5239,4.6789,2.709,2.3338,9.6392,4.2509,6.4225,1.0075,1.2338,1.1364,1.7112,2.0139,4.2608,2.4908,0.5311,4.5954,0.4169,5.8413,7.4126,0.4294,9.4485,10.8234,3.9636,6.6136,4.5583,0.1229,1.138,0.0006,0.0082,3.327,3.3806,1.0871,0.4661,4.6661,4.7158,2.1347,3.9039,1.9909,0.0005,6.6782,1.8153,0.3295,0.0002,2.8576,0.6392,1.1702,3.726,0.0005,3.2206,1.4015,2.0556,4.8302,0.0002,1.5065,0.0861,0.9693,2.167,6.4456,1.456,0.0002,4.9254,1.2978,2.5295,2.9644,0.0002,4.8361,0.3954,0.0404,1.0546,5.1287,2.9004,1.1869,0.1676,3.8463,1.743,1.6794,0.7705,12.3992,3.4544,1.106,0.2011,2.8665,0.0002,1.9133,0.3696,0.0004,4.7298,2.5752,5.4414,0.7067,6.2202,2.6,1.5658,2.1318,0.0005,2.9211,3.5217,2.7258,3.5382,1.7401,8.2698,2.4459,1.203,0.8455,4.3097,4.3969,6.9471,2.5156,3.3923,2.2408,0.0003,4.6205,0.8368,7.0799,2.3218,2.2718,3.3996,1.9504,5.6491,7.16,6.6657,2.2649,4.1707,6.9958,0.7168,5.5959,1.4402,5.2636,0.0005,3.4339,2.9172,1.4389,5.0821,0.202,2.6519,0.0003,6.1746,1.1861,2.4667,0.9768,1.2486,0.2871,6.0726,0.371,2.8558,1.6424,2.9438,1.7549,2.333,4.5644,1.1599,6.9218,5.7609,1.2899,4.396,5.45,3.7016,1.6137,0.3734,3.1511,3.8268,3.1141,0.1835,1.3826,0.0004,3.7107,4.0694,1.079,2.9354,5.7388,0.5438,4.5547,5.8507,1.4656,6.1566,3.4769,2.7483,5.6094,1.7462,4.6938,2.8231,5.3977,1.1213,2.6257,1.2814,2.7945,3.4611,0.8743,1.7482,3.0859,5.938,5.2354,2.8645,0.5753,7.0023,1.8925,0.1573,0.0634,2.5533,6.1813,6.7838,1.4239,1.508,6.1484,2.8211,6.25,1.2998,0.7356,3.6487,0.3842,2.5954,2.4861,4.6372,1.5607,2.6024,1.616,4.4238,4.4296,0.2363,3.6751,5.1818,1.8337,2.8276,2.081,2.8784,0.9176,5.6632,1.8101,1.0701,1.7596,1.6216,2.2887,3.1184,0.6748,0.0346,2.0939,2.6674,5.8557,5.2226,6.5994,4.4789,3.5739,1.8214,0.7455,3.8563,1.0646,4.4564,0.5748,1.2348,2.392,6.0544,0.0019,4.2245,0.9241,1.8989,2.0337,0.9178,6.8148,3.4819,0.3291,5.0492,2.7475,4.1648,1.3466,1.5575,2.0899,4.2427,3.1303,5.4175,5.0018,0.0872,1.2665,1.8811,2.3581,3.3058,2.8055,4.9748,1.6674,5.704,6.2759,3.8571,1.9804,1.1271,2.2812,4.0658,5.7727,6.5139,7.7035,2.2527,3.9364,0.3142,2.2688,3.0101,4.4108,0.6551,4.1594,6.3205,5.0394,2.2582,5.8713,1.1297,1.9436,6.3632,1.1651,2.7965,3.4325,2.1311,1.6135,1.8487,2.1952,3.3413,3.1257,1.0736,3.2235,0.0024,0.6757,1.2793,2.346,3.3584,4.7793,5.7512,6.4587,0.7481,3.2937,2.0317,3.2631,1.0738,2.7724,2.4062,6.9695,0.2568,8.2146,2.6363,6.6192,5.7413,1.0625,3.4443,3.9078,2.3165,3.1258,1.0399,2.504,2.0707,3.7562,5.4736,1.2646,3.9616,0.0218,4.4113,0.5934,0.9665,1.8332,5.7817,1.5128,1.6087,0.1193,5.234,4.1782,0.615,2.4256,0.0172,6.6494,1.6432,4.7889,0.3087,1.6408,5.1575,1.9855,0.8003,0.8457,0.0384,4.5265,1.86,3.8281,3.2499,4.702,2.5698,0.2672,2.6892,0.0366,4.9321,6.3251,8.783,1.2254,3.2364,1.6111,1.963,1.7727,0.7566,1.5539,2.1652,2.0813,5.9459,2.592,1.6568,1.1774,3.2057,4.8027,5.5468,3.131,2.304,2.3708,1.3062,3.2163,3.3962,7.0258,1.1258,1.326,1.5117,1.5354,6.1622,3.5827,1.1081,0.0832,4.4763,0.9598,2.4788,3.211,1.3504,6.0593,0.1365,1.8893,1.9904,2.6362,0.9245,4.7015,5.8529,3.3925,1.2405,6.4986,0.6818,6.7614,1.7266,4.6793,3.4472,2.4964,0.6562,4.1349,0.0009,2.8537,3.7737,2.8015,0.0006,3.7061,6.0257,0.012,0.0187,0.3018,1.6045,5.4596,1.4886,5.6916,0.9566,1.3813,5.729,3.8728,4.8386,0.7116,3.8945,3.1612,2.9985,0.734,0.6482,2.7982,6.2184,2.2891,4.2882,2.6495,7.2614,0.8111,4.4044,1.7497,1.6792,3.69,3.4246,1.903,3.3704,1.7164,0.4432,4.0091,2.7591,1.3048,6.2597,3.1699,0.0925,0.2998,1.2954,0.6087,6.2711,0.5896,1.6294,2.1531,1.363,1.5503,3.6738,0.0007,5.3813,2.1328,2.5213,0.8275,7.1536,0.6609,0.35,1.6759,3.6191,0.0007,4.5512,2.538,4.2798,2.2827,2.6456,3.0137,1.1099,3.8259,2.5501,2.1923,1.1042,3.2212,4.366,2.9759,3.5961,0.0015,4.3447,2.3917,0.3233,6.8983,4.0099,2.1335,0.0003,0.0472,0.0052,4.9514,0.0023,1.8908,1.8185,2.5373,2.7314,0.1623,0.9347,4.0268,3.417,3.2816,4.1859,5.0627,2.7373,4.1456,0.8103,0.5913,6.5872,3.5374,0.0007,0.5231,3.4924,3.2764,3.315,2.018,1.9573,0.0011,0.8695,5.6939,1.7045,3.4945,3.5594,3.1124,4.6444,3.7144,4.8543,0.7885]}
{"id":3380,"ended":true,"length":516,"text":"Since 1962, Cooney had been producing talk shows and documentaries at educational television station WNDT, and in 1966 had won an Emmy for a documentary about poverty in America. In early 1966, the documentary, \u201cWhy the US Can Not Get a Grip on Poverty,\u201d was released on the National Geographic channel while a two-year-old-son, George, was out of high school. A later season of \u201cThe Talk,\u201d which ended with a special appearance by George for his father\u2019s birthday, brought Coney\u2019s talk into sharper focus, but the children of wealthy Southern families remained indifferent to his talk.\n\nIn the 1970s, Coney said, \u201cWe were the only good family here in America because everything else is done as though nothing happened to them.\u201d He recalled in his 1971 book, \u201cA Boy Without A Name: a Memoir of the Struggle for a Free Life in America,\u201d the children of wealthy Southern families in Florida had lost both jobs, which would have been more than enough. They also had no choice but to stay in the family home.\n\nWith a background in educational journalism, Coney and his colleague, Wanda Woldo, took a break from their daily news programs. Coney learned English, a language he\u2019d never been able to speak. When their day started falling apart, Coney wanted to speak at a public speaking event in Florida. To this day, he said, \u201cI\u2019m working for a college professor of Spanish. My wife is a teacher and I have to sit down and teach the students in between a program.\u201d\n\nConey went on to earn a reputation as a controversial talk talk talker in Florida.\n\nHe won first place for his first broadcast broadcast, \u201cThe Real Talk\u201d on June 18, 1971. He hosted a talk talk about poverty. When the show\u2019s host, Bill Winger, said his wife had been robbed by a car robbers\u2019 gun, Coney\u2019s wife replied, \u201cThey\u2019ll get that gun in the next 24 hours\u201d (Bills Winger says it took several days to get her gun); the station\u2019s business ran on being an anchor, and Winger couldn\u2019t believe it. But it eventually turned out to be a lucrative business and the station became a profitable TV news show.

{"id":3137,"ended":false,"length":483,"text":"Grasshoppers lay their eggs in pods in the ground near food plants, generally in the summer. The eggs in the pod are glued together with a froth in some species. After a while the pods are transferred to soil, where they grow in a flower bed.\n\nA species of woodchuck, the woodchuck is an attractive species for summer, the largest form of woodchuck (15\u201320 centimetres long). The woodchopper pods are often blue.\n\nIn North America, honeybeams, the honeybatten, are a class of honeybees that have also been described in European and African species. In Australia, honey beehives also use honeybeams (i.e. black bee(red)) in their nest boxes to nest in as early as October to November. In the Netherlands, honey has become a rare breed in the recent past with many honeybatten being sold as \"pods\". Bee-makers in many states have offered honey-by-the-nest boxes to those looking for hives to harvest in. The honey bees are known to have a strong affinity for fruit. Some form of honeybatten is used for honey dandelion, a type of honeybee. The bees enjoy being harvested from fields and flowers.\n\nA species of crows, the crows are a more difficult species to see, although they have been spotted before in New Zealand, the United States, New Zealand and Australia. In both countries the crows are known to use tracery, but also have been described in Canada and South America.\n\nA species of rattlebird or robin (Macroglas glasnii), a type of crow and the bony bird of the same name.\n\nThe common names of red and yellow hives and roppies are common to both the birds. These species are popular in the U.S. because they often look quite different when seen in the winter of the year. They are generally associated with spring, which is a time when they need flowers.\n\nHoney is a food for many mammals. Honeybees use honey to eat fruit which may be harvested for use in cooking, as well as to produce fresh foods through fruit fields.\n\nThe term honey is used in agriculture, and in many European countries honeybeams are used on dairy animals. However, honeybees do not use honey in agricultural products because they lack a distinctive color, which is an indication of their diet. In some parts of the world, in a country which can be seen as \"giant\" or \"low\" carbon, honeybeams are used to sell various foods including the use of honey.\n\nSee also\nBlack bee\nHoney mustard\nBones\nHoney\nHoney with leaf\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links","token_len":581,"entropy":[7.0236,3.8476,2.3283,11.2127,2.7612,0.5221,1.1616,9.5987,3.3573,1.1863,3.4005,4.2937,9.798,4.6967,1.7794,8.3681,2.3041,1.4389,2.7979,0.9339,2.2339,3.2381,6.2827,1.1507,2.2187,1.1184,9.9772,0.7397,2.6319,1.7774,10.2615,0.5059,4.1075,5.817,3.2018,1.7699,5.1488,2.153,2.8492,1.7711,1.8963,1.5195,5.9109,0.4014,4.6764,1.5734,1.0832,0.3298,3.3748,2.3996,2.2213,6.0026,4.0494,1.3345,1.8093,0.0033,3.7976,4.6307,0.442,5.6344,3.422,0.4463,2.0147,2.6353,2.9812,0.1507,0.2272,2.2612,2.9736,4.975,2.4273,1.6893,6.0809,3.6582,5.547,5.8069,6.6329,0.3776,1.5018,0.1012,0.3055,4.3019,7.19,3.8186,1.3243,6.0029,0.2628,0.0613,0.6333,1.2511,1.6547,1.2475,8.4502,0.3662,5.2718,0.7866,4.3061,6.4407,3.4245,1.6862,0.0002,3.5573,3.9747,0.0514,0.4405,7.8411,6.9151,8.5278,1.8215,3.2749,2.3653,4.1998,11.4745,0.8164,0.7358,3.0318,5.7338,0.1532,3.7855,2.2166,1.7879,2.9879,5.184,0.3852,2.8051,1.8536,4.5401,1.3582,3.6755,3.0486,0.6176,2.7227,4.8124,0.3507,2.164,6.6107,5.4116,0.0226,5.2437,5.2494,1.4884,1.8196,1.7811,3.671,5.8118,0.0013,0.0018,0.4495,5.294,4.1194,9.273,9.5019,2.8679,2.3776,1.146,3.4122,4.0373,3.3373,4.6638,1.5197,5.732,4.1069,0.0254,3.5655,3.9006,3.6984,0.5431,2.0884,1.7913,4.7324,0.2958,0.9944,9.3724,4.2554,0.9797,6.2586,4.9917,1.3007,1.3145,6.5168,0.2325,3.7237,3.5396,2.8006,4.216,3.9782,1.8921,4.0542,1.2043,2.1593,4.681,0.8543,1.3807,6.9454,3.8903,4.32,1.7648,3.8902,3.6051,1.2689,6.0179,2.2194,4.5766,6.6262,0.0398,2.6975,0.0101,2.8098,4.4009,3.4256,1.7923,3.9333,3.7794,0.5618,6.8621,0.032,2.8475,5.021,2.907,6.3978,2.8067,1.9362,3.3643,1.4547,3.7287,0.5728,2.8776,1.8554,4.1225,4.0126,0.2901,4.8081,2.0891,4.5002,6.9693,1.0077,1.2752,3.3963,1.705,1.5344,1.9907,1.9223,3.4509,7.4584,2.3606,0.9137,1.9396,3.6856,2.8974,0.0527,2.5546,1.1509,1.5843,2.6745,2.7361,6.5509,3.6909,5.7602,2.4406,6.0685,1.5182,4.4704,1.0069,1.0067,0.0002,3.1407,2.7032,0.0321,5.0354,2.593,0.5038,0.5451,0.735,0.0278,0.4118,1.5414,6.5895,4.2673,2.26,0.4918,3.3971,2.4406,3.3785,0.9931,2.3652,1.0621,4.1783,5.9484,1.6026,4.7999,0.423,1.3279,2.9947,1.653,0.3478,0.5511,4.181,0.1678,0.9392,1.8402,0.209,2.5782,5.4411,2.101,2.4191,1.0798,0.0025,0.7202,2.7846,0.2458,3.6571,7.1251,5.6375,1.1902,2.6128,4.2893,4.3635,3.3906,2.6229,4.309,1.0777,3.7148,1.239,2.7586,0.5903,0.3517,1.476,0.0002,1.7022,0.7927,0.0095,6.3432,4.6798,2.3785,6.0716,5.9824,0.2962,3.2106,6.0556,6.2393,8.8866,6.1159,6.0119,1.5199,3.6705,0.6337,2.6079,2.6156,0.0282,4.8565,4.6679,3.1994,6.5621,3.2314,2.5113,2.215,1.4411,3.474,0.4108,2.9472,1.7312,0.0002,2.6379,4.8742,4.9321,1.0584,6.1733,2.5301,2.0399,4.8944,0.1186,3.4169,4.8774,9.6533,1.2181,1.1426,4.7741,2.5054,2.3491,2.9208,4.0905,3.0024,3.9645,3.4298,0.861,6.1064,1.3332,1.7552,4.0325,0.0025,0.0525,0.7746,3.0642,0.9727,4.7223,3.8965,4.393,1.3846,4.3888,2.6129,1.6392,1.2468,4.1975,5.9253,1.2988,1.2712,0.4296,3.1156,0.7497,4.1288,5.2951,0.0177,4.5724,1.9978,3.3496,0.6781,2.7342,1.1736,0.5058,2.1806,5.1019,6.7032,1.6386,1.3732,0.0002,3.9842,0.5858,3.0433,1.6179,3.6738,1.6269,1.4911,3.8443,1.6532,3.5854,1.2628,3.8682,1.2876,1.382,5.0278,4.7757,5.6383,3.8724,0.9231,5.1291,3.0628,4.4363,0.3152,3.5191,1.7295,1.9105,0.6002,0.0036,1.4827,3.1239,6.198,3.9668,6.7226,5.2991,7.494,0.4407,1.843,0.0002,2.1822,3.6061,0.7398,3.5266,1.3024,1.8088,6.3279,2.5508,2.4257,2.4025,2.0072,3.9365,0.3023,3.4892,5.601,1.3498,0.6222,1.2162,4.8182,5.1724,5.5933,1.4056,4.0844,0.2274,2.2365,1.1216,2.1296,0.1586,1.8085,0.6266,2.1736,4.995,1.6985,3.1836,1.2886,4.9707,3.0542,6.2233,3.4307,2.8362,2.4966,1.0978,4.1023,1.3909,0.7434,1.9928,4.1827,0.4302,2.8286,2.6166,2.413,0.0118,0.4309,0.3393,0.7363,5.5733,4.7521,3.5732,4.1944,5.443,1.1053,4.3892,0.6965,4.2502,6.4937,2.6246,1.208,1.5304,0.3306,6.3724,2.3442,7.0851,0.9815,0.8588,3.5555,0.0706,0.6937,1.3534,1.8607,5.2536,6.5798,2.5365,3.5601,5.0676,6.5609,0.027,1.6119,1.9945,0.9043,0.0002,5.4666,0.4768,1.3917,24.822,2.9579,1.4411,18.0264,0.0356,8.269,0.5071,17.9156,4.9622,1.4651,17.8726,0.0237,3.0097,16.6754,0.0276,6.3162,8.2224,1.869,0.0013,5.532,0.7665,0.0008,6.5105,0.5137]}
{"id":2067,"ended":true,"length":528,"text":"From 1903 to 1906 Walpole studied history at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. While there he had his first work published, the critical essay `` Two < unk > Heroes ``, which was considered one of the best literary novels of the late nineteenth century, and was one of the most important books of his time, and is a collection of short prose poems, including one of the earliest ones, \"A New Way to Live,\" written in 1903. Walpole was the director of the Centre for American Writing for forty-eight years, and co-author of the best known novels of his time, ``One and a Half Gentle Man,\" and one of the best-known prose novels of his time, ``Journey from Mexico to America.\"\n\nWalpole also won and was a finalist for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1907 for his essay on his mother and three brothers \u2014 Elsie, Dorothy, and Ernesto. And yet in his final essay, Walpole did not hesitate to say, ``If I can do that, I will do it right, all right. That\u2019s all there is to that.``\n\nThe late writer was a pioneer in modern literature, and he would later work for several years in editing and publishing the work of his brother, Albert Walpole. Walpole is remembered by some for his contribution to contemporary literary theory. During his tenure as editor of ``American Writers,'' Walpole wrote, the work of J.J. Tipton and George Carlin is known worldwide. Walpole\u2019s essays -- also edited by Walter Benjamin, and edited by John C. C. Stokes and George Kline -- are considered the most important work of the 19th century. In the years after the publication of ``Journey from Mexico to America,'' Walpole edited such notable American and British writers as Henry James, Arthur Conan Doyle, Edward W. Norton and William Blake as well as others published about the author like Francis Bacon and the late Robert J. Heinlein.\n\nIn addition to his work, Walpole frequently contributed to the literature and politics of the 21st century. Like Benjamin and Stokes, Walpole also authored several literary works about American history, such as``A Brief History of the American Dream,'' ''Dollar General'' and ``New Perspectives.''\n\nWhat Are Books About?\n\nThere is a great deal of material focused on the United States in the 1950\u2019s, including those by a great deal of young people and the writers and critics of American American history.\n\nThe primary area of study in American history is how the American people became successful in the industrial revolution. It is important to study how the United States got its start in the industrial revolution, how the economy developed, the conditions under which manufacturers built factories and how the stock market changed in the mid-1940's.","token_len":581,"entropy":[12.2899,2.0725,3.4837,11.2748,2.2535,8.5286,4.5187,0.8707,10.7087,0.1634,1.5548,3.7957,1.0879,4.9186,1.4573,1.0532,4.4489,3.9804,0.8747,5.2121,1.7733,2.0547,3.1565,7.2343,3.1706,9.8554,13.1579,11.6249,9.1128,6.8414,6.5972,10.8642,6.0487,1.4729,1.2659,1.582,5.0263,2.6928,0.0145,0.1746,1.7299,5.1546,4.4049,0.4843,0.5337,4.851,0.72,0.071,2.395,0.9616,1.824,4.3678,0.0174,0.2759,1.3107,2.297,2.9573,0.7833,2.3648,0.7691,2.7458,2.0528,4.201,3.744,4.6882,0.0269,3.0287,5.5396,2.6061,2.1433,3.7136,2.6287,2.1119,1.1581,3.288,4.4245,1.4738,3.2102,3.1779,4.1003,4.5639,1.3968,2.3953,2.6198,2.2858,1.0551,3.8451,0.4744,2.6388,0.0,2.1008,3.325,5.4068,0.1095,0.688,6.2463,0.217,4.3763,5.8568,3.37,4.3357,1.0612,2.0197,0.0161,0.9277,1.0571,5.3779,0.0654,2.5944,0.5363,1.803,2.9533,2.8799,4.5482,0.6319,2.2574,0.4209,0.6372,1.7757,5.4025,5.2069,2.073,0.4086,8.6776,10.6055,2.1065,1.8216,6.3641,0.0731,0.2471,1.7326,1.7559,1.0475,5.3128,2.6011,0.3608,1.3786,0.3257,0.5229,0.255,5.6541,1.7456,3.8001,6.7632,0.4273,2.3943,2.8836,3.1982,0.0312,1.456,0.0002,3.8284,5.6591,7.1662,2.2404,2.4528,5.1107,0.0021,0.3939,0.5075,1.7159,0.2718,0.4264,0.2486,0.9309,3.5817,1.3517,0.8115,3.8781,2.5315,5.284,4.2682,2.9815,5.0242,1.9258,11.257,6.1089,3.1702,0.6678,5.2965,0.7397,0.1552,5.0718,3.2335,0.7504,6.3779,5.452,3.5061,2.302,3.3244,4.2533,0.9325,4.5485,0.0001,5.4959,0.3032,4.5347,0.1879,2.6264,1.688,0.5611,4.3737,1.4177,3.5548,2.7699,3.3977,0.5806,0.8733,1.6074,1.033,0.7225,6.2218,2.6259,6.527,0.5836,2.2477,3.8425,16.5816,8.1071,4.8346,2.9883,3.8967,0.0814,0.275,4.4327,1.5702,6.1906,1.0308,0.0003,2.9712,5.2164,4.772,2.9578,2.2027,4.218,0.6888,4.6986,2.0868,0.9693,1.1584,2.2916,4.3559,2.738,4.1958,2.5352,2.8537,3.191,2.0578,7.3407,1.5191,1.1258,2.8597,3.3577,0.1371,3.7635,4.1093,0.966,4.9548,2.3933,0.004,0.8691,3.7998,0.0006,3.739,3.3478,2.69,3.1733,2.0095,0.6023,4.6445,0.1516,4.7408,2.4457,2.3258,1.3794,5.9281,0.8197,4.1103,1.4559,0.7618,0.3672,5.2149,4.4412,4.6951,2.46,2.3265,0.0001,2.0328,2.8094,5.1175,3.3641,0.2554,6.2727,0.1156,4.8186,0.0353,6.2155,4.2441,0.1681,1.8689,4.8909,5.5267,0.0465,4.929,4.8192,5.2425,1.7535,3.0104,0.0005,13.6382,1.4734,4.5249,5.2603,7.927,5.4742,5.3434,0.3718,5.4504,4.9594,1.0502,3.6501,2.7602,0.1201,3.3328,3.7281,0.2621,4.9318,2.3915,4.7589,3.0039,1.8005,4.0127,4.4167,5.2595,1.4028,1.3174,2.8061,2.0198,1.7782,1.2013,1.663,0.4497,1.533,4.6631,0.0038,0.1196,0.6692,3.1394,2.3437,4.7708,2.0529,1.6575,1.3316,0.0205,1.3002,3.4399,0.0368,0.4588,0.031,0.0777,0.0114,0.3269,1.1267,0.0006,5.7167,6.038,6.2528,4.3077,3.393,1.8182,1.6936,0.0989,3.971,2.0192,0.3825,4.2754,1.8469,0.0024,0.0846,4.9529,5.0649,0.3984,8.2393,2.5372,2.7379,3.5222,3.4341,0.0275,0.0131,3.3899,7.3973,7.5485,0.7717,6.7397,7.8944,5.3794,0.6454,1.4469,3.9605,2.2343,4.1398,5.1138,0.024,3.4696,0.0012,0.2086,1.1744,0.0002,2.7336,2.7006,0.2048,1.0402,1.4654,2.9816,0.3172,0.0005,5.9264,3.351,0.4544,1.5026,4.3582,3.1197,3.773,0.0347,0.8328,5.9451,0.0059,0.0861,0.5781,6.265,3.7898,1.2373,0.7098,0.0024,0.2786,0.7826,0.0009,2.982,4.2841,2.8466,4.8086,1.3175,4.2488,3.6605,2.1907,0.9589,2.6622,0.0011,6.5553,3.0262,5.0492,0.2517,0.1012,0.852,1.812,5.4962,0.8439,3.3903,5.3805,7.6466,5.3773,2.1201,0.3263,0.3824,5.6493,5.5676,0.0006,2.4662,1.7898,0.0002,6.879,5.4305,5.5062,1.1297,0.5463,0.214,0.0001,3.7234,1.866,1.3438,2.863,0.3482,0.9283,5.1347,7.8594,0.1051,1.1472,4.7146,0.0019,2.1993,0.9037,5.079,12.5867,1.0012,0.3642,1.5792,2.0594,5.685,2.3769,5.5269,2.9583,3.0747,0.0109,5.8022,2.1064,2.9156,3.4736,4.5004,2.1496,3.5992,1.0401,3.6146,5.0823,1.4102,0.6066,2.3554,0.0001,2.0966,4.8417,5.5259,0.3229,2.5367,2.1889,2.0385,1.1571,0.5422,6.5853,1.2099,2.8457,1.4636,3.8369,5.9005,1.2715,1.2858,5.1613,1.6655,1.2131,3.5182,0.6093,2.1914,0.264,5.7543,2.2091,1.0732,2.3981,0.0018,4.108,1.7387,1.8244,1.2146,0.5329,1.9864,0.4661,1.2689,3.035,1.5061,4.0138,2.4537,0.8495,3.3118,5.0665,2.9914,0.0097,7.9335,3.6619,1.6992,1.3067,1.8738,1.308,7.582,0.9352,3.8135,2.7184,1.1417,4.071,0.0986,1.031,2.409,4.7926,0.2806]}

With all those upgrades, the front of the engine has become a significantly more powerful engine, which will be further enhanced by the introduction of a new piston design, which is designed specifically for the new cylinder and is available in most formas.\nWith its introduction, Ferrari will continue to create a competitive power unit and will also introduce a new engine design that can replace the original power unit.\nThe first change to this engine design is that it is replaced by an entirely new engine design.\nOn top of this, the design of the engines has been completely redesigned, with the addition of an all-new design.\nFor the first time, the new F1 design incorporates more power than previously, while also providing plenty of torque and a wider range of acceleration.\nThe first change to this engine design is that it is replaced by an entirely new engine design (Image credit: F1Team.com)\nAt 500 seconds, the new designs were able to increase the average speed in a single-speed gearbox, by over 10 per cent.\n\"We want to bring F1 back to a more compact race in the next decade, and I think we can do that without going too fast or too slow on the corners,\" said F1 boss Toressa Vettel.\n\"We know the value of the modern engines, and even if they are short in the short term, they still offer a lot of value at the end of the race, and while the changes are new, they are welcome.\"\nIn the sport, the most significant change for F1 is that the power unit will be fitted exclusively on all F1 drives, and will also come with a new cylinder

The storm has been strengthening slightly while the system remained offshore. National Hurricane Center said that Dorian was expected to arrive by Wednesday evening and will cross North America through the rest of the week due to increased pressure. The storm could become a tropical cyclone before the end of September.\nNuclear power companies have begun to switch back and forth between nuclear energy and offshore wind. Energy companies, as well as power companies, have also started reducing exposure to the impacts of Hurricane Dorian. However, as of Sunday morning, Hurricane Dorian is currently downgraded to a tropical cyclone. It is expected that as the hurricane develops, it will become a \u201chigh risk\u201d tropical cyclone.\nThe storm will cause maximum sustained winds to be 20 to 35 kilometers per hour. The storm will not damage any structures.\nThe National Weather Service in Florida has issued Hurricane Dorian Emergency Statement and Warning.\nThis hurricane will be a high risk high risk high hazard tropical cyclone. The storm will produce winds reaching 25 to 30 kmph. The storm could be located about 20 kilometers (14 miles) south-southwest of the city of Orlando, Florida.\nThis high risk tropical cyclone is a Category 4 storm.\nThe storm is expected to be located about 20 kilometers (14 miles) west of Orlando, Florida.\nFor additional information, click here.\nThe storm will cause maximum sustained winds to be 20 to 45 kmph.

{"id":2809,"ended":true,"length":543,"text":"Chakotay's inclusion in the main cast of Voyager was seen by critics as one of several who was used to highlight the diversity within the series. This was highlighted during the episode ``Gone With the Wind''.\n\nAccording to critics, the series was not \"fun, action packed, or any good''. Many of these complaints also stemmed from the fact that Voyager is an action-packed show, and being on top of this was the reason the cast was not included.\n\nChakotay admitted in an interview, \"I don't think our crew is trying to make Voyager good and I don't think there is any good reason for us to put it on the 'leather' (season) of Voyager.\"\n\nChakotay and his co-writer have been very critical to the show, making some of their criticism on the Voyager show a \"parody\" to the series. However, the pair have since revealed that the main cast was much the same as before -- with the exception that they both use different accents and accents in addition to being married.\n\nChakotay also admitted that he has a small part in Voyager and feels that Voyager was created to showcase Asian culture in general.\n\n\"As a big fan of the series and the creators of this series, I feel that it is a show that I enjoy... A show that has an Asian background. If it didn't have the Asian background, you wouldn't know about it and therefore why Voyager is known as known as 'Nigerian' show for many of the other Asian people' that we love watching,\" he said.\n\nThe duo, who have played a key part in the series since its inception, added that they were keen to \"give the fans the kind of show that you love, even if you don't know anything about anything\". The duo also highlighted that the episode is a \"very emotional\" one, and said that they cannot believe that the audience can relate to all of the characters for the first 10 minutes.\n\n\"I think we are very happy with that. We don't want to be too emotional. This episode is in the same vein which was originally intended for us to start with. We are definitely excited to introduce the episode.\"\n\nChakotay also commented that the episode ''wanted us to get an idea of what the characters were going to look like''.\n\n''For this episode, we wanted the show to have an amazing audience [so far]. For the audience to understand that there is a lot of drama that can be seen. This is a very emotional episode,'' he said.\n\nEarlier this week, Voyager Voyager released the episode which featured Captain Picard in various roles.\n\nThe episode also showed how Voyager had grown from a small pilot in 1977 to one of the largest TV series ever created.","token_len":582,"entropy":[6.8439,4.1611,1.2285,4.2535,8.4426,1.4678,0.6496,6.3714,2.5353,1.3509,7.3949,2.2906,4.8072,2.3639,3.044,0.4121,3.9685,0.0967,5.5717,6.6771,5.6664,7.0982,0.9194,6.8374,0.9274,4.969,4.108,0.3697,3.2714,0.6643,3.9251,1.7394,5.1793,3.3211,0.8659,4.1515,10.0428,4.6168,2.1548,1.5568,0.2052,0.0002,3.0515,0.8835,0.0017,4.7596,0.0036,5.239,0.2081,2.3179,3.5674,1.9603,3.1157,4.9923,4.8349,5.0031,6.8823,2.3513,1.2902,1.2684,5.1036,3.075,5.1061,5.3627,2.1817,3.0875,5.3029,5.3799,3.4991,0.02,0.82,0.6769,0.0373,1.5997,2.9309,3.5344,2.7401,1.4685,0.5287,1.4419,1.2396,1.6595,6.2666,4.4197,4.3536,0.0388,4.4169,2.7787,3.6992,3.4664,2.9157,3.3131,1.8244,2.1309,1.4386,1.1119,1.3097,0.0003,6.7585,0.0364,0.0158,0.0011,7.8418,2.3898,1.5497,0.0809,4.0363,0.752,1.0754,2.6917,0.0012,1.1562,5.724,4.7347,1.6442,5.2491,0.117,2.5654,3.6183,5.4965,4.7155,2.9888,0.8823,0.0007,0.0803,3.2377,1.5675,1.343,4.1022,1.0417,1.1081,1.897,1.0548,4.6603,3.9916,1.0171,1.4415,5.4809,8.1013,4.3659,2.809,5.0249,3.6598,2.3099,3.8108,2.236,1.4089,0.7403,0.0003,3.3755,0.0094,0.0072,0.0005,4.4971,2.7728,2.3324,0.0425,2.6735,6.2348,2.0736,4.3763,2.2973,5.9891,1.2364,1.4411,1.4554,5.0084,3.7313,0.9827,1.8878,3.5943,4.0823,1.0371,5.7961,4.0722,2.854,4.7593,6.0818,0.8634,1.457,2.7357,0.9574,2.7176,0.9547,3.2038,0.044,2.778,6.179,1.6312,3.7896,5.3789,0.5753,2.764,4.5471,1.4455,2.5868,5.7448,6.2845,0.017,1.1558,2.3357,6.1916,3.4478,3.5157,0.4047,2.8874,2.5055,3.3909,5.7613,3.1603,3.8565,2.0422,3.7858,2.5899,5.2233,0.0059,3.4891,6.9674,0.851,0.4858,0.0003,2.3322,0.0055,0.0087,0.0006,2.1004,2.9388,0.6461,1.3612,3.1133,2.2579,5.1869,4.0386,0.3978,2.833,3.5545,5.4626,0.7389,2.6539,3.1949,3.6995,1.4373,4.9682,6.8622,2.6367,2.3842,2.7305,0.7283,1.172,0.0002,2.5668,4.6627,1.2388,4.9356,0.7525,0.1346,1.9489,2.6821,1.9995,3.4749,5.994,1.2256,3.0295,2.1246,0.3269,0.2964,2.4916,1.1635,2.4119,1.5239,2.0067,3.7724,0.5924,2.4551,4.5511,6.7123,5.9638,0.7551,0.2989,2.8367,3.4835,0.5729,2.9477,1.7468,4.7289,2.5893,4.2506,0.0012,0.6505,3.2072,1.5124,1.9438,0.5256,3.7348,1.4153,0.0011,2.2116,3.0248,0.6042,3.7166,6.7094,5.4432,5.4681,1.1356,6.4581,0.7424,9.7219,0.4315,1.923,5.701,8.681,0.5104,1.6211,6.683,5.0892,4.0864,3.1201,1.4548,4.6391,1.3798,3.2776,8.671,4.3912,2.4576,4.284,5.2781,3.0809,0.8017,0.6031,0.223,0.3587,0.0002,2.922,4.3737,4.0297,0.5641,1.6742,4.9835,2.7587,4.3808,2.5591,0.0862,0.7164,1.8692,1.9924,1.1263,1.1163,0.2221,4.0639,0.4385,0.8877,2.4494,6.2441,0.199,3.7806,4.5918,2.1861,1.9505,2.4344,5.556,0.1359,3.7092,0.6999,4.1868,3.1178,2.135,4.3503,0.3289,1.4353,0.9663,0.0016,2.2033,2.911,0.0695,5.3015,3.5984,4.6563,2.0767,1.1095,5.9359,1.2102,1.654,4.501,3.2625,2.4098,1.9652,2.9694,3.7613,2.0989,0.9357,0.9671,1.6031,2.8951,0.4902,1.6077,7.2517,5.3462,0.7693,1.7618,4.0194,3.8374,3.9078,0.1567,4.2601,0.9778,0.5572,0.7457,5.6776,1.9553,1.2375,3.834,0.879,0.9567,0.3076,0.0002,1.8797,1.9601,1.3066,2.2375,2.091,2.0209,2.1411,1.273,3.0543,1.7282,1.4002,3.4951,0.0009,1.6738,0.4377,2.621,3.3878,3.2462,1.6946,4.1343,2.5519,0.7439,6.2486,1.8941,3.3779,1.2484,6.5127,2.7267,5.4314,2.1998,1.6617,2.821,2.0694,5.6148,1.7878,1.3906,1.3374,2.0523,5.7545,3.3128,1.5851,4.8402,1.7791,7.1584,4.5213,0.3696,0.0002,2.0574,0.0096,0.0046,0.0005,1.5879,3.3647,0.9152,1.4969,2.3892,5.708,6.1851,2.7277,3.1231,0.0544,3.0904,4.981,3.1443,0.3874,0.7503,1.6538,2.3549,2.4043,2.1365,0.5526,2.2508,0.0048,2.5147,0.9685,0.0002,4.9751,4.7371,3.5239,0.4142,0.7137,0.5878,1.8033,2.5024,3.0321,0.0492,2.1276,1.5767,6.0939,5.9721,7.0385,4.9822,5.8023,1.2092,4.2947,1.6457,3.5521,1.4042,3.1121,1.7969,2.5216,1.1449,0.953,1.9424,0.4784,4.5025,3.3989,3.4706,1.6911,3.8989,2.6012,3.2525,1.1356,1.4455,1.8268,1.2084,0.2714,3.7516,0.1723,0.3604,0.0962,0.2353,0.0002,5.9636,0.4615,2.0767,0.193,3.153,6.1455,3.7283,2.2254,3.8798,5.2194,2.5324,5.2683,3.863,3.2301,5.8996,1.5402,1.1254,1.2782,0.0002,2.1876,0.8257,2.8114,5.5838,3.2759,2.8729,4.0518,4.6727,2.1617,0.9294,1.8719,4.6014,2.7885,4.7627,0.4198,3.1479,0.2822,0.2171,2.5725,2.8649,0.5971,1.7255,1.5487,0.5569]}
{"id":4743,"ended":true,"length":536,"text":"Difficult conditions greeted the teams upon their arrival at the Silverstone Circuit, as parts of the Midlands received a month's rainfall in the space of two days. The torrential rain lasted throughout the day, on the pitch between the first and second pit stops resulting into serious damage to the vehicle and wreaking havoc in the technical circuits throughout the whole of the day including the track leading towards the Circuit de la Francais (Sainte-Coburgier Circuit). The total damage totaled \u20ac21.1 million and \u20ac7.2 million are still expected.\nThe official driver's reaction to the situation\nFor some, Friday morning was simply a blur as only two pit stops were allowed for the day and the car was kept parked on the track where it was not only a pain to navigate on to the track as it was difficult to make it at the proper turn at a speed of less than 80 mph. \"We'll get it out of our heads but I don't think the conditions are going to be very ideal or even tolerable,\" Ousmane Ousmane, who signed his third pole position championship of the season, told reporters after the start.\nOusmane added further to the woes caused by the long day, stating that it was only fitting that the first pit stops were allowed, allowing for the possible closure as well as more difficult conditions. \"Because it was a long day it didn't really make the whole thing feel any better,\" he said.\nOusmane was also quite happy with last season's pole for Frenchman Pierre Piquet and confirmed that the driver needed to make some adjustments at the beginning of the season and after completing the lap in the right conditions to get back to the podium position. \"I'm very happy with that,\" he told reporters after the race, \"in a sense, it's a good first time, and it means I'm really happy with how the session went.\"\nTeam owner, Jean-Michael Reichert, praised the race and commented that it was a great test for the Belgian driver, but questioned his position to do so. \"I think Pierre Piquet deserved to get it. In general he needs three points to start at the front. Now we're looking through the data, so it's clear that he needs to change his strategy. We're going to have an opinion from the team tomorrow. But with Pierre Piquet and the performance we're having, it sounds like there's a chance [for him to finish seventh] if he makes a good effort in a good night's sleep.\"\nWith the victory, team owner Jean-Michael Reichert secured a fourth place. In the opening laps the Dane held off the field to reach the fifth slot, making for an interesting night in the middle of it all with two more races remaining until Monday's scheduled start.","token_len":583,"entropy":[8.7622,7.8329,11.5499,1.6226,6.6814,7.7706,1.3893,0.3579,1.5674,1.0628,7.1144,0.5238,3.9005,1.6988,3.4357,8.6961,0.06,0.3859,10.2467,6.5892,2.2917,8.2189,1.2709,5.0153,2.7956,1.2549,7.5191,0.0016,2.2025,0.7509,0.4388,2.9844,6.6217,0.0684,0.7392,5.0415,6.0001,0.2391,0.6442,0.8004,5.8841,1.9458,7.4977,5.4647,1.4986,5.2012,0.6027,0.2888,5.1158,0.2682,10.8271,9.2952,6.3899,2.428,0.8917,0.9322,6.2813,1.6942,8.2372,0.7441,0.2716,2.9399,0.4214,6.5998,5.6546,5.8947,0.2283,6.0212,1.3181,0.1679,1.746,6.9054,0.933,3.9433,6.9182,3.7268,0.4326,3.6499,1.8085,1.7248,7.0,2.3348,4.7553,4.8923,3.9437,0.0144,0.1951,1.6669,4.7237,4.0464,7.8308,3.4591,0.3867,2.4653,6.8067,1.6718,6.7328,2.9684,5.1843,1.5543,3.3926,0.7154,2.3375,5.4326,3.8042,0.2784,2.3634,0.0198,5.0191,2.8705,4.7684,2.4243,0.4561,7.2036,6.1701,6.411,1.5746,7.1558,0.8861,0.2392,3.3464,4.3268,5.7791,4.4939,1.8677,8.1444,3.4083,1.1694,4.2729,0.7307,6.1714,3.3643,6.0509,2.7879,4.2972,0.2785,0.9598,3.4643,2.8614,0.7437,2.7185,2.5397,1.5947,5.1362,1.2521,5.3344,4.148,2.304,0.3893,1.7047,5.3535,0.7835,1.2564,2.8505,4.9427,3.3054,4.5105,1.4952,5.5732,3.8185,5.7535,0.5349,1.2151,5.2241,1.3596,0.8131,4.0292,0.2426,3.9887,2.1427,6.4384,0.8458,6.7355,4.4977,4.3657,3.6033,3.8276,1.0026,4.086,0.0023,3.7549,2.9372,0.8329,4.1975,2.5176,6.0656,3.5407,3.1909,2.8209,0.5725,3.2883,0.9176,3.2824,2.3775,1.7808,0.0008,0.8913,2.954,3.7513,1.3898,2.4589,0.0397,0.6174,3.2598,5.6957,5.1332,3.3254,5.1637,0.0016,1.0713,7.3763,6.8079,0.3514,0.1632,7.9216,4.884,0.2532,0.1342,1.1448,2.6916,6.1687,3.8153,5.2107,6.019,0.8937,8.7129,5.2216,0.6028,0.5038,1.6134,0.8461,4.27,1.6502,0.7882,3.2003,1.481,1.0525,2.6115,0.1579,0.0027,0.0011,3.0576,7.6844,3.2625,0.6818,3.8051,4.1477,0.0529,0.4222,6.0616,2.4639,2.2255,2.8496,0.8296,2.9899,0.5622,3.5059,4.3231,0.628,1.062,4.1626,1.0928,3.0963,0.8052,1.0197,3.2776,5.6962,2.0431,1.4194,6.8866,4.8492,6.6249,3.098,0.1972,4.8841,4.837,1.0839,1.5209,0.7439,6.047,2.7022,1.0267,1.7947,2.2996,0.2198,2.6797,3.8278,0.0004,2.3393,2.8848,3.8531,3.5609,1.9763,3.7885,2.6609,0.4719,1.3557,0.4561,0.6179,0.2187,1.0946,2.0607,0.0663,0.003,0.0017,3.2842,2.3446,5.0334,2.2172,1.0239,6.8307,2.8564,0.2222,4.5891,6.8943,8.0228,4.3064,4.2521,1.6725,0.1123,3.5353,3.9081,0.3803,1.4006,4.6875,6.3261,0.6113,3.5016,2.2569,1.344,4.223,0.4874,2.9565,0.14,0.212,1.1112,3.3355,4.8328,5.0737,1.2047,5.4403,2.4911,1.3327,6.9123,2.1517,2.6508,2.8017,1.9078,1.6605,0.7107,2.8278,4.4607,0.6412,0.7182,1.4164,2.0002,1.896,0.308,0.6659,3.3824,1.5561,0.4223,2.9693,2.1765,1.337,0.6421,1.6569,2.6839,1.7256,4.9373,3.0242,3.8438,2.2585,1.512,0.9406,1.6994,2.0343,5.6228,4.2355,2.6169,2.8661,1.884,4.2955,3.0813,1.0114,4.1633,1.0732,0.9372,2.775,2.1166,6.14,0.8021,1.9003,0.5223,5.5545,4.3174,3.6622,4.049,0.5008,6.8097,5.2526,4.4654,1.5052,0.006,0.7845,5.4264,0.5576,4.1907,1.8278,4.1793,0.9294,2.119,0.7473,0.9879,1.8176,3.7418,0.7705,0.648,6.3635,2.0787,1.6524,3.9546,5.5556,2.8532,4.3606,4.2431,5.4446,0.9977,1.334,0.2331,1.3885,1.388,3.9285,1.294,0.0078,0.0024,3.8758,1.5413,3.3403,4.9903,4.2709,4.2163,4.9185,2.5228,4.7595,7.0719,2.4318,2.0189,5.4376,3.9328,0.5955,3.0749,2.7267,5.4585,2.0266,2.0786,2.8006,6.8937,0.9334,3.5087,2.4579,3.7587,1.9801,0.4866,4.8104,0.7306,0.9344,2.3649,0.8221,4.7557,0.8122,2.7398,1.9357,2.3942,1.8135,3.1895,0.2728,2.0855,5.1217,5.7624,3.3804,0.8526,2.8241,3.3895,2.0875,2.9897,4.8258,4.093,0.6494,0.0049,0.0027,2.7075,2.0403,5.1975,3.0987,1.8076,3.6533,1.3119,1.5986,7.8188,0.3174,3.2521,0.6903,1.1996,3.0855,6.3998,2.1861,0.9453,0.1322,3.4937,4.8719,1.7634,4.0933,0.7789,4.0752,1.9674,1.9232,2.9474,3.087,4.5703,2.4883,8.9604,1.3425,3.9306,1.1548,0.4913,4.0092,1.2997,5.3565,1.5262,5.2411,1.126,1.948,0.0496,2.3569,0.0253,0.0021,0.0008,0.002,7.4842,1.4737,2.822,1.6347,5.0034,4.1569,1.3791,4.9793,3.3183,2.8538,7.1799,5.0811,2.6696,1.4583,5.3493,2.9508,5.5843,0.6668,5.1081,7.1592,1.3746,5.0522,4.5569,2.2117,3.2303,4.2983,3.0181,0.6545,5.3986,0.3616,6.6235,0.7339,3.3983,3.9202,3.8982,3.1079,2.2177,3.5816,4.7161,1.939,6.6638,2.9315,1.4905]}
{"id":1557,"ended":false,"length":536,"text":"The Reds were the NL champions in 1961, and with the addition of Sisler, Dave Hillman, and Moe < unk > to ensure stability to their pitching staff in 1962, the Reds have been on the move since then. They have been a winning teams club in each of the last two seasons, winning the World Series two years in a row, including the 1963 ALDS win over the Indians. A lot of the offense, defense and runs were lost in 1963 with a combination of the injuries to Homer and Anderson, plus the loss of the young starter.\n\nThe Reds haven\u2019t won five of six, but they have won four of six since 1971. They also haven\u2019t won the World Series since the mid-1960s in favor of. In 1963 they only won the AL Championship as a whole, but they were at.200\/.254\/.292 during the year, but a win in the National League means that they\u2019re in the NL Championship Game (and that is in 1963), and have a chance at a fifth consecutive World Series appearance. They also won the Cy Young Award in 1971 with a 2.63 ERA, a tie for fifth among all AL starters and one of only two teams (Seattle\u2019s, Kansas City\u2019s, and the Giants\u2019, respectively) to earn a World Series ring. They were the only team to receive a Cy Young Award in 1974, although the recipient was Barry Bonds in 1976. To this date, Reds history is still marked with a lot of losses, but also many of the same good times. Since 1993, the Reds haven\u2019t lost five of six (including the 1967 ALDS win against the Astros), despite having a season end the way they didn\u2019t win.\n\nThe Reds won\u2019t miss too many games, as they will compete to land the NL pennant next year. While there are no postseason games for the Reds, they\u2019ll be out to keep pushing through the NL Championship Game, which will be held in Orlando on September 24, and the Cardinals will be in the NL Division Series as well. On November 10, the Reds open the regular season on a 1-0 lead over the Giants, who will be playing the Cubs.\n\nThe Reds won\u2019t miss losing and keeping up with the NL. If they\u2019re not happy with the direction they\u2019ve headed, they\u2019ll probably be the ones to pull the trigger or move on. They\u2019re very, very unlikely in a championship era to be seen as the last team to win the World Series. With so much history to lose here, there\u2019s no reason to believe that the Reds won\u2019t be the top franchise in baseball for a long time to come.\n\nFollow @SislerMoe","token_len":583,"entropy":[10.8538,3.4485,3.5096,7.9451,4.7777,1.2058,5.4418,1.0007,1.8161,5.5894,1.7527,3.7975,0.0022,7.711,4.9765,3.1732,1.0114,8.0355,6.7098,4.5553,1.3766,1.0093,8.9637,11.514,10.5924,4.5376,6.4835,4.3087,9.2469,6.7096,5.161,1.7133,3.3318,0.084,3.9009,2.5763,0.4367,0.8923,0.6525,5.0137,1.7811,3.7079,1.184,4.2908,2.1605,2.0758,0.3006,3.1069,1.7167,2.4168,3.0019,5.4768,7.582,7.9246,1.6433,4.1893,0.0822,0.4689,0.6026,1.2735,0.9416,0.6496,1.7664,1.4735,3.2436,0.0243,4.9804,1.0874,0.791,0.0135,0.0,1.3038,4.9583,1.3745,5.2376,3.1622,1.4834,5.3841,0.6976,0.3074,3.8926,0.7616,4.4615,4.3513,0.5065,2.0404,6.3842,3.1536,2.2055,2.1026,7.231,2.5907,3.8285,1.2911,4.036,3.8199,3.5475,3.9757,0.0108,2.7479,5.5469,1.337,6.5642,2.887,7.3534,0.9668,5.0034,1.0028,3.8251,0.0555,3.4756,4.9308,5.4968,3.5423,2.6836,0.0194,1.7076,0.908,5.899,15.5041,7.8268,0.52,3.1337,5.149,2.2948,3.0947,2.5714,1.3369,0.838,0.9665,1.2128,2.4956,0.5388,1.4558,3.448,4.832,0.7739,1.3673,3.403,3.5537,0.1847,0.091,0.0475,0.6335,2.9763,2.2336,0.0183,1.2864,3.8351,4.5453,0.2964,2.0611,0.0838,4.2947,8.8322,0.0032,8.3399,3.3575,3.4973,3.095,5.104,0.6816,1.4419,1.4922,2.5053,5.2833,1.2682,5.0739,0.7302,1.2319,1.0893,2.2605,5.2399,7.8411,13.9629,5.0915,5.6833,0.0405,6.1595,3.958,1.5099,2.9184,1.4826,3.1403,5.1578,3.9858,1.5931,1.3078,3.6305,0.1245,9.297,1.9265,0.7022,8.7716,0.8383,2.0944,2.5564,0.8854,3.01,4.3666,2.7249,4.5677,3.2812,3.4425,1.6565,4.1993,4.0627,2.4593,1.4235,4.6436,2.7327,0.954,2.5019,2.3997,6.2558,1.5774,1.7251,0.0177,1.6915,0.5329,2.325,2.4094,2.2473,0.5274,5.5554,0.0091,1.2411,0.814,3.7592,4.0825,1.6185,3.3596,0.7604,4.9486,0.0747,1.2662,3.5293,6.3348,0.6507,2.9472,2.9934,2.2343,2.1109,2.4755,2.2888,3.7498,0.907,1.4567,1.3928,1.9752,4.5928,6.6879,10.9208,0.3505,0.5175,3.1628,4.9166,0.0884,0.8664,0.057,0.0647,1.1944,1.1253,2.3549,4.5524,2.1683,0.0287,8.1705,4.217,0.0865,0.551,5.0042,1.9022,3.0256,0.0091,1.4966,0.6481,2.1727,2.6638,1.791,1.5046,0.5292,0.6495,6.5965,1.22,1.8769,0.0836,0.8345,0.958,4.0771,1.1087,5.1782,1.8412,7.4326,0.9837,5.6507,0.1337,3.0983,3.6462,0.3982,6.3429,3.8746,3.203,0.3801,5.3969,4.1984,1.6505,3.8965,6.4187,1.5066,2.125,5.1477,0.0485,5.2406,0.9987,1.2387,5.7375,3.0017,4.4301,0.9168,4.3667,4.9297,4.7678,1.2588,5.8235,5.016,0.3686,0.7825,0.3318,5.0085,0.0395,0.1705,0.0086,1.2896,3.0986,0.7983,0.7417,3.5885,2.408,1.2275,5.3209,1.4021,0.5225,2.1598,3.3045,0.2961,4.6986,1.3115,6.3055,2.93,2.5872,6.3197,10.4387,5.1716,5.8094,1.2256,6.5143,0.2078,0.1536,0.172,2.008,4.3656,1.5895,0.0003,1.6002,1.0063,3.6905,5.0419,0.1646,0.7792,6.6773,8.432,0.2951,1.125,1.9574,3.5427,0.7562,4.6514,6.4449,3.4972,6.0446,1.5337,2.194,3.5178,0.0135,3.0027,0.5577,0.6193,4.8114,3.6171,1.2504,2.9173,5.7509,1.7402,2.9839,0.6842,0.264,0.7903,0.7931,5.966,0.1334,0.5523,1.4392,4.8181,3.0818,6.1637,7.9212,2.9396,0.686,2.4136,4.14,1.583,1.9857,2.1006,2.0886,0.6817,1.4875,1.044,5.6986,2.4263,2.6657,3.4045,1.1873,2.3522,2.0029,6.1564,1.4923,1.4982,2.428,2.1709,3.499,2.4491,0.4926,4.4989,0.3302,0.3557,5.09,3.9184,3.5045,0.3786,0.9125,0.2704,6.9527,0.7769,2.6242,0.0082,2.5294,2.2827,4.862,0.0618,0.4328,2.7341,2.2774,0.1126,3.9757,1.1513,1.1304,1.4477,1.513,1.824,1.0591,3.6336,1.6904,1.9231,0.0003,1.5235,0.6602,3.3182,0.587,0.0362,0.0041,0.9591,9.3252,5.3986,7.0408,2.7749,0.887,0.3698,3.6488,3.1356,5.2191,0.9423,4.0536,0.0636,0.5331,3.5964,5.7975,0.6377,1.1384,6.0697,1.6805,4.5346,0.043,1.374,4.3979,0.8126,0.8087,1.8128,0.1681,0.4562,4.4433,3.1357,4.5207,2.8193,0.7134,4.6018,1.4676,0.217,5.392,4.7156,0.8941,0.6286,2.5185,2.8049,0.0863,4.6788,5.0242,3.4354,0.0165,5.6668,5.1546,2.7511,5.3342,5.633,2.5655,2.6848,6.69,1.1247,2.1873,4.0016,0.835,0.699,1.9034,1.8874,1.4068,0.0224,0.8532,4.7011,3.5431,1.8459,2.6252,2.1715,4.2074,6.2281,0.3733,3.3266,1.8115,0.1587,0.3904,1.9603,1.6662,0.8084,2.4175,0.6192,1.1971,0.4492,2.3861,1.6528,0.0333,0.004,1.9984,2.2244,8.0309,5.3984,0.8411,1.3739,2.7662,1.8485,0.9529,0.1022,1.2398,0.0017,0.1798,1.1761,0.0004,5.2285,1.542,4.0845,3.9912,0.1356,4.2653,5.3131]}
{"id":966,"ended":true,"length":491,"text":"Federer started his season at the Brisbane International. He defeated Milos Raonic in the final, thereby becoming only the third man in the Open Era to have 1000 or more wins, joining Roger Federer, Boris Becker and Arthur Ashe.\n\nThe 28-year-old, who has won his last 4 matches while a two time runner-up, had another solid start to their career. Federer defeated No 1-seeded Stan Wawrinka in the third round on Friday to move to a record-extending 18th win at this round.\n\nThe Russian has held a two and five-set lead over unseeded Wawrinka in two years.\n\nWawrinka had never held serve at that time, and has won it only once in his previous seven attempts at the tournament.\n\nFederer\u2019s success with a third consecutive tournament win followed with the surprise win at the Australian Open.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve waited too long and that is unacceptable in our system. It\u2019s very difficult to fight in any other tournament because you have to have a winning percentage in each matchup where you have a good chance to win the game. We must be extremely careful here and it\u2019s very difficult without playing like we know we can win the match,\u201d he said in a release.\n\n\u201cI would not like to miss this important match. I am not happy to drop any one game out of this competition... I want to give this team a lot of chance to win this tournament.\u201d\n\nFederer, however, had to settle for a 2-3, 6-2 defeat by Milos Raonic in the match that has brought the two of them to their last meeting in Melbourne.\n\nHaving won three of his last four singles matches, Federer faced some of his best competitors at a major championship.\n\nThat could put Federer in position to return against the 22-year-old Serbian on Sunday for the first time in three tries at a major title.\n\nFor the first time, Federer is tied for first in the Open Era with 19 wins, tied with Rafa Nadal who also broke down the barriers.\n\n\u201cI\u2018m happy to go back in the same way and finish what I started,\u201d Federer told reporters after facing Raonic in the round of 28 at the Brisbane International.\n\nHe said he will return to serve at an All England Club match after he is forced to withdraw from the tournament due to an ankle problem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate. With tennis for 18 years and here I am trying to win this tournament and I am happy to play with the guys that we have here... It\u2019s a great feeling coming back in Melbourne,\u201d Federer said.","token_len":583,"entropy":[9.9169,6.9606,2.6491,4.3892,2.0576,1.9504,8.4666,7.6751,2.7535,1.7974,8.1066,7.1362,0.357,0.7906,0.002,1.8019,0.7445,2.1703,2.1403,8.3612,2.8815,4.4232,0.0288,1.5221,4.7085,1.0756,1.3911,7.7557,3.6488,0.369,2.7659,9.8206,3.4199,0.0693,2.7213,2.7845,2.9821,3.5139,0.0581,0.0001,1.8318,6.1414,0.0142,0.9347,6.0726,0.4285,0.4224,0.7889,0.0004,2.5809,7.2621,0.1847,0.0415,0.1836,0.0011,3.6083,0.2585,2.0144,1.7808,3.9115,1.8685,5.6526,3.3248,6.1031,5.4419,5.9866,4.1737,6.7176,0.2957,0.0027,1.1666,3.3498,4.958,3.8521,2.8148,0.9208,7.1955,3.0645,2.0064,4.9964,0.0035,3.7301,6.3512,5.3361,2.817,6.0349,0.0399,6.2584,0.1841,0.0008,0.0003,0.0,0.8616,0.5463,4.3294,0.1358,3.0619,3.4325,2.9746,3.6445,1.9684,3.7372,5.23,4.5032,9.8559,0.2091,6.5983,0.729,3.7313,3.0308,5.0609,5.8896,0.979,0.8415,0.0002,2.1269,5.1377,2.9989,4.8667,2.3647,4.2504,6.5271,7.6444,1.7955,1.9213,1.9166,1.2602,10.2524,0.0169,3.9921,0.0077,0.0056,0.0005,1.3587,5.5183,3.8921,1.7927,1.3157,0.0002,3.2491,0.0205,0.0054,0.0005,3.3011,5.2636,3.1757,12.0608,1.8056,5.9629,3.4763,1.0421,2.1482,2.9248,3.0986,4.671,4.2147,0.3601,1.7186,0.5096,4.4427,4.12,5.4028,2.4118,1.1589,3.7174,0.2193,0.6585,0.0002,2.7776,0.0022,16.0711,8.771,3.9156,5.407,3.9126,2.9003,6.0052,2.2341,4.8328,3.1738,5.1123,4.9236,2.6089,6.6637,1.5797,1.8074,1.0596,2.8292,0.0172,2.1458,0.726,0.0001,5.1687,4.7281,7.6838,11.2039,5.6755,3.6227,5.1981,3.0436,0.0474,3.793,5.3605,1.65,6.026,3.8826,2.4527,6.0337,1.0105,3.0939,1.7175,1.746,0.0351,5.0504,2.5144,0.7607,6.4521,3.7567,4.3052,2.9867,3.0686,4.1001,1.9001,1.1114,0.3449,2.9361,1.2541,3.1567,4.4622,2.925,3.7529,5.7138,4.858,0.4709,1.2138,1.7902,2.9577,1.4786,1.5257,0.4393,2.8253,2.0848,0.4131,2.1939,4.5787,2.7502,5.2403,1.7529,3.9806,1.9433,3.5754,1.6005,0.113,0.0047,1.8171,1.1122,7.8277,4.3607,4.2465,2.3029,4.6464,1.9311,1.2629,1.0545,2.1947,2.4847,2.9891,9.5502,8.8843,6.2313,0.9881,3.0441,0.7445,5.1652,0.3027,0.1903,0.0002,1.4633,0.4371,2.3388,3.5548,2.879,3.2893,0.1896,4.8772,1.4357,5.8499,2.3517,1.544,1.403,2.7734,3.3472,3.4613,3.1638,7.0364,4.6218,5.8492,3.0156,4.8889,0.4979,1.4695,4.3018,6.5528,1.9899,2.3563,0.2134,4.2372,2.6707,2.837,1.207,3.253,0.1845,5.9934,1.057,0.8424,2.7062,1.2926,0.7571,4.6274,1.6954,0.7381,0.0002,2.5862,0.0017,3.1668,4.3178,0.0076,3.5238,2.6454,2.6505,0.0929,1.0581,4.4224,0.2348,2.4614,4.9866,3.7546,0.2559,2.9504,2.8037,3.7949,5.213,0.0005,0.0503,0.0005,1.4507,0.4975,6.5332,3.007,4.3713,3.8469,2.216,3.7343,3.2488,0.0533,1.6488,3.6875,5.3819,4.1344,2.1002,3.7885,0.6661,0.3283,0.0002,6.7272,2.1071,2.7204,1.299,1.7682,0.3406,0.3906,5.425,0.7429,0.6477,1.3277,0.0008,5.7631,5.4805,2.1374,1.8048,1.5425,3.679,2.3765,3.964,3.9022,5.0293,1.7897,0.4762,0.0002,5.8231,4.7794,5.2601,5.0679,0.0007,1.1604,4.0327,0.263,4.6325,6.2011,1.9971,7.688,0.078,0.0883,0.0281,0.0014,5.783,2.907,1.8691,4.1444,1.2216,1.6352,0.1516,1.9352,3.287,5.3521,1.8038,2.9421,0.2541,2.0293,0.5982,0.2108,0.0002,5.3085,1.5847,1.7884,0.0612,1.9762,1.1653,0.0014,2.3447,5.5131,0.9491,2.5993,1.3516,0.6251,0.2034,0.2511,1.3734,4.9125,1.6555,1.5091,3.4287,1.3114,6.8811,0.1836,0.7032,0.0004,4.4798,4.2564,5.9072,3.7235,2.1087,5.3952,2.4038,0.2008,0.0002,2.4399,0.7524,1.618,3.4589,6.1628,2.7748,3.2568,0.7793,3.6824,1.8598,3.297,1.7255,4.3942,2.7072,2.7246,5.2016,6.1944,0.3684,0.1753,2.5118,2.3724,0.749,3.4608,0.0017,3.0246,2.2486,1.9227,6.3382,2.3157,0.0025,1.2084,1.2515,5.8634,0.7941,5.839,2.8617,0.6413,3.7808,0.3737,0.3251,0.1322,0.0002,3.7593,1.9488,1.3644,3.1864,3.2501,0.3813,5.4199,2.2791,4.9563,6.378,4.4554,1.1148,3.8183,4.3083,3.3977,2.3785,4.3093,0.0786,2.5588,0.5417,0.4828,2.5562,1.0932,0.0075,3.2048,2.6623,2.8989,0.2866,0.14,0.0002,0.6672,0.2881,2.8421,1.6341,0.8946,0.0143,4.6753,4.4226,6.189,6.5031,6.3241,6.1072,0.1955,2.4181,7.1335,2.0555,1.8193,4.4529,0.1775,2.6135,2.4782,0.9358,2.1664,1.1847,2.4439,2.6979,0.694,2.8869,2.7026,2.1194,4.111,1.8112,3.4353,0.428,1.6637,4.5123,3.1359,1.043,0.1018,0.0038,1.8614,1.6005,1.2763,6.1226,1.1188,2.6969,4.5521,2.4722,0.9225,0.2408,3.415,0.0013,0.4403,0.3023]}

{"id":1392,"ended":false,"length":524,"text":"While the Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge was the first railroad bridge across the river, the 1 @, @ 400 @ - @ foot ( 430 m ) Douglas Street Bridge opened in May 1942 \u2013 on the Union Pacific railroad bridge. The first commercial railroad bridge to cross the Missouri River entered service on 22 November 1942 while a second (3rd) bridge opened in the same month \u2013 on the U.S. railroad bridge in Union Pacific's Grand Traverse National Park. The Union Pacific Pacific Bridge closed in May 1944, but was closed in October 1944 after repairs to the bridge and to the Columbia River and the new bridge.\nOn March 20, 1965, the bridge was closed again for repairs following an outbreak of World War II that caused it to break up and close in June 1966. The bridge opened as a major service vessel for the Department of Homeland Security on 12 March 1965. It was closed on 3 August 1965 during the United States National Guard's withdrawal from World War II.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security built the first bridges south of the Mississippi in the mid-20th century, connecting the Missouri with the Mississippi River through the Missouri River. A series of bridges along the Missouri Valley became major bridges in the 20th century, connecting Arkansas and Mississippi to the Mississippi. The bridges included several major, but mostly single-track bridges, including the Missouri River and the Arkansas River, which both became major bridges in the early 20th century.\n\nThe Missouri and Arkansas rivers are mostly known for their many bridges, including the Missouri River, which is the only one to serve as a crossroads between the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Some bridges between Arkansas and Missouri are named after the river or simply in honor of its current owner, Charles J. \"Chuck\" McLean. They also feature several notable American and European bridges.\n\nThe Columbia River Bridge is the longest crossroads between the Missouri and the Kansas River, about  west of Lake Charles. It is the largest crossroads between the Missouri and the Kansas River in the U.S., reaching just over. The Columbia River is also known as the Old Columbia River Bridge. This bridge opened in 1637. In October 1567, the Missouri broke down as part of the Battle of Battle Creek. In January 1574, the Missouri broke down in 1656 and the Kansas broke down in 1711.\n\nAt least 1,600 miles east of St. Louis, Missouri, the Missouri River and Missouri Valley Bridge serve as an interchange between the Missouri River and the Mississippi River, while the Missouri River and Missouri Valley Railroad also serves as an interchange.\n\nSee also\nSoutheast Missouri River\nLouisiana State University\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nThe Missouri and Arkansas River Bridge at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\nThe American Bridge Project at U.S. National Park Service","token_len":583,"entropy":[2.2488,8.3813,7.3344,11.7947,2.0494,7.1577,1.6862,4.4068,2.4213,5.7194,0.6177,3.9457,0.3405,2.3442,1.3299,1.6056,7.6131,13.3643,6.7093,3.6644,8.7809,5.794,7.0624,4.3408,9.9656,5.1112,12.0257,4.2177,1.9549,11.142,5.0062,1.5594,4.0003,0.6782,4.8852,5.2515,8.3882,4.8138,1.526,6.9048,0.0136,4.1171,2.807,1.7047,1.4414,3.0069,5.4016,2.265,0.4067,2.6848,1.871,0.197,1.7185,0.3885,7.9267,0.2287,1.6321,6.0492,3.2174,1.2924,6.8385,3.7388,2.4775,4.6744,4.983,2.7504,0.4619,2.0103,3.1524,0.651,3.5489,1.6352,1.1281,4.8453,1.4634,0.2761,3.7157,0.1728,0.1282,0.0723,4.5677,0.4263,3.0992,5.0257,0.5313,3.8387,5.1816,4.7096,0.0565,5.6376,0.5926,0.6928,1.4336,3.2873,0.0117,4.5214,2.6551,4.3959,1.0383,2.7192,2.2021,1.9742,2.1389,2.2868,4.6851,2.2293,3.1957,1.8442,3.3393,5.2231,1.496,0.4601,1.1027,3.5268,3.7899,1.0355,5.6753,0.1624,3.7368,2.3956,6.5888,2.3522,2.4796,1.5057,9.7882,4.5279,3.1373,0.1635,4.6804,0.3916,0.7076,3.9773,0.7924,2.8296,3.8981,2.1964,1.7776,3.9001,2.5175,5.1477,0.0097,4.7245,0.0042,0.0968,4.9104,2.6797,2.1787,0.0102,3.9677,2.2349,1.8174,5.1747,2.1787,2.6949,2.9135,0.2083,1.3031,1.3064,4.0914,3.7187,0.7342,5.3656,4.3245,6.6956,2.1111,0.5311,6.0248,0.0154,5.4918,0.0135,2.5646,3.8499,2.4547,2.1403,0.8823,2.506,0.8675,3.2648,2.0288,4.0315,2.8121,2.0176,5.0316,1.1057,6.1565,0.5461,4.3804,1.0817,1.025,6.1382,0.3035,5.0329,0.004,0.0788,0.6169,1.0319,5.6795,1.4736,2.9893,0.0096,0.0097,0.0168,3.1122,0.0031,3.2655,0.0071,4.7254,0.6754,3.0928,6.3116,6.9467,0.0992,0.8335,1.3144,2.5811,2.3563,2.9637,0.319,4.0133,0.0301,0.1764,1.9013,4.1423,1.2805,3.4539,3.242,1.1132,1.1853,0.3366,4.321,1.2556,3.2852,0.4118,2.3526,4.0925,4.0974,0.005,1.8022,3.5366,0.1937,1.1165,5.7947,5.1059,4.1192,3.6487,1.7343,0.3351,2.9925,0.0164,0.1047,1.4677,2.7701,5.7829,1.5402,2.0732,3.162,0.6908,1.2483,2.0921,1.2996,3.5893,3.7571,4.8349,3.1486,4.8443,3.2769,2.7734,4.9041,0.5824,1.5497,1.4524,1.8068,2.0133,0.3825,3.0268,0.8461,2.247,0.6885,4.4322,0.2726,2.2231,1.7904,5.0042,3.7311,0.9668,1.88,0.8561,0.2282,3.1137,0.4806,0.0028,0.0328,0.1534,0.9829,0.0003,1.1212,3.666,4.4631,1.5252,3.2982,1.807,6.3982,4.4612,0.4304,0.2262,5.4266,3.2673,1.3362,2.2825,0.3462,1.7155,0.7168,1.3718,1.7593,1.9219,1.7709,2.8664,2.1389,2.2154,5.2365,1.7688,0.6642,4.3981,0.9448,0.7258,0.5487,2.4757,0.2448,2.0322,3.0677,0.4743,5.28,3.1451,4.612,4.0129,0.0312,0.85,1.4583,2.6155,0.7644,1.1218,1.7616,4.6838,5.2432,5.4898,2.2716,0.0478,1.9386,6.2499,4.7403,0.9967,5.4535,5.3909,0.0856,5.0598,1.7652,0.0416,6.2196,2.1744,0.7456,5.503,2.3528,3.442,3.5574,5.0243,4.1091,3.7064,1.3109,2.4742,1.6251,0.7987,0.0003,1.2976,5.3025,0.1438,1.7321,1.979,1.3325,2.5686,5.2549,2.765,1.2324,0.3701,0.9159,0.2795,1.241,4.6373,1.8187,1.5571,5.49,12.1832,12.4021,0.064,5.1432,2.0899,0.6193,1.2496,1.5073,1.6069,2.3346,1.6049,0.6146,1.2944,0.4563,0.5109,0.1641,0.808,1.0938,0.9118,3.1103,0.2777,2.9468,0.001,0.0019,1.2623,4.0267,5.2675,0.9799,9.1696,1.4801,2.0616,0.3499,1.7391,2.8774,1.5147,0.8874,0.3075,6.1135,3.6809,0.6342,2.9463,1.5004,3.9418,0.6979,4.2482,0.3199,5.209,5.0204,1.762,3.6994,5.7739,4.0545,4.1914,0.4137,1.1337,1.5184,6.9926,4.9779,4.1687,1.7692,0.0015,0.7383,5.3834,0.0234,7.1364,0.4664,1.2323,2.8837,4.0066,1.6098,3.2351,0.1465,0.5737,0.944,2.6351,0.4353,3.2008,5.1141,4.4087,2.3351,1.593,1.1207,3.7218,0.0858,0.5511,2.2299,4.1193,0.1897,1.3818,0.0003,4.9355,3.0942,4.2451,0.7503,3.7839,1.4193,4.8353,0.1065,4.614,0.2177,0.2371,0.4782,1.5681,0.4132,1.1466,1.0886,0.5983,3.8302,2.4569,1.2825,2.6184,4.819,0.3419,4.421,3.4159,0.7334,0.3727,0.9536,1.6053,0.1623,0.3381,1.6381,0.6752,1.7485,5.2071,0.4468,1.4068,0.8483,1.3928,1.0369,0.1392,5.6436,5.1596,3.6623,0.1212,2.0383,0.4117,1.8348,1.3558,0.0003,5.5461,1.2579,1.7039,17.0864,1.7606,0.7612,0.9303,3.5194,24.1537,0.2221,3.5822,3.7675,1.4574,0.0004,6.8452,1.1373,0.0008,3.2202,0.7405,0.0007,5.1729,0.5006,0.8727,16.6336,2.3566,2.794,0.4204,1.4694,1.8534,5.6255,1.6459,3.0082,0.0232,0.0102,0.0078,2.0254,0.0017,0.3656,0.0071,2.3686,15.8131,4.4952,1.6087,0.8687,2.7971,3.2587,0.0587,0.0064,0.0034,2.8051,2.4861,0.5562]}
{"id":973,"ended":true,"length":541,"text":"Federer and Agassi played each other 11 times between 1998 and 2005 before Agassi's retirement in 2006. Federer led the rivalry 8 \u2013 3. This was Federer's most significant rivalry with either Agassi, who had won the US Open 11 times before winning three of the last seven US Open titles (the first against Roger Federer), or Juan Martin de Sol (who had won only one of the last four US Open titles). Although this rival rivalry had never been so closely contested, the two had a significant advantage in age, as Federer had won more points in the 2004 and 2006 US Open finals and, along with his younger counterpart, had won more titles in two years.\n\nOn the way out from 2010, however, Federer had to turn his energies towards a more significant tennis venture to help him compete for the ATP rankings. The Australian Open was considered a prime contender for the ranking, but a disappointing season saw the 24-year-old lose his spot on the tour.\n\nIn 2011, in addition to both men's and women's events, Federer also played a crucial role in helping his country win the World Golf Ranking. Not only has he helped his country have success in the Asian Open in the past year, but the four-time Grand Slam champion has also shown some signs of turning up at the US Open in 2020.\n\nIn his defence of their World Golf Ranking final record, Federer played the strongest match to date. Against the Chinese Taipeiers, he recorded seven of the 15 points he needed to beat them for the first championship. However, as it turned out, the Australian was not that kind of match, as Agassi had the advantage in the first set and in the second.\n\nFollowing a victory over the Chinese Team GB at the 2012 London Olympics, Federer and Agassi had made many friends with the world-renowned tennis player, as well as the team that he played for. However, after losing the match, they found themselves with another match for Agassi to play at the World Golf Ranking final.\n\nAfter the win, Federer stated that he was still in high contact with Agassi. \"I don't want to insult him, because he's a good player, but I wanted to keep my friendship with him.

In the presence of the court and in the presence of the judges, the courts of Malaysia found that the criminal offence under section 2.9 was relevant under the Singapore penal law.\"","token_len":584,"entropy":[7.9574,0.281,12.2837,0.6599,13.2682,2.9575,8.3976,4.5566,1.3441,11.7998,14.7401,2.9962,5.555,5.2006,3.6666,1.5861,2.5813,4.6964,4.1446,8.7812,3.481,1.007,2.4206,9.0903,1.8793,4.9565,0.3367,1.622,4.397,7.6798,4.9052,0.7732,6.135,4.3838,5.0486,1.8181,2.0338,0.8223,4.1794,1.9654,2.0978,0.9607,1.3341,4.8851,2.5322,5.2822,0.0107,0.2227,0.9796,2.3895,4.0243,0.2972,1.5484,3.5807,5.505,1.4215,1.1511,0.001,2.4548,2.665,3.2029,1.2032,3.0539,3.5733,0.0733,3.5445,0.2813,1.6182,3.3486,2.4689,1.435,1.2798,0.8291,0.0566,0.1369,4.0626,1.3709,4.5782,3.6444,2.8278,4.1641,3.6186,0.0616,4.9952,1.8868,5.779,0.3125,5.1789,0.5581,1.6257,2.3529,3.878,2.868,3.2701,0.9157,4.2014,0.2122,0.5964,1.6018,3.0213,1.0597,1.3647,0.0003,5.6759,3.8303,10.5537,0.1228,3.6514,6.8621,3.4471,2.3328,7.2166,6.4928,4.9245,5.3973,2.5247,1.3548,0.7097,0.7504,0.0002,1.1195,4.1858,0.536,1.2212,4.0739,2.7907,4.4913,1.3268,2.9989,3.9644,0.041,4.379,2.9223,7.9469,4.3334,13.7873,5.5795,1.4051,0.6778,3.9473,0.3846,0.259,6.2088,3.4225,0.8068,2.6434,0.192,0.1785,0.0002,1.5114,1.6515,0.2617,3.861,4.8235,2.1179,5.7219,6.4561,3.1364,4.7626,6.1609,1.0455,7.2466,2.74,2.4846,1.2455,0.4802,0.0002,3.1691,0.0044,2.4446,4.3086,0.1658,1.4114,0.0003,0.0505,0.0003,12.314,0.1202,5.9592,5.1366,9.4503,5.7527,5.4298,3.9305,1.9043,4.9397,2.8602,2.4464,1.2652,0.0026,0.0015,0.2788,1.356,3.5051,5.1713,0.9231,5.9756,0.997,3.9497,2.7842,4.0107,0.6416,1.9376,2.2271,1.4429,5.9534,3.4903,0.1314,1.5635,5.1594,6.7223,3.57,0.0983,0.2114,6.7803,2.7433,4.8279,0.4011,0.1192,0.0002,2.1264,8.552,1.254,1.6883,3.9556,0.8686,0.5752,3.6883,5.5996,3.7794,2.8713,0.9918,4.6771,6.4651,3.4404,1.2593,4.4248,0.256,2.9803,1.4684,4.5165,2.9223,3.6076,4.0253,1.3398,3.1404,3.3081,3.7434,5.1054,1.27,0.1768,0.0002,3.8535,0.0067,2.2642,4.388,0.4932,6.2751,0.0001,4.5015,0.0408,1.6289,2.3454,0.0102,1.1837,1.621,1.4117,3.6637,0.0195,1.2629,2.8728,7.0772,2.0809,3.713,5.9847,4.0882,0.0043,2.6979,0.3749,2.075,2.1516,5.4257,3.4381,4.492,0.2688,4.1385,7.7408,6.1127,1.6312,1.1998,1.2634,2.8552,5.6085,2.2684,2.9595,0.2613,1.641,5.7282,4.6271,0.0077,3.0896,0.0019,6.2928,5.3061,4.6156,1.3727,3.3784,1.0798,4.807,0.2605,0.0599,0.0002,6.1664,5.346,0.8294,0.6683,2.7913,0.0023,0.9194,0.0051,4.8916,0.0184,1.5706,0.0021,0.1691,0.0061,0.0024,4.9321,2.0366,4.8252,0.3422,2.7201,1.3413,1.8491,1.1042,0.1459,0.0002,2.009,4.8882,5.8276,1.3161,2.2726,0.032,3.0075,1.3541,0.456,3.3016,0.0431,1.9092,2.3939,2.1765,5.6386,5.0454,2.4932,2.9015,2.1391,0.0184,1.7154,1.4227,0.202,3.3839,3.4104,0.5669,0.2022,0.0002,1.8566,2.267,0.0992,2.5018,3.0543,2.1848,0.4534,0.7636,1.0209,4.4062,4.1543,4.689,3.6931,4.4302,2.898,10.3183,0.734,5.0181,4.1359,6.7619,2.8798,3.8931,2.6223,4.1694,1.0241,0.3567,1.8072,0.1021,0.693,1.7866,0.8792,1.2881,4.5021,5.442,2.6488,3.3544,0.9303,1.9171,0.6061,1.8726,4.4605,1.1484,1.8352,1.7034,4.3723,3.4934,1.8868,4.6734,2.1049,0.1444,0.1475,0.0002,7.808,0.0041,0.615,0.0012,0.3042,0.0022,0.0016,4.8035,3.2913,0.0035,0.7957,0.0009,8.3087,1.1406,5.6195,2.8845,3.7709,4.3899,1.6995,3.2818,3.2341,2.8663,2.1801,3.8495,1.5584,4.3804,1.797,6.2215,1.582,3.3854,0.9189,5.3199,0.0083,0.0183,0.0013,0.6346,1.5066,1.2604,0.0185,0.9915,4.0509,7.6179,3.9901,0.5607,0.3245,3.7576,0.0155,0.3361,4.2783,1.2721,4.5133,3.3765,0.2554,2.8278,4.9915,4.2456,1.2608,3.3734,4.3676,4.8001,5.9074,0.0793,0.1153,0.0001,1.0546,1.5538,6.1575,3.9186,3.7329,4.8542,0.5586,3.4844,3.5583,3.3727,2.7325,2.5276,6.4367,3.6975,0.3218,4.4154,2.043,3.3224,4.8298,0.9553,1.2122,8.3413,0.014,0.123,5.2806,1.7591,0.0969,0.0001,1.9631,3.5843,0.0482,4.7732,2.9389,2.6799,1.9695,2.5009,2.8968,2.5763,0.6345,0.6408,2.1574,4.2163,1.4157,0.6961,0.0598,0.0135,0.0403,0.6271,0.1435,0.0516,0.0033,0.0181,0.5899,1.8294,5.1837,2.5347,2.856,7.2037,1.0324,1.1372,4.1536,2.6509,6.0323,1.0395,0.0972,2.8191,3.3711,2.1924,5.8934,0.0057,1.026,1.5872,3.0239,3.013,1.0361,0.8127,0.005,0.4733,5.9171,1.2285,0.6452,3.6947,1.397,0.101,3.1561,0.3338,0.7014,4.8905,1.2184,1.6969,0.3517,0.0328,0.0052,0.0147,1.984,5.8741,3.7877,1.0872,2.272,0.0685,0.1024,1.1684]}

{"id":4168,"ended":true,"length":539,"text":"The fourth quarter began with Clemson in possession of the ball and starting a drive at its 20 @ - @ yard line following a touchback. On the first play of the drive, the Bluejays drove to the field on third and 1, leading into the home territory, the ball was intercepted, and the Bluejays drove off with just time out, the #7 Clemson offense was able to stop a drive & give us @ 17 + + 3 \u2013 3 with 2 minutes left to play. pic.twitter.com\/2kOeNxZtpf \u2014 Clemson Game on @GameonTV (@ ClemsonOnTV) October 6, 2017\nAt 22-21, the Clemson offense had all of its big plays but had to turn it over twice to end the game. With nearly two minutes left in the first half, Clemson outgained the Bluejays 33-22. On the first snap of the second quarter, Clemson had five plays of 8 yards or more and had to turn it over twice to end the game.\nWhat followed was a big fourth quarter for the Demon Deacons, who put in a performance where they allowed a touchdown and only seven plays, all to set up a big fourth and long drive, with Clemson in a 1-3 against No. 2 Clemson. The Demon Deacons were able to hang hard throughout the game, and their momentum started to swing before it ended.\nClemson at South Carolina\nThe game was extremely tight early in the game after Clemson allowed their opponent to score twice, but also only nine points. On the other end, South Carolina had to rush for at least five points, which led the Bluejays into the end zone twice in the first half. On the third and 4, Clemson made a little bit more mistakes than they had allowed in first halves this season, so it was a huge learning curve for Clemson to start the season against a ranked opponent.\nIn the second half against Clemson, Clemson was able to force three plays for the offense, which ended up contributing to a big first half. The game was very tight until the second half, as Clemson got a pass from Seth Roberts, who had run out on three of Clemson\u2019s first five possessions to put the ball at the Clemson 25-yard line in the 5:46 fourth quarter. After Clemson held on to score on three more long plays, Clemson finished with just 28 rushing yards.\nOn a first down by Clemson, the defense forced a game of penalties and forced a punt by South Carolina, throwing eight yards of offense for a touchdown, the Bluejays offense finished the game with just seven points for the day and just three more field goals, which they had against Louisville and Kentucky.\nWhat next? Clemson will end up making the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament, but with two more games remaining, it would be a lot like the Orange Bowl with a better crowd.","token_len":590,"entropy":[8.417,4.6459,5.212,0.7261,7.7998,4.6272,4.7528,0.4454,1.1021,1.5582,2.2392,6.2057,3.1199,2.2898,3.9039,3.6659,5.9952,15.0763,8.0584,7.1535,6.9389,0.7346,8.0497,0.6932,6.5973,0.0736,1.3945,4.2239,0.8358,3.3151,0.6531,0.8519,0.1092,0.7503,0.2908,2.3264,5.2131,3.9923,0.006,4.8095,1.3942,0.4773,5.9498,3.6365,4.484,1.5719,3.9641,1.4339,6.2723,6.4595,0.9912,7.1599,4.3633,2.8463,4.3985,2.8665,1.9124,3.0884,3.8094,0.8846,1.4092,1.937,0.0174,0.0002,4.4448,4.2294,3.0935,3.9018,7.7011,7.5786,3.3808,3.539,7.3105,4.0912,1.8475,2.669,2.8908,2.8932,0.0079,4.8023,3.803,1.717,9.243,4.3283,4.5642,8.2379,5.6211,5.6492,5.2551,4.0602,6.2928,3.6405,4.6309,3.3103,2.39,0.4394,2.7835,0.2874,0.3309,6.9732,0.0007,0.0001,0.0005,0.0002,0.0008,4.4704,4.2196,4.6386,4.3304,4.5283,3.6099,4.2082,8.1549,5.0902,0.1641,1.3074,5.5743,6.8713,6.7181,4.8222,3.1655,3.5474,0.1127,8.3604,5.6813,0.1337,0.0219,2.095,3.4496,0.0002,0.8017,0.1187,13.9193,7.2248,2.3499,2.1926,0.3468,1.2889,3.5349,0.962,2.5276,5.6482,1.8484,1.3603,5.4629,0.4148,4.9574,3.5054,1.41,5.2997,2.5309,0.424,3.7377,1.7619,3.7879,0.3582,1.4236,0.3928,4.0175,5.863,2.685,0.1798,0.5571,0.9563,0.074,2.9212,0.3236,0.2035,1.3344,6.1716,3.1554,0.018,0.8212,0.9156,0.0162,0.0001,4.5569,0.0717,3.2809,1.0947,3.6355,0.4159,4.1578,5.4739,1.0189,0.1296,1.8996,1.2517,0.1196,1.1463,2.6755,5.355,1.8138,2.348,6.4702,0.9949,0.2116,0.4781,2.2673,2.493,1.9586,3.64,0.7213,0.0656,2.3276,0.7871,0.5989,0.0849,0.1665,0.1788,1.8728,5.7475,4.4756,0.4066,0.6481,4.4809,5.157,0.1502,1.798,0.9393,7.6916,0.309,0.0015,1.9627,1.2621,4.9868,4.2748,0.9834,4.1523,5.3511,0.3637,4.4445,2.6239,2.6172,2.4166,4.4566,6.1698,3.4583,4.2371,4.912,4.2528,6.151,0.299,0.9681,3.7373,3.4181,4.9426,4.5171,2.9569,3.5491,2.8183,1.7023,4.1032,3.0138,4.5319,0.3187,3.3365,10.6342,4.2085,0.0067,2.5506,1.6607,0.5195,2.0185,2.0645,0.04,0.0046,2.779,1.0263,0.0061,6.5016,7.658,4.3368,0.3092,1.1602,0.968,2.691,4.2458,5.4365,3.5278,0.2114,5.6498,5.4145,3.1075,5.0878,0.954,1.3001,2.5118,0.0,6.4545,5.2385,0.0451,1.4969,2.043,2.5243,1.554,5.2229,3.7034,3.9747,0.8971,0.0253,1.1845,5.4758,1.2624,5.2252,4.9898,4.2719,0.5489,2.2096,4.523,1.9818,1.5595,5.7614,6.6138,6.6754,0.8463,1.4579,3.6992,0.3069,4.325,1.3014,0.9227,2.898,0.0001,1.9636,3.0818,5.6027,1.4304,4.9378,0.0092,3.2985,2.317,2.0347,2.4159,2.754,4.5112,2.4906,0.0161,0.0001,2.7401,0.9371,1.2279,0.1321,5.8626,2.9265,0.2272,1.5021,0.283,0.5706,2.8913,0.2523,1.607,2.4536,2.8065,0.7424,0.8574,4.3951,1.4764,6.8492,2.2593,2.3691,6.4007,3.0317,1.1379,1.774,4.2989,2.1818,7.1854,3.8463,3.1059,0.8299,0.5004,4.8616,2.0165,0.6634,1.4916,4.061,5.4332,0.6267,0.5351,2.1006,2.4286,3.7371,1.3369,1.8619,4.0538,1.3507,2.195,0.7986,0.3852,0.7717,3.6754,0.2855,1.3911,0.1315,4.6031,2.0844,0.0846,0.9041,2.4554,0.4874,0.0036,4.0391,3.6996,3.047,3.8984,1.8103,4.3678,0.8033,2.5282,4.1555,0.8655,6.4674,0.5326,1.2309,2.879,3.7651,0.2343,1.4534,1.821,3.1428,1.4971,2.7671,2.3724,4.5175,0.7281,3.1018,0.3274,1.1887,2.0302,0.6073,3.7444,2.303,4.7331,1.3923,8.176,3.5185,1.8912,1.1949,2.195,5.0471,2.9193,4.0088,4.8725,2.3531,3.4859,19.0329,6.7399,0.8489,1.7648,2.3411,2.5585,3.5138,3.0995,0.9024,2.4435,3.4934,0.9542,2.2612,4.0253,1.7555,0.0748,0.0075,4.0116,0.2837,6.2321,1.1056,3.8954,9.4506,0.0201,0.2383,3.3506,2.9488,5.4297,1.5842,0.6464,3.8528,2.8693,2.7009,2.6219,7.6352,2.6847,0.5702,1.6153,4.621,1.4167,2.904,5.786,5.2743,0.104,1.8831,0.8687,2.6832,3.9642,4.254,0.8483,3.4644,1.3983,0.3644,1.585,4.4283,2.9739,1.4974,6.1411,6.3394,4.8257,2.6598,3.2426,1.5302,3.0841,2.3662,3.8562,0.0004,1.5389,7.2623,6.5316,2.7264,2.9929,4.7088,3.9911,1.4163,1.1646,2.5899,3.8785,3.0238,0.0148,0.0002,6.5083,4.2102,1.734,0.1995,0.5546,1.7767,3.6307,0.9615,4.7542,0.6627,4.1228,3.5177,3.9312,2.7771,4.1514,5.5491,0.4202,3.2382,2.774,3.9575,2.7803,6.2301,5.4035,1.8674,4.1533,0.4228,0.6847,4.7603,5.1807,1.1687,2.3379,2.5593,6.4763,0.7302,3.7054,1.0885,6.3988,0.1927,0.0037,2.3688,1.8995,1.951,3.7813,3.7,2.1308,0.4364,2.6157,0.9571,1.9473,3.1732,0.4027,1.6985,4.9815,4.855,1.3641,4.4019,2.6577,4.4359,2.2642,4.1435,5.6444,1.1394]}
{"id":1448,"ended":true,"length":518,"text":"On December 5, Capital One Bowl officials announced Alabama would face the Big Ten co @ - @ champion Michigan State Spartans in the 2011 Capital One Bowl. In a strong defensive performance, Alabama dominated Michigan State, 20-3. pic.twitter.com\/a3k8OQQhBn \u2014 FOX Sports Alabama (@FOXSportsAlabama) December 6, 2011\n\nIn the opening four weeks of the 2010-11 season, Alabama lost 41-20 against the Big Ten leaders. However, those losses did nothing to dent the Tide\u2019s reputation as one of the top programs and the most influential one of all time. In 2009, only two years old, Alabama did not win a bowl game, but the Tide had had two strong seasons and were a legitimate threat as teams to match those four seasons.\n\nIn December, Alabama was able to come off an early-season defeat to Mississippi State to force a second bowl game, but that loss was much harder to come by because Alabama was in the best position to win its division, going 13-1. The Tide won the next game that day, with a 36-21 win, before losing for only the second time in program history.\n\nDuring the SEC\u2019s run-in with college football, one of Alabama\u2019s key players was Alabama quarterback Nick Saban. He was always the most reliable player on LSU. If it didn\u2019t look like Saban was making a major play on a game-day snap, Alabama coach Steve Sarkisian\u2019s defense was going to be in trouble. Alabama had to score early on to beat Penn State in the national title game, and the Tigers played the Crimson Tide twice in the postseason.\n\nFollowing a victory over the Penn State Wolfpack in the title game, Alabama head coach Bill Snyder announced that Saban \u201cwill be out for the season with a sprained ankle.\u201d After a short return to the team website, Saban was expected to return to the team for the 2010-91 season, but a suspension took effect.\n\nDespite his troubles, Saban is likely to be able to play at Alabama\u2019s next game, October 15th, when Auburn takes on the Tide. Alabama\u2019s next game was January 1 against the Illinois Scarlet Wolfpack. Saban would be the last Crimson Tide coach to return from a serious injury.\n\nIf Alabama can overcome adversity and make an impact, that could serve as a blueprint for a tough game against Auburn on October 1st. This may not come as news to many, but Alabama might be able to get past Auburn in the SEC championship game. It would certainly be a great game for the Tide, which hasn\u2019t made the NCAA Tournament since 2011, making Alabama an interesting match-up against the reigning nation\u2019s top program.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\nLike this: Like Loading...","token_len":590,"entropy":[8.0222,3.2545,0.3923,10.6431,1.3563,10.7041,3.9066,1.3011,11.1788,2.1776,5.5707,2.2158,5.1452,1.7167,10.8644,12.6378,9.1325,4.3634,10.85,3.6484,1.2697,3.7663,1.6049,0.6807,6.9944,4.0507,0.0048,0.0742,0.5267,4.5149,2.0317,7.1839,5.749,1.0123,0.5675,1.9441,4.0642,1.3706,0.1298,2.0873,5.7494,0.0236,2.4682,1.1071,5.3785,0.0012,0.0,0.0004,0.0002,0.0007,4.5551,3.8598,4.3285,4.0686,4.6246,3.9551,4.2297,4.4746,4.2229,4.3077,0.17,4.5781,0.7044,1.679,0.0212,0.5732,0.6378,0.3724,0.0055,0.1441,1.7006,0.0004,0.581,0.1778,0.0004,3.2029,1.4619,4.3774,5.1412,3.7538,0.1043,0.4099,3.8034,3.8199,0.1074,0.1153,0.0462,0.8602,3.7738,5.7216,0.6368,2.897,4.3659,1.8989,2.4072,0.0273,6.1991,1.1367,4.0044,0.0108,5.063,0.3903,3.5555,6.329,0.0649,5.2131,0.8446,2.6925,14.383,8.1217,5.2848,2.7349,1.0825,1.83,0.007,0.0598,2.5609,2.1529,6.1648,2.6046,2.7286,5.5595,5.4836,2.96,1.4059,0.4641,0.1565,2.9511,4.186,0.3486,5.8173,2.1123,2.4943,6.028,0.1137,0.7768,5.1452,0.3799,2.4756,1.0548,1.49,0.1045,2.5921,1.6812,2.5736,2.1522,3.2585,5.8291,3.1333,5.7646,0.7299,2.7552,4.1772,2.9778,5.4289,2.1242,4.2088,7.1391,4.0484,8.2409,6.1429,5.1997,1.5802,0.4028,0.9718,0.0003,2.0388,5.1439,1.7422,2.2461,2.8753,4.4632,0.0087,4.7718,4.7554,3.3781,4.1147,2.4998,0.0485,3.7592,0.5786,5.3198,0.0645,2.4758,5.2097,1.1065,3.5274,1.7977,0.401,2.3835,1.412,2.591,2.6176,1.3158,5.0445,4.4389,0.3602,2.9728,0.0473,4.5001,2.4444,1.598,3.6362,1.2856,5.6725,1.3569,0.3512,1.5099,3.5394,3.6564,2.8958,5.9786,4.2247,0.0166,2.1062,1.5288,2.1293,2.0184,3.4686,1.3832,4.0925,3.6512,5.1618,2.7641,0.9776,5.1718,1.4582,4.5776,0.0124,2.6936,1.0979,4.5047,4.0974,1.5849,4.7388,5.3591,0.1764,0.8776,0.0143,0.4025,3.5954,0.0058,0.8147,0.8526,0.0002,4.5694,0.7458,4.6321,13.6166,0.7637,0.1077,3.5144,4.0884,0.2838,1.4667,7.74,0.2042,0.4067,6.7352,0.5356,2.9237,2.9544,0.0808,0.0024,4.0541,1.5435,1.0305,3.4999,2.8243,2.0924,0.0193,0.8141,4.1902,1.1986,5.6217,2.7751,3.2984,4.898,1.8011,0.7545,7.1496,3.5907,6.3037,4.502,3.4658,2.8994,1.327,0.2719,3.395,0.2614,0.813,1.085,4.0775,1.5224,4.0148,4.6798,2.6533,3.6904,2.0539,1.6488,4.4878,6.6455,0.7154,2.5964,5.6892,5.1179,0.439,0.0006,0.0004,3.5384,0.0072,0.1501,3.4147,1.4065,2.5046,0.1383,1.6337,2.7913,1.5531,0.291,2.8894,2.3631,2.8892,4.676,5.33,2.7969,1.4329,3.4502,5.633,0.0099,1.8632,0.5141,4.154,0.754,0.01,1.0228,1.4683,2.3727,2.8167,4.3793,2.724,4.0051,0.0017,5.1782,1.1237,0.7484,6.7575,0.7141,0.7978,0.0002,5.6512,2.4797,5.0509,0.6103,2.4766,4.2955,0.0251,6.3596,0.1817,1.1849,0.3152,3.9213,0.0068,0.2681,1.462,5.7866,0.0053,4.2811,3.1419,4.04,0.8635,1.5649,3.429,7.8553,5.7902,1.0102,4.5362,0.8645,0.6439,0.905,1.6379,0.366,4.0835,0.002,1.2119,0.7719,9.6329,7.7944,4.1311,2.3948,4.0306,6.4668,0.6194,1.2338,3.3246,8.5405,0.3758,0.9524,1.8718,4.5537,0.1704,1.0173,0.9173,1.1008,1.6549,2.0687,0.8265,4.3715,0.7521,14.4657,0.0886,1.3358,0.4003,3.9683,4.9633,5.6496,0.9976,2.043,1.2636,0.0002,4.0346,2.4905,6.3555,0.9062,0.2045,3.3178,5.6234,0.4417,1.3792,2.8097,0.0029,2.0472,2.6204,1.8389,4.6537,0.0175,0.0234,2.3073,2.3938,1.6043,4.7991,3.5359,2.5944,2.1174,2.5539,4.52,3.5734,0.0128,1.6872,5.6955,0.872,2.6353,4.5343,0.016,0.0097,2.2559,1.3702,4.2976,7.4611,3.2023,4.7854,2.0163,5.5768,6.9994,9.9915,1.0282,0.7074,3.369,4.1872,1.55,1.5291,2.9701,4.0348,0.0025,3.2997,0.4872,2.4321,2.6207,1.1521,4.7707,0.1923,1.3611,0.5209,0.0003,4.2618,1.342,2.4187,2.7802,3.2806,1.5839,3.3131,3.4794,1.0137,1.6686,3.9597,2.1927,7.0084,0.4031,0.6324,3.3187,0.1825,2.7495,8.4477,4.7589,0.7825,4.5088,2.3662,2.2154,3.4425,0.6364,0.4168,4.5396,4.4032,1.8727,3.7132,0.4503,6.136,0.1784,1.3686,1.3621,0.0995,3.0876,4.6529,1.2628,1.2457,0.0085,3.275,4.1912,2.1256,2.1579,0.848,2.4206,2.4361,0.0452,0.8037,4.1807,2.0079,4.2692,0.9972,0.9157,2.5714,3.1546,0.532,1.5728,0.639,1.6569,3.6048,5.337,0.7424,0.227,0.1218,4.8377,1.5417,2.0012,2.1785,0.8587,3.7937,2.109,5.3754,3.7999,3.2959,2.8149,4.628,0.3581,0.0121,2.873,1.5527,5.0176,4.9109,4.5389,0.0802,0.0731,2.4323,2.7175,0.3885,0.6229,0.0004,6.5728,0.1825,0.0727,2.9483,3.0323,0.0003,4.1233,0.0158,0.0009,0.0001,0.0,0.0061]}

In 2007 there were an average of 53.7 million tons in the production. In 2013 there were a little more than 3 million tons.\n\nConsequantly, the report highlighted that the China Antimony Industry Development Project, which supports exports of Antimony to domestic markets, estimated that Antimony production will reach US$11.5 billion by 2020, while the current Antimony production capacity is expected to reach US$17.12 billion by 2020.\n\nThe report said that further efforts were needed to improve the processing capacity in Antimony processing plants for export to domestic markets, making Antimony the first national producer.\n\n\"Therefore, the Antimony Association believes that an expansion of production capability in Antimony processing facilities in China has the potential to help accelerate the development of China's China Antimony Industry,\" the report noted.","token_len":593,"entropy":[7.8726,7.6647,0.0044,1.7149,5.2794,0.016,0.1731,4.4048,1.1518,3.4249,4.551,1.0057,6.6725,2.7304,0.973,4.7539,1.8674,0.1035,8.9597,2.748,4.2726,2.0691,8.3144,6.1621,4.6519,7.336,3.8581,1.8417,1.4802,6.8562,1.2975,5.6615,1.5413,3.1021,1.6285,1.7334,2.7171,0.5903,5.9156,1.3511,0.6467,2.3213,0.5325,7.2814,0.4954,3.4497,0.4318,4.5068,0.4226,5.1356,0.2684,2.0961,1.6338,1.7944,1.1266,0.1844,1.5683,0.0018,4.9627,1.7419,4.7741,0.3411,5.167,4.7033,3.0697,2.025,0.0138,6.7489,2.0217,2.2219,3.2531,0.181,1.2015,6.6642,0.9535,0.865,0.0099,3.1082,0.5891,1.8234,3.9884,5.3286,0.0534,5.3121,1.8797,5.1458,6.1879,3.21,0.034,1.0843,5.9574,0.008,5.2752,3.0042,1.2395,0.6186,4.0465,0.5169,0.9,0.0003,5.6477,2.4025,5.1121,1.456,0.0949,6.6766,2.5678,1.0887,3.7941,0.1749,1.9049,0.0034,1.4032,1.8442,3.9677,8.006,3.2404,0.4792,2.8945,0.3493,4.4591,4.3779,3.3624,1.4954,4.9264,0.0235,0.0205,1.1131,5.7424,0.017,2.5628,3.0766,0.2184,0.0333,0.5026,0.7607,0.0002,5.2223,1.7029,1.6299,0.0077,2.0127,7.3422,4.4041,3.0481,2.9237,2.6601,2.2252,2.0435,0.5809,2.2022,0.0265,5.6632,3.4935,0.2402,2.1216,3.2827,0.3694,4.1813,0.0078,6.2157,2.2364,0.5765,2.976,0.9673,2.8729,0.0072,3.7293,4.8061,0.0023,6.7802,4.7595,4.09,4.5575,1.4267,1.3877,1.479,0.4153,0.0003,1.599,0.7942,4.2617,2.198,0.1684,2.564,2.1311,2.2097,1.7112,0.0153,3.046,6.5466,0.06,8.5119,0.7554,0.0279,0.5831,1.7853,4.6865,4.0998,2.1015,1.7499,0.5084,0.0003,5.3304,1.7053,0.003,5.1062,0.2704,3.0312,5.2246,6.1719,0.267,1.871,5.4584,0.0579,4.7462,0.695,0.9391,1.3977,1.426,1.5379,0.0051,3.331,0.979,1.6983,6.3935,4.7243,2.1849,5.6868,4.648,2.2397,2.926,3.1249,6.9952,4.4377,1.4394,2.3984,0.3902,0.1898,3.3333,3.1843,0.2703,1.3587,1.4549,2.9603,0.9647,0.0151,0.2625,0.1504,0.0003,2.6384,2.2791,1.6774,5.2323,0.6065,4.0727,3.3916,1.2808,2.6391,3.6764,0.0157,0.1043,4.4353,4.3066,3.9213,1.1755,2.9799,2.5573,1.2597,4.4728,0.5294,0.6868,0.8574,0.3708,0.0004,5.8111,0.5959,2.1978,1.194,1.7849,0.003,0.553,1.5637,6.7794,5.314,1.7389,3.2795,1.7187,4.6392,0.0522,1.4143,3.0625,0.978,0.6315,0.0002,2.0377,1.3352,4.7809,1.2769,0.0069,4.7815,1.3939,5.9919,1.5717,1.0913,0.319,0.58,0.0093,7.1786,2.4771,1.2764,4.7299,1.1626,6.5773,5.8043,0.5067,1.8331,4.262,0.04,2.8146,4.8857,6.0492,1.7511,5.3171,0.5508,0.9815,4.3502,0.1484,5.8121,3.7536,6.2653,6.7034,0.2678,5.0484,2.6942,1.6086,1.2666,0.2308,0.0002,3.0551,0.0024,2.8115,4.187,0.2384,2.2618,3.5028,2.8593,3.5399,0.5343,2.6522,0.2571,2.0052,0.0037,1.3776,5.5992,4.9147,0.1277,5.0501,0.5554,2.6181,0.1599,3.5648,6.626,0.4887,4.4904,2.8142,1.1519,1.2414,1.9376,2.261,1.6257,0.6559,0.0876,0.1725,0.0114,4.4586,0.1626,2.2485,0.004,0.5019,11.5011,0.0223,3.5119,0.3317,2.2764,0.0159,5.6466,1.2647,0.2928,4.8248,0.2888,2.2824,0.0347,2.884,5.2962,7.0901,1.3838,0.3421,0.0003,6.8024,4.1308,5.237,2.9012,0.0044,4.1012,3.8892,1.4349,3.4123,0.0504,0.9587,2.2388,3.0422,5.9582,0.5947,1.8165,4.7998,0.1898,3.1329,0.0095,0.5747,1.3622,1.1777,1.2821,3.928,1.9587,3.4893,0.2748,4.2887,1.4937,0.1164,6.6687,1.3862,2.4274,1.4038,0.1893,3.9559,1.868,2.3929,3.5477,1.7968,4.8854,0.9544,0.0858,2.7724,6.3811,1.5652,0.0593,4.1698,0.902,0.0265,0.6344,0.3793,0.0003,5.1485,2.5417,8.8579,0.4358,1.6543,3.6384,4.6375,0.7436,1.9891,3.8526,0.5682,0.0104,1.2427,0.6439,3.2563,2.7308,1.3385,5.5406,6.0324,1.0768,1.3342,0.0037,0.7161,5.9673,1.273,0.4522,7.1938,0.3583,2.7242,0.0035,0.8916,3.477,1.7984,1.1074,0.0048,4.3427,0.3826,2.061,0.0789,1.1298,2.0883,2.4028,3.194,1.2076,5.1259,2.1411,0.0032,0.7441,4.257,1.2388,2.4722,0.0053,0.5981,0.1662,0.017,3.2635,0.3411,8.2483,0.012,0.3122,1.0534,0.1367,0.2551,0.0003,1.6478,1.1952,3.6078,0.4316,6.6016,5.0204,2.9401,1.8073,0.2335,2.8057,0.7905,7.2991,2.3419,3.0514,3.0173,0.0106,3.621,1.6225,4.3864,3.8278,1.2713,2.3602,0.2359,2.0497,6.1677,1.9241,0.0027,3.5772,3.0087,6.2342,3.0059,3.6335,0.3058,0.0003,3.2162,6.0928,0.336,1.7349,2.6566,0.0054,6.9004,4.6269,0.245,4.5119,5.2375,0.2783,2.7272,5.144,1.4338,1.5097,0.0057,1.6598,2.0207,2.5206,0.2266,3.7553,1.7156,0.0795,0.0243,3.3103,3.7389,0.6747,2.0886,0.1332,2.7202,0.0707,7.0434,0.3406,0.0192,1.1209,3.7657,1.0016,0.319,3.2489,0.0448]}
{"id":3909,"ended":true,"length":506,"text":"In early 2000, Croatia and Serbia set up a commission tasked with determining the border, but in its first ten years it convened only once or twice. Since 2010, the issue of the border on the Croatian-Serbian frontier continues to plague the Croatian territory.\n\nIn 2013, the Croatian Foreign Ministry published a joint statement marking their first-ever joint report on the ongoing border between the two nations \u2013 including on the situation of the Croatian-Serbian border. The report notes that:\n\n\u201cDuring the last decade, Croatia and Serbia have fought a very different battle, but on the one hand, the Croatian and Serbian forces remain firmly in place as the dominant force against the Croatian forces and the Serbian forces.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, the presence of Serbia on the Croatian side is a threat to the Croatian-Serbian border, as a consequence of the territorial integrity of Croatia and Serbia.\n\n\u201cFor Croatia and Serbia, the border is a symbol and symbol of joint effort and mutual unity. The border lies close to the Croatian-Serbian border and there is no place for confrontation with the Serbian side.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, it is highly probable and must be understood that despite the long-standing territorial dispute, the Croatian-Serbian border remains open.\n\n\u201cThe current border dispute is not only a national issue; it is also a matter of personal feelings. At the same time, the Croatian\/Serbian border and its surroundings are extremely important and essential for Croatia\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cThe Croatian-Serbian border is important because at the present time, the Croatian-Serbian border provides the Croatian government with an important tool in the negotiation process and the way forward. There are many Croatian factors which must be considered while deciding on the future of the Croatian-Serbian border.\n\n\u201cThe Croatian government will continue to work on the basis of existing international and national laws and the new border settlement policy of \u2018HRC-Zamun\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Croatia and Serbia have continued their relationship, as recently as 2017. They agreed to set up a \u2018HRC-Zamun\u2019 in Zadar, while the local government will be engaged in cooperation with the Croatian side, and Croatia and Serbia have signed an agreement on a border settlement agreement. However, there have appeared at least 6 border issues, including those relating to the Croatian-Serbian border. Since 2014, after both nations broke away, Croatia and Serbia have still managed to solve their border dispute diplomatically.\n\nAt the same time, for Croatia and Serbia, there has been an excellent effort to negotiate and resolve the Croatian-Serbian border issues, which was initiated by the Croatian and Serbian administrations in 2017.

{"id":3553,"ended":false,"length":434,"text":"Besides the horse, there are seven other species of genus Equus in the Equidae family. These are the ass or donkey, Equus asinus ; the mountain zebra, Equus zebra ; plains zebra ; and the white elephant, Equus stelatus (Trifornia, 1998)\n\nThe white elephant is one of two species of equus-like, with eight species of equus. Equus (Trifornia, 1998) is the most prolific species with a total of 21 species. Equus (Trifornia, 1998) consists of a very large class and has a population density and population density of 5,600 species per million inhabitants (Sedney 1999). Equus (Trifornia, 1998) is one of the most important and highly invasive species in the world. With nearly twice as many species of equus in his or her population as Equus (Trifornia, 1998), Equus (Trifornia, 1998), equus (Trifornia, 1998) is in most areas of Northern California, which may include San Francisco. Equus (Trifornia, 1998) consists of a long and well-defined, or semi-obscured, subclade of equus-like and equine-like animals, usually called elephant (Tricorium). They grow up to eight inches (22 centimetres) long and their main home is in the head where they lie on the ground. They eat their prey as they move about, usually eating their prey from their roots.\n\nThe equa are of the same order and species as the equus (Trifornia, 1998-99).
