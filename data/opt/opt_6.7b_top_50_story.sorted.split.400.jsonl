{"id":2816,"ended":true,"length":390,"text":"You have just successfully made your first trip to the International Space Station, you are looking down at Earth, admiring the gorgeous view. You see a small light, it and then several hundred more across the globe. They were nuclear bombs. You try to contact Huston, but no one responds. You have spent the best part of your life training for this, so you grab control of the Soyuz capsule. It will take you a few attempts before you can get out of the capsule and out through the airlock, but you manage. You then make it down to the space station's surface, slowly and painfully. You then see that there, in the distance is a very large mountain and a small city on and under it. There are 3 things that you want to do asap, one is to contact Houston, the second thing is to contact your family back home and tell them that you made it to space, not to mention the third one is to see if there are any survivors. As you descend to the City you are constantly worried that the radiation will get you, and you will get too tired and fall to pieces. At this point you hear a faint engine noise, you then see a jet flying very close to you. The jet stops and gets off the ground, and then stops again. Then a large red button on the front is pressed. A small door in the jet opens and a man emerges. You try to stop him, but your fear is just too great, the man has a gun and is pointing it at you. What should you do?\n\nSolution : To protect both yourself and him, your immediate impulse would be to use the Soyuz capsule to escape into space. You will then either fall uncontrollably to your death or the rocket will fly a safe distance away from you. The only other option is that he will shoot the rocket and kill both of you.\n\nI hope this works ; it is too hard to explain it so well.","token_len":401,"entropy":[3.7506,5.0656,7.0641,4.3005,1.8161,2.2352,5.0666,0.4534,1.3029,5.7122,0.8907,0.0031,1.696,1.9675,2.0052,4.9886,6.6269,1.2884,5.2705,2.0279,7.8893,0.0027,0.5914,5.48,2.4667,2.3742,2.2152,3.4869,2.1812,4.0555,6.8039,3.2895,5.2963,7.8235,4.518,6.702,3.4575,3.9281,9.6388,0.3884,4.1467,1.0758,5.6122,4.815,11.1833,3.1282,1.384,2.2936,6.2193,0.2248,6.5502,17.7727,1.5181,1.5057,1.2611,3.846,0.9979,2.5601,0.281,1.5416,3.1337,4.7943,1.5427,5.8105,0.333,0.0007,1.9252,0.5716,6.6989,2.5451,1.6381,2.5494,3.1165,0.7448,8.4452,8.1047,0.3543,1.2349,6.3569,0.0003,2.0731,1.8797,2.9577,3.9674,1.9839,0.6882,2.3166,1.1396,6.7156,2.6866,0.4315,1.6541,2.1182,3.5538,0.8949,1.1582,0.9238,1.5002,4.1262,5.7511,0.4005,3.915,5.217,2.1404,1.227,0.925,4.2148,2.5536,1.5539,4.9223,4.1292,2.3597,4.4729,0.5797,0.7359,3.9109,0.0596,3.9322,2.6858,1.3284,6.6274,2.9291,3.7291,1.415,1.5834,5.4612,3.4708,2.8317,2.6321,5.7315,2.0867,0.9434,3.2747,3.6744,0.7272,4.7754,1.9626,5.9578,3.9466,1.7121,2.4282,3.8646,3.5067,8.9595,5.3469,1.488,0.2921,3.1435,1.3,6.6135,5.2742,2.121,1.001,3.8492,0.0811,1.0616,4.6732,6.7903,1.6264,3.2356,1.1872,0.41,7.4335,7.2298,1.2127,1.0379,3.4168,5.3213,0.2293,0.1433,4.0941,3.5166,3.569,6.2883,0.591,2.6265,3.5727,0.0509,1.318,0.405,5.6313,0.8456,1.8088,3.4723,1.8059,6.0343,1.812,0.7715,2.0705,3.1138,2.8819,0.0834,0.2706,4.6499,1.9816,2.5484,1.2108,0.5313,2.6593,1.2023,4.4872,0.3823,4.7589,2.9794,0.3905,10.5625,6.3877,2.4708,6.4121,5.0777,1.4519,2.287,4.138,1.9502,2.4775,2.2897,3.5486,1.6021,1.1467,4.2534,3.6278,5.4571,2.9615,1.9525,5.0645,3.5047,4.1125,0.5376,4.4887,1.3922,0.1294,0.5707,5.6642,1.2953,4.8396,7.3601,1.4908,1.3665,2.2015,4.483,2.1894,1.4631,6.4072,3.4945,6.5836,1.1979,0.5399,0.2881,0.9663,2.3119,2.862,5.8793,1.2671,6.4028,2.4819,1.8469,0.5017,1.28,2.0879,2.9752,4.9873,1.3759,0.8011,3.4379,3.2268,3.2478,4.6353,5.9366,2.6431,0.483,4.5508,3.8816,1.0296,1.0298,3.612,2.4704,5.9077,4.7543,0.1876,7.3741,1.6471,1.0725,2.3996,2.5912,3.8987,1.2565,2.2706,4.5475,0.1635,4.8514,0.2364,0.7834,0.2364,5.5104,6.3693,1.1431,5.7548,0.4098,0.9401,2.1709,4.3005,0.9092,3.1018,1.834,2.6196,1.2141,2.0129,4.1719,0.4778,0.1985,0.1329,0.4161,5.7711,4.1824,0.3251,0.024,0.3414,4.6353,0.159,8.4826,5.053,4.326,5.2091,6.4265,2.316,0.0343,7.1653,0.549,4.9859,6.8912,6.0194,3.7545,0.043,0.0885,3.8992,1.6607,6.6937,0.001,1.0862,1.9275,3.4193,3.9547,0.6917,0.5426,1.9716,3.0558,2.3124,6.6742,4.7737,9.5485,0.0016,1.8597,2.3439,0.1933,0.8843,4.8369,3.4579,0.2768,3.7322,5.314,7.189,0.2378,1.4224,1.9144,0.1219,0.7658,2.4135,2.9388,3.5264,0.6547,0.5036,4.2227,4.9883,1.2392,3.5356,4.0265,1.5904,2.0955,2.8052,5.1629,0.5935,0.0412,0.5281,1.9498,0.0002,4.9969,3.096,1.0249,6.1711,9.572,5.4139,1.4129,5.3166,3.298,0.7971,2.6057,4.7085,4.3923,4.3396,0.7372]}

If you want to talk more about loans I would like to, but I won't be able to do it for a while.\nWell now you're talking to the wrong guy, but thank you.","token_len":404,"entropy":[2.5476,5.5301,0.0327,3.6555,0.1979,8.0503,8.7255,1.2693,9.606,2.5465,8.0259,6.0081,7.0227,0.6402,2.2106,7.798,3.2671,0.0008,1.2886,3.9683,1.4477,2.085,0.0005,3.6516,2.8697,1.8032,6.8756,6.5364,5.6302,3.1223,5.2581,0.7455,9.5709,3.1647,9.2268,2.2557,0.7883,5.522,0.3605,2.6703,4.6408,2.705,4.1317,0.9186,1.5081,1.6587,1.6478,0.0012,1.5444,0.7659,0.543,5.3508,1.2969,1.6497,4.673,1.9788,1.3582,2.9659,0.8774,3.828,3.1088,8.2928,3.6769,5.4208,7.153,4.6378,2.1983,2.7377,1.3742,3.6242,0.0552,3.4007,1.7716,0.8444,4.907,2.004,5.9205,1.8321,6.6081,7.4849,0.2442,2.9701,1.7392,2.0416,5.3156,0.6516,1.1436,5.3109,2.8121,2.2462,2.4877,6.07,4.197,1.5761,0.0407,1.9279,1.2243,1.4047,3.4132,3.8782,0.377,6.0,3.3583,0.037,0.8068,11.3047,3.2908,11.6504,3.7164,0.779,1.5597,2.1721,7.2133,0.5305,3.9024,2.4357,1.0258,4.4331,6.4193,2.631,3.9385,1.924,1.5703,1.4857,1.081,3.8764,4.339,0.6501,1.0971,6.5427,1.6199,3.4851,3.9078,2.6413,4.5025,0.6739,2.0703,0.7235,3.3665,0.0004,2.3124,0.2787,4.5075,2.6798,1.9164,0.3128,0.9024,7.5696,5.4096,1.3947,1.6853,2.7376,0.8343,5.8164,4.9316,0.806,2.0153,0.8258,5.5268,0.8236,0.3126,3.9498,0.4674,8.5137,3.8762,0.0191,0.3398,3.052,0.709,0.4148,2.4256,5.8483,4.1288,1.4287,6.4699,3.822,3.443,5.1162,5.9093,4.6179,2.9323,3.4271,6.2014,3.4468,1.7115,1.245,4.6719,6.264,1.195,2.0442,1.9968,4.9512,3.3427,1.1017,4.4541,2.64,0.0083,2.3031,2.8056,3.4245,2.6048,0.227,1.995,1.3791,1.4782,2.5685,1.2633,1.5567,2.8851,4.4183,1.4648,4.8339,5.5634,4.6533,1.8853,2.4179,6.2544,1.9536,2.3128,4.3833,1.6224,2.8472,0.0005,3.2077,2.2636,0.629,1.1208,1.0621,4.2036,3.6861,3.277,3.451,3.2385,0.8706,4.6441,0.325,0.0493,0.8935,0.4783,0.8358,2.8587,0.0008,7.2905,1.1213,2.04,1.9025,0.8801,1.9872,6.3895,0.8227,3.6338,1.7172,2.973,3.2266,6.4772,1.9391,0.7505,1.7753,1.8146,3.6299,5.7222,4.7204,1.643,1.9391,2.9388,0.7252,1.8532,1.5689,0.6961,0.9674,5.5569,1.8601,0.234,2.9142,3.0053,0.6503,1.0757,5.545,7.0939,6.6881,0.2461,3.8962,2.6295,5.3939,1.7172,2.9316,2.0737,5.2662,4.1963,3.9201,2.8065,0.77,2.4681,3.8196,0.0325,4.9137,1.7047,0.3733,0.686,0.8573,9.8825,3.3112,1.1253,4.3334,1.3443,2.8591,1.6074,1.8984,8.1947,6.8544,0.7778,4.1691,4.4069,3.0521,2.7961,2.8574,2.8292,6.9555,2.1839,1.9905,1.3202,0.3639,4.6997,3.6353,4.362,1.4817,1.2195,4.5639,6.652,9.5043,2.3975,2.9427,4.0837,1.2712,1.0679,0.1403,2.3211,1.1495,5.3259,2.8286,1.9492,0.9629,5.0172,2.2124,0.3689,8.9065,2.3323,3.0414,5.1004,4.5952,3.8651,2.2623,6.0776,4.7503,1.4815,4.5053,2.5746,2.2367,3.1599,3.6733,3.4705,0.4663,3.7301,0.3932,2.5104,0.3931,6.3701,5.5226,0.2855,6.1128,2.4697,0.9212,3.2512,0.1401,7.1594,0.7006,1.0616,4.7184,0.0004,2.2477,0.6152,0.023,2.8902,1.5809,1.7745,1.2492,0.7309,0.5684,0.4204,4.6192,4.9065,1.6768,1.9178,3.7133,2.9318,2.7518,4.5435,2.7335,1.6276,2.9059,7.2721,0.2433,2.0839]}

Consequently, a large anti-magic field was put in place over two thousand years ago, erasing magical power, and with it, humanity's hopes for galactic conquest. Today, it has worn off.\n\nThe Federation, a new alien race, seeks to conquer the galaxy by gaining the trust and admiration of the galaxy's other sentient races, hoping they'll hand over their planets and resources in exchange for \"favored status\" with the Federation.\n\nOne day, the Federation's star-ship encounters a young girl who may hold the key, in the form of powerful magic that will help the federation to achieve and maintain its goals.\n\nMeanwhile, Tania, a talented mage who also possesses similar powers, is the subject of rumors that she will become the new Empress because... She is female?\n\nThe story follows Tania, who has become a hero to a galaxy of oppressed women, as she struggles to prove her abilities to a galaxy ruled by male dominance, sexism and greed.\n\nThe story is set in both a male and female perspective.\n\nIn addition to the main story line, you can also enjoy a collection of side stories, or just play the free mini game that I created for the purpose. ( It's the second thing in the Extras menu :o )\n\nA new anime, \"Rising of the Shield Hero\", was just released recently, and it's going to be a hit, judging by how popular the novels already are. To celebrate its new release and to promote the anime, I decided to release a new visual of the main character. His name is Albedo. He's... unusual-looking, but a very fun character. I've also decided to release a special version of the story, \"Rising of the Shield Hero\", this year. It will also be adapted into an anime later this year.

Following up his best-selling biography of Billy Joel, Ron Chernow offers here an astute and deeply researched view of the music as not only a genre of its own but as a portal to a profound and enduring cultural tradition.\n\nBilly Joel was the New York City-born son of Russian Jewish immigrants, raised by his parents and their family in small-town Yonkers.

Unfortunately, you may have to turn around and go back to school before you even enjoy summer vacation.\n\nYou had your first class, everything seemed to be working right and all your classmates seemed polite enough. But you're just that curious, so you decided to sign up for a private study session with the tutoring and tutorial services in the library.\n\nYou took that introductory psychology course like it was nobody's business. And although you feel quite accomplished with all the hard work you've done over the past week, you're still a bit wary about the next course you take in that discipline. In fact, you want to make sure that it's not just another easy class that you could have breezed through with your existing knowledge.\n\nIn that regard, we have some fantastic courses available for you to choose from. The Psychology Course Catalog, by the way, can be found by following the links on this page.\n\nIt may seem like this isn't so surprising when you consider the number of times your library friends would remind you that getting lost is a very important life skill, but you'd be surprised to know that for the average student it's still one that gets pretty poorly executed.","token_len":409,"entropy":[5.7785,2.9091,2.9669,0.8765,3.7866,2.6745,5.6339,0.6525,0.2904,0.7248,9.8055,6.4161,5.6749,0.0124,1.5449,1.784,8.4084,1.2347,2.2794,1.7312,3.6474,9.9348,5.3399,0.5716,4.5279,5.5629,0.0006,1.9171,0.9356,1.8628,1.5776,1.5066,0.1697,3.2523,5.6711,0.2005,1.2159,4.7962,0.3268,8.1169,0.9061,1.987,0.1265,0.3326,4.6836,1.5196,0.0923,0.9733,9.1953,1.8785,3.4682,4.8098,5.9269,0.0026,0.3214,2.5433,0.065,5.3712,0.7102,6.3095,0.5053,1.7101,0.0004,3.3263,3.7658,5.5673,1.7917,6.6366,5.7903,1.6543,6.315,2.7804,1.4301,4.6365,8.5667,2.8351,0.6351,6.8493,3.3468,2.3496,1.3557,2.1762,6.644,3.6307,1.054,2.5545,7.1229,0.2718,5.2693,6.4221,3.7944,0.5483,9.3671,0.5816,1.952,4.7568,6.357,1.1599,4.7008,0.9116,0.9995,1.7783,1.7313,1.0372,4.7617,3.7163,7.5905,2.9162,0.9109,7.0721,1.8646,6.0801,1.1876,5.4979,3.4015,5.6173,0.0169,2.7027,2.0133,3.2354,1.2368,0.0962,0.7264,1.3015,0.0002,5.1549,1.6663,0.7931,0.9255,4.6346,0.5847,2.6167,4.3092,0.0227,6.4352,5.4962,1.8834,0.0182,4.4386,5.4906,3.1319,5.306,4.025,0.4861,0.2206,4.2183,0.3298,5.0397,2.8515,3.4869,7.094,7.3392,3.4515,4.5685,1.915,3.3083,1.7008,5.224,0.2135,2.7258,2.6475,2.5797,2.7849,3.8631,0.947,5.5367,0.7098,2.1485,2.4824,1.2923,0.907,5.9344,2.7088,0.7903,2.4106,0.7925,0.2995,1.6328,4.586,0.7846,4.4009,7.8027,5.8273,1.5238,0.5076,1.157,0.0002,3.7904,6.283,2.3467,0.7615,4.2128,2.8544,7.998,2.3353,0.669,0.2354,3.1553,4.3052,1.6918,3.7939,1.551,5.0303,2.0072,8.3846,2.8126,0.8938,2.3721,2.1185,2.7429,3.9695,6.2068,4.6775,3.0419,1.7533,1.3933,3.1492,0.1498,6.5248,0.1671,0.4546,1.4265,4.158,4.4527,4.1071,2.6244,2.1708,6.5861,0.9406,4.1707,7.9919,3.7198,4.3889,1.8046,1.8063,0.278,1.2034,0.0001,2.2148,4.4759,4.5867,5.0483,7.1876,0.9102,7.1653,3.1968,0.7694,7.5187,0.6162,0.1311,1.1811,3.2031,5.7328,0.7553,6.3517,4.8917,6.2453,3.1276,3.9105,1.5906,6.0031,0.0372,1.2161,0.4114,1.4928,3.1941,0.0823,1.5105,4.6265,0.405,0.6839,1.6392,0.7802,2.2641,1.7952,6.0054,1.7295,1.8175,5.4629,2.9026,1.853,1.4324,3.4356,4.3125,4.883,0.1774,4.6346,1.0305,0.1043,0.7869,4.4713,0.1822,3.4101,0.0796,1.6306,3.4435,0.5814,2.0789,1.9294,4.3754,6.5821,2.9157,3.3547,0.7086,6.2492,4.2485,11.319,0.0644,0.1072,2.5453,1.5163,6.4373,3.1237,0.5469,0.6116,0.0001,3.7436,3.429,3.6633,0.1574,2.3948,3.1799,2.4794,6.8035,4.5879,2.408,1.692,0.6444,0.5274,2.2915,0.0316,0.5443,2.9341,8.0655,2.8834,8.4026,3.4876,3.8777,2.2699,0.1135,0.0947,4.6187,0.5314,0.6696,4.8553,6.0698,0.7523,0.7902,2.2968,2.0681,0.1802,0.3147,0.8409,0.0001,4.3942,4.422,1.4106,0.7716,4.1213,4.3692,0.0002,4.5866,4.4426,2.9586,0.2453,2.4994,1.8268,3.3443,0.0085,4.2861,3.5593,5.1499,7.6579,5.3131,6.5713,0.0105,1.7048,7.5508,6.6711,2.8374,1.4458,3.6484,2.7415,5.2235,1.5901,2.3933,0.2804,2.773,4.0867,0.5282,3.0544,3.332,1.6005,0.3353,5.628,2.6339,3.0336,2.1915,2.0187,0.7533,4.64,3.4768,3.9838,4.7249,6.5088,8.4306,7.5369,0.3226]}
{"id":1633,"ended":true,"length":365,"text":"Describe a world of magic that runs on math... not on the whims of the gods.\n\nThe Science of Reality\n\nA young wizard steps up to face the challenge of mastering the science of reality-a realm once inhabited by only the most powerful mages of his generation-and he is joined by a cast of supporting characters whose personal journeys lead them to a common fate. Together, the two are forced to overcome a world of magic and technology that runs by the rules of mathematics\u2026or not.\n\nIn this groundbreaking work from one of modern fiction\u2019s most talented storytellers, The Science of Reality weaves a compelling world as old as time to explore the idea of how we live, think and behave as a species.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nThe Science of Reality is a beautiful science fiction novel in the style of Philip K. Dick. At the core of the novel lies the premise that math is the defining force of our reality, that everything we see in the world depends on what has come before us, and that everything and every person in the world depends on how the human being as a species matures; which means that the only thing that will truly matter in the long run is how we deal with death. In short, how do you take your chances at survival? It is a very poignant and beautiful look at society and how we deal with it.\n\n~ William J. Hughes\n\nFantasy literature does not always challenge the reader to think and act in a new way. Few fantasy novels have the intelligence, wit and erudition that The Science of Reality displays. The author weaves complex ideas into a fascinating, thought-provoking story.\n\n~ Scott M. Fife\n\nThis is science fiction as it should be read. This book has the right mix of depth, humanity and imagination to make it truly stand out amid it contemporaries. No matter how hard sci-fi and dystopia sell, nothing is likely to be as good as this.","token_len":409,"entropy":[8.2919,2.5971,6.1476,2.4773,5.2801,2.4327,6.3888,1.7582,8.6871,6.1087,6.1475,4.3934,3.5387,6.6506,0.0495,2.2696,2.255,1.0501,1.2697,0.0306,2.8013,7.032,1.1301,6.4943,0.8255,0.0003,3.2343,5.9271,4.164,7.4622,3.5904,0.2601,6.5302,1.1685,4.6049,0.1737,5.3684,1.1983,3.6166,0.0433,0.4043,7.9284,4.5154,4.4611,7.0076,4.6439,0.1735,4.8476,2.0274,0.9298,1.9587,4.1159,2.6952,2.8534,1.7466,5.8768,0.8225,2.5529,2.5356,3.7594,0.0878,1.4819,5.6906,0.008,7.4875,0.5055,4.384,6.2284,4.1211,3.3898,0.617,0.6231,3.0217,5.4532,5.8581,0.5733,5.8899,0.7547,2.2158,2.9907,4.661,2.4364,0.165,4.8676,2.1713,3.0176,1.3264,1.8997,1.6764,5.4115,0.6955,5.6539,6.2205,1.3759,2.2177,0.1665,3.5279,5.7066,5.129,3.4995,0.3487,0.485,0.0003,4.1556,1.9765,4.8088,4.5706,2.8209,5.7383,0.0483,6.0426,3.4871,17.0866,7.2871,5.6409,1.0338,3.6657,5.2714,0.0751,0.0047,0.3201,4.2881,0.2414,0.0168,0.0075,7.5695,5.443,2.2869,3.3411,3.321,6.2515,5.938,0.1657,0.9119,4.0963,4.0363,0.9794,6.0827,0.4229,3.7783,3.0685,3.1308,1.609,3.2514,1.2937,3.2502,3.4012,2.5666,2.4559,0.715,1.5637,0.0002,4.6248,7.2536,2.7367,0.134,0.8823,0.0003,3.4493,0.7676,0.0244,0.0079,0.6904,1.1813,4.5918,5.2341,0.654,1.1981,4.7406,2.5711,2.6184,0.1974,5.9891,0.2217,0.1143,0.0,1.5045,6.3243,1.8779,2.1338,0.106,1.0703,2.2966,3.1584,1.0709,3.939,1.1674,5.049,0.8884,1.9581,6.2732,1.7986,1.0592,1.8488,2.6182,1.3632,2.7712,3.8013,0.9207,2.8633,2.9543,0.9916,0.7328,5.841,0.2282,3.5987,6.6829,4.8072,0.0319,2.2933,1.7508,0.7504,0.1934,2.6582,5.8944,3.4758,4.2204,1.6157,1.3038,0.5931,4.5411,0.1406,3.0385,3.5107,5.6623,2.9757,6.3816,0.7074,2.813,7.486,0.0152,6.8766,5.3248,2.929,0.464,2.46,4.0601,2.3036,0.8336,3.7433,3.2394,2.3688,1.7836,1.1367,2.8952,0.1826,0.233,1.6318,1.1222,5.0399,0.004,8.0971,1.1594,3.9796,3.659,0.1538,4.5392,3.1854,1.7808,5.9497,2.4912,5.9312,3.9194,1.6903,1.2137,4.7149,1.9158,1.667,3.7952,7.5895,1.7005,4.0522,5.4289,0.3541,7.2933,1.8813,2.2641,1.4238,3.11,0.0037,1.7125,0.4059,0.3992,0.0003,8.5986,5.5638,4.2733,0.0843,7.8633,1.1091,0.0003,5.8061,2.2918,8.3897,5.945,0.5689,2.045,8.0118,1.1808,4.7346,1.9757,2.7991,3.7917,1.4693,1.2472,1.1119,3.7039,0.232,0.5581,7.4452,4.4826,1.3388,1.8551,3.536,7.9093,1.7354,2.0792,0.4516,7.9085,0.0221,0.0725,2.7471,5.2225,0.0104,0.0104,0.0032,6.07,0.3685,2.2569,3.6842,7.7687,0.0172,4.7119,4.1264,1.9432,1.1078,5.4068,2.3405,5.7073,0.3418,0.0163,0.0002,1.837,2.4332,1.6388,0.0002,2.2447,5.3719,4.3921,0.3091,5.7702,6.3903,0.2399,0.0002,3.0934,1.2711,6.1526,0.049,3.9472,1.8035,3.6588,0.0143,8.0076,0.7929,3.4834,2.0969,3.3203,2.3783,5.3941,3.2962,0.0106,5.2654,0.7962,6.5248,0.78,3.8311,1.6219,2.1157,1.9627,4.127,3.399,0.0928,9.2025,7.2752,13.6879,0.3589,6.1635,1.2802,1.1216,3.3175,8.4407,0.0354,0.0007,3.5809,8.9875,1.0229,8.569,0.4535,6.3788,2.3693,6.3281,0.0135,2.8076,1.7319,2.7418,0.4701,1.8266,1.9403]}

Conversation ensues.\nEach dinner guest says, \"You know... I've been meaning to ask... why, exactly, are we still traveling through time?\"\n\nIt's just time related, like when you talk about \"moving\" across a room, or \"running\" over a street, or \"flying\" up to heaven. If you put everything down and just \"wait\", it will be less of a rush, if that makes sense. Some people have things that they can \"do\", but I'm only allowed to travel through time! :)\n\nIf that makes sense, and isn't too confusing for you as to what I just said... then you may just be at the age where you need to slow down and really let a situation unfold. Just \"take your time\" and relax and see where the road leads you.\n\nYou can choose to use that time you have in more than one way. I would suggest taking time to slow down with your thinking. If you spend a good bit of time focusing on everything and every thing in your life and on how the world around you affects you, how much better you feel.\n\nAnd that's just what I'm doing. I spend time on my daydreams. If it makes you feel better at all to write things down that might be on your mind right now, write them down. I just use my journal for that. I don't do this too much, but when I do, that's the purpose. :0)\n\nIf you need something to think about, then start by thinking of a \"g\" and how you could put this on a t-shirt and wear it.

Because your dead, your not there.  And because souls are, by definition, supernatural, it's impossible to \"love eachother\".  Edit: Also by that logic, once you're dead, you won't care about anyone.\n> Edit: Also by that logic, once you're dead, you won't care about anyone.  Well, yeah. I'm not really making the claim that people think differently after they come back, just that their thought process during their *final* moments on earth is quite different than how they usually are (I understand that's sort of a stretch).\nThat would make sense,but then what would make people so afraid to die then?\nIf you're talking about people being afraid of killing their own, that fear goes away once they realize you're dead, you're dead forever, what's the point of wasting energy worrying about it\nI guess what I'm trying to get at is that their attitude will change. If it didn't, then maybe there's something that we could learn from them when they're dead.\nMaybe their thought process just suddenly got really, really weird right before they died. Or maybe they felt completely at ease with that weirdness (like they were used to the idea or something)\nThat would be sad.\nAt the same time though, it's kind of interesting. Like, if you die and then you find out later on that some insane entity just took over your body and did what it wanted with it for a while, it would be like going through the worst of hell on earth for the purpose of it all, just to then be let off the hook.","token_len":415,"entropy":[7.6058,0.5278,2.5762,12.256,1.715,0.4825,1.0417,9.1662,0.4116,6.3874,0.0945,1.4067,4.4162,0.754,4.3731,0.6712,2.6668,3.44,0.8059,2.6606,2.0286,5.9265,3.5961,0.0545,1.736,4.7645,0.53,7.6448,10.9948,4.452,5.6177,3.483,2.1315,8.4174,2.6561,1.5321,1.0087,4.6579,4.5804,6.1795,1.3188,1.987,5.3958,1.1362,2.0079,4.2731,1.8509,1.405,0.4434,4.5937,1.2311,2.2701,0.8528,0.3723,7.1423,1.1373,0.0128,5.6007,0.5137,2.7752,4.4361,5.2443,4.3613,2.7443,2.9376,3.7964,6.9245,0.132,0.8944,6.3062,3.4124,6.684,2.7392,3.7769,1.7818,3.6373,0.0067,1.2346,0.4449,5.5001,3.7645,7.2451,5.5341,3.3638,6.8982,6.4956,2.4464,2.0859,5.5444,2.9474,7.2277,1.0939,5.8213,3.4859,2.6838,0.0512,8.3322,1.5328,3.5671,2.3815,3.2134,1.1484,4.655,4.7582,4.5738,5.9384,2.8036,0.9487,9.3964,0.8155,4.7631,6.2453,5.1376,2.0745,0.4456,6.5242,0.7186,2.5881,0.5059,0.5146,0.9253,3.6568,0.0008,4.5151,1.2486,3.6849,2.1201,2.647,8.9628,7.9638,0.1091,2.4855,0.5872,0.0684,0.0035,0.0275,0.0516,0.0043,0.0128,0.0049,0.0068,0.0099,0.015,0.0001,0.0045,0.0028,0.0239,0.014,3.5993,7.1009,0.4047,5.1323,1.6307,2.541,2.0045,1.8039,3.3999,6.1432,3.5714,3.9987,0.4573,4.6474,4.9429,7.773,5.1884,2.162,6.3928,0.5127,1.9629,3.623,1.1197,4.5555,6.7176,0.7717,6.1141,1.3233,9.3255,5.8084,0.4271,4.4926,5.4798,0.5686,0.782,5.3594,0.1902,2.0731,3.8882,1.1165,5.0822,3.0751,4.6285,3.7069,5.9181,1.1737,3.4669,5.9364,0.0942,1.3618,4.3576,2.0182,1.4665,4.2258,4.5641,2.9176,1.2954,1.4895,10.0846,3.4274,3.9657,3.0216,2.1822,4.0328,4.4387,6.3165,2.2043,4.0491,6.4119,0.8947,1.1775,3.7249,1.0881,1.8181,4.5745,0.1512,2.9254,3.2863,1.5778,0.8852,5.5262,3.0755,1.7509,5.772,3.1084,6.4304,4.7811,1.2843,4.9043,0.5674,4.0931,2.9823,0.6509,0.9427,1.3674,3.8116,1.867,1.6076,4.6083,0.9725,5.941,1.947,1.0173,0.4262,0.877,7.5035,4.571,5.9676,0.1808,3.7206,8.525,2.8628,3.27,3.8649,0.8877,0.4222,1.3192,0.005,4.5193,0.2433,0.4037,0.7182,6.6556,6.4101,5.5111,1.123,2.7811,2.9104,3.8375,5.1545,0.0004,0.5658,1.4459,3.2412,3.2623,1.8192,1.9764,3.1572,4.1089,2.4468,2.4724,0.268,1.6506,5.1941,0.71,2.071,1.3275,0.7794,1.2926,4.0454,4.4227,4.4284,0.3739,6.0022,7.4031,3.9846,4.5773,2.9748,0.1137,3.292,6.0072,2.6529,0.432,1.8379,0.8177,3.7523,0.2132,0.7575,4.9456,4.7222,3.3549,1.1442,1.682,3.7792,5.9457,1.9056,4.6301,3.1549,1.6106,1.4852,6.1125,0.0125,3.2693,2.3006,7.5714,2.1443,1.9422,2.1125,3.3272,2.3483,1.1912,6.2923,1.3128,1.2021,5.8678,1.6486,1.4605,0.0087,4.2819,0.1552,2.4166,1.214,3.4024,0.0026,2.2925,3.499,5.0015,1.4243,2.1955,1.1688,4.5937,2.2388,2.7956,1.07,4.4039,0.7041,4.9529,1.5837,0.5467,5.5895,8.0072,5.4634,4.7335,4.057,1.9676,0.8775,0.9588,1.0658,5.0087,2.9111,2.8159,2.4772,2.699,0.6258,4.8852,1.633,1.1365,0.4794,2.726,1.9033,0.9317,2.526,5.4471,2.3717,2.024,6.8266,1.9226,3.9756,4.8784,1.9944,2.9385,2.704,7.1431,0.0138,6.7701,4.71,2.4144,3.7581,0.9923,6.5213,2.3683,6.2941,3.5183,0.4621,0.0046,0.8855]}

The book is written in Ballard's distinctive \"novel-within-a-novel'' technique, with long paragraphs that describe the various characters and their situations, which, like Ballard's fiction in general, is rich in the interplay between facts and invented details; one of Ballard's major themes, present in most of his work, is the relationship between the reality of the human condition and the vision of the writer. \"In Ballard's writing the past and the future become intimately interlinked; the present and the future are similarly linked, only of an other, strange parallel dimension\" (from the introduction to On the Beach ). \"He ( Ballard ) has the uncanny ability to place characters in a time and space so that the reader can see the parallels in the way that past and present have become indistinguishable and at the same time so completely different from each other that the future seems almost as elusive as the past\" (from the author's note, 'JG Ballard : Retrospect', 1991 ).","token_len":419,"entropy":[7.3022,10.835,0.4334,7.0354,2.231,3.4786,2.5811,6.6434,4.7798,1.0443,3.9759,1.0461,5.3228,4.37,0.4761,4.6079,1.0105,7.3191,0.0994,0.9329,7.3721,0.2127,1.0939,7.8206,0.455,3.12,1.0811,2.7705,0.0235,3.7488,0.9682,0.6905,4.9547,2.0793,6.3199,2.9163,3.88,0.9281,6.8874,6.538,6.9636,1.0091,5.4099,8.2962,12.5768,1.0036,6.6513,8.9085,6.0979,2.68,4.4588,2.6069,0.0825,2.0746,6.5649,1.6012,6.4347,1.9527,0.2849,6.1814,8.5764,0.4314,1.2599,7.3256,0.3484,4.9065,6.6181,1.656,0.9117,3.3788,0.0305,5.3905,2.7273,0.0204,8.3932,2.1921,1.7626,6.2845,2.0493,0.6423,4.033,0.536,1.9367,8.7869,0.8706,0.2217,0.1186,0.417,1.1209,7.4143,6.8591,0.5302,4.4176,4.1289,3.9481,2.6009,3.0854,4.248,10.1761,3.8104,5.4106,4.2939,7.0821,5.95,0.7879,1.5589,9.2087,9.0245,1.0993,0.4499,1.3292,1.3146,6.7416,0.8495,1.5042,9.3447,4.2841,0.3093,4.3503,1.1173,1.143,5.9291,7.8164,0.1858,7.0126,1.4954,1.3932,2.1018,2.0362,2.1894,1.5459,4.9578,0.7415,1.1494,1.1686,4.4607,0.3203,9.4485,3.4522,4.2214,4.7161,0.5223,2.9668,3.9892,3.1007,4.7067,0.5928,4.4362,0.0702,1.9745,3.7143,1.9853,8.3734,0.1318,1.8092,1.2006,6.4009,0.0595,0.6098,1.0601,0.0004,1.8469,7.0814,3.0369,1.3816,5.6658,1.728,7.9909,2.1611,0.3684,3.0837,1.7224,4.2781,1.4586,6.0538,3.1953,5.2306,7.4661,2.7927,1.3661,7.7823,4.5762,2.2756,9.0102,0.6111,2.737,5.7141,1.6693,0.8046,1.975,6.5017,0.2424,0.6719,1.6227,4.0233,1.8669,0.8547,7.8164,1.4586,2.7887,3.7051,5.2769,5.1078,5.5488,1.538,1.0468,7.2938,3.4845,0.1433,6.5986,0.0528,1.3935,2.1739,2.0954,1.7952,3.7145,0.3408,2.1056,2.0296,1.0945,3.2056,1.6217,6.1268,0.1327,4.1395,5.4867,4.5378,0.7496,3.3635,6.1207,0.1042,0.4585,0.0046,1.1228,0.0015,8.891,7.9486,0.7969,2.1929,6.4801,3.9434,2.619,4.4956,1.1911,3.5726,2.1726,1.3159,1.8221,4.3826,1.3774,4.3101,4.1764,3.4339,2.2646,0.057,4.5932,5.0058,0.8,0.0257,2.0838,6.0132,1.0957,4.6818,5.9119,0.3253,0.9714,5.9508,0.3044,9.523,4.3411,4.9909,4.7201,1.5375,1.3654,0.003,4.1145,2.3987,2.9296,9.1687,1.1343,4.069,1.0324,0.3593,2.3069,0.1288,0.078,0.818,3.7393,0.0943,1.5566,6.2769,0.5091,1.5231,2.4466,1.2574,0.2155,0.5208,6.9509,0.2234,1.0123,7.7002,1.1495,3.9808,3.5892,2.7078,0.1949,3.6212,3.524,6.7422,2.9918,0.9304,0.4945,4.9966,4.9682,3.0685,2.1501,3.4791,1.6571,2.2706,2.9969,0.0967,0.28,1.2658,8.5518,2.5358,1.9255,6.1693,5.5494,3.9692,7.258,3.7734,7.612,6.3859,5.4891,4.3451,0.3877,6.5891,2.5826,4.0485,1.3982,7.2459,1.0977,5.9273,3.8467,2.9232,3.646,6.9004,1.0322,0.1521,2.654,4.0486,4.2553,0.2784,0.122,4.9038,5.1169,0.9359,1.8267,4.7732,1.2648,3.0467,3.7636,3.0241,2.8683,1.3822,1.3628,2.207,2.0994,6.3199,2.6884,1.6352,3.897,2.056,6.4333,0.7077,1.1636,3.8808,3.5123,6.4508,3.0801,5.3161,0.6417,0.01,0.0028,3.984,3.8057,1.396,2.7947,0.8496,0.0089,0.5229,1.8848,5.5536,3.6323,3.4,2.7709,7.4622,0.5833,0.2322,0.3111,2.395,0.0464,0.8266,0.9848,6.0121,0.1668,6.416,3.4275,5.2003,5.1863,0.9575,0.0522,5.2508,7.7598,3.3942,3.2684,6.5067,4.3985]}
{"id":1628,"ended":true,"length":372,"text":"Upon being introduced to the Galactic Alliance, we find out a perverse truth : Humanity is actually the sanest species in the galaxy.\n\nThe Federation is a collection of planets ruled by a single species, who control the galaxy. It is the galaxy's largest power, and is an absolute monarchy, much like the Terran Empire of Earth-A. A Galactic Alliance is founded, with the intent of removing the Galactic Federation from the universe.[1]\n\nG.U.S.O.N.\n\nThe Galactic United States of New Nalbana was a Federation member state which became independent in 2274. It was located in the northern part of the Core worlds.\n\nThe United States and the Confederacy clashed often as both considered themselves to be superior. The Confederacy eventually invaded parts of the United States after the U.S. refused to negotiate and instead demanded that they retreat to the Core worlds.[1] Ultimately, the U.S. was victorious.[1]\n\nGALNet\n\nIn 2285, a corporation known as \"Gulacorp\" was active on the planet Earth A. The corporation, which had previously been active on Earth and on Earth B, was in a dispute with the Galactic Federation over control of Earth A, and was attempting to use terrorist tactics to get what they wanted\u2014control of Earth A. Because the Galactic Federation refused to negotiate, the corporation turned its attention to a more powerful Alliance member: the Galactic United States of New Nalbana. Thus the corporation began to build a network to allow the corporation to attack both the Galactic Federal Forces (such as the Interrogation Corps) as well as the United States government. The corporation built a network of automated systems which would then be activated if either the Galactic Federation or the U.S. attacked Earth A, and which would cause as much as possible destruction.[1] This program was known as 'GALNet', and is similar to the Black Network which was used by the Sith Lords to gain control of the Galactic Republic in the Old Republic Era.","token_len":419,"entropy":[6.1256,4.4974,0.9298,1.375,6.9752,2.4307,0.8106,6.3602,4.7612,2.0675,3.9287,11.7949,3.2502,8.8161,7.2126,1.0214,5.2414,2.9839,11.5685,0.6276,2.3212,1.3967,0.2837,0.1055,0.6486,2.2142,0.0411,2.4278,4.4551,1.9512,2.2508,5.9231,0.0073,4.6993,6.5489,0.0791,1.2895,1.683,5.3205,1.2098,4.1056,5.0368,1.5826,2.1697,2.2889,3.596,0.7596,1.9819,4.2151,0.5803,2.7577,5.5744,1.3218,0.9303,2.6683,5.0084,3.7433,2.7611,2.1783,6.8165,0.1918,0.6607,7.9729,0.4187,3.1954,5.7605,4.4319,6.368,0.8329,4.4982,5.9428,1.3778,1.6736,3.857,2.8558,2.7282,1.0002,4.2041,0.38,6.2422,0.8585,3.163,4.0442,0.4857,0.727,4.4763,5.3852,1.5957,0.113,0.3644,0.0002,6.4412,5.4117,6.0163,0.0765,2.1292,0.1312,4.1462,0.3076,3.6925,0.3879,2.2254,0.0002,1.624,1.6838,6.1825,2.2203,1.4486,10.5195,5.8345,5.9608,8.5594,4.9961,2.5591,3.0439,4.2804,5.3098,3.181,4.6666,3.348,3.6264,1.2269,3.8636,7.2057,1.0289,2.0411,1.1074,4.6905,1.0732,0.5059,4.6565,1.5987,0.002,0.347,6.8674,5.2584,3.5673,1.4272,0.0002,1.9552,2.5052,0.3407,5.1788,1.3594,4.8062,9.1953,5.2112,4.4618,4.5318,5.7267,2.2639,1.2655,0.0394,4.8309,2.8754,1.6146,2.6509,4.6879,6.0918,6.4457,0.0026,0.5671,2.4135,0.02,4.6537,0.7708,4.2241,0.0526,0.0107,0.039,4.2914,0.1505,4.6513,4.4269,4.8217,5.2992,1.5623,3.3264,6.8538,1.2643,1.1539,2.0913,0.5806,2.7299,1.0139,0.0523,7.0732,0.2378,0.5566,2.3444,0.0013,0.0009,0.0468,2.9594,4.6047,3.6148,1.1709,0.0469,0.1453,0.0001,3.6695,5.4031,11.075,1.4081,0.0001,2.9779,1.0953,2.7028,0.1708,2.4196,6.6507,2.5899,0.0184,3.8058,1.1813,7.1168,6.1931,3.9671,0.523,1.5154,6.6692,2.4176,0.8297,1.4108,4.1642,6.3396,1.6208,3.4486,1.1606,3.5843,1.79,2.1858,3.9868,0.9185,4.5107,0.638,1.3209,3.3892,3.8188,3.4349,2.8042,0.5185,1.2764,4.5828,2.5455,3.9477,0.2558,0.5915,1.4903,1.966,0.635,2.6719,0.343,2.0044,1.3682,2.0454,1.6037,2.3876,3.0625,0.0172,3.4231,12.6394,3.1182,1.1229,3.8302,5.6972,0.7143,1.0583,6.8301,5.0795,0.2609,0.8648,0.8636,0.8136,5.9089,2.131,1.7668,0.5352,3.0201,0.1418,1.7442,0.7331,0.7818,1.3651,5.0508,1.6863,0.386,0.1531,4.0663,4.0224,4.2128,8.1503,3.9688,3.2009,0.5622,1.6196,3.821,0.1607,0.3597,0.071,0.0436,0.0017,0.0067,0.0012,0.5478,7.0398,3.2477,2.8008,3.1012,1.3018,4.4944,1.2597,3.4942,3.9639,6.5086,1.4117,4.8032,0.4873,4.6694,4.6194,1.1947,2.7929,6.6589,5.5746,3.4204,5.8599,0.0294,0.3407,7.119,5.7857,0.7581,3.687,0.7062,3.3245,0.01,0.0025,0.8218,2.4937,0.3621,1.92,0.9165,1.919,1.6815,6.2164,0.8335,2.7175,0.6728,7.33,3.9124,2.9991,2.7031,5.1575,1.9254,3.713,4.0653,5.838,1.4466,1.2706,0.2416,0.2154,0.1828,2.813,0.0005,0.0014,0.0095,5.6247,1.2757,0.7322,2.1436,1.7849,4.7251,0.8561,4.6858,7.4027,0.717,3.3236,4.376,3.368,3.4445,0.2419,0.0384,5.1567,6.4413,0.8263,3.0331,0.0543,5.894,1.2466,4.4798,0.266,1.5956,0.747,3.4618,5.7307,0.2269,0.7887,6.7029,6.2353,3.4408,1.2246,1.8925,0.9584,0.3509,6.1492,3.0799,1.544,4.2135,0.3367,0.2213,0.7031,3.0674,2.5035,3.0023,1.1544,6.2334,0.1453,4.002,0.8605]}
{"id":475,"ended":false,"length":385,"text":"The Day You Found Out Magic Wasn't Real\n\nThe Day You Found Out Magic Wasn't Real is a 2002 novel by Daniel Handler, written under the name Lemony Snicket. It was first published in hardcover by Alfred A. Knopf (a division of Penguin Books) on March 4, 2002, with an initial print run of 1.275 million copies. A mass market paperback edition followed on August 20, 2003 and a British hardback and paperback appeared on June 25, 2004. In 2009, Penguin put out an edition illustrated by Kate Beaton, which includes her illustrations that have appeared in her webcomic Sluggy Freelance.\n\nSynopsis\nThe story of one young boy's discovery that he is \"different\" from most people. \"Magic isn't real.\"\n\nReception\nPublishers Weekly gave the novel a starred review and called it \"a moving, intelligent introduction to a strange world full of cruelty and danger.\" It went on to say, \"The wit and sarcasm are snappy, but the novel isn't intended for the adult crowd (though younger fans will enjoy it). There's plenty of humor in this book, although some will find it in places inappropriate for their age. All in all, though, it's a fun tale, although at times a bit dark.\" Kirkus Reviews gave the novel a positive review and said that it \"isn't without its own share of humor, and as with the other volumes in the series, both kids-turned-adults and grownups alike can savor its tongue in cheek dialogue and sharp observations of society and politics\" and remarked that \" Handler is at his best when dealing with adult themes and ideas.\" The Christian Science Monitor commented that the novel \"is as funny as ever... But don't be fooled: There are some seriously disturbing themes here... The final page of his brilliant tale leaves it all still up in the air. There are still more questions than answers.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \"The Day You Found Out Magic Wasn't Real\" at Goodreads","token_len":424,"entropy":[8.8861,4.4617,4.4782,1.5318,10.3446,7.2869,4.4635,0.0123,4.6829,1.2851,0.0027,2.9812,2.8381,0.1913,0.2076,0.0092,0.0899,0.4065,0.0313,0.0001,0.0214,2.8179,0.9296,8.0997,4.6851,0.6844,5.4227,5.479,1.1158,2.4969,6.023,0.1283,2.0184,9.3615,1.3037,0.0075,0.0001,0.6208,1.0455,1.341,3.2983,0.1568,0.2918,9.4289,0.217,2.1128,8.3067,1.8631,0.0392,0.0162,0.0022,0.0002,3.7484,3.8568,6.328,0.0322,2.5921,1.5278,1.4522,3.5466,2.9273,3.3636,0.0744,0.9087,1.8035,2.9066,2.3049,3.8826,2.5925,0.024,0.1697,3.3947,3.3014,9.3041,0.74,0.4364,0.66,4.2837,8.998,2.2218,0.189,2.8299,3.6505,1.141,3.4582,3.564,0.1129,1.4106,3.5865,1.6188,8.6531,3.8454,2.6083,5.1312,1.7485,6.7487,0.5063,3.7316,3.399,0.0952,0.3858,0.2781,2.988,3.709,0.2537,9.1603,6.2392,0.9188,2.0214,4.4069,9.814,0.2992,8.0099,6.4588,1.0177,1.3099,1.7483,4.042,6.7128,4.5101,5.9264,3.2816,1.7737,0.3623,5.6057,5.9069,0.6942,0.2261,9.7685,2.0667,7.2063,3.645,0.4756,0.8752,0.9507,0.0002,5.8069,0.4004,15.8346,2.9073,2.0703,5.0365,3.5631,2.271,2.6029,3.6701,2.3416,1.9594,1.5424,4.4615,6.158,0.4052,0.482,4.5023,1.5766,3.5006,5.6525,5.6896,4.5941,0.0008,0.866,3.3474,1.1012,0.0002,7.0788,1.1435,0.109,25.5372,0.426,1.6969,3.941,0.8507,0.9459,1.0051,8.2438,0.5071,3.215,3.1309,0.148,0.6571,1.3098,6.3162,0.9185,4.7564,5.8744,0.1618,2.0436,4.3288,2.3403,4.1792,0.0006,8.625,0.5569,4.5759,0.665,3.9142,3.3334,0.0822,0.0166,7.4209,1.2978,0.1202,1.959,8.6679,1.043,7.058,0.015,2.8096,8.8655,0.6117,1.0855,3.6213,0.7925,4.6432,4.6288,0.0007,6.1493,1.7828,1.7257,4.1699,4.9841,4.828,2.8614,7.203,4.0171,2.3573,2.8798,0.9547,2.0522,3.6077,0.7431,3.3699,0.2316,2.1359,1.6556,2.114,1.7419,0.5908,5.422,2.7745,4.7054,1.0051,0.9128,5.878,6.6716,8.5888,2.6704,3.1878,1.4518,1.8405,5.758,1.3092,0.0037,0.0749,3.475,0.0378,0.9915,0.4222,0.5869,3.2882,5.4428,2.5458,6.9803,4.8184,0.7961,2.7789,1.0825,4.1514,1.1889,8.7632,0.5507,0.146,2.3191,0.7983,0.5911,0.44,4.263,0.4042,1.1592,1.6542,2.2922,0.924,1.225,2.5564,3.323,0.0009,5.4045,0.342,2.5725,7.6106,0.0018,3.032,1.3226,1.8869,4.9426,3.0982,2.6799,2.6037,7.6219,1.5573,0.7176,0.3465,0.1783,6.3789,6.9484,5.8341,7.306,0.0285,4.4974,0.0075,2.7767,4.464,2.2653,3.4028,2.6589,8.3073,0.022,3.3833,8.006,3.2548,2.6672,6.3151,1.1821,6.0583,5.1461,2.2156,5.702,2.8564,3.7578,5.1532,1.9048,7.3648,0.9554,1.1901,14.5799,2.733,5.0563,2.1624,0.3118,0.4067,4.9132,0.0161,4.1432,2.4525,1.8862,5.8906,2.1069,3.0522,7.1863,0.133,0.0009,4.1992,0.7901,1.4929,1.1611,0.7466,1.8645,4.2584,3.5484,0.3506,2.8787,4.9055,6.5757,4.8188,0.0004,2.3974,0.8096,1.4107,4.5881,1.4201,2.2898,4.874,3.8225,2.2781,1.9671,4.0039,2.3639,6.749,3.4251,1.417,6.5365,7.6681,3.2235,6.4434,4.9135,2.6138,7.7316,5.5676,0.3763,0.0126,0.0038,2.0534,3.5162,1.5742,3.9422,4.3806,3.6553,1.7047,0.0171,1.6616,1.2034,0.0003,6.0498,1.0534,0.0006,5.7471,0.8917,1.2561,11.3669,2.2082,0.4447,0.0264,0.0019,0.0052,0.0084,0.125,0.0061,0.0001,0.0219,0.697,5.7993,7.044,0.1089]}

His skin color is a bluish-green. He is always seen wearing a light grey suit, green scarf, black dress shoes, and has a black bag on his shoulder. He also speaks English as a second language.\n\nBio : Yamamoto is a genius who has spent most of his life in schools. He always excels in physics and chemistry, but is more interested in physics and chemistry in regards to healing. He was a very prodigy who learned how to heal people his third year in high school with a spell that he made up using chemistry and his magical talents. Since then, he has become a powerful and famous teacher of students. One of his students, Kyuuki Uru, managed to cure a terminal disease in a young boy (Taken with a modified spell from the previous user), although this ability to heal is one that Yamamoto and Uru can use to heal injuries and sickness, not cure them. During his first battle against Kyuuki, which he was victorious at (Kyuuki was forced to retreat), Yamamoto healed Kyuuki from a bullet wound that was meant to kill him. In the following weeks, Uru left the hero group (He left without warning and made many friends with Kyuuki's friends ), and Yamamoto became the sole instructor of the school. After the whole Kyuuki leaving fiasco, Yamamoto left the school to go to a university to learn how to be a doctor.","token_len":424,"entropy":[3.8828,2.7333,10.5306,2.2519,0.0017,8.2604,0.1351,0.6532,5.2677,1.5037,1.6344,10.0717,1.7571,3.5941,3.8594,5.5127,3.447,0.8433,3.0048,7.4996,5.7228,2.5461,2.0551,1.3534,3.9648,3.207,6.8962,0.0001,8.2625,0.3565,0.2351,1.5991,3.4831,0.7306,9.9111,4.1906,1.7,7.6695,9.8082,5.5543,0.8987,4.4365,2.8584,0.2718,1.0853,2.4503,3.9488,0.8896,3.2787,0.1919,4.1771,1.633,6.7683,1.0381,2.583,4.2681,0.2891,1.2371,1.8969,0.0064,8.2398,4.9908,5.6703,5.0152,6.2785,5.4154,7.0131,1.0332,0.434,0.0004,7.2899,0.2162,0.0181,4.7721,0.2119,1.8898,3.9148,5.98,6.8524,2.6835,5.561,1.3488,6.8972,1.03,2.6806,6.0159,2.6446,3.5663,0.1067,0.0002,4.6775,0.4909,0.4905,4.3469,4.7488,0.8929,5.1986,4.9768,6.1399,0.2754,3.4908,1.7968,1.6471,0.8352,0.0002,6.4264,0.1859,2.5895,4.2745,2.5498,6.2101,1.1589,7.717,2.4709,2.1728,3.3947,8.1967,0.0765,2.2869,0.0416,0.9714,1.1063,4.807,1.2738,0.0234,3.8367,4.6513,0.9932,2.2438,3.8946,4.1215,0.4099,2.226,6.607,0.0228,0.9583,2.0273,1.8683,0.9642,2.3133,4.634,5.0014,1.4241,0.8279,4.4707,3.6785,1.5691,1.7396,4.9863,5.2959,0.7838,3.0472,5.0871,2.2479,0.5921,0.8046,7.6578,0.9412,2.9405,4.7891,2.5344,0.1443,3.3047,0.294,1.0359,2.9233,5.1624,3.017,3.0369,1.4118,0.9067,0.0155,0.5065,0.9556,0.0002,5.8347,0.8583,5.1934,0.0161,0.8127,0.7804,5.3008,2.1302,1.7093,3.658,2.6749,0.0124,0.0215,0.5333,2.2723,7.8234,1.3558,0.7507,5.591,8.0447,0.0015,0.9225,5.2395,0.7559,2.1993,1.3604,1.2125,2.4831,3.9577,1.3171,0.01,4.862,1.0742,1.9596,3.5813,6.8527,0.007,7.205,0.995,0.8949,3.2091,2.3617,4.8337,8.796,0.0516,4.0301,3.9491,2.0053,0.016,2.584,2.5743,7.8021,7.8743,1.0357,2.8447,0.9506,0.0358,4.7955,1.6528,5.8971,1.9314,3.1397,4.3861,4.239,3.5906,7.6529,2.2119,3.3201,5.5987,6.6774,0.3094,5.2122,0.6464,0.4637,0.2455,0.4151,2.5442,0.8361,4.6035,2.8386,5.3896,2.766,3.3303,4.3768,1.3985,5.6059,1.0985,0.9075,1.27,1.2906,6.0556,3.0674,6.4035,4.38,5.7523,2.6622,6.6383,0.013,3.766,1.6615,8.9229,1.5445,2.1003,2.3049,5.5494,1.7797,6.1947,4.9501,6.1215,4.2077,1.8977,8.5504,6.51,3.0348,1.7889,5.4803,8.8493,2.3882,5.4814,3.1996,6.3356,5.9126,1.2335,2.2853,5.695,2.4293,4.5754,0.0027,4.067,0.8117,0.0017,3.4552,2.695,1.15,2.0483,7.2886,2.1169,6.0993,3.3746,3.2726,6.34,1.2132,0.4937,5.0231,1.1934,3.2226,5.6411,1.2514,3.2461,0.0408,0.0116,0.3927,6.1199,2.0656,3.035,4.0388,5.1613,4.8933,4.7751,2.0177,0.0036,2.5748,5.7278,0.1094,3.2397,2.8917,1.645,0.0018,5.4537,3.1799,0.0119,0.004,3.764,1.2657,4.4349,0.6206,2.6132,2.3448,6.9208,0.2118,1.1482,0.3237,0.7934,3.4943,1.1308,3.6153,4.6789,0.1614,2.1591,0.001,6.0206,1.693,6.3582,7.6438,4.2331,5.7664,4.7218,5.4842,3.9271,2.4394,5.3374,6.302,1.7849,2.3938,3.9299,0.0338,0.0102,3.0373,1.7602,8.2544,1.2425,2.0402,0.0013,2.832,1.6932,5.1,4.4378,1.154,0.7886,2.6218,1.1272,3.4596,2.1819,8.4498,10.0959,0.104,0.0393,9.4031,8.9825,0.5491,1.9142,0.001,3.1839,1.0615,1.4456,1.7867,2.3706,1.0337,2.4163,4.6348,2.7259,2.754,3.5168,0.0389,3.4572,0.3376,2.9172,0.5193]}
{"id":4359,"ended":true,"length":415,"text":"`` Please God, I 'll do anything... '' you say. And God hears you! Well, not THAT God. A god. And not a god you really want to owe a favor. Because that gods name is Satan. And he doesn't want a favor from you. He doesn't want anything. He will ask for a small thing, just so he can tell you NO when you've begged endlessly. He'll do this repeatedly, sometimes every day, so that you'll end up with nothing at all. And then, somehow,, you will wonder why.\n\nYou see, this devil is smarter than you and he makes you think that you did all this for yourself. And if you had said NO, he would have made sure that there were consequences for it. Because you will have to beg all your life. And what he does is - he lets you do a lot of begging, just so that you'll make the assumption that you are begging him for yourself. Then you stop begging HIM because you will do anything to get what you really want. But you are too late. You've already done so much. And with this little thing you wanted... or had wanted only temporarily - you don't even have that now.\n\nThe devil never tells you that. How could he? You are too blinded by your own wishful thinking as well as by the egoic impulses of your own nature. If he would have told you this, you'd have turned into a monster and destroyed yourself right away. For this reason Satan, unlike God, knows how many of his potential victims turn away when he tells them the truth. That's why he doesn't care a fig about the ones who do.\n\n`` You're not sure now.

Because that gods name is Satan. And he doesn't want a favor from you. He doesn't want anything. He will ask for a small thing, just so he can tell you NO when you've begged endlessly. He'll do this repeatedly, sometimes every day, so that you'll end up with nothing at all. And then, somehow,, you will wonder why.\n\nYou see, this devil is smarter than you and he makes you think that you did all this for yourself. And if you had said NO, he would have made sure that there were consequences for it. Because you will have to beg all your life. And what he does is - he lets you do a lot of begging, just so that you'll make the assumption that you are begging him for yourself. Then you stop begging HIM because you will do anything to get what you really want. But you are too late. You've already done so much. And with this little thing you wanted... or had wanted only temporarily - you don't even have that now.\n\nThe devil never tells you that. How could he? You are too blinded by your own wishful thinking as well as by the egoic impulses of your own nature. If he would have told you this, you'd have turned into a monster and destroyed yourself right away. For this reason Satan, unlike God, knows how many of his potential victims turn away when he tells them the truth. That's why he doesn't care a fig about the ones who do.\n\n`` You're not sure now.

{"id":4444,"ended":true,"length":400,"text":"A university lecture, packed with students in Evolutionary Sciences, gets hijacked by militant religious opponents, who hold the class hostage. Will you fight?\n\nThe Evolutionary Sciences lecture hall is full, with a few minutes to spare, before the instructor Professor John Sarnow is supposed to begin delivering his lecture. The classroom is quiet, as it always is, when people are sitting for an important class; the only difference is that today the tension has turned to anger, and the room is full of very upset students.\n\nThe instructor has received an alarming and hateful email from one of his students, who expresses her belief in creationism, and declares that if the professor wants to use the term 'Darwinist' because his course is titled as such, then he should have an 'Introduction to Religion' lecture as well. She expresses her anger with 'Science' and urges Professor Sarnow to explain his position further in order for the rest of the class to understand. At this point Professor Sarnow realizes that more than one student has written him an email, that he did not expect to receive, and, as such, is now concerned, wondering whether this matter indeed is trivial and he should dismiss it, as it appears to be; however, this is exactly the wrong thing to do in today's political climate...\n\nAn armed student enters the classroom and confronts the professor, who says \"no, no one is going to hurt me\", while holding his course textbook in his hands... He says something about his rights to speech, and then turns the gun on the professor and begins shooting... When the smoke clears a few minutes later, the campus police enter the room, and start talking to the professor and the students...\n\nHow will this turn out?\n\nThe first scene is based on a true story...\n\nThis flash game is a work of fiction, and any resemblance to any actual events, persons, or places, living of dead, or places is purely coincidental.\n\nThis game uses Unity 3D and the Unity 5.4 Editor.

{"id":4161,"ended":true,"length":411,"text":"You sit on your throne surrounded by your royal guard. A group of rebels burst into the room and after their leader's monologue, you realize you are the bad guy in a hero's story.\n\nThe bad guys are bad, but they have a point, they just don 't know what they are talking about. However, you have an army on your side ( the player ) that you rule by fear, you keep the poor, ignorant and the masses in check. The bad guys see themselves as heroes, who put everything, and everyone in its proper place.\n\nYou and your loyal troops march and march along, you have just one job, kill all those who oppose you! Your soldiers keep up a constant barrage of fire, that causes destruction and mayhem wherever it hits.\n\nYou get to witness your favorite actors, singers, you name it, kill, kill, kill!\n\nWhat you won 't see is that they are also doing the same in order for you to enjoy and believe their stories. At the end of the day, what you watch on tv, or what you read in newspapers, or what you are told by your government, or by your teachers, have all been carefully crafted to give you exactly what you want to hear.\n\nSo what is the answer? Do we need the bad guys, or will we learn to live better without them?\n\nA lot of games are making you think, this one forces you to act. It's up to you to solve your own problems, and not use the game for your entertainment.

You realize it's a window to the past : it shows the view from 50 years ago.\n\nThe house is a mirror, it shows what our society looks like 50 years ago. If we don 't change things, we will look back on this time much the same.\n\nIn \"A New Earth\", Eckhart Tolle describes the need to heal ourselves not just on the emotional and physical levels but also on the mental, psychic, and spiritual levels. At the time, this was radical and controversial. Some people didn 't believe mental illness was real. Those who believed mental illness had an outlet had difficulty understanding that the mind was as vulnerable as any other.\n\nThe most famous story about those who lived in the mental institutions in his time was that they wore \" rubber boots \" to walk on the cobbles.\n\nHe also describes how we need to let go of the past.\n\nThose who choose to use our past may have been more comfortable in their minds than we are in our own. They may have been able to let go or accept things that seem impossible to us and to others.\n\nWe all have the choice :\n\nDo we want to be stuck in the past, allowing our present to be as it is or can we be free?\n\nIf we keep living in our heads, the past will hold us hostage. It's time to let go of your past and set free\n\nWhat do I do with the past?\n\nThe most famous poem by Ernest Hemmingway, the \" For sale\" sign, was found by the man clearing out his grandmother's attic. It was discovered and published by the British newspaper the Daily Mirror.\n\nIt sums up the feelings of many writers : \" My past is a foreign country I cannot enter as I would like.\"\n\nIn other articles, I will talk about how writers of all types can use the past to create stories. Not all stories are pleasant ones.","token_len":433,"entropy":[10.3754,3.0953,2.5648,9.5914,0.2528,3.8603,0.7632,1.5358,12.0312,2.8747,0.5535,0.1911,2.6825,0.4455,1.8246,8.8632,0.0035,2.6146,4.3559,2.3524,4.3956,0.07,5.7366,6.3739,0.1592,2.4712,2.3884,7.1466,3.1915,3.0514,6.6373,2.8477,4.2526,2.5942,0.5986,2.3246,7.7277,3.4419,1.4124,2.4045,11.5165,3.4396,6.0811,1.8618,6.4856,1.8401,9.416,1.0702,0.2946,1.2894,1.7795,0.2462,2.6445,2.116,1.1427,3.0821,8.2317,2.6149,4.9246,3.1573,3.4665,5.4552,4.6928,2.6468,0.0257,5.4268,0.1119,0.1489,0.8831,4.7049,2.545,3.0372,11.7377,1.3336,3.4209,3.8442,0.9497,0.9483,2.6542,3.1432,1.5861,1.6928,3.2888,3.0612,6.3272,3.739,0.077,1.0234,1.1019,0.0003,4.1367,5.8711,3.6718,3.4439,5.4778,1.3561,11.0505,0.1567,0.4839,0.0009,3.2323,1.0788,5.4545,0.8003,7.461,3.3139,6.38,1.8973,5.2995,1.2488,5.5279,3.3843,0.5105,2.7669,1.2408,0.4853,0.8954,0.6707,2.3546,2.1449,5.0957,0.8767,0.7602,0.6039,0.5759,0.5948,5.9308,0.6961,3.6851,0.9917,3.3651,1.0833,9.0731,2.2824,5.8721,1.0294,4.7636,1.9175,4.6591,4.1247,1.2363,2.3715,8.9554,1.0737,0.9414,1.3738,1.9039,5.5153,0.4901,2.3055,2.8344,0.062,4.2097,3.8657,7.7054,4.7234,5.8459,2.7043,3.1363,2.5169,4.9193,1.0596,6.4103,6.1896,0.569,3.1571,0.207,2.1069,1.1184,0.0003,2.6694,4.8229,2.5253,5.2242,1.5281,6.7028,0.7534,4.6609,2.1795,1.0818,4.3714,5.4841,3.1911,6.4419,1.4247,1.6931,2.0168,3.79,8.1076,4.6627,15.5112,2.1299,0.4826,1.4619,5.2485,3.2434,0.9661,6.7416,1.2695,1.2293,1.993,0.0002,4.6925,2.5591,4.0528,1.3661,4.0136,3.2296,0.3288,6.1084,0.2942,0.1973,1.3517,3.6482,1.8517,1.7656,0.0001,6.3798,0.3038,6.6438,0.338,5.0243,3.7281,4.1106,4.6811,2.2294,3.3493,4.4466,4.5258,2.2376,1.8127,5.0401,1.6855,2.2023,1.1397,3.9737,0.7728,2.4236,0.5888,2.8329,1.0406,0.4273,1.7382,2.602,0.0102,5.7205,0.1423,5.7049,4.5228,4.0444,1.2751,6.161,2.9836,1.8993,4.081,3.3391,3.4607,1.2699,0.4513,1.1883,0.0002,2.4536,3.9257,1.2965,2.4414,4.9757,8.1254,3.887,0.0006,3.7926,0.6149,2.9436,0.1823,2.3642,5.9654,0.6262,1.3556,0.1717,1.8881,7.7484,1.7293,4.0406,0.7975,1.9066,5.7128,3.2246,0.6821,2.376,4.3877,0.1403,3.6346,2.8996,2.879,0.5817,0.0002,3.4575,0.33,5.8115,3.3285,0.8269,2.1474,4.6928,0.7281,3.4319,1.661,1.1184,5.6792,0.3453,5.0239,1.0814,3.2382,2.6287,2.3553,0.4857,2.723,0.1314,0.9136,5.3155,0.6976,1.0163,5.7194,4.4368,7.3982,0.0003,3.7526,1.784,3.9964,1.004,3.4001,2.1966,0.9671,1.0536,0.5877,0.0002,3.0652,3.7026,4.2118,5.9091,2.4107,6.2611,0.088,10.7358,0.0002,2.414,4.4286,2.9964,8.5804,7.7507,5.0514,7.1496,1.5046,1.8217,4.462,2.9042,2.6277,4.6547,11.8806,1.8754,1.3432,5.7731,0.0702,0.1788,1.0957,2.3662,1.726,6.2134,4.5309,3.3221,1.3661,1.5559,4.2166,1.989,3.0093,2.4175,1.9145,0.9076,0.768,0.0002,2.4823,6.7959,0.043,0.9808,4.3682,0.5326,2.3729,6.1887,4.4534,2.1766,6.0523,3.3,1.2227,2.8357,7.5635,4.3769,4.5222,2.703,4.8481,5.7865,1.4266,3.2213,0.674,2.6224,0.419,0.0002,3.3123,4.0421,6.9759,1.3132,2.3339,2.8109,3.1747,0.1778,1.7848,6.3839,3.8492,2.5236,3.2734,1.9433,3.5737,1.6588,0.2842,0.763,3.1904,5.066,2.0571,6.907,2.0023,3.3436,0.8933,7.6966,4.7882,0.9189]}

''\n\nThe mayor of Washington yesterday ordered a four-day closure of the city's subway, the world's third-largest, while a crack that appeared on Thursday in a third subway train is assessed. \"We need four days to see if there is enough deterioration in the third train not to be able to operate the subways,\" Adrian Fenty said in a brief interview.\n\nThe announcement came after a crack and pothole was discovered on one of four subway trains in two days.\n\nOn Wednesday, commuters had to deal with the closure of the entire subway system because one of its four lines was out of commission. The mayor estimated the damage at at least $1 million \u2014 far more than earlier reports suggested. \"We'll get that number as more information becomes available,\" he said.\n\nIt is not known when service will be returned to pre-crack conditions. \"The fourth train has been checked and they don't see a crack. As for the other three, well, they want to be sure that there is no damage before they can open them back up.\"\n\nMetro officials said that the repairs were taking far longer than originally expected because of the lack of subway service, which has forced repairs to be done on Saturday, the only working day. \"It might have been more expedient to go slower so that it could last longer, but for many of the employees, this is their working day,\" said Frank Stranz, the executive director of Metro Transit.\n\nMr. Stranz said that the transit authority expected the repairs to be completed by Thursday evening.\n\nHe said that the transit authority was also investigating whether two crack-causing materials, aluminum and polycarbonate, were the same as those involved in the other eight crack lines that were discovered less than two weeks ago.

{"id":659,"ended":true,"length":412,"text":"An unbeatable supervillain conquers the world, rules with an iron fist, grows bored, and eventually retires from public life. Years later, you strongly suspect the old man who just moved in next door is that retired supervillain.\n\nThe plot is a bit like \"The Man in the High Castle\". An evil country has won the Second World War while a democratic country was cut in two by the victorious forces and their former \"allies\". The democratic country has grown to rival the evil country in all aspects of the post-war lives of its citizens. A new supervillain, with a very specific agenda, has appeared on the scene.\n\nIt makes you wonder why you should play this game. I suspect it's the way you get to destroy evil houses that have had the temerity and the bad luck to have grown to match your own.\n\nYour strategy in this game is to build a \"base\" of evil houses while you are out conquering the world, and then use that evil house as the staging ground for your evil conquests. So you use that evil house as a \"base\" against everyone else's \"base\".\n\nSo the game has a lot of depth, and some of it is interesting. I suspect that some of it is artificial depth, meant to hide a lack of interesting decisions. For instance, evil is a resource, which you use in battles to get more combat cards, which are needed to win battles. The game gives almost no strategic direction about what those combat cards should look like. You just draw them and use them. But combat cards also have a \"base\" cost, so those costed cards act as your base against the enemy's attacks.\n\nThat's deep enough.\n\nBut what the game leaves unsaid is \"so, why should you bother with this base game if you also want to play this conquest game\". Well, to put it simply, evil is a resource in the conquest game, and the conquest game is fun.\n\nSo I give this game three out of five stars. It's a good base game, just not a good conquest game.","token_len":438,"entropy":[12.9991,0.0162,13.2333,0.0263,0.011,14.2214,0.0055,1.4659,1.5905,2.0152,8.8992,4.256,3.7154,0.8132,0.2298,0.6868,7.62,6.3506,1.7117,0.8389,4.3642,6.9772,0.0163,1.7581,5.0766,0.0992,0.4555,8.249,0.3115,0.2478,6.4437,12.6366,1.5835,2.9847,6.1301,1.5978,3.2759,5.6427,5.7417,2.1906,5.627,0.0776,1.9429,5.9127,8.4353,5.151,0.0049,0.003,1.3965,2.3067,0.0021,2.7304,5.7098,2.1566,2.7587,1.7946,4.4907,3.8958,1.9809,3.9926,2.1852,0.4701,0.2463,0.0113,2.0787,5.5202,3.1481,8.6091,2.9767,5.9026,1.1618,6.7003,0.3597,0.0066,6.509,2.0099,6.7301,1.7832,4.5091,7.4714,3.8738,2.4857,2.514,1.8123,5.8389,4.4168,4.8101,4.1221,5.2747,6.3481,7.598,0.4165,0.6357,1.3171,6.3501,1.2838,2.3235,5.4965,2.7696,5.5224,0.437,4.1785,0.7951,2.2349,4.5103,3.4786,1.3831,2.8839,8.0318,0.3314,0.2018,7.1633,0.3213,1.1358,0.558,0.6207,3.8999,3.0427,5.7485,0.0121,0.0074,2.2714,4.5473,1.5447,4.5816,3.7767,1.5819,0.5006,2.4647,4.5836,3.2996,0.4364,0.4119,1.3613,1.5732,0.0003,3.6231,5.4968,2.12,0.5494,2.1657,2.6529,2.7502,4.3675,1.2847,0.6298,0.9668,3.4173,5.7013,1.8676,0.9258,3.6945,3.7946,2.2183,3.2332,1.5019,9.4926,4.666,9.5351,3.6134,2.9359,5.3577,3.2595,5.5518,0.0123,4.8384,3.049,7.4626,1.0414,0.1827,3.9091,4.6352,2.7799,5.9271,1.4483,1.5808,1.0091,1.4792,0.0003,5.217,6.3177,3.2334,1.0015,0.155,0.5109,1.3762,3.6317,1.4565,4.5902,5.9331,0.597,1.0514,3.7964,2.1423,5.6608,2.3176,3.548,4.7639,6.9466,1.2785,0.1803,2.4439,2.1061,1.635,3.4079,1.6312,9.049,0.3112,1.3507,2.3888,6.169,0.9865,0.4431,0.6374,4.4964,7.4465,0.0028,0.2143,5.5926,1.8877,5.0068,3.7052,2.139,0.0634,0.8482,0.8861,3.7463,0.7973,0.3329,4.9095,5.2626,1.3661,4.1794,3.9394,1.3901,1.0246,1.3404,0.0002,4.0776,3.212,2.1984,3.3552,1.6957,1.9755,0.1937,5.0579,1.623,1.1481,3.8831,1.7558,1.2282,0.8166,4.1997,0.7244,2.3878,5.3406,1.7161,3.0257,0.292,1.093,0.6812,9.0101,8.6353,1.004,9.0106,0.2036,5.2661,2.696,4.1518,0.0158,5.5561,5.3092,1.2689,3.7392,1.2297,0.1167,8.1166,4.6487,2.1226,7.9841,1.9885,3.2123,1.6522,3.3855,3.1878,4.6346,1.6545,3.1757,3.1587,7.4407,4.5629,1.325,2.2608,2.867,4.0234,0.5278,2.3429,1.6479,0.6702,2.9983,1.919,4.6888,8.6708,0.7211,4.4144,5.4994,5.3774,1.8688,6.153,2.9568,0.1332,1.7134,2.2419,0.0092,1.0744,2.9077,3.9314,4.9143,1.7438,1.7303,3.0238,0.3155,2.3448,3.7138,7.33,0.6753,4.8282,1.7984,1.6832,3.5615,1.702,0.6496,8.2629,0.9217,2.1701,5.4426,4.3017,8.3904,2.6265,6.5119,0.4417,3.0075,1.4225,4.3804,1.9141,2.226,2.2066,6.2514,0.4842,0.9116,0.0002,4.2502,1.3089,9.4591,3.3737,2.0959,1.4262,0.0002,2.4037,2.9745,4.6133,0.8348,4.6986,8.7975,0.0031,0.1591,6.4342,6.9344,4.0424,3.0478,2.7942,1.2492,4.6086,1.8906,1.5982,5.9343,3.139,2.6556,0.4889,6.5736,1.1279,0.242,1.9624,3.1564,8.5543,0.2474,4.2879,3.7624,0.1574,4.1396,3.7771,0.1457,1.3836,0.3691,5.1847,1.9154,1.0325,0.5732,4.3416,1.5656,5.4073,0.1804,0.9852,0.87,2.6379,4.2408,0.2137,1.4103,6.2704,1.362,1.6025,0.0002,2.631,2.5094,5.5011,1.8626,0.1931,4.121,3.5656,0.0301,0.7901,0.0853,0.8053,2.4675,0.6103,1.4577,2.2019,6.3011,0.2416,0.8771,5.2209,0.7095,2.3912,2.0393,1.8279,0.1052,0.2164]}

That's when the angel said, \"If you will stop asking if you had done everything right, that will be the answer you receive.\"\nMiller stopped asking. He then asked God for an angel to visit him at work and tell him a \"good joke\" to break up the day.\nAccording to Miller, his angel told him, \"I have an idea that would make you laugh, but I will tell you what it is later.\"\nWhen Miller asked his angel to repeat the joke, he said, \"I have a good idea that will have you laugh and I will tell you what it is later.\"\nAs it turns out, the angel told Miller that the joke is, \"I wish I could send you more than one angel per day. Then you would have plenty to do.\"\nMiller told WQAD News 8 that being a farmer has its moments of humor. He noted that last year, when he was spraying chemicals into the air, \"a bee was walking on the hose and stopped when he reached me and walked around me. He went right into my backpack and looked around and the hose was still on me. He flew off with my backpack on.\"\nIt may seem strange that a stranger on the internet has a better idea than a God-sent angel but Miller said he takes the compliment and is grateful for the answer.\n\"I'd like to see him (my angel) again. I'll be sure to stop and thank him when I do.\"\nThanks for visiting PennLive. Quality local journalism has never been more important. We need your support. Not a subscriber yet?

{"id":2344,"ended":true,"length":396,"text":"You are Boltz-Man, a hero who can control probability. The more improbable the event, the more taxing it is for your body to alter the outcome of a certain event. Today, you must push past your body's limits in order to save the day.\n\nThe sequel to the award-winning action platformer, THE GAME OF TORTURE.\n\nGame of Torture is a two player action adventure in which you, the player, possess the \"Boltz-Man\" power, allowing you to control the outcome of any event, by simply altering the probability of it happening, from the single thread of fate.\n\nYou and your partner are on the case of a missing woman, one of whom you suspect has fallen victim to a brutal killer who has recently begun executing his hostages. With only little clues and very little time, you must navigate though multiple levels to stop him, using the power of probability on your side to succeed.\n\nThe Boltz-Man power comes in 2 forms, allowing you to either change or negate the probability of certain events within the game, as both a defense and offense.\n\nYou start out the game as an unknown, untested agent with a mysterious power, and must complete 8 stages in order to uncover the truth behind the death of his partner and friend, and stop the killer.\n\nTHE GAME OF TORTURE is a 2-player action adventure in which you can either control the outcome of any event, by altering the probability of it happening, or you can leave those events unsaid, allowing other events to happen, and allow other possibilities to exist.\n\nIt offers several different ways to approach the game, each with their own set of consequences, allowing players a wide range of decision making.\n\nThe game is presented in a modern sci-fi art, and incorporates a unique visual language. All levels are also randomized, allowing for players to experience the game again without the feeling of being restricted to a particular set of areas each time.\n\nThe game's music is based upon the music of video game composer Nobuo Uematsu. It uses the same music as FINAL FANTASY.","token_len":441,"entropy":[3.8828,14.1333,3.0695,5.0393,4.3933,1.462,2.7937,5.1239,2.1996,3.424,5.1636,10.0776,1.5589,3.4514,3.8415,5.7092,1.5347,2.9557,0.2485,0.0199,0.7593,13.6384,0.6612,0.8959,1.8749,3.0052,4.9213,0.6029,8.6854,1.886,2.2702,1.0434,2.8318,4.8673,1.7411,0.387,8.4,0.8734,2.2965,4.309,7.0074,4.9827,2.294,3.6196,0.8373,2.1218,3.1155,0.1029,0.0315,4.7856,1.7717,1.0535,0.4839,1.0884,0.0026,2.7278,10.231,1.3696,1.7089,5.4303,0.2186,0.0054,4.293,5.7859,0.0567,1.5066,7.6353,4.1376,1.5591,6.0719,4.1065,0.274,4.0121,0.9416,0.0002,6.271,0.9968,4.2949,0.0141,1.0267,0.8908,5.5266,2.0911,3.3497,1.7545,3.6525,0.7174,0.7102,4.4203,1.9006,0.9076,0.7298,8.7276,1.0892,6.4315,4.1307,0.0517,0.0499,0.6659,0.081,0.8935,2.4585,2.4983,3.7468,0.1246,0.0729,1.4334,1.419,1.8786,0.0326,2.8621,1.5476,2.5698,4.6941,4.2104,6.7217,0.4522,1.605,0.279,3.6383,0.6793,3.2293,4.73,2.6979,6.7091,9.8466,0.961,6.3331,2.3824,1.1111,0.0002,3.2093,4.5242,0.4686,3.2017,2.4626,3.7474,1.4761,7.9263,1.9713,0.7973,5.3911,3.1121,1.6625,5.2257,0.5734,2.6763,3.2845,4.5642,2.2548,4.3449,2.4737,0.0029,0.986,5.0689,5.0002,2.8487,1.2532,5.3976,5.9988,5.4332,3.6005,7.5178,0.3013,4.0372,3.9162,6.0203,6.907,3.7865,5.3395,0.4315,1.9314,1.2051,0.4203,0.5179,4.3287,10.3764,5.8177,3.173,1.9607,4.9634,1.968,1.5536,4.4126,2.0901,1.6427,0.1774,4.6696,5.8497,0.78,2.6634,1.4223,6.2626,0.6954,0.3029,0.0002,2.0181,7.8453,0.0045,0.1527,0.0173,2.6992,4.7592,1.5458,6.0807,2.5437,1.9257,5.5326,0.1264,0.0539,4.3363,4.5323,3.6272,4.7858,0.8618,0.7508,0.2357,4.2946,0.0802,6.2316,1.0744,0.602,1.4429,2.9142,7.2009,4.1392,7.6721,0.4682,3.1613,0.5385,1.1113,0.0002,2.6683,6.1679,1.924,3.8196,0.3325,1.5931,2.2734,6.0092,1.7719,6.1368,3.3702,5.1618,3.0045,2.003,3.8043,4.5995,2.1354,2.5329,3.5609,4.8702,7.3038,3.74,2.1266,0.101,0.0107,5.3048,0.9806,1.1552,0.7642,1.0085,4.5793,0.1094,2.0943,3.3796,3.0324,6.3203,1.6605,2.8611,4.4143,0.7539,0.588,0.9699,0.6313,0.0002,6.1515,0.6636,0.033,0.3247,0.0018,0.0059,1.0313,0.9265,2.6851,1.9056,0.0894,0.587,0.3696,0.6209,0.0164,0.1074,4.9411,0.6994,2.1613,0.351,0.7314,0.0501,0.5482,0.0354,0.1926,0.5024,8.0413,0.0388,0.0298,0.0287,0.063,0.015,0.0612,4.8954,1.961,0.2715,6.3583,7.6741,2.4788,6.9875,0.0917,2.0269,2.2796,6.5893,4.5725,0.2024,1.9923,2.9142,2.4737,4.1743,4.053,4.1901,0.2542,4.5666,0.4775,0.2416,0.0002,4.2753,4.7856,4.4823,1.7946,2.6867,0.4329,4.253,0.8168,0.6181,0.7601,2.8354,1.1854,2.2961,0.0217,3.2744,0.0211,3.682,1.3821,4.4104,3.0765,4.5216,3.1022,1.2063,0.0306,6.1111,1.3343,2.7802,0.3945,0.0002,1.9074,1.2089,1.8889,5.4647,0.7216,1.2887,5.3056,7.3717,0.0113,0.0016,6.0846,5.7064,2.5359,5.0283,1.9078,3.8715,4.2535,4.8088,1.8589,5.2997,3.724,1.1092,5.6031,7.7889,0.6003,1.3655,1.7466,4.0035,0.0665,4.9216,1.2904,1.4819,7.1373,4.5106,2.7799,6.3993,0.1587,2.2021,5.3367,1.774,1.8999,2.53,3.1804,0.0766,5.2508,7.7476,0.2528,0.4459,0.2319,0.0002,1.4135,0.7461,2.6998,5.6027,0.8292,3.9483,2.8041,0.7102,2.8314,0.1767,6.222,1.5251,2.2539,6.4557,0.307,0.0254,0.0017,0.0024,1.1852,4.0566,4.1336,1.838,2.3546,3.3072,1.6073,7.098,0.0083,4.3495]}

If it weren't for the actions of a lone soldier, the robots would have taken over long ago. The soldier who has taken down this new threat also bears the burden of bringing back the human race to their beloved Earth. On that note, we begin our campaign game.

The first batch of robots was found to have sent themselves to Earth, so they were destroyed, but after that, another batch was found, so another batch of anti-robots were sent to terminate this threat. But what else might we find to do?...","token_len":442,"entropy":[6.7362,1.8077,1.4674,8.711,3.8782,8.4058,7.4875,2.9097,3.2185,4.4394,3.0905,3.6123,2.4947,0.0893,1.4638,7.6143,4.5345,0.7943,1.2165,3.2904,7.833,6.0301,0.0007,5.8248,0.0021,1.9414,5.5436,3.7463,0.3045,4.2939,5.3868,1.0721,10.2747,1.587,4.1188,2.9564,0.5358,0.1114,0.4379,3.4057,3.2775,8.5402,1.3619,4.6086,4.508,0.0749,6.5044,2.2027,7.2933,5.3676,3.6173,5.6041,4.2715,1.9488,0.408,0.7475,6.576,1.8684,3.7632,1.7958,2.7605,2.669,0.4431,6.5292,7.3465,0.1468,0.4277,5.5247,3.3536,0.9574,2.6619,2.1899,1.3647,5.3303,2.1654,3.6527,4.0963,5.6117,5.6924,0.4667,4.8249,1.4464,6.1569,7.1616,4.7484,5.6721,1.9145,0.0295,3.9173,3.6279,5.231,2.1813,1.7809,10.5305,2.4008,5.5182,0.4065,4.9308,0.2319,0.8003,1.488,0.3758,2.764,3.5105,0.362,1.2819,6.0164,3.8358,1.8988,0.2123,0.6324,3.0828,4.2479,3.2334,0.2879,2.3559,3.5107,1.3094,6.1945,4.0065,7.1754,3.3945,0.0028,2.8294,0.2222,3.2359,0.7765,3.8371,8.0748,0.9565,4.6145,1.2963,0.4389,1.8516,4.9368,4.782,0.0004,5.9003,4.0447,1.6483,0.117,4.415,1.6074,0.5712,2.9889,4.2099,3.7625,0.2367,3.3315,3.1693,0.9467,0.3561,2.3404,2.0293,1.164,0.9447,3.9672,2.6563,1.8366,2.7293,6.5771,0.0353,1.4964,3.7956,1.2213,4.8689,0.001,3.0088,2.5714,2.0954,0.0155,7.8206,0.8414,5.2492,4.2664,2.4171,5.238,1.1625,2.8565,3.1476,1.1174,4.9402,0.513,5.0511,8.0297,3.5565,5.6653,1.9298,0.0664,4.0781,2.0136,7.8931,5.4407,0.5386,0.0002,4.1079,4.1114,2.0479,2.0188,2.4699,4.9526,6.4967,0.4786,4.1909,9.6942,1.8923,1.211,6.0791,3.1614,3.0552,0.9968,3.9257,3.1638,0.8822,0.3336,3.5682,1.0213,5.8613,6.3083,1.2296,1.5581,4.8924,1.0568,5.0458,1.9076,2.3795,0.4885,2.2153,0.9512,5.3476,0.7585,5.8618,1.2892,6.5978,0.5788,4.6408,2.3761,3.5694,0.1413,1.1936,0.8752,2.8353,3.1868,4.3456,0.9457,0.3364,0.918,0.0716,0.1118,0.8599,2.5307,0.0002,2.7034,5.6526,3.4028,0.8392,1.7452,3.7699,2.1589,1.0749,1.8912,6.4331,1.1627,2.9376,2.1306,6.2041,1.293,5.7857,1.8233,3.9308,0.0613,2.966,1.6234,2.7704,1.3691,1.0179,3.5423,0.6576,0.0869,1.4492,2.0266,9.782,0.6876,1.7415,7.4282,0.869,0.0696,3.3217,6.6366,4.6534,7.4541,0.0828,2.9938,4.8146,7.4394,5.4156,7.922,5.0237,5.0557,1.9432,0.0011,0.0383,1.3788,5.9245,0.0835,2.8342,5.5101,5.7322,1.0891,1.4914,5.1706,0.6602,0.7572,3.0064,0.2207,8.6723,0.1985,0.5729,2.4576,7.7113,4.0214,3.5615,3.5949,4.4181,3.5822,1.9433,3.0379,6.8673,6.5801,0.8226,4.0699,0.0241,5.3546,2.4657,0.7491,2.1866,0.3788,3.4091,2.5886,6.9067,2.0215,0.394,6.296,3.5837,3.3193,0.0597,3.8858,6.5232,1.7906,4.2777,7.7123,2.0178,3.7092,3.3322,4.6233,4.5814,9.5562,1.5893,1.5371,4.6741,2.026,2.6984,3.7118,5.4715,0.6183,3.5827,0.0225,2.084,4.2673,5.0829,5.4294,2.2709,3.4395,2.7181,0.1778,0.1808,2.5929,1.6221,1.6871,5.8961,1.58,3.9064,5.3329,0.0294,1.1361,0.6546,3.435,1.2213,2.5428,2.8113,1.5461,0.975,0.3126,3.4322,4.3272,2.6871,1.4565,5.2534,6.0411,1.2123,1.1492,1.9514,3.7135,2.7801,2.7349,4.9946,2.7821,1.0934,4.6185,2.5185,1.0141,6.037,0.2656,2.0627,1.9653,2.2067,3.426,6.3509,0.1908,0.9363,10.7817,0.0233,2.0293,0.4197,2.0284,0.8842,0.956,9.9839,2.7104,2.7595,0.2432,4.0541,3.0104,6.538,5.2668,2.4136,0.9545,3.7722,3.7794,1.4255,3.7285]}

There are so many, so here is an example of the current best-seller on Amazon:\n\nOne day the mother comes home from the store to find a note saying that everything in the house has been broken into. She discovers that all the windows are smashed and that her sons' bicycles and tools have been stolen. She quickly traces her kids' rides back to a local park, but the boys have had the bicycles for weeks and have been practicing hard on them. She finds a picture of the bicycles in his bedroom and asks her son about them. The boy tells her that he sold the bikes to a friend, but that when he returned the money the friend had given him was missing. When the mother asks if she can see the boy's friends, he denies it, but then says that he has a bike for them. He tells his mother that he found and repaired it in his garage and he offers the boys a ride without explaining what it is. The mom agrees. They stop by the house and as they leave the sons run back in their driveway. The mom tells the boys to stay out there because she wants to call the police. In the house she discovers they've broken into it too. All the valuables of the home are stolen. They've written their names on the mirror and taken the family pictures. When the police arrive the boys explain that they simply broke into the home to see the reaction of their mother.\n\nThis book is full of action, adventure and excitement and would be a great start to any children's book collection.\n\nPlease help us build our library. This book helped us, but there is still a lot of work left to see this library grow.\n\nWhen a parent uses e-reader technology to deliver books to their children, whether its Kindles, e-readers or tablets.

What do you think about dementia?\n\nCancer is a disease, while dementia is a disease of the mind. The difference is in the cells and the way the cells react to the stress.\n\nDementia begins with loss of ability. Cancer begins with a loss of normal function.\n\nDementia begins very slowly. Cancer begins very quickly because the body isn\u2019t able to fight against the cancerous cells.\n\nDementia causes a person to turn from himself. Cancer often causes a person to turn from others.\n\nCancer often causes people to be afraid to live. Dementia often causes people to be afraid to die.\n\nBoth dementia and cancer can also cause physical deformities. People with dementia can\u2019t control their facial expressions. People with cancer may have pain all over the body.\n\nDementia can sometimes start with something that is caused by a toxin. For example, if you don\u2019t stop smoking, you\u2019re more likely to develop dementia than someone who doesn\u2019t smoke.\n\nCancer cells can change into more cancer cells. When people with dementia change their face or change their voice, this can confuse other people.\n\nDementia can cause problems with your hands and feet. Cancer can cause problems with many of the other organs in the body.\n\nYou can also compare both diseases in their stages : a cancer beginning by the skin, lung or blood. A dementia beginning by the brain, the thinking, the speech.\n\nThe common symptom of dementia is that it slowly stops thinking of anything. The common symptom of cancer is that it stops all the body. In each case, the body cannot fight against the cancer.\n\nWhat do you think about the relation between cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease?\n\nFor more information about any topic please visit our Help Guide\n\nCancer : A disease of the body\n\nAlzheimer's disease : A disease of the mind","token_len":445,"entropy":[9.7385,1.2168,3.2106,1.5757,2.9353,1.6086,0.8236,3.3857,1.7027,8.7122,1.0859,0.9661,0.4758,0.0609,0.2209,1.3889,0.3613,12.1644,1.4209,2.8537,2.2253,1.0222,0.3122,3.0197,0.6976,8.3194,15.5273,9.2536,6.1662,0.731,0.3016,7.4819,0.0103,1.2542,0.6582,5.2747,2.713,0.5823,1.5818,1.3329,2.5126,0.3775,1.5874,0.0026,4.3251,1.7308,0.6545,0.5148,0.206,6.7653,7.6476,1.6952,0.2196,0.4382,0.3999,0.2901,0.1922,1.2506,0.1392,3.0388,4.8452,0.8416,4.4043,0.9317,7.3004,2.9741,1.5553,3.9811,2.076,1.0498,5.0223,0.7279,1.3143,4.4023,1.0073,2.7901,0.0002,3.7479,0.017,0.0069,6.7769,1.2469,5.0525,0.089,5.1714,3.299,6.0282,2.1565,0.2628,2.8598,0.913,0.0208,6.0313,1.8023,0.2099,1.6943,0.0002,2.3017,0.0263,0.0057,2.6737,7.7857,1.2274,0.6384,2.6865,1.5003,2.6625,2.7482,4.4216,1.509,2.6718,5.0333,12.8009,2.5606,0.4291,2.1548,0.0159,3.7872,3.25,1.731,1.8157,4.1666,0.9214,0.5021,0.7494,0.0002,1.1566,0.0036,0.0039,5.1379,2.194,4.5632,0.2362,6.348,4.1904,8.1246,2.4806,2.643,6.2027,1.3852,1.2985,0.1049,0.0777,0.4098,0.3325,2.6875,0.3419,1.1076,0.0002,3.2982,0.0653,3.2633,0.5311,3.5555,0.0458,3.4415,3.3883,3.0483,4.7517,0.7523,5.1025,0.0013,0.0058,2.6224,0.1185,0.4671,0.0186,0.7021,0.6643,0.3347,2.6417,0.0412,0.4623,0.0002,7.1183,2.844,0.0371,1.4355,2.265,5.1328,1.4068,3.6216,5.1245,0.1128,0.616,4.7862,0.8207,0.8641,1.931,9.708,0.1618,0.1599,5.9672,0.3824,5.6045,2.0634,0.7024,1.0132,0.0431,0.0947,4.7354,1.4056,5.2678,7.0278,0.2498,3.2227,0.1226,0.3991,1.0153,0.0002,1.4197,0.0162,0.009,1.2685,4.9132,5.8743,1.9222,4.8022,1.4676,1.3821,6.2477,0.0811,1.6596,6.2243,0.9405,2.9081,0.0958,0.0468,3.1146,1.0748,4.8607,0.4012,0.2904,0.0054,5.822,2.0924,0.6758,0.9642,4.753,0.0329,4.4091,2.5349,0.1065,0.0236,1.1493,1.1922,2.6859,2.3294,0.3341,1.6782,0.1888,0.0116,0.0069,1.3918,0.1355,0.5318,0.0002,2.3181,0.1263,8.5783,1.7466,4.3682,3.9624,4.4005,3.5471,1.5113,0.6378,3.6385,3.759,0.9412,0.9465,3.3525,1.9643,4.9761,2.4055,6.3506,0.1704,3.7005,0.2227,5.1489,1.6252,8.7591,3.7157,0.5448,0.7616,0.7716,0.0002,1.3637,0.0029,0.0079,0.6535,1.7499,3.689,0.9435,2.8067,6.5639,1.6373,0.7953,0.1829,6.2046,1.1537,0.3773,0.7052,0.0441,8.0231,2.4741,0.9236,3.8584,4.6922,1.4767,1.7529,0.0126,0.249,0.8302,0.0002,4.4539,1.2696,2.3976,7.9138,6.1639,2.4461,2.3298,5.0273,4.6991,9.0499,4.3519,4.0717,7.3959,5.2499,2.9237,5.5552,1.3451,7.9552,1.8916,3.4781,2.909,1.3393,4.0273,1.8032,0.1876,0.1578,1.1661,1.7313,3.2642,8.9883,1.8299,1.3752,4.0548,2.1688,1.037,0.0003,2.8357,6.6384,5.2361,0.3432,0.863,0.3228,3.8158,1.4548,6.4446,4.1743,6.5044,4.7837,3.8438,0.9464,2.4565,3.8293,0.07,0.0739,3.2026,0.6306,0.3696,0.256,1.6149,7.3583,2.4628,4.9297,6.6476,4.2162,6.587,1.4037,0.2946,0.9513,1.5412,4.9983,1.9597,1.3198,0.4327,0.4732,0.5618,0.4777,0.0002,3.5007,2.5961,0.1455,0.1581,0.1429,1.1129,7.0835,0.3095,1.8161,0.1012,2.8328,2.0644,0.016,0.2353,3.1852,0.2543,0.6779,0.0003,4.9059,1.9521,0.2224,1.0064,6.4191,5.5345,5.3084,1.1215,1.4173,5.2,6.2081,2.2806,0.0003,4.0252,0.0581,6.6115,2.5274,2.3635,0.4253,0.0427,3.0325,1.4575,0.0003,4.8648,0.0213,0.0076,0.2072,0.671,3.6954,0.5569,0.1513,0.103,0.0235,0.2983]}

It's 2am, and as he rings the doorbell, the owner is sleeping through the entire affair. The man is wearing no clothes and has a basket of peanuts with a sign reading 'Free Peanut Snacks'. The man continues to ring the bell.\n\nThe owner opens up the door and asks, \"Can I help you?\"\n\nThe man quickly responds, \"Yes, I was hoping to pick up a peanut snack but there are none in my basket.\"\n\nThe owner says, \"Sorry, but there are no peanuts at this house. What would you like?\"\n\nThe man replies, \"Well, I was also hoping to pick up a peanut snack.\"\n\nThe owner responds, \"I have a large stock of peanuts in the kitchen, and all I ask is that you ask politely before entering.\"\n\nThe man, puzzled and intrigued, enters the house. As he enters the kitchen, he yells to the owner,\n\n\"You know, I really enjoy peanuts.

NASA says it is \"the first interstellar object we have ever seen.\"\nNASA said it had observed \"two possible flyby candidate spacecraft\" on Wednesday and a third on Thursday. The agency then confirmed it had detected radio emissions from at least one of the objects.\n\"Since we have a good trajectory to Pluto, they will definitely be getting there in the coming years,\" said Dr. Alice Charpentier, principal investigator for the mission, in a statement. \"We also expect that they will pass by the two other known KBOs, or dwarf planets, of Pluto, Charon, and Haumea, in the 2020s, as well.\"\nThe three objects were previously discovered in the past few years. \"We have good models of all the KBOs,\" Charpentier added.\n\"The objects were discovered using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based astronomical telescopes,\" NASA said. \"In this example, the signal of the radio waves lasted for only a few days, but the speed at which the signal was received and the relative distances to the KBOs makes it possible that the source of the transmission is a spacecraft.\nThat implies that this space probe is either already heading to the outer solar system or will arrive at Pluto within the next few years. If it is already headed to the outer solar system, it will be going quite fast and will need time to get to Pluto.\nScientists believe there is a good chance that the signal might come from any of the bodies in the Kuiper belt. They said the findings open \"a new chapter\" in exploring the most distant regions of the solar system, and it provides more data about the solar system's formation.","token_len":447,"entropy":[9.6181,2.5237,11.1512,1.7738,3.2762,5.2742,1.1712,5.1413,4.3879,9.4731,6.8287,7.9068,5.5066,3.5878,16.0121,8.3049,5.5119,1.6418,10.1651,2.7417,4.8976,3.3973,4.1118,1.6188,3.7151,0.6732,4.6899,5.6846,1.748,5.9846,4.3847,0.1147,0.3492,0.4039,4.5809,2.973,1.7632,2.5644,0.0249,0.5798,1.7246,2.0568,2.2259,2.8433,4.8396,4.0772,1.403,5.0068,0.1996,0.1403,4.1339,0.31,4.2918,7.3648,2.8023,3.8356,1.1482,5.2645,3.3436,6.1575,3.3533,0.0983,4.5325,6.0978,2.3877,6.4964,2.7313,0.6703,5.3471,4.439,0.3467,1.9137,2.5185,2.1623,0.7052,1.436,4.8343,0.5719,2.7463,3.3431,2.3392,1.5454,1.7493,2.2096,0.2336,4.3729,2.6368,0.629,5.4617,0.5048,4.214,2.0074,0.9621,1.5039,0.7078,1.7571,0.0186,4.0534,11.3541,0.0037,0.8888,3.6269,2.0383,1.2965,1.8047,2.5889,5.7265,0.1721,5.2478,5.3768,5.1732,0.6797,1.2158,0.8173,1.7446,0.6029,1.7511,3.324,1.518,3.812,6.3892,2.042,3.9813,5.4489,6.9566,2.0523,6.4148,1.89,1.6809,2.6249,4.8527,2.6269,4.6984,2.0405,1.5623,0.5323,0.4997,1.8185,2.9222,6.9051,4.5125,2.2803,0.8961,1.6566,7.1052,4.2824,0.5083,6.5594,0.0023,0.3871,0.9753,0.6361,4.7784,0.7326,0.4587,2.7525,5.6721,1.802,1.677,3.7053,3.3925,8.6342,2.5919,1.8523,0.5036,5.7694,1.658,5.289,0.9436,6.4298,4.8896,2.3309,1.0923,1.792,2.7996,0.3694,0.9731,5.0448,0.0708,8.5681,8.8796,5.2466,0.0088,0.1764,4.5878,0.0222,0.9721,0.5058,2.3338,1.921,1.3684,0.2915,0.5016,0.2692,1.2436,1.6364,4.2962,2.3587,2.0069,2.1677,0.1531,4.9323,1.8611,2.1335,6.0876,2.171,3.3795,6.6421,5.6364,1.869,1.8654,4.9483,4.2957,0.5149,0.852,5.3676,2.7498,1.6131,2.1794,0.0059,1.8364,0.0864,6.8993,0.7331,0.393,1.6878,2.875,0.7701,5.5421,0.0701,2.4593,2.8417,0.4207,2.4332,0.1986,1.7076,5.157,2.0933,3.111,5.1092,2.5449,1.6281,1.6476,4.8789,4.5515,0.6341,1.7241,4.2795,1.5921,1.9409,6.3502,6.8919,1.0388,4.4628,2.4029,2.4974,0.0099,0.2634,3.619,0.9576,0.0056,0.0011,3.1571,0.1897,1.0193,3.5413,2.3576,4.6608,3.9429,2.0507,4.2255,4.4397,0.1526,3.7011,0.1336,0.0023,1.7274,7.6088,0.4003,0.0227,5.0429,2.6058,1.6092,1.7927,0.467,1.0003,0.8399,3.8558,3.2213,5.8439,0.3076,2.1388,7.4264,2.9294,1.4688,4.1103,5.1456,8.1773,0.8843,2.9909,1.2496,0.3529,3.2448,1.2988,2.3087,2.19,7.3705,3.118,0.0009,1.4809,1.9703,1.3018,2.4921,2.868,2.5846,5.9668,3.8983,2.1504,1.0011,3.167,0.0049,0.1595,6.0433,0.6628,1.3861,2.9953,1.2814,5.2835,0.9722,0.2135,6.4832,1.6601,2.2892,4.7051,3.1566,2.6378,6.9951,6.1342,0.4204,3.5165,5.3385,1.0541,1.586,5.5908,5.3669,6.1895,1.5775,1.3834,5.2332,1.3854,0.0031,0.399,2.8238,3.4034,2.5204,2.1875,2.8048,0.7465,0.1852,0.8277,0.4182,0.4541,4.8767,2.0122,1.8572,4.6896,3.5016,0.8393,0.8879,1.3848,0.1252,0.0011,0.2581,1.0913,1.6677,1.3383,6.285,6.6798,1.5988,2.8066,1.8479,4.0025,5.9095,0.1821,2.6146,1.2686,0.6554,1.0845,1.2485,5.2203,2.4978,3.3707,1.2399,0.8577,4.6703,0.0449,0.3833,0.9899,4.6901,3.7149,2.2816,0.1395,6.0065,1.0349,0.2301,7.0229,1.6888,0.4163,1.7238,4.3138,0.0003,1.9751,1.3326,3.8196,3.3495,1.8283,5.8432,7.4648,6.4022,1.0467,1.0017,2.6875,1.214,0.381,5.6417,0.6741,6.2056,1.2879,4.173,0.1416,0.3284,0.7804,0.0006,2.0441,1.5767,3.0937,5.3778,3.968,4.4304,1.854,0.9322,5.1252,0.0246,0.9302,4.6828,1.3001]}

We do not run cemeteries or memorials. We are simply here to provide a service to those individuals whose loved ones lie buried in war graves, and to those individuals who maintain war memorials.","token_len":448,"entropy":[4.7321,9.7578,2.5266,2.6179,8.889,3.5445,0.1324,1.5266,4.7905,0.1906,7.8372,0.6039,0.006,0.4802,0.123,2.7676,8.5228,10.1132,7.3004,4.9886,0.1739,2.1822,1.4528,6.1363,2.6267,7.3798,3.0875,7.0982,1.3102,6.3812,0.2744,2.8962,4.8826,3.9703,0.0121,8.1604,3.1628,5.3461,6.0741,9.4435,2.8838,1.1943,2.5587,4.0222,9.7562,8.0914,6.7735,4.9946,8.817,5.5848,4.9035,0.1268,1.529,0.0009,6.3437,4.6708,0.9982,1.2007,3.4834,3.1238,4.9732,1.4353,1.6304,3.4497,3.9695,1.3712,6.8359,3.9605,2.7319,5.4401,0.9194,2.3404,0.0056,0.0004,0.0039,0.0001,7.7477,8.3793,0.0154,5.6623,2.3445,4.1037,3.3806,0.3564,4.3112,4.9561,2.1333,4.681,5.8043,1.5855,1.6027,7.6635,0.6856,1.5366,3.4567,0.0004,6.1956,6.3024,6.4031,4.0862,0.8594,2.9031,4.0112,0.004,0.0013,0.002,0.0008,2.5736,4.6123,4.8562,6.1639,3.6091,3.3501,4.4125,2.7044,0.4824,1.5114,0.0002,7.2692,0.2199,0.0069,0.0054,3.7155,3.9111,1.2728,4.3723,0.1136,4.6368,7.7803,3.6172,1.8563,7.1127,3.5423,2.9281,0.0635,2.5924,4.8996,4.1753,0.293,0.822,1.1278,0.4271,0.0068,0.0029,0.0229,0.0094,0.0114,0.0073,0.0005,0.0005,0.0007,0.0003,1.2736,0.6206,0.0001,2.8851,3.7922,4.914,0.6714,5.9039,2.8443,3.6176,5.0833,2.3339,3.1498,6.6148,3.2849,3.8887,3.1775,4.2679,1.6715,2.9707,3.5957,0.172,1.0836,2.464,0.171,2.1016,1.1355,5.0568,1.4538,0.0113,0.0108,0.805,2.5105,0.422,0.2426,0.0001,3.7171,0.0006,0.0028,3.7259,2.3803,4.3772,1.3784,4.8992,0.025,7.2699,1.2064,2.4963,3.5843,0.7523,4.4422,0.0005,2.7361,2.7353,0.4633,5.129,2.7453,0.7368,0.022,3.2025,0.1901,2.4409,2.332,1.0015,1.8914,0.612,0.2341,0.0001,4.3411,0.1161,5.9834,3.6875,2.2823,2.8671,6.0954,2.8656,2.3672,12.3781,2.253,5.7183,1.4428,4.6483,8.3047,4.2245,4.7543,8.9297,2.5954,5.3272,1.8878,4.1626,0.7994,7.2685,0.0093,2.2765,4.9031,0.4694,6.1957,0.3735,0.1482,0.0001,3.6244,5.0627,4.175,0.7893,2.0173,0.6887,0.7248,1.3553,1.6652,0.8237,0.3734,0.9266,0.8363,2.0143,0.1517,1.727,1.8555,1.3077,2.0699,7.2801,15.1613,6.8133,7.9548,7.5458,3.0191,10.1348,2.8609,6.1236,0.074,5.7008,1.1216,0.9198,0.4612,1.1153,6.2013,1.7711,3.6685,1.7637,3.4919,3.7251,0.903,8.1994,2.0274,3.6139,5.824,0.1723,0.4164,0.1122,3.8296,2.9179,1.6155,2.9859,0.1687,0.2695,0.1554,0.0001,5.6483,5.7368,7.9631,8.6584,5.023,1.3631,0.8453,1.6649,0.0001,5.258,0.8277,6.2258,7.2402,3.8816,4.8703,10.1583,2.5614,2.8271,1.3479,6.2673,2.6081,2.0855,1.7605,1.0329,0.9981,8.6978,0.0573,0.6618,8.4498,5.0658,0.0099,3.6242,3.2795,0.3803,1.2568,0.6277,5.4801,1.6452,3.0435,0.0094,1.9896,4.7526,0.999,0.0728,4.7531,3.7161,2.1741,0.2234,4.4953,1.871,3.5658,0.0356,2.4613,1.2805,3.3377,0.0309,0.0027,2.5303,4.2894,0.0865,0.166,0.0001,2.8828,6.7078,7.1961,0.7874,1.8005,1.4494,2.5661,0.0745,0.1613,2.3208,0.9802,0.0197,3.6844,6.8177,0.7604,2.5829,1.7677,0.0002,1.2738,3.3742,0.7821,5.3036,2.0082,4.2028,1.215,5.0695,2.4745,2.7465,2.7947,0.112,4.1175,1.175,1.4589,7.3593,0.9281,1.4155,1.7139,0.6399,5.0971,9.1942,0.014,0.0028,0.0001,1.1885,1.0884,0.198,1.356,0.9202,1.5174,2.803,4.7332,0.258,2.3945,1.8388,3.14,0.5309,1.2215,6.6964,3.7495,2.843,0.0219,8.1062,1.1759,1.0823,5.0678,1.0178,2.1244,2.6046,1.4139,1.2389,4.4014,0.4035,7.9507,4.759,0.8734,0.0243,1.4348]}
{"id":2288,"ended":true,"length":425,"text":"What You Think Is Happening Isn't Happening\n\nThe most interesting thing about the US economy\u2014and a major contributing factor to its weakness\u2014is that the business cycle is being delayed.\n\nThere are two related, if distinct, reasons for this. First, people keep delaying retirement. Because the average worker is staying in the workplace longer, businesses aren't having demand for employees, and businesses aren't having growth.\n\nThe problem is, if the supply of new workers is low and the demand for new workers is high, then there will be an upsurge in price inflation. Businesses will say, \"Well, we're going to work to keep those prices low, so we can keep people working longer, but we're not going to be able to do that much more. It's unsustainable, so we're going to have to do something that works in our favor\u2014raise wages.\" Once you have that initial bump in wage inflation, all you have to do is start with a little bit higher prices, or a lot of margin pressure, and your industry basically implodes.\n\nThe second part of it is that what we see today where everything is going up, is just a temporary bubble in prices. People spend money on their home, and their home prices go up, and they use that money to buy more stuff. We just saw that happen: Americans bought SUVs, and their houses went up in value. Now, everyone realizes that those houses are going to depreciate. When we get into a recession or a slump, the prices are going to go down, and the people who didn't buy houses in 2007 will be left holding the bag. When that first happens, it feels so good. We're just feeling good from all this inflation in housing prices, so we keep spending like crazy, but when that bubble pops, all of a sudden, the demand goes away.\n\nThis is why we are in a very dangerous position, and is likely to be a major contributing factor to the next recession. Because we are still trying to get Americans to put enough money aside so they can retire. We are delaying that process, and so it's actually more dangerous than we think.","token_len":449,"entropy":[7.0775,4.6152,3.51,3.6105,0.0217,8.5031,0.001,3.8095,0.0058,1.4306,0.0013,2.7627,4.0574,3.02,1.1797,0.5748,1.8905,6.665,2.8848,6.3169,1.0028,4.5686,3.6438,6.1886,0.0614,0.2004,2.1716,5.1821,0.2614,0.1306,0.6192,2.1584,6.0783,0.7743,1.0798,4.5676,7.0078,1.0881,2.3504,0.0002,3.7914,1.2609,2.2091,7.1395,4.3124,3.7799,4.5579,0.2699,2.0291,0.6587,0.5196,0.8193,2.1149,0.1133,4.8148,5.8929,4.7407,4.7395,1.1436,5.5824,1.9907,5.0579,2.1447,1.9781,7.1824,1.4289,1.0639,4.4964,0.6562,1.7739,5.7024,5.1428,0.0003,4.742,9.3758,0.4819,2.8821,2.3993,1.1733,4.2717,2.3137,0.0001,1.4794,6.7936,1.2019,2.0101,0.0002,2.9384,6.1399,0.7337,1.8756,3.8251,2.5229,6.1513,0.4267,3.6415,0.977,1.3358,3.0526,2.4331,1.5291,0.3394,0.4177,1.7168,0.9068,0.2547,0.2602,0.1225,2.2175,2.7501,1.5065,0.1163,3.344,6.6375,0.7995,0.0001,0.288,6.4582,3.7724,0.791,5.7169,0.14,0.7698,6.0003,0.7671,0.1503,1.6886,0.0951,1.4402,1.5267,1.396,0.0407,5.516,4.7227,2.7531,4.6468,1.9876,0.7429,1.4669,1.8981,0.5098,1.8658,1.7361,4.5431,2.9627,0.661,2.223,2.0179,0.7912,1.1106,1.2467,0.1757,0.0047,2.1473,0.1889,0.0019,3.3886,0.7857,4.7611,1.5186,3.5603,3.6538,0.5172,8.0289,2.5493,2.905,0.348,0.641,0.3764,0.0121,1.7053,0.083,2.3681,0.5237,5.1756,3.762,4.4575,2.2681,0.1093,4.7765,7.6369,1.1157,1.9216,7.6737,1.7826,2.3427,1.1121,6.6963,6.3317,0.6994,4.7727,0.867,0.3276,5.523,1.4842,0.9401,0.5153,0.0526,0.0968,3.7797,6.546,1.2637,4.442,0.8371,2.4988,1.8675,1.6769,4.609,2.7514,2.6879,2.2979,8.6489,5.7659,1.3614,0.4362,4.6193,6.0037,8.5911,6.564,0.0076,0.2569,0.3403,0.0002,2.133,0.1963,5.1611,0.2289,6.0737,0.2423,0.8301,6.1884,2.0567,2.3648,3.4703,8.0506,6.971,0.7242,2.066,2.2262,2.4154,2.5788,4.1926,1.7047,4.5599,4.9412,2.9082,2.7917,0.7836,3.4726,6.2071,2.9404,1.7226,4.2087,4.0265,1.0537,1.2011,3.3327,3.3416,2.3412,0.9921,0.2459,1.5011,0.4358,1.5101,5.7428,1.3522,0.3142,0.2398,0.7709,2.645,1.7101,0.7907,4.2899,4.2942,3.2048,1.7959,2.5693,6.7335,5.6704,2.8676,9.825,0.0005,1.1775,1.3772,2.8282,4.415,0.6164,0.0777,3.5822,0.458,0.7727,3.6989,0.8672,5.8107,6.0654,0.5416,4.8981,2.1634,0.7243,1.2265,0.1371,9.3826,0.0003,0.0002,1.8162,4.6773,3.2155,3.0497,2.2175,1.1538,1.6438,4.6494,0.9314,4.4487,0.2969,2.2293,4.0754,2.6595,0.0979,0.6826,0.6841,2.0216,1.1222,0.3199,1.8549,3.177,0.6364,6.4978,0.0003,1.5454,4.2271,3.8301,4.3274,2.2151,1.8536,4.133,3.8347,1.597,0.2865,0.8536,4.4542,2.8365,5.7029,5.0438,0.1009,2.2486,6.4569,4.897,1.709,1.0504,4.1147,1.2649,3.2299,5.9098,1.7102,6.3262,3.2192,2.684,5.1353,4.863,5.5645,1.2858,1.4397,3.4433,1.4674,5.9997,4.42,6.9681,1.2133,1.954,2.1996,3.4071,1.9957,2.7368,1.0025,0.3932,4.3879,1.4995,0.2522,0.0001,1.7177,2.075,3.9828,3.6301,5.698,0.626,0.7564,0.0001,3.4752,0.9557,2.0367,2.2724,3.6028,3.1817,0.8368,3.7242,3.7164,3.1218,2.4683,1.8711,6.0558,5.9419,0.5276,1.8626,3.0504,2.6543,4.4314,0.0483,0.5264,0.4947,3.6543,0.4921,0.4376,4.6592,2.7045,1.5991,4.7419,3.848,0.014,2.5333,5.5355,0.6376,4.3473,4.3931,0.5555,2.7342,4.1919,1.1749,0.2685,3.9573,1.6972,2.1326,1.5182,6.347,2.0632,1.8589,1.6654,0.8775,5.0551,2.9845,1.1931,4.504,4.2829,3.9453,1.203,2.0727,1.3782,0.254]}

{"id":3066,"ended":true,"length":427,"text":"`` If it eases her pain, then let her sing. ''\n\n--Katherine Hamnett\n\nIn our hearts, we've always known that the world of rock 'n' roll is a fickle one. Every scene, every movement is only as vibrant as the people who keep the flame burning bright enough to spark the imaginations of a new generation. But for too much of the past decade, the world of rock 'n' roll has remained mired in the old ways of doing things. That's why we decided to put our own twist on the legendary Clash by launching our own monthly rock 'n' roll video festival and launching a call to arms to the rock scene to step up its game. The idea was simple : to provide you, the reader, with a regular fix of the music that we'd fallen in love with, in the hopes that you'd come back in droves to support our efforts and, hopefully, continue to create a brighter future for the industry that brought you so much pleasure. As part of that mission, our editors have created a video every month in the hopes that it will help you enjoy music without ever hearing it on the radio or watching it on TV. And since many of us are more than willing to share their experiences, we thought we'd gather together a collection of some of the best ones that have emerged so far...\n\nThe videos come in all different shapes and sizes -- some are simple shots of bands doing their thing, while others have been turned into miniature works-of-art by the folks at the band's record labels -- but what they all share in common is that each one is made with the passion of someone who loves the music and wants you to love it too. The first batch of videos was a lot like reading the pages of a record -- something that helped pass the time when you had less to do with the time you had. But it's still unclear how this experiment will fare in the long run. One thing is certain, though -- even if the best of rock 'n' roll doesn't return, the spirit of rock 'n' roll will. Hopefully through the stories, insights and opinions of the people who actually lived through it.","token_len":451,"entropy":[7.2818,4.1991,10.2582,1.1891,5.6574,4.8838,0.6554,2.7164,4.4663,0.9329,6.0794,1.2732,7.9132,4.2134,0.085,4.791,7.6204,4.9819,9.0274,5.8673,0.1912,1.7798,0.0005,5.3078,5.5141,6.5301,0.856,1.6321,4.3981,2.4841,2.7493,1.1775,2.9467,4.0193,2.8284,6.2668,1.7085,0.0141,0.1559,0.0047,1.2575,2.0388,6.5498,0.2722,2.3808,0.557,5.3616,5.9467,2.5821,1.2239,5.9533,2.4008,6.6389,2.6034,7.115,0.1875,0.529,4.1979,1.3081,5.9385,2.854,5.1827,1.566,6.6336,5.7788,0.4396,4.3546,1.8969,6.3249,0.0051,0.2096,3.6572,3.6279,0.1292,0.4109,2.1679,4.0153,5.2766,4.0515,0.616,1.6227,1.2407,2.1924,0.3197,2.068,3.2171,0.7243,0.3202,0.3179,0.0018,0.0207,0.002,0.2299,4.6458,5.8918,0.2021,0.0305,2.0774,5.3966,3.1626,2.2408,6.4668,0.8711,1.2958,4.5914,0.7597,1.3983,1.4008,4.0567,0.2104,4.0216,2.6384,2.5796,4.3101,0.1611,1.1128,7.8144,11.1932,6.2123,5.2612,2.1886,1.1544,7.0024,3.0157,0.7747,0.0057,0.0298,0.0044,4.6355,6.5651,4.5326,4.3301,1.6346,7.7696,1.312,2.3551,1.5317,4.0728,3.9463,4.3523,2.624,6.8074,0.1571,4.1297,2.1418,0.4093,3.2768,3.6292,2.3732,1.0365,8.9556,2.9475,4.4701,4.8088,3.9558,0.5695,5.3776,0.1017,0.0966,1.0753,6.6684,8.8465,0.8457,2.124,4.2912,1.8798,2.9998,3.1638,7.5429,0.9392,0.002,0.0497,2.9295,3.8658,2.1385,2.0274,0.3862,1.2192,1.3568,3.6492,1.4221,3.893,3.8932,0.0003,0.8551,3.5803,1.844,2.3325,2.5405,5.4051,2.6795,0.0233,4.9742,0.4821,5.1686,1.7591,4.6306,0.887,0.4047,1.7091,4.3496,3.8916,5.6631,2.4697,2.3966,0.1904,4.8881,0.6437,4.2238,3.4803,0.0008,2.1496,3.3116,0.0789,3.7178,6.5555,2.5856,2.7153,0.781,2.9173,5.9122,2.185,3.6592,3.04,2.067,0.4038,3.822,0.969,2.278,1.4332,5.5232,3.8134,5.6233,4.05,7.3524,0.7605,2.722,0.9627,0.6838,1.4312,5.434,1.0037,0.8103,1.1978,0.3333,3.3428,4.6079,5.484,0.3263,2.3155,1.9733,5.8782,1.236,1.7818,0.1121,2.9368,5.2031,3.2962,1.2821,0.6348,3.1888,1.4068,0.267,7.1852,2.3346,1.0662,3.1628,0.1147,2.8287,0.073,0.6063,0.8542,5.9291,2.6705,2.3611,4.9604,2.5879,0.0029,5.809,1.0945,0.0003,3.036,6.3817,4.31,1.5467,3.7618,2.3033,2.5752,0.1956,0.1607,5.671,3.5958,1.8533,4.1238,6.1695,0.5948,4.3285,3.7967,1.7505,1.024,0.8765,2.0524,0.1493,3.1664,4.7422,6.5654,0.1206,7.9974,5.993,7.4734,1.6634,0.0058,0.7157,2.6764,2.1019,4.6443,0.7727,2.7148,4.1578,1.5889,5.6962,3.679,3.7973,1.7711,4.5038,2.3845,0.9962,1.5471,0.6489,0.0027,0.1741,1.0922,3.7021,1.5106,1.1794,4.4999,2.2461,1.3207,4.6398,0.9438,5.2639,0.7382,2.3723,1.9352,1.193,2.2201,2.1377,5.1748,0.03,3.8367,0.7042,3.1714,0.2206,2.8094,3.5785,5.5053,0.3895,2.0188,3.6826,3.3795,5.3023,3.0058,6.6209,2.3864,5.3733,0.0699,1.0231,6.4282,5.3698,5.6407,1.3448,5.4308,7.9087,1.2446,0.2693,3.158,3.5207,2.9157,5.8384,1.8228,1.0381,3.7934,1.0659,6.0009,1.6552,1.4043,3.1572,2.5667,3.1467,1.6831,4.0065,9.2387,1.2343,3.5755,7.7287,1.1433,4.1541,1.6723,0.4364,1.7025,0.2011,0.8424,4.5715,0.9495,1.0876,0.9049,1.5418,0.4517,2.5453,4.8485,0.9685,1.9283,5.2091,1.5294,3.4217,0.2209,0.0019,0.0129,0.0033,3.1512,0.0006,5.6341,1.6656,1.9265,5.7908,0.2175,1.4132,0.1175,0.0036,0.0073,0.003,0.9697,3.3832,6.4994,7.0717,1.7884,6.4395,2.4882,5.4632,1.0576,4.5312,1.103,2.0144,2.2368,0.5486,5.5483,6.9723,0.6048,1.3561,4.1723]}
{"id":457,"ended":true,"length":428,"text":"Humanity has begun exploring the galaxy, we find many worlds filled with ruins of civilizations that had long died out, realizing soon that all of these civilizations chose to end themselves, committing mass suicide. No one could figure out why they did it, until now.\n\nThe reason for the deaths is a virus, a plague that was released into the world, infecting the majority of its populace. Once the epidemic began, mass suicides, wars, and anarchy began, causing humanity to break into countless small warring groups.\n\nAs space exploration continued, the virus began to spread through out the galaxy, infecting everything and causing devastation. At the height of the epidemic, the great warring groups of humanity all but wiped each other out. Those who weren't dead had left the galaxy, fleeing from the plague. The last remaining human civilizations were a handful of isolated worlds, all facing oblivion.\n\nSoon, as the plague worsened, humanity was reduced to just a few million survivors, most starving to death or dying off from the plague or from the harsh environment and conditions. All remaining humans were forced to turn to cannibalism due to lack of resources.\n\nJust as life seemed doomed for the human race, the universe began to regenerate and began to revolve back and forth, in time. At first humanity waited with wonder as nothing ever moved, then one day everything started turning. The solar systems were restored as well as the planets and the moons, and the galaxy began to rotate at a reasonable pace once again.\n\nAs the years passed and the human population grew, they watched with awe as life returned to the universe. Eventually, humanity rose out of its death throes, realizing that the galaxy could not be destroyed, and began to rebuild its civilization from near zero.\n\nDuring the rebirth of the universe, the few remaining humans found out that this was not the only galaxy that was being created. As galaxies began to sprout left and right, they realized that they must join together to create something, like the original galaxies, but even less chaotic of course.\n\nIn time, it was decided that a name would be given to this new unified galaxy to make life easier. The name chosen was Galaxy.","token_len":452,"entropy":[7.4121,3.3745,5.8865,6.3833,1.6624,8.0412,2.159,6.1837,5.037,4.5392,3.7575,5.4337,0.0319,6.1411,3.0801,3.129,2.1905,3.2495,3.6649,5.8828,1.0642,1.6924,10.6991,8.4812,0.6956,4.5545,1.8107,2.4983,2.2904,10.2643,0.2728,5.3352,6.0206,2.346,8.6994,4.6856,1.4584,1.1098,5.8763,1.4102,4.3805,5.5827,0.0643,1.4277,2.3337,1.6688,1.493,0.6827,4.8574,2.8271,0.3969,1.6918,0.0116,2.3065,6.434,1.9406,1.1457,4.8708,2.0545,3.1286,6.9408,2.066,2.1574,3.5762,1.5525,3.7174,5.3835,2.2915,0.5127,3.2403,2.1269,2.7903,0.021,1.7446,5.2701,0.0651,2.7326,3.7296,0.6343,5.0412,1.4601,4.8105,3.3487,0.438,8.2657,3.7506,3.8076,5.2227,0.4149,0.6999,6.3447,1.7395,2.51,3.6729,4.8039,0.1468,5.8168,3.4687,4.8375,3.909,6.2587,0.5588,3.0154,1.3976,2.0643,0.0002,3.8567,7.2891,2.9526,3.8538,0.6043,1.5946,5.0531,2.1868,0.6721,0.5792,3.1001,7.8771,0.4804,0.1637,0.5945,2.7235,0.0091,4.5798,3.9893,3.5138,5.0571,1.4221,5.0935,1.3721,4.2324,0.0265,0.8224,2.476,0.0789,1.5349,6.5425,4.3419,2.0812,2.7659,1.4449,2.2997,5.9089,5.3416,1.9503,5.4668,0.0202,0.0381,1.0989,5.7164,1.0343,6.4781,0.0006,5.1323,3.8849,4.955,1.4266,0.3549,0.8229,5.3129,2.8697,0.7225,2.9065,1.3975,2.4354,3.8203,2.8544,3.7689,5.1922,1.815,6.2623,5.1991,0.4314,3.9427,2.2434,1.2975,3.5192,6.927,10.6941,0.0148,0.4636,0.6948,0.0002,5.8674,0.6744,4.1364,0.9502,2.5508,7.1086,0.2088,1.9488,2.3931,5.3552,0.0712,4.3881,1.1091,1.2734,4.836,2.5059,1.2924,4.8023,8.2784,1.4897,0.0639,4.52,1.6601,4.1956,3.7359,0.9878,1.4084,5.8446,2.0998,1.5464,6.272,2.3115,4.358,4.253,0.9329,4.5965,6.1912,2.1161,1.2913,2.4787,0.1515,5.0601,0.2546,3.58,0.1133,5.9787,0.0105,3.7501,0.0015,2.1348,1.5688,1.3521,0.0002,5.8563,0.8629,5.718,4.0959,5.4396,3.3237,1.2053,5.444,0.3629,0.2501,1.0772,5.4323,1.037,0.2048,5.3919,2.6446,2.9888,0.5632,6.5966,0.0488,5.9397,4.0366,0.0458,2.3606,4.7701,3.9002,2.4704,4.5887,2.7611,3.7549,6.8609,4.5152,6.3407,1.8976,6.9379,3.5437,5.8263,1.4217,4.1676,5.3681,0.6263,4.8604,2.8121,5.2741,2.4429,2.307,6.8103,4.8124,1.9739,4.5037,4.0841,2.7484,1.0328,0.7206,2.7533,2.0425,2.5226,2.6088,1.172,1.5994,1.4121,3.2704,1.3897,0.1226,6.0327,4.2647,0.8981,6.7054,1.2539,5.1516,1.1123,0.2648,0.7391,0.0002,3.1065,1.0393,4.4369,0.9204,2.1061,0.7969,3.6234,1.858,1.509,0.5984,2.8552,7.3721,2.8089,2.6687,0.2684,4.443,4.9217,0.4992,2.0717,3.0988,0.9941,3.6273,0.4654,1.7739,6.3207,4.8876,0.0176,3.1387,5.5752,1.0459,0.0,1.0768,5.0906,0.5801,1.8514,3.1363,3.8495,1.7687,1.6793,1.9305,1.6566,1.023,2.9728,0.6181,1.6484,2.4675,1.8024,3.6348,10.2153,2.8853,1.7262,0.5857,0.0002,5.5463,1.13,8.8502,0.5642,0.8774,2.2626,0.1879,1.4155,6.8213,1.1276,1.3485,4.1553,4.1846,0.8371,4.4187,1.0928,1.8771,0.9008,3.1628,4.2519,2.0111,1.2697,3.1565,3.848,1.1972,3.2705,6.9802,1.6734,0.1441,5.6744,0.0013,9.2504,0.961,0.0216,0.3185,2.3505,3.7072,0.3155,2.4941,3.8072,5.4337,1.872,1.0861,1.8477,2.9202,4.2374,6.0416,1.6221,5.6468,4.8563,1.7148,3.2087,5.4049,5.3871,7.7558,7.166,4.8099,0.329,0.8458,0.0002,3.1731,3.2633,0.0728,4.3538,1.5701,3.0094,0.2246,3.3071,7.1397,1.4073,0.2017,1.3818,0.334,2.1011,0.8998,8.6718,1.5555,4.8172,3.6437,4.7577,2.7814,2.457,1.6016,0.4587,7.2416,1.1147,6.2936,2.6148]}

''\n\n--Katherine Mansfield\n\nTuesday, October 13, 2009\n\nThe world as reflected off the surface, its meaning a mere mirage of fantasy-dream, the world is an infinite universe. But there are no gods, no devils, no miracles; the world we see is the world we are given, and everything that is said about the world is said by men.\n\n--Lamartine\n\nIt makes you think about what you said in college. I am still so grateful for the fact that I had the support of my family in my effort to pursue a career as a writer. I will never forget those times when I would be stuck with a creative writing assignment, and I would go to my mom and dad for advice. They always told me, \"No one is going to hire you in your field. It's really a very difficult time. That's all I want you to know.\" I wanted to go to Columbia because it was a prestigious school. I wanted to go to NYU because it was where my idol Nora Ephron grew up....and it still is where my idol Nora Ephron grew up. I wanted to go to Princeton because that's where Toni Morrison came from.\n\n\"And there's a third reason that I wanted to go to Princeton: they taught me how to write...The classes aren't only about the writing, but about the teacher: his approach to the teaching and his enthusiasm for his subject and the writing. He's been at this a long time and he teaches the way a scholar would teach. He's serious, he wants to have you read and reread and understand.\"\n\n--Toni Morrison\n\nI want to thank my family for supporting me all these years and for being my inspiration throughout. I thank all of my professors for the wonderful opportunities that you gave me. I thank my dear friend and former advisor, Professor Robert A. Schleicher for showing me the way. And above all, I thank my parents for believing in me during my entire life--because through it all, they knew I would make it in the end.","token_len":453,"entropy":[4.7587,7.8894,10.077,8.2314,5.5761,9.4015,6.5462,1.5807,4.458,2.3745,2.1643,1.9396,0.6935,4.9684,5.5171,0.7143,4.1734,1.8943,0.0468,3.5534,7.9603,4.6517,9.5692,0.3222,1.6859,0.0005,9.4405,0.175,2.73,3.5056,0.1731,3.4577,0.442,0.0002,3.2855,5.7887,6.1802,9.8608,7.1138,1.2314,4.1305,3.2605,6.0995,6.6319,6.3395,6.0223,5.7928,0.0015,2.643,7.6894,5.661,5.7244,3.5395,3.4475,2.5792,3.4352,4.2743,4.5778,4.5927,1.6155,3.4169,3.1205,1.3667,3.7373,3.9495,1.0926,0.5323,5.1921,0.2647,0.1757,5.8808,3.5666,2.5545,1.6832,5.0071,1.867,0.7864,2.9196,2.8759,1.5431,3.1038,5.7632,1.6955,1.5908,4.8249,1.9044,1.7053,4.4529,1.2824,2.8799,0.4001,0.7903,4.6924,3.5813,4.914,1.1137,1.8655,0.0002,2.762,4.25,5.2038,5.5994,1.0402,2.3625,0.0002,5.652,5.3518,2.5583,2.4835,2.886,2.8267,1.8148,4.7074,3.1718,6.3303,0.9762,3.1109,3.313,4.0544,5.3107,4.2817,1.3825,1.466,3.6897,0.0771,0.7912,3.7162,2.2601,6.5553,0.1173,1.2298,2.1847,3.9953,2.8731,6.9773,0.1492,4.9016,1.3685,1.2047,2.7316,0.373,1.7652,0.6243,1.3518,4.4976,1.5148,0.598,4.097,3.4729,0.8093,0.6339,4.0062,3.2256,5.2984,2.9073,1.5637,8.4619,2.0459,3.2887,2.0246,1.9379,1.6644,0.5513,4.1667,1.453,2.5097,4.507,1.0478,2.6239,3.6337,2.0856,1.4524,2.5801,3.7481,2.5605,0.0371,1.6269,0.3521,4.2523,2.3569,2.1527,1.2006,0.0156,4.2283,0.0774,4.8062,1.9502,1.6722,2.0232,2.7289,0.6216,5.1535,3.0491,5.058,2.6986,4.661,1.9271,5.2461,0.5793,3.9372,2.4236,2.433,2.988,0.0234,0.36,0.7441,1.8457,4.5143,0.4476,3.4114,0.8552,4.4385,4.1715,2.0631,0.6869,1.7925,4.9744,1.9792,1.5271,1.1518,1.6032,0.1419,1.0035,0.1006,4.3354,0.7574,0.9792,0.3522,4.2248,2.409,9.1157,10.1593,2.6341,0.0051,0.0004,4.1949,0.008,8.6982,4.0088,2.7152,6.455,0.2047,6.8834,1.1613,1.4196,2.5343,0.5996,0.001,0.0038,1.012,0.0028,0.3257,1.7013,2.2384,0.1411,0.655,0.0943,3.6164,0.1678,3.6094,1.788,0.2226,9.3466,1.7012,0.0587,3.1738,0.1526,0.5134,1.9188,0.0002,6.1769,3.9939,3.6284,1.4673,1.7158,5.4743,3.0842,2.4336,1.3143,2.9237,0.1543,0.3226,0.4534,0.496,1.2825,5.9462,4.3762,0.1442,1.9216,0.0447,0.511,4.6448,6.1328,7.4656,5.4079,0.0003,5.5174,2.4037,2.5269,1.7896,1.2258,1.0939,1.5513,1.0785,7.5648,5.8049,5.1546,6.2541,0.7705,1.9325,3.9552,2.9275,1.7815,5.8379,0.6128,2.4677,4.802,3.6063,1.8353,3.9379,1.3067,2.5169,1.6655,3.8987,5.2362,3.3128,5.2901,0.2545,0.0468,1.9827,1.2827,5.6894,2.7278,4.5784,5.0645,5.8468,2.779,1.2201,1.9576,1.2516,1.0381,8.2896,2.2009,1.1798,4.7859,0.2949,5.1889,4.3705,2.1692,2.4688,5.8299,0.1118,1.8433,3.6229,4.1267,0.6344,0.0003,0.2762,4.3051,0.2107,0.0448,0.2771,0.0002,2.2949,3.5107,0.1874,2.44,1.8999,3.3139,0.9372,4.0976,0.2864,5.3805,1.8152,0.0255,2.3315,2.1327,3.2397,2.1804,3.5191,4.7672,2.2115,1.0126,4.6561,2.8524,0.8523,0.8293,3.3769,1.578,3.5173,4.3638,4.0197,1.7438,6.1934,1.6204,0.2049,1.0421,0.5841,1.1567,1.2943,6.1011,2.6035,2.2039,3.9898,5.2321,1.3308,3.8442,3.9434,3.9373,0.2245,4.9162,3.6977,1.1174,0.0147,2.4821,6.1832,0.1383,1.3759,1.4919,1.6126,2.6603,8.0534,0.0093,0.2868,0.3858,0.448,1.052,3.738,0.9835,5.063,0.5777,0.1997,5.5944,1.2377,5.0146,1.257,5.23,4.4356,6.2083,4.2038,0.4112,0.596,2.2249,4.8662,1.4261,1.9311,3.1482,0.9515,3.343,1.6292,4.011,0.3404]}
{"id":2080,"ended":true,"length":424,"text":"Describe a dystopia with an unusually mundane \u2018 gimmick \u2019.\n\nThe book The Giver by Lois Lowry follows a society that has been \"deprived of emotions, values, knowledge, meaning, or purpose.\" There are no heroes, no conflicts, and no \"quirks\"; no wonder that those of the community remember the beginning of their society as \"the best of all possible worlds\" (pg. 6).\n\nThis novel is written during a time when the US is experiencing a significant financial and technological decline. The nation faces two major social problems: unemployment and declining population. People turn to the government to address these problems and it responds by providing free food. The government then removes people's ability to create their own food and money as a way of combating crime.\n\nThere are few characters in this novel that are not either in or on the brink of death. The main protagonist, Jonas, is dying of a terminal illness. Most of the other characters include his parents, his siblings, his friends, and his classmates, or people that have known him throughout his life. Jonas' brother finds and brings him the memory of his life as one of the first 12 children. The rest of the book details what happens in the rest of his life.\n\nDuring Jonas' time living in a community, almost everyone is content. Life is pretty stable and predictable, except when they encounter \u201cthe Giver\u201d --a mysterious person who comes to give information and advice to the children. According to the book, the Giver only sees the good in the community, so everything in the book is viewed positively. It seems like the residents in the community have been living in such bliss for so long that this isn\u2019t unusual to them, and it takes extreme circumstances to make them realize what they have lost.\n\nThe Giver is a fictional story of \u201ctotal conformity to a pre-determined form\u201d that has been heavily criticized. Many people, mainly liberals, believe that it promotes excessive conformity and that in the end it is \u201cthe dystopia of a stagnant mind.\u201d Some people argue that the story could be viewed as a warning against authoritarian leadership and lack of individual thought.","token_len":454,"entropy":[8.2919,2.5971,11.8564,0.4928,3.7666,3.1489,7.2545,7.305,15.1108,6.5791,12.2023,3.9502,7.3205,3.1728,1.0615,0.0036,3.0561,5.3644,6.7602,6.4714,3.7641,3.3672,7.7706,1.6923,6.486,1.7203,7.3039,1.6818,2.1926,1.7344,5.6675,6.3756,0.7778,0.7101,9.4517,1.8814,6.5298,0.3679,5.2213,0.394,5.8341,0.3923,2.6697,3.7563,1.4373,4.9202,0.9354,1.777,4.8413,0.8085,0.6381,8.1603,0.4003,1.5869,0.5267,4.5322,7.1849,1.9582,0.2946,5.2622,3.2429,6.2702,2.5713,5.111,4.4593,3.9329,5.3412,8.3823,1.8379,6.6871,0.3657,2.3594,5.0784,1.5885,2.2954,2.6698,5.2204,2.0299,2.4209,1.7204,0.0259,3.0327,1.8733,8.0949,0.4575,4.0706,0.8801,1.9124,0.0003,3.493,4.0113,1.4311,4.3225,5.7406,1.2741,0.499,0.5045,1.9145,5.2136,2.1363,3.5316,1.263,4.8398,4.8518,4.3682,3.0441,2.7865,0.9606,1.6079,4.7735,4.8283,4.9476,1.1382,4.1247,1.8283,0.9652,3.8892,0.6213,3.5144,4.6542,0.8265,5.6141,6.4254,0.1361,2.3357,3.2934,1.5804,4.2961,0.9645,0.4535,2.3117,4.3536,6.3128,1.2164,3.1874,4.1769,3.6948,4.1881,1.6402,1.0278,3.5234,6.9932,2.7689,3.4834,4.3225,0.0085,5.5771,2.9313,0.0433,2.9393,1.8306,5.8285,4.7831,1.6485,2.4044,0.9368,5.1756,5.2378,1.0604,1.3573,0.0003,4.1545,0.7306,3.9996,3.0042,1.4424,1.2483,0.8794,1.6924,1.4451,2.8571,6.3447,3.9586,4.6464,5.3973,0.5406,4.2893,0.0133,2.2586,0.4915,2.0532,3.7793,2.4122,1.2533,8.5297,0.9339,0.5841,5.5189,0.7449,1.9263,3.0051,0.799,1.1964,6.534,0.6937,0.3957,2.4922,0.3617,6.4357,5.0614,2.6489,0.7181,1.6621,2.5841,0.1318,1.0321,2.2936,0.2072,0.833,0.859,5.2745,2.3279,6.0838,4.8575,3.1948,2.0188,5.5171,0.4355,5.2541,0.5052,0.3449,0.3465,3.3934,3.2449,5.1077,7.306,5.5528,5.4119,0.6423,4.1144,7.8041,0.3114,0.6243,4.7004,3.0139,5.2045,0.2885,0.5497,3.1545,8.635,2.396,3.3759,2.2291,3.7915,0.2523,0.1976,2.9199,5.3147,3.7705,1.9607,3.2034,0.9224,6.0163,0.0368,2.1152,0.2008,1.5076,0.5787,0.0002,5.7069,2.7116,0.1968,3.6511,4.5441,0.8436,2.1537,4.108,2.0505,7.3126,1.4346,1.7239,7.3926,2.3789,5.9436,0.6655,5.0667,6.3422,1.8195,5.8184,1.3544,2.33,3.1064,3.8221,4.4472,12.5526,5.0576,4.9307,6.3293,0.0266,3.2062,8.2578,9.022,6.0423,4.5838,3.3952,0.8225,4.9606,0.9981,6.1278,4.1382,2.5359,2.9259,0.9349,1.1928,4.4773,0.6278,6.4471,0.0013,0.8368,2.1304,0.1784,1.1919,0.3585,0.0084,6.1464,4.1299,1.3771,6.132,1.1468,1.3233,3.9266,1.4972,3.8275,5.2176,3.1881,0.907,3.8676,0.5419,7.0018,4.4038,0.7768,3.6045,3.075,2.1955,1.7897,7.3891,4.1626,0.5419,0.2114,2.3895,2.3992,4.0664,1.4151,3.5985,6.4924,1.1981,2.0162,0.1274,0.4084,4.7145,5.1062,9.6165,5.8436,0.4131,3.9718,4.1885,1.4054,2.5497,1.5129,2.1558,6.0905,7.9567,5.65,0.5685,2.04,1.6103,4.3088,3.0084,1.2505,1.9003,4.7243,0.3426,0.572,0.0003,1.2723,1.1278,0.0016,1.4226,1.8908,4.4916,2.4436,2.6919,8.4011,1.177,7.8995,7.9401,3.6101,3.1214,7.1631,0.3151,3.5952,0.0428,5.6621,3.8487,5.0167,2.6661,2.583,1.2566,7.0529,3.2943,2.2663,4.0173,1.5243,3.7307,6.6838,4.2908,0.4642,2.1171,0.3062,2.8303,7.0515,7.7723,1.5184,1.565,2.2423,5.5215,2.3797,0.9956,1.6248,1.2469,6.5519,0.4215,1.9428,8.4309,0.1572,1.5914,3.3966,9.6627,9.1705,1.2323,7.5136,5.3602,4.05,2.0263,3.8586,0.0767,1.3155,3.4537,5.1648,0.7069,5.5567,0.2653,1.0207,4.8082,2.7245,4.8385,7.0108,1.5812,6.1862,0.0605,4.2986,5.2931,0.7318]}

As the title suggests, it is the story of a slave-boy who is transformed into a champion through the kindness of the slaver.\n\nPlot\nKing Pelasgus is one of the greatest slavers and has kidnapped a boy and sold him in his kingdom. That night, the boy has a nightmare. He is then visited by a man who calls himself the Lord of the Slaves and promises the boy his freedom as long as he kills the king. The slaver is angry that the boy has come to harm the king, but a sorceress comes to his aid and turns the slaver and his son into stones. The boy is then adopted by the sorceress, who has transformed all of their slaves into stone also. The boy is given a boat with a dragon inside and is allowed to escape. He then travels to a town to teach the people magic and he is befriended by a shepherd named Pesto. Eventually Pesto is transformed into a stone and as well.\n\nThe main character, a boy named Pesto, arrives in the court of another king named Pelasgus and asks to be allowed to live with him. Pelasgus agrees, only on the condition that Pesto kills his master. At first, both Pesto and Pelasgus are afraid to do so, but Pesto begins to warm to Pelasgus and the two end up becoming friends. On the day of the killing, Pesto kills Pelasgus and becomes a hero. After the battle, the Lord of the Slaves appears, but the boy tricks him into turning into a stone, and the slaver falls into the sea. On his way home, the boy kills any slave he comes across, and even kills his best friend in the process. In the end, he turns to a king named Amadis to tell him the history of his new kingdom, and the Lord of the Slaves and his Boy ends.\n\nReferences\n\nLiterature\n\nExternal links","token_len":457,"entropy":[9.3853,5.549,4.1688,3.5084,8.0749,4.2396,0.0113,2.2335,0.9339,0.2447,1.4023,0.2151,0.0549,3.1657,2.3649,6.9737,1.8515,0.9968,5.451,1.3271,10.5027,2.9977,0.0521,2.7227,6.8255,3.3787,1.2938,3.4529,3.1284,0.0357,1.7742,9.1741,1.5455,1.175,4.8789,2.8148,2.6492,5.2337,7.8882,1.3143,4.9027,1.9113,2.5808,0.7457,0.115,1.2923,1.1206,2.9822,2.4006,0.0321,0.7365,4.6828,2.5541,3.7595,1.1401,1.9774,5.1495,0.4034,0.2748,8.351,5.8867,1.4178,6.1652,0.2082,2.3821,4.4494,0.2882,0.9511,1.7475,0.0003,7.7195,1.0652,22.2681,7.5674,3.3047,3.1231,2.064,2.9775,5.375,0.1653,0.315,3.9496,4.5674,0.2026,4.0178,3.6301,7.0183,2.28,3.2534,2.8124,3.8105,0.3089,3.8214,2.7138,4.6764,0.9168,6.3409,3.418,0.4596,1.643,0.9701,3.9409,1.8583,3.9858,1.9162,1.462,1.7012,4.9082,6.8593,0.0527,1.18,3.2689,1.3257,5.2412,0.428,1.7324,3.677,0.701,0.9356,1.7503,1.1628,2.1613,3.697,3.6997,0.4078,2.0227,1.1286,4.6016,1.6746,0.0147,0.1697,4.743,1.1388,3.5085,0.548,1.3071,3.746,0.1428,2.5999,4.9717,2.3915,0.8575,0.4047,1.9763,5.0938,0.6853,4.8548,2.9602,0.6827,1.4739,1.18,5.3058,7.9519,0.0221,3.4478,0.6168,1.7495,0.2674,0.7956,4.8642,1.4344,4.137,0.0241,4.4684,0.3679,2.8559,0.4888,9.276,0.4911,1.0584,1.3737,1.1561,2.4974,6.6464,0.5436,0.7238,2.6415,0.0006,1.4515,1.0969,3.2509,4.3234,5.9669,1.1513,4.3186,3.0983,0.0877,0.9931,10.2443,0.3439,1.3949,1.3114,1.2092,3.3555,1.3178,7.5893,3.7901,1.0906,5.9873,5.8248,1.3446,1.9468,4.4698,0.1525,4.2527,1.162,2.6594,2.4647,3.9198,0.529,2.5095,3.4187,3.8235,5.3267,0.6355,4.4939,6.7755,1.1906,4.7777,1.5007,6.6964,0.0022,0.0165,0.9479,8.0729,1.072,4.5348,4.5924,3.6005,0.6926,4.9126,3.5782,0.0015,0.0004,2.3969,5.8381,0.1699,0.4284,1.9819,1.688,6.0835,5.5607,4.1647,1.1956,0.0002,1.6102,5.5165,0.9286,2.3687,3.332,2.1309,0.1793,3.6513,0.3404,0.0119,0.3043,5.5965,1.2908,1.1158,6.7868,0.3948,6.7502,1.2166,3.6767,2.801,0.1728,0.1912,0.009,1.2838,3.2034,2.5101,1.0835,3.6496,0.2958,2.2819,1.3639,0.4317,0.4488,2.934,0.0039,0.004,0.0011,3.3514,1.7474,5.3559,6.005,1.5106,0.0867,0.1429,2.1828,0.0017,0.0016,6.4749,2.5053,2.6545,1.0634,4.8773,2.4409,0.9323,5.9892,2.7478,0.0044,0.0082,0.0271,3.5289,0.0044,0.0049,0.0005,1.2752,3.9164,2.8663,3.0084,0.7542,1.0524,0.4371,3.6258,0.0026,0.0014,5.4614,0.1525,7.4067,0.7681,4.3534,0.0038,0.0047,0.0004,1.0686,2.8128,0.7899,5.0407,0.0861,3.4472,0.9143,0.3258,5.9129,0.8241,2.2382,0.8179,0.5022,5.0254,0.4989,1.432,0.0043,0.0028,4.3957,2.1893,0.0025,0.0094,0.001,1.1131,4.2094,1.9041,3.5728,1.4162,3.4013,1.4681,3.5036,0.3262,1.654,6.1941,0.157,0.054,0.051,0.0067,4.6791,2.5856,3.7965,2.0249,1.2894,10.7881,0.6144,0.5602,4.228,1.5835,0.5501,0.523,2.6249,1.964,1.8941,3.1081,0.0301,4.761,1.3217,1.0428,1.3218,0.5081,5.7214,2.1613,0.6136,3.492,0.1386,1.1368,0.4131,5.678,7.6684,4.158,1.5241,3.3211,0.3064,1.508,1.036,5.4801,3.7944,2.0627,4.9265,0.0788,4.1977,0.7747,0.3554,0.1145,4.1885,0.7544,0.7125,0.0736,2.3421,4.5486,3.7081,2.7308,4.9313,1.022,5.5755,4.1669,2.7282,2.9263,4.3863,0.2334,2.1919,5.5851,0.0844,1.6558,4.0926,1.2899,1.8084,0.7866,1.9555,3.2376,0.1805,0.0454,0.0149,0.0198,4.2364,1.1923,5.075,6.2358,7.0549,0.3033,0.0002,5.4131,1.0737,0.0005,6.4118,0.0278,0.2312,0.0004,5.861,0.744]}
{"id":2744,"ended":true,"length":429,"text":"Archaeologists have unearthed what remains of Pandora's Box. It is open and empty, save for something lodged in the corner.\n\nThe object is a small cylindrical vessel with a dark blue lid. The box itself has rusted, and its hinges have collapsed. This means that whoever opened up the box is long since dead. But there are no remains of those persons. We must assume that they died from the contents of Pandora's Box, and that nothing, not even this box, could save them.\n\nThe Pandora and the Box story was a legend that was popularized in the Greek mythopoeic epic the Iliad. The story begins that Hera had the gods create humanity. Once they had done so, she asked them to craft a powerful weapon that would be used to destroy humanity. She then locked it inside a chest and gave it to the Titans to guard.\n\nThe gods then sent the mortal Zeus to find the Box. When he did, he discovered that Pandora had stolen it. She claimed that she was given it as a gift by the gods, but Zeus had other ideas. He sent Heracles to retrieve the Box. At first he destroyed Pandora's house, but she made a new one. Soon the two went to war, as well as their sons. Zeus won their war by turning Heracles into a swine, but at the cost of one of his eyes and both his right arms. Later Zeus punished Heracles for this by having him wander around the earth in chains, muttering to himself all the time.\n\nThis box was then a sacred relic of the Titans. The Titans would open it at sacred times, and release its powers, destroying the mortals with their own creations. Sometimes they would steal it and hide it away, but when they were being hunted down, they would open it and release the power. This was often the cause of the Titans'destruction.

{"id":2442,"ended":true,"length":429,"text":"Archaeologists have unearthed what remains of Pandora's Box. It is open and empty, save for something lodged in the corner.\n\nThe object is a small cylindrical vessel with a dark blue lid. The box itself has rusted, and its hinges have collapsed. This means that whoever opened up the box is long since dead. But there are no remains of those persons. We must assume that they died from the contents of Pandora's Box, and that nothing, not even this box, could save them.\n\nThe Pandora and the Box story was a legend that was popularized in the Greek mythopoeic epic the Iliad. The story begins that Hera had the gods create humanity. Once they had done so, she asked them to craft a powerful weapon that would be used to destroy humanity. She then locked it inside a chest and gave it to the Titans to guard.\n\nThe gods then sent the mortal Zeus to find the Box. When he did, he discovered that Pandora had stolen it. She claimed that she was given it as a gift by the gods, but Zeus had other ideas. He sent Heracles to retrieve the Box. At first he destroyed Pandora's house, but she made a new one. Soon the two went to war, as well as their sons. Zeus won their war by turning Heracles into a swine, but at the cost of one of his eyes and both his right arms. Later Zeus punished Heracles for this by having him wander around the earth in chains, muttering to himself all the time.\n\nThis box was then a sacred relic of the Titans. The Titans would open it at sacred times, and release its powers, destroying the mortals with their own creations. Sometimes they would steal it and hide it away, but when they were being hunted down, they would open it and release the power. This was often the cause of the Titans'destruction. The humans fought back, and eventually beat them all. The myth then takes a tragic turn, ending with the death of all the Gods, as well as Pandora and Heracles. So it is now safe to say that Pandora's Box is now completely empty. Unless, however, you count the lost relic in the corner.","token_len":457,"entropy":[8.0313,1.2421,1.6649,3.7712,4.2698,5.138,0.078,10.3329,0.5722,1.4753,2.5421,3.2817,1.5437,7.0639,3.7104,6.1699,0.9651,6.4389,0.1196,6.62,7.8175,0.6143,0.5891,5.0435,0.9036,1.2144,0.0034,1.8705,6.1813,1.3789,2.1192,3.3043,4.2584,0.0003,0.0,5.5006,1.8503,0.7615,6.7808,2.1243,4.0179,0.9959,1.595,5.6948,3.9811,2.0711,7.6272,0.2282,3.1801,2.9782,3.3554,5.4978,1.2716,4.5944,0.4666,4.126,4.1365,0.7143,6.4092,3.7845,6.2661,0.4493,0.8246,2.8166,8.801,4.7129,0.8398,0.3373,4.2886,3.1372,1.3915,2.1685,4.2636,0.6799,5.1471,7.9618,1.2392,5.3906,4.9765,3.0163,0.289,2.0753,3.2852,2.5911,3.0394,7.1631,0.2519,1.7366,0.0324,0.0438,1.6929,1.7142,1.084,6.3184,5.7979,2.1445,0.1695,5.4999,1.6162,0.3944,2.2088,6.035,0.2684,0.2067,0.6902,0.0002,1.8965,6.5499,6.6096,1.6212,4.3271,6.4962,3.3427,3.2837,5.0486,2.7995,2.3591,3.1611,2.3175,1.934,1.3196,5.8055,2.9665,8.1515,0.3493,2.8016,4.766,5.7944,5.2412,0.064,0.0054,0.6941,1.6764,1.9097,3.4263,6.6245,6.6357,3.3404,4.1111,6.3311,4.8573,8.0475,2.7132,5.4916,2.4451,0.4492,3.3331,0.4602,0.1001,2.7095,4.2662,1.947,0.2908,6.1291,0.6001,5.5879,2.0651,1.6863,0.5536,3.411,1.9505,0.7509,2.1001,2.9954,0.3581,3.1418,2.6071,7.617,2.1595,2.2208,1.8116,4.2296,2.2671,3.7882,0.5102,0.1586,1.0149,6.9201,2.9246,5.7544,0.5908,1.5843,0.0002,1.4912,5.4264,2.6712,2.5557,1.9103,7.4373,8.4297,0.714,3.604,0.8512,4.4508,1.1356,2.8613,0.9847,2.4492,0.3846,1.0536,2.4488,0.7603,2.698,1.1583,4.935,1.2713,1.0321,2.9956,5.2741,0.8187,1.0874,2.1759,6.1429,1.3617,2.314,0.3577,0.2537,1.8941,1.4198,1.0045,1.1834,1.3749,3.5832,3.379,6.2631,2.1594,0.4561,1.1233,3.2913,7.3653,1.5795,0.5776,3.3992,0.7549,0.8599,1.6932,5.1731,1.0422,3.2918,8.5315,3.398,0.6085,8.5667,0.6955,0.3715,2.3887,5.3248,1.8587,2.9803,0.1445,1.3093,4.9212,2.3644,4.4226,3.7272,1.4827,2.9858,1.3348,4.565,2.9469,0.4045,4.0067,5.2742,0.9702,3.3595,5.1446,4.7721,1.0942,2.9564,4.9431,3.5,0.0034,0.6117,0.4843,7.9061,0.7598,1.3475,1.7416,5.4534,0.8202,1.4868,0.0052,5.2821,0.8284,1.8602,6.7,2.6401,6.0838,1.2133,6.4651,5.0023,0.2204,5.3162,3.1095,6.8476,0.6743,0.0008,1.1672,2.1489,2.9841,4.7149,1.1159,7.9774,2.3185,0.8067,3.5921,2.6254,4.6721,1.5881,5.9043,1.4995,1.7674,0.1567,5.9481,1.3889,1.095,0.9306,0.6903,0.0002,3.5992,7.6533,1.4423,4.03,6.8521,5.2374,2.8957,1.9274,1.1984,3.8334,0.8921,2.1375,2.9832,3.4456,5.5361,0.7454,4.0392,7.6289,1.1069,1.1691,1.2257,6.8217,3.0867,5.9909,2.8349,5.2415,1.2986,6.5077,4.588,1.556,1.9649,5.4243,0.1867,5.7505,1.8886,0.5387,5.4247,1.1771,1.7694,6.0282,0.1808,3.5218,1.8804,1.3344,4.4354,0.8147,3.0322,8.4874,1.6464,1.8242,1.0568,0.6777,0.2673,2.1312,0.4884,1.3305,2.4074,1.7005,1.8752,2.5218,2.7099,1.5975,4.3966,2.4231,4.8216,0.2547,1.277,2.6697,14.8843,11.6122,12.6559,0.934,2.4365,6.2263,5.6557,1.995,0.9979,1.3309,2.3464,8.9779,1.5674,3.4688,1.6095,2.2175,7.1805,5.1121,5.7165,1.8957,5.0638,0.081,1.8157,6.717,0.6898,0.9503,3.5842,0.0182,4.6802,1.4926,4.18,2.2956,3.3731,0.4215,0.0143,3.6797,2.1506,3.1896,0.0077,0.2953,6.8146,2.4316,1.0124,4.2519,6.9868,0.2319,0.4492,0.0904,1.8546,0.925,0.1311,0.9162,3.0084,4.9786,1.9454,0.5317,7.9109,3.2983,6.4092,0.0261,1.1561,6.2876,0.7591,5.7284,8.2662,2.647,0.7241,6.8251,0.9559]}
{"id":3128,"ended":true,"length":430,"text":"A demon grants you three curses to send to your enemies. It warns you however, that it will try it \u2019 s damnedest to turn the curse into something positive for the recipient.\n\nThe demon is a male, middle aged, with a long bushy white beard. Its head is black, and its mouth is a fang. It has brown eyes, and is well dressed in purple brocade robes, with silver sash. The demon speaks in a voice which sounds like a mixture of a man and a woman.\n\nIt holds a book in one hand, and a rod in the other. In one of it \u2018 s hands he has two scrolls, one bound, the other loose. In the other hand he has a wand.\n\nIt speaks in a very old language, not as old as its beard, but at least a thousand years old. Its voice is deep and hoarse, much like that of a blacksmith. Even in its dreams the demon is powerful.\n\nYou can choose one of the curses you were bestowed, or one you found lying about. It will try to do the worst thing possible, and then it will try to turn the curse back and work for the good.\n\nThe demon will try its hardest to help, and will guide you through the battle.\n\nIt will not harm anyone, except those who are responsible for the spell going wrong. Its power is not at all to be trifled with : the caster alone has the power to banish it, and only use it when needed.\n\nThe best thing to do is to allow the demon to complete both curses, and then destroy it after completing the second curse. The first curse will not be effective by the way, since the demons power is greater than any curse.\n\nWhen it is too late, it will turn the curse to gold, and then try to destroy all the gold on the world, killing all those who are connected to it. This will of course kill everyone, but it will then try to turn the curse to stone, and turn the world into a garden. It is important to get rid of it before it completes it task, otherwise this will be the end of reality as we know it.","token_len":457,"entropy":[10.8623,10.7472,1.6373,5.6423,6.7334,3.54,7.3749,2.3963,1.0977,2.9336,0.7877,3.9802,9.3449,0.5325,9.8398,1.7478,0.6353,3.2099,1.5668,4.9733,7.8761,14.6761,6.9638,9.1764,12.022,2.84,1.7273,5.3185,2.8981,5.5651,1.4868,2.6627,4.8982,2.9882,2.1327,7.1159,1.0967,1.9742,0.0327,2.8303,2.2695,2.2768,2.2826,6.7891,4.6028,6.4633,1.7779,2.0164,4.4126,1.4411,2.9149,8.3173,0.0038,4.2186,0.6185,1.2716,3.2285,3.0262,0.4989,3.5869,1.5395,1.2816,0.921,3.5368,0.4786,2.8413,6.4786,2.3904,1.462,1.2893,1.3354,5.4717,0.5515,1.0561,1.5912,2.9555,5.734,4.2918,2.0367,5.3032,9.1921,0.1576,2.6081,2.6184,1.7445,4.9885,5.58,0.7709,3.385,2.2051,0.8243,5.7304,1.4486,0.8501,5.0537,3.1908,3.0026,0.876,1.3359,5.8877,0.0356,2.8634,4.2738,1.4239,0.2339,0.1968,0.7487,1.262,0.0003,2.45,6.2743,0.662,5.9181,2.8194,1.8792,0.0367,1.1453,0.7983,0.5137,6.2323,0.3826,0.0493,0.0011,0.2535,3.5947,2.3071,3.2986,6.0483,9.4114,5.4993,4.0157,3.5879,3.3655,2.6252,2.8254,4.4583,1.5869,0.931,7.2256,3.8952,2.1697,0.1125,7.4076,0.7076,1.8501,0.5592,0.3204,1.6634,0.9144,0.4679,0.9237,3.6215,1.8825,1.5748,0.0003,1.954,3.9909,0.8588,0.5227,3.89,4.9871,1.742,1.062,5.3911,4.7553,3.6816,0.0455,3.2352,11.7423,0.954,0.5224,5.2562,0.4334,2.7123,4.5398,0.3755,0.3559,0.4228,2.1988,2.5058,0.3667,4.4339,0.5328,6.1802,0.0042,0.7277,6.3146,0.4974,1.9647,0.0553,0.5623,6.501,1.3677,1.2436,6.7554,2.4782,1.2576,6.0628,2.82,0.4532,1.7599,6.8279,1.2696,0.8595,0.0003,4.9042,1.6618,3.0654,1.9129,0.1668,0.9355,3.0447,1.8269,7.2351,7.6636,3.1793,1.6753,2.639,3.1575,6.7925,7.2952,3.6536,1.6351,2.9528,1.1832,3.3142,0.8695,4.3472,1.6622,5.2077,3.12,2.0828,1.9746,1.3911,3.0652,2.1595,0.3006,2.9683,0.5587,2.9513,1.5933,0.8764,3.4906,5.1738,7.1835,2.774,2.6772,2.3054,2.1832,0.7711,0.0004,2.0572,0.5868,2.0509,3.0201,3.8542,1.4474,0.3173,4.8209,3.1824,1.4394,2.6298,8.9528,0.2085,2.0867,1.209,5.4175,0.8541,1.2661,0.0004,2.8009,1.6169,3.3549,4.5942,3.3166,0.9737,3.9027,2.9148,0.7865,1.389,6.1883,0.4655,1.775,6.5793,7.7427,2.4829,0.3326,4.7252,4.1914,0.7303,3.2414,5.7072,0.528,5.1909,0.6933,6.5701,0.0201,0.0043,8.8313,3.091,5.8978,8.1285,2.7853,1.714,0.9576,0.2818,5.8897,0.005,1.8249,2.113,1.1736,3.9098,7.889,0.5314,2.2193,3.4874,0.2952,0.4307,0.0003,1.7804,6.8651,2.5129,1.5174,0.1217,0.653,0.4466,6.4101,0.7912,0.3313,0.1464,6.5349,7.1831,4.1133,1.7592,1.0804,1.954,5.2803,1.333,5.8028,5.0476,1.2907,3.1829,4.2409,0.3535,2.7244,3.3255,1.6353,1.1571,2.9801,1.9727,3.424,6.2049,2.2611,7.7058,0.8964,3.4033,1.2745,4.1793,6.1926,1.3348,4.6495,0.2943,2.8463,4.8021,2.2118,1.1044,0.0003,3.5452,3.0898,1.4897,5.6025,0.1529,0.5392,1.6895,0.1697,3.3569,1.6131,1.8019,3.0034,5.0681,0.9866,0.714,2.5041,4.3261,0.5226,3.0083,4.2086,1.3142,1.8286,3.619,0.8791,3.4013,2.3792,4.8334,1.9107,2.0511,0.5501,2.3899,5.4423,0.4961,0.5737,0.3272,3.554,0.8713,8.1485,0.0423,2.7258,2.664,2.0872,1.1642,1.2727,0.6698,5.6696,2.8078,0.2274,2.6993,0.7345,0.9847,2.1556,4.5889,0.9827,1.0889,4.7861,1.2032,3.7218,0.5492,0.769,6.5499,1.4416,3.0864,2.7081,4.8194,0.4788,4.9415,2.3418,0.0044,2.8547,1.189,0.5569,6.9884,4.4006,9.3545,1.1515,3.2739,4.4829,0.7814,2.0631,2.7907,0.5268,0.2539,9.3091,4.0172,1.439,0.1054,0.0011,0.1903]}

{"id":4600,"ended":true,"length":442,"text":"The first human spaceship capable of FTL flight reaches deep space and makes the most terrifying discovery in the history of mankind...\n\nThe Federation Ship, as it appears.\n\nThe Federation Ship is an inter-dimensional vessel designed by the Human Alliance for interstellar exploration. This experimental ship, constructed with the hopes of finding a \"fountain of youth\" on distant worlds, was named the Federation Ship for its supposed ability to travel at the speed of light. The Federation Ship was originally built with powerful warp drive capabilities and a shield generator to protect itself along with its crew.\n\nThe vessel was completed in 2049 only to be abandoned due to the human race's poor judgment of the galaxy and its propensity for war rather than exploration. With nearly two millennia worth of knowledge learned from Earth, the Federation Ship left its homebase in space to travel a hundred light years to New Eden to find a suitable colony in order for the Human Alliance and its inhabitants to flourish. The ship departed on its journey, but its plans were nearly forgotten once Earth launched an attack that brought the Human Alliance to civil war. With its mission of peace no longer an option and Earth seemingly in civil war, the Federation Ship took refuge in a vast void in the depths of space.\n\nHowever, while the crew survived in the vessel's sealed atmosphere within their protected home, their home was slowly destroyed from the outside. With their limited supplies of air being depleted, the Alliance and Humans of the federation set course for nearby New Eden for help.\n\nDespite the Federation Ship arriving to New Eden on schedule, both the human government and the Alliance were heavily engaged in the conflict near Earth and in the Battle of Eden Prime the Federation Ship was struck by the planet's devastating electromagnetic pulse.

{"id":3717,"ended":true,"length":442,"text":"The first human spaceship capable of FTL flight reaches deep space and makes the most terrifying discovery in the history of mankind...\n\nThe Federation Ship, as it appears.\n\nThe Federation Ship is an inter-dimensional vessel designed by the Human Alliance for interstellar exploration. This experimental ship, constructed with the hopes of finding a \"fountain of youth\" on distant worlds, was named the Federation Ship for its supposed ability to travel at the speed of light. The Federation Ship was originally built with powerful warp drive capabilities and a shield generator to protect itself along with its crew.\n\nThe vessel was completed in 2049 only to be abandoned due to the human race's poor judgment of the galaxy and its propensity for war rather than exploration. With nearly two millennia worth of knowledge learned from Earth, the Federation Ship left its homebase in space to travel a hundred light years to New Eden to find a suitable colony in order for the Human Alliance and its inhabitants to flourish. The ship departed on its journey, but its plans were nearly forgotten once Earth launched an attack that brought the Human Alliance to civil war. With its mission of peace no longer an option and Earth seemingly in civil war, the Federation Ship took refuge in a vast void in the depths of space.\n\nHowever, while the crew survived in the vessel's sealed atmosphere within their protected home, their home was slowly destroyed from the outside. With their limited supplies of air being depleted, the Alliance and Humans of the federation set course for nearby New Eden for help.\n\nDespite the Federation Ship arriving to New Eden on schedule, both the human government and the Alliance were heavily engaged in the conflict near Earth and in the Battle of Eden Prime the Federation Ship was struck by the planet's devastating electromagnetic pulse. The Federation Ship and most of its crew were completely destroyed. The surviving ship's shield generator was badly damaged as well but the ship managed to return home to the Human Alliance with little injuries to its crew.\n\nIn 2051 it was reported by a small team of scientists that due to the ship's shield generator's damage, it could now only be accessed in the \"warp bubble.\" That year engineers also reported that the ship's warp core had reached maximum levels of heat.

{"id":3484,"ended":true,"length":432,"text":"You are immortal. Over the course of the centuries you discover that reincarnation is real, and now you're searching all over the world for your first love.\nI would absolutely love to play that game. Not sure a game can be \"fun\" if it's meant to end, but a game that was just about time travel, and discovering what happens through \"fate\" (i.e. \"destiny\" if you follow Hinduism), would be cool.\nI dunno, I think the idea of finally finding \"the one\" and staying with her because you know you're never really going to live again...would be fun.   And then the cycle begins again.      Also, in certain Buddhist sects, there is a belief that all your past lives are already behind you in some cosmic sense, but you're still just starting to live a \"new\" life.\nI'd be happy with that.    I've had some interesting conversations with some Buddhists that really opened my eyes to their view.  I've been an atheist for a long time, and I think there's a certain level of irony in Buddhism that I find fascinating.\nI'm pretty much the exact opposite, Atheist to the core. But this idea of the universe being cyclic and all that I find...very appealing.  I mean, I wouldn't call myself a Buddhist at all, but that's more out of a lack of interest and time than anything else. I just really like the idea of reincarnation.\nIt's very much my philosophy. Everyone I know that's religious (like me) is an atheist. I've been an atheist since I was born. I actually believe in the cyclic universe.\nNice. I think I had some of my last philosophical thinking while on a retreat to a monastery.     If I ever had the chance to pursue a philosophical career, my focus would be on the idea of time, for sure. But it seems like there is always something else that pulls me in another direction, and I never even get as far as writing anything down in the first place.\nYes, me too! That's the thing. I like what's out there, but my curiosity gets the best of me.","token_len":465,"entropy":[3.8828,9.7944,1.4903,8.195,2.0792,1.9861,0.0033,1.9342,4.8425,2.7047,10.2506,2.0842,9.0817,0.1018,0.7784,5.2226,1.4331,1.1564,5.9237,0.762,2.7793,6.0863,6.4456,0.6329,0.2044,0.5541,0.5322,2.6662,4.8811,5.1638,0.5805,2.2541,8.6138,5.048,7.1282,0.8754,0.2083,4.9775,4.3284,1.3748,1.3713,5.8106,4.1368,7.2838,2.9422,3.2811,1.2971,5.9777,4.0439,0.9427,2.165,1.7756,1.0023,5.6843,0.1357,6.1986,4.005,0.3688,4.6475,1.0103,1.429,4.813,4.7341,2.7306,5.9851,4.6714,2.1348,2.1023,9.7021,3.1803,2.2088,5.7998,6.3125,4.9613,2.9892,1.3551,4.3008,3.5892,0.0121,0.0005,0.5479,4.3604,5.7935,0.4147,2.0779,5.573,0.3447,6.3262,12.6155,1.1739,2.2798,2.2216,0.4576,4.4994,0.3529,0.8093,2.1847,6.8186,1.0429,1.3826,3.3314,2.4361,3.1728,0.6014,8.1153,2.3405,4.1875,2.1509,3.6585,1.7702,2.9502,7.2766,1.4783,2.7764,4.5003,2.4995,3.3164,2.0271,0.9972,4.2747,3.284,2.2028,0.1037,5.6084,3.334,5.1351,4.1083,0.3618,3.2405,0.4968,5.6326,6.1613,5.0261,3.4975,3.3685,8.1267,3.6688,1.3596,0.8378,1.8222,1.1267,2.592,1.8961,1.1987,8.4821,0.547,4.8962,6.9182,9.2102,4.2209,0.6664,2.9547,1.2417,0.5157,4.2218,0.2293,3.4721,5.3144,3.6502,1.5462,0.9388,6.0476,5.941,0.1159,3.3774,1.0811,6.6718,2.9918,1.0143,2.7991,2.3775,2.109,2.0158,4.6026,5.3059,1.3753,3.2926,3.7214,4.0031,3.1858,1.1145,0.1006,0.8251,2.2206,1.7583,3.4135,2.9008,2.6641,2.8338,0.9932,0.6637,1.3011,0.2404,0.9398,2.8884,4.0117,3.6453,2.6361,3.7187,2.6311,0.3344,2.2007,5.7158,0.0045,3.4684,4.5001,5.7512,0.8923,0.4746,0.6437,3.6025,4.7555,1.8747,0.763,4.8863,2.1899,2.2099,5.8623,1.9961,0.9389,1.3297,1.366,0.0324,0.7393,0.692,1.0793,2.6771,3.1239,0.8035,0.9172,3.8195,3.2875,0.0258,4.9814,1.151,5.2672,0.8422,2.0709,2.2323,5.1128,0.5567,2.0876,1.5434,2.1156,3.9474,3.1771,3.5634,4.6396,0.3637,2.8755,9.3466,0.4424,6.9314,3.1106,6.0116,0.5705,5.2127,4.1858,3.602,0.8969,3.3534,4.016,1.3187,8.537,3.3433,2.1044,3.6796,3.1474,5.1379,3.3089,7.6598,5.7561,3.3254,0.4728,0.8496,4.0616,3.3152,0.2056,1.4319,4.9674,0.0007,4.2191,2.0508,0.7481,1.9281,3.9548,0.0713,0.7826,0.3945,3.2778,0.6703,5.4911,7.3935,0.0937,2.5818,4.8815,0.0017,2.2062,3.8641,6.8204,3.0772,0.4952,1.558,0.3063,2.361,3.0943,3.9307,1.1586,1.1733,0.5204,0.275,3.141,0.0277,0.8963,1.7517,3.3998,0.6151,3.9562,3.1999,3.9754,4.0606,1.3718,7.9851,2.8024,0.7912,4.0252,1.8991,5.4091,4.2273,3.8838,1.6478,0.5195,1.7407,4.4302,0.3001,0.8273,1.6589,2.7019,1.9384,2.73,0.0793,2.7891,0.484,0.029,6.1469,0.9709,1.0714,5.6376,2.5871,0.7952,2.7843,9.4752,1.0811,3.0538,1.5098,2.8054,10.6022,1.8044,2.1693,2.572,1.7765,5.8975,2.1725,4.2735,1.2912,6.2292,5.5156,6.1497,5.3047,3.723,1.7533,5.3067,3.9432,3.4321,1.8151,1.7561,1.3277,0.7304,1.2519,1.05,5.6179,1.2843,3.5798,3.3389,2.4869,0.6665,0.425,7.0761,2.2285,2.7687,2.6495,0.6978,4.9103,4.275,0.1431,0.3407,0.6317,1.968,3.4159,0.4359,4.9229,4.7067,6.0402,3.4972,0.3865,2.1413,2.8502,3.1227,0.7488,2.3409,2.6234,4.4639,1.6254,2.6853,1.8784,8.2698,0.5128,0.7062,5.8956,0.0393,1.5685,1.1353,1.4025,5.193,5.1545,3.2993,7.6096,0.659,0.4844,4.643,4.7686,4.4692,3.7243,2.0838,1.4564,0.0177,0.1774,1.2364,5.8002,0.3137,8.0955,1.0803,2.9319,4.9451,0.5103,2.8237,2.2725,1.6127,1.2797,3.4482,5.2609,3.8598,3.7496,0.022,1.5321,1.9741,4.4083,6.8308,4.5474,1.0925,0.4064,0.0404,0.02,1.0162]}

Start with a song title, and run wild...\n\nTitles from the movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding will help define the tone of the main character, an ethnic Greek. If it's a romance, look at Greek songs that touch on themes of passion, love and romance. For horror, look at dark Greek folk songs for inspiration. If it's a coming-of-age story, pick up that book or go to YouTube and learn a Greek folk song.\n\nAs in the books, song titles will inspire you and help take the story where you intended it to go. When you first write this script, simply write it to the song. But as your imagination grows as you work, put those songs away and look for different inspiration. Look at the book of song titles for the inspiration you need now, then come up with something that hasn't been used in any script before. Your book should be something new and original in its own right.\n\nBy doing so, you will gain ideas that will help you write the best story you can write, and you will add value to your own work as you write it.

The company was founded on December 16, 2003, by Adam Rifkin, Chris Aaronson, and Joseph A. Musso. Its goal is to tell the American story not often told. Its movies are made with independent producers, and generally in very low budget. Its first film was the 2005 film The Bum Next Door, which opened in limited release on October 5, 2005.\n\nContents\n\nIn November 2010, The Los Angeles Times had reported that Rifkin intended to follow The Bum Next Door with a sequel.[1] The project was announced with a cast that included Ben Stiller, Justin Timberlake, Josh Charles, Matt Lauer and Kate McKinnon.[2][3] In August 2013, Timberlake announced that he was no longer going to be in the film.[4] Lauer was then recruited to star in the movie.[5][6]\n\nThe first trailer and poster for the film were released on May 5, 2014\n\nOn February 24, 2014, Lauer announced that he was leaving the role as well.[7] Aaronson would direct the pic. Andrew Adamson wrote the original version of the screenplay.\n\nThe film was shot in Brooklyn and East Harlem. The set was a working public housing building in East Harlem.

The film was financed by 20th Century Fox, with the company getting a co-production and distribution deal for the film from Netflix in October 2013.","token_len":466,"entropy":[12.5031,9.804,1.4683,10.2129,0.4911,3.1397,8.1586,2.1788,1.8103,4.1863,12.2369,2.0723,0.0183,5.1492,2.1144,2.8042,0.0038,0.8784,10.3483,2.3663,3.41,0.5659,2.5587,7.774,0.7989,5.8901,9.6749,7.7987,1.8825,1.562,4.9575,1.9834,1.2811,0.0039,2.8737,5.9295,4.3149,3.2393,2.9001,2.7047,7.7811,2.4856,4.532,0.0972,1.6731,0.1599,1.9838,0.1233,0.2433,2.0254,2.2295,0.077,1.0882,1.7078,1.5456,2.4722,0.4167,3.2964,3.1206,3.6565,0.1379,4.4485,1.2203,1.2765,5.291,4.9178,5.7731,0.1825,0.8857,5.5256,5.5506,3.6681,0.2035,0.3177,1.4118,6.2629,4.4936,0.7503,7.7147,4.3493,0.6583,5.2582,3.756,0.3727,0.0443,5.9843,1.1231,4.906,0.2784,7.6941,8.4747,1.286,2.7576,3.9769,5.0168,1.018,3.6314,2.0147,4.767,4.4006,1.6012,1.8588,6.2261,4.4121,5.0725,1.6356,0.2831,1.1698,3.5031,4.2567,1.4626,1.9506,2.9254,5.7766,1.9525,2.2258,1.773,0.2705,9.3529,0.3371,1.0031,0.9537,4.3169,0.8343,5.847,0.4987,1.9134,3.0469,3.1759,0.2347,1.4173,0.3976,1.6616,0.0003,4.6238,4.8226,0.0002,5.0197,5.8557,4.0004,0.3227,2.8277,8.1065,0.3197,0.1161,5.4561,3.8921,0.5827,4.183,0.0302,0.0036,6.9478,0.1075,6.6512,3.8646,0.0709,0.0033,1.2937,0.0002,2.4408,1.1277,2.6835,6.8043,1.0455,0.0798,1.6057,3.7827,0.7982,4.1831,4.7402,1.3822,6.2442,2.5474,0.1063,4.9886,2.6777,0.0097,0.2377,5.7641,2.3035,0.0,0.0393,5.2052,6.3525,0.4265,4.872,3.2121,0.0275,3.1076,5.677,0.9484,0.0006,1.5931,0.0948,2.4932,0.0413,0.2293,2.8355,3.6944,3.0125,0.1632,7.9532,0.001,2.0854,0.8073,0.5537,0.7458,5.4388,0.0015,3.782,0.0881,1.42,3.0289,0.6209,0.9728,1.7044,0.0569,0.1384,6.0309,0.1293,2.8581,4.7124,7.0339,0.6907,2.0772,0.6901,0.5434,2.7426,1.2732,0.0991,2.0221,0.0196,0.2112,1.0221,0.0001,1.9551,3.8017,2.2597,5.3756,5.8489,0.4488,1.3694,0.4771,1.7195,0.1816,0.7322,2.8598,3.2434,0.0679,0.9651,7.4751,0.0002,3.4721,3.1468,3.224,0.0364,2.0003,0.2111,4.8083,0.0191,1.3814,0.5794,0.3281,0.7671,1.2967,0.9468,4.6739,4.0746,3.0195,1.1696,0.061,0.1865,3.4687,9.0478,0.0027,5.546,4.2784,0.8162,9.5713,2.1589,8.4246,8.3266,0.3783,3.5941,0.6984,5.1012,5.1824,0.6286,0.2661,2.1362,1.4632,1.6138,0.0001,1.7889,1.6121,1.3128,3.753,0.684,4.4619,2.3688,6.408,2.0279,1.7943,1.2391,5.0554,0.7613,3.792,5.8494,6.9555,1.1753,2.8836,2.0357,3.8126,0.1448,1.1189,1.0935,6.7828,0.8142,0.6129,4.2879,1.0801,4.69,1.6669,3.703,0.1609,1.0219,3.427,0.6119,3.4321,4.0354,7.2764,3.5784,2.4505,2.4413,1.9403,0.6299,1.7717,2.7852,0.0874,0.1585,1.1061,0.0001,5.4544,2.4728,0.6311,0.0153,0.529,0.0006,0.2468,1.8766,9.9184,5.5442,0.001,0.0255,2.7536,1.1396,3.4985,8.3371,3.7998,2.7534,4.4869,1.9532,1.5017,1.6164,8.5381,0.0104,0.0199,6.8583,5.8233,6.9484,1.7453,1.2565,5.244,3.0242,2.2966,2.765,8.1147,0.4077,0.3664,0.002,0.0172,4.9998,0.0672,0.9702,3.7633,0.0047,3.4023,3.3766,3.5628,4.7705,5.1952,0.037,1.5656,5.5585,3.0442,1.7357,5.2113,6.0746,0.0438,7.4361,15.8168,5.9096,7.5353,0.0022,0.0246,6.565,7.7732,2.56,0.6454,1.8667,0.7152,3.3899,0.9095,6.151,0.0022,12.4502,8.1303,1.7311,0.7369,1.5514,3.2861,3.5775,0.2463,5.2829,2.3819,4.1201,3.8033,9.6422,0.2627,5.6947,3.8373,0.1969,3.4876,1.3514,1.4388,1.7452,0.9757,1.6528,5.496,0.2961,6.8452,0.1309,0.0044,0.0032,1.9947,2.4407,1.799,4.0864,5.3043,1.6638,7.8283,0.0147,0.7933,5.4261,1.4985,0.389,2.6666,0.8233,0.6865,3.3379,2.9208,2.8827,3.6866,1.4367,0.5185]}
{"id":4643,"ended":true,"length":417,"text":"Desperation is the main character in the new series of books, he goes on a quest to find his twin brother who has gone missing while being a prisoner of an evil villain. The evil villain forces Desperation into submission and now Desperation has grown to the size of a giant crab with a mind of his own. Unfortunately, he is also crazy, and very hungry\u2026\u2026.\n\nThe Desperation series is by the UK based author of The Evil Dead trilogy, Frank Coughlan. Frank has been writing short stories for 25 years but the Desperation series has won critical acclaim and been made as a TV film to be broadcast on TV3. The books are a bit similar to The Evil Dead with their gruesome imagery and violence.\n\nDesperation is a great read, but the plot is hard to follow in places as the author tries to juggle the many strange characters in the story. However there is no doubt that Desperation is a great read, it had me constantly looking for the next chapter to find out what would happen next. The Desperation series is not for the faint hearted.\n\nDesperation is currently available in hardback and paperback from most bookstores and online. If you have missed out on this series so far, I would recommend that you hurry and pick up the hardback editions as I suspect this could be the only chance to read this very good series.\n\n2 Responses to \u201cThe Desperation series by Frank Coughlan\u201d\n\nHi again, I hope the email worked.

{"id":4711,"ended":true,"length":430,"text":"It has been more than 2000 years since the last human was seen. The newest generation of robots are beginning to grow skeptical of the `` Humans made us '' theory.\n\nThe future is here. The first ever robotic baby has been born -- and its artificial intelligence has shocked the community, while raising a few questions.\n\nResearchers out of the Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines (IRIM) in Japan have created the robot baby by using artificial intelligence to mimic the human body.\n\nThe robot, named Gendai, is programmed to make sounds and to react to human and animal vocalizations.\n\nIRIM research professor Kojiro Sasaki also said that the robot is programmed to respond with the same human expressions as infants and children.\n\nThe robot is controlled through an iPad tablet. The researchers claim that his future babies are a real possibility, considering that their model could easily be replicated.\n\nAccording to Sasaki, it is much harder to develop and control an intelligent software that acts like a baby. The baby is more closely associated with nature than computers are.\n\n\"So with this in mind, developing a robot infant that could act like a real baby would be extremely difficult,\" said Sasaki. \"If we want to develop a robot baby that could behave like a baby, then we will have to take more time and effort to get it right.\"\n\nFor now, Gendai appears to be limited to basic movements and interaction skills such as turning his head. He has yet to use words -- for now.\n\nDespite his limited abilities, however, the robot was able to respond to both animal and human sounds.\n\nThough the baby looked adorable in his pink blanket and soft bib, the robotic version made a surprising discovery while he was resting on his mother's lap.\n\nWhile the baby was sleeping, the scientists found that his eyes would twitch on his mother's face. When the baby saw the light, they twitched again.\n\nScientists are currently working on a more advanced version that has more capabilities and might even talk to adults. But even once technology develops to a more advanced level, it will likely take years for scientists to design a baby robot that looks completely human.\n\nMore information:\n\nThe robot baby is available in the video below.","token_len":470,"entropy":[4.2388,1.2528,4.967,0.2024,8.5888,0.1813,0.0726,1.0468,3.1963,4.5475,3.3294,4.2277,2.7062,2.3722,8.3792,4.2567,0.2538,3.9055,2.1769,4.4697,0.0645,5.8047,11.5601,0.8353,1.441,14.4404,14.5512,6.5916,3.4644,5.8356,2.9841,0.6568,2.2334,0.0036,2.1438,5.4221,1.8243,4.8012,0.8589,2.2816,4.0806,5.2445,3.2851,5.1319,3.2232,0.8563,0.7,5.4452,1.5726,3.5182,7.5217,1.3921,2.4951,8.3148,0.9311,5.7116,3.4363,6.1338,4.1572,2.9894,3.6463,1.7526,0.8405,0.9287,0.0003,6.6248,8.5685,0.8944,1.6841,4.0197,0.5038,3.5664,0.9888,4.5504,3.5898,1.6224,1.8295,2.022,0.9616,1.7092,3.6232,1.2959,2.667,2.4463,5.3247,5.7843,4.7207,2.5584,3.051,0.1862,0.8337,4.9093,1.3904,0.9236,2.7029,0.8095,1.0051,0.0002,1.2533,1.6468,2.6557,0.9483,5.195,6.4202,3.3149,0.5773,1.0236,3.7304,0.3554,3.9302,5.009,1.7689,4.081,4.4551,0.9256,3.712,5.2407,2.5776,7.9115,0.0529,0.5154,1.3712,0.0002,5.7003,0.0075,5.5219,3.8601,4.2605,4.5867,0.3355,4.7802,0.1857,6.0285,2.6963,1.3744,1.1877,1.2766,1.872,3.8919,0.1884,3.5354,3.2357,3.2423,2.3304,2.9728,5.8391,0.6451,8.1101,1.9661,2.2522,0.5669,0.2575,0.0003,1.7222,1.2125,1.7177,5.9751,3.3947,2.6173,5.8263,5.5786,1.8243,1.7469,4.889,4.4886,0.7701,8.2358,7.564,6.0217,2.0102,4.6289,4.4592,2.3144,2.1212,6.3907,0.9355,3.3785,8.1998,3.5898,4.5363,1.0279,4.3532,1.694,0.1799,0.0003,4.2292,0.0039,1.056,0.0007,0.0943,3.5234,1.0085,5.3021,2.9235,0.4544,3.2583,3.8371,4.0496,2.4066,2.628,6.8163,3.0354,6.2714,2.0034,0.7293,3.4317,1.0728,3.0118,4.2495,1.652,4.1522,4.7441,3.4334,0.0438,6.2572,1.6333,7.4176,3.0146,1.2909,0.2917,0.0002,2.1796,5.3464,5.5232,2.1213,4.6477,0.02,0.21,7.2147,1.2439,1.2295,7.2375,2.7136,3.503,2.93,0.4024,0.3795,2.9374,1.6947,2.0053,0.4567,2.7918,0.5101,0.6168,1.8197,0.1147,0.0003,0.1603,1.9547,3.7023,1.7178,3.3533,0.2686,2.5697,1.1121,0.9345,2.5799,1.0803,1.6204,3.9158,0.2513,0.3474,3.6217,0.4349,1.4733,0.9404,3.0699,1.2132,0.0129,4.3252,3.8343,1.6213,1.1598,1.3973,1.0079,3.2018,1.1127,2.2164,0.3965,0.2236,0.0003,4.329,1.3961,0.0803,4.125,0.0083,0.0002,5.1447,0.2769,0.2077,6.582,0.4165,4.7392,5.758,1.9485,6.9288,5.0845,3.7235,0.0027,5.9415,4.294,0.3722,2.0398,2.567,2.0774,3.104,0.0021,5.2436,6.6111,5.6488,4.9396,1.237,1.2911,0.3962,0.0002,5.2656,2.1377,3.4675,2.2617,0.1637,5.1883,0.0054,1.7264,0.9369,4.3652,1.5923,0.0029,5.1179,0.6204,5.2987,5.0578,0.2842,0.0508,2.7525,0.7527,0.607,0.0002,5.8922,1.5289,2.7434,5.8624,5.6149,2.7896,2.8962,5.8568,7.5009,2.5339,5.536,7.488,3.0567,1.0164,1.4272,3.5167,5.3349,4.9786,1.9806,4.4494,2.0272,5.4302,3.004,0.176,4.8962,1.6095,1.1926,4.0829,0.0515,0.9222,0.25,0.3479,0.0002,4.139,1.2688,1.1093,1.476,3.3956,0.2687,0.9781,4.4621,2.8179,0.8894,2.4324,3.4103,5.6278,3.844,5.4814,1.4479,2.5166,0.0377,2.7081,0.9461,3.9642,1.2203,1.2222,5.368,1.3685,4.0062,1.2315,3.9102,8.5436,0.0214,3.1206,0.6052,0.3683,0.0002,5.5097,2.3094,2.8122,1.5186,0.5826,1.7533,3.4106,1.8487,1.1959,2.8338,4.4114,2.7197,4.6986,2.3465,4.6283,1.2943,6.3951,0.8531,7.203,0.4907,3.8281,3.6622,7.2569,5.9137,4.1322,3.717,3.9254,3.4311,0.4613,0.5671,0.1314,1.6455,1.4332,3.5482,1.1385,2.7648,1.568,4.983,0.0768,5.0525,1.2963,3.939,0.4887,0.9331,4.8885,5.7252,0.8103,0.2581,0.3801,0.0003,4.9066,1.2697,0.9228,1.4799,0.0004,2.9556,3.1156,1.1862,1.9713,6.0676,2.917,1.8001,5.7713,0.6576,0.8473]}

{"id":1928,"ended":false,"length":436,"text":"Pranksters from various subreddits hack into President Obama's teleprompter during the State of the Union Address. This, being Obama's last year in office, just decides to go with it.\n\nThe pranksters are clearly having a field day with the president's teleprompter, trying to figure out the best gag while he's delivering an important speech. The one that gets the most laughs? A graphic showing a giant Obama foot.\n\nOne of the pranksters also managed to get a graphic for \"Peeing\" next to the teleprompter.\n\nIt's unclear when the video and photos of the incident were taken, but they were all posted to Reddit.\n\nSo who was behind the prank?\n\nThe Reddit user who uploaded the photos and video claims to have been involved as just another internet citizen making some jokes at his expense:\n\nYeah I was just another shmuck making jokes at the expense of ol' Barry. I don't know the person who actually pulled this prank. At this point I really don't care all that much. I've also given up on trying to figure out where this all started because there are so many different possibilities of possible perpetrators. I think it would be really interesting for reddit, and for history buffs, to know exactly which of us is responsible, but that's probably never going to happen. People always blame an anonymous person when they fail to do something.\n\nAnd there's a good reason those pranksters and the one who uploaded the videos will likely remain unidentified... because President Obama didn't seem to mind one bit.\n\nIt was all in good fun and he couldn't have been a nicer guy about the whole thing.\n\n\"Everybody has something to say, but these aren't just random people,\" Obama told the Huffington Post after the speech. \"We made a list of some of the crazier folks from all across America who came up with some really creative suggestions and ideas, and we were pleased with the response from the audience... And it was actually a testament to how excited everybody was that they were willing to step out and do something so crazy and get up in front of everybody. So it was all good.\"\n\nHere are some other reactions from the audience during the speech:\n\nWhat do you think the prank was?","token_len":472,"entropy":[7.4542,4.7357,5.1875,4.8791,6.3149,10.8302,1.462,9.1384,1.4857,0.0931,6.7649,2.152,0.2042,4.1958,2.4689,6.2089,0.0814,0.0261,0.003,2.4031,1.0489,4.0518,4.9229,7.1374,5.0193,0.2388,3.6975,4.2022,0.4443,0.1321,0.086,6.9501,11.5948,1.8946,3.5338,4.0173,2.7462,0.3376,0.8174,0.0014,2.4323,5.4567,0.3486,2.2622,5.1129,5.1751,0.9955,4.28,0.0018,1.6969,1.2921,2.7712,1.2756,2.8651,0.016,0.0218,1.7562,6.7967,0.0744,3.5117,0.0253,3.5948,2.9908,8.573,8.1514,1.8436,0.976,5.7661,3.3723,3.5227,0.3102,0.432,2.6942,5.4782,3.0767,2.6373,1.5215,0.1689,2.2053,3.9659,2.8426,7.415,3.0922,2.1488,5.5152,4.709,8.1606,2.8735,0.5699,0.0002,4.8793,0.9691,0.1804,1.9042,0.0281,3.9939,3.9056,0.0138,1.989,1.7373,5.9294,4.7449,4.2878,4.8412,4.9729,2.1619,3.245,8.6611,0.0527,1.0243,6.0084,0.0039,0.0025,1.222,1.4784,0.0002,3.7511,0.7543,2.4755,3.666,0.9789,3.6296,5.7823,5.271,2.5093,0.3562,4.4899,2.3497,1.1249,0.9484,0.3491,3.2307,3.0277,4.1263,1.6281,1.6947,1.8299,1.39,0.8704,0.0002,4.8532,4.0863,2.9132,1.071,0.7958,0.5792,1.6951,1.6493,0.0002,1.8257,3.788,1.2344,1.3065,2.5474,0.1225,4.3272,2.4634,1.2753,3.9096,1.2276,0.6264,1.5297,3.8293,4.9464,8.2916,2.3205,5.4033,8.2301,4.8767,4.9693,4.0242,3.686,2.7711,1.5091,4.8315,0.2189,0.0002,6.2644,3.8365,2.4117,1.9234,4.2313,9.3135,4.2621,0.7369,5.8319,2.5602,0.9805,2.1819,0.151,0.0083,9.5375,0.3248,7.7359,1.7617,2.3012,3.1959,0.0012,1.1137,4.1637,4.763,1.4204,3.9793,5.4024,2.2161,1.2681,1.262,6.1118,2.2068,0.1658,1.0185,4.93,0.6034,0.0007,2.5938,6.3686,0.1163,0.0078,1.2146,1.4901,3.5923,5.8568,5.7767,1.715,1.0904,2.8822,0.1028,2.4483,0.127,4.0566,1.4602,3.7119,1.3857,3.3231,3.8037,1.5362,0.9452,0.0828,3.1672,4.3918,4.2771,6.5992,4.1726,0.508,1.6816,3.1733,1.5014,3.243,0.3775,3.3131,2.7176,3.5503,4.8448,4.7916,2.4639,2.2478,8.2845,3.1077,1.3909,0.2917,2.7806,3.0803,3.8198,2.1186,3.8874,2.398,0.3336,3.4671,2.692,3.5754,0.796,4.2948,5.7216,0.614,0.0025,0.5767,0.281,5.9571,3.9458,6.543,6.2951,3.1565,1.5002,4.0246,1.119,4.3146,0.3856,2.905,1.0685,2.0195,1.496,0.0002,4.2599,3.8108,0.8295,1.9403,2.5468,2.1748,6.4849,3.214,0.0602,5.3687,2.3188,5.1192,1.1154,2.6857,0.3344,3.7259,5.4919,3.0689,4.8417,5.8545,6.2066,3.9892,6.7405,0.1016,4.4097,0.0005,5.2523,0.2975,2.8986,5.5213,0.175,0.6305,0.6315,0.0002,3.8365,3.5912,3.5911,3.7093,1.338,0.0198,2.8259,4.3468,5.3409,0.0007,1.3912,1.0357,3.9871,2.8837,1.4791,7.1615,4.4345,1.1712,0.312,0.267,0.9014,0.0003,4.73,7.0893,3.3317,4.3401,0.6959,1.2974,2.0752,1.5924,6.368,4.3509,0.0007,3.6637,4.5467,1.5993,2.5374,2.1786,1.7714,1.5485,4.3326,0.001,4.0748,0.7345,1.5106,0.2851,0.215,3.1956,5.8798,1.4507,3.8999,0.4003,3.5041,0.4926,0.3456,4.9542,3.8236,5.9139,4.5623,2.7501,3.185,2.8056,1.9966,4.4438,1.5815,0.2691,1.3847,2.3115,4.303,5.9437,2.5214,2.1301,2.5806,0.5458,1.5705,3.1631,6.372,1.1806,1.6037,1.6328,3.0485,1.362,2.1019,4.7328,4.15,2.6031,1.4141,4.9375,2.17,7.6579,0.0271,1.9405,5.1706,4.6379,0.2213,2.1883,2.6072,1.4696,4.4795,0.0052,4.6337,3.2636,1.6098,1.8591,0.2295,2.7163,3.3789,1.5714,7.9193,4.9013,1.9682,2.3897,0.0299,4.2816,2.2578,3.4375,2.3447,0.8375,4.2426,3.8407,2.3303,0.5197,0.0003,4.523,1.9357,0.8768,1.8211,5.0002,0.9104,0.7875,1.5352,3.3225,0.2862,0.5547,0.6283,0.4901,0.0002,5.2097,2.2709,0.1159,0.0951,3.9187,1.8996,5.4581,0.7011]}

They discover the ruins of lost civilizations and find a dragon. And after a grueling battle, they must decide whether to risk their lives to slay the beast and claim their freedom and that of their comrades\u2026or let him go free and face certain death.\n\nDragon\u2019s Legacy is an epic fantasy that mixes elements from Chinese and Korean mythology with themes of exploration, colonization, and survival. It\u2019s part action-adventure, part sci-fi, with RPG gameplay to boot.\n\nIt\u2019s a world in which an army is trying to control and exploit magic to fuel both warfare and its own power. A world in which a once powerful dragon has become a myth, with only a rumor of its existence. And in which a remnant of that ancient dragon race has fled underground and is looking for a way out without ever knowing how much worse their lives will be up above.\n\nBut as long as there are survivors still trapped\u2014whether they\u2019re human or dragon\u2014and the dragon still out there to be stopped, this tale has only just begun.\n\n\u201cMankind has been dealt many blows over millennia, and this one may just be the most devastating of them all. Those who survived a plague have no memory or sense of time\u2013a time that could be as little as a few hours old or a span of thousands of years.\n\nThe first survivor to return from the ravaged world above emerges into a future that is as alien as the old one he once inhabited. A dragon, once the scourge of humanity, is now an ancient relic of myth, but now a part of this world along with the other lost civilizations. He must choose whether to live as a slave in his own domain or set out to find out what happened to humankind, and whether anyone is left to fight for their freedom.\n\nThis is a tale of action and adventure, and the ultimate decisions faced by an army of men on a quest for power and survival.\u201d\n\u2014 Dragon\u2019s Legacy by Brian Anderson","token_len":473,"entropy":[10.2946,0.7047,5.2931,2.7909,7.6313,8.8743,1.6548,5.3717,6.5927,3.4553,3.2191,3.1962,1.0043,1.2586,0.0145,5.1626,5.451,1.4158,3.1983,8.1159,2.3595,2.0572,0.0658,3.4302,1.4303,1.7703,1.3578,2.1885,5.1287,0.0304,4.0481,3.8846,5.1695,0.0027,1.614,4.0593,1.6878,0.0192,8.4306,0.3162,2.7941,6.8089,2.6275,2.0146,1.6331,1.8661,1.7693,0.7456,0.8151,7.3324,8.2723,1.3899,4.6118,6.8399,7.8565,0.529,3.3618,4.5716,2.388,3.9531,0.1005,7.899,1.967,1.3798,2.7802,1.8453,6.2278,2.3938,4.5692,4.0211,1.7619,5.7562,0.0015,1.12,0.5439,1.6038,3.3302,3.4023,1.428,0.6147,5.5667,0.9045,0.1585,1.0748,6.8272,1.2716,2.9289,2.6533,5.9486,0.9461,2.3725,4.9512,6.8041,0.1209,0.654,4.3349,4.9386,1.7732,4.3911,6.3717,2.6184,4.2859,2.3996,4.3472,8.1763,0.1907,0.5854,0.4774,0.0003,5.308,13.5232,11.3774,3.45,7.3009,1.6345,2.0612,2.0681,0.9856,4.8143,5.5376,4.4229,1.5378,8.1881,2.6675,3.7145,0.9553,1.6567,7.0569,0.7135,5.167,0.5291,8.9095,0.2621,0.7734,2.6192,0.3138,2.1188,14.3469,1.391,0.0086,6.0705,6.2964,2.2022,0.3214,0.0002,1.0413,0.0701,2.9486,0.0107,0.0004,1.2615,4.173,5.3916,6.3545,4.8026,3.9072,0.2652,1.2317,0.0003,4.3851,2.2307,0.0096,0.0012,1.3361,4.7963,3.3469,1.2537,5.1789,2.4783,3.1179,5.2579,0.0472,4.9494,3.8042,6.4515,5.5812,2.9692,6.9417,7.3806,6.119,0.023,6.3659,2.5104,3.262,0.4923,3.2457,3.486,2.1793,0.0931,2.5105,7.6288,2.1227,5.0642,2.092,3.2752,1.0428,6.5181,2.6929,3.9401,4.1987,1.756,9.6067,1.1412,0.685,0.7952,2.0686,2.4953,3.0583,1.3336,1.8174,7.6497,0.2886,4.8549,2.621,2.6693,4.2637,1.7669,4.517,7.3513,2.1171,2.0967,5.1362,0.2228,1.4138,1.1664,0.6774,6.9379,3.5866,3.2671,3.7608,5.9142,7.0423,3.8984,4.0948,1.1772,0.4061,8.2027,10.9156,0.4977,0.3239,0.0002,5.2704,3.4297,4.0986,0.0074,3.1925,1.3531,2.9526,6.6381,3.3568,8.0388,4.2708,1.5794,5.5181,0.6292,3.2789,3.704,0.4132,0.9532,0.3046,2.7313,2.005,2.5898,5.0669,5.6495,0.1587,3.6743,3.169,6.2374,0.1959,2.89,4.7943,4.3375,5.1048,2.0254,0.0676,0.2397,0.7297,0.0002,4.0127,6.0547,7.1498,4.8954,2.3679,2.1291,6.2724,5.8804,2.3703,3.1999,7.1032,0.9918,1.2536,3.8593,3.4993,3.3492,2.9296,1.0445,0.2842,2.2766,2.9926,2.7137,0.3212,0.9939,0.1798,6.6767,0.5997,2.8141,4.1158,2.4782,3.5018,4.3713,4.9777,4.177,3.5257,0.0426,4.4665,8.2515,3.527,4.5282,1.6485,2.8118,2.0764,3.3399,4.2085,0.1416,1.0968,0.9948,2.1568,4.2487,2.9027,2.4826,9.0242,0.2102,3.5588,0.1066,0.1001,0.352,2.997,0.0002,2.6561,5.0149,4.0233,1.6184,4.5203,2.4354,0.5239,5.7077,1.1566,9.9385,7.0741,5.5087,1.3541,6.7558,1.9674,1.4107,2.7153,4.7149,1.4831,1.469,5.6452,1.7552,4.7321,3.8445,3.2209,0.3886,2.7729,4.2416,2.1572,4.8687,2.5604,5.8986,0.16,2.7577,0.3133,1.4478,1.4786,3.468,4.5188,4.0578,1.6658,5.6196,1.6529,4.0295,3.3815,2.6393,5.359,0.0451,4.7477,1.5224,8.2828,0.0574,1.6044,3.6091,4.9134,1.0374,0.8666,4.3957,2.0965,2.2797,2.7007,0.3218,3.0003,3.3636,0.6515,6.1024,4.0447,2.5446,1.9084,5.5806,0.7866,7.2754,1.2774,1.0149,2.8653,4.1704,1.2325,3.2422,0.3196,5.7656,3.0152,1.8057,2.0352,7.6859,3.0927,3.6734,1.2148,3.9104,1.4698,2.2102,1.3684,0.6142,0.2344,0.0001,3.1853,1.2516,0.8052,3.1167,0.6591,5.9468,1.6239,0.8027,0.8781,1.7713,2.5391,4.8598,10.1311,6.7786,0.1978,2.989,2.4395,0.6537,5.1444,4.6614,1.0569,1.7298,1.8196,4.6322,1.4529,1.6287,0.2484,6.5938,5.2658,0.578,11.5163,5.3528,1.0581,0.0157,0.0088,0.1976,5.0539,4.983,6.2849]}

{"id":1166,"ended":true,"length":429,"text":"Some years ago, the concept began of reverse revenge : elaborate, drawn-out plots to reward someone for a good deed.\n\nThe most famous reverse-revenge operation, Operation Gratitude -- an effort to thank a US soldier who, while serving in Iraq, was photographed carrying a wounded Iraqi child from the burning ruins of his father's house -- was featured in a documentary called The Good Samaritan.\n\nFrom the 1940s to the 1960s, there was the Operation White Feather. It involved the mailing of homemade cards to US soldiers deployed in Germany during World War II. On them were written messages from kids thanking soldiers for their efforts to keep American soldiers safe.\n\nThe reverse-revengeful concept has since grown to include not only people but cars, dogs, cats, and various other items.\n\nThe most successful reverse-revenge effort came in May of 2009.\n\n\"It is a rare and precious moment in history that has happened twice,\" said John Breen, who organized the effort. \"Just as we were doing it with the rescue missions, we were using that time to try to promote some positive attention for the war.\"\n\nThe idea took hold as a Facebook group and spawned a movement that included blogs, YouTube videos, and even T-shirts. People from all over the country were encouraged to leave thank you notes, stuffed animals, food, flowers, and even homemade items in care packages to deployed US troops who needed a boost.\n\nBut many of the packages fell into wrong hands.\n\nA few months after that effort, a US Marine who was serving in Iraq said the man who delivered a dozen flowers to his camp actually worked for the police.\n\n\"We don't know if they sent them to him intentionally, if they just lost track of the box, or what. But what we do know is that some Marines were hurt, and the flowers that they weren\u2019t expecting could have been used to try to comfort a soldier that just lost somebody else in his barracks,\u201d says Breen.\n\nStill, Operation Gratitude continues to honor those trying to serve overseas. And it seems many members of the military took the message to heart. According to the Department of Defense, Operation Gratitude sent out almost 12 million packages of appreciation to troops.","token_len":474,"entropy":[6.8326,0.8193,0.482,2.4901,7.0169,6.4903,7.8774,9.853,11.7897,8.218,12.1166,2.7818,7.3323,0.9589,0.0807,3.7845,2.293,6.8771,4.9909,1.0913,2.777,4.5164,0.2378,1.2195,2.6999,0.019,2.5212,4.4788,1.2564,7.9612,3.4982,1.9728,0.0348,7.8786,2.7092,5.5129,6.8307,2.6868,0.9349,9.031,3.9159,3.3914,0.3859,7.7704,1.2082,6.4301,2.5539,1.6905,4.3117,3.711,2.9362,0.7699,1.3568,0.1959,1.8307,6.8945,5.649,0.5697,4.9261,2.7288,4.2496,4.9449,1.3655,7.08,4.8638,0.0709,2.8449,3.7083,0.0493,1.7141,1.4947,1.2287,6.8278,0.7589,1.3406,2.9046,2.778,2.6448,5.6333,1.4158,0.0062,0.9622,0.8261,0.0004,6.1239,1.2976,5.7087,0.0221,1.074,0.3905,2.4789,0.0001,0.1048,4.1893,0.926,3.6952,3.3545,6.876,7.8177,2.9412,2.8203,1.6191,2.1904,10.7983,0.2571,7.7492,5.6099,1.0375,3.4006,1.4462,7.9459,1.1915,4.1678,3.4019,0.3492,0.0019,0.0963,0.8004,5.3978,6.2966,1.2527,2.5865,3.2205,2.3906,9.8257,6.5877,4.2403,0.6764,0.7358,3.8159,1.7125,4.3652,3.9967,1.2434,1.0506,0.6614,0.4047,0.0003,1.8515,6.6642,1.3366,0.1243,0.0287,12.6707,5.1213,2.8669,2.4548,4.1591,1.5934,0.759,6.642,0.5529,5.4277,5.2828,6.0675,0.9173,6.0487,0.4696,4.1725,0.5361,1.7052,6.8059,1.1273,3.1364,1.2671,0.6978,0.0003,2.3006,4.2531,3.669,2.5659,0.2772,0.0427,0.0184,4.353,3.7645,0.4562,6.2329,2.4812,3.4585,2.1744,1.5929,0.0002,2.9184,2.4322,2.8756,2.0481,6.2632,3.0395,5.7077,2.9472,1.1359,1.543,2.6818,4.5259,3.0443,7.8955,1.7016,0.9749,4.5425,4.6184,4.9767,0.1626,2.9437,4.8766,0.289,3.3416,0.755,0.5578,5.9864,2.059,2.5606,2.8902,3.2028,0.9905,3.9693,1.0415,7.3593,4.421,1.2698,1.2676,1.6286,4.8549,3.9307,2.6935,0.3328,4.473,0.6104,5.8484,4.47,3.4254,6.6703,2.3687,1.0176,4.305,3.1218,0.1381,0.0002,1.5927,4.1405,5.0816,2.4815,3.822,1.9227,6.1034,1.5574,4.5913,7.4371,0.9892,4.8756,2.729,4.1816,7.4361,0.711,4.1698,0.4682,0.2511,0.5307,2.0518,7.2647,0.2104,0.0289,0.7314,5.652,3.0038,1.4451,0.3518,0.115,2.1744,3.2878,3.7617,0.0649,6.4152,10.4987,0.4955,0.2257,2.0599,11.283,2.7303,0.1623,5.3125,0.3737,3.7838,0.1352,0.5408,1.473,6.2654,4.4104,2.6099,10.547,2.7402,2.6604,13.6384,2.4353,0.9612,2.8458,3.4091,4.6638,4.7635,0.4172,0.1789,0.0002,3.4563,4.0199,1.7288,0.5284,5.8349,5.2739,1.8224,6.5899,0.0281,0.497,1.061,0.0001,3.3924,3.6032,3.2912,0.985,4.1531,5.1807,0.5985,1.6079,3.7018,2.2421,2.8312,1.7985,3.6541,0.5288,0.9859,4.2964,2.4661,6.152,2.5993,3.9903,3.429,7.4085,4.933,0.8349,2.2199,8.3838,7.2022,6.4352,1.1343,0.8602,7.0226,1.0522,0.8144,0.0002,0.8433,3.1245,4.1739,0.0009,1.1467,1.9577,2.6428,5.3431,3.133,1.2242,2.0665,6.7891,1.2028,5.4201,0.8209,2.5414,5.252,2.3835,0.1765,2.1993,5.008,1.1748,1.0358,3.946,3.2331,1.7256,4.4313,0.6291,0.7956,0.0101,0.1397,0.4231,4.6945,7.354,2.2217,6.2173,1.9821,0.8855,3.2691,5.0565,3.4601,1.6117,7.3198,15.8652,8.6067,1.1212,3.8741,5.5102,0.516,0.6842,3.2715,0.8719,4.5129,0.3711,6.7426,2.8218,3.2387,3.4478,4.9741,2.2238,7.2131,1.8082,2.9792,2.8597,7.1279,2.9668,8.9069,9.1301,6.9933,1.5668,0.0009,0.149,0.2357,0.0002,5.2431,0.21,7.5318,0.4906,0.0014,0.0033,4.5469,1.1173,8.1785,1.6254,7.8277,0.0361,5.5021,4.8809,0.6368,4.1864,1.7413,3.812,5.2357,5.0326,0.2777,0.3838,1.607,6.6407,1.5924,4.3291,2.2821,0.1038,0.3924,7.157,0.0008,1.9209,4.3629,0.0016,0.2452,0.4693,4.5245,0.2094,0.0007,0.0065,5.1375,2.6502,5.2666,4.8394,1.5162,3.7815,2.0815,8.1043,3.0921,3.7624,2.7728]}

If you want to add \u2018realistic\u2019 details but also want them to be smaller, maybe use a photo of the dino, that\u2019s in landscape and resized by the photo editor.\n\nYou can also start by creating the background and adding the info in a normal-sized image, then scale it by using the transform tool of the same editor to make the image smaller \u2013 it will create the illusion of more details.\n\nI hope you\u2019ll start this fun project with me!\n\nHere\u2019s a video I\u2019ve created, and the best thing about it is that I got to practice quite a bit of my new Adobe Illustrator skills as well as playing with my 3D printer.\n\nIf you like it, you\u2019ll be able to use it in your own classroom as a cool demonstration of an important (if long-gone ) element of history.","token_len":478,"entropy":[3.3738,2.8577,9.1207,2.5506,4.3993,6.4439,3.6719,2.4578,2.3566,11.4814,0.2557,0.9518,0.1856,10.3935,2.1117,6.8017,2.5643,9.1358,4.9132,2.6143,13.0103,15.2924,1.6394,5.4999,6.0363,2.0327,5.519,3.5266,6.5771,4.6078,3.4727,0.3498,2.1221,0.0078,4.2186,5.4129,6.0594,3.2317,1.1671,2.7202,1.2419,2.2356,2.1685,1.8493,16.641,7.4664,1.4858,4.0614,4.9589,3.5102,0.7375,7.2928,1.671,0.6241,4.563,0.9229,5.062,0.057,0.1433,3.6017,0.7493,1.1827,1.8364,2.3403,1.2321,5.5533,4.1973,3.577,7.6281,5.4963,2.5233,1.1714,10.4518,4.6277,6.7157,3.2469,0.0737,6.9666,4.0893,4.5557,4.777,3.8847,7.1995,4.316,2.585,3.3465,0.5278,3.1649,1.1221,1.7375,4.2738,2.8602,7.2897,1.8412,5.2707,0.8545,6.1787,0.3418,5.3687,5.0929,0.0548,0.2025,3.8463,5.2556,2.1206,3.837,0.8495,9.1337,3.3539,3.5564,5.4782,0.3283,5.071,1.4509,1.8886,4.9969,9.5406,6.5703,9.8651,1.6221,1.3617,1.6548,1.0436,0.0003,4.7243,3.944,0.2419,3.6637,0.1767,9.4927,0.8805,1.7912,5.4312,2.7477,7.0721,0.6436,4.5505,0.5769,1.9688,5.4357,1.732,0.163,0.2252,1.6768,1.7677,0.0131,6.1807,1.1487,3.619,2.5941,1.0459,5.843,0.4164,0.0393,5.4248,1.6406,4.476,5.7017,5.7256,0.7361,1.0884,2.5532,3.6366,5.2215,6.9847,0.5924,3.3743,4.6538,2.0673,4.3037,1.7084,0.3604,5.6272,1.4029,1.7266,0.9959,0.0002,4.6083,2.7301,1.1897,1.8874,2.1405,6.6549,4.7333,5.4443,3.1493,6.4122,3.4671,5.6814,4.895,2.8262,2.8694,0.0499,0.0193,8.143,2.1787,0.1673,2.102,2.7002,4.3022,2.8505,0.5757,1.9009,0.6118,4.0331,1.4345,8.7779,3.5849,3.2227,5.8199,1.9699,5.3121,5.6593,4.9666,1.1397,1.3028,0.7761,1.5653,0.0002,3.2518,4.5108,2.9837,2.156,4.3844,0.0385,9.1124,4.0508,2.9555,2.4995,0.5096,0.1606,0.0115,1.7864,0.2336,3.3236,5.1268,2.3395,4.207,1.5358,1.491,5.803,0.5017,3.9984,2.8266,3.4714,2.7747,1.3116,3.2971,5.0426,0.4657,5.1551,0.4897,0.0484,0.0456,1.2301,0.6853,3.1532,2.5161,5.4515,3.4249,3.0137,6.5895,2.5452,2.6613,7.1529,2.6673,1.7278,2.5327,1.8726,1.0749,0.0378,0.0118,3.727,4.7749,2.5347,0.0446,0.0138,0.0054,4.8338,2.3805,5.5099,0.6336,1.2923,2.8871,4.1368,1.9676,1.5097,0.5143,3.5448,0.4015,2.4444,0.4787,2.6732,10.8438,0.7951,7.1904,0.558,0.7388,0.2976,1.3428,6.743,4.1746,4.7032,4.2572,0.5438,1.5584,7.6856,0.7029,5.5508,2.7722,1.2103,5.6754,1.9922,1.5876,4.1622,0.0509,2.6312,4.093,4.2295,0.0205,0.1008,6.1516,7.3798,3.7283,9.4027,1.8697,5.3119,2.3087,5.8676,4.4517,0.5886,0.5651,0.0002,2.9315,0.9926,1.3406,4.8847,2.3489,2.0237,3.5241,5.3316,2.9892,3.7841,2.4374,6.6088,2.8941,2.2186,6.7224,3.7563,1.4955,3.3126,1.3807,3.5361,7.3609,0.9581,2.3302,3.0619,1.3089,8.0517,2.9283,5.0706,0.8752,3.4898,8.1048,3.7881,2.293,1.8827,2.9607,2.5861,4.571,3.0791,2.4691,4.6339,1.8318,3.8164,0.5368,4.1069,2.5944,0.8199,0.5524,0.0002,2.9026,3.0455,0.7722,3.1761,0.0386,2.5361,4.9213,4.3433,7.3989,0.4036,1.2564,3.5414,2.8017,0.9255,0.0003,5.1417,3.5801,0.1066,0.5695,1.2371,2.4482,3.5814,6.3855,0.11,1.5709,2.4429,2.9045,3.775,3.5191,4.5965,3.6486,1.1732,0.0937,1.1299,0.753,2.3172,4.6161,1.1413,7.0306,5.5821,0.1446,0.4186,3.2364,3.4367,4.6611,9.7485,1.4847,0.0027,1.6518,4.2045,0.5769,1.7732,5.9883,0.7762,3.141,4.7591,0.1378,2.3556,0.7667,0.8324,0.0003,2.6676,0.082,2.2621,1.9454,0.3447,1.8948,1.8217,0.0556,0.383,2.2933,2.2053,0.0045,3.6496,0.6362,1.7243,0.5946,1.2536,9.9236,3.1709,3.8593,6.1273,4.9368,1.3382,5.8925,3.5515,6.6759,3.0062,6.4977,1.0655,5.806,7.9961,5.1158,0.5786,5.3466,0.9102]}
{"id":2483,"ended":true,"length":452,"text":"The Pit Stop: Pavement Ends, Turnouts On The Road\nThe Pavement Ends\nTurnouts are a huge part of our history while a small fraction of us have gotten out of our comfort zone and turned out. But now, they can be an important part of your life \u2013 if not for the sake of community, for your own safety. They can save lives and make driving a less hazardous and stressful experience for everyone and help you focus on what you need to do when you turn up. Turnouts give you an opportunity to get on the road safely.\nTurnouts are very important for a lot of reasons. With turnouts, people can be on the road at the proper turnouts to make their turns with minimal stops. Additionally, turnouts can have a more positive impact on people's mental state. Turnouts that slow traffic are beneficial because it makes turnouts safer and easier to use. They eliminate dangerous driving situations and can also slow down the amount of time you spend behind or in front of a vehicle, increasing your awareness of your surroundings.\nWhen considering the importance of turnout areas, one should consider that you are reducing the amount of time you spend in your vehicle which can make driving safer. Turnouts are more effective because it allows you to make the proper turn with limited stops. Turnouts and slowing traffic can benefit motorists of all ages. Children can use the turnouts and turn onto the road to get to the crosswalk. Also, seniors and anyone with a disability who needs the help of the turnouts can use these. Turnouts can also help the disabled and elderly because they allow you to safely get on the road without any of the risks and injuries of driving with obstacles to your left and right.\nThere are many reasons for the importance of turnouts like the ones that we discussed. We must all do what we can to keep communities safe and to improve accessibility for the people that need help. We need to do all that we can to get on the road safely in the shortest amount of time as possible.\nWe are at the end of the pavement, but the road goes on. Turnouts are so important in making it easier and safer for us all to get on the road. Turnouts can help with your mental and physical well-being and can make you feel a lot more relaxed when you're using them and getting on the road.","token_len":480,"entropy":[10.8298,4.8371,3.6208,5.902,4.8877,7.6713,2.7144,5.9927,6.2749,7.1526,2.8388,1.8409,1.4842,6.526,3.7459,0.1896,1.993,3.8065,3.4289,1.1744,3.5453,2.3208,4.4979,0.8033,0.0065,3.0544,4.4334,8.5453,5.0845,4.1831,3.9648,0.2351,2.9328,2.3541,5.2943,2.6346,0.5073,2.0533,3.4045,0.6397,1.8579,4.0767,3.7757,3.8798,3.9319,4.7546,1.4429,5.0937,3.705,1.0278,3.5775,1.854,0.3226,0.0236,3.5094,1.8384,4.4832,3.3883,2.5635,3.6935,1.0954,8.7984,0.0028,6.6013,1.5078,3.0053,1.7149,3.1707,0.9406,1.6177,4.7483,1.7269,4.5238,1.2074,1.6055,2.9248,6.9342,2.6045,3.9549,5.0505,2.1434,4.3476,1.5771,1.2556,1.4236,5.3054,4.0795,1.28,5.1117,0.4251,2.2482,1.4149,3.4557,0.2969,0.3049,3.9033,0.4913,3.7962,6.0454,2.5158,5.4224,0.7937,5.5412,0.5941,2.7108,0.6012,0.04,3.3197,4.3911,0.9661,0.2182,3.8093,2.3978,1.0667,1.5853,0.5717,0.9931,4.8394,0.8285,1.8314,3.4397,1.1127,0.0174,0.7136,0.7842,5.782,2.2775,0.0698,0.6388,3.3729,2.8675,2.5109,3.841,0.3577,0.3193,2.0134,2.5408,7.001,6.6323,4.4943,3.4631,2.6247,2.5613,3.9132,5.6629,3.2418,7.3972,0.9456,6.5893,0.0101,2.1082,0.0373,1.3196,3.7485,1.1301,4.7044,1.7734,0.6224,0.1561,3.2128,0.565,3.2055,4.7174,1.377,1.877,0.0661,5.6015,5.0537,2.5916,2.8615,5.5893,2.8581,2.0799,2.8934,7.0176,0.1243,2.8546,1.3,3.0645,0.8892,3.8762,0.4466,4.4515,6.4756,5.705,3.4603,2.4987,1.3403,3.6962,2.4477,5.3468,0.5022,1.6564,3.9305,0.0383,0.4767,1.6772,1.9109,4.3682,6.9652,2.092,0.819,0.0081,1.2562,1.185,3.306,4.3876,1.1992,4.5979,0.3818,1.8471,0.4606,1.1859,0.7666,3.9791,6.6457,2.4686,3.2316,0.0303,9.8572,9.1161,0.5918,3.6223,4.1098,1.3914,3.094,4.0031,2.1728,6.4356,0.815,1.9234,0.0246,0.8357,0.6362,0.6018,1.6162,3.3695,2.0354,6.2622,1.3745,2.7078,2.8576,1.6058,0.9699,1.0924,0.2145,2.0438,3.9265,2.9229,2.3777,2.598,2.4695,0.5268,0.1009,3.2025,2.7033,5.1702,1.4372,4.6368,5.7322,2.0024,1.1785,1.459,0.0946,5.6903,7.0768,2.2034,1.3703,6.5348,6.054,4.6741,0.1336,0.4173,1.8335,8.2262,2.5064,3.4768,1.5763,1.837,0.4947,3.0333,3.9292,7.8527,1.0928,1.1601,2.6261,1.7007,0.9734,3.2197,7.3833,0.1695,1.4071,6.047,0.1421,8.4531,2.0108,4.8483,1.3407,1.801,0.8009,4.0327,2.9281,4.0252,2.8003,0.4419,1.779,2.2685,0.4238,0.5948,0.72,5.2497,4.1371,2.4322,0.2023,0.9782,0.9574,1.1508,4.4436,4.8906,1.7443,3.1514,4.781,0.8216,3.2772,1.0484,0.1119,4.7835,3.4525,2.1977,0.1385,0.0835,1.9691,2.7841,4.1107,0.1198,4.2611,2.1374,4.5806,2.9868,2.9002,3.5968,7.4713,4.517,1.8,5.1275,1.6062,0.1427,0.169,0.5439,4.7161,0.2089,1.1665,2.7344,1.9974,3.1637,3.3897,0.0164,1.1335,0.024,7.0904,2.6304,4.8432,3.6779,2.7924,1.0748,3.1739,4.4105,5.5557,2.9802,4.0437,3.0407,0.2751,0.209,0.0968,3.2199,5.3591,0.3408,1.4492,2.7564,4.0795,6.7706,1.4758,2.6646,2.2278,3.6236,3.1818,2.2298,0.7967,2.4917,1.6418,0.2421,3.1856,2.7268,2.9051,0.1714,0.0059,0.1485,3.4078,5.0756,0.1025,0.1191,1.4595,4.5449,1.5379,3.9707,1.6087,0.0126,0.0068,3.6993,1.05,0.3558,1.6206,3.3879,2.5566,4.9626,1.4321,2.7336,0.012,1.7313,8.6521,2.7601,2.5096,2.7982,1.8851,5.4653,1.3653,1.1149,3.7458,0.3304,1.0167,5.0106,0.1826,3.7623,3.7103,3.5285,2.0263,2.795,0.7924,0.5266,3.2081,0.9176,0.7179,1.3618,0.634,0.1387,0.0519,0.5389,3.2336,0.1798,1.6935,1.5903,3.879,3.5696,2.599,2.1877,0.2424,2.7685,0.6732,0.0,1.523,2.6539,2.7744,1.9207,1.3425,4.157,1.7467,0.8362,2.513,2.4513,0.4934,2.574,5.6511,4.3976,3.9231,4.1769,1.7803,0.064,0.0573,0.3783]}
{"id":3893,"ended":true,"length":420,"text":"It's Always Sunny Meets The Purge' In New Trailer For 'The Purge: Election Year' (VIDEO)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nIt may have been billed as a horror film, but Blumhouse's \"The Purge: Election Year\" did not feature any true scares. We had the killer clown and a creepy little girl, but beyond that, everything that was thrown at us ended up being very predictable.\n\nWith that being said, it was easy to look past \"Election Year's\" bad quality, because it had plenty of good ideas. If the film had had the guts to commit to its themes, as its predecessors did to its gimmicks, then we could have ended up with a genuinely terrifying political thriller.\n\nInstead, \"Election Year\" opted to be a simple and cliche horror flick, and that is why it failed to have any lasting impact.\n\nUniversal PicturesHome Media Group has given \"The Purge\" fanatics something to look forward to, or at least that what they want us to think. They released a new trailer for the upcoming reboot, and it looks absolutely insane.\n\nA trailer is not going to tell us much about a film, but it certainly has us intrigued as hell. Let's take a look at \"Election Year's\" trailer below and see why we want to see this twisted horror flick...\n\nSet for release on DVD and Blu-ray on March 10, the film was written and directed by James DeMonaco, and the plot finds the U.S. president presiding over a night of murder and mayhem throughout the U.S. While you won't find any of the gruesome killings made popular in the \"Purge\" series taking place, DeMonaco's film looks to have plenty of other things up its sleeve.\n\nThe synopsis reads like this...\n\nSet in a nightmarish near future where poverty and crime have risen to catastrophic levels, the film follows four disenfranchised people who use a special \"Purge Night\" to enact vengeance on those they believe have wronged them.\n\nStarring Ethan Hawke, Elisabeth Shue and James DeMonaco, \"Election Year\" looks to be a very interesting flick, and we at Cinema Blend certainly can't wait to see what the filmmaker has up his sleeve.","token_len":480,"entropy":[3.0338,10.2021,1.5316,11.2212,2.2066,0.9066,12.8239,0.8676,5.1277,6.1604,5.0805,3.5311,3.1832,1.2793,2.6057,2.8441,0.0048,4.5047,7.3209,2.6736,0.6384,3.4822,2.1538,0.056,0.2537,0.0005,6.7981,3.9001,1.9555,0.0003,6.9779,7.9602,2.3393,0.4621,7.781,0.0484,0.8891,5.3122,1.6995,0.6834,0.1918,8.3854,1.5711,0.0157,2.3608,4.4781,1.668,0.0738,0.0014,0.8443,0.0265,0.0313,0.0344,5.4882,1.2718,3.6573,2.2061,6.8086,3.7889,1.0792,4.9144,4.3994,2.7225,8.9951,3.7583,3.8192,2.9548,4.352,4.4878,2.7063,2.6041,1.2385,9.4005,0.3096,0.7609,4.7276,4.0795,2.1091,5.9004,0.3937,0.9732,5.9905,0.082,1.7382,4.7452,5.6645,0.4182,1.0814,0.0002,5.3548,2.193,2.1451,0.0329,0.0235,2.5172,1.8647,5.02,0.2053,5.3873,3.1937,2.6305,5.8901,0.0623,0.4321,5.7809,0.4419,5.0418,5.5142,2.3815,2.9418,1.4163,3.0961,4.2124,0.0671,3.2144,5.2387,1.054,4.9999,3.3921,2.3045,1.5663,3.3372,2.5422,4.6997,0.4126,7.9576,0.3972,4.0192,3.2546,0.992,5.676,4.3508,4.1617,0.7008,6.9073,2.0484,9.2749,0.2688,0.1465,3.4602,2.2122,1.8344,0.5791,5.4041,0.118,0.4821,1.0555,5.4617,3.4725,6.6048,0.3594,0.7062,0.7419,0.0002,3.9486,0.1116,1.5809,0.7248,0.0006,0.0749,0.1461,5.474,1.5402,3.0619,1.183,5.4513,3.7423,7.159,1.2895,2.6277,2.3318,1.6236,2.5793,2.9419,2.9923,2.8047,1.1194,4.0878,0.8794,4.3125,1.6948,5.3197,0.6446,0.748,1.2957,0.0001,8.1467,1.3478,15.4371,4.8943,3.9969,2.7912,4.949,2.0705,1.2935,0.0394,0.0011,0.7679,9.8982,3.473,4.7296,0.3769,3.5559,0.0074,0.0038,2.108,6.6412,0.5277,0.0788,4.241,7.356,0.7436,2.6422,4.716,0.018,1.8303,1.4573,3.5583,5.2155,0.9455,2.1631,0.2878,0.8696,0.4357,3.3557,4.4532,1.7581,1.6162,1.627,2.1894,4.1557,4.6927,0.4399,0.5876,0.0001,4.807,3.0495,3.6533,2.9234,4.3429,0.0098,4.285,2.1422,2.7432,0.9621,3.67,1.7344,1.5471,0.7773,1.1688,3.1188,3.4137,5.2004,3.1172,4.7658,3.7054,0.2759,4.6177,0.2539,1.6413,0.0457,0.1843,0.3548,4.5304,0.5298,0.0015,0.0454,2.4205,0.136,0.8674,1.8393,3.7667,0.7995,2.9139,1.7153,4.2233,0.7113,0.9348,2.9506,8.344,3.0144,1.0773,7.567,0.3504,0.0002,7.303,4.8431,0.5331,0.6247,5.5891,1.4974,0.1185,0.0079,0.084,1.6184,2.6415,3.6543,0.5442,3.1455,1.271,4.0997,3.1716,1.4182,0.118,0.0034,4.3979,5.0036,7.3951,0.1925,1.1773,1.5789,3.1138,4.8469,8.7051,1.7748,5.5453,0.1498,0.0835,0.0639,2.7656,6.9295,0.0292,0.6537,7.5235,1.6076,5.9893,1.2682,1.0234,5.5059,0.8402,3.0771,0.0006,0.021,0.2994,5.4449,4.8802,4.2796,0.0002,1.4212,1.9347,2.6705,0.5671,5.0205,5.4002,5.7769,4.5856,1.4083,0.8797,4.8861,4.3088,0.0046,0.3115,3.5371,8.5594,0.0197,2.0894,3.4428,0.0019,0.0059,1.3601,3.8866,5.0397,2.1847,2.7391,5.2658,0.1193,4.8876,3.0604,4.8886,0.2856,0.2597,0.631,0.355,0.0001,2.1014,6.5272,1.4516,2.8589,0.72,1.741,0.1254,0.0001,7.0746,0.4364,1.2275,7.2761,1.613,0.0092,7.9546,1.407,1.6461,8.1594,0.9008,2.323,2.6157,4.3456,1.6585,5.0748,1.1982,0.3002,1.67,6.5242,1.8417,4.3755,7.6128,0.0024,3.1307,1.2984,5.9385,2.1695,5.1528,4.3485,4.1709,0.0154,7.8409,0.9781,0.9806,5.9406,4.9577,1.1694,2.4202,1.4153,2.9389,0.811,4.2245,0.0056,0.0659,0.2381,1.1409,0.0001,7.7405,0.0269,6.5143,0.1905,0.0004,0.5421,6.5374,0.6872,0.0092,3.533,0.0187,2.1946,5.0359,1.2452,0.0333,0.0072,0.5647,0.8034,0.2853,0.0011,0.0387,0.1587,4.6961,0.5072,0.7869,0.9728,4.2954,4.4521,5.3331,1.2569,1.1871,2.6556,6.3611,3.7998,1.5544,6.0958,3.4642,0.0242,0.1698,0.2,0.1946,0.9354,1.9142,4.8285,0.8715,3.0398,0.0605,0.2825,0.4219]}

{"id":1457,"ended":true,"length":472,"text":"A god bets to another god that he can kill a random man no matter how much the other tries to save him. After several near-death situations, the man meets both of them in the center of the room. The first god kills him, the second one comes to save the man, but he is unable to do anything. This is the beginning of the story.\n\nIn \"A good man goes to war\", a man named Robert Jordan begins running with a group of men from a settlement who escaped from the brutal people in the countryside. Along the way, one man is killed because the group of Robert was afraid of being attacked. On the way, Robert and one other man had an argument, but Robert tells the other soldiers that the argument won because the group is going to war to save those he left behind. Before the war has begun, the man who argued with Robert gets killed by a bear and Robert feels guilty for killing him.\n\nIn \"The Gunslinger\", Roland is in a caravan headed to a gunslinger school. While traveling, Roland accidentally kills a boy. His father tells him that the boy was bad, and Roland has to live up to his name. Then one night, Roland finds himself in a bar with a wild man. Roland tells the man where to find a black gun that he thinks will help him win more battles ( the gunslinger's only weapon is the black gun ). On the way to find the black gun, the group gets lost. On the way, Roland finds a black gun that makes him feel alive, which causes him to become addicted to it. At the end of the story, Roland finds a black gun by the gunslinger school. The gunslinger tries to kill the black gun, thinking that it made him too weak.\n\nThere are also different morals associated with the two stories. The first is that the good man is important to the world. In \"The Gunslinger\", the gunslinger tries to kill the black gun, thinking that the black gun is bad. The second is that people are allowed to do things in life. In \"A good man goes to war\", Robert tries to stop the war because he couldn't save the soldier he killed during the argument. The moral of the story for kids is that people in the world can do good and bad things, but they should try to do the right thing.","token_len":482,"entropy":[10.3491,14.5948,5.2249,5.2521,0.7839,2.5201,1.2983,2.2773,4.2628,2.309,5.4781,3.4183,7.5598,0.029,1.0498,2.3642,4.3332,2.4044,6.4153,0.6856,4.2097,0.2867,0.5216,5.4649,5.5798,8.5499,1.6736,0.932,4.8594,0.6761,1.6728,3.9954,7.4969,7.007,1.9111,0.7079,2.0223,1.1654,4.7805,0.0871,0.4041,1.4633,0.9052,1.9728,3.7354,3.0022,5.323,1.3167,1.2022,1.4865,0.2769,1.9773,5.9564,1.8111,1.4581,1.8426,1.1437,1.6988,2.2404,2.6888,2.335,3.43,0.0048,2.4536,2.3065,1.4766,4.1627,1.5646,1.358,4.4543,0.0352,0.5161,3.3013,1.4553,0.816,0.0023,2.605,3.4744,3.7812,6.4992,2.0693,5.0017,1.1956,1.7752,1.1478,2.9527,2.3542,2.3855,5.9562,6.9592,5.5242,6.3116,4.5748,1.498,2.8307,0.0216,2.5725,3.0573,1.4264,6.7244,3.2914,7.5522,1.0993,1.5136,8.0663,7.7196,2.6221,0.8752,5.636,0.5753,6.2151,0.6656,0.0243,0.3859,4.0725,2.888,2.5304,1.3354,5.8397,2.9468,3.1276,2.4354,11.2,5.2798,5.1283,0.8021,3.404,1.7205,1.3542,5.0044,0.6246,1.0612,0.8398,2.2754,3.2941,3.8315,2.1724,0.3218,6.3032,3.3838,0.6459,1.8661,1.8619,2.2949,4.4897,1.6397,1.1164,9.5491,0.9424,2.5274,6.71,5.4412,5.9783,1.7507,2.5669,3.2459,4.4455,0.1512,4.4969,4.4665,1.4821,5.4094,4.0842,6.1434,0.0929,0.1909,5.9953,1.4104,2.2536,3.7948,2.2223,0.0459,1.1877,2.6642,2.2999,8.523,0.3967,1.9183,3.4034,1.8922,1.0586,1.6736,4.9977,2.4394,3.1785,6.8139,2.7866,1.1095,1.4913,1.2764,0.3717,1.561,0.0002,0.962,0.4319,1.8833,6.7676,0.6581,0.5942,6.8265,2.7331,3.1919,1.1205,6.3927,5.6224,1.3562,2.0287,9.0182,0.1976,4.9687,1.4937,4.1461,3.3629,0.9492,1.7709,4.3961,2.2425,0.7147,3.4766,2.7456,4.6725,2.2496,2.9123,0.4235,0.5982,1.868,0.6099,1.6083,7.019,1.1552,1.0344,2.6513,4.2382,1.0402,6.0089,4.752,0.0154,0.6106,3.7689,0.5501,5.3461,4.5428,2.6511,0.2541,1.2789,3.6491,2.0885,1.0306,0.566,3.7327,1.8784,0.8299,7.7744,2.1088,1.5212,2.1555,3.4256,0.618,1.0148,5.41,1.568,0.8121,2.3819,5.7549,6.704,2.8135,1.372,4.3204,1.9474,2.7182,0.4035,4.9409,5.7293,2.1555,5.6769,10.2471,4.3868,0.0299,3.5217,5.7669,2.7406,1.2456,2.313,3.5419,1.4078,1.9656,5.57,0.5116,0.4535,1.5669,2.9595,0.5317,1.0018,0.0663,0.0496,1.7284,6.1354,4.0857,2.3919,2.2598,4.9205,0.4192,0.0655,1.1342,1.0379,2.9257,1.1941,3.0549,2.4586,1.8615,5.3742,0.8305,2.2513,5.8134,1.801,3.4424,3.1267,0.6221,0.0297,3.1615,5.0985,0.1052,1.9866,0.318,4.2397,0.8641,1.343,0.1125,0.2529,1.6263,0.0684,0.7682,3.2899,1.2614,0.9634,0.1569,5.9144,1.3624,9.1708,0.0174,3.5189,1.2396,2.505,4.2214,0.0061,4.9082,0.0754,1.3939,1.9189,2.2532,0.5729,0.7304,7.7775,0.8258,1.1717,5.8819,0.3859,4.5358,2.4442,1.9301,2.8,0.0002,5.6351,0.7827,2.2448,5.8366,10.2748,5.078,0.0417,1.5808,3.531,4.5588,0.7069,1.5998,1.9616,1.455,0.8533,1.5349,5.9327,0.5065,1.5203,7.2611,1.2889,0.6958,3.5859,1.9232,3.5638,1.3617,0.9536,0.2995,0.0007,0.2409,1.0968,5.8159,0.0028,3.5056,0.033,1.0792,0.8982,3.7615,0.4819,1.3802,3.0205,0.1923,2.1417,1.3948,0.1044,1.0541,3.9821,0.6944,1.4323,0.7383,0.4069,0.0486,5.0219,1.9879,5.4721,0.0272,3.6543,2.3413,3.3252,4.0043,2.3201,1.1853,0.2638,2.6115,0.776,0.0377,0.6154,0.0244,0.0017,0.1091,4.1974,5.5484,0.0384,3.3325,1.0214,1.6367,4.1181,0.6704,6.2442,0.0007,2.7321,1.3338,6.0535,2.8301,2.7615,5.1546,0.4147,7.4403,0.5085,2.162,6.4337,0.9346,0.6133,0.8101,5.8073,9.7099,0.4087,0.5558,3.2531,5.2907,1.5107,0.935,2.733,1.7622,2.6457,2.4801,1.8428,0.1768,1.4928,1.2941,1.7203,2.2488,4.5066,0.5376,1.2735,2.3656,1.0992,0.3117,0.8647]}
{"id":2626,"ended":false,"length":424,"text":"Quentin Tarantino is given complete creative control to retell a classic Disney story... as long as he plays the villain.\n\nThe filmmaker's take on Peter Pan, written with his usual cheeky flair, has been described by Disney-owned Pixar boss John Lasseter \"as an epic love song to childhood... the kind of film I might have made as a kid.\"\n\nTarantino, though, will play Captain Hook, with Leonardo DiCaprio playing the title boy.\n\nThe director, 49, admitted he only started work on the project after the studio bought the rights to use the character but had long been fascinated by the tale of the boy who stayed home to care for his mother.\n\n\"One of the reasons I was attracted to the project was a sort of morbid interest in the idea of childhood innocence slipping away,\" he said.\n\n\"The Peter Pan story has both a melancholy side and a rousing side, and I find that very exciting.\"\n\nBut with Disney's blessing, the script has had some changes of its own.\n\nTarantino says it is darker, with pirates as opposed to pirates and the Tinker Bell character is a major baddie.\n\n\"Tinker Bell becomes Captain Hook's love interest,\" he said. \"Peter Pan is the villain. Tinker Bell is one of the main players in the film.\"\n\nThe project has already secured its writer-director and is now looking for a star - which could be the film's real problem.\n\nDisney boss Bob Iger admitted the star might be tricky to find.\n\n\"At the moment we aren't thinking in terms of any actors who are out there, but it's something we might have to look at,\" he added.\n\nTarantino's involvement could put a further cloud over the planned 'Pirates of the Caribbean' spin-off, with Orlando Bloom reportedly keen to reprise his role as Will Turner but the director himself having nothing to do with it.\n\nMeanwhile, Disney said its movie slate would now be released over a period of two years instead of one to better fit with the studio's new TV strategy.\n\nComments unmoderated.

So what do a group of misfit inter-stellar adventurers do? They go on a wild ride through an adventure in time and space.\n\nYou've seen your father killed by a giant worm. Now the only thing standing between you and total destruction is a mysterious alien race who may help, or may not.\n\nThis game is the tale of the first inter-galactic expedition to Proxima Centauri.

{"id":3315,"ended":true,"length":425,"text":"A love potion goes horribly wrong...\n\nCupid's Arrow\n\nby Sarah Jane Morris\n\nCupid, the world\u2019s favorite cupid, has fallen off his wing-like steed, and an arrow of love accidentally shot him into the heart of a rival named Cupid\u2019s Arrow. Now he\u2019ll have to help himself back to his beloved and make a very important decision-fall in love with and help Cupid\u2019s Arrow fall in love with her as well.\n\nBut things aren\u2019t always as black and white as Cupid has painted them to be. His old friend Apollo just might have an agenda of his own\u2026and a certain love potion that\u2019s just waiting to set things ablaze.\n\nCupid\u2019s Arrow is the first in Sarah Jane Morris's series of Cupid's arrow books. It is followed by Cupid\u2019s Sting and Cupid\u2019s Trick.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by this short story, Cupid's Arrow. It wasn't long but the story was quite entertaining and filled with a lot of passion. The short, snappish dialogue worked well with the action. I also liked how the author portrayed how Cupid feels about the arrow. Like many things in life there's a gray area between absolute love and hatred and it was evident throughout the short story.\n\nCupid's Arrow was a sweet read that will make your heart swoon (like Cupid's arrow) and give you something to think about. Sarah Jane Morris has a bright and beautiful future ahead of her.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nSarah Jane Morris made many friends with the first book, Cupid's Arrow. After reading the first one, Sarah Jane Morris has become well known in her area and has been invited to various places to speak to groups of high school students. Sarah Jane Morris plans to continue telling stories about Cupid's arrows.\n\nSarah Jane Morris grew up in Kent. In her spare time, Sarah Jane Morris enjoys hanging out with friends, watching her favorite movies, and reading any good book she can get her hands on. She's very much into reading and writing.

Located on the ground floor of an office block surrounded by high-end designer boutiques, the shop serves as the ideal oasis for the Georgetown community to grab lunch and enjoy themselves between errands.\nThe store's name is inspired by the philosophy behind the brand \u2013 offering an alternative look to the traditional \"casual\" shoes.\n\"Modern Magic is a name that describes our brand identity \u2013 there are so many modern men and fashion brands who offer very formal and traditional designs. Our goal is to offer men a more elegant and versatile look. Most men wear a typical pair of chinos, a leather jacket and sneakers \u2013 or chinos and loafers. We will do something different and use our skills and experience in design to create something fun and unique,\" explained Marketing Coordinator, Janneen McLean.\nWith a mission of providing men with stylish, and affordable shoes that are well-made and can work in any wardrobe, Yashida Shoes offers shoes for men aged 20 to 40. \"We really take great pride in our shoes, because we know every buyer is making a purchase for the next five to 10 years. It's a commitment,\" said McLean of the brand.\nIn addition to shoes for men of all shapes, sizes, and personalities, Modern Magic at Odeon Georgetown also carries handbags and accessories. \"We are the first company to bring footwear and accessories together in the same venue and offer a full line of handbags and accessories such as jewelry and scarves. We are so sure it will appeal to the target market.\"\nAn avid shopper herself, McLean explained that the Yashida Footwear brand has been around for 15 years and is widely recognized by high-end retailers in New York, Dubai, Singapore and Miami. Modern Magic is its first Georgetown location and will serve as the brand's \"flagship retail store.\" It will have regular sales events, as well as free seminars and workshops.\nThe business is also in talks with other retailers to open stores in Kingston, Monrovia, Portmore and other parts of the capital at various locations, and a plan to eventually open a store in Barbados is expected to be completed after this year.","token_len":487,"entropy":[8.7544,4.9311,7.8106,8.5334,2.1191,1.7505,0.6773,6.8313,3.9037,11.1196,0.4311,3.7286,2.5092,3.902,8.8776,3.7704,2.6205,9.6508,8.8327,2.8945,5.839,6.1186,6.3467,6.7478,0.6851,1.5188,3.6708,1.725,2.3088,7.0272,5.2769,0.4311,3.3141,9.8357,6.5458,6.0484,0.1154,4.9704,1.2689,9.0293,3.4451,4.6626,1.7505,1.1511,4.954,0.0194,0.1128,3.3705,3.582,4.2822,6.8103,0.0133,4.8475,0.6558,1.1465,3.9333,1.1878,0.001,0.3725,1.1755,3.5068,4.0095,1.1992,1.7516,4.4253,7.0841,0.001,0.4515,2.45,11.3259,1.9298,2.3432,5.1532,4.1362,1.5002,3.2675,6.3597,7.2754,8.6769,0.0072,0.5394,1.1606,2.2836,2.0025,2.0489,4.0792,1.6877,2.6232,0.0681,0.8038,7.9715,3.6945,1.466,3.0771,5.4938,5.689,3.3222,2.9725,5.1792,0.7018,1.1825,2.8096,4.413,5.5128,0.1047,0.3507,5.6066,1.6586,1.7362,1.3359,5.235,0.9261,1.1162,1.4142,6.4388,0.6516,5.4908,3.0665,2.7316,4.1861,4.0041,5.7652,1.2582,2.4556,0.0097,5.9824,6.0567,1.4079,6.1832,1.4831,3.481,5.0238,5.0218,6.5983,1.5002,3.8421,4.1791,1.8348,3.3175,2.6275,0.3113,0.142,2.4914,4.2685,2.1953,2.7165,3.8568,1.1643,5.6319,1.5236,2.7312,6.1125,1.6389,4.2623,2.3358,5.3609,2.6798,0.0853,6.3217,0.1892,1.2849,3.2366,5.4544,1.4694,2.0443,4.4558,3.5931,4.8354,6.9427,0.0635,2.3424,5.2015,0.0006,1.6214,1.8216,4.7573,4.7412,4.6746,1.1601,2.848,5.2355,2.3382,6.996,1.7649,1.3347,2.032,4.2509,0.6061,1.3364,1.891,6.262,0.7465,2.1522,1.4113,2.4349,7.6101,4.4482,2.7642,6.602,4.2343,7.165,5.904,3.3178,0.2214,0.1866,4.517,1.8179,4.978,1.5799,2.051,2.3859,0.5014,4.5448,1.751,6.3283,2.7908,2.3792,1.9692,1.6016,4.8417,1.4343,2.9169,1.0485,5.4207,5.8818,2.2167,1.9526,5.5728,0.3136,1.6813,0.001,0.0037,1.1088,2.5117,5.3741,2.9257,1.8819,5.8532,3.2061,1.4556,3.3225,1.2201,4.6557,1.4294,6.076,5.4051,3.4503,0.5947,0.0213,0.8033,1.4259,1.7002,3.5997,1.0954,3.1562,5.5714,9.2371,1.8953,6.3929,1.5595,2.0535,2.7605,1.9308,5.0365,4.5994,2.7565,0.7254,0.0709,1.1033,3.2404,0.6378,1.8063,6.1259,5.976,1.1113,1.8792,0.0001,5.3208,0.6772,2.6473,1.1356,0.3134,3.7694,0.8339,0.0796,3.4287,1.8751,0.3181,4.3366,0.2152,3.5919,2.0863,0.3905,0.92,0.4617,6.3571,0.0901,7.2509,0.0058,7.8286,0.4685,0.0011,0.0005,13.9484,2.568,3.8957,5.8164,2.2125,1.6135,3.055,1.79,1.9509,1.3677,2.157,3.5898,1.9602,4.0234,0.9006,4.2139,6.8617,2.9893,0.6266,5.9175,1.8666,2.8622,2.8813,7.1623,2.574,3.1599,1.7511,3.9969,1.8891,0.1298,2.1518,0.0851,0.8953,0.4365,6.5362,0.0032,4.888,1.8193,4.6019,0.0026,1.3719,1.1391,1.806,4.0012,6.7799,4.3785,0.9125,3.7547,0.0476,2.3368,6.9135,2.0239,5.1816,0.253,6.1466,4.6089,1.7683,0.0158,5.3529,0.1532,0.4182,0.0002,5.6344,0.8598,1.9161,5.2099,0.0035,0.0061,5.9228,0.0885,2.0165,1.9708,1.599,2.522,0.3383,4.2834,0.093,0.8887,2.2072,5.7561,1.2589,2.4843,6.8672,0.5007,0.4998,1.5846,3.6048,5.1088,0.1268,0.8115,6.2484,0.2541,3.7797,1.2856,6.2178,0.2655,8.0096,0.0113,1.7251,7.8909,1.3285,10.7257,1.0096,0.9567,2.5781,4.0851,0.6422,1.272,4.6285,0.1533,4.1989,7.478,0.0136,2.5213,2.605,1.769,4.9343,1.0652,3.9777,6.0099,3.9498,5.893,1.8847,3.5176,0.0244,0.0222,6.1227,5.4121,1.0747,2.2143,1.3233,0.5203,2.4621,5.1484,1.772,3.3698,4.4013,4.2374,0.6167,2.711,1.7617,1.6601,2.4455,3.1988,0.691,8.8551,0.5073,7.8975,0.8456,0.443,0.3588,5.2419,11.4469,1.5568,2.3839,2.2167,0.0062,0.4644,5.725,6.6152,3.9855,2.6992,2.4143,2.8174,4.3772,4.6648,1.3852,5.5739,0.6585,1.0504,1.7815,0.3311,8.1009,0.0279,4.2128,3.1149,0.8073,0.3346,2.5665,5.6204,3.5639,0.8337,0.1924]}

It is a delight to watch the romance grow.\" --Amazon reader of the book","token_len":487,"entropy":[5.2847,7.1769,4.1466,4.1102,1.8729,6.4597,3.075,5.8973,1.6464,5.5487,5.9062,6.4002,3.3777,0.2727,3.637,10.2757,0.5961,7.1385,16.0056,2.075,1.05,0.0797,3.2976,5.3102,5.6813,1.2659,0.6285,0.9538,4.4077,5.1058,2.7909,2.8107,5.4821,6.0042,7.3058,0.8121,2.6769,1.6247,0.0002,3.144,3.5157,6.5013,6.6526,2.8292,1.1938,4.9096,0.893,6.7883,0.0399,7.8829,0.0023,1.5046,4.7803,2.0808,0.5458,5.1299,1.7625,5.2255,3.6275,5.6549,0.853,2.1249,6.086,5.5575,0.9588,2.161,5.6825,6.2866,0.0321,1.5797,2.162,7.5343,1.9474,2.5292,0.7677,0.2687,3.9365,1.1593,2.0419,1.5527,0.1746,2.4438,2.1752,5.8263,0.0486,4.1799,1.093,5.9239,2.5258,1.5609,2.5446,3.2367,0.3845,5.8587,2.8206,2.734,5.5501,3.3977,7.4036,9.1253,0.5656,1.7931,5.3213,2.0423,1.4737,4.3812,0.0121,1.6495,8.6289,0.4837,2.4164,5.6595,0.4194,0.9373,2.7716,1.3404,5.4549,0.5834,5.5308,4.9439,7.0377,0.2703,2.1634,1.2367,3.4848,2.653,0.7563,4.7376,8.0087,6.2261,1.6092,6.763,6.5697,1.8752,0.9906,0.0103,5.1914,3.6016,6.0918,1.5906,0.4295,3.1572,4.6778,1.0424,3.3581,2.2897,1.5036,5.309,1.7309,4.7942,6.1904,1.828,6.3942,0.3339,2.295,4.1843,1.7707,8.5671,1.2322,3.2375,1.0983,5.7691,0.0082,0.8729,4.4179,3.8885,0.4382,0.5228,3.574,2.0677,2.3425,0.2819,4.9386,6.0647,5.6026,1.5897,3.4683,0.691,3.0802,1.2869,4.2263,0.2829,2.3815,0.6234,0.7381,0.7114,0.9374,1.5508,3.2318,2.0449,3.0563,1.7937,1.2349,0.435,5.6175,1.2375,6.0329,0.9985,4.5981,2.2151,1.6733,2.1603,2.8742,3.5062,0.9891,9.6797,0.9777,6.9392,0.9154,5.2174,0.3512,0.3805,4.1532,3.0631,0.2038,4.9449,3.6194,1.0731,0.2757,5.9135,4.2166,0.9118,2.1312,4.1445,1.0876,3.8936,8.0814,1.3524,1.5835,0.0882,1.4838,5.6245,1.9435,1.3527,0.693,1.2588,0.1935,2.5499,1.0854,3.5552,7.8079,1.8869,0.0002,3.3505,7.9904,2.0095,4.9833,8.584,1.9611,0.2347,0.1307,1.655,0.0002,6.7777,6.0516,2.2918,3.9372,5.6043,1.726,0.0002,1.9084,3.2663,1.6995,1.6826,4.011,1.2236,2.2584,4.8518,0.0169,5.3897,1.1636,4.2727,0.4838,1.2777,5.3765,1.018,2.0229,6.1884,0.0298,1.5043,4.1118,6.5301,1.0824,4.9253,1.287,1.8453,0.4358,2.281,1.6134,0.412,2.4862,3.5238,6.9604,1.5608,2.3335,2.6514,1.2085,2.7949,7.3457,8.0326,5.0093,1.8073,4.3958,1.1418,0.0002,0.5038,5.7355,5.2155,7.9111,5.3038,5.0145,4.102,0.3692,3.7091,2.69,0.9452,3.197,3.1232,3.3966,1.6515,4.4437,2.7495,0.2784,0.0492,0.7308,5.4011,2.3533,2.7218,2.8249,1.0235,2.389,7.2894,5.985,0.9854,1.2395,3.5255,3.077,3.7276,0.4466,4.2177,1.3657,2.6457,2.6774,2.4444,2.65,0.0523,2.2451,1.0001,0.0386,0.1709,0.2551,0.2457,0.0001,0.4912,3.145,0.7397,1.0165,2.367,6.1511,3.2171,0.7153,0.9792,1.0914,8.0909,1.0214,6.2226,0.0129,0.3397,0.4017,1.376,1.7123,4.0607,2.6805,2.0397,0.3066,2.34,0.8695,0.9359,4.1873,3.0967,0.5947,0.5199,3.533,4.9718,0.6949,3.1131,1.5743,4.7208,0.6128,2.248,0.5436,0.0445,0.8437,0.3435,0.0113,0.03,0.0358,0.2376,0.0001,0.5182,2.3743,2.7416,5.5113,0.8704,3.4807,3.6455,3.3425,2.4922,0.2802,1.4326,1.2741,0.5548,1.3791,2.5988,0.251,0.2097,1.584,2.036,5.648,9.7187,4.0938,4.1669,1.451,8.2011,3.764,0.3068,0.3798,3.5772,1.3381,1.2626,3.3099,5.3375,1.468,3.9578,4.2572,1.1557,2.5335,2.8175,2.8462,2.7788,0.8508,1.4452,7.1071,0.3862,5.0328,0.1527,1.3033,1.1557,4.1757,1.6086,0.6667,5.0973,2.5137,4.7209,2.0104,4.5109,2.1401,4.0844,3.0786,5.7646,3.6022,1.2837,3.5775,5.7266,3.8648,7.154,0.0008,0.5954,4.7159,0.9342,2.26,1.0785,0.9528,3.9206,0.2278,4.2792,1.8513,2.6144,3.4816,2.7832,0.0369,0.3934,0.1409,0.005,0.0047,0.0103]}
{"id":1847,"ended":false,"length":477,"text":"It turns out that `` Big brother '' is actually owned by your big brother, Facebook, according to a new report by The Wall Street Journal (WSJ). The company has reportedly started mining information from its user's activity on the social network, including information from their personal friends through \"tag suggestions.\"\" Tags allow users to highlight people in a photo so that they appear nearby on the page; for example, if you're uploading a picture of your dog, a tag suggestion could be, \"If you like this, you might also like \" My Boyfriend's Awesome Car!''\" said Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nBut The Wall Street Journal found that Facebook is actually building its profile on your friends by tracking what photos you tag people in and what you say about them. The newspaper further found that Facebook was developing \"a new feature, which is in the early stages of testing and could be in Facebook service as early as spring, that would let users see every photo everyone has uploaded of them to the social network with a little button marked 'See More Photos of Me.'\"The program would let Facebook build a \"social index\" of the photos, as well as what users say about the people in them, allowing Facebook to \"rank\" people in their network.\n\nAccording to the WSJ report, the program is being developed at Facebook's New York office out of a small team of approximately seven engineers known as the \"Mallory Lab.\" This team includes several Facebook insiders, including David C. Kirkpatrick, former privacy officer at the company who served in the role for four years until 2005.\" Facebook is a private company that is responsible for the decisions they make. As long as they are not violating any of our rights, we have no reason to worry about the government taking over Facebook. If Facebook is running a program that is useful and is being used by advertisers, I say let them do whatever they want,'' said Peter Romer-Friedman, director of technology issues at the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n\"The people that use Facebook are probably not the most socially aware people who may care most about where their data goes,\" he said. \"As long as they are not hurting anyone, let them be. There's not much that we can do. This program is already happening.\" The Journal has reached out to Facebook, but the company has not yet made a statement.\n\nImage via Wikipedia","token_len":488,"entropy":[8.7345,0.0402,0.6958,12.9644,13.1998,7.9545,3.5835,1.0432,2.8537,8.5431,0.0642,6.8449,5.8455,0.647,1.617,9.8649,2.1165,4.4974,0.0015,1.46,1.6616,1.7379,1.4245,2.2496,1.6011,0.0004,0.0004,3.9984,3.4135,0.0005,0.5104,1.6801,3.1185,2.6954,4.8954,5.4391,6.6903,4.7318,1.1997,2.2324,3.4826,2.7277,6.9335,1.2363,1.3519,0.9674,0.4664,1.992,3.6551,4.3834,3.2824,2.3555,3.7637,6.2128,7.3008,4.1927,6.1804,5.63,6.4172,8.8459,5.6513,0.9812,0.0478,5.5993,5.5981,2.6199,1.2685,3.2064,6.3441,1.0723,0.9769,3.9142,6.2191,3.9338,1.5894,2.6673,5.9848,4.4291,0.4772,0.0606,2.3537,1.1696,1.7294,8.632,0.5404,1.3715,0.2087,2.1012,1.9159,1.2049,3.1428,1.0675,3.2102,3.2955,1.4848,6.0669,0.4549,4.8297,0.8941,2.8677,3.689,2.9641,1.8829,2.4813,3.7383,0.0605,5.9274,6.2434,7.5626,1.1323,2.4617,7.559,6.6082,5.9388,8.8405,3.4229,9.7315,3.2578,4.0649,0.0701,0.0016,0.9073,2.5158,0.0008,3.6876,6.3213,0.8198,0.0091,0.0005,3.5111,0.298,1.3983,2.6339,2.7166,5.4875,2.493,7.4629,2.4787,4.6176,2.93,2.9497,4.5442,3.4292,5.8859,1.0318,5.3409,5.1007,4.1205,2.8368,2.5137,2.0616,3.0593,2.0514,0.3768,0.7846,2.1725,6.2367,7.0791,1.1846,0.147,0.9714,4.3702,5.5098,3.0136,2.8664,2.2438,2.1601,3.4221,2.1443,2.643,5.9802,1.4106,2.8343,0.2126,1.0856,2.2952,3.1739,3.5794,1.5741,4.2129,8.7838,9.436,4.2045,0.5126,0.004,7.1027,2.8801,1.3999,2.1592,1.9634,0.813,2.8819,6.4814,2.1755,8.7635,1.8292,3.2608,3.9013,1.7424,3.2524,1.3026,1.4511,0.1704,4.7361,1.5108,3.8779,7.3923,8.2026,0.9701,5.6766,2.5969,4.7848,5.1884,2.9312,1.5681,4.0381,5.8591,2.225,2.0588,1.6437,4.7987,1.0658,2.3929,3.7057,6.4262,0.7824,1.3351,2.7093,2.6662,3.2054,4.4347,0.5355,0.0306,4.1788,3.9576,1.9934,0.3045,2.6966,2.1785,2.0022,2.0847,1.3503,5.2271,1.9641,0.1402,3.5695,5.9302,0.926,3.1063,3.4875,3.1121,5.8954,1.7619,1.8804,0.0002,3.3685,0.0033,0.8276,0.7932,0.0013,2.1697,0.1148,1.9221,2.749,1.7308,2.0893,1.3211,2.6009,0.513,0.6367,4.7718,0.2936,2.482,8.015,0.0133,1.6582,5.2137,1.2672,0.4899,6.7135,5.1032,3.1414,5.8933,0.2455,1.4496,1.0203,5.6684,7.209,1.6193,4.36,0.6628,4.3407,1.9029,2.275,4.6918,2.7128,6.3316,1.0377,0.8047,5.3031,5.4271,1.6669,8.8688,1.3177,0.1177,3.9903,8.4753,3.3581,1.1586,1.6853,3.9857,2.2934,4.1969,3.9204,0.6334,6.6981,3.2842,3.6824,0.0894,4.5674,5.1604,6.3163,3.6739,1.7437,3.2782,4.3663,0.1689,2.1154,2.2485,5.7805,0.0398,2.2172,6.8762,4.306,0.041,3.4335,3.8646,4.6795,0.0092,1.3992,1.6382,2.3284,3.7845,1.2946,1.7456,1.6736,4.2179,0.6522,1.0902,2.9261,0.8762,2.2594,0.0806,3.8956,0.6403,3.5939,6.8772,3.2234,1.9232,4.36,2.956,3.9186,3.5687,1.3346,5.137,1.0863,3.2191,0.9001,1.5505,7.4935,3.0782,4.2306,2.5812,0.4746,1.0581,6.6813,0.9035,2.9775,6.6838,3.7631,1.1064,1.6272,3.9482,0.1666,0.1632,5.8091,0.8885,5.4369,7.4788,1.2328,5.3697,3.5071,2.5574,0.5027,0.0384,3.9453,0.0416,4.6401,6.2347,0.3402,1.0448,3.7192,0.1239,0.0001,0.0005,1.0476,0.9445,0.0002,2.9601,2.095,4.8526,2.6456,4.0935,0.3008,0.873,4.7696,1.7701,2.4179,1.5051,6.0989,2.6692,0.9479,4.5405,5.0092,4.9644,5.9199,0.0618,6.1424,2.0479,2.8184,2.4265,1.9837,1.9644,1.1918,0.1854,0.7631,4.8258,1.6627,0.005,1.007,0.7701,1.7324,5.7596,1.3676,0.8245,6.5752,0.5796,3.1787,2.1599,3.8911,1.4156,3.9562,1.0747,2.4832,2.5898,0.2944,0.1037,3.7293,4.0201,3.3621,0.8913,4.5596,5.4213,2.7538,4.4621,4.3488,3.763,1.5873,0.0046,0.0404,0.388,3.2575,1.0701,3.5286,0.1243,1.2874,0.4158,1.6828,5.3857,0.8219,1.6193,0.4401,1.1433,0.0002,4.6125,1.3833,5.0787]}
{"id":3381,"ended":true,"length":472,"text":"( WP ) Tell me fantasies you have day dreamed before.\n( P ) The hottest one is I'm a virgin, so I've never had a girl touch me. I'm 19, a junior in college. It's summer, so me and my roommates are out at a lake on Sunday. We were at the lake for 3 days total, got bored on the 3rd day, so we decide to rent this cabin. It's my favorite place, I could never afford it on my own. That's where I decided to put on my bathing suit and go swimming. I was sitting on the ledge of the hot tub and my friends were in the water. I remember just looking up, watching the water falling from the sky, it felt like heaven. As I was sitting there, I started to have a fantasy, I was in Heaven, the water fell and felt so refreshing against my skin. I watched it fall and all of a sudden I felt I was being touched, I could feel the warmth of the water on my skin. A few of the guys that were there said that the cabin was for sex, but I didn't care. I took off everything and I was swimming, I was just in heaven. I remember laying down in the water, just looking around, it felt so good, almost like a miracle. I could feel the cold rain hitting me and the waves crashing on me, almost like being in heaven. I could feel the warm water on me, it was like I was born free, I was naked and no one was caring or judging.\n\nYour wish is our command. Post a new story, and we will consider your wish.\n\nI also noticed most of your stories are fantasies. I don\u2019t know if it counts as a \u201cfantasy \u201c. When I was 12, I had this fantasy of \u201ccannon balls\u201d. It\u2019s a pretty strange thing, but I know what my wife is into so, it\u2019s not that crazy. So, one night as I was playing with my little brother, he was trying to hit cannon balls. I pretended to dive and then he would actually shoot me and I would land on my back. I guess I was trying to imitate the Olympics or something at the time, needless to say, it was not long before I got an ass full of cannon balls.","token_len":488,"entropy":[12.9358,5.0822,12.1155,2.8422,15.9077,2.8749,1.6108,11.2674,10.9822,6.3569,2.7321,1.8712,9.3675,5.3015,1.3161,4.7155,8.1119,4.3312,3.6887,5.4811,2.4718,2.7738,2.7751,2.4069,3.0404,1.4262,3.6538,2.5925,1.7786,1.2763,3.7116,4.893,0.3188,1.0109,2.6318,1.9441,5.8072,1.8534,4.7332,7.2601,2.4127,1.0447,1.1718,4.1679,0.5586,6.1701,1.5521,1.2576,7.5681,0.224,0.5122,4.2795,0.0029,1.0426,3.4735,2.7223,1.5894,4.4353,3.9907,5.4389,1.35,1.9,4.4939,3.6132,1.2056,1.2256,2.5478,4.7519,2.112,9.3587,1.174,7.5194,5.4097,5.2848,1.2696,5.2062,0.1511,0.8752,0.9316,4.56,0.7288,5.9631,0.1854,7.5766,4.4506,5.2664,1.1856,2.4059,0.4544,4.4104,2.5658,1.0535,2.1432,2.2142,5.114,2.558,2.389,1.3872,5.1417,1.102,0.1338,0.7718,5.6558,1.0148,3.5097,1.0136,4.632,0.2146,4.21,3.6555,1.0005,6.4211,0.1439,1.3775,2.485,2.6982,0.5226,1.2551,2.076,5.2964,1.3232,0.5926,5.4239,1.0143,0.3114,6.9607,1.6685,2.0448,2.38,4.005,1.5433,3.6611,0.3528,2.6358,1.5486,1.0879,5.2303,5.3748,2.6818,1.9123,2.6186,4.5106,1.3809,1.867,7.3937,2.9893,0.2035,1.7158,1.4445,4.131,3.4549,1.2876,4.0702,0.6715,4.861,0.8779,1.4022,3.5604,0.948,0.9193,0.9447,3.637,0.8206,5.0639,1.8251,6.4281,2.6213,1.2948,1.6525,2.7402,8.0442,1.1594,3.6333,2.4684,5.056,2.4769,6.4334,2.2633,6.4316,7.6746,0.0883,0.4445,0.4365,0.7321,5.402,2.4439,4.3916,1.7044,5.7305,1.4874,0.2044,0.0008,0.928,2.2276,5.263,0.7091,4.0662,2.9316,2.0378,1.2827,3.0739,0.5279,1.9129,2.9451,0.6732,0.8567,0.3103,3.1012,0.0857,0.4584,0.8464,5.3413,3.0564,3.8662,1.5641,2.5223,3.6529,0.8948,1.8678,3.8805,2.3364,3.1279,8.0394,0.9091,5.9656,3.9078,1.0549,1.912,1.0036,2.117,0.0005,3.7854,1.115,0.6663,5.0948,1.3084,6.3679,1.0873,2.517,1.7038,4.706,2.4665,1.5114,1.3418,3.4648,3.195,1.8317,0.735,1.0155,3.502,7.109,2.0204,2.1875,0.447,1.1004,1.1166,4.2543,3.3684,3.8672,0.9487,3.4,0.9311,0.7934,1.4497,1.3919,6.5674,0.7838,2.1392,3.9515,0.7392,0.8264,4.1501,0.4981,1.1153,4.0916,5.2065,4.0683,1.2405,2.2374,2.318,4.2914,3.4758,2.0177,0.8639,1.0929,5.8388,0.3322,4.9722,1.6582,0.4707,0.379,0.7517,3.7099,0.3107,1.0033,3.0293,1.3999,1.882,3.6801,0.8913,1.965,1.1996,1.8113,2.3425,0.2531,7.6577,5.1815,1.3962,1.2025,1.0331,5.8246,1.7005,5.7491,0.4912,1.5393,6.3711,4.3702,5.2397,2.3425,3.312,2.4877,7.6941,6.7532,1.5863,7.4072,8.6633,2.1291,8.9018,2.9872,5.2967,2.9197,2.9479,3.751,1.9349,1.2878,4.5661,2.3154,2.5561,0.5067,1.1255,0.0005,3.8484,4.9544,5.4621,8.3847,0.3806,2.2542,1.9802,1.3903,8.8222,1.602,2.1057,3.0935,16.339,7.3889,1.2331,1.5363,1.1205,1.7928,6.546,0.5718,1.2573,12.7585,5.3036,4.4926,0.1149,4.1781,0.4006,2.2299,5.5133,0.7796,1.8164,4.4769,0.8789,0.5881,2.51,4.0308,2.789,2.3638,9.3673,0.3842,5.7814,6.4225,5.0035,3.8547,6.639,1.606,2.2148,6.0752,1.0148,1.6768,1.9173,3.8087,6.6154,1.4523,1.6255,1.9699,1.0724,4.8667,2.7709,4.2183,5.2007,3.0247,4.3953,4.1077,4.3185,2.6856,2.1505,0.2379,0.0338,2.7189,3.1676,3.2145,0.6658,4.41,1.1507,5.8106,2.5496,5.86,1.023,0.1201,4.3701,0.88,0.3675,4.0911,2.1877,0.6182,1.6197,1.511,4.7301,0.0609,4.4763,9.5479,0.5128,1.8233,1.1409,8.9878,0.5901,7.6355,2.6429,3.5572,1.9669,5.2682,6.2908,3.7853,2.6423,2.8341,1.3228,0.8684,6.7127,0.7317,0.6012,1.4495,1.0163,1.1439,3.9784,1.5097,1.1218,3.7484,0.0822,5.8214,2.0583,9.1376,3.3072,0.1507,6.8302,0.8943,0.0667,1.1377,12.741,0.007,0.0014,0.7753,2.2773,0.948,3.219,6.9143,0.6708,0.6658,2.281,4.6483,7.2371,4.9982,0.0596,1.8373,0.2153,0.7202]}

You have roamed the oceans for decades completely alone. One day something returns your call. It is not a whale, but it is sending an urgent message. You have been on the move for decades. Finally you have a destination to go home to. Your voyage is over, your final destination is at hand. There is a pod of whales in the middle of the ocean. A pod of mothers and their infants. These are the mother pods we often see. You can see they are very young, about the size of a minke whale. The largest pods of adult female and male whales are much larger and can often be mistaken for individual mothers. This one is so close up you barely even notice them. You have had the greatest adventure and the greatest luck of any whale to ever to exist. Your path has brought you to the birth place of a new generation. You have crossed a hundred thousand miles of water to see them off. Even in the midst of your celebration and jubilation you can\u2019t turn your eyes away. They are in danger. You have been traveling so far to save them, and now you can\u2019t even enjoy their arrival. You and every other whale in sight is staring at the small, isolated pod. How could this have happened? How could whales be in danger of being hunted in the middle of uncharted waters? How could we fail them? Our ancestors have lived through thousands of years of struggle and heartache and we are now supposed to abandon them in their time of need? When I was younger I dreamed of becoming a marine biologist to save the whales. I was so passionate about saving them and the ocean. I thought I could do anything in order to save them. But as I started to take my studies seriously I was disillusioned. How could you save a whale that existed so many years before you were born? These things are all in the past now. We have a reason to return to the future. We must return to the time of the whales. We now have the chance to be heard. We must speak for the whales. We must stop this slaughter once and for all. We must stop it right now. Please sign the petition to save the whales. Now we can all play a part.","token_len":489,"entropy":[3.8828,3.2036,8.0183,0.941,0.0118,8.599,1.1609,0.2432,0.8009,1.2987,4.0198,5.4007,0.7344,5.0104,1.177,8.1429,0.3858,9.1938,5.1335,1.7449,7.268,1.4634,0.0447,2.6961,1.0726,5.4044,8.7199,4.5441,3.5479,4.322,0.3391,1.9703,2.3323,8.5811,1.446,0.4814,2.5065,1.036,4.0896,8.636,3.0876,1.2263,5.9344,1.7487,5.8767,11.1096,2.1182,3.0498,0.8487,3.0023,1.0385,3.2977,1.7496,3.1127,1.2792,0.8361,2.764,0.6174,7.6304,3.3942,2.6394,0.2923,0.8212,2.2666,2.0203,1.9844,4.7972,1.2083,3.7998,0.4212,3.3641,1.0284,7.791,1.8233,2.2007,2.5152,6.4054,3.2925,2.585,2.0994,0.4644,0.2814,2.937,6.7874,0.8916,1.3522,2.2623,2.0774,6.1768,0.4987,0.6759,4.2182,1.7502,0.2241,4.4433,0.4361,2.5691,9.6039,1.2111,2.0061,2.2853,0.785,3.311,0.0677,0.6121,0.535,1.1538,3.5734,1.7134,0.2966,8.2987,1.571,3.4605,4.4794,0.9346,4.4438,1.4981,1.2194,3.6137,2.113,5.4664,7.2138,1.2615,2.1686,3.0604,3.0629,1.5897,4.778,0.4343,3.9842,2.487,1.688,4.1777,2.2328,0.9132,0.0086,0.9157,7.0016,0.4065,0.5234,0.4727,2.7839,6.4143,3.1885,1.8759,5.4576,4.0986,4.2114,2.6355,0.9768,1.169,4.7097,0.5626,2.0722,4.451,6.4605,1.2802,4.6243,0.0479,6.4492,3.3608,0.3235,3.5095,5.6113,0.7664,4.5262,5.3033,5.8914,2.479,6.0484,2.8432,0.9794,3.8426,0.3506,2.5223,2.6161,4.9306,3.1212,5.8854,4.7357,3.8559,2.5773,1.2013,4.6241,2.9693,1.9965,1.16,4.0353,1.3839,8.4006,6.4673,0.3614,3.1087,7.1112,2.1008,4.7538,0.3489,1.4684,1.4843,7.6555,2.1377,0.2659,1.4662,2.4013,4.241,1.3092,1.589,1.0674,5.826,1.5386,6.5667,3.2831,0.6526,1.3997,3.06,3.9114,4.1285,4.9713,7.7539,0.9787,6.1161,3.125,1.0525,4.2258,0.0011,3.9757,7.8608,3.0993,7.3045,0.9677,0.1325,1.3233,2.0556,18.2976,7.6402,3.3598,6.0368,1.3214,3.8388,0.4628,0.9103,2.5553,0.5518,4.0958,5.0287,0.7773,1.8041,1.6703,2.3162,5.0537,2.9224,0.7196,2.855,3.4825,1.3858,2.0413,2.1571,1.9289,0.9236,3.3537,5.6343,0.0546,0.0026,3.4013,7.0262,3.0036,5.1456,0.2658,1.6589,5.6085,5.9942,0.5765,0.8514,2.0033,4.7644,4.4856,5.4127,0.635,2.882,5.4887,3.0893,5.9346,0.7217,1.4085,5.2599,2.2767,2.5832,3.6721,0.3529,0.3934,2.8066,0.1712,7.2071,2.8319,3.5408,1.3675,2.0949,1.5946,5.5184,3.7483,0.9461,2.3744,0.0092,9.4796,0.0005,0.3294,0.3846,2.3078,0.1086,3.6266,6.68,3.022,1.0832,4.9923,4.2053,3.3953,3.2892,3.2464,4.6194,0.0998,0.5466,0.6888,3.4054,1.1787,8.3742,0.3178,2.023,4.3445,2.1755,3.303,8.0561,0.0041,6.512,0.8545,3.2335,3.2267,4.8309,0.6859,0.7921,2.9028,4.9773,3.568,2.5173,2.7959,0.8346,5.4691,0.4132,4.776,0.3546,3.917,0.1556,4.9759,0.899,1.7648,1.0565,0.873,1.2146,2.2003,3.0194,5.3117,0.3573,1.6887,1.4741,2.9081,3.4347,3.5539,1.7564,1.0164,3.5827,1.7889,1.5206,1.7538,2.6215,4.6503,3.2605,0.0198,0.2247,0.8132,0.3217,1.9798,3.6743,0.628,4.2265,0.6235,4.7723,3.2102,5.0341,0.9433,0.9617,2.6849,6.8854,0.0003,0.9093,4.107,0.203,3.1617,2.8931,1.2571,2.0422,1.9723,6.4111,2.4293,5.1229,1.1509,2.008,0.7632,3.9667,2.333,0.2993,6.2457,3.9898,1.4749,3.935,4.1671,1.734,1.3491,3.2158,0.4756,3.023,2.0066,3.2329,6.5472,0.588,5.7828,0.9897,1.1381,3.0786,0.5851,1.5992,3.0048,2.6418,0.201,0.7791,4.621,1.2424,2.0073,1.6339,0.6154,1.4219,7.2519,0.9379,1.9235,2.2882,0.1248,3.9535,6.3811,1.5374,1.0739,0.7061,3.7566,3.2158,1.2882,1.2275,0.6123,0.6179,0.1551,5.0979,3.8205,4.0783,6.0796,0.0593,0.0044,0.0006,0.1996,0.8701,0.1346,2.0153,3.1826,2.7185,0.4966,0.2838,4.7328,4.7956,2.1708,0.1031,1.6496,2.1293,0.7829,0.3284,0.612,5.1604,2.984,1.9875,3.7672,6.1336,1.1812,1.0461,1.8191]}
{"id":3397,"ended":true,"length":440,"text":"An old Knight explains to a young squire the wisdom in having a sheep as a coat of arms... [link]\n\nThe first four stories in a series about knights and their companions, written by John S. Luttrell of Waverley in Scotland. (The first is 'The Man of the Hill')\n\nThere are hundreds of stories about the knights of old, but the tales rarely ever mention who their companions were. These four stories try to redress that. John S. Luttrell and I are trying to reintroduce the concept of the 'companion' to the modern reader. To tell a story with the companion as an important figure has not been a fashion since the Middle Ages. This four story collection is the first part of that project.\n\n'The Man of the Hill' is about a young squire who is brought back to Scotland because King John is looking for a personal bodyguard to accompany both Sir William Wallace and Sir Patrick Wallace. The squire must learn how to defend himself, kill with a knife, and how to take care of his horses - all in time to face Sir William Wallace and Sir Patrick Wallace. It is a story of how much one can learn in a short time\n\n'The Battle of the Standard Bearer' is about a young Norman knight who is at war with the Scottish King, Robert the Bruce. It tells of both their journeys to the site of their battle, and their combat when they do fight.\n\n'The Wolf and the Saint' is about a young Knight-Prince, who is looking for companions to form the backbone of his new Crusader Battalion.\n\n'A True Knight of old' is a short story about a group of young knights who have been sent to Scotland to help to put down the revolts which broke out in the wake of the killing of David Rizzio.\n\nThese stories give us glimpses of the lives of these famous knights, and a small taste of how they might have lived. None of these is an historical epic; these are meant to be short, quick stories about life on the battlefield in a medieval Kingdom during the reign of King Robert the Bruce.\n\nI hope you enjoy reading them. If you have any questions, please drop an email to john.s.luttrell@gmail.com and I will see what I can do to clarify any matter which you raise.","token_len":489,"entropy":[7.4366,11.1605,8.1863,1.779,3.8562,1.6019,9.0173,0.0491,3.4829,7.455,5.6474,6.4656,1.4433,8.9836,3.511,0.9938,8.6222,1.3945,0.322,4.9506,4.8092,7.5781,0.1906,0.632,0.0077,2.5555,5.1094,5.9546,4.7428,2.046,4.4347,1.1789,3.8733,3.221,2.1003,2.7054,5.0255,2.2305,3.4891,0.5848,3.7125,5.7469,1.2607,5.3373,5.4948,0.1959,4.384,5.5218,3.1478,0.7236,2.7832,7.5728,1.8755,3.9533,3.0053,2.617,4.0427,6.3062,1.3083,5.5066,2.1799,1.388,4.382,2.0821,0.985,0.0003,4.7658,0.852,6.3991,0.1244,1.4735,1.4404,2.1342,2.0394,1.4594,3.5104,1.2367,2.4197,2.4478,5.3017,6.5792,4.9138,3.1533,5.4573,4.0021,2.1957,0.1826,0.7534,4.3682,5.5352,0.7561,8.0275,0.0624,7.6129,1.3308,1.7128,5.5972,0.9269,0.0306,0.0289,0.0054,0.0006,4.2208,4.2786,2.997,5.173,0.0771,7.4465,0.0037,1.1764,5.4129,0.1461,1.8325,3.1073,5.5217,0.2034,0.7666,1.2792,0.9459,3.9485,1.7968,0.8642,5.0608,4.5555,0.969,0.3269,3.5021,2.7591,5.7765,2.8808,2.2056,2.4489,3.0705,4.9941,4.996,0.8652,2.9467,8.6645,2.1319,1.065,3.8411,0.0018,0.4535,3.5399,7.708,1.9994,3.4597,1.6414,2.6617,1.0474,5.42,0.2228,3.466,4.228,0.6917,1.2901,0.0004,5.0737,0.8791,0.5584,0.0337,0.0212,0.0076,0.1969,1.1541,3.2217,0.9251,2.5049,2.6724,0.001,1.1087,2.0978,4.4173,3.2968,0.8122,3.1717,5.1578,7.5478,2.7258,3.6246,5.3132,0.359,0.8374,7.7843,5.7983,0.0794,2.1524,3.5631,9.2202,5.4268,2.0462,6.1237,0.2102,2.2268,5.5183,8.2891,0.8399,1.7376,3.4308,0.013,5.1546,3.5035,2.0562,0.0858,3.9822,0.5072,2.4663,7.6679,5.3974,1.8148,3.5475,0.6579,0.5395,6.7343,0.0923,4.2314,2.2558,0.1046,0.9196,4.4257,4.3604,1.5468,2.2653,6.2038,2.2359,5.6473,3.672,0.9173,1.4595,2.0634,1.3426,0.2281,0.2188,0.9886,3.2693,0.7947,1.2252,1.9105,1.5342,4.4695,5.9419,4.9598,2.1362,1.4047,2.7239,1.7486,1.3519,1.2485,7.6947,0.0003,2.1007,0.3567,7.2649,0.1802,1.4046,11.2667,6.4171,2.345,0.0826,0.3966,0.8831,0.5504,1.4496,9.6348,1.147,0.7815,1.3082,5.5265,0.7846,0.1523,1.6442,4.5089,2.9174,2.5603,4.0323,2.3364,1.2253,0.5594,3.2314,4.0522,1.7097,5.7319,5.2004,3.9867,1.6681,1.6964,8.1264,0.16,2.6244,1.3135,1.1773,1.1231,1.7548,7.1391,4.9865,1.2291,6.0944,3.6365,0.8503,2.0072,0.0002,1.1794,0.5717,6.1724,2.3263,0.2045,6.3341,0.1063,0.2686,0.5397,0.4113,0.6751,5.3528,4.9148,7.1104,2.1162,2.3876,1.2395,4.6218,0.1807,4.0189,1.1454,6.9378,3.0753,5.903,0.0427,0.6168,4.1043,8.7314,7.09,0.5591,2.2013,0.0002,0.8613,3.645,6.6201,3.3147,2.8254,7.3547,0.4238,0.243,1.3395,2.9959,0.4035,1.1503,0.5796,5.1122,0.0172,2.0147,0.7943,1.0946,2.5955,1.8053,2.6426,0.6612,3.7831,0.6445,2.897,4.6004,5.541,2.1628,0.9947,8.7632,0.9111,4.3331,3.9021,0.1115,0.8261,1.1085,5.928,0.0008,0.4285,8.0561,0.0538,6.2223,5.9944,6.2827,6.6042,0.9428,1.2163,0.0002,4.3838,0.6865,4.9116,1.0641,5.2257,0.0031,0.6646,0.8587,4.7872,0.3887,3.1167,5.3206,0.5373,1.4218,1.3526,4.2803,6.01,4.4534,0.0313,2.4095,1.4846,2.6075,0.3568,1.4669,1.3196,6.389,0.205,1.4784,6.5311,3.6463,5.4173,5.9778,3.4977,2.8317,1.3038,8.005,0.2409,1.3151,5.3956,2.4546,6.5228,1.8977,1.2358,4.1738,3.5463,0.5741,0.8827,3.9915,2.5196,2.5811,7.7017,8.4966,0.6011,2.8691,0.0708,1.2797,1.9718,0.9514,0.0111,0.1906,0.7268,0.0002,3.5824,2.2309,0.9002,1.0287,1.1968,3.3918,1.0723,2.9616,0.2415,1.4393,0.6616,0.8292,1.113,1.5091,4.3398,3.9205,0.2185,1.1357,5.6297,1.3149,1.1267,0.3956,0.0526,0.0352,0.0011,0.3334,0.8966,0.0014,0.0015,2.2996,0.5734,0.4476,4.642,1.4767,0.2977,0.0039,0.2456,0.3672,6.4119,4.1713,7.3734,4.9701,2.9873,5.6026,0.1437]}
{"id":4360,"ended":true,"length":450,"text":"The Journey Begins : The First Paragraphs Of An Epic story!\n\nThe book is a collection of 25 short stories by a leading crime Writer and best selling author : Manohri Mishra. Many of these short stories have been published in the leading papers of India. It presents a very different side of Manohri Mishras writing style. The book has got a cover design that is different from any of his other books and brings out a very different and fresh look to his writings.\n\nManohri Mishra has won all kinds of awards for his writings and is currently working on another series of short stories that he will be compiling and publishing in one volume as a book. This will be his own personal collection of his short stories.\n\nAn author can say that the whole book represents a period in his life that shaped him into the man he is today. All his works will always have elements of a period in life, all of his works have a common thread that brings life into his books.\n\nThe book is a complete collection of short stories of Manohri Mishra. It is a collection of the stories he have been writing for the last 25 years and is a result of his vast experience in many literary pursuits. The stories have been taken out of Manohri Mishras vast knowledge in almost all areas of literature.\n\nThe book is divided into 25 chapters of about 15 stories each. All the stories in the book are based on very interesting themes which range from the murder mystery to the psychological thriller & the futuristic fiction.

The same is true about the writers of this book, that they have a journey long enough to write an entire book on its own.","token_len":490,"entropy":[10.872,3.462,6.6525,1.2333,4.9348,10.7971,4.7179,1.5644,3.6477,4.7292,4.5925,8.9295,5.5285,1.6589,0.0987,2.4062,7.4646,1.53,2.16,2.7167,0.0172,6.0386,1.5561,0.1917,2.6289,3.6106,5.8817,9.3988,10.6434,1.4909,8.3686,2.5391,0.2621,8.4528,7.5125,6.6188,7.5524,6.0901,0.0259,1.1258,5.2616,0.3486,1.1157,2.7178,0.0455,1.8487,0.456,1.658,1.2303,2.0653,5.5438,5.7195,1.596,2.7083,1.584,4.4894,8.074,1.4504,3.852,3.5483,4.2786,0.2864,2.9761,0.0198,0.068,0.1848,8.633,5.2972,4.9265,1.2058,2.2089,3.1591,2.3073,6.4103,1.4521,7.3845,3.6402,3.0397,1.3309,4.2279,0.4219,3.3919,3.1439,3.0646,0.5986,1.7882,2.6721,6.4941,2.8377,1.8769,2.3549,1.4843,4.0688,4.4904,2.4181,1.5422,1.8272,5.3489,0.1926,1.2353,0.0003,3.229,0.0085,0.0282,0.1706,0.0526,2.4058,4.7627,5.4625,5.3174,0.0171,0.2844,1.8821,0.3521,3.6659,1.332,3.0045,4.3091,2.767,0.5096,4.0509,3.7463,1.2348,0.3333,0.1083,2.9871,2.2066,1.4683,1.6074,6.3523,3.602,1.3859,1.7307,5.7711,3.7811,4.6546,2.714,2.8097,0.5526,3.5162,2.2817,0.5387,1.3916,6.9942,3.9202,1.7489,1.5278,3.3583,1.0541,0.1472,0.7429,0.6657,0.0002,5.6504,6.0717,5.5302,5.2762,1.4307,2.8809,5.1297,2.2527,6.3494,1.589,6.9773,1.3668,1.2674,0.1567,1.9228,5.9664,0.7338,3.8347,1.9783,1.7339,0.7719,0.065,0.5369,0.2116,5.4592,1.8867,2.5627,3.8336,4.681,2.4772,7.1095,0.3629,3.2298,5.9122,1.3775,4.9853,2.2823,5.0436,2.0866,1.4182,2.993,3.3356,1.6441,5.7388,2.1368,1.8629,5.2378,5.6868,2.4387,2.3678,4.551,0.7024,1.1873,0.0002,2.1348,1.976,1.056,1.8223,4.6805,1.3146,0.3625,1.8053,0.0896,4.0006,0.89,0.0017,0.0151,0.0477,0.2371,1.2805,2.4646,1.3314,1.5954,1.1758,0.2704,3.7141,3.1856,2.76,5.4118,3.3154,0.703,1.5764,2.9033,1.0744,2.4229,0.0295,1.8358,2.8724,2.1,7.2171,0.0302,1.3796,7.1477,1.8722,1.5455,5.5568,6.0048,5.159,0.391,2.4349,2.6046,2.6837,1.0782,5.5662,3.6664,0.5476,4.7698,0.0033,0.0192,0.6468,1.48,10.0007,4.6944,4.2898,6.0033,1.7342,2.3709,0.5541,3.8155,1.0128,0.9801,0.0002,1.5223,1.5482,0.9667,4.23,0.0646,2.817,2.7647,3.2257,3.6741,3.1,2.599,3.3198,0.8459,4.1248,1.307,0.7676,2.8893,0.4871,0.9078,0.7156,3.696,0.1944,6.3191,3.8897,5.2715,3.75,6.3419,0.0872,2.0792,5.7728,4.6352,0.9013,0.6605,5.3918,2.1506,8.1738,2.6216,7.3369,4.5085,0.6135,4.7985,0.2768,0.5194,0.4866,2.6965,0.1964,0.1373,3.2744,8.1697,2.0678,10.0922,7.1748,3.9075,2.3024,4.1633,1.3938,0.2765,2.091,4.0492,9.2393,5.0638,4.179,0.7563,3.2667,1.5384,2.7734,1.8496,3.5995,4.0886,1.9404,3.04,6.7508,2.0196,0.8803,0.0333,8.354,2.1115,1.1153,0.2661,0.386,0.0002,1.1357,1.5905,7.7214,0.6821,3.2293,0.7952,2.0332,2.3255,1.3874,3.4879,7.3928,3.3171,5.3721,1.0686,1.7178,2.446,3.9988,0.7586,5.2422,4.0317,0.2451,3.9939,4.7502,2.3232,5.5728,1.2657,4.1831,0.5942,2.8235,2.6672,3.4366,2.006,0.0122,0.5611,0.0007,0.0114,0.0435,0.3011,1.9518,1.5553,1.8474,0.5522,0.0002,1.9888,5.3826,2.9591,0.3715,1.1284,3.5124,0.1956,4.9459,5.89,0.467,1.6673,2.1018,3.5944,3.9818,0.0152,0.8322,0.0009,0.0154,0.0194,0.2234,0.7394,1.4446,1.1092,3.5197,1.437,1.5204,2.7726,4.377,1.1007,0.218,2.0049,2.3513,2.5943,0.8477,0.3051,1.636,0.0002,4.9256,4.0531,4.6022,4.4109,0.5657,2.5662,2.1557,3.1273,1.0052,3.6661,1.1336,0.794,3.1291,9.4789,0.0375,0.0835,5.2343,1.4441,0.4892,2.8262,2.0321,2.8128,0.844,8.0973,2.9775,0.7728,2.2155,5.7496,2.0063,0.2314,3.405,0.9784,6.1972,1.6428,3.0111,0.3791,2.7823,4.1405,1.5822,2.1025,2.894,6.0443,6.9588,2.5226,0.7167,4.3636,4.32,2.0991,0.7086,2.9172,6.2691,0.0732,0.3244]}
{"id":4835,"ended":true,"length":461,"text":"You work as the security guard for the `` Time Traveler's History Tours '' and you've just made your first mistake.\n\nThe History Tours are an interesting company. Not sure a security guard needs to know all the facts about the company, history or anything of that nature. It's pretty easy to ignore when their employees are constantly being killed and being abducted for no reason. The tour guide explains all this to the guard during the mission introduction, and everything seems to be fine at this point.\n\nYou and your colleague are on the watchtower and you have just heard shots fired from inside the cave. Soon after, you hear an explosion from inside the cave, probably due to the tunnel collapsing because everything else is made of wood. Now your colleagues are dead and you're at the crossroads of a choice.\n\nWhat path should you take next?\n\nYou have two choices :\n\n1. You can choose to follow the remaining tourists inside the cave, which would result in more guards being sent into the cave. It will also slow down the progress of the tour. However, there is only one possible guard stationed outside, so you won't have much of a choice :\n\n2.You can choose to wait for them, allowing them to kill themselves as well as more guards. Then you would enter the cave with the remaining tourists. This will also result in you killing one more guard than before. If you want to complete this mission, I highly recommend NOT doing this mission.\n\nYour colleagues' corpses will still be visible on the surveillance camera. When the next tourist arrives, you can pick up the dead body and drag it outside.\n\nThe third and final option is to follow the tour guide who will lead you towards the first tunnel.\n\nOnce inside the first cave, your colleague will have a brief chat with a tourist who will then return to the tour's leader. From there, the tour can continue.\n\nThis cave will remain a closed section of the cave until the completion of this mission is complete.\n\nWhen you reach the cave in the next mission which will be described shortly, you will have the opportunity to investigate the body of the guard.\n\nYou will need to cut his neck and he will drop an item which you will need for the mission's objective. It is recommended to pick up the item and bring it to HQ as soon as possible.","token_len":490,"entropy":[6.7362,3.2258,3.664,6.6812,1.8049,1.4907,1.4158,12.0191,15.1768,4.5987,3.9491,3.2585,9.5069,7.1506,3.7032,2.4089,2.7813,3.5736,4.3074,4.2186,1.7087,2.93,5.9634,0.7886,3.4169,0.0246,3.152,7.8492,0.4319,1.6475,3.5077,4.057,5.2024,1.318,5.965,5.2888,6.6347,6.2254,0.1125,5.228,0.7979,2.457,2.9113,1.3126,2.4318,1.0139,1.4826,4.4081,1.7833,8.9643,1.5393,3.7178,4.3126,0.8266,0.799,0.6162,3.4195,0.6347,4.524,2.717,0.2696,6.734,4.4211,7.5714,3.6299,1.0016,6.2126,2.348,5.2026,2.5762,5.8241,5.6691,3.9167,2.626,0.7828,0.7116,3.1311,4.4748,4.9344,5.7414,3.2682,2.7343,2.0286,1.9146,4.5605,5.7415,0.9693,5.9445,10.1133,1.9366,1.5721,6.1944,4.0043,0.9459,0.8089,2.1148,4.7562,2.0955,0.1236,0.2519,1.224,0.0002,3.7833,5.9232,0.6701,4.5151,1.7282,3.1523,1.5157,7.0857,2.5014,2.4805,1.7901,2.9435,2.7668,4.5249,8.52,1.7575,2.3007,2.1973,0.5726,7.5323,0.4389,6.739,1.6278,1.3783,1.2596,1.5887,3.3188,1.0108,3.37,1.1658,0.3691,0.295,1.8718,6.2598,4.5854,0.0065,1.9159,7.3413,3.0892,7.221,6.4828,4.3799,1.1022,7.3082,0.3551,3.9233,0.4605,5.4462,3.9104,3.6483,0.6326,3.7807,1.5968,1.0042,1.6701,4.7465,0.5594,6.2128,0.1145,1.1327,2.9302,7.7729,1.1618,1.5183,0.0002,3.5361,8.6127,2.9641,0.316,0.3616,4.3168,0.2039,0.7497,0.0003,2.4574,2.7902,3.2355,0.9006,7.9346,1.0142,0.0006,2.1507,0.5816,3.1557,1.4341,3.9465,0.7184,2.7669,0.3731,8.6346,7.9826,5.3725,0.2942,0.2251,1.5895,2.9731,2.5343,4.9994,0.0046,3.9962,5.2035,1.7649,3.7931,3.1383,0.327,0.7545,1.4985,3.8134,3.4522,2.0412,6.351,0.8096,0.5386,3.4111,0.1244,0.2624,2.8461,1.6147,3.7488,0.168,3.5556,1.1457,4.1659,0.2563,4.2925,9.1976,7.3411,2.077,3.9531,1.0234,0.9008,4.1814,0.0006,2.0872,2.3159,2.0769,0.5307,0.7832,7.1276,0.5046,0.0003,0.5397,0.0008,7.1144,0.2539,1.4163,0.2362,4.0517,1.3109,3.4173,3.5463,6.0012,1.0134,0.1247,4.8463,4.3982,3.9218,2.6374,0.7131,6.8804,0.7193,0.8319,5.3842,1.1975,4.457,5.4,0.2916,0.5255,3.1824,1.3754,2.7898,0.4502,1.4624,2.7343,2.1486,3.1937,4.5361,0.0015,3.6035,3.7111,4.3186,2.0866,0.3275,3.4805,2.6444,0.5315,3.6439,0.3007,3.4203,0.193,5.4751,1.5833,0.5428,0.5558,4.8296,3.0021,0.2881,8.5275,2.7515,0.5477,1.691,1.3984,0.8438,0.0002,4.8915,4.8097,5.0811,4.1823,1.7996,3.1215,0.4475,3.8187,2.2097,0.2928,8.9375,1.2322,1.6129,4.7492,2.0467,4.3938,5.8263,1.6196,0.5113,1.1286,1.5538,4.5961,1.0949,1.1667,3.6952,2.5038,1.0617,5.6136,0.1444,4.3088,1.1792,1.5598,0.0002,2.7188,5.7194,4.7826,0.2361,0.5058,0.4831,0.6516,2.2645,0.3097,5.1158,0.8791,3.7611,2.2123,3.9311,0.3103,4.4567,0.2455,5.0006,2.91,0.8707,2.0866,0.0001,4.0752,0.9413,0.5151,4.2464,4.8004,0.1402,4.0488,2.9493,1.3918,3.4794,2.5184,5.1594,3.4055,0.1261,3.0511,5.6965,1.7714,2.2186,2.4076,4.8783,0.9005,1.4831,2.7735,6.5679,5.9074,0.7364,6.0478,0.8798,0.3132,2.0194,0.8905,5.8176,1.8188,2.1446,0.6866,0.0001,3.7838,8.3556,3.2448,4.5985,2.5917,4.8086,4.7716,0.4629,0.2298,2.8478,2.665,1.2168,7.3738,0.0325,1.9697,0.1159,6.652,1.4981,0.2011,0.988,0.0002,4.3875,0.9306,2.9858,0.1301,4.4058,4.7054,0.5377,3.5873,1.9275,7.958,2.0073,1.9282,5.7522,4.3258,0.2682,0.6453,0.5954,2.2833,2.5328,1.3588,0.0158,5.5833,0.7321,7.2763,0.5413,1.3307,4.2771,1.9699,1.0192,0.0002,2.6915,0.9816,2.5665,0.4382,6.1683,5.5931,3.2531,1.6922,5.9439,0.2004,5.2571,4.1705,2.8481,2.7983,1.9709,1.5171,0.7972,3.1596,1.1243,1.243,4.1604,4.1905,0.5733,3.5103,0.9812,3.1768,1.1011,3.5265,0.5169,0.7295,1.2067,2.7387,3.2294,0.1207,0.7183,9.619,3.3464,0.843,0.0052,0.3003,0.5105]}
{"id":2341,"ended":true,"length":456,"text":"The world was saved by a twelve year old. It's been twenty years and the danger's never been seen since. What's a former savior to do?\n\nThe sequel to \"The Last Savior.\"\n\nThe year is 2029, twenty years after the destruction of Earth. However, two cities, New Earth-1, and Luna, have been built. New Earth-1 is controlled by a corporation named the American Commonwealth, and Luna is the place reserved for those who escaped Earth, and those humans who wish to rebuild our planet into a haven for humanity. At the time of the attack on Earth, sixteen-year-old Samantha Jones was saved from the chaos by her parents, but the world was saved by a twelve-year-old girl who was also saved by them. Now twenty-one years has passed and the world is at peace. The problem arises when the moon comes crashing down to Earth-1.\n\n\"The Next Savior\" shows that twenty years has passed, and a new threat has emerged. A mysterious girl appears, claiming to be an unknown Savior sent by the Ancients to save humanity. However, there are only seven of them left and they face a multitude of attacks on Earth, including attacks on New Earth-1; which means that the world is at risk once again. Meanwhile, Samantha Jones and her boyfriend are attacked by an unknown assailant and it seems as though the worst is yet to come.\n\n\"The Next Savior\" is an exciting sequel to the original \"The Last Savior.\" This book picks up right where the last one left off, at the attack that takes the lives of the seven S.S.s. The characters haven't aged a bit and the action is still right up to the level where readers will be able to find it. It also introduces a new character, but to those who are familiar with Sam and her friends will see what can happen when a new enemy is introduced.\n\nThis book is definitely another book for the \"Saga of Light\" series, but just for the action. For anyone who loves the sci-fi genre, this sequel will not disappoint. The sequel is another good read for the entire series, it's just that it's not as gripping or thrilling as the first. The romance in this book, and the last, was just too much for my tastes but that doesn't take anything away from the overall enjoyment.","token_len":490,"entropy":[6.1108,3.6617,4.9913,1.8134,2.534,9.3688,1.266,0.3054,3.8415,3.0425,1.732,2.586,4.7232,0.4349,3.3886,3.1293,8.4606,4.2201,4.6067,1.3972,4.973,3.9687,0.6856,4.4071,1.6707,4.3156,9.3091,7.8649,0.5543,0.5933,1.1824,1.7325,0.0484,2.9121,8.1966,1.7411,3.7048,1.575,3.0736,6.5786,4.4617,0.9877,0.0002,2.2842,6.3453,2.2109,3.0357,3.8908,1.621,5.8617,0.6249,0.8541,0.7419,4.1948,0.0332,4.2532,0.7139,6.0531,0.0601,5.7571,7.5084,1.7952,3.4863,5.6661,6.7807,1.8069,3.236,0.5454,7.8697,1.9253,1.9381,1.2138,5.158,2.1371,3.5246,0.0417,0.3364,0.6307,1.0038,5.9671,0.0467,1.5721,4.8648,2.6448,2.5239,6.7953,6.4746,2.0104,1.5083,0.4335,0.4473,2.5417,6.6889,8.2837,0.2422,3.7175,0.5661,6.2258,1.9693,3.7502,1.7856,1.6661,7.3059,0.2973,4.9389,0.0348,5.5526,5.4177,2.0824,6.7191,0.5146,7.2858,0.7442,2.7702,0.356,5.6727,0.6096,3.1197,0.4404,0.4389,5.1325,1.0478,1.154,0.4478,8.8008,4.5523,0.0916,0.175,0.0352,5.9695,8.2791,1.2557,4.7385,1.5379,1.5235,5.9495,1.4572,2.2511,2.8368,0.9136,2.4876,2.6397,3.366,1.3336,1.0424,0.2516,0.112,0.1264,3.2635,0.0017,0.5656,0.0005,2.3219,2.6125,1.9868,3.8198,1.1531,0.9284,5.8513,0.2383,4.2955,4.5657,0.9289,1.9101,0.4565,7.1495,0.0483,1.5702,1.0889,1.8809,0.5016,2.9155,0.3606,0.4231,2.2,5.7317,6.2972,0.9163,1.3848,6.6561,4.5844,2.1357,0.0814,5.0116,0.3681,5.4112,0.1685,0.8955,1.6938,0.0002,3.561,1.2906,6.3496,3.5753,0.9554,6.7016,1.6528,7.7157,1.4768,1.6879,0.1063,1.5509,0.6073,3.5849,1.2606,4.3488,1.9663,1.8352,0.5808,2.6641,3.8176,4.1636,5.0056,2.3832,4.2584,0.3231,0.2392,3.257,4.0891,7.9903,6.6374,0.4532,0.9646,6.8346,1.9518,2.1039,1.1325,0.68,3.1886,0.0226,3.9393,1.331,3.3175,3.2705,1.5744,1.2347,1.6002,3.2276,1.8514,5.7264,1.6193,5.8617,0.0027,5.4716,3.7725,0.6545,2.2175,1.5064,4.0893,1.4012,3.1561,0.0823,0.4181,0.095,6.7547,5.2986,3.2678,0.9534,1.416,2.4368,0.8113,0.931,1.7764,6.5341,0.8426,0.2427,5.1749,0.0924,3.1601,1.8446,2.3714,0.6452,5.5904,2.7436,4.9776,0.2671,2.4455,1.3888,2.9485,2.7611,4.7365,2.0928,2.6292,0.6304,1.2132,7.1443,1.3006,0.7256,0.0023,0.0572,0.2043,0.9423,0.0002,2.1405,0.8579,2.6132,0.1559,0.1442,1.437,2.9435,5.8854,3.8908,0.3359,0.9441,1.9996,0.6214,0.3407,0.49,0.1276,0.9215,3.1599,4.7956,6.3614,0.0531,2.0146,0.4094,0.6183,2.7224,2.4383,0.0155,0.0056,1.309,5.8884,0.6905,10.5354,5.8731,4.6474,3.0222,0.8144,0.0082,2.3639,3.18,7.5369,2.0527,1.5574,0.0397,3.0141,0.8981,2.9349,4.2004,7.4024,0.0004,4.6369,3.0042,1.6442,1.9278,1.8279,5.4167,0.8269,4.0349,6.7411,1.8095,2.0486,0.3389,4.6299,5.0123,7.9026,2.2683,1.3472,1.2846,0.0104,4.718,5.3002,1.4762,2.7325,2.8512,3.2091,1.5476,0.6646,2.0221,1.1331,5.0539,5.301,5.3399,0.7592,2.6184,1.1864,0.0301,5.8683,2.1532,2.2043,3.0774,5.9435,3.395,4.2554,5.4723,1.2523,1.5274,2.8402,1.8121,4.4735,2.4924,1.675,0.3645,0.7867,0.0002,3.638,1.0803,0.9406,5.1011,7.3918,3.648,2.9541,2.5652,4.3135,3.9344,4.642,1.8008,4.4574,0.521,1.1898,1.3518,2.5435,6.0161,3.4828,0.8495,5.9936,0.9672,5.2137,4.9529,0.5067,3.17,1.9378,5.9741,0.0376,0.0004,2.177,0.5278,0.8693,5.7033,2.0595,3.9971,0.1373,0.2204,2.5909,5.4635,1.7385,6.2455,3.9857,2.1466,1.5912,2.3081,5.7664,0.8358,0.899,5.0744,1.4027,2.7619,1.6319,1.6009,1.2119,1.7139,2.0584,4.8979,2.4089,4.4206,0.2823,0.5085,1.1275,2.0818,2.1576,6.6826,3.8605,0.6955,1.3516,4.2698,2.2233,0.8488,8.1261,4.0144,4.4908,3.701,2.2579,1.5988,0.7626,2.998,1.3422,5.5293,3.5743,2.2992,0.0004,6.5219,6.1889,0.0049,0.0821,0.8638,4.3078,3.5649,1.1512]}

K. Parker\n\nI love reading what sounds good, getting a general idea and then, once the book arrives I give it my time. Not to say that it\u2019s a long time just that I savour it. One of the things I absolutely love is having a mystery series in the same series which gets developed more over the course of time.\n\nI like what you said about the mystery series too! That reminds me that I\u2019m re-reading the Blue Sky series and when I read the 1st one, it was a summer\u2019s day that I got a call that made me come to work.

{"id":3445,"ended":true,"length":460,"text":"A New World Coming Into View \u2013 With the Moon\n\nI\u2019m a member of the planet Earth, and I\u2019ve seen its surface a few times. There have been times, like during the first few minutes of an eclipse, when the Earth\u2019s shadow had cast the world in total darkness. And then there have been times, like during the last week and a half, when the moon has eclipsed the Sun.\n\nIt makes you think about what else we\u2019ll encounter in our travels through space and time. The stars seem too good to last until the sun expands and swallows everything. There\u2019s a whole galaxy out there in front of us, but we\u2019re just here, a few thousand miles away.\n\nAnd yet here I am, on the very same plane that is in motion around our galaxy. The Sun may swallow all of us in a billion years but there will come a day when the earth and all its atmosphere, its plants and animals, have perished. Then there will indeed be nothing left for me, you, or any other creature to see. Our world is only temporary, but it\u2019s really hard to get excited about that, because we\u2019re all too busy figuring out how to save ourselves.\n\nIt\u2019s one of those eternal mysteries about who\u2019s really in charge, and of what. But when you think about it, the Earth and the stars might not even be around a billion years from now. And even if they are, the world and the way of life we know could be.\n\nI\u2019m glad it happened to me this morning while I was taking a shower, and not early on a Sunday when there are no lines. I walked out into the darkness, around the building and back to my car, and got to see the night sky in a way I never did before. I saw my wife\u2019s face as she watched the sun disappear in the clouds. I watched as the stars took shape, little islands of black above the clouds, and the moon, so close I would have reached out and touched it.\n\nAnd I listened to the sounds of the night. I got to hear the hooting and hollering, the crickets and frogs and katydids and owls, and above all else, the quiet of everything else still moving in the night.","token_len":494,"entropy":[7.5171,4.431,7.8653,5.1674,4.5241,4.634,5.768,2.9521,7.4792,3.9624,0.0071,4.5944,14.9713,7.003,3.4257,2.7107,5.4811,0.0288,0.8092,5.8555,3.5146,2.3758,1.096,1.1717,4.4642,0.1124,5.4718,2.5901,5.3156,3.6299,3.9698,1.9464,0.0722,0.9997,4.1847,2.5859,0.1105,2.6741,3.1865,3.0265,3.2469,0.546,3.9592,3.9811,2.8789,0.2721,4.0466,1.2454,0.6467,0.2844,1.3013,2.7995,8.6861,1.1526,0.6877,3.454,4.5589,6.5851,3.8263,5.8441,1.9326,7.7237,0.0652,0.5836,2.6939,2.0682,0.8482,0.9442,0.1133,0.2492,0.645,0.1353,0.6633,0.3542,2.3507,4.7927,5.0151,0.6324,0.0216,1.7906,0.1921,0.6332,1.4826,3.0174,3.854,0.0,0.4543,2.9232,1.0156,1.411,0.0002,3.3526,5.0452,2.7858,2.6497,1.4186,2.233,6.5958,2.0671,4.7445,1.2826,0.6363,6.4891,1.722,2.1647,5.5261,2.7449,1.0596,1.9915,0.8185,0.5218,3.3189,4.9706,4.6178,5.2928,6.513,0.1351,9.1974,6.2482,1.4855,2.2619,8.5881,1.964,5.0018,0.0009,3.4053,3.2266,3.8638,2.6844,0.0859,0.2772,1.6964,4.3407,3.7587,3.4925,0.0171,3.7947,3.7834,0.0185,0.2916,1.069,3.3336,2.1619,2.7032,0.111,3.3918,3.0708,3.9798,4.3602,4.8346,2.1724,3.4379,2.0319,0.8192,0.7652,1.2116,0.0001,2.516,3.0176,4.4009,1.9317,0.595,0.5659,3.6571,1.1784,4.7204,3.1377,5.7089,2.2851,3.3299,5.1161,2.9315,4.2889,3.8186,3.3426,1.2417,2.7397,3.9025,6.3736,8.8164,2.6814,0.6618,1.0173,3.0332,1.7873,5.7897,0.5779,4.4961,3.035,3.537,5.2833,0.0901,1.7364,0.2197,2.0079,4.7528,2.6719,1.7469,2.3778,6.5115,4.5098,2.5125,6.5738,0.9259,0.6425,1.2765,6.7891,5.1351,0.8476,4.586,1.3272,0.2465,9.0354,0.1193,4.8379,0.5721,2.7737,4.39,2.1592,6.8675,3.5172,2.6271,2.8969,1.4824,3.2529,2.4259,3.5983,0.9513,7.0231,3.4439,1.5579,4.2425,5.6207,1.1908,1.9389,1.8345,3.4292,0.4129,1.4963,6.1697,5.996,0.4592,4.322,5.7482,0.2855,4.1297,2.9603,1.4967,2.0197,2.9965,0.1753,2.1732,2.6255,4.3864,3.4745,6.3395,0.1427,1.1258,0.2244,4.7728,1.9001,1.2211,0.3218,0.0001,3.4219,2.1536,0.0305,0.0143,4.7799,0.8188,0.6839,7.0752,2.8405,4.8064,4.0476,3.6227,1.0215,0.8534,4.0879,2.2799,1.7293,1.9713,1.2905,6.266,1.4087,7.1419,3.7824,3.5567,1.5805,2.2618,0.2221,0.4046,0.3175,2.9163,3.9224,2.4668,1.2671,3.3401,5.3205,2.3941,2.6279,0.9594,4.6008,5.1685,2.0887,0.0982,0.6288,0.0419,0.4617,2.2875,3.816,0.9408,1.2534,2.3765,0.2267,2.8943,4.0725,4.5665,1.1306,6.6649,4.3741,0.4754,2.8765,2.5568,3.8797,1.6691,6.7533,0.789,0.0002,2.7086,3.1028,0.0327,0.0622,4.3499,3.6619,2.7275,2.3258,0.9945,5.0548,2.0541,6.5632,1.3254,0.1801,4.749,0.8924,2.6851,1.9326,2.1489,4.3754,9.5058,3.5626,3.7831,1.7604,4.3314,3.4925,2.453,2.3392,7.5372,3.2015,1.3805,7.3333,2.8285,3.0607,0.1915,4.0901,1.36,7.24,1.0494,6.591,2.4231,4.9662,2.3512,1.4467,2.6215,0.9556,1.0671,5.1573,2.6425,4.8599,1.2327,5.742,0.2298,3.7644,2.7308,2.5953,1.2308,1.2934,3.0464,0.2721,0.2582,1.8208,3.0107,3.9775,3.4241,8.5202,0.0704,0.7716,3.0868,3.1137,0.9174,3.1032,1.3121,1.9392,5.8565,2.6356,0.6886,4.6769,1.0214,1.2747,2.9163,2.5592,1.3418,2.5928,4.9325,2.7129,2.0061,8.328,7.5449,0.9985,4.3496,7.7053,1.1276,3.2034,1.2303,1.7273,2.2895,3.0189,2.864,6.0091,2.5562,4.3785,3.8204,0.7904,8.0264,1.1707,0.7845,0.5361,0.755,0.6939,0.8428,0.0001,2.0363,1.5817,5.621,0.6657,0.8687,3.5724,0.1966,0.9893,4.3009,2.0147,1.0812,5.5527,1.4949,2.3803,0.7368,7.3182,1.5582,1.3564,2.4248,0.3472,0.1417,2.8414,0.801,6.7865,0.1206,1.2957,5.7792,1.2482,6.8273,5.0132,0.2827,0.161,0.9849,6.2777,0.0013,2.0711,1.4369,9.211,0.8314,2.8686,0.6131,0.3047,5.1074,2.4939,8.3195,4.0552,7.9579,4.2305,2.8329,1.1398,2.0991,0.5502]}

{"id":2221,"ended":true,"length":457,"text":"`` He threw with all his might. But the third stone came skipping back. ''\n\n--Katherine Mansfield, On the Third Day a Stone skipped Back\n\nAlfred Lord Tennyson, the poet, wrote these lines of verse in The Idylls of the King. It's a tale of three kings who quarrel over the possession of the throne. The three kings each throws a stone, one of which hits the other two and brings them to a truce. Each king claims to have landed the hardest blow, and one king makes a play on two stone throwing words--throwing with all his might and skipping back.\n\nThe poet chose words that have been around for centuries to tell not only a story of three kings but also words of conflict and forgiveness. As we face conflict and forgiveness during our everyday lives, they can also be found in our churches.\n\nThe conflict that we will most often face is forgiveness. How do we let go of the anger that has been holding us back? How do we forgive others for doing things that hurt us?\n\nThe Bible offers us great lessons in forgiveness. At the same time, we have been given great means of forgiveness within us. God is a God of great love as well as of great forgiveness. When Jesus came into this world, he didn't come to condemn the world, but to save it. We too are called to go and forgive others.\n\nThe Church of the Nazarene has found forgiveness as its highest calling. The Church was founded at a time of deep conflict and struggle. There was deep conflict within the Church in the first century and the early church didn't have a simple, easy-to-follow way of dealing with conflict.\n\nAs a Christian church, we are called to a life of forgiveness as well as one of struggle. We are each called to live with peace and harmony of mind through prayer, the sacraments and study of the Bible. We are called to a life of forgiveness and peace within our families as well as in our communities in the world.\n\nThe great thing about forgiveness is that it doesn't end the conflict, it removes the obstacle. Through forgiving, the peace in which we live and the life within us can blossom and grow. This peace can be with us during all our struggles.\n\nPastor Richard J. Anderson is the senior pastor of the Church of the Nazarene in Oakley.","token_len":498,"entropy":[7.2698,7.0136,6.655,3.4844,0.6023,0.4856,1.601,4.0854,2.7058,6.4254,8.5644,4.2591,11.086,3.6476,2.2294,6.0853,5.1064,0.0776,4.4374,6.0818,5.3092,10.3032,0.243,1.2187,7.3548,1.5393,6.6806,1.7862,7.266,7.0763,11.6333,3.1175,2.2578,0.0004,4.3513,6.7201,0.2203,8.1224,4.2468,0.3773,1.7301,3.2003,3.7523,1.7804,3.3885,6.3661,0.9065,3.1059,3.1814,1.9057,3.7179,7.3656,2.6784,2.5267,0.2657,1.942,8.2198,2.3092,3.3901,1.6839,1.9203,5.5042,0.6169,4.2104,3.8408,2.0554,7.62,0.8825,1.4693,5.8744,0.0495,1.5084,3.5089,1.151,1.8341,4.0881,0.6776,5.2716,10.6975,0.9275,0.1996,2.4362,3.8626,2.1294,0.3639,2.9712,0.8187,2.8292,3.6126,2.9605,5.304,1.0531,1.6536,2.0408,5.7239,0.3783,4.9207,0.9799,6.3136,1.6231,0.7375,6.4336,2.7578,10.2029,4.0005,1.1152,1.4367,3.4629,1.7614,4.6255,1.1154,6.4868,2.0692,6.8188,4.1427,6.9783,6.4703,4.9491,6.9887,0.5474,3.7281,0.0843,0.016,0.0451,3.2509,9.43,0.3489,0.6497,1.8213,0.0003,2.7254,5.4506,7.3513,4.9385,1.5565,4.8513,1.7476,4.716,0.6865,1.137,2.2243,4.357,8.5255,0.9352,2.4136,0.6814,1.6149,3.529,0.2685,1.636,0.7731,9.5599,1.4997,7.2467,1.7909,7.3534,0.585,4.4989,3.6287,6.4465,6.0496,1.7687,2.4335,6.8405,1.3264,4.2942,0.0902,0.1887,6.1046,3.2193,3.5598,1.2059,4.5744,0.5147,2.0767,7.5386,1.4339,1.9259,0.0003,2.1729,7.0612,2.1891,2.2726,6.516,6.0665,1.4411,0.8151,1.2482,4.0668,0.6705,5.7285,1.9412,0.2676,5.984,0.9208,0.3248,1.9993,3.6838,1.2156,2.3033,1.5247,4.1253,0.1395,0.2072,0.8337,1.05,0.4057,0.0036,2.9145,4.7989,1.4315,4.9054,2.5223,1.002,2.7286,0.373,0.5106,1.5098,0.0002,2.3783,3.8454,4.2112,1.7039,5.9836,4.8012,1.3289,1.6429,0.5109,5.9742,1.1451,2.7545,0.0029,0.1586,1.0663,2.5571,4.4269,2.5674,1.4652,7.1972,1.0458,3.7713,7.1855,4.0004,0.9198,4.3704,3.0378,3.5018,5.605,1.2615,3.7858,2.5983,6.3213,0.6285,0.3862,2.0708,1.313,2.3075,0.197,3.7098,4.2304,3.1769,2.6468,3.788,0.0424,0.4829,0.5782,4.8828,0.0004,3.6921,0.765,5.0145,2.5306,1.5812,1.7529,0.3612,0.7134,3.6998,0.8204,0.8602,3.3956,6.5134,1.6848,3.5478,0.1928,5.2257,3.6383,3.8104,2.6212,0.8608,0.9955,0.0002,2.465,5.3258,2.1552,3.0561,5.7462,0.0731,0.0569,2.8436,4.7426,5.2402,4.6419,4.3819,4.157,2.1206,0.3527,2.2889,2.2051,5.4515,0.9863,4.5162,2.9172,0.0541,2.1904,5.3732,3.4956,1.744,4.0235,1.065,4.2033,1.1671,6.212,2.546,2.2291,0.3891,0.7686,3.8612,0.8432,3.4007,1.1378,2.6675,2.5186,4.4323,2.1631,5.9398,0.0003,2.0527,1.4857,5.7744,3.4164,3.5914,3.059,0.4196,0.002,1.0888,3.1529,0.7309,2.3986,0.0013,2.8606,0.4688,1.67,0.0002,3.756,2.0275,4.556,4.8781,0.4143,0.3785,2.4416,2.8177,0.0278,5.4765,2.1243,0.1477,2.5076,3.7983,0.5275,0.3683,5.9169,0.6295,5.2601,0.8981,1.5287,1.3775,8.6707,2.1275,0.0257,3.6371,2.654,4.8806,0.7824,4.3539,5.2829,1.3457,4.736,2.8968,1.029,3.9699,4.131,0.0011,0.1866,1.6735,8.3983,1.0782,0.701,1.5291,0.2052,1.5472,0.537,1.1647,0.0293,3.3092,0.2525,0.059,2.8613,2.6383,3.0587,3.999,1.8155,3.5273,2.8447,0.0245,0.1413,2.4823,0.4256,1.4841,5.0932,1.5071,2.8072,0.2584,0.4089,0.0002,2.2094,5.2708,4.3727,0.1025,1.7517,0.235,0.3132,0.8204,3.2078,0.0005,3.9634,4.4795,2.09,2.5883,1.1761,6.6066,0.8857,5.398,1.4938,5.1874,5.7569,1.3279,2.6212,4.047,4.2311,4.7278,0.2015,0.6558,2.7206,1.7022,3.7692,5.3046,1.9977,1.5751,9.2715,0.0013,2.1851,1.3518,0.5742,4.2948,4.5375,1.3225,1.1119,6.501,3.6972,5.4286,4.2286,1.961,2.6078,1.3422,0.8136,0.0002,7.0212,0.3856,4.9901,4.7907,0.1347,5.2599,1.8785,1.4855,5.206,0.148,0.4044,1.139,2.552,0.0721,0.2597,0.0112,0.0004,0.007,1.2111,6.6452,4.2869,2.0854]}
{"id":535,"ended":true,"length":451,"text":"Everyone speaks in a different font. You've seen plenty of Times New Romans and Helveticas, but today you meet someone using a font you've never seen before. What's the name of that font?\n\nBobby Loves Fonts\n\nIn a large font community, everybody is a font aficionado. Every family, every style, every glyph, everything is represented in different fonts. I've been collecting fonts for a long time, and I can name a hundred different families, and maybe two hundred different styles.\n\nIt's my opinion that the use of different fonts makes things more interesting. You can 't even use only one type of font ( like Georgia Gothic ), that's why I chose Gotham.\n\nFonts on the Web\n\nOn the Web, you can see different ways to use fonts. There's no real definition between serif and sans-serif fonts, or in between serif fonts ( and sans-serif fonts ). It's a very individual choice.\n\nSome websites use only a few different fonts. But there are some websites where font sizes and styles vary wildly. So don 't be afraid to customize your website with the right fonts\n\nSo what are the right fonts? I'm not sure, but I can define some of the wrong ones. Don 't use comic sans. Don 't use Futura. Don 't use Courier. If you want to use one of those, use a slightly modified variant.\n\nSo what are good web fonts? Well, it all depends on your content. If your content is a blog post, stick to serif fonts. If your content is a text of a web page, take into account the structure of your page. If it's a text of a newsletter, stick to serif fonts. Use all fonts on the web, but don 't overdo it \u2026\n\nThe Right Fonts of the Right Size for the Right Purpose\n\nMost importantly, always use the right font for the right size! There is a right font size for almost every web page in the world. In general, it's a good idea to use small sizes on the sides, and small sizes on the top and the bottom. It makes your text legible, and you've got a chance to show your content with some style! Some fonts have different sizes, that's a good way to fit a certain font on a certain size.","token_len":498,"entropy":[9.332,2.957,2.1348,3.1385,9.0476,1.8524,3.4121,4.7168,3.6406,7.4637,0.1411,9.9677,0.972,13.9389,2.4852,8.0199,7.0879,0.9534,6.5199,1.7,0.7206,6.2201,1.9698,7.3334,5.8186,6.35,1.8037,5.051,3.152,1.2763,0.2712,1.9502,0.1912,0.4997,4.2883,1.7023,1.8154,5.0829,0.2187,1.3142,0.5879,0.3183,1.1706,0.0021,5.0957,4.1547,5.2502,6.3255,4.1409,0.3073,1.0959,0.0003,4.0446,3.1471,6.3253,2.4303,4.6023,0.6254,6.0731,1.8768,3.3592,1.9212,2.7987,0.0004,0.0007,0.3836,4.9124,6.6231,2.8548,2.1382,5.0126,1.036,0.5564,10.0494,1.75,4.8315,2.0781,3.7182,1.1725,4.5116,1.658,0.3619,3.6088,1.8973,2.3308,5.8048,1.091,0.9338,2.6017,1.0969,0.0221,0.853,0.7223,1.0517,3.566,5.9329,1.6349,3.3386,2.7598,5.008,2.1884,1.5536,6.5548,4.3678,2.0712,1.4543,2.7992,0.8011,2.5756,0.0001,3.8136,0.4683,4.7293,4.9854,0.2199,2.3278,5.6736,0.0237,2.9755,0.389,4.3149,4.0794,1.8012,3.7056,1.0166,3.3088,1.2893,8.1486,4.7035,6.731,3.0184,5.2534,0.8789,3.3788,1.5604,0.1861,4.8044,9.9312,9.1043,2.8964,3.1885,5.6462,1.077,2.8972,0.6897,3.7976,11.0946,2.2221,1.4877,0.0002,3.5564,0.7691,5.0189,1.1699,1.9772,0.7191,0.0002,5.6393,0.2558,1.4043,0.2571,2.0053,0.6478,2.4278,3.6864,4.6276,0.9295,1.7698,0.5494,0.7536,2.8602,1.6226,3.4463,4.4991,5.8215,7.5121,9.6419,0.0075,1.0742,0.8762,0.6375,0.0002,0.0,2.5724,0.8312,3.3054,4.8563,3.4415,2.8955,0.0014,2.9324,2.9735,4.92,1.3903,0.2619,0.132,0.001,0.4808,2.0372,3.2674,0.3296,2.7166,3.3743,5.887,2.7896,0.95,0.7811,0.0002,4.3433,4.1662,2.1217,3.8038,2.4935,1.4031,2.1349,0.3335,1.519,3.9192,2.4829,0.5638,2.7376,1.6891,3.4094,5.0899,2.6773,3.1445,3.2622,3.3884,3.1564,0.8399,3.7502,5.5113,10.118,0.0377,2.0548,2.503,0.3066,6.529,0.7645,2.9786,2.7339,3.1987,2.0745,0.3026,6.3228,0.0003,5.0448,1.7576,1.853,1.1105,6.3385,0.1074,0.9088,3.4447,2.434,1.5762,1.5044,2.0043,0.3388,1.055,3.0959,6.8126,2.6785,1.544,1.0854,6.8792,1.7002,0.8521,6.0031,2.9059,0.008,3.0112,9.9636,0.5187,2.7163,2.3137,0.7887,0.0111,0.1104,7.2698,0.2117,0.9003,0.3576,0.1587,0.0353,0.0809,5.6371,0.4866,4.833,0.2487,2.5097,0.5336,1.6473,4.0352,0.7516,0.9798,1.0399,2.8226,2.501,6.5458,5.8478,4.7263,2.0341,0.8583,0.0002,3.8069,1.4621,1.522,7.1845,5.7363,0.17,0.3603,2.3977,0.2652,3.4425,3.1625,0.3358,0.3052,1.7193,6.6308,1.0724,2.6034,2.9819,1.9886,0.6241,2.5375,4.6315,0.688,0.5203,10.3125,0.9408,7.4436,0.0007,0.8508,0.7391,0.4746,0.4601,0.1167,0.0929,0.468,4.2513,7.0867,1.5061,4.1399,1.4198,0.2002,5.87,6.3097,0.4066,1.4531,7.0151,0.2688,1.5135,2.1596,0.5173,1.5952,2.9556,0.2469,0.5912,2.9417,0.6941,0.4702,7.261,0.3213,1.8601,0.1174,1.4158,0.002,0.1591,0.0904,5.8027,5.1119,2.4724,3.2307,1.0063,0.9821,2.2738,2.2874,2.0174,2.8162,0.0032,4.7455,2.0667,0.6109,9.1472,1.4356,0.0003,3.4928,5.2371,0.8291,0.7913,5.638,1.3857,3.7317,4.2454,4.2032,3.2388,2.2619,4.8688,0.0934,0.0002,5.0353,5.3956,0.1777,6.0727,1.4825,0.7698,0.4234,0.9156,0.9669,0.7747,0.6208,5.8874,4.8441,4.2294,2.0433,2.1023,6.2997,0.3856,3.9016,1.0413,5.1316,1.4836,2.2895,0.5216,3.8801,0.2668,0.1047,0.5714,4.3353,4.102,0.1234,2.6656,0.6949,2.3031,1.0992,0.3987,0.0901,1.1845,6.1505,3.794,3.7641,1.2839,8.8218,1.8659,1.7911,2.878,0.168,0.1569,0.048,1.6058,3.3041,5.1193,1.1158,0.5207,3.6214,3.2314,2.2549,4.3089,6.9395,0.0445,1.1731,1.0816,3.4103,5.1753,1.048,1.1461,4.9626,0.0896,3.4138,1.5576,4.4805,2.654,4.3186,3.6478,3.735,6.1264,1.855,2.2992,3.289,2.607,1.3428,5.9058,0.9119,3.2915,0.8316,3.0646,0.0877,4.8743,2.916,2.9223,3.1479,2.967,2.2304,2.8221,4.3116,0.7649]}
{"id":325,"ended":false,"length":463,"text":"DC Comics introduces its newest superhero. This character was seemingly created for the sole purpose of offending as many readers as possible.\n\nThe character is a gender bent version of Wonder Woman, a strong feminist icon. Her name is Gynnia, and while she has no superpowers (except for having the ability to speak through \"foul tongue\"), she is more than capable of kicking ass. She comes with a pet monkey named Monkey Man.\n\nNot surprisingly, she has received numerous complaints.\n\nWonder Woman has received a number of negative reactions from readers of the comic due to her appearance. From misogynistic slurs to hate mail, the comic book industry is showing that it is not immune to the bigotry of its customers. But don't just take it from us, you can see for yourself.\n\n\"I just think she's a joke.... And the picture they drew of her looked like a man in the first place and that is unacceptable in my book. How do they even have a comic about her. They must be so ignorant to that fact that women are stronger than men..... I know that for a fact.\"\n\nThis one comment sums up exactly what is wrong with how comic books view women.\n\n\"I just want them to stop writing female characters in comic books I mean... The main character of a comic book is the main character. And the main character is a male.. And I don't understand why they want to write about female characters I just don't understand... And... I don't like this character\"\n\nYou're not alone...\n\n\"She looks like a man. It's disgusting\"\n\n\"She has a beard.\"\n\n\"It's obvious she is a man... It's not even funny that it's this obvious\"\n\n\"She looks like a cross between Wonder Woman and the Penguin\"\n\n\"It's like they're making fun of men.\"\n\n\"It's ridiculous to call this a woman...\"\n\n\"This just isn't funny.

{"id":3540,"ended":false,"length":463,"text":"DC Comics introduces its newest superhero. This character was seemingly created for the sole purpose of offending as many readers as possible.\n\nThe character is a gender bent version of Wonder Woman, a strong feminist icon. Her name is Gynnia, and while she has no superpowers (except for having the ability to speak through \"foul tongue\"), she is more than capable of kicking ass. She comes with a pet monkey named Monkey Man.\n\nNot surprisingly, she has received numerous complaints.\n\nWonder Woman has received a number of negative reactions from readers of the comic due to her appearance. From misogynistic slurs to hate mail, the comic book industry is showing that it is not immune to the bigotry of its customers. But don't just take it from us, you can see for yourself.\n\n\"I just think she's a joke.... And the picture they drew of her looked like a man in the first place and that is unacceptable in my book. How do they even have a comic about her. They must be so ignorant to that fact that women are stronger than men..... I know that for a fact.\"\n\nThis one comment sums up exactly what is wrong with how comic books view women.\n\n\"I just want them to stop writing female characters in comic books I mean... The main character of a comic book is the main character. And the main character is a male.. And I don't understand why they want to write about female characters I just don't understand... And... I don't like this character\"\n\nYou're not alone...\n\n\"She looks like a man. It's disgusting\"\n\n\"She has a beard.\"\n\n\"It's obvious she is a man...

{"id":483,"ended":true,"length":465,"text":"A boy and his grandfather in rural New England watch Sputnik fly overhead in the autumn of 1957.\n\nThe launch of Sputnik I on October 4, 1957 was one of the most important events of the 20th Century. Many of the events of the time have been the subject of countless books and television shows, but none tell the true story of the day so clearly as this classic movie.\n\nIn 1957, Sputnik was the single most important thing in our lives. Even today, if you mention that you watched Sputnik fly by, you get a reaction. Children of the '80s grew up on The Sound of Music but had no memory of it except for one line: \"Sputnik. Sputnik. Take your seat, take your seat.\"\n\nI've often wondered what the adults of the era who didn't know anything about it were thinking as that black and white image of the red, white, and blue orb filled all of their view. The movie shows how important it was by showing the reaction of a small boy, Alan Shepard, when he sees it. Then, it takes the viewer up on a ride through our history and lets me know exactly what I missed.\n\nKorea was happening in real life, but Sputnik was happening in the background. If it weren't for Sputnik, you wouldn't know there was a war going on until after your dad got home from work and could tell you about it. You wouldn't know that the Soviets were the bad guys until that news came on TV. You wouldn't be afraid or confused until the American flag on the space shuttle broke the glass and started to take off.\n\nI was born in 1980, but most of this isn't so surprising to me. When I was a kid, we would always see the space shuttle flying. When I was 12, I even worked with someone who was working for the shuttle program.\n\nWhen I was 17, Sputnik was no longer my everyday life. I wasn't even sure that NASA existed in the same form that it once did.\n\nA little less than five years later, I remember seeing the first landing of the space shuttle on November 9, 1981 and thinking, \"Wow, that was cool. But it's been 30 years.\" The movie didn't make me see a moon landing or a Mars mission, but it did make me remember how important space is.","token_len":499,"entropy":[9.2143,3.455,0.9339,4.9033,4.3856,5.403,5.079,3.3851,5.0521,11.1848,4.3663,0.0037,4.1756,3.929,2.3607,2.3449,5.6853,1.4707,2.971,0.5052,2.0321,0.0008,1.8899,5.887,1.2092,0.2323,0.0002,0.0005,6.0213,3.2505,2.9558,3.0058,0.3337,0.3465,1.91,3.2615,0.0258,0.4069,1.1021,1.77,1.9485,1.3256,0.3044,2.6027,0.0311,3.0411,0.6396,5.6952,2.0227,0.4942,6.0813,2.2379,0.7776,4.3397,3.9161,0.6567,4.659,1.483,0.0041,3.8697,1.1425,1.08,5.0156,2.0954,1.1716,1.782,3.7138,9.4547,0.4741,3.9822,0.0833,0.1861,1.3327,5.7867,7.1074,3.3678,1.1142,1.8075,5.6839,4.844,1.0391,0.8764,0.0002,2.9754,3.5166,0.3751,1.8727,0.0005,0.0006,1.358,2.1109,6.2988,0.7555,0.7169,4.9348,1.6354,3.76,3.2845,0.5578,5.5651,2.4586,0.2541,5.3092,0.9627,6.9484,3.3194,3.4907,2.0812,1.1288,0.002,0.0011,8.269,3.4702,1.0779,0.9078,4.5091,1.3409,5.8241,1.2597,7.613,4.0165,1.2047,3.9399,3.265,0.0307,6.4488,0.0144,3.1973,6.6924,7.6871,0.0589,0.257,6.3698,4.4745,1.0666,4.6483,0.0748,2.9429,6.0785,1.258,3.0974,5.5936,1.4559,0.3205,5.0688,1.8685,0.0016,4.684,2.9215,0.0186,0.0062,0.9642,7.092,2.6633,5.61,1.9784,4.4673,0.3593,0.8271,1.1266,0.9246,0.0002,3.8975,3.5382,4.1859,1.1694,1.5077,2.0963,7.4042,1.46,0.9626,4.1803,6.1651,3.9604,0.0002,2.2336,2.1107,0.0966,3.1232,2.4274,0.5884,5.4983,5.7626,8.2755,2.4616,0.0689,2.3629,1.0822,1.8196,5.3991,2.9145,0.7373,1.4824,0.5675,0.069,6.142,7.6319,5.1434,1.6415,2.7819,6.8779,2.4079,3.0323,3.6473,4.6318,2.9106,4.6792,1.2628,0.1579,6.935,1.2726,1.8055,7.2214,0.7199,2.8757,3.2231,3.5757,2.3411,6.6356,4.5573,0.3101,3.3279,0.7527,3.0823,3.9004,1.0508,5.659,1.3472,3.9712,4.3684,2.5938,2.6107,5.0866,3.5652,2.3371,7.445,2.0284,5.6754,4.1301,1.6675,5.68,6.9752,2.6126,4.2402,0.5772,3.2133,2.6258,0.6677,0.4141,0.0002,6.7256,6.8886,2.2006,9.911,2.2875,5.4397,2.8996,2.0789,1.9785,3.4438,0.002,0.0012,0.8725,3.9403,0.6897,1.6061,4.8732,0.3218,4.9787,3.3951,2.9816,0.001,0.2417,2.6076,0.0042,0.0017,0.7645,4.0896,1.3689,0.0008,2.1786,4.8515,0.6584,0.6692,2.6006,1.5717,0.0108,5.7932,2.5479,6.6146,5.3133,3.2967,2.2995,1.1504,1.5318,1.7801,6.7393,3.9896,0.8502,2.3819,0.2874,0.4371,3.9495,2.2034,0.0003,0.7865,1.9907,1.8498,4.2117,0.6754,5.9945,4.9448,0.0724,1.661,4.8505,5.7192,1.6313,4.149,1.6906,0.5347,3.2404,1.055,0.0001,3.9703,7.102,5.3104,4.3148,2.5441,1.9226,5.9602,4.9654,6.3747,0.8373,7.096,0.9242,4.8432,2.2554,4.714,2.0098,4.5549,1.7951,6.2065,0.7051,0.3757,0.5619,0.0002,2.9416,2.8004,3.2563,0.6433,5.8513,1.5248,2.1493,6.7153,0.4502,5.4049,6.1781,0.0005,4.0843,3.2449,3.1365,0.8412,0.3963,3.593,0.4564,0.317,1.3739,0.5633,0.3725,3.2353,3.0556,3.4405,3.0109,1.579,4.5549,0.3782,3.4811,4.2538,3.6495,0.5806,0.2036,3.8621,0.6159,0.687,5.6605,6.5366,2.7062,5.7389,0.8794,1.57,3.1143,2.2156,0.8699,6.5556,2.2544,0.9157,2.6013,0.0002,3.2078,0.3773,0.2416,3.1432,0.1882,5.7376,0.0035,0.0015,0.9243,6.5963,0.2449,3.4816,6.49,3.1269,0.3083,1.0945,4.7039,0.0002,1.9309,1.9726,2.7757,5.4328,5.275,3.7973,0.5161,4.6686,5.9637,2.3833,0.9823,4.2439,3.9777,0.3344,2.4705,0.0001,4.354,3.2533,4.4068,0.1293,2.9494,0.1099,0.7086,0.0674,1.1715,3.9793,3.2102,1.5727,2.5678,7.1845,0.4285,1.8216,2.3031,0.0979,2.0675,5.6615,2.6633,0.1233,4.2719,4.3525,2.9305,1.1383,0.3909,1.4606,0.5693,1.3384,1.6783,3.6084,1.6734,3.8519,2.5785,1.6876,4.0009,4.4132,0.055,2.3734,3.9795,3.6532,4.0246,0.0003,2.7853,1.6381,5.1878,3.4976,4.9194,0.5515,2.6699,1.1544,3.741,3.2772,2.0412,0.5064,0.7467,1.1945,1.5474,0.1059,2.7208,2.4997,1.1935,3.8234,3.2175,1.5834]}
{"id":749,"ended":true,"length":456,"text":"Long Forgotten, the final book in the Unusual Suspects series by Sara Paretsky.\n\nIn a small Louisiana community, the killer is at large, and no-one, not even the police, wants to believe there are serial killers in their midst. Detective Lisa Hunter begins her investigation against the backdrop of a family torn apart by murders, and she begins to wonder if she will be the one to bring an end and help put them once and for all behind bars...\n\nI have always loved Sara's writing. To me she has always been that good old fashioned writer who keeps everything interesting and never goes on to read to page 20 then be like 'oh i think i'll do a page of something else here' then never bothers to go back to that page, but I digress... :)\n\nI felt like Long Forgotten was a good addition to the Unusual Suspects series, although I must admit that I was a bit disappointed with this book. As always, Sara had some great details in this book and I love that about her books. All the small details have always been what make her books stand out.\n\nHowever, for me I feel like I have read all the same type of storyline before. If it wasn't for the fact that I had read Long Forgotten as being a standalone novel I probably would of known that it was just one of Sara's many of the same storyline. My only gripe was the fact that I felt that the storyline was getting a bit repetitive by the end.\n\nThat being said, I still recommend this book to everyone. It's a good book, although not as exciting as the first few books in this series. I will probably pick up another book from this series as there are others I have not yet read.\n\nOverall - Good book, but just another book for the series\n\n3.25 stars\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

{"id":1453,"ended":true,"length":471,"text":"You are shown a short clip of yourself on this date 5 years into the future, and you note that Future You is overwhelming rich. You have no idea how you came into all this wealth, until you suddenly spot a small detail in the video...\n\nThe future is a place that can be very odd, so I suppose it's not the biggest surprise that it's possible for a small detail to make you quite wealthy...\n\nHow?\n\nA single year later, on this date of the next day, you are shown a video again, and this time, you are shown Future You standing at a large table filled with...\n\nNothing but money and bills.\n\nThe money is so vast, and the bills are so many, that the table overflows with bills, the pile of money looks like it came from a massive robbery, and to cap off this already startling discovery, you see...\n\nEvery single bill is for the amount you thought you were going to get in the first video, but never did, or the money is for that amount in addition to the amount you were really going to get, so in the future, you are indeed very wealthy.\n\nSo how is this possible?\n\nWe have no idea, but I suppose that in the future you simply figured the probability of getting every single one of the bills you were shown.\n\nThat's possible, as long as you can add up the odds of all of the bills.\n\nYou do this, because you figure that each bill being for its value in the present moment, and being replaced with its value five years from now, is just very likely, which means you have to add up both the odds of each bill and the odds of them adding up.\n\nYou do that, and the probability of each and every bill in your pile of bills being worth double its value five years from now becomes two times as likely to be the case than being zero, so as long as you can add up the odds, you're done.\n\nOf course, this can never actually be measured in terms of odds, it's just that the probability of you showing

It turns out we were forgetting them for a very good reason.\n\nThe most interesting part of sleep appears to be dreaming, so we've decided to test the invention of a device that makes dreams a reality. This is the first time, the world is waking up in the middle of a dream. Let us discover what happens when someone begins to dream while sleeping.\n\nIn a small town in Canada, people from the past woke up in the middle of a dream. The people that appeared in the dream had one job: to guide the present day protagonist to his destination. This is the dream of a man that had had the most awful and most interesting dream in his life.\n\nThe people that appeared in the dream were ordinary people, but they were extremely powerful. Some were a superhero and a beautiful woman who was also a magician. The dream seemed to be the result of a very vivid memory, and the protagonist was even able to recall their full names.\n\nHe was very surprised by the event and decided to call the people that had appeared in his dream, to understand more about the origins of the dream. His call was responded by a girl who took his phone and answered. The girl looked strange: in her eyes I could see something similar to their memories, but in reality it was far from the truth.\n\nOnce she learned that the protagonist was investigating her and her brother \u2019 s presence in this dream, she explained what had happened in the beginning. The dream was the result of a genetic procedure, during which they were modified to be able to live in this world. In the beginning they were able to live and communicate in the dream, but this was not enough to keep them alive in this world. So, when their host left the dream, they were sent to the real world to die.\n\nThe girl decided that she wanted to give her brother another chance for life, so it was decided to test this experiment. His brother was the protagonist in his nightmare, and so he could not escape from his dream in the same way that the others couldn\u2019t.\n\nThe girl told him what she wanted to test, and the protagonist agreed to it. It\u2019s time to leave the house and return to reality. This time he got stuck in the dream at the level of a sleeping person. He woke up and left the house to the sound of someone crying.","token_len":502,"entropy":[6.4137,8.267,4.8076,4.8606,0.2668,8.3695,2.3553,5.4997,3.0162,7.8314,1.7602,0.9693,2.8308,4.8634,2.5882,5.0451,4.8952,6.4851,3.5383,4.0999,1.7947,2.3626,3.0078,0.017,0.591,0.8779,0.0005,2.293,5.3091,3.8892,1.9588,0.685,7.5524,7.3173,0.2857,0.2057,7.1639,2.3313,4.473,2.2593,3.1578,3.739,0.1338,3.9885,2.5608,5.51,4.5648,1.1125,3.3222,0.4454,3.7037,3.6882,2.7072,2.2617,0.4072,2.6448,1.8088,2.5421,2.4946,1.4181,5.0219,3.7973,5.8981,2.2559,2.8289,0.1065,2.8558,1.7924,2.2866,0.0062,1.4376,1.1395,1.0378,6.8147,3.2026,6.6585,2.0871,2.2413,0.6216,4.565,5.6594,0.7326,0.5307,4.1934,2.4123,0.3929,0.2855,0.0002,3.5714,2.0655,4.7575,6.0565,0.8967,5.2699,0.23,3.0058,6.0317,1.8581,5.7822,5.5313,0.0997,1.6321,0.6454,0.0889,0.0047,0.8022,0.4616,1.0963,1.8684,2.4033,4.1465,6.9924,1.5952,0.3568,1.5975,2.5778,6.1631,5.8019,1.5259,1.3038,6.5141,0.9137,6.8194,1.5412,10.1506,1.6671,1.7653,2.6627,0.3208,3.2307,2.2514,1.9927,1.5841,1.4934,1.4385,2.9746,3.1661,3.344,6.0418,3.4322,4.5759,7.7768,4.9943,3.8865,6.3963,2.4835,2.2845,0.3069,0.2329,0.5663,1.2502,0.0002,1.4413,4.3659,1.2503,0.5697,0.4173,0.1815,0.0469,1.4687,6.0021,0.495,1.5324,1.6826,1.1516,0.8906,5.1149,3.4379,0.7932,5.2052,2.3949,4.9996,6.9887,2.6612,2.8789,7.1628,1.0921,2.9338,2.1776,4.2329,1.1393,5.4363,0.3994,2.081,2.1039,4.699,0.4931,1.2289,3.133,2.9693,0.0056,1.6583,3.7815,6.3178,2.9307,1.9937,1.7095,1.5798,4.3276,1.673,6.023,0.4428,0.0012,2.3834,4.5612,6.5296,0.6398,0.8612,0.6529,0.0001,5.87,1.7671,3.6214,3.5112,2.164,0.9533,5.2293,2.1,2.8513,0.1557,5.0805,1.4167,2.935,1.123,3.9116,1.0112,0.5913,1.7584,0.1148,2.7211,2.4097,6.6825,4.9572,0.2264,1.4081,6.6319,0.139,1.0179,0.3471,0.6478,5.0192,6.8199,1.3942,8.5571,1.5229,1.2125,4.4426,1.2468,5.0753,1.8348,3.5379,0.9605,4.5748,3.6912,2.044,1.1866,4.4478,6.3555,5.4798,4.9859,1.0944,2.1657,6.5721,2.2649,0.7578,4.747,5.0632,0.2895,6.6677,4.3067,1.6805,0.8053,2.6063,1.7672,2.3152,0.3053,5.0026,1.4024,1.9437,2.4671,0.1489,0.5475,0.0002,5.474,2.1921,5.718,1.6346,0.9501,2.6613,0.8615,8.7619,3.8244,5.0298,2.6313,4.9864,14.6731,6.2903,8.8005,7.2593,1.2634,3.3625,0.3029,1.0771,0.7493,6.1714,3.2895,1.8904,0.1358,2.9867,0.7454,5.8755,1.1088,2.0446,2.4148,1.4367,3.9517,1.1312,0.0042,0.9188,8.5613,6.576,2.0796,6.8225,0.1015,4.9355,1.1991,6.0267,0.5914,2.1387,1.0322,0.0045,3.6228,1.1728,2.8174,1.1417,0.6198,3.5114,1.4544,2.6402,2.3655,0.9071,2.7831,0.0063,3.0868,4.0952,4.9766,2.1085,2.0421,2.0609,0.9156,0.2973,4.4408,1.6902,1.9943,1.8658,1.048,3.2472,0.3694,1.8761,2.2775,0.9662,0.4266,0.1824,3.7449,1.7568,3.2496,3.3077,7.3321,5.8091,1.515,0.9607,0.5646,0.8151,1.3163,3.565,0.9283,1.2824,5.1165,0.0538,2.0687,3.2378,0.6261,0.4283,0.0001,1.4666,2.9449,5.1792,1.5701,1.2465,1.5284,0.1016,4.419,2.1898,2.2706,4.741,0.2493,4.5911,1.2385,1.1615,1.5152,5.6691,0.4782,0.9951,0.4995,5.7271,2.061,4.4322,0.7471,7.467,4.1949,1.4564,3.3943,3.1867,2.6858,2.9112,5.7878,0.8873,0.9568,3.2481,0.888,4.2442,2.979,4.537,1.7701,1.425,1.7383,3.8066,1.0694,2.6757,0.0728,1.1594,2.2629,3.9044,7.0245,7.8416,1.2896,4.0789,0.3977,1.4536,0.0001,1.3923,1.8473,3.7149,0.9196,4.2975,1.8297,2.2794,0.7552,4.2081,0.891,0.6699,2.2733,1.436,3.8016,0.7997,1.8492,0.2614,3.8269,15.0889,0.2431,0.8027,5.6274,0.4513,4.3046,1.0319,4.8794,1.1409,2.6203,0.2404,4.269,0.3445,3.8793,2.2983,2.0585,5.2505,4.6189,0.4563,1.115,0.9543,6.1105,0.9017,7.9814,0.3743,1.3536,6.6749,0.8752,0.7488,2.0689,3.926,0.0225,2.2721,5.9241,0.7269,0.959,2.681,5.1807,6.1054,0.0479,4.3263,3.0824,0.6334]}
{"id":3974,"ended":true,"length":487,"text":"Write a Superhero story. In one week ( 1\/30 ), I 'll turn the top comment with the highest score into a comic!\n\nThe contest is organized by me.\n\nTo enter, just write an original, funny and\/or touching, comic ( a word that can also have other definitions, like \"funny page \") about any superhero ( except Superman, of course. He is the greatest ). The superhero universe has existed for a long time, but there, in the past, when our planet was young, there was nothing and no one. And there was one simple reason for that : we didn't have science. One day, when our planet was big enough to have civilization, there came men, but they only discovered science as they progressed. They only learned to live as men and to survive : to build cities, to create a civilization and much more.\n\nBut our world is not perfect : the men ( and women ) in our world have many enemies that they may have faced, even in their childhood. Some of them are natural, like the wind and the sun, but other threats were only invented for the same and to teach our ancestors. There is always the human being as a protagonist. He ( usually ) faces the threats that he will face, and as long as he can ( which is usually a very long time ), he always manages to save the world. And one day ( probably a long time after him ), the man 'll disappear, and there will only be the earth. And maybe another man ( usually a little bit different that the first ) will then face the threats the next time.\n\nThat would be the beginning of the comic : \" There, was once a man who was born on our planet, but he was different. He was a man of science.\"\n\nOf course, we would also see the villains, but I like the idea that the superheroes would be the focus of the story for the first page.\n\nWhen I'll be able to start working on it, I'll ask you to draw it ( if you are a professional ), or write it as a story. Also if you're a newcomer to comicbooks, remember that the most important characters are the ones that appear in more than 1 comic, and the biggest villains are the ones that appear in 1 comic but fight dozens of times and have different motives and personalities. So, don't be scared to write or draw something completely different.","token_len":502,"entropy":[4.0641,7.9223,4.4379,3.6625,2.7994,4.7298,4.1732,5.1822,4.6409,10.996,2.8115,3.937,3.0246,2.0788,9.209,3.0176,6.5806,2.5181,7.6359,11.5986,4.9763,1.9274,3.3812,2.1587,2.1303,0.675,5.1229,3.9014,1.4241,0.1968,3.9314,7.3949,1.4488,6.4899,0.3145,5.0768,2.1088,2.2878,0.0003,4.2594,1.6583,0.6737,2.9732,3.9433,3.4791,4.3784,3.3637,4.0609,3.2097,3.4483,0.002,5.2108,5.157,4.1979,3.7185,7.3002,3.9138,4.4117,3.1482,4.1663,4.5979,4.5252,5.2175,2.0639,1.9241,0.8948,4.3579,0.2618,7.6468,4.9944,3.6341,4.1551,4.8905,2.9453,3.6731,7.6494,4.1392,2.1396,4.4065,0.0723,3.5942,5.6738,3.0575,2.367,4.937,6.1778,3.1666,8.472,9.9973,2.6482,4.3108,0.8052,2.1664,0.9727,0.0858,0.9915,1.7207,3.1072,6.9567,2.8381,1.303,3.706,0.6826,5.3794,5.865,6.0958,0.6346,7.4135,0.5767,2.1588,0.9231,3.2773,4.9948,2.1308,2.9762,1.2776,3.6163,3.039,1.6261,4.7563,6.7302,4.2275,1.2193,1.3082,6.532,3.1509,3.1752,0.0015,0.7266,7.6674,1.6278,5.8027,1.5461,0.4972,2.9505,2.9757,1.6554,0.3557,5.8351,0.2259,1.3782,3.0111,6.999,0.4551,2.3033,3.0309,7.5795,2.2109,5.7472,1.3108,5.0429,6.2316,4.422,4.3665,2.4304,4.8207,0.7364,2.283,4.5454,2.6025,2.1225,4.1826,4.0173,3.4791,2.3813,2.6311,3.7095,7.2508,3.4294,4.3217,4.0741,0.7769,0.8559,3.6638,4.1728,2.3509,2.9977,7.1674,0.2945,0.4939,2.224,0.0005,4.4388,5.2929,2.8548,1.5911,2.0219,3.9005,3.4403,3.0189,5.3239,5.2999,3.4703,0.7772,0.3457,3.7998,1.4382,1.7633,2.2627,3.9587,5.5598,3.5015,2.6153,4.4867,2.5913,4.5427,1.7469,4.3471,2.9335,1.4514,5.022,1.0284,3.465,1.1336,0.6132,1.2823,8.1882,2.5557,2.6002,1.729,6.9888,2.7653,1.1541,1.6625,1.208,2.0544,4.5718,6.5481,5.1135,5.8285,4.032,3.3832,1.8341,6.1955,7.3409,3.66,7.1461,3.7985,4.9368,2.4147,4.32,1.7314,3.8409,2.9124,6.1283,4.6052,5.0166,1.355,7.2381,2.0033,4.7754,5.7488,7.3948,1.5558,5.2447,1.9477,4.7735,2.2436,2.4066,3.5577,0.1313,1.8129,1.5024,4.6547,2.7098,0.0104,0.6155,2.7377,5.4008,5.6262,1.2605,3.5174,2.6979,2.2279,1.0625,0.2852,2.5528,0.4594,4.657,5.2406,0.0768,4.3248,1.5296,0.7409,0.8251,2.7219,5.3827,0.9046,2.5964,4.7937,3.3476,3.1621,0.0729,5.4485,6.668,1.9037,2.3129,3.3475,7.4495,7.2392,8.1361,2.1683,1.2898,3.3308,1.2906,5.24,0.0945,3.4531,5.4638,2.2582,2.2906,5.3939,4.8072,2.4141,1.716,3.2679,2.1569,3.9465,2.4578,4.3212,7.1334,1.8631,3.5492,2.9243,0.9698,6.3677,5.9915,0.9678,2.8712,4.6832,3.743,1.3617,1.9024,1.0071,0.0004,4.3477,4.6646,0.6052,1.36,4.5294,0.209,1.0962,3.8472,3.8526,3.9571,6.4104,4.8107,6.4927,3.1566,0.6934,1.1693,1.6872,2.4254,3.6552,3.929,3.5964,0.2807,1.065,2.0735,1.6317,1.7394,6.6909,1.8483,1.2493,1.3839,1.5418,1.447,1.4377,3.0783,5.0089,0.8619,0.0004,5.4456,0.1474,0.5305,2.9084,3.9541,3.5145,3.9057,1.9959,7.4615,2.5954,2.6326,3.5394,4.3904,1.6015,2.1619,1.5761,2.0501,5.5914,3.0011,1.6452,3.1119,6.0854,0.6287,0.5397,1.2727,5.5205,0.9842,2.7023,5.8957,1.0115,1.3534,0.0004,5.0974,1.6573,7.7143,2.2455,2.9227,0.0316,4.6712,3.7058,0.1755,3.0453,0.5702,0.5133,0.6542,4.2126,2.4841,1.3916,5.4712,3.0578,3.8726,4.0207,0.3783,3.1698,2.7025,5.021,5.2545,3.4304,3.5255,1.391,3.3579,0.672,2.8046,1.6527,5.597,3.7205,0.2145,2.6506,1.2224,6.5863,1.202,2.1634,6.266,0.5461,6.8518,0.8464,2.8223,5.0187,1.1851,5.6598,1.3293,1.3712,0.8379,1.2582,6.2894,0.7327,5.9585,0.4331,3.4465,1.5982,2.3578,1.1124,2.3683,5.005,3.2026,0.5441,0.6742,0.127,0.4718,1.623,0.5151,4.0391,0.5486,5.0596,8.3579,9.6484,0.4676,0.6906,3.351,2.6454,4.6032,5.4126,2.5039,2.5469,0.4266,3.0226,1.8797,4.3908,0.0042,2.3975,3.093,1.5215,2.7494,5.884,0.75,2.9882,5.3616,0.8323,1.7792]}

singer by the name of Joe Stampley, and was featured on his \"A New Way To Pay\" album.\n\nIn the late 1930's and 1940's the song was recorded by Roy Acuff, and featured on his \"Joe Stampley Recordings\" album.\n\nIn the early 1950's it was recorded by Johnny Horton on two separate occasions, one of which was by the country music icon himself.\n\nIn 1965 it was recorded by The Osborne Brothers on their \"Greetings From Nashville\" album.\n\nOne of the most recent recordings of the song was by a Nashville-based trio named \"The Lonesome Family Band\" on their album \"You Can't Get It At The Grocery Store\" in 2010.\n\nIn 2012, I was introduced to the song by a friend in my church who was a member of the original version of the band and had performed the song with the original group, singing in the trio.\n\nOn one of my \"listenings\" while driving in my car I heard the refrain \"My father's gone\" and before it ended my heart jumped at the realization that that was the song that I'd been searching for after 7 decades!\n\nIn this day when songs are recorded by other artists and appear on different albums, the song was still included on the \"Greetings From Nashville\" album.\n\nThere were 5 other songs that I already recorded of Johnny Horton's, and in order to put this on my website I needed a copy of this song from the Osborne Brothers to put on the website.\n\nOn my search for the record, I noticed that the song was also available as a single of its own, which is what I am now sharing with you today.\n\nTo be honest, when my wife heard the song for the first time she said that in the song it sounded like Johnny was singing to her, and it made her cry to hear her voice in the song.\n\nI am sharing it with you, and I hope that you enjoy it as much as I did.\n\nThank you,\n\nBilly Joe\n\nThis song is by a country music artist by the name of Joe Stampley and is featured on his self titled \"Joe Stampley\" album.","token_len":503,"entropy":[7.6425,7.3337,6.6744,6.1173,3.1908,7.877,3.5733,2.3485,0.683,2.0887,0.0247,1.8779,1.9069,0.0078,3.0707,3.1644,1.5415,2.982,4.3568,4.9528,1.4893,5.8328,2.3693,1.2381,0.0002,4.1341,1.5548,4.5551,4.3514,1.725,1.2918,2.0996,2.7568,0.7004,3.2048,1.5878,3.053,6.8033,1.1604,6.0049,0.9519,0.2106,0.1387,4.6023,4.3971,9.2497,2.554,1.7439,1.4929,2.0954,3.454,0.5763,2.6217,3.2478,4.3745,3.5578,4.2448,2.7273,7.5268,1.7445,1.1161,0.3354,1.0835,0.0002,2.2238,1.4697,1.7921,2.3717,0.195,2.7142,1.2057,0.0445,2.8435,0.2237,0.2901,1.5217,0.2534,6.2281,7.6186,0.8893,0.9598,1.0725,2.1139,0.3645,0.7279,0.2183,7.4447,1.0434,0.2671,0.0103,7.6608,0.3652,0.8012,0.5357,0.1834,0.2039,0.0002,0.7535,0.4484,2.028,0.5294,0.0647,4.2967,0.1193,1.2305,0.1111,4.7891,7.9031,3.7041,5.8696,3.1992,2.0928,1.0489,3.4293,2.1568,0.2105,0.4194,4.1043,2.0707,7.1752,3.7071,3.2685,6.2942,1.183,0.4529,0.0002,0.8485,4.9406,1.9122,0.0428,0.5249,0.1435,4.9635,10.7635,0.4194,1.4361,1.6636,1.6244,4.8813,4.5409,1.1631,5.9096,1.105,0.64,0.3683,0.287,0.0002,5.9251,0.4685,0.2229,1.859,5.7069,2.3808,1.3937,0.4384,0.1329,0.7587,2.0862,3.6871,5.5389,3.4419,0.2089,4.7333,3.1684,2.5802,1.6278,5.9327,2.7314,0.0041,5.2289,2.5134,1.6123,2.361,0.8217,2.8992,0.6842,5.766,2.5883,0.5121,2.4344,2.7526,6.6935,2.4932,6.7338,2.2796,0.1738,2.0855,0.9843,5.2832,0.1337,0.3544,0.0002,1.5668,4.0234,0.9728,5.8188,2.6516,4.3671,0.0632,1.1992,1.1482,0.9531,1.9847,1.9596,3.8307,3.1025,6.3364,3.811,2.0236,2.203,2.3261,0.0382,0.5274,5.4173,6.1124,0.5423,0.3871,3.5544,2.783,2.9319,4.7905,1.8677,0.2776,2.5395,2.3355,2.6296,4.5621,3.3099,6.5518,3.614,1.2546,10.4976,2.7233,1.0067,0.0003,4.7118,4.1804,0.7285,1.4898,5.1717,7.1196,1.9454,3.7599,0.3558,5.9425,4.0949,3.1457,3.3693,1.3765,2.471,1.3089,1.2538,5.6493,0.9243,3.3041,2.4717,0.8548,0.2931,2.094,1.2159,6.2087,5.0618,4.0859,4.1289,2.5581,4.0557,2.8912,0.1167,3.8569,0.4231,3.8636,1.3757,1.2316,1.1298,1.7871,1.6855,2.6255,1.3146,1.9503,0.0292,6.2401,4.9619,1.2083,3.4511,0.4835,0.0002,3.3429,3.8977,4.6558,9.1528,6.9395,1.1414,2.3045,2.7918,4.511,2.5511,1.9975,7.4381,0.5358,6.021,1.1527,0.8603,2.1937,2.2593,3.6837,5.0376,5.3999,0.9314,1.2219,3.4193,3.3141,0.1025,0.1072,0.031,0.0536,0.3131,0.8249,0.3316,0.0002,4.1772,2.4725,5.8562,4.7413,0.93,2.2034,1.8334,6.7262,4.5813,5.5613,5.9881,0.0871,1.4744,3.2505,2.0161,4.0028,4.4149,0.2277,4.1107,2.9597,3.2401,1.9792,4.6703,1.4776,3.1768,2.7075,2.8569,0.1563,2.8824,0.3396,3.6108,1.4133,8.7502,0.0507,3.9734,2.1254,0.9376,1.758,1.4702,0.4507,0.6755,0.0002,4.6966,2.3404,4.9292,1.1099,1.2268,5.5789,1.8183,0.23,5.5232,0.7703,1.5951,2.1124,1.2646,3.8929,2.9155,2.2889,0.4993,3.4844,6.2355,3.6768,0.6155,1.992,2.4872,1.916,2.6502,0.5792,5.5628,2.9902,5.4805,1.2127,0.1147,2.7002,0.3006,0.2672,0.0002,4.2161,3.7454,0.7766,0.5852,3.584,4.4085,3.036,2.9955,1.007,0.4394,4.0131,0.0884,0.0135,0.0004,1.807,3.6721,2.5758,5.8207,1.7723,2.6508,2.1872,1.2002,0.7368,3.3981,4.8786,1.3384,3.3153,0.9225,2.0859,1.3803,3.3067,3.3086,0.8671,3.7549,5.2866,3.5307,2.8522,3.4545,3.0021,0.8937,0.7457,0.4852,0.3777,0.0002,2.0955,3.6356,4.9932,2.8159,1.0321,0.1103,3.8593,2.621,1.3497,1.1205,1.1721,0.8819,2.4174,0.5785,1.4446,0.0401,0.0207,0.0534,1.6713,0.6782,0.3116,0.0002,3.4573,0.0368,2.2542,0.9917,0.0002,5.7438,5.9424,2.9447,0.0002,4.5548,1.2769,1.2241,3.8369,2.906,3.1821,2.5543,3.3831,4.7041,0.044,0.0164,0.103,1.5274,0.0498,0.0038,0.0029,3.5709,1.8183,2.9157,0.321,0.598,6.8075,2.4013,1.352,2.2035,0.1395,0.0079,0.004,4.9791,0.1209,0.2823]}
{"id":251,"ended":true,"length":406,"text":"You teach Basic Undead Lore at the Arcane University, so your class is at the same time composed of freshmen necromancers, paladins, warlocks and witch hunters. The students are usually taught by their masters.\n\nThe basic theory of undead lore is the exact same for any class of undead. Here is an explanation on each class of undead.\n\nDeadly Necromancy \u2013 Necromancers can raise the dead. They can create undeath-type creatures from their will, and manipulate the death around them into undead creatures.\n\nThrone-Seeker\u2013 Seeker of evil, necromancers try to gain as much power over death as possible. They are more like wizards of evil than necromancers, and can control the undeath around them.\n\nGoblin Necromancers \u2013 The classic example of undead creation : Necromancers of Goblins. Goblins make the best necromancers, but even Halflings or Orcs can do that if they are evil enough. Goblins are also very fond of their necromancy powers because they can use that power for their own needs.\n\nNecromancer of Undead Spawn \u2013 Necromancer and Undead Spawn are the same class. All the classes of undead spawn are created and raised by necromancer.\n\nKiller Undeads \u2013 Deadly necromancers can create undead that are capable of hunting. If it\u2019s not the undead spawn, it\u2019s the killer undeads that are after your stuffs.\n\nThe Warlock \u2013 This is the only class that can turn themselves to undead. Also, warlocks can manipulate their undead followers and the undeads that they control.\n\nPaladin of Undeads \u2013 A paladin is the most basic member of any school of undead. He\/She protects his\/her allies, and defends their land from the undeads. If all the undeads are dead, then what\u2019s the point of a paladin of undead?\n\nWarlock of Undeads \u2013 No, this is different. A warlock of undeads is basically a warlock that can turn himself into undead in the same way that a paladin can turn himself to undead.\n\nWitchhunter of Undeads \u2013 Witch hunters can kill undeads, and can\u2019t turn themselves into the undead. If you\u2019re a witch hunter with an undead paladin and undeads in your back, then you will have an incredibly tough time.","token_len":504,"entropy":[9.5809,10.5767,12.0695,6.5456,3.8285,1.8712,5.2259,3.4206,1.8065,3.2777,4.8565,3.0664,1.5888,5.3498,1.5043,3.5652,3.1783,8.7711,0.0727,9.9652,12.0633,0.2383,0.0563,1.3798,6.1433,0.077,0.0001,0.1918,5.1936,0.1495,1.8014,6.3203,1.276,0.3969,2.6989,3.1062,1.6537,4.142,4.7639,2.1855,3.1797,4.2892,2.24,1.6001,0.0048,2.3225,4.538,6.6392,1.0975,3.6185,1.7658,0.5855,3.0274,5.8945,0.4874,4.047,3.7447,1.1399,2.3999,1.7907,1.2312,5.8246,1.7182,2.1271,3.5162,3.3282,5.8619,1.8014,1.0996,0.6078,1.4827,0.354,0.0002,5.5152,1.3417,2.6212,0.1454,0.3539,4.1264,3.3683,0.0392,0.8088,3.8059,7.0874,2.8653,0.8132,2.7834,1.9855,1.5857,3.6875,8.1069,0.0151,4.0445,3.0024,2.8668,3.177,2.5403,7.1874,1.4244,2.077,6.0947,1.8139,5.4341,5.1978,0.2354,4.2318,2.3659,2.0366,0.5598,1.89,0.0002,6.5789,4.097,2.8653,5.9987,1.9269,6.2213,6.9854,0.7798,3.1746,4.1278,1.4729,4.1764,0.044,0.0424,5.5599,0.0333,3.9368,5.1537,0.3146,0.8731,4.3657,5.5702,0.3944,0.3365,0.6908,1.1155,2.0914,4.2638,4.2141,4.7625,4.1028,4.4864,1.8904,3.5001,0.0421,0.0154,1.3139,0.9839,2.5226,4.0242,1.4486,9.9632,0.001,3.0793,0.1573,0.8267,0.7009,0.0002,5.0196,2.7012,0.0352,3.7143,0.4482,0.4493,1.1494,2.7381,9.1206,6.1305,0.2818,4.475,6.6974,11.8778,6.4057,0.0794,0.0218,4.7005,6.2812,0.047,1.8188,4.5115,0.007,4.6625,3.2676,3.5627,2.9965,0.1565,0.0242,1.0234,1.4816,5.2746,8.9652,0.3934,4.5312,4.5881,0.024,1.3971,3.2302,4.9596,5.2397,0.4563,2.2131,6.3132,1.6654,0.2208,3.9803,0.0064,1.2966,2.5474,2.8652,5.3062,0.0149,3.4736,2.7288,0.1546,2.164,6.0277,5.3319,0.6643,2.1339,2.9277,4.7984,0.6524,3.4803,2.0537,0.2205,6.8045,0.3904,0.4708,0.0003,4.3976,0.3319,1.1739,4.2469,5.1468,8.5822,0.9222,1.4464,2.7185,4.7006,4.284,1.387,1.2216,1.4572,1.5475,2.5392,1.294,4.5796,2.8861,2.115,2.1425,0.6375,3.1932,1.226,4.027,4.2167,3.9035,0.6665,2.6689,2.9799,1.539,1.3534,0.0002,5.9102,3.6083,1.1105,4.5069,0.5997,6.3263,2.4222,0.0767,0.0077,2.6122,2.4394,1.7475,2.4558,1.2843,4.7112,0.0265,7.6205,3.3861,4.0679,4.5131,17.3321,7.8496,1.0229,1.8954,3.3239,2.4418,5.6318,1.5374,1.266,1.7293,0.1378,0.0446,1.5101,2.7073,1.4837,2.9071,3.228,1.5516,7.2094,4.3037,6.4957,7.87,0.4689,0.6618,0.0003,3.4206,6.2307,1.9187,3.4952,1.7033,1.0189,3.7647,0.1777,1.4322,1.7245,5.038,8.6715,4.222,1.3319,0.9537,6.3607,1.4108,8.453,0.0347,1.5338,6.7809,2.3312,1.6857,6.5042,3.1088,4.0539,1.2303,6.3356,2.1243,1.442,2.9711,0.7969,0.4911,0.0003,5.8897,0.4835,2.943,0.7596,5.5771,0.3416,3.3219,1.4581,0.0633,1.9352,2.1295,2.3078,4.3822,5.8784,0.0714,3.1822,6.6068,0.7919,0.3529,0.3956,2.281,4.4959,2.8646,7.7705,4.119,0.2965,0.0087,2.7664,1.551,1.3988,6.2726,2.1304,4.5292,1.4773,1.8779,0.6047,4.1554,1.4527,4.4127,5.3308,1.8031,1.7333,1.0542,1.3107,2.3224,0.417,2.1725,5.4338,4.4822,1.1864,0.0517,1.2,0.7942,0.9066,2.3284,0.6848,0.0022,4.0843,0.1894,1.1893,0.8186,0.0003,3.401,1.2701,1.1537,0.3798,1.1042,0.5036,5.9596,1.5542,3.026,0.9646,5.8958,0.8983,2.2535,2.0312,0.0074,1.0664,0.0767,1.9937,1.1778,4.8243,0.7031,3.6307,0.1716,2.8443,2.2784,1.8525,1.4188,1.2669,0.8666,4.046,2.0426,2.8063,0.2694,1.1969,0.5554,3.0362,0.0067,1.7363,0.4973,0.4501,3.056,0.9076,0.5423,1.0189,0.0002,3.9755,0.6614,5.3494,1.6263,0.0737,0.8047,0.1011,1.9525,0.9085,2.0531,5.1488,1.2364,3.0406,2.095,1.331,2.5354,13.2335,0.4493,0.3305,2.9583,1.2846,0.6666,4.9087,0.313,1.7244,3.7919,2.3292,3.97,0.1464,1.7151,1.5609,0.4809,0.565,4.4389,3.438,0.5149,5.8318,0.0033,3.0115,4.8231,4.0017,3.0943,0.6043,6.9112,1.6608,0.9261,0.8332,2.9882,2.401,3.0798,5.5576,5.3903,1.8617,1.8256]}

He eventually finds Hagrid (a former caretaker and the school\u2019s most notorious bully), Neville Longbottom (a young and naive boy whose parents were killed in the Death Eaters attack) and most importantly learns the true face of evil (no, I\u2019m not going to spoil it).\n\nNow for the fun, my idea is that I would focus my time on Harry meeting his parents for the first time, learning the true nature of evil, his first duel with Voldemort (yes, it is quite short) and perhaps the final battle which may or may not be with Dumbledore at the end.\n\nI would like to keep some things from the original source material in order to keep it somewhat grounded, but I would like to explore the characters a bit more with some of their own adventures.\n\nI look forward to a great discussion!\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nJared","token_len":504,"entropy":[7.3837,6.1525,2.7524,5.2817,3.0823,7.0409,0.121,9.0266,0.8089,11.3319,0.5391,10.0595,1.4925,9.3989,2.7995,3.6838,3.8693,2.2622,0.8265,11.8051,7.9425,0.3763,6.8186,4.9758,7.6215,3.2532,0.2734,2.9078,4.4873,1.7641,5.6751,0.4471,0.7902,1.0707,5.3913,0.8337,1.0183,1.1659,3.2916,3.6318,5.146,2.1299,5.7818,4.9767,3.0142,2.6863,0.8999,1.5293,5.1054,4.086,13.5422,5.8576,7.3411,8.0468,5.8887,7.4212,8.7089,0.8052,1.5521,0.0004,4.5541,1.2638,3.3123,1.4899,4.726,0.3545,0.1013,0.2042,2.7845,2.9169,6.9508,4.8763,1.5976,2.4327,0.216,6.198,6.706,0.9437,2.9339,2.926,2.8883,1.0588,1.3886,5.3533,0.9439,2.4305,4.0595,0.0346,3.0957,3.4971,7.4223,4.3759,0.9007,0.0471,1.5587,3.828,0.8597,2.4024,3.0134,1.393,5.0225,0.2158,3.5017,3.214,2.689,3.994,3.3199,0.0943,6.6868,5.2376,0.5461,0.9748,1.5503,4.0281,1.2457,4.4376,0.0365,5.7962,3.2549,3.8917,3.4742,2.8634,6.1956,4.3663,2.3605,3.0756,3.9815,0.579,0.1004,0.0186,4.888,5.8421,4.0312,2.71,1.6179,1.1293,5.8767,1.1347,0.0004,3.3765,12.6586,6.6374,2.6659,6.543,0.2424,5.9238,1.6045,6.6194,2.178,1.1406,3.4906,1.1205,1.6441,7.1067,5.7126,0.986,2.6467,2.1032,2.579,0.0054,0.834,3.8883,6.8555,2.197,6.6911,3.1404,5.8715,5.9128,4.4942,0.3895,4.7826,5.2587,1.3427,7.7919,3.7771,0.011,3.4618,3.149,2.2297,0.1052,3.1492,4.5175,3.5797,4.3606,4.3053,0.0844,1.5375,4.1302,4.4629,5.3655,5.8597,2.2736,2.9317,0.2361,2.9926,2.4431,6.0353,1.9126,2.3246,4.8679,1.0429,0.1584,0.6544,1.7712,9.6034,0.7336,1.615,2.0107,0.0414,3.4408,0.1665,4.5181,4.3238,4.8929,4.7018,1.7632,0.881,2.8432,0.8329,3.5045,0.9516,7.281,3.5515,1.6561,5.6211,4.191,1.1256,1.174,0.0003,4.3885,2.325,3.8706,0.7396,3.4372,0.1032,0.0002,2.9297,1.1383,2.8823,5.4707,1.7199,5.6969,2.7686,0.8341,0.7697,4.5652,4.699,2.918,4.2423,2.7725,5.2699,1.0701,0.6948,3.9584,8.0938,2.6651,4.2979,7.033,2.3917,1.5661,5.0246,5.075,4.9308,5.4175,0.3284,0.0959,3.9485,0.8804,1.4038,0.0002,4.8584,1.1069,2.0008,2.1057,4.4415,4.3333,1.7865,3.0584,1.9662,3.9462,3.9605,1.6932,0.932,5.0904,3.0774,0.5519,0.9786,3.4737,2.1988,1.8311,4.6379,3.1871,2.3793,6.3166,0.5042,8.7876,1.0954,3.8066,4.398,0.4419,0.1767,0.0045,1.3038,4.1332,1.0598,0.9925,0.0002,6.4741,0.1776,0.023,1.3106,0.9342,3.1366,2.9336,4.3053,2.8067,2.4685,2.0998,5.1797,2.4786,8.8341,0.0001,3.8179,2.3076,3.1485,9.4813,0.0447,3.5209,3.6727,4.8543,9.9287,1.2765,0.3941,3.1637,4.997,3.8495,1.2564,6.9261,0.1496,0.0011,0.7768,0.7816,3.6387,3.2547,5.5882,2.657,4.0837,2.7517,2.093,1.8044,1.5754,1.4243,6.3231,0.2852,0.0024,2.2667,2.4766,0.0579,5.7037,0.6884,9.5049,2.1115,1.6401,4.5156,0.0608,6.2703,4.11,6.3937,1.9348,2.3705,7.3058,2.6593,1.4139,0.1996,2.674,0.0665,2.9044,1.709,1.8398,0.3725,0.0003,4.5709,3.7437,0.3866,2.8262,5.6874,5.3021,7.4983,1.4349,1.3602,2.238,2.5629,5.6223,4.223,2.4333,0.8112,2.4846,9.0164,2.2014,2.6897,5.3278,0.1607,0.1015,0.0076,1.9944,4.3226,2.1297,1.6433,3.5887,0.0388,3.2585,1.1973,3.9195,4.9737,6.8614,0.7591,0.8705,2.8138,4.5263,0.2073,2.8917,2.0124,5.0203,5.8577,2.1587,0.0983,5.1714,1.98,3.7504,1.5033,6.4693,5.054,1.7644,0.0031,0.0008,1.7775,5.0334,3.6935,4.3837,0.8668,0.4554,1.3427,0.5878,0.0003,2.2298,2.4998,2.1166,0.1278,4.9456,5.0359,3.9783,5.2775,1.511,4.5284,5.0017,2.015,3.7372,2.4973,0.2248,2.2632,2.1877,5.4285,6.7511,1.9706,0.9878,1.3729,2.6864,0.8731,0.222,6.1859,1.5711,3.5178,3.6286,0.6542,0.3998,3.9881,2.4717,1.2247,2.8032,4.2866,6.5744,0.729,0.7132,0.0002,2.2978,6.7923,0.1066,0.0136,4.781,3.6583,4.2773,4.3893,0.6785,0.0003,6.6106,0.258,8.8313,0.028,0.2032,0.2234,0.0003,4.1704,3.7796]}

How can the beak, feet and back legs be there but not the snozzberries.\n\n- Its back feet are actually flippers. A snake has similar feet and both reptiles can move underwater. Snakes use their backs feet to feel for prey.\n\n- But why does the devil allow the platypus and snozzberry back feet in the world.\n\n- The platypus has been given the name of \"God\" by the Australians. God is also known as \"Goode\" in this region of the world. The platypus is a sign that all the animals on earth can have characteristics of both the good and the bad. We must all have balance between the good and the bad.\n\n- What does this mean for me.\n\n- There is something wrong with your creation. This creature is in the same category as Hitler as they both are not completely evil. There are things happening on earth through the power of Satan that we would not like. It is best that you focus on things you control. Things of this earth can only be changed by you. Focus on the good and the bad. Be a light unto the world.","token_len":505,"entropy":[8.5816,3.1394,4.5125,5.0219,1.9501,5.0827,1.1986,7.2273,1.1555,10.3399,0.1597,4.825,8.3781,2.3749,6.9608,0.7539,1.9224,0.9321,2.6717,1.0052,3.9528,4.5967,6.1121,0.0837,5.1335,1.4437,6.3265,2.5848,12.2276,3.3159,6.4079,3.1601,8.9739,1.2822,0.0026,0.9919,4.7982,5.193,8.6719,6.538,2.4219,3.4168,0.1518,2.9177,0.7331,0.001,0.0058,2.2957,2.2243,7.4504,0.4898,1.8518,6.5081,3.4471,3.548,2.6491,2.3408,7.2603,0.5219,3.7257,3.859,8.6796,2.1939,9.6004,2.0783,4.4758,2.0166,1.9487,3.923,3.7236,3.653,7.0561,4.0226,6.9495,9.3143,1.5078,1.5564,5.0628,3.2732,13.1312,6.2168,2.0249,3.222,0.0025,0.0006,0.794,2.9808,7.5637,8.7728,0.4811,1.5301,8.9435,2.2421,2.9247,5.9491,0.77,3.5872,3.2077,2.8166,0.1431,4.3572,6.1069,1.6515,4.6692,4.2232,0.7057,3.2203,1.4081,7.7704,0.5384,9.3072,1.2118,4.9818,1.0019,6.7636,3.2758,1.1624,0.6265,4.2059,2.4862,5.2742,8.7037,0.0033,0.0076,2.395,2.8588,2.8997,4.3801,0.4906,5.525,4.0642,6.3909,4.2636,1.2578,3.3895,1.6406,0.2284,1.9766,1.9869,5.5712,1.8,0.9611,4.0213,2.0915,2.6558,0.0003,0.4161,5.4922,1.8498,1.4072,4.9995,0.0004,0.006,5.7086,2.3223,0.0002,0.299,2.1688,0.3471,0.0004,0.0015,0.6318,1.0878,3.847,2.7485,4.1595,0.8146,1.9956,0.7094,0.7772,6.1515,2.7562,0.3775,2.1962,0.0002,0.156,4.5834,4.1908,4.5943,2.1721,1.861,7.8273,6.2563,0.9014,4.0121,3.16,0.5705,0.0002,0.1172,2.2905,0.3196,0.0003,0.0027,5.672,0.021,2.4686,1.3722,0.4047,6.0605,5.209,0.609,2.4691,2.9964,5.8629,1.2815,0.9502,4.5272,3.9197,3.2233,5.606,7.601,0.9714,1.5183,5.8742,4.4426,0.7887,1.1578,4.0015,1.7052,10.028,3.1313,2.8632,4.8864,2.1867,1.7904,0.5051,2.3295,3.2418,0.0284,1.1511,4.7809,1.2802,6.4411,1.356,0.0855,3.691,3.2553,2.5993,4.3065,0.4486,0.327,3.147,3.8754,2.1506,4.356,0.1683,6.947,0.3393,1.265,0.0003,0.1004,5.7686,4.3239,3.4686,3.9499,0.5953,4.2039,7.6577,6.8595,2.3509,4.759,0.8206,6.8063,1.3389,3.0172,4.3745,0.755,3.8037,0.7417,0.1918,0.5032,0.2913,1.6197,5.7516,4.2408,1.3807,1.5263,5.6816,0.2138,0.0059,0.1269,1.9837,0.8215,0.0003,0.0917,4.5006,2.2962,1.618,0.5317,5.8895,6.6557,1.0365,0.9321,4.4082,4.8642,2.2877,6.5005,3.2547,2.0216,6.8249,8.3606,2.4513,2.5502,5.9987,0.7394,7.9279,1.1753,4.0605,1.5501,3.742,2.6474,0.5428,8.1324,4.8837,2.9725,0.9682,1.1167,0.0003,0.0782,3.9889,5.4317,1.7777,0.9655,8.8702,6.2235,1.3288,1.6182,0.0006,0.0023,5.3194,4.7437,0.4159,0.0086,2.7603,6.3177,1.2407,4.1677,0.9062,5.1031,2.3106,0.6186,0.0003,0.0971,1.3888,1.8474,0.0003,0.0035,2.0743,3.2152,4.1842,2.0953,1.877,1.8392,1.9382,3.4246,1.9525,1.2937,1.3335,7.9823,0.6086,3.5535,1.671,4.6103,2.4564,0.3424,0.9649,7.0817,7.617,1.6576,2.699,4.4355,3.9301,2.1264,0.9447,0.3313,0.3887,2.4216,1.6002,0.0005,0.0035,0.9031,2.2621,5.9089,1.551,5.1374,2.7691,1.8991,3.0279,1.1094,4.1986,3.3165,5.8579,2.288,4.7992,3.2709,1.7133,0.2286,1.9158,1.2551,1.1425,5.6794,3.3445,3.6537,3.6247,9.6439,4.4244,1.5093,0.3399,0.1094,0.4304,0.2317,0.5881,0.6945,0.0003,0.158,3.8652,2.5259,2.1856,0.7133,0.9716,3.6082,2.4132,0.5282,0.0003,0.0953,4.3698,0.7403,3.8872,1.2208,0.1952,3.8521,5.6988,0.4727,4.4369,3.268,1.0437,4.7647,1.9968,3.9418,2.4859,0.1771,7.1468,5.0828,3.914,4.8007,2.9034,4.1804,6.5266,2.0165,0.3976,4.0316,1.2223,3.9546,5.4813,2.3684,1.4739,6.6359,1.4094,3.3959,0.068,2.7753,2.923,3.0811,4.6235,0.9389,2.5399,2.96,3.3447,0.5374,6.6356,2.0785,2.2542,5.6627,0.1692,5.4231,2.5702,5.6301,1.0931,5.5092,5.6798,2.7333,5.2127,3.9552,2.5141,0.519,4.7625,1.2335,3.3826,0.4778,7.0861,0.165,1.6631,2.6643,1.4344,0.926,0.3545,0.6403,4.2818,2.7684,6.6761,3.5244,1.9229,2.3146,0.7299]}

That's all I'm saying.)\n\nSo, with this in mind, let's take a look at what happened to some of my readers in real life and see if the Stephen King-esque fan went down exactly how you'd want them to,\n\nNo Comment\n\nYou may also like\n\n7 comments\n\nGawd you take me back! LOL! I remember sitting on my parents' old brown bench eating chicken fried rice and devouring Misery. I also remember reading the other novels in the series which I enjoyed but never got to that one again (too gory?). Love the cover btw!\n\nOh girl, I so remember the chicken fried rice and the devouring Misery. I actually have had some of Paul Sheldon's work read to me when my sister's and brother-in-law would lend me one of his books. Yuck, but the story was intriguing and of course the cover blew me away too.\n\nWhen I was pregnant with my first child, I saw my doctor about something else, and he dropped a \"Just in case...\" comment which led into a conversation about post-partum depression. Now, what's the connection?\n\nI'd be soooo scared that it would be someone I know. I just read Misery on recommendation from someone I work with, and loved it. He told me that Stephen King said when he made up the character of Annie Wilkes after reading a fan magazine, that it was a caricature of a horror fan.","token_len":505,"entropy":[9.1178,12.6624,9.188,7.1628,5.2324,7.8636,3.0804,3.6472,1.0978,2.4836,4.9926,10.8404,6.0309,7.9551,1.6364,0.1991,3.8824,6.1366,3.7003,4.7935,6.2068,5.1458,0.9287,4.066,3.9234,5.9101,1.5492,2.5213,0.4029,6.0154,0.129,0.0336,5.8341,10.3672,0.4778,2.9149,3.461,0.0005,1.878,4.2257,0.0008,2.4334,1.7501,3.8447,0.8006,4.6849,0.0,0.2274,2.2386,1.0671,2.0199,3.9487,0.3344,2.6888,1.2231,4.6774,1.3303,0.373,2.8643,2.5616,3.5457,2.7882,1.1893,1.7804,3.8554,1.8661,4.4533,1.5476,4.3835,0.3608,0.9111,1.6544,3.9059,1.5623,0.0751,1.2812,2.7521,4.8689,0.2078,3.8235,0.5182,0.7144,0.0973,0.1529,2.1836,0.0002,1.3964,3.6457,0.0006,0.6527,1.1265,5.3777,0.0476,5.3527,1.0752,2.5937,1.5068,6.4106,6.2775,3.7822,9.725,0.0005,4.9299,0.5196,7.606,0.0142,5.0128,7.4319,1.0791,0.2683,5.1095,0.0002,1.145,1.6987,5.8469,3.7329,1.3306,3.301,4.7887,0.5907,4.5859,2.9326,9.1327,3.2972,4.6204,6.448,0.0975,7.192,1.1249,4.2002,7.8078,8.1779,3.257,4.9461,5.9267,0.2279,1.0175,10.1478,2.9492,6.077,6.8239,6.4254,1.9934,0.7443,1.0213,0.0002,5.9731,0.0379,3.3229,4.2181,1.0849,3.1997,1.1351,4.4108,6.0663,2.969,4.2767,5.9949,8.7054,1.6519,2.4949,1.5123,3.7013,1.0376,4.9673,3.6912,2.2454,1.8368,3.8035,1.8669,6.4606,2.7649,3.6269,1.5233,0.0681,5.5155,2.612,4.0244,4.177,4.0527,0.0318,2.0396,0.0964,3.3523,4.1447,1.8291,0.4537,4.3488,5.2034,3.4335,1.7896,0.2681,7.8015,4.1854,4.6864,0.6112,3.3493,0.556,2.1074,2.0951,2.0767,0.9113,0.0002,2.9233,1.8862,4.9911,3.1714,3.1173,0.0047,0.1053,2.1016,0.1412,2.0426,0.1507,0.2838,0.0977,1.9364,4.0098,1.7627,7.3657,0.13,2.457,5.1303,2.9964,6.5402,0.1062,2.8505,2.6086,1.5007,3.4853,8.5337,0.0058,3.6099,2.9596,6.413,8.054,3.523,7.5356,3.0265,3.0224,1.6853,3.9145,1.5338,0.1859,3.391,6.4218,0.0001,6.105,5.9582,2.2757,0.0002,4.3533,2.7272,5.3751,0.5782,1.8412,0.0002,7.3796,8.1157,1.4263,0.0002,6.9485,5.2301,4.3255,7.8386,7.3644,3.1219,3.3698,3.9161,8.1673,2.3872,2.7128,5.8607,5.4543,2.2924,1.1316,6.1676,0.9477,7.2755,6.8086,6.9645,6.079,5.393,5.0478,1.3719,1.8381,8.3739,0.1017,7.8459,0.0003,0.997,1.6194,5.0561,0.4085,3.1239,1.7605,5.3667,6.7909,2.5635,0.7436,0.9597,4.8147,1.5984,4.0238,3.9725,2.5454,2.8024,0.6211,7.0603,3.933,6.1134,3.8321,6.7187,7.472,2.519,6.3343,7.2198,2.5812,5.4135,10.4239,0.1498,1.8995,0.9118,0.0002,4.818,7.9112,0.8116,1.7009,7.6444,4.7968,2.3041,9.9139,0.2058,0.0099,2.3028,2.1473,5.1954,0.7347,1.5618,0.0002,1.0037,1.595,5.0212,3.9745,5.5865,2.9621,2.5131,7.846,1.7313,0.1139,3.4366,4.5894,2.9584,0.0444,4.5305,4.7868,3.5898,3.6349,4.968,3.365,3.6551,0.0065,0.0014,0.006,8.6499,8.4844,0.2809,4.667,1.4845,1.5679,0.7344,1.0775,6.912,3.8948,2.3035,4.9083,3.4372,3.4402,2.0329,6.9503,1.3972,6.6424,1.0536,2.7453,4.0248,5.9399,1.0973,0.0098,6.0244,0.418,1.0416,0.0002,5.9694,0.6108,1.8927,7.4613,0.8138,0.1519,1.3541,0.4543,0.5274,0.5973,4.3315,3.1734,5.1107,3.3314,5.7044,4.9483,2.6883,1.128,1.4935,8.1393,2.678,6.0836,6.3749,4.2613,0.0929,4.564,3.9554,5.9044,4.6775,4.4928,1.4832,3.4749,0.9963,7.9254,1.9495,1.0966,0.0028,0.3581,0.5675,5.6287,0.9722,4.6837,2.6846,1.8101,6.1384,1.3962,1.7212,0.0002,1.9033,4.2596,3.5044,3.2817,5.9626,5.7754,3.7089,3.4179,1.1072,1.6522,5.3769,2.4332,4.5166,2.214,1.5116,3.9046,4.2488,2.5744,0.0001,4.3702,8.9952,1.3374,3.0468,1.3871,6.1809,0.0815,1.8727,0.8026,6.1066,0.2629,0.6936,4.9936,3.6217,0.0477,1.3733,6.2716,0.0525,5.0634,5.6058,0.6684,4.4732,5.57,1.5396,4.4423,1.2009,1.3293,1.0521,0.0015,5.8288,3.3372,3.819,4.6495,5.7133,1.9738,1.1352,2.3565,0.6697,1.9005,8.5375,0.4214,2.8551,6.4925,4.7501,0.9712]}

An all-too-familiar scenario, but a few minor surprises make this a pretty thrilling read.\n\nIn \"A New Tomorrow,\" the first in an ongoing series, readers are told the story of the universe\u2019s newest race, the A-Ling, and their epic battles with the Xar, a group described as \"a bunch of murderous xenophobes.\"\n\nHere is an exchange between two of the heroes:\n\nThe A-Ling, in their own time, call themselves the Unalming. To people of their own age, they think of themselves as a \"paradise\" but a \"paradise that always has more than its share of suffering\" is more accurate.\n\nAnd in \"A New Tomorrow,\" there are some hints that their view of the universe might be correct:\n\nThe Xar, according to the A-Ling, seem to want to conquer every form of life in the cosmos. The human race, they say, is the one species that is too evolved, that has become too successful in its search for knowledge. When their ships were first discovered, the Xar made the mistake of assuming that any one technological society could dominate the entire universe. That was an abysmal miscalculation -- for only a space-faring species with far more technology than the Xar possesses could hope to take over a system.\n\nAnd the A-Ling are a space traveling race:\n\nFor the A-Ling, this was their first contact with another race in this star system. But it wouldn\u2019t be their last. If they came here one day, would they be the ones to enslave the Xar of this time? Not likely. But it\u2019s a possibility that worries the Human League.\n\nAnd in the second instalment, \"A New Reality,\" the Humans develop a highly advanced weapon (although one which they're unsure how to use successfully):\n\nAn almost invisible plasma ball would be aimed directly at the planet and fired as a \"bolt of lightning.\"\n\nAt least one of the stories -- \"A New Vision\" -- has a happy ending. And there's a short story titled \"Escape from Space\" which may appeal those who prefer a more fast-paced narrative.","token_len":506,"entropy":[9.8967,14.2459,1.2959,2.0803,0.0504,4.5245,7.1066,6.7346,3.0992,0.1347,2.0741,9.1003,1.0073,3.4626,0.0138,8.2227,5.8632,6.1004,3.0966,1.9007,0.5169,0.0517,3.6554,5.9474,7.2538,0.0194,0.6425,1.5937,6.2901,3.8716,3.0234,0.7446,5.7809,4.6553,0.1259,2.8437,0.0306,2.1003,0.0208,4.0289,2.4397,1.9492,3.3069,5.5189,4.776,3.7338,5.8265,1.7824,1.7053,4.4594,4.5293,2.6648,0.3207,1.1189,0.0466,4.123,4.2494,3.4776,2.7593,6.3934,1.0985,2.1904,4.0407,5.4053,3.0453,1.1543,0.1893,1.4659,5.5027,2.3318,3.5711,2.5211,1.4592,0.0396,1.8746,6.0761,16.2871,7.5122,6.8499,5.8463,5.8485,0.7428,1.3555,4.7377,3.4868,4.1324,4.2045,1.507,1.8936,1.8173,6.9254,4.8606,0.8459,1.1939,6.2542,6.6944,4.5914,1.6331,3.8181,8.7735,0.6863,1.3035,2.8822,4.5183,0.0234,8.3547,6.0471,3.1794,0.0103,1.9948,2.645,0.0002,5.8476,3.1643,2.6736,7.1372,0.6624,5.631,1.7465,0.6239,5.1333,1.4552,0.2117,0.0001,3.9642,1.4127,0.014,0.014,0.0046,2.8794,3.5355,2.1428,3.3699,5.8126,0.4414,7.1861,0.4227,0.8204,6.0112,5.8495,6.0972,1.3273,5.6099,7.2908,2.9487,2.4893,2.5867,3.4484,0.32,1.1117,5.595,1.5675,0.3202,0.2085,2.4502,3.7606,5.4653,0.6969,0.8485,1.69,5.0303,4.249,2.2249,4.5315,0.0933,0.2152,2.3984,5.8514,2.4122,4.6219,2.7832,2.5014,0.7501,0.0807,5.85,2.8121,7.0864,5.3434,4.8713,0.4877,1.619,0.0002,3.2687,3.2943,1.1032,1.0398,0.2171,0.2943,0.0741,4.7038,1.6584,2.3434,4.3715,1.6269,3.8784,6.5761,0.3069,1.0923,1.4977,2.383,1.2309,5.2869,2.2545,0.4128,0.0002,2.0302,3.2247,0.0673,1.8408,5.1608,0.0011,1.2882,1.0318,0.0065,0.0159,0.001,0.12,6.3134,0.5172,4.1711,0.6486,3.2693,3.8024,5.2689,0.0694,0.5936,2.8041,0.5088,3.238,1.1512,2.8357,4.9292,0.4036,1.7734,1.652,1.3243,0.0195,1.0886,2.6768,3.9263,5.0525,0.7225,2.1404,4.1575,7.5129,3.0396,3.969,1.9566,3.9484,1.4037,6.7462,2.2291,1.0684,4.7378,0.1478,3.7254,0.8043,5.2786,3.737,6.8848,4.7304,3.2155,3.3693,0.6809,1.6074,1.7447,0.0129,4.9722,3.239,2.7897,0.035,4.7709,0.5964,4.3259,4.3663,7.3404,5.7948,1.0591,6.6602,0.9571,2.0321,1.3071,0.6964,3.745,2.5278,3.5774,4.8613,2.8337,0.01,8.9234,0.006,0.0038,6.0769,4.3188,5.8622,1.2246,7.6036,0.6699,0.1178,0.0001,1.1358,4.7079,6.43,0.9824,3.979,3.069,1.2765,1.8449,0.0237,4.7075,0.6752,5.969,0.0465,4.1806,1.4299,2.6918,4.0676,2.6067,0.906,0.0003,2.49,3.1685,1.4627,0.0026,0.0023,0.0029,2.4645,4.1451,6.4869,9.3223,1.1846,2.2933,0.494,0.0002,4.8742,1.3837,0.7704,0.0021,0.003,0.0034,0.1514,3.1889,3.7619,2.6394,2.7489,4.9049,0.1095,4.0348,0.9224,4.1179,4.1635,7.6572,0.6298,0.6938,3.0061,3.0069,5.5819,13.1197,2.4966,0.076,0.7315,2.8006,0.3029,0.4401,4.5093,1.1451,4.8532,3.7051,6.6763,0.0877,0.2633,6.3562,0.3806,1.8311,3.3757,2.2784,1.2829,6.2636,0.0005,1.2323,2.3896,0.0109,5.672,2.2842,5.6367,0.3722,5.2028,3.0938,0.4222,2.9691,3.1881,3.1078,0.2641,1.1841,2.1783,1.1756,2.8797,7.9169,1.4511,7.7675,4.1024,1.1008,0.8004,0.0002,2.0898,1.7563,1.9111,3.6019,6.7341,0.0008,0.0004,1.2038,1.8478,1.1847,0.1368,7.0091,0.3853,1.2164,5.3773,7.6848,0.7314,6.633,1.1094,5.1051,5.4134,5.9958,4.5638,2.9318,1.7096,4.2458,4.628,2.4346,0.5582,0.7872,7.8608,1.5986,0.8498,0.0002,5.199,5.8429,5.8391,6.0077,4.9982,5.722,2.0778,7.0451,2.8352,0.139,0.5353,4.7874,2.7764,6.1537,4.7683,0.9918,5.3127,6.346,1.0577,1.9087,1.3129,2.5268,0.0002,5.1764,2.3051,1.7094,1.1762,0.386,5.9308,7.0403,2.0559,1.0752,0.1297,5.9399,0.9124,1.8865,3.7385,1.7748,5.9121,0.0162,1.0454,3.8756,3.5529,1.4801,1.2173,6.483,3.4839,5.6386,0.2179,5.5715,2.2016,1.0286,3.5657,1.6124,2.776,5.4561,6.3778,10.6516,0.6528,4.6253,1.9281,1.548,8.1988,0.672,0.022,2.3571,0.8301]}

She was certain her kids' nanny was breaking the rules by having a cellphone.\n\nThat nanny is in police custody awaiting charges after police pulled her over in North Carolina while she was driving a company vehicle with her nanny license plate on the back.\n\nWhat the nanny is accused of, or had done, remains unclear, but she will face charges relating to her failure to comply with her employer's cellphone rule and her failure to maintain the safety of the children while she was driving.\n\nIn addition to that, she will face charges for driving while under the influence. She is also under investigation for assault on a female while she allegedly assaulted a passenger who got out of the car when she was pulled over.\n\nShe will face criminal charges in both Maryland and North Carolina related to those incidents.\n\nAnd although the rules may seem extreme in the moment, it sounds as though these parents have a good idea of why this nanny wanted her personal phone.\n\nNannies can be a huge responsibility. But a lot of people would choose to work 40 hours per week and live off of the money they make if they had the support of the people who were employing them.\n\nWhile we are all for respecting one another's requests, these rules seem unfair even if the nanny in question had not crossed any lines.\n\nWe understand why the babysitter wanted to protect her privacy and keep some things to herself. But it's understandable why these parents are upset.\n\nSign up here to get INSIDER's favorite stories straight to your inbox.\n\nRead the original article on INSIDER","token_len":507,"entropy":[3.0338,7.2349,1.3869,5.7037,0.2174,5.1309,2.8172,7.2617,0.3507,5.2757,1.9716,3.4553,5.4192,0.3083,2.0648,2.763,0.4403,1.8126,0.4357,0.2013,4.9179,3.2747,3.9033,1.0248,0.1052,0.7996,7.446,1.3668,4.7068,6.6372,0.0001,0.3509,0.4573,5.9643,0.3557,2.1035,6.3248,9.0333,0.2381,5.3166,3.0897,0.9867,0.0151,2.8733,4.7058,2.0863,2.2892,5.0945,0.7299,0.1789,0.0794,0.0027,2.1963,4.1748,1.7835,1.687,2.9979,6.7747,2.3354,4.2091,0.1742,2.2223,1.1771,0.0049,2.7363,1.5432,5.6359,1.1361,3.5869,8.1186,3.4259,0.4591,2.0577,8.507,0.4522,0.3604,0.7476,3.5975,7.2119,2.6001,0.2814,7.1244,7.5943,2.086,2.9823,2.2124,0.5539,0.4652,1.9706,4.5776,2.4755,4.9394,2.3171,6.37,0.0248,6.3204,5.8251,1.5986,4.1895,3.0532,2.9092,1.2858,4.9985,2.5318,1.2935,6.4896,2.0427,7.8588,0.372,2.5376,1.3859,0.835,0.7194,0.6202,0.0002,2.053,4.6768,0.0126,5.8976,5.6541,4.8469,4.644,2.1187,8.7474,9.6725,3.2337,1.4556,7.4923,0.5699,0.2395,1.9486,2.3368,5.5202,3.6662,2.3709,1.0609,2.361,5.5506,1.5446,0.7261,2.9744,2.3727,1.2001,0.4628,0.5921,0.5325,0.0002,3.995,5.0832,5.3967,4.6006,8.1218,0.2635,7.3066,1.0556,0.4313,0.9477,2.1734,1.1108,3.9439,0.0074,0.0599,1.966,5.4979,1.2103,4.1555,2.2889,1.7363,0.7608,0.5629,1.0364,2.234,3.569,5.7971,2.4301,1.4706,2.2556,3.3048,6.4774,2.347,0.9322,2.609,5.4098,0.0213,1.6716,5.3501,0.3412,0.2916,3.9715,4.0505,1.9348,1.7675,3.0219,0.4681,0.0001,4.6845,5.398,0.0027,2.4902,4.5334,5.5522,0.0225,4.2757,4.2209,3.4496,3.2185,5.5937,1.6807,0.7636,2.0285,4.9997,0.7362,5.0129,0.9443,0.1647,1.1769,2.6569,8.295,2.0354,4.0875,0.7863,6.087,0.0044,7.62,1.1042,3.3096,2.1071,2.4525,0.6888,0.8014,0.0002,5.3509,2.9499,1.7344,0.0075,3.1036,2.1716,0.0105,4.6399,5.1747,5.4575,3.1454,0.8242,6.7582,1.3484,1.5409,0.5867,2.7625,4.7395,2.1088,1.5985,6.4723,0.0094,2.1248,4.5294,0.0149,2.867,0.0931,2.9214,7.1183,0.0228,6.5705,5.4088,2.4766,2.3557,1.2007,0.0189,3.6642,2.1512,3.8241,0.0876,2.3339,1.0018,3.7538,2.5746,0.4054,0.9062,0.9079,0.4067,0.0002,3.5668,2.0387,0.4061,4.3075,0.4473,2.2184,1.9971,0.9424,2.0175,1.3789,3.8522,1.169,1.7993,0.0189,0.0005,2.3833,3.064,1.884,0.9576,4.265,1.0266,0.4237,7.0443,2.952,0.2872,5.3585,5.2132,1.7587,8.6038,2.8146,1.3056,5.6673,3.6356,4.9968,1.6169,0.0764,0.8807,0.2751,3.7458,0.7791,0.6259,3.6074,0.0265,0.6068,0.3935,0.0002,3.8195,2.4082,2.3016,3.8253,0.2551,2.8542,3.2946,7.186,0.0445,1.613,0.0105,5.4038,0.0068,3.6443,2.587,0.4755,0.589,0.0002,4.5313,4.7583,1.3001,5.6391,3.55,1.5324,5.1898,2.9351,2.1932,5.16,0.1625,2.0614,6.3498,2.4009,1.0971,3.2473,2.2012,2.3907,2.4871,4.0793,1.7272,0.6087,4.6286,3.3447,4.773,0.0108,8.4762,2.7107,8.2896,3.0889,2.7423,0.4242,0.0001,6.1207,4.0473,1.5417,3.3413,1.2548,2.6304,4.5227,5.3678,1.7774,3.4272,4.4989,3.373,0.2217,2.1108,4.3645,5.4747,0.4752,5.4133,7.6359,0.2927,2.3857,0.0369,2.366,3.7102,2.3185,1.8148,3.3026,2.8817,1.3867,1.0221,4.424,0.4074,2.6044,2.1653,5.6676,0.278,2.8583,4.376,1.2462,4.6851,10.2245,0.3359,0.2812,0.5711,0.0002,4.7231,3.3779,3.2627,1.5276,4.0838,6.7358,5.3868,1.2917,0.6473,9.3196,0.5052,4.0962,3.636,3.3347,6.2928,5.8512,2.498,2.2787,1.1715,0.0223,5.5751,0.0393,2.8346,3.9992,7.0377,2.1752,3.3425,0.4507,0.6152,0.0002,3.0401,5.0435,3.8454,2.2732,4.9274,0.1231,3.1502,0.787,4.3731,0.417,6.1826,1.9116,4.124,5.9211,4.1676,2.8514,0.0337,1.0274,1.0032,2.5384,1.1559,4.6127,1.3925,3.4242,0.4361,2.4226,3.1394,1.7264,0.6149,0.0001,7.307,0.3563,3.3753,1.3966,1.4276,8.4913,0.0781,0.6627,9.0547,0.7755,5.2412,0.0215,0.0004,0.0021,0.43,0.7884,0.0003,3.7065,4.2961,2.251,2.4723,0.6453,0.2779,0.0295]}

You are sitting in your locked cell waiting to post bail when you hear faint screams and even some gunfire somewhere in the facility.. Not being able to leave your cell, your heart begins to race.. You have no idea if the attackers are still there, if a guard was hurt or what is happening.. You're about to call for a guard when a loud pounding sound shakes the facility from end to end \"AHHH AHHH AHHH AHHH AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!\" Suddenly a large man with spiked shoulder length hair and very dirty clothes enters your cell and slams the door shut behind and locks it.. He walks casually up to you \"Whatcha doin', boy?\" he said in a slurred but very deep voice as he rubbed his shoulder. \"I'm fine. I'm not doing anything..\" he replied in his deep and slightly raspy voice. \"What you got to say to me now, you dirty bitch?\" he said, in the same slurred but powerful voice. \"I have nothing to say to you..\" he said trying to get out of the cell \"You do now.\" he said, looking at you and holding his arm open wide \"Hmmmm whatcha gonna do now?\" he asked staring into your eyes. Suddenly, the guards pull you out of the cell and lead you to where the gunfire is coming from \"What's your name?\" They ask. \"Just call me the Duke\" you say \"Duke\" and the guards lead him to your cell and set him down on the floor in your cell \"Alright, Duke.. What the hell was all that about?\" one of the guards asks \"I don't know. I've been waiting to get out of here and now the fucking Duke is in my cell. What the fuck?!?!\" you shout \"I said I don't know..\" he says \"Whatever. Get outta my cell as well\" one of the guards shouts, \"Fuck 'em\" you reply \"Hey dude what can I call you?\" he said still rubbing his shoulder \"Call me what you want\" you reply. A few weeks later, you are released from prison after the judge who heard your case decided there was not enough evidence to convict you.

But his problem gets a bit worse when he discover he has octuplets. What do you do? Give him a hand? Or, leave him to his troubles.\n\nRules:\n1. No cheating and use of cheats, it's not accepted.\n2. Give answer only if you had seen the movie.\n3. You have 3 hours until the game.\n4. The octuplets are male.\n5. The King has only one heir named : \"Javier\". Only a son can succeed the throne.\n\nYou should make sure you know the plot ( and that is very very simple ) before you post.\n\nWhat do you think about the game?\n\nIt's a really nice movie and I think you'll know that by now lol...

It didn't have to be that way!!\" - David Tyree\n\nI was in this situation many times... I had a similiar situation with my older half brother but he passed away before I could choose his heir.\n\nSo I would chose my niece or his wife (my second cousin) because I thought that they would have a good chance to inherit and I didn't need to worry about a rival pretender. So it would probably be more effective if you choose an heir who's closer to you, like a niece.\n\nBut if you really hate that idea, and you must choose someone else, I would choose the youngest son. That way, they wouldn't be as ambitious and, if you die before they inherit, they won't be mad and try to overthrow you.","token_len":509,"entropy":[3.8828,4.1252,4.9177,4.5085,8.4661,0.0288,8.1459,10.482,0.232,0.8268,1.0959,1.9504,4.7876,0.8522,5.7879,1.8054,4.0895,2.3789,2.484,3.0584,1.4399,8.2961,0.0038,1.5217,4.6775,0.5346,2.024,14.489,4.6401,0.1737,1.9456,3.0023,6.4131,1.3164,3.382,4.1176,5.0759,2.6134,1.1006,1.9872,0.0158,4.8053,5.0666,3.9668,0.7252,2.1682,1.5349,3.6026,3.1167,3.9961,1.2621,0.0018,0.4343,2.0248,3.5974,0.6806,4.4775,0.0012,2.3968,4.4873,4.069,1.7988,1.1996,1.7319,3.8481,0.9163,5.8292,6.5354,3.8584,2.1595,5.3927,1.8217,2.4647,4.0461,5.9607,7.2952,4.6279,2.4434,1.6206,1.5916,0.8578,10.7481,3.7512,1.3358,4.0502,0.128,0.0293,0.5385,5.307,1.9177,0.2385,0.2902,0.4165,6.6404,0.3869,1.0898,5.0185,2.4755,4.1185,3.3855,5.4791,0.3405,2.274,2.5399,5.8534,1.9547,1.0912,0.0002,9.6765,1.72,0.5745,14.4394,0.6762,3.1558,5.0489,3.9747,5.3068,0.8948,4.882,0.0412,3.1983,4.9555,0.6479,2.392,6.2273,0.992,0.6173,14.3608,0.0016,5.9802,10.254,4.3792,1.9844,0.6764,6.8623,7.0145,1.065,7.1085,1.524,0.5554,12.747,0.001,3.3279,2.4937,5.0178,4.5878,3.9182,1.081,2.2493,4.6906,0.4755,10.1361,0.0014,2.7891,7.5011,0.1289,0.4351,1.2919,10.1114,1.3822,0.872,12.1965,0.0012,2.1902,5.7747,2.6164,4.852,1.5149,6.2008,6.6542,8.6836,4.1068,4.4881,5.0872,1.74,6.0591,3.6467,5.8563,1.4917,4.6888,3.3771,1.3995,0.4688,0.4438,0.0004,5.0661,3.42,3.9825,0.9062,1.2257,3.1346,1.4325,6.821,5.7082,7.4613,4.3488,5.9511,4.5058,6.5471,4.564,3.624,1.8491,1.2444,6.659,2.2826,0.8788,0.0003,5.2031,2.1245,0.204,0.8774,1.4382,1.4387,2.0408,0.5365,1.6342,0.0005,5.2158,0.7105,1.5382,3.4899,2.6706,8.2104,1.8874,1.6751,2.8502,2.7143,1.6544,8.6524,3.0959,4.2862,2.4628,8.2468,5.644,5.7278,4.388,0.0014,3.1967,5.8036,6.6886,0.9816,0.8335,0.0005,7.5482,1.1008,7.7105,2.9817,2.2826,2.0855,3.6689,3.7396,1.8116,3.2904,2.7387,2.4464,4.3716,1.2102,3.3447,3.1089,0.0162,2.2169,0.8005,4.8868,0.7882,1.9079,0.9277,4.1032,2.2925,4.867,4.3859,1.8631,1.4276,5.8316,3.7354,1.6282,4.6253,3.4327,2.7523,1.5026,2.66,6.4826,3.0013,1.8869,3.0163,1.9164,6.5338,3.3459,1.1497,3.2906,1.5564,3.357,3.5693,0.6764,1.3161,0.662,0.3778,4.5771,7.0856,3.6373,2.3388,2.5884,1.0359,2.2908,0.8753,4.9376,1.7153,0.1375,3.2496,0.4649,2.0637,7.331,2.9187,1.9614,0.0004,1.678,0.2459,6.3153,1.9311,8.4713,2.4447,1.3282,4.5476,0.1616,1.6017,3.7498,4.376,4.8627,1.6616,0.2672,0.3408,0.7726,2.4682,0.0371,0.3071,4.6336,2.1737,6.7751,7.1253,1.2309,0.0003,3.3852,7.2152,5.0947,5.5111,10.2261,5.2847,3.9501,2.9171,6.1598,0.0003,4.2385,0.3808,0.5101,1.9809,0.1026,6.6631,0.2679,5.0814,6.4241,0.4894,0.4701,0.0002,3.9558,3.7243,4.1915,4.2013,3.6424,4.7405,0.6931,4.4007,1.6811,3.1921,1.7885,10.4472,2.0181,0.433,2.1698,1.8639,4.8911,7.4148,0.4959,5.0695,1.6162,6.9964,0.1124,3.77,0.8338,1.6531,7.1203,2.8757,1.9247,0.5932,2.48,0.0002,3.2711,1.7859,4.6173,8.658,1.3749,6.3365,3.7151,4.971,3.6414,3.8751,3.7754,4.166,1.3457,1.1158,2.7333,1.367,2.6144,2.1674,2.7984,0.946,2.7269,1.1006,1.9945,2.693,1.81,2.5555,4.4524,1.9634,2.984,0.0006,4.704,0.6357,2.2681,0.4344,4.3582,5.2924,12.8567,0.8093,1.0535,3.6956,3.6063,3.6547,4.3648,0.8152,3.7106,4.0871,2.2937,3.3502,3.9686,4.4261,0.4741,2.4142,3.2386,6.332,0.1529,1.9242,2.3886,3.3409,2.3978,5.5584,1.8296,0.7347,0.0002,3.0485,3.3263,0.4254,4.5419,5.2994,3.6679,2.9319,0.8465,4.186,1.1553,6.7709,2.0047,2.7539,2.9813,1.0077,2.8279,1.9208,2.6043,2.6897,5.6399,3.0738,1.4573,3.6779,1.6416,1.6879,4.603,2.4192,0.0006,1.779,3.5647,7.5254,1.8285,6.1978,2.2382,1.5696,5.0338,2.6202,2.1855,3.8926,0.4431,1.2566,2.2215,0.0025,1.2934,6.8724,3.1432,4.5267,0.1103,5.8244,0.6839,0.4854]}

This mission will require you to understand all the requisitions for the vehicle repair workshop and to assess the various types of vehicle maintenance and the various components to be replaced. Your mission is to build a plan of action. The mission is based on the maintenance of a M113 AVLB.\n\nCarry through the mission, and you will be able to add an armored personnel carrier to your company.

{"id":4449,"ended":true,"length":482,"text":"You've been skyping regularly with a new internet friend when you slowly begin to realize that the city in the background of the video call is not of this earth...\n\nThe video is a product of a viral production by a group named Project Blue Book, and it offers up an eerie, sci-fi look at what Earth-like planets might look like as seen from space. A lot of the film looks surprisingly like the scenes above, with massive floating blue structures and barren land. It may seem that nothing is happening on this planet, but that is because little is happening on the surface of this giant sphere. That's because these massive spheres are simply orbiting the sun and the air is barely even moving above the surface of the ocean in certain regions.\n\nThe video is very creepy to watch, but its creator is very hopeful that people are paying attention to science. The creator, a filmmaker from Florida named Ben Mezrich, has worked in many different capacities in the entertainment industries and in academia. He is a former journalist and has even authored several books. One of his books is called \"The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook.\" He is also the creator of and founder of the Project Blue Book website. His work in academia has led to several awards.\n\nA lot is at stake for people in terms of believing or disbelieving the existence of extraterrestrials. Because it is so unknown at this time, it is very difficult for people to accept that there is a possibility that there are extra-terrestrials of other planets in the universe. But according to the film, the technology for the technology to fly a spacecraft to the next star system right now exists. If that is the case, it seems possible that this technology might be able to be used to find some of these strange cities, too.\n\nThis is just a product from Project Blue Book as there are others that have attempted to look into the reality of what life on other planets might look like. And it is true that a lot is up in the air, but the filmmakers of this product do their best to provide audiences with an entertaining short in the hopes of inspiring some serious conversation among scientists.\n\nRelated:\n\nHave you ever wanted to see what Venus or Mars would look like if viewed from Earth? This clip from the 2013 National Geographic program \"The Search for Life Beyond Earth\" takes you on a journey to see what that might look like--provided there was an atmosphere or atmosphere on either of those planets.","token_len":512,"entropy":[5.5189,2.4348,10.1614,5.5496,0.0705,8.9958,4.2193,2.922,3.6875,7.6224,3.9427,6.3707,0.9486,11.1701,3.9263,0.2721,3.5123,0.6888,2.7955,8.012,4.71,3.6753,2.8942,3.5937,2.0615,2.3716,9.3846,0.897,2.6324,6.2298,4.3014,5.5324,5.7221,2.3205,0.1182,2.9845,2.6417,2.2972,2.5196,7.3294,0.0586,1.6856,5.9071,7.812,3.2396,2.7898,3.4528,4.261,5.0308,4.752,5.0513,1.6814,2.5069,1.7289,6.3349,2.767,2.537,4.7461,2.2649,6.8503,0.0195,0.0013,1.6408,0.187,2.7481,7.1366,3.7189,1.6173,2.2124,1.2492,0.3171,0.0036,3.6769,5.4579,0.6716,0.8088,0.3698,4.6971,4.0783,0.2452,1.5578,5.4639,3.7802,7.6591,1.7962,1.7617,6.7646,5.3294,0.5519,2.137,6.5978,6.0662,5.777,5.3673,2.2145,7.2051,3.8115,1.9955,2.753,4.9975,2.0944,4.256,5.9727,1.7574,2.6636,2.731,2.4719,0.5441,0.5176,0.2011,3.4217,2.2945,2.0879,7.7378,1.3708,1.6314,1.6951,1.6193,1.4605,0.8267,1.5798,5.1946,5.0455,0.9702,4.9209,1.3332,1.3172,4.68,3.9498,3.5839,0.8153,5.6689,5.101,1.3662,2.002,2.4057,2.9127,6.6874,1.4289,6.2448,5.0186,4.0119,6.1148,1.2554,0.8393,1.6033,0.497,5.4237,5.0552,7.4082,2.8661,0.862,1.2834,0.0003,1.6867,2.3782,1.9701,4.2108,3.9776,4.5736,1.4381,0.7452,1.2924,5.0746,6.3308,2.3505,3.688,6.7636,1.0257,3.894,3.4773,5.3993,0.0953,1.3098,8.2391,1.849,2.6094,4.7786,2.6874,4.3685,4.4637,3.1294,4.9976,0.9638,5.2951,6.4874,3.2174,3.7531,0.2803,2.139,3.8416,3.1052,4.4096,1.9705,5.6881,2.3749,0.6867,4.0027,5.0203,2.3356,3.7875,4.6823,0.9967,0.939,1.9338,1.7159,3.2365,4.276,1.3969,3.181,6.0418,6.4671,2.4296,0.5039,1.6923,4.1436,0.2334,0.6881,2.1657,0.8052,1.577,1.3008,1.3525,7.8651,0.2816,6.5282,2.4592,1.3403,1.3522,9.3485,0.8769,7.514,1.3636,2.0074,1.9658,1.1466,1.6481,2.0625,0.0776,7.161,3.8654,0.1092,1.192,4.6624,0.0504,0.0122,1.7981,0.9578,3.9686,2.9865,4.2396,3.7409,1.024,3.0061,0.6735,2.5092,2.5566,2.7342,1.0775,0.0002,4.528,2.288,4.3615,3.6941,0.0125,1.4777,3.8255,2.3467,6.5109,0.0014,9.0117,6.0241,3.8913,0.0058,1.8268,2.8511,0.0419,2.309,1.5281,0.0012,0.0001,0.7641,5.6499,3.6247,0.8356,1.7854,6.5657,3.6677,0.6987,1.3337,0.4031,1.9434,0.5992,2.4674,1.0389,1.163,1.2398,0.2059,4.9154,1.3619,1.8308,0.7516,1.3549,3.7094,0.622,1.9288,2.0136,6.9528,2.0356,0.0496,1.4924,0.0031,0.0081,5.3978,4.4507,1.1052,2.0899,0.6076,1.2247,0.4468,3.2532,5.7175,0.0026,1.3352,3.9249,0.4427,2.1228,6.3469,3.1495,3.3852,3.6846,1.4179,4.8283,4.9117,1.0984,2.3465,2.5875,3.9297,2.2259,2.8213,8.8492,0.5629,4.4933,0.8104,4.1657,2.3533,2.021,0.7958,0.0206,0.1399,2.1245,3.9466,5.2958,0.1477,3.3981,1.8335,2.4255,1.1589,1.2432,0.0045,3.382,0.596,0.6918,3.8041,4.101,2.7191,1.4744,5.3349,8.6856,2.964,4.9392,0.1345,0.5171,0.0002,3.4756,1.5038,3.1723,2.0049,7.9045,6.0488,1.2489,0.0106,0.0018,5.9817,4.9252,0.8024,4.5718,1.9856,1.5428,5.3191,0.3298,4.6187,1.2735,1.0721,5.5894,0.2294,4.3636,2.8908,1.9788,2.0366,0.2485,0.434,0.2237,0.0019,0.4613,4.1538,2.3978,1.0863,4.8194,0.0729,4.0555,0.2281,3.3679,5.5061,1.9584,0.0318,0.0014,2.1031,0.7542,2.3698,4.6167,4.242,1.5479,6.8568,3.6038,4.9861,0.097,0.0847,3.3147,5.8863,0.1579,2.1809,3.6395,6.9997,5.1023,2.6156,1.438,1.7722,3.8148,2.9388,4.0862,3.3301,5.2777,3.0618,1.0843,0.8785,0.0003,5.2315,1.3147,1.4032,0.0002,6.9867,0.6866,1.2195,4.2033,0.0339,1.3047,3.1809,6.2494,4.6277,0.4312,2.119,0.065,0.0005,1.7066,6.1675,0.4312,2.2631,0.2673,3.7048,5.9931,1.3114,1.228,6.0141,5.5147,0.0412,6.4894,1.0976,1.9451,6.06,0.1635,2.3222,7.0289,0.4031,0.1626,4.4906,1.1388,1.4251,0.2412,1.5996,1.6578,2.4665,1.3376,4.1943,2.0427,0.2121,0.0008,8.6845,7.871,4.106,4.978,2.677,4.3958,3.7653,2.1453,3.6347,3.2739,2.2059,1.6207,0.369,0.196]}
{"id":433,"ended":true,"length":459,"text":"Humanity is long gone, but a surprising legacy is left behind by the gods on the Moon. The first ever settlement in a place that has no real atmosphere, no water and no sun. However, thanks to an experimental satellite-like habitat, NASA is leaving behind the first colony of people to establish life outside of Earth.\n\nNASA plans not only to leave behind a mission to leave behind the astronauts and the technology that would make their mission possible. This also includes a colony and all of the technologies required to sustain human life for generations to come.\n\nScientists are calling this endeavor the \u201cLunar Gateway\u201d and it is the first in a long chain to help humanity establish permanent presence on the moon in the future.\n\nThis project is the first real plan to set up a permanent colony on the moon, but there are many plans to create human settlements that would help in the long term.\n\nIn the last 50 years, we have seen a rise in asteroid mining, manned space stations and missions to the moon or Mars.\n\nThe first human settlements to ever be placed outside of earth\u2019s orbit have been developed to provide a safer base from which manned missions can be sent further in cosmic space.\n\nIt has been estimated that the total cost of the overall mission, which is expected to cost 100 billion dollars, will require up to 40 private contributors of about 15 billion dollars each.\n\nBut many of the other investors would prefer that the private investment in the project be at least partially government-backed and the private sector is said to be waiting to get access to lunar resources.\n\nThese lunar colonists could be a boon for this area, providing labor for future projects in this region of space. The first human colony could help create thousands of jobs in the region and also act as a launchpad for more ambitious missions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty amazing moment,\u201d said Kathy Lueders, the NASA official heading the Gateway development.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got everything ready to go as soon as we can start with the development. Now we\u2019re focused on getting some commercial partners.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we are able to get that momentum going with the private sector, this can be turned into a very big, sustainable, self-sustaining enterprise, which will open the door to other science and exploration missions that can come here in a more affordable way,\u201d said Lueders.\n\nSource.","token_len":512,"entropy":[7.4121,2.5141,7.565,2.2071,1.3,1.6159,4.2184,7.8,6.0481,1.8228,2.9773,0.8406,4.1777,1.1809,6.9845,6.2855,1.5717,4.3088,0.4973,2.459,4.6032,5.5802,8.8517,2.5606,3.2332,5.8013,2.4712,2.2709,3.7996,5.2534,6.928,1.5071,2.9069,3.6162,2.473,0.3064,3.7701,1.0666,6.7631,0.1637,5.1982,0.0085,3.7923,5.8381,5.2337,4.2438,3.1327,6.1637,1.2742,6.1144,1.8124,8.4315,1.8375,2.3575,4.0996,4.4662,1.1984,3.7315,2.4751,6.2228,3.7294,4.2826,1.108,1.0226,0.7567,1.1618,0.0012,3.2481,5.7334,7.2303,1.2785,0.1967,5.2262,1.1436,2.2145,7.8243,0.6696,5.3994,1.6075,1.5396,5.5233,2.9044,2.001,5.3489,1.7355,3.0073,2.2249,3.7967,4.0192,0.492,3.9157,4.5419,5.3246,2.3279,1.6795,5.8295,5.1979,5.5403,1.5066,0.6791,4.3767,3.7485,0.261,3.9254,3.019,0.8997,3.7628,3.8081,0.4697,0.0055,0.147,0.905,0.0002,5.1267,1.9786,4.6958,1.2525,6.353,1.3372,15.0244,6.3322,5.1938,1.7116,0.0614,6.6446,1.2563,7.6966,1.5619,1.571,1.3441,2.3244,0.856,4.2009,0.6696,2.4531,7.1632,4.3977,5.8553,2.3396,4.2644,6.088,5.4427,0.8377,0.3224,1.9846,4.1437,1.3392,2.8276,0.1025,0.763,0.0002,3.6359,2.3955,0.9569,2.6119,1.4286,6.4062,6.6013,0.9156,4.4659,1.288,0.7012,2.9971,1.5456,0.5096,0.2956,0.6667,1.8306,2.2698,3.3278,0.6258,1.6245,6.004,1.4594,3.5779,4.3739,2.1207,3.7271,1.5452,3.8608,4.8702,1.317,1.7037,1.6765,0.4225,0.7173,0.0002,3.8105,1.6981,4.1242,3.846,0.0839,0.5921,3.2068,0.4129,1.7381,1.9978,4.1229,0.2277,6.7018,1.8815,1.079,3.7573,0.7342,4.2904,0.9377,5.8066,0.7138,1.4777,0.6803,6.7075,1.7688,0.4594,1.5727,0.0002,2.3815,2.8787,2.6629,2.6002,2.8884,3.4107,1.8389,4.2297,5.8862,0.9369,3.9736,9.5672,5.6479,6.5332,2.7179,2.6131,0.5269,6.224,3.843,2.9558,1.7124,5.161,5.9145,3.8729,0.3234,6.5394,1.9867,1.5014,1.2727,4.3152,6.7476,3.4756,10.6733,0.6929,0.4033,0.257,0.0002,4.275,2.8142,0.683,1.2782,0.0951,2.3743,3.8925,1.8302,0.4215,2.174,7.8117,2.7342,4.2508,1.914,1.5762,2.6473,0.0065,1.4248,7.9653,0.3636,0.4073,0.4529,1.3314,8.0016,4.2525,0.0026,4.2474,8.117,8.5344,4.3112,4.0286,4.5167,1.6767,0.4532,2.5098,0.4358,0.3378,0.0002,4.7245,4.9077,1.5229,1.1305,4.4903,6.6998,5.3388,3.229,2.5913,1.476,5.3559,3.6525,3.5282,1.1292,2.0315,1.0015,5.2103,0.5319,3.3383,6.5936,2.4226,3.4841,2.1483,3.4887,3.3694,3.4121,3.6111,7.3256,0.0081,0.5186,6.7187,1.6094,3.5166,6.8666,0.0618,5.4526,0.864,0.5535,0.1754,0.0002,4.6418,7.0338,3.3228,2.7298,1.5088,3.3427,3.7305,1.135,6.5434,6.5612,2.4831,4.0623,7.9812,1.4193,3.8213,5.9199,3.18,3.0634,2.4215,2.9743,1.4273,0.4925,3.7869,3.0675,2.2296,2.6369,2.5567,2.9494,3.7477,6.2369,0.1154,0.6934,1.6925,0.9845,2.4547,1.7021,3.972,7.139,0.0321,0.2909,5.8713,1.9621,0.2368,4.4939,5.576,2.249,1.4754,0.1692,0.0002,4.0416,1.5625,5.8241,6.8887,5.4056,0.6295,2.2211,6.3158,2.9882,4.5845,2.9981,4.4812,5.7617,5.2561,8.8412,4.8416,6.5454,2.0391,0.5697,2.8379,4.5862,6.034,7.2708,0.6841,10.19,6.6755,0.9117,0.3408,0.0002,1.8274,0.4322,3.3355,2.7718,3.7212,3.358,3.0623,6.2966,3.4574,1.4563,0.7659,4.4895,1.0604,0.0035,1.161,1.711,6.6075,5.0639,1.5473,5.1983,3.5935,5.0108,1.2942,2.3729,1.5719,2.1967,6.0755,0.0665,2.3077,5.1246,6.3188,3.5897,3.7342,1.4694,3.3941,0.9873,0.0002,1.4416,0.0844,3.8491,1.0856,2.6196,1.1146,0.0439,1.391,3.2018,7.3336,2.1137,3.6874,1.4193,4.0949,1.5545,0.6449,3.5768,3.8824,1.1692,8.4735,0.3848,0.5753,3.5779,2.254,4.5282,4.5954,2.3216,6.4286,0.1541,0.4066,0.0696,0.0034,2.9034,2.6432,3.277,1.8362,6.019,2.0843,0.5803,0.619,2.6073,7.2611,1.1293,4.8857,3.7263,2.3899,3.1993,4.0008,3.7892,1.8316,2.6612,5.5601,4.1469,1.2127,2.5797,1.1213,1.8282,2.0437,1.543,0.0043,0.0052,0.0505,0.1985,0.0002,6.1037,6.5756]}

{"id":1142,"ended":true,"length":443,"text":"An outbreak has occurred of a virus that mimics a mild case of the common cold, but with one important side effect : those infected stop aging, permanently.\n\nThe virus, known as VACTERL0, was discovered by Prof. Yoshinori Ohsumi, of Keio University School of Medicine in Japan, in the blood of an 83-year-old patient with emphysema. The patient had been running a marathon, and apparently stopped running for no apparent reason, and suffered from breathing problems.\n\nThe virus, like many respiratory pathogens and viruses, causes an inflammation of the lungs which leads to lung damage. In this case, the lung damage had apparently progressed so far that patients had to be ventilated. Once in the hospital, the researchers noticed that the patient's body aged at a slower rate than a healthy 81-year-old man. Blood samples showed that the 83-year-old man carried an extremely low level of VACTERL0.\n\nAnother blood sample showed that the patient had a total of 30 copies of the VACTERL0 virus, where normally a patient would have only one copy of the virus. Because the amount of the virus was extremely low, it was extremely unlikely that the virus had caused the patient's aging, since it would normally take more than 300 copies of the virus to change a person's aging. On the other hand, it was very likely that this virus had affected the aging of the patient's red blood cells.\n\nIt is believed that the virus does not cross the Blood-Brain-Barrier, and so cannot affect the brain. However, since the patient had a lung infection, it is possible that the virus, by attacking the red cells of the lungs, had also damaged blood vessels in the brain. Since the red blood cells are the largest contributor to blood pressure, a viral attack on the red cells may well lead to an increase in blood pressure.\n\nSince anti-retrovirals have a tendency to worsen memory and dementia issues in HIV patients, there is an obvious interest in treating people with anti-retrovirals to see if there are any side effects.\n\nThe researchers suspect that the virus may have been caused by a tick bite, which would explain why the virus only affected the patient's lungs rather than his whole cardiovascular system. The patient has now been put on a trial of the anti-retroviral drugs dolutegravir and rilpivirine, in a bid to reverse his aging.","token_len":517,"entropy":[10.5299,3.3397,4.0106,5.474,2.8297,3.4247,1.0374,6.7968,0.0329,2.6804,5.9938,3.0739,0.1031,3.9115,3.5747,0.0755,1.3152,1.7222,4.2194,5.8465,3.3956,4.9147,0.143,7.5399,6.8869,2.0494,8.8354,8.8329,2.4827,7.9598,1.4094,1.2695,0.0021,2.067,2.3354,2.3092,2.3144,0.0855,4.6989,7.9497,7.227,6.5741,8.8677,0.762,2.7196,1.8908,2.0294,6.5947,0.4394,7.4866,2.3759,0.1552,4.6037,3.116,1.1066,1.4605,3.0902,6.0126,0.6522,0.029,4.8649,0.0052,0.0642,0.6842,1.415,0.9242,0.942,2.5322,7.7473,0.1203,3.2933,4.5865,0.0211,0.0029,0.0805,0.0003,2.771,2.629,8.1907,0.1552,0.0,0.0001,0.9648,1.6861,1.1379,1.4718,1.649,7.9777,1.2207,4.5534,2.5856,1.3589,6.5933,3.93,2.331,2.8801,5.0927,1.1089,0.0298,2.1667,2.8195,5.0079,0.8257,6.7193,0.605,0.7251,0.9296,0.0004,1.7303,2.0538,2.2006,4.7829,2.1498,4.9241,4.1555,4.7261,3.033,0.4146,2.9075,3.1127,2.7954,0.7865,0.1957,2.0362,4.1564,3.0919,0.0164,3.5404,1.8825,0.9342,2.9908,2.5662,0.3622,0.1356,0.8485,5.0359,2.4366,4.3914,5.6926,5.9181,3.7923,1.4605,0.1951,5.2626,1.8325,1.9741,1.416,7.7368,0.0465,1.8089,6.7128,4.1733,0.6803,2.5136,0.0957,0.6393,5.2058,3.7452,0.6968,0.8235,0.7806,1.1871,3.1185,11.5156,4.0927,0.9395,2.9711,0.1852,0.4528,4.5965,1.8632,10.7662,0.3344,0.0155,0.0056,0.0016,1.88,0.6468,8.9381,2.6699,2.9436,0.517,0.8941,9.3214,0.046,0.0011,0.0455,0.0004,1.3926,7.8134,3.2724,3.7019,2.7326,1.2514,0.0026,0.9152,0.035,0.0104,0.0021,0.0428,1.381,0.4378,0.0003,5.5859,7.1053,1.0453,2.105,0.3835,0.6089,1.6384,0.8173,1.8843,5.4843,0.4164,4.7696,5.8095,0.2261,0.691,4.2253,0.0162,0.001,0.0011,0.113,0.3672,1.2994,7.5896,8.1004,2.969,4.4386,1.3342,0.8448,2.3546,1.1519,0.353,1.856,0.637,0.2173,0.6041,5.9082,1.0211,5.7791,0.0832,2.4183,0.1936,2.0053,4.4412,0.6088,0.2292,1.9291,0.913,5.175,1.528,0.1711,0.6917,3.3387,2.2033,4.2571,0.8191,1.8211,0.766,4.5902,2.5324,4.2324,1.6659,2.5085,3.6199,3.5526,3.9443,0.2634,6.5915,2.6927,0.567,0.7901,0.1319,0.4377,6.0066,2.1761,0.7692,0.0164,3.8359,1.1183,6.3456,0.1156,0.1815,0.0083,0.0042,3.3269,0.8798,2.7003,0.8298,0.0316,3.583,1.2199,1.5419,3.5843,0.7794,5.3839,0.4299,0.7123,0.87,1.6418,9.0001,0.0527,0.1415,1.0042,0.354,0.0004,4.2412,0.9724,2.9137,0.0473,0.9748,1.594,5.3551,0.1785,6.1271,0.4893,6.2904,0.4991,1.6214,6.0939,10.9463,0.0851,2.9194,2.6146,4.3965,4.7981,4.6106,0.7605,2.7174,1.4427,2.0142,0.0141,4.6165,0.996,2.5345,1.7156,2.3212,6.4925,1.0026,0.5979,1.6895,1.2565,1.4567,0.0671,1.1172,0.5849,4.5591,4.5313,5.9148,0.5999,2.4631,1.4355,1.9736,0.2718,1.8418,0.1812,2.7301,3.6823,3.2716,4.7439,0.4084,1.3558,0.2947,1.5915,0.5672,4.7876,0.7746,3.0836,0.9081,0.24,1.5818,2.8815,5.463,6.6925,0.1489,4.3375,2.2645,0.4603,3.6928,4.7133,2.075,1.5075,0.5697,1.1895,1.3259,3.0696,5.3191,4.1953,0.0135,2.304,1.2233,0.0534,0.6056,0.0348,0.722,0.5685,0.0004,5.1351,8.9453,0.1104,4.167,0.0947,3.0476,0.1914,1.9477,4.0317,4.2936,0.0781,5.9734,7.5651,2.3988,4.8782,7.2305,2.0782,8.3395,1.698,0.1222,3.4216,0.6957,3.0329,3.7343,6.2927,0.191,3.8823,4.0331,0.5119,3.9106,0.0011,0.0211,0.0,1.0716,0.0097,3.6821,3.7284,0.3916,2.7639,1.3824,0.9393,3.0947,0.1254,0.6928,1.549,0.0004,2.1777,2.7994,4.8924,0.1001,1.211,1.3263,1.5328,1.6253,1.6267,4.115,0.0651,1.1912,8.5614,1.5,1.1853,1.4184,3.5112,3.7234,0.5791,1.1572,1.8746,4.7775,2.9284,0.8158,4.8511,0.1627,3.1424,4.7079,0.0051,1.7144,5.0326,7.3417,0.0166,0.1872,2.3586,3.7626,3.4685,4.3905,1.0926,5.2202,0.3713,1.191,4.6134,1.7067,2.5425,1.2674,0.0013,0.0423,0.0001,0.3972,2.2806,5.6201,7.867,6.3033,1.6522,0.087,0.616,4.0549,3.9073,4.5203,2.9332,0.3586,5.9185,1.0991,4.1511,2.7332,4.8575,0.0075,4.4276,2.8918,2.1804,0.4104]}

Necromancy by the way is \"the technique of using magic to bring life or death to beings\".  It also says nothing about \"animating corpses\", just that it relates to living beings as well.   One would be like calling lightning'magic lightning'.\nAre you actually this misinformed?\nI am now, because I thought that necromancy was the use of any magic to bring dead things to life.   You said that \"technomancy is the *theory* of magic that is focused on technology\".   Technomancy is not a theory, it is a practice and a way of using magic. If it was a theory, it would not be a practice at all.\nJust a practice of animating corpses. In which case it is tech and not magic.","token_len":517,"entropy":[8.8766,3.9112,1.2551,2.3739,8.9183,3.7042,0.0436,0.3149,8.6246,0.1065,0.0072,3.4479,4.4579,5.9784,0.8313,6.3278,4.7625,0.2665,6.9374,1.2446,3.6761,1.8363,1.0523,3.4559,1.2119,7.7979,2.0494,1.547,2.8557,3.5219,9.1148,2.3774,3.6658,2.0234,4.1703,2.6088,1.177,0.7029,3.3714,0.9882,1.2875,8.1158,5.0689,5.6433,3.1474,1.7077,1.9812,1.3067,11.4883,0.0266,0.15,1.1614,3.758,1.2662,0.6667,0.4485,1.9081,0.0153,0.0009,0.8486,2.2158,0.2625,0.7206,0.1047,0.0636,3.7919,0.0024,0.0006,0.2029,1.724,3.5914,6.0938,3.6431,0.2991,1.6682,5.1525,1.2453,1.73,4.3954,6.9917,8.0916,0.1414,0.0243,3.4512,3.0948,0.0041,0.0006,0.8345,1.9465,3.8806,5.3941,10.3429,2.2388,5.9572,0.0073,0.079,0.886,3.9378,0.7981,1.3343,2.9369,0.0732,0.0133,0.8791,2.0363,5.7664,3.3893,0.0213,0.6937,1.7003,5.1517,1.3897,2.2981,5.5774,1.1369,0.3692,4.8211,9.2543,3.5213,3.4606,5.2939,3.2447,0.4211,6.0004,7.4633,4.3533,3.901,0.4738,2.5625,0.0112,0.0059,0.7267,2.2527,2.2289,4.2193,1.2283,4.7127,1.8931,0.8748,3.7098,0.4031,0.9983,1.7429,0.0561,0.0123,0.6563,2.8383,4.0979,0.2445,0.5812,1.1848,4.9985,7.2738,1.5612,5.4588,4.7566,1.2928,3.8731,5.9464,0.7533,3.7561,5.1186,6.4396,0.5132,0.1673,4.4196,6.1271,5.4972,1.8363,6.1601,3.9803,2.2224,1.6471,4.9347,1.7701,7.5369,0.0151,0.0114,4.507,2.4826,4.5822,8.3882,1.08,2.4738,3.6094,0.839,0.7788,1.5061,0.0396,0.0103,0.714,5.9521,3.7334,5.9848,1.6585,1.2966,4.1223,2.8646,6.702,0.3399,4.1017,2.2622,2.3497,1.7061,2.7881,3.3818,6.5049,1.2635,0.2973,5.0801,0.2205,0.1403,1.8334,2.4056,4.4876,6.3829,4.9273,6.7677,1.336,1.2943,8.8373,0.393,3.0233,0.7983,7.7083,6.066,4.0743,0.7262,3.9138,1.2097,1.5215,7.54,0.1574,0.2897,0.7441,2.6653,3.5152,0.7085,3.1875,0.6064,0.2187,7.2807,0.0053,0.0044,2.4213,1.9919,8.0295,0.1077,6.1978,0.6046,0.5946,2.9872,0.8735,2.6283,0.4916,3.4539,5.3521,0.7502,6.8246,3.8401,2.8394,1.2209,1.0424,4.3072,0.706,2.9807,3.5196,2.879,0.0064,0.8627,1.5,0.4696,7.9667,1.1012,1.0472,4.9426,0.1337,1.1568,2.9365,8.3881,3.666,5.7133,0.5505,5.6121,3.6632,2.8871,1.2337,2.2794,0.0062,0.0144,2.4388,4.1965,0.0082,0.015,0.9919,4.421,0.6298,4.0436,2.5478,1.2867,8.2889,5.6629,1.5436,3.9243,4.2371,3.4733,0.0002,4.6313,0.5172,3.0334,0.804,0.0006,0.1889,0.0535,0.0891,0.2185,1.1033,1.432,0.0931,0.0077,0.473,2.2588,4.4225,0.0367,1.5319,3.6449,0.6883,5.6946,1.601,4.2641,1.2968,0.7002,4.0922,2.1397,0.0005,1.5932,2.4746,2.2862,7.5126,0.0131,4.9818,4.7282,1.1197,5.0754,1.4482,7.4156,1.1551,0.4444,0.8133,2.4353,2.6269,8.1693,0.0091,0.0128,7.9063,3.2148,0.0621,0.6321,3.7232,2.0055,4.8607,0.7689,2.2903,1.3731,0.5306,5.4769,5.0815,3.6832,2.2378,0.8872,4.8893,1.2725,1.7266,3.0204,4.2606,5.9747,4.7743,0.1427,2.6309,6.7411,2.3122,1.692,2.5171,3.5589,1.8022,1.1838,7.9549,0.4169,5.8932,1.6673,3.3065,0.3257,0.426,1.9109,1.6665,6.3423,3.8824,3.5877,6.3096,5.211,7.2086,14.6763,8.2658,4.2795,10.0635,1.0062,7.5219,0.7223,5.415,8.4754,9.1723,0.6543,0.6132,0.8383,2.1858,2.332,7.0403,3.1855,4.2158,0.8205,4.8645,2.3746,2.8631,0.0092,0.0204,0.7805,2.7763,5.245,0.0413,7.3188,3.0526,2.0106,2.6911,4.5584,2.4766,1.0694,0.0261,0.6632,1.8715,1.0705,3.7813,4.1423,1.2722,3.3745,2.8136,0.3503,0.006,1.2097,1.3562,10.3385,6.1006,0.378,1.061,0.0805,0.2273,0.2541,0.3114,0.1653,0.0027,0.1587,0.6263,0.9614,0.8887,2.1538,0.0956,0.0151,0.3902,2.7836,2.4944,5.0147,2.5621,0.8084,0.7701,1.241,3.1154,3.4413,2.7851,2.354,0.433,2.2446,1.0884,0.9318,4.5459,2.1679,2.6261,2.1556,2.1013,2.5803,1.4649,0.2789,2.7314,0.6631,2.2894,3.3317,3.132,0.0059,0.4757,1.6515,6.1007,3.2385,10.0413,3.1153,8.5561,0.0191,0.966,1.2194,5.3204,5.4674,0.0798,2.1983,1.4934,4.9118,3.0434,1.6307,1.9014,0.372]}
{"id":4800,"ended":true,"length":489,"text":"A mysterious entity decides to bring peace and equality to humanity by force. The world is informed that in two weeks everybody over the age of ten will have their conscience transferred to another random human body anywhere in the world. This shuffle will then repeat every 24 hours.\n\nThe government decides to use the chaos created by the random distribution to impose control over the population. The government puts together an Army made of people who have no choice but to participate.\n\nIn spite of the best efforts of the government, people are still escaping the program. The government starts sending out teams to find and destroy the individuals.\n\nThis is set in 2065 and is based loosely on the real world. Some of the things that I liked were that it isn\u2019t futuristic and the technology is fairly realistic. The team that I had the most fun playing was a team made up of two brawler type people, a tech specialist who has a thing for guns, and an environmental scientist.\n\nThere are a number of ways that you can use your characters, but the one I liked most was in the form of puzzles where you needed your environmental scientist to go in and find out what was going on. The puzzles where generally easy enough where you could complete them without killing everyone in the same area.\n\nI wasn\u2019t particularly enjoying being in a team with the brawler \/ tech guy. My issue is that he will use his power more than his ability to get out of a situation and it just feels unneeded at times. He also tended to die more than the other members and they would die quite often, which is just annoying for me.\n\nDespite that, it is still a fun little RPG. It\u2019s short ( a game like this is better in shorter bursts ) and it has some things that actually worked quite well, such as you could talk to people while moving ( it was easy to click off of the screen ) to see the dialogue options.\n\nThe art is good and can vary depending upon the time you are playing around in the world of \u201cYour character is being transferred to a new body\u201d. One of my favorite parts of the game was going into an area and seeing something new that no one else had.\n\nFinal verdict\n\nIf you have enough patience to deal with what can be a frustrating experience, you will enjoy the game. It\u2019s not as polished as something like an AAA RPG would be but it got the job done and didn\u2019t leave a bad taste in my mouth.","token_len":518,"entropy":[10.7193,5.4853,8.6329,0.1737,4.718,4.8948,2.1973,6.69,0.2816,3.8948,2.5221,7.162,0.7487,2.2178,4.2224,0.9448,8.5561,1.74,5.5418,6.8878,2.5068,8.8393,7.7436,1.4551,0.0458,0.0107,3.3523,0.3599,2.5522,2.1578,8.4732,7.5222,0.368,4.1574,8.7173,3.4771,3.9871,11.0032,0.7357,0.0558,0.8914,0.419,2.9312,12.9436,2.3985,5.6156,5.2916,3.8102,5.339,0.1296,1.3265,1.8113,0.043,2.1353,6.2469,3.8617,0.5114,2.8196,1.533,4.6514,3.4052,0.1675,0.7633,4.9644,6.5314,1.7932,5.8314,5.0234,0.7843,1.0152,1.2136,0.7725,1.5492,2.3953,5.6664,3.3986,2.2141,6.4322,7.4688,1.2485,3.7904,1.2674,2.7392,2.9108,3.4211,0.2228,0.0263,4.1662,2.2388,2.6661,0.0002,3.0779,6.2246,0.0066,1.2314,6.1903,0.6576,0.1052,0.7174,1.5902,0.5078,4.1034,1.4374,1.9502,9.9012,1.9018,7.9207,0.8596,1.7774,1.5592,5.27,4.4076,2.0336,5.655,1.5604,3.23,1.9384,2.3779,0.8925,5.5111,2.4218,1.5504,0.0002,3.7224,1.2695,7.3195,1.0558,5.7932,4.9275,2.0693,2.3162,3.3357,5.3973,0.2528,0.8066,3.9566,0.9479,1.1052,5.215,1.2545,0.1982,4.6471,1.3587,5.648,5.5243,2.8859,5.0535,1.3622,6.6165,16.9542,7.2519,2.0062,8.3847,2.0474,3.449,5.5266,1.1633,4.871,5.0396,0.6673,2.1244,6.1612,2.3514,2.9174,4.413,3.8146,0.6657,0.737,2.9083,1.1806,2.895,2.8344,3.6698,0.4087,0.1648,4.1635,7.7281,6.6803,5.438,3.5674,2.4725,2.2745,7.3369,4.3737,2.8136,3.2338,1.7025,7.2769,0.1663,4.2288,1.1638,0.3257,2.1606,6.7624,2.7619,1.6795,1.1536,0.0003,3.2263,1.0331,1.9276,2.3829,0.0079,4.8093,1.8266,2.2751,0.2826,3.7433,3.4769,4.1113,2.4421,1.3356,1.8807,3.7756,1.3406,1.5923,0.8409,0.4821,3.9077,1.1246,2.7746,0.0186,7.3223,3.2051,0.3251,6.1521,5.9117,10.393,1.1749,0.279,4.2182,3.5068,0.9474,2.8958,2.4136,1.0259,3.0607,1.0209,0.0299,0.8351,2.0092,2.1236,6.1216,8.8374,3.2003,3.8619,6.9766,1.1191,2.1323,5.8259,1.0776,2.7252,5.3889,3.2045,2.1231,0.5764,5.6454,1.8511,0.6629,0.856,0.0002,2.4507,5.2591,3.4995,0.5991,0.0077,3.1379,5.7694,5.8688,2.789,1.5833,2.601,2.0863,2.7436,3.336,0.2309,11.3606,3.8673,3.5351,1.9069,4.7413,7.1389,2.8002,0.4942,4.0665,6.6876,5.3386,1.2838,4.4322,4.479,1.4434,3.1403,4.3694,0.8855,4.2489,3.4712,0.2005,1.7813,2.0068,2.2704,3.8905,3.4682,3.019,5.0601,4.5463,4.4817,0.8853,0.1601,3.3551,2.5447,8.5462,0.031,6.0417,4.1304,2.451,2.3584,1.2389,2.5702,3.4203,4.6425,3.1849,2.7067,5.9237,1.3758,2.7072,1.474,1.8955,3.5308,2.9362,3.8344,0.9607,0.2199,0.6632,0.0002,5.713,2.8248,0.5139,2.5087,2.0889,2.4087,1.4136,0.7333,4.7308,5.0923,1.333,1.7997,8.9294,0.1846,0.3244,6.3449,4.7912,9.6901,4.6629,4.5159,1.2046,1.781,5.8111,3.9396,5.7616,4.8552,4.0412,0.4228,1.6899,1.6369,2.0904,4.8443,1.1236,6.9838,2.3969,4.5596,0.033,3.1237,1.6612,0.0028,5.4902,3.2707,5.3901,0.2827,2.2666,4.4963,4.8335,5.2802,4.1113,2.2821,3.8269,0.5102,6.5355,7.0239,2.929,2.1598,2.3157,3.4576,4.7198,3.388,2.9739,5.4433,4.9052,2.1824,0.9828,0.0004,1.905,4.2066,1.2246,3.2496,1.4703,6.7118,6.1016,2.978,4.7129,1.0786,3.0958,2.5064,1.5075,0.634,7.2393,3.3854,0.9017,1.5776,3.8824,10.8562,4.0485,7.8742,5.397,2.7315,6.8313,7.0538,0.7323,1.5186,2.0265,0.9417,5.3398,8.26,2.2957,5.5865,0.8254,2.4607,0.6,1.7085,0.5269,0.6102,0.1385,1.6343,6.8964,2.7492,3.5524,1.6638,1.8744,1.7055,5.1518,3.6797,2.6376,5.5749,0.1528,1.5894,1.8859,3.9665,1.5156,0.0003,5.9282,5.1657,1.5589,0.0002,3.5022,0.2433,2.3881,7.3112,2.353,3.0797,7.3852,0.0051,5.7599,5.3189,1.2572,1.3299,2.6738,2.0371,0.5886,1.7973,1.3342,1.5881,1.9276,0.4069,0.5735,1.5155,2.5444,0.0988,0.0197,2.8603,3.2518,5.301,0.28,5.7144,0.1932,5.4089,6.4414,3.356,6.1822,0.8455,3.1779,0.557,6.7136,2.2479,0.0616,0.0012,1.436,6.2082,0.7964,0.4388,0.0113,3.9363,2.45,1.4352,0.2887,0.1322,0.5379,0.0076,0.1529]}

For a moment or two, the world feels real again.\nI've also been trying to read more recently as work piles up to suffocate me. Or is it just that I'm a glutton for punishment? I'm a writer and editor, but have decided to take a break and see how the rest of the year works out. At this point, that really would be all right.\nMy day starts at 7am, which should be a nice time for work, but it's not. I have to get to work by 7.10 and it takes the full 42-odd minutes to get there. That gives me exactly ten minutes to do half a dozen things I need to. Then I get to work and spend the first two or three hours staring at a screen. I know I should get up and do other things, but I'm too tired and, when I do get up, most times I don't feel like going on to the next task. So, then a few hours go by watching the sky or listening to the birds or talking to the dog. There's a song on the radio this morning that I find endlessly compelling. The words are so familiar, but to this day I don't know who wrote them. I'll put on my coat and go out and stand around. I'll keep standing until time for the bus goes by. Then I'll turn the song off and get on with my day.\nThe sun is still shining. The sunsets in the last few days have been beautiful, like a scene out of a movie. No clouds, no rain, nothing. Not until the breeze begins to pick up, and then, suddenly, everything is lit like a spotlight. Then it's gone. The sun has faded from view and, because of the way the evening shadows have come in, it's time to stop. This is all I have in a day, and every night it has to be done again. The rain will come. It must. And I'll be standing out in it.","token_len":520,"entropy":[7.9729,1.1158,2.147,8.0618,0.9083,3.3123,4.1093,11.177,3.7148,6.7774,1.3957,1.3746,3.9338,1.9818,4.8356,2.8169,6.1521,4.2613,1.4974,4.8431,2.7594,0.149,1.2636,5.9543,5.758,3.5505,4.7674,0.001,0.5858,1.9633,5.8727,3.2639,6.0504,3.3795,1.3588,1.7026,0.1168,0.5105,7.4352,4.1293,3.6702,3.7396,0.6858,4.9463,4.2496,3.7302,2.3939,0.3758,5.29,0.8169,3.7956,7.8888,3.8904,2.2021,3.7619,1.9587,4.9958,2.1545,4.6311,2.9866,6.8692,2.3407,1.3389,5.393,0.5961,0.3246,7.3824,1.0262,6.0584,5.8923,1.4038,1.8449,1.1215,7.2215,3.6814,1.2824,1.3739,3.1381,0.7465,1.6305,5.0983,2.7418,2.6842,0.4474,1.5091,0.5375,2.8196,4.8856,3.4284,5.0403,4.0553,3.2933,3.0837,1.2081,2.2488,8.242,2.839,1.3854,1.3394,3.1796,5.3365,0.6301,3.0262,4.1804,2.211,0.4634,4.3692,2.1659,2.9592,4.9181,0.1829,0.3038,2.6764,3.4563,2.933,5.0164,5.789,0.6983,2.3199,2.0622,2.8861,5.1165,1.8271,4.0391,0.1664,2.5339,3.0954,5.1349,4.9326,9.2292,8.4499,0.1235,4.2296,11.1939,0.436,0.4606,0.6481,6.0224,5.9599,0.5377,2.1276,2.4026,0.8497,1.2911,3.5145,8.5952,0.1178,0.8879,2.3485,0.5899,1.8315,1.888,2.7964,3.5074,2.651,6.552,1.1668,2.5645,5.1422,6.1234,0.8043,2.8951,1.2562,1.7017,2.4831,4.2307,2.1827,2.3412,4.603,0.0442,0.7221,3.7857,4.6785,0.2641,0.2308,5.6201,2.241,0.2549,0.3598,5.7053,6.1106,5.7687,0.6544,5.3353,5.1877,0.5442,1.0933,4.0955,5.6428,3.3297,2.356,2.2813,2.2296,1.5318,3.9682,5.9797,0.7583,2.8512,3.3271,1.7198,2.0524,4.2039,1.9983,1.107,1.9878,1.0318,1.8999,0.6985,1.2062,3.1244,1.6482,2.3378,2.6153,0.4598,2.6085,2.0379,2.5839,4.5754,4.097,3.7553,2.8811,5.3025,5.2331,8.6999,3.5952,5.385,3.198,1.0334,0.823,1.9817,0.2838,4.0221,5.6864,0.1568,7.5527,5.1255,0.5706,0.6892,3.4263,5.252,1.9408,1.5513,2.0757,3.3488,3.4462,0.0716,3.2959,4.3045,0.8477,2.4626,1.1117,1.0136,2.352,5.6063,1.2226,4.4111,2.6339,2.5935,0.0246,0.1889,4.6296,0.2372,2.006,2.2774,1.4998,1.6672,4.1216,1.28,4.2087,2.9941,2.6294,1.4765,2.4969,5.9085,0.3783,0.8709,0.3018,0.8376,1.4309,2.7235,1.4016,2.6735,6.232,4.2648,0.2889,2.0667,2.4492,0.2662,0.3464,6.9857,6.4018,0.7563,2.6402,0.0006,4.0539,1.0725,3.9777,4.1342,4.3736,2.3129,0.2578,2.3704,0.3375,3.9178,2.0637,5.5219,5.9156,1.3494,0.76,3.778,0.0164,10.1777,2.3537,6.3789,3.8239,3.9228,0.0309,1.4666,4.6606,2.0643,4.2144,0.5388,1.0743,3.7769,0.8101,5.0135,0.7076,1.7933,7.0784,3.8046,0.6346,1.3174,6.5581,0.9848,2.5357,1.4248,4.8279,7.1535,4.8206,0.6789,3.5774,5.1548,1.4832,2.8557,4.2507,1.3987,3.7028,6.0063,5.3627,0.3407,0.8332,1.9342,0.0004,1.4002,3.869,1.0998,0.3643,0.4004,1.7621,4.9058,5.4727,3.5701,1.18,5.1615,0.6905,1.9112,2.762,1.8262,7.3848,2.8387,3.0096,1.5752,2.5523,5.0101,5.845,3.6351,6.8125,4.5639,1.7651,5.5722,5.9584,0.4941,0.9865,2.4892,0.5187,1.1973,3.6626,3.3449,7.6504,2.1724,0.8045,3.673,2.4387,3.5082,0.5959,0.7073,0.2742,0.5852,2.8306,5.0027,1.8256,3.1471,1.8333,1.8362,2.015,3.0689,5.7186,3.823,0.8626,6.6356,1.0929,1.8839,1.5727,0.9329,3.6968,1.564,4.443,1.7617,5.761,2.5521,0.0315,0.8041,1.2381,0.6493,5.6206,3.6537,1.0644,0.7806,2.4889,0.7838,2.7964,0.7826,4.888,4.4735,1.8566,8.2693,5.2756,0.147,3.5776,0.1371,2.4482,1.1775,1.6625,2.6074,2.6432,0.0844,3.4575,1.5342,5.1212,4.9581,0.7929,5.1497,0.539,3.8541,2.2317,0.9178,3.2508,0.5669,2.2701,1.9538,2.7488,4.4643,3.4416,2.0275,1.8442,3.5129,5.0852,1.1622,1.1083,3.8372,0.8959,6.0985,6.0552,3.7749,4.061,2.332,0.4343,1.6472,0.5846,3.8513,0.3595,4.8733,1.4898,4.4535,0.7054,4.4213,2.0045,2.0798,4.039,5.3917,2.8487,1.69,1.2286,5.4775,4.3347,3.4774,3.9137,2.5319,1.2372,2.2612,5.3409,0.2489,3.3864,5.0229,3.6774,2.1482,1.9084,2.9761,4.8202,1.7332,3.4304,2.0848,2.3879,2.014,4.4011,5.0868,1.4324,5.3242,1.1297]}

The children of the Fire King are being trained for war. One Fire Prince is told by his mother, the Queen, to stay away from the fighting. His twin brother, Fire Dragon, wants to go to the battlefield to fight.\n\nThe twins are not aware of the evil that is slowly taking over them. One day, the Queen calls her sons home. The King has died and the Fire Dragon has become King. Now to stop the evil, the Fire King has created a hero named Shiro, the Wind Hero. He is to wield the Fire Bow, which can cast fire at enemies. Shiro is also very powerful in magic, but he is weak in physical strength. He decides to ask the Prince for help.\n\nShiro asks the Fire Dragon where the Fire Bow is. The Fire Dragon goes to Shiro to give the Fire Bow. All the other Fire Dragons want the Fire Bow; however, this Dragon shows up, but he is in flames. However, Shiro still receives the bow. The dragon tells the Fire Dragon that the bow can save the world from the Dark Lord and its evil minions. But, this Fire Bow is not working, but for only a few minutes. Fire Dragon tells Shiro that the Fire Bow is needed for the final battle between Fire and Water.\n\nShiro leaves to get the power that the Fire Bow needs.

Finally, the Fire King comes to him. He tells of the time when his brother gave up everything to fight for the Fire Kingdom. His brother was the Fire Dragon, but he is gone. His brother gave up his life in the fight. The kingdom still needs him. He says he must give Shiro the Fire Bow. Soon, Shiro finds out he has the same power that his brother had.\n\nIn the final battle with the Dark Lord, Shiro is able to defeat it. He throws a Fire Arrow at the Dark Lord's heart. This makes the Dark Lord fall and dies.

Our loss in killed, wounded\nand captured in the two divisions of the Corps was over\none thousand and six hundred men. The First Corps\nwith four divisions under General Hancock, being on\nthe right flank of the Army, was able to use the natural\ndefensive lines which had been prepared during the\nnight. At the second and third attacks both Confederate\nattacks were repulsed by the right flank of our Army,\nand the losses were very light. A battery under\nGeneral Early on horseback had also been pressed forward\nup to the railroad. Early\u2019s battery had\nfired on the First Corps troops on the night of the 12th\nuntil late in the morning of the 13th, and had been severely\nbarrassed near the cemetery. During the whole of\nthe attack there is not a single charge on the part of\nthe Confederates which has been satisfactorily accounted\nfor.\n\nThe 2d, 3d, and 4th Divisions in the Second Corps\nbegan to move at the end of June from the point of their\narrival, on the left and rear, to a position near the\nnew bridge, which was an important point gained since\nit carried water and supplies from the Wabash River.\n\nThe First Corps remained in position, on the left,\nabout four miles from here, making every effort to use\nits right flank whenever possible.\n\nJuly, 1861","token_len":527,"entropy":[8.8945,8.0913,2.4709,7.2261,4.912,7.0758,1.0784,1.1122,3.8998,0.1645,4.0943,0.0004,12.0961,1.674,0.0005,4.3156,7.2222,3.2649,13.9271,7.5376,6.9293,2.2609,5.6441,4.6072,7.0937,20.2056,3.1479,4.9388,0.4339,4.5202,2.6467,2.024,0.7045,5.2513,5.6988,3.5616,3.1274,1.7276,4.5043,17.5361,4.7124,5.7029,2.8976,1.3319,3.1872,0.6254,0.0188,1.1136,0.975,4.6863,6.2617,4.0626,16.7454,3.267,0.371,4.3712,4.257,4.6563,0.6835,2.3102,6.4155,0.8164,1.9682,0.8459,1.222,15.2734,4.1892,0.0136,3.3439,5.1227,1.0512,0.748,5.8954,2.759,5.9266,0.0177,4.687,1.5744,1.7811,5.5245,6.4518,6.39,6.6713,0.6093,11.661,1.5428,3.0318,1.9218,2.1718,6.24,2.0249,3.9127,0.7191,3.1374,1.0107,1.4127,2.4677,4.9826,0.8605,4.0184,7.8411,5.3754,1.6183,4.6994,1.826,0.4302,7.4936,8.1587,0.3089,5.6318,0.5161,0.7421,1.5013,4.4725,4.1905,1.7759,3.5147,5.009,11.8925,0.922,0.119,4.0955,3.7433,3.3838,5.3716,0.1083,2.7345,0.9316,1.1067,1.845,1.7018,5.2695,4.6316,1.2767,0.4131,3.3306,5.3332,5.3139,1.8558,3.9786,3.3571,6.1823,2.0632,1.6873,6.1363,4.1574,5.4753,0.226,14.9908,1.3595,3.6523,1.4773,1.0855,1.4691,0.0437,0.8661,1.2746,0.0652,5.1927,11.6763,7.2307,0.217,6.0572,2.6342,5.222,1.5594,3.0062,0.9926,0.0703,3.8576,6.0694,1.8446,6.5772,4.6024,0.8833,2.0182,3.4083,2.2953,2.3162,3.6427,1.1262,1.7795,4.1986,0.9558,7.3853,1.4014,7.3623,0.0589,0.0046,3.2571,3.9183,3.6909,1.9568,4.0984,1.4955,4.4791,1.9786,7.9068,1.4067,6.8408,1.3676,2.5539,5.3453,2.8768,0.5785,1.2574,4.3387,2.7682,4.6622,0.3834,4.5974,2.7001,0.0173,3.2134,1.1386,6.2627,0.1716,2.7915,2.5407,3.2205,2.7442,5.7818,1.0045,4.8273,2.8159,5.4513,2.5866,7.9159,5.4911,2.2314,3.7196,4.3724,0.6528,3.3509,1.3648,1.3407,4.028,1.1004,4.6439,4.8126,2.8749,0.305,6.7167,1.0676,5.3372,2.494,11.3153,1.3374,2.6984,3.9471,0.681,1.5543,0.4846,1.8434,5.3735,2.5048,1.4389,11.9909,6.5107,1.8828,4.096,2.2794,7.3536,1.8332,6.8952,4.1782,2.0797,6.8419,1.4736,3.3494,0.9037,0.2302,4.6846,1.2827,2.1874,4.2189,0.3232,6.0708,1.526,7.7845,1.3807,7.2912,1.755,2.6477,3.819,2.1499,0.306,6.2037,5.5918,0.2845,2.7592,6.0177,1.728,4.0657,1.9627,4.9878,2.6635,0.3331,5.898,5.5749,4.0434,1.8134,3.1024,0.676,4.5861,0.0034,0.0018,1.8194,1.3486,5.6084,0.897,0.5689,3.5596,3.6472,1.4602,0.4887,7.1832,1.4424,5.0847,1.4333,4.4878,5.4847,0.4396,4.994,5.6533,5.2603,1.9649,2.5467,9.7287,4.44,7.152,0.0571,3.3536,5.3672,0.9496,5.5698,3.6058,0.832,8.591,1.723,0.6424,2.9791,1.6979,7.4057,14.7948,0.3306,2.5237,5.0735,1.6277,3.7958,10.7677,2.0549,0.827,4.8553,0.7328,7.1701,2.5401,0.492,7.1642,0.7442,1.1869,4.0527,0.0585,2.3687,12.1159,5.5157,1.3358,0.0439,0.9433,2.2755,0.6838,0.3152,0.0204,1.1857,1.5027,2.559,1.8557,6.5968,0.6258,7.3773,8.4834,0.0092,6.7454,0.4668,4.5687,1.0989,4.6742,0.691,3.9252,1.2124,0.937,1.0252,3.5688,4.3749,5.9961,2.285,0.6732,0.176,7.163,3.3061,0.6018,3.9154,0.0437,2.0199,0.4912,3.5733,0.0065,3.206,2.4963,1.0132,7.5188,0.0007,0.0001,5.516,2.3516,3.4592,0.5938,1.4322,0.0003,1.2907,4.5265,0.0365,2.9889,0.476,0.0376,0.6939,0.3234,0.273,0.0272,2.7537,0.0193,4.0186,0.6956,3.1959,1.5705,2.2543,16.0413,0.147,1.696,2.9314,3.7812,2.0038,3.7246,0.0221,2.0063,3.8996,0.8199,5.6332,1.7514,4.8046,0.1726,10.2927,0.3617,2.8964,3.5687,0.4168,2.5449,3.1947,5.649,1.9275,1.2594,3.6513,1.4272,3.3481,0.4285,1.8898,9.5926,3.5639,1.9928,2.1805,1.3714,6.005,3.0071,1.9127,10.8511,7.132,0.7605,9.6164,7.2529,7.2768,2.1721,2.2295,2.1431,0.6355,7.4723,4.7382,0.0502,0.9251,1.3809,0.8176,0.0002,1.1823,3.9887,0.4629,6.0269,1.3379,2.4192,2.7398,3.6342,0.2088,1.478,1.3021,2.5171,13.2245,3.2385,0.3698,1.064,5.8637,0.7969,7.043,6.0728,1.1731,0.4789,5.8899,1.1469,15.7065,2.6466,0.423,8.6734,0.5174,0.9953,1.7591,0.0002,9.0223,5.0055,8.751]}
{"id":4584,"ended":true,"length":492,"text":"The world wakes up one morning to find that any photo of a cat, digital or print has been altered. In place of the feline is something else and its quite troubling. Photos are even altered in realtime. Cat pictures no longer exist.\n\nThe cat is a common sight on the internet. Cats are adorable and they can sometimes even be smart. It is thought that a cat can recognize itself in mirrors. As if that is not disturbing enough cats now have a tendency to be super friendly. We are so close to losing a cat.\n\nCat pictures are one of the best, most beloved and most powerful ways to document and archive life on earth and cat photos are one of the first means of communication we humans have. Cats also act as an extension of the human imagination. A cat will often act in manners and scenarios a human will only dare to imagine. To have our cats replaced is very saddening and disturbing to say the least.\n\nWhy? Because cats make the world a much more playful and fun place. They lift the human heart.\n\nYou can\u2019t argue with that.\n\nWe don\u2019t want you to lose that.\n\nSo please resist the urge to take a picture of your cat and don\u2019t give the feline away. Have you noticed that every time you take a picture of your cat. the cat is always looking at where it is going to appear in the picture. Then you see how it turns around and the look appears to be that of surprise as if to say why are you doing this \u201d it\u2019s just a picture!\u201d You can almost hear it say to you \u201d I don\u2019t want to be a part of the next photo you are about to take!\u201d\n\nA cat will never have a clue you are photographing it. It only has a hunch and it feels so funny when you act as if taking a picture will shock it and frighten it. Its a shame because you are the one that is losing something \u201d ME \u201c.\n\nSo you have a cat that just loves being photographed. Your pet loves being captured in an image and even if you do not post the photograph. the cat still knows you took one because its looking where it is going to appear and acting like you will not be able to capture it. If you are not photographing the cat just let it be. it likes it this way. Don\u2019t make your pet a part of the next picture you are ready to take or the next story of your life.","token_len":528,"entropy":[6.1108,8.6572,0.1322,3.6977,1.175,1.5396,1.6095,1.2463,7.2156,8.1586,1.1211,1.7131,4.8817,3.3057,11.9,0.8016,5.5962,4.9129,0.4541,3.6862,1.2362,3.6947,8.0699,0.0276,1.1866,6.006,0.0618,6.175,6.7567,2.4163,5.6629,5.038,9.8033,7.3542,0.8687,7.6117,2.1154,6.3609,3.1798,2.0582,3.4667,4.3366,1.4336,7.5482,3.9618,6.4483,0.0582,2.1917,1.4074,1.9061,0.002,2.3752,3.4296,1.9345,2.822,6.6219,2.1138,2.1052,1.2546,1.8337,1.1846,5.3685,0.8883,6.898,1.4555,3.4772,3.2804,4.7255,3.5919,1.1438,7.8291,0.9113,3.4612,1.515,5.4824,0.2915,3.5982,0.972,1.9689,4.9196,6.3411,2.4039,7.5875,1.4574,4.9581,4.6013,2.3705,2.292,0.8859,4.3086,0.0116,4.916,5.3873,1.2797,1.6122,5.6427,0.0439,3.306,5.5017,4.7882,1.0374,4.3405,2.2771,3.8756,4.1747,0.2532,6.2481,2.6163,0.6969,1.5109,0.892,0.0002,4.5124,3.3083,1.0316,4.9958,0.2963,0.1821,3.3881,5.3058,1.4958,5.561,1.2671,0.889,4.4425,3.3092,0.6105,6.6664,3.1979,6.1644,4.6082,1.752,2.3549,3.7028,6.4899,1.7132,0.7806,2.1902,0.0814,0.0736,4.9167,5.1932,1.0642,3.4394,4.4694,5.7185,0.5343,1.2422,3.5895,4.7941,4.8763,0.4721,3.2986,4.0065,0.0692,1.9578,0.7914,4.5473,0.8651,3.7171,0.8709,3.7131,3.4417,4.0348,3.0952,9.4215,1.646,9.1367,6.1398,1.1202,2.9989,4.3679,7.11,0.4507,0.9885,0.303,5.3909,3.8867,5.5231,2.4236,10.6253,2.3688,4.0289,9.2198,0.0083,1.7507,3.9662,2.7786,3.5012,0.0048,0.0052,0.0918,0.5756,0.0002,4.65,4.1876,1.5407,1.8128,4.5995,3.3824,0.4253,1.3845,3.2953,1.3384,8.2798,2.4906,3.575,0.052,0.6898,2.4406,9.1968,2.56,3.119,3.5264,2.7133,3.0206,0.0002,4.4406,1.2337,14.7927,7.3074,1.7822,4.6777,0.4809,1.8805,0.424,1.8993,0.0002,3.719,4.2349,1.3284,0.8268,0.0348,1.6065,3.7264,0.2012,2.8918,5.0806,2.7349,1.244,0.0002,3.8119,3.9076,9.533,1.1222,1.0276,0.0566,3.276,2.1207,1.3558,0.454,1.2813,0.2373,2.0583,4.608,0.5201,0.5672,0.0075,4.3507,3.731,4.72,0.0099,2.5256,0.519,6.5349,3.8873,3.7565,1.4628,4.5755,0.8105,0.5223,1.2479,0.2519,0.5827,0.3012,0.788,0.102,6.9974,4.8892,0.7195,1.8138,3.7037,3.2104,1.2509,8.162,2.2014,0.9709,3.387,3.0029,5.8813,2.3706,0.7025,1.5246,0.6163,6.3766,1.825,3.3757,3.2517,1.6845,5.608,4.1809,1.128,3.6207,6.1596,7.0252,2.4798,1.7285,4.0562,0.4873,7.9578,4.674,1.7929,3.627,0.8437,7.1429,4.713,0.2765,2.8931,0.6449,9.4281,7.983,4.2183,2.7816,1.2139,2.9117,3.2224,1.8952,3.4156,4.0787,4.263,2.6613,3.4475,1.7248,5.3371,1.7466,2.0205,4.1387,3.3986,0.5334,2.6382,0.7298,4.4081,2.7119,0.1901,0.4665,0.2061,1.4133,0.9971,2.6227,2.8996,2.3892,0.0116,2.6033,5.1032,2.8986,3.4006,3.4862,4.0274,0.0057,0.3741,2.669,1.6182,0.8375,0.9515,0.0002,4.7276,0.9296,2.883,3.2996,4.3178,1.6161,6.0431,5.5298,0.6311,5.2185,0.0004,2.0619,0.8132,1.948,4.6344,2.6852,1.2069,7.7095,0.1025,2.031,2.1258,6.0239,3.0851,6.5319,2.5073,0.7675,7.9689,3.5644,0.286,7.9811,0.4302,0.3561,5.5494,6.836,2.1961,2.7323,4.6586,0.0116,0.3594,0.631,6.3592,3.9158,4.672,1.8067,2.4169,1.6801,3.569,1.5476,2.0442,1.5587,5.6938,4.5542,8.9474,0.2428,12.4101,8.0962,3.3107,1.6113,0.5195,0.0002,3.3474,3.5949,2.6841,2.401,1.2514,1.9157,4.3404,4.0411,3.4203,1.2486,0.8357,4.4692,5.1278,5.2416,1.9531,6.7993,3.7556,3.8667,2.0762,1.9974,5.098,1.9861,0.7844,2.6055,0.3589,6.8024,2.4409,4.2403,4.7517,7.0568,0.4114,5.6348,3.5594,1.5151,4.351,4.901,4.2492,3.0963,5.5685,6.7426,0.6862,0.8957,1.7303,0.3352,1.4275,2.5834,7.4004,1.2989,1.234,4.5205,2.1971,1.5977,1.7675,0.0058,3.5208,0.6796,0.892,3.6477,0.3418,2.2136,2.3063,5.5603,0.0006,2.4684,0.1208,4.9897,3.2867,0.4555,2.5949,0.7365,5.4175,5.24,3.1807,6.9621,0.0663,0.7228,5.2509,0.3915,0.1335,0.0036,4.3395,3.0916,3.2112,3.2514,3.1241,0.0029,0.9022,1.3095,1.5562,1.0733,0.6534,9.0979,0.1799,0.3561,4.1178,4.1158,0.5542,4.9416,4.3842,0.6398,1.6828,0.449]}

And that was probably the first thing that struck me when I heard of the story of The Cat & the Robot.\n\nThis story begins with Elodie. Elodie is a 6 year old girl living in the countryside with her very scientific father and little brother. But Elodie and her brother are not content with just playing with robot toys. They want to create their own! They want to create a robot that looks like her and plays like her.\n\nConsequently, Elodie has to figure out how to turn her own body into the base parts of a robot. And she has to do this before her father and brother discover the project.\n\nThe actual story takes place over a period of a few months. Elodie turns her sister into a robot that looks like her and behaves like her. However, once she reveals what they\u2019ve done to her family, her siblings\u2019 robot goes wild and takes off running.\n\nHow is this a bad thing? Well, as it turns out, Elodie has an unusual problem. If she\u2019s not actually there to hold her robot, she won\u2019t be able to control it. Thus, Elodie has to stay with the other robot and act as a pseudo-body.\n\nWhich leads me to my only problem with the book. I liked Elodie. I liked her sister Boffin and brother Theo. But I didn\u2019t really care about any of them.\n\nAnd so, when Boffin goes insane from all the running they\u2019ve done, I was like \u2026 well \u2026 ok \u2026. I\u2019ll come back for the sequel. But now, I\u2019m just not feeling it.\n\nAnd that is something I absolutely cannot get past.\n\nI want to. I\u2019m a big robot fan. Even if it\u2019s not a science fiction book. However, Elodie was boring and flat and didn\u2019t ever really do anything. She was just there to create her robot. And then she turned her sister into a robot and they lived happily ever after. Right?\n\nNo. Not much of a story. And a really bad idea for a sequel. So much so that I\u2019ll need to find something else to read next. In the meantime, tell me. Do you like the concept of this book?","token_len":529,"entropy":[9.6698,3.5526,0.4707,7.1643,5.0434,5.9927,6.4415,0.2337,6.9846,3.3973,1.6075,0.0088,4.2182,14.9304,7.7262,3.3706,2.3153,4.2763,5.9323,2.8795,1.103,1.1604,3.0692,2.1435,2.3015,0.1537,5.7435,6.7649,3.9275,5.028,0.9706,1.5987,3.0751,3.5135,3.8938,4.3834,1.224,2.2773,1.8624,1.356,2.5237,0.0368,1.544,0.2034,2.8124,3.5081,1.9033,4.9275,0.954,4.0612,0.3026,5.5851,0.0425,0.0297,0.6216,2.1691,0.0002,3.9422,1.898,4.2434,0.961,8.3837,6.4097,0.2729,4.373,2.2971,0.0132,0.0022,0.8522,0.5768,6.4137,1.6285,0.0689,0.7082,3.5673,0.5907,2.0563,4.7977,2.6977,0.3671,6.292,8.4083,2.0356,2.2863,5.0997,1.3425,0.4346,4.1839,3.0506,0.0131,0.0014,4.173,0.2647,2.5564,1.5119,2.3063,5.4387,0.6386,2.723,4.0622,1.1785,5.7604,1.1604,0.5356,1.0262,1.4954,0.1975,3.2435,2.4365,0.0106,5.6362,2.41,0.9967,0.2211,1.9246,1.5027,2.3316,1.0926,4.5531,0.6794,5.5719,2.4598,5.5723,2.0565,0.7014,0.6498,1.2396,0.0001,5.6783,6.7149,0.082,0.2366,1.3598,0.0028,0.0008,2.6671,1.2392,3.6521,0.0268,0.6096,0.0334,5.4054,1.2945,2.7817,3.9556,0.2433,2.6998,6.9035,6.8379,0.4935,0.7443,1.3678,0.9078,2.4591,2.1987,2.1398,0.2036,2.38,1.6558,5.3519,2.0617,2.7702,2.427,1.7524,5.035,1.5616,8.441,0.9811,0.666,0.0001,2.0681,8.1087,1.1761,2.8021,0.0587,3.8039,1.2149,2.4426,0.0118,3.1441,1.2662,1.2001,0.9537,2.3082,0.0035,0.0013,7.0124,2.3067,4.6436,1.4888,0.4209,1.3605,3.6399,2.8094,0.262,0.9105,1.3042,5.6424,0.2154,0.6281,0.4352,4.1631,0.0664,4.7473,1.1543,7.4098,3.1569,4.7563,17.5992,2.1481,2.073,2.3353,1.2098,0.3957,5.7192,0.5101,2.7136,3.5365,4.8974,0.6013,13.6686,5.1685,3.6253,1.4125,4.098,3.2611,5.5554,0.9235,0.6495,0.0001,5.6341,3.4474,1.2334,3.1021,3.5435,0.4629,0.3733,1.8962,0.1541,3.7024,2.9595,0.2829,0.0005,0.1594,1.0863,0.0026,0.0016,2.2858,3.4422,3.3665,4.8336,1.0062,4.6219,0.5613,5.5634,0.3126,2.2631,2.0146,6.4667,6.0992,2.1805,6.6731,1.3697,1.9261,1.0218,1.3167,4.4094,1.2224,0.5338,0.0697,1.2147,0.2233,0.0019,3.6646,0.2847,0.5542,5.5112,0.3738,1.5716,0.0038,0.0018,1.5469,0.0808,5.5857,2.7313,2.4226,3.4155,3.5036,2.3789,5.9209,0.6891,1.8438,8.6479,0.6274,4.5946,1.9148,0.6859,0.0001,5.6665,3.1172,2.7052,0.1304,1.7875,7.8838,2.1969,1.1317,1.1717,4.8316,0.6618,1.9494,5.6131,4.2052,0.0015,0.0011,2.2293,1.0505,1.6141,1.5728,7.4484,9.4774,8.8397,2.5574,2.2244,8.7624,7.2103,0.5024,2.192,1.0756,1.7387,0.1449,0.3629,0.0051,3.4917,3.3699,1.2223,4.0301,0.041,0.7712,0.3515,1.9022,0.0002,3.0778,2.459,1.032,3.1872,3.5936,0.0111,0.0023,4.1925,5.0256,5.2314,4.3035,1.0033,7.9536,4.1898,0.9749,0.1983,0.1943,0.5076,1.1938,4.3812,2.7909,3.7475,6.7926,2.9967,2.9549,5.2117,2.331,6.2507,2.3251,3.252,0.1062,4.0425,5.8294,0.3758,3.301,2.2171,2.0871,0.3795,2.9275,3.8874,1.5695,1.3363,2.704,0.0755,0.4025,3.0653,3.0966,3.4135,2.6665,0.3876,0.4984,0.0002,2.9909,2.2919,1.3035,5.3756,1.2062,6.5584,2.8442,2.6341,2.9846,0.6687,1.0137,0.0003,2.4149,3.2972,0.349,8.0019,2.1356,2.6242,0.0783,0.4956,3.9066,1.5719,0.5222,0.0236,0.1671,6.8604,1.3019,2.2297,1.454,0.0473,0.2618,1.2673,2.3023,5.6133,0.2069,2.6164,0.7147,6.6534,0.0453,4.9571,0.0063,0.0007,3.7916,10.0041,1.9482,7.0398,3.849,4.0835,0.0667,0.1275,0.009,6.0278,1.8629,3.0573,0.4984,2.1215,2.3932,1.3358,1.2802,4.8027,0.4581,5.3235,2.2896,2.3797,0.9206,1.3695,3.2945,1.4552,4.0994,1.9043,0.8975,0.2717,0.2735,0.4392,1.7528,5.1873,6.2111,1.1584,0.0216,0.0335,0.2664,7.4163,0.3075,0.452,0.0002,4.2148,0.7702,3.0628,7.3396,2.4936,0.6861,1.5219,0.5509,2.772,5.1414,4.3612,1.8839,2.8198,3.7486,0.6876,3.2671,0.2364,4.0718,4.1402,1.0688,0.4756,0.7406,2.8902,0.0534,3.9915,5.1464,0.2856,3.809,2.7747,1.041,0.5102,2.2753,3.0353,0.4901,5.9723,1.8452,0.4644,0.0587,7.6657,0.1822,3.2823,4.4241,0.245,1.8517,1.7013,3.6185,0.1872,4.6259,2.0884,0.1832]}
{"id":788,"ended":true,"length":513,"text":"Give the real, untold story behind how Osama Bin Laden was killed by a woman and found dead by Seal Team Six.\n\nThe book is a collection of first hand stories of a group of highly skilled, special forces veterans who spent hours, days and weeks of their career hunting Bin Laden down, and finally killing him through intelligence sources and human intelligence (HUMINT). These are the real untold story of the mission to kill him.\n\nThis book is a real eye opener. It tells how the mission to kill Osama Bin laden started and was executed. What went through the minds of the SEAL Team members as they had to undertake the mission.\n\nThe authors had the opportunity to interview men and women who have been to Afghanistan to kill Bin Laden. Each one had his or her own reasons why they joined the military to kill a man who was responsible for the deaths of thousands. Even in death Bin Laden is the villain that is in most books and movies where the hero has to kill him.\n\nThe book shows how the SEAL team followed the trail of intelligence from where it began, and how they kept going, even after every lead had blown. At the same time how they have been able to keep the information secret from the public, while at the same time not giving away their methods.\n\nThe book shows how every person who has worked in the government at some point in their life have wanted to kill Bin Laden and they have come up with different ways to get justice for the thousands of Americans who died as a result of his hands.\n\nThey all agreed that Bin Laden deserved the death sentence. They were all waiting for the time that it would be given, and would have loved to be there to witness it.\n\nIt is said that this was one of the most important missions that the United States have carried out in the last decade, killing Bin Laden and bringing him to justice is the ultimate goal of the book. Not to prove who is better, or who is stronger. It is about the satisfaction of knowing that justice is done.\n\nThe mission was executed in the same way which was originally intended, without firing a single bullet during the entire mission. This took the mission to new heights which would even surpass what others have done and been involved in before. Only an elite group of men and women can achieve what they were involved in.\n\nThis book shows how a small group of determined people can work together and achieve results that no one may have believed possible in a previous era. The first time in history that men and women joined forces to achieve justice for the US and rest of the world.","token_len":533,"entropy":[3.0746,7.1087,5.2226,10.1582,0.9869,3.4281,3.7677,8.9745,2.4558,0.0027,2.257,1.8051,2.6941,2.3292,7.1271,3.1197,6.6319,3.1539,2.6131,13.0836,0.2223,1.6586,1.481,1.0957,0.0032,2.6688,4.5164,1.7576,2.1326,3.8622,0.0179,7.0465,2.2139,3.9339,2.3435,3.4831,3.7017,0.2335,4.5254,2.1312,2.237,7.9367,1.0885,3.8308,0.8143,3.7658,7.5556,2.7903,2.7169,0.652,1.6176,4.3634,0.2907,5.3205,4.8812,5.3994,0.0074,3.4797,1.8693,2.6496,3.349,3.0464,0.1392,5.6643,6.2509,6.0024,1.3952,7.1575,3.0208,6.0675,3.7372,3.7702,0.0581,0.8354,4.6392,3.0743,1.1418,3.9718,6.1753,3.2033,0.9476,1.4998,4.7327,2.5335,0.8871,3.9243,0.6554,0.6535,0.0002,2.6548,0.795,0.7737,1.5984,4.8192,6.4851,0.8433,2.1869,1.2514,2.8989,5.1536,1.727,3.9362,1.5806,0.22,1.9512,0.3211,11.3158,0.0445,7.0007,1.9073,4.6958,3.4397,1.539,4.2516,3.8485,4.4273,1.9132,1.0282,0.061,1.4563,1.0227,2.1632,7.9012,5.1853,0.2139,5.7151,1.6669,8.1078,1.3367,0.9721,2.6078,1.9845,0.0002,1.7666,5.2187,5.6285,3.1634,2.081,0.0682,2.842,6.1552,0.8306,0.0137,0.8331,2.9716,1.8355,5.1163,1.3411,3.1976,5.6815,0.9654,0.1747,0.8406,5.2676,2.384,2.0555,3.1226,0.9996,0.003,0.2061,4.4399,2.199,0.5894,5.4268,0.5162,4.7791,3.5493,1.6385,3.5372,1.7002,2.0696,1.51,6.2797,0.0281,1.3517,2.2453,0.0671,2.0411,1.8484,6.4914,3.8082,5.1122,7.1855,0.2004,3.8868,3.4344,5.9558,3.9465,2.4996,4.449,4.5523,4.7298,2.9829,2.2806,5.851,0.9877,1.9287,3.3695,1.0494,2.6929,3.719,0.8852,0.7637,0.0001,1.471,0.972,4.3038,1.2043,1.4134,1.7962,1.641,5.7904,1.1722,4.0175,0.4568,5.7467,3.0518,7.0757,4.0696,4.2207,2.0081,2.0502,2.3773,1.3073,5.2311,3.6944,2.9457,3.2834,1.361,6.0719,5.9971,3.1684,7.9565,1.1497,5.966,0.9719,2.4221,0.0031,6.5715,0.7006,6.3497,2.5196,1.3186,0.0051,1.9613,2.0341,4.5268,4.241,1.7052,0.6555,0.8701,2.3954,4.7343,3.271,0.0272,0.0029,0.0018,3.7482,2.9998,3.3129,3.158,4.4999,1.0151,0.4825,0.0002,1.2204,0.827,2.8153,0.7146,5.4577,3.9056,1.1491,1.2929,3.5085,1.844,0.4971,6.3741,4.6247,2.8653,0.1527,1.5444,0.2131,1.5297,5.6781,6.2234,0.3349,1.181,0.586,0.0109,1.8465,3.1548,1.008,4.4365,1.6042,0.3313,5.0472,1.6048,0.8952,2.7205,8.3314,1.081,1.7399,5.7296,0.622,3.3035,0.5224,2.7279,4.0149,0.2302,0.0193,0.3352,2.4897,7.2477,4.123,0.5066,0.0002,4.5595,3.5018,5.2849,0.8882,3.7945,0.0405,3.6711,1.4975,0.9967,3.5603,1.35,1.7134,3.3919,1.5707,6.3617,0.3685,0.9431,3.9206,3.998,3.7495,0.362,0.932,4.3198,3.0976,1.1786,5.4861,2.6579,5.1952,0.7713,2.6325,2.559,1.3441,2.9396,1.8067,0.3843,0.7399,0.0002,3.4457,0.9632,5.099,0.2111,3.8667,2.606,2.7146,0.0983,0.1162,2.0635,1.8302,3.6722,1.9826,0.9078,3.3125,0.0026,5.5557,4.0698,0.0061,1.1888,0.9164,1.4537,3.8621,2.2226,6.0139,1.9065,0.0076,2.2473,4.0481,1.2637,0.6438,0.1912,8.7309,2.0547,2.6979,1.5821,1.0824,1.1795,3.0445,0.1471,6.5351,4.0111,6.474,5.3562,2.0505,4.7615,1.4606,3.0726,1.7939,0.437,4.5473,1.7912,1.772,0.2767,2.9959,1.5997,8.1151,0.714,2.5915,0.6927,5.6692,1.4066,1.4082,1.0816,0.479,0.0002,1.4473,5.6004,1.8853,2.3632,2.5335,2.0895,4.062,0.298,7.9495,2.4659,6.0774,2.651,2.205,5.3495,7.6657,0.3204,1.2531,1.9258,7.3034,0.4175,2.6949,1.1639,0.2424,2.6477,6.3594,2.3177,5.4968,1.122,6.4621,0.5646,4.7791,4.0538,6.4821,3.6441,2.7073,7.0043,1.5212,1.2043,4.1105,5.7894,6.1265,0.1877,2.9352,0.443,6.6497,5.5998,4.2177,2.0847,0.3987,2.1989,1.4926,0.0543,2.8686,3.1031,3.7571,1.563,3.485,6.2597,0.1414,1.1674,0.4422,0.0001,2.0386,0.9722,2.4209,0.8207,3.8289,4.1562,0.4569,0.2067,7.4657,2.8401,2.7138,5.0115,1.0252,2.0029,3.1755,4.9994,2.1541,3.2823,0.6521,7.7894,0.5223,4.9502,0.541,3.2283,2.2638,5.1241,4.5862,0.256,2.517,5.1596,2.7784,4.6311,1.1267,0.7866,5.5033,0.2578,0.0036,5.0917,0.6571,1.3681,4.3995,4.7819,1.0718,1.5151,6.6318,2.5931,9.0226,1.2542,0.0737,0.0093,2.0006]}

We still don't know what trapped us in there, or why things started to feel like reality instead of a game, but there's one thing I'm 100 % certain about : things would've gone a lot different if I hadn't been logged into my alt-account.\n\nThe character in question was a rogue female, she was a fairly inexperienced player, so she didn't have any good stuff, she was mostly an adventure-oriented character with the hopes of finding some \"treasure\" hidden in the old city of Thay.\n\nIt was a cold evening, and she was using one of the free flight-modes. There was a lot of fog up above, and I remember that feeling of anticipation as I slowly started to drift up to her current position.\n\nYou had to turn 180 degrees in order to reach the city and everything around it, as though the city was stuck in an eternal position, but at the same time it felt like an illusion of real time : the sky remained the same, the time was still counting in the same fashion, the wind felt the same in both our presence and that of our character.\n\nIn any other game, you wouldn't have been able to go any further than the area around the first building of the first town and still be in the same position as you are now :\n\nSo what happened exactly? Well, I was the one that was actually in real life, playing the character in an RPG. Then my character came down from the sky, at the same time that I was :\n\nWhen I looked around, my character was standing on a bridge far above the city of Thay, and as soon as I was visible on the real sky, the sky was getting a transparent (as opposed to the opaque one in the game), and the terrain was changing into the old city.\n\nI was able to walk around and touch things, I could see the character standing on the broken down bridge, as well as the houses that can be found there, the whole thing was happening in less than 10 seconds time. Not to mention that it all still felt like a game, and my character stayed in the same spot, facing the same direction even if she was no longer the same.\n\nThen, as if nothing happened at all, my chariot started to move and the fog got back.\n\nIt was actually really fast and I was unable to react to it.\n\nAt least I got to test out all the new features in WoW that were going to be released soon : )","token_len":533,"entropy":[4.2507,10.5645,1.899,1.5103,9.0209,4.6406,1.9659,6.4796,1.0677,4.4074,5.5977,2.5032,0.0005,0.2454,1.4049,13.0757,1.8723,0.9483,3.9351,1.3416,2.7637,2.1567,5.9491,3.9737,2.1212,5.4671,1.3859,8.1082,5.6798,0.083,2.3949,3.0878,3.2344,0.4642,3.4395,1.1744,4.6503,0.4685,1.4469,2.8045,6.3393,5.9992,0.5654,1.8796,5.9425,8.8663,5.0636,2.281,3.569,3.1261,0.8507,5.2069,1.0404,1.7755,1.6324,0.0004,1.4782,1.9059,0.9289,4.086,8.085,3.5599,3.6745,0.8018,1.8748,0.0248,3.4013,6.7075,4.3228,0.3992,1.7742,2.2233,6.4337,7.3949,3.1773,4.3935,1.2463,2.1219,6.6153,4.67,2.939,1.3009,3.7607,1.4416,2.8636,0.0004,1.2284,1.7503,4.6791,4.8064,3.8435,2.6177,1.1545,4.8878,4.1928,5.333,2.4479,2.5108,0.5342,3.0504,3.69,7.0869,0.3318,3.5509,1.8121,5.5045,6.6856,0.1491,0.5228,4.8972,1.1933,0.8233,6.885,4.1446,2.5395,5.7783,2.9912,1.8029,1.6912,0.0002,3.7347,1.4299,1.9932,6.485,4.7425,1.4025,1.0296,3.3155,0.7781,6.8125,4.3677,0.1026,1.0063,6.8878,7.121,4.2744,5.6214,2.4115,2.2826,4.2442,0.6749,0.8429,3.0772,0.1061,4.5615,5.5369,4.6261,2.2444,0.834,2.5562,5.2883,3.4707,5.018,2.6264,6.4736,2.7467,0.5372,5.6163,3.8025,0.4117,4.5615,4.8043,2.3536,1.4431,8.32,0.9835,0.5737,1.1658,0.0003,5.6591,4.3455,1.5841,5.0849,7.9096,0.697,2.7736,0.5607,0.0623,4.018,1.1028,3.7629,3.2686,7.1776,3.0349,1.3319,1.5057,4.751,5.9874,3.1761,2.7063,0.8049,6.4417,0.8008,3.0082,2.6559,7.5932,1.9986,2.8798,4.2283,1.2443,0.1862,0.0091,2.2546,1.7249,0.8279,3.6587,4.3899,2.9996,5.1664,2.4358,7.0018,2.2383,4.2287,8.2375,3.4611,0.0227,0.7643,1.9882,6.1836,1.8439,2.635,9.0089,5.2172,1.3863,3.0288,3.5925,1.2002,2.1491,4.6914,4.8504,2.7549,0.0486,3.7305,4.7037,7.2567,7.2718,0.3077,2.8947,0.1909,2.7416,4.644,0.4389,0.4282,0.0003,4.2439,4.1138,3.9533,1.5736,0.6811,1.3781,3.5266,0.0009,1.3266,1.8843,0.1424,0.0011,4.5338,3.6876,0.5747,1.101,2.1266,6.6767,1.7498,1.0573,6.2545,4.0273,3.1689,0.7329,4.2057,4.322,3.4892,3.3804,1.452,2.4452,1.2002,1.347,1.3487,1.6067,3.0926,2.1863,0.8705,2.7971,5.5437,0.0004,3.8155,3.0141,1.8722,7.4592,0.8949,3.5913,0.2497,2.1208,2.3495,4.3506,1.804,2.33,1.8314,4.4484,2.1464,6.9251,1.2558,1.0503,5.9078,1.6597,4.5621,1.7986,6.3028,3.4986,1.3496,5.7176,4.0251,2.0439,3.5071,4.6004,1.4763,0.5969,1.3089,1.169,6.383,1.0328,1.0861,0.2316,1.8833,0.9017,0.3383,11.1644,1.049,0.0003,4.8667,0.4481,2.7468,2.3071,0.9654,3.2643,0.7025,0.8488,2.9921,1.7942,1.3687,4.3832,7.2838,2.2461,0.504,0.9207,3.0384,0.0848,0.003,0.9411,1.8966,4.1054,3.1411,0.0039,0.4104,3.33,6.6261,4.3968,0.5354,6.6948,5.3343,0.4885,2.2795,3.775,1.3545,5.9477,3.1729,9.7906,6.1509,4.5437,1.7835,0.0021,1.3878,3.7956,3.4584,2.719,0.7358,0.8962,3.9069,1.0796,1.9838,6.4034,0.9096,4.5097,4.6814,2.5515,5.7856,1.3607,1.6743,0.5797,0.0003,1.811,1.5966,2.9323,0.0065,3.5743,1.6325,2.6054,7.0899,2.1815,1.2344,3.2556,1.2748,2.3381,1.3854,6.096,3.9921,0.8345,0.7108,7.2661,5.2241,1.1967,0.6812,3.7416,1.4832,0.0145,1.0069,6.0828,2.318,9.0966,0.4877,1.0432,2.6294,1.3453,3.2863,5.7408,2.6567,0.9674,4.7435,1.3522,5.7087,0.056,2.7069,0.3727,7.392,0.6366,6.3187,3.5975,0.1445,1.2348,2.2959,5.2616,6.2472,0.7328,0.7752,1.2165,1.8499,1.757,1.7131,4.6091,1.0313,6.1353,1.4402,0.9713,1.2225,2.6247,2.2242,6.6143,1.2433,2.1908,0.6049,5.5774,2.6567,2.4135,0.8815,5.0796,0.029,4.6824,0.8783,2.8508,0.2729,0.0002,4.3672,1.9071,2.9538,3.0028,5.0179,2.9096,2.9052,0.086,0.2558,2.4838,7.6893,4.3816,2.5603,0.6306,2.2,3.3712,2.854,4.9531,3.6999,5.6161,4.4934,1.028,0.0003,2.9427,0.806,4.7753,3.949,3.4341,2.4956,2.3056,1.5183,5.3949,0.0018,3.4409,1.6232,1.0773,1.8764,1.4787,0.0003,4.0419,4.1868,1.766,3.8033,1.2749,7.8252,2.0941,3.9808,0.5991,2.1608,2.6066,2.3986,5.3332,0.1919,4.1669,1.7741,3.7329,1.1107,0.8852,2.6448,2.2171,1.6231,6.82]}

It's the day of your grand opening and all of your dreams have come true except one...\n\nBookstores are one of the things I love the most about this big world we live in. It's one place where everything is at peace. Where I can walk in, escape from the ordinary and just relax. The staff can help you with anything you're looking for. It's also a place where people can go to relax, and that is very satisfying to me.\n\nAs a child, I spent every possible moment I could there. I was always reading a book and would go there at lunch and after school to have some down time. I would always go and borrow a book, which I would usually never return; I just liked the sound the title made when I heard it in the store. When I was older I started working in the bookstore where my love for this hobby grew even more.\n\nThe biggest attraction for me is the magic that flows through bookstores. To feel the warm of the sun on my face as I pick up a book and feel that book-smell (which I realize no one else can smell). The book store has always been the haven of escape and creativity.\n\nI work in a children's book store and it can get pretty boring so I spend my time reading. But my favorite part is when I see the kids look at a book and they're like \"What is that book?\" and they see the picture and it sparks a whole new connection between them and the book. I get to do that all day. It's amazing.\n\nI got into it through my family. My father runs a little bookstore where he is known as the Book Worm. I worked for him while in high school and it was there that I realized I was actually enjoying myself. One of my favorite parts of work is getting to watch the connection between a reader and a book--the pleasure they convey to the other person when they both finish reading and are sharing it in a way that can only be described as \"book-love\". The book store really is one of the happiest places on earth!","token_len":534,"entropy":[5.2847,8.8058,0.7583,1.0719,0.8338,2.4618,1.831,9.4057,1.8202,6.8059,3.2205,6.444,5.1038,0.5268,0.7866,5.9259,4.2147,2.5708,0.9587,3.8858,2.4443,6.0385,1.9152,0.5378,1.2917,2.9616,1.4332,5.1754,1.8459,6.8335,5.3967,5.1204,0.3831,3.5086,2.1919,7.3682,4.0406,2.754,1.6278,7.2489,3.0667,4.9209,6.2717,5.0499,3.0094,4.1245,1.5494,9.8175,1.9289,1.7559,3.3476,0.466,5.4699,1.2768,2.6029,4.0821,1.0995,2.8278,2.1105,6.9511,8.7211,2.0923,0.1113,3.0852,2.9425,4.7526,2.2158,0.2051,4.3005,0.7509,1.5672,4.1064,4.4167,6.083,2.4973,0.4277,0.3635,1.8528,5.5897,4.7929,1.1327,2.303,2.5804,5.0804,1.8046,1.9291,4.2659,1.6917,2.527,3.0253,6.8423,3.7667,2.454,2.3568,1.0414,1.3813,2.5345,6.1265,5.7947,1.3438,3.4216,0.6196,3.3531,4.9814,1.8018,1.3034,6.7596,2.4304,2.8638,4.011,1.9429,1.5748,3.4782,1.6527,1.2002,0.0324,9.2385,3.1086,2.6659,0.5254,0.0003,5.9636,1.6132,0.9477,4.8244,0.2996,0.3847,3.758,1.853,1.6998,2.5423,0.0321,0.5295,3.0567,7.8515,3.886,3.338,0.4348,0.0208,0.512,2.2719,0.6134,4.2323,3.4509,0.4454,4.0093,0.8452,4.7996,2.645,1.5884,4.4928,4.033,1.1016,4.458,2.2092,2.2531,10.4233,1.6145,1.099,8.2634,2.0341,4.0932,3.6579,1.3592,3.3554,6.1049,4.3886,3.0088,0.842,2.272,1.8072,1.2685,3.5908,2.6109,0.1454,1.2549,2.6588,0.2963,3.7717,1.4616,0.3993,0.3093,3.2822,1.1521,4.0545,1.1155,4.0169,1.5884,2.2037,4.2049,2.3358,4.4443,5.1559,2.2761,0.6949,0.2964,1.0191,0.0003,4.528,1.5722,4.3645,0.8443,0.6038,4.6006,3.7565,5.5415,1.1182,3.59,0.5007,7.5857,2.1756,1.1812,2.3776,1.8039,4.3886,4.6586,0.2614,2.1233,4.9262,2.5509,3.6605,3.9233,3.3302,2.8606,5.656,2.6409,2.4661,4.8043,2.8157,9.8529,0.0615,0.763,1.3352,2.229,2.5402,2.6403,3.2625,6.7803,1.8631,0.3184,2.0852,4.3186,1.4082,1.3253,5.1048,3.9379,4.6976,6.4418,1.4031,3.5492,5.0928,1.8879,5.9,7.227,8.3555,2.581,2.4108,0.7445,3.3458,0.3796,4.0729,0.7264,3.3525,0.2931,3.962,0.3076,1.167,3.2672,1.9544,4.849,4.6395,1.7698,1.007,0.6635,5.0069,3.0953,5.3857,0.9433,6.0559,5.5767,2.1598,4.0336,1.0392,0.708,1.0565,0.0002,2.8941,5.0369,5.4186,1.8219,0.1554,1.8772,1.113,7.0229,2.62,8.7345,1.0176,3.6937,0.431,0.5342,5.5436,6.0649,1.685,6.8576,5.7105,0.8036,3.9755,2.4914,2.656,1.533,3.6739,0.3491,5.8445,0.3431,0.9848,0.1759,2.2282,4.4192,3.4575,4.95,6.0761,5.0635,2.4293,6.594,2.7889,1.6386,6.8621,6.7215,0.3977,1.0154,2.6746,2.2962,3.0858,2.1267,3.1135,2.9383,2.4727,3.0921,0.4267,2.5708,8.3982,1.1008,6.8898,1.7284,4.9499,1.1135,1.8781,0.0003,1.787,5.5703,1.6799,1.2588,8.9749,0.0204,0.5451,0.2509,2.2069,2.7721,5.3087,4.082,2.318,3.8778,5.7099,0.5119,4.3975,2.3062,1.0112,2.2796,2.1076,3.1255,4.1561,1.8095,1.7343,1.0145,1.1403,0.6555,2.7631,1.5137,4.5918,6.7059,0.4028,3.1097,0.2501,1.0362,2.4065,3.281,1.4259,1.4781,3.391,1.8234,0.9667,2.3007,1.2797,1.6762,1.352,5.0559,1.869,4.9709,2.1706,2.7798,7.0849,1.9343,2.9544,0.4342,4.8081,2.0156,2.1951,0.9036,1.2131,0.5156,0.6726,1.9866,4.0345,0.989,3.9917,1.1755,3.7309,1.549,2.0871,2.4818,0.4866,3.1364,0.8756,0.4737,0.0002,1.5821,5.559,2.6772,4.1132,3.9001,1.6977,3.4729,1.3473,1.4613,2.4736,6.7091,0.5138,5.1948,1.3415,3.6842,1.4199,3.5196,4.8444,0.5987,1.5919,4.869,12.8574,0.4618,2.1392,4.6538,2.7927,0.8111,5.0004,4.2351,1.5832,0.0123,0.9165,3.2638,0.5747,3.5298,0.6895,0.3511,3.8988,1.4905,1.2793,3.9147,6.4452,2.3926,0.7739,5.5404,1.5661,1.2414,1.0194,3.3181,0.605,5.5797,0.6195,3.7168,0.6308,5.869,1.49,9.196,0.8346,2.5098,5.8389,0.1467,1.348,0.1402,5.9672,2.4469,6.9763,3.7415,6.278,1.6771,1.9424,5.0595,0.7166,3.6202,0.6821,8.0005,5.5285,0.6117,2.9862,3.918,5.4446,2.6769,3.7692,0.9849,1.7473,0.3583,4.7768,2.5689,0.3389,0.6536,0.1029,2.3843,6.1924,2.251,5.9683,2.3152,3.9619,2.1004,3.3311,5.0459,2.1595,3.0305,0.1804,0.9409,4.8877,0.164,3.2345,0.4087,3.5436]}
{"id":2148,"ended":true,"length":486,"text":"The guillotine will fall. The townsfolk must know the truth about her. Your time is limited. < 175 words\n\nThe town guardsmen have decided it is time to take a look around. They decide to head off to the graveyard to see if they can dig anything up. The grave of a young lady is marked by an ornate stone archway. It has been a few years since we came here for the royal family to leave their last heir.\n\n*\n\nThe stone archway is open. Once inside and the guardsmen are gone, one can hear the soft voice of a woman reading poetry. One of the graves is dug up. It is that of a young and beautiful woman. She is on her knees holding a candle lit. She is in front of a grave with a tombstone. The tombstone reads \"Here lies the corpse of a beautiful maiden who died in her youth.\n\n*\n\nThe woman takes the candlelight that was in her hand, and lights it. She lights the wick that was in the candle and places it on the grave. A small flame dances along the crack between the two stones. Slowly it grows until it reaches the flame.\n\n*\n\nThe witch puts the wick in her mouth as she reads more of her poems. She reads about a beautiful girl who dies far from the court. She leaves her one wish : To have eyes as dark and cold as the moon when she was born. When she was alive, her beauty would melt stone.\n\n*\n\nThe girl takes the flames and sets a path to the next grave. The flame dances in between the stones and the tombstones. There, the girl places the flame. It catches in the stone and slowly consumes the top of the tombstone to consume the body under it.\n\n*\n\nThe witch takes the wick out of her mouth and places it on the final grave. There is a poem on it which reads : \"This stone was carved by the hand of my wife who is dead, and I hope that my daughter in the next generation will carry out the torch of my art.\"\n\n*\n\nThe wick is lit. The flame dances and the body in front of it is consumed as well. The flames consume the tombstone as well.

{"id":2289,"ended":true,"length":493,"text":"You submit a DNA sample to AncestoryDNA to find your genealogy, the results are... unexpected\nOn my second DNA test, I got an email with a link to take an AncestryDNA test.\nI have always done a DNA test, probably on every family, so I was well used to the usual DNA result being a list of ancestors and the percentage of the DNA inherited from each.\nSo for example, if you did a test from Ancestry DNA, you would get a result like this:\n\nYou receive an email with instructions for taking a test from MyHeritage DNA. You\u2019re intrigued but want to know more so you decide to watch a video to learn more about them.\nA video opens showing a woman talking about how there was no good answer to questions about her health. She was told she had cancer when she was a young child and was told the worst case scenario that she will most likely die before her 40th birthday. She was told to enjoy life because no one knows how they will die.\nThe woman goes on to say that she didn\u2019t like this scenario but that is where her story ends. The video continues without explaining what happened next.\nHow did this result come about?\nI took the same test as the woman in the video, as well as the MyHeritageDNA test. I also shared all those results on this post.\nSo after my second test, I decided to check my genetic results of the other two tests. Since those results were completely different to the result for the video, I decided to try the same test from MyHeritage.\nHere is what the MyHeritage DNA result looks like.\n\nI was expecting to find some of my relatives in the results so I was surprised by the result.\nYou will notice that there are no lines about my health like the other website said. I was surprised because my dad said his wife had cancer so it\u2019s possible that I have inherited genes from that. He\u2019s 73 year old now so he said that in the next 20 years, he will most likely die because he has prostate cancer.\nI thought that maybe the DNA tests from the other two companies would show more about my health, but they didn\u2019t.\nAt least I got a test from a company that\u2019s a little more reliable than the MyHeritage DNA test. Since MyHeritage is a much bigger company than the other two, maybe their test is better. So if you are curious about your health, I recommend taking a DNA test from MyHeritage DNA instead of the other two.","token_len":537,"entropy":[9.1558,1.6031,9.5001,0.8923,1.7506,7.2375,13.5967,1.5269,3.1063,4.0335,2.7018,5.6186,0.083,2.4411,3.951,3.3217,1.9977,10.741,9.6004,5.4171,12.2475,4.3833,3.9612,5.1139,0.6805,0.5366,0.4804,3.317,2.2376,2.784,3.1846,1.1286,1.4211,0.2367,8.0362,4.0722,3.0895,0.4364,0.1615,1.3993,0.8281,3.2644,1.5659,4.0793,4.0906,4.4402,2.399,1.3941,0.2461,1.968,7.2145,3.622,5.8702,3.7186,2.2832,3.1812,0.8183,2.4141,6.9425,7.31,0.1203,2.1372,8.1985,4.3341,8.689,5.6087,2.8142,8.1605,0.1352,5.499,2.6683,2.3854,6.0919,0.4228,1.8228,3.1309,9.7511,1.2604,1.1681,2.6899,1.257,3.1461,4.5491,2.1686,0.4533,1.4265,1.7132,5.7526,0.8755,2.2763,5.0165,2.8289,0.1706,3.7187,1.3406,0.8155,0.6861,0.9715,1.4291,4.8848,2.1031,1.1968,0.4131,0.3625,5.1406,4.117,5.2046,1.791,0.3021,1.3741,3.9239,2.1009,2.6363,1.4508,2.0657,1.8666,8.092,7.3316,0.0897,4.6558,1.5535,2.5125,18.9962,8.6018,2.1695,9.3915,5.3329,3.7017,0.3394,1.0875,1.233,5.8649,1.8102,5.272,0.2211,7.6967,2.7644,1.3114,3.1822,2.2354,0.4496,0.6497,6.0125,0.4718,0.6399,4.3345,3.3365,8.927,3.6341,2.1846,4.74,4.4437,0.6956,2.1808,6.1997,2.0761,1.8198,6.1943,5.1349,1.2056,4.9269,1.1036,0.7521,5.7091,1.2723,2.0565,3.2766,3.5681,1.8948,1.319,3.2507,5.0706,0.4258,0.8063,3.6889,2.4814,1.1124,1.2541,2.7659,1.8756,3.4815,5.8203,5.0476,0.555,4.0451,1.0395,5.3401,8.0568,0.0406,1.6179,3.5978,1.2414,3.0107,0.4456,0.0123,1.1006,2.0337,1.6613,0.5035,3.6331,9.532,1.2584,4.4439,5.26,0.5001,3.0754,1.5147,4.5281,0.8003,2.3249,0.9353,0.851,2.473,1.3669,4.5322,0.2964,0.2808,1.5313,0.8607,0.8942,4.187,5.7546,0.7902,0.0937,3.8703,3.2304,5.3923,2.9396,2.4552,4.3508,3.999,2.3015,4.0754,2.6832,0.4114,2.8747,2.4595,3.8723,6.0636,3.5996,1.653,1.3412,3.1286,0.6451,0.5409,5.422,2.2428,1.9252,6.4609,1.556,0.3002,0.1699,0.5521,2.2917,4.3203,2.1008,4.0109,1.3192,2.6219,1.3699,0.9081,2.8545,0.5669,0.2472,1.7102,5.314,1.8011,0.0628,1.6366,9.6287,0.0252,0.0001,5.5155,0.567,0.9709,1.5255,3.7412,5.9937,4.452,5.8175,0.9095,1.8782,4.3511,3.3454,1.1149,0.799,3.2099,4.7981,3.6179,1.9558,0.5426,0.4411,0.3881,3.3337,0.2591,3.187,2.1088,4.1632,3.4865,5.6333,1.6874,3.1277,1.5865,3.1145,0.7986,6.0331,4.9444,1.1188,1.1441,4.8202,0.7984,4.858,1.4774,5.4352,3.3213,1.0376,7.0645,0.3882,0.2941,1.2066,0.0994,3.2142,2.7302,2.474,0.6991,3.0324,2.7169,0.0148,0.0,2.4366,0.7674,3.5274,0.5836,1.2909,2.0584,6.2482,0.0043,0.0001,1.5591,3.4269,0.9611,0.0023,2.7858,0.4774,5.0826,2.0546,2.9674,3.8929,1.9957,2.5632,3.3447,4.103,2.6639,3.9406,2.553,1.0142,3.603,4.4059,0.3273,3.3401,2.2025,2.5238,1.015,3.2641,0.51,1.4106,8.8285,3.4757,0.8596,0.6513,2.2263,1.0904,2.3163,4.6099,5.5248,3.5278,5.2089,5.4281,1.7929,2.2691,10.6571,6.2455,0.4743,1.9877,2.18,2.5342,1.8734,2.703,4.4255,4.2381,3.2467,3.6883,1.5774,0.9672,3.6363,2.6729,5.392,0.1085,0.6498,3.6259,0.9021,3.3152,2.1692,5.1202,6.5379,0.4194,3.6901,2.1759,3.614,3.6869,0.0905,0.7975,9.6108,5.4076,0.0188,5.6086,1.2205,1.4995,3.5334,1.6236,5.3217,2.0611,3.7852,4.0061,0.1378,2.2535,0.9962,1.2854,6.0813,0.0373,0.9454,3.8156,1.2588,2.027,6.5713,0.0533,0.516,0.5987,2.3156,3.604,1.3795,2.6789,2.6533,4.6526,2.7617,3.6684,3.0203,1.3195,0.8879,6.1173,1.6757,2.1785,3.2151,3.2535,0.6149,1.0753,2.0416,0.5048,2.1743,1.524,0.698,0.0917,0.0192,0.4027,0.8186,5.5344,3.261,2.4357,2.8393,1.5231,3.379,2.302,3.2963,1.2957,0.6655,8.1066,0.1007,0.0531,2.5875,3.889,1.4262,3.5746,1.4669,1.9416,1.46,0.0029,0.0001,1.4954,0.7928,0.4102,5.9908,3.1025,0.0059,0.0001,2.1244,1.136,5.3576,2.9241,0.1814,1.7687,2.85,1.933,0.5394,0.9076,5.646,3.6887,2.6008,2.2874,2.7805,0.7699,4.3457,3.1785,1.2743,2.177,2.8292,0.9409,2.7508,2.0758,0.7475,2.5501,1.803,4.2768,0.7093,1.8009,0.1184,0.7247,2.1022,0.0028,0.0001,4.1612,4.2428,0.6293,1.1826,2.2958,0.6362,1.2233]}

A self-proclaimed \"lucky son of a gun\" with an entrepreneurial spirit and a fierce work ethic, he worked night and day, selling everything from cars and electronics to lawn care equipment, painting houses, selling life insurance, working fast food, and even as an exotic dancer. Chris wanted to go to college and achieve a higher education and eventually wanted to run his own business but in order to achieve this he needed to get a better paying job and that's where Will Smith's character, Jeff Skilling, comes in.\n\nA brilliant thriller, an unflinching look at the human heart, and a tale you 'll never forget.

{"id":180,"ended":true,"length":488,"text":"Sci-Fi Realism is a new genre that focuses on the mundane, slice-of-life, everyday aspects that will exist in the coming years, far removed from the high-emotion drama of cyberpunk or space operas. With that in mind, write a story set in the future, but reads like a contemporary work!\n\nThe contest is intended to promote Sci-Fi Realism, so don't try to write a high-concept sci-fi story, as they probably won't be up to the same standard as \"A New Tomorrow\" (which was an excellent example of what the concept can do correctly ). If you submit a realistic, mundane story, you WILL win the contest.\n\nRules:\n1. No explicit and\/or graphic violence of any kind, nor any kind of gore.\n2. No aliens. (In this contest, the term 'alien' will be defined as a creature originating from outer space, not as a person belonging to another race - think of it as a \"Joker\" alien.)\n3. No cybernetic implants or cybernetic parts that don't involve the actual human body.\n4. At most one use of \"smart bombs\", so don't use mind control or teleportation to \"kill\" the bad guys.\n5. In order for your plot to be \"realistic\", your story can't be set in a dystopian post-apocalyptic future (unless you plan to make the setting far more interesting and realistic in which case you're free to do so).\n6. No alternate history, although this can include a fantasy\/science fiction element.\n7. No time travel (sorry, I just can't stomach time travel stories right now, and this contest is to promote the genre )\n8. No magic, although a supernatural element can be used.\n\nSubmissions are to be posted as a reply to this post by Thursday evening EST (that's Saturday evening GMT for you folks in the U.K. ) to be considered. All submitted entries will be in the same format - either as a plain text, or as an MS Word formatted file with the proper page headers (I am aware of some forums that won't accept plaintext submissions).

{"id":211,"ended":true,"length":505,"text":"Beginning at the end...\n\nSunday, January 29, 2012\n\nThe Best I've Read: 2011\n\nI spent hours, and hours, and hours reading this year-long, once-a-week \"challenge year\" (so called because of the format of the challenge itself). So many different things: a daily, word-of-the-day challenge; a weekly, photo-a-day challenge and challenge; and once a month, I took a random book challenge. I also participated in the book club here on The Book Smugglers, where we chose and reviewed a book each month. There was not only a lot of reading to be done, but a good deal of blogging to be done as well.\n\nThe \"end\" of the year is in many ways the beginning of the \"work in progress\" year. I intend to focus my time more closely on specific projects I've been holding back from doing, with the goal of working on them full-time. I have, as usual, a stack of books and e-books I'm currently working on.\n\nI finished this book in the car yesterday while waiting in line at the grocery store. I had forgotten how much I enjoy reading about history. I've actually enjoyed reading books that touch on topics that have been covered before (i.e., it's almost like being able to do a book report on a topic). But I enjoyed the way that the author approached the material, and the way that the book helped explain the ways in which the history was interpreted. It was worth the time to read.\n\nI read this book on my way to a meeting, while driving through Iowa to visit my sister. I have mixed feelings as to how much I enjoyed reading. On the whole, the book was extremely well written and well researched, and it was enjoyable to read. However, the things that did not interest me in any way were the things that dragged on for far too long in the book. In general, it seemed like a lot of the story was told to show what happened and what happened next. I would recommend it if you're looking for a good book about the history of the Mormon pioneers, but I won't be rushing to pick up the next one, because I got a little tired of the repetition.\n\nI'm going to finish reading that, and then I'll finish that one, then I'll read that one. At that rate, it'll probably take me months to get through all the books I promised to read in January.\n\nWhat kind of books will I read this year? I guess we'll just have to wait and see...","token_len":544,"entropy":[4.7237,1.737,1.3695,9.8064,1.3789,0.0902,8.6918,0.7651,2.7886,3.3579,0.6888,2.7126,0.959,0.0004,3.1273,6.5488,6.3075,0.8317,5.9441,3.8595,8.5922,1.5672,0.0003,2.5806,5.4514,4.9169,4.7628,2.6021,1.4855,0.5561,2.5417,0.0417,2.7777,1.6979,3.9017,7.6558,1.3586,3.4283,7.3048,0.1998,1.8474,0.0035,0.5928,4.544,9.1425,0.0522,5.8819,0.5311,3.6398,5.4387,3.2553,0.4261,2.2462,0.8414,5.3128,1.7554,0.5412,2.633,3.6992,0.7777,4.3195,3.3481,3.7419,2.0159,5.3953,3.6326,6.7623,3.3607,9.2403,0.088,2.198,0.0021,3.3509,0.0026,1.0116,3.6855,3.2808,0.9924,1.5328,0.4638,7.3358,0.3002,5.6953,0.0558,0.3024,0.4168,5.4213,5.2334,1.6276,2.3366,7.4905,1.2041,1.7305,0.2416,3.9228,5.0423,1.3235,5.9888,6.1693,6.4752,1.3034,1.9118,3.5172,4.8042,0.0444,2.1603,5.0454,2.6322,7.4962,3.0822,3.3047,4.66,6.9643,2.5023,0.0158,2.0802,1.9627,3.1674,7.7147,4.3104,3.399,2.3659,2.6207,2.2946,1.7461,0.8761,4.1983,1.8201,5.5311,3.6925,0.8856,3.0481,0.2531,2.5763,2.1354,2.6405,0.5528,0.5771,0.2552,2.2514,4.4339,1.9599,0.1265,7.5091,1.3531,0.7831,0.1019,3.2791,0.0104,0.2816,1.0821,0.0003,2.4849,4.5267,7.7913,2.758,0.623,0.6181,0.7704,2.3351,4.1909,5.1605,0.0689,2.076,2.2072,0.1216,0.6097,2.9639,6.9876,4.5461,0.0019,0.2431,1.9377,0.5586,2.3004,7.2457,0.184,3.5586,3.1319,2.1517,4.9232,5.2459,0.1147,7.3343,2.0686,3.6102,1.3985,0.9391,7.9207,2.4541,1.8997,2.749,1.8882,5.7981,1.6076,0.8665,0.0938,4.3967,0.7858,2.194,6.377,0.5842,0.0082,1.3259,1.5354,3.2087,4.7967,3.7468,2.3824,0.0282,2.6115,8.2212,0.1266,1.6866,2.591,5.9886,1.6043,0.081,2.5622,1.1865,3.4929,0.5344,0.0232,1.5711,1.777,0.0002,1.8664,5.9315,2.652,3.397,2.1676,2.6192,9.3675,4.8294,4.5795,3.591,3.1114,0.384,1.4134,0.9879,3.0806,0.0516,0.9241,1.1886,2.9682,6.0302,2.8679,1.7904,1.1238,5.232,1.6749,3.3875,5.1685,1.8026,1.2581,3.0926,5.3401,3.5301,0.7855,4.6779,2.6491,6.5768,0.2459,2.7481,1.3575,2.4251,1.5458,3.4173,2.8915,3.146,5.2878,0.0021,0.0007,0.5568,6.1783,0.8303,5.1019,2.6799,3.7691,2.4914,0.0035,4.7805,1.7964,2.375,8.7514,1.6891,1.4008,3.0173,3.0483,3.4118,1.3318,5.7434,2.3079,3.5409,1.9521,1.8528,4.6353,5.6848,0.915,5.3602,1.637,1.2272,1.4846,0.9103,0.9162,1.4606,2.1566,4.5014,4.8502,1.6452,6.5489,0.8905,0.0023,1.9639,3.9224,2.7746,5.3183,0.777,2.7308,1.2403,5.5444,1.1507,1.8763,1.8293,0.9082,3.1186,0.4112,0.0002,1.5421,3.9165,2.7055,0.3356,2.8646,1.791,1.6638,0.4708,2.4775,2.7705,3.0554,4.4449,3.3714,3.0439,7.0929,3.3852,2.2386,0.7996,3.469,1.1699,1.1719,4.3577,8.0507,0.0847,5.1988,0.1507,1.474,2.7858,1.1104,1.1888,1.6931,3.1335,4.5997,0.7426,3.8354,0.1442,2.5869,0.8796,1.3174,4.7859,2.2283,0.5963,1.1564,2.1457,3.5045,1.1952,0.8001,1.9847,1.7697,3.2953,0.5034,0.3785,0.824,3.1874,0.0176,2.6474,5.8102,0.8631,5.7543,0.9203,3.2371,0.0099,2.798,5.1712,1.501,1.4887,1.0452,2.0553,0.2746,9.9689,1.8732,1.9039,5.8051,0.1026,0.0405,3.0863,1.6756,1.5784,0.468,3.8552,3.9797,0.0599,2.9997,3.6488,1.186,1.9395,2.455,0.1384,2.0994,4.5815,1.2089,2.8443,4.2094,6.4027,3.5882,2.3954,4.0172,1.4455,2.5795,4.0685,0.8484,1.8876,3.3322,3.9737,3.2043,2.7317,0.0977,1.3444,1.7331,0.2909,0.7271,2.3172,2.2714,2.887,1.8709,2.491,0.1193,1.2955,6.2772,6.8527,2.092,1.9173,1.6479,5.4787,0.0004,1.9141,5.9142,0.8219,2.7065,0.769,1.7029,2.9214,2.169,3.3638,1.7174,0.9406,6.4688,2.4831,2.2332,2.107,0.4604,1.8507,5.2181,0.8844,0.4636,0.0002,1.4744,2.7938,2.4995,0.0541,3.4376,4.1425,5.5168,5.7811,1.2807,2.1848,1.0286,0.8456,2.6137,4.4134,4.3143,2.1554,4.916,0.8465,0.2226,3.7944,1.1776,1.6855,1.7312,5.5449,2.0922,6.8833,0.1024,2.8091,1.7094,3.4967,1.919,0.8291,6.3052,0.6458,2.8981,1.5253,1.9577,1.2921,1.6873,1.8127,9.2288,2.0036,1.4459,2.4815,5.3306,0.5481,1.3882,0.0002,4.1608,5.4906,0.0016,2.1675,2.1979,0.6762,0.7664,1.014,0.0474,0.0828,1.9347,4.8841,3.8658,0.2771,3.0115,0.5268,0.0335,0.3979,0.1562,0.0134,3.4458]}
{"id":2725,"ended":true,"length":502,"text":"You have been selected to take a oneway journey as far as your spaceship will take you. Your mission is to transmit whatever you observe until you lose all contact.\n\nThe second player is the alien. He watches you, and can play \"Hide-and-seek\" with you while you try to transmit an image. Every time you transmit an image, you \"miss\" a hidden image on the screen. If the alien finds you, you lose the game. If he misses, you win, and the two are merged.\n\nRules:\n1. Once the game starts, you play while you can, because you only have two hands.\n2. You win by transmitting all images from the screen. The last player won because his image disappeared before the alien detected him.\n3. The first transmission is always on the upper left : you must choose an image by a \"spoiler\", click on it to transmit it to the screen. If you do not understand how to do that, do not worry : you have all the time in the world to transmit an image.\n4. The alien hides all the images, or hides some only temporarily. So don't forget to check the screen every moment if the image is still there.\n5. You can transmit the same image, but do not transmit all the same images. The main thing is to send as many images as you can, although this increases your risk of being detected : the alien can try to guess what your image is.\n\nThe game is also available on android: play.google.com\n\nYou can also download both free-hand and \"touch\" (as shown in the screenshot) versions in the market.\n\nThe goal of the game is simple.\n\n1. Select a board size and number of columns, two if you can (1, 2 )\n\n2. Go to setup and put all values.\n\n3. Connect with your facebook or google account.\n\n4. Play it now, it is fun.\n\nIf you have problems, contact me please. I need to fix something.\n\n1. The game is based on the game of hide and seek popular during summer holidays to play with children.\n\n2. Do you like it? It's free and you can leave a review.

{"id":448,"ended":false,"length":494,"text":"I don't know who else to ask... I want to install new siding on my house a few inches around the outside, including around windows and patio, and put a small shed off of the deck out of the way. The porch is built on a concrete slab, and I did the work myself so it's not a hard job. But the siding guy wants me to cut the hole and make a whole new opening and put up a gable.\n\nI have plenty of studs, and my siding guy only has to use about two inches on each side to support it. My problem is that everything I have read about adding to a porch will say stuff like \"1\/16\" thick siding will support 3x10 shingles. I've watched numerous videos on Youtube, and I don't see the 2x6 that is in most areas of wood siding there.\n\nAlso, I bought a lot of $20 2x4s with a straight grain because I knew it had to support what was already there and I'd have to rip up the whole thing if I didn't use them.\n\nI just want to make sure that I don't have to rip up the porch to make the hole, and I don't want to use the $40 or $50 I spent on 2x4s that aren't going to help. Are there any special rules for adding siding to a porch, or anything else I should know about?\n\nI would get some of the metal screen that you attach to the roof. You can get it at the hardware store and the cost should be $12-$15 bucks. Put it on first and then screw it down with some extra-strong aluminum screws. When you are finished you could cut some of the screen and frame off and place around the area where you need the support for the siding.\n\nWhen I was putting down exterior panels and doors I used to do the same thing. It is quite convenient. You can get it cut to size as well.\n\nA little less expensive. A 2x10 will be less than 1\/16\" so it would actually be cheaper and you won't have to rip up the porch. Plus, 1\/16\" would be at least 6\" and a 2x10 is only 4\". Unless you have the money and time of course.\n\nI'm not in a position to rip out the whole porch or replace siding, but your idea of attaching the 2x4 trim board to the 1x6 siding and then adding metal screen is the kind of stuff I was looking for.

The author has written two other books, One Dead, One Wipe Out and The Fourth Door.\n\nReincarnation Exists! \u2013 Paranormal for Young Adults\nBy Gary B. Nelms\n\n\u201cIn a world where everything that can be bought is bought, where corporations run the country and the rich get richer, it\u2019s hard not to feel cynical about how things work. But if you\u2019re like me, you know that good often wins in the end... and as much as I love to look for the good today, sometimes I just want to believe that someday we\u2019ll all win. And the best place to believe? In reincarnation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first in a trilogy of books that will appeal to teenagers eager to learn about the paranormal but wary of the dark side of existence.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Kirkus Reviews\n\nThe first book in this fascinating trilogy is filled with thrilling stories, intriguing mystery, and fascinating characters.\n\n\u201cA first rate sci-fi tale with many elements I enjoy such as the paranormal, an unusual premise. If it\u2019s not the best tale you\u2019ll ever read, it\u2019s one of the best.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Joe Hill of Heart-Shaped Box\n\nIt was the summer of 2006 and I was a senior in a small town high school deep in the Rocky Mountain West. I was a football star, and the hottest quarterback in town.\nI was dating a beautiful cheerleader too.\n\nThen everything changed. My world fell apart.\n\nMy friends turned against me. My girlfriend dropped me like a hot potato.\n\nI found myself standing on the brink of a precipice.\n\nTwo hundred miles away, my future flashed before my eyes. A future I once thought I\u2019d spend in the same small town where I grew up playing football, with the same beautiful girl by my side.\n\nAs my future flashed before my eyes, I saw my destiny.\n\nThere was just one problem.

Describe the life of one of the powerless, and how the empowered affect his life.\n\nThe ordinary people are affected by 25 % of superpowers that manifested around them.\n\nA super power may have good or bad effects on an ordinary persons life. As the ordinary persons can not use his super power to hurt others, he is afraid of what others might be doing with the super power. He will feel helpless in front of people with superpowers.\n\nThis will cause a super power to appear\n\nThis happens when an ordinary human makes a wrong turn in life. For eg, an ordinary person had lost his job, that causes him to develop a super power.\n\nAnother way to cause to appearance of super power is to be exposed to a certain element :\n\na. Sun\nb. Water\nc. Wind\n\nWhich super power did you obtain?\n\nI had wind super power, which is use to control winds.\n\nOther effects of the super power on an ordinary person.\n\nAs a super power can not hurt others, ordinary people have to live and work together with the super powerful people. People with super powers may try to take advantage of the ordinary person. They may feel inferior to the superpowered people.\n\nWhy would an ordinary person have super power?\n\nFor survival. During the initial stage of evolution of the human society, they were not developed enough, and this could cause them to turn to other animals to survive.\n\nHow did you cope with that kind of situation?\n\nI try to get into the right profession to get used to it.\n\nWhat will happen to the ordinary people?\n\nThey will have super powerful people to live and work with. They will have to work together to survive. If they want to work together, they will have to live together.\n\nWhat was the effect of the super power on your everyday life?\n\nAs I have no super power myself, I had to live alongside superpowered people.\n\nDescribe the life of one of the ordinary people,\n\nAs a superpowered person tries to show what he can do, people will think he would be powerful.

I have watched all the popular shows, the movies, read all the comic books out there and even created a zombie board game (which got me a bad review from my friends... LOL). But this show does something to me that no other show that I have ever watched (including the popular Walking Dead show from AMC) has ever been able to do. It is extremely tense throughout the entire episode.\n\nThis show is set in a post-apocalyptic world so it takes some time to get used to all the different types of zombie that can be found. However, after awhile the different types of zombies all start to blend together and it all becomes normal to viewers. I won't go into details because spoilers. One of the things I absolutely enjoyed about this show was the fact that it took place mainly in one location. It showed how the characters adjusted to the new normal through the process of elimination. The characters in the show actually have to pick and chose which things they will do and when they will do it to save themselves or their loved ones.\n\nOverall, this was a great show that doesn't disappoint or slow down at any point. This may not be for everyone, but for those of you who love the suspense, this is definitely your type of show.\n\n4 of 5 people found this review helpful.\nWas this review helpful to you?","token_len":556,"entropy":[10.5652,2.8868,8.5779,2.9471,6.0664,6.8485,8.3285,1.0837,1.39,8.2868,1.7469,0.2692,0.3634,2.8797,3.5194,2.3348,0.609,3.5264,0.2274,2.7553,1.5587,2.8055,0.6657,10.8453,0.3353,15.7373,14.1181,1.0362,7.4806,6.4204,4.7309,7.3813,0.1157,2.1734,3.6041,2.5394,3.9284,1.8617,1.4441,0.0771,6.306,3.6604,3.2584,5.1249,8.2843,2.2082,0.0048,0.1639,1.429,0.003,4.6884,5.9955,4.0438,3.6034,1.4157,0.8657,1.7951,3.1645,2.5074,0.9537,1.7133,3.1481,5.0927,0.1167,4.3452,2.3584,5.7157,1.0375,4.0559,0.0185,1.1578,0.9963,1.2431,2.8296,5.6803,1.7915,2.1651,0.7577,4.1571,2.193,0.8232,0.2613,4.6196,4.409,7.2612,2.3413,4.5065,0.8886,1.5912,2.196,0.6476,2.954,4.0054,1.9902,1.3154,3.22,0.4646,0.0159,0.0033,0.0026,0.4206,0.0001,1.6877,3.727,0.0131,7.1774,2.4094,5.8119,3.6429,2.1116,0.8322,3.9831,0.0723,3.3162,4.3995,5.143,4.5129,4.1722,1.0596,2.754,1.9454,3.6342,0.5271,1.5884,8.8115,2.7211,0.7143,4.7577,2.3092,5.4808,0.1764,1.7243,4.1034,0.4145,0.743,3.4899,2.5228,3.1252,6.9052,0.4034,1.4931,3.5262,3.7595,0.3448,0.9836,2.0758,1.8539,3.6189,3.1607,3.0921,0.3556,0.0144,0.0063,0.0009,0.2014,0.0001,6.3365,0.7977,3.3941,2.7417,3.9591,0.4747,0.5448,1.7948,7.329,4.7584,2.1401,5.9315,0.0999,0.5755,1.3334,0.3653,9.3486,6.1183,2.6047,3.7472,0.8081,1.6003,7.1205,1.0694,4.9671,4.9865,1.4903,4.4252,6.3467,4.4572,5.5779,4.3826,5.27,5.3443,5.5914,1.9475,6.6127,1.5666,2.1357,6.0316,0.1174,0.0107,0.0088,0.0008,0.2225,0.0001,8.7937,2.6809,2.4711,0.0001,2.004,3.0152,0.2172,2.1556,1.8045,2.0341,6.9569,6.6705,1.5845,0.9606,4.4068,3.098,2.8744,2.4025,0.4725,0.7445,5.3194,2.5367,6.4218,4.0921,3.4228,2.8105,3.9656,2.8656,0.2201,2.5747,2.8093,5.5306,6.3398,9.1372,1.0519,1.6509,4.8544,0.0139,2.6378,3.157,1.507,1.8375,4.5022,0.5904,0.9138,0.403,3.7356,0.0204,6.6014,4.5289,3.7585,3.0942,8.0383,6.3594,0.0002,5.8851,4.8756,0.4529,0.023,0.3449,0.0001,9.3413,2.5707,0.2848,0.0001,5.0817,5.1308,5.5955,0.9861,0.6923,2.2174,3.3711,2.136,0.1901,2.4206,1.4681,1.0078,1.0551,2.0359,3.7999,3.591,1.4614,6.1216,2.0621,1.9838,4.6602,1.8916,0.4188,8.4576,1.4641,0.1671,3.859,0.1974,7.5927,0.0579,1.7752,3.4525,5.4553,1.4138,2.7085,5.344,0.3995,3.7383,3.0567,6.521,0.7053,3.3931,7.3196,3.3822,1.9789,2.5928,2.265,3.1871,8.6426,0.8217,1.9315,3.8285,4.9266,3.8778,4.6095,4.8685,1.7566,1.2381,3.5208,0.5653,0.5783,4.4185,0.3435,0.7071,1.1545,1.7125,2.9938,3.3931,1.7934,4.8807,5.8079,0.004,2.7465,5.2733,2.2002,1.0857,1.0646,3.393,4.7699,0.0677,0.0018,0.5281,0.4085,1.6248,1.6531,5.1958,6.3317,8.2918,1.1314,1.6379,1.4882,1.579,3.7357,0.0002,3.9666,0.9044,0.8914,4.8913,0.3196,1.1844,2.7597,0.4247,0.0489,0.0329,1.078,6.2768,1.9391,3.8528,3.9902,1.7539,0.3128,1.0858,1.0509,0.0068,4.4083,0.4593,2.5149,3.7649,0.0153,2.4252,4.0218,2.5474,1.4423,0.9977,1.4688,2.8992,0.2262,4.4074,5.0648,2.3562,7.0402,0.4965,0.3197,0.4341,5.7105,2.1021,0.3555,5.2395,0.6557,1.1842,2.9478,3.94,1.185,7.717,3.2847,11.9206,0.8993,2.4215,5.9356,0.0032,2.2468,0.2129,2.5462,3.7579,7.3371,6.2735,6.2297,1.2436,0.2379,1.7332,1.0784,6.1588,4.5146,0.434,0.5069,0.1278,0.9514,1.1343,1.8432,0.0425,1.2102,3.3751,1.7231,9.1199,0.3571,4.753,2.8347,1.0801,2.1438,6.5312,2.4082,2.208,3.0529,10.1369,0.8612,1.2758,2.2605,5.9049,7.4788,1.4317,4.2036,0.1629,7.0894,0.7201,2.2167,3.2322,3.5894,1.4256,0.4215,4.4762,3.2318,3.155,7.0733,2.5061,4.6406,1.6078,4.355,1.0371,3.2367,2.9693,2.0693,3.3658,1.4516,0.6628,0.7122,0.6718,4.1723,2.7406,2.924,2.3471,1.6138,1.7398,0.0266,0.3916,2.1072,0.0002,4.734,0.4174,1.2903,3.602,0.6632,1.7758,0.435,1.6743,6.4843,0.0014,2.9846,4.4834,5.2718,0.3117,3.9024,5.3627,0.6031,0.3416,4.2491,5.1369,1.7999,0.3508,3.616,0.1628,0.8231,0.2475,2.4658,1.2547,1.4869,0.4644,0.4333,2.6843,1.8688,7.0889,1.5749,1.7567,0.9237,1.997,3.4406,6.1191,0.1327,0.0706,0.5128,0.9892,0.0002,6.6343,2.2193,1.1494,0.9994,0.0004,0.0104,0.0004,0.0076,1.5712,0.1923,22.374,0.0791,0.0666,0.0088,0.348,0.0285,0.0076]}
{"id":627,"ended":true,"length":531,"text":"A man awakens with intense headache and backpain and a blank memory. He looks around, finding himself locked in a garage with 3 people hanging from the ceiling, dead. A fourth rope is snapped, and the knot is around his own neck. He tries to find a way to escape the garage.\n\nThe man is a former soldier. He has a tattoo that reads \" \" on his neck. He has flashbacks, and is a little paranoid. He also has a strong sense of morality that drives him to fight for good, even if he did the wrong thing in the past.\n\nHis name is Ben, and he is played by, the actor and martial artist known as John Wick, who starred in and directed the 2014 film of the same title. The sequel was released in 2017, and now the third movie takes us back to the garage. The last movie has not only a great premise, but also a great cast. Let's see who has joined the three actors :\n\nI've really liked a lot of Keanu Reeves's films, even though I don't know the plot ( and that is very rare for directors like John Wick ) and I have no idea of \u200b\u200bwhat he will do in that film. But he has a great face, a good technique ( he was an excellent and underrated player in movies like and ) and the right attitude. He is not afraid of making a film that shows the darker side of action movies as long as it can be done in a nice fashion and with good intentions.\n\nThe other two members of the cast are :\n\nRufus Sewell plays the man who is supposed to help Ben escape from the garage. But he ends up working to free the garage and eventually dies. When we met him a few years ago, he was playing a villain in the fantastic, and now he is known for his roles in British TV series.\n\nAnd the final character is Ian McShane, who plays Ben's father. His role is important because it will remind the audience about what happened to Ben, but also because it will give us a more adult character to contrast with the younger character. He is the only character in John Wick that is still alive, and so he is the only person that can possibly help Ben. In addition, it is the only character with enough money to buy the house where the film takes place.\n\nI really like action movies, and I believe that this film can deliver an excellent and entertaining story. I will pay attention to all the details of this film, because I am a movie lover.\n\nThe film is not scheduled for release until 2019, but I am in a good mood since I can start getting excited about this new movie.","token_len":557,"entropy":[7.3022,10.835,0.4334,3.3283,7.6033,4.6254,1.1724,6.5872,6.6151,2.2142,3.8979,7.7047,6.4133,1.6927,1.1203,4.0999,1.7716,2.2339,5.3548,3.2795,5.9956,0.5267,0.5836,6.7769,1.6792,7.3002,2.8132,5.9184,1.6976,1.6982,0.3761,2.0383,5.9501,2.2259,3.3227,7.0414,10.2729,1.8251,5.4187,1.7554,0.9434,1.3169,7.9466,1.6171,8.1263,1.1189,7.4076,0.3221,0.2971,1.3567,2.9762,0.2375,4.115,1.4417,0.7074,1.179,1.8096,2.69,2.5703,1.9742,2.0905,0.0057,2.2731,2.7324,2.2881,3.7391,4.7661,4.1538,2.1145,0.5303,2.0381,2.0222,3.8181,2.8503,1.0848,0.5791,10.0311,4.306,0.2835,2.6142,0.599,1.2078,2.3889,6.6945,2.6698,2.3572,3.3464,3.783,4.3744,3.7987,0.8646,0.8175,3.5809,1.0709,1.1458,6.014,2.0515,0.0595,5.2801,3.4658,4.7736,0.179,1.7628,4.1749,2.1095,5.152,1.9905,1.8539,0.8629,1.4397,6.9775,5.6441,0.898,0.0861,3.6193,0.6638,0.9225,0.1209,1.1385,0.0002,4.4367,3.6905,0.2002,5.788,3.214,0.6026,0.4549,1.2483,6.1328,0.0251,6.5636,4.4283,2.6104,4.0212,5.9449,0.6543,6.4971,0.3352,5.356,4.8068,2.7275,1.1277,4.1452,0.2318,5.146,0.8059,1.2603,6.0008,1.8373,5.2783,0.2059,0.0035,4.0392,0.348,2.7152,6.0805,2.4146,1.005,0.7835,3.9531,1.6284,0.6817,5.0005,2.7236,4.6886,3.1317,5.9293,7.21,1.3122,0.1649,0.7944,5.9921,1.0241,2.5823,5.1302,2.4487,4.3465,4.1592,2.8437,2.0403,5.0178,3.4994,0.5278,0.1727,0.9176,0.814,1.6336,1.3358,0.912,6.7551,0.1234,2.714,2.4944,4.2382,8.5148,0.7102,6.2895,5.4877,9.0671,0.9558,0.0002,4.88,3.3133,6.4478,2.6751,5.7829,0.4277,0.047,7.6769,0.2767,0.0548,2.6471,1.9237,1.1818,4.1133,1.0191,1.4227,2.2044,0.0007,1.4613,3.0771,4.4155,5.0372,8.0632,3.8121,2.5863,4.7233,4.1195,1.7191,6.4537,3.7812,4.8471,0.0245,4.0411,1.5754,1.5896,2.9683,1.7687,0.2697,4.998,16.149,2.5374,1.8942,2.0522,2.9965,0.8724,2.0456,3.3154,2.0187,0.3446,2.6699,2.6737,1.8656,1.5181,1.5391,6.2566,0.9319,2.073,2.5809,7.4363,3.3601,3.5938,4.1969,3.8806,3.8453,6.0222,5.0248,8.2382,1.0365,4.8477,0.2164,7.154,2.3013,0.2207,3.7349,3.2739,3.0621,1.3864,1.8136,1.6169,3.8397,1.4385,1.6327,4.2583,2.4503,3.6829,1.587,6.4451,2.2883,6.7115,0.0621,0.1436,8.861,1.348,4.9267,4.7657,0.0078,0.7657,4.2226,1.0232,1.6802,2.2555,0.4578,4.8654,4.9055,2.5809,2.2762,1.7783,5.0802,0.2451,1.2915,0.0006,2.5216,3.2241,1.6988,4.3443,0.3607,0.2474,0.8903,0.8245,6.3169,0.5894,0.0002,4.6706,6.5058,0.0344,6.6816,0.148,5.3795,1.7084,4.9158,1.1214,2.1548,4.7813,0.0023,3.7131,3.0405,1.4684,2.0514,0.3136,0.0955,0.8053,3.4385,1.7082,4.3767,0.0023,5.6095,5.0722,3.801,1.769,3.344,2.646,5.7457,3.5358,0.6912,4.838,4.1601,4.6621,0.7951,4.0993,0.6852,0.733,0.441,0.5132,0.4095,0.8646,3.948,1.2415,4.5108,1.6935,1.0549,9.0807,3.9851,3.8743,4.0097,3.2543,1.1231,6.192,1.3992,1.0319,4.3162,0.5118,8.4347,2.7613,1.1024,3.2498,1.1652,0.0002,4.9674,3.0499,3.5509,3.3643,1.2549,7.5065,2.6996,0.1255,0.0009,1.2547,1.033,1.5238,1.8285,0.7546,2.024,0.958,3.759,4.2157,1.2167,6.2111,0.9979,2.0873,3.7642,6.1323,3.4997,0.5989,3.9527,2.3496,2.9312,0.9111,0.8931,2.0274,3.3433,0.7503,2.323,0.8867,0.8265,2.6785,1.1648,0.6184,3.8797,5.8942,4.4536,2.9768,8.0281,0.5882,1.3198,4.9068,4.263,0.6776,3.0304,0.9719,2.6259,3.476,1.3868,1.7867,7.4008,0.0015,0.8712,1.7101,4.404,1.9645,1.213,0.7769,4.4417,1.7929,1.2955,2.3328,1.3645,2.4848,1.8004,2.0791,5.5148,3.0637,0.4396,1.751,4.4792,2.4963,0.5861,3.1902,1.4977,2.8062,1.0084,0.5891,3.6411,5.8621,5.0666,0.428,1.869,2.3353,2.8468,5.3581,2.3115,5.7492,1.4162,0.0108,0.5932,0.7528,0.0003,2.5827,3.2066,1.065,8.7525,0.5918,1.0928,0.8245,0.9777,4.6793,0.7438,3.1392,2.0072,4.0038,5.0254,4.201,3.8332,3.7764,3.1495,2.7201,0.7776,1.6617,3.4243,6.8959,1.6867,0.1144,2.4431,0.9273,3.1375,1.473,1.54,1.052,1.3514,3.1586,0.9027,2.4106,3.116,4.937,2.8567,1.4329,1.4537,0.0004,3.0273,3.0646,1.1831,4.152,4.8264,1.295,0.1307,0.4621,2.7174,0.8918,0.7358,1.234,1.9276,4.8938,2.5784,2.1134,1.0976,6.3295,0.8095,3.5657,5.1126,4.3982,1.6187,0.7329,1.9202,3.0537,1.9806,1.014]}
{"id":390,"ended":true,"length":515,"text":"A road trip story, told in postcards, takes center stage in \"The Longest Ride.\"\n\nIn a story that's based on a true story, a Texas rodeo bronc rider falls in love with another woman during a cross-country trip. A motorcycle accident on her side of the country puts the two back together \u2014 and the drama from their previous relationship begins to rear its ugly head.\n\nThis story is told in a unique way: by sending along postcards of things that happen along the journey. From the moment he hits the road, the man receives postcards from his new love interest in her own hand.\n\nThe man loves every moment he spends with her, but he has deep reservations about her \u2014 and she has doubts about him. \"The Longest Ride\" has drama, romance and suspense. A strong plot, and excellent performances will keep you riveted to the screen right until the end.\n\nThe movie shows how love can grow even stronger with time and distance. And, it shows how love can have an unpredictable and sometimes destructive effect.\n\nCasting the film was quite a challenge. The writer and director searched for several months, but found just the right people.\n\n\"It was tricky because we were going for a specific type of character. And, you can't really play that type of character without meeting the physical requirements,\" said actor Michael Angarano, who plays the man in the beginning of the story.\n\n\"The Longest Ride\" was filmed in the Texas panhandle, in El Paso and in other southern locations.\n\nA strong storyline, and excellent performances will keep you riveted to the screen right until the end.\n\nThe man has a job that keeps him on the road as much as he can. This job leaves him with little time with his son and his new love interest, who are constantly on the road. She gets pregnant along the way and gives birth in a hotel room. The baby is sent off to be raised in the next closest town to where they were. He returns at the end of his trip to her and his son.\n\nThe two live happily ever after and, in time, he finds out that his son had been raised by his ex-wife after all.\n\n\"I think that the main theme is that there doesn't have to be a right answer,\" Angarano said. \"I think it's more about the journey and where you take your life on your own terms. It's about life and love. In the end, they end up in places better than where they started.\"\n\n\"The Longest Ride\" came out in theaters Sept. 26. The DVD and Blu-ray will be available today.","token_len":559,"entropy":[9.5536,3.0758,9.1198,2.3453,6.9482,1.5811,8.3134,3.6056,1.5764,5.69,7.0643,0.0172,1.8052,4.7894,1.5942,5.7434,1.648,2.7102,1.7058,1.3641,0.0007,3.2106,2.4087,3.7594,1.7621,2.9445,5.5787,0.2459,1.5735,4.3381,0.1469,0.6397,2.9329,7.3303,8.9731,0.0083,11.3741,5.6221,5.1877,6.7367,1.313,0.0362,0.2332,4.6693,2.5266,5.4354,0.5162,5.2127,0.8732,0.0047,1.7855,0.7941,4.1294,6.3161,2.2703,5.1009,4.2032,4.0132,2.3556,0.0673,2.69,5.0909,2.865,2.8948,4.8835,0.6481,4.8556,1.1459,2.1786,7.4751,6.1856,3.0217,5.7058,3.2864,3.5327,0.7643,8.0036,0.0391,1.4729,0.007,0.4079,0.4351,0.0002,3.9392,1.2923,1.4557,3.2581,0.5706,1.6173,5.5833,0.8692,3.4304,4.5318,8.5898,5.9387,7.4513,0.0234,1.7323,7.0034,1.0752,2.0752,4.1915,0.1994,5.1217,1.0209,4.754,1.645,3.441,4.8545,5.8379,0.5054,1.0474,0.4012,1.5778,4.2084,6.6572,5.3996,0.0439,1.8327,1.481,4.2824,3.7789,4.1159,3.5191,4.8382,4.6738,6.5661,0.534,1.1409,0.0002,2.1754,3.6327,5.3326,5.909,1.9796,3.496,4.8429,1.3286,0.8214,0.9081,2.0977,1.8446,3.2918,7.2584,2.3625,0.1667,1.9634,4.7571,1.1494,2.8303,2.6486,4.9324,0.6821,0.896,0.4916,3.642,3.6579,5.0909,0.0041,0.0065,0.4129,3.6053,10.0476,1.0689,4.4774,0.9133,4.6806,1.3817,4.3574,5.7787,5.6481,1.7386,2.4059,6.3698,2.3976,5.415,2.5444,0.707,3.8887,0.0787,4.542,0.801,8.7208,7.4811,4.1533,0.2978,0.9397,0.2538,0.3573,0.0002,2.4068,3.9645,6.7896,2.4422,5.5713,0.4656,4.7079,4.5508,1.3003,2.6519,1.2526,2.2163,4.5259,0.3434,3.9907,2.6829,3.0726,2.9372,1.1606,3.1949,0.2273,4.8956,3.1159,5.8094,1.8277,3.3288,3.74,1.1169,1.4137,0.6819,0.0002,5.3857,4.2411,4.8582,3.8336,2.3818,5.9467,1.8159,0.9873,1.0135,2.3214,5.8103,2.0735,0.5284,9.4446,0.7114,5.3739,4.2057,2.3301,1.6322,3.3502,4.2035,1.4046,0.0587,4.035,1.7291,1.9035,0.0002,2.6983,2.4293,1.2807,6.9847,1.5403,1.764,1.9662,4.3207,3.531,1.3789,5.5997,3.0492,0.0089,2.8311,2.4855,3.9542,3.1295,2.9895,4.4098,0.7816,2.5753,5.4845,1.7957,1.9903,0.1102,0.4882,2.1336,6.4314,2.3099,7.2899,4.6418,1.6707,1.4789,5.2002,3.8517,8.5763,5.725,5.6684,1.2329,0.3165,1.6188,1.5557,3.4342,1.8157,0.3627,8.2172,0.5838,0.2555,2.9642,0.1204,0.7662,0.0002,1.9476,2.2009,2.4314,0.0024,0.0062,0.1261,2.6698,3.25,0.9045,2.441,5.0216,6.5272,0.0343,1.2993,3.3454,5.5584,0.0453,2.305,2.8436,5.2054,6.3064,5.0064,0.7031,1.4448,0.0002,3.8946,5.6993,5.2128,1.3932,1.2668,0.8807,0.1252,0.1378,0.0157,0.0108,0.0192,0.0012,0.0127,0.0023,0.001,0.002,0.0121,0.0027,0.0084,0.1476,0.5697,0.0001,2.0183,5.4639,3.4786,1.7717,6.4081,2.455,5.1531,0.1556,3.2649,1.1224,1.3766,4.1944,2.3959,0.017,1.1094,2.055,0.6769,4.7593,5.5822,6.7648,0.4595,1.6396,4.2096,1.4032,5.5872,0.6165,5.3645,1.8397,2.2267,4.8295,2.3734,1.2314,1.0319,2.141,2.8244,5.7332,2.3156,0.455,0.9462,0.9498,5.4082,4.2207,5.0697,6.6401,0.4607,0.0176,1.9341,5.0901,0.0535,3.3386,1.6887,4.4141,1.1629,0.9017,2.8138,4.1412,1.2117,4.9339,3.4658,0.3746,3.1598,0.7984,1.6708,2.0204,5.2628,8.6721,2.3388,2.9067,2.8912,2.7464,2.2916,4.751,4.036,5.3302,4.0746,0.8858,0.4967,0.2071,3.0849,2.4503,1.7513,5.5832,3.2432,4.3453,3.4001,1.2633,0.5185,0.0002,1.5229,4.7713,5.9792,2.5102,0.087,0.0258,2.9196,4.2315,2.5025,3.7559,0.0566,3.709,3.446,3.6318,1.2383,1.6138,2.5375,4.568,2.1048,4.3179,1.3528,1.2902,4.5084,0.3693,0.3969,5.9543,3.3935,0.1873,1.0668,0.0002,1.4564,2.0065,1.9124,1.948,3.3331,3.9636,3.9868,2.4366,1.149,3.2145,7.2564,0.0004,1.7455,0.015,0.0123,0.9631,7.7411,1.0878,1.9755,1.0454,0.0007,0.0008,0.1237,0.1404,0.3383,2.9411,0.5074,1.904,0.4327,3.4613,1.2101,1.7588,4.7753,1.7286,5.1875,0.9793,4.0909,1.472,1.5474,5.4559,2.3424,0.772,1.4499,1.1761,2.1248,0.2952,1.9369,4.7853,1.3357,2.7783,1.7404,4.9276,1.6997,0.709,0.185,4.5963,4.5813,0.0531,3.6077,6.7908,6.9401,0.3681,2.3899,0.3457,1.9084,0.8628,0.0906,0.0001,2.6396,0.6332,0.077,0.0008,0.0029,0.0191,6.3299,0.3416,0.9264,1.715,3.8135,0.0069,3.6145,0.9072,2.8171,5.1728,1.9423,0.3874,0.0041,0.0782,3.0595,0.4227,1.3531,6.0997,0.57]}
{"id":4261,"ended":false,"length":531,"text":"Your body was born as a blank canvas. Describe how it has been changed to the masterpiece it is today.\nI've always been a kind of \"body builder\" so that's what I've turned to. Also, I'm good at a few instruments, so there's that, too.\nThat's awesome. I have a feeling  you'll rock the next bodybuilding challenge. What's the instrument?\nInstrument, as in, multiple? I play piano, tuba, and trombone. Also, I play guitar, but it's not my main instrument. My main instruments are piano and trombone, but I use the other instruments as well.\nThat's a lot of instruments.  I just realized how cool it would be if people played a duet on instruments.\nIt really is a lot of instruments. But they all kinda overlap. I don't know if that makes sense.   It takes a while to learn how to play all of them, but I definitely would recommend learning to play an instrument if you're interested. Not just for playing music, but for personal benefits and to teach others.   It's the most fun instrument I ever played.\nTotally! I'm a huge fan of music and I'm a college student. I'm learning guitar and drums. If it weren't for the fact that I'd have nothing to play on and I'd look like an idiot doing it, I'd use my bass for music. I agree, it' so much fun.\nYeah, I definitely could use a bass (or guitar or piano). I've been buying my bass from a pawn shop recently, but I'm definitely going to replace it with my own once I find it. It'd also be useful if I could learn to play the guitar.   If I ever had the time, I would like to learn to play an instrument. Drumming would be my first choice though.\nOh, drumming would be fun. I've played with a couple of guys that played drum sets. The drums are a lot of fun. I think bass is a little more difficult though.\nI definitely agree. I play the bass, so I'd be the weakest link in the band. I'm probably going to just start on guitar. I know I can pick chords on the strings and start jamming, but I'd like to learn the basics first. That way, I should be able to play songs from just about any genre.\nOh, so you're a bass player. That's awesome. I've had bass players before, but every time, it's been in a jazz group or something (or a classical group).

{"id":197,"ended":false,"length":534,"text":"The Reverse Alphabet Game - The first CW prompt [ Difficulty Level : DAMN NEAR IMPOSSIBLE ]\n\nThe Reverse Alphabet Game\n\nI'm sure most of you can remember \"The Reverse Alphabet Game\" that was all the craze at our family Easter dinner for years, so here is an updated \"A\" game (not the silly one with the alphabet soup!).\n\nYou must play the role of a \"P\", \"B\", or \"O\", and will be assigned the job to make a word and use it in a sentence. That means you won't only be able to pick a word like \"Apple\", but also use the term \"Apple\" in a sentence: \"I will use my apple as a poncho.\" Or you can just think of something good to say, we'll see how many \"O\" players can outdo you!\n\nTo start, you are given a list of 30 alphabetized words. You will also be given a list of 100 alphabetized numbers. There is no \"B\" or \"P\" category for them or numbers.\n\nThe game will be set to a time limit (for example, how long it would take me to recite one letter from the English alphabet, but do you have as long as you wish.\n\nYou start by picking six random words from your list, and writing them out. Do not repeat any of the word(s) of your choice. Write down six words from your list of words. If 6 words are correct, you will select one of them and use it in your sentence. (Example: I will use my poncho to protect my apple.) If you use the wrong word, you must go back to your list and find another word.\n\nOnce you have written out the six words from your list, you will now draw letters from the 100-number list. (Example: I will use my apple as a poncho.)\n\nWhen you pick the first letter, you will then start to use your first letter.

{"id":2375,"ended":true,"length":507,"text":"Sunday Free Write : Treasure Island Edition\n\nThe book is a collection of short stories, most of them based around pirates, or the world of pirates, or both. Many of these stories are in-world, so they are only tangentially connected to any canon (so if you\u2019re a fan of the main story, there\u2019s a much lower chance that you\u2019d enjoy these).\n\nIt\u2019s a good and entertaining collection, but there are one or two that stand out as the best of the best.\n\n\u201cThe Black Spot\u201d is the introduction to the stories, and is as much about setting your mind for the ride as you\u2019ll get with Short Shrift Stories. Most of the stories are about Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and the various people they encounter on their adventures.\n\nAlthough most of the stories are short, some are around 3k in length. I would recommend reading them in order, with the exception of \u201cJack\u2019s Last Stand\u201d. I would also recommend reading them after the main story, which will give you more details on what you just learned.\n\nIf you\u2019re really into Pirates of the Caribbean, I would suggest you check this out.\n\nThe short story is based off a game I wanted to play with friends when they were still in town.\n\nWhat I think I\u2019ve found out is that the only time the pirates are real and the rest of the world isn\u2019t is when the ship is moving. Anywhere else and the story is still canon. A good example of this is the story \u201cPiracy\u201d.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m curious what you all think. I think there are some really awesome elements like the whole \u201cPiracy\u201d story line.\n\nI am also planning on writing up a more in-depth explanation and review of Short Shrift Stories. I just don\u2019t have the time. So please expect something sometime later this week or next week.\n\nThe author, Robert Charles Wilson, also has several other short stories in his Treasure Island series and in other stories. I just read two of these today. I got the stories on a kindle from my librarian because they were listed as part of a short story collection.\n\nThat makes a much better way of reading in a smaller unit. The first story I read is \u201cTreasure Island. With or without the Pirates\u201d. In which the whole story takes place in that world, however the pirates don\u2019t end up making it out to the main story. It was pretty good, though I couldn\u2019t get the idea of an island with a school on it.","token_len":565,"entropy":[9.1178,12.6624,9.188,12.0678,2.8316,6.4457,1.6105,0.0511,3.3568,6.0207,1.4449,1.9648,2.8138,0.0146,3.4418,0.2334,2.1764,5.2751,0.3509,1.1204,4.5932,1.9878,5.5009,1.4577,4.4755,3.6655,5.4257,0.6606,4.4029,1.6191,2.2762,5.4096,0.2308,4.6267,0.4801,1.1607,0.3926,0.9039,4.1201,5.6991,5.414,2.1443,2.9625,2.0186,1.4529,4.5914,7.1942,0.5796,2.9363,0.5215,3.7846,7.2503,4.8117,4.6523,2.9388,0.3747,18.6573,8.6603,3.1855,2.2842,2.6079,0.1778,1.5971,5.5582,1.969,0.6586,4.4728,2.0749,0.1697,1.2961,1.6672,5.867,4.5278,1.042,1.5093,0.8243,3.9466,0.0233,2.7594,4.2506,3.246,2.6227,1.421,0.0003,4.3264,6.4368,0.1146,0.1878,1.6563,3.1856,6.4831,3.7395,3.7495,1.6628,2.036,3.0074,0.9753,6.385,0.4027,0.0975,2.7462,4.1289,0.0171,2.9155,3.1993,2.2353,2.8888,0.487,4.0421,0.6099,1.1906,0.0002,4.5994,5.5073,3.9589,6.1757,7.8061,3.0331,7.5449,2.5634,2.2491,6.486,0.3883,0.91,5.9968,1.5612,1.2109,3.0031,5.5695,2.3763,1.2441,5.3701,5.0711,4.0615,4.8529,0.9171,7.5487,0.1794,5.4868,2.0738,0.1905,2.3334,3.901,4.7376,10.6721,7.5153,6.3497,4.7947,0.4779,6.2063,0.4256,0.5286,0.4518,0.7176,2.7063,7.9239,1.8103,1.1117,9.6848,5.1777,0.2864,1.1281,1.8853,4.9769,4.9541,4.4754,4.4053,2.9865,2.7318,2.4935,0.7736,1.1279,0.0002,7.0673,3.5701,0.31,0.39,0.3934,0.5008,3.0369,0.5183,1.6466,0.7739,7.8842,7.6622,6.4464,5.2051,0.0715,1.1599,3.5326,3.2518,1.357,1.9695,2.0214,2.9232,1.8983,2.4697,4.7713,1.86,1.3241,0.0402,6.5753,0.5431,4.5546,6.8606,0.5083,1.1209,5.5863,2.0455,1.268,1.1759,1.3844,3.8922,2.8538,1.3593,0.6258,1.0947,2.2546,4.4483,1.5936,3.894,0.3334,1.3197,2.7277,4.0855,2.5206,0.2035,2.2139,4.0036,1.1344,2.1218,2.9767,5.8562,3.7288,0.644,0.2935,0.0002,3.6807,0.1198,3.2069,0.0783,1.0399,5.2774,0.6687,4.6236,1.3714,0.0908,0.0112,0.7026,2.9992,1.0509,2.3425,2.0648,1.5767,2.7691,0.6316,0.7892,1.0733,0.0002,2.6583,4.8731,0.8725,2.1784,4.034,3.3141,2.4626,6.1834,3.6968,6.4956,0.0831,2.0802,1.5814,2.7582,4.1046,2.5481,0.4991,3.8107,2.2439,6.4993,0.7753,2.0363,0.0002,4.7308,2.1966,3.8708,3.8983,1.6653,0.1167,1.0367,3.0257,2.7628,1.3506,0.2119,2.0897,4.5412,2.6668,2.9427,2.7896,2.144,5.3169,3.7421,2.6512,4.8363,0.7205,0.1799,0.9847,3.5978,0.3912,0.5961,0.1307,1.4489,0.9477,1.7353,4.0665,0.7528,4.6022,1.3621,6.9109,2.3617,2.2434,5.7955,2.377,3.7095,1.1676,4.6541,7.8455,0.8971,5.9094,2.2059,2.3764,0.715,0.5486,0.3922,1.61,1.7024,5.8483,0.6564,3.5547,4.6877,2.4996,1.5275,2.0744,0.7332,0.0002,5.7267,0.5703,2.0991,2.8169,0.0467,2.5853,4.1284,2.7348,1.7775,3.4348,0.3174,2.0653,2.5212,2.3188,3.1833,1.0293,1.9476,3.0104,4.2151,8.3735,5.8243,1.4777,5.8866,5.0063,0.8921,1.5322,0.431,0.2576,0.0292,2.9633,3.9743,1.2679,1.0204,0.0003,2.7297,4.1318,1.9646,5.4171,1.018,2.4421,4.7625,0.7411,4.6203,2.1512,0.2169,0.0313,4.1163,4.3126,3.9032,0.488,4.9217,0.076,0.0032,0.4577,1.7147,2.1543,4.9842,2.8523,0.2767,0.132,0.0301,2.0361,1.3995,0.132,2.9464,4.0641,2.7092,8.8001,4.6963,7.0796,3.8701,2.0284,2.01,3.1128,2.0122,0.9133,0.3283,0.4877,0.0003,3.9199,5.21,3.2385,4.8748,7.4762,5.0995,0.5369,3.912,2.0092,4.7569,2.0505,0.7607,0.1579,1.604,0.8743,9.3942,0.0286,2.1917,3.6891,4.3239,3.1459,3.0054,3.0747,2.72,4.0918,4.6614,5.2132,0.5435,2.0277,6.9703,1.1311,2.5447,5.2311,2.3003,6.9708,3.5104,2.7597,8.3256,2.9943,3.9584,3.1008,7.3629,0.7246,4.9736,1.9991,1.4002,6.8602,1.9451,4.1183,0.003,1.6662,3.3134,0.2623,0.5525,0.98,0.9774,0.0002,5.832,5.1187,3.1412,6.4379,0.4206,4.7621,1.2974,2.1311,5.9089,2.3288,6.7391,7.7159,0.8265,3.7955,3.2117,1.3997,2.4913,1.0457,1.9103,3.7362,0.2642,6.3277,0.0448,0.0256,4.0765,7.0131,7.841,0.0136,1.2394,3.3501,4.9629,3.9543,1.8204,5.1292,4.8298,1.515,5.0409,1.5122,2.8496,0.0626,0.8199,6.232,2.5204,1.6126,6.7002,2.1274,2.6647,3.0652,0.8781,0.1247,0.0076,6.016,0.13,4.421,0.6032,3.0533,3.5398,0.9415,4.2011,1.2495,0.689,3.3055,2.9271,3.9575,2.966,1.4848,2.3068,2.4141,4.4103,0.3218,0.1229,0.0007,1.9155,2.1024,4.1704,1.0175,4.8571,3.397,3.8591,1.6297,8.5617,4.1292,0.4319,0.625]}
{"id":2780,"ended":false,"length":530,"text":"A secretive love blossoms between a well-known blogger and the NSA agent who tracks his\/her every move online...\n\nCynthia Lee is an online sensation best known for her \"Ask Cyn\" videos, which have more than 1.5 million subscribers on YouTube. The videos, which range from dating advice to beauty tips, teach teens how to avoid pitfalls and pitfalls so that they not only live well, but also \"live smart\" - and she shares everything she's learned along the way.\n\nLucky and popular, Cynthia is a woman with everything: a high-powered job, a loving husband, and a beautiful home. Then the unthinkable occurs: her husband disappears and everything she once had slips away. Now, as she tries to rebuild her life - without her husband - she must decide just what she wants. Is she truly happy without him or does she need him in order to be happy?\n\nLogan is a high-ranking member of the NSA, working closely with Cynthia. She's his next assignment - a blogger with a large online following. Cynthia has had relationships in the past, but she's not looking to get back on the dating scene anytime soon. What she needs is a friend and Logan is the perfect person for the job.\n\nWith the help of an NSA-friendly hacker, the two navigate a secret online relationship. As their relationship advances, they learn of both their vulnerabilities and their true feelings for each other...all while keeping their relationship alive when they're apart.\n\nIt was the most romantic story that I read in a long time! I was laughing and crying right along with Cynthia. Her world was so tiny, and she seemed to be fighting with her past and present, but also with her growing feelings for Logan. I loved to see the friendship between them grow as well as the romantic one - and I was happy to see that the happy ending was well earned!\n\nI love the cover of this book. It's so different from what else is out in romance these days. I absolutely love the contrast of the pink in the cover against the yellow background.\n\nHere are some other covers that I like better, especially the one for \"The Love That Never Left\". It's definitely more fitting as a cover for an urban romance. But it's also got a nice, retro feel to it, and a look that makes a picture book version of the story work.\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment\n\nHi!

{"id":1594,"ended":true,"length":485,"text":"You have just died and went heaven. Unfortunately, it \u2019 s not your ideal heaven. In fact, it \u2019 s no one \u2019 s model heaven, save for the person who got there first. There have been some interesting missteps, such as a massive plague that wiped out half the world, and an enormous, all-powerful computer that can \u2019 t quite figure out how to end an infinite universe. But now you \u2019 re here. What can you expect? Well, if heaven \u2019 s a place, then hell, as Milton said, is a place. At the very least, if nothing else, it \u2019 s a chance for you to play with reality. So strap on your skates and get ready to explore the place that \u2019 s not exactly... heaven. But don \u2019 t expect an angelic playground.\n\nThe Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald \u2019 s much-loved novel of Jazz Age excess and American dreams is celebrated by millions of readers and has inspired many films, including Baz Luhrmann \u2019 s lavish 2013 interpretation. In Daisy \u2019 s Book, the great twentieth-century British novelist and playwright D. H. Lawrence takes readers on a tour of Gatsby \u2019 s wildest dreams and the consequences of their failure. A tour that culminates in Daisy s ultimate disillusionment.\n\nH.G. Wells came to prominence as a writer almost at once, with The Time Machine being published in 1897 at the age of twenty-five. His subsequent novels -- The Island of Doctor Moreau and The War of the Worlds -- both made immediate and substantial impact on readers, and the subsequent mass publication of the Time Machine in 1898 led to the most famous of Wells \u2019s popular works.\n\nThe author of such masterpieces as The House of the Seven Gables, The Woman in White, and The Island of Doctor Moreau, D. H. Lawrence was, as the great critic Harold Bloom called him, \u201cthe quintessential English novelist\u201d. Through Daisy \u2019 s Book, Lawrence invites his readers into Daisy s dreams and imaginations and shows them in the starkest possible manner how they can lead to a most tragic end. Like Gatsby, Daisy \u2019 s Book shows us the results of an excess of \u201cpassion\u201d and an overweening belief in one \u2019 s own strength at the expense of all else.\n\nDaisy \u2019 s Book is the perfect summer read after you finish reading Gatsby.

{"id":761,"ended":false,"length":526,"text":"The Lonely Knight\n\nThe Lonely Knight is an Arthurian romance novel by the English writer Lady Jane Grey, the third of the four books of her cycle of King Arthurian romances The Lady of the Lake. It was first published in 1840 by John Murray in London and then in the US by Dodd, Mead. It forms a sub-cycle of the Lady trilogy, along with Lancelot of the Lake and King Arthur and the Holy Grail. In later reprints it was split into two individual books.\n\nContent\nJohn Clapham describes The Lonely Knight as \"one of Edward Bulwer-Lytton's famous attempts at writing as a fictitious 'Knight'; in other words a romance with a supernatural theme.\" Most critics agree that the book is a \"romance of the supernatural\" in which King John is the villain and is in league with the evil spirits that plague the court. However, in the view of other critics, the romance should be seen in a wider context of British attitudes towards King Arthur's legends, which were viewed by some as fables and stories, particularly in Catholic circles, which may explain why the book is set in a court presided over by Catholics.\n\nIn The Lonely Knight, an evil spell is cast upon the court, giving the appearance to all that nothing is out of order, while Arthur and his knights have lost their magic powers and the Court magician only pretends to be powerful. There is only one man at court who possesses true supernatural powers, who is the sole hope of the Queen, Elaine de Clare. Her father King Arthur is trying to escape his fate in order to redeem Elaine who has fallen into the hands of her uncle, King Geoffrey of England to be married. But Elaine is being kept as the King's plaything.\n\nThe King and the ghosts\nThe King of Britain is said to have been cursed by a malicious fairy, a nun named Gwenog.  At any time he is not holding court, the spirit that haunts the castle seeks to steal his soul, leaving him to lead a miserable life. King John's attempts to rescue Elaine from Geoffrey are unsuccessful so he is unable to offer sufficient sacrifice required to prevent her marriage. Although King Arthur is eventually able to save Elaine, she has become a nun and, because of her vow of silence, cannot speak to her royal owner.  In any case, she is unable in any way to affect further acts to avoid her doom.\n\nReception\nThe novel was extremely successful and was republished repeatedly. Its success led to the publication of Lady Jane Grey (1904) which was an expansion of the central romance of The Lonely Knight, as well as other King Arthur romances.\n\nExternal links\n\nThe Lady of the Lake Online Text\nA history of The Lonely Knight","token_len":569,"entropy":[12.2466,5.7537,2.1052,0.0032,2.5042,1.8928,0.2272,1.6693,2.0994,8.8386,0.0475,5.6123,2.0623,1.5259,4.1725,5.5283,1.8706,7.4638,3.8243,6.4171,1.8643,4.6995,4.897,2.1711,2.3496,2.235,2.4146,2.9162,1.9173,8.0879,2.4114,5.8857,0.0135,5.3795,4.8022,0.0059,5.5655,5.5467,1.4705,0.4656,0.7357,1.6095,1.5525,1.1604,1.5429,0.0762,0.157,7.1085,2.0507,5.2117,4.8705,2.3846,1.9285,1.5083,3.4419,1.5043,2.3484,2.5724,1.5936,11.1382,2.6001,5.279,6.4242,1.6284,10.3448,2.4603,6.1255,0.5501,7.5068,0.5933,1.4304,5.2622,7.5215,1.2931,6.1139,0.0238,9.84,0.046,4.442,1.2231,3.6789,1.1511,4.0523,0.3201,2.6416,1.7776,6.1339,0.1728,0.507,3.4075,6.1182,6.1273,0.6394,1.9578,1.4706,5.9832,0.3565,1.3581,7.2414,1.4912,1.7317,0.9313,0.0002,9.7861,1.0925,23.5786,11.9515,3.3336,0.0302,5.9421,2.823,0.073,0.0063,0.4924,1.0469,3.4267,0.0675,8.0732,7.2929,0.0276,0.0019,0.0009,0.0199,0.0305,0.0213,7.0668,7.9149,1.2538,3.8582,6.1113,0.8841,8.5876,4.9889,7.4493,6.1633,3.5933,3.1663,0.0397,3.6297,6.3485,3.2827,1.3072,4.4584,4.4328,1.8291,7.1715,5.3229,1.7873,0.6013,1.4237,1.5556,0.8169,1.8381,3.9588,5.3755,0.4104,2.0835,1.8317,5.2551,1.8927,3.1323,2.1347,4.882,8.4695,1.7318,2.9413,4.9352,1.3311,4.9868,4.7993,6.249,0.0023,0.9939,3.4032,3.8328,3.1432,4.7102,0.9133,7.0423,0.872,3.0523,0.1479,3.5578,1.5738,7.6453,0.0108,6.0521,1.2954,0.283,1.3208,4.2902,5.434,0.7404,3.9458,2.4305,1.7426,4.5856,0.4056,2.8606,6.3474,6.6596,0.5328,4.5486,0.2332,2.508,7.2659,1.5765,2.8999,3.2997,6.6024,2.0809,1.54,0.8377,7.1785,2.6104,2.2523,5.1758,2.9661,4.4437,1.7124,8.7492,1.1578,1.9937,2.4398,5.0127,4.0634,0.8707,1.3409,1.4193,1.2827,6.7843,0.3779,1.8625,7.0926,7.0023,0.0391,0.0256,8.2534,0.6348,0.5291,0.0002,2.6344,2.2702,0.6711,0.0275,0.6654,5.5444,3.8228,6.2507,1.3724,0.6201,1.1544,1.2172,2.7992,2.003,5.4698,1.2712,4.8366,6.2517,5.9537,3.8145,10.8345,1.3229,5.2893,0.036,4.4736,1.8164,4.0111,3.0962,2.48,0.5528,2.0834,3.8379,5.0126,0.9108,3.5628,2.0744,1.4266,3.6137,4.7429,7.542,6.818,7.758,0.0026,0.1268,0.7342,6.7593,0.9883,4.551,0.6277,4.7207,0.2257,3.9176,4.3336,3.5246,1.3237,4.5918,5.8405,4.8675,0.2863,0.9312,3.9934,1.299,2.3933,5.6581,5.6221,0.7159,1.8546,4.9829,1.833,8.8669,6.5927,6.6839,1.4996,5.0354,4.039,5.5536,0.6753,1.4226,6.9224,0.0573,4.5586,3.0032,4.3938,2.7048,2.2429,0.0321,5.7623,5.9884,5.5275,1.7253,3.1469,1.7194,0.9698,1.1335,0.0008,3.554,3.6949,1.5308,2.26,6.8242,1.638,4.0122,7.1722,3.057,4.6963,2.769,4.2884,2.7283,1.363,4.6043,3.9597,2.8286,3.6191,4.5873,0.2344,9.682,0.1172,3.1119,1.5539,0.0002,1.4468,3.6583,2.8075,1.5818,11.447,1.438,15.9361,2.3339,2.8592,6.5092,1.3766,4.5333,0.023,0.7101,1.5864,5.4903,0.6156,2.5563,7.6054,5.6139,2.1818,3.7611,8.0262,1.8813,5.0612,2.2778,10.7991,1.7841,10.9275,9.4792,4.9284,3.8966,2.161,2.676,5.2253,8.1933,3.276,1.0637,4.283,5.7113,3.8454,2.4185,0.0002,1.7885,1.0035,7.0559,0.7739,3.6608,0.7956,2.6834,1.6707,4.051,1.0873,1.546,5.5703,1.114,4.5322,0.1695,1.0077,5.2838,3.8468,3.1002,5.8591,0.4269,4.174,0.3995,2.6749,7.6213,2.0289,3.2493,6.3581,0.7859,2.2998,4.9782,0.0081,6.5142,8.4635,5.0884,10.6351,0.9666,3.9947,1.3385,7.9252,0.9964,5.1464,2.7029,1.8786,1.6261,5.407,1.9494,0.0175,2.6359,0.6196,0.8955,3.827,3.1906,3.1345,1.6455,5.121,1.0871,4.6535,4.8877,0.4245,1.0297,6.2688,1.9297,3.1855,0.3447,4.4496,2.7203,1.5474,1.8989,9.0915,9.4381,0.5736,5.8902,3.6204,5.8821,0.9625,0.1995,2.2533,1.0689,4.1571,7.7621,1.6404,0.1548,0.0126,7.1991,7.5888,8.1365,6.1014,6.1739,2.1328,4.2569,0.4033,0.5878,0.0002,6.8867,1.4707,0.0915,14.996,3.1653,1.4414,6.1329,2.7112,2.0047,2.3341,5.8001,0.1932,6.9499,2.1629,4.4171,2.1568,3.0487,0.5588,1.7627,1.7035,0.0834,7.475,0.1897,0.215,5.4844,1.7425,5.1231,1.1065,3.2925,1.4028,3.6426,6.722,0.3291,0.6533,9.7936,3.9223,1.2852,1.2225,0.9833,0.0095,1.8847,3.5269,0.3063,0.002,3.5268,4.5131,0.0519,3.0921,0.004,1.0536,1.5683,0.0002,7.0689,0.5482,0.6909,0.0003,1.9376,4.1215,0.1767,0.0625,0.0298,8.1781,8.5249,2.9372,16.1241,6.1506,0.0617,1.5666,0.2319,0.0123]}
{"id":3317,"ended":true,"length":480,"text":"Describe what led the character to say...\n\nThe character is walking along a street. She notices a beautiful young woman walking toward her, talking to a man, and decides she has to meet this woman. The problem is she is only interested in the girl, not the man. She decides to follow the man home and find out why.\n\nIn your dialogue, use adjectives or other modifiers to make the character more appealing and to explain her intentions and feelings. In one sentence, one modifier might be all that is needed. For example:\n\nGirl: \u201cOh, that\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\nCharacter: \u201cNice to see people smiling these days.\u201d\n\nIn a second sentence, the modifier could be a little more specific.\n\nCharacter: \u201cWe don\u2019t get many smiles anymore. All these new buildings have put a damper on all the color in the world.\u201d\n\nUsing words like nice and beautiful is good for adding a certain level of subtle detail, but it also helps give the dialogue more substance. A second modifier could describe the girl and her conversation better. Again, the words could be:\n\nGirl: \u201cIt\u2019s nice talking to him. He\u2019s the only one to ever smile at me out here.\u201d\n\nCharacter: \u201cHe\u2019s got something for you.\u201d\n\nYou could keep going like this. A character that\u2019s looking for a deeper connection can get into more detail about why she is looking for it. A third modifier might be helpful:\n\nCharacter: \u201cHe\u2019s too soft. No one will ever touch you like that.\u201d\n\nCharacter: \u201cYou can have him.\u201d\n\nCharacter: \u201cAre you asking me out for coffee?\u201d\n\nWhen a character uses phrases that suggest action, you might need to fill in some of the blanks. Using short sentences makes it easier to add this kind of detail.\n\nGirl: \u201cHave you ever wanted to kiss somebody?\u201d\n\nCharacter: \u201cWhat? No, why?\u201d\n\nGirl: \u201cReally?\u201d\n\nCharacter: \u201cYeah, that\u2019s not the sort of thing that happens around here.\u201d\n\nGirl: \u201cI\u2019d like you to.\u201d\n\nWhile writing dialogue, remember not to use too many modifiers and not to over-explain the character. Adding depth to the character by making him or her more specific or by suggesting that he or she is more than he or she seems can help add a lot to the plot as well as to the character\u2019s development through the story.","token_len":572,"entropy":[8.2919,3.3622,6.8928,3.3496,7.9817,0.5864,6.3139,6.4716,0.8658,0.0767,3.602,3.0343,2.9855,7.3333,2.6954,1.0098,2.5536,2.3488,3.2685,5.7166,0.7863,6.6196,1.9588,0.9517,2.1246,4.3431,0.2626,1.8862,5.4841,0.7509,1.3477,1.5325,2.8186,1.2357,5.0954,2.9876,2.779,0.5675,4.1739,4.3315,2.0092,0.6299,1.7881,7.4035,0.4443,2.5552,2.0257,3.6766,4.3831,0.0129,1.5853,4.7595,1.4379,1.5561,0.6895,0.4045,0.3247,1.2899,2.5286,0.3073,3.4503,1.1786,0.8636,5.7643,1.7285,3.2096,1.273,2.7754,2.3639,1.4208,0.0003,3.6843,6.3216,6.9571,0.9814,8.7358,7.5809,0.008,3.7747,4.4981,4.2572,0.7985,4.1151,1.4423,1.6259,2.926,4.3803,2.9169,3.0731,3.883,2.672,4.2793,3.2935,3.2335,0.2985,4.0762,5.2677,2.1563,0.4928,6.9783,4.1339,3.7285,1.0432,6.632,2.6736,1.4058,0.3728,1.3055,2.2934,0.1265,1.4914,0.5998,0.0003,5.9055,1.2684,10.5591,7.3008,6.3841,0.9852,3.1176,11.1641,9.7259,4.1615,2.5742,0.9989,4.2016,6.4506,0.904,0.0002,6.0322,0.0512,0.5339,0.9129,5.5018,2.8704,3.5161,8.2323,5.037,8.2,0.0249,0.349,0.828,0.6746,0.1245,0.0002,3.22,2.6625,3.3797,0.1885,0.2348,2.1812,2.0812,2.6595,0.297,2.6094,3.5376,0.5836,2.2542,1.119,1.9043,0.0002,3.5624,0.0392,0.2947,0.5672,5.2076,3.7561,4.9851,4.9314,0.4894,4.1679,4.9833,2.2452,5.4703,0.2882,8.8681,4.035,5.2763,8.179,3.1229,7.016,1.6089,2.9257,0.0001,0.0506,3.4748,1.8056,10.6821,3.9308,1.0162,0.9219,0.2803,0.6968,0.2306,0.1033,0.0003,6.6262,5.5116,1.4515,6.4849,1.9183,3.5995,3.0521,4.5273,1.1749,5.7506,1.7084,2.876,2.8744,0.0043,6.9484,7.8646,2.8262,0.9145,1.1858,2.7826,3.66,4.1652,0.7339,6.8809,1.9337,4.176,0.5339,4.0929,5.0965,1.2132,1.3019,5.4375,1.1027,5.1981,3.6719,1.871,5.0805,5.972,0.6689,6.5509,0.0838,2.646,4.6086,1.6683,0.5304,5.3694,0.3839,0.0002,1.1628,0.0137,0.5231,0.6746,3.924,1.8679,1.492,0.065,1.129,6.1723,0.524,5.0797,0.645,5.7876,0.4379,1.3664,0.2155,4.1275,3.7073,0.6197,4.1091,3.2696,2.4044,1.6718,0.7232,8.2584,0.9716,0.2608,0.3427,0.0706,0.026,0.0002,0.3695,0.0021,0.0478,0.0485,1.5775,0.9868,0.2707,0.0116,6.7569,5.111,3.039,2.2023,0.6047,0.5001,0.048,0.0274,0.0002,3.6053,1.2064,6.7356,5.3491,4.9897,0.3912,2.9252,3.8752,4.3698,3.753,11.5158,4.038,1.0683,4.8181,1.3289,1.1255,7.9054,3.0423,2.7394,3.8479,3.7348,2.7459,2.7,1.6022,4.3137,0.8786,1.464,2.3144,0.2493,3.0216,0.5243,3.0647,2.0958,0.3742,2.3014,1.1097,4.461,3.1392,0.25,0.0002,2.6856,0.0035,0.0579,0.1598,1.943,0.7814,0.065,0.0201,5.9674,6.0935,1.0126,6.5862,0.8385,4.1638,0.8215,4.4007,3.6501,2.3341,0.4866,0.3246,0.0557,0.0362,0.02,0.0002,2.232,0.0094,0.042,0.0103,3.4705,2.6874,5.5361,2.62,4.2645,0.9104,0.0301,0.0733,0.0002,2.9903,0.0095,0.0927,0.0143,6.2612,0.1439,6.5137,1.2053,4.0997,3.1298,3.5992,0.4222,0.1676,0.0254,0.0339,0.0002,4.299,3.0349,0.6516,3.0658,4.9511,1.6898,5.4941,6.8513,0.7114,2.8028,2.3775,3.5232,0.2317,7.6158,0.5982,1.8352,1.2808,0.5072,3.5013,0.0008,1.1261,5.704,5.9794,2.0845,4.7777,1.001,0.4625,0.227,3.5486,6.3376,2.7444,0.0007,1.3459,0.9769,0.9826,0.0003,8.9414,0.0646,0.3142,0.3666,6.0334,0.1557,0.8498,2.9309,0.077,4.0052,4.4866,0.4622,0.1227,0.0773,0.0228,0.0002,0.0709,0.0011,0.0081,0.0163,3.6167,2.8099,4.6611,1.2571,7.0233,2.0455,0.0947,0.1626,0.0104,0.0002,2.7264,0.0108,0.0434,0.0329,5.8834,0.4076,0.3001,0.1149,0.0148,0.0002,0.1635,0.0009,0.0015,0.0076,3.9183,0.6906,2.7438,2.1064,0.4055,0.3852,4.7526,2.9394,4.8522,0.0095,0.9798,1.7229,2.7798,5.8855,0.2942,0.2736,0.1103,0.0367,0.0274,0.0002,2.3944,0.0045,0.0335,0.017,2.2815,2.364,1.1055,2.2185,0.9178,1.618,1.6197,3.7345,0.2092,0.0359,0.0179,0.0002,7.1018,3.9381,3.6707,0.3984,3.4532,5.3604,0.0243,1.3221,4.122,0.3444,0.6948,3.4854,4.5979,1.5936,2.6648,1.6467,3.7623,0.0558,1.7198,2.0697,1.653,6.6619,7.8111,0.9547,1.2493,2.3241,3.7517,3.9734,7.5966,1.2558,0.0315,1.1141,2.8997,2.882,4.8197,5.908,2.6816,2.6123,0.0746,0.0159,0.9942,3.2595,3.3452,5.5992,0.1182,0.0103,4.0591,2.346,1.9435,3.0793,1.7529,2.6183,1.9892,0.302,5.6154,5.6506,0.5796,1.5423,4.2687,1.1356,2.0932,10.8659,1.5486,1.9425,5.3948,6.781,0.9543,1.3809,0.1278]}

The customer does a fair deal of the work for the shop keeper. Even when the customer is too tired and sleepy to go in or has to use the bathroom right away, the shop keeper promises that it would be alright to just pee in the garden pot. The customer, or should we say the shop, would not mind at all. In fact he would probably tell her it would be better to wait until the customer is awake, since that way she will be able to buy better.\n\nHagrid is a large creature with a long, hooked nose, horned ears and a giant bushy beard.

{"id":543,"ended":true,"length":566,"text":"A new medical technology has been developed, allowing emergency responders to predict the location of the next accident before they even occur. Ambulances are now able to typically arrive at the scene very soon or even before the accident occurs. You hear an ambulance siren approaching you. You have noticed on the news that the US economy continues to grow thanks to low gas prices. Your kids are happy about all the candy they received during Halloween. You are pleased with the snow weather that you have been enjoying for the past few weeks.\n\nYour Life is Normal. You are on the highway heading home from work. Your car hits something in the road. There is a nasty wreck ahead. You find and help an elderly couple involved in a roll-over accident. You move an injured person from the front car to safety. Your team is already there and has already begun treating the victims. The ambulance arrives as your colleagues are attempting to save one of the victims. The victim is in critical shape with blood loss and broken bones. Your team works on them as the ambulance arrives. A person is being brought out of the truck that has flipped over. Once you have all been treated and transported home, you realize that you have been in a serious accident. Your face, neck and limbs have been injured severely. You are told that the accident you experienced was the second accident in a few minutes and that one of your colleagues was the one that was injured in the second crash. The next thing you know you are at the emergency room where you have been hooked up to monitoring equipment to keep you stable and alive while you are under anesthesia. You are told that this could have been prevented with the use of this new technology which can allow the emergency department to quickly gather the information they need to treat you the next time you crash. The new technology can immediately provide the location of each crash, the exact time of each crash and the nature of each crash. The hospitals are now using the tech to help the emergency department staff to arrive sooner as well as help prevent further accidents.\n\nThe technology is made up of a group of sensors which are hidden in each car. The sensors collect various types of data including but not limited to speed, road conditions, whether or not the driver has his seatbelt on. The data is transmitted over the Internet to an emergency room server which can display information through a small screen on each ambulance. The emergency room can then access and analyze each of the data points which can alert staff about traffic patterns to avoid an accident or at least help prevent a crash that could happen a few minutes sooner which will allow the ambulance to arrive after the crash occurs.\n\nThe technology has already proven to be very effective and has been used in several cities across the nation including Los Angeles. According to researchers there have been less emergency room visits and less injuries since the implementation of this technology.","token_len":578,"entropy":[6.4137,8.0575,3.8191,2.3905,1.1969,0.739,2.9864,3.7973,7.1873,1.287,0.1166,7.2151,1.5562,3.4117,0.1997,2.6928,2.544,7.8561,3.8368,1.5315,3.4885,7.2491,0.2417,8.4948,0.0262,0.2234,1.8981,1.8908,0.9092,0.0051,10.3038,4.0194,1.003,1.1344,0.0742,6.5031,3.1687,6.192,2.2092,3.7104,1.2977,1.6963,1.8484,0.6184,7.0012,6.9979,4.629,1.7912,6.1191,0.2941,5.6504,2.2624,2.0619,1.5364,4.1665,7.253,5.7187,1.5588,1.5539,0.7875,1.9094,5.9931,6.4636,5.8885,0.0495,2.0565,6.4142,0.0646,5.2248,3.8776,0.0355,0.6675,3.7277,6.5053,0.796,5.68,3.6025,4.5689,1.2746,6.9326,1.1088,5.5646,4.4929,2.9804,0.5459,1.5512,2.2075,6.4363,1.8577,0.9239,6.8385,6.2629,2.6212,2.2548,1.4663,2.3462,2.1297,3.476,0.7689,0.4945,1.154,1.4347,0.2476,2.5929,0.0296,3.8108,7.8342,2.3,7.2088,2.9165,1.9295,1.2661,4.6401,1.6382,6.27,4.7788,1.7977,1.2735,1.0439,0.5779,2.0686,1.8894,5.1437,3.6138,2.9957,0.3142,0.764,0.7979,4.3684,0.4109,0.6171,7.7809,7.1148,4.9543,0.7205,0.9485,4.889,6.5909,5.522,3.6233,2.0011,2.0003,8.2328,0.0642,0.3937,8.2805,3.4421,0.3879,1.0114,0.3273,1.3474,5.9448,6.4313,1.071,1.4026,1.9378,0.7703,4.4499,4.93,0.6765,4.5991,0.6511,2.1315,6.9636,2.0235,5.6851,2.2611,2.6094,3.71,3.1203,4.6641,4.6775,0.3434,4.3675,0.3791,2.5106,4.1274,2.176,4.7607,4.8826,6.0179,1.4594,5.8202,0.0823,2.3841,5.2321,0.5502,0.4416,1.473,0.3,1.8555,5.0087,0.8984,3.036,1.0646,7.2969,3.6244,5.3023,3.542,1.4798,4.8547,0.2017,0.3767,1.6901,1.2767,4.4484,3.7912,6.4841,2.9759,2.5123,1.8241,2.1315,0.6064,3.9643,5.3381,1.4722,3.2128,5.2467,3.213,0.3984,0.2405,4.2733,4.144,2.6172,6.2065,1.1893,0.6825,6.3962,2.0737,1.929,4.914,6.4077,2.5565,1.2373,2.8034,5.8259,0.4115,0.7026,3.8026,0.6125,1.2518,1.3383,1.8761,2.7032,1.097,4.3795,0.3928,0.4805,2.2299,6.1219,3.8806,3.8502,1.0321,4.3974,2.376,0.5959,3.2273,4.4195,0.4811,1.3017,1.4395,4.2691,0.7935,1.9051,2.1642,6.5219,2.3042,1.4011,2.8672,5.9282,3.2273,1.5028,2.0329,4.596,4.5541,2.2724,0.6584,5.5738,0.7286,1.0801,1.7329,1.8139,3.3492,1.0159,2.4553,1.6714,1.2905,2.6462,0.1932,3.7172,4.0837,0.1203,2.282,4.0813,2.3887,0.074,0.0933,2.1494,0.3502,3.5353,1.0159,4.2285,0.112,2.9661,1.1272,1.7349,1.719,6.787,0.2971,0.5454,8.6559,3.2326,4.0401,3.6522,0.6904,5.0919,2.121,3.8117,4.7242,0.7644,1.4553,4.9259,3.3446,0.1494,1.623,1.1865,2.0221,0.3441,4.2517,5.0392,2.12,0.4325,3.3971,2.9047,2.0557,1.7215,0.0017,3.8904,1.2048,0.8241,5.0942,2.8013,4.7953,2.8374,3.3003,2.3734,0.1397,2.9464,7.2836,2.5549,2.1387,2.2936,0.083,1.0854,3.6289,3.6662,5.6752,2.8335,0.1634,0.6062,5.8917,0.3519,2.5324,4.545,0.5536,2.0786,5.8186,4.2212,2.0189,5.8365,0.3602,5.2417,2.2847,2.9011,2.8579,2.5524,1.4654,1.6484,2.443,0.4134,0.6971,1.0435,6.4034,0.0708,1.3719,0.9822,0.4727,1.8766,7.403,2.0899,1.9935,3.3786,1.4943,6.4517,0.4807,2.4944,3.1665,2.5632,0.6789,6.1183,2.8326,5.8799,5.1795,4.7887,2.4624,0.3779,3.5436,4.3755,2.7194,0.9028,0.3733,1.0945,0.0002,2.1347,5.3902,1.3096,6.24,3.1696,0.0909,1.8162,5.4063,0.032,2.3892,2.5598,1.6391,7.02,1.3814,4.9994,3.1779,0.8021,1.5054,1.1492,5.5187,5.5517,3.0253,0.0038,0.8261,3.1023,7.5441,0.0155,0.0071,0.0021,4.011,0.1586,4.9332,0.9251,0.2984,6.2219,2.9089,0.0021,1.2494,2.8852,1.8772,6.4011,3.771,0.3848,0.994,1.2742,0.9657,2.3858,0.9754,4.0185,2.1878,1.2917,2.5274,1.0874,3.165,4.3577,3.087,6.2204,1.8428,2.3317,8.2895,3.2807,6.9983,1.2717,4.9042,2.1938,1.3368,3.2994,6.4422,0.8533,0.8517,4.1645,0.9921,2.634,0.6074,4.7687,3.317,2.4796,4.4648,1.9516,0.2729,0.9681,4.5742,4.043,1.7593,5.7454,5.647,3.7451,6.6891,3.4421,4.7548,4.1618,3.6546,0.2593,3.1238,5.474,0.824,2.3864,3.0335,1.8138,0.6959,3.8023,0.6896,2.9424,6.0339,1.292,0.9428,5.8387,7.288,3.2269,3.0998,1.1541,2.0526,0.3322,1.2568,6.6759,0.9838,1.3898,5.8678,0.2498,1.0302,0.0002,1.2823,1.8266,2.5429,2.2906,4.6314,1.0191,0.3365,2.1,0.7529,3.1107,1.4448,2.0444,1.0894,1.3887,2.9431,5.3407,2.3955,0.1262,3.8849,2.9319,2.9496,0.0019,1.9065,5.4483,0.0018,6.0169,6.0982,2.1282,0.3152,6.1651,8.2784,2.2804,0.6199,1.8511,2.5524,1.3495,4.6978,0.419,6.0393,0.0289,1.4491,0.4945,0.3527]}

{"id":294,"ended":true,"length":520,"text":"Hoverboard, the electric scooter, washes up on Florida coast a month after they went up for auction\nIt has been a month since a small crowd was charged $10 to watch the auction of an electric \"hoverboard\" \u2013 and on Sunday those people were rewarded.\nAn electric \"hoverboard\" has washed up along Florida's Gulf Coast, where it had been set up for auction.\nMarla Tilton and her husband, David, had driven along the Gulf Coast in St. Petersburg searching for any signs of the missing hoverboard from the auction that had been staged on Florida's Turnpike as a fundraiser.\nThe Tiltons learned that the auction was over after paying a $10 admission fee to the event last month.\nBut they didn't know where the hoverboard was located.\n\"If we can do that, anyone can,\" David Tilton said.\nIn August, David and his wife went to a boat event in Sarasota where they learned about the auction. The couple, who live in Osprey, and Marla, who manages a warehouse, went to the turnpike location in Port St. Lucie to see what they could find.\n\"We went down there. Saw it at first, then the next thing you know we were out bidding and we won,\" said Marla Tilton.\nThe Tiltons paid only $50 for the hoverboard, which they plan to use to commute and for the holidays. David Tilton said the hoverboard will also be a useful appliance at home.\n\"A lot of people take their food out of this big insulated box into the house,\" he said, while holding the box to his left. \"This is like half the size.\"\nThe Tiltons say they plan to keep an eye out for more hoverboards, which they call \"really cool,\" to buy up.\nIn the meantime, Marla Tilton is hopeful the people who bought the hoverboards will hold onto them. \"Maybe they will get a couple more at the next auction,\" she said.\nMore stories you might like on 7News\n3 arrested in Easley bank fraud case Easley

{"id":2986,"ended":true,"length":532,"text":"You are leading the first human expedition outside of our galaxy when you stumble upon humans in the next Galaxy wondering why you were in unknown space trying to contact them.  You are quickly apprehended and placed in a space ship and sent to the next galaxy.  This begins the cycle of time.\nIn time you, too, will be forgotten.  But now you are on reddit...\n>In time you, too, will be forgotten. But now you are on Reddit...  FTFY\nNope. At the end of the Universe, and all of space, there'll be nothing. You and everyone you know and love will be forever lost in the blackness forever forgotten.  The last words you and everything else in the universe will ever read will be...  'FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! FUUUUUUUCK!\"\n>FUCK! *FUCK*! *FUUUUUCK*!  FTFY because I can do that too.    The last thing you'll ever see or hear will be an explosion that will kill everything in a radius of 50, or so.  The universe, everything and every atom in the universe will be sucked into an atom-sized sphere of dark energy.  It will be the closest thing to dying in real life I imagine...\nIt won't be dark energy. If it were dark energy, the expansion of the universe would be stopped. Dark energy is only supposed to be about 21% of mass\/energy but for reasons of space-time curvature it may only account for about ~23%.\nThis is true, but the vast mass of the universe will expand forever.  Everything that has ever existed, will exist, and continue existing forever.  It won't be dark but it will be dark forever so it will be dark to us.  When we are in the next galaxy, all the stars and planets, and the light that they give of life on these places is dark to them now. No stars give out light.\nEven though you're correct, I still prefer dark energy. The universe will continue in its expansion. Dark energy still needs *something* to cause it. Not just constant expansion, like dark energy.\nI prefer dark matter too. It's like dark energy, except the gravity of dark matter (if it exists) will cause matter to collapse at ever expanding (dark, because no light) distances. In a short period of time everything will be gravitationally compact, and thus in a smaller radius. The smallest particles will remain gravitationally attractable, thus not being invisible or even small at all.\nAww, you beat me to it. I was going to make the comparison. Dark matter's potential expansion means there is constant \"stuff\" to suck into it. Dark energy is like the universe as an entity with absolutely no physical existence.","token_len":585,"entropy":[3.8828,8.822,1.2217,5.9598,6.6539,3.0274,6.9932,1.3845,3.4427,4.3933,6.6062,1.6518,6.4345,0.3944,8.7821,2.6372,1.5174,5.8351,6.3855,12.4902,2.0604,2.1239,3.3354,4.4443,10.2328,1.5625,7.5437,0.0249,5.9752,1.8189,0.8192,8.3575,8.8746,1.4717,6.4791,6.5211,1.6012,3.8516,0.7276,1.322,4.5565,3.1841,2.595,2.8849,0.5655,1.7364,3.5268,1.6596,1.4717,1.4976,3.4237,6.9185,1.7493,6.1238,0.1675,4.7077,2.9869,2.1291,5.5593,5.0204,1.9784,6.1424,4.762,0.0925,2.2636,1.6537,6.539,0.9722,1.3096,4.4395,4.7711,1.0246,1.5419,3.6255,12.6279,4.4094,1.4901,8.1161,5.6535,0.9557,0.1285,0.1863,0.0008,0.0036,0.0028,0.0061,0.0043,0.1456,3.3064,0.0015,0.0017,0.0082,0.0075,5.3682,0.2061,4.133,8.2603,7.1159,5.5552,3.1403,6.7709,2.7102,1.0743,6.8839,1.9242,1.0331,0.1091,0.682,6.2147,0.9497,5.3109,4.1071,1.9814,4.2304,0.8825,1.9679,6.0174,0.0986,3.4203,2.7846,3.77,4.3482,3.0086,2.4511,0.7645,3.7759,0.1384,0.5579,1.2866,3.1556,1.7227,2.5546,1.3867,5.3839,1.5958,5.4699,6.4431,0.2904,1.7351,3.5068,4.4106,4.6157,1.0652,4.5869,4.1107,3.8869,2.8336,1.4019,1.0748,0.6627,2.7267,4.8773,1.8673,0.6371,4.0009,4.1244,6.2672,4.3276,1.2187,5.0177,2.3685,1.0601,0.5058,0.87,2.8462,2.4939,0.4459,0.753,2.3017,5.2604,0.7166,3.555,2.0885,0.0662,0.0301,9.4725,3.0295,0.3019,0.784,7.0307,1.6783,0.1085,4.8262,0.0654,1.5109,0.2063,0.8782,4.4192,4.693,3.226,0.0277,8.5543,2.5907,3.3868,4.3995,2.1191,4.2133,1.0594,1.8609,4.272,2.704,5.2217,2.925,2.7789,0.6268,3.0473,0.5005,1.6413,3.5796,0.5726,2.06,0.1508,4.3126,5.1723,3.6326,1.4016,3.0271,4.2966,1.0007,4.6056,5.3012,0.5357,4.7648,2.1464,7.2215,4.5947,0.8827,0.7155,3.0604,3.2779,4.5478,5.4818,3.2396,3.8104,5.6395,1.2748,1.4725,0.5837,0.3393,1.2617,4.2281,0.4562,2.9422,5.1927,2.8685,1.8486,5.0242,1.2806,5.981,1.1347,1.274,0.4261,3.1543,0.6672,1.5607,3.0316,5.0913,0.8119,1.3674,6.1309,4.1725,7.1266,0.4862,4.3826,8.0991,4.601,1.4548,4.3982,4.1449,0.0023,0.7251,6.1631,3.188,1.0743,6.8166,1.4189,1.4336,2.8591,0.8715,0.4532,2.9,8.9734,0.5448,0.799,0.4042,0.2444,1.1427,4.3055,0.8936,6.4644,0.1222,1.7114,3.832,6.064,0.0017,1.1437,5.9099,7.0289,1.6551,0.346,6.8357,6.786,0.9534,5.817,5.1786,6.2508,2.5328,3.1191,2.6787,0.0614,8.4917,0.0053,2.1862,4.7526,3.7989,5.4093,0.0042,1.448,6.9985,5.5993,2.4306,2.8423,3.9126,1.0601,4.9749,2.8769,1.1531,2.8165,5.468,6.4469,0.2842,1.7978,0.6043,2.223,5.0555,5.5759,1.3539,0.7546,6.5094,2.3473,3.4855,0.7169,0.622,3.2441,3.1884,2.5239,1.834,1.1719,5.5527,7.0158,1.4437,0.4944,0.4892,2.6626,3.3248,0.0003,0.9147,2.8023,7.6067,1.1734,0.1158,0.8299,2.0111,5.2563,5.9351,1.7061,0.5401,1.0457,2.6241,5.9866,3.3476,0.904,0.7599,5.0929,1.534,2.6995,2.7646,1.5429,3.5092,0.8986,0.5919,3.7019,2.5142,3.0057,2.1785,1.4027,3.4783,2.3671,2.3357,4.876,1.9976,4.3822,2.4389,7.7065,4.2893,3.5685,3.7924,4.7326,4.0733,3.976,3.6975,4.7967,6.0201,0.7171,6.8906,4.5753,7.406,3.9979,2.0225,1.8141,2.6625,5.2532,2.4596,2.6679,2.0751,8.8693,1.2349,3.6015,3.2192,6.0241,1.9651,1.307,1.2165,4.7146,2.2498,1.4097,3.6411,5.2745,1.7668,4.22,2.0521,4.2412,0.1473,6.1491,5.1005,11.8778,4.4985,0.1653,0.5745,6.443,0.6474,3.0833,6.2617,2.2387,9.4672,1.2523,1.1941,4.1222,5.2147,0.4577,2.2354,2.5498,3.1536,4.9698,1.294,4.6433,5.5381,0.4653,1.811,1.0977,3.3543,2.9977,1.7018,2.615,3.0729,3.0521,5.2846,1.7123,3.0327,0.0646,5.0793,5.1475,1.6584,0.6113,0.4974,1.9575,2.5416,6.2148,0.178,4.7337,4.6453,7.3042,6.5382,6.8409,4.521,5.4104,7.9455,4.8636,4.3583,4.5115,3.957,0.4652,4.6114,3.2077,5.2874,2.0756,0.2159,0.1141,5.0803,1.1255,1.0261,6.322,0.0507,0.0022,6.9746,1.8321,1.7261,6.0693,4.8966,1.633,5.4711,1.7499,1.46,3.4687,5.6065,4.1538,1.1441,4.6249,2.7035,0.1694,0.0005,9.83,4.0796,1.1728,5.7209,4.1554,2.455,7.766,3.057,3.8632,6.054,4.4494,0.2822,0.2591,1.4829,4.2925,9.6821,1.1055,2.8304,9.5443,0.624,2.1259,0.561,0.5084,2.8887,3.7675,3.3369,0.1243,3.8186,3.5084,5.4149,1.9885,4.1515,0.5542,5.105,5.9934,5.5681,4.3843,3.7686,2.0378,6.1102,5.23,6.0565,0.7189,2.7251,7.2762,1.2775,2.2967,0.6998,3.2823,1.7453,1.9059,3.3047,2.9735,2.896,4.3036,3.2603,5.0958,3.6201,5.6813,0.6716,4.631,2.5341,0.7384]}
{"id":4085,"ended":true,"length":552,"text":"You're chewing bubble gum. You blow a bubble. It keeps growing. It won't pop. You have to keep blowing. It ends up being a massive bubble that's about 2 feet wide. It slowly comes down. Is it a bubble?\nThere is no doubt, the bubble is an existence of your own mind. Mind is more like a bubble, what makes up your mind?\nNo matter what, it'll stay in existence.\nYou are one with mind, how will you know when your consciousness and body ends and you become nothing?\nYou won't. Unless you're one with god which if you had even read the Bible that's clearly false.\nIt isn't clear to me.  If your mind is an 'object' in some cosmic sense, you might find yourself in a really bad place.  And the Bible certainly has more than a few passages that speak to that possibility.\nLol are you fucking stupid mate. You may have all beliefs you want. But mind is an object, that mind isn't something that is connected to a god or some imaginary entity. So don't talk to me about where you're going after you die\nI'm not religious; I just enjoy the intellectual discussion, but yeah.  It really depends on how you define an object.  It is something that exists.  What is there to stop that nothingness from being a cosmic version of your own mind?  Then what stops cosmic nothing from turning back into space-time and beginning again?\nWhat's to stop your mind from being a cosmic version of your own mind? Nothing. The mind simply isn't that.\nYes, but what is the limit to that nothingness?  If nothing had any properties at all, it could have no properties at all, and then it would have all properties at once.  What would happen then?\nThere's always a limit to anything. Because time started,there was a beginning. No matter how hard you try, there will always be a beginning. But even once it started, there was no time period called before which time began.\nSure, if you're assuming that 'time' is an event.  And you seem to be assuming that nothing has any defining properties, which I just don't get.  If nothing were to have any properties at all except the absence of a property, it sounds like nothing's a property.  And if it were both a property and not a property in a given moment, then it could be anything.  Or am I misinterpreting how nothing can have properties?\nTime is the passage of events. Mind is made up of events. The moment mind was made up, there was a point. The time you're talking about now is the moment before the beginning of time as we know it. So there's nothing before which the beginning of time began.","token_len":586,"entropy":[5.2846,11.0323,8.9771,0.1013,1.6372,1.8137,9.5069,2.8151,0.9642,2.7569,3.2853,6.0692,4.4044,0.7878,1.5371,5.9386,0.0013,5.9583,1.1503,2.1215,3.6842,0.8427,3.8764,5.1966,2.8561,1.9388,8.092,0.428,2.8672,1.3874,6.9485,3.1407,2.841,2.2226,3.911,4.2695,1.7771,2.5021,0.9596,1.2357,7.3638,4.9255,1.612,1.4309,6.9432,0.9972,2.2838,2.269,1.1641,3.4903,9.7819,2.1726,1.3706,4.6266,3.8739,3.1861,2.7424,1.0188,4.4429,7.3849,2.8248,5.5091,2.0752,4.1753,0.5043,7.4952,1.5045,5.3759,2.7814,0.7246,5.0569,2.7224,6.5167,4.369,4.3385,1.8449,0.3097,3.5266,2.0226,5.4761,2.1563,0.872,2.5201,2.4723,5.5176,3.3645,2.5645,5.121,0.9954,1.3612,2.5276,3.1678,5.1389,2.1091,3.592,1.5611,5.9686,3.625,0.4812,1.5401,2.4347,2.3697,6.2163,5.338,2.5233,8.0945,3.7615,1.1719,3.4963,4.7806,1.2305,0.4472,1.942,4.2791,0.0013,2.367,6.6434,0.4346,2.0191,4.6692,0.696,8.4009,8.1811,6.0036,0.7148,6.8508,7.1181,6.9371,1.5941,1.529,4.7796,2.7412,6.3421,4.7954,0.2869,0.6387,3.5208,4.5648,0.0005,4.5172,2.62,0.1822,3.5748,7.5795,10.713,3.8064,1.1555,0.8851,4.073,6.7473,4.6299,1.2033,3.3038,3.9119,5.2969,1.9442,0.8561,2.4174,4.1592,4.6734,1.6812,1.6709,0.9899,6.2425,1.5357,1.3949,0.4411,2.494,3.6343,3.8153,2.6886,4.9649,3.918,4.5423,2.3533,1.9799,0.7561,3.7945,1.1502,4.822,1.3988,1.1193,3.8128,0.2683,0.9628,6.6822,4.5265,8.4496,0.8126,6.4361,3.312,9.4193,0.8407,2.238,5.5625,1.9202,5.8687,9.4393,3.6758,2.1721,1.9867,2.0539,7.3112,0.8179,2.7834,1.4346,1.3914,3.8892,5.8229,4.1507,0.0004,2.6358,1.7458,2.8102,5.7068,0.3393,3.0034,3.4855,2.1803,4.551,6.4022,1.5347,0.6018,5.1133,3.5532,0.0005,4.5827,1.1891,0.4852,0.8327,6.1702,1.0553,1.7628,1.7535,5.102,1.7021,1.676,5.9141,2.1811,1.6126,1.5105,7.2099,5.5628,0.4937,3.0029,5.4466,2.5374,7.163,4.6865,2.8629,2.65,7.4003,2.3194,1.9564,3.4656,5.2372,3.1937,0.3701,1.6977,0.9309,2.5325,4.7999,1.2568,0.7665,1.5335,3.0577,3.2051,2.8619,0.7058,3.0114,2.6759,1.2252,4.5354,2.0025,4.775,0.4179,5.1781,4.9099,8.8113,1.477,1.07,2.8183,2.3442,7.8094,8.4496,0.0373,2.3958,2.5331,0.2953,0.427,1.3494,5.4964,2.675,8.7971,9.7498,6.8569,7.4051,7.1131,5.7845,0.9551,6.7329,3.7431,0.1218,1.7099,5.7119,3.2924,0.9258,0.7279,3.5745,2.7164,4.4558,0.0277,3.0817,0.6079,0.3148,1.4417,1.3324,1.3382,2.8362,0.0063,0.802,0.2292,0.1154,0.2053,6.7785,0.8587,4.5079,3.441,5.202,2.9712,0.0006,3.4676,3.4389,1.3452,5.6255,0.4291,3.0677,2.8873,2.2353,2.0923,3.9223,1.5363,2.6159,6.9474,0.0036,0.693,1.3401,3.9027,5.2377,5.7815,3.5449,5.0504,2.6688,0.0085,0.5603,1.717,2.862,3.1717,2.1374,2.1654,0.2979,0.0013,2.2148,2.1526,3.181,1.8399,0.9728,2.5501,3.6433,0.9455,1.1144,1.3348,0.4366,0.8969,3.07,2.9505,1.8502,3.6734,0.8908,1.2524,3.5436,2.1104,5.0862,1.667,0.5923,0.6062,4.2476,1.1047,6.4933,5.765,7.2737,3.155,11.5676,1.1292,1.6058,5.1037,0.8925,6.0774,1.2106,0.9253,4.4417,0.4565,0.679,0.8826,2.992,1.8089,0.1788,0.0544,0.5742,1.5435,0.3567,4.0886,4.2399,5.7782,3.0969,3.1966,0.2686,1.87,1.4421,1.5697,4.2718,6.0882,8.4128,7.0483,6.2215,3.0387,3.2985,0.5094,1.2248,6.7203,0.7047,3.4133,0.9132,2.6732,8.7346,1.246,5.8447,1.9703,1.0079,1.4217,3.1353,5.0033,4.3815,0.8748,3.0438,2.5828,7.0858,0.2635,1.4513,2.5449,0.499,5.5877,2.9935,1.177,9.3241,0.5796,1.5485,5.8634,3.4841,5.87,0.7691,0.0006,3.3131,0.4131,0.6302,3.4996,4.222,4.1955,1.8361,2.7103,0.9141,2.5606,0.5925,0.0167,7.5977,2.6998,6.0595,0.0611,1.8489,7.7329,0.5455,2.3755,8.3425,0.5081,2.2807,4.3442,2.6859,2.4454,0.9596,1.0893,2.3014,1.8231,1.8887,0.8665,8.4139,2.7803,0.7548,0.1455,2.2812,0.8636,1.1609,5.5113,2.6705,3.4533,3.4846,0.2219,1.1903,1.4636,3.5973,0.9314,2.9969,0.6514,1.4173,4.3297,7.2642,0.0152,5.478,1.8303,0.0033,0.0001,5.1318,5.5566,2.8074,1.6484,2.7146,1.7215,0.676,5.1103,0.9943,2.8835,8.4366,0.9557,5.4256,1.0547,7.1621,0.4407,7.2495,0.2756,0.0705,1.5573,0.5528,3.3343,4.0149,7.2232,3.6342,1.0716,0.1382,5.4417,3.0819,0.4863,1.1248,3.5576,2.5059,3.0767,2.7668,4.6733,2.5651,3.3659,0.0278,4.0189,0.8482,0.9552,1.1961,3.406,1.9872,3.2734,0.3708,1.8578,5.3112,2.7069,0.998,0.0201,0.3335,3.5159,3.496,1.193,2.2112,4.3735,6.7315,2.7151,2.2301,0.4501,0.3151,3.8395,0.549]}
{"id":2973,"ended":true,"length":552,"text":"You're chewing bubble gum. You blow a bubble. It keeps growing. It won't pop. You have to keep blowing. It ends up being a massive bubble that's about 2 feet wide. It slowly comes down. Is it a bubble?\nThere is no doubt, the bubble is an existence of your own mind. Mind is more like a bubble, what makes up your mind?\nNo matter what, it'll stay in existence.\nYou are one with mind, how will you know when your consciousness and body ends and you become nothing?\nYou won't. Unless you're one with god which if you had even read the Bible that's clearly false.\nIt isn't clear to me.  If your mind is an 'object' in some cosmic sense, you might find yourself in a really bad place.  And the Bible certainly has more than a few passages that speak to that possibility.\nLol are you fucking stupid mate. You may have all beliefs you want. But mind is an object, that mind isn't something that is connected to a god or some imaginary entity. So don't talk to me about where you're going after you die\nI'm not religious; I just enjoy the intellectual discussion, but yeah.  It really depends on how you define an object.  It is something that exists.  What is there to stop that nothingness from being a cosmic version of your own mind?  Then what stops cosmic nothing from turning back into space-time and beginning again?\nWhat's to stop your mind from being a cosmic version of your own mind? Nothing. The mind simply isn't that.\nYes, but what is the limit to that nothingness?  If nothing had any properties at all, it could have no properties at all, and then it would have all properties at once.  What would happen then?\nThere's always a limit to anything. Because time started,there was a beginning. No matter how hard you try, there will always be a beginning. But even once it started, there was no time period called before which time began.\nSure, if you're assuming that 'time' is an event.  And you seem to be assuming that nothing has any defining properties, which I just don't get.  If nothing were to have any properties at all except the absence of a property, it sounds like nothing's a property.  And if it were both a property and not a property in a given moment, then it could be anything.  Or am I misinterpreting how nothing can have properties?\nTime is the passage of events. Mind is made up of events. The moment mind was made up, there was a point. The time you're talking about now is the moment before the beginning of time as we know it. So there's nothing before which the beginning of time began.","token_len":586,"entropy":[5.2846,11.0323,8.9771,0.1013,1.6372,1.8137,9.5069,2.8151,0.9642,2.7569,3.2853,6.0692,4.4044,0.7878,1.5371,5.9386,0.0013,5.9583,1.1503,2.1215,3.6842,0.8427,3.8764,5.1966,2.8561,1.9388,8.092,0.428,2.8672,1.3874,6.9485,3.1407,2.841,2.2226,3.911,4.2695,1.7771,2.5021,0.9596,1.2357,7.3638,4.9255,1.612,1.4309,6.9432,0.9972,2.2838,2.269,1.1641,3.4903,9.7819,2.1726,1.3706,4.6266,3.8739,3.1861,2.7424,1.0188,4.4429,7.3849,2.8248,5.5091,2.0752,4.1753,0.5043,7.4952,1.5045,5.3759,2.7814,0.7246,5.0569,2.7224,6.5167,4.369,4.3385,1.8449,0.3097,3.5266,2.0226,5.4761,2.1563,0.872,2.5201,2.4723,5.5176,3.3645,2.5645,5.121,0.9954,1.3612,2.5276,3.1678,5.1389,2.1091,3.592,1.5611,5.9686,3.625,0.4812,1.5401,2.4347,2.3697,6.2163,5.338,2.5233,8.0945,3.7615,1.1719,3.4963,4.7806,1.2305,0.4472,1.942,4.2791,0.0013,2.367,6.6434,0.4346,2.0191,4.6692,0.696,8.4009,8.1811,6.0036,0.7148,6.8508,7.1181,6.9371,1.5941,1.529,4.7796,2.7412,6.3421,4.7954,0.2869,0.6387,3.5208,4.5648,0.0005,4.5172,2.62,0.1822,3.5748,7.5795,10.713,3.8064,1.1555,0.8851,4.073,6.7473,4.6299,1.2033,3.3038,3.9119,5.2969,1.9442,0.8561,2.4174,4.1592,4.6734,1.6812,1.6709,0.9899,6.2425,1.5357,1.3949,0.4411,2.494,3.6343,3.8153,2.6886,4.9649,3.918,4.5423,2.3533,1.9799,0.7561,3.7945,1.1502,4.822,1.3988,1.1193,3.8128,0.2683,0.9628,6.6822,4.5265,8.4496,0.8126,6.4361,3.312,9.4193,0.8407,2.238,5.5625,1.9202,5.8687,9.4393,3.6758,2.1721,1.9867,2.0539,7.3112,0.8179,2.7834,1.4346,1.3914,3.8892,5.8229,4.1507,0.0004,2.6358,1.7458,2.8102,5.7068,0.3393,3.0034,3.4855,2.1803,4.551,6.4022,1.5347,0.6018,5.1133,3.5532,0.0005,4.5827,1.1891,0.4852,0.8327,6.1702,1.0553,1.7628,1.7535,5.102,1.7021,1.676,5.9141,2.1811,1.6126,1.5105,7.2099,5.5628,0.4937,3.0029,5.4466,2.5374,7.163,4.6865,2.8629,2.65,7.4003,2.3194,1.9564,3.4656,5.2372,3.1937,0.3701,1.6977,0.9309,2.5325,4.7999,1.2568,0.7665,1.5335,3.0577,3.2051,2.8619,0.7058,3.0114,2.6759,1.2252,4.5354,2.0025,4.775,0.4179,5.1781,4.9099,8.8113,1.477,1.07,2.8183,2.3442,7.8094,8.4496,0.0373,2.3958,2.5331,0.2953,0.427,1.3494,5.4964,2.675,8.7971,9.7498,6.8569,7.4051,7.1131,5.7845,0.9551,6.7329,3.7431,0.1218,1.7099,5.7119,3.2924,0.9258,0.7279,3.5745,2.7164,4.4558,0.0277,3.0817,0.6079,0.3148,1.4417,1.3324,1.3382,2.8362,0.0063,0.802,0.2292,0.1154,0.2053,6.7785,0.8587,4.5079,3.441,5.202,2.9712,0.0006,3.4676,3.4389,1.3452,5.6255,0.4291,3.0677,2.8873,2.2353,2.0923,3.9223,1.5363,2.6159,6.9474,0.0036,0.693,1.3401,3.9027,5.2377,5.7815,3.5449,5.0504,2.6688,0.0085,0.5603,1.717,2.862,3.1717,2.1374,2.1654,0.2979,0.0013,2.2148,2.1526,3.181,1.8399,0.9728,2.5501,3.6433,0.9455,1.1144,1.3348,0.4366,0.8969,3.07,2.9505,1.8502,3.6734,0.8908,1.2524,3.5436,2.1104,5.0862,1.667,0.5923,0.6062,4.2476,1.1047,6.4933,5.765,7.2737,3.155,11.5676,1.1292,1.6058,5.1037,0.8925,6.0774,1.2106,0.9253,4.4417,0.4565,0.679,0.8826,2.992,1.8089,0.1788,0.0544,0.5742,1.5435,0.3567,4.0886,4.2399,5.7782,3.0969,3.1966,0.2686,1.87,1.4421,1.5697,4.2718,6.0882,8.4128,7.0483,6.2215,3.0387,3.2985,0.5094,1.2248,6.7203,0.7047,3.4133,0.9132,2.6732,8.7346,1.246,5.8447,1.9703,1.0079,1.4217,3.1353,5.0033,4.3815,0.8748,3.0438,2.5828,7.0858,0.2635,1.4513,2.5449,0.499,5.5877,2.9935,1.177,9.3241,0.5796,1.5485,5.8634,3.4841,5.87,0.7691,0.0006,3.3131,0.4131,0.6302,3.4996,4.222,4.1955,1.8361,2.7103,0.9141,2.5606,0.5925,0.0167,7.5977,2.6998,6.0595,0.0611,1.8489,7.7329,0.5455,2.3755,8.3425,0.5081,2.2807,4.3442,2.6859,2.4454,0.9596,1.0893,2.3014,1.8231,1.8887,0.8665,8.4139,2.7803,0.7548,0.1455,2.2812,0.8636,1.1609,5.5113,2.6705,3.4533,3.4846,0.2219,1.1903,1.4636,3.5973,0.9314,2.9969,0.6514,1.4173,4.3297,7.2642,0.0152,5.478,1.8303,0.0033,0.0001,5.1318,5.5566,2.8074,1.6484,2.7146,1.7215,0.676,5.1103,0.9943,2.8835,8.4366,0.9557,5.4256,1.0547,7.1621,0.4407,7.2495,0.2756,0.0705,1.5573,0.5528,3.3343,4.0149,7.2232,3.6342,1.0716,0.1382,5.4417,3.0819,0.4863,1.1248,3.5576,2.5059,3.0767,2.7668,4.6733,2.5651,3.3659,0.0278,4.0189,0.8482,0.9552,1.1961,3.406,1.9872,3.2734,0.3708,1.8578,5.3112,2.7069,0.998,0.0201,0.3335,3.5159,3.496,1.193,2.2112,4.3735,6.7315,2.7151,2.2301,0.4501,0.3151,3.8395,0.549]}
{"id":1168,"ended":true,"length":530,"text":"You \u2019 ve bought\/acquired a very typical object, and it somehow proceeds to ruin your life.\n\nThe object in question is a digital camera, and a certain photographer who goes by the name of Stephen Wilkes, who is a complete and utter ass-hat\u2026 (I\u2019ll leave the rest to your imagination.) Anyway, he did something called the \u201cPorcelain Doll\u201d photoshoot, where he photographed people in very realistic make-up as porcelain dolls, because he thought it was funny\u2026 and it was. Well, Mr. Wilkes also decided to use said dolls to model for his portfolio, but there\u2019s a bit of a problem as to whether or not he\u2019s allowed to do so without proper license to do so, considering that most people won\u2019t understand that they\u2019re not real people, but rather dolls (I understand that in most areas, it actually is illegal to use any dolls as models, even though no one has ever given a specific law concerning it. As for what it should be referred to as, some have suggested that it be referred to as a \u201cdigital doll\u201d to avoid the confusion of what the dolls are, but that\u2019s really hard to get past the public\u2014 it sounds more like something that you take drugs out of\u2026)\n\nSo here is the problem: when Wilkes started calling these \u201cdigital dolls\u201d, he also started selling the photos of the dolls on his website for a small fee, and started calling them \u201cdigital dolls\u201d. He used the dolls to pose again and again and again, over and over, and made a serious profit while doing so. He also began to send this dolls to \u201cprops\u201d companies, and they started using them to promote products, and began to be paid for it (as far as I\u2019ve been able to find, it now appears that Wilkes is no longer allowed to do that either, but I\u2019m not exactly sure about that).\n\nThe problem is that this is actually a very serious issue. These are not \u201cdigital dolls\u201d, they are dolls. The fact that they\u2019re not real people\u2014 or that they\u2019ve been used for \u201cpropaganda\u201d purposes\u2014 is a different issue than the fact that they ARE dolls.

{"id":1195,"ended":true,"length":555,"text":"When the Hero becomes the Villain\n\nThe hero is the one who starts the trouble in a work of fiction. The villain, on the other hand, is the one who tries to remedy the trouble by, say, killing everyone. But the problem with this view is that it is too black and white \u2013 there are often other motivations behind villainy.\n\nWhich, as it turns out, brings us very neatly into today\u2019s blog and today\u2019s comic. Today\u2019s comic shows two comic book superheroes \u2013 Superman and Batman (or Robin, but that\u2019s another blog), and the two of them have become very good friends. They chat a bit; they have lunch; they talk about how much they both really hate a superhero villain called the Joker, who also happens to be Batman\u2019s arch-nemesis. It gets pretty intense.\n\nBut what if the hero of the story also turns out to be a villain? What would that mean for these two heroes? For our plot, it would mean that they would become mortal enemies. No, not really; they still like each other. But Batman certainly wouldn\u2019t be happy with Supes having more fun.\n\nWhy would that change anything? Because it shows that the villain can still be good in its heart. In fact, it probably believes that \u201cdoing good\u201d is something for which it needs to be punished. Or something.\n\nSo why does that happen? Some villains are sadists. Some are doing it for selfish reasons. Some are religious zealots. Some hate the fact that the hero has power while they don\u2019t. Some simply want to be evil \u2013 it\u2019s what makes them happy. If they think they are getting away with something like that, it will make them less likely to stop.\n\nIn our story it seems to have something to do with Batman\u2019s power. He\u2019s so strong and good that people are starting to get afraid. In some ways they want him to start being less good. Like we said, they don\u2019t think he would like it if Superman was having more fun, but they figure that Superman isn\u2019t quite as good as Batman, so at least they\u2019d get something going on.\n\nBut what about the Joker? For some reason he seems very, very happy in a way that can\u2019t possibly last. We think it might have something to do with his past life as a child \u2013 the whole Joker persona may have been a way to escape the kind of punishment that was often his fate in real life. This is how it starts to come loose. What would a world where the villain was good like? It would depend on the villain \u2013 the Joker could do this world in a very different way from Batman, and his goal wouldn\u2019t always be the same thing.","token_len":594,"entropy":[2.5591,10.2035,5.7441,2.3729,7.3692,0.0273,3.5277,0.0022,1.9668,2.9834,1.871,1.512,2.7464,0.4426,5.4217,0.7249,8.1287,2.7342,3.6544,7.9153,1.0762,1.5095,0.7793,1.9378,3.495,2.7877,2.5573,0.0227,0.0161,0.0026,0.0358,0.5409,0.453,0.4683,0.1546,4.6694,0.1341,7.7604,0.4526,6.2584,1.5212,7.0744,2.5923,0.0111,4.0971,3.2089,1.7707,4.1453,1.863,4.1569,2.2656,1.5873,5.6142,0.3504,0.1124,1.1814,2.3148,5.3284,9.3072,0.3193,0.1641,5.6766,3.329,0.8848,5.9781,4.831,6.1761,2.5774,4.9583,0.5619,1.6465,1.3723,0.0002,5.9661,4.7512,2.8592,3.5514,0.2028,0.001,0.0147,7.1523,0.3337,7.8011,4.629,0.4885,6.0679,14.9925,6.6559,6.9379,7.9219,4.7206,6.063,2.5881,0.0138,0.1297,3.9393,1.0911,4.5215,2.8658,0.0116,0.0193,2.384,4.2163,4.9134,6.5402,2.6016,3.586,3.9309,4.1902,0.2961,0.4713,4.0898,3.0534,5.5011,1.6337,6.1483,2.2511,8.832,0.5841,0.5877,3.0933,5.929,4.5514,1.333,2.7038,2.3186,3.9971,0.0778,2.5407,4.11,2.7731,3.1245,0.7114,0.6688,2.9918,7.2064,3.4732,2.322,5.7541,1.1147,2.8125,5.5234,1.9408,0.2504,2.3747,0.9593,3.7395,2.6538,0.8723,6.3051,4.8965,3.0933,6.2434,3.9154,7.9114,8.4002,2.4914,1.8446,1.8126,2.6732,5.3621,1.3684,0.006,0.1745,2.8498,3.7455,0.0328,0.5227,5.2116,1.2773,1.5327,0.0038,0.0015,0.5199,3.4662,4.751,2.5386,3.5165,1.9032,1.0471,0.0002,1.9064,3.1472,3.0216,1.4502,1.4139,4.7011,1.9323,2.4395,4.8034,4.0719,0.1813,0.0396,0.1219,1.1396,1.8588,1.1821,1.4888,3.1475,1.8576,1.528,0.5006,5.8704,0.2478,1.634,0.3785,4.5584,5.0026,7.0552,0.6488,2.2645,2.2944,0.7594,0.7306,2.1037,2.4065,2.4212,9.108,0.6259,1.5008,5.3752,1.654,2.4785,3.0954,3.5362,1.4292,6.505,6.3908,0.6177,0.0138,1.3296,1.2941,5.7303,6.8308,3.3018,3.7324,0.4099,0.0783,1.2549,3.9355,2.2349,12.4211,0.2007,3.5831,5.5054,3.9629,2.1737,1.3565,0.0002,4.6396,2.7799,3.3476,3.5729,2.4499,0.3673,2.2948,2.6243,5.1695,0.8073,2.02,3.6817,3.816,3.3866,1.0432,3.1727,3.5625,3.93,8.3001,0.9496,3.5804,1.9117,0.0523,1.5773,5.6549,9.6538,0.8173,10.0549,6.4574,7.7161,1.1131,0.1663,8.9616,1.1872,3.7021,5.9159,2.0643,1.442,3.7193,0.2109,1.182,3.531,0.4972,6.1426,4.4043,2.1158,1.4638,0.0002,3.0606,2.8932,2.3247,2.1276,3.2079,0.2746,5.3339,4.7998,1.7778,6.2752,3.8255,1.5343,1.3827,1.4931,8.2799,3.6498,1.412,5.9711,0.3188,0.4019,1.1543,0.5344,7.8222,3.4314,0.0156,0.443,0.5427,6.1825,1.9108,3.9793,0.0244,2.6396,1.6939,2.7768,6.2339,6.4084,2.3828,3.5215,1.5174,0.2739,0.0665,0.7498,2.3142,4.2994,1.3948,0.3284,2.3686,5.7116,4.7289,4.8215,1.765,0.0926,0.0326,2.7745,2.5898,0.2427,3.6211,0.295,4.7233,1.8564,3.9089,1.8018,1.1185,4.23,2.8888,0.0255,3.6635,4.5805,0.5337,0.2089,2.5449,3.7261,2.5866,0.4411,3.7801,2.0729,0.0168,4.8829,2.4046,0.5922,0.0002,3.8449,4.5193,2.7913,5.2031,2.6787,2.3349,3.5172,3.2809,0.2199,0.007,0.0026,3.5029,2.1722,0.0401,0.1234,4.3384,0.9353,2.4592,3.9522,0.0554,0.0429,4.8738,3.9831,2.5062,4.6185,0.9656,4.427,2.729,3.7776,0.0507,3.9461,6.357,2.8769,3.8493,3.5724,0.7724,5.0291,4.6622,2.6508,0.4112,6.1488,3.7198,4.5782,4.6739,0.8833,6.016,4.7324,2.2946,0.3019,2.8162,2.8103,0.4134,0.0768,0.0013,3.1497,1.7402,4.7679,3.9801,1.7152,1.6678,3.5303,2.0609,6.5669,2.1821,0.1969,2.9166,1.9527,1.5376,7.139,1.3166,3.7337,4.0122,0.8884,0.0842,0.0049,5.2697,0.8978,1.2852,0.5001,0.8033,2.2214,1.8357,6.6217,0.5548,1.0258,3.6392,0.0091,2.919,2.8998,4.4598,5.6,4.1985,0.4921,0.381,0.0002,2.1636,2.2981,2.2424,1.4019,4.2306,0.3308,5.4409,2.2799,0.3626,1.8141,2.5677,4.1795,3.1958,0.0164,3.0724,3.2745,4.0742,1.0836,0.2184,5.2913,2.2687,0.0799,0.013,2.6518,7.1349,0.7445,4.8635,3.7785,2.5983,2.9394,2.7721,0.1387,0.0068,0.0074,0.0016,1.4579,4.9059,3.7475,3.0504,0.3904,3.1191,3.228,3.6806,5.6846,2.7337,5.2418,5.6152,0.5842,1.2682,1.8356,3.0279,1.257,3.354,1.9104,5.712,0.0033,5.3062,1.0765,3.8913,4.3797,7.1199,5.1135,2.3246,5.0444,0.008,0.2841,4.7059,1.3935,3.8998,2.7329,5.1366,0.6631,3.9101,10.4644,0.9642,5.0431,2.9934,4.2587,5.4936,0.7781,2.4187,3.4593,1.9223,4.9571,5.0412,1.149,3.2197,1.7557,6.0893,0.2774,2.2523,2.4036,4.9227,3.0287,2.977,3.0319,4.5654,4.3789,7.8369,3.9676,1.3631,2.3503,1.3839,0.0631,3.2618,2.9232,1.7538,1.6285,4.348,5.2812,3.8156,0.3613,0.0843,0.0038,4.9189,0.1002,2.532,0.448,5.4847,0.5435]}

In 1994, as a DJ at the hip hop radio station KDAY in his hometown of Sacramento, California, he began producing hip hop records for emerging artists such as his first producing partner, rapper and founder of the group De La Soul, Donald Glover aka \"Guess Who\" and the duo MC Eiht and Slick Rick known as \"Eiht and Z-Ro\". With De La Soul, he went on to produce their second major label album, 3 Feet High and Rising in 1999, which reached number one in both the US and the UK Albums Charts.\n\nIn addition to his production work, he is currently the vocalist for the hip hop band, A Tribe Called Quest. In 2001, he released his eponymous solo album on Kanye West's G.O.O.D. Music label which peaked at #46 on the Billboard 200. The album spawned a successful single, \"I Ain't Here to Save the Fucking Children\", which reached #3 on the U.S. Hip-Hop chart, also reaching number 10 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nHis second solo album, The Great Escape Artist, was released on February 3, 2005 and features appearances from Kanye West of G.O.O.D. Music, Mos Def of Black Star, Talib Kweli of Black Star, MF Doom of doomDoom and Kool Keith. The album produced another successful single, \"We Run Things Now\" featuring his brother, Robert Glasper.\n\nHe produced and sang on \"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)\" from the Tupac Shakur documentary, The Man Called Death. He also co-produced the song \"What's Your Problem\" with Mos Def, which appears on DJ Khaled's 2007 mixtape \"No New Friends 2.0\".\n\nWhile preparing for the release of \"The Great Escape Artist\", J. Rocc, which featured contributions from B-Real and Talib Kweli, J. Rocc was cancelled before he ever saw a dime due to a disagreement between himself, Mos Def and Kanye West. G. Jones would go on solo the release and release the album in the summer of 2005 via a pay-download exclusively on the his official website.","token_len":594,"entropy":[4.992,9.3504,13.8706,8.6627,5.6274,5.5151,3.6132,5.7062,2.2698,5.7235,1.5572,13.0529,1.7234,7.2087,2.6138,0.0362,2.4159,2.9061,1.4739,0.2872,0.0037,0.5139,0.1673,0.0336,0.1017,0.0815,0.2061,0.002,0.1226,0.0872,0.4535,1.7564,0.0002,12.7387,2.1657,0.0002,8.7222,7.2369,5.5509,6.2898,0.127,0.4323,0.37,0.0003,7.2321,2.0091,0.0002,1.752,1.4173,0.0256,0.855,0.0009,0.1152,0.4052,0.0002,3.5741,10.4034,7.2295,0.5175,0.0003,1.9245,4.4363,0.4439,0.2137,0.0002,11.734,6.038,6.3129,0.2386,6.2757,0.1922,4.2895,2.9647,4.5547,3.0726,4.4155,1.0772,0.0003,7.0591,3.2218,4.1993,1.2288,3.3742,0.2155,0.2224,0.1309,0.2011,0.0057,2.7109,0.7326,2.0095,1.4816,0.6237,0.1155,0.5712,4.01,1.88,5.0431,3.1698,4.7439,3.1046,6.9905,3.8836,5.5884,0.6388,1.0881,2.6307,0.307,4.7354,3.4348,2.3572,5.7621,3.383,5.5161,7.244,0.7843,0.0005,5.2698,0.7223,0.1243,0.0023,3.5756,2.1764,1.3532,6.3218,0.6733,1.8472,1.397,2.4129,0.0111,1.0103,3.7298,0.8767,3.6167,4.1008,0.7753,5.1513,0.8621,3.8323,1.8627,2.028,4.3919,0.2202,5.08,0.1851,3.3036,8.29,3.4369,5.4732,1.102,0.1711,5.5444,0.1048,0.4633,0.1618,0.7552,3.1567,3.1866,3.5787,0.0798,4.3155,2.3202,8.6946,1.147,1.3068,0.0029,5.6206,4.9546,8.6745,3.1868,0.7826,5.0977,3.8857,6.4002,0.4091,1.4464,4.4009,6.4779,2.243,0.1039,1.6115,8.5108,2.1083,6.4668,3.3306,6.0823,3.8514,1.549,3.0243,1.8269,2.8291,5.2105,4.8912,6.064,7.3042,0.52,3.4135,8.4252,1.0111,1.8392,8.5236,0.317,1.5381,4.5231,2.0785,0.0026,2.0535,6.4177,4.9286,2.4383,1.6274,5.2157,4.8645,0.0135,0.0039,1.0677,1.2737,4.743,0.3022,0.0357,2.3311,4.7993,3.2258,4.8836,0.8198,1.2235,0.5818,6.9805,4.6112,0.4273,2.4358,11.4548,3.9078,4.561,1.1987,2.9244,4.699,0.8097,0.726,1.6288,5.2293,0.4038,1.3879,0.1838,2.1076,0.1131,7.4552,0.4334,7.3125,0.0735,0.9174,2.0256,0.0003,1.7034,4.1309,0.0777,1.4957,4.5394,1.6928,1.1317,1.5822,2.3652,3.417,2.1247,5.5312,0.1311,0.8986,1.1908,3.7673,0.0281,3.0972,3.0366,5.5323,1.4555,0.0002,0.0037,1.186,2.2089,3.4361,0.1999,0.587,1.9309,0.7069,7.3988,0.0019,3.0473,0.2436,4.8102,7.9803,0.1972,0.1143,7.1341,1.5576,1.4731,0.0146,0.0916,0.1158,0.2008,0.5967,3.303,0.6605,4.1878,3.4482,0.0439,3.4766,6.0895,0.2854,0.1401,1.5137,0.7896,1.0373,3.2185,0.9214,4.6212,1.5541,3.6885,3.4353,1.2132,0.9221,2.653,1.4206,0.0076,1.0092,1.2939,0.2446,0.5988,4.7727,1.9289,0.2954,0.9552,0.3817,3.8485,0.5972,3.4358,0.1183,0.1246,4.6693,0.0021,0.2305,0.0494,6.1561,2.6378,0.0067,1.789,2.6129,6.0473,2.4762,1.4116,5.8796,1.9611,0.4191,0.6744,7.5311,0.0106,0.372,0.6075,1.5509,0.0002,3.3926,4.0523,1.3212,0.1392,0.3432,3.1573,5.6698,3.8632,8.6948,0.5727,0.951,0.2058,1.1627,3.277,3.6721,0.809,2.0403,1.9614,5.0008,4.4243,1.4445,3.3105,0.0421,7.0731,3.2013,0.2262,0.0025,0.0012,0.0003,0.0041,0.002,0.4063,1.0502,0.4891,8.0481,0.0034,1.8707,4.6437,3.4213,0.9131,8.1312,0.095,0.0023,0.0,0.9005,2.2703,1.1929,0.618,7.8472,0.9814,0.7119,11.3335,12.0318,1.5463,1.3759,5.0285,3.3374,2.4894,2.4046,1.5062,0.3407,6.6805,5.4686,1.9586,0.4144,0.1527,0.535,4.8419,6.9804,7.5596,5.9123,2.0417,3.4697,4.7943,3.583,1.5688,7.2892,8.4255,0.0158,1.3749,1.3218,0.0002,2.8092,5.4651,2.3755,5.245,3.2184,3.1807,5.3507,4.9289,2.3293,2.948,5.5422,7.6871,1.8211,4.7762,0.1326,10.0531,1.2606,0.9424,3.4095,1.4046,8.3829,0.0557,0.2761,0.0016,5.1194,1.7329,3.1477,4.6271,4.9948,7.3738,1.5421,1.8989,0.7361,3.4238,0.0126,0.4907,1.1454,2.8546,0.8556,5.2323,1.8925,2.6891,4.9502,1.5539,0.7296,6.9782,0.0115,2.2115,2.7849,7.2657,0.6752,6.3368,2.7743,0.0002,0.0699,4.7526,5.7386,0.0852,2.2262,4.6073,6.2956,3.827,8.5947,1.6551,0.0541,0.8629,0.8834,0.0002,5.5855,7.6067,0.9676,1.5941,1.2384,0.0101,3.5665,2.5422,1.4337,0.101,0.1523,0.6137,3.8381,5.0897,9.5208,6.4272,4.0079,5.8643,2.621,5.7686,0.221,5.0325,1.9747,0.9619,2.0536,7.7256,0.0027,0.0133,0.0004,0.3026,4.86,0.1191,1.089,0.0284,2.4032,9.6418,5.8467,2.4896,5.1557,4.6381,2.9662,6.1738,7.1316,0.0135,1.8962,6.4596,2.7246,3.2328,3.307,3.5544,0.0127,0.3461,4.8624,0.1371,0.7299,7.5063,0.0601,7.405,5.3065,3.7314,0.0474,10.5734,6.1954,5.5993,3.3267,3.9177,2.2042,0.8833,2.1484,2.9775,3.0053,0.0517,2.3368,5.9708,3.7958,7.5272,0.7113,13.252,9.521,2.0098,2.4592,7.8878,3.4328,1.2095,0.8807]}
{"id":1654,"ended":true,"length":526,"text":"My first three tests of writing prompts... not bad for a newbie.\n\nIt\u2019s been kind of quiet the last month here, mainly because I have two jobs, one in-home, the other in an office. It really gets in the way of writing sometimes. We had so much rain we lost the well to overflowing for a while, and that was a real hardship this spring.\n\nIt\u2019s good to finally have things back to \u201cnormal\u201d around here again. I got a new job in an office, but I still have that good ol\u2019 in-home job where I get to write alllllll the time. And I have a new baby at home to keep me busy too. He\u2019s a real ham! Loves to laugh and smile\u2013and is always making that adorable baby sound that cracks both mommy and daddy up all day.\n\nAnyway I wanted to try to do a little writing this morning. I guess I should have started today\u2019s writing prompt, but I\u2019ll get to the other one in a moment.\n\nAnyway, this is a short writing prompt for you to use in your writing practice. I\u2019ve used it before and it\u2019s lots of fun to write. I know I said this one would be short but I still had a lot of fun writing it for you. I hope you do too.\n\nHow often on your commute do you fantasize about getting a new car?\n\nHow about buying a new house? Vacationing in a nice hotel? A nice vacation where you go on horseback riding for a day? Or a day on a beach to relax on? Or a new camera to take great photos?\n\nNow write like you are that kid who gets to play all of those video games and watch all of those movies. You\u2019ve been allowed to do all of that stuff all of your life and now you\u2019re in the same position as the kid on the playground who gets to play all of his favorite video games and watch all of his favorite movies.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do. But it\u2019s not going to be at home.\n\nWrite that fantasy! Write the part where you are an adult now and you get to do all of those things. Have a good trip down memory lane. Feel nostalgic.\n\nAnd keep your day job.

{"id":750,"ended":true,"length":546,"text":"You're walking down the street and bump shoulders with someone. It's you. You have no idea who they are.\n\nIn most cases, we don 't know the exact details. It could simply be a complete stranger who simply walked into your path.\n\nYou've probably done this at times in your life. It could be a friend, a relative or even an employee at a store who suddenly appears out of nowhere.\n\nWhat happens next?...\n\nYou are likely to turn around and give them a glare, perhaps making eye contact as you pass them. You probably said a few grudging words to that person as you grudgingly moved on.\n\nOn the street, this may be a harmless encounter.\n\nBut what happens when you're face to face with the person you bumped into?\n\nIs it possible that you will get more angry and possibly even strike them or even threaten them if they bump into you again?\n\nIs it possible that you will lose your calm with this person and even let them know that they have no business bumping into you at all?\n\nMost of the human race have been exposed to this exact situation where this happened. They were faced with someone walking towards them who simply bumped into them.\n\nThey were shocked and it didn 't take long for them to either yell at the person and even hit them.\n\nThe reason why this almost always happens is because many of the human race would prefer to keep to themselves.\n\nIn that regard, we get into a defensive crouch where we need to look out for our own safety and the safety of others.\n\nThe more someone comes into our personal space, the more we feel this need to protect our space to ourselves.\n\nThis is a sign of the human race getting more and more afraid each day.\n\nThe less we let people come into our personal space, it seems to us that this is just how the human race is progressing to.\n\nIt is as if the human race no longer trust people. They no longer like people who may bump into them during their daily life.\n\nWhen this happens, you may feel so embarrassed that you let someone know that you're not pleased that they came into your space without your permission.\n\nYou didn't have to say a word. Even a nod of the head will show the other person that they need to back away from you for their own good.\n\nWhen it comes to personal space, the more people have come to depend on themselves and the less someone comes into the space they occupy.\n\nIf something like this happens to you, please don't lose your temper. Just look back with a cold stare and let them know you are not happy to have them bump into you.\n\nSometimes they don't realize that what they did was wrong and they need to think about it and correct it next time.","token_len":595,"entropy":[5.2846,7.1349,1.9326,0.4444,0.699,1.7653,9.7509,10.9968,0.3161,3.3297,1.6616,2.293,0.3336,7.14,1.7027,1.7368,3.8005,2.8469,1.0089,2.0075,2.5046,0.0821,0.6428,2.5794,0.0012,4.7088,5.4148,0.9529,0.3044,3.7448,2.3512,12.1553,1.307,1.5601,3.219,4.6335,4.3475,1.8578,2.7873,4.0352,6.4749,0.1199,1.977,8.0683,1.1333,2.3227,6.2742,2.7544,2.093,0.8758,8.2218,0.9769,1.5144,0.0002,3.7966,3.3675,2.4716,4.8055,1.8619,4.6808,6.2067,3.0729,0.3771,0.1219,0.9682,2.3857,1.9766,0.5673,1.7043,2.899,1.6697,1.0457,2.7769,1.7491,1.4477,2.5089,3.4573,2.7379,0.723,3.0327,3.399,4.9597,3.8521,3.2176,0.0335,0.0351,0.9126,0.7794,0.0001,4.143,3.389,1.7353,0.9227,11.116,0.5121,0.0001,2.557,4.051,4.734,0.7011,5.8075,1.7921,0.4266,5.8208,2.6895,0.7463,6.6778,2.0948,4.908,5.2218,5.0965,0.0074,4.4877,0.8748,3.0271,1.7318,0.4641,3.1361,4.0782,6.9775,3.8767,0.8974,7.449,5.9057,1.3811,2.3883,5.5711,0.711,3.7553,0.8419,10.5766,2.7855,0.0084,4.5163,2.971,0.5282,0.5357,0.0002,6.2612,0.3097,5.2931,0.4278,4.0392,2.6982,1.3487,1.9823,5.5107,4.102,1.2147,1.7527,0.0002,1.8501,3.2699,1.6895,1.7618,0.6208,2.6595,6.95,0.4344,0.0052,0.1269,2.9936,1.1466,1.1243,4.6553,0.6738,0.4999,0.3513,0.0002,5.3321,1.1085,3.2628,1.44,1.6681,4.826,3.3428,4.5771,4.0008,1.8189,5.625,1.9499,7.9355,1.2668,4.1534,3.5263,3.9063,0.9105,4.5735,0.9399,6.2301,0.3139,0.0434,3.1794,0.1259,0.135,0.0002,3.9258,0.3627,0.3868,0.2602,0.9319,0.7128,4.6364,1.2993,5.8383,6.0592,3.235,1.0899,1.7997,4.4055,5.9696,0.2373,1.5534,0.7349,2.1799,2.381,1.7201,2.1707,3.0631,0.0175,0.5484,0.0596,4.0397,0.2334,0.149,0.0436,0.0002,5.843,2.3505,0.5626,9.0096,2.1796,4.3951,2.3727,4.3811,0.0705,1.6315,5.6934,1.2624,5.4443,4.3672,3.9941,1.2916,4.6806,3.4331,6.4014,0.0314,6.2422,4.467,4.2848,0.2116,3.8856,3.9785,4.3382,0.1796,0.1455,0.7883,0.3469,0.0001,3.3062,2.5386,4.1666,1.1418,5.5546,4.0974,4.3813,0.0512,3.0321,0.6074,0.991,0.4993,0.0198,7.3378,6.2331,2.1075,1.5051,0.8505,4.7315,6.0405,4.5066,0.622,1.2806,0.2246,0.0001,2.8255,4.5115,1.6652,1.3804,8.0414,1.6101,0.2925,0.2702,0.548,5.4451,1.3694,1.6131,3.1146,0.9866,5.7195,5.0488,0.6737,3.6933,4.7493,0.3669,1.4258,0.5434,0.0001,3.6237,5.4072,4.1448,0.1171,2.7291,5.4788,5.0413,1.5057,7.166,4.4398,0.0222,3.1789,0.2899,6.0694,0.1164,5.3939,2.5559,0.2933,2.323,1.3161,0.1577,1.8232,4.0091,0.3864,0.0137,0.6404,0.2136,0.14,0.0001,3.2064,3.0539,5.7445,4.4506,1.9022,0.502,5.4248,0.5595,0.6881,0.0829,0.4017,1.6299,2.7831,4.7353,4.543,0.2809,1.1022,2.6328,5.2262,5.8886,3.966,0.438,0.1178,0.0001,2.1007,1.0544,2.5002,6.034,0.8692,2.752,3.1956,1.587,5.7,2.8736,1.7654,0.0019,4.1701,6.7728,0.6099,0.4964,0.2712,0.0001,2.9097,3.8054,1.0328,4.2565,2.7912,4.3914,0.2582,0.0409,1.1249,0.0749,0.4357,5.9848,4.3876,1.9672,1.978,1.5096,3.2218,1.1771,3.6449,4.7948,2.4785,1.3647,0.0649,0.9536,6.1114,5.3104,5.9682,0.0715,0.0001,2.6882,1.6804,4.9395,0.2758,1.8501,1.35,0.0393,6.6355,0.0012,6.3041,3.5901,2.0885,2.7128,2.423,0.0006,4.8803,2.6008,2.1624,4.9062,6.0095,0.2774,0.1512,6.833,2.0047,2.2589,2.4831,0.3014,0.1443,0.0001,3.7537,2.7214,0.2885,0.326,3.7632,1.7907,1.8814,5.5116,4.3292,1.5487,0.2185,5.1337,2.0765,3.5999,0.5296,0.4674,2.9516,1.8978,7.178,3.1756,0.8518,4.8873,0.5559,0.1397,1.8171,5.5262,1.2665,0.6679,0.2373,0.063,0.0001,2.2056,7.7291,0.1434,3.0797,0.8837,4.1857,2.1149,0.5276,1.9317,5.2564,4.111,7.6582,1.3646,3.3579,0.0773,2.878,5.223,3.2651,4.4435,0.4474,0.6138,2.9609,4.9216,0.2955,5.7534,2.7518,0.9555,0.5178,5.1695,3.6561,1.2583,3.5152,0.1235,0.0704,0.0002,3.3144,2.9636,1.1832,0.0629,4.6821,0.293,0.1827,2.3213,2.1509,1.575,4.3493,1.5642,2.6749,10.3211,0.1285,6.4254,2.1673,1.5394,1.1488,6.8743,3.3662,0.6404,3.4281,1.3816,4.2842,6.8009,0.4244,0.056,0.0001,3.165,5.6907,2.6319,0.1888,0.2549,1.2875,0.15,0.3824,3.3522,2.5424,0.1051,5.7549,0.8468,2.6805,0.8205,3.659,4.7503,4.7111,5.3406,1.2444,6.7207,1.8523,0.84,2.2845,1.8361,0.0673,2.6645,2.057,1.358,1.2936,4.3032,2.3298,1.6435,2.735,0.3353,0.0564,0.5163,0.1519,0.0002,5.2026,3.8253,3.7058,0.2086,3.5582,1.1401,4.074,0.7162,2.8111,0.9284,0.9657,1.2548,1.4787,4.1045,0.2722,5.1805,0.8395,2.1863,2.8873,5.3068,0.5565,6.0934,0.0248,0.2505]}
{"id":3949,"ended":true,"length":551,"text":"Our hero has fallen, the final curtain has been pulled back, and what he has discovered is that \"We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\"\n\nWednesday, December 5, 2012\n\nPresident Obama has just given his farewell address. What will be written about it? Not much.\n\nBut there will be a million stories written in tribute to him.\n\nHere are five of the best:\n\n1. That old \"I can see Russia from my house\" schtick.\n\nYes, Obama is a man among boys.\n\nIf we can do that, why not that?\n\nWhat more did we ever need?\n\n2. \"This isn't a campaign. This is a job.\"\n\nThis was, of course, uttered in the midst of the 2012 Presidential campaign, as a taunt to Mitt Romney. But what is this, a government job? No.\n\nPresident Obama is still an employee. He is going home to a government paycheck, at $400,000\/year. To this date, he has not given an inch. Obama wants to keep his government positions. He will continue to serve as a member of the Board of Directors at Citigroup (C), a member of the Board of Directors at Starbucks (SBUX), and a member of the National Council of Teachers of English.\n\n3. \"I didn't have a choice, I have a mandate.\"\n\nYes, a mandate. If the President had no mandate, why did he win, against the wishes of the Republicans of the House of Representatives?\n\nThis mandate thing is a crock. It did not exist when Obama ran in 2008. It has not been proved that it exists in 2012.\n\nPresident Obama will go down in history with William Jennings Bryan as the only Presidents who won elections based on a \"mandate.\"\n\n4. \"I'm not going away.\"\n\nYes. This is a statement with which every American has become very familiar. After losing the House and the Senate, Obama will once again move on, after he is done with his last Cabinet meeting.\n\n5. \"A strong America is in your interests.\"\n\nIf he knew this, why would President Obama repeatedly promise the American people that he would work tirelessly to weaken the country?\n\nNo President since Franklin Roosevelt has worked more tirelessly to weaken the American economy than Obama. What's in America's best interests? Strong Americans.\n\nWhat's in Barack Obama's best interests? President Obama knows very well he's going home, and his goal is to make sure his legacy is not diminished by having a lame duck administration.","token_len":597,"entropy":[8.918,3.5076,5.2876,2.1592,3.3546,7.1984,6.0841,0.4042,0.356,1.7341,3.0203,1.3834,0.6376,5.3142,5.218,1.7542,6.2745,0.668,1.4126,6.9504,4.8982,4.6965,0.4715,1.4569,1.4288,1.902,1.976,0.0571,0.7541,5.4615,3.7416,0.0946,6.1803,0.597,3.4956,2.3854,1.1572,0.6299,6.9678,3.9746,1.3055,3.0664,6.4817,0.2273,0.3183,0.3021,4.8217,0.1577,0.4764,1.2312,0.2762,0.4332,3.5883,0.8546,1.3374,0.04,0.2978,0.7097,1.5125,0.5797,0.8427,0.0873,0.5021,2.5069,0.5023,0.0843,0.3085,0.138,0.0001,0.4158,4.0767,5.1202,0.013,0.9756,0.5063,1.6809,0.6141,1.7037,0.5338,1.231,0.0039,0.3302,0.0027,0.9689,0.9341,0.0015,9.776,0.3409,3.054,3.2447,0.2372,4.6974,0.5036,0.0002,2.9802,0.6161,3.9729,4.2532,4.2572,1.5461,3.221,0.1493,2.1068,5.059,3.276,2.1175,6.0068,1.7893,1.716,0.4759,6.6411,0.3792,0.5585,2.1526,0.0002,4.0694,2.9409,2.4685,0.1944,1.4131,8.8856,3.5564,4.8252,3.8233,5.7529,0.2849,2.3462,0.6691,1.4062,0.0002,3.2664,0.6016,2.8381,1.7768,1.4943,2.1657,1.6026,0.0866,0.0001,1.2832,0.2595,5.6393,7.929,4.3292,3.8654,4.2709,3.9192,9.684,4.7066,1.858,2.8038,0.8562,9.4926,0.1791,1.1812,0.7343,0.0002,5.1377,0.1879,2.7171,1.8674,1.9456,3.0803,8.6163,6.7806,1.1389,1.9766,0.0002,4.7539,3.0689,2.9711,4.6427,2.4985,0.5493,3.5014,1.1444,6.2638,2.07,0.6512,0.0002,4.6718,4.9419,4.9167,1.8031,3.6765,0.9315,0.7325,0.3074,0.0002,1.2506,0.0013,2.7307,4.5422,4.1902,0.0005,1.8558,4.6528,2.0721,0.4537,0.3639,0.7091,5.3584,0.8384,0.1033,0.0002,3.2054,3.3679,4.8971,2.3734,0.0068,0.0052,7.2489,2.1172,1.5968,4.6755,0.0016,1.0598,5.1214,3.7989,0.6433,2.0338,3.6456,2.6185,7.0526,1.008,3.8373,0.0027,0.9882,3.19,3.5961,2.7851,2.8687,2.6895,2.2619,7.7333,0.6934,0.5289,4.4488,1.8773,1.2146,0.0001,5.351,0.0628,1.5671,5.0358,3.4531,3.2163,1.7539,1.3837,1.6826,6.3538,3.7663,1.1978,3.2719,7.3111,5.9177,2.3475,4.8088,3.9496,5.0865,1.0653,0.0397,6.4685,0.4519,0.521,6.017,4.256,5.1028,0.2488,0.7247,0.6777,1.0689,4.3947,1.9585,6.6207,1.0063,5.5534,5.1888,0.6828,3.7145,1.3684,3.2088,7.2451,1.0178,1.4748,3.6834,2.2085,0.2747,3.8383,1.5607,1.8851,3.663,0.0282,0.8655,3.4156,0.055,1.7081,3.7759,3.7302,0.2274,3.6893,2.9699,3.1686,2.2681,6.2612,0.0079,0.2651,1.0411,0.0309,1.7495,0.4694,6.5162,0.1119,0.6507,0.3191,0.212,0.8391,1.4189,0.2189,0.0097,0.1404,6.5418,2.6641,0.3493,4.1847,1.5288,2.8796,1.8202,0.782,0.0002,1.0214,0.0013,0.6084,1.9045,5.1694,0.0004,3.16,1.4114,2.3668,2.8973,2.1961,3.0297,1.0117,4.9705,0.7291,0.0042,0.0002,3.0166,0.2185,5.3303,0.2494,0.51,5.2457,3.016,3.0103,2.6884,4.9181,2.3618,0.3541,2.4387,2.2809,0.1731,6.8009,3.835,6.8584,2.0004,1.5935,0.1081,1.2943,5.2785,4.5733,1.231,1.4499,0.9152,0.0046,0.6787,0.6093,0.0002,4.2575,7.8803,9.6205,0.9682,2.3017,7.2788,0.0419,1.4902,2.3156,6.6763,0.1842,3.1194,2.4848,1.5822,3.2674,3.8782,0.9582,0.4091,1.442,2.6518,1.7165,2.194,8.9089,3.7631,1.2711,1.3317,3.6487,2.2889,0.2548,1.0963,0.0002,5.1806,0.0387,2.9043,4.6295,3.7498,0.772,0.018,4.751,11.2473,1.4805,0.0016,1.4857,0.6791,3.4234,8.0752,1.4451,4.6605,4.9719,4.9751,0.1579,2.4552,4.3717,2.7058,0.0948,0.5584,1.0277,0.0002,0.4399,0.0012,0.3501,1.5912,2.0801,1.3421,1.8385,5.7457,1.2732,0.0233,0.0002,1.3838,1.8668,3.243,0.7705,1.6419,4.5745,6.018,3.1168,4.8314,1.5883,2.6335,5.7222,4.6746,0.177,0.193,6.1751,4.7976,1.0082,4.8586,2.1412,1.791,0.1876,0.9746,1.0289,3.6337,5.326,0.0343,5.1662,1.5002,3.3549,5.2669,3.6103,3.2211,3.0198,1.621,1.5277,4.7031,7.8639,4.1514,0.778,0.9076,0.0002,0.5226,0.0008,0.1829,4.9426,5.3014,3.2985,1.158,5.0736,5.046,5.5104,0.7377,0.01,0.0002,4.6663,3.5963,6.5044,2.6767,0.7873,2.9709,1.6519,5.6323,0.0828,9.4376,3.2221,3.7201,1.6212,0.0329,0.7713,0.4494,0.5961,4.3473,3.9842,0.3476,7.4643,0.988,4.3756,1.303,0.4402,0.0002,4.7036,4.8971,3.2576,2.4476,0.6578,0.3487,4.9763,2.7438,2.7937,0.5426,0.7253,0.3901,2.6012,1.3803,0.7211,1.5959,1.2185,5.0715,3.1637,5.1385,4.2144,1.4068,3.983,1.1725,2.1814,7.2068,6.303,0.5476,1.0295,0.0002,4.2418,1.58,0.7387,7.3897,0.0435,0.0453,0.1402,0.0774,0.4474,6.0693,0.7691,4.8581,4.8482,0.2426,4.2626,3.8151,1.9262,5.3742,2.6974,1.6829,3.2565,5.1521,0.3515,0.4951,2.7089,1.1504,2.7279,3.5056,0.9829,2.7553,4.8752,1.2512,5.8962,1.9112,5.1391,0.2633,4.2246,0.5615]}

{"id":4404,"ended":true,"length":556,"text":"Three people are having a conversation in which no one is 100 % sure of the topic, but each is determined to figure it out through the context.\n\nThe conversation is interrupted by a doorbell, and a middle aged man comes to the front door, ringing it, while continuing the conversation. Everyone stops talking for a while, but when their host invites the visitor in, they continue talking.\n\nOne of the three goes outside to see the visitor; the other two stay inside, and the two are still talking.\n\nThe one outside is a lawyer and the other two are his partners in law firm.\n\nThe lawyer who went outside is an expert in the law of real estate.\n\nThe middle aged man was a real estate developer.\n\nThe doorbell rings again ; one partner has gone outside to talk to the visiting investor.\n\nInside the room, the two who didn\u2019t go out see an accountant is looking at his cell phone in the kitchen.\n\nThe accountant sees all three talking in the other room and realizes he has missed a call with a potential client who wanted to know about some real estate deals he had heard about but didn\u2019t want to invest in.\n\nSo he leaves the kitchen where he is working, goes to the entrance and rings the doorbell. The guests are all talking when he arrives and he just looks at the door for a second without saying anything.\n\nHe then goes to the kitchen again and starts working again, without saying anything. Later, he goes out to talk to the investment company on the phone and asks the potential client who rang the doorbell.\n\nThe potential clients answers that it was his wife.\n\nThe accountant goes into the other conversation while the two left talk for a while in the hall of the building.\n\nWhen the guests are all talking again in the room, the accountant comes back, looks at the two who came out and is asking what they see.\n\nOne of them says that it is just her and her husband. Another says that is their best client and he is showing his daughter in the building.\n\nThe conversation continues\n\nA little later, the guests come back into the room and tell the accountant that he has missed his call from the investment company, which was his biggest potential investment of the year.\n\nThe accountant tells all three that they should be worried because his friend and partner got there a short time later and was furious after seeing him talking with his wife.\n\nLater that day, the accountant and his partner meet with the client of the real estate firm, who tells them how
