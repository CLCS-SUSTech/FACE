The proposed amendment says that if the government chooses to override the divorce deal, it must make the agreement public, allow parliamentary and judicial scrutiny and give lawmakers time to try to derail such a move.","token_len":134,"entropy":[6.9938,5.0627,0.0006,10.5582,7.4511,3.5965,6.3321,2.6422,2.8891,1.8088,3.7394,8.1545,6.1493,4.0776,5.8604,0.2941,4.276,4.3757,7.7562,2.0548,9.2332,1.7481,2.9872,5.8647,2.7743,10.0135,6.9235,0.1812,0.0378,1.109,0.0736,0.1627,5.4546,1.1677,5.5978,6.7674,0.8196,1.1489,3.0321,0.0078,0.1761,9.2828,5.6297,5.6912,2.558,3.1665,1.0085,2.3705,0.0596,8.4375,0.2125,5.4102,1.6607,3.6101,2.3792,5.3301,1.0794,1.82,2.9133,1.0001,0.6935,2.5529,2.6918,0.0544,0.1305,6.4372,0.2741,1.9084,6.9743,0.1357,3.081,0.8208,0.6786,4.8385,3.8654,6.3833,2.4622,0.8021,6.0803,0.1513,3.3591,1.3343,4.0453,0.5996,0.0922,7.9807,1.4395,2.9662,3.8842,2.4029,3.9854,0.9332,0.878,0.9075,1.2794,5.3075,1.0439,5.5934,1.0954,2.2528,0.9662,1.5541,4.4776,0.269,4.6494,0.3138,2.5865,0.7607,0.5183,1.0947,1.0044,3.8386,2.4069,4.035,3.9094,2.5035,7.0009,5.3776,5.1021,3.0563,1.4309,1.5235,3.683,6.18,2.0806,0.0517,6.1499,0.4422,6.4004,6.614,0.4937,1.2379,0.2601]}

Some 30% of all movie theaters will play only Saudi-made movies.","token_len":143,"entropy":[7.8686,9.9328,1.9277,6.8477,0.1531,0.4234,1.7099,0.0954,0.7669,0.1503,9.3696,0.1757,4.4548,2.9396,1.3164,5.3846,6.0882,2.7474,6.1152,3.3717,3.3082,9.1652,0.1902,5.8206,5.807,11.5881,1.2766,8.2772,10.1721,1.5828,8.2038,1.045,1.8631,0.8896,1.9346,0.0083,0.2453,3.739,6.3233,7.6987,2.7712,0.4438,1.5995,3.41,3.4479,1.2659,7.0287,5.1488,3.9969,1.5803,1.6793,2.6197,2.887,6.6934,0.0198,4.1063,3.1416,2.7031,3.4148,5.8291,3.8265,8.4445,0.0952,0.5189,4.9469,0.0016,0.0024,2.4691,2.9015,8.2286,1.1117,0.7036,19.2158,5.1179,2.7183,0.0047,2.1264,1.2825,2.1611,10.5755,8.2479,0.02,1.9325,6.7424,5.4456,1.2269,2.6099,1.7556,4.493,2.1651,1.3595,2.019,0.6486,2.1318,7.467,0.8683,0.3566,0.1484,0.6724,1.7776,7.9973,1.7691,0.1822,4.4917,3.2737,2.8204,3.4011,0.0023,0.3416,1.0779,7.5601,8.8244,2.2863,2.8901,1.1604,4.2403,2.3059,3.2172,1.8074,0.1221,1.8929,1.8246,2.6709,0.0019,1.3514,1.5347,0.1927,5.2209,7.2958,3.3889,0.0586,2.484,2.6768,3.1496,1.654,6.7902,3.1745,5.9892,1.524,1.8223,2.1202,1.2159]}

Cornyn said tax-cut legislation could also help lift the U.S. stock market, which has fallen 13.5 percent since the beginning of November.\n\n(Reporting by Amanda Becker in Washington and Caroline Valetkevitch in New York; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Peter Cooney)","token_len":179,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.1615,4.7934,2.9858,2.4746,0.0292,8.7732,0.331,7.3925,5.7133,3.7304,6.4654,0.0013,3.9682,3.4055,4.3748,1.7885,1.8907,1.0658,0.3651,0.9019,1.781,0.0167,2.5286,4.7347,3.6627,2.2046,1.6577,0.0001,1.97,1.5803,1.8818,0.3067,3.7764,1.376,2.8371,7.3243,0.7917,1.0529,2.7665,2.8675,1.3052,5.5553,0.0012,3.8338,0.7322,0.383,0.0002,6.0409,1.7109,1.4617,1.3134,1.491,6.6102,5.0027,0.2508,0.001,0.4445,1.9799,14.1858,9.1936,2.4418,7.2223,3.092,1.7232,1.4619,4.4892,9.8664,0.7969,0.0002,4.6245,3.0273,1.1387,2.3182,0.9509,3.1971,0.0002,0.0019,0.0024,0.8633,4.465,0.5628,3.8331,0.0734,0.9616,0.8689,0.4949,5.0768,3.9071,0.0032,3.0052,0.148,3.4803,0.9695,1.1845,0.7827,2.1093,1.2043,3.0126,1.6456,3.333,2.5972,0.9228,2.3628,1.8675,2.0081,3.1938,0.0079,4.7828,2.9374,0.1794,1.9042,3.9849,0.0028,0.8548,8.3759,4.3285,1.8281,1.8984,2.2613,3.3015,5.8427,6.3603,1.0635,3.6664,0.0003,0.0033,0.003,3.1877,0.0859,1.6117,1.5691,1.2637,2.1292,5.3914,2.5297,1.3871,0.3109,1.4032,1.2837,2.9972,0.0038,3.8691,0.3292,0.1919,0.0003,5.4517,0.8441,0.0851,6.0691,1.8444,1.2224,0.7037,3.3122,6.9561,9.5568,5.4726,9.5064,5.7285,1.2018,0.0969,2.9137,0.0268,0.0522,0.209,0.0017,4.9215,1.6685,0.0588,0.0913,1.0194,3.57,0.0129,0.0007,0.0298]}

Long said as much as 500 to 600 people may be dead from the storm, and that at least 30,000 are either stranded or unaccounted for due to the storm.","token_len":193,"entropy":[3.8374,4.2023,1.485,4.8635,0.2157,5.6145,0.7071,4.8737,0.0392,0.5465,1.6373,7.6504,7.3183,3.3789,2.3127,2.6752,1.8424,1.5009,6.2697,3.5281,14.3035,4.8895,0.622,1.4303,0.4093,6.5984,1.8132,2.0968,2.6542,0.144,8.596,2.1024,2.9605,16.2164,9.6637,7.6051,0.0537,0.0,2.1445,0.6653,5.4938,1.9598,3.0391,0.2546,1.9155,6.5828,0.4628,2.4157,0.3431,0.0737,6.2234,3.802,2.4518,4.5031,0.6183,1.7677,3.4574,8.0477,1.4625,1.9468,0.9359,1.2024,4.3718,5.3601,0.1307,4.8675,6.9891,0.0105,0.1818,1.7636,1.1474,1.7643,2.9782,5.6884,0.5038,0.6907,4.8397,5.0643,4.1677,0.5164,0.0769,3.8868,2.7269,5.3455,6.1158,0.3129,0.9004,0.0003,2.9818,4.1699,1.2791,3.4365,0.1769,2.0938,7.4344,0.0271,0.0701,1.3448,2.5118,0.5878,4.6669,0.1781,0.0245,0.2765,4.2863,6.2463,0.4241,3.3848,3.7783,1.2034,1.9774,6.6628,1.7808,1.9322,2.1876,1.4796,0.8589,0.7564,3.0751,3.6727,4.6868,3.4358,3.7888,2.3092,1.9898,0.5552,0.0002,5.1853,7.1589,3.2274,0.0557,0.9129,0.8928,0.5803,2.9511,4.0245,4.4931,5.2686,7.3625,0.1585,5.6844,0.0636,6.2511,1.5024,3.5265,3.6152,4.7045,0.0064,3.3227,3.3939,5.3962,2.2688,6.2573,2.5233,0.7059,0.8445,0.9815,4.8299,1.0645,6.1429,2.8426,0.7896,6.1096,3.9638,1.296,1.089,3.5515,1.4301,4.3323,3.848,1.0009,0.9853,1.2411,1.4966,1.9003,4.736,0.3825,3.7533,0.7797,0.0018,4.0951,6.6251,4.549,0.5462,6.3326,0.0006,0.0212,4.2853,0.0079,2.3041,1.9223,1.0446]}

It was Mueller \u2019 s first known contact with Kushner since he was appointed in May to lead the wide-ranging investigation into possible collusion between Trump \u2019 s 2016 election campaign and Russia.\n\nIn a statement to Reuters, Trump, said: \u201cThis is more fake news.\u201d The development could be a significant development in one of the biggest and most high-profile investigations into any U.S. president in recent memory. Reuters had reported in November that Mueller was examining Trump\u2019s decision to fire FBI director James Comey. The move raised questions over whether Trump was acting to obstruct justice by undermining the FBI \u2019 s Russia investigation.","token_len":199,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,12.1247,7.6839,8.0232,5.9363,0.8217,0.0002,0.0018,0.0006,1.8967,0.0326,0.0005,0.5121,4.2379,0.2172,8.3972,0.0253,0.0138,0.0145,3.993,0.1292,5.576,4.104,3.9149,0.2282,0.8431,4.3007,0.4587,0.0005,4.8248,2.3024,0.8415,2.4575,4.483,0.2601,2.0998,1.9923,2.6653,0.4327,1.3393,0.152,0.0005,0.0109,0.3395,0.0376,3.6096,3.1299,0.2051,0.8949,6.7149,0.0021,0.1615,4.2469,1.7465,3.2535,0.0016,3.5304,0.8801,5.2754,0.8164,0.4601,4.1248,1.0937,5.0089,4.786,0.0026,0.2135,1.5083,5.9036,1.7972,0.0236,1.847,2.1869,2.0177,1.2105,1.7758,3.2123,2.0912,3.3252,1.0511,0.1484,8.2425,0.061,0.0279,1.387,0.2938,2.0338,0.6014,0.1765,1.5239,14.5791,0.034,0.0281,6.6066,2.8367,0.1054,0.1069,0.2937,0.2973,1.4105,0.0002,3.0457,1.3319,1.0568,2.3442,4.2108,0.4113,2.5035,4.9857,6.7297,2.3265,5.1649,6.1812,8.1252,0.9908,6.5659,10.6792,0.0278,2.6602,6.5807,9.0787,4.0761,10.0512,5.9514,1.887,1.3584,6.1048,2.7433,1.8866,6.9289,0.0698,0.2883,2.5097,3.6159,0.2887,7.1225,0.1401,0.1143,1.6503,1.5771,3.7369,2.6362,0.0006,0.0009,0.0055,0.7418,1.0894,1.9621,0.5748,0.3035,9.1282,4.2315,1.6368,2.6188,3.3097,0.2255,2.0502,1.3487,2.8553,3.3456,8.414,0.0457,4.4584,4.7017,0.5157,1.2032,0.4134,2.674,0.021,0.0554,1.454,2.4109,3.6798,2.9686,0.6705,2.3392,0.5329,1.0258,1.5406,2.6486,3.1697,2.9075,0.0953,2.6632,6.5705,0.9373,1.9405,7.6535,0.0592,0.0623,4.8744,0.5864,0.5626]}
