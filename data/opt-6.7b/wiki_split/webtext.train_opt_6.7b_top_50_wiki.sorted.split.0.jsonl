This gas, in turn, is used to remove the excess heat produced by the fission reactions.","token_len":129,"entropy":[7.1847,3.0829,0.9146,3.3438,3.5,1.352,2.1561,6.8436,8.189,1.6733,6.0829,1.0343,1.7404,8.9943,0.2797,0.7052,6.4484,3.7749,12.1454,10.9163,9.8118,4.053,3.3987,3.658,3.9434,2.5156,1.9123,3.5652,4.9851,0.0568,3.5034,4.8909,7.2449,0.0035,0.0002,8.0275,0.455,5.491,2.2076,1.2911,0.9942,2.4423,0.4399,1.4071,5.0681,5.4941,2.9585,0.4579,3.7478,3.1919,3.5191,2.3559,2.6367,6.3548,1.1145,1.3032,0.451,1.3028,6.9378,0.2729,6.2874,0.042,3.8692,2.4444,3.1144,0.9235,5.672,0.5078,0.2359,2.138,0.1001,3.2461,3.8263,0.1408,2.5657,0.0753,4.975,0.1389,2.0925,3.3728,0.6455,0.2642,2.3593,8.5457,1.1718,0.3524,1.3184,0.0815,2.0588,2.2092,8.1678,0.7824,5.5946,0.1297,5.9393,0.336,0.8369,3.6641,4.7135,0.5024,0.5718,4.8422,0.7619,0.0125,2.9732,1.2671,5.873,0.8693,2.3296,4.0596,3.2446,2.8602,0.0813,0.019,2.4981,3.0074,0.9236,5.4902,1.1144,3.5522,3.5366,3.1705,0.2131,0.4043,1.804,0.018,2.1347,0.9538]}

American-style plum cake may also be served, plain, or with a filling of lemon-lime mousse or fruit.\n\nThe cake is one of Britain's traditional treats for the summer months.","token_len":137,"entropy":[8.0377,9.3143,1.7863,9.1822,6.9873,5.0823,4.5359,3.7349,1.2133,4.6246,3.3748,1.1577,2.8722,16.8905,9.0763,0.3589,3.7807,8.5464,8.7236,4.6001,2.0419,0.0386,6.0793,1.5914,1.6068,1.3801,5.1866,2.6504,5.3209,0.1961,1.6361,1.957,0.6807,2.7246,1.7095,1.4765,0.1082,0.2929,1.6005,5.3067,5.379,2.0692,2.249,1.0004,3.2956,5.8273,0.1548,7.8392,0.6334,7.9033,3.8858,4.0753,7.0878,4.0564,0.4846,5.2163,3.7602,2.9411,0.9062,4.07,4.9093,3.1967,4.1539,6.5836,4.2185,2.6244,2.1777,4.6364,1.0691,2.2513,5.7681,0.5053,2.0203,1.8028,0.0515,4.8513,4.3562,5.4864,0.6367,2.0478,2.7668,3.4583,12.2153,0.2214,2.7875,3.5505,2.0207,0.8166,3.2166,3.8189,0.1639,5.2428,0.0588,0.0002,2.7091,4.7442,1.594,0.8445,2.5153,0.5685,3.5972,1.3983,0.4037,2.989,5.3725,8.1627,1.5144,1.6064,1.4555,1.6669,5.6097,1.0431,4.6068,3.3778,0.8081,5.6421,1.6285,1.6931,5.2923,1.4158,1.6012,0.0013,2.2346,4.6141,1.2027,5.4474,0.0517,7.4053,0.0292,3.5268,5.4798,3.2893,2.1335,3.639,2.5325,0.7769]}

But the actor declined to play the character offered to him and suggested the producer to rope in a new actor. Jeethu later approached Rajinikanth as the lead, but the former also refused to play the character and asked him to choose another actor.","token_len":140,"entropy":[9.8095,6.9781,7.8897,6.8507,13.1403,8.8352,5.9268,8.1162,10.0303,6.7181,11.7386,9.6815,6.5074,3.3595,5.6254,2.1264,4.8562,3.2685,0.6541,2.3962,1.8451,3.4835,0.0324,5.6404,3.3148,6.0402,3.7834,0.0057,0.0048,0.5539,6.516,1.2349,0.9918,7.4654,4.765,5.3498,3.4809,0.6222,5.7476,0.0011,1.9415,5.037,0.3378,6.7057,5.3534,0.2426,6.1206,3.7386,4.3804,5.7814,2.0621,0.9181,2.4846,7.3558,2.1653,0.6341,2.6711,0.8315,1.4652,0.8769,5.3887,2.2111,0.0013,0.0011,2.9917,1.8873,0.0035,0.0005,4.5747,1.2023,6.4738,1.818,3.3099,6.7873,6.2783,0.2987,1.0409,0.0011,0.0009,0.4233,5.8645,1.3358,3.7175,1.9001,0.693,4.212,0.5833,3.8935,2.7976,2.2529,4.1689,1.6595,1.0074,0.9491,2.8849,11.074,2.5003,0.4192,3.0286,6.4533,3.2711,6.3395,2.6199,11.6936,2.4225,2.1287,3.3388,0.6448,0.8011,3.2397,0.0014,0.0019,4.5699,3.3693,4.4363,8.9965,4.3603,1.656,4.4804,2.3512,2.3094,1.6504,0.6044,2.1662,4.883,4.9503,1.4581,0.3822,0.53,0.5242,1.7941,2.7632,3.4558,1.5411,0.1323,6.072,1.8975,0.5872,0.484]}

The burial took place on the 31st March, in presence, it is said, of 20,000 people, including a vast and imposing mass of clergy, and all except four members of the two Houses of Parliament.","token_len":140,"entropy":[7.0566,2.5674,5.3141,7.5272,1.8676,2.8501,4.6033,4.695,1.3239,5.6336,2.7383,1.1927,4.6862,2.4266,4.25,2.5944,9.3335,1.8786,0.0022,2.0406,4.5883,2.9365,0.1059,1.9071,0.7196,4.0015,0.1626,1.8993,9.4204,5.4274,0.0297,6.0421,3.8068,0.7299,0.0341,6.7884,2.7228,1.625,1.4227,2.1141,0.1631,0.5054,1.5098,0.9429,0.2357,0.0007,1.4938,3.0867,2.4673,2.6361,5.5888,1.881,7.9407,3.045,6.0838,4.0682,0.7559,3.6771,0.6115,4.6259,4.7962,0.4934,3.1525,3.8383,0.1409,0.1041,3.3204,2.6961,1.8694,1.0953,4.2617,3.8879,1.2762,1.3716,5.9383,4.4635,3.7104,4.3692,8.2774,0.0149,0.6244,3.3782,3.3947,1.1346,1.2159,1.1223,1.66,2.2825,1.4506,1.3344,5.2765,6.6132,0.7685,4.3257,0.8236,1.8606,3.9889,4.53,0.01,1.2186,0.9622,4.9219,0.0107,3.9072,0.8573,4.4554,8.2688,6.3401,7.7696,1.4656,1.2598,0.031,0.0131,9.1128,1.5307,0.1678,3.2342,0.9647,2.7862,2.7581,5.5456,3.9785,4.8241,4.1517,0.2934,2.9839,1.3287,2.548,4.7492,5.799,4.6477,1.9069,0.0734,0.198,6.1108,0.4236,0.3038,0.1034,0.8626]}

For example, a symmetrical design, like the one at this link, will make the wall at the extreme corners and the ends of the building look as if they were evenly spaced.","token_len":142,"entropy":[6.9337,6.0743,0.4349,1.8606,7.6353,7.1118,1.3649,0.7041,0.3729,7.7857,11.4054,8.767,1.9547,6.6625,7.1863,0.0041,0.0165,0.0036,8.4734,0.3665,1.3267,6.5352,0.4369,2.1136,3.2751,6.2989,0.01,1.4896,2.6029,7.8591,0.3766,5.2505,5.6685,2.614,6.6743,0.5403,7.8673,1.8323,5.9432,0.6232,7.3591,1.2409,7.1398,0.9894,0.8043,2.0176,5.9215,4.231,1.0366,6.6409,3.4517,1.3873,6.9266,5.3443,0.8634,0.4395,5.2232,1.3282,5.4832,3.1556,8.7783,1.0069,7.1647,1.4081,0.7128,6.1428,2.981,4.1908,8.2334,0.1487,5.2897,1.9134,2.0966,4.6508,7.9949,0.1272,6.4278,0.6899,1.7685,7.1192,1.0894,2.7301,0.297,2.617,4.5771,3.4509,5.4617,1.0615,3.821,3.9837,2.3985,6.9568,0.6863,2.5356,4.0463,2.2586,2.9959,1.9336,1.6176,0.3368,5.1528,0.5267,1.5601,1.8834,3.7753,0.6742,0.1071,1.5483,5.2214,0.4735,4.0972,3.7924,2.4108,1.4798,1.6549,3.6144,6.1106,4.038,0.2687,1.88,4.1824,0.8203,4.5641,4.6987,0.5866,8.1106,3.9727,3.7492,1.5066,7.3103,0.6587,0.1249,2.0017,2.8792,2.9733,0.6005,0.1377,0.9836,6.9401,0.9623,0.7268]}

At the same time, the old and established appellations were reorganized according to new principles and renamed as AOCs.","token_len":142,"entropy":[9.5842,0.1366,1.6259,9.1055,9.4216,8.3886,7.8485,2.7967,3.0523,8.6267,9.1206,5.2609,10.5739,1.2523,2.7129,2.2317,1.3076,2.1941,6.2528,6.6633,4.4563,0.7879,7.6335,1.3747,1.1238,15.5368,2.9905,0.0007,7.9049,1.6699,0.6712,2.2836,11.0882,0.7255,7.1272,2.3478,1.1294,2.3203,2.8679,3.3084,0.0107,2.425,10.2845,1.3016,4.0033,5.7878,2.8623,0.6881,2.9841,0.55,2.7,7.4916,0.8116,5.7172,3.4089,7.2079,0.5232,5.1382,7.0492,2.7703,1.8224,4.5127,0.0855,2.474,4.7714,4.978,1.0423,5.759,0.0361,6.3822,0.9479,0.1714,0.4884,4.3174,4.6803,1.9232,5.4076,4.4633,0.6119,1.2771,1.6716,3.1309,0.1968,4.2518,3.9975,5.9803,1.8271,4.646,5.6898,0.1061,6.2832,3.2284,1.7857,3.2574,7.6161,5.3199,6.786,0.2906,1.4784,3.2103,0.4833,0.5526,3.0465,5.7838,0.9089,0.053,0.2556,2.5583,5.6828,0.3619,6.1162,0.1008,2.0808,0.6729,6.1567,1.2924,5.3394,0.6039,0.2255,0.002,0.1303,1.1292,6.0053,5.3696,4.8469,1.2955,0.0538,0.8046,4.6197,3.0562,4.3806,0.004,3.9839,4.5105,2.0854,8.6134,2.8931,3.7834,0.1778,1.7098,0.6096]}

Toussaint Louverture, meanwhile, had won a decided tactical triumph over the Admiral.","token_len":144,"entropy":[8.3061,2.714,0.9892,11.1059,10.627,4.2747,1.8862,7.1379,7.8544,4.2356,3.3786,7.1344,8.9359,9.3969,0.0084,0.7723,3.8884,0.5377,7.8917,1.767,0.0373,1.4661,7.0702,0.395,1.988,4.3381,0.4416,4.3893,10.0765,1.2376,1.2706,1.0121,4.7802,1.4679,1.7855,4.9628,0.0465,1.4127,4.8387,3.1068,1.4741,3.4906,0.0011,3.0178,1.2784,4.0771,1.1686,3.0319,4.5403,0.5868,1.885,6.1232,1.4926,4.6431,1.0731,0.2703,0.0113,6.1577,4.2237,0.2305,0.0334,7.4255,5.6096,0.503,0.7045,5.976,0.7156,0.7296,1.6774,2.8612,1.1071,6.5659,0.3622,3.3141,0.0166,3.2832,1.5956,0.5417,1.3017,2.376,0.0016,2.9712,4.9791,0.0034,0.8437,5.111,0.0367,3.203,6.3996,3.0599,0.4551,1.081,3.6441,5.7266,3.1537,5.0534,2.4406,4.5009,2.1764,3.0467,4.1795,2.6022,3.0627,4.4769,2.0708,8.2617,4.2956,0.3533,6.2612,1.5095,0.911,5.5433,3.8552,0.0664,1.5437,4.0077,10.6373,0.0067,4.4356,7.1907,0.0053,0.0374,0.9,4.8601,0.0319,0.0011,0.0025,1.9254,0.0004,0.0006,1.2136,4.9119,0.0514,1.5658,5.4907,2.4676,11.2069,9.92,5.1948,1.73,0.4699,7.8803,1.7751]}

The solid tree allowed better weight bearing on the Indian's saddle which was placed directly on the Indian's pack or pack mule.","token_len":153,"entropy":[12.3149,5.1976,2.3173,5.9339,9.5529,10.2329,1.6821,10.3641,5.3053,2.5479,3.7521,0.564,4.1352,1.1464,1.5074,5.366,0.2817,0.3419,3.2334,0.6659,1.4093,11.3006,5.3401,4.0562,0.1159,2.3929,2.7985,0.0474,0.9102,7.841,14.8403,6.4861,6.6618,7.8718,5.7529,3.5735,1.392,1.5016,6.5463,5.4628,4.3071,3.5847,0.4988,0.4093,1.7804,4.2993,2.7497,5.3673,1.6286,5.9201,8.7542,3.0437,4.721,5.4678,4.1693,1.1263,2.2606,1.2435,4.2003,6.6623,9.932,2.0263,1.3411,4.2182,2.5628,4.5392,0.5912,1.0824,4.7705,2.0476,4.5198,2.0658,6.7854,1.4681,4.1064,1.4942,1.4797,6.4276,0.2912,0.3997,1.424,3.1815,1.0605,4.1907,3.0872,5.1329,4.5868,5.3061,0.9451,6.426,0.5182,8.3092,3.5672,0.3601,8.5367,1.2077,4.736,1.1322,2.1849,1.4325,5.7267,0.5168,0.0386,0.7999,4.432,2.9905,2.8299,1.7048,5.2208,4.1819,1.2073,3.819,1.2185,0.5433,3.806,2.3097,2.3885,4.3301,3.778,5.3882,1.81,4.8813,1.9927,7.8675,2.8898,0.6206,1.2726,7.5159,4.8013,7.4926,6.151,5.7842,4.9535,2.0161,0.3497,7.1521,4.096,4.7368,4.2177,1.6706,7.0272,4.3249,1.4556,0.2807,5.6848,0.316,10.1808,3.8539,4.5894,6.5922,1.7668,0.5254]}

The German group Seventh Avenue, formed in 1989, was one of more notable Christian power metal bands in the 1990s. They were one of the best albums of their genre. The Christian music market was booming in the 1990s and this meant that, unlike in the 1980s, Christian bands could be financially successful.\n\nIn spite of the band being Christian, Seventh Avenue did not shy away from the metal scene. They were actually one of the pioneers of metal in Christian music in Germany and Europe. Their albums were recorded with the help of the major label EMI and they were often included in Top 40 metal charts. Their debut album had an overall positive response from both the metal and Christian music audience.","token_len":154,"entropy":[6.6567,7.7246,15.5285,8.3011,10.0964,10.4614,3.1907,1.1259,5.3195,0.0689,1.284,2.1714,5.5505,6.1914,10.0528,6.8509,2.5827,3.1088,0.493,6.2805,0.434,1.5602,2.9483,0.0377,6.1462,7.2067,5.8953,4.0977,0.0475,0.9047,1.5604,0.4315,5.8062,0.113,0.5193,3.4348,1.8764,3.0247,0.0112,0.4145,5.1066,8.4248,0.5532,3.0832,5.3515,1.5505,2.2748,7.0912,3.6629,6.7242,1.6024,3.0135,1.8636,0.6573,1.3529,0.0077,1.4672,4.9505,5.1073,0.7953,5.1009,4.256,3.9274,0.8241,3.4896,0.0289,0.3187,2.9377,3.2118,2.868,2.3116,6.6518,0.7436,0.9632,1.9276,0.0105,2.4941,6.1096,0.0075,1.4414,4.5869,3.3435,5.6988,0.4786,3.4909,0.0761,2.7656,0.179,6.6553,0.0267,0.0094,2.9823,5.3123,1.8806,0.4667,1.7394,2.2559,6.5654,3.1519,0.0192,0.1845,3.7165,0.3426,2.3992,1.5013,9.9798,2.0247,2.9176,4.0626,2.445,4.9543,0.4394,2.8142,3.5023,1.6533,4.7407,2.7653,1.9398,1.9561,0.0118,2.3111,7.0708,2.4211,4.8572,0.3379,1.657,2.7574,1.6783,5.0624,4.6083,0.7179,5.5034,1.2282,3.2793,1.9879,0.5727,2.8772,3.0412,0.3635,6.4022,2.8244,4.6597,4.9317,3.6765,2.1979,4.0921,1.9979,3.2644,1.2856,3.7227,1.7395,5.0429,0.4479]}

In September, it moved its military bases and troops into the DPRK, effectively making the Soviet Union the dominant influence in the eastern half of the peninsula.","token_len":156,"entropy":[7.612,3.4047,0.1896,2.665,7.2147,5.5589,3.352,8.4778,0.8799,3.6909,7.2893,12.2415,3.895,5.2961,2.5101,5.9253,2.2694,4.3024,6.2298,3.775,1.8853,6.2874,8.7671,11.3286,5.1494,2.245,6.7806,1.316,5.3152,9.4047,0.3045,0.3096,7.4031,0.3038,3.2842,1.326,4.0333,0.0026,5.3504,1.3407,5.6749,5.507,3.342,1.5811,6.5273,5.3099,2.3451,5.4157,0.8537,6.3271,2.0531,5.9623,2.9795,9.7555,2.1378,2.046,3.9211,0.0273,5.2602,2.55,2.5207,1.48,1.9291,1.9316,2.7843,3.5421,0.8381,0.3595,1.9788,7.5302,6.9444,4.7731,4.4625,2.3769,0.3807,2.1695,3.1314,3.4049,7.9562,0.0163,0.002,1.7844,4.8755,4.6163,4.406,2.702,3.4838,10.3211,1.4444,1.7559,5.0922,2.4435,1.2372,6.8078,0.3184,4.2536,1.0417,0.0145,1.7564,4.2233,1.6281,4.1871,0.1123,6.4918,3.8294,2.1001,7.6846,0.0119,7.4039,0.8475,4.3998,2.2356,0.0798,1.0606,5.6085,4.1183,0.2452,0.2058,6.0724,0.7172,5.2716,0.1944,0.6843,4.0439,1.5397,3.2032,3.3491,0.3416,3.5956,4.6203,2.0672,3.9322,4.7674,2.5573,3.613,1.432,1.1328,3.0854,2.0634,5.2188,4.3995,1.4853,6.5119,0.2534,2.1162,4.3511,6.5479,0.8868,0.3732,6.864,1.2681,0.025,0.1343,2.9036,0.1179]}

This book, based on a large international survey, seeks to explain this apparent contradiction. It analyzes the social forces and their influence on the change of sexual patterns in Japan. It also identifies the psychological effects of sexual change on women themselves and their families and friends. The book considers the impact of increased sexual activity on the changing traditional Japanese family, and on the development of personal and collective ideals. Finally, it evaluates the effectiveness of government policies in regulating sexual activity.

He made thirteen appearances for The Bulls during that campaign, scoring once in a 3 - 1 win over Forest Green Rovers in March.[2]","token_len":172,"entropy":[8.1794,5.4913,0.1459,7.6276,5.3984,0.8502,2.9374,11.6241,3.4337,7.9425,4.3376,12.4613,10.2039,2.1201,0.0028,3.9353,2.5901,4.4235,5.3442,6.1549,3.3273,0.5661,2.5074,2.5383,3.5599,1.5557,1.272,1.2885,1.3801,9.2679,6.6172,3.7671,2.428,2.3283,4.0592,3.2399,5.9687,0.0031,3.5448,2.2781,7.9249,3.2178,3.2552,0.8213,9.3343,8.9624,2.4049,3.1545,8.102,0.1225,3.2962,0.826,2.0727,2.0157,2.8377,6.3333,0.7636,0.0223,4.4749,4.0223,0.0027,0.0038,2.9697,2.5912,3.849,1.5285,1.4821,9.3775,0.0017,2.1067,2.379,7.6143,0.0093,1.028,3.5947,0.0049,0.0002,3.3275,3.5863,1.6565,4.5791,0.1719,0.8529,3.1246,0.0004,2.5672,1.7934,6.0693,0.0949,0.8211,1.3495,0.4914,1.6224,2.3765,7.7002,0.0052,1.987,3.1746,6.7248,0.0257,5.4248,2.0376,0.1067,0.4098,0.0004,2.0918,4.3689,3.4895,2.1114,0.0095,0.0001,2.7557,8.6932,0.0009,1.0259,1.9631,1.1046,1.5612,4.5056,0.0617,0.0523,1.5181,5.3043,8.8658,4.0893,0.9869,1.1139,7.9785,0.1101,0.9903,2.4141,1.2864,2.1435,0.9092,1.2878,1.4716,0.6092,7.5577,0.2264,0.0116,0.5472,0.714,0.997,1.326,8.5185,0.3306,0.7311,4.2214,6.6465,4.3884,1.6259,2.0241,0.8395,1.4724,5.111,2.1206,2.741,3.0465,0.766,1.0866,1.4529,0.3918,7.0037,5.0721,7.1903,0.0005,2.1612,3.4938,5.3164,0.09,0.0562]}

An important class of problems of this type concern collections of objects that need to be processed sequentially. An example is a car production line where a robot needs to pick up the next car from the end of the line. One can also consider time series, e.g., stock prices. A large part of the literature consists of algorithms for constructing such graphs with arbitrary topologies. For example, see, e.g.,, the references therein [1\u201313].\nA significant drawback of the methods described in the literature is that they rely on heuristics.

The titles of two songs were also written by Simone ; One was originally written by the late George Gershwin and was a duet with Nat Cole, and the other was a song that was originally written by Richard Rodgers : \"I Never Knew What Love Was Until You Came Into My Life\"","token_len":190,"entropy":[5.8106,2.2138,0.3686,7.8999,12.059,1.0703,3.1574,0.0214,5.3191,1.3156,3.4754,4.2088,1.1709,10.2624,3.132,3.155,3.7587,0.7025,4.5976,2.2445,4.2161,1.2532,2.424,2.8516,2.3874,0.9259,2.47,0.0969,0.4469,5.9488,6.3682,2.7853,5.1374,9.8517,0.7258,3.2349,6.4639,4.1888,0.9286,5.2704,1.1434,3.5898,3.0896,0.1229,2.25,2.4164,3.536,2.8841,1.2748,3.3917,2.2851,2.6721,1.8458,2.3984,1.8032,0.8921,1.2868,3.1691,3.3783,1.9916,3.8868,2.7112,5.0291,1.1046,2.7955,0.1445,1.2446,5.3275,0.6186,6.6801,0.4855,0.8769,0.5883,1.1428,9.2657,1.3437,2.1143,4.5025,2.4755,1.8997,1.3849,0.0214,4.8388,0.5443,2.4821,3.3903,0.0026,4.6447,1.6479,3.5138,4.0996,1.6183,4.5802,2.8561,6.0902,2.3236,6.4623,0.5453,1.5348,3.0828,5.4137,2.3063,3.5979,0.8344,3.8957,2.7478,0.6812,1.9645,2.2704,1.2184,0.2947,3.8144,2.3108,3.8947,4.4719,0.0544,3.1751,9.7323,2.2008,2.2567,11.015,1.4266,1.6319,6.4213,2.7131,4.9204,3.2336,0.0776,1.8313,6.0459,1.0941,6.158,1.6826,3.0293,4.6359,2.5335,0.8389,0.354,10.567,6.3862,1.5375,5.2068,1.2824,0.9056,3.4203,2.5143,6.0603,4.5924,3.358,0.5149,0.2526,1.575,2.0691,3.7882,6.1114,0.0034,0.3041,9.4773,7.5508,2.1599,2.0558,0.6341,0.1267,0.4896,1.7237,2.242,2.8255,0.9584,2.6516,0.7497,0.1772,5.2004,5.7314,8.687,1.4788,2.7457,5.0552,4.7486,0.0063,2.6179,3.4653,0.4139,5.9403,3.4632,4.1523,4.1671,0.2653,0.5149,1.1793]}

Like most AI researchers, Rosenblatt was working on the problem of supervised learning, a method by which models, including neural networks, could automatically learn from a collection of labeled experimental data. The problem of supervised learning can be characterized by an example given to the network, and the network must decide how to classify the example. For example, a system may classify an image as \"dog\" if the image contains a white dog, a black and white dog, or a gray dog. In 1965, Rosenblatt and Marvin Minsky presented an artificial neural network model that could learn to classify images in a similar way to humans. The work of Rosenblatt and Minsky greatly influenced the fields of artificial intelligence (AI), computer science, cognitive science, cognitive neuroscience, and computational image processing.","token_len":195,"entropy":[13.4186,2.2042,4.296,3.1125,5.2229,0.1195,4.9919,2.3192,7.4555,1.1541,6.1256,0.7577,5.8599,7.1272,1.8005,0.8791,1.5428,1.2986,2.4342,1.8774,2.5802,8.4188,2.3956,0.0801,7.0455,3.5878,0.3039,3.6005,1.9198,8.4916,5.2107,0.0131,3.115,2.1945,0.6939,5.373,3.9154,7.0246,2.4251,0.3517,0.6064,0.0004,0.0005,1.9814,5.6919,0.7073,2.337,3.1635,0.1629,6.9253,0.3485,1.4226,2.2797,3.8178,3.5304,0.0164,5.2195,4.3292,4.5197,3.6453,0.2077,0.1161,2.8087,6.0783,2.3751,1.5066,3.2625,5.9731,0.0081,8.9938,8.3308,0.4941,0.6704,2.6482,2.2974,1.8435,0.8484,0.011,5.3978,0.3128,4.9807,1.2683,3.4751,5.1172,5.8557,2.0781,2.5379,5.9693,2.1379,2.4957,1.7035,2.3956,4.2647,4.1878,2.8747,0.4309,2.5438,1.1836,7.4286,1.0946,3.2328,0.7093,0.0493,2.1201,5.1631,2.4038,1.5358,2.5499,2.3244,1.7335,2.4282,6.948,1.3383,1.6759,1.5209,2.1475,2.1523,1.4978,5.8994,1.6974,1.2035,3.4419,1.2639,6.748,2.8089,0.5657,0.2818,1.0757,0.5763,3.137,0.4514,0.4943,2.653,10.3533,0.3014,1.0656,0.0002,0.0008,2.3118,7.1687,0.2475,0.006,4.2353,2.8094,3.5156,0.9261,0.0846,3.9993,2.1781,2.4648,2.9756,2.9997,0.2798,2.1168,3.09,1.6608,3.2668,0.4689,1.6466,4.8755,0.5499,1.5145,5.5573,2.9498,0.4743,0.0002,0.0014,0.3982,0.2588,0.0021,6.4953,2.5501,0.756,5.997,0.0494,2.3433,0.2503,3.4629,0.025,0.8629,2.1782,2.2073,0.4109,5.6002,0.9999,0.1409,5.2486,1.8017,0.1202,0.5071,3.311,8.5316,1.3729,0.5747]}
