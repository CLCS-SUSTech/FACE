{"id":3295,"ended":true,"length":367,"text":"In 1926, when the U.S. Highway system was first announced, there was a gap in US @ - @ 50 between Ely and Thistle. At the time the states of Utah and Nevada were not on the map. The US @ -@ 50 was to be \"straight, smooth and safe.\" It would take until 1958, however, for the first segment of the # 50 U.S. Highway to be opened in Texas.\n\nBy the time the US Highway came to Ely, Colorado, it was already in serious competition, in the form of the # 26 ( and its successor, the US Interstate Highway System ), with the railway network for travel between two points.\n\nSo the State of Colorado built its first highway that crossed the Continental Divide on a pass above Thistle as early as 1924 to compete with railroads. A bridge has been over the divide ever since.\n\nWhat you are seeing above is the \"official\" highway number sign that was placed on the road by the Colorado State highway Department in 1925. It reads \"U 50\", not \"U.S. 50\", which was only a designation given to the main paved route that connected Chicago to St. Louis and Seattle to Oakland. By the way, the road that crosses the Divide here is still U.S. Highway 50.\n\nBy the way, I have no idea how this road got its name. If it is related to the Scottish Highland Fling event in June ( the biggest annual Scottish festival in the country ), it is almost certainly NOT named for the pass over which the US Highway passes.\n\nYou will also probably see that the U.S. 50 ( the modern designation ) was shortened to match the length of the modern US # 28 between Ely and Thistle.\n\nFinally, if you keep heading east on this U.S. Highway to the next milestone at Thistle, you will also see what can only be a typo, right?\n\n.\n\n.","token_len":403,"entropy":[11.9046,0.2838,3.2323,1.6148,3.824,0.0292,0.0331,0.0183,9.5536,8.6007,0.6092,2.8682,4.3082,0.2576,3.4038,1.0546,1.0376,6.5221,0.9655,7.1041,12.9714,7.614,4.9979,5.7419,6.7523,14.2592,0.8779,8.1104,4.4238,1.8138,4.3993,1.3286,0.6321,3.3864,7.0423,1.8204,4.2534,0.4937,3.0319,0.9364,3.5608,4.2293,0.4817,2.5562,1.1716,2.1809,3.4739,3.347,1.7042,4.0254,0.3965,1.5819,5.7749,0.8555,6.1902,8.2389,4.7178,5.1964,1.4592,4.2381,1.4443,3.3828,2.0253,3.0402,3.5684,5.0669,2.3438,4.4722,0.0204,1.2704,0.9298,4.1057,6.843,0.2975,1.0446,5.4514,3.63,5.7702,0.3699,0.0123,0.1051,2.0358,1.1695,1.0733,2.8721,2.359,6.0933,0.7076,1.547,0.0282,3.7927,1.3832,1.7282,1.2591,2.2423,2.5488,6.4918,1.8132,9.1605,0.8696,6.207,0.9125,1.9956,0.4913,1.6786,2.5947,5.6435,4.4221,4.6045,4.5806,1.8547,2.0884,0.0058,1.1556,2.8972,6.9455,4.6758,8.9053,4.6518,2.6973,1.1918,0.4749,3.7916,4.9545,2.6951,1.9337,6.4606,2.865,1.4526,10.6397,4.766,5.4316,6.2011,1.417,4.2094,3.7799,2.7423,2.189,0.0002,5.1269,2.5386,6.5724,0.6124,0.8628,5.0589,2.5222,1.3509,3.2725,5.2119,4.7861,0.8003,7.0365,0.034,3.1879,2.9741,8.4609,6.6556,5.1542,0.0092,6.1597,3.2526,0.0069,4.2906,5.216,6.6083,0.6826,6.6742,1.7446,1.5191,4.4327,6.0548,6.7482,0.543,6.2333,0.6439,4.9902,3.09,0.0026,0.7356,0.8305,0.0002,5.1377,4.737,4.1146,2.6091,2.4818,0.6233,1.3042,4.4051,4.4424,0.3693,3.8375,6.083,7.1108,3.2609,1.6326,3.9636,1.0958,0.5088,4.0083,2.1548,0.8107,2.7338,1.2122,7.0076,5.441,0.9076,3.4895,0.4524,1.9821,3.0183,1.6099,4.3459,10.4283,4.219,3.4402,0.9937,0.7778,3.109,0.3087,0.9467,0.8459,2.3713,2.1135,1.9736,5.2956,2.7238,5.4447,2.794,0.7573,0.8163,5.7033,9.7178,4.0105,2.5913,4.4651,7.916,1.1801,4.1853,0.2798,0.2767,2.4593,5.8368,2.1525,5.2384,0.4417,5.9656,1.1773,3.6557,0.102,1.4168,3.5492,2.5309,3.7996,0.7003,4.757,7.0581,0.9372,4.4365,6.9423,0.8612,0.018,0.077,5.5407,3.6039,0.9511,0.4464,0.0002,4.4393,0.7203,1.615,0.0641,3.6046,2.6494,2.7352,0.3835,1.8127,2.6445,3.1536,2.9165,1.7158,0.5902,1.0468,3.826,1.6096,2.5454,7.3011,0.2013,0.9241,9.9674,4.3086,7.2141,8.7512,10.6998,2.7133,6.4173,4.9562,7.3922,6.9561,5.9349,5.0085,6.5036,0.6839,0.4844,2.5211,3.341,1.3466,1.6197,5.3384,0.3407,7.5023,3.5752,2.7072,1.146,6.8548,2.9818,4.6575,1.113,3.586,1.6112,4.8076,0.939,0.8655,0.0003,4.6847,2.9368,1.9868,5.0392,2.3339,2.7858,0.969,3.9423,0.2457,0.0035,0.0436,3.4319,3.8496,5.0844,6.7854,3.3106,3.2888,2.0918,5.9284,0.7526,9.8061,0.5765,5.8725,0.1099,0.3499,6.7715,2.0778,4.7678,6.5294,6.882,3.2409,0.0647,0.702,0.0005,0.6657,1.0416,0.0002,5.4834,0.0693,3.5874,0.2304,6.5495,6.7386,2.6739,2.1484,3.486,5.2825,0.2895,0.0012,0.0517,1.8885,3.5264,2.3842,4.8138,8.1657,5.2144,2.545,0.0014,0.6092,0.7359,0.4047,3.9624,0.5141,4.1021,4.5778,0.8937,0.0423,6.2805,6.5901,2.6371,5.9966,1.5989,0.8451,0.0003,6.6675,0.9441,0.0004,1.9465]}

{"id":2095,"ended":true,"length":402,"text":"According to literary critic David < unk >, the labyrinth of the novel's title refers to `` a series of labyrinths that are contingent upon matters of history, geography, and biography.' [ 9 ] As one character says of the first maze, `This labyrinth, like the world, has an end' (Bergman, 2001, 4). As the novel unfolds, through the narratives of four people involved in mysterious incidents of the past, the labyrinth becomes not a place without an end but a system that is inherently cyclical in nature and is therefore subject to change and evolution, if only by degrees. In terms of the novel's exploration of the themes of evolution and nature, the labyrinth of the text is presented as the place of the inevitable and final death. In the novel as in the real world, people cannot be allowed to live forever; death is a necessity that must be recognized and understood. In the context of the novel, this comes through the characters' attempts to create an eternal life for their loved ones, both by trying to discover what caused their mysterious death and by trying to understand what life will be like with a deceased parent or spouse, or in some cases what will be like after one has lost one's life. All the four stories have a protagonist who struggles against his or her inevitable fate, while also finding ways to cope with the loss of his or her life. In doing so, the protagonist often attempts to achieve some sort of eternal life; as the story develops, he or she will come to realize that life is far more meaningful and valuable when it is lived as it should be enjoyed, at least temporarily and for the moment, accepting a limited and finite nature that is also a part of life. The search for the answers to the mysteries of the past will lead to the revelation of truths that may threaten society and the status quo, but to live the life of a hero as well as the life one can have is a choice each person must make for himself or herself.","token_len":404,"entropy":[1.9909,11.0226,1.7704,3.6638,13.7023,11.0947,4.0787,6.7366,3.2296,1.8012,11.1014,1.6083,3.1981,3.5243,2.7856,4.0065,4.8833,0.159,11.2282,6.6867,3.616,0.0314,3.2501,0.6363,2.3784,2.2145,13.1293,0.9794,9.6739,0.804,4.6847,1.3317,2.8081,0.2396,1.5183,8.0338,7.0625,5.078,7.2365,0.1215,4.1034,4.2223,5.4443,3.2606,2.5804,0.6665,4.0596,5.026,0.7215,1.8116,3.8622,1.7886,3.2944,2.626,1.2044,5.6866,1.5237,2.3362,3.4943,3.6372,5.1396,3.7569,5.0895,4.7042,2.6135,1.3469,4.9707,1.9517,5.0543,1.0332,3.7664,2.2074,2.2822,3.6981,0.2804,6.3133,1.2007,7.1457,0.6094,4.9233,4.4878,5.1938,0.4652,8.6613,4.4926,2.9283,2.2386,1.5001,0.3831,1.4088,2.3224,2.6524,6.5159,3.0657,3.0574,6.2151,3.8463,0.0941,0.6037,0.4882,6.37,2.4832,2.1154,5.7475,7.446,0.0587,2.2881,1.2704,2.4423,3.0187,4.0791,3.3839,0.0451,1.4519,2.35,5.3352,3.0305,6.0171,3.0657,2.6471,7.1937,0.3511,2.7118,6.3823,0.0012,1.605,3.1444,0.2747,7.3721,0.1498,1.1302,5.558,0.4151,5.9611,0.8917,4.6305,0.3685,1.4442,1.4349,2.7528,0.6049,6.9626,1.1313,6.1145,0.5896,2.6479,4.7705,1.3496,1.6078,6.9962,2.4544,6.9963,3.6995,2.8147,2.5483,1.6149,1.9911,6.242,0.9794,1.0723,2.9293,0.3479,0.1167,5.8536,5.3219,2.5973,4.4995,0.0649,2.6637,3.0939,3.4082,4.9754,1.0616,2.4343,4.5108,3.0514,1.3596,0.2387,5.4915,1.3839,3.2308,0.9441,2.5636,1.1198,4.8036,0.0305,0.9951,0.7067,0.5718,2.668,7.4545,3.6173,0.7335,4.9116,1.5734,4.272,0.1305,4.5413,2.4019,4.5286,2.3401,3.0033,2.8573,2.5197,0.0411,1.4594,4.9133,3.6848,5.7508,0.048,6.2034,2.4072,6.1348,1.5296,8.2308,1.6784,0.552,0.3808,2.4822,0.0569,2.8586,1.3394,4.651,3.6884,1.1568,0.075,4.5159,3.0614,5.8474,3.6959,1.5621,3.8491,2.8507,2.0769,3.9966,2.7071,0.6429,6.6954,2.3222,1.8306,3.0392,3.6162,5.8943,2.4067,3.412,2.4457,0.0427,3.3943,0.4349,5.6425,2.7454,7.2764,5.8828,3.7224,1.7634,6.7804,0.9112,5.4138,3.7493,2.35,2.7102,0.002,5.8279,2.4176,1.2367,3.8158,2.623,4.8472,3.0888,0.2518,2.7491,0.1183,1.2171,2.7896,0.4763,1.1856,0.1219,0.002,3.3015,0.684,2.2126,5.7555,0.0731,0.0905,1.3031,2.1814,4.9319,5.0551,0.073,5.479,3.6397,1.4606,0.0007,4.3691,1.7088,4.0072,3.8434,2.2106,2.572,3.5567,0.44,1.7462,0.2176,0.0016,4.2271,3.7661,0.0854,1.521,0.3596,2.6404,0.8862,5.1892,1.347,3.9812,1.6505,5.1997,4.1541,1.5315,0.8473,3.9006,3.6027,1.9984,1.6982,0.0921,8.0062,1.8645,4.8044,0.3007,3.7462,4.4405,2.555,1.8705,3.6961,1.6335,10.6254,4.2431,5.955,3.0567,3.2231,5.2836,2.7212,1.5922,4.6592,2.6085,2.857,0.0033,2.4514,0.5839,1.8843,7.8258,0.0873,2.6862,3.9981,0.4551,1.5956,2.208,0.1698,1.4554,1.8166,4.5915,3.0825,0.9356,1.6854,5.8045,0.4726,5.0112,0.9185,3.3001,6.8961,5.6481,1.3519,1.4797,5.7806,0.0904,1.4844,2.125,5.3203,4.7509,3.0391,0.8535,1.2162,1.4141,4.7262,4.3689,2.7617,0.2454,2.5456,1.9618,6.0048,3.9523,3.7701,4.4484,2.1063,4.237,6.7989,1.5106,1.6292,0.1441,3.6719,2.3625,0.7363,0.5545,0.3261]}

There was much less sea covered by sea ice than in 1982. There were many floes on the sea and on the glaciers, some containing many large icebergs. The glaciers looked very dirty from the mud and the silt mixed with the ice. The ice seemed more rotten than last year also.\n\nWe made many observations during the next two days.

{"id":4369,"ended":true,"length":349,"text":"The demonstration profile as designed by Holland included a 360 \u00b0 turn around Fairchild's air traffic control tower. Holland had not attempted this maneuver in previous air show demonstrations. During the final performance the P-38 was inverted, then allowed to regain a straight course by \"punching\" off the power, while being held at that pitch by hand-brakes.\n\nAfter the \"Punch Off\" maneuver the airplane was inverted at the tail so that all propellers would be forward and the elevator would be in the forward position.\n\nThe pilot was then allowed to punch up on the power, allowing the airplane to level off and then climb to the top of the flight path.\n\nIn the final turn around the pilot was allowed to turn on and off the power as the airplane neared to turn rate. The pilot would be instructed on proper turn rate as the airplane turned with minimal power. At turn rate the plane climbed to the ceiling and banked to vertical.\n\nIt is not known how many times the demonstration was performed.\n\nThe airplane featured a new cowling with an open \"U\" with a transparent section where the pilot or observer could see what was behind the airplane.\n\nIn addition to the demonstration the airplane was loaned to several air forces for static displays.\n\nFollowing flight test of the prototype in February of 1943 Holland accepted an order for 10 more P-38Cs.\n\nFor Holland to get production P-38Cs and remain in business he negotiated a contract with Fairchild for 50 P-38Cs of the same specifications. His deal with Fairchild gave him production rights and free-hand in the design program.\n\nHolland decided to build the airplane without a canopy. It didn't have any structural bracing for this purpose. Holland had also designed a cowling made of Plexiglas to cover the underside of the airplane. If the airplane had a canopied cockpit like the PBY the cowling was removed.","token_len":404,"entropy":[10.1276,12.1157,6.0143,7.0029,1.2259,10.8779,5.7059,1.6402,7.0624,7.3461,5.2756,3.2447,14.1282,1.6292,1.597,6.7981,5.7609,0.5676,3.0935,1.8113,5.6928,4.0194,4.4026,5.6779,3.2,2.9923,2.0198,4.2972,4.4502,4.8514,1.2528,0.9403,5.9581,0.5236,5.2234,5.1938,4.4609,7.429,2.3849,2.4214,2.3925,8.2724,2.0451,4.4755,6.4852,0.1051,6.7067,3.9536,4.1817,3.7545,4.419,6.1344,4.0756,2.3774,0.0677,0.8199,5.2961,0.6214,6.7725,5.2882,4.0218,4.9146,4.3843,2.6591,6.5231,5.7894,1.3779,7.2723,4.1472,5.5375,3.8848,0.6656,1.5322,0.0122,3.9857,0.9338,5.454,3.7453,3.5907,4.6013,0.2911,1.7554,2.4471,4.348,1.6581,5.1138,3.8753,1.7977,5.4943,6.94,0.4096,5.0222,4.9843,0.132,3.3763,1.1566,6.0234,2.0297,1.6642,6.9412,3.1327,1.2823,3.259,1.0463,4.3548,0.7065,0.3805,2.6716,0.0002,1.4562,3.7656,2.4654,3.981,2.9541,0.0995,8.4333,4.8703,4.072,0.5522,3.8103,2.2284,4.7136,0.6818,2.0842,0.0709,7.4772,1.5187,2.2269,2.8422,3.9513,1.686,1.2703,2.5342,0.5379,0.3472,4.8674,2.7374,0.504,1.2184,0.0002,3.4244,1.3177,1.6825,5.8832,3.5182,1.0906,4.6008,1.6658,1.7329,0.0584,2.9604,3.4074,3.9708,0.679,0.4626,1.9176,3.4975,2.2767,1.4223,6.2731,0.0009,6.3171,3.461,10.3148,0.905,1.6968,1.85,3.8797,3.4681,4.0466,3.8753,7.3033,3.3449,2.3515,4.1162,1.532,0.7971,4.1111,5.5262,5.6716,3.9732,1.3157,4.2178,6.2575,0.1775,0.9184,4.3959,5.7681,1.156,0.8373,6.1088,1.3545,9.6159,0.0368,2.2389,6.4985,1.207,1.1647,0.0002,4.665,1.3843,2.6829,0.3966,1.8914,2.0655,2.4248,0.6005,7.3197,1.4829,1.3496,1.3041,1.0267,0.0003,1.565,3.6395,6.0678,1.4184,4.5898,11.7432,1.6165,4.9038,2.8301,4.5794,5.339,6.4102,0.4482,5.2806,1.0651,8.5457,7.1462,5.3247,0.5947,3.7239,6.9147,5.7254,0.6673,1.5181,4.1815,0.7982,4.8443,0.5374,3.7308,0.4352,1.1257,0.0002,3.1033,2.7091,0.4323,0.6898,3.7435,3.9144,2.1679,1.993,11.1202,0.0184,1.3794,4.7942,5.0407,5.3752,2.7325,8.8888,6.9655,0.8857,0.7979,0.0002,5.8027,4.617,2.1157,3.2929,0.166,4.5879,3.3288,3.9185,2.8409,4.5417,4.3978,7.8324,2.825,1.876,1.0472,5.2429,4.9986,2.2656,0.0225,0.0215,6.3188,1.4993,1.2078,0.0002,5.0186,8.0179,3.4018,4.8956,5.6324,4.6776,0.0206,0.0421,0.481,4.0865,7.4297,1.142,4.8929,6.0927,7.8882,0.9902,1.6456,0.6186,7.4656,0.0004,1.4527,4.3389,2.6985,0.0077,0.0331,0.4054,4.2317,2.1024,1.5349,4.2077,0.8924,5.8959,4.3773,2.9168,1.1398,0.0015,5.1016,0.9673,6.8481,1.6765,3.316,6.203,4.2121,5.1848,5.0654,1.3884,3.424,7.0299,0.6825,0.6964,0.0002,3.8266,0.0088,0.0035,5.0597,0.4185,3.7041,1.2585,4.0191,4.415,2.6278,6.4671,1.9363,3.3397,5.8208,0.0016,1.6422,2.2665,5.36,10.7983,0.0904,3.6862,3.2798,2.3215,0.6584,4.3721,2.6882,4.2774,3.6636,1.2454,8.071,0.0058,5.7724,0.9594,6.5824,0.0192,0.0532,2.9521,3.6416,0.3301,4.7218,0.1743,0.0784,1.5369,0.5698,5.8681,1.0871,1.9792,1.3952,1.3466,8.4565,0.08,0.2176,3.7808,5.5566,0.4677,1.6482,12.2026,5.1602,2.4977,0.0474,3.4955,5.2704,1.2398]}
{"id":2411,"ended":true,"length":378,"text":"Bates believed that the eyes were benefited by exposure to sunlight. He stated that `` persons with normal sight can look directly at the sun, or at the strongest artificial light, without seeing any glare on the retinas. On the other hand, a person who has damaged or destroyed the retina by an accident, or by disease, can not observe direct sunlight with the same ease as a person with good sight. \u00bb In 1900, Dr. Bates had shown that persons with severe damage to the retina, or who were blind, were not susceptible to this solar radiation. At the time, however, Dr. Bates noted that some of his patients regained their sight after exposure to direct sunlight.\n\nIn 1911, Dr. Charles R. Peck tested the hypothesis that certain cells in the eyes of a mammal could recover to normal levels after exposure to sunlight. An animal was fed a daily dose of thiamine sulfate during three months. The experimenters also provided the animals with constant exposure to bright sunlight and artificial light in the form of incandescent lamps. After three months, the thiamine sulfate had no effect on the functioning of any cell type. However, certain cells increased their production of certain blood products that were necessary for normal eye function. These cells responded better to direct sunlight.\n\nThe experimenter found that mice, which had been deprived of their eyesight for an average of 10 months, could perceive light again following the use of a solar system. They were sensitive to both direct sunlight and artificial light. The mice, which had been injected with an experimental solution, responded very favorably to the solar radiation. However, the treatment could not restore normal visual function in any of the animals. The research team later used a drug to stimulate the cells in the retina to produce more normal cells.\n\nThere had been earlier speculation that this vitamin could have a direct effect on the brain. These experiments indicated that the eyes could be involved in the body\u2019s ability to absorb thiamine.","token_len":404,"entropy":[8.3012,8.5694,1.2594,1.7044,9.2834,1.8255,12.8621,0.9706,5.6079,0.0959,3.1194,1.4173,2.4812,5.1049,0.4353,11.637,13.238,2.4872,4.748,4.3305,4.036,4.3691,4.8599,0.7328,1.0739,1.9188,1.8698,4.8022,2.1122,1.3261,10.4498,7.7691,0.4754,1.6166,2.6253,3.7115,2.2028,5.6555,3.8491,0.4858,6.494,0.479,2.2908,5.6344,0.7565,0.2563,0.0104,0.091,3.7658,0.4388,1.7049,1.462,7.3832,2.7788,3.7705,1.3361,1.4439,3.8497,4.4992,1.0892,1.8037,1.7291,2.1126,4.5194,0.4762,2.3532,3.1064,5.4961,5.2947,0.4372,4.0831,1.588,3.6791,5.5504,1.237,1.0762,0.6093,1.222,5.617,1.3159,1.5218,11.0508,3.7274,7.1686,0.5788,3.058,0.0836,2.5758,4.4535,5.06,0.6143,5.0085,0.3889,4.9696,5.7361,0.3265,0.4915,0.6693,2.8049,1.7809,2.7558,2.1069,3.0386,1.0335,2.6636,3.0857,4.2068,0.1386,4.8257,9.3706,3.4528,0.632,5.1829,0.7982,0.6842,0.768,3.394,0.0012,3.0238,0.0013,0.2071,4.4104,0.2469,3.9963,2.1065,1.8742,0.8556,9.2322,1.5464,1.0854,1.7207,2.9167,0.138,3.4379,0.137,0.7751,3.1284,0.0042,2.5043,4.8685,0.2128,1.041,0.0007,5.7825,3.62,0.237,7.5549,6.1685,1.1612,3.8815,0.2554,5.25,4.9703,1.2129,0.2019,3.5113,1.3256,2.9307,8.4336,2.201,7.5622,3.9083,2.1623,2.1553,1.8599,0.686,0.0247,1.5341,0.4491,5.4784,2.6891,2.9447,4.6236,1.2053,4.7917,2.2834,0.0062,6.8188,0.6359,0.5563,4.995,0.0961,5.4181,4.6357,1.7587,1.2217,1.5066,6.0789,2.1903,4.8898,5.634,2.4814,1.5968,0.1472,7.9748,3.5055,0.1334,4.058,1.376,2.5727,8.169,0.2237,3.9815,1.6043,3.6172,0.0099,6.7783,0.0542,0.0211,1.2137,0.4786,3.1908,1.1739,0.2938,0.4655,0.7273,5.0313,0.0033,0.011,1.0063,0.0017,3.442,2.8085,0.5783,0.2624,0.3254,7.5847,0.0205,3.3376,2.3915,5.5876,0.8827,2.9517,0.0031,5.3569,0.5888,5.8426,1.4217,3.3668,0.0461,5.2093,6.6142,4.6205,3.0042,1.5711,4.7853,0.3466,1.6379,4.8303,0.552,0.3795,2.722,2.2121,4.9191,4.0908,0.2546,3.5202,0.1792,2.426,1.6685,0.0002,2.3819,4.7222,1.8118,3.7842,0.166,6.2455,3.2207,2.6651,1.1546,0.9865,3.9462,0.0337,3.1871,3.0322,1.9992,0.619,4.3755,1.5402,0.0373,3.9973,2.2604,0.3246,2.6626,5.9022,2.8083,7.425,5.6597,2.1112,4.05,0.0043,1.7292,5.9448,4.6457,2.2427,3.1717,1.5492,5.4215,0.0824,4.8218,1.2061,0.5344,0.114,0.5736,0.1089,0.6409,1.8814,2.8523,3.5639,2.3711,1.0046,0.6286,7.199,0.0518,3.5997,4.625,4.3597,2.9977,4.8794,3.5554,4.1638,0.1467,1.1884,3.381,1.6903,0.5796,2.8713,0.0015,1.402,4.3635,5.7655,0.7188,2.9503,2.29,3.8995,0.8903,2.4257,3.937,1.4839,0.2075,1.8834,0.6175,1.8663,5.1695,2.3253,5.3894,5.006,1.4684,5.9922,1.6273,2.6541,0.7568,1.2078,1.9354,0.4081,3.5479,0.7413,1.8014,3.3556,6.1475,2.1511,0.5358,1.3275,0.0002,5.0977,4.8599,0.2045,6.012,4.9963,0.2307,4.4007,4.8529,1.9168,3.4167,1.5712,3.487,0.4724,0.0481,0.8291,3.4934,0.7406,5.4889,3.4453,2.9029,0.085,1.4725,6.9241,2.5908,1.2451,6.1225,0.2632,1.5012,6.2667,16.426,7.4436,6.5787,2.2289,0.0027,3.1314,8.5035,0.0565,0.0253,1.5848]}

Douglas, who became an active member, marched in a second march for women\u2019s rights the following year.\n\n\u201cI did not see her speaking of the rights of the American Negro as a matter of American equality for all,\u201d Douglas said, in a 1963 interview.\n\nAt one point, Douglas considered running for Congress in her home city of Augusta, Ga. But two years later, Douglas and her husband moved to New York, where she worked as a social worker and was a founding member of the Women\u2019s Liberation Front. She would become editor of the radical feminist magazine Ms.\n\nWomen\u2019s liberation remained a central tenet of Douglas\u2019 life. She is perhaps best-remembered in feminist circles for her defense of Andrea Dworkin. In 1990, Dworkin was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for her work on abolition, and for her advocacy of sex work and pornography. But the committee was outraged when the Swedish Academy, which picked the recipient, asked Dworkin to write a foreword. Douglas agreed to take on the task. When their letter was released six months later, Dworkin\u2019s name was dropped from the prize and both Douglas and Dworkin received death threats.\n\n\u201cI do not regret writing that letter,\u201d Douglas told the BBC in 2006. \u201cThere was nothing about the Nobel Peace Prize that I was interested in. I don\u2019t understand why these right-wing forces \u2014 the Catholic Church, Margaret Thatcher, the White House \u2014 would be so afraid of somebody like Andrea, who was a strong woman.

{"id":4762,"ended":false,"length":363,"text":"Shortly after sending the demo, Anka received a telephone call and was told that Tonight Show bandleader < unk > Henderson was angry because Carson wanted to use a theme song written by ``Gillislee'' rather than one written by Paul Simon, a guest who appeared on the show last month. Simon, who wrote ``The Boxer'' in 1976, had played a ``Gillislee'' lyric on Carson on Aug. 22. The opening lyric begins with ``Wish I could be a bird, free to soar.''\n\n``I said `Paul Simon is one of my idols.' and I play guitar, and I said I would be honored to be on the show,'' Gillislee said from Pittsburgh, where the band was rehearsing for Tuesday night. ``I never expected to be on the show. I figured I would be at the Tonight Show at a later date.... I thought a request from Jack would be nice.''\n\nGillislee has been offered the chance to participate in a new NBC show called ``The Glee Project'' -- in which bands compete for $100,000 by winning a series of performance challenges -- but has declined for now.\n\nCarson, who has his own show on NBC, said he didn't know what Gillislee had planned. ``Anything he wants to do will be fine with me,'' Carson said.\n\nDuring a teleconference Friday morning, Carson and Gillislee joked that they could ``go back and forth'' until they were so tired they could hardly string a coherent sentence together.\n\nDespite Gillislee's enthusiasm for the Tonight Show appearance and Carson's interest in his work, Gillislee said the two have never met. He said he recently did a call-back audition in Los Angeles for Carson, but said Carson didn't know him.\n\nCarson said he invited the Detroit-based band to play as the featured musical act on the program and said, ``I think they're good.''","token_len":405,"entropy":[5.5154,7.1975,1.7051,8.4206,1.5703,7.5801,5.7914,5.3225,0.6803,7.1224,0.099,5.015,3.0436,1.512,1.1918,13.9391,0.9306,11.9667,2.6608,12.3927,10.9448,4.5625,6.266,10.0834,1.1273,7.2559,3.5875,9.6059,4.8256,0.4378,4.4555,2.9056,7.2817,0.378,6.8658,0.3105,11.817,4.6994,4.5714,4.7634,5.12,0.6988,6.3603,0.0026,5.0567,1.5643,0.0964,6.0244,3.2998,2.6335,2.4343,7.1004,5.0285,3.895,0.4804,0.9986,0.5251,3.9755,2.9129,0.2385,8.9376,2.4252,0.5806,4.4839,3.2223,3.0588,8.984,1.5269,2.1171,2.8215,4.8056,0.2483,2.8793,4.8036,2.5637,4.8418,1.3227,0.1854,0.0247,0.0013,0.1335,7.0912,1.7089,4.6082,6.0686,7.856,0.0057,3.37,1.8482,2.4515,6.4439,4.55,6.3219,1.3736,2.645,5.3435,3.6405,1.3382,0.8096,2.9544,2.3157,7.6037,2.2322,8.1144,2.915,3.3783,3.0268,2.816,0.0003,4.0708,2.1545,3.8896,4.332,6.4853,1.4018,2.1278,5.0465,0.1774,2.0988,3.8553,3.3378,5.4052,2.4851,8.3024,6.254,2.3832,1.4917,1.3598,2.4409,3.5208,2.4574,2.8565,6.0961,0.4277,1.4068,2.4686,0.9135,0.457,1.087,10.2004,0.0596,0.0005,0.8871,6.7477,6.9442,1.5279,1.9578,2.6484,1.5811,1.6245,2.1177,0.0096,1.4949,5.1764,0.7887,2.1614,1.6018,0.9768,5.0203,3.1937,1.1265,1.239,1.1444,0.8946,0.2771,1.2816,0.8126,6.3824,1.624,1.438,1.1869,4.1598,1.0512,10.0744,0.0588,5.007,3.794,3.7112,0.1391,6.8722,2.3335,2.3327,5.5254,8.4132,2.0153,8.0166,3.1399,0.662,1.9423,1.929,0.3296,0.0002,2.5432,0.0281,0.0011,0.001,3.9252,1.7241,6.8843,1.9623,2.0346,0.0484,5.2736,0.1927,1.6008,4.2239,5.941,2.4991,1.8193,1.7092,1.6964,4.5819,2.8596,4.3802,1.4062,4.5798,4.4446,0.1981,11.1615,5.758,1.0684,2.9031,2.1978,0.2654,0.0028,4.9168,4.3071,1.3195,3.7677,0.026,6.7316,6.4963,2.8256,0.9716,2.193,2.0228,5.5132,0.763,0.3335,1.103,0.0003,3.7624,0.0056,1.8498,0.7482,1.6282,5.9509,0.2779,2.5752,1.1734,1.7272,1.0662,2.0358,0.8232,3.6699,0.0011,1.9096,2.1844,6.6768,0.0054,0.0005,3.3209,2.64,1.2533,3.4274,8.0805,3.8833,3.7135,0.7024,0.6604,4.2278,0.5706,3.7591,2.286,0.1105,0.5222,2.1238,0.1501,0.3009,1.3367,0.0003,5.5478,1.7185,5.1138,0.8364,4.5622,2.8177,0.5686,1.4219,3.6194,1.197,0.0059,0.0007,5.7995,1.3307,1.6862,3.3433,7.0889,3.0271,2.9536,0.996,1.9477,2.1544,4.3054,1.7741,2.6095,7.3888,4.1616,1.5817,1.5355,5.3074,10.2622,2.4719,8.3626,1.3851,0.0509,0.191,0.8329,0.0002,6.8053,3.2498,0.0066,0.0017,0.1748,5.0033,1.2735,0.916,5.7132,0.006,7.4091,3.166,3.8028,0.0379,5.3541,0.2171,3.1216,3.6746,0.4839,1.8557,0.0108,0.0012,0.8,2.5992,3.2039,2.7531,2.0871,1.3826,0.7428,2.4235,0.7532,0.6806,5.6464,5.4388,0.9488,5.6311,4.8553,5.4805,5.9876,3.5091,3.1581,0.0011,2.4918,3.9231,1.525,1.4488,2.8386,4.773,2.8366,0.0008,2.4755,3.6196,1.0275,0.5667,0.0002,2.0984,0.0039,1.321,0.7462,6.5428,3.7358,8.9449,1.6553,0.5194,3.1554,0.4636,2.5085,5.1807,2.9547,6.8634,5.3788,4.207,1.391,1.5378,4.617,2.9378,1.94,4.3552,0.7513,1.0443,2.7832,2.7105,1.6099,3.11,2.2737]}
{"id":2604,"ended":false,"length":347,"text":"Before the influx of automobiles, Spokane's electric streetcar and interurban lines played a dominant role in moving people and goods around Spokane. Streetcars were installed as early as 1888, when they were first known as trolley cars. Within four decades, a trolley service would crisscross the city. It would end in 1958, when an experimental trolley line ran from Liberty Hill to Riverside Park. But now, years later, those nostalgic lines are back on the track with a modern twist.\n\nThe Spokane Street Railway, which runs from Custer to Riverfront Park, and the Eastern Washington Railway and Light Company, which operates from downtown to Fairchild Air Force Base, are both operating modern electric streetcars from Spokane Transit Department's garage. The streetcars are painted in retro fashion to look like they did in the 1920s and '30s - think of the cars as \"throwback\" trains. Both lines are using cars that have a more streamlined look compared to the sleek lines that the Spokane Street Railway was using in the 1980s.\n\nOn any given day, you can find people on both streetcars. They're especially popular for rides to downtown or Riverside Park.

{"id":4532,"ended":true,"length":361,"text":"NAACP leaders offered Du Bois the position of Director of Publicity and Research. He accepted the job in the summer of 1910, and moved to New York after resigning from Atlanta University.\n\nThe book The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual, by a leading member of the NAACP, describes Du Bois as, \u201ca bright young man of good family\u2026with the gift of an eloquent tongue capable of converting into strong argument those of the negro masses who might be persuaded to see the logical issues for themselves.\u201d\n\nIn the late 1910s, Du Bois and other prominent black ministers and social theorists led an \u201cinterdenominational crusade\u201d to bring about racial equality in the United States. The crusade involved rallies, marches, and demonstrations and was intended to bring about immediate change. Despite widespread sympathy for its goal, the crusade failed and its leaders felt that their efforts were in vain. Du Bois left New York shortly afterward, moving to France.\n\nDu Bois had moved in with writer James Weldon Johnson, a close friend from their Atlanta years. Johnson had recently written a poem entitled \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing,\u201d which became the first song and hymn in the United States to be dedicated to African-American history.\n\nDu Bois wrote several books during his stay in Paris as well as more than a dozen articles\u2014all published in French. He also lectured on the subjects of black leadership in Africa as well as the civil rights movement of the United States. Du Bois continued to work on projects to bring about racial equality until his death in 1964 at the age of 93. (He had served in the United States Army from 1917 to 1919 in France and was involved with the American effort to fight fascism in Europe.)\n\nThis project is generously supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities.

He devoted his last major work, `` Memoirs of Queen Charlotte <\/ unk > <\/ unk > (1931), to the early life of this English queen who served as wife and mother of George III, George IV, William IV, and Edward VII.","token_len":409,"entropy":[12.2899,2.0726,3.4837,11.2748,2.2534,8.5286,4.5187,0.8706,10.7087,0.1633,1.5548,3.7956,1.0879,4.9186,1.4573,1.0532,4.4489,3.9804,0.8747,5.2121,1.7733,2.0547,3.1565,7.2343,3.1706,9.8555,13.1579,11.6249,9.1128,6.8414,6.5972,10.8642,6.0487,1.4729,1.2659,1.582,7.1579,2.1984,0.1657,2.0824,2.853,1.395,6.4551,1.9384,1.7816,1.4436,4.3512,6.8688,5.0894,0.2889,8.8345,0.6588,0.0121,0.5876,3.9398,4.0409,2.1709,1.8748,3.8186,8.0669,0.2384,0.0103,0.0517,2.9309,3.5514,4.9039,0.3669,4.1462,2.4644,3.1087,0.0452,0.0016,0.0554,2.5151,0.7952,3.7857,0.1242,1.5756,0.0002,2.0644,6.8103,2.0061,5.1807,3.5871,1.2493,3.7685,2.6612,0.8028,1.4813,5.8068,0.3902,1.6463,4.789,4.4375,3.4144,3.2732,1.2974,4.9986,6.2936,0.4978,1.481,4.6824,6.0344,4.6134,1.9483,1.0155,1.8432,2.8877,0.0,4.6181,0.7875,1.5251,6.5995,3.7756,1.3132,1.9519,0.0166,1.4174,3.9783,0.7794,4.4608,4.6372,1.003,4.7642,0.4362,7.5147,0.7278,2.0859,1.9511,0.0002,1.2027,0.0002,3.4561,3.6504,3.3194,6.8572,1.4647,0.7114,1.5428,1.6105,4.2626,2.4725,5.079,4.4907,4.4581,7.4628,3.9926,1.3711,2.7993,6.2219,0.3915,0.4166,0.9485,4.0883,3.7356,4.2823,0.0222,3.8198,7.3617,6.0809,5.3329,0.1494,0.0018,0.0232,0.5191,0.1849,3.7873,0.3838,4.5177,5.5535,0.1295,0.7712,5.4209,4.4476,0.9515,1.1549,3.3471,3.7038,7.2993,1.4406,3.7466,5.8562,0.1298,0.0012,0.0158,9.2349,2.9008,0.0123,0.0009,0.0136,2.665,2.63,4.3345,0.0526,0.3307,3.4664,0.2301,0.0011,0.0214,2.2593,0.2101,3.0719,0.9896,1.3619,6.4205,5.4403,2.8496,3.1581,2.6277,8.8276,2.8589,3.9922,0.3738,3.4367,0.0002,1.4464,1.1524,0.0002,0.7804,0.0002,1.7243,4.0488,3.2063,3.0752,8.7575,0.1901,0.0014,0.0124,3.0163,0.054,0.0787,1.761,0.0562,0.0011,0.0064,0.1358,0.5659,0.0055,0.001,0.005,0.288,0.0575,0.0143,0.0005,0.0019,0.2329,0.0077,0.001,0.0029,0.342,0.0821,0.8607,0.3982,0.9501,4.121,0.198,0.5446,0.5714,0.4264,0.4245,0.0096,0.0554,0.0048,0.1661,0.0001,0.0932,3.9045,4.3929,0.9792,0.4486,0.7492,7.0657,0.0368,0.1541,0.2492,7.5277,4.5219,3.5604,0.0126,0.001,0.0049,6.6665,2.0642,0.0078,0.026,0.5729,0.0908,3.5646,0.2696,2.8763,6.4097,1.7107,3.0218,7.2016,0.1168,1.5361,0.966,2.9759,0.5239,5.9548,5.2442,1.9047,3.4202,5.2235,3.8732,0.7356,5.8396,1.8771,1.8999,0.8896,4.1388,1.199,1.5256,4.6809,1.7037,0.4366,4.5266,2.8482,0.3703,0.5942,2.65,2.3658,0.4247,0.8338,0.0002,4.6306,3.503,5.5993,2.645,0.9466,0.7729,6.3717,2.7697,4.3179,2.5942,4.6075,1.8196,1.3783,5.3205,0.6764,3.8996,0.9073,1.7694,5.1219,2.4719,7.1216,2.4618,1.1417,1.406,5.0932,1.4237,4.3976,0.8219,0.9554,1.9582,6.2522,2.6954,2.385,5.2735,1.2542,1.1808,1.0153,4.0284,0.0195,0.015,0.0881,1.6184,1.878,1.7105,0.0147,0.001,0.0048,2.1818,0.0183,0.0011,0.0139,0.1926,0.1999,1.1231,0.2767,0.2923,1.3766,5.2168,1.8301,0.0717,4.4783,3.8785,0.8167,1.6541,0.5523,0.0381,0.3154,0.0736,0.0554,0.0191,0.7528,0.0733,0.0529,0.0243,0.0074,0.0009,0.0263,0.0369,0.0025,0.0049,0.029,0.0098,0.1123]}
{"id":2767,"ended":true,"length":350,"text":"With advent of automated telescopes and improvements in spectroscopes, a number of collaborations have been made to map the Universe in redshift space. By combining redshift with angular position data, a redshift map of the sky can be constructed. On the other hand, angular maps of sky can be used to identify the point sources of interest. Here, an experimental study has been made of the sky distribution of the sources ( ) in the Magellanic Clouds. We propose the concept of galaxy distribution functions (GFDs), which can be described by a set of functions, [1\u20134] and, [5\u201321]. In terms of redshift, galaxies fall into two broad classes, namely Galactic and Local Dwarf (LD). The GFD of Local Dwarf galaxies has been studied earlier [22]. The GFD of galactic sources is not well understood at present. The GFDs provide the most promising model to describe galaxy distributions. The GFD of the Magellanic Clouds has been constructed by combining redshift and angular measurements. These two components are mathematically combined to form the GFD of galaxies. It is also tested whether the redshift component can replace angular or angular and radial velocities to further improve the GFD. Both the angular and radial component have been considered to obtain the GFD. The result is obtained by using a simple model in which the mass of the Milky Way is 10 times that of the Local Dwarf Galaxy, the density of dark matter is 5 times that of baryonic matter, and the halo of dark matter has radius of only 1 pc. The GFD does not agree well with the results of previous works, both in accuracy and in the mass of the Galaxy.\n\nReferences\n\n1. B.A.P. Achermann, M.F.G.M.C.

As a result of his work in the winning teams of 1933 and 1934, Petoskey was selected fourth overall by the Chicago Bears of the National Football League in the 1935 draft.\n\nPetoskey played three seasons with Chicago before the Bears lost the 1936 NFL championship game. In 1940, he retired from professional football and moved to St. Louis.\n\nAt one time, Petoskey was an active member of the Lions Club. He was involved in the organization of the St. Louis Lions Club World Food Fair, which was held here in November and December of 1938. His work to help those in need continued for some time afterward as Petoskey helped provide food for the hungry here and around the world.\n\nOn May 25, 1944, at the age of 56, he was elected to the U. S. House of Representatives, representing Michigan's 4th congressional district. Petoskey was a member of the committee that oversaw the drafting or revision of the United States Interstate Highway and Defense Acts. He resigned from Congress in the wake of his wife Lillian's death. Petoskey was the manager of the Cardinals in 1946.\n\nIn 1952, Petoskey was elected to the board of directors of the St. Louis Cardinals. He was active on this board until his death. Later in life, Petoskey became increasingly ill and suffered a stroke in 1982. Since then, he had resided at the Shepherd of the Hills Lutheran Home in St. Charles. He died at this home in 1988 at the age of 88.\n\n\"Petoskey was a great football player, but also a first-rate man,\" said Cardinals Vice President Tom Tuohy. \"There are many great Cardinals who can look back upon their time with Petoskey with great affection of the time they spent with him.\"","token_len":415,"entropy":[5.051,6.5915,0.1778,1.6817,8.8065,6.318,5.9081,4.3736,5.47,4.2668,0.5165,2.3823,1.507,4.3556,2.1205,0.5761,13.4241,6.5846,0.6842,0.0032,9.2424,0.0136,1.2752,4.8842,6.3068,2.8084,2.0177,3.4313,2.142,1.57,0.459,2.4172,1.7277,5.5566,0.0091,0.0013,1.7303,8.1971,1.5755,3.7434,0.547,0.0206,0.3642,1.0587,5.0298,0.7466,4.7618,1.3348,0.8841,4.3823,2.2944,0.8048,8.734,5.382,2.5748,3.9346,0.9046,0.8054,0.0975,0.5826,0.0094,0.0008,1.3825,2.5327,6.5286,0.297,1.123,0.2122,2.2118,1.0668,4.7627,0.0434,2.3292,0.2454,0.02,0.9162,2.5798,2.5411,2.0585,0.3111,0.9618,0.0006,1.5474,0.0226,0.0011,2.1577,3.358,0.2292,1.579,3.8481,1.6071,5.2348,0.811,4.8198,2.4959,4.8457,4.8646,1.5183,0.1859,2.5339,2.0699,4.2606,0.2544,0.952,4.4122,0.7582,2.6553,0.3481,1.5595,3.4723,0.3978,4.9975,0.0672,0.2206,1.5475,1.768,0.0002,4.7564,5.241,1.7571,0.3205,0.7942,0.0089,0.0013,1.1251,2.7693,3.5791,0.6461,0.0277,0.2309,5.4776,4.3149,1.5024,1.0586,1.3253,4.591,0.1352,1.2508,4.7383,1.2782,0.9997,3.4835,0.0642,0.0271,3.212,3.1286,8.1763,10.2288,3.6515,1.5533,1.7784,1.2028,0.5139,6.4039,0.7048,3.5949,3.8006,0.1031,0.468,3.0734,0.3954,4.3653,4.1591,6.0118,2.5596,4.8483,1.2092,0.1296,4.7574,3.8897,4.2263,0.2323,5.0595,3.0366,2.9405,0.0106,0.0018,2.2866,4.3182,1.2294,1.6324,1.2739,4.0328,7.1213,2.4739,3.0563,0.0292,0.9826,0.3408,0.5464,0.0002,4.3273,2.3576,3.2944,0.0563,3.6229,0.0938,4.3848,0.7986,2.3322,0.0052,4.7246,0.1047,2.2538,0.7598,3.0982,1.2717,0.3107,3.945,0.0023,3.9894,0.0029,1.8535,0.0998,0.0171,2.0059,3.3976,2.8775,2.5236,4.2872,0.0158,3.1395,0.0162,0.6978,2.2027,0.012,0.0026,1.1757,2.4644,0.7549,0.0479,0.1284,4.1927,0.7427,5.226,0.3681,4.921,8.6561,6.7595,0.03,0.2111,4.156,0.1846,9.7682,1.0419,3.2661,7.4208,4.2538,1.72,1.4279,5.8716,1.1742,2.1922,1.2738,4.0418,2.8582,0.001,3.8549,5.6316,7.8846,0.7002,0.1451,0.2554,1.7546,3.1466,0.0086,0.0041,1.2497,2.7345,10.378,0.2889,0.4104,9.0543,3.9456,4.2459,1.5112,0.5622,0.0001,1.8195,3.326,0.1211,0.7892,0.0102,0.0033,1.1575,1.1986,0.7959,0.2304,6.3976,0.0497,0.7439,0.219,0.5557,3.6996,0.0059,0.0863,0.8978,1.2459,0.7959,1.0118,6.2983,2.7873,5.6019,0.4676,1.9307,0.9074,0.8818,1.5805,5.8026,2.0247,2.8335,0.1429,1.0419,0.0083,0.004,3.3651,7.8472,6.5301,1.1337,3.517,2.6435,1.3564,1.0683,5.0225,0.3088,5.3346,0.9899,0.1667,0.515,3.3854,6.6917,2.7362,1.443,10.1177,6.4441,1.584,4.5982,7.4388,4.9705,1.2592,1.9205,0.0175,4.4679,2.4901,1.968,1.9227,2.2607,5.7519,0.8531,1.1531,5.1516,2.9503,1.1041,0.0061,0.0023,3.6185,0.1275,0.4113,0.0001,4.8167,2.8642,0.0773,0.006,1.1895,0.8116,2.4421,5.6638,0.4052,1.0409,3.2421,3.0993,0.2814,8.8727,0.7481,2.0554,4.7689,1.553,0.4869,5.2063,4.6078,0.0788,5.7417,9.5386,3.3646,0.0044,0.5363,0.062,5.0913,1.6231,1.1449,1.907,3.8051,2.4856,4.3209,6.3882,0.4622,4.2868,3.0746,1.5818,1.6957,5.3877,0.0218,0.0097,4.4347,2.9385,3.3334,7.3274,3.3018,3.3452,3.0623,0.9764,0.9365,0.1313,1.7511]}

{"id":4761,"ended":true,"length":397,"text":"When Johnny Carson, a fan of jazz music, was preparing to take over as the permanent host of The Tonight Show starting in October 1962, he recognized that he would need a repertoire that would appeal to a wide range of guests\u2014and a set list that would highlight the talent of his band, The Tonight Show Band, as well as the comedy troupes appearing on The Ed Sullivan Show (which aired on TV for 24 seasons). Because The Ed Sullivan Show had a long tradition of featuring a wide variety of musical acts from around the world, Carson needed a list of music to accommodate a broad and diverse spectrum of performers.\n\nCarson\u2019s team assembled a list of about 600 possible songs from which to choose songs that could cover the broad range and diversity of musical styles as well as various comedic acts appearing on The Ed Sullivan Show. Carson was certain he would find an equally good selection of comedians to guest on the show, so he worked closely with The Tonight Show Band to develop and build their repertoire in areas that both comedians and musical acts would enjoy.\n\nThe music Carson chose fit the variety that he wanted to maintain on The Tonight Show, as well as cover a broader range of styles. While some artists were included on The Ed Sullivan Show as popular singers like Elvis Presley or Dinah Shore, Carson went for a more eclectic group of acts such as Benny Goodman, Ella Fitzgerald, and the popular instrumentalists the Wrecking Crew.\n\nThe band and its individual members selected the songs they would perform on The Tonight Show. During rehearsal of the band, songs were rehearsed to allow the individual members of the band the opportunity to improvise and try out their performances. The Tonight Show Band often added their own songs to add to the repertoire.\n\nCarson was also aware of the music that was being broadcast worldwide through The Ed Sullivan Show. His repertoire was a combination of European as well as African American music. Carson\u2019s choice of music was based upon his desire to cover a broad range of music and to include a diverse selection of styles.","token_len":420,"entropy":[10.2788,4.6375,3.3072,2.7059,7.0922,1.1316,7.5928,2.6711,0.5281,2.9297,7.3721,0.7012,3.2441,2.6385,1.746,2.0663,9.0954,2.1052,0.3269,2.9934,0.6448,0.0001,7.7802,1.5955,3.5803,5.5477,0.4522,1.1992,7.435,1.5496,1.97,2.3406,1.8333,1.3038,9.1516,1.5327,1.3681,3.626,0.0922,1.5462,2.0356,1.7405,0.0062,6.9003,5.0986,2.6223,3.6766,4.7406,5.2329,0.6354,1.2275,7.1309,1.6972,5.6909,0.9103,2.3565,3.133,2.4783,4.2714,3.9036,0.0021,5.7425,1.6336,2.456,0.1307,0.0072,1.3074,6.8927,9.282,0.6958,0.001,8.0715,0.8362,2.8561,8.0861,0.0024,0.0036,3.7032,2.6028,3.9821,1.6027,5.0533,2.612,5.1686,2.6412,1.434,6.4109,4.1385,5.2201,0.0071,0.0203,2.1537,2.3941,3.1351,2.4738,0.1445,3.9544,2.909,2.602,1.1932,0.0078,2.866,2.9963,2.5916,2.5435,0.0164,0.7315,0.2369,0.5212,4.4771,1.1704,3.9782,1.194,4.7819,2.7573,5.0522,2.1715,2.5218,4.9687,0.6996,6.2232,0.0822,4.9806,0.5301,1.4431,0.0004,2.4569,0.0048,16.0151,7.8582,4.5211,4.3887,5.031,0.733,1.1802,0.1544,4.1397,4.6512,5.1637,2.9406,2.6394,4.6244,0.2784,0.8392,6.2968,1.8477,2.6683,5.7507,1.6633,3.8049,1.6059,5.1443,2.7817,0.092,2.1269,2.3321,5.7739,0.2785,0.0167,6.1415,6.4617,5.8704,6.1611,0.2642,0.8263,0.7242,0.0009,0.0037,0.4742,2.625,2.7208,4.8269,2.6994,1.5093,1.9466,3.272,6.6209,5.483,2.8554,0.7129,6.9665,1.8954,6.0708,1.1384,1.137,0.3619,1.1469,2.314,0.2791,5.5809,2.887,0.0134,3.659,1.1639,0.0022,1.3468,1.0163,2.6067,2.6912,4.5739,2.9856,1.6198,3.958,7.9447,1.7261,6.3365,5.024,0.0915,4.1124,1.978,2.0648,1.9638,0.4367,1.1328,0.0001,1.9477,5.847,1.3165,1.9892,5.3078,1.4381,5.4051,3.9463,2.1766,1.4659,0.5506,6.4522,2.3694,0.3175,0.809,0.0009,1.4251,2.7966,0.9198,0.0092,7.4195,1.5569,5.3682,0.3888,0.0064,2.9004,1.7785,4.5977,3.1446,4.5167,2.3528,6.0036,2.1761,1.7196,0.5754,0.001,0.0044,3.439,7.602,5.4058,3.1816,4.0919,0.7199,0.0001,1.5751,11.2493,0.1201,1.5755,0.322,1.4387,6.5871,2.3845,1.8818,0.836,3.0573,3.3553,0.4614,4.386,3.98,0.003,6.3925,0.3882,0.3775,8.1148,0.0121,0.0109,0.1213,1.6967,3.1758,7.0513,8.4065,2.0527,6.0289,6.0201,3.2387,0.8426,0.0548,0.8422,1.4123,0.0002,2.0132,4.6644,5.3902,3.1466,6.6193,1.1512,4.0658,2.4224,1.8258,2.669,2.2396,4.4992,1.1237,0.4508,0.4489,0.0023,1.7997,4.8296,3.6214,4.7037,0.9678,3.917,3.4301,6.8249,0.7869,4.4014,0.0003,2.3696,4.0301,2.0095,6.3972,1.4725,2.3494,0.7214,0.3657,3.2765,0.8642,0.0115,2.8211,0.0171,1.9206,5.9859,1.4321,2.1931,6.1678,0.7042,1.8826,5.1187,0.0044,0.8946,5.8999,5.744,3.6726,0.0881,2.779,0.5622,7.1578,0.4623,0.4572,1.874,1.626,1.3212,0.0001,2.1348,0.0061,2.7013,2.7033,3.7227,1.1744,0.5748,4.9202,1.6213,2.2762,1.3722,5.9681,7.2935,4.5122,2.2314,0.5485,0.0014,0.0061,1.1544,3.5418,5.8107,2.6539,3.7453,3.6992,0.0146,7.6669,7.7919,0.0399,0.0076,4.4508,1.7215,2.7303,1.3826,3.2825,7.2739,0.0128,0.0405,5.6118,0.3013,2.5207,2.0431,2.6843,3.5587,1.9338,2.677,0.1174,5.5731,1.3111,1.9937,0.543,0.0054,3.5942,3.0994,2.0715,3.5207,1.93,2.963,3.4576,0.0765,3.533,1.0934]}

{"id":15,"ended":true,"length":361,"text":"With the losing continuing, more rumors began to surface. Unlike before, the rumors were about player moves rather than coaching changes. The majority of rumors were that the Blue Jackets would either have center R. J. Umberger traded or a defenseman sent out.\n\nColumbus Blue Jackets \u2013 Umberger \u2013 Is He Gone?\n\nJarmo Kekalainen\u2019s offseason continues on Sunday, with the Blue Jackets GM beginning his annual end-of-season exit interview with the media, and the Columbus Dispatch provided an early glimpse of what could be up for discussion and rumor mill activity.\n\nAfter last season\u2019s team finished 22-28-12 and placed 12th out of 15 teams in the NHL\u2019s Western Conference, the GM is going to have to look for a replacement for Umberger and likely a replacement for Brandon Dubinsky, as well. Both Umberger and Dubinsky were UFA at the conclusion of the 2014-2015 season and are both under contract for two more seasons.\n\nThe Blue Jackets need to sign restricted free agents R. J. Umberger and Brandon Dubinsky and restricted free agents have to sign and to retain some amount of salary for them to remain in Columbus. There is speculation that Umberger is likely headed to Philadelphia, which will have to take on part of the cap hit.\n\nHe would be a rental, although Philly appears to be making a major push for a playoff run right now after a few lean years, and this could be for only a few weeks. He could help them to a late playoff berth, and could then be allowed to leave after the playoffs.\n\nThere has been a rumor that the Columbus Blue Jackets were hoping to pair Panarin with Umberger. That could be part of reason why this rumor might have been floated to see if the Blue Jackets might bite.\n\nThat could put them at a position to lose Umberger.

{"id":1323,"ended":true,"length":378,"text":"On September 5, a tropical cyclone formed off the coast of Costa Rica. It also headed northwest and dissipated over the southern part of Baja California on September 15. The lowest reported wind speed was 50 mph (85 km\/h) in a few localities. The maximum winds were estimated by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center at 65 mph (100 km\/h).\n\nIn spite of the large area involved, only one of the five weather stations recorded sustained winds above 32 mph (52 km\/h) during the entire event.\n\nWinds speeds during the tropical cyclone are shown by the graphic below. Note that maximum winds were recorded at only two stations.\n\n(MORE: Hurricanes: Where Them All the Time )\n\nThe graphic and maps above show observed wind patterns during the tropical cyclone. The first one shows how deep the tropical cyclone was during the day on September 5. The second map shows the circulation of the deep tropical cyclone on the morning of September 6. The third map shows both the circulation of the deep tropical cyclone on September 6 and 7. The fourth map shows the circulation of the deep tropical cyclone on September 7 only. The final map and graphic show the deep tropical cyclone\u2019s circulation on September 8.\n\nTropical cyclones that develop far away from land can cause a variety of effects. Tropical cyclones are large-scale circulations of warm air at the earth\u2019s surface. Wind and rain are generated when hot air rises and cool air flows into the low pressure region of the storm. Sometimes, warm air moves up along the storm\u2019s front (like warm air along a beach). In the case of tropical cyclones that form far away from land, the storm\u2019s circulation causes this air to \u201cstretch\u201d and \u201cblow\u201d to the left and right from the storm. This stretching and blowing can create high waves and rip current currents that draw in waves and swells from the open sea. Sometimes it can also cause severe storms that hit land.","token_len":422,"entropy":[7.5319,3.4721,0.3214,4.3141,10.0236,3.8959,0.0037,5.9628,3.318,0.646,0.7655,0.0245,4.7297,0.0039,1.4099,2.1305,4.9673,6.7334,3.8769,3.0773,8.156,0.003,3.1705,0.6944,3.6135,1.9153,0.0051,7.0457,0.0621,0.0398,3.1014,0.2552,4.105,0.46,2.0492,7.6961,5.805,3.177,0.8632,0.7761,4.9742,0.6951,1.3676,4.9946,0.5096,0.0708,0.0061,1.1639,2.4761,3.6887,4.6598,5.5829,1.3044,0.7388,2.143,3.8932,4.1967,0.5942,5.7477,4.5257,1.0372,6.4764,1.0121,0.2086,0.1296,0.97,4.9643,0.2786,0.1084,1.8937,0.0242,0.0043,0.0011,0.9464,0.6487,0.0007,3.5419,7.0716,0.0044,0.6854,4.7708,4.8756,7.0133,0.6218,5.8025,2.5665,3.0454,0.3103,3.4571,6.0342,1.0482,3.3537,3.0618,0.8021,1.5622,6.676,0.5416,0.2237,4.9167,0.0526,0.0022,0.0017,1.0804,3.203,0.3437,3.7195,4.7632,0.2751,1.3837,0.0002,5.4907,1.4276,9.2202,3.9864,0.9768,3.1828,0.0297,0.0507,2.1772,5.1339,4.3869,0.7,4.5712,0.6287,0.5067,4.6355,0.7798,5.6337,0.9689,1.6873,1.6421,1.7282,5.4108,1.8083,1.8228,1.9827,0.7854,0.0002,4.7455,5.8429,0.2793,5.7692,3.151,4.0621,8.8992,5.9841,7.27,1.9008,3.2674,0.1124,0.0002,1.6927,7.7416,5.7884,4.6743,2.3433,0.984,8.7408,1.0997,4.9283,2.6246,0.4764,1.9891,0.028,0.0092,1.1055,1.5734,4.9387,3.6783,0.6417,3.7358,8.1036,0.6667,2.0652,0.1414,0.024,2.1912,3.0187,0.5229,2.6225,3.7122,0.2001,1.0164,0.8988,0.52,0.3576,4.7695,0.1063,1.3487,7.4795,1.6258,1.1879,7.4672,0.7211,0.0239,0.0186,2.8236,1.9135,2.6395,0.0778,0.0674,1.3717,0.2715,1.526,0.5828,0.5063,0.0967,6.4725,1.0373,1.1762,1.2514,0.1345,0.3673,0.117,0.0216,0.0204,1.743,1.1372,0.8558,0.1065,9.6589,0.2898,1.5876,0.5624,0.2684,0.0908,0.6027,0.3878,0.2351,0.0804,0.1612,0.0155,0.0112,0.0337,0.2321,0.8706,0.3845,8.0452,0.4329,1.9226,3.7405,0.7466,6.6941,1.8295,1.8512,0.8891,6.2148,0.2503,0.04,0.0157,14.838,7.4866,4.0135,1.7365,1.5293,0.4563,1.204,0.866,0.3073,0.0002,5.7739,0.6536,0.0129,0.3947,0.71,4.5097,4.3334,6.9235,3.139,0.1688,3.0645,2.7738,2.2655,3.0187,4.4129,0.0007,2.8426,1.796,4.2641,0.1812,0.0966,2.5003,6.1236,3.7526,0.0217,7.9925,0.4039,1.7599,4.5156,1.5204,4.9465,2.0245,5.5089,14.9853,2.1156,2.461,0.0927,1.0381,5.7727,4.1234,1.7874,2.0143,4.4407,2.4531,4.8659,0.9045,3.5583,2.817,1.7487,2.4981,3.8062,2.3467,0.3248,6.364,1.8422,2.7134,1.0844,0.1883,3.9198,0.9082,6.4279,1.1216,4.5772,0.1551,3.5702,3.4947,4.9451,0.3816,3.2565,7.4812,0.0692,0.0822,6.3217,4.749,4.4122,6.3776,1.9476,5.8595,1.0544,5.1778,2.3175,3.2039,2.0158,1.7426,0.0164,1.072,0.0389,0.0664,2.7776,3.4932,1.1685,0.2409,0.0329,0.0747,0.0799,1.4166,3.8531,7.2678,0.0194,0.0116,3.2841,4.6534,5.5546,3.9255,0.5856,15.5542,4.8468,5.4528,0.8073,4.0406,6.9676,4.0627,6.2192,0.6054,6.3724,0.6699,0.6811,2.9917,0.5046,7.1811,1.5096,0.2141,5.5538,0.7565,2.6925,2.1299,2.856,9.2718,2.4445,0.9472,2.3274,3.0714,4.4772,3.9105,1.4037,8.0953,6.5947,5.9858,1.483,6.46,3.8107,5.5717,1.7019,7.3306,0.0382,3.5303,0.4004,6.7039,2.8698,0.5343,5.2555,4.588,1.1187,1.2457,1.2149,3.8231,2.2335,1.7864,5.1495,3.7408,1.1343]}

Peter Gicas of E! thought the video was `` sweet `` and said, `` And while the visuals here \u2014 Taylor in a white gown, surrounded by a group of beautiful women, surrounded by men in suits, and surrounded by a group of beautiful men ``, are a feast on the eyes, the lyrics are an assault of the soul. ``\n\nBuckley said the video was inspired by Taylor's favorite book, \"Catcher in the Rye, and she said the whole set was very intentional.\n\n\"I wanted the video to focus on Taylor and not try to make her 'pretty'. I also wanted to create an overall impression that reflected her personality,\" said Buckley.\n\nIn the video, Taylor wears a silver gown to dance with several shirtless men in suits on a dance floor.\n\nShe gets topless while wearing a white gown in front of more men in suits and surrounded by women in black and white dresses in a red carpet line.\n\nTaylor, 25, who has said she has no regrets about her \"Shake It Off\" performance at the MTV Video Music Awards in September, told Billboard and E! in November that she was inspired by the song`s lyrics to make the video.\n\n\"I feel like it`s so easy to make fun of yourself and get down on yourself. If it`s not working out for you, it`s pretty easy to just get right back up and brush yourself off and just shake it off, which is what `Shake It Off` is basically saying. I really love that about the song,\" Taylor said.\n\nTaylor Swift released her debut album \"Fearless\" in 2008, and has sold over 30.2 million copies worldwide.\n\nShe is currently in the top 15 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles.\n\n\"Shake It Off\" has topped the Billboard Digital Single, Digital Tracks and Digital Sales Charts and is currently in the top 15 on the Billboard Hot 100.","token_len":422,"entropy":[8.3735,3.8438,7.629,1.2396,4.6262,3.1907,1.0062,3.9817,2.5429,6.1453,2.9344,1.9884,9.3797,4.7875,13.6815,3.6697,5.8576,2.6615,8.7487,2.085,1.368,0.7193,11.9558,14.4141,5.3965,0.6788,2.557,1.7605,0.2406,6.5903,7.1796,2.4407,7.2913,5.8034,11.6385,9.7795,6.8687,1.3726,3.4951,3.8634,1.0936,5.4775,0.0309,2.5885,2.8142,0.0169,5.8873,1.7214,1.2546,4.2586,0.0679,4.3222,2.7526,3.9223,1.1032,1.8235,2.2615,0.1199,1.9185,2.405,0.0184,3.0085,2.2692,10.3814,5.2816,1.9815,3.3685,7.4423,6.5764,1.1126,3.5881,1.0657,1.8371,7.7245,1.4802,4.9296,5.6529,5.0531,1.9148,4.4585,1.2836,3.412,2.8683,0.0294,6.1461,4.9109,0.9774,2.3793,1.6359,1.2239,1.2244,3.736,0.1318,4.7196,0.5131,5.5572,3.2587,0.44,3.0455,7.9361,1.0783,0.0562,0.007,0.0005,4.2879,2.9877,3.4249,2.4932,3.3827,3.7299,6.1394,1.1171,3.8929,7.5652,1.4825,4.629,0.0004,2.8921,2.1166,4.1094,2.55,3.6157,0.0857,5.8988,0.1494,3.0662,1.9955,2.2501,5.6802,0.1769,2.4112,0.8842,6.494,7.0077,3.8957,1.6132,4.2244,0.2328,1.0743,3.731,2.2153,5.5875,4.105,1.7831,8.3235,1.3401,1.3323,2.3492,2.8045,3.348,0.1595,0.9457,0.0003,3.5015,1.4984,0.9734,0.1876,1.6561,5.3421,0.3992,6.0143,3.5737,4.6077,5.8427,1.3133,4.9085,10.5055,0.017,0.7218,2.4344,2.6627,4.9642,1.2669,4.7903,0.0967,0.868,2.3126,0.0003,3.0187,5.3955,2.7846,4.4141,4.0616,1.9774,0.6463,1.5803,1.8204,3.2944,1.7757,0.0092,6.5425,1.4156,1.2637,0.9015,2.008,8.8696,0.0514,3.0272,0.6552,3.5952,1.5069,0.6846,2.8883,3.9033,2.5104,5.0076,3.7122,8.3654,0.4544,0.4846,0.0002,2.6055,3.4906,5.4002,0.0471,3.205,1.9216,4.4239,0.3221,2.4412,1.554,2.5916,0.3824,1.1903,5.2928,9.1718,1.9145,0.6161,0.0234,0.5806,4.3969,2.9459,0.682,3.2261,0.4087,0.0038,0.0064,1.8556,3.1089,0.347,3.2446,3.8596,5.7373,4.6617,0.156,3.8348,4.1933,0.5193,0.3777,1.9776,1.847,0.2206,1.254,3.1813,10.1825,0.0647,1.1189,3.9369,3.3675,1.6675,1.4833,1.569,0.2484,0.0003,1.7911,0.7416,3.8766,0.5233,1.9331,3.2861,0.0124,3.8119,4.3908,0.382,2.5274,3.3157,0.0233,2.8072,1.6874,3.9629,4.5814,0.6868,2.0282,1.9821,4.3143,2.6046,2.1509,0.0024,1.7293,5.5283,1.7136,1.9017,0.1771,0.2919,1.9272,0.9472,0.0363,5.8876,1.001,0.2686,2.6126,3.3358,5.7286,0.532,1.917,1.0834,8.464,4.3687,0.3779,2.0769,2.4475,7.204,0.4253,0.0096,3.1641,3.7686,0.8,1.594,6.3435,1.1341,0.0036,0.0816,0.0009,2.11,0.921,7.2989,4.0102,1.6232,1.7339,3.6099,3.4833,1.8591,4.9809,2.0781,0.9933,1.687,2.0339,0.2827,0.3813,0.3459,0.0002,1.8757,7.4208,5.0583,1.3494,4.0263,0.3994,2.6072,10.2146,0.3294,0.3659,0.6135,3.7682,1.8854,1.2644,2.379,4.2746,1.1539,3.941,5.8125,2.0205,0.0038,0.8011,1.3039,0.25,1.2719,0.0003,3.068,2.3332,2.2549,2.1619,0.9347,3.195,4.2648,1.4566,0.5406,4.5455,0.0008,0.1036,0.0084,0.3692,2.233,0.0116,8.172,0.0008,5.035,1.5166,0.0003,4.2099,2.8638,0.041,0.2112,0.0007,0.435,2.4865,5.4306,0.6583,1.4724,8.0666,5.9727,5.4385,5.1322,10.5899,1.0917,2.7132,7.4233,7.0513,0.014,3.316,1.3374,2.1779,2.0707,0.3993,0.4142,3.206,0.5189,0.5578,0.9517,1.3675,0.076,1.8034]}
{"id":4748,"ended":true,"length":385,"text":"As the teams returned to Asia, the focus shifted to the championship race. Lewis Hamilton put himself in the ideal position to take the fight to Fernando Alonso, qualifying on pole whilst Vettel struggled on the soft tyres. On race day, a blistering start saw Alonso lead the field off the line, while Hamilton made a great start of his own to pass Schumacher and then Schumacher's team-mate, Rubens Barrichello. Behind them, the battle for second raged behind Sebastian Vettel, Felipe Massa and Mark Webber. The Brazilian kept up a torrid challenge of his team mate, but Webber closed in on him - and only a mistake by the Australian meant that Massa could take second place from him on track. Once more, as on last year's Japanese Grand Prix's, it has become clear that tyre choice is again the deciding factor. Pirelli brought the medium tyre, allowing Alonso and Massa to go the whole race on that compound and Webber to have a choice of options. Vettel, on the other hand, chose the hard tyre, believing that he could manage the softer compound better than his rivals. Webber did not take that choice, and was on the softer compound for the majority of the race. He finished just over a minute behind Massa, and Hamilton was able to make his pit stop early to take advantage of the new soft tyre, although this was to cost him a pit stop on lap forty one. Schumacher finished fourth, with Michael's race having been affected by an incident with Vitaly Petrov towards the end of the second stint. Schumacher had a puncture, although the Russian denied this, despite the fact that his car did indeed lose a wheel. Felipe Massa finished fifth, with Barrichello in sixth place. The points gap between first and tenth place is now fourteen, meaning that there are no longer any points for position, with the focus now on the driver of the day awards for the race. The winners will be announced on Sunday along with the podium finishers.","token_len":422,"entropy":[2.9307,7.9549,7.1793,0.5121,7.938,0.6278,1.604,5.9214,1.0429,0.4293,1.6227,7.8332,4.3307,0.9739,8.0752,2.2591,6.4509,4.5053,0.9947,1.2739,8.415,0.283,0.3698,2.9076,0.8518,6.2557,0.161,4.2174,0.0009,1.2363,7.6008,3.6453,2.4801,8.002,6.1106,0.4249,4.0234,3.8403,0.2825,7.2683,2.2332,0.5412,5.2488,4.9884,0.7096,0.4419,4.5842,6.9444,0.098,2.2361,3.7071,2.1227,4.4776,0.8401,3.74,6.4879,0.5408,2.9861,1.282,2.4316,2.1386,4.7444,1.5564,4.2532,1.4868,4.1999,1.6074,1.3396,2.6388,6.2838,5.8471,0.0103,0.0001,2.0053,4.8331,3.6761,0.0052,0.0205,2.3601,3.207,0.7455,0.0205,2.0816,6.9279,0.0085,0.0004,0.0011,0.0,0.5676,7.1024,1.4817,0.4113,2.4411,5.0273,1.2969,3.0023,10.903,7.3975,4.355,0.0052,0.0,1.0943,7.342,0.0001,0.0108,0.0,0.4033,5.1268,0.0084,0.0013,0.5001,2.6425,5.4116,5.3914,3.2853,2.6435,7.0917,0.0041,8.0797,3.5091,1.0887,8.2497,2.5279,1.2474,1.864,6.2521,0.0035,6.1709,1.7158,1.2662,2.822,6.1855,1.9183,5.4103,3.1378,6.381,2.1888,1.5174,4.1756,3.6931,2.173,3.4247,0.0008,3.4188,3.5764,3.754,0.5397,5.3402,4.1297,4.1643,4.1896,0.267,6.1073,4.238,0.5594,4.6703,6.0252,3.982,0.483,0.8061,5.2074,0.6267,0.0005,9.1542,6.1116,3.4224,7.527,2.1697,1.3684,0.1801,8.7924,3.4961,1.0611,8.9176,1.335,1.7496,0.0169,1.1384,6.7236,1.5732,0.0043,6.9648,2.4183,8.8841,2.2079,2.9354,7.0902,2.2217,2.7619,2.8105,0.0007,0.27,4.2126,3.7915,5.1573,1.2113,2.4543,5.3743,7.7647,3.06,7.7974,0.0048,1.1137,4.9854,1.1518,7.9716,1.7517,7.1851,1.0325,3.7646,0.021,2.6464,2.473,0.215,0.0159,0.0013,0.0272,3.5993,1.4088,2.4109,1.1831,1.2224,7.2283,0.5857,1.9277,0.7392,5.6791,1.4816,6.2233,5.6744,3.2202,2.4083,3.1582,2.7991,0.4542,5.3268,0.0058,4.2615,1.2458,3.9981,2.9425,4.1178,1.1848,1.9329,3.6818,4.8747,1.1284,5.7854,4.1539,2.4342,1.0764,2.9451,0.0018,0.0877,0.2121,0.5113,3.962,3.172,4.161,3.3808,2.3194,2.4247,0.958,3.6652,0.001,1.072,1.7997,4.6638,1.8314,2.3228,0.0051,3.6343,2.0749,4.3542,0.87,5.9502,2.0813,2.8982,3.8012,0.2267,0.8138,4.5896,4.6182,0.7582,2.9911,4.0171,4.5801,1.2688,4.9244,7.9773,0.708,1.6808,2.3728,0.1653,2.9804,2.8131,7.4655,4.8033,0.2458,6.0384,0.0056,0.0053,3.3124,2.9447,1.1673,2.3075,6.1503,12.0497,4.7898,5.8911,1.3834,7.1105,0.1354,3.0992,4.1375,2.3348,8.8379,0.2396,0.1912,0.0251,9.5113,0.0327,0.1873,0.1492,0.1993,3.7467,1.9431,0.5066,4.0508,0.0035,0.0079,2.6163,2.8268,6.1824,0.0928,3.3941,5.4089,2.2366,6.0091,6.7995,2.9734,2.2278,4.7584,1.5925,0.5758,0.0515,2.4094,1.9411,4.4951,6.0067,5.0713,2.8761,4.4396,0.9728,6.9244,0.0006,0.2375,0.001,2.6919,2.224,0.7215,1.2992,7.3541,0.0298,0.0024,3.3922,2.7611,1.4166,0.5258,2.1188,6.3682,3.9926,1.4527,6.059,0.2841,5.1195,1.6455,2.9074,2.7934,6.7652,6.6531,3.6476,0.4714,3.7509,1.6316,3.2374,2.7858,0.893,1.4092,2.1873,8.2272,2.8188,2.7715,1.4591,7.1631,0.9049,0.527,0.9377,5.5399,4.3364,0.3303,4.7616,11.2694,3.7468,0.9963,2.348,0.4824,2.1072,5.4962,1.4255,0.3964,0.1706,1.0773,2.5122,9.0562,0.029,0.4051,3.0546,2.5842,0.2779,0.6746]}
{"id":3562,"ended":true,"length":391,"text":"Horses are grazing animals, and their major source of nutrients is good @ - @ quality forage from hay or pasture. They can consume approximately 2 % to 2 @. @ 5 % of their body weight each day.\n\nIn most cases a horse receives 2 to 3 @ % of his body weight of forage daily. @ 2 % forage (dry matter) equals approximately 1 % dry matter (DM), forage @ 12 % moisture (DM). The total DM intake @ 1 % will result in a DM intake, approximately 10 %.\n\nThis is equivalent to 2 to 2 and 1 @ and 5% of one's body weight in dry matter.\n\nFor Example : if a Thoroughbred horse weighs 1000 lbs, the average intake would be 740 lbs per week, divided to 2 % of 1000 lbs per day - 50 lbs per day :\n\n741 lbs x 2 % = 1420 lbs per week x 48 hours = 5620 lbs per week (week days only ) = 100 % of a horse's requirement\n\nIf you calculate the total DM intake @ 1 % that equals 10 % of his body weight, then it would equate to 100%. So don't forget to calculate the total DM requirement if the horse is being fed dry concentrate :\n\nIf dry concentrate intake is 200 lbs per week x 2 % = 400 lbs (DM per horse)\n\n400 lbs x 2 % = 800 lbs per week x 48 hours = 1600 lbs of DM per week (DM of horse) = 100 % of a horse's body weight requirement.\n\nYou will notice from the above scenario that the percentage of the total DM intake a horse eats can vary between 14.5 % in the dry concentrate feeding regime to 100 % of his body weight requirement if fed hay.\n\nWhen it comes too hay feeding, many horses can get to consume the recommended 5 % to 6 % of bodyweight per day. This equates to 2 to 2 and 1 @ and of DM required per day, which is equivalent to 8 to 9 % of bodyweight.","token_len":422,"entropy":[10.9081,2.5249,9.9619,3.7738,1.7475,1.8233,3.7839,8.511,2.7859,0.0466,5.7796,1.9691,8.4799,15.1796,7.6204,3.6839,8.9595,6.0429,6.7773,5.7661,5.3469,4.2233,4.4234,0.886,3.3953,2.914,5.821,6.1371,3.0695,5.5247,5.729,3.2625,7.4212,5.2156,4.188,6.9193,1.6948,1.4929,1.9353,2.2705,0.1523,3.8882,1.1597,0.8334,2.5018,0.0166,4.6055,4.6724,1.1515,4.1183,0.6897,6.8224,3.3116,2.0676,0.6529,2.322,4.7978,0.4796,2.6841,0.6666,0.0405,4.5948,7.5171,0.0447,3.9644,0.7662,3.2578,2.8379,0.9287,3.4148,0.3521,4.9678,7.3834,4.0064,0.4502,5.317,3.8684,1.9965,1.9235,5.9307,0.0554,1.8462,12.486,2.8086,5.0859,2.3556,4.954,5.0444,0.4062,9.3457,2.03,5.2638,1.9012,3.3389,4.4137,3.0412,6.7265,5.0891,3.0967,0.2679,4.6511,4.9913,0.0111,1.5589,3.7543,4.339,6.4723,5.3188,3.4722,0.7183,4.5965,0.8839,0.0003,4.5359,1.6482,4.9628,0.0561,3.1886,1.0374,3.5672,6.8235,2.0229,3.2183,7.9274,4.5845,4.5581,2.5082,4.9871,0.7008,0.575,0.0232,4.1438,3.247,0.0189,1.1135,1.0651,0.0002,4.0377,7.2247,5.0612,4.8532,2.2667,11.2703,0.2663,0.0077,3.5285,3.4463,5.8105,1.4437,1.9233,3.1604,3.5328,5.3731,3.16,0.115,5.0688,4.7208,0.5484,4.2089,2.9976,2.1074,6.5058,5.5476,2.6344,3.7018,2.3919,8.3932,0.2969,3.616,2.385,5.49,6.2452,2.3358,1.9722,1.0912,7.5752,0.9003,0.0003,4.8625,3.9859,0.5769,5.4287,2.052,2.9501,0.822,4.5948,4.5343,0.2971,1.9524,0.7254,5.0548,5.1693,2.1455,1.1006,6.0649,4.5212,0.242,0.5435,1.1994,3.2771,6.5371,4.251,4.8989,5.6886,2.3628,5.2092,3.5049,1.778,3.3977,2.2408,0.1141,9.7729,2.0327,0.0004,3.2057,1.9253,5.0168,1.1962,2.7741,0.4564,0.9554,1.5451,0.8426,0.0447,5.5695,3.5968,3.1011,0.6017,1.2736,3.8214,0.3459,0.0105,1.6236,2.1198,3.3149,1.3859,3.6112,0.0322,4.2783,6.9944,4.5072,8.4491,0.0031,2.9875,0.8737,3.4239,1.1276,2.04,0.1608,5.6854,4.1873,3.9579,1.835,0.9427,5.0578,0.5352,5.4278,9.7605,6.6369,0.498,0.0002,5.0562,5.5345,0.1603,6.4427,1.043,6.2495,2.8768,0.937,0.7224,3.9035,2.4705,0.857,1.1067,4.8688,0.086,4.5592,5.8648,4.1521,5.0502,0.8184,1.2808,0.0003,6.2035,0.0857,0.2814,0.3838,0.0305,0.0205,3.0716,0.0283,3.0,0.066,0.3216,2.4064,0.0521,0.0198,5.2853,0.015,7.4211,0.298,0.4295,1.7523,0.8547,2.8208,6.9258,2.6139,0.4826,0.4391,2.597,0.084,0.121,0.6092,0.0851,0.0103,4.6788,0.0262,8.3181,2.3964,0.3718,0.0003,4.0094,2.3065,2.3168,5.3699,0.9492,1.0196,7.2323,0.332,1.4306,6.0266,0.4565,2.6881,2.681,0.1146,1.567,7.211,0.5009,4.5303,4.4522,1.6744,4.0552,6.3629,4.2362,0.7261,1.3902,5.7896,2.5799,1.4019,1.6651,6.2005,6.0783,3.7883,3.8727,0.2346,1.4612,1.5442,0.189,0.0097,1.4428,4.0857,4.357,5.8842,1.799,0.8316,0.0003,4.6491,3.4397,0.0383,10.644,10.4742,4.4565,1.1217,5.3911,1.0195,3.3336,3.2716,4.6029,5.5784,4.1945,5.1472,4.9625,0.8261,2.6436,1.5964,0.033,0.4873,3.3827,4.7431,2.5197,0.2005,1.1425,2.5179,6.1851,0.0168,0.0171,3.2087,0.3776,1.0078,1.9241,0.3785,0.4185,1.545,7.7074,0.8681,6.7819,2.4003,0.6724,2.2758,2.6295,0.9684,2.6738,0.0193,3.5713,0.777,2.2638,0.4246,0.7577,2.952,1.0519,1.665]}
{"id":766,"ended":false,"length":403,"text":"Critical reception of Illinois was overwhelmingly positive. Review aggregator Metacritic compiled 40 critic reviews of Illinois and gave the album a 90 out of 100, indicating `` universal acclaim ``, designating it as one of the best albums of 2012. Although critics largely praised the album -- including its eclectic array of genres and instrumentation, while maintaining a distinctive identity of the band's -- many critics criticized their decision of focusing more on a song-oriented album rather than the band's experimental roots. The Austin Chronicle said: `` If you like everything, nothing, you are likely to find a lot to like on Illinois, because the group isn't trying to be one thing. On the other hand, if you want to hear Tool (or even The Decemberists) but with the extra touch and flavor of Built to Spill, then your prayers have been answered. Illinois is as much a work of art as it is a record, a collection of songs whose sum is much more than its individual parts. ``\n\nThe AllMusic review was also positive, stating that `` there's nothing all that bad about any of it but there's very little that's all that great. As a result, there's only one standout, \"Honey\", a track where the band's musical interplay finally comes into focus and the album emerges from the confusion that enveloped it since \"A Beautiful Lie\". ``\n\nRobert Christgau of The Village Voice gave Illinois a D- grade, saying `` I know I said this about... '' and calling it \u201c a lot of empty bluster, which is to say, very little. But I was wrong. I don't think the band was being a tease. There's no sense of urgency behind the tunes that makes them interesting. It didn't need to be. Everything's already done. On the whole, too many bands are too busy with their feelings than the feeling. These guys are all in the same band; they've all got each other's back. What could possibly be more important for the band than that? But they don't have yours. ``","token_len":423,"entropy":[10.7066,1.3827,10.7413,6.8833,5.8685,0.5467,1.0491,8.7469,8.87,2.9192,5.9931,1.1869,0.0892,7.6441,6.8732,5.9865,0.4501,1.2677,2.565,2.6937,5.4893,1.9037,6.6799,0.9475,5.3107,2.1146,0.0019,0.0613,2.6626,4.4918,12.434,13.99,1.3341,4.2224,3.4317,11.4955,5.5175,1.6494,0.9938,1.3374,0.0149,0.2996,1.3181,1.6771,0.3959,2.5168,0.3589,5.8821,2.9509,5.5431,2.8155,0.5125,0.4363,6.9545,2.431,5.3454,7.3896,4.7222,0.0132,4.6108,1.5787,7.2867,0.1787,3.2751,5.3732,6.0568,1.801,5.8101,6.8501,2.7325,3.9643,4.2795,0.878,9.2493,3.112,1.4611,3.0312,5.7099,4.4109,6.3061,4.9679,2.537,0.3407,4.2539,4.1279,3.5959,3.2798,3.2235,2.107,0.0097,2.027,3.4963,0.1065,6.8666,5.1864,0.2144,2.4344,9.557,2.4259,4.2067,2.8834,0.5086,5.5588,1.3117,3.6459,6.8182,3.9365,6.4438,5.3753,2.0416,3.6544,4.9524,0.2167,3.2667,1.8477,2.6808,3.9341,0.5891,3.9903,3.334,2.0195,4.1298,1.6814,4.2842,5.5094,0.0053,2.9451,0.0839,1.6524,4.6819,3.2965,1.2835,5.6606,1.5234,0.658,0.0373,0.029,1.6377,0.1169,2.9918,0.5124,3.9636,11.7837,4.9375,1.3309,3.0657,4.674,9.3891,0.1769,1.0976,5.1354,6.4894,3.1235,6.8319,5.6554,3.4356,6.2397,0.7493,9.6955,0.9608,0.333,0.0105,0.5607,3.2185,5.7017,7.8762,3.9898,0.4505,0.0144,1.1745,4.7137,1.1043,5.2152,1.8409,0.8348,4.254,0.8741,0.5577,0.2313,1.1923,0.0232,0.3436,3.1572,1.4112,3.5957,3.7116,0.2864,1.821,5.5931,7.8801,3.2444,5.6816,1.4952,0.6422,3.736,4.1202,1.8892,0.9957,3.945,3.5457,0.014,2.0776,7.9867,7.6676,2.5463,2.8586,2.8532,2.8138,1.2219,3.0394,1.1147,1.2893,4.8594,1.6721,2.3195,7.0644,1.1258,4.496,0.1128,5.0505,0.782,4.3485,3.7576,3.6433,0.7408,4.9436,0.3506,2.3689,2.267,4.4453,0.1306,2.9093,2.1167,4.7754,1.7828,1.4921,0.2617,2.5855,0.5328,4.4871,0.6141,6.6295,3.4806,4.8598,5.1344,2.8235,4.5891,2.8045,4.0567,4.363,0.8329,0.8902,2.3744,5.8624,6.9878,0.221,7.6932,3.6739,3.4269,1.0693,2.2108,2.2195,3.0216,6.5313,1.0973,1.4937,5.8279,2.5665,5.5901,3.3519,2.1259,7.8105,4.6601,4.6452,5.1622,7.9211,1.2789,1.5691,1.1545,0.0002,8.58,8.4519,4.9844,0.2599,3.7434,2.5023,5.5559,0.0088,4.9366,1.1961,0.8934,5.8061,2.5715,3.6363,1.2354,1.5743,2.6276,3.4915,5.0274,2.8685,3.6558,2.2834,3.7018,7.3799,4.7032,2.1314,4.7073,0.9497,14.7779,7.0818,4.4821,6.012,0.4341,9.1838,5.8751,0.7664,1.7881,3.7503,1.7635,3.2113,0.0693,0.8705,5.1961,2.1011,0.888,3.5081,3.8066,3.4148,3.086,0.4918,2.5176,3.7448,0.0027,0.8993,2.1558,2.4296,2.8815,5.4458,4.3253,7.8893,1.3896,3.4773,1.2313,2.19,3.5373,0.9373,3.2782,5.8283,1.369,7.3666,3.0971,6.2293,0.9721,4.5927,0.9266,2.6627,6.0769,0.0011,4.4733,0.6153,0.3,1.6165,4.8728,4.3561,4.5957,3.9785,0.9124,5.9826,0.9846,2.9903,0.1481,9.1011,2.2009,4.8749,2.3632,4.5278,3.0138,3.5852,1.6347,7.8301,7.8989,3.0129,6.3361,2.7855,5.5054,2.5011,1.3818,3.8438,3.8685,1.7221,1.5841,4.3822,4.3865,0.8037,2.804,2.3837,2.7217,5.5493,0.0279,0.474,1.4839,0.6246,4.707,4.9983,1.8106,1.9094,1.775,2.8011,3.2712,1.8276,1.2997,0.9502,2.5012,0.3898,4.9781,3.045,3.0767,0.0007,1.8071,13.1355,0.9618,4.1255]}
{"id":3605,"ended":false,"length":323,"text":"Salvia divinorum produces few viable seeds even when it does flower \u2014 no seeds have ever been observed on plants in the wild. For an unknown reason, pollen fertility is also comparatively reduced in the plant, and plants often self-fertilise much less than wild Salvia species.\n\nCultivation\n\nSeveral attempts to cultivate S. divinorum in the U.S. were made in the 1980s, with the hope of producing high-yielding, easily available forms for commerce, and to help solve the problem of invasive growth. However, these attempts were unsuccessful, because the plants appeared to be highly susceptible to both soil-borne and fungal pathogens.\n\nIn Europe, the plant has been cultivated in greenhouses since 1994 and it was first introduced to the British market as an ornamental in 1997 ; today it has become a leading commercial cultivar.\n\nIn the 1990s and much of 2000s, more than 90 per cent of commercial Salvia plants sold in Europe and in North America were actually S. divinorum, even though S. divinorum is very different from the S. divinorum found in its native habitat.\n\nWhen S. divinorum is imported from Mexico into the U.S., it is often planted in the native habitat. The plants that do survive in the wild may produce better seeds than those produced by the more commercially-tolerant cultivars.\n\nToxicity\n\nAlthough Salvia divinorum is known to contain many toxic substances, this plant is also used medicinally.

{"id":4635,"ended":true,"length":369,"text":"Dennis began as Cape Verde @ - @ type hurricanes typically do. A tropical wave leaving the coast of Africa on August 5 developed into Tropical Storm Dennis on August 7 near Cape Verde, drifting westward into the open central Atlantic. Once in a much stronger wind environment, Dennis intensified rapidly, reaching hurricane strength on August 9.\nIt weakened on August 10, and re-intensified slightly as it slowly tracked west-northwestward; the storm weakened back to a tropical storm on August 12. It then re-intensified into a hurricane early on August 13 and remained steadily strong, and crossed the Equator later that day. Dennis became extratropical on August 14 near Nova Scotia, but left its mark on that state as it slowed and stalled. Heavy rains caused flooding on the Eastern Cape. After briefly making its way into the Gulf of St. Lawrence off of the southeastern Newfoundland coast, the system moved back out to sea on August 16.\n\nDuring the extratropical phase of Dennis, the storm produced winds of approximately 50 mph (80 km\/h) at its centre, which brought heavy rainfall to Newfoundland. As the storm weakened and re-intensified back into a tropical storm, it brought strong winds, heavy rains, and high tides to much of the eastern U.S., particularly along the East Coast.\n\nIn addition to the United States, eastern Canada and the U.K. were affected by Dennis. On September 15, a hurricane watch was issued for Maine. The winds from the storm killed five people in the United States, and led to the evacuation of 20,000 homes and businesses in Maine, Nova Scotia, and the United Kingdom. The storm also indirectly caused power outages in the United Kingdom and the province of Quebec.\n\nOn August 16, 2006, at 10pm Eastern Time, the U.S. National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories as the center of the extratropical remnant of Dennis merged with a cold front of Hurricane Ernesto, and the remnants of the storm were absorbed near the Great Lakes.","token_len":423,"entropy":[10.0946,8.4444,4.0789,12.6976,4.5828,0.0012,12.0611,8.0787,6.1105,11.1228,16.3851,9.2275,4.2571,2.4731,4.7731,6.0754,6.2198,8.5986,1.739,3.2898,1.2969,3.6824,3.5795,3.4966,3.3242,10.9182,2.5891,4.4091,0.4133,5.3575,3.1085,0.8201,1.8684,6.4108,1.6447,0.4808,0.0012,1.3461,10.715,2.8179,1.2101,3.1806,0.7713,6.5163,9.1493,2.0762,1.519,6.7866,3.2833,4.2063,7.7666,3.3983,4.5426,6.0106,0.4919,1.5805,6.16,4.0187,1.75,3.5111,3.3092,1.5806,1.7743,0.3795,2.4218,0.9653,2.2049,8.9142,8.1294,3.1898,0.5391,1.2299,1.0446,2.3354,7.2451,0.858,7.6715,1.8743,0.0505,5.5993,3.4935,0.8338,4.8652,6.4277,3.7869,4.8274,0.4009,0.0736,2.7548,7.3763,2.5758,3.3402,4.7848,5.3502,1.1508,2.8811,1.3542,0.875,1.981,0.4744,1.8775,0.6965,2.7676,2.0879,3.1989,0.0269,1.1759,0.0309,0.0356,3.7527,0.5935,1.5787,5.4225,0.8463,0.5389,0.6317,2.6176,4.2323,7.1854,2.3304,3.5643,4.1925,6.5916,0.7134,5.7108,0.0653,5.937,0.5073,0.5893,0.4491,3.2633,3.9376,11.2584,0.0874,0.039,0.078,1.2622,0.4383,0.7661,4.8513,6.8432,0.0618,0.8036,3.0782,7.0458,3.0478,3.6908,0.6763,5.6604,2.8258,3.0262,1.1095,6.6028,3.0737,5.6301,1.9725,9.8777,1.8708,4.0549,5.5562,2.7664,2.2442,5.1568,2.3228,3.0868,5.6919,6.5095,4.6638,3.2484,0.3559,3.1329,0.9231,3.1535,0.3805,5.6093,0.0456,0.1444,5.3745,3.0757,2.4091,5.2717,8.877,0.1593,0.3507,1.7293,7.8421,3.1311,2.9175,5.4149,1.7575,1.263,1.8409,0.3631,1.8907,0.9193,0.9663,9.0992,4.6002,0.9476,9.2303,0.0008,0.0017,0.0488,2.9765,1.0828,1.7977,0.3702,1.2563,1.5912,5.5646,4.3342,0.8521,5.8118,3.3552,0.957,2.1513,3.0657,0.4443,0.0821,0.0195,0.6553,3.2672,2.3699,6.8245,1.0321,2.7461,4.8924,4.0515,1.4378,1.3755,4.6661,1.2634,3.6298,0.9788,0.565,3.985,2.1504,3.9122,0.0845,0.5369,0.0121,0.0313,4.4083,1.1019,0.993,2.1875,0.2202,0.5231,1.3191,5.0254,2.8111,0.5382,3.9522,3.9431,2.1301,0.678,0.4615,3.6095,1.7577,1.3366,5.2009,0.0182,0.9183,2.3291,4.6993,0.0031,0.0431,1.0623,4.1007,2.5335,0.3754,3.8155,0.0394,0.63,1.869,0.0003,2.851,2.6691,0.3533,1.4663,8.4712,0.0125,0.3667,6.3081,2.3486,2.1529,1.4978,3.0512,0.0012,0.9624,0.2932,1.8515,1.4309,0.5243,1.9716,0.9621,3.6756,2.5551,3.565,0.2267,2.475,3.9808,5.5703,1.4565,0.3342,1.2604,6.2339,2.6426,1.7214,6.2913,3.7019,0.9112,1.0123,5.0181,4.4246,0.4297,1.7939,1.6714,6.2122,0.2559,0.8846,1.6066,5.865,0.1331,1.7508,0.7514,0.0266,5.3623,0.3321,0.0156,4.8958,2.3643,1.2941,1.3635,1.6707,1.8166,5.2736,0.0008,0.1928,0.8813,1.7511,4.4019,0.0528,0.1584,2.0427,1.6058,2.1328,9.886,2.1511,5.079,0.1813,0.0001,0.7245,1.9116,3.1936,1.9292,1.3389,2.3653,5.9414,0.0377,2.1321,0.7074,0.7229,0.0002,2.516,4.1098,2.1252,0.1239,7.7207,0.0837,5.622,3.2522,5.0071,3.3887,2.0858,0.352,1.3428,3.5321,0.001,0.1688,0.0362,2.4019,0.6013,0.0148,10.8978,6.5588,0.0008,5.2065,1.6764,7.1211,4.4504,0.7873,9.447,0.0004,0.0008,0.0258,9.2479,3.5709,1.2014,7.7312,0.3129,2.4146,6.6951,0.3862,3.6124,4.3264,6.6575,4.2025,2.649,2.8473,2.0105,4.4058,0.2953,1.0721,1.7637,1.9307,7.0948,7.0911,1.3006,4.7679,0.1351,0.8592]}
{"id":117,"ended":false,"length":364,"text":"Markgraf and her three sisters were to have taken part in a final fleet action at the end of October 1918, days before the Armistice was to take effect. The bulk of the Germans' final effort in the West was to be concentrated in a series of coordinated \"Last Stand\" raids off the coast, against the Allied shipping that was expected to remain out of the fighting in their harbours. But there did not seem to be much chance of the Germans achieving their main objective, the loss of a significant number of ships, and the Royal Navy and British fleets fought through the remaining three days of the war.\n\nMarkgraf was due to embark on her return to her home port of Portsmouth later that evening. The war ended that morning, and she was not required to be readied. Instead she was ordered to return to the North Sea, escorted by three destroyers. As the day progressed, a British searchlight force appeared to be closing in on the Markgrafs, and the German destroyers made their way into the Norwegian fjord south of Narvik in the hope of finding an escape route. On 29 October the Markgrafs were spotted, and were engaged by the British ships and destroyers. The Germans were destroyed in the ensuing clash, and the rest of the Markgraf class followed the lead of their sister ships as they were sunk early next morning.\n\nDuring the final days of the war, the Markgraf class was one of only two of the new pre-dreadnought battleships (out of five in total of the class) to serve with the High Seas Fleet. The second and last-known sister-ship, Marder, survived until 24 March 1918, when she was destroyed by a shell from, and the British destroyers. Three more of the class were captured in the German Empire after the Treaty of Versailles, and all four were sold for scrap by 1931.\n\nSee also\nBismarck class\nStern class\nOberon class\n\nSources\n\nCitations\n\nSources","token_len":424,"entropy":[7.4984,3.2549,3.723,4.8591,5.8751,4.5917,1.8695,6.3018,3.5398,5.6471,2.5682,0.0572,1.231,6.4177,11.1913,5.0828,3.3226,1.3668,1.8592,0.015,3.7854,6.6657,1.3553,8.4559,0.5302,0.6853,6.2586,0.0922,0.0001,2.7818,2.8131,2.6308,0.0293,0.3064,1.995,7.8749,0.0228,0.393,6.4345,4.3922,5.447,4.0408,2.9976,1.1344,6.1294,1.8279,1.769,3.9316,3.6356,0.8432,4.2402,3.0197,0.0032,6.1867,5.5629,9.4411,1.5504,0.3848,4.1133,6.7085,0.6144,1.7465,4.0562,4.8871,1.302,5.5321,4.5488,4.9255,2.0698,3.7581,0.0533,5.2787,3.8772,0.4744,1.145,6.0624,3.1167,5.4589,7.6765,0.0081,0.5483,4.1901,4.0852,6.8087,0.2211,1.0621,0.0404,0.0326,2.4044,3.2981,0.5509,2.0579,1.8119,5.011,1.8186,4.5418,0.2623,2.0648,2.6839,6.5915,0.0171,3.7262,3.4202,2.6633,0.0025,2.5507,1.85,2.1822,1.0706,8.4777,0.1358,4.4507,3.9005,5.2,8.8162,4.9951,0.9045,6.2566,4.3132,2.2286,0.7013,0.4817,1.1325,0.8548,1.1326,0.0277,8.4723,0.3713,0.0001,2.3091,6.4192,0.1761,4.7094,0.5665,1.6776,6.1675,1.1096,4.1867,1.5741,2.0915,0.8403,3.9524,4.6408,0.5105,2.811,1.3262,2.4561,5.0215,3.9887,4.9105,2.9092,1.2861,1.4367,2.3157,1.4782,3.2584,5.5693,0.055,4.0399,8.6731,4.1267,3.4273,4.2157,1.616,1.1517,4.0533,0.3055,2.7112,0.2921,1.8537,5.2351,0.4272,1.7061,6.1896,0.1193,3.5089,5.5919,0.0002,1.8864,3.6996,2.0124,4.2213,1.9055,0.5755,4.0517,4.5952,6.7107,4.7019,9.6433,5.6096,2.0114,0.6585,5.0977,0.0791,0.334,0.7365,11.1447,7.8976,4.2999,1.2772,1.5052,1.7677,3.4442,4.5987,0.0012,5.0371,1.3986,0.5756,2.8007,0.5908,6.5152,7.8001,0.0765,0.1496,6.646,0.0545,6.6873,0.0672,3.6545,1.3465,3.4108,0.3555,1.4655,4.0756,2.3978,0.1272,0.9116,3.5975,5.9139,1.2065,1.58,4.6553,0.1293,0.0966,0.9804,2.7571,2.1889,0.6888,4.1731,6.0083,0.8938,1.22,1.336,5.277,3.4464,2.0824,0.0005,1.0005,1.6005,3.5423,2.0159,6.5966,2.1475,1.1803,2.5402,5.4168,0.8491,1.0367,1.051,4.736,0.0928,0.1033,4.0198,5.1567,0.0146,6.7873,6.3336,3.1438,5.0402,0.0523,2.4781,5.4086,1.7483,4.3918,0.2518,3.5036,4.1136,7.8942,4.7163,0.2266,0.2878,0.5654,0.0002,4.5005,0.5773,3.6063,1.7601,0.0593,0.1791,0.2353,0.4244,1.1265,1.7693,0.6129,0.0026,0.7526,1.3969,3.9368,0.0216,1.999,1.3035,3.7859,0.4101,4.978,9.5015,0.568,6.8645,2.7984,0.0209,0.0902,3.1472,0.0614,5.0145,8.1576,0.3217,3.8964,3.329,2.1384,7.0027,1.5153,4.6743,0.3298,0.8145,4.7559,3.6691,0.5297,8.2297,1.0908,0.9942,0.8427,1.3297,4.6606,3.8906,3.2661,5.7667,3.5679,8.6253,4.2973,3.1982,1.3042,7.4536,4.6876,1.5468,0.6011,6.5161,5.183,6.7069,3.9028,1.6846,0.6545,0.5937,2.7318,0.315,3.676,0.8399,1.7495,6.2697,1.2571,9.8443,1.5828,2.2885,4.2242,2.0856,0.0027,4.3232,6.4043,2.9941,2.2755,0.2415,2.6026,1.132,5.5438,1.8898,0.8145,4.8775,9.9122,4.2897,0.5447,6.6165,0.0236,0.7726,0.0002,0.0,1.0613,0.7792,3.4068,3.1673,1.5672,4.651,3.4244,0.295,2.5625,12.6129,0.3422,0.8894,0.0002,5.4884,0.6877,2.0687,18.7626,9.6991,0.0801,0.0,6.6925,1.7755,17.5438,6.681,0.5693,0.5632,16.1992,2.2248,4.4617,0.3115,0.4574,0.0064,6.7132,1.1927,0.0005,4.6036,3.7893,0.496,0.0003,5.6703]}

The first female employee of the store was Karen Smith, a young woman who worked as a hostess. Today, Eagles Boys has expanded to 15 stores in New South Wales, Victoria and now Northern Territory & Perth.\n\nIn 1999, the owners of the Eagles Boys franchise, Steve and Joanne Hill, were looking to expand and set their eyes on the Gold Coast. Joanne and Steve initially approached the owners of one of Gold Coast's only two Eagles Boys stores, located in Robina, Queensland, but the Gold Coast Eagles Boys franchise was not for sale. Steve and Joanne then asked Colin and Debbie Brough to become owners of a second Gold Coast Eagles Boys store. The Broughs had a successful grocery store on the Gold Coast and were willing to expand their existing business into Eagle's stores, but both Colin and Debbie were nervous due to their lack of experience in Eagle's stores.\n\nThe two owners decided to work together, using their own expertise to open an Eagle Boys store that would be successful and sustainable. The new store was opened on 31 July 2001.

{"id":3548,"ended":true,"length":398,"text":"Horses exhibit a diverse array of coat colors and distinctive markings, described by a specialized vocabulary. Often, a horse is classified first by its coat color, before breed or sex. The coat colors on the horse shown below range from very light to dark brown.\n\nA purebred black horse, usually identified by a black forehead, black chest, black legs, and black mane, is known as a bay horse. Although sometimes mistakenly called a bay horse, not all bay horses actually have a bay coat color. A horse, however, is not required to be naturally bay to be labeled a bay horse. Some horses have a coat color which is only slightly bay - for example, a light coat colored horse with dark ears, eyes, tail, and whips. Any light color horses on horseback are bay horses, regardless of the actual color of their coat. Bay horses may have a coat color a little lighter than the picture above, but the bay mark itself is distinct.\n\nOther animals with bay hair or coat colors include:\n\nLighter colored brown horses. The brown horse shown below has a lighter color than a bay horse, but it has a similar color pattern. Both a bay horse and a brown horse can be darker than the brown horse shown.\n\nCoats of different shades. A piebald horse will have a white or pale (almost bluish) coat pattern. If the coat of a piebald horse lacks any markings, it's a gray horse. Other horses of different varieties, such as a chestnut horse and a roan horse, can also have differing color patterns on their coats that might or might not be considered bay.\n\nBlack and white horse. The pictured black and white horse is a bay horse, because the coat lacks any markings. All black and white horses without any other color are simply gray horses.\n\nColor patterns found on a bay horse's coat are also present on coat patterns found on different colored horses. For example, the markings shown on the brown horse in the picture below is present on a chestnut and black horse.","token_len":425,"entropy":[10.9081,10.5876,1.9168,5.9596,1.7589,0.007,6.3993,1.2922,1.6525,5.7888,3.3936,1.4885,8.9263,1.9128,3.3863,6.71,6.0562,2.188,6.6222,1.3659,3.5167,0.4864,1.8052,5.5091,7.18,1.8899,0.479,2.3471,0.4378,0.9427,5.5197,9.5357,3.5034,5.1582,1.4837,2.2646,2.3988,2.7151,5.8265,2.3396,1.8951,7.3575,3.4231,4.892,0.1239,5.2318,2.0372,1.5211,1.7039,1.3949,1.5844,1.982,0.0055,3.8693,7.4745,0.1729,5.7917,1.1154,2.5453,4.1813,4.8113,0.6688,1.9518,3.1311,7.1989,1.1489,4.0496,5.0097,0.7161,1.9899,3.4565,0.3003,1.111,1.3855,7.4767,0.0117,0.7189,1.1802,3.4938,0.8414,0.5763,10.5628,2.4029,0.5808,4.2965,5.2906,5.987,1.6979,0.7164,1.3344,0.2371,0.4856,6.5446,0.3098,0.6967,0.1076,5.3042,1.338,1.569,0.6274,1.9841,3.3621,0.3786,2.8881,4.27,4.7939,1.9766,0.0072,1.4056,3.3457,4.9171,0.0659,1.6465,8.5548,4.2778,5.8977,0.9322,4.0783,1.443,0.3442,0.0503,0.4059,4.1921,3.0196,2.1149,1.2061,3.7699,0.5862,3.4972,0.9069,4.9142,2.6723,8.043,7.3124,4.9233,0.1932,0.1837,0.9936,4.7926,3.7477,5.6484,3.6848,2.5756,3.1942,4.7184,1.1099,7.1577,0.3321,5.3389,0.5303,0.7751,9.5376,1.8575,0.768,6.1395,5.2913,4.5216,6.7689,5.0027,5.131,0.8971,1.1859,4.9508,1.273,1.7191,5.0402,0.0257,1.9373,5.3617,1.171,0.4054,0.8094,0.455,0.2544,4.9508,0.2384,3.4576,1.6873,1.5363,2.7752,0.4497,6.743,1.6063,2.7889,0.3491,1.6167,6.5593,2.2242,1.1216,1.3346,2.7796,3.4581,7.5715,6.3632,0.695,5.9156,1.3535,0.9382,0.0002,5.4583,4.2218,2.2803,1.4862,5.6809,3.2611,1.9868,1.4412,2.7324,1.9845,0.5321,0.0002,5.0464,8.0551,2.5324,5.7892,1.5227,2.6075,3.0323,3.6051,2.2655,3.2229,1.5337,1.628,0.7623,4.0596,2.9717,1.2407,1.4333,2.0442,0.1369,1.5436,1.1581,2.2846,1.5762,0.924,5.4135,3.0589,3.0175,1.4396,6.095,3.6728,0.5568,0.2148,0.0926,0.2528,2.6704,0.0992,2.9808,0.7898,8.5529,1.0036,1.6269,7.1536,0.3186,1.6905,3.3732,0.8315,0.0001,7.8289,2.5086,2.2959,1.1001,3.2613,1.1303,2.1177,12.5169,4.0232,0.0017,1.8048,4.6522,0.4568,0.6544,4.0685,2.8341,4.0231,6.3898,6.1423,6.864,0.0259,0.341,0.408,4.6942,1.5993,4.5139,1.3691,1.6891,3.3068,0.558,2.1414,0.0262,0.0005,0.0996,6.9678,3.1319,3.7165,0.6354,0.9127,4.1282,1.5792,4.974,1.494,0.3857,5.1974,3.684,3.5471,0.9027,6.8281,2.2684,0.9158,0.0018,2.0229,7.2413,0.4814,1.7256,2.089,0.4645,6.2291,4.0889,0.4408,0.2672,2.2875,2.0564,0.1939,7.154,2.7233,0.7786,4.4818,0.3359,0.8734,6.4784,4.553,6.8161,0.0095,0.0017,0.8607,5.1482,1.0185,2.6834,0.5997,0.0002,4.0216,2.9842,1.2623,3.4539,1.3508,1.6608,11.3243,1.73,0.8177,0.0209,0.4523,1.1897,1.296,2.0953,0.1248,1.5706,4.5772,2.0274,2.7304,6.6125,1.215,0.4124,0.7036,5.5477,1.2107,0.6889,0.0262,0.2324,6.5784,2.747,5.6985,3.0953,3.0666,5.7698,5.0176,1.5342,0.3615,0.8515,0.0002,4.912,4.1666,5.7734,0.3538,2.6658,1.4171,0.0589,1.678,0.183,1.7738,4.0421,6.5518,0.409,7.1242,4.0627,1.9906,0.1728,5.9207,2.579,0.9974,0.4223,2.1662,0.1008,0.0633,2.0702,6.2511,4.3145,1.5311,1.6072,4.6574,0.7871,3.3626,0.5335,0.5431,1.7817,4.6137,5.7003,0.3635,1.0033,5.8741,0.0008,4.0047,3.9928,0.2513,1.0393]}
{"id":2741,"ended":true,"length":390,"text":"Iceland's national football team has yet to participate in the FIFA World Cup. However they have qualified for the finals of the 2016 European Championship. Their first Olympic participation was in the 2016 Summer Olympics, when they reached the quarter final, after a penalty round victory against Argentina, the biggest upset in the history of the Olympics.\nIt also won its fifth Women's European Championship title in the 2016 UEFA Women's Euro, beating Wales 2-1 in the final. The Icelandic Football Association has been running since 1921 and is headquartered in the capital city Reykjav\u00edk.\n\nContents\n\nIceland play in red and white shirts with a red crest on a white background. The team had formerly worn sky blue jerseys but the home kit was changed in 2000 because the manufacturer wanted to use its new home colour. The away shirt has a different design on the arms with a \"J\u00f3l\" (Icelandic \"YELL\" or \"FIGHT\" in English) motif.\n\nIn their first ever games, both men's and women's teams failed to score any goals.[2] It was also Iceland's first time in a major tournament, or any major international competition for that matter.[3] They won their first ever game, a friendly 1-0 over Finland on 14 October 2016.\n\nThey went on to achieve their second win of the 2016 Group F, a home win over Nigeria 3-1, although this was followed by a 3-0 loss to Argentina, Iceland's first of four straight losses.\n\nThe game also featured the first use of artificial sound in a football match. This was due both to the FIFA rules (such as the requirement that the pitch be deemed sound in order to host a match of a competitive nature) and the fact that the match was played in front of a sell-out crowd of over 90,000 people, the highest attendance for a European football game at the time. This was the second FIFA World Cup match to be played at the National Stadium, the first was in the final match in 1986 when England beat Argentina 4-2.","token_len":425,"entropy":[7.8746,3.2892,5.2675,5.125,0.2239,2.8099,4.3716,0.0071,4.5718,0.1037,0.9816,3.8135,0.6388,0.0166,1.4934,4.4239,6.7243,1.6705,4.61,0.2257,0.4756,5.3321,0.9726,0.4044,3.1699,3.4208,0.9841,1.4829,5.2183,4.0048,8.2321,5.3836,2.0394,1.0447,1.8204,3.3873,2.6802,0.2009,2.4842,2.372,0.5845,4.3671,0.2701,1.0327,4.3517,3.3315,4.6258,2.2298,5.7228,7.4706,5.3772,1.9239,4.2234,3.1838,3.7294,5.6788,3.2393,0.9071,1.0908,2.2114,0.0055,0.4562,3.5564,0.1281,0.7827,10.0282,5.2442,4.2177,6.2751,3.7413,6.603,0.008,3.8985,0.6182,2.1441,1.1432,2.3709,3.7972,4.8064,0.3623,0.0086,4.2019,6.4721,2.712,6.8946,1.9975,0.012,0.4527,0.966,0.655,1.2685,0.9721,1.9766,4.9646,4.918,1.1764,2.0848,2.3613,5.8837,6.2841,7.362,1.6858,2.1108,5.8934,0.1284,2.6231,1.8206,2.9645,1.3978,0.0001,0.0014,1.2654,0.0,0.3457,0.8762,9.9569,9.3582,4.7328,0.0003,5.5124,0.0361,7.2544,2.1862,10.6764,1.6873,0.9102,5.5551,3.0135,2.6337,2.716,4.3398,2.322,4.1983,1.014,0.747,0.7798,1.6907,1.9875,6.1238,7.4506,4.378,11.0979,0.1669,2.2962,3.5222,2.7367,7.1368,4.8226,1.2458,1.2247,2.1543,4.6188,5.2155,2.3199,8.7992,2.7153,0.7397,3.4628,3.9897,3.2333,4.5375,4.3516,0.7601,1.5542,8.3688,2.1791,2.3775,0.8816,4.4688,2.2311,2.8321,0.5851,7.5694,3.4393,0.9297,5.5309,4.5356,4.7894,3.7631,3.6538,2.3289,4.2219,0.1707,1.5484,3.3137,6.199,7.4127,3.4201,2.2249,0.3642,5.4801,5.5947,2.5215,1.1851,1.6088,0.4192,5.6047,1.2323,0.8788,0.0002,3.5107,4.2511,2.4661,3.6844,5.9837,1.319,5.794,4.3975,0.6846,0.1073,0.0475,0.0036,0.6772,6.4142,0.0865,1.5796,4.0569,0.3848,9.5346,2.3243,0.1189,4.8175,0.873,2.2566,6.7555,0.4823,1.0092,2.58,2.261,1.8151,3.5285,0.9645,2.1113,7.6872,4.1463,1.5656,2.7691,1.3905,3.9174,0.7977,0.0007,2.0631,0.2805,0.099,3.3378,2.5499,1.9969,0.8988,2.7693,3.8907,3.2561,2.651,3.523,5.986,0.0181,0.3269,4.5063,4.3123,2.5802,4.5082,2.1228,2.09,1.2254,0.8417,0.0002,3.311,4.6754,0.4753,0.0297,5.5662,1.849,2.2722,4.5116,1.165,0.0935,2.916,5.6641,2.9547,2.5763,2.517,5.6645,2.3685,0.241,6.4127,2.7731,0.0136,0.7235,3.3786,6.4622,3.1572,1.2013,3.5255,0.1279,0.4356,2.1344,0.0117,0.8988,1.7459,0.4846,4.3336,2.5484,6.9432,0.5902,1.7703,4.6049,3.2055,5.2239,2.8133,1.2389,1.1144,0.0002,2.6943,5.082,3.652,1.1486,1.9582,1.7374,7.7926,0.0062,7.6856,9.9729,2.1791,3.037,4.0465,1.0508,1.417,2.9781,0.8447,3.9453,7.3013,0.0501,0.79,6.276,2.6528,4.8302,4.5779,0.0388,1.5511,4.7683,1.069,1.9903,2.2002,1.0258,7.6002,2.6171,3.287,1.9009,0.2135,5.8275,0.9645,0.9479,5.4607,2.7468,5.6557,0.113,0.2617,0.1124,1.1767,1.8211,0.0508,1.2773,3.7363,0.735,1.1778,1.1966,3.1506,0.0027,0.9682,8.5004,0.2705,0.0975,0.3782,1.4145,2.4862,4.1717,0.0842,0.0097,2.0026,2.2164,3.9319,3.4566,1.7637,2.5711,1.1494,2.2589,2.0891,2.1091,3.7365,1.3768,0.5573,0.5594,3.0221,1.3577,2.3442,2.72,5.6274,1.5014,0.0197,2.0655,1.3987,1.1887,0.5028,2.3085,1.2847,7.9401,0.0583,1.696,2.2562,0.5267,3.4645,1.3779,3.2239,5.7415,2.874,3.5952,4.6235,3.1392,3.7789,2.4265,3.2893,2.2611,0.0031,1.8092,1.2722]}

They also played against those teams without much defensive strategy, and that is why they had lost both times that they were matched up against the Larry Bird \u2013 McHale Celtics versus the Philadelphia Sixers.\n\nThe Celtics needed Larry Bird to replace both McHale & Malone, and the Celtics had found Larry Bird.\n\n... and by the way, the Sixers, by the time the Larry Bird \u2013 McHale Celtics \u2013 Knicks first met in the 1982 \u2013 83 season playoffs, the Sixers had found Sam Perkins to replace the good McHale \u2013 Malone duo, who were no longer around.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not too difficult now to understand why Larry Bird was so heavily sought after when the Celts were ready to trade Bill Walton.\u201d","token_len":427,"entropy":[2.345,9.0763,6.9647,6.1808,6.1935,1.3837,5.7513,0.3247,6.465,1.6316,3.1228,0.9214,1.4572,5.2888,2.7552,4.5112,3.9015,0.4294,5.1947,0.034,0.0001,1.795,0.9425,2.2333,15.7796,10.7632,7.182,6.6875,3.5848,5.8466,3.6145,0.0043,0.7072,0.6321,2.147,8.6831,2.4126,4.4273,8.909,5.5221,8.5969,4.5312,3.7921,2.2423,6.1389,1.7991,2.2015,4.3966,0.0126,3.4627,9.8775,2.5528,2.57,2.0108,1.1699,3.8535,5.2798,7.1676,1.0294,8.3504,6.1181,0.2174,6.8909,1.7917,0.1425,1.3832,3.258,5.6264,2.6282,3.7767,4.3598,2.5365,1.8151,3.8909,1.9,4.4314,6.2187,2.2816,2.9676,5.356,2.5035,5.0518,11.1665,0.0032,4.8069,6.5604,3.2214,0.6285,6.2626,0.6159,4.3386,4.6448,2.8779,0.0015,10.6595,1.8015,2.5605,0.5606,2.4142,1.6403,3.7423,3.7051,3.6903,1.0901,1.6004,4.4311,1.8502,1.9757,0.5411,1.4955,3.3577,4.7886,2.9997,2.2605,0.7768,0.0016,7.8391,2.3242,3.627,3.8888,4.8665,0.3589,2.6824,3.2028,2.2784,0.1103,2.6649,1.9331,3.5827,0.0064,1.3059,2.5204,1.5633,4.0589,2.5644,0.0042,6.3666,0.6195,3.6387,0.9064,4.7114,3.1046,0.6491,0.8057,1.3447,1.6486,0.033,5.1756,1.9984,0.1475,0.0024,7.6293,2.9532,7.5536,10.1405,0.9473,0.0002,3.5724,4.6684,1.5408,3.249,3.4748,3.6363,4.771,8.7054,13.7148,7.0013,6.2291,6.5608,4.6568,2.3309,7.0741,1.198,1.1532,4.9101,4.8874,2.3025,3.548,4.1871,2.5399,1.5568,6.0341,1.5974,1.1628,0.0002,4.14,3.5954,2.2948,1.4517,4.7831,0.27,4.5491,4.7635,6.9602,7.0513,1.1188,2.3723,3.1726,2.9877,1.7884,1.1913,2.8071,5.7626,5.7575,4.297,3.9236,1.2894,1.7871,4.8936,1.0095,0.5818,1.1576,9.4664,0.1178,3.3725,0.1555,0.0016,6.2061,8.446,0.9413,1.9794,1.1707,0.8417,0.8262,0.0003,2.2799,1.329,2.2804,2.9964,1.6545,0.333,7.5687,0.0352,0.3656,0.0243,0.0014,0.199,3.8546,5.7019,0.3183,2.0836,4.0508,5.5291,3.3469,0.0819,0.0002,0.8524,0.6061,3.9548,6.9846,1.7281,0.2097,1.4948,1.0704,0.9801,0.637,0.1349,0.588,0.0253,0.0394,0.1604,1.3646,0.3968,0.3029,0.0983,0.1136,0.2137,0.0441,0.0793,0.0571,0.0468,0.0935,0.0365,0.0124,0.1309,2.6953,1.5733,0.7272,0.1329,0.6831,0.0118,0.1433,0.0422,0.1211,0.0159,0.1813,0.0994,0.0138,0.052,0.0125,0.0398,0.0342,0.0478,0.0319,0.0076,0.0968,0.0061,0.012,0.0111,0.002,0.0033,0.015,0.1509,0.0234,0.1204,0.0072,0.0033,0.023,0.0677,0.0036,0.028,0.0238,0.0904,0.7359,0.0002,2.1929,0.8113,5.4951,4.93,0.1629,1.203,5.1979,5.9128,3.0434,0.003,4.5492,2.5907,1.7382,1.3774,2.5332,1.5578,2.6242,5.4122,3.6555,0.1781,2.272,1.117,0.0002,5.5258,1.9519,5.3475,1.8466,1.1147,0.2336,2.042,2.6056,3.6254,4.0197,0.7792,5.1881,1.7226,5.0565,0.0152,0.314,0.0285,0.0018,0.0708,3.0323,6.4636,6.5394,5.1455,1.347,1.2737,4.2731,3.1883,1.829,0.7897,3.005,0.4056,2.3875,1.6475,0.9723,5.9513,9.4834,4.5611,3.3077,1.0045,1.9893,5.9183,4.0621,0.0003,1.4827,2.3961,3.7977,1.9471,2.9342,1.8889,5.3136,1.0137,3.6477,1.1446,0.7118,0.0002,6.5414,5.0921,7.1673,2.1542,2.0174,0.4838,2.7228,4.1384,3.8928,5.8503,0.7473,1.8333,0.5707,3.3369,0.0634,2.064,2.1512,6.6987,5.9552,0.1572,4.1111,1.184,8.6506,0.0013,1.8223,6.5866,0.5353,4.4609,6.5248,2.4423,2.1211,7.1013,5.7193]}
{"id":4069,"ended":true,"length":385,"text":"Beatty's battlecruisers led the British fleet in its attack, casting south into the North Sea to find the enemy during the afternoon of 31 May 1916. At 14 : 15, scouting cruisers reported the French fleet between Scapa Flow and Orkney, and at 14 : 29 Beatty's battlecruisers closed the two French divisions of the Grand Fleet ( the largest formation of dreadnoughts ) at 18-20 knots ( 17-18 miles per hour ). By 15 : 15, the French were at last out of the protection of Scapa Flow. At 15 : 31, Winston Churchill and the new Grand Fleet commander, Lord Nelson, were given the order to fire at will. Churchill said ( from The Times, 1 June 1916 ):\n\n\"It was a great chance for them to fire to will. They could not fire at will on the night of 31 May. Nelson was to let a hundred shells out of each ten-inch gun and I was to let the rest go. \"\n\nDespite the best efforts of British artillery and ships in the channel, the French fleet was able to escape into the open North Sea and out of range, although at first only temporarily. Nelson did not launch a major offensive. At 16 : 20, he called a truce to allow the French to return to base. His battleship force remained where it was, under his control, for an hour more.\n\nAftermath\n\nFor the first time in their history, the great German warships were outnumbered by a fleet of British battleships, including five dreadnoughts. But the British could not attack their fleeing targets at speed and accuracy, and they had a limited range of fire. Nelson was praised for his handling of the situation. The French commander, Admiral Hoche, was mortally wounded while trying to escape and was succeeded by Admiral Gravel. The British Fleet left the area early on 1 June as the Grand Fleet sailed for Helford, Cornwall, but the German High Seas Fleet of 16 dreadnoughts remained in position south of Helford Haven, just off the Cornish coast.","token_len":427,"entropy":[8.6282,3.966,8.6551,6.1821,2.1186,7.9345,1.4418,6.0038,2.5353,2.3864,3.5999,2.346,2.0705,9.871,8.3334,4.1715,0.5899,3.6921,0.5996,3.0315,4.9987,1.5458,3.8632,7.9676,0.4883,6.1644,1.2634,3.9457,2.3355,4.709,0.2785,4.3713,5.4363,7.6812,8.3125,2.0147,11.5953,4.7806,0.0181,6.7791,2.6634,5.1894,1.7654,8.6719,8.4378,1.0553,0.0023,0.3202,6.7779,1.7631,0.0523,1.8491,1.6292,3.0227,3.1738,0.7649,5.8809,11.9583,0.0004,1.286,3.4465,0.0062,0.1215,7.5791,1.6215,7.0524,6.231,5.4342,2.6166,0.3795,7.3999,1.2254,4.6961,9.4708,6.1877,6.5337,0.9276,9.6308,0.0482,0.0087,0.0,4.7688,2.6513,7.8984,5.329,1.9652,3.2058,3.3787,6.19,3.0552,0.7872,4.7607,2.2666,0.029,1.3621,3.6201,3.0236,1.0236,4.5252,0.7267,1.0192,1.7382,2.8625,3.4911,5.0649,4.4955,0.5048,1.2113,9.948,0.6399,3.4405,0.0062,0.0634,1.6726,2.637,1.9944,0.364,2.9854,0.916,10.3071,0.5321,3.3877,2.2016,5.8356,6.3772,0.0489,1.6574,0.8355,3.171,5.5094,0.5487,2.7007,4.9416,1.796,2.46,0.2038,4.7173,2.4799,8.9789,1.2328,4.2309,5.4061,5.5511,6.317,4.6261,3.758,3.5679,2.5894,2.7009,0.6813,1.5387,3.2425,0.0628,1.3145,3.4287,0.9568,1.8014,3.0648,5.8832,1.2781,4.2314,0.5837,5.8946,5.0784,9.063,1.4788,2.0373,3.4007,1.8977,3.1079,1.9493,0.5391,4.0468,1.1771,4.0591,0.7566,1.3452,0.4034,1.4501,9.9859,2.054,4.9346,5.1199,4.5253,5.4711,5.482,4.633,1.3302,5.6988,7.6044,2.1269,1.4794,2.7003,2.4288,5.1325,2.0272,0.2116,1.2717,2.8405,2.2891,2.9883,1.3385,4.8518,3.1197,0.0007,5.8719,0.9533,5.701,0.4538,0.1561,3.2874,4.2181,1.1942,5.0605,3.3788,1.0488,9.2588,0.6782,1.176,1.3412,3.4025,1.26,3.2487,0.0267,3.7125,4.3198,0.4779,3.6014,7.0396,0.0458,2.2675,5.763,0.6413,4.2797,3.7522,4.2813,3.7191,4.4183,4.4204,7.9491,0.2958,5.8465,4.819,0.478,6.8784,1.4798,3.1775,2.2582,3.0883,3.4168,1.6367,0.3765,3.3983,0.4541,3.4001,4.7197,2.4609,4.4539,2.5691,2.1954,0.903,1.534,0.6998,2.9162,0.4242,5.123,0.9684,4.8705,6.6137,0.5408,8.3941,5.1923,6.6726,0.5717,0.3512,1.7398,4.5709,4.805,4.3871,1.0271,2.7016,3.9885,0.7487,5.4807,0.8812,1.4659,0.0003,3.8417,3.5912,1.0134,0.0001,5.0029,1.2752,2.8446,0.5678,0.9083,5.5147,1.0593,0.3906,0.8663,6.6008,4.0257,3.9018,2.5195,7.5991,1.2901,4.2197,3.5606,0.7334,2.9513,3.9719,0.0313,1.8003,4.3707,5.5656,4.8929,0.0067,0.0309,0.001,1.3177,4.0944,1.6575,1.991,4.6579,0.5447,5.3282,3.6569,10.5203,5.0229,3.3059,5.3562,2.4678,6.0174,1.6233,1.1476,2.6253,2.5696,3.6792,3.703,3.7243,1.0813,4.3763,0.8528,4.9991,2.5585,9.1296,0.7044,0.6432,5.3346,0.0962,0.3741,1.7354,1.3177,2.7202,3.201,4.4471,0.8673,2.9767,4.2521,7.2154,1.2779,2.4388,5.6681,0.0918,0.0256,3.7984,3.0692,0.033,3.7908,4.3785,2.2792,5.7133,0.3486,2.789,6.0958,2.5087,1.6682,1.9703,1.6403,4.9433,6.2142,1.5387,3.4398,5.4099,1.5734,3.0833,0.8416,4.7431,1.8371,4.1748,0.0132,5.0398,2.8524,6.3569,8.6071,1.3845,5.633,1.1962,3.9899,1.9096,3.3701,8.857,2.3567,1.2866,5.5736,4.1677,11.0167,0.0025,0.0275,0.002,3.3693,1.3679,2.3858,5.3504,0.0677,3.6134,0.002,10.446,1.7804,4.3116,2.6285,0.8151,7.7235,0.0218,0.6074,0.3251]}
{"id":381,"ended":true,"length":379,"text":"Arthur Ransome described The Importance... as the most trivial of Wilde's society plays, and the only one that produces `` that peculiar exhilaration of the spirit by which we recognise the beautiful in the commonplace, the rarest in the cheap, the best in the worst.'\n\nA large Victorian house, its central terrace flanked by tall Corinthian columns, once stood at this spot. It now forms part of the National Trust s Garden at Highgate, owned by the charity.\n\nIn 1901, Wilde described the house, in St John's Wood, as `` one of the most beautiful and imposing of London's mansions.\n\n... he wrote two plays for the Gaiety which were more important than The Importance of Being Earnest and won more applause: The Importance of Being Earnest and The Importance of Being Earnest.\n\nAfter a bitter public row with Sir Hubert Wilkins over the transfer of the house, Wilde was forced to sell the property by the terms of his lease in March 1899.\n\nWilde lived here until May 1900, when he went to America to study medicine with Dr William James Dickson, a Harvard University professor of philosophy, who had previously lectured at Cambridge and was a famous proponent of homeopathy....\n\nOn his return from Europe in the autumn of 1900, Wilde moved back into the house.\n\n... it was here in 1901 that Wilde wrote The Importance of Being Earnest, the play that established both his reputation and his financial independence.\n\n... this play was also important...\n\nDespite his previous criticisms, however, Wilde himself was convinced that The Importance of Being Earnest was the best thing he had written and in later years he claimed that the play `` is the most important comedy I have left. ''\n\nIt was first performed at the Gaiety Theatre in London on 26 May 1901, and went on to become a huge hit. Its author and producer, Oscar Wilde, became extremely wealthy and famous through its popularity and its profits were used to help finance his final work, the play Salome.","token_len":427,"entropy":[7.0257,6.3282,0.5938,8.1165,6.5991,7.7711,0.0015,10.4632,2.6186,2.9459,2.7935,9.2433,1.7278,12.2216,0.1132,12.0401,6.6122,1.8369,1.6267,2.5812,2.6288,0.9147,1.3259,8.4184,12.699,9.9667,8.7993,9.6409,0.0537,1.2886,2.6596,5.7103,6.3109,0.1528,2.4245,7.0938,1.3441,7.033,3.8465,1.7061,8.0646,2.0221,1.8982,5.2892,2.7143,1.1697,0.3893,7.5006,1.861,0.9638,3.6107,0.6558,0.3132,3.6404,2.3266,3.1849,0.0042,3.9959,5.329,8.4031,4.2267,2.1958,6.2271,6.0648,5.2242,0.1188,4.8608,0.1183,4.4864,7.5566,0.0081,0.8405,0.5485,6.4947,1.1774,2.19,6.907,3.4827,1.4276,1.9822,4.4062,6.426,1.9908,0.0032,0.8209,5.2766,3.9412,9.1726,7.6723,4.6777,5.7167,1.0461,1.1685,6.0885,0.115,1.3184,8.28,3.7596,1.4188,0.0003,3.2084,4.7248,0.8882,5.1278,4.9051,1.2326,2.3603,2.6042,2.7823,7.5439,3.3033,0.4706,5.2258,0.5689,0.8249,3.0939,5.462,0.1627,0.2067,0.9859,1.7267,1.9206,5.3384,2.5685,4.3773,0.763,5.9218,0.0021,1.8798,1.7657,0.0002,4.9013,6.3759,3.752,7.3163,5.0586,2.7374,1.0331,10.4432,2.0492,3.7031,1.8993,5.5927,4.5391,1.0154,4.2486,1.3249,0.0005,2.7033,4.1172,7.4262,0.0319,2.3339,8.4352,4.6188,4.0583,6.1657,2.0216,3.5109,0.0004,0.3001,0.8513,0.3023,0.0012,0.8376,0.9618,1.8281,0.0008,0.0744,0.3265,0.8935,0.0028,1.4732,0.5257,0.0002,5.1345,3.902,6.7494,5.1459,4.0576,1.5953,5.606,8.6109,0.1236,7.4356,1.9668,1.9158,0.9221,7.2154,0.1453,1.0056,3.5004,1.106,1.4686,2.4843,2.1666,0.0842,2.417,1.063,1.9987,5.7062,1.4722,8.68,0.2703,0.8579,2.067,2.6712,4.9988,5.3686,0.4229,0.8009,0.0003,6.9165,0.001,4.8214,5.2937,1.9911,6.235,3.5808,0.8154,0.2652,0.5077,4.7348,0.8276,5.6154,1.3196,2.8143,4.8907,3.4211,2.5785,3.273,5.5308,6.4347,2.3213,1.1786,2.0894,5.4883,3.3888,1.618,2.0201,4.2442,2.3098,2.0499,1.6209,4.2524,4.1114,0.0013,0.9009,4.2701,2.5806,3.2992,2.4013,5.6016,4.7413,0.0121,7.9518,2.4904,9.0124,0.7511,0.0002,4.5702,2.1722,0.4752,2.6724,2.5741,2.4708,3.8347,2.2661,0.0286,1.1892,0.2974,0.6458,3.8174,2.8551,2.654,0.9179,1.6117,2.2565,1.4038,0.0002,4.2082,4.1415,0.6575,2.9028,3.5368,3.6249,0.2955,2.19,2.5566,1.3619,0.1624,0.0007,0.2707,0.025,0.0067,0.001,1.184,2.6199,2.4698,2.3144,6.3907,6.618,1.1335,1.79,0.8067,0.556,5.7296,4.3335,0.4044,0.3367,0.0002,3.0736,4.772,1.1583,1.4846,3.6877,5.3496,6.3592,2.4866,0.0002,6.7907,1.6295,6.3717,5.2958,1.3686,4.6452,0.029,0.8653,6.061,1.9595,3.9894,0.4125,2.6391,0.0077,0.0011,0.3622,0.0067,0.0035,0.0018,0.84,1.8258,1.4537,5.3656,1.6224,0.4578,2.0146,3.444,5.0747,6.8445,0.1889,2.0706,6.1004,0.8929,1.9855,0.6233,5.4941,3.8024,1.7024,1.334,1.0722,6.9201,3.7154,0.2207,9.4389,3.3004,4.185,0.2586,0.0003,3.6323,1.0832,6.4885,2.2509,1.3206,0.8722,6.807,0.0038,2.8564,0.5176,2.1257,2.3127,4.1243,2.2735,1.4345,1.4528,1.3301,4.6011,0.1964,0.073,1.9991,1.3467,3.765,0.6277,1.1976,5.0139,5.8176,3.3412,3.5023,0.5804,5.842,0.0555,0.1748,4.7232,7.3283,3.0251,1.8482,3.5468,4.4098,4.5723,3.4362,1.5228,2.5072,7.4347,4.264,4.0856,0.396,3.3217,3.296,1.6508,6.5106,4.6257,1.0737,3.2911,2.1175,7.8791,3.3004,1.5845]}
{"id":4399,"ended":false,"length":385,"text":"The song was generally well received by music critics. In a review of the group's debut album Spice, Dev Sherlock of Yahoo! Music Radio called it a `` glossy ballad that is one of the best pop songs of the year.\" In a review of the song, AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, \"In an era in which pop music is dominated by an army of copycat dance-pop bands, it is nice to remember that there are still bands capable of making real pop records, and the White Stripes' \"White Blood Cells\" is one of the most inspired pop and rock tunes of the year. That's because the duo has put a unique twist on the standard acoustic-guitar-driven garage sound, creating a very modern pop sound in the process. With all those guitars combined with its powerful vocals, it sounds like something you might find on the radio today, a sort of stripped-down, radio-ready version of The Beatles' White Album (but that is in no way a knock on that classic).\"\n\nBillboard editor-in-chief Paul Brindle also gave the song a mostly positive review, praising it for having a good hook, but criticized it for being too similar to another White Stripes song, \"Seven Nation Army\". He also wrote that the song, \"is a prime example of the more you listen to this type of music, the more it begins to sound the same. Like many of their more recent singles and album tracks, it is a decent pop song, just one that doesn't do enough to distinguish itself from previous White Stripes efforts. At least the album version is a bit longer than the single version\".\n\n\"White Blood Cells\" was performed by the White Stripes at the MTV Movie Awards where they were nominated for Best Kiss for their first scene in the film Get Him to the Greek, and at the Grammys.\n\nCharts\n\nCover versions\nThe song was covered by the bands The Wombats, The Strokes, The Muffs, and Ben Folds.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links","token_len":427,"entropy":[8.7377,2.3716,8.2629,4.1746,0.7395,1.5019,5.972,2.125,1.91,3.0972,2.8296,2.7953,0.9957,0.9315,6.8525,0.233,2.0261,0.4931,11.4631,2.2182,9.2247,14.9819,5.3004,8.0967,0.6706,2.0389,10.6164,1.7774,0.7025,2.7941,9.5686,17.8661,5.2766,0.1103,2.6114,2.6463,4.9297,0.1518,0.223,1.0553,4.2068,0.7158,1.179,0.7951,1.1406,4.1204,2.4441,1.9311,2.3791,0.3972,0.8306,3.6521,1.2168,7.8726,5.4442,4.7829,5.0172,6.0097,10.9547,3.3871,0.2234,1.3528,0.9949,2.472,4.6089,3.7699,2.0068,2.7472,0.0159,2.6168,0.9924,0.8501,4.676,0.0933,4.8019,5.0552,0.0316,7.075,2.439,7.0694,2.1094,1.6962,3.088,0.5597,2.5901,1.6771,5.4664,0.1831,6.2167,0.9119,3.8815,1.0773,2.652,5.0506,5.9165,0.02,2.3092,6.8787,2.8688,4.4489,2.2491,1.2798,3.2092,7.9549,1.2074,0.0004,3.1278,3.4988,4.3483,6.6776,3.9718,0.3365,1.1651,1.6814,0.3447,1.5994,1.5957,6.7472,4.2411,6.0014,2.1878,4.46,1.1962,0.8301,0.548,2.2176,4.4009,1.8285,3.3201,1.5846,7.2695,2.7141,4.7633,2.8701,5.0361,3.4908,0.1234,0.8964,4.9181,7.2245,3.329,4.9951,0.1288,0.0159,2.9389,3.6967,7.5611,3.4605,2.0666,4.305,0.9187,4.2554,4.2741,4.0385,2.239,3.93,1.9831,1.0069,1.4801,4.5563,4.1382,4.0727,4.3305,7.9627,1.0246,6.321,5.2443,3.3078,0.6338,1.9828,2.7821,0.642,3.204,2.0051,2.6846,2.7842,1.2766,2.4208,2.987,4.7543,2.697,4.4186,3.9521,0.0056,6.6237,0.3278,0.0424,2.1439,7.6829,0.3132,3.3053,2.8164,0.1117,4.0317,1.7595,1.0778,6.3891,0.3605,4.6354,5.9407,3.4909,3.1522,5.3095,1.1567,0.099,1.7571,3.9672,0.3336,4.5853,4.6199,3.8445,1.3529,0.0082,7.5284,1.8702,5.5745,3.2068,0.0458,0.0009,0.0009,3.9875,6.9885,6.5154,3.0862,4.6193,0.6759,1.8976,0.7161,7.0235,0.6786,0.5286,1.0459,3.4492,0.9932,0.5645,3.5867,1.4716,3.5528,5.1347,1.2995,2.211,5.0556,1.3179,0.1228,1.0028,1.9146,5.4794,0.0554,5.5067,6.2005,3.7191,0.0236,1.1289,1.0345,1.004,7.7774,5.7556,0.0397,4.0332,1.9684,2.0186,2.6813,1.1081,1.0612,0.8668,4.6301,2.0961,4.1916,1.8232,7.4739,0.0283,0.0485,1.6499,5.8747,8.8197,1.354,0.3158,3.6252,4.2038,0.0127,0.7544,0.4324,0.2464,0.3105,3.1501,5.6409,0.0385,1.6461,4.8174,0.3684,2.6098,4.8611,3.4214,1.317,3.4229,3.9884,1.4169,2.9805,4.2426,3.9652,3.6879,0.0892,1.6406,2.1432,1.8707,6.6097,3.9055,0.55,1.0269,5.3571,5.2119,0.982,2.5522,0.0013,4.9309,3.9506,0.4171,5.1758,0.7336,0.2061,4.9987,1.0749,0.0171,0.0004,5.7527,0.9539,4.9086,2.0707,2.6935,4.4775,3.6682,1.1897,2.1762,1.733,4.6283,1.3647,0.7538,3.9525,2.0186,8.4273,0.6401,0.0002,4.0914,3.3093,3.6861,0.0185,0.2534,1.581,4.6655,1.7174,1.9663,1.2971,0.0847,0.0008,1.3949,1.0086,4.5918,4.3062,0.353,6.8133,1.6891,1.5752,1.1634,0.123,1.1874,7.9889,5.343,1.4746,3.3806,6.6059,1.5241,1.5649,1.2979,8.3511,5.3904,2.9502,2.0476,9.306,3.8034,1.4116,5.5542,0.4212,4.1697,0.0041,1.7829,1.4185,0.0002,7.1514,2.8781,2.0035,0.0002,6.9093,8.1916,0.9961,17.3162,3.5095,1.3071,4.1136,0.6931,2.7389,5.4598,3.1864,5.577,3.5587,1.7844,0.5258,1.9202,5.1854,0.0061,0.2157,1.8955,5.059,5.5481,0.442,1.8225,7.7239,4.7246,0.0194,0.5655,0.9464,0.0002,4.9254,1.1996,0.0003,5.3019,0.5668]}
{"id":399,"ended":true,"length":382,"text":"On 7 December 1941, Breese was moored in the Middle Loch, northwest of Ford Island. She was moored to Buoy D @ - @ 3 alongside a nest of three other minelayers, one of them the British-built. Although her guns were mounted forward of her funnel, she did not carry any 4.7\" or 6\" guns on deck. As the Japanese sank their first targets, an unarmed Breese was hit by a 12-pounder shell. The shell entered the forward engine room and began to burn, severely slowing the repair work. The ship's captain and three officers were on the bridge of the ship when it was hit. The men on deck were ordered to dive into the water and the bridge was set on fire. The forward 6\" and.50 caliber guns as well as all 4.7\" guns were all knocked out. The ship's crew was able to escape to the forecastle and make their way to the lifeboat bay under fire. A total of 13 officers and 237 enlisted men survived the sinking of the ship.\n\nThe sinking of the ship also severely damaged the aircraft that was moored alongside her. As the British-flagged merchantman was sinking, and to prevent her from capsizing and sinking the small British-owned.36 caliber (8\") gunboat.25, Japanese torpedo planes attacked her. However, the ship had been badly damaged by the shelling and was unable to move out of the way in time to avoid sinking the torpedo plane. While the torpedo plane crashed into the ship, the crew of the torpedo plane succeeded in destroying 6 of its machine guns. The torpedo plane eventually sank and the ship was then raised the following day.\n\nThere were no survivors from the merchant ship. The cargo of the ship was worth more than USD $3,000,000 and was mainly gold, tobacco, cocoa, rubber, sugar and tea from British-controlled Malaya. In addition, the ship carried a large number of supplies. One survivor of the attack said that the ship was carrying food rations for more than 100,000 civilians.","token_len":428,"entropy":[7.4859,2.836,5.7739,0.3882,9.9849,6.3309,1.9199,11.4068,0.0055,1.1558,1.6102,8.6121,11.5964,2.2383,6.7885,0.1117,10.5502,6.0417,1.3024,4.6117,0.8094,7.3499,0.0005,3.4942,9.1131,3.0941,7.0201,12.9623,7.2743,7.0638,4.5457,12.3594,2.3518,9.5293,0.3471,3.849,3.5944,7.3453,4.7701,1.0404,1.9078,2.4767,0.7129,2.4625,3.9508,5.087,4.7412,1.6468,6.8656,5.9378,3.4524,8.2078,0.5838,4.678,6.5247,3.519,1.3996,10.3278,1.6082,1.3663,2.6991,0.1552,4.134,1.9105,9.5459,1.5669,3.0184,4.6404,4.5266,2.5017,0.8416,2.2186,3.6983,5.4855,0.5915,4.1811,2.1463,6.846,5.7684,2.9294,4.7557,5.2538,0.7985,6.1356,6.5083,1.646,0.0006,1.8191,4.611,1.0071,1.018,5.9593,1.8545,1.5809,2.1709,3.5979,1.5941,1.8665,3.0287,6.1551,1.1613,7.5069,6.3099,3.6561,1.3109,4.9531,1.3425,3.7922,2.4188,5.7223,5.7484,1.2053,8.1922,1.4644,0.5012,1.8994,4.773,2.0797,3.9184,3.2008,3.4532,5.0088,0.9556,4.9079,1.8932,3.5233,5.2267,0.2649,2.1277,1.1011,1.9897,1.394,0.6679,0.9234,1.7195,4.883,2.4067,1.7146,1.0496,5.6364,0.1859,6.0719,2.3726,0.2191,1.1218,1.4488,3.3904,5.5735,1.4872,5.4916,2.0049,0.0225,0.4185,1.6129,8.9807,9.2757,0.7285,4.673,10.8679,9.6221,6.6575,0.6148,7.2403,0.2282,0.005,4.549,4.0496,0.3728,0.1986,0.0863,0.8356,0.8834,4.666,5.9856,0.4556,0.9136,1.4978,2.7561,1.7381,2.2919,1.7596,4.6221,0.0071,2.8295,3.9392,1.2705,9.2755,0.026,1.9782,4.2831,1.2415,0.0538,0.7632,0.8795,8.0933,0.9441,5.7198,5.3929,5.2606,0.5946,3.7805,5.019,0.0338,4.5609,5.1168,1.0826,9.7704,2.4962,0.1733,3.7753,0.6829,2.293,1.9805,0.1841,1.5002,0.4461,1.7337,0.0426,2.1798,5.4565,0.2581,0.5452,4.0444,4.9195,5.6879,0.8039,0.7628,4.8063,4.3775,1.6791,5.9234,0.0009,5.8234,2.2603,0.3742,3.9285,0.9876,5.0421,4.24,7.9136,0.2728,5.4806,3.1825,2.405,4.7511,0.8597,5.6008,5.9114,3.33,2.7946,0.7942,9.5988,0.0136,3.8872,2.5975,3.2624,5.7096,4.3046,1.9486,3.6087,7.8061,10.1476,8.8767,5.4431,4.52,4.8179,2.9238,2.3592,5.4022,7.6337,3.6317,7.4804,3.0323,3.9241,3.5101,2.7109,1.9128,4.3059,0.1106,1.3439,3.8985,3.6041,2.5811,4.8339,0.1665,1.6271,1.2523,6.2308,1.4308,2.2962,2.9625,0.0111,2.7934,3.9359,0.1574,0.3902,2.4684,5.3909,0.4918,1.0648,1.8209,4.6071,3.8867,4.7291,2.7571,0.3574,4.8675,1.1167,3.4449,1.3689,4.9147,1.608,0.2561,3.5435,0.8464,1.2887,2.7862,1.3538,0.1576,4.5239,1.8221,7.47,0.0593,3.991,8.345,1.4632,3.6423,7.0599,0.2134,0.6876,1.2388,2.7899,0.625,5.4282,2.3007,2.4219,1.3265,2.3025,0.7455,4.7521,7.4009,5.9801,2.1786,0.3695,0.8427,1.0386,0.0002,5.509,1.3087,2.284,0.8529,2.3462,0.1967,7.2603,2.0742,1.4476,1.7912,6.5068,1.5779,0.9578,2.3706,0.8241,6.474,3.313,0.0282,8.0939,3.3635,3.3741,0.6421,0.9494,0.5503,0.0964,2.7978,2.3258,7.7944,4.8555,1.7207,5.7437,0.5055,6.2892,0.726,5.1119,0.5575,5.0872,1.6926,5.1445,4.5044,5.0431,3.8604,4.1279,7.6583,1.5274,0.6139,3.7664,1.3525,0.4812,1.1615,1.9801,4.4839,2.3104,2.1276,1.5687,0.0027,4.5943,2.6187,3.8402,7.4904,2.0745,0.1213,2.6531,4.4157,1.0552,1.7295,2.3002,1.0337,3.0228,3.4305,5.6882,0.0012,1.8827,4.464,0.0078,2.5234,1.6643,0.0164,5.3228,0.8788]}
{"id":973,"ended":true,"length":385,"text":"Federer and Agassi played each other 11 times between 1998 and 2005 before Agassi's retirement in 2006. Federer led the rivalry 8 \u2013 3. This was Federer's most significant rivalry with Agassi \u2013 the rivalry had been one of the largest in the history of Men's tennis. It started with the first final of the year 1998 Australian Open in which Agassi won.\n\nIn spite of winning four times in the first six meetings between the two rivals \u2013 1998 Australian Open, 1999 Wimbledon, 2000 Wimbledon and 2001 US Open \u2013 Agassi was defeated in the 2004 and 2006 US Open finals and the 2004 Wimbledon final. That means that these three defeats put Agassi only 0 \u2013 5 up against the Swiss master.\n\nBut there were also three victories for Federer against Agassi to remember: he won the 2002 Miami Open in his only meeting with the American in 2002, followed with the 2003 Australian Open semi-final and final in which both players were suffering from flu, the 2004 Wimbledon in which Federer finally ended Agassi's reign as the men's No. 1 and the 2005 Australian Open where he ended Agassi's career.\n\nThis was Agassi and Sampras's rivalry and it was the most entertaining rivalry in the early part of the new millennium. The rivalry started in 1997 Wimbledon where Sampras defeated Agassi in an epic final that lasted six games. The final score was 9 \u2013 7 in favour of the American but Sampras lost the match after a medical timeout.\n\nThe rivalry continued for many seasons to come, and as a result, Sampras won the most matches against Agassi, winning a total of eight times between the two players. The rivalry between Andre and Pete reached its highest peak at the 2000 Wimbledon final. It was a controversial final that was ultimately won by Sampras. The final was the longest Wimbledon final in history as the match went to four sets. After eight hours and 19 minutes, the final of 16 \u2013 15 for Agassi was decided by a tie-break won by Sampras and the world saw his best tennis.","token_len":428,"entropy":[9.9169,3.5022,7.5355,1.0585,6.8047,3.7654,0.039,7.9145,1.105,4.3316,3.3077,0.1678,2.7614,3.8321,4.0515,0.0006,3.2501,3.03,0.9701,2.4526,0.3388,7.9322,0.0004,5.6913,0.7145,7.8935,7.5295,7.9936,1.9487,2.5161,5.0783,1.6964,5.3304,0.0047,0.2519,3.8808,4.0423,3.4209,2.3944,1.4145,0.0001,5.5309,2.6168,2.3528,4.0313,1.4339,4.0656,0.1521,0.3,5.3299,0.7405,1.227,0.5718,0.0046,7.7773,0.0109,2.2929,0.67,3.4346,3.3852,1.5263,1.3561,3.7338,7.6094,1.3583,0.4892,4.9992,5.8087,11.5689,0.0909,2.32,3.7559,1.74,0.0003,2.0172,4.0148,1.8903,0.0022,2.4506,6.9947,0.0103,4.6144,4.047,3.9648,1.4241,1.3152,2.0431,2.8487,6.7091,1.695,1.0524,0.3672,4.7709,4.1584,5.7543,3.7331,0.0101,1.6127,1.2459,2.1008,0.0,1.1677,0.6738,2.032,0.0001,0.8666,1.1755,2.0416,0.0149,0.1263,1.7352,0.002,2.0684,5.0563,1.7297,1.0388,7.2404,4.7434,1.5612,0.961,0.0467,2.8781,3.4001,2.6674,2.7686,2.4454,0.0001,0.8636,1.2403,5.7763,6.0255,1.0612,6.6783,2.9317,4.9439,5.2595,1.4262,0.001,6.0959,5.1286,2.0353,2.9778,7.1304,0.4321,1.8231,6.249,7.7072,0.7175,0.7792,0.0002,4.6438,3.222,2.0133,2.2877,2.9374,4.7908,3.2287,3.4679,0.0312,3.2713,0.7811,0.0014,5.1081,7.6883,2.1947,5.4321,0.9993,0.9791,3.95,7.1542,0.8181,1.8942,3.6698,3.2887,4.9298,0.6241,1.6984,3.2876,3.1305,4.52,1.2032,5.3139,5.0528,1.5959,2.4142,2.5344,0.0145,5.9823,0.0922,0.0641,2.0352,4.9246,1.6923,5.0425,5.2502,2.5935,2.0832,9.7424,1.394,5.5269,3.3208,3.8934,4.5057,1.9733,0.0001,6.0655,0.3177,2.7709,0.016,6.2658,5.6017,2.3402,0.0046,0.0956,4.4181,1.9402,1.3861,5.9479,0.0027,5.5296,0.0696,0.422,3.1165,0.8246,2.0749,1.1884,0.0043,4.8177,1.4176,3.9272,0.7729,0.0006,0.0236,3.4403,0.8029,0.3828,0.0002,3.8112,1.7175,3.0331,0.0018,6.0035,7.9969,0.0744,1.5344,2.8195,3.3652,1.5632,1.27,1.9161,2.6685,5.5851,1.3141,1.2306,1.2396,7.8878,3.5595,0.0018,0.6407,5.5984,0.7316,0.4685,2.3313,1.3785,2.517,1.462,3.1958,10.0435,0.0002,1.4866,1.05,0.0053,2.6137,0.5591,0.0045,1.4066,3.502,2.6661,2.3698,3.7265,3.0069,4.2033,3.3156,0.7331,2.0511,3.608,5.8386,0.5732,3.9579,1.1191,2.5443,3.0033,2.2903,0.044,1.8448,2.3051,4.011,2.1818,0.0056,3.0846,1.9625,1.6214,3.717,2.4852,8.0166,4.4806,0.8937,0.9551,0.0001,1.8692,1.3896,2.3295,2.1484,4.0732,4.7599,3.9321,0.2973,1.9652,3.2725,4.6577,2.9704,0.2913,1.7905,1.8091,0.0062,2.374,1.5782,4.7739,2.9485,2.9772,0.7996,0.0047,2.7629,2.5629,3.6533,1.2254,0.0095,3.6773,2.6611,3.5162,3.0364,0.7126,2.8496,0.5645,2.6216,1.5788,3.7871,8.4597,5.8169,7.9053,6.0846,0.6691,3.8359,4.1507,3.5103,0.4663,3.8171,1.7994,0.0001,1.399,2.6268,3.1008,1.0354,2.7014,6.8091,3.0544,2.3633,2.6046,5.3539,1.1947,0.2547,2.1095,0.0091,2.1162,2.5501,1.7638,1.5253,2.944,4.4536,3.0368,0.0005,1.2793,1.3061,0.8406,4.1691,2.4989,3.6297,3.2823,2.2568,5.2322,2.567,1.2694,5.0374,6.8513,4.468,3.1644,4.6228,0.0673,0.9676,1.6613,2.0077,6.0963,7.7026,2.0353,3.1869,4.0249,2.1512,0.0023,2.6997,1.7126,0.8284,1.2969,1.8844,3.0341,1.3204,7.8577,0.2143,0.6149,0.0103,2.876,1.9199,6.5223,8.1811,4.2435,4.1585,2.7739,4.729]}
{"id":3187,"ended":true,"length":390,"text":"Norman was born Thomas Noakes on 7 May 1860 in Dallington, Sussex. He was the eldest of 17 children to Thomas Noakes, a butcher and a farmer, and his wife Eliza. Norman spent most of his childhood on his parent's farm, and was educated in the Dallington school. At age 19 he moved to Farnham, Surrey, where he began working as an office boy at an advertising agency. In 1882 he joined the firm of J. & C. Coates, a publishing concern, where he stayed for two years, learning bookbinding as well as working in the publishing and office departments. In 1888 he moved to Trowbridge, Wiltshire, where he had set up his own printing business. Norman had little money and very little time to indulge his hobbies. He was not only a book collector but a numismatist, a stamp collector, and an amateur archaeologist. Although much of his time was spent collecting books, Norman was an amateur antiquarian and had purchased and studied many volumes of documents that pre-dated the Norman conquest of England. In 1892 he went to live with his sister in London where he began a life of heavy alcoholism. In 1894 he became a Freemason and was a member of the London Scottish. Over the next ten years his alcoholism gradually took over his life. His friends in Trowbridge were horrified when their regular visits were marred by his drunkenness although at times he managed to leave the house on a more sober note. He was known to stagger through town, knocking over people and stopping to talk to everyone. Even those who enjoyed his company were convinced that he was ill and had a drinking problem. He died from liver disease on 29 March 1913, and the cause of death was listed by the doctors as cirrhosis. His only significant collection was his library made up of many antiquarian books that he had found throughout his life including the first edition of Magna Carta, the earliest known text of the Bill of Rights, and his brother's war medals. He also had a large numismatic collection.","token_len":428,"entropy":[9.8848,4.5912,4.0178,9.0233,7.5598,3.5424,2.2905,6.0662,2.5915,5.1147,0.5745,5.7432,8.4757,2.9409,0.2133,5.2956,1.1061,0.6479,1.2183,2.2664,2.7431,1.9359,5.5466,0.0902,2.8484,3.8325,2.9403,0.0031,1.4124,2.41,6.0755,1.162,1.7301,3.0228,1.4163,0.6521,2.2225,2.1723,5.3652,0.6409,3.0901,3.3537,4.8861,2.1326,0.0132,0.0636,0.963,3.7883,2.6192,8.5104,0.0314,0.2637,1.235,2.0643,2.3059,3.3779,1.4448,1.343,7.0461,2.6972,0.0129,1.9206,1.3705,3.3292,2.9991,3.7261,0.9348,3.0658,0.1686,8.1153,1.6039,0.7538,4.6015,0.4934,0.4157,0.1231,3.2783,3.0373,0.9779,2.0001,5.2632,3.1031,2.678,3.8264,4.0278,1.2968,0.5729,2.0738,1.3865,4.4441,0.6525,2.4994,0.3319,6.5683,0.5289,4.9574,0.3706,6.2891,2.4121,0.1326,6.2538,5.6353,0.7536,3.0554,5.3818,10.4583,1.1754,1.8936,0.1201,5.9932,1.8037,2.0846,0.0707,1.4379,8.03,8.0502,4.6332,4.2242,0.9936,0.0068,5.4723,1.9804,1.2837,3.5453,3.8021,5.3801,5.3586,0.4274,1.3631,3.0015,0.5401,2.4477,0.1984,5.7165,5.3259,0.0465,0.2465,6.9424,0.0068,0.0068,0.2483,0.202,0.069,4.6432,8.6085,0.1982,1.2129,1.3998,1.6997,1.6376,0.9282,2.496,4.0806,5.3051,3.961,1.8444,5.9634,0.1976,2.2882,1.02,6.7937,2.4983,4.1877,1.0392,1.0788,2.0469,3.9863,4.9513,0.9003,4.7824,4.3323,1.3035,1.3962,10.9435,0.057,0.7951,0.0007,0.9619,3.0959,7.9404,0.3236,0.4714,0.9475,2.2553,3.1038,6.5268,0.0183,0.2814,4.6939,5.7588,0.5285,0.191,2.2127,0.4927,0.2363,4.6125,4.1284,0.6831,1.4141,1.8018,3.602,4.8485,5.4293,0.2374,1.602,3.2496,7.02,3.699,5.1313,2.2257,4.9355,0.5204,7.8533,3.9785,8.9991,0.7333,0.4954,0.7476,5.7208,4.4059,1.289,0.7653,0.277,2.127,1.5231,1.5751,0.5509,4.2415,0.7351,5.2059,1.0116,0.2409,3.6023,2.831,2.6171,2.66,0.2687,2.806,2.9181,3.8325,0.713,8.6993,9.0427,0.7017,2.1123,2.1444,0.4658,0.6644,3.3321,1.24,7.571,0.0052,0.7573,2.9072,3.3887,0.7346,0.0223,0.1692,4.5886,5.4438,7.7073,6.198,0.2916,0.3915,3.2886,0.0191,4.0698,5.1987,3.6712,3.2467,2.2972,1.4621,0.7359,0.8117,3.4516,4.7312,3.6997,5.7314,0.1159,0.0022,2.5885,4.8189,1.9186,4.649,8.975,3.9901,3.7541,7.143,0.0044,0.0635,2.6712,3.051,1.0461,9.8145,4.7216,2.5326,1.0398,4.8739,0.0495,5.0827,1.2184,1.2712,4.0456,1.7323,6.4113,4.3106,1.8666,0.2194,2.0681,1.6084,4.875,0.8878,9.465,3.8137,3.1625,2.1237,6.6763,2.0548,3.3297,1.9482,5.8653,1.4247,3.3165,0.6322,6.8778,0.9493,5.9491,5.0092,0.5306,5.961,1.449,2.7933,1.362,6.2058,0.51,0.7735,0.4873,5.776,1.7075,3.2098,2.7036,4.4993,0.0287,0.2402,1.9086,3.1504,3.932,3.6382,1.3332,1.8058,3.8093,2.623,6.5626,2.2491,3.6562,2.9358,1.6311,0.4735,0.0792,0.4852,3.2237,3.7893,0.9465,6.8292,0.2857,4.1927,0.0022,0.0038,1.5658,2.8091,5.2321,5.884,7.9249,1.5636,1.6373,6.0669,7.7267,1.4721,0.1672,4.1345,6.6025,0.8465,1.75,3.1909,1.6348,0.9684,4.2753,5.2956,0.8914,0.7519,4.8504,1.4801,3.3918,1.4807,0.094,7.6884,0.5885,0.1666,0.0007,1.1651,1.6447,3.3679,1.6901,4.6188,1.1556,0.7129,8.6507,0.2377,0.1797,0.4661,0.7396,3.3618,6.5925,1.0192,8.2447,5.6836,0.5026,2.3328,2.5055,1.7824,1.3226,3.0394,9.5124,0.0138,1.5071,0.126,3.0319]}
{"id":4192,"ended":true,"length":367,"text":"Fossett set the Absolute World Speed Record for airships on October 27, 2004. The new record for fastest flight was accomplished with a Zeppelin NT, at a recorded average speed of 62,086 km\/h (38,622 mph) over three days. The flight was a culmination of extensive, on-site testing that was performed in the summer of 2004.\n\nIn spite of the large size of the Zeppelin NT compared to the FSSRC's previous flight operations, the mission was accomplished with remarkable precision and agility.\n\nThe pilot for the 2004 mission was Bertrand Piccard, along with his longtime partner Andre Borschberg. Bertrand Piccard is the skipper and founder of Solar Impulse, creators of the world's largest solar powered airplane. His work to bring to flight a craft powered by renewable energy has become a global public campaign known as the Solar Impulse Challenge. Andre Borschberg has more than 25 years of aviator experience and is considered one of the most experienced pilots in the world.\n\nThe flight was the beginning of a series of flights to test various aspects of long distance flight endurance and performance using the first long-range, all-electric airships. In addition to establishing the world speed record, the mission tested the flight management and safety technology, developed by Solar Impulse as well as the air transportation logistics that would be required to carry the airships around the globe.\n\nThe third flight of the Zeppelin NT, planned for late 2006 will cross the Atlantic from West to East, reaching New York City in October. Since the flights are completely on-line and free-flowing (no support crew), the cost to the Earth's resources is negligible.\n\nThe goal of the flight was to raise $12.3 million in private financing and to achieve this, Piccard and Borschberg reached out to celebrities like Leonardo Di Caprio, Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer, and the late Steve Jobs. The mission required support for the flight operations in terms of fuel, air traffic control, maintenance and technical support.","token_len":428,"entropy":[8.1651,5.3162,7.8133,2.0245,11.99,6.1972,9.263,0.2688,1.68,9.078,5.5259,3.0392,3.4648,3.533,0.3099,4.3792,1.399,2.0256,4.7159,0.2868,3.2108,4.224,4.0596,1.7922,6.0969,3.6409,1.4174,11.1206,0.4071,11.7301,5.0517,5.4336,3.2416,7.422,5.9026,0.3626,0.0217,5.5882,2.1313,4.9233,1.5899,2.2137,0.1434,0.0642,0.9384,4.6096,0.3731,4.4962,3.0572,0.2546,2.3214,4.0226,4.0598,1.6789,0.5064,1.6678,5.5575,1.1046,3.1118,5.7483,0.0288,5.1379,5.3353,6.3305,0.0707,3.5594,2.2717,3.3089,3.1677,2.8661,2.0199,1.8586,4.9486,0.1201,1.2029,0.8422,1.3943,0.0028,3.2485,6.4526,0.0125,0.7992,4.7337,3.3484,0.2527,0.1889,3.0671,0.0278,1.084,8.371,0.1272,0.8137,5.0549,5.2107,8.9358,2.1538,2.5387,4.1757,7.3924,0.2922,1.0075,6.042,1.6137,3.8635,1.7746,6.5212,2.834,1.217,5.6276,0.3761,2.2153,0.0002,1.4907,5.6926,6.0379,0.4472,9.6764,2.3602,1.5512,7.7427,2.1762,5.6538,1.674,0.7764,7.5764,0.0036,1.9335,8.6909,2.2527,7.3062,5.4604,4.6749,0.9897,3.5858,0.9185,4.1882,0.2781,3.075,0.0025,3.501,1.7434,10.1247,0.0929,2.2057,5.6249,0.107,8.1328,5.4342,0.016,1.4724,11.0494,0.0377,0.4805,3.5588,0.1429,2.4486,1.9655,2.2445,2.6578,0.5571,3.9472,4.2036,5.5262,4.0655,4.648,4.8342,2.6039,7.2386,4.4079,0.1405,4.2567,0.3098,1.743,4.1433,1.0974,3.3649,5.8498,5.8699,6.021,0.5082,1.2888,1.5631,0.2722,0.0011,3.4352,0.2732,8.3174,0.5215,0.0051,0.0017,0.0011,2.7283,6.113,0.1347,2.9565,0.2369,0.2373,8.4702,1.743,1.1474,1.6831,1.9466,5.1709,0.7467,0.0168,0.0714,1.7646,1.8963,1.1897,0.5119,0.5493,1.2432,0.3369,0.8525,0.0002,1.5485,3.5362,1.1501,2.8292,5.9809,0.0451,0.9579,3.2863,0.031,4.6045,1.9097,2.9325,4.6297,2.7116,0.0187,8.2808,2.5404,1.4572,6.5749,1.906,3.6864,5.05,1.6703,5.9573,7.2178,1.4046,0.8255,3.1986,5.5481,0.1381,1.4295,5.4407,1.3533,1.1284,3.3098,1.6476,0.3967,7.2432,0.8726,2.9836,5.3064,0.0218,0.8511,0.3862,2.7339,5.6782,0.9929,5.22,5.7786,3.1076,4.3035,4.7694,2.8924,5.4881,3.38,2.407,0.0099,0.0005,5.0304,1.7329,0.0136,1.2264,5.8358,5.5316,6.361,6.4527,4.1621,1.7312,1.7753,0.7962,2.2965,0.8127,5.3574,0.831,4.8526,0.3465,1.7274,0.2982,0.6,0.0002,1.1988,5.5249,1.3882,2.3698,0.102,4.8142,0.0021,0.4725,2.3669,5.1189,0.3165,3.5923,3.7835,4.6985,9.3275,0.7886,1.2129,3.1795,6.3713,3.9171,1.2674,1.8181,3.854,2.4859,0.492,0.6988,2.4708,3.8578,1.5325,5.9822,1.0545,6.2607,1.892,6.9514,4.8371,1.5431,3.245,1.7477,4.6642,3.2482,3.2561,0.0062,4.8005,2.6877,7.6015,5.525,2.454,1.1146,5.8243,2.2267,2.1221,6.6572,1.9867,2.6131,1.3548,3.2019,0.5704,1.2628,0.0002,1.2673,6.0558,0.3994,0.5042,2.9309,0.771,0.1758,5.2291,2.8428,4.4003,1.7382,2.7588,0.0776,2.4921,3.7617,2.7712,2.3969,2.4962,4.9177,3.9611,3.2693,6.1802,0.0036,1.0824,1.0665,0.0028,0.0012,0.0013,6.3206,1.8935,0.1615,8.9889,3.7237,3.929,0.0301,6.0446,0.0,0.4817,3.6857,1.3449,0.3599,5.3588,6.35,0.0001,0.3092,1.5381,3.1685,2.3721,4.7519,0.1753,0.7344,1.5473,3.966,6.4807,6.3793,4.0257,1.9799,3.0235,4.2645,3.4558,5.7235,0.0025,2.9167,0.4984,4.869,3.6218,0.1409,0.3244,3.947,1.511,5.1053,0.7434,0.5673]}
{"id":2812,"ended":true,"length":401,"text":"Inbreeding tends to occur in flocks of limited size and where only a single or a few rams are used. Associated with inbreeding is a decline in progeny performance usually referred to as inbreeding depression. Progeny performance can be measured by production of a given number of lambs, the amount of wool, or other qualities such as carcass quality or carcass value.\n\nInbreeding depression increases as the flock continues to be grown with the same parents resulting in a smaller population of rams from which to choose and thus, a loss in the ability to produce progeny of desired size, weight, and quality. Inbreeding depression is one of the main causes of low producer profitability.\n\nIn Australia, the effects of inbreeding depression have had a strong influence because farmers have been breeding sheep on small holding to improve performance. The breeding strategy in Australia is to produce a flock that maintains the health condition of a typical small scale flock. This has also provided an incentive for many farmers to breed the same parents and in most areas has resulted in a loss of genetic diversity.\n\nA new breeding stock selection and replacement system should be considered in Australia. As part of a breeding stock system, the first step is to define the criteria for breeding and selecting the new breeding stock. There is a need for a breeding index. A breeding index considers the economic as well as the environmental performance of an animal. In addition to the economic performance of the animal, there is also an environmental aspect. To this end, the animal should be able to perform on a wide array of forages of varying quality, and on a variety of environments.\n\nIn addition to selecting the characteristics of a new breeding stock, there is also a need to choose the appropriate management regime. It is possible to select the stock based on its genetic constitution, but it may be worthwhile selecting based on management choices.\n\nA new breeding stock selection system should incorporate the selection of genetic characteristics as well as the selection of the management regime. There is need for a breeding index which takes into consideration genetic values, animal management practices, and environment.","token_len":428,"entropy":[11.3552,6.7106,0.0179,2.487,1.2461,9.0821,0.1093,1.1584,9.4133,1.5455,1.4734,7.0436,5.0807,0.9578,3.4761,4.3198,3.0974,0.5754,9.009,3.775,1.0487,3.5301,1.0707,10.4219,0.6865,6.4955,0.0283,0.8286,1.5749,3.8702,0.0925,7.511,0.0466,9.5506,8.4261,4.6673,0.0101,0.0278,3.6627,0.2093,6.1156,0.5198,7.0028,1.1703,0.252,7.8043,2.9239,0.6327,3.8252,0.7468,9.3109,0.9399,2.7202,4.9981,0.9213,0.0094,7.0032,0.0054,2.9491,4.5319,3.8477,0.0873,5.18,2.973,1.5651,3.6753,5.9694,3.6843,0.001,8.9682,0.3008,3.0582,2.1761,4.4948,0.1532,5.3435,0.3399,2.1926,0.0006,2.4931,0.4482,2.1368,6.0053,3.5714,1.0604,4.969,6.2159,0.0994,2.7677,6.5553,5.3138,2.3728,2.017,5.6863,8.6841,0.0039,1.5036,4.0947,3.1097,2.1905,4.6333,0.0122,6.1637,1.7584,0.9605,3.3032,3.3561,3.8051,3.1267,2.1958,3.4252,1.8985,2.8083,2.5174,0.4533,2.5654,4.2416,0.0024,4.7317,7.0488,1.7045,3.082,2.4887,0.4801,1.3252,2.3123,0.1773,1.9883,0.3849,0.7268,1.5883,4.5392,0.1353,0.1875,2.0467,0.6218,0.0795,5.1698,11.0131,6.3163,1.3451,1.0487,0.0002,2.0088,8.7118,0.4329,1.8896,6.1723,0.0934,1.0431,0.0038,0.4217,2.3252,5.7081,1.0514,4.5265,1.3879,7.7937,6.1013,1.7016,1.3519,7.181,4.0107,4.064,4.5219,10.2995,6.1964,3.6124,4.9575,1.0166,2.2751,5.0131,6.094,4.0378,1.2976,1.3647,1.6775,3.7596,2.0143,3.117,2.6419,7.08,1.6477,6.5074,6.1253,0.5157,2.8646,5.8067,4.9866,8.4041,2.4647,1.6978,2.3933,3.8789,4.3693,5.5508,2.9624,2.6589,0.526,4.5333,1.4398,0.1158,3.0806,4.3219,1.6166,9.0199,2.316,4.4847,4.5025,5.3761,6.1516,1.6334,0.0017,1.2724,3.3666,0.503,6.3143,0.6996,1.0283,0.8467,0.0002,4.0305,4.5199,4.0885,6.9231,5.8388,5.6954,6.4257,3.8563,6.5306,0.2693,3.8262,1.9188,1.6797,1.5366,4.4666,4.748,0.0009,2.3714,3.9582,3.6653,3.5327,0.7144,1.7563,5.131,5.0812,1.4704,0.371,6.4351,1.1455,5.5804,0.6561,2.268,2.6195,4.94,1.5724,3.4563,2.9788,0.0247,0.6051,4.382,1.5839,1.195,2.8669,0.7354,1.1759,4.0357,8.2191,3.4448,2.2139,1.1918,0.1446,7.6834,0.7042,8.0138,7.8014,0.1075,0.0025,1.5462,2.3932,5.0865,0.2115,3.5677,1.8643,0.9519,3.1225,3.9121,1.4223,1.347,3.7818,1.2433,1.0098,1.0934,0.5858,0.2335,2.2612,0.9467,1.0648,1.9154,0.8509,5.6336,2.1402,4.9162,4.1105,0.225,0.185,1.3814,4.3582,1.936,0.3997,3.8104,0.0046,3.2574,3.9688,0.8419,3.7814,4.5201,0.0014,9.4797,2.7594,5.134,3.7728,2.6912,1.9801,2.949,4.6923,1.2232,1.7016,0.0021,5.192,0.7011,1.5655,0.0002,2.357,3.4582,0.4331,4.2482,0.8187,8.099,0.5048,2.1468,2.3741,0.9833,0.0114,0.3099,2.2195,1.1295,0.8732,0.6294,2.544,0.8163,5.0045,0.8542,3.3986,4.2795,5.767,1.2394,3.7917,0.316,3.646,0.4751,3.4313,2.064,4.4875,3.0474,0.0818,2.426,3.3678,6.5586,1.2652,2.117,2.158,4.201,0.9511,5.3287,7.2047,5.5287,0.0708,6.7348,5.845,1.2004,1.6743,0.0002,2.6897,2.3523,0.8237,0.1789,2.1786,1.3808,0.7274,6.9858,1.9974,3.9348,0.8763,4.9877,2.5375,3.4039,0.2687,0.0166,1.2829,2.5241,0.0394,2.5238,2.1633,1.6692,0.4429,3.8067,1.0079,5.4414,0.3268,0.4251,1.3949,0.0195,4.0598,4.9469,0.0557,1.8279,4.8189,6.512,1.822,5.7199,6.8131,2.9782,0.1821,0.9774,5.1008,0.9577]}
{"id":4617,"ended":true,"length":401,"text":"The King's Cross station part of the attraction is built on a site that previously held the Jaws attraction. The entrance to the station, which is a quarter @ - @ scale, takes visitors on a 30-second journey through the station, leading into the main lobby, the station itself @ - @ scale is a two floor building that contains a ticket office, ticket barriers and a shop. The roofed roof of the station @ - @ scale is home to many of the different creatures from the film, such as the shark, the great white. There are also numerous props and mementos and all of them play a part in the attraction's storyline. @ - @ scale trains are used throughout the attraction. The ride begins on the platform where riders watch a 10 minute film sequence as the story line picks up from the conclusion of the film - there are various scenes from the film re-enacted while the passengers make their way to the elevator which rises to the second level. After the ride ends, guests are welcomed into both a cafe area and the gift shop. @ - @ scale trains run through the station via a platform in the middle of the area, and then up a slight incline and to the exit. Guests can expect to wait five minutes for a train to take them up the hill. Guests exit the station via a drop as well as a staircase.\n\nKing's Cross is located in the London section of the resort at Disney theme parks in Florida. To get there, guests visit either of the two gates on the West side of the Magic Kingdom, which are close to Pirates of the Caribbean and on the North side of the Grand Floridian and the Grand Californian. Alternatively, guests can get to the ride by taking the exit to the left side of Pirates of the Caribbean. All of the transportation that goes to this area of the resort can be reached by walking along a walkway.\n\nFacts & Trivia\n\nThe King's Cross area was originally called \u201cHogwarts Crossing\u201d and will remain so even when the ride closes and the area is re-themed.","token_len":428,"entropy":[7.9496,1.7651,5.9817,8.0081,11.2367,1.0756,0.5266,8.0891,1.9523,4.7203,1.9123,1.4943,4.5027,1.9203,5.9884,3.9066,1.217,7.0853,4.8617,3.2252,0.9193,1.6856,4.8709,0.8459,0.2923,1.886,3.3628,1.2476,1.2743,3.3554,6.9165,16.5447,7.1472,5.3594,8.0791,0.561,5.856,3.3421,3.487,0.3548,4.9202,1.1537,3.7889,3.2217,1.193,1.0479,3.5633,2.3,4.8624,3.1966,0.9416,3.1245,4.2136,2.3672,3.0176,6.8163,3.6028,10.658,0.7315,0.1469,0.8834,5.0372,1.7679,5.0704,7.5878,2.7222,1.9202,3.9966,1.2199,8.1423,1.3495,0.8526,5.2485,9.8338,1.2277,1.2506,6.3198,0.8768,1.4657,7.1849,5.6962,3.9308,1.404,0.1282,1.6164,7.2187,0.3435,0.0125,0.1159,0.9097,5.7575,0.0377,4.7762,1.9071,0.1819,6.5508,8.2346,2.717,0.6989,3.6596,1.6683,2.3276,0.0013,1.2108,5.5801,0.7949,1.8072,7.0859,0.368,5.6722,3.5817,0.5961,0.678,3.8283,6.479,1.6195,6.5813,0.5553,0.2254,4.313,6.0248,1.6553,1.543,5.3809,1.0448,1.3507,0.1055,0.3005,0.9255,2.4681,4.9644,0.3067,8.495,0.1874,0.1495,0.1629,9.6222,2.1265,2.6964,3.0391,0.1328,0.743,1.988,1.4362,4.4836,3.3037,2.6306,1.0312,2.6702,3.7024,4.3168,7.7474,1.8732,7.4425,1.0469,3.1438,6.247,4.3004,1.5868,6.7369,6.9912,6.042,0.0166,3.8527,1.0605,7.9499,0.3593,0.438,0.815,5.9016,5.1844,0.5869,4.4318,4.3006,2.4124,0.4522,0.7738,8.7848,0.8481,0.9839,2.191,5.7443,1.0282,4.8207,5.9724,0.1241,0.077,1.2359,0.2966,5.3196,4.7411,5.718,1.0411,0.5334,4.2437,1.741,0.9946,4.0258,0.9739,1.4701,2.9447,0.6679,4.806,1.9006,4.2531,1.7301,9.3609,3.9116,5.8433,4.5464,0.5899,1.473,9.1085,0.1287,1.5276,3.9475,0.1323,0.258,0.1229,3.9791,3.5291,2.7298,0.3631,1.5892,5.2676,1.0851,4.2929,3.6716,0.5405,2.7171,0.3266,0.159,5.2652,2.0934,3.274,3.0645,4.4739,2.2834,7.5889,2.2142,0.0018,3.769,3.9222,0.3264,5.0991,1.3997,3.7239,1.236,6.9798,0.5872,3.5496,5.5418,0.1685,1.4469,1.5229,1.1564,0.6836,2.6192,0.0224,2.7639,1.8614,4.0956,1.6915,4.4622,7.671,0.6844,2.3785,1.8401,0.9179,5.5213,7.127,3.4171,0.5772,1.1413,3.1945,1.901,2.9882,0.0294,6.0917,0.1152,0.0167,2.1704,2.6565,1.2163,0.8569,6.2103,5.0643,0.019,0.6798,8.2416,3.6679,9.0991,6.4069,0.6518,2.9684,2.4581,1.0808,5.5537,2.3346,1.2056,0.4779,2.4132,6.4479,5.7609,4.4857,0.3836,2.9371,5.7971,2.321,0.2754,5.5136,2.3667,0.1511,0.1197,6.0627,0.0324,1.971,2.2368,1.2635,6.2463,0.3824,8.881,0.39,0.0032,0.0015,2.2382,6.1245,0.4712,3.0223,0.2485,0.1536,0.2696,5.3356,3.0819,0.0004,3.9712,2.5849,3.6653,5.7617,0.0447,1.0478,5.4256,0.0695,2.0146,0.2139,3.3634,1.1923,0.5969,4.9953,2.0979,2.5338,0.8551,5.0757,2.5882,0.4456,4.8737,2.9672,0.2194,7.5258,0.3228,0.0046,0.0038,1.7893,5.9822,1.2988,0.1717,9.0695,5.7039,2.9349,2.1883,4.461,3.5486,3.8439,0.2918,1.0794,2.927,0.1524,4.8915,1.1563,4.8637,2.4976,2.3103,4.9436,0.0283,2.4288,1.2617,0.0002,5.7349,5.0882,1.8044,4.9856,0.0439,0.6944,0.0002,1.3589,1.6816,0.0096,0.0014,5.7035,2.5161,1.7348,2.8479,11.242,7.2456,5.3491,5.0608,0.7076,7.879,0.9589,8.0582,1.7245,6.0925,2.462,0.8104,5.0134,3.2107,1.3719,4.6314,4.2231,4.3962,1.1706,4.9432,0.7169,2.2728,0.2281,4.7062,0.7994]}
{"id":993,"ended":true,"length":391,"text":"A tropical depression developed in the southern Gulf of Mexico at 1200 UTC on September 4. Six hours later, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Gladys. The storm quickly intensified and reached hurricane force on September 6. As it turned southward, Gladys lost its distinctive \"eye.\" Its forward speed decreased, causing its central barometric pressure to also drop. The storm weakened to tropical storm force on September 7, and later on September 8, the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) upgraded the storm to a Category 1 hurricane. Gladys moved westward and reached tropical storm force once more on September 9. At that time, the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km\/h) before weakening to tropical depression force the next day.\nThe final advisory was issued on September 11 at 0000 UTC. The NHC estimated Gladys had diminished back to tropical depression strength. As the storm crossed the Gulf of Mexico, it brought heavy rainfall to coastal Texas and Southwest Louisiana. The remnants of Gladys moved ashore in North Carolina and dissipated there late on September 13.\nMaximum sustained winds at the time of landfall were estimated to have been 40 mph (65 km\/h). Total rainfall along the track was estimated to be 2 to 3 inches (50 to 75 mm).\n\nTropical cyclone formation chances\n\nTropical cyclone formation probabilities (TPCFS) are shown in the table at the bottom of this product. They are based on the likelihood of formation as forecast by the NHC and updated daily. Forecasters monitor for formation of tropical cyclones when maximum sustained winds are at least 39 mph (63 km\/h). Once a system has the potential to form, it is tracked until it begins to dissipate, or until the NHC determines there is no longer a significant probability for future tropical cyclone formation. The actual number of tropical storms and hurricanes that form will vary as the intensity, track, and overall environment each season.\nThe NHC uses these numbers to determine which areas are likely to experience a higher chance of tropical cyclone impacts and issues advisories to these areas.","token_len":428,"entropy":[11.6242,4.1799,7.3941,1.1143,1.4673,4.4148,5.0378,0.2265,0.1429,4.478,10.1033,4.894,1.0359,2.941,3.3058,2.9847,8.2743,3.7016,0.3503,0.2536,2.1917,6.0757,2.909,5.4744,1.1035,8.4164,2.8698,1.6515,1.8185,1.6718,5.2678,4.345,1.8692,3.996,4.0285,4.417,4.3177,0.5422,2.2327,0.779,4.5571,2.1174,3.8676,1.9868,1.3339,0.3569,4.8377,0.0061,5.2909,2.1159,6.5003,4.0881,6.6702,3.9655,4.4452,7.4318,4.7946,3.2823,2.2156,4.715,2.8371,4.3644,7.8117,1.8506,0.2359,0.1599,7.8949,2.4136,0.7733,1.6216,2.6388,4.552,1.5832,3.2813,0.9697,1.5437,1.2327,0.2801,1.0749,1.3247,1.7639,5.1111,3.7626,1.9184,0.4513,1.2248,2.7152,6.5094,0.367,0.0083,2.6499,7.8221,0.0098,0.1047,5.9117,0.9586,1.4272,0.9888,2.4251,2.0069,2.7069,0.8094,0.7415,4.8423,0.0079,4.1743,2.6097,0.5914,2.5887,4.2919,4.1213,0.1452,0.0504,8.1419,0.9316,0.2698,0.2138,0.9599,0.2847,4.4009,1.9728,0.7456,0.1126,1.0963,1.9209,6.3085,3.7403,4.5951,0.651,0.1326,0.1574,4.6112,0.6055,1.6999,2.8728,0.5673,0.052,0.0038,0.9541,5.1109,2.2914,0.8561,1.0241,6.0865,1.3644,5.6269,2.5385,0.2509,0.2532,1.3817,4.8112,5.7116,7.7881,2.5473,0.4926,0.6016,0.457,1.4415,3.9618,11.5465,0.1055,0.6953,1.4106,3.0087,0.0041,5.0075,4.2128,0.0132,2.2457,8.2293,7.9929,0.4357,1.6197,0.841,3.8532,2.6063,3.747,1.5035,0.4606,5.7172,0.5207,2.4401,0.3616,0.024,0.7818,1.038,5.3976,4.0315,1.6379,1.0701,3.1644,6.2542,1.3019,6.3649,1.5356,0.6364,1.5831,6.499,0.0271,2.8472,0.0213,4.0463,5.9707,2.1241,4.9189,0.5605,1.445,10.9431,0.0015,5.7501,5.7741,1.4527,0.2755,1.8924,0.3339,1.3587,8.4219,0.4406,0.0853,3.4371,1.7549,0.3264,0.2627,2.6642,0.7199,5.7205,1.1961,2.6609,1.2323,4.4662,0.5333,0.0388,3.1809,0.0567,0.0049,0.0011,1.5229,6.7669,2.3825,6.2898,0.2865,8.2355,0.7963,0.8895,0.4608,1.5957,3.7403,3.8632,0.9688,0.4209,0.0848,4.7123,0.2976,2.4304,1.3066,0.9655,1.5005,7.225,5.6999,0.4812,0.0132,4.2652,0.3505,6.8542,13.136,1.3317,0.007,2.8262,0.0058,0.0031,0.7283,0.4287,0.1899,2.4015,2.3568,1.3514,3.3918,11.614,0.2212,0.8384,5.2362,0.5245,2.1627,2.14,4.0543,0.7507,1.9521,0.1,0.198,10.1155,0.2952,2.8731,0.801,1.0653,0.0535,0.874,3.6093,0.6404,5.405,4.608,6.7529,2.7948,0.8212,1.2352,0.0271,1.9284,6.5504,3.8398,1.9239,6.3437,2.3109,7.4896,4.03,6.0881,3.8825,1.031,0.1557,0.2852,4.4314,8.3002,0.6745,0.1068,1.7866,2.7794,1.3504,6.4258,0.2006,0.05,4.7862,0.1617,0.0055,0.0032,0.9334,6.5919,1.203,6.4946,0.9825,6.6031,1.504,0.3997,1.6371,0.6897,0.8871,1.1857,7.8989,4.9516,0.7518,5.1663,0.5423,4.4101,0.0008,2.5716,2.5359,0.9535,1.5906,5.4997,0.0018,2.743,3.7847,0.3215,0.8959,2.3363,0.5034,4.1428,3.7283,3.0514,4.5891,3.0995,0.1475,0.3012,0.0787,0.1509,2.1592,5.8772,2.5756,0.1213,1.1525,4.0056,4.2109,2.7898,1.9609,1.1738,3.6267,1.2954,4.4751,0.8582,5.5787,3.9288,6.9295,2.4789,0.2207,5.7465,7.9728,8.0791,4.9995,2.3292,0.9048,12.9138,1.7897,0.0032,3.861,3.8522,4.6364,0.2819,1.9216,2.9201,5.506,1.4436,2.0815,0.0248,2.1995,1.9644,5.5334,3.7595,0.1158,2.0036,0.081,0.0599,11.344,3.4768,9.6833,13.2321,0.0058,3.6573,6.0862,0.2293,0.4156]}
{"id":1469,"ended":true,"length":362,"text":"Several portions of modern NY 38 were originally part of turnpikes and plank roads during the 1800s. On April 13, 1819, the New York State Legislature passed a law incorporating the Cortland Plank Road, known as Turnpike. The first road commission was established in 1823. It extended the turnpike from a small settlement off of present-day West Main Street in Cortland, to an opening at the confluence of the Cortland and Cayuga lakes. By the 1830s, the name was changed to the New York State Railroad and Canal Turnpike.\n\nThe NY 38 and turnpike was later opened to traffic in 1845. From 1849 until 1853, the NY 38 was built from the eastern terminus at the NY 28 in Cortland to the old Erie Railroad station in downtown Elmira NY. The west side was opened to traffic in 1855. By the late 1850s, the New York State Railroad and Canal Turnpike was the busiest road and had the highest tolls in New York State. The NY 38 followed the original route of the NY 28 and was part of the original Erie Canal. The NY 38 has had several names over the years. In 1860, the New York State Railroad and Canals Turnpike became the New York Central Railroad and Lackawanna Railroad\n\nBy the 1890s, the NY 38 had been leased to the New York Central Railroad where it was named the Old Cortland Turnpike. The NY 38 was extended to Elmira in 1895. Between 1902 and 1914, the Old Cortland Turnpike was extended to Canajoharie and eventually became part of U.S. Route 20. The turnpike was finally replaced with the present US 20 in 1927. In the 1930s, the NY 38 was rebuilt to modern standards and was finally paved in 1961. Since the 1930s, the NY 38 has been part of the U.S. Highway 20, which is known as the Adirondack Bypass. NY 38 ends at Interstate 87 in northern New York State along the border with Ontario County.","token_len":429,"entropy":[9.1468,0.1926,9.2799,9.5883,12.247,3.0767,4.9849,5.3165,0.0076,11.5357,1.9066,3.8565,2.1168,12.1876,3.7485,6.357,0.343,3.938,0.383,0.8762,6.3064,5.8016,3.8138,0.2729,2.1365,3.6283,0.1006,1.4755,3.3692,0.0474,1.5775,1.8644,0.9157,1.0174,0.8064,7.2083,1.3647,13.4958,1.4748,9.3749,0.5565,0.515,2.4792,5.2038,0.2927,5.2032,0.035,0.0766,5.8844,1.4907,3.6355,4.379,13.0375,2.1669,1.8065,0.5246,0.5659,4.0721,1.4592,3.2217,5.8196,1.0608,3.1809,0.0205,0.0084,1.5247,4.4727,4.046,6.0589,5.6324,2.8609,10.5488,0.6985,0.0136,4.4769,4.6628,0.0893,2.4417,6.4392,0.0029,2.1512,0.8305,3.7226,6.8172,2.581,1.72,7.48,0.0039,0.0726,1.6729,2.6706,0.0116,0.7101,9.4155,0.3252,6.4224,0.7263,3.9101,2.0677,3.5602,0.0425,0.399,1.2563,6.7863,2.6297,1.9113,0.1954,2.251,3.1952,0.3936,0.8483,4.3055,2.5871,8.0208,8.9627,0.0119,0.0472,0.5784,2.0061,0.0046,1.4963,6.6557,0.5161,4.624,2.9234,0.0091,0.1344,4.3499,4.7909,5.3329,0.9322,1.5826,2.1443,1.5119,3.4669,1.032,4.5867,1.4132,2.6667,1.7202,1.7087,2.2995,0.1732,1.1771,3.8404,0.186,1.2249,4.1737,3.6159,1.7461,5.9146,4.562,0.016,4.4021,1.3274,6.9072,5.4218,2.9041,3.5778,0.0021,1.9791,0.4666,6.0279,6.2506,4.6353,3.4514,2.4296,5.8451,8.3232,1.4681,8.208,0.4255,1.1406,7.1254,2.5804,2.8651,3.0048,1.0116,0.3573,0.7396,0.6284,2.4165,1.0877,3.5058,1.146,2.3413,2.1657,0.0563,0.1648,0.6406,3.271,0.0215,0.3194,1.7943,2.6743,0.3149,0.6065,0.0016,0.0072,1.9049,2.8302,3.5005,2.4524,4.9957,4.8575,2.1751,1.7987,2.8746,1.4377,1.644,2.2299,0.0257,1.7155,1.295,1.7043,3.0679,0.1071,7.4739,0.8084,3.8284,3.0814,0.8615,0.5628,2.0195,0.9001,2.281,2.1123,4.7266,0.0029,0.4862,3.7885,4.1824,2.384,2.1882,1.4857,2.4887,0.1549,4.2936,4.1561,3.3959,6.6781,3.6172,0.087,0.2339,1.8372,3.3036,4.4505,0.3317,0.7621,2.2447,0.0319,0.1482,1.4601,1.0143,8.5942,0.2707,1.4782,0.0052,0.0041,2.9728,0.5542,2.8364,0.048,7.2045,2.4062,1.5307,9.0783,0.3273,0.0011,3.8334,7.0494,0.0003,4.2528,0.8208,3.7203,0.0348,0.1438,0.466,1.264,0.1262,2.0423,1.6261,7.4075,0.8868,0.9301,2.1124,0.1409,3.0226,0.207,7.5079,0.3874,1.3453,4.501,1.4133,5.2719,5.9623,0.0032,1.9343,0.0096,0.0023,0.7848,1.3312,2.3851,0.1667,1.1564,5.2244,0.5887,7.1177,0.0006,3.2005,3.5043,1.6414,4.9998,3.9807,0.0756,4.9918,0.1866,0.5785,4.6146,0.1339,0.001,0.1872,0.0016,0.0016,0.8883,2.4656,0.5003,8.2014,11.7568,4.3045,1.0455,2.2362,6.2301,3.5389,3.2845,0.0006,7.5433,0.5739,0.0168,0.0247,1.7353,5.0876,0.8492,1.5333,3.7334,0.0419,0.014,0.941,5.5762,5.2911,2.7178,0.5945,6.6134,6.4232,5.1526,1.7618,5.0599,0.3461,2.9567,2.3297,2.0407,0.0524,0.1344,0.4339,1.411,0.154,0.6508,4.9465,1.9038,6.0396,2.2735,1.5208,2.1932,4.8684,6.733,1.6275,4.8182,0.2349,4.9333,1.4453,4.7132,0.0106,0.1259,0.5147,0.9304,0.0692,0.2491,0.7414,2.906,0.0013,0.6932,4.6971,0.0015,0.0014,0.0362,4.1212,4.7223,2.9782,2.2867,1.7647,4.6337,0.1901,0.8321,8.9044,0.288,0.0001,0.877,9.8454,0.4233,0.3928,6.2459,0.159,7.0838,0.5357,5.2277,6.4272,1.1603,6.3139,1.0143,0.464,1.6904,5.0122,0.7684,5.9319,0.9181,5.3279,4.804,0.7014]}
{"id":1746,"ended":true,"length":376,"text":"Regional variants of the word Allah occur in both pagan and Christian pre @ - @ Islamic inscriptions. Different theories have been proposed regarding the role of Allah in pre @ - @ Islamic inscriptions [Kahn, 1984, p. 38]. First, it has been suggested that the word Allah has an Arabic history meaning a word belonging to a category of related, if not identical, words [A. A. K. Khan, \"The Place of the Qur'an in the Persian Text: An Enquiry into the Concept of the Qur'an in Its Early Stage,\" in Early Semitic and Arabic Religious Texts: Problems of Form and Meaning, edited by A. A. K. Kahn (New York, London, Toronto, Los Angeles 1965), p. 719] as in Greek. This would have applied to the word Allah as it was used at this time, which presumably was identical to the word Allah which appeared in the Old Testament.\n\n\"Allah is the same as Adan in Greek or Adam in Latin, which may have been borrowed from Babylonian Akkadian \"lm \" or \"lum,\" according to E. H. A. Richards [1964, p. 41]. Another theory is that the word Allah, as it appears in the Islamic texts, derived from a root meaning \"all-seeing\" [Khan, 1985, p. 453] or \"all-knowing\" [Khan, 1984, p. 38]. See also: \"Allah: The Meaning of Religion's Most Powerful Name\" by Robert Alter pp 6-12.\n\n2.

{"id":604,"ended":true,"length":397,"text":"The speaker's language is unadorned but forceful, and it expresses Ulysses'conflicting moods as he searches for continuity between his past and future. There is often a marked contrast between the present and the past in the speech itself. Although Ulysses'words are \"straight-forward and unvarnished, they are also rich with detail and full of vivid imagery.\n\nIn \"A Memory of Things Past\" for instance, the speaker mentions the smell of jasmine and the sound of a sea breeze in the next line, while in the next line he is reminded of the smell of the pears and smell of the water \"of the sea's surface\" (line 37). Later (line 42), he is aware of the movement in the air. In the same poem, the speaker remembers the first person's conversation in his bedroom and the sound of \"the waves of water \" (line 26).\n\nHe also mentions the sound of the wind in the next stanza (line 33), and finally (line 49), the sensation of touch in the moment of physical death (although that may have been something he had dreamt, or had been influenced by his wife's description to him).\n\nWe see similar contrasts of mood in other poems like \"On the Island\", \"The Dead,\" \"The Cockroach\" and \"The Second Person\".\n\nWhile Ulysses is at sea, the speaker appears to represent the \"old man's gaze... whose eyes are unclouded and his thoughts unconcerned.\n\n... the mind of the old man which is free from all fear of the future or of the past\" (line 7).\n\nThere is certainly a difference between the speaker as the old man and the old man.\n\nThe young man is anxious, and worried that this voyage might turn out to be a fool's errand, as well as the old man who sees the voyage like \"a thing done\" and \"an end of time\" for him (lines 23 and 38 respectively), although the older man did not have his memories to comfort him.","token_len":430,"entropy":[9.8166,2.6583,6.5651,1.3103,6.1718,5.0657,0.5527,3.6601,5.9699,1.3563,1.7881,2.8649,5.3415,9.9553,3.0855,0.0,0.5794,17.5105,4.5544,0.0032,6.5026,1.0527,3.6371,0.6324,6.5916,0.2567,9.9598,2.2404,1.3349,3.4689,0.3136,3.3774,0.4366,4.8419,1.1172,5.2604,0.9221,6.5793,2.787,0.2079,1.2611,5.95,0.4117,0.3418,0.6101,2.926,1.4466,4.0351,4.1884,1.5834,5.4327,2.6564,0.0003,0.0005,2.5093,11.5427,0.9814,5.554,6.5305,3.0832,0.3374,2.3257,3.9168,7.1532,0.1436,0.005,3.7919,1.5525,1.1723,2.9618,6.2483,1.8297,3.5083,0.922,6.26,0.0482,4.9299,2.9109,3.1043,4.3688,0.0038,3.3785,3.4335,3.2783,5.4581,0.5789,4.8378,1.1418,2.1444,6.4992,4.1252,0.0665,1.6581,2.0789,6.0223,1.775,7.9641,0.0928,7.6469,0.3665,0.0065,1.79,1.1117,3.8169,0.0224,2.3892,7.1514,2.7547,3.0886,1.3636,5.8445,1.9644,1.8216,3.1302,2.1812,2.0756,2.188,0.587,0.7853,3.6592,3.2238,0.2236,0.9997,2.5243,0.0299,2.7201,6.0922,3.46,2.1514,6.3005,0.0697,1.7658,4.9101,6.0873,1.1078,1.3165,2.5559,4.5586,4.1491,2.8397,2.0933,9.1826,4.836,0.2732,6.2256,6.2015,1.1287,3.6393,0.6347,1.4772,2.0097,5.2917,0.441,0.5425,7.3216,4.3781,0.5489,2.1753,4.0472,2.0778,1.8632,2.9855,4.9853,0.3616,1.4784,0.9366,6.6048,1.1487,5.1204,5.2287,4.1953,5.4315,2.9966,2.4564,4.8786,2.5818,1.4836,3.0536,0.0715,4.4185,1.3082,4.1854,1.291,4.0352,6.0665,1.2075,0.2137,5.3022,0.2228,1.4225,0.0002,5.0446,1.9404,1.9547,0.9212,2.745,0.0359,1.2581,2.7871,1.6355,0.7405,0.5611,7.8232,0.0129,2.0306,0.2969,3.6834,1.5366,1.778,5.8709,3.2032,0.066,5.3627,1.0594,2.082,6.6514,0.2121,5.8411,1.1795,0.322,5.9555,1.0603,6.7699,5.39,0.9215,9.4589,4.7593,3.7187,1.8652,0.606,5.0627,1.4979,1.8179,6.7695,0.0044,4.3601,2.1874,3.7352,2.3098,5.0198,0.0941,2.8828,6.1713,0.8809,6.4939,5.8511,1.5435,1.3669,1.3228,0.0001,5.3267,3.6566,4.5076,3.1893,5.0005,3.7636,1.4991,3.2271,3.0408,4.5762,0.5831,5.5175,0.8431,5.5783,3.1464,0.8563,1.7391,6.7307,5.3222,0.8716,1.4975,9.709,2.0092,1.7667,0.2555,0.5714,1.3629,7.1444,5.6136,1.3044,1.8718,0.0001,5.2501,3.1956,0.0008,0.0003,2.0646,5.0768,5.0598,0.6722,1.941,2.7468,5.3635,0.7739,8.3608,1.3876,3.6771,5.1426,2.129,2.3997,7.6807,8.1052,7.1699,2.4189,1.5363,5.791,4.2789,0.0157,2.0979,2.7836,4.8955,6.0597,1.9048,2.5856,2.5807,0.0002,5.7537,3.9769,5.4142,1.6869,1.2913,1.6451,0.0725,5.2432,1.431,6.0418,0.7439,2.9184,3.4041,3.261,1.8039,2.3272,4.5662,0.8884,1.1328,2.2206,2.7465,0.1629,1.92,5.3272,0.3579,0.6179,0.0002,4.0092,0.7732,5.5087,0.9966,3.032,0.3975,1.1857,4.2293,6.5367,2.8737,3.8953,0.0364,0.5539,0.6643,4.3439,0.1917,4.5154,2.1379,0.0002,2.1819,4.9798,0.1826,1.4457,8.1205,2.1551,2.3774,6.4161,2.7099,4.8892,7.3274,2.2681,4.0346,0.7059,0.895,0.0689,1.2808,6.1461,0.095,0.0292,0.0004,1.3778,3.5943,3.5672,0.0213,2.9387,1.798,0.0277,1.9824,4.2654,1.6703,4.7571,5.7044,4.6612,1.0563,6.9237,5.1126,4.503,2.2409,1.8748,3.5821,4.5446,2.5902,4.0347,1.3655,5.3141,1.386,1.661,2.1594,3.9027,1.7333,5.1359,6.3714,3.0558,4.9129,1.7868,4.1552,0.2906,7.0681,0.2419,3.9891,3.7922,5.9493,4.3642,8.2218,0.1548,0.8979]}
{"id":2959,"ended":true,"length":419,"text":"Quantum mechanics introduces an important change in the way probabilities are computed. Probabilities are still represented by the usual real numbers we use for probabilities in our everyday world, but probabilities are computed by the laws of quantum mechanics. The probabilities are no longer independent and can be combined to form the probabilities of different outcomes. One of the most famous examples of this is the case of the quantum mechanic's \"many worlds\" hypothesis (more correctly speaking \"multiverse\" hypothesis). Quantum mechanics predicts the universe has at least as much different copies of you, in different universes. There are as many different versions of you as there are atoms in the universe. That means you have as many copies of yourself as atoms in the universe (one per atom).\n\nBut there are also as many different probabilities for each version. There are not as many different versions of you in other universes as there are atoms in the universe. You may think \"how much more probable is that there be an extra duplicate of me in another universe than that there will be atom in the universe?\" However you have to think about probabilities. The extra chance there is to have an extra duplicate in another universe depends on what other universe you have compared to the same amount of atom in our universe (for instance the probability of have an extra me in a universe where everything is exactly the same as in ours will be 1\/2 as high as the probability of have an extra me in a universe where everything is slightly different than in ours). But the extra chance of other universes is of course not measured, because this probability is not measured.\n\nSo when you talk about probabilities you have to make assumptions that might or might not be a valid. There is no standard probability theory to compare to. However by the way probabilities can be combined to form a probabilistic sum, such probability also may be compared to standard probabilities.\n\nThis is the example of a standard probability.\n\nA typical probability sum would be like this, where the sum of individual probabilities of each outcome can be replaced by a probability sum representing the chance that the sum of the individual probability of each outcome is 1.","token_len":430,"entropy":[5.6773,5.1564,7.7787,2.7933,2.5696,5.3074,0.8964,0.8687,1.8664,7.6283,0.4843,2.8642,0.9684,4.5364,1.3042,0.7433,6.7819,3.8935,1.2239,2.263,5.5827,7.9145,0.9909,6.8188,2.0021,1.6996,2.9424,2.8548,3.0274,4.314,2.6521,1.2583,0.5145,3.8653,0.6814,3.7266,1.9543,1.9007,4.7042,0.073,1.8177,0.0798,0.7155,2.2414,4.3941,1.7447,5.4608,0.0248,5.6415,4.4699,1.729,0.3506,4.1801,1.4592,1.2921,2.4109,2.9332,0.7659,3.3778,2.1679,0.5134,5.3235,2.1165,0.1239,1.8781,3.7699,1.186,0.4784,0.7466,0.7154,0.8826,4.144,0.3131,1.5463,4.7124,7.1997,5.1219,3.213,7.7727,3.764,0.9379,4.2994,3.677,6.3142,6.3104,9.5909,2.5141,6.0507,0.0959,2.4694,2.7078,0.5732,3.8084,0.0441,5.0154,2.001,4.4889,5.2015,4.2079,0.1468,4.9622,4.2453,7.2471,9.2013,0.1951,7.5992,3.7469,4.2453,3.3928,2.1203,1.0163,4.6046,0.6715,6.167,0.0551,1.9498,2.6509,0.0634,0.1842,0.5172,0.0885,0.0439,4.9283,1.009,0.6849,0.6451,0.5684,4.7813,2.0383,3.1389,1.9158,3.6693,0.0891,1.8979,0.2428,2.495,0.2002,4.1678,0.3077,0.5674,0.3746,3.8484,5.4504,4.989,1.3029,0.8764,2.6907,0.0066,3.6573,2.5365,0.7929,1.7701,5.1819,0.0144,0.7643,5.5852,2.129,1.6028,2.5454,3.5182,3.5192,0.3788,4.7944,1.8278,0.0071,1.0231,1.0789,0.3123,0.5825,2.8272,6.6874,0.1687,1.5921,0.0965,0.0211,2.2249,0.0587,0.0921,0.0598,0.2653,4.4106,2.8348,3.1407,4.1911,4.7693,3.519,1.5505,5.2969,0.6999,1.4861,3.7745,6.9405,4.203,3.481,7.7201,0.7273,0.9141,1.7277,2.9104,0.3534,1.6989,3.6914,0.6471,3.9788,0.1167,9.8889,1.4712,0.9265,1.0809,2.0723,3.5411,4.4705,4.3882,2.0076,2.6054,0.9722,2.8688,1.7328,2.6219,6.1516,5.655,4.8358,0.5798,3.5573,1.211,0.996,0.0798,2.5203,2.363,0.6828,0.1003,5.8232,0.279,2.6305,4.0163,3.5696,0.7253,2.0331,6.2795,0.8624,1.3101,3.7576,5.4745,0.1232,4.6125,0.2652,7.4067,0.6937,2.908,3.3378,2.1824,4.1048,4.326,1.1057,7.3623,1.1368,0.0974,8.8323,0.5557,1.5773,2.9901,3.2256,5.9811,0.6141,4.9671,0.5602,0.0054,2.8959,1.5261,4.1211,5.2904,0.7105,2.6793,1.3324,1.3196,2.5656,3.6949,0.6429,1.1516,0.5446,0.3642,0.5436,0.1931,0.0595,0.7511,0.0807,0.5042,0.136,0.188,0.4687,0.0986,6.1771,0.2565,2.3773,0.9267,0.0668,0.5738,4.2128,2.3477,1.4523,0.4114,1.8568,8.3052,0.2408,3.0936,6.3426,2.4536,1.9878,7.8971,3.7041,1.9827,4.4099,3.1987,0.7461,2.0474,2.6781,2.0566,1.5486,0.0002,2.4831,3.9476,1.1243,5.3813,0.1083,0.6755,1.9676,3.0062,0.4766,3.8199,3.6035,3.45,5.2349,5.0037,0.0638,0.0014,0.8006,6.751,4.2279,7.5672,3.8218,1.3953,0.8648,4.3559,6.3042,4.3959,2.5521,4.6854,3.1394,1.2365,4.0817,6.4452,2.9635,2.486,3.1699,2.3453,0.5473,3.5707,0.7825,0.078,1.9897,5.6662,0.0206,0.0088,7.0785,1.9177,4.7204,8.6869,6.3594,5.3229,0.9677,3.3827,0.2838,6.1,1.8503,0.7945,1.7335,0.0002,3.834,1.0434,2.405,6.3993,0.7487,1.7362,5.1849,0.7916,3.1941,2.7201,0.0001,3.4661,3.7318,0.9471,5.8919,4.1701,0.4597,4.5904,0.6288,3.9627,1.5417,1.6234,3.1776,0.6362,7.4711,0.3361,3.3057,3.3137,2.0277,4.1443,0.1374,6.7401,0.2741,1.0052,2.0283,2.0973,5.7346,0.7482,5.3058,1.3876,1.541,3.9391,1.2547,1.6607,1.3806,3.7761,2.5778,0.7955,0.1006,1.647,4.2871,1.7188]}
{"id":4409,"ended":true,"length":397,"text":"The Crimes Act prescribed death as the exclusive punishment for the crimes of treason, counterfeiting, wilfull murder, and aiding the escape of a death row prisoner, as well as piracy, piracy within British territory, and piracy committed by privateers. Treason was defined as being, \"A conviction by any court of record, of any person of having, by, with, or on behalf of the Crown any treasonable connection, or of communicating, plotting, or conspiring with a person with a treasonable connection, against the honour and good faith of this realm.\n\nThe Crimes Act, 1858 and the new Criminal Justice Act of 1869 created a new offence of conspiracy to commit high treason which was punishable by death.\n\nThe Treason Act also specified that the offences of treason and high treason as defined in the 1852 Criminal Law Consolidation Act were to be \"considered as triable by a jury of twelve men\", and that the trial should be in the King's Bench (the most powerful and most prestigious court in England); there would be no more than one trial per case. Prior to 1858, only the House of Lords had the power or authority to try these offences, and there were several charges relating to high treason in the 1640s and 1660s that were tried in the Privy Council\n\nBy the 1920s, more than 300 people had been charged under the 1702 Treason Act, although almost all these had been dropped due to being of too low a level of importance. The last charge was dropped in 1936, only nine years after the Treason Act had ceased to have force. On that occasion the Attorney General had considered the case of the Fleet Solidarity movement and decided that the prosecution was unjustified, and would therefore take no further action. However, the last recorded case of treason being successfully made under the 1702 Act was the 1918 indictment of Peter Devereux and Joseph Murphy, for plotting to overthrow the King and the Government. This was dropped due to insufficient evidence and no further charges were ever made.

{"id":81,"ended":true,"length":384,"text":"The west wing, entered through the main cave, is in a semi @ - @ ruined state. It has a small chapel and a cistern enclosed within the pillared cave, which is the center of the shrine. The south doorway of the chapel leading into the main cave is flanked by two massive statues, while the north doorway is barred by a stone grille.\n\nA well-preserved shrine complex (ca. 800 - 12th century CE) with many votive offerings has existed for a long time in the vicinity, dating back to the early Iron Age (1200-800 BC). At that time, the complex had one large shrine connected to the cave. Over the centuries, the cave grew in size and functioned as a shrine complex until it came to a ruinous state. The shrine was probably abandoned after its collapse. The cave was used as a storage place until the 19th century. In 1954, the site was first excavated by the University of Chicago archeologist Henry F. Kiesling, who described the shrine complex and discovered a small altar in the cave. He suggested that the cave was used as a storage place for votive offerings. A series of cave tombs and burials in the vicinity (ca. the 16th century) are believed to be associated with this shrine. The cave shrine was probably restored as part of the early Christian pilgrimage to the Holy Land (ca. the 3rd century), at the same time that a Christian chapel was built in the cave and served as an abbot\u2019s seat. During the Crusader period (ca. 10th-12th century), the cave and shrine were looted and then served as a basecamp by the Mamluks.

{"id":3734,"ended":true,"length":406,"text":"The Comet appears in the sky, and Azula's coronation takes place. Azula banishes nearly all of her subjects ( including her Dai Li agents ) in fear of betrayal, haunted by her failure at the North Pole. The Comet arrives, and a month into the month, the Avatar lands at the Southern Water Tribe, a year after she had first been captured, and reunites with Zuko. She finds her brother on her new throne, and the comet begins to shine brightly. She has gained a significant advantage over the avatar, she realizes, and is now very confident of her victory, if only by force of will. She demands that Zuko kill her, but Zuko only tells her that if she had never betrayed him, that he had never lost her and everything else in his life. With all those he had ever cared for laid at his feet, Azula decides to retreat. The comet passes a few days after the Avatar's retreat, and Azula returns to Republic City, the seat of Fire Lord Ozai's government. Azula has discovered that Ozai has ordered all of his agents to betray him should he give in to Azula's demands. A series of attacks, some orchestrated to fail, begin to take place in the city, as Ozai realizes how much his agents loathe her, while Azula learns what her brother is capable of. She sends fire ships into Republic City, and attempts to use the comet to increase her power. Ozai tells her that while he is powerless against her, he is not willing to give in to her, and that she will have to attack his agents on her own terms. When the comet appears a third time, Ozai sends the Earth Kingdom in to protect the city. Azula escapes and the comet passes. Ozai then releases Ty Lee into the city to aid in the defense, but Azula is nowhere to be found. Ozai sees the comet one final time, and decides to return to the Southern Water Tribe with his family.

{"id":1143,"ended":true,"length":394,"text":"Dennis Feldman had the idea for Species in 1987, as he worked on another film about an alien invasion, Real Men. Having read an article by Arthur C. Clarke about the insurmountable distance between earth and the Moon, Feldman thought that if he wrote a script about an inter-planetary species that had invaded Earth, he could have an adventure on-Earth, too.\n\nIn spite of the fact that Feldman was working on a thriller called The Alien Game, with a plot revolving around a game invented by one of the invaders, the film ended up being very different.\n\nThe creature on the cover of the first comic book was simply a bipedal robot. Feldman also decided to keep the extraterrestrials from the film human, as he preferred them.\n\nThe only character to appear twice in the comic book was Kip Hansen, a scientist who was working for the space program. He was also the first victim of the alien, but he was saved in the end by Jessica.\n\nFilmmaking company\n\nAs a result of working on the script for Species, Feldman and his wife Barbara wanted to start a company where scientists, writers and other artists could have an opportunity to work together in movies. At first they wanted to call it The Creature Shop, as they were inspired by the Creature Shop that was created in Los Angeles in 1927. The main difference between their company and the classic creature shop was that although the original members had been inspired by Universal Monsters and sci-fi movies of the \u201930s, this new shop would only focus on horror movies. Barbara Feldman had to convince the film department of Columbia Pictures, where she had a job as a secretary, to give her husband permission to start the new company.\n\nAfter the first issue, the company was renamed D.F. Films and soon began work on producing a series of comic books based on horror movies. After the first four issues, Barbara died. Dennis Feldman continued to work with the company and even had another movie produced, The Banned. He also wrote a script for a television movie called The Alien Abductions.","token_len":432,"entropy":[10.0946,10.5164,6.0745,3.3533,5.4331,1.4255,12.7557,3.6704,6.3057,1.0927,4.5807,1.8472,4.0384,0.7778,5.3517,2.9642,2.315,3.2167,1.7435,3.8537,2.6367,8.9532,3.7834,0.9506,7.0356,3.6969,4.6317,1.6069,2.0562,5.5479,1.8032,0.0853,0.0252,1.6747,1.3465,13.0074,0.1381,0.0065,7.1074,0.5551,7.013,0.0985,1.3288,3.3614,0.4013,0.9291,3.0562,1.9639,3.677,1.2535,4.9867,1.1555,4.1249,2.2393,2.5687,6.2846,4.3961,1.6038,0.0004,4.2237,2.5993,3.0624,5.6211,0.3843,0.8569,1.148,1.1814,3.6593,3.0976,6.1885,3.3273,6.2441,6.0443,2.8071,3.7565,0.2044,1.0595,0.0008,2.8365,7.2052,0.0087,1.6477,2.0731,0.0482,3.6476,1.8588,3.5005,0.3239,1.1908,6.3162,2.7166,2.2819,4.4182,7.0593,0.4422,5.7096,2.8374,4.374,5.3631,0.0088,1.3144,6.7118,8.413,0.1185,4.5576,0.3296,1.07,8.2207,0.4175,2.168,2.9682,4.0567,0.2974,0.9259,4.4085,2.1926,1.8981,2.9086,0.0001,2.4133,6.554,4.5733,0.7846,2.3631,1.308,1.0862,2.7266,6.6069,1.7407,1.9035,5.4734,1.0393,6.6104,0.0074,0.0209,3.6736,2.1212,3.8216,4.7243,4.4028,0.5642,5.2027,0.7824,6.9687,2.9553,0.003,0.0006,2.2583,2.612,2.1843,10.7821,2.1682,2.2575,1.6661,6.1815,3.2701,4.4366,1.4436,0.0001,2.0112,4.8884,4.1667,2.8457,1.5962,6.8048,0.6102,0.311,3.158,1.4447,0.453,5.6157,3.9296,6.9511,0.5112,1.9868,3.8792,0.8679,1.7846,3.7354,2.0207,0.9476,5.7401,1.9837,1.3672,1.9409,1.1218,2.8507,1.7961,2.6942,8.1059,0.074,1.023,1.8459,7.4617,3.4922,1.7953,1.2785,2.5111,3.5769,0.8103,1.4946,0.2429,9.9454,5.5132,0.6816,0.0001,4.515,3.3648,2.2433,7.6919,4.6795,0.0002,4.8328,1.8569,2.226,0.1576,4.9858,0.4767,1.2025,4.4731,0.9877,3.8855,2.9121,0.8325,3.2541,1.1009,2.0692,5.0631,5.1773,0.2336,3.8935,0.9434,1.7573,5.8502,4.5612,3.7441,3.6921,0.9402,3.7205,3.269,0.5972,5.2473,2.5544,2.0146,0.0177,1.3908,2.157,3.053,5.7612,0.911,5.0299,2.3995,2.1975,2.9892,0.3722,5.3789,0.3972,3.3153,5.161,3.2079,0.4835,3.0574,1.991,1.7886,5.0232,0.1308,1.0032,3.9782,0.1,4.0593,1.7592,2.0693,1.5629,4.6989,0.0115,1.7955,6.3706,1.0893,2.1104,5.2715,2.3993,0.7867,3.52,1.4577,0.5549,0.7921,8.2233,5.2667,0.1585,0.6325,0.4981,6.4627,1.276,3.8002,7.7652,2.3304,2.0785,4.8731,0.1202,7.38,5.3155,2.0741,9.2693,0.0121,0.0011,2.2081,4.1982,0.1401,15.6887,8.3003,5.9661,0.5169,0.8596,4.8491,4.2311,7.3476,2.7473,4.5729,3.4561,0.0546,4.8373,2.1028,0.8173,6.3129,2.4279,3.0751,3.7952,4.6003,1.6989,4.5633,5.1774,2.4727,10.3268,0.5815,2.0636,4.3691,0.4885,1.7433,3.4718,4.9929,1.2093,0.8182,5.5323,1.4218,0.4167,2.9918,0.6671,8.8175,2.742,0.048,3.2493,1.2119,3.8121,1.2991,0.3592,0.7178,0.0001,3.4073,1.7438,3.1812,4.4302,2.0049,1.4594,2.1326,1.8613,2.3499,7.5281,2.7419,3.7155,0.1474,4.3712,1.8282,5.0142,2.786,3.4235,0.0916,6.195,3.203,2.0876,0.0704,4.9643,0.4487,1.9467,0.1139,7.445,1.6368,0.5957,3.7306,1.4455,1.8067,5.5881,0.3008,0.789,5.6634,5.4696,1.9717,7.8202,1.019,3.6137,0.9253,0.7457,3.1691,1.2081,0.9998,2.1337,5.0337,3.3543,4.2912,4.7535,3.6248,1.9497,1.9198,6.1209,6.19,5.4124,2.3649,2.0964,2.84,1.8547,2.2989,0.2866,1.9239,3.696,2.8456,0.983,1.4613,4.0276,7.8819,2.225,2.2916,1.0489]}
{"id":2805,"ended":true,"length":377,"text":"After her commissioning, Karlsruhe was assigned to overseas duties in the Caribbean, where she was to relieve the cruiser Dresden. She arrived in the area in July 1914, days before the outbreak of war on the Western Front. On 23 July she was tasked to protect Allied shipping, including troop liners, from possible German submarine activity. On 25 July she captured the submarine.\n\nIn February 1915, Karlsruhe was stationed in the Mediterranean, where she protected Allied shipping and undertook occasional cruises to enforce the neutrality of Italian ports in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and to help protect Allied and Italian war correspondents there. That month she returned to her home port of Saint-Nazaire, from which she returned to the Mediterranean in June.\n\nIn 1917 Karlsruhe was stationed in the Gulf of St. Clair in Canada, and after her replacement by the light cruiser Dresden in August served in the United States. She also provided protection for Allied agents in the United States and Canada and in April 1918 conducted torpedo warfare exercises with destroyers in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. In autumn she was sent back to Saint-Nazaire, where she joined up with the British light cruiser. Karlsruhe and the light cruiser took part in a screening operation in November 1918. Between November 1918 and September 1919 Karlsruhe was stationed in the North Sea, covering ships carrying troops to and from the United Kingdom, and at the beginning of 1920 was sent on a voyage home to Germany.\n\nFollowing her return from this deployment, Karlsruhe was stationed in Germany until March 1922, when she was transferred to the Mediterranean Sea and then served in the Black Sea between May and November 1922. In 1926 Karlsruhe was sent to the Far East for service with the Asiatic Fleet, but returned to Germany in December. Karlsruhe left the German navy in March 1929 as the light cruisers were being phased out, and served as an experimental establishment with the German navy police for the next two years. Decommissioned in August 1931, she stayed in reserve until February 1938.","token_len":432,"entropy":[5.8274,8.7691,1.6774,0.9434,8.4603,5.3795,0.2615,0.0341,2.3529,5.6165,0.4083,10.8369,1.735,2.0025,1.9684,6.4192,1.4451,0.7401,0.349,2.1257,4.4093,9.2755,2.3621,9.7936,11.359,2.0881,2.1924,4.3408,0.9183,2.0888,5.4189,1.6297,3.5755,4.3994,0.8794,8.7682,0.803,0.7034,2.6851,0.016,1.0994,5.3938,0.9776,4.2221,0.1087,0.4341,3.7038,5.73,1.5045,1.4187,1.1126,5.7263,2.0601,5.0282,5.4729,3.0968,2.9498,3.5743,7.7528,10.0703,0.0256,1.097,1.1507,5.3022,2.475,4.3379,3.7967,0.7777,2.9004,3.4998,0.0434,0.6579,6.9639,1.3366,5.1489,7.4422,1.8789,0.0023,2.5745,3.6356,0.5703,0.4671,1.5257,0.0115,0.0021,0.0156,1.1096,4.5555,1.085,1.5468,2.9527,1.2677,1.0412,0.093,6.0282,2.2995,1.5967,2.2037,7.8444,7.4605,6.29,0.0539,1.444,9.3244,1.3993,1.7656,0.1553,5.2948,3.332,3.6827,0.4546,8.3015,0.0274,0.0106,0.0514,0.0013,2.2492,3.111,1.8936,3.4549,3.2172,1.7612,5.1467,3.0593,5.8261,7.2058,0.0388,6.6269,0.3593,6.8186,2.7603,1.0282,3.9919,0.2152,3.3919,1.4864,2.3196,0.3013,6.6173,0.5466,3.3869,0.0193,0.0024,0.6664,6.3681,0.3875,0.2501,4.0794,0.5954,2.1888,3.8771,1.6648,2.8014,2.0541,1.0638,0.0002,1.8939,4.6555,3.4522,0.0045,0.0032,0.0214,1.198,3.362,0.5676,1.1751,5.4157,0.2292,3.0531,0.2265,7.6111,3.1353,5.8013,0.6735,2.8044,4.5148,2.0182,7.4079,2.496,2.7897,7.8517,0.27,4.0578,1.8715,2.4069,8.2807,1.7945,0.6753,4.6856,0.1522,1.0617,1.5949,3.2605,3.8473,3.3654,1.0026,1.8854,8.1201,1.0621,0.9537,3.1833,0.2297,1.6157,1.9566,3.5456,3.5183,7.7946,0.9359,6.7801,5.7851,5.8607,4.9117,2.0254,8.2234,0.0012,2.4652,0.8996,2.71,0.2151,0.4043,0.0029,2.6745,0.4614,2.2549,6.4785,2.0679,1.2973,3.2657,2.6109,0.1016,4.4272,0.2538,0.7078,0.0025,0.0021,1.4372,0.5259,0.0774,4.2928,4.9048,0.0638,1.0797,5.9894,6.4658,0.0567,6.3031,4.4913,0.003,0.0042,0.0303,4.0491,1.6325,2.534,0.0238,5.3146,0.2627,0.0071,1.7614,8.603,3.0319,1.4675,3.2899,0.6533,1.4039,6.633,2.3007,2.4155,0.0313,4.0331,0.2704,3.8203,0.0025,0.0036,0.0333,1.088,2.2423,0.6437,1.1489,4.3036,1.5003,1.1185,5.4153,6.9439,4.18,3.8922,2.7723,1.7312,0.0112,1.0309,3.2201,2.0306,2.1529,2.408,3.9743,1.7119,3.5432,0.0109,4.6026,2.4505,4.235,4.0458,0.8366,4.6427,6.4089,0.6692,3.8379,0.4564,0.6501,0.0002,4.8395,0.8377,1.8314,2.4647,3.7509,3.311,0.5108,0.7712,0.0018,0.0027,0.0276,1.3067,3.9304,0.5967,3.2937,3.7199,3.2578,2.4671,0.8693,0.2279,0.1447,1.0235,1.5571,0.1065,0.8867,3.6151,4.163,3.0196,3.1404,6.4564,1.2941,0.8449,7.1003,0.052,5.0538,3.0317,1.0384,3.2144,0.5832,0.2257,2.2724,4.6594,3.3674,0.0019,0.0028,0.026,0.9332,3.2748,0.619,1.2707,4.9514,0.2097,3.4515,5.3604,1.7459,0.3503,7.8159,0.3147,0.001,2.9684,1.4505,3.4144,3.2863,0.4381,3.1097,0.9001,2.766,2.8696,4.0393,0.0013,0.0026,0.037,3.8108,1.2667,3.1438,1.6942,0.5518,2.9317,2.3277,3.9639,2.1187,6.6602,5.0682,0.0627,3.0736,2.1267,5.761,0.0124,2.9711,0.8963,4.3886,1.3984,2.0425,7.1058,13.2421,4.4215,0.9266,2.9481,2.2226,11.8551,3.6703,1.9515,1.4327,1.7081,0.2745,0.2515,10.2259,2.44,0.0044,0.1669,0.6115,2.9401,1.9395,0.3729,0.804,5.5817,0.7921,8.4894,0.9263,3.8051,3.8241,1.0642]}
{"id":4014,"ended":true,"length":408,"text":"< unk > of a plasma requires that plasma currents close on themselves in electric circuits. Such circuits follow Kirchhoff's circuit laws and possess a resistance and inductance. These circuits must generally satisfy the Pareto Rule. The first law of thermo dynamics tells that an increase of the temperature of a system will increase the net energy (expressed in mass) of the system. The second law states that any system being accelerated will tend towards the state of equilibrium (a non zero net energy). If the velocity and energy are both constant, the equation of motion will be invariant and the system will tend and remain in equilibrium. The 3 first laws can be related by two additional equations of motion. One of these equations predicts the maximum possible power that can be extracted from a system. The second equation is the equation to describe the evolution of the entropy in the system. Any system that is driven towards instability is described by the equation of motion that predicts that entropy decreases.\n\n\"The Pareto efficiency is the ratio of the average output to the average input expended in a process...\". The Pareto rule is that 80% of the value of work can be obtained from 20% of the input. 80% of the work can be obtain if the work being done on the system is exactly one half of the work that can be performed. This means that only 20% of the total energy being used is going to the useful end. On the other hand, 100% of the energy of the system can theoretically go towards doing useful work.\n\nThe Pareto principle states that most of the total work done by a system can be attributed to the activity of few of the system's components or subsystems. The Pareto rule works as a guide to energy conservation by helping you minimize the number of sub-subsystems within a system, while ensuring that the system is performing the maximum possible amount of work as well as the maximum possible efficiency. When the system works the maximum possible amount of work with the minimum amount of input, it is also performing the maximum possible amount of work with the maximum amount of energy conservation.","token_len":432,"entropy":[9.1943,7.6379,6.8885,7.659,3.5025,10.7551,11.7007,3.5373,3.8403,9.8153,6.8902,6.0671,5.6949,3.9702,8.8063,5.4813,1.4208,4.5379,3.874,7.5448,10.6038,2.8293,0.471,0.3875,5.8012,5.5332,2.3083,7.7889,1.9225,5.8412,4.2193,5.4117,0.2171,3.3813,3.6624,1.5658,4.3321,7.3474,5.8259,1.0338,6.9001,4.573,0.1068,6.2515,1.5353,2.3242,4.9333,4.313,1.0584,7.2012,1.1757,9.1336,6.056,3.3766,3.2806,5.5621,2.4086,2.2187,3.8641,0.7106,1.0934,4.2901,2.9927,2.8003,0.6826,6.6906,2.4189,3.8866,6.0741,0.3549,0.7533,3.9289,0.3879,0.579,0.6395,0.3856,0.8323,1.4034,0.6636,0.1431,3.5243,0.0644,4.0182,3.3464,5.8548,5.5459,1.7279,4.3115,3.4033,2.5566,6.4213,0.9953,1.3917,2.929,4.555,5.0073,8.4069,5.8501,0.2821,1.4456,3.8157,1.2318,5.4251,3.5857,2.848,3.199,4.8249,3.0334,0.7793,1.2791,5.141,2.4575,3.2935,2.6179,1.1878,5.2535,0.017,2.5505,1.0129,2.0146,0.5004,4.5671,8.4905,4.0859,1.3482,0.2582,0.402,1.8738,6.6685,7.54,0.706,4.6445,0.3859,6.8044,3.1572,4.3137,4.6794,1.5565,3.5103,0.7602,1.0465,3.2831,1.324,0.4809,0.4825,5.2517,1.6285,4.6148,3.5267,3.9185,3.4269,1.7383,0.0611,4.4646,0.3058,0.8839,1.1639,1.3004,0.6361,1.3622,0.7036,2.8984,2.1016,4.8132,5.2735,4.33,0.6089,6.6908,0.0796,1.1661,5.473,3.1856,1.1425,0.8206,0.4263,6.0115,1.0025,1.7629,1.5093,5.6642,4.2333,7.2457,2.6045,5.4097,0.7952,0.7281,2.0604,1.325,1.9505,4.8991,3.3026,2.9624,2.9732,4.2903,1.1871,2.709,0.0145,5.96,1.8438,3.9924,0.0109,0.001,10.6979,2.1108,1.9069,2.3949,0.3196,0.8877,4.8465,6.0809,4.1037,0.3464,1.8893,3.6871,13.4151,1.444,1.9427,3.0722,8.7738,5.114,2.9239,2.0666,0.0038,0.0015,1.9498,1.5602,5.4944,8.2855,0.4381,0.2153,0.9284,6.0361,0.4184,7.8853,3.8053,0.102,1.9278,1.2302,7.8222,1.3639,0.4193,0.6302,3.2883,0.9208,6.2562,0.1558,0.5097,0.6142,2.1667,1.5531,0.2144,6.338,4.0441,1.058,3.3127,4.6537,1.1443,4.4995,1.0803,0.7094,0.5176,7.863,4.5961,5.3287,0.458,0.427,2.3082,2.5748,2.6445,0.0411,2.4051,1.4752,2.3811,2.1978,0.149,4.457,2.6432,0.0705,0.0776,0.314,2.319,1.7737,5.0036,2.7244,2.2736,3.705,0.2029,3.1585,9.5712,5.1478,0.949,5.6437,0.4087,0.1311,0.0233,0.097,4.5768,0.0632,0.1319,0.1215,0.8352,4.4939,0.666,0.8151,1.917,8.0552,5.1121,3.7842,5.1566,1.5247,0.7659,0.5789,2.0635,0.0003,1.8997,1.7945,0.0029,0.0029,3.2308,3.2204,0.0885,5.7294,1.242,0.1503,4.5745,2.8524,3.0089,2.5138,0.7091,0.5796,1.8638,0.2044,5.9908,0.063,1.1059,5.2945,0.1745,8.2174,4.6408,0.5768,4.564,0.1391,2.677,4.4945,3.9306,0.0161,0.2315,1.7331,2.3709,0.0012,0.0032,1.2883,6.8932,3.4828,2.4417,3.6902,1.1175,6.1432,2.3246,3.544,6.5622,3.867,4.7917,0.8689,3.5683,0.043,6.4084,0.8931,5.1171,0.7947,0.3354,5.0106,0.7653,0.1732,3.1044,3.82,3.7949,0.4667,1.2743,2.504,1.3227,5.0504,2.3961,4.9672,0.9774,2.2773,0.0071,0.3249,4.4683,3.356,0.2362,2.4092,1.9533,0.7373,2.3757,0.3983,4.8657,2.0149,1.5742,5.0782,4.2883,2.732,0.2941,1.3485,0.0174,0.3615,5.3898,1.5565,2.1797,2.2176,0.0212,4.5114,1.9769,2.0717,1.3115,5.0489,6.5374,0.4967,0.6603,0.0683,0.2379,0.002,0.1307,1.4529,0.4248,1.7847,1.3402,0.0012,2.6626,7.0157,0.2688]}

{"id":4280,"ended":true,"length":360,"text":"Mich\u00e8le Mouton was born 23 June 1951 in Grasse, a town on the French Riviera known for its perfume industry, close to the mountain stages famously featured in French rallies. Her parents' marriage ended in divorce, and her mother went on to a long career as an actress, including a stint on the sitcom L'aventure de Monet (1973-79).\n\nIn 1969, Mouton won the French national road-racing champion title. The same year, she achieved a win and second place in the Giro Ciclistica d'Italia, held on Italy and Spain. In 1970, she rode for T-Mobile in two road-racing events in Europe (one stage of the UCI Tour de France and three stages in the Giro d'Italia ) as well as the first edition of the Tour of California (in which she came 19th overall). In 1971 she participated in the first edition of the World Championships road race in Grenoble.\n\nIn 1975, she returned to competitive cycling, this time joining the women's team of the Lotto team. In 1976, she won the French championship again and joined the British national team. In 1977, she won the British championship and the Olympic Games team pursuit. In 1978, Mouton won the UCI World Championship points race as well as the World Cup. She also won the British road-racing national championship in this same year, thus becoming the only Canadian and the third woman to claim a national championship title on the British professional continental scene. Later the same year she won the Grand Prix de Denain (1 stage and the overall classification), a one-week stage race in France.

{"id":1311,"ended":true,"length":368,"text":"Beginning with the 12th century, important socio @ - @ political changes took place in the Deccan, south of the Krishna river. During this period, the Hoysalas, native Kannadigas from the North [Karnataka ], began to rule over most of the territory around present day, the districts of Belgaum, Bagalkot, Gadag, Haveri, Gulbarga, Ramanagara and Koppal.\n\nBy the time Tipu Sultan came on the scene, the Kannada language, which, in its mother tongue Malyari, was a dialect of the language called Kurukkal, was already accepted as the only language spoken by the Hindus of the Deccan. The use of that language had become important for the administration of the country as well as all those rituals which had its root in the language.\n\nAfter a long period of conflict with the British during which much effort was made to weaken the use of Malyari as the language and that of the Kannadigas as its medium, all efforts failed in the 19th century. It was then that the use of Kannada as a medium for all educational institutions was recognised as compulsory.\n\nIn 1868, a law was passed in British parliament to make the teaching of native languages compulsory up to the level of school as well as college. A similar law has also been passed in 1956. Under this law, the use of Kannada was made compulsory for both government as well as non - government educational institutions from the year 1976 for only nine years. But, as it had to be observed at the time that the usage of Kannada in schools was not satisfactory, the law was later again amended by extending the period of usage of the language in schools to 12 years.\n\nToday, the most significant results of this law can be seen in the form of a vast difference in the standard of Kannada as a language, as against the standards of the other regional languages like Konkani, Marathi, Tulu and others.\n\nTo be continued...","token_len":433,"entropy":[4.3163,1.2083,7.4795,0.8996,2.9445,0.564,8.8481,8.5064,14.8459,7.0618,4.6971,5.6244,5.165,2.4329,0.0376,1.1691,1.4805,9.3156,1.971,0.0274,2.0767,7.1843,0.7089,2.1159,12.7782,2.6662,0.9678,4.5288,1.4605,0.5697,0.5736,1.6117,6.9858,6.9282,2.8095,3.1689,2.6519,9.0087,6.0478,1.0685,2.6492,5.7089,0.2237,4.2733,1.2755,5.2101,8.6008,3.0513,3.576,0.0107,6.1021,3.6403,0.5058,5.3373,2.3509,5.2498,0.2664,0.4946,4.1915,4.3678,8.3464,1.0342,3.5948,3.7355,6.4489,0.971,8.1765,3.414,2.6675,1.2352,7.9278,5.3283,4.5387,1.1781,8.1163,3.8203,4.0403,4.6653,7.1562,1.668,0.5172,6.7295,3.6233,1.2034,1.3513,0.3849,6.6257,3.0418,5.5182,1.2028,2.9934,6.8101,2.2583,1.642,2.5421,0.1224,4.3865,0.6179,2.6098,9.0964,0.1507,0.3745,4.7027,4.6488,1.1162,0.436,1.0055,1.3688,2.8077,0.1064,1.2527,5.786,3.4159,2.1508,5.7263,2.2764,2.4352,9.9702,0.0267,9.2549,6.9872,7.4024,0.768,1.3145,2.993,2.8487,0.4612,1.6744,4.0945,6.4863,6.0584,3.7412,3.6611,3.6607,1.1239,1.2145,3.0462,6.1623,1.3346,1.4319,4.9646,1.9817,2.4946,0.9321,0.5954,3.6079,2.4457,0.9589,4.6481,0.011,0.006,0.5916,1.9582,6.8736,0.0345,5.4321,0.2312,3.9267,2.6302,4.629,2.3009,0.7757,6.5866,0.1732,0.807,3.6789,3.1704,1.382,0.2417,6.4005,4.0006,9.1444,2.6272,2.3276,6.8206,3.9642,0.1165,0.8672,2.2596,0.7887,1.4104,0.0003,4.3037,3.6793,2.1449,0.7473,0.1325,5.1575,1.9594,0.4772,5.0668,4.1676,3.2731,5.4255,4.3911,0.245,0.8433,0.3758,6.2754,0.4318,7.8215,0.0336,2.6615,0.1597,0.0164,3.55,1.5161,1.4257,3.9839,5.5519,0.789,0.8643,2.7572,0.018,3.0848,0.121,0.0105,3.2524,3.8626,7.2374,1.2556,5.4405,3.6198,4.0928,3.012,1.3947,4.991,0.0128,0.0523,0.7259,3.7092,0.7379,3.6518,0.5728,0.9621,5.5843,0.0275,3.2305,0.0239,0.4167,2.2266,0.9439,0.5445,1.9051,3.7284,7.4214,2.4201,2.0727,5.2328,1.3319,7.0527,1.6679,1.1378,0.0002,2.1633,2.5638,3.8059,0.4884,2.4557,5.0908,0.4247,0.4643,1.954,6.9881,4.4259,2.6099,3.0257,1.7541,5.8831,0.0685,7.5284,1.9499,0.4801,9.6026,0.3473,1.0352,3.5229,0.0597,5.4145,6.681,1.2228,0.0363,6.5076,1.2677,4.3615,3.9157,0.4009,4.18,2.922,0.0551,0.4434,0.3971,8.0087,1.4101,5.6904,1.2902,0.2838,0.3229,1.6991,3.9693,0.0258,1.7811,0.0039,0.0937,2.4898,4.3485,0.6961,1.2563,4.7464,5.9372,5.1783,0.008,0.0071,2.2642,7.8958,1.0492,3.3379,0.169,6.219,1.6846,4.1491,6.8616,6.8166,6.509,5.784,0.8699,0.5047,5.6757,2.0777,2.5912,3.2037,3.6858,4.2495,0.8883,6.086,3.8271,1.0534,0.4871,3.6687,1.4862,5.6237,0.1416,1.2383,0.0025,0.0411,2.5618,2.251,0.5939,1.5417,8.2437,1.001,1.1254,2.0156,0.6724,4.545,8.336,1.9615,2.6452,8.0567,0.6202,2.4654,0.6817,7.3181,1.2827,1.3763,0.4846,3.5963,1.379,1.0251,3.6054,0.1948,0.6056,0.5882,0.0002,4.2477,0.288,1.3932,5.0964,3.5977,8.0917,0.4789,1.5656,1.1069,4.6375,0.0662,0.9746,0.5207,0.717,5.0479,0.0929,2.723,6.9308,6.7549,0.3824,0.695,5.6471,0.2564,4.5071,0.0071,0.133,4.15,0.7732,2.4358,2.9419,2.1884,7.5718,1.3016,6.4629,0.5618,1.6932,2.1361,6.5737,0.4327,3.7666,9.8519,3.4118,4.726,0.7023,5.7229,0.6116,0.3734,5.9641,4.531,0.9376,4.8639,0.285,1.0736,0.0002,5.2039,3.2981,2.5133,1.3548]}
{"id":4488,"ended":false,"length":389,"text":"At the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards, John Noble submitted `` The Firefly ``, along with `` Entrada `` and `` The Day We Died ``, for consideration in the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series category, along with his co-stars Mark Sheppard and Jennifer Ehle.\n\nIt was, of course, rejected by the TV Academy, but, if nothing else, it served to show that people do see these shows (even those who never pay for them) and do believe Noble is a fantastic actor.\n\nNow Noble is back with another series that will be coming up on Syfy. Next month, Friday, Sept. 23, he will be back on the science-fiction airwaves when he makes his debut on `` The Defiant Ones and the X Files: The Lost Episodes. `` He will be playing one of his favorite characters, Dr. John Kennex, on the former.\n\nThe show, as you know, is a revival of the original X-Files and will be set in New York City. The original series followed FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), and Noble's character, a doctor working for the FBI, was brought in the second season as a key support character.\n\nHow did Noble get the gig?\n\n`` Mark Sheppard was our main contact, because Mark is going to be in it, although at the time, he was more active on Dark Wings, Dark Words (on Angel) and I was working on Star Trek: Voyager,`` said Noble. `` Mark Sheppard recommended me to David and Gillian (Anderson), and the rest was history.``\n\nNoble is looking forward to the show, and getting to take the Kennex character back on television.\n\n`` It's been a dream of mine to do this, and it's all come true in the last year,`` said Noble. `` This is the third time I've been with the show, and it was amazing to be part of it again. It was a very fun and memorable experience.``","token_len":433,"entropy":[2.5476,12.0539,0.1544,5.9378,0.3373,0.2232,0.1348,0.7341,5.3454,7.9416,9.1165,13.1809,8.0134,10.4538,5.3285,2.4526,5.0023,0.0048,3.6023,7.7496,7.4531,2.1755,3.0602,1.3641,0.334,2.155,5.3745,5.0301,6.3713,1.7074,1.8436,2.0853,4.5865,2.1759,0.5328,6.3758,0.0067,1.9974,0.4209,3.7614,0.0178,1.5816,0.0895,1.4508,2.6748,2.8565,0.0017,4.0276,4.4899,0.0055,1.7982,6.745,7.56,0.6683,0.6511,5.5143,4.6512,0.0825,0.3505,1.6722,0.0011,5.8171,0.5587,7.0721,1.2689,0.006,0.0051,7.2305,0.8521,0.9236,5.5567,2.1907,1.4059,2.7722,5.1298,4.0589,5.0008,0.0262,0.0198,1.4549,5.6885,2.2201,2.9351,0.8538,5.4777,4.4477,5.4154,4.9548,2.1422,5.7292,3.6307,3.4067,1.2621,3.8088,6.5998,2.4202,0.4987,0.5038,2.0083,5.3214,4.9942,15.1951,1.5016,1.6736,4.4507,0.7788,0.7199,1.0366,0.0003,4.9339,5.2609,1.3709,1.7021,1.8616,2.1947,4.2562,3.0197,1.925,1.6441,4.7557,2.9518,2.6135,5.7524,0.1105,2.4915,6.5906,2.623,0.4512,8.3291,0.9412,3.1826,0.0371,3.3292,0.8478,3.3722,0.9966,1.9854,2.243,1.76,1.5157,8.8167,1.0384,0.019,7.5584,0.8234,6.1109,1.3525,4.6126,0.3551,3.0202,1.5248,7.0504,2.0021,7.9018,0.8625,3.9167,4.1228,0.9558,6.3151,4.1085,1.4339,1.4481,4.7326,6.8492,0.0329,2.4635,3.6245,2.6579,1.2183,1.6613,4.2285,4.6434,0.1141,2.8897,2.6521,0.6194,0.5046,3.8971,0.0188,4.3532,8.7899,7.5947,0.3949,2.6059,0.837,8.2717,4.572,0.9626,0.0002,2.3827,2.085,1.939,4.4183,2.6845,2.3079,0.196,1.0764,2.1044,6.2289,0.0558,0.6794,2.467,4.9679,0.4302,0.0715,3.4074,3.5143,1.3868,4.3817,0.4905,3.7531,0.2913,0.3992,1.3933,2.0376,2.4485,1.3272,5.5388,7.2978,4.8207,1.9307,8.8746,1.7806,0.017,1.2185,3.0776,2.6173,0.0017,0.0004,0.0,0.2285,0.0659,5.282,0.0079,0.1113,4.0737,1.1612,0.035,1.1732,2.5812,7.6586,2.2559,2.0281,1.4089,2.766,4.2087,4.1928,0.843,0.9522,1.4846,1.2683,2.8923,3.9353,2.8593,6.8632,4.5243,0.4796,2.5705,0.7389,6.833,7.9644,1.4972,0.88,0.8364,0.0002,6.479,1.7564,3.533,1.4711,2.8699,3.6386,0.6791,1.5837,0.0001,4.3235,8.6749,1.8756,0.0024,2.5203,4.4945,4.0501,8.9823,2.1777,3.6212,3.9249,2.414,6.0084,0.1409,0.4428,2.9822,4.6086,2.3275,6.7543,5.5308,0.5947,0.8616,1.6096,1.5015,0.8796,5.2237,7.197,1.1249,9.1809,10.453,1.8526,6.9157,7.8625,3.7379,6.5193,7.9152,2.4729,0.172,4.0308,2.1214,2.8343,0.4397,4.6138,0.3332,1.5027,1.3036,2.0291,9.8159,1.7701,0.7337,0.289,0.6486,3.2239,5.539,0.0005,10.3121,1.5059,0.8075,3.9256,3.2622,6.2062,0.029,3.4595,1.1538,1.3083,1.243,4.1888,4.6497,2.4416,0.3703,0.4344,5.9609,0.3603,0.0002,4.3982,0.0009,2.4132,6.4932,0.4842,0.0135,2.2487,2.0316,2.0018,1.5164,6.1836,1.0797,5.4307,2.1253,14.6364,0.0447,2.3141,2.9054,2.0915,3.8616,0.5649,0.8913,0.0002,2.2214,3.1684,0.7594,2.9122,0.9947,4.0885,2.5643,0.0303,0.4326,1.5792,1.6063,1.8077,1.285,2.1648,0.4595,5.0494,4.3438,0.4569,3.9684,0.9918,0.6876,2.2087,1.8117,1.6644,0.6094,0.4596,0.1723,0.187,4.662,0.8136,1.82,4.4722,1.1478,0.7424,0.1742,1.3359,5.4017,2.2133,1.051,0.9733,0.4294,1.3481,2.5264,4.267,0.9075,1.633,2.4466,0.0029,0.7259,5.1116,0.4692,1.8567,1.4661,1.6796,3.2761,3.2973,2.9706,5.1105,0.65,1.0312,3.7182]}

On 8 May 1940 \u2013 on the eve of the German Invasion of France \u2013 the 908th Fusilier Grenadier Regiment, along with a small number of other German-trained, Belgian units, was mobilized in the Mosel to defend France.\n\nBy the time the German invasion came on 10 May 1940, however, the Belgian units were badly in need of reinforcements. M\u00f6lders, however, believed the Germans would focus on the defense of Antwerp and Brussels as the German armies launched their invasion of Belgium from French ports. He ordered General der Infanterie Heinrich von Lindemann to reinforce those units already stationed in the Mosel.\n\nAfter a failed attempt to send von Lindemann's soldiers to reinforce the 908th Fusilier Grenadier Regiment by rail from Luxembourg in Belgium, M\u00f6lders directed General von Treskow, the commander of the 16th Panzer Grenadier Division, to send his soldiers by vehicle. A series of roadblocks and delays set up by von Treskow, meant von Lindemann's men were forced to wait weeks in the Mosel before embarking on the rest of their journey to their new home at Fort de Metz.\n\nOnce at Fort de Metz, the 908th Grenadier Regiment served as the infantry base of the 16th Panzer Grenadier Division, which remained in Fort de Metz for the rest of the war. When the Germans captured Fort de Metz on 15 May 1944, the regiment's headquarters was relocated to the nearby city of Metz. After the war, the regiment was absorbed into the Belgian Army and became the 908th (1st Mosel) Regiment.\n\nFaction - Prussian.\n\nCombatant Affiliation - Wehrmacht.\n\nRegimental Combat Characteristic - German.\n\nRegimental Strength - 700 men.","token_len":433,"entropy":[2.5476,7.8855,0.8239,1.8502,0.0101,0.5136,6.3789,6.2842,2.4616,1.6353,0.189,7.9976,4.453,4.3206,2.2783,7.7273,16.0361,2.3968,1.8035,5.0543,1.1342,1.4068,6.0826,11.6023,3.818,0.7991,4.0379,5.5495,0.7074,6.3678,4.6385,0.0711,13.3735,8.4254,0.2873,8.9262,10.677,4.1816,0.5438,1.7918,0.7857,3.8089,3.8699,3.7158,1.1197,5.7542,4.3665,0.6839,2.1896,0.0013,0.3381,3.3596,6.0749,0.4383,2.7339,0.1955,1.5519,6.6349,9.8406,0.808,6.5975,2.4475,0.53,0.0257,8.1934,0.0921,1.0441,2.2797,4.2956,0.0288,2.8414,3.0041,1.8105,0.0027,2.2041,2.4606,4.6469,2.633,4.2232,6.0912,4.4103,0.5027,2.4006,5.726,2.3443,0.9891,3.0287,0.0483,0.0236,1.8536,2.5554,2.6856,1.4209,1.6016,0.0019,3.7202,1.2902,1.804,0.9019,3.5159,1.3506,4.2767,2.8577,3.7066,1.3179,0.7137,0.2485,4.6968,0.0056,0.9213,6.2505,2.9943,1.2812,5.9277,4.5417,0.1945,0.0419,0.9051,0.6744,2.9201,0.0537,0.0046,0.0023,4.2271,3.1509,0.0042,5.6564,2.5849,3.2073,1.6499,7.3137,0.6408,1.5997,5.596,0.1345,9.7977,0.0025,0.0044,1.3024,4.6901,3.8417,1.9605,4.0349,4.2066,5.6899,1.0807,2.5254,1.1621,0.9543,4.8254,8.0068,4.8418,0.5724,4.2997,3.0619,5.5613,9.4285,9.9245,2.9092,0.1899,3.3596,9.0771,0.2231,2.4718,5.9454,2.4989,0.1173,0.6127,4.5938,5.1753,2.0191,7.1209,1.9185,0.7425,1.0101,1.4057,0.0065,0.0148,0.9075,1.1015,0.0002,4.2073,2.4309,5.9344,0.7693,0.6174,4.5252,8.5668,0.0097,0.0055,0.0003,2.4689,4.8856,0.6851,3.3477,0.6528,4.1387,0.263,0.0142,0.8312,0.0029,0.0127,0.004,0.0347,0.0035,0.0708,4.6187,6.3968,4.0499,5.6501,2.651,5.6088,0.8475,1.6674,0.0048,0.0028,0.0029,5.4042,3.1996,1.3053,6.1892,7.1107,4.0431,2.808,2.9919,1.913,2.0333,0.0761,0.213,6.7606,0.1174,2.7089,4.0968,0.0084,1.8472,0.3526,0.1246,2.2559,2.1829,3.4907,5.6429,6.8484,2.6581,4.1734,5.1669,0.0006,5.7116,0.643,1.9179,4.3493,5.9522,3.299,1.1735,2.4147,1.7489,0.0005,0.0036,0.0028,2.7788,7.2151,5.9982,0.1889,0.0056,0.0003,1.3136,2.596,1.0936,2.3945,0.1249,3.1249,6.0742,1.7579,1.03,1.6123,0.004,0.0108,2.1098,4.9849,0.0088,0.1719,1.582,6.7139,0.0896,1.2536,2.3148,1.6466,4.5887,2.7857,0.7781,4.1451,6.0131,4.9845,8.4228,0.3685,1.0311,0.4083,0.0002,5.1794,2.869,0.9265,0.0905,0.0595,0.0003,0.215,1.4534,3.2096,0.0203,0.0148,4.0613,0.002,0.052,7.2761,1.4081,1.207,5.6654,5.1695,1.2414,0.3626,5.3389,0.0144,0.0636,0.0198,0.0011,0.3309,1.7468,1.8308,4.5717,1.2454,6.5096,0.2317,0.1001,0.0004,2.5083,1.8512,1.506,0.0008,0.4997,0.1129,0.1982,4.4686,0.8016,2.5938,4.6402,2.0856,0.0901,0.0507,0.0005,1.0417,3.261,1.978,3.2415,0.1842,1.2509,3.2985,2.3027,2.521,1.3949,3.4504,0.3026,1.1471,4.0863,3.9245,0.0479,5.9847,0.0429,0.7623,4.0921,1.1562,2.2446,0.2669,1.0471,1.7395,1.3785,7.5325,0.4415,0.253,3.1998,1.1466,2.0271,2.785,1.4586,4.2942,0.1303,0.0914,5.3916,4.9176,1.5192,6.4044,2.0279,0.0209,1.2087,3.9007,0.6215,0.3591,0.0002,5.4175,5.2992,7.1283,8.0287,0.1542,5.974,1.2094,0.0002,7.6338,3.896,9.1844,0.181,1.3836,6.7009,0.677,0.0019,0.0014,0.5702,0.1452,0.0001,5.2774,0.6974,3.1397,6.1714,4.9976,0.8333,3.3697,1.2545,0.1687,0.0002,4.3311,0.1331,4.3816,0.3427,7.2623,3.4449,0.4582]}
{"id":284,"ended":true,"length":387,"text":"The Holocaust Industry : Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering was published in 2000. Here, Finkelstein argues that Elie Wiesel and others exploit the memory of the Holocaust as an `` ideological weapon'', by presenting the Shoah as an existential threat to the Jewish people. He suggests the necessity of ``the end of the ``Holocaust industry'', warning that, if left unchecked, it will be capable of destroying the Jewish people.\n\nBy the time the world finally came to realize that Nazi extermination plans were not merely hypothetical, the power of this industry was very much manifest and its influence on the development of Israeli foreign policy was significant.\n\n...In retrospect, the use of the Holocaust as an ideological weapon was particularly harmful to the Jewish people, because it not only created an environment in which the State of Israel felt justified in its actions in Palestine, but it also facilitated the political success of Holocaust revisionism....\n\n...It has also provided a convenient excuse for an army that is increasingly intolerant of criticism or dissent both within its ranks and among the citizens who pay its wages....\n\nTo that end, the Israeli army has turned the Holocaust into an all-consuming national symbol....This campaign has become almost indistinguishable from Israel\u2019s propaganda campaign....\n\nOn one side are the Holocaust criminals, on the other are those trying to erase the memory of the Holocaust. In between is the nation that they have turned the Holocaust into, that is attempting to defend itself both symbolically and physically against \u201cthose who hate Israel,\u201d and of course against those who want to diminish the horrors of the Holocaust.\n\nThis is the Israeli-centric view of the Holocaust. The Israeli-centric view of the Holocaust has the effect of concealing the history of the Holocaust while also attempting to define it and exploit it.\n\nThese historical perspectives are complementary, and neither can be viewed in isolation from the others.\n\nIn other articles, Finkelstein suggests that the Israeli Holocaust industry can be viewed through the lens of a \u201cstrategic vision'' and \u201cmilitaristic ethos''.","token_len":433,"entropy":[10.9894,9.279,6.5676,9.152,0.1513,0.1652,0.6024,8.5493,0.3503,0.0638,0.1898,2.7757,6.6233,1.7776,8.871,0.7919,0.7248,5.005,1.2247,5.6831,2.1379,10.1488,0.3325,0.3715,4.0335,0.1653,9.9846,1.2554,0.6819,0.0089,2.9578,2.7112,6.2456,0.9114,6.0105,0.0973,1.0449,0.691,2.995,2.1867,11.0833,13.1758,2.1177,7.0782,0.9151,4.5006,3.9574,1.5999,7.6303,0.0154,0.4076,1.7296,6.2054,1.5443,0.3751,1.1884,0.946,0.9221,0.9948,2.0667,4.1566,3.5836,5.746,0.3686,5.5762,3.7119,6.8651,0.3365,0.7369,9.3816,2.432,0.0026,4.6729,1.9879,0.0326,8.6846,0.4388,3.9509,1.8676,4.8063,1.0188,0.0633,1.4372,1.2556,2.8684,6.5871,0.0235,2.3193,0.7323,1.1475,0.6835,1.8394,2.7663,0.042,6.3246,2.8348,2.0359,1.8068,5.2562,5.4355,2.7553,0.2863,3.6395,0.4979,5.2828,4.4645,6.6189,0.461,2.2969,3.0385,6.143,0.5173,2.2362,6.7053,0.26,4.5669,1.4293,1.0624,5.137,1.5921,6.8114,4.0203,4.3448,2.7273,2.1492,0.9723,4.8504,0.0618,5.6028,5.3813,0.0156,0.7431,4.5697,0.152,2.1547,0.0003,6.2946,4.6341,5.9314,0.3071,1.5209,5.4958,0.0389,1.201,0.7393,0.9328,0.5808,0.4748,0.1174,2.7077,4.5539,5.0329,0.8395,0.7505,1.7036,0.2507,1.5863,2.1468,0.6033,6.7473,0.0019,4.0513,2.1545,2.2885,1.0565,0.013,1.3149,6.362,0.656,0.0042,6.1015,4.916,0.1758,2.8286,3.394,3.5123,5.5825,0.4814,0.3743,1.855,1.0326,5.3822,0.6169,5.151,7.5031,0.0668,7.7071,2.2482,0.8548,5.2319,2.1398,0.0002,2.1489,3.331,3.0471,2.8408,3.8434,1.1903,4.1935,2.4393,0.2072,4.8947,5.7475,2.1736,2.5003,4.6169,6.597,0.0047,0.2207,3.0582,5.8225,2.907,7.7188,1.7206,2.4928,2.0624,0.0514,2.077,1.6608,6.0313,3.8694,5.9792,0.9222,4.2766,2.6519,0.5807,0.0002,4.9304,5.848,0.1869,0.0724,1.3854,4.1392,3.638,1.2723,5.1457,3.4121,2.2397,0.3107,1.436,5.2854,0.1148,1.9888,4.6781,5.6999,3.3279,7.0524,6.4011,1.6626,3.2245,4.5922,5.2643,0.023,6.5598,14.0282,7.1276,6.6678,5.6315,1.3069,2.4929,0.9746,0.0002,5.3169,4.3718,1.2957,2.1968,0.8371,4.4769,7.3087,1.169,4.0036,0.0146,0.0025,0.5142,2.5498,6.9482,0.0248,4.9006,0.7153,1.9579,0.1093,0.2672,0.5412,1.2966,3.0678,7.4345,2.2131,0.6047,6.82,2.5816,5.7888,2.4298,4.5353,3.0665,0.7214,0.0361,1.9077,4.3774,1.1655,9.2247,0.0647,5.4624,2.4871,7.1237,9.2933,0.016,0.0811,3.4939,2.2552,13.3374,4.8048,5.1751,0.2257,6.7911,3.3136,1.9784,3.9828,8.0684,1.1524,5.3153,0.1723,2.5975,0.5892,0.1444,3.4554,0.2704,6.9027,1.0535,6.9925,0.5198,0.3467,0.1276,0.6173,0.5648,0.0003,3.1697,1.3241,1.7582,4.3496,4.7824,6.2708,2.6797,0.4835,0.5377,0.3001,1.285,2.2058,3.4137,1.9328,0.2232,0.1931,0.5417,0.107,0.0661,3.2732,4.3701,3.3001,0.0831,6.178,0.1276,0.7346,4.7827,0.239,0.5964,0.7251,5.0916,3.3637,5.7094,0.0197,6.2783,1.4171,3.3902,8.2674,0.4928,1.2974,1.0624,0.0003,5.1846,6.5456,4.3169,1.2252,6.6372,2.1983,2.1605,5.4418,2.8716,0.4354,5.3413,1.8696,0.3511,2.2355,1.1369,4.8163,0.2587,1.2672,0.0003,3.1502,3.8385,8.8603,1.0742,1.5769,0.0028,0.0007,4.617,0.4522,1.0946,3.4143,3.3294,2.9566,4.131,0.398,2.4934,4.2905,0.983,0.3826,0.0039,2.3227,11.4064,0.7418,9.285,0.4427,4.4297,4.1269,3.2526,7.4307,0.0409,5.9827,1.006,0.5687,1.932,6.2315,3.7116]}
{"id":4015,"ended":true,"length":396,"text":"Narrow sheets with sharp gradients may separate regions with different properties such as magnetization, density and temperature, resulting in cell @ - @ like regions. Examples include the magnetosphere, heliosphere, ionosphere [ 1, 2 ], chromosphere [ 3 ], magnetosphere [ 4, 5 ]. The ionospheric layer, which is a two dimensional plasma layer in the upper layer of the ionosphere plays an important role in space weather forecasting for space communications and GPS. For the space weather forecasting, the accurate observations of ionospheric layer, especially, the layer where solar radiation plays an important part, is an important and major obstacle.\n\nOn one side, the high resolution satellite images from geostationary orbit (GEO) offer the spatial coverage needed to develop a highly accurate three dimensional view of the ionosphere to assist forecasting. However, the high cost of GEO-based instruments, the need to launch a large number of missions in order to achieve high resolution images and the limited availability of the orbiters limit their availability to small groups of scientists. The other option is to use interferometric ground based observations to complement GEO observations. Interferometric observations allow a high level of spatial detail, but they work best in the spectral and wavelength bands used by current instruments and are limited in the wavelength where GEO technology is developed. However, in many cases, more than one interferometer would be needed. If the interferometers were at altitudes other than GEO (such as ground based or mobile platforms) this would allow more observation points, but also require costly space based instruments to achieve the same spatial resolution.\n\nIn both cases the high resolution images and the large volumes of data need to be processed in order to reconstruct the ionosphere from these observations. A major problem concerns the accurate localization of the spatial structure of the ionosphere, especially, the layer where solar radiation plays an important part. If the spatial detail could be achieved at a sufficiently high resolution and the data volumes reduced, then the required time for the data processing could be greatly reduced. However, no successful technique has yet been found to do so.","token_len":434,"entropy":[9.8402,11.0903,3.9455,5.5801,9.6654,0.1363,5.7971,9.0864,8.607,3.2896,2.9184,4.5682,4.0079,0.089,6.7491,3.6441,1.3349,5.5337,1.7036,4.6123,2.3048,5.1545,0.0118,8.1237,15.7315,6.4862,8.9291,9.2279,4.8708,1.4776,7.2489,2.1429,2.914,5.6094,4.2707,1.5403,6.7467,0.3113,0.7394,0.6744,4.4723,0.0331,6.2792,4.9703,4.9847,0.3515,1.3633,6.9261,0.0856,1.1991,0.1403,1.7072,4.3794,0.7351,1.3588,0.0869,3.4777,0.0725,3.6532,2.2277,4.1155,3.3221,0.0461,3.7587,2.77,2.1682,1.124,3.191,6.802,1.7733,7.8783,1.5853,3.846,1.1932,4.0315,3.2958,0.9043,0.5602,3.524,0.0598,9.1929,1.191,0.0713,0.0471,0.2273,7.7836,2.4912,3.7858,4.4487,3.9491,7.6691,1.8389,6.8384,2.3574,3.962,2.8299,5.2745,0.1774,2.2836,2.6991,1.2624,9.767,4.9752,0.8222,2.3629,0.1118,0.0034,4.3173,3.8156,5.6227,6.3523,1.4519,8.0544,4.4583,5.6151,1.7955,6.7046,1.0798,0.0715,3.3847,0.5497,2.1424,4.3414,0.2287,4.8613,6.6145,5.685,0.9877,1.9156,0.0006,5.3884,4.755,1.7872,1.022,1.3231,5.085,2.5443,3.5574,3.6504,3.0165,6.4578,0.6843,0.0049,0.0003,2.7329,1.7841,0.3337,0.8073,0.1906,6.305,2.4216,6.994,3.7138,4.6937,1.0046,5.4633,2.0702,4.8213,0.9682,7.4885,0.363,4.0095,0.2,0.5751,2.1725,0.0414,5.4901,5.7333,6.9719,2.4992,3.7404,0.0331,1.3889,2.6286,6.6111,0.4292,4.7758,0.0252,4.6372,1.2177,4.6816,2.2364,3.1501,3.3491,0.8743,4.9524,2.4705,2.4643,0.6677,0.0051,5.7259,2.8377,1.8007,0.0296,3.3184,2.5387,0.5218,2.2051,2.2624,0.9964,3.9064,2.4533,0.062,3.1784,6.2402,4.2404,7.5834,3.5315,3.9182,1.8647,5.2951,3.2987,0.5531,2.9539,1.113,2.0347,5.7112,4.8255,0.5542,0.318,1.9214,6.7536,1.6317,2.2709,5.9299,3.6683,4.5046,1.7302,6.7125,2.4211,0.0062,2.5092,0.876,4.6373,0.0071,0.2492,2.5447,3.6471,2.9678,3.5216,2.3411,0.1306,3.2377,4.6068,2.4125,2.7438,2.364,7.1073,3.6942,1.8566,1.9224,7.7514,3.8381,4.9578,2.0662,4.4592,1.3126,7.1764,2.5476,2.5691,2.1586,4.0063,1.3152,1.3463,4.4268,7.7275,2.9165,0.0086,7.8183,0.7851,3.6063,0.3886,3.2848,0.0252,3.1894,3.3132,0.6457,0.7332,6.3707,2.014,0.7483,3.0795,0.0004,2.3779,4.6658,0.6993,1.2641,2.2446,5.0831,1.4777,3.0608,0.0019,2.6251,2.1631,6.2026,7.5979,0.0091,6.1187,0.016,4.3881,0.0052,3.8484,2.8711,0.003,8.2636,3.723,3.0972,6.3132,6.1448,1.4866,4.3267,0.7438,2.7961,2.9914,7.7846,5.6156,2.6521,1.4648,3.6036,4.7547,6.2234,2.8868,4.2159,0.9944,1.6246,3.7745,1.2078,1.5956,1.5234,0.7747,0.7242,1.0837,0.0002,2.4906,5.8628,1.2163,2.3528,4.0837,0.449,2.4817,2.4602,0.5742,3.4662,5.9043,0.2701,0.7114,4.7285,0.1805,0.0833,3.7082,1.5825,1.7324,0.0762,6.7613,0.5428,0.8202,0.2121,2.9037,5.1473,3.0462,0.317,3.6921,4.1511,1.4791,8.0838,0.5371,6.1635,6.6164,0.229,0.8502,7.8976,4.0169,0.3688,0.1911,0.2339,0.0339,2.2878,2.6022,5.0398,0.634,4.6687,1.3032,0.8872,0.092,0.1919,0.0799,0.0058,0.8704,0.5085,4.32,0.7669,3.9443,6.2659,6.5835,0.4539,5.253,3.8033,1.9153,5.3896,0.4624,0.4531,3.1548,1.349,3.4541,6.1847,6.867,0.8237,1.678,0.9447,6.7366,3.7352,2.281,1.4713,3.5479,2.9855,1.9017,0.2491,4.7819,0.1257,0.447,2.2713,0.0246,6.2072,5.9365,5.7659,2.2456,2.5158,0.0939,4.711,0.5162,3.0677,1.6172,0.6336]}

{"id":865,"ended":false,"length":411,"text":"The director Melina Matsoukas filmed the music video for `` Rockstar 101 `` in April 2010 ; she had previously directed the videos for Rihanna's singles `` Hard `` and `` Rude Boy `` in 2009. With the help of directors Christopher Columbus, who directed `` Get Carter \" (1993) and `` Who Framed Roger Rabbit `` (1988), she chose to film the video in the style of \" Get Carter \" (1993), for which Columbus also served as the makeup director. The video for `` Rockstar 101, \" released on April 8, 2010, is a parody of the movie Get Carter (1993).\n\nThis was a parody video for \"Rockstar 101\" - a song performed by Nicki Minaj. The video begins with Nicki showing up at a club to perform her song. She then picks up a young woman, takes her home, and makes her strip off her clothes. She proceeds to \"spank\" her, while also calling her various names. She then proceeds to do several lewd and suggestive acts, both to the woman and herself. Nicki then proceeds to dance on the woman, which then forces the woman to strip off her clothes as well. She then proceeds to give and take oral sex to Nicki before jumping off of her as she takes off her clothes. The video ends with the woman dressed in a pink bunny suit, playing the flute.\n\nDuring a music video shoot at a New York City hotel, Minaj was photographed as being tied up while her breasts were exposed. The set of pics were posted online for only nine hours before being deleted. Since the photo was deemed to be illegal and could potentially violate Minaj's confidentiality contract, her management group released a statement in Minaj's defense. The statement read: \"Ms. Minaj's management team has confirmed that these images were taken during a private shoot with a few members of the press. While we are in the process of getting all versions of the images, we are confident that they weren\u2019t illegally obtained and are intended to be a part of a music video that hasn\u2019t even been shot yet.\"","token_len":434,"entropy":[8.5847,12.5986,4.8573,8.3372,5.1703,0.1905,8.4823,0.9716,6.4611,0.4533,0.5778,10.2024,13.5916,4.1447,8.4747,3.4004,2.635,4.2676,2.9969,10.8715,2.5203,3.39,2.6879,2.1659,1.2257,7.7444,0.1786,9.0841,0.0008,1.6663,8.4184,0.9379,6.8433,9.7912,0.0823,0.2251,5.6641,3.0758,3.847,2.7653,2.8141,2.4045,1.0831,6.8441,1.3019,1.9694,0.0018,7.8287,5.4047,7.1507,1.4308,5.7062,2.7981,4.4825,6.9903,10.4685,4.8551,2.9,4.9283,0.9431,0.1288,1.4768,6.8185,1.5997,0.0023,0.0001,0.0584,3.5365,0.4981,4.6862,0.2427,2.4934,6.6308,0.8112,3.7111,0.9119,2.2122,2.9099,2.4409,2.8203,0.1338,4.4181,6.5083,2.0817,0.6225,1.8661,1.3165,1.4742,5.2732,0.2665,7.9047,3.1824,5.6425,0.0432,1.2325,7.2654,3.6172,0.2525,1.821,1.6193,2.2847,0.6257,1.5394,0.0557,0.1977,5.8919,2.7864,5.6224,1.3611,1.9095,3.351,0.0668,0.5647,0.5368,2.6938,2.2034,5.2483,0.1035,0.7006,3.2641,8.5695,0.156,2.9119,1.9588,0.9448,1.8319,0.0019,5.0212,3.0921,2.3673,5.1938,5.0533,1.747,2.7625,2.0405,0.0327,0.1904,2.4472,5.4476,2.0971,2.6235,4.6493,0.1472,6.7044,1.2891,0.009,0.0,1.5438,1.3828,1.2503,4.7445,0.3132,3.5173,0.0108,6.4601,3.0359,1.2408,1.1881,4.4233,2.4013,4.068,2.7408,1.8526,2.4441,1.7179,2.4333,5.7457,0.1867,1.0546,6.302,3.1166,2.2964,6.5935,0.3556,5.475,0.8973,0.4466,4.9142,0.7928,7.6403,3.0501,1.5209,1.8321,0.8342,1.4522,4.8356,0.0291,5.6395,7.2706,1.1685,0.2718,0.4961,1.8386,4.7809,3.2354,5.6929,0.7627,6.8542,0.8811,1.1314,1.7203,0.7631,2.1681,0.016,4.0536,5.4863,4.4663,2.7894,2.0571,1.6529,1.8451,5.691,3.6596,2.145,2.406,0.3801,3.7515,0.3797,2.6028,0.0087,1.4079,2.2875,0.0157,6.0612,3.614,1.5007,2.464,2.6044,3.0695,4.7327,5.5032,1.2363,0.7734,0.2064,2.9224,1.1422,0.5002,0.3366,3.9795,0.4145,0.2672,1.7553,0.4017,1.4882,0.0164,4.9589,4.614,1.2971,3.6903,0.2227,2.3498,3.5622,0.0065,4.1408,6.8851,1.2548,1.7562,0.6849,5.0419,0.7207,4.5681,0.4152,0.1052,1.0121,0.5097,2.4269,1.0026,0.7683,0.1378,2.3995,1.3723,6.8626,0.729,1.0201,4.5626,5.9228,1.0052,1.611,5.9946,2.8599,7.05,0.1704,1.9176,1.0881,0.0002,4.2117,2.5668,5.2648,0.0442,2.6489,2.3512,2.718,3.8753,0.2611,2.0152,3.3599,0.6578,6.0874,0.0279,2.069,3.4875,3.8627,5.2061,5.1945,0.3538,3.8957,4.4575,4.1759,0.3733,2.8989,0.6084,1.8318,7.8728,3.1596,9.4902,3.0765,2.6054,2.1008,3.9488,5.6486,6.3074,1.5971,2.5815,1.2951,1.6895,0.766,5.4409,1.2415,3.4663,0.5456,6.4828,2.6816,0.2571,4.4593,2.6128,4.2902,4.1226,2.7264,4.6551,0.0033,0.0201,6.7537,4.8953,0.3703,3.2429,5.1363,7.3268,4.8415,0.496,0.115,3.0643,11.5394,0.0121,0.0208,1.5059,1.686,2.0886,0.7132,2.2792,0.4393,1.1604,4.8748,0.0263,0.1474,0.0017,1.6942,5.2781,1.6051,1.8222,5.4576,0.5394,5.1562,2.1238,1.1266,1.2757,2.8991,1.3338,3.3476,3.3373,3.1887,2.3726,4.401,3.8426,0.0245,0.8895,3.9853,1.0965,3.8116,1.5449,2.0871,4.5348,0.7226,0.0818,0.0023,4.7891,3.5911,9.1137,0.203,0.9348,2.6056,2.4229,0.5639,1.7943,2.5261,0.2976,1.5544,8.2621,15.8805,8.3112,1.3237,4.8545,2.4653,1.5533,2.3242,9.887,0.7098,1.4152,4.0149,4.1637,0.0094,2.1199,5.5804,0.0291,2.1231,7.7163,1.962,0.1829,0.1215,6.7368,0.4671,2.9239,2.4448,0.9058]}
{"id":2137,"ended":true,"length":386,"text":"The Panic of 1873 led to growing criticism of high finance and the spread of radical Antisemitism, which in the 1880s became a broad undercurrent. These criticisms saw a separation of capital into two types \u2013 the \u2018robber barons\u2019 who exploited the working class, and the bankers who dispensed credit on interest \u2013 and these divisions of labour formed the basis of the Socialist party and radical politics more generally \u2013 including the rise of Zionism. These were the years of the Populist Revolution and the Chartists, both of which saw the formation of trade unions. At the same time, the growing capitalist crisis of 1873 led to a fall in profits and stock markets. This also allowed socialists to criticise the capitalist economy from the left \u2013 as Marxists \u2013 because the crisis revealed the inherent flaws of capitalism to them.\n\nThese conditions were important for the radical left to coalesce around a common strategy. In 1883 the New Nationalist Party was founded under Marxists such as Karl Kautsky and Julius Schacht, both of whom later would play key roles in the emergence of the Nazi party. The party was strongly Marxist in orientation. As part of its programme for government it called for a central bank to be replaced with a bank of the state, as well as for socialisation of the means of production, a ban on interest and capital punishment. Most importantly it called for the redistribution of land.\n\nIn January 1884 the New Nationalist Party was dissolved as the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) was formed. The SPD was also Marxist in orientation. However, as it had to appeal to the centre-right and the centre-left of the national parliamentary system, it developed a middle-of-the-road programme, and was therefore unable to implement its Marxist agenda. Instead, it focused on industrial reform and reform of capitalism itself. As a result the party found itself unable to prevent the rise of the Prussian-led right, and the party was gradually wiped of its left wing, and transformed into a liberal party. At this time Kautsky and Schacht moved to the SPD.","token_len":434,"entropy":[12.3161,1.303,1.978,4.4782,6.4509,0.3207,8.2269,5.5145,0.7397,8.2014,4.7557,1.3895,1.7466,5.7084,0.0091,4.6567,11.3835,3.8697,0.1208,0.0095,2.1138,1.7065,3.8612,3.1123,3.5244,0.1167,2.8031,1.805,6.1711,8.4951,0.071,4.4226,4.7605,2.8013,6.0369,2.8004,8.7548,1.097,5.415,5.0588,2.6922,2.68,3.4163,2.1085,14.4004,5.3652,8.5347,2.3606,2.743,0.3797,4.8437,8.6248,3.7576,6.5971,1.0782,4.7218,0.1969,1.834,0.1498,0.3245,5.9654,1.1479,7.7602,0.2088,4.7731,3.701,6.3078,5.5486,0.9673,5.5542,4.8938,4.1919,2.0105,4.7357,0.5937,0.6282,0.3205,0.7755,6.2315,3.0881,2.5002,7.0404,2.042,8.4363,0.4555,6.0031,4.2571,1.0578,4.5732,0.1186,9.3195,0.6971,4.133,3.6698,1.8057,4.7114,0.9482,0.879,8.4325,0.1467,0.1989,4.0799,1.8503,0.7667,8.8196,0.3587,1.9983,4.1641,0.4392,0.9547,3.8893,1.0948,4.2504,0.0273,6.5842,0.0759,2.6618,5.2464,0.3263,0.4743,0.0028,0.4829,1.0953,4.8329,5.7274,1.9758,2.4537,1.2773,2.88,2.109,0.1849,1.5802,5.5351,0.2897,5.1491,1.6387,7.6129,3.1232,1.5286,2.4524,4.2514,4.3887,6.263,0.1734,6.8998,0.0013,0.9671,2.8962,4.6224,4.5374,1.0428,2.1502,3.2634,3.4405,4.1759,2.7706,4.0931,4.3435,2.0744,3.5718,7.197,1.3114,5.6359,4.1155,0.564,0.9742,5.4439,4.4687,0.4267,0.9379,0.0024,4.6333,4.9617,2.1327,6.7518,1.4925,0.9288,5.2478,3.1717,2.4483,8.5789,0.0006,0.5057,3.4255,3.3418,3.5553,1.911,2.5241,1.9997,3.4811,2.2216,4.9087,6.1698,0.7449,1.1047,2.5759,2.0224,4.2557,5.6139,3.49,2.8994,0.009,4.0898,2.3749,0.0576,0.0025,1.0355,6.4287,6.0726,4.6274,1.8238,3.7805,0.3107,0.0602,4.9281,6.5434,5.07,2.0051,0.1444,0.1379,0.5859,4.5298,0.0481,0.4001,6.8209,0.8549,0.6035,1.6235,2.2533,1.6293,5.851,6.2675,1.7293,3.0009,2.5618,3.8083,4.1256,0.0012,1.4068,2.637,3.3604,7.5674,4.8517,4.7213,0.171,1.4958,5.0067,3.089,1.6469,1.3345,6.2106,2.929,0.6504,4.0185,0.4282,2.6674,1.6786,1.2278,4.0383,1.4855,0.0023,1.3615,4.7953,2.7521,0.6353,1.1445,1.2258,0.0316,0.0256,2.1794,3.4286,6.6803,0.028,6.3205,2.9251,2.069,5.1363,1.2389,6.9422,1.5376,2.0221,1.9774,0.0675,1.6753,5.7707,0.0158,4.7193,3.7219,1.5678,0.0002,2.3968,5.4127,0.2659,0.6201,1.0136,1.5874,0.1607,0.0991,0.2598,2.1748,4.0069,3.0288,1.6713,3.7812,0.6051,0.4941,2.2758,1.9512,1.3786,2.7085,0.0203,0.5747,1.5153,0.8037,0.6812,1.2945,3.6824,1.6418,4.3556,11.1386,1.014,0.5652,0.8988,3.631,0.3836,2.891,3.5304,2.5577,4.1308,6.1049,0.1184,1.1327,4.9576,0.6158,1.6493,2.3588,2.0442,2.8029,0.1341,0.054,2.2318,0.5327,5.8421,6.1386,3.1774,0.7791,0.99,5.4399,0.823,8.4369,0.7998,3.0835,0.0042,0.0611,0.0247,0.0605,3.1316,2.6189,3.425,2.8407,4.2587,3.6133,0.0475,5.3339,1.2869,4.6417,3.6075,0.7898,4.2872,1.3764,0.6538,3.1951,0.4028,6.5112,1.7624,1.251,3.9161,0.3432,4.686,4.4192,0.3794,3.4237,1.4122,0.2828,2.1892,2.2372,4.9081,0.3087,2.5885,0.0336,6.9755,0.8117,2.2813,0.0359,1.4098,7.5924,0.0052,3.8025,2.5717,5.4301,2.4821,1.8422,2.2558,5.0853,2.0628,5.7134,6.6857,8.2751,0.673,5.058,0.682,3.7133,2.5113,7.5797,0.2408,0.8283,6.046,0.8149,0.7627,4.7709,2.477,1.6981,6.6756,0.0064,0.0071,1.7034,0.3225,0.0031,6.2554,0.9379,1.6221,5.3257,1.9341]}

{"id":692,"ended":true,"length":418,"text":"Several influential decisions of the House of Lords have determined the limited scope for the use of prerogative powers. In 1915, an appeal was made to the House of Lords, Re Petition of the United Kingdom Transport Board against the First Commissioner of Income Tax (1908). The House of Lords held that, while powers of taxation are an inherent part of the functions of Parliament, their exercise \"may be restricted by statutory limitation\".\n\nIn the course of the debate, the Prime Minister, Sir Edward Grey, observed that there was \"a special difficulty arising out of the tax-raising powers because by the principle of equalisation it is impossible to tax all classes of persons who are required to contribute to the public revenue, but the power of taxation may be constitutionally and judicially restricted as to the extent to which it may be applied to different classes of people\".\n\nAn article in The Guardian by a lawyer and former member of the Labour Party, Sir Christopher Ansell, stated that the House of Lords was in effect saying:\n\n\"In my view, the government should be able to raise taxes to meet public expenditure where there is a need for them or public policy demands it - unless some legal obstacle prevents it. In my view, the House of Lords would be wrong to suggest that where public finances are short, government should raise taxes as widely as possible... The House of Lords would be wrong to suggest that where government wants money to deal with a sudden problem that might arise and therefore needs to increase taxation of income and wealth, it should not be allowed to do so. If government can impose a tax on the rich to pay for free education (like Jeremy Corbyn proposed), the same government should be able to increase tax on the poor to pay for free health\"\n\n.\n\nThe author states that the House of Lords was stating that it \"was taking a different viewpoint from the Labour Party. If the Lords had passed the government's tax bill, the opposition's argument that the Lords is undemocratic for blocking it would have been vindicated\".

Maxfield is part of the \"Singing Doctors\" practice, with Dr. Hartman and Dr. Kritscher, and is in many episodes as a guest.\n\nAlthough most reviews were positive, some reviewers were critical due to the increased focus on musical numbers. Entertainment Weekly criticized the episode for being a \"shiny, glitzy mess of a teleplay and a disservice to the show's strong, human-centred stories\". The Washington Post also criticized the episode, writing that \"instead of continuing to take more risks (like an all-singing episode), it felt as though the writers were determined to bring their viewers out of denial about their lack of imagination\".[20] Salon described the episode as \"[a] shiny, glitzy mess that felt like it had been hastily thrown together\";[21] TV Guides Linda Marder said the episode \"was a misstep for the series, relying heavily on the old clich\u00e9 of the musical episode (even if only for one number) and feeling too reminiscent of some of the campier attempts from the 1970s\".[22] In contrast, Time.com said, 'Overall, though, the episode had an energetic, fresh vibe, it was still full-on Doctor Who fare, and the best thing to do is look toward its next adventure.\"[23]","token_len":435,"entropy":[8.8918,3.2208,6.2943,6.2675,2.4896,5.2917,1.2023,1.4717,5.3049,6.4908,1.2129,5.9767,2.0909,3.9794,10.0951,7.1941,1.1917,5.8255,4.3821,6.9185,1.1755,0.014,0.9206,0.6968,0.0447,7.8517,5.2862,6.1366,2.1571,14.506,3.0588,7.9949,3.2263,10.1894,2.0689,9.9195,3.6571,0.0853,2.2566,2.8849,1.4846,4.9647,2.8309,0.419,2.8014,1.8197,3.8732,7.2463,8.9169,5.7459,2.1096,6.8745,3.5031,0.5557,3.814,0.0037,8.5276,4.0283,1.5424,0.6143,1.34,0.3199,3.0208,2.2739,2.1087,4.6798,0.4401,0.0612,2.1448,4.8225,1.6901,6.3175,3.2857,4.9222,0.4204,4.1588,3.1826,5.7856,2.8791,1.5803,1.598,5.4046,0.2484,0.0406,0.478,0.0003,2.8548,1.8967,4.6918,0.2934,1.3221,0.9172,6.2095,1.2921,3.8201,2.2805,2.7958,1.8311,3.622,0.3211,3.4984,1.5037,3.2174,4.402,0.1706,4.5066,3.7018,5.9342,0.0616,1.2559,0.0002,4.8835,3.6654,4.3838,0.1274,1.0949,1.7841,4.4674,2.9331,1.3867,2.2114,2.164,2.0241,5.5527,1.8738,2.1912,8.3826,0.0465,0.9734,4.5949,1.044,0.8514,1.3819,0.7565,1.2062,0.0002,3.4516,1.1828,0.9706,1.29,4.9882,0.0852,6.3385,0.0765,6.9274,7.3079,2.0672,3.9304,2.1667,4.0544,4.1788,2.1975,3.3056,0.9397,3.7302,1.7161,5.358,4.2528,3.0468,6.1932,6.8928,4.3333,1.4886,0.3616,5.9555,0.0087,1.6863,6.8115,0.0797,0.8485,3.8417,5.1098,6.0957,5.5439,0.4557,8.5482,1.4646,4.0141,1.8536,0.0228,7.7861,2.5463,1.9684,1.2292,0.0031,5.1944,5.8821,7.2382,0.3689,2.4248,1.9641,1.908,3.9167,6.0139,4.2598,3.792,1.32,4.1805,1.9383,0.9968,0.0002,5.787,4.324,4.5935,2.8856,1.34,0.7547,1.6205,3.4275,2.129,2.1134,7.7189,0.0069,0.7018,7.822,3.2952,0.3332,3.6269,2.0225,1.2214,9.8728,0.0854,4.7881,0.52,0.9526,0.8284,1.459,2.6135,1.3617,5.608,4.8863,1.6683,7.4908,1.0689,0.0114,5.3748,1.5046,1.1435,8.1238,0.666,4.1163,1.6343,5.8694,1.6563,0.093,0.602,2.2555,0.5491,6.2884,3.2579,6.3832,2.565,4.4818,0.007,7.1166,3.1596,2.1338,5.2436,0.0905,2.8598,1.7311,0.2452,0.3088,3.0769,2.5165,1.1587,1.2578,6.4764,0.015,6.4248,1.7397,5.0856,5.886,2.79,4.9947,2.6673,5.2541,4.5706,0.0879,5.0388,0.0678,3.231,1.5427,1.9283,5.966,2.9092,1.4191,1.0388,2.9896,1.2469,7.5436,0.092,4.9672,4.2516,6.931,4.3158,0.6893,9.0223,3.9519,2.1686,5.2604,0.0222,5.2525,2.0061,6.5304,0.0445,8.7345,4.7523,0.3784,0.1982,0.1736,6.4253,2.0852,0.121,9.8146,1.0811,0.9086,0.0018,0.0066,0.0558,4.6619,5.0489,0.677,1.6373,2.3004,0.8832,6.1152,4.57,0.6426,7.4084,1.9066,0.1644,0.0176,5.3765,7.8079,13.6855,5.1016,5.836,1.1351,4.7185,1.4184,0.2537,1.2407,2.3753,2.2338,5.8124,1.6668,3.133,1.1384,3.0806,1.6563,8.009,2.8362,0.0328,1.7415,6.2285,6.0137,1.3629,2.1685,4.1538,5.8135,5.3061,5.154,1.6264,4.1783,1.8661,1.8687,7.9981,1.3366,1.7678,6.5775,4.1131,5.6999,0.0763,4.9389,0.7734,0.2898,9.8776,2.9041,7.4062,5.2135,1.0396,3.9309,0.0197,0.7342,0.148,0.0261,4.0361,5.9126,0.247,5.8588,3.5244,0.0164,3.4992,2.5722,7.3419,6.911,0.3063,4.6572,0.6381,1.1847,0.6966,4.1748,2.8815,6.1039,1.071,5.4309,4.0125,1.7261,6.258,1.3665,3.4424,6.1767,4.9588,0.6792,7.0827,0.3878,4.4629,1.6586,1.0592,2.2616,5.494,2.5429,3.0159,2.7592,2.8661,5.8711,7.2833,2.8572,4.8733,6.4531,2.5964,0.0816,0.0242]}
{"id":1646,"ended":true,"length":351,"text":"The first factor in the decline of the kakapo was the arrival of humans. M\u0101ori folklore suggests that the kakapo was found throughout the country when the Polynesians first arrived in Aotearoa 700 years ago. Yet, when the European colonizers arrived, they brought a variety of diseases, including the pestilence of European rat lungworm.\n\nThere are two main groups of kakapo populations in Northland now \u2013 one on Waiheke, the other on Whangarei. And because the Northland group is smaller, it is struggling more than its M\u0101ori-descended counterpart on the island of Waiheke.\n\n\u201cIt is a problem only for the Northland population, but it is the one that is showing signs of decline. Once Northland goes, the population will probably have gone for good.\u201d\n\nThe disease is known as rat lungworm disease. It affects the lungs and the brain of humans and is transmitted through an infected rat\u2019s consumption of invertebrates. It is currently incurable, but doctors believe they may find a vaccine in the next few years.\n\nThe Department of Conservation has had to remove more than 100 kakapo to stop the disease from spreading to the other, wild colony.\n\nOn top of this risk, the population is already suffering from loss of habitat. The Northland kakapo are more vulnerable because they have lost most of their original food sources.\n\nThe M\u0101ori-descended colony of about 200 kakapo use the forest for many of the same reasons that the Northland ones do. However, the forest on the island of Waiheke was largely cleared decades ago for grazing.\n\nThe current owner of Waiheke bought the land where the kakapo live 15 years ago. The government has now passed laws to ensure that the birds aren\u2019t cleared as well. But the owner has yet to pass the law on to the Department of Conservation.\n\nConservation officials believe it now will be harder to remove kakapo from the island.","token_len":435,"entropy":[5.3423,8.0946,2.4192,2.1602,5.9881,0.8756,1.7762,7.626,6.262,1.4309,2.1602,1.0513,4.8143,0.0447,6.4941,1.6157,7.2034,4.2764,0.2449,8.7603,4.0982,0.1781,1.2662,2.0038,0.0502,0.0179,1.3498,5.5215,4.026,0.7654,4.6465,4.5449,1.189,8.0506,0.0059,0.8807,2.1967,1.2989,1.5513,6.9155,0.9226,0.0138,0.0001,8.7761,0.4937,0.12,0.3039,6.4278,1.6795,4.3237,1.2832,5.0291,4.9975,0.784,1.23,1.0789,1.2658,3.7469,2.6502,4.1834,0.0066,4.2165,1.4756,0.6605,2.5839,8.3205,0.2152,0.2956,1.4982,6.0614,7.9261,7.6929,2.346,1.2444,1.7182,0.0008,4.6788,1.2189,2.3392,1.6353,3.1798,0.3523,1.029,0.0075,0.0525,3.5869,1.2283,3.754,7.3871,6.9192,4.2318,3.793,4.9261,8.5281,3.6407,2.3741,2.6937,2.4968,1.2067,0.0489,0.6022,6.1425,1.8182,0.1798,0.2395,0.5885,6.0726,3.7791,1.9189,4.9993,0.1837,6.3298,1.1395,4.2521,1.3298,1.7409,0.9417,9.2593,6.4701,2.1702,4.2877,7.9118,0.003,0.0008,5.5405,5.0137,0.457,3.1661,5.2369,1.4213,2.5342,1.1954,3.1435,0.0663,0.0008,0.0037,0.3862,0.8957,0.0002,10.5033,7.9549,6.851,0.6631,3.4116,3.1528,6.7682,2.865,1.3695,2.2183,0.1369,3.7144,1.6553,2.7805,1.357,0.6553,3.6298,4.4828,1.3391,1.7027,7.7351,2.675,0.0234,1.7102,0.508,6.9848,7.0687,0.0598,6.6712,3.8215,1.6148,2.3071,0.69,3.2326,4.0058,4.1239,4.885,4.5573,0.7665,4.8433,7.0764,0.4735,0.0002,2.1821,5.3066,2.387,4.3603,0.7068,5.9135,0.171,0.0537,3.5641,1.4192,1.2619,3.156,2.0513,1.5697,1.352,2.4242,4.3169,2.0166,3.3883,1.5566,2.2271,2.2038,1.4398,5.0931,0.8362,3.2554,11.9858,6.1361,6.0773,9.0837,0.4919,9.4641,0.0028,0.2588,1.1821,2.0958,0.8821,5.5365,8.5242,0.0117,1.7478,0.8117,6.093,1.9266,5.4561,1.5947,6.0374,1.4902,5.0089,2.5101,0.9232,0.6729,0.4107,0.5947,0.4622,0.3842,0.0002,2.0835,7.5901,0.0687,4.0092,2.4608,5.5309,1.9925,4.3683,4.3002,0.1726,1.9704,1.7179,0.0125,0.046,4.8277,4.5373,0.8648,0.5946,1.4921,0.3451,2.6919,1.5076,3.921,5.8697,7.1834,8.7278,0.91,1.5407,0.0003,5.6188,4.6352,0.0008,1.9777,7.9173,0.4388,1.1762,3.934,1.2449,3.8982,2.2689,0.6473,6.7167,0.029,1.4056,1.2549,2.0887,4.9581,0.0346,1.2572,0.0168,0.0091,3.6321,5.1591,2.5071,4.6382,1.1728,2.0453,3.502,3.2589,0.0318,0.162,4.2036,4.6546,1.1622,0.9237,0.8814,0.0002,2.0151,5.2414,0.0062,0.0009,3.613,0.2361,0.046,5.9112,1.9851,6.5207,3.378,0.877,0.0047,0.0311,9.6682,1.9818,4.969,2.872,6.4205,1.2511,2.0424,3.2064,1.3466,1.6799,1.7199,1.6874,0.0177,5.2832,1.4676,1.019,4.7387,0.0229,1.697,5.2157,5.5272,1.4102,1.1316,1.7093,1.1675,0.0038,0.0002,0.0017,2.819,5.9242,3.7053,5.4027,0.0209,4.2546,4.8654,1.3676,0.8931,0.0002,1.8272,5.9825,7.1992,0.2453,2.6249,0.0022,0.0003,0.0019,5.9347,0.8368,1.0228,5.4204,0.4571,0.7016,0.0027,0.005,2.1102,8.4305,0.0429,0.0099,1.3294,1.8703,5.3386,1.7357,3.6891,5.8691,3.2473,0.9781,3.262,0.8372,1.1638,6.0037,5.584,11.201,2.9752,0.1667,7.5996,4.6602,3.8164,0.3828,4.2024,1.532,4.8203,2.2523,3.3917,0.002,4.855,2.2908,2.5442,2.7967,0.9888,0.651,7.587,0.1174,0.0236,0.437,0.1928,0.0002,6.6082,0.0088,3.9234,3.0295,3.704,6.8162,3.7438,0.4457,5.1127,1.2107,2.1952,2.1301,0.0036,0.0168,0.7317,0.4483,1.8883,1.1442]}
{"id":1277,"ended":true,"length":384,"text":"To determine the need for referral to a specialized burn unit, the American Burn Association devised a classification system. Under this system, burns can be classified as major, moderate and minor. The categories are based on the amount of tissue damaged. Major burns can be rated according to the amount of destruction of skin and nerves. Moderate injuries can also have damage to the structures of the skin and skin. But there are no nerve injuries.\n\nMajor burns require the treatment not only on the burned body, but also on the face and chest. These burns make it very important for patients to be kept on the bed. In some instances, it can be impossible to place a patient on a bed. One of the problems is patients must be kept lying flat. Major burns and the associated pain often prevent them to sleep. To reduce the pain, you can use medication and various methods :\n\n1- Use medication :\n\nAnesthesia :\n\n1- use anti -inflammatory or non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs or narcotics : use these drugs if the pain is unbearable. They need to be prescribed and prescribed by a doctor with expertise in these medications. However, such drugs have side - effects that may cause serious health problems.\n\n2- Use analgesics :\n\n3- Use epidural analgesia :\n\n4- Apply ice packs :\n\n5- Apply heating pads :\n\n6- Apply cold compresses :\n\nTreatment of major burns on the eyes :\n\nThe treatment of major burns on the eyes is similar for many of the other types of burns. The ophthalmologist can recommend that the patient use topical creams, gels, or drops.\n\nFor minor burns, the treatment of choice is skin, and the most important factor is to reduce pain. When you first notice the burn, carefully wash the injured area with cool water. When you are in the hospital, put cold compresses, ice, and then cool water on the burned area.\n\nMinor burns do not require a referral to a specialized burn unit. The general advice is to use the above methods, as often as possible.","token_len":435,"entropy":[8.0911,1.1532,7.1654,0.3024,9.5769,2.3093,1.3753,4.9506,10.504,1.9204,0.4461,1.9473,5.3745,2.401,1.5205,9.0082,0.5118,7.7103,0.4984,2.8415,5.3995,1.2019,1.3092,0.0735,5.6922,4.0296,0.2738,1.4163,1.4341,6.2138,1.149,3.4022,2.3299,0.3448,0.9161,1.9176,3.4031,1.2566,2.3106,0.0882,1.0959,4.3132,0.0711,4.7928,4.7953,2.9128,4.5471,0.4913,2.8519,0.8954,6.3155,5.3945,0.0037,0.8013,2.3353,0.0294,7.2924,3.175,3.6711,2.2609,6.3661,1.0512,1.2992,6.859,1.1412,3.8449,4.9385,7.3754,0.8105,1.0332,6.2386,0.608,0.3529,2.1433,1.5663,4.3708,3.553,6.7329,3.3986,0.6864,2.031,10.8036,2.4682,1.1651,1.5775,0.0005,4.1137,0.3666,3.7562,2.7001,4.5884,6.6155,0.3093,5.0449,0.5611,6.6656,2.8861,0.9569,0.023,0.2827,0.6157,0.294,4.5374,1.0769,4.2006,0.5728,3.6301,0.8316,6.665,1.5001,3.1026,3.0513,1.3222,1.9757,0.2772,1.7124,5.3335,2.2457,1.8878,5.8967,2.7126,3.2703,2.8933,3.6519,0.3552,3.2044,2.3329,0.3303,4.3306,0.1978,6.2662,1.3909,1.1029,0.8809,1.6505,0.2517,1.9664,5.1442,1.6463,0.0886,4.2361,1.6569,6.1335,3.9766,0.9344,1.6734,6.2526,3.9152,3.3742,8.8826,0.1682,5.1867,3.7294,4.8114,2.6362,3.5914,5.1109,1.9948,5.6306,3.3176,0.719,5.1915,3.2475,0.7131,1.7785,0.5203,5.2833,1.1545,2.3014,5.7832,2.7158,6.9912,3.8453,10.8803,0.7671,0.0003,3.2887,3.3079,4.7439,5.1411,4.4759,2.6067,0.0002,5.5046,4.2559,1.588,1.7476,0.0002,4.6409,0.5469,5.5796,4.9825,6.3895,3.3756,4.7166,4.4751,1.1082,0.9052,3.712,5.3532,0.9126,0.4662,1.7866,3.5177,6.5799,2.4137,8.2014,6.1636,1.9837,3.8711,2.1957,3.538,0.5823,2.9312,1.7645,5.9417,5.9996,0.3902,0.0706,3.5879,4.1254,4.496,3.3337,0.8003,1.0756,5.0354,3.1641,0.2498,4.597,5.3781,0.284,6.0692,0.0412,5.999,1.5563,3.6105,3.1428,9.0165,3.0295,2.2471,2.9348,2.4961,2.6183,3.2215,0.3032,0.5282,0.9728,0.0004,1.4451,0.0327,1.4991,4.1611,0.5076,0.4102,0.43,0.0002,4.2798,0.0206,1.4653,8.1195,0.1143,0.5635,2.5318,0.9053,1.0165,0.0002,0.671,0.0278,5.7951,6.2893,2.5308,1.7232,0.4337,0.0003,0.4119,0.0337,1.1729,8.3546,1.8253,0.6545,0.2401,0.0003,0.2849,0.0248,0.7096,3.8779,6.4547,0.0506,0.3876,0.3041,0.0003,7.5856,0.3636,1.1479,1.1229,0.257,6.2486,0.5999,6.672,2.4632,0.3873,0.0002,2.8092,2.8833,0.3815,0.2579,0.0473,1.6364,0.047,0.4154,0.8738,4.5757,5.9046,3.5501,3.3839,0.192,2.5414,2.6817,0.0844,0.4948,0.4059,1.8244,7.0418,0.5955,0.5494,0.613,2.4436,3.9803,2.7813,1.5232,0.5565,4.4631,3.9857,4.6989,0.0011,1.7484,5.5946,0.0642,0.8757,2.2987,5.5459,2.0118,2.4308,0.0003,3.7586,2.4375,0.1428,0.8694,1.1772,2.0904,0.938,11.8963,0.3251,4.9906,4.7736,3.2602,1.3996,4.2696,1.6418,3.4416,0.5109,3.6706,4.2978,3.9469,0.7191,4.8862,3.2859,4.5346,4.1318,2.1982,2.4691,0.5274,6.9514,5.674,1.0531,5.2631,0.7513,1.1654,5.1537,0.2462,1.061,3.762,1.3304,2.1266,4.3935,0.9308,1.6964,0.3666,4.6696,5.6393,4.0934,0.0127,3.3447,3.1495,4.8565,1.1163,6.0739,4.4596,3.3469,1.8634,0.4729,3.9882,0.1879,0.3982,1.951,0.0003,5.2778,0.1662,4.5621,0.1218,1.1005,2.6027,4.7116,0.8974,0.3757,0.9279,0.1399,0.0204,0.3926,2.057,5.8539,4.9606,0.6223,0.7128,2.7821,2.4454,6.758,1.7593,2.5293,3.0481,5.108,0.325,0.5477,0.7388]}

In an interview with California @ - @'s WKSF, former Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent Stephen Teret, author of The Mindset, A Practical Path to a Meaningful Life, addresses the matter and explains it may be an act.\n\n\"When people are using what is commonly colloquially known as'salvia divinorum', they are in fact using a powerful hallucinogen,\" Teret said on the program. \"It makes you laugh uncontrollably... and it will also cause you to see things that are not there.\"\n\nTeret said the video has not only sparked questions about the effectiveness of the drug as a hallucinogen but also has raised fears that it might pose harm to health.\n\nSalvia divinorum, or more commonly salvinorin A, is an herb that is in the mint family. It is currently illegal in all 50 states in the U.S. and is classified as a Schedule I substance according to the Federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, which means it has high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use in treatment.\n\nAlthough Teret acknowledged users laugh uncontrollably, he points out many people may simply be excited about an experience they are having.\n\n\"People say they see things, you can touch those things, and when you touch them they will come into being, almost like being able to touch them right now,\" Teret said.\n\nHe also points out that salvinorin A is not a recreational drug or a drug that simply helps to enhance one's experience of music or nature, but in fact has shown to be able to induce powerful visual and auditory hallucinations accompanied by a number of other side effects.\n\nTeret noted that there are no published scientific studies that prove the drug works as anything other than a hallucinogen.\n\nSalvia is now commonly sold in various forms along with the plant in various smoke shops and is sold legally for recreational use in California.","token_len":436,"entropy":[8.5328,7.9346,3.36,0.365,5.3944,5.6417,0.0209,9.083,0.9253,2.6448,4.3968,8.9104,12.2727,5.1424,6.6858,4.3604,0.0016,2.4305,4.8569,6.5277,0.0126,4.0195,4.6498,0.8775,3.3255,3.0503,3.3922,2.0261,3.6694,3.2661,1.9968,0.2765,7.8669,14.1173,10.0999,5.5651,7.7467,1.2506,7.0731,5.2588,8.1806,2.2111,4.1005,8.1365,0.1217,0.2246,1.7035,0.0141,0.0024,0.0254,1.2269,5.8451,4.6166,9.5529,3.0728,6.7827,0.0351,2.7903,5.8197,4.8454,4.1453,9.1662,4.8406,0.0558,8.9796,0.5715,4.0398,5.7748,0.0163,0.5354,0.4912,7.8466,0.9058,3.9172,3.3971,3.0465,4.9992,5.7343,0.9527,3.5364,4.8419,6.4715,0.8201,0.0013,0.9132,4.1808,2.3631,1.6042,4.3477,5.579,2.2332,3.9782,10.2917,0.0003,0.087,1.0005,0.0231,10.3655,5.3475,5.1928,11.3524,0.7555,0.005,8.5067,1.1659,1.5463,4.2803,1.7178,3.177,2.027,5.6311,2.6244,0.0054,0.6076,2.861,0.7912,0.0007,1.5657,5.429,1.5603,3.0972,0.5654,0.2588,2.0855,4.8647,1.5837,4.2586,2.0553,0.0031,5.968,2.8555,1.5201,4.6349,3.5632,1.539,0.7168,0.1839,6.1632,2.3099,0.8521,1.5656,1.464,1.7854,1.8171,0.1735,0.0003,1.5762,0.004,2.1207,2.0543,3.5103,3.6455,4.0946,4.6532,4.0427,4.8893,0.6582,1.0736,4.1355,0.0348,1.6574,0.8552,4.6923,0.5772,6.3857,0.0066,0.0547,1.6239,0.6971,3.3178,2.678,3.5763,0.9366,1.8943,2.6822,5.2379,4.8468,0.4463,4.4529,0.9138,0.4849,0.0002,8.5471,0.0122,3.783,0.0083,0.0012,1.7867,1.9896,7.6142,0.7833,4.342,2.4426,0.2074,0.0846,2.5347,0.1943,0.4358,2.4665,4.7251,1.5624,1.0983,6.2037,1.6345,8.6963,0.4375,1.4793,1.0761,0.6435,5.937,3.2685,0.9665,4.7921,0.5654,0.1384,3.4533,0.2605,1.1279,0.0007,0.0021,0.4765,1.383,1.5298,4.5859,0.2412,0.4452,0.5168,0.8313,2.2649,5.0489,0.0036,0.0751,4.2758,4.1397,0.1161,0.0002,0.0233,3.9953,0.1366,2.5465,0.9125,4.3812,0.6846,2.7935,4.8763,0.2233,0.1704,0.0847,1.6447,5.6477,2.9701,0.1475,0.6146,2.209,4.5818,0.4115,0.503,0.0002,4.7975,4.8414,0.0011,4.3318,8.0413,7.9981,0.1189,0.0018,0.653,0.3402,6.3855,0.3032,5.5067,2.3372,3.5056,3.6102,2.2264,7.4001,1.5269,4.3963,2.2251,2.144,2.8411,4.5344,1.0753,0.4942,0.0002,0.2793,2.8662,4.6384,1.8823,5.6458,1.616,3.1809,4.7174,2.3218,7.1979,4.8077,0.1103,1.108,1.9036,4.4151,0.9127,2.6654,1.1419,1.9879,1.8504,4.2237,3.7715,4.5099,2.137,7.2371,0.8467,4.8448,4.361,0.0058,3.9432,3.7527,5.598,1.288,0.6865,0.6077,0.0004,0.1474,0.0832,1.6,0.0002,3.2283,2.06,2.503,0.2751,0.5007,3.325,1.5396,0.0057,0.0343,0.0998,1.0303,1.7079,1.8164,4.3769,0.1911,4.9221,1.9385,2.5694,1.4016,6.2806,5.2484,3.0617,3.5847,2.7147,0.0276,4.8763,1.3857,6.2626,1.5813,6.8377,2.1834,1.1398,5.9493,1.0755,3.041,5.8009,1.4482,1.038,4.1053,0.0037,4.3325,6.0087,5.8473,1.5788,0.3932,0.9399,7.9219,0.1866,1.7939,4.4647,0.0028,1.3844,4.0007,0.0799,0.6616,0.2178,0.0001,1.7588,0.0079,3.5364,0.387,3.5088,1.0344,3.0282,4.8003,1.8794,0.2402,1.6995,3.1349,1.8874,1.2995,2.4128,2.0436,8.4354,0.6134,0.0076,0.4736,1.5683,0.0026,0.0895,0.8438,0.7325,0.0002,5.0132,0.4831,4.1736,4.428,4.8027,2.356,1.1512,3.7576,1.1158,5.2516,0.0261,3.4205,5.9306,5.2825,3.4586,8.9389,3.2335,1.2202,4.4368,3.0207,5.0983,3.0772,2.1313,0.4039,1.1305,1.8204,1.0197]}
{"id":3630,"ended":true,"length":356,"text":"There is conflicting evidence on whether the bigeye thresher is warm @ - @ bodied like the common thresher ( A. vulpinus ). In a 1971 study, Carey et al. probed the stomach contents of the bigeye thresher. The stomach contents revealed that they feed on smaller species of tuna ( Scomberoides spp. ), while A. vulpinus prey principally on tuna ( Scomberoides spp. ) and swordfish ( Elusor coromandelicus ). A second study, from 1980, sampled the digestive juices of both species and found that they were similar.\n\nIt seems that one can rely on the stomach contents to answer only whether or not the predator had eaten recently but the stomach contents do not reveal whether it was a warm-blooded or cold-blooded predator. An alternative method is to probe the throat with a gloved finger. Most bigeye threshers are warm-blooded, but there are some reports of cold-blooded ( e.g. in North America ). In any case, the throat probes show that bigeye threshers have very different feeding habits than the common thresher, or any other warm-blooded, predatory tuna.\n\nIn addition to throat probing, there are indirect methods for determining feeding habits. For instance, a bigeye thresh- er can be trained to bite a lure that has a tuna-shaped lure attached at one end and hooked at another. A tuna is generally drawn to the lure because it is of the same nature, and this could be used to tell the difference between warm- and cold-blooded prey.\n\nAnother way is to look at a bigeye thresher's ability to pounce on a bait. Bites from predators with cold-blooded blood will be more jerky than bites from warm blooded predators, while bites from warm blooded predators will be less jerky.\n\nA final method for distinguishing warm-blooded from cold-blooded predators is to measure the time between bite and swallowing. Warm blood will have a quicker rise in temperature, and therefore, between bites and swallowing.","token_len":436,"entropy":[2.8744,9.4913,0.6771,2.0107,1.5126,1.7003,8.7699,11.0534,10.473,4.9675,0.8353,2.0574,9.5858,12.9556,8.5355,4.2759,12.6629,5.0896,9.3718,2.6654,8.2121,3.1276,0.135,0.0202,4.6914,8.7242,3.3896,11.0039,4.3922,2.6378,2.5668,4.6766,3.1338,9.2818,1.0586,1.0947,11.0925,0.8559,0.0022,0.3403,9.1001,0.0207,1.3745,8.589,1.7648,0.1497,3.2057,3.8708,0.0273,1.3653,0.0028,0.0214,2.8006,1.9643,3.6528,0.2507,4.4659,1.4536,4.2689,9.9583,1.018,7.0073,5.8527,0.5258,7.4126,2.0204,5.0151,10.3501,2.7003,6.7226,2.3303,3.0957,0.1767,2.2837,2.782,3.2304,7.6387,0.0825,0.3305,0.0021,0.0016,7.2372,8.4829,0.0276,3.8717,0.9658,2.6145,0.9316,0.0113,0.3138,0.0077,1.9885,0.0115,1.4047,1.8027,0.9366,8.8394,0.0157,0.1202,7.8431,4.042,4.4331,10.6924,5.1969,2.9314,4.2701,0.2813,3.4914,5.468,0.4939,1.3992,3.3037,4.0666,1.038,7.2382,1.1119,3.8875,5.4597,0.209,4.6283,2.8072,2.0528,0.4239,0.6622,2.4675,2.7967,2.7781,2.4885,2.8746,0.0362,4.1765,2.6236,1.199,5.5342,3.5499,6.2759,0.1992,1.5944,3.894,0.3329,1.8929,6.2575,6.5754,7.5856,2.5198,0.0027,1.1369,7.7453,4.6997,1.656,8.1639,6.2091,2.6021,1.7501,0.1269,3.3126,0.2088,3.2379,1.7666,2.8723,1.0611,2.2876,4.2925,2.9785,0.2711,2.3907,0.5468,0.112,0.0215,1.2038,0.2435,5.4921,2.6999,3.6573,0.9525,0.2859,6.7115,0.3582,6.2003,4.1265,0.7932,8.5878,0.557,1.7057,1.7488,5.9678,6.6832,0.0974,0.5639,0.0055,0.1353,2.4306,5.7138,0.3693,0.012,1.6336,1.6727,3.3101,0.6553,1.7504,6.7934,0.6794,1.8753,0.265,0.0383,4.2363,6.3507,0.0934,0.0045,0.7227,3.641,5.445,0.7295,2.9248,2.6405,5.227,0.1134,0.0866,1.576,4.2693,8.7071,4.9498,1.0217,5.1063,0.0573,0.4314,0.0015,0.1058,2.6988,3.9243,3.4616,4.7034,0.7222,1.3876,2.2939,1.3664,0.3438,0.0023,0.516,2.4471,5.144,5.8071,0.732,3.8028,0.0955,0.0099,4.1207,4.59,6.6653,0.5839,0.7294,0.0003,3.2055,3.1454,0.552,9.1975,2.7513,0.3268,3.0206,0.6732,6.8521,1.5015,2.0046,3.1019,5.824,0.9794,1.0188,2.5868,1.8008,0.0295,2.6932,5.4754,0.0209,0.8777,8.6308,6.0285,9.2111,2.0111,1.3248,3.0853,0.3011,4.4837,1.9622,8.9262,3.9226,2.3349,1.8701,9.6546,2.9164,1.4319,5.8719,2.4097,4.5465,3.3667,0.2154,1.9321,7.6251,0.6556,3.0982,1.0617,2.6737,4.9447,3.5509,5.2033,6.1289,1.1287,1.3535,1.0332,3.0426,0.8522,1.0271,6.3743,2.1155,0.5293,6.81,2.5899,1.652,3.7655,5.4288,0.938,2.8328,0.376,4.1559,1.7823,3.3876,0.1671,2.8385,0.693,2.1356,0.0357,0.0044,0.034,1.3951,0.3293,1.941,0.0002,3.1431,2.2714,3.8993,0.1848,3.27,0.6346,3.266,3.873,0.0164,1.0564,0.2982,0.0021,0.9408,5.5933,0.0233,6.6222,0.9174,1.1858,1.5483,2.033,1.5461,6.3395,3.3602,3.4297,6.2241,5.4378,5.0951,0.7047,0.0958,6.3277,4.4272,2.9407,2.3361,11.4893,0.1138,1.6215,0.6681,0.1023,1.6304,5.3353,1.6707,2.4571,1.5402,4.0341,0.5994,0.1356,1.1924,1.7339,0.0043,1.0853,0.4305,0.6833,2.9025,0.3051,0.0009,0.9414,2.3983,0.0003,3.0644,4.0972,2.3794,1.3972,4.2043,1.7676,0.3828,0.3215,1.9292,0.0337,0.0139,0.0117,2.583,0.2717,0.3665,3.0594,0.6329,5.0442,3.3535,5.19,0.995,4.1113,0.4242,3.2319,1.5299,6.2092,3.9144,1.1344,5.0082,5.5217,1.696,1.7858,1.8509,1.7897,5.3405,2.8074,7.9674,1.1343,0.8644,0.404,1.4344]}
{"id":2161,"ended":true,"length":401,"text":"Perry's undercover identity as a pet leads to characters throughout the series to deem him as a `` mindless domestic pet `` that `` doesn 't do much ``. This definition of the character's character is a common one used by critics of the series to attack Perry's personality and performance.\n\nBattlestar Galactica (2004-2007, 2004-2009)\n\nA show about people being on a space ship and fighting robots. A space ship named the Galactica. And, if you're going to fight robots, make sure you have the largest and most powerful robot and use it every once in a while. In the case of Galactica, the largest and most powerful robot is called DeathStar.\n\nThe show has a lot of themes: humanity on the line, religious and political allegories, and other ideas and stories. But at its base, really, a lot of people watched it for the cool robots. Even when the characters get more human and interesting, like in the later seasons where they really focus on all the themes, there's also still the occasional robot fight.\n\nTransformers: The Movie (1987)\n\nThis was, back in 1987, the first movie to be shown in theaters that featured a lot of robots fighting. Since then, this battle scene has been parodied many times, including as a main joke in an episode of Robot Chicken. Transformers movies have lots of battle scenes, but nothing really compares to this one.\n\nThe entire scene takes place on a beach, but for many of the robots, it' s the only time they're ever exposed that way. Some robots fly a mile or so away to land near the beach. Most of the action takes place in the air, and the fighting goes on while the giant robots move around and shoot lasers and blow up some vehicles.\n\nTruck Turner from Robot Chicken did what the best Robot Chicken writers do. He took the best idea ever, and he turned it on its head to make it funnier still. He even uses a few parts from the actual movie to make his own parody version of the battle scene.","token_len":436,"entropy":[7.374,2.8093,10.4259,7.3065,3.5225,1.0348,8.9481,8.9927,1.4356,9.842,6.7546,0.524,1.0255,4.4658,9.7397,1.2932,3.189,1.1092,10.5715,16.2396,7.5354,2.9549,4.4153,3.5866,5.1276,5.8812,10.1334,0.8813,3.5257,2.8069,5.7817,3.1728,3.6942,7.0078,2.0734,2.3021,3.4779,3.6527,3.2594,1.5744,3.5139,4.1019,1.4704,4.0118,0.684,5.313,0.516,1.2105,1.7989,2.3671,5.8385,4.8574,1.3513,5.1436,1.4087,5.5484,0.592,2.4948,0.0777,5.7289,4.9434,2.0919,0.0224,0.042,0.0,0.0,3.6109,4.1058,2.6442,2.2558,4.2198,4.1451,0.2982,3.0787,0.5961,0.8359,0.0002,3.5689,4.9583,1.8792,5.0487,4.3058,5.5548,1.955,5.957,1.8556,2.2458,5.3869,5.2911,1.0895,3.9383,5.3948,0.9993,6.741,2.4101,4.0431,0.0161,0.044,2.4075,7.1845,3.2468,4.3611,0.4835,1.5833,3.6451,0.0638,6.9357,1.0158,0.3791,5.1933,0.5581,0.8472,2.3864,2.2518,7.2505,3.7111,0.7159,0.9248,3.5761,5.5879,6.258,0.7971,5.9704,5.0359,0.0433,0.3927,0.0079,0.4009,4.2719,1.8646,4.3063,0.014,4.0835,0.0054,0.0053,0.163,1.5564,5.5989,1.6179,0.2025,0.0407,0.5492,1.5371,3.5618,7.1647,5.8613,0.8806,1.6361,0.0003,2.0833,2.0606,2.8285,1.7847,2.3035,0.2337,5.3688,4.6521,6.5179,4.8558,1.536,7.9502,1.0372,8.1446,3.4811,1.6128,4.7657,4.0996,0.7776,1.6839,4.8179,6.2522,2.7061,4.8722,0.8826,3.8232,4.7879,1.5957,6.3389,0.2909,8.9752,0.3077,5.0189,0.8891,0.0406,4.7021,8.5297,1.3548,3.0892,1.2199,8.254,6.3263,1.6787,5.0701,3.3425,1.7685,3.7653,4.722,5.242,4.9429,2.5116,5.838,0.3234,4.8645,2.1508,0.9008,6.4981,2.5152,3.9776,2.1347,5.7434,4.8757,0.077,6.5592,0.6596,6.3835,1.4837,2.6696,1.0218,3.9968,5.7452,2.8919,4.0616,3.7157,3.9947,1.2611,0.8441,0.0003,7.9646,0.0003,0.9712,1.2432,1.6243,0.2375,4.3524,1.3498,0.0614,0.0002,2.9043,2.0088,5.6544,6.5619,0.3415,1.6854,0.0755,1.2143,1.0758,2.9611,1.9073,2.9497,3.3615,1.3303,2.3131,4.1595,2.8286,1.2519,5.095,0.0347,1.5046,1.9749,1.4805,5.7732,0.4826,0.1788,3.033,9.8214,2.7154,0.3321,1.0582,7.1339,0.0249,3.1673,0.0195,1.5899,2.3645,5.1451,1.1846,5.3328,7.5484,0.6142,4.2398,0.2856,0.1478,6.2381,0.8295,0.5711,5.2883,5.2503,1.7194,7.3966,0.0556,5.4394,0.1622,1.0469,1.1979,4.9829,3.1927,5.7595,0.1245,1.2385,0.5607,0.4842,0.7289,0.0002,2.0249,5.7645,2.9802,3.6117,0.0249,1.5991,0.7335,8.7992,1.7081,3.2503,5.4309,4.6368,1.5215,0.1865,2.4668,1.0208,0.981,10.5673,1.4904,2.4256,2.178,1.4206,0.5752,2.1243,4.5898,6.7398,7.3279,4.6811,0.2775,4.3597,3.075,7.051,5.4042,8.0486,1.8984,0.7557,2.6939,2.8603,5.6141,5.537,0.7315,1.6469,1.9265,4.6821,0.597,0.3132,3.6361,1.3545,0.0004,1.1775,1.0992,3.1784,0.6325,1.8416,1.7649,5.0491,4.5269,0.491,4.454,0.5894,6.3841,1.0791,4.822,1.8631,3.4212,4.6907,1.6189,2.081,5.2778,0.8902,5.1704,6.4104,0.3512,1.064,0.0003,5.2485,5.5991,12.2222,7.366,5.3592,0.067,7.1897,5.8015,3.2486,6.0427,5.5572,0.0812,3.4891,2.2091,3.2437,0.5228,3.7666,1.232,4.2129,5.6953,5.4831,2.5367,1.3541,4.5721,3.6976,0.1871,4.4147,0.1939,0.0144,3.9086,0.9609,0.8198,5.6009,0.0073,8.8438,0.1321,2.2041,3.737,5.1507,1.7604,3.1332,5.5167,1.4573,0.6185,5.6533,1.6812,1.3528,0.6956,4.0438,3.5405,5.6339,5.0926,0.3862,0.5151,2.1336,0.3665,0.4184]}
{"id":1560,"ended":true,"length":376,"text":"Hamels, who is of Dutch descent, is the oldest of three children. He grew up in San Diego, where his parents still live. He now resides in Newtown Square, Pa.\n\nHamels was drafted by the Cubs in the 28 round of the 2004 amateur draft out of the University of Texas while he was still a student there. The deal was quickly voided since Hamels was underclassmen, but he did eventually sign a pro contract with the organization shortly afterward. Hamels made his professional debut in 2004, splitting the season between the rookie-level Elizabethton Cubs and the Class A Daytona Cubs. He had one of his best seasons in 2005 with the Class A Kane County Cougars, going 14-6 with a 3.45 ERA and a 754:153 K:BB ratio in 155.2 innings. The Cubs promoted Hamels to the Double-A Tennessee Smokies during the season, where he went 4-2 with a 4.34 ERA in seven starts.\n\nHamels spent most of the 2006 campaign with the Triple-A Iowa Cubs, going 14-7 with a 5.03 ERA in 21 starts. He returned to Iowa for the second and third halves of the season and was much the same, as he picked up two more victories in September. He opened the 2007 season with the Triple-A Iowa Cubs and was recalled to the majors on May 21. He spent most of the season with the big club until he was designated for assignment on August 31. Hamels was outrighted to Triple-A on September 2 and remained there for the rest of the year. He made 21 starts between both levels between 2007 and 2008, although he saw his ERA rise in both years.\n\nFollowing the 2008 campaign, Hamels was non-tendered by the Cubs and elected to become a free agent. Despite some minor rumors that the Braves were interested in signining the righthander, general manager Frank Wren decided not to pursue him and chose to go with his current rotation.\n\nHamels is a noted student of the game. He is also known for his strong conditioning and strong mental resolve.","token_len":436,"entropy":[8.5239,1.8972,2.8497,2.4622,5.7162,5.4513,0.7519,0.3637,2.4045,2.5981,3.7796,1.7782,2.7866,1.1889,0.8458,1.7113,4.0294,0.0034,0.3717,6.2343,2.3015,0.9798,1.5588,1.7751,2.0505,5.3074,0.2315,0.3994,1.5406,4.4532,3.8981,0.2498,8.3593,10.1102,0.6268,5.8867,1.2535,0.8009,0.0004,8.0892,0.0356,2.5861,5.5703,1.8698,0.2268,5.3331,0.4847,1.6657,6.1067,11.1773,0.8483,0.2116,3.8235,1.7568,0.0206,2.6062,0.0007,3.3397,0.8964,0.0023,3.6522,6.8047,2.1716,0.1222,1.8932,0.8518,2.1806,3.0007,0.2526,3.1719,7.1929,1.2311,5.7775,6.5428,0.0004,7.5051,2.9048,0.0025,1.537,4.0513,4.1003,0.8353,2.1177,1.9424,1.056,3.1169,3.2779,1.4554,2.0088,4.3765,0.2485,0.4663,0.3003,6.017,6.4971,3.2514,0.2797,3.1889,0.0012,4.528,0.8441,1.9244,0.0402,1.0916,4.1286,1.6048,6.7984,2.1831,1.5084,0.1271,1.6494,8.4501,2.4751,2.5001,14.5631,3.3487,4.3699,0.2605,0.5885,5.0383,0.9333,7.3615,2.5705,0.4477,1.2462,3.4591,3.5341,2.8706,1.0681,0.6686,0.3464,1.2164,1.8164,2.4424,0.4712,2.3666,0.4549,8.16,0.7473,6.2471,0.0045,0.6284,2.9103,3.5144,0.046,2.5626,0.1408,0.1087,1.6007,0.0005,4.2543,0.008,1.4083,2.1824,3.2494,10.5067,6.2571,11.0672,1.1992,8.5089,0.0105,0.0365,2.0744,6.705,2.4281,1.4345,0.042,0.8162,3.3277,1.6184,4.2229,1.0212,0.0014,0.3539,1.0836,3.2121,0.0723,0.0001,6.2906,8.7355,1.1967,0.0757,5.944,0.5239,1.7926,0.9481,1.576,0.1139,1.6928,2.7815,0.0061,2.462,0.0823,0.0333,1.8095,0.002,4.6164,0.0035,1.4389,5.2876,0.5794,0.4941,1.3938,0.0002,0.9218,0.0019,3.3488,2.4718,0.0074,1.1322,2.7536,2.8192,0.3635,0.416,4.3077,0.0074,0.0001,5.3039,2.5254,0.6368,2.7897,3.5702,0.0019,2.4017,0.0568,0.0268,2.3829,0.0033,4.5222,0.0015,1.0387,3.7585,0.7749,0.5206,0.7487,3.9266,0.1719,0.9974,2.3847,0.5456,3.8048,4.4959,1.6826,6.3758,0.0878,0.424,0.6285,2.1842,2.6738,6.2484,5.5731,0.017,2.6651,5.2561,0.4079,6.246,0.0243,2.2167,3.6508,2.7049,1.3319,4.5822,1.2111,1.2402,7.4818,0.1677,4.3744,0.2697,0.5744,1.0232,2.4158,0.0043,0.0016,2.5792,0.9552,1.7772,2.0315,3.7018,0.9796,1.4461,4.4834,1.9636,2.5397,3.6394,1.229,1.2585,3.9641,2.5712,0.0024,0.2199,0.9387,0.4836,0.434,7.4084,3.4276,5.3732,1.3024,0.6802,5.3221,0.0967,0.0038,0.3801,2.5605,3.6706,0.6512,1.8509,0.0024,2.1204,7.6248,0.0009,1.4294,1.5927,0.0033,0.0013,3.6116,0.8086,3.003,1.2418,5.4901,2.2804,1.5354,0.8025,1.3481,0.0005,0.1392,2.8523,0.6589,1.3876,2.3108,6.0273,0.3787,4.5309,6.6369,4.4841,4.7579,2.483,0.3441,1.2795,0.7155,6.3058,0.4582,5.5968,2.1808,2.1305,3.1954,2.535,2.5302,3.9885,0.4354,1.1253,0.0001,5.7192,0.9414,0.9554,3.1489,0.1769,0.1729,0.0052,1.9453,9.9534,0.0565,1.6133,0.0176,0.6813,0.1461,0.4646,1.4163,6.992,0.1766,4.5512,0.745,0.1041,0.0034,1.5541,5.6871,4.7802,1.9577,8.3594,2.1056,1.9733,5.9154,0.8048,1.6182,0.1201,10.4067,10.4613,5.1324,10.0335,0.0037,0.202,0.7646,7.8433,0.0067,3.5085,0.9341,0.0874,4.6996,2.6236,0.0017,1.0843,2.8003,2.8643,5.352,0.7332,3.2267,0.3972,4.5046,4.0592,6.6102,1.4168,2.6922,0.0002,0.8486,0.0032,3.3658,1.6646,6.9862,7.1668,0.4693,0.9014,0.3591,2.3485,0.6087,2.4145,2.5617,2.3606,0.288,0.4745,4.3124,7.1244,0.9918,4.1313,7.1766,9.9411,0.4692]}
{"id":805,"ended":true,"length":402,"text":"Liverpool controlled the opening passages of the game. Their first goalscoring chance came in the 11th minute when Alan Kennedy's 30 yard shot was saved by Real goalkeeper Agust\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez. Further chances fell the way of the Spanish outfit, but Ian Rush's curling 20 yard effort, the pick of the bunch, was gathered by Rodr\u00edguez. The Liverpool number nine was proving a constant threat to Real \u2013 and on 36 minutes scored the opening goal of the match with a brilliant solo effort from the halfway line. He beat three Real players on the way before rounding the goalkeeper and slotting home to give the Reds a deserved lead. That lead was doubled on 38 minutes when J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann curled the ball into the net from 30 yards out \u2013 but it was a rather fortuitous goal to say the least. Klinsmann scored in his 50th appearance at Anfield.\n\nThe second half got away from Liverpool somewhat. A number of defensive errors saw Real get on the scoresheet and level the scores in the 65th minute when Ronaldo scored what proved to be the winning goal. Real went close to a second before the end of the match when Sergio Ramos had a header cleared off the line and Ronaldo also had a goal incorrectly ruled offside by the assistant referee. Liverpool, on the other hand, had the chance to level the scores as well through Klinsmann but his poor finish saw the ball fly wide.\n\n\"For Liverpool to get that many chances against Real and score one goal is fantastic,\" said Ian Rush, who scored twice in the game. \"To play that way and keep going was important. I don't think the league leaders had a game like the one we played [tonight] again this season.\"\n\nA victory would have seen Liverpool replace Barcelona at the top of the table \u2013 but it was not to be. Despite the disappointment, the Reds remain a point behind the Spaniards after the Catalan club dropped points in the dying seconds when they drew with Valencia at home on Sunday. And it was Liverpool who dominated the match up to that point, but the best chances fell to Real.","token_len":436,"entropy":[10.2682,1.5677,4.909,12.8898,1.0184,0.4363,1.4016,2.0319,5.0703,2.915,5.9767,7.0816,0.0068,2.3565,0.3148,1.7341,0.2752,4.0545,0.0019,0.0125,1.1995,7.0426,7.1116,2.8669,8.713,3.8539,2.0312,1.6806,2.084,0.3308,8.3051,2.6095,7.9795,1.9343,0.9866,4.638,0.0522,0.0009,0.0001,0.0,0.4511,8.8239,4.3187,4.9567,4.5014,4.0716,0.763,2.1445,5.0308,4.028,1.6662,3.5112,10.0908,3.2209,1.8148,5.2356,0.1004,8.3282,0.3705,1.4364,4.5578,4.3113,9.0873,0.7117,0.6967,6.0086,0.8203,1.5337,9.4532,0.7713,5.9877,0.0037,0.0022,0.0009,0.0001,1.3618,2.4881,6.2061,8.7251,3.0552,2.4888,8.8338,2.4324,5.1912,0.6741,2.5449,4.3353,5.7831,2.2634,4.8889,7.9065,0.1383,7.8116,2.5156,3.7509,0.2895,1.4641,0.1473,1.355,4.0515,0.8528,4.0298,6.4067,0.8533,1.0953,2.1745,6.6491,0.0069,0.3494,4.3992,5.1923,6.3914,5.6675,2.5879,2.8182,0.9016,3.3626,5.0769,5.8167,1.7071,2.8927,2.4072,5.4178,0.0112,0.8978,2.8225,2.3428,1.7379,1.7281,0.8483,3.4866,1.6533,0.3286,6.0781,4.3729,1.3759,6.1434,3.5947,4.8892,0.0059,0.4591,5.2832,1.9478,0.0002,1.743,0.0265,0.0003,6.7305,2.6626,0.1617,1.5637,0.1749,1.7462,1.4013,4.7644,0.0157,1.5645,5.0344,2.6069,2.2843,0.4487,2.7132,6.6254,8.8472,0.001,1.686,3.0779,5.7336,0.0035,0.001,0.2392,5.8555,0.0004,0.0008,4.6336,3.2931,2.5421,6.244,0.0094,2.014,3.0915,1.5107,2.1405,1.197,0.014,2.3623,3.2307,0.7214,5.8373,4.4563,0.3993,1.8681,4.0335,1.9446,3.7676,4.8271,0.0278,5.832,1.3472,4.0916,2.7169,4.307,3.6379,0.2177,0.8583,0.002,2.6195,7.9665,0.3948,0.9928,1.9885,0.3352,6.5777,0.121,0.0253,1.9256,6.0946,3.108,8.1305,3.4997,0.1033,0.008,1.209,3.0145,0.1276,1.4769,3.6884,3.7161,4.1241,2.2531,3.0558,2.5716,4.2235,1.664,4.8651,0.4407,0.0475,3.3144,0.8773,5.7504,2.1429,4.3424,1.0398,2.8618,2.48,0.3088,0.1895,0.1882,2.5271,3.5514,5.3089,2.8227,0.7563,3.0322,12.7247,3.3723,2.4718,1.022,2.8017,2.1937,8.6191,0.1177,0.5018,3.9683,4.8295,2.8026,0.435,0.205,0.0086,0.0212,2.9145,2.4943,3.6377,0.2719,4.5492,0.671,0.7169,4.3113,3.347,6.4715,7.7528,0.0003,0.001,5.317,3.2939,5.1697,4.2997,4.3687,1.2558,2.7956,3.9872,2.9611,2.1163,2.0671,0.0002,5.6538,4.7881,4.8391,2.0946,2.7956,3.9868,4.9786,1.2342,3.8425,1.503,3.2635,3.2417,4.1506,1.9894,2.0515,3.6039,0.52,0.4543,5.4879,0.2434,1.5173,2.0256,2.6477,2.8715,1.0317,0.5787,2.9417,0.4482,0.1075,4.7026,4.1008,2.9222,4.5831,2.7579,5.1763,3.3554,3.7687,5.052,1.1785,2.1268,3.6347,0.0008,0.6922,3.0923,5.2909,3.3915,3.7644,2.0331,5.6779,0.4748,4.9839,1.81,1.3078,0.9378,5.8916,10.9706,0.0156,1.6257,6.5434,3.8828,0.9935,2.3807,0.4389,0.0002,4.2555,6.0581,2.8134,2.3304,2.9222,1.1056,7.3676,4.8836,2.5311,0.2984,0.687,0.0681,0.3287,0.499,3.6533,1.8028,2.4862,1.233,2.2964,0.6083,0.109,0.3367,3.9592,2.05,4.9946,2.0063,1.6335,0.9699,4.0586,2.8009,5.2444,1.2157,2.3488,4.653,0.2198,4.5848,2.0445,7.8593,1.6203,5.3719,2.8562,1.653,0.8489,9.5086,1.7968,5.6819,2.266,4.7646,1.9558,3.549,3.0715,2.7644,2.3461,2.2247,0.34,4.8336,3.1057,1.3741,3.8128,0.5659,5.3266,0.9054,2.6539,6.5876,2.2352,0.9932,0.0818,1.5329,3.6658,2.1404,6.0117,4.3839,4.0916,0.2088,1.2252,1.4062]}
{"id":2072,"ended":true,"length":383,"text":"Walpole was a keen and discerning collector of art. Sir Kenneth Clark called him `` one of the three or four real patrons of art in this country, and of that small body who have spent money in the highest degree.`` (Bridgeman & Tice, p. xviii, London, 1909)\n\nThere are two portraits of the artist in the Royal Collection. (a) Queen Victoria, painted in 1882. (b) Queen Alexandra, painted in 1886.\n\nHis last recorded visit to the UK was in 1893. At the time of his death on 4th November, 1893, he was living in New York, aged 74.\n\nWalpole was a member of The Metropolitan Club in New York where he was painted by a fellow member as he walked home to his town house after a visit in his club\u2019s company. This painting of Sir Walter Pater by Edward Burne-Jones was made in 1883 or 1884. (Pater is in blue) Burne-Jones was a close friend of Sir Walter. The full painting can be admired in Tate Britain where it is currently on display, or in New York at the Metropolitan Club and at the Walters Art Museum (Cotton, p. 29).\n\nWalpole\u2019s collection is now dispersed between various institutions as well as individual collectors.\n\nWalpole\u2019s home was at 5 West 65th Street, New York City. It was a grand house with an art collection so extensive it was almost overwhelming. When he was alive the home remained very much as it was when he moved in. It was described in his obituary as the \u201chome [which] in its quiet dignity and elegance of style and design, was worthy of Sir Walpole.\u201d (Madden, p. 23) The house was to become the headquarters of a trust which was set up for the benefit of his children and the care of the house. This was called \u201cThe Trust of Sir Walpole\u2019s House\u201d. His collection was dispersed in the 1920s among the trustees.

{"id":2759,"ended":true,"length":409,"text":"Tyche was a proposed gas giant to be located in the Solar System's Oort cloud. It was first proposed in 1999 by astrophysicists John Matese, Patrick Whitman and Daniel Whitmire of the Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, Colorado. On March 11, 2014, three international teams reported that the planet might actually have a ring system made of frozen gases.\n\nTyche was first proposed as a \"frozen gas giant\" in 1999. It was named after the Greek goddess of fortune and the originator of lottery system. Due to its proximity to the Sun, its orbit is highly eccentric and is on average nearly five times further from the Sun than Neptune. On October 3, 2009, a research team announced that Tyche could be surrounded by a ring system consisting of billions and perhaps trillions of ice particles. The researchers estimate that it would be similar to Saturns rings and Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The researchers further postulated that much of the ice that makes up the ring system could be the remnants of Pluto that was torn apart or vaporized by gravity. The rings around Tyche would also be composed of frozen hydrogen and helium, as well as a mixture of dust, comet debris and small asteroids.\n\nThis work was supported by NASA and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.\n\nOn April 9, 2014, the researchers behind the possible ring system issued a more cautious statement. They said it was more likely that the frozen particles were the rings of another gas giant beyond the orbit of Neptune, such as Sedna or Eris. They also said that there was only a 10% chance that the particles were from Pluto.\n\nIn November 2015, a European team of researchers announced the discovery of the first rocky planet in the habitable zone of the star 51 Pegasi, just outside the orbit of Saturn. The planet had been spotted first in 2001, but only now was its status confirmed. The planet orbits its star in 27 days, has about three times the mass of Earth, is about the size of Neptune and orbits a bright star which is brighter than Sol. Its discovery has been called a major breakthrough in planet finding techniques.","token_len":436,"entropy":[8.5047,4.2696,2.7542,9.6189,8.1821,5.0768,3.6856,2.6583,5.3271,0.9551,1.3163,8.4919,0.9053,2.9763,5.0763,0.0633,3.4351,2.139,2.2798,1.9745,5.1257,3.0767,1.1277,4.2502,1.8526,5.1248,0.008,2.5811,0.0371,5.1158,4.9323,8.0714,6.6636,2.4127,5.9029,10.7534,0.5322,4.8947,6.9765,3.8942,3.7824,0.5858,5.2984,0.0685,0.0055,2.1371,5.7617,0.256,0.5046,0.5177,6.1813,2.8734,3.2214,0.2006,3.3414,0.3258,6.106,6.7036,1.3477,4.5895,1.705,1.4057,4.2192,4.4317,4.2368,2.1153,1.5541,4.2401,2.1006,5.652,1.2536,7.7713,5.2676,1.43,1.2678,0.0008,8.8385,0.0107,2.357,3.3768,0.7029,2.7558,0.3537,4.4414,4.7725,0.6255,0.8538,0.6395,0.2952,1.3717,1.6352,1.8567,2.2681,0.6082,4.965,0.9186,1.162,4.2757,2.4251,0.6501,5.4101,1.7942,2.6585,6.3386,0.7126,0.0074,11.3305,6.0773,0.7238,6.4575,0.0214,0.9186,3.7475,0.0325,0.6795,0.897,0.3623,3.4802,3.1757,1.5322,6.2815,2.7719,1.6595,3.5281,6.6531,1.9337,4.4635,4.534,0.3532,4.7256,1.1297,0.3402,0.6469,0.1017,5.0164,0.3801,4.8976,3.9863,3.5373,0.1279,3.3525,0.1631,2.5223,5.5601,0.1017,4.3642,0.3638,1.7319,0.0063,2.3216,0.8248,6.4294,0.1011,1.327,2.0325,0.4116,3.7809,0.0494,5.8669,5.3049,5.15,1.4573,0.0184,3.5551,3.8939,0.801,2.0398,2.7866,4.9819,0.2154,2.0913,1.3924,1.5018,6.6116,0.3473,3.5376,9.3586,2.1885,2.4436,3.7642,0.4433,7.1154,0.2951,0.0092,0.7379,2.5255,3.0041,5.3088,8.0837,0.4003,0.1415,8.1093,0.3387,0.4106,2.4827,3.9532,4.8395,0.1695,0.5683,1.4674,0.2286,1.6648,0.6423,4.1227,2.1762,0.0177,7.6371,5.3864,2.7385,6.9043,0.3958,5.6986,7.1577,0.0451,0.849,7.2077,0.7852,2.1578,4.3328,4.9181,0.82,0.0056,1.989,2.7922,1.4792,5.045,0.0357,4.5348,3.9552,1.2725,0.4259,1.6167,2.929,0.1028,0.0039,2.6631,2.5138,0.0218,5.3551,1.9597,8.5303,2.0307,0.6921,5.2398,2.1528,0.4295,0.728,0.0002,4.5674,5.0818,0.6347,0.544,0.2696,1.95,2.7326,0.938,6.7999,0.0759,2.0375,0.009,0.47,0.133,0.7589,0.717,0.0003,6.3065,2.6322,3.1933,0.0455,1.3456,0.1891,1.6281,4.8082,7.4252,0.6815,9.595,1.9273,0.1491,5.8085,0.4369,7.7699,5.169,0.7749,1.723,1.8212,1.8862,3.9673,1.2837,4.2875,0.2944,0.395,1.1017,6.4551,4.2497,2.6323,1.9923,8.2678,1.1029,5.7119,3.5083,0.379,8.4684,0.8095,4.6254,0.0505,2.1332,1.5975,4.4475,0.01,7.86,0.0417,1.1255,3.367,1.8434,0.4145,2.3843,1.5369,1.4004,0.6791,3.0978,1.4328,4.6788,1.5808,5.3,0.72,0.0462,0.331,0.9711,4.1411,1.332,3.1062,4.7684,1.1741,0.8596,0.0003,3.2347,4.6894,2.6691,0.1218,2.4096,4.9565,1.1997,3.4755,1.5082,2.409,2.8362,0.7038,0.1598,2.0257,2.726,5.2784,2.5877,1.2609,0.2605,3.2646,0.0352,0.3612,0.6971,5.2838,13.077,0.5659,0.0566,1.46,4.5569,2.4527,0.8593,3.4594,0.0099,4.2537,0.3629,1.2243,2.6265,3.9375,0.9777,3.4568,7.6227,1.8393,4.6436,1.8777,1.7907,3.2273,4.6788,2.4245,3.0598,4.0099,1.7927,0.6904,1.5714,3.0755,4.2782,3.5877,2.0506,2.7406,7.7601,3.317,1.131,6.3978,3.8711,4.3286,0.4173,0.2203,0.3838,0.0366,1.3332,0.6773,2.6975,1.511,3.7335,0.8091,0.01,3.741,0.5231,2.1791,2.7269,4.3149,0.2596,5.3877,0.963,6.2519,0.2105,11.3902,0.5326,3.8883,6.1085,2.7377,1.6428,4.1326,2.3257,3.4944,1.7218,0.5662,6.3911,6.9213,6.9803,0.4875]}

{"id":4606,"ended":true,"length":402,"text":"In August 1941, Rowell returned to Australia to take up the post of Deputy Chief of the General Staff ( DCGS ), with the rank of major general. He expected that his new post would occupy him for between one and two years. Instead, his service lasted until the Japanese entered Manchuria in September, 1941, after which events in China became largely irrelevant.\n\nIn spite of the impending Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the DCGS was told by General Douglas MacArthur, American Commander-in-Chief in the Southwest, that he would make no attempt to prevent the Japanese invasion if Rowell approved of such an action and did not object to the deployment of the Australian force against the Japanese if it had to deal with the Chinese. Rowell gave his approval.\n\nDuring the early stages of the Japanese invasion of China, Rowell was on leave in Europe :\n\nI spent most of a period of about 30 days in Paris in July and August and was in the French capital and had opportunities of conversing with both French and Belgian officers and with senior staff of the French Government and the Belgian Government. On the whole, my impression was that British attitudes had not changed much since 1939. I had also some opportunity of looking at German propaganda posters which have been very common in the Belgian and French capitals. My impression is that the German attitude in Europe is better than the British attitude in Europe [and that] the Germans have not developed the same spirit of appeasement as the British...\n\nRowell's term as DCGS ended in April 1942 and he resumed his previous role as Chief of Staff at the Australian War Memorial and Library, Canberra. His term there was interrupted by illness from 19 January to 1 March 1943 ; by the end of the war, he was a Major-General. He left the Army in 1946 and was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath ( CB ) in 1947.\n\nRowell married E. A. Williams in December 1911. They had three sons and two daughters.\n\nThis article has been reproduced in permission with thanks from The First World War Centenary Commission.

If @ - @ gets to stay late at home, that free-time will then pay for @ - @ to get paid for these hours. @ - @ now drives home after getting off work at @ - @. @ - @ gets home at ~6pm, so if @ - @ is willing to spend a few hours after work watching over the kids, @ - @ can stay up ~3 hours less and get paid for these hours.\n\nThis arrangement will help @ - @ get more days at home with the kids, and free up money for @ - @.","token_len":437,"entropy":[9.0951,9.6503,8.0769,3.6752,7.2265,3.6205,1.7504,0.7086,6.7124,10.6837,13.2452,7.9612,3.5702,5.2547,0.4219,5.0428,4.4818,2.387,0.1467,4.7456,1.9731,6.0212,1.2061,2.5214,2.9128,5.9269,0.0792,1.1117,3.976,3.4186,5.9619,1.5757,1.0483,0.2769,1.5327,0.2049,2.9836,3.1508,2.9131,2.6512,5.0855,2.5386,5.5704,1.0706,7.3728,0.7318,6.7482,3.0721,4.9092,2.4977,0.4172,0.405,0.798,1.099,3.2685,3.067,3.2254,1.9936,5.8152,1.4758,0.4526,9.9624,0.9253,6.0028,7.0738,0.1763,3.8367,1.0121,3.4271,0.9111,5.4692,3.7409,1.5557,2.221,2.168,1.684,2.2837,6.2537,0.2537,4.2696,3.1524,4.7867,1.799,6.1008,0.3064,5.3676,2.8459,1.2468,1.3904,2.7797,3.323,3.5455,3.8959,0.31,3.2672,2.2177,3.4277,3.9285,0.7388,0.1293,5.3744,5.6412,4.1378,4.7626,0.8481,0.1504,4.1486,2.4912,2.4572,1.8485,1.271,7.1453,1.8471,1.3256,1.7522,2.2359,3.9646,0.6017,0.4671,0.108,1.989,4.391,2.1971,6.1099,1.7017,4.6298,3.1815,3.65,4.1242,2.17,2.5059,3.8595,3.3629,0.7788,0.5235,4.7112,5.1331,1.8359,1.4905,4.2111,4.7597,5.1172,4.2637,3.7746,0.1124,1.4089,3.1031,0.096,4.3531,0.5666,0.131,4.2722,5.8926,2.7266,1.686,5.5238,1.5789,0.4483,0.2688,3.5051,1.076,1.1997,1.1014,4.5188,5.5305,3.3951,1.3759,4.0013,1.9466,1.2521,7.4755,0.6164,3.5402,1.6336,0.6812,4.2121,2.2598,4.4604,0.0874,0.647,2.3419,2.2141,4.1034,0.9112,1.0234,2.0447,2.0368,5.9926,4.076,1.7589,3.3718,0.9709,3.572,1.4527,0.8831,2.1016,3.8239,0.4189,2.7567,3.6635,2.837,0.0198,0.8863,0.158,0.5557,3.7517,2.8498,0.2747,0.5097,1.664,0.4365,0.2854,7.7557,0.6958,2.7317,0.1224,0.2149,4.9367,1.6173,7.8901,0.6295,1.2723,0.4841,7.0317,3.4221,0.9035,0.2076,5.3003,3.506,0.0968,0.5771,1.8493,7.923,2.9587,2.5563,0.3787,3.0493,0.0793,0.2327,2.7624,2.0496,1.4321,4.4447,3.8568,1.3602,4.2421,0.1321,0.2516,0.7848,4.211,0.0692,2.0139,4.2085,4.5301,6.2412,3.7961,0.6363,1.7878,0.0002,0.7231,0.1644,0.1245,7.7478,0.017,4.1263,6.8349,4.191,4.4767,0.5142,0.0929,0.2397,1.6991,3.6507,0.5143,9.5345,6.0451,0.9629,1.2594,0.656,4.6025,5.1505,1.6584,5.4008,5.2506,0.3572,1.6389,2.4524,2.1798,3.162,2.7759,1.5359,0.0044,0.0572,1.5293,0.0497,0.3106,3.23,3.7771,0.0373,3.2063,0.6884,0.1604,1.0658,4.9445,6.1886,1.6883,3.0188,4.9735,0.0064,1.4407,6.5532,1.1741,2.4621,4.9082,2.151,1.7112,4.7122,1.6828,0.9322,3.743,0.8356,0.0018,0.7791,2.857,3.2478,5.2634,4.0903,1.6939,3.451,0.5621,3.9649,8.5776,6.2672,0.0878,2.0691,5.153,5.3278,0.4629,4.0346,0.0494,0.2158,2.3996,2.5872,2.3507,0.9005,5.9117,2.3206,0.5815,2.6172,0.067,0.1034,6.3061,3.5492,2.1966,3.8508,5.3231,3.3242,0.4418,2.6508,3.6426,0.1097,0.2467,2.6677,3.1271,0.336,0.2398,3.6083,2.4036,1.905,5.4578,3.1259,1.9448,1.4675,3.8681,5.4745,0.9611,0.0025,1.0822,2.2936,5.858,0.0722,2.3778,3.0327,2.0092,0.9034,5.1493,0.3169,6.6965,4.4731,3.1902,0.5655,0.6147,1.5256,0.0073,0.4335,1.542,3.4793,2.6371,5.178,2.5887,0.7774,5.7557,3.4802,2.6879,0.5838,0.7126,2.4762,0.7594,0.3711,1.1039,0.0002,4.3996,2.1795,3.8178,3.4061,3.0401,0.0627,0.1949,1.9473,3.0711,4.1902,1.7795,1.1235,3.1392,2.223,1.2479,1.4145,1.2196,6.308,1.8383,4.7917,0.5126,3.0083,0.0465,0.4408,3.9605]}
{"id":1835,"ended":true,"length":398,"text":"The categorization of Ceres has changed more than once and has been the subject of some disagreement. Johann Elert Bode believed Ceres to be the `` missing planet `` he had proposed to exist in the 1780s, between Uranus and Neptune. Ceres was named by Johann Elert Bode, the discoverer of Ceres, after Ceres, the Roman goddess of the harvest and fertility. Ceres is now considered a dwarf planet along with Pluto and the three most distant objects we know of.\n\nIn his work Discography, Bode noted that this was \" a planet... and has the form of and is of the size of a planet \". On October 5, 1801, Bode announced Ceres by name on behalf of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin. Ceres was a relatively minor planet at the time, as Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto occupied a far greater share of the solar system's mass. Ceres was therefore considered more of an extra body or an astronomical object ( and had not yet been given a formal designation); its place in the catalogue was given as a variable companion of Mercury, which was also a variable object. As part of a broader rejiggering of the heliocentric system in 1831, the planet Pluto was demoted to a dwarf planet. Ceres is estimated to be about 9 kilometers in diameter.\n\nIn his 1804 Uranometria, Bode argued that Ceres was the largest of the major celestial spheres; as the object was named after Ceres, of course it must be a true planet. During the first half of the 20th century, however, the mass and orbital properties of the solar system were considered in order to establish the rules of classical planetology. Under the current regime of planetology defined by the International Astronomical Union in 1979, Ceres had been removed from the list of planets, as it had not fulfilled the proper definition of a planet as the biggest one in the Solar System, as stated in the 1745 IAU decree of Ptolemy. At this point, it is thought that Ceres was closer to the solar system's outskirts than modern planetary satellites and even comets.","token_len":437,"entropy":[11.7884,0.7253,0.4901,12.4544,3.7188,3.8237,6.0458,0.6956,3.123,3.933,2.5863,1.7335,4.0021,0.6945,0.0027,4.2983,5.3528,1.2181,12.1461,7.5804,9.2864,8.0895,5.0243,8.433,4.1426,1.8081,0.3122,1.8687,10.9267,13.3277,4.2457,4.0717,8.6105,3.0268,4.4469,2.6812,10.6928,1.4982,1.3159,4.5817,2.8905,0.181,1.5326,8.0777,8.3717,0.0187,0.1153,0.3,0.5838,6.4584,1.2577,4.5111,3.2257,4.1891,2.1309,0.004,0.5465,0.0022,2.2703,2.271,8.5419,0.0307,0.0074,0.0782,4.5299,0.8489,2.297,7.5158,1.9898,0.9314,6.6281,2.2504,0.3204,2.3369,5.1005,2.1027,2.7785,1.2281,4.5329,1.648,3.0945,2.9262,1.9444,3.3326,0.0118,7.3037,0.2815,2.1839,1.2804,2.4468,5.4141,5.3801,1.4415,3.2161,5.7267,0.3904,0.306,0.7709,1.6971,0.1193,3.1069,4.3636,4.901,8.1431,6.3771,1.9793,2.0074,0.0067,4.2379,0.4578,4.9726,2.7945,4.2804,4.9231,4.9487,6.581,4.5426,5.9941,3.4275,4.8326,0.2543,8.705,2.5123,3.9592,1.8127,4.9746,0.4788,0.9141,2.9165,6.3488,5.2349,4.3886,3.2401,0.2056,2.2968,4.3822,0.306,1.145,0.0045,4.9565,5.2494,6.7264,1.533,3.9818,5.6775,0.0017,1.1677,5.3785,0.2152,0.5936,2.4059,6.0309,0.6545,5.6619,0.712,2.8832,5.3374,3.6513,1.1837,3.8422,1.0187,0.0745,0.8022,4.0333,5.4834,2.8662,0.6039,0.7435,0.9162,0.0008,0.8706,0.5956,0.6679,0.9886,5.9417,2.4392,5.4511,2.5608,2.4699,0.0096,0.3252,2.2709,0.1174,0.7649,2.2987,1.3597,3.8635,0.8482,4.8342,2.3484,4.2742,2.4572,2.0789,6.4819,5.6617,5.4176,3.2655,6.5127,1.8251,5.0318,8.382,5.4504,3.2625,1.1041,0.5081,6.568,1.3559,5.1834,0.9226,5.0812,3.4638,4.8755,0.5185,0.2733,6.0884,1.6076,4.13,2.2407,1.4179,6.95,6.4339,2.095,3.7398,1.4706,2.8229,1.4042,3.127,1.8729,2.1595,3.3663,0.6589,4.5065,4.3396,0.001,3.1601,4.3003,7.0186,8.3484,2.0459,0.3014,0.1941,0.4763,8.5753,0.1266,0.4038,0.0004,1.2768,3.9548,2.6621,4.5189,0.2681,1.6987,6.3213,5.3278,0.4349,6.4208,0.4088,0.6465,1.1157,3.7656,0.0518,1.9107,5.3942,3.1999,6.3079,0.0888,1.1492,1.8361,4.2302,4.7183,1.2921,0.0962,1.5452,0.6221,0.0003,2.2567,2.8292,2.9484,5.8415,10.0387,7.1828,2.8811,1.7228,0.7263,0.0061,4.4922,0.1623,1.496,0.7527,2.1025,3.8368,2.329,0.6179,5.421,3.4182,9.3049,4.3557,4.148,2.4889,5.1634,1.5741,4.5891,0.8195,3.9533,0.4489,7.2605,1.1535,1.4113,4.1465,1.6106,2.5846,5.0993,2.2498,0.6665,6.1551,0.8802,3.7927,1.4301,0.0049,0.2395,1.9351,0.0076,0.1738,0.4198,2.4139,0.0019,1.6057,6.0817,2.7979,4.511,4.1183,0.0446,1.3321,4.5333,0.0385,1.7105,4.7114,4.4066,5.4447,0.4403,4.8479,1.4233,8.2123,0.8038,6.6249,6.9578,1.6252,0.5041,7.2511,1.2488,4.6836,4.6899,1.8223,5.1356,0.8548,8.2221,0.6684,1.185,3.0356,0.6057,0.0015,0.0066,3.7406,4.4298,0.1792,2.8377,4.0052,1.8188,5.867,0.2489,0.1908,1.9192,0.2052,2.0809,3.0395,3.1964,1.2948,1.7153,1.3682,6.922,0.8699,6.9779,3.8701,0.7884,0.5521,0.7185,4.3468,3.1189,7.3841,3.812,1.8588,0.3094,2.7055,0.023,2.5817,2.9808,4.5781,0.9346,0.7602,4.6132,7.1217,6.6164,0.0499,6.2907,2.961,5.512,0.2944,0.0017,0.0949,1.0651,5.1391,2.5293,1.2331,0.453,2.7124,2.7783,3.9725,0.2776,1.7729,1.0664,6.9723,0.1444,1.2712,4.1759,0.0333,1.8267,6.4993,0.7586,9.0624,3.0742,4.3626,2.9416,4.4588,7.6353,0.0086,0.6882]}

An attempt was made at a revival between 3 January and 28 March 1954.\n\nThe Bulldog Drummond character appears to have first appeared in 1927. The first recorded programme to use the name, on 14 June 1927, was probably sponsored by Western Union.\n\nA variety of radio programmes have used the Bulldog Drummond name; the most prolific being The Bulldog Drummond Show, Bulldog Drummond, and, the later one being a very faithful revival of the earlier Bulldog and Bess radio play series.\n\nBulldog and Bess is an English radio series written by Frederick Seidel and aired between September 1949 and June 1965 on the BBC Light Programme. The series featured Harry Worth as Bulldog Drummond; Bess Drummond, played by Peggy Cummins, was his secretary. The series was later repeated on LBC.\n\n\"Bulldog Drummond and his team of investigative reporters were back on British radio in the early 1950s in Bulldog Drummond and His Private Eye. The series featured Harry Worth as the suave private investigator.\"\n\n\"Bulldog Drummond was the suave private eye, who, as a veteran of the First World War, had been sent to England to check up on the mysterious disappearance of his friend and fellow veteran Private John.\n\nIn The Case of the Stolen Diamond Necklace, Bulldog and Bess are sent to London to help a married rich couple, Mr and Mrs. Pye, who are trying to recover their late relative's stolen necklace.

Her first film appearance was in \"The Devil and Daniel Webster (1929)\" while she has appeared in such films as The Women (1933), All Through the Night (1946), and I Want to Live! (1950).\n\nShe got to be a stage actress at age 8 and she worked at this occupation until she came into attention with her first film and that of playing one of the first roles of a deaf woman in the movie version of Stendhal (1929).\n\nThe only film where she won a special place in history as the last film to star Charlie Chaplin was A King in New York (1937). She has appeared in films like \"Annie Get Your Gun\" (1924) and many others.\n\nIt is not very often that we have a woman like her, a woman who has appeared in such a diverse and varied repertoire, who with her intelligence and talent could have appeared in other places of the world. We must not forget that she was a star, an international star, she was a legend.\n\nA movie that I think was her best as well as the last film she did with Charlie Chaplin is the movie where she played the mother of Chaplin's character in \"The Gold Rush\" (1924).\n\nShe married Edward Van Sloan but for many of the other films she was with John Barrymore.\n\nIn 1944 she was forced to retire and after her retirement she started to play classical music in a theater in Paris.\n\nShe has received many awards.\n\nI hope she got into some of Chaplin's private papers so that some of his works could be found and shown.\n\nOne of the roles I would like to see her play is that of the mother of Pauline, the character who is married to Chaplin's character.\n\nFor me, she will always be the best version of the Mother Superior.","token_len":437,"entropy":[4.4026,2.1546,11.2461,1.3425,2.0052,8.5292,5.9328,2.9656,4.6181,0.0377,1.3028,1.5403,4.0898,3.4373,0.0163,0.5327,5.0048,4.018,0.7984,1.6523,2.6428,1.346,10.5034,4.8303,7.3277,10.8887,2.5011,1.7188,9.4754,0.2397,3.3605,7.5805,9.7227,0.5755,4.7297,3.1385,1.5076,2.9825,1.1575,2.9002,5.1246,6.3602,7.6275,3.7436,5.3728,0.5041,4.3901,2.1858,1.4689,6.297,0.6128,0.8202,5.2204,2.9519,5.7146,2.7564,9.9834,5.0327,3.7087,1.1395,3.2403,1.2804,6.3834,1.0758,7.7504,3.4389,0.5376,5.8025,0.4391,0.0379,2.682,7.5968,3.2036,0.444,2.9227,0.795,6.3132,5.5874,0.2017,2.4205,0.0491,0.1246,4.6131,0.4432,1.3779,4.8792,3.9116,1.0086,3.9935,5.5048,0.061,3.298,0.1434,1.5704,0.04,2.9092,6.7104,4.2593,2.6096,1.4218,6.446,0.7833,2.8161,1.989,4.6931,1.933,3.9658,4.2537,2.8085,6.4974,7.9121,1.8469,0.8166,5.1098,4.0696,8.8941,3.1996,1.0561,3.4001,1.1038,4.5119,4.537,1.6722,8.3229,5.3821,0.1982,0.602,3.9076,4.5151,2.0228,2.6086,7.8085,1.7153,0.8889,1.4171,2.9717,5.2859,0.2597,6.0968,5.9884,0.2664,1.6229,0.941,3.425,0.4147,1.7231,0.0002,3.4777,4.6812,4.4765,4.5001,0.6023,4.8739,1.9035,5.9146,4.7329,0.8645,3.5254,2.9522,1.7776,4.7677,5.1431,1.2955,4.6772,10.589,0.4963,0.0001,0.7123,5.2709,7.844,2.2671,6.0298,0.0153,0.9758,0.3932,3.7223,0.7921,1.9663,2.6136,2.2862,0.3227,4.1239,2.0036,2.0383,5.68,2.408,8.4516,3.5175,3.2064,0.4579,0.4082,0.2868,6.7597,0.7523,0.1214,6.7906,0.9296,0.6989,0.7567,0.0002,4.93,0.9817,2.7645,6.2327,2.1497,0.4024,3.8774,3.3714,1.7391,2.1426,4.5336,2.559,2.1917,5.2469,2.012,0.5945,1.3163,4.0962,0.4088,2.3437,3.4633,4.4357,2.4656,2.6529,5.0821,2.0855,2.4488,7.3657,1.9654,6.3665,0.7216,2.7913,3.8721,1.6622,4.6756,0.7047,4.9653,5.6754,3.9439,1.2838,0.2641,0.818,3.7579,4.5944,2.7601,0.3813,0.5835,1.5681,1.092,1.8228,5.3706,2.8665,3.3369,4.012,1.3319,0.5296,5.3641,0.6638,1.0252,4.9066,1.6488,1.2102,0.0003,3.9173,5.8488,2.4256,3.6974,2.8465,3.1397,3.9152,2.8124,5.9087,2.9993,0.9485,1.6151,2.6362,2.3727,1.67,2.7431,3.9562,2.6966,0.0187,0.0011,2.2092,2.8344,3.8002,5.4144,0.2928,2.6965,1.4346,5.2188,0.3555,6.9928,0.0038,1.117,3.6946,2.2006,1.8098,1.253,7.6315,1.2085,1.2509,0.3859,0.1802,4.2358,0.4338,1.1149,0.0002,2.0492,6.696,6.1141,6.4378,13.4799,5.8269,6.0864,2.4813,3.1963,1.6216,4.0975,2.7934,0.6968,1.44,5.2909,5.5774,5.8171,1.4594,1.5359,1.0944,0.0002,2.702,5.5179,0.927,1.3642,6.6164,0.2453,2.8682,2.9933,4.3644,2.7553,2.0424,1.0413,3.9512,2.095,2.3752,7.0987,0.9068,1.5681,2.3656,3.1136,1.7606,2.8677,0.7488,1.1362,0.0002,1.2608,2.1698,5.3204,1.6037,0.4417,3.3762,1.2728,0.0002,3.4628,3.3477,2.4454,5.8966,3.8333,3.7191,1.6843,11.2238,0.0022,0.0207,7.3595,4.8233,4.0888,0.9779,5.0766,0.4004,2.0517,4.6951,1.1476,0.245,4.2715,2.4782,5.9223,1.8849,0.5016,0.0002,5.043,0.5587,0.5725,7.1243,3.8398,3.0861,0.2744,0.0963,0.7844,0.4761,0.5331,0.7396,3.0792,0.1244,1.5001,4.6226,0.304,6.1648,1.399,3.4552,1.903,4.9132,2.2377,1.8883,5.3436,0.1476,4.2989,0.001,1.3519,3.6021,1.717,0.5277,0.0002,5.239,3.2035,1.1491,1.8543,4.3712,3.5535,0.2701,2.353,2.4883,5.2294,0.0732,1.3947,5.3165,9.3786,1.2909]}
{"id":688,"ended":true,"length":389,"text":"One of the monarch's historic prerogatives was the dissolution of Parliament, which was `` perhaps the most important residual prerogative exercised personally by the sovereign, and represents the greatest potential for controversy in times of political crisis or tension.'' Although the power to prorogue parliament was assumed to be an ``unequivocal `` prerogative of the monarch, the court of appeal ruled in 1969 that the King did not have such an inherent right. The court ruled that such a power was actually reserved for the governor-general, and that the Governor-General had no power to prorogue if he and the monarch disagreed. The decision was overturned in 1988, but as the Governor-General's powers were limited by constitutional changes introduced after that time, the royal veto and the power to prorogue have never been used by the monarch in the history of the Commonwealth.\n\nAlthough Queen Elizabeth II is the monarch of Australia, the Governor-General of Australia has the same powers as the monarch ( and is not in any way inferior to the British monarch ) and all decisions are taken by the Governor-General and the Cabinet. The Governor-General is appointed by British or Australian monarchy only if the constitutional system and procedures for Australia is unchanged ( for example, if there have been no changes in the constitution since Federation ). The Governor-General is currently former federal Attorney-General ( and former Governor-General ) Sir Peter Cosgrove, although the governor-general is usually the former premier of the home state who served as the Australian governor-general before being appointed for that office.\n\nIt is not correct to call the Governor-General and the Prime Minister the `` first and second in the government chain of command `` in Australia. The Australian system of responsible government is such that the executive authority of government ( including the Cabinet and the Governor-General ) is exercised through the elected members of the House of Representatives. If the executive authority of government were not exercised through the elected members of the parliament, the Governor-General would be the first in the succession of authority in the event of the incapacitation of the Prime Minister. This is not true in Australia, however.","token_len":437,"entropy":[2.8006,0.4101,12.1574,1.9472,9.0335,6.7755,0.7021,0.0284,1.098,2.4213,8.3316,0.0257,3.6574,1.3818,1.3238,1.9021,14.6549,13.5804,1.1073,0.7352,1.3594,12.3852,7.0772,0.012,0.0061,6.5263,10.2201,0.6508,0.6757,4.3076,3.367,1.493,7.957,0.7219,3.6041,5.0599,1.4281,8.0906,2.251,6.7478,0.0635,3.0592,1.2488,4.0162,5.1099,0.5812,5.4082,1.5491,5.0355,1.2696,10.9406,1.4266,0.0802,3.8769,0.9401,6.6173,1.2623,0.6082,4.9391,4.065,6.2666,0.9913,0.0183,0.0382,7.5892,7.0826,0.0079,0.0045,3.3408,0.5124,1.6111,1.6125,1.6214,5.1228,1.8302,5.7644,5.7221,1.9164,7.0206,0.2085,1.1859,5.2415,3.5367,0.0678,0.6659,4.8963,1.7681,4.9514,1.616,2.9232,1.6248,1.9961,2.9517,0.4599,5.1814,0.8548,1.8864,1.247,6.9478,2.7213,1.3338,0.7029,6.7453,2.2983,0.0285,1.1747,1.5578,1.2237,1.2356,4.1736,0.2474,0.0652,1.7073,1.9318,2.1169,0.3049,4.7841,0.059,0.0151,7.9938,1.2378,5.7765,1.2108,3.2126,4.6587,2.1944,1.4262,3.5165,1.3315,3.7728,1.6315,3.7779,1.1269,1.3725,5.4283,1.9311,6.5625,0.0279,0.0008,2.3071,2.8846,1.4881,3.6973,2.1809,3.7342,5.3348,5.7625,3.9418,2.7798,1.9394,0.1181,0.9711,5.1298,6.2948,5.418,1.1256,2.7747,0.4792,1.3916,0.0054,0.007,5.4253,3.8464,0.2793,3.4138,2.6482,0.522,1.6194,2.4935,1.9034,4.8032,0.004,0.9122,5.0447,0.6276,2.5036,0.0028,4.4292,6.1595,0.5338,0.5867,3.5128,2.2742,4.302,1.4142,4.2601,0.2635,1.7887,6.0359,0.069,0.0011,1.4374,0.9942,1.7431,2.0654,2.5932,2.3386,0.5519,0.5273,2.7871,4.96,7.569,2.8795,2.3804,3.324,2.6329,0.2785,6.5839,0.3532,0.697,5.0404,1.9323,2.7405,1.3274,6.1351,5.9947,3.1335,3.3442,0.6801,0.4709,0.866,0.0533,0.0009,3.1553,1.8035,6.2216,1.1356,1.5816,1.0783,0.0114,0.0011,1.5011,2.655,0.3103,7.5773,4.509,1.1782,8.5666,5.9067,4.519,1.3366,6.5385,5.9559,3.7048,5.2203,1.6345,8.7694,5.1816,5.3623,3.3744,5.6821,0.3593,0.5146,2.3225,2.7972,4.1676,0.0637,2.3858,1.9747,1.4645,0.6951,1.7676,2.3454,11.4993,3.0887,1.438,0.7525,0.0084,0.0019,1.2427,6.5602,9.7563,6.3517,6.4277,0.9145,0.0059,2.6172,2.9778,5.336,2.4136,0.2235,0.0129,0.7417,7.6593,3.9129,6.2816,0.1729,0.0024,1.6732,4.9802,2.6836,4.9181,0.2489,0.013,1.5839,5.367,2.4588,3.5242,5.203,0.8457,1.3641,7.9573,0.4936,6.088,5.0712,0.8434,1.4606,3.9536,5.9776,1.1227,0.0068,4.1761,2.2714,1.7424,4.8828,3.3372,3.8768,0.5043,0.9703,0.0003,4.8397,0.4269,2.3375,6.8038,0.1868,4.0107,0.5375,1.0704,0.0212,0.0016,4.2296,0.7833,3.8039,0.0211,1.6911,5.3769,8.5386,2.2812,2.759,4.5766,1.2431,4.6177,7.8868,1.4953,1.0118,3.7982,2.984,2.7332,0.9421,1.5351,4.8454,5.7181,0.6794,9.3117,1.0135,1.6143,6.1725,0.1036,1.103,6.9157,4.7723,0.9246,4.5315,3.5201,4.7218,0.6094,3.5115,1.8545,1.0048,1.7833,0.0375,0.0011,0.2972,0.6329,2.6307,3.9242,0.5243,6.8169,4.2874,0.1311,0.7575,3.8504,0.2114,0.2985,1.5868,4.9088,0.8204,4.8782,1.2406,0.6711,0.8102,3.7507,3.1881,1.4185,1.4899,0.3505,1.753,0.1778,0.0898,0.1494,5.4531,0.5539,1.0496,2.2888,0.0091,0.0007,0.9365,1.3659,1.4839,2.2374,3.0547,0.3392,4.9109,1.2615,7.2264,3.1982,1.1354,8.4491,0.3489,3.4142,9.1289,0.127,0.1218,0.7772,2.4122,0.0045,0.8806,3.5842,1.4072,2.3002,2.2736,1.7714,1.1126,1.7189,3.4199,1.1199]}
{"id":637,"ended":true,"length":378,"text":"In April 1986 Yankovic entered the recording studio to begin the sessions to his follow @ - @ up to 1985's Dare to Be Stupid. To produce the album, Yankovic brought in three new producers, including the former Bad Company guitarist Paul Rodgers, who was then in the middle of a stint with the Bay City Rollers.\n\nIn April 1986 Yankovic entered the recording studio to begin the sessions to his follow @ - @ up to 1985's. To produce the album, Yankovic brought in three new producers, including the former Rockpile guitaristwho was then in the middle of a stint with the Bay City Rollers. Despite all of Yankovic's initial misgivings, Rodgers and company were able to capture the album's musical essence, but unfortunately the pop sensibilities of those he had worked with in the past - producer Ed Stasium and co-producer Phil Puleo - were still too much of a part of it.\n\nAided by his team of in-house engineers, Yankovic attempted to put his own stamp on Rodgers' work and to that end recruited the help of a few guest stars, including former Chicago guitarist Jim Babjak, but in the end it was Yankovic himself who would step up and produce his albums from that point on, though he would continue as a co-producers on his albums with Stasium and Puleo until the end of 1986.\n\nThe album's biggest hit, \"We All Wanna Be Sedated\", is far from the only example of the album's sound - which is closer to the sort of album that the late John Lennon and Yoko Ono released in their own collaborative album, Double Fantasy. In the song \"Polly\", the singer goes off on a rant against pop music and its makers.\n\nWhile many songs from this era are still popular today, we would argue that Yankovic's greatest body of work comes from around the early 1990s with the release of the albums A Very Large Decampment and Under the Covers and the best-selling compilation A Very Special Tribute to David Bowie.","token_len":438,"entropy":[8.0569,6.8274,9.6561,4.6414,0.975,6.1393,0.6168,8.1946,0.7823,1.9397,4.2225,2.5639,6.1484,5.0471,3.3633,4.97,13.2175,8.0683,5.0312,8.883,2.9703,9.2019,2.1387,11.1259,3.18,2.6516,5.4736,0.8816,5.8792,7.4543,1.2699,1.6011,0.9074,0.9407,0.0046,0.0006,5.8542,2.1763,4.976,4.7423,2.432,1.4955,2.3595,3.5934,4.516,6.2567,4.0938,3.1837,4.2545,7.3877,1.1224,1.2511,2.1949,3.8309,2.51,1.9788,4.9843,0.0415,2.4782,4.6968,1.6109,1.7623,6.6803,4.9735,3.7789,0.4277,0.6158,2.2327,0.0059,2.6246,2.8738,0.8005,0.8642,0.0024,0.0005,2.9613,0.0075,0.0411,0.0014,0.086,0.0014,0.0024,0.0037,0.0038,0.0101,0.014,0.1226,0.1117,0.0022,0.0515,0.0003,0.0016,0.0008,10.2758,0.128,0.0121,0.0012,0.0017,0.0004,0.002,0.0007,0.0013,0.0004,0.0021,0.0026,0.0005,0.0005,0.0017,0.0016,0.0012,0.0009,13.7387,10.036,0.3999,0.1352,17.7707,0.0068,0.012,0.0026,0.0017,0.0025,0.0004,0.0008,0.0004,0.0004,0.002,0.0067,0.0005,0.0042,0.0019,0.0008,7.707,4.5687,1.3111,3.9199,0.0419,0.0031,0.0504,5.7628,5.5866,0.3327,0.0007,0.0,0.7276,3.1155,1.7811,6.4435,1.9207,1.6958,0.002,4.6261,0.9161,2.7128,1.778,6.1234,3.7977,2.2691,4.7277,6.1105,2.2284,8.3852,4.1227,0.592,4.3115,6.2887,1.9869,1.6848,0.0174,3.204,0.4109,1.3609,6.004,7.7087,5.9245,5.2941,7.124,9.3741,1.5666,4.984,0.4782,0.9475,0.0027,5.2098,5.1675,7.1859,2.5354,0.114,1.3576,3.3089,2.9543,1.6667,3.465,0.2458,3.9646,0.1751,5.3912,0.8978,1.1189,0.0003,4.5816,7.0996,0.0641,2.1692,6.0216,1.0142,7.4065,0.172,0.2621,4.1347,0.5517,0.7285,0.0041,0.0009,5.8142,0.1419,4.3308,2.9968,2.672,2.3029,0.0807,10.4261,0.4746,3.1066,3.1737,4.3003,6.5104,0.0734,10.5863,2.5537,3.3187,0.0325,3.1329,2.6881,8.0037,2.0999,2.1441,0.4554,4.7877,5.9217,6.7656,4.3431,10.0701,9.4283,3.8123,1.0215,5.876,4.1028,1.256,0.1736,2.458,0.8726,2.438,0.0121,0.0011,2.6019,0.1994,3.6831,5.064,1.3465,1.6426,4.3445,3.0463,6.5733,4.6271,4.1868,0.7015,1.0991,2.9618,5.9007,1.8221,2.5139,4.3766,4.492,1.1415,4.8263,0.0157,4.695,1.6963,2.0176,2.8984,4.1401,2.1312,4.2676,0.0864,0.0043,0.8131,2.0453,0.0026,0.0027,3.2274,1.9634,0.9196,0.3477,2.0904,0.2145,0.4343,0.0002,2.8212,2.1476,2.2225,5.4714,2.2032,1.0695,1.151,5.141,4.369,4.1347,0.6443,1.2609,8.8145,0.6653,1.379,3.7185,7.1894,0.2919,1.3672,1.1675,4.9942,0.1206,2.3096,3.6815,0.458,4.3596,4.3522,5.6583,1.8937,8.5427,0.1083,1.3889,6.7303,0.0668,4.5049,1.322,3.9419,4.6231,3.7965,1.7207,2.4251,4.9343,1.1879,0.03,0.0009,4.1486,0.8726,3.3441,3.1875,7.8593,2.9274,1.4852,8.3757,5.9527,0.7654,2.7984,1.997,3.7952,1.3547,5.2088,5.3674,2.0626,2.2573,4.0478,5.89,3.1567,0.9662,0.4042,2.9855,2.979,7.3052,1.8103,1.6847,4.242,7.9947,2.3267,1.3441,0.0002,4.5292,3.7996,4.6678,2.3531,3.1878,1.9865,2.0996,2.6911,3.5534,1.5038,0.1964,5.8823,3.4598,3.6319,0.1581,2.1368,0.041,0.0021,0.4535,3.6243,10.8523,0.0208,0.0101,3.3507,0.1837,7.0974,1.0066,4.2809,2.5529,0.0591,4.0859,1.6935,1.5763,0.023,1.8231,5.7428,5.5563,5.2295,6.8965,8.7685,9.8534,5.1396,1.5006,6.7269,1.4538,7.977,0.8861,4.4785,2.4757,6.4502,1.2376,0.1866,5.5342,5.3629,1.7527,5.9421,7.6644,0.3455,0.4865,4.8308,0.1636,0.8884]}

The board, in partnership with the Academy, is expected to support the development of and use of Somali.\n\nPresident Mohamud said that the move to establish the Board had been informed by \u201cthe national policy of promotion and promotion of Somali.\u201d\n\nOn the establishment of the Board, Ahmed Abdirahman Mohamed Jama, a professor at Hawa Abdiye Yusuf University, said that the move was a major breakthrough in the field of education, and that it will allow Somalia to finally use Somali as a national language.\n\n\u201cThis is an important step that should have happened long ago. Somali is a major official language in Somaliland, and it should be the same in Somalia\u2019s Federal Government,\u201d Jama said.\n\nA major goal of establishing the Board will be to create more opportunities for Somali students, particularly those who would benefit from a secondary education in the mother tongue. Under the new initiative, a Somali language teacher will be taught \u201call aspects of teaching, including curriculum, teaching methodology, pedagogy, teacher education, assessment, supervision, and evaluation.\u201d\n\nMufleh Ahmed Mohamed, a University of Education lecturer, welcomed the news, saying that the Board will \u201chelp students who cannot access secondary education in their mother tongue,\u201d as it will act as a \u201csupportive structure in the implementation of the Somali curriculum.\u201d\n\nJama, however, called for more support for the Board, which now will have a staff of just 10, and questioned why the Ministry of Education is not taking responsibility for the training.","token_len":438,"entropy":[10.727,11.2947,6.4086,5.3995,2.7076,2.4383,4.1101,4.5005,14.7815,0.953,1.2501,1.5723,0.9762,0.3502,2.2221,0.9269,7.4678,8.4096,0.7209,3.4001,4.7297,2.238,0.2671,5.626,4.5368,4.8001,3.9067,2.4655,0.1857,0.037,0.0616,1.8571,0.7865,0.9718,5.0647,2.5972,7.0629,0.1333,4.3733,2.0097,1.8615,0.296,2.3149,0.0,0.0005,0.8685,5.8852,4.4908,1.8924,1.6376,0.962,0.2431,0.0343,1.8405,0.4181,2.2973,16.9958,7.2174,5.9282,6.1208,0.8022,1.8869,0.9057,4.9684,5.6493,0.082,1.1708,1.534,1.2152,3.9028,1.3086,3.2585,3.4141,3.1569,0.6659,0.0024,4.2415,0.3904,0.4933,6.6581,0.6107,0.427,4.5825,0.0236,1.3794,5.6103,3.2182,2.0282,2.8333,1.8388,0.0269,0.8105,4.0647,0.9501,0.3308,5.7467,3.8787,3.4693,5.2998,0.0861,0.4957,2.3903,2.2684,1.8084,0.5084,1.2296,1.9176,3.249,4.714,2.9608,0.0037,0.4449,6.1634,0.841,1.7398,2.5648,0.0009,5.9164,1.0867,2.2458,0.1314,5.9554,4.7557,0.6345,0.9347,3.693,1.2561,0.0003,5.6464,2.7748,0.0033,0.0063,2.8728,0.91,0.7858,6.7833,1.2599,2.3979,0.2004,5.8299,4.2318,0.5846,5.2308,0.4855,10.955,5.3393,2.4769,5.1933,7.0463,0.9709,8.8591,1.5935,3.0294,0.3996,1.219,2.6768,5.0947,6.6884,0.9619,0.0002,4.7113,1.8854,6.261,0.0308,0.1226,1.9199,0.3717,5.0014,4.3426,4.7906,0.5583,0.0028,5.1361,8.6956,3.0554,2.39,4.1336,1.1803,11.1767,2.7983,7.2516,1.9683,7.1633,9.8439,0.2671,0.9655,0.9441,1.2846,0.7934,0.8418,3.8486,1.2181,2.3967,4.4258,4.7443,1.6037,0.5803,2.8345,0.1733,2.0099,2.608,1.6261,1.0587,1.5417,3.5122,3.4188,5.5123,0.2045,5.667,5.5527,3.283,0.8394,0.6026,3.2532,0.0682,0.3891,0.5342,0.0002,3.0009,1.266,4.622,1.5431,2.2149,0.5348,0.4495,2.9801,4.7549,3.2001,3.8097,4.0733,0.2116,1.1698,5.2396,1.0212,1.2423,5.1042,6.3926,0.0819,0.7247,5.238,0.5696,0.001,1.3042,0.5596,1.7453,2.6747,0.6289,3.5417,5.0702,1.547,2.749,2.2919,0.3966,0.4691,8.1811,1.2773,2.0987,5.8836,3.2063,7.0148,0.6335,0.1124,0.4074,0.0002,4.1018,5.4446,4.8727,0.2893,7.0102,0.2908,1.5106,3.1269,0.1401,0.2418,3.4535,4.1931,1.5616,0.1484,1.4196,1.5217,2.1158,3.987,1.3125,1.1065,4.1323,3.2097,0.0818,2.4446,7.1479,0.6284,1.9526,1.0517,9.7413,0.3542,0.8593,6.5074,0.4382,2.4598,4.2931,0.119,3.6513,2.4847,1.8144,2.9791,1.1147,0.475,4.9575,8.3566,0.5017,4.1702,3.5116,0.0183,4.8509,3.0051,2.6205,4.8584,1.0265,4.1405,4.9913,0.3281,4.7085,0.0325,0.0929,0.3953,7.4222,3.2384,0.5352,6.77,0.7046,6.1874,0.5188,0.8646,3.9442,0.7549,4.6409,1.017,0.327,0.0002,4.907,8.6751,6.7784,2.2512,3.5174,3.6212,1.0971,1.1816,4.5524,0.3034,7.2839,3.8565,1.2837,6.4884,0.0893,3.9682,1.9947,1.1515,0.2785,0.941,1.6905,1.7377,12.6295,0.2987,2.3168,4.4748,3.3436,4.376,3.6977,3.5621,0.5517,1.2796,1.8949,2.3182,0.0151,2.1619,1.6202,1.2837,3.8638,2.6855,0.9891,7.3357,0.1028,0.3639,9.6507,0.6899,4.5085,2.3831,6.3271,3.1569,1.0901,5.2741,0.051,0.8858,3.9621,2.8143,0.7426,2.5594,0.4416,0.1923,0.0001,5.3831,0.6556,3.388,2.1549,0.0049,4.6054,0.9878,2.831,3.6799,0.7895,1.9312,3.0726,1.6798,3.8249,8.0027,3.5848,1.9163,1.9623,3.4973,0.1847,5.2832,3.8034,1.9669,1.1553,6.7086,2.5904,1.1593,3.9951,0.2024,0.0233,3.2811,1.6774,3.5997,4.2132,0.0885,0.8584,5.9287,4.8407]}
{"id":4050,"ended":true,"length":403,"text":"After playing for England Schoolboys, playing in a trial at Roker Park in front of the England selectors, and representing The Football League, Matthews was given his England debut at Ninian Park in the final match of the 1984 summer tour.\n\nThe England selectors were impressed, and Matthews won his second, and last, England cap off the bench in a 2\u20132 draw against Ireland in Manchester. He did not feature for his country again, and was dropped for not accepting the terms proposed by the selectors. He did not play in the match against Italy at Anfield in February 1985, despite being named on the squad. Matthews had not wanted to be given only two games for England, and had said that had he got three, he would accept the selectors' proposals.\n\nLater on Matthews was to suffer a knee injury, which would see him spend three years on the sidelines. Matthews was never a regular at Leicester, but always a popular player. Even when suffering an injury that would keep him out of most games, both club and country, he continued to be given a place on the bench.\n\n\"What a nice fellow. As a player or a coach. He was a good lad to have in the dressing room and always the first in the canteen\". Former England goalkeeper Rob Lunt.\n\nDespite injury problems, as well as playing under his home-town managers, Matthews would go on to take part in almost all of Leicester's European adventure. He even missed one game when Leicester were losing 2\u20130 at West Bromwich Albion in the semi-final second leg. Having to score the second leg goal that would send Leicester to the 1985 European Cup Winners Cup Final against Dynamo Moscow, in order to progress to the final, Matthews would have to score.\n\nMatthews would have had some of his best games in Leicester colours, when the side seemed to thrive on self-confidence as well as the opposition. This was no more evident than when Leicester came from 2\u20130 down against Manchester United at Highfield Road to win 3\u20132. His performance was voted best in any division in the Leicester Foxes Player Rating Awards.","token_len":439,"entropy":[8.0013,2.8355,4.5882,11.885,2.1861,1.2929,7.8741,2.1259,3.0169,8.2517,2.9745,6.2336,8.8034,3.0045,1.8523,6.3384,0.0046,2.6202,3.0136,5.3431,0.2168,1.2361,3.2866,6.1427,6.8938,4.1773,1.3831,1.8893,9.0286,2.0568,3.673,2.3413,5.7245,1.8104,2.5742,11.0958,3.9895,2.6658,1.2415,2.9247,4.7623,3.8734,0.2881,0.4069,6.316,5.7591,1.3867,0.8054,0.8918,0.0006,2.5674,4.0791,4.6618,0.0093,2.3585,2.5672,3.3346,1.157,2.5319,4.2596,1.5087,2.4145,6.0472,1.9623,3.501,0.7635,0.372,1.8886,6.4536,0.9,8.1067,1.9662,3.1054,2.2457,6.9487,2.3643,0.0556,1.377,3.4984,1.0816,5.9862,1.3641,1.836,5.0527,0.5434,3.4344,1.5846,3.6312,0.5968,2.0699,1.8794,1.8903,1.9349,4.6411,2.7635,6.2867,8.2453,1.5761,6.104,8.8672,0.4568,0.9512,5.0541,0.0035,0.7092,2.6152,3.6663,1.4771,0.9106,1.4284,0.7294,5.5766,1.0345,4.0,2.7557,5.7095,1.4263,4.2698,1.7182,0.6362,4.7248,1.4027,2.4673,3.9192,0.376,2.2577,1.3632,3.7741,3.5033,3.4918,9.2669,0.1079,2.4749,5.6737,7.2373,3.4508,3.7307,3.1662,1.1115,0.9576,1.0787,2.6777,5.0237,1.7024,6.1788,0.7903,5.924,4.4313,1.4819,0.2991,0.2763,8.0571,1.5254,9.6511,0.0078,0.3328,4.5293,0.5271,0.5841,0.0002,5.7071,3.213,4.3337,1.7628,5.0074,8.8527,0.8569,3.1937,0.0983,1.9842,2.182,3.4897,3.7834,0.039,5.8954,3.1124,0.9204,1.5312,0.6657,0.3758,1.0131,3.8649,1.7303,4.1842,3.0506,1.1378,2.454,5.369,0.9236,1.7393,6.3533,3.8698,6.3489,2.098,1.91,6.3314,2.1227,6.2426,2.9782,0.4553,4.1915,1.9411,3.7098,0.0768,0.3706,0.6013,5.4571,2.0339,0.5209,6.6814,7.3715,0.0819,0.8368,2.574,0.8118,3.4035,0.2869,2.7435,6.0629,2.3133,2.9661,1.3031,0.1657,2.4291,0.9463,0.9828,0.0002,4.8704,5.5193,2.1868,4.5652,5.7283,2.1716,5.3126,1.2767,1.8602,6.3804,1.6378,2.1202,4.2145,1.7858,1.5648,1.3023,2.5372,2.7599,4.3237,1.6488,2.5842,1.2135,1.6486,0.0284,2.5369,4.914,5.3703,2.5419,4.0794,1.0796,13.1495,0.0206,7.2375,7.2612,1.0077,4.6912,5.9987,5.3242,6.7198,3.4218,0.5373,0.0001,5.1576,6.336,5.241,0.6108,5.5729,1.4983,0.0056,3.1158,4.3522,3.6626,7.1177,3.5985,2.9517,5.8931,0.6131,0.3101,4.2281,3.7117,0.0656,0.0133,4.7097,1.8115,0.0287,4.6966,1.7543,0.8553,3.7132,0.1024,4.1725,8.1882,0.9779,1.1197,5.6541,7.6577,3.9777,1.1239,3.8489,3.6615,1.9817,4.5367,2.5398,0.0472,1.243,1.2619,3.9533,0.5866,1.2417,0.0134,1.152,1.9108,4.727,0.0304,0.4698,8.1502,0.0664,1.5541,6.2704,5.6442,6.5635,3.2613,4.3346,3.9826,1.9169,4.3492,3.1096,3.5897,1.1702,1.0617,0.6769,8.6734,3.4694,0.7714,2.2791,1.3273,2.8422,2.9284,7.4183,2.7255,0.6501,4.4802,4.9866,0.0709,6.9955,0.5578,0.1786,1.3715,0.9954,0.9441,2.6451,3.3311,1.3174,3.4106,5.0311,0.9194,0.0002,2.727,0.0087,2.2428,3.3183,3.2414,4.8176,3.1076,1.3845,0.4914,2.0035,1.8512,3.5411,6.6666,0.863,4.0499,3.2287,4.0466,7.4057,0.4235,6.3421,2.5557,7.6865,0.181,2.7131,4.6129,1.7557,0.0683,3.3278,6.2129,0.9679,4.8703,1.259,5.3769,4.729,2.8939,2.3424,1.8223,3.1519,4.4972,2.8658,3.4616,0.034,0.6997,0.0417,4.0349,3.3406,0.3109,2.0289,7.7571,9.4872,3.661,3.7618,1.5193,2.6399,0.0226,1.094,1.0753,4.1826,3.2643,1.7445,9.1479,4.0104,2.4719,6.1416,5.9156,2.4632,0.703,5.5782,8.8641,0.7512,5.7211,5.6458,3.9926,1.541]}
{"id":4332,"ended":true,"length":414,"text":"The Texas Revolution began on October 2, 1835, with the Battle of Gonzales. Stephen F. Austin formed an army of 500 men to march on the Mexican forces in San Antonio with the aim of taking the town and returning it to Spanish rule. He was unaware that the Mexican forces were preparing for an assault on the Mission of San Antonio de Valero, where the forces of Gonzales were encamped. The attack on the Mission did not go well for the Texans and forced Austin to withdraw from the Battle of Gonzales, which he did without loss.\n\nThe Americans and Mexicans clashed again on and off along the south bank of the San Antonio River and in the hills surrounding the mission for the next two years. The Mexican army tried to starve the Americans out and were unsuccessful in their efforts. The Mexican commander, Don Diego Sanchez, was ill - equipped and under-strength. As the Mexican forces pushed a campaign to isolate the town, the Americans used guerrilla tactics and ambushes to inflict casualties and attrition on their opponents. The Mexicans tried unsuccessfully to surround the San Antonio defenses in August 1836 but were unsuccessful.\n\nMeanwhile, in Mexico City, President Agust\u00edn de Iturbide was aware and suspicious that the Americans were up to something. To keep his men from hearing news that could hurt his chances in the next election, he ordered them not to attack the Americans. When Don Diego Sanchez heard news that the Americans were planning to launch an attack, he was ordered out of Mexico City and out to San Antonio. He set his men to building fortifications at San Felipe and San Francisco and prepared to defend the town. On November 2, Don Diego Sanchez and the Mexican army arrived at the town. The Texians were prepared and were able to inflict a heavy toll on the Mexican soldiers.\n\nThe Mexican Army began to slowly withdraw, following a decision to retreat by the Mexican President. When it became clear the Mexicans were getting nowhere, they surrendered the town to the Americans. The Battle of Gonzales was a turning point in the history of Texas. It is generally accepted that the Battle of Gonzales was the first victory for the Texans in the Texas Revolution.","token_len":440,"entropy":[8.8634,7.1327,5.7146,3.8581,3.0493,3.1169,0.2855,1.2667,4.3449,0.8123,1.9021,0.7954,6.3201,0.0207,7.6865,0.3472,1.6084,8.9352,4.1026,0.077,0.1457,6.3156,3.7977,1.6607,1.1757,4.725,1.1925,2.0461,4.255,2.0267,1.3234,2.9726,7.1154,1.9683,3.9864,0.471,5.8211,1.0651,3.6345,0.0325,3.2761,1.6703,3.6439,2.3228,7.303,1.0109,0.132,5.0558,0.6888,0.2701,3.3994,1.7565,9.0717,0.9008,0.8501,2.6995,1.9508,0.8645,4.4069,0.8163,2.4623,1.9176,0.4956,0.7893,7.2501,3.0037,2.4366,0.1982,9.7524,6.4026,3.8028,0.8791,3.2327,1.4418,6.143,0.4823,7.151,0.0133,1.0976,4.5556,0.2558,0.2981,2.1631,4.9303,1.949,0.7355,1.0538,5.0352,0.1095,2.4474,1.4784,2.4308,1.341,4.5391,2.1425,7.3451,1.81,0.267,2.0475,1.5911,0.744,5.6198,0.1988,1.7184,0.0021,2.1614,1.5796,1.9306,1.8213,5.2393,6.1773,0.446,2.1714,0.0077,1.8177,5.3288,3.6455,3.1784,4.5199,3.618,0.9393,7.877,0.7709,6.9658,0.1747,5.2063,1.85,0.0495,0.1039,1.8194,0.5605,0.0458,3.6657,2.6347,1.1985,4.8392,2.3484,0.7346,5.562,3.8287,2.581,0.4203,1.7358,1.056,0.2992,1.8456,2.035,1.992,5.3148,0.3509,7.2296,0.5806,0.9279,2.0679,2.9871,4.575,3.6874,1.9232,2.661,1.1446,0.7446,1.7904,2.8605,4.5504,0.9853,5.9542,5.4164,5.1814,0.3502,1.497,7.7713,8.9697,9.8882,0.5994,4.3751,3.3809,2.201,1.3875,4.324,1.4125,1.7617,1.7675,5.458,6.4425,6.1964,2.7851,8.6278,0.6604,4.4013,1.2367,1.2399,0.8785,5.2021,4.3011,0.1878,2.1017,4.4428,1.3855,0.928,6.5307,2.58,2.9128,8.8797,0.4087,3.152,2.3906,0.1293,1.702,2.6237,4.8999,4.5461,0.044,5.8067,0.4426,5.1343,0.0266,8.2324,3.4667,5.0069,1.1271,0.4901,2.6907,0.7922,2.583,0.8348,1.3362,0.0004,5.3742,0.275,2.3992,3.5571,0.3567,0.3471,4.438,7.0549,0.8352,0.7367,2.447,10.1629,10.6785,4.5095,2.5733,6.5415,5.4646,8.2132,1.5012,0.6402,1.6242,0.5237,7.2411,0.4007,1.4358,0.6477,5.5465,4.4066,2.0798,2.5532,1.4241,8.1887,4.8338,2.6064,8.631,4.6602,1.8745,3.0526,2.6894,0.8932,4.5906,1.0792,0.2967,0.7822,1.6022,5.0855,3.0744,0.0068,4.5953,0.753,3.1098,1.1725,3.9746,6.251,0.435,1.2477,4.2059,3.0294,1.4557,0.6114,0.5908,0.3261,3.383,0.608,4.8117,1.0945,0.7387,2.0612,0.1724,3.2648,5.262,5.1074,0.5452,1.8911,0.3974,1.619,3.9825,1.9174,2.7236,0.2664,0.6562,2.3343,5.1606,3.8843,1.4135,2.4482,6.7388,4.9814,0.0391,3.2588,2.2998,7.377,0.0138,1.3503,2.3968,3.958,2.1105,4.8121,0.9988,4.0782,0.9548,2.1551,1.3265,3.6448,2.4458,2.7584,0.2204,4.0744,0.0229,0.3092,2.7278,2.4082,1.626,1.5693,3.3508,0.9752,1.3197,2.3354,1.4225,1.7138,6.2608,4.706,1.9271,4.6361,2.9533,3.0463,2.1319,0.0076,5.4624,2.9691,2.4371,2.4456,0.2123,0.2734,2.297,4.5854,0.9132,1.3054,0.0003,1.5542,2.2513,2.8047,3.9733,1.2612,5.5475,2.5928,3.4031,6.7722,1.8168,6.185,2.7788,2.8409,3.9318,1.568,2.5194,3.8117,1.8108,4.1452,4.0983,2.8334,0.3391,3.424,1.9848,0.7327,5.1821,3.799,0.7121,2.456,4.6626,3.6156,0.6726,2.1023,0.2476,0.8603,0.7316,1.4192,6.2731,0.0374,0.962,0.0011,1.2406,2.3799,3.606,0.0051,0.5761,0.3989,2.3653,0.0093,2.2719,1.0655,2.9136,3.9814,6.2962,2.3707,0.3463,0.6086,1.9069,0.0787,0.5892,0.0021,1.101,0.6139,1.717,3.8623,0.7466,0.2467,2.2543,0.9811,0.9837,2.5673,0.4543,0.5532]}

{"id":2878,"ended":true,"length":390,"text":"The key claim advanced by lawyer John H. Martindale in all four cases had been that the Treaty of Buffalo Creek ( 1838 ) was invalid because it was not signed by the Seneca leaders who have traditionally held the land. The Supreme Court rejected that claim in three of the four cases, saying that the treaty, while not a complete settlement, had been approved by the Seneca leaders who were involved. But it did allow Martindale to make the new claim that the Seneca Indians had never given up their rights to the land and that the government and the Bureau of Indian Affairs could not claim to have jurisdiction.\n\nIn a strongly worded dissent, Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote that the U.S had never relinquished the power to settle the tribe on the land.\n\n\u201cThe reservation to them may be a small one in size, but its boundaries \u2014 known and unknown alike to the tribe and to the United States \u2014 are not yet terminated,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHarlan added that the treaty was clearly defective and should have been declared void. But he said there was no remedy because the treaty was never formally disapproved, or officially rescinded, by the Indian and Inter-Tribal council. All the tribal leaders have to do to avoid the consequences of that is \u201cdeclare that they will not accept the reservation under the terms of their treaty,\u201d he argued.\n\nHarlan said Chief Joseph was clearly out of line when he said the treaty was \u201cnever meant to be, but for only nine years.\u201d\n\n\"It was settled at that time that the territory would be reserved permanently for the Seneca,\u201d he argued. \u201cAnd by the way, Chief Joseph knew this in 1839. They had discussed this with me and said that this was their intention. The Supreme Court's failure to recognize this important fact in the first three cases today is a grave injustice,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe court said his concerns had merit in the fourth case, although it rejected his assertion that the Indians had any right to their land once it was ceded.","token_len":440,"entropy":[7.1775,8.1793,9.4838,0.5143,9.9317,3.7483,4.6227,1.5983,8.4635,3.098,0.0052,2.1671,8.2837,4.5398,1.0784,7.6763,0.6769,0.4926,1.1081,11.0836,1.064,10.2937,7.904,3.8342,9.6777,5.3518,1.5504,1.3504,4.4954,1.4081,0.8709,1.7411,1.5762,3.7206,0.4463,0.9786,8.7611,0.088,7.8243,3.9996,6.8894,3.8354,2.5639,1.5282,3.5429,1.3548,1.9942,5.037,0.0128,3.7605,1.112,1.436,1.5134,5.6533,1.2076,0.4621,0.8359,0.3586,1.4008,3.6958,0.8571,0.8605,0.9421,4.0494,2.9978,2.0326,2.8263,4.9053,5.5645,0.8819,2.5753,1.5204,5.6213,0.219,0.8081,1.8113,0.0051,1.1082,2.5777,2.7988,3.6557,1.8523,3.7436,3.8182,2.3319,4.2961,9.5167,0.0005,0.0003,0.3395,3.7215,2.2367,7.088,0.8141,2.4011,0.6957,3.3494,0.0013,6.5982,1.31,3.9445,4.7695,0.3686,0.7361,2.3044,0.6961,0.7541,0.6041,2.3244,1.2887,0.9808,5.9489,5.1612,1.3888,7.7131,0.289,0.13,0.0221,3.6338,0.8606,4.1517,3.8223,1.269,7.3073,3.2426,1.0182,0.0075,2.1879,2.6289,7.2572,0.0471,0.0005,0.9614,0.6707,0.4005,2.8088,2.5689,7.8545,0.3553,1.6454,0.5859,0.7815,4.3609,0.0057,0.0051,13.142,3.7796,5.2784,0.0029,1.339,5.4605,0.4172,4.4338,2.4642,6.3852,4.912,1.2058,2.2847,1.3662,1.9823,0.0002,10.1957,8.2751,4.8772,5.5443,5.4746,8.6468,5.0146,1.3179,2.6062,4.2449,1.6289,2.7824,3.2768,0.5747,0.1827,3.858,4.8135,5.2035,5.0181,5.8784,4.6513,7.3901,2.3439,1.1056,2.9396,2.1407,2.0391,0.5333,2.6876,0.006,0.4527,1.0861,3.4641,5.1989,9.7167,1.9083,8.0639,7.1473,2.1379,0.5221,0.2633,1.2641,0.0002,4.8437,0.8733,0.0001,3.9322,0.2806,0.896,2.0162,2.023,5.9698,8.2535,3.0101,3.6738,1.7113,0.1425,5.0033,3.443,0.9543,3.3552,1.4203,1.7708,3.1748,0.6712,0.8391,6.9689,4.1066,0.742,1.295,1.3143,3.6326,4.6776,10.0237,0.0002,3.4305,4.1847,6.4925,4.8592,0.0005,1.3709,0.8362,0.339,3.0169,5.4263,6.5007,2.0926,1.3123,0.0044,0.0034,7.0275,0.6601,7.7775,1.715,3.7082,1.4427,4.5972,4.3267,0.3,3.1453,5.7018,1.8486,6.4031,0.6665,3.7432,4.1408,13.043,2.0079,5.1244,0.0294,1.8242,1.0192,2.6172,0.9951,2.9341,1.132,2.8862,4.9967,1.0423,3.1709,0.228,3.9207,0.8598,1.7872,0.8477,1.7111,1.2875,4.218,0.1009,0.2309,0.0002,3.4777,0.0398,0.0004,1.9998,8.043,4.8312,6.7342,5.5671,6.4628,0.1077,1.949,2.5791,0.1495,1.8404,1.4921,0.9574,0.8028,9.9052,0.0715,6.1916,7.9466,0.0685,0.7082,5.1194,2.9854,5.6737,5.9695,6.2496,1.2063,0.9348,5.7748,2.4003,0.7454,0.0002,2.6722,2.5825,1.8915,6.1706,4.0314,3.0735,0.3359,0.8363,1.0687,4.6141,2.6076,0.6566,4.2031,6.4206,2.5171,0.7142,3.2217,0.008,3.0728,1.5657,0.4721,2.2401,3.2675,0.172,3.0788,0.2536,2.8165,4.354,1.799,3.6808,0.1096,3.9274,0.3092,4.5146,3.0346,4.6768,2.4312,2.5235,2.088,5.7338,1.9459,6.116,1.8329,2.3344,4.5692,2.3764,4.1139,1.7628,3.3767,0.9246,3.2797,3.5887,1.6347,3.2965,5.7959,0.0074,4.7597,5.205,0.0703,2.1792,1.9496,6.3496,2.7024,3.1567,1.1437,4.0937,5.0427,0.4734,7.1308,1.6424,1.9392,4.6092,1.7741,2.6011,0.3005,0.5707,0.9643,1.6186,0.0755,0.2234,0.0001,2.1001,2.7612,3.0276,7.3322,6.3353,4.1461,5.5207,2.9928,1.699,4.8372,0.3532,0.8278,5.6231,0.6179,4.2306,2.4713,3.8001,0.1652,0.5223,4.4178,1.0127,5.4227,1.1964,0.0656,4.6034,1.2725,6.0417,2.3163,0.3038,6.3256,0.0017,1.2016]}

{"id":261,"ended":true,"length":385,"text":"Galveston is the home of several of the largest teaching hospitals in the state, located on the campus of the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Prior to Hurricane Ike, the UTMB system treated more than 120,000 patients per year, and was one of the world\u2019s top teaching hospitals. However, due to flooding of the hospital by up to eight feet of seawater, the UTMB system was forced to close for over a year beginning October 24, 2008.\n\nIn response, Galveston residents, the business and medical communities, as well as government agencies, have begun planning for and rebuilding UTMB. A new campus has been established on Galveston's U.S. Highway 45, the easternmost part of Galveston Island, where the facility formerly stood. This will feature an estimated $1.5 billion dollar, 1.1 million square-foot campus. UTMB Galveston plans to begin treating patients again in summer 2010.\n\nUTMB is in the final stages of a capital campaign to raise funds to begin construction. The funds raised will go to rebuilding UTMB with a modern facility capable of accommodating patient care for generations to come, expanding and improving the state-of-the-art medical infrastructure, providing research support and much more. It is estimated that the new UTMB will be able to provide better care than before, with an emphasis on emergency care.\n\n\"For all of you that have helped out with this campaign... thank you for your contribution,\" said Dr. Jay Varkey, UTMB president. \"It is with your generosity that the rebuild can begin and that the next generations of medical students and physicians will be trained right here in Galveston.\"\n\nThe goal of the campaign is to raise $200 million by August 2010, which will cover construction costs, as well as some minor renovations to the existing facility until it is completely closed for the rebuild. This figure will help cover construction costs of the campus and will be matched by the state of Texas.\n\nTo read more about how you can help UTMB rebuild, visit the Campaign for UTMB Galveston web page.","token_len":441,"entropy":[9.9555,0.049,4.4777,2.4617,4.0293,0.4235,4.4525,2.7427,0.6348,2.8869,10.7853,1.756,0.2022,0.8951,1.9793,1.3632,5.9113,2.1262,0.8977,4.1542,0.0348,1.2727,0.3504,0.0151,0.3189,3.0974,0.0694,2.4748,2.3466,0.0002,0.0001,0.3354,7.9463,0.0017,7.1768,3.7278,0.3015,1.4932,6.451,1.0538,5.8868,6.8855,1.6866,0.0116,5.0288,0.0866,0.003,1.9275,4.1326,0.2706,1.3275,1.608,3.5839,1.8305,0.0067,0.2712,3.9436,14.1163,6.0914,2.7203,2.6376,3.9662,0.0393,0.6479,5.0774,0.0198,3.324,0.0037,4.6036,5.5959,0.7336,6.7407,5.498,8.0169,0.0074,5.646,1.9665,1.7862,5.6724,0.0074,0.8211,1.0473,2.5782,0.0247,3.0147,1.3333,1.2521,0.0324,1.1306,2.6791,4.0061,0.7696,0.2948,5.4293,5.5657,4.6904,0.256,3.2915,0.3667,1.5774,0.0017,2.7478,4.0225,1.0553,3.5387,0.0006,0.0025,4.2159,3.7043,4.6005,7.8504,4.2501,5.3752,1.7954,0.9134,4.691,0.0095,0.0087,5.0895,1.21,0.7196,2.3443,3.3307,4.5491,2.1015,2.9968,5.0629,8.2999,0.0237,1.3634,4.1017,2.3968,4.3401,2.9685,0.1497,2.18,2.2099,2.4116,0.0008,0.0044,0.9183,9.1662,0.6463,0.0125,0.3653,4.0724,5.2736,1.4593,3.5835,6.5936,2.6514,2.8396,0.0078,1.9397,0.0006,0.0023,5.8569,1.3208,4.0792,1.4266,3.7625,4.7382,4.354,0.3775,2.8582,3.8401,4.9662,2.7116,6.2238,4.1325,2.2254,0.7296,1.4953,0.5954,5.6691,4.0811,3.36,1.4137,2.8225,0.4925,0.742,4.2295,0.0321,2.4022,2.3118,6.4686,0.034,9.6964,0.0035,0.0013,5.7139,0.2473,3.5199,8.6719,1.9246,7.7588,1.1542,6.5795,3.5454,0.5291,0.5218,0.0002,5.0932,0.0425,2.6092,4.9224,1.1305,3.6133,0.1173,0.0161,2.7853,7.136,3.6122,1.1884,3.6563,2.5002,1.0946,3.9834,0.907,2.7823,1.4834,5.2626,1.4681,0.5693,1.8854,2.3363,5.7869,3.8694,0.0115,5.3712,2.2238,5.5599,2.7497,7.0044,0.0066,1.9941,7.1756,1.7627,3.4258,6.3209,0.4238,0.0013,2.1314,5.6691,3.2793,2.4372,1.1256,4.8949,3.4895,0.1231,0.0032,0.0074,0.0942,0.002,1.4169,5.346,0.7318,4.0362,6.3891,3.9736,1.4213,7.0884,0.2904,0.2585,4.9433,0.7818,2.1058,0.1701,1.5813,3.6666,3.6779,0.0052,2.5731,2.313,1.57,0.0049,2.0562,5.8819,1.6465,2.677,3.4227,1.5593,1.9125,3.3414,4.6777,0.0143,5.1015,1.2151,1.6377,0.6982,0.0002,3.4044,4.928,4.3631,0.7902,3.6176,2.7989,1.6537,5.0495,4.1,2.5673,2.1399,2.3269,7.033,3.3109,0.0032,0.8314,0.7577,4.8228,1.0802,0.2419,2.2868,0.0181,6.2871,8.7366,4.0517,0.2086,2.4623,0.0172,3.5308,0.7822,0.1351,2.8295,1.3577,3.5308,5.3974,4.7232,0.6274,3.1173,11.4908,4.3565,0.2778,3.0258,3.3559,1.8087,3.4585,5.0645,0.6809,2.4138,1.4053,1.4425,2.2163,0.4571,1.4117,5.684,7.2652,0.1158,0.6019,0.64,0.0005,0.0006,1.1629,0.2492,0.0002,2.0635,4.8436,0.4148,0.6164,2.4057,0.268,0.1381,1.1511,0.3231,4.15,2.4233,2.7337,3.0479,2.4619,1.6367,2.53,1.0864,2.6877,2.9936,1.8542,0.9714,4.9256,0.0075,0.0032,5.8469,6.2086,2.0875,1.6773,0.4051,2.2958,1.6398,7.7064,2.5969,0.5998,4.2842,5.3752,2.1824,2.0849,8.033,0.314,3.603,6.8915,1.5608,4.4204,2.6378,3.8577,0.7572,2.8027,1.4219,4.7706,1.702,4.5665,1.8273,4.6342,0.5209,1.8562,2.579,2.339,0.4076,2.2131,0.7148,0.0002,3.9671,4.0171,0.459,0.3158,2.9602,2.6224,0.0463,0.3539,4.4129,0.0067,3.7775,0.5754,0.8057,1.6387,5.9741,1.2558,2.2384,0.0198,0.5369,0.001,0.0017,5.1698,1.3332,0.6817]}
{"id":5,"ended":true,"length":383,"text":"Fairies became a popular theme in art and literature in the early 20th century following the releases of The Coming of the Fairies by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Peter Pan by J.M. Barrie, and Pied Piper by E.T.A. Hoffmann. The idea of fairies being immortal has survived, and while a few have appeared in fantasy-themed movies, they tend to be relegated to background characters \u2013 they\u2019re not the main threat.\n\nIn a movie universe where anything is possible, however, there is a possibility that this might happen. At the 2014 New York Comic-Con, Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige was asked about the possibility of a female version of Thanos. To the surprise of many, Feige had the opposite answer and was a little hesitant as to whether Thanos should have a girlfriend.\n\n\u201cYeah, I think that\u2019s really hard to do in a world that doesn\u2019t look like us or has the same experience and that sort of thing. So I think that there may very well be. That\u2019s a very unique challenge that I think a lot of fans would like, or love.\u201d\n\nAs usual, there\u2019s no guarantee that the idea of a female Thanos means that one will appear in the MCU, but it will be interesting to see how Thanos reacts to a female figure. If it\u2019s not actually a human female figure, that might present a problem as Thanos is a \u201ccelestial\u201d being \u2013 he only interacts with other beings who are also \u201ccelestial.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Marvel has been asked about a female cosmic power. When the comic book X-Force was made, there was considerable debate about whether Psylocke should have been made a \u201cfull\u201d member. One argument was that she would draw attention away from Deadpool. It\u2019s safe to assume that this would\u2019ve been a problem if there were no male members. Ultimately, however, the debate resulted in the removal of male members so that female members could join.","token_len":441,"entropy":[7.4287,7.6177,1.9956,3.9645,5.9971,1.4695,7.3053,2.2599,2.8255,2.5074,0.3537,2.2812,1.3352,0.0046,0.0649,6.8521,0.6663,8.9732,0.0446,3.1177,7.8111,0.6805,0.336,6.0161,0.0023,2.6899,6.0521,2.3647,0.0515,0.0002,1.9974,6.9499,3.7116,2.2412,4.238,0.4398,3.0704,0.0357,1.4339,0.256,0.4893,0.7626,6.7054,6.1729,0.0191,0.2425,5.781,0.4047,2.5579,0.019,7.5036,0.0741,6.5882,0.5591,0.2116,2.1683,4.8415,0.8906,1.7329,0.0022,2.8004,6.9113,5.1751,6.4125,2.6796,2.3479,5.1478,4.0986,1.8763,2.1996,3.6878,0.6509,6.5112,5.7014,2.3251,4.1066,0.9064,2.6249,4.895,0.0674,0.6442,4.1987,0.0686,5.9822,1.4021,6.0563,4.1511,18.9478,8.6327,3.4908,1.9897,3.1813,2.4856,6.86,1.8574,1.2375,0.0009,2.966,3.1621,7.5881,8.1906,1.2968,7.0088,2.2133,0.2425,0.296,4.3529,0.0468,2.7019,1.2428,1.3498,5.7075,0.4114,4.2365,2.8839,3.6815,0.7393,5.2548,1.3655,7.2413,4.3258,0.2223,0.785,2.0175,0.0019,0.8089,4.1087,1.5897,3.3929,0.3779,0.0005,0.0,3.8568,0.2524,0.8574,1.0111,0.6662,0.1908,1.4311,7.498,3.8697,0.0314,7.9234,0.0007,1.4872,5.3296,3.7311,1.6741,0.0494,0.8794,0.4668,1.6573,0.0008,5.1758,3.1385,4.2602,1.0736,4.6104,4.0449,5.1912,1.143,3.3027,4.7956,0.5317,0.9581,4.6492,0.0018,3.1388,3.1573,1.6798,4.9303,0.6126,1.3217,0.0002,6.1882,5.7919,9.9084,0.318,1.4297,1.1754,1.6504,11.1519,1.4509,3.3236,3.9123,4.5326,0.8706,3.1702,3.0039,0.4959,3.4291,2.3457,3.297,1.3735,0.7426,0.2172,5.1205,0.6036,5.4894,4.3001,4.443,3.3423,2.1477,6.5484,3.1105,4.4552,5.0155,0.0365,0.8146,0.3344,2.661,1.2929,0.9159,1.423,3.3381,4.1347,4.7087,0.034,0.0509,5.6219,4.188,3.5123,0.0809,0.1041,2.1659,2.2233,5.7472,5.1357,2.6107,1.9712,0.5284,4.2425,0.0328,0.0203,2.3745,3.3881,1.0197,4.2181,5.2593,7.5838,1.6767,3.5161,6.5415,0.6477,0.0002,4.0371,6.1162,0.0938,3.2509,7.2653,0.3086,0.1475,2.7282,3.1973,0.4249,2.0102,5.0038,0.5448,0.8919,0.5384,2.9924,0.0062,7.9165,1.0817,5.134,1.914,4.0855,0.6117,1.7165,4.516,0.001,1.7343,0.7075,1.7484,3.679,1.6341,1.4163,0.0252,0.058,1.0179,5.8633,0.0042,3.3359,0.6513,3.3728,1.5591,6.1102,0.9718,3.8393,2.7202,3.8741,0.1641,0.0068,3.6085,5.6911,1.1557,5.975,2.7315,2.786,0.285,3.5825,2.4542,7.5985,0.7984,1.9286,2.9512,6.1744,0.0053,2.1173,2.2294,13.0205,2.6812,10.035,0.3545,3.0914,5.0796,5.1929,4.2215,2.5914,5.9166,5.9113,0.1083,2.9336,1.3078,2.9451,1.2771,4.2885,7.9552,0.1036,1.2585,0.0084,0.5395,6.422,1.2807,0.4302,0.0002,4.4244,3.7984,0.7867,1.0059,0.1763,1.2893,0.1801,0.0652,2.7837,0.2884,3.1808,2.0934,0.5698,1.3717,0.2541,6.9786,6.6928,1.9358,4.2776,2.1894,4.3464,0.7608,5.4701,0.014,4.6777,1.3264,5.7737,1.0405,3.3189,0.6874,6.824,1.7455,1.132,0.3507,11.083,0.0139,0.0005,1.6448,2.2992,1.8785,4.3792,1.3333,9.6264,0.0327,8.4609,3.3441,5.6736,5.2861,2.9561,4.8253,6.7361,0.932,0.1772,1.8201,2.4015,7.9104,2.7377,1.8553,0.0031,7.9351,3.0485,3.9934,2.6222,0.0539,0.7406,6.5814,0.0148,1.4212,0.1296,3.0835,2.4188,4.8959,0.1713,3.8608,0.9925,1.5826,4.758,2.6655,3.8441,1.0819,2.3324,3.555,1.62,1.0151,7.3163,0.1714,2.1036,0.003,1.9217,3.4578,5.3083,0.0237,1.3743,5.2406,0.0151,5.6478,0.5111,5.773,0.4868,3.5314,1.2118,1.0337,3.7179,1.7271]}

The Tales of series guide book includes information on the series' various entry as well as its various spin offs, and its contents come off as something of a \"bible\" of the Tales series that also includes images of characters, weapons, enemies, and more.\n\nAmong the various entries that are covered include all three main titles, all of which are covered in great detail regarding the series' gameplay and narrative, as well as the various spin-offs and localized releases. For example, the series' origins, as well as early versions of games where combat is only available during battles while other sections are unavailable, are addressed.\n\nThe main series guide is currently scheduled for a Japanese release this fall, with no indication that it will be included as a packaged edition of the Tales of Zestiria game for PS4, which released in Japan on March 31. The Tales series guide book could also come packaged with a special Collector's Edition or standard edition of Lost Song.\n\nAdditionally, the guide will include an illustration made for the upcoming PS3 game, Tales of Zestiria, which will be released in Japan on May 28.

{"id":3668,"ended":true,"length":419,"text":"Reviewers focus most frequently on the dynamic between Norrell and Strange, arguing that the novel is about their relationship. In her review for the Times Literary Supplement, Roz Kaveney writes that the book takes place on the \"stretch of territory where love can be said to flourish best, the boundaries of the familiar, the everyday, where time can be paused, stopped, and rewound.\" \"A good deal of Norrell's narrative deals with the difficulties of the marriage we see on the page; the trouble, it seems, is that these are problems that Norrell has himself,\" she writes. But by focusing on this, Kaveney leaves aside the crucial point about the historical nature of the book. To understand this, readers need to look below the surface of the relationship between Norrell and Strange to read not only about the difficulties of the marriage but also about the nature of Victorian marriage in general. And while the book certainly takes place in a time far removed from our own, the challenges the characters face mirror aspects of marriage\u2014especially marriage that was common in the 1800s\u2014whose nature has not changed much since that time. Marriage in Victorian England had been, or had begun to become, an institution separate from the state. In the late 18th century, as men and women began to have more control over their own lives, married couples gained independence in a number of ways. They would pay for their own lodging, for instance, although this was still not unusual in the middle classes. In addition to paying for separate lodgings, men and women gradually also began to earn their own income. Since earning money was often considered to be both disgraceful and degrading (women especially), the wife or wife's family would in effect earn the money the husband worked for and provided. As a result, Victorian couples were not only independent but also increasingly dependent upon one another financially. As Norrell and Strange found out, however, dependence on one another could entail a great deal of hardship.\n\nThis article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

{"id":1306,"ended":true,"length":407,"text":"ECU began the second quarter on Boise's 30 \u2013 yard line, and quarterback Patrick Pinkney continued the Pirates'drive with a 14 \u2013 yard rush. After three more successful plays, however, Boise recovered the ball at their 25. The momentum changed quickly into Boise control, as the Broncos razed the Pirates' defense with two straight touchdowns. The first came with 21 seconds left in the first half, when quarterback Sean Canfield found tight end Justin Brown on a 16 \u2013 yard play. Then after a Pirates'punt pinned the Broncos at the 10 \u2013 yard line to start the third, linebacker Tarek Bade led Boise on a 16 \u2013 play drive that ended in a 22 \u2013 yard field goal. The Broncos never relinquished the lead, as the defense held and the offense marched down the field to cap off the first half with a 37 \u2013 0 advantage.\n\nECU head coach Ruffin McNeill elected to make the changes to the offensive line that saw starting center Joe Palko and guard Anthony Johnson in street clothes. In their place were senior Tommie Green and junior David Moore. It was a move that ECU hoped would work to their advantage. For the final three quarters, however, it was the same story for ECU : big defensive stops and limited offense.\n\nThe Pirates'first drive went for eight plays as well, but the drive stalled on their 45 \u2013 yard line, needing a first down to set up a second. On third down, ECU quarterback Patrick Pinkney was sacked by linebacker Nick Anderson, forcing a punt. Boise added another touchdown before halftime, which sealed their 20 \u2013 0 second quarter lead.\n\nThe third quarter was the same story. Early on, ECU looked promising when Pinkney found receiver Josh Brown on a 32 \u2013 yard gain. But Pinkney also had too many negative plays to help the Pirates to a score. For instance, his fourth quarter interception on the 40 \u2013 yard line, which resulted in a Boise touchdown less than two minutes later.\n\nIn all it was a forgettable night for ECU, and the team will need to improve their play drastically next Saturday if they want to keep the season from slipping away.","token_len":446,"entropy":[5.7554,8.8922,3.073,5.1271,3.1021,4.2127,13.4828,1.2204,6.6362,9.2955,7.9369,0.2781,1.8214,2.43,5.816,6.0945,10.4615,2.0468,5.7164,1.9552,9.2494,12.9863,17.7561,2.9628,0.8769,5.0724,1.3085,2.0264,4.839,1.498,4.1706,4.8343,4.7595,5.733,2.4489,0.5812,5.7764,0.0076,1.2137,5.5677,1.8711,1.2887,3.4142,4.9102,4.0665,2.4149,2.2897,6.7156,5.2017,4.9194,6.0979,4.5065,9.7739,1.0686,2.1506,1.5579,2.8904,5.8498,4.3816,0.7643,7.0252,0.4513,2.5911,2.0685,3.1627,4.0696,2.6714,0.9558,2.3648,4.5301,2.6468,2.7831,6.7368,0.6964,0.3115,0.8344,0.1736,2.02,1.0163,0.6088,1.3938,3.5596,5.3178,8.5479,1.1957,4.4336,6.2601,0.0193,4.7122,4.9102,2.0484,1.145,6.3468,3.018,0.6716,3.3838,0.9779,5.1673,6.085,1.5981,12.069,0.942,8.2114,1.6762,12.8172,1.5653,1.0625,3.945,1.1139,3.9369,1.6224,0.4278,0.0129,4.4329,4.0222,0.2487,2.0722,3.1497,4.3234,4.8706,3.2749,3.3145,7.3998,7.5686,3.2729,1.463,2.624,0.4015,3.8781,0.4501,7.2076,4.2818,1.611,2.5379,1.3382,0.5901,5.4309,0.3235,1.209,1.5311,0.0112,0.4258,1.8917,0.9287,5.3,3.5471,0.0052,1.3061,1.2358,0.9334,2.0373,1.656,4.9012,2.4394,5.9902,3.0864,4.0272,5.7451,3.3343,0.548,0.0903,1.4356,7.6171,2.249,0.5937,2.7391,0.3063,3.8364,1.0244,4.917,0.2061,5.055,5.0163,0.2856,1.3661,0.0053,11.2864,0.0019,6.6836,0.0111,10.4287,0.7272,4.5871,1.695,8.9456,0.3153,4.2973,1.1911,5.4251,1.7385,1.1511,2.5737,0.3,3.8603,4.0128,5.59,2.6352,5.1623,4.2376,8.7318,0.9358,1.9912,3.701,5.3267,3.8628,4.8196,11.9003,0.1116,1.5207,3.8324,3.7095,1.4618,2.6626,6.1508,6.3862,5.1941,0.0907,6.5402,0.659,1.5305,5.8201,5.5668,0.5608,4.9796,0.5316,1.3,3.9682,0.3827,11.8144,0.0007,5.9291,0.2437,5.5317,2.123,2.411,0.1167,1.3017,5.3118,1.3616,4.8643,2.3359,1.0496,0.4141,3.8738,0.0019,3.0025,1.3682,2.0909,4.2933,3.1408,4.3063,5.5532,0.0009,11.1302,7.586,6.384,3.8353,1.9934,6.1703,4.8028,0.8794,0.9421,0.0004,1.9667,2.5357,1.9861,7.8297,1.7693,4.3058,2.8916,5.545,3.537,4.3495,3.9207,0.9802,1.4953,1.5078,4.0571,2.027,2.8336,4.1147,7.0851,1.2092,3.6116,0.0943,2.3238,7.8827,1.4973,4.1478,0.058,1.0785,4.7254,0.1447,0.9383,2.9448,3.25,3.6765,2.7397,0.4626,0.3416,6.0407,0.0013,3.4978,3.6244,1.2722,0.0017,2.8678,2.3539,1.7866,2.9596,4.7634,6.0394,1.1319,3.9345,2.1923,2.0472,1.1984,4.3458,6.5837,1.7273,4.109,5.3207,1.6227,0.954,5.0499,5.5802,3.0944,5.1489,0.1414,1.381,6.13,3.9535,0.6129,0.2775,0.7583,0.0002,1.7223,3.7847,1.405,1.7854,2.961,2.7284,2.0194,1.6883,7.1774,2.0494,0.3878,4.2462,0.0013,4.4597,6.5404,4.3675,6.3298,0.0054,3.8304,4.9515,4.0417,4.8434,0.8517,0.3523,4.9624,0.2083,1.4844,3.6356,0.5781,2.0654,6.3799,0.0033,4.6795,2.1277,6.8222,0.5162,6.8222,0.9249,1.5916,5.7044,1.5321,2.4392,4.6397,1.0956,5.3141,1.0334,4.5664,3.1627,0.044,4.046,4.0528,2.9,1.5446,2.8231,2.2617,7.5737,1.4283,0.7151,0.0715,3.2195,2.1845,2.7963,0.0303,0.7058,7.0272,2.5038,10.5335,0.0025,1.3575,0.5985,1.029,1.7531,1.2238,0.0002,3.0455,4.8765,7.7441,1.976,1.0155,7.7121,0.0081,2.5726,0.4036,2.2246,0.001,1.0723,2.235,2.204,2.9264,3.9766,2.7452,0.2257,2.8654,3.0713,3.5897,9.3383,3.1251,4.2084,4.6324,0.3504,0.9788,0.0302,2.793,1.8323,3.8461,5.4236,3.0272,1.3688,0.328]}

These were offered up as a memorial on the occasion of the dedication of the Memorial Hall next door in 1912 and were placed in memory of those who suffered or died and as an offering to God.\n\nSpring Garden Road Memorial Library is now one of only 14 memorial libraries in Queensland.\n\nThe Australian War Memorial in Canberra and the Brisbane General Cemetery have both contributed to the Library\u2019s memorial collection.\n\nThe Library houses a variety of resources relevant to the military, from biographical material to war time literature.\n\nIt has the largest collection of World War I memorabilia in Queensland.\n\nIn the last six months of World War I over 11,000 men enlisted in the Queensland army. Many of them lived in and visited Spring Garden Road.\n\nIn 1914 the library was relocated to the present site in a larger store belonging to Mrs Emily Lillico, a resident of Spring Garden Road.\n\nIn 1918 the Memorial Hall was opened as a result of a campaign initiated by the women of Spring Garden Road. It was a time of great hardship for Queenslanders who endured economic depression and rationing, many of whom were in military service overseas.\n\nA small branch of the Library was located in the Library in the 1940s and the collection has expanded in the years since.\n\nA bronze plaque bearing the following inscription was mounted in memory of \u201cthose who suffered or died and as an offering to God\u201d.\n\nIn recognition of the great assistance given to those soldiers who were wounded, and the great services rendered by all who volunteered for service during World War II.\n\nThis plaque is mounted on the wall in the Library to commemorate the courage and sacrifice of those who sacrificed their lives in the service of their country.","token_len":446,"entropy":[9.8419,6.1127,6.6814,8.0427,5.3194,3.6414,4.1385,1.4581,3.3894,10.1225,0.1925,1.1746,6.9181,0.0881,2.8663,8.3112,6.0114,4.9982,0.1433,7.2194,0.0021,1.8064,0.3322,4.4285,11.6047,0.2267,3.4893,0.0009,6.9693,1.5575,2.1814,0.073,4.7161,0.1022,10.3429,5.7453,2.2393,1.1787,3.5056,6.1571,0.3056,0.0193,1.5264,4.4253,0.5962,0.4131,0.0009,3.3266,2.7165,6.4057,4.2001,0.0073,6.0417,7.52,2.1247,2.3378,6.2379,0.8534,3.5437,6.9746,9.8508,1.9445,1.1417,3.7516,2.0388,7.5942,5.7053,4.5254,0.414,3.4629,3.3055,0.0281,1.0275,8.8693,17.42,8.0129,5.4002,3.7499,0.1129,1.0535,6.415,0.1813,0.4368,4.75,7.2251,1.6125,2.6203,7.4502,0.2912,6.8527,2.0911,6.1627,7.1211,2.6803,1.0881,4.5814,4.6382,1.0833,3.1797,0.1032,0.5681,5.7078,0.3683,0.2999,2.6077,3.1524,5.9027,1.6036,4.0268,6.3962,2.6998,2.1749,3.7746,0.9799,4.0201,0.068,1.8847,0.3109,5.21,5.0788,0.7484,6.8792,5.1156,2.9343,3.6713,1.0512,6.1657,1.2157,0.2878,0.0004,8.6505,0.0374,0.4292,1.0901,0.1068,2.024,3.6363,4.119,0.0452,3.8676,4.8722,1.2627,3.0836,0.3247,9.7091,1.5807,1.3089,0.0003,1.962,6.2855,3.4785,0.0571,4.0994,4.1208,3.4837,0.6175,5.3146,8.2039,3.2818,2.5279,2.5405,6.1841,0.4019,0.4081,5.534,5.5286,0.1664,0.01,4.3534,4.115,0.5084,0.5449,0.0004,1.6682,2.4237,8.6629,1.8919,3.744,0.0021,5.8342,6.7164,0.0782,0.8003,4.0002,1.3642,3.4177,6.9668,1.0624,3.651,0.991,5.4708,6.5366,4.229,0.8768,0.7407,0.0002,3.8374,2.3279,3.9439,2.3589,0.8496,0.0593,5.2227,0.0159,0.8935,3.2948,0.0061,0.886,3.1669,1.7658,0.4955,0.0002,3.1964,3.0094,4.0289,4.1081,1.6635,2.3305,5.9296,0.0004,0.3396,6.2606,4.7472,0.2932,0.3829,5.8365,8.9524,0.693,0.612,4.2459,2.4144,2.6876,4.8354,0.7726,1.2419,5.2684,1.2684,4.9061,8.0432,4.056,0.0042,0.1912,1.2718,0.2571,0.0003,2.6612,5.0148,1.6288,2.8529,1.3189,6.4142,0.2482,1.4402,5.6322,2.1822,2.245,3.5251,5.9161,7.7734,8.8293,0.0056,6.482,8.064,5.0418,5.4737,7.9081,1.3703,2.1062,4.3752,0.3213,1.4739,0.0082,0.1436,0.5713,0.3877,0.0003,2.3707,3.2877,0.909,4.3396,0.8985,0.8368,2.5168,2.2933,0.5073,7.0153,0.0058,1.568,5.5423,4.2966,0.0938,0.9743,7.4114,1.4844,2.6962,0.0035,0.1431,1.5792,3.2316,1.0675,3.5437,4.486,0.6858,2.0468,4.4893,0.7382,6.6224,1.7872,2.0192,4.9128,6.0542,4.1418,0.8957,6.5175,0.0383,2.7527,4.448,0.5881,0.4163,1.6039,4.0486,5.4017,0.2545,6.2047,0.2398,0.2439,0.0002,3.5709,4.9449,6.2065,0.38,0.1235,1.4698,1.1672,4.8475,1.0157,0.7973,3.6489,4.2341,1.6956,4.8025,0.0533,1.6468,2.5498,3.8344,2.0911,4.8354,2.9537,1.4597,2.3487,0.7396,0.1709,0.428,0.0002,3.1392,4.9341,1.3249,3.6109,0.3004,6.3881,1.14,1.6913,4.8512,1.7975,6.5338,0.0105,13.0664,5.0023,5.771,0.3074,3.859,1.061,0.0849,3.2662,0.3355,0.0888,0.2518,0.0259,0.042,2.4917,10.0458,3.7837,0.3843,0.0002,3.5487,4.1315,0.0276,0.6498,4.7446,7.7484,3.68,0.3177,2.9603,5.7262,0.9636,2.614,2.3861,2.3134,2.9087,1.4746,3.766,6.4077,2.3688,1.0365,4.7734,1.5045,4.0586,1.9851,2.2183,3.1315,2.2871,0.0006,2.3207,3.0814,0.2593,0.0001,3.721,1.1682,1.8611,5.4082,1.0004,0.6293,1.6952,2.893,0.6348,0.8846,3.7158,1.2193,1.0276,7.1296,0.8172,1.1071,0.2321,1.2484,0.3414,3.7401,0.3596,0.0211,1.1886,1.25,3.5582,0.0442,1.7736,0.3214,0.3892]}
{"id":2145,"ended":true,"length":425,"text":"Recently the Canning Dam has been subjected to considerable cracking of the upper parts of the dam and upper gallery. Investigations have shown that cracking was due to strong AAR ( alkali aggregate reactivity) between upper and lower parts of the dam. The area of highest AAR was found to be around 400mm below the water surface. The main causes of cracking are related to the deterioration of existing upper parts of the Dam and to the poor quality of the newly laid concrete. The main causes of deterioration to existing parts are: 1. Poor mixing, 2. Too much water in the concrete and 3. Water seepages due to poor joints etc. Causal mechanism related to joint deterioration were also investigated and the results showed that due to poor joint quality existing parts are leaking water and the concrete strength is decreasing. The cause to cracking near the water surface is different from that of upper gallery cracks. It can be understood by a simple experiment. By using a small hole, a small quantity of water is injected into the reservoir and after some time small pocks appear at the water surface. The pocks formed by water leakage are very different from the cracks in upper part where the concrete has dried up. The causes of pocks are: 1. Water from the upper gallery seeps down and water surface is wet. 2. Lack of the upper part concrete. 3. Lack of aggregate. The main cause of water seepage is the lack of aggregate in upper part. During the initial stage of the construction when the concrete is wet and still quite hard, aggregates could be packed well. But after the concrete starts drying, the compacted aggregate starts to fall apart, the water then seeps down the cracks between the aggregate and compacts again the loose aggregate together. It can be seen by the pocks that this mechanism plays a very significant part in the cracks formation. The presence of water is the most important cause for cracking. The water could be due to water seepage, water leakage around the upper part of the dam or could also be due to excess of water in the concrete. There could be other causes of water in the concrete but water contamination is the most fundamental cause in the formation of the cracks.","token_len":447,"entropy":[3.9098,10.172,3.9842,9.461,2.5757,0.7555,6.028,0.0221,5.0051,10.4531,3.4625,1.2994,6.2006,4.936,0.4022,0.5284,1.4996,2.4395,8.5639,10.5648,2.1796,9.8919,1.298,1.9763,0.4358,5.5266,4.1224,5.3493,0.0491,6.1878,9.1136,8.943,3.0924,13.2219,2.0864,10.5733,8.1111,0.846,1.3856,4.9376,6.2109,1.0879,0.0532,1.9809,0.2699,0.1226,0.1236,0.8235,1.7796,5.4032,1.1586,7.6909,1.8399,0.1276,2.0936,2.2882,0.8597,0.2139,3.8022,4.9779,3.3725,4.1229,0.3174,3.5783,2.0187,0.7871,1.5882,5.01,5.1609,0.2775,2.0311,1.3686,6.8127,0.0564,1.0953,7.003,0.1516,5.2259,4.9472,3.5628,0.7593,0.1314,4.17,1.7836,3.2807,1.0881,6.5118,2.5385,0.0994,0.9202,6.9094,5.2499,3.4703,1.069,1.7069,3.3854,3.0356,0.2006,4.6826,5.1634,2.7488,4.3937,2.8921,2.0413,4.3819,1.3972,5.6111,8.5604,3.6136,4.1452,0.0036,4.863,1.1942,3.0915,2.0863,0.495,2.2531,1.888,0.8013,0.003,3.7109,5.5251,1.7213,3.8547,4.285,0.0027,4.1841,7.576,6.4079,0.176,8.2354,4.5915,6.1414,6.2924,0.0287,7.2745,2.0607,5.6374,2.322,3.4847,3.286,2.2972,1.8648,2.9511,0.3236,6.4345,0.0014,2.3894,2.1164,3.6102,7.8006,1.5649,3.2271,6.1012,4.4892,2.4526,2.8301,3.3004,8.6474,1.2331,3.2898,0.3045,1.5227,4.8964,6.0253,9.0056,9.5642,0.4539,4.2209,0.2034,0.8711,5.6149,0.7516,1.2912,1.1075,5.4435,5.1596,3.754,0.8102,3.2241,3.5448,0.3811,3.9195,5.1489,4.2635,2.0011,5.4931,2.7755,6.6297,2.3602,1.1734,3.5069,4.7702,4.0169,1.6774,1.9889,3.8889,0.0341,1.4177,1.4965,1.7085,0.4794,0.4176,5.1761,1.6766,4.3384,3.0798,0.2375,6.7368,5.7574,8.1545,4.884,3.5623,0.2325,2.9096,0.1857,0.4443,1.2025,1.1687,0.2957,5.4247,1.1566,4.0847,5.6495,1.4197,4.0877,5.0144,0.2916,1.3881,5.4137,2.1737,1.1445,5.8035,5.4368,1.129,5.2462,2.2054,6.4337,0.6659,0.6874,1.2176,6.8559,0.2807,4.7161,1.1067,1.3683,2.4194,0.7691,0.1964,2.8067,4.8958,0.8728,3.2068,0.8552,7.465,2.0812,3.6099,3.5927,5.1163,7.7913,1.9845,4.9556,1.1928,0.5962,0.0012,5.2631,0.0064,4.1327,3.7947,2.7379,3.6678,2.2792,0.2829,0.0012,1.7195,0.0061,8.3511,2.0615,2.3705,2.6979,0.9312,0.2281,5.0836,0.7954,0.3677,0.1138,1.0108,1.5044,2.6401,0.0146,4.8192,2.0637,2.62,0.597,1.0934,6.0707,0.9681,5.0928,3.8665,0.5903,1.3211,4.0721,7.0407,0.8453,1.2905,1.2326,3.315,2.3132,6.5165,6.0023,4.7937,1.2416,8.5312,0.164,6.0094,1.088,8.3221,7.9812,2.3551,4.6686,1.9825,1.2999,1.1799,5.0068,4.4852,3.284,1.2064,7.7515,1.7871,1.5721,4.3017,0.4297,4.4712,0.9825,3.0933,3.6586,3.0749,6.7085,3.0963,0.2532,1.121,1.9404,4.1042,5.4163,0.3377,6.0533,0.3235,8.3907,1.5011,6.7949,5.5295,5.8748,1.9059,5.7518,1.2815,3.5129,2.9622,0.4448,1.2564,4.2113,1.9981,5.8979,1.3209,1.114,3.9022,6.4512,6.5684,0.4466,2.8932,2.7894,1.9535,0.5814,0.6414,3.3493,5.4703,0.5918,1.4169,5.4958,0.0429,3.6312,3.7675,2.9312,3.197,0.5418,1.1445,3.2335,2.6056,1.3836,1.5189,2.8938,5.0898,0.8982,7.2728,0.0161,4.1662,1.4461,0.9694,0.0495,2.9501,3.9514,2.631,7.4238,0.4599,2.9735,1.1214,1.1008,0.1374,0.1844,1.4082,6.9489,3.0275,0.216,0.6142,0.0024,6.7415,3.4021,1.1543,1.0809,0.2464,0.5071,0.6667,4.2592,3.6242,0.6901,2.0232,1.4425,1.3103,2.7455,6.4635,0.4208,0.2939,3.3858,5.8606,6.4348,1.1314,1.0926,0.8134,7.1229,0.9754,4.3395,1.1023,5.248,0.1087,1.9612,0.4519,0.2585]}
{"id":699,"ended":true,"length":386,"text":"Unlike almost all other dinosaur groups, skulls are the most commonly preserved elements of ceratopsian skeletons and many species are known only from skulls. There is a great deal of variation between and within species, and the relationship between skull shape and anatomical trait remains a puzzle. Here we test the hypothesis that the relationship between skull shape and skull height was controlled by trochanter size. Ceratopsians are known from a range of skull sizes (from the smallest (Apatosaurus) to the largest (the horned titan Triceratops), and this has been a major bone-density question for some time. Here, we re-analyze ceratopsian skulls to determine if trochanter size (i.e. the width of the base of the femur) is significant as a predictor of skull size. We applied a statistical threshold analysis on a combined sample of 69 skulls using both skeletal traits (including the width of the base of the femur) and skull shape as factors (including size and number of teeth). In our analysis we focused on skulls >1.3 m high. We found that femur width was a significant predictor of skull size in all species <1.3 m high but not in any >1.3 m species. Using phylogenetic methodologies we also found that larger the trochanter size in a ceratopsian (i.e. the more wide the base of the femur), the smaller the skull size. This indicates a trade-off between skull height (which correlates with trochanter width) and skull size (which typically varies with skull shape). The relative importance of both skeletal traits (trochanter width and skull shape) in skull size varied in different species ; this suggests that skull shape and trochanter width may have co-evolved independently for different factors in different species. Finally, we found that the relative importance of bone density (measured as the volume of the skull) was significantly different between skull shapes and trochanter widths for all Ceratopsian species. We conclude that bone density did not play a key role in skull development and that skull shape and trochanter width are important independent predictors of skull size.","token_len":448,"entropy":[7.6788,1.6975,3.2666,9.7787,4.5864,0.4806,9.3012,1.3886,3.3688,1.4599,3.704,3.6963,6.1624,2.1585,7.1482,1.4103,0.0433,0.1652,4.468,3.3574,5.4445,3.4955,2.2295,3.2598,4.4341,0.5472,3.9454,1.6961,4.6797,1.5818,1.8517,2.9701,0.2565,0.2342,1.3974,2.2444,6.5748,0.5292,2.3739,1.2327,1.7648,2.2749,6.3928,0.4349,1.7672,3.8399,0.1866,5.997,7.5033,3.8289,2.021,3.5548,0.6117,4.0214,0.6868,6.0984,1.3051,0.4951,0.0843,1.6862,4.5411,0.1554,0.4371,0.3771,0.0427,3.5608,5.511,2.8095,7.0787,0.5515,8.7222,6.1582,0.2061,5.8945,1.3837,8.6819,0.0167,0.0399,0.9286,1.9817,3.0819,3.2631,2.6495,3.2629,0.0249,3.0018,1.2449,2.9895,3.6611,3.1856,2.7511,4.3554,5.3353,11.3567,1.5071,0.8682,0.2913,0.1979,0.2799,0.0988,7.674,7.4834,0.2864,6.3837,8.6264,0.2296,0.0078,0.001,1.458,1.1905,3.6062,4.0927,0.9335,4.3804,2.295,7.8148,1.4582,6.6642,3.9686,1.358,3.7723,0.2921,0.2584,3.6242,1.6615,0.1757,6.5954,0.5866,1.2312,0.1401,8.4716,0.0073,0.0618,0.066,1.1855,2.0969,2.3568,2.1447,3.1859,0.1023,0.0147,0.306,5.0878,3.8249,0.0193,0.0007,1.5405,1.9329,4.933,0.3654,0.3384,4.7137,0.4329,0.2791,6.4809,0.0301,0.7158,2.6693,4.3889,4.9971,0.3833,1.8175,0.1124,0.8667,1.6004,0.5888,1.2157,8.3339,1.203,4.6657,5.1939,3.5244,4.2674,3.6036,6.3637,2.7839,0.2987,7.0503,2.056,4.8487,5.2671,7.9979,4.9789,1.2518,5.0787,2.5249,4.376,0.2274,0.0749,0.743,0.1793,0.0561,0.1606,0.002,0.7733,0.1267,3.2685,2.3715,3.5602,5.5146,2.5677,3.4065,4.0828,1.9514,5.2937,0.036,2.0954,0.8439,3.4465,3.0303,2.1164,3.1051,5.3844,0.1515,3.1826,7.9657,2.6404,0.882,3.1328,2.286,3.2527,3.3442,1.9344,1.4154,0.5331,6.8414,0.3307,1.2094,1.0508,2.6088,0.862,0.1656,0.1072,0.5607,1.0311,2.1061,2.217,2.4888,8.0189,1.0257,0.2491,0.3228,0.2098,0.9991,4.6248,1.0404,0.4862,3.3529,11.6355,0.5153,0.0707,0.5529,0.1183,5.4286,0.5737,5.0537,6.4551,0.072,5.4396,3.6229,2.2055,2.5969,2.4259,0.4414,6.6152,5.6145,3.9514,0.1018,0.014,1.0594,3.7308,2.3577,5.6937,0.0048,0.0414,0.0032,4.1529,2.8029,0.001,0.0005,0.0755,2.1477,4.5754,5.2702,0.3252,0.8257,0.1518,0.0294,0.1063,0.0023,1.168,0.67,2.9737,0.1614,1.5236,1.8061,1.0724,1.9046,4.0979,3.3537,7.6314,0.3983,0.0092,0.2394,2.2181,2.9045,3.7004,3.9409,5.3536,0.4055,1.6126,0.0238,0.004,4.9797,0.2888,0.075,1.6976,1.4454,2.3395,0.2299,7.1537,4.8552,1.0712,3.4896,2.1821,0.6166,2.4063,5.5924,1.3575,0.0242,4.7691,6.2496,0.2548,3.1918,6.2234,0.022,0.0045,1.7896,0.5078,1.4982,2.6633,0.0753,1.2351,3.0784,0.833,6.6988,3.4165,2.6958,0.4303,9.5406,4.1296,2.1035,0.203,3.6115,1.1619,2.1734,0.4211,0.0018,0.001,2.925,2.1961,2.055,7.3346,0.2974,0.3642,0.0096,4.0819,4.2385,1.7924,8.2845,1.9772,1.7657,0.5075,0.1928,3.3873,0.0259,1.124,1.0893,0.4214,1.7254,3.3504,0.2945,0.019,3.8853,0.2704,1.836,6.5448,0.0247,1.4736,0.6815,4.2351,0.1814,2.0106,2.4379,1.3212,1.4252,2.6973,2.3144,1.1208,4.5082,3.4287,0.9429,0.5278,0.0129,0.0149,1.3339,2.3279,4.2608,1.6856,7.1461,0.0078,0.0113,0.5307,0.7209,0.7975,2.5145,2.09,0.1142,6.0571,0.2443,4.9375,0.1444,2.8649,0.192,4.3037,0.0504,0.0327,2.0915,6.4994,1.7971,0.892,3.5884,1.0469,1.5655,0.127,0.0011,0.0006,0.1085,1.923,2.0882,4.4588,2.9998,0.0002,0.0786,0.5736,0.667,0.3838]}

{"id":2150,"ended":true,"length":403,"text":"When stars form in the present Milky Way galaxy they are composed of about 71 % hydrogen and 27 % helium, as measured by mass, with a small fraction of heavier elements. The stellar population is known to be enriched in heavier elements by a so-called \"star-forming shock \".\n\nThe current state of knowledge is that such a shock occurs in the outer cloud of hydrogen between stars (a region of ~ 50000 AU). The resulting gas is not isolated from the rest of the universe, and thus, gas loss from the gas reservoir will be driven into and outside the cloud, and this mass loss is measured indirectly as \"metallicity loss\" - from the formation of the stars (i.e. the mass loss is proportional to star-formation rate ).\n\nOne of the most exciting possibilities for future progress is that - if a certain stellar population is enriched in heavy elements by a \"star-forming shock\" - more than one such shock could occur in the same galaxy.\n\nTo study this possibility, the ALMA Observatory in Chile has begun observations of molecular gas in the dense star formation region with Very Large Array (VLA or 8-metre telescopes, operated and funded by NAI). At the same time, ALMA has recorded data showing that ALMA itself is a result of a \"star-forming shock\" of the Milky Way.\n\nDuring a press conference at ALMA's third Scientific Symposium, which was held at the European Southern Observatory in Chile on 7 July 2013, Prof. Tsubocha explained: \"The most powerful telescope in the world was created at the most remote part of the northern hemisphere of the Earth by the collaboration of seven research institutes from the world. In the middle of the night, we receive information from this telescope while moving on the moon at a speed of 15 kilometers per second to reach the end point of the telescope. This is a fantastic story about how a'star-forming shock' can be constructed of the Earth, the moon, and ALMA, which is a result of that'star-forming shock'.\"\n\n###\n\nThis research was presented July 19 at the 3rd ALMA Scientific Symposium in Antofagasta, Chile.","token_len":452,"entropy":[10.5469,4.9718,1.5103,1.1893,8.4917,7.5136,0.0025,1.7388,4.4186,1.6684,6.4837,0.1432,4.2256,6.7443,6.7339,3.5984,1.0301,4.5355,0.0364,0.2578,1.2729,4.2256,4.1217,0.6141,3.8935,5.8171,3.6841,1.6738,5.8455,1.2758,0.2181,6.5594,0.7811,1.1318,1.5108,5.677,5.0956,1.3184,5.4113,1.0443,0.7976,6.4754,0.6159,3.5623,0.1786,4.8834,3.698,7.5456,0.0659,0.0012,1.9683,4.5092,2.2114,2.7662,8.0442,10.4102,2.1716,0.0236,1.5739,5.091,3.5842,0.0465,3.9772,2.2293,1.0557,5.1898,1.7739,0.552,2.7919,2.3158,1.0287,3.9677,6.9178,0.8551,5.8037,5.3777,2.8283,4.0697,4.4004,2.7218,1.4519,5.9813,5.355,6.818,4.7077,2.0514,1.6366,5.558,3.3357,1.5104,4.0232,6.685,0.5509,0.7142,2.4795,0.0218,0.0584,2.7572,0.9553,1.8647,3.31,2.7088,6.4583,7.7952,2.3832,1.3341,4.5344,6.4716,3.0588,1.4986,7.1412,2.7501,6.3625,7.9394,0.6155,3.1917,2.2116,2.704,2.5154,5.442,0.7792,2.4406,5.155,6.4524,2.8177,4.5289,6.3125,4.7296,0.5129,2.2603,1.2801,4.3906,5.7668,0.8786,5.6378,0.1304,1.8219,2.5725,3.489,3.5727,0.0027,0.0004,0.7883,1.2932,1.7577,0.7727,4.5793,2.5781,0.0167,5.0775,2.4942,2.4574,1.6242,4.2658,0.9618,0.0004,5.2164,1.3528,0.0376,1.7283,3.6253,3.7891,1.3918,3.6789,7.6633,1.9514,2.0065,7.7813,2.6711,3.5085,5.8255,4.0629,2.3838,1.1388,3.542,0.3021,3.267,0.0654,2.7734,0.8045,3.88,0.1303,0.1804,0.0156,0.0087,0.5999,0.3775,6.7821,3.5,1.619,3.8429,2.349,1.9451,2.3584,1.7231,0.7372,2.565,0.9266,1.2553,1.9117,0.0005,4.1552,4.5195,1.1727,1.512,0.6109,1.9036,8.1838,0.6552,4.7706,2.1657,1.8745,1.9455,4.2397,6.5113,0.4699,8.0427,2.4159,2.0612,0.6181,5.0383,3.3816,4.1263,2.239,5.7379,9.3558,0.4299,2.0824,0.6215,0.5092,1.5049,8.2284,8.4077,1.4737,4.0762,0.1113,4.9557,3.206,6.297,6.3529,2.0549,0.0598,10.9507,3.0614,1.3866,5.0237,1.0506,1.4943,0.0223,0.2613,2.6001,0.0109,0.9987,5.5449,3.9237,3.6187,0.6926,7.0045,0.0096,6.0412,1.097,2.2831,7.3097,0.0119,1.4869,2.3751,0.7625,0.2049,0.0751,0.1031,0.815,3.2153,1.8446,5.0848,0.0006,1.9223,0.7807,0.0003,5.7756,2.9677,5.9913,0.2307,1.8854,3.5962,0.0064,1.1672,8.5462,6.6623,3.0451,0.0022,1.8666,4.3721,1.3313,0.3768,1.6865,0.4057,4.1236,2.7043,0.0027,1.185,4.4025,1.5059,3.9709,3.0142,2.6525,0.1802,4.5324,0.6821,5.2932,6.1816,8.3699,1.607,5.8517,2.76,1.2451,1.6331,4.479,4.3359,4.691,0.9483,0.3416,0.1342,4.0611,3.579,3.1624,0.616,7.0242,4.5997,2.9489,0.0033,0.1475,6.9834,0.6272,2.7374,0.3808,3.8377,2.6638,1.1155,5.1274,0.1726,5.9372,6.1729,1.6283,0.0022,2.9392,1.6708,4.9938,3.724,3.2849,1.5759,5.5732,0.1492,0.5639,1.8642,1.0364,2.0342,7.9638,4.5407,0.7328,4.3639,1.5995,6.3721,5.8268,3.4423,1.3885,3.5358,3.9372,1.8486,2.2776,0.2538,4.7677,3.0599,0.099,0.1595,5.3255,4.2191,0.8816,5.129,3.7425,0.861,0.3768,2.8461,0.8568,2.2488,1.4887,2.1921,5.9114,7.227,4.0779,2.1059,2.6619,11.8634,14.6447,3.468,3.3183,0.6186,10.0031,2.6402,1.2836,7.2091,4.7499,2.3561,7.0042,3.0098,2.1979,1.9681,0.842,0.8762,7.8088,0.007,3.3097,2.2863,1.6044,2.4954,4.1581,0.0199,5.7923,7.1061,0.089,0.6351,0.089,0.0728,8.0183,0.1848,0.0002,5.4303,0.2352,0.0003,2.7425,1.6826,0.3481,5.8184,8.232,3.5896,2.2097,0.2287,4.4435,0.0989,3.7757,0.0189,0.7205,0.025,0.0015,1.4345,6.0793,6.2331,0.4231,0.1241,0.2439,0.4837,0.6208]}
{"id":1270,"ended":true,"length":390,"text":"USS Ericsson ( Destroyer No. 56 \/ DD @ - @ 56 ) was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding of Camden, New Jersey, in November 1913 and launched in August 1916. Ericsson received her nickname from her resemblance to a sailboat named ericsson, the name of the company that built her sister ships. Ericsson was commissioned by the Navy in October 1916 and served until being stricken from the Naval Register in April 1918.\n\nEricsson was a three-masted schooner-rigged, iron-hulled, steel-hulled, steam- and diesel-powered, destroyer. She was classified as a 'Danish' type'scout destroyer'. She was built with the capability of converting to a gunboat.\n\nDuring the early 1920s, Ericsson operated off the Caribbean coast as a training ship at Hampton Roads, Virginia, before being recommissioned in 1930. She patrolled off the Pacific Northwest coast in the 1930s and participated in joint activities with the US Coast Guard. She was briefly decommissioned beginning in November 1941 and then recommissioned in January 1942 to escort convoys, primarily in the West Indies and along the east coast of the United States.\n\nReturning to Hampton Roads in early 1944, Ericsson was redesignated a Destroyer Squadron headquarters in April 1944. She was decommissioned again in July 1944. Ericsson was stricken from the Naval Register on 9 June 1945 and broken up for scrap in 1947.\n\nThe US Navy, in conjunction with the US Department of the Interior, designated this ship as a Registered Ship on 21 March 1946. When the US Congress passed the National Sea Grant College Program Act on 20 September 1960, it was necessary to add \"Sea\" to the existing name of this ship. On 15 August 1962, the name was officially changed to \"USS Sea Grant College Program \".\n\nNotes\n\nDisclaimer : These articles are compiled and presented for historical interest and educational purposes only.

{"id":2928,"ended":true,"length":379,"text":"According to Mendelian inheritance, variations in an organism's phenotype ( observable physical and behavioral characteristics ) are due in part to variations in its genotype ( particular set of genes ). Each different genotype is called a \" gene \".Inheritance is based on \" homologous recombination \", where, unlike in genetic recombination, genes in each cell ( the \" genome \") \" copy \" any genes they contain in their \" neighbors \" across the cell's genome.\n\nThe basic Mendelian inheritance model posits that phenotypic variation can be defined into different classes, e g by genotype and phenotype type. That means that there are only two classes of organisms: alleles of genes that form proteins with the same or very similar properties and alleles of proteins that have different properties. This simplifies the description of organisms in terms of their phenotypes : \"genotype\" is the whole set of alleles that have a given phenotype and is in many cases the same as \"phenotype type \". For example both a red blood cell and a white blood cell can be derived from an identical cell that has two red blood cells.In the case or allelic phenotypic inheritance, however, there are three types ( e ect type classes).\n\nPhenotypic inheritance can be described in terms of \" homologous recombination \" or \" heterologous recombination \", depending on how it is related to the genes.In general, phenotypic inheritance of alleles depends mostly on genes that are located on the same chromosome but also on genes on other chromosomes. For example, alleles that code for hemoglobin on the X chromosome ( a variant allele ) may be more common than other alleles of hemoglobin B. Phenotypic inheritance by heterologous recombination ( alleles on different chromosomes ) can also be useful, as it allows different alleles to complement each other.\n\nFruiting bodies of diploid Arabidopsis thaliana with multiple copies of the SLC22A4 gene, which is thought to mediate homologous recombination to drive the development of many different phenotypes.\n\nIn the next lecture we will learn more about the genetic mechanism involved in development.","token_len":453,"entropy":[1.9909,9.895,1.8126,3.9442,11.1092,1.133,10.3932,0.1878,5.6663,2.7569,0.209,5.1036,4.0164,15.2474,7.245,3.6655,2.3206,1.1331,1.6501,1.4785,4.0077,4.2477,0.1735,0.0103,4.1255,0.0391,1.9427,6.0575,0.0976,2.253,10.1197,6.8104,0.0815,1.1719,2.0426,6.0528,6.5335,4.1245,0.0139,1.754,4.9893,0.5278,1.9163,7.3253,3.737,9.3527,7.0938,0.3772,1.3554,3.6254,0.0863,6.2126,7.6118,2.7477,0.3317,3.082,0.0554,1.5047,2.3943,5.2561,6.3127,1.633,4.6788,4.5758,0.0567,0.6448,5.1121,4.3932,3.3967,3.4444,3.687,4.7127,2.3754,4.2884,0.3805,3.7746,5.5712,4.7291,4.6453,6.1201,3.8135,2.4411,3.4867,2.5235,1.4117,3.6574,6.5935,1.4416,7.9221,1.2353,2.0314,2.5148,2.4229,1.4066,3.8163,0.0007,2.4466,5.0575,9.9765,0.0019,0.0015,2.7075,2.2629,5.6545,0.0207,0.2735,5.2971,0.7733,0.0641,1.2735,3.4996,0.4836,4.956,7.3712,3.9222,3.4187,2.0586,4.3922,14.2299,6.2079,6.7568,1.118,2.245,2.5358,6.591,0.9746,5.7116,4.0166,0.5857,3.4063,0.7122,4.191,1.6471,1.0555,0.2681,5.0875,1.2187,5.7666,0.0952,2.8015,3.4662,1.7518,5.1043,7.4414,3.9994,2.1468,0.5318,4.5398,5.0175,0.1504,2.316,2.3821,0.8516,0.0013,0.2888,3.8117,0.5503,3.9545,1.6497,0.3463,0.9909,3.234,6.3541,0.0919,0.5187,4.9507,0.0825,6.3914,3.0222,2.451,0.0081,1.9773,1.8154,1.1513,6.8082,3.744,3.4476,1.9606,1.319,1.1038,1.496,6.4184,2.538,0.0388,2.8295,0.0033,1.7957,3.6306,2.3141,3.0371,1.4302,1.6866,4.756,5.1677,4.8882,1.1276,2.4585,1.7236,1.3174,2.0416,2.5813,0.2217,2.8737,4.109,3.0591,0.2938,10.0523,4.6737,4.6166,3.0161,0.0173,0.5622,0.4298,2.3138,0.0996,0.0161,3.3941,1.4423,5.805,0.3276,3.5865,2.816,4.2223,3.8455,1.0248,3.6022,4.6555,0.1332,0.1372,1.6561,5.5481,1.7153,2.5588,11.1757,5.2044,3.2745,5.8061,1.7719,0.0751,5.0377,1.024,5.2235,0.0236,1.5878,0.5089,3.4441,2.8542,4.354,4.2864,8.928,7.7737,7.1525,4.1864,3.6833,0.0002,5.5326,0.172,0.3214,0.0394,0.1588,3.1895,0.4976,3.6915,1.6228,1.3928,0.003,3.2429,5.3999,0.3865,0.027,0.0406,0.0034,2.7363,2.4014,0.3807,3.0683,1.4722,0.0177,0.3531,0.0287,2.5477,5.1529,0.0779,2.9142,2.99,0.3279,4.8574,0.0972,1.3608,4.2659,2.7611,6.0012,4.5704,0.1258,2.9282,0.1177,0.0207,0.1375,3.3951,3.6445,0.011,3.9737,6.1892,0.0628,5.72,1.2353,0.9762,5.1782,1.9622,1.3097,1.8784,0.6498,4.3039,4.092,0.4111,2.9207,4.864,3.2884,0.1267,0.6423,2.042,0.0964,0.2768,3.4251,0.0343,2.3042,9.565,0.1028,6.3953,0.0664,5.631,1.3686,4.1573,0.0566,2.8292,5.204,5.6143,5.3242,1.8703,3.0301,0.9594,4.948,1.5909,1.1913,4.719,0.39,0.0017,2.746,1.3614,0.0019,9.9146,2.6753,6.6892,0.0874,0.0398,0.0381,5.667,4.5815,0.1052,0.0149,0.0176,0.0042,3.2809,5.3304,0.2865,3.0559,2.9989,0.223,0.7285,1.8652,1.2838,0.3464,7.0187,3.7362,2.1438,1.841,1.5479,4.5689,2.1832,0.0032,0.5662,6.7794,0.9224,0.0103,1.3583,0.9757,0.0002,5.9661,7.7704,1.3261,8.6553,2.3332,10.1393,0.3598,0.0441,9.341,0.0341,0.0041,1.651,0.0014,0.0017,4.1997,6.6643,3.9147,0.2274,1.3677,6.5136,3.5388,4.868,2.7632,3.8452,0.8892,2.6616,1.9292,1.3627,4.8953,0.008,4.5137,0.0006,6.0151,0.3074,0.0645,0.0747,0.0066,6.3915,6.643,1.7797,3.0847,0.0202,4.8045,2.1023,2.0949,0.1268,1.4206,1.216,0.0002,3.0099,1.934,4.3557,6.9413,1.447,0.2572,3.5518,2.3278,0.0166,0.9655,3.1782,4.2114,3.9586,0.029,5.9537,3.1261]}

{"id":4811,"ended":true,"length":405,"text":"During World War II in Yugoslavia, the United States initially supported the royal government of Yugoslavia. When the Nazis invaded Yugoslavia in the spring of 1941, the United States decisively supported the partisan movement which became the main anti-Nazi uprising in Europe. The United States also aided the Greek Resistance, notably the Greek Communist Army, throughout the whole of the Second World War.\n\nAfter the war, the United States attempted diplomatic engagement with Yugoslav leader Marshal Josip Broz Tito, with American leaders including Harry S Truman urging Tito, in 1945, to \"stay out of Europe's business\" because the U.S. was worried about \"the security and freedom of the German people.\" However, due to the strong influence of the Soviets, the Truman administration chose not to pursue more cordial relations with Tito, and the United States withdrew from his country in 1950 after a failed coup against Tito by a group of soldiers led by General Ante Markovi\u0107 in which Markovi\u0107 was killed.\n\nDespite U.S. opposition, the Yugoslav Communists organized their resistance against the Soviet puppet state known as \"Yugoslavia\" from 1949 to 1950 or 1951 onwards. The Yugoslav Communists did not participate directly in the anti-Communist struggles of Eastern Europe and the rest of the Non-Aligned Movement, but did attempt to undermine them in a more indirect manner. When East Germany was created in August 1949, President Truman refused to recognize Jenseitsdeutsches Reich (the German Democratic Republic) as the successor state of West Germany. During the Cold War, the Cold War with the Soviet Union had a huge influence both on the U.S. and on the United Kingdom. The Cold War in the Balkans was also influenced by the Cold War, and the British government supported the Greek Resistance against the Communist invasion in the summer of 1944, with some British members of the House of Commons as well as the Labour prime minister Clement Attlee, calling for more decisive U.S. assistance to the resistance movement.\n\nThis page is based on a Wikipedia article written by authors\n(here).\nText is available under the CC BY-SA 3.0 license; additional terms may apply.\nImages, videos and audio are available under their respective licenses.","token_len":458,"entropy":[7.8996,0.0468,0.2951,5.4116,6.8916,0.3489,1.9022,3.681,0.0953,6.9348,3.1015,0.9184,10.9862,4.5518,0.6849,1.9019,1.6454,4.4215,0.9077,3.9229,0.542,1.7552,0.53,4.4177,1.834,0.0194,1.1396,0.1232,0.8477,0.6693,0.007,8.5076,2.3626,0.4739,11.7317,4.8063,4.1925,5.4422,0.9022,3.5599,4.8622,0.0326,1.6944,6.739,0.766,2.2783,0.3474,1.6789,1.1992,0.017,2.6053,5.8855,0.6739,7.4232,7.2943,2.4056,7.8688,1.8345,3.4153,2.2339,5.7602,1.149,7.5389,0.5201,6.0118,0.7594,1.1021,2.5973,0.0143,0.0005,0.3779,1.314,0.0063,3.2878,0.9714,1.4437,0.308,0.6631,0.3579,0.0059,5.4448,8.8485,5.1459,0.2161,5.4478,4.9799,9.1804,2.8704,0.0151,0.609,0.1678,0.01,0.0006,1.6617,4.6872,6.8257,5.5066,1.8491,5.3375,1.9793,2.903,7.3261,5.8911,0.0005,5.4623,2.6307,4.5736,0.1798,0.0481,3.375,5.9436,1.2747,0.1218,5.2361,3.6828,6.7019,2.4622,3.7296,2.5365,4.1776,0.0006,0.0035,0.0585,1.3681,5.1771,0.5927,3.2147,1.6637,5.5653,2.9006,5.4738,0.168,1.1283,4.5222,0.3004,0.664,2.6371,0.0307,5.0296,0.0054,1.0408,5.2901,4.2535,0.1684,0.892,4.6816,1.1414,0.793,7.6487,0.3529,4.8262,1.7424,0.0025,3.2139,6.1219,9.0832,0.004,0.3012,0.0738,4.2691,0.0006,1.8651,1.7137,2.0103,1.6844,0.0069,4.1718,0.8566,4.5298,3.0551,1.1352,4.2801,3.9518,2.3882,4.4826,2.4173,3.4063,0.5614,0.0005,3.3602,3.4744,3.3129,0.0432,6.7434,2.6336,0.0113,2.1857,8.4315,2.6738,10.254,5.0841,0.0386,3.0286,3.5012,6.4885,0.1243,0.0005,1.2659,2.3784,0.2717,0.8077,0.0002,4.2224,4.2917,0.0014,0.0016,0.0939,4.9932,0.7857,0.8158,3.014,5.2881,5.6767,3.0245,6.2031,1.8452,0.7167,2.3916,8.1593,3.7581,6.8275,0.0195,3.2856,4.7292,0.0944,0.0004,0.261,1.2481,4.8334,2.8878,0.8329,3.0553,7.8986,3.1461,6.4933,0.4575,1.4811,2.4238,1.135,4.4467,0.2374,4.6443,3.9989,0.1077,0.3952,3.7544,0.0034,2.9055,0.0347,4.1619,1.022,6.6946,0.0669,2.5815,2.2351,4.4852,0.0127,0.3735,10.0278,0.1704,3.8145,0.0136,0.0161,1.3764,0.8487,3.3773,4.3022,0.2143,5.8529,4.6084,2.4126,2.7993,4.9725,3.5755,1.3528,0.7357,4.9363,7.5564,0.7246,2.5577,6.0519,0.8089,5.4028,2.1965,0.4074,6.7957,1.3316,5.0186,0.1915,1.9631,9.046,11.8125,8.6632,10.0206,7.7574,0.0689,1.9817,6.2325,2.4139,1.8842,2.7376,4.3636,0.4754,0.7495,0.6979,1.5372,3.6913,0.8079,0.7687,5.711,0.0454,1.0738,4.5267,0.6996,2.6757,0.0007,0.2296,0.8173,5.644,0.0087,4.8365,0.7593,0.4914,0.0028,3.7725,2.0447,4.114,2.1903,6.499,0.7734,0.7634,2.6849,0.0004,0.0011,0.1632,0.8702,0.6417,0.8118,4.7583,1.9934,0.9125,2.2256,2.1842,0.0027,4.4886,1.0277,3.2908,2.0422,1.9952,2.9895,0.1238,0.6529,1.4988,0.0064,4.1365,2.0313,1.2299,4.0742,2.7625,3.7159,0.66,7.0855,1.0038,3.4949,0.6986,3.7939,4.3207,2.1135,1.4662,3.7253,0.0198,2.8626,2.2231,3.1097,4.6116,1.6316,3.5833,0.5597,0.243,4.3209,0.0477,0.4868,5.8078,1.2343,0.1876,1.5501,4.3858,7.6962,0.0306,6.5715,0.0025,0.0,2.678,4.7151,0.5382,5.629,7.4945,5.0135,0.0014,0.2515,0.1416,5.4083,1.8446,0.9257,3.5462,3.341,0.545,0.7093,0.0002,5.2657,5.7264,1.5642,3.4444,0.1276,1.8212,5.6113,0.4581,4.5914,0.2919,9.3429,6.0211,13.1454,7.1891,5.7761,0.9064,23.073,3.9171,3.7518,3.2545,1.1183,4.2684,0.6518,0.4783,0.7046,0.5427,0.0014,0.0058,0.4213,5.5707,6.2881,2.536,2.0407,2.7358,0.5318,0.8983,20.8215,3.9963,2.4514,0.9989,3.0938,1.3467,1.2339,1.2786,6.984,1.0313,1.3259,0.7025]}
{"id":1111,"ended":false,"length":397,"text":"Cresswell was born in Bridlington, East Riding of Yorkshire to George and Denise ( n\u00e9e < unk > ). He started playing for Bridlington Rangers at the age of eight before joining the youth academy at Hull City, where he quickly progressed through the ranks winning three successive promotion's, including being promoted to the first team while still at school. He also had a brief loan spell at non league side North Ferriby United before returning to Hull City. He was given his first team debut by Nigel Pearson against Stoke City in September, 2004, scoring his first senior goal in a 1-1 draw against Carlisle United. In his first full season he finished as the only Hull City player to feature in all of the clubs 25 games but the club only managed to finish 9th. In his second season he captained the club for the first time to their highest ever league position of third. As the season progressed he established himself in the first team due to the defensive injuries that Hull were experiencing. He finished as the clubs joint top scorer with 14 goals that season and was rewarded with his first ever England u20 selection.\n\nCresswell was given a work permit at the beginning of the season which allowed him to work for Arsenal as their academy coach. His work permit expired at the end of the season whereupon Cresswell returned to Hull City in January. However Cresswell still had 2 months remaining on his contract at Arsenal. Due to this there was a huge public outcry as the player was offered a permanent position at Arsenal rather than a permanent position at Hull City. Ultimately the club said that Cresswell could stay on at Arsenal but that he couldn't work for a rival. Cresswell returned to Hull City in early June, and the club were expected to offer him a new deal.

{"id":4607,"ended":true,"length":408,"text":"On 31 July 1942, Blamey informed Rowell that I Corps headquarters would be sent to Port Moresby to control operations in New Guinea. Rowell arrived in Port Moresby on 13 August 1942 and flew back to Perth the next day. On 23 November he reported that I Corps would be based in Brisbane, Queensland, from 1 December 1942, as an independent corps-level command. He was promoted major general on 28 June 1943 and on 5 December of the same year was given command of the 8th Division at Canberra.\n\nDuring December 1943, the 8th Division was involved in the defence of the Brisbane\u2013Melbourne railway line. On 3 March 1944, the division was put on partial occupation duty in the south-eastern part of the Kokoda Track where it was initially stationed at Rabaul as part of Task Force 47. In April 1944, it returned to Australia to take over the defensive duties of the Kokoda Track from the Australian 2nd Division. On 7 August 1944, 8th Division was moved from Rabaul in New Guinea to support the Australian 7th Division, which was trying to capture Lae and other towns in the Kokoda Track. As part of a broader Australian counterattack, 8th and 17th Brigades moved up on 7 August 1944 from Manus. Over the next 48 hours, the two brigades captured numerous points in the Kokoda Track and were advancing on their main target of Lae. The final assault on Lae began on 16 August 1944 as the Kokoda Track campaign came to a close.\n\nIn September 1944, I Corps headquarters was moved to Brisbane as part of moves to create a corps-level command in Queensland. Rowell became the General Officer Commanding 1st Brigade in early 1945, and the following year was appointed to take over command of the newly created Australian Army headquarters for the island of New Guinea. Rowell was to act as the Australian staff officer to the Commander-in-Chief Australian forces. Rowell stayed in the new post less than eight months before departing for the United States in April 1947. He returned to Australia in March 1949. Rowell's wife died in 1949, and he married a second time in January 1954. Rowell died on 21 December 1969 in South Melbourne, aged 75.","token_len":462,"entropy":[9.1257,2.8646,6.0436,0.3054,9.146,6.5682,4.2473,7.9469,10.305,3.6804,0.6366,6.6239,13.0513,6.8192,3.3058,0.8564,4.9279,0.4779,7.3324,4.256,0.0637,0.0001,1.5814,7.1209,5.2579,1.8034,4.9605,1.2656,0.6393,2.9631,0.0027,5.8944,1.6107,1.1697,0.0177,0.0003,0.0001,0.79,4.2109,1.2246,1.4834,1.326,5.8787,3.3814,0.3857,7.5758,4.4762,1.0153,0.1274,0.6065,2.4442,3.6304,4.241,3.2555,4.4915,1.387,2.7703,0.0688,4.8552,0.767,6.6474,0.8744,4.2235,1.3306,2.2056,1.1878,5.3325,2.8239,1.6871,0.6365,2.9256,5.0089,3.8455,5.6371,6.3232,6.7533,4.7731,3.0166,1.1466,2.2384,2.3168,5.9749,12.3147,2.6272,2.0313,3.1706,3.5466,0.5092,1.129,2.9625,3.0043,2.2314,6.3106,2.7045,0.1261,0.0312,2.0287,3.8343,1.0584,0.2333,0.9183,5.2262,0.2991,2.6269,3.3006,4.9575,0.5,2.1578,0.015,3.9932,5.8493,1.324,0.6244,2.9568,4.8279,0.006,0.1466,1.1419,5.2117,0.0487,1.7788,5.913,0.0537,1.8276,5.6344,7.9584,4.1367,0.1754,3.6684,0.932,1.1886,2.2446,3.2261,2.9622,0.5487,0.4919,1.6272,3.8109,1.0184,5.9553,1.7749,9.2178,6.2569,2.8116,1.3248,1.584,3.8774,1.2046,2.5802,0.0016,1.5398,0.0019,0.8258,8.8703,4.5485,10.0845,4.6,0.6233,1.0617,6.1995,3.5863,3.192,8.3046,1.3618,6.0487,1.33,0.0008,6.7527,0.3956,6.7022,0.6926,2.9728,2.5245,1.0963,0.448,2.7821,3.9528,0.1111,3.0381,1.5971,3.2229,3.7668,1.5644,6.6896,1.9708,0.9126,0.7437,5.6479,0.0139,1.906,3.9852,1.3739,2.3253,6.9396,0.2117,1.8375,0.4976,1.6642,2.8191,2.9734,0.4297,0.2297,6.029,0.0152,0.0396,1.1134,3.5202,2.0956,2.6262,0.0005,4.6049,4.0736,0.1541,0.2257,6.643,1.1222,2.87,4.7357,0.0066,0.1017,3.0228,1.6937,0.8808,6.7773,0.0452,3.6871,4.7533,7.8609,3.4494,4.0153,3.3875,1.1542,1.007,2.9503,0.0148,0.7902,0.4982,4.7079,1.1245,0.0005,3.7976,5.7956,4.6981,4.0605,2.7277,1.0108,2.0187,0.0038,6.5392,5.2225,0.0173,6.5357,0.0128,3.2392,4.2925,3.8755,4.9152,1.178,2.1572,1.8626,6.8229,1.9997,5.1057,6.1297,0.4128,0.3089,4.7185,0.0377,0.4442,1.223,5.1431,2.5209,0.0039,5.9431,5.4013,5.0567,1.2889,0.6552,0.1283,0.0141,0.2926,1.3968,3.043,5.7923,1.1909,5.6654,2.9637,2.0277,1.9137,1.7166,0.1112,0.837,1.9806,5.7657,2.6059,1.4042,0.7144,0.0024,2.6772,0.3614,3.6811,0.6327,1.0283,4.9401,1.1634,2.7154,0.0616,1.5695,7.8099,5.5992,0.1043,1.2047,0.4903,0.3134,1.2858,0.0002,2.387,4.05,0.5509,0.1695,4.0008,0.0775,3.8057,1.7863,2.1782,0.5507,1.4575,4.1392,0.4717,0.0007,11.2548,0.6072,5.3614,0.7205,5.2196,0.9336,0.0552,0.1957,1.8919,2.6667,0.4414,6.1966,0.0072,5.2248,2.2748,6.7615,2.9888,4.902,0.6876,5.1338,0.2657,2.3103,1.8801,3.9492,3.2041,1.4814,1.426,3.028,5.1807,1.0833,2.0356,3.0259,2.5648,4.6794,0.4545,2.4959,0.2112,0.6551,7.0357,1.9583,3.7625,4.1105,6.8465,5.7469,1.0889,7.5232,1.0564,2.6938,0.4817,0.2377,3.1021,0.0028,1.4481,3.8826,4.8838,0.1416,1.73,4.3106,7.012,1.852,3.8774,1.6294,5.9104,1.0473,0.0282,0.0054,0.012,9.7013,4.7831,2.0564,3.0739,0.0029,5.9767,1.1486,3.7565,5.0561,4.6643,10.0193,0.0056,5.2868,0.2894,2.6847,4.6931,1.1201,2.2741,2.7861,0.1176,2.242,3.539,3.278,0.3815,2.3055,1.9563,0.2786,0.5804,1.3742,3.1024,1.5796,1.8469,3.3787,0.0028,2.4997,4.4056,3.8639,0.808,3.3475,1.5747,0.9142,1.7063,4.2254,2.1541,3.3285,2.1297,0.8085,4.0229,4.3963,0.3915,2.816,0.0038,2.1866,1.2489,3.663,2.5992,5.3653,1.9574,5.3407,3.7173,0.6373,6.0685,3.7378,0.1357]}
{"id":2361,"ended":false,"length":409,"text":"Along with Annie Smith Peck, Workman was recognized during the early 20th century as one of the most famous female climbers in the world. Their rivalry demonstrated that women could climb the most difficult rock routes on the planet successfully.\n\nIn 1905 Annie Workman and Annie Smith Peck led a four-member, all-women climbing team up Mount Evans, Colorado, the world's first eight-thousand foot (2,438 m) peak. The expedition started with difficulty: the women had difficulties hauling their packs, which were heavy with everything they needed.\n\nAt one point, Workman and Peck started fighting, and Workman broke Peck's nose. From this encounter, Workman had said, \"We got home the other day, and I was glad... She looked like she was just as rough as a horse; I just think she needs a woman to guide her around here.\" Peck died in 1912 due to complications from a broken hip that was treated in the hospital by Dr. Leland Gage, who later served as a surgeon in World War I. Workman continued to climb, soloing El Capitan in 1914 and developing a method for fixing ropes on the face.\n\nIn 1911, she and another climber, her sister-in-law Grace Palmer, were the first women to climb Colorado's Great Sand Dunes. During the 1920s, she climbed El Capitan again at least 25 times. She completed El Capitan's Nose on her first try in 1923 after a few hundred pitches of practice pitches, but fell and broke her leg in the process. Workman was the first to complete both free-hand and clipped-solo the Nose, the first to complete the Nose and Free-Solo the Dawn Wall, and the first woman to complete the Dawn Wall (though another first climber, Ann Updegraff, had done it a year earlier).\n\nWorkman published about her accomplishments and wrote, 'Woman is the keystone of progress on earth... the race goes on until you have a woman on every peak, and the world is truly leveled.\" She also once said, \"Climbing in the mountains makes one feel as though one is alive, at one with the world, and not a piece of useless machinery!\"","token_len":462,"entropy":[3.6151,10.8685,6.9047,12.7489,0.8929,11.1339,0.8558,2.5459,6.3531,5.9707,0.6647,5.6793,3.5059,0.0076,0.1182,0.9308,1.4162,0.0093,0.2712,1.5397,4.6116,4.4563,8.205,1.2103,0.5696,0.464,0.3324,6.7365,7.934,9.5458,1.6545,2.1305,2.2543,2.633,2.5437,3.5385,1.6782,3.4787,5.6264,2.7888,0.8564,0.2281,9.0769,0.9452,1.4048,0.0019,2.682,5.3899,4.1283,6.4992,0.0017,2.7061,2.5532,0.7586,0.0694,5.5231,1.0683,5.1269,0.2803,6.4686,4.0407,4.3473,0.4527,2.8166,3.3669,0.3835,5.1148,1.7159,6.8198,1.682,3.8015,1.359,4.0532,2.8784,0.0283,2.7766,9.0577,0.1228,7.1225,0.0692,2.2735,3.8555,2.685,0.1063,7.2002,1.1852,0.0289,2.5155,0.3301,2.0142,4.439,4.4318,1.4824,8.9122,4.5911,2.4168,4.4314,1.6879,9.4161,8.7969,0.0716,2.4789,5.254,1.637,3.5469,2.0154,3.5062,3.5826,7.6162,2.1953,3.2874,2.128,2.3637,0.0002,4.4702,3.6103,0.1489,1.5659,2.9461,0.005,1.6383,0.0513,4.1984,5.9274,2.5641,1.3561,2.7073,0.0042,3.9505,6.4551,0.2142,3.6924,1.2374,6.719,2.3072,6.8218,0.5929,1.7788,0.0015,3.8777,6.3853,1.02,0.539,3.4526,5.1378,6.3342,4.8544,2.7197,0.173,1.6243,0.7534,1.9616,2.283,5.37,8.2066,6.0892,4.6811,2.4555,1.7934,0.8738,4.7932,4.8581,7.0123,0.3995,3.7033,3.7916,4.5307,2.04,4.2355,4.5565,0.7474,6.052,1.5106,7.606,1.4752,4.3186,0.1312,4.4298,5.3595,0.6897,5.2375,5.0564,1.063,3.5896,6.9986,0.0078,1.5956,0.6568,2.2196,2.6506,5.8648,4.6706,2.6847,5.1304,2.0877,1.3638,1.2425,3.5139,3.6875,0.0813,4.9269,3.2736,4.6937,4.0231,1.7581,1.5479,2.5958,4.7281,0.198,1.7275,2.6104,1.613,6.3543,0.0113,0.6423,0.1509,3.0931,0.0013,3.9565,1.0186,0.7892,2.0381,9.6313,0.4975,9.3276,1.1875,0.0706,2.0343,4.0305,1.0964,8.4403,1.6544,6.4656,1.6136,6.2267,4.0035,2.1319,1.3784,5.6228,2.5585,0.6525,0.0002,2.1606,4.1913,0.8357,4.309,2.8028,6.4513,4.4802,0.0,0.557,6.8284,2.597,3.0186,0.0114,0.0019,0.0034,7.8274,7.1021,0.2859,2.1374,4.0678,0.1887,1.1598,0.3064,1.275,7.9048,0.4014,4.4226,6.3459,3.5974,0.0577,0.8088,4.7203,0.8474,4.2659,0.1522,0.6949,2.7107,2.455,3.664,0.1954,0.0435,4.372,4.5272,4.4717,5.4394,0.0644,1.4721,2.5814,5.0844,3.8776,0.023,0.0725,3.2079,7.4648,2.9259,3.5296,1.5325,5.5921,1.2413,3.4553,5.0316,1.9648,3.9121,5.442,4.279,3.0476,6.8111,7.679,2.3735,1.6999,5.3584,4.2514,2.3837,0.0998,4.425,1.3854,2.0232,2.1119,0.0857,2.1084,0.0031,2.059,3.7836,0.4445,2.1132,4.911,4.9473,9.0312,2.1357,4.5945,0.9805,9.7612,2.386,5.7109,1.948,6.1458,2.523,2.146,3.6624,1.4065,1.88,2.3607,2.32,1.0775,3.0363,6.2395,1.8147,4.4403,0.0584,1.8292,10.0015,4.3425,1.7488,0.4791,0.6336,0.1239,2.0046,0.1671,1.6579,0.8724,3.5259,0.0352,4.6778,5.2729,7.035,5.0164,4.4908,0.0,0.496,6.5192,9.5846,2.4094,2.2907,2.1823,0.2123,2.9896,3.2719,2.0991,4.2746,2.2678,0.3158,0.6177,0.5484,0.0002,2.0083,0.0082,7.1211,6.1531,3.2936,4.1202,2.9649,4.0568,4.3621,5.05,7.0411,2.6923,1.8898,4.8524,3.7803,0.7958,5.783,4.4436,3.2718,3.4856,3.9236,7.5728,5.2538,0.4317,3.7442,3.9766,2.3778,2.2317,1.5291,3.1223,5.3755,3.6309,2.0792,1.4089,3.0243,4.1421,1.8764,7.4423,8.9772,6.4548,3.3456,2.3433,6.3188,1.7018,0.6563,0.2458,6.2134,0.0527,0.3816,4.0808,1.0898,2.9867,4.7267,3.8213,1.9571,2.94,1.4919,1.9691,0.8902,4.4842,1.6614,4.8141,3.4075,1.9077,0.7557,1.9325,1.5053,0.9736,4.3191,3.4111,3.5931,0.2737,7.7715,4.4271,6.1383]}
{"id":1460,"ended":true,"length":419,"text":"In deposit, the spores appear brown. Viewing them with a light microscope reveals finer details of their structure : they are roughly spherical but end abruptly in a small point, their surfaces covered with a single layer of cells. On the surface of a cell, there is a patchy pattern of black and white dots, a kind of network of fine-scale, randomly oriented fibers that looks like lace. A closer view of these fibers reveals the presence of a nucleus. The cell wall is extremely thin, made of one layer of chitin, and is pierced by a single hair-like channel. At the ends of these fibers, one can visualize a kind of protuberance, which is probably due to the formation of a cell wall by the interaction of protists.\n\nThe protists to which those protuberances belong are unknown, but there are certain similarities : they seem to live in the vicinity of sulfate crystals in the sediment of lakes and estuaries, the water being rich in sulfate. At this time, the sulfate is probably not available in sufficient quantity to be an important constituent of the cell walls, and these small protuberances seem to have no use, as indicated by the fact that their surfaces are always empty. It could therefore be assumed that the protuberances exist only as a result of an interaction between the protists and the sulfate, an interaction which is probably important at a certain concentration of sulfate in the water. It could even be speculated that the sulfate is present in order to supply the protists with energy, which they would not obtain from sunlight, because at that time that part of the sediment was not exposed to the light. That hypothesis is certainly in conflict with our current knowledge of the properties of the protists.\n\nProtists are not only found in nature, but are also present in man. Some protist infections cause diseases like malaria in animals, others can be cultured. However, they are also important in the construction of the digestive apparatus of the amoebas which constitute a large portion of the protist population. Another very important function is played by microorganisms in the synthesis of organic materials.\n\nA good understanding of protists will lead to a better appreciation of what distinguishes life from nonliving things.","token_len":463,"entropy":[12.1161,1.2224,1.249,11.5877,7.035,6.4846,3.0183,9.195,6.447,2.9224,3.8651,1.1436,4.6727,0.9542,2.8272,9.7504,2.4198,1.5265,2.4421,1.9782,9.6539,2.6246,1.056,5.9842,2.712,4.8917,7.371,5.2607,2.2125,0.7532,3.9685,5.3855,2.3399,5.5504,5.2339,3.6608,0.8293,1.5163,4.7078,1.8584,0.081,5.5561,0.6998,5.0453,0.7398,2.519,0.8593,2.939,3.4172,0.5393,3.0533,0.7156,0.5219,6.3748,4.3041,5.5979,0.341,5.1581,2.2034,0.3333,4.152,1.5349,4.2403,5.7383,0.0075,8.5944,0.4208,6.4116,3.1283,3.2869,3.8573,8.0468,4.1984,4.1938,1.9792,6.5213,0.1866,9.4659,0.8361,3.5438,6.9935,2.9025,1.0405,2.3378,0.8872,0.96,2.202,4.1609,0.017,1.5919,4.8599,2.4272,1.8314,4.7798,4.9672,1.1997,6.427,1.517,0.8697,6.6314,0.4588,5.3765,1.4211,0.12,8.4564,0.9653,0.1787,1.2148,1.5574,2.8669,7.6014,0.4834,1.2232,2.3477,7.2981,2.1903,0.2479,8.0855,1.1296,4.0741,0.5009,3.732,0.2784,1.0737,0.7838,0.7978,4.9324,1.9627,8.1947,1.2812,5.5037,0.0004,7.0798,1.0508,0.0583,1.5514,2.5308,1.0395,6.1032,3.878,0.0185,0.7926,5.1637,0.0223,1.1328,4.9348,0.7058,3.61,1.4615,5.2884,0.0968,4.8767,7.0865,1.054,2.1216,0.07,1.8073,4.7036,7.5069,6.4043,1.9352,5.9868,1.5919,0.3599,0.415,1.6757,0.8677,6.4253,1.2357,0.5739,3.6579,0.6808,4.3347,5.2247,3.9418,2.2939,4.5431,0.0849,5.8549,0.6986,1.8004,3.9552,0.0222,10.3009,1.257,2.2168,2.4996,0.7153,4.7064,2.7736,5.2048,1.2258,6.0962,0.0039,0.0016,1.0638,4.5888,4.6939,4.5082,3.8051,0.177,0.7756,0.4154,1.51,4.4855,3.0399,2.2507,0.3007,1.3049,2.9439,0.1314,2.5868,4.6603,2.9368,3.5956,1.5051,4.5537,1.8361,0.6762,2.6105,4.6221,1.2237,3.8496,0.2587,0.9265,5.723,2.3595,1.6647,1.3107,4.2905,6.3222,1.4781,0.0066,0.0445,3.5919,0.1514,1.7606,3.94,4.9654,3.6667,2.2219,7.1596,0.0792,0.7554,3.4578,0.0232,3.4163,3.8384,0.5144,5.4831,7.4609,0.8325,3.9666,4.5406,2.7729,0.2768,4.116,0.0617,1.0644,1.4704,0.0381,0.1681,5.6453,2.1449,3.008,1.3748,1.9097,0.001,3.8232,1.809,0.4745,1.3614,2.8011,1.1867,0.7112,0.7381,2.2915,0.3648,1.9715,5.6321,0.9976,1.6093,1.9468,3.2722,5.869,4.7349,3.048,3.762,5.0295,2.9095,0.9945,0.0324,2.157,0.4472,1.8846,0.3568,3.5256,2.603,4.8285,0.1117,3.5737,0.0985,0.8922,2.2908,0.0444,1.5449,2.9574,0.5423,7.7631,0.03,5.8435,0.9351,2.7861,5.0054,0.1651,3.589,1.3433,1.9967,2.1531,2.1682,1.9653,4.0228,1.9994,5.6707,1.5122,3.103,5.5077,2.0298,2.6905,5.8083,6.9815,0.0526,0.1058,5.1196,1.5194,2.7933,4.7186,0.1678,1.0221,2.4234,1.5813,5.596,4.1848,0.958,4.8699,4.9869,3.3934,0.0122,3.8693,2.976,2.8301,0.9556,0.6928,6.0322,0.0663,1.2487,2.5418,4.4027,1.4574,0.7726,0.0003,8.72,3.9081,2.0181,2.6723,3.4354,3.772,0.3587,6.6953,0.5509,0.3437,2.8034,0.4317,3.106,0.1835,4.376,0.7969,4.2882,3.2452,2.9368,7.8745,4.1289,4.8049,3.6434,2.3741,3.9985,2.9827,0.8189,6.608,3.5436,1.7528,7.7185,3.8682,4.0539,0.0322,3.3528,0.6802,2.6211,4.429,1.3369,1.5005,4.4328,0.094,2.2217,5.9286,5.0854,1.3073,1.5777,9.5447,0.5055,0.0006,2.8151,4.4279,5.9166,3.01,2.5424,1.8415,0.0013,0.4532,7.1726,1.165,1.175,0.3064,6.3609,5.5256,0.4945,4.964,3.5269,9.2264,0.1941,6.293,0.1882,2.4503,0.5606,7.1088,0.1328,4.5516,2.8163,0.923,2.7294,0.0002,3.5137,5.2604,5.0597,0.0374,2.9327,1.3841,3.1298,2.9889,0.3519,1.657,1.2355,4.3096,0.0533,3.9472,5.7013,4.7958,0.3411,4.6828,3.8381,0.9728,0.5099]}
{"id":3019,"ended":true,"length":394,"text":"Dusky dolphins live in a fission @ - @ fusion society, with most group size increases occurring during foraging and decreases in group sizes occurring during resting and traveling. In the Golfo San Jorge, dusky dolphin group sizes ranged from four to nineteen dolphins ( Naylor and Fissel, 1988 ), and while they have not been observed to have formed family groups, they form stable social units ( Naylor and Fissel, 1988 ). Group sizes increase during foraging, with the maximum foraging group size observed in 18, compared to six dolphins in resting groups ( Naylor and Fissel, 1988 ). Smaller group sizes were observed in traveling than in foraging groups, ranging from two to five dolphins ( Naylor and Fissel, 1988 ).\n\nDusky dolphin group sizes are usually larger than the maximum adult size, and are similar to that of the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin ( Callovipo, 2008 ). Small adult individuals were observed in the Golfo San Jorge in 2002, while a large adult was observed in the Golfo de Santa Teresa ( Naylor and Fissel, 1988 ). Dusky dolphins are generally larger than their relative, the spotted dolphin ( Delphinus delphis ), the maximum being 1 m L ( Fissel et al., 1989 ). However, in the Gulf of California, spotted dolphins are 2.3 m L and dusky dolphins are 3.11 m L ( Cerr\u00f3n et al., 1990 ; Delphinus delphis, 1998 ). In the Gulf of California, adult spotted dolphins are between 1.2 m and 1.5 m ( Delphinus delphis, 1998 ). The body length in the southern Gulf of Baja is longer than the body length found in the northern coast ( Delphinus delphis, 1998 ). Dusky dolphins are larger than their cetacean friends in the northern Gulf of California, with body lengths up to 19 meters.

{"id":641,"ended":true,"length":428,"text":"Polka Party! received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Allmusic reviewer Eugene Chadbourne gave the album three stars and wrote that `` just about anyone could feel let down by this album.`` The album was the band`s first to appear on a major label -- Virgin Records, the biggest of the independents, and while ``Polka Party`s`` producer, the Canadian producer Bill Lacey, tried to capture the band`s rock-and-roll charm with minimal help from the band, the album`s sound did nothing to win over audiences. `\n\nThe band`s next two and final albums, 1992`s ``Dance On Top`` and 1994`s ``Rock U Later`` had even less commercial success. ``Dance On Top,`` a duet album on which all three members of the band contributed vocals, has become a rare collector`s item. Most critics panned the album as boring and bland, but the album is not without some fans, who swear that the album has some catchy moments. The 1993 single, ``Love Is Gone,`` also shows the band experimenting with a number of new elements. The band, however, decided to take a break from recording to tour in the United States and Europe, and in February 1999, Borko announced that Lenny was pregnant, and that the band would not be playing any more shows this year. ``We`re definitely taking a break,`` Lenny said ``I know there`s going to be rumors of us doing a reunion, but this is something I`ve planned for a very long time. I needed to make sure I was ready for both myself and a child.``\n\nThe band has been in the studio recording new songs, but Lenny says they will not be making more releases until 2005. While the band hasn`t played in concert regularly to this day, it still maintains a strong Internet presence on the website Lenny.Net, where it features new music and posts occasional messages from its members.\n\nThis website is part of the FamousFix entertainment community.\nBy continuing past this page, and by your continued use of this site, you agree to be bound by and abide by the Terms of Use.\nLoaded in 0.09 secs.","token_len":464,"entropy":[8.3849,8.8633,7.5722,11.9052,7.9304,9.2156,2.8179,1.4259,1.5569,3.4472,1.6947,6.6505,10.6598,8.1239,8.6075,9.2862,6.5162,4.8684,1.1074,3.2461,4.5311,0.7436,2.2023,4.1509,1.9236,12.158,11.0552,3.5638,3.664,2.69,5.4045,8.028,0.036,0.6831,1.4412,0.6443,0.9291,5.6052,2.4152,2.0842,1.8686,4.3115,4.3207,6.7826,0.0105,1.2245,3.3681,5.1253,0.2915,1.8411,1.3024,0.8196,6.238,11.1236,0.4307,1.7246,3.2284,3.8779,3.055,1.0918,5.8153,1.7295,1.2186,6.0119,7.3684,10.9532,0.0025,1.0397,1.3375,2.1024,6.5338,7.1077,1.9558,5.1841,8.0023,3.3794,4.6717,5.1642,4.6809,0.2105,6.7829,0.3711,7.1106,0.5756,3.3271,0.3225,0.0032,5.6802,2.0007,0.8392,0.0023,0.0239,5.2534,2.0168,6.7008,5.8139,0.5065,1.4679,1.9925,2.1764,1.4762,1.5217,5.6636,0.0023,4.4197,5.0431,4.9649,0.4397,5.4819,0.9451,5.0061,0.5539,6.2378,5.4579,0.0718,2.1604,2.2248,2.2094,0.0059,4.2759,4.322,6.949,3.3993,0.9465,0.9998,5.2291,3.0584,0.0747,1.7131,4.3928,3.2085,4.7449,5.4218,4.6126,0.1009,2.4016,0.2491,0.0476,0.2976,4.2439,7.3211,10.0529,2.7936,4.9356,6.0839,1.6087,6.4273,0.8058,1.1094,3.3319,1.4818,0.0118,0.1171,0.0027,5.0838,1.3609,2.232,6.8683,0.0053,5.5338,4.2941,2.7286,5.6042,1.8661,2.2733,3.2909,0.2369,0.2646,5.4498,2.0039,0.4022,4.7391,4.4744,1.0882,6.0112,5.8418,2.4948,0.0103,0.3831,1.2099,5.7747,3.0001,7.888,0.1985,0.4943,0.7001,1.7469,4.754,1.0789,4.2011,0.6637,1.7579,2.0486,2.1411,3.5589,4.0995,1.6692,4.499,6.6588,1.7996,1.9241,8.0211,2.012,1.4224,2.0308,3.1754,3.512,5.2673,4.297,1.1896,2.2797,6.9598,3.9919,1.6587,0.1925,5.0213,2.311,5.2885,1.2951,0.7092,4.1037,6.8264,1.8062,0.3829,8.0239,0.1988,2.7572,4.0778,0.1205,2.489,3.6449,1.5315,1.5656,2.1567,4.6774,2.4179,0.0136,6.0423,0.5894,3.2646,1.1082,2.037,0.4116,4.702,2.7276,5.3199,2.2056,2.1065,2.4478,0.0719,1.6809,2.2354,1.3346,1.8106,3.5432,4.0356,4.5945,0.9064,7.7853,8.7366,5.6173,4.5356,0.6866,7.9348,8.1107,2.639,6.6301,2.9231,1.2166,2.3531,1.6339,0.7714,0.8417,2.9235,0.9679,2.3767,2.273,1.4499,0.371,5.0496,0.9814,0.2268,2.6453,3.0571,2.7291,0.2725,5.6331,4.8962,0.8244,0.2603,2.302,4.1456,1.3555,0.1869,1.217,7.6288,3.7041,4.0669,3.7055,1.6597,0.0697,2.0466,0.0021,0.0079,7.4281,1.9499,2.0205,3.328,1.9635,2.7111,2.0222,0.6033,3.2677,0.8668,3.448,2.1636,1.7978,0.871,6.1748,0.7857,1.1449,3.5857,0.0625,0.0229,0.9527,1.88,8.8717,0.7206,2.6722,0.4602,1.8804,1.947,2.4269,0.8985,7.4493,5.9291,0.0553,5.0567,5.3896,1.3909,2.3985,1.8709,0.0005,1.8924,1.3348,3.1392,2.1096,3.1697,0.9055,1.027,4.0296,3.695,0.9262,2.7785,1.7948,3.9137,0.0423,2.1719,2.7598,2.8246,1.3707,0.7415,3.3316,3.342,4.3784,1.6564,5.4121,0.515,5.0498,1.3795,1.2981,4.6817,0.074,0.0005,3.7239,3.0087,4.5668,7.2412,5.7049,4.0684,2.0548,0.1116,2.6362,3.6827,4.4729,0.5806,2.871,8.7326,0.2384,3.5679,1.8797,4.0357,6.1448,0.2808,1.89,7.4009,1.3616,1.8637,2.0697,4.2105,4.2811,2.3524,1.7791,7.0423,7.6956,5.6283,1.8256,3.958,1.5236,0.2546,2.1074,0.0004,4.6047,6.9604,1.5307,4.4863,0.0035,0.9747,11.9381,11.4732,9.7433,3.9311,0.3963,2.5277,19.8633,7.3683,8.2439,1.4877,1.0205,0.6102,5.1762,2.7823,6.6305,1.9128,1.8972,0.457,1.66,0.3422,0.1476,0.2803,0.8317,0.2856,3.9051,0.1098,0.0287,7.5372,2.5169,0.0074,0.2802,1.9415,0.2812,0.3046,1.2114,2.3441,24.1435,3.7485,4.2878,7.7862,0.4555,4.8518,4.0619,1.7996,2.3977]}
{"id":2543,"ended":false,"length":405,"text":"There is little information about how and why Smart was released from asylum, but his daughter claimed : `` He grew better, and some misjudging friends who misconstrued Mr Newbery's great kindness, have not treated him with justice. I have never seen a kinder man. He is the truest friend I have on earth ``.\nIt may have been related to the fact that an acquaintance of his father, Mr E.B.E.D. Whitehead, who came from Australia to visit him in America, described him as, in his opinion, \" very queer and queering up \". Smart and his new stepfather later separated, due to the latter's bad temper.\nSmart had left Australia when he was 17 years old, as the result of a financial dispute with his father. He was not expected to return for some years, but on February 12, 1853, the _Argaumin_ reached Callao. He landed there, and stayed in Peru for the rest of his life.\nSoon after his arrival, Smart met a man named James Henry Green. Smart was instantly smitten by him, and the two married within a few days. Within six months of their marriage, however, they had become estranged and Green sued the _Argaumin_ for divorce; however, this lawsuit was eventually dismissed.\n\nSmart worked in a variety of occupations. When their divorce was heard in New South Wales, James Henry Green told the court that their marriage had been a mistake, that Smart was of \u201c a peculiar and badly-inclined disposition\u201d and frequently bad-mouthed him to family and friends.

{"id":1933,"ended":false,"length":369,"text":"Two Iguanodon species are currently considered to be nomina dubia : I. anglicus, described by Friedrich Holl in 1829, is the original type species of Iguanodon, but, as discussed above, is highly dubious on the molecular basis. On the other hand, a close relative of Iguanodon, the I. geographus, described by Friedrich M\u00fcller in 1869 from the holotype of the Brazilian specimen ( holotype NAX9 ), is widely regarded as synonymous with I. anglicus, thus, if both taxa, I. geographus and I. anglicus, are described as new species, there would be four accepted nominate species of I. anglicus, which would be the highest number of recognized species of any iguanodont. However, as illustrated on the following phylogenetic tree, the position of I. anglicus as a species of Iguanodon is likely to be doubtful :\n\nSpecies recognized\n\nCurrently recognized as species by at least one of the following lists :\n\nAs a result of more robust evidence against the I. anglicus holotype, the authors of the original description, Friedrich Holl and Friedrich M\u00fcller, did not consider it sufficient to nominate it as a type species, as described. Instead, they referred to it as holotype XA 9. However, in 2007, M\u00fcller's son, Heinz M\u00fcller, argued that holotype NAX11, based on a more recent fragment of the same skeleton and considered of lower quality, is almost certainly the holotype of I. anglicus, and therefore, was recommended to be the type species, as described ( and ). On the basis of the holotype XA 9 of I. geographus and the fact that the two specimens were apparently collected at roughly the same time and in the same location, it was considered by the author of a study on the Iguanodon anglicus holotype, Heinz M\u00fcller, that the holotype of I. geographus should now be designated holotype NAX11.

This was due to its position on the edge of a large water storage area, the site being selected for the development of the water supply scheme constructed by Bereswill; in 1914 water supplies and pumping works in the district were transferred to the City of Burnside from the District Council of East Torrens, which was renamed the Hills District Council.\n\nThe area of Hills District was named in honour of the City of Burnside and its suburbs, which have been named for various figures. Hills District is a short, unappealing name as well as being somewhat ambiguous. It would be appropriate to rename the area as Deans Hill. Deans Hill is a more appropriate name and more appropriate to the area of the Hills district.\n\nThe Hills district was named after Lord Deans' Hill which is located in Deanshill and consists of a grassy knoll.

{"id":504,"ended":false,"length":440,"text":"Rebbie's brother Michael died on June 25, 2009, after suffering a cardiac arrest. His memorial service was held twelve days later on July 7, and the finale featured group renditions of the final verse of \"My Father's World.\" Michael was a lifelong fan (\"We all are\") of the show, and he made two attempts to make it on The Simpsons. He was first turned down by show creator Matt Groening for an \"episode called Life on the Simpsons\" which never got off the drawing board, then by creator Al Jean in the episode \"The Itchy & Scratchy & Douche & Fart Man\" when Michael wanted to be in the background. Following his death, the Simpsons paid tribute to Michael with the song \"Til Death Do Us Parr\" in the Season 17 episode \"Homer the Heretic\". The line \"He liked to watch The Simpsons re-runs \/ He died from a cardiac attack\" was also used in the episode. A picture of Michael and his brother Steve are both featured in a photo montage montage of Simpsons characters. The writers and producers also went to Disney California Adventure in Anaheim where Michael and Steve lived and paid tribute to them, showing and talking about some of their paintings and statues, and placing a plaque with Michael and Steve's names on the monument. His sister Rebbie and her husband Steve have also appeared in an episode. In Season 17 episode \"Homer the Heretic\", Michael and Steve's deaths inspired the Simpson family to look after one of their many cats, Marge, after she was struck by a car. His sister Rebbie was the primary catalyst for that. When asked in an interview after Michael's death by the LA Times if she had a reason to appear in the show, Rebbie remarked, \"Michael was such a huge fan of The Simpsons that this made total sense\". The first time Michael and his wife attended a live Simpsons taping, he wore a tie like the character Ned Flanders.\n\nSinger Paul Williams, who had been friends with Michael for 20 years, has said that The Simpsons owes a debt to Michaels legacy.\n\n\"I would be proud to know that it would honor Steve and Michael who were two great artists who are gone far too soon through illness.\"\n\nReferences","token_len":467,"entropy":[10.2285,3.3403,6.5714,6.0525,5.2468,2.8219,3.2476,3.4185,0.5817,3.6732,1.1758,2.2108,3.3065,0.8188,3.4979,0.0425,1.3952,2.8119,8.9915,0.7859,1.085,0.4054,12.3254,0.5693,0.3543,2.7096,1.6302,3.2115,0.5863,4.3695,2.2661,10.1152,4.5748,10.1416,8.4569,0.0453,0.2497,1.8948,5.3729,5.5596,0.8212,1.6146,4.5636,3.618,1.5033,8.043,0.7926,4.3606,1.8482,2.6674,5.1648,1.6765,10.1462,4.0059,3.1017,4.2566,3.064,1.5549,1.6232,3.0152,0.9422,0.5932,2.1056,4.705,5.3219,6.0709,0.4961,3.5369,1.3189,3.1168,4.0792,3.8082,1.2605,1.9142,1.9186,5.9735,6.7857,0.3575,1.4708,5.7087,2.384,2.1151,0.0109,0.0001,2.8572,2.8828,4.7038,5.9632,6.5717,6.849,2.1239,1.2354,3.6445,1.2251,4.4755,5.3956,2.5261,0.5859,0.0436,8.2101,0.0203,1.6564,5.1865,3.8101,4.2215,7.1161,1.5262,4.7978,3.1219,5.1389,0.389,2.2878,8.207,0.3054,0.7795,0.0317,0.0031,0.0,8.6217,8.2715,0.0207,8.701,5.1703,2.7794,6.7965,1.2885,3.5077,4.5634,5.1818,0.5455,2.9309,3.5785,0.9944,6.8902,1.0685,6.0888,1.7293,1.3051,0.4273,2.1072,3.0404,7.2072,0.3836,0.0633,1.0679,2.5723,2.4213,3.591,0.2418,4.4026,4.5627,2.5495,0.3981,0.026,7.8167,6.4428,1.0309,3.4318,2.8163,4.4502,6.0656,1.3521,0.145,4.3053,2.5402,2.4264,8.3754,0.031,3.2307,2.6658,5.5517,0.8409,3.6603,7.6074,1.1672,4.2542,4.1034,0.2143,9.5359,3.4539,1.0491,6.4988,2.3371,5.6316,3.9492,1.3574,3.8254,4.2442,2.0328,0.988,1.8895,1.6914,1.1114,0.5608,1.2689,4.9819,4.5727,6.3353,0.1976,0.4762,3.1291,1.0876,1.883,6.5567,5.0023,7.6002,2.2105,0.971,2.2786,3.5656,4.378,0.0004,6.3793,0.0056,1.866,5.7005,1.8621,1.6564,2.3408,8.2647,2.3805,0.87,3.2677,5.6275,1.9396,6.8168,5.455,1.184,2.3737,2.9102,3.992,1.582,2.2154,0.6228,4.6055,2.4846,6.958,1.2639,0.1282,1.6167,2.8202,5.426,6.7991,3.9801,0.4312,6.1322,0.0886,0.9234,8.6575,1.2816,6.4996,2.4273,1.7048,7.4544,1.9714,2.9076,3.0695,1.9441,2.8972,0.3578,0.4699,1.4162,0.6736,1.0261,6.3755,0.7242,6.6242,4.0575,7.7917,9.4247,0.3532,3.1314,1.6577,1.8726,4.2662,4.4232,0.8709,3.1077,0.827,3.87,1.1721,2.3557,3.1134,4.9315,2.895,3.1544,0.1014,3.0651,0.0564,0.2737,0.2384,0.0002,0.628,1.2524,1.189,0.2616,3.0153,7.7862,5.2732,1.4295,6.1483,2.0106,0.3931,6.4281,3.8484,4.3309,1.0097,0.5547,5.731,5.4955,1.2364,5.212,1.0255,1.33,3.2094,1.846,1.4122,5.5461,0.1667,0.9692,1.2592,1.2005,5.3984,2.772,2.3314,0.4449,0.0084,2.323,3.4124,5.4442,5.8782,0.5769,4.7304,2.1062,4.4858,4.3506,4.3743,1.6956,0.2239,4.3564,2.3947,0.6023,0.0955,4.1116,2.6925,6.9822,0.2042,2.4822,1.7916,2.3679,2.8857,6.3059,0.6656,7.6733,0.6914,0.7215,1.8012,0.5287,1.9965,0.0097,0.0015,5.8027,0.9255,0.0334,6.5382,1.5258,3.4932,0.2165,4.4798,1.1566,0.4834,1.6315,0.0191,1.8782,6.3334,4.9139,9.9837,0.0075,4.982,2.5131,4.5979,2.1389,1.6122,2.2579,2.2239,3.4332,6.5858,1.6416,3.8303,3.5348,5.5738,0.0369,1.4385,2.284,5.3012,0.6485,5.1295,6.5678,1.871,4.149,6.5512,2.0728,0.0004,2.1213,2.2231,0.001,4.7045,3.9039,5.6512,6.9661,2.8959,1.1182,3.1242,1.8494,6.2137,0.0236,0.6033,1.2859,5.0628,0.0555,0.4052,3.8022,2.8583,0.745,6.0196,0.0246,6.1261,2.6258,0.9608,0.9994,11.524,11.7706,1.0007,1.8892,0.0002,3.1175,2.0007,3.8839,3.2367,3.8987,0.7632,4.5081,0.886,3.9338,3.3856,8.4563,6.431,1.6684,1.9951,5.5745,2.1289,4.2645,3.1313,4.6964,1.9144,4.2499,6.2565,8.1881,1.1211,0.472,8.8794,5.7629,3.1759,1.0231,0.0002,5.5113]}

{"id":4966,"ended":false,"length":440,"text":"Sucker Punch elected to set Second Son in their hometown of Seattle as they could draw from their personal experiences in the open world's design. During early development when team members debated where the game would be set, one individual suggested they should base the game in Southern California, based on what they knew about it. However, due to an executive request, the team chose to keep their game \"more grounded.\"\"Seattle was the best city we could find. It was a smaller town, with a real feeling to it. We'd been looking everywhere for this [the open world] and it became a real struggle. We found Seattle through a chance meeting with Ubisoft and we started to really love it,\" said Creative Director Seth Gordon.The team drew inspiration from the Seattle music and arts scene in setting the game to match those elements. \"Seattle has one of the best music communities in America. It's amazing here. There's always a jam session going on in Ballard. Even in the clubs you'll hear people that went to Berklee, and a guy there right now going to New York. The local art scene is incredible. It's where we ended up because of what it had to offer.\"The game's soundtrack will also be heavily influenced by the city, with local bands providing cover versions of the album's original material. The music will be created in real-time by the musicians playing within their set locations as well.For the first time in the series, gamers can explore the Seattle open world both above ground and underwater. Using their diving gear, players can explore the many secluded beaches, urban canyons and coastal waterfalls that are both natural and man-made. Sucker Punch plans to expand the game's playable open-water level as the release date draws near.The PlayStation 4 title is also the first Second Son game to utilize the PS4's DualShock 4 controller's six-axis motion-capture system. Gordon revealed that the team has \"a different idea\" for the gameplay of the game than for the previous PS3 title, which is how the controller was employed.\"We're using it in a slightly different way as far as the core of how the game is played,\" he said.\n\nJonathon Dornbush is an Associate Editor for IGN.

Bennett will report directly to new UMD President Wallace Loh.","token_len":469,"entropy":[9.1343,2.1392,3.2318,5.3091,10.5302,0.1812,9.1916,0.155,0.7253,8.4239,16.2024,1.4563,3.4058,9.8769,6.7052,0.0004,2.712,3.7942,10.661,0.2444,2.45,8.1796,8.274,15.464,6.5195,5.0656,10.7365,12.1296,4.7772,4.3493,7.3879,3.07,4.1634,1.9208,7.0827,0.0552,2.849,0.8,1.0584,0.0168,1.1607,2.2971,0.0057,1.5867,2.4925,1.3942,1.6192,2.5857,0.3271,0.0017,0.1454,0.0058,0.0807,0.1617,2.2747,0.0009,0.0022,0.001,0.002,0.0001,0.0057,0.0538,0.0591,0.002,0.0044,0.0035,0.0043,0.0323,5.3198,0.0414,0.0139,0.0539,0.0011,0.0015,0.0003,0.0055,0.002,0.001,0.0008,0.0004,0.0117,0.0006,0.0006,0.0006,0.0005,1.5382,0.0002,6.2724,2.5101,1.9393,1.227,3.824,1.797,3.6765,6.2976,2.4211,7.6657,6.2624,0.1075,1.0968,5.061,0.1219,2.1018,0.5095,5.4048,5.6018,5.0934,1.1631,2.3769,2.5167,1.4411,2.2036,0.0003,1.5783,4.1205,2.1925,4.6359,5.8997,0.3634,0.2329,0.4716,5.5407,3.8638,3.9471,2.2493,7.6664,1.1309,2.8343,4.3682,6.4937,1.6088,2.5647,5.9376,4.0204,3.2023,2.4932,0.082,2.6063,1.6187,3.9685,6.9362,4.6114,6.0444,0.0403,1.2083,7.1409,3.7512,1.1823,2.85,5.0409,1.6295,2.7907,3.3536,5.2026,1.3037,6.4869,0.1155,1.6851,7.4159,3.8927,0.2429,3.987,0.7544,1.2532,4.4051,2.8151,4.4695,1.6856,3.3703,0.0082,0.1423,3.7487,4.1831,3.3289,5.1837,2.3026,0.9171,6.7981,0.1274,5.3161,3.8259,3.3203,5.2872,5.439,5.6425,4.7555,9.129,1.502,0.6369,7.2016,0.291,4.2323,1.0253,1.4568,0.2669,0.3738,0.0002,5.0122,0.669,4.8286,0.0113,0.2695,5.2567,0.4628,5.8908,0.1813,2.8685,3.8588,2.6476,2.6633,0.056,0.0625,3.2831,0.2847,2.6037,0.032,4.0671,1.2599,4.997,0.6896,1.5162,0.3427,1.3327,2.3184,5.9227,3.5025,2.9758,2.395,1.134,0.4395,7.5595,0.0187,2.4108,5.9499,1.2644,4.7004,6.7097,5.759,3.5322,2.2989,2.7083,1.3911,3.1161,0.3293,3.4452,1.9866,0.3886,0.6129,0.0003,1.4388,4.7432,0.0212,3.5754,0.0982,0.9803,0.0002,3.9944,0.6225,0.9823,5.1375,0.1769,0.2032,2.0172,1.2504,5.9462,1.8327,0.8985,1.881,2.2701,6.8024,0.002,1.5204,0.0097,0.9886,7.7441,3.6397,4.7045,1.852,4.3483,4.5403,0.1159,0.4847,1.3217,1.2674,4.3856,2.5029,0.8405,0.0236,0.0037,1.533,6.2378,0.9008,4.0364,2.1882,2.4723,0.0002,3.4755,1.4221,3.5979,1.1643,5.6791,5.1309,3.8271,0.4726,1.9047,4.3993,0.0289,0.0943,4.2509,8.9477,6.0553,1.5975,2.5546,5.3228,1.2706,0.1235,3.4019,4.1812,5.4789,1.6485,2.4315,3.6443,1.3189,0.5532,2.2787,0.7253,0.7402,0.9542,0.0003,1.3479,4.1805,3.1184,5.4731,0.5341,2.8157,1.6095,0.3069,0.8004,0.9902,1.3507,1.5839,0.0002,4.6099,0.0322,0.8413,0.0466,1.1255,1.2284,4.9941,0.0504,1.0664,0.7164,2.2499,0.196,2.7925,0.0197,0.6628,0.8835,0.9284,2.7442,1.1359,4.0379,6.5046,4.3676,1.0953,3.9629,3.0408,6.9568,1.0727,0.043,0.177,2.4562,1.0357,2.9785,1.7812,1.471,1.7687,0.9045,2.0068,5.2258,5.7716,2.1265,4.2887,1.1367,6.0665,3.8442,0.3378,4.8562,1.9154,0.4619,5.6665,3.1436,3.7118,0.4501,0.0003,1.4265,1.6755,1.9223,3.4328,1.7954,1.0568,1.5802,3.3714,3.6147,0.0157,0.6929,4.646,5.1284,0.7633,2.4735,3.7307,0.0063,2.1712,4.7464,0.7574,1.8879,5.4129,3.224,1.0853,3.8851,0.3627,1.1623,1.0424,0.0002,1.3287,1.8264,2.5668,5.1344,3.4143,4.1664,1.0543,5.2464,6.9742,6.783,1.5059,1.1995,0.7114,6.1601,4.6866,0.014,0.8127,1.7743,5.8435,0.0061,0.0579,3.9545,0.2349,0.5792,5.9656,0.7471,2.621,0.0582,2.5249,1.8597,0.6522,2.1029,2.6109,3.5702,1.8951,0.0247,7.4532,3.0221,0.037,1.7211,7.6975,4.7281,5.3357,1.9559]}

{"id":1990,"ended":false,"length":348,"text":"The closely related species Verpa conica typically has a smooth cap, although specimens with wrinkled caps are known. V. conica may be distinguished microscopically by its eight @ - @ spored asci. V. crassula is distinguished from Verpa conica by its three- to four-spored asci, usually smooth or wrinkled (3-5-spored) cap, and by the presence of four (occasionally 5) @- @ spored sporangia arising on the upper margin of the sporangium, and generally two (occasionally three) @ - @ spored spore-bearing stony basidia.\n\nSpecies related to Verpa conica but not in the genus Verpa include:\n\nVerpa flavimarginata Bres.\n\nFungus Verpa Bres. is found in the woody tissues of coniferous trees, but a typical specimen of the species is much more wrinkled than in many other fungi.\n\nDescription\n\nVerpa species have a smooth cap which is often more or less wrinkled. The flesh is white to yellowish with a waxy consistency and a dry crumbly texture. The edges and suture are yellowish and the hymenium is yellowish.\n\nOn microscopic examination, the spore-bearing stroma consists of two distinct layers. The upper layer has a smooth surface. If it contains spores, the pores are visible; if they contain asci and spores, the pores are small. The base of the upper layer is covered by a layer of irregular spore-bearing cells. The spore-bearing layer is somewhat thicker (0.5 mm) than the cap. The microscopic spore shape is elliptical, with a width of 1.2-1.4 mm ; it may be slightly inflated, with a small depression at the apex. The cap is usually cylindrical (2-3 mm), and may be up to 5.5 x 4 mm. The margin is slightly flattened.\n\nDistribution\n\nVerpa species are distributed in coniferous forests in Europe, and in the North American north-west.\n\nBiology\n\nVerpa species have been used in traditional medicine in India and China.\n\nReferences","token_len":471,"entropy":[10.5108,2.0476,6.2667,7.8659,8.1504,8.1853,3.6781,7.8017,2.9658,1.0922,5.8116,7.1084,2.2893,4.8104,6.2955,2.504,5.6516,0.216,3.2762,1.9323,2.9698,3.0465,6.1646,2.0216,0.8962,0.0126,3.9585,1.0481,3.1238,14.0524,0.0038,0.0006,1.9512,1.4235,9.2514,12.7505,5.5924,6.4183,5.7292,10.1068,8.1197,5.4995,6.3277,3.5986,0.0329,7.8408,1.787,6.0225,1.0418,5.2427,1.5375,3.162,0.149,0.7351,0.0034,0.2839,0.467,3.8058,3.8333,4.9053,0.7868,0.055,0.8068,0.0861,3.3114,0.0079,2.1769,6.4601,7.6294,3.1435,3.4137,0.0322,4.6196,5.5203,1.9977,2.0517,2.2773,3.8548,0.5339,1.7139,4.4603,2.2754,1.5022,3.0451,1.6154,3.9823,0.0474,3.3192,6.2807,7.0039,0.1777,4.7396,2.2776,3.6494,3.6855,0.797,0.1908,0.0413,9.095,1.9665,4.6965,10.1373,4.0016,0.6523,3.6266,2.8211,0.457,0.3624,7.7848,0.0444,2.4658,2.5547,2.4756,6.3474,4.8418,1.52,0.5931,0.0188,1.5658,0.1948,0.6506,2.0898,0.4244,0.0472,0.0367,1.5829,1.6619,2.2029,3.1667,4.917,4.617,7.0198,1.6414,1.2037,2.3481,0.0013,6.1246,0.0144,7.5524,0.2139,0.8275,0.0128,0.1904,0.0014,7.1682,1.242,4.3357,2.0808,1.8417,1.5799,0.1335,8.2358,1.4654,1.0851,0.0003,2.5439,0.1239,8.4248,8.0376,7.1163,3.1968,2.0424,6.4951,6.7675,4.3412,2.3528,0.0003,5.0509,3.6546,1.3772,3.6722,0.1644,7.1691,0.0913,0.1324,9.7776,3.6595,0.5804,1.6232,5.854,1.3501,5.6912,0.2646,6.3784,1.8437,0.3794,1.409,1.557,2.6131,5.3858,5.9931,1.4487,2.5011,1.7034,2.3594,0.7911,6.545,2.2008,8.117,0.1836,1.4731,3.4124,4.8176,0.9483,6.7861,0.5854,1.4848,0.0002,6.1374,1.1989,0.0002,2.0484,0.0374,5.4409,2.9096,1.6281,2.4688,0.8054,4.3276,1.1326,3.3573,5.3987,3.6506,0.0067,2.1252,0.0345,1.9975,1.5802,6.1686,0.9631,4.2516,3.3891,3.072,0.6736,2.9801,1.2301,5.7784,0.3084,4.8051,2.4289,2.5406,6.4278,8.4988,2.7072,0.9896,2.9277,0.4758,0.832,6.987,4.0896,6.6899,1.9595,1.4256,4.9127,0.9671,2.1294,2.4828,8.0068,3.287,7.1196,0.8414,3.6581,0.5223,1.3765,2.1564,0.0002,5.6215,6.8911,0.1229,0.46,0.7849,4.1242,0.4508,0.7342,0.1675,0.8135,9.1482,5.1582,0.1604,2.2348,4.1851,4.2297,2.0176,0.5452,3.352,0.8521,2.7647,0.8457,3.167,2.9353,3.8152,6.5318,3.226,4.5946,4.4709,0.5594,1.251,6.4696,1.2389,6.0473,3.9251,0.731,1.2442,1.5853,8.5432,0.8451,3.6325,1.773,0.19,0.8061,1.1552,0.1622,4.9617,0.9931,1.1023,6.2331,0.8341,0.115,4.3874,0.2244,0.5168,3.4714,0.9946,0.8426,3.2317,0.0962,6.6781,3.6959,0.2361,0.2052,0.2312,4.6543,0.9863,0.9021,1.9625,0.0431,0.1348,0.0296,4.6434,1.0013,5.8664,3.8666,4.2517,4.3634,0.0553,1.2947,1.6295,0.6825,0.6293,0.2997,5.3971,1.2125,0.8654,7.6173,5.8274,0.046,8.1471,0.6328,5.6624,0.1123,1.4388,1.7129,1.4399,5.8592,0.4104,3.1109,1.4249,3.0442,4.2745,0.9077,0.0644,2.0063,0.1112,8.8943,2.6831,3.0234,0.571,3.9546,8.1229,2.2534,2.9288,1.0733,4.4566,7.4337,1.9941,0.2805,3.3405,0.9597,0.7871,3.4841,1.0482,3.446,5.2106,0.0,0.0132,2.9832,3.1166,1.6855,0.7572,0.3464,2.3954,1.6918,3.2448,0.7122,6.2879,0.0144,3.2193,2.9548,0.7266,5.7825,2.255,2.2861,1.955,0.9257,4.6169,1.4536,3.762,3.1302,1.7497,1.4767,0.0003,5.3724,0.1043,0.2577,0.0002,2.846,0.0181,1.873,0.8033,2.8378,1.3234,4.482,0.1708,0.0157,1.0743,2.0415,3.4627,0.7154,3.7981,1.2947,1.5042,2.945,0.4964,5.1369,2.1638,1.6519,0.5205,2.0896,0.0002,3.9429,1.3602,0.243,0.0002,1.6045,0.02,1.1768,2.1929,3.3185,3.9635,1.941,5.4868,0.5635,3.1978,5.5111,1.5158,2.1599,1.2707,1.9789,0.0002,5.5425]}

This victory in the Western Conference finals was the first since 1969.\n\nIn the 1994 \u2013 95 season, the Bulls lost the first game against the Indiana Pacers, but they were able to beat them, win the second round of the playoffs and reach the Eastern Conference finals and the finals.\n\nOn one occasion, MJ threw a perfect pass to Dennis Johnson, who was waiting for it on the baseline. Jordan had the ball on the side of the free throw. Johnson passed to Michael Jordan, who was beyond the free throw and threw a perfect pass again to Dennis Johnson. He threw a pass to Dennis Johnson, who was standing under the basket. John Lucas II and Doug Collins made a fast break and Collins threw a pass to Jordan, who was inside the basket and he scored a triple.\n\nJordan ended up scoring 50,000 points for his career in game number 60, but in his last year he managed the second-best average ever for a season. His season average was 33,6 ppg and as well as the season record of 2,560 points scored.\n\nIn 1994 \u2013 95 the Bulls completed a third consecutive championship. To this date, Jordan is considered the \u201cbest\u201d player in basketball history. He also won most titles as a player: six titles. He is the only player in the history of the NBA to win MVP in seven consecutive seasons. In the 1991 \u2013 92 season, Jordan averaged 30 ppg.\n\nIn the 1992 \u2013 93 season, Jordan played in only 15 games due to an ACL damage.

{"id":1976,"ended":true,"length":441,"text":"Phoenix Wright : Ace Attorney is the first entry in the series. It was originally released for the Game Boy Advance in 2001 in Japan ; it has also been released for the Nintendo DS and PSP, as well as the PC. Phoenix Wright : Ace Attorney features an episodic format, with each installment having its own story.\nIt also introduces a new, more complex form of visual \"popping\" (i.e. text bubbles, character sprites, etc.) which the franchise has since used for much of its later games, in addition to a new courtroom system (reusing the original's and expanding it considerably). Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Miles Edgeworth is an enhanced version of the first Phoenix Wright game, featuring the entire cast as playable characters and additional scenarios.\nThe game was released as two separate titles for the Game Boy Advance - Phoenix Wright : Ace Attorney Investigations and Phoenix Wright : Ace Attorney Investigations 02 - due to the differences in content between the two. Phoenix Wright is the series creator and main protagonist, as both a defense attorney and a practicing lawyer.\nA further entry in the series, Apollo Justice, was released in 2003 for the Game Boy Advance and PSP, and was followed by Ace Attorney Trilogy in 2015 and Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice in 2016. The original series was the basis for numerous spin-offs in the franchise such as the Ace Attorney anime series and comic books. The series has inspired at least four major role-playing video game adaptations, including the mobile game Ace Attorney: Justice For All Saga, the visual novel of the same name and two titles which served as the basis for the iOS game-turned-web-series Justice For All and the mobile game The Phoenix Wright Murder Mystery.\nAce Attorney is renowned for its realistic presentation of criminal cases, such as forensics and fingerprint techniques, as well as its legal-realist style of dialogue. The series also featured several recurring roles for its cast, including Wright's assistant, assistant state\u2019s attorney, and witness, as well as recurring supporting characters such as Wright\u2019s best friend, Miles Edgeworth, and his rival and best friend in the courtroom. In addition to the three main games, an additional spin-off, Phoenix Wright : Ace Attorney - Trials and Tribulations, was released in 2010 for smartphones.","token_len":472,"entropy":[9.5285,8.1733,8.5659,1.6215,3.8199,2.6225,2.1908,4.7825,0.3454,0.5448,1.8102,2.0423,1.7858,1.539,2.5579,1.4108,2.4153,1.1356,3.8963,0.6158,0.8158,1.1996,3.7873,4.4579,0.4555,9.1502,1.1721,2.8292,3.1067,0.3417,0.8742,0.9162,0.2099,1.8597,0.7919,1.4844,3.8363,3.2289,1.9037,0.0713,0.0342,1.2032,3.9462,1.5867,6.5492,0.0042,1.2433,0.0632,0.0005,7.041,2.5656,5.4844,0.0017,4.4153,1.268,1.5294,2.8063,2.7404,3.6285,1.2718,0.0161,1.2772,1.7286,2.4173,8.897,2.5174,4.6915,1.9706,0.6489,5.3284,2.7008,3.7166,5.0169,0.048,7.7794,7.0976,6.9066,3.1193,1.1013,3.4476,3.6879,0.0018,0.0005,1.0718,7.4755,4.4097,2.8226,6.567,2.6699,0.3335,1.284,1.0979,2.4962,4.4564,7.6519,1.061,4.0752,4.9699,2.3584,3.8141,0.2638,0.3919,6.0246,1.8698,2.2091,4.0955,1.8559,0.0057,2.8777,1.8798,11.0285,1.6177,3.1254,7.0442,6.9656,1.1977,2.7937,5.2431,5.9398,5.6105,1.9596,5.492,0.7688,4.6467,0.0027,8.2636,3.725,2.3743,9.4394,5.0229,0.017,0.002,1.9582,2.5664,4.9219,0.4297,0.0393,0.6641,2.5422,6.2422,0.0106,1.4002,0.9371,3.6157,2.228,5.4138,3.8736,3.439,3.7738,0.2374,2.5764,4.7653,6.2767,0.8663,1.1377,1.967,2.6939,2.4211,1.5636,2.5583,4.9469,1.3468,3.2718,2.557,0.2559,0.7792,0.1962,0.215,5.9928,2.3304,0.0415,3.2643,0.8906,0.0022,1.6025,2.448,0.9491,0.0209,0.8766,0.3527,0.0059,1.8392,7.7833,2.1909,6.1164,0.2661,1.1912,4.2074,0.5356,4.8836,0.7872,0.6868,0.2364,1.445,3.2045,0.0738,4.6292,1.5292,5.3923,6.13,1.7005,5.3329,1.5686,0.8374,3.434,5.3075,5.4273,8.5223,0.2181,0.2948,0.9808,8.3331,1.2406,0.4906,1.6011,3.7364,7.6185,5.4519,0.4502,0.091,0.2717,1.3711,7.1006,3.1358,1.3388,1.4479,0.4099,1.3286,2.6049,1.3044,0.0703,0.4362,0.073,0.1943,1.7034,3.7361,1.519,1.4518,1.7653,3.6569,0.2931,1.7702,0.0099,6.0748,2.7958,6.6391,2.5945,2.291,0.0247,0.4163,0.1221,0.0051,4.1575,6.2949,0.5802,0.321,0.49,1.1126,0.2171,2.38,4.2399,2.2377,1.3701,3.9492,5.1206,0.3405,5.6644,3.3782,0.3601,0.5051,3.2023,0.3037,2.7992,3.8883,0.0007,3.1326,2.279,0.007,5.0909,1.0206,1.4787,8.1386,1.3004,1.0275,2.3764,1.7658,1.9555,6.8306,6.619,0.0342,2.8392,4.8486,7.6508,0.2376,0.0281,2.9883,2.3019,1.3357,1.153,1.0203,1.3903,6.9735,0.7367,1.675,0.0234,0.6439,4.0806,4.3809,0.1184,9.4757,1.282,0.9779,7.6181,0.148,4.4012,0.6577,1.881,0.0179,1.7589,3.8424,6.8337,4.4548,6.8903,0.0526,1.202,1.4288,0.1034,0.8003,7.9615,1.5902,6.3934,5.3222,0.097,6.0601,1.9638,2.4028,5.8439,3.2404,0.1038,4.1118,0.4948,3.04,0.4033,3.9584,3.8796,0.0623,8.8181,1.2562,0.9115,0.7421,2.4722,2.4869,0.0161,3.2376,8.7142,0.2399,0.427,6.5073,5.4788,1.2781,5.163,0.9577,0.8305,4.2352,0.0033,9.103,0.0198,1.5711,6.6271,7.234,0.8242,2.2125,0.0768,0.0044,1.5353,6.8625,4.7166,6.1675,2.2736,2.699,1.831,5.377,0.9505,1.758,1.1582,1.868,3.9444,2.5863,6.3699,4.9948,2.2901,3.2852,3.5236,1.15,0.768,5.9655,1.7572,4.36,2.282,6.7961,7.6136,17.003,7.458,3.3431,3.7883,1.0831,1.1262,6.1733,1.9072,1.7999,0.0224,0.0043,5.5842,4.3556,0.4271,1.1381,0.0024,3.3643,10.2215,0.6887,0.239,4.8088,0.1086,0.9035,6.7422,0.0297,0.0,0.0001,0.8475,1.1019,2.4436,6.3704,3.8732,4.3288,0.1724,5.35,0.9448,2.0795,0.553,3.1474,0.6148,0.832,1.3925,4.5328,1.7152,5.1684,0.5875,5.2939,1.1056,4.8175,0.0728,0.002,1.858,1.1493,0.4333,4.4397,0.8696,0.0091,2.5305,5.7881,1.811,0.1084,0.1339,0.9505,0.6328,0.4575,1.0703,3.777,0.7566,9.381,1.7889]}
{"id":554,"ended":true,"length":432,"text":"The total complement of proteins present at a time in a cell or cell type is known as its proteome, and the study of such large @ - @ scale data sets defines the frontier of computational biology. As computers improve, protein structure@properties and folding@activity models, including protein folding @theory, arise as two main @focus areas for computational biologists.\n\nA variety of bioinformatics software tools for protein @folding@ prediction have been developed over the past decade; for example, Rosetta, Proteo, and Protein.NET. The problem remains, though, and is not fully solvable with such bioinformatics tools as to solve practical science problems in an automated manner. The use of supercomputers to compute protein structures@properties and to fold@theories to improve protein @folding@ prediction has become a leading @frontier of supercomputing.\n\nHere we report our initial attempt to @automatically solve an important subset of protein folding problems in which protein structures@properties are obtained directly, without having to use any simulation tools. In this paper we investigate @the problem of predicting active forms, or forms of proteins that have evolved to be more stable in the environment and in vivo, by systematically perturbing protein structures@properties within existing theoretical models. Active forms are important in many biological processes, such as the formation of protein complexes and interactions between cellular macromolecular assemblies. @We aim to solve active form prediction both as a computational biology@problem and as an essential step for improving theoretical models of protein folding@.\n\nThe @research approach@ to the problem consists in constructing a set of @folds@ or folding@models@ in which the active forms are predicted, each of which is evaluated individually. Then, we compute the probability that each model exhibits the observed folding@properties. We then assess the probability of all possible values of the probability that can be achieved. A @posteriori probability@ estimate of the probability of active folding forms is then computed, based on this probabilistic evaluation and the set of experimental folding conditions. Finally, we investigate the convergence rate of each model set. In general, our approach achieves convergence to an upper bound. For many possible sets @of experiments, however, we are able to establish an approximate best model.","token_len":473,"entropy":[7.6926,10.5756,0.7602,8.5138,4.1615,3.0858,4.0356,4.0946,3.2744,2.6353,2.5527,5.0199,4.0072,2.2198,1.022,3.5351,1.0682,4.5818,6.5772,0.6388,2.2248,1.3284,1.8314,7.5877,0.2106,4.6344,6.1367,14.8742,7.3256,6.6048,9.0064,4.8077,0.4753,8.0359,0.9465,12.7183,0.9263,3.9759,1.5327,0.4909,4.2497,8.2801,4.2853,0.8347,6.889,4.0786,14.38,12.2953,3.1276,8.6984,1.9706,8.1203,7.7707,3.3991,3.8723,3.5141,1.5977,6.1036,6.8541,0.8617,0.564,6.6425,3.4778,7.337,4.8914,9.6874,8.6974,1.3936,1.5215,1.4762,3.2007,0.428,2.5727,0.003,3.3582,5.6085,0.0023,6.1277,0.5284,0.1431,0.0008,5.43,2.6392,4.0554,2.2951,5.3607,8.2825,0.2262,2.3556,10.5717,2.117,0.2066,0.3991,2.8208,0.076,0.9589,1.152,4.2915,3.7727,0.3451,0.0555,9.3017,1.3358,2.1348,7.4014,0.4988,5.6285,1.0644,1.2833,5.2576,4.0975,7.6506,2.3963,1.9659,6.4817,5.0988,1.9207,2.6259,0.1014,4.384,2.8658,2.8142,4.5533,5.6827,0.0006,3.5717,3.4877,7.8675,0.06,0.0585,0.0022,0.5299,3.8245,7.3608,4.0624,8.8903,6.9514,0.8728,2.7272,4.0411,3.669,1.461,0.2407,2.5009,5.5932,0.023,6.9676,0.975,0.1521,1.2342,3.5569,1.6131,3.7082,2.4837,1.2894,1.7613,3.9581,4.6948,1.902,5.4315,3.9918,5.5495,5.072,2.7149,3.3833,2.334,0.015,0.1814,0.7769,1.8381,2.7784,1.3217,5.3325,5.816,7.5809,0.1699,1.6506,8.6788,0.2236,0.0508,1.2858,1.0969,0.0003,5.716,1.7643,3.3799,4.0547,5.5485,5.8495,0.405,9.2291,7.1013,0.0707,1.7061,4.7261,4.5527,3.7546,5.7256,0.0075,1.6258,0.9611,2.3797,1.5625,5.8051,2.595,2.546,0.5051,0.2527,1.3713,5.7045,4.7465,3.8181,3.1836,4.2131,0.0771,3.2068,3.18,7.9406,2.2548,0.5338,3.0279,1.5644,1.5959,0.9882,5.3025,5.6406,3.2576,7.7291,0.7159,4.6916,7.5785,6.8817,4.6669,4.1676,4.1716,1.0688,1.9438,2.8943,2.7732,6.0248,2.2469,2.5162,3.9829,3.9843,2.0295,1.6909,3.1367,3.3584,2.9668,4.6693,1.5517,2.4612,5.9254,8.2036,0.4609,0.0008,1.9451,2.4086,0.1451,0.1086,6.9442,6.7118,7.9679,1.3204,0.8839,10.5805,0.3,1.3948,6.4216,2.0453,2.6534,2.8232,1.1596,0.866,1.8121,0.0039,2.5351,2.7455,0.0957,4.8537,1.4711,1.8778,4.7105,1.0245,5.1399,5.7238,0.4183,0.0028,4.4649,5.7758,1.0876,7.5011,8.3921,6.2314,0.0806,4.2119,6.0331,1.6538,3.9886,8.0161,3.856,0.4343,1.28,6.4639,8.2635,4.2675,0.2549,0.2002,1.9492,7.5536,5.2415,2.9586,4.1872,6.0333,2.8593,0.7389,0.6779,0.3622,4.5253,3.113,1.0152,0.0002,2.3026,4.4207,7.942,4.5685,6.9705,3.9137,3.7442,1.7466,6.1698,1.3984,4.068,1.2858,2.9211,0.0237,1.7766,4.1159,2.1366,0.6894,5.3893,4.8626,0.4478,2.9679,5.0251,3.1033,0.8601,1.6588,4.1087,1.2129,1.2712,2.6314,3.0221,6.3931,1.5113,0.1128,1.4343,5.7965,4.2389,1.5301,5.4663,0.6753,2.3788,4.0549,0.8901,3.8627,1.228,2.6743,5.08,7.9687,1.7192,4.6248,3.8598,0.852,6.354,1.1125,1.8693,1.579,6.0695,0.8475,2.453,1.3085,4.6323,4.0962,7.388,0.7141,0.8668,4.5127,1.8892,7.871,0.1457,4.0698,2.4733,4.0933,3.6859,5.5064,4.175,0.0597,7.2433,8.7748,4.4687,4.2979,1.9247,0.6933,1.6463,0.8539,7.1979,5.1032,6.5471,1.2515,2.2252,1.6153,1.8569,2.8393,0.0565,2.8653,7.4926,0.0273,0.0096,5.2152,4.4469,1.5006,6.3922,0.046,7.1845,9.2225,7.7693,1.2349,4.2585,0.0244,0.7197,5.0162,0.8733,6.3706,4.0507,0.7379,4.073,1.7269,8.9956,2.0458,3.2767,3.473,0.0342,3.5954,3.0664,6.0849,3.2708,4.5874,3.6485,4.0956,0.3127,3.821,3.8529,4.9564,5.0302,6.0863,4.5212,2.0456,8.2564,0.6322,4.4894,0.0043,2.092,3.102,3.4073,0.011,6.0785,2.8657,4.1261,6.7558,4.8058,2.3935]}
{"id":2710,"ended":true,"length":420,"text":"Despite the navigation being closed, a guide to Midhurst published in 1895 advertised that skiffs could be hired, and fishing could be enjoyed. The boats were hired out by a plumber called J. P. Hutton between the months of Easter and the middle of September. The author describes a large fleet of boats moored at the foot of St Michaels Mount including one with eight oars and \"a good gun-wielding skipper \". The boats offered for charter were a \" large barge, a small one, an 18, 20, and 22 hand oared boat and a punt \". The guide makes it clear that there is no \"fishing in the waters around the house. \" There was a special rate of \u00a3 1 per day for the punt and it was a good oar on the barge as it \" could not make very much out of the water \". As the site is now a privately owned house the site of the barge has been obscured, but the boat is clearly shown on the map as being moored on the right hand side of the map. The site of the barge was clearly visible with a modern building obscuring it on the first publication of the guide. The site of the punt can now be identified by the large embankment to the left hand side of the map. The barge is indicated as being moored under a large tree with a ladder leading up to it where skippers were at all times on hand to take out boats and look after customers. The site is now covered by a Victorian building.\n\nIt is believed that the map was originally published by the Midhurst & District Guide, a directory published by the Midhurst & District Herald.\n\n\"Midhurst & District Barge Guide\"\n\" A Guide to the Barge Companies at Midhurst \"\n\" The Guide was issued every year from 1895-1912 under the auspices of the Midhurst & District Guide, a directory published by the Midhurst & District Herald of Midhurst \"\n\"The Barge Guide will be read with interest by all Midhurst residents. It contains a description of the various Barge Companies at Midhurst in 1895 \"\n\"A good list of the Barge companies can be obtained by addressing the Midhurst & District Guide, 1 W.

{"id":2885,"ended":true,"length":438,"text":"Like other groups, the members of this family show patterns in their electron configurations, especially the outermost shells, resulting in trends in chemical behavior. However, lawrencium is an exception, in that its electrons are organized in a different fashion than most other metals. This difference is due to a difference in the nature of the neutron, resulting in a stronger nuclear force ( the strong nuclear interaction ) between adjacent shells of positive charged electrons. This stronger interaction leads to the tendency for outermost shells to repel, thus creating what are, essentially, two shells, rather than a single shell and a double shell configuration and hence an almost equal number of electrons in each electron shell. As a result only one of the innermost electrons is held closely to the nuclei, leaving electrons and nuclei in free space. The strong interaction causes the electrons to repel in other words, to attract a negatively charged nucleus with their positive charges away from each other in the outermost positions.\n\nThis attractive force is strong and is mediated in most atomic nuclei by the shared quark and gluon fields that also bind the nucleons that make up the nuclei. As a result, the first few nucleons closest to and surrounded by the electrons repel away from the nearest innermost electron. Over time this attracts the innermost electron, allowing for the further attraction as outermost positions get closer to the innermost shell electrons. If the interaction between these shells were weak, electrons would fall into the innermost shell as other shells become progressively more energetic and more highly charged. Thus for many of the other metals, electrons are expected to fall into outermost positions and therefore the shells appear to form a smooth continuum. With the strong interaction, however, the repulsion of the outer shell electrons, causes the inner shell electrons to cluster together in decreasing size and number in decreasing order of energy. The first shell electrons are the largest and are therefore the most numerous. As the electrons fall, each cluster of electrons becomes smaller and smaller, with the outermost shells being the smallest. Eventually, a particle is present that is neither positively charged nor negatively charged, but is located in outer space.\n\nIn the next post, we will return to the matter\/antimatter problem and show what happens when the amount of matter vs antimatter in the universe is equal.","token_len":473,"entropy":[6.0238,6.093,0.6382,2.0122,6.738,0.6651,2.6023,5.0419,6.6907,8.8183,2.7416,1.7428,13.1722,7.9757,1.6954,4.7412,2.578,6.3197,1.6597,8.3472,2.0111,6.2598,0.1469,9.2902,1.3405,5.7844,4.1187,0.9865,4.1516,0.0243,11.5826,7.2832,6.2744,2.6758,3.4301,3.0316,1.4681,3.879,0.2449,2.6189,3.8877,0.9345,5.6356,1.0238,1.1609,4.6871,4.1579,1.5,4.4101,0.8804,4.0645,0.7458,2.8314,4.1463,1.7161,2.1119,0.1638,2.4484,3.4638,0.0855,0.7794,3.8913,0.0472,0.7535,8.585,2.9222,5.976,0.1568,1.6805,5.6877,4.7283,1.8744,3.6208,9.7869,4.597,1.6182,7.1174,2.7348,3.0668,6.9517,3.6519,3.9977,9.4361,4.0319,2.5919,0.5408,2.1508,5.1997,2.9081,3.1946,0.0374,1.5601,5.5046,0.8864,7.1622,2.5246,0.3732,0.3435,6.7557,0.1433,4.4579,3.6591,3.2707,6.5345,2.8374,6.1562,3.3097,0.0611,3.0615,4.2648,2.2832,5.0158,0.0106,1.9471,0.6998,0.6684,4.9819,1.5439,5.0015,0.3856,8.3555,6.5145,4.0281,3.0703,5.7279,5.362,1.4707,0.0063,2.0513,1.7637,1.6314,4.4009,2.8662,0.2389,4.066,1.0328,0.2518,9.5135,1.8662,2.0886,0.6586,4.4317,0.3012,4.9125,1.1338,5.5857,10.084,1.863,0.4642,7.134,0.2353,1.6669,4.7168,4.7145,4.6041,2.1536,0.0235,2.3275,5.2845,1.3519,0.8944,2.0192,6.0399,2.9559,3.7811,1.0892,2.4267,0.3894,1.8295,0.0024,3.6311,5.0683,7.8972,0.7373,1.692,4.8926,4.4572,5.8858,0.0203,1.314,3.9735,3.954,4.8239,1.8129,7.0422,0.1544,2.4309,0.0198,3.6457,1.7541,4.1047,0.4045,8.9733,0.8161,2.1242,0.0387,2.9921,7.8686,4.8602,1.6107,5.9642,4.1959,2.7804,6.729,3.8405,5.4216,4.6867,2.0701,0.005,1.5987,0.9102,9.1799,7.6603,1.0701,3.7263,8.0587,0.0357,0.1188,6.241,2.6965,5.186,5.6249,1.69,2.5132,5.9212,4.9601,2.9125,0.0124,0.5113,2.8102,0.2232,0.5159,3.422,1.1376,0.2105,0.4244,1.2067,6.7952,4.0954,1.5892,0.7587,7.738,0.0395,5.7984,5.861,0.024,1.0801,4.5416,5.3401,0.0357,6.8745,0.6243,0.9724,6.5007,5.8177,0.0445,2.8313,1.4872,5.9159,0.2139,2.6484,4.0888,1.0342,4.423,0.0012,1.5477,2.0063,4.6553,3.3007,1.2609,6.491,2.9756,6.1392,8.2061,0.0778,7.7636,3.4743,0.4762,0.6321,0.6408,2.7108,0.0022,3.8696,5.5995,0.467,4.8661,0.9075,6.2345,1.423,2.9614,5.2889,3.6557,3.8839,0.8872,4.2889,0.5465,6.6777,1.9311,1.0774,2.8549,0.0078,0.944,3.4537,6.2672,0.7413,3.5347,6.9547,1.9739,4.1453,1.6317,3.0582,5.2379,0.5817,0.4641,3.5295,5.5011,3.4099,2.7504,0.408,4.3422,4.7751,0.6451,4.0169,1.3856,5.9257,0.0148,3.7701,0.3944,4.7088,0.112,1.1727,2.4134,4.0743,2.9723,6.0036,5.8201,0.6881,4.7063,2.2447,9.0801,5.9217,1.1466,5.8543,1.5379,3.6805,0.6926,0.9296,3.0653,0.0132,1.2244,8.3553,1.6577,1.969,1.4819,1.2558,7.208,0.9505,3.96,7.1281,0.9511,2.1656,5.8875,0.5165,0.087,7.5481,1.3565,1.9632,8.463,5.7596,1.3916,6.6287,4.2497,5.3131,1.8762,1.5867,4.8614,1.1026,2.1533,5.5219,2.6043,1.3893,1.6264,4.2692,4.4193,1.1898,2.7754,3.8309,1.5994,0.7007,5.3299,1.0218,3.1448,1.5096,2.8639,4.5522,4.006,5.0917,9.7493,0.9847,1.1456,3.3148,2.0367,0.5002,0.4897,1.3873,3.3474,1.1202,3.9915,0.0987,2.259,3.1154,2.0378,1.2138,1.4154,3.5896,0.7848,3.6223,6.3733,3.154,7.132,2.1771,1.0484,7.2082,4.4323,0.0505,0.0723,0.1275,0.0108,0.9391,1.864,1.7827,5.5339,1.2411,6.2678,4.5341,1.1398,1.9827,0.0001,2.7124,1.6551,3.3907,4.356,0.8771,0.3817,0.4518,6.4533,0.0389,0.7188,5.5021,6.3699,3.1832,0.7561,0.0035,3.9218,1.6138,4.302,4.2335,1.9457,0.3884,1.4209,7.0039,0.0386,2.3572,7.1549,3.1363,0.0004,2.6608,1.0547,1.818,0.4562,3.5702,1.189]}

{"id":4320,"ended":true,"length":439,"text":"Black mambas breed annually and mating occurs in the early spring, when male mambas locate a female by following her scent trail. After finding a potential mate the male will inspect the female by licking her on the nose and neck areas. Once he has discovered that she is able, the female initiates the first contact while approaching the male. The male will approach, lick the female on the mouth and face areas, and she will do the same. The male begins mounting and the female initiates mating, thus beginning the pairing process.\n\nOnce this has occurred a pair will hold each other tightly to the body, and mate for 3 - 5 minutes. During this time the female will give the male semen by copulatory emission from the vagina. The mated pair will then spend more time grooming each other as to establish a bond between the two mating parts. Once the pair is bonded, the pair will separate a few minutes to regurgitate the semen which has been stored in the male's penis and then will return to the nest to mate again. The mating process repeats until the mating season has ended.\n\nThe breeding cycle of the black mamba can be seen in Figure 3. The first mating and pair bond occurs in February and mating continues until May.\n\nPairs may produce one or two offspring. Male African mambas will begin to breed more early in the year, after the female mamba initiates mating, although this increases to a higher rate once she has mated with other males. The second mating occurs after the female has mated only once, although this second mating does not always happen.\n\nThe gestation period is 25 - 27 days after mating. The first few days after birth the young are without eyes or hair, and are very weak. After this the young mamba begins eating and by 3 weeks the young are completely weaned to consume the mother's milk until it reaches adulthood around 35 days.\n\nBlack mambas are excellent swimmers and hunt mostly by sight although they are strong swimmers. They have excellent night vision along with excellent hearing. Their tail consists of a modified dorsal spine and lower body spine that aid in the animal's control of its body movements. Also, they have a small dorsal notch on the back of the neck that can be used to capture smaller vertebrates.","token_len":474,"entropy":[8.0124,7.4164,1.9653,10.5406,9.4799,3.1891,8.1641,2.6943,1.5161,2.1473,3.5001,1.4266,2.1603,2.7259,6.0295,0.5293,0.9234,0.0126,8.1136,2.3005,1.6038,4.3523,5.1671,0.6701,1.8058,2.756,1.0112,4.5233,6.1182,1.3047,7.0545,0.2958,4.7808,1.9149,2.0546,7.4534,1.0081,1.2498,4.0222,4.9827,0.7429,5.7232,0.5089,2.5849,0.9696,4.8497,5.786,1.1875,2.74,2.2635,0.8358,4.6625,2.8115,1.1005,0.5117,6.5191,6.5968,1.9141,2.0829,7.8456,0.0017,2.1064,3.8902,5.0915,6.9797,6.4068,0.9016,1.7604,1.0444,1.6113,1.4719,1.4044,4.5302,3.8228,2.8789,2.0406,0.9838,3.2802,0.4191,4.0871,1.0677,3.8897,1.0804,0.8914,0.8213,4.9652,0.2919,6.0601,0.9593,0.0496,1.5941,1.6318,1.4834,5.0875,9.5551,2.7335,4.2727,0.68,4.6864,0.0005,3.0504,2.877,5.181,3.7797,0.5338,6.4161,1.8809,0.5532,1.2855,0.0011,3.9119,4.965,3.1125,1.7248,4.1252,3.8407,1.8883,7.602,1.6275,0.0146,4.0467,4.255,1.4374,2.8425,2.4144,1.7405,6.2534,2.3919,5.7329,5.27,1.1862,1.1396,0.7274,3.0534,0.5329,0.3117,0.5698,1.7635,0.521,4.7079,2.4651,0.1985,8.483,5.5409,6.5201,4.4285,6.9728,4.742,0.9937,4.3718,1.5733,1.3232,6.028,2.097,1.9446,0.529,1.088,4.3845,4.8294,0.1127,4.3055,1.5508,0.0126,3.4402,5.1634,5.5082,1.36,2.6125,2.2111,1.1802,0.7397,6.1645,5.7986,0.2963,2.5248,0.7,3.7614,1.8389,3.2947,1.3947,0.6455,3.9267,0.4407,6.0563,6.8124,1.0235,2.4745,6.0281,7.2599,2.0919,0.0254,0.9181,1.0317,4.3934,2.5306,0.5653,3.7793,0.8427,0.5145,3.0194,0.4497,4.4606,2.7102,3.3173,3.491,2.8163,0.3275,0.8744,5.0907,2.2262,2.3905,1.1267,0.3741,2.0568,2.9859,1.2074,4.954,1.4292,0.6351,2.9865,3.9164,1.8088,1.4079,0.3983,0.5067,0.0002,2.3265,4.8374,3.8139,1.4666,2.1891,6.1705,0.0567,1.02,3.0007,0.7358,3.2114,0.6078,2.3223,2.2246,0.5328,1.2429,3.4762,2.93,4.9912,6.9111,5.3141,2.1733,1.8268,3.22,1.5061,8.309,5.9572,0.9311,2.5037,0.6376,2.4563,0.0003,5.0814,5.3652,4.3775,6.4596,4.0502,1.035,1.7299,1.4043,2.2784,5.7401,5.4862,0.7307,0.827,0.012,2.8154,5.3589,1.4992,1.7604,4.8805,8.3893,0.5848,0.5658,1.9479,1.5467,4.2675,2.8441,2.8445,4.8247,3.2796,7.3352,0.0006,2.0483,2.2673,4.3115,2.1176,8.3974,3.3799,2.3082,3.9598,2.4629,3.5818,1.5012,1.0207,6.5104,0.0067,1.0282,3.7462,1.0342,0.2641,1.7406,4.3133,1.1718,1.5464,3.6256,0.7961,2.651,1.4531,1.2567,0.0088,7.5241,1.804,1.6971,3.9466,1.3955,6.7126,0.3413,3.0683,0.2878,5.0301,3.4699,0.8861,1.2768,0.0002,1.8949,6.4804,0.3551,2.4345,6.2562,1.0981,4.6917,0.3483,4.6945,2.6706,0.6169,1.2593,3.0315,5.607,1.5576,1.4978,4.0337,1.2968,3.3284,1.3997,8.4593,5.054,1.8065,2.7377,1.2579,0.9627,2.8755,4.3065,4.6571,1.1681,2.9375,1.9753,2.7407,1.5861,7.2031,1.6433,3.4588,6.5362,1.7958,6.8631,4.9678,2.1112,2.3825,1.9659,0.9106,2.942,9.6121,0.0025,4.4498,7.6616,2.0577,3.3209,0.3328,1.3439,6.7938,3.7312,1.8241,3.9317,9.2185,5.1873,1.3676,1.1158,1.3049,0.0002,3.9731,0.0788,0.4485,0.0013,1.3522,6.2772,6.3675,0.0053,0.9752,6.0798,6.4831,3.332,5.4965,8.0462,0.9231,1.6653,6.4816,2.3788,0.0001,1.3765,1.3115,2.935,3.177,7.0736,0.0818,6.4607,0.1183,1.6699,2.5563,0.6894,3.1086,5.8101,5.5433,0.0839,0.9967,7.755,5.4265,7.6425,1.696,7.0247,2.4921,8.6543,2.3297,7.9887,0.2965,3.2171,6.0266,0.2882,5.387,0.7652,2.1323,2.6286,2.9602,0.3411,6.7644,0.996,1.7792,0.8984,1.4041,3.7827,4.0052,7.2982,1.6294,0.7554,1.9483,0.969,1.2416,2.2992,1.0103,3.511,0.5712,0.6868,0.6187,5.6657,7.1005,6.4232,1.5374,1.1702]}

{"id":2578,"ended":true,"length":416,"text":"The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. H\u00e4kkinen said that he was `` pleased `` to win the race and admitted that he had been `` on the limit ``.\n\nIn Canada a month ago, Prost, the world champion, had won the pole position and pole was also on offer here, with Villeneuve and Schumacher ahead of him on the grid. On the opening lap Villeneuve lost the lead to Prost and retired from the race with a power unit failure. Schumacher overtook Prost on lap five and kept him at bay for the remaining 49 laps to win. Schumacher said `` the win is ours `` but team manager Norbert Haug said it was `` more significant as a result `` to see Prost `` come back from his engine failure to take third place ``.\n\nSchumacher`s teammate Rubens Barrichello had qualified in eighth place but gained two positions at the start when both Schumacher and Prost were delayed by lapped cars. He was promoted to fifth place shortly before the retirement of Villeneuve, who had suffered his oil pressure switch malfunction and failed to stop his Ferrari. Barrichello took second place and Villeneuve took third. It is the first grand prix since 1992 where two different models of Ferrari have been on the podium.\n\nFor the final podium place at Monaco Jarno Trulli outran a slowing Ralf Schumacher to cross the line almost six seconds behind Schumacher. Trulli`s victory lifts him up to fourth in the drivers` championship with 76 points and the Monegasque driver also moved ahead in the constructors` championship to third with 136, just two points behind McLaren.\n\nThere had been a touch of controversy before the race with some drivers claiming that the qualifying times had been written in the wrong format. On Saturday night, the official website said that times would be written from left to right, which was then changed to right to left on Sunday afternoon. The website then claimed that the Times newspaper had confirmed that the format would be altered in the next 24 hours to be more accurate. It is not known where the Times got the information and it was reported that the times would still be written from left to right.","token_len":475,"entropy":[6.6897,2.7575,6.187,8.8973,2.3437,0.9005,4.4194,3.7003,7.3723,1.9815,5.0158,2.926,5.5458,3.1471,5.7988,3.8426,0.0552,5.0072,7.7494,4.1102,2.1101,0.1497,0.0001,2.7619,1.8488,1.3889,1.7991,12.0429,11.044,6.816,1.171,2.013,0.9,4.4649,1.9663,8.0408,0.418,0.6395,1.7156,2.1483,4.4304,5.6089,0.9222,7.8598,4.1671,5.2053,1.5514,0.0675,3.3483,8.5741,5.4084,5.6425,1.0886,0.5893,8.1575,1.212,3.0752,2.3315,4.0495,1.6343,0.6567,3.3131,2.4417,0.6887,4.9934,0.813,2.503,4.0411,9.1647,5.0875,3.7358,5.2217,6.7759,2.594,2.919,9.766,1.4866,0.0005,2.1993,4.845,0.5313,0.0009,5.1515,0.6455,0.8882,3.8798,0.4975,1.8448,0.3155,4.7689,1.1826,5.1052,0.8442,3.6038,0.0042,0.0001,4.4414,1.7914,1.5311,2.0076,5.8067,0.0042,1.6291,6.982,2.1134,0.2877,0.4536,2.9414,1.0861,6.871,1.2806,1.8925,0.591,2.8636,0.0028,0.0038,7.6411,0.0013,3.989,0.0016,2.251,2.1937,4.4164,1.0853,5.2877,3.1658,2.5449,4.1228,1.8579,1.2985,3.9858,8.7162,0.2692,3.5158,3.4282,2.7416,3.9156,0.0067,0.0049,4.1188,5.8681,3.2787,4.8759,1.9645,7.0514,2.1822,3.5012,9.3497,2.0077,7.4383,0.017,1.5899,6.0407,2.2113,3.1545,0.5395,2.6447,4.7608,5.2903,4.9883,1.6672,0.5881,3.8477,3.7594,4.0343,3.7412,0.0069,6.5032,3.9765,1.4316,1.96,2.2786,7.0063,0.2665,1.9441,3.1076,4.3667,0.7199,9.1327,0.8287,0.6791,0.0003,3.7853,0.0281,0.0049,7.6856,0.0275,4.6424,8.2561,0.129,0.3721,0.0069,0.0001,3.3177,6.3792,2.6006,4.8901,0.7131,2.8758,7.6556,3.8115,5.2049,4.1017,0.3162,2.6496,5.2103,6.361,4.0618,0.0108,0.0251,0.1009,4.6132,0.0043,1.7224,6.8257,1.3684,8.75,5.8012,3.4907,0.7048,3.5131,1.9654,6.2783,0.3281,2.5658,1.092,6.1147,2.1016,0.3938,9.4272,1.2822,2.104,0.0057,0.0,2.1038,1.0308,1.3562,5.0865,4.4153,10.5768,4.4255,10.9382,4.9301,2.0149,4.1913,0.4654,4.0867,2.3784,4.4945,1.8045,3.5728,0.0072,0.005,4.1471,1.8952,0.6615,1.8695,4.7179,0.0053,0.0001,1.9693,0.7935,0.5847,4.9012,2.5951,2.7646,1.1471,7.2127,0.0257,0.0001,3.0288,4.1053,2.513,3.1684,4.6468,7.6289,1.4493,3.3674,2.0625,1.4859,4.7833,0.3961,1.5119,1.2101,0.6012,0.0004,4.6354,1.4055,4.1449,3.6101,3.8627,4.1833,4.5705,7.5381,4.9288,0.2805,1.2229,0.1714,8.0641,6.6727,4.4287,9.9977,5.2643,3.2638,1.3552,0.2689,0.0084,3.0783,8.8051,0.2378,0.373,7.2133,4.3673,0.4838,1.8065,2.353,0.0079,0.0061,1.1557,7.9575,0.0003,4.7961,0.0135,4.7942,9.1174,2.1171,3.1079,0.7139,2.256,2.8578,0.2874,4.1209,2.314,2.8211,2.4917,8.7611,0.4528,2.4196,2.9632,8.0122,7.6206,2.0003,6.7707,4.2713,3.9269,6.1109,4.1046,3.1254,0.6055,4.5641,0.003,0.5277,0.7714,3.1591,3.6153,1.5991,7.6908,5.8382,5.0476,3.3347,0.6336,0.6579,7.1521,1.0917,0.7898,0.0003,5.4459,4.0731,0.0993,2.1117,8.3479,0.2157,2.9349,4.1843,0.679,0.9186,2.9732,2.6754,2.5744,2.3472,0.6846,1.7557,6.3262,4.2656,2.3773,0.6081,7.5914,3.2465,2.281,3.9802,3.6494,1.0695,4.5154,3.1613,3.605,2.0842,2.366,4.606,3.6622,3.1326,0.8342,9.4408,3.4213,0.439,3.297,4.7504,6.8635,0.1276,0.0035,1.607,3.9802,1.6054,5.0081,1.488,0.448,2.2911,0.3109,3.2893,4.1937,0.8896,3.3035,0.4304,2.0866,3.1156,2.7303,4.3452,0.2758,1.3615,7.2072,5.8118,1.0136,7.355,1.2068,1.1484,5.1023,3.2717,0.5526,3.2235,2.9975,0.8964,2.0954,3.831,0.0218,2.2252,3.8577,2.0073,2.3444,0.5641,3.9898,2.2467,1.4448,1.6598,4.1807,0.7414,3.6571,5.1682,0.8104,0.9613,3.0465,2.1669,1.4346,3.5317,1.0028,1.1798,5.9609,1.7199,4.4613,0.2185,2.0606,2.3548,0.5572,0.0186,0.0058,0.9158]}
{"id":3645,"ended":true,"length":408,"text":"Ashdod is located on the historic Via Maris. Highway 4 was developed following this route along the southern sea shore of Israel ; it serves as the main connection to the north, towards the Dead Sea and the Negev Desert. Ashdod is home to an inter-city bus station (the 4th largest in Israel), an international airport, a railway station, and an extensive bus network.Ashdod is known throughout Israel for the annual Israel National Touring Theatre Festival.\n\nIn 1948, the town of Ashdod suffered one of the harshest Israeli-Palestinian uprisings and pogroms of the first intifada, as a result of which many houses in the north part of the city were destroyed by the Palestinian guerrillas. In 1994, as a result of Operation Cast Lead, Israel destroyed all buildings within 50 m of the Gaza Strip border fence with Israel. After the end of the operation, Ashkelon municipality established a number of houses in the area that were in danger areas, and built fences there.\n\nSince 2002, Ashdod has been known as \"the start of the beach\" because of the large number of beach side housing, some of it dating from the Ottoman and British periods, and being located near the Ashdod Port where cruise ships depart. The port was created in 1957 in order to make transportation between the Sinai and the port more convenient. The Port of Ashdod is also close to the Ashkelon port, which is known as \u201cIsrael\u2019s Gateway to Europe\u201d, which in turn is linked closely to the Mediterranean.\n\nAshdod (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05e9\u05db\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4\u200e, meaning 'peace') is a city and metropolitan area in southern Israel with more than 100,000 inhabitants and a growing tourism industry. The city is considered a suburb of metropolitan Tel Aviv. Israel's second biggest port, about 20km (12mi) south of Tel Aviv, is located on the Mediterranean sea at the end of a large, sandy peninsula along the coastline called the \"Ashkelon Bay\". It is about 100 km (62mi) north of the border between Israel and Gaza. It is an important base for the Israeli navy, and is the most populous municipality in the pre-state Jewish Agency for Palestine.","token_len":475,"entropy":[6.6327,4.7922,3.8577,5.8937,2.092,0.6995,9.361,8.5981,4.916,5.4981,3.4791,10.7272,4.1499,4.0742,5.5259,5.2512,5.7077,3.6979,4.9513,0.6678,4.4788,8.5002,2.7109,1.1261,7.1965,10.642,2.0662,5.5129,0.2587,1.1583,1.9156,5.7342,1.5443,0.6371,4.9427,3.4307,7.1511,0.5922,7.006,0.0011,1.4994,1.3746,5.548,0.005,0.0007,3.7341,0.4624,9.1275,0.0231,0.0004,0.9888,4.672,0.0101,3.8165,6.0881,1.2339,3.7718,3.4667,2.7138,3.3292,3.3516,6.9491,0.7746,4.9754,1.0142,1.0937,1.6568,2.3536,3.3997,0.8818,0.9734,1.1584,3.8997,0.4363,0.6862,1.6337,2.087,4.3355,5.2568,1.5331,0.5597,8.3419,0.0158,0.0009,0.8841,4.0549,4.8396,1.074,1.1903,2.7453,7.1685,5.7963,5.037,5.394,5.0866,7.98,2.8106,1.5349,3.3831,0.005,4.0595,3.4477,0.4782,1.4023,4.9212,0.4572,0.1353,0.0227,0.002,5.6276,4.024,0.0201,0.2143,6.2939,0.0007,6.0323,4.116,0.7578,10.6941,0.0033,0.0,4.0117,9.5337,0.0685,0.0,0.0075,1.0906,0.8996,5.1686,6.6545,0.0014,0.0178,2.1171,3.4968,2.9148,1.9166,0.013,1.9671,3.3978,6.3029,3.4892,0.486,6.7643,7.1301,0.0202,0.3254,1.3021,0.2207,1.0761,2.5211,1.6296,4.2181,6.0544,0.3656,0.0001,0.3618,2.29,5.6454,0.2175,4.616,1.946,0.3402,0.03,6.8872,0.9761,0.0014,0.3058,2.5716,4.9769,4.1953,4.5642,4.0159,4.8426,2.8013,0.4597,0.7674,5.4995,0.7761,4.3863,3.9419,4.5804,1.4553,0.8735,4.5578,1.1632,4.0253,0.003,0.5273,6.0311,0.4465,2.0869,9.8493,0.0002,6.4496,5.2309,0.906,5.9186,0.0011,5.3707,1.7309,0.8663,2.7488,3.1108,1.0344,5.0684,4.044,10.5835,1.9586,1.8618,4.5739,6.3104,5.4886,1.0855,1.3375,0.0002,3.9168,4.8041,0.1622,2.0238,0.9288,0.0016,0.2916,0.8462,4.3026,0.734,2.3356,1.2426,7.9837,0.2194,0.9132,8.8412,2.3543,3.9856,0.3392,1.0183,3.1168,0.9431,0.0036,2.8378,8.1039,6.5772,3.2358,5.0017,0.687,4.0315,7.2008,1.4944,0.4458,7.353,4.1449,4.3916,2.3319,1.6088,1.0524,6.0362,2.8092,3.044,0.4506,5.1177,0.9856,0.0074,6.8454,5.6112,9.9247,0.1551,5.5477,2.447,2.1367,4.9671,2.3325,5.1508,1.2405,5.0178,3.1206,1.051,0.0189,4.0673,5.0726,2.2986,1.0658,8.2002,1.0296,1.3158,5.0794,2.1733,0.897,0.8002,1.8895,4.703,1.3326,0.5099,0.0694,0.0039,1.3774,2.7321,5.9284,0.026,0.3946,4.6211,2.7053,0.0375,3.1557,1.1657,1.5115,1.0532,3.2291,0.693,13.0905,6.2456,4.851,5.5739,7.4298,5.2537,7.9758,2.3449,3.8668,0.3678,6.1406,2.6809,1.8893,4.7199,0.3116,1.3748,4.8946,7.3763,0.4813,0.2999,4.582,1.3484,0.7193,0.0002,3.9758,0.0615,0.0017,5.0685,7.957,0.6366,0.205,0.2694,1.6564,3.9773,2.0731,3.1118,1.9362,1.7926,2.3459,3.7417,2.6709,1.8312,5.0338,2.7934,6.5543,2.8408,0.5539,1.6059,2.5905,4.1613,7.11,0.4013,1.4297,3.085,0.0657,3.5508,3.9674,0.0266,2.8909,0.495,0.0037,0.4622,2.7197,1.9504,7.0634,4.3777,0.2937,0.3051,1.8138,1.5912,1.0039,4.3804,2.0981,8.9489,0.5177,9.3764,2.5922,0.0179,1.5554,5.3182,1.7181,4.1443,3.9301,5.3821,1.3187,8.1379,3.281,3.1948,2.6577,1.8058,7.2004,0.0153,1.8024,0.3836,2.3591,0.0326,0.2332,0.616,1.5149,1.5787,0.24,3.236,4.4311,4.8436,0.4422,3.2487,0.0036,2.3838,3.6852,2.8244,2.944,4.3242,5.2484,0.1725,3.9106,5.2339,1.159,4.364,5.1527,0.8467,0.0798,2.5765,0.9005,2.4716,0.5486,5.2632,3.1495,1.611,0.2329,3.3072,1.0026,0.0051,2.1875,0.409,1.2276,2.8224,2.4676,0.4856,0.0293,2.8514,0.5363,2.7861,0.4932,4.0382,0.8982,6.1536,0.659,1.6508,2.6787,3.0689,1.1885,1.7629,1.581,2.3199,3.2737,3.5924,5.3368,0.3171,0.7139,7.9526,0.2012,6.1961,4.2057,6.5317,5.1641,2.56,1.4302]}
{"id":1840,"ended":true,"length":456,"text":"When Ceres has an opposition near the perihelion, it can reach a visual magnitude of + 6 @. @ 7. This is generally regarded as too dim to be seen with the unaided eye. As it is a dwarf, it can be easily seen in binoculars and large telescopes, usually on or approaching opposition. This means that its apparent size is largest when it is closest to the Earth (i.e. opposition). Because of its low mass and proximity to the sun, the effect of the Sun's light on the surface of Ceres will be less than on a planet like Earth and Mars. In fact, it is possible to imagine Ceres as two separate celestial objects: the dwarf planet (i.e. the surface of the object) and the faint star (i.e. the surface illuminated by the Sun). A very large telescope may be needed to resolve them. Most amateur astronomers won't be able to detect the dwarf planet, but even at its brightest the faint star will appear to be very red, indicating a large quantity of water ice (but not any other substance). Because Ceres is so close, the star is quite small and thus has a very short period of rotation. As a result, the light from it appears to pulsate as it sweeps past the eye. The effect is similar to the flickers of a strobe light. During an opposition, the star will pass in front of the planet, giving the appearance of a disk of light. To a naked eye observer who is seeing this phenomenon, Ceres will appear to rotate on its axis rather than in a more circular orbit. This will make the appearance that the dwarf planet seems to move along an ellipse. The Earth will appear to be revolving around the star, and the view will seem to be upside down (counterclockwise) from our perspective. Astronomers have discovered some minor moons orbiting Ceres. These have been given names but are not yet confirmed. It has been stated that there is a faint dwarf planet with an orbital period of about 10 hours. According to a recent paper, Ceres could be the source of water in the asteroid belt. It is theorized that the original formation of the solar system was more chaotic than previously thought, with asteroids getting closer to the sun through impacts. This new theory suggests that asteroids like Ceres actually have multiple orbits.","token_len":475,"entropy":[13.651,3.7353,4.9032,8.9967,8.5232,1.3419,8.6684,1.5356,0.0256,0.0006,0.5486,1.3408,2.5099,4.7197,2.4708,9.8177,5.5364,0.4634,5.7036,8.8438,9.9475,7.1335,6.6766,6.0588,1.1265,5.0208,1.1707,7.561,3.793,0.1439,5.9446,8.222,1.4545,1.1204,1.6606,3.2146,1.3594,8.4123,2.3884,0.0033,0.1574,0.8052,4.7465,2.9648,1.1165,2.8146,5.8895,3.7638,0.9626,2.2541,1.3542,3.5182,1.1751,2.4749,7.4273,0.0011,0.2195,2.3377,6.9666,0.6252,2.2399,7.4033,3.0151,5.9401,9.4812,11.8772,0.8701,3.3686,3.5214,0.3849,3.7736,3.7653,1.6399,0.8645,9.4307,2.2224,1.4987,0.4801,5.22,0.1238,0.8151,4.2151,3.1048,4.0898,0.0012,0.0006,0.7919,10.4701,1.6854,5.5138,1.2157,1.0159,3.894,2.6387,2.019,5.3947,0.0986,0.3923,2.2609,0.2144,2.4328,5.3084,0.7656,1.8137,3.6178,1.015,2.8308,1.385,2.3069,4.0894,0.5336,0.1938,3.85,0.7864,3.0033,1.6799,5.3275,3.0091,3.4921,3.6145,1.7022,3.9394,4.4748,0.5168,3.7923,1.8644,0.1002,2.1012,1.1659,3.0082,0.7027,5.748,1.3137,1.125,6.2149,2.5874,4.9162,3.5329,4.3332,2.4109,4.3243,0.338,4.1469,4.7018,0.0023,0.0005,0.0577,2.5657,5.0021,0.4213,1.0479,7.2166,1.0308,0.3006,0.3628,7.0746,2.9917,0.8316,0.5418,0.0007,0.0023,0.0044,0.7209,4.2518,9.5116,0.1461,0.4981,0.771,0.3751,4.6613,4.5884,2.4155,4.5208,3.5918,0.8494,2.2507,0.2646,5.2334,6.2977,0.9128,6.1027,6.4594,0.1298,6.8277,0.0005,1.2094,0.2031,0.0047,3.8729,1.5153,3.1908,0.4542,2.4493,0.9424,4.2899,4.4099,3.4141,3.5052,3.156,3.133,0.1828,1.3112,3.375,1.3727,0.5965,3.3008,7.0529,2.1508,3.5837,1.9317,4.0476,5.8864,0.0111,3.5293,4.4375,3.4551,5.8666,0.9744,4.6979,3.9212,3.7596,0.9744,5.2854,2.0576,0.5386,1.612,2.1161,2.8226,1.9391,4.1037,2.3757,4.2435,3.1469,1.671,4.3529,3.7569,1.5403,1.6472,3.6712,4.0841,0.1601,5.5607,0.8617,3.4383,1.6096,0.3003,0.3493,1.2336,3.5273,1.6108,3.9541,4.9296,0.5436,9.1601,0.0042,3.547,1.7879,6.212,3.5809,0.8359,7.1922,0.9226,1.9263,4.396,1.21,2.5064,0.2193,1.3412,7.3412,3.1876,1.0594,1.0171,4.6681,0.0476,0.5263,1.8356,6.0223,3.9655,5.4913,0.7922,0.8272,2.1559,1.7862,5.3398,3.374,0.961,0.0324,0.4431,3.5339,1.4409,4.6364,1.6187,2.5053,0.1096,0.9013,6.0294,1.2078,1.4975,1.3346,5.3219,5.0283,3.0816,0.0324,8.8795,5.6564,1.3722,4.7465,3.2361,3.9033,0.6496,2.8639,2.8666,0.6872,0.9848,4.7641,4.1602,0.5102,0.4506,4.3536,0.116,2.9928,1.1922,6.3594,2.1728,2.2534,0.3753,1.7957,3.4818,2.2509,1.0262,3.7006,4.4307,1.0896,2.8767,0.0875,7.0223,0.3462,2.5881,3.2797,4.073,2.6102,0.0085,0.3967,1.5504,1.8524,5.1725,3.2713,2.4587,0.4671,1.1159,6.7763,1.4907,0.6675,1.8832,1.4124,2.2387,1.2239,7.0735,0.9674,3.9305,0.7393,0.796,8.3948,0.1317,3.1035,8.8382,1.1446,0.0,1.5404,3.4697,6.4047,1.98,0.2182,6.0753,0.0863,1.8192,3.8445,4.2653,5.4564,5.84,2.1202,1.739,1.345,1.9127,3.4655,0.9154,7.0226,1.547,6.1711,1.9502,1.041,2.5974,3.315,0.6686,3.7779,2.765,0.3965,5.251,0.273,2.9015,1.5656,0.8655,3.952,4.4638,0.2098,3.4834,2.5756,2.4144,0.3801,0.3098,1.9126,3.2613,3.777,0.9346,5.5151,0.0016,3.2753,2.5271,1.8296,1.6699,3.8116,3.4305,0.7257,2.646,5.7097,0.0447,4.4074,3.9391,0.6224,3.5441,0.1024,0.7252,2.6314,0.914,4.8618,0.0669,0.0673,1.4961,7.8339,5.1551,0.2098,1.014,4.8337,0.0356,1.6816,4.9908,5.2244,0.5817,3.6603,0.3413,1.8698,2.9884,5.4727,5.2027,4.7772,0.6803,0.4697,0.84,6.1774,7.3811,1.6894,2.5024,5.1921,2.1654,2.6859,0.1772,4.7845,5.6267,0.4505,5.8325,3.0293,6.5843,3.7918,1.6084]}

{"id":3818,"ended":false,"length":419,"text":"The main cuts to Greed were the elimination of its two sub @ - @ plots and other entire sequences, while individual scenes were often not touched. Commenting about the cuts made in the film, critic Peter Cowie stated \"The removal of a few minutes here and there, the cutting of scenes, and the reshuffling of sequence of events are not, of course, as disturbing as the loss of a character, but I did think the scenes lost were important not only as historical drama but for their entertainment value. \" Greed was originally planned to be a three-part film, but because of the unexpected poor box-office returns due to the high production costs, it only got two parts due to financial constraints.\n\nThe editing was handled by David Hemmings and Andrew Halliday ; as to why it took so long to be released on DVD, it might be due to the copyright issue regarding the film's title.\n\nGreed has never been released on VHS (despite being available in most areas as both a B side and a standalone title available in Blockbusters and other video stores), but it was issued on VCD by British company Universal Studios (also known as \"Hodder & Stoughton Limited\") in the United Kingdom as a two-disc special release in September 2003. The title is listed as \"Greed: A History of the World in Four Megabytes \", and it contains a 25-minute documentary detailing the making of the film. In February 2005, Universal released a four-disc boxset containing Greed, its two sequels (Fantasy Island and High Risk Offshore Racing ) and both seasons of the TV series starring Patrick Mower.\n\nThere were also two other releases of Greed: a UK VHS by the British DVD retailer TV Heaven in 2005 (listed as 'Greed: The Complete Story ) which contained the 25-minute documentary as well as the first season of the sitcom.

{"id":3873,"ended":true,"length":398,"text":"The trailer for Ratatouille debuted with the release of its immediate predecessor, Cars. It depicts an original scene where Remy is caught on the cheese trolley in the restaurant's dining area sampling different kinds of cheese. As Remy is quickly apprehended, he screams that he just \"tasted the cheese!\".\n\nThe final boss is a rat who uses his tail to attack. He is only seen in the opening cutscene of the film, and the background music is the main theme from the game.[1]\n\nIn the UK, the Ratatouille trailer was played in-between previews for The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.\n\nFor the U.K. DVD, the trailer is only present as an extra and was replaced by a bonus short film. This short film, 'The Rat in the Machine', is a compilation of several scenes of Remy's development during the film.\n\nAccording to Disney executive Brad Copeland, the song 'Leap of Faith' was originally sung by French singer\/actress Catherine O'Hara.[2] It was given a French language treatment and is used for a few seconds in the final cut, but O'Hara is not included in the film. Copeland later revealed that the song was created by the English singer, Kate Nash.\n\nIn 2007, the Ratatouille theme was released as ringtones for mobile phones.\n\nIn 2008, Ratatouille and its sequel Ratatouille: The Cook's Classic Tale, Ratatouille 2: Gusteau's Grand Opening, Rat at the Grill and Rat-a-tat-Ta-Ta Tales were released as a set of three motion comics. The third motion comic, Rat at the Grill, was released on September 15, 2008. The other two motion comics, The Cook's Classic Tale and Ratatouille 2: Gusteau's Grand Opening, were released on December 17, 2008 and March 16, 2009, respectively.\n\nOn December 17, 2007, a limited edition bonus DVD with 5 minutes of additional material was released as a part of the standard release. The bonus material includes four animated shorts of Ratatouille characters. A Ratatouille mini-book titled \"The Great Cheese Chase\" is also given away.","token_len":476,"entropy":[10.1951,1.4569,8.6981,2.1545,0.0116,0.0003,6.5473,4.4274,2.078,3.1726,0.2139,2.4455,10.4319,2.9535,0.6895,8.8713,2.3618,2.6408,6.3089,2.7008,6.2104,6.2072,2.9254,8.2944,2.3544,5.0656,2.76,2.2337,11.2909,7.802,0.1527,3.0169,1.4152,6.0101,2.7693,3.417,1.9439,12.8336,5.8431,3.3184,0.0199,0.9383,0.7089,3.8085,2.3004,2.7554,6.3737,5.8259,1.0675,1.6099,6.931,3.6265,0.5181,5.1834,3.6005,4.5043,3.2949,2.3241,1.2543,7.2674,1.8051,0.0006,1.8669,5.2915,5.4168,4.1403,2.0323,6.5284,2.7697,4.8393,1.2375,4.8014,0.5124,2.9777,5.1533,2.0767,1.6797,5.4163,2.0088,1.4205,0.7571,3.013,2.9113,0.3075,1.1864,1.0263,1.9766,1.1884,2.1216,2.8258,7.2349,1.2201,1.3124,3.2916,5.415,1.1811,2.5479,0.4973,3.1652,6.3328,1.5724,0.0663,0.4662,0.0002,3.3663,0.9413,6.8309,0.4554,2.0704,2.1925,0.1085,0.0011,0.0012,1.1513,1.3177,5.0708,1.6048,6.8734,5.8085,5.7205,1.1234,3.1846,7.2113,0.0509,0.9344,0.0543,0.0002,2.0547,1.5117,6.7013,0.0755,0.9602,0.8954,7.6253,8.059,1.8567,1.5786,1.2353,0.0001,5.9364,1.5844,5.8926,0.0094,2.6224,1.0049,6.336,2.0536,1.5761,1.2701,2.22,4.9363,5.5776,3.896,2.3116,3.6117,4.7079,4.205,5.1776,0.9216,1.3049,5.3875,5.519,2.8228,1.3874,3.4104,1.4464,0.9578,3.4516,5.9339,1.7169,1.2827,9.0824,0.4642,5.7815,0.3714,1.9673,1.9136,4.7635,0.0891,3.7576,3.2312,3.1483,4.7088,1.0427,6.9161,3.2634,0.7011,2.7213,0.8332,1.3996,0.0001,5.6163,0.0035,5.558,7.2316,5.4418,11.2305,0.0767,0.2494,1.0772,7.5357,2.3514,6.2618,5.6382,0.5653,0.616,0.1692,1.3512,1.9986,4.9208,0.2754,5.7729,1.5521,4.0572,4.4533,0.0016,5.4406,4.2903,0.7385,1.0149,0.1609,2.9552,0.1394,0.0482,3.0266,0.6248,5.6583,1.1984,4.2429,6.4739,6.4669,2.7388,2.8585,3.836,3.2395,3.035,3.4199,5.4307,1.2728,0.3416,3.6295,0.9057,2.9857,2.0157,6.7468,0.0023,0.0063,0.0014,2.6711,2.0395,2.276,0.6779,0.2655,2.1886,0.9532,5.1617,0.0001,3.7695,4.0686,0.3421,0.9242,0.7231,0.7544,4.1308,1.1015,2.4195,4.9607,1.4253,2.8789,6.4787,4.6973,1.4761,0.5859,0.0001,2.0052,5.5897,0.1522,1.2813,2.6397,0.0029,0.0008,0.0011,5.9551,1.5865,3.0597,1.0,13.9003,2.0491,0.763,9.6457,1.5432,1.2558,1.458,0.0001,2.1261,3.0272,0.1197,1.9597,0.0018,0.0013,0.0014,4.6642,2.7069,1.4095,2.6603,0.0156,0.0208,0.0054,1.2082,1.5915,9.2535,2.6325,9.2387,6.1805,2.1494,5.5846,0.0045,0.0039,0.0088,3.3417,1.4679,10.5785,4.4627,2.6189,2.3825,6.6977,5.8406,0.887,1.6159,9.8717,0.659,5.3873,1.5826,0.5048,7.0194,3.9952,0.0323,3.5906,0.5937,2.6254,8.9255,1.1834,3.9521,8.2701,2.0055,0.452,2.544,2.7101,4.999,1.8921,2.9928,8.8964,8.4599,1.1832,1.3756,4.6126,4.6723,0.2402,1.5235,0.2839,4.3356,0.0878,0.7186,1.2179,0.8326,1.6285,1.9659,2.5872,3.2623,0.1708,1.7996,0.7879,1.4533,5.0632,0.7062,1.86,0.3362,1.3595,4.3793,4.5741,0.0961,1.1789,0.0629,0.3756,0.3559,0.0776,0.0041,0.003,1.868,0.0844,0.6892,0.0094,0.0004,0.017,0.0461,0.0038,0.2747,0.2897,0.2798,0.3364,2.3312,3.347,0.0388,0.33,2.6662,3.4908,3.4425,0.0104,0.2278,3.6058,0.0046,0.4344,0.7957,0.0001,4.1943,2.4694,2.5352,0.0341,3.7977,0.1047,3.01,5.5155,0.4899,7.3948,2.7171,3.4853,7.634,3.6194,0.2914,4.5193,3.5295,0.4939,0.1632,3.1441,1.3646,3.2202,0.0015,0.666,8.7034,2.4977,1.2815,1.2184,1.5511,3.8266,2.1382,3.9268,3.9885,2.3232,4.7278,1.3694,0.0135,0.0022,0.0032,5.6342,1.8915,3.8564,6.648,0.0195,0.0062,0.0035,4.6527,0.2471,3.7823,3.4625,2.4206,1.6319,5.2389,7.1133,7.6064,0.6533,2.1127,0.8776,6.406,3.7803,1.0482]}
{"id":4319,"ended":true,"length":434,"text":"Not many predators challenge an adult black mamba although it does face a few threats such as birds of prey, particularly snake eagles. Although all species of snake eagle commonly prey on snakes, the mamba is the only species of snake they will eat in the wild. The bird species will snatch up the snakes while they are still on the ground and then carry them away from the prey. Snakes may have a tendency to give chase to the eagles so the eagles often wait for the snake to drop before swallowing it, which can take up to 20 minutes. They will also eat moles because they are quick and easy to catch.\n\nSome birds of prey such as goshawks and peregrine falcons will prey upon the mamba as it is a relatively slow snake. The mamba will defend itself if it is attacked but there is no good way to fight back against either the eagles or the goshawks as they are much faster and stronger than the snake is and could easily kill it or severely injure it if they were successful in their attacks. Other birds such as kites, buzzards and red-billed hornbills will also lay claim to the mamba and will prey upon the snake.\n\nAs with all wild food, be careful if handling your meal. The black mamba is venomous as well as being poisonous and it is wise to exercise caution when handling it as you risk being bitten. If you do touch the snake you should remain as motionless as possible so that it is not alarmed by your presence and bite. You should then immediately wash the bite site completely to eliminate the possibility of the venom entering into circulation. Many snakes such as the black mamba will retreat into their dens during the day and emerge at night to chase off any intruders.\n\nIt is said that this snake is so well adapted to live on the forest floor that it prefers to hunt on the ground over trees. When it is ready to mate, it will search for a suitable male to breed with it. The black mamba uses echolocation to determine the direction of prey and its accuracy is even better at night. The snake uses its tongue to probe the ground to detect vibrations and it also uses it to sweep back through the ground for any sign of animals so it can pounce upon and swallow them.","token_len":476,"entropy":[7.1026,9.7488,10.805,4.8719,3.3151,5.9532,4.7211,0.4589,8.6097,2.3486,2.6409,5.9997,1.5263,2.1514,4.0125,2.4141,0.0012,6.0138,4.6046,0.0099,1.6201,5.8862,9.0105,5.6395,0.464,0.8985,4.3834,5.503,3.075,0.7827,6.0509,8.3131,7.8954,3.2104,0.1643,4.4679,0.5924,2.2007,3.9109,0.0993,1.3183,2.3496,1.0767,1.8252,1.7375,1.8077,6.3677,3.5225,4.0136,3.0137,1.4896,0.6308,0.3074,2.1533,6.4532,5.0125,4.1376,8.4621,1.921,1.2405,5.9131,5.0261,2.0193,0.8023,2.2134,3.7429,0.3878,0.2157,1.5491,2.5838,5.3515,0.3302,1.9949,4.2163,0.5719,4.0935,0.8409,5.9461,0.0777,3.8302,4.2351,2.0092,2.6933,0.0881,5.8668,1.8295,1.7047,2.1379,5.1876,0.0069,4.0523,2.4729,1.6348,0.0047,4.7375,6.171,0.9142,0.9761,3.142,0.2286,4.3073,2.6487,7.6258,1.6646,3.013,2.2383,1.9414,3.6672,2.1437,0.201,2.7023,0.9942,0.5499,4.4348,1.6851,1.8551,3.1816,5.7444,3.7849,4.7045,0.9693,1.3698,5.1092,2.5257,3.4051,0.4378,1.5289,0.6733,1.3805,0.0012,5.1175,3.8676,1.7974,0.0163,3.1639,0.002,5.4214,5.0479,0.6306,1.4122,3.6605,2.279,0.0098,0.2182,0.0486,0.0729,1.626,4.7036,3.1183,1.2057,1.0087,0.3993,2.7427,1.5472,1.5305,2.0157,4.8217,3.7099,6.1624,1.1015,2.1485,1.4505,0.0109,1.505,5.3835,0.3618,4.0792,1.6345,0.7564,1.3716,2.379,4.5512,1.1361,1.3207,4.7243,0.8288,0.2881,3.4226,1.2711,3.4936,7.3017,1.5594,1.6933,0.0033,0.062,0.3503,3.0527,0.0043,0.0935,3.6716,1.3075,1.3247,3.8637,2.3341,1.1274,3.6196,0.949,0.3895,2.3857,7.6251,3.1952,5.4253,1.3282,2.2737,3.0409,4.4787,6.5606,0.3198,0.562,2.6265,1.914,2.94,7.0233,1.8776,2.6081,2.1241,0.0695,5.1683,1.3767,1.9593,0.0022,4.8823,2.6668,1.5295,7.0322,0.0598,0.716,5.1024,1.878,4.9326,0.0177,7.3342,7.5948,0.0613,0.9084,1.6842,6.0279,5.9807,0.0436,0.2895,0.479,0.0033,1.8723,1.8353,5.3084,0.4667,1.3163,2.9715,1.5445,0.8592,0.0002,4.6836,1.802,1.1577,5.4863,6.0528,2.1774,5.0612,1.9312,3.8976,6.6386,2.7991,4.997,1.0735,2.413,5.214,0.1152,0.0011,1.6079,6.4755,0.0159,4.0099,3.1862,0.2764,5.4636,2.8772,2.1806,3.6007,1.1914,6.3512,0.1404,6.9245,0.4394,0.8336,0.4046,1.3755,2.1195,3.6841,4.9878,3.4497,0.4641,1.1256,2.7342,0.5633,2.5416,4.6913,0.8443,2.2823,2.3346,1.2778,6.7779,4.8245,6.7748,0.0041,0.1599,0.0254,2.5578,1.1321,2.0725,2.3155,0.7587,6.7684,1.8489,1.5899,3.776,1.8187,5.664,3.189,3.7529,0.9796,4.9203,4.1433,3.7265,1.5129,3.773,5.766,5.4602,4.0722,3.75,2.7078,2.4831,0.1008,3.3747,2.72,4.5795,4.2123,7.4111,0.5819,6.376,2.1523,5.055,0.0013,1.4423,1.642,0.16,0.0015,1.5066,7.1786,2.4493,1.5059,2.3123,4.4538,1.0386,1.0372,1.2517,6.5174,2.6748,0.0329,2.1063,5.8094,4.7279,3.3618,4.0659,0.0058,0.4881,0.9388,0.0002,4.4497,0.1717,6.8019,0.1154,4.8793,2.0624,1.2218,4.1425,4.9106,1.575,0.2344,2.784,2.4502,1.3634,5.8169,0.0999,0.1927,0.6851,5.857,0.8717,4.5727,2.7617,1.2649,1.0201,6.6162,4.1098,1.0802,4.0696,2.4157,0.876,4.8054,0.2554,3.9923,1.5173,0.7543,0.5847,6.3562,0.5514,1.684,3.1489,3.6394,2.7842,5.384,0.6066,5.0118,1.1234,1.8381,3.233,0.0087,0.0013,4.9372,6.9058,1.8999,0.0378,0.0196,0.8873,4.9479,1.3187,4.7,0.5481,3.7283,1.2243,4.0757,8.1573,1.935,5.684,0.4973,2.8202,7.2845,1.4718,2.1025,5.1707,4.2335,1.3912,3.7725,0.2476,6.1077,1.3714,1.7364,2.0736,3.3295,6.064,1.6122,3.8776,3.1634,0.8027,4.2262,0.8039,8.1987,5.1528,5.0121,0.6213,1.8288,2.8832,4.9294,4.387,0.0748,7.4468,6.6103,1.7098,1.7602,7.6636,0.1838,2.0803,4.5746,5.9127,4.3554,0.5044]}

Sinha spent around three months conceptualising the idea, and sourcing the fabrics from India. Once he had a vision of what the costume would look like, he brought the details \u2013 including the pattern cut on each arm, the embroidered motifs of the jacket, and the tassels of the scarf \u2013 to the US. The rest of the team spent around 40 hours on sewing each piece, stitching and designing.\n\nThe suit has been specially tailored and stitched in India, and is made from a wool felt fabric.

The team decided that Khan and Rampal should first try their hand at donning the outfits in real life, before shooting the film.\n\nSo what did the first dress-ups look like?\n\n\u2018We really didn\u2019t have an idea of how we would look or where we would go. Our aim was to bring the idea of a film character to life. For this reason, I decided to wear something I have worn before,' said Rampal.

This was soon followed up by the first look poster of the film on 15 September, which was then released on 17 September. On 23 September, Khan was again seen stepping out in the suit once more, this time taking a call. So who was the call intended for? He didn\u2019t divulge to what, and his fans are likely to have to wait until November 9 to find out.","token_len":477,"entropy":[7.23,9.5854,6.2989,0.3658,9.8354,2.3335,11.5237,1.6917,2.1108,4.678,0.7029,7.1044,9.6926,2.5486,1.5385,5.9292,8.9154,6.5848,1.5418,1.8,6.1091,0.9968,3.7871,1.8612,0.3496,5.797,5.0753,0.3751,2.1216,0.0043,0.3226,12.5048,2.6418,6.6686,6.8916,3.3001,1.4718,10.2671,3.1974,0.6394,4.4382,1.6091,1.2409,11.1338,1.4291,4.133,1.8408,4.4705,1.1211,6.0108,2.4887,0.9736,2.6048,5.6176,1.695,1.1171,1.3821,6.3984,0.8584,0.1137,0.0024,0.1853,0.6851,5.1142,2.0805,5.2734,7.6087,2.4106,1.2099,6.9291,8.9936,3.2688,3.0113,2.7989,1.9517,1.1945,5.2001,1.1684,4.5022,1.7581,3.7171,0.5825,7.0164,0.8138,0.6355,0.5286,5.9415,1.8512,0.3035,1.9975,0.2807,4.827,0.7561,0.5203,1.5226,4.3651,1.3522,2.4065,4.8602,1.3886,0.2659,2.9262,3.2412,3.8227,5.8988,0.7368,2.0452,7.5799,3.7851,1.7249,1.6627,5.3762,2.8905,5.2325,3.1567,0.97,0.0007,2.1,4.0423,3.868,1.7592,6.1848,2.9154,3.5461,7.0411,0.0078,2.6555,2.4949,1.2381,1.5186,2.0084,2.1563,1.4087,2.0543,6.1195,6.5105,2.3318,1.4929,9.1689,0.0229,3.0872,0.729,2.8557,1.2697,0.0001,12.2243,9.2766,6.3712,2.9797,2.7312,5.5384,0.9394,2.6758,2.8575,2.6002,0.0304,6.913,3.8221,14.6431,6.2622,6.5964,6.7027,0.8833,1.8221,0.8996,1.0965,0.7239,7.2771,5.4403,4.7427,5.6671,2.3095,0.3593,0.0609,0.701,4.1532,3.9275,0.027,1.886,9.0568,3.4372,2.5012,3.9136,8.7341,3.4852,6.1514,2.7503,2.1774,1.4172,6.0356,4.7779,2.292,5.5524,0.2507,1.2043,5.1346,1.3253,4.5252,2.5014,2.0231,1.8697,5.6135,5.1317,4.0792,0.6482,0.9598,0.0003,6.0463,0.8919,3.0505,1.9291,2.7496,0.1273,3.2607,0.1875,3.31,6.2399,1.9555,0.0153,0.6379,5.5782,0.8824,0.2286,1.4304,0.403,3.714,1.959,1.8162,0.3358,0.9846,1.7396,3.1182,4.8575,1.7017,4.0824,2.3953,0.2646,0.001,2.3546,6.9336,4.7276,2.1908,0.1836,0.0865,12.5652,0.0049,0.938,3.5041,2.3117,4.6667,0.0895,0.6815,2.9806,5.6198,1.736,2.1867,0.4668,1.1904,0.0003,5.4377,2.9661,2.3715,1.5759,4.7995,7.2161,3.5378,3.5113,0.2862,0.0004,0.3189,1.3002,0.0002,2.2079,5.946,2.8287,5.0403,3.3721,7.5544,4.2751,0.1302,2.8118,3.7666,0.415,0.9684,1.8765,2.2014,0.8269,2.3768,4.1747,4.0723,0.4277,0.4219,1.4333,1.482,4.5102,4.7062,0.1551,0.2658,4.352,1.5139,4.0903,0.7022,1.7732,6.7148,4.7807,0.8363,0.2195,1.6296,5.2947,2.704,2.4238,0.196,3.7018,3.2524,0.322,4.6247,4.3388,4.0468,3.9796,4.3064,1.9437,10.2331,0.493,3.1732,0.0062,0.6107,9.7027,0.0013,0.1082,0.0305,0.13,0.1016,0.0001,5.3828,4.0717,3.8907,1.936,2.9983,4.6261,4.46,0.6336,1.3331,2.0608,4.6189,2.1856,1.6783,5.2352,2.9063,1.4771,5.8239,2.0599,2.0225,7.3335,2.1101,0.0163,8.2628,1.8739,2.2878,3.2069,1.4762,3.7782,2.4615,8.9829,0.0152,0.0001,0.0227,3.2796,1.6429,10.5104,4.2682,5.0403,1.9223,2.7456,0.603,1.054,1.5102,0.0003,4.2901,0.0073,2.297,4.9315,2.2465,1.4651,0.9856,2.2696,2.2186,1.534,6.3499,0.4087,1.795,3.0185,4.6751,5.3401,2.4069,2.1454,4.6971,0.8875,6.4088,0.1063,2.8429,0.8186,1.5814,2.7062,3.8822,12.1881,2.5092,0.6343,1.425,1.8501,3.4883,1.7624,1.0895,1.59,1.9054,3.7227,2.8988,1.2627,3.8613,0.4853,0.3209,5.3871,3.8235,0.2953,0.1702,1.6575,1.6271,4.2261,0.3772,9.5514,1.3718,2.7895,0.6998,5.2017,7.2312,0.8261,0.76,1.5503,0.0021,4.8603,1.7178,8.4519,4.5485,6.8629,4.4747,1.1736,2.0433,7.1742,12.2395,0.7516,0.1393,4.8236,3.7408,1.0659,0.4071,0.1197,7.723,0.0005,5.3702,5.4,3.8713,3.0206,4.6974,6.8691,4.0237,4.4178,0.2171,2.0083,4.0785,0.3882,0.6786,4.2008,5.9273,1.0124,0.9435,0.0118,0.1436]}
{"id":987,"ended":true,"length":407,"text":"Tropical Storm Brenda developed in the north @ - @ central Gulf of Mexico at 0600 UTC on July 31. During the next 24 hours, the storm strengthened rapidly and attained its maximum 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 50 miles per hour (95 km\/h). The eye of the storm passed about 70 miles (113 km) off of the southwestern corner of the coast of southern Alabama between 600 and 900 UTC on August 1.\n\nBy the time the storm made landfall on the Gulf Coast, it was located near, about, west of Fort Walton Beach, Florida.\n\nRainfall: 4.20 inches (109 mm) at Tarpon Springs, Florida.\n\nPeak Surge (Waterspout\/Tornado): 6.23 feet (19 cm) at Venice Beach, Florida.\n\nFatalities: 3 people were killed \u2014 one motorist in Florida and a pair of Florida fishermen.\n\nCars and boats in many states were submerged by powerful waves and tornadoes that were spawned by the storm.\n\nCasualties: 43 people were killed and more than 300,000 left homeless.\n\nTropical Storm Claudette formed in the central tropical Atlantic on July 30. It was the second named storm of the season and the first of what is predicted to be an active Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nIn addition to Tropical Storm Claudette, six other tropical storms or hurricanes were developed during the second week of July : Andrea and Emily in the eastern Atlantic Ocean (which crossed the Leeward Islands on August 1, killing one person), Claudette and Alberto in the central Atlantic and Cindy in the northern Gulf of Mexico (all of which were absorbed into other systems later that month).\n\nClaudette, the second named storm of this year\u2019s hurricane season, formed southwest of Bermuda on July 30 at 1100 ET. The storm moved across the island and strengthened into Tropical Storm Claudette, which crossed through the U.S.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, Cuba, and the Bahamas before dissipating in the southern Atlantic Ocean near Florida on August 5. The storm killed 10 people. The storm produced $1.8 billion in damage (1996 dollars), making Claudette the costliest storm for any U.S. tropical cyclone since Wilma in 2005.","token_len":477,"entropy":[9.4959,1.028,1.7385,9.9789,9.3942,2.0887,1.4966,4.6739,10.7243,7.6575,4.2843,7.7484,6.2393,0.8913,0.0358,4.0119,4.7446,3.9682,1.2998,1.936,3.9931,4.0333,1.7449,6.2338,1.16,5.4402,1.9702,0.1327,0.8082,1.3816,0.9137,4.2624,4.4431,1.5767,9.1786,2.6479,0.9044,8.3148,1.6118,2.5622,3.6073,1.1223,3.0652,0.8333,4.1111,2.6977,0.0849,0.0018,2.1246,4.0979,0.26,0.1731,0.0246,0.6704,1.3366,9.7682,0.7538,0.3698,0.2042,4.2577,5.1607,4.5306,0.7355,1.3952,5.3048,0.0859,0.1249,4.0466,2.0335,1.0102,5.1786,4.4067,0.0387,0.5058,4.4215,0.9098,4.1059,4.3481,6.0532,8.7409,0.4014,3.3472,0.8111,0.697,2.4759,2.2965,0.38,2.1886,0.002,5.5781,1.5245,1.2585,0.7691,0.6208,4.5371,0.0276,1.6543,1.3862,1.5255,0.8044,1.2164,1.7917,1.033,6.2646,3.6419,7.0772,3.3694,1.1174,8.2135,0.0724,5.4993,5.2905,0.0776,0.6338,1.3165,0.7091,2.1401,0.0003,6.5473,0.8829,3.934,5.1725,1.7668,5.9329,1.2274,0.7475,6.4852,0.9463,0.1839,3.1196,7.7585,4.6507,1.1767,0.3055,0.8366,2.4444,1.4037,0.8709,0.0003,7.9811,0.156,7.6451,4.0452,4.6883,7.6649,1.761,0.7384,4.7787,3.4468,5.1227,0.3571,0.3016,3.1016,0.27,4.9423,4.5523,0.0676,4.813,3.2858,0.0624,0.5886,9.7236,0.5143,0.1428,0.4908,0.2839,0.2318,0.0003,4.8565,3.5731,3.0402,0.3963,3.2383,3.8256,3.4496,0.4302,8.5238,1.9957,8.1826,0.4118,3.42,2.95,1.3151,2.8915,6.8477,0.1264,5.4877,3.9086,0.9419,0.6459,0.0003,5.6759,4.226,2.9064,4.7376,3.3745,7.2452,3.3706,1.4309,4.1365,2.8246,8.9668,3.8469,2.4474,5.2239,0.0356,2.8749,3.2491,8.3537,0.6711,0.9863,0.9231,0.4145,0.956,0.0003,9.2093,0.1927,0.672,0.4069,6.6855,0.9316,0.4921,0.6827,1.4792,2.843,0.0381,3.0411,3.2598,0.0019,7.0266,0.9238,0.9201,0.3899,0.0002,4.4366,0.7923,0.0063,0.0701,9.3964,2.904,3.8608,0.848,0.1062,3.5573,5.5358,2.7529,2.872,0.6841,2.05,1.0379,2.4477,1.4966,2.2883,2.1781,6.4258,2.6675,2.5137,0.5224,1.5476,2.0486,1.324,2.2047,2.9875,6.0019,2.6746,6.0627,0.0576,0.2142,4.5971,3.963,4.3146,0.6368,0.1187,0.2587,0.6654,0.0002,2.9961,2.4517,0.2336,4.5116,0.0472,0.0666,0.0037,0.1222,6.3356,0.731,1.38,0.7952,6.528,2.6744,1.274,7.8929,2.3582,0.3582,4.318,1.6778,0.1089,0.404,9.1401,11.4398,4.0237,7.6699,3.6298,1.3673,3.1464,1.7613,2.3445,2.777,5.5854,6.224,0.5662,9.3445,0.6165,0.0038,0.7003,1.5675,2.274,2.1806,2.4727,7.0813,4.3962,0.2505,1.2471,8.1926,0.1855,3.0086,8.1413,0.4388,0.0796,2.5391,1.2919,3.6045,7.1893,0.6765,0.0796,3.2373,3.4578,0.2519,0.0193,0.7149,4.3897,2.0508,0.1397,2.218,8.7881,2.1451,7.625,5.7035,5.5729,2.4053,2.715,0.9479,0.4121,0.0003,6.2797,0.0341,0.054,2.7287,3.0006,1.9685,0.3535,0.5009,0.8409,5.5002,1.7701,14.0805,7.9979,6.5511,4.8275,0.0616,0.2055,4.1827,6.9503,0.1096,4.2463,0.7116,0.7938,1.7552,3.8954,6.7258,5.101,0.7782,1.9074,0.8898,3.3379,4.9373,0.3121,5.9463,3.4787,5.1328,4.4265,6.6839,0.1021,0.6995,0.0026,2.2208,1.6561,3.6604,5.376,0.6266,5.2492,0.0036,0.0207,0.1881,5.8188,0.0607,3.2865,0.0044,3.4545,3.466,0.0012,0.6997,7.1837,0.0006,0.6957,2.5476,0.4936,1.2617,1.438,1.536,4.1238,5.4671,0.0012,2.1639,0.5066,3.6961,1.9768,1.2223,4.4775,3.9098,1.3887,0.9254,3.3412,0.2083,2.7262,0.6325,6.4072,4.1102,0.0915,2.0822,3.0653,1.7549,5.8005,6.4121,2.2497,0.3161,2.6159,0.2437,0.3967,1.0251,4.2866,10.4291,2.0683,1.7472,4.2279,3.8439,0.0045,0.3749,7.689,0.0013,2.1239,4.5679,4.0941,3.5598,0.0006,0.0017,0.0111,4.2825,1.394,0.0052,1.8122,7.9402,0.1382,0.7023,4.4423,0.2518]}

{"id":1866,"ended":true,"length":411,"text":"Tonnage of goods shipped by barges on the Missouri River has seen a serious decline from the 1960s to the present. In the 1960s, the USACE predicted an increase to 12 million short tons (6,300,000 long tons) per year by the year 1983. The decrease to 1 million short tons, while continuing a slow decline, may have been related to the loss of an Army Corps of Engineers dredge (S-812). The S-812 lost its dredge because the Army Corps of Engineers did nothing, in response to complaints from a local official, to repair a siltation problem in the river. That means that barges carrying grain are now only allowed to travel upriver from Kansas City, Missouri, to Omaha, NE. and only a relatively few barges are allowed to enter Chicago, Illinois, to deliver grain there.\n\nThis page lists the dredge S-812, which was sunk on October 13th 1984 in the river between Kansas City and Omaha, NE. At the time of its loss, the dredge was known as the \"S812\".\n\nThe S-812 had been constructed in 1957 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers at a cost of US$7,000,000. Its main function was to clear silt out of the river channel. It was in good condition as of the year 1984.\n\nAt the time it sank, the dredge was estimated to weigh more than 2.4 million long tons (2.1 million short tons). To obtain an idea of the size of this object, consider that a 20-foot-long (6-meter-long) American football weighs about 14,000 pounds. If the S-812 were to lie at the exact center of the Kansas City \/St. Louis river bottom, this object could have displaced some 28 million (12 million + 14 million) pounds of silt per year.\n\nThe dredge sank in the area between Kansas City and Omaha, NE. At this point, it is near the confluence of the Mississippi with the Missouri River. It is located about 18 miles (29 kilometers) downstream of the confluence. That location is also near an area where many barges enter the river. Thus, if any vessel would crash into it, it would be severely damaged.","token_len":479,"entropy":[6.4464,2.7102,3.8926,9.4669,6.1006,2.2927,9.7087,0.0923,4.3915,1.6381,7.9658,0.5603,5.9542,5.5455,1.1094,7.4605,1.2644,3.7635,2.1796,4.2882,0.1034,1.2512,1.2453,2.0607,1.1303,2.3825,1.9216,2.43,0.0329,0.4257,1.3699,5.6236,11.404,7.2844,3.5093,1.6981,5.208,4.4055,2.7933,8.332,0.7388,3.6321,4.473,1.6001,3.5737,2.3244,0.0425,6.2148,0.1071,0.7144,1.355,0.0835,2.343,1.4424,1.9784,8.5779,0.7271,2.1312,4.3161,5.5668,3.4057,1.3564,2.4732,0.0214,4.3608,5.0832,5.2502,3.8407,4.9677,1.1453,1.05,4.6095,2.0763,0.8279,4.5842,0.0699,1.3194,4.7564,0.0335,5.3461,7.5199,2.6886,0.5536,0.0013,5.6321,0.7883,5.0199,4.8133,4.0615,3.87,7.8925,2.3066,1.793,2.1668,0.0335,0.0493,0.1001,7.1364,2.1309,3.8994,0.2588,4.9084,2.2979,2.8123,0.6176,0.8147,0.0055,2.7865,6.3036,4.203,4.6283,4.7244,0.0417,5.1267,0.8204,3.9929,2.4307,7.1432,1.3718,1.2084,4.1314,2.4905,5.1855,0.6186,6.6895,2.471,1.8073,0.7026,2.6068,0.7363,5.6117,6.7112,0.7277,8.4904,0.0125,3.2741,6.0759,3.932,1.526,5.0037,2.7356,0.2914,5.6822,2.8457,1.849,2.8526,5.0337,2.0192,1.2521,0.4797,0.7559,1.5058,6.4282,0.2255,5.7504,0.9023,8.5897,4.9111,3.7859,6.2629,3.2154,2.4433,0.0088,2.0939,0.3031,0.4948,2.9312,7.5085,1.9115,1.1473,1.113,1.2468,3.8794,1.5507,5.0425,0.322,1.8811,0.0246,4.0469,7.7087,2.9947,1.0709,8.228,0.4557,9.1746,0.0449,0.0953,0.0367,2.19,1.6357,1.4245,4.7549,2.8976,2.8971,3.7817,3.1138,7.1952,2.9278,1.0835,4.0449,5.8964,2.9708,0.0129,0.8063,0.9951,0.701,0.9369,0.4561,5.2453,1.0181,0.1067,1.2072,2.1282,4.8393,0.2494,0.7858,3.5563,0.0244,0.6848,6.2968,0.3921,0.8195,1.2814,3.2387,7.3308,0.334,4.0469,1.7685,0.0002,1.7143,0.9316,0.051,0.0261,0.0073,3.6788,1.3602,4.7594,1.4649,4.5827,1.7116,1.1563,3.3158,0.1108,0.6743,0.2035,0.0182,0.0029,4.158,2.7939,0.5885,0.0768,3.7114,0.1363,4.0923,1.3277,1.5715,1.1463,0.2949,0.5361,4.5892,3.2722,4.2291,0.2074,0.2324,4.8174,5.2798,0.0039,4.6123,0.0931,0.5583,2.4074,5.5638,1.883,2.1228,0.6845,5.3533,4.0034,1.1642,4.353,0.7285,2.6981,3.6608,2.6759,1.0036,1.7833,0.0002,4.8597,0.6635,0.1928,3.8714,2.7479,0.246,1.045,3.662,0.0319,0.642,4.0535,0.2829,2.4819,3.9902,0.0103,2.8738,2.5008,2.6516,0.772,6.056,0.0314,1.4027,2.1313,1.788,3.0711,0.1025,3.1931,0.008,0.7229,5.3267,5.2732,3.7052,4.424,0.0768,0.7845,1.2332,0.2374,2.9226,6.068,0.1772,2.8888,1.5897,3.119,5.2462,0.7675,0.4825,1.8967,0.5963,2.0722,2.4233,1.2499,0.3405,1.9141,1.5237,0.0138,7.6207,4.7522,8.1093,1.7918,5.0393,0.9437,0.5123,1.1088,1.5493,3.4176,1.1884,1.635,0.0354,0.0085,0.0013,1.9561,1.0162,6.9313,3.1619,0.8215,7.9053,2.6128,0.1128,0.3508,5.5375,0.0967,8.4341,10.9909,0.179,0.108,1.9589,6.8691,0.2278,3.6558,5.2064,3.1119,2.9538,6.8154,4.0938,6.1563,2.2446,6.6002,5.2442,1.0594,6.781,4.3039,0.6905,1.3851,2.7344,0.7559,2.625,0.0139,4.5141,0.7601,0.5401,0.9932,0.0002,1.5384,4.1572,0.0308,3.7242,2.0962,1.7127,6.3324,1.7136,2.1305,0.0044,0.223,0.0532,0.4506,0.337,1.2649,3.6695,2.6974,1.7791,0.4845,2.3489,2.0662,8.1978,0.6789,7.1204,0.0017,0.0572,0.3927,4.3819,7.2762,0.9981,0.3271,0.7332,0.5338,2.6438,1.1996,3.6147,1.6264,4.5827,0.1714,1.9406,4.3932,0.8742,0.0202,3.2612,0.5582,0.9544,4.4042,0.0041,2.0018,5.8581,4.1004,1.191,3.3459,3.9769,4.1771,2.244,2.5642,5.0709,2.6099,0.0039,4.8894,1.0618,1.4825,1.7988,5.9437,0.187,3.0279,5.4435,5.2176,4.302,7.9052,0.756,2.4325,0.3286,0.708,0.4996,1.5505,6.411,0.3176,0.6315]}

{"id":3375,"ended":false,"length":419,"text":"During the time of its release, Illmatic brought a renewed focus on lyricism to hip hop \u2014 hearkening back to the heyday of Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane, and Rakim. The album was certified 5x platinum by April 2004, after a year into its release, selling more than 2 million copies, while being ranked at #3 on Top R&B\/Hip-Hop Albums (Billboard 200), and #9 Top Albums (Billboard 200) on the American Recordings Chart, and it helped to define the sound and style of East Coast rap during the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nBorn Antron Amadou St. Jules, Nas had an interest in hip hop from the age of 13, when he and his friends in Queens formed a trio called \"The Naturals\", which was his first foray into public performance. As the group was not a success, Nas started freestyling more, and eventually formed his first group, the Uptown All Stars, which became a duo with DJ Kool DJ EZ. The duo signed with Ruffneck Records shortly before the release of their first single, \"Hits From The Bong\", and it became a sleeper hit and was later used by DJ EZ as one of the album's samples. Soon, Nas went solo and gained national recognition with the albums Illmatic and Stillmatic, which both came out in 1994, although the latter was not promoted well enough. To this date, Illmatic is considered one of hip hop's true classics, for many of the same reasons given for its acclaim: Nas uses strong imagery, both verbal and visual, to illustrate the struggles of the inner city drug dealer and the difficulties of being a child of East coast and West coast gangs.\n\nThe title track, \"Illmatic\", was released as a single with \"Hits From the Bong\" as well as the B-side \"N.Y. State of Mind\" in February 1994. By the time the album had been released later in 1994, it had hit #1 on the Rap portion of Rap Genius' Singles Chart, #2 on Top R&B\/Hip-Hop Albums, and at the time it sold more than half a million copies.\n\nTrack listing\n\nDeluxe edition bonus tracks\n\nTrivia","token_len":481,"entropy":[1.9437,4.9527,1.2344,3.6765,3.5936,0.4869,10.3415,3.7195,6.8626,2.2673,6.4435,0.6975,0.2962,10.3971,0.3186,3.3806,5.4612,2.3047,5.0537,6.7058,9.1187,0.0721,0.0418,0.0356,1.0622,5.4683,0.0037,0.0241,5.8413,2.2729,3.2592,0.2083,1.6249,7.6634,4.1805,0.0126,1.3675,0.5829,6.6222,0.0163,1.1352,2.5084,1.9457,2.2221,7.1055,8.4329,4.0562,0.62,1.4581,10.0616,5.4239,0.7789,4.6452,2.2186,3.7173,8.4488,1.1497,1.534,1.2965,6.1,2.1414,0.0218,2.7449,0.6532,0.1955,2.9942,4.185,4.1944,4.9407,3.9831,1.4651,2.8158,0.4763,5.9379,3.7973,0.0593,0.0028,2.6553,0.4502,0.0008,0.725,0.0067,0.5797,0.0666,4.1014,8.9493,0.7671,7.326,2.6545,1.9324,2.1006,3.8476,8.8591,4.0334,0.3169,1.0423,5.0906,0.0169,0.9325,1.9263,3.1859,1.1062,5.5712,6.7129,2.2705,1.0194,3.1109,2.2411,4.8106,5.7685,3.3187,4.1082,0.9259,4.386,4.1526,1.9632,0.0661,8.0351,0.1862,1.4431,5.2895,0.4795,2.2405,1.9541,0.066,1.2592,0.0426,0.0049,0.0003,0.1617,1.0483,0.0003,5.9853,8.6754,7.7379,6.9193,6.3508,1.1674,7.2774,2.0053,5.6343,5.5758,2.662,9.0052,4.114,3.4018,4.378,0.0128,2.1387,0.5671,2.8567,0.3514,1.858,0.0041,3.0645,1.2828,1.8966,0.1807,3.667,0.6298,3.4265,3.9744,6.3933,3.3684,2.3185,3.6812,0.556,2.5793,2.0032,4.676,5.2345,0.2965,4.2128,1.5348,2.38,6.5568,0.8141,2.4332,0.0219,7.4025,3.6564,0.7761,3.736,2.1648,2.1342,3.4467,5.711,3.2815,4.8604,0.4496,2.9154,4.3509,10.2971,0.3938,0.012,5.0488,2.8621,1.5969,2.6784,3.4445,2.0385,4.2103,3.8144,0.6784,1.9068,5.7105,2.8215,0.0153,8.4235,1.6642,0.6441,1.3544,3.0974,1.7718,6.9732,1.9388,4.3965,4.5054,0.8804,9.3292,6.1364,5.221,1.3301,1.7733,1.671,7.0345,1.2153,9.5423,6.4584,1.4071,5.1604,2.0541,1.0682,1.0144,0.0478,1.5637,1.6919,1.9979,0.5021,0.3945,4.3877,5.229,5.5662,1.5082,5.7373,5.305,1.8385,1.7654,3.7186,2.0318,1.4024,9.2611,0.0682,3.6502,3.5445,4.7188,3.9828,1.7258,4.5525,3.4675,0.0932,2.7505,3.6674,0.0123,1.2466,3.7888,0.0598,9.9179,0.4024,5.751,1.3197,1.977,4.8376,3.0768,1.4821,5.6886,4.4408,1.9203,2.3676,2.0207,7.2338,7.9894,0.0006,1.4998,8.0078,5.6825,0.6758,1.6358,4.0206,4.2636,0.192,0.9324,3.952,2.1607,5.6373,1.8606,1.9258,1.7127,3.198,7.438,4.9577,2.2414,2.0361,6.6044,1.6631,4.7324,0.0627,2.2153,0.0009,2.4642,1.9484,0.9527,0.0025,4.6448,0.1268,0.021,7.0423,3.4323,0.7856,6.4001,3.8109,2.8075,1.3274,1.7445,0.0077,7.5814,2.2287,1.5108,7.1596,1.86,3.7871,6.2883,6.4444,4.886,1.2851,5.3523,5.1782,0.0238,3.2396,0.2283,0.8946,4.7743,1.7779,7.3484,0.8085,1.9929,4.7684,2.699,8.4202,4.134,1.9514,1.947,6.9375,0.8339,3.3204,0.8388,5.7727,2.7122,9.4051,5.1385,5.9271,4.0632,2.0293,4.2395,0.3287,0.6651,0.0002,2.4785,5.9719,0.8632,1.6018,0.6048,6.5892,0.0099,1.0223,1.7477,1.4926,2.579,0.8366,0.5726,4.3994,3.5245,1.9988,0.0555,0.0484,2.1709,0.0645,0.0024,0.4113,3.7141,4.0158,0.1437,1.8858,6.8664,0.7251,0.0675,2.656,4.9242,4.0232,2.6722,0.3236,5.1312,1.7556,0.3515,1.2107,1.9853,4.3114,2.8592,0.5036,5.3657,1.2334,1.3582,1.2132,1.2272,4.8282,1.0347,0.3705,7.014,1.8888,1.5429,0.096,2.0475,0.7318,5.1327,1.2542,1.4889,0.1839,1.056,6.7095,11.9681,0.0237,4.1016,6.2739,3.6521,6.2486,0.1087,1.0042,0.7942,5.5549,1.9013,0.2011,3.0295,0.3368,0.0048,0.0016,0.1831,0.025,0.001,0.0451,0.0027,0.0717,0.0072,0.4456,0.1215,5.3508,2.0805,2.5328,3.6091,4.2622,1.5958,0.0049,5.3914,0.3329,0.0229,0.0569,0.639,2.1205,0.0001,7.0569,1.8446,0.7769,0.0002,7.7042,0.6791,1.9953,7.4459,3.1136,0.5344,0.0002,4.3875]}
{"id":1390,"ended":true,"length":367,"text":"In 1867 Ezra Millard, Andrew J. Hanscom, and Augustus Kountze formed the Omaha Horse Railway Company to provide horsecar service in the city. By the late 1870s the line had five miles of track, and the line was expanding quickly. The first streetcars to service Omaha were electric streetcars, but the city didn\u2019t have an adequate supply of power, so in 1876 it built the first steam-powered trolley.\n\nBy the late 1870s the line had five miles of track, and the line was expanding quickly.\n\nThe early 20th century saw streetcar lines built to and from downtown Omaha, including Union Station, which connected to the St. Joesph and the St. Paul lines. The city\u2019s streetcars were painted in a variety of colors. The line to West Point, Nebraska, was part of the Union Pacific railroad \u2014 known as the \u201cUnion City Line\u201d \u2014 and ran east-west between Omaha and Council Bluffs.\n\nIn 1930, the North Street line was part of the Union Pacific \u201cPacific\u201d trolley line and connected to the \u201cUnion City\u201d line, or route A. The St. Joseph and Valley City lines were part of route B, and ran south-north connecting Omaha and Millard to the Omaha, St. Joseph and Union Pacific train station. The north-south portion of the system was transferred to the city in the 1950s to facilitate rapid growth.\n\nOmaha\u2019s streetcars ran parallel to the interstate highway system for many of the 21st century. Since 1993, many have been replaced with high-floor buses, which are less environmentally friendly than the streetcars. The last of the vintage Omaha Buses were taken off the streets in 2007.\n\nThis project is generously supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities.

{"id":448,"ended":true,"length":471,"text":"The comic book's initial cancellation, and the introduction of the character to DC led to many negative feedback and reception. I, Vampire writer Joshua Hale Fialkov expressed sadness he would never see the final book completed, calling the process \"a dream\" that was ended \"too soon\".\n\nFialkov, while a comic book writer, also had experience with the world of film through \"Dead Rising 2: Off the Record\", \"The Wolverine\" and the upcoming \"Wolverine\", and says working with director Gavin Hood was a \"great experience\". \"We had the script and the characters, and I remember sitting down with Gavin one day and just saying how fun it was to work on the book and how exciting it was to me that there were these characters and stories to be told\", he says. \"It wasn't difficult to create excitement - there was no need to do that. The characters were a lot of fun to work on and there was a lot of creativity in the scripts, and that was very satisfying\".\n\nThe writer also commented on the initial reaction to the announcement of \"I, Vampire\". \"What bothered me was that so many people reacted so negatively to what was, to me, a cool idea\", he said. \"I'm proud of the series and the creators and everything that was done, but yeah, I was disappointed I couldn't get the fans to give it a chance before it ended. But the worst part? It was all those die-hard fans that hated it after they watched the movies and decided to write me nasty things on Facebook. But that stuff does not bother me anymore.

{"id":4257,"ended":true,"length":434,"text":"Outdoor air pollution has a small effect on increasing the risk of lung cancer. Fine particulates ( PM2.5 ) and sulfate aerosols, which may be released in traffic exhaust fumes, are associated with lung cancer, the authors concluded.\n\nIn addition, the health effects of exposure to nitrogen dioxide, black carbon, and ozone have also been shown to have a small, if any, influence on the risk of lung cancer, the authors added.\n\n\"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cohort study to report the cumulative effect of air pollution on lung cancer risk,\" the authors wrote. \"\n\nThis was a retrospective analysis of cancer registry data from two large German registries of lung cancer cases from 1973 to 2008. The authors had access to data and were able to follow patients on average nearly to the end of diagnosis.\n\nIn addition, the analysis involved about 3.4 million people who were part of the general German population but were not directly exposed to air pollution, the authors explained.\n\nAmong participants exposed to air pollution, the risk of lung cancer was found to be 11% to 16% greater with long-term PM2.5 exposure and up to 9% greater with long-term SO 2 exposure. No significant increased risk was found for nitrogen oxide ( NO ) or ozone exposure, the authors found.\n\nBased on their findings, the authors concluded that exposure to air pollution was associated with lung cancer at all exposure levels. However, exposure to air pollution was not associated with increased risk at all levels of NO, ozone, and SO 2 exposure, and was associated with only modest risk at PM2.5 exposure levels, they added.\n\n\"Although the exact underlying mechanisms in lung cancer are unknown, the potential detrimental impact of air pollution on the cells of the lung suggests that it may trigger a negative feedback loop whereby the accumulation of air pollution acts as a self-propagating process resulting in further increases in air pollution, which may act as a further trigger of cancer development,\" the authors wrote.\n\nIn a related editorial, John P.A. Ioannidis stated that the results of the study should be interpreted in the \"larger context\" of other research on air pollution's effects.\n\nCancer News depends on support from readers like you to help us serve you best.

{"id":729,"ended":true,"length":416,"text":"Jifna, along with most of Palestine, was annexed by the Rashidun Caliphate under Umar ibn al @ - @ Khattab after the Battle of Ajnadayn in 634. The town became less politically powerful under Umar, and was eventually lost permanently after he was killed in 641.\n\nA large part of Jifna is now occupied by Ras al-Jadd, which is an archaeological site.\n\nIn 1848, an Ottoman census recorded a population of 3,600 Muslims, increasing to 4,500 in 1860. By the mid 20th century, Jifna and Ras al-Jadd were under the control of the French Mandate for Palestine. From 1945 Jifna and Ras al-Jadd formed part of the Jaffa District in Israeli. In 1994, as part of the Oslo Accords, Israel ceded part of Ras al-Jadd to Jordan. Most of Jifna and much of Ras al-Jadd fell under the control of the Palestinian National Authority in 1995 after Israel withdrew from the West Bank. The last few settlers left in 1999.\n\nAfter the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, the British transferred power to the United Nations, which founded the Palestinian Authority (an interim governing body, with Arafat as president). On November 25, 1994, the Arab Peace Initiative was announced in Cairo. It called for Israel to withdraw all its forces and settlements from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and the Golan Heights within a period of five years; and establish a Palestinian state with its capital in East Jerusalem. Other Arab states would immediately recognize the new state.\n\nIn November 1995 the PLO (Palestinian Liberation Organization) was accepted as a member of the United Nations.\nAt the UN General Assembly, the following evening, the Palestinians were recognized as the representatives of Palestinian rights.\n\nOn March 26, 1999, the United States, as well as the European Union, announced that they no longer recognize Jordan's sovereignty over the Jordan Valley and Golan Heights, which it had occupied since gaining independence from Britain in 1949. The following week, Russia announced that it did not recognize Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem. Other UN member states which now do not recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights include Pakistan, Senegal, Ghana, Venezuela, Honduras, and Burkina Faso.","token_len":482,"entropy":[7.7378,7.7416,2.63,6.6133,0.0178,6.2421,0.5067,8.635,2.1253,3.0175,5.3797,1.1484,1.1632,11.1906,1.3712,5.9314,5.3562,0.3819,4.2964,5.6836,1.2056,1.3078,1.1059,16.7341,8.6484,5.892,4.8135,3.8979,0.0597,6.0567,1.3531,3.8085,0.0149,5.693,1.17,11.3712,7.0042,1.6875,3.3384,3.2627,1.359,2.1778,6.2653,3.8482,7.5272,6.8765,3.5931,3.9342,1.068,0.07,3.2353,1.6822,2.4553,3.5651,5.1286,7.7936,4.1267,3.1211,1.2134,1.6911,1.4418,1.2168,3.6112,0.4841,1.8377,0.119,4.2086,5.0595,1.7384,0.0037,5.9404,0.3218,0.0073,2.1631,1.7442,2.6358,0.0944,8.0878,1.9679,0.5036,3.7902,9.4816,4.7067,2.6873,1.227,3.8641,7.538,0.3147,2.0384,1.7884,0.0003,3.1066,4.9485,3.753,0.6893,4.0993,3.3496,8.6112,4.1247,2.9718,0.8724,0.0911,3.5965,0.1673,4.3236,6.1303,1.4002,8.0119,0.6791,1.916,0.0213,2.2725,1.6221,3.6795,0.4643,3.3622,1.7555,3.0447,3.4244,0.0208,0.0844,0.2254,3.0892,0.0135,0.0054,4.7261,4.236,0.0155,0.0254,0.0201,0.1614,0.8855,3.7381,1.3257,0.2488,0.0191,0.9432,4.9243,6.4676,0.0345,3.7055,2.6675,0.8925,5.9811,5.8851,8.7464,0.0112,0.0056,2.9281,0.1303,0.0034,0.007,0.0033,0.0454,5.757,2.5188,0.0031,0.6329,5.1246,2.4473,0.1011,5.8169,2.0502,7.5044,6.643,2.5952,6.3498,0.6029,5.4027,0.3939,0.0007,0.8298,2.5858,0.4649,0.0,0.3142,2.0533,7.7781,0.0265,3.1473,0.0011,4.2539,0.0224,0.0057,0.0051,0.3208,0.3509,2.6369,0.7165,7.0847,0.5338,1.771,0.0453,0.0048,2.5646,9.5834,0.0215,0.8547,0.0017,0.0032,0.0033,0.0528,5.5879,1.0475,0.62,0.1887,0.0039,0.7113,2.9253,3.7171,0.309,2.6969,3.5107,4.8208,3.3533,2.2058,0.6572,0.8543,1.7476,0.0003,1.013,2.6357,4.2277,5.3238,7.4163,3.1472,2.0528,3.154,1.3011,0.5405,0.0002,4.8168,1.0839,6.5754,0.0224,0.1105,0.5012,0.1159,0.0003,1.0171,2.8131,0.1279,1.565,4.6545,6.3553,6.397,0.5453,0.7682,4.3356,0.3474,2.3682,1.467,7.9614,0.4087,2.8284,0.2484,2.7379,11.725,3.606,5.0818,0.0676,3.2485,3.3238,10.0916,0.0009,0.8842,2.2034,0.5839,5.3926,3.4551,3.3992,0.117,2.138,0.1363,1.1849,5.0189,4.6574,0.9394,1.642,3.1772,2.585,1.7355,1.089,2.8357,4.2244,0.1978,4.3908,0.3477,1.9299,2.6333,2.6149,2.6925,3.0398,5.2666,0.5924,0.99,0.5536,0.0006,1.6046,3.8027,0.4823,0.013,0.2732,0.6803,0.9942,4.9158,0.0017,0.0284,5.7632,1.9434,2.4522,0.0332,2.3821,0.0744,4.828,2.9304,5.6918,0.714,1.1984,0.5161,2.9262,3.1868,3.1315,1.2745,3.6788,0.0005,0.4866,7.1229,2.781,0.9848,4.5169,5.8591,1.8952,1.097,3.101,1.7744,1.3098,0.957,0.0002,1.8855,4.2099,1.7818,3.106,5.398,0.0046,3.6634,1.2641,1.4248,0.0438,0.209,3.5072,7.2631,1.7378,1.0882,3.0477,0.1399,0.0905,1.8027,0.0131,1.4165,2.0511,19.9144,0.3757,3.2003,0.9853,0.0039,1.4207,2.015,5.178,7.4242,0.3888,2.0225,3.198,3.6789,5.2135,0.2442,2.3146,5.1306,0.0205,5.1218,5.2838,1.4566,1.43,0.0002,2.4791,2.5704,3.6419,0.0412,3.0784,0.1458,1.0118,2.4238,2.5894,3.1632,4.0304,3.1126,0.0036,1.144,2.0781,0.1226,0.3932,3.0149,1.0699,2.5122,7.6741,0.0002,2.8129,5.257,2.2473,2.9188,0.2353,0.9661,2.5235,0.7783,2.0061,7.867,0.0032,0.0558,1.7435,2.5832,3.7237,1.7655,1.7217,1.2293,12.8942,0.4729,0.8337,3.2177,0.3309,3.5454,0.1378,1.5024,4.794,2.4547,0.22,6.1157,2.4813,0.5738,0.3934,4.9637,0.1017,0.0744,4.9398,0.4271,0.1192,3.5319,1.2025,6.5291,4.6702,1.3063,0.0663,7.1601,5.4855,3.9414,1.173,0.0668,0.8246,1.193,0.3163,0.5608,1.0223,2.0723,0.0012,0.0407,1.3028,5.9091,0.1668,6.1327,0.0562,4.0782,0.0595,5.3876,0.1027,5.1601,0.0813,1.3918,5.5668,0.0003,0.0001,0.0003,0.159]}
{"id":670,"ended":true,"length":400,"text":"The tawny nurse shark may be one of the few fishes specializing in preying on octopus. Other known food items include corals, sea urchins, crustaceans ( e.g. crabs and lobsters ), and mollusks ( e.g. barnacles and sea urchins ). Its head is black, usually smooth, with two large, narrow, oval brown spots near the end of the snout ( see image 1 & 2, below ). These spots contain sensitive receptors that detect the prey\u2019s odour and help the shark locate prey at distances up to 20 metres ( see also 2, below ).\n\nDiet of the tawny nurse shark\n\nLike many shark species, the tawny nurse shark feeds on fish but often feeds in very close proximity to its prey as its sense of smell is very effective : its mouth is large, and its jaw is powerful. It catches most prey whole by biting into the sides of the prey, but is occasionally known for wrapping its jaws around its prey and eating it this way (see also 3, below ).\n\nThe mouth of a tawny nurse shark\n\nTawny nurse sharks are often seen chasing small fish in shallow waters and occasionally prey on larger fauna such as the blue-spotted trevally (Tetraplasma ocellatum).\n\nLife in the habitat of the tawny nurse shark\n\nThe tawny nurse shark is a common fish throughout Australia and as far afield as northern Australia and South Africa. It is often found in sandy bottoms of estuarine and coastal waters, but sometimes migrates to deeper waters for the winter. ( see Figure 3, below )\n\nFigure 3. Tawny Nurse Shark distribution map.\n\nBehaviour of the tawny nurse shark\n\nThe tawny nurse shark does not tend to bite the body of its prey as it would with other sharks, preferring to hold and eat whole pieces ( see also 3, above ).\n\nConservation status of the tawny nurse shark\n\nAs the tawny nurse shark is a common species, it is not listed as endangered in the wild. However, as it is a commercial species, it is listed as \u2018conservation concern \u2019 in some parts of its range in Australia and New Zealand.","token_len":483,"entropy":[7.9376,6.8543,0.0379,9.0086,10.9274,5.2269,1.181,3.2,0.1111,0.4059,3.6262,5.7026,12.1845,0.0657,7.5335,2.5663,0.1052,7.2351,1.3791,1.2877,5.5546,4.5815,7.4314,4.4477,0.16,5.8291,1.0894,0.2381,3.498,2.0616,0.0004,0.0822,0.226,4.289,0.0019,0.01,4.2035,8.2188,0.8888,0.1371,0.5393,5.7796,1.6146,4.312,0.0017,0.8165,1.7041,5.4827,0.0731,0.0422,0.4993,0.8804,1.7191,0.0023,0.0009,0.0182,7.1579,0.1584,1.6752,3.3234,0.6729,0.0008,0.0649,0.5561,6.2577,5.8589,0.8766,4.6479,1.7531,5.1574,6.7945,1.2245,1.3432,4.1668,2.7194,2.5813,3.9399,1.5331,4.9324,6.9848,2.1162,5.0549,0.4793,3.501,1.2011,0.707,5.0623,0.0155,2.5806,5.4331,3.7788,3.3849,7.0881,0.281,5.4645,2.2525,0.6735,4.9672,1.1499,5.6361,7.8759,4.5154,1.8121,4.2333,2.137,4.1496,12.8936,7.4912,6.0722,4.9902,0.6347,1.5959,5.8083,2.6752,1.9949,3.414,1.354,4.7643,5.5066,2.3283,0.0038,2.8362,2.9373,0.8917,3.0495,3.9216,4.7599,1.655,2.1256,0.4475,1.7848,0.0111,4.7312,2.5536,3.8868,1.2788,2.3951,0.0068,0.0012,0.1875,0.0843,2.0349,0.0002,5.7873,2.2518,4.7473,0.3168,0.1664,0.604,0.2052,0.0009,0.0005,0.0031,0.0453,3.3498,0.8127,2.6737,5.3824,5.1703,4.2034,3.8132,5.0206,3.9364,0.4888,0.218,2.8178,0.8573,5.5998,4.1893,8.7601,0.1172,0.2385,1.3202,2.7291,6.4501,9.0531,2.9161,3.3424,0.9319,3.5685,0.8922,1.9458,0.976,4.5987,0.5751,7.9782,1.2369,2.2393,7.526,4.6044,2.4405,8.5818,3.7772,3.6645,3.7024,1.3659,6.0817,0.2057,0.8463,2.7874,1.4179,3.2816,3.5142,6.1918,7.022,3.4732,8.5816,1.0359,3.1313,0.3792,2.1748,0.4729,1.9663,4.464,1.771,8.6407,0.0069,2.1576,0.4986,2.8846,2.0603,0.7028,0.5979,1.9931,1.2581,0.0002,1.6569,5.3659,0.952,2.9251,0.1132,0.0004,0.0003,0.003,0.0021,3.1462,0.0002,4.1219,0.0556,0.0127,0.5178,0.0353,1.1587,3.6681,2.3553,6.2496,3.0327,0.948,3.237,2.4419,1.1579,2.5552,4.4062,6.7064,0.4047,2.7256,7.7116,2.524,1.406,0.002,3.9264,4.2891,2.3049,5.8166,0.0321,9.3983,5.466,0.5719,2.5891,6.0274,4.5606,2.1534,4.2762,2.8349,5.4868,3.9193,6.0755,1.6271,2.8654,0.0002,6.587,4.3444,0.8861,8.0788,0.473,0.7,0.1103,0.0005,0.0007,0.0035,0.0069,0.245,0.0001,1.1647,0.4708,0.0013,0.0007,0.0048,0.0134,1.2262,1.682,3.4788,2.1068,5.5188,1.9776,1.2563,6.6266,3.3586,4.3783,0.0006,0.088,4.7147,2.7095,1.8599,3.3178,1.5905,0.4905,1.3281,0.7938,3.9616,0.7792,0.9709,5.0348,6.8638,0.014,3.1832,5.7972,0.0155,3.2201,1.3928,3.0763,1.1187,1.2889,2.8441,4.6544,6.3004,0.9874,1.2831,4.0687,0.7812,3.9408,3.5661,2.4813,1.2753,5.639,4.2293,5.4849,2.3441,1.8006,0.6768,1.3751,0.569,0.0002,2.4057,0.0184,0.7895,1.9182,0.0042,0.0013,5.8478,0.2294,8.6701,4.5656,1.3524,0.865,0.0002,5.9435,0.1721,1.2199,0.261,0.0666,0.0007,0.001,0.0019,0.0024,0.3788,0.0002,1.1812,0.2243,0.0013,0.0007,0.003,0.0048,4.0026,0.1317,5.6081,0.0429,3.5569,3.5639,3.3825,0.6392,0.8298,0.09,4.1303,1.4081,4.1491,3.3242,1.3051,1.2985,1.295,4.1459,0.3122,5.7306,4.4723,2.5625,6.3896,5.8396,4.3303,3.2132,1.8647,1.2422,0.3048,2.1512,0.4151,1.0848,0.0001,5.7817,0.0617,2.3186,1.0592,0.3134,0.0987,0.0008,0.001,0.002,0.0022,0.2409,0.0002,4.468,2.9216,0.8457,0.0026,0.0007,0.0023,0.0053,0.7897,1.4789,2.3442,2.6973,1.5747,1.4779,0.5837,1.8224,2.031,0.5392,1.7499,1.9127,1.2073,3.3993,0.6459,1.4061,0.0994,3.4636,2.8888,0.576,1.5939,6.1298,1.6583,0.7313,0.9615,0.7568,3.6575,0.5356,13.8841,6.487,7.4098,0.3655,5.5318,3.3132,5.7502,2.6243,4.4704,3.2236,0.0097,6.8495,1.0047,2.8566,1.7916,1.401,0.8861,0.0492,0.5009]}
{"id":1868,"ended":true,"length":440,"text":"Since the beginning of river commerce and industrial development in the 1800s, the Missouri has been severely polluted and its water quality degraded by human activity. Most of the river's floodplain habitat is gone, destroyed by urbanization, development, dredge spoils, and mismanagement of the river water. It is estimated that a mere 10 percent of the floodplain habitat still exists in its former \"glory year\" (1918), with the majority of the remaining habitat not suitable for natural floodplain functions.\n\nDuring the last decade, the Missouri water quality has improved significantly and has received international recognition and attention due in part to significant progress by state, federal, and local officials in restoring and preserving floodplain habitat on the river. However, there are still serious and significant problems in restoring and preserving the river to its former glory.\n\nThere has been a long history of industrial and urbanization on the floodplain of the Missouri River. This has changed the historic floodplain habitat on the Missouri and its tributaries, creating both a shortage of sediment and a lack of floodplain vegetative debris. The river has lost approximately 5,000 square miles of floodplain habitat and only a remnant of that amount remains. Only about 300 square miles of the Missouri's floodplain still has natural vegetation. It is estimated that only about 9 percent of former natural floodplain habitat (i.e. 5,400 square miles) exists in the upper river. Only about 3 percent (300 square miles) of the lower river still has nature.\n\nThe natural vegetation that is still present in the upper Missouri River is highly vulnerable to invasion by both aquatic and terrestrial plants (such as grasses, sedges, rushes, and other aquatic plants). The natural vegetation is also vulnerable to destruction by human activities. Dredging spoils and associated industrial wastes are dumped into the streams upstream of the natural habitats. If we want to see the Missouri River return to its \"glory year\" of the 1940\u2019s, we must restore and preserve natural vegetation.\n\nWe call for the federal, state and local governments to actively restore and protect the natural floodplain habitat in the upper Missouri River area as well as the natural floodplain vegetation in the Lower Missouri River Valley through comprehensive management actions.\n\nOur vision is for an improved, restored and protected upper Missouri river and lower Missouri river valley river habitat.","token_len":484,"entropy":[2.3024,4.7307,0.2422,13.1112,8.2241,3.5946,5.2183,2.5202,1.6954,0.9387,5.0341,0.1754,0.3159,1.6716,7.9429,7.124,1.3652,7.4078,3.8761,2.4272,3.931,2.6159,1.4963,5.3054,1.8212,4.4961,1.3694,0.5279,5.5791,0.8094,0.2646,2.599,0.8582,6.9974,1.7062,6.0145,1.054,4.4668,0.9683,7.4956,1.1432,5.1968,2.352,1.0954,5.3604,0.8315,7.5382,3.6662,11.8985,0.0941,0.8125,0.5993,7.5197,0.1719,1.0437,1.4698,0.8244,4.2761,1.016,4.3974,0.6497,0.646,0.0802,3.7362,4.3104,2.8527,0.9811,0.0368,0.3625,5.6118,0.1367,2.4073,5.4281,0.7798,1.7515,6.6386,3.9742,5.8686,6.6525,2.6367,5.7056,0.7328,1.9045,2.528,3.6028,2.6994,3.1619,2.0805,4.3463,0.8107,1.3373,1.1106,3.3539,5.2085,5.0761,0.093,6.254,3.6512,2.3598,7.9177,0.3966,1.0652,0.001,4.7652,0.5591,2.5746,2.5296,0.6367,1.283,0.9155,5.4501,0.7732,0.3796,1.7953,1.829,2.5227,2.7754,5.5512,4.2887,1.8609,2.7658,3.3595,4.1365,5.2382,0.4895,0.0028,5.8006,3.7421,3.5905,3.5384,3.1854,1.0177,0.1708,0.1691,0.9993,2.5134,1.4641,3.6243,1.734,3.4916,2.6941,0.1764,0.5627,5.52,0.6208,2.5724,0.5197,3.4659,0.0097,3.2789,1.0387,1.0122,4.7244,4.2024,3.1849,2.6319,2.5032,2.3914,1.4547,1.5653,1.9397,2.3624,4.5501,0.4389,1.2961,0.0337,1.616,1.0336,0.0002,4.5666,4.2229,0.1755,1.0122,4.5274,1.9263,0.0778,5.6103,2.2909,3.373,2.3524,1.3764,0.084,6.3207,0.0579,3.4441,0.6026,0.1403,1.1824,1.0404,3.3265,2.3435,5.55,1.6538,6.3562,5.2294,0.1183,1.8777,1.6603,0.1912,0.4076,4.0646,3.4369,5.9845,0.0022,0.0441,1.7795,3.6776,5.885,1.517,5.5959,0.2662,6.8749,0.9852,1.1443,2.9785,0.0075,4.3569,1.305,7.7193,0.2907,7.8612,0.7982,1.7291,3.4058,1.5311,3.7169,4.3814,3.8925,1.4771,0.4837,2.4909,0.1332,0.4102,1.9441,0.152,0.4909,2.4851,5.2677,2.2163,7.3255,0.2406,2.5552,5.7075,1.7849,0.9727,6.3253,1.8992,4.5297,1.257,0.0226,0.4933,2.0855,2.6719,2.9542,1.6578,0.0423,6.8335,3.7185,4.0791,1.4908,1.7307,4.4419,0.4484,0.2814,0.0432,2.1856,1.6163,5.2426,0.5141,0.0266,9.3449,6.0523,0.1771,0.1608,0.2564,5.4264,5.0827,0.0022,0.0011,2.2695,4.8915,0.7326,3.8064,0.1043,0.0475,0.4384,3.2591,1.972,0.5511,6.8336,4.4583,3.4494,4.8816,1.1285,3.0678,0.4989,4.2783,4.6288,0.1564,0.0234,0.0278,0.7676,0.587,4.1213,0.5824,3.6487,0.5551,6.6494,2.5329,1.0853,0.0002,1.452,4.3737,2.4189,2.7599,2.0151,3.1388,0.6563,1.5947,0.3606,2.9955,1.7424,0.9693,1.0085,4.9754,5.6651,0.1308,7.167,0.6954,6.7051,4.4885,0.609,0.7597,3.6627,3.9257,3.2905,0.0023,4.6634,1.2074,0.6229,5.6129,0.0371,0.0276,7.0358,0.1534,0.6451,3.3015,2.2798,1.7895,0.9234,1.7543,2.448,0.579,2.0979,2.2191,2.1873,0.0462,5.5655,0.5031,3.1022,0.9597,1.685,6.3816,2.3716,0.5278,4.052,0.0004,1.6386,8.2706,4.5699,2.4733,1.531,5.6472,0.9045,0.3721,5.5591,5.5257,0.8403,0.1311,5.0636,6.311,1.2637,5.597,6.0384,3.9503,0.1829,5.5599,1.3964,2.2893,0.9055,3.6174,0.0551,0.219,4.4423,0.4632,0.0029,0.2443,0.2842,3.0506,3.4586,5.5379,16.2779,8.4178,4.5871,0.6097,0.5237,1.2174,1.7048,1.6704,0.8451,2.513,1.8652,1.6484,0.8534,0.0002,4.4497,6.125,1.5352,1.3273,4.3339,2.2698,0.0908,2.765,0.02,0.5604,0.4187,5.9248,3.1805,0.6348,1.8188,1.5008,1.2603,1.327,0.0467,0.1414,3.2354,0.3802,3.1097,0.1568,0.1025,4.102,3.8292,1.2594,0.0134,1.5581,2.0449,1.0501,0.0235,2.429,1.7208,0.3843,3.0364,0.3444,0.0782,4.246,6.1977,5.4654,4.6492,4.2132,0.994,1.3007,0.0002,4.4261,5.7613,0.6958,2.2101,4.3959,3.0011,3.2012,5.8656,1.8046,1.4907,6.9983,0.2751,2.9366,3.1902,5.6404,0.9424,1.2232,1.9835,3.4102,2.7689,1.6479]}

{"id":2143,"ended":false,"length":410,"text":"Construction of the video sculpture was completed for testing without the fountain's water features on May 18, 2004. Originally, Plensa had planned to have each face appear for 13 minutes, however the final result is 30 minutes long. Although the first installation was to be placed outside, the fountain water has proven to be too loud, resulting in the first installation being placed inside.\n\nIn 2006, an installation was created on top of a 12th-century tower in the nearby town of Kostanjevic (, ), in the Republika Srpska entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The installation featured a projection of the faces of 13 historical leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the late General Bakir Izetbegovi\u0107, who was considered as one of Bosnia's greatest leaders. The project was executed by a company known as C-Cube. The tower holds a bell that rings every time a new historic face appears on the screen (approximately every 15 seconds), creating both a visual and audible effect.\n\nIn August 2006, a second installation was created by C-Cube in the city of Osijek in Croatia. The second installation featured a face of the 13th century Bishop of Zagreb.\n\nAnother installation featuring the faces of Bosnian historical figures was created in Plitvice National Park ( Plitvice Lakes National Park in Croatian) in July 2006, at the Jelsa Tower. This installation was placed atop the tower after a few hundred signatures on electronic petitions requested its installation. The installation was completed and publicly opened on May 31, 2007. On that day, the installation was timed to match the day that the Declaration of Independence of the Republika Srpska was signed by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107.\n\nAlso in July 2007, the Faces of Bosnia project created a temporary museum on the roof of Bosnia's National Theatre, Sarajevo. The museum had an entrance for the public, but no permanent displays were present.\n\nIn 2009, another installation of the Faces of Bosnia project was created on the roof of Bosnia's National Theater, Sarajevo. Also in 2009, during the 100th anniversary of the Partisan Bosnian resistance movement, the Bosnian National Theater hosted a major exhibition of the construction of the Faces of Bosnia project.\n\nGallery","token_len":486,"entropy":[3.3333,1.5493,9.6326,10.892,3.3139,2.1719,5.1446,6.5158,8.1033,2.0153,12.569,3.2791,4.0771,6.3724,4.8071,4.2164,3.4548,0.8898,4.7925,0.4695,8.1071,1.2511,8.674,7.1118,3.8769,2.5441,1.3538,0.2704,3.136,6.0288,7.3746,6.36,5.5338,6.9678,1.613,1.1256,5.8697,2.351,4.2286,3.5178,3.5025,4.7222,0.738,2.0108,0.6841,5.8916,0.9276,5.2694,6.9104,1.3031,4.05,0.7548,4.3608,4.8426,3.3043,1.1303,3.5302,5.9352,4.5865,6.5537,0.5077,0.2169,3.2224,5.7669,2.6358,3.4755,0.0029,1.56,4.1949,3.3527,1.6322,2.6619,1.7564,1.6451,1.3996,0.0075,3.0652,3.6387,0.1856,4.5693,2.987,1.0676,4.2285,3.021,5.1034,0.0129,2.4106,6.7435,4.1131,1.6764,1.5424,4.2914,2.1908,1.7094,6.0849,2.2976,0.0127,4.3958,4.8435,3.894,5.2372,3.1106,3.2559,3.7904,10.748,5.7005,3.1236,2.1428,11.5675,1.8254,1.1788,0.0156,0.9361,0.6797,0.0712,10.8304,2.0424,4.0622,1.5121,0.016,0.0001,0.0001,0.0007,0.5387,1.0051,2.3035,3.8052,0.975,6.5088,0.4271,0.9249,7.4152,0.1388,6.6641,5.8546,6.8654,2.4094,2.071,0.3733,0.0072,0.0001,0.0018,0.0056,1.1785,1.8912,1.7027,2.8002,5.0042,9.1071,4.5263,5.6779,0.7759,0.2143,0.0172,4.0488,0.0599,0.7621,1.9751,1.0231,5.159,4.195,1.6589,0.0187,3.9895,0.1375,1.3165,2.6503,0.7049,1.259,2.7859,0.7551,6.8945,1.5938,2.4538,4.6802,3.1834,0.0805,5.3975,4.3093,9.2303,2.2176,1.5674,4.3386,7.9545,1.6568,9.6312,2.294,3.7918,3.2225,3.2417,1.3151,3.2405,7.9298,5.704,2.7596,1.1131,0.6216,2.6072,4.6766,5.4762,5.2668,3.2328,0.7742,1.7385,4.3236,6.5019,0.9876,2.2738,0.9658,2.3952,3.8068,0.4456,0.9851,0.0002,1.8299,4.0977,2.0761,0.1085,2.0282,3.8399,0.6425,0.3533,2.8463,3.0996,3.1188,0.0652,0.0333,1.6971,1.2716,3.1702,0.0146,6.8303,4.2709,2.407,2.2298,3.5678,0.6035,0.8213,3.5188,0.2728,1.8529,0.6931,6.0842,1.2388,1.984,5.5225,2.3353,0.9607,4.1786,1.1751,4.3595,0.8755,0.0152,2.7211,2.6578,0.0001,6.0415,1.2501,5.8102,1.369,2.6603,0.0724,4.8602,0.1353,4.8485,0.222,0.8983,2.0713,1.082,8.168,8.4344,4.4107,6.7618,0.3388,3.16,5.2192,0.9035,0.0682,11.209,1.592,0.0988,2.2289,6.5388,3.5151,0.421,4.3587,1.8048,2.0352,4.0513,0.6624,8.1703,7.0416,3.3697,8.4208,2.2388,2.3851,0.8193,1.4709,3.9227,4.9006,1.4209,3.059,4.0059,1.7245,5.6456,4.496,7.8058,3.7694,11.3862,1.9639,6.5184,5.7926,1.2699,0.6484,1.2165,1.7105,0.9688,1.463,3.6731,7.9459,5.0382,1.3683,2.4995,4.1207,0.0487,0.7462,0.4316,4.3948,5.2072,0.4719,0.1266,1.3421,2.6644,0.5776,7.0319,0.5113,7.9298,0.3749,4.3315,3.2288,1.0339,7.8888,0.0966,0.0506,3.2027,0.7067,9.7737,0.0005,0.0165,0.0087,0.0025,0.0004,0.0075,0.9301,0.7336,1.3713,2.7555,0.1772,2.2,0.3262,3.0357,2.7627,0.0836,0.0122,0.0048,2.9633,0.0055,0.7285,0.0017,0.8212,0.9601,0.0002,5.4618,0.7874,1.3984,1.4481,0.0365,1.5806,9.8756,0.1413,1.86,4.0141,6.0886,0.7867,5.7233,6.7536,2.4123,0.6042,5.6867,0.0578,6.4852,0.5324,2.3435,6.1641,2.0725,9.1436,0.0056,0.0,0.0008,0.9631,0.9159,1.6786,4.7481,3.3733,3.9329,4.3853,2.1424,2.986,1.6184,2.3515,3.3201,3.8617,4.4095,1.5925,4.5577,0.5284,1.4848,0.0002,1.0719,3.5863,0.0767,4.5339,0.8285,2.4759,0.7067,2.7231,0.0158,0.2216,0.7169,0.2889,1.2553,1.8775,0.5948,1.2576,0.018,4.3082,0.0241,0.724,2.8204,1.0617,1.9311,0.0023,0.0004,0.0024,0.2422,6.6366,0.4687,0.3183,0.0356,7.478,0.6446,7.5795,0.0681,0.2892,0.3124,0.2274,8.4332,3.469,5.0977,0.0926,7.4577,1.7228,0.6199,1.0176,5.6035,0.0412,1.1101,1.8466,2.9603,0.6996,7.1864,2.7353,1.3923,1.3264,8.6426,0.3189,0.3795,3.5058,0.0251,0.1458,1.4943,0.5727,1.326,0.0002,3.7185]}
{"id":1398,"ended":true,"length":441,"text":"The first long segment of Interstate 80 in Nebraska to be opened was a fifty @ - @ mile section between Dodge Street in Omaha and the West Lincoln interchange in 1961. Construction of Interstate 80 began on March 30, 1957. Although work stopped during much of the summer, the first complete mile of the new highway was opened to traffic on November 27, 1962, with a ceremony that included \"Miss I 80\" being presented her official sash. The new highway was not a smooth ride, because the original surface was in serious need of repair.\n\nThis mile of I-80, like the entire section of highway, was opened with a ribbon cutting and grand opening ceremony.\n\nOn November 9, 1958, the first traffic on I-80 in Nebraska came from a convoy of seven Ford Custom Sedans. The first cars on the new highway were a mix of old Ford and Oldsmobile model years. By the end of the first month, more than 1,200 vehicles used the new route.\n\nDuring the first few months of use, all of the original pavement was badly deteriorated. Repairs were made, with the exception of patches made at each interchange.\n\nThe first bridge and approaches to the bridge over the Missouri River, between Fremont and Columbus, were opened on October 2, 1959. The bridge was actually in use in February of 1960.\n\nBecause of the large number of new interchanges, the interchange at South 27th Street was not completed and therefore, traffic had to exit onto North 27th Street and then turn onto Interstate 80 onto South 27th Street. Because of this, at rush hour both north- and south-bound lanes traveled the same distance. The construction of the new interchange at South 27th Street and Interstate 80 was made a priority. The new interchange opened on August 24, 1961.\n\nAlso during the first year, the interstate carried about 250,000 vehicles per day - about double what it is carrying today.\n\nThe construction of the interstate continued for the next twenty years. By 1972, eight miles of the interstate were completed, between North 27th Street and North 70th Street.\n\nIn the next few years, four more miles of Interstate 80 were completed between North 70th Street and the South 30th Street Interchange. The freeway was actually open to traffic in November of 1975, just prior to Nebraska's bicentennial celebration.","token_len":486,"entropy":[5.3423,8.0358,9.3476,0.9664,10.2756,3.2445,2.8392,6.4192,5.5752,1.3834,3.3711,2.6539,2.9893,9.3981,15.3584,7.3058,4.6472,1.7943,6.0176,4.3959,7.5286,6.3592,3.7542,2.8963,0.2208,2.1379,5.5385,5.9069,8.6889,1.764,11.6416,0.2141,5.8424,1.7935,2.4004,0.2283,1.3117,2.7772,2.9604,3.7484,0.0471,4.2359,0.8768,6.0647,6.0245,6.7546,3.5883,8.3523,0.0213,0.3802,4.206,1.5955,1.174,3.3619,5.6669,4.9573,1.9164,0.874,2.7447,1.291,0.8537,3.2223,4.3259,0.8503,1.0336,3.3672,3.9163,0.038,2.995,2.1328,2.6998,1.763,7.9343,3.3615,2.1954,5.4603,6.9681,6.682,8.5563,1.0684,4.3748,3.3844,10.4457,5.8988,8.2023,2.7281,0.9041,1.8842,3.1143,0.8846,1.1523,5.3052,3.5998,6.0904,3.3665,0.9877,6.0281,1.8676,5.3845,6.7114,1.3662,4.8808,5.6343,2.7274,0.0467,1.313,0.7621,2.9118,0.0263,4.2693,5.0296,2.4789,2.8789,0.1402,0.0126,3.2043,4.602,1.392,5.0574,3.2138,0.7559,2.8096,1.2179,0.9804,4.9412,3.575,1.5621,4.1555,1.419,2.763,6.844,0.242,1.4346,2.6598,2.3536,0.0004,4.0736,2.5861,3.9785,0.0621,4.1701,0.1724,1.2138,1.9337,5.5599,5.2576,1.252,0.0156,0.0091,3.5297,1.2652,4.8564,1.5034,3.9386,5.9664,0.2572,5.1911,4.8793,8.1904,6.9294,0.266,1.4459,1.4261,2.4665,4.3022,2.3487,0.848,3.9289,0.4599,0.5861,3.0505,6.6946,0.0677,5.1201,2.9369,2.1272,6.9414,0.1193,0.019,5.3584,6.3673,0.6293,5.208,1.1195,1.1751,0.0232,0.8803,3.293,2.7044,1.44,3.5558,0.1202,2.9515,0.0647,2.3296,1.3035,6.1042,0.6665,1.3234,4.4873,0.5521,1.2547,0.0003,3.8697,0.4572,1.6871,3.1941,0.8953,0.3072,5.671,0.8061,4.9024,2.1986,0.2309,4.5485,5.6971,0.9337,7.2143,2.6123,1.1852,8.7228,0.0617,0.9396,1.4209,2.3983,4.359,1.7151,2.7263,0.0149,7.9134,4.6532,3.8499,5.3355,3.522,1.2723,2.0208,0.0003,1.6362,2.1234,5.9638,4.3727,10.6231,0.5998,1.1224,4.7575,3.8063,1.0227,3.4426,0.0846,2.8918,4.4006,8.3137,0.0142,0.4659,7.5557,0.7936,1.0882,3.0759,1.2401,2.4184,3.3912,0.0497,1.6812,0.3429,1.4082,1.9277,1.2748,6.9304,4.4095,2.0167,3.1498,4.6085,1.4469,1.6378,0.9035,0.9877,0.0002,6.8061,0.4263,0.5976,3.6924,0.7623,0.0145,2.4745,6.6672,1.689,1.0918,1.4056,5.2783,3.8324,5.2606,8.8891,0.1369,0.3692,1.4682,3.5337,3.378,6.0271,6.1069,2.8237,4.2235,4.3337,0.1361,6.6121,4.7779,3.7588,1.7701,0.0028,0.1953,3.0798,3.5312,4.0208,3.198,4.0703,1.068,7.0359,2.5968,0.3605,0.0017,0.1728,0.3821,5.3104,0.3597,1.4936,0.3575,5.4994,7.6102,0.0402,6.1726,4.0017,5.0798,3.489,0.0267,0.1334,0.8721,2.4824,5.4424,3.6767,0.5458,2.6959,0.991,2.2306,6.0306,0.2105,0.8576,1.3976,2.5132,2.6031,0.594,0.0306,0.0011,0.1334,3.1031,3.1033,0.052,1.6065,5.0236,4.1061,3.3938,1.2447,2.5005,2.0077,1.7028,3.1802,1.4409,2.8977,3.5941,0.0247,1.7811,0.6707,0.4141,0.0002,5.9951,2.3203,0.4447,1.4016,2.9212,1.6789,1.5345,3.9033,8.3053,2.642,4.438,0.8256,0.0055,1.3199,2.5166,0.293,5.1489,2.19,4.4159,2.1137,0.7827,3.8539,10.3428,0.1901,0.1603,1.3422,0.0003,1.5917,4.8662,0.1184,0.7519,2.3752,4.8736,2.3957,1.7399,0.6724,4.5294,0.3447,0.7763,3.3163,4.2963,0.2215,6.9339,1.9044,0.1003,1.4336,1.932,0.6106,1.8539,1.5832,7.1339,3.6585,4.1484,0.0022,0.351,0.1437,2.0491,6.2566,0.0049,0.1723,0.5493,1.4443,0.0003,2.3867,2.0069,3.6135,2.4699,0.1415,0.1377,5.4548,2.7979,0.1832,0.1751,2.7001,0.0766,0.3651,1.416,2.7175,1.1388,2.9734,0.0012,0.1805,0.0599,3.904,3.1481,4.8741,0.0133,0.1217,4.6199,0.498,0.4359,1.9629,5.1787,1.4977,6.1079,5.0387,1.1805,0.4759,2.6048,4.1109,1.0847,3.51,1.229,4.3563,3.4175,0.006,7.3618,0.8528,8.0673,0.0237,0.0249,2.9992,0.7053]}
{"id":3546,"ended":true,"length":455,"text":"The height of horses is usually measured at the highest point of the withers, where the neck meets the back. This point is used because it is a stable point of the anatomy, and not on the neck where the action of bending the neck may cause the measure to change. It is therefore important to take care not to measure above this point, but to take the measurement as high up the back as possible ( see more here ).\n\nThis website provides information not only on the height at the withers, but also, in some countries, at the fetlocks and at the shoulder girth.\n\nIt makes it possible for you to check how high the horse is at any point if you like. The height at the withers will determine if the measurement is done as on horseback or as near as possible on the ground - there is no good reason to measure the height on the ground.\n\nThe picture above shows a comparison between the wither measurement on a horse and that on a person, as both use the natural place where the horse's neck meets the back as the point to measure. The wither measurement is therefore always higher or lower on horseback - unless the rider applies pressure on the back ( see more here ). It is therefore advisable to take the measurement where possible on the ground, but do check what type of measurement is better ( see this article ).\n\nAt the shoulder girth, although this appears to be close to the wither measurement, it is actually higher on the horse. This is because the natural way that the horse hoofs are positioned when walking is lower on the leg that the front ( see more here ). On the ground, the height from the centre of the horse's back to the highest point of the withers will be higher than if you measure from the actual place where the horse's neck meets the back.\n\nYou will find the height at the withers, and the height at the shoulder girth, of horses on this page, which also gives you a simple method to calculate how high the horse is at different points.\n\nIt is important to remember that taking a horse's height above the withers ( as in the example above ) is not as exact as measuring the height at the withers itself ; it is more like taking the average of the height of an animal ( rather than measuring it ).","token_len":487,"entropy":[9.2396,0.3415,11.5651,1.6655,4.6688,3.1795,2.2771,2.1595,5.6845,0.4399,1.1115,0.4548,7.1936,2.5352,1.3237,1.2252,3.5206,1.0422,6.0745,6.007,0.1683,3.5277,1.9705,2.7079,5.3415,0.6856,4.8161,5.5533,2.472,0.9023,3.1497,5.9797,1.5648,2.879,2.1375,9.4131,1.7009,1.2611,5.1164,4.6644,0.7031,4.3205,4.0973,0.5791,7.2207,1.1001,7.0245,0.8934,0.497,3.7729,2.4486,1.3006,11.3628,0.7408,3.6895,0.4496,3.1722,0.406,3.9874,2.9282,0.4671,3.8185,2.5531,1.4031,0.0024,5.5978,5.6634,1.3617,0.2711,1.2681,3.2769,1.2472,2.7022,1.6768,2.5389,3.1359,3.9315,5.0478,2.3171,2.5932,0.276,0.4486,4.9081,9.6404,7.1049,2.196,0.655,0.8567,0.1359,3.8979,9.2096,3.1641,2.0653,6.0375,0.8716,1.1356,1.4437,4.1308,5.6206,2.5077,2.2178,0.0032,0.5301,0.4253,0.0508,0.1251,5.1606,2.7575,1.3058,4.0089,0.1667,4.7156,0.4005,10.5154,4.9918,2.9888,2.9297,0.3797,5.6514,5.5853,4.5976,0.8936,1.3483,0.0002,4.267,6.4029,2.4131,1.6167,1.8349,2.5623,0.069,4.2977,4.1479,3.2971,1.2704,3.2324,1.0686,2.2293,1.8116,1.8408,5.3671,0.527,5.7303,0.6895,2.6799,2.5172,1.7942,0.3252,0.2543,0.0013,0.1102,3.6265,3.5652,2.999,0.9194,3.7257,0.6085,5.5643,4.0222,5.6709,4.336,0.1883,1.2443,2.1318,5.0605,1.097,0.5941,3.8985,0.9231,2.6582,6.0004,4.7052,0.955,0.8657,5.7858,1.2649,0.9398,2.5945,2.4301,1.5276,3.3442,2.0563,0.3917,1.4204,0.8054,0.0002,2.0869,6.3365,1.7091,0.3651,1.6905,4.778,1.7755,0.6472,4.5104,0.0054,7.5549,2.467,2.0826,1.0404,0.442,2.0782,1.4051,0.3708,4.4589,2.5185,2.9694,5.2771,5.1739,1.1515,10.4902,6.7471,2.2811,0.5281,2.3273,3.1039,1.4401,0.5426,0.1479,0.4658,4.8398,1.7617,3.0583,4.4198,1.3458,0.6972,1.7376,3.5054,0.0027,0.6208,1.3166,4.7089,4.4416,3.8352,4.3904,0.2409,2.5225,2.8436,0.0279,3.6035,5.1363,1.2048,4.2418,7.8471,3.4106,1.4805,0.217,2.1542,3.8975,3.7884,1.9611,0.3481,0.3689,4.096,0.5402,2.6809,3.5993,0.3694,2.0782,0.9037,1.5386,4.5248,3.2393,2.1883,0.7951,0.3088,1.2654,2.7447,3.5491,7.408,4.456,4.9352,0.0292,4.3495,1.4427,6.4066,2.9339,2.7089,4.0954,2.3495,0.9369,0.2933,0.0002,5.5137,0.6267,3.8663,0.1757,0.0023,0.9044,6.6312,3.858,7.9942,0.3049,0.1746,7.1542,0.3195,0.4618,3.8935,0.0035,0.5268,0.4828,0.9886,0.4544,2.5122,4.1012,2.2424,1.6266,0.7245,1.5225,2.1293,0.6483,0.4177,0.6816,6.56,4.5766,4.0978,0.4507,1.4259,7.5724,3.9734,0.4028,2.5829,3.7519,4.5038,4.0563,1.2863,6.4786,1.9618,0.1468,6.4003,6.0813,2.513,4.6661,5.7564,8.026,1.6918,0.3013,0.6539,4.2494,0.7551,3.9588,0.4607,1.0992,4.0982,5.8098,0.3756,6.8358,0.2206,0.1614,3.189,0.4232,1.8922,0.7813,0.121,5.8523,0.051,0.5851,0.2188,0.6579,0.003,1.2428,3.0751,1.3022,3.2229,1.4042,4.4102,3.9409,4.6177,2.5043,0.3933,8.7151,3.3865,0.4171,0.1351,0.8101,0.8014,0.4074,0.2705,0.067,0.2022,0.5925,0.8311,0.0002,4.5745,2.2939,1.9594,2.417,2.8351,1.2256,0.1357,0.5462,0.001,0.1485,3.6086,2.5749,0.9706,2.0905,0.7133,0.1346,0.8111,0.1345,0.0011,0.7332,4.4718,1.2942,2.1166,4.1118,2.1294,2.0603,3.8586,4.1812,2.6613,2.3271,1.3249,4.811,4.2857,1.4269,2.588,3.1165,0.9365,0.5891,0.3572,0.3129,0.8305,5.8472,0.4087,2.1102,0.6986,0.0002,3.8998,0.5268,1.9801,0.2872,2.1066,0.2276,6.912,1.8534,1.5383,0.6095,0.3382,3.7438,0.476,1.6154,0.0018,0.2277,3.5302,4.8541,3.0233,0.6632,3.0571,0.3168,0.6846,1.2263,1.2224,4.1299,5.527,0.1454,2.3236,1.4199,0.6196,1.3837,0.1689,0.6799,0.0007,0.0599,5.3839,8.0902,1.8313,0.7762,2.1984,2.5616,2.1756,1.1965,4.6544,1.3353,0.753,1.8545,1.6578,3.2173,2.5055,2.7127,6.2901,0.0662,3.1803,1.7515,2.481]}

They had a displacement of 5,300 tons. They operated with a complement of around 1,100 officers and men. They carried 1,300 tons of gasoline, 500 tons of fuel oil, and 160 tons of aviation fuel. The ships were fitted with a 12,500 hp ( 9.4 MW ) triple-expansion steam engine, which was capable of propelling the ships at a speed of 31 knots ( 38 km\/h ). The engines were installed in a V-shape arrangement, with the propellers set close together on the foreship. The arrangement allowed for very close quarters between the engines and the propulsion shaft to allow for the space required to house the engines and shaft drive machinery. As the propellers were a fair distance apart the ship's hull was shaped like that of a football.\n\nThe ships were equipped with a system of hydraulic rams which were used to propel the ships independently of power from the engines. The rams took up all the space available on the rear deck of the bow and were set at 90 degree angles.\n\nThe Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class were armed with six.25 mm (. 9 in ) caliber machine guns mounted on swiveling mounts. They were also equipped with a secondary armament of two twin 7.92 mm ( 0. 3 in ) caliber machine guns mounted abreast of the upper funnel on each of the sides of the conning tower. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by a pair of single 40 mm ( 1.57 in ) caliber automatic guns. The Ammiraglio di Saint Bon was the only ship of this class to have had these armament configurations.\n\nThe Ammiraglio di Saint Bon carried up to 1,000 tons of cargo aboard her. When fully loaded she could carry up to 500 of her complement of 1,100 aboard.\n\nThe ships of the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class were equipped with an ASDIC system. This meant that in the event of a Soviet attack on one of the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon's sister vessels the ship could be directed to the source of the threat and would be provided with a precise location of the threat without having to transmit radio signals.","token_len":489,"entropy":[9.9603,2.6769,0.8967,6.9676,6.7487,9.5052,8.3605,7.9768,6.2475,6.2916,18.1646,2.09,11.2239,4.3271,2.3753,14.7522,1.1598,1.7567,0.6135,4.5993,0.6455,7.7008,1.4825,1.3618,6.0671,15.0223,6.2057,9.7406,5.4474,4.0764,1.0406,10.42,0.0123,0.1773,1.4497,8.0815,0.437,2.7049,2.4703,1.5287,4.1806,0.11,3.3884,1.2887,3.9027,0.348,1.6879,2.6311,6.1656,3.1195,1.5972,6.4403,0.04,5.8938,2.5698,0.0425,2.7958,4.6236,1.205,2.9691,0.6043,2.4584,3.2878,4.3738,0.1251,3.0585,1.8438,0.3184,6.4428,1.2041,4.9434,0.418,0.0475,2.786,4.0163,0.4301,1.654,5.9587,0.1168,0.0171,5.7064,0.7383,0.3964,1.6781,2.7125,0.9142,5.0657,0.0467,1.8137,5.5811,2.6943,2.3632,3.2732,1.1025,4.3293,4.1067,2.297,5.9075,0.8276,7.7192,1.2453,8.9857,0.9727,3.4264,0.5937,1.6646,2.2838,1.4666,2.8131,0.0048,8.8507,0.0077,1.6107,2.4266,2.4747,1.8086,0.6906,0.1002,6.595,0.9024,1.0199,5.4265,2.3478,0.1541,0.0292,3.4944,1.1705,2.1631,0.7241,4.5618,1.1272,2.6001,7.0613,0.651,3.3428,6.7593,1.6668,1.3184,1.309,4.7974,0.6116,4.8013,6.5622,0.8603,3.0569,0.8982,3.591,7.5999,1.3351,0.7704,7.7574,2.8544,1.2403,5.0514,5.3847,4.5385,5.2708,0.3188,2.0357,1.3562,0.4891,5.038,4.0074,4.8789,2.2342,1.0397,2.3305,8.2152,3.5544,1.2833,6.5953,0.75,2.2511,2.258,7.8221,8.0467,5.6391,0.3025,4.795,1.073,4.277,0.4376,0.7539,5.8796,6.9496,2.2729,0.5902,2.6324,3.1887,1.6528,3.8936,0.8429,5.7463,1.8663,3.2504,0.0771,0.3885,4.6203,1.6994,2.8786,0.0654,1.0837,3.0704,0.8262,2.0646,0.0166,1.3652,6.2774,0.3557,3.898,5.5814,3.0358,2.834,1.7567,3.2832,0.3754,2.9966,0.2999,1.4509,7.6335,1.169,6.8336,4.1761,0.3442,2.3994,0.3509,0.9023,1.7958,0.0033,6.2348,2.1181,4.7106,0.9104,3.5231,3.135,2.1376,0.1972,5.4749,1.045,1.3527,0.0717,6.2294,1.5861,2.2705,4.8119,2.3944,4.9862,3.2917,0.1638,2.8359,3.3843,0.0002,0.8966,2.9187,0.0569,0.0203,0.0063,0.5322,0.0402,0.0235,0.1298,2.5736,3.9094,0.0518,4.38,6.8734,5.8283,1.888,5.8979,9.7839,3.7815,0.5781,3.6406,2.2978,0.1631,4.3201,0.4879,9.6088,0.1668,3.9258,4.7651,0.9854,2.4695,0.8819,3.1796,0.6398,0.0035,1.2967,6.1249,3.9217,0.0496,2.4244,3.614,8.1371,3.9832,0.1946,5.4363,0.1726,0.93,4.0853,0.0309,5.8849,0.0572,0.0446,1.729,0.5776,0.0724,1.4004,11.4356,1.0278,0.0008,2.5571,0.234,5.1232,9.8459,3.9252,1.9858,3.2069,0.1132,3.5081,0.429,0.0821,8.4338,1.8396,0.7114,0.4832,9.0542,0.0658,0.7305,0.0158,6.7245,1.0528,1.8742,0.6047,1.391,3.718,0.0073,5.4162,6.2788,0.219,0.5732,2.245,0.1822,6.0725,0.0249,0.0246,2.176,4.3654,1.7265,2.0878,1.0579,4.5092,0.0034,0.0046,0.0056,0.2089,0.0176,0.0016,4.4334,4.0964,1.5945,1.5448,2.2831,2.0291,0.3719,0.6046,0.9245,5.7106,6.0636,5.3985,0.3843,6.6735,0.606,0.8069,0.0002,0.8658,2.0556,0.0027,0.0054,0.004,0.0918,0.0183,0.0017,6.8492,5.1175,0.0035,2.7575,0.0402,1.9362,0.7401,0.144,2.8379,4.8732,4.8335,1.1467,5.0502,4.6444,0.547,2.1558,2.439,0.5575,1.5505,0.0029,3.5105,6.0458,3.1897,7.7579,0.4866,2.2602,0.0034,2.1459,7.3887,0.733,1.9734,0.0002,1.0341,2.6262,1.9356,0.0856,0.564,0.0024,0.0063,0.0026,0.0419,0.0177,0.0013,0.1741,0.5455,1.537,0.0068,3.0431,13.1308,7.0224,4.6447,2.1451,1.9129,6.0509,0.1174,4.2792,2.4862,0.483,0.1863,0.9347,5.8429,0.6683,1.511,3.1839,0.1275,0.3225,2.9399,0.0256,0.0092,0.0932,0.3224,0.0645,0.0023,1.5593,5.8322,2.9532,2.355,2.3723,1.0086,1.4606,6.9295,0.4363,2.8578,8.2557,0.2183,0.4356,5.1305,1.8079,3.6635,1.5791,5.3949,0.2248,1.5804,7.2925,3.0369,2.4918,0.4527,3.9767,4.3552,1.5207,0.0162,8.0025,5.6003,1.0556,1.0591]}

{"id":3522,"ended":true,"length":470,"text":"Greeley resumed the editorship of the Tribune, but quickly learned there was a movement under way to unseat him. He found himself unable to sleep, and after a final visit to the doctor, spent the next two days in his room, unable to work. Then on Christmas, the mayor of Chicago, James J. Thompson, called a special session of the city council.\n\nIn spite of the editor's illness, Greeley did manage to send his Christmas Day editorial to the newspaper printers. Later that evening, he died from heart disease at 43.\n\nThis is one of my favourite times and I enjoy every occasion of it. I am glad we do not have to depend upon any man ; and when we turn from the business of the last year and begin thinking of the coming one, we feel not only secure, but very happy in the fact of its being a new year.\n\nIn a few minutes after the New Year we will be standing under our own trees with candles burning and our children will be singing our New Year's carol. It will be one of the pleasantest times of life that can be passed in peace.\n\nI know that some of you have not had your work for the coming year completed ; but the Christmas holidays have been a rest and a relaxation for you ; and the next few days will be as well spent as you can possibly make them. Then you will have plenty of time before the work starts to get things in order ; and perhaps when you look back after a few weeks it will not appear as though you have been idle ; for when you turn your eyes from the present to the future, the present seems to have no beginning and the future no end.\n\nSo we start this coming year, and with the old year we leave off this. But if you keep your first step towards the coming year faithfully, you will make your future years all that we would wish them to be ; for what we cannot see yet, is that the years of life come to us in one great whole.\n\nThis is the first of my Christmas addresses. If any of you desire to be informed of something of my public affairs, write for one of my circulars. Also if any of you are members of what are called clubs or social meetings, I would like to add that there would be time enough for the presentation of an opinion of the governor at these gatherings.","token_len":490,"entropy":[9.1932,6.5196,10.8476,2.6731,9.8084,2.4797,0.4998,0.9829,7.3689,2.1251,2.4164,5.9864,5.8951,4.8502,0.6752,1.4859,8.2055,4.7286,0.5695,1.159,5.858,0.9331,1.8838,0.5435,2.3677,5.5645,1.2129,3.7884,0.0396,8.8835,1.9396,0.8985,4.2503,1.7726,6.3715,5.5635,0.347,1.3581,4.5605,1.096,8.2219,1.1418,1.1712,2.0936,0.9625,1.6616,3.1639,2.3347,1.5963,3.6183,0.0176,3.6996,0.8399,5.0818,2.7355,5.6798,3.443,3.2424,6.4921,1.5471,4.5092,1.0306,4.489,4.0115,0.0435,5.9989,0.0797,3.4992,3.4449,2.5056,2.0191,0.4961,0.2244,2.0739,0.778,1.8744,2.734,0.001,2.783,5.2703,0.0059,1.2058,7.5084,0.4002,8.6948,0.1762,8.0512,0.0016,3.7227,3.1862,0.0619,6.3712,2.3053,7.666,6.8531,4.5047,0.8807,0.7517,3.4728,11.8516,1.0552,5.9673,1.0001,3.4018,0.1689,1.4973,6.6885,2.8288,3.8199,2.2733,2.3185,6.3737,0.4819,0.7463,0.0003,4.9308,2.2131,3.0196,0.2676,4.3813,3.8782,5.584,6.7836,2.3322,6.7589,2.9297,8.3563,1.8978,1.028,0.2788,1.8582,2.8695,4.174,4.9804,4.7597,0.2577,0.7738,0.4605,7.2621,2.6352,4.0572,4.9268,10.0728,2.313,3.8428,1.5397,7.7953,4.3175,1.4829,4.559,0.335,2.0832,6.0514,2.7944,3.2224,3.6282,6.5442,0.7547,1.7379,5.7857,5.8628,0.335,1.5153,5.2336,5.5167,1.1493,8.1479,1.3097,0.1174,3.8976,1.9925,3.8668,1.4863,2.6844,3.0119,5.24,2.6945,2.9055,4.096,2.1109,0.7293,0.9147,0.0003,3.4668,3.4764,2.7095,3.2953,4.282,1.6868,5.3854,0.209,4.4583,1.4901,1.9488,5.4834,4.7651,4.6798,2.9041,3.0564,3.8354,4.6238,2.6971,2.4503,3.3656,3.3,6.0586,1.0785,2.591,3.4752,5.2974,0.2228,0.2063,7.2075,3.6393,0.9837,3.2082,1.5202,0.3612,4.3869,0.4822,0.4055,6.5857,0.3145,2.9785,0.507,5.0454,4.8087,4.2427,0.6608,7.283,2.9862,4.8484,0.6779,0.5717,0.0003,2.4751,3.5994,1.4275,3.5691,1.2033,0.2921,1.8146,4.2468,3.5172,3.452,6.7503,4.9751,3.2681,8.3406,0.6259,5.7097,5.0544,1.0108,3.5734,5.4375,4.7974,2.2075,1.6156,1.8615,9.1169,2.2755,1.1042,4.7965,2.2841,1.2519,3.1669,0.5646,3.1202,4.4093,2.5998,0.9097,0.8808,0.6984,3.7057,4.713,1.0561,0.4439,2.6193,2.2739,2.6185,4.0667,0.7088,0.4107,6.9803,2.1395,0.6884,1.7274,4.3075,0.5519,0.6426,5.7009,1.5302,4.7256,3.1436,2.1901,2.5581,7.8795,3.5974,0.0767,2.5088,0.4613,4.9691,3.9917,1.0976,4.9672,1.0568,6.1539,3.0022,1.2729,1.9454,4.1256,0.1997,3.6208,5.9846,2.1529,1.5214,0.9496,1.4795,1.8014,4.429,3.9985,1.3177,4.2658,0.8884,4.6657,1.9706,2.4748,1.6212,0.8002,4.4509,0.7582,0.2806,0.4956,0.6309,2.728,2.8239,5.2708,0.5659,2.3715,3.8468,3.8455,2.0115,3.4776,0.4208,2.8486,0.3178,0.2485,0.3952,0.0003,4.4892,3.7891,6.4486,3.865,6.3843,0.5648,2.9716,0.9692,3.8816,2.3285,5.6619,3.4269,4.2149,5.3391,2.8259,4.4797,5.2725,3.1753,3.0753,0.9012,5.6662,1.9761,7.5926,5.8338,4.6313,1.3924,3.6586,0.6228,8.7094,0.8985,1.1614,0.4752,4.0558,2.7725,5.0283,3.8775,4.9289,3.8951,4.3141,5.2341,3.2101,2.1798,0.1502,0.6457,3.1462,1.8663,4.2657,1.7499,5.0519,3.5838,5.1178,1.1757,3.0502,2.1795,1.852,4.3052,1.922,3.2438,5.2151,1.0469,1.7139,2.2973,4.3558,3.2962,7.3528,1.0486,0.5701,0.0003,4.0507,1.1003,1.4807,2.8388,2.1933,3.1637,2.9167,7.3562,1.4244,4.5062,4.3242,0.9922,0.0652,5.5729,0.7152,3.211,4.0226,0.5181,5.7983,3.0693,1.5773,6.3643,4.2837,0.288,5.3403,5.8424,6.2137,0.0508,0.9569,11.2393,0.3417,1.2752,5.5166,2.5125,2.719,0.4917,0.0369,2.5593,7.4359,0.042,7.3808,2.911,0.4986,6.7819,1.9558,5.554,4.178,0.3073,2.7992,1.6359,1.0796,0.2115,4.4067,1.0928,3.2852,4.7395,0.1614,5.4936,5.5644,0.6097,3.2171,7.6865,0.0915,4.6004,4.3729,3.2885,1.9024,10.5732,4.2265,2.8787,3.071,0.8117]}
{"id":4274,"ended":true,"length":468,"text":"Canada as a nation is religiously diverse, encompassing a wide range of groups, beliefs and customs. The preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms references `` God ``, and the Canadian Human Rights Act, as well as the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, all assert a right ``to have and receive `` religious education \u00bb. It is important to note that Canada does not have an official state religion, nor does official state funding go directly to the religious establishment.\n\nThe official state church, the Roman Catholic Church, holds very special status in our country. This is significant for two reasons.\n\nFirst, it is often perceived that our country is deeply religious, and so the support by Catholic institutions of religious education is naturally important. Second, because the Catholic Church is the official state church, religious institutions cannot be accused of discrimination because there is no public provision for religious education outside their sphere. Any private schools which offer religious education must be recognized under the rules for non-profit and public schools in Canada, and have a charter which affords all citizens the full protection of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nHowever, there are other official state religions which have constitutional standing and must be accommodated. Both the Anglican and Lutheran churches are legally recognized, and both enjoy constitutional protection. The United Church, which is not part of the Anglican Church, has also been granted constitutional protection. Our government has the statutory power to make various provisions for these official state religions, notably to provide financial assistance and educational opportunities for their members.\n\nIt is important to note that the official state religions have no direct statutory authority to discriminate against anyone who chooses not to be part of the group. The state cannot coerce anyone to join a state religion, and the member of any of the official state religions has complete freedom of choice as to whether to join or not to join. These governments are responsible to the people of each country for the actions performed by their personnel, and they must comply with the laws of the country.\n\nMost importantly, it is important that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is respected, and that all citizens are entitled to the same protection which it grants to the official state religions. Even where churches do not benefit directly through the provisions for aid to religious institutions in the charter, individuals benefit and members must enjoy the same protection as do members of recognized official state religions.","token_len":490,"entropy":[5.4306,1.2001,4.115,3.3826,11.832,3.5404,1.0616,7.4042,0.0052,2.128,1.5777,0.5035,0.0183,5.427,1.1933,4.1924,0.6091,4.756,0.728,2.4292,8.0683,3.0447,0.0014,0.8067,0.475,6.3,0.9867,0.2691,0.0674,0.0167,0.0027,0.0,7.8308,11.1213,13.8272,7.888,1.8974,1.7232,1.7036,3.4593,2.7722,0.2982,0.5396,2.5807,3.1586,1.1068,0.0055,0.8845,2.2436,1.3162,0.0981,0.2996,0.0138,0.3672,0.0003,0.6665,4.1196,8.3295,2.9769,2.0596,5.9505,1.1367,4.0109,2.918,4.1581,8.9745,2.6228,3.8894,12.5437,2.0854,4.0517,1.439,2.544,0.319,0.3705,0.2231,3.923,2.4756,0.0499,1.3326,2.347,2.9374,5.1186,0.4495,1.1064,1.9342,0.6005,10.5254,1.6545,8.7432,6.006,3.3325,0.1954,1.9583,1.993,4.3092,0.5609,2.4911,0.0036,1.7433,5.7333,1.0575,5.7268,2.6849,1.8281,4.771,0.0108,0.2928,0.7336,4.8032,6.295,4.1838,3.1861,0.6553,3.9885,1.39,0.6409,3.7031,1.3611,5.821,2.6749,1.1109,0.0742,0.4587,3.316,0.0002,0.3795,0.0367,2.017,0.9497,5.0138,4.2913,1.3523,4.0851,2.8913,0.8745,5.6281,1.7096,1.2621,0.9958,4.3511,2.8548,6.7636,5.3409,4.1139,3.9016,2.119,2.4908,3.2889,1.3016,8.2183,4.3044,0.8678,3.271,0.01,4.2494,2.0181,1.6797,0.3745,1.2781,2.3554,2.426,0.7844,0.9178,1.1705,3.9641,2.4451,4.951,1.3254,4.0888,0.0502,3.1727,3.1614,5.0009,0.3916,0.5023,4.2144,6.3367,0.9441,1.2864,0.8856,4.4112,3.0154,5.1363,2.3548,6.8296,4.9227,4.6014,3.4886,3.0304,0.6693,0.6444,3.1773,1.1181,3.9182,3.5587,0.6289,5.5954,4.7735,5.129,0.0658,2.0513,3.0865,2.6108,0.6345,3.071,0.5826,1.6771,0.8654,4.8064,1.8611,5.0596,3.3922,5.3293,0.9684,4.359,4.0186,0.7739,5.2296,2.8931,0.1671,1.6207,3.7275,0.3029,0.119,0.0163,0.0087,0.0008,0.0002,0.1996,0.5562,0.0002,4.0653,0.0174,2.7727,0.9167,2.7358,7.1913,0.8221,2.3309,1.1526,2.5322,7.4162,3.6803,2.387,4.5961,0.4667,5.4804,0.0001,2.0865,6.8491,0.9294,3.0197,0.0428,1.3028,3.912,1.0426,2.0851,5.1253,0.5667,2.8817,0.7816,2.5721,6.2142,4.1627,1.3699,0.7915,1.7981,3.8426,2.7252,4.8774,1.6835,1.2547,2.7858,4.5682,0.0018,0.4467,2.6114,0.0033,1.5353,0.4355,1.6128,3.8003,1.4711,4.5897,1.9842,0.211,1.223,5.7769,2.374,1.2954,4.2218,5.4925,1.9532,0.1701,3.2121,6.2625,3.3618,1.4138,4.9698,3.1184,1.036,0.3327,1.0103,6.7101,3.7486,2.1811,5.768,1.1534,3.0066,3.8298,1.5616,0.8244,4.1913,1.0215,0.539,0.8412,0.0002,4.0753,0.2601,1.1146,0.1596,0.1958,0.1975,1.4682,3.3656,0.2393,3.1725,2.5448,2.8056,3.925,5.6386,1.7837,1.4239,3.5377,1.1425,3.4937,3.2338,3.7062,1.9131,0.0034,3.3316,3.3229,0.002,0.9891,5.7623,0.6559,2.23,3.955,6.2376,5.4774,0.0003,2.5637,0.8288,2.7516,1.3096,2.9641,0.3866,1.3307,1.3335,2.1828,8.1953,1.8026,3.9737,4.4346,1.0003,0.5491,0.3098,0.5349,2.5805,5.7848,1.3927,1.1229,2.8166,3.0462,0.1507,2.1303,1.1296,1.9419,1.0137,0.2053,3.2954,0.4394,0.6433,4.743,6.3384,1.7827,4.2337,2.8686,2.2771,1.7771,2.1539,4.9387,2.4108,0.7998,1.7584,4.9886,6.9437,0.3243,1.0296,6.715,1.3535,0.7408,1.7364,1.819,3.8388,0.0615,0.8811,1.6707,0.7947,1.7851,1.0463,2.5653,0.6433,0.0002,6.1101,2.1852,0.0589,2.9278,0.0538,0.4268,2.7143,1.6194,3.1264,3.9303,0.0583,0.0059,0.0014,0.0002,0.0004,1.3873,2.6124,2.1271,0.8604,0.9992,2.7467,2.6284,2.2642,2.8692,0.0259,1.9694,1.7119,4.2833,5.9518,4.43,4.525,0.5045,1.9601,2.1678,0.193,0.3519,0.2287,6.2642,4.7512,5.7448,3.0095,0.4712,6.6249,2.628,5.6425,2.1025,5.8672,2.9613,7.6698,1.4594,1.3202,0.9124,3.1567,2.2027,4.3582,0.208,6.8024,5.9001,5.0141,6.6051,5.4508,4.0935,0.849,0.7232,2.8811,1.1818,5.5863,3.5012,0.0507,7.4366,3.3927,0.341,0.3809,0.2124]}

Ross coached the Montreal Junior Canadiens of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) for the 1970 \u2013 1971 season and the New England Whalers of the American Hockey League (AHL) for the 1971\u20131972 and 1972\u20131973 seasons, and the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League (NHL) for the 1973\u20131974 and 1974\u20131975 seasons. The Buffalo team that he coached finished in fifth and sixth place in the East. With Boston, he guided the B's to three consecutive playoff appearances, but a disappointing fourth-place finish in 1977 during the season prompted his departure from the Bruins.\n\n\"During the 1974 \u2013 1975 season with the Sabres, Ross became the league's first full time coach. That season, the Sabres went 29 \u2013 23 \u2013 18 with a fourth place finish and a trip to the playoffs. The following season, the team improved to 32 \u2013 24 \u2013 16 with second-place finishes\".\n\n\"Ross' tenure with the Sabres went well. His team won the Division title (again) with a 44-31-9 overall record, although the team finished second in their conference. To this date, he is the last coach who led his team to conference titles in back-to-back seasons. \"\n\n\"He followed that up that season with another runner-up finish (45 \u2013 34-16) and another trip to the postseason. The following season, the team made a surprising run to the Stanley Cup Finals, but was ultimately defeated by the Toronto Maple Leafs.\"\n\n\"Ross remained with the Bills as the team's play-by-play announcer, but began to become less and less involved with the day to day operations of the team. He resigned in August 1978, and stayed with the team until his firing in 1979 as the play-by-play voice of the Bills.\"\n\n\"In June, he was hired by the Los Angeles Clippers as the team's new play-by-play radio announcer and vice president. Ross remained the play-by-play announcer until his death in July of 1998.\"","token_len":490,"entropy":[8.2557,2.2017,1.7871,1.3994,0.4258,6.7431,2.3539,1.6252,1.6044,8.0906,0.0006,3.3842,4.5723,2.0957,1.9563,4.0619,7.4285,1.4219,3.0628,1.0657,5.2205,0.7522,10.1321,2.1929,4.736,2.6914,0.6137,0.9457,5.1014,7.8534,1.5667,2.3393,1.8142,1.1133,4.7951,1.0437,5.1479,7.8482,1.1071,1.3718,2.3596,3.6035,3.166,0.1388,1.0487,6.8725,1.3141,2.146,3.597,2.3814,0.3328,0.2292,2.6468,0.6822,4.0043,2.3866,1.1197,1.0869,13.5428,0.5365,2.3898,4.4344,8.8561,2.0085,9.493,0.3385,0.2984,2.9851,3.204,4.0241,1.3298,3.0683,6.1929,3.4822,4.7145,0.0461,3.1193,0.473,0.0271,0.0745,0.0566,2.7442,0.2524,0.0081,0.0,0.8782,2.0079,2.1637,4.0781,2.5668,0.6968,0.0752,2.1658,1.9598,4.1603,4.0779,5.8567,0.029,0.0016,0.2522,0.0123,2.8983,0.1273,0.002,0.2304,0.048,0.0475,0.4344,0.2246,0.0275,1.6551,2.2888,0.4064,6.6185,0.6011,0.4293,0.2329,0.0698,1.9206,2.5308,2.5163,4.4286,0.5559,0.1815,0.0071,3.2667,0.0711,0.0011,0.2534,0.4923,0.0008,0.3072,0.199,0.0303,0.6993,0.0828,0.4186,3.1564,0.0771,0.0065,0.147,0.0423,0.2415,3.534,3.0492,6.3245,4.0939,4.8618,0.2633,6.0984,2.4143,4.7598,6.3912,1.1516,1.3886,0.3103,0.128,5.4823,3.4748,5.5018,8.5017,2.8959,1.6373,5.0441,0.264,5.46,3.389,0.1501,3.1693,1.4246,3.9443,0.8155,1.0671,4.4604,4.7699,4.9305,4.4696,0.7358,0.136,0.0229,0.7662,4.7725,6.4753,0.7709,3.1451,6.4918,2.8752,0.729,1.8969,0.4048,2.599,0.8261,1.4814,0.0008,4.3727,5.9978,1.4217,4.7968,3.2114,0.6364,0.4093,5.6523,0.5942,4.2918,0.3586,2.453,4.22,1.1002,5.3055,0.104,1.9368,4.7541,3.6805,1.6009,2.1426,5.0466,1.6636,0.7334,1.7019,0.9496,3.5675,6.36,3.1633,3.7989,1.0498,4.7645,3.3003,2.0101,6.4908,0.7691,0.1183,2.5841,1.2317,5.6171,0.0396,0.1883,3.4556,0.8502,2.3387,3.8992,0.3303,0.2899,1.3119,3.1003,4.933,0.4245,6.0108,0.3979,2.7334,0.1618,2.4983,1.3917,6.2351,4.1721,0.0557,0.1826,10.415,0.3478,0.0004,2.8503,1.7741,3.8773,3.7011,1.0382,0.0935,0.4374,3.9503,1.3032,2.6255,3.0494,2.3719,1.3573,0.9389,5.3032,4.4309,3.7992,8.2683,0.9229,3.3967,0.753,6.575,1.3689,3.6868,0.9687,2.7318,5.6456,0.0585,1.2355,6.0152,1.6138,1.7485,2.7413,3.0086,0.5396,5.3626,1.887,2.0167,6.1409,2.8738,3.9173,0.0899,2.4625,2.3465,0.7175,5.9682,1.1889,3.0432,4.6535,3.629,0.1638,0.1673,6.7853,1.5992,2.261,6.8184,0.2976,0.0016,0.0009,0.0119,0.1974,1.0712,3.943,0.5641,0.0003,2.0999,3.1976,6.4119,1.7142,1.4542,6.8609,0.539,0.262,3.254,9.4227,0.0355,0.0012,0.2513,3.5648,5.4694,0.3719,4.0431,2.7596,2.8897,1.9475,1.7852,3.5419,2.8716,0.0185,0.0813,3.2776,0.6011,2.0229,3.9189,0.3478,0.2706,0.8238,2.7323,3.9861,2.5284,4.4203,1.2954,0.3276,0.1582,0.9505,0.0035,1.798,1.0503,1.7713,4.062,4.2815,1.8975,0.6987,0.2219,3.8512,0.0333,0.0019,5.3281,0.1964,0.0003,1.6531,1.6414,6.2221,1.8323,0.1119,6.1327,3.7506,2.1613,1.2155,0.1123,6.9721,0.3779,0.726,0.0004,0.0002,1.7798,2.4783,2.288,5.2387,2.0267,4.8554,2.7615,1.8234,0.0035,1.6958,1.1176,0.2591,7.4235,2.1366,0.018,0.5979,0.2594,0.1318,1.0323,0.7709,1.641,4.3382,0.9933,3.6429,2.562,1.0391,1.5762,5.3503,1.3887,0.155,1.5675,1.218,2.0742,5.5084,0.9338,3.9516,5.7813,1.4221,4.1106,0.0414,0.0094,0.0014,0.0012,3.7996,0.7753,0.1157,1.637,2.1499,0.1184,0.0002,0.8199,2.3127,5.5788,3.6882,3.2775,1.2818,2.1824,1.0091,0.6482,6.3646,0.0019,3.7884,1.41,1.0823,1.1233,0.023,3.3413,1.2644,0.0356,0.0129,0.0012,0.0009,6.7433,1.0261,3.0488,5.0739,0.9506,2.2988,2.4125,4.8249,3.5635,1.927,0.0186,0.0013,0.0022,0.0005,1.692,1.639,1.3547,3.3761,0.6331,3.7763,2.847,4.7836,1.7731]}

{"id":1864,"ended":true,"length":430,"text":"The river roughly defined the American frontier in the 19th century, particularly downstream from Kansas City, where it takes a sharp eastern turn into the heart of the state of Missouri. The lower Blue River, tributary of the lower Elkhart River into which it flows, extends upstream about 70 miles, while the upper Elkhart River flows for much of the same distance as well. It was formed by the confluence of the Blue and the White rivers at Elkhart.\n\nIn the early 19th century, the Blue River provided water power for manufacturing and agricultural development, but because the rivers of Southern Indiana were relatively shallow except for a few small tributary streams, the Blue was limited to farming and local industries. The town of Louisville was begun in 1819 as a mill town at the confluence of the White and Blue rivers on the upper Elkhart, which were here crossed by the Louisville and Louisville Canal. Louisville also provided a water port on the White River (the site is now in Franklin, Indiana). The area was very heavily settled by German immigrants during the 19th century, but by 1825 the population had grown to 1,800 and only 500 of those farmers and industry workers were able to own land. The small-wheat and cattle industries were expanding in this period. The population declined in the Great Depression in 1935. During World War 2, an estimated 400 German-Americans were interned in camps at Jeffersonville and Louisville.\n\nThe Blue River is approximately 508 miles (816km) long, runs north of the Ohio River and parallel to the northern edge of the Appalachian region and generally flows south of the Ohio River.

{"id":2314,"ended":true,"length":458,"text":"Coleridge and William Wordsworth were close friends and collaborators ; when Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy took up residence in the Lake District in late 1799 it was, in Bott's word, inevitable that Coleridge should move there, as Wordsworth's house was close to the centre of what was by far his largest and most important artistic network. It was while in the Lake District that Coleridge wrote most of his finest poems, including the epic The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and the Cantos, and it was there, in the early spring of 1800 that the young man suffered a nervous and emotional breakdown and was later hospitalised for mental illness and'sclerotic gout '. In the autumn of 1800 he moved to London, where he managed and edited a journal, The Examiner, as well as contributing several articles on the occult ; there was no public recognition at this early stage, but a few sympathetic letters to Charles Lamb, Ralph Waldo Emerson and others were the first public sign that something was wrong. The public knew that there was trouble in Coleridge's mind but there was no indication as to where he was or what form it took. A series of letters to his friend John Keats, written between January 1801 and July 1802, help to clarify his position. At this time he was still living in London but he had no money and was, it appears, in dire straits. At the end of March 1801 Coleridge's stepfather died and his brother Samuel lost his job, so the family went back to the home in Cornwall where they had to eek out a living at the beginning of the century. By June the family had been reduced to one income again and Coleridge's money was gone. As winter approached he left London and returned to live in London in the company of William Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy. These letters are written in the first person narrative tradition, but they are, as the editors tell us, of considerable interest for his contemporaries. Coleridge's letters give us a glimpse of his mental illness and his problems in London. They provide an insight into his personality in the period after his breakdown as well as his friendships and political affiliations. Coleridge's letters often describe Wordsworth and Dorothy and the times in which they lived and worked as he came to terms with his inner world. The editors have made an imaginative and valuable presentation of this important and interesting correspondence.","token_len":496,"entropy":[6.1177,4.9701,3.1903,7.2469,8.2031,0.6729,3.4129,7.0247,0.467,2.1797,3.8369,8.9488,5.5914,5.2715,0.0005,3.8056,3.3639,3.4111,5.7527,4.0114,2.074,1.5869,0.6422,2.1994,8.1202,2.2999,1.8986,7.3545,2.511,4.3105,5.9163,0.3878,5.3857,1.9348,13.5579,1.6481,5.9187,0.0274,9.5614,0.2987,8.1302,0.006,0.0002,4.9633,4.4359,2.3947,2.9201,2.5336,7.3184,0.0006,2.4379,3.7755,0.8085,3.9113,0.4971,0.9707,7.6407,0.1425,6.1541,0.7738,6.6992,3.6751,3.1485,2.8286,2.6918,0.3533,1.7307,6.5556,7.5557,0.4655,3.6417,0.5095,8.0253,2.7292,2.0363,2.103,0.1934,0.7089,1.5462,0.0009,0.0003,3.8032,6.1085,0.2486,0.5498,6.4349,3.0864,1.0511,2.7601,1.6961,5.1201,2.9015,6.0941,4.3697,0.5105,1.4381,6.0061,5.5754,0.4033,2.2376,1.4743,9.8365,3.3768,2.227,1.5091,3.9697,0.3279,2.5502,2.7037,1.4209,1.5679,2.7553,5.432,0.1322,4.0268,6.2385,2.4465,3.7949,3.5078,8.0737,1.5076,4.2962,5.9152,4.6409,0.2027,2.9688,2.1897,4.7637,5.5928,0.0061,1.8649,4.6877,1.1571,3.3101,8.3348,9.7224,1.2254,6.3855,0.2436,10.8784,3.2169,1.9516,4.0894,0.1216,2.2905,2.5211,3.6189,0.5432,2.9483,1.2581,0.6052,0.3044,7.0185,4.8421,3.3258,1.5442,5.7859,2.0782,1.4507,9.5415,1.0776,4.7829,0.4185,0.0011,5.4118,3.9553,3.7927,2.1849,1.8102,6.3562,6.296,4.4909,2.9385,2.5657,6.203,3.9356,3.854,2.5361,5.4417,0.8323,2.335,1.1318,3.6448,2.0016,6.9334,2.2675,1.7669,7.0281,7.1327,2.1493,8.9575,3.6015,0.0024,0.0008,0.7819,1.933,2.0045,5.391,1.7226,3.8186,5.3757,0.8134,4.2891,0.5357,3.1056,1.0997,2.5464,6.1094,5.1487,1.5153,3.4752,0.4123,5.0656,1.4184,3.6091,0.0026,0.0002,0.1647,2.8686,3.4563,3.2505,0.3126,0.5408,3.9698,3.8719,0.0861,3.4843,1.3855,0.7454,2.4044,0.9106,7.4182,1.2498,2.0465,0.4053,3.8536,4.6505,0.0028,1.8245,1.4736,2.5381,3.2162,2.7865,6.2974,1.6746,1.2281,4.0201,3.3474,3.7613,2.696,1.8247,0.0578,4.1209,0.4498,0.4734,0.2416,7.3576,1.2813,3.8743,1.9565,2.8892,0.8018,4.5124,2.852,0.9775,1.7929,0.6292,3.4055,2.9655,0.6881,1.6143,2.2112,2.3832,1.4934,3.2954,3.6918,1.2132,1.7053,5.3991,4.5979,2.8791,0.0377,2.6311,6.0867,1.2094,0.0027,0.5194,3.9231,1.1903,1.6046,0.013,2.814,0.9187,2.492,3.1681,0.0006,0.0009,3.3764,7.9194,1.0819,3.7222,1.23,1.1374,3.3107,5.5489,6.02,0.7289,2.2348,2.7517,3.4208,2.5212,2.4028,3.957,2.18,0.1378,2.4222,5.3152,2.1049,6.3218,1.7807,0.9934,1.6894,6.7341,9.9816,4.5003,0.5851,0.9112,0.5406,4.3956,1.0039,5.8532,0.0331,0.8606,3.4309,0.2774,4.0268,4.5558,2.8375,1.6493,1.3251,3.0995,5.3111,0.0997,4.5175,6.3286,8.6225,1.2581,2.7438,0.001,0.0005,2.2552,5.4425,0.8657,4.0874,0.5888,4.0597,7.3406,1.7285,1.7254,4.1389,3.3661,1.2894,3.0732,0.187,8.0506,1.0024,2.6193,2.953,1.3972,5.9668,0.0157,4.1236,0.137,0.0015,1.2569,2.0196,0.5816,0.3915,0.6747,5.352,4.1252,2.6451,4.6137,1.3346,1.4158,3.8759,1.1156,11.9599,8.8694,1.2285,1.4964,1.7339,1.3699,4.6561,2.0828,3.1342,5.1926,5.128,1.5326,0.0696,4.7061,4.8206,1.3445,3.3966,5.4678,4.7966,0.7287,3.7767,0.0012,0.0019,1.3879,3.3001,4.3339,1.1211,0.9243,1.5289,1.0179,1.7711,4.7556,3.4626,1.2312,2.0111,6.7117,2.6727,5.8238,1.0079,2.6294,4.5018,2.2924,2.4869,0.0554,1.1476,4.8215,4.4578,1.5666,4.1078,3.2565,0.3852,8.3902,5.3312,0.4993,0.0047,2.1237,8.121,1.4102,3.9262,4.0283,0.0003,0.573,3.4537,0.001,0.0026,1.3717,1.5955,5.9964,3.1031,12.378,0.0007,1.9474,2.9103,3.2649,2.8967,6.4596,2.6091,0.0399,0.7666,1.4124,2.0942,1.1704,2.664,3.6605,5.248,0.5566,2.1663,0.0105,0.7051,5.8451,4.5653,0.6196,2.6804,6.6078,3.3399,4.3695,3.647,7.0484,3.2251,5.6084,6.3275,0.1689,2.6592,4.4393,2.9373,3.8013,4.8995,0.7216]}

{"id":3814,"ended":false,"length":466,"text":"Stroheim's biographer Arthur Lennig compared the director's visual style to that of D. W. Griffith but felt that `` unlike Griffith, who viewed scenes as though through a fourth wall, Stroheim had the courage to put the viewer directly into the action. '' Another critic who wrote of the director's `` bold, often chaotic `` use of visual means '' described his movies as `` full of visual dynamism and visual stimulation, which give an impression of the wild freedom of youth and a playfulness that can only be expressed through movement, action, and color. ''\n\nThis is one of the few times when I've seen someone quote D. W. Griffith and then put the word \"unlike\" before it! :)\n\nWell that was very informative and very nicely done. I will have to check all those out. I do not know if i think of it as a \"look\" of Griffith but a \"look\" of \"acting\" more than anything else. And for the record, I had not heard of or seen \"The Birth of a Nation\" until about 4-5 years ago so i was unaware of the issues concerning it. As for what it had to do with Stelio and this film in particular, you are probably the only one who would know. :o)\n\nAww, thanks for the vote of confidence. I hope you enjoyed the links, I just got around to putting them together.\n\nIt's not unusual to hear about the great early directors whose pictures are of such high quality that audiences can't but think they must've been good at their jobs.\n\nYou're probably right that I'm the only one who would know the significance of \"The Birth of a Nation\" and it certainly wasn't worth getting into any argument.\n\nI was just trying to keep you from being accused of posting anything that might be considered controversial.

When the war began in 1941, the Shipyard was turned into an aircraft production plant ( Nr. 11, Air Force Plant). Sovetskaya Ukraina departed Vickers-Armstrongs shipyard in South Africa in June 1948 for Saint Petersburg on her official maiden voyage; the ship was owned by the USSR. Sovetskaya Ukraina was commissioned into the Atlantic Fleet and joined the Black Sea Fleet in June 1951. The ship was initially based at Novorossiysk and then sailed to her homeport of Sevastopol from November 1952.\n\nSovetskaya Ukraina was a training ship as well as home to the first female helicopter pilot Kseniya Petrovna ( Vova ). In 1968 she became a hospital ship. After numerous cruises to Brazil and the Caribbean, in the late 1970\u2019s and early 80\u2019s, she was assigned to the Pacific Fleet. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Sovetskaya Ukraina was stationed at Tallinn and joined the anti-submarine and anti-aircraft fleet tasked with defending the Soviet naval bases in Leningrad ( Saint Petersburg ) and Piter, both then under siege as part of Soviet military measures to deter the planned invasion of Finland. She later sailed to the Mediterranean Sea to escort various NATO ships out of Soviet waters during the Cold War.\n\nDuring the last years of her life, Sovetskaya Ukraina was stationed at Saint Petersburg. She participated in various large-scale naval and port exercises. After retiring from active duty in 1987, the ship was modernized, and she joined the fleet museum complex in Saint Petersburg. On 15 August 2002, Sovetskaya Ukraina was withdrawn from the fleet museum complex and assigned to the museum at Oktyabrskaya Yacht Harbour.\n\nSovetskaya Ukraina can be rented for events.\n\nThe ship\u2019s exterior and interior design was based on pre-war designs for Sovremennyy Korshun. The ship is now owned by the Russian Navy, though it remains in Saint Petersburg. She is often seen sailing on the Neva in the company of the warship Vasiliy Novodorov.","token_len":497,"entropy":[9.6125,4.1141,6.7194,13.5577,0.4889,2.2264,9.9079,4.9874,0.3551,2.379,2.5798,2.2989,1.4548,2.8489,2.732,1.4002,1.5025,0.5049,8.8195,9.8307,4.9932,5.6544,6.0564,8.5376,7.3583,1.9037,3.6811,8.8539,1.7243,8.9698,3.1563,4.6949,4.1859,10.9656,2.207,3.8491,4.2326,0.3403,8.3566,2.4478,8.5134,4.9427,10.8092,1.9847,1.1216,7.5764,0.7969,1.1469,3.6582,5.9049,1.0295,3.2291,2.334,1.6973,2.6178,0.6064,1.4047,8.2787,0.1661,1.2652,6.3378,1.0486,2.3855,6.0486,4.0807,1.2279,3.7603,5.8531,0.8127,0.0381,5.964,3.2044,8.0757,2.3027,4.0604,3.4565,6.0731,0.3435,0.0047,0.0024,1.437,0.0026,9.1336,5.701,9.7291,3.0205,6.3249,1.3653,7.243,4.7828,0.1018,1.0121,6.9123,2.3073,1.264,3.5261,6.0159,3.4228,7.3466,1.1395,4.0577,3.467,6.5133,6.5033,0.0553,5.6867,2.5559,1.0694,1.1523,6.7068,0.0986,1.2857,4.3883,1.5359,2.4114,0.0405,0.002,0.0019,0.8211,0.001,1.0345,3.4733,4.1133,0.6905,8.2223,1.175,4.1161,4.5192,0.4128,5.7634,0.3957,0.1052,0.6716,3.2132,2.415,0.413,2.392,1.0023,0.8357,6.1248,5.5978,0.3269,6.4176,2.9443,0.0248,1.0115,0.1177,0.0311,2.7448,2.5237,4.8744,0.7276,6.9704,2.6069,4.5942,1.4237,3.6632,0.0023,0.0049,4.66,5.7777,2.6507,1.0412,2.7953,0.0304,2.2262,0.1526,0.0023,0.0023,0.237,0.0011,0.9699,2.991,7.0732,1.2141,5.6923,1.3057,0.1292,8.2443,1.8221,1.4831,3.5758,6.7717,6.8376,0.7418,9.1136,4.178,2.6727,6.0493,0.4046,1.1958,1.6736,5.9284,6.9503,7.4321,2.5473,5.687,1.6527,2.6505,1.6481,7.8057,0.6212,2.5445,3.7774,8.0028,6.8233,0.0824,2.2136,6.4993,1.1882,2.6659,1.836,0.5222,4.222,3.3385,2.1425,1.0099,15.6656,8.6512,1.5141,1.6635,0.1656,1.6116,2.0992,0.0038,0.0544,0.7685,1.2747,1.0211,3.7708,0.1624,0.5255,6.3228,0.3157,1.1173,3.3404,0.9342,7.3636,0.2252,0.0206,1.2445,1.1984,0.0117,0.0022,0.0029,0.8425,0.0007,0.7219,3.5091,0.7177,8.0038,0.3077,2.2065,4.037,0.1786,7.2887,0.0691,2.4405,0.0076,4.0313,0.6203,0.001,1.7138,0.0849,4.7135,10.4258,0.0495,2.8338,1.0771,3.1175,3.9872,3.7158,0.847,6.5586,1.4849,0.0009,2.6216,8.0152,0.0489,0.8819,0.1094,4.3741,10.0602,5.0602,6.575,7.715,1.8869,5.4703,6.5689,2.0364,0.0009,3.2935,3.5231,6.7354,2.3473,5.7754,2.1219,8.8281,0.8724,0.3148,7.4601,0.9687,2.6101,3.7577,4.2063,0.3693,2.0393,3.2873,2.9134,2.3731,4.913,7.5937,4.4855,2.3083,5.1472,0.0735,3.5348,2.0357,3.746,0.3604,2.5696,0.0023,0.346,1.1702,0.0002,3.5208,0.4393,5.2557,2.1703,0.0441,1.948,1.7026,0.4225,0.408,0.0087,0.0018,0.0014,0.5128,0.0006,0.919,3.2852,0.6931,5.0263,0.0692,2.6419,1.4067,3.7644,0.0391,3.4661,7.4067,0.9646,0.0048,1.9208,3.3829,8.3628,2.696,2.1633,3.981,4.5747,0.5483,2.8941,1.1129,0.4895,4.6778,0.217,2.9159,0.3527,0.6955,9.5902,0.0653,2.9589,2.2457,2.1982,3.2377,0.1804,4.3414,12.2643,7.5722,2.0396,2.5097,0.0077,0.8495,4.4265,4.0583,2.5711,4.6093,0.4933,1.3017,0.0102,0.0023,0.0024,0.4227,0.0007,0.6346,7.936,0.1128,1.5182,2.297,2.2493,1.5013,1.6869,3.8291,0.1744,0.4628,4.0592,4.1613,7.8835,3.2568,0.0524,0.4405,2.2225,4.3523,6.1121,6.7135,1.3325,0.8925,0.0003,1.3493,0.0817,0.0021,0.0011,0.4103,0.0009,6.9794,0.1714,7.1263,1.4868,8.177,2.701,1.935,0.0002,3.182,1.7506,12.8091,2.0849,1.2286,6.4537,2.9441,0.774,3.6856,3.1525,3.6942,0.2156,7.4352,0.3269,1.2112,2.2721,3.3853,11.8145,8.0253,11.5938,5.8594,4.2465,6.4867,7.0822,3.5301,1.497,1.3522,2.4732,4.5865,3.7698,0.1394,0.7157,1.6537,1.805,2.2773,4.8799,1.4918,3.5426,1.5378,7.952,0.0022,0.6109,3.6742,1.31,5.0867,2.3124,3.6238,2.416,1.1677,6.207,1.5878,4.0396,1.0548,7.6501,0.0046,1.6969,8.6574,0.0133,5.7127,2.8001,0.515,5.28,9.2927,0.6347,1.8431]}
{"id":4327,"ended":true,"length":454,"text":"The business that became Gulf Oil started in 1901 with the discovery of oil at Spindletop near Beaumont, Texas. A group of investors came together to promote the development of a modern refinery in the area, and the new enterprise quickly surpassed production facilities at Beaumont and Orange, the biggest at the time, and began a slow expansion across Texas and into Louisiana, the largest producer of oil in the United States at the time. Although Gulf Oil grew quickly in the early 20th century, the company never maintained much independence from its larger oil-magnate owners. At the height of its power, and when it was one of the biggest oil companies in the world, the Gulf Oil Corporation's assets were worth somewhere around $80 billion.\n\nThe company name came from a Gulf of Mexico island to the east of Beaumont, one of the oil boom communities named after the discovery. Spindletop grew from a village in the first decade of the 20th century into the largest city and most important commercial center in the area. The area would remain heavily settled until the beginning of the Great Depression and the World War II, and it would become part of a booming post-war industrial and residential area.\n\nIn addition to petroleum products, Gulf Oil expanded into the refining and production of sugar and sugar-based products, coal-based fuels, and more. The main oil refinery in Corpus Christi would be converted to produce diesel fuel at a cost of $60 million. In 1957, Gulf Oil Corporation was still the largest consumer of petroleum products in the United States, although most of this use was to refine crude at its refining and processing facilities.\n\nAccording to the company's website, Gulf Oil is in the process of restructuring the corporation, and the company was in a $12 billion bankruptcy at the end of 2002. The company made many purchases during the first half of the 20th century as well as the 1970s, and the largest concentration of purchases came during the postwar period. The company also entered into several joint ventures in the mid-1990s that allowed for the operation of refineries owned by other companies.\n\nWhen the corporation was sold in the mid-1980s as part of a plan to divest it of many of its petroleum resources through the 1980s, the company would become the Gulf Cartel, and the Gulf of Mexico was declared an international crime scene as a result of the cartel's activities at the time.","token_len":498,"entropy":[7.7525,4.6366,6.0801,9.6965,2.1785,4.6203,1.5442,7.519,2.5108,1.3932,3.7719,0.1437,1.917,3.7684,8.4995,4.3263,1.002,1.5647,6.0437,7.3495,0.8418,0.0154,0.4859,2.4108,0.3846,4.0198,4.5494,0.1027,3.631,4.1907,1.4598,0.7052,7.6747,1.038,3.0505,0.2535,2.3917,5.895,2.6507,1.7642,1.4862,1.4133,1.7357,1.6562,1.8195,4.7852,6.565,4.0236,6.4936,6.389,5.9504,2.5769,3.8411,0.0001,0.0007,1.3672,8.2843,3.1919,5.0159,6.2577,7.8031,0.506,0.0282,2.8766,1.275,3.7439,3.9715,5.4897,2.712,4.9548,1.8178,2.5018,3.2155,2.7125,2.2003,3.1878,3.5778,2.7433,0.4162,1.3186,0.5249,0.1139,1.8411,0.0094,2.8551,0.2842,0.0212,0.1327,5.1987,1.9194,0.195,5.5305,2.3112,2.673,1.0637,1.8134,2.8274,0.0081,0.0867,0.2075,1.7327,2.0728,2.9581,6.7598,4.3052,7.5263,1.9582,1.2514,4.3875,4.3485,3.4509,7.8841,4.3597,7.1536,5.4651,0.982,4.6038,0.6724,3.8461,0.0051,1.2929,4.4821,0.8926,5.1042,5.1482,2.022,1.2832,6.8198,0.0543,0.1905,3.0626,2.2968,1.0744,0.1483,0.2835,1.0103,0.2078,1.926,2.1393,0.5614,3.026,5.19,4.6841,0.9897,2.9604,6.1945,1.9232,0.0611,4.7438,0.2128,0.8443,1.6148,0.0071,2.0308,2.5454,9.2087,3.3916,0.5817,2.2179,5.6878,3.5231,0.1022,5.6424,6.3856,0.392,2.0634,0.9665,4.1954,0.0002,0.0014,0.7249,5.2047,0.0961,0.3852,4.9294,6.4721,7.0289,8.2432,0.5675,0.9234,7.3023,2.4447,7.0272,0.0347,0.0082,0.0122,6.0091,2.4107,1.0367,5.8188,1.6836,0.9987,6.5502,5.8519,0.0647,0.1235,0.569,0.0008,0.0455,3.0901,2.1773,0.5862,4.7469,4.2994,3.6893,1.8539,3.9781,1.7424,0.2598,0.4558,3.1661,0.5411,1.7564,3.5593,5.5369,3.5439,5.2881,6.1467,2.2586,0.4237,5.2591,0.0025,0.0534,4.1189,0.4377,2.4082,1.299,6.4855,0.0309,0.1126,1.1239,1.8966,2.652,2.8453,2.0121,4.294,0.0024,3.0668,4.7986,6.5881,0.1193,0.3177,2.02,3.4098,4.0098,1.3863,1.2102,1.7583,0.0002,2.1953,4.5384,0.0788,6.1936,3.1528,0.316,1.2484,0.1064,5.6065,1.2148,2.5948,5.04,1.3679,2.8356,0.2711,6.2153,1.9369,3.9803,1.5712,1.6643,2.2634,1.3833,7.6098,3.2526,1.1492,1.5858,0.5087,0.9662,5.3831,0.6045,1.8525,6.2285,4.3378,1.6615,0.9462,6.4276,0.0067,0.0003,4.3063,1.3985,5.4169,1.1161,3.6891,4.1791,1.0814,3.198,1.4581,0.9346,0.148,0.8318,4.037,0.6235,1.2395,2.6662,4.968,0.2849,1.4759,0.0503,4.2864,2.5175,6.7168,2.6781,0.6639,6.2817,0.3846,1.9668,0.4136,0.3252,0.2041,0.5228,0.0079,0.7671,5.5343,5.1783,0.5879,3.1326,4.5507,0.9804,4.655,5.6063,3.7047,5.5537,2.2339,3.7142,3.5723,3.6628,0.8962,0.6366,1.2672,0.0002,5.2735,0.0058,1.4944,3.5715,0.2938,1.6772,0.1206,1.6846,0.042,2.3589,5.3014,1.0561,0.9483,0.0019,5.3835,2.9508,4.694,1.8931,1.3436,2.0763,1.3645,3.9485,4.0743,2.3796,4.7838,4.5705,0.7182,3.603,4.2168,0.1515,0.6091,0.001,5.1261,0.222,1.5422,0.7493,5.7136,4.7337,6.4975,2.865,0.7848,3.9787,1.108,0.0107,1.6057,1.6507,0.0084,0.0525,4.541,1.6624,0.7098,2.6279,3.5745,0.0847,0.9953,1.8147,2.0422,5.2135,7.1109,0.2172,3.6066,3.1076,2.4767,0.0544,7.1537,1.1172,0.8368,1.9272,0.7712,2.7858,5.5688,0.3424,3.1497,4.026,0.2092,3.0989,0.3191,3.1323,0.1601,1.6946,0.0145,2.5814,4.0834,3.0279,1.6197,6.3178,0.0558,6.3184,0.0137,5.9658,0.0887,3.3337,1.1868,0.9726,0.7363,0.0002,5.0606,1.089,4.8838,1.1318,2.8424,0.831,4.557,1.8508,0.069,2.4057,0.0066,5.165,2.4627,0.0011,0.887,5.6618,0.1951,4.568,4.3633,0.1481,4.7933,0.7691,0.0936,4.5098,5.9672,5.8807,1.6966,4.6666,0.0326,0.1038,1.1407,1.3361,5.2546,3.1386,1.1598,6.6428,8.0618,0.3026,1.6657,3.1332,2.034,3.564,3.7318,0.099,2.1558,4.9429,2.7095,2.8612,6.5951,2.1495,4.0574,0.8986,0.135,1.0396,0.9417,6.0162,0.5902,2.1446,5.1182,0.5763,0.1641,0.1068]}
{"id":488,"ended":true,"length":467,"text":"By the early 1970s, Bedell had decided to run for political office. In 1972, he ran against Wiley Mayne, a Republican incumbent in Iowa's 6th congressional district. Mayne was considered one of the Republican Party's \"loyalists\", a conservative who opposed the \"liberal\" policies of the Johnson administration while maintaining a friendly relationship with Richard Nixon. As the Watergate scandal unfolded through the summer and fall of 1973, Mayne did little to distance himself from Nixon and his Administration. In fact, he began to emerge as a possible ally of Richard Nixon in 1974. Bedell, however, believed that Nixon's downfall was imminent and that he should run as a conservative alternative to Mayne. He set out to accomplish this by running on a platform that emphasized his own pro-life view as well as his opposition to tax cuts for the rich.\n\nMeanwhile, Mayne was seeking re-election unopposed in the Republican primary. Mayne was a conservative stalwart in the Iowa's 6th Congressional district, but he was also considered a close friend of Richard Nixon. The Watergate scandal had begun to unravel shortly before the 1972 election, and by late October 1973, Richard Nixon was facing increasing and widespread calls for his resignation. It was the second scandal in a year to engulf the Nixon Administration, and this one threatened to do further damage as well. Richard Nixon knew it, and he was determined to keep it from harming his chances at survival. He told one of his advisors on November 23, 1973, \"Let's make this last one just like the first...let's just close this thing down and forget all about it.\"\n\nThis attempt to end a scandal was the beginning of the end for Richard Nixon. While Bedell continued to believe that Richard Nixon was in a serious moral situation, he wanted no part of helping him remain President of the United States.\n\nAfter taking early leads in all five polls, Bedell lost the Republican nomination to Wiley Mayne in the February 5, 1974, Iowa Republican primary. At this point, Bedell withdrew from political life and went quietly back to his wife's home.\n\nWhen Richard Nixon learned of Bedell's withdrawal, he was enraged.\n\nA little less than two weeks later, Richard Nixon resigned the office of President of the United States. It was the first time an American president ever resigned an elected office rather than serve a full term. The resignation took place on August 9, 1974.","token_len":500,"entropy":[2.6862,5.7728,2.5207,0.1002,0.2216,10.9279,3.7408,2.9051,5.6196,0.4564,4.3233,0.4815,5.5217,0.0213,1.6539,2.8107,3.0819,0.1468,0.7389,2.5141,2.2132,11.8418,8.203,4.617,0.612,0.9022,2.6551,3.8925,2.0626,5.3812,2.7463,2.2441,0.0015,2.4029,0.0177,0.6288,3.0392,0.0003,1.7684,5.4912,3.3144,0.0106,0.1376,5.36,1.4545,0.0341,3.7259,5.5675,1.8085,1.7227,4.4952,2.6147,4.6051,0.9304,2.5343,1.5475,5.9495,4.7056,1.0799,2.6449,0.3081,0.9674,5.0941,0.3164,5.5785,4.6702,1.4529,5.7602,0.3805,0.0044,6.1165,0.0266,0.2784,4.068,2.0817,5.7475,0.473,1.6154,7.8617,0.5746,4.7125,4.2928,0.3357,0.0528,1.3323,0.0501,2.032,0.0003,5.8794,3.8864,0.2277,5.1316,0.1538,0.028,4.4265,2.0054,1.4199,5.5019,0.4553,2.0291,1.8878,0.0216,0.9302,5.0205,0.7276,7.4214,0.1193,0.8771,6.1747,5.1061,0.9008,4.0194,0.0178,2.0824,3.5061,0.8193,3.9073,0.0153,2.862,2.9034,0.0027,5.4954,0.4998,1.3764,1.0971,7.1334,0.9428,4.1855,0.8355,1.3441,1.5456,1.8304,3.6748,2.3144,0.4774,4.0062,3.3103,0.5539,0.8446,0.0003,0.3598,2.7747,6.3266,1.7231,0.2037,6.2607,0.3896,1.7205,2.1423,3.4446,0.8781,0.8712,1.7291,3.2851,3.8864,4.6204,4.6013,0.0788,1.3726,5.886,3.6258,0.3709,0.0095,0.9081,1.9057,0.0051,7.6279,1.3321,0.5489,0.2644,1.1933,0.5004,1.635,0.0042,7.2466,0.067,3.0163,0.0033,1.3973,4.9969,2.562,0.0282,0.0014,9.871,0.2151,0.0002,1.0711,1.6485,3.6729,0.5492,1.3902,4.4987,0.0027,1.826,2.3704,3.9821,5.9236,0.0001,3.562,0.7485,2.8841,7.36,1.1162,0.0018,1.7364,1.1408,0.8005,1.8521,1.1061,1.1945,1.7682,4.5616,1.0199,5.1902,1.0734,0.4029,2.6381,0.0143,0.8464,2.8739,6.3351,0.5887,2.0326,4.4922,0.8256,2.5543,4.5518,1.6178,1.0439,2.4332,1.3579,0.7974,0.5194,4.6794,3.1552,2.9951,2.7645,0.1967,5.9444,0.0174,1.4881,3.9896,6.7587,6.4896,2.9929,4.8663,0.8631,2.2365,0.3195,0.4478,4.6841,0.3681,3.6034,3.6945,4.657,1.4467,2.2193,4.1529,3.0252,2.9772,0.5914,2.9836,0.7214,1.2539,0.8183,4.7157,3.2636,5.6339,0.1717,5.2721,4.699,0.0585,6.8736,2.4533,0.1069,5.1668,0.0365,5.7778,4.6816,1.909,0.5028,1.6784,2.3903,1.3615,0.0908,3.1349,2.9925,1.2859,5.1049,0.5517,3.1207,2.9889,7.8159,0.256,2.3923,4.51,5.0513,0.8203,0.417,3.7477,4.0341,2.7992,3.7665,0.1299,0.6247,0.2529,0.9921,4.6083,1.0361,3.4349,2.2314,6.6804,2.6704,5.6155,3.3785,1.101,2.6886,6.3679,4.9108,0.239,2.8961,6.2921,2.1442,3.1756,2.1288,1.2712,3.6658,3.0513,1.0281,0.5965,0.8054,1.0448,0.0002,4.2947,5.3644,0.6172,4.5165,4.2223,0.8071,2.0066,4.0818,3.3413,0.02,1.376,0.6514,0.3589,1.9335,0.0108,0.6709,4.302,4.8092,0.0176,3.9536,0.2583,4.8793,0.4234,3.7172,0.0463,0.8665,2.9517,2.0466,3.8131,5.7161,4.3886,0.2933,0.7922,5.7966,5.1305,0.1105,0.201,8.7416,1.5499,7.1132,4.8581,2.5023,0.0041,0.01,0.0009,0.2885,3.6681,0.0002,3.9349,4.6122,9.2506,8.8079,0.33,6.0662,3.2671,6.0659,0.9489,1.6565,0.0242,3.3142,1.6178,3.5983,2.4246,1.0185,5.5301,0.0411,0.0013,1.5486,0.8063,6.1659,4.1569,0.328,0.408,1.8071,1.8239,1.8449,0.3146,0.1841,4.9372,1.3891,0.4572,0.1918,2.3757,0.0127,6.5981,0.7336,5.4021,1.4095,1.4058,3.7047,7.2496,4.3171,0.4821,1.2108,4.0772,1.4259,2.0027,2.4502,1.8679,0.0002,4.4018,3.9166,0.0261,5.9729,0.978,0.7919,0.0056,0.0139,2.8573,0.8015,0.4216,2.4786,3.8318,0.7197,4.6339,0.0002,4.678,5.5619,3.9746,0.0039,1.586,0.51,0.6018,0.0507,2.5693,0.0121,3.6761,3.6791,4.5127,0.4107,1.444,0.7274,0.0141,0.0261,0.0015,0.8963,4.0553,0.2671,2.3884,1.5266,0.6066,4.4098,0.8572,0.7878,3.8915,2.0521,4.9361,3.7643,0.4045,7.7037,0.0089,4.3404,3.1986,2.8871,0.0891,0.7765,2.3548,1.4987,5.5429,0.4474,1.5366,3.091,3.4565,0.1326,0.4049,1.1665]}

The other part of the volume deals with recent re-interpretations of the book by the likes of B L Gupta and Swami Hari Prakash and is an in depth analysis of both the original work and the latter adaptations. The text of the Sushruta Samhita with the modern additions is also provided as an appendix.","token_len":500,"entropy":[9.4676,4.4451,4.8532,1.9613,3.0038,6.4573,9.6516,2.1035,5.1744,0.243,1.0583,5.2534,0.4456,0.1595,0.2855,7.7979,1.4973,0.0611,0.4904,3.9396,5.3768,2.9348,0.8866,10.3247,0.8403,7.1146,0.7858,6.9206,0.009,0.0024,2.5299,5.4561,0.0034,2.8565,3.4219,2.9239,10.3684,2.3895,0.7219,4.5903,0.0225,0.26,1.4791,0.3334,6.2179,8.3966,0.5733,2.8137,6.4673,6.1662,0.01,1.7752,3.5476,7.6338,5.3174,3.8071,0.5657,0.4586,1.346,0.0938,2.8427,3.2127,2.8999,2.9632,4.1547,2.476,1.236,2.2451,0.0306,0.0161,0.0132,0.3773,0.0228,0.0181,0.528,0.3267,0.4094,6.941,7.0597,0.6413,1.0209,1.2397,3.9055,0.1379,4.6532,4.7987,1.5408,4.3153,9.7835,0.1942,3.6192,3.8313,0.2142,2.9038,5.8059,0.4233,3.0245,5.9387,1.4219,3.7442,0.1373,4.6066,0.1666,8.3042,1.293,1.1414,2.0906,5.25,5.8221,0.2865,0.4648,1.3394,0.0048,0.0044,0.0088,0.1,0.0077,0.0046,0.3048,1.0167,2.2867,3.5217,0.2243,0.3808,0.4657,1.0272,1.5953,1.6358,5.7065,1.3469,3.7804,2.9188,2.1631,3.68,3.2516,2.9052,0.2447,1.4119,0.0019,1.9427,5.456,2.7332,4.7933,4.04,3.4919,1.7086,2.6685,1.2844,5.1838,2.0349,6.1767,0.0521,0.0128,0.0106,0.0098,2.3962,0.0392,0.4502,4.1765,2.3452,1.6344,0.434,5.7599,4.5929,4.9393,4.3052,0.113,2.1989,0.0177,0.0151,0.0122,5.4186,7.1891,3.1556,6.4867,0.3027,5.1515,0.0027,1.3565,2.2168,3.0486,0.138,2.6323,0.2634,0.5773,3.3611,0.1083,6.652,7.5472,1.0673,1.4369,0.5154,0.5874,0.5436,1.787,2.0715,2.271,6.3862,0.001,5.2947,8.7352,6.5076,1.2593,7.688,0.4052,5.8056,1.2102,5.9559,1.0391,0.0182,3.6578,3.5699,3.4486,3.6762,2.8486,2.3985,0.1476,5.2322,0.8498,2.3426,4.2283,0.4803,0.7482,7.4772,9.9367,0.7586,1.6928,3.9838,1.5892,0.8009,2.2582,0.0077,0.0018,0.0029,0.0411,0.0048,0.0045,6.5997,2.2304,5.8638,4.7238,1.7795,3.0365,3.9545,3.5994,1.3007,0.8915,0.8487,0.7942,0.0002,4.173,0.1195,0.0061,0.007,3.5462,1.3591,1.6702,0.2251,0.0981,0.024,0.0042,0.019,0.0757,0.0031,0.0013,0.0012,0.014,0.0024,0.004,0.1353,0.9767,0.0325,0.004,0.0009,0.0017,0.0691,0.2597,0.004,0.0065,0.0004,0.0034,0.0055,0.0095,0.0001,0.0021,0.003,0.0006,0.0222,0.007,0.0017,0.0037,0.0047,0.0028,0.0114,0.0041,0.0262,0.0442,0.0007,0.0089,0.0168,0.0022,0.0,0.0021,0.0028,0.0635,0.0017,0.0013,0.0036,0.0086,0.0017,0.0006,0.0023,0.0049,0.0009,0.004,0.001,0.0025,0.002,0.1181,0.0053,0.0006,0.0012,0.0038,0.0023,0.0024,0.0045,0.0045,0.0015,0.0007,0.0023,0.0049,0.0028,0.0011,0.0007,0.0008,0.0242,0.0015,0.0015,0.0019,0.0014,0.0006,0.0002,0.003,0.0013,0.0319,0.0123,0.0003,0.0027,0.1859,0.0004,0.0025,0.0007,0.0018,0.0008,0.0008,0.0002,0.0034,0.0033,0.004,0.0024,0.0006,0.0008,0.0036,0.0095,0.0009,0.0013,0.0031,0.0034,0.002,0.0011,0.0005,0.0015,0.001,0.0158,0.0007,0.0007,0.0012,0.0025,0.0001,0.0044,0.0026,0.0005,0.0003,0.0011,0.0069,0.002,0.0348,0.0008,0.7486,0.0001,0.9984,0.0898,0.0276,0.0277,0.0018,0.0076,0.0173,0.0309,0.0169,0.1231,0.0034,0.0006,0.0032,0.0013,0.0005,0.0008,0.0011,0.0006,0.0018,0.0054,0.0073,0.0009,0.0038,0.0108,0.0011,0.0083,0.0004,0.0014,0.0015,0.0077,0.001,0.0008,0.004,0.0004,0.0016,0.0021,0.0007,0.0019,0.0005,0.0011,0.0081,0.005,0.001,0.0008,0.0005,0.0041,0.0036,0.0011,0.0007,0.0006,0.0002,0.0003,0.0045,0.0019,0.0013,0.0021,0.0014,0.0012,0.014,0.0007,0.0043,0.0015,0.0002,0.0025,0.0023,0.0088,0.015,0.0007,0.0039,0.0031,0.0008,0.0005,0.0662,0.0012,0.0015,0.0009,0.001,0.0007,0.0028,0.0031,0.0006,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.0032,0.0074,0.0006,0.0382,0.001,0.0005,0.0014,0.0054,0.0143,0.0013,0.0009,0.0335,0.0029,0.0013,0.0006,0.001,0.0165,0.0049,0.003,0.002,0.0008,0.0012,0.0017,0.0026,0.0003]}
{"id":4645,"ended":true,"length":439,"text":"A tropical depression formed on November 3 in the western Caribbean Sea about 150 miles ( 240 km ) south of the Cayman Islands. The depression moved north, reaching tropical storm strength as it approached Puerto Rico. As it turned south late on November 4, the depression weakened to a depression and eventually dissipated later on November 5.\n\nThere Were No Tropical Storm Warnings or Watches in Effect at any Time\n\nThere were no tropical storm warnings or watches in effect at any time during the life cycle of this system.\n\nMaximum sustained winds were near 35 kt ( 40 mph ) on November 3. Some slow strengthening was possible during the next couple of days.\n\nMaximum estimated ocean levels (above normal tides) were near or below the average for this time of year.\n\nFrequent rainfall accumulations of 0.1 in ( 0.2 cm ) to 3.0 in ( 75 mm ) were possible in the BVI, U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and in the U.S. eastern seaboard. Heavy rainfall of 3.0 in ( 75 mm ) or greater with isolated maximums of 9.0 in ( 230 mm ) were possible in Cuba. Coastal flooding was possible in areas particularly vulnerable to flooding. Severe storm surge could also occur in coastal areas, particularly along the U.S. east coast.\n\nThe main issues were heavy rain and high seas, although the threat to life and property was generally low.\n\nDISCUSSION: A broad low pressure area associated with an upper-level trough remained very elongated far to the southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands on November 3. On the next day the trough moved northwest into the southern Gulf of Tehuantepec and the central Caribbean. As the tropical cyclone moved into the eastern Caribbean Sea southwest of Jamaica, it became centered near the southeastern coast of the island. While the center passed west of Jamaica, the center stayed within the mountainous terrain of the island and the depression never fully embedded beneath it. Therefore, the center moved along the eastern and western slopes of mountains, gradually weakening.\n\nOn November 5, the depression remained disorganized and weak as it meandered near the center of the island. By evening the depression was centered near the western outskirts of the island and it soon weakened to a tropical depression. The depression was absorbed into a frontal low located to the east early on November 6, and a tropical depression by evening.","token_len":501,"entropy":[11.6242,4.1799,7.0393,2.7012,3.9241,3.4734,4.277,1.085,4.078,3.8579,2.3866,5.2875,4.7758,0.7688,1.4364,12.3409,0.5282,3.1585,1.8497,0.2617,1.0291,5.5893,0.0584,0.0342,0.5084,1.5069,2.5128,5.902,2.3728,3.666,4.6224,6.0796,4.4835,4.2284,4.3604,1.7943,2.1787,4.6104,0.0799,1.622,4.6549,1.7327,4.2856,1.5295,8.7732,1.4331,0.9694,0.9769,0.149,1.0471,2.4724,5.1391,1.9673,1.0118,4.2583,3.3172,4.294,5.0043,0.0016,7.8992,2.2922,1.4817,0.5649,0.4728,1.0234,0.0041,5.0913,10.3724,2.288,2.3406,0.2727,3.346,0.0005,5.3485,11.6183,0.3723,2.285,9.5116,3.347,5.7691,0.8615,1.3067,0.0002,3.5193,0.553,0.1198,1.2924,0.4952,0.2474,0.4602,0.4862,0.321,0.0146,0.892,0.1082,0.0119,2.0653,0.3934,8.066,4.5429,0.1075,2.7716,6.1315,0.7278,1.3562,0.0002,6.6357,3.536,0.1842,1.6042,5.8942,4.6922,4.54,2.7132,2.1147,6.9368,0.12,1.7641,2.781,0.9824,1.752,2.1463,5.8453,9.9094,7.4031,2.8701,2.918,2.8954,0.4734,2.6961,3.4714,0.1323,0.257,1.1864,0.855,0.0002,2.9324,8.0157,6.2559,4.4296,4.0759,5.2667,4.3565,8.3588,0.1939,0.6437,3.7002,5.379,1.1352,2.7939,3.6289,1.6381,2.7468,1.647,0.6443,0.0573,0.4131,0.6183,0.0003,5.0194,3.1287,3.7374,7.4088,0.0329,3.2589,5.1929,0.1121,2.1994,7.2442,0.3526,4.8593,0.0133,2.4569,1.3559,0.212,5.7412,3.4662,0.6395,1.5913,2.4906,0.0404,9.0585,2.7211,0.0468,1.7229,2.509,1.7922,0.8459,7.0151,6.9424,2.5139,5.4838,0.1339,0.0073,0.7689,0.8101,0.0013,0.4526,2.5099,0.0017,0.4665,1.0521,6.3272,0.6437,2.6858,0.0023,0.0682,0.083,8.5124,2.58,0.0023,0.0006,0.4058,6.5458,1.099,3.8344,3.5112,0.806,1.5376,2.8306,0.067,2.2163,0.0665,0.0166,2.4579,1.6898,5.7081,6.3959,5.3759,3.6528,1.3701,4.4838,0.6665,0.6604,0.5788,0.0391,7.293,0.0569,0.0311,1.2706,0.3461,0.7446,6.9542,1.5128,7.3234,1.5705,1.2841,0.9252,0.9084,4.9544,7.4687,2.5591,0.1368,2.1971,0.8824,5.6851,0.1751,2.8147,1.907,4.0107,2.5723,0.5921,1.2739,3.7303,0.2776,2.4626,1.9795,3.738,0.4845,3.1972,0.0032,0.005,0.4707,2.6716,0.1605,0.3725,0.4379,0.0002,2.2736,5.3746,7.4976,2.5669,5.6826,2.372,1.6901,3.0892,4.0004,1.8619,3.9608,1.9677,6.5827,2.3016,2.5727,1.8654,0.4816,0.9955,5.9408,2.3199,0.2548,1.1199,0.0002,8.6229,0.8424,0.0181,0.0034,2.6016,4.4836,7.8519,7.0137,2.7663,6.5024,6.6229,0.012,3.7767,4.3434,2.1884,1.2226,4.056,6.8591,5.5572,11.2578,0.0668,10.1322,3.1828,0.086,2.5,1.2063,0.5762,9.9599,0.4071,1.6976,0.0052,2.1851,3.0334,0.5685,0.6673,0.8017,4.9631,1.35,4.995,0.3785,2.6736,1.2078,2.4637,3.39,3.6863,0.6132,4.0403,3.3353,0.1807,11.6922,0.1155,0.4315,0.0125,1.6624,3.3981,4.9374,3.0194,1.3555,4.3483,0.8873,5.3308,3.1407,0.0674,2.7328,3.0384,0.4035,3.3967,1.3337,2.1667,7.1479,1.6233,6.1002,0.636,1.8867,3.6562,5.3293,2.1692,0.5629,4.6674,2.5931,0.1643,1.2808,3.421,1.1982,5.1544,1.1645,5.0485,6.8485,5.1203,2.4018,2.456,0.8488,0.8283,2.0587,5.2703,3.8438,0.5246,8.646,3.6405,1.1134,0.519,1.9656,2.1371,2.3406,5.1696,6.7201,4.531,10.3529,5.9727,1.0723,0.1554,6.5036,0.2543,1.0219,2.5363,3.2629,4.2227,0.4092,3.0302,3.2345,1.4573,5.4953,0.0866,7.2692,1.9159,5.4687,3.1695,2.334,1.5657,0.0003,3.3801,0.7012,1.9597,0.4878,0.8178,3.1036,5.3119,9.0054,0.7363,1.2122,5.1309,3.7151,0.4397,12.2143,0.4982,0.0022,5.2439,0.5502,4.1316,0.279,0.4884,1.5703,0.7603,4.8055,4.592,1.9581,1.0435,1.8001,3.7561,1.964,0.3878,3.8504,6.7369,0.0155,0.656,0.6202,1.4326,3.5935,5.5317,3.9491,0.6123,0.221,4.3859,0.4597,0.5354,1.7171,2.0072,2.1573,8.5542,2.0494,2.3521,7.4396,5.2528,13.767,4.6985,0.1162,2.1079,11.6268,1.1731,0.625,0.569,1.7527,1.7108,4.3009,4.422,0.2017,6.3293,1.3792,1.2184]}
{"id":2170,"ended":true,"length":444,"text":"From 1837, Alkan lived in the Square d 'Orl\u00e9ans in Paris, which was inhabited by numerous celebrities of the time including Marie Taglioni, Alexandre Dumas, George Sand, and Chopin.\n\nThe Square d 'Orl\u00e9ans was very artistic, so it was home to many talented musicians such as the flutist Charles Le Moyne. It was also the home of Charles Bovary, who lived there with his wife.\n\nOne day Pierre Alkan saw a child playing the violin, and began to wonder, how she could play this violin.\n\nAt this time, Alkan and Bovary were drinking and one day they started to quarrel. This disagreement lasted for several hours. One day Alkan said to Bovary that he preferred not to live in the Square anymore, as he was very bored there.\n\nBovary said to him that he could live with him a few days, so that they could discuss the issue further. And on the 2 January 1862, Pierre Alkan began to spend a month with Charles Bovary.\n\nWhen I first read this book, I wanted to go straight to my own blog or my own website, but I don't know what to write.\n\nCharles Bovary\n\nSo here it is. I just want to say a few words. I have really enjoyed reading this book. It has a very nice style, it contains humor, lots of humor. It shows many details about the time when this novel takes place.\n\nThe book also gives many details about many of the characters in this book. It is very important to know the characters, if we want to appreciate the novel.\n\nIt also describes very well the Parisian society of the time. There, many famous people where living. It shows how they lived and how they were thinking of.\n\nThis novel has a lot of things to tell us and I think that all of us like to read different books with different subjects and of course with different character.\n\nThis book will help us understand the different aspects of human life. It will make us look deeper, and even if at first glance we do not understand everything, we will get the main themes at the end.\n\nI would like to say that if you like to read books about human life, and you are tired of reading just happy stories without any problems, I would recommend this book to you.","token_len":502,"entropy":[7.4161,4.3215,0.5161,7.5695,7.6249,7.8238,0.5471,1.7648,9.9421,8.988,10.1545,5.4282,5.4009,0.0028,3.9104,3.0886,1.2791,3.7615,1.471,5.0034,0.146,4.9428,9.1444,3.3664,1.0187,1.7046,3.0274,5.1651,12.4988,1.8541,2.1642,0.7006,0.4304,7.6153,0.0254,1.7404,0.3097,0.4322,5.5269,8.2573,3.2164,1.9097,10.214,0.4345,0.4037,1.9768,0.0176,2.6031,1.919,0.3859,0.3984,0.0474,0.0017,0.0058,1.0825,5.2354,7.9651,1.3183,4.8926,1.8169,0.6076,5.2917,0.0552,1.3793,4.5059,2.2434,3.6185,0.0015,3.7514,7.8248,3.6986,1.0044,4.4208,4.34,7.8909,0.8509,3.2087,2.7497,0.5722,0.7598,2.5375,1.2651,0.1318,4.7818,4.3955,6.0048,0.2511,0.5155,1.5938,3.9188,1.9562,2.6911,0.2498,0.7938,3.0821,1.1146,0.0002,4.8474,3.1512,5.3522,3.3851,0.0742,4.2192,1.2732,5.9089,2.6049,4.6619,2.5252,2.5626,0.9491,3.8234,0.5196,3.5331,3.7816,3.9681,6.2722,0.5789,1.3651,2.6624,2.8837,1.3885,1.7891,0.0002,4.5316,2.3459,1.5064,0.8381,1.6949,0.0067,3.3247,4.152,0.0458,0.0013,1.241,7.9054,2.409,5.5596,0.9458,3.1911,3.4865,0.8822,4.3176,0.7294,4.7474,6.66,3.9595,0.9327,2.2132,1.4617,1.0863,4.8549,1.099,2.4554,0.0016,4.0339,1.0117,0.7472,0.0036,0.0026,4.3724,0.707,8.1691,3.3943,0.0335,5.9423,1.2732,0.8447,0.285,5.2225,1.0816,2.8882,0.7552,1.5755,4.2921,4.6961,5.3535,0.3671,0.9067,0.0002,1.5195,0.0157,0.0017,2.5285,1.6672,1.4177,1.6211,0.7221,2.355,2.4895,3.3325,3.1389,6.2698,2.4693,0.9499,1.1593,3.6598,2.9654,3.5689,0.234,5.0295,1.6968,4.5559,3.445,0.2348,5.6395,4.7779,1.2555,5.6207,8.4199,6.2975,0.3691,1.6085,0.2963,0.0007,4.0877,0.4903,5.8617,2.0226,3.4581,2.9152,4.5794,0.7302,0.0075,0.0021,0.9388,0.4129,0.0002,3.4395,5.5997,2.2879,2.9834,1.8141,2.5536,0.3942,0.3582,4.5747,0.0858,3.3402,7.0643,0.2506,4.1138,3.7369,6.7633,4.6871,3.2406,1.423,2.8282,1.558,1.116,0.889,4.4325,0.0008,2.0321,2.3103,1.3901,3.8241,1.4843,1.6776,0.0003,6.9531,0.3732,0.0124,0.0029,3.4407,0.0002,4.4581,3.5545,2.7755,0.0565,1.3976,2.0068,4.6373,1.705,0.085,1.5553,3.0983,1.2215,0.5548,2.6318,1.9332,2.6037,5.831,0.7685,1.7147,0.6875,0.3042,1.0275,1.8039,1.9208,3.1376,2.0517,4.0078,3.5278,1.3764,2.9665,4.4078,7.2405,0.6661,5.6965,0.0137,3.6383,2.2245,1.4872,5.0932,4.5285,5.3825,1.625,1.3595,5.2534,3.4999,4.4372,5.016,5.6041,0.0065,1.0628,1.3723,0.0002,2.6684,2.8,3.4429,3.3721,4.2935,1.7808,0.2178,5.1801,1.429,0.2378,2.567,1.9436,1.1747,2.1339,0.5281,2.6574,1.9234,1.6457,3.5614,0.7096,1.5797,2.306,2.8244,2.1216,5.4434,4.2633,2.0538,0.169,7.2444,1.1832,4.6416,1.7501,0.9079,0.0002,3.2511,1.6782,5.2946,5.0186,1.9359,0.8381,7.6198,0.94,3.1654,2.2669,1.0813,0.4094,0.6223,3.3453,6.3156,3.0823,3.6402,1.3768,8.5874,4.2033,2.6547,2.7904,2.0951,1.986,2.8557,1.8711,2.089,1.7693,0.5796,2.4523,7.4622,3.7635,6.8216,1.1219,0.0002,3.5379,2.7483,2.8868,1.3595,1.2967,0.1717,4.4434,1.4354,1.882,1.1362,3.9733,2.3276,2.109,1.7622,4.4711,0.8518,1.0621,6.1987,1.368,1.221,7.2284,2.7253,3.8981,0.291,4.7506,2.5929,6.1717,1.1877,3.2068,0.3472,7.3323,0.8255,0.5999,0.0002,3.3921,0.6782,3.7087,2.4982,0.6431,1.6097,1.2333,4.1661,2.8889,0.1455,6.4808,0.8322,1.2577,1.388,0.942,3.6549,0.2583,4.5136,4.6246,2.8672,2.3629,4.9617,4.6541,7.2322,0.7546,2.8228,1.0802,3.2678,0.0741,0.9949,3.0608,0.6931,0.9795,0.5202,3.3039,3.3045,6.069,4.5089,5.0681,0.973,0.9562,0.6389,0.3473,0.0002,2.0356,2.8263,0.4139,0.0283,1.8504,1.3162,4.2244,0.4975,2.2528,3.4398,0.1291,3.5868,1.7523,2.8055,0.5809,0.5588,3.9303,1.8346,2.2708,6.7754,0.1334,0.3869,6.3196,8.9407,2.4615,5.6264,1.7005,4.9803,0.3791,2.4788,1.2432,1.2409,0.5388,0.1239,1.4994,0.0302,0.2338]}

Recording is currently underway in Seattle by the band and producer Josh Wilbur.\n\n\"Jerry Cantrell is currently hard at work on writing and recording his own material. The project is still under wraps but should provide something of a musical surprise to fans of the band.\"\n\nNow Alice in Chains founder Alice Cooper is telling AllMusic that Cantrell has already laid down his parts and the recording process has begun. Apparently it's \"90% done\" [32].\n\nI've talked to Jerry today, and he's got his parts in. It's 90% done, he told me.... So we're making some progress.\n\nAsked about the possible influences for Alice in Chains' next LP, Alice Cooper told AllMusic:\n\n\"Well, this album is not necessarily a throwback album. It's definitely an Alice in Chains album. I just can't tell you what songs are going to be on it.\n\nCooper also said that Cantrell \"is getting a little old,\" although adding \"There's certainly a new dimension to it now. It didn't have any of that dimension before this year. Now you can tell it's an Alice in Chains record. We're just gonna keep on going. If it sounds good, put it out. And it's sounding good!\"\n\nAlice Cooper is currently working his tour through Europe in April, then is scheduled to return to the States in May. He will then likely be touring through the summer and fall of 2012. So it would seem as though fans can expect Alice in Chains' latest studio album later this year.\n\nWhat do you think so far about Alice in Chains' upcoming fifth studio album? Do you like songs such as 'Flesh and Blood' and 'Shame Shame'?

Fowler also got a yellow card in the previous round which kept him out of the second tie against Bristol City. His suspension cost him the next four games [which ended in a 3-1 defeat to Norwich City]. The following day, manager Mark McGhee stated that Fowler would miss at least the next two games with a hip injury, and later a further four weeks as the injury required surgery. This was the second operation against the player.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult season,\u201d Fowler noted. \u201cI\u2019ve had problems with my hip for about six years and that\u2019s probably why I\u2019ve been playing with a little bit of discomfort. I\u2019ve had the operation twice before which was a success, but it wasn\u2019t a complete cure. Obviously I\u2019ve got a few hurdles to get over at the moment, and a lot of hard work to put in.\"","token_len":503,"entropy":[8.5633,2.7291,4.7654,15.0688,5.6643,0.563,2.1591,18.3348,7.6518,6.5924,7.2078,0.8095,2.6381,2.1918,1.1125,6.4654,1.7877,1.034,1.8556,5.8624,1.1953,3.0981,6.9852,4.6426,6.1485,2.4353,0.0053,1.4889,5.8817,0.0043,0.7525,1.8474,5.5929,2.2964,1.6105,2.4114,3.4327,1.8275,4.6276,1.4529,2.1364,0.0399,0.9578,0.0065,0.6822,4.0065,0.3376,1.9626,2.0153,3.2636,7.9918,0.1855,0.0252,1.2575,1.0386,6.4688,11.9265,1.2932,2.0443,8.079,4.3665,0.0007,1.979,4.209,5.4188,2.1975,2.3929,4.8543,4.1778,0.6363,0.2928,7.5664,4.7347,0.9325,8.2039,4.9562,0.4661,4.5395,3.3825,5.2699,11.7663,5.503,7.4487,6.7364,2.3917,1.5354,2.6386,8.9947,0.3947,1.3318,1.9648,1.3467,0.0179,0.5321,2.5619,1.3962,4.6474,2.0977,3.5587,0.7776,2.1125,1.8931,3.6669,5.0423,6.1019,6.3281,1.5122,3.4312,1.2486,1.647,4.8875,0.8903,1.0867,4.4158,5.6425,6.4598,2.3901,2.6367,4.3438,1.0974,8.3962,1.5062,2.136,7.3241,6.7016,2.5478,1.6838,4.46,1.7694,2.1603,5.5036,3.311,5.2891,1.1009,1.84,6.5571,1.5858,5.6433,3.6602,3.5208,1.2555,2.1127,3.7547,0.6111,2.2852,0.0259,4.1921,2.0433,5.46,1.5966,0.6083,0.6344,4.3139,7.5934,2.5569,4.8613,4.8792,4.885,3.7163,2.786,2.0328,2.367,5.6673,3.6698,1.2209,2.483,2.1561,1.2255,5.9191,4.9868,3.5179,2.0099,0.2886,4.0834,2.7464,2.8228,3.1772,3.6448,2.7996,4.6594,0.0396,1.0882,2.4956,5.9081,3.2998,4.8665,1.4713,1.6326,4.2187,1.7034,2.399,1.5768,0.0002,5.9034,2.697,1.7877,4.6743,0.9344,2.4159,3.0315,1.1652,4.036,3.7433,1.5112,0.9979,2.2714,1.3972,2.3642,3.9563,2.977,3.9294,0.6103,2.2896,3.6674,3.3045,2.5999,0.8494,5.6901,2.3911,0.0305,4.0373,1.1576,3.2604,3.8976,0.769,0.0396,0.2969,1.4928,1.5769,4.3759,3.8403,3.3075,5.6578,3.6038,3.4952,0.3326,6.2279,2.0865,5.1607,2.9949,1.4667,2.3463,1.0158,0.8784,6.6211,3.2203,1.8316,2.2388,3.1863,1.7734,0.4189,0.0003,3.8221,8.682,1.5934,1.1607,0.0002,4.8418,5.5121,2.3589,1.3496,0.2001,1.9808,3.0541,0.5664,1.3012,1.9242,7.7634,4.7406,5.6452,2.1521,2.5971,3.1312,1.3322,0.0054,0.1983,0.8292,4.7833,1.7911,1.4846,1.7451,4.1014,0.5702,6.6617,0.1813,0.101,1.1017,1.877,2.9818,4.3388,0.5053,7.1099,3.1454,1.1664,6.3665,4.3015,2.276,4.7554,1.9693,7.1032,7.6814,7.3245,7.4889,7.7946,2.141,3.5613,4.5184,0.5577,2.5551,0.23,0.3875,1.7897,3.8127,4.7723,1.2038,1.7783,0.1992,2.5699,0.7289,5.4961,4.0052,6.3916,5.8996,0.1455,0.412,0.317,0.5092,4.2083,6.1791,2.0566,4.1653,0.3476,0.8965,4.2942,3.9705,6.0612,0.7152,1.7701,3.4532,3.0456,0.6796,8.8337,6.2767,2.7642,1.1879,1.2192,2.3064,0.0311,1.0658,0.9033,0.7333,4.3315,1.4264,1.2821,4.2153,1.9675,2.2434,2.0824,7.2203,3.5547,5.0508,0.8538,4.5385,0.968,0.5779,1.523,2.5193,3.3593,0.0447,1.964,0.5302,1.3447,0.9888,3.3197,0.4725,5.4452,0.4653,1.826,1.8001,6.2265,5.5837,4.7341,2.5698,3.5583,4.4047,3.1941,3.319,4.2796,2.0259,0.533,4.8803,1.7855,2.3857,2.4636,9.8098,5.61,2.5052,5.251,2.706,0.6053,0.0002,9.5512,8.1241,6.7901,14.2097,8.6873,2.5293,3.0075,1.1473,2.5302,2.0247,3.2991,7.8408,7.9826,4.6677,6.707,0.6657,5.6416,0.6917,2.1714,4.7201,4.1225,3.0029,1.5385,6.055,0.8087,1.084,2.564,3.0467,3.9735,2.8089,3.0582,2.168,3.4853,2.6009,2.6438,3.4572,4.5136,1.5361,0.5243,4.8048,0.3108,0.3647,0.9461,3.3257,3.8252,1.8017,3.3267,1.0757,0.7104,2.9002,1.1702,1.1686,3.2115,0.0876,0.3403,1.2421,3.8067,6.1765,4.5783,2.8905,4.6846,1.3705,2.4817,4.9229,1.5411,1.5979,1.8005,3.4436,0.1968,0.7297,0.045,2.5521,3.9415,4.9263,0.7838,6.8693,1.5342,4.2182,0.0338,0.2386,2.3312,1.6783,4.0315,8.7793,1.9127,3.1903,2.7116,5.4598,0.8034,0.8567,0.9894,2.3669,4.5039,1.4879,0.1989,4.8664,0.0866,2.6333,2.7955,0.3177,3.9996]}

In 1823 a local resident, Thomas Smith, found fragments of flint implements that were believed to be part of the Bronze Age.\n\nOn further searches of these heaps two more Bronze Age arrow heads were discovered by local school children. A local school had been organised by the Rev. Thomas White who was to found the school in 1815. A school has been operating in Werneth until the 19th century. In 1815 the Rev. Thomas White opened a school in Werneth which is still in existence in 2004. The school is part of the community centre Werneth. The local residents donated land to the school, where the school building is situated, so that they could expand the premises. The Rev. Thomas White was ordained in 1805 and he was later appointed minister in Werneth from 1820 up to 1845. He was succeeded by Rev. A.B.C. White. Rev. James Smith, the Rev. J.F. Brown (1827-1840) and Mr. Smith (1843-1845). This school was operated in turn by the Church of England (Methodist) and the church (Presbyterian) (now United Reformed Church). The Methodist church has closed and the church is now United Reformed Church.\n\nThe Reverend D. White also noticed a number of Bronze Age stones with some flint arrows heads at Werneth. He reported on his findings about the stone and arrow heads to the Earl of Pembroke on January 25th 1821.\n\nWerneth is situated on the A6 near the Werneth Road and is about 3\/4 mile north south. The closest motorway junction is M606 junction 7 at Huddersfield to the north and the local station is Huddersfield (3.5 miles away) which has links with Manchester Piccadilly via Leeds.

{"id":2414,"ended":true,"length":480,"text":"`` Natural vision correction `` or `` natural vision improvement `` continues to be marketed by practitioners offering individual instruction, many of who have no medical or optometric credentials. Most base their approach on the theory that the human eye itself can be operated upon to achieve vision correction. The eye itself has two parts, a ciliary muscle, that causes the lens to be positioned near the end of the eye, and four eyelids which regulate the amount of light entering the lens. The eyelids are actually connected to a system of muscles, which, in turn, make up a system of muscles, known as the `` lid lift and blink reflex `` That system makes the eye turn quickly to blink more effectively. When the eye turns quickly, part of that time is lost in seeing because the eye is actually only on the line to blink. An alternative position is found at the back of the eye. This position allows most of a scene to pass the eye. This position is where the natural or `` non-corrected `` vision of most people occurs. It is natural and requires no eye surgery. It is also the position which we have evolved into with the use of small foveated lenses for our eyes. So why do people have vision problems? There are two fundamental reasons :\n\n`` 1 : eye shape. `` The structure of the eyes limits the field of sight which can be seen at an object. `` 2 : eye movement. `` Due to the lack of ability to correct the eye's position when necessary, when the eye is forced into an unnatural position by artificial vision aids of the past, the lenses become strained and cause discomfort at the most critical part of the eye : the fovea. With the advent of small foveated lenses and the ability of these lenses to take into account normal human eye movement, such uncomfortable lenses and eye discomfort can be overcome. Small foveated lenses are now available to correct all types of defects resulting in natural correction. These lenses are safe, effective and comfortable... all of which can be verified through eye exams.\n\nThis position is where most of a scene passes the eye. This is also the position which causes the best vision in the shortest amount of time as it involves the least strain on the eye. This position is where the natural or `` non-corrected `` vision of most people occurs. It is natural and requires no eye surgery. It is also the position which we have evolved into with the use of small foveated lenses for our eyes.","token_len":504,"entropy":[11.5192,9.024,8.6905,11.3713,7.5578,0.6621,4.5864,1.3191,4.4572,0.2854,11.257,0.3192,0.525,7.5536,2.958,9.2354,7.3783,8.3732,8.0903,3.2781,7.4774,0.2899,6.0894,2.056,3.7843,3.9208,3.2101,5.3092,1.7767,4.8313,1.2288,5.8507,10.9906,0.7886,5.2951,0.1513,1.4901,4.3366,0.3994,2.0141,3.5421,0.6847,6.7907,2.5872,1.6812,6.0556,4.207,4.0369,3.7744,2.9503,1.7503,0.9359,2.4677,5.0787,3.6467,2.7946,3.6203,4.2299,1.6347,2.0691,6.1669,0.7229,5.595,1.9447,3.3486,6.958,1.2673,4.8539,0.171,2.1256,4.0345,4.1406,0.2392,5.5325,0.0345,0.1759,1.5859,1.4672,0.4484,7.9273,7.8932,0.5678,4.8372,4.997,0.8499,3.8033,0.0911,0.1742,2.2156,0.4761,3.137,0.5336,1.2711,3.2017,0.1565,1.2616,6.3294,3.1688,0.8811,2.4679,4.8462,0.7319,3.1894,2.7843,2.0342,3.9474,1.8395,0.1178,0.0013,5.071,1.0515,3.1666,3.3209,0.1135,2.2543,2.8198,4.4886,0.0542,0.5609,6.3616,9.9909,10.0929,4.673,8.1638,3.3632,1.6502,9.2198,3.0153,4.4908,1.4944,1.5181,4.3017,5.0078,2.1522,6.5561,6.2229,4.868,0.9554,4.0751,0.8843,1.124,1.9118,2.1964,0.743,7.6971,0.0292,3.4899,6.529,0.9333,2.93,2.6664,7.1804,4.811,0.898,2.3585,1.8338,5.3603,5.0548,6.0295,0.7048,7.0073,4.5422,2.384,0.7208,5.322,4.4927,6.6454,1.1093,5.7533,3.3046,0.3861,3.3061,0.1374,0.06,0.1833,2.1646,2.5201,1.1405,2.8597,6.7746,1.9888,4.9745,8.4057,0.2389,4.5237,5.2704,0.2499,2.8133,2.9851,1.0148,1.1694,4.7672,0.916,4.9052,6.1119,6.7777,7.0164,0.4451,8.2663,2.5259,2.7318,1.7287,3.2016,4.226,1.4244,4.0676,0.4051,2.8404,0.6002,7.7972,3.5888,5.0125,1.2927,5.8362,2.7456,0.7827,2.4941,0.6702,2.0636,3.2817,1.5373,4.1506,6.2117,2.7785,5.6389,4.1753,4.1893,1.4065,2.9269,0.0055,6.4724,7.0559,0.7587,4.9129,2.7332,3.1362,3.8426,0.8317,0.5594,5.9997,4.5514,1.9552,2.5546,3.0707,5.6515,0.7549,1.2103,3.6551,0.3696,1.2379,5.3053,0.5073,8.4769,4.4747,0.5381,6.6744,5.572,4.7366,6.6848,4.8672,3.6807,3.2079,3.2828,6.2282,0.152,0.2786,2.6522,9.0817,0.9408,5.3975,0.1124,5.5622,3.9832,2.2489,0.8639,2.2153,3.5699,3.803,5.9881,1.2059,1.9061,1.0258,0.0436,2.2782,3.8525,0.3312,0.3288,6.3897,0.003,0.5562,3.7421,0.0074,6.9342,0.4085,5.4175,1.5981,1.0658,2.6006,2.9655,4.1808,6.9507,0.3338,5.6053,1.4955,0.7997,1.0437,5.4389,2.4781,2.3341,2.7033,0.4157,2.9324,6.3117,4.8115,4.5339,5.703,1.5598,6.6897,0.4902,1.8319,7.6072,3.7988,6.4517,1.1224,5.1744,4.951,4.0878,0.7209,5.6983,3.3797,5.4645,0.0482,0.1537,0.3094,5.2713,0.2022,5.5486,0.0148,0.1288,0.4148,5.6872,1.308,3.4879,0.011,3.5593,0.9555,0.0042,0.1604,0.2179,3.2502,1.437,3.7245,2.1489,4.0498,1.4023,0.1197,5.5466,3.465,0.0764,5.8938,3.8537,3.323,0.6969,0.4693,5.5014,8.494,5.9001,4.1243,4.0777,4.1079,1.5079,0.6736,3.6059,0.9041,6.2323,0.592,0.003,0.0411,0.1594,1.7744,4.638,1.4834,1.8561,7.0098,5.0651,3.2263,0.0142,6.5274,6.5753,1.5529,5.6642,6.065,1.5987,3.2286,0.6064,1.1043,6.9053,1.8524,2.1869,0.8695,4.8282,6.8777,5.9966,1.9931,0.5589,2.9964,0.2787,6.7452,3.3575,4.6392,3.0909,1.0963,2.6687,0.0017,4.0179,5.551,1.1482,3.1225,1.994,0.6895,1.0478,0.0204,2.1738,0.1972,0.0348,0.5444,2.0071,1.3847,2.8861,1.2331,0.4098,0.786,7.6642,0.7592,6.6202,2.4987,2.7112,1.8338,5.8093,1.0669,0.0046,0.0048,4.6222,2.6097,5.316,1.4895,4.8086,6.6889,0.8666,0.0876,0.8332,0.5448,2.5217,0.76,0.6259,1.0245,1.0006,0.3895,0.1439,0.3901,0.376,0.0037,0.0124,0.0026,0.0993,0.0799,0.0581,0.0179,0.005,0.0361,0.0847,0.5788,0.0747,0.3594,0.0368,0.0117,0.0054,0.0018,0.001,0.0494,0.317,0.0142,0.0073,0.0197,0.0054,0.0054,0.0036,0.003,0.0163,0.0025,0.0049,0.0046,0.0001,0.0004,0.0286,0.0042,0.0004,0.0004,0.0066,0.0074,0.0023,0.0018,0.0163]}
{"id":1131,"ended":false,"length":444,"text":"Biographers Fraser and Navarro wrote that Eva Per\u00f3n has often been credited with gaining the right to vote for Argentine women. While Eva did make radio addresses in support of women's suffrage and she met with women who were lobbying for it. She didn't work to end gender discrimination, she didn't fight for women's rights. Eva was simply in-sync with the times and she used \"gender equality\" to get what she wanted.\n\nThis is why I find her statements about women leaders to be so patronizing, especially when compared to this statement.\n\nIt is also why I find the use of \"feminazis\" by men who would never vote for her to be so laughable. To her credit, Per\u00f3n did speak out against them and it was a great way for them to discredit her. Feminazis are today's equivalent of \"rednecks\" who opposed women's suffrage in the 1930s.\n\nFeminists in the 1930s used the redneck term in opposition to women's suffrage and were often violent. That said, I agree that feminism has gone too far with the victimization complex and I know that some feminists have become obnoxious. I also know that the Redneck is a term meant mockingly and sarcastically and that I don't want them to be thought of as what many feminists today have become.\n\nEva Per\u00f3n was not the first woman to use the term \"feminazi\" in opposition to feminism and she definitely wasn't the last. I think I last read about it in an old issue of Playboy. My favorite part:\n\n\"They are the kind of hysterical, over-sensitized female who sees man as a boogieman, and woman as a goddess and the world in flames.\n\n\"She is the kind of feminazi who, if her man takes a bite of a banana, runs to the kitchen and rips the banana apart. When the kitchen comes under suspicion, the hunt is on.\n\n\"She goes to the hairdresser's just before the next hair-do, and is horrified to find that even the hairdresser has had Botox.\n\n\"She sees a little pink car in the showroom, and is thrilled. When she gets back in the house, she discovers that her husband has bought her an identical car. She accuses him of buying her an identical car at the same time he bought her hair color and a new dress.\"","token_len":504,"entropy":[10.5752,13.0989,0.9995,8.7797,1.3024,4.5029,1.8233,12.2706,6.6584,4.7715,4.8677,4.9576,1.0259,4.1067,0.7378,7.2094,2.0024,4.0793,0.1494,3.5432,2.4375,7.8139,4.7055,1.5639,4.9183,3.9396,4.2554,5.269,10.4233,6.6687,1.5757,3.5674,0.0466,2.5163,0.484,1.3415,0.0008,2.4091,5.1857,6.9275,1.4117,3.6945,2.5868,1.8139,9.5774,0.4715,1.9894,3.7138,2.2637,5.5144,0.0005,6.3284,4.0118,4.5985,5.41,0.8467,1.5506,1.4559,3.453,0.0001,3.6095,0.5656,2.543,0.052,0.9265,1.9779,4.3409,1.8449,5.1074,5.0919,7.301,4.0277,0.0858,0.9362,5.1884,1.6099,1.9958,5.9272,6.4482,4.4027,3.0435,0.2423,0.8352,3.4971,2.2905,0.1166,0.277,0.393,1.007,0.0044,4.1114,1.5146,2.9434,2.4858,4.3709,2.6554,5.0319,3.1557,2.6258,8.7262,2.2303,0.0386,2.1961,5.7638,0.0567,2.6685,2.2384,0.9614,2.3562,0.2085,5.7878,5.3451,4.224,2.0079,0.0002,3.6807,1.0807,2.5986,2.8217,0.6495,2.265,2.3295,5.2127,0.0109,2.0638,2.8274,5.8781,0.4375,0.1016,3.895,5.6059,3.343,4.6026,3.507,3.1676,0.485,2.9164,1.8265,0.0804,2.8739,5.9654,0.2823,5.0746,5.3322,0.3424,0.1483,3.6736,0.0177,3.0292,2.598,0.6354,0.6761,5.8525,1.867,3.9077,1.2176,2.6358,3.6961,2.8914,1.4132,3.1928,0.0161,4.8652,0.4706,0.6269,7.4568,0.1596,0.0046,0.8665,9.1118,2.7273,3.4958,0.1715,2.8554,6.3911,2.1283,0.0005,0.7009,1.0061,7.0712,3.207,0.3475,0.7915,0.0016,2.8626,0.689,3.626,0.0382,0.8089,1.1333,0.0001,4.9727,0.0617,3.9373,4.4659,1.5753,3.4312,0.0046,3.8773,1.7586,8.3147,2.3967,4.3593,4.1615,4.2295,0.0238,0.9226,0.4362,0.2286,0.0011,2.215,4.0329,4.2102,6.9528,1.4752,4.6627,3.6118,0.0462,3.3103,4.5411,1.2805,4.3004,1.9323,5.2592,2.4013,0.0028,3.4932,1.8923,8.5544,0.4883,11.462,1.5458,2.7083,4.3439,1.0345,2.8723,1.5535,2.1882,4.8641,9.4514,2.1365,2.0267,2.2262,1.6791,0.2233,2.9338,3.9897,1.9615,4.0637,1.8573,3.6058,5.7191,11.6917,0.2088,2.1532,5.5507,0.0004,2.964,1.6046,3.0129,2.8132,0.0006,3.2019,3.6465,0.7604,1.4365,5.9687,0.2584,0.131,6.8158,5.1265,1.985,4.2108,4.486,2.0688,0.3034,0.6699,0.0001,6.3695,0.8654,0.0094,2.4609,2.3445,2.3442,0.6924,1.4453,0.4737,2.4385,0.5817,0.7145,0.6403,0.8529,1.381,0.6148,1.664,1.4561,0.0123,2.6014,2.5922,2.3701,5.383,0.9466,0.0003,0.0442,0.9224,0.2045,2.7298,2.3052,4.0092,8.8986,3.8876,2.0131,2.5495,0.9966,2.4862,5.5563,4.9874,0.3261,4.2148,2.0055,5.6627,3.3265,2.8601,5.5145,1.0724,0.0001,1.9188,5.0671,2.7031,2.5523,5.9485,0.2015,9.1497,1.7767,5.9126,0.9352,4.7815,1.3073,2.1586,7.3342,3.7685,7.6252,6.8898,0.9858,1.1226,7.7027,5.8719,0.0022,1.1423,2.2161,3.3001,0.0308,0.5166,6.0166,2.8402,3.6102,4.5529,4.6071,7.4209,1.3091,4.311,0.0003,1.7168,3.6298,1.9272,1.8132,2.484,0.0691,6.2259,0.118,0.3933,4.04,2.8363,3.8063,5.3476,5.435,2.7716,5.1013,1.4749,1.8816,3.567,0.6436,6.214,2.552,0.731,3.1175,1.0485,6.1704,0.9054,1.8454,1.7011,4.102,1.5632,5.1057,2.1565,6.8608,3.8423,5.1575,8.7826,0.4645,2.4177,10.5516,1.5399,0.6301,1.2667,1.2498,0.0003,0.1182,1.3701,5.5809,1.0427,0.8748,8.7972,0.1577,0.045,0.0355,2.2791,8.6228,3.1082,1.8288,4.1858,6.825,1.689,5.1909,2.2187,1.6039,4.0662,4.8202,1.2858,0.6842,0.9436,6.1602,1.4407,2.2483,0.0056,0.018,0.0943,2.1891,5.1223,12.3058,0.0127,2.042,0.9508,0.0003,0.0548,0.7956,4.7243,1.7775,5.0135,6.1768,7.2149,2.7335,0.4484,9.0386,0.1678,1.0805,0.8648,2.5477,5.5849,4.1171,3.0716,1.3018,2.5671,2.8308,3.1175,0.7928,2.8905,0.2783,0.51,5.0967,0.3449,2.4612,1.9777,1.236,4.6055,1.1581,2.9874,5.3593,1.281,0.9301,1.8527,7.0253,0.7903,0.0552,3.6891,0.515,1.8541,0.2262,0.1668,4.9429,1.1134,0.5334,0.2445,3.6279,2.0394,0.2496,7.0198,5.6825,2.9143,3.9371,3.1046,4.4189,1.9899]}

Allmovie reviewer Michael Hastings commented that the band `` has managed to stay fresh and inventive after more than a decade together ``, praising their ``southern-fried rock stylings ``. Although critics largely agreed that the group \"has a natural charm about them, \" Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine described The White Stripes as an ``annoying band,`` which had grown \"dull\" over the years. The Austin Chronicle similarly described the album as \"not bad, though it's not very interesting.\" At the time of the album's release, Rolling Stone was even more critical, stating that ``It isn't pretty, but it is an awfully good album.''\n\nThe album was the first of many for the White Stripes. With their success as a group, the band began touring regularly and opened for a variety of artists, including the Rolling Stones and Jack White.

Lotus chose not to take up an option on Vitaly Petrov's contract, and did not offer Bruno Senna a new contract. Petrov and Senna were the final drivers who had competed for the team during the 2009 season to remain in F1.\n\nLotus will retain technical director James Allison and managing director Adrian Newey.\n\nLotus will be known as Caterham in 2013.\n\nLotus said the team failed to make the final because of \"serious financial instability\" and said it had been forced into a \"crisis management\" situation because of the financial implications.\n\n\"The new owners decided that we simply were not able to keep up with the cost of doing the business,\" said the team in a statement.\n\n\"On reflection, they saw it as a betrayal to their other teams and drivers to leave them exposed to the continuing uncertainty caused by our inability to fulfil our obligations to our staff and suppliers.\n\n\"The lack of any alternative in the current economic climate, which would have been more robust in meeting the investment needs of an endurance team, also played a part.\"\n\nLast season Lotus scored only seven points, all from Senna in the Brazilian Grand Prix. It took part in only two races in 2012.\n\nAerodynamically behind the current field as well as financially underperforming, the team had been considering going into administration before finalising the sale to a consortium led by Chinese businessman Chen Tianfu.\n\nThe team will continue to race in 2013, but also under the Caterham name.\n\n\"It was important to the new investors that the team retain its place in the sport next season. We are therefore in the process of finalising the arrangements with the new owners in order to maintain this commitment,\" said the team.\n\nLotus Racing director Graeme Lowdon left the team early on Monday.\n\n\"This has been a distressing time, but the new owners recognise the importance of retaining the team's assets, which now become part of their overall business,\" said Lotus.\n\n\"We were faced with a stark choice between ceasing all operations or finding a way to survive on a reduced budget, with the consequent loss to the team and its fans.\n\n\"Our inability to fulfil our financial obligations and to compete at the front of the pack without serious investment meant we had no other choice but to make the necessary and painful decision to close operations.\"","token_len":505,"entropy":[8.3965,3.735,2.1627,4.9782,10.4598,2.6209,2.129,7.4459,6.2081,3.3329,0.0058,4.1472,3.5202,4.1406,1.7281,2.3971,10.8906,1.6768,0.3124,0.007,2.2206,1.0006,1.4926,2.02,6.0566,0.702,3.2875,8.7255,1.5206,0.1519,1.2785,1.5196,0.8187,1.0021,4.7875,0.0002,4.3902,2.5829,0.0011,1.8285,3.6586,5.3933,2.6557,4.4264,3.0369,5.6525,1.6966,1.0039,1.4449,4.1204,0.4137,4.3027,0.242,6.4796,5.8527,1.4618,3.565,0.0277,0.5994,0.8594,0.0004,4.158,0.0001,4.3068,4.5299,6.916,0.5979,5.5722,1.7911,1.6951,7.1825,0.0265,4.9304,1.2787,0.0026,2.4782,1.4614,0.0002,3.3131,0.0001,2.689,3.0778,5.7518,0.8655,6.5456,0.0004,2.1704,3.4777,1.1351,1.0451,0.0002,2.5939,0.0001,4.6897,2.0889,1.7921,9.1367,0.1161,2.8245,1.7987,3.6479,8.3497,0.5395,3.2034,4.5307,3.0443,6.5362,1.363,1.3408,4.5719,0.9446,2.0412,2.4543,3.007,2.8175,1.3506,1.7422,4.3684,0.4856,3.0367,0.9312,2.4861,3.9333,0.2421,1.5906,2.6798,6.5609,1.3795,0.3079,0.0002,1.0379,2.0909,6.5792,3.3849,4.9173,1.8864,1.9734,6.4932,4.2116,0.2655,2.679,0.004,3.7335,3.0025,0.2222,0.6558,5.3552,0.235,3.804,8.2647,1.8486,1.8608,1.1703,1.8165,0.5524,2.4493,0.2,0.1056,0.1525,0.6725,0.0003,0.2067,5.5009,5.3932,0.5307,2.9841,4.6412,3.06,0.3909,0.9257,5.8345,1.6243,2.094,7.1974,3.905,1.156,5.5455,1.6152,4.5354,2.526,6.6854,1.0571,1.4726,7.1504,4.5786,3.637,0.0426,3.1707,4.012,0.011,5.6181,0.8464,3.0621,1.4429,2.0575,5.0285,0.8603,3.7847,1.088,0.257,0.0003,0.0196,2.3831,4.9079,0.0026,4.5618,6.1591,4.4751,1.265,3.5079,4.9974,0.9025,2.6394,2.3847,4.7052,1.5443,2.1851,4.6109,6.7,2.4806,8.3991,1.3167,5.6963,2.11,0.1363,6.1517,8.9376,1.8424,0.5429,4.8918,4.9615,0.5347,2.2658,2.4401,0.3299,0.0002,5.3794,3.1846,3.5441,6.0032,4.1077,3.4066,0.4324,2.1301,6.5037,2.1841,6.6217,0.0057,3.302,1.0147,6.5354,0.351,0.0005,0.6013,4.2626,4.4996,6.7505,0.0355,3.8361,1.6861,1.4799,1.4708,2.6131,1.7033,0.5269,0.0002,3.7125,10.1748,2.0776,0.1201,8.4638,0.6943,4.5621,8.1038,6.4117,2.2222,0.5394,6.7578,4.8413,1.5906,1.0643,1.2958,0.5195,3.2315,1.9833,6.6301,5.3434,1.7041,3.9324,4.1247,6.2513,0.0619,1.0794,2.784,2.0761,3.6121,2.1751,1.2255,0.0055,5.4221,3.1839,4.1293,5.176,3.9268,0.5098,0.3189,0.0003,1.9566,1.8858,3.3727,3.3351,0.4705,5.45,1.3386,3.623,1.4281,1.5425,5.3297,6.3111,1.2551,6.6524,0.0042,2.7241,0.8925,0.7557,0.0003,2.4968,2.882,2.071,3.131,0.8212,3.6851,5.0846,6.9941,0.8179,2.205,0.8499,4.8065,1.3824,4.2899,0.5836,1.1858,3.0572,6.6491,0.605,2.969,1.379,2.0947,6.2866,3.9352,1.4082,0.4921,0.0023,3.4401,0.035,1.4857,6.5585,1.9467,1.5146,2.4043,0.1921,3.9869,0.72,0.0391,4.2535,4.1236,5.5315,0.8246,0.6855,1.846,0.2311,0.7233,0.3581,0.0003,2.9899,0.0001,5.0524,3.9027,7.7613,0.0084,6.3508,6.5182,7.8317,0.9142,0.4386,4.9192,2.4045,4.0247,1.6462,0.5308,0.0002,0.5635,3.875,2.9012,0.2957,0.55,8.7877,0.0315,1.8976,4.3079,1.4785,2.4358,3.8506,0.2623,5.3995,1.3384,1.8562,0.1031,4.5227,1.0243,1.9816,2.0557,6.8316,1.9342,2.2591,5.3901,6.1999,3.1346,0.0046,3.1161,3.7121,2.0945,1.3008,1.4544,6.6648,1.5629,0.3544,0.0003,0.3006,1.3337,3.9248,6.3055,0.0186,1.0988,6.9931,0.1291,1.5711,9.3193,0.0049,5.3922,1.9979,2.5075,5.4832,0.8479,2.8794,0.4985,4.8032,3.5036,1.6205,4.4811,1.228,2.2771,3.0378,1.3179,8.0514,0.0028,1.0619,6.203,1.1854,0.9188,2.0235,1.7287,3.4573,0.9297,0.3407,0.0003,0.0253,3.7471,7.0853,0.0229,4.2223,0.6198,3.0637,0.6124,2.3236,2.0813,4.2115,2.1956,0.8833,5.4989,0.3206,0.1947,1.9467,5.7651,5.4377,4.0724,4.9344,1.3883,1.4814,2.1017,3.0449,1.064,0.6854,0.0194,2.9946,1.108,3.8284,4.9607,4.703,1.958,0.8867,3.1363,5.8772,1.4012]}

{"id":3591,"ended":false,"length":466,"text":"Stead won the annual Newbery Medal recognizing When You Reach Me as the year's `` most distinguished contribution to American literature for children ``. The judges chose the novel for making the small, seemingly inconsequential details of childhood memorable.\n\n``In a world where we sometimes forget what children are, This Is Where I Leave You makes us remember,`` the judges wrote in their announcement of the honor.\n\n``There s a reason the authors of the great literary classics often write tales from their childhoods,`` author-editor Janet Reid, chief operating officer of the American Library Association, said by telephone. ``It makes things more immediate. You re dealing with experience.``\n\nStead grew up on a Minnesota dairy farm but had to quit her own education to work to support herself and her two younger siblings after her father died in his 50s.\n\nShe later turned to writing as a career and teaches writing in the University of Pennsylvania s Creative Writing Program.\n\nThe judges felt Stead was most successful in her use of detail in describing food and clothing in the farm life of her book s characters. They singled out a section where the main characters have to settle their feud, ducking to avoid a pile of manure on a hot day, as a key example.\n\n``How often in the past have you found your friends in a pile of manure?`` their characters ask as they push their way to the surface. ``In fact, I know I have.``\n\nStead was surprised and gratified last week to be singled out for the honor, she told the Associated Press by telephone.\n\n``Being the favorite seems to have no real appeal,`` she said. ``You write books for yourself.``\n\n``I was happy to be selected this year,`` she said. ``It s a lifetime goal of mine to win the Newbery. I ve written five previous books that I really love. And each time my publisher has said, `Someday, you re going to win it.'``\n\n``This Is Where I Leave You`` is about a modern Manhattan family whose members are at odds after their youngest daughter returns home to help care for her aged father.\n\n``The Newbery puts a huge amount of weight on the work itself,`` Reid said. ''It's very rare for an editorial review of a book to put so much stock on the story and the writing and the craft than on the picture book itself.''","token_len":505,"entropy":[6.4392,9.7763,1.2137,7.5059,5.887,6.4843,3.1096,9.2354,14.5373,3.2909,5.0873,5.8734,4.5145,1.8493,6.952,0.1515,11.4628,9.1422,4.593,7.2628,0.273,3.6464,2.656,5.0278,6.0785,6.583,3.2293,2.4168,7.1495,4.989,2.3162,4.6076,2.8828,8.7501,1.057,8.9879,3.6963,7.4847,4.2144,0.0785,0.0006,6.9742,0.661,3.6638,5.7349,0.993,2.6699,0.0094,3.0636,4.0013,2.9565,2.7223,0.9637,3.3005,5.5878,2.6169,3.0289,3.003,1.5445,1.9618,6.5895,5.3444,3.9776,1.9028,5.2385,0.5171,5.6157,2.5677,2.6899,3.668,3.937,2.4593,3.2565,0.833,2.3538,1.1151,5.8559,2.1101,0.3978,5.4865,0.317,1.1336,0.0003,0.8381,4.2924,12.9532,1.6742,5.2529,3.5049,5.0565,1.413,2.6025,6.2891,4.2795,3.5576,5.8477,3.1978,6.0822,4.8844,1.7535,1.8023,1.3763,1.2728,0.5493,7.6607,4.8972,2.8023,6.1162,7.2123,3.205,7.0886,6.354,0.014,0.3314,1.3562,3.4027,1.9623,0.0213,0.2899,0.7399,5.0815,1.4597,0.6855,0.5651,2.4042,2.8777,6.2099,2.1715,7.6385,2.1068,3.8676,7.7025,18.3529,0.0541,7.9379,1.8389,5.6657,0.3841,0.0002,8.9935,0.0227,5.4862,0.0109,3.2489,1.2436,8.5227,5.0349,0.0319,5.0006,3.9856,2.852,5.3533,4.5958,5.1875,6.5765,1.4566,3.8957,5.4107,2.2738,2.2605,1.4527,0.1488,3.4557,2.9255,1.2348,3.885,2.2144,1.1684,0.9688,1.7805,5.1934,5.9389,0.016,0.1514,1.4224,0.0003,2.1639,5.0052,4.5814,0.4355,2.5713,2.9499,0.4218,1.9801,3.0687,8.7314,5.8098,2.9796,1.8977,4.3057,0.0629,4.2724,11.2265,8.1302,0.0401,1.4216,0.7102,0.793,0.0003,2.855,3.0969,6.2686,10.0886,1.803,5.7254,3.9571,1.5645,2.1177,4.77,0.011,6.8583,2.1802,4.365,8.3874,1.2795,3.596,3.1635,1.747,7.9057,5.6557,1.8658,1.3901,7.5429,7.4372,8.3158,0.6431,3.3125,5.9366,0.1125,3.2032,4.954,3.0622,2.0699,4.7979,1.8122,3.9464,1.8071,6.9367,3.7892,6.18,3.9669,7.6904,5.3206,3.4456,1.0538,2.9133,6.6574,0.2312,4.5464,3.0444,1.368,4.6632,1.8745,2.1602,2.8515,1.8132,3.4349,3.3768,0.8118,0.3132,0.0004,0.794,5.61,3.0922,5.0032,1.2927,3.7918,2.367,1.124,4.0651,4.4218,4.8905,3.2561,1.5727,5.4872,0.0915,0.3333,1.7027,2.9054,5.3605,5.4846,3.8791,3.888,0.3376,6.9468,2.2222,0.8203,2.7778,0.9651,5.4509,0.9618,2.3866,3.7129,4.6368,0.1684,2.5803,4.3757,3.3146,1.6705,3.3287,2.6164,0.3163,0.0003,1.5195,0.0032,3.2088,6.733,3.6059,5.285,0.0002,8.1921,1.8402,1.8911,3.0529,5.3285,0.0103,0.836,1.5752,2.1725,2.0807,3.2266,4.4365,1.5823,1.8694,0.0002,3.3202,1.3857,0.1977,0.5512,0.0003,0.9329,6.2707,3.139,7.3191,7.2025,1.1558,2.1538,5.1361,4.0272,5.6128,2.4158,1.163,0.1551,0.1297,0.2747,0.3419,3.5917,5.3905,5.2045,2.9272,4.1158,1.179,5.1615,0.4709,0.0003,4.2018,1.5901,3.3151,4.3725,0.7273,0.9983,3.3873,4.7668,0.2919,1.6035,0.6388,0.6158,0.5858,0.3191,0.4741,1.6516,6.3226,1.1651,9.6298,5.1324,2.106,0.1809,0.796,4.8727,1.327,2.9402,0.0095,2.9374,1.2069,11.6372,6.5184,5.0568,6.9859,1.373,3.1435,1.4836,5.055,2.8484,1.0546,3.4539,6.5149,2.0243,4.9558,5.2154,2.212,2.3363,0.9321,0.8235,6.3893,2.6263,0.0004,1.3347,1.2526,10.1548,5.5227,0.0722,2.6546,3.4683,1.852,1.3128,0.6095,0.0003,3.6634,3.3453,5.61,0.5232,0.117,0.0516,0.0166,5.1483,1.7448,5.0007,1.4973,8.4228,9.0945,1.8692,3.5278,7.2978,1.7956,5.6022,2.1685,5.0883,1.972,4.4666,1.2144,6.163,0.744,1.6711,4.5928,4.1414,0.0128,1.1607,7.5029,2.0183,0.756,0.5415,0.0004,2.0349,2.4776,5.378,0.0204,8.2249,2.2154,5.0103,3.415,0.0423,2.2603,0.2653,1.1269,6.0662,4.6451,0.9759,0.4902,2.509,0.1387,0.2682,4.7139,1.2817,2.0792,3.4535,6.0663,1.6799,3.1015,8.1714,5.7908,2.2955,0.5454,0.8081,0.5458,5.1137,3.348,0.0963,5.2125,4.0281,1.2167,2.1809,2.4713,1.5606,4.1993,3.1482,0.6133,5.0235,9.0825,3.9521,0.56,7.3934,5.3592,2.6035,1.4548]}
{"id":1076,"ended":true,"length":463,"text":"`` The Secret `` was directed by Dennie Gordon, who would go on to direct the season two episode `` Boys and Girls ``. Tom W. Chick portrayed Gil. The cast were mostly comprised of veterans of the show itself, including Billy Dee Williams ( Lando Calrissian ), James Doohan ( Scotty ), Lea Thompson ( Carol ) and, of course, Bill Kennedy ( Boba ).\n\nThere wasn't enough time for the cast to do a lot of filming on the set, so they did much of the scenes in make-up. The one thing that kept on repeating itself throughout every episode of The Clone Wars was the appearance of two different Jabba's Hutt puppets: the first was the one that had the big round head and a more realistic appearance. The second was a more realistic puppet of Jabba as he was seen at the end of the movie, except a little shorter.\n\nIt was revealed in the episode that Leia was the one who brought Luke to Jabba's palace. In that shot right before Jabba attacks Princess Leia, it shows his reflection in Luke's Force Crystal. It is believed that, as Darth Vader had no use for Force crystals, that Jabba would have destroyed them, but he didn't know what Luke's Force Crystal did.\n\nAnother Easter Egg is in the scene where Han and Leia have an argument. In the scene before it where they're sitting at the Jabba's table talking about being on the run, when they exit the throne room, Leia's blouse is visible.\n\nOther scenes include a shot towards the end of the episode that shows the Star Destroyer (Star Destroyer '') ''sailing near the planet. In the beginning of the episode, Jabba the Hutt is seen with two female Dancers ( Dancers ). The Dancer's are dressed in red with the body part from the neck down as the belt of Jabba's. When the scene cuts to another area, the dancers are seen as male dancers ( dancers ).\n\nWhen Luke gets rescued by Obi Wan and the Deathstar, he is rescued by Tie Fighters ( Tie Fighters ). They fly the same maneuver which was used by Boba Fett at the end of A New Hope ( Tie Fighters ).\n\nThe episode would introduce the new character Anakin '' s Padawan, Anakin Skywalker. ( Anakin Skywalker ). However, Anakin appeared at the start of season two, not in a prequel episode.","token_len":505,"entropy":[5.5719,8.9143,9.1999,7.4687,7.4928,1.3974,6.3559,5.464,3.0662,7.2369,1.3339,1.6968,4.6823,2.4411,0.0618,0.0183,3.9916,1.4642,6.7691,3.1604,2.6249,3.7302,10.6479,1.9203,0.2609,4.0518,1.6858,8.0286,4.93,2.8147,10.1732,8.6955,8.3719,2.7633,2.7721,3.99,5.005,3.7506,4.5457,0.022,6.3879,1.0716,0.4397,5.0121,7.2945,1.132,1.137,5.2597,3.3666,0.1153,1.9419,11.6924,2.3064,0.4694,0.0005,0.0014,0.0014,0.6795,4.7464,5.8552,0.6916,0.214,8.5202,0.1037,2.2518,7.7449,1.393,2.3695,0.0608,7.4497,3.2771,0.24,6.1041,1.3609,0.0142,0.0266,4.0982,8.9339,0.5281,4.8402,5.1547,7.5438,2.9318,0.475,5.5618,5.2196,0.0009,4.3705,1.2302,0.729,1.4931,2.9097,0.2193,3.6542,2.2317,2.5009,0.0854,3.1552,2.6554,0.8244,2.7439,1.2652,1.2305,1.7908,3.8026,6.171,0.4982,0.7342,6.2491,2.222,10.384,0.3934,0.5319,1.7054,2.0319,5.8822,2.7855,0.7381,3.2164,3.9248,6.9197,1.7726,2.7055,6.4862,0.8419,2.9313,3.4262,8.0262,0.0598,0.2675,1.2906,5.3201,0.042,4.7037,3.9933,7.4865,1.0398,1.7721,5.6093,0.0367,4.3474,0.0923,2.9581,2.0705,4.6966,1.5638,2.2295,3.6404,1.921,2.4289,2.3369,4.6859,6.1954,2.3746,1.4567,4.1607,5.6983,4.4416,3.7805,1.4593,1.3383,0.5338,0.7704,1.512,2.9447,2.2339,3.975,3.2761,3.3936,0.0203,5.2051,2.0512,1.651,2.6207,3.9479,0.5344,1.3013,0.0945,0.4972,3.5661,1.6288,6.7898,5.3129,2.1958,4.2395,1.1216,1.5201,0.0003,4.3222,0.9767,4.3401,1.5789,1.0649,2.5309,1.3415,7.5456,1.9998,2.3492,1.6163,0.7048,3.9554,4.9238,1.2012,3.442,0.0037,0.5128,2.1131,1.3166,3.4055,3.8997,6.0257,9.3911,0.9934,3.5095,0.0086,7.2092,5.217,0.0163,0.3389,3.8327,4.2138,5.4492,6.3903,1.6192,4.4078,0.065,9.2191,7.5405,1.1191,2.5898,2.1235,4.8114,0.266,5.2621,2.6207,5.8866,0.0791,3.7057,4.8074,5.223,0.018,5.9766,1.7434,0.5646,4.4537,3.7549,0.0044,2.6205,0.9285,5.5404,2.1698,2.7288,1.7065,2.3883,2.4487,0.0009,5.6461,2.3945,5.9326,1.669,2.2998,0.4037,4.4328,0.5314,1.3133,0.0002,5.0812,6.7629,0.8942,3.5857,3.2362,0.6641,5.8682,0.4928,3.6348,1.3644,0.7008,3.812,2.9378,1.7501,1.9673,2.7931,0.7785,2.0137,3.6322,4.2452,7.1377,2.1905,3.2164,4.1633,2.685,0.8652,5.6574,0.0871,0.1151,4.0851,3.8881,1.5246,5.8118,3.4078,0.9593,3.4348,0.589,4.881,2.2595,7.9791,0.6809,5.1578,0.0064,0.4014,2.3287,3.2083,8.9902,0.5882,0.9816,3.0361,1.1496,1.6762,0.0002,5.6315,6.2227,3.9545,2.111,3.4714,9.4714,0.0477,0.1632,0.339,0.4564,1.0114,4.3475,1.251,1.98,4.4937,0.2193,5.559,5.5092,0.6177,11.103,1.2004,11.455,3.275,9.6033,6.7185,0.6076,3.5895,3.0246,2.5336,0.9521,5.1992,0.5931,0.2171,0.6658,0.3644,3.4018,0.0388,5.246,0.2017,0.0005,1.7317,1.0453,3.3043,3.5043,7.0985,5.6318,7.2287,3.6019,6.0604,4.335,6.3612,2.1058,2.2339,2.5389,3.6165,5.9634,3.8793,0.5844,3.3749,3.7517,3.071,7.7099,4.1285,5.3075,0.5966,10.1058,0.4185,4.628,2.9503,7.8954,3.0459,4.4423,0.0148,0.965,5.02,3.9709,1.3902,4.5484,3.6085,0.2166,5.8005,5.0314,1.0717,1.3397,4.5606,1.0324,1.6943,4.7869,4.4587,3.2221,4.4101,6.8758,0.771,1.0334,0.0002,4.3469,2.206,4.3478,6.3854,0.9171,3.5409,3.0633,2.5573,2.4225,4.3009,8.5475,1.2498,1.1351,1.5862,6.7344,0.2581,9.9682,6.6237,1.7632,1.0048,0.017,0.9739,3.4787,5.3588,3.517,5.1211,8.8493,5.0031,2.603,0.242,1.5963,4.711,0.0033,0.0064,0.0002,4.2196,0.3475,0.7085,0.0129,6.1568,0.0385,0.0004,3.3639,6.3672,0.0487,0.3018,0.8823,0.0002,2.2585,4.1297,7.4641,5.8926,1.6349,3.5102,2.754,5.5171,0.0156,8.8334,9.0248,5.7633,4.6338,2.0782,5.8473,0.0155,1.0379,1.2469,5.5284,2.8533,0.0055,1.3164,3.4721,5.5587,0.0567,3.101,0.0024,6.3232,4.277,0.4365,3.5587,0.048,4.4272,0.9562,1.949,3.6373,2.1726,3.6204,4.789,0.3006,3.6241,1.5157]}

And, I didn't. I'm here for a few weeks a year on vacations. But, I am an Everglades advocate now. I see more of this country every day than I ever have,'' Douglas admitted.\n\nBut, if Douglas did nothing, the Everglades would be gone in 50 to 70 years because development would destroy every one of its miles of canals and levees.\n\n``So, if you had to pick a friend that I had here in Florida because everything else is going to get destroyed, I would say it's the water in the Everglades,'' she said.\n\nWhat does a typical day of Douglas' summer look like?\n\n``It's the same as yours -- I can do that,'' she said, laughing.\n\n``We don't need to be here. We've got a nice place in New York where we know everybody and have good friends, but I love it here. It is Florida. I am in my element here. It's so beautiful here. And, I feel safe. I feel really good here. When I go to New York, I have to go to these places where there's a policeman sitting on the corner and I think to myself: `God help me.'\n\n``I think I've got a good thing going here. I'm going to stick with that. When I get into a situation where the chips are down, I think I can handle it. I haven't always gotten the breaks in life where I was supposed to have gotten it but I always persevered so I can get through the rough times. I've really enjoyed the good times here. I don't look forward to the bad times.... My life has been enriched here,'' she said.\n\nDespite having won numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the National Medal of Arts and the Presidential Medal in the Arts from President Jimmy Carter, Douglas said she felt most honored during her last visit to Florida while governor.\n\n``To be in office in that capacity, and to visit every home in the state of Florida on a four-year term, it was humbling.

{"id":3017,"ended":true,"length":489,"text":"In general, three different types of sounds are produced by dolphins ( and other toothed whales ). These are click trains, which are made of numerous individual clicks, usually broadband signals, that are emitted in a continuous fashion. They can form a kind of pseudo acoustic language, and dolphins use them as a call or a way to identify their groupmates. ( They can form an actual \"language\", but they can be used separately for identification purposes ). A different way of creating acoustic communication is the \"sending of pings, \" which consists of a very specific and short signal, usually emitted by single vocal organs. Pings can be created by dolphins only when they encounter something important, like food ( like squid, but also fish ). The last type of sound is a call, as in the case of male dolphins, making a single very loud burst of communication at a known location. Most often these are \"spy chasers \" that are used to mark and locate prey.\n\nOther animals communicate in different ways. Birds use different \"chirps \" and \" chitters \" for identification and to call other birds with a known identity. Bees, orchid bees ( which have evolved to be able to emit sounds ) and wasp,s also have a very limited means of communication. It is estimated that some species, such as blue whales, produce as much energy in their calls as we would produce if we spent a week at the pool with 100 000 watts : they emit up to 40 000 watts of sound!\n\nIn this site i also wrote of the use of songs as a type of communication between different species of animals. When we look into a field ( the sea or the sky or simply in a forest ; ) the sound of each and every creature we hear will surely be different. Sometimes even it may differ in pitch, form, pitch-length, duration and frequency from all other sounds in the same place.\n\nIn other articles, different types of sound waves and of sound waves can be explained. But it seems to me that this is just a very small part of the very complex acoustic world. Indeed, even if we do not know the \"language \" of birds, we can still understand most of it. For instance, we know that the female will tell the male in which direction to swim, and we also know the name of the species of birds that make these types of sounds. Of course, the more we discover about the birds sounds, the more complex they become.","token_len":506,"entropy":[7.6182,0.1588,7.7646,4.0452,2.3696,0.0167,9.385,1.1026,3.9961,1.529,9.1576,3.8176,7.999,4.6356,9.1809,2.0281,0.006,2.9215,1.9968,2.5689,1.5323,8.4999,11.0199,0.7293,3.9171,1.3706,3.7279,1.4306,7.1077,5.2177,1.3762,1.2303,5.4873,14.1004,3.4831,1.4031,2.1401,1.3221,4.9629,2.6586,1.7167,3.5103,3.0797,1.4647,3.257,2.5704,6.805,1.8254,3.7801,0.0051,6.6747,5.135,7.3363,1.4659,2.6256,7.3503,2.8609,1.8301,2.338,1.0591,7.6313,3.7434,1.775,4.4472,0.6579,5.9926,2.5933,6.5088,4.2905,0.5201,5.2351,6.2384,1.8454,4.9726,3.4017,4.8918,3.5312,4.4477,3.0293,3.095,2.1868,2.4991,2.7453,3.0958,7.1535,1.9235,5.9986,1.7414,4.1421,3.5546,5.6014,4.5782,0.6132,3.0892,4.0437,4.7962,0.5409,3.324,2.6237,4.6479,5.3845,4.197,7.8759,2.6101,5.2192,5.7357,1.252,4.7253,0.2505,1.4909,5.7639,3.3305,3.5437,4.2051,4.4267,1.6886,2.6868,5.6883,1.5109,6.7946,5.1094,5.2342,1.1534,5.0346,0.114,1.4164,0.5136,4.7974,0.9341,6.2435,4.0917,2.1514,1.2685,6.4845,4.9013,5.6946,1.3361,2.549,3.3246,3.7629,5.3759,5.7894,3.2799,4.7487,2.4991,3.1245,1.8925,2.225,6.4674,1.8403,0.2427,1.9946,1.0936,2.8122,4.7223,1.2771,4.8258,2.666,1.409,3.1997,0.0245,7.1896,1.1936,1.1496,7.4478,1.5041,4.3091,8.3481,3.6873,6.1623,0.5391,5.7193,4.4285,1.3184,7.5802,1.4795,0.7044,4.858,5.0285,2.4013,1.7177,4.123,4.5014,4.7275,5.3265,3.0978,7.2177,3.111,1.7552,2.8929,0.685,5.5006,3.8325,4.1783,3.5963,1.2026,2.5273,0.2678,5.0536,3.5312,5.5606,2.6789,2.0181,0.1269,1.0769,5.849,2.7153,4.1173,4.5624,4.2848,3.5465,0.8162,7.3591,3.0089,0.7117,7.3644,6.5993,0.5273,2.8228,5.4296,2.3181,2.3654,4.8286,3.5499,1.0586,4.9612,2.6569,6.5109,4.9138,0.5078,7.5745,2.7147,5.5799,8.2869,5.2271,3.0238,5.3344,3.2111,4.3243,1.4342,2.2929,3.357,0.0153,4.8088,2.8374,4.6327,2.4774,8.1288,3.2056,4.9151,9.9849,8.7832,2.9375,2.5805,3.8251,3.7753,5.1836,0.3097,1.3812,0.8357,4.5723,0.4242,4.4387,0.0396,3.9456,2.2682,3.2737,0.8508,0.001,5.9595,1.157,0.664,4.8979,5.1034,1.2056,6.0425,3.9231,0.8072,5.3396,0.0781,4.7229,5.6796,5.7516,2.4414,0.3352,5.1138,2.2594,3.7793,3.3521,1.4659,6.7233,2.8412,6.4027,6.2653,9.1959,11.279,3.9091,3.3498,4.8422,0.0027,3.9913,2.7391,2.061,1.4333,3.2285,5.9364,1.513,0.0004,3.203,3.9334,7.1511,6.2809,5.4541,6.7605,5.4143,1.6636,4.0485,0.0498,7.5986,2.8489,1.1063,4.9309,0.0098,0.9999,3.7683,3.2093,1.0499,1.5997,1.6961,0.7383,5.1688,2.6159,4.2136,3.6076,3.9804,6.2688,4.5355,4.6918,3.3245,2.001,1.1706,3.2064,3.4065,8.0956,3.2096,2.6573,5.1245,7.4801,3.8297,2.9943,3.758,1.2653,4.1589,5.6183,0.0817,4.8734,3.5719,2.5923,4.0831,7.1118,1.0146,1.8818,1.2797,5.0826,4.1501,5.1198,3.1553,4.8781,2.0646,5.6977,1.6386,6.0155,0.6692,6.2543,2.5407,5.7439,0.5339,5.1612,1.8863,3.5864,5.3276,5.7797,1.5072,1.0667,2.7441,0.4932,2.3679,2.0093,0.7934,2.0709,0.0004,2.8678,3.5725,5.0467,2.6125,7.9816,1.6564,0.0128,2.0383,7.1106,3.8262,5.5183,3.7293,1.8019,2.9264,0.1775,5.3988,1.3409,4.4418,3.3556,3.5585,2.1342,0.4166,0.1659,3.3061,1.4967,3.8481,1.0406,3.6296,2.8871,1.2473,0.1025,0.3025,6.4919,2.4656,5.5254,3.7256,1.5545,6.219,0.6386,3.8288,2.1639,1.3462,3.4981,0.5693,1.4914,1.6632,5.3103,4.07,6.1927,0.7537,5.3881,0.8572,1.0968,1.1255,1.8535,2.318,5.7582,0.395,1.9026,0.9763,3.2243,1.5269,0.3522,2.525,2.2932,0.6439,1.7676,6.2014,3.7526,4.2602,1.572,0.7038,4.8483,5.1161,2.9677,2.6098,5.31,1.7024,1.4059,2.4291,3.0638,0.0464,3.3935,4.2506,0.1258,0.5494,3.4429,1.89,3.0808,1.4589,4.2673,3.148,6.9315,0.005,0.789,0.3694,5.3828,0.0725,0.5443,2.7173,4.5518,2.0351,5.4046,1.6052,1.05,5.8982,7.8152,0.893,0.0647,0.2878,3.2117,1.7216,0.9859,0.4852]}

The group included the lieutenant governors of North and South Carolina, as well as the secretaries of commerce for both states and the ambassadors to Israel and Senegal.\n\nThe group was \"very proud\" of O'Malley's performance and had no doubt had he carried Maryland the group would have supported him for president.\n\nThe only Maryland elected official to endorse Tufaro was State Sen. Anthony G. O'Donnell, the ranking Democrat on a Montgomery County legislative committee. O'Donnell said that he and many in the district would choose between Tufaro or O'Malley if they were forced to chose.\n\n\" I would give myself to that candidate who would go to Washington and bring Maryland values and Maryland pride to the nation's capitol,\" O'Donnell said.\n\nTufaro said that support means much.\n\n\"I'm very humbled and honored as well as flattered. I appreciate their support,\" he said. \"It shows me the type of support you can bring to bear on a campaign... that when they see how many doors I knocked on, how many doors of people they know and families that we served, that at the end of the day we get into a situation where the decision between the two candidates comes down to which one has the best shot to beat the governor.\"\n\nO'Malley won 50 percent of the first votes cast, while Tufaro got 26 percent. But early voting counts are largely dominated by Republicans, and O'Malley performed well against the late start Democrat in heavily Democratic Maryland.\n\nDemocrats also were pleased to have a contested nomination.\n\n\"We know the value of going into an election as strong as possible,\" said Howard County Executive Ken Ulman, a Democrat who backed O'Malley during the primary. \"The best way to do that is to be in a primary where there are a number of candidates running for an open seat. Having it as a contested primary is a strength at this level, and a strength well worth preserving.\"","token_len":506,"entropy":[2.0585,7.4918,5.2093,5.9185,2.6152,1.2295,6.8627,0.1152,0.3647,6.6768,6.8574,5.0523,6.5816,0.78,5.4105,2.5361,8.0032,9.1705,9.152,2.2636,4.8954,9.0726,8.4208,2.6082,1.2002,3.5681,0.0008,0.6764,2.2029,5.5024,1.0589,12.2332,5.2835,9.6618,0.5059,0.8969,1.2929,4.7288,0.3432,7.9944,0.0288,0.5975,4.0313,0.2012,0.2633,0.7703,2.1006,3.0109,0.8841,4.6222,6.7231,3.5015,0.8044,4.2364,3.634,0.2031,0.0274,3.7926,1.5177,7.5673,0.0136,1.3937,4.935,1.9371,2.6119,2.5688,3.6642,3.4821,2.0558,3.7207,0.0016,0.898,1.0228,0.0005,5.9082,0.0202,0.0013,2.7626,3.4966,0.0225,4.6026,5.1558,7.129,0.4583,0.0783,2.2546,5.2659,3.5036,3.091,0.0031,0.8692,0.5105,0.0007,7.2014,0.4379,1.445,1.3698,2.9528,5.7473,4.3364,3.4375,7.5315,7.3951,0.1485,3.7862,5.7602,0.0792,0.1337,0.3691,2.9678,0.0012,0.0028,2.2382,5.427,0.0819,5.1725,2.9677,3.9166,1.5117,1.4931,1.0231,7.79,2.3505,4.1488,1.8693,7.0053,0.2825,0.7955,0.0002,2.6065,1.8095,3.1183,5.3235,3.8236,4.1404,0.7386,0.4782,1.0048,0.2309,0.0007,0.8299,2.9562,2.4258,4.7213,4.8973,3.4408,6.5766,6.2511,4.1342,5.8879,6.6236,9.4409,0.8724,1.4814,3.979,0.2848,4.0549,0.7277,0.3518,0.8944,0.0002,2.8057,5.3359,6.9325,5.699,0.7319,1.2555,1.49,4.8831,0.0087,0.0025,1.1737,5.1767,1.7203,0.0022,4.4864,3.3024,1.3608,6.0995,0.1551,2.7615,0.6878,2.9969,5.5179,0.385,0.2768,5.4724,7.4024,0.0376,5.5375,0.3342,0.5874,2.0512,0.0152,0.0115,3.1453,2.4771,1.4828,3.7304,4.5169,3.5762,0.6397,6.5969,2.6812,6.8997,4.5923,3.3317,0.0042,0.002,1.5567,1.3085,0.0832,0.1538,2.0319,1.324,1.7251,6.1638,0.0571,6.1967,1.2458,0.278,0.0002,1.2463,10.3071,2.8307,4.5166,5.5409,3.6614,4.5525,3.2735,3.878,2.3102,4.2688,1.8934,2.7375,0.9732,4.7488,4.6969,6.5779,1.3165,4.135,3.6374,0.8138,1.2386,2.3767,2.6307,7.7344,0.0004,0.4509,0.378,0.0029,0.0013,0.2325,0.4957,0.7193,0.0001,2.5923,0.0388,0.0026,2.093,1.7242,6.9649,9.3669,4.8977,4.6049,1.01,0.0001,0.0976,1.0504,2.2817,2.9752,5.7503,0.0017,2.0242,2.0092,6.1711,3.8604,1.4443,9.5708,0.0198,4.2794,0.7647,4.587,4.7921,0.8385,1.353,0.6246,0.0691,0.1197,0.8272,2.7743,4.4161,4.298,3.3292,5.7932,0.0018,3.0265,3.2158,1.3413,3.5298,0.7048,5.1508,1.0042,1.8773,1.2138,7.3249,4.6888,5.7342,4.0434,3.0919,4.2412,3.2011,7.4606,3.6694,7.7061,1.2874,0.7706,4.048,0.1465,2.3679,6.575,2.567,1.9868,4.9804,2.4379,9.0255,2.1733,3.6578,6.6088,0.6246,2.2372,6.9376,1.8952,0.355,0.0545,0.1169,0.0249,1.9247,5.6638,5.8452,1.6372,2.863,0.367,3.1917,5.8399,5.9422,2.4572,0.9713,1.7777,4.6634,0.0354,0.0329,3.2368,0.8747,3.368,0.2914,1.7595,4.0485,1.9285,5.2951,1.3568,5.4159,0.8096,0.2822,0.0002,2.458,0.0522,1.1528,3.8315,6.0301,0.4374,0.0845,0.1482,5.7402,6.1693,0.6807,2.1735,2.7244,0.7842,0.0048,0.002,3.9344,4.4974,0.1154,0.6127,4.7214,7.5201,1.1975,6.7314,4.2126,6.6393,6.062,0.0141,3.3662,0.9977,2.2145,2.5584,0.0049,0.491,6.6869,1.9537,3.6042,2.1628,7.0699,7.968,6.4091,2.8898,6.9118,0.6277,2.6628,0.5572,0.4383,0.0002,5.0847,3.4023,3.5906,4.6147,2.5554,2.9639,2.6303,6.8733,4.8812,1.7781,1.1867,0.0001,0.9923,2.3015,4.014,2.6817,6.5104,0.1699,5.9532,3.7849,3.4405,0.2225,4.4422,5.2011,0.2571,4.9092,1.4685,0.4485,5.8542,5.3426,2.5094,4.8087,8.772,2.2431,0.7735,2.014,0.8872,1.0625,4.6577,1.2244,0.0072,0.0114,3.7411,0.4397,1.6736,0.6327,0.4141,3.0779,5.0678,1.1284,0.2412,1.1867,0.2861,0.1811,0.4142,3.2671,3.4679,1.4436,3.5475,3.8769,2.7408,1.2001,2.5515,3.287,0.0099,1.6798,3.4856,1.739,6.0785,1.3,0.3868,1.5795,6.1508,6.0805,4.4171,0.6159,3.857,1.3984,1.0382,1.4965,6.9457,6.0779,0.8161,3.027,2.69,0.9662,4.2184,4.9625,7.2729,3.3302,5.9527,0.5116]}

{"id":4747,"ended":false,"length":463,"text":"The final race in Europe took place at Monza. Ferrari's early bid to put Fernando Alonso on pole position by way of using Felipe Massa to offer him a slipstream ended in disaster, when Massa failed to lap fast enough. Lewis Hamilton, who was already on pole, led a Mercedes one-two while Sebastian Vettel, Valtteri Bottas and Daniel Ricciardo filled the next four places. Vettel, Valtteri Bottas and Daniel Ricciardo had qualified for the race second, third and fourth respectively, while Lewis Hamilton clinched the pole with a time of 1.20.924. That means that the only way two Mercedes cars will start on the front row together is if both team-mates had the opposite colours painted on their cars. The teams have never been allowed to run cars of one different colour on the front row unless there was something of an unbalance between the cars.\n\nF1 2018: Monza Qualifying Results | Fastest Times\n\nDespite that, both team principal Toto Wolff and Vettel said that it would be an advantage to Mercedes if the red and blue lines were painted on their cars. \"The reason why I think it would be a big advantage if the blue paint was on the front wing is because you are trying to get the biggest tow possible and as long as there's a blue flag, it will keep going and it will take you out of the pits,\" Vettel told Sky F1 television after qualifying. \"There will be a lot of people pulling out for the first few corners, and maybe that will give you the advantage to get that tow or the advantage into a corner. Obviously, having the right paint scheme helps,\" Wolff added.\n\n\"It's obvious we want both cars to be on front rows, but first and foremost, it's about the drivers.

{"id":3806,"ended":false,"length":469,"text":"In September 2006, Lethem wrote the article, `` The Genius of Bob Dylan ``, a lengthy interview with Bob Dylan, which was published in Rolling Stone. The interview contained Lethem' s first on-the-record statements about his experiences as a guest artist in the world premiere of Dylan' s musical, Blonde on Blonde. It also marked the first time in their fifty-year relationship that Dylan and Lethem had ever discussed the circumstances of Dylan' s songwriting. In Lethem' s second article, `` An Argument About Poetry ` `` published in Rolling Stone in March 2009 and written along with Dylan' s first published interview in Rolling Stone in more than twenty-five years, Lethem describes his attempt to understand what had led Dylan to reject his earlier work as a work of genius to turn it into what he now describes as ordinary and predictable. The article was widely recognized as offering a provocative and much-needed perspective on Dylan' s art and creativity.\n\nThe article that is in issue #18 is a review of a book titled \"The Secret Life of Robert Johnson \" written by John Fante with a foreword by Lethem. The first publication of the review was in \"Lethem & Other Writings No. 16 : February 2008.\n\nOn April 9, 2008, the Rolling Stone blog published Lethem' s essay titled \" 'Barry's Back' - New Book by Philip Roth\" in which he reviews Philip Roth' s latest book, \"Before Jerusalem: The Complete Plays of Philip Roth\".\n\nIn December of 2008, Lethem' s review of Steve Moore' s book \" The Devil & Tom Walker\" was published by the literary magazine The Believer. In the review he writes: \"Moore's The Devil & Tom Walker is more than a biography of American musician Tom Walker. It feels like a confession to a secret life. These pages are written as letters to others - about the author and his life and the music. Weaving these autobiographical passages into the biography, it becomes a story about how music has kept Moore alive - that is, about how something so often intangible can become embodied and tangible in the music. In many ways it's a coming-of-age tale, as Moore's character is forced to face up to the truth about his father and brother and his homosexuality, things he either wanted to ignore or deny. It's a book about how music can help heal and, yes, even a journey to the heart of hell.\"","token_len":508,"entropy":[7.9887,4.7344,0.1938,10.5617,5.2801,3.7911,3.2735,5.0431,2.4151,7.9997,6.9739,9.254,0.4216,7.6735,1.0713,4.7226,3.0355,2.8159,5.756,4.9711,0.7148,3.3293,0.0699,1.9547,2.3915,1.5558,1.0678,0.4703,2.2467,0.0027,1.3353,2.1679,2.4978,5.2319,9.711,0.0006,7.4856,2.7943,2.935,6.4775,0.1704,1.3145,0.0021,0.1744,4.3397,1.5498,1.5311,4.1112,1.7907,0.2975,7.4328,4.6378,2.6524,1.018,6.5701,6.4947,0.2321,4.4491,7.3051,0.0494,5.2306,3.1702,8.1657,0.5731,2.6409,3.4351,0.0388,0.898,3.3756,2.0099,6.8054,0.431,1.1598,0.1939,2.0583,6.8077,7.0317,0.2775,0.6348,1.8635,0.1603,2.9367,2.8864,0.0386,0.0007,0.6001,2.3961,3.0448,1.7953,6.7579,1.5127,2.6832,0.9331,0.0104,6.668,1.5598,1.1951,1.9634,5.8355,0.001,0.6905,0.0026,4.6457,3.0247,0.5702,1.9023,6.1953,7.3556,4.5379,6.1343,0.2646,6.2701,5.025,6.0225,0.2887,0.8952,0.0088,2.7495,3.4608,2.7821,4.7304,4.7965,7.2977,0.8133,1.6973,2.3718,0.0053,2.9302,4.8485,4.1316,2.1986,1.4506,0.0252,1.4631,10.5105,1.2392,2.2918,1.2143,0.897,0.1644,0.4226,0.5651,0.0006,5.793,1.385,6.9562,0.1835,5.1937,3.7274,5.1085,3.3154,1.5405,0.3079,6.745,1.4474,4.5832,2.722,1.8771,1.1402,4.5777,0.1729,5.1826,5.9836,6.588,2.384,0.2629,5.1229,0.4568,3.1442,2.5091,0.0613,9.798,5.1709,6.9703,2.4762,2.7597,2.1506,2.7606,4.3072,5.8064,0.6517,8.0683,1.1708,5.4664,1.375,7.0968,0.2002,0.5274,2.7543,0.3265,0.9685,0.9967,0.0052,4.0221,1.6175,5.3241,0.7742,3.4272,0.0469,2.4845,2.3641,6.0663,4.3941,4.6722,3.6795,4.146,4.7718,2.753,2.0764,4.4407,0.2125,3.0384,2.1402,3.771,3.0782,1.9902,5.2532,1.7689,0.0836,4.3956,5.2052,5.3759,3.1833,0.2145,3.1615,9.1748,4.3626,6.2562,3.0147,5.3287,0.0152,0.1087,3.7956,0.0011,0.783,1.305,4.5747,6.4923,0.7135,0.8225,3.3989,0.8595,1.1103,5.1628,6.4376,0.0093,4.6538,5.7143,3.4032,0.0648,7.5185,0.3756,4.1813,6.2082,8.6284,3.1879,2.4235,2.0156,0.0003,4.2608,2.7518,3.2168,0.1005,1.2341,0.2551,2.5662,4.0853,0.0833,5.9393,2.3582,4.4734,0.0013,1.4635,0.0063,4.274,3.2697,1.8036,5.3172,5.0886,4.1351,1.9919,6.6805,2.6258,4.1014,6.0203,4.2601,4.7154,7.7125,3.8686,3.8341,2.1456,0.9241,0.5821,5.3263,6.3418,0.0142,4.5361,5.2146,4.3633,0.8375,0.6755,1.6985,7.9377,10.8402,1.4605,1.6246,5.3307,7.9604,0.812,3.9788,0.0214,4.2412,2.4011,0.0003,1.8331,4.5328,3.2747,0.7429,0.1553,1.3069,0.0012,2.2377,0.0076,3.8093,0.7243,9.3265,6.7827,4.9543,0.4833,2.548,1.1902,2.8609,5.7038,6.3229,6.9275,8.0801,3.7016,0.8755,0.3911,2.1815,2.535,5.556,1.23,3.0863,8.0321,0.417,0.5972,1.9423,1.9738,1.0747,3.9804,2.3182,1.4574,1.4368,3.9254,1.0654,4.2752,0.2706,0.4803,0.0516,0.014,1.0193,5.1298,1.6933,0.8351,4.7979,0.8327,6.861,5.431,1.4281,0.0179,1.5776,0.6373,8.463,0.638,0.7204,7.5513,1.5315,3.1076,4.2081,2.3302,1.911,6.5424,4.249,1.7611,4.1389,2.7869,7.5423,0.9139,6.4641,4.9247,4.2536,1.9541,5.0542,1.8677,0.7067,1.6333,2.1428,2.0702,3.8662,2.8632,4.773,10.3895,3.1319,6.24,0.1607,3.6521,2.1451,1.4422,4.967,1.702,2.5235,3.5028,1.822,3.9323,1.4606,3.2901,7.2487,2.1884,6.0959,6.503,1.7136,4.322,4.3763,2.7069,0.3888,1.8527,1.9766,6.7611,2.1594,5.2804,7.9615,2.676,2.9992,7.1156,2.6857,6.7975,2.4548,1.4255,3.867,1.9494,3.2317,4.6878,0.2061,2.7643,2.0921,1.0409,7.7435,0.6796,0.084,0.005,0.0009,2.7727,2.052,3.57,1.7064,1.716,5.8532,2.4789,4.7456,0.2499,3.5924,4.2534,0.0159,1.2129,4.1389,1.5243,0.6497,4.2718,1.7342,5.2058,1.8986,2.0994,6.2007,2.278,8.7908,1.593,8.5597,5.9346,1.3068,2.8645,0.1012,5.0911,0.8365,2.1381,0.5815,0.8818,3.5744,1.4432,3.1746,1.8026,2.45,3.038,6.3472,2.3454,5.1504,4.9389,0.0267,2.8794,6.6732,6.1217,1.9122,2.0477,4.1487,0.5177,7.3104,1.3433]}

{"id":373,"ended":true,"length":446,"text":"The second phase of building work undertaken by the Hospitallers began in the early 13th century and lasted decades. The outer walls were built in the last major construction on the site, lending the Hospitallers a new character. Although work stopped during the 14th century, the original chapel of the monastery, which is a small Romanesque-style building, still stands today as well as the chapel of Saint Eustace.\n\nBy the time the Hospitallers began to lose their power, the walls of the castle were very weak. During the 16th and 17th centuries, and especially due to the frequent fires that destroyed most houses in the city, the castle was converted into an inn. At the height of its prosperity, the Hospitallers used the castle as guest accommodation as well as for banquets. The Hospitallers left a mark on the site with the construction of the entrance portal in the east wall, which is in the shape of a lion and is rich in decorations. The castle remained an inn right up until the 19th century.\n\nAfter the city was burnt down by Russian troops in 1648, it had to be rebuilt. In contrast to the original castle, which was destroyed in the 1640s, the present-day town houses were constructed in the Renaissance style.\n\nThe castle was rebuilt under the ownership of the family de La Vali\u00e8re at the beginning of the 18th century. The fa\u00e7ade of the house consists mostly of small windows and doors, which gives the castle an almost medieval look. The castle served as a hotel for the De La Vali\u00e8re-Blanche family and the Mairie between the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nFollowing the city's takeover by the municipality in 1885, the castle became part of the Mus\u00e9e de Cluny. The castle's entrance was subsequently closed to tourists as the surrounding areas gradually fell into neglect. In the meantime, the castle was partly neglected due to mismanagement and corruption. The castle still stands in a poor state of repair and the castle site is in a state of decay and decay. The castle no longer has any historical or tourist value, as the entire castle is in a serious state of decay.\n\nAn underground car park which would be constructed in front of the castle to store cars has been built over part of the medieval wall. However, work on the car park has yet to begin because of the current condition of the castle.","token_len":508,"entropy":[6.7499,5.2319,0.4616,6.9806,7.7875,8.8735,1.0267,0.7301,12.0482,4.0545,0.1309,1.315,6.5961,1.1388,2.4872,1.7975,8.7415,0.5516,0.0569,1.9317,3.3898,9.9358,0.3797,1.6705,9.2115,0.9234,1.1697,3.0777,1.8238,1.6351,5.8171,6.793,3.9923,4.1122,0.6782,0.6747,1.5252,11.7436,1.9721,5.3337,0.0265,0.0195,0.0669,1.3922,2.8984,4.2471,0.6319,5.4329,6.8215,7.288,3.4436,0.1836,3.542,0.0158,0.146,0.2156,0.8375,4.3294,6.1093,3.7467,0.7247,5.3495,3.4577,1.8557,2.8878,4.2064,4.6549,10.0591,0.5916,0.0035,4.3922,0.3036,1.9576,0.7004,1.8332,0.9769,1.9097,3.1449,4.7595,0.3995,1.777,3.1692,0.9465,4.157,5.0208,0.9309,0.4195,1.6431,1.0301,0.0236,5.1695,0.7464,2.6444,0.8577,1.8054,0.007,0.0089,0.0108,3.2805,2.2834,6.9739,0.9351,4.2365,1.1275,1.2551,3.8127,1.527,0.3222,6.5096,1.0173,5.584,5.1604,0.8613,4.3705,0.3851,3.3165,0.0653,1.9002,0.0383,0.0038,0.058,0.4026,5.929,1.6546,8.6097,0.0048,0.5913,7.552,4.4356,1.8896,3.1041,4.2034,5.0959,1.6375,0.4062,2.3177,0.3804,0.6292,2.5175,1.1439,4.8279,0.3128,2.233,4.5787,1.1736,4.4703,0.7258,3.7937,0.0077,2.0817,5.014,0.3385,0.6732,2.9662,0.0028,0.0023,0.0063,3.9002,1.5108,3.3537,1.0849,7.9161,3.7314,4.4769,0.2703,0.0491,3.4563,10.7796,0.0049,0.176,1.4317,1.7023,3.7757,0.0027,0.0033,0.0075,6.0314,3.3871,4.9576,0.3255,0.2549,5.39,3.1014,1.3847,3.4447,0.0327,0.8437,6.5416,7.3961,3.3145,1.0678,6.8832,1.5889,1.5743,1.0226,2.5323,4.6725,1.4602,2.4774,0.0044,0.3121,4.2052,2.7887,2.4633,10.3756,0.797,6.1057,0.6217,1.3784,3.7339,4.8804,3.5534,3.984,11.2079,0.9908,0.6376,0.3812,2.3676,0.0026,0.0237,0.9781,0.7521,0.0002,4.1119,0.4963,5.6994,1.0074,6.2527,0.8284,2.118,8.5295,2.6543,0.5649,2.352,3.4663,0.0978,3.3637,4.1637,1.2464,0.223,0.8666,1.3789,2.4075,6.5363,0.3444,0.4985,3.4971,2.6474,0.3625,1.9842,0.8648,3.4041,1.2645,1.0847,3.3417,3.0651,0.0575,0.4385,0.3527,7.0938,2.2336,0.0005,3.9765,5.2229,1.5146,2.9685,1.3288,1.0427,6.5949,0.5612,0.6913,2.4607,0.0002,1.3205,3.8107,1.3582,2.9531,4.3085,0.4433,3.7474,0.0187,0.7752,5.2271,8.8624,5.4164,6.2223,7.0867,0.4724,4.5857,1.018,3.4744,0.0092,0.1667,2.3812,0.0033,0.0164,0.5078,1.1042,5.8377,0.0032,0.0397,0.9061,0.0976,3.35,4.3103,5.1017,0.0177,4.8945,2.819,1.597,4.0359,1.3248,2.1086,6.9403,1.0038,2.6275,2.026,3.0957,1.3754,1.3166,0.1681,0.9399,3.2531,5.114,0.2466,0.5688,4.127,1.6315,0.9032,7.1364,1.7851,0.6342,0.1003,0.0072,7.763,8.2859,1.2309,0.8496,2.0022,2.3082,7.1962,5.1041,4.3679,11.1807,1.8806,3.9914,0.0111,0.1128,1.0806,0.0036,0.0679,0.2944,0.9885,0.0002,5.6982,0.2456,5.3053,0.1513,6.4099,1.3288,0.4955,9.0812,1.3252,1.391,4.4339,0.0666,0.3759,1.9255,2.3429,2.7946,0.0013,0.4766,8.2922,0.1872,0.8823,6.1119,3.4638,0.255,2.052,1.2162,2.1066,2.8472,4.3124,1.4786,6.8864,3.6152,1.8555,3.4142,4.0489,2.0019,5.5494,3.3107,7.4461,4.4341,0.9178,5.2121,0.3122,2.5535,1.6127,4.53,0.0975,0.575,2.1377,1.0058,7.5917,7.2292,3.8546,0.0057,7.9223,0.1584,1.5177,4.5265,0.5406,1.7109,1.9554,4.3901,2.3582,2.8488,2.2423,5.2683,1.3181,3.0613,2.473,1.6464,3.2341,3.0,8.0567,1.0087,3.4513,1.919,0.8061,0.004,2.0862,3.7429,2.4576,1.0584,1.8147,1.9739,7.5322,0.0088,1.3791,2.2348,3.7309,4.1112,6.8507,1.7249,2.0645,2.6677,1.6041,5.8884,2.9152,1.4781,2.5597,2.2322,7.5371,1.1045,0.0147,0.7303,0.4708,0.7195,0.0002,5.7677,5.611,5.624,0.5779,4.9377,5.3681,1.8972,4.3242,1.6532,4.855,0.0102,0.0472,0.571,3.7389,3.5173,6.9106,3.3061,0.716,1.7253,4.7962,6.5794,0.0022,0.0585,5.8631,5.2619,0.8021,4.7398,0.0497,6.9274,1.622,0.5092,2.8482,0.0549,1.2133,2.844,0.0049,1.0816,5.2794,0.6344,0.8051,4.9597,3.6643,0.1799,0.0831,1.1877,0.3803]}

The song was number 1 on the UK Singles Chart, the biggest hit by any artist on the chart throughout that whole summer season, outselling the Beatles and their former bandmate George Harrison (who was featured in a Top 10 hit the week prior ). The video for the song was nominated for Best Video at the 2007 MTV UK Video Music Awards. At the awards, held on September and hosted by comedian Jo Brand and MTV's Stephen Hill, Brown won the award for Best New Act. The track was also nominated for Best Pop Video at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards. The video also received two nominations for the 2007 Billboard Music Video Award for Video of the Year and Best Direction of Video. The \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" video has been cited as an influence on the series of horror films in the 1990s where the \"Walking Dead\" zombies shuffle. Director David Cronenberg has commented that he wanted to make a horror movie where people danced and were happy, but he did not know what to call his movie. In the video, Brown wears a white suit; however, this is only the skin of his suit and as the viewer sees the man's underwear, it is revealed that the suit is actually made out of gold. During the performance Brown is being pursued by a swarm of ravenous killer bees. During Brown's performance of \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" on the Graham Norton Show on 21 March 2008, the video was voted the fourth most memorable video by the public.[11] In the beginning of the clip, Michael Jackson, appearing in a ghost-like apparition, sings \"I wanna give this song to you\". The first lyric that Brown sings from Jackson's part in the song is \"I wanna hold you\", after which the ghosts start dancing with Brown.\n\nAccording to MTV, it was a video that \"had people talking, and dancing, and humming.\"[12] It has been noted for showing \"brash Britney as one of pop's true characters\".[4][13] Entertainment Weekly magazine noted, \"Her '90s look, while in line with her current aesthetic, makes [Brown] look like an extra from an '80s rock flick.\" The video has reached 658 million views on YouTube by October 2013.[14]","token_len":508,"entropy":[7.7812,5.8606,7.6415,5.2933,12.9808,5.6918,6.5622,2.1371,8.0527,14.1163,2.0705,11.8104,16.1119,2.2322,0.1234,1.8822,4.8471,1.0224,8.582,0.0137,3.6278,4.7128,6.4308,11.7209,7.9979,3.9545,2.1414,4.6506,7.7319,0.6793,2.0902,8.2128,2.206,1.2067,0.7198,7.1464,7.3491,9.8622,4.3212,5.5261,2.0977,7.3279,3.3008,1.946,4.2164,3.2588,2.4279,6.4472,1.6824,8.5867,3.2004,0.4008,0.9146,5.7024,4.7115,0.1083,1.0341,1.8461,3.3948,4.7761,2.1491,3.8715,3.4188,3.7439,1.9067,0.8912,1.3009,7.849,4.7031,6.6819,3.8139,5.6758,1.7992,7.0413,0.2244,1.8012,3.0037,2.3892,4.1658,7.7407,2.9088,0.7425,4.5556,0.219,3.8978,1.4034,2.1294,5.0857,1.0018,2.5543,6.6999,0.9591,1.9423,5.2729,4.5619,3.624,5.6712,1.8259,2.5916,4.5738,1.0583,0.8207,1.1729,4.6732,0.1732,3.4192,1.9667,2.4372,0.2914,4.9956,0.8362,8.4693,1.0374,0.4199,0.037,1.1015,5.8533,0.3449,5.0431,1.8044,9.1156,2.1612,2.8845,8.9419,15.3177,0.0186,5.9286,6.8529,8.5738,3.7196,5.2892,1.3422,6.013,6.7253,0.4644,1.3761,3.6436,1.2685,2.0487,0.3438,0.6606,2.9407,7.9762,1.4638,1.928,4.8935,1.0809,2.4281,0.9112,0.0873,1.4406,4.3188,2.9473,1.5554,0.2236,2.3098,0.3314,0.6655,0.0235,0.0198,0.6635,1.9957,1.6012,3.8058,2.3346,3.8521,2.4214,0.5222,3.0342,4.8471,4.2512,1.437,2.0474,2.5605,1.9016,5.8378,0.7827,0.0053,0.0104,2.5002,1.4444,5.185,3.8874,7.6878,1.3632,1.5974,6.0563,7.5759,4.5138,0.0475,0.1598,0.2988,0.0634,0.199,0.6329,3.9759,1.0298,6.0672,0.7468,2.9115,4.1227,0.7148,1.3581,6.3857,2.1731,8.3612,0.8939,4.1235,1.4824,3.6478,0.1341,5.9834,1.4296,5.0803,5.39,1.2644,0.0311,0.2345,4.6512,11.1796,6.1806,8.1742,3.0487,2.471,0.0001,2.8254,4.3043,0.9372,2.5296,3.8989,0.6798,1.8961,1.038,2.1133,1.1551,3.7913,3.9755,9.7619,2.1992,3.7081,5.3037,2.0693,1.4763,2.2806,3.8907,0.1084,3.5385,1.8385,1.3796,4.467,3.8939,2.7939,0.6305,3.2144,1.9558,2.2904,0.5784,3.1229,6.3571,0.6117,3.2631,3.4821,6.1902,6.0924,0.1183,3.8742,1.0137,3.7248,2.1932,7.8888,1.2063,0.9728,3.7978,2.5521,5.4752,2.41,5.5121,3.1443,2.0299,4.1317,1.6192,6.3245,1.2286,1.5425,0.7792,4.0294,0.2719,1.9001,1.5034,0.771,2.3644,3.471,2.2462,0.0099,5.5365,0.8753,5.8982,0.5096,4.7992,2.8152,2.3503,6.4982,4.9799,0.0563,1.2767,6.7627,0.0168,5.7633,0.3431,6.7327,0.7999,1.2671,4.6115,4.5224,0.1135,2.5133,4.6241,1.2245,1.1974,0.0379,0.0022,0.0062,0.0527,0.0025,1.3599,4.2361,1.3427,10.5528,0.6288,0.4921,2.5527,6.6517,3.0761,2.8094,0.2737,1.619,3.8589,0.7659,5.6724,1.5641,6.4686,1.6017,5.4358,1.044,3.7347,1.9009,4.4566,5.5824,3.8994,0.1064,2.4447,1.853,6.1168,0.2546,0.3496,1.9424,0.4369,5.9152,2.4192,3.1045,5.6191,1.7138,1.4038,8.336,2.3793,0.4477,5.9903,0.0019,0.8024,4.738,2.0281,2.6459,3.9382,4.0448,4.8921,3.9447,0.647,0.3263,4.9963,1.5888,5.0189,6.5315,4.8663,4.3687,1.2471,4.6804,7.1612,0.1114,7.9032,2.0929,0.4962,0.8837,0.5513,1.0893,1.7612,0.8829,6.8916,0.8259,6.0557,4.6904,0.5113,1.7181,8.0026,4.2185,3.1323,3.7487,1.6045,1.3576,3.2927,0.0041,5.1172,0.0048,5.0635,0.9321,4.2635,0.6933,2.8314,4.9464,1.6205,4.1382,4.0524,5.9737,3.5826,2.946,2.0884,6.6607,1.2563,0.4501,7.2133,5.7447,0.1856,0.0347,3.2336,2.7695,0.8199,3.113,6.3481,8.3099,3.4549,6.694,4.1672,9.5577,0.3734,6.7209,5.5155,0.1564,5.7964,0.3334,5.6418,4.8743,2.2775,7.7053,2.7162,0.2774,0.1006,9.4299,0.2305,4.2387,3.3543,3.4537,0.4308,6.7703,5.2647,6.5763,0.0055,4.0894,2.8272,4.8802,5.5712,4.5794,0.2499,1.5432,5.97,5.2454,0.3111,4.3904,6.4524,0.3149,0.4421,0.9664,0.9599,2.4246,7.2961,6.3975,3.6233,5.0041,0.1454,0.0086,4.309,6.1686,1.7729,2.1694,3.1132,2.4603,7.12,5.958,6.4576,1.4683,0.1114,1.0963,0.1412,6.0815,3.9435,4.1189,0.95,0.338,0.1103]}

After winning his first MVP award, he was approached to serve as spokesperson for numerous products, including MDG Computers' line of portable CD players. The company offered Nash a selection of three audio models, all the exact same model, all of which he purchased. \"There are so many companies that give out their product free to MVPs,\" Nash notes. \"In my case, the company asked not if they could sell me their product, but if I would be willing to pay for their product. I'm like, if I can help you promote, why would I not do that? It's a win-win situation.\"\n\nIn addition to helping the company promote its products, Nash and his family have made a commitment to MDG as sponsors of its youth baseball league - MDG Fastpitch. As the face of the company's product line, Nash's face also graces the company's promotional materials, which include posters and mailers that are distributed to league directors and parents all over the country. MDG's \"Kids Come First\" theme is something that Nash can certainly relate to. MDG's philosophy, \"When it comes to our company and our products, our kids come first...\"\n\nNash is a role model for numerous children in many different ways. During his free time, he visits schools around the nation where he speaks to the students about sports and academics. Nash tells of one such encounter when he was invited to a school last semester. When he arrived at the school, he immediately noticed the number of children on the waiting list for the school's only elementary program. \"I said to [one of the teachers], 'How many of these kids would have loved to be where I was at their age?'\" Nash recalls. \"He said, 'About half the school right now is on the waiting list.' He put about 20 kids on the list that day - that was just at my school! \" And it goes on and on.\n\nWhile Nash has received numerous awards during his career, he is even more delighted by the people that support him. \"I don't think it's just one award or one thing that makes me what I am,\" he notes. \"It would be the same way if I didn't win any things or if I was just an average guy. It's the people that support me. I can't thank those people enough... for everything [they've] done for me.\"","token_len":509,"entropy":[7.9434,5.6588,11.7723,1.873,2.6008,8.5138,1.5033,5.1519,8.4984,3.2234,4.2442,6.3806,2.0444,1.1141,5.8635,4.5105,2.9293,1.6265,9.7028,0.6721,1.4901,0.9386,2.8071,5.6671,3.1513,3.6812,0.4062,6.836,0.1601,8.3301,5.6414,1.6493,0.6579,10.2556,4.4527,9.707,0.0255,5.8282,6.3663,0.0943,5.2626,6.9067,0.712,0.8086,3.2924,1.0427,5.1172,5.1986,0.7326,8.133,0.0435,5.8654,6.4388,5.1509,1.1628,3.8791,5.5987,8.1322,0.337,3.107,1.4911,5.228,3.1081,0.2571,1.9826,3.2947,2.191,3.5036,4.131,1.948,2.7882,0.0173,4.1515,1.056,4.9672,2.9783,2.6914,3.4956,8.2548,2.8433,12.3026,1.2432,1.1868,1.002,5.3094,0.2323,0.4468,4.5845,2.2722,2.5816,0.2851,2.7434,2.6141,5.1664,7.6917,7.3987,2.6434,1.5056,2.7363,1.7367,2.5986,1.366,0.7829,0.4338,1.0747,0.8148,1.9965,2.5129,1.1991,0.0443,2.6551,1.5403,2.7827,1.8552,1.1554,1.4066,3.0164,4.7331,0.4887,5.3141,0.8539,2.0198,4.5399,3.8954,7.4299,3.8704,3.1735,2.7332,0.253,2.0324,2.4851,0.9541,1.7159,2.4072,0.4931,2.2186,5.2409,0.2918,0.0011,1.0883,0.7846,0.7075,0.0004,3.3804,2.5571,0.1807,5.3099,3.2741,0.8644,3.2587,1.2527,0.6105,0.3212,0.1523,3.9344,0.9696,3.8644,1.5572,4.0091,1.7996,4.7774,0.0641,9.8935,0.05,5.1326,8.3569,1.0933,2.4939,7.3316,5.2538,2.8291,7.1169,3.5759,0.3281,9.5205,8.3956,1.2093,1.287,4.2059,2.6062,7.6315,0.0383,0.8167,2.2696,1.5571,3.2656,1.2538,0.117,0.5511,2.7241,7.0113,4.643,7.674,0.1037,0.7149,1.8196,0.0788,3.7683,0.7241,1.7844,1.6869,1.3002,5.1208,1.8713,9.009,0.7602,2.6345,3.7123,4.4092,1.6222,6.079,5.7659,1.2353,6.6751,4.6129,0.2401,0.1484,0.2663,0.1836,3.9114,0.0016,2.5971,4.5956,4.6594,7.4399,1.9118,0.1338,5.8378,1.6366,6.5011,1.391,3.0261,5.0813,5.9981,1.052,0.0205,0.7678,5.4599,0.0029,2.0849,8.3989,3.1161,4.1458,4.6549,3.0957,0.1005,0.0474,3.8637,4.6302,2.3933,0.8755,2.8569,0.2371,3.7469,3.5989,0.7113,0.0036,8.3884,2.1164,0.0003,2.2463,0.0066,2.3331,2.2711,7.4941,0.0283,0.8095,7.8261,3.6841,2.1298,5.5831,1.6287,1.2527,0.3866,5.2744,0.6384,6.5272,0.1786,0.4742,1.0169,4.7613,3.1429,3.6682,0.079,3.1373,3.838,0.8445,4.5855,1.3601,2.7093,2.9796,1.7142,3.7997,1.0426,6.8446,0.5816,2.6393,6.2016,4.0593,3.0184,2.8972,4.147,2.7735,0.4645,0.6285,6.1018,0.1765,2.0319,3.2437,7.3751,5.3384,1.4666,3.1346,0.9355,2.2773,1.6036,0.3623,0.293,0.374,0.8314,4.8879,2.0646,2.2301,5.4512,0.5106,2.6883,2.4231,0.3339,4.784,0.0823,2.0953,1.5076,2.5785,0.8935,6.9352,6.2938,4.3362,0.8721,1.6011,1.1915,2.9435,2.5179,3.904,4.999,0.7088,0.1483,3.0572,0.7052,0.1063,3.6821,0.8331,2.9595,1.3676,0.2716,4.2514,3.6323,5.0538,0.4444,1.9037,7.4411,1.7118,1.795,3.6973,7.6506,1.0496,1.2075,0.2899,0.6843,0.1014,0.2657,1.8976,0.7651,0.1912,0.0152,7.039,3.7328,3.3474,4.6581,9.3527,0.3621,0.8402,3.5593,1.2169,1.8094,0.0086,1.5643,1.9954,5.1815,7.4618,2.6239,0.9387,1.1198,0.5392,1.966,4.1746,1.3699,6.0047,3.7573,1.8034,3.8076,6.5326,3.5202,1.5305,5.122,3.6627,5.9257,3.8627,5.8657,0.4997,1.1226,0.0067,0.3789,1.116,0.0002,3.8915,1.2675,2.0804,3.9918,2.1923,0.7215,5.1892,0.0532,0.986,0.2468,1.2826,1.8846,6.3815,0.7365,10.2259,2.7137,0.8553,5.1811,2.3636,3.7686,0.7189,0.5165,1.0359,1.1607,3.1691,0.0007,1.2487,2.293,0.2498,3.4286,3.2038,5.6634,2.7807,1.3373,3.2802,3.4446,3.277,0.7467,7.6437,0.0605,0.015,0.9443,0.4772,3.7461,0.0786,0.0926,1.4992,6.0623,0.3441,3.4322,3.3857,5.0128,1.3707,0.8887,2.7123,0.0006,4.5229,4.3127,5.7882,4.2202,2.5871,0.4307,2.7739,2.1161,3.7794,3.0505,2.6928,1.0043,2.0597,0.5908,3.0185,3.0461,0.6751,2.2431,0.1243,1.9096,1.3904,3.4593,0.4534,3.1465,5.4086,0.3468,0.03,5.7709,5.8643,4.0535,6.9835,1.8754,1.5961,1.8709,0.2455,0.2783,0.1269,1.0624]}

However, a YRF source, quoted, \"It would make sense for Ra.One to be a \u20b920-30 crores film due to its budget.\" Another estimate claimed that the budget had been placed somewhere between \u20b9 28 \u2013 30 crore (approximately US $ 7 \u2013 9 million).\n\nA spokesperson for YRF, when contacted, claimed, \"We don't comment on specifics regarding the budget of our films. \"\n\nRa.One is directed by Kabir Singh (PYAR ). The source claimed that the film would have around 120-130 songs.\n\nHe added, \"This number of songs has been agreed upon by SRK and Shahid Kapoor themselves and this is indeed the biggest number for a Bollywood film in recent times\".\n\nAsked where this information was acquired, the source said, \"I've come across it in an industry magazine. It is something that I believe is accurate \".\n\nOne of the major themes being developed in Ra.One is of the link between consumer electronic goods and terrorism, which is also being reflected in the music which is being created. According to the source, \"It is a complex web of connections between the two. The film is a clear reflection of the current state of the world in many ways. People who consume such items also find it hard to understand their impact.\" The source added that the makers had chosen to create what sounds like a \"heavy electronic dance record \" for Ra.One.\n\nSinger Farah Khan is one of the music composers in this film along with Ehsaan Noorani. A number of people have been approached for singing duties in the movie. \"However, they have all backed out at the eleventh hour\". The source said that the two main characters of Ra.One would be seen singing and dancing as a part of an item number. One of the songs has already been completed. Some of the other songs are expected to be finished by the first week of February.","token_len":509,"entropy":[8.5237,4.0361,9.984,6.1944,12.3908,3.3804,4.3296,5.6665,0.0165,6.7153,3.7076,5.5849,0.0027,2.9169,1.7352,1.0679,3.6638,3.0698,0.016,6.8766,4.669,0.6613,1.4371,4.0406,8.8315,0.0661,0.1032,5.3307,12.4267,5.7263,7.8731,6.5465,4.4805,3.1123,9.1413,2.3059,7.2702,2.3831,1.9874,0.1779,0.0554,0.0009,0.0055,5.4688,5.376,4.061,4.8506,3.8071,1.7011,0.3639,1.0442,3.2789,4.732,0.0042,7.7575,5.0808,2.6854,2.3518,5.0438,1.3786,1.3641,7.6752,3.6585,5.0398,1.7708,6.3946,3.1754,2.9925,1.2476,0.0023,0.0174,4.859,1.192,2.5008,0.2508,1.0131,1.4943,0.0053,2.8798,5.2717,0.017,1.2679,4.5064,2.6007,0.0799,6.0835,0.7584,1.6866,3.637,2.0358,3.447,4.0599,0.2059,3.402,2.6096,8.3444,2.9761,6.3676,6.7634,1.5039,2.369,0.0606,2.6521,6.833,13.3012,3.5853,3.2733,4.3111,6.5787,1.7865,3.312,3.4587,4.3438,0.2468,1.2784,3.5557,0.1015,0.0393,0.1462,1.5063,2.5856,7.8537,0.0023,0.0092,8.0742,3.2561,1.6355,7.9144,0.1854,3.6458,6.4547,0.0828,1.0786,2.7436,2.414,5.3986,4.8221,5.6403,0.6907,1.1754,0.8775,4.6561,1.1548,5.786,4.8803,0.2329,0.1053,0.002,0.0161,4.8396,6.294,1.8177,2.7317,1.1297,4.1079,1.3877,0.2846,4.653,4.7225,1.7199,2.3127,0.9536,0.6251,0.0002,3.4843,3.6856,0.5044,1.529,6.5603,1.5733,6.9199,0.3942,0.8888,3.5929,1.832,0.031,1.7953,3.3921,0.0013,3.6028,0.0609,4.9047,4.8675,1.5988,0.7227,1.6182,3.7912,1.478,1.0492,5.6263,1.2183,0.0002,4.0676,0.0731,0.0269,1.8177,3.4465,0.0298,9.0428,0.2543,3.9174,3.3081,4.0585,7.5131,5.5511,7.6193,1.1325,6.3258,3.5093,0.3656,0.9793,1.709,2.8826,2.6047,6.6036,6.4732,3.6419,1.9562,7.039,2.2816,1.5002,0.0002,6.4228,2.3221,0.499,0.0454,3.8159,6.2221,3.3554,0.3308,3.0524,0.7325,5.7319,1.6992,0.8286,10.7047,3.1931,1.9607,5.5785,2.548,2.8205,0.1518,7.6977,2.3725,4.5048,1.3345,6.2187,1.621,4.474,3.5756,3.1326,1.5134,5.9444,0.0444,0.5541,2.7395,2.8796,1.8695,4.9954,0.4475,0.0002,5.9662,5.8779,2.7334,4.3606,2.1034,8.3747,0.2379,1.48,2.5615,0.9912,0.3151,0.0174,3.403,4.0988,5.1486,0.4774,1.9271,2.4306,3.8312,6.1548,3.1897,1.4859,1.6706,1.8752,4.6433,1.0936,2.7914,4.9311,1.6909,5.5163,10.2081,0.4145,0.0002,5.3629,1.2879,0.1443,3.1897,4.4878,4.4949,6.6583,1.8723,1.8992,0.0043,0.0046,0.4599,5.41,1.8412,8.7948,0.1578,7.8686,9.181,4.6398,0.3843,4.3265,1.997,2.1549,1.2648,3.2366,2.3517,6.1845,0.1926,0.6204,5.5158,4.8861,0.9814,0.5443,4.4117,1.3902,3.6874,0.0018,1.2364,1.6421,0.1098,1.5177,3.4253,0.7023,1.9982,6.4347,5.4501,0.3107,5.6011,1.8067,1.7974,2.7846,1.3351,1.8536,4.4721,1.4316,2.5019,6.3098,4.0245,0.2186,1.3202,5.3062,2.3647,0.0558,1.5539,2.6708,2.6733,6.2943,0.6958,1.2085,5.1355,3.3239,4.9562,4.482,4.4807,4.8774,4.7955,1.4464,3.0637,0.0486,2.7927,3.4335,7.5843,2.643,3.5956,0.9845,1.612,0.8595,1.2789,7.7124,4.0349,5.0719,0.722,2.8767,6.3054,6.8507,0.4918,0.9859,3.1053,7.1961,5.1415,3.2522,4.9062,7.8926,3.237,3.7034,0.0215,0.0291,0.9228,0.6605,0.0002,5.6187,4.2771,5.951,2.1191,3.2879,3.6025,3.023,0.0883,0.2097,5.637,4.5402,0.0008,2.785,3.8752,0.4835,6.6385,0.004,11.9133,4.0857,3.3574,7.507,0.3441,5.5645,1.7375,4.2979,3.4935,0.004,3.9394,1.1578,2.4871,5.1071,2.0014,10.5529,7.3659,1.0065,0.6775,3.2629,0.5468,3.5649,6.2755,0.1377,3.2379,1.4195,3.8218,6.8992,1.3693,3.3038,0.4774,6.2771,0.0068,0.1841,4.789,2.3466,0.9947,1.0315,1.0792,1.7692,5.0803,5.0494,4.4347,2.1238,1.6163,0.0046,0.007,4.325,1.2626,6.0051,2.1329,3.2947,1.7428,3.5533,2.2217,2.4256,0.0201,4.1686,8.6769,8.5763,1.784,5.555,0.9473,0.359,2.5957,4.1161,2.8564,0.1691,4.2926,1.1571,6.7699,1.4594,0.2195,2.7284,0.4672,1.7469,4.6203,0.1019,0.4595,2.5108,1.2392,0.7368,7.1566,2.2332,0.1432,2.87,0.4793]}
{"id":1119,"ended":true,"length":380,"text":"Three fluorides are known : XeF 2, XeF 4, and XeF 6. XeF is theorized to be unstable. The fluorides are the starting point for the synthesis of almost all xenon fluoride compounds [K. J. Lee et. al.; J. Chem. Phys. 114, 068404, 2013] while a few have been synthesized from fission products.\n\nIn spite of the large number of syntheses, no simple, inexpensive synthesis route for xenon fluoride has been achieved. A synthesis route involving the fluorination of C\u2013N bond in heterocyclic aromatic heterocycles could be a suitable alternative.\n\n2-Benzimidazole is a pyridine carboxamidine with the formula C6H4NCN. In its free acid form, it is characterized by colorless odour and has a sweetish aroma. The structure can be prepared by a reaction of benzimidazole with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide and potassium carbonate in water containing acetic acid. The resulting imidate is then treated further with sodium acetate to yield the free acid in 98.5% yield or by first producing the imidazole, followed by the chlorination and hydrolysis of the imidazole ring. The 2-benzimidazole ring can thus be fluorinated.\n\n2-Benzimidazole contains a methylene group at position 7 that can serve as the starting material for the fluorination of this nitrogen bond [M. Kawahashi et. al. Synthesis, 2013, 1049]. This can be accomplished by the use of N-fluorobenzimidazole (NFBI) or by the bromination of the methylene.\n\nThe mechanism of fluorination of the nitrogen in this molecule is believed to involve an F\u2013C\u2013H bond. If the reactants are in presence of a nucleophile, it will act as the electron of the hydrogen atom for the bond to be formed. The fluorine is present in the molecule in the position to act as the electron for the bond. This reaction is reversible. The product which may be obtained can be further purified with diisopropylamine, and is stable for a few months. The reaction was studied and reported in 2015 [J. S. Vaziri et al.; J. Chem.

{"id":4558,"ended":true,"length":478,"text":"Since the end of World War II, the Ministry of Education has issued statements and regulations to promote the usage of both the Hinomaru and Kimigayo at schools under their jurisdiction. The first such regulation was on March 30, 1948. Although it states a preference for the \"new, correct reading of the National Flag of Japan\", it was issued in time for the 50th anniversary of the \"rising sun Flag\" being adopted for official duties. The language was modified slightly with a new reading adopted on July 1, 1955. A new reading was again adopted on August 20, 1957 and a third on September 4, 1961.\n\nOn March 20, 1965, the ministry issued a statement recommending that the flag be used on June 12, the day Japan surrendered in World War II. The wording of the statement was not as strongly worded as the previous ones, and it left a lot of room for interpretation by a school official. Many schools have opted to use the Hinomaru on the actual date and time of the surrender, instead of the Kimigayo.\n\nIn 1990, the ministry changed the wording again. This time the announcement stated clearly that, \"In accordance with the Constitution, the Hinomaru should be displayed and the flag the Kimigayo....\". Since this is a statement, not a regulation, many schools have continued to ignore it.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the government made several revisions to Article 9 of the Constitution as well as Article 23. On December 7, 1989, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita signed an ordinance to declare Tokyo \"a prefectural capital.\" On that date, the national flag and the national anthem were adopted to be used in reference to the prefecture. The ordinance specified that, \"The Flag of Japan is to be displayed on all occasions at the municipal hall of Tokyo.\" The Flag Code, issued under Article 9, states that the Flag of Japan should be displayed, \"whenever the prefecture is designated as the capital city for the purpose of any state ceremony involving a state flag.\"\n\nBy June 1, 1993, the ordinance requiring the flags to be displayed was no longer in effect. In October 1992, however, the Flag Code was revised to specify that, \"the Flag of Japan will be displayed whenever the prefecture is designated as the capital city for the purpose of any state ceremony involving a state flag.\" It is this ordinance that was the original regulation, that many schools and prefectural offices have continued to follow.","token_len":509,"entropy":[2.3024,4.3661,0.0205,2.8809,0.0017,0.1893,0.1627,1.5312,7.4986,0.0834,3.084,5.1308,4.9911,7.2591,3.8105,3.5964,2.31,3.7447,1.63,9.2302,0.0881,6.7754,2.8537,11.9241,3.1094,0.6666,1.0156,8.0262,4.7802,4.1524,1.7149,7.9622,3.345,5.9268,2.8207,1.378,0.2901,1.7586,4.6995,3.5106,2.9844,0.6029,5.4555,3.0309,3.3935,0.064,3.1557,1.5942,5.0384,2.5734,6.3052,5.7011,5.9655,0.279,1.0261,4.087,4.8532,4.428,6.3295,6.8373,2.0827,1.1626,5.4232,5.8669,2.4625,0.5138,2.2856,1.4633,3.6018,3.112,1.7125,7.9305,0.3923,0.4666,6.2157,0.0283,0.1316,0.0626,0.337,4.3959,8.6527,5.2216,8.9933,2.3147,3.7077,1.686,4.327,5.1884,7.3495,1.1701,1.6358,6.4606,3.306,4.4221,4.1941,4.8989,2.5793,1.8803,5.1063,7.6273,1.4906,2.5024,2.2263,0.0818,3.7361,0.6185,4.214,2.4853,2.2691,0.879,6.9841,0.7631,0.2678,1.9002,3.7465,0.0649,2.3357,3.179,2.5576,4.1892,6.4914,0.8941,3.2087,0.0689,3.1721,0.2065,1.9894,0.0078,3.6316,2.7953,3.163,0.0481,3.4073,0.2633,0.5499,3.6047,1.2226,0.7662,3.1807,4.7499,1.0045,1.6215,5.8287,0.5105,3.0982,3.3063,7.1133,3.6738,0.4298,5.0675,1.3817,4.2563,3.7971,3.7134,1.7931,0.0012,0.0975,0.3138,1.1573,4.6665,1.4059,0.3207,1.2795,0.933,4.3604,4.8121,6.6097,1.0656,0.0004,0.2264,1.5179,2.4785,2.8805,0.9196,2.1412,2.1007,5.5199,2.8504,0.9789,0.5769,0.8881,0.0923,1.2397,4.046,4.3502,5.6817,2.9313,0.6227,5.2267,1.2269,3.0233,5.4661,0.9459,0.6584,0.4944,4.3377,0.0067,0.0045,3.0167,1.5793,7.0024,2.8599,3.9556,1.7204,0.4421,1.4443,0.254,1.2578,3.7148,0.1347,1.2307,8.3776,0.015,0.0146,0.0018,1.0519,1.234,0.0002,2.2076,5.3544,0.1986,0.6826,2.6989,4.358,0.5243,1.2297,6.045,2.0939,2.2074,0.1365,1.3041,7.2276,2.9477,7.2689,0.3022,4.171,0.8921,3.2953,2.2644,0.021,0.5676,4.2406,0.8669,0.8259,3.6274,0.0036,0.0057,2.1326,0.3676,3.3809,5.047,3.7981,3.4965,5.5421,6.0992,0.0135,0.0105,0.0031,9.8431,3.7336,4.2936,3.241,2.2335,1.7077,4.2365,2.8017,4.7293,0.4742,3.8808,0.1961,3.8312,0.5103,0.5851,4.7171,0.3166,5.566,1.0024,0.5785,0.8404,0.0002,4.9313,0.5374,3.504,0.1577,0.3704,0.9098,2.5227,3.7572,2.3544,3.8339,0.3027,8.0512,3.4237,0.608,0.1013,0.9443,4.7286,1.4376,0.2484,3.8564,3.9467,2.1836,4.7697,2.7083,3.2721,0.0263,2.6488,0.1658,6.4455,0.0021,5.8483,2.8099,6.8063,0.9109,0.688,3.7072,1.7069,4.3454,2.1225,5.2024,7.1891,3.4667,2.6801,6.493,1.0795,0.1605,2.6927,3.1699,2.3974,5.6099,0.7787,0.2891,0.9847,5.157,0.8891,3.7828,0.774,0.991,1.8982,0.4918,3.4281,3.6157,2.1707,3.0636,1.8524,8.2412,0.0221,0.7789,5.9009,0.9386,0.745,2.0376,3.6448,5.7207,0.4811,2.9424,0.5612,1.6725,5.6781,0.4013,0.8157,1.95,1.8656,0.1319,1.5586,1.8689,2.8503,4.13,3.23,1.4532,5.8348,3.9577,1.6603,2.2827,2.3829,1.8856,5.7318,5.1689,2.9254,4.3738,4.9066,2.5478,2.6946,0.815,1.9852,0.3378,1.6147,3.3833,2.3211,0.1085,1.2072,0.3109,0.7514,4.6179,1.5644,6.8869,0.0025,1.228,4.5408,0.1572,2.3071,5.3932,1.0211,1.86,1.9731,3.3123,3.3542,0.8417,2.0027,0.236,6.5972,5.1927,4.1877,5.3087,3.2298,2.9744,1.857,1.5722,1.071,0.0002,4.663,6.1685,3.0662,0.0273,3.1873,0.0775,0.632,5.4163,8.5092,0.9413,5.7936,0.8255,0.1638,0.4762,2.3391,4.4215,0.003,0.558,0.74,0.4133,2.5681,4.169,3.4253,0.106,5.122,0.0012,0.6107,4.897,0.0992,0.6162,2.4554,0.9886,3.2242,0.3228,2.2785,0.2354,2.6751,2.7648,0.2385,0.0724,3.9802,0.3336,0.3241,3.5123,0.8471,0.7903,0.0283,0.7225,0.2768,0.13,0.1018,0.1261,0.0808,0.2408,0.1213,0.0629,0.0026,0.2495,0.08,0.025,0.0233,0.0762,0.0719,0.0029,0.2844,3.8581,2.3058,3.7544,4.2406,0.3201,2.4137,3.1173,4.0059,5.6653,2.4834,4.9066,5.2948,0.542,3.6405,4.1874,0.0172,1.3109,2.8738,1.1821,2.9762,0.0413,5.0134,0.5191]}
{"id":3594,"ended":true,"length":479,"text":"Within days, Simpson was heading east again, taking a flying boat to Batavia, where he joined the advance party of the I Corps, which was being sent from the Middle East to the Western Front. As he passed south of Haifa, a local officer asked him, \" Where are you going, my friend? Where are you going in such bad weather?\"\n\nSimpson smiled knowingly, and replied, \" I am going to the Front!\"\n\nTwo days later, he was aboard one of the transport, the CUNT, bound for France, with the Australian 7 and 6th Infantry Battalions, one company of the Indian Cavalry, and one squadron of the Royal Flying Corps. The force was ordered to proceed to London and join the 7th Australian Division on the home station, and then be transported to France as soon as possible. Simpson was again the senior officer on board the transport, which was due to land off Le Havre on 8 August 1918. Arrived safely in France, Simpson spent a month there, and then travelled inland to the Somme area. His division was sent into the first major operation of the British campaign in Germany, which was to break through to the German lines. At the commencement of the attack, Simpson's division reached the town of Lillers, some fifty yards from the German trenches.\n\nOn the morning of 12 September, six machine guns were placed in the village of Fricourt north of Arras and began firing at the German lines. At 11, a regiment from Simpson's division counter-attacked, reaching the machine gun emplacements and setting them free, before advancing into a defensive trench the next day. The success of Simpson's division was due to the initiative and tactics of the commanding officer, who was also responsible for the divisional machine gun section. As a captain, Simpson was the most senior Australian officer on the field and had the difficult job of holding the machine guns against the assaults of the Germans, who were supported by anti-aircraft guns. Noticing that the Germans were abandoning their positions near the machine gun batteries, Simpson ordered his men to move into defensive positions near the trench which afforded good cover for the position. Despite the heavy machine gun fire, the Australian troops were able to drive the Germans out ; in addition, Simpson and his officers, who had volunteered to lead men into the open, were not hit during the attack and soon captured three German flags. During the attack, Simpson was shot in the thigh and taken prisoner.","token_len":510,"entropy":[7.708,0.9135,10.9469,2.4484,7.4106,3.9559,6.89,1.1415,4.499,1.8215,9.6476,6.5536,1.3557,9.0407,0.2726,1.1528,1.9903,0.3921,5.3162,1.3286,10.0973,2.4806,1.6378,1.4205,6.8948,5.6305,1.9633,1.8515,1.4579,4.5899,3.1671,3.036,2.3259,6.3556,0.1349,1.3159,2.0998,4.267,1.146,0.5796,3.7661,1.385,3.8641,7.1143,2.3987,7.4552,0.1443,0.3966,3.6949,5.0684,3.7743,3.4472,0.7696,3.2868,0.1588,9.3271,0.9295,0.3996,0.8222,2.4682,4.9655,1.6058,1.7372,3.4467,0.361,0.0845,0.2066,4.7321,6.5569,4.0583,1.8924,0.4913,1.6495,0.0036,1.6367,0.0,5.8833,5.8022,1.4016,1.4769,4.0831,0.4872,0.0298,2.1975,1.5341,0.8394,0.5118,2.5057,6.4395,4.4336,0.9112,0.0002,5.2791,0.6239,0.2275,0.1824,2.2327,1.5417,5.2226,5.1483,0.0275,0.2474,5.8134,5.8121,2.2684,4.5204,8.1534,4.831,1.9596,5.7999,0.0854,4.6352,1.9982,3.5694,1.4298,8.5559,8.2134,7.4088,4.241,2.0175,2.2584,5.3973,0.0008,1.4436,5.0333,5.9537,1.1505,2.6744,6.3335,4.5996,0.0007,1.0059,1.0671,2.6639,4.8544,0.1,0.3038,3.4517,4.2292,0.0327,0.5062,2.2773,7.3059,1.0585,4.4647,0.2472,4.9542,1.8458,5.7275,2.4204,4.2315,0.4347,5.9227,0.0377,7.4253,2.5795,3.6605,1.1279,7.5111,10.6559,2.5779,3.1303,3.0461,4.4902,4.536,0.6153,3.4241,3.4964,1.4773,0.007,0.2338,0.3752,4.0734,1.4623,6.4231,4.5154,6.7725,1.0246,2.4935,2.5017,0.6683,1.5529,0.6269,3.6669,0.9547,6.1646,0.2653,3.985,7.1798,5.9683,0.9732,0.0012,1.3478,5.0065,2.6044,4.7813,0.5143,7.6032,2.2269,4.6169,1.6444,1.3861,0.8363,1.2642,5.0288,2.896,2.9014,3.2711,0.881,1.8065,2.5189,4.9076,6.8706,0.8707,2.158,5.7582,0.0147,5.5111,2.1389,3.8244,7.0926,1.2817,2.3627,4.3468,1.4593,5.8746,3.9614,4.3618,0.9139,0.3721,5.0828,3.3489,1.287,3.5957,1.1766,2.4157,1.2519,1.2549,5.0539,1.5559,4.2116,0.8253,3.5347,3.5188,1.6527,4.0906,1.1827,6.9436,0.0493,0.5368,3.7793,1.0352,2.573,2.8797,1.4891,4.4225,0.854,4.583,0.0157,4.1322,5.2096,5.1769,2.3661,5.7509,4.2403,2.2017,0.8146,0.5028,3.2114,4.3145,0.9521,2.3245,0.0001,2.2157,1.533,1.7241,0.1055,3.9674,2.3476,0.4626,5.8502,8.9032,0.6527,1.0946,4.8512,1.1379,1.0199,4.0016,0.5669,4.9057,7.0004,3.1143,10.2462,0.0795,7.0756,1.1754,3.0671,6.0961,1.1599,2.1648,0.5303,2.1015,1.8302,0.5079,3.3343,3.6788,4.3149,3.0607,5.2919,3.6785,7.6292,0.0116,0.8603,9.4995,0.5762,0.6961,0.0087,1.9998,7.3771,0.6607,8.2096,0.7682,3.1294,0.0111,0.1694,2.9401,4.9359,1.807,3.4728,2.6641,3.5293,4.1055,3.1149,3.2656,4.6775,5.4313,6.2728,1.2078,0.4428,0.2086,1.7048,6.9049,0.1136,4.6193,0.0089,1.7048,1.8243,3.324,0.5617,0.8892,8.1664,2.375,5.5452,0.2235,0.9971,5.2304,0.4452,0.9047,2.5807,1.9456,3.6205,3.6286,0.0095,1.0625,5.007,4.1853,7.3313,0.4961,7.5273,0.7491,3.6993,2.5316,9.095,1.0271,1.4856,0.9727,3.0931,2.9334,3.3962,6.9761,0.6699,1.7905,0.693,5.2244,2.7991,2.2783,1.727,8.9658,1.8388,0.1253,5.1372,1.0348,5.6042,1.5696,4.8266,0.7021,7.1224,0.4743,0.4706,2.3652,2.4752,2.056,0.7066,6.9812,0.1518,8.347,0.0194,0.3957,0.0108,0.9698,1.0967,6.7005,4.5126,1.1593,0.806,1.9924,0.4585,7.0285,1.165,1.6853,3.4533,0.4028,3.1892,0.4063,7.0577,0.5369,0.9696,2.6482,1.1517,1.6139,0.1412,2.9239,2.9233,4.6544,0.3949,4.0192,0.1831,4.4486,5.1979,6.867,4.2382,0.3073,1.207,0.486,5.4045,1.1161,5.8598,0.9882,3.2545,3.4844,0.2851,0.3901,0.4789,0.8356,4.2755,2.3682,1.5195,0.6171,0.0126,5.0898,0.8638,2.0942,1.2633,12.0081,4.5828,2.5674,0.3629,2.9475,3.2687,0.4093,4.2038,3.4332,2.0512,0.8366,6.3071,0.8274,4.3637,7.1688,2.3539,0.8837,4.0723,0.9427,1.0262,4.8151,5.1944,5.1219,0.2807,1.9162,2.7924,5.7878,4.9055,4.4966,1.9354,8.099,0.7735,4.8243,0.4347,2.642,0.4494,1.9043,1.7065,3.7878,1.3046,0.0874,4.4271,1.3026,4.3417,2.2943,0.8234]}
{"id":2508,"ended":true,"length":439,"text":"Like all Hawaiian volcanoes, K\u012blauea was created as the Pacific tectonic plate moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth's underlying mantle. The Hawaii island volcanoes are the most recent evidence of the hotspot, which is thought to have created all of the major oceanic volcanic centers, including Indonesia, Chile, and New Zealand. Today, Hawaiian volcanoes are much less active than they were millions of years ago when K\u012blauea and the other Hawaiian Islands were active. The largest active lava lake is K\u012blauea's, which is located atop Mauna Loa and has held millions of tons of lava since 1992. The volcano's most recent eruption occurred in 2018.\n\nScientists had been concerned about K\u012blauea's lava lake for decades. In 1994, as much as 600 to 700 million cubic meters of water were being pumped into the lake daily to provide extra pressure to hold a \"spatter cone \" of lava above the deep water in the lake. After the 2004 eruption, the water level dropped to a point where the water table rose about 100 feet (31 meters) and the lake level dropped another 45 feet (13 meters) or so.\n\nThe first signs of this most recent eruption were fissures, small cracks in K\u012blauea's surface that often result from the accumulation of groundwater in cracks in the volcanic rock. These are usually nothing to worry about because they often quickly fill back in. But in June 2018, K\u012blauea's East Rift Zone burst into life with fissures that spanned almost 30 miles (48 kilometers) and spewed lava that eventually engulfed more than 1,700 homes in the Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens neighborhoods.\n\nThen came the lava lake. After the crater drained, the lava had nowhere else to go and it slowly began to harden. As the lava grew, it created what's now called Pu\u02bbupau Crater.\n\nThe crater wall of Kilauea is about 10 to 12 miles (16 to 19 kilometers) wide and the lava in Pu\u02bbupau has reached heights up to 300 feet (91 meters) above sea level.\n\nScientists say they're unsure how long the volcano's lava lake will stay full. If the source is shallow, it would be relatively easy for the water to return. If the lava lake were located deeper, it could be far harder to refill, because the groundwater table is high there.","token_len":510,"entropy":[5.5155,10.9642,6.4948,0.0272,0.3424,4.2405,4.3803,2.5219,7.0051,0.6891,4.4002,4.8876,3.3293,2.8351,5.9297,7.865,1.4555,0.0683,0.4441,4.2073,5.1075,0.6503,2.001,8.8307,0.1095,2.9101,1.2264,9.8158,0.0252,9.8931,0.6696,0.6488,1.8158,6.5052,5.3062,8.633,0.0605,1.8708,2.9331,2.0521,3.9113,3.5638,0.5634,1.6257,8.251,0.0352,2.8601,1.7268,1.778,2.9571,0.0177,0.6562,5.917,5.5923,1.2285,0.7371,4.7809,4.2102,0.9068,5.1751,6.5982,2.8428,1.3563,5.6552,0.6795,2.0824,0.2841,1.0037,3.5625,0.1831,0.2478,5.9042,0.2892,3.5159,0.7954,0.0148,0.762,5.0882,2.4708,1.6512,0.4829,1.7984,0.3089,6.4184,0.014,0.0056,0.0114,4.212,3.5563,0.1443,0.0033,0.0023,0.001,4.462,1.6851,2.5611,0.5585,4.1633,0.7195,5.3278,0.7629,2.5154,5.5321,4.29,4.1108,3.153,2.8891,3.0797,0.881,0.1329,0.0293,0.0115,3.0107,2.7913,1.0019,1.3656,3.2061,7.6936,7.3673,0.0937,0.4119,0.0003,2.8827,3.1478,5.4782,6.3875,0.0188,3.3485,0.0153,0.8848,1.2834,5.0503,0.1896,2.025,4.2691,1.8317,4.4589,1.027,0.8389,1.6775,0.7244,6.8306,1.2693,1.123,0.0011,5.299,5.7156,2.48,5.994,0.7012,1.4884,0.102,0.0046,0.0022,0.001,0.8506,2.6774,0.9852,0.9456,2.4027,1.2978,2.7022,4.6311,0.1662,5.4502,6.1,0.2215,5.1626,4.6143,1.5479,2.886,1.7176,0.3977,0.1809,3.2434,1.6759,4.67,2.287,0.5216,0.4464,1.1236,5.7469,3.579,4.0105,6.153,3.5017,0.9386,5.6408,4.6144,5.5439,5.4761,6.0604,7.1553,9.1258,1.5711,1.3227,4.1484,0.4431,6.644,2.8421,4.2047,0.3727,1.5455,0.4442,4.7123,1.6318,6.7477,0.687,0.6189,1.2568,2.996,2.7548,2.3514,0.9746,2.8812,3.804,0.6306,1.2697,2.6032,6.156,4.3629,3.8338,3.4078,2.3756,3.0064,5.4707,0.2943,0.6686,2.711,1.0014,1.3199,4.5042,1.4508,4.0545,5.5839,0.1604,0.0971,3.9713,0.0308,0.7052,5.6411,0.9442,0.5541,2.0548,0.0003,2.0059,4.7225,4.0076,0.1782,4.669,8.2942,0.0337,1.9127,1.4611,9.1846,0.5567,0.0988,3.6815,5.4424,1.5737,1.227,4.9426,0.1011,0.0059,0.0038,0.0011,0.1263,3.0798,1.5522,6.6918,5.5536,1.7355,2.3332,5.4667,0.0101,5.7241,2.3266,6.3969,1.319,0.3917,4.2056,2.6949,0.5745,2.7151,3.4405,3.0864,7.7831,4.2195,1.5389,0.0012,2.7226,1.9331,4.7628,7.0909,4.8432,5.8682,4.778,1.746,2.7291,2.0581,3.9668,3.2299,0.1414,3.132,0.074,0.0063,0.0018,0.0014,1.4189,11.3302,3.984,3.2887,4.4205,1.4117,3.5649,2.7101,6.0898,0.0175,0.0209,1.3742,6.6894,0.0958,3.4513,4.1165,0.3996,0.14,2.1254,0.2118,0.1436,2.5008,5.1328,0.0784,2.746,2.2577,4.7764,4.8241,3.9244,0.0424,2.6959,0.3507,3.5602,3.2016,1.8508,1.1296,8.4331,3.7688,0.3614,7.4918,2.1084,2.6552,7.8832,5.4419,4.7274,7.9733,4.1216,0.7689,1.1422,0.0002,6.0443,2.2649,0.8279,4.9458,2.1809,1.3489,4.4167,2.0377,8.2781,7.053,1.5431,1.1924,2.0353,4.4745,8.4401,1.649,0.0142,0.1509,2.1267,2.3301,4.0621,1.9322,0.5589,6.9796,0.0012,1.3294,3.1691,1.0155,1.1477,3.9339,1.2769,1.2615,4.539,4.6684,2.9914,2.1341,1.3977,9.0983,4.5905,0.0101,6.2949,3.7368,6.6625,0.0785,1.1553,2.6689,0.0001,1.9039,3.6693,7.5249,2.8367,1.3702,7.9292,0.0005,0.0013,2.0055,3.1031,3.1493,2.6237,2.1125,1.9863,0.1574,1.4951,0.383,2.9656,0.0792,0.0191,1.9375,0.8043,3.5769,1.7953,5.0618,5.0558,0.0003,0.002,0.009,0.0011,3.2996,4.1698,4.364,3.2582,0.0057,3.9893,0.0781,0.049,7.1841,1.3714,0.2766,1.3807,1.3856,0.0029,0.2187,2.6536,0.0002,3.542,3.6234,4.0446,3.2134,4.8021,1.6476,2.039,0.9102,2.6788,1.8606,0.9112,1.616,0.5017,2.8388,6.3245,1.4603,3.8714,1.6563,7.4837,1.0829,5.1042,1.2949,1.3126,2.6,1.8005,5.2335,1.5728,1.9317,0.929,3.2926,0.4983,4.321,2.6927,2.4995,1.1063,2.4451,1.9692,3.6944,5.9837,3.8712,0.8569,1.0894,1.6911,2.4677,5.4082,3.9177,0.4263,6.0646,3.0376,3.3873,0.9106,4.9965,7.8137,2.3627,4.4754,5.8286,0.4793]}

He claimed that at least four ID players were actually drug users who had received steroid injections prior to the gold medal game. It later emerged that a fifth player was also on drugs but, like the others, it was concealed from drug checking personnel. Spanish drug checking personnel at the time were told not to ask for ID because Spain was using ID players, and, in the interests of \" fair play \", drug checking personnel were also not allowed to give drugs to any ID player.\n\nSeveral drug checking personnel were disciplined by the International Amateur Basketball Federation but the Spanish Association was lenient and failed to disclose the drug use. The International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) then ruled that the Spanish athletes were to leave the Games. The IOC further alleged that Spain had violated \" the fundamental human rights of the people\" by allowing the athletes and that \" in this way, both drug consumption and doping were legitimized. \"\n\nIn response to the IOC ruling, the Spanish Association decided that all ID players should leave the Games. The players themselves and their supporters claimed that their rights had been grossly violated.\n\nSpain went to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, but was defeated in its bid to have the IOC sanctions lifted. On July 11, the Court upheld the IOC ban.\n\nSpain then appealed to the European Court of Human Rights ( CHR ). Spain alleged that, because the ID players were only allowed to use steroids and not banned drugs, their drug use was not doping. The CHR ruled that a right to the protection of the right to respect for the integrity of sport was violated by the IOC, and the athletes should be reinstated.\n\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport subsequently annulled the ban on the ID players.\n\nAt the same time, Spain dropped its other appeal, against the CHR ban, and all 16 members of the team returned to Barcelona.\n\nTwo members of the ID team did not return to Barcelona. A drug policy violation occurred in their absence. They were initially banned from the Games as well, but then allowed back into the Games by the Spanish government through the intervention of IOC President Avery Brundage. They were given bronze medals as a result. Only six of the 16 ID players were present with their respective teams at the Final, and, because of drug violations, Spain's medal count was reduced from six to zero.","token_len":510,"entropy":[2.3183,8.579,7.4693,3.3777,0.4648,4.0452,8.1347,5.926,1.8748,8.078,0.7359,6.5268,3.6325,0.013,1.0365,9.0719,13.3311,9.4971,3.8434,8.3083,3.2129,4.424,2.7768,20.4654,2.8221,4.7894,13.7794,3.1981,1.1019,1.5904,5.3775,8.4833,1.8411,3.2114,2.9946,0.6337,4.3868,1.16,3.6609,12.7616,1.5865,1.0253,4.7313,9.3303,1.6768,2.6754,2.0636,4.9188,7.8355,0.4765,4.7171,0.0047,0.5125,5.7168,1.2081,1.6633,0.4957,4.482,4.3504,0.5994,0.096,3.3298,5.5165,1.647,1.3538,2.1551,4.5966,2.868,4.2058,4.1755,3.7672,1.2397,2.1135,0.3967,4.9731,0.713,8.6271,1.3348,9.8716,9.9292,4.4621,0.5456,6.8738,9.6457,7.1898,1.2548,4.8697,0.5139,2.2513,1.8691,4.3756,3.011,0.0063,3.2716,1.729,3.5344,3.4504,7.0344,1.2987,6.0081,5.4679,5.2884,2.8214,1.9008,4.2536,2.0994,2.3881,6.6108,0.0009,4.8008,10.8241,0.8272,2.4521,8.2838,2.5442,0.4158,1.1464,4.7704,3.3319,0.8203,0.1504,5.4449,4.8639,0.3975,2.5507,3.2711,0.729,0.6722,1.8499,0.2143,5.8834,7.6848,3.6762,0.3522,1.7839,5.1639,1.8823,0.7666,4.0275,8.5975,3.4326,0.94,5.5683,2.6396,3.2822,4.8429,3.3056,8.7006,0.0008,2.154,6.5919,0.0724,6.2277,1.0357,4.4369,3.2272,2.4747,2.0718,2.9675,2.0726,0.0216,1.9441,4.1541,0.083,3.0868,5.46,0.4566,1.2906,3.7122,2.8276,1.2335,5.1076,6.8829,0.5769,1.8372,2.1435,1.824,0.8711,5.1856,5.7416,0.1108,3.6392,1.3572,3.4035,5.286,2.3088,5.8296,3.6789,0.1408,0.4145,1.4018,3.6561,3.7057,0.9522,3.1934,1.6792,1.7369,4.9867,4.9132,2.5416,5.1139,3.2027,2.8514,1.5732,6.3337,7.8218,6.3286,0.0743,2.5806,1.8006,6.4724,0.4668,3.0964,1.5792,1.0873,0.0003,2.0352,4.5014,0.2584,1.0828,1.2201,2.321,0.3088,1.171,0.9979,3.2314,4.9553,2.0329,3.768,4.7089,0.5357,2.1755,2.5628,0.4206,0.3423,1.0348,1.5378,5.1511,5.691,4.1138,1.3189,4.9828,5.7242,0.2491,3.2089,3.2987,2.1393,0.1164,9.1137,0.267,0.8898,1.693,0.0003,3.3957,5.6964,1.7546,0.7103,5.7566,0.0882,0.143,0.0018,0.0669,0.0026,3.3453,3.2914,2.9613,5.2627,1.5029,3.0872,1.5654,0.4489,2.186,0.4915,4.0717,7.436,3.7096,0.2791,4.7792,3.3441,3.3431,0.2197,3.7988,2.6093,4.8492,0.3419,2.1404,3.9708,2.8679,1.3294,0.0003,2.3036,4.6238,2.3484,0.7109,0.277,2.5857,0.3092,0.0235,0.0809,0.0019,2.094,10.9222,2.6255,3.8388,7.0673,0.1535,4.3779,2.8775,1.4293,8.1122,1.0249,0.7661,5.4151,2.6354,0.1586,3.1831,6.054,2.5006,2.2899,4.0293,3.4208,0.2448,2.7265,5.0414,0.098,0.6292,1.8062,7.0794,0.7086,1.3202,4.351,2.1505,0.2602,4.4587,6.3283,0.5276,4.0701,4.9435,0.0369,1.4271,3.1738,0.0865,8.0097,0.505,1.8899,3.5934,0.078,1.9575,1.0977,1.9733,2.1563,0.6069,2.9333,3.5212,1.0106,2.1833,3.4733,4.1099,0.9989,3.7111,0.623,0.7627,0.0002,1.7914,3.2883,0.545,0.0083,0.001,0.1934,0.013,4.6121,8.5856,0.0053,0.0024,0.2809,1.3668,1.7018,1.2042,2.7742,0.3785,0.923,1.105,0.0003,5.1259,0.3493,3.1309,0.0429,0.2404,1.5924,7.8776,1.3829,8.3486,1.245,2.3485,5.1272,0.4828,5.3222,3.9122,1.2835,1.5115,6.1479,5.8927,3.4281,0.0978,0.2265,4.8812,4.0228,0.1794,5.2329,0.7519,0.8828,0.0003,6.1494,4.5839,0.104,0.3446,5.8503,0.8374,5.6655,0.6949,0.5347,0.3432,0.8918,1.8138,4.1145,9.1209,4.7829,2.273,3.2331,1.3866,4.1572,3.6139,0.7731,3.5873,0.8086,6.0746,2.9124,0.6639,1.7204,1.849,4.1888,2.566,1.5832,0.4902,2.9215,5.1045,2.4791,1.9576,0.314,1.5888,3.5303,0.7639,1.4326,3.3441,6.5872,1.2119,6.9358,0.0096,5.5343,3.231,11.7492,6.0225,2.2522,0.9314,0.3685,3.8082,0.943,4.4534,9.8519,0.3606,4.1929,2.6964,0.4105,1.6011,6.4831,4.1324,1.1384,0.3431,1.0689,3.446,0.2807,1.5228,5.0444,5.4375,1.8852,4.0318,2.5428,2.5324,0.1443,6.5714,3.118,1.2409,3.9603,3.6556,0.9065,7.524,4.0922,0.3123,4.3209,2.3075,3.8359,2.6481,0.9048,1.7963,1.5637,4.8163,0.2144,5.3653,0.1877]}

The display included a 1.1-kilometre-long cascade at this spot.\n\nThe gully became popular because by this time, the river had become relatively clear, and the waterfall could be seen distinctly from the air by the locals.\n\nThe gully was also visible because the creek was deep and its waters flowed to the sea. The town of Port Adelaide was situated on a strip of land which ran along the edge of the headland.\n\nCreek\n\nThe creek rose on the south-western side of Mount Lofty and flowed southward into the Adelaide River. The creek mouth was at the location known as Waterfall Gully.\n\nFarms or land were frequently purchased for grazing purposes and this became a popular sightseeing spot for the early settlers\n\nPonds and dams\n\nThe creek was fed from springs which were springbanked into the river. These springs would flood when large rains came down.\n\nThe upper part of the creek was very steep and narrow, while the lower creek was open and wide.\n\nCattle\n\nThere were several cattle stations situated on the northern side of the hills.\n\nThe area was also a popular grazing area.\n\nThere were also many mills which used the timber of the hills and the fresh rain water.\n\nRoads\n\nIt was first surveyed in 1864, with the first survey being done by a Mr. M. Thompson. In 1866 the first coach service, called the Port Adelaid Express, left Port Adelaide to travel to Adelaide.\n\nIn 1892 a carriage and cart route was opened to connect the Port Adelaide area to the Mount Lofty Hotel in the city. In 1900 this route was extended to join with the road from Prospect to Port Pirie.\n\nToday\n\nToday the Waterfall Gully walking and camping track follows the northern edge of the Mount Lofty Ranges to the Adelaide River.

The population was still too large for the number of seats to be allocated to it, and, in 1912, the election for the parliament of Ireland resulted in the election of an almost equal number of National League members as members of Sinn Fein. Indeed, the increase in the Catholic population of the North caused by the movement of emigration was a major contributory factor to the growth of Sinn Fein. However, in 1912 there was no talk of partition.\n\nWhat caused a political upheaval was the economic crisis that commenced in Ireland in 1913. A combination of the Great War and the collapse in the price of British food exports caused food shortages throughout Britain. The Government of Ireland Act, which brought Northern Ireland under direct control of the British Government in 1912, included a clause that Northern Ireland should be placed in a special economic position. It was envisaged that the special economic position of the North would be achieved by providing economic assistance in the form of special relief measures for the North and by the establishment of a special monetary fund for Northern Ireland.\n\nThe economic and financial position of Northern Ireland was so bad that, almost immediately after the outbreak of war, the Government of Ireland Act was amended by the Government to provide that all the existing special economic provisions in the Northern Ireland Act were to remain in force until the financial situation of the North improved and, by the end of the war, the special economic fund should have been created. As a result, the Government of Ireland Act remained law as far as the North was concerned, though, like the Northern Ireland Act, it was superseded by the Government of Ireland (Ireland ) Act 1922.\n\nThis change in the law resulted in the removal of all economic and financial powers from the North Government. The result was that the Northern Ireland Executive (including Northern Ireland ministers) had neither the powers to introduce special relief measures for the North nor the power to establish a special economic fund. The only alternative was to establish a parallel Northern Ireland Parliament. However, as Northern Ireland was not prepared to be a part of the Republic, there was no need to do so.","token_len":510,"entropy":[8.3718,0.7559,6.0064,9.9265,5.3561,2.0417,0.1053,2.9014,0.5348,0.0075,0.1004,1.2454,0.0043,0.0563,1.1447,4.2098,3.7939,0.7066,3.4074,4.1802,0.5785,3.4746,2.6756,5.0606,1.3375,3.9767,0.2531,8.1965,1.79,0.0065,3.0424,0.2349,0.7594,5.5146,0.4234,2.4922,1.9146,7.0952,1.2564,0.5022,1.9777,0.7813,2.5371,1.5294,3.9224,0.3103,1.8976,0.062,1.0511,4.5509,2.6216,2.2747,0.021,5.1956,0.0651,0.0043,0.9211,1.7712,1.9549,0.545,3.18,0.0035,4.1912,2.9819,5.6751,2.3865,0.0447,1.8136,1.6899,2.0903,0.0505,1.8286,0.4244,1.5135,0.0077,4.3442,6.0031,0.5095,1.1071,3.2503,0.2554,4.5171,0.0861,3.7711,2.4163,5.0845,2.0606,1.0919,1.3849,4.1791,2.5914,2.8332,5.8589,1.645,1.6839,1.0034,8.2199,0.2038,7.1833,2.8864,0.8498,4.1761,1.3714,3.4714,1.8942,0.9335,4.5873,2.1594,7.1405,0.1997,0.8502,4.894,2.8274,0.7347,7.1558,1.9608,1.8093,5.0806,0.0234,1.2578,3.0537,0.0977,3.3895,4.4867,3.2154,0.0825,0.0311,5.1864,8.5888,1.6549,3.0546,3.7332,0.0924,3.2381,0.3666,0.4958,6.5608,0.1559,1.3384,5.8836,0.0795,0.4156,6.8078,1.1139,2.7246,1.8698,1.3177,3.2487,3.9688,0.3361,6.7257,0.2873,8.2786,1.4786,2.4611,3.3633,1.6387,5.1182,0.0027,0.0573,0.9696,0.2405,5.182,0.1406,3.6353,0.0478,0.6232,3.8541,0.0181,3.0125,3.828,3.2673,0.6248,1.6642,7.4631,0.1301,4.3618,1.3085,1.2655,0.0002,4.9064,3.593,4.1892,3.2631,1.6985,2.3179,0.8066,4.6563,1.2727,1.9725,5.5992,0.4651,3.2045,0.62,3.4964,0.4612,3.8626,4.9962,0.0037,1.8754,3.8782,4.6475,0.7441,0.5468,3.7355,2.3479,0.7731,4.7316,0.026,4.9412,6.1235,7.1343,2.0152,7.4746,1.7563,2.9607,4.7245,0.4779,1.3425,5.2341,1.3766,1.3136,8.9172,3.141,2.6348,3.8371,7.1844,0.0499,2.6241,5.3888,0.5186,0.1605,0.1935,1.7056,0.9527,2.0193,3.7051,0.1847,6.034,1.3881,2.3532,1.7288,8.896,0.1519,3.167,1.603,4.9029,2.4912,1.5406,4.0513,2.5997,4.242,1.5466,3.1214,1.4127,5.4953,0.0011,0.144,1.5487,6.6633,0.42,0.0901,2.4892,1.4008,1.7382,0.59,1.5901,4.9742,0.682,4.1119,5.5753,1.922,3.8361,1.3753,0.4003,0.0017,4.806,5.5966,4.717,2.3753,1.0313,3.7429,2.0016,2.9458,3.5963,2.9323,0.0226,0.9053,1.2713,4.4902,4.1905,1.0154,1.7376,0.0698,0.3918,1.1047,0.0002,1.1425,3.1266,3.7111,2.4209,5.0429,0.0343,0.9271,0.0066,0.965,4.0839,2.704,0.1189,2.573,6.7444,1.1555,0.3688,0.2514,3.7802,0.0015,1.4398,0.5717,0.6299,1.3705,0.3532,0.0564,2.4092,1.1855,3.0538,2.6824,1.2248,3.9496,5.5329,1.9492,2.4872,3.8251,2.9196,4.9307,5.4016,0.7692,3.4885,2.6519,0.5589,2.2654,0.326,0.5079,2.2061,1.0787,2.9162,0.3993,0.5447,1.5677,0.7947,6.0979,2.1445,2.2559,0.6711,1.5906,2.6499,2.8163,2.4989,3.7612,2.092,0.9633,0.0035,1.2277,0.7705,0.0284,1.0055,3.0345,0.407,6.4551,3.2357,2.3599,0.5914,3.3899,0.6965,4.5045,0.545,0.2491,0.7305,0.9577,3.0528,0.2615,0.016,0.3147,5.6781,5.357,4.2904,4.0517,0.4414,1.5162,3.1005,0.4955,0.0023,2.1963,3.9229,3.3971,5.7071,1.2191,2.1539,0.4806,0.2351,0.5942,0.6203,0.97,6.132,0.0011,0.318,0.6352,3.528,0.134,0.4926,5.8423,4.9216,7.2786,0.2427,3.9205,0.6401,0.4618,0.0002,3.4037,2.4354,1.1611,0.4698,3.4124,4.1388,0.0403,1.2084,5.3474,0.0389,2.1743,4.1592,1.0546,0.2808,4.3142,1.2522,0.8345,1.1999,6.8629,0.9354,1.247,5.5274,0.3859,0.7024,0.9177,1.8274,0.229,4.475,2.8997,5.4708,3.4831,0.0396,6.5492,0.6321,2.5134,7.3922,0.8797,2.485,1.478,6.0796,4.3897,4.2725,0.4665,1.295,0.5048,0.1474,0.1517,1.0392,1.0575,0.0498,3.0415,1.0991,0.1407,1.9055,4.0171,1.6869,1.5207,4.0784,5.2496,1.4929,0.6219,3.7869,0.4117,7.9851,3.9874,0.3318,7.2858,1.3716,3.5169,0.0136,3.2074,4.5686,0.0058,1.5758,2.403,5.2643,0.174,3.2539,1.7638,1.5606,0.0027,0.44,4.374,0.8414,3.9252,0.2809,0.8965,2.7712,1.0898,3.6051,0.3687,0.3345]}

{"id":867,"ended":true,"length":448,"text":"The main facade of the cathedral faces south. The main portal is centered in the main facade and is the highest of the cathedral's three portals. Statues of Saint Peter and Paul stand on either side of the main portal. They were placed at the cathedral around 1881, the dedication of the cathedral, and they are two of only three extant statues by the Belgian sculptor Frans de Witt (1593\u20131653). On the north side of the main doorway, the main facade is divided into four bays. Two of the bays are square with the remaining two being round. At the ends of each of the two square bays, there is a small gabled wing which reaches from the second floor above the ground floor below the main entrance and the two columns beneath the dome to form two pinnacles. Each pinnacled wing has a square base and the upper parts of a polygonal form. The first bay, which is at the west end is the central square with the remaining bays having a semi-circular shape. The central square has a statue of Santa Maria that was given to the cathedral by the parishioner and benefactor of the cathedral, Pieter van der Woude (1784\u20131857). Over the entrance doors where the pinnacles stop is a mural depicting the life of Jesus as it unfolds within the context of Old Testament and New Testament history. On the interior, the main square is broken up into three arches and is decorated with murals, including one by Frans de Witt. The most prominent of the arches is the central one which is topped by a gilded and painted polychrome dome. The dome has eight ribs that are decorated by the ribbons and crests of the dioceses. On either side of the first bay from the ground floor below the first gabled entrance is a small semi-circular room that can be used for baptisms, funerals and weddings. There is a small entrance for the sacristy at the north-western corner along with a small chapel. At the east is a large altar and on either side are small altars. On the second floor on either side of the central square entrance are small chapels for the use of female devotees. On the third floor is the choir and loft which contain the four altars of the cathedral. The choir has a round shape and at the level of the clerestory above the nave there are four smaller chapels and an organ.","token_len":510,"entropy":[6.6973,11.8755,0.4277,0.5217,5.8725,8.1561,2.9608,2.1096,1.5454,3.3194,7.8085,1.8554,7.7643,1.611,0.6439,5.7291,5.145,2.5931,1.8221,4.0252,4.4746,3.7377,0.3691,3.1741,0.8395,2.6798,6.0966,0.3873,10.5215,0.1409,1.3422,2.9911,3.2404,1.4072,4.194,3.4414,1.6328,2.8123,0.0403,0.1461,0.2149,1.0315,1.477,0.6658,5.1815,3.3909,2.8377,2.6499,0.414,6.3364,7.3849,4.2516,5.2126,1.5858,3.4261,9.1631,0.6942,1.8207,1.6564,4.4211,0.5579,4.2259,1.2972,6.7073,0.3288,4.5031,1.721,5.3951,3.1819,6.0896,1.5943,8.7067,2.7756,0.048,5.4144,1.6943,2.139,7.1054,3.5031,3.8921,4.1919,1.797,0.5737,4.8402,0.5284,4.922,0.62,3.4337,0.8336,0.2075,0.0842,1.0704,4.9395,1.4452,1.635,3.3311,2.5629,1.2185,4.5881,0.3174,2.6803,7.3254,0.9066,1.3441,4.4034,0.981,1.3883,0.5555,0.0001,0.545,7.66,2.9425,2.4715,5.5807,1.5492,2.4323,4.359,0.9,4.145,0.2214,6.6244,0.1523,2.0044,2.0073,0.537,3.9895,4.8275,0.3814,0.0,1.2093,1.8749,0.706,0.2875,2.7627,6.5545,3.3858,6.9455,3.7394,6.3247,2.8347,0.4719,4.4989,2.2527,3.7668,1.6981,4.358,1.6065,4.262,1.3046,2.0924,1.2811,3.0551,2.7186,4.7841,6.4117,5.1967,1.1422,4.4908,5.3109,4.783,4.1159,5.804,3.2932,0.02,0.7733,4.4545,1.2673,0.0009,7.597,0.7615,3.1353,1.5597,0.8909,4.8055,4.2174,1.2193,3.0443,4.1889,6.5183,0.438,4.908,7.5985,0.4157,1.8002,5.3358,0.9525,0.9162,4.485,9.5276,2.6541,1.898,0.9904,4.0581,0.2669,4.6223,0.6628,4.4781,1.7012,3.68,4.968,3.7495,0.9476,4.807,3.5688,0.0034,5.2057,1.285,7.0796,0.1382,1.3614,0.0019,1.2739,0.5061,0.7269,3.4248,1.3331,1.8505,0.938,8.5503,0.2995,8.0699,3.5223,4.4735,1.6845,6.0397,0.3781,0.9697,2.6519,0.9529,1.3593,5.8101,2.2273,2.4029,4.2667,11.8537,0.051,0.7933,1.0498,1.9061,1.9408,5.7582,1.9567,3.0862,1.4555,3.4272,3.3469,0.4381,1.5356,1.9494,5.7483,0.0826,0.0713,4.7743,0.4992,6.6286,0.4307,5.2907,6.299,7.3247,0.6109,2.7232,0.0087,0.0344,7.4714,3.0604,0.53,6.6263,2.1703,1.1401,4.5158,0.4125,4.1326,5.1803,3.223,6.5019,5.4082,0.3341,8.0225,0.0184,8.337,0.686,3.6768,1.1085,0.0764,2.5371,0.2135,2.9447,0.3389,5.965,3.9238,1.0834,2.3309,6.2211,1.3922,6.3049,1.8734,0.4072,2.0665,7.3885,0.0921,2.0615,3.1688,4.1898,0.2953,4.6007,0.0002,3.0827,3.0659,1.5152,2.2212,4.6399,0.4259,0.2235,0.0382,1.3872,0.9844,5.5692,1.9312,1.5532,1.1787,2.0259,0.0079,0.5534,1.1305,3.7437,1.5107,2.3037,1.1935,5.6853,0.9794,0.6322,4.7785,1.3737,4.4979,3.8881,7.4497,5.2365,4.183,0.9723,0.9501,3.065,2.5194,5.6528,6.8244,2.6863,1.3542,4.3053,4.3432,2.4046,9.3505,1.5396,2.7299,8.065,0.0633,0.8581,0.8196,6.5745,4.8131,0.2983,0.0399,0.874,2.3701,3.0084,0.0324,0.1429,0.1812,6.2169,4.8761,7.6044,0.3916,5.4428,0.3797,2.9432,0.5383,4.4,6.165,0.6342,5.6464,1.3082,0.389,2.601,8.0479,0.012,0.1871,0.002,5.5107,2.7868,3.9108,0.4174,2.1952,1.3681,7.7535,0.7331,1.745,2.7184,0.071,1.5774,4.8375,0.1976,3.6123,0.8343,0.8074,1.7336,4.8155,4.3603,1.3026,6.1008,2.1806,0.1967,2.7108,0.1206,3.1384,3.4982,2.747,0.6772,7.4934,0.8748,0.6752,1.6992,2.2895,1.5755,3.5096,0.1131,3.4772,5.001,0.4253,1.7319,3.7773,2.5012,3.6584,2.0785,0.0383,2.8165,4.2095,6.0814,0.0069,1.2548,1.8421,0.5352,4.8405,3.1014,4.9879,3.0826,0.039,0.6977,0.058,2.0913,0.7709,7.7984,1.9398,3.4785,3.9484,0.0048,3.9427,1.2035,4.5384,0.0186,7.6863,6.1397,0.0048,0.5769,1.5192,0.3285,1.7856,0.3583,1.401,2.0138,6.4058,2.3629,9.4852,3.3327,6.4665,1.4538,5.4803,5.0098,0.0122,2.2579,0.9262,3.6489,0.4238,1.2957,2.141,2.6059,1.2449,4.9777,4.8178,1.2689,5.3147,0.2675,6.7473,0.3343,0.2805,10.0559,5.1022,0.0937,4.7701,0.7035,7.4892,0.2163,2.9691,1.5416,2.3021,4.4838,2.126,0.0022,3.0888,3.0826,6.8949,1.5893]}

{"id":3781,"ended":true,"length":455,"text":"The barque Edward reported a hurricane about 50 miles ( 80 km ) north of Grand Bahama on October 19. Several other ships encountered the storm between October 19 and October 20. It is the center of the system that is causing destruction in the Caribbean Sea.\n\nThe eye of the storm passed about 70 miles ( 110 km ) off of St. Thomas, the largest island of the US Virgin Islands, on October 23. Although no flooding or serious damage was reported there, the system has continued to drop heavy rainfall on the islands, reaching St. Croix with 9.23 inches ( 230 mm ) of rainfall in 24 hours. That brought the month's total rainfall to 22.28 inches ( 595 mm ), almost the entire annual rainfall total in previous years.\n\nThe US National Hurricane Center ( NHC) estimated the maximum sustained winds on October 23 at 110 miles ( 175 km ) per hour. Although much less severe, that made the storm a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale ( SSHW ). Category 3 storms have maximum sustained winds of 130 mph ( 205 km\/h ). Category 4 storms have maximum sustained winds of 155 mph ( 250 km\/h ), and Category 5 storms have maximum sustained winds of 175 mph ( 280 km\/h ).\n\nEdward is the third named storm in as many weeks to reach Category 1 strength\u2014 Hurricane Ophelia and Tropical Storm Fay passed the peak intensity of Category 1 strength on September 24 and September 23, respectively. That makes it the first season since 2012 when three storms of such strength reached Category 1 status.\n\nA tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch remain in effect for Puerto Rico, Vieques, Culebra, and the US Virgin Islands, respectively. The US NHC expects the tropical storm warning to be discontinued by October 24.\n\nForecasters expect to see the storm gradually weaken until it reaches the Bahamas on October 25.

{"id":255,"ended":false,"length":466,"text":"The end of the war drastically reduced military investment in the island. Increasing enforcement of gambling laws and the growth of Las Vegas, Nevada as a competitive center of gambling and entertainment put the industry at risk. As new gaming areas opened, gamblers simply chose to cross the island to gamble at the new, larger venues. Gaming jobs declined by more than 70,000 from the peak through the mid-1990s.[14] Although revenues were slightly higher than the peak level of the 1970s, the gaming system lost $7 billion, compared to a $5 billion profit in the 1960s.[7]\n\nSears, Roebuck and Company (Sears) opened a shopping mall in Newport Beach, California, in the mid-1960s. Sears and Roebuck built a store to match to compete with the Fashion Mall of Irvine, California and the Plaza Shops, which were opened by a group of investors led by John B. Neiman in 1959. Sears leased 2 acres and had plans to build 100,000 to 150,000 feet.[23][24] The Irvine company chose an open plan mall design with long walkways lined by stores or shops. Sears wanted to use a separate entrance for customers to exit and enter their car, which could not fit within the existing mall design.[24][25]\n\nBy the mid-1960s, Newport Beach had 2.3 million residents and was the second most populous city in Orange County behind Long Beach. To cater to such a large population of upscale shoppers, Neiman's leased 4 floors and planned to open more than 200 stores. The mall had a huge success and soon grew to 8 floors containing over 400 stores. With the rise of suburban shopping malls across the US during the 1960s and 1970s, many Orange County residents who once patronized the Fashion Mall of Irvine made their purchases at the Newport mall, driving down from Los Angeles.\n\nFashion Island was not the only shopping center to open around Newport Beach. The city also had a mall at the time called Balboa Village Shopping Center along Balboa Peninsula.[25] In 1965, the Newport Center Shopping Center opened at 26761 Pacific Coast Highway which housed numerous retail stores. Also, at the time, Orange County had only 4 traffic lights, one each at Main and Coast Hwy and Balboa and Adams, the major east\u2013west arteries. This traffic increased dramatically with the opening of the Newport Center, and a traffic light was added at Adams and Main\/Coast Hwy.[25]","token_len":511,"entropy":[6.774,1.3627,0.8275,3.7148,11.1248,2.0017,5.0118,6.3744,0.7269,1.4962,6.9138,1.4383,8.0769,10.2031,0.6529,8.6408,0.6445,1.8096,2.3564,7.0564,0.0935,9.6091,0.0019,3.616,2.991,4.8049,0.9455,7.5708,5.1195,0.6321,1.9007,3.179,1.8547,6.4642,1.5967,6.0044,2.2563,1.1892,0.5274,4.1732,6.0603,4.7518,4.5481,1.7213,1.7563,7.3756,0.004,7.4895,6.57,0.7037,6.4607,0.9243,3.9714,1.8878,2.7525,2.7968,2.1209,4.5178,4.7902,2.9649,2.0245,0.5061,5.7042,7.5045,4.631,2.4449,2.6972,0.0058,3.8218,3.2687,0.0017,2.6488,2.0819,3.8819,8.0913,0.8222,2.4894,0.2236,0.9513,0.0822,6.3438,3.8741,0.0871,5.6367,6.9111,2.5801,5.8553,0.9215,1.4274,2.0321,3.6672,5.6327,1.409,1.5663,4.94,0.0359,0.3182,1.4406,4.4592,7.4574,4.9656,4.0517,4.028,0.782,3.4528,4.6324,0.5879,2.8723,1.6411,2.8116,0.4132,2.9886,1.2537,0.9364,3.6464,0.0054,0.666,5.0998,0.0641,0.7617,0.0002,5.0593,7.0267,2.0232,9.6351,0.0258,0.0566,1.7271,5.7532,3.5331,2.1526,4.2745,0.7523,5.6249,1.8803,8.3878,1.0656,0.6019,5.116,0.5565,0.5264,0.5634,1.3233,0.6393,2.7375,1.7318,0.1493,2.3815,0.0031,0.984,3.6563,3.1261,0.3234,0.0001,0.0046,4.5722,1.3466,4.9858,4.655,5.4036,7.1356,7.1599,0.3507,1.1486,12.2442,4.4444,3.4608,5.882,1.0453,0.3724,3.3109,1.7478,5.499,6.5403,0.3591,2.1766,2.5029,1.9195,4.6671,2.3492,4.3035,2.4919,0.2273,4.1581,4.2964,0.0072,3.6945,4.7069,0.6514,6.7185,4.2657,2.6319,4.827,0.6226,2.3724,5.8393,5.8866,4.4773,3.6946,4.2299,4.9106,0.2622,1.3504,5.1096,1.9844,0.0188,4.2015,1.7782,0.0039,0.0009,8.1856,6.3795,7.6142,3.0208,0.8995,0.1821,1.662,5.0082,5.3934,7.0534,4.3066,3.5805,5.033,10.5844,4.8882,2.6471,6.2961,3.7905,0.089,7.0178,1.6298,5.851,5.6356,5.352,1.5464,2.3601,5.491,0.5266,3.7764,2.1497,5.8187,4.344,1.4073,5.3779,1.494,4.9828,2.2337,1.153,3.7509,5.6438,1.6816,2.2929,3.032,4.0982,4.9412,3.5257,0.5379,4.0109,1.037,3.7533,1.3478,2.4504,2.0264,0.372,0.142,1.6401,0.0001,4.7262,0.8355,1.2941,0.059,1.7118,0.0026,0.1483,5.5606,0.1561,1.6673,6.1089,2.195,2.3888,0.0756,1.2945,1.4078,2.2268,2.1434,2.1056,2.1091,0.9413,0.4351,0.1943,4.793,0.0065,4.8358,6.4933,0.0127,1.4199,5.9744,6.7963,0.3532,6.4883,0.4888,0.7455,0.6425,2.7493,5.7514,2.8121,0.2929,8.3552,0.0009,2.6112,10.093,5.3323,8.2052,1.8854,5.0437,1.3549,2.6711,4.3811,1.5064,2.7312,1.7182,1.997,1.6119,2.308,3.7663,1.6408,5.6964,6.6874,2.8938,5.3758,4.116,0.3777,4.3607,4.0972,8.1156,2.8862,4.1814,1.4983,1.1784,4.7071,1.33,4.533,0.1066,7.1713,1.4344,1.518,4.8926,0.2542,3.7176,6.2727,0.0506,1.5295,0.0047,0.9309,0.4528,0.0002,0.1046,3.5747,5.463,0.1011,0.9297,5.6611,5.6569,7.2994,0.0118,1.0703,7.6078,0.0302,1.063,0.0656,6.53,2.1239,4.9239,1.4305,1.2729,5.5489,4.9475,2.5971,7.1426,2.7141,7.3249,4.0782,0.0057,1.7279,2.0767,0.0001,5.6732,0.9534,7.2193,2.578,3.6391,1.744,0.3509,2.776,0.812,1.269,2.5664,6.3219,2.9836,0.0761,0.6313,1.9021,4.6583,2.5262,1.912,1.0756,5.541,3.5275,1.2687,5.6283,2.0241,8.4642,1.0061,5.0674,4.6807,0.1147,6.7038,8.3012,0.0016,7.8207,3.9495,2.7287,0.1553,2.4699,3.4357,0.1859,1.173,3.0391,5.4965,5.9782,0.0955,0.5296,2.3445,6.131,6.4465,7.4267,5.2707,3.3462,0.4115,6.2828,4.4509,5.5638,2.6578,1.0324,1.6611,6.0091,2.0176,3.5385,0.6158,0.2885,0.7841,6.9155,0.0568,2.0554,3.5692,3.8363,8.7381,3.032,1.7831,3.8056,5.4385,1.8294,5.5627,1.6837,6.7931,6.3533,0.0831,2.1127,5.0364,0.0004,4.3981,12.3697,3.31,3.7055,6.2288,5.2749,8.9181,0.0338,4.6916,2.1059,3.947,5.3523,7.8098,2.5139,3.133,0.5608,2.8484,0.0195,0.5915,3.2229,0.4192,3.307,2.3697,4.0964,4.6676,0.5896,1.8552,1.0529,1.6636,7.451,2.3068,0.8588,6.2727,5.063,0.1523,0.2854,0.0108,3.1262,1.4108,0.0753]}

{"id":2029,"ended":true,"length":491,"text":"On February 1 in New Hampshire, Nixon announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination, commenting that problems `` beyond politics `` needed to be addressed. Immediately following his entrance, the media quickly took note of the fact that Nixon was speaking at a Methodist church rather than an Episcopal or Roman Catholic church. Soon, other details made Nixon look even more unorthodox- including Nixon's having recently purchased a home in New Mexico ( where he had grown up ), and the fact that Nixon had a pet monkey named China, along with a pet poodle, in his White House office. At the time, the media portrayed Nixon as an eccentrically eccentric figure who would play only a marginal role in the presidential race if elected.\n\nThe media portrayed George Wallace as an eccentric because his running mate was a woman ; as was expected by the media, the media treated Nixon and Wallace as a pair of eccentrics. Both Wallace and Nixon were given significant amounts of time on television and were featured on major news shows.\n\nDespite the fact both men were eccentric and were given more than ample media coverage, neither man was nominated that year. The press did not think the public or the other party wanted to run a candidate who was eccentric. In 1968, Republicans chose Robert McNamara as their nominee, and Democrats chose Hubert Humphrey.\n\nBy 1972, the Watergate scandal was making the political world pay attention to President Nixon. The media began giving the president more attention. However, as the Watergate scandal developed, Nixon's bizarre antics increased in frequency and ferocity. During his first campaign speech in New Hampshire, which focused on the economy and the middle class, Nixon was interrupted by the national anthem being played from the crowd. Nixon responded that he was the president of the United States and `` you don't go on national anthem duty for the first time in the middle of a speech to a crowd that big. `` If we want to talk about the American values, `` said Nixon, `` maybe you should give us the time of day. ``\n\nMany believe that Nixon's response was unhelpful. At the time, there were many people in the room who disagreed with Nixon's economic policies which led to the 1973 recession. Additionally, it seems many people in the audience wanted to talk about Nixon's controversial activities in Vietnam. It is true that the American values were not an immediate concern of the audience at the time. However, there are those who believe that a president should respond to the crowd's wishes, and not the other way around.","token_len":511,"entropy":[8.2658,3.2647,5.6944,3.4855,3.8427,0.1048,9.634,3.3455,1.8878,2.1354,0.5161,1.5034,2.1429,0.6007,2.0217,9.8532,1.0329,10.4637,12.2417,16.4926,4.6978,5.4863,5.0448,0.2713,0.0363,1.0385,0.5861,7.8671,2.1672,1.4524,7.7158,1.7352,2.3885,3.2885,4.5448,4.11,2.4905,0.5386,1.2175,3.2778,0.0308,1.1386,1.5715,4.981,1.7553,0.6724,8.0767,0.9168,7.4142,0.0031,2.7682,3.7576,4.8177,3.3992,0.0117,0.8813,0.4353,6.2692,2.4258,5.1759,7.2318,5.7071,7.1928,2.5165,4.3703,0.443,6.3891,7.3527,5.9263,6.3271,0.2256,6.8618,4.6404,5.4814,0.7004,3.9918,0.5399,2.8688,3.2131,4.3118,9.6066,0.5737,2.1007,5.2324,0.0324,3.0173,1.1152,1.6487,0.5167,0.038,2.4191,1.0781,3.4387,6.3883,3.824,2.2231,9.8089,2.8637,5.2868,0.0026,1.5101,4.5832,5.112,1.0428,3.2459,1.7293,1.0056,6.0987,0.0099,3.3646,0.354,4.6688,0.9287,1.0395,0.2769,1.7678,1.8745,4.6769,0.5399,0.2224,2.3456,8.3321,0.6928,0.4854,0.011,5.1113,3.0463,1.1203,2.8109,5.5106,4.9425,1.4342,3.7316,0.0943,0.2193,1.2526,4.044,2.0505,5.6399,1.3258,0.3951,2.678,0.136,2.44,2.3332,4.9981,8.9089,2.8923,0.3193,1.9629,1.8964,8.2244,3.4761,6.6414,0.123,2.0187,1.2981,4.6865,8.0632,4.2486,5.3183,8.0862,6.1345,1.4998,1.3117,0.4001,1.9654,1.2343,4.6615,1.1144,4.4112,0.69,0.5565,3.3208,3.2364,0.6813,8.3112,0.0599,0.9687,1.0586,4.8508,1.0825,0.032,0.2585,1.2146,5.4142,5.5426,4.7968,0.0082,2.8727,2.2834,1.7658,1.8274,3.8964,4.452,1.5023,5.043,1.6636,2.0162,0.9273,2.712,0.0002,4.6679,1.1016,2.2784,9.2279,1.5445,0.8923,6.2014,2.1334,3.706,3.7407,5.3869,2.6776,3.0532,4.5156,1.1294,0.3173,3.5327,1.6692,1.3048,4.7455,7.6365,1.2756,0.6058,2.3494,3.5135,3.0588,0.251,5.5215,2.7092,4.3837,6.3687,1.1002,7.398,3.3717,3.4378,1.0358,6.7464,1.7251,1.6118,1.2846,0.9368,2.5793,0.9579,2.7331,4.9715,0.1665,6.4171,5.2124,5.0885,2.1879,0.0611,1.2051,0.3006,1.0756,2.0002,1.5603,4.8417,1.5565,5.5971,0.0063,0.01,0.0002,1.6898,1.3903,0.0003,4.3006,2.3643,0.1362,1.5689,4.477,0.3241,1.3388,4.2254,2.3219,3.2069,2.2293,4.6652,0.2328,1.3414,4.5913,0.8904,0.6295,1.8999,2.1648,3.1961,5.5796,2.4895,2.162,2.166,1.2623,2.2267,5.2391,0.0066,3.9559,1.5741,1.5016,0.3635,4.1041,0.289,1.7893,1.3052,8.637,4.2671,4.9335,2.8805,2.6494,1.5265,7.8121,0.2905,0.2425,3.5798,1.6631,1.2628,3.6422,4.0484,1.4396,4.6682,0.3387,0.6148,5.0497,5.346,0.4873,1.2604,3.0201,1.2912,1.5515,6.5687,0.0395,0.1265,0.2974,3.3386,3.6566,0.2413,2.3277,4.9692,2.7638,4.9286,0.1067,4.7054,0.6948,6.1167,0.6002,2.1194,2.8524,3.6722,0.8503,1.5383,4.3309,2.8391,1.4477,0.0844,0.0403,0.0022,1.3678,6.1313,9.3815,3.5097,0.011,4.6619,3.2439,4.1435,5.7418,6.7093,3.8701,2.0303,3.2465,0.3205,1.2524,3.0306,6.7394,0.0654,1.6062,4.6821,4.2696,1.51,1.7365,2.7145,8.7373,1.403,2.8485,5.8897,3.7415,3.1515,0.3472,3.3041,0.0943,1.4946,4.0026,7.9985,1.234,7.538,5.502,0.3282,0.7735,0.6152,6.875,2.9782,1.34,4.1638,1.3396,2.1671,2.9425,1.7687,0.138,1.3667,1.7546,1.7655,0.0003,5.4979,6.168,0.5233,0.8115,1.3901,6.4634,1.8611,6.2586,2.8921,0.0028,1.3995,4.5948,1.1699,0.6619,0.3231,3.768,0.9645,2.2789,2.6751,1.6541,0.4928,4.8373,0.7839,4.5263,0.107,0.8356,0.9819,6.057,1.5326,6.2778,2.8768,0.1945,1.3757,5.4921,3.3151,0.4561,6.0908,0.0047,4.2162,3.8801,5.3641,1.7248,1.7198,0.1506,2.289,4.5371,0.5697,3.5181,0.1647,2.2735,0.3545,4.8342,6.4011,2.7191,2.5351,0.8214,4.071,1.3608,4.3233,0.0836,1.8761,4.6592,8.2213,1.6436,1.9043,5.3437,4.7243,2.4438,1.2725,0.6969,4.7763,3.1897,0.2586,0.0517,1.2217,0.9063,0.006,3.0281,1.9574,3.2718,0.1449,1.0777,0.3557,4.1768,3.5934,2.0756,5.5208,0.723,1.2712,5.3423,1.9969,4.85,2.964,2.0056,3.2993,2.4105,3.5823,0.0065,0.0377,0.2279]}
{"id":4717,"ended":true,"length":413,"text":"Herg\u00e9 attempted greater research into the United States than he had done for the Belgian Congo or Soviet Union. To learn more about Native Americans, Herg\u00e9 read Paul < unk > and Ren\u00e9 < van Pottelzebelle > Grinnell \u2018s essays about Indian life, including A Book of the Western Indians (1881), an illustrated encyclopedia-like book. He also purchased a copy of John A. Logan & Joseph < van Swaayenburg > Hunt\u2019s American Geography (1877), which was reprinted in 1912 and is now very rare.\n\nHerg\u00e9 and his assistants also began work on a new Tintin book, The Blue Lotus (1912), by the French journalist Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re. Dumas\u2019 novel The Three Musketeers (1844) was one of his most popular stories at the time, and The Blue Lotus was to be a direct continuation of that narrative, chronicling Tintin\u2019s adventures in India after he had returned to Europe. Once The Blue Lotus was available in Belgium, it would be known as Tintin au pays Indien (Tintin in India).\n\nWhen Herg\u00e9 returned to Paris in 1912 he began the work he called Les L\u00e9gendes du Tintin, a collection of stories in which Tintin was always the central character. Tintin would be depicted as a brave explorer, a skilled journalist, and as being a talented draughtsman of animals and nature.\n\nThe collection also featured Tintin in Africa (1913), Tintin au pays de l\u2019or (Tintin in the Land of Gold), and Tintin aux environs de la mer (Tintin at the Sea\u2019s Edge). In most cases this made Tintin the first nonhuman character to appear in a European adventure novel (the anthropomorphic animal Koko appears in Tintin au pays de l\u2019or, but it was published before Tintin au pays Indien, and the first book to depict actual humans is Tintin aux environs de la mer). In 1914 Herg\u00e9 traveled to New York City where he met many American illustrators and authors, including George W. Seldes (creator of \u201cCaptain\u201d Bluebell).

The boys should run in order!\" the commandant shouts at the last remaining SS-men standing on the road, all wearing brown uniforms. The camera cuts back and forth from the commandant to his terrified prisoners, who know that they have no chance of survival and must face death. In between cutaways, intercutting scenes describe the fate of the Buchenwald prisoners. The scene is recreated in as shocking a fashion as possible. When their camp is surrounded by the Red Army, the concentration camps at Buchenwald and Oranienburg are blown up and burned down. The SS soldiers are shot, but also many of the prisoners, who are too weak to run. At the end of the film we see the commandant M\u00f6lders running naked into the forest from which he has recently emerged, after having fled the camps.\n\nThe title of the second part of G\u00f6ldi, Die erste Sekunde, suggests that a new version of the film could be undertaken about M\u00f6lders, but the director, Ernst-Hugo Goms, is content to end G\u00f6ldi, Die erste Sekunde in 1964. He had already made an independent version of G\u00f6ldi, in the same year which was censored by the GDR because it contained too many references to what happened to the prisoners.\n\nM\u00f6lders'career and legacy offer an example of the challenges posed in placing the heroism of the German armed forces in the post @ - @ war cultural, political and social setting.' - [M\u00f6lders]","token_len":511,"entropy":[9.2394,3.7879,3.3123,5.7613,11.7775,4.037,3.8555,6.8815,8.1063,3.0118,4.5996,0.1641,1.8499,5.6396,5.5931,4.3776,7.9249,2.3355,13.488,0.5348,1.7738,3.4624,4.4634,0.0145,1.1733,0.7773,6.2139,16.5405,10.0907,3.9972,5.8103,10.7216,4.025,1.6623,0.5277,2.0778,8.4227,7.2888,3.7381,6.0879,5.0833,0.6005,0.0192,0.0155,2.0718,1.7596,0.0083,3.6698,3.557,0.416,1.5043,6.4685,7.1509,1.0888,3.9115,3.1282,2.3395,7.7908,4.6182,0.161,1.1882,4.6799,0.4283,1.4402,4.1134,1.4552,5.1866,0.0365,4.4095,0.6455,4.4598,0.1109,2.1582,1.9427,2.8292,1.4049,5.7533,0.0086,5.6229,5.4364,6.1295,1.3704,3.8394,3.1877,0.002,0.0005,0.9263,3.9772,0.4799,1.8361,4.1935,0.5649,1.5267,3.1124,2.4976,0.0034,5.0126,1.1494,4.3255,2.0875,0.6649,1.5678,0.0003,5.9631,2.9224,3.8925,13.275,2.8026,2.7941,7.0881,1.8598,0.3979,8.4946,3.4297,1.6675,1.6793,6.5842,2.8153,8.7598,7.0891,0.4928,8.7836,4.9552,10.2197,7.5401,0.0647,0.0145,0.0252,0.7731,5.3526,0.9843,0.9855,7.2788,2.654,2.7675,0.0463,0.84,6.6477,4.5987,1.8206,1.146,6.5184,0.2491,3.6381,0.0015,0.0006,4.4479,1.8029,2.4972,0.0088,1.6962,8.8921,0.2875,0.474,0.3999,7.9897,2.1057,3.2877,4.6395,6.3388,2.2088,5.4655,0.0392,5.0447,3.5206,0.3776,0.5808,2.7998,1.2947,0.7108,4.7626,6.7628,6.8482,2.1573,5.3523,9.9194,0.9286,4.6294,3.1444,0.3261,2.2064,3.3634,1.1228,1.1961,5.3651,6.2081,4.9774,1.0553,5.9559,0.0662,5.3304,2.915,7.2488,5.7208,4.8278,3.9589,5.247,1.8321,3.3465,1.4277,0.0236,2.0105,2.9296,0.7669,5.49,3.5677,1.4461,2.2902,2.471,6.2182,2.9097,0.2915,3.6594,2.0303,4.891,4.1984,5.9989,1.7122,1.065,2.3705,5.7897,3.3518,2.034,3.1242,0.4604,3.873,1.0083,3.2483,0.0482,1.2412,2.676,8.4241,3.2408,0.8242,1.9906,6.9006,1.2719,1.8249,1.795,2.5084,2.5117,0.7011,1.7043,2.9956,3.4109,4.285,2.9588,1.1818,3.9164,6.0439,8.1459,2.4282,1.0071,7.7088,6.8857,3.0413,6.7535,0.9062,4.6389,0.0473,1.0598,6.6098,0.0063,0.0049,1.7155,2.4942,2.1639,4.0909,2.5164,6.8846,0.0015,1.1853,7.5214,9.6809,1.1365,2.8464,0.0459,0.7014,1.3661,5.3396,6.3709,6.6411,1.0487,3.3673,0.2282,2.1203,4.5679,0.362,0.928,1.1081,6.2787,3.0327,5.4818,0.786,0.0008,0.0031,2.176,7.5733,0.3849,0.977,0.2873,1.2979,5.582,0.495,1.9494,4.6949,2.5599,1.0088,1.6271,4.4033,3.1318,2.1842,3.746,3.3364,3.1372,5.4224,6.5378,1.0022,0.7435,1.3783,2.8872,2.3076,1.4012,5.9354,2.0945,0.2732,3.7106,2.0954,4.1729,1.0894,0.8358,0.3757,0.2001,0.4318,4.7924,0.7268,1.204,3.5432,0.0384,7.3229,0.0536,0.0129,0.0083,4.9072,6.6339,2.9334,0.4997,3.9122,4.4627,3.1073,0.3912,2.5511,6.9784,3.9671,1.6032,5.0462,2.7732,3.9072,1.3846,3.2241,0.9269,1.4981,0.0003,1.5413,5.479,0.5686,0.3705,5.0575,2.0976,0.1675,6.9554,0.0095,0.0796,2.9623,7.1956,7.6676,2.8829,10.5635,4.7528,1.0295,1.3077,5.1091,0.4845,3.8764,3.9076,4.6154,0.0694,0.5883,2.2847,3.1823,0.7942,7.4271,5.3572,3.2785,0.0043,0.0022,0.0044,1.8033,3.5815,2.1937,4.184,2.8381,5.4876,4.4358,7.5825,3.1656,4.5835,9.3973,2.8019,2.6054,6.4692,0.5149,6.7472,7.4386,0.022,0.014,3.7493,4.3555,0.2773,0.0195,0.089,0.0012,0.0013,3.515,9.2356,0.6287,2.574,4.708,2.4432,2.602,3.0873,5.2601,3.1993,0.1955,2.6778,0.0181,0.0074,1.536,3.1725,2.9709,3.8191,1.1466,4.2771,2.6897,9.0677,1.0697,0.3701,5.8707,3.4621,4.874,1.6171,2.6269,3.9673,1.4311,2.4184,0.0376,6.6924,2.189,1.925,0.8691,2.1581,1.4785,1.6788,0.0003,4.0265,0.0292,0.0042,0.0121,1.4869,9.956,0.0091,0.1326,0.0072,0.1765,0.0066,0.0033,0.0014,0.0059,0.0086,0.0109,0.0045,0.0138,0.0012,0.0046,0.0008,0.0018,0.0045,0.004,0.0019,0.0102,0.0027,0.0041,0.1449,0.0863,0.0065,0.0084,0.0105,0.0065,0.0033,0.0053,0.003,0.0027,0.5373,0.0294,0.3299,0.0141,0.0025,0.0019,0.0024,0.0018]}

She co-wrote two tracks with her boyfriend, Taylor Goldsmith of the band Dawes (\"We Came As Romans\"), and two tracks with her sister, Kate, of the band The Lumineers (\"Let it Snow\") and four songs with her childhood friend Jake Reynolds, who is now her main songwriting partner.[21] \"Let it Snow\" was co-written and produced by William Bell (Bellarive)[22]\n\nSongs on the album include \"White Wine in a Red Wine World,\" \"Snow,\" \"Love on Your Mind,\" \"Someday\" and \"Roses in January.\" In an October 2011 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Taylor Goldsmith was revealed as a co-writer of \"White Wine in a Red Wine World.\" He revealed, \"We did 'White Wine in a Red Wine World' in December, and I think it's my favorite song on the album. I've been known to have a thing with red wines. She wanted to know if she could write a song about wine. So we hung out and wrote a song.\" Also in an October 2011 interview, Kate said that \"White Wine in a Red Wine World\" was a song she always wanted to write. She revealed, \"I just wanted to write this super slow, romantic wine song. To me, that's like the perfect slow-down song... We'd been playing it around the band, and then it kind of felt like at some point that Taylor was going to end up singing it. He said, 'No, I don't want to.'\" The song \"Roses in January,\" which debuted in October 2012, had also been first written during December of 2012[23]\n\nAfter the track list was announced in the U.S. on January 17, 2014, the U.K. version of the album was released on January 23. According to a tweet Clarkson sent out, due to problems with her label EMI, the album hadn't been released yet in the United Kingdom which led to the album title being changed to Heartbreaker. A month later, Heartbreaker was finally released in the UK and was available in stores, and online, on February 6. On February 23, it was released in the United States.

Early on 9\/24, the depression degenerated as it tracked into the deep waters of the western Caribbean Sea.\n\nLocated approximately 1,500 miles west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands on 9\/23, a tropical wave developed into a tropical depression on 9\/24. As the cyclone moved towards the WNW, it intensified, producing torrential rain and strong winds on 9\/25. On 9\/26, it weakened into a remnant low pressure area.\n\nAn eastward moving tropical wave that brought heavy rainfall and gusty winds to the coast of Guatemala on 9\/30 degenerated to a tropical depression. At the same time, a tropical depression developed off the western coast of Central America. The next day, Hurricane Sandy moved in a more westerly direction, intensifying as it did. Sandy quickly passed the northern coast of Honduras, before turning out to sea. Sandy was briefly considered a Category 2 hurricane, before weakening to a Category 1.\n\nLocated approximately 1,600 miles east-southeast of the Lesser Antilles, a tropical depression was located on 10\/5 moving in a WSW direction. The depression dissipated, just northwest of Guyana.\n\nLocated approximately 500 miles southeast of the Caribbean islands, a tropical depression was located on 10\/18. After passing the island of San Andres, the depression began to slow and become less well defined. It dissipated on 10\/21 south of Cape Hatteras, N.C..\n\nFog is an important problem in the North Pacific. A persistent foggy condition may be caused by a convergence of two weather systems. A dense fog called a \"stratus fog\" may be caused by precipitation that is sufficiently warm to allow for the water vapor contained therein to condense. Such conditions can occur during early mornings and late afternoons, when the Sun is high in the sky and the atmosphere is relatively cool.","token_len":512,"entropy":[11.1987,0.1419,6.8458,11.271,6.9106,8.5335,4.3048,0.45,2.9911,3.2096,2.9698,4.0712,3.2519,3.7059,1.1758,4.6287,3.0556,1.5762,8.9946,4.6863,0.6807,2.5307,11.3691,6.8473,7.2296,7.2793,2.4858,1.536,7.5097,6.1783,4.5028,1.9398,4.2378,5.8235,3.3451,3.8188,3.4707,8.2911,4.1353,2.1951,1.5413,4.7959,2.0099,4.2927,1.9465,1.872,0.7629,6.8778,1.9465,2.4039,2.7103,0.4732,6.1322,2.1476,6.1329,3.0357,4.5423,5.1368,6.0533,0.0314,3.9185,6.5653,4.8718,4.8809,3.198,9.5039,0.915,4.1957,3.9761,5.8076,0.2698,3.3314,0.6043,2.5449,0.1306,3.6152,6.8508,0.6166,2.9324,2.3333,5.5707,4.3302,0.5883,0.1244,0.1646,0.051,7.8033,4.3471,2.556,0.1193,1.6519,0.76,10.5237,0.3123,1.5295,0.0028,2.0414,1.5434,0.9387,1.8962,0.9038,3.0955,3.7137,7.4243,7.2251,0.1546,3.7687,5.0052,2.183,0.0654,0.2105,6.0932,1.1638,1.7063,0.0135,3.6707,0.5382,8.0769,1.8912,1.9127,0.011,1.112,0.3907,1.1147,3.5805,6.0157,0.0137,4.2438,1.0461,5.5999,4.8655,2.2064,5.9712,3.9814,0.4973,0.3187,4.7794,2.9984,2.5009,1.0406,1.7007,0.0003,9.105,3.9676,2.9645,0.7893,1.9125,0.8539,2.4332,3.0263,1.5936,0.039,0.0435,1.3878,5.1983,0.0141,0.0151,0.0036,0.1563,4.1478,4.2807,0.0658,2.3508,0.1914,3.3478,2.4776,5.7451,2.1524,0.3966,0.1253,0.2597,0.0724,1.5731,1.7904,0.0205,0.8972,0.5074,3.1826,1.8348,6.736,0.1987,1.7195,2.8855,0.362,5.6422,0.0664,0.8456,1.1975,4.8463,1.1293,5.1764,5.7238,0.0207,1.2334,1.1857,1.5662,0.1226,2.4257,0.9785,0.002,0.6778,0.251,4.3182,0.8359,0.002,0.7356,0.0959,1.9053,5.9635,3.1886,0.2143,8.7848,6.2738,0.8615,4.6848,2.0691,0.8428,0.0002,3.8632,4.7823,1.0427,3.2297,0.8523,3.5854,5.4774,6.3603,2.2562,0.6498,1.2493,5.4426,0.4109,0.116,1.3743,0.7826,4.5777,0.4641,6.6963,1.0342,0.8515,0.0025,3.2805,8.533,0.0157,3.7537,0.2452,0.3339,0.2194,1.8047,4.0414,1.9936,0.5944,0.0149,0.164,2.3198,2.4729,1.746,1.6555,6.5875,0.507,3.9204,0.4364,0.1415,4.2862,0.1282,1.4014,2.1744,5.4692,0.6129,0.2887,5.1535,5.0798,3.1014,4.0218,4.4238,4.9266,6.653,0.1115,0.0006,0.0962,1.2271,6.9927,0.0007,4.3153,0.3155,4.4317,1.3887,3.8169,5.9004,3.6355,2.3155,4.9124,2.3701,0.1309,3.749,1.3394,4.8058,3.5395,6.651,0.4237,7.1026,1.2331,3.3556,2.4888,6.789,4.2451,0.9401,1.7494,2.5381,0.3262,1.2778,3.3521,4.3761,1.7505,0.6303,1.7391,3.4081,2.8957,0.7045,0.0002,7.8943,1.5612,1.4429,0.0043,2.9691,0.007,1.8112,0.2488,4.222,0.007,0.0184,0.8572,8.2584,0.0586,0.333,0.0268,0.8785,0.8163,0.3265,3.0208,3.3564,5.4578,1.2766,1.0272,0.0301,3.1808,5.7113,3.5604,0.6969,4.9971,3.5916,0.9644,1.0778,1.7763,3.0088,8.1052,0.003,3.098,6.8694,6.3489,0.023,7.1161,0.0002,0.9869,0.9112,0.0002,4.4865,0.3476,3.1802,0.0118,2.6391,0.1754,1.0969,4.0812,5.0721,1.1738,0.3606,0.1553,0.8991,1.2291,0.2336,0.4428,0.3992,0.0052,4.8091,3.4259,4.6548,3.7028,0.8988,4.8595,0.0778,5.7316,5.2929,0.6653,0.6817,1.0197,1.575,3.1246,0.8931,5.0551,2.6076,3.7909,3.2781,4.0747,1.8832,0.9272,2.2177,6.4309,0.0014,2.476,0.3042,0.0014,2.0012,7.9431,0.8106,5.6854,3.8242,0.2241,0.0001,0.7584,7.1388,0.2159,1.4688,5.1697,0.5763,0.0003,5.8644,5.1052,5.7369,3.4633,3.3413,6.6601,1.5054,1.6346,5.5054,1.747,1.4741,3.381,6.9753,1.5743,3.7846,3.7271,4.905,2.3922,2.367,0.0264,2.0176,8.0659,0.2701,3.4271,5.4404,1.3139,1.2399,2.4985,5.1785,0.4789,6.4108,0.9722,2.348,7.1634,4.2712,3.0352,0.1579,2.351,1.9714,2.1593,0.0454,5.5434,2.7604,1.6077,7.0142,4.3574,0.8753,3.9463,2.7201,2.2638,6.1955,3.1003,7.0575,4.7117,0.0448,2.3151,0.0122,1.7409,4.1397,2.3845,2.1323,2.2868,3.1642,5.9664,4.354,0.8671,2.0277,4.34,0.0271,0.0001,1.1906,1.9802,1.1204,6.507,0.8962,3.4437,1.2065,0.054,1.9383,1.4148,0.9265,3.5077,0.2603,3.1003,2.6213,0.3195]}
{"id":1395,"ended":true,"length":450,"text":"The Omaha and Council Bluffs Railway and Bridge Company was founded in 1886 in order to span the Missouri River. In the late 1880s the city had five franchise companies providing transit services within the city center, and the city decided it needed a single company that could service all inter-city routes.\n\nThe Omaha and Council Bluffs was controlled by a board of directors from each of the five firms, four of which were controlled by Union Pacific; the fifth was owned by local businesses. In 1889 the name was changed to the Omaha and Council Bluffs Railway.\n\nThe O-C-B and B-S was leased to the Union Pacific Railroad in 1891. Soon after, the UP was bought out by Charles Stark Draper. Union Pacific took over the lease in 1893 and made a few small changes to the line. The O-C-B was leased to a new company, the Omaha and Council Bluffs Railway Company.\n\nThe line had five stations; Omaha, Iowa (Pioneer's Station), Fremont, Council Bluffs, and Elwood. Other stations also operated on the line that no longer exist; Elwood had been a station for the Chicago, St. Louis and SLC Railway, and was on line the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway; Council Bluffs had been a station on both the Kansas and Missouri Valley Railroad and the Omaha Railway; and Elwood was a station for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railway.\n\nThe O-C-B was leased to Northern Pacific in 1900, and remained leased to them until they were bought out by the Burlington Line in 1925. At that time both the Burlington Line and the UP began to lay tracks between Omaha and Council Bluffs again, and by 1928 the line was once again extended into Iowa.\n\nThe O-C-B was finally abandoned in 1961 after the Iowa portion was rebuilt.

The railroad filed an Interstate Commerce Commission application for a new railroad company. The application was filed under Title 11, Subchapter A of the Railroads Act of June 1, 1920. It was published in the Final Order of Approval on December 27, 1997.\n\nIn 1999, the railroad started running freight trains on the proposed route for a portion of its route from Wyoming to St. Louis. It announced plans to open up a route and terminal along the proposed Interstate 70 route for its own use only. This new route allowed the railroad to extend its terminus from the eastern terminus at Gillette and allow a more direct route to the Pacific Ocean. The railroad applied for a new Interstate Commerce Commission license to provide this route. The application was filed under Title 11, Subchapter B of the Railroads Act of June 1, 1920 and was published in the Final Order of Approval dated July 26, 1999.\n\nThe I.C.C. issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity, or CPNC, authorizing use of the I.C.C. route on September 5, 2000\n\nOn December 20, 2001, DM & E submitted a notice of termination to Amtrak regarding its lease of passenger rail service on the proposed mainline.\n\nIn January 2002, the railroad completed acquisition of all its interlocal and freight agreements with other railroads. This included agreements with West Central Railroad, Montana Northern Railway, and Burlington Northern Santa Fe to allow the railroad to complete both freight- and passenger-car deliveries.\n\nOn May 19, 2004, the railroad filed a petition to modify its license to take into account the addition of Class D local carload service. The petition was subsequently withdrawn on January 28, 2005.\n\nOn March 31, 2004, the railroad announced its intention to discontinue its interlocal services with the BNSF, which is owned by Berkshire Hathaway. DM & E cited customer and service issues related to inadequate intermodal facilities, as well as the loss of intermodal service which was previously provided over the BNSF between Gillette and Casper, through the Casper Terminal Services office. The company was unable to offer sufficient service levels at the Casper Terminal Services office. This decision followed a similar announcement on March 28, 2003, by BNSF which cited the same concerns for discontinuing the intermodal service.","token_len":512,"entropy":[9.5749,0.2224,10.5801,6.5016,4.5939,9.894,3.8764,0.1218,3.2579,3.4347,1.5156,9.1863,0.5656,1.323,4.2089,12.8496,2.5711,0.8665,2.4157,4.1433,1.7788,5.6893,5.7242,10.9651,6.1488,7.6228,0.6337,2.795,5.8174,1.8231,1.0759,1.9473,5.906,8.6408,3.325,7.8367,1.9553,1.2405,4.1114,1.5768,1.1818,2.8168,3.633,4.9575,2.7381,1.5287,2.4483,0.7456,2.8409,3.9849,3.3161,3.9689,1.0486,4.1204,0.1615,2.166,0.5602,0.767,7.4458,0.0119,0.2784,0.3171,13.8839,2.851,0.0263,5.2582,1.0008,3.7836,0.9225,5.825,0.8076,0.5868,10.8743,5.6772,0.2395,6.7075,0.0509,2.4131,2.9763,3.8613,0.0149,4.5404,0.4185,1.6453,0.0032,1.9717,3.4722,0.0698,1.1003,3.5884,5.2319,4.3956,5.3026,0.5874,2.4127,0.8281,6.4684,2.4246,3.7988,3.3304,4.077,0.0037,3.4336,2.5198,2.3406,3.8678,0.2166,6.0849,0.2133,1.3171,0.6615,2.6447,5.3953,1.6247,0.232,3.7547,3.6546,1.7107,5.4044,3.9876,7.5472,4.6707,0.2877,2.7688,7.6332,6.5076,3.5356,3.2041,3.7167,4.3171,2.2274,6.0073,0.8769,3.8144,4.0484,0.8469,6.9389,1.5283,0.5422,0.1183,4.7683,0.9798,8.2707,0.0869,2.3376,1.4866,5.8002,2.5673,0.0013,3.1604,8.614,1.7832,2.4451,6.0652,3.4371,4.1548,1.0143,0.7409,1.2632,1.3135,5.8087,1.7744,0.6902,1.4677,1.661,6.374,0.3424,0.8664,1.3502,6.1145,2.7439,0.0345,2.8672,2.0169,5.1153,4.7667,2.5725,1.3071,1.1808,1.6749,0.2711,1.6188,0.5395,0.1959,0.3302,0.0495,0.0599,0.0017,2.8095,0.0791,0.0048,0.1526,0.0093,0.0049,0.033,0.078,0.0566,0.0022,0.054,3.3166,1.1055,1.7826,0.2835,0.0606,0.2178,0.0176,0.0897,0.0305,0.0003,5.8208,2.9251,3.5314,0.0026,0.7329,0.1236,0.4318,0.0002,1.814,7.1181,3.0996,0.5583,0.0193,0.6288,0.0596,3.1132,0.738,4.6017,0.6977,5.7821,2.5177,2.8886,7.68,2.9462,5.9358,6.4471,6.6986,0.6255,4.7198,6.1871,0.1196,0.8162,2.771,0.1037,0.0021,0.0008,0.0032,0.655,4.181,3.0567,4.8273,3.4461,0.0211,2.1758,7.5707,0.0003,4.4955,2.6067,3.4844,0.0038,1.8114,0.1213,4.3733,0.1987,0.0091,4.0832,0.7834,2.8913,0.503,5.8362,1.159,7.6349,3.8952,2.2104,6.2926,0.7468,6.2345,1.3296,1.2611,1.5892,0.3991,1.2202,8.3865,3.949,2.7612,0.0002,1.8912,2.8695,0.5996,0.055,0.9378,2.1168,3.9544,9.3296,0.2508,4.6243,4.4994,6.2354,8.2413,2.6768,3.8162,9.2564,1.2047,4.3755,1.5236,0.4331,1.3725,2.9745,1.1529,5.0209,0.7786,5.3053,5.813,1.6128,1.0354,6.2555,5.5945,2.0035,0.3446,1.3463,6.5856,0.0901,0.0651,0.0213,5.3467,6.0343,1.8297,0.978,0.1823,5.836,6.2114,4.097,4.8701,2.7346,1.0887,0.2998,3.8466,6.6428,1.5156,1.1273,0.0002,1.3245,2.7456,3.4383,0.0032,2.4971,0.0676,0.6732,1.1235,2.1294,0.8,3.1343,1.7288,5.1576,1.3428,5.2177,1.3648,5.5804,5.4446,1.3225,0.9956,6.8955,0.0909,7.5317,4.0237,6.7832,7.4768,6.5911,3.4698,1.8514,1.146,0.7942,0.3485,6.1639,3.4667,3.8315,3.1764,3.4865,0.0226,0.4031,0.374,0.569,0.0002,1.006,2.8615,3.902,0.0039,3.1434,0.0625,0.4971,0.7468,3.3757,2.3949,1.2255,0.0245,5.2414,0.0011,2.3124,4.282,0.3466,4.2137,3.6211,1.3652,5.8333,1.9027,0.0638,2.9672,2.9036,2.7131,3.2338,0.1571,7.658,0.2135,0.0013,0.9974,5.0851,0.0987,0.0039,6.8046,8.2645,4.2918,3.5439,1.7268,3.4929,0.0097,10.2266,3.1182,8.3,0.0345,5.1264,1.3583,4.551,0.1434,0.0059,1.5613,4.5795,0.0674,4.4137,0.6737,0.0049,2.0782,5.6946,2.0092,5.8823,3.4726,6.1022,0.821,3.4938,0.0079,0.0009,7.4428,10.4118,0.0016,0.1699,8.6677,1.4509,2.1509,6.8282,1.1522,10.2856,0.0019,6.3711,7.5408,7.0653,0.7261,1.8753,2.8937,3.2948,3.0959,0.0188,4.9026,5.5493,2.1988,5.711,3.9009,1.1752,2.8851,0.0002,0.7992,3.0832,0.4564,1.5717,3.9787,4.079,5.4298,1.2784,4.6845,3.9555,2.4469,1.9105,3.2827,0.0502,3.4406,1.7104,1.6605,4.5797,0.0327,0.0015,3.6987,5.5258,2.429,3.6587,2.6673,4.0607,7.0888,0.2665,2.1694,1.6484,0.1081,0.0048,0.5484,1.2742]}
{"id":2370,"ended":true,"length":451,"text":"The location of Kennedy's wounds suggested that his assailant had stood behind him, but some witnesses said that Sirhan faced west as Kennedy moved through the pantry facing east. This has led to the theory that the assassin was actually Sirhan's first victim, Robert Grady, a 22-year-old Palestinian who was a kitchen hand and had been standing by Kennedy's side when an aide shouted at him to get into the pantry. According to the witnesses, Sirhan moved past Grady and shot Kennedy through the pantry door, striking Kennedy in the head. At the inquest, Sirhan's attorney, Vincent Bugliosi, questioned witnesses' statements that Kennedy's assailant had fired directly into Kennedy from directly behind. He pointed out that there were also witnesses and evidence to support the theory that the killer was to Kennedy's front ; one witness, Harry Meyer, a hotel employee, testified that Sirhan had leaned forward to shoot.\n\nCite this article Pick a style below, and copy the text for your bibliography.\n\nCitation styles\n\nEncyclopedia.com gives you the ability to cite reference entries and articles according to common styles from the Modern Language Association (MLA), The Chicago Manual of Style, and the American Psychological Association (APA).\n\nWithin the \u201cCite this article\u201d tool, pick a style to see how all available information looks when formatted according to that style.

Both generals also held the rank of full lieutenant general, which was later upgraded to general.[citation needed] Pabbarat was promoted to Deputy PM in 2004.[citation needed]\n\nAs Commander 3rd Army Area, Pabbarat oversaw military operations in northeastern Thailand and northern Laos during the Thailand\u2013Vietnam War (1955\u20131975). Later Pabbarat served as commander of the 3rd Army Area and commander-in-chief of the Ground Force. He was also commander of the Army Strategic Planning and Operation Area responsible for the training and instruction of the Army.\n\nHe had also been Commander of the Eastern Army Strategic Planning and Operations Area, based at Nakhon Phanom (now Nakhon Ratchasima), the Army's largest base of operations in Thailand for the previous 10 years. He was a commander in the 3rd and the 4th Army Areas, and concurrently commander of the 3rd and 10th Army Brigades which are now subordinate units of the 7th Army Area.\n\nPabbarat was reported to have clashed with the Thai military leadership and was suspended in November 2007.

{"id":4334,"ended":true,"length":493,"text":"After Houston received word that Santa Anna was leading a large force to San Antonio, Bowie offered to lead volunteers to defend the Alamo from the expected attack. He arrived with 30 men, 12 artillery, and 30 cannons. On March 11 he wrote a three-page letter, including a message to Santa Anna, offering a truce and an exchange of prisoners. As the fighting raged around him, Bowie tried four times to establish communication with Houston. The first time he managed not to be blown to kingdom come, but he sent no message, and Santa Anna's forces finally approached the Alamo. That evening and the next day, Bowie and his men defended the fort as best they could, firing shots into the night sky as American soldiers fell. On March 13, as it was getting light, a flagging Bowie asked Santa Anna for a truce, but his words were cut short : \"I ask of you but a few minutes to speak in the face of danger,\" he said, \"and that is all that is required in the circumstances...\" Santa Anna refused and fired cannonballs at the walls of the Alamo. A desperate Bowie ordered his men to open fire, but it had been only a few weeks since the Texas Revolution began and his artillery was far weaker than Santa Anna's. Over the next 48 hours, the Alamo fell. Santa Anna and his army seized more than 300 prisoners, including Bowie's son. About 30 Americans were killed, almost all unarmed, and many more wounded. In February 1836, after a few weeks of negotiation, Santa Anna promised not only to spare Bowie and his men but to withdraw his army at once. Santa Anna then rode to Nacogdoches, having fulfilled his promise to Bowie. He was welcomed as a hero and governor, and the people donated much of their possessions to pay for his trip home.\n\nHistorians have questioned Bowie's leadership at the Alamo. While there had been some fighting at the fort, most of the Texans had expected to die there. Most of the soldiers who were killed were fresh-faced volunteers, not the experienced veterans who guarded the Alamo. It has been claimed that Bowie was no hero who had sacrificed his life for his country. He actually served as a colonel in the British military, and was known to be a skilled and experienced fighter. Furthermore, it has been suggested that Bowie actually wanted to surrender rather than fight. However, Bowie took command at the Alamo and, despite his skills and years of experience, was an amateur compared to Santa Anna.","token_len":512,"entropy":[10.6592,6.2174,5.5676,1.0838,9.1143,7.5972,1.2155,7.9724,1.2286,5.4918,5.5267,1.7139,5.8811,0.6995,0.7709,10.9413,5.4871,0.8112,5.1325,8.0021,1.1098,5.3758,0.7685,7.5099,0.0098,3.6912,1.4082,8.288,1.5286,0.4956,2.7452,5.8786,2.4136,6.8334,2.2134,1.5436,5.9343,5.676,2.7748,1.0834,4.7105,6.439,0.8905,3.7497,3.5054,3.1393,3.645,6.6567,1.9882,7.2067,0.2166,0.5473,0.3044,3.7108,5.6378,1.2594,4.107,1.4529,2.7774,0.1063,1.2006,4.935,3.3466,5.6343,1.787,4.1853,5.8307,0.0293,4.2498,0.6091,4.7235,1.5804,4.3742,1.9028,4.3856,2.0983,0.2237,0.949,5.9221,8.5742,1.0025,0.0821,6.9891,3.7513,0.528,6.9072,1.2173,2.9808,2.4266,1.8512,0.8577,3.4941,5.5375,0.0379,3.769,6.98,3.6567,9.1238,0.931,0.6957,2.2558,1.9597,4.9165,6.2896,1.6741,2.7199,1.4862,5.325,0.0402,3.1245,4.1436,5.0087,6.8499,1.5171,1.9343,0.0003,1.7495,5.7828,2.5297,5.4888,1.3675,0.5188,1.3016,0.6461,1.8428,2.7193,1.1243,0.5367,6.6213,0.4875,4.5918,3.863,4.1164,0.1523,0.0387,1.3688,5.015,5.1856,2.3363,0.2925,3.5886,0.8005,2.7773,7.7164,2.5168,5.9773,2.7412,2.8986,1.5908,2.1395,0.3445,4.5273,5.3531,1.0203,4.3251,6.3287,0.6665,2.8653,6.1334,6.6311,6.2828,6.508,0.7978,0.0055,2.2709,1.7854,2.501,1.6474,1.4306,4.4683,4.7926,0.8732,2.9624,0.1078,13.0763,0.3563,2.0008,4.6192,4.1553,0.3373,7.3884,4.3942,3.3592,3.2366,3.0692,5.0334,3.9883,1.7658,4.4685,0.0029,3.9092,3.4395,0.8208,2.001,1.4824,1.3681,1.0894,3.1658,1.6398,2.4254,2.3282,1.3978,1.7564,3.9777,2.169,5.498,7.5969,3.4921,0.002,3.8154,3.1696,5.3168,6.9842,3.966,1.1971,1.1678,6.9404,1.4905,0.2195,1.2909,0.0003,1.0014,3.8006,6.2917,1.3802,3.8754,1.4185,0.2316,0.2847,4.544,0.0428,1.4144,0.7081,4.3005,5.7108,1.6983,4.8521,0.9809,1.005,5.578,0.4115,1.2606,5.4786,2.3208,4.1024,2.3233,2.755,5.6017,1.6994,4.6097,4.2463,0.3447,3.8608,0.0027,0.4376,0.3274,5.9019,0.4329,0.1353,5.6012,0.008,0.2883,1.4574,2.5199,0.0004,3.5529,2.8724,4.5781,0.0088,2.9383,0.9534,3.6566,6.9518,3.788,0.4841,3.6376,2.7585,0.9677,1.9162,5.9378,0.7648,3.5912,2.1024,6.1359,3.7131,4.7524,1.0009,0.4609,1.3862,5.8072,0.3371,5.5922,1.0143,0.8924,2.8819,0.9539,0.6629,0.4296,2.7587,4.5213,2.8351,4.1225,0.2766,3.2996,2.1221,4.3725,1.4809,0.5126,5.9261,0.592,1.5244,0.0099,5.5208,4.5004,4.7895,0.5257,5.6473,5.0933,1.9578,0.3874,0.5809,1.7582,0.762,7.0102,2.3725,2.7364,5.3753,1.8863,0.867,3.8035,0.009,3.5235,8.4461,1.5984,6.8683,3.3178,0.0218,0.0005,0.0014,0.993,8.3951,7.3804,0.6612,0.3412,2.115,4.2658,1.29,2.4096,2.7175,4.8747,2.98,1.0237,0.745,1.5567,7.2631,2.2614,0.9468,2.7856,5.1892,9.0643,4.5662,0.3714,1.1013,6.9489,0.7956,3.6762,0.4592,1.0432,6.6788,3.8095,0.2013,2.8695,0.1693,7.2354,1.3061,1.7001,5.151,3.1175,0.091,4.3642,4.167,1.1011,0.6415,0.0005,1.0521,4.5654,3.5179,4.4954,0.1273,2.9129,4.5372,2.8485,0.5908,1.3454,0.7307,3.4606,1.0405,0.6052,7.8819,2.3416,6.2796,1.9703,4.0854,2.8942,0.697,4.8765,1.0627,0.4094,3.0428,1.5519,2.5532,1.2628,1.2487,8.8715,2.6992,0.2596,4.489,1.4196,3.6096,3.7298,6.2742,2.9664,0.5615,7.8309,0.265,2.5838,0.0002,0.7985,4.3705,4.1662,0.3275,3.7822,0.2378,2.3166,1.8987,6.3007,3.0812,5.2685,2.4288,5.6672,0.6866,0.3891,1.04,2.2623,0.4795,0.6769,2.6154,6.3151,3.1566,2.0343,0.6553,4.4003,1.0395,0.3026,4.846,4.4445,1.6576,1.4797,2.2653,3.7846,1.0945,2.0169,1.2204,4.9875,2.7711,2.3722,3.2585,0.4718,6.7932,0.0064,3.8009,1.1002,0.1691,1.9171,0.1116,1.9777,5.4475,4.2792,0.2821,5.1163,4.2563,0.0042,2.0576,1.0443,3.48,0.024,3.4616,6.1309,4.2858,3.2418,1.1419,0.5775,0.0005,3.0127,3.503,2.8891,1.1741,7.9699,1.4236,7.5025,0.1917,1.9477,0.2729,2.0277,5.0365,4.8955,6.8564,0.1849,4.4983,0.0108,0.7628]}
{"id":1427,"ended":true,"length":469,"text":"Although prospectors, surveyors, and trappers had travelled the region in the 1800s, the first large scale activity in the river valley by Europeans was logging. J.P. McGoldrick, an experienced lumberman who owned a mill in the valley, first discovered the area a few years later. He sold the timber rights to the Canadian Pacific Railway company, hoping they would build a railroad up the river from their lumber camp at Canoe Canyon ( on the southeast side of the Bow Valley ). The local Indians, however, refused to leave their homelands, and the railroad decided not to make the journey.\n\nEventually the railway built a road through the Bow Valley from Fort Macleod to Joffre Dam in 1911. This allowed settlers from the eastern provinces to reach the city and the railway siding as early as 1905. The first settlers began arriving from Calgary at that time.\n\nAlthough several attempts were made by a few companies to raise crops in the valley, the mainstay of the economy is the timber industry. Several small sawmills use the natural resources and have been active in the valley since the 1930s. Timber trucks travel the long stretch from the main area of harvesting to the smaller industrial centres. The industry also uses the timber from cut areas, particularly in the higher reaches of the Bow Valley where it is too short to be transported further.\n\nAs more timber is harvested, less water will pass through the headwater reservoirs, although this appears to be limited to those areas being cut. If the valley is severely over-cut, the water could be seriously affected.\n\nFishing is another important industry in the Bow Valley region that could disappear if water levels are severely eroded by timber harvesting. The fish in the river are highly valued as salmon, trout and pike. The fishery is also valuable to the Aboriginal people who have lived in many river villages since time immemorial. These villages are now mostly deserted, as can be seen by the many abandoned villages that dot the area. The only fishing village that is thriving today is the hamlet of Canoe Cove, although other aboriginal fishing villages still operate in the Bow Valley region. The local people of all the aboriginal villages would probably be opposed to the commercialization of the rivers, preferring to preserve the natural environment.\n\nIndustry would probably cease in the region if sufficient water levels are not maintained. If the water quality is also seriously affected, industry would cease at the level where pollution and depletion of natural resources become an issue.","token_len":512,"entropy":[10.832,3.1938,2.6736,9.0213,0.55,0.4962,0.9177,9.1372,0.2578,4.8525,8.1653,3.5002,4.248,2.4217,1.6864,5.3685,0.2333,1.1405,2.7759,3.2526,5.0241,3.3613,8.1795,1.9797,1.1892,6.6155,3.2624,4.6537,2.9902,3.799,7.6263,1.0511,7.9827,1.8047,3.4742,0.0596,7.9462,4.6636,0.016,1.086,2.8529,5.8269,5.2719,1.8058,2.1486,4.3387,1.0533,3.9912,0.7989,1.8935,2.2021,0.471,4.9865,3.0983,0.8032,3.3056,5.4046,0.5287,0.3177,0.5425,0.8405,1.8229,5.7462,1.2312,3.7727,6.8316,0.5007,1.9693,5.1743,4.9668,0.3817,3.9667,1.7911,6.548,3.2057,0.3016,4.3023,0.6089,2.5673,5.0533,0.8841,1.2325,3.5966,3.8813,4.7444,5.9324,3.7484,5.8272,2.9042,5.8407,4.8806,12.4893,0.9634,5.4418,0.895,0.1367,0.5522,8.8041,5.6781,1.4982,2.002,6.139,5.7657,2.4055,2.2359,0.0074,2.5793,0.3331,5.6557,1.4264,4.7099,0.1967,0.0,1.899,0.8613,1.8339,2.6766,6.3935,3.2112,0.0011,4.1218,1.5757,2.7009,0.802,2.4745,0.1772,5.6955,2.0072,4.2197,4.4354,0.6294,3.0264,2.5245,0.2526,6.7652,0.4638,3.9078,5.2453,4.6401,2.7615,0.1648,1.4536,6.0775,5.6302,2.4946,7.2726,2.8525,4.937,0.8405,2.9415,5.1028,6.0731,2.8423,1.1909,4.1589,6.9788,0.4146,3.4443,1.0588,5.1995,2.2508,2.8325,7.5735,9.5524,3.1933,5.1327,3.8355,0.0076,4.2653,0.3474,1.549,3.5265,3.7177,4.4062,2.5648,3.8164,6.6336,2.969,4.3086,0.2076,1.1408,2.371,0.0002,5.002,6.0654,5.5727,1.4097,0.026,2.6228,5.1604,2.0518,4.9728,0.2669,5.9849,7.3785,1.2324,0.322,1.1586,0.3931,1.4254,4.4964,5.5918,0.2482,0.4629,5.5446,5.7456,1.4586,1.9502,0.9316,0.5721,5.6507,3.6384,7.5559,4.406,0.0183,7.7139,2.0416,6.5834,1.8452,3.7996,3.8723,1.5568,4.2926,0.4351,0.8514,2.2318,1.6563,0.7388,4.1253,0.1612,0.1949,4.8453,6.459,5.4293,2.2645,6.4861,4.4305,3.5905,1.8557,4.1104,6.0207,0.7475,7.7536,0.6237,0.4687,6.6247,6.7036,4.9174,1.4054,1.8627,5.1497,3.1535,3.504,1.7209,2.8635,2.7688,8.1057,6.8279,2.1954,4.6727,1.5405,0.7389,6.3489,3.6559,0.4403,0.2522,3.1212,0.3383,3.8246,2.923,0.8438,6.4257,6.3011,0.5975,2.5723,3.6513,5.4491,0.9185,0.805,0.0002,4.3873,4.5778,1.9995,1.2557,1.6437,0.8967,5.9667,4.7801,5.0385,4.412,0.3411,0.2538,8.2592,5.783,6.2457,1.8448,6.8106,2.2606,6.9838,0.0721,0.66,5.083,1.1932,5.1059,2.0939,6.7049,4.1585,1.6435,5.506,1.1306,4.6456,1.1447,6.5865,4.0472,1.3611,6.3976,0.6168,1.3445,1.568,4.1652,1.2971,8.6219,2.7493,1.0091,1.6679,0.0002,5.4406,2.5982,2.8176,2.3777,2.2112,2.2274,1.5997,0.0962,3.1495,0.146,5.3069,3.9933,4.788,8.1582,1.9362,4.7759,1.7575,1.3883,6.202,3.9449,2.7665,4.5044,0.782,0.1687,1.7202,6.3798,3.3404,0.2653,1.9888,1.7938,3.9854,3.8722,3.5389,5.4,1.3344,2.8761,1.8683,4.0934,0.2536,1.7369,1.9951,4.026,0.2249,1.2449,1.7705,6.1211,2.3613,1.0577,7.1357,0.7987,1.7778,2.5842,2.9987,1.0306,6.5533,7.1347,5.2711,3.1901,5.2775,0.0075,0.0001,0.0001,0.2589,4.6995,4.5359,1.5779,3.5698,5.1219,5.8202,1.4369,3.3333,4.7899,0.0602,0.108,2.6468,0.314,4.8581,3.7748,4.9364,2.7648,2.6627,0.1495,2.6774,0.3755,2.2994,4.1351,3.6008,4.2494,2.0656,2.1034,5.2223,3.2069,0.1584,1.5896,7.6606,0.0356,0.2381,4.887,0.0458,4.5116,1.3564,6.1811,4.2107,8.6759,3.7395,1.1217,2.7947,3.5964,1.7407,0.4148,5.1068,0.2083,2.6797,0.1645,2.6321,4.2823,2.9338,2.7883,7.14,2.2922,5.0502,2.0112,4.8836,3.0166,2.0966,6.3437,0.0514,1.5014,5.571,2.5054,0.1082,0.9323,6.0296,2.15,7.0188,0.7785,3.9409,0.9405,2.461,3.1646,1.3818,0.4558,0.0002,6.3789,1.4061,6.2587,3.957,4.3598,2.1224,0.3153,4.3296,1.3102,7.438,2.7399,2.7199,2.7772,2.1132,1.0457,0.7569,3.8001,1.1405,1.8638,6.0636,1.1279,6.0506,4.1952,2.7875,0.8423,6.5377,0.8226,2.3529,4.3785,1.4121,5.7099,2.8672,8.3408,3.1593,6.8636,0.9147,2.0141,0.2702,7.1716,3.0486,0.4777,0.1841]}

{"id":3316,"ended":true,"length":476,"text":"Being close to the west coast and the Irish Sea, the climate is generally temperate with few extremes of temperature or weather. The mean average temperature in the years 1971 to 2000 was 10.6 \u00b0C (50.2 \u00b0F), and the mean annual temperature is usually around 10 \u00b0C, while the coolest winter day was around -7 \u00b0C, and the warmest day is around 27 \u00b0C. During winter (December, January, February) we often see sunny spells and a drop in temperatures, but nothing like the UK and Ireland.\n\nThe summer is warm but cloudy and misty and rainfall is lower than in England, and only two seasons are needed for most garden plants (one being autumn).\n\nDuring the last 6 months we had a lot of snow on the ground to as low as 1000 metres. The ground was covered with a thin layer of snow with some areas a fewcm deep.\n\nWe also had quite a few frost in the nights (2 - 3 ) in May, June, July and August, all more than in England. I would say that we have a lot of frost in winter than England, or Scotland for that matter - sometimes even in July.\n\nDuring the winter (December, January, February) we often see sunny spells and a drop in temperatures\n\nOur spring weather is mild with sunny spells. Our summer is mild and cloudy and rainfall is lower than in England, but only two seasons are needed for most garden plants (one being autumn).

The winter is colder than England, but nothing like as cold as Scotland can experience.\n\nWe also have spring (April & May) with more than 100 days of sunshine.\n\nWhen is best to grow in Scotland? - We start to get the first sunnier weather around the 26th March. So it is best to get planting in June, September or October.\n\nWhat are the best vegetables for growing in Scotland? - There is an excellent list on the SPS website for Scottish gardeners.

Lane also designed The Oldham Town Hall, dating from 1831, [link] and Manchester @ -born architect John Skelton designed the rectory at the same time as the church,, dating from 1824.\n\nThe nave is a cruciform structure of six bays and one bay is closed by a two -centred arch [link] The westernmost bay is the easternmost in the nave and was intended to be a separate parish church to the town hall ; but the building has never been used as a parish church. The chancel is a small semi -circular building of two bay with a single -centred arch and is approached via a low vestry built into its right hand corner.\n\nThe transepts are connected by a porch with a pointed arched opening, a narrow window and a blocked arch. The porch also has a small square tower with the four pointed corners and a pyramidal top. It is supported by a low embattled wall with diagonal buttresses. The north wall of the north transept is supported by a buttress at the east end and a diagonal buttress and tall arched window at the west end. There are two side chapels which join onto the west end of the transept.\n\nThe churchyard is located to the north of the church. There were 19 listed items in the churchyard by 1991. [link]. The old cemetery is located off the east side of the church and was last used in 1961.[link]\n\nOldham Parish Church has a number of connections with Oldham's history, including being the place of execution of John of Gaunt, son of King Edward IV. He was condemned to death along with others and executed near the church in 1471.[reference] The local historian Roy Porter who had worked on the book on The Oldham Family says it is likely his body rests near the church [reference] However the church contains no gravestone and he and his possible remains have not yet been discovered. One of his alleged executioners is buried in St Peters Church, and a monument to him and his family is located in an aisle close to the entrance.[reference]","token_len":513,"entropy":[8.8609,7.03,9.8409,2.5112,1.9779,2.1405,0.8761,2.6851,6.5739,3.8232,0.1686,3.1444,2.0663,4.4019,5.0112,5.3332,1.6821,0.7063,7.6906,0.8497,7.1866,3.11,1.7608,5.7304,2.7563,1.717,5.2221,2.6034,7.2776,1.5931,5.2252,7.218,1.9586,2.6697,7.7127,12.9517,8.2506,5.7269,1.9086,7.7905,6.8493,0.8434,10.7071,2.1221,3.8034,0.0232,5.1037,1.2039,1.6012,1.2585,0.5716,6.9216,4.1836,1.3394,1.9608,1.5274,7.2963,0.0632,0.1024,1.6791,2.0129,4.368,0.712,0.1516,2.9178,4.1286,5.8767,0.9927,4.1381,3.4966,0.7219,5.8938,3.3205,1.0081,5.8218,1.415,0.9479,8.586,0.6051,0.908,4.1117,1.0774,5.284,0.0968,0.1019,2.6537,6.3239,3.2146,0.7304,0.4382,0.7353,3.2994,5.504,4.6725,0.1075,2.0098,0.7507,9.6297,0.152,3.0174,1.6359,3.4422,0.3026,2.1708,0.8451,1.7668,11.3364,4.3393,0.0479,0.3786,4.3506,0.6927,2.262,0.1252,1.9643,7.977,1.754,2.8176,2.134,9.3185,0.2693,3.7582,2.6933,5.0216,6.5592,1.5181,2.3254,3.8156,5.46,7.0767,7.3482,2.5418,0.8632,5.348,8.7814,8.4291,2.9807,2.7794,5.8958,0.1215,0.1984,1.8432,7.0333,3.764,2.5025,0.9069,2.541,5.1338,0.4941,5.7531,1.0555,4.4371,0.0015,1.9915,4.5182,4.6473,0.6532,0.7338,1.5138,6.6656,3.3054,0.7502,3.7527,1.2705,5.2805,1.5837,7.3276,2.1257,2.0193,3.898,3.6572,4.3342,0.172,2.8748,2.0686,0.39,1.5868,0.1626,1.2303,1.501,11.778,1.5821,2.4894,1.1933,4.7216,7.3531,3.2845,1.4385,0.0093,1.6382,1.9631,2.873,3.638,5.1043,1.0484,3.1116,6.7088,0.5336,0.029,0.098,2.7345,2.4642,9.9574,6.2334,0.8051,6.0423,10.9934,3.9437,5.3956,3.068,4.2515,5.9798,4.4271,1.8017,0.9347,2.6887,0.0003,0.8861,7.5037,0.3143,0.2416,3.3352,1.4929,6.0366,0.3728,0.8342,8.0174,2.0853,0.7273,8.051,4.9096,0.6173,4.9362,2.0205,2.3263,4.6855,4.7138,1.6414,0.6338,8.7965,2.2146,1.3544,0.8506,5.0045,4.1262,0.9587,0.5268,3.5813,5.583,7.487,2.1053,3.831,5.8964,5.3906,3.5893,2.7643,0.9102,9.3259,0.7416,0.0093,5.7739,1.2114,3.7506,0.8633,5.9854,0.2851,0.7634,4.731,14.085,3.6559,2.0719,6.9002,10.1055,0.1198,1.472,0.9882,5.5261,2.7976,2.2611,0.1256,4.5399,3.0501,0.0011,0.0012,0.796,3.5769,0.1371,0.5089,9.9102,0.1548,4.3078,0.4614,3.9077,1.0545,2.4377,1.0475,6.0839,2.9736,0.0604,5.0233,8.0044,3.0056,0.5543,2.9242,2.3877,0.0391,1.4937,0.0947,0.2801,4.2299,0.8844,1.5904,5.4732,6.4652,0.0089,3.5727,5.555,5.9948,0.509,4.1653,2.319,0.5571,0.0511,1.0934,0.0007,0.0009,1.002,1.4547,0.0002,0.6896,3.0298,3.4402,0.9445,3.0773,5.0284,0.0638,1.5259,0.424,0.2262,1.5054,3.3444,3.1007,3.9158,6.405,8.5813,9.2181,1.1733,0.5743,2.3191,0.0984,4.7216,8.1816,1.27,3.2768,0.2245,5.5478,1.9359,6.2164,6.4875,1.7248,1.7289,5.7414,0.9308,3.3273,0.6577,0.0678,0.1557,0.8923,2.8926,2.8694,7.1742,1.7046,1.5587,5.7259,5.8245,1.9922,0.1114,0.916,0.0002,5.8362,1.2918,3.1467,0.9758,4.1536,1.5646,3.0523,0.0032,8.2006,1.5869,3.4099,0.313,4.7326,4.2377,1.6132,1.0181,5.5368,0.8715,4.797,1.6852,6.2537,2.2914,4.0092,4.289,3.7044,0.1559,1.6259,6.1366,0.0275,3.0504,2.638,2.0822,2.0143,4.3062,0.5354,4.5414,0.6716,0.4736,5.5518,0.0467,4.9014,3.5778,4.5604,5.5876,1.2385,2.7122,2.2133,4.4033,5.1384,3.1652,7.5636,0.4741,1.9079,5.8465,3.7379,7.4667,6.7816,6.1437,4.9197,3.327,2.1481,0.6679,6.1612,4.0281,5.2838,0.8093,0.0416,6.7881,3.9773,3.6932,1.3821,2.9323,5.0351,6.5272,9.1382,3.2011,0.3012,1.5962,5.4227,2.5801,0.5441,4.595,2.7589,3.0452,6.7077,3.0012,6.8237,1.5242,2.1752,4.9605,6.058,0.6914,10.2148,3.6977,1.9628,1.4288,2.2988,0.022,3.0001,0.7099,5.422,1.0277,2.3833,6.8884,7.0433,0.7213,2.3744,5.0368,1.0201,5.1146,5.8668,2.7158,1.5862,4.6298,3.1578,5.3856,1.1466,1.111,4.4952,0.6784,1.6956,1.2874,1.8499,1.1826,4.5463,6.4505,4.9881,0.1947,0.2087,3.2206,3.6019,0.4157,0.0652]}

Now, what happens through the rest of the weekend will be interesting ; it should have good occupancy levels as well, and should do decently on weekdays. However, it would be interesting to see if it can get to the 20 crore mark by the end of the weekend or not.","token_len":513,"entropy":[1.9909,6.2279,10.2951,0.6454,11.7511,7.3874,5.8136,3.9576,13.2057,12.7941,7.1906,9.8859,9.2752,0.4548,3.6933,3.1628,4.316,2.2235,0.0255,8.007,0.1522,0.4476,1.2798,8.903,12.31,7.548,5.6863,8.8147,8.9579,7.7307,3.6711,6.5805,0.0122,2.3037,7.7407,2.9611,2.4189,7.1381,4.3611,7.0994,2.6659,2.1699,7.1208,0.2387,10.4918,1.2283,6.6173,8.9985,2.0143,5.908,4.4159,8.8975,4.6343,4.0661,0.6989,1.3788,0.0068,0.9025,7.4282,4.8104,2.1037,3.212,5.5439,8.3208,4.618,1.2435,2.3221,0.0114,1.7044,3.7461,2.8886,0.507,0.2414,0.0368,0.0476,1.7847,2.2652,7.349,0.9413,3.414,0.0046,0.4126,3.3159,2.4828,1.7761,4.4316,5.9252,1.5762,1.2097,6.1987,2.5331,0.7459,1.095,7.2464,1.214,2.8934,0.9612,3.7694,0.2244,0.0087,3.5329,2.8533,8.0965,8.3923,0.0097,4.2941,2.7408,0.8268,4.6652,0.0016,0.1728,4.2325,0.9617,5.6484,0.0533,4.1591,3.7087,4.7946,8.6627,6.524,3.5815,0.759,1.7894,7.1692,0.0045,6.637,3.1099,3.9866,1.4398,5.123,6.2702,0.5538,1.0829,3.2163,3.401,3.6662,1.4468,4.6485,0.4856,0.0463,5.8042,5.524,2.1888,3.4852,3.3753,2.1149,6.3871,3.0358,2.3689,2.3807,5.6691,1.3355,3.9628,5.2921,5.2144,3.8986,4.2763,5.0825,0.615,5.2646,7.0977,6.8393,0.9188,2.1826,1.4821,1.2138,5.812,6.4784,1.4198,7.4662,3.0865,0.2855,1.8558,2.0652,4.7732,0.127,2.5667,2.4941,4.9747,0.7803,4.204,0.7072,0.0591,0.4517,0.3444,0.755,0.1723,0.5063,3.4849,1.1856,1.6386,0.0593,0.471,1.1155,0.4147,2.2345,0.5496,5.6431,0.9699,0.0582,1.9634,0.7677,3.6968,7.1918,6.3747,4.7632,0.0362,4.3733,1.2288,5.4093,4.9484,0.9997,0.2722,1.9551,0.0002,2.2379,0.0924,0.0054,1.7171,1.5688,6.2092,5.9454,1.7571,0.9907,2.6947,9.6794,4.417,3.6814,7.187,6.5353,4.0544,5.9007,1.2385,6.9744,7.5105,1.7879,1.5651,4.6642,3.896,0.1012,0.0047,0.0616,6.0022,0.0766,1.8646,0.5511,4.7331,0.7858,0.5212,4.2956,3.5352,6.2267,1.7872,7.1804,4.7807,0.4637,2.6012,0.3319,0.1972,0.0069,1.3681,1.8432,0.0003,2.1728,1.8542,2.1962,3.8034,8.3171,2.7313,1.5018,4.7201,0.5341,0.4981,0.012,0.0024,0.0021,3.0181,3.8187,1.6389,1.711,3.0007,4.1021,1.3531,8.6343,0.2517,4.8009,0.8903,4.5311,0.1603,1.6382,4.5645,0.8437,2.8649,0.2584,0.0725,3.2863,0.1136,0.0287,0.0029,0.0107,0.0732,0.001,2.5556,1.7217,6.8337,0.9627,6.3564,0.4825,1.3225,2.7952,1.7222,5.5943,1.0819,4.3764,5.6971,0.0227,0.8293,3.0418,2.3924,0.5144,3.2,0.6327,1.1613,0.0684,0.0425,6.9958,0.0223,2.6079,5.8237,3.8056,7.0656,9.0134,2.5389,1.267,4.9564,0.0125,1.4874,1.1106,3.2519,11.6055,6.1751,3.2344,1.2119,4.1525,1.2803,1.4818,0.0002,2.3574,0.0941,0.0054,1.5583,0.8405,5.1709,0.0307,2.2923,3.838,5.3315,5.7302,10.4521,1.6557,7.3059,0.4245,3.942,0.1092,3.8005,5.8454,0.003,4.3568,2.8104,3.8905,2.5175,1.5545,0.3219,1.8323,5.1526,0.4006,1.5714,1.318,4.1698,1.3033,3.7085,3.5451,1.6383,2.925,5.0016,4.2658,0.2028,5.1224,0.2053,0.9691,1.1227,0.8256,0.4156,0.085,0.5253,0.9567,0.4193,3.5347,0.0751,4.7101,0.0239,0.2378,4.3583,1.7149,1.548,1.6151,3.3877,7.4608,4.1116,1.4235,1.0397,1.3405,2.5252,7.0266,2.3158,0.1759,3.1567,2.2226,7.2707,9.3079,4.467,0.1264,4.4871,0.1803,5.0863,0.1142,0.3006,0.77,0.0002,1.6962,10.5412,1.2421,2.0223,2.1049,2.7769,1.6114,1.0783,0.5422,5.7322,2.4282,5.4015,4.6859,5.1445,2.0832,2.1855,1.841,2.3521,1.4102,1.6379,6.0791,4.1289,2.7582,3.5079,1.942,8.065,0.6867,5.2926,3.9689,4.7385,0.3325,1.7369,0.0052,0.0357,2.4884,2.726,0.8228,1.8461,11.3494,3.8054,4.1165,3.4972,4.8041,6.1488,0.8099,3.3851,0.6144,1.5482,1.8024,3.3783,5.5018,9.3365,0.016,2.0982,4.838,0.7442,0.5369,3.6999,0.023,2.3073,4.049,0.9091,1.7496,0.0838,0.0906,2.031,2.4342,3.4022,2.9541,3.2993,1.6328,4.8091,1.9438,0.1817,3.3851,0.5595,0.6009,0.0181,0.1927,1.0332,4.7126,2.5837,0.4467]}

By December 1940 the 4 x 7 @ - @ 8 x 2 @ - @ mounts had been replaced by 4 x 11 @ - @ \/ 3 @ - @ mount also on each deck, which could also fire 12 x 37 @ - @ or 8 x 3 @ - @. As this proved sufficient to meet AA defenses in the Pacific, it was decided to remove the 3 x 6 @ - @ 6 x 9 @ - @ mounts which had been installed on most destroyers prior to 1939.\n\nAs well as the AA armament mounted on the aircraft carriers and destroyers, the fleet of coastal forces deployed 20 x 36 @ - @ \/2 x 21 @ 6 @ - @ \/1 x - @ \/11 @ - @ 8 x 1 x - @ mounts, the latter capable of firing both 12 x 37 @ - @ and 12 x 24 @ - @. They also had 50 x 22 @ 6 @ - @ \/2 x 21 @ 6 @ - @ \/1 x - @ \/11 @ - @ \/1 x - @ \/1 x - @ x - @ mounted on escort vessels ( which were now armed with 20 x 36 @ - @ \/2 x 21 @ 6 @ - @ \/1 x - @ \/11 @ - @ \/1 x - @ \/1 x - @ \/1 x - @ x - @ ), the latter also firing 12 x 37 @ - @ and 12 x 24 @ - @. The USN had also deployed four x 30 x 15 @ - @ mounts aboard coastal vessels, capable of firing a total of 36 @ - @ or 24 x 18 @ - @.","token_len":514,"entropy":[11.005,3.4102,17.3848,8.6944,13.8197,9.1614,4.8568,7.3485,4.6356,11.6966,2.0433,7.4995,0.4702,6.3952,0.0831,5.4406,6.6876,7.0383,1.5684,1.0756,6.17,3.0795,6.5327,0.092,6.3311,5.0572,0.6784,0.1192,6.0471,5.7125,4.0628,4.7944,3.9686,6.0681,4.7549,3.6957,0.4038,6.9715,6.3035,1.576,6.6883,5.4711,1.3134,7.7529,3.8031,6.2268,2.9767,1.693,4.3498,0.7985,3.7903,2.5035,1.8121,1.8068,3.6028,0.4977,0.2134,3.6213,4.5631,6.0858,4.6673,8.783,6.227,4.7261,0.832,1.9743,7.6597,3.1431,5.3818,3.2348,0.9499,0.7782,2.5027,0.7334,2.9935,0.3444,7.6199,8.251,2.2098,9.5001,5.4742,0.1908,6.6476,2.6869,8.2021,1.9399,1.2179,2.9518,3.0497,0.3171,1.2288,3.5079,1.0116,5.5571,0.0069,0.9914,6.091,0.2879,0.0701,1.346,0.7299,3.2975,3.368,1.6935,0.2194,6.3072,7.3278,5.7133,2.5528,2.1986,1.1905,0.2307,2.2754,1.6652,2.3997,0.1708,2.0655,2.4856,0.5523,4.2467,7.7983,6.9499,4.6029,6.1593,5.0476,4.9947,4.3113,1.4128,4.1588,6.6936,3.4735,1.9482,2.1658,2.5605,0.7142,5.7284,4.2475,6.5246,0.9541,1.7109,0.2132,10.3435,4.5744,7.0765,0.0105,1.8935,1.4408,2.8633,4.9434,1.3101,6.2495,0.9582,0.1643,1.8228,0.7917,0.1241,4.2442,0.8238,2.3796,0.5807,3.4245,0.1977,0.6845,0.7798,0.2574,0.0443,6.761,6.9936,2.7039,4.8843,0.2657,3.0821,1.7331,2.2148,2.0319,5.8071,0.1925,5.286,4.6076,4.2514,3.5572,14.3614,3.6744,4.7092,0.6696,3.2415,5.8349,1.8769,1.4196,3.4766,0.183,4.6408,0.3137,0.2849,0.1305,4.7754,2.0599,4.5593,0.322,0.6,0.0978,1.9205,1.4111,0.5398,1.0731,0.4445,1.7337,0.0196,5.6316,0.272,0.1017,0.1492,2.004,5.2878,2.1421,0.6141,0.1723,2.7673,9.1231,2.5079,2.7868,3.3702,1.629,4.0602,4.2347,3.595,5.9382,4.2671,0.6767,2.1004,0.4366,0.2719,0.1244,5.4293,3.0204,0.2162,2.285,0.2063,0.0662,0.044,2.7872,4.4061,4.4442,4.2389,7.342,1.6549,3.268,6.8038,6.8671,3.2061,1.1333,1.4989,0.3762,3.5524,0.5953,2.5774,0.7278,4.8625,0.533,3.9035,0.2462,3.2852,0.1738,0.1658,0.1797,4.2135,0.6576,4.7613,0.5339,0.2661,0.1028,1.438,5.8174,1.9112,0.7616,2.8339,1.5136,5.5979,0.6067,0.0012,4.6714,0.0119,3.2627,0.3327,1.1089,0.0002,3.4393,4.7044,0.0407,1.2743,4.9192,3.898,0.0733,8.2441,0.3325,2.0089,4.94,1.0569,3.6914,2.8178,0.0009,0.2813,0.7834,6.7555,2.3835,8.357,7.0648,4.9394,6.1374,0.7348,4.5032,0.6042,0.3016,0.1679,3.5887,1.9853,0.4153,5.4092,0.3322,7.4295,1.8509,0.6096,0.1109,2.1744,1.6821,0.1043,1.1539,0.0495,3.0799,5.7399,1.5339,1.1121,0.162,4.8064,0.6078,2.6081,2.214,1.2098,0.0635,2.1164,2.0874,4.2815,2.5948,6.419,0.0194,0.9541,4.7306,1.8359,0.2639,1.1233,0.132,0.0751,0.0434,2.1173,2.3713,0.0064,4.6069,0.0779,0.2023,0.0413,2.8436,5.4337,1.1421,0.9349,7.1848,0.8173,4.15,0.1442,5.6746,0.7828,0.7241,0.0461,1.5836,1.6164,0.0938,2.1712,0.0531,1.1746,0.4502,0.2875,0.0231,0.387,0.6856,0.0243,0.0648,0.0082,0.2019,0.7904,0.0505,0.166,0.011,2.3793,2.1896,0.0497,0.1958,0.0137,0.6255,1.7331,0.0666,0.1641,0.0155,5.1894,2.0952,0.2042,6.47,1.4398,7.0429,2.7825,3.3004,7.1054,1.4197,4.5333,5.4426,0.2927,3.9766,0.2305,1.722,0.151,0.2157,0.0153,0.4444,0.356,0.0307,0.3035,0.0413,0.2755,0.1513,0.0643,0.0168,0.1029,0.4155,0.0115,0.0357,0.0084,0.0766,0.4588,0.0119,0.0415,0.0086,0.1804,0.3631,0.009,0.0065,0.0085,0.4353,0.3828,0.0141,0.0181,0.0094,0.583,0.4242,0.0378,0.0404,0.0149,2.2476,0.3949,0.1038,6.7106,3.1317,0.5545,4.0292,4.0265,1.6394,0.0542,0.885,0.0071,0.0385,0.0093,1.4326,0.1398,0.0035,0.3137,0.0031,0.0821,0.0049,0.6526,2.1461,3.0486,0.0766,2.3281,2.6607,3.3759,4.3589,1.5455,4.4094,4.6407,4.1631,0.0705,0.7179,0.0443,3.0244,6.3688,5.927,3.3052,1.0843,4.9826,0.0145,0.4014,4.8159,2.5082,0.0211,4.4075,2.497,0.0839,0.0192,3.2893,2.4145,0.3405,3.807,0.0228,0.4987,0.0178,1.8461]}
{"id":2306,"ended":true,"length":430,"text":"Keswick's recorded history starts in the Middle Ages. The area was conquered by the Anglo @ - @ Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria in the seventh century, but Northumbria was destroyed by the powerful Danish King, Sweyn Estridsson, in the year 941. The Kingdom of Northumbria was later ruled by a succession of Danish kings, beginning with the brothers Alfred and Edward the \"Apostle\" ( 871-924 & 927-935 ), the ancestors of the later Kings of England, Alfred, Edward the Confessor ( 871-901 ) & Edward the \"Younger \" ( 904 - 966 ) and then by the Germanic King of Wessex ( 897-899 ), who had the royal name Alfred. In 987, King Edmund I was defeated by Sweingr Estridsson and the Kingdom of Mercia was absorbed into the Danish kingdom of Wessex.\n\nWessex was ruled by King John, the last Danish King of Wessex ( 986 - ) and his wife, Ethelred the Unready ( 979 - ) who was the King of England for a few days after his father died ( 1016 ) but was unable to retain the throne. Wessex was later overrun by Vikings ( 1016 - ). The kingdom was then governed by many Danish kings, including Aethelred the Unready ( 1009 - 1035 ) who was crowned King of England in 1017 and was one of the most powerful Kings who ever lived. King \u00c6thelred of Wessex ( 1009 - 1035 ) had at least 30 sons and 15 daughters and had a reputation for having the largest harem in England. In 1035 King \u00c6thelred and his wife, Erlendr ( 1008 - 1043 ) were murdered by their own men. The land was united under a new King Harold in the same year.\n\nIn the early 1200's Earl Hakon, of Norway, married his wife, Emma of Denmark, to a son of King Harold and received the lands of Mercia in return. Earl Hakon later killed his daughter in law, Emma, to take revenge for the murder of his wife during childbirth.

One of the most notable tanks that had to be modernized was the Leopard 2, which is one of the most effective front-line tanks at the moment.\n\nLeopard 2A6 A1 ( Spanish Army)\n\nAccording to our sources, Spain was among the countries that had ordered the first batch of Leopard 2A4 tanks, which started to be assembled at the Spanish plant of MBDA in Soria \/ Spain in late 2010. However, in 2011, it was suspected that the Spanish army had placed an order for a much more modern tank : the Leclerc. Our sources reported that the Spanish Army was actually in talks with French manufacturer Nexter Group, which would receive a Spanish order for at least 25 Leclerc tanks. Nexter is currently being considered as one of the finalists of the multi-billion Leclerc tank order.\n\nThe most powerful tank in the world, the Leclerc tank could potentially replace the Leopard 2s in the Spanish Army.

Many of the Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross.\n\nThe following day, 28th of April, British troops were able to break out of the positions and push the German Empire back. The ANZACS under Birdwood were sent in to clear the lines of the Australian and New Zealand troops, who had held the trench line through relentless bombardments.\n\nMany of the Australians were again killed or captured and the ANZACs were pushed back once more. The Germans were pushed further back and were driven out of the Somme in late September.\n\nThe Battle of the Somme was the largest battle of the war ; approximately 90000 British and allied troops, died in just six weeks of fighting.\n\nAs with other campaigns in the war, this battle was marked by the actions of soldiers on both sides displaying great bravery and determination.","token_len":514,"entropy":[9.6977,9.1194,7.2054,5.8068,6.3812,6.1042,10.8793,6.4204,2.0808,5.2362,3.3721,13.0679,6.4198,5.6611,2.4532,0.0308,2.8631,4.7968,3.4107,10.0655,1.1238,1.3319,2.1699,8.5377,2.0429,2.8428,5.7534,2.2951,4.8889,4.7314,0.0442,1.8621,0.8279,3.0378,0.0258,4.4387,0.7487,4.8152,1.9932,6.5291,3.0808,4.3217,2.6419,2.7589,0.0395,2.79,3.0505,0.0259,0.8876,2.4748,1.9193,3.6637,1.4797,2.0863,4.3327,0.8768,3.6408,0.9652,3.8187,6.5768,1.7911,4.4254,0.3658,2.303,4.609,2.8883,0.8981,0.3788,4.5668,1.3227,3.3096,2.6617,0.0051,6.8138,6.0676,1.7945,2.3409,0.0723,3.2799,3.61,0.0076,0.8195,7.3625,2.4711,0.1457,0.6384,3.125,2.7525,12.9731,1.2109,0.8402,4.2932,5.6976,4.9819,2.6766,6.5778,1.8298,3.459,0.86,0.0272,0.6221,2.7382,0.0002,3.25,3.6803,0.4944,2.4959,1.6888,2.2886,3.7409,6.6777,4.2052,5.863,3.9407,2.4127,7.8382,0.3594,2.7082,8.7602,1.8903,4.4451,3.2384,5.1821,7.4242,7.2021,3.3024,4.1033,5.2878,2.8301,0.892,1.2754,0.0002,5.9699,0.2913,2.1841,3.4069,0.1788,0.1977,1.3799,4.3539,1.9421,0.1648,0.0163,7.3636,2.4014,0.0212,0.0038,0.2229,3.4405,5.197,0.433,4.3326,1.7002,6.3509,1.4115,5.8052,1.9956,3.8816,3.6182,4.7618,0.0609,0.0105,0.2146,0.9055,0.0002,1.8881,4.5911,5.2127,0.1858,2.3059,5.9202,4.7557,5.0111,3.5572,3.12,5.6815,4.1671,4.6056,1.3156,4.7605,0.8564,0.1479,2.4968,1.6732,4.7061,3.2533,0.2741,0.803,4.918,5.4599,1.375,4.657,1.5414,11.0003,1.5218,3.8732,0.0164,5.7537,3.3601,2.3716,3.1988,5.7382,2.0628,4.4041,0.9275,0.3183,1.3927,0.0049,0.872,0.0277,1.6824,9.9087,2.0988,1.439,6.3199,0.7409,1.6337,2.6396,1.1428,0.7499,2.6052,5.407,0.957,1.5783,2.6417,4.6759,0.9269,3.2019,1.8479,1.2064,2.2006,2.9336,5.806,7.0355,2.4141,7.1908,0.6828,3.2658,3.618,5.2734,4.4588,0.796,1.5752,4.7646,4.4053,3.3762,2.7888,1.105,0.5116,3.3674,0.0076,0.0059,10.0701,1.1964,0.5373,0.0002,1.664,3.3317,1.4867,0.1154,0.0086,1.6526,0.0806,0.0055,0.0018,0.0942,1.1469,1.7433,5.5958,5.1788,1.9699,2.2505,4.0193,0.9544,0.0019,1.4205,1.9778,4.5695,3.9993,3.3553,1.3013,6.1698,7.0483,6.8193,1.6648,5.3815,1.1632,3.1725,0.0045,0.0027,0.856,0.1151,3.1831,1.8989,1.0728,0.8974,0.7828,0.0002,1.6139,3.0405,0.0026,0.0033,0.9131,4.6278,4.1393,4.8218,4.1805,3.9617,0.6359,5.6069,2.0138,1.9709,3.1501,1.3233,0.0097,3.6888,0.8947,5.0914,4.3834,1.0224,5.6562,1.7881,2.0795,3.8709,7.2712,1.5298,4.9374,7.8172,6.4538,4.6208,1.682,2.9492,1.4726,7.0508,0.0081,0.0031,8.8747,6.4708,1.6374,0.5782,6.582,1.2742,0.4917,2.5145,1.2074,5.8333,1.493,3.5543,0.1288,1.3638,0.3667,0.0002,1.4815,4.4375,0.4892,2.1541,7.126,0.5832,0.4894,0.3015,0.6384,3.4133,1.311,1.8799,2.4633,0.0102,2.4729,4.3409,0.4957,0.5812,4.2925,2.3803,5.1214,1.5936,1.8482,9.0526,0.47,2.0156,1.5806,1.9497,0.002,0.0039,0.3719,6.4875,10.568,0.1327,1.9871,6.1682,4.1306,1.4187,4.646,0.7093,4.9664,1.4982,0.9491,2.9744,1.2544,0.1119,0.0154,2.2011,1.7214,4.5567,2.1971,4.7162,1.9852,6.9997,4.7234,4.9347,10.4145,5.4549,0.021,0.882,0.6491,0.0002,6.1761,0.8308,0.142,1.7415,0.8893,7.6365,4.2303,1.807,1.5287,2.8514,1.7561,1.3349,0.0012,0.0014,3.1999,1.0387,5.1994,0.1798,5.4682,0.4553,0.5953,1.9015,3.7478,1.7295,5.3957,4.2445,0.2818,1.5109,2.5401,4.2709,2.0789,0.7544,0.6045,6.7456,0.007,3.8409,4.102,4.8403,1.2279,0.5518,0.0002,1.307,3.1435,0.1795,1.7924,0.3107,0.0018,2.3038,1.8538,3.7567,0.9826,0.6648,0.3314,0.7397,9.4821,7.9335,4.665,6.4691,1.9054,1.8974,4.7655,0.6321,3.1434,7.4401,1.6676,6.942,5.4142,2.6469,1.8518,0.6727,0.4983,0.7322,0.0004,4.6026,3.9088,3.548,4.8671,1.4875,0.9117,1.7723,0.5748,3.165,2.2037,1.1296,4.516,0.2954,2.9878,6.6372,0.1472,5.5712,3.2858,0.3795,0.0128,9.9164,3.0989,0.7988,0.8991,3.2364,0.3448]}
{"id":2597,"ended":false,"length":412,"text":"In 1907, Spokane's board of park commissioners retained the services of the Olmsted Brothers to draw up a plan for Spokane's parks. Much of Spokane's park land was acquired by the city from the Spokane Tribe between 1879 and 1904. During much of that time, native peoples were prohibited by the U.S. government from building their cabins out of the materials they needed to construct those cabins (wood), for those cabins. The Spokane Tribe was not forced to leave the land for non-native settlers, and, in fact, held onto a large portion of land, but because the U.S. government had determined that Native Americans were only nomads who only held onto the land by the threat of force, that land had to be opened up. Once native peoples were on the land to settle, they could not make their cabins out of wood unless they purchased wood from outside the area. Thus much land acquired from the Spokane Tribe had to be cleared for non-natives.\n\nOnce the Spokane Tribe lost that land, the city of Spokane had bought all of that land and was given a large amount of land from the U.S. government (see below). As mentioned above, the Olmsted Brothers, who were contracted by the city to draw up a plan for the parks, went ahead and created many of the designs for the parks that would be built after 1910, when the city took over the park departments. Olmsted Brothers'designs included such things as:\n\nPlanned roads\n\nPlanned picnic grounds\n\nFlower beds\n\nTennis Courts\n\nBasketball courts\n\nHorse-pulls (as opposed to the Native American style in which the horses walked the trails)\n\nShooting ranges\n\nHorse-polkalynx arenas\n\nThe following are actual designs from Olmsted Brothers from 1907 :\n\nPlanned Roads - Spokane Public Park, 1907\n\nPlanned Picnics Grounds - Spokane Public Park, 1907\n\nPlanned Tennis Courts - Spokane Public Park, 1907\n\nFlower beds - Spokane Public Park, 1907\n\nBasketball Courts - Spokane Public Park, 1907\n\nHorse-Polkalynx Arena - Spokane Public Park, 1907\n\nBelow are the actual designs that were chosen and built as follows :\n\nSpokane Municipal Park, 1908 - 1912\n\n(not all of the original Olmsted designs were picked to build, which is why the designs above were changed)","token_len":514,"entropy":[12.2854,0.3008,11.1005,2.6088,6.9239,0.2775,10.7185,1.2026,8.7946,1.3457,5.5508,0.0247,1.3612,8.4207,0.8666,0.0938,4.856,1.7246,5.829,0.8946,0.9015,1.3051,0.587,5.4506,0.326,2.9795,0.7906,7.5787,0.3787,5.1123,0.0866,2.7663,3.666,0.7894,4.0792,0.9695,0.4938,2.7546,3.3672,0.4923,5.7039,8.1393,6.6192,2.5703,3.8469,0.0832,3.8972,0.6052,4.6295,7.7475,0.0188,1.9376,0.2531,0.1747,7.7037,2.5114,2.5118,6.1629,4.7644,0.9619,3.6128,0.0101,0.0015,0.0016,1.3424,0.1183,3.5349,2.914,11.4728,0.1199,6.1232,0.393,1.309,9.3384,1.4358,2.5644,1.0402,2.9981,5.2823,1.1907,0.0006,5.494,7.1887,6.4937,5.5779,6.2376,1.9693,0.0005,6.7317,1.7809,4.2528,2.706,2.5415,2.8329,5.0682,0.147,4.5344,1.3207,1.9725,2.4544,5.6321,0.376,1.3213,5.3204,1.3949,1.7872,4.3463,1.7691,1.5649,0.0066,7.606,4.8849,3.3337,2.3773,0.4413,0.0399,4.2781,3.8137,3.5839,6.2517,1.5496,3.1785,0.0005,0.0006,0.0006,0.2478,2.141,5.1604,0.4304,3.0609,0.9714,1.28,4.9536,6.5114,2.1708,3.1256,7.3453,6.2313,3.2622,1.4571,0.7565,5.4288,2.8547,7.1292,0.0341,4.3378,0.3398,4.3768,2.3949,2.8518,0.6066,0.0802,7.1477,0.8705,2.0719,5.6034,6.6907,1.0318,1.1679,5.7795,0.5228,0.3861,4.8239,5.0648,0.5395,1.0054,1.8041,2.0505,5.2008,1.972,5.6707,0.0005,1.3153,0.1421,1.5868,4.7297,0.45,4.5371,5.0589,1.1929,4.5417,0.5957,2.8055,0.613,4.008,7.2056,2.1167,7.1461,1.7478,0.8747,3.4258,0.9787,2.7025,0.426,0.0724,3.5857,2.0405,3.1545,0.0167,6.7811,0.1443,1.2327,1.6169,0.0136,5.1817,0.9249,3.6663,1.2561,5.9581,3.9878,0.3804,0.2922,1.3531,2.5895,2.081,0.0214,3.2894,8.4641,3.6521,0.8799,3.2757,0.3549,2.2617,5.0574,4.7957,1.7696,2.926,2.6663,0.0459,0.9821,3.729,0.3753,2.4705,0.0006,0.0005,0.0041,0.2147,3.9366,3.6344,2.7119,0.2827,3.7795,5.2806,1.0323,0.0215,0.8235,3.3849,0.0056,0.0084,0.2567,3.2761,1.5935,1.783,6.9306,1.1921,0.1302,0.6336,0.4249,3.1353,0.0544,1.1677,0.3084,0.4343,1.2856,2.9928,0.2585,6.0325,3.0341,0.2919,4.0088,5.4524,1.5024,0.3991,5.3352,1.3034,0.6476,2.0946,2.6855,3.2227,1.5563,1.3976,4.4829,3.4409,2.5126,3.951,0.602,1.3317,3.976,0.4816,0.8527,2.926,8.8765,0.7587,6.3107,0.0041,0.0027,1.1992,11.3774,11.0903,7.8932,2.0222,3.0677,5.6536,2.5612,0.0042,2.8004,0.6821,0.0002,5.2548,2.9047,5.3983,2.5846,0.0001,2.4396,0.1034,6.2865,4.8341,0.2558,0.0002,5.8107,3.0811,4.7514,0.3881,0.0003,4.1903,6.7801,4.666,0.2479,0.0003,4.4221,2.0407,0.304,0.1964,0.0003,3.8014,2.455,3.3233,7.7422,6.0215,3.7202,4.92,2.8412,0.0016,2.8631,7.2582,0.7132,2.9756,5.0881,1.312,1.6907,4.6094,6.6546,3.9337,4.3061,1.0616,0.0316,0.0003,4.9573,2.9573,2.3166,0.3966,0.0003,3.5206,0.9833,1.1473,3.7567,11.9187,9.5878,7.0586,6.2654,7.3664,0.3602,0.0004,3.6413,4.8687,2.2324,7.3227,3.0827,3.0404,2.4789,0.0045,0.0021,0.116,7.5628,1.8043,8.1243,0.1851,0.0004,4.2379,0.0875,4.7649,4.1879,5.0444,7.0072,3.8701,2.5521,3.1691,0.8268,0.0002,1.3072,0.0055,3.1128,2.0363,0.1671,9.9441,0.1035,1.0189,0.1893,0.0367,0.1111,0.4831,0.0639,0.0002,0.5009,0.0063,2.9844,0.081,0.1057,0.1947,0.0347,0.0106,0.0366,0.1427,0.05,0.0002,5.4395,0.4436,1.648,0.1913,0.4453,0.0546,0.0114,0.0939,0.1152,0.0618,0.0002,2.9506,0.019,0.7993,0.0315,0.049,0.0032,0.0088,0.0078,0.0207,0.0457,0.0002,1.1252,0.0233,0.1125,13.2466,2.0843,0.5838,0.0058,0.0156,2.1871,0.1721,0.1137,0.0376,0.0154,0.0323,0.1112,0.0611,0.0002,9.13,0.8275,2.2494,2.3086,1.406,2.7668,0.7928,5.0447,3.2723,2.1052,4.4818,4.7189,0.7049,0.1217,0.0003,5.8787,0.0002,5.5644,1.7178,1.9127,1.877,2.2512,3.6302,0.3997,0.0002,5.0245,6.1513,3.7294,0.7721,0.8627,2.9252,3.8204,0.0028,0.0022,5.3021,0.6674,6.245,4.6841,2.2922,5.519,4.6941,1.9107,0.7714,1.8338,4.0314,3.4593,1.7295,5.6726,2.89]}

Busan was forecast to get another 12 cm ( 4 inches ) of rain on Friday.[25]\n\nOn September 8, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) predicted Typhoon Lionrock to make landfall along South Manchuria, but later downgraded it to a tropical storm. However, due to the effects of Typhoon Nari, there were fears that it was a more significant danger. The International Hurricane Association (IHA) warned that parts of northern Japan were \"at serious risk of hurricane conditions\", with heavy rain due to the typhoon, strong winds and high tides.[8]\n\nLionrock made landfall along the coast of northeastern Manchuria on September 16 at 0300 UTC (09:00 P.M. September 15). With a peak intensity of 100 km\/h and a minimum barometric pressure of 993 hPa, it was the third-strongest typhoon reported in the basin behind Typhoon Roke (2004), which struck Busan in October 2002, and Typhoon Songmi (2008), although at the minimum intensity it was equivalent to a super typhoon.[26] Around this time it was downgraded to a tropical storm.\n\nDespite the downgrade, the JMA had expressed caution about the storm's potential to cause a record storm surge. With the peak tide happening in early morning, Lionrock reached a maximum tide of 8.56 metres (29 ft) in the Busan area, although it later passed through the Sea of Japan and gradually weakened until it dissipated over Japan.[27] Its waves and strong winds caused widespread damage. One death of a fisherman was reported in Jeju Island. According to a study by South Korea, over 700,000 homes suffered severe damage, with economic losses up to 1.1 trillion Korean won (US$1.2 billion), most of it in the Seoul metropolitan area.[28]\n\nDue to the damage caused in China and South Korea, as well as the heavy rainfall and flooding in Japan, Lions rock caused significant economic losses at the start of autumn, including in Australia,[29] New Zealand,[30] and Taiwan.[31]","token_len":514,"entropy":[7.9075,1.3733,0.3744,8.8753,3.8009,2.5238,7.3956,6.8957,7.283,3.2754,9.3255,4.0433,0.15,0.1366,2.5792,5.3546,4.5204,4.2195,0.9953,7.0999,3.2928,0.8462,4.4866,0.0127,2.2471,1.5209,3.1225,9.3543,0.0108,5.1631,2.9328,4.0233,0.0597,0.2998,2.2496,0.3724,0.0303,4.565,1.8984,1.8634,0.3656,0.4181,5.7834,0.7069,3.7121,0.7115,5.0515,0.0034,0.6039,4.384,7.74,2.6503,0.6915,0.0062,1.0256,1.4359,3.39,5.3019,4.5128,3.4479,1.2772,6.5325,1.4908,3.2241,1.4972,0.005,0.4124,2.9006,4.114,3.6856,0.6043,0.5055,1.6395,3.2261,2.6178,3.8689,0.4821,2.3406,4.6035,0.0842,1.8928,5.8469,0.0036,2.4021,4.1066,0.0574,5.5922,3.7085,4.3151,3.2234,0.2839,2.2392,0.2883,0.0197,0.6997,0.0962,1.7449,2.7216,9.5679,4.6509,0.0528,0.6023,0.0005,2.8919,1.1041,3.3844,0.0919,1.797,5.6608,0.0496,0.0012,0.0398,1.5302,0.0997,0.3347,0.0612,3.7732,5.5269,10.2245,10.6146,1.6858,2.742,0.0749,4.1236,3.2461,12.5326,0.0926,0.0058,1.6179,4.4393,4.626,4.6635,0.1905,2.2537,0.3117,1.1158,1.1936,0.6001,1.3149,3.8708,0.0348,4.148,0.0064,1.2712,6.9291,0.023,1.5351,5.3488,5.1902,0.9311,4.3638,1.6772,5.6952,0.6494,2.562,3.7303,3.2677,3.4204,4.6726,7.053,1.8886,2.1119,6.3771,5.4231,8.5269,0.6211,0.9006,1.1663,0.1286,2.5093,0.75,8.1951,0.005,4.3586,0.8349,1.6543,3.2008,4.177,6.2744,0.0198,1.1446,4.4617,5.1514,2.8003,2.3265,4.0783,1.4375,4.3199,0.1489,1.3812,3.4367,0.0225,3.2207,6.0001,0.2194,1.1017,2.6499,2.8914,2.1704,8.2909,0.1196,0.7105,0.0001,6.1372,0.158,0.1664,3.5167,0.1143,3.0542,0.9335,2.0212,0.1641,4.3943,4.2565,0.0065,0.0031,0.6629,0.3432,3.1888,5.0089,4.0757,3.8374,2.6294,1.2465,4.5323,2.0549,0.6117,4.2144,0.0414,0.006,0.76,9.3043,3.1902,1.1133,5.4499,2.1454,4.5341,3.5782,0.124,4.3754,2.8047,1.0606,0.0249,4.0419,0.96,2.5472,8.0798,0.3269,0.0648,0.1701,4.3409,5.7398,7.7246,0.0792,0.8139,1.2113,1.2076,1.0437,3.0662,2.3972,3.231,0.0006,0.5328,0.0017,7.1812,1.1412,1.0448,7.3959,7.165,1.25,5.1733,7.7389,1.9564,5.3738,1.27,1.3034,3.8927,9.1016,0.0121,1.5459,3.3355,3.3559,1.7156,0.1948,0.6067,6.7837,7.8782,0.3597,2.8005,1.9455,8.4904,5.9329,2.0583,8.5542,3.9735,2.2565,0.5919,6.144,0.0494,1.8727,6.8172,0.0755,0.0031,1.2396,1.4906,0.0742,7.594,4.9145,0.0704,3.8821,1.0832,6.5481,0.0458,0.2986,0.3531,0.1718,0.1062,2.2255,0.886,0.0001,5.5876,1.1303,8.6369,0.3865,1.5461,4.6107,0.0349,3.8447,5.5056,6.0704,1.5671,1.0195,4.8665,0.7242,1.4524,1.6551,1.8832,3.2622,5.6327,4.7323,0.1387,1.6569,4.9739,1.8359,4.7867,4.5793,9.2856,2.2719,2.7483,3.338,1.0762,6.9519,0.0132,5.0735,2.3076,0.7063,3.6308,0.2669,3.291,2.3633,5.6095,3.514,0.5307,4.211,1.7177,1.2113,2.1192,1.2082,9.816,0.0034,1.3823,1.3107,4.9608,1.4181,5.0269,4.9606,1.6847,1.0208,5.7928,0.0602,0.0579,1.882,5.9647,4.7758,5.4702,0.5878,7.7796,0.0034,4.0977,3.3005,2.3803,0.5461,0.0536,5.5017,7.5994,4.3755,4.103,0.4763,2.2234,3.7275,1.7112,3.0644,5.2009,5.9909,5.4839,0.8333,3.6714,1.3837,0.459,1.1353,6.8846,0.0037,0.1337,2.282,4.6794,0.0012,2.8759,6.3626,1.2174,5.3517,0.9674,4.9203,4.6752,5.3136,1.9974,0.0026,4.8956,4.0334,3.8614,0.2414,1.917,1.6305,9.0069,0.6582,3.8291,0.2819,3.3898,0.4918,2.9187,2.4233,5.5038,0.2682,1.5355,1.1943,0.1224,2.4086,0.2766,2.6875,0.3068,2.3624,5.3629,0.1756,1.7837,1.2817,1.4775,6.6386,1.7253,0.0459,0.4544,0.1032,0.039,0.6946,0.0001,5.17,0.0094,0.8778,4.6803,0.9274,4.495,6.7438,1.6373,2.0073,0.0135,0.2452,5.6626,0.1607,0.0048,0.9754,4.3928,1.6098,3.4163,2.2413,1.7213,1.7946,0.2365,6.0843,10.5163,4.8811,3.6874,5.3947,1.0863,5.001,0.9862,4.0792,0.0287,7.5206,1.8201,4.0754,3.9313,8.2753,4.243,0.1351,0.0829,3.8378,0.0325,1.1872,0.023,0.0698,1.467,4.0023,0.2647,0.1721,0.0474]}

With the construction of new stations such as Kengsington and Croydon in 1936, the Board was able to extend the drinking water mains more than 7,500 km in the first half of 1933.\n\nDuring this period, the Board also built a new type of reservoir, also known as an open reservoir or open tank, to store water for domestic or drinking purposes. The open tanks were mainly constructed to cover the shortage of storage capacity, particularly in drought-prone areas; the first of this type was completed at Whitchurch in 1920.\n\nIn addition to this, an estimated 400 mains were rebuilt or extended during this period to facilitate the improvement of water supply and distribution. While the majority of open tanks built by the Board could be covered only with an earth covering and not with a concrete slab, at least 50 of them were provided with concrete slabs.\n\nThe increase in volume of drinking water delivered by the BSWB improved the average household's water intake from 30 m3 per annum in 1921 to 140 m3 in 1939. At this stage, the Board's total annual water output had increased to about 13.6 billion m3, with total annual consumption of 16.1 billion m3.\n\nMost of the work on the board's water supply infrastructure between 1920 and 1950 took place in the central West and Central West in the south. In the West, three of the board's eleven pumping stations were built during this period.\n\nTwo pumping stations were added in the Central West, and three were added in the east. Although the BSWB increased its pumping capacity during this period, the increase in demand increased the load on the water system which sometimes resulted in pressure and distribution problems.","token_len":514,"entropy":[9.1943,7.6379,6.8885,6.0157,10.57,9.5506,9.2446,3.4569,0.3159,6.6349,2.0099,0.8886,10.1163,1.9134,3.2907,1.2341,3.3867,0.098,1.8235,4.2548,1.8573,12.0981,9.2465,5.1294,3.5587,4.0579,3.1815,1.8208,4.9216,4.1459,3.9908,5.6195,6.9585,5.4565,5.6175,6.2177,4.722,1.7562,0.3882,5.5061,4.8189,1.2765,6.0016,4.6843,6.1045,0.0673,3.0338,0.2589,1.1652,0.002,2.6072,1.7811,2.7278,5.0862,0.0162,0.6088,1.442,3.8092,4.0459,3.4415,3.0246,0.0443,3.8207,6.7142,4.5006,1.339,2.7236,1.4653,1.7419,0.6462,3.4505,10.2333,0.0547,3.433,0.0227,2.0953,4.5655,1.1762,0.0064,3.0376,6.5791,0.695,5.3861,0.0095,0.8737,3.8196,5.2497,1.6715,5.3122,5.7591,1.9964,2.6481,5.3111,3.2859,5.6608,4.5779,7.4922,0.0566,3.3389,2.7977,6.6698,0.8768,0.3134,6.9828,2.5767,1.7462,5.616,2.1888,1.7035,3.826,4.2027,0.3416,3.6115,6.5943,0.0288,0.8952,0.3827,4.2087,2.2054,0.0635,4.0443,0.0827,0.0234,0.7774,0.2619,0.0946,0.3738,0.3061,1.0826,0.0002,1.634,7.9048,2.5555,1.6476,3.4958,1.1524,4.9407,2.9796,6.2108,3.6116,1.9099,0.6801,2.5929,1.3353,3.2529,3.9509,6.6522,2.9081,5.1883,0.0738,1.127,4.8682,0.2121,4.529,1.4808,2.0527,3.1672,1.7057,3.7455,2.3766,3.2596,5.4397,0.9856,3.0622,0.0503,4.1927,3.3966,5.6847,0.0051,3.8232,6.1587,5.2812,10.0326,1.4654,5.0597,3.8248,0.1548,2.2418,4.9842,0.2801,0.7695,3.7559,2.6749,0.2804,0.0065,3.6748,0.6649,7.6258,0.1299,8.3287,0.0026,6.8188,1.5357,5.1709,0.7652,2.2646,0.2466,2.9609,1.6055,3.3166,2.0615,0.006,7.0565,0.8725,0.7713,0.0002,4.1942,2.716,0.5803,0.4487,0.7564,1.8008,2.6289,2.8542,1.7522,1.9685,6.9451,0.03,5.8208,2.0379,6.4008,0.923,0.0136,3.0175,4.9291,3.3239,4.0077,3.5206,4.1886,0.442,1.9884,4.3214,0.9669,1.851,6.6424,5.4333,7.4246,0.6538,0.387,1.4256,1.8755,3.7868,1.0491,5.7224,3.7336,1.6608,6.1247,1.0122,9.085,0.1481,6.7644,2.4462,2.1218,5.5924,1.1872,6.1988,0.7476,1.3143,0.4227,4.4438,1.7445,4.7351,2.9948,3.3486,0.5749,0.8,3.0917,3.9785,8.1866,4.5569,0.0118,0.4244,5.5563,0.8705,0.6049,0.0002,1.8731,3.0781,0.472,3.953,0.878,5.027,5.1611,4.4339,3.6758,0.2619,0.8723,7.6524,5.1967,3.5385,3.5331,2.4962,0.1069,2.2139,5.9135,1.4281,5.508,0.1237,1.8759,2.0288,2.3718,3.4151,1.1737,6.2089,1.1644,5.9979,0.0398,7.3174,1.1354,5.8179,3.7682,0.0793,0.3694,5.3534,0.7306,6.0246,4.3941,1.3092,4.2595,6.2994,6.7066,3.7483,3.9133,1.517,1.6763,2.6809,2.9927,0.263,5.1802,1.2001,3.8054,3.3578,1.785,0.6538,4.9593,0.1405,2.3386,3.1582,0.0566,1.397,1.0754,0.0002,1.4648,7.1877,0.0954,6.3212,0.5076,2.4294,0.0185,6.2558,0.8553,0.4759,4.9623,6.687,4.9761,5.6527,0.9864,5.9087,3.7474,0.472,1.1315,3.3664,2.3898,5.1409,3.0066,6.1099,1.6697,4.1026,0.0004,1.6875,5.1986,0.4594,6.3474,0.0447,0.0194,1.7142,4.3448,0.842,3.8966,2.3515,4.2859,0.5253,1.0662,1.7118,3.1622,4.063,3.8505,1.1674,4.4724,3.3865,1.3312,1.1778,3.3777,5.3438,1.3853,2.269,2.8057,3.0326,3.1503,1.764,2.7368,4.8109,2.0547,1.5642,1.6817,4.7625,0.2578,2.5168,0.0762,0.1131,0.0179,0.646,0.7055,0.0002,6.7923,0.6573,0.1982,6.3606,1.9343,0.4171,4.4502,1.1353,2.5002,2.5609,5.1879,6.0234,3.1229,0.0397,4.6786,4.4542,0.0127,0.8118,1.1515,4.1436,6.8714,3.2863,3.796,2.6338,4.5096,0.7874,2.0318,1.0299,2.3878,1.0797,3.7813,0.4421,6.6307,2.8781,0.0799,3.612,0.019,6.2286,4.7201,0.0482,0.6818,2.329,3.4453,0.6323,0.1397,1.2913,1.6614,0.0002,5.9474,4.7606,0.0874,0.72,3.9545,1.7702,0.9941,3.9863,0.201,2.1858,2.6868,3.2254,2.5814,2.2541,0.518,0.0916,3.9319,0.5829,5.6108,0.751,3.9021,0.0359,0.0047,5.5948,1.0849,2.7782,0.2351,2.2643,0.7201,0.0844,0.4746,1.2394,4.2104,0.5713,3.8815,4.8962,1.4925,6.1513,1.1161,0.4686,3.6537,1.8228,4.7929,7.49,2.0089,0.0106,6.559,4.0022,6.0798,0.8332,0.4309]}

Unfortunately, due to mounting competition, the Trident ended up being very underpowered and Allingham was forced into early retirement from his post.\n\nAlthough Allingham only put his name to one submarine, if you had asked him which craft he was most proud of, it was a safe bet he would have said the Trident. Unfortunately for Allingham, his submarine was unsuccessful at its intended function. The Trident was a very small submarine which was limited to a depth of 5500 feet (1700 meters). Because of this, the submarine was required to carry very few payloads in comparison to modern nuclear submarines.\n\nAlthough he never took credit for the design, or had first-hand experience, Allingham did have some hand in the creation of the submarine.\n\nAt one point, Allingham was the chairman of the board for Rolls-Royce which manufactured the nuclear reactor that would power the submarine.\n\nIn 1974, the Trident was completed and sent to its final home of Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base in Georgia, USA. Allingham was also responsible for the firing demonstration at this time which featured firing the Trident underwater. Unfortunately for Allingham, the firing demonstration was a failure and the test ended in a detonation.\n\nFollowing the failed demonstration, Allingham was removed from this position at Rolls-Royce and he was made redundant. Despite the embarrassing incident, Allingham remained proud of his submarine and he insisted he never would have approved the demonstration had he known.\n\n\u201cIt was never the intention to use it to test a weapon, just to demonstrate its operational capabilities. The idea is that an independent observer could confirm that it performed in the same way which it was intended for use in a real operation during war time.\u201d\n\nAfter retiring from Rolls-Royce, Allingham took a job as an engineer for Thorns Vickers Armstrong. This eventually led to his work on the British submarine. He passed away aged 85 on 22nd February 2007 at a nursing home in Taunton.","token_len":514,"entropy":[7.6823,0.9728,3.7474,5.9414,0.8529,4.2252,0.7205,5.6694,0.5185,8.4753,6.5266,3.7666,3.955,6.5584,0.0098,0.0015,0.0222,4.2934,0.419,1.886,1.6741,2.894,1.1926,2.6595,7.2013,1.5125,8.5936,5.013,7.8561,8.6509,7.8076,1.2894,0.5602,6.5531,3.013,6.0121,1.7591,1.3136,5.1208,0.8224,9.5936,2.254,10.2864,0.8414,0.0003,0.1013,2.2408,5.6677,1.287,3.4662,4.9415,2.734,0.0037,8.9535,3.4276,7.5197,2.6383,2.0702,5.8353,0.5476,7.2038,3.6338,0.6455,2.2935,7.0419,2.5698,0.157,0.3149,0.0004,2.561,1.8048,1.7301,2.444,6.3661,5.6474,3.7393,1.1552,0.0029,2.3853,2.5536,1.2031,2.4542,0.1138,2.6365,0.0002,1.9777,3.8902,1.6987,4.2664,0.0229,5.3422,0.836,2.0939,1.6477,7.2862,11.7475,0.9086,0.154,11.2495,5.9025,1.4261,0.5728,6.3933,0.5125,3.3017,0.0052,6.4403,6.0168,1.4845,1.5267,5.9341,5.754,0.0425,0.8469,7.4331,5.4774,0.5127,1.3061,4.0817,0.0003,1.723,0.6852,4.3203,7.4221,0.0121,2.2,1.3994,3.7057,1.1778,1.2427,0.0002,5.0692,1.014,0.0002,6.5494,8.3678,2.109,2.2146,1.8972,3.3346,3.5226,1.3852,7.9948,3.0145,4.021,2.5836,0.4905,4.6867,8.9601,0.4852,2.1449,0.6022,0.2603,0.0353,0.364,3.4915,3.1,3.6312,7.4954,0.0546,1.2859,0.4859,0.5461,2.2551,0.711,4.6778,0.63,5.3485,1.3977,0.2993,0.0004,0.214,1.9777,2.9284,1.215,6.97,3.4204,3.7112,3.5309,5.3552,1.4026,2.6264,4.3998,1.2162,3.3224,3.2976,3.042,2.059,3.5704,1.5681,6.612,0.6263,1.9973,4.8079,0.0599,3.99,5.4763,1.386,2.7236,5.7458,2.1379,1.1337,0.7904,4.838,0.6013,1.2878,0.4181,1.8364,1.9465,0.7156,6.35,0.0726,2.2529,5.5889,2.1884,5.1455,0.0886,4.2657,5.9139,0.1652,5.8923,3.2921,0.3607,0.3712,1.3798,0.0001,4.3488,2.467,3.4597,3.7194,5.8364,0.0842,0.5718,1.8496,1.335,7.6116,4.4043,8.4477,2.0777,0.0737,0.2761,3.0517,0.1805,0.0008,3.1267,2.6786,1.804,6.6378,1.0069,1.4182,3.9389,0.0918,0.3982,2.194,0.4497,2.9508,0.0001,4.507,2.6168,0.2941,1.5031,0.646,0.0007,1.7724,4.3637,5.4964,0.1028,0.5317,2.3335,3.0496,4.67,0.2183,0.0008,0.0035,3.9205,5.6258,0.3338,3.6436,4.2317,2.8856,2.5366,2.5184,0.2071,1.9419,0.1519,2.3639,0.0001,2.3858,3.0611,0.4994,3.0128,6.1673,0.6739,3.4878,0.9525,4.9462,0.2189,4.8548,1.3067,5.5834,5.329,8.1347,3.6966,4.5042,6.03,0.3071,0.6528,0.9026,6.2269,1.9515,2.6052,0.4331,2.5471,0.0051,1.4688,3.7519,2.9961,0.0098,1.0084,8.1524,9.8744,3.4027,4.6821,3.8153,3.5521,5.4418,6.2968,1.7546,2.9761,5.9605,0.958,5.9217,1.6863,0.1294,0.0005,0.1426,1.062,3.9291,0.6436,1.0065,2.9007,1.4863,1.4553,1.3206,4.8438,4.0415,1.1692,1.4485,5.8341,0.0167,0.8902,0.7266,0.0001,4.561,0.9426,4.3719,3.5733,0.3579,0.3279,0.001,1.5557,5.3436,0.2206,5.4645,1.7662,4.1991,4.5021,0.1038,0.0025,0.0029,1.1931,4.2265,1.0104,5.9707,2.8102,1.2896,5.2138,2.3462,8.1835,2.6882,0.4157,0.3504,0.0011,2.3178,8.042,0.2021,0.5101,1.8436,1.0416,3.5026,7.1671,2.8666,2.3624,4.0639,0.3106,6.3738,1.2616,8.5896,3.0822,0.9319,0.4516,4.3803,0.3759,0.0001,10.8519,8.5317,7.3546,1.0837,5.4164,3.7681,1.9327,1.5872,2.6667,4.2865,2.5838,1.8572,2.4192,2.8331,1.7482,4.5823,0.6497,2.5513,2.763,6.0543,2.0222,0.2734,2.7253,3.4167,3.6209,1.1901,4.5462,4.6134,5.8759,2.1187,5.2948,1.1684,2.1139,6.1258,3.9908,1.886,3.9418,0.8942,6.5858,2.0669,1.3604,1.517,3.7635,4.1629,1.9095,2.0148,4.0384,5.8171,7.0406,4.2997,1.6896,0.2689,2.9845,7.7222,0.7867,0.0001,4.4274,6.0983,0.3589,3.3536,0.0454,0.0015,0.0048,0.6435,0.1105,0.001,3.5193,2.0966,0.7512,1.1208,1.8506,1.1208,1.8161,4.6481,0.1819,7.3804,0.0219,6.2689,1.0683,3.0951,6.2825,0.4527,0.2248,1.287,4.7487,1.5554,0.3977,3.6237,0.9056,1.4239,2.3998,6.5424,0.2408,5.366,3.4829,1.9024,4.9296,2.4298,2.4074,3.3134,1.3564,3.3021,3.7613,0.0111,0.2131,5.4473,2.4764,0.0032,2.713]}
{"id":2858,"ended":true,"length":462,"text":"It is often easier to compute complex powers by writing the number to be < unk > in polar form. Every complex number z can be written in the polar form < formula > by the function < t >. The polynomial form can be obtained by applying the logarithm to < formula > while using the complex number function < t >, so computing complex powers requires the use of complex number functions.\n\nThe logarithm is a complex number function. Complex powers are thus expressed as < formula >, the formula for the logarithm and < t >, and use of < t >.\n\nSimple power\n\nHere is an example where the simple power computation takes only 1 line of code. The input is a series.\n\nThe number to be divided to form the power is first evaluated in base 10 and its square root computed. This computation is the basis for the next calculation.\n\nDivide the simple power number in the exponent by and square the number in the exponent.\n\nThe division requires a complex number function. The following function can be used:\n\nNote that the power is stored in a data structure (data type, variable and function). Using the data structure is much faster than storing it in memory.\n\nDivide the quotient by the power in the exponent as well.\n\nThe quotient is a simple constant. If it contains a negative number this can be interpreted as a floating-point number. If it is positive, this can be interpreted as true. In this case the power is in binary. Since the number is in binary (1 and 0) we can then use the binas operator to display the result simply.\n\nComplex power\n\nHere is an example using a complex power number.\n\nThe division of first step produces a two-element data structure. The left part of the data structure contains the quotient of the power. The right part contains the result. We can use the left part for the second step.\n\nThe computation of the first step requires complex number functions. The division is a complex number operation.

The plot was based on Bode's own military experiences, and the musical comedy would make Mabel Vernon into a star, playing the title role of \"Orlando Dando\" who \"would turn up on her street corner and declare himself a man\". The production team included George Hackenschmidt and his brother Walter as the musical directors. [3][4] Orlandos other companions were variously a \"dapper English sergeant\", a \"sparkling French actress\", a \"plump and lively\" Austrian \"princess\", and Mrs. Whitey who served as a chorus girl.\n\nThe music was given an orchestration that included a full orchestra and a small chorus, using such modern musical tools as the introduction and coda in the form of long fugues interspersed throughout the rest of the score where previously the only musical interludes were in the form of songs. The main theme, an instrumental figure in the key of C minor, is at first a lively jig interweaved with a waltz of the same key, and this develops gradually into an orchestral climax. A dance which is similar in form to the waltz (in F) is introduced by the band in the first act. In the second act the action is taken to the French Quarter.\n\nThe title song, \"It's Not Easy Being a Man\", was performed by Fanny Brice, and it was the first recorded song performed on vocal. A second song called \"The Good Old Days of Old\" was also performed by Fanny Brice. She then took a break and was briefly replaced in the role by Alice Faye, who later would be replaced in the movie version by Doris Day.\n\nFanny Brice's performance as \"Fanny Dando\", one of the characters in the show, is remembered for her exaggerated, broad gestures and gestures of surprise. This style of singing with exaggerated gestures was referred to as \"Fanny Flapper\" and is still sung by many female singers today.","token_len":515,"entropy":[12.5479,0.2831,1.8537,11.1626,2.9059,0.112,8.1655,5.0261,6.4477,8.644,9.2617,3.3823,2.6113,0.902,1.4913,1.9724,0.706,8.5136,3.4095,0.0012,7.6819,4.9566,10.1345,8.7058,2.3535,3.8993,6.1212,11.0437,6.2456,5.9339,2.4755,3.2653,12.4729,3.6407,5.204,9.4114,9.6532,6.512,5.9222,1.1299,5.6206,6.3306,0.8291,7.6232,3.1209,0.038,6.8797,2.8909,2.6705,4.0054,7.9504,2.5446,0.1111,4.341,7.42,0.5055,3.4684,6.925,5.9023,2.1408,1.698,5.4176,3.7197,1.0659,2.3238,0.9066,0.1248,3.2391,2.713,5.3036,4.6863,6.8853,4.9927,3.5296,0.8138,4.3453,5.366,5.2429,1.8697,4.2383,4.873,0.048,4.1391,6.833,7.1685,3.625,5.6077,6.1465,0.17,0.0048,0.346,7.3788,1.2141,6.7977,5.2048,9.0282,1.0318,1.0607,2.5557,5.0499,1.3013,3.5671,0.2206,4.7638,0.0199,0.0399,3.4541,7.9459,3.032,1.5777,1.4404,2.3971,4.0884,4.6401,2.7014,5.0186,8.1019,4.1642,9.6641,4.3297,0.7736,3.9723,2.8318,5.6058,1.7469,5.3983,0.7497,1.5724,1.8652,6.3028,0.004,1.4902,0.0022,1.3599,5.4559,3.4548,2.9745,5.735,2.9456,2.5891,5.0573,5.4441,4.9943,1.8165,5.9026,4.3893,1.3649,4.7528,4.2191,2.104,4.569,3.5231,3.2096,5.1,7.8132,3.9984,1.478,0.641,2.1935,4.8777,2.3579,5.0298,4.8521,2.9377,3.5077,4.246,0.8418,1.6885,0.1852,3.9039,0.0418,0.1691,8.9758,7.5298,6.627,10.4201,9.6784,1.9892,7.4327,0.7934,5.8714,4.3627,4.491,5.3693,5.9385,7.5267,1.876,1.0027,0.7316,5.4897,3.0073,0.5677,4.1493,5.6623,0.6998,0.9925,0.3483,5.2669,1.602,2.8472,5.3955,3.941,6.9457,3.578,6.1149,1.0124,0.0094,0.5651,1.0109,8.4248,0.9215,4.383,2.2631,3.2373,5.0248,0.8712,1.3023,8.0391,4.1751,1.2853,2.2997,0.0009,1.913,4.1283,1.3823,5.3242,3.0267,6.2586,3.1607,3.5096,2.2837,2.1338,5.7416,0.4589,1.8451,1.6365,5.0859,4.3083,2.2368,5.4914,6.9431,5.9574,4.3038,5.8668,0.1313,2.7137,8.3791,2.7657,6.4056,0.8092,4.6814,1.2653,5.1914,0.0368,6.5851,6.4123,0.0923,7.1968,0.1274,0.0011,2.7365,0.4361,4.9174,0.0147,0.0443,2.3177,7.156,8.298,1.5365,4.7199,4.5358,6.3569,1.8012,0.044,0.4666,2.8572,0.6213,3.8279,0.0052,6.7419,1.6166,1.2477,3.7635,2.7308,3.3952,5.3874,5.4598,7.3339,2.7223,0.6507,8.7702,1.2889,4.9617,5.0,0.5942,2.8741,6.7234,2.4447,4.2878,8.8182,5.7515,4.2837,10.4616,5.8491,1.6464,0.1689,1.9489,5.6871,1.1108,0.0499,1.9674,3.3783,3.9296,4.6031,1.3857,2.3428,4.1868,7.7491,4.4523,0.7068,2.3921,3.4149,0.8242,0.0003,5.2582,1.353,3.7516,7.4614,5.4438,2.2093,4.9401,1.6222,2.1966,0.2767,1.0485,5.6584,0.0043,0.0897,4.8602,3.9861,7.2631,4.4469,1.1873,4.0293,2.1253,1.4982,5.782,3.0898,1.1064,3.4273,4.6047,1.9671,2.964,0.5002,0.9945,0.246,1.4069,5.9847,1.0245,4.1735,2.7935,1.8019,7.581,5.8245,3.0036,2.1603,0.0001,1.3486,5.6129,3.3767,2.096,1.5322,5.7363,0.588,3.4937,2.4822,0.5389,0.9452,3.5513,0.7149,1.5329,4.0001,0.5438,5.9885,3.9562,6.0825,4.2768,1.9066,2.6647,2.8926,1.2044,2.6521,1.1601,4.7464,1.8053,4.0465,3.2156,10.2015,4.3534,3.8864,3.4382,1.8042,3.7497,0.2007,2.1975,5.3294,3.8588,0.6239,2.2716,5.8029,2.5648,0.4075,1.8588,0.6199,0.7881,2.2575,0.0105,0.4388,0.0016,0.9332,6.0719,4.5088,4.0811,2.5412,2.9662,2.672,3.6945,6.7484,2.3564,2.8966,0.2276,3.2054,0.8106,6.1912,7.111,1.0989,1.8848,1.0555,3.7814,6.082,2.3835,0.7988,2.3599,0.2826,5.3648,4.5588,0.7263,7.3578,0.3562,3.8477,0.7194,1.1703,0.0001,5.0663,0.7706,0.266,0.0013,2.133,3.4303,2.1708,3.7322,3.7688,0.1736,4.6922,0.0454,2.867,5.5344,0.0265,0.4052,3.9872,1.143,0.5324,5.5034,0.3052,1.981,6.0491,1.2397,1.1558,9.0999,3.3553,7.9198,5.7814,1.1368,6.166,1.4859,4.9545,1.2092,3.6219,5.88,1.0365,3.3561,6.0955,4.8199,1.9464,2.3072,5.9062,0.0199,0.5155,0.6416,2.579,0.4232,6.3181,5.7727,1.16,1.8834,2.6024,4.118,4.128,1.0113,1.5805,5.0092,1.8944,1.6706,0.3132]}
{"id":1842,"ended":true,"length":401,"text":"The following < unk > of the dwarf planet Ceres is divided into 15 quadrangles. They are named after the first craters whose names the IAU approved in July 2015. The map image is based on the best-known quadrangle, Copernicus. The coordinates of all the quadrangles are in the same units of WGS84 (except Copernicus, which is in units of WGS84 + 23 WGS84). The north is up. The yellow-colored area on the picture is composed of Ceres Regio ( C ), the caldera of Copernicus, and the plain of Isidis Mons ( I ). In the map only two craters are visible: the relatively young crater Calirator ( Cal ) and the extremely ancient and eroded crater Facula ( Fi ), as well as a few smaller unnamed craters. In the upper left quadrangle we see Patera ( P ), the \"patera\" plain that was named in the first quadrisection of the map (in relation to the Sun). In addition to the big crater Iapygia ( I ), Patera has a small crater, Facula A ( Fa ). In contrast to Iapygia, Facula appears much more eroded. The dark surface color ( which you can observe in the upper right quadrangle as well ) is caused by the large number of basaltic and carbonate materials, although the smaller amount of craters is also present.

It was destroyed shortly before the revolt of Bar Kochba, or possibly after his final defeat in 135 and his subsequent death.\n\nBar Kochba took refuge in a cave near the fort. After his uprising was crushed, he was executed in 132 in Jerusalem. During his revolt, he attempted to seize Jerusalem, but failed.\n\nJewish settlers returned to the north of the town and built another fortified settlement known as \u201cKhan Eliezer \u201d north of the fort. It was destroyed during Bar Kochba\u2019s revolt. When the Bar Kochba revolt was suppressed, Hasmonean ruler Herod built a fortress on the eastern side of the ancient town.\n\nHerod was also responsible for the fortification of the city of Jerusalem, beginning in 28 B.C. These fortifications were mostly demolished after the Romans conquered the city, but some parts survived Byzantine times and remained in tact through the Crusades.\n\nMany of the buildings near the present city of Ashdod in the Bronze Age and Iron Age were destroyed in the Bar Kochba revolt, probably in 135 A.D. It is most likely during this time that the city took its present form. However, the town was rebuilt by Herod after the revolt was crushed.\n\nThe remains of Shechem were found in the village of Elah and the citadel, including the main synagogue, the main house, an orchard and an underground cistern.","token_len":516,"entropy":[7.826,2.4797,8.7536,4.5614,0.0363,3.6363,1.8492,8.7249,0.0257,3.7508,6.0964,6.2214,3.0085,5.0403,3.1963,11.1299,9.7387,2.1676,0.0944,1.3452,5.0189,1.7373,3.1237,1.9503,0.9169,5.7234,0.0059,1.4345,1.7975,1.7469,10.0319,6.0883,3.4796,8.6182,0.1498,3.6683,0.835,1.811,6.5901,0.0372,5.4222,1.2684,7.721,3.6799,2.1448,4.5515,0.1975,6.9791,6.1786,0.6756,0.7966,3.2943,6.2101,3.3931,1.9997,2.9755,1.3111,4.6865,4.1516,0.4202,4.7059,1.0079,0.5682,9.5131,6.7378,4.3942,3.9814,2.1702,5.8883,1.8205,9.9897,3.5104,0.0004,0.0099,0.282,2.2591,0.0377,3.1728,1.4921,4.1525,0.0169,0.6078,3.6122,6.7302,12.7795,1.4986,1.5613,5.9651,0.0688,1.5988,9.2449,7.273,1.0904,4.0497,9.836,0.2217,1.4689,3.5976,1.2549,6.1695,4.9186,7.3432,1.7603,2.9671,4.0265,6.5275,0.38,0.0048,0.0,2.6213,4.8792,0.7209,0.3706,3.9268,1.6151,6.5796,3.3389,1.4602,5.2637,2.4479,0.0517,1.8466,0.5451,2.34,0.0002,2.3402,0.5834,1.559,0.0139,0.3243,1.9997,3.8224,3.8569,1.3064,4.4605,1.8961,0.6048,3.5252,1.1818,0.0123,0.7386,1.8144,4.7777,1.2928,7.7714,2.7825,0.7429,1.1105,4.8757,4.5411,1.0383,5.5882,0.7159,1.0778,0.0002,0.0161,0.3315,2.0482,4.1713,0.0021,0.2656,6.1489,3.5681,0.9984,0.7688,6.1625,3.0796,3.6328,3.1175,5.6206,0.0013,0.009,0.0041,6.5358,0.9692,1.2532,0.0002,3.2384,2.911,3.6788,2.2771,3.739,1.8564,1.8137,6.413,0.5538,2.0551,1.4839,0.0023,0.0454,3.3862,0.4478,2.1106,0.0004,0.0119,0.534,4.4859,4.0459,1.1708,3.9336,2.1381,0.5196,3.1515,0.057,2.0474,0.4781,4.5425,2.0158,1.2667,0.5712,1.1,4.6767,1.7709,5.248,0.1337,1.7839,0.0101,0.7501,2.1156,0.8795,3.7685,5.2949,3.5057,2.4936,0.834,3.0261,5.6626,1.8128,0.622,4.3952,1.7165,5.297,0.0373,0.0033,1.6153,5.156,4.4938,2.8861,6.2573,6.0284,2.0052,1.7121,2.8979,6.1428,2.5473,3.3303,3.0262,1.072,0.466,0.0002,7.1942,0.0266,0.0055,6.3069,5.6991,0.4134,1.721,2.8125,2.8426,0.8882,4.7941,1.2576,4.5171,2.1743,8.3395,4.0547,2.1261,0.6345,1.7822,1.454,4.6889,2.4981,5.436,4.7261,4.0185,0.6272,4.8687,1.4073,8.692,0.3333,1.2339,4.8716,0.0951,4.882,3.8334,1.7709,0.4841,4.3554,0.56,1.5775,0.0002,5.7724,3.8132,6.6958,0.3617,1.6525,4.4704,1.5094,1.1747,1.4262,2.37,2.6281,4.2926,3.6274,0.8575,5.3654,0.0457,13.8351,6.7583,4.1539,6.0829,4.8242,7.133,0.1228,5.7804,5.7335,4.6149,0.1151,1.3585,1.3425,0.3587,1.8225,0.3563,2.2561,2.4159,3.5356,0.004,0.0026,9.6504,6.6909,2.3024,3.0359,0.9835,6.3583,0.8635,3.3945,0.0081,0.0137,1.4309,0.9432,4.1541,1.0154,6.0007,0.0198,1.4691,5.6891,5.5454,7.4988,0.5886,2.8139,1.6692,0.3993,2.8962,0.329,0.0488,0.2692,6.7513,1.2378,0.8481,1.0642,0.0001,5.8456,0.0235,3.2036,2.894,1.616,0.0077,1.0639,3.6919,0.4263,0.2848,0.998,2.507,1.0069,4.6026,1.6567,6.5556,0.8365,7.3099,0.9973,0.0003,0.0018,0.2604,7.0468,0.5541,0.0512,0.8882,5.5442,5.6097,3.3081,0.8341,5.6901,1.7468,0.8889,0.5135,2.645,1.2824,3.2941,5.2417,1.9343,13.1959,3.6361,2.2123,4.0156,1.2005,8.2729,4.2841,0.2545,5.1235,0.0278,0.3887,0.5975,0.0002,5.5571,1.3287,0.2192,3.5111,6.7638,0.5526,6.4821,3.2702,1.0797,3.9398,0.0792,0.0004,3.2565,0.5128,0.8981,0.0086,0.7053,0.054,0.8749,0.7065,1.3809,2.2632,0.4133,2.7373,0.0034,0.0045,0.8267,1.9194,1.9388,1.63,1.489,0.5851,0.0004,0.0021,0.117,4.6188,0.7731,5.8709,0.0795,8.139,1.2654,1.0039,0.1729,0.9568,3.103,6.3114,2.7893,5.7674,1.2,1.0706,4.6856,0.0363,1.6332,4.1395,1.5414,2.8957,2.1574,4.226,3.6133,1.052,2.5941,3.1235,1.46,0.9121,0.4548,0.0001,1.5896,4.7362,0.0385,6.0769,0.0023,1.9016,1.2311,0.7448,1.0642,5.2819,0.3869,2.0591,0.1265,3.4372,2.4807,8.5419,0.0061,4.252,5.921,1.2113,5.6747,3.8563,1.3407,2.1773,4.1863,4.7419,0.8244,4.6815,7.3679,1.2023,1.3893,3.1837,5.5323,3.7039,0.0001,0.287]}

Brosnan's first post @ 00:48 on the film was a tweet asking if he should be involved. Brosnan is the third actor to have been connected with a possible Thomas biopic, after Jude Law and Colin Firth. \"I really have a feeling she was an extraordinary woman.\n\nHe told TMZ: \"I believe that she will leave behind a lot of people that are going to share very important stories and memories of her because she was an extraordinary person\". Brosnan's new film, 'G.I. Joe: Retaliation' opens on June 29th.\n\nThe video has not only sparked questions as to whether she really was a ghost, but has prompted speculation as to whether the blonde actress was acting. TMZ reports the footage was captured by the \"spook hunters\" group Paranormal State in the UK, and that they will be posting the video on their YouTube channel, due to its \"unsettling\". \"I just want to know where this place is\", she said.\n\nIn what was an all-around bad day for Apple ( AAPL ), the company also posted disappointing third-quarter iPad sales and reported a major shortfall in Mac sales in its second fiscal quarter. The company revealed their intentions to keep going with the cash they have on hand at a time when many major consumer tech companies are going out and spending money hand over fist on acquisitions and new products for existing products.\n\nIt is also expected to feature the Apple Pencil that could enhance the users' experience in using the device. The iPhone 6s Plus is likely to come with the latest Apple A9 chipset with a faster processor. Apple Watch is expected to be launched sometime this year following the same schedule as iPhone's. But a lot has changed in the last one year.\n\nHe said, 'I feel that I am free from the shackles of the studio system now'. No, I won't. \"For me, the freedom to do something I absolutely love is something that's priceless in the movie industry which doesn't offer me a lot of those opportunities\".\n\nOn Tuesday, the BBC released two new Doctor Who clips in the same way it would usually reveal an unexpected twist in an episode of its television show. Moffat and Chris Chibnall have said that, despite recent rumours to the contrary, they will not be giving up Doctor Who.","token_len":516,"entropy":[8.9793,0.2442,12.1412,0.6234,4.4655,7.7515,3.0002,8.6261,2.0385,5.2197,1.8224,9.154,2.3073,8.3153,8.8923,0.0751,0.9804,8.413,0.0526,8.7733,6.5558,2.3318,1.0215,4.3399,6.8397,5.7286,4.9651,2.3498,0.1971,0.2675,7.5682,4.4735,0.7779,3.6251,0.0003,2.834,4.0946,6.0286,13.4913,11.334,1.854,4.4794,3.0722,2.0958,5.6235,4.5282,2.5412,3.4418,3.8669,1.6598,1.4575,4.7801,2.5059,3.0959,1.6812,5.0358,0.0012,4.1976,3.2508,4.7727,2.2297,0.5252,2.2744,2.3537,5.408,1.5399,2.3864,5.6496,8.2358,6.0812,0.029,1.3726,2.0395,8.6701,0.0049,0.5194,5.9518,2.048,0.0016,0.5002,4.742,0.948,4.3717,3.899,2.4875,3.2332,5.2621,3.9618,4.7051,6.918,2.4169,2.5731,5.6913,0.0017,6.3672,2.7875,5.4214,0.9952,0.0468,0.8851,5.5212,1.8427,2.1029,3.5153,6.6504,2.9732,0.9902,3.552,0.0597,3.9657,2.3223,1.9805,3.1672,0.0808,6.2587,6.5002,2.3986,1.9503,2.1248,4.6894,2.025,1.2198,7.3202,1.4876,2.2844,2.7529,1.1136,1.5031,7.5195,3.6162,0.0008,2.0166,4.5062,1.8544,1.158,4.2291,4.7216,5.4428,0.1489,0.1741,0.1118,0.9489,1.0853,0.0781,1.9094,4.5133,1.358,2.6883,3.8243,2.3247,1.0224,0.9079,0.0003,2.8828,6.4079,2.4979,4.8146,6.3307,3.6805,4.854,4.6215,0.005,0.707,4.4699,5.6808,2.7743,2.2671,5.7006,0.7769,0.2684,2.6107,4.4621,2.4337,2.3556,0.0095,0.7463,2.5255,7.8243,2.202,2.3215,5.6065,4.3371,6.0804,2.2739,3.5954,6.0307,1.5378,4.132,1.5095,2.8979,5.032,6.3764,2.7659,9.047,0.3961,7.8096,10.337,0.2342,7.8414,3.642,2.3434,2.5451,1.6278,2.2317,2.3389,3.2221,5.4656,1.4291,4.7982,1.7357,2.4236,1.3763,1.1035,2.5946,0.3125,3.189,7.3507,0.4139,3.0976,2.8078,4.6282,5.3841,0.0469,5.4805,3.636,1.8241,3.9102,1.7792,0.3594,3.6106,3.7799,2.7081,6.8683,0.773,6.4927,2.3574,1.2417,0.5305,1.3687,0.0003,3.7969,6.1062,3.2654,3.9956,5.6382,0.8978,5.5606,4.7059,2.8943,0.1158,9.2173,4.5156,7.3062,0.0006,1.0063,1.8582,2.2596,4.5754,3.8161,9.2952,5.507,1.3008,0.0781,10.7226,0.0933,2.9005,3.9305,1.7255,6.9951,5.8075,0.5636,4.6935,0.6848,3.1121,2.2833,2.1516,5.091,0.8778,0.6166,2.0452,1.1881,4.5934,7.1531,7.9016,0.2374,4.3938,5.5191,1.3756,1.7815,6.4998,5.4787,1.8848,2.9773,0.0515,3.584,2.4153,3.2441,0.2341,4.3823,6.7034,5.7986,3.548,0.4399,0.4361,5.4982,2.8493,5.1535,2.6213,2.4654,8.4046,2.8264,0.0325,2.5722,5.5602,1.9494,2.5524,0.8515,5.1082,6.3152,3.9095,0.3192,0.9279,0.0003,3.5911,1.2833,2.612,3.3675,1.3012,6.7682,2.4789,6.3336,6.7664,0.0097,5.0915,5.0439,7.9058,1.0469,7.1714,1.0881,2.5118,2.7291,4.711,1.0323,3.0554,0.7493,2.0111,4.3203,1.5233,1.6059,2.9657,1.7318,4.6192,0.1061,2.9823,1.048,1.9943,3.2783,4.0037,6.7198,1.7064,5.0608,3.508,1.7557,3.8844,0.6689,2.5789,3.7378,6.8295,1.8008,0.881,0.0322,1.7227,2.5778,3.4617,1.9419,0.3743,6.4599,0.8012,5.7547,5.6633,1.0927,5.0109,6.8898,1.3636,5.9611,3.9907,4.2407,2.2411,0.6189,1.5027,0.5734,0.9384,6.5371,0.3546,1.3509,1.448,0.0003,6.1318,2.1965,3.64,5.3053,1.1139,3.7461,2.4672,1.9682,1.6434,6.8411,3.2449,1.6904,3.1439,0.0034,0.4183,1.7833,6.907,4.4298,5.1825,4.2344,6.6158,3.4716,3.8328,4.1672,0.0008,2.6129,3.9533,5.374,0.9792,0.6721,1.9856,5.2199,1.4107,1.8575,3.8004,1.9222,5.9593,0.5674,1.3456,2.5917,0.6656,3.7353,7.4966,3.6089,2.11,6.1609,1.1753,6.538,6.0322,0.0005,7.0016,3.0004,2.2649,1.2254,0.184,7.5481,2.3413,2.6921,1.1339,0.0003,4.906,4.8638,0.3739,1.9919,5.0412,4.3131,5.3825,1.2952,9.3695,0.0432,5.3393,3.3023,1.8892,3.2145,5.2294,4.3221,5.6991,7.736,6.2487,4.203,6.5252,3.182,2.0417,2.792,1.196,1.718,3.4283,4.2856,1.4706,0.4248,9.0519,0.0052,3.1496,4.7355,2.133,0.035,0.0006,0.0064,2.7796,4.0221,1.2463,4.4463,3.7216,5.3546,3.0819,4.4447,0.0174,0.0275,0.1134,1.5926,1.8117,0.9195,0.9641,4.3632,1.8597,3.4985,0.0289,1.5602]}
{"id":3890,"ended":false,"length":474,"text":"Both species sleep in round nests up to 50 cm ( 20 in ) across made of interlaced lianas, branches, leaves, and twigs gathered from nearby trees and woven using the mouth, head, and neck, often supplemented by hair, wool, or moss. The nest is usually lined with soft, thick spider webs made of silk collected from the spider family (Araneae). Other spider families (Ophiuroidea, Pisauridae, Theridiidae ) may be present.[21]\n\nGiant pouched rats ( Cricetidae ) make round and conical nests on the ground, and sleep on their backs with their heads and noses up. They also use similar nests if placed directly on the ground, but have often been observed using nest boxes or tree cavities. The nests are 30\u201360 cm (1.2\u20132.4 in ) across, with their base a third shorter than their sides, and constructed of branches and leaves. Giant pouched rats and brown rats will often share nest boxes where they sleep together, but will fight violently when disturbed.[20]\n\nBrown giant pouched rats use a small conical or flattened nest up to 9 cm ( 3.5 in ) across and 20 cm ( 8 in ) long. They make this nest where they sleep, although some will make it in other places, such as under the bark of a tree or in the bark cavity of a termite tunnel. They construct their nests out of a variety of materials including bark of dead trees, plant twigs, plant hairs, leaves, hair, plant leaves, grasses, and roots. On occasion they use their mouths, and especially their noses, to weave their nests.[20]\n\nThe giant pouched rat is the most highly carnivorous of this group, with only some of its relatives eating anything besides plant material. They consume fruit and plant material, as well as mammals (particularly dogs and cats), other rodents, and bats ( particularly the fruit of the guano beetle). They also hunt small hares, voles, frogs, and reptiles.[22][23] They also eat insects, spiders and other small arthropods. They are opportunistic feeders, taking most of their food during the day, while sleeping during the night.[22][23]\n\nAlthough giant pouched rats are considered highly intelligent, captive individuals often exhibit aggressive tendencies, with some biting humans at close range, and a bite from one can be very painful.[16][24][25][26]","token_len":516,"entropy":[8.7482,10.4021,1.5641,8.9623,5.0439,6.4185,0.0221,3.7919,2.1385,1.9329,11.3246,0.9841,1.3384,3.8598,10.9246,0.8798,5.9909,4.8973,0.0992,6.4695,8.3953,2.7141,1.6015,7.9032,1.6443,3.4971,0.6597,0.811,3.7797,0.0027,9.4571,1.0228,5.3888,1.0891,2.2419,7.8513,6.4265,3.3471,8.2112,3.404,4.8132,0.1434,0.5283,2.3737,3.3175,5.0155,9.0874,0.4816,6.0861,2.0218,4.3604,0.0941,0.8296,6.292,0.4381,1.9672,5.25,1.6165,2.3424,6.7573,0.1965,5.7227,1.3909,4.8412,9.2238,2.1158,4.6547,0.4945,2.7435,8.6243,0.4431,1.3138,4.836,6.4598,4.2238,5.1227,0.5708,1.1991,2.0568,5.747,3.2618,4.4862,3.4931,4.8133,4.0315,5.1792,3.3691,0.0616,0.4759,6.4953,2.994,0.6109,0.2254,7.0041,2.6727,0.1533,6.6036,3.7284,1.4829,2.8376,9.2603,4.2801,0.198,0.9207,0.0003,5.5322,2.4465,5.4765,5.5506,6.9524,1.6727,6.7916,6.4416,4.0469,1.3987,0.2706,5.3161,9.2317,6.8003,7.0855,0.2585,0.1077,3.0354,1.2268,1.3374,1.5595,2.4354,6.5175,1.8661,3.5117,1.3111,2.6752,1.0523,2.9646,2.5927,5.9492,3.7068,1.3963,1.9358,2.5253,2.6449,7.4073,4.1254,7.8234,5.7166,4.2888,1.3969,0.8706,0.1809,1.6676,2.5838,3.5984,7.2114,0.5519,3.4878,3.2783,6.1871,2.8286,1.9571,6.7543,7.7665,0.0184,1.0689,2.3348,2.9284,0.9528,8.003,2.6227,2.1019,0.0746,0.4309,4.1692,1.5317,2.7172,0.6797,0.9815,0.2965,2.2865,0.4345,0.3552,2.9402,1.1272,1.8651,4.5446,5.5493,6.1286,8.1457,6.7844,0.5307,3.2786,6.8423,1.5045,0.8994,7.5545,0.7359,5.5075,1.3668,1.6629,1.6946,5.4633,0.446,0.0168,0.1048,5.0529,8.4604,1.1426,5.2495,2.5595,5.2775,4.9695,0.8697,4.8394,0.6308,2.2673,3.8724,1.112,1.8128,2.7779,7.7652,8.1616,1.9184,2.9738,2.3198,3.1375,0.1568,0.6245,0.0002,7.1801,10.1797,0.4554,0.02,0.0346,4.017,2.3872,3.8891,8.5637,0.0168,5.4428,5.9294,1.0739,7.3418,0.097,5.8585,0.2429,0.1158,4.2101,1.1868,1.36,0.489,0.0708,1.1611,3.0806,4.2242,0.603,0.027,3.8093,1.4724,0.0134,2.2063,1.4577,1.3399,4.0681,5.4461,0.3906,6.1507,0.5583,1.3132,2.5447,4.1804,3.7754,3.1245,4.3159,2.0995,3.7761,3.992,1.7226,1.6531,0.951,0.0018,3.6455,1.4919,3.1799,0.9435,2.1489,0.1793,1.2548,1.7519,1.1702,3.7263,8.5008,0.4187,0.6013,11.4646,0.0276,8.032,0.7385,2.0295,8.1968,1.5997,0.6298,4.4606,0.0118,2.8956,2.8463,0.0006,2.1326,2.0759,3.0597,6.3139,4.8971,1.4049,0.4714,5.9281,4.8005,0.0027,0.0605,5.4547,5.6366,0.2284,2.7595,0.2265,6.2514,0.4354,5.4349,3.9076,0.1795,5.2919,1.1618,0.0781,1.3779,4.3505,0.787,5.7459,2.4039,1.7186,2.9051,3.0766,5.208,2.5529,3.7024,6.3416,1.1639,2.7799,0.2644,0.2979,6.5419,2.8019,1.8211,3.3286,0.8498,0.0866,0.4788,0.0001,2.4865,3.6688,0.2865,0.0197,0.7038,1.6251,2.6202,1.9227,5.4572,4.949,0.015,1.0293,7.3471,1.4902,1.1921,1.6871,3.8429,4.8264,3.201,0.9395,2.1718,4.049,6.1974,4.8686,5.0559,2.719,0.9049,2.8118,3.8559,5.7027,1.3141,4.0953,1.6311,1.6151,2.9922,0.0606,0.0067,5.3468,3.6509,4.6858,4.8928,0.9583,0.5766,1.2082,5.4689,4.3718,0.2222,1.0432,6.1828,2.6138,8.1737,2.6674,8.2206,2.9625,2.0304,6.6759,2.8088,4.2116,1.7513,2.1655,1.5667,4.8565,3.1209,8.7916,1.4256,1.2722,8.1892,0.0794,0.1704,4.3884,0.0761,0.768,4.5701,2.407,2.5035,2.1783,0.3091,0.2565,2.6529,2.046,1.8009,2.2477,0.9897,4.1435,3.476,1.434,1.9855,7.5216,0.2452,0.0853,1.2378,2.1612,1.5445,6.2153,0.0695,7.0103,0.0082,1.4296,4.9387,6.6108,0.3,0.5472,0.6769,5.5924,0.763,0.8215,1.1424,3.7413,3.8866,4.1151,0.0793,0.0808,2.1781,2.047,1.2531,0.7437,0.1435,0.7722,0.0001,4.9322,2.9399,0.0538,0.0082,0.0529,1.2334,4.4359,4.9509,2.5595,0.7264,8.8391,5.6357,3.1423,4.0197,5.3001,3.7074,1.6682,3.839,2.4857,7.0038,3.6416,4.3042,4.0531,0.3499,1.6623,2.0809,5.5247,6.521,3.5323,3.5604,4.8691,1.8848,4.7835,1.5523,1.7278,4.3342,1.2822,0.7721,1.384,0.2356,1.2204,0.1501,0.4542]}

{"id":1375,"ended":false,"length":392,"text":"Davitt Sigerson from Rolling Stone magazine in a review of the album True Blue said that the song `` squanders a classic beat and an immensely promising title ``, LAUNCHcast's Bill Holdship said, `` [It] is one of the weakest songs in a set that has little to pick the worst off ``, and Allmusic. com described it as \"\" a pretty, if banal, love song. But there are plenty of others like it on True Blue; the album runs a little too close to the \"silly\" side of the Atlantic for this set.

{"id":3643,"ended":true,"length":464,"text":"The village of Isdud was occupied by the Egyptian army on May 29, 1948 and became the Egyptians'northernmost position during the 1948 Arab @ - @ Israeli War. While the Israelis had the upper hand in 1948, the Egyptians were able to hold the village until 1949 when, as a ruse, a UN Security Mission came through the narrows between the Sea of Galilee and the Sea of Tiberias to establish the new border between Israel and Jordan. The Security Mission consisted of American and French officers who then entered Isdud from the Jordan side.\n\nThe Egyptian government, fearing Israel and Jordan might attack, dispatched 3,000 men into the newly established buffer zone between Isdud and the Israeli - held village of Nahalat Bani Suheila to reinforce the position. The Egyptian men were attacked by a combined force of Israeli fighters and Jordanians who seized several hundred of their compatriots during the night.\n\nAccording to Israeli historian Igal Sarna, 2,000 of the captives are believed to have died during the massacre, with more than 100 being executed by firing squad and the rest sent into the Mediterranean Sea. Some of the dead Egyptians were buried on the shore. The bodies that floated to shore were brought to the nearest shore post and dumped into the sea. The Israeli soldiers then collected the bones for further analysis as well as photographs of the corpses.\n\nDuring the 1956 war, the Egyptian government refused to acknowledge Israeli presence in Isdud and continued its false claim until after the war that it was Egyptian territory. In April 1957, the government of Egypt issued a statement to the effect that Isdud was Egyptian territory and promised a full investigation by its government. The Egyptian statement in effect recognized Israeli sovereignty over the area and referred to the bodies found there as \"enemy\" remains. While Israel condemned the massacre, many historians doubt it to this day.\n\nPhoto credit: Wikipedia Commons (left): US Marines aboard the USS Essex prepare to land.

{"id":365,"ended":false,"length":471,"text":"After their short @ - @ lived television series Family Album was canceled, television writers David Crane and Marta Kauffman pitched Friends to then @ - @ NBC president Warren Littlefield as a sitcom about a group of friends, but their pitch was rejected. Instead, NBC executive Gary David Goldberg offered David Crane and Marta Kauffman two pilots, one about a family, the other about an office \"quota\" (i.e. \"The Odd Couple\"). They both turned down the opportunity because their ideas were different. Kauffman said later: [the sitcom pilot] was like, if The Odd Couple was about a divorced gay couple who were roommates. I mean, it's like if you had written The Odd Couple but had put them together because one of them was a woman. It just didn't really feel like you were giving them a chance to succeed. Friends was about women, a group of women.\n\nAccording to Kauffman and Crane, the pilot script for \"The Quota\" had been rejected by its network, due to its \"unwieldy\" name, \"The Odd Couple\", and because the script was seen as only good for an \"early '80s TV movie.\"\n\nInstead, NBC executives chose to develop a pilot for a \"sitcom about a group of friends\". Kauffman said:\n\n\"Because it was a group of women, they made the mistake of thinking you can't really have a group of friends because they go on so many dates and stuff...We thought, well...this is just sort of a different type of comedy. I don't think the networks get into a panic when the female star is in a comedy. You don't get the same reaction as if the male star is in a situation comedy.\n\nIt was too soon for Friends to have a \"love interest\", and Kauffman said she would not have liked to have written a love story into it anyway:\n\n\"I'd like to see the women get it on, you know, that's where the action is, but to do a plot about romance and get it right was not in the cards. We were still trying to get women to have it on. Like we're not quite ready.\"\n\nThe Friends pilot script was written by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, David Crane directed the pilot, and the pilot ran on March 28, 1994, on NBC.\n\n[Source: David Crane\/Marta Kauffman; IMDB]","token_len":517,"entropy":[5.588,7.1704,14.3489,9.7933,5.7776,10.4414,10.9294,3.996,9.4557,7.9909,3.7193,3.1892,1.4179,9.1476,6.5907,4.9482,6.2069,0.2821,8.1834,1.6092,4.8482,0.8799,0.0175,6.6715,10.6364,1.8028,6.9629,7.071,3.4776,1.1734,4.1739,5.7078,6.6887,5.2816,2.6094,4.1805,0.9407,6.0874,3.0388,1.3751,3.5323,0.0521,2.4348,3.0157,3.1281,4.7628,4.3918,1.3105,1.3835,1.2371,5.2665,0.3312,4.1497,5.8382,6.2421,6.5629,8.3203,3.5341,6.9853,1.9057,1.487,0.3027,0.0005,0.2039,0.0019,0.0028,4.6937,5.9633,1.8547,2.5349,2.7023,0.9727,2.551,2.3202,1.619,0.0214,0.3687,2.7662,6.3009,7.8214,7.5611,4.5159,1.7318,3.5981,4.083,0.0012,0.0005,1.3819,3.8947,5.3477,7.6597,0.1865,0.0071,0.9648,3.9057,3.4154,4.5881,0.3279,0.5363,4.1696,3.9601,3.2702,5.3826,0.9375,3.1357,1.2025,8.3963,0.0026,0.004,2.9331,6.5038,2.2563,5.2424,4.0941,4.812,5.2741,0.2851,1.0078,3.9225,1.776,5.5571,6.8807,1.5811,0.0009,0.0043,1.9081,2.972,0.8373,8.2324,6.4836,0.7064,2.1561,3.8381,6.1626,0.0001,4.5223,2.6588,3.3758,0.1426,2.068,1.5417,2.6786,3.9216,2.6093,3.2679,6.07,2.8913,1.6643,0.0026,0.0015,5.3361,3.5945,5.2295,4.4219,1.2632,4.634,4.7725,0.644,0.8725,0.7283,1.5044,4.1684,1.516,2.2937,3.5683,1.8351,0.001,4.6485,2.2752,1.1292,4.2171,1.4755,5.2593,0.9914,1.4447,2.2476,1.0007,4.7816,0.5043,6.6639,1.1939,2.5084,6.6771,1.7132,4.7784,2.3965,0.1947,2.7695,1.572,2.5783,0.005,6.2152,0.0047,3.5342,0.0042,0.0031,3.0013,1.5311,0.2007,1.4748,2.9303,5.4248,2.2593,5.6354,2.7607,8.3777,0.0862,0.16,2.5995,1.8151,2.3748,1.4116,5.9094,4.9599,1.9095,5.8107,0.1069,2.0873,1.9189,3.8993,3.6306,5.4342,0.0204,1.1607,6.2327,1.9843,3.2028,2.974,3.0895,0.008,0.0068,3.4176,1.3116,2.788,1.6727,4.2825,1.141,7.0496,0.5424,7.2091,6.1532,1.2928,3.8767,2.7333,4.8048,4.5509,1.9877,0.0607,3.7684,5.282,1.9557,1.3321,0.0002,6.8998,0.3314,3.626,3.3174,4.9565,0.8603,4.7782,1.3989,2.5388,1.4433,2.2354,3.4698,8.2976,0.4638,6.869,0.5528,1.7423,0.0109,0.7358,2.9218,5.1622,0.0026,0.0028,1.0029,1.6287,1.5589,0.0002,2.1061,5.7371,2.3293,0.8006,1.8928,4.1456,0.4915,3.1461,0.6526,3.139,5.1869,2.0554,4.7679,0.1613,3.3705,5.1546,2.9579,2.0545,3.8456,2.1356,0.8003,2.0935,0.4377,1.5738,3.4753,2.0802,6.9045,2.4654,4.8488,1.0732,2.1422,1.8296,4.6416,5.2691,5.7014,2.6408,1.3057,2.3471,4.48,3.6356,0.7318,3.1421,4.5154,0.0057,1.1425,5.1627,2.939,0.0106,2.0373,1.1857,3.2607,2.4701,0.0009,0.9921,3.1698,6.0901,5.7547,4.3812,4.5489,6.3511,3.0009,3.9014,6.3998,6.5652,1.8123,2.817,1.0019,3.3325,1.4793,3.3513,2.8215,0.0005,2.0073,3.2767,1.8013,4.0262,2.3559,2.5719,2.5561,1.9301,0.2142,0.5774,0.9575,0.2884,8.322,8.8795,1.0831,2.8104,0.0002,4.8265,1.0953,5.6923,4.2201,1.1358,5.6775,0.735,2.9227,1.1309,3.9958,7.9589,1.5025,2.3938,2.2843,4.7053,0.0016,0.0029,0.6017,3.1864,3.809,2.1761,1.1753,3.0534,1.132,1.4453,5.7249,1.1442,3.5442,2.4081,8.1743,3.1157,6.3621,1.8428,0.2797,0.0002,0.3707,1.1961,3.4651,2.4791,0.2757,2.3465,2.1884,5.057,3.088,4.7041,3.4389,2.8663,4.9634,0.026,0.8707,3.6582,1.5214,4.2518,1.5175,5.3884,1.3246,1.721,2.2783,5.29,2.9022,2.5872,6.9224,3.0627,6.7639,1.4306,6.459,1.4222,3.1419,3.6203,2.9831,3.438,1.0809,2.1284,0.8759,2.6582,2.2698,5.1188,2.1316,0.044,1.8049,5.9301,0.961,2.8935,3.3818,2.2299,1.4056,6.1101,2.6222,2.6287,2.78,4.5704,2.2473,4.1844,0.0897,0.0002,2.6156,4.175,1.2955,3.0594,0.864,3.808,0.3274,2.2556,0.35,0.9353,0.2058,0.0006,0.0362,0.0019,0.0026,0.9438,6.6446,1.7315,6.5312,1.4828,0.5468,1.2025,0.4421,3.3691,3.0179,5.5644,2.7721,6.2934,3.7366,0.2897,3.6119,1.6257,2.2166,0.6919,0.7918,0.8647,0.0002,4.7226,2.9209,0.0516,5.1978,0.0891,3.7062,8.6276,0.0049,0.0135,0.003,0.0038,5.0888,4.9439,1.1381,0.9268]}
{"id":725,"ended":false,"length":462,"text":"Gibson Guitar Corporation, whose guitar likenesses have appeared in the Guitar Hero series from the first game to Guitar Hero Aerosmith, informed Activision on January 7, 2008, that it believed the Guitar Hero rights on the Gibson trademarks were invalid. Activision immediately responded that it had \"complete, undisputed rights to manufacture, market, distribute and license the Guitar Hero-branded, trademarked game products through Activision U.S.A., Inc. \" On May 30, 2008 Gibson and Activision entered into an amendment to the May 6, 2008 agreement, in which Gibson reaffirmed its desire to acquire Guitar Hero rights on and use of Gibson trademarks through Activision.\n\nContents\n\nGibson acquired rights to the Gibson name from MCA Records in 1985, but the company has not had a presence in the United States as a major manufacturer of rock instrument hardware in at least twenty years. Gibson Guitar Corp. of Nashville, a privately-held company that owns the Gibson trademark and is not publicly traded, is the U.S. manufacturer of guitars under the Gibson name.\n\nIn 2002, Guitar Hero was first launched as a \"guitar-centric\" rhythm game, using licensed Gibson guitar models for game play and to form the basis of songs. All the rights were purchased by Activision Publishing in November 2003. It is estimated that, by September 2004, as many as five million (5 million) guitar controllers were in the hands of gamers.[1]\n\nGibson's dispute with Activision involves the right to use of the Gibson name on electronic games, but also concerns potential infringement of the Gibson trademark on acoustic Gibson guitars.\n\nIn 2008 Gibson informed Activision, who produced the Guitar Hero series, that their Gibson brand would not be used by the company, and would therefore take legal action against any use of their Gibson Guitar trademark by Activision in future Guitar Hero titles[2][1]\n\nOn September 11, 2008 the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office published the U.S. Patent Application No. 20090198185 for a \"Method and apparatus for authenticating a simulated performance of a virtual musical instrument.\" The Gibson trademark is referenced in said patent in the \"Guitar Controller Identification\" category.\n\nLater during the month of September, while the '915 patent was still being considered by the USPTO, Gibson's lawyers held a conference call with Activision on behalf of their client with Activision's legal counsel and their attorneys to inform them of Gibson's intent to move forward with an ongoing lawsuit regarding trademark rights.[3]","token_len":518,"entropy":[8.0656,0.9363,9.9779,7.8928,1.9846,6.3352,3.8513,10.8585,2.8729,2.1479,2.4201,0.8451,2.8038,7.2999,0.8474,1.2919,4.7043,1.2332,3.3811,0.6134,1.6241,3.8994,0.031,17.5911,0.6654,0.0188,1.7678,11.9219,5.6563,3.355,3.7493,3.4483,1.0152,3.3432,1.6493,0.334,2.2296,6.7241,1.1446,3.6359,0.0351,10.7763,6.0674,1.2146,7.7765,8.0273,1.1264,3.7171,0.6072,4.2044,4.6823,3.6891,2.2956,1.5689,1.7226,3.0901,5.9238,5.3914,7.5203,0.0166,4.2759,1.4182,7.1299,0.9621,2.9297,0.555,1.6404,1.0024,4.0325,1.2221,0.6044,0.0161,6.6697,1.6579,3.9097,2.7402,0.0875,5.3548,4.9497,4.8879,3.437,6.9277,0.138,0.0349,0.152,0.2739,1.5539,1.7788,1.5011,3.9876,6.8726,4.5329,3.5515,0.0115,0.4304,8.0276,4.9692,1.1961,5.5843,0.0312,1.2466,7.6433,0.5326,0.5428,9.8407,4.5559,0.0745,0.1963,3.2094,1.8045,2.9805,0.0541,1.5266,7.0423,0.0318,0.7547,4.8849,0.134,3.7698,2.2247,0.0108,2.8156,2.9279,4.9272,5.9193,6.5431,3.1306,3.6357,5.7151,1.8306,2.458,1.8554,0.0006,6.3754,3.5838,0.0002,2.9024,0.4543,0.0001,7.4036,3.7823,0.4783,1.2207,3.7606,5.181,2.1182,6.9981,3.1661,3.7261,0.9488,4.5962,1.4115,3.3097,2.1405,2.227,3.1212,1.1677,4.18,1.368,5.1791,0.5639,0.7898,1.1935,0.0091,5.6198,0.7914,3.3046,3.4545,1.0602,6.6358,4.534,4.6338,3.4443,5.4048,0.0071,3.746,0.3699,0.2299,2.3825,2.1934,3.4998,0.2083,5.1158,6.3617,0.407,5.8908,5.285,2.8411,0.199,0.818,2.3699,2.9137,1.952,2.2292,6.0218,2.4104,2.3836,3.6244,6.3649,1.094,0.3812,1.9535,1.7539,5.4958,0.0014,0.0031,0.0908,2.4799,0.124,4.1697,4.6603,0.8613,1.4467,2.4526,0.4895,1.091,0.0001,2.2738,4.3506,0.2332,3.9919,0.1331,1.3736,4.0032,4.2702,2.1194,0.4128,4.6106,3.8299,0.035,0.0076,2.2956,3.6178,0.3017,7.5576,0.7872,2.076,4.5206,7.3461,3.4917,2.0533,2.8103,3.6942,6.5433,0.4647,1.7459,4.3281,6.7058,1.8258,0.4945,0.499,7.3565,1.3929,6.3629,2.8771,7.5699,2.9532,3.594,0.4458,2.901,5.3408,1.6374,4.7178,2.1496,0.9225,4.4756,1.5282,4.559,0.1185,4.9413,3.1037,4.5942,1.1089,0.0676,5.8702,1.0372,0.0062,4.0388,0.2852,6.0268,1.3827,1.0274,1.7406,4.1409,6.2454,0.8612,4.1333,1.8408,0.8201,0.0014,3.7163,6.8648,1.1879,0.0774,0.7214,0.0001,1.7394,0.2277,0.0003,2.5151,8.4986,0.2548,1.3426,5.927,1.5422,5.5795,0.2149,0.9671,5.8933,0.7109,2.6822,1.919,1.9927,5.5897,4.1291,1.4134,3.9321,2.3559,5.5859,7.3273,2.1955,0.6239,1.1289,3.3887,1.1525,2.7415,5.7543,11.7881,1.0363,0.6527,1.6916,0.0002,2.3768,3.4221,3.6769,5.4046,1.0312,3.744,4.9002,6.839,1.1211,1.3221,0.0216,2.0876,0.7067,0.2032,3.9794,4.7887,3.2815,2.3086,1.0231,0.2299,1.7688,3.3246,1.7409,2.0395,2.971,1.1942,3.1393,4.3785,4.7384,4.2896,0.0711,0.5942,3.7562,5.4204,0.1848,2.7491,3.5054,3.5469,2.6257,3.1239,2.2141,3.6565,4.3154,2.4753,0.0207,1.6117,5.8673,0.0729,3.6428,5.2419,1.0858,1.6981,0.0001,2.9612,2.7179,3.1477,0.0511,0.6033,3.4202,2.4483,0.0008,0.0128,0.004,1.2367,0.1657,0.001,0.0002,0.0262,5.5067,2.9007,4.7141,0.0039,0.0064,0.0045,0.3857,2.6776,1.9753,0.0033,7.915,4.5217,4.6709,9.4622,1.2947,1.0869,2.0694,7.16,2.7944,3.4358,0.432,8.007,0.0687,2.4368,7.302,5.503,0.8747,0.8428,5.4982,3.476,0.458,3.3027,1.0744,9.5838,0.9532,1.953,5.6097,0.5484,9.3597,0.7416,3.1616,1.358,3.6305,3.6083,0.7883,0.012,8.938,7.0061,2.4779,7.3163,2.0253,0.799,0.0002,6.2678,6.8312,0.6674,4.6383,0.2561,1.101,1.5068,6.4398,1.859,7.8695,13.7432,3.3901,0.5675,2.3433,1.798,2.8227,1.3795,0.1939,2.9657,0.3013,0.0005,0.4876,2.5612,3.3136,3.3019,5.8801,0.3669,3.172,0.6258,1.1462,2.498,4.1905,3.8966,0.0018,2.2316,2.4815,5.0164,5.0949,1.6221,3.6694,1.1162,2.9022,4.6684,3.3624,3.0565,5.8951,0.2512,1.0532,3.7091,0.0995,4.2825,0.0817,5.4461,0.6826,0.2924,3.5417,5.553,2.1746,4.1293,5.6207,4.1386,3.4072,0.1416,0.1487]}
{"id":1110,"ended":false,"length":467,"text":"The lumber boom on Plunketts Creek ended when the virgin timber ran out. By 1898, the old growth hemlock was exhausted and the Proctor tannery, then owned by the Elk Tanning Company, took center stage. As new mills were constructed, most of the local logging jobs went to the men who worked the new mills while a few jobs remained for local loggers, many of whom were former \"river rat\" lumberjacks. Although this boom lasted only a few years, local businesses thrived because of it, and the community was generally prosperous at this time.\n\nThe largest industry in the region and the town was once again lumbering. In the early 1900s the old growth timber on the stream was exhausted and replaced with the younger virgin growth lumber. During and after this timber boom, work crews built log mills near the creek ; one in 1903 on a log dock on the creek just above Pomerantz Bridge and another mill near the ferry crossing off Bridge Road in 1906. These mills were operated by the Elk Tannery Company and built on its land south of the Proctor tannery. When the tannery was abandoned, the mills were operated by the North Carolina and Tennessee Railway Company which, like the lumber industry in general, was in decline by the late 1920s.\n\nAlthough milling declined in the late 20th century, many former mill workers moved to the area and their children were born in the area where they now lived. Many members of the original mill families retired and built new houses and businesses of their own. Timbering continues to be an important part of the local economy as it has always been.\n\nSince that time, the community has continued to grow by adding additional housing near the creeks and by adding the newer housing development east of the creek.\n\nThe area around Plunketts Creek was also known as Big Creek Township when first settled, and later renamed Plunketts Creek Township after the creek. This name change was probably due to an earlier settlement by the same name which was on Big Creek in the southern part of the State along the borders of Burke, Macon, Henderson and Montgomery Counties.

{"id":2175,"ended":true,"length":464,"text":"`` Like... Chopin ``, writes pianist and academic Kenneth Hamilton, `` Alkan's musical output was centred almost exclusively on the piano ``. Some of his music requires extreme technical virtuosity, and not just the ability to sight-read, he goes on to point out, `` the piano offers the performer, unlike the violin or cello, no direct contact with the performer's 'inner performer' (a distinction that is more true of the latter three instruments than of the piano)-- the performer can only hear through the piano, and she\/he has to rely very heavily on the support of the audience and the pianist. ``\n\nThe pianist and musicologist Kenneth J. Hamilton offers an up-to-date account of Paul Alkan's music and his place in history as a pianist and as a composer of some of the most significant and expressive pieces ever written for the piano. Alkan's compositions reveal the range of his astonishing technique and his mastery of sonorities, and Hamilton shows in vivid detail how both of these skills were developed in relation to the piano. For all his fame, his reputation as a composer has not advanced to the extent that it could have been, and this work provides a detailed insight into the reasons for this.\n\n`` Like... Chopin ``, writes pianist and academic Kenneth Hamilton, `` Alkan's musical output was centred almost exclusively on the piano ``. Some of his music requires extreme technical virtuosity, and not just the ability to sight-read, he goes on to point out, `` the piano offers the performer, unlike the violin or cello, no direct contact with the performer's 'inner performer' (a distinction that is more true of the latter three instruments than of the piano)-- the performer can only hear through the piano, and she\/he has to rely very heavily on the support of the audience and the pianist. ``\n\nThe pianist and musicologist Kenneth J.

{"id":4787,"ended":false,"length":424,"text":"In the run up to the announcement that an invasion force was to be sent to Guatemala, 10 @, @ 000 Nahua warriors had already been assembled by the Aztec emperor Cuauht\u00e9moc to defend the city, known as Huehuetotl in the Nahuatl (\"Teotihuac\u00e1n\") language, against the approaching invaders. This may have been out of fear of what their former \"friends\" at the Aztec capital city of Tenochtitl\u00e1n might do to them.[1]\n\nIn preparation for the battle, Cuauht\u00e9moc himself and a number of his officers, along with some of his warriors, were transported to Huehuetotl aboard two of the city\u2019s merchant ships that had earlier been converted into warships. Once there, as on the previous occasion he had arrived there, he was treated very differently by the local population, which consisted mainly of a Nahuas speaking population who considered him a barbarian and feared for the safety of their city and their belongings. The presence of the Aztec emperor in their midst increased their suspicions.[2]\n\nThe initial confrontation with the invading force took place at or near Huehuetotl. Cuauht\u00e9moc and his small band of warriors attempted to defend the city against a large army of Pizapatzin warriors commanded by H\u00e1jar.[3] When their ships were attacked by the enemy vessels they made the mistake of abandoning their craft in order to defend themselves, while the bulk of the city\u2019s inhabitants remained within the city itself. H\u00e1jar and his troops then proceeded to completely destroy the city and all the buildings in it.[2] Cuauht\u00e9moc and his men then attempted to escape the city via a subterranean passageway that led from Huehuetotl into the city of Tenochtitl\u00e1n, the future capital city of the Aztecs.[1] This passageway, known as the Nohuatl \u201cUnderworld Pathway\u201d,[3] is thought to have been heavily bombarded with projectiles, possibly even with siege engines, by the advancing forces of H\u00e1jar.

{"id":2566,"ended":true,"length":444,"text":"Following their arrival at Port Moresby, the 16th Brigade along with the 25th Brigade, prepared to relieve the forces on the Kokoda Track. With the Australians having finally halted the Japanese advance, the task on the Kokoda Track quickly changed, with a much stronger Japanese force being concentrated to capture Gona, a key position a few miles off of Port Moresby.\n\nGona was surrounded by four Japanese divisions, along with hundreds of armed guerrillas. The Japanese 8th Division had been sent through PNG by sea from Darwin in late December. Along with the 9th Division, they had by this time reached Manus and were due to link up with two more Jap army divisions which were waiting somewhere on the Pacific side of the South Pacific.\n\nFor the Allies to have any hope of holding this vital junction, the two New Zealand divisions were to be heavily reinforced, with thousands of reinforcements being sent from Australia. New Zealanders also provided much of the support for the 2\/2nd Reinforcements, which were to be reinforced by the 25th New Zealand Brigade.\n\nJust as the reinforcements arrived, the Japanese attacks recommenced. With a strong Japanese reserve of artillery, tanks and infantry, the Allies were now cut off, with no means of escape.\n\nThe Japanese attacks were supported by a naval bombardment of the town of Kokoda, and the 2\/14th Brigade began landing. Under fire, the soldiers of the 7th\/2nd Reinforcements struggled ashore and quickly prepared defences. Then, almost immediately, the Japanese launched counter attacks against the 7th\/2nd Reinforcements. On both sides, both sides had a desperate struggle, although the counter attacks were much more successful. The 7th\/2nd Reinforcements lost many men, while on the Kokoda Track the Japs had made many advances. The losses were huge on both sides, as well as the destruction of many vehicles.\n\nFinally, on 19 August, the 2\/14th Brigade was relieved by the 2nd Reinforcements. On August 24, the Australians reported the Japanese had captured Kokoda, and on 29 August, the Jap forces were driven out of Gona. It took until 15 September for Australian troops to retake the town.\n\nUnfortunately, while the capture of Gona had ended the initial attack on Kokoda, it had proved to be only a temporary victory, as at this juncture three more Japanese divisions were being readied to attack the Allies further north along the Kokoda Track.","token_len":518,"entropy":[5.5485,3.8378,1.918,5.8831,4.0992,0.0029,0.0001,0.7339,1.6952,8.0843,3.3165,4.6541,7.8428,0.0417,1.7453,4.9751,0.0333,2.8838,2.1186,7.4654,0.5269,6.6619,0.975,5.12,3.0398,0.6474,9.6587,2.7897,7.6741,1.1029,4.8914,1.0062,8.9935,3.5209,6.5841,7.1531,1.188,4.3315,0.1855,0.7447,0.8953,7.0573,4.3277,0.521,1.6002,0.0046,0.2086,5.8004,4.5478,2.4097,0.8763,3.3507,6.0357,4.1726,1.7925,1.7536,3.8369,5.6956,4.4503,6.0016,7.1686,7.0171,2.5543,3.4008,3.5311,3.7637,7.5587,0.8658,1.324,4.1012,2.9883,3.266,0.0453,0.0008,0.0001,0.2751,1.5993,0.104,4.2679,0.1595,0.913,5.3253,0.4192,5.4207,1.4029,1.9307,0.9322,4.5655,0.0173,6.898,0.0382,6.9387,5.7453,0.017,0.0001,1.2158,1.3907,1.9531,8.33,0.0637,1.0064,3.108,1.8021,3.023,5.8025,9.3775,4.0557,7.0489,3.7176,5.5199,3.1874,4.0807,3.2653,2.2717,6.0074,0.3589,0.8114,4.102,0.0031,0.2348,0.5523,2.8817,1.46,8.4463,2.0505,0.0932,3.5121,5.4427,1.5075,3.4804,3.0383,5.9893,0.2564,9.1986,0.0432,0.5348,4.8872,2.6365,7.6677,2.5009,8.367,1.0638,4.4215,0.9816,5.0466,8.4724,1.9925,0.5155,4.1482,1.8364,0.6435,0.87,5.4595,0.361,0.4506,1.3897,0.0002,5.5149,1.0651,6.8837,3.3375,3.8548,2.8794,2.0336,0.1081,4.0377,3.2698,2.7002,5.2305,1.09,1.3271,4.7091,6.6924,0.3593,1.2533,1.7513,1.3863,1.2405,5.9957,1.9098,1.9153,1.4899,6.0896,0.1834,5.2011,2.7528,0.9951,2.0955,3.1476,1.3782,5.7767,0.0037,5.1689,4.5516,5.0775,4.8534,0.7546,0.0925,2.4679,1.2819,0.307,4.1065,6.2885,3.0191,2.7159,10.9344,0.4675,0.2612,1.4206,1.7989,1.183,2.0192,1.3122,3.2319,1.3329,1.4778,5.1772,0.0129,6.8958,0.0212,2.5636,1.1482,0.8414,0.0002,6.4653,1.6731,0.6892,5.3953,1.806,1.0171,0.9747,1.934,7.3055,8.2239,0.0155,1.3068,3.4851,3.183,3.4735,2.331,6.5117,2.8261,6.3502,1.3635,3.1548,0.5667,2.3185,0.836,0.6744,3.9707,1.6438,3.3159,7.8837,0.2106,4.0973,2.5119,3.2699,2.6905,0.2039,5.0163,0.6028,2.082,0.0002,1.5422,2.4186,6.2456,1.919,6.612,0.094,1.8652,5.5577,2.3278,0.8988,1.035,4.5829,0.5462,4.0785,0.1331,0.9282,3.0084,1.76,4.6502,0.8109,8.8895,0.0551,3.4398,4.3977,5.6423,3.91,6.704,3.1044,2.8276,0.8229,6.0549,1.8133,0.1861,5.4096,0.0539,6.5012,3.45,0.0972,3.2715,0.0072,0.0371,6.7637,7.2522,2.5838,4.7236,5.8213,5.8536,0.9489,6.5375,0.9605,6.7995,1.4664,1.0154,0.9163,1.8808,3.7145,5.3521,1.645,3.1442,0.3881,4.2084,0.0387,0.9447,0.0256,0.0057,1.9112,0.0101,0.0023,0.9874,4.0894,5.5053,1.1707,0.5509,4.5787,1.3977,2.4625,3.7853,5.4594,3.3038,3.3333,5.3931,1.1303,5.647,1.1896,0.99,4.1137,1.1242,1.3115,0.6027,2.1379,2.4433,0.0174,0.437,0.0073,0.0044,1.3346,0.0053,0.0142,4.0107,3.8892,2.5418,1.2208,2.4072,5.3946,0.3652,0.9505,0.0019,2.0235,1.4333,5.867,3.2715,2.5408,4.8024,3.2645,4.1236,1.4018,2.0433,6.1006,0.949,3.7214,4.7994,0.1222,0.0838,0.6358,2.2154,2.8191,0.0445,1.6236,4.5334,0.0981,2.13,4.5552,1.3853,0.5311,0.0002,4.9749,0.1536,1.2769,4.3411,2.8695,0.8569,0.7833,2.7262,0.4124,0.7733,0.0157,0.701,1.6418,3.6781,1.9094,0.5523,2.3084,0.381,2.5243,0.0065,0.0156,1.6871,3.148,7.1935,2.9034,0.7424,0.8628,5.4589,5.3824,2.2261,2.5136,4.2544,3.9881,2.0092,0.0049,1.318,1.3087,2.871,3.2045,0.0627,1.5187,0.8429,3.8718,1.6331,2.8,1.883,4.5154,2.0344,0.3859,5.3408,0.004,0.6856,4.6021,3.0506,3.5187,4.5363,0.4314,1.1866,4.0672,2.1648,0.4618,5.1675,0.5781,1.1154,0.7923,0.8168,0.0002,6.5628,0.4701,4.2514,0.6748,6.6225,0.1569,1.1364,0.0013,1.9974,6.2485,0.6572,6.3614,4.9644,0.4997,3.4535,0.0039,0.2792,2.2312,1.4673,5.7648,1.226,0.0379,4.8414,0.9055,1.3543,2.211,1.8708,0.9587,5.5938,3.0318,4.4289,0.0,6.5105,2.8639,0.9045,0.8554,1.022,3.7042,9.4998,0.0196,0.7904,2.4148,1.1033,5.7856,6.2026,2.1428,4.5401,0.1689,0.9367,0.008,0.2246,0.1864]}

The ad was designed by Paul Buhle who has worked on various ads for Ford, Chrysler, GM, Standard Oil and Mobil.\n\nAccording to the History of Advertising, \"this is the last time we will ever see this ad.\" The reason may have been because the driver appears to be drinking an alcohol product that was illegal at the time.\n\nI know that some of you have seen this and I have seen the print and it appears the car being driven was a Porsche 356 ( which you may know was the car that was driven in many famous movies). But I have seen others say that it is a Chrysler 300. Here is the original ad with the car clearly shown being a Porsche...\n\nThe print is quite small, almost to the point that only the right side of the vehicle is shown. But the vehicle was probably a Porsche judging from the wheels and the fact the car says \"Porsche\" in the bottom right corner of the print. There are many other ad examples that show the car being either a Volvo or a Jaguar.\n\nThe ad appears in the Detroit News from September 11, 1946. ( Detroit News, September 11, 1946, page 19 ) The ad was designed by Paul Buhle ( who is now a graphic designer for the New York Yankees and the Washington Redskins ). There is a picture of Joe Louis on the front of the Detroit News. ( http:\/\/www.detnews.com\/ )\n\nThis is another ad by the Detroit News from August 4, 1967. It is for a service station located at 607 West Grand Boulevard. This ad shows a black woman on the left and a white man on the right.

He was joined by Pancho Villa and Orozco and in April the army began approaching Ciudad Juarez \u2013 on the US border \u2013 as they prepared to march on El Paso. The Mexican army entered El Paso on 4 April while a small force was also on its way up the coast towards Los Angeles, headed by Pueblo Bonito.\n\nBy the time the US Civil War ended in 1865, the North and South had both begun looking to Mexico as a possible ally. The North was still reeling from the effects of the Civil War and President Lincoln was increasingly concerned that Germany - who also held large investments in the US - might use Mexico as a stepping-stone for aggression. In 1869 Lincoln set about creating a special commission to be known as The Monroe Commission and its members would travel extensively throughout Mexico to assess military strength and capabilities.\n\nMexico also sought to strengthen its alliance with the United States and had begun in earnest to pay off its debt which would have been impossible otherwise given the nature of the Mexican economy. From 1869 to 1876 Mexico had paid off or had begun repaying loans taken out and this became a priority. At the same time Mexican leaders attempted to improve ties with the US by promoting the creation of a rail-based economic system in which the US would be an anchor country. This would lead to the end of the government monopoly on the system in the 1880's and therefore increase the viability of small businesses who needed roads and rail networks.\n\nUnder the leadership of Porfirio Diaz, the government also began establishing free-market reforms which were popular with the population. These were aimed at reducing corruption and increasing government efficiency. Diaz encouraged the creation of small businesses where possible while also attempting to encourage American and European investments.\n\nDiaz was to lead the government under a constitution which was largely the work of US influence. It was adopted after large-scale protests in 1876 and was said to provide strong representation for all classes of Mexican society. However, the military - who saw any attempt at modernisation as a threat to their monopoly of power remained influential. In October 1879 a plot to overthrow Diaz was revealed and his opponents began looking through his books for any sign of corruption. There was none and Diaz was re-elected for another term in 1881. This came at a time of economic prosperity at home as well as a growing interest by the US government in a closer relationship with Mexico.","token_len":519,"entropy":[6.7189,1.5095,1.0762,1.3559,4.1715,1.5999,1.2068,9.3902,2.1715,0.0003,0.9381,9.2557,6.4658,8.3682,0.852,1.1082,5.8636,1.3211,1.9068,2.9585,3.6484,9.9119,0.8822,1.6101,1.6386,5.2969,0.3289,6.4371,3.7598,0.2453,0.2629,1.6753,9.5685,1.0646,0.0068,3.9859,5.2604,2.7424,3.9709,3.7053,3.9715,9.0837,6.9292,0.0036,0.0005,0.4706,0.1271,6.682,5.0881,0.5245,6.4942,1.6402,1.4872,3.3956,3.0543,3.2683,0.5764,3.5124,1.6445,5.3307,0.253,0.3706,2.5505,3.1262,1.1683,5.148,2.9082,0.021,1.1083,4.1698,1.7606,6.4098,4.3514,3.2,2.3556,3.1598,4.358,2.8543,2.7583,0.0087,4.4675,0.9423,4.3475,5.0753,3.9138,0.7098,2.6393,4.3836,1.7554,3.6512,4.6885,1.318,7.2748,1.4656,0.938,1.3574,0.0163,4.333,1.4533,1.124,0.7953,2.9797,7.476,0.0564,1.6779,0.7458,1.7807,0.4233,1.3653,7.2057,3.5575,0.2073,2.0593,4.3386,4.4412,6.7572,1.5788,1.9873,2.0268,0.8983,2.0752,3.9666,0.7619,1.7065,2.963,1.8166,4.5595,3.8584,0.0484,0.3379,7.1353,0.007,0.3167,2.2259,0.0039,1.1129,5.4432,1.7597,2.0783,5.7488,1.7785,1.9162,8.4958,7.6745,3.4207,5.94,3.95,3.878,8.2709,0.0889,1.3295,2.1767,0.5762,1.2725,3.5356,1.7838,0.4513,0.3404,4.6666,2.8647,0.0056,1.7609,5.0839,0.8622,2.5249,3.2693,2.8441,4.7919,4.8889,2.029,3.5186,0.6727,5.1548,1.0397,0.6303,4.899,4.4117,0.0274,4.7395,8.7568,0.2811,3.3731,4.1855,2.404,3.1829,5.0782,6.7158,2.2699,1.8049,1.0881,3.628,5.673,3.6441,0.7494,4.4548,0.6224,1.3592,0.0002,4.6312,4.5108,6.3105,0.5632,3.7212,0.3955,4.9307,0.0736,0.4923,1.7435,0.0037,1.9441,4.568,3.6846,6.5982,1.9562,1.2479,6.5504,3.154,1.5389,0.879,6.033,2.2986,2.2767,2.2651,5.7195,3.2984,4.7358,0.523,5.1622,0.0213,0.5678,2.7141,1.4332,0.537,5.4261,1.2047,2.0142,0.8846,0.5353,2.2138,2.3875,1.3009,3.6982,1.0424,7.6179,3.3862,4.926,6.6086,0.0181,4.7976,5.2306,1.5269,5.7861,5.7569,5.5162,1.435,5.477,1.5262,4.1401,0.5315,0.658,0.0015,4.2149,3.6415,5.4958,0.0551,4.4895,3.1852,0.2593,0.4474,1.5145,1.9947,4.9491,2.2154,4.7351,0.0102,0.7951,9.3407,4.0358,3.5522,3.9579,1.6936,2.5014,2.3603,1.9699,1.5565,1.2806,1.9383,4.2025,5.3623,5.7201,0.977,2.5691,2.4785,4.4028,0.1303,1.751,5.4736,0.0103,0.4958,7.0543,4.8999,2.1203,1.6596,7.2164,2.9866,2.7236,4.5981,2.582,1.4482,7.2344,4.3064,0.8572,7.588,0.0411,7.6957,2.5807,5.7764,3.7811,7.0686,0.873,2.1285,4.916,0.5432,0.6982,0.0002,5.5877,0.939,2.3758,0.0111,9.4224,1.0983,0.0082,0.0195,5.3273,1.3322,1.2587,4.3302,4.2149,1.6748,4.3381,5.9746,2.8212,2.2564,3.479,2.0541,2.5617,5.1283,0.5078,0.9842,2.9012,0.8616,2.7732,2.9127,3.47,0.0525,2.4639,3.4768,0.6329,3.1048,3.7245,3.5856,0.6748,4.5401,5.1884,1.2235,2.5237,0.0113,3.8964,1.4748,5.2697,4.7648,3.7185,1.4017,5.7052,0.0233,3.209,6.2731,4.949,2.9593,4.152,1.7877,1.5628,0.0001,4.4283,0.0209,2.2369,4.7783,3.4143,0.8427,3.9232,4.6111,3.0345,6.0554,0.953,1.9144,5.7025,4.7333,2.9174,0.0231,4.9443,8.9235,0.9529,2.9337,0.5622,6.0797,4.2356,6.8964,2.4524,0.0031,1.4701,2.04,2.228,2.4666,1.4884,1.8224,7.2577,0.1891,4.5302,5.614,5.8848,1.5676,3.4821,6.3808,0.4793,2.0424,2.4179,0.3962,3.5463,0.5874,1.7416,6.5688,7.6373,3.5971,4.8525,6.6348,2.137,2.1193,7.1837,1.4812,0.4265,1.2289,0.5865,0.3316,0.6852,6.3022,2.0285,0.8484,11.5854,6.2455,1.1537,2.4953,4.6709,0.1801,3.18,2.827,7.4483,1.7397,2.1117,1.2483,0.9293,4.3103,1.3222,3.2719,5.8073,3.8377,6.7241,7.3399,3.8643,4.3473,2.5196,3.85,3.2012,0.1866,3.7673,0.518,5.6535,0.8694,7.3333,2.172,2.3088,0.9782,5.4351,0.2592,0.1055,4.6856,5.0224,0.725,0.9207,0.828,0.9428,0.4113,4.7432,5.606,2.8767,0.5692,0.2087,2.2222,3.4815,4.7118,4.9675,1.4851,3.4457,1.8621,0.0373,1.9828,2.8446,4.618,3.3612,1.0775,1.9209,1.6184,0.1307,4.2715,6.5347,0.677,0.0701,0.2143,0.2774]}
{"id":608,"ended":true,"length":421,"text":"Tennyson adopts aspects of the Ulysses character and narrative from many sources ; his treatment of Ulysses is the first modern account. The ancient Greek poet Homer introduced Ulysses ( Odysseus in Greek ) in the Iliad, describing his return after ten years of servitude to the Trojan, the mighty Achilles. Tennyson begins his Ulysses with a poem-like description of the ship that carries him to England ; this description is more like a narrative. The ship appears as not a vessel for conveyance but a machine : it carries nothing, it carries one. There are no voyagers, there are only passengers.\n\nThe poem is addressed to \"Honeycomb\" - an old man who had been a member of Ulysses' crew earlier in his life and perhaps a more significant character in Ulysses than any of those he encounters in his voyage back to Europe : \" Ulysses here, a hundred years gone, \" he addresses Honeycomb ;\n\n\" A hundred years is a very long time in Ulysses's time,\"\n\na long time for everyone ; but \" a very short time in the long span of my own, or yours ; \"\n\nUlysses's life is filled with long stretches, interludes without reference to time;\n\n\" Ulysses, \" he tells Honeycomb,\n\n\" A man of all lands, of every sea. \"\n\n\" All things to all men \" is the motto of Ulysses ; but of course Honeycomb,\n\n\" knows not many of the ends of things \" ;\n\n\" The little I know that I must ever know \" ;\n\nas Ulysses says\n\n\" I can 't forget the old \"\n\nand Ulysses\n\n\" All I had seen \" ;\n\nbut of Ulysses himself\n\n\" All I have heard \" ;\n\nand of all the \" old \"\n\n\"All I was \" ;\n\nso his is the poem of all men. Honeycomb does not know what else might have happened to him ; he is content to rest on his laurels in the \" old \" kingdom\n\n\" A kingdom, though it be small, to you,\n\nAn empire, though it be so large \".\n\nBut Ulysses has seen and heard things\n\n\" Which were to me unknown, \"\n\nthings that can \" n never die \"--the beauty of the world or the beauty of himself.","token_len":519,"entropy":[9.6754,13.0687,0.0013,11.2416,0.0413,1.5907,5.6817,6.3926,0.0002,5.7509,3.0704,8.356,2.6044,6.2113,4.5535,9.0185,3.7669,6.3309,0.195,5.9779,0.0027,0.0037,1.5162,4.4557,2.2526,5.8351,3.2664,4.5709,2.5188,7.9914,1.8691,2.8733,3.7831,8.2244,0.7412,0.0006,0.0016,3.8745,8.3526,0.0112,0.0041,0.0001,4.9786,2.2357,2.7904,2.8807,1.5702,6.8132,0.02,0.0037,1.4655,5.4619,1.8945,6.7051,5.0728,6.9905,0.4679,1.3945,6.6975,0.0153,1.1963,1.4931,6.317,5.4288,2.9838,6.4203,7.1218,1.3157,9.5585,0.0068,5.0261,1.1327,5.1728,0.0016,0.0023,2.2283,1.3336,3.8607,5.6057,2.3074,2.0699,0.0923,1.1769,6.5877,3.1106,5.3227,1.3509,1.5422,5.911,3.0064,3.6188,4.0398,1.1026,4.654,4.8724,1.4721,3.5964,3.4719,1.6822,5.0767,5.7421,2.562,7.7794,2.0359,3.3093,4.0376,6.9368,0.0477,1.6373,1.1526,7.206,5.9559,1.649,3.8438,6.515,2.4996,3.5743,4.0439,5.4598,4.9832,4.4213,1.2354,2.5251,6.0536,2.1389,1.2971,2.4422,0.5788,1.3648,4.439,1.2926,4.3146,0.0164,1.9914,4.5043,1.783,6.6082,0.2946,4.6103,5.3584,7.2571,4.836,1.9654,6.195,3.714,2.6619,3.6328,1.2637,2.6892,1.6428,2.5816,3.7354,0.0249,4.3991,0.0038,0.0015,1.274,1.8759,8.6589,1.6865,2.0054,0.3853,2.4856,6.4938,3.3616,4.4994,4.3929,1.3615,1.3433,1.5714,0.002,0.0034,2.1404,3.0164,1.3386,4.3608,3.9764,5.0889,1.4691,1.4859,4.2419,5.3894,0.408,3.4001,3.3712,1.7711,5.6144,0.0269,0.0194,6.7752,2.1034,3.9436,6.2557,0.857,5.6585,0.8517,6.781,1.6702,7.9574,8.3969,0.0151,3.7992,6.0575,0.0003,1.1172,5.5797,1.6897,0.106,5.7971,1.2751,3.3307,0.3501,0.1749,3.5421,3.0271,0.0071,0.0006,1.9858,2.2178,2.9696,4.3801,0.0002,4.6826,3.1538,0.356,2.7231,7.4791,3.5201,4.142,2.8464,2.6477,2.4357,3.4418,0.1325,1.2848,2.0909,4.6722,6.0288,0.149,5.2921,4.0416,6.2039,4.7454,8.1574,4.396,1.119,1.9235,0.0005,3.8272,0.0027,0.0013,3.6773,3.1799,1.1472,5.4101,0.027,5.0648,5.0818,3.1818,7.8005,4.1803,1.4371,8.4762,4.7454,0.0681,2.8207,4.1129,3.3083,0.0005,1.5346,4.3886,0.0009,0.001,2.6275,5.0939,2.6566,3.0988,3.1709,0.0007,0.6919,2.7636,0.0009,0.3252,3.5896,4.8392,2.8804,5.4785,5.9956,1.075,2.5655,3.761,4.6958,2.9514,1.047,0.3208,0.0003,2.7031,5.1629,4.049,4.0486,2.6468,1.8694,5.3266,3.0418,1.5102,3.4447,0.481,1.1781,0.0004,0.0008,2.4438,3.9242,5.497,1.8193,5.9573,0.0046,2.5713,3.0519,0.0005,0.0625,7.2722,2.7878,5.3628,2.3822,1.423,6.9256,0.5303,3.3025,3.7348,1.4265,1.3505,0.0003,0.2456,3.9297,6.3748,4.7496,2.0994,4.8472,2.1306,4.9195,5.2205,2.0985,1.3653,3.4929,0.1557,0.0004,8.426,1.8683,0.0004,0.0006,2.8694,5.2833,0.0004,0.2188,2.135,4.1445,7.1007,1.8393,5.5685,2.7736,4.9648,4.5867,2.0339,0.0003,3.5624,3.179,0.0005,0.0008,4.6265,0.0003,0.7725,6.9939,3.3154,6.5421,5.9083,2.3173,5.2254,0.2772,0.0004,4.3136,3.2918,3.6123,0.0006,0.0009,3.2705,1.1467,0.0003,0.2252,3.3367,0.6992,2.0003,2.1042,0.9444,1.2959,0.0645,0.0003,2.5664,0.8755,3.3871,1.4465,5.1256,5.3478,0.8001,0.8173,0.0004,0.7114,8.107,0.7228,5.1913,2.0293,0.7813,0.1061,0.0003,4.7206,5.6562,5.9014,1.8417,3.859,2.1813,3.5696,2.3814,2.0607,8.4339,0.0082,4.4845,0.1812,3.6129,2.9439,6.0288,6.2127,1.3621,1.6091,0.7376,1.3138,3.0184,1.6959,2.1089,5.7891,0.7285,5.8395,2.236,0.8043,0.9406,0.0597,4.018,1.4837,4.8439,1.6886,0.3404,9.1111,4.7779,0.0004,2.0707,5.496,3.5388,3.7434,5.821,1.9605,3.1251,4.1805,0.9053,5.3293,5.2199,1.7768,1.7362,0.0004,6.8077,3.1113,1.1822,1.3927,0.6055,0.438,5.6059,1.6612,8.5223,0.6042,0.0003,3.8216,1.8689,0.0005,0.0007,3.3461,5.0025,3.1003,0.8507,5.012,4.2526,0.0004,1.2664,7.0638,3.6991,3.628,3.2457,4.9536,2.0241,2.5565,1.0847,0.0002,6.0382,1.7318,5.4309,5.0522,6.9773,5.2167,6.6198,1.0723,8.4967,4.8972,7.0484,0.3514,1.5736,2.2983,4.9917,0.8963,2.8539,0.0374,7.9684,1.5963]}
{"id":386,"ended":false,"length":458,"text":"Ransome argues that Wilde freed himself by abandoning the melodrama, the basic structure which underlies his earlier social comedies, and basing the story entirely on the Earnest \/ Ernest verbal conceit. Now, the main character is a kind of \"frenzy\" or \"obsession\", or the reader might say, a kind of a \"madness\" ( Ransome 21 )\n\nIn \"A Woman of No Importance\", Wilde describes the character of Alick as a \"man out of a picture, one of those pictures where the man and woman are very much alike and yet very different because they are not in one anothers way\" ( Ransome 382)\n\nRansome argues that this idea suggests that Wilde had had the idea of a man out of a picture in his mind to some degree for a long time, but that \"A Woman of No Importance\" is the first \"serious\" effort in his attempt to realize this idea in his writing.\n\nIt is not in Mrs. Earnest's power to stop all criticism. That power depends on power of an altogether different kind, the power of wit and humour, or power of cleverness, which she must not have. In her power lies the power of persuasion, the power to win friends where others fail. She can create illusions which will deceive people into admiration and affection. She has an irresistible spell. If she could take her husband at all, she would probably succeed. To this end, she must appear unassailable. There must be no way for critics of the other woman to get round her to their victim. ( Ransome 15-16 )\n\nRansome says that the characters in Wilde's play are so perfectly similar, and their motives and actions so similar, that it is difficult to keep them separated in the mind of the reader. ( Ransome 37 )\n\nRansome argues that the character Alick, who is almost the identical character as in \"The Importance of Being Earnest\", is based on a real person. He was Sir Alfred Hart, a society host and friend of Wilde's who was a friend of Ernest. ( Ransome 382 )\n\nRansome argues that what distinguishes the play from most romantic comedies is its plot structure. Instead of being centered on a situation between two characters, \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" is concerned with the situation between a character and his audience--the relationship between audience and performer.

The Kuiper belt terminates suddenly at a distance of 10 times earth \ufffd s orbit between the planets. The most probable Kuiper planet, or the trans @ @ - @ Neptune is a planet that was probably in its original, more massive form as a \"failed'' star (i.e. a failed planetary body). Because it failed to sustain the nuclear fire necessary to sustain life, it was ejected from its mother solar system. At the time of its escape, and for the first 5 billion years of its existence, Kuiper planet was only 0.5% more massive than Earth but the orbits of the two planets were not aligned. Eventually, as its mass decreased to only 20% of its original value, Neptune was flung at a speed of 36,000 mph toward the outer solar system. It has also been speculated that Neptune was an accretion disk and that Kuiper planet has been a part of our solar system since its creation. The Kuiper Belt is also sometimes referred to as the Kuiper belt or Kuiper belt system, named after Arthur K. Kuiper who first hypothesized how Pluto could exist as a planet (along with others). The Kuiper belt is currently unknown in its origin and is still an active region of study. If it exists as a star at all, it is probably very similar to a failed star whose collapse after a few hundred million years resulted in the asteroid belt. Most space rocks in the Kuiper belt are between 1 and 50 kilometers in diameter (0.6 and 30 miles). There are also some 20 known dwarf planets ranging from 500 to 4000 kilometers in diameter. The most notable of these dwarf planets is Pluto, but most of the Kuiper belt objects (1,500 ) are simply labeled KBOs (Kuiper belt objects), or simply objects in the Kuiper belt. Because of the small size of KBOs, a telescope is needed to resolve details. At 5 to 6 A.M. ET on Oct. 26, 2006 the Hubble Space Telescope discovered four more Kuiper belt objects between 50 and 100 astronomical units (a.u. or AU\ufffds) from the Sun and 5 and 50 AU\ufffds from Pluto. Although these KBOs were located with Hubble they were at a level that can only be obtained by a ground based telescope which will be done shortly and will be reported shortly.","token_len":521,"entropy":[1.9455,11.1861,4.0185,1.5869,2.47,8.3223,12.2486,8.7151,4.0167,11.3316,1.7052,1.9793,8.436,3.1442,8.6592,0.1202,0.0372,1.5259,6.6414,10.1814,1.8108,0.5668,7.8039,10.4061,10.3275,4.4694,0.0152,15.5798,3.9254,1.8553,2.5888,4.2708,0.0345,0.0015,7.7413,10.0288,0.0352,8.1959,1.8124,2.5387,3.0529,0.2142,4.138,4.928,8.6506,13.9792,8.1245,5.3841,5.6924,1.6186,4.7219,1.1958,1.6716,5.046,2.3349,4.5455,0.0097,0.0012,1.6932,3.038,4.5326,3.4837,8.3258,1.6282,3.3866,2.3614,0.2757,4.6366,4.022,3.2148,2.5507,2.5581,2.8056,5.8014,4.1976,2.8782,4.6604,5.5394,5.4186,5.713,0.6172,4.11,1.5445,5.1917,7.2154,2.9429,3.3015,3.1549,4.1043,0.0356,0.0007,0.7845,2.1969,4.0728,4.4091,3.154,1.3938,5.9388,2.6188,5.8379,1.2547,6.778,3.2053,6.6218,5.9879,3.9015,0.4018,3.3656,1.6266,0.8764,1.1191,1.4105,5.5898,1.1994,1.5524,5.6848,7.8997,0.0495,1.6978,4.221,1.445,0.8456,0.7748,0.7896,4.8343,0.6587,6.3283,3.3886,2.4865,2.1638,4.8414,1.5588,0.0536,1.5253,0.2541,0.4271,0.2188,2.4217,0.0046,0.0012,4.2773,1.2891,3.6307,4.9086,0.0251,2.1825,2.1311,5.9494,0.21,0.1602,1.5602,5.6119,4.4874,6.1111,0.451,1.6701,2.7235,1.3406,1.1053,3.3005,3.7061,1.4529,5.6462,0.4559,4.0285,4.1257,3.5891,2.5862,3.2763,4.2983,5.1552,0.6413,0.4493,1.3027,0.5744,4.5399,0.3756,5.2322,1.7601,5.4053,5.4518,1.7839,2.8959,0.5641,6.8369,1.4355,0.3528,3.0097,6.6711,0.6266,5.3853,1.3522,0.0086,0.6803,2.8333,4.745,4.0516,0.2796,2.2725,0.1713,3.1187,1.9366,3.8885,7.1314,0.0319,0.7351,4.0135,1.3614,3.4726,0.0044,0.0007,0.3172,4.1088,1.7412,3.5169,4.6396,0.0481,5.5844,0.925,0.008,1.7891,1.824,3.2986,0.5993,2.1932,2.1571,0.0048,0.0019,3.5266,1.3728,3.0353,5.543,1.0906,0.01,0.0659,0.6149,2.2776,0.2303,0.089,3.3763,3.0727,2.3389,0.6397,0.1152,2.5726,3.8862,2.0148,7.8118,0.6212,8.6302,0.3548,2.6764,0.5312,0.1198,0.0129,2.7975,4.4733,6.1313,6.6483,5.2077,2.8599,3.8037,2.7123,0.3523,1.7362,3.7666,6.7172,0.0711,5.2333,1.8207,1.8728,0.8791,0.0113,0.0019,0.6392,1.1388,4.9163,5.1671,4.1218,3.9481,3.9984,1.5838,2.5824,4.5592,4.122,3.3836,3.5142,0.9656,5.5694,0.5533,4.7412,2.0005,3.4551,3.6687,0.4235,4.6562,5.1305,1.8996,0.2123,0.6764,1.7354,2.4364,4.3817,3.2485,0.1767,2.7693,6.3568,1.6857,5.5026,5.3416,5.5691,2.2775,2.0902,2.5983,1.165,0.019,4.2218,0.0175,1.5716,6.5123,0.8213,2.4278,5.5044,7.7641,3.5697,2.9482,0.5621,0.5812,0.0018,0.0026,0.3817,0.7506,6.433,2.404,1.3418,4.6437,3.0236,0.8691,0.0509,3.1477,3.8832,0.0704,3.1229,3.1083,7.6621,1.806,2.1902,4.0278,0.5021,2.2877,2.5884,5.9106,4.8313,3.887,0.7476,7.1284,1.0552,5.2927,0.5313,5.1127,1.3067,0.2571,0.23,1.1093,1.7147,2.9999,3.8224,1.1586,0.1878,4.2961,0.255,0.5876,3.1814,1.0008,3.9949,4.5512,1.1002,1.0299,2.4246,0.0018,0.0016,0.3607,5.0655,3.8982,5.5016,0.9728,2.3113,8.9418,0.4725,7.2516,6.4621,3.4257,5.6688,1.5296,2.1854,1.7013,1.4551,0.2843,2.6541,1.5495,3.0105,3.3655,4.2585,6.033,2.5345,0.611,0.3739,0.6821,0.0015,0.2546,0.7618,4.859,0.927,1.1017,3.8205,0.5683,0.2264,2.7008,0.0424,0.1559,0.4278,4.3028,6.9385,2.644,1.5545,0.1505,5.7977,7.9971,3.836,4.7573,6.4102,4.2107,3.5893,8.3738,0.1023,0.8221,0.5293,4.5183,0.7747,5.0859,0.558,3.3365,0.2638,3.9825,3.6488,3.2445,0.0536,0.0036,4.248,5.1537,3.7613,0.7278,3.0623,0.0026,0.9994,0.2095,6.4569,4.9699,0.285,1.3125,6.6031,0.0419,0.7839,4.0616,4.4115,3.6765,0.4241,5.5495,1.6974,11.4976,1.0789,0.9005,2.8642,1.1203,2.9343,2.7581,4.2827,4.7411,5.5368,0.5221,0.4891,0.0168,0.2793,4.1143,0.4983,5.0854,2.0822,2.4728,0.1703,0.1257,1.8325,3.7014,5.4906,5.0315,7.9377,0.9452,5.7212,1.7823,6.8413,2.0878,5.0403,2.1667,0.1421,4.9593,1.0191,3.2184,5.6756,3.1446,1.0282,5.3436,4.483,2.1457,8.0353,4.7671,4.4541,1.5851,1.5668,7.2409,4.4357,1.2506]}
{"id":1513,"ended":true,"length":406,"text":"R. C. Kamalakannan was the VFX producer of this film. Magadheera was the first Telugu film in which the position of `` Visual Effects Producer `` was used in the credits. He was previously the visual effects supervisor for Baahubali (2015) and was associate to Anil Ravipudi. Magadheera is also the VFX debut for Vakeel Saab director Sriram Venu.\n\nThere are a total of nine sequences in this film which are the most expensive ever made in Tollywood, and the most expensive Indian film ever made. The largest chunk of the budget and the time was spent on 3D VFX. VFX supervisor Raju Chadunth had said that the Magadheera VFX had the largest share because the budget for the film was very high to begin with. The VFX supervisor has worked on various successful VFX blockbuster films earlier, but this is the first film in his career in which he worked in all departments. He is also known for his expertise in creating effects for period films and action sequences, so the audience would definitely expect his work to be mind blowing with this film.\n\nMagadheera is a fictional account of the life of the legendary warrior and King Magadheera. The film is set against the backdrop of the fictional battle of Ramadevi in south India which took place sometime between 2,600 BCE and 2,100 BCE. Magadheera is based on a Tamil eponymous Sanskrit epic novel written by Kalidasa who was an influential philosopher, critic, and dramatist in 6th century AD. The story is about the legendary warrior-turned-kings Magadheera and Karna. The film stars Prabhas as the fierce and devoted warrior Magadheera and Ram Charan as the powerful and charismatic hero Karna. The roles were first offered to Vinayak Samant and Akhil Akkineni respectively. However, after Vinayak Samant backed of from the film for personal reasons, it was reported that Magadheera would feature Ram Charan in his first dual role.\n\nVinayak Samant who had earlier produced the Tamil hit Mankatha (2010), had his own production house, however he could not sign a deal with Venu. Later he ended up signing a deal with Kamalakannan. Magadheera is the first production of the new production houses of both the producers-- Gopantu Movies and AK Entertainments.","token_len":521,"entropy":[2.7329,5.5403,0.9292,8.7534,4.3284,3.921,10.1377,1.6992,4.795,2.3107,7.9152,6.8969,4.9809,2.5385,4.3718,1.4132,0.8797,10.5416,4.7543,6.6147,4.103,2.4282,0.9846,4.3654,10.2853,0.147,2.3519,4.4337,2.7959,1.6277,9.9572,0.6729,12.3711,12.2311,2.6368,1.1935,5.3458,0.3524,4.4334,2.5974,0.973,5.8124,0.4266,3.6626,0.9945,6.3792,1.2218,3.9037,0.0649,1.1839,1.4111,8.3526,2.9021,0.0181,0.0113,3.6262,6.295,1.231,0.3883,3.7732,8.0766,6.3959,5.508,2.2658,9.2381,10.1716,4.6457,1.9889,3.1639,0.0154,0.0092,0.0028,2.5751,1.6669,1.1304,2.9086,0.0341,12.4149,5.0415,4.05,9.6429,3.3912,6.5994,4.0029,7.7676,9.9691,0.6436,0.369,6.9544,6.8635,1.0982,1.625,0.0184,5.6452,1.0191,2.9611,2.183,0.0041,4.1756,7.0437,1.1658,1.2366,0.3217,3.2918,1.3594,4.4391,3.3313,5.1292,5.09,2.1339,1.622,6.6696,2.0685,2.7406,1.9726,2.2029,2.1431,0.8277,7.165,1.3122,1.2292,0.2039,0.9265,1.3529,6.2364,5.705,0.2089,0.9252,1.2916,5.5379,1.2971,5.5244,4.55,0.4029,0.6084,6.334,1.8315,5.8795,0.0295,1.7496,5.0638,0.8931,4.9104,4.9501,3.3393,9.9905,8.2725,7.7124,4.6728,4.4524,0.6812,1.5583,12.8301,0.0485,0.0225,0.0033,3.0417,0.0331,4.5033,3.407,3.8263,6.609,8.0077,2.143,3.6278,2.1024,1.2798,2.8294,0.3667,4.0462,1.3288,6.1267,1.4811,0.009,0.3144,2.0846,2.9682,0.0415,0.9975,4.208,4.7808,1.0963,4.7843,7.2589,3.1578,0.0983,9.2707,0.7762,9.7094,2.4307,2.7784,1.5367,1.9098,0.4705,0.249,3.4655,1.4135,3.412,1.2152,3.2815,0.2746,0.6645,2.9705,2.4952,4.5057,6.9973,0.624,2.7651,1.9588,1.4753,3.5169,0.3964,0.5845,5.7696,0.4415,3.8283,5.3717,1.3829,8.221,1.2241,2.0722,6.9869,2.1509,2.1596,3.7338,2.4588,6.8982,3.0429,4.8953,3.1544,3.5238,2.3186,0.969,0.4236,8.6983,0.8845,5.47,3.3705,1.5331,0.1102,0.7596,0.0003,5.6169,0.0039,0.0043,0.0029,1.9252,2.2019,8.7159,7.042,0.3662,1.6634,2.1906,0.3073,2.639,4.3414,6.8552,3.9402,7.2407,4.6002,0.1155,0.2795,0.0243,1.9186,1.9612,1.837,1.4504,2.7179,4.4862,0.6618,0.0375,0.0039,1.2248,4.4978,4.7601,1.0705,5.4766,8.6301,2.7415,1.9192,7.0086,1.2644,4.0195,2.1627,0.0101,5.3617,0.9872,3.9707,1.1639,3.9463,3.5098,0.1541,1.3779,0.0036,3.4064,0.8805,0.3612,2.9756,0.0091,0.0034,0.0009,1.5076,4.9922,0.0936,1.8788,5.0912,7.7213,1.5854,8.1756,2.7425,7.8174,2.0853,0.4873,4.259,4.7302,0.2835,4.5457,1.2687,3.0605,4.0451,5.699,2.0461,6.2957,0.8601,0.7832,5.1823,0.0283,0.0074,2.7973,10.7468,0.263,0.3584,2.319,0.2635,1.4265,1.3175,1.8158,3.3058,1.3351,4.2785,0.9711,5.7548,4.2367,0.2398,5.7723,2.9609,3.3452,0.0568,0.0385,0.007,2.1482,5.5654,4.877,2.6602,1.479,2.348,3.5224,5.2588,1.4058,4.8191,8.0723,1.4233,6.6711,2.6109,5.5011,0.9569,2.4066,0.0066,0.007,0.0031,1.818,4.9101,10.4866,0.4819,0.4,1.1349,4.3149,1.6327,4.3617,5.4461,1.3893,0.1073,0.4966,1.3612,7.2923,1.5792,3.9241,3.6097,1.0471,6.1069,0.3924,0.9681,6.5102,4.6013,1.8007,6.34,1.4694,1.2458,5.115,8.4704,7.0421,4.0255,1.0675,4.3029,0.1645,3.6612,4.0863,0.0046,0.0062,0.2669,0.0094,7.9147,8.7295,8.1431,1.7806,3.9633,5.9713,7.3088,0.2075,0.3674,3.6108,0.3123,6.0119,0.1682,3.3622,0.0044,0.0038,0.0019,2.783,7.8439,8.5667,1.2043,0.0022,1.4801,3.056,4.856,9.4945,0.6166,1.286,1.1204,0.0002,3.8062,1.0643,0.0147,0.0046,0.0573,0.0085,5.7797,3.4549,4.914,6.4208,1.1512,3.4463,5.979,5.4524,4.535,7.4165,3.406,4.7275,1.4991,3.1336,3.9576,2.9557,4.468,5.4155,2.8146,5.4271,2.5794,5.1327,0.1709,5.3723,2.2409,1.4736,0.6917,5.8717,1.4726,1.813,5.4804,2.1203,6.8026,0.029,4.1848,1.3572,1.3577,0.1149,6.4174,0.0367,0.02,0.0139,0.0023,1.72,3.8136,0.0071,0.0039,0.0015,2.4951,1.9688,1.7981,5.8725,2.2883,1.4627,4.3449,5.0965,6.6664,2.7886,5.9141,2.4451,5.8204,10.2171,6.8384,3.8278,7.912,4.0172,11.8627,0.772,8.4649,11.4505,0.4174,0.8665,1.0415]}

There have been songs that I thought people would love, but it didn't sound the same as what I thought it would sound like. And sometimes it really surprises you.

It has been shown that swarming behaviour is a response to overcrowding. Increased tactile sensations have been shown to affect locust swarming behaviour. Tactile stimuli can also affect the ability to detect chemicals, especially if they are present as an attractive food-like chemical.\n\nLocusts are capable of complex behaviour which involves cooperative swarming. Group swarming is not a specialised behaviour; for example, if several locusts perceive the risk of predation as greater than the risk of being outnumbered, they will swarm together and fly away from the source of danger.\n\nLocusts are capable of long-range communication that occurs through the infrasonic. In one experiment a female locust flew to a different tree some distance away from the others, but a male locust followed her. The male then remained close to the female until she flew back towards the swarm.\n\nLocusts can change their colour to blend into natural backgrounds. They can also rapidly change the direction of wing motion to blend into wind currents. Locusts can adjust or vary their wing motion to reflect the direction of the wind currents.\n\nLocusts can have chemical defences. A locust secretes a thick paste from glands along its back as well as along its flanks. These sticky secretions block the movement of air over the insect's skin, thus protecting its body from cold. Locusts also secrete a mucous from glands on their sides which reduces the sensation of pain.\n\nIt was observed at the time that swarms of grasshoppers in large meadows or pastures were moving in a direction that was the opposite of the direction of the wind. This seemed to be a significant factor for the reason that this made it so difficult to detect them, and it was suggested that the insect's antennae can detect direction. However, this method is not particularly detailed and is only an approximation for the purpose of orientation.\n\nLocusts can distinguish between similar colours. Another study found that locusts could even distinguish between red and green. So it is clear that they can distinguish colors, though it is unknown whether they can distinguish between identical shades.\n\nLocusts can use their vision to detect threats, which they can either avoid or defend against. Several studies have demonstrated that they can discriminate between the different odours of food by a process of olfactory discrimination or discrimination between chemical cues.","token_len":521,"entropy":[7.6302,3.0064,3.2964,3.2265,8.7408,2.7838,9.9069,0.4352,8.2814,2.6844,1.4504,9.2463,16.8071,6.9848,7.271,9.8843,0.6329,5.9881,2.3513,0.4068,3.8052,1.3672,5.9803,5.221,4.7123,2.3505,0.7206,4.4824,3.0342,0.427,2.6624,0.261,6.5731,0.8848,4.9536,1.3155,2.8449,4.9555,0.1028,7.6729,0.0481,2.2684,7.9879,11.6259,5.4081,4.1291,0.1569,1.8039,0.749,4.3483,8.3438,0.0036,6.0263,0.2223,0.5986,0.8053,10.64,0.0575,4.1414,2.7295,2.4237,2.1622,2.0777,3.6191,1.2072,3.048,9.6299,2.9857,2.9524,3.5019,1.3185,0.4677,2.6221,5.2082,3.7015,5.5903,5.6836,5.1761,3.1186,4.7435,0.5896,2.3616,0.0034,5.2228,0.0002,0.8464,1.1343,5.6861,0.006,5.8376,2.704,3.7838,3.7662,7.5419,7.1004,0.1268,2.1142,7.4778,2.0692,0.0974,1.4979,4.4482,2.4879,6.5757,3.1875,1.2651,3.8086,4.4619,0.4596,0.367,4.2972,4.8187,5.1795,0.0074,0.0603,10.339,1.96,9.6698,0.1746,4.9023,0.0093,5.2936,4.3077,0.6287,2.1779,1.5898,0.1179,2.8235,7.0883,0.6896,1.1235,1.0446,2.0416,0.4881,1.7946,7.7215,1.6717,2.2744,1.7267,6.3741,1.3688,3.5111,0.3226,1.7733,0.0002,2.6874,0.0004,0.6731,1.2307,4.051,0.0067,5.3607,0.6221,2.1092,3.6398,4.6596,4.1239,2.7731,2.5858,7.5306,5.4383,0.2193,6.4804,3.0972,4.6791,3.8679,3.2599,4.2488,1.4078,0.0122,4.5243,3.0825,1.3511,4.4837,6.237,8.2591,2.0241,0.5927,0.9528,0.8414,6.457,1.834,2.3921,4.4425,0.9645,1.3031,0.0045,4.0769,1.2095,1.4903,1.3892,1.4853,4.2475,7.0473,3.39,0.6387,0.3187,2.3041,2.6905,1.0675,3.5794,2.6642,3.9447,0.8592,7.1416,0.8234,1.8056,0.0002,2.574,0.0006,0.467,2.0882,5.5133,0.8079,3.5164,2.238,5.7764,2.246,6.3779,5.7628,1.5605,2.7295,1.4058,1.4978,7.8577,1.5384,3.3591,3.6151,0.5923,8.3884,3.204,2.55,3.7062,1.3175,6.7765,4.9376,0.4452,3.0674,0.0003,0.2579,1.4334,6.0204,6.2971,5.9421,0.7662,3.8549,3.6587,1.1949,5.4797,1.6046,3.2879,0.4076,1.5144,0.1624,4.7115,0.7973,0.9335,0.0002,1.9966,0.0003,0.3311,1.6575,4.2949,8.2106,6.4402,2.4132,3.0478,2.4746,0.0098,9.9796,0.167,0.9558,6.884,7.551,4.1147,6.0549,5.395,0.8178,2.0816,4.7958,2.5745,0.0027,7.0494,0.2134,5.0316,0.5785,0.6356,2.6499,7.1843,7.2694,0.036,4.5357,1.2132,3.5619,0.0294,5.4676,5.9838,0.8445,3.7874,0.8255,4.6775,1.6792,3.8381,3.3703,2.7638,1.4634,0.4372,5.0109,1.2454,3.2023,0.0003,0.0837,1.2544,4.5579,0.0013,1.4144,3.8891,0.9138,4.2158,3.1839,1.289,1.2268,4.7546,2.7054,5.4878,0.7338,5.9911,0.028,3.6882,0.8975,0.7436,0.0002,4.5103,4.2687,4.2769,5.6064,1.7713,2.7667,0.4011,4.385,1.8852,0.8342,8.2979,0.0007,0.0181,3.5562,5.6771,8.9795,0.8694,4.9292,7.6886,0.0582,1.5793,7.2521,2.1596,1.7406,3.0453,1.7268,1.3957,5.3882,1.3674,0.3269,0.8216,1.1347,1.0888,0.6099,0.7315,0.5956,1.8112,6.6799,0.2629,1.0978,1.748,5.7412,4.119,2.8809,1.2468,8.6138,0.1601,4.7334,7.9175,1.7977,4.4997,2.3089,0.7767,1.5052,4.3211,3.4561,1.8529,2.6848,0.9309,2.9893,0.239,1.5878,4.2362,2.2382,6.3932,0.1766,5.7138,2.6814,6.6501,2.3232,3.0405,0.1647,1.5248,6.0739,2.2728,0.9702,4.3095,7.0867,1.3318,1.9807,3.3251,4.3548,2.2746,4.0772,1.6958,3.7981,0.4811,12.0456,1.2266,0.5727,0.0002,2.4718,0.0005,0.2586,1.988,6.0168,0.6035,7.2764,4.2246,1.9829,6.1931,2.8818,2.6975,0.1085,2.477,0.0011,0.0774,2.8703,5.7562,0.9369,0.1789,3.6086,0.378,1.3539,1.6458,6.0711,2.5028,1.0599,4.5686,0.1498,2.1406,1.9412,1.7398,7.1978,3.1803,4.0773,2.2529,0.4873,3.7236,1.277,1.2709,1.1038,1.0942,1.0099,6.9069,3.7806,0.9477,0.5919,0.0003,2.1191,0.0003,0.1651,1.661,3.7369,1.8091,5.0504,0.3082,1.7451,5.9601,2.4768,3.7595,2.9334,1.6804,5.6345,2.9016,0.2042,4.9546,0.4342,0.2372,6.2029,1.1887,0.2915,2.8794,0.2807,2.9835,0.556,4.3175,0.2087,3.4482,3.0467,7.5556,0.1856,0.4921,4.3861,4.7029,5.108,2.8397,2.9501,5.1089,0.101,0.5521,3.3536,4.5987,5.8543,2.3815,5.431,3.5526,0.6117]}
{"id":4313,"ended":true,"length":449,"text":"The threat of French attack continued throughout the 15th century. Instead of relying on murage grants, more funds for the town walls were directly granted by the king in 1400, including an increase in the town guardsmen. The first recorded cannon in the town was fired in 1411. A large part of the town wall was constructed during the rule of Henry V (1420-1471), who also constructed the gatehouse.\n\nBy the time of Henry VIII's reign (1509-1547), the town had two gates, the East gate (originally built in 1250 and called the Southgate Street ) and the West gateway (originally built in 1230 and called the North gate ). The East gate was built where the previous gate was, but the previous gateway was never destroyed as it had already been replaced in 1270. The West gate was replaced in 1522 by a third castle gate which was probably destroyed in the English Civil War or in the 1640s.\n\nDespite the English Civil War (1639-1651), the town was not laid siege to by Parliament forces or the King's troops. However, in February 1646 the siege of Bridgwater was lifted. At this time the town was in a state of siege ( which means that the English were within firing range of the town but not of the gates ), with an estimated 400-500 Cromwellian troops camped at Southgate. However, as the nearby army of Sir Hugh Mercer was advancing towards Bridgwater, the Cromwellian commander decided to withdraw to Taunton to allow the Bridgwater garrison free-passage into a besieged Taunton. The town gatehouses in Taunton and Biddikin were therefore spared.\n\nIn 1647, King Charles II and most of the Royalists retreated to France to escape the ongoing civil war. At this time the town hall was destroyed, with no trace remaining of the gatehouse.\n\nBridgwater remained in civilian hands until 1680, when the town was granted military status. At this time the gatehouses once again became part of the defensive walls. The walls which now surround the town centre were built at this time. A new town hall was built in 1683. The present town hall was built in 1895 and contains many of the original documents which belonged to the medieval town. The town gatehouse was refurbished in 1987 and houses a gift shop and museum. In 1988\/89 the Southgate Street gatehouse underwent much renovation, with the gatehouse still closed to the public.","token_len":522,"entropy":[8.8182,0.877,8.9679,5.2387,5.4459,4.1182,0.5236,7.7443,1.0385,0.4028,1.1567,7.8449,0.2586,6.1633,0.209,11.9433,9.2913,12.2168,1.0403,7.0137,6.0395,4.8408,2.4841,8.5169,7.9551,0.8849,8.4456,6.2266,1.8864,0.6559,3.2394,4.0758,9.3836,1.6754,5.0705,3.5237,3.7842,0.3908,0.8148,4.6717,5.9712,4.2594,1.4356,1.8265,4.3334,6.2106,7.3887,4.5747,1.2515,1.1497,0.8218,1.975,2.1351,1.6566,4.9046,1.3737,3.9119,3.3666,2.6565,0.0106,0.1956,0.9931,3.7358,0.5182,4.0169,3.3615,0.433,8.2099,0.0185,3.9001,3.7918,3.0338,0.7929,4.2572,0.2608,0.183,5.2364,0.8738,1.336,3.7478,4.5457,1.422,7.1479,1.8937,1.9619,1.47,0.01,4.13,0.9601,2.6191,0.7002,1.5507,1.9874,1.6145,1.5852,2.9197,5.1077,1.4397,0.56,0.7474,4.9223,0.1151,0.9515,0.9284,2.4379,5.8707,3.5527,1.4788,2.732,7.965,2.8707,2.4138,6.2923,0.0171,1.4191,1.109,3.2277,3.8574,3.2585,5.8254,1.4362,5.1478,2.9522,9.0711,6.2739,0.0991,0.1693,0.3635,5.9197,0.2699,0.2578,0.0023,0.2688,0.2,1.2149,4.0081,1.09,0.1869,0.1303,2.3952,3.403,0.7196,1.2386,2.6927,0.3472,0.9382,1.9028,7.2727,1.1611,7.3794,1.4071,1.1512,2.707,2.0668,1.6149,6.5935,5.4586,0.5417,4.2262,5.527,4.2699,1.637,2.7775,4.0735,0.1046,4.1212,2.1752,1.67,4.226,0.6754,1.1487,1.5592,0.2873,0.5308,4.7273,0.8706,1.791,4.1972,1.0486,0.9696,5.3783,8.4523,3.4442,2.9331,0.8677,5.7581,4.0554,0.9638,2.4941,6.2132,1.7957,0.0051,5.939,2.2235,1.0989,4.856,3.7338,0.365,0.6658,1.1457,0.0002,4.9512,0.7932,4.595,2.4536,0.0029,2.1644,1.4085,3.4377,0.2552,1.8757,3.5822,0.277,0.7262,0.8314,1.8442,2.2353,8.0398,4.9846,0.9386,4.9165,9.0194,9.2065,4.0795,1.9875,3.4767,1.2945,2.6741,0.9972,3.1033,0.07,2.9063,5.8119,0.7304,3.5001,2.1245,4.4325,1.3336,9.8149,0.8923,1.8412,1.1733,4.6559,2.1357,4.73,2.2091,0.4412,1.3165,1.1872,0.6422,3.156,1.6685,0.7601,0.0043,1.3894,4.3555,8.9027,3.1252,1.6493,1.3987,2.494,2.339,6.253,5.4985,0.0477,0.4178,0.5859,2.2711,6.1029,2.4482,2.9678,0.5115,6.523,2.5735,3.0644,4.1542,1.8323,5.4386,3.1062,0.253,8.7279,0.0335,2.331,1.6325,7.9954,0.1021,2.1097,8.7664,0.303,1.8888,4.5228,0.1395,3.6853,1.0938,7.5626,5.5225,4.3264,5.0713,4.7559,7.2428,1.7232,2.8644,2.4053,0.6921,0.0203,0.0062,0.6967,0.9328,3.4353,0.0012,0.5593,4.9423,4.0701,0.2601,3.4887,2.0097,6.2122,2.8816,0.0078,2.6486,4.3568,0.9265,11.1855,0.0218,0.0196,1.0555,8.0597,4.588,8.2143,4.7834,4.0195,5.1616,6.0863,6.5221,0.023,0.0004,1.9291,1.7262,2.298,7.3332,6.3372,3.7532,1.8103,0.0015,0.0001,2.9927,6.7304,5.0743,9.6572,5.1348,0.9195,7.0251,7.1824,1.9448,0.8776,0.0002,2.5176,1.1115,2.9688,0.8581,3.8195,2.1725,1.42,4.0343,6.8937,0.1473,1.0989,4.3306,4.0087,5.3597,0.6219,6.7682,1.8836,5.0664,0.7695,6.2873,2.3185,0.0102,0.8772,4.3874,1.5194,0.2532,1.2049,1.8595,6.561,0.673,3.8414,1.9491,2.6735,3.9876,6.3629,3.7568,0.2432,0.553,3.2286,0.2572,0.9166,1.735,0.0002,4.9444,0.3996,0.0308,0.0181,4.4217,1.9902,8.9414,1.6689,0.4653,1.7042,4.1144,0.9207,0.2118,1.1722,2.3968,0.6343,4.2915,4.9208,2.5085,1.6317,4.0737,0.4573,0.2029,1.0496,6.5725,2.4515,8.2103,0.2549,2.6411,2.7759,0.0017,0.3064,6.782,2.6396,1.9561,1.6901,3.466,5.5263,4.2558,2.1442,0.4932,0.8628,5.6299,0.8933,2.6453,3.6658,2.7317,0.1242,2.4322,4.1224,3.2537,3.7881,0.7223,0.586,0.6998,1.3227,1.0983,2.8632,1.9652,1.6152,7.1383,0.8831,0.151,1.331,1.224,1.3195,8.6302,1.6412,5.2402,4.4989,1.8507,0.0428,3.669,8.6658,2.2979,5.7432,0.0253,0.3313,5.1468,1.3939,1.327,1.5083,2.6775,4.2949,0.5319,0.9935,6.6385,0.0026,0.4615,4.7216,1.5144,6.1891,1.6792,8.7099,0.2821,1.8187,3.8218,0.6347,3.6585,3.9483,7.6007,0.4293,1.0245,7.6765,0.1585,0.4456,1.7616,0.2199,6.7998,5.7503,1.8433,1.5833,1.9738,1.3306,3.7787,0.6779,4.0054,6.6708,1.9816,0.8313,0.1403,1.2552]}

As the story evolved, the script was turned into an 11-hour screenplay that they presented to Hollywood producer David Marconi, who agreed to finance and produce the film on-budget, if they would only agree \"to change it a bit\". They cut down the story down to three hours and 20 minutes.\n\nIn 2007, director Rob Marshall was attached to direct this film. However, the script kept evolving and on May 6, 2008, director David S. Goyer was hired as the new screenplay writer and the film was pushed back to July 9, 2009. Goyer has stated that this film will be set after all three Dead Man's Chest and At World's End installments. The cast was re-cast with a few new additions. On November 18, 2009, Deadline broke the news that Johnny Depp had signed on to star as Captain Jack Sparrow. The next day, Ewan McGregor was also signed on to co-star as Davy Jones. Jack Whitehall has joined the cast of the film as Henry Turner, a young man from Georgia who, despite being a member of the Royal Navy, falls in love with the heartthrob of the town.\n\nIn addition to this, it was announced in August 2009 that Orlando Bloom would reportedly not return to the franchise due to creative differences with producers over the script of this film. Bloom was quoted as saying, \"It was a good thing to do but I needed to grow up a bit. When we finished we were all grown men\". He went on to express interest in returning for the fifth and final film in the series.\n\nIn late 2010, Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz made their own choices to leave the franchise. Javier Bardem has since stated that he did not have \"an interest\" in reprising his role as Captain of the Flying Dutchman and that he felt it would have been a \"cop out\" and a \"distraction\" from the upcoming movie.\n\nIn November 2010, the movie's official title was released as Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, and the film was slated for release on May 22, 2011. Due to the death of Prince Charles on April 9, 2011, it was later rescheduled to March 10, 2011, and, because of the death of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands on April 30 of that year, it was moved back in a third time to July 2.","token_len":526,"entropy":[7.4928,4.136,9.3386,9.9131,2.0856,7.7885,9.0512,4.6512,0.1011,0.0168,5.2704,7.7837,0.9585,7.3122,2.5635,0.5767,0.1561,2.7762,8.1463,7.3944,0.188,0.0172,3.2155,4.1961,0.2173,3.7978,0.6924,1.1494,2.4345,0.8828,0.2104,1.4545,5.5829,1.9114,0.7919,4.5657,2.0527,2.5919,4.4292,0.6258,1.4576,3.5106,1.7634,4.7431,1.7604,2.2816,6.2783,0.2535,2.8238,6.5856,2.4835,5.7464,6.8119,0.6151,5.9202,6.1041,3.4424,7.6167,7.9796,1.833,0.5965,3.7591,0.1857,5.3595,3.0632,2.3588,0.8967,0.9177,3.7963,3.9784,5.3231,2.2271,6.2014,2.2341,3.192,3.5586,5.3104,7.6185,0.4875,6.0377,2.9916,2.8255,2.3277,1.9117,3.3068,6.4607,3.7687,0.8092,3.8289,3.4823,0.141,3.2273,2.0682,1.3133,6.2155,0.1002,2.4051,1.3292,0.0025,2.5231,4.5297,0.2301,4.3939,5.0782,3.2845,3.1146,6.1489,0.0841,0.7353,5.1602,0.9849,1.8276,3.8177,0.042,2.0057,2.1808,7.2831,4.9811,1.2018,6.0443,3.9287,3.4338,0.5918,1.4798,0.256,4.763,3.2971,5.3429,0.3761,0.4944,0.0975,1.7884,2.6771,2.5464,1.4914,3.1636,4.9698,1.0952,2.3999,2.8154,2.5108,0.4517,6.2524,0.8532,0.7142,3.7561,3.9257,0.521,1.2708,0.4817,4.4703,0.0008,4.219,2.99,0.3989,3.7602,2.172,2.2284,1.1481,4.9571,4.2649,5.7715,3.57,2.0944,0.1131,0.0725,0.0381,2.5375,0.4571,0.0041,0.0014,0.0014,5.7725,1.2974,2.5098,5.8487,2.7683,4.5129,0.4191,3.7267,3.9709,3.0311,4.3639,2.0267,2.1692,2.4063,5.1357,3.5055,3.5881,0.0719,1.5694,0.1247,6.1617,4.5457,0.2241,0.3198,0.3855,7.7585,0.2378,0.0001,2.3657,2.2748,0.4888,0.7677,1.904,1.4199,5.3776,2.3321,0.6945,1.8352,2.2134,4.4005,0.1461,0.1696,6.8425,1.0878,0.0021,2.2277,3.7043,3.3374,0.5089,0.8834,4.3267,0.0372,0.0793,1.6005,7.0006,0.4884,0.2375,0.9603,6.1885,8.1755,8.8958,4.0332,5.8061,0.6566,0.276,2.4018,1.3926,0.6964,1.5012,5.9119,8.8703,1.319,1.95,3.0603,2.0905,3.4807,5.8741,0.4367,4.3776,3.3193,1.1696,1.6128,3.2522,0.0061,0.4772,4.4,2.5191,0.319,5.52,0.7565,0.1029,0.0254,2.4171,8.6406,2.3298,0.0005,2.9962,0.7649,6.3412,0.8407,1.5924,0.0002,2.1748,3.045,0.2673,3.5305,1.0194,4.1264,0.9179,1.7642,2.8432,3.0818,1.9433,0.0693,9.5678,0.1569,1.0325,8.0454,6.149,1.6682,0.7886,0.8459,3.3532,3.1707,0.0105,8.2151,0.5529,1.6784,6.1901,6.1115,1.2558,3.288,4.2644,4.7318,0.9154,0.2317,2.8479,1.8356,5.8288,0.7237,0.088,1.1163,0.0724,2.4116,1.6531,1.4762,4.0822,2.6576,1.9511,3.2537,3.7423,1.2822,5.5896,0.5313,6.7633,1.2753,3.7709,1.9413,1.5015,4.4787,2.9109,4.2882,3.7052,1.7778,3.1334,5.2524,2.8232,5.8923,2.9575,3.1019,0.0146,0.112,5.2701,7.3091,0.0627,1.6446,2.2756,1.5382,4.387,2.9853,0.0964,2.7194,1.2994,0.2565,0.7365,1.1955,0.7564,0.0002,1.8867,4.158,1.8024,0.1072,8.4704,0.0152,0.0,2.776,9.0477,0.0424,0.0037,4.3396,1.2214,3.7403,8.0517,1.8381,5.995,0.4315,0.9275,1.212,4.4054,0.7777,0.0006,3.3981,3.4175,1.8348,0.5474,0.5205,3.5425,0.1086,3.6135,4.4521,3.1732,2.9978,0.6567,0.0448,3.834,0.4541,0.6199,0.2435,0.658,1.9762,6.7829,0.2226,5.4511,1.2227,0.0121,2.4565,1.8049,0.5114,3.4546,2.4799,1.541,2.814,0.4686,2.0853,1.7091,8.6894,1.4145,0.6067,3.2506,2.3733,0.5921,5.5431,0.5452,0.7819,1.5864,0.5208,6.2036,3.5877,0.3672,1.4034,0.0002,1.5685,2.3536,1.3429,0.0723,2.5456,4.4914,2.2063,3.5824,4.5046,0.4274,3.2744,2.0668,5.7404,0.1948,0.0344,0.0019,0.2156,1.9479,0.0014,0.0081,0.0009,2.1855,2.2948,1.9157,1.4091,1.2501,5.7761,0.9223,0.4069,0.6468,1.9939,3.7527,0.1042,0.2425,0.2229,5.3232,0.0085,1.3626,6.5831,0.0781,6.1708,3.5392,2.5269,3.0288,3.5978,0.102,1.0433,0.0878,2.8307,0.331,4.4891,5.5119,0.1663,0.0002,0.8505,3.3861,3.7301,0.1107,1.2154,2.1956,1.9168,6.3923,5.4581,0.3608,1.0523,3.0857,0.0492,5.5835,5.0471,0.2068,0.6121,1.0359,0.5255,0.8882,1.3136,4.2129,6.426,0.3347,0.087,0.0403,1.1022,0.2353,3.8506,2.3266,4.762,4.8706,5.9636,3.2665,1.3719,3.0524,3.3359,3.1943]}
{"id":2319,"ended":true,"length":464,"text":"In August 2014, film director Sathish Paul filed a copyright infringement suit against the makers, saying that it had similarities to his script titled Oru < unk >, written in 2013.\n\nThe suit alleged that the makers of Ramleela, a Telugu movie, based the film on his script, while the latter has not even watched the film. As the matter is ongoing, the police were now investigating into the allegations.\n\nIn the course of filing the case, the director had alleged that, one of the producers, Ram Charan, had called him into his office, where he and five of his associates were present, and said that he was working on a screenplay for a film set against the backdrop of village life.\n\nThe producers wanted it to be based on a short story as they had already cast its heroine Kajal Aggarwal as a heroine, the suit stated. Aggarwal was the daughter of Bollywood actor Prakash Aggarwal, the complaint had alleged. It had alleged that the duo met in the latter\u2019s hotel room.\n\nThe suit alleged that the two directors discussed the script for Ramleela for sometime before they left. Then, the makers called Paul and he narrated the story, as described earlier.\n\nThe suit claimed that the short story was written in Tamil as well, but the makers had only taken it into Telugu and changed the names of the places.\n\nThough nothing could be verified immediately, one of the producers of \u2018Ramleela\u2019, Ram Charan, refuted the allegations as baseless.\n\nHe expressed shock at the complaint filed against himself and a few others by the director. The producer said in a statement that Paul had actually worked with him, and made a proposal for this film project.\n\nHe said that this script was completely different from the one that Sathish Paul has written as there was no similarity.\n\n\u201cWe have filed an exparte application of \u2018no injury to our party\u2019, meaning that if the matter reaches the Court, we will not require the intervention of the court even if the said short story was similar. We are still trying to gather information,\u201d said Chiranjeevi, one of the producers of the film.\n\nIn the complaint, Paul, a resident of Tirupathi (Andhra Pradesh), has sought an immediate direction to the makers to modify, change, delete and render the story which allegedly infringed his script. Paul had also sought an immediate cease of production of the film.","token_len":526,"entropy":[8.063,3.0371,0.1415,10.696,1.6077,6.1227,8.1769,3.8573,7.4412,6.4656,0.4361,4.7176,0.8471,1.1465,0.2101,2.1104,3.9278,5.045,3.4248,1.2695,4.3861,2.6567,11.336,0.5231,3.7499,5.739,5.1511,7.3631,7.6215,9.3239,10.5856,5.443,6.2316,3.7334,4.5748,1.7291,5.4113,0.8786,1.4263,0.0007,1.7864,2.5546,2.988,0.128,1.0546,4.5911,1.6733,9.7649,9.3689,8.5362,2.4446,2.5217,6.5801,0.0469,3.4054,1.3087,7.428,8.8908,1.7424,0.2698,3.6896,1.9299,1.0626,6.6676,4.2961,5.1728,3.2171,3.6372,4.4979,8.2981,0.6461,1.0255,0.7355,5.4525,2.6613,5.8295,2.1726,3.4414,0.1256,1.1918,5.9927,4.5436,5.9829,1.6144,6.4518,0.6203,3.3877,0.5383,0.3607,0.0003,2.6628,2.3789,5.1634,0.0005,3.4772,0.3075,2.2554,0.184,1.0748,3.2784,3.0223,3.2587,0.1142,4.0518,6.9336,2.4416,0.4905,2.5848,1.7975,4.2843,7.7667,0.2253,0.6605,1.0714,4.9951,1.0316,5.7999,0.5223,0.5637,2.7557,3.5742,0.4302,4.9448,5.3407,3.7275,0.1974,3.0865,1.0209,2.1054,1.3413,1.317,2.2562,0.8574,1.5077,1.542,4.1643,0.4061,1.1404,3.2478,0.9917,1.8583,1.389,5.3249,4.5927,1.0356,0.6238,0.0024,8.7567,1.6049,0.6665,0.5466,0.0002,1.6987,4.6026,6.79,6.391,0.3961,0.334,3.6716,0.0623,1.8575,5.2936,1.0127,5.6626,2.9223,2.0644,2.8268,5.6738,6.1449,5.3729,4.5021,5.3035,3.1638,8.2001,0.0755,0.0125,1.6718,1.144,6.0777,2.6731,2.5197,1.6811,3.0718,0.1235,6.6184,0.0013,0.0014,1.8306,2.9527,2.8473,0.0194,5.0643,2.0614,1.2496,4.5773,1.5497,0.0071,3.2436,0.0056,0.0136,1.0095,2.5306,3.4553,5.2569,1.1789,0.1045,5.1437,2.1921,1.9614,0.0554,1.1285,6.2625,6.081,2.0959,1.7768,7.3321,17.4712,7.1267,3.4283,4.9492,0.3941,3.6549,0.3686,0.0002,1.3566,3.0883,2.9325,0.0415,1.0513,3.1467,5.1834,5.5943,0.8685,1.779,2.9182,3.0988,0.4746,0.0047,3.8396,7.3362,2.2662,2.6213,4.1338,2.907,4.9984,0.5231,1.6633,6.0133,3.6165,6.0347,1.2614,5.0073,8.2486,0.4549,2.5734,2.0627,4.7214,5.4303,5.4173,1.3295,0.8706,0.0002,1.3265,2.6472,2.3452,0.0486,1.0147,6.7756,0.394,1.3195,2.2024,1.3674,3.9878,3.7906,1.1964,1.9978,2.6714,1.6864,4.0286,2.0808,4.6762,5.731,2.454,2.5731,7.1194,0.0621,2.1958,5.9137,1.0736,4.1775,0.5855,0.4576,6.2043,2.3418,0.8251,0.0002,6.1075,6.4926,4.4764,0.0282,3.3002,6.9325,0.3642,4.8097,1.7362,0.0923,1.3253,2.1292,12.4976,6.5202,2.5832,0.4232,0.0034,2.9503,0.3786,4.0372,2.985,2.9028,0.0029,0.1585,7.7996,0.1403,1.2781,4.5691,3.512,0.46,0.6477,0.0001,3.0486,6.6863,4.1062,1.1853,0.1796,3.771,1.5375,0.9484,8.5834,0.8988,4.9859,2.1793,1.4251,2.9146,0.5603,3.4599,1.0332,4.219,1.7375,1.2191,4.728,0.6591,0.6077,0.7751,6.4206,1.1676,5.8428,4.6638,1.8522,1.3099,3.5972,1.2811,6.0864,2.278,4.385,1.608,5.0796,1.1992,5.3998,0.8188,0.5306,0.0002,2.6109,1.1545,0.4715,3.9501,5.476,0.9658,6.7734,2.0875,0.4979,0.8336,2.0286,2.0896,6.9262,0.2161,0.0055,0.218,4.074,2.0345,4.7291,7.128,1.0033,0.5384,4.2213,1.8327,0.6431,0.0001,6.4539,5.6208,5.9724,1.5766,3.3844,1.9993,9.5305,10.9894,6.315,4.0159,6.595,0.3498,8.6777,9.4279,1.51,4.3747,6.3989,1.2713,1.199,2.3274,7.2476,0.6536,3.2053,1.7699,4.4062,5.3141,0.9294,3.2171,0.7956,1.4467,0.4222,2.76,7.4668,2.0537,6.3465,0.0219,0.7041,2.792,5.3957,0.6361,1.2741,8.2719,8.475,0.2755,2.7866,7.1011,1.9914,3.1822,2.0205,4.1472,3.5571,0.1045,4.5782,2.047,3.3502,7.8961,6.2428,3.3112,5.395,4.0438,1.2601,2.8637,1.9682,2.3766,4.6377,0.0174,0.0933,1.9831,0.5296,1.2429,1.556,0.2581,0.2639,0.0002,3.2738,1.754,4.3774,0.5908,1.9808,3.6501,2.9446,3.394,0.044,5.8594,1.3342,4.0052,5.0669,8.4796,0.2907,0.0192,0.577,3.2309,5.6599,3.1337,4.266,7.6049,1.5839,0.8947,6.1709,2.0291,7.1913,5.2993,3.1383,1.7752,3.4866,1.7479,6.3512,0.6917,3.551,5.5718,6.0814,5.6281,1.1119,2.3108,3.341,0.6926,4.9326,2.0061,2.3241,2.7103,1.4997,0.9806,6.059,3.878,1.7525,1.3365,0.3136,1.3678,1.1158]}

Soon, the trio made a commitment to Ferris-Gibson to make their film \"as soon as possible.\" Producer Mark Ordesky, who had previously worked with Aniston and Grey on their previous projects, described the team, \"We don\u2019t make movies and sell movies\u2014we make movies and promote movies.\" The first meeting took place in early April 2009.\n\nOn July 9, 2009, The Hollywood Reporter announced that The Crazies and the X-Files creator Chris Carter was to write and direct the film. The project was previously planned to come out in 2009 with Rob Reiner to direct. By December 2009, screenwriter Carter was in negotiations for the project, and had signed a multi-year deal to write and produce the film.\n\nThe film also starred Amanda Peet, Chris Parnell, Ed Harris, and Kevin Bacon.\n\nThe first trailer and posters for the film were revealed on May 5, 2010\n\nOn June 24, 2010, director Rob Epstein, producer Jennifer Aniston and Brad Grey announced that the film had been delayed. In a joint statement, they wrote, \"For all of you that have been waiting on this film... we want to update you on the project... We just aren't able to make the July 6th release date. We will continue to produce and push the film to an airdate next year.\" The exact reasons behind the delay were not given. The film was scheduled to take over the July 6, 2010 spot left by The Dilemma.\n\nOn March 5, 2011, the official Facebook page for The Crazies revealed that Rob Carter was no longer writing and producing the film. The group of cast and crew remained silent amid rumors of a director change or the film being abandoned until June 21, 2011, when the group confirmed that Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris remained set as producers, as well as director Jonathan Milott.\n\nThe film's name was officially announced for the first time on February 19, 2012, when it was revealed that the film would be called The Crazies. The same day, a press release from Paramount Pictures, distributed by Summit Entertainment, revealed that the film would be PG-13 after being rated R previously, and it would premiere on February 11, 2013.","token_len":526,"entropy":[7.3088,3.5011,1.0622,5.339,6.2508,2.1358,1.3868,5.8789,1.1649,5.0896,7.5625,2.4762,11.6037,0.5899,0.947,2.1396,4.1934,2.2346,7.5903,3.7708,10.0578,1.509,4.6697,10.6731,1.038,4.0338,2.4815,2.3429,4.1954,1.8686,0.8802,1.5686,0.325,5.5857,1.1091,2.3085,1.8783,8.4225,9.4883,2.8415,3.823,3.009,1.4018,0.9032,2.7519,4.8479,0.6421,3.3254,6.903,0.2974,4.9298,7.9644,2.5935,0.0001,0.3782,4.8818,5.9016,0.6353,6.9464,2.0709,1.2584,5.0314,4.4923,1.5325,4.6715,0.3355,7.8453,0.0,4.4839,0.4583,0.0147,0.0101,4.0148,2.8662,4.0289,1.0126,4.4263,4.4568,3.2397,0.0131,0.1545,0.8637,8.7856,6.0797,8.0646,7.7559,2.235,1.6636,0.45,1.6725,2.5298,0.5415,0.9599,4.3605,0.0003,1.4196,0.2703,0.8403,3.14,4.4643,1.7719,0.2138,6.0579,0.6538,5.2642,5.2322,1.4904,2.4629,5.1174,16.2032,9.6737,0.3286,4.814,2.3397,4.5153,8.2338,2.6829,5.0254,0.4186,1.3404,0.911,1.1775,4.3122,0.3871,1.0413,2.5801,4.3644,5.6859,1.7949,0.0027,1.0504,2.7932,3.7794,2.5657,1.5483,1.5132,0.0009,3.7869,2.9961,3.267,0.2625,0.6948,0.0358,4.1426,2.9726,0.0029,3.9227,0.5569,3.3556,6.7616,3.6167,1.1676,4.1479,2.011,6.558,0.2369,0.5257,5.5452,3.8238,0.6936,2.082,2.7715,4.302,0.8617,0.4301,0.6678,0.8427,0.7775,1.7995,2.6821,1.2036,5.9808,4.7498,0.9573,4.4977,1.287,0.4574,4.2106,3.5202,5.398,3.9107,0.0138,5.5434,1.418,0.8248,5.9022,5.0781,1.3998,0.0477,9.4993,0.2133,7.2019,1.8824,3.2257,2.3075,3.0704,1.3307,1.9528,1.2146,1.0879,4.9573,2.9824,1.2684,5.1102,0.3848,0.456,1.1381,1.6798,1.9096,0.8259,1.8821,1.0623,0.4873,0.3098,1.5608,0.0002,2.0644,2.2318,4.6606,3.7385,7.2683,5.1104,0.0417,0.5474,4.9393,5.3755,0.6343,0.0203,0.0909,5.5743,1.8156,0.1054,2.1088,5.2534,2.7043,0.5913,1.2486,0.0002,1.8359,3.626,1.8535,4.7866,6.3714,0.3818,0.7762,0.2362,0.5748,4.9279,0.997,2.8133,3.4412,0.1807,1.4664,7.3084,0.0002,3.0637,1.6673,3.6805,0.0277,0.2911,0.0766,5.3389,1.0712,2.4932,3.0822,4.0607,3.3605,0.0512,0.0,2.1955,2.4658,0.0054,1.8019,0.9025,1.5795,1.2368,2.7092,0.2217,4.4187,2.7985,3.1325,1.2305,5.2322,0.4296,0.3895,2.1278,3.0477,0.5497,0.0536,4.7906,3.9959,1.2197,2.6927,2.9048,1.4309,1.0365,1.1553,3.7161,1.6333,1.2651,6.2803,2.2286,3.0111,0.455,7.169,0.1757,1.3106,0.8998,4.614,5.5647,1.8725,4.8625,6.4963,0.5575,2.9132,0.0061,2.6409,2.1677,9.9323,3.9738,1.1078,0.6901,0.1606,1.5752,1.1053,2.8116,2.7917,0.2033,4.5875,2.0941,5.6677,1.6645,1.4056,2.4319,4.7375,7.1462,2.3804,0.0336,5.2281,0.5165,1.3761,2.4061,6.625,6.1577,2.1164,0.5139,0.1455,1.0878,0.4226,3.9746,1.0383,2.8722,1.7312,1.1552,3.0007,0.4587,4.0814,5.6,1.8292,5.0568,1.135,3.375,0.4385,7.816,8.7635,1.0593,3.2097,5.9932,5.7554,0.0149,1.565,0.5276,0.0002,1.26,4.1738,3.528,0.0282,1.3673,0.0418,2.0684,5.2518,6.1422,0.1925,0.4196,0.9135,0.2607,0.0029,0.0059,5.0675,0.609,3.2949,4.007,1.594,4.9107,0.0015,3.6976,1.5095,2.0152,0.3102,0.2297,0.3937,1.8023,4.065,4.2995,5.2022,1.4724,0.0712,5.133,2.903,9.2016,2.5977,1.2455,1.2356,6.6293,2.6497,3.6643,3.3207,4.2028,1.4099,5.2595,6.1122,4.1859,4.4624,0.2303,0.2311,1.4891,0.5878,2.06,3.2784,4.2755,1.1119,9.2257,4.2163,2.295,8.5741,4.6975,2.0312,6.3931,7.2976,3.7167,1.9888,3.3651,3.0206,0.6983,0.0674,4.0914,6.0667,9.0213,6.4094,1.1424,1.1123,0.0002,2.0156,2.2888,2.2706,5.0472,0.9317,4.7481,2.1496,4.2051,1.9629,2.2807,0.0422,0.5181,3.2298,3.3683,0.0372,0.6772,1.0592,2.1636,2.5268,0.3095,2.5363,0.3573,2.0824,1.5438,0.6463,0.7828,2.2457,1.1469,1.1017,0.0221,0.0165,1.1155,1.4257,6.4925,0.1194,0.525,3.2608,3.0612,0.0925,2.1254,4.4737,1.8277,3.4668,7.2867,0.3855,8.6378,0.3331,0.2835,2.2864,0.2812,1.0646,0.6372,0.4506,0.5733,11.3249,0.0339,0.0053,7.2915,1.8191,3.369,1.1951,9.7812,2.6134,1.3832,3.6909,0.5374,4.7825,0.9931,3.3189,4.5259,0.2826,0.8977,0.561]}

She was lost off Nantucket on the morning of July 31, 1917, after being shelled by a British submarine. At the time she held a crew and five war reserve officers of 3,034 men.\n\nMcDougal was laid down by Bath Iron Works on July 17, 1913, launched on May 9, 1914, and commissioned as USS McDougal ( DD @ - @ 54 ) on December 21, 1914.\n\nShe was named USS McDougal after the town of that name, which is in Washington County, Iowa, and is located in the U. S. state of Iowa south of Grinnell. The name was suggested by Vice Admiral George P. Davison.\n\nMcDougal first visited Portland, Maine, and Seattle, Washington, where she was decommissioned in February 1916 and remained in that condition until September 25, 1918, when she was recommissioned at Tacoma under Captain W. S. Tuggle.\n\nAfter spending most of the next four years in reserve, she was reactivated as a flagship of the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, Atlantic Ocean Fleet of the U. S. Navy during World War I on October 4, 1919. (See USS McDougal by C. K. Hays).\n\nShe was decommissioned and designated as a fleet training ship in 1921 and was placed in reserve at Charleston, South Carolina, on March 1, 1922, and was subsequently sold to the Republic of Chile on September 14, 1922. She was transferred there on December 23, 1922, and renamed General Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo. On September 10, 1925, she was wrecked off Puerto Montt, Chile, while training Chilean navy personnel. The ship was salvaged on October 1, 1925, and rebuilt. She was renamed Condor and was based in Callao, Peru, in 1927 and later in Calcutta, India. She was decommissioned at Manila, Philippines, on March 28, 1939, and, because of the Spanish Civil War, she was placed in reserve on May 1, 1939.

(It may have been constructed with the same form as the \"sacred tree\" of the Temple of Anubis; see above.)\n\nOn the west side of the temple, Kaplony proposed, the Temple of Isis. It had the shape of a female torso and feet, and was oriented to rise due east, and face north. Kaplony's theory was that the form reflected the principle that good deeds will be rewarded and bad ones be punished as in the form of a snake. The sun would be at the west, as a \"female foot\" symbolizing a \"female head\", \"snake-like hands\" and \"female hips\" (to symbolize \"the male\" and \"the female\").\n\n< > @ jb @ - @ R\u02c1. @ \/\n\nThe temple was constructed using a technique known as the < dk > form. It was built on a foundation of bricks, and the surface was made rough where possible. The result, according to Kaplony, was more of a \"rough, ugly skin\" than the smooth exterior of most constructions. Kaplony proposed that the structure of the temple resembled the \"skin\" of a crocodile's upper body covered only with the scales of the front legs.\n\nA temple to the sun could not be constructed within a sacred enclosure dedicated to the moon [5]: in order to symbolize the sun, the east of the temple should be oriented to the east, and the north to the north, facing the rising sun to the east. But a sun temple would be positioned on the west side of the < jb >, with the east wall of the sanctuary facing the rising sun, so it would rise in the eastern sky.\n\nThe temple site, in the modern day area of \u200b\u200bFadak in the Dahra region of < kr > Ethiopia, was the site of the largest temple of the era built for Seti I. The temple was destroyed and later rebuilt. The ruins were visited by an Italian anthropologist in 1930. The site is part of the Qift (Fakr\u00e2tat\u00e2) complex which includes an archaeological site and an archeological museum.","token_len":527,"entropy":[7.6823,9.9756,6.0572,6.9233,1.7349,9.6462,5.4895,8.5442,8.3862,7.721,9.4885,3.5519,4.5266,1.6727,10.1195,3.148,7.1508,9.4692,12.3746,4.664,6.4319,9.3993,7.3191,6.3081,6.1639,5.3209,5.6086,1.4406,0.7944,6.3857,12.0179,4.514,6.0101,11.8755,9.9386,12.2585,7.6863,7.9193,4.5782,5.301,2.8613,7.9167,0.9634,11.5074,1.7842,6.1526,2.483,6.8803,8.0344,1.9173,10.201,0.0083,0.013,4.5265,0.7192,2.296,2.7447,1.6241,3.7665,2.0338,2.1464,5.6153,3.8298,3.5316,5.255,8.2457,5.0146,6.7943,6.7575,1.7242,3.9066,4.5083,3.7434,4.1223,5.5106,5.7261,1.6018,4.4864,4.2886,4.2129,2.4895,0.4923,4.669,2.6865,2.0137,2.8466,5.2641,1.1805,1.1225,4.6589,5.9001,0.2264,4.8309,1.3068,2.3379,1.4705,4.7509,0.2723,4.9024,3.5091,4.4275,1.7322,2.9524,1.079,2.3254,0.1084,4.8293,2.3372,7.884,0.518,0.1508,0.5772,1.4453,0.9423,3.5234,0.0015,0.0033,1.7308,4.6368,2.4989,4.9114,0.2228,8.0819,5.1123,3.1167,3.476,2.7531,3.7584,0.077,0.3667,7.5795,6.521,2.1315,5.4789,1.0594,1.6022,1.5982,6.3639,2.3725,6.0267,8.476,1.3696,2.2697,2.2997,7.1632,1.579,0.6842,2.3681,0.0004,0.0016,3.3265,4.8491,1.4154,0.4414,0.9683,6.0101,6.657,0.9355,5.6953,2.8461,6.0627,3.4306,4.8834,1.7979,1.1371,3.4976,2.7768,1.4077,7.128,0.0944,4.8804,6.1797,0.9692,4.9955,0.1616,1.8563,4.6128,0.8862,2.1356,3.7594,4.157,1.7896,4.0327,0.4291,4.1953,3.0172,4.123,3.5692,4.8396,7.1922,6.5311,1.3713,5.7301,1.164,2.9916,3.0903,2.4322,2.901,3.2535,5.6069,8.2099,0.1523,2.2864,1.3528,6.2369,0.647,0.7829,1.3116,2.8304,4.3081,1.6332,1.7904,5.5976,4.0959,0.0451,3.0931,2.274,4.0508,4.1993,1.2885,0.6246,0.8479,0.1137,0.8464,1.661,0.0002,6.5806,5.5167,1.8284,2.972,0.0184,0.455,0.0985,0.033,0.7241,0.0194,0.0015,6.1163,5.1693,5.1721,4.4863,0.0002,2.3216,2.3552,1.2161,2.7377,3.2033,1.7861,5.6055,1.9231,0.038,2.8861,6.3893,5.7993,4.4271,1.815,5.4973,1.3869,2.0489,0.8386,2.7569,2.1524,1.2778,4.2141,0.3563,5.3826,1.5129,1.7275,2.2315,6.0307,1.1254,2.9244,7.8558,7.4358,3.4928,1.0473,1.1727,6.6127,3.7263,1.8759,0.0009,0.3716,0.0002,0.0041,0.0929,0.1962,6.2724,3.2776,0.3895,2.6485,6.8263,3.414,7.7968,7.1997,1.556,0.8885,2.1474,5.1128,4.8332,1.3333,5.7873,6.5068,0.0034,0.6445,2.7029,0.0004,0.0028,2.6319,0.3207,0.7132,4.3981,2.852,0.2234,0.2482,3.4901,1.5891,3.2522,5.5549,1.8989,0.1942,0.7993,5.474,0.0072,3.6816,6.5051,0.8876,7.1956,6.9102,1.1027,3.371,5.7283,0.5992,2.2447,8.2501,2.0751,0.8622,1.6231,0.0002,4.0605,4.038,4.4192,1.0697,1.9002,4.9758,2.4621,0.653,1.7843,5.952,1.5105,7.2777,4.4616,7.6638,0.3763,1.065,6.0251,7.0734,5.5513,4.6364,5.6327,2.7483,0.0946,5.427,0.0425,0.6262,2.1507,1.1037,1.0676,6.7475,3.83,0.1631,0.5668,3.4173,0.6541,3.9448,1.5618,1.552,1.4105,1.1619,1.1614,0.5351,2.1884,0.8786,0.0698,2.0498,1.7426,5.5768,2.518,7.9589,0.2521,5.4469,1.0771,0.9656,0.4419,5.159,3.7559,4.8752,0.4168,2.3375,1.7349,7.2788,2.3403,0.8186,2.0668,0.234,0.1961,0.1416,7.6834,3.7398,0.6047,0.3584,5.2631,3.3831,0.6945,2.6906,5.026,2.4554,0.2037,6.151,1.1598,0.982,0.8633,0.1248,1.3996,3.268,3.9132,0.8797,4.428,2.4564,1.0259,4.8235,2.6159,0.896,1.3414,0.0002,1.948,2.2298,5.9578,3.3038,3.0554,1.7018,7.3832,2.4556,5.1789,0.5141,9.9618,1.5528,6.3022,6.9896,4.9888,5.4245,2.048,8.4706,5.6662,2.1872,0.8838,8.3116,3.887,2.7613,1.7828,8.9029,0.304,1.0316,3.3851,1.0188,0.063,1.2257,4.4446,2.0167,1.7675,0.8451,6.0544,5.9432,3.5138,8.7219,3.1804,4.8148,2.5737,1.6442,1.2218,0.833,5.7367,3.2332,5.3427,1.3389,2.8434,1.7201,4.9059,1.3772,7.4655,0.4246,4.5427,6.1362,4.9457,0.0218,3.4825,5.2828,1.2659,1.9927,3.026,1.8131,5.4306,0.0014,0.7828,7.5617,8.2154,6.1212,5.2764,3.6706,4.7633,6.2054,3.1511,6.1328,4.6331,1.1265,4.6954,3.628,3.4998,3.7609,3.9667,0.7204,2.381,2.5687,5.0169,0.044,3.3319,0.5285]}
{"id":3029,"ended":false,"length":497,"text":"Three independent ( private ) schools, including Episcopal High School ( 9 @ - @ 12 ), The Post Oak School ( Montessori K @ - @ 8 ), and the Veritas Academy have been on the agenda of the Houston Chronicle ( Sunday, Sept 9 -- \" Schools, teachers face off over test scores, accountability\" ) as an important issue for the city.\n\nThey've all done well in recent years on Texas' annual report card. For the public schools, the Chronicle has focused on \" A\" ratings, which are the best and make up 20 percent of a school's grade on the five-year report card. That means they've given only two schools an \" A,\" which is a good school.\n\nThe good news here is that if the Chronicle reporters had looked at last year's report card they would have found three other \" A \" public schools that were just as good as Episcopal: P.S. 19, Lillie Belle Allen, and P.S. 24 ( in Montrose ). These three were also recognized last year, so why should everyone get all excited about Episcopal?\n\nThe other good news is that, as private schools have begun to improve themselves and to be held to their own high standards, their public counterparts have begun to rise up. Our public schools are improving, but it is in spite of the Chronicle's ( and Mayor White's) constant efforts to downplay or ignore the progress.\n\nWhat is more disturbing than this latest Chronicle effort to push a few schools above the rest is the way in which they've done it. For example, to make the point that Episcopal and Episcopal-style schools are a danger to the city, the authors compare Episcopal to other suburban schools and the way in which their students take the tests.\n\nThis is not only dumb but it also serves only to reinforce the negative feelings towards the school. These test scores are what the state gives each school. It has nothing to do with anything. We give these ratings on the basis of our subjective view of a school, not on how well the children do on the standardized tests. It is true that Episcopal's scores are not in the \" A \" ranking as they were last year, but it is also true that P.S. 19, Lillie Belle Allen, and P.S. 24 are within the \" A \" ranking. One wonders if these other schools will be singled out and their scores be compared to those of Episcopal--just because they are public schools.\n\nNo wonder some of us are so anxious in a \" test - oriented city. \"","token_len":527,"entropy":[9.1862,7.4267,12.6833,0.8317,5.4666,2.5741,2.7015,10.3638,5.3832,0.3031,2.5058,8.5603,10.423,6.8516,5.5473,4.9356,2.076,4.7215,7.4161,4.6607,2.4669,0.331,10.9289,2.8405,0.0023,7.7019,8.765,1.029,0.3492,3.0332,0.516,1.1405,1.9473,8.9221,3.7042,3.1005,7.3611,1.6835,4.8056,0.5772,5.8958,2.4302,0.7904,7.1428,2.5593,4.6624,8.6761,0.761,2.6841,5.4823,7.6223,4.6122,7.6499,2.5105,6.1548,5.4577,4.1359,2.3948,7.6944,1.7561,3.6882,6.792,4.7022,0.8244,3.6367,5.3396,3.4811,3.1363,1.4672,1.1594,1.5938,1.1288,1.349,0.0022,5.4703,2.8072,4.6894,4.6775,2.1229,1.7739,2.7157,0.3732,5.2892,6.0512,1.7582,6.7726,5.0521,1.9587,2.1043,4.4652,1.8352,5.7767,1.9181,0.6639,1.6177,3.4931,2.1132,6.0182,0.2418,3.8656,8.332,6.5353,4.2904,1.2201,1.5348,1.639,2.434,3.9237,4.0785,10.7745,0.8472,5.0521,0.7047,0.0408,4.2638,0.3491,0.0352,4.3051,6.2293,0.8637,6.5751,0.755,1.7472,4.3124,0.6823,0.2858,4.3338,1.9909,2.6545,2.4733,5.1246,5.9844,3.5258,5.2665,3.4337,2.2877,0.7111,5.0774,2.5836,1.2731,2.2097,3.6926,7.6731,2.3782,0.9125,0.0003,1.9929,5.9874,0.3444,5.1896,0.3406,0.3669,5.1457,1.6826,1.1842,7.9848,3.7935,4.1553,0.3361,5.8986,0.1089,0.0095,2.1611,0.5875,3.6797,1.2741,0.2752,0.6716,4.1155,2.8565,4.0484,0.4825,2.8163,8.0109,0.0914,2.499,2.0561,5.746,1.707,0.7958,1.3385,10.7153,4.7481,6.6339,3.2044,3.2337,0.2484,6.1019,1.8754,5.5646,7.1364,1.4354,9.7812,7.687,2.7412,0.6866,3.8399,0.3365,0.9194,0.0348,3.7085,3.4084,7.1842,4.9794,6.9216,2.3851,4.426,1.6495,3.4064,3.6071,7.5977,5.2264,0.0891,2.4065,3.1425,6.0074,3.5277,6.6189,4.7166,2.9787,3.7326,0.6079,6.7139,1.6039,0.376,0.0002,1.9731,3.524,2.0033,0.0253,0.4632,0.1535,3.8118,2.6618,9.1909,0.5101,2.4546,5.0308,0.6711,4.7516,5.9242,2.5565,4.4996,3.3259,6.2143,2.8788,4.0951,2.2642,3.8485,0.0342,0.2736,3.9932,3.3785,6.5703,0.7034,2.5051,0.2072,5.2342,1.1822,1.6299,6.2575,3.2461,0.3841,1.4245,5.8601,1.6148,1.8645,3.1473,2.7319,4.4184,6.1293,0.0016,1.3411,6.1869,0.8121,5.2172,2.7141,6.6602,8.2798,0.1281,0.4246,6.1083,2.058,0.2514,4.8974,0.0245,3.6172,2.5911,1.085,4.3633,1.0561,0.5098,0.0003,4.0302,2.5395,3.1273,4.9951,2.8844,2.2851,4.1772,6.4928,4.3755,1.0611,4.7292,2.5479,4.3969,2.8548,4.39,1.1755,1.6817,0.738,1.0006,3.3252,2.7934,0.0015,2.4653,1.4054,3.492,1.5263,0.5222,3.8826,1.9309,0.0893,6.2894,3.5481,2.6396,3.9878,0.2849,4.9359,3.86,5.3499,2.7861,2.8377,0.7497,0.8649,4.2417,7.9939,0.3058,1.4606,1.8863,0.6525,1.2312,7.5566,8.8566,5.5841,2.8567,3.3258,6.5023,0.6386,2.4462,3.3051,4.157,1.9229,0.005,3.4323,4.0233,4.9003,2.0231,2.1743,1.1117,0.9764,0.0002,3.6965,0.9838,2.0817,3.1846,7.0521,2.3101,2.835,2.7101,4.7598,4.7274,0.2468,2.6123,0.5017,5.1579,5.5722,5.8759,1.3144,3.0085,2.3869,4.7598,6.76,0.3137,1.1058,4.9019,3.4135,6.0779,4.3934,4.2891,1.2098,1.9052,2.9455,4.2162,2.7266,0.0515,0.0367,0.004,5.4897,2.3752,4.2581,4.6189,3.6899,6.6047,4.0856,1.5077,1.8984,0.0569,3.0625,5.4251,5.4659,0.1797,2.9278,0.3947,1.8509,1.2603,1.5138,3.2139,1.0335,2.1517,5.2553,1.804,2.1526,0.7068,4.1628,0.5996,0.2852,3.2261,1.0657,5.8191,0.154,5.1782,3.444,2.3009,0.8135,3.4202,4.8008,1.617,3.2745,4.1723,0.2883,6.6201,4.512,2.3884,1.7945,1.4676,0.0421,0.7577,0.2163,2.291,0.6675,1.19,0.1297,0.0439,3.7625,0.0216,0.0195,0.0644,0.6211,2.3086,1.0486,0.0022,0.0002,0.0025,0.0018,1.0599,0.3612,0.2013,0.0009,0.0031,0.0016,0.0525,1.168,6.1659,0.5075,1.0745,0.6488,0.1285,1.4526,0.7748,6.1258,3.5845,1.3974,2.8801,4.6153,0.9452,2.7052,2.0428,6.101,0.0049,3.3715,4.8066,1.576,4.0373,3.6621,0.8884,2.071,0.2694,3.6278,7.6777,5.4888,2.3688,1.0242,1.1833,3.169,0.8536,1.025,0.3378,0.0003,5.6734,2.2739,3.8152,1.8243,2.7097,1.4641,1.9639,4.403,6.3599,4.4519,5.6862,6.0384,9.0093,9.6312,2.6744,2.8748,2.0196]}

He worked on a number of Sierra projects until 2009.\n\nIn March 1999, Blackley started a company in North Carolina under the name \"Blackley Corporation\", later known as Blackley Software. His first project was a space combat simulation based on the Wing Commander universe.\n\nThe game was cancelled due to financial difficulties experienced by Blackley, who was unable to attract support for the project within Sierra.\n\nBlackley then created a real-time strategy game (Tower of Dawn) and a 3D flight simulator (Air Commander).\n\nBlacksley left Blackley Software in October 2001 after a few years of working almost constantly, but also only receiving a minimal wage. His projects were either cancelled completely at that time or abandoned shortly thereafter, leaving a large number of unsold copies of Tower of Dawn on the market.\n\nIn 2004 Blackley was made a co-owner of Denton, Texas-based game developer Blacklake Studios, but left shortly after.\n\nIn 2005, Blackley created a website about flight simulation, which, although not an official Looking Glass product, was intended for the public eye.\n\nIn June 2007, Blackley started working on his first free-to-play browser-based space simulation. After working on it for one year, it was announced in September 2008 as Universe.\n\nIn April 2009, Blackley announced that he would no longer be working on Universe and that development of the game would be handed over to a contractor. However, Blackley kept at least one connection to the project, by creating a newsletter devoted to the game. Since then he has occasionally updated the newsletter, while it has not been updated since December 2010.","token_len":527,"entropy":[7.9887,6.4042,0.2086,13.3171,0.532,7.0517,9.3916,8.0161,1.606,6.3718,3.9377,4.5555,8.3481,7.5342,0.2981,0.6016,1.0575,4.2212,0.3011,3.0816,0.4488,8.1744,14.3195,8.0514,5.4401,8.1212,11.2936,0.1435,8.5771,11.1909,1.8731,7.0935,5.2507,2.9517,3.0,6.9346,3.1229,1.7585,2.8243,2.3516,4.7355,0.7644,1.0611,2.154,4.6713,1.3674,1.0321,1.9849,0.0029,2.3948,2.7903,2.3378,0.205,5.4122,0.1287,7.9187,8.1447,6.9126,0.2061,7.2992,2.7179,2.308,1.8607,3.3716,0.2714,5.3909,2.263,7.5104,0.6242,0.0142,2.1513,2.3924,0.1419,7.0963,0.0012,2.1815,1.5903,5.2017,0.1386,5.0133,0.02,2.624,5.2428,1.1148,0.0059,0.2611,1.8016,2.8106,0.0103,6.7114,1.3496,1.4146,8.9614,2.6975,1.0177,0.015,0.3142,0.9056,0.0002,2.1315,3.2229,2.0109,0.0973,5.9224,0.0829,2.6435,7.2076,0.912,5.5465,0.4719,4.8356,1.3419,5.9491,2.7863,0.0013,4.985,2.5824,7.1849,0.6758,4.0752,2.0183,0.2552,5.7429,3.2313,1.3792,1.2205,0.0002,1.1016,2.234,0.9735,0.0916,3.7086,3.7832,5.6512,2.5925,1.084,5.6685,5.1967,3.3704,6.5337,5.276,0.014,1.5685,7.8235,1.7135,5.5559,0.7282,1.3226,0.002,1.6434,2.3133,1.6074,4.0014,4.2127,3.2392,1.0648,0.0002,0.891,2.5826,0.2189,0.0688,2.8281,0.0091,3.49,7.8897,3.2565,3.2795,1.2409,4.971,2.5912,0.0315,1.5128,1.6867,4.6728,2.6663,3.4423,4.5019,0.049,4.6102,4.9239,4.8059,1.2178,2.085,3.3152,1.3956,2.5547,1.0899,0.002,4.4607,3.2779,5.2554,5.0282,1.009,0.3922,0.0002,0.8173,3.2861,0.8141,0.0823,1.8738,0.0072,3.9199,1.8311,2.6178,5.0551,4.8042,0.6625,7.409,0.5531,0.1976,2.7622,2.9312,2.1851,5.8715,1.6957,5.4983,2.1828,0.0348,1.6854,1.8295,3.5691,0.8977,4.2017,2.5238,2.0836,0.4314,1.4985,6.8066,2.5352,3.4158,3.7671,0.105,1.2714,4.7053,0.1296,4.0032,0.8074,0.8861,0.0001,4.4382,3.0839,1.6161,3.7796,2.8499,0.0039,2.5442,1.1947,8.8166,0.563,2.4502,0.0142,1.8607,1.6334,1.9754,2.6507,0.0078,6.6431,4.7466,2.304,0.9201,0.4945,7.0764,2.0334,2.2061,0.7515,0.0001,3.1056,0.0127,4.6364,4.1997,1.6189,7.235,0.5771,0.1649,1.3562,0.3945,4.5518,4.5837,6.4762,1.1646,7.508,0.566,2.7585,2.0857,4.2022,0.1061,5.905,0.6461,2.049,4.7125,5.5312,0.8236,1.034,0.0002,5.8751,3.1111,0.8758,4.0454,5.5397,1.1784,2.2571,0.7486,3.121,2.6202,2.9773,2.3036,3.4207,1.3543,1.3687,1.6778,9.919,6.9418,3.3281,2.6598,4.8004,6.5557,6.4785,1.7986,7.0177,3.866,1.2436,3.4951,7.2626,1.592,5.9336,1.3812,6.3409,6.1467,2.3386,0.3338,0.6045,3.9624,6.0424,1.315,2.2522,3.2974,2.9899,2.3799,1.6739,0.0548,6.7909,1.6309,1.6653,1.0146,7.4035,0.0481,0.0481,2.6264,0.4097,1.0256,0.2771,0.3323,0.0001,1.2726,3.6016,3.3033,0.0254,2.2621,5.425,1.3641,2.5879,0.0782,3.2068,0.2747,6.3423,5.8006,2.83,2.5898,0.9505,0.0104,5.4751,1.4257,4.9726,6.4098,3.61,1.2111,3.3359,2.796,2.5723,0.9479,1.1662,0.7634,0.0002,0.8398,2.7908,0.4566,1.0352,0.123,4.3458,1.4976,5.3886,5.2102,5.3753,1.5533,1.8606,2.7061,5.1454,3.7773,1.748,4.0567,0.4727,10.6801,0.0046,2.8935,0.1145,1.5067,4.4242,2.0776,2.2519,3.8589,7.5601,0.5243,0.9337,0.0001,0.6826,2.0869,1.9464,0.1587,1.2623,0.0379,3.5199,2.3301,0.3348,2.5691,1.7604,6.4324,1.0389,0.0976,0.0015,0.008,6.3834,3.1929,0.0548,6.1499,4.1645,3.3623,4.8678,2.8005,0.6457,3.2791,0.1511,4.7179,0.2421,0.2167,2.68,0.4697,3.0722,2.5479,2.086,0.8157,3.6263,10.8203,3.4502,0.5622,0.0002,0.5777,3.1381,0.597,0.1133,1.1486,0.0231,2.5795,0.8154,0.2909,1.3158,3.4689,0.0003,0.6106,0.9316,0.374,4.6287,2.8031,2.5044,8.5173,1.5525,1.4854,0.9795,0.8455,1.7234,8.0075,0.1046,0.041,3.0547,6.9999,1.0037,3.9958,0.0435,2.7739,0.0479,6.5144,6.5325,2.4679,1.5996,8.8537,0.8499,1.4071,2.2768,1.2495,5.7538,5.3578,0.8639,6.0428,7.2061,0.0983,1.6294,2.1591,0.989,6.4347,0.7577,2.3345,0.2564,6.8811,4.8782,0.906,0.2285,1.7515,5.7028,6.2926,1.5762,1.9974,0.6327,0.683,0.9395,4.3512,2.589,0.1268]}

{"id":2574,"ended":true,"length":500,"text":"`` Oubliette `` was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia, as were the rest of the episodes of the third season. The location of the antagonist's house was an important factor during the filming of the episodes, as the directors wanted to give a kind of eerie and surreal atmosphere to the characters. It should be noted that two of the episodes in the series, the first and the second of the current year, were filmed in an old factory. The production company shot many of the interior shots on a stage, and everything that was filmed in the garden set was done with the help of a specially built and equipped dolly.\n\nAfter the filming of all thirteen episodes, the crew decided to create an overall impression on the set that would have had the opposite effect and was intended to be as cold as possible to give people the feeling of loneliness in his home. The actors wore simple clothes, with minimal makeup and were photographed in the scenes they filmed in a small room in order for the atmosphere on the set to be in accordance with the narrative that was being told.\n\nIn the episode \"Oubliette\" we can see a flashback where Rachel, a homeless teenager, lives in an abandoned and decrepit hotel. In the episode \"House of Cards\" we can see how Claire Underwood moves into a house, that was bought in her name, but she does not live there. In both scenes we can see that these places look depressing, dark and eerie. This atmosphere of suspense and horror is emphasized by the sound recording, which is deliberately played soft and sad, which contributes to the sense of melancholy felt by the actors.\n\nThe interior and exterior shots in ''Oubliette'' and in \"House of Cards\" were shot with the help of the camera with a 35mm film, which allowed the crew to shoot the two episodes with the same camera, and at a relatively low cost. All scenes were filmed on the same day, except for the scenes that were shot of the interior of his wife's house in the episode \"House of Cards\", and those in \"Oubliette\", which were shot at different times in the same week.\n\nBy far the most expensive film of the season is the production of the episode \"House of Cards\". The episode is shot in 16mm and contains many elements typical for an old horror movies.

Du Bois, the dean of an elite \"race\" of people (African-Americans) who, according to Du Bois's theory, constituted a separate sub-species of humanity from the \"materially powerful\" Caucasians and constituted, if nothing else, an \"outcast race\" worthy of \"special attention\" - and only if they had access to the educational benefits that the IMN had pioneered in America and were willing to follow the curriculum to its logical conclusion.\n\nSince the 1970s there was a dramatic shift in U.S attitudes toward race. Although much effort was made to explain away the radical change, in the words of U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy : 'There was a shift in social attitudes in the 1970s'. There was no \"shift in social attitudes in the 1970s\"; or at least only a slight, gradual and, for some, almost unnoticed change in the prevailing attitudes toward certain subjects.\n\nThe transformation from the race paradigm, that was created in the 1930s by the eugenicist sociologist Richard Popenoe, to the multiracial paradigm, that was created out of a multiracial consciousness after 1965 (the 'Nixon Shock' ) was only of the mind, and not of the heart. Du Bois himself was one-quarter Black (his father was a slave ) and one-quarter white. He was by the way, the only one of the three members of this prominent American group (the \"Big Three\") who was completely honest when referring to the Negro underclass, as well as the Jewish minority - about whom Du Bois stated 'Jews were the Negroes of the Ghetto... And it was true' - in a recent interview. His fellow member of the 'Big Three' (W.E.B. Du Bois ) had publicly distanced himself from his own race, at the end of his life, as a result of his new theory which would become the new paradigm for Black and Hispanic groups within the U.S. (the 'New Negro Paradigm') The Jewry was the original and, because of its size, the current minority underclass of the United States of America. This 'New Negro Paradigm' still dominates our intellectual life.","token_len":529,"entropy":[2.6222,3.9576,4.7532,0.2563,0.632,4.6205,1.1987,0.1939,10.5265,3.0324,0.0034,7.8442,0.3178,0.8653,9.9451,0.0845,5.0241,7.4546,1.5933,9.6197,0.5133,0.025,6.56,1.5391,0.2444,0.0041,1.3786,4.9289,1.7203,2.2058,7.1929,0.0534,0.5184,8.7082,0.0617,0.0,0.7113,2.4531,1.8935,1.0187,2.4383,4.2522,1.0321,7.0718,0.539,1.5124,5.3569,1.5814,6.9589,5.9115,3.8836,2.5406,0.3721,2.4104,1.2938,3.844,6.376,1.1616,5.532,0.0502,0.2816,2.0625,7.1198,0.0445,5.4237,0.051,2.2903,0.0199,0.3257,0.0796,0.0161,0.0068,0.0004,1.9693,2.5755,7.2291,0.0966,7.0115,3.6197,6.3037,4.8852,2.1432,5.2792,5.4267,5.8171,5.2508,0.7054,0.3141,1.5183,1.2078,3.639,2.8374,0.0009,2.1425,0.0057,0.0006,2.0176,3.8511,0.1849,5.312,1.7424,4.7721,4.462,1.6984,2.9865,0.7045,2.6812,2.034,0.9775,2.2663,5.1204,7.692,0.0948,8.69,0.9458,4.662,0.043,3.2513,7.4349,4.286,5.6688,5.7702,0.3874,0.0057,2.3793,1.843,4.4551,1.0765,2.5979,1.247,6.7764,0.0308,3.5753,5.0533,2.7231,1.4693,7.3403,2.7049,6.2165,3.9098,2.2429,3.0234,5.3055,0.0268,1.6069,5.5705,5.6856,2.5383,3.0298,2.8514,0.0134,2.9514,7.8692,3.0543,3.3391,3.0753,3.3315,2.6071,0.0528,6.3622,2.336,7.2166,4.3893,2.8071,0.8486,0.2432,0.2476,1.2818,0.0081,5.5967,1.5738,4.3438,0.0299,5.5172,4.1311,0.9256,5.6423,1.7015,0.2676,5.3001,0.0039,0.0032,9.5625,0.6802,1.3514,1.5243,4.5175,4.668,5.8638,0.7413,0.9505,0.3594,3.9918,2.1783,0.9744,7.277,4.32,2.5077,3.5328,0.9814,5.8518,0.0007,5.9815,0.0738,0.0626,0.0049,2.3276,4.0554,0.5537,6.5968,3.5686,3.3676,1.5994,1.6991,3.6413,0.5918,5.1866,0.8337,2.6367,0.9263,3.7231,0.0317,5.6847,4.6965,0.4924,2.3575,4.1249,6.9793,0.4966,2.2368,0.1007,1.2253,0.3304,1.2248,0.0014,3.4402,5.9682,2.5891,0.141,5.3554,1.3301,2.8363,3.5297,4.1578,4.6681,5.0298,3.2122,2.0356,1.0499,4.7501,5.0333,1.8886,1.6584,1.5276,5.8649,2.224,2.0409,7.2949,3.6112,0.6246,1.6037,0.0003,1.893,5.3744,2.877,1.94,5.5282,7.3681,3.3703,4.2868,2.5947,5.2093,1.7602,0.477,3.3668,0.0326,1.5901,1.175,8.5711,1.6566,0.0002,1.1336,5.456,0.0472,3.4954,10.578,6.6977,9.5486,1.1795,0.6396,0.5025,6.789,0.5995,0.0003,2.4944,0.6745,0.9515,0.7658,0.7314,8.2956,0.0042,3.2505,8.3193,0.18,0.0014,5.1698,5.8204,5.8425,4.9542,2.9423,4.0408,5.8374,2.8738,6.9266,1.4572,6.7463,1.3281,4.6213,6.4959,3.3418,7.0794,2.4847,1.9845,2.2098,1.0857,0.2953,2.8278,0.6573,5.976,0.0045,0.0011,4.3551,1.9417,3.2838,5.6868,1.8004,5.45,2.9805,3.051,2.1036,0.5061,1.3855,2.9918,7.9466,0.2917,3.199,0.0407,1.6955,1.8097,1.3619,2.6045,0.9468,6.3428,4.0321,3.7657,1.998,1.8388,2.2929,2.9251,0.5604,1.0608,2.6012,4.5733,0.042,4.2279,8.0392,5.154,2.9423,3.0793,2.0015,3.6197,5.633,0.6834,0.6625,1.1218,2.2147,6.4238,6.1074,4.5398,6.2213,0.0341,1.5084,3.1648,5.9672,2.3071,1.8941,3.2966,2.1866,0.0106,2.2764,6.7894,3.9339,4.1696,6.4586,3.0449,2.2353,0.0128,0.0016,5.7673,4.0736,5.6037,2.0666,1.6051,5.7195,0.9389,1.5759,0.9593,7.6052,0.6387,5.1238,4.9637,4.0651,0.5782,4.4509,3.8572,1.4495,3.7326,2.3863,5.3779,0.9283,1.6248,4.4182,6.1356,5.6963,1.8661,0.3992,3.3033,0.8254,0.0242,0.502,3.2644,5.7907,0.1595,1.8369,0.0378,0.678,0.1843,0.0208,0.0141,0.0016,4.4076,3.8707,7.3844,7.2761,0.0268,0.0636,0.0848,2.7979,1.8702,1.7658,1.7248,5.5869,1.7148,3.4796,0.0157,1.8375,1.4235,0.8624,3.4404,1.6159,1.1238,0.041,1.3838,7.3686,6.5203,4.796,4.2269,3.7521,1.1357,5.0947,3.2249,1.6803,5.9164,2.9586,3.1762,4.849,4.6837,0.2763,1.8548,0.0007,0.0006,0.196,3.5494,3.3913,1.457,3.3098,2.8786,6.9511,0.0116,2.0022,4.6687,8.1942,5.6359,2.2351,2.6871,6.111,3.3998,3.9934,5.1072,0.5528,1.4456,6.9917,0.6231,1.9207,7.5707,4.6646,5.469,0.1762,2.6231,1.0357,2.1989,0.0084,4.4021,0.0072,0.7053,3.6632,4.1643,1.8971,0.0325,0.104,0.0006,0.1832,6.1646,3.797,3.8355,6.487,2.4153,2.5367]}
{"id":4956,"ended":true,"length":489,"text":"Planning for the segment of Highway 403 through Mississauga dates back to the late 1950s when the Hamilton Expressway appeared on the Metropolitan Toronto's regional transportation plan. It was to be a continuation of the Port Credit Parkway, then a toll highway operated by a separate company than the MTO. It was meant as a connection between the two cities, linking Highway 401 to Highway 403.\n\nIn 1969, the provincial government decided on a new alignment for the expressway, running roughly east-west to avoid running along much of the Mississauga Creek valley.\n\nThis new alignment would have kept the expressway and the new Mavis Street interchange in Peel Region, and only two years later, the Mavis St interchange had been built.\n\nBut there were problems with the new route. The highway was to follow just north of the creek valley; in parts there was no room to grade the route. In some cases, the terrain forced the route east of the valley, and many trees were cleared by hand because of their height or proximity to the road. The result was more than 100 acres of land cleared along the highway that should have been protected natural landscapes.\n\nAnd there were other problems - the original plans to build the expressway included a tunnel, meant to have been built to avoid the creek where flooding risk was the greatest. However, in many places, the planned tunnel ran directly through an existing creek.\n\nPlanning for the tunnel was completed in 1973, and as the new alignment approached the tunnel exit site, many trees needed to be cut down for the structure to be constructed.\n\n\"It was a clear case of damage control,\" says John Haines. \"They said it [the expressway] wasn't meant to cross a natural habitat, and the existing creek was already there. But they also knew it was the only way to build it.\"\n\nWhen the tunnel was completed in 1973, there were still about 20 acres of land cleared along the highway.\n\nHowever, the expressway remained a toll highway until 1985, when it was decommissioned and the land between Brampton Avenue and Highway 407 transferred to the local municipality of Peel. The municipality has now sold most of the land to developer Westdale.\n\nMost of the highway was designated a heritage conservation area in 2002, which means that it cannot be developed until certain conditions are met. One of those conditions is that the area must be naturalized, and a plan to connect a portion of the road to an existing nature trail was approved in August 2016.\n\nThe nature trail still needs to be designed.","token_len":529,"entropy":[7.9938,2.3118,1.8867,10.8794,2.6296,8.764,6.6797,4.3416,8.5876,0.004,10.0083,0.3363,0.1777,1.5675,2.3261,2.7047,0.0519,2.7425,1.2631,7.4875,6.0732,0.0371,7.4609,1.7621,0.3941,9.2841,4.1072,4.2528,6.8508,5.4475,1.5534,0.5186,3.1966,0.9254,4.1975,1.0138,2.0772,6.4593,0.0356,0.3188,7.4427,6.647,4.9265,1.2838,5.8727,2.631,5.2349,2.3869,6.7865,0.2294,3.4079,5.351,1.9813,9.7817,0.7325,4.8947,5.2032,1.0295,3.2314,0.9155,4.7396,3.4073,0.3138,5.5243,0.5933,1.1005,1.8943,2.4158,1.3125,4.8933,6.1743,1.4934,1.5714,3.0626,1.845,1.6643,0.9246,0.0012,2.6668,4.6106,0.2366,1.1203,4.1349,0.2787,3.2392,3.5028,0.8211,1.7527,6.0119,1.9999,0.512,3.2424,0.0359,1.3712,7.7684,5.8333,4.3797,1.9276,0.081,4.0923,5.2041,5.1043,3.997,6.4925,0.0288,0.7447,5.4903,0.0027,8.0553,4.5269,0.4886,2.3165,0.0004,3.9765,2.3456,0.453,2.3306,1.6809,5.886,0.4323,1.391,0.0105,4.3666,1.405,3.8847,3.1915,16.7073,5.0433,2.7587,3.2245,9.5271,2.3393,1.9772,2.6991,6.5817,5.205,5.0339,0.4436,0.7962,1.2499,2.1965,3.6195,4.7755,5.9143,4.104,0.7906,1.893,1.8219,0.7782,0.0003,3.8911,4.1689,1.4594,3.2243,1.3788,0.4776,1.3594,3.6952,0.8502,1.861,4.2954,1.5335,3.5254,6.1946,6.3974,1.6549,0.097,1.1302,8.3559,2.5777,5.1535,3.7355,6.7099,5.6925,1.1261,2.4689,7.335,1.5111,9.1066,2.4518,4.6041,1.3912,3.0818,2.1589,2.3487,0.26,0.9725,7.6804,6.9972,1.1532,2.6594,5.4844,1.8064,0.4777,3.8737,1.2966,2.1139,4.7188,7.2333,1.2367,5.8654,4.1477,5.5126,4.8695,0.446,4.8016,3.2701,4.1803,5.5053,0.0556,0.6871,2.1563,0.2721,2.7684,5.7578,0.2698,4.8819,1.5689,3.067,4.7909,0.0717,3.3683,3.9871,5.0448,0.5907,3.4086,4.0122,6.1566,0.2978,0.1821,4.8376,11.0255,5.5068,0.5624,0.2609,0.0003,4.8072,3.0009,0.797,1.7527,0.6061,7.2231,2.0384,5.2633,5.24,3.8233,1.1828,0.9183,0.9162,0.0174,4.3863,1.5948,4.9126,2.7084,6.5664,0.1447,5.922,2.3854,1.9675,3.0114,3.9617,1.8873,4.174,7.2592,8.0771,8.9076,1.3628,3.6355,3.2156,0.4776,4.8689,0.0383,2.6975,4.9277,2.8807,0.8338,0.8981,5.578,1.0126,5.0337,4.4325,2.3105,4.132,1.9791,3.0287,1.8052,0.8737,0.0003,7.0902,0.0539,0.4527,0.2693,5.6763,1.7191,4.8153,0.3805,3.6264,0.9827,1.0075,4.847,2.1292,4.0008,2.4206,3.4462,2.004,5.9845,8.7628,6.1751,1.6691,5.1896,3.7608,7.3029,0.1885,0.0453,2.1,1.3031,3.4542,1.0577,7.2314,0.4098,1.6249,3.4463,0.3277,1.064,0.0003,4.0629,2.1209,0.6674,1.4889,6.3518,4.0004,0.3508,7.7334,1.4796,1.4842,1.2989,4.2956,4.6795,4.4664,0.2806,5.2011,0.6031,3.9221,3.972,2.5636,8.4454,0.3169,5.7495,0.0037,0.1534,3.6169,0.0003,5.6351,0.2544,4.1394,3.5066,5.3639,4.4577,1.4445,1.4706,2.8441,5.2809,3.7395,1.3379,4.0875,2.7223,1.3513,3.1637,2.0203,3.5845,3.7053,1.8256,0.8661,3.6864,2.4563,1.2151,0.6153,4.0639,2.3724,1.1537,0.026,0.0002,4.5328,0.7501,2.0137,0.8495,1.0554,1.4872,2.885,0.0782,3.6922,0.4047,3.1869,3.4929,3.2557,1.7796,0.2556,2.1463,3.7235,1.5871,0.3669,2.0661,1.4707,1.8255,0.0003,4.5361,0.0215,1.5551,4.6766,0.0081,4.4501,2.6123,7.4616,1.0627,3.2634,3.8146,0.7775,0.1697,1.5208,0.2271,5.6526,0.0,0.0002,1.6053,2.3869,4.4872,6.4314,7.5782,0.0036,4.2768,0.0618,2.7616,3.1158,7.7773,0.2041,0.7176,5.8134,2.2678,2.0636,2.4552,0.595,2.559,5.2331,3.3651,3.6083,4.4234,4.5052,0.0234,0.2733,0.3328,1.3256,5.3226,6.1973,5.7706,2.591,0.2318,0.0003,6.6473,0.3069,0.2687,5.1782,2.1556,6.2486,2.2634,5.4013,6.3225,0.6841,2.1122,4.3597,0.8144,3.039,1.8131,1.78,1.4502,4.9969,0.2391,5.2597,4.4807,8.1517,1.6351,0.178,0.0169,0.3435,6.2607,0.8223,0.8486,0.1375,0.3118,0.8525,1.0386,3.5615,1.5938,0.303,6.9182,3.148,1.952,1.4053,3.7102,3.9911,1.9445,5.9226,4.9378,2.3103,0.0124,0.2518,3.4324,0.7644,3.3253,0.75,6.6496,5.8259,2.9413,2.9147,1.0473,5.1739,3.5523,0.1492,0.1996,0.0003,1.7979,6.9436,0.1599,6.8058,2.8202,0.4398,0.0592,5.3966,2.7588]}
{"id":3715,"ended":true,"length":466,"text":"Organisms vary in their ability to synthesize the 20 common amino acids. Most bacteria and plants can synthesize all twenty, but mammals can only synthesize eleven nonessential amino acids, so nine essential amino acids must be consumed by animals.\n\nIn addition, the three essential fatty acids, linoleic acid, \u03b2-linolenic acid, and linolenic acid, are present only in plants. ( Linolenic acid is an essential fatty acid because the body can not synthesize it.) Therefore, it is necessary to obtain them, in some form, from our diet.\n\nThe fat\u2013 and protein\u2013containing parts of plant foods can serve as fuel only when the body also possesses fuel for energy (i.e., the amino acids present in them), because amino acids must be processed to be used to produce energy. Our body uses three amino acids: serine, cysteine, and glycine. Although these essential amino acids can also be gotten from meat or animal bones, the body is not very efficient in processing them.\n\nMost protein food is available in the form of legumes and other plant parts, where the amino acids can be broken or converted for energy production. So some protein foods that are commonly consumed (for example, meat, eggs, milk, and eggs) do not contain them, since our body is able to derive protein more efficiently from the nonprotein-containing parts. If it were possible for the body to derive all of its protein directly from animals, such foods would not be necessary.\n\nFoods Contain Essential Amino Acids\n\nMeat and animal foods usually contain at least some essential amino acids (see below), but the quantity supplied from such foods is far from adequate for most people. Vegetarians and Vegans may be protein-deficient, if they also miss most essential amino acids from meats and some other animal products. For a complete diet, including the essentials plus some of the rarer ones, it is important that plant-based foods also contain the essential amino acids.\n\nWhen a vegetarian or vegan seeks sources of the essential amino acids, he or she has four main choices:\n\n1. The dietary amino acid supplements listed above\n\n2. Diet replacement foods\n\n3. The amino acid amino acids from animal protein source ;\n\n4. A combination of 1-3. If a vegetarian or vegan supplements 1-3, they may be able to get all the amino acids by a vegetarian diet, which consists mainly of grains and legume and some vegetable sources, especially soy in a soy milk or tofu product.","token_len":529,"entropy":[8.8064,7.4326,0.8514,0.6884,2.6324,0.0342,4.8291,0.0762,2.7849,9.7008,8.27,1.7708,0.1138,1.7415,3.7409,5.0937,2.9832,4.0759,3.3094,0.703,0.0091,3.8127,6.7811,3.7441,0.8371,7.9454,2.2181,1.5314,0.2242,0.0173,7.6184,9.831,1.4613,0.1056,0.0155,1.7839,3.7386,7.16,3.505,0.0663,0.0312,3.2041,0.1885,4.1427,3.1442,3.788,1.1961,1.7568,0.0024,3.1535,2.488,0.6618,2.2314,5.5724,2.0035,3.6527,0.1039,1.965,3.7636,0.029,0.0021,0.0286,0.3763,7.3214,0.0453,1.1456,0.0062,0.0005,0.0199,1.745,0.0457,2.8674,0.7882,0.0013,0.0132,0.599,0.826,3.004,4.0965,0.1455,2.9658,0.9913,5.1232,10.2297,2.5743,0.0013,0.0896,0.5211,3.0473,1.092,0.4443,0.0097,4.7522,4.0802,3.9287,3.175,3.3903,1.2252,0.0116,0.6155,1.5235,4.4201,0.076,2.3949,0.4091,2.7054,0.6587,3.1368,3.9571,5.4225,3.1594,4.5289,3.0132,0.3651,0.453,7.0984,3.4274,0.5236,1.2656,0.0002,2.0987,7.2267,7.9308,6.5894,1.817,0.1298,3.1773,6.0744,0.0788,3.2109,0.7628,3.0085,5.8206,0.2193,4.8555,8.8128,1.8481,2.0487,1.9179,7.5162,5.1501,5.4587,2.2856,2.8509,3.2672,3.7525,0.0006,0.0006,0.0666,2.3548,3.9763,0.3609,2.9152,0.1397,5.8425,4.2585,4.3876,3.956,0.0539,3.9272,0.2575,5.7814,2.3005,3.328,2.4088,3.8043,1.6921,0.5424,0.5123,6.195,1.7321,2.8945,5.377,2.4443,0.027,2.1615,8.0527,0.0041,0.1685,3.5097,0.0089,0.0002,0.3877,0.0384,3.5177,0.0131,0.4075,4.8906,2.1711,4.9453,0.5278,0.0235,2.7192,3.884,0.2185,9.782,0.3755,4.4077,2.0824,2.8866,5.8556,0.2207,2.4846,2.3484,3.0705,1.1814,4.8659,0.4074,1.2277,2.0079,0.9657,0.5883,1.4364,0.0002,4.9666,4.7907,6.2009,1.6784,6.3874,1.481,2.5636,0.1131,0.0054,5.0212,0.0253,2.0044,2.8835,1.7079,6.9085,1.3831,5.1838,1.5171,2.056,0.2628,2.8253,0.2109,6.6126,7.0592,2.9713,5.6125,0.6046,4.8613,0.4489,5.6943,5.5633,2.8772,1.2548,3.9762,0.8642,4.6721,1.3147,4.8867,3.3872,0.1681,0.2505,3.4808,1.1555,2.8463,0.1252,3.192,0.1964,1.2325,2.1235,0.4603,3.954,0.0841,0.9611,5.5292,2.0536,3.6622,6.135,0.8915,2.5159,4.5203,0.0167,6.8383,5.3647,6.2435,0.3827,0.7093,1.841,6.0776,5.2998,3.8859,0.6118,1.7775,1.475,4.9154,4.4138,1.5736,0.6489,1.8544,1.2421,0.2335,0.0376,3.6832,3.2432,0.9849,1.0668,2.8874,4.1339,0.0613,5.1281,0.2574,4.0122,4.7594,0.3153,1.8918,0.5227,2.6319,0.7353,0.7252,0.0002,4.9823,0.797,8.4121,2.8348,2.3854,0.3685,0.1584,0.0935,0.0003,0.3502,0.0002,4.3706,1.7686,2.0229,2.5053,5.4149,0.0771,3.6104,0.0115,3.1537,1.8227,0.0852,0.1665,2.6583,3.5438,2.3876,1.9104,1.043,3.0834,5.6177,7.3684,5.3527,5.0029,0.5846,1.3086,5.4456,1.936,3.2646,1.3231,3.8871,2.431,0.6657,4.8483,1.2947,1.5578,6.8588,0.0021,3.1457,2.4225,10.3649,1.0649,5.196,0.0021,0.9857,4.7322,0.643,5.4058,7.7224,4.5936,0.5893,0.0337,0.0673,3.6302,3.9035,1.0759,5.3147,2.1968,1.8332,1.7836,0.3895,3.6466,4.3094,2.9127,7.2007,1.295,3.9323,2.8747,5.3086,8.8152,3.2259,2.7506,0.1406,6.3086,2.8996,3.4928,0.2614,3.7214,0.1987,1.8309,2.4722,5.7967,2.3296,0.3223,0.7637,4.7488,0.4207,3.0354,1.0678,0.1323,0.0893,1.039,0.4504,0.0001,4.9596,3.0916,1.4434,0.8982,0.1745,6.1472,9.1781,0.1097,4.5592,0.6568,0.0439,0.0744,1.0683,2.1349,0.4343,0.0006,4.4191,5.4328,1.5355,1.6273,0.6158,0.2861,0.0002,1.5709,0.5298,3.8397,5.6833,4.8933,0.4855,5.6262,4.4299,1.3402,5.311,0.0003,0.5615,0.0009,6.1885,6.6164,2.6673,0.9716,0.0003,0.0893,0.0008,4.0682,2.2027,0.56,6.3095,0.9405,3.6681,2.8112,2.8123,5.6971,10.9069,1.5481,0.0004,0.3514,0.0013,3.5829,4.3251,0.2711,7.0158,2.0469,1.5325,4.6401,5.3734,2.5222,1.0444,0.3065,0.0225,4.3075,3.4139,0.7338,0.1913,1.4671,1.9847,2.3961,2.0983,3.9712,0.0133,3.2957,3.9025,1.6356,1.6017,0.07,3.7715,5.18,2.9517,2.5228,1.7683,3.1468,5.9292,2.3602,0.0068,5.4614,1.2157,1.531,5.6259,3.5671,4.1452,3.3991,3.4221,1.9549,5.0305,3.0394,6.8247,3.6342,3.5005,3.6336,1.9091,4.3854,5.3818,0.4191]}

One of the two main professors of the department, he was also one of the \" Big Three \" ( with John W. Davis and John M. Streator ) of the American Literary Club, established in New York in January 1875, with Mabel Thackeray Hunt as President. At the University of Chicago he had one of the finest and most successful libraries of English books, which was placed at public disposal by the Chicago Union Trust Company in 1900 and was used for many years. He was not only a great scholar but one who loved words and stories as a lover loves them, perhaps as a consequence of much practice in his earlier writing days. Even in his library he is shown with his pen in hand, as though he were there to collect all the available evidence. The following lines from an address given by Dr. Walpole at the opening of a new University building at Chicago illustrate some of his qualities : \" In every act of the human being as a man or woman we have within us the capacity, the will, and the power to be more than we have been.\" He was fond of saying that he wanted to do the writing to do good writing. It was this characteristic that made him invaluable as an editor and commentator. He could make his own critical notes upon most of the books which he read, at home and abroad. When he was in London in 1875 he said to me that he would write a history of the British Theatre. There seemed to be a little bit left on the table ; it was too big and important a subject to be written by the author of a mere guide-book to London. I suggested that I should help him to the task. We found afterwards that another book for him had been in the air for a long time, that he was too busy to do it ; but I suggested that he should start with a history of English literature which was still more important than a Theatre history. We arranged it to begin with the Elizabethan dramatists. He was too busy to do it and I remained at home for an editorial review of the French Revolution. But with Mr. Gladstone and the Marquis of Lansdowne he read the first draft, and the book was published after his death, and did great work in a most unthrown life.","token_len":529,"entropy":[10.712,9.2696,9.9409,1.4365,1.3323,5.6461,13.7307,9.2625,4.846,8.3326,6.7291,1.8312,2.5129,6.366,3.1326,8.77,5.5641,5.1505,9.9985,0.5127,0.0729,0.5643,2.0883,0.8545,7.1878,1.5998,5.3037,1.7937,4.2218,1.2018,9.3539,0.0291,0.0324,2.0572,6.6833,3.8161,0.7171,4.1906,3.7154,0.1276,9.3542,2.8615,0.3021,1.0424,2.3981,4.2713,0.4042,5.081,2.2114,1.474,4.2323,1.8039,2.5832,4.0254,2.3798,0.0599,1.0512,3.7685,1.2056,0.415,6.3573,1.5698,0.7803,5.2857,0.6305,1.062,5.2893,4.1728,4.2801,1.2829,1.3954,1.6305,0.9529,2.1276,1.18,2.8649,3.7881,0.0207,0.3008,5.6537,12.4984,1.979,0.9174,3.7367,9.6571,4.6502,3.6278,0.253,5.4255,2.1458,2.7787,3.6425,0.1428,4.8563,7.1427,4.5701,1.3343,2.5539,0.6337,2.7839,4.2798,4.6366,1.5704,6.6589,0.6352,5.2994,0.104,0.7039,6.8956,0.6604,2.3985,1.7718,3.381,7.3989,5.9448,7.0136,2.7928,0.024,13.6996,1.1855,4.1976,0.7183,3.6665,0.9794,3.4602,0.3275,0.1145,1.598,3.0443,5.1819,0.6866,0.191,3.3757,3.3049,0.3318,3.6105,4.8321,1.4979,5.4145,6.3193,1.5984,3.3976,1.9789,6.3747,2.4918,9.4631,7.6766,2.0785,0.8719,3.2254,5.9851,7.2225,4.3918,1.2098,5.1652,3.1509,1.9223,3.8891,1.8655,3.1656,0.45,1.8942,1.5586,0.9976,5.2615,0.9971,1.1779,2.6032,2.3621,2.1253,4.1942,4.5459,5.6912,6.5281,1.0812,5.8656,3.0369,4.1193,6.6649,11.3961,2.7448,2.0259,7.3667,3.3411,0.8016,6.976,0.1112,7.5118,5.6038,1.4314,1.4843,6.5247,4.0026,8.0169,0.3759,6.832,2.3214,0.9169,7.1758,2.2847,4.8188,5.7385,4.0526,3.1066,6.4141,1.8643,3.7661,0.7945,2.8976,3.6864,1.4548,0.7518,5.5152,1.1482,5.806,4.458,0.8976,6.7466,4.9234,1.6644,2.811,4.5134,7.3282,1.6484,3.5486,3.9856,1.2768,0.8263,3.6224,0.0616,7.5459,0.0012,2.2046,0.7582,3.9874,0.1443,3.2016,2.6776,5.2319,6.3434,2.7382,2.4753,10.2716,3.7859,0.1141,0.6988,5.239,3.9277,0.9207,4.2703,5.0684,6.6085,0.3509,3.0015,4.3699,3.9169,5.1028,1.4878,2.3978,4.6161,1.6034,3.8393,2.3788,8.0228,1.2551,1.8243,4.5535,3.4016,3.0245,3.4811,0.4232,0.9994,0.2306,3.6872,0.358,4.495,4.4377,1.5136,1.5648,2.825,1.3116,4.4442,2.9254,1.9724,6.6722,0.1758,2.8192,1.1476,2.0665,4.251,0.5978,4.1378,2.5756,6.4525,4.8774,5.5965,4.9665,6.3221,1.4661,3.3596,1.1821,3.6169,6.3247,1.0286,2.3613,0.2207,6.9,3.0192,1.86,1.9956,1.6036,5.7092,1.0262,1.4202,4.5682,3.6129,3.23,2.358,6.8465,3.8105,5.7222,5.4641,1.3331,0.3895,2.8646,2.7361,1.2654,2.2712,1.1704,5.7732,4.3903,1.1721,0.2702,1.0417,4.4062,0.9174,1.1127,2.6101,3.5499,2.8307,0.7181,2.686,0.7591,5.8754,2.2337,2.0705,2.1801,0.8755,2.8157,2.6265,1.7315,5.7581,0.1536,1.192,2.8008,7.246,2.4085,4.706,6.3066,0.3045,0.2669,1.4706,5.176,3.3504,8.2692,3.82,0.7847,2.6463,6.8097,3.2073,0.7718,4.3015,4.4472,2.1029,6.405,2.8061,0.6744,1.1239,1.8199,2.5454,2.787,3.5146,4.087,2.0243,1.5264,5.7338,7.2451,4.2029,0.2526,4.819,5.4606,0.5284,2.6557,4.7402,0.9244,2.8029,1.3401,7.3815,0.5494,1.867,5.3139,3.168,1.3298,4.5242,5.0581,8.4029,0.447,7.2393,4.0742,5.5831,2.4755,2.8623,0.3973,4.6311,0.87,7.7602,1.5296,1.5028,1.8124,0.0763,1.1731,4.4013,2.2258,2.1074,5.3308,0.989,1.6824,2.7228,1.4335,2.9165,1.9684,2.2247,4.459,0.4945,0.7244,0.81,4.8815,3.1799,1.7827,2.8324,0.1553,4.5245,1.6432,3.0335,2.2792,4.262,4.3393,0.7037,0.8613,2.405,14.526,2.6622,0.5969,3.9183,5.3791,4.8402,3.0446,4.7014,0.5068,1.9331,9.5204,0.4057,5.1538,0.1307,0.6179,2.2809,2.1528,2.0664,5.0886,0.3544,0.8533,1.1809,0.7783,3.3454,2.4993,7.6256,3.0113,0.9701,2.8753,4.1604,8.6489,4.0878,1.0401,1.2187,6.3427,4.5551,0.7093,3.7963,5.4243,5.0905,0.0223,6.6411,0.1189,2.1202,3.1212,7.6582,0.1179,1.7045,8.7207,0.0217,0.0131,2.7708,5.8703,1.6277,2.7926,4.3308,2.8087,0.8853,3.4955,4.8137,0.824,1.0945,5.9238,3.1305,0.9741,2.6568,1.7434,6.2502,3.6905,1.127,1.449,4.465,6.3278,5.5788,9.2298,5.7939,7.8441,0.3905]}

However, the \"Futagawa Matsumoto\" in the actual historical and cultural works was in fact the son of Tatsumishi Tatsumasa. The son of Tatsumi Tatsumasa was called \"Futagawa Matsutada\")\n\nAs Futagawa Tatsumishi he debuted the Aiki-jujutsu style against his judo training partner, the Japanese amateur wrestler and former Olympic champion Takuma Aoyama, in July 1884 before the Kano Shihan at Tokyo, and after that he won a number of other matches against high-level opponents such as Tsubocha Yataro (1857-1905), Masaru Hayashi (1864-1905), and Sode no Seisai Kunio (1859-1927) of the J\u014dd\u014d (Judo) school who were said to be \"in his class\".\n\nFutagawa's most famous early victory came against the famous r\u014dnin (master-less criminal) Kyokushin r\u014dgi (1859-1922), in April 1887, near Matsumoto, and resulted in the famous Futagawa Tatsumoshi's becoming \"The First Futagawa\" (Kami-no-Futagawa), his own style name.\n\nAs one of the great masters of Aikido, and having been trained under Kano Jigoro Sensei Futagawa Tatsumichi has become the symbol of Aiki-jujutsu.

{"id":4847,"ended":false,"length":450,"text":"The bass aria, `` < unk > ich < unk > und Pein `` ( Although I experience the fear and torment of Hell ), is accompanied by the continuo. It expresses the idea of the suffering of Hell itself. Although it does not tell us who will experience the torment of Hell, it speaks of Christ `` who will deliver us from the power of the devil `` ; it also refers to Hell being destroyed `` for those of the nations who believe ``. The bass aria has a strong effect, and it expresses the great power of this music. It is performed by a choir of female and male vocalists, accompanied by one or two cellos, two violins, a flute and a double bass. The chorus is accompanied by the orchestra on the harp duet as on the theme to the Aria `` Laetitia,`` and on a fugue played by the orchestra. The last part of the music is a fugue played by the orchestra on the bass ( and possibly on the soprano oboe ), which may have been improvised. The oboe also plays the third part solo. The bass aria is followed by a fugue for woodwinds, which brings to a close the Cantiones. The four cantiones contain one movement each. The first is a short, but intense canticle where the voice emphasizes the refrain `` Pein, Pein.`` The second is a lengthy canticle, with ``Ein kleiner Traum wischt mich ab``, ``Mein Traum wird sterben`` and ``Bergaben gehen wie die Welt``. The third is a short, but powerful canticle where the voice emphasizes the refrain `` Mein Traum wird sterben.`` The fourth is a long canticle with ``Einen kleinen Traum gegen die Welt``. The canticles are performed on the bass, the violin and the cello. The chorus is on the harp. At this point, the singers sing the first verse of each canticle in unison. This is an important moment in the cycle because it expresses the idea of Christ `` who will deliver us from the devil `` during the entire course of the Cantiones.\n\nRecordings\n\n'This is a series of recordings of the complete Passion cycle from its beginnings in 1394 to its completion in 1544 and the performance of a...'Both a superbly sung recording and an astonishing feat of scholarship.

{"id":4018,"ended":true,"length":464,"text":"The strength and range of the electric force and the good conductivity of plasmas usually ensure that the densities of positive and negative charges in any sizeable region are equal ( `` < unk >`` ). When the electric field between electrodes is large, charge can be trapped by an electric-field trap ( `` < unk > `` ).\n\nThere are two types of traps: ``< unk >'' traps (i.e., ``> + +'' ) and ``< unk >''less-than-equilibrium traps (``< - < unk >'' and ``< - < unk >''). The density of both types of traps is proportional to the charge-energy density of the plasma. The trapping mechanism that occurs in the < unk > traps depends on the magnitude of the electric field. In the < unk > less-than-equilibrium traps, the electron density tends to decrease with the applied field while the positive ions are accelerated. In the more widely-seen < unk > traps, the electron density may increase due to increased plasma-electrostatic interactions and plasma expansion. The existence of < unk > traps has been postulated for a number of plasmas in the Earth and outer space, but there have been few direct experiments that have unambiguously supported the hypothesis. However, in many plasmas observed in the Earth, an ``< - < unk >''like distribution appears to hold ``close enough'' for a considerable fraction of the time. Using the measured charge-energy densities for many of the plasma constituents and the plasma parameters, we have determined that the ratio of the charged-particle densities in the Earth to near Earth space in the neutral gas and the ionized state is of the following order of magnitude: ``< unk >'' ~ `` < unk > <= 1 +1, ``< unk >'' ~ `` < unk > <= 1 < unk >`` (where ``< unk >'' ~ is the measured background density.). The observed near-Earth plasma ``< - >`` value is much smaller than ``< unk >'' < unk >. In general, the plasma density varies near an equilibrium between neutral and excited species, while the ratio of ion plasma densities in the excited state versus the neutral state depends on the temperature. If the ratio of the plasma densities can be obtained in the vicinity of an ``< - >``like condition, it may be an indication of ``< - >`` less-than-equilibrium trapping in the Earth's plasma.","token_len":530,"entropy":[8.6695,1.8922,6.1832,0.1027,1.1388,6.8097,6.8704,4.002,1.4586,8.4235,5.5114,0.0645,0.1352,9.2077,2.0925,0.1796,8.1546,7.5194,0.6296,1.244,9.9783,1.0694,0.6025,7.1251,0.7629,0.0155,1.5432,3.1411,4.4874,11.9752,5.0911,1.3661,4.4158,4.4242,15.8935,8.7987,8.3635,6.1198,5.0813,7.8792,1.2438,4.4148,1.5638,2.5052,1.2153,4.5524,4.7905,0.4872,2.6643,1.1118,6.302,3.3541,0.905,4.8829,2.5568,4.0349,3.0796,6.082,1.8501,5.9746,2.4559,2.9051,1.1272,1.2513,0.0257,0.0323,2.0576,0.4034,2.8505,0.0021,4.5605,0.4918,1.3477,2.2591,0.0068,5.045,1.9025,3.1086,4.5818,0.8746,0.0044,0.0728,2.8552,1.806,2.6348,3.4882,0.0163,0.0012,0.1479,1.9318,4.8267,7.4538,6.9247,1.5633,3.7734,0.3896,0.0455,0.1988,0.3766,0.0017,0.1483,0.5541,14.6058,2.6656,1.3942,1.1269,4.6563,1.4434,0.4068,0.1103,2.9801,1.0536,5.0288,2.8954,0.34,0.0006,0.0185,2.852,5.0074,0.0396,0.2946,0.548,0.3031,0.2035,0.0008,0.0319,0.2726,1.8182,1.3048,8.2095,0.3493,4.5748,2.0375,0.5256,0.4087,1.3062,2.9254,0.0268,0.1783,3.56,3.4793,3.2108,2.9971,0.9114,0.2873,5.9064,1.2952,1.3503,6.7675,6.3284,4.446,4.6287,1.3658,1.0165,5.8931,0.6041,0.0011,0.1173,3.3425,2.606,0.3525,0.2693,5.4009,0.1611,0.2077,2.3945,0.1257,1.6386,2.4954,1.2265,0.8057,0.2906,0.0017,0.0814,7.9796,0.4277,0.0035,0.0031,0.0356,0.0075,0.4678,0.3177,0.4811,5.2292,2.8896,5.4718,0.1368,1.6784,2.2846,1.1599,8.1571,2.652,5.8965,0.3847,5.8085,5.5896,2.1572,6.2019,1.5144,0.9122,0.1189,4.5082,7.7587,4.1035,7.9679,0.5275,0.2963,0.0011,0.0516,0.6093,0.1401,0.3688,1.3702,0.0922,4.8578,0.8656,5.0537,0.0029,3.9037,4.1765,3.3529,2.1735,1.0316,1.1953,2.4844,2.9175,5.1406,6.1591,0.5745,1.7614,8.1809,0.0376,3.8823,0.289,0.0023,0.0402,1.2549,3.3064,0.7416,7.3879,0.0019,2.3237,2.1358,1.4505,0.001,8.4133,0.1059,0.0043,2.7763,1.1586,7.6288,3.2725,7.8873,1.2514,1.5469,1.0061,3.0529,2.1641,0.3279,2.7967,4.744,1.3753,3.1306,1.0466,8.129,0.4692,0.0002,5.2211,1.1488,3.0021,0.8347,3.6662,0.0086,2.9804,3.5741,2.6149,0.0084,0.0092,6.648,1.2424,0.8583,2.6996,1.2279,4.7155,9.4801,1.9101,1.2231,0.2268,0.1688,0.0011,0.0413,0.2709,8.7989,8.6147,3.3726,1.8408,5.041,9.7323,6.2429,2.9043,1.0363,2.5965,2.8593,6.7918,3.5739,0.0251,0.508,3.9758,1.5298,6.651,1.8869,6.6421,2.5106,0.529,0.1933,2.162,0.0014,2.6577,4.5726,1.711,0.4139,4.3058,8.7093,3.4259,1.2344,3.2948,5.9808,1.9816,0.8853,2.1259,2.2929,0.6533,0.8328,5.2906,0.4559,1.3306,3.0571,2.7582,7.2819,0.199,2.5827,0.0009,1.9689,0.905,2.792,1.1825,8.9614,5.3259,7.2611,4.2766,0.8907,9.0246,5.6398,3.6478,2.2021,4.3228,2.1013,3.4951,1.7929,5.9066,1.3225,5.2672,0.3989,2.8961,0.3508,0.467,5.5336,1.403,0.6516,0.0005,0.0107,1.6392,5.9263,6.5356,1.602,0.3272,0.0006,0.0166,9.1343,3.6645,5.5539,7.1505,3.7236,4.7663,0.2635,0.6109,0.0006,0.0066,0.5218,0.6705,0.4079,0.3291,0.1019,0.0006,0.0042,1.0686,1.2925,4.0651,0.9178,0.0005,0.0943,2.2967,2.3814,4.1397,1.3993,0.4054,1.0901,0.0008,0.0644,0.3645,7.9745,3.484,0.4971,5.553,10.1337,2.3056,6.9309,1.5572,5.064,7.306,0.4214,0.5716,0.9721,10.4884,0.4957,1.4517,7.1783,3.4712,6.9308,0.8939,4.718,2.435,0.1783,7.5319,0.1176,0.2771,0.0007,0.0079,0.9892,5.0376,0.294,0.0013,0.0514,2.9884,2.7731,3.2074,0.042,0.7881,2.3034,1.0593,4.3602,7.3794,4.9417,2.4931,3.848,4.449,0.2612,6.0534,8.4017,1.8434,3.6321,0.6746,5.8655,0.4785,4.8366,6.3665,1.9007,0.0019,1.3377,0.4051,6.1605,0.9388,7.6636,1.5666,2.2863,0.4861,3.8905,0.4167,0.3024,5.4005,2.2989,4.3683,0.6316,4.364,0.7389,2.6457,1.8292,2.8025,0.0027,6.3546,0.1509,4.2529,2.3693,0.9249,5.2123,0.0241,1.7286,7.3585,0.192,0.4182,3.7453,1.1425,4.1416,4.7883,0.3139,2.7067,2.8343,0.3356,6.4289,2.3354,0.7702,6.4711,3.1814,1.2934,3.6729,0.4674,5.6221,0.9841,0.0081,0.0212,0.1623,0.0019,2.3826,3.4367,0.5764,2.6752,1.5077,1.6792,0.5124]}
{"id":4981,"ended":false,"length":444,"text":"On September 23, another depression formed. It took a northeasterly path, rotating around the southern periphery of Hurricane Irah as part of a Fujiwara interaction. It strengthened into a tropical storm by the evening on the 23rd, then into a hurricane a few hours later. The next day it attained peak intensity, while continuing a northwesterly track, while having the convection well embedded in the deep convection being exposed due to a northwesterly wind shear.\n\nThe cyclone maintained this intensity for several hours, before degenerating into a tropical depression by early on the morning on the 24th. Shortly later it was absorbed by a high pressure area over the Indian Ocean.\n\nIn the West Pacific basin the depression was part of an interaction and was a Fujiwara interaction to form Hurricane Irah, making its first landfall at Vanuatu at a peak intensity of 115\u00a0km\/h (70\u00a0mph) on October 1.\n\nMeteorological History\n\nIn August and September, small storm systems were identified in the Central Pacific. The first of these systems was an elongated area of low pressure located about 1200\u00a0km (745\u00a0mi) east of Tahiti. An associated low level trough was located about 1800\u00a0km (1175\u00a0mi) south of the trough, while a deep layer cyclonic circulation was located approximately 300\u00a0km (185\u00a0mi) north of the system. On the 22nd, the initial area of low pressure entered a moderate phase of development. The system moved west into the South Pacific basin. An eye feature developed on the 23rd. The system was upgraded to a tropical depression, then a tropical storm by the next day.\n\nHurricane Irah\nAt the time Hurricane Irah was approaching Hawaii, the tropical depression moved north into the warm waters associated with the circulation of Hurricane Irah. As the depression moved into warm waters in the center of the hurricane, the convection became more organized around the center and the system intensified into a hurricane. At this point, the depression was no longer contained in the depression, and it became a remnant low. It dissipated shortly thereafter.\n\nRemnants of the depression initially dissipated before re-entering the basin on October 1 through the Fujiwara interaction.\n\nMeteorological data\n\nImpact\nThere was no immediate reports of damage or casualties.

It is possible to connect from Ashdod to Jerusalem (15 \u2013 35 minutes), Eilat, Tel Aviv \u2013 Haifa, Lod, Haifa, Netanya, Nahariya, Kiryat Ono, Raanana, Beit She'an, Acre, and Ashkelon.\n\nContents\n\nAs part of the Arab-Israeli war of 1948 the British Mandate over Palestine was overthrown and Israel was annexed to the United Kingdom. After the defeat of the invading Arab forces and the surrender of the remaining Arabs of Palestine, a British-administered \"Transitional Government\" presided over by David Ben-Gurion and his Likud Party, was established on 14 May 1948.[2][3] The Government's brief was to implement Jewish immigration to the Palestine Mandate and British control over the country.[4]\n\nThis railway was designed and built by Israel, with British supervision and technical support.\n\nIsrael Railways operates the railway, which is currently operated in a subsidized mode. As of 2012 it was expected that the railway would be partially privatized.[5] Under a privatization initiative being developed by the Israel Ministry of Finance (MFN) and Israel Railways, only freight lines will be privatized, which means that passenger service to Ashdod-Jerusalem (including the Tzfat-Jerusalem line) would continue to be subsidized by the Israeli government and operated by Israel Railways. However, the Israeli government also plans to allow passenger service to be operated by private entities, and it is envisioned that Israel Railways would lease lines to private operators.[6]\n\nThe railway was constructed of precast concrete, and it was built by Israel Railways' civil engineering division, which constructed all of Israel's railways. It has four main lines and many short branch routes.\n\nA four-carriage electric train leaves Ma'aleh Adumim every 20 minutes for Ashdod. The line was extended from Ein Karem to the northern terminus of Nahariya station. The railway line to Ashdod from Ma'aleh Adumim is part of a short branch of the Tzfat\u2013Jerusalem line, which includes the line to Ein Yahav.","token_len":532,"entropy":[10.0737,8.9133,6.3139,2.1196,7.4569,4.0337,0.0186,8.9763,1.0303,4.7107,3.8825,1.656,7.5608,0.177,0.6104,8.1929,1.3606,5.5706,9.8823,1.4748,6.549,0.0253,0.0008,4.5511,2.4699,1.4904,4.3807,9.3773,7.6171,0.5905,0.7444,16.7856,9.4933,6.7274,6.4874,7.2882,8.3925,2.178,6.9067,2.7155,0.1019,3.4502,5.0739,0.2888,3.8624,0.8712,5.2724,2.1424,7.2784,2.3276,3.403,1.3833,3.4618,0.4773,9.4375,4.6698,4.7398,2.7522,2.4263,2.4438,0.4674,6.1901,0.7572,6.0142,7.1227,2.2752,3.2879,2.4086,0.0604,7.6895,0.4938,3.2002,2.2906,4.2553,0.7277,3.2619,0.9602,2.9755,4.2518,1.1212,0.0177,0.0005,0.709,2.9357,4.2177,6.6049,6.9132,4.5329,2.5215,2.427,6.0652,0.7229,0.0085,2.3653,3.0387,0.3428,5.2354,1.5295,0.0027,1.2733,8.2435,0.83,2.64,0.006,0.9458,5.6902,0.0078,0.9204,6.3296,1.7013,0.905,0.6436,6.1932,0.0174,0.0108,8.0071,4.1022,0.7146,8.0511,5.3171,4.0636,0.4873,4.0973,0.511,1.1309,3.1726,0.8928,0.4883,9.2412,1.5391,0.7028,3.3796,3.4784,2.0148,0.0003,0.5299,1.9725,0.0039,8.0647,1.3007,0.0002,6.404,3.7908,0.0015,0.4672,6.7087,2.8583,0.0826,5.2035,2.024,1.7275,3.2968,5.4126,3.9825,0.0014,6.117,2.2248,0.7707,6.5147,0.0024,1.9108,2.939,1.1043,2.296,1.8653,0.682,2.8938,2.4298,1.1573,3.7871,0.9473,4.8453,0.0776,0.3797,6.8311,3.4489,1.9726,3.3743,0.6556,4.9689,0.1402,0.8599,5.7928,3.045,4.4763,0.9659,0.9405,3.4792,3.4726,1.786,2.8229,0.0179,4.2356,7.5663,1.3369,1.9074,0.2175,6.859,0.0446,0.6017,4.2462,1.7183,0.3059,0.0307,0.0001,2.9719,2.5865,6.7908,0.0117,0.0001,2.0344,2.0389,3.543,0.8808,3.7932,4.762,2.344,0.6444,6.2136,2.47,3.1731,0.1471,0.3203,1.6365,4.5809,3.7553,9.0458,3.5543,1.3916,5.0082,5.3608,3.4893,3.1093,1.0712,4.5383,7.3199,0.0057,1.8584,6.5636,2.8403,0.9212,0.7863,3.5887,2.0322,0.145,0.2021,1.3953,0.0001,4.9096,10.6482,2.0767,4.1492,2.2737,0.5996,0.8835,4.7212,2.7515,2.618,5.4996,6.8882,1.7769,5.2361,2.0825,1.1406,2.7603,0.0001,5.4687,1.7308,0.0402,5.078,2.3037,5.4229,3.6274,1.3534,1.5219,4.5931,1.8708,3.3066,3.2069,9.7381,3.7293,1.6445,4.5054,0.7529,4.0595,2.3064,2.2975,5.3837,1.5417,1.4655,3.5484,0.6221,1.2212,5.4794,2.7023,1.1261,2.9398,0.1754,0.1522,6.219,3.3342,5.6151,5.2732,6.2203,3.2437,0.6959,0.9417,3.7502,4.707,0.0701,1.8286,2.4854,1.6915,6.4699,1.2631,2.0321,4.1321,1.914,0.0304,1.2732,5.9179,6.9065,5.1258,2.3833,0.2683,3.8885,0.028,1.7085,3.3262,2.0526,0.5588,5.9234,3.7317,2.4523,1.3636,0.0107,0.0003,5.3324,2.9718,0.0242,3.2873,4.0023,1.6047,5.6833,2.1132,8.9047,2.5945,3.6852,0.0743,2.1465,0.4495,3.5076,3.5521,1.2356,0.4136,4.065,1.9033,0.6907,2.3576,0.6189,2.8831,3.9206,0.7682,3.5,0.8989,0.0049,0.7342,3.7494,0.1019,1.5385,3.7186,1.0881,4.389,2.0202,0.0799,4.9983,3.5524,0.7426,0.3696,3.5715,2.3564,0.9972,2.7015,4.1445,1.7311,3.0278,3.5404,0.9572,7.3935,0.0868,4.7092,0.1677,0.0023,2.0071,6.1189,6.4323,1.0189,1.1992,2.6619,3.0302,0.1141,0.1243,0.4728,0.0001,1.7324,3.1656,2.2365,2.9231,4.7425,7.7345,4.8,0.623,1.395,1.9323,3.0399,1.6497,2.3592,2.8346,2.9227,1.7613,0.0046,4.2152,7.8258,0.4796,3.1175,1.3568,1.7928,6.4045,4.9366,1.6726,4.7568,0.2791,3.459,1.6351,2.2312,2.6935,4.2363,2.2965,3.8968,3.4048,6.0981,5.4281,9.145,3.3248,1.2726,1.7405,0.0001,3.716,5.8348,0.1895,3.3201,1.5806,5.9955,1.553,7.0918,8.0503,0.3973,0.1354,0.4275,0.2697,0.1816,0.0257,6.5509,3.5496,0.1774,3.3777,1.1141,0.0211,0.0011,1.746,1.5077,3.5286,4.0209,5.2235,1.7181,3.8321,4.0293,2.9761,0.7503,0.8189,2.915,4.3601,4.1187,0.0052,0.3688,7.2517,0.043,0.0235,4.364,1.7656,1.3856,4.6148,3.8562,5.149,1.1415,0.0116,0.002,3.7125,2.8777,0.0032,0.0307,0.0016,0.0665,0.0013,0.0041,1.6527,5.5356,0.0024,1.7102,5.9901,2.816,3.2158,0.4153,4.1503,0.0506,0.0847,5.9879,0.0942,0.0057,0.4017,1.6195,0.9436,5.0445,1.0716,5.1853,1.0924,2.8818,0.4753,9.6206,5.7841,1.8568]}

{"id":380,"ended":true,"length":470,"text":"Morning @ - @ Room at the Manor House, Woolton Arriving in pursuit of her daughter, Lady Bracknell is astonished to be told that Algernon and Cecily are engaged. The revelation of young people's engagement is a new experience to her, she has always been one to disapprove of the practice, but it will take much gentle persuasion from Cecily and Lord Bracknell to change her mind, and when Miss Mortimer arrives for breakfast with the news that the marriage plans have moved on without Mrs Norris, she believes that everything will be smoothed over and that she will be allowed to continue her morning siesta.\n\nIt seems that Lord Bracknell has found a suitable bride for his grandson, however, when he learns that the bride to be will be Miss Prissy Mortimer, who is to be Cecily's maid of honour, he has words with his son : \"I can think of no one to marry out of that house! The family should be ashamed of themselves! They ought to be glad of Mrs Norris's presence, if they would only let her continue in it \".\n\nHe is so angry that he refuses to meet Algernon or Cecily when they have an introduction and to join in tea. At night Algernon asks him about what has happened and where things stand. They decide that he should go as far away as possible from the Manor House, and as soon as it is possible, they should all leave for New Zealand. But they decide that Cecily and Algernon must stay until this matter is dealt with.\n\nIt would appear that Algernon is not satisfied that Cecily has forgiven him and the decision by her family to marry off her brother. He begins by showing the young people the way to the drawing room where he proposes to have a talk with Cecily.\n\nCecily has invited the whole household to have tea with them and she is hoping that Algernon will explain the situation. Lord Bracknell has said that the best thing for Algernon would be to leave the Manor House. Cecily hopes that their relationship has improved enough for Algernon to stay.\n\nAlgernon then says he must talk to his brother and her family and asks for some time alone. He is in an agony of indecision as he has promised his sister that he would try to win her back.

These include an expansion on her background and early life in the book Night Terrors [ edit ]\n\nShe appears in Star Trek : The Next Generation Companion, a Star Trek novel by Larry Nemecek.\n\nContents show]\n\nBackground Edit\n\nRo was the captain of a Federation-run space station in the Gamma Quadrant. The station was located near the Gamma Quadrant border, near the site of the recent First Contact War. She and her crew kept to the letter of every treaty between Federation and Cardassian forces, but as a result only allowed Cardassian ships limited access to the station's power network.\n\nWhen it was discovered that the Cardassian military was not enforcing the ban on its ships approaching the station, Ro decided to take action. She shut down a Cardassian weapons array near the station allowing Cardassian ships to approach much closer to the station.\n\nOnce she had convinced the Cardassians, Ro tried to prevent any further violations of the treaty, but was unable to maintain peace. She was, however, aware that the station was being used to store Federation goods smuggled from the Klingon occupation of Gamma Quadrant.\n\nOn one of Ro's missions, she went to check in on the station's cargo. She was attacked by an unknown assailant before she could take her cargo. She tried to escape in the cargo ship and was held at Cardassian gunpoint by a Cardassian crew member. During the fight the other crewmembers on the ship betrayed their captain.\n\nThey were forced to hand over a Federation transporter key. Ro used the transporter to materialize the transporter lock onto the cargo ship and fled.\n\nAppearances Edit\n\nA member of the crew first appeared in \"Night Terrors\", first broadcast on May 5, 1994.\n\nBehind the scenes Edit\n\nIn her appearance, Ro's gender was initially ambiguous. By the time of the scene, it was clear she was a male.\n\n\"Night Terrors\" was written with an intention to get Ro killed. After working the idea out with the director they decided to go with an alternative ending.\n\nRo's character is loosely based on actress Denise Crosby, who was actually the first pick to play Ro before she was unavailable for filming. This came back to haunt Ro during \"A Matter of Perspective\", a scene in which a young Ro made a request to her mother regarding her future career. This scene, written for Denise Crosby to film, was reshot with Janice Rand.\n\nTrivia Edit","token_len":534,"entropy":[8.9042,1.5171,4.9495,0.018,5.2067,0.7875,1.4408,8.0987,14.7766,9.359,5.7441,10.3902,6.506,2.0382,6.9433,0.1818,3.7159,6.5165,1.3973,1.4964,4.9142,2.2782,4.5738,6.8434,3.3759,4.9399,6.4462,2.3961,6.4227,1.4643,2.1938,1.8149,5.9914,11.1577,6.2989,0.0316,6.9585,3.938,0.1137,0.0527,0.0006,3.3379,2.9337,0.6226,5.8014,1.4811,5.26,1.5516,0.2376,0.0011,3.3822,1.9419,3.3029,4.1166,0.1149,2.9882,2.9157,6.8681,7.2357,2.5931,2.0211,0.0135,1.0262,1.1454,0.0003,3.4273,0.002,0.001,0.0033,0.0003,1.2009,1.1773,0.0006,0.0001,9.0208,1.3089,3.6812,5.4461,0.0828,1.7669,4.516,3.1284,2.8352,2.639,0.6717,2.3235,0.7375,3.5564,0.0282,0.005,1.139,3.1675,0.6491,0.6483,3.9171,3.3037,0.7188,4.2386,0.4275,0.0094,6.317,1.4615,3.7121,0.6205,5.6117,0.0829,0.5405,6.1378,7.3061,0.1587,3.988,0.768,2.2218,3.2379,1.0212,0.4485,6.7729,3.8704,1.3461,8.9203,1.0146,6.8465,2.9898,3.3806,3.903,0.2615,6.0614,0.0531,2.4041,1.3059,2.5409,4.8308,2.5711,1.2331,5.5591,6.447,3.7572,0.6455,2.7687,10.3396,0.2381,0.278,0.5134,0.3261,2.9291,4.861,5.8118,0.4254,2.0229,0.0001,3.5538,4.7884,0.493,2.2309,0.3806,1.0305,2.2969,0.6186,4.4505,1.2085,4.0862,6.8828,1.1683,6.2944,0.3458,5.5641,3.2159,6.5257,0.3332,0.0807,0.3251,0.494,3.3236,0.157,3.1702,2.1432,0.7496,0.9853,7.436,0.2571,2.9573,1.8939,0.0035,7.1697,5.7268,3.5095,0.0938,0.2132,8.5132,2.1197,0.2978,1.7984,0.3275,4.4088,8.2106,1.5371,0.6121,0.2123,0.1527,0.7727,2.5401,0.0002,5.472,2.6442,1.8766,6.5139,0.798,0.4157,1.1124,0.0207,4.3559,2.7628,5.442,0.1777,4.5905,3.3504,2.3839,6.2081,0.53,0.2674,0.4074,1.5865,0.6438,1.5795,3.6768,0.0666,6.3561,4.2359,1.3662,1.3543,1.7835,6.1727,0.1009,0.004,5.4948,0.9161,1.2794,5.0395,0.7841,2.8824,0.5912,1.6775,2.802,4.1751,5.6389,8.6246,1.8486,0.8565,5.2599,5.9309,1.2729,4.6769,0.5111,0.0052,0.7243,1.7424,0.0001,4.3877,3.7938,2.0992,3.2811,0.0041,3.0063,1.3013,1.0036,5.0374,0.5563,5.4793,3.6761,0.6661,1.3301,2.0912,1.1486,3.6583,2.2053,1.6187,1.712,3.9284,0.1121,2.3911,2.486,1.1457,4.8385,1.0647,1.0816,3.9018,2.0325,6.1468,1.1626,1.6313,4.1201,0.1107,1.6683,4.2454,1.6347,2.5418,3.2538,2.2275,1.3494,5.9703,3.3183,11.9047,0.4639,7.3485,0.8977,1.8503,1.8556,0.8694,0.0153,4.032,1.2421,0.6975,4.859,0.7399,2.44,4.1936,5.1732,0.6247,1.8574,6.5153,1.0603,0.887,7.9887,2.4875,4.1125,1.8296,1.3205,0.0001,5.2631,1.8545,3.2429,0.0868,5.6245,0.1692,3.5978,6.0808,5.9115,4.7571,3.0468,1.4919,3.7471,1.2415,4.2264,1.0394,11.0375,0.1058,1.4528,4.2241,4.5652,5.2457,0.7319,2.5878,0.6039,1.9737,6.1712,1.5047,1.4475,0.0001,5.5493,0.1743,0.0464,0.0002,4.9065,6.3764,0.0139,0.429,2.0552,7.7386,2.08,0.2038,3.2836,3.9447,0.0345,0.0,1.5876,5.2104,6.2511,1.2473,3.7937,3.2739,0.0502,3.6482,0.5131,0.7892,0.0002,4.9258,0.0028,0.0545,0.0034,0.0448,0.0001,3.0061,4.4276,4.4834,1.5067,0.5603,2.4414,4.829,1.7933,3.0106,4.5421,0.8569,6.2747,0.7302,0.544,1.5933,0.7639,7.2909,1.7029,2.5374,0.5397,2.1897,2.6084,0.305,1.429,1.8521,1.1813,1.5883,0.0002,4.7602,0.5658,0.0049,0.0001,0.0753,1.199,2.249,3.7202,3.326,5.152,0.6571,6.1013,2.8469,7.7109,1.5728,4.9517,6.3531,4.2713,5.9546,2.3011,2.1213,1.8569,4.6791,9.6562,1.0019,0.6557,3.0839,0.567,2.6441,3.938,2.1941,1.147,1.4711,0.0002,1.9426,1.2809,2.7971,2.0243,6.9032,0.0871,0.1225,4.4407,6.056,0.389,1.159,0.5577,2.6598,5.7653,2.7941,2.7054,9.8546,1.4316,0.7621,2.0158,5.9966,1.4952,0.9431,11.8223,1.0894,4.1639,0.3772,4.1819,6.172,5.5764,0.8657,1.2626,2.853,3.8478,3.9327,4.6938,4.1381,0.0313,3.469,1.174,3.4141,2.5721,1.2992,0.078,4.1126,2.8401,4.3997,6.8007,0.9023,6.0693,0.7127,2.219,2.5702,5.5523,1.1268,3.1486,3.1081,0.4835,3.8384,3.8044,3.2451,4.5164,3.172,4.9328,0.1952,5.3408,5.6088,1.072,1.1917,8.3488,0.531,2.9658,8.8902,2.3792,8.7255,3.2156,0.6879,0.0002,5.2169,0.0425]}

It's just like, if Alice and I play every once in a while, then we play Alice in Chains, if we're up for it, and if the other members are up for it and everything, but everything is on the line to see how it 'll all work...\n\nSigler said, \u201cWhat I got to admit to you is they're doing a live album, which is something I've wanted to do in years. They're really into it. They're trying all kinds of crazy stuff, they've got a producer that's kind or a live guy, they want to do this thing in real time and it's the most exciting thing I've seen in a long time...\n\nKroeger further explained where Alice in Chains stands today musically, telling the audience, `` We're always figuring out the next thing. `` I know there's been...\n\nThe band \u2018 s original lineup, minus Layne Staley, will play songs from its 1995 self-titled debut, and also material from its latest album'Black Gives Way to Blue '. The album debuted at # 7 on the Billboard 200 and sold over 30,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nHe made many friends with some of his famous friends along the way. Jerry Lee Lewis recorded one of his versions. And the Rolling Stones covered another. We also got to tour Europe for the first time in a long time. I've just been feeling good. I wanted to do shows. I wasn't even trying to do anything in the next year or so. That was just where my head was at. Now we're looking through the fall.\n\nThe pair met in November 2008 and tied the knot last August. Their marriage ceremony took place on the lawn of Soho House in West Hollywood and they shared a cocktail reception in the estate s garden. `I married her because I love her and I love that part of her in a way that can be seen as romantic or as whatever,'' he told People.com. `She's smart and she's funny.","token_len":534,"entropy":[8.0569,3.8653,0.1537,10.7805,2.0454,6.7596,2.2474,7.0182,1.141,0.2248,11.2378,3.4461,1.7175,1.8214,7.1708,3.9018,0.6321,7.5145,3.0333,0.0448,3.1651,1.1566,6.241,0.0029,0.4688,3.1813,3.6365,2.1856,9.136,9.8738,1.5165,9.9928,4.9067,2.6624,9.3683,2.743,3.0746,2.471,5.1493,3.8817,2.0562,3.7088,0.0013,4.1188,1.6931,0.1276,0.2778,5.5186,0.813,1.488,6.343,0.0141,1.2793,1.0828,3.5833,0.258,5.7936,0.2171,1.5951,6.9003,2.7934,7.6585,0.4851,4.1671,0.3765,4.5834,5.8996,3.9501,2.5789,6.1805,5.2731,0.0025,7.136,2.6384,3.4236,2.0109,3.8271,0.5495,4.0112,9.3041,7.7825,0.5042,2.8236,2.8083,5.4188,10.0605,10.789,0.052,5.6946,1.6767,0.5308,2.4386,2.1735,5.9867,2.7075,6.7872,1.6339,4.6242,2.467,2.6878,6.7147,2.4397,1.4631,6.5508,0.8161,3.3487,5.3577,1.9337,2.4551,0.3504,2.9597,2.9746,1.2228,4.5946,3.6171,3.7325,0.5511,5.6563,5.2248,6.8246,0.0712,0.5295,0.0094,0.4994,3.7011,1.2537,5.8626,8.9566,1.5439,0.3395,2.2446,3.6688,1.1777,2.9798,5.2067,1.912,0.9395,1.2441,2.1302,1.7178,3.7943,2.7287,4.3311,1.9451,0.6594,0.043,0.0258,3.8246,5.9885,1.1977,5.0691,6.835,1.8694,3.3825,0.988,2.5076,4.5269,4.4134,2.1019,0.8323,8.7224,4.3273,3.6564,1.2855,5.8229,1.4461,0.0002,6.3254,6.3247,7.5115,3.1586,1.0527,12.7243,7.9649,5.6754,2.3334,5.7283,1.9626,7.3286,3.0804,1.3885,0.9377,5.0251,1.3053,3.2718,1.4182,4.2541,0.9857,1.6854,2.8773,0.7899,3.327,1.5439,1.5808,4.5964,0.2871,0.3111,3.4471,3.9843,0.9232,2.5764,1.2717,3.6503,3.5095,1.7504,0.9651,1.8501,1.0293,3.5216,6.9372,1.674,0.0102,2.7283,1.4871,1.2642,3.5067,2.4681,0.9719,1.4824,6.2589,2.5161,0.7861,5.191,10.5092,2.3433,6.6896,3.5248,1.3271,2.1507,3.9733,0.3327,1.4809,3.6672,2.941,3.8927,4.4965,0.8336,2.8144,2.1642,0.5101,4.4753,2.5699,1.9444,0.3047,1.7492,0.1186,3.1084,1.7984,0.9256,0.4232,0.0543,3.6775,0.8154,0.0001,5.9912,6.6627,2.6536,7.7445,1.5552,8.7471,1.7986,1.5347,0.0006,3.7249,3.0469,10.7989,0.0448,1.4012,4.4155,3.2856,3.8483,0.4192,0.8386,3.2223,1.0508,4.1996,6.9864,0.3623,2.8652,2.6013,1.6148,1.2607,8.3497,3.1995,3.7639,3.1706,0.6457,3.2137,8.2886,1.4903,0.0002,3.2891,3.128,10.5305,5.1981,7.9259,8.9047,3.3342,2.553,6.2188,9.3779,1.6991,5.8618,3.5762,0.9687,4.4563,2.6248,7.3018,0.9438,6.142,7.0207,5.02,0.0191,0.0397,0.0001,0.9296,2.7092,3.1074,3.9387,9.355,0.3329,1.6953,5.5381,1.1474,9.5549,10.5,6.6713,3.8035,4.56,2.1783,4.6395,8.6279,2.3832,3.0416,5.3133,0.5084,1.8637,7.4332,0.1634,0.3525,0.2121,0.5028,1.8542,3.1762,1.4694,4.5295,1.3382,0.0145,0.1134,1.533,0.5903,0.214,0.3132,1.4592,0.2762,0.5599,1.5934,0.0006,6.4309,6.8265,5.6367,5.0617,2.1289,6.6147,0.1263,2.3766,6.7753,2.5257,5.84,0.1197,0.0562,1.6762,8.5405,2.7079,0.0171,6.4162,4.8523,0.2373,1.1668,8.3858,5.9758,4.4065,3.4674,4.7239,0.0935,5.2051,5.0814,2.0173,5.4085,3.7635,2.4892,1.0402,6.4938,6.913,2.7562,1.6548,1.2116,0.0157,1.6927,2.3531,1.5501,0.0619,0.9206,3.7511,2.7796,4.8096,1.1564,5.227,3.2513,2.0673,1.7764,6.073,0.1043,1.8825,7.5128,2.7841,0.9009,5.0714,0.0013,3.6417,4.1107,0.1907,2.0168,1.6084,4.0119,1.4433,6.8012,2.098,1.0941,1.0309,0.7105,3.9882,1.2613,2.5921,5.8405,3.1679,3.1822,0.2,0.6927,0.7219,5.0873,3.5192,0.4229,5.2775,5.6793,1.5879,8.1594,1.6925,1.4427,0.0003,2.8441,7.8252,4.857,1.6501,5.689,3.7224,2.2231,8.0866,0.5839,0.0121,4.0628,3.5991,0.552,4.0595,4.8606,8.6889,1.3822,0.0291,2.1145,1.7272,6.4714,0.4388,6.023,2.069,3.9311,1.4163,4.5964,1.1201,4.1376,2.6966,3.9179,0.5998,7.4502,3.2931,2.3293,1.7669,9.8538,9.7885,8.276,0.5651,9.3781,2.1601,7.7181,2.1947,2.9835,1.1651,2.6025,0.4956,1.7281,1.1863,1.7188,4.1577,4.8322,0.1801,0.9425,5.2907,2.1484,0.7793,0.8106,5.6012,1.8603,4.6844,2.011,4.7201,3.9464,3.4054,7.6098,4.2716,3.3609,2.0267,6.4687,0.9547,6.6923,0.4957,4.1747,1.8375,0.9063,6.6214,1.1918,1.5596,0.2942,2.6862,1.597]}
{"id":2582,"ended":true,"length":383,"text":"Pluteus aurantiorugosus is very similar to P. nevadensis in external appearance, and the two can only be reliably distinguished by microscopic characteristics or DNA sequence. In contrast to the latter species, the young of P. aurantiorugosus have a much larger round aperture.

It is hypothesized that P. aurantiorugosus has adapted to have a larger aperture to facilitate sperm transfer in the larger and more elaborate sexual dimorphism.","token_len":535,"entropy":[7.4062,9.2849,7.7035,1.7777,5.5646,10.8578,3.3795,1.0278,3.4033,5.679,2.5533,0.2174,4.8961,1.5434,7.9941,2.8482,4.3035,1.2946,2.6891,10.2128,1.7285,1.2426,1.9622,2.9391,3.1859,5.2991,5.0314,0.2856,9.8525,1.3475,0.7441,6.5062,6.2576,5.5759,6.9745,2.5064,1.031,3.0308,2.686,1.654,1.6639,3.9203,3.3633,0.1978,1.5616,8.0382,3.5125,0.7928,0.0033,1.1028,0.0028,0.0042,0.0169,0.0043,0.0015,1.9862,1.4603,4.0069,2.2728,7.4178,8.0893,2.7593,1.7069,4.7363,3.8641,1.5298,1.0263,0.0014,0.3249,0.0056,0.0027,0.006,0.0041,0.0011,0.5605,7.05,0.0039,2.9226,4.0629,0.4554,3.9196,0.8254,0.2573,4.0539,1.2257,0.0202,0.4874,0.0039,0.0037,0.0003,2.2466,7.52,2.679,3.1045,0.377,2.8428,1.7498,3.8386,0.598,1.7846,0.1236,2.3521,1.081,0.8091,0.0011,2.1282,0.0737,3.1287,5.4616,0.2844,3.5607,1.1611,1.5598,5.538,3.7339,0.1334,0.0021,4.4972,5.5077,0.1201,8.4874,0.4711,2.9347,4.2739,0.0382,0.8997,6.9692,2.3534,3.6046,5.5581,3.8659,0.3506,8.6728,1.0174,0.0022,4.4309,0.7507,2.5632,2.8144,0.0022,2.2511,0.0021,0.0011,0.0001,5.3499,3.4887,1.5389,8.1431,7.4778,1.5887,3.6796,0.4917,4.7985,0.6134,1.6675,3.0076,6.1726,1.1742,0.802,7.7981,0.5997,0.0043,1.047,2.0192,1.3461,0.0014,0.3894,0.0157,0.0026,0.0047,0.0022,0.001,1.4937,3.3462,1.2799,3.349,1.5523,0.0001,0.006,3.2233,0.5054,0.3424,0.0886,1.0207,1.4313,4.4826,4.9484,5.6638,2.2947,3.3631,4.7859,0.0128,0.0935,0.0166,0.0054,0.0059,0.0036,0.0044,6.3323,1.0074,4.6078,0.9561,2.5671,7.391,10.8197,6.9212,2.0052,5.089,6.3276,0.0146,3.4217,4.9722,2.2511,1.4072,4.2056,6.7812,0.0391,0.2863,1.5057,0.5558,0.0028,3.8625,0.0032,0.0012,0.0002,2.7986,2.9767,5.7633,4.7472,1.6576,3.3504,0.5308,5.901,0.062,2.5078,0.0008,0.0338,0.0169,0.0034,0.0033,0.0021,0.0012,2.311,6.4846,0.5,5.5929,1.0204,2.0692,0.5367,3.6438,3.5321,5.8876,3.5646,3.0938,1.6094,4.8742,4.2846,0.9137,6.692,4.8368,4.3613,0.0062,0.2571,1.8895,2.0271,0.0007,5.3839,4.7663,0.0004,3.8741,0.2497,0.0255,0.7763,0.0075,0.0133,0.0352,0.0094,0.0058,1.3297,5.0021,0.2006,0.2506,0.1891,0.0034,0.1637,0.0026,0.001,0.0001,0.1978,0.7974,0.0034,0.2374,0.0595,0.0113,0.0068,0.0038,0.0006,0.0007,0.0674,0.0064,0.0031,0.03,0.0118,0.0043,0.0002,0.0041,0.011,0.2662,0.004,0.0012,0.0057,0.0594,0.0011,0.0006,0.0019,0.0072,0.0004,0.0169,0.0005,0.0018,0.0212,0.0024,0.0014,0.0013,0.0012,0.0021,0.0035,0.0009,0.0202,0.0072,0.0013,0.0018,0.0199,0.0004,0.0006,0.0006,0.0014,0.0004,0.0012,0.0233,0.0019,0.0014,0.004,0.0013,0.001,0.0018,0.0005,0.0207,0.0068,0.0021,0.0006,0.0343,0.0049,0.0023,0.0008,0.0005,0.0011,0.0021,0.0007,0.0,0.0027,0.5037,0.0164,0.0059,0.001,0.0062,0.0013,0.0011,0.0008,0.0018,0.0007,0.0026,0.0012,0.0022,0.0003,0.0028,0.0004,0.0023,0.002,0.0014,0.0302,0.0094,0.0305,0.044,0.0013,0.0019,0.0003,0.0021,0.0018,0.0006,0.0028,0.0026,0.0861,0.1349,0.0144,0.0007,0.0006,0.0039,0.0016,0.0034,0.0102,0.0006,0.0879,0.0054,0.001,0.0001,0.0009,0.0155,0.0064,0.0006,0.0093,0.0032,0.0011,0.0,0.0003,0.0072,0.0011,0.0007,0.0033,0.0011,0.0001,0.001,0.0406,0.0027,0.0019,0.019,0.0003,0.0005,0.0019,0.0009,0.0,0.0009,0.0005,0.0369,0.0023,0.0007,0.0017,0.005,0.0025,0.0013,0.0006,0.0017,0.232,0.0122,0.0019,0.0032,0.0006,0.0002,0.0005,0.0055,0.0014,0.0001,0.0014,0.0118,0.0008,0.0456,0.005,0.0342,0.0037,0.0057,0.0241,0.0004,0.001,0.022,0.0123,0.0016,0.0034,0.0028,0.0001,0.0014,0.0034,0.0188,0.001,0.0058,0.0287,0.0013,0.0007,0.002,0.053,0.0006,0.0101,0.0003,0.0012,0.0018,0.0091,0.0048,0.0021,0.0007,0.0005,0.0024,0.0004,0.006,0.0031,0.0007,0.0,0.002,0.0019,0.0025,0.0011,0.0005,0.0447,0.0018,0.0064,0.0004,0.0058,0.0004,0.0009,0.0163,0.0082,0.0021,0.0033,0.0042,0.0048,0.0021,0.0009,0.0018,0.0061,0.0144,0.0001,0.0013,0.0014,0.0006,0.0008,0.0034,0.0019,0.0085,0.0006,0.0017,0.0013,0.0017,0.0,0.0001,0.0003,0.001]}

{"id":3686,"ended":true,"length":446,"text":"Manuel Alberti was born in Buenos Aires on 28 May 1763 to Antonio Alberti and Juana Agustina Mar\u00edn. He was baptized on the following 1 June at the Concepci\u00f3n parish ; his godparents were Vicente Pareja, Mar\u00eda Antonieta Carrizo, and Crist\u00f3bal Puelles, all of whom would be influential civic figures in Buenos Aires, and would form an axis of the city's political elite. Manuel Alberti attended the San Mart\u00edn School and the Colegio de San Carlos, where he received a private tutorship and tutored his younger brother and three of his female and five male cousins. He was one of the early pioneers of Argentine law.\n\nManuel Alberti had strong personal ties to the royal family; in fact, his grandfather Vicente Pareja was not only a founding member of the Casa Rosada, but a personal friend of Fernando VII. Pareja remained close to the royal family, and even in his final years was the personal secretary to the monarch. Manuel Alberti served as a close friend to Carlos III. The Prince Regent was so fond of Alberti that he would call him \u201cUn pobre\u201d (a poor boy). During his long political career, Alberti was a key confidant of both the First and Second Regencies, while he remained as well close to the royal family.\n\nDuring the 1790s, Manuel Alberti developed close relations with various influential members of the European diplomatic community in Buenos Aires, including the Viceroy's Ambassador Antonio Rivas of the Kingdom of Naples. Later, Rivas recommended him to the newly elected royal government, who appointed him as the Minister of the Chamber of Commerce in 1798.\nAt the time of the coup by the forces led by Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen in 1810, Manuel Alberti was a close associate of the Vice-Minister of Internal Affairs, Fernando de los R\u00edos. Alberti, who was of Roman Catholic faith, remained loyal to the royalist cause, even when his cousin, Pedro Carlos, Count of Barrientos, was forced to abdicate after the fall of Buenos Aires to Napoleon Bonaparte's forces at the end of the year. He took part in the defence of the city in 1811, and later wrote to Luis Cipriani Vazquez on behalf of Carlos III with an appeal to be allowed safe passage to a place of exile outside the Empire's territories. Alberti was not permitted passage out of the country, and died in a French prison in 1814.","token_len":537,"entropy":[9.1439,8.9663,3.5351,3.5323,2.8148,0.5444,4.6761,0.0047,2.0437,4.4593,2.4118,4.2498,4.5259,3.1715,5.2322,1.5899,0.0377,1.0335,5.9936,2.521,5.9417,2.6424,3.4305,7.1446,3.3832,1.4311,1.2582,1.2915,5.2831,1.1745,2.9801,5.7616,7.245,3.2037,4.4776,1.0192,11.4244,0.3435,0.0047,0.0006,7.0538,10.6797,2.2577,8.4179,2.3183,0.7636,6.9202,0.2158,5.0604,3.8882,1.495,1.8362,5.3101,0.3347,6.3741,4.7846,1.7054,5.3991,3.4906,3.6417,1.0883,0.7009,5.9941,4.098,0.0081,3.8223,7.0527,1.5557,3.4383,2.4872,3.5169,0.3547,0.2143,6.255,2.7973,7.6334,10.4049,1.2021,1.2516,2.0754,0.0002,2.3646,1.0863,4.6869,4.6204,3.2225,8.0682,0.8238,3.0244,3.127,0.9019,1.5381,4.7446,0.4481,7.1875,1.1076,0.0019,4.3189,0.8756,5.27,4.0629,0.2552,3.0537,2.3895,2.0129,7.9228,2.8938,0.1175,1.2262,3.3481,4.4635,1.2368,2.2801,0.1441,2.3337,1.8253,7.2245,5.5374,3.3998,2.5534,4.9551,3.1333,2.1896,3.3907,0.4914,3.6038,5.1876,3.0684,0.0556,7.7504,7.2059,4.3166,2.5339,4.5086,0.5015,1.7729,1.6355,4.1391,0.0106,0.5891,4.7393,3.0539,0.2911,4.1492,5.6349,1.9747,1.702,0.0214,6.1006,0.0014,0.0787,0.0025,3.8602,5.8094,4.057,1.9992,0.4355,0.9971,6.7451,0.2341,4.0559,2.9124,2.1152,0.2864,1.6822,3.3852,7.7002,0.0173,1.0172,0.1439,0.023,1.1561,6.47,1.7109,1.0291,5.5738,0.4702,0.0396,0.2473,8.0772,0.145,5.8725,2.6021,1.4252,0.8115,2.4264,5.422,0.2583,0.5318,6.45,8.9203,2.5342,3.6595,0.1069,0.0078,6.1336,1.6653,0.2428,1.0383,1.3563,0.0774,2.2595,1.4671,3.5981,4.2944,1.573,4.9643,0.2548,3.3503,3.2749,5.3272,2.0059,0.6799,0.8188,4.3632,0.7377,3.5361,0.0312,0.0026,4.2673,0.6234,1.4454,5.235,1.1695,1.957,4.3237,1.9275,2.5291,3.247,5.5873,5.5502,0.576,2.2751,5.5993,3.5186,0.0276,2.7142,0.035,0.2619,0.6379,3.7682,4.5776,0.1123,13.3796,7.396,8.1573,6.2659,5.434,2.2558,3.5302,7.9851,3.1546,3.8361,7.0216,3.803,2.2191,4.6206,1.0721,4.706,4.1578,0.1546,0.329,0.8337,0.0082,1.6296,2.1028,4.5455,6.7664,0.6288,0.5245,3.4917,1.0633,6.8146,1.0484,0.0889,3.8165,5.001,1.2342,5.0264,2.8251,3.9479,4.5579,4.9435,4.0979,0.0967,0.5772,2.8053,0.2095,0.9588,0.9783,0.0002,3.4254,0.9633,5.2324,2.3556,0.0703,0.4391,2.2181,0.0241,0.0029,5.2443,2.6729,1.7841,0.0127,5.4375,4.6246,2.522,0.0193,0.2226,8.1833,7.6826,2.0763,3.196,0.7128,0.0001,1.2314,1.311,1.7452,7.2569,0.9171,0.026,4.7494,4.7542,5.0851,7.0779,0.6152,4.8185,1.5016,5.0293,0.0663,4.7924,1.4983,5.5225,0.7839,7.0699,0.0008,7.0081,3.7728,0.4846,1.1092,6.1601,1.2297,7.0834,4.162,1.6593,2.2792,3.0586,0.8602,1.1925,1.88,2.4031,0.254,2.3387,7.9794,0.1811,1.7382,2.7443,3.3254,3.1915,0.2853,2.0468,19.2995,0.4442,1.9916,0.9043,1.8675,3.7629,6.3809,1.0584,5.9644,4.522,0.0136,14.0749,4.9876,3.3848,4.2589,6.852,9.402,6.0846,4.2861,2.8409,2.9009,4.139,0.0628,1.4983,0.0271,0.0025,0.866,2.4322,2.9676,2.1038,0.1018,1.0715,6.051,0.5102,2.8124,0.0052,0.3502,5.6668,0.0892,1.0872,4.967,3.5378,4.0817,3.9738,1.5647,0.0729,1.566,3.983,0.0032,2.9901,1.355,1.2343,5.0541,6.5553,0.6337,2.9813,0.2392,4.8404,3.1444,0.0987,0.8128,4.8602,4.8982,3.4046,1.7059,2.8472,2.5063,2.1578,6.2234,1.9425,4.759,5.3239,1.4848,11.9147,0.4529,5.9914,5.3971,0.2754,0.3406,1.2088,4.4586,0.3537,6.3736,0.0636,0.004,3.1459,1.2315,3.9812,0.0118,6.0701,0.0043,3.5439,6.914,2.1021,0.0008,0.0004,3.9788,1.4531,4.3013,0.9492,0.8145,0.0007,0.9493,3.3314,0.7008,3.627,5.276,2.0693,0.0237,0.6602,6.7731,0.0593,0.8516,3.6456,2.9799,1.6244,2.5268,0.8977,1.506,3.2535,5.4371,2.5439,6.1613,5.0005,4.1465,1.3318,0.0385,7.2299,3.3463,0.1368,3.7921,1.9361,0.0011,5.3556,0.378,5.3817,2.9945,2.1206,1.1255,4.9622,2.815,8.1135,0.0801,0.7337,5.1141,4.117,0.5917,4.3261,7.472,1.1502,5.2134,5.2885,3.6729,0.308,2.1374,0.0034,1.6179,4.1745,4.1817,5.0741,4.223,0.1269,0.6153,2.3765,1.3722,1.309,4.3395,0.7921,3.4079,5.8782,0.8154,0.9358,1.5714,2.1671,0.3162]}

One type of star that can survive these huge explosions are very massive. Once a star reaches its last bit of energy, it explodes as a supernova, and its gravity blows off its outer layers, sending a shock wave outwards. This shock wave, which is similar to an air shock wave and is powerful enough to stretch our atmosphere, will continue to compress all of the gas inside the star for an unknown amount of time before the star dies.In the case of Eta Carinae, some astronomers think that the shock wave from the star destroyed nearly all of the water on the planet. But this is only one hypothesis, and astronomers will have to wait until they can directly see their star explode before knowing how it affected Eta Carinae.One of the more recent predictions of what astronomers can expect to see is similar to what we see in the Large Magellanic Cloud, where astronomers have found many similar stars. According to that hypothesis, the light we see coming from the supernova remnant Eta Carinae has been traveling for 14 billions years and therefore was made up of much more light than what we see today. The gas in this supernova remnant has travelled for that long from the star.Astronomers are hoping to find a white massive star that exploded around the same time of Eta Carinae, which is now 14 billion light-years away. They will likely use the Hubble Space Telescope to look for it. The telescope will focus in the same direction which the star initially exploded. It will have enough power to see far enough back through the dust, so that we would even be able to see Eta Carinae before it actually exploded.So far it seems as though such an object has not been discovered, and although that could mean that they simply don't know what they're looking for, or that Eta Carinae in a smaller remnant which will eventually be destroyed or absorbed by the clouds that surround it.","token_len":538,"entropy":[2.8006,0.4101,1.9747,8.2138,8.707,5.1108,2.6792,5.2167,3.5305,6.3663,1.0414,2.5103,0.5521,1.5741,4.6687,4.1173,5.5106,8.446,2.1934,2.9708,3.3198,1.2901,0.3413,0.9248,0.9428,0.4818,0.2151,4.1865,3.3855,1.2991,6.3199,0.2302,3.3989,5.4255,1.88,0.017,0.3374,1.0029,0.0004,1.9781,8.263,1.502,3.3303,2.9066,0.4171,3.5078,4.0231,3.4703,2.1831,3.7033,3.7505,0.4883,3.4829,2.8217,1.6167,3.3016,2.6358,1.0462,6.2311,2.6368,0.871,2.1279,1.9149,4.9104,0.5843,0.8641,1.0277,0.0002,5.3383,0.6682,3.0294,2.0418,0.0091,3.1272,1.8032,4.4383,1.8422,3.1397,3.154,3.0112,3.6278,1.9627,4.5198,1.6443,8.254,1.8909,5.453,0.0304,1.0554,2.552,5.8986,4.9234,4.6868,0.6938,5.0209,5.1575,1.0445,1.5869,1.7127,8.359,1.5705,0.6456,0.0003,4.3327,2.4542,4.7663,0.9103,5.1525,0.0252,1.0723,1.0341,1.8142,1.7816,3.7747,4.6905,6.4193,0.0268,2.2445,1.8194,2.8543,5.8341,9.0922,3.6976,2.9448,1.3833,1.6023,1.9702,1.4977,4.4094,0.2644,0.2261,2.9693,3.9471,0.1862,2.9626,1.2823,1.7046,2.4554,4.3739,0.2642,0.2504,0.4472,6.4879,2.8039,0.7681,1.1336,2.6985,1.0661,0.2407,3.8221,6.0251,0.3622,5.0989,4.6574,3.0024,3.9599,7.4516,2.3216,0.9442,2.7193,2.2678,6.6289,8.4162,0.1421,2.2203,0.4562,0.5416,2.4837,4.5742,0.8754,1.5166,0.0168,1.3437,2.2366,3.7321,5.1372,7.624,3.8223,2.44,3.0318,1.2165,1.4488,4.7056,2.5842,3.4846,0.3396,4.0383,0.9767,1.2359,2.5882,1.9496,0.1558,3.1325,2.0842,1.2276,3.8277,0.1726,3.0758,5.0442,5.3232,1.4569,4.7448,1.6248,5.5989,0.0577,0.0564,7.7342,5.0675,4.6134,0.8719,3.4572,4.6515,0.6213,5.4149,4.1792,0.7904,0.7906,3.5859,2.8222,0.8236,0.9452,1.9653,4.5309,4.0914,0.5404,0.0017,0.0246,2.7746,3.4742,1.4553,3.0732,0.5912,11.6386,1.8421,1.9298,0.0151,2.24,0.002,0.0686,0.0003,0.0017,0.1236,6.1768,4.7024,2.6449,1.1194,1.2597,1.0419,0.0895,5.9105,0.8551,3.5125,6.6475,5.8658,0.3769,0.4451,0.7662,5.394,1.3429,0.8252,0.909,1.2932,3.3151,2.0462,1.0602,2.9505,2.0736,5.9151,1.2255,0.8131,4.7311,4.3905,1.2963,0.0462,0.9636,1.2227,3.1819,2.1924,6.3395,1.9942,6.6176,0.7347,4.3462,2.0317,6.034,2.5246,1.9533,5.3625,3.2777,0.0003,0.0418,0.0005,0.0012,0.4485,5.9295,1.177,0.0436,4.0149,3.0114,3.6603,1.6684,3.7628,5.8843,4.5773,2.1002,2.2704,0.7396,2.4073,7.892,0.0741,1.6973,1.1135,2.0812,1.4255,0.9707,5.8963,0.4753,0.0003,0.0,0.0645,1.1457,1.807,4.4596,1.3543,2.6117,4.1855,4.8582,3.3139,1.5302,5.9752,0.0008,5.4871,3.6472,0.0418,1.6167,5.3361,5.0038,0.5113,3.3558,0.3194,1.5635,3.29,0.1067,0.345,8.5617,0.0015,0.0282,0.0006,0.0028,4.7086,1.899,5.0344,4.3616,6.9223,8.4475,1.5318,3.649,5.8287,3.7788,4.8988,2.2325,0.1041,4.3759,1.6134,1.5566,0.2264,2.5769,0.7651,1.006,2.0035,0.2396,2.8039,6.5341,2.2529,2.9437,3.2958,0.0054,0.183,2.4356,6.259,1.6323,6.1805,1.2781,6.3521,1.0672,1.2808,2.9069,5.4151,0.0552,0.0165,2.3892,4.4575,1.1112,1.4169,1.9911,5.4105,7.4602,0.1735,1.6414,5.2904,4.6553,1.7365,2.1247,0.1446,5.4139,1.7775,0.0031,0.0045,0.0008,0.0027,1.2636,1.8052,1.3225,4.0521,6.1521,0.4839,5.3669,2.1408,0.0048,0.2061,0.4848,4.2761,2.9173,4.1413,3.9688,1.6769,4.5703,0.0726,0.0022,0.5657,1.5667,0.5137,3.8737,0.983,2.8405,4.2052,1.0118,5.2737,3.8227,2.1829,3.2395,0.9257,6.2741,1.4434,2.7108,8.2116,1.7851,1.4897,3.0491,0.4351,3.8305,4.5126,2.7841,0.1175,3.2388,6.2224,1.1016,3.6307,6.1908,0.422,5.7868,3.8814,1.8431,1.5778,2.3981,3.1776,6.9647,0.783,0.1275,0.005,0.5785,3.1398,0.0019,0.0021,0.0009,0.0013,3.9774,0.5883,4.3966,0.9593,0.1765,5.374,0.7425,4.5804,2.0725,2.6371,0.493,6.7523,2.12,2.6857,2.3676,2.001,0.8317,1.8571,1.9947,1.6655,5.0177,4.9738,2.7923,2.2596,0.8195,4.145,5.6239,2.7949,0.0003,3.1217,1.2964,1.2725,1.5949,0.4247,0.4196,0.4113,4.6676,0.9015,6.328,0.0032,0.003,0.0006,0.0013,6.3563,4.883,6.5221,6.9417,8.3957,4.5229,3.6142,1.6218,2.9808,4.1325,6.5811,0.3998,0.841,6.6297,4.1947,1.0023,0.4713,2.4739]}

Stone rows represent a very small proportion of the number and variety of Pictish sites identified in Scotland, particularly in the Caithness and Sutherland regions where no significant sites have been identified.","token_len":540,"entropy":[9.3399,13.2413,7.3132,7.6835,9.3551,3.3914,3.5153,0.6525,7.864,3.6869,8.8074,0.5855,6.1473,7.437,3.1042,6.4907,2.0055,1.3965,0.8016,3.6269,7.8159,0.1575,4.1602,2.0717,0.7258,4.9527,6.7816,0.0962,0.8095,5.5018,0.0991,4.2248,1.6833,4.0649,1.5955,4.8952,1.4278,1.2926,0.1204,0.1562,0.4014,4.6693,0.011,7.2811,0.4255,8.8968,0.4659,4.6292,2.4177,3.5406,3.3185,3.6898,0.6756,6.1098,4.2794,8.4182,4.9756,0.0008,1.1295,6.6214,1.3251,0.0949,1.134,5.3924,6.3526,3.4113,0.021,3.1591,2.2788,7.7202,3.8772,4.3602,0.7995,0.6504,0.9457,8.3818,2.7484,5.696,0.3805,1.892,0.1175,7.7817,0.8135,6.7664,10.9387,4.0854,1.6131,8.3036,0.8807,4.7616,0.3137,1.7711,0.0527,0.1005,0.4455,1.5347,0.0047,1.6332,0.6076,7.004,4.1991,2.773,1.6832,5.9059,6.076,3.2598,0.6941,4.8022,5.5106,0.0967,7.1123,1.2209,3.4414,2.1313,6.0892,3.8461,2.7717,2.457,5.8189,5.2155,5.3503,5.4982,0.0007,1.5422,2.472,1.1182,0.0256,1.8188,0.2628,3.5314,0.6006,5.5855,2.649,0.8029,1.4732,0.0113,6.3929,0.0582,1.7697,1.1442,5.9747,3.7249,2.7119,0.0052,4.7436,0.9746,5.7322,1.2186,5.4606,4.4378,3.8988,5.6442,3.9359,3.3185,7.5168,0.0202,1.8416,2.0591,1.0362,5.2724,0.4329,0.2684,2.3909,5.0912,1.9694,7.4596,0.0215,0.0824,3.6985,3.1897,3.0835,6.4423,1.4585,2.8401,2.8164,0.9047,6.082,5.7306,7.5053,6.6345,1.0616,1.9292,5.7863,2.5461,2.1819,0.0276,4.9407,1.7422,4.2996,0.3276,1.2942,8.0927,4.8742,5.2527,5.3396,1.6751,1.9475,4.0934,0.0063,0.0166,1.4779,3.1766,5.6824,1.8023,5.2223,1.3247,0.1718,1.2492,1.1335,4.5627,5.8074,2.1202,4.5144,0.4287,0.0459,3.8437,1.6694,0.7338,5.4253,4.8209,0.0497,2.5694,5.6817,1.8085,7.1408,0.1552,1.5343,4.7498,0.5923,1.1719,0.3726,5.452,1.8594,4.9151,1.9683,4.1466,2.3132,1.3205,0.0237,0.5608,4.1456,5.905,3.6317,0.1254,3.7492,0.0109,3.793,5.6049,1.5701,0.976,1.2567,5.0997,1.0802,0.6431,2.901,0.0126,0.0081,2.1638,4.7256,2.3332,4.2272,6.1161,4.5519,3.8639,0.9031,0.1545,0.741,0.4128,0.9467,0.0002,5.5122,2.8369,0.2328,0.0029,0.1404,0.3536,0.1337,0.0885,0.0033,0.0019,0.0757,0.0189,0.0015,0.0582,0.0161,0.0139,0.0378,0.03,0.0119,0.0027,0.8052,0.0013,0.0005,0.0001,0.0054,0.0013,0.0016,0.0072,0.0003,0.0024,0.0598,0.002,0.006,0.0047,0.0016,0.0025,0.0069,0.0013,0.0086,0.0027,0.0045,0.0019,0.0021,0.0011,0.0177,0.0023,0.0082,0.001,0.0005,0.0021,0.007,0.0016,0.0035,0.0018,0.0017,0.0034,0.0042,0.0049,0.001,0.0019,0.0033,0.0001,0.0007,0.0008,0.0012,0.0007,0.0055,0.0003,0.005,0.0018,0.0023,0.0004,0.0085,0.0006,0.0005,0.0029,0.0048,0.0018,0.0004,0.0003,0.0017,0.0013,0.0012,0.0007,0.0045,0.0165,0.0008,0.0007,0.0017,0.0018,0.0026,0.0005,0.009,0.0051,0.0036,0.0018,0.0009,0.001,0.0001,0.0027,0.1013,0.0008,0.0022,0.0038,0.0316,0.0034,0.0055,0.0006,0.0043,0.0005,0.0007,0.0079,0.0011,0.0061,0.0089,0.005,0.0002,0.0006,0.0022,0.009,0.0006,0.0048,0.0098,0.0005,0.0008,0.004,0.0006,0.0002,0.0044,0.0018,0.001,0.0007,0.0009,0.0017,0.0009,0.4334,0.0001,1.3792,0.0005,0.0484,0.0079,0.0039,0.0024,0.0014,0.0008,0.0062,0.0029,0.0014,0.0005,0.0003,0.0018,0.0101,0.0112,0.0015,0.0041,0.0014,0.0017,0.0019,0.0016,0.0011,0.0349,0.0367,0.0001,0.0012,0.0051,0.0014,0.0003,0.0007,0.0009,0.002,0.002,0.0012,0.0033,0.0009,0.0026,0.002,0.0004,0.0054,0.0137,0.0194,0.0015,0.0008,0.0421,0.0008,0.0005,0.0002,0.0003,0.0001,0.0027,0.0065,0.0003,0.0012,0.0118,0.0032,0.0005,0.0059,0.0021,0.0019,0.0022,0.0002,0.0043,0.0009,0.0014,0.0011,0.0086,0.0007,0.0017,0.0095,0.0007,0.0009,0.0011,0.0008,0.0007,0.0016,0.0006,0.0003,0.0001,0.007,0.0023,0.0011,0.0006,0.0008,0.0009,0.0013,0.0119,0.0048,0.0008,0.0008,0.0019,0.0008,0.0022,0.0114,0.0044,0.0018,0.0005,0.0009,0.001,0.0073,0.0004,0.001,0.0008,0.0026,0.0007,0.006,0.0008,0.0007,0.0001,0.0012,0.0008,0.0013,0.001,0.004,0.0823,0.0037,0.0007,0.0053,0.0019,0.0006,0.0011,0.0,0.0042,0.0004,0.0005,0.0033,0.001,0.0013,0.001,0.0002,0.0007]}
{"id":4265,"ended":true,"length":484,"text":"The long @ - @ term use of supplemental vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D or vitamin E does not reduce the risk of lung cancer. Some studies suggest that people who take supplements of any of these vitamins are more likely to develop a kind of cancer called interstitial lung cancer, but it is not clear whether this applies only to people with smoking habits.\n\nA meta-analysis (a study of studies) found no evidence that antioxidant supplements might reduce the risk of lung cancer.\n\nPyridoxine, vitamin C, vitamin E and ascorbic acid are believed by some health practitioners to have beneficial effects for lung health and lung cancer.\n\nSome antioxidants increase levels of the antioxidant glutathione in your body, which has been linked to a longer life.\n\nAntioxidant supplements are not harmful in people without a certain disease \u2014 known as the disease condition criteria (DCC).\n\nAccording to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the National Cancer Institute, antioxidants do not affect blood sugar, cholesterol, blood pressure or other common health problems.\n\n\"What the meta-analysis clearly confirms, or at least provides good evidence, that there is no significant benefit,\" said Dr. Hui-Gang Lai, a professor of public health at the City University of Hong Kong who was not involved in the study.\n\nAntioxidant supplements are popular for reducing the chance of heart disease and stroke \u2014 as well as slowing the loss of muscle tissue known as sarcopenia, which occurs in many older adults. But there is evidence those benefits are not connected to the use of the supplements, Lai said.\n\nLai said research suggests that vitamins can sometimes act as drug metabolites and alter the way the body works. They can influence metabolism by interfering with other drugs and by blocking some of the body\u2019s natural defenses, Lai said.\n\nThe study included results from eight studies that examined whether antioxidants reduced lung cancer incidence among people without the disease condition DCC. No significant reductions were seen.\n\n\"Most of my patients ask me whether taking vitamin supplements causes cancer,\" said Dr. Joseph Ross, chief medical officer for the American Lung Association.\n\nThe answer, he said, is no. However, he added, \"People often don\u2019t know the amount of vitamins and supplements they take. Many people with lung cancer were taking vitamins without knowing it.\"\n\nRoss said the study's results are an important reminder not to take too many vitamins or supplements.\n\nThe researchers said more research is necessary to see if antioxidants might help people with DCC or if taking them might extend their survival time.","token_len":544,"entropy":[6.82,12.7144,8.0879,3.9349,6.2777,7.7072,1.2577,13.0995,9.0165,2.1586,3.1294,2.5188,1.795,0.4488,1.7298,1.3031,3.3515,1.4481,0.3484,5.3766,0.0868,4.5303,1.2718,0.3736,0.1378,5.1275,0.1487,1.2509,6.1672,1.4538,1.5716,0.5871,4.6567,1.076,2.0669,3.3218,4.2428,3.7906,3.7812,0.177,1.6007,2.6402,1.8218,0.2581,0.0437,0.7377,3.5971,7.5127,0.0077,2.6202,1.9082,6.3904,0.2466,2.2834,0.5721,1.6995,3.6437,3.006,0.6089,0.8888,1.2622,0.9823,1.085,6.5104,4.8838,0.0507,1.2032,1.8055,5.8019,3.3738,0.8537,1.3299,0.0018,3.9596,5.2449,0.0325,0.0134,4.3554,4.482,3.6284,0.894,6.0502,2.8502,2.383,2.1739,2.0074,0.7247,6.6316,0.712,4.9449,1.3569,0.896,0.0995,0.0341,1.4369,0.0145,0.6515,1.3736,0.0002,5.225,6.7279,1.4493,0.0787,0.1498,1.6399,4.4886,1.3929,0.8905,0.4863,0.2658,0.797,7.6247,0.6173,0.0192,0.1168,0.0024,1.3833,5.9383,5.5677,0.5638,5.9431,3.8153,0.0263,2.3804,4.3935,0.3861,4.0217,2.943,3.0804,2.6532,4.4032,0.4408,1.6935,0.8179,0.0002,4.1075,5.5755,5.963,4.6311,0.0289,2.6035,1.1618,3.3993,0.0096,0.0,2.2619,3.0393,1.5202,1.1108,1.0242,4.2508,0.3551,1.0398,0.1372,2.709,6.1249,0.7414,2.3454,0.6915,0.0002,4.1654,0.0017,1.3177,1.2447,1.786,2.7613,4.2979,2.8511,2.5449,4.7088,1.963,4.8342,5.2502,6.2281,7.9317,0.0371,4.2473,5.4267,9.0477,10.68,2.7699,1.2148,6.5189,0.8049,0.6252,0.0002,6.2644,0.003,0.6545,3.4112,0.0354,0.0892,0.0072,2.1136,0.0076,0.002,0.0083,5.6671,0.7106,1.8192,0.7507,0.0012,0.3226,2.8618,3.379,0.1842,3.4469,2.9294,2.2099,1.2431,1.5632,1.2515,1.9769,0.2727,0.6721,2.4389,5.5437,2.3617,1.6302,0.5225,0.4674,0.0002,3.9701,4.5494,3.9288,6.9652,0.0079,0.0361,4.9819,6.2122,3.3851,5.7536,3.0238,0.1223,3.9595,5.1761,0.2669,2.0323,4.9334,4.0068,0.5368,1.3926,3.3657,2.6603,4.6527,0.7081,1.3826,0.2486,5.8846,4.9967,1.9791,4.4111,2.2583,5.5365,1.326,0.1844,1.3365,1.0391,0.3554,3.977,0.0472,0.4984,0.7774,6.3259,0.0485,0.0314,4.5738,0.0007,2.3777,1.7186,0.0436,0.0211,0.0675,0.0811,0.5651,0.1173,0.4446,0.0002,5.4279,0.0015,0.9385,0.4878,1.2956,5.6879,3.3431,4.7958,1.1728,5.8399,0.063,2.2763,0.347,1.2437,2.2465,4.1298,4.5954,0.0482,0.003,7.2229,0.6661,6.8338,0.0211,2.6943,3.0683,7.6286,0.0442,3.0377,0.0508,0.0046,1.5924,1.2488,2.4496,1.8305,3.6104,3.5423,1.5034,0.376,4.0487,3.0909,0.7724,2.931,7.3792,1.9167,1.1012,1.2278,9.1489,0.2839,1.4306,3.493,0.0199,3.4819,0.6758,1.8633,2.9288,0.0004,0.13,0.0715,0.122,0.0002,3.9363,0.1474,0.9435,5.056,2.5005,1.1447,5.1244,3.6919,5.926,4.8382,0.3129,7.8093,8.3326,2.8804,5.366,0.6283,1.7765,1.637,0.2505,3.0214,0.8587,5.1444,1.4855,5.8797,3.6754,3.9363,2.5795,0.0081,4.3785,4.0322,2.1888,2.5056,2.8753,3.6245,1.2365,0.1431,1.7401,22.5045,8.0557,3.6415,1.7938,2.6768,1.5668,3.8048,0.0006,0.0503,0.0352,0.1598,0.0002,2.5597,2.3449,4.5456,7.7322,0.2553,4.8414,1.6199,2.2941,2.5012,3.8222,1.6967,3.1078,3.0617,0.0366,3.8807,3.5713,1.3612,3.6712,3.9379,1.0229,3.8331,3.3261,0.0091,0.59,5.8421,3.6533,5.0389,0.4745,1.1679,2.8456,0.2703,0.0003,2.4502,5.3048,0.9835,5.8698,1.0791,8.5601,0.7271,3.8983,6.0862,2.4823,3.1466,4.5958,2.0886,1.5162,0.8612,1.2954,0.0024,5.3208,7.6752,0.3652,3.1674,2.2534,0.0286,2.471,0.7816,2.4271,1.1326,0.0624,0.6688,1.4507,0.0002,2.1724,7.9589,1.8825,0.3972,0.1297,0.0077,0.1888,1.111,0.3658,5.8989,0.0224,2.0457,1.7865,0.4153,0.9846,4.4536,4.1826,3.8009,10.7575,1.6726,0.1122,1.3126,3.0101,5.2493,0.2887,2.9866,2.1205,2.8652,0.7908,2.6996,2.1074,4.8447,1.0725,3.8963,3.5307,0.1417,6.2987,2.5988,4.188,3.9303,1.2272,3.4385,1.1679,0.0468,0.0002,3.208,0.6122,1.8348,1.9534,3.444,1.5678,1.7245,5.5772,1.027,1.9427,5.0777,0.4623,1.2519,3.0774,0.7241,1.6845,2.1242,0.457,1.3039,0.537,0.0002,3.2686,3.5631,2.6046,5.4649,0.4576,0.2472,4.131,0.4216,4.1436,0.7756,1.8956,3.1821,2.3623,2.3076,0.7674,1.456,0.0015,2.6541,4.0307,5.9431,1.5814,2.3287,7.9019,0.7507,5.9749,2.3637,0.4032]}
{"id":4555,"ended":true,"length":335,"text":"Since World War II, Japan's flag has been criticized for its association with the country's militaristic past. Similar objections have also been raised to the current national anthem of Japan, which contains a verse written by an individual deeply associated with the militaristic period -- \"We, the people of Japan, will always be a people that fights for the country's safety.\"\n\nA revision of the current national anthem song is now underway with the hope of removing the controversial verses from the anthem. But changing a national anthem is no easy task in Japan, partly because changing a national symbol like the flag could also anger the nation's traditionalists.\n\n(In order to avoid confusion about the meanings of the kanji \u793e\u6587(futatsu), and \u95a2\u9023 (shiki), Japanese people often translate the word \u515a (yakyuu) into English as either \"party\" or \"coalition.\" However, the use of \u8b70\u5e2d (yaky\u016b) in the English translations below is meant to include all parties -- including those that do not fit into the \"coalition\" or \"party\" categories, or that were only included for the sake of comprehensibility in the English translations.)\n\nParty :\n\n\u9023\u90a6\u515a (yaky\u016b k\u014dgy\u016b)\n\nCoalition

{"id":823,"ended":true,"length":529,"text":"Gordon was again arrested on 13 January 2004. Police said at the time that the murder file had never been closed, and that the arrest followed new leads. These new leads were considered highly significant by the detectives, who have spent months reviewing them and preparing evidence.\n\nIn a statement issued through his solicitor, a spokesman for Gordon said he had always been completely open and cooperative with the police. He did not expect any new evidence to be discovered, the spokesman added.\n\nThe case against Gordon was put on hold until January 2004, when the police arrested him for assault and rape on two young women. In one case, one of the women said Mr Gordon had threatened her with a knife if she had not carried out the assault. The second alleged rape victim was a friend of the woman who had been assaulted.\n\nSince then, his mother and sister have repeatedly said that Mr Gordon is innocent. \"He was the picture of innocence, a happy-go-lucky person, and had never in his whole life caused anybody any grief,\" his sister Joan Gordon told the Daily Mail. \"I just want to know where this all started from. I know that they have no evidence, but I would like some closure. At least if the police were going to reopen this, they could do it properly. They have no case against him.\"\n\nThe last public statement on the case was made six months before Mr Gordon's arrest in 2003. During that time, there have been claims that Mr Gordon was a member of a paedophile gang operating in the north of England. But the police have vigorously denied these claims, insisting that at no stage during the investigation were the identities of the suspects ever revealed. The Metropolitan police said that it was the duty of the police to continue to investigate any new evidence.\n\nIt is currently being claimed that many of the suspects to whom the identities of the paedophile gang were revealed had been involved in child abuse, and were themselves the subjects of multiple investigations of similar abuse. Mr Gordon's arrest in 2004 will have come as a matter of considerable relief to his family and friends, particularly since he is now almost certain that no further evidence will be produced to convict him.\n\nA similar situation exists in the Michael Stone case, where the identity of the paedophile ring is thought to lie in the convictions of four men for child abuse. A spokesperson for the Crown Prosecution Service said that at this stage they can \" neither confirm nor deny \" any involvement of the Stone or Gordon suspects. However, any charges that are issued against Mr Gordon would have to be supported by strong evidence, since he was already sentenced to life imprisonment for the murders of the three young men who attacked him.","token_len":548,"entropy":[4.7983,7.5165,4.3911,2.0027,7.6953,3.2393,4.6795,1.6549,4.6575,1.7904,5.0605,0.5704,0.0276,0.917,2.4027,6.3049,10.8269,1.4246,5.2606,0.1273,3.1393,2.3049,1.0996,1.0445,1.9406,4.9269,7.0103,7.2551,4.1434,0.818,7.1623,1.3088,0.1089,2.2508,6.7302,4.8471,2.9453,1.5603,1.2655,4.7756,1.6799,0.9932,5.8506,4.917,2.5234,4.2718,5.2035,2.0298,4.9141,4.8992,0.8754,1.1822,0.0033,2.4843,3.1738,1.7165,2.8093,5.5854,2.5152,3.9889,0.4618,5.4255,2.4172,0.2229,6.0868,0.8126,3.2415,1.2558,4.7568,1.7687,5.6731,3.2912,2.5011,4.1284,0.7279,0.8132,0.9469,1.1143,1.6829,3.7639,0.1849,6.0932,2.2702,3.7336,2.9869,0.6606,0.9836,3.1844,1.8645,4.2016,0.1709,1.8041,0.1995,0.4505,0.0003,1.9552,3.4855,3.3892,1.3461,1.6299,4.5504,1.041,0.2545,2.2059,4.1101,3.0458,0.9687,0.383,1.7205,2.2936,4.3591,0.8055,2.3737,5.2867,1.7258,5.0262,2.2228,4.4417,5.109,1.1401,1.0599,3.2819,4.67,1.2668,0.1906,5.2751,0.3773,0.1585,0.8976,2.436,6.4934,0.3954,1.3459,2.6685,0.616,1.0432,0.455,0.3766,3.2562,0.0558,4.839,0.5032,6.1899,0.5919,0.6377,2.2418,0.4699,1.9798,3.2861,4.3619,3.0383,2.5013,2.2409,3.0899,4.6128,0.1316,1.1827,2.3462,1.7196,1.2107,1.0685,3.6744,0.6718,0.7083,0.0003,5.5119,0.8868,0.2728,4.8964,4.9609,2.2583,2.2538,0.3063,4.6251,2.6182,1.0805,2.8198,0.0059,3.3421,2.0268,0.9182,4.0106,1.4572,2.0919,3.4843,9.8611,0.1164,1.2344,2.3401,3.1372,4.5443,3.7752,0.0094,0.0035,0.0,0.0,3.2853,2.4334,2.5392,5.0271,2.9696,6.0088,0.617,3.121,0.0703,5.6491,4.2701,1.2461,5.1563,0.4762,2.4958,2.3009,7.3176,2.4603,1.2976,0.5986,2.4457,0.9955,0.523,1.5281,2.7227,4.1416,1.8515,1.0074,2.7853,3.4867,3.1912,3.2782,2.0957,4.754,1.3081,1.3319,2.6638,2.1416,5.5654,2.8682,3.016,3.381,2.3288,2.0413,0.9364,3.9659,0.9974,5.5938,3.5356,1.9761,5.682,2.2466,4.2467,2.9568,1.0911,3.7131,3.2961,0.0782,4.4538,1.6568,2.4977,1.5021,2.8219,2.5108,0.9709,5.6374,1.8805,3.062,2.1149,3.0002,5.1357,2.5239,0.347,0.9258,0.2437,0.0003,1.9077,5.0807,5.151,2.34,2.9868,0.6539,0.4995,1.0066,1.0433,6.7684,0.8662,2.8512,2.1691,0.0398,1.2511,1.0794,2.2168,4.0308,0.6397,5.1723,0.7649,0.5097,0.2114,4.3058,3.0251,0.0249,6.0136,0.4063,1.5184,0.0149,1.971,3.0426,3.7369,0.0073,0.9414,2.8669,0.0193,4.0794,5.1306,0.6326,1.3354,4.2537,1.2966,0.151,0.5264,4.0787,1.6219,1.2716,1.4505,7.4747,0.1226,0.9505,0.755,1.5108,2.8347,0.3382,6.1391,0.9388,2.0348,2.8128,0.6456,0.7959,3.1427,2.829,5.7528,0.0445,0.9623,3.916,2.3198,1.7492,0.234,3.0607,4.2819,1.1832,2.5229,1.4159,1.973,1.2423,3.0198,4.7674,0.0139,0.6933,1.4067,0.3841,5.1114,0.9168,0.8089,2.7475,3.6387,1.6068,1.2776,0.4034,0.0003,4.3861,0.7579,5.1831,3.0298,5.3916,0.1622,6.4043,0.579,0.2513,4.1226,7.2166,1.0964,1.3543,7.586,0.2719,0.3689,4.0242,1.0104,1.0055,0.8033,2.2193,1.7977,1.2855,2.7069,0.2654,2.717,2.7547,1.8641,1.5551,3.093,6.0655,4.5643,3.8378,0.0119,6.7503,1.8265,4.8382,5.1131,6.2671,0.7301,3.9686,0.2063,1.4701,3.5512,2.5206,1.318,5.1695,2.6614,5.9084,0.5406,0.3904,9.0274,0.0755,2.8192,2.2952,0.4742,3.3448,0.5473,1.4621,0.4089,1.3002,4.8712,3.8993,1.516,2.2739,1.0175,5.3889,1.7695,4.1307,3.3639,2.0132,2.4598,0.6445,0.4173,4.7433,3.2709,5.7027,0.1585,0.7941,0.5406,0.0003,3.3019,5.0232,3.233,3.2343,0.9114,0.9312,9.7466,9.2533,0.11,0.6227,0.9757,1.4838,4.463,0.0421,1.2775,3.0778,0.0171,2.156,3.226,5.0888,0.044,4.3325,2.2505,0.97,11.6557,0.1042,3.4462,1.517,3.7154,2.4131,1.7873,0.8591,3.7826,5.5794,0.0704,0.472,2.7471,0.0075,0.0001,0.0043,0.7415,1.1211,4.9571,2.751,0.805,3.3795,5.0954,3.0758,14.4748,0.1642,0.0559,0.0059,6.7482,1.8989,5.0992,1.7297,1.3508,3.2847,6.611,7.2267,3.2209,1.2816,3.16,0.0711,4.4847,4.7659,3.3805,1.8729,6.6625,0.7503,2.6793,1.1891,3.1506,2.4367,0.2308,0.2362,2.8408,0.0951,5.1859,0.2145,1.8637,5.8912,2.7075,1.431,5.2749,5.0156,0.316,1.4256,0.4213,1.5965,0.7175,3.0236,0.3912,1.9904,2.4423,1.5019,3.5484,3.8582,4.7915,0.3365,0.8899]}
{"id":2781,"ended":false,"length":519,"text":"Love in the Time of Cholera ( El amor en los < unk > del < unk > ) was first published in 1985. It is considered a non @ - @ traditional love story that reflects on the relationship between the main female character and a much older man. The story spans twenty four years, from the time she was fourteen and she first met him, till she is 31 and he is now 73. At the same time it reflects the difficulties that come with not accepting the natural changes that are part and parcel of growing up, the need for growth and change as individuals and also the need to accept that not everything happens for a reason. In the end we learn that her experiences allowed her to see more clearly who she is, that what had seemed important at the time was not actually as important to her as she had first believed, and that at the end of her own personal journey we discover that the whole story was a beautiful picture of how to deal with life in all its glory, the good and the bad. At the end of the novel we have all followed the characters through all of their trials and we have followed them with a great sadness because we know that life for our main female character would not work out well. In the end love can never overcome everything. There is a reason why everything happens the way that it does, but what we really need to understand is how to deal with it as individuals and how to take it all in stride. El amor en los del and its sequel El amor en los < unk > de < una > were both adapted into films, with the former one starring Juan Pablo De Oliveira, Claudia Cardinale, and the latter having been directed by Alejandro Amenabar and starring Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem. El amor en el tiempo de Cholera was later made into a book by the author himself, which has since sold over 35 million copies worldwide. It has been translated into many different languages and has been compared to Shakespeare for the skill with which it has been written. On August 10, 2009 the novel El amor en los < unk > de < una > got released as a movie < on-line < > at < >. A true classic of the era.\n\nI thought El amor in los del would be somewhat different from the other novels I review. But it's not. It is just as beautiful and as heartbreaking and, yes, even a little bit scary at times. And it was an amazing experience getting to know all those characters in a way that I don't know how you'd experience it if you read. But I highly recommend it.

{"id":2609,"ended":true,"length":534,"text":"In the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of religious tracts dealing with the literal and symbolic interpretation of the Bible. A manuscript Newton sent to John Locke in which he disputed the fidelity of the King James Bible was one of these. Newton wrote a separate tract about \"The Devil and His Works.\" Newton, while being a Christian, was also a deist, believing in God as a \"Spirit.\" He did not see any physical evidence for the existence of God. The Devil, for Newton, was a being that \"takes advantage of human credulity.\" At the time, the Church believed and taught that evil was caused by one's \"sins.\" From this perspective, evil did not exist by itself but rather was the result of the human will. Newton was a materialist who believed that all matter was ultimately derived from the one source - God. He rejected this idea, considering it to be a \"false hypothesis.\"\n\nHe also rejected the notion that there were any actual human beings that were in charge or had control of any natural phenomenon, let alone God. According to Newton's \"Satanic Worship,\" the devil was a being that lived on Earth and could take the forms of animals, but not human beings. It was the human being who was the one in power. The Devil \"enjoys our fears and anxieties.\" However, as his main tool, he used human free will to manipulate human decisions and actions. Like other religious texts of the time, both Locke and Newton argued against the idea of original sin and the concept of original sin, which they believed to be a religious concept created to blame the individual for the sins of others and the sins of the human race.\n\n\"The Devil and His Works\" is considered to be the major work where Newton addressed the influence of Satan over mankind. The text was later published as \"Satanic Worship,\" a pamphlet. Newton believed there were three levels of Hell. The first, called the Lake of Fire, is for those who willfully disobeyed God. The second, called the River of Fire, is for those who willfully do evil things even once and even if they do not know the \"wickedness.\" Lastly, the Lake of Eternal Damnation is for those who are the most \"infamous sinners.\" He proposed that Hell actually exists, and that as he viewed it, there was no chance of forgiveness. However, he argued that at the Judgment, all will be judged by God alone. In spite of this belief, Newton insisted that he did not believe there was any Hell for Satan.

{"id":1107,"ended":true,"length":519,"text":"Meginness ( 1892 ) wrote that `` Plunkett's Creek township, on account of its dashing mountain streams of pure water, has always been a favorite place for trout fishing. `` In the past year, the small town of Plunkett has a much improved physical condition, and the river water has an excellent reputation for clarity of taste and quality. The stream affords sport for both children and adults, and visitors to the town can easily wade across the stream for fishing.\n\nThe best fishing for trout is in the spring, from late March through early May. The largest size caught are on the fly, and generally between 3 and 6 pounds.\n\nThe best time to catch trout is before and after rains, but the fish are often found in the river in the middle of the day. If not caught by fly, try to catch trout on a night crawler or an imitation of either. The best time to catch trout on a fly is between 5 and 7 A.M. and between noon and 3 P.M. The best place for all fishing is in the mouth of the river and below that point, where the stream is shallow and clear or muddy and clear of riffles. The trout seldom leave the banks and it is the easiest place for a person to fish; however, this is not the only place where good fishing can be had. The best time to fish is when you feel the first spring flush of the trout.\n\nFishing is best on cold days, preferably when the thermometer reads above 20 Degrees, but also on warm days. If fishing on warm days, it will help to wade through the cold water into a spot where the water is running at a slow current. The reason for the slower current is that the trout in winter will seek shade from the sun ; also that shade protects the trout from the cold current to which the stream is exposed until it reaches deeper water. In the spring, when the trout return to the river, they leave the shade of the stream to swim in it.\n\nDuring the summer, the river is very muddy and very difficult to wade, and even if you do not mind the mud it is difficult to get a good fish because most of the trout lie far below the mud. In the spring, the stream is clear and easy to cross and the water runs at a slower current.\n\nAt least 1 hour of fishing on a cold day produces more trout, because the trout are not afraid of you. On spring fishing days, after fishing a place that has a slow current for about an hour you can start fishing where the water is running faster; thus, reducing the amount of time you spend there fishing.","token_len":550,"entropy":[12.0362,4.6547,9.5583,4.9474,2.2584,5.5403,2.1494,9.5947,12.4701,4.2331,0.1226,1.9111,9.2778,12.2192,2.3691,3.2916,6.2021,0.0136,0.8272,7.915,4.4924,8.4053,6.4499,4.5305,6.6154,1.8069,0.414,2.9952,3.4306,0.718,1.7695,4.1171,1.8134,1.0645,5.9591,2.4539,1.9308,6.2713,3.1348,2.3063,5.1273,3.5112,0.8725,2.0034,6.086,1.3042,1.2746,2.0285,0.0019,0.0016,0.974,6.3228,6.6595,4.8861,9.3149,0.395,1.1478,1.6428,2.1822,3.1314,4.5551,1.2602,6.7767,2.6245,5.1542,0.8888,7.1581,3.3876,6.3483,1.3101,3.721,1.5835,1.8052,5.3287,10.1723,0.0203,8.2418,3.5055,2.4653,5.2389,0.0672,0.3643,1.2589,0.6257,6.4911,2.0784,0.5961,1.0059,2.0654,3.9387,8.0191,0.2416,3.8963,0.6317,3.0001,2.9347,5.6308,1.4135,4.0811,0.0035,2.3392,5.0442,2.2924,3.6729,0.4577,0.8167,2.0869,0.608,3.462,1.355,5.8632,3.1582,3.3036,1.0696,0.7853,2.6112,0.6972,1.6022,6.3771,5.3529,7.2555,3.9989,5.7611,1.0248,8.73,0.8164,1.7465,5.657,5.3828,3.493,0.7923,1.6703,1.9187,0.9148,3.0124,0.0002,1.8984,2.3488,3.1656,0.3185,1.0681,0.8364,0.3259,5.2856,4.3263,0.2885,5.6181,1.3095,2.8757,2.4112,4.9751,1.5904,3.1665,3.8413,1.0514,1.4509,5.1886,3.6035,1.4608,3.315,0.0363,0.451,1.0058,0.9872,3.5941,3.9997,1.9221,3.7559,9.961,1.1503,5.2812,1.1868,0.6471,3.1116,2.6986,2.0489,5.9403,10.2961,0.7766,1.7449,5.4732,9.2769,1.3395,8.9926,1.3115,2.318,1.6275,0.8046,0.1971,0.239,0.2866,3.2769,0.7606,6.4157,0.1849,2.9795,2.4248,0.5134,1.4564,6.3439,0.0099,0.0815,0.7448,2.6519,3.4861,5.1609,0.0659,1.6517,0.7877,0.0007,0.0117,0.3397,1.5663,0.929,4.6295,2.5095,7.4599,3.4142,0.4242,1.4372,0.34,6.5113,0.1048,0.292,1.3451,3.5539,4.7142,5.2622,4.7863,2.1136,2.6452,1.1754,3.5626,1.1676,3.9466,1.0967,3.5299,7.9667,5.9691,3.2789,5.026,1.4842,9.2502,0.7709,0.8668,1.8143,2.5024,6.1728,4.4557,0.3994,6.8533,2.6493,4.6896,0.3663,3.8397,4.4791,1.835,1.4312,2.5973,5.1388,0.1675,2.8828,5.548,2.3511,0.0661,5.0085,0.7303,1.1228,1.9486,2.5277,1.0499,1.2214,6.6745,1.802,1.7958,0.15,3.3666,0.4266,2.0828,1.1018,1.3328,0.2192,1.6764,0.9475,2.6935,2.8378,4.2166,2.0,5.5753,4.9443,6.1337,2.1369,1.5591,3.1258,1.1245,1.4569,0.0002,4.1282,0.3419,2.5801,3.3175,2.9175,5.4194,1.7853,1.1595,7.5209,3.8619,0.7001,6.813,0.2535,3.5243,4.8944,3.3551,5.6944,1.0905,3.1371,2.2429,2.7795,2.288,2.1436,0.203,1.6276,3.0921,4.1511,2.6252,3.2465,0.166,0.3752,2.8954,3.2974,4.0015,0.6456,7.6942,0.0457,1.2288,0.3345,4.4563,0.9802,5.3123,2.8663,5.1461,1.3964,1.0164,2.1811,1.0639,7.2743,3.5574,1.1587,4.6883,6.0585,0.6966,2.1181,6.649,0.6377,2.3527,4.2788,0.819,0.3449,0.811,0.7753,2.3191,5.2428,7.4262,2.0885,6.3596,6.7577,2.1283,0.6696,4.2528,9.8669,5.4027,3.8675,5.0852,7.1147,0.8284,1.0393,0.2368,1.3776,1.5519,7.4444,6.2104,0.9083,1.7656,3.6677,0.9235,3.1964,7.9427,0.9414,2.135,7.2502,1.5064,0.5963,3.1313,1.711,1.7014,0.5337,2.4372,0.3806,3.46,6.008,0.3396,0.462,1.4299,0.6282,1.4511,6.7107,1.1477,7.6094,1.9059,0.4297,2.4619,2.6703,3.4992,2.2811,3.7149,1.1295,1.4663,0.0002,4.2708,0.5314,1.5144,0.545,1.4087,3.1315,1.5411,3.2151,4.2526,0.6773,3.8616,4.6177,0.1325,4.3584,0.0076,6.038,1.2357,4.4414,2.0571,0.934,1.9693,2.8102,5.1266,1.728,3.5023,4.0884,1.5231,3.2885,0.1317,2.4179,2.3618,0.6676,4.5086,6.1131,4.8739,0.5657,0.1375,2.2641,5.9808,5.8001,1.7537,0.2437,5.8662,0.8813,2.8966,0.9044,1.2347,0.4991,1.3652,3.3603,0.7825,2.9691,0.8456,3.9346,0.1747,4.9568,2.6899,2.1608,2.1843,5.7393,2.3379,0.3202,5.0364,0.7585,0.6986,1.6873,0.0002,5.1954,3.6272,4.3352,4.4841,2.5413,2.7124,3.4467,1.625,2.2466,0.2483,6.4453,4.4058,0.6734,3.5385,4.0269,0.8654,2.4961,1.6432,2.9098,5.4538,0.8552,6.0179,1.1471,4.1339,6.0917,4.1567,1.6406,0.3337,5.7146,6.8266,3.6778,9.0326,3.6311,2.0022,1.811,5.9245,0.6822,3.8154,3.5693,2.9563,0.0081,5.0532,1.1178,4.5901,3.4412,6.1854,0.8101,1.799,0.3226,2.0862,5.1671,4.2758,5.9454,0.8644,8.2267,0.2865,2.5174,0.0443,1.2236,0.9972,1.6996,5.4516,9.4344,0.5263]}
{"id":4596,"ended":true,"length":511,"text":"After returning to Pola, Tegetthoff kept his fleet in the northern Adriatic, where it patrolled against a possible Italian attack. The Italian ships never came, and on 12 August, the Germans withdrew back to the Istria. Although they managed a few engagements here and there, the German commanders were reluctant to risk much by way of an attack on Pola, so they merely harassed the landings at Pola and on 5 September, the Germans withdrew to the Istrian peninsula again.[21]\n\nOn 6 October, the fleet left port again, bound north into the Adriatic to attack the Italians in the Pertica Gulf. On 10 October, the German ships reached the area of the Ionian Sea but the Italians had had the foresight and were well prepared to meet them ; as they approached, they began firing from shore at the oncoming German ships. As the crews prepared to dive away from the shore firing, a shell struck the mainmast of the light cruiser, and that was the end of the Kaiserin Victoria. The ship sank, sinking in less than a minute. Only thirty men managed to make it to safety, and all of them were captured by the Italians. The Kaiserin Victoria became the first German warship to be lost in the war, and one of just six ships that were captured by the Italians as part of their early gains in the war.\n\nAt dawn on the 11th, the Italian forces managed to bring the fighting on land up to the water's edge, and it was decided to pull back for the time being. On 6 November, the German fleet had returned to Pola, but the Italians had not gone anywhere. They had been strengthened by a number of warships, and were able to occupy the position they had occupied before the conflict. On 24 November, the first actual naval action of the war took place, when the German fleet attempted to retake the Ionian islands. Although the Italians repulsed the Germans, they were unable to force an entrance to the area, so the fight did not last long.\n\nBy the end of November, the Italians had brought their numbers up to more than 600 warships, and the Germans still couldn't get in to engage them. Early in December, the Germans attempted to invade Albania from the north in an attempt to isolate the Italians in northern Greece, but they failed horribly when they were ambushed by the Italians on 28 December and driven back to Pola. Even though they got back into the Adriatic, they were unable to break out of those confines in a way that allowed further operations against the Italians ; by early January, the Germans decided to turn their attentions to the Balkans.","token_len":551,"entropy":[8.4989,0.903,10.101,5.1901,1.0731,7.6927,7.9301,8.5533,9.1443,6.1555,1.9235,8.561,2.1008,1.8677,6.4883,8.0,0.3462,0.001,1.7178,2.2287,1.9708,9.043,0.0024,5.0001,3.3055,5.5227,5.834,1.5381,0.7494,2.3184,3.1833,4.678,6.5538,2.7222,3.4751,0.9642,5.1198,3.7932,2.2031,1.6497,2.417,3.5908,4.3143,4.1296,0.442,1.4829,5.863,4.2666,2.792,0.6709,5.3559,2.3507,4.5114,5.3269,2.8326,4.5132,6.2934,0.4885,0.0074,0.23,1.5748,3.1635,4.8378,1.5934,4.46,0.0354,4.0993,5.9609,3.652,3.8511,0.0013,4.0628,1.74,0.8298,4.9246,0.0111,1.4112,2.9075,0.9954,7.0107,7.9712,0.5979,7.3007,1.8679,2.8649,3.3089,0.0571,1.8511,4.9058,6.9367,0.6721,1.4492,2.4494,2.0145,3.5925,1.4109,1.1586,2.4361,0.0295,1.483,3.2412,6.0271,5.0303,4.4697,0.0559,0.4405,0.004,2.582,2.3069,1.7085,0.3266,1.4059,5.5082,4.2014,7.2958,6.0053,1.1714,6.9133,8.2218,6.5727,1.0444,1.6409,0.0065,0.0011,3.8025,3.6031,0.8412,2.7617,2.5307,1.0365,6.1701,5.3246,6.1236,6.4275,0.6845,2.3982,3.5603,0.291,0.3201,0.9659,2.221,2.8451,3.9941,0.8801,4.8205,1.9685,1.1442,2.6798,6.8685,3.0394,5.8377,2.8855,2.5103,3.3398,6.7814,4.1095,5.8105,0.2032,3.0669,3.9192,5.2808,1.5962,0.9804,5.0054,1.0017,12.0086,4.4391,1.7688,4.7726,1.8135,1.6967,3.6806,3.5724,3.3879,5.6895,2.8365,0.4949,8.1069,0.0694,1.4068,0.5923,0.911,3.3647,1.1598,6.5557,4.3535,0.504,6.4108,6.2664,2.0596,0.3966,4.5311,9.4953,1.7079,2.4888,5.6006,2.4415,1.0012,5.5068,0.3226,1.3206,0.4485,7.7286,0.2964,1.615,2.0944,5.7833,1.7493,1.5436,1.0293,0.0809,0.5576,10.9708,10.9706,12.6478,1.0775,1.3924,4.0279,2.8168,1.4648,5.0773,2.3882,6.1065,0.0145,1.4537,0.4923,1.0454,5.4789,5.7846,2.8409,4.7926,0.0335,3.7192,0.1039,1.6011,1.7479,1.2578,1.1858,4.075,2.4887,0.4362,0.8497,3.6782,1.8773,0.2243,2.4258,0.5615,1.4617,2.4661,0.1361,0.3269,4.9682,0.9846,1.1134,1.6112,4.8857,0.0003,0.4075,1.2875,3.5338,0.8885,0.9535,4.2071,1.4019,0.7357,4.8287,0.1017,7.0713,3.4353,2.7899,3.2382,2.4834,4.2013,1.6428,0.3446,1.8903,5.086,1.9348,0.0004,3.2805,7.73,7.2007,1.9257,0.7429,1.2924,0.522,0.6376,0.0002,4.0061,4.6071,0.2188,2.4759,3.5856,0.0928,1.4052,0.9053,4.2941,2.999,5.0715,0.1109,5.3615,1.2104,6.8325,4.4576,8.1536,5.5156,0.275,1.4207,6.1886,1.1492,0.0789,1.0009,1.198,4.3808,0.3367,4.2562,0.7887,5.9551,0.9208,4.1026,1.5365,2.3491,0.0133,0.6112,2.4852,4.4695,0.3585,0.1942,0.8799,2.3183,1.4802,3.2346,4.7948,0.4539,1.8459,0.0015,0.878,2.0214,1.5516,2.6875,1.4914,1.9993,5.2867,4.8644,1.2475,3.8736,1.9278,2.8569,8.2024,0.892,2.399,3.2122,0.0009,6.2136,1.153,1.045,3.0919,3.6163,0.0367,5.688,0.9311,5.6592,3.115,0.345,0.7323,3.0694,1.6148,6.8951,1.8504,2.3295,5.4895,0.1395,0.1872,0.8534,5.0591,7.871,4.5072,3.4319,2.3354,0.1604,0.9102,1.1374,0.0011,1.4205,1.9759,0.6497,2.2638,1.3114,4.8485,0.2118,4.5268,0.6651,2.8414,0.7698,4.2447,1.7351,4.2328,0.8325,2.2016,8.9139,0.0625,0.0062,0.3512,3.563,1.3303,1.1696,1.3983,1.8054,0.0239,4.5226,3.7319,5.6441,2.2802,0.4291,3.7688,1.8343,2.4744,0.8038,6.3428,4.5538,0.155,2.171,0.2589,0.373,1.7143,0.0002,3.5956,1.1232,1.4102,0.0013,2.2884,0.3054,0.6092,3.0383,0.4712,5.1576,2.6929,5.0475,2.2478,0.122,4.9964,0.0095,4.5153,4.7248,0.6429,0.8948,1.6777,2.8535,4.702,7.6023,0.0015,3.0904,3.6136,3.5004,4.8067,1.3215,0.5292,7.8932,0.825,0.556,0.2123,0.9803,2.3753,4.8655,0.2236,4.4182,8.7275,3.95,0.7223,2.1803,4.2961,2.94,0.2263,0.0191,6.5648,0.7136,2.9416,3.2988,5.0045,3.6888,1.5876,0.3588,2.3025,2.8602,7.6197,4.7607,1.37,2.7344,4.4735,0.0004,0.5583,0.6751,2.2193,2.4214,4.3054,0.1818,3.3163,5.1264,0.4991,1.0961,1.3946,0.0013,0.4999,5.6368,1.8694,2.0457,5.2407,2.779,2.6449,0.9296,3.0256,0.0029,0.0016,0.8702,1.6147,1.2802,1.985,0.0067,3.9121,3.3708,0.3956,6.6027,5.0719,3.6513,3.5129,3.466,0.2748,3.1859,8.4961,5.3985,3.2145,0.3247,1.2829,9.1759,4.468,4.2602,0.7757,0.2881,0.8232,1.032,6.8533,0.3517,4.6466,0.9193,3.2936,0.002,0.566,0.9631,3.3002,1.2752]}
{"id":3917,"ended":true,"length":513,"text":"Haggard contended that romances such as She or King Solomon's Mines were best left unrevised, because `` wine of this character loses its bouquet when it is poured from glass to glass.''[28] She was also averse to the possibility that a future reader might pick up a romance and get a good laugh at the time she had spent writing it, if she happened to see \" the author of this book sitting in an old-fashioned easy chair, with legs crossed, reading aloud from a book, and enjoying himself as she did at this very moment.'' [28] Thus, if the reader picked it up later, it would not be a laugh but a pity.\n\nBut the critics and readers who read her books did not share her fears about their future saleability. The critics considered Shakespeare to be a great writer, but he has never sold more than a handful of reprints, except a few Shakespeare plays which appeared in print more than once under different titles. If romances and novelists can do as well as Shakespeare, there would be no problem. The problem, it would seem, was that no one bothered to discover these books and, therefore, they could not have sold themselves and failed to sell. Thus, Haggard took her books and tried to make them better by giving them a better title than the one in her original hardcover edition. She gave them a title more in keeping with the type of books actually sold to her customers. And she gave them cover pictures that showed the lead character in a more appealing light, but also looked like the cover of a book that had just been recommended at the front desk of the local library.\n\nWhen the cover copies were delivered to the bookstores, Haggard did not expect the publisher to give them out for free. Instead, she sent a postcard announcing the change in title. The bookstores could then start advertising it.\n\nSoon the books were flying. When the dust settled, Haggard found herself with more than thirty novels in print.\n\nWhen Haggard heard that the publisher had lost money, she decided that she ought to get something extra. After all, it had taken her four years to write them, and it had taken the publisher only six months to print, sell, promote, and distribute them. Furthermore, she had spent a lot of money on advertising. She deserved a share of the profits.

{"id":4252,"ended":true,"length":517,"text":"In the mid @ - @ 1980s, Valiente began writing an autobiography in which she focused on her own place within Wiccan history. It would be published by Hale in 1989 as The Goddess Within [link] She was one of the very first female Wiccans to publicly promote the ideas of the Craft, and while she has written a wide variety of novels, many of which have been quite successfully marketed, her true calling has always been the writing of Wiccan history.\n\nShe began researching her own background in the late 1980s, and has collected a vast quantity of information, interviews, and documents along the way. The first published research into her early life - her experiences as a young girl in Catholic Mexico, her subsequent move to Los Angeles in her early teens, and her initiation into the Craft in L.A.'s Sunset Strip - was done under her maiden name, Maria Valiente. In 1995 she started work on a more detailed account of her early life, which would become The Goddess Within. At this time, she was also investigating all of the known women Wiccans of the time - a number of whom ended up being part of or working for the Salem Witch Trials. As work progressed on the larger project, she also took on a number of other projects; one of which included a short historical novel for children in 1999 called I Was Queen of the Witches, which was originally going to be a series, although this appears to have been dropped. She has also written one other children's book about witchcraft, I Am King, but also many adult titles.\n\nShe continues working on various books at any given time. When asked in an interview in 2005 by her publisher if she had anything in the hopper she was actually working on right now, she replied with: \"yes, I am working on a children's book about a little boy named Sebastian, who becomes a wizard. Sebastian lives in a castle in France. I like the idea of the castle. I like the idea of Europe... And I like it now, because Sebastian gets to grow up and be a wizard. He's going to be a child wizard.\" This was published in the same year which saw her return to the Wiccan Festival circuit.\n\nShe's also been working for some time now on a biography of her husband, and Wiccan priest William Alexander Scott III (aka W.A.S. or \"Ace\"). He passed away in 2011.

here\nCringing so hard\nIn a chair\nI can't bear\nCan't face the winter\nI don't know\nIf I'm staying up\nIf I'm going down\nBut it's not enough\nIn my life to lose\nSomeone so close\nYou had to turn\nAnd leave me there\nThe winter came and\nYou left me on my own to suffer\nI feel like you were\nA light in a dark place\nI need you by my side\nJust to feel alive\nWithout you\n\nWe were on the road\nI felt so alone in that small world\nBut there was nothing else to do\nI need you by my side\nJust to feel alive\nWithout you\nI need you by my side\nJust to feel alive\nWithout you\nI need you by my side\n\nI'm not giving up\nI wanna prove them wrong\n\nI wish I could\nYou make me strong\nI would give anything\nJust to prove you wrong\n\nAnd there's not one thing\nThat's gonna change me now\nAnd I still wake up\nIn this empty room\nLike I've never found\nSomeone so close\nYou had to turn\nAnd leave me there\nThe winter came and\nYou left me on my own to suffer\nI feel like you were\nA light in a dark place\nI need you by my side\nJust to feel alive\nWithout you\n\nI need you by my side\nJust to feel alive\nWithout you\nI need you by my side\nJust to feel alive\nIt's not enough\nIn my life to lose\nSomeone so close\nYou had to turn and leave me there\nThe winter came and\nYou left me on my own to suffer\n\nMy dear\nWe'll have it all\nMy dear\nWe'll have it all\nMy

{"id":1576,"ended":true,"length":499,"text":"An area of disturbed weather south of Acapulco organized into Tropical Depression Six @ - @ E on June 29 and the system began to move northwest. Originally the system was expected to reach the Baja California Peninsula by yesterday, but late Wednesday heavy rains and strong winds in excess of 35 mph began to affect coastal areas of the Baja California Peninsula and southwestern California, with forecasters saying it \"may now have a chance of strengthening over the next 72 hours.\"\n\nIn a special bulletin issued at 4 p.m. PST, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said the depression is centered about 110 miles (175 kilometers) northwest of Manzanillo, Mexico, and is moving northward at 9 mph (15 kph). It had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph). Forecasters expect the depression to be upgraded to a tropical storm on Thursday as it approaches the coast of northeastern Mexico. \"An increase in forward speed is expected later today, and the system is expected to turn northward and cross the northeastern coast of Mexico later tonight or early tomorrow. The center of the circulation will then gradually move inland over the mid- to upper part of Mexico tonight and Thursday,\" the NHC said.\n\nIn addition to Mexico\u2019s Baja Peninsula, Baja California Sur State and the coast of Mexico\u2019s Michoacan state have also been affected.\n\nMore than 17 inches (44.3 centimeters) of rain had been reported in La Paz, while other places reported more than 15 inches (38 centimeters). In some inland areas of Baja California Sur, which is closer to the storm, rainfall could reach 25 inches (64 cm), the U.S. National Weather Service reported.\n\nAt the same time, heavy rain in southwestern California has left at least 50 people stranded and at least five dead following a storm.

{"id":3574,"ended":true,"length":456,"text":"Dhanushkodi is the southernmost tip of the island and houses the < unk > Temple dedicated to Rama. Though Dhanushkodi was washed away during the 1964 cyclone, the temple alone remained intact. The temple is situated in a secluded corner of the island, surrounded by lush green forest. The temple is built on a rock, a fact that makes it seem quite out of the world. The temple is surrounded by four waterfalls which give an enchanting background for the temple. The temple has got a huge hall, with four walls, which is believed to be the hall of Rama and Sita. The fourth wall of the temple covers an ancient Shiva lingam and is believed to be one of the finest examples of rock carvings in the world. The outer walls and the entrance of the temple is covered with carvings of various Hindu deities.\n\nThe temple houses a variety of idols of Rama, Lakshmana, Sita, Laxmana and many others. There is also a stone in which Lord Rama is seen sitting in the pose of < ukha ukha >, which is believed to have been carved by Lord Ram or Lord Brahma < ukha ukha >. In addition, there are four big statues of Laksmans ( one of Laksmana, one of Rama as King, one of Lakshmana as a hunter and one of Hanuman as a monkey ). The temple also has an ancient idol of Shiva as Rishabhanatha who has his hand on the head of Lord Vishnu. The idol of Rishabhanatha at the temple is believed to be the only one in Asia.\n\nThe temple has a number of ancient religious scriptures. The oldest known scriptures, < sri arthamalika veetika and hanumanji rasya veda> are written on a stone plaque. The temple houses one of the rarest statues of Lord Shiva, made of copper and is believed to date back to 1500 B.C. The image of the deity is believed to have travelled from India to Sri Lanka.\n\nDhanushkodi is the ancient gateway which connects < kankadeya> with the south.

{"id":4156,"ended":true,"length":517,"text":"During the 1999 \u2013 2000 college football season, Virginia Tech went undefeated during the regular season but lost to Florida State in the 2000 BCS National Championship Game. In the offseason following the Orange Bowl \u2013 the bowl game between Florida State and Virginia Tech \u2013 a poll of writers, broadcasters, and pundits by the Sports Illustrated magazine ranked both teams 1-2-3, with #1 as Virginia Tech. But there was a twist for those of us who remember the ranking. The same poll ranked Florida State ahead of #2 Miami, which had lost to USC.\n\nThis is one of my favorite sports and I enjoy playing, watching and collecting baseball cards. In my youth I collected only football and basketball cards (although cards of players from other sports had to be very rare. In the late 1970s to early to mid 1980s I enjoyed baseball card collecting very much, but after that period I lost interest. I stopped collecting cards in 1988 when we moved to Florida and we didn\u2019t have room for our extensive collection in our small apartment. However, I have followed the sport ever since I stopped collecting and I have followed the business aspects of baseball card production, marketing and collecting.\n\nWhen I heard that the major professional sports leagues in the U.S.A. had reached a settlement where they agreed to the formation of a single entity as opposed to their individual unions, I decided to re-engage my baseball card hobby although this hobby is not limited to major league players and major league baseball teams. For this reason, I decided to focus my interest only on the game of baseball. Since 1993 I have become an avid player and collector of both modern (post-1990) and vintage (pre-1980) baseball cards.\n\nI believe that baseball cards are highly collectible and this hobby is not only for the most avid collectors, many of whom compete to see who can assemble a complete set. I also believe that each card carries a piece of the history of the game and the achievements of the players for whom it was issued.\n\nDuring this period I have become an active participant in my hobby and actively participate in four major leagues:\n\n1. The hobby which most influences the hobby of collecting baseball cards is the hobby of collecting modern (post-1990) baseball cards which are produced by the major professional sport franchises.\n\n2.

{"id":7,"ended":true,"length":519,"text":"In the late 1920s, Barker began to doubt she was doing enough for the church and considered focusing solely on sacred works. Family and friends recommended she continue secular and sacred works, however, which became the direction of Barker's career. In a letter to artist and close friend Mary Cassatt, Barker wrote: \" My present work was begun in 1925 out of the conviction that only through the medium of art did I see any true measure of the importance of the religious ideal today. My paintings from the standpoint of art are mainly inspired, in some sense, by my desire to see the spiritual significance of the world of art. And it is for this reason that my present work leans more distinctly toward the sacred than the secular. My religious work deals with themes which touch and influence the thoughts of humanity. With all sincerity I wish to be of service in giving back to the public a better understanding of the divine spirit. \" [18]\n\nBarker's works in the 1930s are more overtly religious works in which she depicts both religious motifs and scenes in more conventional forms. The following paintings are an example of this style:\n\nBarker's 1930 painting A Night of Prayer, showing Christian worship, was the inspiration for the 1939 musical The Nightingale.\n\nOn April 9, 1941, the United States declared war on Japan in response to the attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1942, Barker was commissioned to paint the National Cathedral window showing the Last Supper. In February 1943 Barker left for Europe with the American Expeditionary Forces, but returned only nine months later in October 1943. Because of her lack of experience working at that large a scale, Barker decided to resume her work in the series of portraits of the religious figures whom she worked with between 1908 and 1909.\n\nBarker left Europe for the first time since World War II with the American forces on May 5, 1945. After the war she returned to Europe for a short time, but began working in the United States again.\n\nIn 1947, it was reported that a small museum in Paris, called the \"Collection d'Art Moderne, \" was preparing an exhibit of 19th-century French art. Among the paintings to be exhibited was one of Barker's, called The Angelique.\n\nThe artist in the painting is shown kneeling and supporting an infant. Barker's signature is painted on either side. The painting is part of a series of nine portraits, including those of a black minister, a rabbi and the Virgin Mary. The National Gallery of Art acquired those eight in a 1938 sale of paintings from the estate of Anna Marie Rittenhouse; The Angelique was purchased later from the same auction by the Musee de Beaux-Arts in Paris (see below).","token_len":560,"entropy":[2.6222,4.7182,4.0686,0.1258,0.4603,11.9095,3.5414,1.5404,7.0258,7.6333,1.2201,4.6052,2.6418,2.4898,1.4479,4.9537,2.6532,7.0194,8.7275,4.1147,0.0212,10.0206,4.4293,0.6233,8.9485,2.1487,0.4475,7.5888,1.6849,5.2456,7.9717,5.3047,7.8826,2.3184,1.2815,5.4171,0.6237,4.4807,4.7185,2.6677,5.6043,0.9472,3.6184,0.1634,2.9572,0.2695,2.2756,4.3817,1.7402,0.4979,9.5215,3.2369,8.1708,0.088,5.1944,8.3348,6.3345,0.6282,1.0451,1.1713,1.5056,0.7576,9.1294,6.5647,2.8848,4.0395,6.3281,1.8427,4.4354,8.1504,0.0261,1.8981,5.4584,0.2835,5.8835,3.97,1.7373,5.7473,0.0662,3.0254,5.5319,0.5014,4.0882,4.2461,4.6026,7.3077,0.0803,1.8061,5.3625,0.2095,1.2891,4.6728,6.6086,9.6873,0.7922,3.3005,6.1288,5.9758,1.3795,7.0125,0.0285,3.4404,1.9101,6.1513,5.3634,4.0963,3.0469,3.156,2.0907,0.1023,0.0678,3.8689,5.0115,0.2492,2.8928,1.1908,4.3463,4.9567,0.1536,1.052,3.3065,4.4823,3.0846,1.1992,4.0893,3.625,0.585,3.766,0.2377,0.2623,0.2314,2.5336,5.3263,0.4857,8.8049,1.8875,7.3521,1.7799,0.6954,5.0556,2.1494,1.8533,2.5885,1.1097,3.2759,4.9324,2.2279,6.629,0.5951,6.1352,2.5775,7.1428,3.8447,3.4838,0.933,6.3665,1.064,4.5624,1.7981,5.9002,3.7613,4.4724,1.1873,3.6851,0.4452,3.1811,4.026,1.0948,3.7476,5.5592,4.5894,0.4327,0.9667,5.3228,2.1109,4.1714,0.738,0.0628,0.726,3.8064,4.3312,1.7551,3.7434,5.492,4.7864,0.3036,0.6858,0.031,1.6097,0.0206,0.0045,1.2415,4.3938,3.7174,0.897,3.3519,0.0105,4.1773,4.8132,4.0767,0.8158,6.6832,3.6877,3.7107,2.0064,4.1429,6.0206,3.5361,7.9213,0.0107,0.3235,6.3186,3.1119,7.3108,5.8595,2.9787,0.4755,2.7378,4.2775,4.511,1.3372,4.9539,0.4642,0.2438,1.6748,4.1026,1.3403,0.2213,0.0002,2.0299,0.1224,0.0084,0.898,6.9243,3.8676,5.0126,6.1744,1.3479,4.4443,2.1139,4.284,6.1105,4.8599,2.7419,2.6676,3.3183,3.6565,0.1941,1.3303,6.4689,6.4751,3.1322,4.5081,5.6319,0.0502,0.9061,2.0534,0.0001,5.2204,4.1762,3.3145,0.106,2.2873,0.1613,2.5329,4.2561,0.0603,5.9127,0.2699,0.26,0.509,2.9545,3.1149,0.0024,0.7895,4.3987,0.4415,0.005,0.0165,0.4452,2.2594,4.0663,0.1454,1.3239,2.3657,3.6665,0.7449,2.2166,1.5121,6.4359,3.6991,11.0408,5.3911,0.9042,8.0617,1.205,0.0002,1.4718,2.0745,5.0071,1.0588,4.3097,4.8964,2.8779,3.3203,2.9266,1.6278,3.1695,5.3566,0.0331,1.3649,1.7768,2.9587,2.0473,3.1916,6.7755,1.0728,0.0364,3.4191,4.1229,0.976,0.76,6.6505,0.4601,1.2739,3.4845,0.0012,2.6543,3.2999,3.871,5.9163,7.4575,4.9953,1.4377,1.1457,1.208,3.8303,0.2619,7.6571,0.812,0.977,1.4092,1.4107,8.7303,1.6226,4.8337,2.1021,1.7518,6.1013,1.7696,6.0397,0.2318,4.6116,0.1384,7.0064,8.5723,0.0627,4.5018,0.2391,1.4549,0.0001,1.5033,0.055,0.005,5.4224,5.1428,1.8433,1.1195,5.475,0.1067,5.3335,2.1448,0.0012,0.6773,3.4327,0.6147,1.7551,5.8661,2.8054,2.4001,3.256,0.0192,1.4891,0.507,3.3841,2.5981,0.6415,1.7941,1.5777,0.0959,4.3362,2.1602,1.8666,2.7827,1.0828,1.9584,1.6848,4.7417,2.0271,1.714,1.3508,2.3526,0.077,2.7148,2.6005,2.4134,0.0001,1.501,4.107,0.4888,6.386,0.0937,1.7676,0.2189,4.3343,4.7227,6.2994,0.7435,4.772,1.8613,4.4584,1.1469,3.2138,9.1907,3.442,0.0835,1.5695,3.5125,0.0114,3.3329,4.9464,1.2908,6.4289,3.5999,1.1643,1.7198,8.0233,3.4618,1.1808,0.1196,3.394,3.1065,1.5772,5.5116,0.9467,2.6792,4.6041,0.1161,0.9282,2.4307,2.0121,1.7084,1.7054,0.126,2.69,5.2606,3.0635,5.8285,7.4044,1.8501,1.6362,0.0002,2.8794,3.2869,4.1957,1.4443,3.9947,1.7059,3.786,3.9929,3.2728,7.1216,3.0845,4.7431,2.3483,3.5956,1.8938,5.5511,1.2094,4.9783,0.983,5.6116,0.3071,2.117,1.4447,3.657,1.0666,4.7337,0.0225,0.9001,1.3247,0.2653,5.5624,2.8098,2.8241,3.2693,4.1651,0.496,3.454,6.4748,9.2622,1.3347,1.0233,7.2642,1.5749,2.9822,3.7332,0.1316,0.4214,1.2849,6.6594,2.9857,0.7676,0.9332,7.2269,6.055,4.5106,3.7676,3.922,7.7298,3.3924,2.4811,5.6969,2.4465,0.9397,7.8761,0.2981,7.7275,4.9282,5.2714,5.7639,0.3595,5.5482,5.9105,3.5205,0.0041,1.0487,2.744,6.1384,5.9995,0.9452,4.4854,2.7672,5.6607,2.021,6.595,0.7044,0.7032,5.8545,1.7353,0.6104,0.0038,0.0001,1.3133,1.8537,4.5458,2.328,2.6712,0.4209]}
{"id":999,"ended":true,"length":488,"text":"A disturbance in the ITCZ developed into a tropical depression north of Panama on October 14. Early on the following day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Katie. The system moved generally northward, and reached the Yucatan late on October 16, just south of Cancun. Intensification continued while the storm passed through warm Gulf waters, and the storm peaked with winds of 50 mph (85 km\/h).\n\nBy the time the storm emerged over the Bay of Campeche, it had sustained winds around 45 mph (75 km\/h). After moving into extreme southwestern and southwestern Mexico, the storm peaked with winds of 50 mph (85 km\/h) and had attained its peak intensity. The storm became extratropical on October 20, but maintained a tight circulation as it passed near Monclova, Mexico.\n\nSatellite imagery shows that the storm was fairly compact during its second half. This was also true on the surface; convection is shown by red and green in areas of active convection. The circulation around the storm was also fairly compact.\n\nIn southern Mexico, the storm spawned a small tornado, or possibly waterspout, along the coast. An F1 tornado (the weakest type of tornado) was recorded near the Veracruz city of Chetumal. No damage was reported. The tornado occurred within less than 10 miles (16 km) of the coast.\n\nTropical storm warnings were in effect for Mexico until late on October 21. Rainfall totals totaled 4 to 8 inches (100 to 200 mm). High winds downed trees on hillsides and knocked down power lines between Santa Catarina and Chiapas. The storm produced a mudslide in a city east of Chiapas where heavy rains caused a local river to overflow. The storm made landfall in the U.S. state of Texas on October 21 as a tropical storm, about 65 miles (105 km) south of Eagle Pass with maximum sustained winds of 39 mph (63 km\/h). At this time, Katie did not produce any damage to property or lives.\n\nTropical Depression 10W. The storm produced numerous rains on October 1 in western South America during its entire duration. This included over Costa Rica where several towns and cities experienced flooding. An F0 tornado was reported near the San Jos\u00e9 suburb of Alajuela. No significant damage was reported except for minor erosion and flooding.\n\nDuring the latter half of October 3, tropical depression 10W degenerated into a remnant low in the Atlantic. The remnant low briefly re-intensified to become a tropical depression on October 4.

{"id":4058,"ended":true,"length":524,"text":"On 19 September 1880, Parnell gave a speech in Ennis, County Clare to a crowd of Land League members. He asked the crowd, `` What do you do with a tenant who takes a lease? What do you do with a tenant who breaks his lease? What do you do with a tenant who makes a contract of servitude? '' He continued, ``You must first drive out the tenant, break his lease, cut off every vestige of his connection with his past, and then keep his farm from him, until, in the ultimate outcome, you have him and nothing but himself to give.''\n\nHis words were echoed by Terence MacSwiney who also gave similar speeches before the Land League held demonstrations in support of the movement in Limerick.\n\nThe Land League believed that to give people land for free would be wrong, and that it would be an infringement of their individual rights to allow people to possess land that was not theirs to own or occupy. They demanded free land for all in areas under military occupation.\n\nOn 25 July 1880, the day following his Land League address, Parnell took his seat in the British House of Commons. He was elected as the founder member of the anti-Parliamentarian National Party\n\nParnell made his position on the partition of Ireland clear, saying in his maiden speech ''In all our political life, we have been too prone to take decisions on the basis of generalization ; that is, on the basis of principles rather than on the basis of facts.''\n\nBut many of Parnell's supporters believed the partition needed to be completed, and that the Irish national question could be put by the government to bed. The partition of Ireland was already underway. It didn''t take into account the will of the people of Ireland, and it was unconstitutional.\n\nThe Treaty of Limerick, which had been signed on the 27th July, was not binding, because, Ireland was still in the state of war with Britain. And it was not binding on Britain because it was only signed by England. Ireland was still in the state of war with England, and that meant that the English government would still be able to attack Ireland if they chose to.\n\nThe Land League members were also angered by the Land League leaders who had agreed to the Treaty, and they questioned if the men had made it clear to the people of Ireland that they had made this agreement on the basis of a guarantee that there would be an Irish parliament and an Irish government in place before the Treaty was in force.\n\nThe Act of Union which created the Irish Free State on 11 November 1920 was not supported by the Land League which believed the new state had been betrayed after signing the Treaty of Limerick.","token_len":562,"entropy":[8.7311,2.8082,9.8024,0.4501,6.4156,5.4126,0.4459,5.9215,1.6571,1.5562,1.4954,9.2323,3.0903,1.0563,6.0032,5.3009,4.1617,1.9534,1.7663,0.1122,11.5557,6.3617,1.3377,1.298,1.3657,4.6807,2.1366,3.2444,2.6117,8.8024,7.165,1.7996,0.2757,3.9498,2.2519,3.0097,7.8479,1.166,5.5558,2.0086,4.6153,2.7577,2.3309,0.516,0.0468,0.2282,0.1519,0.2883,0.6994,0.0996,5.0695,1.7617,0.1858,0.6026,1.134,0.0752,0.0064,0.0194,0.0332,0.0957,0.1362,0.0718,4.4895,0.898,5.0253,3.2979,3.4387,0.1688,0.9654,4.055,2.3113,3.5337,0.6057,0.2061,5.1877,3.2351,5.424,7.9563,2.6579,0.921,1.3842,1.5865,5.8836,0.6308,0.5733,0.327,6.9881,0.901,5.348,5.4931,0.2274,0.0745,0.8646,8.2764,0.4504,1.6487,6.9715,0.8611,0.7774,1.0451,5.3622,2.2969,6.2658,4.6896,3.0215,2.3796,4.2728,4.8819,2.2693,1.1287,7.2973,6.6312,0.9545,1.4039,2.0452,3.4332,4.3794,6.5972,2.3323,4.5914,3.0819,3.4013,3.3777,1.8085,0.0084,5.3397,3.9263,1.237,4.5828,0.5421,7.0967,3.9745,5.5143,8.7216,4.2561,1.831,3.6858,4.9666,3.7642,4.3488,1.4567,4.6639,0.7397,3.2228,0.0532,4.9087,7.3022,1.2158,4.2862,0.026,1.242,6.0142,2.6295,8.0821,0.0129,0.7604,1.6442,0.0002,2.3474,1.8893,0.117,7.387,0.4649,5.3787,4.5761,5.1423,4.9698,4.0119,2.693,1.9086,1.4352,4.993,1.652,1.3083,2.0753,2.0723,1.5458,1.3679,3.332,3.1933,0.7928,1.2907,4.9236,0.6917,2.0843,7.2586,2.9643,0.2515,5.7742,1.2628,3.6779,1.9335,1.7027,0.4109,2.7026,1.5919,3.6497,5.7465,0.3063,2.626,5.2391,6.1625,2.7447,0.8466,1.5987,4.2998,5.5153,4.0282,7.8549,1.9832,1.1962,1.2268,0.0002,4.1617,4.1137,3.6464,1.2011,0.2366,1.6837,6.4071,3.9346,2.916,10.3345,0.0371,3.3363,0.156,1.6478,0.0036,0.0006,4.0024,2.193,2.9071,1.2,0.4328,8.4685,1.5453,0.4908,0.2546,0.9958,1.1087,1.7473,3.3991,2.5495,1.9438,8.0363,5.4458,0.1871,0.1905,9.0178,0.0691,7.4307,0.0339,1.9456,4.2276,1.8291,6.8253,0.0002,3.4033,0.0445,0.0025,4.958,1.6005,6.5743,3.5741,1.0706,9.0456,0.4121,0.1247,1.3671,2.6014,1.8363,3.6119,1.3469,8.4025,0.2654,5.749,4.9198,3.8226,2.7129,4.0978,3.3076,0.8363,1.5468,0.3375,2.1414,7.3964,7.225,0.0426,4.4103,5.6101,2.0997,1.0878,1.0014,0.0296,6.291,8.5641,7.5306,2.447,0.4633,0.9575,2.2567,0.6305,0.3246,0.0324,5.3211,4.4984,0.0156,2.2103,1.3027,0.9854,0.0067,2.9572,1.6471,0.6346,0.0002,4.7587,4.7958,1.7021,3.456,0.0014,0.0011,0.0015,1.2416,3.2549,2.7821,3.1946,8.2346,0.3216,0.2045,5.2747,2.0704,0.9956,1.641,1.4607,3.7192,5.7277,3.4911,3.1744,0.774,4.6955,6.6282,1.3045,4.1106,1.2057,6.2572,0.8589,2.9805,5.3189,2.626,0.2199,0.9587,5.3344,2.902,1.5496,3.3531,6.7484,11.0573,0.0005,1.1129,6.4014,0.1398,0.7084,6.8214,0.0695,0.4364,0.8253,2.062,0.7222,1.4146,1.6446,1.975,2.2721,7.2949,1.012,0.757,0.0002,1.8164,5.767,0.1449,2.8424,0.0013,1.9865,1.6427,2.8731,0.5532,0.5924,1.5856,4.0667,3.188,0.2359,3.0763,0.7162,2.4147,3.62,3.4318,1.9086,4.6721,4.3886,9.7756,1.3614,2.9618,2.4668,0.8749,4.9347,0.0211,1.794,2.0052,2.2339,0.6691,4.7242,2.6108,0.801,1.3059,1.1343,1.7042,2.6345,1.7656,1.4503,0.7982,4.9087,4.4869,1.4509,4.2649,0.7392,4.8771,1.0281,1.8562,1.2099,0.6744,0.5053,0.0067,0.0977,0.3827,1.7854,1.4092,0.8965,3.2341,2.5857,0.7866,1.3985,4.6062,1.678,2.2186,4.0761,1.4683,1.4151,0.0162,6.2455,0.9507,3.1703,1.5406,3.2968,0.567,0.9187,0.4597,0.0001,1.7344,4.1963,0.0256,4.57,2.0578,3.3002,4.8103,0.6679,0.6391,5.5857,3.1259,5.264,2.1871,1.9569,6.4895,0.374,2.5925,4.2146,2.6999,1.3799,2.445,5.6846,3.707,1.0849,6.4846,2.5794,4.0154,3.3419,0.9188,2.2653,0.8321,2.8301,1.4664,0.2436,0.3966,0.6228,2.3479,3.358,3.6639,2.7794,2.7528,0.9004,0.9587,0.1051,2.709,7.148,1.694,4.1045,0.2306,0.2599,4.8503,1.3348,5.833,2.5702,2.8548,0.4741,2.274,2.6417,2.6779,4.637,0.577,2.6945,0.5911,5.5027,0.2746,0.0985,0.3719,0.0001,1.464,7.0882,0.3103,1.6834,5.047,4.9385,0.3152,2.1855,8.0902,0.1385,3.7457,4.0532,3.0245,4.9536,1.8118,2.4256,7.1815,0.0939,0.5988,0.5995,0.0032,6.8562,4.5551,2.2535,4.9843,1.8394,3.1642,1.4956,6.0785,6.6336,5.1601,0.3978,0.5884,2.2545,1.2239,0.0009,0.4266]}

{"id":3608,"ended":true,"length":435,"text":"By mass, salvinorin A `` is the most potent naturally occurring hallucinogen. `` It is active at doses as low as 200 \u00b5g. Synthetic chemicals, such as LSD ( active at 10 \u00b5g ), are chemically related to salvinorin A. Chemically, the natural product is a member of the sesquiterpenoid family, related to the sesquiterpenes ( actinomycotins, cyperales, and flavonoids ) and the sesquiterpenoids ( pterostilbene [ pterocarpin ], diterpene glycosides, etc. ). In the natural product, the pterostilbene ( the carboxylic group of the flavonoid and the 7-methylene derivative of the pterocarpin ) is in the alpha position with respect to the methyl group of salvinorin A. Chemically, the natural product has the formula C 8 H 2 (C 7 H 5 O)N 4 ( C ) 3 (C 3 H 4 O) 0 + N 4 H 2 O. The natural product is extracted from a shrub native to the Amazon Basin ( and to the highlands of Columbia and Venezuela ) by boiling it in water. The pterostilbene is then isolated, purified, and dehydrochlorinated ( to make 2-hydroxy- 3 -methyl pteridine ). From here, one must separate the 3-methylpternidine of salvinorin A, which is also an active component of the plant, and which is similar in chemical structure to that of the pterostilbene. ##STR1##\n\nSalvinorin A has the pharmacological properties of a highly potent synthetic hallucinogen. Salvinorin A exhibits many hallucinogenic properties when administered orally to animals at a dose as low as 200 \u00b5g per kilogram. When administered intravenously, salvinorin A is an excellent local antiemetic.\n\nWhen a plant is first discovered and shown to contain a compound whose chemical structure is essentially similar to that of an active hallucinogen, one may wonder why it took such a long period of time before the compound's hallucinogenic properties were first discovered. The answer is that it would be relatively easy for the plant to produce substances with the same properties as those of hallucinogens at natural doses (200-400 \u00b5g per kilogram). However, it would be impossible for the plant to produce amounts of those substances in a way that could be observed. By the time that extracts of the plant have been sufficiently purified, it is possible to isolate the substance in which the hallucinogenic properties are present ( the active compound ).","token_len":563,"entropy":[9.2421,3.8393,10.1639,8.1093,0.7397,0.2584,2.8227,14.9262,6.1386,2.5997,1.4124,1.8226,8.5849,0.1344,4.4451,0.0014,0.6683,2.4186,5.7803,2.3688,0.7284,5.7604,1.974,1.6927,2.676,0.808,0.0068,3.8237,4.7569,0.1288,2.8357,8.8714,0.542,6.8161,2.4765,0.8028,0.0004,3.0529,3.4321,13.3113,0.3576,4.1416,0.8306,0.0527,2.8338,1.4375,4.6952,4.7625,0.1628,2.8177,0.0012,0.0271,0.0139,0.6056,1.1027,6.9247,1.4093,0.4054,2.3167,6.4077,5.052,1.2433,2.4374,7.7454,0.0032,0.5603,7.3141,3.0817,0.2306,0.2823,0.3434,0.6432,0.5389,1.4938,7.2837,0.1691,1.0622,3.2536,0.0168,0.0297,0.2208,0.3141,6.9604,3.4274,10.5546,0.0191,3.4688,6.9822,4.8824,3.5755,5.7637,4.2665,9.9137,0.8869,1.1532,5.782,0.9,0.2322,2.9521,1.4107,1.9827,2.781,0.007,0.0466,0.1754,0.0827,0.9082,0.4248,5.0747,5.3252,2.5164,1.9558,5.7894,2.03,6.6993,5.0418,0.8715,5.8288,2.3434,1.6749,1.7597,4.8697,5.273,1.9117,0.9872,9.9123,1.4043,0.9482,1.5719,5.3009,3.1936,1.5784,3.088,2.0514,5.0859,2.6506,0.4814,1.3315,5.0163,0.2413,0.2562,0.0272,0.0837,0.0008,2.7916,4.8567,6.6669,0.1352,1.1147,0.1265,4.0214,1.7697,1.1831,4.8153,0.0726,1.2541,6.3543,1.926,9.6787,0.3869,3.1884,3.4617,6.642,0.998,0.9491,2.5293,0.1162,3.5017,0.0373,0.0612,0.6969,0.8788,5.4858,1.7479,7.9171,5.5189,4.7739,2.4238,0.0018,0.6575,6.412,0.3976,1.6047,4.8603,0.0035,0.0114,0.0064,0.118,0.7965,4.6308,0.0498,0.0438,0.9349,4.0594,0.1499,3.0885,2.231,8.1883,3.6962,5.6249,2.0144,1.7983,6.3298,3.9828,3.0035,0.6626,4.2179,2.2414,1.531,9.1122,3.3103,1.4479,3.3567,7.231,3.433,0.8899,1.8781,3.2192,0.705,1.6386,0.4443,0.7786,4.9429,8.1052,4.6043,1.641,2.1062,0.5274,2.8697,2.2175,1.4536,3.3848,0.2961,0.9581,6.9248,0.7218,2.0901,8.3742,0.0456,7.0511,0.0357,1.2086,4.6634,3.6878,2.5507,6.5157,5.8316,1.6905,6.9738,1.1503,0.8507,9.0456,1.9727,6.7812,1.1714,1.3348,4.7502,3.1205,1.0507,1.7195,1.5181,1.1459,4.895,0.1774,0.1697,0.0109,0.0542,0.0007,1.532,2.7089,5.3853,2.6864,1.8153,0.2912,0.3262,6.8151,4.0558,1.6241,0.4678,3.0872,4.6564,3.8806,5.9024,1.626,2.5175,0.1469,0.6391,5.7086,3.351,1.3007,6.7512,1.2202,8.8482,3.2802,5.8246,5.5112,0.5106,5.6369,3.8392,4.7025,0.4422,5.2632,0.301,1.8991,2.2341,11.4724,4.3915,5.7742,2.2713,0.0027,0.0023,0.0026,0.0609,2.7586,2.2104,0.6464,3.7533,4.3529,1.6599,3.6578,0.5281,0.7142,4.2765,1.3849,2.0128,6.4703,0.7369,5.8396,1.1999,3.6801,1.4326,0.1949,2.0632,0.2468,1.3129,2.1756,0.0306,0.1104,0.0033,0.0378,0.0011,0.7405,12.3677,9.4187,6.217,3.0306,3.9487,0.025,6.7556,0.067,0.0043,0.0041,0.2001,4.0058,2.8416,6.1501,0.4154,0.9747,0.3056,2.3014,4.9954,1.7183,5.8853,0.2192,0.0004,0.0794,0.7969,2.8092,0.0376,0.0028,0.0044,0.0276,5.0277,4.044,5.292,0.0775,0.2663,0.4237,5.6176,2.4868,1.3732,2.9754,3.1915,5.6076,3.1001,0.6125,3.0642,0.3068,0.0038,1.351,0.1484,0.0023,3.2647,1.9785,0.0468,2.4887,4.6788,0.785,4.0265,0.0041,0.5133,1.8971,0.003,0.0019,0.0024,0.0131,1.6662,4.2082,3.4282,8.5217,4.232,2.9312,0.0518,1.7233,4.0118,0.0002,5.3075,3.9166,4.1045,0.8785,4.501,5.107,2.6727,6.6819,0.0811,5.1634,2.3807,4.7584,5.5615,3.2701,0.4133,0.7004,6.7986,1.8291,0.042,0.515,0.0755,3.8028,1.8724,0.6106,0.0002,0.0477,0.1748,3.6423,2.3626,3.3256,1.9584,1.2304,5.6747,1.9505,1.3436,0.0601,5.5903,0.4742,0.1667,2.8727,1.7436,2.7538,3.1838,4.1789,0.0435,0.3947,0.434,1.0975,4.9898,2.1031,0.4013,1.8557,1.7771,0.8717,0.7667,2.4497,5.4736,1.6642,5.2419,0.5463,1.6082,1.4886,1.3008,0.3223,2.6444,6.0363,2.1628,2.3454,0.6376,2.4931,0.8511,2.4073,0.8404,4.5184,0.0044,0.4365,5.2281,7.121,1.6173,3.4788,8.6586,2.1032,1.7937,0.1294,0.0032,0.7107,0.0651,0.0051,1.3402,2.3169,0.0068,2.7493,1.8056,0.6919,3.4939,0.8555,1.0267,0.4883,0.1842,0.5671,9.1629,0.5788,4.0839,1.0801,2.5451,1.7241,2.2933,0.2309,2.2977,1.3673,5.722,4.4527,5.7431,2.3566,0.5143,2.4491,6.0546,0.6399,1.872,0.8744,2.2165,0.2292,5.6944,2.4423,0.8648,2.6104,0.668,1.6763,0.6115,4.2182,1.1814,5.1986,2.3069,4.5988,1.772,2.3977,0.0146,0.4335,0.3473,1.1021,1.5941,2.9567,4.8655,4.2994,2.7058,1.0217]}
{"id":1771,"ended":false,"length":460,"text":"Invasive species are those that cause harm in their newly occupied area, where biological control may be attempted. The first @ - @ detected invasive mole cricket species was Neoscapteriscus didactylus, a new species from the Philippines. Neoscapteriscus didactylus has an extensive native range and is widespread in Taiwan and southern Yunnan (Cui et al. 2013).\n\nIn spite of the widespread distribution of Neoscapteriscus didactylus, we do not yet know its full distribution and biology in Taiwan. In this study, we collected 20 individuals of this mole cricket from forest and agricultural lands in Taiwan, and determined its phylogenetic relatedness as part of a comprehensive phylogenetic investigation (Wang and Zhang 2008; Wang 2009; Liu et al. 2011).\n\nDescription\n\nThe male mole cricket is similar to Neoscapteriscus atriceps ( Cui et al. 2013 ), except that the first antennal segment in the male is 2\/3 longer than in the female. The head is rounded and the prothorax is flattened. The elytron is strongly curved in dorsal view. Eurystomax is short and rounded. The eyes are well placed. Both elytron segments have a curved surface and the first segment bears a pair of spurs. The male has two distinct spurs (male 2, male 5 ).\n\nThe female mole cricket is smaller than the male one. It has a flattened body shape and is somewhat lighter in color. Its elytron bears a pair of spurs, too, but it has only one spur at the front (female 3). The eyes are well placed.\n\nBoth species are arboreal. The call is provided by the male at the end of the first elytron segment.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe range of Neoscapteriscus didactylus can be found in Taiwan, Japan and the Philippines. We found this species on various places in Taiwan, but it still needs to be surveyed more.\n\nBiology and ecology\n\nThe species has not been studied in Taiwan yet. Only one record has been published on this mole cricket (Wang 2009), but we suspect that the abundance of this species in Taiwan would be similar to that in mainland China. The substrate preferred by Neoscapteriscus didactylus can be varied according to distribution. In agricultural lands, the species has been reported to prefer artificial substrate or soil and prefers shade areas (O\u2019Donnell et al. 2012). The species can be collected by using traps or attractants (Cui et al. 2013).\n\nKeywords : Neoscapteriscus didactylus, Taiwan, mole cricket","token_len":563,"entropy":[11.5435,2.4993,2.0893,6.1751,0.7433,3.4348,3.8776,3.1996,3.7132,11.6197,7.1216,6.3572,1.2805,4.3742,7.8755,3.7633,4.0168,0.6378,6.6518,0.9998,2.6181,4.4891,13.946,8.9427,6.4715,10.4867,5.9837,11.7574,10.6532,3.5139,1.6371,9.5868,7.0058,8.012,9.8224,0.5088,9.7935,5.3077,5.9216,0.7551,1.9918,2.0215,4.6003,1.3929,3.4118,1.4479,5.5945,0.7613,3.7232,0.1161,0.0154,0.0144,0.0035,5.4382,0.0072,0.0132,0.0024,2.781,3.2378,4.3706,6.3539,0.9209,1.8988,1.3608,5.3644,0.7153,7.3482,1.14,4.1801,7.3786,0.0006,4.8315,4.842,4.5997,1.341,0.0019,1.3893,3.0647,0.39,3.2822,0.0007,2.9012,7.4595,0.009,1.0913,3.9276,3.9569,0.4577,1.5397,0.114,0.009,0.0258,0.0024,3.9767,0.0062,0.0029,0.0025,1.0863,3.7826,2.9068,0.0654,3.4562,0.5038,2.4338,4.8998,4.3904,2.2709,6.156,2.3215,2.3698,0.4679,2.8519,2.7547,0.8303,0.4059,0.1726,4.4053,5.4386,3.8171,1.5885,2.7422,9.2179,0.1113,2.8158,7.1727,2.8631,4.628,3.2124,0.9018,1.8166,1.8817,1.712,4.8533,1.0442,5.1719,0.2834,9.9534,0.0188,5.7917,4.7802,0.001,1.2924,3.0628,2.533,0.1724,4.4919,2.88,4.4819,0.8464,2.5906,4.389,3.2329,1.8023,2.5788,4.7522,1.512,4.1077,1.1436,0.0009,0.0035,1.819,0.3103,2.4715,0.0002,7.5171,0.6778,0.0002,1.9613,6.9661,3.1299,0.0722,1.265,5.5569,0.5905,3.2546,0.656,0.0156,0.0342,0.001,5.8602,17.1404,4.1169,1.7998,8.7234,5.5585,0.1596,0.0011,0.0268,0.3933,2.1833,2.7081,0.8277,1.4415,5.1646,6.6231,0.2357,0.074,3.5385,4.5209,0.5125,2.6142,1.226,6.1814,5.5764,0.3169,3.4397,0.9545,1.9421,0.6884,0.3094,1.0223,0.9103,4.4003,1.0371,5.1686,1.153,1.2507,8.668,3.7434,0.6223,0.4247,0.7373,4.8466,1.1927,0.5922,6.5281,4.1194,4.1846,3.2925,1.1168,5.9456,3.3683,2.8365,5.6729,1.2916,1.72,5.9665,6.4655,3.6626,2.6751,5.5027,1.4603,4.9839,0.9638,5.4807,1.6519,0.7919,5.4718,0.2437,5.5219,5.5089,2.6168,4.2583,4.1364,1.1654,0.03,0.3778,3.7348,2.1035,1.6825,5.926,3.5694,1.7492,2.5033,4.6254,2.7441,6.5446,0.7613,4.7411,0.024,5.1828,4.9716,1.5412,0.6866,4.698,2.5395,2.2059,4.8267,4.0785,0.9554,3.3666,6.308,5.8945,2.6658,1.3976,3.0823,6.4297,2.2247,0.0002,1.2358,2.5208,0.6011,0.0409,1.0945,4.32,0.7322,0.4276,0.1491,4.7912,1.2471,2.3242,0.598,0.9858,4.1186,2.4817,4.5264,1.3047,1.959,4.8639,5.3909,1.4581,1.1191,0.968,2.7771,3.3432,0.3667,0.0169,0.0085,6.5632,0.8578,0.581,0.0037,0.7138,0.0064,2.4541,7.3349,1.6633,1.9501,2.4797,1.1565,2.9845,0.8735,6.2192,3.6268,0.4171,2.9842,2.3917,3.3776,2.1679,0.7956,0.8615,4.2034,0.4024,2.2692,0.704,1.015,3.2888,0.0002,4.4871,3.8643,1.4589,7.514,0.4121,0.0522,2.1581,1.1275,11.6195,3.285,7.0731,0.1646,1.3664,2.0654,4.7491,2.6503,3.4949,0.1134,0.7598,2.7005,4.2887,0.1915,0.0128,0.003,1.1819,1.0443,3.0157,0.0002,5.1563,0.0157,0.3915,0.0002,1.0245,6.0008,0.3353,1.0619,0.0639,0.0031,0.0082,0.0017,0.3309,0.0199,0.0041,0.0018,4.6775,0.181,1.7361,0.586,1.8857,1.0894,5.4145,2.2126,2.2247,0.824,0.7729,3.8835,2.3273,3.8468,0.4269,3.1814,6.2611,6.2884,1.0078,1.005,1.0119,2.2546,2.6067,6.9366,4.4443,0.6924,0.156,4.3276,4.6322,2.6687,1.3819,0.0002,5.2133,0.5089,1.9217,2.8375,0.177,0.0002,1.3654,2.998,2.3896,5.2701,0.5919,2.1621,0.8345,2.502,3.9313,0.6887,5.1709,2.2241,8.0407,2.485,0.0618,2.398,2.1665,1.9367,4.6051,0.0141,1.7809,2.1665,0.0169,2.3795,2.0669,1.2331,1.9025,3.3975,0.5093,1.6186,7.0708,0.4554,2.2417,0.6069,1.9201,0.6476,3.8775,0.882,2.808,0.1847,0.7752,1.2838,3.6064,0.3423,0.716,2.0339,9.5059,10.524,0.7937,2.3238,0.0438,0.0045,0.0039,0.0012,0.4269,0.0022,0.0031,0.0017,4.0675,0.5657,6.5936,4.118,0.0042,8.1767,1.4246,2.7646,7.319,1.6898,0.775,1.634,3.1461,2.1353,0.8195,2.8244,0.6545,5.0724,7.8653,5.5552,3.9174,4.2749,3.6989,5.7202,7.1057,6.5907,2.9216,5.248,13.0483,6.4655,11.2083,1.0984,0.0025,0.0295,2.3238,0.5101,2.5704,2.4839,2.5895,1.235,4.4461,2.8478,3.5838,6.3041,1.5934,9.1374,1.1295,1.7391,3.1945,0.4537,0.0818,0.0008,0.003,0.1612,0.4409,0.8185,0.0002,9.3844,1.0626,4.8826,1.2057,0.0653,0.006,0.0055,0.0024,0.6183,0.0055,0.0027,0.004,0.4487,5.4784,0.3753,9.601,0.0154]}
{"id":1805,"ended":true,"length":493,"text":"One of the earliest accounts of Waterfall Gully comes from a `` Mr Kent `` who, along with Captain Collet Barker and Barker's servant, Miles, climbed Mount Lofty in 1831.\n\nThe book `A Collection of Australian Mountaineering, ` written by Colonel F. Mackellar (the first of the `` Mountaineers of Australia `) states :\n\n``In the vicinity of Mt. Augustus, Mr. Kent and his servant climbed up a tree which they got to by a series of waterfalls, and, from thence, descended into a deep gully, up which they ascended on foot and reached Mount Augustus, but were forced to turn back because of the steepness of the declivity `.\n\nThe authorship of these accounts and perhaps the exact sequence of events is as not clear.\n\nThe waterfalls at Waterfall Gully come about 200m above Mount Augustus and are part of the range of waterfalls which form Waterfall Peak on the eastern side of Mount Augustus. It takes some imagination to identify which of the many waterfalls in the gully falls on which side of Mt Augustus the authors describe.\n\nThe route described by Kent and Barker goes down and to the north east. At the head of Waterfall Peak a waterfall may be seen where it is joined by a larger cascade which flows south east towards the top of the gully.\n\nAt the head of the gully the smaller falls drop 100m into a large and deep gully which is part of the range of waterfalls which make up Waterfall Peak. The lower ends of the gully become progressively steeper and narrower, until they end a few hundredm below the top near the saddle.\n\nThe authors were probably trying to climb the gully from the north east. They say they descended by first climbing a tree, so perhaps they climbed down the left bank from Waterfall Peak as the river descends to the west, then up and over the saddle and down the opposite bank.\n\nThe gully described by Collet Barker is different. He and his companion climbed to the top of the gully by a route that went straight down the centre which drops into a large shallow glen at the base.\n\nClimbing the left side of the glen requires some scrambling. There are a few pools of running water where an extra protection would be appreciated. The stream is quite swift at this level, flowing over sandstone debris and boulders left by the long dry seasons and snow of recent years.\n\nThe route in the middle of the gully is easy enough and leads to the top of the gully in good time. The upper ends which the authors described are very steep and so would probably be difficult to climb.","token_len":563,"entropy":[2.8006,0.4101,5.5339,5.9248,0.5345,9.4802,3.403,7.7442,3.483,4.6461,0.0997,1.6953,12.5735,13.7817,10.6609,4.2527,1.86,2.8337,4.8531,0.0086,6.2462,6.951,7.3945,9.6647,2.596,10.4188,0.6758,7.2525,0.8297,8.8138,2.322,7.103,5.299,7.6299,1.9496,2.0635,2.7566,4.3428,1.0042,3.7814,0.3293,1.9582,4.8156,7.4962,4.0896,5.6319,0.0708,7.9989,4.9441,1.813,0.6329,4.0891,6.6654,4.8903,0.4255,3.8344,5.8869,0.6821,6.2087,7.7023,2.8412,3.5216,4.6442,2.6958,3.3677,1.4682,4.9118,5.6851,0.4858,0.1045,1.4875,1.3066,3.131,2.0527,4.0814,4.918,0.8245,0.0002,0.9218,3.8886,1.4787,5.2641,0.0299,3.996,0.3614,11.5961,1.1613,5.3352,0.9381,3.0023,2.3026,1.0625,2.3718,4.83,2.5696,1.5743,4.6808,3.0661,3.3335,6.2478,2.9719,5.946,3.4861,5.6797,0.0051,6.3938,0.1851,1.8314,1.8059,3.3591,4.4224,2.4751,0.7594,4.5042,2.0736,1.1983,3.0271,5.4957,0.0412,1.4446,6.5338,0.7177,1.0022,4.438,3.92,1.6613,2.2046,4.7087,2.8835,3.2624,1.4991,5.568,2.8102,3.7662,0.4419,4.0459,0.4142,3.8074,0.5283,0.7504,4.6334,0.22,0.3172,0.1647,12.1888,1.0809,10.2089,3.7687,1.3947,0.0003,2.4635,5.2399,5.3899,0.2093,3.6694,0.7495,4.1091,7.3916,1.3159,5.6075,4.6384,0.2815,0.8297,2.091,5.0626,7.3589,2.4384,3.1576,1.8678,0.0002,1.8468,5.2421,0.7405,3.7345,5.9483,0.0024,0.2215,0.0012,5.8585,3.708,7.3581,4.6879,1.3205,3.962,0.5583,2.8457,1.8925,5.754,0.0167,0.7982,5.4232,0.5366,4.6025,0.1674,3.0511,3.6984,8.5687,0.046,5.9549,3.8319,0.5621,3.9431,1.3099,0.04,2.1323,1.1129,0.5043,3.5384,5.399,3.3503,6.5536,0.0963,6.3575,4.6689,1.3011,1.3345,4.2449,1.2349,0.0081,3.4986,0.6642,6.248,0.0325,6.1565,2.9856,2.9753,10.8016,1.1757,3.8215,5.5613,1.9033,5.3102,5.5584,1.2087,0.7763,0.0002,1.5035,6.959,5.1514,1.0081,5.8123,1.1377,0.3998,4.2487,2.8447,4.2818,3.8366,1.1845,2.9181,5.523,3.1344,3.522,0.9347,4.3297,0.0344,4.8112,0.0019,1.9976,3.6185,5.2872,4.7784,0.577,0.336,5.9236,2.4772,1.6288,6.9707,0.8479,0.7775,5.514,5.9573,2.4703,3.5409,3.3234,4.263,4.4002,1.0835,4.1648,0.2226,1.3203,1.8503,0.0044,0.4389,1.2098,0.0002,3.6761,0.9839,2.7431,0.027,1.544,2.1546,0.0037,2.9323,7.0948,4.1456,5.8031,8.4231,0.3166,3.0572,2.1857,3.3166,5.2041,3.5825,1.4817,0.025,1.2839,1.3211,4.2807,0.0048,0.2598,0.7461,0.0955,0.2042,0.0107,0.6626,5.3384,0.2235,0.4897,0.0006,0.1617,0.6049,1.8084,4.6677,6.6926,0.1093,0.4273,1.0634,0.0346,5.6688,4.3096,6.4064,0.001,0.9929,4.3915,2.3678,3.3396,1.5328,4.927,5.8563,3.1858,1.4014,1.4555,1.7049,0.6136,2.3604,9.7947,0.5424,6.3686,1.0049,0.9838,0.0002,1.2891,3.6406,5.3812,5.0811,3.944,0.0303,7.323,1.7209,1.985,0.0037,3.3128,1.0131,3.3917,3.3737,2.4341,2.6723,3.626,2.8743,4.6389,3.3521,7.3126,2.8725,2.4334,3.4792,2.3357,6.5429,4.6763,1.2029,2.8782,4.2642,1.9062,5.6203,3.7462,3.7088,4.7554,0.0013,0.9112,5.2292,2.2317,3.9694,5.7108,0.0041,2.6778,0.5294,2.2387,2.3053,1.7429,4.1226,3.2255,2.708,0.7845,3.5191,2.1124,3.177,1.0226,5.1303,0.3759,1.5394,0.7713,0.0002,1.3716,3.3487,0.0296,6.1248,0.7872,4.9141,0.0448,0.3403,1.533,7.2829,2.1516,2.4538,4.8514,0.8505,2.563,2.2032,3.7205,0.5928,0.9555,0.5124,0.9968,0.6651,0.0036,2.6261,2.3157,6.4709,2.9272,4.4289,3.4872,1.0077,1.4417,4.8814,6.3702,6.0513,2.6303,0.9473,1.9086,5.3637,6.89,1.2245,4.5489,0.3809,2.4279,2.2559,1.2097,0.0002,5.935,3.0533,0.216,2.6486,4.9234,3.1328,0.1835,0.3969,2.9763,0.0018,5.7722,3.2082,6.1796,1.5396,3.6221,1.0881,2.8021,1.2555,7.1914,1.6853,8.0324,0.0386,4.6338,5.484,6.3147,8.3371,5.3125,0.4933,5.9769,0.6452,1.9738,5.1434,2.1222,4.2275,7.232,4.2551,1.9864,3.8907,1.4711,6.1957,3.8206,7.3354,1.8352,7.0499,1.5077,3.6158,0.0144,7.9462,1.4961,1.1113,5.9721,6.1329,4.7713,3.111,5.3124,5.5113,6.8602,0.94,0.1263,0.6884,0.0002,1.186,5.5924,4.9099,1.4089,3.01,0.3062,0.5745,1.4325,0.0095,1.2051,5.3198,3.4865,2.8598,5.3284,1.4685,1.1846,2.8807,0.3102,0.8885,1.4737,0.0115,3.9815,5.5536,3.7646,0.4207,1.5121,5.1932,3.0278,7.5704,4.5694,0.8221,2.9247,1.2154,3.4985,1.4491,0.7819,5.2019,4.7847,3.6623,1.1569,2.715,0.3815,1.0833,1.2878]}
{"id":2087,"ended":true,"length":484,"text":"The novel is set in 1830, at the tail end of the initial campaign to secure Latin America's independence from Spain. Most of Spanish America had gained independence by this date ; however, not all the Spanish possessions had. Colombia, in the mountainous north of present-day Venezuela, was the last to do so. Once that was achieved, however, the focus quickly shifted to the \" North America of the Caribbean \" \u2014 namely Cuba and the Dominican Republic.\n\nIn the summer of 1830, a small group of Spaniards, in the pay of powerful Colombian interests, and led by a former officer of the Spanish Army, Juan Jos\u00e9 C\u00f3rdoba Mart\u00ednez de la Torre, set out on horseback to secure the town of Boquer\u00f3n. Once there, as luck would have it, Spanish forces occupied the town, giving them a base from which to launch their campaign to unify the territories of Colombia in the north of the country under Spain's rule.\n\nIn August 1830, Mart\u00ednez de la Torre landed with about 100 soldiers at the Bol\u00edvar River, west of the town of Ibagu\u00e9, Colombia. A series of skirmishes followed and, by late November 1830, he managed to defeat local militias and capture Ibagu\u00e9. Soon after, he headed north to attempt to capture Boquer\u00f3n, but his main opponent, Colonel Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz de la Portilla, successfully held him off.\n\nThe Battle of Boquer\u00f3n (aka La Batalla de Boquer\u00f3n ) was fought on January 2, 1831, on the northern coastal plain at Boquer\u00f3n, in present-day Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. It was one of the early battles of the Colombia War of Independence and, by the evening of January 3, D\u00edaz de la Portilla had been mortally wounded. As a result, Mart\u00ednez de la Torre marched on Bogot\u00e1, the center of the insurgency.\n\nHowever, on January 5, Mart\u00ednez de la Torre was captured by the city's defenders and, later that day, surrendered to the local government. Mart\u00ednez de la Torre was imprisoned in a fortress outside Bogot\u00e1, but, while his captors were busy negotiating a surrender, he escaped and, on March 21, was shot to death.\n\nAt least 1,600 men took part at the Battle of Boquer\u00f3n. Most were Colombian soldiers ; however, an estimated 40 or 50 of them were native troops from the nearby Wao Valley. The battle also included several hundred European soldiers, including men from the British East India Company. According to D.J.

{"id":4908,"ended":true,"length":460,"text":"Fatty acids, or fatty acid residues when they are part of a lipid, are a diverse group of molecules synthesized by chain @ - @ elongation of an acetyl @ - @ CoA residue. [ 9 ] As shown in FIG. 11B, a chain lengthening reaction, the methyl transfer @ - @ acetyl cycle, is an important first-step in the biosynthesis of fatty acids. The methyl group (M) transfers @ - @ the hydroxyl group of the CoA residue (1) to the alpha-carbon (2), [ 94 ] generating the methyl-CoA molecule and the new acetyllysine (2' ) as two separate products. The chain elongation reaction takes place in the cell nucleoli, where acetyl-CoA is produced as a result of cleavage of the methyl-CoA at the acetyl-CoA methyltransferase (EC 2.7.1.2), producing acetyl-CoA (3) ( FIG. 11B ). At this point, the newly produced acetyllysine can further undergo a transfer cycle to produce various fatty acids including myristoleic, or palmitoleic acid, linoleic, or arachidonic acid, and palmitoyl-CoA. [ 9 94 ] Myristoleic acid and linoleic acid are saturated fatty acids, while arachidonic acid contains a double bond at the carbon 9 position.\n\nThe fatty acids are involved in lipid transport ( Fig. 11C ), as well as many of the other processes carried out by the cell. The primary function of both free- & bound-fatty acids is to form the backbone of lipoprotein particles, and the fatty acids can assume the roles of structural protein components of the membrane such as phospholipid membranes, lipid bilayers, ion-conducting membranes, and as components in the phospholipase membrane. [ 9 94 ]\n\nThe fatty acids of humans come from both the diet and the cell wall. However, the diet plays a much more important role, as is shown by the fat content in the tissue of humans. Humans generally have about 15% (grams\/litre) of fatty acids in the tissue. [ 94 ] However, animals in the same species often have only trace amounts of fat in the tissue.\n\nIt is usually necessary to test the cholesterol levels of the fatty acid, because the fatty acids are formed by a different pathway than the cholesterol biosynthesis. Since cholesterol is part of the body's cholesterol synthesis, one might be able to compare the cholesterol levels in the body with the fat or cholesterol levels in the various fatty acids, which will reveal any problems with cholesterols (see below).","token_len":564,"entropy":[7.9588,8.22,1.8811,4.6991,3.5782,2.3349,6.6694,7.3082,2.8617,0.6657,6.2892,0.0221,2.0381,3.7821,3.4456,1.7526,3.9216,7.4133,1.044,0.1531,2.0599,8.1624,0.0709,1.022,11.4938,16.0076,5.9809,7.3435,10.7246,0.6923,2.4383,4.0885,6.0127,0.3919,13.4646,1.1051,3.9161,8.6808,2.6173,6.5293,0.7564,6.0304,6.4469,0.4078,4.2119,3.042,0.2705,3.6335,0.2532,4.3156,3.9909,1.7557,2.4075,2.0794,10.6869,0.7557,4.1208,3.6938,3.7892,6.4597,7.3437,7.2476,0.9919,0.4641,4.974,0.0187,7.76,0.8662,1.173,3.7889,2.5455,5.7224,4.7768,2.1248,2.122,0.8225,5.704,0.1734,0.0976,1.8858,0.1382,0.774,1.8328,1.1232,6.0325,3.8403,3.1651,1.9994,7.3318,8.5377,0.363,0.2196,4.8693,5.6298,0.2315,0.0423,0.835,1.5296,1.1996,6.6534,0.0616,1.6348,2.4769,4.7793,1.929,1.3108,0.8341,7.7042,1.3114,5.8288,3.3055,1.3174,2.5435,6.6493,8.7503,0.3373,8.1431,1.1339,2.4712,3.4178,1.9778,0.0624,4.6994,3.3103,0.9107,7.593,5.4022,6.3262,4.8049,5.6279,2.4682,1.7171,4.2819,9.2763,4.6973,3.6285,6.2463,4.5346,6.639,1.0806,1.0677,4.5207,2.8278,0.0584,0.8488,4.1777,0.3826,1.5841,1.1758,4.7341,6.8157,7.6434,2.027,1.15,3.9379,0.0236,2.8579,0.1028,0.0099,1.1129,4.0344,2.7035,1.1433,3.9498,0.0208,5.8475,0.0598,0.3762,0.832,2.3305,1.862,0.0405,0.0036,5.707,0.8034,2.7167,0.0097,1.2976,0.2463,0.0058,4.7198,1.6176,1.1912,1.7437,6.5415,5.8642,4.0982,3.3682,0.8825,1.4838,1.8138,2.0195,3.0179,6.1574,2.6973,0.07,0.609,0.0476,0.0141,2.6728,2.0581,1.0537,3.1215,4.3538,0.1356,0.5244,1.1224,0.4782,4.0484,1.6218,0.956,0.3898,0.7535,6.4845,3.9311,2.0525,0.0837,0.0792,0.0169,0.0074,4.2246,6.3909,5.1799,2.3563,5.1559,5.9426,1.9739,4.7338,7.746,2.1133,0.0777,3.6826,6.7333,0.3029,9.939,3.6682,4.9821,6.2575,3.8364,0.0039,2.207,0.0223,3.09,1.0046,5.9841,0.1075,0.0046,0.5203,2.2739,4.1691,0.7116,0.0165,0.018,1.8882,2.0648,1.8436,5.974,0.0021,1.9968,0.0546,1.3139,0.3619,0.0219,1.8001,2.1868,3.2547,6.7865,0.0571,8.6606,0.0116,0.2003,0.0254,0.4608,2.864,1.8801,0.002,0.0049,0.16,0.6857,7.1603,0.8563,0.0221,1.6394,2.2325,0.6689,0.002,0.0092,0.0215,0.0946,4.9402,2.7148,5.11,1.7609,3.6953,0.866,5.1986,7.0784,5.463,1.4895,3.3225,0.0003,1.5627,2.8381,0.7247,1.8329,7.2676,0.0802,5.8943,3.9423,3.5145,5.5928,0.0326,0.715,1.1373,2.0332,3.1078,1.6147,0.0054,6.7833,3.1183,0.2012,2.3108,2.2001,6.3279,0.0596,0.4903,0.7457,2.3074,0.8044,1.6062,5.3884,4.0349,0.0874,6.3799,7.0351,5.1594,10.2104,6.154,0.9082,4.6285,0.0183,0.0584,0.4069,0.5048,2.9549,2.6839,4.6448,0.2164,5.2863,2.0669,1.3562,4.1503,1.6003,1.9921,2.0772,2.2983,0.3315,2.7372,9.3762,1.3168,2.699,0.3074,7.07,5.46,4.8421,3.5146,1.0295,4.2181,5.4173,0.0217,4.0911,0.3557,0.0007,1.9777,3.1569,0.8275,2.9081,1.6377,1.2679,0.1546,7.8504,4.6632,3.9972,1.2251,2.4341,0.1938,0.8134,5.6558,5.5614,2.8315,0.9357,4.7714,0.4593,0.0015,2.5479,6.4921,0.7704,2.8542,1.7033,0.5313,0.0167,2.9459,0.0002,1.3899,1.8794,0.2907,4.6495,8.1451,6.094,0.5006,4.4828,1.8759,3.9974,0.3585,0.8975,4.3907,7.2407,1.0198,4.4236,0.0249,1.6065,3.2502,5.7276,0.6473,2.9603,1.3663,0.3058,0.0323,4.1084,0.8792,3.9847,0.9815,1.5863,0.4478,7.0184,2.3006,2.5047,1.0863,5.3205,0.9425,3.1945,1.0534,5.26,5.0884,1.4464,3.972,3.9714,0.3203,4.4345,9.9721,0.7438,2.4971,6.0203,0.0202,0.0628,0.1495,2.9852,0.1527,1.1821,1.5771,4.2731,2.5657,2.0442,2.1418,0.0907,3.1959,0.0187,6.4672,3.908,1.5262,3.9224,2.4265,4.3432,0.6408,3.9727,8.7571,0.0489,0.6381,3.5754,1.4743,1.2185,2.0957,0.8217,3.6725,0.0002,4.5452,0.7006,6.0776,3.5169,0.3518,5.8361,1.1043,5.6323,3.1641,0.7745,1.5356,4.0115,2.2439,4.1431,3.6768,1.7778,2.7853,0.4998,1.3045,4.9479,1.4772,2.8039,5.1966,3.0815,1.6378,1.1999,1.1003,4.7581,0.4874,1.5639,5.3076,1.7311,0.747,6.4453,0.0043,0.2749,3.7965,0.2992,2.5708,2.5351,1.1499,4.7627,3.3445,3.5786,1.5693,0.0105,5.5841,0.6202,1.0363,0.7501,2.6077,1.1783,2.4681,1.1322,1.2195,6.5396,4.9672,0.98,1.6307,0.4139,0.2985,7.5734,3.3028,0.076,2.8734,2.5048,4.6131,4.9288,6.4054,6.0208,1.3636,7.5981,0.5639,1.805,3.4388,2.7496,2.4948,0.4248]}

{"id":3177,"ended":true,"length":469,"text":"Vollmer unveiled Close Castles in June 2014. Players start in corners of a `` grid map `` and are represented by castles. Vollmer explained that the game's name is from castles built by the Norse on the British Isles.\n\nIn addition to the usual gameplay features, the game supports two-player, online multiplayer sessions where players can explore castles, battle, and trade with their friends. Close Castles features a strong RPG element with the player character gaining experience and level up as well as acquiring skills.\n\nClose Castles, the browser-based medieval multiplayer strategy game by developer Vollmer and publisher Gambitious, makes its debut today. The game's Steam page also launched today.\n\nIn addition to the usual gameplay features, the game supports two-player, online multiplayer sessions where players can explore castles, battle, and trade with their friends. Close Castles features a strong RPG element with the player character gaining experience and level up as well as acquiring skills.\n\nThe game is available in Early Access now through Steam, with a full launch planned later in 2016. For more information and to sign up for the newsletter, visit the game's official website.\n\nThe game is available to play in its Early Access phase on the Steam store\n\nDeveloper:\n\nVollmer\n\nPublisher:\n\nGambitious\n\nGenres:\n\nStrategy, Sandbox\n\nRelease Date:\n\nNot Announced\n\nPlatform(s):\n\nSteam\n\nThe developer behind Close Castles wants to make something for players of the browser game Age of Pirates.\n\nAoP is a free-to-play MMO game (as opposed to the free-to-play browser game by the same name), and the developer says that it will be offering a \u201csimilar experience\u201d to players of AoP when the browser version goes under a major update.\n\nAoP \u201cis like Close Castles, but with less micro\u201d developer said, and it also features naval combat. It\u2019s currently in Closed Beta, and players can register their interest for access on the official website.\n\nThe developer is targeting an early-2016 release, though it seems that it might actually be a bit further behind. However, Vollmer was confident that the \u201cgameplay loop\u201d was going well.\n\nIf you\u2019ve always loved strategy games, and want something that plays a bit more like a MOBA or ARTS, then Close Castles may appeal to you in a way that AoP might not. That\u2019s been my initial impression, anyway \u2013 I\u2019m looking forward to the next few updates to see just how much the developers have put into the game.","token_len":565,"entropy":[8.9317,3.6638,10.647,13.9945,10.9702,1.8185,2.1675,4.4468,2.6905,1.1314,9.1528,4.8991,3.0826,10.0131,3.313,2.8958,13.9681,13.2405,5.6161,2.7851,1.8551,3.2171,5.9323,0.2971,8.8181,1.4841,7.8339,0.0818,0.0036,4.3245,0.7527,1.537,2.4039,2.9042,5.9355,1.7343,4.9911,9.0402,4.3823,1.2487,1.8916,5.3437,6.0419,1.1697,7.0383,0.0446,0.7321,1.7948,0.0034,3.101,3.4779,0.3016,1.389,5.6675,5.2052,2.5451,0.5113,1.7059,0.8179,4.0588,3.4842,4.0875,0.1538,4.2731,2.466,0.8263,6.9071,4.7752,0.6197,0.798,4.7158,3.9646,1.6815,3.7218,2.9272,0.8235,4.8357,1.008,3.5549,0.6264,0.5087,5.6882,0.0271,0.0004,2.6484,1.4078,5.939,5.3083,1.7771,2.5551,3.5382,3.1188,3.2343,4.1181,1.3853,1.8702,4.8726,0.7198,2.3122,4.1306,0.0763,4.4666,3.5598,1.5128,1.317,0.0002,2.6914,0.019,0.0003,4.4793,2.6638,8.7347,0.6814,0.2486,7.3283,5.961,4.0731,0.3127,3.3675,5.1755,3.9391,0.0073,0.0013,3.2499,2.1085,5.0618,3.8368,0.4021,5.7308,2.4719,0.5814,2.8716,2.0561,1.7448,0.6406,2.9183,5.4162,2.0394,4.674,6.788,1.8209,1.3274,0.7504,0.0002,3.762,2.1885,0.1251,1.094,4.2793,1.0652,0.0116,0.0395,0.2054,0.0101,0.0146,0.0064,0.0007,0.0031,0.0004,0.0023,0.0043,0.0005,0.001,0.0005,0.0038,0.0043,0.0013,0.0067,0.0067,0.0042,0.0005,0.0031,0.0055,0.0008,0.0024,0.0037,0.3156,0.0042,0.0002,0.2491,0.0021,0.0029,0.0012,0.0045,0.0015,0.0013,0.0053,0.0007,0.0025,0.0004,0.0012,0.0003,0.0005,0.0006,0.0038,0.0007,0.0114,0.005,0.001,1.2667,0.0001,2.212,1.0625,1.7388,1.2103,2.1541,5.0192,0.0107,4.1269,3.7295,1.42,2.5065,3.2961,1.744,4.3903,3.7941,2.965,4.1336,3.0553,2.3433,0.1603,4.0127,0.2604,0.1801,3.4219,0.7432,2.8079,0.1045,0.3714,1.1964,7.5223,0.2463,0.7539,1.6675,2.6481,0.0923,1.8514,0.6979,0.4708,0.9388,0.0002,3.1412,0.9065,1.0531,0.8365,3.8253,2.0725,1.48,4.5191,1.3758,0.0053,3.3986,2.3239,3.2091,1.3498,1.1415,6.7467,0.0002,6.6752,0.6368,5.3321,0.0002,0.7257,0.0112,0.0009,0.8954,0.0002,0.1542,0.0271,0.1304,0.0001,0.4503,0.0091,0.222,0.0001,5.0265,3.2713,0.0223,0.5999,0.0003,4.2933,0.0114,2.257,11.1898,0.1419,1.2997,0.0002,2.5718,0.4097,0.0054,0.2522,0.0002,7.1265,9.899,0.0061,0.5747,0.0002,3.555,3.4306,0.0043,0.432,0.8797,0.0003,1.2586,0.9465,0.0002,4.6565,4.8032,1.1364,0.7789,0.0609,0.0002,6.2011,0.3389,1.7238,5.3966,3.8177,4.1725,3.1942,3.9113,6.0374,3.532,7.9143,0.0232,8.5965,1.2415,1.9705,0.0002,4.3012,9.5949,3.8117,2.341,0.8045,2.6271,0.9781,0.1023,0.0014,0.0161,3.6253,2.4955,5.876,3.8837,0.9445,0.0012,2.7147,3.0762,0.1174,0.0088,0.001,0.0355,6.9434,1.4213,6.6724,3.308,1.2076,0.0784,2.2572,2.9738,2.5808,3.0566,3.3805,1.5015,1.2437,2.0948,1.2255,6.2641,1.6335,15.9708,8.0494,8.7194,2.1387,4.2189,8.0508,0.7873,5.5553,1.0958,7.1955,0.2999,5.4295,2.7449,4.1131,1.1215,2.8799,8.765,3.8262,4.0778,0.4271,0.3822,0.6045,0.0002,2.3056,0.0537,0.0013,11.7994,0.1716,2.7369,6.121,7.0815,0.1779,0.0004,1.264,0.7171,1.5879,4.555,8.3147,18.4925,3.7276,10.7955,8.8928,3.3978,2.4145,2.915,4.0591,2.1406,9.8036,1.3037,1.6643,2.8525,11.6294,7.9075,2.8108,5.3563,1.9914,5.6086,0.1234,1.577,1.2077,5.1243,1.0317,5.2809,2.0924,2.3764,3.5481,4.8843,3.1964,0.7101,2.7106,2.5281,0.5629,0.3732,0.0002,1.9696,2.5675,2.6944,6.0813,2.958,1.6277,3.7131,2.4941,0.5602,2.362,3.7523,1.6216,3.3659,0.9836,1.8365,2.8627,5.4562,0.5533,2.4743,2.2124,6.0612,4.4068,1.6002,4.9211,0.0906,5.2768,0.0061,0.0007,5.5133,4.6184,0.4938,1.5213,11.5377,0.322,3.3323,7.1723,9.567,0.6877,2.9572,3.3989,3.748,2.3492,1.4809,0.337,0.0002,4.8985,0.6811,5.9967,3.7224,1.5982,6.1364,3.4733,7.716,0.3333,0.6671,2.5216,2.9207,4.6506,1.5723,5.4016,3.5443,3.1225,1.645,0.5465,2.0749,5.5867,0.0025,3.3373,6.0506,7.2173,0.6559,1.0627,2.6396,0.0177,0.0001,3.3686,5.7654,0.4224,0.0326,4.7454,1.2999,1.65,0.6455,7.0444,0.0144,4.6749,0.1133,0.2078,5.1462,3.9004,0.7426,0.5778,6.1449,3.7245,4.5336,2.5416,1.9155,8.3183,6.7067,2.5215,3.1829,0.824,1.2371,2.7454,0.1681,0.0105,2.3326,3.1102,3.4417,3.4952,2.3547,5.0546,5.3676,0.1797,2.5142,2.8257,4.8262,1.6413,3.4527,0.5906,1.3074,0.2685,0.3695]}
{"id":633,"ended":true,"length":471,"text":"After the Virginia Tech kickoff and a short return, Miami began the first drive of the game at its 32 @ - @ yard line. The game's first play was an incomplete pass that was recovered by the Hokies. They drove down the field into Miami territory, before the Hurricanes stopped the Hokies on 4th and 6 @ their 27-yard line. #HokiesFB\n\nOn the Miami ensuing drive, a 12-play 70-yard drive ended on the Virginia Tech 33-yard line @ - @, but the Hurricanes were unable to capitalize into points and punted on fourth down. The play of Miami's punt team was impressive as the Hurricanes only allowed the Hokies to return 5 of their 9 punts for 13 yards and 1.\n\nThe Hokies opened their next drive with an 86-yard kickoff return that was followed by a 33-yard pass to the Miami 32-yard line.

{"id":344,"ended":true,"length":526,"text":"In her review of the audiobook for Strange Horizons, Siobhan Carroll called the story `` gripping `` and found the listening experience evocative of Orson Welles's famous radio narration of The War of the Worlds [link].\n\nI'm sure she'll be pleased to see her opinion echoed by such a prestigious, well-respected publication as SF Site magazine, whose reviewers are usually very well qualified. (But SF Site also notes that Orson Welles had never recorded a science fiction play. And Orson Welles wasn't even a good narrator, and I happen to be a fan of his.)\n\nI've never gotten involved with any live performance theater, but I'm always fascinated to see the way the audience receives material that's presented to them as a play and isn't in the form of a film or television broadcast. So I'm very fond of the Strange Horizons discussion about this recording of The War of the Worlds.\n\nOf course, as a science fiction fan, the appeal is obvious -- but in this case, it's also intriguing to compare the reactions of the audience at the radio broadcast with the audience at the original Broadway stage performance. Not surprisingly, there were only a few similarities. Both audiences were extremely excited and anxious when the sounds of chaos erupting from Mars reached earth. But both also had the same reaction when actor Orson Welles delivered the lines \"Martians!,\" as in: \"Martians! On this planet? It can't be!!!\" -- both audience members gasped and turned away in horror.\n\nWhat I also find interesting is that most everyone who took part in the Strange Horizons discussion of both the audiobook and the Broadway performance commented on the fact that Welles simply would not have gotten by with the same amount of time and money that Tom Hanks was able to afford for his movie version.\n\nWelles was an ambitious, talented actor, but his dramatic reading of War of the Worlds would have sounded like nothing but a radio play if he\u2019d been making the same budget as Tom Hanks. I suppose we can\u2019t know if any of the plot details of the Hanks film are altered in the movie version which hasn\u2019t yet been released, but even if it\u2019s the case, you\u2019ve got to think that Welles would have been required to change plenty of things from his own script.\n\nIf you have a chance to listen to this, I'd definitely recommend it. In spite of an often-clumsy narration, you can't help but be in a state of suspense every step of the way. And even if you've already seen Tom Hanks' movie, I think you'll be glad you took the chance to see the play (or the audiobook).","token_len":566,"entropy":[6.3789,5.5133,0.6986,0.9444,9.8343,0.153,4.7323,8.9434,1.2761,0.3375,9.0794,2.0401,0.01,7.0217,4.8577,1.0025,3.3462,11.2046,14.9561,7.42,0.7117,6.7002,1.8613,8.4004,0.5201,7.8457,0.0479,0.4632,8.8372,0.0931,0.3498,0.0,0.7988,5.2717,7.9713,4.4458,1.6309,3.021,5.4694,0.5633,0.4193,0.0102,7.5632,8.2174,1.2423,1.9317,0.0252,4.6487,3.135,2.5556,3.5431,2.9356,1.5618,3.2258,0.6551,2.5684,3.5114,8.0718,3.1448,0.8999,6.9378,2.688,5.817,3.8603,2.6282,0.2042,0.888,4.8247,1.1285,5.3311,11.618,6.2092,1.5942,3.9029,4.5085,2.2035,4.3523,3.298,4.0355,4.9065,1.5282,4.6355,4.7288,8.6972,0.8886,2.8803,4.7441,0.2782,4.8483,0.0043,1.3188,0.0002,3.7125,5.2976,5.7998,1.0209,7.0952,0.2614,6.4279,3.4728,2.6969,5.3353,0.001,0.9151,0.0003,5.0235,0.0008,1.6313,1.7749,5.5877,3.1803,1.9059,3.1682,3.1599,8.14,0.0004,3.2494,1.6454,1.8917,0.3855,1.6841,1.1999,0.5413,0.0003,2.9102,2.709,3.3063,5.5455,4.4485,1.0066,2.5458,9.031,4.3069,6.4937,2.0325,1.5252,0.7249,2.4819,4.5477,3.6301,3.2685,1.4439,2.4409,3.724,1.8603,2.8475,7.6521,5.6219,2.4977,2.7182,4.2368,3.1923,0.1815,2.5279,2.0258,4.533,4.0099,6.6321,0.0003,4.3442,2.1174,4.0751,0.2163,0.9669,3.6815,1.8068,1.8556,4.7526,0.2492,3.6639,0.9981,1.6851,3.6048,5.2199,0.0054,1.3024,7.8351,0.0023,7.0245,3.2889,3.5409,6.3676,2.8852,4.9886,0.139,0.0252,0.0157,0.0036,1.1084,0.8162,0.0002,5.1179,0.1824,0.2141,4.0698,2.2146,5.1097,0.0516,2.3521,0.4449,3.5909,6.4203,3.2822,2.3831,4.308,3.3686,4.4938,2.3325,0.1722,0.4737,1.7396,0.7769,2.511,6.0818,2.4615,5.3375,1.0925,6.0279,0.4259,1.1005,0.6593,4.0489,0.8773,7.2324,3.1696,1.9805,1.1198,3.8633,0.5507,0.3998,6.2623,6.5408,6.473,4.906,0.4752,5.8938,2.6213,0.0299,3.0651,1.9184,5.245,1.6791,0.5351,9.1115,1.6061,5.348,1.4928,1.1017,5.372,2.8181,2.5045,6.3899,3.0148,1.1113,7.8648,0.7143,8.2882,6.3453,1.8611,1.1933,7.1024,5.4816,5.751,0.8751,2.9309,3.8496,4.6021,2.2737,2.9029,1.6704,2.9635,1.2669,10.4427,5.3828,0.0054,0.0221,0.0001,4.8293,1.1942,5.0674,3.1192,8.2697,1.156,4.7266,7.6567,3.3855,4.6884,4.2045,1.1642,3.1205,0.0397,0.7875,5.8594,3.5175,0.8765,5.974,4.3034,5.0553,0.5025,0.4774,7.9304,0.9947,4.6641,4.8868,7.3399,1.4447,7.3862,1.7188,4.2835,2.4201,2.7088,2.1551,0.4459,0.5622,0.0002,4.2465,2.883,4.3606,1.7261,1.1865,0.5405,0.6664,5.2141,7.5116,2.502,4.4234,0.292,0.3338,0.27,3.1984,0.0002,2.4186,5.1486,7.7789,1.785,5.8053,0.0072,0.1402,0.6147,2.4934,0.7985,7.2102,0.6124,0.723,3.5684,0.0331,3.7566,0.0005,6.5124,6.746,0.5656,0.9639,4.4217,7.2414,2.1716,1.365,4.6534,3.2669,0.005,3.7005,1.8697,2.1642,2.8849,7.0051,2.1867,0.0666,3.4814,3.0349,0.0038,4.3802,3.3915,0.8431,3.6716,4.8246,1.6017,1.584,0.0002,3.74,0.0128,2.1908,3.5739,5.8423,1.9994,3.2727,1.6659,1.4336,1.9697,2.1266,6.6552,8.2277,1.0145,8.0884,0.1904,0.0132,0.0066,4.094,0.7294,6.2676,2.0134,5.0224,3.1046,0.9531,7.8951,2.5602,5.6091,1.0516,18.306,6.5985,3.5775,1.6474,5.2352,2.6551,1.5275,5.9904,1.227,2.8303,0.1125,0.0013,0.8913,3.8353,5.1674,3.5548,1.4752,10.6148,0.6682,0.4719,4.6565,2.7585,5.5828,0.6733,1.5977,6.8274,3.1904,1.4923,0.905,8.1845,0.0572,2.7433,2.1617,7.9592,1.7409,0.9957,3.9544,1.5599,7.9519,7.0889,3.9301,0.6174,0.4575,3.289,0.2439,1.7731,2.4074,0.6079,4.8472,0.8466,1.8956,2.545,0.0023,0.498,2.794,1.8471,0.316,4.9287,2.6909,0.2362,3.1976,1.7846,0.4857,3.1777,0.9493,2.2495,0.0004,2.2914,0.185,1.1448,7.8372,0.1367,5.9241,9.3302,0.1557,2.0216,4.3621,1.7398,4.0808,1.6626,1.38,0.5044,0.0003,4.034,1.4444,3.192,1.8192,4.4982,0.4412,2.4592,0.1324,2.8238,4.2813,1.8954,1.8936,5.029,0.2433,1.4475,0.7509,4.7803,5.7012,0.0034,5.8282,5.5016,1.5717,5.6616,3.516,4.1583,0.8855,4.5405,1.1783,3.2918,1.1523,0.1027,2.8159,5.1694,3.1803,2.3717,0.0152,5.3085,5.2697,5.1352,0.0194,0.0318,0.0011,0.4596,2.2727,3.1306,0.5654,0.573,3.8891,2.967,2.4841,4.4625,0.0999,0.0018,1.3328,1.8489,1.4478,2.5619,2.2412,0.7971,1.3954,2.0032,2.7212,1.0277,4.0984,0.7459,3.0199,0.56,3.0767,1.5365,4.2442,5.6194,2.0251,3.0899,3.2854,0.0005,1.9246]}

{"id":4672,"ended":false,"length":532,"text":"In 2009, he was one of the most highly regarded walk @ - @ ons in the nation, and emerged from a group of Michigan football players who referred to themselves as ``G-Men.'' The next season, he struggled through a broken thumb to play in 11 games, and started the last seven against Boston College, Northwestern, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, OhioState and Missouri, helping the Wolverines to an 11-2 record. He was named Third Team All-Big Ten after helping Michigan capture second place in the conference standings, and set a school record for tackles with 108, while also picking off two passes and breaking up seven others.\n\nGholston also participated in the Senior Bowl, Senior Bowl Week, NFL combine, and participated in Michigan's pro day workouts as he considered his options. He then announced he would be giving up his final season of college eligibility to enter the 2011 NFL Draft. Gholston's final decision was heavily influenced by his grandfather John, who passed away on December 27, 2010. In his pre-draft profile, he was projected to be a first round pick by various draft experts, and was ranked 21st or 22nd on their boards, some even putting him in the top ten. In the 2011 Draft, Gholston unexpectedly fell to where the New Orleans Saints were drafting, 31st overall in the second round. Gholston was the first player from the state of Michigan drafted since defensive lineman Chris Spielman was drafted 2nd overall in 1990 by the Cleveland Browns.\n\nIn his professional career, Gholston has remained very inconsistent with injuries and was often on the practice squad for the Saints, who released him on September 5, 2016.\n\n\"He has always been the quiet, steady and consistent player in the locker-room who plays with high energy and passion,\" Michigan head coach Brady Hoke told The Wolverine. \"He is a leader in the room and can really run. He is explosive and is going to help our defense with what he can do.\"\n\nOn December 17, 2014, just weeks after Michigan lost to Ohio State in the Big Ten title game, Gholston announced in the locker room after the team's victory over Illinois that he would be transferring to South Florida, a move that surprised Hoke at the time.\n\n\"What surprised me was he came in and was like 'I'm going to go to South Florida.' I was like, 'Wow, well, that is an impact player.' [His move was] going to be huge for us,\" Hoke said. \"I don't know how you replace that. We recruited some guys, but how do you replace that? In every position, he impacts that.

{"id":1424,"ended":false,"length":425,"text":"Berg is located in the borough of Nordre Aker, northeast of the residential area Ullev\u00e5l Hageby, northwest of Voldsl\u00f8kka, west of T\u00e5sen, south of Nordberg and east of Sogn. The neighborhood takes its name from the berg, an old fortification that was located in the island V\u00f8yen, opposite the southern border of the Voldsl\u00f8kka area.\n\nBerg is an area that was originally built up with homes, villas and public buildings from the late 1940s to the 1960s. Today Berg, like Nordre Aker in general, is a popular area because of the new and well-maintained housing stock and the good schools.\n\nThe area has a large green patch with the Voldsl\u00f8kka and \u00d8yestad streets to the east and west. The neighborhood is part of the Sognsfjorden borough of Trondheim.\n\nThe population of the area was 7,835 in the 2019 Norwegian census.\n\nCharacterized by public buildings, there are large schools, such as Sveinung Stoltz School, located on the corner of \u00d8ystad and Haldnes Streets. The Sveinung Stoltz Library, with its unique library card system, is one of the city's major attractions\n\nBerg as well as Nordre Aker are located in T\u00e5sen, the cultural center of the borough. The major event in T\u00e5sen and Berg is the annual T\u00e5sen Folk Festival, which is held in September each year.\n\nHistory\nBerg is one of the historic borough that consists of both northern districts of the old Voldsl\u00f8kka and northern T\u00e5sen. In the early 1970s, the district experienced a shift in the demographics of the area and most of the residents of Nordre Aker migrated to the area.\n\nAt the end of the 1940s, the area was planned and began to be gradually constructed of new townhouses for the workers who were relocated to T\u00e5sen from Nordre Aker. At the same time there is an area of \u200b\u200babout 1,500 new houses built in the Voldsl\u00f8kka area between Haldnes Street and the Trondheimsfjord.\n\nThe new residences were located on the northern slopes of the hill Voldsl\u00f8kka. The old village of Voldsl\u00f8kka, consisting of only a few houses, was completely obliterated.\n\nToday, Berg is an excellent residential area in a good location close to the city and the train.\n\nToday, Berg houses a large selection of educational establishments, making it an excellent place to raise children.\n\nSee also\nBerg Library","token_len":575,"entropy":[9.8635,4.3825,7.3915,0.9274,1.4059,8.2455,0.1227,9.245,6.9241,9.6269,6.047,1.336,6.1592,0.0249,1.8978,9.453,1.3192,13.3963,4.6118,4.8537,2.8013,7.4958,6.5318,6.5918,1.8337,6.8826,0.0187,4.652,6.4152,9.0642,4.0021,3.97,6.4855,1.6196,4.1201,0.0267,5.0027,4.7842,7.3478,1.9771,2.4999,0.0547,5.473,5.3502,2.0291,1.8292,0.0067,4.2728,7.1394,1.895,1.959,4.3903,8.0063,1.5415,0.0164,0.0204,0.5485,7.9368,0.9186,3.2148,3.7713,2.2965,6.4666,1.8199,2.2347,1.1904,4.4442,1.3002,0.4703,7.625,8.4725,4.9538,3.8862,5.712,2.1996,6.6008,0.7463,5.2408,2.7994,0.3558,1.2975,4.7566,1.684,0.5461,0.0479,0.1173,0.1272,3.8332,0.3955,1.2572,0.0043,3.5821,0.1107,0.9955,3.6529,2.2051,2.5285,2.604,3.6062,3.7511,5.7164,4.8295,7.7104,2.0502,6.2357,0.0206,0.4218,5.2221,1.0139,4.4318,0.7057,3.0081,6.0957,0.1225,1.3911,0.4241,3.03,0.0006,0.4636,3.4858,3.9706,4.7319,3.2127,4.7439,1.2178,0.1914,0.0065,4.631,3.4144,0.1884,0.4571,1.4507,3.8773,4.1368,5.4891,0.6579,1.7026,6.5908,4.0931,4.8507,0.3708,3.0222,0.0098,0.0051,3.7246,3.7811,1.9835,0.9364,5.448,4.1141,1.7701,1.466,0.0003,2.0186,2.8257,2.1094,1.5637,2.5634,6.2082,5.5615,2.269,3.1131,4.3414,0.9521,0.0945,0.0091,0.0218,0.0214,3.6627,5.0013,1.4061,3.0101,6.7138,5.8805,4.0179,4.9121,0.3178,1.5803,1.161,3.5041,0.9499,1.2848,3.3228,0.8984,4.8214,0.0101,0.6318,5.0825,3.4899,10.9606,1.8839,0.3941,2.3829,5.0343,2.8502,5.6125,0.5502,0.1286,1.3089,0.7664,0.0003,1.9237,6.0933,0.8074,1.1916,0.9396,2.7638,4.726,0.6695,3.3204,4.1158,0.51,2.9604,11.5796,9.5564,0.2912,0.8119,1.3657,0.0003,9.8625,6.2544,0.1106,6.8149,2.7282,1.1221,5.7281,0.4698,4.6291,5.38,0.7492,6.8422,0.0019,4.6299,5.6929,1.9261,7.3428,5.0043,7.2047,2.8168,4.393,0.9445,6.0882,1.6946,0.675,3.9541,0.0211,3.4295,0.0491,0.4806,8.7518,1.187,3.5141,5.4405,8.6088,6.389,0.8573,1.4262,3.8196,0.9839,0.0235,0.0347,0.461,0.0082,0.0018,8.0107,2.2501,4.7473,0.8402,5.1015,3.319,6.3473,2.7966,0.329,0.7094,3.5852,0.0394,0.1757,4.0953,0.0326,4.6644,1.6001,6.3412,0.0003,2.6236,0.117,5.5136,3.6449,0.0503,3.5657,0.1311,0.0701,0.0048,1.7385,1.2233,0.8452,5.6398,1.4886,0.1217,0.9604,3.4718,9.2881,0.6633,0.1839,0.7471,4.3826,0.7791,1.4382,6.2389,7.3513,2.1048,4.768,0.1024,0.0123,4.2029,6.2973,0.4876,0.3856,2.7394,4.6116,1.1779,0.7246,5.3541,0.3033,1.0485,0.7607,1.5533,0.7226,1.7093,4.0689,3.0069,0.0087,0.5302,1.1029,0.0002,5.1683,0.9699,19.0134,0.0103,1.3521,3.2894,0.0033,0.3716,7.2072,5.061,7.5281,5.9093,0.0905,4.7338,6.178,7.2425,0.8558,1.0928,4.7843,2.9887,0.3312,0.1324,0.0143,0.0109,0.0159,1.7204,2.7229,5.5118,1.4824,0.2371,1.9932,3.0747,1.1554,1.9937,3.3706,0.0645,0.4547,1.0017,3.2913,5.3885,0.9369,7.0354,0.8909,1.6044,4.0258,0.4813,0.6148,2.161,2.5357,6.4748,0.742,0.2918,1.4436,2.4328,4.3989,0.1038,0.0238,0.0029,2.8401,0.5601,0.5464,1.7368,0.6088,1.6187,0.0003,4.603,0.4104,2.1021,0.0018,0.3994,3.5579,0.0329,0.3234,0.8992,2.354,0.8597,9.0667,3.0176,6.0903,0.3452,2.0316,5.1368,5.8456,6.2503,3.8155,5.2179,0.5102,4.6823,0.9904,7.014,2.8011,2.1118,5.9852,0.8158,3.9557,0.1454,0.075,2.8375,3.8098,0.2102,0.0649,0.0033,0.4889,4.1467,0.5272,1.3406,0.0021,4.424,5.4105,2.4868,3.6422,1.1817,9.463,2.3926,7.7195,2.7883,0.4232,1.7839,4.6802,2.1258,1.8324,1.5779,0.5302,4.7161,0.154,0.0323,0.0064,0.0028,0.0137,0.5793,3.8815,4.4941,1.5913,0.3571,1.7483,0.1504,2.5557,6.5336,0.0321,0.1685,11.8766,0.0136,0.0068,7.1403,0.7621,0.0002,1.5297,3.8402,5.8012,1.8303,2.8873,1.4187,0.6309,4.6159,5.3202,0.0858,0.4635,1.9745,5.9521,0.9033,0.3331,0.028,0.0216,0.0216,1.6285,1.3584,4.4741,4.7584,1.7935,1.7322,0.611,0.0606,0.0135,0.0141,0.0109,2.4776,6.151,0.1392,4.4725,2.2217,0.691,1.064,0.6039,0.841,4.4586,6.7161,0.0008,3.0066,1.3476,0.0003,3.6173,0.6175,3.4269,0.4716,3.0039,3.7891,4.5976,0.9545,2.5085,3.7091,3.711,2.769,6.6419,0.0227,0.5285,2.3447,3.2997,1.9261,6.4236,4.8653,1.1465,0.0003,5.7435,0.5612,2.2682,5.4278,2.3575,1.2723,6.3742,0.0069,7.1819,2.727,1.401,7.5259,0.2871,1.8394,1.2243,1.4212,0.3912,5.9643,1.0681,0.8125,0.7163,0.0002,5.9731,0.8807,0.9947,18.4249,0.0745,6.9755]}
{"id":2851,"ended":true,"length":532,"text":"A complex number is an expression of the form < formula >, where x and y are real numbers, and i is the so @ - @ called imaginary unit, a number which takes on the same value as itself when multiplied by 1\/i. Complex numbers can, therefore, be defined as any number expressed as a complex product of real-valued functions.\n\nComplex numbers are an important part of the mathematical concept of quadratic equations, and we often solve for them directly. However, if we wish to define these functions and make them our inputs into a numerical program, then we must resort to some type of arithmetic operation. The following equation will give us a way of computing the square root of a complex number.\n\n1 < x < \u2212 2\n\nWe can now turn to computing the root of the first part of the equation, as a way of proving that we have a solution to the first part of the equation, which is itself a root.\n\n2 < x < 1\/2\n\nTo do so, let us begin with finding the square root of negative 2. As before, we use the complex form, or imaginary part, < formula >. Then, for some real value r, let the function :\n\n$$ r : ( \u2212 2 \u2212 x) \u2192 x\n\n$$\n\nIn this case, we have an equation with an unknown value:. Our final solution is the complex value, \\quad \\{ \\frac{x}{2}\\}. Using the above equations, this value is also equal to the reciprocal of the square root of negative 2.\n\nSince both \\[ (\u2212\\frac{2}{2}) = [\u2212]^{2} \\quad \\] are known and, we can replace both with this value, \\quad \\{ \\frac{\u2212{2}{2} \\quad \\{ \\frac{2}{2} \\quad \\} \\}.\\quad \\]\n\nThis solution of the equation can be verified by plugging it into the second equation above. Substituting the square root value into the second equation, we get\n\n1 < x < \u2212 3\n\nSince, we can also find the cube root. Like the square root, the cube root will be 2.\n\n3 < x < 1\/3\n\nIn either case, when x is negative 1, the complex part of the number will be positive, because. So a negative root is determined by an irrational number and an imaginary number. This may not come as news to algebra students, but it does serve to demonstrate that even irrational numbers can have complex square roots or cube roots. To find the rational number which yields a negative root, use the formula ( ) \/ (- ) \u2265 1\/2. When a root is irrational, it is called transcendental.","token_len":576,"entropy":[9.3565,5.2745,3.3927,3.715,3.6796,0.9919,1.1152,5.4606,5.5935,11.8998,1.7976,4.4443,0.6376,6.0194,3.6654,0.0577,0.2994,6.8123,0.3454,1.7261,0.9233,6.2038,0.6301,0.644,9.6472,14.9243,7.0068,6.4371,10.2686,8.0822,7.1786,2.7618,4.8237,3.0224,2.5321,4.3938,4.1057,0.8238,3.6658,3.8027,0.3951,6.8803,3.7967,2.9981,0.3872,3.9893,3.8888,3.323,0.7746,6.9614,0.2598,2.0489,5.6462,3.3954,0.0061,0.4166,3.8435,0.726,4.3784,0.8371,5.2317,1.1741,1.0085,2.3545,5.9377,1.1198,4.5646,5.8387,0.0472,5.1381,1.0534,1.3965,0.0043,5.5958,0.0086,0.9941,1.0912,5.0773,2.8489,1.9951,0.01,2.0623,2.7287,4.8591,0.093,6.5257,0.0361,0.0354,1.8998,1.3023,2.0386,4.6868,3.953,7.7917,2.1655,1.1576,5.2169,1.3814,2.5246,0.0344,3.642,0.8489,4.2256,0.0451,4.3147,4.7594,2.3583,4.4806,5.3024,0.6266,6.6217,6.9482,3.4447,1.6173,6.3582,2.8923,0.2386,1.9623,0.624,1.0759,6.7785,0.0327,3.4972,4.8439,0.0127,4.4784,4.4668,1.3585,2.5611,2.5956,5.1555,3.1913,2.565,0.844,1.3623,3.8918,1.6792,3.897,1.131,4.1063,0.0747,0.0578,1.5373,0.8831,0.1136,1.3778,0.5327,0.0002,3.7947,5.0825,2.0482,1.5311,8.3141,2.8459,3.2685,0.0003,3.6645,1.1677,2.8374,5.0415,1.2904,5.0705,0.4769,5.7273,0.1574,2.2274,4.8541,4.8042,0.0955,0.598,1.252,1.9833,3.4997,3.4886,3.7718,0.2723,4.5424,0.3886,2.0325,1.6306,2.0469,3.1764,1.0503,0.5309,1.3953,0.6628,0.3735,0.1769,0.3429,2.3176,2.6463,0.696,6.2791,0.6783,7.6249,1.1926,0.9837,0.0001,2.6706,0.4233,0.8383,0.2963,2.8628,2.682,0.6968,0.6245,0.0003,3.9569,3.8369,2.048,0.2685,3.103,0.9509,5.13,1.6421,6.8825,0.5854,3.3345,0.0714,0.0912,9.9066,3.9827,1.153,4.396,4.6956,0.0861,0.6241,3.7872,0.7053,6.1874,4.9617,3.3483,4.2343,5.1065,5.1332,0.9444,6.8466,1.8975,0.5405,1.6066,3.6563,1.2731,4.0417,5.416,2.0625,3.3566,8.1549,0.8058,3.1287,3.4554,3.981,7.4863,1.2833,0.0002,6.7008,2.4129,5.9091,2.6627,6.0437,1.5484,3.8355,3.9325,2.8859,5.718,3.1206,1.9447,0.0003,3.0752,3.4189,0.0002,5.6217,1.2359,0.7435,0.2069,1.3034,1.8735,3.9526,1.6484,2.5778,2.985,6.7937,2.0176,2.7333,9.3655,5.9919,4.9115,1.8418,0.9913,2.6285,4.0441,3.691,2.7605,4.9098,5.8729,1.7379,3.7474,3.4879,2.4985,0.3588,1.788,0.1511,1.2744,2.1105,2.8447,5.3948,0.9006,3.6795,3.403,0.3663,5.5401,4.3231,1.0433,4.5028,4.6976,0.0237,0.7726,6.1908,0.2817,1.1195,2.6499,0.0188,0.296,2.8105,0.1541,0.5812,0.9586,0.0002,4.3611,5.6651,4.3712,4.327,11.0275,5.2698,1.6735,0.0695,2.5059,0.6693,1.0282,1.3234,2.0561,5.284,3.7895,3.3369,4.3274,1.3436,1.1726,2.1495,3.3489,0.793,3.7905,4.7411,4.0998,4.6413,4.1435,5.7368,1.2793,7.5908,4.0984,1.7085,4.8289,1.8751,1.4403,2.4622,1.4683,0.5296,0.1854,0.8383,0.1148,0.0416,5.8789,4.469,0.9341,0.1489,0.0551,0.8636,1.2198,1.106,0.4844,2.2542,1.8364,0.2605,0.0254,1.3611,0.0199,0.1582,0.6382,0.822,0.5424,0.3289,2.7761,1.2482,4.6487,6.5235,4.1294,1.1432,0.9401,1.5973,0.0002,2.8744,3.4633,3.5081,0.9881,0.8552,3.1489,0.4363,4.3315,0.9798,7.055,0.001,2.2797,0.2953,1.2985,5.9325,1.8383,4.0584,0.8157,8.3704,0.2663,0.0039,0.9788,3.4147,0.038,6.7853,4.0574,0.6551,3.3233,0.2376,1.6957,0.7557,1.4519,1.7482,0.0002,4.3264,1.3722,0.5824,0.1254,1.1419,3.2726,0.1858,0.0003,3.9982,3.6016,2.2134,1.9403,2.6453,2.6345,0.4362,6.8925,0.5366,5.0262,7.7194,0.8599,1.9596,0.0271,0.9722,1.5053,1.6148,0.0832,3.712,0.6537,5.5513,1.4089,1.4912,0.0001,2.5994,0.0368,0.1332,0.0207,0.9307,0.1004,1.2987,0.0717,0.0002,3.2768,6.5278,0.1609,0.0513,5.8449,6.0794,0.5082,3.1485,3.0763,0.743,1.7508,5.1891,4.2424,1.4006,0.2285,6.4662,1.5078,0.2724,3.738,2.7422,4.0034,6.2205,4.7427,5.801,4.4642,4.8724,1.8316,5.6406,0.2129,5.1293,4.4589,0.6214,4.0955,3.9085,2.9179,1.6937,0.6086,3.2726,5.2003,3.1845,7.1498,0.4421,6.8245,0.2242,7.3921,2.4869,0.4311,0.4698,1.1696,2.6211,5.1172,1.398,2.7508,0.8051,4.4432,5.8607,0.1355,0.9254,2.3313,2.2726,8.0306,0.0902,6.3016,6.8247,0.0465,0.3096,4.8045,2.9032,0.6194,5.574,1.341,4.5546,4.9433,1.4889,4.0223,0.7582,0.5297,4.0258,0.5067,3.098,3.9166,6.0172,4.9835,6.5915,4.0161,7.5597,1.5173,1.3622,2.158,1.0544,4.9034,3.5289,4.9302,0.6318,4.7083,0.3171,1.684,1.0219,3.0783,9.3119,0.3865,0.9743]}
{"id":4724,"ended":true,"length":518,"text":"In December 1980, Stein was signed as a free agent by the Texas Rangers. Stein made his Rangers debut on April 14, 1981, against the Cleveland Indians. In that game, Stein pitched six innings, giving up four runs (three earned) on six hits, before the bullpen blew the lead, and the Rangers lost 6\u20134 in 11 innings, giving Cleveland their first win of the season. Stein picked up his first win on May 30, 1981, against the Kansas City Royals at home. Stein then pitched in 18 games in 1981, with a 5.18 ERA and three wins, and five holds.\n\nOn September 20, 1981, Stein started the game against the St. Louis Cardinals, but got only five outs, as the Cardinals won 2\u20130 in 12 innings. With his ERA at 4.00, Stein was optioned back to the minors on September 25, before being called back up on September 29. Stein made his last appearance in the majors on October 3, 1981, in relief against the New York Yankees. The game started with the Rangers down 2\u20130 in the first inning, before Stein pitched seven innings, giving up two runs on only three hits, to help Texas to a 5\u20133 win. His four-seam fastball averaged 87\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km\/h).[1]\n\nIn February 1982, Stein was non-tendered by the Rangers. Stein spent most of the 1982 season with the Triple-A Oklahoma City 89ers. On May 7, 1982, Stein threw his only career no-hitter against the El Paso Diablos at the Del Mar Racetrack in El Paso, Texas. Stein was named the Texas League Pitcher of the Year for 1982. Stein worked in 22 games in the majors with the Kansas City Royals in 1982, but was optioned off to Triple-A to open the season. Stein was assigned to the Triple-A San Antonio Missions. Stein was released by the Royals in early June of the 1982 season, and announced his retirement at age 27. Stein won just 10 games and had a 5.15 ERA in 37 career appearances covering 47 innings. Stein said the Royals cut him because he couldn't throw a two-seam fastball above 88 mph (142 km\/h) any more. He was 5\u201311, and his ERA was 5.15. Although he was traded four times during his major league career, and was in three different organizations, his career record was 5\u201316 [1] and he had an ERA of 5.15. For a player who averaged more than 100 innings pitched per season during his 13 seasons, that is one of the worst records in major league history, which is also ironic that he made the All Star team in 1978. The only pitcher with a worse record was Hall of Shame pitcher Bob Milacki.","token_len":577,"entropy":[8.2777,6.6902,0.19,8.7727,2.8161,7.2046,3.1798,1.0127,2.5529,0.0255,1.0608,0.2846,6.2219,0.1506,0.7005,3.5054,4.6072,1.268,3.5673,0.0347,1.7662,1.9499,3.46,0.1463,1.3997,1.1197,1.9568,0.171,4.1413,0.0281,0.5043,2.728,2.5702,0.1159,0.1066,2.0649,4.551,2.9884,1.7274,1.3271,3.2053,0.1669,2.4633,1.0302,3.307,2.4339,0.0971,0.3997,2.1904,1.9529,0.0147,1.4151,6.8915,3.5003,7.1663,6.0514,2.5807,1.7897,4.6214,2.7586,1.7638,0.4769,3.16,3.3349,5.1755,2.1958,2.7914,4.5234,0.1243,3.3093,4.0124,5.6138,2.6132,0.7735,1.6312,1.073,0.0553,0.3784,0.2109,2.4072,6.9584,0.0309,0.9777,0.6053,1.6598,2.2985,1.3043,3.7364,0.3537,1.4766,0.5797,0.6705,0.1451,3.6278,0.0007,0.0396,4.4989,3.4088,0.5572,2.9668,3.1885,2.0294,2.3909,6.5669,1.0366,1.9521,2.0,0.6185,3.8286,2.0329,2.7128,0.0493,4.6681,0.0077,1.7372,3.9775,3.6689,1.7165,1.7097,5.7025,6.1433,1.0838,1.7072,0.0006,3.7545,2.9856,3.3956,0.0244,1.4344,0.0399,0.7495,4.6463,1.7841,3.6357,1.2538,0.1601,4.0918,0.019,0.0059,0.0569,1.3835,2.9874,5.6216,4.8957,3.6518,2.2643,2.5416,4.323,1.4695,1.7162,2.208,3.217,0.1161,1.3712,2.6739,4.2229,0.0631,0.5132,5.081,2.7673,4.5461,1.7292,1.9249,0.0028,3.1504,0.3108,0.4535,1.9066,6.9446,0.0044,2.8808,0.0953,0.9806,3.2493,2.3242,2.1726,2.3272,0.3622,6.9017,1.8297,4.63,3.1212,3.5417,2.2169,1.2851,1.6655,0.9422,2.3901,3.2387,0.4296,4.4217,1.0162,1.9114,0.7456,1.4884,0.2058,0.9559,2.6926,0.2716,0.6129,0.4298,3.4346,3.042,1.5246,0.1477,2.2989,0.0163,0.4104,0.5735,3.0344,4.0097,3.9045,2.4015,2.5808,1.7472,5.5469,1.2447,0.2144,0.685,1.4922,0.2355,3.1158,0.3115,0.5736,3.1479,2.4878,3.1633,4.2866,0.323,1.1678,0.8849,0.0418,1.5997,0.3276,1.6726,6.1188,1.7257,0.0051,0.8941,4.6916,4.3938,6.2496,3.4731,0.504,2.1086,0.1683,1.5028,0.6311,1.1215,4.6436,5.2279,2.3074,4.3694,0.3712,0.3674,5.0129,5.1561,13.0972,1.2155,2.5438,5.8449,3.3487,3.5834,0.5124,0.0511,6.7216,1.8612,0.1143,0.4283,0.0072,1.9456,3.8767,0.547,0.0622,0.4353,1.6473,10.8385,0.0759,2.3168,0.0224,0.6018,0.0773,1.4078,1.3807,3.3397,4.7498,3.8878,0.005,0.5692,3.8454,0.1526,1.1991,0.425,5.0647,0.0888,0.0002,4.8951,0.0372,14.4129,1.307,1.3903,3.3991,2.0525,3.2413,0.0463,0.7699,0.0422,2.1588,4.3151,2.4547,3.5417,2.8892,3.6716,0.0869,0.3712,0.0004,2.3916,0.195,9.2347,0.0327,9.3203,4.0347,0.0655,4.5825,2.1494,6.5312,2.5477,6.1343,1.804,0.1461,1.753,2.5232,0.0184,0.3127,0.1796,0.5523,2.3639,2.3505,3.2957,1.2786,3.3863,0.3556,1.0263,0.0027,0.0272,0.0028,0.407,2.222,3.0129,1.16,3.3405,5.8002,2.8027,5.7382,0.3039,2.0719,1.4259,5.18,2.631,0.6072,4.3633,0.001,0.7282,2.419,0.9714,0.6431,3.1708,1.6783,4.5391,0.0002,4.6493,3.4648,0.9562,0.0198,0.0002,5.5864,5.8617,0.3246,0.4218,0.4711,2.8224,1.9117,5.2626,0.1101,0.9244,2.9093,0.0126,0.0005,2.7825,1.6596,1.5072,3.7736,3.3514,1.879,4.6406,1.4762,0.2291,1.5269,2.4412,3.4166,4.8067,1.9017,2.0925,3.5455,0.0294,1.0085,0.9768,7.264,0.8278,0.3075,2.7302,1.8525,4.166,0.994,2.9941,4.4862,5.924,4.5035,0.1514,3.6149,3.3768,1.1045,2.7229,0.0141,4.0423,0.0077,0.9316,4.7485,3.5255,2.4306,10.0289,6.6748,4.232,1.1876,3.1649,7.0396,4.1156,3.429,6.2027,0.5699,4.1285,1.0636,4.4414,0.0006,4.2242,2.9663,6.574,0.1322,0.5224,0.6953,0.0885,8.3499,4.5112,1.5089,1.493,5.0385,6.4724,0.0037,0.0023,2.011,7.0376,0.6121,0.6829,1.7956,1.8923,7.6325,2.3643,3.7113,3.3986,2.0635,3.5804,1.7053,0.9431,2.9469,0.0089,3.5863,1.2277,6.8537,0.9647,1.6841,3.5124,6.7576,0.5047,3.1967,1.0437,5.4048,0.0715,0.0389,0.169,4.7211,2.0631,4.9093,5.4402,1.151,2.5985,0.8284,3.0362,2.0586,2.8961,0.837,3.2079,0.3573,3.9445,6.3093,1.4704,1.4236,2.6527,1.824,2.1655,3.4902,0.2419,0.2465,1.5319,0.0054,2.7338,2.0427,6.0191,2.3235,3.077,0.6702,6.9803,3.2267,0.0359,3.4006,0.2028,1.9726,1.7949,0.3715,3.3914,0.1931,6.714,1.1509,1.9073,4.176,1.7114,4.661,1.8786,0.0949,3.3604,1.3453,0.8351,4.4956,0.1498,0.2536,2.8683,3.991,1.0214,3.6574,7.4481,3.6329,1.5015,4.2993,1.3983,2.6237,4.2769,0.422,1.5177,4.2052,0.7378,3.5495,2.7032,3.1233,2.3206,1.3003,3.4802,0.5644,1.1587,5.4151,0.1078,8.7896,1.8717,4.7151,7.3944,6.0435,4.8981,1.6234]}

{"id":1265,"ended":true,"length":515,"text":"USS O 'Brien ( Destroyer No. 51 \/ DD @ - @ 51 ) was laid down by William Cramp and Sons of Philadelphia in September 1913 and launched in July 1914. The destroyer proceeded to the Philadelphia Navy Yard for completion. She was commissioned on 9 December 1916, Comdr. O. S. Luttrell Jr., in command.\n\nService history\n\nWorld War I\n\nO 'Brien was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. For the balance of her career, she patrolled along America's eastern seaboard, and on 6 September 1917 performed escort duty for a convoy and picked up and rescued 25 survivors of torpedoed merchantman. O 'Brien also participated in the bombardment of the French ports of Cherbourg and \u00c9vreux on 28 August 1917 in support of the Allied landings. After briefly making stops at New York City and Guant\u00e1namo, the destroyer proceeded to a British base at Greenock, Scotland, where she remained in reserve for the rest of the war.\n\nInter-War Period\n\nIn December 1917 O 'Briens keel was floated to begin construction of a sister ship. She was commissioned as USS O 'Brien ( Destroyer No. 51 \/ DD 51 ) and was completed the following month. The destroyer remained in the vicinity of New York Harbor, undergoing training for possible future use in the Spanish American War. When war was declared, O 'Brien sailed for San Juan, Puerto Rico, and arrived on 15 July.\n\nFollowing an operational tour along the east coast, O 'Brien returned to San Juan late in October. She departed Puerto Rico early on 21 January 1918 for the Panama Canal Zone and after completing the transfer of contraband material arrived in the United States by the end of the month. She made a brief stop in Boston, Massachusetts, for repairs and alterations and made two more stops in Boston during the spring before being stationed as a training ship at the San Diego Navy Yard. There, she began training men from the west coast on destroyer escort operations.\n\nO 'Brien escorted troop convoys between the United States and the Mexican port of Vera Cruz for four months before sailing for the Panama Canal Zone. In October 1918 she returned to San Diego, where during the last month of her existence she was designated a training vessel.

In 1928, construction was completed on the Tamiami Trail, named because it was the only road spanning between Tampa and Miami. The builders attempted to have the town named \"Sanford\" after Charles D. Latham who funded the road, but they were rebuffed by the town of Waverly, Texas, where the Latham family lived at the time. The town was founded in March 1882, so the builders settled for the name Fort Myers, after Dr. John A. Fort Myers, one of the original town founders and a medical doctor. Dr.\n\nIt makes it one of the best and popular beaches in the world. When the hotel first opened in 1926, the place was known as the \"Grand Hotel of North Ft Myers.\" The hotel was owned by the Bausch family at the time, who operated hotels along the Gulf Coast. After the War of the Pacific, Bausch sold his entire hotel operation to businessman Henry F. Lathrop, who renamed the hotel \" The Lathrop Hotel \". The hotel was closed in 1946, shortly before the Lathrop family sold their entire hotel operation to Bausch Industries and moved to California. In 1968, Bausch Industries attempted to reopen the hotel as a budget motel, but the plans went nowhere. In 1973, the inn was purchased by an investors group headed by George and Janey Schrammel. The hotel was renovated in 1976 as the Holiday Inn...\n\nThe site known as the original \" Fort Myers Beach \" was first settled by European immigrants beginning in the mid 1700's. According to early surveys, the land between a creek and the sea between the two towns of Charlotte Harbor and Fort Myers were the locations of Native American settlements. The island off of Charlotte Harbor was named \" San Carlos \" by the Spanish, but it was referred to as \" Cape San Carlos \" in the early years of American settlement. When the Spanish gave the land to the English, they named the island Fort Charlotte. When the English were unable to defend their claims in England, they sold Fort Charlotte to the United States in 1795.\n\nIn the 1700's, the first fortifications of Fort Myers were built during the Seven Years' War by the French. In 1756, the British seized Fort St. Elmo, Fort Myers, and Fort Myers Bay from French hands. The British built a palisade around Fort Myers and Fort Myers Bay, but the fort was never properly defended against enemy attack after this point.

{"id":3155,"ended":true,"length":508,"text":"On March 15, the US Navy started to monitor an area of disturbed weather, that had developed about 245 km ( 150 mi ) to the northeast of Nadi, Fiji. During the day on March 16, the convective disturbance gradually became better defined into a tropical cyclone, and at 0300 UTC on March 16, the JTWC initiated Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA). A TCFA is issued 24 hours before the formation of a tropical cyclone, and requires at least one system to meet certain criteria, in order for the tropical cyclone to be recognized. Once the JTWC issues a TCFA, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center will also issue a TCFA for the area, even though the system that issued the TCFA has not yet seen any significant wind shear. This will usually be the first instance in which multiple tracking organizations issue a warning for the same tropical cyclone. The system rapidly intensified to a Category 1 hurricane with 1 hour sustained winds of 90 mph (150 km\/h) while moving slowly to the south due to increased wind shear. At 1145 UTC that day, the system crossed the International Dateline or Greenwich Mean Time, and began to track to the north. By 0600 UTC the next day, the system had reached Category 3 intensity with winds estimated at 130 mph ( 215 km\/h), or tropical storm intensity. By 1248 UTC on March 18, the system reached peak intensity with estimated 100 mph (160 km\/h) winds and was located about 435 nm southeast of Honolulu, Hawaii. This made the system the 6th hurricane of the 2014 Pacific typhoon season and the first Category 3 (equivalent to a minimal or major hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale ) cyclone in Hawaii since Hurricane Iniki in September 1992.\n\nAlthough this made it the first Category 3 hurricane to form in Hawaii since 1992, the system had passed just about 400 nm ( 620 mi ) south of Nuku\u2019alofa, Tonga, which at the time was near the cyclone\u2019s closest position to any tropical cyclone. In fact, at that time Typhoon Bopha which was still on its way to becoming an intense super typhoon, was only about 440 nm ( 700 mi ) away in the same island group. After passing just south of Nuku\u2019alofa at 1128 UTC, the system slowly weakened as it passed over open waters. By 0600 UTC on March 19, the tropical cyclone had degenerated into a remnant low in a trough of low pressure extending to the west-southwest of the central North Pacific. About 18 hours later, the system became extratropical and became known as Ex-Tropical Cyclone No. 11S.

Rathnavelu, who collaborated with Sukumar on Arya ( 2004 ) and Jagadam ( 2007 ), was the film's director of photography in his return to Telugu cinema after seven years. The cinematography on the film was handled by Ramon Raja, who had also worked with Sukumar on his earlier Telugu films such as Pokiri ( 2001 ), Kshanam ( 2004 ) and Savyasachi ( 2010 ). Sukumar had said that Rathnavelu got the best ever response for Arya, and that the film would make a very good reference for the cinematographers and that it was one of the best shots in Indian cinema. Sukumar chose only Rathnavelu and had even approached renowned cinematographer Roger Deakins and was turned down because Rathnavelu was already working on a project. The project was a Bollywood project. Rathnavelu was a close friend of the cinematographer of his previous Telugu films such as Shankar and had approached him in 2002 to do a Bollywood film. Shankar turned him down at the time saying he was already doing a film in Bollywood.\n\nThe film's editing was done by Sankalp Reddy.

{"id":2726,"ended":true,"length":563,"text":"As a child, Douglas was very close with her mother after her parents'separation. She witnessed her mother's emotional unraveling that caused her to be institutionalized, and even long after her mother was recovered, Douglas was still deeply affected by her mother's behavior. Douglas recalled the incident at the time, while being interviewed by People magazine. Douglas said she's been in love since \"I was four years old\". I did everything. When someone told me not to play with Barbie because she was too girly, I said \"I don 't care. I'm gonna play with Barbie and I'm gonna play with it all I can \" Douglas's mother, Jean Carroll, had said in her 2010 autobiography My Story that she had suffered from borderline personality. In 1994, as Douglas neared her 30th birthday, she published her autobiography, \"Saving Jean \". In the book, Carroll describes her daughter as \"the most beautiful, talented and loving\" among the children, and that she was always helping other children who were neglected and abused. However, in the same book, Carroll also described Douglas as a brat and a troublemaker, as well as saying that she was \"a great disappointment\" to her and that Carroll had considered her as a \"waste of oxygen\". Carroll was the author behind numerous other books as well, including \" A Woman of No Importance \" in 1968. She died in 2019 at the age of 100 after having become the first woman to grace the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue twice. During an interview, Douglas said she never looked closely at Carroll's mental health at the time of her mother's death, although she did admit that she had been having some problems recently. \"I would have loved to have seen her more. But I had some of my own issues, too, with some of my career choices at that time. If I had had more time, I would like to think that we would have worked through all of this together, but it was difficult,\" Douglas said. Douglas noted that her mother's problems had to do with her divorce, as Carroll later told People magazine in the same interview which aired on 20\/20. \"There was a lot going on in her life at the time. Not only would she have her bouts with depression and things like that, she just wanted to be alone all the time. It was just a difficult time. He told a similar story during a 2003 interview with CNN, and her memoir was reprinted after her death.

{"id":1088,"ended":true,"length":531,"text":"The modern family is commonly thought to have originated in the 1830s : courtship became more open, marriages were often based on affection, and parents devoted more attention to children. At the same time, the industrial revolution was bringing greater freedom and mobility to the poor -- and, sometimes, to the rich, too. But a growing number of researchers have been looking to the ancient world as a potential origin story for the American family.\n\nThe researchers are looking primarily at the cultures of the American Southwest, where much of the country's earliest prehistory resides. There, as far back as 5,300 and 6,000 years ago -- nearly 20,000 and 25,000 years ago, respectively -- hunter-gatherer tribes were the rule, rather than the exception. These bands of nomadic people roamed vast territories, often making treaties to live alongside rival clans. Among them were egalitarian groups of women and men called pueblos.\n\nThese societies had marriage and family life quite different from those that would emerge in North America over a period of 400 years. \"We don't need to look very far to see a contrast with the modern family,\" says anthropologist Nancy A. Levin of the University of Texas at Austin. \"We see much less inter-household marriage than we see today where people tend to marry within their house. We see lots of free men and free women, and we see polygamy.\"\n\nIn these pueblos, children learned their basic skills from their parents, who lived side by side with their kin. But, when they became of age, they would move out into the wider world on their own and live in huts (most constructed of the same materials used in pueblos today) that they were able to establish and maintain by themselves.\n\nThe young people left their parents' huts and made their own villages when they reached the end of their adolescent years. While there, they lived alone for a time, studying different skills and, eventually, learning to make pottery and build houses.\n\nWhen a young man hit his 30s, his first child might come along. Though child rearing would be no different from ancient times, the family would include a couple of wives. These plural marriages were not only socially acceptable, but desirable for the families in times of scarce resources, and the young men were often able to support several wives and their children. In addition, pueblos supported extended households, including those of aunts and cousins, who could be joined by other relatives and their children.\n\nThe extended households kept the family together, so if one partner became too sick or elderly, others were there to step in and help. In the United States today, extended families are rare.\n\n\"There is no more close-knit extended family today than it was 10,000 years ago,\" says Levin.","token_len":581,"entropy":[8.5543,6.1865,1.3792,9.3255,2.8394,1.044,1.4887,3.9236,0.8523,1.4837,7.5948,0.0983,11.9679,9.781,0.8564,4.7222,2.4855,5.7573,2.3261,4.6284,1.4101,3.55,4.2397,0.4493,5.142,0.9381,0.5635,4.5632,7.1684,2.0742,2.5507,0.0613,3.0664,1.3497,5.0506,0.6256,0.7272,0.0022,0.234,1.6916,6.741,0.851,2.6765,3.1042,5.0044,4.3467,1.912,4.2911,0.3909,1.017,3.9467,8.0634,2.1753,3.1126,6.8551,0.1292,1.5299,0.9157,1.8405,2.7281,1.649,0.1113,3.92,4.2001,3.1603,1.2619,0.0662,6.6189,1.5353,3.2897,2.6302,2.6971,0.7722,5.4311,1.666,3.1571,0.6828,3.9475,6.942,4.0778,0.6783,1.3156,4.2997,0.9439,0.4975,1.9575,0.0007,2.3472,4.3404,3.6236,3.3096,6.6968,0.0762,1.2313,5.5985,0.8796,1.2049,4.3014,2.9774,0.8962,2.446,5.4413,0.0742,0.2463,4.1152,1.1097,5.5936,6.3902,2.1108,7.1975,0.3902,5.0177,0.546,5.1253,3.6065,0.1707,0.0014,5.2421,0.1374,3.979,7.305,2.9712,0.0232,0.9236,0.1763,0.0746,4.4042,4.7415,4.4299,0.4468,0.0029,4.6029,3.9184,0.0146,0.0103,0.0885,0.5086,1.3774,0.0063,0.1068,6.5528,0.0838,0.0111,1.2407,2.5164,2.6756,4.1581,7.4739,1.4234,5.1295,0.0065,0.1358,0.0007,0.2998,4.1782,6.8502,1.4623,3.3881,0.251,2.2047,6.5338,0.0017,5.4429,3.8921,0.9965,3.0835,5.0776,5.1856,3.296,4.1456,4.5128,6.6883,3.6109,0.7701,5.3622,1.6879,0.8358,10.1138,3.7158,1.7245,2.8682,1.3914,1.2451,4.7455,5.3906,1.9054,1.2138,1.1174,1.068,0.0002,3.7989,3.1299,3.2032,8.5032,2.0275,1.9106,2.4385,6.4767,0.6066,0.1461,1.3892,3.4171,4.3395,3.3698,0.94,4.7479,0.0685,4.1199,2.8931,1.9978,0.0743,5.5365,2.2637,0.8086,4.246,2.5522,3.0387,0.0005,5.2729,0.5172,1.7297,3.4295,0.3349,1.033,1.4196,2.9611,7.7325,3.2799,1.117,3.6198,2.036,0.4478,0.7543,7.3908,0.0165,6.3371,5.1379,0.4753,7.7669,1.5664,0.7201,0.3527,0.0053,2.7081,0.2826,0.2159,0.4694,1.0445,2.043,3.7055,4.8914,3.0311,4.4406,2.2531,7.9992,0.6732,2.9178,3.0375,0.7034,2.8526,1.3975,7.0048,2.6015,4.6564,0.0826,2.3865,5.7827,1.4648,5.8419,2.1758,2.3943,1.6315,4.6492,0.0941,6.0394,7.3288,1.0892,3.7428,0.02,1.5495,1.147,2.507,0.5106,5.768,1.8608,0.2,0.0002,2.7121,4.3691,5.0614,0.0021,0.1478,0.1994,6.1197,5.4716,4.0316,6.7832,1.354,3.6799,1.0404,1.4497,1.0022,2.3281,4.0108,5.6605,0.086,0.0013,0.7628,1.2969,4.6789,0.5822,3.2361,3.5662,3.2965,1.7999,2.883,7.8185,0.0329,0.1886,1.2862,3.7747,4.7786,2.5043,2.7639,0.6912,6.1812,1.5193,6.2485,0.7857,0.019,3.124,3.3977,1.4881,6.4739,0.1134,5.8952,6.1997,10.2303,0.9801,5.2945,0.624,1.3139,2.1317,1.0598,4.3328,0.0024,0.3068,3.4583,1.5966,2.3644,2.8564,3.5443,4.6366,0.0037,4.4915,3.0721,2.2247,4.8847,1.5885,0.2502,1.4124,0.0002,1.9565,6.2613,2.9578,5.7381,1.4292,3.1595,1.8768,5.3661,0.0081,1.0387,5.0495,0.2433,2.3075,4.9852,6.8382,0.1872,2.7709,1.9268,3.2834,0.0166,0.0843,5.7596,0.0529,0.4085,5.0777,3.0262,2.3965,0.3543,3.1591,4.7588,3.1091,1.2844,1.1289,0.6559,6.6531,6.0158,3.855,1.1179,6.4523,1.3898,0.0036,4.2948,1.0308,3.3632,5.7949,0.2174,1.6808,5.3176,1.6613,0.3362,1.3576,0.0002,4.1424,3.6263,3.2117,1.5488,7.5325,2.6997,3.5786,0.0821,0.4231,1.6691,4.1604,4.7991,5.1214,3.1676,3.023,1.3485,6.053,7.3979,4.7683,0.0157,4.5844,1.3305,5.6634,2.9664,1.0473,7.8749,3.1627,0.1867,1.4464,4.1198,1.4133,6.6868,1.9708,4.4225,0.2826,3.9203,2.2663,3.7056,7.9856,2.7639,1.6158,2.8673,4.2098,5.0739,1.2816,0.587,0.3819,6.7723,2.6743,1.5514,3.7135,2.8588,8.292,0.1346,8.7294,0.6541,1.6279,2.4629,2.6571,3.7312,0.8432,2.3206,2.3223,2.253,0.0047,4.6276,7.3994,1.4019,3.1084,3.2536,0.6192,0.5702,3.6751,2.3859,0.3284,4.4949,0.0074,0.1713,7.086,6.8024,7.2782,1.1677,4.1306,3.2725,1.8964,3.9304,4.6173,0.3978,4.6877,1.2387,1.6146,2.0091,3.0556,5.3559,1.4338,2.945,3.226,2.3635,4.3199,0.6043,0.3163,0.4081,0.0002,1.8657,7.9009,3.3384,6.4131,1.2456,2.4299,0.9325,1.0135,3.7782,4.8994,1.9798,5.3416,3.469,3.6693,3.4421,0.8733,4.9699,0.616,4.7149,3.4482,6.0834,0.2213,6.4125,0.2921,1.3308,1.0172,0.7186,2.7765,2.1025,5.1614,0.0068,1.5963,0.06,5.6538,0.3841,1.4033,4.2737,1.4992,2.2288,0.0002,2.0241,2.7432,1.6421,1.6476,5.212,6.4219,1.7214,0.0276,4.7392,0.1318,3.9868,0.2336,3.4931,0.131,3.4108,0.3469,0.04,0.1378,0.0034,0.2546,0.372,1.2244,0.2024]}
{"id":3784,"ended":true,"length":501,"text":"Mayer was appointed Geschwaderkommodore ( wing commander ) of JG 2 `` Richthofen `` on 1 July 1943, thus succeeding Oberst ( Colonel ) Walter Oesau. Command of III. Gruppe was passed to the replacement on 5 August 1943. On 23 November he was given command of II.\/JG 2, but he failed to gain a foothold in combat. His time out of the fighting was brief since he resumed command of III Gruppe on 24 March 1944. He lost his arm in a parachute training accident on 27 March 1944, and did nothing further in the war.\n\nThis is one of my favourite machines and I enjoy every occasion of flying one whenever I can. It is also my only aircraft of the Luftwaffe built from the ground up as a fighter pilot and was a great learning experience. With all those wings it really handles like you would not think was possible with a jet prop. The speed is phenomenal and the handling is near impossible to explain, but I love it. If you do not understand why I do not have both a Bf109 and a Fw190A3 I would ask myself why that should be.\n\nThe aircraft is a complete and original machine, which was converted and painted for the Waffe (Luftwaffe).\n\nIt has been completely restored within the last year, including a total re-bonding of the undercarriage and complete strip down and rebuild of the engine. All the wiring was replaced with NewComer stuff and a full new cockpit and canopy was installed.\n\nIt is being sold for only $8000.00 US dollars and the seller will ship at buyers expense both ways. (He is a very nice fellow).\n\nThere are no known issues with the aircraft. The seller will include the following:\n\n- Manuals \/ Instructional Videos\n- Owners Workshop Manual\n- Original Luftwaffe Sticker\n- Original Original Flight Kit (This can be shipped free of charge, but the buyer will cover the cost of shipping to his zip code)\n\nAs you can see the price is very reasonable.

{"id":4802,"ended":true,"length":470,"text":"By 1537 the area immediately north of the new colony of Guatemala was being referred to as the Tierra de Guerra ( `` Land of War `` ). Paradoxically, it was simultaneously known as the Pueblo de Hierro (`` Iron Land `` ) because of its iron-rich soil.\n\nThe history of the Inca Empire began in 100 A.D. when their royal Inca father Pachacuti founded an empire stretching from what is now Columbia in South America to Peru and Bolivia in the Andes, and from the Peruvian coast to Quito in Ecuador.\n\nOne by one the other Inca cities were destroyed and the Inca Empire slowly disappeared until it broke up due to internal strife and warfare between the provinces in the central and southern regions of the country. In 1533 the last Inca leader died, ending his line of rule at a place called Cuzco.\n\nThe Incas were probably the first great civilization to be conquered by the Spanish conquerors. The Spanish took over the Incas' cities and built fortresses. The Spanish found gold and silver mines in southern Peru, where the Incas had been, and had begun to spread their rule to the Incan empire. By 1531 there was an Inca colony in what is now Guatemala where Pity Pachacuti was captured and murdered in 1535. The main Spanish forces went into Peru.\n\nIn 1536 the Spanish governor Manuel Pizarro ordered the destruction of the cities of Quito and Cuzco, hoping this could be accomplished by 1538. But the Spanish were defeated by the Incas and the Inca-Mexican wars continued for years.\n\nThe Spanish were finally defeated again at the end of the 16th century, by the Inca-Chilcanos ( also called Chilches ) of Chile. The Incas, weakened by years of war, were defeated at the Battle of Hatupata, Chile's capital. From that time on the Inca empire declined rapidly.\n\nWhen Pizarro heard that the Incas had lost, he decided to come to America himself. On November 10, 1538 he crossed the Andes mountains to where Guatape, the last Inca outpost, was built. Guatape would become the new capital and would be the capital of the New World. Although Pizarro came to Guatape, the Inca king, Atahualpa, was not there, which caused an argument between the Spaniards and the native troops, led by the son of Atahualpa. After some fighting, Atahualpa was killed. Pizarro and several of his crew followed the Inca trail and arrived at Cuzco, the Inca capital. On his way to Cuzco, Pizarro destroyed the town of Quito.","token_len":581,"entropy":[7.6021,5.1526,2.5244,8.5444,7.2742,3.1004,0.072,1.3703,6.5649,5.0928,2.2294,8.7452,0.6925,5.6847,5.6871,0.0999,0.471,1.2791,7.6477,0.2401,2.4968,7.0389,1.5543,2.8732,13.6487,10.1964,0.5556,5.6294,2.0769,1.4558,12.5084,0.0106,0.1467,2.8202,0.9027,8.6999,3.188,0.1493,0.6497,4.9325,0.5848,0.4547,1.1952,8.6889,0.3157,1.3468,2.3539,8.4059,6.0616,0.7717,1.7492,6.4614,0.7685,0.7325,4.8546,3.1993,1.0144,1.3114,2.2864,2.2345,0.1567,1.6238,6.8217,0.0838,0.8202,5.7267,0.7333,1.6107,3.135,0.952,7.572,4.297,0.0,0.0086,0.4355,2.426,6.2896,6.4979,11.1568,0.2505,6.6466,5.5153,3.2847,2.363,4.2545,3.6357,2.9802,0.3787,4.4216,0.4817,5.9575,0.3155,0.1733,8.776,3.161,2.3509,0.476,0.4488,3.2528,1.3675,2.7596,1.9159,0.8671,4.5401,0.0353,2.2086,1.7535,2.4133,1.6539,6.3601,0.0153,3.0733,0.3216,7.9351,0.3165,0.8545,2.845,0.5132,2.5316,0.0003,5.6002,6.569,0.0014,1.661,6.3666,1.2361,0.4483,4.482,1.4269,3.7849,2.5041,1.7206,1.8981,0.3707,1.9183,5.5605,3.4984,5.0274,2.3248,6.9588,1.7812,6.5515,0.0374,5.38,2.0226,1.4768,6.1948,1.2007,0.7146,7.2643,3.3579,0.7541,6.0218,1.3475,0.916,1.7668,0.9517,0.6244,2.0749,0.2308,2.6055,3.8926,4.4194,1.1376,6.4742,0.718,0.0128,6.7893,3.9365,2.0329,7.094,2.595,6.9662,0.1534,5.0526,4.5254,3.0703,3.486,0.3197,4.2028,4.0362,0.1188,1.4854,1.0202,0.0003,1.5706,0.7709,2.145,2.4868,6.305,1.3992,1.3223,6.1146,3.756,0.7111,3.1512,2.7796,0.4236,0.7915,2.7608,5.4479,0.2475,1.3467,1.8045,2.0127,4.904,1.1081,1.2222,2.5738,0.5607,2.3148,5.0198,1.3241,4.4668,4.1975,1.2821,3.8468,1.5828,1.4471,6.2721,7.1419,1.0733,0.7848,2.6656,1.8066,5.0397,0.5866,1.1957,3.4726,2.0232,0.5422,0.1701,3.3808,2.6764,6.1219,0.5668,5.2342,4.0153,1.0004,5.6665,0.6673,6.4798,2.5045,1.0179,5.2739,3.8991,2.7659,0.5846,3.6056,0.9085,5.359,3.6879,2.0002,2.1689,2.2026,0.2463,3.6722,0.7036,6.2449,0.3548,0.1653,3.0459,4.5864,3.9948,10.8053,5.4745,2.9212,0.1771,0.0164,2.269,7.8037,1.0443,3.6896,2.2345,0.2661,2.9052,0.4659,2.0737,6.5411,3.9037,4.0955,5.5878,1.8838,4.3483,3.8801,1.2455,0.0002,2.049,0.4461,2.1645,0.8564,1.475,6.0334,5.4537,3.4282,5.0564,0.0098,4.0742,1.0589,3.1487,0.0278,1.0951,5.3496,0.2549,5.0627,0.0846,0.423,1.8675,0.0281,0.0002,1.7301,8.4888,5.7255,3.8263,1.3792,4.4851,0.7776,8.8529,1.7585,0.7105,3.7566,1.3191,1.1689,2.3933,2.7108,1.947,0.6455,1.4279,0.4559,1.6664,1.4199,1.0092,1.1877,4.8131,5.5289,0.1744,4.5898,2.1413,2.1434,2.9271,0.6222,1.1925,0.0003,1.5328,1.5186,3.1275,3.4641,0.8612,5.3559,3.4207,0.8403,1.2788,0.0012,1.2891,2.5493,0.0923,0.0384,1.8945,3.3265,0.7876,3.8855,1.0882,2.3378,3.821,2.7932,4.0072,5.5188,2.9631,7.9009,1.2866,4.1184,0.2975,7.8414,3.2608,3.2757,3.9781,0.7456,1.4208,1.1717,0.5936,3.4597,6.5438,0.6732,5.622,0.0148,1.2861,0.8566,1.8387,3.132,3.3875,0.525,1.1637,0.0043,8.4684,8.9891,5.938,1.9256,4.8561,3.6827,1.2691,1.0926,5.8903,2.1022,1.3511,0.9716,0.8789,0.5599,0.8983,2.2413,5.0948,3.6279,1.2534,1.2861,0.0003,4.8732,3.6378,2.7607,0.0009,7.8619,1.5921,0.726,1.0805,0.5937,1.3332,3.314,2.6131,0.1441,3.4869,0.2121,5.9894,0.6927,4.158,7.7524,0.7491,4.2328,3.7102,3.4513,0.0774,0.314,1.9512,1.7005,6.0519,0.2516,6.2884,0.0036,6.2058,1.627,5.9925,7.0786,9.7164,9.0048,3.3451,1.3675,4.0066,0.8763,0.0246,5.1876,0.6028,0.6825,2.6197,0.407,4.2453,0.0283,0.0312,4.6414,1.1468,0.4558,3.41,1.4088,3.797,4.873,1.4871,0.7412,2.1518,0.1301,0.3772,5.7405,2.5993,0.6994,5.9326,2.5475,0.0371,0.0004,5.7762,0.4979,5.4131,0.0146,0.012,1.5169,1.9531,0.9233,0.8682,4.6965,1.9667,6.4548,5.2186,2.7519,0.9566,0.6398,1.861,1.3953,1.2165,2.4398,4.5313,2.7138,3.8112,5.2943,0.631,1.0072,4.0967,0.019,0.1659,0.6825,6.2258,7.9533,3.1988,5.397,0.2286,1.7565,5.8934,0.0596,2.3247,0.0708,0.0152,0.0186,0.8648,3.6362,3.1853,3.6873,0.7631,0.4354,0.0005,0.0016,0.0021,2.4137,1.7143,1.8332,2.8616,0.012,0.0003,3.3288,5.0029,2.1579,0.178,5.7717,5.5765,1.8595,3.3025,0.5295,6.3381,1.5447,3.6807,1.1888,4.7722,0.0816,0.0008,1.8214,3.0785,2.251,0.2281,0.1787,0.4184,4.5594,4.897,1.4821,1.3657,0.9049,0.0006,0.0009,0.8889,1.099,0.0474,0.0004,6.4408,1.1018,4.1666,0.3069,4.1062,0.2544,1.8571]}
{"id":1687,"ended":true,"length":527,"text":"Despite his popularity with Liverpool fans, who referred to Fowler as `` God ``, Michael Owen and Emile Heskey had established themselves as Liverpool's regular strike partnership, leaving Fowler on the bench.\n\n\"Michael was brilliant,\" says Steve McManaman, who played alongside Fowler at Liverpool. ``He could do anything. He scored goals, he could stop, he was quick, he was clever, he did everything. If I did something, he'd do it better.\n\n\"Fowler will leave Arsenal in the next six months, and I will be very sad,\" former Liverpool striker Alan Smith said. \"He makes things happen for you, he gives you energy. He's so skilful, he changes games himself. I had the best time because everything I did went through him.\"\n\nFowler arrived at Upton Park in his usual stylish style at a news conference in which he answered a request from a cameraman to dance to Queen's ``We Are the Champions`` by doing his best Steve Bruce impersonation.\n\n\"I'm going to show everyone what a dance master I am,\" he said before wiggling his hips and shaking his shoulders.\n\nThe game did not work out well for West Ham. In the second half, Liverpool's forwards scored three goals within six minutes.\n\nFowler scored in the 51st minute after his shot was parried by Richard Wright before Owen scored from the rebound. Liverpool completed the third in the 60th when Heskey finished off a move started by Fowler.\n\n\"I think he is the best player in the league, to be completely honest,\" former Liverpool manager Graeme Souness said. \"He's been at Liverpool eight years, and he has the ability, desire and commitment to continue.\n\n\"He plays with goals, but he also produces them from wherever he can to help the team. He's a complete football player.\"\n\nLiverpool finished the season eight points ahead of Arsenal.\n\nSouness said his team had been affected by a mid-season slump.\n\n\"We lost our way in the second half of the season,\" he said. \"We had a bad run.\"\n\nFowler showed little emotion during the entire match aside from a brief smile.\n\nFowler has played in nine games for England. After he came on as an extra-time replacement for Les Reed with 15 minutes left at Wembley Stadium, England won 2-1 and Fowler got the winning goal.\n\nHe hasn't had any injuries or other knocks since his return to Arsenal from his first loan spell last July.\n\nFowler, who missed one match because of a minor virus, said the decision to leave Liverpool in the offseason was easy.\n\n\"I was told very early in the season that it was time for me to leave,\" he said.","token_len":581,"entropy":[4.9369,5.8506,2.3581,8.6553,0.2792,0.5317,5.4302,7.3956,0.0236,11.2835,0.1016,9.327,12.6571,9.125,1.6146,7.0276,3.8942,4.3855,7.9347,1.6941,0.044,0.0777,4.1101,6.7766,1.0323,0.1927,2.5464,0.2076,7.1691,6.9241,7.1558,2.4684,6.5713,3.7657,3.5101,0.4031,0.5567,1.8871,1.2969,0.0033,5.4178,3.6088,2.2971,4.585,2.7976,3.1374,6.0667,3.9934,0.395,0.0093,0.3565,1.3191,2.146,2.7744,0.6999,1.8937,2.4286,1.2126,3.0419,0.6314,3.9618,2.9213,1.7895,1.0584,0.5994,5.1853,1.4436,1.7293,0.5497,2.9855,5.1802,3.97,0.2646,1.9374,5.0973,1.3805,0.3843,0.9494,4.4854,1.0091,0.3039,4.3966,1.4648,1.4149,4.9025,3.2032,5.2809,3.2925,1.9175,0.7583,2.0241,1.1626,0.0385,7.5506,1.2935,1.823,0.0003,0.4534,5.3567,0.0023,5.3454,6.2685,7.2939,2.619,1.4349,3.0857,3.662,0.5305,1.3024,1.866,1.8597,3.6972,1.4795,2.3356,3.2126,7.3282,9.3825,1.1428,1.7098,4.0544,3.9679,1.7967,0.4875,1.1112,1.1273,6.2006,4.4601,0.9847,1.7554,3.8971,1.7321,1.3474,3.3742,0.2356,4.5942,1.3556,0.9158,1.3297,4.4298,9.0191,0.0319,0.0098,1.5681,0.8753,6.2091,3.8236,9.7065,0.6651,2.6173,4.9178,2.8679,3.1201,2.1273,6.6058,8.0699,2.681,1.3667,4.4802,3.7293,1.0052,2.1493,0.2534,0.0003,1.819,0.0042,5.0155,0.8407,6.2091,0.0016,1.104,5.3941,6.6063,5.057,2.1157,3.0977,3.0161,6.8277,0.0139,2.016,3.5602,0.1377,5.9861,2.1035,5.9522,1.2128,2.7178,7.1951,0.0046,1.1993,7.5929,2.4205,8.2694,1.1592,7.4282,4.943,2.0965,2.1959,0.631,2.9725,3.8192,6.6727,3.4263,1.3835,8.1384,5.763,1.7172,0.1336,1.1548,0.7709,0.0004,2.1367,1.1,2.4613,3.2702,0.1868,4.8245,4.1956,1.9477,2.5042,8.8376,5.0249,2.5205,0.1002,0.6878,0.6636,0.4678,4.7345,7.5734,3.0375,0.0019,0.2289,3.3689,1.6515,4.686,0.2849,4.8956,0.5017,1.0295,0.0003,2.892,6.0075,5.0351,0.2576,5.2797,0.2657,3.2212,0.3153,7.4382,0.3848,2.6229,3.9547,0.9638,2.5162,0.1172,0.5067,4.7487,2.4177,7.7775,3.0829,2.6966,0.8772,6.2077,2.7065,0.1876,1.9249,1.4592,0.0003,2.4791,0.0056,3.1735,2.8617,0.7062,5.3923,0.012,0.0094,2.5166,4.1338,4.8529,0.9434,4.4131,0.006,0.5663,6.448,3.3769,5.3394,6.2836,3.0148,2.2057,2.4793,4.7864,0.7601,3.6037,6.8248,1.1349,3.8394,3.8802,2.0051,6.0013,0.0312,4.5276,5.5244,0.0003,5.1621,1.0988,1.1025,5.8234,11.8522,0.0676,2.4711,1.2429,0.3271,0.0003,2.4632,1.3195,2.5383,1.742,3.2925,2.4478,0.8447,1.2635,1.1007,0.229,2.9197,2.3705,5.571,1.4732,7.1948,0.0205,0.4447,6.1205,1.1418,2.4379,6.952,0.0005,0.4417,0.0023,0.0001,0.5007,0.4409,0.7782,0.97,1.6488,3.4357,3.7286,1.5933,7.4472,0.5514,1.1768,1.2883,1.0204,1.8467,3.0283,2.6383,3.1588,8.285,0.3269,4.9729,0.4975,5.1266,2.2927,1.2018,0.0003,0.1852,1.1575,5.2881,2.4243,7.9032,1.4,3.2617,0.8642,3.0705,6.3984,5.488,5.5746,6.1816,0.1944,4.0584,5.1417,2.6961,1.7214,0.2102,1.1543,0.9983,1.2292,1.5445,5.1727,3.8551,0.8021,2.4139,0.2952,0.0003,2.2235,4.6476,1.9592,2.2353,6.8975,0.0523,3.8981,0.0117,1.7888,2.6907,1.4204,0.0002,4.5531,1.5488,0.0004,1.6263,3.885,1.8549,1.7955,2.1155,5.9842,0.0932,2.3279,6.5657,2.7881,0.5445,2.3557,1.7164,1.1366,0.0002,0.4807,1.3298,3.5972,3.0015,3.8598,2.429,0.5829,3.7943,0.0487,1.7837,0.2186,0.094,1.1941,0.155,0.0789,0.0492,0.3437,0.9227,1.9515,1.1838,3.985,3.0203,6.1055,0.5417,0.0003,2.76,0.0057,6.5895,3.9071,3.3853,2.6232,1.208,8.3086,3.2617,9.7333,0.0021,2.1494,3.4745,3.925,1.1145,0.9348,0.0002,4.463,0.0761,2.8249,3.1017,2.0215,4.0415,2.156,0.7933,4.0328,3.3833,5.7149,3.4091,4.4867,1.8444,1.344,2.3083,5.5502,2.3151,0.1688,3.7932,1.3057,9.6636,3.1889,5.8721,6.8559,0.5214,0.6875,4.37,3.0542,2.6819,0.3543,4.1353,3.617,2.0807,0.0017,0.4951,3.3426,4.1441,4.8574,1.5967,6.4573,0.2018,1.145,0.5378,0.0003,2.7541,7.5109,0.0011,3.4102,2.5241,4.0751,3.86,3.4007,7.6495,2.4064,2.6415,1.748,0.9871,5.1084,2.86,3.3184,3.6574,2.9019,0.083,4.5747,4.0612,0.4011,0.7285,0.0003,2.4104,0.003,2.7133,0.7232,4.5579,5.4355,2.7579,3.4046,0.0291,0.6819,6.5241,9.7356,1.254,3.0399,3.1457,4.1533,0.3716,1.3675,2.5767,4.1237,0.8689,5.8851,0.829,5.0678,0.6949,0.3509,0.0002,0.2659,0.9283,2.6894,4.0687,6.5489,1.4322,1.4338,0.3185,0.8285,0.5513,2.8655,0.4999,3.4067,1.3564,0.1134,0.052,0.8863,1.1255,0.169,0.0613,0.0488]}
{"id":650,"ended":true,"length":546,"text":"In the days leading up to the Peach Bowl, one sportswriter called Virginia Tech's 1986 football season a `` season of surprises. `` Tech began the season having gone 6 \u2013 5 in 1985 \u2013 the best record of Al Groh's first two seasons as head coach \u2013 before the Hokies rebounded to finish 7 \u2013 4. This season also marked the third straight year in which Tech was invited to four postseason bowl games. Groh said the Hokies started 1987 with a mission. ``Every year we talk about finishing stronger and this year we really set out to make it happen,`` Groh said.\n\nIt didn't take long for the Hokies to move themselves up the chain of national success. After opening with a 31 \u2013 3 pounding of Western Carolina. Tech defeated Boston College on the road to improve to 3 \u2013 0. The loss of quarterback Jeff George to injury during the BC game was a major blow to the Hokies as he provided much of Tech's offensive punch.\n\nTech's remaining games were both on the road and were all tough. The Hokies defeated South Florida 29 \u2013 17 followed by a 45 \u2013 6 pounding of North Carolina. A pair of convincing road wins and wins at home to close the regular season, meant that Tech would go to the ACC Championship where it defeated Virginia, 23 \u2013 14. Tech was back in the Orange Bowl.\n\nIn the Orange Bowl, the Hokies played the Miami Hurricanes. Miami was one of the preseason favorites to win the National Championship and the team it replaced last season, Florida State, was the other # 6 seed. Tech and Miami had met twice previously that season with both meetings between the archrivals being played in Blacksburg. Tech had won both by a score of 28 \u2013 21.\n\nTech quarterback Tom Savage completed 24 of 42 passes for 328 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. His longest pass of the day was 57 yards to wide receiver Anthony Carter. Savage said, ``Miami is a great team of course but we figured to ourselves that it was still up to us to win. `` The game was very tight until the second half. In the fourth quarter, defensive end Jim Bostic forced Miami running back Thomas 1 1\/2 quarters later. A roughing the passer penalty was called on Miami which would give Tech new life and would be the key to the Hokies' win. One play after the Roughing the Passer penalty was called, defensive tackle Larry Reynolds scooped up the loose ball and returned it 41 yards for a touchdown. This would be the game in a nutshell for Florida State, the Seminoles gave Tech too many chances to win the game for the Seminoles to hang. In the end, the Hokies won the game 9 - 3. The win made Al Groh the first individual ACC coach in three years to take a team to the Orange Bowl.","token_len":581,"entropy":[2.6222,5.4377,2.4072,0.0221,0.0067,0.5743,12.177,1.8263,0.3787,5.3598,8.7558,0.9526,0.0199,2.7402,7.4767,1.0311,1.0613,10.1029,4.2055,2.1262,2.2723,9.3737,13.8485,0.5046,6.4503,3.599,4.6652,7.5513,6.1546,1.6332,0.7877,5.7115,5.1203,3.6364,10.2438,2.7252,1.7278,7.3061,5.4788,3.7474,3.6442,2.55,3.0835,10.8833,6.5287,0.9807,0.5895,3.7942,2.5146,0.7534,2.9243,1.2412,0.046,7.216,4.9192,2.5406,5.4014,0.0096,6.6923,0.0051,1.385,3.4235,3.7775,0.7125,1.4598,2.4403,4.1992,1.8706,5.8566,2.6841,0.2441,3.5202,1.0955,0.7641,3.2119,0.1547,3.0204,2.6993,8.2649,0.1335,8.3638,5.4421,3.9288,0.0207,0.8273,8.3012,0.0017,4.0107,1.6343,2.436,0.0059,5.8541,10.7204,1.2312,0.8073,9.4236,3.7527,0.9574,6.755,1.4205,1.4536,5.1073,0.144,6.8197,6.1406,1.6444,6.4441,0.8309,0.6019,4.759,5.3935,1.4359,0.1431,3.3959,1.2405,2.2725,2.8693,5.0416,0.8648,0.0012,0.0741,0.0919,3.4491,0.0004,4.2856,3.4024,0.0031,1.0362,0.2558,0.2717,0.8596,1.2345,0.0087,0.1177,4.6261,8.0853,2.1859,0.8951,6.8732,0.4392,5.0147,5.3022,0.5568,3.6949,5.3242,3.7057,0.4407,4.1753,2.4495,3.9208,11.7095,1.1649,6.0913,2.8461,5.7684,5.8858,4.9903,6.5905,0.0512,3.9504,1.8713,0.6299,1.9226,6.2736,0.2626,2.8644,0.4504,3.1623,1.1231,1.6707,5.0284,3.1195,3.6747,5.3855,5.5448,2.4034,3.164,6.2935,0.4473,10.7923,0.6006,2.0719,1.5653,2.3255,0.1905,0.9707,0.4414,0.3275,0.0066,4.2656,4.6004,7.462,3.5386,0.53,5.5896,0.0171,2.6687,3.7386,0.6923,2.0059,0.0002,5.9534,2.5421,7.9763,2.8478,1.6288,7.0128,3.8363,0.6613,0.116,1.2639,6.1025,5.2352,7.9891,1.7889,1.5693,0.5748,0.0058,4.6993,5.0408,2.2663,5.3836,0.651,3.1957,9.2854,0.0811,1.5996,5.1844,0.0745,3.0754,8.7682,0.3553,3.0908,0.0989,1.257,4.0229,4.6511,0.0215,7.7504,4.6683,0.9071,4.3572,5.1073,3.799,1.3488,3.3416,2.8492,1.3998,2.08,0.0102,3.7461,8.343,1.8018,1.655,2.2129,3.4019,2.7022,0.9494,3.6848,1.775,9.9944,0.9328,5.9561,3.5944,3.8323,4.8907,0.0166,2.7257,0.588,2.5677,2.6739,4.356,0.5955,0.5321,5.9957,0.0272,3.8442,0.7233,0.0002,2.9121,1.0132,4.2614,0.0225,0.3294,1.3532,0.2723,0.0086,4.0534,2.6721,4.097,0.5484,2.6462,2.538,2.2578,4.0096,0.0554,0.7641,7.543,1.8283,1.6765,0.4035,0.3961,5.05,0.1646,2.0783,2.5678,3.9318,6.6559,5.8456,5.2062,0.6872,1.8057,3.4621,0.5,0.6367,1.9125,2.5744,4.9292,10.0654,9.227,0.2499,0.7006,3.1338,5.0133,1.0926,2.7918,4.2154,2.6525,3.7259,5.9842,0.6288,4.5632,4.0018,10.3454,5.7955,0.9932,10.12,1.7651,0.001,3.5538,2.9598,1.1135,6.0588,0.0065,1.0652,2.5137,2.4585,1.9303,2.1181,5.9532,1.336,1.0811,0.0372,3.8787,0.8705,3.397,0.6889,1.301,0.0003,4.291,7.5401,5.2297,4.8672,5.3496,4.0254,0.275,4.4219,0.0394,0.0501,5.3292,0.0037,2.2352,1.3607,0.0816,0.1749,4.2883,0.0096,1.6891,3.8299,5.5463,1.4271,0.4673,0.0557,4.3439,0.5618,6.0912,0.1258,2.3632,3.8621,0.1605,6.1295,5.8946,0.9663,2.8792,4.3945,2.7772,0.2957,5.8519,1.9257,1.1979,1.61,0.8743,5.9609,6.4962,2.5526,1.8573,7.7216,4.0898,5.9118,1.2841,2.6545,1.0519,5.9872,4.8381,0.245,0.7819,0.4351,1.7386,2.2792,4.9937,2.7649,2.8763,1.4672,4.7928,3.5733,4.6702,1.4519,3.227,0.2716,2.0709,4.6314,0.4666,2.3364,0.0406,0.4729,7.2318,0.9344,6.0285,4.782,3.8566,5.3832,5.2798,4.8304,0.0395,5.8873,9.2373,6.7097,0.7488,0.0757,5.5952,4.2836,2.3537,4.0972,7.2691,3.1566,1.5675,0.0942,2.746,2.2166,1.851,2.1054,3.1249,5.1335,4.8583,2.9955,0.8927,8.8258,0.9216,2.5876,5.4952,2.8587,1.419,5.5949,0.6346,1.9723,2.6573,0.0098,1.3012,2.9577,0.4168,7.0936,2.6285,2.0027,1.092,8.7346,0.0136,0.0948,1.5171,1.7275,0.6242,1.9076,0.8636,1.1769,5.5371,2.1452,5.2981,7.5,7.9078,0.0335,0.0967,1.6701,4.8915,0.0645,0.737,4.0875,0.0867,7.1602,0.0556,0.6644,0.2523,0.256,0.2739,4.9532,2.3868,1.2005,0.756,2.768,3.3821,5.5947,0.6176,2.827,4.7242,0.0227,2.7357,3.2113,3.3821,0.0131,7.3184,1.7695,8.0647,2.0323,1.3298,0.7308,1.0236,1.5926,0.7632,4.2651,1.3471,4.0677,0.0113,1.002,5.5602,5.0878,4.6174,0.3882,1.1647,0.3145,1.6201,1.0988,0.0037,3.1538,1.506,0.2372,5.9604,2.4305,2.1309,0.4131,2.5722,4.7361,4.9488,8.1916,0.0067,0.0008,0.8867,2.0105,8.5592,5.4822,1.9804,2.3587,3.212,0.9669,0.3101,3.6719,2.2174,2.0951,0.6818,0.2956,2.602,0.0067,0.8108]}

Unfortunately, due to ongoing difficulties at the club and with the club administration, Fowler has not been able and willing to sign.\n\nAfter leaving Cardiff, he played two games for Bradford City and had an ankle operation on June 12 2008 that kept him out until November and was a major reason as to why Bradford finished bottom of the Football League.\n\nHe was released at the end of the season with the City stating that they could not guarantee that he would receive his payments or that the money would actually be available in the form of wages.\n\nIn December 2008, he stated that he was prepared to take legal action against the City in a dispute over unpaid wages or damages for lost earnings if he did not receive what he was owed.\n\nAs of July 29 2008, Fowler has still not received what is owed him,\n\nFowler stated in February 2009 that his wage claim would not receive a final hearing because it related to money owed to another player.\n\nFowler and the City are yet to reach an agreement despite legal proceedings between the parties for many months.\n\nOn 24 March 2010, it was reported that former England manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson had said that he had advised Fowler to file for bankruptcy as the striker had been unable to gain a job in football since leaving Cardiff City and that he had also made many bad choices when it came to money.\n\nFowler stated the next day that he would not be pursuing the case against City.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been too difficult now, financially,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to spend any more money and be embroiled in the courts.

{"id":4820,"ended":true,"length":513,"text":"From the early 1860s whaling declined rapidly with the increasing use of petroleum, the onset of the Californian goldrush, and the American Civil War \u2013 with unfortunate consequences for the island. To compound the problem, the British government imposed a ban on whaling in 1876. The island\u2019s fleet, together with much of the country\u2019s other whaling vessels, was sunk or captured by the Admiralty in the ensuing years.\n\nWith the beginning of the 20th century American whaling began, and by 1900 there were two competing whaling fleets in the area. While the American fleet never established itself in significant numbers on the island, the British remained as the dominant force. Until the turn of the century American whaling became very lucrative, until whaling was outlawed in 1939 as a result of pressure from Conservationists such as Paul Watson - who was himself a sonar operator in the Hawaiian fleet. Since then much effort has been concentrated on the protection of whales, but the practice is still banned and will most probably be banned for ever.\n\nIn addition to the whaling industry there was an industry that followed whaling in the form of the processing or freezing of whale oil - first to separate spermaceti from blubber ( the oil being called \u201cmineral oil\u201d). At first whales were captured for oil in many different ports around the world. When the ships were returning to port it would take oil out at all ports along the north Atlantic coast. In time this method became known as \u201cwhaleroading\u201d, and whaling was carried out as a \u201chauling on\u201d and \u201chauling off\u201d. At its zenith whaling in the southern hemisphere involved the transportation of over 400 vessels and over a million men.\n\nThere had also been a growing tourism industry following the advent of steamships. In 1882 a company called the Great Whale Boat Association began running tours round the island, with the help of the \u201cHakana Kai\u201d steam yacht. At this time there were also whale watching cruises to the isles of Eupoia and Kekaha. The company was run by Captain Thomas Grieve, an eccentric who had his own private island and often dressed up in old times clothing and played his fiddle. After his death he was buried on an island (now part of Pearl Harbour Naval Submarine Base) and the original steam yacht that carried him and his passengers made a short career as a luxury passenger liner before being scrapped.\n\nThe tourism industry still thrives with the \u201cPearl Harbour whale watching company\u201d still active for most of the rest of the year. They use different vessels and offer various styles of tours (ranging from the cheapest to the most expensive), and are always trying new techniques in order to attract customers.","token_len":581,"entropy":[2.4913,5.1176,6.8758,0.2259,12.3851,0.952,7.9648,3.5154,4.4342,0.7939,5.5372,2.5664,0.0214,6.1483,2.1673,3.4743,8.9472,0.0157,1.2797,9.6258,0.0172,4.9657,5.5104,1.3869,0.2468,0.7961,4.9423,2.1513,0.0039,6.8793,3.6006,11.0475,0.8592,0.9998,1.0671,6.2415,3.026,5.2822,8.3135,0.7236,1.667,0.3234,1.351,4.7773,2.4222,4.1883,1.482,3.5734,0.0609,0.8217,0.0158,1.4565,1.4369,3.8214,1.227,2.2156,4.5489,16.1134,8.2592,2.237,6.6517,3.0457,7.2186,0.0007,5.3535,0.1133,0.5298,4.3255,3.6632,0.1669,0.3565,5.51,3.5163,0.1317,1.3329,0.3905,1.3851,5.5035,4.4125,3.0767,1.3312,0.7714,6.8048,0.0406,1.0904,2.625,4.3144,2.5214,0.2821,1.6819,0.0052,4.427,0.7991,5.7438,0.0031,0.3411,3.2051,0.0216,0.0497,7.0887,0.5586,0.07,2.4127,4.0768,1.7771,3.3237,4.4695,3.0186,0.215,4.8684,5.6461,2.7312,0.0642,0.9002,2.7524,1.6621,3.9004,0.7249,4.7434,1.0065,2.8053,1.1526,7.4118,5.8558,1.4246,2.033,8.3385,0.1755,4.5236,0.4012,1.4122,0.3331,1.8976,1.0513,6.1341,4.9426,1.628,1.6024,2.2179,2.1819,6.5666,0.9174,4.5832,0.0038,0.0188,0.8274,3.8402,0.2368,0.0343,4.3316,4.8199,4.3592,1.3617,7.1788,6.8434,0.1345,2.1024,2.1094,0.445,5.4815,4.9724,1.0187,3.7198,0.0199,6.4578,0.1982,12.5783,1.3051,6.252,0.0045,4.9089,5.8713,8.1591,1.7102,2.4483,6.2499,0.9167,9.6161,6.3275,1.1753,2.4598,0.8944,6.645,6.7627,0.8558,5.1125,0.6493,7.244,5.9544,0.1259,0.0772,7.5917,0.2582,2.089,5.5745,0.0827,3.7616,1.6827,3.1629,1.7832,5.3452,2.3964,1.1046,3.9223,3.3044,6.1379,5.1091,3.6712,2.2908,2.2767,2.3567,5.7376,0.6099,0.6405,0.0003,3.2146,3.4833,0.2211,1.2298,2.6372,0.0366,2.2371,3.3612,4.1218,2.824,3.5157,2.5609,6.2784,3.2596,0.0628,2.2523,0.9026,4.5267,0.0032,2.2577,10.0819,5.9271,4.8193,0.1639,1.2523,4.0903,4.0725,6.4523,4.7979,7.673,5.9483,7.1592,0.1414,0.6078,7.9243,0.0767,0.0144,3.5603,8.5682,3.9336,4.7068,6.3722,9.2466,6.4312,8.2942,0.2648,2.513,4.0384,7.6283,1.6441,4.8077,2.2078,3.9353,0.4107,5.8416,3.1605,4.7521,3.3694,6.0998,1.6964,8.2982,3.1599,0.0776,0.4762,1.3625,4.3701,1.4304,5.6798,1.2295,8.1591,0.806,3.3323,3.8213,2.8115,2.4137,8.1303,4.8868,6.0753,5.9469,2.4553,5.6723,0.1103,6.3833,3.8992,0.5819,1.5378,2.9244,5.1188,2.9185,5.191,2.0303,2.3268,0.0283,4.6731,0.7894,3.7978,3.6208,5.2046,2.8667,0.2942,2.0286,2.2987,1.0444,3.9599,0.0986,1.7098,5.1692,0.2081,3.8381,0.8517,9.9373,1.0407,8.3415,1.0778,6.1385,6.5103,1.8229,5.7006,0.8882,0.0783,4.1725,0.1197,1.3865,0.3561,0.0147,1.3067,4.761,3.5035,7.7773,0.0135,0.0001,4.1995,0.0759,3.6275,1.1778,7.2775,2.8494,8.5547,1.9689,5.1024,0.0631,4.5523,4.1343,4.4279,2.74,2.9618,3.2955,0.8539,4.6973,0.7711,1.1744,0.0003,4.5865,4.8856,2.6765,0.031,1.1572,3.1564,7.3349,0.2989,6.0423,0.6375,3.8481,0.0046,8.0128,0.6998,0.967,1.762,1.9921,2.0728,3.8071,2.3131,4.3924,0.8084,1.8405,5.2539,2.3005,5.1688,2.5328,3.3232,6.1099,3.712,7.9925,0.1928,2.1455,2.1736,3.1724,2.0035,5.7084,0.0227,1.8242,6.3728,0.2525,4.7248,7.5826,5.3028,7.7191,2.7455,1.2288,10.5514,5.1813,1.048,4.0838,2.6211,0.2536,2.627,0.4767,3.1954,3.9619,4.346,4.829,0.1608,3.436,1.3709,9.4999,1.932,0.4498,8.024,7.4702,3.7886,4.5194,1.4749,3.979,6.4238,4.9473,1.3223,2.1161,3.8071,1.6942,4.4873,0.3783,4.335,3.9869,4.9544,6.825,1.2258,3.7769,6.4383,4.5713,1.8148,5.3672,0.4786,2.4061,3.3296,2.8865,6.4728,7.9413,0.9804,1.8626,6.8181,6.5562,4.1805,3.0249,6.0157,4.373,7.1204,0.5304,1.0812,4.4725,2.7841,0.3293,2.1952,1.3084,1.9201,2.582,4.2859,0.3366,6.3467,3.7515,3.8324,0.0032,8.6601,1.4846,7.3841,6.8128,0.6243,0.3531,0.7117,2.2033,2.1454,5.9323,6.0361,2.0921,4.3158,4.0399,0.4014,4.6901,0.5232,3.3798,5.1244,2.4749,4.1004,5.399,2.081,0.48,5.5757,6.347,1.3748,5.8747,1.4816,3.0455,1.4903,0.505,0.0003,2.0471,7.2302,0.4026,5.6258,1.2663,0.5838,4.2144,0.9558,6.0921,0.0569,8.2267,0.0042,0.4276,6.911,1.4705,5.6545,5.3711,0.8479,5.3666,4.2399,5.3109,5.0511,0.216,0.2169,5.1689,0.0017,0.2402,1.5494,0.6576,4.897,5.6296,6.7283,3.0283,1.6915,5.014,3.4023,7.4944,0.3112,3.1943,4.3206,4.8799,0.0456,2.6463,5.9009,0.9367,0.1325,0.4415,0.8651,2.5559,1.7147,2.6585,3.6458,4.5847,4.3486,3.4744,3.6933,1.4394,0.0122,3.3535,3.313,0.4824]}
{"id":2022,"ended":false,"length":483,"text":"The 2 \/ 4th Machine Gun Battalion was one of four machine gun battalions raised as part of the all volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force ( 2nd AIF ) for service overseas during the Second World War [1]. It fought as part of the First Australian Imperial Force ( 1st AIF ), the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ), and the Australian Contingent during the war.\n\nFormed at Balaclava, New South Wales, in July 1942, with a total strength of 1,320, it was deployed to Bougainville and fought in battles during the 1944\u201345 Bougainville Campaign. In later years it was stationed at RAAF Base Darwin. Following the war it transferred to Thailand, where it was disbanded in 1949.\n\n2 \/ 4th MG Battalion raised on 17 October 1942 as part of the mobilisation of the AIF after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. By the time the battalion was allocated to the 1st Airlanding Force, 1st Airlanding Division, in April 1943, it had reached its full strength of 3 Officers, 147 Enlisted Men and 29 NCOs. The battalion was commanded by Captain D.H. Hargreaves.\n\nIn late 1942, the battalion\u2019s strength grew to 1,380; however, this included several temporary reinforcements that had served in other battalions. During the next year, it was assigned six machine guns at Port Moresby. From late 1944 to mid-1945, when the battalion left for Bougainville, it was based at Rabaul. Later the Australians were given Bougainville to prepare for combat and the 2\/4th was assigned a defensive post near the village of Buka.\n\nDuring the conflict the battalion was heavily involved in the fighting. Major-General Robert D. White, who was in charge of the operation, was to declare the 2\/4th as \u201cthe best rifle battalion on Bougainville \u2026 well organized, with sound individual soldiers\u201d.\n\nIn December 1944 it was tasked to protect a bridge along the Koro River near the village of Agana. It was later withdrawn from defensive positions near Buka which was still being cleared of Japanese forces at the time. A month later, while attempting to protect a bridge at Buka, it was ambushed and suffered many casualties. Later that month it was relieved by the 1st\/4th Machine Gun Battalion.\n\nFollowing the end of operations on Bougainville, the battalion was transferred to Darwin and remained there until its disbandment in March 1949. At one stage it was the largest battalion in the Australian Army. With its disbandment, 2\/4th MG Battalion became the last Australian 2\/machine gun battalion.\n\n2 \/ 4th Machine Gun Battalion received many decorations during the duration of Bougainville Campaign including the following:","token_len":582,"entropy":[6.696,8.7241,2.4732,5.7988,8.7993,2.203,4.1447,3.1187,4.309,0.0687,4.3594,6.9074,0.5256,0.8489,0.0001,6.807,4.5074,0.6844,0.0009,0.6244,9.2617,7.1716,6.8718,7.222,9.2875,3.2767,1.5421,7.8942,2.8792,2.1746,2.5026,0.858,4.9394,5.3841,5.9439,2.7688,0.8747,1.5395,0.5746,0.0005,6.7865,2.6,0.5551,2.7094,4.8796,4.2892,0.6312,0.0011,0.4113,2.9843,0.2267,1.0077,0.2239,0.4889,0.964,0.0721,0.3821,0.0114,2.0963,2.4285,3.366,3.4073,1.3224,0.6123,4.0949,0.042,0.5352,0.7613,0.3754,1.149,9.9708,0.6207,1.6189,7.8992,0.4585,4.4704,0.7541,1.6001,0.0151,7.4534,0.9167,3.9765,5.787,2.6273,0.0017,1.6507,4.6104,0.1122,0.0014,0.8212,1.3306,3.9938,1.97,0.3105,6.2705,2.3854,1.6038,5.6158,0.0153,2.9706,0.0381,6.1838,1.9238,1.5224,0.7032,3.8402,0.7311,10.1371,0.3955,0.0002,2.5873,7.3545,1.4753,5.7134,4.2215,0.3623,6.5884,3.7526,0.3803,13.036,0.0053,0.0087,2.3857,0.9296,2.6532,6.6195,0.8868,1.3379,0.8353,3.9917,0.8888,5.2731,5.484,2.2704,5.8228,1.8072,5.5769,0.7273,2.2883,1.4623,6.1194,0.2664,9.7533,1.7074,0.8496,0.0473,1.4697,5.2481,0.6484,3.5397,0.5099,0.8298,0.0002,5.267,0.8273,0.2825,0.0148,6.9786,1.8312,8.0869,4.399,4.7909,2.6006,1.6748,2.1587,0.9975,0.0009,0.2952,10.4522,0.2928,0.841,0.7601,4.048,0.7318,4.2808,0.5206,6.0011,0.3143,3.3741,0.3697,1.0678,5.9892,1.8032,2.2991,1.6807,3.3592,0.8363,7.9154,0.6639,0.9994,2.7343,0.0261,5.8731,11.498,3.1001,3.2745,1.8252,5.0265,0.666,2.2783,3.2794,0.1291,3.2742,2.4957,2.5434,2.8905,1.2759,0.7224,0.7864,0.6013,4.4151,1.7452,3.1445,0.7664,2.8359,2.7916,14.5967,1.6989,9.5636,8.1806,0.155,4.8256,1.0728,5.4677,5.8151,0.0538,0.1245,0.6102,2.1636,1.7707,0.9011,4.8442,0.0284,2.6243,5.4525,1.094,3.6337,0.0528,4.3239,3.9261,0.3756,0.0023,1.4731,0.8757,0.0002,2.9057,3.1262,1.6915,0.9148,1.2163,1.8582,17.9952,8.5342,2.432,4.9704,3.7044,0.7224,2.1133,0.0442,5.9424,5.3627,4.1795,0.2867,3.8228,6.8335,5.0063,6.8819,7.0102,3.6691,2.5178,5.5729,1.1237,3.7272,3.0288,0.0004,1.1724,3.7668,0.4378,4.5798,2.2885,0.7928,2.6894,0.9709,2.6453,9.2635,8.2175,0.9235,4.4496,6.015,3.4834,0.0389,0.0,1.7558,5.9535,3.1188,2.7934,0.9323,1.3672,0.5724,2.1682,0.2989,5.9131,1.0925,0.7994,5.8668,1.6066,7.1303,0.0004,0.0038,0.2214,1.1155,1.3895,5.6529,0.5446,6.7422,0.7027,2.6699,4.9873,3.5028,9.3842,2.8229,2.3465,9.9832,0.0025,0.0058,3.5682,6.3701,0.314,4.1768,3.9781,2.8373,3.8615,3.8964,0.0268,0.0555,2.8557,2.3746,4.8005,6.4242,5.7133,3.7163,2.2907,3.5586,0.1781,3.9514,8.4427,1.5026,0.8418,0.0002,4.0132,0.4434,4.887,3.2156,1.5785,1.0954,4.7933,1.5443,0.0889,1.2085,2.9137,2.666,6.4772,2.634,0.0424,4.0091,4.3452,0.7115,5.6734,1.143,2.6311,1.4815,2.3634,0.5457,0.0957,0.6054,5.3587,0.9486,2.6255,6.2503,7.1994,1.4947,5.3928,0.9523,0.0193,0.0094,2.7953,12.9161,4.9149,3.5913,5.043,6.2062,0.8353,3.697,3.563,0.0005,0.0015,8.066,7.742,8.0985,1.2978,3.2287,9.0912,8.5211,7.5767,6.6808,7.0233,1.4261,2.0379,0.0003,2.4353,3.5274,1.2122,4.1114,0.4133,6.3681,2.103,4.4603,3.1636,4.4452,4.0477,0.6173,11.5342,4.276,1.0851,3.4788,2.0616,1.7085,0.099,5.4834,7.2049,2.841,0.9833,2.3766,0.5908,3.8783,3.9388,1.081,9.4428,1.8111,3.8446,3.1389,0.4078,5.713,2.1094,6.0195,3.4991,4.7783,1.5787,4.0806,1.7344,4.7318,0.9065,0.3444,0.3933,3.9669,5.1007,0.1538,0.8099,4.9659,4.7336,0.0955,3.9615,1.4537,1.0344,2.897,2.4958,0.2292,0.4047,2.0536,0.2173,2.7447,0.0002,1.8307,5.6471,5.5039,0.2026,0.449,5.2716,1.5817,1.401,2.06,0.311,4.7053,2.3582,1.0398,2.6684,0.0641,6.3694,2.6106,0.0082,3.3163,0.0725,0.0595,1.3624,0.6175,0.0002,5.14,0.3354,3.1163,0.0019,5.8894,3.2321,0.7733,0.0004,0.001,0.6429,0.6304,1.7798,0.9453,2.2754,0.1089,6.174,2.1231,4.6563,0.6112,0.4078,2.6879,4.5472,0.3198,0.4841,3.4022,5.5318,0.2053,4.2995,5.0994,3.2249,1.1468,0.5955,4.8531,4.4751,3.9022,0.8445,0.6204,1.5992,1.6692,1.342,5.8786,2.3322,9.7463,0.268,1.5041,3.5724,0.4705,0.0085,0.0056,6.7267,1.2225,2.8283,0.6216,4.797,1.3089,5.9189,0.8066,15.5776,0.1542,0.689,1.9645,0.6448,0.0002,2.5295,0.22,0.0813,0.0081,2.0091,0.0148,0.0956,5.08,7.251,2.6573,2.3438,0.594,7.7005,0.007,7.295,0.0003,0.0024,5.8399,5.0993,1.1492,5.2535,0.468]}
{"id":1276,"ended":true,"length":451,"text":"The size of a burn is measured as a percentage of total body surface area ( TBSA ) affected by partial thickness or full thickness burns. First @ - @ degree burns that are considered'superficial' are defined as those areas that have a TBSA less than 20%. Burn severity is measured by the amount of heat a burn can conduct away from the area of the burn and can be expressed by the Rankin Scale which consists of a scale from IV (deepest burn) to I (least severe) and is illustrated in Figure 1\n\nFigure 1\n\nThe Rankin Scale for Burn and Injury Severity\n\nBurns can be divided into three categories - partial thickness, full thickness and thermal injury. The amount of heat that is lost in a burn is a function of the thickness of the burn as well as its surface area. Therefore, a burn with a TBSA less than 20% will have a much less amount of heat loss than a burn with a TBSA greater than 20%.\n\nFigure 2 below is a pictorial depiction of Burn Injury Severity.

titles digitally, but now they're packaged together for the first time as part of the Forgotten Realms: The Archives - Collection Two.\n\nThis collection comprises four games\n\nPool of Radiance\n\nThe Dragonlance Chronicles Gold\n\nDragons of Amber\n\nIcewind Dale 2\n\nAll of which have seen extensive updates and expansions since their original release.\n\nThe original game included with this box is of course Pool of Radiance, the game that many of the other games would build upon.\n\nYou can also buy both the boxed version and download a separate ( DRM FREE ) copy.\n\nYou can also get the boxed version of each of the Gold Box series individually\n\nYou can also find these games at the GOG.com Online Store ( including the boxed )\n\nThere are many other good Gold Box games released for other systems, but none of them offer the same level of support for the series as this collection does.\n\nFor a detailed explanation and review of the first game please see my review of

{"id":3507,"ended":true,"length":512,"text":"In the early 1940s, many young Puerto Rican men were drafted for World War II, among them Santos. Santos recorded `` Despedida `` ( My Good @ - @ bye ), which became Puerto Rican pop culture's anthem. Although he didn't achieve his dream of being a singer, Santos spent the war working in a munitions factory and also taught English to other soldiers.\n\nIn 1944, Santos returned to Puerto Rico and started singing folkloric music in public with his brother. In 1950, they began singing in salsa clubs, and soon became known as ``Los Tres Santos`` ( The Three Santos ). Santos later opened his own restaurant, and in 1957 he got his act on the air by joining Radio WKAQ.\n\nIn 1965, Santos was a guest on a televised talent show to compete for the `` La Academia de la M\u00fasica `` ( Music Academy ), but a few years earlier he had joined a more popular version of the institution on the popular TV series ``Lola Beltran`` ( Lola ).\n\nSantos married a local radio actress known as ``Lady`` Luisa Santos, who was a member of the singing group ``La Chirridisima ``. Both he and the group were quite popular.\n\nOn April 9, 1965, the couple went to Puerto Rico's famous Plaza de la Cultura Tropical for an `` El Cari\u00f1o de Santo Domingo`` ( `` The Cari\u00f1o of Santo Domingo`` ) show. There, Santos' song `` Despedida`` ( My Good @ - @ bye ) won first place and he was voted `` Hijo M\u00e1s Popular Nuestro`` ( The Most Popular of Our Hombres`` ). In the following year, Lady Luisa was voted ``La mejor cantautora`` ( The Best Singer ) on the show.\n\nOn February 27, 1968, about 20,000 Santo Domingo fans gathered in the city center for his 65th birthday celebration. He wore a pink suit, and `` Despedida`` ( My Good @ - @ bye ) was performed by his band.

{"id":923,"ended":true,"length":500,"text":"Roads leading out of Mogadishu connect the city to other localities in Somalia as well as to neighbouring countries. The capital itself is cut into several grid layouts by an extensive road network, which have been destroyed in the past.\n\nIn addition to the usual road and rail, Mogadishu has an extensive waterborne transport system that was also destroyed in 1991, following the end of the war.\n\nMogadishu Airport\n\nOne of the main hubs of the country, Mogadishu Airport, located in the east, serves the whole country. It is the largest and most important airport and major business focus of Somalia.\n\nMogadishu port is connected to the sea by an artificial manmade island. A channel of about 1km has been created to enable ships navigate. The construction to this channel began in January 2007.\n\nThe government estimates that about 3,500 ships dock a year at the port.\n\nRoads\n\nRoads in the capital city Mogadishu are in a very bad condition, which has hampered all business. The destruction of the Somalia road network has made it extremely hard to transport goods and services, or even for ordinary people to move themselves and their belongings.\n\nMogadishu airport, located in the east, is one of the hubs of the country\n\nMogadishu is the main transportation hub of Somalia. In addition to the main airport Mogadishu port, another major port is located at Berbido, which is served by Mogadishu\u2019s port but also by roads to other smaller ports.\n\nIt was the primary seaport for the government, UN peacekeeping and the military between 1979 and 1993.\n\nDuring the civil war of Somalia in the mid-1990s, the government was able to maintain control of most of this port, so it was considered a major government target.\n\nWater\n\nMuch of the country\u2019s transport system relies on rivers. From 1991 to 1994 the rivers were the main source of food, fresh water and fuel.\n\nMajority of the roads in Somalia are not accessible as they are full of mines, unexploded ordinance (UXO), land mines and are badly damaged during the civil war. This situation is compounded by flooding caused by the wet season in which most of the Mogadishu area lies.\n\nGovernment efforts to clear these mines and improve the damaged roads are hampered by a lack of funding.\n\nThere is a need to work on water distribution and storage in the country, especially since in a country that receives very little rainfall and where most wells are open channels, water distribution is one of the main challenges.\n\nA new irrigation system that would pump water from the Nile (or another river) to several farms in Mogadishu and surrounding areas is one of the aims of the government.","token_len":583,"entropy":[5.078,9.2024,5.6744,0.7323,10.0972,0.0147,0.0052,12.2254,2.1891,2.5868,1.0986,3.5741,6.068,1.9931,2.3505,1.6138,4.5807,1.4841,0.2849,1.9726,4.1245,1.7614,1.0496,2.5563,4.7484,7.3092,0.6643,8.5876,6.1823,3.9656,9.0838,8.421,3.9903,4.6006,3.9294,3.6342,0.333,1.7978,1.789,6.2156,1.91,5.4591,1.9394,1.0315,1.7289,1.0831,0.719,0.0005,3.0717,2.4705,0.5028,1.0849,6.2057,4.0269,4.1483,0.9,5.4036,3.5104,0.0013,0.0027,1.7099,4.0049,1.552,4.482,7.6401,5.8124,1.2544,2.2986,4.848,4.1076,1.2028,1.0214,6.2011,1.9222,4.9275,1.2815,5.3089,0.0047,0.6077,2.3851,0.5289,1.0739,0.0002,3.1533,0.1624,0.0004,0.0019,5.5113,2.2887,0.0002,5.2173,0.2225,0.1948,1.9983,3.2568,0.5752,1.0112,3.4268,1.8762,0.8927,0.0003,0.0021,1.3292,2.9922,6.4614,0.9283,0.442,4.722,3.2918,3.9045,2.8784,5.4655,1.1797,1.5484,1.6166,0.8109,1.8035,2.1557,2.6821,0.9465,1.9409,0.841,4.4103,6.6866,5.7332,10.8975,0.7941,3.6328,0.9606,1.0108,0.0001,2.0232,0.0705,0.0017,0.0041,8.2369,1.4323,5.199,0.5505,0.8519,5.4416,1.1871,2.8307,5.9467,9.3056,2.1633,3.3529,2.2728,3.8387,7.0911,2.8004,4.778,2.8432,3.1084,4.3387,0.3801,2.892,1.8419,4.9217,4.1709,10.8073,4.8699,1.4431,7.3041,7.2227,3.2369,2.8521,3.1018,0.3646,4.6974,3.5114,1.014,0.7883,0.0001,1.6441,5.6027,6.6649,0.3179,2.8566,3.5669,0.9351,1.7443,3.6975,6.3492,6.3373,2.4704,1.8593,0.6302,1.0193,0.7427,1.5514,0.0001,6.685,0.3346,2.6479,0.0001,2.8062,0.1274,2.7118,2.2592,1.081,4.7847,5.7741,0.0001,0.0022,1.2617,4.9348,2.4924,3.6612,2.7326,1.3019,1.5986,3.2736,2.4327,5.8191,5.5921,5.7938,2.8253,1.8741,8.2772,0.1852,1.4346,9.8024,5.3501,1.1317,1.9095,3.4907,1.0715,2.9732,3.27,0.6972,2.364,0.4747,1.4687,1.5981,2.7801,5.8083,1.7414,5.1952,6.1525,0.7141,0.5992,3.6858,5.9453,1.8418,0.5678,1.1875,0.679,0.5844,0.0002,2.4677,0.3465,0.0022,0.004,2.4314,2.9041,2.6692,0.6157,0.1678,1.7878,0.6237,1.0755,2.0275,0.0234,0.1283,5.7644,0.3442,0.3481,0.537,4.9903,0.0002,1.7053,0.3366,0.0047,0.0046,2.2381,2.0982,2.6254,4.5864,0.265,1.5558,0.9885,1.2348,3.2587,1.6315,0.1574,0.8757,2.2478,2.0254,6.385,0.0006,0.0021,4.9151,1.4033,4.7478,1.5608,2.1352,1.1497,1.1829,2.022,7.6338,9.111,4.7678,1.3217,1.6955,1.0621,6.2772,0.0851,6.8061,0.0049,0.0121,13.7812,7.4778,4.4816,4.2111,7.1882,1.8448,1.123,6.6648,3.2167,1.5731,6.0463,1.8426,1.0846,0.5424,0.0002,5.1277,2.9165,2.6459,5.8458,9.8094,0.0798,0.0223,1.5097,1.2414,3.9818,3.114,8.2236,4.4204,0.8763,1.9422,2.5011,2.1032,5.3347,4.2767,0.1973,3.2326,0.4618,1.3058,0.0002,6.0932,0.433,2.9796,0.0294,3.1994,5.4659,1.5648,1.6815,2.4764,0.2803,0.5841,0.0351,0.1927,1.1292,1.318,3.087,2.1362,0.0099,3.4631,2.6973,0.5704,3.7529,0.5151,5.803,1.3527,1.4385,4.9998,2.2517,1.5731,4.5469,1.2746,1.7111,5.4949,4.8716,0.6665,0.933,0.0002,6.7261,1.1505,0.0001,6.4959,0.1252,0.2994,2.1674,13.3112,0.8851,0.1759,6.896,2.1089,3.3116,0.1379,3.9548,1.9719,6.0876,5.8963,0.721,2.4262,2.7372,3.5359,1.7177,4.3476,0.4693,0.5151,0.0603,3.2757,1.4523,6.4241,0.0792,0.7921,2.3803,0.9168,1.0267,0.0001,6.9325,6.8497,0.0382,0.6781,4.6989,1.0571,1.5522,0.9423,3.8823,4.074,5.4468,1.5292,0.6247,6.3412,0.1169,7.39,0.9286,4.048,0.007,6.2115,2.5398,4.7973,0.4146,1.3327,6.9108,0.5854,0.794,8.7885,6.8442,0.704,4.495,1.2136,2.5828,0.0327,0.2739,4.5139,4.3245,1.5371,2.9771,0.193,7.0667,3.7549,0.0431,1.0994,7.8341,1.7618,3.0461,3.542,3.5213,0.6334,0.103,8.9633,0.0017,0.0156,3.0718,4.5107,0.2285,0.3877,0.0001,5.5586,5.6299,0.4749,4.9622,2.9728,3.2328,1.1665,5.9789,1.7642,8.9476,0.3547,2.0672,3.2214,0.2818,2.8278,0.5999,0.0014,2.7989,1.0006,0.9493,0.0002,4.1967,1.2323,1.3544,4.1076,0.9558,5.3142,1.175,3.7265,4.8447,1.8962,5.6957,2.6695,0.9808,2.0434,1.6544,2.3268,3.451,5.1806,4.7489,2.4129,2.7097,5.5871,5.0665,0.4419,2.0139,2.5502,4.5153,2.759,6.8456,0.4245,4.7869,11.2126,0.9982,2.0047,3.9264,0.87,5.1511,0.0826,0.0349,1.3902,2.6585,0.4767,0.3016,0.0002,4.108,4.0078,4.7443,0.3823,4.2068,4.466,5.6621,0.7188,0.8984,0.7285,3.6316,4.8167,4.4651,5.3132,2.3866,0.4079,1.2529,5.6812,6.133,1.5811,2.4621,0.0001,0.0042,2.8526,5.0476,0.4272,1.2404,4.7546,0.3596,0.068,4.9164,0.1485,0.3242,1.1273,0.4903]}

{"id":1863,"ended":true,"length":499,"text":"As early as the 18th century, fur trappers entered the extreme northern basin of the Missouri River in the hopes of finding populations of beaver and river otter, the sale of whose pelts were highly prized by the early European fur trade. The first detailed records of beaver hunting, including accounts of the trapping, killing, and sale of beaver in southwestern Minnesota, were written in 1827 by James Marshall, a Minnesota-born fur trader who traveled widely in the upper Missouri basin. His journals record the killing and skinning of beaver in Stearns County in 1827 and 1828, but by that time beaver populations had nearly vanished from the upper Missouri basin.\n\nFor several years before Marshall\u2019s arrival, fur traders had relied on beaver and walleye as the principal meats to supplement their diets of moose, elk, caribou, and wolf. By the early 1850s, however, the increasing popularity of deer hunting in the upper Missouri basin (primarily due to the expansion of public land access ) and increasing pressure from commercial fur-trapping companies had led to a sharp decline in the supply of beaver, walleye, and other game. As a result, the Missouri Fur Company\u2019s traders attempted to attract beaver and walleye back into the upper basin by providing bounty payments in the form of skins. When their bounty payments proved ineffective, the fur companies resorted to the use of explosives to kill beaver on a much larger scale.\n\nThe Missouri Fur Company (MFC) also used explosives to kill beaver beginning in the mid-1850s. It appears the MFC\u2019s first beaver blasting operation near the confluence of the Big and Little Brule Rivers was organized by the wintering trappers who accompanied the company\u2019s packers, many of whom regularly killed beaver during the early winter. After the explosion had killed the beaver, the trappers proceeded to skin the carcasses of the animals, which they left to rot. According to a contemporary diary account by John Thomas, one of the trappers accompanying the packs, the MFC\u2019s second beaver-blasting operation was carried out near the confluence of the Big Brule and the North Fork of the Big Sioux in 1859. The ensuing \u201ccacophony of death\u201d produced by the explosion \u201cwas heard all at once\u201d and, because of the distance between the location of the killing and the wintering encampment, much of the sound was inaudible even to Thomas, who was some miles away. At that time, the MFC had few beaver in the valley, and the only practical reason that the company would spend the necessary time and effort to blast beaver in the middle of winter was to obtain skins for the upcoming trade season.","token_len":584,"entropy":[7.5466,0.1019,2.1722,5.0864,0.3983,0.0954,0.2469,8.9468,4.8717,0.1586,7.6187,1.03,9.569,2.167,8.8704,0.2738,1.1165,7.0378,0.4017,2.9371,1.4129,3.6025,0.0885,1.6468,9.2025,0.655,7.4558,0.8511,1.3618,6.5228,1.6892,0.4251,1.8951,3.7487,11.6969,0.2086,7.2175,6.7448,0.0053,1.7447,6.2258,0.3403,2.2274,1.8159,5.0857,5.4225,5.0101,1.2002,0.3006,2.085,3.3239,9.0896,2.673,0.2587,3.4676,0.3284,2.6984,3.1523,5.0842,5.8926,0.4305,2.1889,6.8433,3.1193,9.6508,0.6669,0.225,4.2188,0.1142,2.0434,0.2785,2.6795,6.7743,3.4216,1.1766,1.2545,3.2239,0.7934,1.0751,4.4135,0.9263,4.4655,7.5087,1.0263,1.0517,4.0095,3.0375,0.8161,2.7204,1.4218,1.392,4.5605,4.7287,1.9201,0.9175,5.9912,2.3441,4.1181,0.8637,3.7336,6.5427,4.0657,1.4434,4.0676,1.3096,9.6584,0.1725,0.0655,1.1976,0.3884,1.7205,5.5747,6.775,0.0091,1.2718,2.2825,0.6357,2.2787,1.8759,0.7797,0.572,0.812,2.3924,4.9517,2.8531,0.1582,5.0761,0.5678,2.8157,0.5519,6.45,3.4979,1.3779,0.9822,4.7406,0.489,1.2562,0.4317,1.5259,0.0009,4.9389,3.5929,0.7397,3.6621,3.6076,15.211,8.4688,2.8471,3.4844,0.8706,4.0204,2.602,2.5104,4.7288,0.5782,3.2532,0.3922,3.7685,5.6669,1.5942,0.0012,2.0715,2.6343,6.2046,6.9017,3.7953,4.4236,0.5322,2.6268,2.5142,7.7503,0.0153,0.9464,3.4838,0.008,0.0217,7.6084,0.1245,0.0008,0.0628,0.6913,5.1459,0.6567,3.5175,1.2166,2.2384,2.9009,0.0554,0.2177,1.6918,0.0011,1.3861,6.9474,2.4276,0.0501,4.8113,2.1061,1.7651,0.917,2.3268,0.1206,0.6105,6.2037,5.5477,0.0032,4.7283,0.0084,0.7324,6.0922,0.078,7.6183,2.6432,4.0374,8.986,1.9384,5.4333,5.1061,1.1622,4.3839,3.2888,3.1528,2.1526,2.3077,2.2751,3.7439,2.0673,0.446,1.2874,3.9338,0.7774,0.0998,1.1353,5.154,0.0673,1.2048,0.0832,2.5918,3.6716,0.0034,0.0038,0.0411,0.1924,1.4288,4.9218,1.9221,3.2414,1.5399,0.0898,0.1632,1.3662,4.8876,4.8075,3.6226,5.7088,0.446,0.02,7.2155,5.7015,0.0991,6.0791,3.274,0.247,1.4524,0.4039,0.0034,0.0048,5.5822,1.1568,0.6611,2.6224,5.9099,1.9544,5.2139,7.454,5.9411,3.1643,2.0894,0.188,0.0008,5.7717,2.6668,4.8625,5.3657,4.7661,1.3543,6.0292,4.5795,0.2545,1.0559,2.0743,3.3713,3.4469,0.0185,2.8737,1.7941,0.0043,6.1309,1.1087,2.0963,1.7482,0.3,5.2469,2.4411,3.6295,0.7541,0.0142,0.4663,1.1209,0.0002,1.8353,4.2392,0.4932,0.051,4.9621,0.6493,1.5188,0.1926,4.1915,3.2926,1.9479,0.4652,0.696,1.2164,0.1159,9.413,0.1345,1.0953,2.8674,0.2378,0.6356,1.4845,0.0073,0.7358,3.719,6.0756,4.0777,2.2157,0.0254,6.9222,0.0214,0.0061,2.5678,6.3746,0.0197,12.2413,3.4058,7.9399,1.9398,6.6762,0.0023,0.0221,0.6057,5.8279,2.9595,1.021,10.0903,4.3582,2.0863,1.7794,5.0258,1.1111,2.3537,9.3138,2.8478,7.3269,0.3264,3.2367,5.6963,1.2742,3.8733,5.2953,0.0539,0.004,6.0195,2.1676,3.8046,6.0117,0.1619,0.0933,7.4911,4.1727,0.9632,0.213,3.8288,1.5563,2.8406,2.2617,0.8427,4.618,1.194,5.2108,6.0031,2.3068,2.7304,1.6064,0.1092,0.7619,0.7822,1.5335,0.1113,4.2373,0.1464,9.8937,1.0548,2.2787,0.5118,0.9522,1.3034,2.8876,1.8717,2.3961,1.7004,5.0866,1.7965,3.1997,3.2336,5.0944,0.0011,2.1169,6.8586,6.9435,4.0328,2.1776,2.5606,6.0231,1.0626,2.4622,0.3744,0.1526,2.0019,0.036,8.5819,0.6631,7.7468,1.1135,2.2146,2.6452,0.0357,1.5569,0.0034,0.0125,5.2741,1.1862,0.0032,4.5794,5.0619,0.0786,0.1934,1.3066,3.0083,0.0153,3.2372,0.5742,0.8487,0.0011,0.0155,0.19,1.0047,2.4784,0.0005,0.9097,2.1395,6.5038,1.2349,1.4415,0.2011,2.2658,6.1171,6.0284,1.1188,3.5295,0.3581,1.4733,5.8914,14.8006,5.6175,5.2852,7.1278,1.1942,0.0652,2.3233,5.8339,4.2045,7.0053,5.249,2.2642,0.6116,4.3773,6.3523,0.7143,2.2822,6.8435,4.7425,7.1851,0.0142,4.708,2.1515,1.47,3.4381,5.3692,0.7872,0.6417,6.6327,1.5543,0.2251,6.4382,0.3768,0.1533,6.0489,1.2531,0.3051,9.6686,0.0639,6.2061,0.4005,0.2856,5.8906,0.3258,0.1159,4.8192,0.9966,6.1429,0.0725,0.0059,6.4294,0.712,10.3706,2.4797,0.3189,1.8885,8.6525,5.0362,0.8935,0.4805,4.5288,3.0177,0.5131,0.3972,1.371,2.3096,0.0207,4.1708,6.4884,3.7148,0.3434,4.258,1.3715,5.2159,1.1399,1.0111,1.895,3.7791,7.6178,6.3727,4.1604,1.7389,2.5659,3.2955,6.3196,2.473,5.5088,1.3941,2.2048,1.9437,0.9651,9.0694,1.2609,0.1201,3.0563,0.7214,4.1829,0.0303,3.1716,0.2214,0.5735,3.7781,6.5319,1.1206,1.1689,7.1328,8.5065,2.7276,0.239]}
{"id":2002,"ended":true,"length":523,"text":"The Ghats in Varanasi are world @ - @ renowned embankments made in steps of stone slabs along the river bank where pilgrims perform ritual ablutions. The ghats are an integral complement to the temples that surround them. As one ghat after another gets a makeover -- including being turned into parks, sports grounds, tourist venues, or just dumped into the river -- another awaits its fate as well.\n\nBut this being India, no one seems too perturbed about all this.\n\nThe ancient Benares, one of the oldest Hindu centers in this part of India, is one of the holiest places and attracts millions every year. But it's now increasingly getting polluted as industrial pollution is increasing and the number of cars on the roads is too great.\n\nSo it was a great chance for me to witness not only people but their homes and places of work and worship at a scale rarely seen outside big cities. I photographed the world in all its diversity, but I focused on the people too.\n\nThe city has been built over a period of 2,000 years. That's a lot of history and life that has gone into this place. As the British built their own cities of industrial and colonial exploitation, they also built their own monuments in the world's oldest city.\n\nSo I got to enjoy them -- some for the history and beauty, some more as beautiful art installations, some just as beautiful because it allowed me to breathe in the sights, sounds and smells of being a traveller in Varanasi.\n\nWhile I was working, I also got to see other amazing scenes as well.\n\nYou can also see that image-processing work (such as cropping, adding the right frame and so on) that I do here.\n\n\"The Ghats\"\n\nThis project is named after the Ghats in Varanasi, India.\n\nThey are world renowned as the epicenter for the ancient ritual of Kumbh, where the rivers of India flow together to form a common sea of spirituality.\n\nKumbh is a Hindu festival and the world's largest religious gathering. It takes place once every 12 years and in the ancient Hindu calendar, this is considered the age of Aquarius.\n\nOn the banks of the river, one can see hundreds of millions of pilgrims from across the world as they perform rituals and offerings for the gods.\n\nAs with other cultures all over the world, Kumbh plays a role in the culture of India and the world and its traditions and beliefs remain very strong within it in a way that can be seen nowhere else.\n\nWhile the city is getting more polluted everyday, its surroundings remain unchanged. In the Hindu calendar, we move into the Age of Aquarius this year, making 2012 an interesting time to shoot a work in such a place as Varanasi.","token_len":585,"entropy":[10.5813,4.534,4.6198,8.498,0.033,0.0043,2.039,9.5927,14.2374,9.2799,5.403,11.5543,11.8128,2.1921,1.1691,6.8008,2.0872,13.4056,1.196,4.1148,9.1707,0.0501,6.1454,0.9194,2.7073,4.6543,4.7577,5.2069,6.0367,3.8628,3.4764,0.3435,1.3494,2.6229,4.2386,0.0201,1.1772,4.4006,2.2933,12.4481,0.2152,0.8486,5.1538,3.8824,3.2657,0.9987,0.6496,5.0806,4.3332,5.6757,3.3174,8.2076,0.0937,6.0706,4.9719,8.1729,0.2094,8.2619,4.6571,6.0237,5.1739,0.4444,11.9014,1.096,5.2393,4.5052,0.4721,5.4851,5.0547,0.7142,4.7322,4.2159,9.0802,1.294,0.925,0.6572,0.772,7.1681,7.1878,2.5831,4.7242,3.6997,1.686,0.1227,1.2727,0.0164,4.6891,3.5991,7.4668,1.7551,0.1883,4.6415,0.8168,3.6815,3.8044,5.588,0.0002,1.9924,4.963,0.9978,0.6632,1.9334,0.0002,2.745,6.5822,10.6873,0.4087,2.7657,4.2816,0.0604,0.3153,1.7726,3.0794,5.8308,0.5012,5.8209,1.6268,0.0042,1.5484,0.2165,1.2215,2.9632,0.1414,0.2938,3.6038,0.6802,5.2804,6.3614,3.6784,3.0049,0.039,0.5417,2.7767,2.6502,1.2796,4.9567,7.1579,5.1346,6.3938,3.1389,7.3547,2.138,3.0466,3.1777,2.0744,1.732,4.2663,0.0323,5.9465,2.3907,0.373,0.8484,1.3725,6.2959,2.6814,1.2123,1.2026,0.0002,3.8095,3.368,3.1193,2.4764,4.5564,5.0712,1.0179,2.8687,0.1552,5.4166,7.7504,0.7893,7.0526,3.8943,4.3029,3.9323,1.9182,3.567,1.1903,4.7044,2.967,2.4608,4.0757,2.6538,6.9169,4.7359,0.1673,3.7174,8.0084,0.2788,0.9426,2.4629,6.8161,1.6193,6.8301,3.9349,3.2612,0.0933,4.1806,1.3612,2.9292,2.1163,6.682,0.5628,1.1067,3.2353,6.3912,0.4646,0.7584,0.0001,2.5571,4.4749,3.4273,1.985,5.0772,3.4942,2.1959,3.153,0.0656,4.6262,0.2981,0.623,0.026,1.4988,4.8613,0.7521,2.6236,2.8347,0.2255,3.3354,2.3318,5.6754,3.6959,2.2984,2.847,2.0768,2.4286,1.3054,0.4619,4.866,2.2848,7.0231,4.4765,1.9153,3.6346,2.8844,3.836,7.3798,2.5935,4.6422,5.8988,0.6529,1.5626,2.8928,1.0601,1.7224,0.1542,5.0511,3.859,1.1597,5.7678,0.5271,2.1417,1.9311,0.6801,0.7153,0.0002,3.8798,1.8858,4.2495,0.7443,5.1965,4.922,4.2793,4.934,4.2793,1.9975,5.4129,1.7508,5.0567,1.1942,0.5832,5.7626,2.8227,6.8854,6.104,4.4832,1.8764,0.8689,4.2157,2.6673,1.89,5.8278,2.6953,6.4068,0.3834,0.0611,6.9411,2.6954,0.727,6.454,2.2298,2.26,0.9377,0.6975,0.7694,6.9347,2.6507,6.7626,1.5617,2.7657,0.0006,0.0071,0.2938,0.3417,0.0002,5.3956,1.5328,1.0624,5.0015,1.9353,0.6745,3.638,2.1884,0.5777,1.6335,4.8597,4.8477,5.3587,3.8199,0.6134,0.5165,1.5271,0.0001,4.8221,0.6932,3.2596,1.6055,4.5199,8.8127,7.0804,7.044,4.9234,6.0936,5.7856,0.0035,5.9837,0.003,1.5489,5.3392,5.0356,4.1898,6.5094,1.9008,3.8813,0.1595,0.2323,2.8986,2.8885,4.0986,3.1143,1.3856,1.1127,0.0001,5.6579,2.7402,4.0391,0.0161,2.6512,2.1599,0.0001,3.4117,4.7721,1.429,5.8605,0.2674,0.8383,2.8944,0.0486,1.1387,0.5498,0.0005,0.0115,1.225,4.5308,0.8686,1.8528,0.0001,3.7245,0.687,5.6207,2.2355,3.846,1.7987,4.8582,0.3078,2.4904,1.8183,3.7025,4.2832,0.9935,6.9867,3.7607,0.5052,4.0778,4.2007,1.703,7.4154,2.3081,2.2197,2.508,3.7529,2.0914,1.0829,1.6715,6.8003,5.5963,3.265,8.4824,0.6975,0.8051,0.0001,4.0226,0.0028,0.0022,0.7177,1.6156,3.0905,1.7192,3.5306,2.1083,4.883,0.6324,1.5986,4.1679,3.1383,1.2416,1.5963,2.7752,0.0053,5.1889,0.7457,4.2418,1.1848,2.4363,4.272,2.1733,4.1262,2.8959,3.3798,1.187,4.1683,1.6578,3.8329,0.9702,5.6032,0.2756,7.3854,0.2737,0.5711,0.4497,0.0001,4.9847,1.4069,4.1918,0.0081,0.1073,1.0749,0.817,4.5686,1.3444,0.7747,5.211,0.0499,5.3252,0.1117,2.7175,3.6052,1.9794,0.5934,0.4967,5.2556,0.3037,2.8182,1.9544,1.9008,5.0473,2.9567,0.8153,1.9824,0.8398,0.5686,0.0001,3.9812,4.9304,3.1145,6.942,5.077,0.1122,0.4496,0.0515,0.0775,4.4926,0.0016,0.0015,7.0596,0.4807,2.4187,0.1738,1.2312,4.057,0.6228,2.0412,2.339,1.9697,2.3716,5.2322,3.8138,3.835,2.1597,2.8771,7.0604,3.3469,2.9932,5.8624,2.312,5.4857,2.3982,0.9641,0.2107,4.1424,0.9027,1.4339,7.7204,0.058,0.854,0.131,0.0001,4.9095,1.8961,3.8122,1.2815,5.9942,4.3585,0.1574,8.2066,0.3602,3.8561,6.467,3.7798,5.3013,0.6965,3.8699,1.9844,5.9013,4.519,0.2952,4.2901,6.5005,3.5198,0.9711,8.1726,0.0136,0.9585,0.0099,6.7409,0.5987,1.5915,4.8554,9.273,3.1604,4.3023,2.6145,0.9079,8.1251,2.6753,7.9337,1.9203,8.614,0.5056,3.0566,2.7657,0.6965,0.001,0.0058,0.1609]}

{"id":4353,"ended":true,"length":513,"text":"Singapore took the position that Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge should be considered a single group of maritime features as Middle Rocks and South Ledge were dependencies of Pedra Branca. It considered that the islands should be included in the territory of Singapore, and Middle Rocks and South Ledge were included within the territorial waters of Singapore.\n\nContents\n\nMiddle Rocks and South Ledge were historically uninhabited, being surrounded by waters of the Strait of Malacca. The two rocks were named after their position, Middle Rocks, and South Ledge, [1] as the largest land feature on the island.\n\nIn 1795, both Middle Rocks and South Ledge were claimed by the U.K. as part of the British Raj, whereupon Middle and South Ledge were annexed to the Straits Settlement. Middle Rocks was incorporated into the Straits Settlement as a separate government settlement with separate courts established to administer the land. South Ledge was incorporated into the British Territory of Sarawak.\n\nIn 1959, both Middle Rocks and South Ledge were designated as being part of Singapore. [2] On February 5, 1973, South Ledge was transferred to Malaysia as part of negotiations and Singapore retained ownership of Middle Rocks. In the same year, Singapore and Malaysia reached a settlement where Middle Rocks was given to Malaysia while South Ledge was returned to Singapore. [1][3][4]\n\nIn 1974, Singapore applied for a United Nations Treaty on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) [5] which allowed countries to extend their territorial waters to 12 nautical miles.\n\nMiddle Rocks and South Ledge were both included within a proposed territorial group called the \"Middle Rocks\u2013South Ledge Archipelago Area\". In the same year, Malaysia proposed this area to be excluded from the proposed area. Singapore subsequently agreed with Malaysia to exclude the islands under a bilateral agreement. [1][2][3]\n\nMiddle Rocks and South Ledge were designated as Singapore EEZ for the purpose of UNCLOS. However, the islands were not designated as Singapore EEZ in actuality.\n\nWhen Singapore submitted its 10-year review of UNCLOS on behalf of the Middle Rocks\u2013South Ledge Archipelago Area, it claimed that the territory would be included in Singapore's EEZ. [6] However, an opinion of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) was submitted in 2008, that Middle Rocks and South Ledge cannot considered an area within the EEZ of any country and are therefore international in character and should be considered international waters. [1][7][8]\n\nMiddle Rocks and South Ledge are not part of the territorial sea of any country and therefore the area of 12 nautical miles was not extended to the islands under the current interpretation of UNCLOS by the PCA.","token_len":585,"entropy":[10.4485,7.5973,1.989,5.4393,1.2828,12.8019,4.1151,8.9784,4.2514,1.6597,11.1187,14.5792,2.7881,4.976,5.4173,2.7781,2.8606,0.7023,3.0311,3.2643,4.5646,5.8677,1.346,9.0788,3.7268,4.0916,10.9453,0.1008,1.5351,0.2152,0.0564,0.0003,2.5677,12.1462,0.5287,7.1199,0.007,0.38,0.0001,1.0523,3.8028,6.1047,1.4146,1.5412,4.4318,2.015,0.3748,3.9544,0.7918,0.698,6.4155,0.665,1.4251,1.8346,1.8406,7.8491,0.0264,0.5601,0.0401,0.0041,0.0002,1.7689,4.1169,3.2723,0.7108,2.6778,2.5129,0.2007,0.2951,0.3558,1.4137,0.002,8.4184,2.5074,0.0002,6.7061,0.0792,0.6041,0.0539,0.0113,0.0002,3.6453,7.7747,7.9186,0.0022,0.071,2.4854,5.6057,4.5294,0.1117,4.5159,1.4582,1.8393,5.8304,0.0523,0.3324,0.0015,1.1282,1.616,4.5196,7.122,1.2374,4.4509,1.5339,3.2647,5.478,3.2787,3.3023,0.0728,3.7007,0.981,0.1396,0.0037,0.0004,1.4317,8.8149,2.0008,0.5512,3.2835,2.2855,7.4502,5.9863,6.7903,1.9706,0.5608,1.5077,1.0708,1.6138,0.0001,2.9534,3.3209,4.3219,0.3646,6.6465,1.6693,0.0297,0.0422,0.0437,0.0047,0.0003,0.32,4.7927,0.1952,1.0607,5.6808,0.1833,3.5063,0.5283,3.4139,0.9461,0.0011,0.7196,1.5316,6.3011,1.5469,4.0897,6.0631,6.3783,5.1141,0.1656,0.077,0.0007,0.4438,3.6055,1.3509,0.7568,9.0236,0.0007,7.8255,1.0458,4.0383,0.7986,1.8578,4.7813,0.3903,0.4476,2.6732,0.0013,0.158,2.9473,1.1447,2.9695,5.5613,6.0976,4.8768,6.3692,5.2259,6.4132,2.6637,2.9248,0.6936,2.477,0.9434,1.6285,0.0283,0.0003,0.5626,1.0846,0.6372,0.1727,1.9881,5.1408,2.2853,8.4899,0.1953,0.0006,2.5579,0.6104,0.0001,1.6482,6.1067,0.1285,3.8668,0.3662,0.7685,0.0214,0.0306,0.0035,0.0001,0.1694,3.7078,0.7374,4.695,0.972,0.0017,1.4836,1.1309,3.8705,0.157,0.0275,4.2461,3.627,3.3608,0.055,5.1965,0.1172,3.7764,0.0465,0.0003,0.7826,3.9233,0.3237,4.447,2.719,0.6174,0.0004,6.2936,5.1379,4.682,5.607,5.2447,0.2724,1.2243,0.0638,1.5079,3.0643,3.4637,3.3087,0.3165,0.1281,2.3205,4.0044,0.3783,6.3496,1.3868,2.223,5.2681,2.91,0.4191,1.0458,3.6255,1.4202,0.7195,5.6464,0.3388,0.0046,0.0003,0.2129,4.3041,0.1184,0.6805,0.4938,2.6418,4.1517,3.9095,0.2692,1.7302,0.0495,0.2588,0.5343,0.0001,1.5212,4.2379,0.1631,1.9609,6.3616,0.6019,1.7039,5.1423,0.1548,5.2711,1.6644,0.8387,3.5457,0.0716,0.2759,0.0759,1.375,0.7075,4.5525,0.0564,0.5106,4.0094,0.0743,0.2329,1.8261,4.5787,6.601,0.5569,5.4497,0.8189,1.7363,1.7395,1.2504,7.7611,1.9778,0.0001,0.0075,2.0181,2.8665,0.0001,4.3531,0.1725,0.6509,0.0455,0.0022,0.0001,0.7378,4.4823,4.4437,2.0561,2.9413,5.2922,4.5685,5.1894,2.4559,0.7791,3.659,4.3971,3.0371,8.6142,1.0462,0.125,0.0012,7.5452,0.004,0.0106,3.572,1.3879,3.015,2.35,4.9691,0.1824,0.1408,1.4396,4.0966,6.5781,2.3047,1.4306,1.7105,7.0275,0.0875,0.4898,4.0678,4.3389,2.0047,4.0719,4.1161,3.018,2.8124,0.3255,1.3998,4.3214,2.4348,2.4488,5.4955,2.6947,5.2206,1.0658,1.2697,2.5541,3.1809,1.0003,0.928,1.3056,0.8723,0.5189,0.3856,0.0001,3.0604,0.1622,0.2844,0.0326,0.0013,0.0001,0.4985,3.5522,0.4655,6.9408,10.7579,0.0806,5.1647,1.3416,2.3031,0.0139,7.4265,0.0655,0.0055,1.0585,3.6072,0.0271,1.9378,3.0241,0.8043,1.3248,3.524,0.4252,2.3586,0.4386,0.001,3.0368,9.1819,0.1274,1.3404,1.6391,0.0001,5.8606,2.1492,4.5457,1.5934,8.573,1.0021,0.3498,5.9913,0.632,7.068,0.0087,0.0071,3.6199,6.3183,0.0014,1.4754,6.4686,0.0559,2.7004,0.006,0.0023,0.0005,0.4857,0.0004,0.0079,0.087,0.6064,1.6043,4.6009,0.6256,1.2121,5.2074,2.9941,0.759,3.0401,1.1731,3.7983,1.5699,0.8194,0.001,1.3413,2.4252,1.6008,0.2335,1.2664,0.0228,5.4917,5.8987,1.891,0.6944,2.4385,0.3993,0.1098,0.0204,0.0003,1.4847,0.6861,0.1728,0.1675,4.8338,3.6146,2.0736,4.5312,2.4856,4.1672,5.1565,0.0562,0.3919,0.0118,0.0013,0.0003,7.2882,11.1479,4.6808,3.0641,2.7025,0.829,1.1904,0.0016,2.6263,3.9478,1.9689,3.0907,4.3446,1.6604,7.9568,4.419,4.4953,2.4748,3.463,0.8393,1.7023,4.0766,2.4955,0.5954,1.5052,2.5541,0.8254,2.1283,1.6243,0.0519,0.2169,0.4679,0.0001,2.682,0.0599,0.1666,0.0076,0.0013,0.0002,2.2583,2.9861,1.8494,0.0009,0.7483,5.0167,4.7863,2.0245,4.2389,0.4555,1.8842,2.1049,3.4123,3.4217,2.0049,8.2693,0.2402,0.0001,0.0127,3.8786,1.0266,7.2783,0.5489,2.0083,3.0041,2.0418,1.2925,5.3607,6.4738,0.4551,1.0882,0.0015,0.0081,5.218,1.9227,5.6829,0.0055,0.3611]}
{"id":3433,"ended":false,"length":555,"text":"ESPN first introduced a TV Everywhere @ - @ like concept with ESPN360, a service which allowed users to stream sports programming from its networks either live or on @ - @ demand through their cable subscriptions on the Web. The company says it has a distribution deal with \"most, if not all, of the distributors in the top 10 markets,\" so it's up and running in those communities. It's now being rolled out more widely with the hope of making it available not just on the Web but also to users' iPhone, iPad, and Android devices.\n\nThis is part of Disney's wider efforts to get programming to all devices, both new and old, as part of its ongoing efforts to build a \"new media company.\" It recently launched the video on-demand service Hulu Plus as well as a partnership with Netflix. The goal is to move away from its traditional distribution model, which relies on offering a \"TV Everywhere\" service to consumers in which they are forced to obtain the content by buying a cable subscription in addition to subscribing to that provider's offerings.\n\nIn announcing the new initiative today, ESPN President John Skipper took a shot at the existing model. \"We wanted to try to do this for a TV Everywhere offering for consumers, but unfortunately have been blocked by the existing cable delivery system,\" he said, according to a Reuters report.\n\nIn addition to an iPhone app, ESPN360 will also support streaming from the iPad and Android phones. ESPN is also rolling out its new app to the Xbox 360 and set-top box, but for now it's only available to Comcast subscribers.\n\nYou can also still stream ESPN-plus content (such as live sports, highlights, full game replays, and fantasy hockey) live from your favorite sports leagues directly to your PC.\n\nThere had been talk at last year's CES about ESPN experimenting with live streaming some of its sporting events. While there had been some progress with that effort, nothing came of it. We weren\u2019t aware of the ESPN360 service until this morning, although it has been listed on the company site for a few weeks.\n\n\"The new service marks a paradigm shift for consumers accustomed to buying a traditional cable bundle with dozens of premium channels to get all the games they want,\" said Mike Levinthal, vice president and director of broadband product management for ESPN. \"With ESPN360, fans can access thousands of games all at the touch of a button, anytime they want--without the need to pay or subscribe to pay-per-view or other add-on services.\"\n\nThe first sports game you'll be able to access is the NBA All-Star Game from New Orleans. In the next few days we hope that you\u2019ll also be able to watch MLB Opening Day, the NBA season opener, the Masters golf tournament, the Stanley Cup, Wimbledon and much, much more.\"","token_len":587,"entropy":[7.7003,5.9267,2.844,6.3769,9.3738,13.001,9.2347,6.3278,8.5153,7.2236,3.1383,5.8451,8.1517,2.7216,3.2935,4.2727,3.1756,4.613,1.6277,0.0779,2.5983,2.5788,4.9648,1.6438,5.4614,5.2239,8.4144,2.4095,0.2998,0.8596,11.4698,3.2881,2.0491,9.5602,5.3596,3.1106,4.4967,5.5441,4.9322,2.3194,4.6914,0.4277,1.9632,3.2723,3.4454,1.115,2.2845,3.679,7.4043,2.7451,0.1829,6.6201,5.6112,6.0814,0.3814,0.0008,0.0071,1.5182,0.8935,0.5604,7.6897,2.2103,0.4648,6.5839,1.8741,1.7502,2.4202,4.0939,1.6757,1.7108,4.9236,6.1118,0.3369,2.732,3.2871,6.6969,0.6415,3.7426,1.3717,4.4215,4.5655,2.6424,0.0372,5.813,1.0744,4.2755,2.5519,6.6012,0.6097,3.0017,1.3194,2.3352,7.2487,0.9748,2.1177,1.6369,1.0802,1.0242,2.1705,3.5126,5.4806,3.8871,6.175,0.9675,0.5525,0.8582,0.9995,0.5837,0.3893,0.4652,0.6479,0.0003,4.2563,1.5342,4.6513,0.0256,8.6079,0.2245,5.7017,2.8344,0.1074,3.5164,6.4736,2.3944,4.9392,5.7798,1.3091,4.5126,3.9223,0.0488,0.3758,0.718,2.9919,2.248,0.0012,1.0334,3.1889,1.8781,0.0498,3.1422,1.1927,3.923,3.0107,2.3208,5.5124,1.0078,2.9485,4.7348,2.4819,1.9884,5.2004,4.6771,1.7654,0.0254,0.8999,4.054,1.3112,4.0817,1.1208,0.4564,1.9328,4.4687,0.0375,3.5486,2.0123,2.3787,6.0221,0.5425,0.19,5.2132,3.9706,0.0013,4.3002,1.0834,5.1843,0.409,1.4267,1.1073,2.5034,0.2034,5.0874,2.1156,4.1827,6.0062,0.079,0.3433,1.4144,1.4058,2.3326,3.3903,5.1204,1.8282,3.5067,3.3185,0.0413,8.7634,3.1711,2.5443,3.9506,3.7416,1.4549,3.0293,1.0602,4.8219,4.0057,0.002,5.7398,0.2986,6.201,4.5321,0.7788,5.546,0.368,0.8549,0.0002,3.2547,6.307,0.5161,1.8094,5.134,4.4298,0.1753,5.4988,4.3534,2.8411,0.0529,0.0132,6.4258,1.9014,2.2425,0.051,1.0298,5.4648,2.2396,2.0474,0.7249,1.3691,4.8682,0.1213,4.6576,1.0498,3.404,4.0093,3.3569,1.7285,5.6989,0.9502,5.3633,4.0905,3.1126,1.5831,2.0594,4.93,7.4099,2.6805,5.1521,1.0041,1.6818,5.084,3.023,6.3881,2.0172,0.6904,0.5131,0.2748,2.8815,2.0544,0.0017,2.0762,6.8878,0.1772,0.25,1.6582,0.0002,3.3224,2.0212,0.3578,5.3994,4.8516,2.2339,0.7595,1.6948,6.7764,1.1779,1.1569,4.607,3.534,3.7272,2.2528,4.0566,1.5656,2.0276,3.9521,1.7148,3.3419,2.9409,1.1375,3.6815,0.0155,2.1621,2.3192,3.1918,3.2882,2.0868,3.7363,1.0615,1.2156,10.4362,1.0787,0.0036,0.9806,2.4319,4.422,4.1294,1.1579,1.5689,0.668,1.7134,0.5014,1.7166,7.3479,1.1921,0.4566,0.9935,0.0002,5.4375,0.1769,3.1176,6.8073,2.5287,1.7053,5.7226,7.4198,1.4524,5.7724,2.681,0.0017,3.5751,1.7503,1.7752,4.7579,0.278,7.2683,3.9174,5.2248,0.0001,0.2219,0.7524,7.3003,3.7254,0.5783,6.4956,1.7116,1.867,3.6273,2.5251,5.2615,5.2674,1.4088,0.5389,3.6454,1.9724,1.6264,0.0002,4.4522,7.8091,0.1791,3.2592,3.9576,3.598,0.6328,0.0023,3.5745,1.9323,2.7048,9.5423,0.0297,3.125,1.7196,8.0444,2.9317,0.4241,6.3533,1.1737,1.4471,4.1906,2.925,3.6758,0.1417,2.0046,5.0971,2.6194,1.6707,4.1184,0.3924,6.563,3.6526,0.2393,0.1789,0.7941,5.6652,5.7729,16.7309,7.4644,1.1201,4.6014,0.2954,2.4435,3.2588,1.4159,3.2328,1.5975,3.0195,3.2073,0.9809,4.6442,1.7011,2.9732,0.9137,4.9527,1.3711,0.9931,0.9222,6.3249,2.5747,1.56,1.3285,1.5014,1.4654,0.9827,0.0002,3.8985,2.6124,4.4501,2.2984,6.9043,0.9642,5.8322,0.0131,0.8655,7.3007,8.3466,0.0051,5.449,2.8215,4.7397,1.0894,3.309,3.4109,7.8354,0.1378,6.0424,1.0437,3.5949,3.1169,3.2622,1.1542,3.8119,1.6736,0.4933,1.5147,1.1917,4.3087,6.9224,6.2888,0.2573,2.1151,0.0093,2.2823,5.4911,0.0956,7.3297,5.4143,2.3674,1.4003,0.4712,0.8285,0.3065,2.4276,1.2508,0.7414,0.4656,4.8622,0.7785,3.4336,5.8803,0.0292,2.3249,5.2223,1.1982,2.5865,7.9971,0.0394,0.056,0.1056,1.1766,6.1314,2.1426,0.3007,7.9085,3.7048,2.1314,1.0652,0.8453,1.8372,5.218,3.8555,0.6255,2.8652,0.4145,0.84,0.0017,0.07,2.4747,3.6044,5.2806,0.0237,0.8892,1.7033,0.888,0.3991,0.0002,2.3572,4.7459,5.601,3.8858,4.8099,1.3864,2.1863,0.1019,0.0125,3.4079,1.9827,1.146,2.7401,1.7575,0.0266,0.0078,0.1267,2.4904,5.8681,0.9202,1.8648,3.8233,2.1871,4.3747,1.2032,1.0072,3.8057,5.2027,3.1494,3.0408,15.22,0.3372,0.8307,2.0411,0.807,0.0164,0.0115,1.0466,4.6621,8.8295,0.6954,2.5748,2.3538,1.7666,8.1797,1.1317,1.8496,1.4714,6.6178,4.7623,0.3903,0.1809,1.4945,5.8635,0.0038,3.146,5.6099,0.0001,2.1608,4.2213,2.4013,0.0116,0.0295,5.4206]}
{"id":712,"ended":false,"length":502,"text":"Both RedOctane and Harmonix experienced changes in 2006. RedOctane was bought by Activision in June \u2014 who spent US $ 100 million to acquire the Guitar Hero franchise \u2014 while it was announced in May that Harmonix received a US $ 25.5 million investment from Electronic Arts.\n\nIn a letter to community, Harmonix co-founder Alex Rigopulos, revealed that the game development company is now under a new management structure.\n\n\"With the help of our Board of Directors, we are working through a strategic process to define the business goals for the company as we look to accelerate growth,\" Rigopulos wrote. \"After evaluating potential funding and reorganizing our operations, we are in the process of executing changes that will support increased growth and create a more efficient company structure.\"\n\nRigopulos then stated that the restructuring has \"no impact whatsoever on our ability to deliver on the development of our games\", but they do plan to use the money to \"invest in the development of our games in areas such as community, business development, marketing, publishing, and other corporate overhead.\"\n\nThe letter also included a list of projects that are or have been in development for Guitar Hero and Dance Central. Most notable is the upcoming Guitar Hero:\n\nGuitar Hero 5 will feature the first Guitar Hero\ngame since Rock Band in 2007.

{"id":1880,"ended":true,"length":492,"text":"At 15 : 15 Lalor left the defence of The Nek to a platoon that had arrived as reinforcements, and moved his company to Baby 700. There he joined a group from the 10th Bde who had dug itself into Baby 800. During the afternoon they attacked Baby 800, but were beaten off, and Lalor was captured.\nSome time later, the 4th Indian Division was surrounded and defeated at Bullecourt, west of the Seine, by General Foy.\nFoy retired through Rouen, and Lalor was again set free. On the 19th, he rejoined the 5th Bde and moved to Tilly and then to St. Valery, which was threatened by French and German troops. General Kitchener sent him and his company to the front on the line to Lille, but he missed the move out and was left stranded at St. Valery. He was forced to go out to Bailleul to get orders for the advance, and had to make his way back through St. Valery. Finally, he arrived at the front near St. Valery shortly before the retirement began.\nFoy's retreat caused heavy casualties for the Indian and French troops in the front line, but the Germans were unable to take Bailleul where General Caudebecke was commanding the reserves.\nOn the 22nd, the 12th Indian Division arrived at the front, although the 4th Indian Division was ordered out on a reconnaissance. While the 12th Indian Division set up positions, the 4th Indian Division was relieved by the 9th Bde, who moved to the left of the 12th Indian Division along the River Seine. The 9th Bde then linked up with the 9th and 12th Indian Divisions in this area, moving into Baby 700 at 16 : 00. Kitchener had to order the 2nd Indian Brigade to join the 9th Bde about midnight, and the 2nd Indian Brigade was formed with the 16th, 39th, 47th and 71st Bde, along with the 4th Indian and 21st Lancers.\nAs the battle developed, the 19th Bde which was still trying to attack Bailleul, was gradually taken aside piecemeal by the advancing German forces. Kitchener was in command, and had to order Caudebecke to retreat into Rouen. However, Caudebecke was in contact with the French General Leclerc's forces, and the French commander refused to surrender until General Haig arrived. This did not take place until 2.00 am on the 23rd, and Caudebecke retired from the front. In the meantime, the Germans had carried out their objectives, the British forces being routed apart from a few isolated battalions. This was the final German victory over the British in France before the Allies were evacuated from the country.","token_len":589,"entropy":[7.5366,8.7322,4.2973,14.7642,3.6539,6.446,1.7059,9.9704,3.9908,6.9224,12.4789,6.5902,4.8865,8.5132,4.814,1.9188,3.1774,5.5451,2.4782,2.655,1.4604,5.8759,3.929,4.0842,1.1324,12.4213,11.636,1.398,4.0317,1.2045,3.9508,2.5965,2.5142,5.1102,1.7352,6.6336,0.2476,5.5058,7.6917,4.1018,1.3036,8.0528,9.3495,1.5235,9.5951,3.9147,1.0182,5.05,0.7094,4.2166,2.9839,3.403,1.0742,0.6662,1.6712,1.3206,2.208,3.7625,4.3405,3.4133,1.0286,4.4006,0.0017,1.5483,2.9003,0.9737,1.5884,8.9131,1.2969,0.3931,1.0233,2.437,4.6293,0.2122,8.0563,2.5936,2.0101,6.3095,2.2757,4.4701,3.4354,6.3877,3.6781,7.9947,1.5515,8.2099,0.0561,2.5877,7.0688,1.7258,1.765,1.0165,5.4493,5.6772,4.9297,1.136,2.1827,4.9826,0.2845,7.7678,7.7296,7.924,0.313,1.5783,1.4125,3.1325,0.002,1.6313,5.4302,7.1339,1.2115,0.9641,3.2767,1.4763,3.6919,0.0211,1.8976,1.7141,5.8636,0.0033,0.7433,3.1691,0.06,2.1334,0.0396,2.4191,3.5609,0.9738,5.3277,6.2008,3.8682,4.24,1.0079,4.8951,0.8427,7.52,3.4908,1.3217,3.8221,1.0997,8.0942,0.3044,4.1313,3.2083,2.8233,1.5332,0.4671,6.7114,10.0372,0.5086,3.9211,3.1134,5.0552,1.1985,1.4801,0.5968,2.0356,3.5461,3.6399,0.8128,7.6651,3.4185,9.6578,2.6841,1.1907,2.2224,1.5686,7.0686,1.4154,4.9669,6.3667,5.1136,1.4182,5.5852,3.9286,2.2931,3.5123,0.1496,1.0968,0.002,0.4797,2.2376,0.9485,4.924,0.1126,4.0078,4.4183,1.5792,4.4606,7.451,2.3028,7.6766,3.2688,3.9349,6.3338,1.2843,1.4771,4.0509,2.4964,1.2507,4.689,0.6056,2.9557,2.8569,0.123,1.3484,3.8401,3.5888,0.0735,0.247,0.0008,1.4319,6.2662,0.8328,1.4405,2.1654,0.6615,2.0378,2.1856,4.9047,2.5331,0.1159,1.2763,0.0012,7.1311,1.1338,2.1229,10.8372,6.2678,0.5386,0.9361,2.7749,0.1634,2.294,5.8525,5.4612,5.4656,0.8857,3.0255,0.6264,4.4921,4.2558,1.8079,1.6194,2.9585,0.5198,1.654,3.6228,0.9593,1.4285,2.0614,4.0662,1.7489,2.8727,0.0076,3.4688,6.3071,0.0448,0.0018,0.0165,5.9334,3.721,5.1505,5.3946,5.6728,5.9364,5.0753,1.8748,6.6509,2.2847,6.5693,0.3701,1.9372,2.6552,0.26,2.7233,0.1406,0.7127,1.7078,4.7193,0.019,2.4697,0.2724,3.6314,0.7656,2.2426,1.255,1.9136,6.2346,2.0523,4.2545,0.0069,2.4799,0.2283,1.1087,5.012,3.4839,2.9033,1.1845,2.1439,2.7362,5.0058,2.154,3.7388,0.0142,1.4365,0.2703,7.5395,1.598,4.4991,2.4691,1.5577,2.5494,0.0098,0.4744,0.1923,2.0554,5.9139,1.1912,1.2824,3.7558,0.0117,1.0568,0.0262,1.5544,1.583,3.2636,1.4515,1.8016,4.6795,1.2823,0.3731,2.0376,0.0045,2.3426,0.1172,5.8331,0.6361,4.3455,3.1906,0.0179,0.6081,1.7584,2.426,0.0033,0.1693,0.0058,2.6989,9.6206,0.075,0.0899,0.5415,2.8698,0.0041,4.5973,4.1932,0.0062,1.6753,0.2113,0.0111,2.2099,6.1832,2.1724,0.871,5.6357,3.5211,5.3515,0.6757,3.8704,4.5134,3.2923,5.5219,0.6545,9.4391,0.0009,3.0231,2.1626,5.3334,0.9659,4.0627,0.1393,1.3064,4.738,0.5599,3.06,0.9345,2.5368,0.0037,0.8834,0.0061,7.8518,4.771,1.3346,1.2732,1.6993,1.2307,0.0064,0.6698,0.6113,2.0947,5.1734,4.106,1.2588,5.613,0.0088,3.7144,7.422,0.0544,0.6946,4.5898,0.0303,1.1989,4.9906,0.0212,2.2407,0.0952,2.1684,3.406,0.1155,0.8244,3.1944,0.0117,0.8337,5.5348,5.2219,0.0068,7.3291,0.8986,0.6544,0.8897,4.6417,0.8129,3.9832,5.961,0.3903,0.8484,5.9901,0.0163,1.2349,0.0106,6.6017,1.7377,4.113,5.6505,0.0426,5.4103,3.5503,0.0133,0.0008,0.0233,2.1019,1.5254,6.4233,3.7066,8.1216,12.7499,1.1639,1.0887,0.469,6.1438,2.2227,2.0256,0.6093,4.2258,0.0012,2.2492,4.6089,2.7198,3.5612,0.7638,4.5046,1.4208,4.2673,6.1638,0.2319,0.0081,0.0022,0.0008,0.5524,3.9657,4.235,6.6919,0.0174,0.9052,3.7751,0.0482,2.4152,0.0052,0.0049,0.0008,0.0004,1.4064,4.4013,6.8172,0.0149,1.2916,2.8261,6.374,5.112,3.3875,0.0053,5.6558,2.3065,1.2996,0.6625,2.5727,2.0718,4.438,5.6192,0.2428,2.9395,4.0998,3.1324,8.0577,2.3464,4.0104,1.3454,4.0948,4.812,0.1233,3.5635,2.4692,1.1765,4.605,3.7157,2.3374,2.9214,1.8569,0.259,1.7299,0.0154,0.9542,1.4756,2.9678,0.0085,0.0055,0.001,0.0005,7.5102,2.1103,1.0202,1.4361,1.3742,4.2236,1.1147,1.533,0.2644,0.9853,3.2342,1.9822,7.6016,0.2516,2.1807,5.4176,1.6291,4.6916,4.8673,4.2847,4.3309,5.0397,10.6039,1.6222,4.618,3.0545,5.1754,6.1777,0.0023,1.2017,4.3166,1.9912,1.4465,3.518,5.7706,2.4856,2.7047,0.4427,1.94,2.474,2.7098,5.836,0.6116,4.9126,2.4245,5.9987,1.5919,1.8764,3.1421,0.451]}
{"id":4159,"ended":false,"length":533,"text":"Both Virginia Tech and Clemson endured questions about their coaching staffs in the weeks and months prior to the Gator Bowl. Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer was interviewed by North Carolina prior to the bowl game, and the Tigers' defensive coordinator, Ellis Johnson, was linked to the openings at Louisville and Miami, before deciding to stay at Clemson.\n\nVirginia Tech, Clemson, and their respective coaching staffs have all won on Sunday.\n\nJohnson's defensive scheme has not lost a step during his first year with the Tigers, as the Tigers are one of the nation's most-improved defense s and are ranked in the top ten nationally in turnovers forced and turnovers gained.\n\nClemson defensive coordinator Ellis Johnson on Sunday said the Tigers have had the nation's top defense this year. USATSI\n\nThe unit has only allowed one offense - Alabama - to score more than 17 points all season, while the top ten defenses in points allowed also include Florida State and Oklahoma State.\n\n\"If we can do that, we're going to give our team a chance to win any game we play in,\" Johnson said regarding the defense's performance against Alabama, according to The State.\n\nAs for Beamer, his coaching staff was able to work around questions about the Hokies' defensive coordinator Mike Reid. The former UNC quarterback served as Hokie defensive coordinator under Beamer from 2012-15, but then left for Arizona prior to the 2016 season. Under Beamer, the Tar Heels finished in the bottom half of the ACC almost constantly, but also only allowed an average of 27 points per game to their opponents.\n\nBeamer's defensive unit had a slow start the past two seasons, struggling to get to the quarterback and generate turnovers, but has improved significantly in 2017.\n\nVirginia Tech's defensive coordinator Mike Reid last year made many friends with some of his stunts. USATSI\n\nVirginia Tech had one of the worst defenses in the country against the run in 2016, but has come around considerably this season, ranking 12th in rushing defense.\n\nReid has also seen his defense thrive in the red zone, something that was a major problem last year which led to the Hokies being tied with Wake Forest for last in the NCAA with six red zone turnovers. Beamer's unit has only allowed three touchdown s in the red zone, which is tied for second nationally.\n\nClemson head coach Dabo Swinney, who was a finalist for the Alabama job last year and had his defensive coordinator offer that job to Beamer before landing in Florida, also addressed Reid last Monday.\n\n\"Everybody has their styles for what they do here,\" Swinney said about Reid last Monday, according to the Greenville News. \"He was recruited here as a great recruiter, a great leader, a great guy. What you see is what you get there.\"","token_len":589,"entropy":[10.0213,2.8365,1.3056,4.2856,9.5382,9.0147,0.8101,1.4021,4.9328,0.5486,2.4695,2.7079,1.1924,5.253,4.5117,0.0262,4.1764,0.1092,0.6238,7.239,0.1931,0.5364,1.0485,5.019,0.2553,3.9446,0.0117,5.6963,1.0065,0.0082,2.1127,4.1021,1.2197,8.2906,0.055,7.2152,0.0069,0.3283,4.8378,0.769,1.249,1.2441,2.2564,3.7201,2.3742,3.7025,0.2991,1.7845,10.463,3.5586,0.1838,0.8211,8.0443,0.3058,0.8014,10.7234,2.4512,5.3764,0.7209,2.5544,2.494,5.0483,5.5044,0.4713,3.1974,1.8404,2.0907,0.5781,0.6663,0.0003,4.0947,0.1529,3.6679,2.9865,1.5266,1.3776,6.7662,1.9758,1.9917,0.0592,0.0337,2.5703,1.8114,5.5224,6.7016,5.7398,1.0754,1.6376,0.0002,7.0087,2.2117,7.028,5.0893,2.1006,4.5549,5.089,2.1504,2.8301,3.6251,1.4633,3.37,2.5333,2.4689,0.2178,1.4182,0.9683,2.6743,2.28,2.6498,3.4681,4.1836,0.109,0.8405,2.5893,0.0032,2.7646,4.7324,2.7471,0.0491,5.0348,9.4115,3.5014,2.6168,2.0818,1.9134,0.0207,0.2416,2.9957,1.1844,0.6875,5.6134,8.4142,2.297,3.3051,4.6612,0.4978,1.0178,0.0002,3.9947,0.0,4.0063,0.1858,9.3952,0.0178,4.7385,1.5253,2.6416,2.1122,2.7306,2.1786,3.5061,3.3377,7.3561,0.0642,1.7344,1.5049,2.9234,1.3963,1.0097,7.6935,0.0122,0.0003,0.0254,0.0001,2.4513,7.4736,1.55,4.9765,2.1561,2.0145,5.7621,6.3339,4.3938,1.5633,0.4676,1.5997,1.6161,0.1984,4.2514,0.0307,5.8635,0.4636,1.3253,2.501,1.3014,4.899,3.4854,3.1034,0.9711,3.4644,0.2444,5.9281,2.8071,3.4334,0.3299,1.5889,3.4725,0.4048,0.2792,0.3399,0.0003,2.3704,4.5307,1.253,1.9395,2.9218,1.6694,0.8647,0.9927,1.5837,1.0527,0.0052,5.5388,1.9806,2.242,0.9496,1.3024,0.7957,0.8581,6.6987,0.6712,1.6802,1.4383,2.5285,0.9173,0.4125,0.1442,6.8528,0.9285,3.6117,2.4598,3.0561,1.7253,2.1001,2.5753,2.3882,0.0027,2.697,6.3315,1.811,1.2613,0.0002,4.6551,1.0361,4.7211,0.0005,0.5841,3.0722,3.2923,0.2284,2.85,5.3519,0.0052,5.1808,4.1379,5.0621,1.1351,1.7335,7.62,0.0097,0.4438,2.0486,2.6144,5.5725,11.4008,2.8582,2.183,1.6066,6.4854,4.408,7.9552,0.1631,5.5077,0.3829,2.3456,0.0507,3.3532,1.8929,0.0009,3.9058,2.9333,0.3079,1.8348,0.784,1.8259,5.3182,2.3787,2.4746,4.6323,6.8346,0.0037,0.6329,2.7965,0.1241,0.7469,7.1024,1.4696,0.0011,0.2524,0.6432,6.1144,0.0076,0.0011,3.166,2.7684,0.1371,2.0276,0.838,0.0939,0.1719,2.5337,10.8654,6.7409,1.0408,2.4887,4.1027,5.5928,2.5271,4.4673,0.3901,0.0582,4.8765,1.6125,0.5273,0.0426,3.9021,2.6048,0.937,0.5612,0.2777,0.0002,3.2458,0.0014,2.3469,2.513,4.404,3.8847,1.6137,6.937,0.0243,5.9565,1.1324,0.3676,0.8387,0.4288,6.7792,0.3347,3.0664,2.7016,0.4005,3.7764,1.3783,6.6289,3.1971,1.962,1.0551,2.5078,2.2947,3.5498,1.5945,2.982,0.8272,0.8435,0.0002,4.3425,0.024,1.5831,1.8096,1.2644,2.8415,2.0574,7.5539,1.2492,4.5317,6.5041,7.7108,1.5667,5.2649,0.1958,1.6524,15.2004,2.4665,4.5696,0.0005,0.0019,0.0863,0.0001,4.0357,0.0198,3.6672,3.338,0.404,0.33,2.5598,3.1457,0.3115,0.2344,0.8623,3.5581,1.5056,3.0337,2.0492,1.0252,0.4254,2.0124,2.1279,5.1289,3.1882,6.6926,1.9395,0.8355,1.4053,2.7287,4.1098,0.0034,0.4543,4.1033,1.1056,2.4727,1.1705,0.0002,3.2247,0.0151,1.7905,2.6916,4.4815,1.9048,2.5088,4.9023,2.1102,1.1293,2.671,0.157,0.794,6.9312,0.8164,2.3518,2.439,2.6075,2.595,3.0109,0.8046,8.1247,1.6926,0.0838,1.5112,2.4684,0.0221,2.6122,4.8332,2.3769,6.4245,0.0037,0.6151,6.3467,0.9808,0.246,4.6493,4.9966,4.4944,4.0288,0.1229,3.2944,0.4994,5.8365,0.0012,1.5581,3.0781,0.8605,4.2415,0.2356,2.2994,4.5144,11.0127,2.009,1.3338,1.4286,0.0149,1.6889,2.0521,1.1744,2.8611,0.3859,2.246,3.8466,0.5385,0.2342,0.0002,3.3921,0.0002,3.8175,0.0158,1.0799,0.0139,0.0002,0.0001,0.0,2.9754,0.6888,1.8792,2.8105,3.8729,0.0077,0.1296,0.3447,6.239,1.8783,1.5161,0.5332,3.464,3.3305,2.7278,5.0626,0.927,6.35,5.3787,3.366,1.6243,2.954,0.0007,4.0614,7.5111,2.6637,3.4286,0.3637,2.5502,5.4609,6.4652,3.7732,5.9132,0.4432,0.3699,0.0002,0.2509,5.9822,2.5659,2.306,7.2211,6.1333,2.6005,0.3716,1.2115,5.6071,1.1803,0.0607,0.0005,0.0009,0.1843,2.8483,2.1018,6.1705,2.0893,1.9309,0.2864,0.0026,1.792,7.3539,2.2536,1.8478,2.0379,0.1471,2.135,3.6257,7.6382,4.2689,3.3099,0.3088,4.5053,1.2899,0.0003,1.3066,2.7306,0.5366,4.3534,0.8045,1.2874,0.2929,2.9821,0.8871,5.6607,3.5839,1.9583,1.7268,2.5101,0.348,0.1984,6.3917,1.4267]}
{"id":343,"ended":true,"length":528,"text":"Reviewers have noted that Brooks uses World War Z as a platform to criticize government ineptitude, corporate corruption, and human short @ - @ sightedness. At one point in the book, Brooks takes center stage as a kind of action hero, who goes on a mission to find, and destroy, the zombie virus while being chased by the military. It's pretty funny.\n\nI've always been an avid reader of non-fiction (my favorite authors so far include Bill Bryson, Jonathan Safran Foer, and Paul Theroux), so this is a very welcome change-up for me. It makes it so easy to just read for an hour and learn something. Plus, zombie apocalypse!\n\nIn addition to World War Z, there are also three other titles in the series as well:\n\nWorld War Z : After the Fall has Brooks back leading a military team into the zombie apocalypse. He focuses heavily on the \"zombie-in-disguise\" aspect of the zombie virus and how it can infiltrate both the civilian and military community. He also spends a lot of time describing the government's initial reaction to the virus.\n\n: has Brooks back leading a military team into the zombie apocalypse.

{"id":1181,"ended":true,"length":537,"text":"With most work finished on the dam itself ( the powerhouse remained uncompleted ), a formal dedication ceremony was arranged for September 30, 1935, to coincide with a western tour being made by the United States Vice President, Arthur Vandenberg ( who had visited the site in 1931 ). The dedication was held under a large pavilion constructed on an island in the middle of the lake and an archway built between four columns of marble set in rockwork. The dam tower itself was erected on the shoreside, along with observation sheds, and, in the distance, a stone wall surrounding part of the lake to provide a scenic reserve.\n\nAfter the dam's completion in 1935 - 1936, the area had been planted with trees and shrubs that had originally been imported from Europe. In 1938, as work to extend the railway line further west was halted, parts of the lake were dried off and turned into grassland while the remainder remained wetland.\n\nFormal dedication ceremonies were held on 2 January and 17 August in 1958, as both dates were chosen to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War. The event took place again on 21 May 1960 and on 3 June 1970, to commemorate the 70th anniversary.\n\nThe dam was designed as a concrete gravity-type structure where the material was collected from a deep-water quarry in the area and dumped directly into the lake. This technique allowed the dam to be constructed at a minimum cost. However, as the dam was built closer to the site known as 'Norden' (a tributary of River Elbe) which was prone to flooding ( especially at high-water levels), a reinforced sandbag armour or concrete cap was installed in order to prevent flooding. The dam's foundations, excavated from the riverbed, were left in place and filled in with topsoil. The concrete wall that forms part of the foundation structure was also strengthened by reinforcing concrete.\n\nThe length of the dam is 7.4 km long (the longest in Europe ) and has a width of 1.2 km and a height of 21.2 m. The wall is made up of 10,737 m of reinforced concrete, over 1,500 m of reinforced concrete cap, and over 4,250 m of stone blocks and boulders. It is equipped with a powerhouse, which was built entirely of reinforced concrete. The original power station consisted of two units and was capable of producing 2,500 m3 of water per second and producing 17 MW. The original powerhouse equipment and generator sets were in operation until 1970. The first unit was replaced by two new units in 1976. With the coming of nuclear power into use, the waterworks were converted into a hydroelectric generating station with the existing powerhouse being converted into an electric power station and the original equipment being removed in 1995. The turbine and generator sets of the electric power station are capable of producing 9.1 MW.","token_len":593,"entropy":[6.5467,8.9507,9.4908,2.6485,1.3443,9.2987,5.9787,4.2749,9.3941,9.7426,8.7209,8.5904,0.0463,4.2049,3.8838,8.3389,6.4218,0.9778,1.1362,5.1826,1.5616,4.1504,3.3775,0.699,5.2939,1.3558,2.7317,4.106,0.0063,3.5894,9.8208,3.8447,6.5407,3.8808,1.1937,0.8895,3.6272,0.2276,9.2698,0.7305,1.3582,5.0891,7.6431,0.9897,3.4661,4.4462,1.7281,4.2242,1.1887,2.4741,1.4177,4.4462,1.6361,1.6773,5.4492,2.084,1.598,5.5703,2.0166,3.2795,5.3944,0.0029,5.6956,2.343,4.257,2.817,1.8433,0.3587,1.9541,0.0191,0.3716,2.398,2.8954,5.2416,5.0359,1.3968,4.4572,4.1375,6.0919,6.0883,0.644,5.0543,9.0118,1.9222,7.2967,7.4143,0.7896,1.2129,4.66,6.8742,4.6454,0.771,3.3061,1.6688,1.2698,4.877,5.897,2.4974,4.2531,0.1245,9.7584,7.0815,1.3608,2.1352,4.8188,2.2403,1.6017,5.1768,0.154,1.8275,6.4538,3.8399,6.2374,8.9416,0.0021,0.2168,4.6485,4.3903,3.4538,1.6136,6.3183,9.2696,0.975,1.8765,0.429,4.3972,0.9562,3.114,2.476,0.291,1.9073,2.2588,7.3967,9.2601,0.3916,1.0023,5.3348,3.7971,0.834,6.6627,0.7929,3.2869,1.2008,1.8809,0.0886,3.0915,1.3253,6.3289,0.2232,6.4659,0.2872,3.5083,1.4071,2.7438,3.1144,0.4944,4.8895,6.0795,5.0095,4.3601,0.2013,8.357,1.086,4.8839,3.0957,2.4347,6.5124,0.7256,7.002,0.0265,0.1544,2.944,0.4503,7.7006,3.727,0.9531,5.8043,0.3438,5.93,0.8947,7.261,1.2358,4.1177,2.9435,4.2134,3.0025,0.6713,2.5413,0.0003,5.8206,4.6864,1.2712,1.4852,0.9722,0.231,1.4525,6.883,3.2163,4.0737,5.0744,3.8814,3.6496,8.8616,1.2758,3.6826,6.0297,7.7417,0.8759,4.7667,1.2711,1.8831,0.3037,3.96,0.0722,0.0835,0.0316,0.2595,8.0792,0.0237,1.2795,3.2317,0.0083,0.0025,0.3819,1.6273,4.9491,2.7016,0.0087,7.4566,0.6537,3.601,3.0815,3.0388,2.67,3.0908,2.6669,1.7435,2.9656,1.2199,4.2854,1.4192,0.2585,3.4937,0.0409,0.0308,4.8598,0.8637,0.0002,1.6052,2.8485,1.1077,4.2054,3.2168,0.3706,4.9731,10.397,1.9004,7.1822,1.2325,5.6032,1.202,6.9165,2.2853,5.2541,1.9535,2.7244,4.8728,3.5692,0.5238,6.2112,2.5256,1.0614,3.903,2.356,5.2069,5.687,0.4752,0.3681,0.8739,0.6828,3.2834,4.3806,2.4248,1.0888,3.0031,0.2693,1.4659,3.1339,2.9359,0.9074,5.7651,5.071,4.6158,3.7491,0.0475,3.4235,1.0203,2.6976,0.9695,2.862,6.9961,0.0613,0.4737,5.1451,9.7972,0.0948,4.7711,4.9519,3.6544,4.2965,2.0499,1.1747,4.0066,6.5466,0.3183,0.0081,0.4757,7.1385,5.9715,1.6437,2.0328,4.5839,1.6551,7.8608,0.0149,0.978,4.0907,6.952,3.6035,2.9051,5.4818,0.73,1.1356,2.0768,3.6466,7.9174,8.3813,2.4478,10.9768,5.2791,3.1316,6.9642,0.8637,2.1824,2.8946,2.4441,0.021,1.7102,2.5116,0.7266,1.5914,3.4132,2.4032,5.1034,3.0726,7.0234,0.3999,1.1331,0.89,3.3136,3.8517,0.9234,0.5375,5.6397,1.5841,0.1354,2.4395,6.7444,2.9218,0.8393,7.4878,0.0904,0.0013,1.2884,1.4596,2.2833,5.5219,3.649,4.8007,3.7402,0.0009,0.1084,3.5299,5.9517,0.7611,2.6082,4.7792,2.5496,5.5692,2.9232,1.9822,1.105,0.0002,1.236,6.5986,0.1225,0.1422,0.9643,3.0118,4.288,1.013,2.5467,1.9875,5.1498,2.3453,4.9925,3.5893,2.0314,2.8179,4.7502,0.2876,3.3494,0.7742,2.7626,0.0493,2.724,0.2626,2.8997,0.1464,2.8763,0.4182,0.7746,0.0102,5.6333,0.6172,2.4096,0.6056,0.5264,0.9745,6.1177,1.3711,3.0615,2.5502,0.0278,4.6143,2.7025,5.1457,4.4885,2.4283,1.9997,3.9338,0.2467,1.7578,5.7978,2.7109,0.4345,3.1086,0.4578,0.0888,2.7007,0.8302,5.3437,1.0761,0.8391,2.7407,3.5353,0.2466,4.7866,0.0515,0.0265,6.4416,5.6695,3.1,6.0014,0.0012,0.3987,2.8302,0.9895,5.1668,0.0208,1.2248,10.7333,2.0913,2.8677,2.4127,2.4501,7.922,2.156,2.2778,0.1223,1.2103,1.2187,6.2511,5.3877,4.2687,5.7972,0.0319,2.7227,6.376,3.1798,1.3378,4.4725,0.0051,2.7997,4.1711,0.528,2.2807,3.2261,6.7348,0.2123,3.7118,0.7824,3.1088,3.3307,5.0632,5.8989,5.8182,3.0724,1.32,4.8841,7.436,8.167,4.4461,4.166,9.2908,0.378,4.6417,3.3616,3.3058,4.6643,0.9499,1.7842,4.2764,2.3019,0.8184,3.3871,1.2122,3.6369,2.6004,0.9289,1.5784,3.0572,0.9987,6.1725,0.6903,7.99,0.1313,6.2842,0.8481,5.988,4.3407,0.8928,0.608,4.6315,7.0691,0.8062,4.0114,0.7899,1.3844,3.9904,0.283,3.3137,0.7154,2.9597,2.5112,6.3544,5.291,4.1988,2.5501,0.4872,2.2198,2.2287,1.4534,0.7767,3.4522,1.6348,4.8412,5.2632,1.6337,4.0197,3.5624,4.9913,0.1475,1.651,5.3784,2.8681,1.3151,2.2326,4.3095,0.1698,7.1101,0.8438,0.3756,1.8111,5.65,0.0051,0.5047,4.8181,1.938,2.7844,0.5966,2.057]}
{"id":1308,"ended":false,"length":532,"text":"BSU started the fourth quarter by throwing two incomplete passes. Tharp then completed two passes for a combined 39 yards before Pirates'defender J.J. Milbrook intercepted Tharp's fifth pass of the quarter, returning it to the BSU 19-yard line. Four plays into the Pirates' next possession, Milbrook picked off Tharp a second time, this time setting up another Pirates score.\n\n\"We were concerned (about the offense),\" said Pitts. \"They didn't do anything different. They are a good second-half team, but we don't want our defense to have to make adjustments because we are not playing well on defense.\"\n\nHoffman put the Pirates up 7-0 with a 5-yard touchdown run that capped an 89-yard drive. BSU made a goal-line stand to force Pitts to attempt a 32-yard field goal \u2014 his fourth attempt of the night. Pitts' effort came up short of the mark, and the Pirates took a 13-0 lead into the final period.\n\n\"I have all confidence in my kicker,\" said Pitts. \"I know he can make any field goal. I know tonight he didn't have it. I know that in the coming weeks he will.\"\n\nBSU picked off Tharp one final time early in the fourth quarter, but Pitts was unable to get his team within field-goal range.\n\n\"We played the worst defensive football game that I could ever remember,\" said Pitts. \"There is no way I can use the excuse that we didn't have good players. There were just bad football decisions made. It could not have happened at a worse time. We played the worst game.\"\n\nTharp finished the night 18-of-37 for 190 yards with two touchdown passes, throwing for one first-half interception while tossing a second to Milbrook.\n\n\"They are as good a football team as I have ever seen, but we made some plays and we had an opportunity to win it,\" said Pitts. \"I won't accept anything else. We lost to a good football team, and I hope people will realize that. We have one week to get ready for Northern Iowa.\"\n\n\"They are what we expected,\" said Hoffman. \"We knew what we would get from them and we knew we had plenty of momentum going. But it came back to haunt us.\"\n\nPitts said he will look to his players to build off a tough game against the Panthers.\n\n\"I told the guys it is a good night to be a BSU Pirate,\" said Pitts. \"Nobody gave us a chance to be here, and we lost the first game we have played after getting into the (IAFC) playoffs. Now we are in another game where it is time to face adversity and fight.

{"id":527,"ended":true,"length":484,"text":"Around 04 : 00 on June 25, the KPA's 5th Division began its first attacks on the ROK 10th Regiment's forward positions. Three hours later, the 766th Regiment's two battalions began attacking the ROK 2nd Regiment's forward positions. Then, the ROK 1st Regiment's 1st Battalion rushed forward to cut off the attackers from the 5th Division's main body. The 1st Battalion, reinforced by the 1st Regiment's 2nd Battalion, overwhelmed the KPA's rear units, but suffered numerous casualties in the pursuit into North P'ungcheong County. In the early morning of June 25, KPA's Colonel Kim Han-su dispatched a special force to seize the ROK 3rd Regiment's 10th Battalion headquarters as its last line of defense. KPA Captain Kip Song-sik infiltrated a platoon into the base to infiltrate a KPA soldier inside the ROK headquarters.\n\nAt 06 : 00, the KPA's 3rd Battalion attacked the ROK 3rd Regiment's forward positions. Despite heavy rain and strong winds, the 5th Division's soldiers managed to resist for only an hour and a half. Meanwhile, the KPA's 5th Battalion attempted to overrun the ROK 3rd Regiment's 3rd Battalion forward positions, as well as attack the ROK 2nd Regiment's 2nd Battalion forward positions. On the other hand, the KPA's 3rd Battalion captured the ROK 3rd Regiment's headquarters without resistance. This prompted the ROK 6th Division's headquarters to order the ROK 2nd Regiment to withdraw a mile (1.6 km) from its current position. Around 7 : 00, the KPA's 3rd Battalion then attacked the ROK 5th Regiment's forward positions, but was pushed back by the ROK 2nd Regiment's heavy artillery.\n\nIn the early hours of the next day, the KPA's 5th Battalion attacked the ROK 6th Regiment's 10th and 11th Battalions. This time, the ROK 6th Regiment managed to maintain its position, but still suffered over 1,500 casualties.\n\nThe 5th Division attacked the ROK 1st Regiment's 3rd Company and 5th Company as well as the ROK 4th Regiment's 1st Company. The ROK 2nd Regiment attempted to block the advance, but the 5th Division's 2nd Battalion managed to capture the 2nd Regiment's headquarters. The ROK 2nd and 3rd Regiments then attacked the 5th Division's main body, but were repeatedly repulsed. In the morning of June 26, the ROK 6th Regiment's 2nd and 3rd Companies managed to push back the 5th Division's 2nd Battalion, while the ROK 4th Regiment's 2nd Company was ordered to withdraw. ROK soldiers retreated in such order that they would not expose themselves to artillery fire.","token_len":594,"entropy":[10.6001,8.0098,3.9393,6.4206,5.0136,3.7855,0.65,4.8392,6.6117,5.8256,3.6559,8.39,1.2057,4.2301,5.3849,2.0949,3.9153,8.0779,0.7983,0.9747,6.3192,4.1627,9.2945,1.7267,3.2594,3.1198,6.6623,0.8197,0.9476,5.7087,5.0302,0.4112,0.3166,1.2942,4.7192,8.5445,0.042,2.2536,1.7836,5.9474,3.2371,0.0015,2.8174,4.0321,0.7903,1.3926,0.0134,5.2819,0.1818,2.3653,0.423,2.4338,0.0558,0.4817,6.3165,1.0148,2.161,2.4202,0.0226,2.6127,0.0081,0.635,0.9892,3.3631,0.0173,1.1357,6.4303,2.4128,1.192,5.2043,1.1658,0.7055,5.972,3.1161,0.5888,5.2624,0.0656,0.4408,1.0108,4.4935,4.6864,1.0809,1.5145,4.0531,0.007,0.2414,2.9349,5.719,0.1513,1.7042,2.7636,0.0279,3.6664,0.6367,1.8292,0.2688,0.5253,0.2145,7.3912,0.341,5.0272,0.1163,0.7476,5.6274,6.3439,2.0654,2.921,5.3758,5.6181,0.3412,2.9965,0.4862,4.9798,8.424,7.8209,6.4112,7.9372,3.5888,8.3962,3.2296,6.2522,0.2983,3.6934,0.8027,3.5766,1.1811,0.6054,0.4496,1.6019,0.1251,3.878,0.0458,2.0407,8.7601,4.1373,6.0815,0.8941,4.8499,13.3987,1.6878,3.7574,2.7869,1.1559,4.8639,0.7424,2.3663,0.0307,3.9541,0.0193,0.6581,0.3412,5.0754,0.0339,2.6804,5.1883,5.5614,4.7004,3.575,2.7,0.1034,0.1306,0.284,3.9914,0.0085,8.2205,4.6079,5.4449,3.4546,0.1934,4.8448,0.7865,7.9872,3.8437,5.7365,5.9664,0.4137,5.1519,2.4018,5.3956,2.3588,3.451,0.1257,5.6177,6.4653,1.077,3.6881,0.0243,3.2223,0.5906,4.7636,0.1148,3.4317,4.3524,2.2611,1.9483,1.5209,0.7495,1.5188,0.0033,0.3337,2.9169,0.0153,0.9373,3.436,0.5389,1.155,0.0144,2.534,0.0236,0.3178,0.2105,3.3315,0.0995,0.6575,5.5916,3.8039,5.5252,1.3181,3.8645,0.9644,0.1952,0.4014,4.3598,0.0404,0.3817,0.8772,5.4688,2.35,0.0096,5.6951,5.5687,4.4746,3.9972,0.0893,2.0793,1.114,0.0027,0.7326,4.4416,0.0331,0.5921,1.9337,0.0055,0.3486,3.6257,0.0066,3.1196,4.9877,0.1346,5.6019,0.4721,0.8446,0.0101,2.0806,0.0183,0.1462,0.1166,3.3122,0.0186,0.8098,6.0493,0.1347,2.0476,5.4337,0.9512,0.0505,4.9973,0.6846,1.3871,0.0174,1.2485,0.0147,0.4402,0.0278,2.0138,0.0193,0.1351,3.3844,0.0206,0.1819,3.7369,1.3559,4.334,0.9149,0.0064,0.3057,0.9125,0.0029,0.1432,2.1219,0.0174,0.0561,5.6023,0.6758,0.7879,0.0188,1.7028,0.0399,0.1604,0.0247,6.8424,5.2097,3.6996,0.5647,4.2082,5.3643,0.5003,1.9415,0.0334,4.8148,0.0052,1.6196,1.5532,6.2886,0.3865,5.587,1.3207,2.8786,0.0451,2.4769,0.022,0.9988,1.5702,1.6587,6.4261,4.8972,4.5431,0.62,0.2281,2.2501,0.4201,0.0184,1.3166,1.7568,6.1677,0.4897,0.4917,7.8545,7.0825,1.7318,1.2695,0.4481,0.2936,0.8416,0.0021,0.029,2.0023,0.0131,0.0749,6.3201,1.5024,0.1721,0.3756,0.0161,2.5565,0.0268,0.4321,0.0253,2.1307,0.0176,1.9902,2.6473,2.121,5.0924,0.078,0.6875,0.8143,1.1725,0.0597,1.9373,0.0224,0.2494,0.2306,5.0989,1.617,0.9109,1.9096,0.0002,3.2175,0.4474,1.7587,2.9152,0.0272,2.3197,3.7881,0.8449,0.0703,0.5347,0.9088,0.0024,0.0972,2.3518,0.0063,0.8002,1.944,0.241,0.3228,0.013,2.8924,0.0031,0.0393,0.0124,4.0638,0.0013,6.818,2.4282,0.0066,2.8997,0.0001,1.5851,3.6928,2.037,0.226,0.5707,1.3342,0.0457,1.2774,0.0023,0.5633,5.813,0.0112,5.3528,0.7308,1.3496,2.0656,0.491,6.1133,1.6161,6.7665,3.8399,0.1375,1.8698,0.0461,0.5828,2.3556,0.0002,2.1559,3.3273,0.0205,0.8166,4.9692,0.459,0.4872,0.0189,1.8538,0.0072,1.1054,0.0533,2.1772,0.0059,5.3499,2.9985,4.808,0.0102,2.7359,6.0308,0.4263,0.2941,0.729,1.0395,0.0398,2.7905,0.013,1.8081,0.0667,2.0318,0.0078,2.0601,0.8137,1.2566,0.9322,0.0619,2.2051,0.0324,1.3653,4.3359,0.0426,4.514,0.3667,2.5705,2.7894,0.1343,2.3668,2.2109,0.0038,1.5047,1.0375,2.8407,0.0272,0.7885,2.4122,0.0096,4.6324,0.5204,3.9109,0.0232,4.3494,0.0931,2.4703,0.8901,1.6132,0.9321,0.0676,1.8903,0.0735,4.4081,0.9081,0.1152,4.8205,0.0089,1.9122,2.1233,0.2054,2.5035,0.0065,1.7091,0.1752,4.4654,0.1023,1.226,0.9603,0.573,7.3599,5.9235,0.0049,0.0004,1.7715,2.7611,0.2181,2.3967,0.5369,0.443,0.2821,0.0398,0.2856,1.4263,0.0596,1.9979,0.0036,0.373,0.85,1.3826,0.0104,2.9942,0.4348,0.0125,1.7659,5.1674,0.0062,3.4589,0.9215,0.2839,2.6556,0.0041,0.3775,0.1826,2.0816,0.0138,0.7012,2.0576,2.4973,0.2627,0.5119,0.0611,1.6257,0.0033,1.017,0.4333,1.7531,0.0137,2.4504,2.2373,5.8766,0.1848,1.2596,1.06,6.3569,0.1529,5.5789,5.4452,3.4953,7.3008,7.6781,0.6369,2.0084,3.9939,1.011,8.8563,0.825,0.2422,5.12,0.0934,0.7264]}
{"id":1454,"ended":false,"length":521,"text":"Cooksey joined Oldham Athletic on trial in July 2003. At the age of 23, he stepped up three leagues into professional football permanently when Iain Dowie signed him on for financially troubled Oldham Athletic on a free transfer, having turned down an offer of a new three-year deal, and a transfer fee, from Peterborough United.\n\nContents\n\nAfter playing once in the first team in the opening four weeks of the season, Cooksey dropped down the pecking order at the DW Stadium and only made two second-team appearances, scoring once, before being released. He was also offered a new and improved contract at Peterborough United but turned it down and joined Oldham Athletic on a free transfer.\n\nCooksey made his debut for Oldham in a 1\u20130 defeat to Lincoln on 17 August 2004. He then spent the first part of the season on loan to Stockport County of League One. In March 2005, Cooksey rejoined Stockport County on loan for the rest of the 2004\u201305 season. He returned to Oldham in the summer of 2005, scoring a hat-trick in his first start for the club.\n\nCooksey had joined Oldham for an undisclosed fee, but in July 2015 it was announced the fee was \u00a3100,000.[1]\n\nAged 31, Cooksey joined Halifax as part of their pre-season recruitment, linking up with his former Latics teammate James Vaughan. He made his third appearance for the club on 11 August 2006 when Halifax were losing 2\u20130 at Oxford United but scored his first goal for the club as Halifax defeated Yeovil on 21 August 2006. When Vaughan was then sold to Bradford City, Cooksey was moved to centre back and played most of the season in the position.\n\nOn 27 July 2010, Cooksey signed a first professional contract with Halifax Town[4] having left the club early on release. He returned to Oldham on transfer deadline day on 2 February 2012 with former Halifax Town manager Andy Dixon, his brother Ian, joining him at The Shay.[5] His first season in his first loan spell back at Oldham ended in play off semi-final heartbreak. In October 2012 it was announced that Cooksey would be allowed to leave on loan by manager Andy Dixon.[6] He made his debut for Halifax Town on 15 November 2012 in a 0\u20130 draw against Port Vale. However, he would only make 2 league appearances and a further 2 cup appearances for the Shaymen.

{"id":568,"ended":true,"length":536,"text":"Desperate Housewives focuses on the lives of several residents living on Wisteria Lane. In recent episodes, Susan ( Teri Hatcher ) and Mike Delfino ( James Denton ) celebrate the birth of their young twin daughters, who are named after Susan\u2019s parents, John and Alice, before the kids are shipped off to Texas while Susan takes time off work in order to deal with their loss.\n\nA Desperate Housewives TV show official synopsis for the episode entitled Life After Loss details the aftermath of Susan giving birth, dealing with the death of her mother and learning that she has Stage 4 colon cancer. The synopsis reads, \u201cAfter giving birth to twin girls, Julie ( Felicity Huffman ) confronts Mary ( Marcia Cross ) about the loss of her mother and Julie\u2019s suspicions about Mary\u2019s marriage. Meanwhile Bree ( Felicity Huffman ) faces her own grief while helping with her grandchildren while Susan ( Teri Hatcher ) battles Stage 4 colon cancer.\u201d\n\nIt looks like in this new episode both Susan and Julie may have been right about Mary\u2019s marriage being in trouble given Mary\u2019s suspicious behavior when her husband comes home for his annual business trip. Bree will also be grieving after her mother\u2019s death as she takes over the care of her children.\n\nElsewhere, Susan\u2019s mother may have died from cancer, but it sounds like she could be making a surprise return at some point in the future according to the synopsis. If that is the case hopefully it\u2019s true, but also that Susan\u2019s cancer ends up working out for the best and that both Bree and Julie get closure about the loss of their mothers.\n\nWhat do you think of this synopsis of Desperate Housewives Season 8 Episode 13? Do you think Susan\u2019s mother will make a return? What do you think the secret is that Mrs. Delfino ( Marcia Cross) has been keeping? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.\n\nIn addition to all of this, it does seem that the season might come to a close sooner than later. In December it was revealed that in the next few weeks ABC will air three additional episodes, bringing Desperate Housewives to what would be the standard length of 22 episodes. The episode in which Susan gives birth to twin babies was shot just prior to when the season came back from its winter hiatus. Some of the original cast, including Eva Longoria, Teri Hatcher and Marcia Cross were unable to be on set, so it seems a good bet that one of the three guest episodes will feature the three of them.\n\nThe upcoming episodes of Desperate Housewives are scheduled to air in May so it may be soon that we find out more about what\u2019s going on in the Wisteria Lane neighborhood and also the lives of the other members of the cast.","token_len":596,"entropy":[8.9783,5.7322,0.3744,10.1836,0.1588,1.312,4.4561,0.0994,5.594,6.0917,3.9222,2.473,7.71,6.2015,0.011,5.1583,1.5892,4.0911,5.3437,4.1687,0.331,7.6478,3.9308,13.3904,1.3131,2.5609,0.0678,0.2975,1.2937,6.3119,10.7309,6.1507,0.1748,0.1909,6.0687,3.373,4.5601,0.2085,7.423,1.8472,3.133,0.1298,0.156,4.9961,7.2131,1.1786,0.9037,3.5878,1.1161,4.189,2.5087,5.1595,15.1153,8.2353,3.1588,3.2251,1.8377,6.0871,0.5126,5.8373,3.3699,5.7654,2.6058,5.2917,1.6585,6.1697,1.064,0.1345,4.7398,6.5808,2.6074,4.5556,4.768,1.3211,1.8514,3.807,1.0216,0.0214,4.5402,0.0016,2.8985,5.1507,0.4957,2.0882,0.0027,4.4117,8.0758,0.0012,0.0012,0.1721,6.2413,3.0966,11.7301,3.8718,1.6028,1.2325,3.5077,6.4167,7.7973,3.0983,5.9626,6.3529,0.8897,3.9185,0.1221,1.9565,8.6193,0.0334,3.3581,7.5945,0.0412,1.1524,4.0391,0.0361,0.5172,3.3209,1.5584,6.833,1.097,1.5953,1.8886,11.8405,0.9542,4.9008,0.0125,0.3554,1.998,5.1008,2.8837,1.6658,9.4358,8.1534,6.9349,5.6866,0.0167,0.7314,5.308,1.8179,0.6944,6.2024,1.2441,7.7435,1.0583,0.9693,0.1745,0.6236,5.3405,6.29,0.4216,7.6633,0.3948,7.3867,0.4216,0.6321,1.9474,2.5746,0.158,0.3546,1.8501,1.2424,5.0721,3.8123,0.1248,0.0075,8.5921,1.3584,3.5393,1.4251,0.0035,0.053,5.3636,0.7678,5.3787,13.8686,0.3806,6.4478,0.1018,0.0392,0.0011,0.1739,5.5289,2.101,1.2973,5.0831,4.282,6.4543,4.3643,1.7886,6.2934,3.4049,3.2524,2.8255,1.217,0.0007,0.0006,0.0003,0.0184,5.8145,8.7118,0.6224,2.2111,0.0342,0.4135,8.2056,5.0678,0.524,0.0003,5.3931,6.7036,0.1243,6.1101,1.9243,5.2121,1.0982,7.0098,1.6584,0.1793,0.9871,5.0654,1.6939,2.492,7.4632,1.0299,2.8802,2.1197,0.0046,0.0197,2.0539,4.6669,3.9409,3.6751,8.7016,3.4371,1.9422,0.002,0.0236,8.4133,1.7407,4.1046,3.4169,2.3752,5.7018,1.0454,3.8,3.3491,4.5439,4.1045,0.5602,0.6231,6.9174,4.6179,2.2788,1.2324,6.0327,3.6333,2.4279,2.6768,7.7464,0.02,0.0168,0.9156,2.7898,0.7599,4.1106,4.7142,1.6647,2.5665,0.0542,0.8901,2.2572,1.4868,0.7491,0.0003,7.423,1.3346,2.7026,4.7735,0.005,0.0192,2.9883,5.4182,0.6281,3.8511,2.4542,2.2616,1.7831,1.5355,2.6603,5.4733,0.1721,1.2694,4.5882,1.1703,4.5474,1.2316,7.0485,1.8784,4.1402,0.7601,0.008,1.4,0.1495,0.5645,7.3934,0.0034,1.2792,1.9607,0.34,5.5962,1.522,2.0811,0.5225,0.0059,12.3844,2.9522,9.896,0.5039,0.007,5.5646,2.7865,2.0881,5.4549,3.2035,1.8714,1.7265,0.0013,0.0053,4.85,8.7324,0.3691,5.925,3.2188,2.8207,2.6274,4.0828,2.2947,1.5489,6.0515,5.2733,0.1353,0.2359,6.3537,7.4341,4.8716,2.0348,1.0585,0.1862,0.1774,3.8878,0.5413,0.3863,0.0003,4.4403,0.4711,0.0306,0.0926,1.0512,1.105,3.9871,4.8501,3.7915,0.0011,0.0052,0.0047,2.4013,3.2939,3.4704,4.2705,0.4072,2.3396,0.0304,0.795,2.7623,2.8282,0.0018,0.0051,1.6483,2.3073,3.2111,0.5956,0.6742,1.7675,3.0278,0.8475,0.0105,0.0791,3.8818,8.6209,2.9302,4.1182,8.0807,0.0845,4.301,0.0557,0.001,2.6465,7.2093,0.0426,0.0679,3.9933,2.5196,1.6311,3.9467,4.9648,1.2556,0.0175,0.0035,1.6262,0.071,0.4016,0.0171,0.0659,0.5597,0.7478,0.5282,0.0005,4.3253,1.8141,0.324,4.7008,1.1908,2.395,0.8063,3.3768,5.575,1.3109,2.0652,1.8087,2.7309,5.3023,5.1422,0.738,0.8843,0.4622,6.4171,0.9544,4.1959,0.9126,3.0832,5.5056,4.1174,0.6284,1.0316,0.0902,5.1972,1.4188,3.5888,3.7105,1.899,7.7084,0.9884,2.6232,4.5554,3.5709,0.7994,3.167,4.4254,7.0093,0.0039,0.028,0.0078,0.8274,8.1603,3.697,1.1768,0.9034,10.5646,4.3974,0.7304,6.4873,0.2585,0.5739,2.4634,3.9131,5.2576,4.9001,1.1973,3.7059,0.0063,1.4025,3.056,4.2887,2.4562,4.5769,4.7484,3.7942,0.0039,7.6699,1.3093,2.225,5.0626,4.2104,2.6419,2.4002,5.6923,0.1339,0.5293,6.394,2.7274,0.5095,4.0432,1.1363,4.903,0.8036,8.0185,1.2275,0.0004,0.7,5.7644,0.0661,0.0075,0.0006,1.1445,5.8282,0.0543,0.0907,3.0368,6.0197,0.0067,3.1578,3.2083,2.047,3.3006,2.0442,2.1672,1.7358,5.1294,3.365,2.7601,0.3259,5.1411,0.746,0.8288,4.2699,7.1799,7.6122,0.7254,4.6606,2.525,4.8275,2.8341,0.086,1.1848,0.8557,0.0003,2.8345,4.3802,3.342,1.2418,0.3045,0.0003,0.0027,0.0043,2.5449,2.17,0.3183,0.634,2.1076,3.6994,6.4844,2.3522,3.4795,0.6004,5.9974,1.1226,2.4183,4.1601,0.0226,1.888,0.2127,2.5795,13.6446,0.6388,0.1285,0.7962,0.5958,1.3406,0.8154,6.1098,0.0301,0.0018,0.3356,3.3657,2.5211,6.2296,2.7304,4.8805,0.1346,1.0985,3.6542,3.9481,0.0827,0.3292,0.9581,0.3839]}
{"id":3855,"ended":true,"length":532,"text":"In March 2007, Tom Potter handed his control of Eagle Boys on to NBC Capital, a Queensland @ - @ based venture capital group. He retained some shares in the company, however, which became the subject of a protracted private prosecution by a bitter former associate. The case settled out of court in November 2008, with both parties taking their separate ways. As the matter was ongoing through the courts, there was no possibility for us to make contact with the owner. The company was trading under the name \"Pursuit Foods Group, Pty Ltd. \"\n\nAt this point, Tom Potter and I started receiving emails from Pursuit Foods Group, purporting to be from one Michael Stolte (email address michaels@f1g2.com ). The emails were almost identical in tone to the ones sent by Tom in his previous capacity as a company director.\n\nIn the emails, Michael Stolte offered to buy our shares in Eagle Boys for the market rate and that we will be awarded our company pension if our board members approved the sale of the company to him. It was also intimated that he was prepared to pay a substantial amount of money to have us killed and to have our family members and associates killed. To date, Michael Stolte has shown no desire to contact the company for further details and as such I have no doubt that this is an attempt at intimidation and blackmail.\n\nThe emails contained a reference to a website : \"Eagleboys Ltd\". The website link led users to this site.\n\nIt is important to note that \"Eagle Boys Ltd\" was registered at the domain name registration : aol.com.au from 19 Feb 2004 to 17 Aug 2016 by the name of \"Pursuit Foods Group Pty Ltd. \"\n\nIt is currently registered at the following domain name registration : gandi.net from 19 Oct 2014 to 27 Oct 2016 by the name of \"Tower Media Network\".\n\nThe only time \"Eagle Boys Ltd\" was ever active is when it was registered at aol.com.au.

{"id":3735,"ended":true,"length":524,"text":"Zuko lies on the ground twitching as Katara and Azula fight. After several minutes of running and being unable to gain the advantage at first, Katara freezes Azula and chains her to the ground. As Azula is chained, she begins to scream, prompting Azula to yell, \"Agh! No, don't do this!\" before she breaks free out of the chains and charges at Katara. Aang and Katara stand back and observe the fight. Zuko's injuries are slowly starting to subside, prompting Aang, Katara and Zuko to make their way to the city to find help. They later find help in Iroh, who treats Zuko for his injuries. When Zuko asks how Aang got hurt, Iroh responds, \"I didn't.\" as he leaves.Zuko angrily berates Katara, asking why she didn't leave Azula to face Azula while he fought Zuko. He accuses her of being scared and runs off. He is later shown with Jinora, who is carrying a blanket and water. He informs her that everyone must be asleep and asks her to take care of Zuko. Later, as Azula is being treated, Zuko approaches her in his firebender form and tries to convince her to go to sleep; however, Azula refuses, claiming that he is \"a liar\" and \"a fake\" and telling him that she will kill him. At the end of the episode, Katara apologizes and admits that she is scared of losing Zuko, and this angers him even further, which causes him to turn back to his firebending form and attack Katara (who had a waterbending barrier erected around her). Aang later tries to reason with the enraged Zuko, but the latter refuses to listen.Aang asks Jinora to send Zuko away so that he can regain his composure before they all depart. Jinora obeys, sending Zuko and Azula through the tunnel.Zuko is furious with Aang, saying that it was foolish of him to leave them behind and that he hates himself for being so weak. Zuko then tells Katara that he cannot believe she would run away from him like this, and it angers Zuko even further when Azula tells him that he would never have forgiven her if she had run off. Both Azula and Zuko then realize that they must work together to get out of the cave and, despite Zuko's initial anger, they work together fairly well and Zuko and Azula work together to overcome the danger in the cave.\n\nTrivia\n\nIt is likely that the scene in which Zuko yells and attacks Katara was the episode which first introduced Aang's friendship with Katara. While the scenes before this scene suggest that Zuko and Katara never had a close friendship prior to the series, they did begin to establish an alliance with each other while travelling.","token_len":598,"entropy":[10.7193,9.8904,2.2659,0.6069,1.0914,8.3521,0.1777,2.8636,8.7679,0.2119,3.2218,6.5744,0.1628,4.8102,1.714,4.552,4.3264,1.2268,1.0921,5.4324,2.924,5.4591,4.4589,0.0008,6.2724,2.719,5.1175,5.7362,3.2789,0.2002,1.508,0.0037,8.0684,4.3949,0.0001,1.4887,8.3633,0.6199,1.2763,0.3367,0.2624,0.7752,2.7774,1.707,0.0002,2.8714,6.5184,1.0667,1.8605,3.5926,0.525,2.3544,2.0333,5.182,1.6157,0.001,0.0697,5.3052,1.7704,0.0765,4.9807,4.4081,1.5378,4.7904,2.0482,3.6675,0.0012,3.0609,2.6859,0.9263,4.107,2.3736,4.5147,0.7098,8.6124,0.2591,0.5565,2.7237,1.2564,4.6773,0.5372,0.7518,0.0017,0.4689,4.935,6.8655,2.331,3.0744,0.0097,4.8789,2.7341,3.5855,6.0852,1.0694,2.1439,1.0465,6.7867,0.0002,4.0835,6.2298,1.0212,6.3294,2.5236,0.0092,4.3855,0.0006,1.3071,6.6218,4.7601,0.0011,4.3457,2.5688,0.004,0.8497,3.1251,0.001,0.0648,5.0119,2.0404,0.5224,0.9042,0.6178,5.7701,2.342,2.996,3.4954,0.2475,3.2921,4.3878,1.6866,6.2998,4.2512,7.3963,0.0149,1.712,0.6194,8.165,2.2248,0.0003,4.2383,1.8069,0.6701,0.5633,3.5659,1.5703,0.0004,3.1449,3.3985,3.3981,0.0016,2.2863,2.9572,0.111,2.0515,0.0009,3.4032,0.9803,0.0309,1.8162,3.3777,0.0005,4.9903,8.3785,1.036,5.5715,1.729,7.2262,0.0013,7.254,4.8951,0.0005,3.6464,0.0036,2.2968,3.4818,2.1553,0.8269,2.7183,0.0004,3.6778,3.7354,0.0023,2.8971,6.0981,2.126,0.0038,3.8549,1.7728,4.5027,2.867,0.0012,0.5082,2.6918,4.7259,0.8739,0.047,1.2631,6.066,1.5848,6.8656,0.9329,1.1795,2.6337,3.2289,1.5379,3.7673,3.3214,7.1156,1.5161,1.3456,1.202,1.808,5.6462,1.409,6.5417,2.2644,5.4103,2.6579,1.8518,4.7546,1.2175,0.5383,5.8574,4.004,2.5226,6.7212,1.9045,2.8864,0.8721,0.9762,3.2273,2.5853,0.0307,2.908,0.0005,0.6861,4.6753,0.4249,3.8406,3.0609,0.0047,1.3966,2.1463,2.6778,1.3022,1.4079,0.0004,5.5271,1.6027,3.9696,2.5349,8.7795,6.378,1.0873,1.1289,4.1091,0.028,3.2832,0.1423,0.5239,3.1482,1.7365,1.1998,6.225,1.8221,0.0657,2.7354,0.0013,1.8126,1.4997,3.1011,0.6395,2.4635,1.6133,4.6941,3.0936,5.568,1.7245,0.3208,3.1351,1.5082,6.9614,1.9945,0.9341,4.3746,0.8284,1.3445,1.3271,2.1598,3.5295,0.4404,1.2669,5.424,1.0116,1.9736,0.1118,0.2752,1.6413,0.1072,3.2626,0.0109,4.7433,0.0126,2.561,4.9092,0.6499,0.4041,2.4893,3.6748,1.7381,5.335,1.1318,0.0004,1.4406,2.063,6.8012,8.0836,0.008,3.6993,3.9573,2.2761,2.3608,4.2546,2.6086,0.6527,0.0154,4.2908,3.0575,0.6461,1.8235,3.5629,0.2657,2.0495,1.8696,3.6912,2.0025,0.0012,6.5803,1.2285,4.2159,4.0819,7.0189,1.2424,5.8425,4.9224,1.6566,0.2479,1.1393,4.7855,0.0889,3.167,4.1134,0.0687,6.625,0.0326,3.4978,5.4884,0.6969,0.0004,0.824,1.5092,2.943,2.6922,2.8785,0.5074,1.0534,2.0013,4.8939,0.0899,4.3377,4.7779,0.0009,1.7271,5.413,2.5596,0.0013,3.5468,3.1001,0.8447,1.0402,0.2553,6.5227,0.4196,4.6093,4.0688,4.3562,4.4793,3.7685,0.8171,4.1121,0.0003,9.4543,0.0034,1.0751,5.6902,1.1679,0.001,3.0129,1.9347,0.0018,4.3673,0.7707,4.9197,1.4905,4.2008,0.0039,2.4619,5.5489,2.3313,2.4188,0.0008,1.7117,2.913,0.254,3.8756,1.5267,6.6462,0.6669,0.2514,0.1353,3.4123,3.497,1.3788,1.7504,1.2224,0.6487,6.1358,5.3927,0.7511,2.3376,1.5568,2.7718,0.4522,1.6724,0.0015,2.3177,2.3508,4.1455,0.0032,0.5541,0.8446,4.3525,4.315,3.8115,2.7468,5.5048,0.7382,0.9987,0.5946,3.3912,1.1358,1.2522,1.2259,5.2489,5.654,0.0053,2.0543,0.0015,3.1452,0.9782,3.197,3.1776,0.0007,2.6691,0.2715,0.418,1.3573,3.2822,1.7231,3.2306,6.8352,0.8155,1.592,1.1403,1.0488,3.9593,3.2116,1.5197,6.984,3.5054,0.0071,0.022,0.6653,0.0002,2.6649,4.8554,0.2976,1.2577,3.677,6.5156,0.125,0.7222,2.631,3.4556,0.1456,1.0958,4.0397,1.6791,5.9353,4.6136,2.1166,0.0018,0.4218,5.4404,2.8748,0.3567,1.4694,3.5687,0.1033,8.5696,0.2373,3.595,3.8616,0.0013,3.1036,1.0893,0.0029,3.9102,0.5686,1.0373,5.7334,1.1602,6.1425,3.4145,0.411,0.7103,0.3853,2.9984,0.0002,5.6373,0.4155,0.0002,4.7549,0.4024,3.3109,0.2849,1.8201,3.8172,1.5605,0.4942,1.4766,0.0004,7.0673,4.1446,4.2681,0.8582,0.0016,2.0502,3.2257,5.6322,6.0225,2.7463,2.6683,2.9978,0.0023,2.4419,6.4911,0.1008,1.7562,0.0242,0.6651,4.7231,2.3142,3.9503,4.3362,3.7611,1.7379,6.6195,0.4332,1.7823,0.0017,1.5772,0.8038,0.0042,5.4997,2.7981,1.2178,2.8899,1.6649,3.8638,0.0552,1.0878,3.395,0.6727,2.6951,2.3116,5.1365,0.845,7.0288,2.9586,3.3454,1.9227,1.075,0.0086,5.1391,6.323,3.0643]}
